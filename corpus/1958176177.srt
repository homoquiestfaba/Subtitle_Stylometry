1
00:02:31,786 --> 00:02:34,722
- Bob, what are you doing?
It's 10 o'clock.

2
00:02:34,856 --> 00:02:36,624
- Just finishing up
some stuff here.

3
00:02:36,758 --> 00:02:38,926
- Get outta
here. Go home.

4
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:40,128
- Yeah, I will.

5
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,529
Couple more minutes.

6
00:02:41,663 --> 00:02:42,830
- Bob, I'm not asking.
I'm telling, okay?

7
00:02:42,964 --> 00:02:44,532
Go drink some eggnog
or something.

8
00:02:44,666 --> 00:02:47,769
It's Christmas, for Christ sakes

9
00:02:47,902 --> 00:02:48,903
- Merry Christmas.

10
00:02:49,037 --> 00:02:50,303
- Fuck you.

11
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:55,810
- You don't care!

12
00:02:56,811 --> 00:02:59,212
Calm? Stop telling me
to calm down!

13
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:00,347
- They'll call the cops.

14
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:01,883
- Good, let them call the cops.

15
00:03:02,016 --> 00:03:02,984
I'll talk to the cops.

16
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:04,552
They're gonna arrest your ass.

17
00:03:04,686 --> 00:03:05,119
- Yeah, you want that now?

18
00:03:05,953 --> 00:03:07,387
You know what's going on
with the cops?

19
00:03:07,522 --> 00:03:08,221
You don't know
what the fuck happened?

20
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:09,389
- What?

21
00:03:12,093 --> 00:03:13,561
I want a fucking divorce.

22
00:03:13,695 --> 00:03:16,831
I'm not fucking happy with you.

23
00:03:16,964 --> 00:03:18,331
Oh, don't say shit

24
00:03:18,465 --> 00:03:19,767
I can't come back with,
I hate you, motherfucker.

25
00:03:19,901 --> 00:03:20,902
I hate you.

26
00:03:21,035 --> 00:03:22,402
You don't even give a fuck.

27
00:03:22,537 --> 00:03:23,504
- Just another husband,
huh?

28
00:03:23,638 --> 00:03:25,006
- Yeah, just another husband.

29
00:03:25,139 --> 00:03:27,441
Just another lying sack-of-shit
husband like you.

30
00:03:36,984 --> 00:03:37,785
- Hey.

31
00:03:37,919 --> 00:03:39,087
- Ho, ho, ho.

32
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,888
Look out the window.

33
00:03:53,333 --> 00:03:54,669
- Hi.

34
00:03:54,802 --> 00:03:55,670
- Hey, kid.

35
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:58,072
How's it going?

36
00:03:58,206 --> 00:04:00,074
- Yeah, I'm okay.

37
00:04:00,208 --> 00:04:01,441
- What is it?

38
00:04:02,275 --> 00:04:03,711
- Nothing.

39
00:04:03,845 --> 00:04:06,413
It's just that I saw this
family today at the market,

40
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:07,882
a mother and father.

41
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:11,886
And this kid was riding
some dumb airplane ride.

42
00:04:12,019 --> 00:04:15,656
And then when it was over,
the mother asked the boy,

43
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:18,425
"What do you wanna do now?"

44
00:04:18,559 --> 00:04:19,894
Just, like in that moment,

45
00:04:20,027 --> 00:04:23,064
they could do whatever
they wanted, you know?

46
00:04:23,197 --> 00:04:24,464
As a family.

47
00:04:26,901 --> 00:04:27,835
- Yeah.

48
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:31,239
- I told you it was stupid.

49
00:04:33,608 --> 00:04:35,710
- Nah, it's not stupid.

50
00:04:38,012 --> 00:04:39,514
How's your mother?

51
00:04:40,447 --> 00:04:41,849
- Uh, she's okay.

52
00:04:43,117 --> 00:04:46,154
- Well, wish her a Merry
Christmas for me, okay?

53
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:48,156
- Yeah, I will.

54
00:04:48,288 --> 00:04:49,624
Goodnight.

55
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:52,660
- Goodnight, sweetheart.

56
00:05:06,174 --> 00:05:07,008
- Mom?

57
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:12,880
Hello?

58
00:05:31,966 --> 00:05:33,968
- No!

59
00:05:35,102 --> 00:05:39,040
- Cyrus, look what I found.

60
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,641
Look at her. Look here!

61
00:05:41,175 --> 00:05:42,409
- No!
- Look at that.

62
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:49,851
- Get off me! No!
Get off me!

63
00:05:50,885 --> 00:05:52,854
No. No!

64
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:48,475
- One for you. One for you.

65
00:06:48,609 --> 00:06:50,511
Here's one for you.

66
00:06:59,754 --> 00:07:01,454
- Arthur? Arthur.

67
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:02,623
Santa!

68
00:07:02,757 --> 00:07:04,525
Have you seen Gabi?

69
00:07:06,260 --> 00:07:07,561
Have you seen Gabi?
She's supposed to meet me here.

70
00:07:07,695 --> 00:07:08,996
Her phone's been busy all mornin

71
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,231
- You call the house?

72
00:07:10,364 --> 00:07:12,099
- Yeah, house line, cell,
nothing.

73
00:07:12,233 --> 00:07:13,534
Will you drive out there with me

74
00:07:13,668 --> 00:07:14,669
You know how she gets,
just me showing up.

75
00:07:14,802 --> 00:07:17,470
- Yeah. Fucking divorces.

76
00:07:32,687 --> 00:07:33,821
- Ho, ho, ho.

77
00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:50,604
Sara! Gabi! Grandpops.

78
00:07:54,742 --> 00:07:56,043
You don't think they
could have been overcome

79
00:07:56,177 --> 00:07:56,911
by fumes or something?

80
00:07:57,044 --> 00:07:58,212
- Arthur.

81
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:00,581
Wait out here.

82
00:08:07,221 --> 00:08:08,522
Hello?

83
00:08:13,160 --> 00:08:14,161
Sara?

84
00:08:24,005 --> 00:08:25,106
Gabi?

85
00:08:59,073 --> 00:09:01,475
- The Lord is my shepherd.

86
00:09:01,609 --> 00:09:03,010
I shall not want.

87
00:09:04,412 --> 00:09:07,948
He maketh me to lie
down in green pastures.

88
00:09:08,082 --> 00:09:11,485
He leadeth me beside
the still waters.

89
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:13,888
He restoreth my soul.

90
00:09:14,021 --> 00:09:16,190
He leadeth me in the
paths of righteousness

91
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:17,892
for his namesake.

92
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:20,594
Yea, though I walk through
the valley

93
00:09:20,728 --> 00:09:22,129
of the shadow of death,

94
00:09:22,263 --> 00:09:23,898
I will fear no evil.

95
00:09:25,866 --> 00:09:27,802
For thou art with me.

96
00:09:36,444 --> 00:09:37,878
- What's going on?

97
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:40,881
- Thinking.

98
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:57,898
- What you reading?

99
00:09:59,433 --> 00:10:01,735
Oh yeah, I read about that.

100
00:10:06,508 --> 00:10:09,910
But what are you doing sitting
all alone in the dark? Huh?

101
00:10:13,747 --> 00:10:16,884
- I breathe better in the dark.

102
00:10:17,818 --> 00:10:20,354
I don't know why. I just do.

103
00:10:28,629 --> 00:10:31,465
- A girl so young.

104
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:33,535
- Yeah. Young.

105
00:10:33,667 --> 00:10:35,703
- Jesus.

106
00:10:35,836 --> 00:10:38,339
You think she's still alive?

107
00:10:39,773 --> 00:10:41,242
- She could be.

108
00:10:46,581 --> 00:10:47,882
But if she is,

109
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:52,621
what she's going through
ain't like nothing those sheep

110
00:10:52,753 --> 00:10:55,189
in Clay could even imagine.

111
00:10:59,193 --> 00:11:01,530
- You want to go downstairs?

112
00:11:01,662 --> 00:11:04,198
We got some of those Circus
Cookies with the sprinkles.

113
00:11:04,331 --> 00:11:07,668
We could just
eat a million of them.

114
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:13,207
- I'm thinking about writing
the Sheriff's Department

115
00:11:13,340 --> 00:11:14,341
in a minute.

116
00:12:15,503 --> 00:12:16,671
- Case Hardin?

117
00:12:16,804 --> 00:12:18,640
Bob Hightower.

118
00:12:18,772 --> 00:12:19,907
- You wanna?

119
00:12:21,809 --> 00:12:23,911
- She's a
professional liar, Bob

120
00:12:24,044 --> 00:12:26,380
She was in a cult,
for Christ's sake.

121
00:12:26,514 --> 00:12:28,749
Assault with a knife,
prostitution.

122
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:31,185
conspiracy to sell heroin.

123
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:33,287
You really think this
person is trustworthy?

124
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:34,855
- She says,
she's got information.

125
00:12:34,989 --> 00:12:36,156
- Fine. Bring her in.

126
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:37,726
Sit her junkie ass
across from me.

127
00:12:37,858 --> 00:12:39,326
I'll pay the fucking Uber.
- Come on, John.

128
00:12:39,460 --> 00:12:40,595
People like that aren't
comfortable coming in here.

129
00:12:40,729 --> 00:12:41,696
- No shit, she's not comfortable

130
00:12:41,829 --> 00:12:43,097
- Please, it's been six weeks.

131
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:44,398
- Bob.
- Six weeks.

132
00:12:44,532 --> 00:12:45,700
We haven't gotten anywhere.
- Bob!

133
00:12:45,833 --> 00:12:47,001
We're doing everything we can.

134
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:48,168
I've let you take all the files

135
00:12:48,302 --> 00:12:49,537
and we run every lead, no matter

136
00:12:49,671 --> 00:12:50,605
Haven't I?

137
00:12:50,739 --> 00:12:52,273
It's the right thing to do,

138
00:12:52,406 --> 00:12:53,474
and I wouldn't have it any other
way if I was in your shoes.

139
00:12:53,608 --> 00:12:54,908
- Wait, this is a lead.

140
00:12:55,042 --> 00:12:56,210
- But this type of bitch
knows all the angles.

141
00:12:56,343 --> 00:12:57,911
And you're way out
of your league.

142
00:12:58,045 --> 00:12:59,514
Look, it'd be another thing

143
00:12:59,648 --> 00:13:01,882
if you were an experienced
investigator but.

144
00:13:02,016 --> 00:13:03,117
- But what?

145
00:13:04,586 --> 00:13:07,054
Go on, say it.

146
00:13:08,322 --> 00:13:10,257
- You're a desk cowboy, Bob.

147
00:13:10,391 --> 00:13:11,526
A seat warmer.

148
00:13:12,594 --> 00:13:15,462
I'm sorry. You want
the truth, there it is.

149
00:13:17,766 --> 00:13:18,932
- Yes, sir.

150
00:13:26,840 --> 00:13:28,942
- You want coffee?

151
00:13:29,076 --> 00:13:30,477
- Yes, thanks. Black.

152
00:13:33,380 --> 00:13:35,249
- I would offer you a beer,
but I'll be on the wagon

153
00:13:35,382 --> 00:13:38,586
for the next 40 or 50 years.

154
00:13:47,494 --> 00:13:50,598
- I believe this was
a cult murder.

155
00:13:51,666 --> 00:13:55,570
Not a robbery or any of the
crap you read in the paper.

156
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:57,605
I have photos from that night.

157
00:13:57,739 --> 00:13:58,740
You could take a look at them

158
00:13:58,872 --> 00:14:01,075
and tell me what you think.

159
00:14:02,843 --> 00:14:03,877
- Okay.

160
00:14:22,831 --> 00:14:24,766
Was Gabi into drugs?

161
00:14:24,898 --> 00:14:26,033
- No.

162
00:14:26,166 --> 00:14:27,401
- Are you sure?

163
00:14:27,535 --> 00:14:28,135
- I'm sure.

164
00:14:28,268 --> 00:14:29,937
I know my daughter.

165
00:14:31,071 --> 00:14:33,675
- Her friends into
satanic shit of any kind?

166
00:14:33,808 --> 00:14:34,942
- Satanic?

167
00:14:36,143 --> 00:14:37,512
She's 14 years old.

168
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:40,381
She look like she hangs
with that kind of crowd?

169
00:14:40,515 --> 00:14:42,483
Look, we live in a small
Christian community.

170
00:14:42,617 --> 00:14:46,755
We don't have much in the
way of deviant behavior.

171
00:14:49,691 --> 00:14:54,161
- We all came from
family-oriented communities.

172
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:55,129
Even me.

173
00:15:24,324 --> 00:15:26,960
Was this man a drug addict?

174
00:15:28,863 --> 00:15:30,964
This is a syringe mark.

175
00:15:31,498 --> 00:15:32,332
- Is it?

176
00:15:32,801 --> 00:15:34,334
What about this?

177
00:15:39,808 --> 00:15:42,176
- You're crossing over.

178
00:15:42,911 --> 00:15:43,745
- Judgement.

179
00:15:45,747 --> 00:15:47,782
The 20th enigma
of the Tarot.

180
00:15:48,583 --> 00:15:51,051
- The angel signaling...
- Judgement.

181
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:52,986
What do you know about it?

182
00:15:53,120 --> 00:15:53,954
- Was he injected
with a paralytic?

183
00:15:54,087 --> 00:15:54,889
- What do you know?

184
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,726
Case?

185
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:00,227
- No, no.
- I need to think.

186
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:01,696
- You gotta tell me
what you know.

187
00:16:01,830 --> 00:16:02,664
- No, I can't.

188
00:16:03,798 --> 00:16:04,699
- Case?

189
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:05,633
- No.

190
00:16:05,767 --> 00:16:07,067
- Case? Case, wait.

191
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:08,402
- No, please.
I just need you to go away.

192
00:16:08,536 --> 00:16:10,003
- You have to tell me
what you know.

193
00:16:10,137 --> 00:16:11,305
- You have to tell me.
- What's going on?

194
00:16:11,438 --> 00:16:12,607
- I lost my wife.
I lost my daughter.

195
00:16:12,740 --> 00:16:14,141
Tell me what you know!

196
00:16:14,274 --> 00:16:15,976
- That's enough, Mr. Hightower.

197
00:16:18,245 --> 00:16:20,748
- I'm leaving.

198
00:16:21,315 --> 00:16:22,249
- What'd you say?

199
00:16:23,785 --> 00:16:25,285
I didn't hear you.

200
00:16:26,955 --> 00:16:28,155
You're what?

201
00:16:31,291 --> 00:16:32,760
- I said, I'm leaving.

202
00:16:32,894 --> 00:16:34,261
- Oh yeah.

203
00:16:34,394 --> 00:16:36,396
That's what I, uh, that's
what I thought you said.

204
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:41,235
- No!

205
00:16:41,368 --> 00:16:43,237
Cyrus, Cyrus, she doesn't--
fucking talk about,

206
00:16:43,370 --> 00:16:45,172
- Stay out of it.

207
00:16:46,841 --> 00:16:49,611
Anyone else wanna leave?

208
00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:50,578
Huh?

209
00:16:53,982 --> 00:16:54,816
What about you, bitch?

210
00:16:54,949 --> 00:16:56,216
You want to try me again?

211
00:16:56,350 --> 00:16:58,553
I got another boot here.

212
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:05,994
- Damn!

213
00:17:13,968 --> 00:17:15,737
Let's go for a walk.

214
00:17:19,941 --> 00:17:22,109
- Cyrus, please!

215
00:17:39,326 --> 00:17:41,228
- You want to go? Then go.

216
00:17:41,361 --> 00:17:44,498
But be careful.
There ain't no turning back.

217
00:17:49,369 --> 00:17:53,608
Fuck you!

218
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:31,779
Keep it running.

219
00:18:52,900 --> 00:18:54,201
Hey, it's me.

220
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:58,806
You're not gonna shoot me,
are you?

221
00:19:00,008 --> 00:19:02,342
- I wasn't expecting anyone.

222
00:19:02,476 --> 00:19:03,878
What do you want?

223
00:19:05,580 --> 00:19:07,949
- I think I know
who took your daughter.

224
00:19:08,082 --> 00:19:10,484
and I'm betting she's alive.

225
00:19:10,618 --> 00:19:11,853
- Yeah?

226
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:12,787
- Yeah.

227
00:19:13,921 --> 00:19:16,156
The paralytic, the card.

228
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:18,092
I know this crew's handiwork.

229
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:19,259
- How?

230
00:19:19,393 --> 00:19:21,395
- Personal experience.

231
00:19:24,197 --> 00:19:25,800
I used to be one.

232
00:19:27,702 --> 00:19:30,038
- And you think Gabi's alive?

233
00:19:30,170 --> 00:19:31,204
- I do.

234
00:19:31,906 --> 00:19:32,907
- All right.

235
00:19:34,542 --> 00:19:36,309
Well, I'm gonna need
a sworn statement.

236
00:19:36,443 --> 00:19:38,278
and that means names,
descriptions

237
00:19:38,412 --> 00:19:41,749
of everyone involved.
- Slow down, Bob.

238
00:19:41,883 --> 00:19:44,317
If you think you're going to
track them down with the cops

239
00:19:44,451 --> 00:19:46,154
or even the FBI,
you can forget about it.

240
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:46,988
- Forget about it?

241
00:19:47,121 --> 00:19:48,455
- Yeah.

242
00:19:48,589 --> 00:19:51,358
These are the followers
of the Left Handed Path.

243
00:19:51,491 --> 00:19:53,326
The word of the Devil. What?

244
00:19:53,460 --> 00:19:54,829
You think you can just
write down an address

245
00:19:54,962 --> 00:19:56,931
and go round 'em up?

246
00:19:57,065 --> 00:19:59,199
You won't even get close.

247
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:00,434
And as soon as they see a bunch

248
00:20:00,568 --> 00:20:02,136
of dumb shit cops
sniffing around

249
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:04,304
the first thing Cyrus'll do is
slit your daughter's throat.

250
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:05,439
and drink her blood.
- Don't fucking say that.

251
00:20:05,573 --> 00:20:07,742
- I know that it's hard.

252
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,242
I know that.

253
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:12,580
But you gotta hear me on this,
okay?

254
00:20:13,648 --> 00:20:15,248
Forget about the authorities
tracking your daughter down.

255
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,151
It ain't gonna happen.

256
00:20:17,284 --> 00:20:18,586
If you want her back,

257
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:21,354
you gotta get her yourself.

258
00:20:21,488 --> 00:20:22,757
And lose the Boy Scout uniform.

259
00:20:22,890 --> 00:20:23,825
- All right, yeah.

260
00:20:23,958 --> 00:20:25,358
What else?

261
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:26,761
- Get as much cash as you
can and a truck that runs.

262
00:20:26,894 --> 00:20:28,129
- Yeah, I got one.

263
00:20:28,261 --> 00:20:30,798
- Okay, good, 'cause you and
me are going on the road.

264
00:20:32,200 --> 00:20:33,201
- We are?

265
00:20:33,333 --> 00:20:34,702
- Yeah, you and me, Bob.

266
00:20:34,836 --> 00:20:36,537
I'll be back bright and early.

267
00:20:36,671 --> 00:20:39,372
- I don't understand.
Where do you fit in?

268
00:20:40,775 --> 00:20:43,745
- You think that
you can do this alone?

269
00:20:43,878 --> 00:20:47,280
No offense, but you don't
send out sheep to hunt wolves.

270
00:20:58,226 --> 00:21:00,360
- We should reconsider.

271
00:21:01,495 --> 00:21:02,663
This is reckless, son.
And dangerous.

272
00:21:02,797 --> 00:21:04,431
- Just leave it alone, Arthur.

273
00:21:04,565 --> 00:21:06,100
I've made my decision.
I'll live with the consequences.

274
00:21:06,234 --> 00:21:08,435
- She's such a tramped
out excuse of a thing.

275
00:21:08,569 --> 00:21:10,037
I wouldn't put my faith in that.

276
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:12,673
- I put my faith in God.
Her, I'm traveling with.

277
00:21:12,807 --> 00:21:14,709
- How do you know
she won't sell you out?

278
00:21:14,842 --> 00:21:15,977
- I don't.

279
00:21:16,110 --> 00:21:17,245
- How do you
know she won't rob ya?

280
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:18,880
- I'm dying inside, Arthur.

281
00:21:19,013 --> 00:21:20,248
Do you understand?

282
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:22,517
A little bit every day,
but I'm dying.

283
00:21:22,650 --> 00:21:24,685
I might be stupid,
but I'm going.

284
00:21:28,756 --> 00:21:30,490
- Give me the keys, I'll drive.

285
00:21:48,776 --> 00:21:50,711
- I want you to know
something, miss.

286
00:21:50,845 --> 00:21:53,047
If anything happens to
this man over there,

287
00:21:53,181 --> 00:21:57,018
there is nothing you can say
or do to save your ass from me.

288
00:21:57,718 --> 00:21:59,187
We understand each other?

289
00:21:59,352 --> 00:22:02,489
- Absolutely. And you know what?

290
00:22:02,623 --> 00:22:04,457
I'm blown away.

291
00:22:04,592 --> 00:22:06,426
As a matter of fact,

292
00:22:06,561 --> 00:22:09,362
I'm a little wet
between my legs.

293
00:22:15,703 --> 00:22:16,504
- Be careful.

294
00:22:31,886 --> 00:22:32,954
- What?

295
00:22:33,087 --> 00:22:34,655
- Nothing.

296
00:22:34,789 --> 00:22:37,091
Just thinking, maybe if you'd
had a stronger moral compass

297
00:22:37,225 --> 00:22:38,326
as a child,

298
00:22:38,458 --> 00:22:39,827
like a religious foundation,

299
00:22:39,961 --> 00:22:42,063
that you'd possibly be
better equipped to deal

300
00:22:42,196 --> 00:22:43,297
with what happened to you.

301
00:22:43,430 --> 00:22:44,565
- You fucking kidding?

302
00:22:44,699 --> 00:22:46,200
- Well, think about it.

303
00:22:46,334 --> 00:22:49,704
- I got snatched, asshole,
just like your little girl.

304
00:22:49,837 --> 00:22:53,341
Right out from underneath my
mother's nose when I was 11.

305
00:22:53,473 --> 00:22:55,309
Ain't got nothing to do
with religion.

306
00:22:55,442 --> 00:22:56,611
- I'm sorry.

307
00:22:56,744 --> 00:22:57,645
Like I said,
I don't mean to judge.

308
00:22:57,778 --> 00:22:59,847
- Yeah, well, too late.

309
00:23:06,287 --> 00:23:07,889
- Half an hour. I mean it.

310
00:23:08,022 --> 00:23:09,924
I want her back in pretty much
the same shape I left her in.

311
00:23:10,057 --> 00:23:11,092
- Yeah. Yeah.

312
00:23:11,225 --> 00:23:12,492
You hear me?

313
00:23:12,627 --> 00:23:13,794
Don't fucking
worry about it.

314
00:23:23,771 --> 00:23:26,007
Oh, sweet Jesus.

315
00:23:26,140 --> 00:23:27,842
Come here, baby girl.

316
00:23:30,578 --> 00:23:33,681
- What's your name?
- Case.

317
00:23:33,981 --> 00:23:35,149
Case.

318
00:23:35,816 --> 00:23:39,587
Oh, you're perfect. Just perfect

319
00:23:40,254 --> 00:23:43,291
Whoo! Bubba, what you think?

320
00:23:43,423 --> 00:23:47,895
- Yeah, baby.

321
00:23:50,463 --> 00:23:53,935
Reminds me of
our own little girl.

322
00:23:58,172 --> 00:24:00,574
This is gonna be fun.

323
00:24:29,770 --> 00:24:31,806
- Hi, come here.

324
00:24:32,573 --> 00:24:36,210
Hi. Hi. Oh, gotcha.

325
00:24:37,044 --> 00:24:40,614
Yeah, they remember you.

326
00:24:40,748 --> 00:24:42,016
- Ferryman.

327
00:24:42,149 --> 00:24:43,417
- You, you gonna give them
all the love?

328
00:24:43,551 --> 00:24:44,819
Come on, now.

329
00:24:44,952 --> 00:24:47,588
Come on, now. Come on, now.

330
00:24:50,758 --> 00:24:51,959
Look at you.

331
00:24:52,994 --> 00:24:54,161
Glad to see you're amongst
the living.

332
00:24:54,295 --> 00:24:56,664
- That's me,
little miss sunshine.

333
00:24:56,797 --> 00:24:58,065
- So, who's that over there?

334
00:24:58,199 --> 00:24:59,633
- Oh, that's Bob.

335
00:24:59,767 --> 00:25:02,336
His last name's whatever
you put on his new ID.

336
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:03,804
- Okay, Mr. Bob Whatever.

337
00:25:03,938 --> 00:25:05,272
- You got that fucking
armor for me, or what?

338
00:25:05,406 --> 00:25:07,708
- I got the whole store
over there for you.

339
00:25:07,842 --> 00:25:10,311
Hey, how you doing, Robert?

340
00:25:10,444 --> 00:25:11,278
Hey.

341
00:25:13,581 --> 00:25:15,483
Should we start this ID?

342
00:25:15,616 --> 00:25:16,817
- No.

343
00:25:16,951 --> 00:25:19,954
Decal work first.
I want shit with bite.

344
00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:21,422
- With that pasty white skin,

345
00:25:21,555 --> 00:25:23,557
this ink gonna look real nice.

346
00:25:23,691 --> 00:25:24,925
- I thought we were here for gun

347
00:25:25,059 --> 00:25:26,527
You didn't say anything
about tattoos.

348
00:25:26,660 --> 00:25:27,528
- Yeah, well.

349
00:25:27,661 --> 00:25:28,729
- Yeah, well, what?

350
00:25:28,863 --> 00:25:30,131
- Bob, imagine if I showed up

351
00:25:30,264 --> 00:25:32,333
at your little church
looking like this.

352
00:25:32,466 --> 00:25:34,268
You think I'd get
a couple stares?

353
00:25:34,402 --> 00:25:35,736
Well, you're about to show up

354
00:25:35,870 --> 00:25:37,171
to a whole different type
of church, my church.

355
00:25:37,304 --> 00:25:39,407
And believe me, it's
just as bigoted as yours.

356
00:25:39,540 --> 00:25:40,875
- Why didn't you tell me before?

357
00:25:41,008 --> 00:25:42,343
- I don't like discussing
things more than once.

358
00:25:42,476 --> 00:25:43,711
- I don't like surprises.

359
00:25:43,844 --> 00:25:45,179
- Then don't be surprised
by anything.

360
00:25:45,312 --> 00:25:46,447
- Well, sorry.

361
00:25:46,580 --> 00:25:48,649
I'm not comfortable with it.

362
00:25:48,783 --> 00:25:49,984
- Okay then.

363
00:25:51,152 --> 00:25:53,320
You can just pull the plug
right now, go our separate ways.

364
00:25:53,454 --> 00:25:56,323
Last time I checked,
I was doing you a favor.

365
00:25:56,457 --> 00:25:57,825
- Hey Bee-Dub,

366
00:25:59,226 --> 00:26:00,094
you up.

367
00:26:02,696 --> 00:26:05,534
Mm-hmm, good one now.

368
00:26:05,666 --> 00:26:06,901
What you want?

369
00:26:07,034 --> 00:26:09,737
You want cursive? Hieroglyphics?

370
00:26:09,870 --> 00:26:10,738
- Just don't go crazy.

371
00:26:10,871 --> 00:26:11,705
- All right.

372
00:26:17,611 --> 00:26:19,146
- You want to get this.

373
00:26:19,280 --> 00:26:22,316
So, what do you think,
Bob Whater?

374
00:26:22,450 --> 00:26:23,651
- It's good.

375
00:26:23,784 --> 00:26:24,718
- Good?

376
00:26:24,852 --> 00:26:26,187
That's some genuine, stone cold,

377
00:26:26,320 --> 00:26:29,190
Left Handed,
black magic shit right there.

378
00:26:29,323 --> 00:26:30,624
It's perfect.

379
00:26:30,758 --> 00:26:32,927
See, you gotta understand,

380
00:26:34,128 --> 00:26:36,764
great tattoo art doesn't
come from bullshit stencils

381
00:26:36,897 --> 00:26:38,899
like you see in those
dick shop windows.

382
00:26:39,033 --> 00:26:42,937
It has to be drawn
to fit the skin.

383
00:26:43,070 --> 00:26:44,271
So the skin becomes
the flesh

384
00:26:44,405 --> 00:26:45,639
and the flesh becomes it.

385
00:26:45,773 --> 00:26:47,741
It's like a marriage.

386
00:26:47,875 --> 00:26:49,677
- Stoned motherfucker
boring you to death?

387
00:26:49,810 --> 00:26:51,712
- He's working on it.

388
00:26:51,846 --> 00:26:52,980
- Gotta use the head.
Mind if I inside?

389
00:26:53,114 --> 00:26:54,882
- You know where it is.

390
00:26:55,015 --> 00:26:56,417
What am I working on?

391
00:27:36,957 --> 00:27:39,059
- Ying, yang, yang.

392
00:27:39,193 --> 00:27:40,027
Mm-hmm.

393
00:27:41,162 --> 00:27:41,862
Okay.

394
00:27:41,996 --> 00:27:43,430
Yang's all out.

395
00:27:44,131 --> 00:27:46,267
- I robbed your refrigerator.

396
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:47,902
- Toss 'em again.

397
00:27:49,003 --> 00:27:50,671
- You're not making poor
motherfucker throw the coins,

398
00:27:50,804 --> 00:27:51,772
are you?

399
00:27:51,906 --> 00:27:52,673
- Yes, you gotta get it right.

400
00:27:52,806 --> 00:27:53,941
Come on.

401
00:27:55,409 --> 00:27:56,677
- You and your
fortune telling bullshit.

402
00:27:56,810 --> 00:27:57,978
- It's
not my bullshit.

403
00:27:58,112 --> 00:28:00,014
He's the one
who throws the coins.

404
00:28:00,147 --> 00:28:01,448
He decides his own destiny.

405
00:28:01,583 --> 00:28:03,150
I'm just here to
report the facts.

406
00:28:03,284 --> 00:28:05,520
- Mumbo jumbo fucking cha cha.
- It's not mumbo jumbo.

407
00:28:05,654 --> 00:28:07,021
It's synchronicity.

408
00:28:07,154 --> 00:28:09,423
I don't ask the questions.
I don't answer 'em.

409
00:28:09,558 --> 00:28:10,925
Time will tell us all of that.

410
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:12,893
The coins don't lie.

411
00:28:13,027 --> 00:28:14,862
- Let's just get this over with.

412
00:28:14,995 --> 00:28:16,197
- No.

413
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:20,267
Fuck that.
Give me the fucking thing.

414
00:28:20,401 --> 00:28:21,402
- What are you doing?

415
00:28:21,536 --> 00:28:22,436
- One final touch.

416
00:28:22,571 --> 00:28:23,270
- No.

417
00:28:23,404 --> 00:28:24,071
- Come on.

418
00:28:24,205 --> 00:28:25,439
- Hey, no. Not my face.

419
00:28:25,574 --> 00:28:26,273
- Please.

420
00:28:26,407 --> 00:28:27,174
- No fucking way.

421
00:28:27,308 --> 00:28:28,943
- What's the matter, Bee-Dub?

422
00:28:29,076 --> 00:28:30,978
You don't want to mess up
them school boy good looks?

423
00:28:31,111 --> 00:28:34,882
- Come on, daddy.
All my lovers have one.

424
00:28:35,716 --> 00:28:36,884
- Fuck.

425
00:28:48,862 --> 00:28:50,699
- It's time for the money.

426
00:28:50,831 --> 00:28:51,899
- 3,000.

427
00:28:53,934 --> 00:28:55,202
- It's five.

428
00:28:55,336 --> 00:28:58,439
- No. Two shotguns,
four handguns, ammo, ID.

429
00:28:58,573 --> 00:29:01,141
3,000, there's the deal.

430
00:29:01,275 --> 00:29:02,209
- He knows.

431
00:29:04,144 --> 00:29:05,614
It's okay,
I'll fucking deal with it.

432
00:29:05,746 --> 00:29:06,648
Just give me the money.

433
00:29:06,780 --> 00:29:07,616
- What if he doesn't deal?

434
00:29:07,748 --> 00:29:08,949
- Then I'll take his arm,

435
00:29:09,083 --> 00:29:10,084
start killing the dogs
one at a time,

436
00:29:10,217 --> 00:29:12,920
just give me the fucking money.

437
00:29:15,657 --> 00:29:16,991
Wait here, okay?

438
00:29:32,373 --> 00:29:36,443
- Let's put this chit-chat
in perspective.

439
00:29:36,578 --> 00:29:38,412
What's with the sheep?

440
00:29:39,246 --> 00:29:42,182
- Let's see
if this math adds up.

441
00:29:43,784 --> 00:29:47,388
One plus one equals Cyrus.

442
00:29:47,988 --> 00:29:49,256
- Oh fuck.

443
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:52,026
- 12-24-20,
right there in your handiwork.

444
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:53,695
- Look, I swear to God,
I don't give a shit.

445
00:29:53,827 --> 00:29:55,229
But what you doing?

446
00:29:55,362 --> 00:29:56,564
You was on your way to
clearing your own shit up.

447
00:29:56,698 --> 00:29:58,633
Why this? You got a death wish?

448
00:29:58,767 --> 00:30:01,703
Huh? Is that what you got?
'Cause they'll give it to you.

449
00:30:02,570 --> 00:30:04,338
You out. Leave it alone.
Screw the sheep.

450
00:30:05,674 --> 00:30:07,007
Cyrus too. He's a sheep.

451
00:30:07,141 --> 00:30:09,544
Different breed, but he's
a motherfucking sheep.

452
00:30:09,678 --> 00:30:11,045
Leave it.

453
00:30:11,178 --> 00:30:12,647
I thought you gave that
whole bad boy shit up

454
00:30:12,781 --> 00:30:14,481
when you split, but now this?

455
00:30:14,616 --> 00:30:15,949
Let me tell you something, Case.

456
00:30:16,083 --> 00:30:18,620
They will leave your ass behind.

457
00:30:18,753 --> 00:30:19,920
- Where is he?

458
00:30:25,859 --> 00:30:28,062
- They're on rat patrol.

459
00:30:28,195 --> 00:30:29,531
- And the girl?

460
00:30:29,664 --> 00:30:30,732
She with him?

461
00:30:30,864 --> 00:30:32,333
- She with him.

462
00:30:37,404 --> 00:30:38,740
Who's the sheep?

463
00:30:38,872 --> 00:30:39,907
- Interested third party.

464
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:41,075
- How interested?

465
00:30:41,208 --> 00:30:43,177
- Blood and bones, baby doll.

466
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:46,013
It's all crossing overtime now.

467
00:30:46,146 --> 00:30:48,048
- Bob, I'm glad
you could join us.

468
00:30:48,182 --> 00:30:51,151
We were just discussing
philosophies.

469
00:30:51,285 --> 00:30:53,887
See, my take on things is,
is that

470
00:30:54,021 --> 00:30:57,091
selfishness is
the key to survival.

471
00:30:59,093 --> 00:31:01,395
What you think, Bob Whatever?

472
00:31:01,529 --> 00:31:03,765
- I think you don't give
a shit what I think.

473
00:31:03,897 --> 00:31:05,099
We all done?

474
00:31:07,769 --> 00:31:08,936
Well?

475
00:31:13,742 --> 00:31:15,943
- She was alive two weeks ago.

476
00:31:44,471 --> 00:31:47,575
- Hello, darling. New videos?

477
00:31:48,041 --> 00:31:49,376
- Fuck you.

478
00:31:49,511 --> 00:31:53,414
- "How was your day, Maureen?"
Fine, just tired.

479
00:31:54,114 --> 00:31:55,282
I had drinks with Emerald,

480
00:31:55,416 --> 00:31:57,619
she thinks Alan might be
having an affair.

481
00:31:57,752 --> 00:32:01,723
Also saw to Arthur.
Said Bob's taken off.

482
00:32:02,389 --> 00:32:03,825
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

483
00:32:03,957 --> 00:32:06,761
Packed a bag and hit the road.

484
00:32:06,895 --> 00:32:08,462
Seems he's on to something.

485
00:32:08,596 --> 00:32:11,331
- I doubt it.
Bob's a fucking idiot.

486
00:32:12,466 --> 00:32:15,637
Oh, really? As defined by whom?

487
00:32:16,671 --> 00:32:18,138
You?

488
00:32:18,272 --> 00:32:21,609
Is it true you offered him a job
managing the development?

489
00:32:21,743 --> 00:32:24,712
- He needed a change.
Arthur felt the same.

490
00:32:25,580 --> 00:32:26,748
- Don't consult me or anything.

491
00:32:26,881 --> 00:32:27,715
- Consult you?
- Yeah.

492
00:32:27,849 --> 00:32:29,283
The man works for me, Mo.

493
00:32:29,416 --> 00:32:31,118
Just de-ball me at every turn.

494
00:32:31,251 --> 00:32:34,288
- Oh, God. Pass me the ice
and gin shaker thingy.

495
00:32:34,421 --> 00:32:36,724
Because I need a few close frien
inside me.

496
00:32:36,858 --> 00:32:39,561
- Be your own fucking bartender.

497
00:32:44,064 --> 00:32:46,400
- You know, John.

498
00:32:47,802 --> 00:32:51,104
When I first met you,
I knew you were weak,

499
00:32:51,840 --> 00:32:54,374
but found you modestly charming.

500
00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:57,645
But like polish on cheap shoes,

501
00:32:58,713 --> 00:33:01,783
that charm scuffed off and
left you as you really are.

502
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:02,917
Limp.

503
00:33:03,050 --> 00:33:05,687
- Have another drink.

504
00:33:06,654 --> 00:33:08,455
- I didn't mind it so much
when I was younger.

505
00:33:08,590 --> 00:33:11,458
There was something docile
and sweet about it.

506
00:33:12,527 --> 00:33:14,194
For a while, I actually thought
you were sensitive.

507
00:33:14,328 --> 00:33:17,765
And that weakness kind of
brought out the mother in me,

508
00:33:18,766 --> 00:33:20,735
and at night, it gave me
the opportunity to be on top,

509
00:33:21,401 --> 00:33:22,670
put the strap-on to you.

510
00:33:22,804 --> 00:33:24,438
You remember how you used to
love that, baby?

511
00:33:24,572 --> 00:33:26,541
- Wow. You're really putting it
out there tonight.

512
00:33:26,674 --> 00:33:28,242
- I'm looking to bat
three for four, baby.

513
00:33:28,375 --> 00:33:30,845
- You know, I'd watch
my mouth if I were you,

514
00:33:30,979 --> 00:33:32,112
I'm in no mood tonight.

515
00:33:32,246 --> 00:33:34,582
- What are you going to do,
fuck me?

516
00:33:34,716 --> 00:33:36,718
You'd have to get your
little dick hard first.

517
00:33:36,851 --> 00:33:38,586
- Say what you want, Mo,

518
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:40,120
but you're not going to
humiliate me

519
00:33:40,254 --> 00:33:42,122
like you did with Sammy boy.

520
00:33:42,256 --> 00:33:43,558
- What does that mean?

521
00:33:43,691 --> 00:33:46,761
- It means I'd better be careful
if I were you.

522
00:33:47,762 --> 00:33:49,396
You might get your own personal
Jack the Ripper

523
00:33:49,531 --> 00:33:51,398
slitting that saggy neck of your

524
00:33:51,533 --> 00:33:53,801
- Fuck you.
- Fuck you!

525
00:33:54,903 --> 00:33:56,303
Fuck you! Why don't you go back
in your little study

526
00:33:56,436 --> 00:33:57,639
and jerk off,
you fucking pervert?!

527
00:33:57,772 --> 00:33:59,641
- At least I don't bring
my humps home

528
00:33:59,774 --> 00:34:01,576
in brown paper bags.

529
00:34:01,709 --> 00:34:04,746
Watch little boys suck
on their little dicks.

530
00:34:10,317 --> 00:34:12,754
Come on, sweetheart.
Nothing to say now, huh?

531
00:34:15,255 --> 00:34:18,026
- Oh, my God!
You're such a pussy!

532
00:35:00,467 --> 00:35:02,837
- Tell me about Cyrus.
I want to get a read on him.

533
00:35:02,971 --> 00:35:04,371
Well, what's his story?

534
00:35:04,505 --> 00:35:05,807
- His story?
- Yeah.

535
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:07,609
What?
You got someplace else to be?

536
00:35:07,742 --> 00:35:11,345
I mean, we're stuck in
this fucking car for hours.

537
00:35:14,414 --> 00:35:17,619
- Really fucked up as a kid,
bad junkie,

538
00:35:17,752 --> 00:35:22,155
thief, prostitute, sold his
ass to pay for his bad habit,

539
00:35:22,289 --> 00:35:24,692
that sort of shit.

540
00:35:24,826 --> 00:35:25,827
But then...

541
00:35:25,960 --> 00:35:27,361
- But what?

542
00:35:27,494 --> 00:35:30,098
- Somewhere along the
line, something changed.

543
00:35:31,866 --> 00:35:33,333
I don't know the reason.

544
00:35:33,467 --> 00:35:35,135
But whatever it was, he
found the Left Handed Path,

545
00:35:35,268 --> 00:35:36,904
and that was it.

546
00:35:37,038 --> 00:35:42,442
It anchored him, like those
freaks that find Jesus.

547
00:35:42,844 --> 00:35:43,945
- Excuse me.

548
00:35:44,078 --> 00:35:45,513
My ex-wife was butchered
by this piece of shit.

549
00:35:45,647 --> 00:35:46,948
So if you wouldn't mind
not comparing

550
00:35:47,081 --> 00:35:49,651
his satanical bullshit
to someone believing

551
00:35:49,784 --> 00:35:50,818
in Jesus Christ.
- Hey, you asked.

552
00:35:50,952 --> 00:35:51,919
Pick your fucking poison.

553
00:35:52,053 --> 00:35:53,855
- No. Religion isn't secular.

554
00:35:53,988 --> 00:35:55,590
It's pure.

555
00:35:55,723 --> 00:35:57,324
It's the unmoved truth that
all principles spin out from.

556
00:35:57,457 --> 00:35:59,927
- Ooh, you're a real clit
dryer, Bob. You know that?

557
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:02,429
- That motherfucker cooked your
head pretty good, didn't he?

558
00:36:02,563 --> 00:36:03,598
- I wouldn't use the word pretty

559
00:36:03,731 --> 00:36:04,999
and I wouldn't use the word good

560
00:36:05,133 --> 00:36:07,234
- Not give a fuck about you.

561
00:36:07,367 --> 00:36:09,403
Cleaned up his act, kept
all his troops junkies.

562
00:36:09,537 --> 00:36:11,105
- No, the truth's much worse.

563
00:36:11,238 --> 00:36:12,439
- Yeah?

564
00:36:12,573 --> 00:36:13,574
- Once upon a time,

565
00:36:13,708 --> 00:36:16,611
I was a disease just waiting to

566
00:36:16,744 --> 00:36:19,647
I found a ringmaster
with a magic needle.

567
00:36:19,781 --> 00:36:22,884
And I bowed before that needle.

568
00:36:23,017 --> 00:36:24,952
When I got low enough,

569
00:36:25,086 --> 00:36:27,487
I made a God out of it.

570
00:36:27,622 --> 00:36:29,791
The Devil's only an idea, Bob,

571
00:36:29,924 --> 00:36:33,861
an excuse for evil, just as
your God is an excuse for good.

572
00:36:33,995 --> 00:36:35,495
They're concepts.

573
00:36:35,630 --> 00:36:37,732
They're the needles just waiting
for people like you and me

574
00:36:37,865 --> 00:36:39,000
to stick 'em in.

575
00:36:39,734 --> 00:36:41,803
- That's real deep. I mean, wow.

576
00:36:41,936 --> 00:36:44,072
You know what?
I'll tell you what.

577
00:36:44,204 --> 00:36:45,506
I'll keep my faith.

578
00:36:45,640 --> 00:36:46,974
You can keep the rest

579
00:36:47,108 --> 00:36:50,343
of whatever the fuck it
is you're talking about.

580
00:37:34,421 --> 00:37:37,024
<i>Gracias.</i>

581
00:37:47,969 --> 00:37:50,838
- What made you
finally decide to leave?

582
00:37:50,972 --> 00:37:53,608
Cyrus, the group? I mean,
what made you take off?

583
00:39:24,866 --> 00:39:25,900
- Mama?

584
00:39:26,033 --> 00:39:28,069
- Stop! What?

585
00:39:28,202 --> 00:39:29,837
Why are you following me?

586
00:39:29,971 --> 00:39:31,339
- Hey!

587
00:39:31,471 --> 00:39:34,675
Hey! You mind your fucking
business, you fat fucking cunt!

588
00:39:34,809 --> 00:39:36,811
I'll slit your fucking throat.

589
00:39:47,521 --> 00:39:49,456
- A woman in a store.

590
00:39:51,292 --> 00:39:52,392
So stupid.

591
00:39:52,526 --> 00:39:54,829
Didn't even look like her.

592
00:39:54,962 --> 00:39:56,496
I don't even know
what I would've done

593
00:39:56,631 --> 00:40:00,400
if it was actually her
or what I woulda said.

594
00:40:01,468 --> 00:40:04,205
Hey, mom. How's it going?

595
00:40:04,338 --> 00:40:07,842
How have the last dozen
fucking years been?

596
00:40:07,975 --> 00:40:10,244
Maybe I would have asked what
I was like when I was younger

597
00:40:10,378 --> 00:40:12,980
because I don't fucking remember

598
00:40:13,114 --> 00:40:16,317
or you know,
when she stopped looking,

599
00:40:16,449 --> 00:40:18,853
like, what the fuck happened?

600
00:40:21,589 --> 00:40:23,324
- You ever find out
what happened to her?

601
00:40:23,456 --> 00:40:24,859
Does she even know you're alive?

602
00:40:24,992 --> 00:40:26,193
- No.

603
00:40:26,327 --> 00:40:28,495
I don't know. I don't even
know if I want her to.

604
00:40:28,629 --> 00:40:29,597
- Well, why not?

605
00:40:29,730 --> 00:40:31,498
- Because I don't. All right?

606
00:40:31,632 --> 00:40:33,634
It's been a dozen fucking years.

607
00:40:33,768 --> 00:40:34,568
And what's with all the question

608
00:40:34,702 --> 00:40:35,703
- Okay, okay.

609
00:40:35,836 --> 00:40:37,204
Mind your own fucking business.

610
00:40:37,338 --> 00:40:40,007
- Can we get the check, please?

611
00:40:58,359 --> 00:40:59,961
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

612
00:41:00,795 --> 00:41:03,130
The prodigal daughter returns.

613
00:41:03,264 --> 00:41:05,633
And who's this? A new
member of the family?

614
00:41:05,766 --> 00:41:06,567
- This is Bob.

615
00:41:06,701 --> 00:41:08,501
Bob, this is Errol.

616
00:41:08,636 --> 00:41:11,939
- What are you doing here,
headcase?

617
00:41:12,073 --> 00:41:15,109
- Well, we were having dinner
in Nogales,

618
00:41:15,242 --> 00:41:16,711
and I remembered your bar.

619
00:41:16,844 --> 00:41:20,514
So I thought, why not
come by and say hello?

620
00:41:23,417 --> 00:41:26,053
- Oh, dear, dear, dear.

621
00:41:26,954 --> 00:41:29,991
I'm glad to see
you couldn't make it.

622
00:41:31,826 --> 00:41:33,828
- I'm leaving.

623
00:41:33,961 --> 00:41:34,862
- Right?

624
00:41:38,833 --> 00:41:41,702
- Hey! Hey!

625
00:41:42,103 --> 00:41:43,871
Bob! Bob, stop.

626
00:41:44,005 --> 00:41:45,673
- Fucking piece of work,
you know that?

627
00:41:45,806 --> 00:41:46,674
- Bet your ass.

628
00:41:46,807 --> 00:41:47,808
- Clean and sober, huh?

629
00:41:47,942 --> 00:41:49,343
When'd you start using?

630
00:41:49,477 --> 00:41:51,445
- When did I start keeping
my sleeves down, huh?

631
00:41:51,579 --> 00:41:52,713
- I don't give a shit.

632
00:41:52,847 --> 00:41:53,714
- You don't fucking know.
Do you?

633
00:41:53,848 --> 00:41:55,182
- Leave me alone.

634
00:41:55,316 --> 00:41:56,517
Just shut up. Shut up.
- 100 fucking degrees

635
00:41:56,650 --> 00:41:58,019
in that shit locker restaurant,

636
00:41:58,152 --> 00:41:59,687
I've got my sleeves tucked
in my fucking hands.

637
00:41:59,820 --> 00:42:01,088
Fucking stooge.

638
00:42:02,723 --> 00:42:05,026
You want to fucking know
what's going on, huh?

639
00:42:07,528 --> 00:42:09,663
Fucking listen and learn,
desk boy.

640
00:42:09,797 --> 00:42:11,132
- Don't fucking...

641
00:42:13,501 --> 00:42:16,137
- Powder? Vitamin C.

642
00:42:17,171 --> 00:42:18,639
Liquid cleaner.

643
00:42:25,479 --> 00:42:27,548
Looks bad, scabs up nice.

644
00:42:27,681 --> 00:42:29,950
No one but a fucking moron
would believe that I'm a shooter

645
00:42:30,084 --> 00:42:32,386
without checking me out first,

646
00:42:32,521 --> 00:42:33,454
especially with an albatross

647
00:42:33,587 --> 00:42:36,090
like you hanging around my neck.

648
00:42:37,491 --> 00:42:38,325
Happy?

649
00:42:40,061 --> 00:42:41,796
- You don't trust me? We're
supposed to be a fucking team.

650
00:42:41,929 --> 00:42:44,298
- Not a team. I'm the one
who's finding your daughter.

651
00:42:44,432 --> 00:42:45,733
You don't need to know shit.

652
00:42:45,866 --> 00:42:47,601
Better off staying stupid.

653
00:42:47,735 --> 00:42:49,336
- Perfect.

654
00:43:07,321 --> 00:43:08,456
Listen.

655
00:43:08,622 --> 00:43:09,790
- Forget it, Bob.

656
00:43:09,924 --> 00:43:12,093
You're strictly
the missionary position.

657
00:43:12,226 --> 00:43:14,195
- You lie to me to get me
to react a certain way.

658
00:43:14,328 --> 00:43:16,797
The missionary position and
not a trick more.

659
00:43:16,931 --> 00:43:18,833
Is that a slogan
or just pure venom?

660
00:43:19,534 --> 00:43:20,835
'Cause the last time I looked,

661
00:43:20,968 --> 00:43:21,902
- Last time you looked
would just be that,

662
00:43:22,036 --> 00:43:22,870
the last time you fucking looked

663
00:43:23,003 --> 00:43:24,539
- I'm looking at you!

664
00:43:24,672 --> 00:43:27,975
The banality of your cheap
whore tricks, the lies.

665
00:43:28,109 --> 00:43:29,376
Fuck you!

666
00:43:29,511 --> 00:43:30,911
No, you don't fucking fool me.
You think you fool me?

667
00:43:31,045 --> 00:43:31,979
I know why you're here.

668
00:43:32,113 --> 00:43:33,314
I'm gonna help him get her back,

669
00:43:33,447 --> 00:43:35,449
otherwise,
if we would get too close,

670
00:43:35,584 --> 00:43:36,984
Cyrus'll kill her quick.

671
00:43:37,118 --> 00:43:39,820
What? You think your
therapist wouldn't tell me?

672
00:43:39,954 --> 00:43:41,755
- I did say that.

673
00:43:43,525 --> 00:43:44,892
I just thought,

674
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:47,261
if she had to go through
what I did.

675
00:43:47,394 --> 00:43:49,263
- Don't. Just save it.

676
00:43:50,431 --> 00:43:52,633
I can imagine it all.

677
00:43:59,907 --> 00:44:02,643
- Errol said Cyrus is coming.

678
00:44:05,547 --> 00:44:06,347
- When?

679
00:44:07,982 --> 00:44:09,917
- A few days, a week,

680
00:44:11,185 --> 00:44:14,388
he doesn't know, but he's coming

681
00:44:14,523 --> 00:44:19,326
And Errol's gonna arrange
a little homecoming for me.

682
00:44:37,678 --> 00:44:40,848
- Jesus Christ, what happened?

683
00:44:46,954 --> 00:44:49,757
I'm so sorry, Mo.

684
00:44:49,890 --> 00:44:51,225
- Don't be.

685
00:44:51,358 --> 00:44:53,727
Look, I have to
tell you something.

686
00:44:55,664 --> 00:44:57,998
- Oh, yeah!

687
00:44:58,866 --> 00:45:00,334
I had an affair with Sam.

688
00:45:00,467 --> 00:45:03,304
John Lee knew about it.
I don't know how.

689
00:45:03,437 --> 00:45:06,207
But he threatened to kill me
if it ever happened again.

690
00:45:06,340 --> 00:45:08,909
- You slept with
my baby's husband?

691
00:45:09,043 --> 00:45:10,512
How could you?

692
00:45:10,645 --> 00:45:13,714
- I didn't sleep with him
because he was her husband.

693
00:45:14,549 --> 00:45:16,750
Look, he was young,
he was willing.

694
00:45:16,884 --> 00:45:18,620
He was everything
John Lee hated, okay?

695
00:45:18,752 --> 00:45:20,888
It was stupid.

696
00:45:21,523 --> 00:45:23,490
Arthur. Listen to me.

697
00:45:23,625 --> 00:45:25,926
I don't think
John Lee wants to find out

698
00:45:26,060 --> 00:45:28,395
who killed Sara and Sam.

699
00:45:50,351 --> 00:45:54,488
- I'm going. Can't stand
this room any longer.

700
00:46:04,532 --> 00:46:05,700
Where's Errol?

701
00:46:05,833 --> 00:46:06,934
<i>No se.</i>

702
00:46:07,835 --> 00:46:09,937
Maybe still at Maquila.

703
00:46:10,771 --> 00:46:12,239
- Tequila, please.

704
00:46:26,253 --> 00:46:28,922
- Nice fucking artwork, man.

705
00:46:30,891 --> 00:46:32,192
I mean it.

706
00:46:32,326 --> 00:46:35,664
Fucking deluxe shit
you got there.

707
00:46:35,796 --> 00:46:36,930
- Thanks.

708
00:46:43,804 --> 00:46:45,540
- What the fuck, man?

709
00:46:45,674 --> 00:46:48,842
Gutter's waiting. Time to move.

710
00:47:08,362 --> 00:47:09,930
Hey!

711
00:47:29,116 --> 00:47:30,951
- Hey!

712
00:47:39,226 --> 00:47:41,563
- Granny...
- Mm?

713
00:47:42,764 --> 00:47:45,032
that doorstop in the lobby.

714
00:47:45,165 --> 00:47:47,736
With the decal work.
What was up with that?

715
00:47:47,868 --> 00:47:49,937
- Which one?
- What do you mean?

716
00:47:50,070 --> 00:47:51,573
- That piece on his face.

717
00:47:51,706 --> 00:47:54,709
It didn't look
a little weird to you?

718
00:47:54,843 --> 00:47:56,778
- Weird how?

719
00:47:56,910 --> 00:47:59,146
- It's the same mark as Lena.
Come on.

720
00:47:59,279 --> 00:48:02,416
Get your fucking head out of
paper bags, prince.

721
00:48:03,083 --> 00:48:04,586
That's Lena's girlfriend's mark.

722
00:48:04,719 --> 00:48:07,655
Now it's on some doorstop's face
in the middle of Shitville

723
00:48:08,723 --> 00:48:11,959
six months later,
that's pretty fucking Gothic.

724
00:48:12,727 --> 00:48:14,829
- Not gothic. She's here.

725
00:48:14,962 --> 00:48:16,997
I just ran into her by accident.

726
00:48:17,131 --> 00:48:19,400
- Who?
- Headcase.

727
00:48:20,100 --> 00:48:23,270
You just blew off her old man.

728
00:48:23,838 --> 00:48:26,440
You saw fucking Case?

729
00:48:31,178 --> 00:48:33,947
You saw fucking Case?

730
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:48,696
You're telling me
that freakshow back there

731
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:50,665
is Case's old man?

732
00:48:50,799 --> 00:48:51,833
- Yes.

733
00:48:51,965 --> 00:48:54,301
Case says he's been her Platinum

734
00:48:54,435 --> 00:48:56,771
but now she's looking
for a re-union.

735
00:48:56,905 --> 00:48:59,940
- With Cyrus? No.

736
00:49:00,809 --> 00:49:02,409
She is not one of us.

737
00:49:02,544 --> 00:49:05,479
There is nothing coincidental
about anything she does.

738
00:49:05,613 --> 00:49:07,715
That Yoko bitch would
eat her own young.

739
00:49:07,849 --> 00:49:09,283
- That's pretty gothic, huh?

740
00:49:09,416 --> 00:49:11,786
Cinderella returning,
knocking on the door.

741
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:13,721
- What'd you tell him, Errol?

742
00:49:13,855 --> 00:49:15,523
- Nothing. She was junked out.

743
00:49:15,657 --> 00:49:17,559
She's just looking for
a little bit of dope,

744
00:49:17,692 --> 00:49:19,126
that's all.

745
00:49:19,259 --> 00:49:20,461
- What are you doing
talking to strangers, anyway?

746
00:49:20,595 --> 00:49:23,598
- It was a coincidence.
- A coincidence?

747
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,837
- You know what?

748
00:49:28,969 --> 00:49:31,171
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you.

749
00:49:31,305 --> 00:49:33,675
I don't answer to you.
I don't answer to fucking Cyrus.

750
00:49:33,808 --> 00:49:36,578
And I'm not gonna stand here
in this motherfucking river

751
00:49:36,711 --> 00:49:39,647
While you two idiots try to come
with a coherent fucking thought!

752
00:49:39,781 --> 00:49:44,251
It's fucking Case!
She wants to come back home.

753
00:49:45,219 --> 00:49:46,955
And I personally don't give
two fucks

754
00:49:47,087 --> 00:49:49,089
if Cyrus sees her or not.

755
00:49:49,223 --> 00:49:52,392
I just figured
he'd want to bleed the bitch.

756
00:50:10,010 --> 00:50:12,312
- He's close, isn't he?

757
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,717
- Fucking black magic.

758
00:50:21,421 --> 00:50:23,056
If they cross, we're fucked.

759
00:50:23,190 --> 00:50:25,192
- We're fucked,
but we're crossing.

760
00:50:30,899 --> 00:50:32,065
- What about the guns?

761
00:50:32,199 --> 00:50:33,768
- Don't
worry about it. Go.

762
00:51:26,219 --> 00:51:28,523
- Hello, sheep.

763
00:52:34,589 --> 00:52:36,323
- Headcase wanted me to tell you

764
00:52:36,456 --> 00:52:38,258
she's doing a little night-skyin

765
00:52:38,392 --> 00:52:40,160
- Where is she?

766
00:52:40,293 --> 00:52:43,463
- Over the hills and
through the woods...

767
00:52:44,431 --> 00:52:46,768
Really shouldn't be
following us, man.

768
00:52:47,669 --> 00:52:49,169
It don't look too hot
on your resume.

769
00:52:49,302 --> 00:52:51,438
- If she's blowing me off,
I want to hear it from her.

770
00:52:51,572 --> 00:52:54,408
- Sorry,
no pre-recorded messages.

771
00:52:57,078 --> 00:52:59,246
Judgement.

772
00:53:08,790 --> 00:53:11,826
- If something happens to her,
I swear to God.

773
00:53:11,959 --> 00:53:13,628
You hear me?!

774
00:53:13,761 --> 00:53:16,798
- Go back, Bob.
- Case?

775
00:53:16,931 --> 00:53:19,667
- Go back, it's over.

776
00:53:20,635 --> 00:53:22,804
- Where are you?
- Go fucking back!

777
00:54:25,099 --> 00:54:26,801
- Well, well.

778
00:54:26,934 --> 00:54:27,835
Hello.

779
00:54:30,738 --> 00:54:31,839
- I want to come home.

780
00:54:43,251 --> 00:54:43,985
- What?

781
00:54:45,452 --> 00:54:47,922
You said you wanted
a little blood.

782
00:55:12,213 --> 00:55:13,014
- Okay.

783
00:56:26,453 --> 00:56:27,487
It's okay.

784
00:56:47,074 --> 00:56:51,112
- We all wanna come home
in the end, don't we?

785
00:56:54,849 --> 00:56:57,718
But how much is it worth to you?

786
00:56:59,754 --> 00:57:01,856
- It's worth everything.

787
00:57:04,058 --> 00:57:05,425
- Good answer.

788
00:57:10,398 --> 00:57:11,866
Okay, load her up.

789
00:57:37,558 --> 00:57:39,627
That's my girl.

790
00:57:47,068 --> 00:57:51,105
You know what the real
equalizers in life are?

791
00:57:52,472 --> 00:57:54,141
Suffering and death.

792
00:57:55,042 --> 00:57:56,744
Everything else is daycare.

793
00:57:56,877 --> 00:57:59,347
But suffering and death?

794
00:57:59,479 --> 00:58:00,681
They lay it out pretty fast

795
00:58:00,815 --> 00:58:03,851
when it comes to
who you really are.

796
00:58:06,988 --> 00:58:10,858
How do I know
I can trust you coming home?

797
00:58:12,093 --> 00:58:15,863
How do I know you're
not trying to fuck me?

798
00:58:20,301 --> 00:58:23,471
Maybe you don't love me anymore.

799
00:58:23,604 --> 00:58:25,072
You bring a pistol?

800
00:58:25,206 --> 00:58:29,377
Maybe you wanna punch a
few holes in the messenger.

801
00:58:29,510 --> 00:58:30,544
- No.

802
00:58:32,813 --> 00:58:33,814
- I don't know.

803
00:58:33,948 --> 00:58:36,450
People play all sorts of games.

804
00:58:37,718 --> 00:58:39,487
Know what I mean, Errol?

805
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:40,688
- What?

806
00:58:40,821 --> 00:58:44,125
- You like games.
Don't ya, chief?

807
00:58:44,258 --> 00:58:46,861
- Uh.

808
00:58:47,828 --> 00:58:49,296
Yeah, I don't know.

809
00:58:49,430 --> 00:58:50,731
I don't even know what the
fuck you're talking about.

810
00:58:50,865 --> 00:58:53,467
- Sure you do, Mr. Firewater,

811
00:58:54,535 --> 00:58:57,038
Mr. Fucking Yuppie Redskin
Phony who changed his name

812
00:58:57,171 --> 00:58:59,206
so nobody would know
he was a piece of shit

813
00:58:59,340 --> 00:59:01,742
from the reservation.

814
00:59:01,876 --> 00:59:05,780
I mean, I'm Cherokee,
but what the fuck?

815
00:59:05,913 --> 00:59:07,615
- How do I know you
and the dead one aren't

816
00:59:07,748 --> 00:59:08,983
in this together?

817
00:59:09,116 --> 00:59:10,151
- Come on.

818
00:59:10,284 --> 00:59:11,819
- How do I know?!

819
00:59:15,756 --> 00:59:19,326
- I'm not buying into this shit.

820
00:59:21,862 --> 00:59:23,831
God damn it.

821
00:59:24,999 --> 00:59:27,268
You don't even fucking
believe what you're saying.

822
00:59:27,401 --> 00:59:28,235
Huh?

823
00:59:30,738 --> 00:59:34,575
And I don't travel
with protection.

824
00:59:34,708 --> 00:59:37,711
I don't need a fucking weapon.

825
00:59:37,845 --> 00:59:39,847
I don't scam anybody.

826
00:59:39,980 --> 00:59:42,483
I don't screw anybody.

827
00:59:42,616 --> 00:59:44,952
And if I did,

828
00:59:45,086 --> 00:59:48,656
would I use fucking headcase?

829
00:59:48,789 --> 00:59:50,024
Fucking, oh no!

830
00:59:51,859 --> 00:59:53,928
Jesus Christ!

831
00:59:54,829 --> 00:59:56,897
This isn't fucking funny, man.

832
00:59:57,031 --> 00:59:58,432
Oh fuck.

833
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:00,234
- It's time you wore your death

834
01:00:00,367 --> 01:00:01,802
- The fuck
are you doing?

835
01:00:01,936 --> 01:00:04,038
Shit! The fuck!

836
01:00:05,706 --> 01:00:07,374
Jesus Christ!

837
01:00:08,976 --> 01:00:10,344
- Put on some music.

838
01:00:10,478 --> 01:00:13,582
- Music? Cyrus,
I'm your fucking partner!

839
01:00:13,714 --> 01:00:15,082
You don't get it.

840
01:00:15,216 --> 01:00:17,751
- Louder! Yeah.
- Cyrus, I'm your fucking boy.

841
01:00:17,885 --> 01:00:20,955
What the fuck the is this?
- Yeah, that's it.

842
01:00:21,088 --> 01:00:25,192
We need blood to preserve
the youth of America.

843
01:00:27,695 --> 01:00:29,263
Go to it, sister.

844
01:01:00,828 --> 01:01:01,896
- This is not funny!

845
01:01:02,029 --> 01:01:03,898
This is not a fucking joke!

846
01:01:10,639 --> 01:01:13,307
- No, no, no, no, no!

847
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:15,342
Oh my God!

848
01:01:15,476 --> 01:01:16,511
Fuck!

849
01:01:31,058 --> 01:01:34,895
- Shoot him! Shoot him!

850
01:01:38,866 --> 01:01:41,168
- What the fuck?!

851
01:01:54,315 --> 01:01:56,917
Fuck! No! No!

852
01:02:13,100 --> 01:02:18,072
- Mujer blanco?
Have you seen mujer blanco?

853
01:02:18,205 --> 01:02:20,709
No? Hey.

854
01:02:20,841 --> 01:02:22,677
Mujer blanco?

855
01:02:22,810 --> 01:02:25,379
Hey! Mujer blanco.

856
01:02:33,053 --> 01:02:34,788
Mujer blanco?

857
01:02:34,922 --> 01:02:36,691
- No? You're wearing
her fucking jacket.

858
01:02:36,824 --> 01:02:38,526
Where is she? Where?

859
01:02:38,660 --> 01:02:39,760
Away we go.

860
01:02:41,730 --> 01:02:43,497
Where?

861
01:03:48,996 --> 01:03:49,764
- Get off her.

862
01:03:49,897 --> 01:03:51,533
Sit the fuck down!

863
01:03:52,801 --> 01:03:54,435
What do you want?

864
01:03:59,507 --> 01:04:00,474
Case?

865
01:04:00,608 --> 01:04:02,843
Case, can you stand up?

866
01:04:02,976 --> 01:04:04,144
We need to get outta here.

867
01:04:04,278 --> 01:04:05,580
Put your arms around me.

868
01:04:29,203 --> 01:04:30,739
- No, I don't.

869
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:34,542
Come on, man.

870
01:05:01,935 --> 01:05:03,404
- Okay.

871
01:05:24,893 --> 01:05:26,960
- You gotta pull over.

872
01:05:28,295 --> 01:05:31,064
I gotta visit some old witches.

873
01:05:52,286 --> 01:05:54,955
Yeah, fuck me is right.

874
01:05:59,092 --> 01:06:00,662
- You all right?

875
01:06:10,204 --> 01:06:11,405
- I had him.

876
01:06:13,207 --> 01:06:14,975
I fucking had him.

877
01:06:16,678 --> 01:06:19,747
I shoulda killed him
when I had the chance.

878
01:06:19,881 --> 01:06:21,448
- Don't worry about it.

879
01:06:22,584 --> 01:06:25,753
Wouldn't get us
where we need to go.

880
01:06:27,689 --> 01:06:28,556
Come on.

881
01:06:52,647 --> 01:06:56,016
We're not gonna find him here,
are we?

882
01:06:58,018 --> 01:06:59,052
- No.

883
01:07:00,087 --> 01:07:02,590
But he's going to
the Mojave next.

884
01:07:06,426 --> 01:07:09,664
- Last night,
when I was looking for you,

885
01:07:09,797 --> 01:07:10,965
no one spoke English.

886
01:07:11,098 --> 01:07:14,101
I couldn't understand anyone.

887
01:07:15,837 --> 01:07:18,238
For some reason,

888
01:07:18,372 --> 01:07:21,108
Sam came to my mind.

889
01:07:21,609 --> 01:07:22,442
- Who?

890
01:07:23,243 --> 01:07:25,379
- My ex-wife's husband.

891
01:07:27,949 --> 01:07:28,917
I always thought she married him

892
01:07:29,049 --> 01:07:31,586
in part because he was Black.

893
01:07:32,620 --> 01:07:35,355
Point out the differences
between us.

894
01:07:42,697 --> 01:07:47,467
Thinking about that says an
awful lot about who I am.

895
01:07:50,772 --> 01:07:54,676
I'm not sure it's the man
I set out to be.

896
01:07:57,612 --> 01:07:59,747
I thought I had it
all figured out.

897
01:07:59,881 --> 01:08:01,114
I really did.

898
01:08:02,115 --> 01:08:03,785
That the universe
was bound together

899
01:08:03,918 --> 01:08:07,789
by all the beautiful things
I believed in.

900
01:08:10,257 --> 01:08:11,626
- Come.

901
01:08:13,226 --> 01:08:14,261
Lie down.

902
01:08:18,032 --> 01:08:19,399
- But I was wrong.

903
01:08:24,939 --> 01:08:25,773
- Come on.

904
01:08:27,441 --> 01:08:29,777
You need to rest your brain.

905
01:09:15,657 --> 01:09:17,792
Don't beat yourself up.

906
01:09:20,427 --> 01:09:23,397
You're doing what
you need to do.

907
01:09:29,537 --> 01:09:34,742
The thing is, we're all
fucked up and wrong,

908
01:09:40,480 --> 01:09:43,450
trying to hide all the shit
that's broken.

909
01:10:02,870 --> 01:10:06,607
If I were to be
truly straight with you,

910
01:10:14,515 --> 01:10:17,384
when I first came out, you know,

911
01:10:20,353 --> 01:10:22,824
it wasn't just about revenge,

912
01:10:25,793 --> 01:10:26,794
helping you.

913
01:10:45,680 --> 01:10:47,982
But you were right.

914
01:10:54,622 --> 01:10:57,592
Cyrus didn't give
a shit about me.

915
01:11:03,965 --> 01:11:05,733
I was nothing to him.

916
01:11:18,478 --> 01:11:20,815
- No going home, I guess.

917
01:11:32,827 --> 01:11:35,997
- I'm sorry you had to
kill someone.

918
01:11:38,733 --> 01:11:40,568
I'm sorry it was over me.

919
01:11:45,807 --> 01:11:48,042
- It's funny the things we,

920
01:11:50,745 --> 01:11:54,582
we tell ourselves
without saying anything.

921
01:11:55,249 --> 01:11:57,350
the agreements we make.

922
01:11:58,219 --> 01:11:59,020
- Yeah.

923
01:12:03,291 --> 01:12:05,827
- I'm sorry you had to suffer.

924
01:12:06,994 --> 01:12:08,629
- It's all right.

925
01:12:11,498 --> 01:12:12,934
My body they had.

926
01:12:15,736 --> 01:12:18,072
The rest they'll never find.

927
01:14:17,825 --> 01:14:20,861
- Whoo!

928
01:14:22,163 --> 01:14:24,865
Yeah!

929
01:14:43,517 --> 01:14:45,653
Yes! Yes, baby!

930
01:14:45,786 --> 01:14:48,622
Darling motherfucking!

931
01:14:48,756 --> 01:14:51,359
Oh, fuck! Jesus Christ!

932
01:14:51,491 --> 01:14:55,363
I don't want any fucking
psychodrama from you right now.

933
01:14:55,495 --> 01:14:58,132
- We need to talk.
Outside now.

934
01:14:58,265 --> 01:15:01,068
- Easy! Easy! Easy!

935
01:15:01,202 --> 01:15:03,204
What the fuck?

936
01:15:04,472 --> 01:15:07,441
What the fuck, man?

937
01:15:08,109 --> 01:15:11,078
What the fuck do you want, man?

938
01:15:11,879 --> 01:15:15,049
- Where's Cyrus?
- I don't know.

939
01:15:15,182 --> 01:15:17,618
- Yeah, you do.
- I don't fucking know, man.

940
01:15:17,752 --> 01:15:19,153
I have no fucking idea.

941
01:15:19,286 --> 01:15:20,654
You don't think I know
what's wheelin',

942
01:15:20,788 --> 01:15:22,256
you fool fuckin' prick?

943
01:15:22,390 --> 01:15:24,058
You think because you
have some business,

944
01:15:24,191 --> 01:15:25,593
that you're going to
stay alive and well?

945
01:15:25,726 --> 01:15:27,128
Forget it.

946
01:15:27,261 --> 01:15:29,697
The moment he started on you
in that room,

947
01:15:29,830 --> 01:15:31,265
he already had the vision.

948
01:15:31,399 --> 01:15:34,035
He's putting the black evocation
on your ass right now.

949
01:15:34,168 --> 01:15:36,437
Yeah. I think you're just
trying to fill me up

950
01:15:36,570 --> 01:15:38,773
with your of junkie devil shit

951
01:15:38,906 --> 01:15:41,709
'cause your ass wants to
revenge cuz you got fucked.

952
01:15:43,277 --> 01:15:44,612
- Now, you're gonna show
the lady some respect.

953
01:15:44,745 --> 01:15:46,147
We have business here.

954
01:15:46,280 --> 01:15:48,449
All right, man. However you want
to fucking sell it.

955
01:15:48,582 --> 01:15:49,650
- Where is he?

956
01:15:49,784 --> 01:15:52,620
I don't know.

957
01:15:52,753 --> 01:15:55,589
I don't know.
He says he's gonna contact me.

958
01:15:55,723 --> 01:15:57,658
- This is all talk sickness.
- I swear to God.

959
01:15:57,792 --> 01:15:59,260
He fucking said
he's gonna reach out.

960
01:15:59,393 --> 01:16:00,928
- You're fucking with
the black riders, yuppie boy.

961
01:16:01,062 --> 01:16:03,030
We ain't giving you
another pass.

962
01:16:03,164 --> 01:16:04,832
How many times do I have to
fucking say it,

963
01:16:04,965 --> 01:16:07,802
you stupid bitch.
I don't fucking know!

964
01:16:10,104 --> 01:16:12,673
- Fucking kill you!
Come out of your dreams!

965
01:16:13,741 --> 01:16:15,042
I'll play witch and disciple
across your throat while you sle

966
01:16:15,176 --> 01:16:16,477
across your throat
while you sleep!

967
01:16:16,610 --> 01:16:18,712
- Are you out of
your fucking mind?

968
01:16:18,846 --> 01:16:20,181
He's in the ranger station.

969
01:16:20,314 --> 01:16:22,750
Where else would he be,
you fucking bitch!

970
01:16:22,883 --> 01:16:24,553
- Bitch!
- Oh, my God!

971
01:16:24,685 --> 01:16:26,187
- Oh, right, I'm a bitch? Huh?

972
01:16:26,320 --> 01:16:29,156
What'd you say,
that I'm a fucking bitch?

973
01:16:29,290 --> 01:16:32,626
Come on!
You wanna fucking lie to me?!

974
01:16:33,194 --> 01:16:34,228
Fucking scum bag!

975
01:16:34,361 --> 01:16:35,729
- You know what? Fuck you!

976
01:16:35,863 --> 01:16:37,665
- You should have
let me fucking kill him.

977
01:16:37,798 --> 01:16:39,266
He's gonna screw us,
you know that?

978
01:16:39,400 --> 01:16:40,668
He's gonna fucking screw us!

979
01:16:40,801 --> 01:16:43,137
- Let it go for now.

980
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:48,275
- You should have
let me cross him.

981
01:20:56,423 --> 01:20:58,025
Hey!

982
01:21:34,863 --> 01:21:37,998
- You all right?
- Yeah.

983
01:21:47,207 --> 01:21:50,310
- You know something,
don't you?

984
01:21:51,613 --> 01:21:54,948
Is my daughter dead?
Did they kill her?

985
01:21:56,917 --> 01:22:00,120
I don't know. They could have.

986
01:22:25,212 --> 01:22:28,382
- It's a death rite.
- What?

987
01:22:29,884 --> 01:22:33,053
- They bring children here.

988
01:22:39,059 --> 01:22:42,229
Drug them, rape them.

989
01:22:43,397 --> 01:22:46,099
In the end, they're killed.

990
01:22:47,902 --> 01:22:51,071
- Goddamnit! God fucking damnit!

991
01:22:51,972 --> 01:22:53,908
- Not all, but mostly all.

992
01:22:54,041 --> 01:22:55,944
They keep some like me.

993
01:22:56,076 --> 01:22:57,077
- No!

994
01:22:57,211 --> 01:22:58,245
We gotta get out of here, okay?

995
01:22:58,378 --> 01:23:00,047
- No, hold on. Hold on.

996
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:01,482
What about that dope?

997
01:23:01,616 --> 01:23:04,117
That shit Cyrus had to
deliver to Errol.

998
01:23:04,251 --> 01:23:06,320
Could it be here? Is it possible

999
01:23:06,453 --> 01:23:08,989
- We can't look for it.
We don't have time.

1000
01:23:09,122 --> 01:23:11,291
- Don't matter.

1001
01:23:12,092 --> 01:23:14,762
Let's send Cyrus a message.

1002
01:23:41,789 --> 01:23:44,024
- Headcase.

1003
01:23:45,960 --> 01:23:48,128
- Oh, yeah?

1004
01:23:48,997 --> 01:23:50,330
How do you know?

1005
01:23:50,464 --> 01:23:53,300
- I saw her less
than 24 hours ago.

1006
01:23:53,433 --> 01:23:55,703
She wanted me to
send you a message.

1007
01:23:55,837 --> 01:23:58,405
- That fucking cunt's got
nine lives.

1008
01:23:58,540 --> 01:23:59,874
- Go on.

1009
01:24:00,008 --> 01:24:03,645
- Says they took all the product
you moved across the border.

1010
01:24:04,244 --> 01:24:06,380
- They did, huh?
- Yeah.

1011
01:24:06,514 --> 01:24:08,616
- She said that?
- Yeah.

1012
01:24:08,750 --> 01:24:10,552
Her and the doorstop.

1013
01:24:10,685 --> 01:24:12,954
Says that she took it
out of the house.

1014
01:24:13,086 --> 01:24:16,256
But um, did they?

1015
01:24:18,158 --> 01:24:19,994
Did they get that?

1016
01:24:20,127 --> 01:24:21,629
Did you put it in the house?

1017
01:24:21,763 --> 01:24:23,263
You couldn't have
put it in the house.

1018
01:24:23,397 --> 01:24:26,133
Be a mad move.
And you don't make bad moves.

1019
01:24:26,266 --> 01:24:28,903
I mean, you could do
bad things, but...

1020
01:24:29,037 --> 01:24:31,573
Right? 'Cause that's, you know,
a lot of fucking--

1021
01:24:31,706 --> 01:24:34,876
It's a lot of fucking--
fucking product.

1022
01:24:35,777 --> 01:24:37,745
- How did she know about
this place, Errol?

1023
01:24:37,879 --> 01:24:40,213
- I don't know.

1024
01:24:40,848 --> 01:24:42,316
But get this.

1025
01:24:42,449 --> 01:24:45,285
She wants to meet you.

1026
01:24:45,419 --> 01:24:48,590
- To meet me?
- Yes.

1027
01:24:51,993 --> 01:24:54,929
Says she wants to

1028
01:24:55,997 --> 01:24:59,801
trade the product
that she stole for some girl.

1029
01:25:01,869 --> 01:25:04,806
Says you'd know about it.

1030
01:25:26,460 --> 01:25:29,631
- Who's got the magic?
- Oh, you found it.

1031
01:25:33,433 --> 01:25:36,604
- Hail Satan.
- Hail Satan, motherfucker.

1032
01:25:37,939 --> 01:25:40,908
- It's on now.

1033
01:25:41,976 --> 01:25:43,377
- Is that the crank?

1034
01:26:33,828 --> 01:26:35,797
Yeah! Yeah!

1035
01:27:01,956 --> 01:27:03,825
Show time.

1036
01:27:31,953 --> 01:27:33,821
- I've been thinking.

1037
01:27:38,226 --> 01:27:43,030
Might have to accept the fact
that Gabi's already dead.

1038
01:27:47,101 --> 01:27:49,436
- Either way, we gotta find out.

1039
01:27:49,570 --> 01:27:50,838
Can't give up.

1040
01:27:50,972 --> 01:27:54,374
- No, she, my little girl.
You know?

1041
01:28:04,585 --> 01:28:06,521
I used to believe that
my faith protected me,

1042
01:28:06,654 --> 01:28:09,190
that every action of
the soul was meaningful.

1043
01:28:09,322 --> 01:28:10,625
I really did.

1044
01:28:11,659 --> 01:28:15,596
That we're more than just
flesh, bone, molecules.

1045
01:28:16,798 --> 01:28:20,568
That God was good and
everything would work out.

1046
01:28:25,438 --> 01:28:27,642
What am I talking about?

1047
01:28:30,178 --> 01:28:33,413
You don't believe in
any of that, do you?

1048
01:28:34,481 --> 01:28:36,517
- No, Coyote, I don't.

1049
01:28:38,119 --> 01:28:42,089
I think we all know what
life is really about.

1050
01:28:42,223 --> 01:28:46,093
We're not just ready
to accept the bad news.

1051
01:28:46,994 --> 01:28:49,197
So we fight it with God
and the Devil

1052
01:28:49,329 --> 01:28:51,833
and all this New Age bullshit.

1053
01:28:52,900 --> 01:28:55,636
Everyone needs a club, right?

1054
01:28:55,770 --> 01:28:59,507
Club God or Club Scream.
Take your pick.

1055
01:29:02,375 --> 01:29:03,978
But when it comes down to it,

1056
01:29:04,111 --> 01:29:08,850
we all know that it's X amount
of years and then the ground.

1057
01:29:22,296 --> 01:29:23,496
Take a look.

1058
01:29:25,900 --> 01:29:29,003
This is the ultimate life form,

1059
01:29:29,136 --> 01:29:30,838
the great equalizer.

1060
01:29:32,006 --> 01:29:34,609
It has no ties,

1061
01:29:34,742 --> 01:29:37,845
plays no favorites.

1062
01:29:38,546 --> 01:29:40,014
All life falls before it.

1063
01:29:41,916 --> 01:29:43,284
It's as simple and profound

1064
01:29:43,416 --> 01:29:46,787
as any parable
the Bible could slop up.

1065
01:29:52,425 --> 01:29:54,095
This is God, Coyote,

1066
01:29:55,997 --> 01:29:58,065
grin and bear it.

1067
01:30:15,783 --> 01:30:17,985
- Gonna get a cigarette.

1068
01:31:27,421 --> 01:31:28,255
- Bob!

1069
01:32:17,505 --> 01:32:18,439
- You're gonna tell us.

1070
01:32:18,572 --> 01:32:19,540
Where's my daughter?

1071
01:32:19,673 --> 01:32:21,609
Where's my daughter?

1072
01:32:26,714 --> 01:32:27,782
- Bob?

1073
01:32:31,052 --> 01:32:31,886
Bob.

1074
01:32:32,521 --> 01:32:33,554
Bob.

1075
01:32:37,324 --> 01:32:38,527
Fuck.

1076
01:32:41,462 --> 01:32:43,798
Granny, you gotta tell us.

1077
01:32:44,665 --> 01:32:46,867
Is the girl still alive?

1078
01:32:47,835 --> 01:32:50,037
- Come and get me, cunt.

1079
01:32:50,838 --> 01:32:53,607
- You're crossing over.

1080
01:33:20,768 --> 01:33:22,303
- What happened?

1081
01:33:38,853 --> 01:33:40,821
Okay, Bob Whatever.

1082
01:33:40,955 --> 01:33:42,524
I'm gonna play a little medic,
okay?

1083
01:33:42,656 --> 01:33:46,293
Going to do a little memory
time on the late night river.

1084
01:33:47,761 --> 01:33:49,063
All that catch-dogging got

1085
01:33:49,196 --> 01:33:51,765
those nerve endings burnt up
pretty bad.

1086
01:33:51,899 --> 01:33:53,467
Heart is all over the place.

1087
01:33:53,602 --> 01:33:55,402
You going to go into shock soon.

1088
01:33:55,537 --> 01:33:59,574
Or you could die from the horse
protein I'm gonna give you.

1089
01:33:59,707 --> 01:34:00,975
Can you hear me?

1090
01:34:01,108 --> 01:34:02,611
- Thirsty.
- What?

1091
01:34:02,743 --> 01:34:04,011
- I'm real thirsty.

1092
01:34:04,145 --> 01:34:04,945
- Okay.

1093
01:34:06,113 --> 01:34:08,849
You should have let me
finish throwing them coins.

1094
01:34:08,983 --> 01:34:11,685
You might be dead already
and we just wasting time.

1095
01:34:23,230 --> 01:34:26,167
I'm gonna give you
a little fun juice.

1096
01:34:26,934 --> 01:34:29,403
So, whatever trip you make

1097
01:34:29,538 --> 01:34:32,907
I'm gonna make it a little
more enjoyable for you now.

1098
01:34:48,756 --> 01:34:51,492
- You think he's gonna make it?

1099
01:34:51,626 --> 01:34:52,459
- Maybe.

1100
01:34:53,727 --> 01:34:56,197
But if I was a betting man,

1101
01:34:57,131 --> 01:35:00,100
I'd say we looking
at a dead man.

1102
01:35:06,707 --> 01:35:08,209
- How you feeling?

1103
01:35:10,679 --> 01:35:11,912
I love you.

1104
01:35:12,046 --> 01:35:13,781
I love you, Gabi.

1105
01:35:13,914 --> 01:35:17,318
You're gonna be okay,
sweetheart.

1106
01:35:17,451 --> 01:35:19,186
You're gonna be okay.

1107
01:35:19,987 --> 01:35:21,255
Is it better?

1108
01:35:21,388 --> 01:35:22,723
Do you feel it?

1109
01:35:22,856 --> 01:35:25,259
Yeah, that's good.

1110
01:35:27,662 --> 01:35:28,495
Now,

1111
01:35:31,732 --> 01:35:32,800
it's gonna be okay.

1112
01:35:32,933 --> 01:35:34,603
- It's okay.

1113
01:35:34,735 --> 01:35:35,670
It's okay.

1114
01:35:35,803 --> 01:35:38,239
Breathe. You gotta breathe.

1115
01:35:38,372 --> 01:35:39,206
Please.

1116
01:35:41,075 --> 01:35:42,843
- You take her.

1117
01:35:42,977 --> 01:35:43,944
Promise me, right?
- Okay.

1118
01:35:44,078 --> 01:35:46,747
- If she's alive, you, you...

1119
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:48,415
- Sure. Sure, I can.

1120
01:35:48,550 --> 01:35:52,786
- You're the only one I
trust. So you take her.

1121
01:35:52,920 --> 01:35:55,189
You promise me. Promise me!

1122
01:35:57,659 --> 01:35:58,359
- Yes, I promise.

1123
01:35:58,492 --> 01:35:59,326
- Mm?

1124
01:36:42,970 --> 01:36:44,938
- Alive, huh?

1125
01:36:46,541 --> 01:36:48,375
- Yeah, looks like it.

1126
01:36:55,816 --> 01:36:57,318
- Are you thirsty?

1127
01:36:58,753 --> 01:36:59,587
- Yeah.

1128
01:38:03,785 --> 01:38:06,554
- I'm glad you made it, Coyote.

1129
01:38:47,928 --> 01:38:49,631
- What's going on?

1130
01:38:49,764 --> 01:38:51,398
- Cyrus called.

1131
01:38:51,533 --> 01:38:53,400
We let you sleep.

1132
01:38:53,535 --> 01:38:55,002
- What's this?

1133
01:38:55,135 --> 01:38:57,104
- It's bon voyage, Bee-Dub.

1134
01:38:57,237 --> 01:38:59,339
Means get the fuck out.

1135
01:39:07,147 --> 01:39:08,382
- You ready?

1136
01:39:11,018 --> 01:39:12,219
- I'm ready.

1137
01:40:03,738 --> 01:40:05,740
- Not even a kiss hello?

1138
01:40:17,819 --> 01:40:19,119
I'm sorry about Mexico.

1139
01:40:19,253 --> 01:40:20,722
- It's all right.
- I tried to stop him, Case.

1140
01:40:20,855 --> 01:40:22,189
- Just forget about it.

1141
01:40:25,894 --> 01:40:26,761
- Okay.

1142
01:40:34,034 --> 01:40:36,069
- Is that the boy toy?

1143
01:40:42,877 --> 01:40:44,344
Got the shit with you?

1144
01:40:44,478 --> 01:40:46,113
- It's in the back.

1145
01:40:46,246 --> 01:40:48,081
- So where we going?

1146
01:40:49,651 --> 01:40:50,752
- Take 14 South.

1147
01:40:50,885 --> 01:40:51,786
- To where?

1148
01:40:54,622 --> 01:40:56,925
- You know, you and I don't
have to not get along, you know?

1149
01:40:57,057 --> 01:40:58,726
- We ain't gonna be around
each other long enough

1150
01:40:58,860 --> 01:41:00,227
for one way or the other, sheep.

1151
01:41:00,360 --> 01:41:02,730
Just take fucking 14 South.

1152
01:41:09,169 --> 01:41:11,305
- Yeah. Yeah.

1153
01:41:12,372 --> 01:41:14,308
- What the--
what the fuck, dude!

1154
01:41:15,309 --> 01:41:16,644
- Cyrus called.

1155
01:41:16,778 --> 01:41:18,278
He said you hired him
to go into the house.

1156
01:41:18,412 --> 01:41:20,682
- And you're going to
believe that psychopath?

1157
01:41:20,815 --> 01:41:22,182
- Why would he lie?

1158
01:41:22,316 --> 01:41:23,518
- To get back at us for
Furnace Creek, Arthur.

1159
01:41:23,651 --> 01:41:24,786
He's trying to fuck
with our heads.

1160
01:41:24,919 --> 01:41:26,453
- Stop it! Stop!

1161
01:41:26,588 --> 01:41:28,890
- He said you hired him
to kill Sam

1162
01:41:29,023 --> 01:41:30,758
because Sam was fucking Maureen.

1163
01:41:30,892 --> 01:41:32,392
How would he know that?!

1164
01:41:32,527 --> 01:41:35,697
If he was a liar,
how would he know?

1165
01:41:39,499 --> 01:41:41,869
- Who is this Cyrus?

1166
01:41:43,972 --> 01:41:46,273
Who the fuck is Cyrus?

1167
01:41:47,575 --> 01:41:49,577
- Go ahead, breast beater.
Tell her our little secret.

1168
01:41:50,745 --> 01:41:52,245
- Just sign it, Nona.
It's a lot of money.

1169
01:41:52,379 --> 01:41:55,516
- Yes, this is a very,
very generous offer.

1170
01:41:56,216 --> 01:41:57,685
Once in a lifetime, Nona.

1171
01:41:57,819 --> 01:42:00,822
Can I call you, Nona?
Cuz I feel like I've known-ya.

1172
01:42:03,091 --> 01:42:05,627
- Maybe. Well, luxury homes?

1173
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:07,095
- That's right.
Luxury homes,

1174
01:42:07,227 --> 01:42:08,796
at a reasonable price.

1175
01:42:09,764 --> 01:42:11,733
- Churches.
- Christian. Christian.

1176
01:42:11,866 --> 01:42:13,735
- Christian. I like that.

1177
01:42:13,868 --> 01:42:15,268
You know I'm a Catholic.

1178
01:42:15,402 --> 01:42:17,572
- The best of us are, Nona.
The best of us are.

1179
01:42:18,606 --> 01:42:20,340
- Especially when it comes to

1180
01:42:20,474 --> 01:42:22,543
my good Catholic friend
right here

1181
01:42:22,677 --> 01:42:25,278
who's gonna be his partner,
I know.

1182
01:42:27,314 --> 01:42:30,450
- Oh, oh, oh! Whoo, whoo, whoo!

1183
01:42:41,228 --> 01:42:43,798
- I'm not selling.

1184
01:42:45,900 --> 01:42:48,936
- Cyrus, I thought you said
this was a done deal.

1185
01:42:49,070 --> 01:42:50,470
- It is a done deal.

1186
01:42:50,605 --> 01:42:52,372
Look at it one more time, Nona.

1187
01:42:53,508 --> 01:42:55,109
It's stupid land.
You don't even care about it!

1188
01:42:55,242 --> 01:42:58,378
- Cyrus, when Nona says no,
it's no.

1189
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:03,618
Guys, you know, I love my birds.

1190
01:43:04,152 --> 01:43:06,453
I'm gonna keep my land.

1191
01:43:09,557 --> 01:43:11,859
- I'm gonna step outside, guys.

1192
01:43:11,993 --> 01:43:13,695
- I'm gonna go too.

1193
01:43:17,098 --> 01:43:19,667
- Hey, John Lee, watch this.

1194
01:43:30,011 --> 01:43:32,680
- You stupid fucking junkie.

1195
01:43:35,917 --> 01:43:37,819
- What happened?

1196
01:43:41,589 --> 01:43:44,759
- I think this crazy fuck
just solved our problems.

1197
01:43:45,760 --> 01:43:47,795
- Holy shit, John Lee.
What are we gonna do?

1198
01:43:47,929 --> 01:43:49,262
- Don't worry.

1199
01:43:49,396 --> 01:43:51,099
You just take the brochures and

1200
01:43:51,231 --> 01:43:53,668
- Yeah, yeah.
He's right, Arthur. Arthur.

1201
01:43:53,801 --> 01:43:56,369
Arthur, come on. I got this.

1202
01:43:56,503 --> 01:43:58,371
No, no, I got it, I got it.
You go home.

1203
01:43:58,505 --> 01:43:59,907
You know,
I'll take care of everything.

1204
01:44:00,041 --> 01:44:01,676
This is a good thing. Okay?

1205
01:44:12,854 --> 01:44:15,455
All right.
You have the signature?

1206
01:44:15,590 --> 01:44:17,592
- Yeah, it's right there.

1207
01:44:18,626 --> 01:44:21,461
- Oh, it's perfect.
Okay, I got this.

1208
01:44:21,596 --> 01:44:23,164
You clean everything else up.

1209
01:44:23,330 --> 01:44:24,766
- Yeah, I got it.

1210
01:44:25,533 --> 01:44:26,901
- I'll be in touch.

1211
01:44:27,034 --> 01:44:29,771
- Ha ha! Ha ha!

1212
01:44:32,573 --> 01:44:35,743
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

1213
01:44:37,078 --> 01:44:40,014
Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah!

1214
01:44:48,823 --> 01:44:51,993
Arthur, is that true?

1215
01:44:54,128 --> 01:44:56,764
- Yeah, it's true.

1216
01:45:06,306 --> 01:45:09,777
- Honey, don't take it so badly.

1217
01:45:09,911 --> 01:45:13,815
Just trying to put a little
away for our golden jubilees.

1218
01:45:15,315 --> 01:45:16,551
Arthur, listen to me.

1219
01:45:16,684 --> 01:45:17,952
Cyrus is smart.

1220
01:45:18,085 --> 01:45:19,854
He knows Bob's out there
looking for him.

1221
01:45:20,487 --> 01:45:21,923
- John Lee...

1222
01:45:22,056 --> 01:45:22,857
- So you need to get to him
and get him off the road.

1223
01:45:23,891 --> 01:45:24,992
- And not just for his sake.
- Sweetheart.

1224
01:45:25,126 --> 01:45:26,294
- Just a second. Listen...

1225
01:45:26,426 --> 01:45:27,929
You don't want Cyrus caught,
okay?

1226
01:45:28,062 --> 01:45:29,964
We'd make a pretty picture
in the papers, wouldn't we?

1227
01:45:30,097 --> 01:45:32,800
- Honey...
- What is it, you cunt parrot?

1228
01:45:53,988 --> 01:45:56,224
- Hey, give me my phone.
Case, give me my phone.

1229
01:45:56,356 --> 01:45:58,259
- Sit the fuck down.

1230
01:45:58,391 --> 01:45:59,426
- Are you kidding me?

1231
01:45:59,560 --> 01:46:00,595
- I said sit the fuck down!

1232
01:46:00,728 --> 01:46:02,797
- Give me
my fucking phone!

1233
01:46:02,930 --> 01:46:04,565
- It's me.
- Ah.

1234
01:46:04,699 --> 01:46:05,666
- Shut the fuck up.

1235
01:46:05,800 --> 01:46:07,335
- Hello, debased one.

1236
01:46:07,467 --> 01:46:09,369
Have you come home to be swallow

1237
01:46:09,502 --> 01:46:11,504
- Yes.
- I see.

1238
01:46:11,639 --> 01:46:14,709
- Well then, go see Errol.
Get my money.

1239
01:46:14,842 --> 01:46:18,546
He'll be waiting.
Bring the dope you stole from me

1240
01:46:18,679 --> 01:46:21,816
- Come on, Cyrus.
We both know there's no dope.

1241
01:46:21,949 --> 01:46:25,353
We know that you're onto us.

1242
01:46:25,485 --> 01:46:27,588
Lena told us everything.

1243
01:46:27,722 --> 01:46:30,825
- No, I fucking didn't!
They're fucking lying!

1244
01:46:32,059 --> 01:46:34,328
Cyrus, I didn't say
fucking anything!

1245
01:46:34,461 --> 01:46:36,764
I didn't say fucking anything!
Help!

1246
01:46:37,899 --> 01:46:39,667
Fuck you!

1247
01:46:42,136 --> 01:46:45,573
- I don't care.
Get my money from Errol.

1248
01:46:45,706 --> 01:46:47,174
- What money?

1249
01:46:47,308 --> 01:46:49,543
- I told Errol the product
would be delivered tonight

1250
01:46:49,677 --> 01:46:53,147
and to have my money ready.
$100,000.

1251
01:46:53,281 --> 01:46:55,516
- But we don't have your
stuff. We don't have anything.

1252
01:46:55,650 --> 01:46:58,451
- Then I'd say you've got
a big fucking problem.

1253
01:46:58,586 --> 01:47:01,989
Sundown, Energy road.
See you there.

1254
01:47:02,123 --> 01:47:04,258
- But, how?
What do we trade with?

1255
01:47:04,392 --> 01:47:07,161
- I don't know.
Your lives, I guess.

1256
01:47:16,938 --> 01:47:18,773
- He wants us to kill Errol.

1257
01:47:18,906 --> 01:47:20,541
- What?

1258
01:47:20,675 --> 01:47:23,678
- Take the money. Errol's
waiting to make a trade.

1259
01:47:23,811 --> 01:47:25,913
We bring Cyrus the money,
he gives us the girl.

1260
01:47:26,047 --> 01:47:28,115
- You fucking killed me, Casey.

1261
01:47:28,249 --> 01:47:31,052
You fucking killed me.
I can never go back now.

1262
01:47:31,185 --> 01:47:34,655
Is that why you didn't let
this fucking sheep do it to me?

1263
01:47:34,789 --> 01:47:36,557
You fucking could.

1264
01:47:36,691 --> 01:47:38,225
No, fuck you! I'm fucking dead!

1265
01:47:38,359 --> 01:47:39,193
I have no fucking where to go.

1266
01:47:39,327 --> 01:47:40,661
- That's not our problem.

1267
01:47:40,795 --> 01:47:42,530
- Fuck you, sheep! Fuck you!

1268
01:47:42,663 --> 01:47:43,898
- Hey, you could help us.

1269
01:47:44,031 --> 01:47:46,434
- Fuck you too, then!
I ain't doing it!

1270
01:47:46,567 --> 01:47:50,271
- You're out on the street
with a bulleye on your back!

1271
01:47:50,404 --> 01:47:52,306
- Who the fuck are you, Case?

1272
01:47:52,440 --> 01:47:54,575
- That's it. Enough.
Get out.

1273
01:47:54,709 --> 01:47:57,111
- You fucking get the fuck out.

1274
01:47:57,244 --> 01:48:01,816
No! Casey, you fucking tell
him. You know I didn't!

1275
01:48:01,949 --> 01:48:03,684
- No! No!

1276
01:48:03,818 --> 01:48:06,554
No, Casey! You fucking tell him!

1277
01:48:06,687 --> 01:48:09,790
No! Casey! No!

1278
01:48:12,193 --> 01:48:13,728
- What the fuck.

1279
01:48:13,861 --> 01:48:15,262
- Fucking leave it.

1280
01:48:15,396 --> 01:48:18,199
- Fuck you!

1281
01:48:18,332 --> 01:48:20,468
You fucking traitor!

1282
01:48:20,601 --> 01:48:22,169
You fucking sheep!

1283
01:48:22,303 --> 01:48:24,572
You're the fucking sheep!

1284
01:48:28,976 --> 01:48:30,978
Fuck you!

1285
01:48:31,112 --> 01:48:33,681
Fuck you!

1286
01:48:37,618 --> 01:48:39,954
Fuck you looking at, pervert?

1287
01:49:06,213 --> 01:49:09,683
- Hey.
- Hey.

1288
01:49:15,689 --> 01:49:17,925
Girl, what are you doing?

1289
01:49:19,093 --> 01:49:20,828
You were all the way
out and then come back

1290
01:49:20,961 --> 01:49:24,632
with this big old neon
sign around your neck.

1291
01:49:24,765 --> 01:49:28,002
Shooting the place up,
guns blazing. Why?

1292
01:49:29,236 --> 01:49:30,571
May as well have
slit your own throat.

1293
01:49:30,704 --> 01:49:32,073
- I know.

1294
01:49:32,206 --> 01:49:34,675
- You think we didn't know
about your little rehab?

1295
01:49:34,809 --> 01:49:37,512
- We gave you the pass.
- I know.

1296
01:49:38,446 --> 01:49:41,348
You don't think I know?
I fucking know.

1297
01:49:42,583 --> 01:49:46,587
I need you to tell him
something for me, Wood.

1298
01:49:46,720 --> 01:49:48,756
Tell him he can have me.

1299
01:49:48,889 --> 01:49:51,826
I'll bring the money,
I'll bring everything.

1300
01:49:51,959 --> 01:49:54,728
He can do whatever the
fuck he wants with me,

1301
01:49:54,862 --> 01:49:57,631
have a field day
with my dead body.

1302
01:49:57,765 --> 01:50:00,634
Just let the girl go.

1303
01:50:02,136 --> 01:50:05,739
That's the deal. Me for her.

1304
01:50:05,873 --> 01:50:07,641
You tell him.

1305
01:50:07,775 --> 01:50:10,711
- What do you want
me to say, Casey?

1306
01:50:10,845 --> 01:50:14,448
We both know
how this is gonna end.

1307
01:50:14,583 --> 01:50:16,684
- I gotta have this one, Wood.

1308
01:50:16,817 --> 01:50:19,453
He doesn't want the girl.
He wants me.

1309
01:50:19,588 --> 01:50:21,889
You tell him that.

1310
01:50:23,491 --> 01:50:26,160
- Alright. I'll tell him.

1311
01:50:43,244 --> 01:50:45,980
- Let's do this.
- Time to get swallowed.

1312
01:50:51,852 --> 01:50:55,289
- Stop right there.
Put the bags down.

1313
01:50:57,892 --> 01:51:01,262
Now show me your hands
and back the fuck up.

1314
01:51:56,450 --> 01:51:58,419
- All right,
I'll take my bag back.

1315
01:51:58,553 --> 01:51:59,753
- Oh, yeah?

1316
01:51:59,887 --> 01:52:01,121
- You haven't paid
for it yet, Slick.

1317
01:52:01,255 --> 01:52:04,858
- How about
I pay for it right now?

1318
01:52:23,911 --> 01:52:26,213
- No. No. No!

1319
01:52:26,347 --> 01:52:29,750
Fuck no! No! Get the fuck out.

1320
01:52:29,883 --> 01:52:32,386
Hey! Easy. Easy. Easy. Come on!

1321
01:52:32,520 --> 01:52:33,754
What are you doing, huh?

1322
01:52:33,887 --> 01:52:35,590
This is my fucking
house. What do you want?

1323
01:52:35,724 --> 01:52:39,860
Fuck you!
I'm so fucking over it!

1324
01:52:39,994 --> 01:52:41,428
You want the money?
Is that what you want?

1325
01:52:41,563 --> 01:52:43,698
You got the fucking
money. Actually, take it.

1326
01:52:43,864 --> 01:52:45,032
- Bob.
- It's not my fucking money.

1327
01:52:45,165 --> 01:52:46,934
- Shut the fuck up.

1328
01:52:49,503 --> 01:52:51,673
- Bob.
- What?

1329
01:52:51,805 --> 01:52:53,173
- What?

1330
01:52:57,679 --> 01:53:01,583
Fucking take it!
Fucking take it!

1331
01:53:01,716 --> 01:53:03,250
- You're crossing over.

1332
01:53:38,720 --> 01:53:41,388
- So, what are we doing?

1333
01:53:41,523 --> 01:53:44,793
We get Headcase, and you
get the girl, correct?

1334
01:53:44,925 --> 01:53:46,226
That's the arrangement?

1335
01:53:46,360 --> 01:53:49,863
- No. No. No.
Get the fuck away from here.

1336
01:53:49,997 --> 01:53:51,165
- You stick that gun up my face,

1337
01:53:51,298 --> 01:53:52,567
I'll stick it up
your fucking ass, bitch!

1338
01:53:52,701 --> 01:53:54,703
- I'm gonna cut you like
a bitch, motherfucker!

1339
01:53:54,835 --> 01:53:56,270
- It's all right.

1340
01:53:56,403 --> 01:53:57,772
- What do you mean it's alright?
It's not fucking alright.

1341
01:53:57,905 --> 01:53:59,006
- I made a deal, okay?
- You what?

1342
01:53:59,139 --> 01:54:00,508
- I'll eat your fucking face!

1343
01:54:00,642 --> 01:54:02,309
- I made a
fucking deal, okay?

1344
01:54:02,443 --> 01:54:04,878
- You're dying tonight,
bitch! You're fucking dying!

1345
01:54:56,997 --> 01:54:58,833
- I'm confused.

1346
01:54:58,966 --> 01:55:02,069
This is what she proposed,
correct?

1347
01:55:02,903 --> 01:55:04,839
But, now it's no good?

1348
01:55:04,972 --> 01:55:07,207
- No good.

1349
01:55:07,341 --> 01:55:09,209
I'm not trading her. I'm not
trading her for anything.

1350
01:55:09,343 --> 01:55:10,745
- Oh, come on, Bob.

1351
01:55:10,879 --> 01:55:12,946
- Shut up. Shut the fuck up!

1352
01:55:15,717 --> 01:55:18,952
- So, what exactly is it
that you're offering, Bob?

1353
01:55:25,727 --> 01:55:26,861
- Where's the rest of it?

1354
01:55:26,994 --> 01:55:29,463
- Where's my fucking daughter?

1355
01:55:29,597 --> 01:55:30,765
You'll get the rest

1356
01:55:30,899 --> 01:55:33,500
when we've got Gabi and
we're safe and sound.

1357
01:55:33,635 --> 01:55:38,272
- Pay me later?
I don't think so, Bob.

1358
01:55:39,473 --> 01:55:41,975
It's not like I'm giving
you half your daughter back.

1359
01:55:43,745 --> 01:55:46,548
Your legacy's waiting
for you over that hill.

1360
01:55:46,681 --> 01:55:50,819
When you see her, just drop
the money and take her.

1361
01:55:50,951 --> 01:55:55,322
But all of it, Bob. Every penny.

1362
01:55:55,456 --> 01:55:57,559
And you and I are finished.

1363
01:55:59,092 --> 01:56:01,195
- Okay.

1364
01:56:03,163 --> 01:56:05,232
- One other thing.

1365
01:56:07,602 --> 01:56:10,572
When you get home,

1366
01:56:11,606 --> 01:56:14,576
Ask Arthur and John Lee
who killed the old witch.

1367
01:56:15,976 --> 01:56:17,411
Ask who hired me to go

1368
01:56:17,545 --> 01:56:20,481
carve up
your pretty little wife.

1369
01:56:21,950 --> 01:56:24,485
You ask.

1370
01:56:29,524 --> 01:56:31,626
- Let's go.

1371
01:56:31,759 --> 01:56:36,463
- Now you, headcase.
I want a word with you.

1372
01:56:53,982 --> 01:56:58,352
I just want you to know that
whatever happens tonight,

1373
01:56:59,754 --> 01:57:01,756
you're crossing over.

1374
01:57:02,857 --> 01:57:05,292
Oh, yeah. The word's out, honey.

1375
01:57:05,425 --> 01:57:08,663
We're coming out of
the gutter for you.

1376
01:57:08,796 --> 01:57:10,632
And when we find you,

1377
01:57:10,765 --> 01:57:14,468
just know that I'm going to be
right there to watch you beg.

1378
01:57:31,819 --> 01:57:33,521
- Unbelievable.
- What?

1379
01:57:33,655 --> 01:57:36,223
- You should have taken
the fucking deal.

1380
01:57:36,356 --> 01:57:37,725
- You go behind my back.
It's great.

1381
01:57:37,859 --> 01:57:39,527
- I had it all worked
out, you fucking idiot!

1382
01:57:39,661 --> 01:57:42,129
It was done,
you had your daughter backi!

1383
01:57:42,262 --> 01:57:43,698
- We don't trade people for--

1384
01:57:43,831 --> 01:57:46,099
- They're gonna come for
us, you know that, right?

1385
01:57:46,233 --> 01:57:47,669
They're not letting us go.

1386
01:57:47,802 --> 01:57:49,037
They're gonna ride us out
into the fucking black hole,

1387
01:57:49,169 --> 01:57:50,437
- then they'll come.
- I know!

1388
01:57:50,572 --> 01:57:51,539
If you know, then what's
your fucking plan?!

1389
01:57:51,673 --> 01:57:53,173
I don't have a plan, alright?!

1390
01:57:53,307 --> 01:57:56,410
Let's just go get Gabi
and we'll figure it out.

1391
01:58:32,981 --> 01:58:35,516
- Throw the fucking money over.

1392
01:59:07,749 --> 01:59:09,416
- Gabi!

1393
01:59:17,725 --> 01:59:20,795
- How you getting home, huh?

1394
01:59:22,262 --> 01:59:24,431
How you getting out?

1395
01:59:31,304 --> 01:59:32,807
- Thank God.

1396
02:00:12,914 --> 02:00:14,816
- Bob.

1397
02:00:18,452 --> 02:00:20,287
Bob, we gotta go.

1398
02:00:20,420 --> 02:00:22,623
They're coming for us, okay?

1399
02:00:22,757 --> 02:00:27,227
Bob. We have to get out of here.

1400
02:00:37,437 --> 02:00:40,407
Bob. Bob.

1401
02:00:40,541 --> 02:00:42,810
Where the fuck are you going?

1402
02:00:44,145 --> 02:00:46,814
Bob, talk to me.

1403
02:00:55,123 --> 02:00:56,824
Oh, fuck.

1404
02:01:12,039 --> 02:01:14,809
- Go to the end.
- Okay.

1405
02:01:18,311 --> 02:01:20,014
- Okay.

1406
02:01:23,017 --> 02:01:24,652
- All right.

1407
02:01:24,786 --> 02:01:28,756
- Some people are coming.
Some very bad people.

1408
02:01:28,890 --> 02:01:30,024
If they see you,

1409
02:01:30,158 --> 02:01:32,760
you point this at them
and you pull the trigger.

1410
02:01:32,894 --> 02:01:35,462
If you run out of bullets,
you just drop your gun,

1411
02:01:35,596 --> 02:01:37,330
pick up the next one.

1412
02:01:37,464 --> 02:01:40,968
And whatever you do, don't
come out till I come get you.

1413
02:01:43,137 --> 02:01:45,505
Gabi, I'm gonna go now.

1414
02:01:48,876 --> 02:01:50,645
- Dad.

1415
02:01:52,379 --> 02:01:54,381
Kill them.

1416
02:01:56,017 --> 02:01:58,586
Kill all of them.

1417
02:04:05,680 --> 02:04:07,048
- What the fuck are you doing?!

1418
02:04:07,181 --> 02:04:11,686
Bring the fucking cars up.
Everybody down the hill!

1419
02:06:01,595 --> 02:06:03,297
- Case!

1420
02:06:14,775 --> 02:06:18,345
- Hey, darling.
You don't look so hot.

1421
02:06:18,479 --> 02:06:19,914
- Fuck you.

1422
02:06:20,047 --> 02:06:21,682
- Yeah, we'll get to that.

1423
02:06:53,747 --> 02:06:56,317
- You're all out of bullets,
sweetheart.

1424
02:08:26,240 --> 02:08:27,908
- Dad.

1425
02:09:29,803 --> 02:09:31,505
It was after midnight.

1426
02:09:31,640 --> 02:09:34,475
My husband and I were in bed.

1427
02:09:34,609 --> 02:09:37,244
The phone rang

1428
02:09:37,378 --> 02:09:41,882
and somebody had
information on Gabi.

1429
02:09:42,916 --> 02:09:44,918
- Who?
- I don't know.

1430
02:09:45,620 --> 02:09:48,523
- John Lee got out of bed

1431
02:09:49,189 --> 02:09:52,326
and he said he'd be right back.

1432
02:09:53,460 --> 02:09:56,163
And that's the last I saw
or heard from him.

1433
02:09:57,131 --> 02:10:01,135
And then they found
my baby in his trunk.

1434
02:10:02,303 --> 02:10:05,005
So you never
knew any of these people?

1435
02:10:11,613 --> 02:10:13,480
- No.

1436
02:10:13,615 --> 02:10:17,084
- And you?
- Me what?

1437
02:10:17,217 --> 02:10:19,486
- Is there anything else
you want to add?

1438
02:10:19,621 --> 02:10:21,121
- No.

1439
02:10:21,255 --> 02:10:24,091
- We're sorry, Mr. Naci.
It's just protocol.

1440
02:10:24,224 --> 02:10:25,760
I understand,
but watch your tone.

1441
02:10:25,893 --> 02:10:29,063
I don't like the inference.
This woman just lost her husband

1442
02:10:29,664 --> 02:10:31,432
My best friend.

1443
02:10:32,266 --> 02:10:34,602
- Can I steal these two
for a minute?

1444
02:10:37,004 --> 02:10:39,106
- Hello, Bob.

1445
02:10:39,708 --> 02:10:41,576
- Hello, Arthur.

1446
02:10:47,981 --> 02:10:50,150
- Bob, what's going on?

1447
02:10:57,291 --> 02:11:00,427
- I'll have the truth now,
Arthur.

1448
02:11:01,295 --> 02:11:03,798
What did you do
to John Lee?

1449
02:11:03,931 --> 02:11:06,934
- What kind of thing
is that to say?

1450
02:11:08,902 --> 02:11:11,271
- You too, huh?

1451
02:11:12,540 --> 02:11:15,510
Did you tell her you were there
when the old lady got murdered?

1452
02:11:15,643 --> 02:11:17,244
- I know what happened
to the old woman.

1453
02:11:17,378 --> 02:11:20,515
- Maureen, careful where
you're going with this.

1454
02:11:20,648 --> 02:11:23,818
- You watch yourself with me,
Arthur, and I mean it.

1455
02:11:24,652 --> 02:11:26,554
I've tasted
a lot of blood lately,

1456
02:11:26,688 --> 02:11:29,624
and I'm not sure
I got a full stomach yet.

1457
02:11:30,324 --> 02:11:33,160
Maybe it's easier in the dark.

1458
02:11:34,061 --> 02:11:36,631
- Come on. Tell me.
- Bobby, stop.

1459
02:11:37,665 --> 02:11:38,966
- As long as
we can't see faces, right?

1460
02:11:39,099 --> 02:11:41,001
- You're scaring me.
- Come on.

1461
02:11:41,135 --> 02:11:43,937
What happened to John Lee?

1462
02:11:44,071 --> 02:11:46,140
- My husband is dead.

1463
02:11:46,273 --> 02:11:48,342
And just like
I told the police,

1464
02:11:48,475 --> 02:11:50,645
I don't know
what happened to him.

1465
02:11:50,779 --> 02:11:52,614
But I'll tell you this.
Whatever did happen,

1466
02:11:52,747 --> 02:11:55,115
I wish it happened
a hell of a lot sooner, alright?

1467
02:11:55,249 --> 02:11:57,484
Like last November.

1468
02:11:58,620 --> 02:12:00,120
- You and your half truths.
It's beautiful.

1469
02:12:00,254 --> 02:12:02,791
- Bobby, that's what life is.
Half truths.

1470
02:12:02,923 --> 02:12:05,058
- Is it?
- Sure.

1471
02:12:05,192 --> 02:12:07,695
Just ask Errol Gray.

1472
02:12:10,297 --> 02:12:13,568
No one's clean, son. No one.

1473
02:12:13,701 --> 02:12:16,503
Now for what you did,
to get Gabi back,

1474
02:12:16,638 --> 02:12:19,741
you should get a medal.
All of it.

1475
02:12:20,608 --> 02:12:23,444
Yeah, I fucked up in the past,
me and John Lee.

1476
02:12:23,578 --> 02:12:26,413
But we never touched
the old lady.

1477
02:12:26,548 --> 02:12:29,684
When we went in that trailer,
she was dead.

1478
02:12:30,552 --> 02:12:32,386
We walked away,
washed our hands of it,

1479
02:12:32,520 --> 02:12:35,956
and we let the punk go, and
that's the God's honest truth.

1480
02:12:39,993 --> 02:12:43,063
- You're a fucking liar.

1481
02:12:45,098 --> 02:12:47,334
You're both fucking liars.

1482
02:12:47,468 --> 02:12:50,471
- We all lie. We all cheat.

1483
02:12:50,605 --> 02:12:53,240
We all fail.

1484
02:12:53,373 --> 02:12:56,243
But that's not what
this is about, is it?

1485
02:12:56,376 --> 02:12:59,179
You just took us down here
to lay blame,

1486
02:12:59,313 --> 02:13:00,815
isn't that right? To find fault.

1487
02:13:00,949 --> 02:13:03,918
But who are you to blame? Hm?

1488
02:13:05,018 --> 02:13:08,857
Blame is for the ultimate judge.
And there is only one.

1489
02:13:08,989 --> 02:13:12,159
- Jesus. I know.

1490
02:13:13,160 --> 02:13:17,632
Only one.
And he will judge us all.

1491
02:13:18,198 --> 02:13:20,702
Hallelujah.

1492
02:13:47,729 --> 02:13:51,098
- You want to break them down,
don't you?

1493
02:13:51,833 --> 02:13:54,234
Burn them at the stake.

1494
02:13:56,136 --> 02:13:58,105
But be careful.

1495
02:13:58,238 --> 02:14:00,173
Cyrus wants you to
become a war junkie.

1496
02:14:00,307 --> 02:14:01,809
So don't get too much at home.

1497
02:14:01,943 --> 02:14:04,478
You got Gabi to think about.

1498
02:14:07,347 --> 02:14:08,716
- Where are you in all of this?

1499
02:14:08,850 --> 02:14:10,217
- I'm leaving.

1500
02:14:11,619 --> 02:14:14,254
That's what
I wanted to tell you,

1501
02:14:14,388 --> 02:14:16,189
I'm going, tonight.

1502
02:14:17,959 --> 02:14:19,159
- Going where?

1503
02:14:22,664 --> 02:14:24,364
- Just going.

1504
02:14:27,969 --> 02:14:29,771
- I don't want you to.

1505
02:14:31,940 --> 02:14:32,774
- I know.

1506
02:14:40,682 --> 02:14:41,516
- I, um,

1507
02:14:43,051 --> 02:14:44,418
I did some digging.

1508
02:14:44,552 --> 02:14:47,254
I know you didn't ask,
but I figured,

1509
02:14:47,387 --> 02:14:48,322
figured, what the hell?

1510
02:14:48,455 --> 02:14:49,791
You never know.

1511
02:14:51,091 --> 02:14:52,860
- You never do.

1512
02:14:58,800 --> 02:15:02,102
- She did look for you,
by the way.

1513
02:15:03,037 --> 02:15:04,539
She looked hard.

1514
02:15:05,640 --> 02:15:08,543
You know, private
investigators, APBs, flyers,

1515
02:15:08,676 --> 02:15:13,380
community service, local cop
said she drove him crazy.

1516
02:15:14,616 --> 02:15:16,985
After five years, it went cold,

1517
02:15:17,117 --> 02:15:18,586
and she moved away.

1518
02:15:25,359 --> 02:15:26,393
- Yeah.

1519
02:15:30,397 --> 02:15:31,431
Thank you.

1520
02:15:33,735 --> 02:15:34,736
I mean that.

1521
02:16:06,768 --> 02:16:10,605
Even though I don't believe
in any of your shit,

1522
02:16:10,738 --> 02:16:13,808
I'd play Mary Magdalene
just to get you off.

1523
02:16:13,941 --> 02:16:14,776
And I would.

1524
02:16:17,712 --> 02:16:19,814
Might even take a little blood.

1525
02:16:26,319 --> 02:16:28,790
But I'd give you as good, man.

1526
02:16:29,824 --> 02:16:30,858
I really would.

1527
02:16:39,734 --> 02:16:42,302
Now do me a favor, Coyote.

1528
02:16:44,471 --> 02:16:46,641
And let me go.

1529
02:16:58,251 --> 02:16:59,821
- Take care, okay?

1530
02:20:22,023 --> 02:20:22,857
- Relax.

1531
02:20:24,592 --> 02:20:25,626
Finish up.

1532
02:20:36,070 --> 02:20:37,838
Put your hands up.

1533
02:20:42,810 --> 02:20:44,211
Walk out the door.

1534
02:21:00,728 --> 02:21:02,462
Forget about it.

1535
02:21:14,976 --> 02:21:15,876
Sit down.

1536
02:21:34,228 --> 02:21:36,864
- What's with
all the fucking drama, girl?

1537
02:21:36,998 --> 02:21:40,668
Why not just do me
while I'm pissing?

1538
02:21:40,801 --> 02:21:43,503
We're in the heart of
true country, so come on.

1539
02:21:43,637 --> 02:21:44,872
Send me home.

1540
02:21:46,707 --> 02:21:47,875
Oh, I get it.

1541
02:21:48,976 --> 02:21:50,678
You want to see if the
cock's feet are made of clay.

1542
02:21:50,811 --> 02:21:52,546
Right, field hand?

1543
02:21:52,680 --> 02:21:55,549
That prince must fall shit?

1544
02:21:55,683 --> 02:21:57,651
Not happening, coolie.

1545
02:21:57,785 --> 02:22:00,421
I'm not like those sheep
whose whore you are.

1546
02:22:00,554 --> 02:22:02,056
I don't pretend to be.

1547
02:22:02,189 --> 02:22:03,924
I am my freedom.

1548
02:22:04,058 --> 02:22:04,992
I wear it.

1549
02:22:05,126 --> 02:22:06,727
You are nothing.

1550
02:22:06,861 --> 02:22:10,998
You're just trying to buy
yourself back with one bullet.

1551
02:22:13,868 --> 02:22:15,870
- You're crossing over.

1552
02:22:16,771 --> 02:22:20,207
And a part of me
is going with you.

1553
02:23:20,501 --> 02:23:23,337
- Officer, Hightower?

1554
02:23:23,471 --> 02:23:24,872
- What's this all about?

1555
02:23:26,774 --> 02:23:29,043
- We get this weird from a woman

1556
02:23:29,176 --> 02:23:31,580
said to come out
to this address,

1557
02:23:31,712 --> 02:23:35,082
Said there'd been a murder
and she gave us your name.

1558
02:23:36,050 --> 02:23:38,419
Said you could identify
the victim as the man

1559
02:23:38,553 --> 02:23:41,722
who kidnapped your daughter.

1560
02:23:46,193 --> 02:23:48,896
Is this the man?

1561
02:23:52,900 --> 02:23:55,669
- Yeah, that's him.

1562
02:27:12,866 --> 02:27:15,269
- Where is it?

1563
02:27:21,275 --> 02:27:22,109
Yes!

1564
02:27:24,912 --> 02:27:25,946
Hello?

1565
02:27:28,916 --> 02:27:30,552
- Hey, Coyote.

1566
02:27:39,259 --> 02:27:42,062
- Case, where the fuck are you?

1567
02:27:44,898 --> 02:27:46,400
- I'm here.
