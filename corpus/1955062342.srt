1
00:02:43,960 --> 00:02:47,726
<i>Ah, the holidays.
The most wonderful time of the year.</i>

2
00:02:49,960 --> 00:02:51,883
<i>And so, begins my tale.</i>

3
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:56,004
<i>On the snowy morning
of Christmas Eve,</i>

4
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,402
<i>as Charlotte Cooper
set out her 37th snow globe,</i>

5
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:02,802
<i>trying to create
the perfect Christmas for her family,</i>

6
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:06,885
<i>she remembered a moment,
she'd hoped she could hold on to forever.</i>

7
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:15,728
<i>Meanwhile, her husband, Sam Cooper,
who I can read pretty well,</i>

8
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:19,322
<i>was recalling the moment
just after that moment...</i>

9
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,449
<i>trying to remember
if he knew he was happy,</i>

10
00:03:22,520 --> 00:03:24,841
<i>at the same time,
the happiness was going on.</i>

11
00:03:28,520 --> 00:03:30,284
<i>And their beloved dog, Rags,</i>

12
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:33,409
<i>remembered how good it felt to be
a Christmas present.</i>

13
00:03:43,160 --> 00:03:45,162
<i>And all over town,</i>

14
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:48,722
<i>the Cooper clan, and then some,
were starting their morning too.</i>

15
00:03:48,800 --> 00:03:50,882
<i>Who are all these people?</i>

16
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,331
<i>Well, that's the story.</i>

17
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:54,482
<i>I can't just give it away.</i>

18
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,244
<i>But for now,
they're heading into their holiday,</i>

19
00:03:56,320 --> 00:03:58,721
<i>searching for comfort
and a little more joy.</i>

20
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:00,205
That's fine.
That's fine.

21
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:01,645
All right.
Make gingerbread houses.

22
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:03,364
Can you just have them at
my front door at 9:00 am?

23
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:05,761
Yeah, but it's Christmas morning.
What if they want to sleep in?

24
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:07,126
What kid sleeps in
on Christmas morning?

25
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,247
I don't know.

26
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:09,810
Why do you have
to change things?

27
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:11,405
God forbid, I wanna spend
another 15 minutes with my kids.

28
00:04:11,520 --> 00:04:13,124
Why do you have
to be such a dick?

29
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:19,050
Merry Christmas.
Season's greetings.

30
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,406
Merry Christmas.

31
00:04:20,480 --> 00:04:22,240
We hope to
see you tonight, Angie.

32
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,289
Hey, Charlie,
Merry Christmas. Shh!

33
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:29,205
Don't take that personally.

34
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,408
Take it as a group,
he hates everybody.

35
00:04:31,480 --> 00:04:33,323
Hi, Grandma.
Hi, Grandpa.

36
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,641
Merry Christmas, Bo.
Bo! Merry Christmas.

37
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:38,485
Charlie, please don't
ditch your brother at the mall.

38
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,211
Thank you for taking Madison today.
I really appreciate it.

39
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,520
I can't be late for work.

40
00:04:42,600 --> 00:04:43,931
But it's Christmas eve, Hank.
Come on.

41
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:45,126
Yeah, I know.

42
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:46,690
Job's a job, right?

43
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:49,040
Um...

44
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:50,690
Madison's been doing
this weird thing.

45
00:04:50,760 --> 00:04:52,967
And I made the mistake
of laughing at it the first time.

46
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,565
So, now she does it
all the time.

47
00:04:54,640 --> 00:04:57,484
Do me a favor.
When she does it, don't laugh.

48
00:04:57,560 --> 00:05:00,211
And then, hopefully,
she'll just stop doing it on her own.

49
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:01,810
Sure. Of course.
What is it?

50
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:03,882
- Hi!
- Hi, Madison.

51
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:05,803
There she is.

52
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:07,405
Grandma and Grandpa are here,
they're going to take you for the day.

53
00:05:07,480 --> 00:05:08,641
Can you say, "Hi"?

54
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,881
You're such a dick.

55
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,124
Dad, don't.
Stop it.

56
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:19,204
Okay, let's go.

57
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,602
<i>As Ruby served
her 19th Holiday Special,</i>

58
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,127
<i>she remembered serving
Christmas dinner to her brothers.</i>

59
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,283
<i>While her mother,
six eggnogs to the wind,</i>

60
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:32,842
<i>was passed out on the couch.</i>

61
00:05:32,920 --> 00:05:36,720
<i>Although her childhood had
left her feeling separate from the world,</i>

62
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,725
<i>Ruby felt an unexpected
connection to Bucky Newport.</i>

63
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:42,643
<i>For the last five years,</i>

64
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,927
<i>she looked forward to
starting her mornings with him.</i>

65
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:48,368
<i>She loved how he wore
a suit and bow tie, every day,</i>

66
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,568
<i>just like did
when he was a teacher.</i>

67
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:53,723
<i>Always straightening it
and only making it worse.</i>

68
00:05:58,480 --> 00:06:01,006
Good morning.
I'm furious with you.

69
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:03,046
What'd I do?

70
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:04,360
That ending shattered me.

71
00:06:04,440 --> 00:06:05,885
Well, it's supposed to.

72
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:07,530
That's what makes it one of
the most significant endings

73
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:08,840
in the history of film.

74
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,285
But Chaplin's face...

75
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,010
<i>Full of hope and fear</i>

76
00:06:13,080 --> 00:06:15,811
<i>and shame and embarrassment
and God knows what else.</i>

77
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:19,680
But the genius was that it's his
subconscious autobiography.

78
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:21,649
He had fallen in love
with several

79
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,769
young women over the years
and he was their mentor.

80
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:26,569
But he was endlessly
terrified that

81
00:06:26,640 --> 00:06:28,324
they're going see him
as he saw himself.

82
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,927
Which is nothing but a busker,
in the streets of London.

83
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,240
It's amazing.

84
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:36,404
<i>Bucky looked away
from Ruby because,</i>

85
00:06:36,480 --> 00:06:40,007
<i>oddly, he felt closer to her
than anyone in his life.</i>

86
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,606
<i>He understood the absurdity
of the situation.</i>

87
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:45,843
<i>He had shown her 67 movies.
Ate at her diner, daily.</i>

88
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:47,843
<i>And hated the food there.</i>

89
00:06:47,920 --> 00:06:48,967
You want the special?

90
00:06:49,040 --> 00:06:50,121
Uh...

91
00:06:50,200 --> 00:06:51,929
What day is today?
Friday.

92
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,367
Friday?
It's not so special.

93
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:56,766
How about Wednesday's?

94
00:06:56,840 --> 00:06:58,649
Or Thursday's hash browns?

95
00:06:58,720 --> 00:07:00,051
- Sold.
- Hey, Ruby.

96
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:02,645
The Coffee's cold.

97
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:03,846
You'll be fine.

98
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:05,487
Sit down.

99
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:08,484
Spending Christmas
with the family?

100
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:10,801
<i>Ruby recalled the joys
of gift giving.</i>

101
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:14,007
Nope.

102
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,090
Believe me, I understand.

103
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:19,322
Christmas comes around,
somebody yells,

104
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:22,165
"Time for comfort and joy,
it's Christmas."

105
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,210
Everybody panics as if
you can schedule happiness.

106
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:26,406
Can't do it.

107
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:27,845
You going to your daughter's?

108
00:07:27,920 --> 00:07:30,730
Oh, yes.
She's a very good cook.

109
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,290
I don't know where
she got it from, because

110
00:07:32,360 --> 00:07:35,170
when their mother died,
the only thing I could teach her was

111
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:37,004
how to order out.

112
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:39,811
I don't know what it is.
Everything is a contest with my girls.

113
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:41,848
Except I have no idea
what the prize is.

114
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:45,720
I try to ease the tension,
but they don't really hear me.

115
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,404
Hey, Ruby,
my coffee's still cold.

116
00:07:47,480 --> 00:07:49,200
Why don't you come over
here and warm me up?

117
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,484
Sorry, I got to go.

118
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:55,164
Clearly, an emergency.

119
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,961
I just don't feel like
spending any money on her.

120
00:08:06,040 --> 00:08:08,088
She never spends a dime on me.

121
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,928
My own sister. Oh!

122
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:14,129
You know what she'll do.
She'll make a donation in my name.

123
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,043
Oh, that's really festive.

124
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:19,249
And they never say
how big a donation,

125
00:08:19,320 --> 00:08:23,962
so there's no way of knowing
how much I'm supposed to spend.

126
00:08:24,040 --> 00:08:28,409
I am tempted to get
the rattiest thing I can find,

127
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:30,767
just to see
my sister Charlotte's face.

128
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:32,968
Hold on.
I'll call you back.

129
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:46,927
<i>When Emma was a little girl,</i>

130
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,924
<i>she overheard her parents say
that her sister, Charlotte, was planned,</i>

131
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,684
<i>but that she was an accident.</i>

132
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,810
<i>She faithfully behaved
like one, ever since.</i>

133
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,770
Ma'am, ma'am,
we need to detain you.

134
00:08:59,840 --> 00:09:02,241
Give it to me.

135
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:04,607
Come on. Let's just make
life easier on everybody.

136
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:06,527
Spit it out.

137
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,521
Spit it out.

138
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:10,691
Give it to me.

139
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:20,606
Merry Christmas.

140
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:22,682
Thank you so much.
Thank you. Best ever.

141
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:23,886
Thank you.

142
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,809
Our last number

143
00:09:25,880 --> 00:09:28,724
is one of my aunt's favorites.
So, this is for you.

144
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:29,801
Aunt Fishy.

145
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:32,484
Rags! Get down, Rags.

146
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:36,807
Okay, then.
Ready, Mrs. Pinkins?

147
00:09:36,880 --> 00:09:38,166
Hit it.

148
00:09:38,240 --> 00:09:43,121
<i>♪ Joy to the world
The Lord has come</i>

149
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,201
<i>♪ Let earth... ♪</i>

150
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:46,601
That's not the right lyric.

151
00:09:46,680 --> 00:09:49,763
I'm sorry, Mitzi,
but I think it is.

152
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:51,524
From the top, please.

153
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,570
I'm not going to play to the wrong lyric.

154
00:09:54,640 --> 00:09:55,880
Don't play it, Mitzi.

155
00:09:56,520 --> 00:09:58,045
Mitzi's right.

156
00:09:58,120 --> 00:09:59,565
It's not the right lyric.
Of course it's the lyric.

157
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,290
Joy to the world,
the Lord has come.

158
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:04,409
No, it's not the Lord has come,
like God reached orgasm. Please...

159
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:06,880
What?

160
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:10,481
Mitzi!

161
00:10:11,840 --> 00:10:14,081
Well, so, Merry Christmas,
everyone.

162
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:16,162
I think that ends
our little program.

163
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:18,481
Thank you so much.
You've been a wonderful audience.

164
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:19,925
We will be back next year.

165
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:21,411
But will they?

166
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,125
Yeah, you don't have to worry about
that after tonight, that's for sure.

167
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,770
You don't have to say it
like you're never

168
00:10:27,840 --> 00:10:30,207
going to see me again,
Charlotte. I'm not dying.

169
00:10:30,280 --> 00:10:31,725
No. But we are.

170
00:10:35,640 --> 00:10:36,766
Hey, Tinkerbell.

171
00:10:41,640 --> 00:10:44,723
<i>Aware of the growing distance
between her parents,</i>

172
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,486
<i>Eleanor Cooper found herself
drawn to public displays of affection.</i>

173
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,161
<i>She remembered a time in her life
she had not been so guarded.</i>

174
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:02,005
This is quite fun.

175
00:11:02,080 --> 00:11:05,163
If you show me yours,
I'll show you mine.

176
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:06,801
Okay?

177
00:11:17,080 --> 00:11:18,650
Oh.

178
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,362
<i>She remembered a moment
she'd wished she could forget,</i>

179
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,046
<i>the day a stolen kiss
caught her eye.</i>

180
00:11:28,120 --> 00:11:30,521
<i>She recognized that kiss.</i>

181
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,728
<i>It was her fiancé's.</i>

182
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,009
<i>Eleanor was shattered.</i>

183
00:11:36,080 --> 00:11:41,120
<i>Alas, she could never climb
the wall that built up around her heart.</i>

184
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,841
<i>Still, Eleanor secretly
searched out strangers' faces</i>

185
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:47,685
<i>for the moment they flickered
with unguarded emotion.</i>

186
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:58,527
Can I have a Dirty Martini,
shaken over ice, please?

187
00:11:58,600 --> 00:11:59,806
I'd be honored
to buy you a drink.

188
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:01,120
I can pay for my own drink,
thank you.

189
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:02,321
Not you.

190
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,245
Thanks.

191
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,000
I'll have a Dirty Martini,
shaken over ice.

192
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:13,284
Put the presents
for the kids in the trunk.

193
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:15,886
And I'll get
your tip next time.

194
00:12:15,960 --> 00:12:17,405
No problem.

195
00:12:17,480 --> 00:12:19,562
And take the Internet,
it's faster.

196
00:12:19,640 --> 00:12:21,130
You got it, Aunt Fishy.

197
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:23,487
My nephew
called me that.

198
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:25,528
He and wife
are going to Africa

199
00:12:25,640 --> 00:12:27,529
and I'm babysitting the kids.

200
00:12:27,640 --> 00:12:29,881
I'm your nephew.
Can you remember my name?

201
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,130
Um...

202
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:35,126
Sam.

203
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:37,885
Yes. I'm Sam,
that's great.

204
00:12:37,960 --> 00:12:40,088
I know your name.

205
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:42,288
I'm not a zombie.

206
00:12:42,360 --> 00:12:43,805
You better step on it.

207
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:45,803
You're going to
miss your plane.

208
00:12:45,880 --> 00:12:47,928
Aunt Fishy,
that was 30 years ago.

209
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:49,570
Really?

210
00:12:49,640 --> 00:12:51,290
Well, how was the trip?

211
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,044
We didn't go.

212
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,521
Well, you were dying to go.

213
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:00,208
And you and Charlotte,
saved your money for years.

214
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:03,250
We had a rough year,
so we postponed it.

215
00:13:03,320 --> 00:13:06,802
Oh, Sammy.
And then you never went.

216
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:09,087
Weren't you supposed to go,
again this year?

217
00:13:12,080 --> 00:13:13,844
Yes, we were.

218
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,968
<i>Who can say
what ends a marriage?</i>

219
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,203
<i>Perhaps it's unreasonable
to ask human beings to grow at exactly</i>

220
00:13:19,280 --> 00:13:23,365
<i>the same rate for 40 years,
six months and three days.</i>

221
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,205
<i>But the canceled trip
was the last straw.</i>

222
00:13:26,280 --> 00:13:29,409
<i>And Sam was moving out.</i>

223
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,246
You seem out of sorts.
Give me the keys, I'll drive.

224
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:38,645
<i>As Hank Cooper waited
for his 17th job interview</i>

225
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,245
<i>in the past month,</i>

226
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,288
<i>he wondered how long
he could keep up</i>

227
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:45,523
<i>the lie that he was
still taking family portraits at Sears.</i>

228
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,284
Big smiles, guys.

229
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:48,850
You're going to have
this picture for the rest of your lives.

230
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:51,161
It's going on a wall.
All right, right here. Ready?

231
00:13:53,640 --> 00:13:55,608
Oh! Yes.

232
00:13:55,680 --> 00:13:58,047
<i>He missed his job helping
unhappy families appear happy.</i>

233
00:13:58,120 --> 00:14:00,441
Love the sweaters,
right? Chipper.

234
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,447
Yes. And that's beautiful.

235
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,806
<i>It was his superpower.</i>

236
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:09,323
<i>Unexpectedly,</i>

237
00:14:09,400 --> 00:14:13,803
<i>he thought of a woman
he saw just once and never again.</i>

238
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,770
<i>Then he thought of the automated
voice that had replaced him.</i>

239
00:14:16,840 --> 00:14:21,767
<i>Merry Christmas.
Toes on the line. Cheese.</i>

240
00:14:21,880 --> 00:14:24,167
<i>Did that voice have children?</i>

241
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:27,722
<i>Did they now have unaffordable
gifts on their Christmas lists, too?</i>

242
00:14:27,800 --> 00:14:31,725
Dear Santa, please
bring me a blue bicycle.

243
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:36,727
I'll be waking up at my father's,
but opening presents at my mom's.

244
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:40,088
<i>Hank thought of the unbridled
joy he had Christmas mornings.</i>

245
00:14:42,040 --> 00:14:43,485
Mister Cooper?

246
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:53,170
<i>Determined, Hank entered
the office with his left foot.</i>

247
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:55,288
<i>He'd read this was lucky.</i>

248
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,328
I want to thank you for taking
the time to speak with me today.

249
00:14:57,400 --> 00:14:59,129
I really appreciate it.

250
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,531
I know that you're not actually
hiring anyone till the new year,

251
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,840
but just know that...

252
00:15:02,680 --> 00:15:04,250
I'm ready to work now.

253
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,802
You know, I could start today
if you needed it.

254
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:09,245
I take pride in my work.

255
00:15:09,320 --> 00:15:11,209
I take a lot of pride
in my work. I...

256
00:15:11,280 --> 00:15:14,807
At my last job, if a family took a bad picture,
I insisted on taking another,

257
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:17,645
because I care.
I care. I just...

258
00:15:17,720 --> 00:15:20,200
I hated the idea
of anyone sending out

259
00:15:20,280 --> 00:15:21,850
a bad holiday card.

260
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,969
You know, you don't get another
shot at that for a whole year.

261
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:27,008
You know how many relatives
are going to see that?

262
00:15:27,080 --> 00:15:28,764
Who's going to care
about that now, Bob?

263
00:15:28,840 --> 00:15:30,080
Who's going to care about that?

264
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,206
Dude, you are way too
intense for Staples.

265
00:15:46,280 --> 00:15:47,600
So what your deal?
What do you do?

266
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,210
I am a writer.

267
00:15:50,280 --> 00:15:52,089
Oh! Wow. All right.

268
00:15:52,160 --> 00:15:54,288
What do you write?

269
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,488
<i>Are you familiar with the Pottery Barn Catalog,
Outdoor Furniture Edition?</i>

270
00:15:57,200 --> 00:15:58,326
All-weather wicker.

271
00:15:58,400 --> 00:16:00,050
You know my work?

272
00:16:02,280 --> 00:16:04,521
I write plays, actually.
I don't know why... Yeah.

273
00:16:04,600 --> 00:16:06,523
Wow. That's cool.
Yeah.

274
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,204
My last play was
almost produced.

275
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:11,164
And then...

276
00:16:12,520 --> 00:16:15,285
...my lead actor
slash ventriloquist

277
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:17,571
left for a paying job.

278
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,210
He was a Republican,
naturally.

279
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,285
Republican ventriloquist.

280
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:27,450
Oh, no. No.

281
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,602
You're way too cute
to be a Republican.

282
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,250
Ah.

283
00:16:31,320 --> 00:16:34,210
Well, the good news is
I'm not a ventriloquist.

284
00:16:34,280 --> 00:16:36,408
Just tell me you're not one
of those churchy Republicans,

285
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,280
who believes in Fox News,
but not evolution.

286
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:43,762
Okay. If man evolved
from monkeys and apes,

287
00:16:43,840 --> 00:16:46,571
why are there still,
monkeys and apes?

288
00:16:46,640 --> 00:16:49,530
It's funny because my dog asked me
the same thing about wolves yesterday.

289
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:51,443
All right.

290
00:16:51,520 --> 00:16:52,760
Look, you believe
in God, right?

291
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:54,086
Which one?

292
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:56,168
Any one, just pick one.

293
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:58,527
They all need too much
validation for me.

294
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,082
It's all, "Love me most
or go to hell."

295
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,050
I have a hard time believing
I'm less needy than God.

296
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:07,327
Yeah, I have a hard time
believing you are too.

297
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:10,240
So you don't believe
in much, do you?

298
00:17:10,320 --> 00:17:12,482
You know
what I believe in?

299
00:17:12,560 --> 00:17:17,168
I believe in the sound
of Nina Simone's voice.

300
00:17:17,240 --> 00:17:20,687
I feel like that is the closest
I'll ever come to believing in God.

301
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,568
I haven't heard her.
Wow.

302
00:17:26,240 --> 00:17:27,765
Sorry.

303
00:17:27,840 --> 00:17:29,251
It'll make you a convert.

304
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:35,329
What are you doing
in an airport bar anyway?

305
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:38,006
Shouldn't you be with your people
in denying science,

306
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,923
or wherever
you're from?

307
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,083
I'm just trying to get home,
but everything's snowed in.

308
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:44,480
Isn't that what
you're doing here?

309
00:17:44,520 --> 00:17:47,842
No, I flew in
to see my family.

310
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,689
I have to be there
at 5:00.

311
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:52,127
I'm just here to kill
an hour or six.

312
00:17:53,920 --> 00:17:55,001
All right.

313
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,883
Hey. Whoops.

314
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:01,486
I hope Eleanor's
plane wasn't delayed.

315
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:03,090
And something's up with Hank.

316
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:04,889
He always does that
weird piglet snort

317
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:06,689
whenever he's trying
to hide something.

318
00:18:06,760 --> 00:18:08,125
People snort, Charlotte.

319
00:18:08,200 --> 00:18:10,965
No. This is not a universal snort,
like.

320
00:18:11,040 --> 00:18:13,611
It's not.
It's a kind of a... It's...

321
00:18:13,680 --> 00:18:15,808
It's specific like.

322
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,326
It's...

323
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:21,165
Merry Christmas.
Anyway. All right.

324
00:18:21,240 --> 00:18:22,605
Well...
Oh, my goodness, look.

325
00:18:22,680 --> 00:18:24,330
Oh, I've got a surprise
for you, Madison.

326
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:27,643
This is genuine,
guess what. Look.

327
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:31,010
Gingerbread house.
Yes.

328
00:18:34,440 --> 00:18:36,283
Maybe I should bake
a peppermint cake.

329
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:38,362
- Why?
- Because it's Christmas, Sam.

330
00:18:38,440 --> 00:18:40,522
For God's sake,
it's Christmas.

331
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:42,040
You can't cook this away,
Charlotte.

332
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,809
People are going to look back
on tonight and realize

333
00:18:43,880 --> 00:18:45,803
it was all a performance.
We should have, at least,

334
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:47,564
warned them
before they came.

335
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:50,530
No, but I want them to wanna come,
that's the whole point.

336
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,568
This is the only time of the
year when we're all together.

337
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:54,324
And it's our last chance

338
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:56,289
to feel like a family
before we tell them.

339
00:18:56,360 --> 00:18:57,725
I want the kids

340
00:18:57,800 --> 00:19:00,485
to have the memory
of one last perfect Christmas.

341
00:19:00,560 --> 00:19:02,608
And I know that you think
that I'm ridiculous...

342
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:04,409
No, I don't think
you're being ridiculous.

343
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:06,721
Under the circumstances, yeah,
you are being a little ridiculous.

344
00:19:06,800 --> 00:19:09,644
<i>♪ ...Comfort and joy
Comfort and joy</i>

345
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,248
<i>♪ Oh, tidings
Of comfort and joy ♪</i>

346
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:16,641
We clearly have a major
difference of opinion

347
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,688
and I can understand
why you are wrong.

348
00:19:18,800 --> 00:19:20,484
If you treat them
like they're not resilient,

349
00:19:20,560 --> 00:19:21,971
they're going to be
not resilient.

350
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:23,929
Hank is still reeling
from the divorce...

351
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,002
and you know...
I'm sorry, okay, go ahead.

352
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:27,081
No, you go ahead.
I'll listen.

353
00:19:27,160 --> 00:19:28,810
Well...
I feel like a fraud.

354
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:30,882
The whole thing feels wrong.
I'm going to tell them the truth.

355
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:32,200
We'll all be together.
Wait a minute.

356
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:33,611
No, we made an agreement.

357
00:19:33,680 --> 00:19:35,489
You cannot break an agreement,
mid-agreement.

358
00:19:35,560 --> 00:19:37,449
I disagree.
No, you agreed to the agreement.

359
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:39,170
You agreed to one
last Christmas

360
00:19:39,280 --> 00:19:40,691
and then you can
just move out.

361
00:19:40,760 --> 00:19:42,205
You want to leave,
you can just go ahead and leave.

362
00:19:42,280 --> 00:19:44,647
Hold on, you're the one
who chose not to go.

363
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:46,680
You don't care enough about
the marriage to make...

364
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:49,849
<i>Will the parents of the
lost child in aisle seven</i>

365
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:52,730
<i>Please come up
to the front and claim her?</i>

366
00:19:52,800 --> 00:19:54,165
<i>You're such a dick.</i>

367
00:19:54,240 --> 00:19:56,322
Oh, my God.

368
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:00,207
<i>Bo was on a mission.</i>

369
00:20:00,280 --> 00:20:03,409
<i>He had to find the perfect
gift that would bring back his brother,</i>

370
00:20:03,480 --> 00:20:06,051
<i>who had become an alien
since his parents' divorce.</i>

371
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,721
<i>That gift had to have
healing powers</i>

372
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,882
<i>and it had to be cheap.</i>

373
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,526
<i>He even sacrificed
his one-on-one with Santa.</i>

374
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:34,209
<i>Nothing about this mission
was easy.</i>

375
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:36,442
<i>But Bo would not be thwarted.</i>

376
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:39,364
This is a whole
misunderstanding.

377
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:42,244
Look, I'm somebody's mother.

378
00:20:42,320 --> 00:20:43,765
I have three kids.
They're teenagers.

379
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:44,966
They're teenagers.

380
00:20:45,040 --> 00:20:47,646
Already, they don't
take me seriously.

381
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:49,722
My husband's
an ethics professor.

382
00:20:49,800 --> 00:20:51,643
He'll never forgive me.

383
00:20:51,720 --> 00:20:54,371
My entire family is coming over at 5:00
for Christmas dinner,

384
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:55,766
which I have to cook.

385
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:58,889
Please. Don't you have
any compassion?

386
00:20:58,960 --> 00:21:00,564
So, it's all a misunderstanding?

387
00:21:00,640 --> 00:21:03,610
Yes.
Okay. So, clear it up.

388
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,040
How'd the jewels
get in your mouth?

389
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:08,691
Right. This way.

390
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:09,921
I though it was a lozenge.

391
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:13,927
<i>Shortly after his mother
moved out,</i>

392
00:21:14,040 --> 00:21:16,725
<i>Charlie felt as unclaimed
as a lost Christmas package,</i>

393
00:21:16,800 --> 00:21:18,882
<i>lying in the back corner
of the post office.</i>

394
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:21,889
<i>In spite of this,</i>

395
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:24,611
<i>he arrived at the mall,
vowing he would kiss Lauren Hesselberg,</i>

396
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:26,961
<i>once and for all,
or die trying.</i>

397
00:21:55,720 --> 00:21:57,848
<i>Unnerved, he began
to watch himself.</i>

398
00:22:00,160 --> 00:22:02,401
<i>He told himself to coolly say,</i>

399
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,165
<i>"What's up, Lauren?
What's up?"</i>

400
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:07,360
Hey, Lauren.

401
00:22:10,520 --> 00:22:11,681
Hey, Charlie.

402
00:22:13,880 --> 00:22:15,041
What you doing here?

403
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:16,531
I, I work here.

404
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:20,483
Of course.

405
00:22:22,120 --> 00:22:23,929
<i>When, at last, he stood
in front of her,</i>

406
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:26,571
<i>a clear directive repeated
itself in his mind,</i>

407
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:29,285
<i>"Don't look at her boobs.</i>

408
00:22:30,640 --> 00:22:32,927
<i>"Do not look at her boobs."</i>

409
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:49,929
I love the way Stewart does a little
food dance when his meal arrives.

410
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:54,401
And how Sarah still puts
lipstick on for Hal.

411
00:22:57,080 --> 00:22:59,845
I like the way Paula Anderson
rests her breasts on the table,

412
00:22:59,920 --> 00:23:01,285
as if they were tired.

413
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:08,926
We were so sad to see you go,
Ruby. I'm gonna miss you.

414
00:23:12,440 --> 00:23:13,566
Take care, okay?

415
00:23:13,640 --> 00:23:15,244
- Merry Christmas.
- Bye, guys.

416
00:23:15,320 --> 00:23:16,924
You're going somewhere?

417
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:23,406
It's my last day.

418
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:27,282
What?
Yeah.

419
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:30,250
You tell the lady with the lipstick on
her teeth and you don't tell me?

420
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:32,561
I don't...
I didn't know how to tell you.

421
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:37,081
It's like that movie you gave
me, <i>Born Yesterday,</i> right,

422
00:23:37,160 --> 00:23:39,731
when Billie Dawn walks
out on Harry Brock.

423
00:23:39,800 --> 00:23:42,007
There's a better
kind of life than the one I got.

424
00:23:43,600 --> 00:23:46,365
You told me,
right here, you said,

425
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:50,126
"Starting over, you could
be the hero of your own life."

426
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:51,685
You can be a hero, here.

427
00:23:51,760 --> 00:23:54,491
Where are you going?

428
00:23:54,560 --> 00:23:56,130
Hot Coffee, Mississippi.

429
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:58,168
I found it on a map
when I was 14 years old.

430
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:01,005
It seems like the perfect place
for a waitress.

431
00:24:01,080 --> 00:24:03,048
Look, I don't understand.
I'm confused.

432
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:06,886
You've never even been there.
It's the worst idea I've ever heard of.

433
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,169
But I... I want to start over.
I need...

434
00:24:10,920 --> 00:24:12,331
I need a change.

435
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:14,767
No, no, no, no.
Leaving doesn't change anything.

436
00:24:14,840 --> 00:24:16,490
Everything just
comes with you.

437
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,045
Hot Coffee, Mississippi?

438
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:20,202
That's a place?
It's like a line from a sitcom.

439
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:21,725
Bucky.

440
00:24:21,800 --> 00:24:23,802
You're a bird watcher.
You watch us all from a distance.

441
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:25,723
We're just characters
that amuse you.

442
00:24:25,800 --> 00:24:28,406
Not true.
You love everybody at arm's length,

443
00:24:28,480 --> 00:24:30,323
keep it up and you'll
end up alone, Ruby.

444
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:32,129
That's a terrible thing
to say to me.

445
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:33,605
Well, it's a terrible
thing to watch.

446
00:24:33,680 --> 00:24:35,091
It's very cowardly.

447
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,646
So, in other words,
you think that I'm a coward.

448
00:24:37,720 --> 00:24:41,122
No. Not in other words,
those are the words.

449
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:43,680
You think you can run away,
hiding in Hot Chocolate?

450
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:45,444
You're a coward.

451
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:46,646
You can pay up front.

452
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:52,960
You tell everybody at the restaurant
you're leaving and you don't tell me.

453
00:25:37,280 --> 00:25:38,486
May I ask you something?

454
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:46,211
Is this something that they teach
you at the Police Academy?

455
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,044
Or have you always
been a robot?

456
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:51,368
I can understand

457
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,488
that you need
professional distance

458
00:25:53,560 --> 00:25:55,130
from a hardened criminal.

459
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,723
But when there's a poor,
downtrodden housewife,

460
00:25:59,800 --> 00:26:02,451
sobbing in the back
of your car on Christmas,

461
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:04,124
one has to wonder.

462
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,283
I'm guessing it's something
they teach you.

463
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,689
No one's born that way.

464
00:26:12,800 --> 00:26:15,087
<i>Though Officer Williams never
engaged with suspects</i>

465
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:16,366
<i>in the back of his car,</i>

466
00:26:16,440 --> 00:26:18,522
<i>Emma unknowingly
pierced his armor.</i>

467
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,250
I'm not a robot.

468
00:26:24,040 --> 00:26:25,201
What?

469
00:26:25,280 --> 00:26:27,328
I have feelings, just
like everyone else.

470
00:26:29,520 --> 00:26:30,965
Would you like
to talk about it?

471
00:26:31,040 --> 00:26:32,530
I'm not talking to you.

472
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:34,489
Take me to your leader.
Shut up.

473
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:38,081
Listen.

474
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:41,921
You landed in a pot of jam,
arresting me.

475
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:45,561
I've been a doctor
for 20 years.

476
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:47,961
People pay me a lot
to listen to their problems.

477
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:55,611
You're a head-shrinker?

478
00:26:55,680 --> 00:26:58,160
<i>What Emma did not know
was that Officer Williams</i>

479
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:00,129
had once sought out counseling,

480
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:02,965
<i>but couldn't get over the fact
that he would have to talk.</i>

481
00:27:09,960 --> 00:27:14,761
And we're off, with Rudolph,
right here, to see Santa.

482
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:16,604
And Donner, and Vixen...

483
00:27:16,680 --> 00:27:18,682
And Blitzen and Nixon...

484
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:23,170
Look at this.
It's beautiful.

485
00:27:33,960 --> 00:27:36,691
Silent Night <i>reminded
Charlotte of a part of herself</i>

486
00:27:36,800 --> 00:27:40,122
<i>that now felt inescapably
out of her grasp.</i>

487
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:43,841
<i>She caroled to deflect
the fact that she missed that person...</i>

488
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,604
<i>as much as Sam did.</i>

<i>♪ Mother and child... ♪</i>

492
00:27:57,680 --> 00:27:59,170
What?

493
00:27:59,280 --> 00:28:01,089
Really? You think it's a song about
a brown young virgin?

494
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:02,361
And her mother
and her child.

495
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:03,601
Oh, my God.

496
00:28:03,680 --> 00:28:05,409
I didn't write the song,
Charlotte.

497
00:28:05,480 --> 00:28:07,084
Look, Sam,
I was a music teacher.

498
00:28:07,160 --> 00:28:10,004
Round. That's what it is.
She's a round young virgin.

499
00:28:10,080 --> 00:28:11,969
Yeah, it's much better.
Very Christmassy.

500
00:28:12,800 --> 00:28:14,165
Oh! Oh. Yes.

501
00:28:14,240 --> 00:28:15,401
Don't worry. We're going.

502
00:28:15,480 --> 00:28:17,403
Off we go.
Next stop, where?

503
00:28:17,480 --> 00:28:22,088
To see the one,
the only, Santa.

504
00:28:27,400 --> 00:28:29,641
And Santa's
army of helpers.

505
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:31,324
- Right.
- It's Santa's brothers.

506
00:28:31,400 --> 00:28:34,085
Anta, Janta, Mylanta...

507
00:28:56,520 --> 00:28:59,683
Oh, man,
look at that. They...

508
00:28:59,800 --> 00:29:04,362
I love moments where people are
so unchecked, so unselfconscious.

509
00:29:06,800 --> 00:29:10,361
I know. It's ridiculous.
I like watching people.

510
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:12,283
I just love that moment when

511
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:14,203
a face floods with feeling.

512
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:16,928
Oh, I get it. I do.

513
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,165
All right.

514
00:29:21,280 --> 00:29:23,442
Hit the pool?
Mm-hmm.

515
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,363
Yeah. Oh, God.

516
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:27,920
Where'd you go? Bailey?

517
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:30,606
Bailey?
Oh, God, thank God.

518
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,603
I thought you were gone.
That is very effective camo.

519
00:29:32,680 --> 00:29:34,284
All right.

520
00:29:34,360 --> 00:29:35,800
Did you always want to
join the army?

521
00:29:36,760 --> 00:29:39,161
Uh, it's a long story.

522
00:29:39,240 --> 00:29:40,844
Oh.

523
00:29:40,920 --> 00:29:42,206
Father in the military?

524
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:43,805
Mm-hmm.

525
00:29:43,880 --> 00:29:45,769
Short story, really.

526
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:49,121
It was the right
thing to do.

527
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:50,690
Hey, I admire it.

528
00:29:50,760 --> 00:29:53,969
I can't imagine putting my life
on the line for anything.

529
00:29:54,040 --> 00:29:55,485
What if I was wrong?

530
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:58,131
That certainty,
that's amazing.

531
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,248
Thank you.
In like a...

532
00:30:00,360 --> 00:30:03,523
corporate-loving, government-trusting,
gung-ho kind of way.

533
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:04,726
Uh-huh.

534
00:30:04,800 --> 00:30:07,770
As opposed
to your mistrusting,

535
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:10,810
sideline-hugging,
passive sort of way.

536
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:12,882
Right.
Yeah.

537
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:15,804
How does your family
feel about you leaving?

538
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,087
They're happy I'm finally
getting my life together.

539
00:30:18,160 --> 00:30:19,525
Oh.

540
00:30:19,600 --> 00:30:22,365
Yeah. They haven't seen me
since I looked like...

541
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:25,367
This.

542
00:30:26,960 --> 00:30:28,450
Oh, wow!

543
00:30:28,520 --> 00:30:30,761
That's an extreme
transformation!

544
00:30:30,840 --> 00:30:32,330
That's incredible.
Can I keep this?

545
00:30:32,400 --> 00:30:34,084
I'm going to need
to keep this. Wow!

546
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,121
How long
have you felt robotic?

547
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:44,804
I don't.

548
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:48,089
I see, so you believe
you're in touch with your feelings then?

549
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:50,089
Yes.
Both of them?

550
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:56,726
Apparently...

551
00:30:57,880 --> 00:31:00,360
I...

552
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:03,125
have trouble expressing myself
in relationships.

553
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:05,731
How old are you?

554
00:31:05,840 --> 00:31:06,921
I just turned 40.

555
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:09,968
And, uh,
how's your sex life?

556
00:31:13,360 --> 00:31:14,600
How's your sex life?

557
00:31:14,680 --> 00:31:18,082
I have sex
with people, okay? But...

558
00:31:18,160 --> 00:31:20,640
But you don't connect
emotionally?

559
00:31:20,720 --> 00:31:22,131
And what's
your biggest fear?

560
00:31:23,680 --> 00:31:25,364
I don't want to end up alone.

561
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:28,160
And gay.

562
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,201
What?

563
00:31:32,480 --> 00:31:34,801
You're 40,
you're single.

564
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:36,291
"People" sleep with you?

565
00:31:36,360 --> 00:31:37,646
Are you serious?

566
00:31:38,400 --> 00:31:39,845
Are you gay?
No!

567
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,360
Only in bed.

568
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:15,046
You all right, Grandpa?

569
00:32:15,160 --> 00:32:17,481
Yes, yes, exceptional.
Never better.

570
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:19,881
How did it go?

571
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:22,729
Exceptional.
Never better.

572
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,566
That bad?

573
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:26,688
Yeah, what the hell
am I going to do?

574
00:32:26,760 --> 00:32:28,888
I got to find a job
by the new year.

575
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:30,928
You don't have to find a job
by the new year,

576
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,331
that's an arbitrary deadline.

577
00:32:32,400 --> 00:32:34,243
You can find it January 11th,

578
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:37,085
March 17th,
it makes no difference.

579
00:32:37,160 --> 00:32:38,366
I'll lend you the money.

580
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:40,680
I don't want to be
that guy.

581
00:32:40,760 --> 00:32:43,969
I like that guy,
he's a very fine guy.

582
00:32:44,040 --> 00:32:46,486
Now then, what shall
we get Charlotte?

583
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:49,131
Poinsettias or poinsettias?

584
00:32:49,200 --> 00:32:50,361
How about poinsettias?

585
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,202
Good idea.

586
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:54,805
I got it,
I'll take care of it.

587
00:32:54,880 --> 00:32:56,041
That's all right.
No, no, I got it.

588
00:32:56,160 --> 00:32:57,650
I got it.
I got it!

589
00:32:57,720 --> 00:32:59,529
Let me...
I got the god damned flowers!

590
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:01,686
You get the flowers.

591
00:33:01,760 --> 00:33:03,285
$8.99.

592
00:33:03,360 --> 00:33:05,488
I'll get that
back for you.

593
00:33:05,560 --> 00:33:07,722
Hank, you don't have to hide
this from your family.

594
00:33:08,560 --> 00:33:09,971
They're your family.

595
00:33:10,040 --> 00:33:12,042
I don't want to
ruin Christmas for Mom.

596
00:33:12,120 --> 00:33:15,329
Well, then tell Angie.
She will understand if the alimony is late.

597
00:33:15,400 --> 00:33:18,802
No, I was a failure at marriage.
I refuse to be a failure at divorce.

598
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:22,009
You're not a failure.
Some marriages have a shelf life, that's all.

599
00:33:22,080 --> 00:33:23,923
But you and Angie
were never happy.

600
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:26,680
Angie was always looking over her
shoulder for what she didn't have.

601
00:33:27,200 --> 00:33:28,247
FOMO.

602
00:33:29,880 --> 00:33:32,804
FOMO?
Fear of missing out.

603
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,370
We fought about it
all the time.

604
00:33:34,440 --> 00:33:36,568
Look, I understand.
There's history there,

605
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:38,210
you were high school
sweethearts.

606
00:33:38,280 --> 00:33:40,169
No, that...

607
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,049
That's not true.

608
00:33:42,120 --> 00:33:43,849
We were not sweethearts.
That is family fiction.

609
00:33:43,920 --> 00:33:46,207
We were lab partners.

610
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:48,009
We dissected rats together.

611
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:51,521
Then, out of nowhere...

612
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,605
band practice at Travis Howard's house,
Angie pounced on me...

613
00:33:55,720 --> 00:33:57,529
while
<i>My Sharona was playing.</i>

614
00:33:57,600 --> 00:34:00,604
I got as far as "My, my, my, my,"
and then, boom! Done.

615
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:03,286
I became a dad,
same day I failed Biology.

616
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,125
Listen, don't let this one moment
define your entire life.

617
00:34:06,200 --> 00:34:07,964
I'm telling you this
from the heart now.

618
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:10,805
Angie talks while she chews
with her mouth wide open!

619
00:34:10,880 --> 00:34:12,211
It's like a fireman's hose.

620
00:34:12,320 --> 00:34:13,924
It speaks of her character.

621
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:15,968
She's worse than my Aunt Edna.

622
00:34:16,040 --> 00:34:19,249
Look, Hank,
I had kids young, just like you did.

623
00:34:19,320 --> 00:34:21,926
I had to raise them
while I was still raising myself.

624
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,005
Trust me, this is one small chapter
in your great, big life.

625
00:34:26,080 --> 00:34:27,411
Go out and get some!

626
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:33,644
Just get some?
Get some.

627
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,089
It's... The thing is...

628
00:34:39,160 --> 00:34:40,241
Yes?

629
00:34:43,080 --> 00:34:44,491
You've only been with Angie?

630
00:34:44,600 --> 00:34:46,728
Yes, that is the thing.
Mm-hmm.

631
00:34:48,080 --> 00:34:51,084
This is solvable.
This is a solvable problem.

632
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,406
Doesn't it suck how we can
want to run from our families,

633
00:34:59,480 --> 00:35:00,970
but impress them
at the same time?

634
00:35:02,280 --> 00:35:04,760
I just disappoint mine.

635
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:06,649
I think the build up to
facing their disappointment

636
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,131
is actually the worst part.

637
00:35:08,200 --> 00:35:10,362
"Anticappointment,"
I call it.

638
00:35:10,440 --> 00:35:12,602
I can't face the
anticappointment.

639
00:35:15,120 --> 00:35:16,400
Is that why
you're avoiding them?

640
00:35:17,320 --> 00:35:18,731
I just hate the holidays.

641
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:20,768
I hate having to reduce
everything I'm doing

642
00:35:20,840 --> 00:35:22,569
down to a sound byte
and then defend it.

643
00:35:23,320 --> 00:35:25,482
And I just...

644
00:35:25,600 --> 00:35:28,649
I hate reverting back to how
everyone saw me.

645
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,961
Maybe you should join the army.
Yeah.

646
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:35,081
Are you scared?

647
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:37,720
No.

648
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:42,520
Here.

649
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:46,809
Take that.

650
00:35:46,880 --> 00:35:48,450
How about a little
Nina Simone?

651
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:57,289
<i>Even though he knew he would
never see her again,</i>

652
00:36:57,400 --> 00:37:00,927
<i>Joe would always remember
this amazing moment,</i>

653
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:03,048
that only happened in his mind.

654
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:12,125
You know what, Madison?

655
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,521
Guess what, you can really see
the North Pole from up here.

656
00:37:14,600 --> 00:37:16,204
Did you know that?

657
00:37:16,280 --> 00:37:20,729
This is your daddy's favorite
place in the whole wide world!

658
00:37:25,120 --> 00:37:26,406
Three for the red lane, please.

659
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:28,084
You know, or maybe
what we could do is

660
00:37:28,160 --> 00:37:30,322
we could join Aunt Fishy for
a nice cup of hot cocoa.

661
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:32,641
What a wonderful view.
This was so much fun. Let's go.

662
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,688
Oh, come on.
We're not shooting her out of a cannon.

663
00:37:34,760 --> 00:37:35,841
You used to love those.

664
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,729
Where is your sense
of adventure?

665
00:37:37,800 --> 00:37:39,564
Buried in a good book?
No!

666
00:37:39,640 --> 00:37:42,086
I am not, you are...
That's just ridiculous!

667
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:44,561
Come on, Madison. Let's just go.
We're gonna show him.

668
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,529
Nice and easy does it,
right, sweetheart?

669
00:38:11,640 --> 00:38:15,531
Every time I go home, I'm told it's so
okay that I am not in a relationship.

670
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,602
It's so okay.

671
00:38:17,680 --> 00:38:18,841
So, how come you're not?

672
00:38:19,960 --> 00:38:21,485
How come you're not?

673
00:38:21,560 --> 00:38:22,766
Who says I'm not?

674
00:38:23,840 --> 00:38:25,444
Oh.

675
00:38:27,680 --> 00:38:29,569
Ooh.

676
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:31,688
I'm not.

677
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:34,200
Yeah, I just wanted to see
your reaction if you thought I was.

678
00:38:34,960 --> 00:38:36,166
Okay, Are you?

679
00:38:39,120 --> 00:38:41,009
I don't know.
Sort of.

680
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:43,800
He couldn't get away
for the holidays.

681
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:46,121
Prison?

682
00:38:47,240 --> 00:38:48,366
He's with his wife.

683
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:51,491
Oh.

684
00:38:53,440 --> 00:38:54,601
Yeah.

685
00:38:56,320 --> 00:38:58,080
Yeah, that's not the kind of
thing you'd want

686
00:38:58,120 --> 00:38:59,645
to share with mom and dad, huh?

687
00:38:59,720 --> 00:39:01,051
No, I don't like to brag.

688
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:06,609
Wait, look.

689
00:39:06,680 --> 00:39:08,250
I don't believe
in marriage,

690
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:10,564
okay? Love fades.

691
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:12,529
Yeah, so?

692
00:39:12,600 --> 00:39:15,331
Every time a face floods,
that's over a new relationship.

693
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:17,121
Right?
No.

694
00:39:17,200 --> 00:39:19,521
Don't do that.
Don't throw me up to me.

695
00:39:19,600 --> 00:39:21,409
Do you even know any
happily married people?

696
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:22,481
Yeah, my parents.

697
00:39:24,040 --> 00:39:25,690
I mean, you know what
I'm worried about,

698
00:39:25,800 --> 00:39:27,450
is that I'm never going to find
what they have.

699
00:39:27,520 --> 00:39:29,170
I'm worried that I will.

700
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:31,686
The second we left the house,
my parents' marriage imploded.

701
00:39:31,760 --> 00:39:33,285
They fight all the time now.

702
00:39:33,360 --> 00:39:34,646
So do mine.

703
00:39:34,720 --> 00:39:35,846
You just said they were happy.

704
00:39:35,920 --> 00:39:37,251
Passionate.

705
00:39:37,320 --> 00:39:39,209
Ugly.
Honest.

706
00:39:39,280 --> 00:39:40,281
Heartbreaking.

707
00:39:43,960 --> 00:39:46,247
So, who was he?
What?

708
00:39:46,360 --> 00:39:48,966
This guy that messed with your head.
I mean it's got to be somebody right?

709
00:39:49,040 --> 00:39:51,520
Otherwise, you wouldn't settle
for a married guy.

710
00:39:51,600 --> 00:39:54,046
You think he's going to leave
his wife for you?

711
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:57,209
Nope. That was never
on the table.

712
00:39:57,280 --> 00:39:59,248
And, besides,
we live in different states.

713
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:01,725
That's good.

714
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:04,201
Wouldn't want to go
wasting your life, right?

715
00:40:04,280 --> 00:40:06,248
You want to know
what's a waste of a life?

716
00:40:06,320 --> 00:40:08,607
A know-it-all with
a freshly shaved mullet,

717
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:12,048
who slaps on a uniform and thinks
it gives him the moral high ground.

718
00:40:12,120 --> 00:40:14,691
When, really, he's just risking
his life to please his dad.

719
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,446
Best of luck.

720
00:40:36,400 --> 00:40:37,640
Does your mother know?

721
00:40:39,200 --> 00:40:40,645
She knew before I did.

722
00:40:42,040 --> 00:40:43,087
How do you know?

723
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:49,644
Listen, if it's hard
to talk about,

724
00:40:49,720 --> 00:40:52,087
maybe a little role-play
can free you up.

725
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,401
I could play your mom
and you be you.

726
00:40:55,480 --> 00:40:56,686
Hi, sweetie!

727
00:41:00,160 --> 00:41:01,525
Hi, Mom.

728
00:41:03,520 --> 00:41:05,522
Stop. You're not
doing you right.

729
00:41:05,600 --> 00:41:06,761
What?

730
00:41:06,840 --> 00:41:08,444
You're not a robot yet.

731
00:41:08,520 --> 00:41:10,249
You're still a little kid.

732
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:14,205
I'll be you, you be Mom.

733
00:41:14,280 --> 00:41:17,363
Hi, Mom.
It was career day at school.

734
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:21,081
And Odell said that he wanted
to be a podiatrist like his dad.

735
00:41:21,160 --> 00:41:24,323
And I said, I wanted to be...

736
00:41:24,400 --> 00:41:27,882
Percy, don't gesture so much
when you talk.

737
00:41:27,960 --> 00:41:29,962
Well, Kenisha said that
she wanted to...

738
00:41:30,040 --> 00:41:32,008
Percy, stop tilting your head.

739
00:41:32,080 --> 00:41:34,401
Percy, stand with
your legs apart.

740
00:41:34,480 --> 00:41:36,050
Percy, don't smile so big.

741
00:41:39,600 --> 00:41:41,329
I said that I wanted to be...

742
00:41:47,960 --> 00:41:49,200
An explorer.

743
00:41:53,160 --> 00:41:57,290
And now you wear a "Do not
enter" sign across your chest.

744
00:41:57,360 --> 00:42:01,570
You couldn't be a gay man,
so you became a stereotype of a man.

745
00:42:01,640 --> 00:42:03,369
Oh, it's so sad.

746
00:42:04,480 --> 00:42:06,289
The things we do
in our childhood,

747
00:42:06,360 --> 00:42:08,966
just to fit in,
make us stand apart as adults.

748
00:42:10,920 --> 00:42:14,811
Cold, hard truth is, when I was asked
what I wanted to be when I grew up,

749
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:17,326
I never said, "alone."

750
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,050
You feel alone
with three teenagers?

751
00:42:19,120 --> 00:42:22,488
Oh, them. No. I lied.
I don't have any kids.

752
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,126
I don't even have a husband.
What?

753
00:42:25,200 --> 00:42:27,851
Yeah. I knew you'd think,
"She's alone,

754
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:30,730
"she's not getting any younger.
Of course she'd swallow a brooch."

755
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,041
I opened up to you
and you lied to me.

756
00:42:33,120 --> 00:42:35,771
No, I lied
before you opened up.

757
00:42:35,840 --> 00:42:37,330
I would never lie to you now.

758
00:42:37,400 --> 00:42:39,721
The conversation part
of this arrest is over.

759
00:42:58,480 --> 00:42:59,766
What?

760
00:42:59,840 --> 00:43:01,649
What?

761
00:43:01,720 --> 00:43:03,529
That scream you made,
coming down the hill.

762
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:09,441
Is that the Whitehead kid?

763
00:43:09,520 --> 00:43:11,170
The one we used
to call Schnozzle?

764
00:43:14,320 --> 00:43:16,482
Quick, quick,
what was his name?

765
00:43:16,560 --> 00:43:18,483
Skippy.
Don't say. "Skippy"

766
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:21,890
Oh, here. Oh.

767
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,169
Hey. Think you can
drop me at the mall?

768
00:43:25,240 --> 00:43:26,446
Get in.
All right.

769
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:28,644
Thanks.

770
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,609
Seriously,
what's his name? I can't remember.

771
00:43:30,680 --> 00:43:31,806
Schnozington.

772
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:33,925
Oh.

773
00:43:35,000 --> 00:43:36,240
Get in the back, Rags.

774
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:40,767
Does your mom know
you're out hitchhiking?

775
00:43:40,840 --> 00:43:43,923
No, she took my keys away
when she caught me with pot in the car.

776
00:43:44,880 --> 00:43:46,086
Well...

777
00:43:46,760 --> 00:43:48,046
What?

778
00:43:48,120 --> 00:43:49,531
It's not like we never
got stoned, Charlotte.

779
00:43:49,600 --> 00:43:50,840
We grew up in the '60s.

780
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,968
You grew up in the '60s?

781
00:43:53,040 --> 00:43:54,280
Cool!

782
00:43:54,400 --> 00:43:55,925
Hear that, Charlotte?
What?

783
00:43:56,000 --> 00:43:57,923
Schnozzle Whitehead
thinks we're cool.

784
00:43:59,920 --> 00:44:01,001
Wait. What did you call me?

785
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:07,080
Yeah we used to...
It was groovy.

786
00:44:07,160 --> 00:44:08,730
We knocked around.
We went to concerts.

787
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:10,245
Charlotte met Bob Dylan.

788
00:44:10,320 --> 00:44:12,243
Are you serious?
What was he like?

789
00:44:12,320 --> 00:44:14,049
No, I only met him
for a couple of seconds.

790
00:44:14,120 --> 00:44:16,566
Till security dragged you
off of him.

791
00:44:16,640 --> 00:44:18,642
Were you guys hippies?
Yeah!

792
00:44:18,720 --> 00:44:20,245
No.
What do you mean, "No"?

793
00:44:20,320 --> 00:44:22,243
Oh, my God!

794
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,800
She used to speak
at rallies,

795
00:44:24,880 --> 00:44:27,121
in front of anybody.
You should have heard her.

796
00:44:27,200 --> 00:44:30,170
No, it's just that I liked
how loud my voice sounded

797
00:44:30,240 --> 00:44:31,765
over the microphone.
It's nothing at all.

798
00:44:31,840 --> 00:44:35,561
Oh, no. You were fearless,
man, you had passion.

799
00:44:35,640 --> 00:44:37,722
I don't remember much
of that at all.

800
00:44:39,600 --> 00:44:41,364
You don't remember that day?

801
00:44:41,880 --> 00:44:42,961
No.

802
00:44:46,560 --> 00:44:47,721
<i>Really?</i>

803
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,843
That was a long time ago,
when...

804
00:44:55,720 --> 00:44:57,051
That was our...

805
00:44:58,920 --> 00:45:00,445
first time, huh?

806
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,363
Your idea to go up
in the woods.

807
00:45:07,240 --> 00:45:09,083
That was not.
I followed you, I did.

808
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:11,929
Oh, no, I followed you.

809
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:13,684
<i>I couldn't take
my eyes off you.</i>

810
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:15,320
<i>Yeah, neither could your dog.</i>

811
00:45:16,320 --> 00:45:17,651
Who could blame him?

812
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:20,803
You can just let me out here.

813
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:23,849
If you want.

814
00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:25,604
Right here is good,
actually.

815
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:25,081
Look, I crossed the line.

816
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:26,321
I'm sorry.
All right.

817
00:46:26,400 --> 00:46:27,845
I came on
a little strong.

818
00:46:27,920 --> 00:46:30,207
No, I shouldn't have said that.
That was below the belt.

819
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,760
I wouldn't let it go.
It's on me. All right?

820
00:46:32,840 --> 00:46:34,444
It's true.
It is your fault.

821
00:46:34,560 --> 00:46:35,766
You're a total hussy.

822
00:46:39,240 --> 00:46:42,801
Look, sometimes
things happen...

823
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:44,450
when you're not even
looking for it.

824
00:46:45,440 --> 00:46:47,169
He tell you that?
Yeah.

825
00:46:47,280 --> 00:46:49,009
Great.

826
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:51,606
Hey, I would love to have fallen
for someone as presentable as you.

827
00:46:51,680 --> 00:46:53,284
Okay? Trust me.

828
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:57,001
No. You just want to fall for me
because you know I'm leaving.

829
00:46:57,080 --> 00:46:58,969
Do you always speak
in country lyrics?

830
00:47:04,400 --> 00:47:06,528
Well, it's been, um...

831
00:47:06,600 --> 00:47:08,204
Exhausting.
Yeah.

832
00:47:11,640 --> 00:47:13,130
Have a good...

833
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:15,123
Yeah, you too.

834
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:17,282
I'll think good thoughts
for you in the new year.

835
00:47:17,360 --> 00:47:20,364
Oh, wow! You sound exactly
like my mom.

836
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:22,960
Cool.

837
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:25,122
I have four sisters, so...

838
00:47:25,200 --> 00:47:26,486
I can sound
like anyone's mom.

839
00:47:26,560 --> 00:47:28,085
Oh, well,
mine would love you.

840
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:31,327
Anyway, bye.

841
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:32,881
Yup.

842
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:49,842
Come with me.
What?

843
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,685
Look, I know you don't know me,
you're not even sure if you like me, but...

844
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:54,171
be my boyfriend.
Uh...

845
00:47:54,240 --> 00:47:56,720
Listen, I can't deal with that
look on their faces again.

846
00:47:56,800 --> 00:47:59,041
Okay? Just be my boyfriend
for one night.

847
00:47:59,120 --> 00:48:00,884
Oh, no way.
What are you going to do?

848
00:48:00,960 --> 00:48:02,564
There's no flights
until morning.

849
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:04,927
Look at this, you're just going to spend
Christmas by yourself,

850
00:48:05,000 --> 00:48:06,764
eating dinner
at Wetzel's Pretzels?

851
00:48:06,840 --> 00:48:08,729
All right. Okay, stop! That's crazy.
You're being deployed.

852
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:12,691
You deserve a crazy,
pull out all the stops, home-cooked meal

853
00:48:12,760 --> 00:48:15,127
and I can guarantee you that.

854
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:17,521
You would make
my parents so happy.

855
00:48:17,600 --> 00:48:21,844
I mean, really, isn't it
the Christian thing to do?

856
00:48:21,960 --> 00:48:24,361
Okay, well, fine, but...

857
00:48:25,480 --> 00:48:28,131
It involves
a tiny white lie, yes.

858
00:48:28,200 --> 00:48:31,409
But a lie
that provides comfort.

859
00:48:31,480 --> 00:48:34,927
And it's really perfect
because you are going to war.

860
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:36,650
And, you know,
that's a win-win.

861
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:37,881
I'm just...

862
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:40,520
Sorry.

863
00:48:43,880 --> 00:48:44,881
Wow.

864
00:48:46,080 --> 00:48:49,084
That is, kind of,
a beautiful moment.

865
00:48:53,440 --> 00:48:55,442
Look, hey...

866
00:48:55,520 --> 00:48:57,204
All we would
have to figure out

867
00:48:57,280 --> 00:48:59,009
is how long
we've been together.

868
00:49:00,040 --> 00:49:01,769
And what your name is.

869
00:49:05,720 --> 00:49:07,563
I just got you...

870
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,484
It's Christmas, so,
I got you a mistletoe!

871
00:49:12,440 --> 00:49:14,204
It's lame, whatever,
I'm stupid.

872
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:19,202
<i>Never having
French-kissed before,</i>

873
00:49:19,280 --> 00:49:21,169
<i>Charlie felt Lauren's tongue
in his mouth</i>

874
00:49:21,240 --> 00:49:24,483
<i>and he thought she was having
an epileptic seizure.</i>

875
00:49:24,560 --> 00:49:26,688
<i>When he realized she wasn't,</i>

876
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,411
<i>his heart began to soar.</i>

877
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:35,601
<i>Francis, the mall cop,
contemplated breaking up the young couple,</i>

878
00:49:35,680 --> 00:49:40,083
<i>not because they were kissing,
but because they were doing it so badly.</i>

879
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,403
<i>But, before he could,
not knowing why,</i>

880
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:48,042
<i>every kiss Francis had under
a mistletoe flashed before his eyes</i>

881
00:49:48,120 --> 00:49:49,406
<i>like a Christmas gift.</i>

882
00:50:01,800 --> 00:50:03,404
Ugh.

883
00:50:03,520 --> 00:50:05,522
Get out!
Get out of here!

884
00:50:05,600 --> 00:50:06,647
Sorry.

885
00:50:08,320 --> 00:50:09,731
Boo.

886
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,129
What's your problem, Lauren?
You're not such a dog.

887
00:50:15,240 --> 00:50:17,400
What are you doing hanging
out with this pus-face here?

888
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:19,727
- Shut up, Brady.
- Ooh.

889
00:50:19,800 --> 00:50:21,609
You're going to let your girlfriend
talk to me like that,

890
00:50:21,680 --> 00:50:24,729
Blisters?
Huh, pussy?

891
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:26,370
Mommy ever teach you
about deodorant?

892
00:50:28,440 --> 00:50:30,761
He doesn't smell
that bad, okay?

893
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:32,484
You smell a little bit,
but not that bad.

894
00:50:32,560 --> 00:50:33,800
I smell?

895
00:50:33,880 --> 00:50:36,042
I can smell you halfway
across the mall.

896
00:50:36,120 --> 00:50:38,122
You leave my brother alone!

897
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:39,929
Oh, yeah? Make me.

898
00:50:45,600 --> 00:50:46,601
Yes!

899
00:50:48,480 --> 00:50:50,482
Run!

900
00:50:50,560 --> 00:50:53,325
<i>This was the story
Bo would tell his friends for years.</i>

901
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:55,482
<i>Now, what really happened.</i>

902
00:51:05,840 --> 00:51:08,844
<i>His mission to rescue
his brother abruptly terminated,</i>

903
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:10,928
<i>Bo sat empty handed,</i>

904
00:51:11,000 --> 00:51:14,402
<i>contemplating the cataclysmic
consequences of his failure.</i>

905
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:35,084
Okay, we met where?

906
00:51:35,160 --> 00:51:37,208
Airport bar.
Too trashy.

907
00:51:37,320 --> 00:51:39,561
Okay, how about where I do
volunteer work?

908
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:41,165
Okay, where do you volunteer?

909
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:42,765
I don't.
But I've always wanted to.

910
00:51:42,840 --> 00:51:44,365
Now I don't have to.

911
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:47,046
Yeah, I don't think
just talking about volunteering counts.

912
00:51:47,120 --> 00:51:48,201
Pretty sure it does.

913
00:51:48,280 --> 00:51:49,611
Okay, how come
you never mentioned me?

914
00:51:49,680 --> 00:51:51,728
You're a Republican.

915
00:51:51,800 --> 00:51:54,610
When I first saw him,
I thought...

916
00:51:54,680 --> 00:51:56,728
this is never going to work.

917
00:51:57,640 --> 00:51:59,529
But, he was brave.

918
00:52:01,240 --> 00:52:02,765
She was...

919
00:52:04,120 --> 00:52:05,360
plucky.

920
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:09,401
He uses words like, "plucky."

921
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,522
That laugh.

922
00:52:11,600 --> 00:52:13,409
First time I heard it,
I was floored.

923
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:20,449
He was open in a way that
I never could be.

924
00:52:20,520 --> 00:52:22,887
I wasn't even put off
by his faith.

925
00:52:22,960 --> 00:52:25,406
I actually thought
it was kinda hot.

926
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:29,803
The whole time she talked
about "evolution,"

927
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,927
I wondered...

928
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,651
what it would be like
to touch her neck.

929
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:42,486
You have a great neck.

930
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:44,286
Oh.

931
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:50,884
I like the way he touches
his lower lip when he's feeling vulnerable.

932
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,610
I don't do that.
Like this.

933
00:52:52,680 --> 00:52:55,081
I don't do that.
Yeah.

934
00:52:55,160 --> 00:52:57,731
I wondered what it would be
like to kiss that lip.

935
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,768
Really?
No.

936
00:52:59,840 --> 00:53:01,968
But, that's what I'm going to say to
my mom and she's gonna eat it up.

937
00:53:02,440 --> 00:53:03,601
All right.

938
00:53:03,680 --> 00:53:04,761
So good.

939
00:53:06,840 --> 00:53:09,764
Before I saw her, I...

940
00:53:09,840 --> 00:53:11,683
didn't believe
in love at first sight.

941
00:53:12,600 --> 00:53:13,726
Thought it was bullshit.

942
00:53:14,600 --> 00:53:16,125
And then I saw this...

943
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,482
reckless girl who had forgotten
how beautiful she was,

944
00:53:22,360 --> 00:53:23,600
and I thought,

945
00:53:25,880 --> 00:53:29,407
I thought if I could wake up
every day and look into that face,

946
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:30,970
I could get through anything.

947
00:53:32,840 --> 00:53:34,888
And you...

948
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,725
were standing
right next to her.

949
00:54:34,920 --> 00:54:37,000
I thought you were
having dinner with your daughters?

950
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:39,240
You're going to ruin
your appetite.

951
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,049
I'm trying to.

952
00:54:41,120 --> 00:54:42,849
Cranberries get
on my nerves.

953
00:54:45,560 --> 00:54:48,723
I didn't want our last
conversation

954
00:54:48,800 --> 00:54:51,451
to be remembered
as our last conversation.

955
00:54:53,120 --> 00:54:55,441
Order whatever you want.

956
00:54:55,560 --> 00:54:57,767
It's on the house.
It's my Christmas gift to you.

957
00:54:59,960 --> 00:55:03,203
When I was younger, I worked
in a restaurant for a while.

958
00:55:03,320 --> 00:55:07,450
And if an ugly person came in,
I would often give him a free dessert.

959
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:11,241
And I thought of myself
as being really special for...

960
00:55:13,560 --> 00:55:15,289
treating the uglies well.

961
00:55:16,440 --> 00:55:18,204
It's not what I'm doing.

962
00:55:18,280 --> 00:55:19,486
I'm happy to hear it.

963
00:55:26,360 --> 00:55:27,566
I'll get you some pie.

964
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:46,689
Ruby? Listen...

965
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:48,806
You're not a coward.

966
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:50,644
You're the opposite
of a coward.

967
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,805
You're brave and you're beautiful
and generous and big hearted.

968
00:55:54,880 --> 00:55:57,167
Can we have a minute's
privacy here, please?

969
00:55:58,000 --> 00:55:59,126
Thank you.

970
00:56:01,960 --> 00:56:03,644
All that sadness.

971
00:56:03,720 --> 00:56:07,281
That feeling like you've landed
in the wrong life.

972
00:56:07,360 --> 00:56:09,203
Everybody feels that way, Ruby.

973
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:11,089
It's all just going to become
an anecdote.

974
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,527
You don't know
that yet, Ruby, but...

975
00:56:13,640 --> 00:56:15,085
you're grand...

976
00:56:15,160 --> 00:56:17,925
You're like a grand piano...

977
00:56:18,000 --> 00:56:20,731
around a bunch of little
toy pianos and uprights...

978
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,124
Thank you. But...

979
00:56:23,200 --> 00:56:25,282
you're the grand piano.

980
00:56:25,400 --> 00:56:27,209
<i>And for a brief moment,</i>

981
00:56:27,320 --> 00:56:29,448
<i>time was their friend,</i>

982
00:56:29,520 --> 00:56:32,763
<i>as Ruby saw Bucky
the way he felt inside.</i>

983
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:37,561
Do you know why
I came here every day?

984
00:56:37,640 --> 00:56:39,290
Twice a day, sometimes.

985
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:41,967
So I could see you.

986
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:44,201
Just to see you...

987
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:47,841
So I could be around you.

988
00:56:49,680 --> 00:56:51,250
Now I have to say goodbye again.

989
00:57:01,800 --> 00:57:03,802
I have a fear
that I am an impostor.

990
00:57:05,040 --> 00:57:09,045
My first play got
a lot of attention.

991
00:57:09,120 --> 00:57:11,805
So, basically I peaked at 19.

992
00:57:18,840 --> 00:57:20,365
I also have a fear of silence.

993
00:57:21,600 --> 00:57:23,011
I know.

994
00:57:23,080 --> 00:57:24,411
Okay, yeah.

995
00:57:32,920 --> 00:57:34,081
I'm dyslexic,

996
00:57:35,600 --> 00:57:39,446
so, when I was growing up,
I thought I was just stupid.

997
00:57:41,360 --> 00:57:42,600
I had a sister.

998
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:47,809
She was born with a weak heart.

999
00:57:50,600 --> 00:57:51,600
So...

1000
00:58:00,280 --> 00:58:02,567
Sometimes I think I might
be unlovable.

1001
00:58:06,400 --> 00:58:09,643
I hear myself trying so hard
to be funny.

1002
00:58:11,480 --> 00:58:13,130
I think you're funny,
'cause you're sad.

1003
00:58:47,120 --> 00:58:49,009
Percy? I confess.

1004
00:58:49,080 --> 00:58:51,287
Okay, I did it.
I took the brooch.

1005
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:54,847
I did.

1006
00:58:54,920 --> 00:58:56,001
I know.

1007
00:58:56,080 --> 00:58:57,081
For my sister.

1008
00:58:58,560 --> 00:59:02,167
I was just being
small and petty.

1009
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:05,403
I'm always measuring out how much
love and attention I'm getting

1010
00:59:05,520 --> 00:59:09,525
and then giving back just
exactly what I think I got.

1011
00:59:09,600 --> 00:59:12,604
Like I think
I'm gonna be gypped in some way.

1012
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:19,048
What makes a person behave like
that, can you tell me?

1013
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,281
A grown person.

1014
00:59:21,600 --> 00:59:22,600
And the three kids?

1015
00:59:23,840 --> 00:59:24,840
It wasn't a lie.

1016
00:59:26,840 --> 00:59:27,840
It was a wish.

1017
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:33,202
<i>As she heard herself
say it aloud,</i>

1018
00:59:33,280 --> 00:59:36,841
Emma remembered the moment
<i>she began to feel unremarkable.</i>

1019
00:59:45,160 --> 00:59:47,686
<i>It was the first time she felt
jealous of her sister,</i>

1020
00:59:47,760 --> 00:59:50,047
<i>who she always loved
and looked up to,</i>

1021
00:59:50,120 --> 00:59:51,724
<i>until she couldn't live up to.</i>

1022
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:04,366
<i>Emma had told herself
it was just an accident,</i>

1023
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:05,885
<i>and yet somehow today,</i>

1024
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,644
<i>Emma knew it wasn't.</i>

1025
01:00:15,920 --> 01:00:18,048
So, my mom has one sister,

1026
01:00:18,120 --> 01:00:19,485
Emma, she's always late.

1027
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:21,890
Their dad is Bucky.

1028
01:00:21,960 --> 01:00:24,361
And my dad's aunt will be there,
Aunt Fishy.

1029
01:00:24,440 --> 01:00:27,011
Don't ask. Nobody knows
why we call her that.

1030
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:28,764
And your brother is Hank,

1031
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:32,128
and his kids are Charlie,
Madison and Bo Joshua, Maddie and BJ.

1032
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:34,489
BJ.

1033
01:00:34,560 --> 01:00:36,562
What kind of a parent is gonna
name their kid BJ?

1034
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:39,520
They're gonna see
right through me.

1035
01:00:39,560 --> 01:00:41,483
Oh, no, they're gonna love you.

1036
01:00:41,560 --> 01:00:45,485
Just don't mention gun control,
women's rights, or religion.

1037
01:00:45,560 --> 01:00:47,562
Why don't you just tell them
I don't speak English?

1038
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:50,769
No, I just don't want them to think
I'm dating some narrow-minded birther.

1039
01:00:50,840 --> 01:00:53,571
The whole point of you coming home
with me is so I disappoint them.

1040
01:00:53,640 --> 01:00:55,529
Whoa.
No, don't take it personally.

1041
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,489
They are liberally judgmental.

1042
01:00:57,560 --> 01:00:59,320
Look, we have a plan,
let's just stick to it.

1043
01:00:59,360 --> 01:01:00,805
How come you begged me to
come home with you,

1044
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:02,609
if I'm such a narrow-minded
disappointment?

1045
01:01:02,720 --> 01:01:04,085
No, you misunderstood me...

1046
01:01:04,160 --> 01:01:06,003
Maybe you misunderstood you.

1047
01:01:06,080 --> 01:01:08,128
Of course, you're so open-minded,
how is that even possible?

1048
01:01:08,200 --> 01:01:09,486
Right?
Hey,

1049
01:01:09,600 --> 01:01:10,681
calm down,

1050
01:01:10,760 --> 01:01:12,728
man up,
and let's lie to my parents.

1051
01:01:13,120 --> 01:01:14,201
Okay?

1052
01:01:14,280 --> 01:01:15,440
Damn, lying comes
easy to you.

1053
01:01:59,200 --> 01:02:00,406
Oh!

1054
01:02:01,600 --> 01:02:02,681
Sorry.

1055
01:02:06,360 --> 01:02:07,930
Charlotte, come with me.

1056
01:02:09,320 --> 01:02:10,765
Sam...

1057
01:02:10,840 --> 01:02:13,605
If we just got away from everything,
all the distractions,

1058
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,251
the kids,
we might have a shot.

1059
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:18,163
I'm giving this
one last try here.

1060
01:02:18,240 --> 01:02:20,641
If we can't find
ourselves here...

1061
01:02:20,720 --> 01:02:22,210
how're we going to find
ourselves

1062
01:02:22,280 --> 01:02:25,329
on some worn out dream
we had of a trip to Africa.

1063
01:02:25,400 --> 01:02:28,324
It's so much more than a trip
and you know that.

1064
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,687
For 30 years
I've given us a pass,

1065
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:32,683
because you promised,

1066
01:02:32,760 --> 01:02:35,730
once I retired, you would
do this for us.

1067
01:02:35,800 --> 01:02:37,086
And moving out is for us?

1068
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,491
No the trip is for us,

1069
01:02:38,560 --> 01:02:40,449
because we've become invisible
to each other.

1070
01:02:40,520 --> 01:02:42,727
Now? You want to go now?

1071
01:02:42,800 --> 01:02:44,529
What, with everything that's
going on with the kids?

1072
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:46,409
They're not kids anymore!

1073
01:02:46,480 --> 01:02:48,050
That doesn't stop!

1074
01:02:48,120 --> 01:02:49,645
Don't turn your back on me,
Charlotte.

1075
01:02:50,960 --> 01:02:53,531
I am going to make
the dump salad.

1076
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:57,363
<i>The problem was,
they both were right.</i>

1077
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:00,489
<i>But the fight about the trip
wasn't about the trip.</i>

1078
01:03:00,560 --> 01:03:04,884
<i>It was about the thousand microscopic hurts
that accumulate over 40 years.</i>

1079
01:03:04,960 --> 01:03:06,200
You don't want
to get into this,

1080
01:03:07,240 --> 01:03:09,322
well, we are
getting into this.

1081
01:03:09,400 --> 01:03:11,482
Yes, you are
a wonderful mother.

1082
01:03:11,560 --> 01:03:13,608
But what happened to us?

1083
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:17,127
We used to slow dance in the living room
when the kids went to sleep.

1084
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:18,531
What happened to that couple?

1085
01:03:18,600 --> 01:03:19,965
I don't even know what
you're talking about.

1086
01:03:20,040 --> 01:03:22,088
There ought to be a whole
separate language for you.

1087
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:24,561
Wait, where's the pepper? Did I put
the pepper in the mash potatoes here?

1088
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:26,608
Oh.

1089
01:03:26,680 --> 01:03:28,603
Dad called, he said
he's bringing a friend,

1090
01:03:28,680 --> 01:03:30,523
probably an old student,
I don't know.

1091
01:03:30,600 --> 01:03:32,250
No, Rags!

1092
01:03:32,320 --> 01:03:34,607
Oh, my God! Rags!

1093
01:03:34,680 --> 01:03:35,727
Rags.

1094
01:03:35,800 --> 01:03:36,881
Get down, Rags.

1095
01:03:37,000 --> 01:03:38,570
Good boy.

1096
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,563
Go on.
Go on, go on, Rags.

1097
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:46,250
Why are you laughing?

1098
01:03:46,320 --> 01:03:47,760
I don't understand
how we're going to

1099
01:03:47,800 --> 01:03:50,804
have Christmas without
mashed potatoes.

1100
01:03:51,800 --> 01:03:53,131
Charlotte, it's funny.

1101
01:03:53,920 --> 01:03:55,001
My God.

1102
01:03:56,200 --> 01:03:59,727
When did we become
Alfred and Dizzy Ludwig?

1103
01:03:59,800 --> 01:04:01,131
Who are you talking about?

1104
01:04:01,200 --> 01:04:04,170
The dullest, most lifeless
couple my parents knew.

1105
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,881
I'm not apologizing
for 40 years of marriage.

1106
01:04:07,960 --> 01:04:10,486
We raised a spectacular family.

1107
01:04:10,560 --> 01:04:11,846
We made a beautiful home...

1108
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,365
And now you're afraid
to leave it.

1109
01:04:13,440 --> 01:04:15,010
Stop saying I'm afraid
like I'm afraid.

1110
01:04:15,120 --> 01:04:16,804
You are terrified.

1111
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:19,320
You're terrified to be alone with
me without a kid between us.

1112
01:04:19,360 --> 01:04:21,089
Look, Mom.

1113
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:23,401
You're terrified if you take
your eyes off those kids for one second,

1114
01:04:23,480 --> 01:04:25,164
something will happen
on your watch.

1115
01:04:25,240 --> 01:04:26,651
I have known you

1116
01:04:26,720 --> 01:04:30,008
for most of my life and clearly
you have no idea who I am.

1117
01:04:30,080 --> 01:04:31,080
You're right.

1118
01:04:32,600 --> 01:04:34,841
We lost track of each other,
raising the kids.

1119
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:37,805
And then Lizzy died.

1120
01:04:40,280 --> 01:04:41,566
<i>And we stepped back.</i>

1121
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,691
And we kept stepping back,

1122
01:04:44,760 --> 01:04:47,161
until that was comfortable,
until that was us.

1123
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,286
Why do you just accept that?

1124
01:04:51,080 --> 01:04:52,764
Did you ever consider

1125
01:04:53,760 --> 01:04:56,604
that this trip
is not my dream?

1126
01:04:56,680 --> 01:04:57,806
It's an old dream.

1127
01:04:58,480 --> 01:05:00,084
I was in my 20s.

1128
01:05:00,160 --> 01:05:03,130
It has no meaning
for me anymore.

1129
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:04,247
Then do it for me.

1130
01:05:06,600 --> 01:05:07,840
Where did you go?

1131
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:11,607
You got so small.

1132
01:05:11,680 --> 01:05:13,887
I'm in love with a girl
that doesn't even exist anymore.

1133
01:05:13,960 --> 01:05:15,246
I exist.

1134
01:05:15,320 --> 01:05:17,846
If you want to go on
a trip with a memory,

1135
01:05:17,920 --> 01:05:19,206
then be my guest. Go ahead.

1136
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:21,123
Well, I'm going.
That's fine, go.

1137
01:05:21,200 --> 01:05:22,645
You just go.

1138
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:25,929
One day, for God's sakes,
that's all I asked for,

1139
01:05:26,000 --> 01:05:27,525
was one day,

1140
01:05:27,600 --> 01:05:29,967
all you had to do was hang
in for another 12 hours

1141
01:05:30,040 --> 01:05:33,567
and then we'd be done, but, no,
you have to ruin this day for me too.

1142
01:05:33,640 --> 01:05:36,041
Well, you know what,
you can just leave now!

1143
01:05:36,160 --> 01:05:37,161
Just leave...
Hi.

1144
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:43,166
Merry Christmas.
Happy...

1145
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:45,083
Merry Christmas.

1146
01:05:45,160 --> 01:05:47,527
Mom, Dad, this is Joe.

1147
01:05:48,640 --> 01:05:49,640
Hi.

1148
01:05:50,920 --> 01:05:52,046
Well...

1149
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:53,201
We're engaged.

1150
01:05:59,800 --> 01:06:00,847
Oh, God.

1151
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:23,403
What's wrong with you?
What are you talking about, engaged?

1152
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:26,165
A boyfriend is one thing,
but engaged is a completely different story.

1153
01:06:26,240 --> 01:06:27,446
I made a mistake.

1154
01:06:27,520 --> 01:06:28,567
You think?

1155
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:30,483
When I agreed to come here
with you,

1156
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,324
this whole thing is
way too insane.

1157
01:06:32,400 --> 01:06:34,289
Well, now it is.
I mean, engaged?

1158
01:06:34,360 --> 01:06:35,885
You probably don't believe
in global warming,

1159
01:06:35,960 --> 01:06:38,930
okay? I could never marry you.
I'm sorry, but, please.

1160
01:06:39,000 --> 01:06:40,490
Why? 'Cause I'm not
already married?

1161
01:06:40,600 --> 01:06:43,080
Oh, that's nice.
That's nice.

1162
01:06:43,160 --> 01:06:44,810
You know what?
I've wasted enough time.

1163
01:06:44,880 --> 01:06:46,041
Merry Christmas.

1164
01:06:46,120 --> 01:06:49,727
No, Joe, wait.
I'm sorry, Joe, one sec...

1165
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,160
Okay?
Yeah.

1166
01:07:08,920 --> 01:07:10,400
Hi, honey. Congratulations.

1167
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,200
Where's Joe?

1168
01:07:13,920 --> 01:07:15,206
Oh.
Honey?

1169
01:07:19,440 --> 01:07:22,364
Mom, please, just don't
make that face.

1170
01:07:22,440 --> 01:07:24,283
I swear to God, if I look up
and you're making that face

1171
01:07:24,360 --> 01:07:25,441
I'm gonna lose it.

1172
01:07:25,560 --> 01:07:26,891
But I'm not making a face.

1173
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:28,724
Actually, Charlotte,
you are.

1174
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,450
Sam this is
my everyday face.

1175
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:32,170
You're going like this.
No, I'm...

1176
01:07:33,360 --> 01:07:35,601
I am not.

1177
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:38,081
Okay, I'll be a Sphinx, right?

1178
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:42,321
See? Hi, honey.

1179
01:07:42,400 --> 01:07:44,004
Oh, God, there it is!

1180
01:07:44,120 --> 01:07:45,326
What?

1181
01:07:45,400 --> 01:07:46,561
Now, Buttons, calm down.

1182
01:07:46,640 --> 01:07:48,324
Calm down?
Really, Dad, calm down?

1183
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:50,607
Nothing makes people less calm
than being told to calm down.

1184
01:07:50,680 --> 01:07:52,603
And now
you're making that face.

1185
01:07:52,680 --> 01:07:55,126
Dad, you're just
as bad as Mom.

1186
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:59,131
Honey. Honey-bunny.

1187
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:01,328
Oh, God, please,
stop mothering me.

1188
01:08:01,400 --> 01:08:03,402
But I am your mother
and I feel for you.

1189
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:05,403
No, you feel sorry for me.

1190
01:08:05,480 --> 01:08:09,041
And you make me feel that I'm a person
that people should feel sorry for.

1191
01:08:09,120 --> 01:08:10,565
That-
But you know, hey,

1192
01:08:10,640 --> 01:08:11,880
it wouldn't be Christmas
without Eleanor

1193
01:08:11,960 --> 01:08:13,485
coming home
to disappoint everyone.

1194
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:15,085
You're not a disappointment.

1195
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,650
Right, okay.

1196
01:08:16,720 --> 01:08:18,131
Well, let me just give you
your Christmas present early.

1197
01:08:18,600 --> 01:08:19,761
Mom, Dad,

1198
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,609
Joe is actually...

1199
01:08:25,560 --> 01:08:28,609
...a smoker.
He is a chain-smoker.

1200
01:08:29,520 --> 01:08:31,010
That's right.

1201
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:32,730
Just can't seem to quit.

1202
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,529
- It's tough.
- Oh, well...

1203
01:08:34,600 --> 01:08:36,329
You know what,
this calls for a toast.

1204
01:08:36,400 --> 01:08:38,767
Yeah.
Bubbly, bubbly.

1205
01:08:38,840 --> 01:08:40,251
I'm an alcoholic.
Wow.

1206
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:43,720
I'm just kidding.
Yeah.

1207
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:47,721
Quite a kidder.

1208
01:08:47,800 --> 01:08:49,643
Yeah, just can't help it.

1209
01:08:49,720 --> 01:08:51,131
Aw, try.
Hey.

1210
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:52,927
We're here.

1211
01:08:53,000 --> 01:08:54,525
Oh, Mom?
Yeah, what?

1212
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,170
Just don't mention anything
about the engagement, okay?

1213
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:57,730
'Cause we haven't told
Joe's parents yet.

1214
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,000
That's fine, that's good.
Okay.

1215
01:09:00,360 --> 01:09:02,408
Charlie, what happened
to your face?

1216
01:09:02,920 --> 01:09:04,922
Oh, he...

1217
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:07,401
Oh, my God.

1218
01:09:08,280 --> 01:09:11,363
Everyone, um, this is Joe.

1219
01:09:11,440 --> 01:09:14,523
And, yes... And Joe
and your Aunt Eleanor

1220
01:09:14,600 --> 01:09:16,045
are engaged.

1221
01:09:16,120 --> 01:09:17,326
Charlotte!
What? Oh, my God.

1222
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,482
Mom.
It just slipped out, I don't know.

1223
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:21,085
I'm sorry, I don't know what...

1224
01:09:21,160 --> 01:09:22,764
Right hand, orange,

1225
01:09:22,840 --> 01:09:24,046
and left hand, blue.

1226
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:25,326
Okay, yes.

1227
01:09:25,400 --> 01:09:27,323
I got a right on orange.

1228
01:09:27,400 --> 01:09:29,243

Anyway, Merry Christmas, huh?

1254
01:11:38,680 --> 01:11:40,364
Kiss her, Grandpa.
Oh, my goodness.

1255
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:42,690
Oh.

1256
01:11:43,360 --> 01:11:45,169
Oh, Bo. Oh, dear.

1257
01:11:45,240 --> 01:11:46,765
You're suppose to kiss me.
Oh, okay.

1258
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:57,921
What are we doing here?

1259
01:11:58,040 --> 01:11:59,280
Is this where
you left your car?

1260
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:01,605
Yes?

1261
01:12:01,680 --> 01:12:03,011
Merry Christmas.

1262
01:12:10,440 --> 01:12:11,965
Thanks for the ride.

1263
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:14,041
If I ask you a question,

1264
01:12:15,160 --> 01:12:16,286
would you answer
me honestly?

1265
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,000
Try me.

1266
01:12:20,800 --> 01:12:22,450
Are you really a psychiatrist?

1267
01:12:22,520 --> 01:12:24,761
Of course, I am, sort of.
I'm a life coach.

1268
01:12:26,680 --> 01:12:28,489
But you said
you were a doctor.

1269
01:12:28,560 --> 01:12:29,846
Well...

1270
01:12:29,920 --> 01:12:31,604
You heard of Dr. Seuss?

1271
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:33,926
I'm Dr. Newport.

1272
01:12:37,200 --> 01:12:38,326
Wow.

1273
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:39,481
Officer Williams?

1274
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,280
Can I give you a hug?

1275
01:12:43,440 --> 01:12:44,440
No.

1276
01:12:45,920 --> 01:12:47,081
All right, then.

1277
01:12:47,960 --> 01:12:49,610
A word of advice?

1278
01:12:49,680 --> 01:12:51,887
Certainly. If I were you...

1279
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:54,122
For you, not from you.

1280
01:12:54,920 --> 01:12:55,920
Of course.

1281
01:12:57,600 --> 01:13:01,889
You should buy your sister the most
expensive gift you can find.

1282
01:13:03,120 --> 01:13:05,771
Try and be be the person
you want to become.

1283
01:13:12,520 --> 01:13:15,330
<i>Emma was filled
with a tiny distant memory</i>

1284
01:13:15,400 --> 01:13:17,607
<i>she wasn't
sure even happened,</i>

1285
01:13:17,680 --> 01:13:21,162
<i>when her world was still
open to the possibility of magic.</i>

1286
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:33,410
Yeah.
Carrots.

1287
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:36,006
Everybody make sure
you try those potatoes.

1288
01:13:36,080 --> 01:13:38,321
Single perfect form, you be...

1289
01:13:43,320 --> 01:13:44,560
Oh, Dad?

1290
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:50,363
I've been thinking about
our family a lot today.

1291
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:52,568
And I have something
that I'd like to say.

1292
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:55,444
I want to tell you...

1293
01:13:55,520 --> 01:13:56,851
No! Please, no.

1294
01:14:01,280 --> 01:14:02,441
...how happy I am

1295
01:14:03,640 --> 01:14:04,800
that we're all here together.

1296
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:08,128
Well, hear, hear.

1297
01:14:08,200 --> 01:14:10,362
We don't spend much time
under the same roof,

1298
01:14:12,480 --> 01:14:14,050
but no matter what happens...

1299
01:14:15,240 --> 01:14:17,288
we are family.

1300
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:20,409
Oh, God, look at
Bo's shiny, little face.

1301
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,962
Well, I think
that what Grandpa is...

1302
01:14:27,440 --> 01:14:28,771
trying to say is...

1303
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:32,769
that celebrations like this

1304
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:34,560
they just kind of...

1305
01:14:35,960 --> 01:14:37,200
remind us of...

1306
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:39,765
how...

1307
01:14:39,840 --> 01:14:41,126
Irreplaceable.
Irreplaceable...

1308
01:14:42,160 --> 01:14:43,889
So, just...

1309
01:14:43,960 --> 01:14:46,247
But you know what, that is
enough said on that front, right?

1310
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:49,164
Let's just toast to
celebrations, everyone.

1311
01:14:49,240 --> 01:14:50,571
Cheers!

1312
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:52,965
Okay.
Cheers.

1313
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:54,451
I'm hungry.

1314
01:14:54,520 --> 01:14:57,922
I know. I hate to say it,
but Emma's not here yet.

1315
01:14:58,000 --> 01:14:59,126
I think we should wait.

1316
01:14:59,200 --> 01:15:00,884
I think it's important
for us to wait

1317
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:02,928
for just a few minutes.

1318
01:15:03,000 --> 01:15:05,924
Maybe the storm has knocked
out some traffic signals.

1319
01:15:06,000 --> 01:15:07,206
Yeah, but she's always late.

1320
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:08,441
Let's just dig in!
Yes.

1321
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,727
Go ahead. It's Christmas, right?
Yes.

1322
01:15:10,800 --> 01:15:12,723
Aren't we going to say grace?

1323
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:14,962
Well, just let me finish,
for one second, Joe.

1324
01:15:15,040 --> 01:15:16,451
Dad, would you like
to say grace?

1325
01:15:16,520 --> 01:15:17,646
Not really.

1326
01:15:17,720 --> 01:15:19,609
Well, maybe you'd like
to listen to Bo

1327
01:15:19,680 --> 01:15:21,728
say grace. Bo, would
you like to give thanks?

1328
01:15:21,800 --> 01:15:23,370
No, thanks.

1329
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:25,124
Okay.
You know what, I'll do it.

1330
01:15:25,920 --> 01:15:27,251
Oh. All right.

1331
01:15:29,800 --> 01:15:31,131
Oh.

1332
01:15:31,760 --> 01:15:32,760
Dear Lord,

1333
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:37,002
or whoever is listening,

1334
01:15:37,080 --> 01:15:43,201
thank you for this beautiful meal
when there are so many who have so little.

1335
01:15:43,280 --> 01:15:45,931
And although I'm not with
my own family tonight,

1336
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:50,050
I'm grateful to be sharing
Christmas with such a thoughtful,

1337
01:15:51,160 --> 01:15:52,571
loving family...

1338
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:53,766
Oh, my God.

1339
01:15:53,840 --> 01:15:54,921
Jesus Christ!

1340
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:56,525
Holy...

1341
01:15:56,600 --> 01:15:58,409
It's Rags.

1342
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,801
Mother of God, what are you
feeding that animal?

1343
01:16:03,960 --> 01:16:04,960
Oh, Rags.
Yikes.

1344
01:16:10,440 --> 01:16:12,363
It's okay. At least,
dinner smells good.

1345
01:16:12,440 --> 01:16:13,487
Right?
Fabulous.

1346
01:16:13,560 --> 01:16:14,686
Let's dig in.

1347
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:22,005
What's the matter?

1348
01:16:22,080 --> 01:16:23,081
The pepper?

1349
01:16:23,160 --> 01:16:24,241
Is that what it is?

1350
01:16:24,320 --> 01:16:26,402
It needs more potato.

1351
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,289
I can't believe
you're getting married, El.

1352
01:16:28,360 --> 01:16:29,407
Congratulations.

1353
01:16:29,520 --> 01:16:31,488
Yeah, congratulations.

1354
01:16:31,560 --> 01:16:32,766
I just can't believe it.

1355
01:16:32,840 --> 01:16:35,650
Mmm. Stop saying that.

1356
01:16:35,720 --> 01:16:37,085
It's just...

1357
01:16:37,160 --> 01:16:39,606
Joe, do you really know
what you're getting into?

1358
01:16:40,920 --> 01:16:43,400
Yeah, I've never
been more certain.

1359
01:16:43,480 --> 01:16:45,608
Actually, I got down
on one knee when I proposed.

1360
01:16:46,760 --> 01:16:48,205
She had her doubts,
but I didn't.

1361
01:16:49,480 --> 01:16:50,920
Yeah, I knew it
the minute I met her.

1362
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,485
Kiss her. Kiss her.

1363
01:16:54,280 --> 01:16:56,169
Come on.
Kiss!

1364
01:16:56,240 --> 01:16:57,366
Go ahead.

1365
01:16:57,440 --> 01:16:58,885
Give her a kiss.
Come on.

1366
01:17:06,160 --> 01:17:07,764
That is a kiss.

1367
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,049
<i>When Emma entered the dining room,</i>

1368
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:15,522
<i>she remembered to be the person
she wanted to become.</i>

1369
01:17:15,600 --> 01:17:17,489
Merry Christmas, everyone.

1370
01:17:17,560 --> 01:17:19,801
You're finally here.
We've been missing you.

1371
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:21,723
<i>But when confronted by family,</i>

1372
01:17:22,600 --> 01:17:23,600
<i>she forgot.</i>

1373
01:17:24,600 --> 01:17:26,284
Good, you started without me.

1374
01:17:29,920 --> 01:17:31,285
Don't get up.

1375
01:17:33,440 --> 01:17:36,125
I'm so sorry.
Dad and Eleanor both brought guests.

1376
01:17:36,200 --> 01:17:38,328
Oh, can I sit here
near you, Madison?

1377
01:17:40,640 --> 01:17:43,849
I'd like to sit next to the
prettiest girl at the table, is that okay?

1378
01:17:45,480 --> 01:17:46,561
You're such a...

1379
01:17:46,680 --> 01:17:47,681
Madison?

1380
01:17:51,080 --> 01:17:54,482
<i>As Aunt Fishy slept, she dreamt
of dancing at the Mocamba,</i>

1381
01:17:54,560 --> 01:17:56,608
<i>Christmas of '46,</i>

1382
01:17:56,680 --> 01:17:59,968
<i>knowing for certain
she could get any man in the place,</i>

1383
01:18:00,040 --> 01:18:03,362
<i>Never considering she would be
anything but young.</i>

1384
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:21,724
<i>The night had become
so haunted by ghosts of Christmases past</i>

1385
01:18:21,840 --> 01:18:23,842
<i>that Rags began to stress-eat.</i>

1386
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:27,807
I think it's time
to go around the table

1387
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:31,282
and tell each other our
wish for the new year, right?

1388
01:18:31,360 --> 01:18:33,203
Oh, God.

1389
01:18:33,800 --> 01:18:35,040
What?

1390
01:18:35,120 --> 01:18:37,851
What? I mean, everybody
loves this game and

1391
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:39,046
we play it every year.

1392
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:40,804
Everybody hates this game.

1393
01:18:40,880 --> 01:18:42,803
And no one has
the nerve to tell you.

1394
01:18:42,880 --> 01:18:44,291
Emma.

1395
01:18:44,360 --> 01:18:45,930
Does anyone enjoy this?

1396
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:49,640
I'd just like to say,

1397
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:51,768
it's so wonderful to see
my daughters together.

1398
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:54,485
I remember when Charlotte
wouldn't even

1399
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:57,291
be in the Christmas play,
unless they let Emma in too.

1400
01:18:59,880 --> 01:19:02,611
They would sneak down and eat
the cookies Effie made for Santa

1401
01:19:02,680 --> 01:19:04,280
and they thought
we didn't know about it,

1402
01:19:04,760 --> 01:19:05,886
but we did.

1403
01:19:19,480 --> 01:19:21,767
Dad, you're so right.

1404
01:19:22,640 --> 01:19:23,640
You're my sister,

1405
01:19:24,880 --> 01:19:26,450
and I love you
Okay.

1406
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:30,001
Mash potatoes?

1407
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:37,288
Did you get the B-I-K-E-S
for the K-I-D-S?

1408
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:41,126
No. I thought we could go with
something hand-made this year.

1409
01:19:41,200 --> 01:19:43,362
Hank, we agreed on the bikes.

1410
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:45,442
Right, I just...
You know...

1411
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:48,171
Hand-made gifts are
from the soul, right?

1412
01:19:48,240 --> 01:19:51,210
They can't ride a soul to
school, they wanted bikes.

1413
01:19:51,280 --> 01:19:52,280
Kids want bikes.

1414
01:20:01,200 --> 01:20:02,964
Sam,

1415
01:20:03,040 --> 01:20:07,762
that was the best dinner
I ever had in my entire mouth.

1416
01:20:07,840 --> 01:20:10,320
I'm so glad
to hear that, Aunt Fishy.

1417
01:20:10,400 --> 01:20:11,845
How was the trip, dear?

1418
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:14,686
Fantastic.

1419
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:26,651
<i>Rags knew he was eating
his emotions, but could not stop himself.</i>

1420
01:20:28,160 --> 01:20:30,003
Could you pass
the, uh, green beans?

1421
01:20:31,120 --> 01:20:32,120
Yeah, sure.

1422
01:20:33,640 --> 01:20:35,130
You know what,
here, let me get them for you.

1423
01:20:35,200 --> 01:20:36,611
It's okay. I got it.

1424
01:20:36,680 --> 01:20:37,966
It's all right, I'm holding it.

1425
01:20:38,040 --> 01:20:40,771
I can get my own green beans,
it's fine.

1426
01:20:40,840 --> 01:20:43,127
Can I, please, just get
my own green beans?

1427
01:20:43,200 --> 01:20:44,486
Yes, just trying
to be helpful.

1428
01:20:44,560 --> 01:20:46,050
You know what
would have been helpful,

1429
01:20:46,120 --> 01:20:47,610
is if you would have done
what you said you're gonna do.

1430
01:20:47,680 --> 01:20:49,728
Now I have two helmets
sitting under my tree.

1431
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,564
This is exactly why I left.

1432
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:52,971
- This is why you left?
- Yes.

1433
01:20:53,040 --> 01:20:54,690
Seems like you had a whole
lot more reasons than that,

1434
01:20:54,760 --> 01:20:57,127
'cause you left so fast
there was a cartoon swoosh cloud

1435
01:20:57,200 --> 01:20:58,326
in the doorway.

1436
01:20:58,400 --> 01:20:59,760
I should have left
a long time ago.

1437
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:01,491
Stop fighting!

1438
01:21:01,560 --> 01:21:03,608
Why can't you stop fighting?

1439
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:05,762
Why wont you stop?

1440
01:21:05,880 --> 01:21:07,723
All right, everybody,
let's just stop it, okay?

1441
01:21:07,840 --> 01:21:10,081
Just shut up and eat.

1442
01:21:10,160 --> 01:21:11,286
I mean, we all...

1443
01:21:11,360 --> 01:21:13,806
We love each other
and it's Christmas.

1444
01:21:13,880 --> 01:21:16,247
It's the most wonderful time
of the year!

1445
01:21:18,440 --> 01:21:20,010
Storm took out
the power lines.

1446
01:21:22,520 --> 01:21:24,010
Stop it. No.

1447
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,048
Madison, don't be
scared, all right?

1448
01:21:28,360 --> 01:21:29,930
Bucky! Bucky!

1449
01:21:30,000 --> 01:21:31,047
Dad!

1450
01:21:32,400 --> 01:21:33,400
Dad?

1451
01:21:58,240 --> 01:21:59,924
We're setting up
a CAT scan immediately.

1452
01:22:00,000 --> 01:22:02,162
I can only imagine
how shaken up you all must be.

1453
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:04,368
It's quite
the Christmas present.

1454
01:22:04,480 --> 01:22:05,480
Thank you, Doctor.

1455
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:16,320
Hank...

1456
01:22:18,720 --> 01:22:19,720
FOMO.

1457
01:22:23,040 --> 01:22:24,246
You have to wait back here.

1458
01:22:31,160 --> 01:22:32,321
Wait!

1459
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:03,483
What the hell
are you doing with your life?

1460
01:23:03,560 --> 01:23:06,609
You're sleeping with that oily
doctor when you're engaged?

1461
01:23:07,200 --> 01:23:08,645
Dr. Morrissey?

1462
01:23:08,720 --> 01:23:10,840
That's... Mom, I really don't
know where you got that,

1463
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:13,446
but you're having a rough night
so I'm going to let it slide.

1464
01:23:13,520 --> 01:23:15,284
But, honestly, Mom,
that's ridiculous.

1465
01:23:15,360 --> 01:23:17,408
You know something, you always
talk too loudly when you're lying.

1466
01:23:17,480 --> 01:23:19,244
I do not. That's...
Uh-huh.

1467
01:23:19,320 --> 01:23:20,321
That's not even...

1468
01:23:28,280 --> 01:23:29,280
Fine.

1469
01:23:30,640 --> 01:23:32,483
I knew you wouldn't understand.

1470
01:23:32,560 --> 01:23:34,688
In fact, I knew you would
react exactly like this.

1471
01:23:34,760 --> 01:23:35,886
I see.

1472
01:23:35,960 --> 01:23:38,486
And... Oh, perfect.
There's the face.

1473
01:23:39,480 --> 01:23:40,925
Did I do something wrong?

1474
01:23:42,200 --> 01:23:44,601
Was I too preoccupied with Lucy?

1475
01:23:44,680 --> 01:23:47,889
Did I make you feel
like you don't deserve more?

1476
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,684
Please, stop,
this isn't about you.

1477
01:23:49,760 --> 01:23:51,808
Stop treating me like I'm
something that's broken.

1478
01:23:51,920 --> 01:23:53,888
Okay? You can't fix me.

1479
01:23:53,960 --> 01:23:55,928
Just go fix yourself.

1480
01:23:56,000 --> 01:23:57,411
This is who I am.

1481
01:23:57,480 --> 01:23:59,209
You need to accept that I'm
never going to be the person

1482
01:23:59,280 --> 01:24:00,691
that you want me to be.

1483
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:02,888
You are the person
I want you to be,

1484
01:24:02,960 --> 01:24:04,200
except...
Except.

1485
01:24:04,280 --> 01:24:06,726
Yeah, except, you

1486
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:10,361
deserve more. I think you could
build a life with this Joe.

1487
01:24:10,840 --> 01:24:11,840
Oh, Mom.

1488
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:17,207
Joe is a prop.

1489
01:24:17,320 --> 01:24:19,971
Joe is a stranger
I picked up in an airport bar.

1490
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:22,889
He is something I invented,

1491
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:25,611
so that I didn't have
to face your face.

1492
01:24:30,080 --> 01:24:31,764
Eleanor.
Just...

1493
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:37,571
This could happen
to anyone, Madison.

1494
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:41,770
There was a lot of yelling going
on, I'm surprised...

1495
01:24:41,840 --> 01:24:44,047
it doesn't happen
more often.

1496
01:24:44,120 --> 01:24:45,724
In your defense,

1497
01:24:47,120 --> 01:24:48,565
it was probably

1498
01:24:50,160 --> 01:24:52,322
the dump salad.

1499
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:53,885
There's a reason
it's called that.

1500
01:25:00,280 --> 01:25:03,727
I tried, Madison.
Damn it, I tried.

1501
01:25:05,480 --> 01:25:08,404
What?
She doesn't love me anymore.

1502
01:25:12,200 --> 01:25:13,247
Forty years.

1503
01:25:14,880 --> 01:25:15,880
Gone.

1504
01:25:16,480 --> 01:25:17,561
Poof

1505
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:30,761
Thank you, Tinkerbell.

1506
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:33,684
I don't even think I kissed
him hello tonight.

1507
01:25:33,760 --> 01:25:37,287
You can kiss him tomorrow,
because he's gonna be all right. Really, Emma.

1508
01:25:37,400 --> 01:25:40,080
Oh, that's right, Charlotte.
Everything's always balloons and Jello.

1509
01:25:40,120 --> 01:25:42,771
Wow, I realize that

1510
01:25:43,680 --> 01:25:45,091
we haven't been close

1511
01:25:45,200 --> 01:25:47,601
but I guess I just
didn't really know how much...

1512
01:25:48,720 --> 01:25:50,449
you don't like me.

1513
01:25:50,520 --> 01:25:52,488
It's not that I don't like you,

1514
01:25:52,560 --> 01:25:54,722
it's just that I love you more
when I'm not with you.

1515
01:25:56,080 --> 01:25:58,048
It's like we're allergic
to each other.

1516
01:25:58,120 --> 01:26:00,885
But, hey, we were
branded from birth.

1517
01:26:00,960 --> 01:26:04,009
I'm the coward.
Dad always said you're the brave one.

1518
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:05,764
No, Dad didn't say
that at all.

1519
01:26:05,840 --> 01:26:08,286
Dad said you're the brave one
and I'm the nice one.

1520
01:26:08,360 --> 01:26:10,886
No. I'm the smart one,
you're the brave one.

1521
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:12,041
No, please...

1522
01:26:12,920 --> 01:26:14,684
I'm the coward.

1523
01:26:14,760 --> 01:26:16,649
No, I'm the coward.

1524
01:26:16,720 --> 01:26:18,006
No, I am, that's what Dad said.

1525
01:26:18,080 --> 01:26:19,445
For God's sake!
I'm the coward.

1526
01:26:19,520 --> 01:26:21,124
No. Don't even
kid yourself.

1527
01:26:21,200 --> 01:26:23,009
Dad said that you're the brave one
and I'm the nice one.

1528
01:26:23,080 --> 01:26:25,003
I am the coward!

1529
01:26:25,080 --> 01:26:27,208
You are the brave one
and you're the smart one.

1530
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:29,362
I'm the coward.
Ladies! Ladies! Shh.

1531
01:26:29,440 --> 01:26:31,090
Yes, of course. Sorry.

1532
01:26:36,120 --> 01:26:37,565
Tell me what
happened to us?

1533
01:26:37,640 --> 01:26:39,130
You got the happy gene.
I didn't.

1534
01:26:39,200 --> 01:26:40,884
That's not true.

1535
01:26:40,960 --> 01:26:42,200
Charlotte...

1536
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:43,770
No.

1537
01:26:43,840 --> 01:26:45,968
You could be happy
licking an envelope.

1538
01:26:46,040 --> 01:26:49,681
But, hey, I'd be happy too,
if I had everything.

1539
01:26:49,760 --> 01:26:51,728
Everything? You think
I've had everything?

1540
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:55,600
If you ever just asked me once how I am,
you'd know that my life is just

1541
01:26:55,680 --> 01:26:56,966
as screwed up as your life.

1542
01:26:57,040 --> 01:26:58,769
Charlotte, look at me.

1543
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:01,971
I am a fully grown woman.

1544
01:27:02,040 --> 01:27:04,850
You sat me at the kids table!

1545
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:08,891
You have no idea what that feels like,
and you never will, you have a family,

1546
01:27:09,760 --> 01:27:10,760
I am alone.

1547
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:12,921
Don't I count as family?

1548
01:27:14,120 --> 01:27:16,487
Don't my kids count
as family?

1549
01:27:16,560 --> 01:27:18,289
They're your family too,
god dammit!

1550
01:27:18,360 --> 01:27:19,964
- They are your family.
- Ladies!

1551
01:27:20,040 --> 01:27:21,280
Out!
Oh, God, I'm sorry.

1552

1557
01:27:51,920 --> 01:27:53,922
Miss Newport,
I have some news.

1558
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:01,762
So, your father had
a small stroke.

1559
01:28:01,880 --> 01:28:04,281
He's stabilized now
and he's gonna be fine.

1560
01:28:04,360 --> 01:28:07,762
You can see him later,
but right now we'd like him to rest.

1561
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:09,126
You can see him
when he wakes up.

1562
01:28:09,200 --> 01:28:10,440
But he's okay?

1563
01:28:10,520 --> 01:28:12,727
His vitals are fine,
he's just resting.

1564
01:28:12,800 --> 01:28:13,961
I'll check back in
with you later.

1565
01:28:14,040 --> 01:28:15,121
Good, great.

1566
01:28:15,200 --> 01:28:16,201
Thank you.

1567
01:28:17,280 --> 01:28:18,560
He's sleeping right now.

1568
01:28:19,800 --> 01:28:22,690
Get outta town.
Your doctor is "married guy"?

1569
01:28:23,640 --> 01:28:24,640
No.

1570
01:28:28,680 --> 01:28:30,409
Yeah, I met him
a couple of years ago

1571
01:28:30,480 --> 01:28:32,642
when I brought my grandpa
in for a check up.

1572
01:28:32,720 --> 01:28:34,051
A little agey, isn't he?

1573
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:37,126
Well, let him down easy.

1574
01:28:37,840 --> 01:28:39,729
I mean,

1575
01:28:39,800 --> 01:28:42,520
even a married guy doesn't
deserve to get dumped on Christmas, right?

1576
01:28:46,440 --> 01:28:47,440
Seriously?

1577
01:28:48,760 --> 01:28:50,762
You are not this person.

1578
01:28:50,840 --> 01:28:52,280
Kinda look like her, though,
don't I?

1579
01:28:52,560 --> 01:28:53,686
No.

1580
01:28:54,840 --> 01:28:56,410
You don't even know me.
What?

1581
01:28:57,720 --> 01:28:58,720
After today?

1582
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:01,124
Wow.

1583
01:29:01,200 --> 01:29:02,690
Lying really does
come easy to you.

1584
01:29:04,520 --> 01:29:06,204
Okay, how about this
for the truth?

1585
01:29:06,280 --> 01:29:08,169
I've known you
for eight hours,

1586
01:29:08,280 --> 01:29:10,009
and you are leaving in five.

1587
01:29:10,080 --> 01:29:13,289
I'm sorry about your Grandpa, hon,
but he's gonna be okay. I promise.

1588
01:29:16,280 --> 01:29:17,520
Be careful over there, okay?

1589
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:19,600
Yeah, you too.

1590
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:26,523
Lucky me.
I get to see you at Christmas.

1591
01:29:27,680 --> 01:29:29,808
Wanna see what I got you?
Yeah.

1592
01:29:38,160 --> 01:29:43,883
<i>♪ The first Noel

1593
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:47,362

1594
01:29:54,080 --> 01:29:55,445
Sorry, sorry.

1595
01:29:56,320 --> 01:29:58,607
Sorry, no.

1596
01:30:01,280 --> 01:30:02,611
Sorry.

1597
01:30:10,640 --> 01:30:11,926
Sorry.

1598
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:14,128
Sorry!

1599
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:16,440
Excuse me.

1600
01:30:19,040 --> 01:30:20,929
Wait. No. Hold the elevator!

1601
01:30:33,720 --> 01:30:34,960
That was a good one.

1602
01:30:36,640 --> 01:30:38,051
You would've loved
to have seen you.

1603
01:30:39,120 --> 01:30:40,167
You didn't leave.

1604
01:30:41,440 --> 01:30:44,250
I couldn't.
We're too good a story.

1605
01:30:45,600 --> 01:30:47,204
You picked me up in a bar.

1606
01:30:48,320 --> 01:30:49,685
You came on to me.

1607
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:51,330
You stalked me
in an airport.

1608
01:30:51,400 --> 01:30:53,243
You begged me
to go home with you.

1609
01:30:53,320 --> 01:30:54,651
I couldn't get rid of you.

1610
01:30:56,280 --> 01:30:58,044
Yeah, we finally agree
on something.

1611
01:31:01,680 --> 01:31:03,887
We're together just to say
goodbye, you know.

1612
01:31:04,400 --> 01:31:05,400
I know.

1613
01:31:07,640 --> 01:31:09,449
You're like Clarence,

1614
01:31:10,680 --> 01:31:12,808
sent down to save
my wonderful life.

1615
01:31:24,840 --> 01:31:26,171
Merry Christmas.

1616
01:31:27,560 --> 01:31:28,607
Merry...

1617
01:31:35,440 --> 01:31:36,805
...Christmas.

1618
01:31:49,600 --> 01:31:50,600
Hey, Charlie.

1619
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:58,046
Lauren?

1620
01:31:58,120 --> 01:31:59,246
I got your text.

1621
01:32:01,160 --> 01:32:03,242
My...

1622
01:32:05,920 --> 01:32:08,969
Oh, yeah, no, of course.
Right, my text.

1623
01:32:09,040 --> 01:32:12,203
I text girls all the time.
That's what I do, you know.

1624
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:15,045
I didn't think
you were gonna come.

1625
01:32:15,120 --> 01:32:16,326
It's Christmas Eve.

1626
01:32:16,400 --> 01:32:17,890
Oh, no. It's no big deal.

1627
01:32:17,960 --> 01:32:20,964
We're Jewish, so, we were
just getting Chinese food, so...

1628
01:32:27,800 --> 01:32:30,724
Take your coat off and everything,
these are my parents right there.

1629
01:32:33,160 --> 01:32:35,162
Well...
Maybe we should...

1630
01:32:36,160 --> 01:32:37,764
give them a little privacy.

1631
01:32:37,840 --> 01:32:40,081
Yes, that's probably
a good idea.

1632
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:43,044
Bo, Bo, come here.

1633
01:32:43,160 --> 01:32:44,764
Why don't we go over
here for little bit?

1634
01:32:44,840 --> 01:32:46,126
Come over here, honey.

1635
01:32:49,240 --> 01:32:51,129
Stop staring.
I can't stop.

1636
01:32:53,680 --> 01:32:58,561
Last year, the 3rd grade class
picture came out all squinty.

1637
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:00,563
They're interviewing
Bud Bartlett, but

1638
01:33:00,640 --> 01:33:04,440
he doesn't care about
getting a good shot.

1639
01:33:04,520 --> 01:33:07,205
I could talk
to the principal and...

1640
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:12,801
Bo told me tonight.

1641
01:33:17,840 --> 01:33:20,889
I actually have to go,
I'm sorry.

1642
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:23,281
I promised my boyfriend
that I'd meet his family.

1643
01:33:23,360 --> 01:33:25,761
Yeah, yeah.

1644
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,604
Yeah, you should get going.

1645
01:33:28,720 --> 01:33:30,165
And, Angie, I...

1646
01:33:32,480 --> 01:33:34,289
I want you to be happy.

1647
01:33:39,960 --> 01:33:43,362
Oh, God, what is that?

1648
01:33:43,440 --> 01:33:45,568
I, ugh...

1649
01:33:45,680 --> 01:33:47,921
There goes the tree.

1650
01:33:48,000 --> 01:33:50,446
Should we intervene?
They need a referee?

1651
01:33:50,560 --> 01:33:52,280
- It's disturbing.
- It's not safe.

1652
01:34:22,600 --> 01:34:25,251
Can I tell you something,
without knowing anything about you?

1653
01:34:27,320 --> 01:34:28,526
I think you need Jello.

1654
01:34:32,200 --> 01:34:33,850
You have his smile.

1655
01:34:36,520 --> 01:34:37,567
I got lucky.

1656
01:34:49,160 --> 01:34:51,242
You know, I think that

1657
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:53,641
your hands were the first thing
I loved about you.

1658
01:34:57,480 --> 01:34:58,766
I'm gonna miss them.

1659
01:35:01,080 --> 01:35:05,768
I think, at first, I held on
so tight to the kids because

1660
01:35:07,320 --> 01:35:10,005
of all that we went through
and how much I loved them.

1661
01:35:11,240 --> 01:35:12,240
But now...

1662
01:35:14,080 --> 01:35:16,811
I think I'm holding on
because...

1663
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:19,451
I don't know who I am
if I don't.

1664
01:35:21,760 --> 01:35:23,364
My love for them...

1665
01:35:25,200 --> 01:35:28,488
it's so huge.
I kinda got lost in it, you know?

1666
01:35:30,840 --> 01:35:32,922
And a part of me,
like you said...

1667
01:35:34,120 --> 01:35:36,088
A part of me got small.
No.

1668
01:35:36,160 --> 01:35:37,605
You're not small.

1669
01:35:37,680 --> 01:35:40,445
I didn't even agree
with me when I said it.

1670
01:35:40,520 --> 01:35:42,090
You're beautiful and ridiculous.

1671
01:35:42,160 --> 01:35:43,730
No.

1672
01:35:43,840 --> 01:35:46,491
And as passionate
as you always were.

1673
01:35:48,000 --> 01:35:49,729
It's about different things now.

1674
01:35:49,800 --> 01:35:51,040
Yeah.

1675
01:35:52,240 --> 01:35:54,561
We had a great run,
Charlotte.

1676
01:35:56,320 --> 01:35:57,810
Nobody can say
we didn't try.

1677
01:35:57,880 --> 01:35:59,325
No, we tried.

1678
01:36:06,320 --> 01:36:07,765
Let's go on the trip.

1679
01:36:07,840 --> 01:36:09,330
You don't have to.

1680
01:36:09,400 --> 01:36:11,846
No, look at me, honey,
I want to go with you.

1681
01:36:14,800 --> 01:36:15,800
Really?

1682
01:36:17,440 --> 01:36:19,363
That's incredible.

1683
01:36:21,640 --> 01:36:24,723
Oh, Charlotte...

1684
01:36:24,840 --> 01:36:26,888
I don't really know
if we should go to Africa.

1685
01:36:27,480 --> 01:36:28,970
What?

1686
01:36:29,040 --> 01:36:30,485
Bo said Hank got laid off.

1687
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:32,767
Oh, my God, I knew it.

1688
01:36:32,840 --> 01:36:34,285
The tell tale snort.

1689
01:36:34,360 --> 01:36:35,805
That snort.

1690
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:38,087
But, I can...

1691
01:36:38,160 --> 01:36:41,050
take you out to
a really amazing dinner.

1692
01:36:41,120 --> 01:36:44,044
We could go to some
fancy Ethiopian place

1693
01:36:44,120 --> 01:36:45,645
with native dress.

1694
01:36:45,720 --> 01:36:48,883
You can take me to IHOP,
for all I care.

1695
01:36:48,960 --> 01:36:49,960
Yeah, me too.

1696
01:36:54,920 --> 01:36:56,126
Oh, my...

1697
01:36:58,760 --> 01:37:01,286
Hi, Sam.
Hi.

1698
01:37:20,600 --> 01:37:23,046
Good for them.

1699
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:27,444
Why waste a moment?
We're here for such a short time.

1700
01:37:52,160 --> 01:37:57,007
I need a last minute gift that
doesn't involve teddy bears,

1701
01:37:57,080 --> 01:38:00,402
balloons or pictures
of children with big eyes.

1702
01:38:00,520 --> 01:38:01,931
You can never
go wrong with chocolate.

1703
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:03,604
No.

1704
01:38:03,680 --> 01:38:08,163
Get me the most expensive thing
that you have.

1705
01:38:12,560 --> 01:38:15,803
You shouldn't have done this.
I feel so ridiculous.

1706
01:38:15,880 --> 01:38:17,086
Here we go. Oh!

1707
01:38:20,480 --> 01:38:21,766
Emma, no!

1708
01:38:21,840 --> 01:38:23,205
No, look...

1709
01:38:23,280 --> 01:38:25,009
What?

1710
01:38:25,080 --> 01:38:28,527
That's the most expensive
thing they had.

1711
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:31,803
I really like it.

1712
01:38:31,880 --> 01:38:34,850
'Cause what says Christmas
better than a shower seat?

1713
01:38:34,920 --> 01:38:36,251
Exactly. Well said.

1714
01:38:36,320 --> 01:38:39,005
I could really use
that shower seat.

1715
01:38:41,280 --> 01:38:44,170

1716

in the closeness</i>

1727
01:39:47,320 --> 01:39:51,041
<i>brought on by the time
well spent on the trip not yet taken.</i>

1728
01:39:55,080 --> 01:39:56,525
I still got it.

1729
01:40:08,360 --> 01:40:09,600
I've never seen that.

1730
01:40:09,680 --> 01:40:11,240
Are they are really doing this?

1731
01:40:14,880 --> 01:40:17,963
<i>Eleanor let go of her past
enough to be in the present.</i>

1732
01:40:21,480 --> 01:40:23,528
<i>Instead of trying to present
the perfect picture,</i>

1733
01:40:23,600 --> 01:40:26,365
<i>Hank celebrated this moment
un-photoshopped.</i>

1734
01:40:29,240 --> 01:40:30,810
Do you want to dance?

1735
01:40:30,920 --> 01:40:32,570
Me?

1736
01:40:32,640 --> 01:40:34,961
<i>Hank and Ruby took
their first step on the right foot.</i>

1737
01:40:37,120 --> 01:40:39,964
<i>All the more meaningful,
because Bucky had led them to it.</i>

1738
01:40:43,120 --> 01:40:44,963
Whoo!

1739
01:41:13,640 --> 01:41:16,450
<i>And Charlie would always
remember his first kiss.</i>

1740
01:41:16,520 --> 01:41:20,286
<i>His sloppy, awkward,
but very first kiss.</i>

1741
01:41:21,640 --> 01:41:24,007
You look pretty, Emma.
Do you want to dance?

1742
01:41:24,080 --> 01:41:25,411
Gosh, I would love to dance.

1743
01:41:25,480 --> 01:41:27,403
I would really love to dance.

1744
01:41:27,480 --> 01:41:31,007
<i>Emma finally recognized she was
already part of a large family.</i>

1745
01:41:34,600 --> 01:41:37,649
As Bucky stood, taking them in,
<i>his family unaware of him,</i>

1746
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:39,290
<i>this thought entered his head,</i>

1747
01:41:39,360 --> 01:41:41,442
<i>which he shared with
a large Haitian orderly.</i>

1748
01:41:42,160 --> 01:41:44,640
Such a fuss...

1749
01:41:44,720 --> 01:41:49,089
when everything we want is right
in front of us the whole time.

1750
01:41:49,160 --> 01:41:53,165
<i>And at last, everyone
appreciated that very sentiment.</i>

1751
01:41:53,240 --> 01:41:56,050
<i>Why is it they can never
remember that?</i>

1752
01:41:56,120 --> 01:42:00,842
<i>Or maybe the point is, even
just for a moment, they do.</i>

1753
01:42:06,280 --> 01:42:08,328
<i>Well, that's my tale.</i>

1754
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:13,722
<i>Sometimes, I wonder about
all the families sharing dinner together.</i>

1755
01:42:14,480 --> 01:42:15,480
<i>Each house,</i>

1756
01:42:16,960 --> 01:42:17,960
<i>each family,</i>

1757
01:42:19,800 --> 01:42:21,689
<i>each one with stories
of their own.</i>

1758
01:42:23,280 --> 01:42:26,682
<i>I don't know who chooses
our families for us.</i>

1759
01:42:26,760 --> 01:42:29,764
<i>Or if there's a reason
we land where we do.</i>

1760
01:42:29,840 --> 01:42:32,525
<i>But my family
will be home soon.</i>

1761
01:42:32,600 --> 01:42:35,251
<i>Loyal and affectionate,
but untrainable.</i>

1762
01:42:36,160 --> 01:42:38,527
<i>Perfectly imperfect.</i>

1763
01:42:38,600 --> 01:42:39,931
<i>They're only human.</i>

1764
01:42:41,400 --> 01:42:43,323
<i>And that's enough for me.</i>

1765
01:42:43,400 --> 01:42:46,051
<i>Merry Christmas to all. Woof!</i>

1766
01:45:38,080 --> 01:45:41,323
One, two,
you know what to do.

1767
01:46:27,200 --> 01:46:30,647
Round young virgin...
