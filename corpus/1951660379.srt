1
00:00:51,384 --> 00:00:54,687
It's said that the west was built
on the legends.

2
00:00:54,687 --> 00:00:57,624
Tall tales that help us
make sense of things.

3
00:00:57,624 --> 00:01:01,993
Too great, or too terrified to believe.

4
00:01:02,128 --> 00:01:05,529
This is the legend of the Ghost Rider.

5
00:01:15,175 --> 00:01:19,245
Story goes that every generation has one.

6
00:01:19,245 --> 00:01:23,516
Some damned soul cursed
to ride the earth.

7
00:01:23,516 --> 00:01:26,883
Collecting on the devils' deals.

8
00:01:29,589 --> 00:01:35,027
Many years ago, a ghost rider was sent
to the village of...

9
00:01:35,328 --> 00:01:40,391
To fetch a contract with
a thousand evil souls.

10
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:44,663
But that contract was so powerful.

11
00:01:47,173 --> 00:01:52,406
He knew he could never let the devil
gets his hands on it.

12
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:57,812
So he did what no rider has
ever done before.

13
00:02:01,754 --> 00:02:06,123
He outran the devil himself.

14
00:02:09,762 --> 00:02:12,532
The thing about legend is--

15
00:02:12,532 --> 00:02:16,332
Sometimes, they are true.

16
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:55,500
''GHOST RlDER''

17
00:03:02,949 --> 00:03:05,351
Ladies and gentlemen,

18
00:03:05,351 --> 00:03:12,484
The amazing racing is driving
circles spectacular.

19
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:37,614
How about a big applause to
Mack and Johnny Blaze.

20
00:03:50,597 --> 00:03:52,997
It's a hard shot, aged boy.

21
00:03:53,499 --> 00:03:56,525
Yeah, you think you've been there, no?

22
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:59,294
You do think they're thinking.

23
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:01,841
You ain't making the choice.
The choice's making you.

24
00:04:01,841 --> 00:04:05,242
How is this doing for the crowd?
I don't know why you've done it.

25
00:04:07,714 --> 00:04:11,980
You think she's gonna stand by you
when you're in the wheelchair, huh?

26
00:04:13,786 --> 00:04:16,186
Huh, hard shot?

27
00:04:29,202 --> 00:04:32,729
''J R FOREVER''

28
00:04:46,185 --> 00:04:48,847
Hey.

29
00:04:50,623 --> 00:04:54,320
What's wrong, Roxanne?

30
00:04:54,761 --> 00:04:57,030
I知 leaving.

31
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:58,131What?

32
00:04:58,131 --> 00:05:02,295
My dad's sending me to leave with my mum.

33
00:05:04,103 --> 00:05:07,903
When?
-Soon.

34
00:05:08,574 --> 00:05:10,543
What about us?

35
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:13,246
He says you're not good enough for me.

36
00:05:13,246 --> 00:05:16,738
That you're just a farce.

37
00:05:16,983 --> 00:05:20,214
So what are we gonna do, Johnny?

38
00:05:22,288 --> 00:05:24,424
We'll leave.

39
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:27,257
We'll jump on the back and
just keep going.

40
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:29,429
But what about your dad?
What about the show?

41
00:05:29,429 --> 00:05:33,229
He doesn't need me.
He doesn't need anybody.

42
00:05:33,433 --> 00:05:36,493
Tomorrow noon, we'll meet here.

43
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:39,022
''...the cancer has spread...''

44
00:07:03,623 --> 00:07:05,825
Johnny Blaze?

45
00:07:05,825 --> 00:07:07,292
Yeah.

46
00:07:10,029 --> 00:07:14,434
...To come to tell you how much
I enjoyed watching your ride.

47
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:16,035
Oh, thanks.

48
00:07:16,035 --> 00:07:18,905
Perhaps you'd ride for me one day.

49
00:07:18,905 --> 00:07:20,873
You own a show?

50
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:23,137
Crazy show on earth.
51
00:07:28,881 --> 00:07:31,509
Thanks. But no, thanks.

52
00:07:34,754 --> 00:07:41,318
What's wrong, Johnny?
Worried about your father?

53
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:46,794
What do you know that?
-He's gonna blend...

54
00:07:48,267 --> 00:07:52,371
Think about the chance and
the time he takes.

55
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:54,896
The tall loved ones.

56
00:07:56,576 --> 00:08:02,606
Johnny, what if I could help your dad?

57
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:04,784
Yeah. How?

58
00:08:04,784 --> 00:08:07,548
''How'' is not important.

59
00:08:07,620 --> 00:08:14,321
What if I could make him better?
Heal him back his health.

60
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:18,756
Would you be willing to make a deal?

61
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:22,664
Name me a price.

62
00:08:25,471 --> 00:08:27,996
I'll take--

63
00:08:31,077 --> 00:08:34,046
Your soul.

64
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:41,888
Okay.
-By sunrise tomorrow,

65
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:45,415
your father will be healthy as a horse.

66
00:08:45,591 --> 00:08:51,587
All you have to do is -- sign.

67
00:09:12,919 --> 00:09:17,219
Oh, that--that will do just fine.

68
00:09:24,063 --> 00:09:25,997
Damn.

69
00:09:28,768 --> 00:09:31,430
Morning, sleeping beauty.

70
00:09:31,704 --> 00:09:33,467
Dad?

71
00:09:33,973 --> 00:09:36,237
You look--
-Great, right?

72
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:40,411
Exact as what the doc said when we
were looking at the X-ray this morning.

73
00:09:40,846 --> 00:09:43,215
What are you talking about?
-Private 6, huh?

74
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:45,418
We finally get up the nerve
to tell you about it.

75
00:09:45,418 --> 00:09:47,486
I'm not anymore.

76
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:50,944
I can't explain it. But I feel healthy
as a horse.

77
00:09:51,123 --> 00:09:54,327
Now, come on, Hard Shot.
I got a show to do.

78
00:09:54,327 --> 00:09:57,854
I'll get them vibrate. I don't want to
keep those people wait.

79
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,370
Ladies and gentlemen,

80
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,134
Marcus Blaze.

81
00:10:26,626 --> 00:10:28,856
Ladies and gentlemen...

82
00:10:29,729 --> 00:10:31,597
Please stay calm.

83
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:34,400
Dad! Dad, it's alright. I知 here.

84
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:35,801
I知 here to help you, okay?

85
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,496
Dad.

86
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:43,365
Dad! Dad!

87
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:28,787
You're not good to be dead.

88
00:11:40,866 --> 00:11:42,368
You--

89
00:11:42,368 --> 00:11:43,969
You killed him!

90
00:11:43,969 --> 00:11:47,336
I cured his cancer.

91
00:11:47,573 --> 00:11:50,098
That was the deal.

92
00:11:50,342 --> 00:11:53,612
But I couldn't let him come between us.

93
00:11:53,612 --> 00:11:55,876
You son of the bitch!

94
00:11:57,283 --> 00:12:01,083
One day, when I need you--

95
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,311
I will come.

96
00:12:03,556 --> 00:12:06,582
Until then, I値l be--

9700:12:07,126 --> 00:12:09,993
I値l be watching you.

98
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,088
Forget about friends.

99
00:12:13,966 --> 00:12:16,662
Forget about family.

100
00:12:16,936 --> 00:12:20,372
Forget about love.

101
00:12:25,144 --> 00:12:29,706
You're mine, Johnny Blaze.

102
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:20,227
You can't let them share.
You can't let them share.

103
00:13:52,898 --> 00:13:54,866
Yeah, Johnny. Yeah!

104
00:14:46,552 --> 00:14:48,854
Ladies and gentlemen,
please get off the deal

105
00:14:48,854 --> 00:14:50,412
to allow paramedics through.

106
00:14:51,090 --> 00:14:53,217
Oh God! Oh God!
-JB.

107
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,993
JB, talk to me, man!

108
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:11,537
Hack, is my bone go cunned?

109
00:15:12,378 --> 00:15:18,544
Yeah. Yeah. But it's fine.
-Oh God.

110
00:15:20,552 --> 00:15:22,452
Thank you.

111
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:24,923
Let's go.

112
00:15:26,659 --> 00:15:31,995
They are here for go.
The amazing Johnny Blaze.

113
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:40,332
''Welcome to Texas''

114
00:15:53,052 --> 00:15:54,246
Yeah, come on, go!

115
00:15:55,421 --> 00:15:57,823
Make the front and deal--
Damn it!

116
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:58,824
Gressil is down.

117
00:15:58,824 --> 00:16:02,089
Do you train not to crash it?
-Have you?

118
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:06,465
Why don't you have a beer, relax
like everybody else, huh?

119
00:16:06,465 --> 00:16:08,899
You know alcohol gives me nightmares.

120
00:16:12,438 --> 00:16:13,803
Game is on.

121
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,615
Wait--Wait--Can you go back?
There's a hell of monkeys

122
00:16:23,615 --> 00:16:25,242
on discovery channel tonight.

123
00:16:25,517 --> 00:16:26,950
Guys, hey!

124
00:16:28,420 --> 00:16:30,756
''...But I see it's a rider who
they looked up to.''

125
00:16:30,756 --> 00:16:33,392
''And answer the man who's not even
competing here.''

126
00:16:33,392 --> 00:16:34,994
''Johnny Blaze!''

127
00:16:34,994 --> 00:16:38,589
Yeah, cause he's right here.

128
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:42,067
''But what we don't know is how much
longer could Blaze cheat death.''

129
00:16:42,067 --> 00:16:44,900
His critics called the papers--
-Get the Monkey Show on that.

130
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,972
Mack, the Monkey Show.
-Shhh!

131
00:16:46,972 --> 00:16:49,308
''...each jump was similarly
not regard for his own life.''

132
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,310
''They call it, Mr Invisible.''

133
00:16:51,310 --> 00:16:54,446
''They don't have to be on the next jump
while Johnny Blaze attempted...''

134
00:16:54,446 --> 00:16:57,438
''...from few goal to few goal--''

135
00:17:05,157 --> 00:17:07,352
What?

136
00:17:07,860 --> 00:17:09,728
What?

137
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:13,027
You should be taking a dirt nap after
that ragdoll today.

138
00:17:13,265 --> 00:17:14,500
I got lucky.

139
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:18,630
I致e got a Han dog named Lucky--
he's got one eye and no nuts.

140
00:17:18,837 --> 00:17:20,737
Lucky don't cover it, JB.

141
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:23,075
You got an angel looking after you.

142
00:17:23,075 --> 00:17:24,443
Yeah, maybe.

143
00:17:24,443 --> 00:17:26,377
Mack, are you in?

144
00:17:27,312 --> 00:17:30,883
Yeah. Yeah, I知 in.
Screw over, ladies.

145
00:17:30,883 --> 00:17:32,151
What's in it?

146
00:17:32,151 --> 00:17:35,086
5 heart draw...
-Maybe the soon is ours soon.

147
00:18:20,032 --> 00:18:21,624
There you go.

148
00:18:21,900 --> 00:18:23,697
It took you long enough.

149
00:18:40,385 --> 00:18:43,252
I think you might be lost, boy.

150
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:48,152
Angel's only in there.
-Angels? Really?

151
00:18:48,594 --> 00:18:50,462
Yeah, really.

152
00:18:50,462 --> 00:18:53,363
You got a problem with that?

153
00:18:53,732 --> 00:18:55,461
As a matter of fact--

154
00:19:11,517 --> 00:19:13,417
I do.

155
00:19:20,626 --> 00:19:23,322
Yeah, I知 in the neighborhood, Johnny.

156
00:19:23,562 --> 00:19:26,429
Enjoy the harmonic association yet?

157
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:29,468
Oh, I see you still haven't got
the lock through your life.

158
00:19:29,468 --> 00:19:32,304
That's great. Great. You got a lot of
expense on bikes in here, man.

159
00:19:32,304 --> 00:19:35,068
I told you, how many times.

160
00:19:35,707 --> 00:19:38,443
Well, JB, said it before.
I値l say it again.

161
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:41,241
This place could use woman's touch.

162
00:19:41,346 --> 00:19:44,110
So could you turn back?

163
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:50,184
Alright, 4 out of 5.
Rack one more, you'll get the whole set.

164
00:19:53,792 --> 00:19:56,528
I知 glad to see you finally
use on your books.

165
00:19:56,528 --> 00:19:58,030
You want some jellies?

166
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:01,261
No. I don't want none of
your stupid candy.

167
00:20:05,504 --> 00:20:07,973
Actually I want to talk about
some kind of serious.

168
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,042
I知 trying to relax, Mack.
-Yeah, I understand.

169
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,602
Alright. It's just gonna take a second.

170
00:20:17,849 --> 00:20:21,580
It's about you jump on the anniversary
of your dad's accident.

171
00:20:24,590 --> 00:20:27,889
Can--can I just turn this music off
for a minute?

172
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,960
This jump, man. We--

173
00:20:34,099 --> 00:20:37,336
Mack, you touch the cabinets
or to change video again,

174
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:40,271
we're gonna scape on our hands.
-This jump is nuts.

175
00:20:40,539 --> 00:20:42,507
Alright, man. I mean
few goal to few goal.

176
00:20:42,507 --> 00:20:44,941
Now you're hitting cars. I mean--

177
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:48,044
What are you trying to prove?

178
00:20:48,347 --> 00:20:49,848
That's me.

179
00:20:49,848 --> 00:20:51,550
That's you?

180
00:20:51,550 --> 00:20:53,415
Ride on a bike.

181
00:20:53,585 --> 00:20:56,145
Of course it's you. Who the hell
else's gonna be?

182
00:20:56,388 --> 00:20:58,156
You know you're freaking me out.

183
00:20:58,156 --> 00:21:00,359
You're freaking me out because
you're reading this--

184
00:21:00,359 --> 00:21:03,351
compared exponential relic geocity crap.

185
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:06,695
It's getting in your brain.

186
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:09,999
What's going on, man?

187
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:13,305
Do you believe people
get second chances?

188
00:21:13,305 --> 00:21:14,573
I don't know.

189
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:18,510
lf somebody makes a mistake,
a big mistake--

190
00:21:18,510 --> 00:21:21,513
Do you think that person
should have to pay for it everyday

191
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:23,515
for the rest of their lives.

192
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:26,814
Are you talking about your daddy's
accident?

193
00:21:27,352 --> 00:21:29,718
Well--

194
00:21:30,722 --> 00:21:33,122
I was just looking for a sign.

195
00:21:33,358 --> 00:21:35,952
What kind of sign?

196
00:21:36,428 --> 00:21:39,264
That I can take a negative and
turn into a positive.

197
00:21:39,264 --> 00:21:42,631
That I can have a second chance too.

198
00:21:42,868 --> 00:21:48,033
Look, at least promise me
you'll think about taking the cars out.

199
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,639
I値l think about it.

200
00:22:37,723 --> 00:22:39,458
I knew you were here.

201
00:22:39,458 --> 00:22:42,518
I can smell you're here.

202
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,307
Hello, Gressil.

203
00:22:59,678 --> 00:23:02,511
Why are you here?

204
00:23:07,853 --> 00:23:09,821
Wallow.

205
00:23:13,558 --> 00:23:15,627
What do you want from us?

206
00:23:15,627 --> 00:23:18,926
I致e come for the contract
to send the guns in.

207
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,767
That it's said that the contract
was stolen and hidden

208
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:24,102
on the graveyard not far from here.

209
00:23:24,102 --> 00:23:26,002
Now you can help me to find it.

210
00:23:30,475 --> 00:23:32,344
Abigor.

211
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,679
And when we find it, then what?

212
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:36,915
Then we'll take this world.

213
00:23:36,915 --> 00:23:39,543
One city--

214
00:23:40,419 --> 00:23:42,020
At a time.

215
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:44,648
How about Mephistopheles?

216
00:23:49,895 --> 00:23:54,923
Don't ever say that name!

217
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:04,436
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to
the Johnny Blaze's legal jump.

218
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:10,037
Yeah...!

219
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:15,415
Yeah, baby, go...! Jump!

220
00:24:23,728 --> 00:24:25,997
Hey, JB.
-Shh.

221
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:28,761
You're stepping on Karen.

222
00:24:32,771 --> 00:24:35,296
What was that you're gonna say, man?

223
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:39,032
I just tried the second check
on the lap so it'd look good.

224
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:42,846
Crowd's kind of out of control.

225
00:24:43,048 --> 00:24:46,540
Johnny, you know you don't have
to do this, don't you?

226
00:24:48,253 --> 00:24:51,916
Is this suit feel alright?
It feels a little loose.

227
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,725
The suit's fine.

228
00:24:53,725 --> 00:24:58,059
Would you bring on my hat, Mack?
Thank you.

229
00:25:03,535 --> 00:25:06,333
You can't live in fair.

230
00:25:08,373 --> 00:25:10,141
Alright, JB. We just get you
on the right.

231
00:25:10,141 --> 00:25:12,177
Mr Blaze, any case of complexity,

232
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:14,012
I was wondering do you have time
for friends of you?

233
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,647
Look, I don't know how long you've
been doing your job, ma'am.

234
00:25:15,647 --> 00:25:17,349
But Johnny Blaze don't do
interviews, okay?

235
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,909
Not even for your old friend.

236
00:25:30,495 --> 00:25:32,554
Hey, Johnny.

237
00:25:35,734 --> 00:25:37,929
Hi.

238
00:25:38,970 --> 00:25:40,372
I値l do it.

239
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:45,544
Okay, and ready in 5, 4, 3, 2...

240
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:47,842
How's your dad?

241
00:25:48,113 --> 00:25:51,310
Johnny Blaze, thank you for talking
to us before your big jump.

242
00:25:51,716 --> 00:25:54,519
No one has ever attempted
such a distance.

243
00:25:54,519 --> 00:25:57,589
300 feet from few goal to few goal.

244
00:25:57,589 --> 00:26:00,191
What's going to your mind right now?

245
00:26:00,191 --> 00:26:01,693
You look really good.

246
00:26:01,693 --> 00:26:04,996
I致e seen you on TV. You know,
I watch a lot of TV.

247
00:26:04,996 --> 00:26:07,362
You do a really good job.

248
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,537
Johnny, what's right somebody to risk
their lives for entertainment?

249
00:26:12,537 --> 00:26:14,732
I heard you got married.

250
00:26:16,141 --> 00:26:20,100
No. Not about that thing.
-Oh, no-no.

251
00:26:22,180 --> 00:26:24,783
Most of the time, the press
focuses on the crashes,

252
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:27,519
the broken bones, the cost
on what you do.

253
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:29,817
Are there any other costs?

254
00:26:37,228 --> 00:26:39,458
Yeah.

255
00:26:42,267 --> 00:26:47,372
Okay, well. Thank you for this revealing
tip into the life of Johnny Blaze.

256
00:26:47,372 --> 00:26:50,141
I知 Roxanne Simpson on scene.

257
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:51,802
Yeah, well.

25800:26:52,544 --> 00:26:54,312
You're gonna stay for the jump,
aren't you?

259
00:26:54,312 --> 00:26:55,981
Oh, you know, we gotta get back.

260
00:26:55,981 --> 00:26:58,142
Plus I never let to be watching you jump.

261
00:27:05,890 --> 00:27:07,824
Roxanne.

262
00:27:22,374 --> 00:27:25,176
...said that you two have
some kind of history.

263
00:27:25,176 --> 00:27:27,007
That was it, Mack.

264
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:31,114
The sign.
-The sign?

265
00:27:32,250 --> 00:27:34,684
You sure you don't want to stick around?
-No.

266
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:36,750
He hasn't started yet.
-Uh-uh.

267
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:38,923
I値l buy you a doughnut.
-Uh-uh.

268
00:27:39,190 --> 00:27:41,593
Come on, Roxanne. It's Johnny Blaze.

269
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:43,028
Let's go.

270
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:44,462
Thank God you listened to me.

271
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:46,953
You took the cars out.
It would be suicide otherwise.

272
00:27:47,365 --> 00:27:49,634
This way, if you come out
short, so you'll--

273
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:54,094
come down on some nice, soft green--

274
00:27:55,707 --> 00:27:56,841
Grass.

275
00:27:56,841 --> 00:27:58,109
Ladies and gentlemen,

276
00:27:58,109 --> 00:28:01,146
Johnny Blaze will not be jumping 15 cars
today on schedule.

277
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:05,617
But instead he'll be leading 6
US60 Black Hawk Helicopter.

278
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:10,077
Never before has any man
has done such device stuff.

279
00:28:10,388 --> 00:28:13,186
I took the cars out.

280
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:19,497
Why? Why Johnny?
Why wouldn't you tell me?

281
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:21,299
Well, because you were the thrown feet.

28200:28:21,299 --> 00:28:22,734
Call me old fashioned,
I知 funny that way.

283
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:25,134
Human sacrifice makes me uncomfortable.

284
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:29,237
Why Johnny? Why helicopters, man?

285
00:28:29,674 --> 00:28:31,242
You know what I致e been thinking about?

286
00:28:31,242 --> 00:28:32,811
A new stunt.

287
00:28:32,811 --> 00:28:38,579
Instead of the cars in fire,
a helicopter.

288
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:43,476
My dad thought it would be cool.

289
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:47,688
He was right.
-Yeah.

290
00:28:48,293 --> 00:28:50,428
Okay. Okay. This is the deal, man.

291
00:28:50,428 --> 00:28:52,831
Half way down the ramp
I want you to hit the Nos. Okay?

292
00:28:52,831 --> 00:28:55,200
Do not hit the NOS too early,
if you hit it too early,

293
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,368
You're screwed, you got that?

294
00:28:57,368 --> 00:29:00,360
Hey, JB, where's your head at man?

295
00:29:00,572 --> 00:29:03,973
She's probably
in the inner state by now. Huh?

296
00:29:10,548 --> 00:29:12,317
How much NOS is put in the tank?

297
00:29:12,317 --> 00:29:13,818
Enough to spin the space shuttle.

298
00:29:13,818 --> 00:29:14,978
Mack.
-Chief, go ahead.

299
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,226
Oh God, he's gonna make it.

300
00:29:44,849 --> 00:29:46,612
He made it.

301
00:29:48,920 --> 00:29:51,756
I told you he'd make it.
Yeah, JB!

302
00:29:51,756 --> 00:29:53,391
Let's cheer for him,
ladies and gentlemen.

303
00:29:53,391 --> 00:29:57,328
300 feet of world record,
there's only Johnny Blaze can do.

304
00:29:57,328 --> 00:30:00,058
Yes. Yes.

305
00:30:06,471 --> 00:30:07,665
Where is he going?

306
00:30:08,006 --> 00:30:09,507
I said one thing about the guy.

307
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:10,975
He's got guts.

308
00:30:10,975 --> 00:30:13,678
I mean the other day I was watching
this some x-sport show...

309
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:16,943
Stuart, can you please stop talking
about Johnny Blaze already?

310
00:30:19,751 --> 00:30:23,551
Yeah. That might be a little hard.

311
00:30:25,456 --> 00:30:27,583
I made it.

312
00:30:28,393 --> 00:30:30,691
Pull over.

313
00:30:30,929 --> 00:30:31,930
You want me to pull over?

314
00:30:31,930 --> 00:30:34,125
Drive.
-Driving.

315
00:30:41,406 --> 00:30:44,739
Come on, Roxanne.
I need to talk to you.

316
00:30:53,751 --> 00:30:56,387
What's your name?
-What?

317
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:59,049
What's your name?
-Oh, Stuart.

318
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:01,659
Johnny.
-Hi.

319
00:31:01,659 --> 00:31:04,787
Well, Stuart, can you help me
outta here?

320
00:31:05,530 --> 00:31:08,658
Sorry, dude. She's the boss.

32100:31:09,801 --> 00:31:11,598
Johnny, look out.

322
00:31:20,378 --> 00:31:22,814
Alright. I guess I see
how it's gonna be.

323
00:31:22,814 --> 00:31:24,611
Hang on.

324
00:31:41,366 --> 00:31:43,868
Howdy. Howdy. Howdy.

325
00:31:43,868 --> 00:31:45,703
Are you trying to kill yourself?

326
00:31:45,703 --> 00:31:49,139
I wanna talk to you. I haven't seen you
is 56,000 years.

327
00:31:49,474 --> 00:31:51,309
This is crazy. You are crazy.

328
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:52,577
You know Johnny,
I don't have time for this.

329
00:31:52,577 --> 00:31:53,845
I have a story to edit.

330
00:31:53,845 --> 00:31:55,039
You couldn't say no.

331
00:31:56,014 --> 00:32:00,041
When I ask you to marry me.
You could've said no.

332
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,922
What are you trying to say?

333
00:32:03,922 --> 00:32:08,359
I知 not trying to say anything.
I知 saying I mean something.

334
00:32:08,359 --> 00:32:10,895
Sorry.
-You got my numbers, son.

33500:32:10,895 --> 00:32:13,131
You're on the side of the freeway.

336
00:32:13,131 --> 00:32:14,666
Let's get some dinner.

337
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:18,193
You still like attalia?

338
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,306
What's this about, Johnny?

339
00:32:21,306 --> 00:32:23,141
You want some closure?

340
00:32:23,141 --> 00:32:26,210
Look, you were 17, and you witnessed
a tragedy and you ran.

341
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:27,979
I understand now
like I understood then.

342
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:30,081
And I have no hard feelings,
none, you know.

343
00:32:30,081 --> 00:32:33,414
That's why they call it the past.
Cause it's past. It痴 done. It痴 over.

344
00:32:40,591 --> 00:32:42,616
Too much?

345
00:32:45,530 --> 00:32:48,863
There's a restaurant in my hotel,
The Plazuer.

346
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,761
8 o'clock.
-Yes.

347
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:58,443
Don't be late.
-This is the sun, Roxanne.

348
00:32:58,443 --> 00:33:02,004
There are no accidents.
Destiny and all that.

349
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:06,678
Johnny, Johnny, can you please sign
my sister's book?

350
00:33:07,018 --> 00:33:10,977
300 feet. For Maggie. 300 feet.

351
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,805
Mephistopheles.
352
00:33:27,805 --> 00:33:29,173
I knew you'd come.

353
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:31,767
Long time no see, boys.

354
00:33:32,276 --> 00:33:34,836
Where you been hiding?

355
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,914
I know why you're here.

356
00:33:36,914 --> 00:33:38,983
I know what you're after.

357
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:43,477
It痴 my contract.
They're my souls.

358
00:33:43,855 --> 00:33:46,691
We both know you can't harm me here.

359
00:33:46,691 --> 00:33:49,091
It痴 my turn to lead.

360
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:52,262
You will suffer for this.

361
00:33:52,630 --> 00:33:55,599
Now, deal with my rider.

362
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:59,598
Your favourite creation.
Send your precious rider.

363
00:33:59,804 --> 00:34:07,108
I will retire him, just like,
I will retire you. Father.

364
00:34:39,177 --> 00:34:41,873
You can't live in fear.

365
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:45,014
You can't live in fear.

366
00:34:45,316 --> 00:34:47,618
You made a job
no one's made their job.

367
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:50,178
You're the best rider.

368
00:34:52,256 --> 00:34:55,123
You deserve a second chance.

369
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,520
She's a sun.

370
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,533
Okay.

371
00:37:00,251 --> 00:37:01,616
Johnny.

372
00:37:02,687 --> 00:37:05,022
Stay away from me.

373
00:37:05,022 --> 00:37:07,047
A little late for that.

374
00:37:07,992 --> 00:37:10,893
Nice bike. Yeah.

375
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,297
Why are you here?

376
00:37:13,297 --> 00:37:17,097
Oh, I致e always been here, Johnny.

377
00:37:17,435 --> 00:37:18,800
All along.

378
00:37:19,036 --> 00:37:25,376
Phoenix. Tender. Justin.
-It was you.

379
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:28,879
Keeping me alive.
-No. No, Johnny.

380
00:37:28,879 --> 00:37:33,050
It痴 all you. You're the best.

381
00:37:33,050 --> 00:37:36,754
And I am your greatest fan.

382
00:37:36,754 --> 00:37:44,528
Posters. The video games.
The crowds. Screaming. Chanting.

383
00:37:44,528 --> 00:37:48,931
Johnny. Johnny.

384
00:37:49,300 --> 00:37:52,470
Johnny.

385
00:37:52,470 --> 00:37:55,906
You make me so proud.

386
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:02,947
It痴 like watching an investment
that keeps growing, and growing,

387
00:38:02,947 --> 00:38:07,885
Until the day, you cash it in.

388
00:38:07,885 --> 00:38:10,888
That day's the day, Johnny.

389
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:16,661
Find the one known as Blackheart.
And destroy him.

390
00:38:16,661 --> 00:38:18,492
Find him yourself.

391
00:38:19,297 --> 00:38:21,399
It doesn't work like that.

392
00:38:21,399 --> 00:38:24,391
You're under contract, remember.

393
00:38:25,469 --> 00:38:31,738
lf you succeed,
I値l return your soul.

394
00:38:32,009 --> 00:38:33,678
I知 not doing it.

395
00:38:33,678 --> 00:38:36,203
You don't have any choice.

396
00:39:46,217 --> 00:39:47,980
Hey.

397
00:39:48,319 --> 00:39:51,618
You can't come in here.
This is private...

398
00:39:54,291 --> 00:39:55,659
Property.

399
00:39:55,659 --> 00:40:00,998
There is a cemetery here.
-Yeah. Long time ago.

400
00:40:00,998 --> 00:40:03,967
What happened to the grave?

401
00:40:04,668 --> 00:40:09,162
They move them.
-Where?

402
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:14,538
I don't know.
-Who would?

403
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:21,343
St Michael's Church.
They're in charge of the whole thing.

404
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:24,711
Look, you really shouldn't be here.

405
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,452
That's what they keep telling me.

406
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:43,604
Oh God!

407
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:50,310
Oh God!

408
00:41:43,234 --> 00:41:45,498
Looking for someone?

409
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,732
Back to hell.

410
00:41:49,006 --> 00:41:52,203
We're not gonna have a meaning
for conversation now, are we?

411
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:55,240
You're going down.

412
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:57,510
I don't think so.

413
00:42:42,860 --> 00:42:45,055
He ain't so tough.

414
00:42:52,336 --> 00:42:55,430
Hey, do it back.

415
00:43:06,884 --> 00:43:08,185
Have mercy.

416
00:43:08,185 --> 00:43:11,643
Sorry, all out of mercy.

417
00:43:25,069 --> 00:43:27,299
Help me.

418
00:44:21,759 --> 00:44:23,249
Wait.

419
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:26,462
You think I知 pretty right?

420
00:44:36,940 --> 00:44:39,738
Give me the damn bag.
-Help!

421
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:43,508
Help!

422
00:44:54,091 --> 00:44:55,820
Thanks.

423
00:44:59,263 --> 00:45:03,495
You guilty.

424
00:45:07,004 --> 00:45:15,979
Look into my eyes.

425
00:45:15,979 --> 00:45:20,541
Your soul is stain
by the blood of the innocents.

426
00:45:21,118 --> 00:45:23,848
Feel their pain.

427
00:45:33,931 --> 00:45:35,455
Let me go!

428
00:47:13,697 --> 00:47:16,029
Morning, Bone Head.

429
00:49:27,698 --> 00:49:31,794
They've seen you now.
They'll be waiting for you.

430
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:35,172
lf you need my help,
expect the last of that.

431
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:38,630
Last time another stranger help me,
I didn't pay an ass of it.

432
00:49:38,875 --> 00:49:41,400
Said son you can't ran from, kid.

433
00:49:41,678 --> 00:49:44,841
He'd still be coming
since you made that deal.

434
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:55,083
Congratulations.

435
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:58,556
Chances this weapon mind the smill.

436
00:49:58,795 --> 00:50:01,798
Sources close to the investigations
say that there maybe a link...

437
00:50:01,798 --> 00:50:03,800
...between what happened here in downtown...

438
00:50:03,800 --> 00:50:06,303
Are the broken book's
massacre in the desert.

439
00:50:06,303 --> 00:50:10,672
I知 Roxanne Simpson, on scene.
-And we're out.

440
00:50:12,242 --> 00:50:13,677
Captain Dolan.
-No comment.

441
00:50:13,677 --> 00:50:16,146
Is it true they found a connection
between the biker bar massacre...

442
00:50:16,146 --> 00:50:18,740
...and last night victims
here in the city train yards?

443
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:24,851
No comment.

444
00:50:26,857 --> 00:50:29,087
Off the record, captain.

445
00:50:31,161 --> 00:50:35,291
Off the record?
Piss off.

44600:50:39,202 --> 00:50:43,036
Rider's are devil痴 baddier.

447
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:47,367
Sent to hunt down anyone
escape from hell.

448
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:49,980
Sterilize that for me.

449
00:50:49,980 --> 00:50:51,709
Sterilize.

450
00:50:56,953 --> 00:51:01,083
In boiling water.
-Right.

451
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:03,719
Lock in fears.

452
00:51:04,694 --> 00:51:07,561
During the day you'll be normal.

453
00:51:07,931 --> 00:51:16,039
In the night, in the presence of evil,
the rider takes over.

454
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:20,373
I remember now.
Last night...

455
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:29,543
There was some punk and I could see
all the wrong he ever done.

456
00:51:29,853 --> 00:51:32,720
Turn it all against him.

457
00:51:32,989 --> 00:51:35,423
The blood in stare.

458
00:51:35,859 --> 00:51:39,563
Shear the souls in looking.

459
00:51:39,563 --> 00:51:42,532
It痴 the ghost rider greatest weapon.

460
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:45,933
All the riders have it.

461
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:51,475
And there are others, guess not,
ghost rider problem?

462
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:53,110
Yes, it is.

463
00:51:53,110 --> 00:51:56,273
Last one was a 150 years ago.

464
00:51:56,613 --> 00:52:02,574
It will take all shame and guns,
just down.

465
00:52:02,819 --> 00:52:04,654
There's people.

466
00:52:04,654 --> 00:52:08,021
Guess the rider kill all
who make the promises.

467
00:52:08,258 --> 00:52:12,462
On due at the time,
consumed by greed,

468
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,931
They turned over another.

469
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:19,803
Until the villagers send them Gods
are drowned in it痴 own blood.

470
00:52:19,803 --> 00:52:24,875
Souls. Slept forever
in God's forsaken place.

471
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:28,367
What's this has to do with Blackheart?

472
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:31,545
Blackheart?

473
00:52:31,982 --> 00:52:34,851
He sent you out for Blackheart?

474
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:38,947
And others?
-They're hidden.

475
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:42,488
All the name that was cast
out of hell in brime.

476
00:52:42,726 --> 00:52:45,061
Save Michael himself.

477
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:51,261
They hide within the other months.
Waiting. For the end of days.

478
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:56,335
You better hang around here, kid.

479
00:52:57,274 --> 00:53:01,506
They kept come on the hell of ground.

480
00:53:01,845 --> 00:53:03,413
Thanks.

481
00:53:03,413 --> 00:53:05,048
And thanks for the info.

482
00:53:05,048 --> 00:53:08,779
I feel much better now that I know
the devil痴 bound to other.

483
00:53:11,121 --> 00:53:14,391
Where you going?
-Somebody I gotta see.

484
00:53:14,391 --> 00:53:17,258
It痴 a bad idea.

485
00:53:17,727 --> 00:53:20,560
Wouldn't be my first.

486
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,560
How did you do it?

487
00:53:28,004 --> 00:53:30,131
How did you make the deal?

488
00:53:30,373 --> 00:53:35,868
I was a kid.
-What did you get in return?

489
00:53:38,982 --> 00:53:41,450
Heartache.

490
00:53:50,093 --> 00:53:52,186
Oh my God.

491
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:02,436
It痴 hard to describe the destruction...

492
00:54:08,278 --> 00:54:10,580
Could you tell us about
the good Samaritan?

493
00:54:10,580 --> 00:54:13,250
Oh, I値l never forget him
that's for sure.

494
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:17,754
He was tall, broad shoulders,
and thin, very thin, like boney.

495
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:21,451
And he have this red chopper
that was on flame and stuff.

496
00:54:21,725 --> 00:54:27,857
Oh, and his face was a skull,
and it was on fire.

497
00:54:29,899 --> 00:54:33,926
On fire?
-Yeah, like...

498
00:54:35,572 --> 00:54:38,742
Like that much fire.
And I know it sounds weird,

499
00:54:38,742 --> 00:54:40,577
But it look okay on him.

500
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:45,241
I mean, it was an edge look,
but he totally pull it off.

501
00:54:46,383 --> 00:54:48,977
Not sure what's had to that.

502
00:54:49,286 --> 00:54:52,346
I知 Roxanne Simpson, on scene.

503
00:54:53,290 --> 00:54:55,155
Thanks.

504
00:55:01,665 --> 00:55:03,792
Roxy.
-Don't.

505
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:06,703
You know, hold on a second.
Let me apologize.

506
00:55:06,703 --> 00:55:09,638
Last night was an excusable.
-No apology.

507
00:55:09,906 --> 00:55:12,670
See. You did me a favour last night.

508
00:55:12,876 --> 00:55:16,546
Because you make me think of then,
now and when you left.

509
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:18,848
Yeah. Great like hell.
But you know what?

510
00:55:18,848 --> 00:55:20,550
I got over it.

511
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:23,451
I went to college. I got a great job.

512
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:28,350
But you, Johnny...
You're just the same.

513
00:55:28,591 --> 00:55:31,227
Oh, better pay, and more fans.

514
00:55:31,227 --> 00:55:34,788
But you're still just a carnie.

515
00:55:38,335 --> 00:55:42,169
Yeah.
-Oh, man.

516
00:55:42,439 --> 00:55:47,843
My dad was right.
You're just a fiends.

517
00:55:52,782 --> 00:55:54,477
Melt like well.

518
00:55:58,988 --> 00:56:01,650
Hey, Captain. I got something.

519
00:56:57,714 --> 00:57:00,945
On the days.

520
00:57:03,853 --> 00:57:10,326
A host can gain control the possessing
spirit through concentration on...

521
00:57:10,326 --> 00:57:17,027
...a manipulation of the fire element
and exists within man.

522
00:57:26,142 --> 00:57:30,442
Now I知 speaking to the fire element
within me.

523
00:57:30,513 --> 00:57:36,281
Give me control
for the possessing spirit.

524
00:57:55,672 --> 00:57:57,273
Hi.
-Hi.

525
00:57:57,273 --> 00:58:00,504
Hey. I hope you don't mind.
Your lift was open.

526
00:58:00,777 --> 00:58:02,438
Wow.

527
00:58:03,279 --> 00:58:08,683
I came to apologize.
I知 leaving town tonight, and...

528
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:12,820
I didn't want what I said today
to be the last words between us.

529
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:16,058
That's okay.
-No, it's not.

530
00:58:16,793 --> 00:58:22,432
It was cruel, and totally untrue,
and I feel very terrible about it.

531
00:58:22,432 --> 00:58:25,833
Please, don't. It痴 okay.

532
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:29,430
Something burning?

533
00:58:29,739 --> 00:58:31,673
Oh, it must be coming from outside.

534
00:58:31,941 --> 00:58:35,172
Neighbours of Achi. Bill.
He just got it.

535
00:58:35,378 --> 00:58:38,939
I still have that one.
-You what?

536
00:58:40,617 --> 00:58:43,108
I have that one too.

537
00:58:51,327 --> 00:58:53,693
I remember that day.

538
00:58:54,430 --> 00:58:56,332
There are dozen people waiting in line...

539
00:58:56,332 --> 00:58:59,267
And you went through
whole broad of corders.

540
00:58:59,502 --> 00:59:01,738
Look at my face,
you could tell it's just...

541
00:59:01,738 --> 00:59:05,230
Terrified that my dad
was going to come in any second.

542
00:59:19,389 --> 00:59:21,789
You're just...

543
00:59:23,960 --> 00:59:27,293
Maybe I should walk you to your car.

544
00:59:29,065 --> 00:59:31,932
This is not a good time.

545
00:59:35,138 --> 00:59:38,207
You almost kill yourself on the highway
so you can ask me out,

546
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:39,742
And then you don't show.

547
00:59:39,742 --> 00:59:41,678
Then keep my picture...

548
00:59:41,678 --> 00:59:43,613
But when I kiss you,
you try to shove me out the door.

549
00:59:43,613 --> 00:59:47,549
What's... what's going on?

550
00:59:47,917 --> 00:59:50,442
Don't you care about me at all, Johnny?

551
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,655
You know you can talk to me.

552
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:55,590
You can tell me anything.

553
00:59:55,925 --> 00:59:58,485
Please.

554
01:00:00,096 --> 01:00:02,997
You wouldn't believe me anyway.

555
01:00:05,168 --> 01:00:08,365
Try me.
-Oh, you'll think I知 crazy.

556
01:00:08,571 --> 01:00:11,541
Maybe I am crazy.
I hope I知 crazy.

557
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:14,704
In my job, I致e seen and heard
just about everything.

558
01:00:14,944 --> 01:00:18,710
So there is nothing you can tell me
that's gonna surprise me.

559
01:00:19,082 --> 01:00:21,073
Off the record?

560
01:00:21,351 --> 01:00:23,444
Yeah.

561
01:00:34,664 --> 01:00:38,031
I sold my soul to devil.

562
01:00:41,704 --> 01:00:43,695
Ahem.

563
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:47,501
You knew I have to spare you.

564
01:00:47,777 --> 01:00:49,579
Spare me from what?
-The devil.

565
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:51,347
On account, I work for him.

566
01:00:51,347 --> 01:00:54,680
That's why I can't make it to dinner.

567
01:00:54,951 --> 01:00:57,453
Because you're working...
For the devil?

568
01:00:57,453 --> 01:00:58,721
Yeah.

569
01:00:58,721 --> 01:01:01,524
I知 his bounty hunter.
It only happens at night.

570
01:01:01,524 --> 01:01:03,259
Like it is right now.

571
01:01:03,259 --> 01:01:07,230
When I知 on around evil,
evil people, evil spirits...

572
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:12,668
I change into...
-What?

573
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:16,036
Just a creepy monster.

574
01:01:16,339 --> 01:01:20,410
But I am learning to,
I知 getting control of it...

575
01:01:20,410 --> 01:01:22,674
Trying to.

576
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:27,341
So tonight? You'll...

577
01:01:28,618 --> 01:01:30,286
I believe so.

578
01:01:30,286 --> 01:01:35,458
Which is why it's probably
a very good idea that you...

579
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:38,052
You run on home now, Roxanne.

580
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,666
You're serious?

581
01:01:46,602 --> 01:01:49,730
So this is... this is your excuse?

582
01:01:49,972 --> 01:01:56,434
For the past? For last night?
For everything? -Uhuh.

583
01:02:02,585 --> 01:02:07,545
Um, lastly that I got a couple
of choices.

584
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:11,961
I can either accept that you really
believe what you're telling me is true,

585
01:02:11,961 --> 01:02:14,395
And take you to the nearest
psychiatric hospital.

586
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:17,256
You see, now there...
-Or...

587
01:02:17,533 --> 01:02:20,236
I realize that you rather make up
ridiculous stories...

588
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:28,507
...than be honest with me.
And I walk out that door, forever.

589
01:02:51,868 --> 01:02:53,392
Don't move.

590
01:02:53,703 --> 01:02:55,037
Stay right there.

591
01:02:55,037 --> 01:02:56,806
Hands over your head.

592
01:02:56,806 --> 01:02:58,535
Johnny Blaze.

593
01:02:59,342 --> 01:03:03,142
Yeah. Captain Jack Dolan.

594
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:05,609
This is Officer Edwards.

595
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:09,111
You're coming with us.

596
01:03:09,485 --> 01:03:10,850
Okay.

597
01:03:15,825 --> 01:03:17,793
Let's try this again.

598
01:03:18,094 --> 01:03:19,962
What about him?
You remember him?

599
01:03:19,962 --> 01:03:23,065
This guy was 3 years from retirement,
you're harm to flame his life.

600
01:03:23,065 --> 01:03:26,202
In fact, neither that most of the corpse
has turn in since you came home,

601
01:03:26,202 --> 01:03:28,102
You son of a bitch.

602
01:03:28,971 --> 01:03:31,303
I didn't kill anybody.
-Bullshit.

603
01:03:31,541 --> 01:03:33,941
Okay. Let's take a breather.

604
01:03:35,545 --> 01:03:37,480
It's warm in here.
-Warm?

605
01:03:37,480 --> 01:03:41,007
Yeah, I知 burning up. Aren't you?
-No.

606
01:03:43,085 --> 01:03:44,916
You want a cigarette?

607
01:03:45,154 --> 01:03:46,644
Okay.

608
01:03:46,923 --> 01:03:49,414
Mind if I do?

609
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,427
I told you that was weird.

610
01:03:57,800 --> 01:03:59,368
Look, Johnny.

611
01:03:59,368 --> 01:04:01,233
I知 not asking for your help.

612
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:05,099
I知 asking you to help yourself.

613
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:08,869

and you provide very very
important super services

616
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:18,588
In fact, when I finish my stunt career

617
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:21,991
I attend to apply my skill to
be a motorcycle policeman

618
