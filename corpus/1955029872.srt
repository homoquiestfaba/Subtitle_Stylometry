1
00:02:35,759 --> 00:02:37,660
I ran the scan
three times.

2
00:02:37,685 --> 00:02:38,735
Recalibrated
the equipment.

3
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:40,938
I keep getting a shadow
under number 11.

4
00:02:42,533 --> 00:02:43,798
Let me see it.

5
00:02:55,207 --> 00:02:57,552
You have a copy
of the old aerial scan?

6
00:03:01,291 --> 00:03:02,825
Put it under it.

7
00:03:07,572 --> 00:03:09,575
Give me de Vaux's plot.

8
00:03:11,645 --> 00:03:13,062
De Vaux went over
this whole site

9
00:03:13,130 --> 00:03:14,419
With a fine tooth comb.

10
00:03:14,444 --> 00:03:17,846
He's dead, but he was here
50 years ago.

11
00:03:18,416 --> 00:03:21,583
You can say he had
a technological disadvantage.

12
00:03:24,591 --> 00:03:25,618
Son of a bitch!

13
00:03:25,643 --> 00:03:26,661
What?

14
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:28,598
This isn't a shadow.

15
00:03:28,757 --> 00:03:30,024
It's isn't?
No.

16
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:33,403
Archaeologists have been
coming here since 1947.

17
00:03:33,428 --> 00:03:36,263
Sukenik, Harding, de Vaux.

18
00:03:37,188 --> 00:03:38,372
They found
the dead sea scrolls

19
00:03:38,397 --> 00:03:39,966
In 13 of these caves.

20
00:03:40,331 --> 00:03:42,465
De Vaux explored another 40.

21
00:03:43,036 --> 00:03:45,662
And all of them missed this.

22
00:03:46,169 --> 00:03:47,661
There's another chamber.

23
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:50,067
It's hidden
under cave 11.

24
00:03:50,583 --> 00:03:52,356
There is?
There is.

25
00:03:52,794 --> 00:03:54,437
I want you to get me
five men with shovels.

26
00:03:54,505 --> 00:03:56,450
Meet me at cave 11.
Got it.

27
00:04:11,603 --> 00:04:13,427
Here's those fragments
you wanted me to catalogue.

28
00:04:13,585 --> 00:04:14,692
Oh, great.

29
00:04:15,707 --> 00:04:16,763
Whew.

30
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:21,106
What's going on?

31
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:26,478
We may have just turned
the last 50 years

32
00:04:26,503 --> 00:04:29,395
Of biblical archeology
on its ears.

33
00:04:31,356 --> 00:04:33,684
You want to go open
an undiscovered cave?

34
00:04:34,763 --> 00:04:35,966
You're kidding, right?

35
00:04:38,395 --> 00:04:39,692
We found it.

36
00:04:40,395 --> 00:04:41,651
Under cave 11.

37
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:43,419
Let's go get
our hands dirty, shall we?

38
00:04:43,487 --> 00:04:44,864
Absolutely!

39
00:05:02,555 --> 00:05:03,395
There!

40
00:05:09,675 --> 00:05:12,052
It's a cover stone.
Find the edges!

41
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:20,331
It's in cuneiform.
Sumerian, maybe?

42
00:05:20,356 --> 00:05:21,520
Yeah, maybe.

43
00:05:22,005 --> 00:05:23,105
It isn't a cave.

44
00:05:23,130 --> 00:05:25,169
No, it's a vault.

45
00:05:27,498 --> 00:05:29,833
Wait, what... hey,
what are you saying?

46
00:05:30,177 --> 00:05:31,552
Must not open.

47
00:05:31,692 --> 00:05:33,138
Death waits below.

48
00:05:33,903 --> 00:05:36,434
Oh, don't be ridiculous.

49
00:05:38,997 --> 00:05:39,919
No, no, no, no!

50
00:05:39,944 --> 00:05:43,130
Hey, hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey!

51
00:05:43,414 --> 00:05:45,715
Death waits below.

52
00:05:46,216 --> 00:05:47,278
Take it easy.

53
00:05:47,985 --> 00:05:49,481
Nobody needs
to get hurt.

54
00:05:50,763 --> 00:05:53,473
We're on a search
for truth, not treasure.

55
00:05:55,092 --> 00:05:58,388
You're foolish
to ignore the word of god.

56
00:06:13,110 --> 00:06:14,404
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

57
00:06:16,318 --> 00:06:17,474
Maybe he's right.

58
00:06:17,779 --> 00:06:18,411
What?

59
00:06:18,892 --> 00:06:20,783
That god would strike me
down If I opened the vault?

60
00:06:20,808 --> 00:06:21,456
Please!

61
00:06:21,645 --> 00:06:24,628
No, no, no.
Not god... Mold.

62
00:06:25,049 --> 00:06:25,784
What?

63
00:06:25,809 --> 00:06:28,143
Well, the seal on this vault
is airtight.

64
00:06:28,385 --> 00:06:32,328
It could contain airborne
pathogens, Bacteria, fungi, spores,

65
00:06:32,353 --> 00:06:34,154
That could very well
kill you.

66
00:06:34,628 --> 00:06:35,898
Remember what happened
to lord Carnarvon

67
00:06:35,966 --> 00:06:37,393
After he opened
Tutankhamen's tomb?

68
00:06:37,418 --> 00:06:40,526
She's exactly right.
I got carried away.

69
00:06:40,643 --> 00:06:42,995
We gotta be careful
about this and do this right. Russell,

70
00:06:43,998 --> 00:06:47,081
go back up and get me some breathers,
and also get my air tester.

71
00:06:49,588 --> 00:06:50,987
You all right?
Yeah.

72
00:06:51,604 --> 00:06:52,557
Good catch.

73
00:06:55,847 --> 00:06:57,081
That's it, Russell.

74
00:07:04,385 --> 00:07:06,662
Okay, lift it on three.
Just a little bit.

75
00:07:06,838 --> 00:07:08,331
One, two, three.

76
00:07:08,399 --> 00:07:09,651
Good.

77
00:07:12,970 --> 00:07:16,163
All clear. No methane. No
toxins beyond normal levels.

78
00:07:16,407 --> 00:07:18,307
All right, let's get
down there!

79
00:07:18,784 --> 00:07:19,776
That's it!

80
00:07:20,182 --> 00:07:21,110
good, come on!

81
00:07:21,178 --> 00:07:22,393
A little bit more!

82
00:07:23,034 --> 00:07:23,679
Good!

83
00:07:23,747 --> 00:07:25,479
Russell, get on
the other side.

84
00:07:28,729 --> 00:07:29,752
On three, push.

85
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:31,479
One, two, three.

86
00:07:33,049 --> 00:07:33,930
Good!

87
00:07:35,239 --> 00:07:37,010
All right, ladder.

88
00:07:52,378 --> 00:07:54,823
Look at these.
What are they for?

89
00:07:54,871 --> 00:07:55,815
I don't know.

90
00:07:55,998 --> 00:07:57,674
Never seen anything like it.

91
00:07:59,076 --> 00:08:00,109
Could they be air vents?

92
00:08:00,349 --> 00:08:02,354
Maybe, but why?

93
00:08:06,216 --> 00:08:07,963
Uh, doc?

94
00:08:08,128 --> 00:08:09,768
Yeah, I see.

95
00:08:10,431 --> 00:08:12,682
Wow.
Oh, my god.

96
00:08:31,823 --> 00:08:33,167
Run!
What?

97
00:08:34,713 --> 00:08:36,057
Run!

98
00:08:38,355 --> 00:08:39,370
Russell!

99
00:08:40,824 --> 00:08:42,191
Unh!

100
00:08:42,259 --> 00:08:44,096
Go, go!

101
00:08:46,932 --> 00:08:48,042
Run!

102
00:08:49,820 --> 00:08:51,888
Russell, come on!
Russell!

103
00:08:58,947 --> 00:09:00,915
Professor!
Nicholas!

104
00:09:03,625 --> 00:09:05,073
Doc!
Nicholas!

105
00:09:05,098 --> 00:09:06,721
Professor!
Nicholas!

106
00:09:08,891 --> 00:09:10,479
Doc!

107
00:09:31,779 --> 00:09:32,755
You think it could be it?

108
00:09:32,780 --> 00:09:34,814
We need to get this back
to the university

109
00:09:35,396 --> 00:09:36,341
So we open the jar there.

110
00:09:36,366 --> 00:09:37,667
Let's just take one little
peek inside.

111
00:09:37,692 --> 00:09:38,365
Just a little look, doc.

112
00:09:38,390 --> 00:09:39,350
Not until we're in

113
00:09:39,375 --> 00:09:41,460
An environmentally
controlled... Room.

114
00:09:45,222 --> 00:09:46,569
Not until then.

115
00:09:48,827 --> 00:09:51,006
You need to book us
on a flight out of here.

116
00:09:54,512 --> 00:09:56,741
All right, but why do I
always have to do

117
00:09:56,799 --> 00:09:58,616
All the booking
of the flights,

118
00:09:58,641 --> 00:10:00,147
The lugging of equipment?</i>

119
00:10:00,332 --> 00:10:02,475
All the grunt work,
and you Joanna don't?

120
00:10:03,897 --> 00:10:04,702
Seniority.

121
00:10:05,241 --> 00:10:05,983
Tenure.

122
00:10:07,368 --> 00:10:08,735
All right, I'm on it.

123
00:10:12,397 --> 00:10:14,006
All right,
I'll help him out.

124
00:10:24,127 --> 00:10:26,264
Russell, entire
academic careers

125
00:10:26,289 --> 00:10:28,295
Have been made
out of discoveries like this.

126
00:10:28,655 --> 00:10:30,217
Still, doc, I don't know
if this is a good idea.

127
00:10:30,368 --> 00:10:31,428
You should
face the facts.

128
00:10:31,461 --> 00:10:34,503
The fact is she's the best
archaeolinguist on the planet.

129
00:10:34,528 --> 00:10:36,474
You could get Hoffmann
at Braxton University

130
00:10:36,499 --> 00:10:37,773
Or Dr. Lillis
at Whittendale.

131
00:10:37,798 --> 00:10:38,881
They could help us out.

132
00:10:38,906 --> 00:10:40,663
Yes, but she is the best.

133
00:10:40,819 --> 00:10:42,608
She's also your ex-wife.

134
00:10:43,850 --> 00:10:44,460
So?

135
00:10:44,858 --> 00:10:46,816
Doc, this is you
we're talking about.

136
00:10:46,841 --> 00:10:48,835
You know, you and her,
oil and water?

137
00:10:48,936 --> 00:10:50,756
Alcohol and public nudity?

138
00:10:50,944 --> 00:10:53,038
Some things just don't mix!

139
00:11:00,006 --> 00:11:02,098
Look, doc, I don't know
what happened between you two,

140
00:11:02,165 --> 00:11:03,232
And it's none
of my business,

141
00:11:03,307 --> 00:11:04,543
But every time
someone mentions her name

142
00:11:04,568 --> 00:11:05,778
you get all dark
and irritable.

143
00:11:05,803 --> 00:11:08,237
Then you usually find Two days'
worth of paperwork to dump on me.

144
00:11:08,429 --> 00:11:09,562
It'd be two hours
if you could type.

145
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:10,444
There you go!

146
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:13,095
You haven't even seen her yet and you're
already attacking my academic credentials.

147
00:11:13,311 --> 00:11:14,131
Give me that.

148
00:11:15,345 --> 00:11:18,592
I wasn't attacking
your academic credentials.

149
00:11:18,874 --> 00:11:21,616
I was just pondering
your lack of posable thumbs.

150
00:11:21,649 --> 00:11:23,702
Right there!
You did it again.

151
00:11:24,221 --> 00:11:25,561
Not nice, doc!

152
00:11:26,089 --> 00:11:27,311
Not nice.

153
00:11:35,855 --> 00:11:37,689
I bet that's a page-turner.

154
00:11:41,412 --> 00:11:42,616
Nicholas.

155
00:11:43,335 --> 00:11:44,530
Hello, Ava.

156
00:11:46,019 --> 00:11:47,019
What do you want?

157
00:11:49,367 --> 00:11:50,163
Your help.

158
00:11:51,046 --> 00:11:53,100
I never thought
I'd hear you say that again.

159
00:11:58,405 --> 00:11:59,491
It's important.

160
00:12:00,902 --> 00:12:02,905
I don't know who else
to trust with this.

161
00:12:07,342 --> 00:12:09,506
I don't know.
It's been a long time.

162
00:12:10,397 --> 00:12:12,134
Yes, it has.

163
00:12:12,420 --> 00:12:14,592
Doesn't make it
any easier, does it?

164
00:12:15,631 --> 00:12:17,288
No, it certainly doesn't.

165
00:12:18,889 --> 00:12:21,225
I'm glad to see you, Nicholas.
Really.

166
00:12:21,827 --> 00:12:23,006
You look good.

167
00:12:24,327 --> 00:12:25,413
I hope you're happy.

168
00:12:26,416 --> 00:12:27,647
But I don't want
to do this anymore,

169
00:12:27,672 --> 00:12:29,239
So please leave.

170
00:12:32,194 --> 00:12:35,085
Ava, I think I just found
the last dead sea scroll.

171
00:12:35,647 --> 00:12:37,491
You what? How?

172
00:12:37,631 --> 00:12:38,616
Qumran.

173
00:12:38,977 --> 00:12:42,975
I found an undiscovered
man made vault under cave 11.

174
00:12:43,038 --> 00:12:44,428
Was there
a clay jar in it?

175
00:12:44,460 --> 00:12:45,510
Yes!

176
00:12:45,535 --> 00:12:46,769
Did you open it?

177
00:12:46,837 --> 00:12:48,975
No.
The lid is sealed.

178
00:12:50,975 --> 00:12:53,819
All right, but we do it
my way, no debates.

179
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:57,060
Fine, but I have to have
my graduate students with me.

180
00:12:57,085 --> 00:12:59,116
They helped me find it.
Agreed.

181
00:12:59,256 --> 00:12:59,913
Great.

182
00:13:00,519 --> 00:13:02,913
So see you in an hour?

183
00:13:03,710 --> 00:13:05,780
All right, fine.

184
00:13:06,514 --> 00:13:07,499
Thank you.

185
00:13:16,262 --> 00:13:17,843
All right,
I'll meet you inside.

186
00:13:17,868 --> 00:13:19,545
Dr. Greenaway is
waiting on us.

187
00:13:23,741 --> 00:13:26,311
So what's the deal between
him and Greenaway anyhow?

188
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:28,591
I'm surprised
he's even talking to her.

189
00:13:28,616 --> 00:13:29,397
What happened?

190
00:13:29,522 --> 00:13:31,803
I'm not really sure
of all the details, but...

191
00:13:32,452 --> 00:13:33,482
about five years ago

192
00:13:33,550 --> 00:13:34,784
One of Nicholas'
grad students

193
00:13:34,851 --> 00:13:36,608
accused him
of sexual harassment.

194
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:37,987
Yeah.

195
00:13:38,097 --> 00:13:40,163
It got ugly. She said
that they had an affair,

196
00:13:40,188 --> 00:13:42,267
and after she broke it off,
he harassed her.

197
00:13:42,335 --> 00:13:44,616
Dr. Greenaway found out about
the affair and dumped him?

198
00:13:44,641 --> 00:13:46,897
Well, that's just the thing.
There never was an affair.

199
00:13:46,922 --> 00:13:48,774
Turned out that
she had some mental problems

200
00:13:48,799 --> 00:13:50,666
and was just
obsessed with him.

201
00:13:50,866 --> 00:13:53,085
I mean, he was eventually
cleared of any wrongdoing, but...

202
00:13:53,350 --> 00:13:55,006
it was after a pretty
lengthy investigation.

203
00:13:55,031 --> 00:13:56,452
So why did they break up?

204
00:13:56,791 --> 00:13:58,707
I don't know. I guess Dr.
Greenaway didn't believe in him

205
00:13:58,732 --> 00:14:00,717
and that's when things
got broken between them.

206
00:14:00,742 --> 00:14:02,694
Come on, I don't want to miss
the opening of the jar.

207
00:14:03,795 --> 00:14:05,710
Dr. Greenaway,
these are my assistants,

208
00:14:05,735 --> 00:14:06,780
Joanna and Russell.

209
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:07,858
Nice to meet you.

210
00:14:08,686 --> 00:14:09,647
Joanna.

211
00:14:31,327 --> 00:14:32,444
It's extraordinary.

212
00:14:34,713 --> 00:14:36,795
The seal is cracked,
but it's intact.

213
00:14:38,382 --> 00:14:40,733
We had a little trouble
getting it out of the chamber.

214
00:14:40,843 --> 00:14:42,355
Yeah, like nearly dying.

215
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:44,381
Oh, he exaggerates.

216
00:14:44,999 --> 00:14:46,936
Do you want to open it
or shall I?

217
00:14:47,842 --> 00:14:49,491
you always had
the steadier hands.

218
00:14:49,960 --> 00:14:51,194
I thought you forgot.

219
00:14:58,366 --> 00:14:59,092
Okay.

220
00:15:02,241 --> 00:15:03,241
Gentle.

221
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,225
Aidan, take this
to Caitlin for dating.

222
00:15:09,866 --> 00:15:10,936
Thank you.

223
00:15:12,540 --> 00:15:14,108
Let's see
what we have here.

224
00:15:17,402 --> 00:15:19,870
Dear god,
they are amazing.

225
00:15:20,608 --> 00:15:23,022
The most well-preserved
papyrus I've ever seen.

226
00:15:23,288 --> 00:15:24,381
Are they decipherable?

227
00:15:24,406 --> 00:15:27,005
This is different than anything
I've ever encountered before.

228
00:15:27,201 --> 00:15:29,858
Look, the structure,

229
00:15:29,967 --> 00:15:32,741
the syntax, it's unlike the other
scrolls discovered at Qumran.

230
00:15:32,766 --> 00:15:34,850
But you can translate them,
though, right?

231
00:15:35,334 --> 00:15:36,694
It's going to take time.

232
00:15:36,719 --> 00:15:38,286
There's a lot
of information here.

233
00:15:38,866 --> 00:15:40,881
There are a battery of tests
I want to run.

234
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:42,371
I'll put
my entire team on it.

235
00:15:42,469 --> 00:15:44,233
Give me three weeks.
But...

236
00:15:44,599 --> 00:15:46,066
Nicholas, let me
do my work.

237
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:49,985
All right.

238
00:15:50,475 --> 00:15:51,186
All right, fine.

239
00:15:52,085 --> 00:15:53,217
I'll see you then.

240
00:15:54,358 --> 00:15:55,891
Caitlin, come here.
Come see.

241
00:15:55,959 --> 00:15:56,959
Aidan, come here.

242
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,249
So what'd you find?

243
00:16:45,491 --> 00:16:46,639
Nicholas.

244
00:16:47,655 --> 00:16:49,833
I only managed to decipher
half the documents,

245
00:16:49,858 --> 00:16:51,092
And that wasn't easy.

246
00:16:51,396 --> 00:16:53,710
There's more to this than you
can see on the surface.

247
00:16:53,858 --> 00:16:55,327
A palimpsest.
Yes.

248
00:16:55,710 --> 00:16:56,483
What?

249
00:16:56,508 --> 00:16:59,077
A palimpsest is parchment,
sometimes vellum.

250
00:16:59,116 --> 00:17:02,656
It's written on, then the ink
is washed away and it's reused.

251
00:17:02,866 --> 00:17:05,756
Only the surface text is visible To
the naked eye,

252
00:17:05,781 --> 00:17:07,694
but there are secrets hat lie beneath.

253
00:17:08,210 --> 00:17:09,483
So what is it?

254
00:17:09,944 --> 00:17:11,710
It's the book of <i>Genesis. </i>

255
00:17:16,881 --> 00:17:17,514
My god.

256
00:17:17,539 --> 00:17:20,928
Carbon dating says it was
written around 380 B. C.

257
00:17:21,155 --> 00:17:25,600
While the exodus scrolls are somewhere
between 98 BC. and 13 AD.

258
00:17:25,625 --> 00:17:26,572
Yes. 

259
00:17:26,890 --> 00:17:28,856
And you just said this is
the book of Genesis.

260
00:17:28,881 --> 00:17:30,146
As in <i>the</i> Book.

261
00:17:30,171 --> 00:17:31,748
The unabridged edition.

262
00:17:31,773 --> 00:17:34,354
There are things in here
that are not in any translation

263
00:17:34,379 --> 00:17:35,757
of the old testament.

264
00:17:37,039 --> 00:17:39,781
This is the oldest biblical
document ever discovered.

265
00:17:40,398 --> 00:17:41,468
Cool!

266
00:17:42,015 --> 00:17:43,030
There is still work
to be done,

267
00:17:43,097 --> 00:17:45,098
but if it bears out,
this could be one of

268
00:17:45,166 --> 00:17:47,851
the most significant discoveries
in the history of mankind.

269
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:50,718
Well, the dead sea scroll
was pretty significant.

270
00:17:50,866 --> 00:17:52,358
Why is this one
so special?

271
00:17:52,788 --> 00:17:54,412
According
to these scrolls,

272
00:17:54,437 --> 00:17:56,780
Noah was sent on more
than one mission from god.

273
00:17:57,007 --> 00:17:59,162
It says early
in the time of man,

274
00:17:59,187 --> 00:18:02,046
giants, creatures,
and demons roamed the earth.

275
00:18:02,335 --> 00:18:04,084
They were called
the Nephilim.

276
00:18:04,515 --> 00:18:06,241
God banished all
these evil beings,

277
00:18:06,266 --> 00:18:09,218
for he thought their wickedness
was corrupting mankind.

278
00:18:09,524 --> 00:18:11,640
All of them were gone
except one.

279
00:18:12,683 --> 00:18:14,866
It was created by the darkness
to do its bidding.

280
00:18:15,296 --> 00:18:18,210
Tormented and tortured,
the darkness took pleasure

281
00:18:18,235 --> 00:18:19,654
in the creature's pain.

282
00:18:20,733 --> 00:18:21,897
The darkness?

283
00:18:22,140 --> 00:18:23,897
It's a reference
to an evil being.

284
00:18:24,163 --> 00:18:25,319
The devil, perhaps.

285
00:18:25,616 --> 00:18:26,540
It's metaphorical.

286
00:18:26,765 --> 00:18:28,037
The devil didn't exist.

287
00:18:28,062 --> 00:18:29,788
Some religions don't
recognize the devil.

288
00:18:30,062 --> 00:18:32,999
And some do. It's not metaphorical.
It's a matter of faith.

289
00:18:33,024 --> 00:18:34,882
Right, fine.
Faith it is.

290
00:18:34,944 --> 00:18:35,632
Go on.

291
00:18:37,142 --> 00:18:40,045
The creature was to roam the
earth killing the faithful,

292
00:18:40,213 --> 00:18:42,281
until god summoned
a righteous man, Noah.

293
00:18:43,944 --> 00:18:47,226
God to spoke to Noah and ordered
him to build a mighty ship

294
00:18:47,251 --> 00:18:48,643
to banish the darkness.

295
00:18:49,327 --> 00:18:51,341
So you're saying there was
more than one ark?

296
00:18:51,366 --> 00:18:52,210
Yes.

297
00:18:52,268 --> 00:18:54,741
The first ark was
Noah's test by god.

298
00:18:55,037 --> 00:18:56,365
Well, I guess
he passed.

299
00:18:56,390 --> 00:18:57,544
Actually, he didn't.

300
00:18:58,433 --> 00:19:02,227
Noah captured the creature and set
sail for the far ends of the earth,

301
00:19:02,360 --> 00:19:03,961
to banish it.

302
00:19:04,513 --> 00:19:08,928
For if left unchecked, it was determined
to annihilate all of mankind.

303
00:19:09,981 --> 00:19:11,286
Get out of town!

304
00:19:11,508 --> 00:19:13,794
So Noah built
a monster ark?

305
00:19:13,981 --> 00:19:16,208
I suppose
you could call it that.

306
00:19:17,442 --> 00:19:20,817
It says the powers of evil were
fighting with god over the ship.

307
00:19:21,101 --> 00:19:23,927
They did not want the last
of their breed banished.

308
00:19:23,952 --> 00:19:26,559
Lightning struck the ship
and it began to burn.

309
00:19:26,584 --> 00:19:29,536
And as it burned,
a spear rose from the depths

310
00:19:29,561 --> 00:19:31,223
and cleaved the ark in two.

311
00:19:50,469 --> 00:19:52,747
I managed to decode the next
part of the palimpsest.

312
00:19:52,912 --> 00:19:54,833
It appears to be
coordinates of a map.

313
00:19:55,365 --> 00:19:56,832
It's in the middle
of Iraq.

314
00:19:56,970 --> 00:19:59,248
It'd be impossible
to explore that right now.

315
00:19:59,362 --> 00:20:01,036
Not necessarily.

316
00:20:01,317 --> 00:20:04,213
Doc, you don't plan
on going into Iraq, do you?

317
00:20:04,238 --> 00:20:06,575
Don't worry. I wouldn't
expect you to come with me.

318
00:20:07,067 --> 00:20:08,083
I'll go.

319
00:20:08,457 --> 00:20:09,941
I appreciate that,

320
00:20:09,966 --> 00:20:12,543
but I don't know If
anyone is going just yet.

321
00:20:12,568 --> 00:20:13,667
I'll have to talk
to someone.

322
00:20:13,692 --> 00:20:16,484
Oh, I'm sure she'd love to
follow you there, professor.

323
00:20:19,848 --> 00:20:21,419
Yeah, um,

324
00:20:22,083 --> 00:20:22,951
I gotta go.

325
00:20:23,198 --> 00:20:24,497
Me too.

326
00:20:29,192 --> 00:20:31,153
You can't just leave things
alone, can you?

327
00:20:31,450 --> 00:20:33,691
Me?
I'm fine.

328
00:20:33,716 --> 00:20:35,544
I'm just amazed that
you continue to play games

329
00:20:35,569 --> 00:20:37,536
with your career
and your reputation.

330
00:20:37,561 --> 00:20:39,169
She's my student, Ava.
That's all.

331
00:20:39,536 --> 00:20:40,831
I've heard that before.

332
00:20:40,856 --> 00:20:41,622
That's right.

333
00:20:41,677 --> 00:20:42,809
You heard the truth.

334
00:20:42,834 --> 00:20:45,075
And you were the one
who chose to ignore it.

335
00:20:45,184 --> 00:20:46,580
What did you
want me to think?

336
00:20:46,647 --> 00:20:47,924
No, really, what did
you want me to do?

337
00:20:47,949 --> 00:20:50,684
Just walk around campus
and be the oblivious wife?

338
00:20:50,840 --> 00:20:52,481
Not me, nick!
Not anymore!

339
00:20:52,522 --> 00:20:53,661
I loved you.

340
00:20:54,138 --> 00:20:55,739
I was faithful to you.

341
00:20:55,880 --> 00:20:56,756
I trusted you.

342
00:20:56,824 --> 00:20:59,902
I am sorry that you were
too blind to see that.

343
00:20:59,927 --> 00:21:00,903
I'm sorry.

344
00:21:01,341 --> 00:21:02,762
I have faith
in something else now.

345
00:21:02,787 --> 00:21:05,708
Oh, your faith... your faith,
your righteousness.

346
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:07,310
You're always right,
aren't you?

347
00:21:07,335 --> 00:21:08,678
Don't go there.
Please, don't go there.

348
00:21:08,703 --> 00:21:12,281
Hell, you have more faith
in a biblical fairytale

349
00:21:12,306 --> 00:21:13,883
than you ever did
in your own husband

350
00:21:13,908 --> 00:21:15,419
who was right
in front of you.

351
00:21:15,444 --> 00:21:18,378
Don't you mock my beliefs...
No, you're a scientist, Ava!

352
00:21:18,403 --> 00:21:19,964
You should act like one!
That's right!

353
00:21:19,989 --> 00:21:22,347
You just love to push
the buttons, don't you?

354
00:21:22,372 --> 00:21:24,193
But if you can't
touch it, or see it,

355
00:21:24,218 --> 00:21:26,214
or have some rational
explanation for it

356
00:21:26,239 --> 00:21:27,270
then you don't want
to hear about it.

357
00:21:27,295 --> 00:21:29,177
I think I made a mistake
by coming here.

358
00:21:29,202 --> 00:21:30,236
So do I.

359
00:21:38,344 --> 00:21:39,247
Damn it.

360
00:21:41,972 --> 00:21:43,005
And that's
really the basis

361
00:21:43,030 --> 00:21:44,564
behind the classification
scheme.

362
00:21:45,964 --> 00:21:46,942
Excuse me.

363
00:21:52,552 --> 00:21:53,872
Hi.
What are you doing here?

364
00:21:53,897 --> 00:21:55,225
I want to talk to you.

365
00:21:55,521 --> 00:21:57,442
Uh, I'm a little
busy right now.

366
00:21:57,778 --> 00:21:59,153
It's important.

367
00:21:59,505 --> 00:22:01,528
Oh, okay, yeah,
join the meeting.

368
00:22:04,216 --> 00:22:06,122
This is Dr. Ava Greenaway.

369
00:22:06,147 --> 00:22:08,904
Dr. Greenaway,
this is Mr. Fasanella

370
00:22:09,145 --> 00:22:11,042
from Federal Tactical
Intelligence.

371
00:22:11,145 --> 00:22:12,583
What is it
that you do?

372
00:22:12,708 --> 00:22:14,872
We do satellite mapping
and imagery,

373
00:22:14,897 --> 00:22:16,031
among other things.

374
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:17,614
I see.

375
00:22:18,094 --> 00:22:20,386
I made an inquiry
to the defense department

376
00:22:20,411 --> 00:22:22,871
about the coordinates that
we found on the palimpsest.

377
00:22:23,058 --> 00:22:24,525
Apparently,
it raised some flags.

378
00:22:24,820 --> 00:22:26,481
Earlier this month
we launched a satellite

379
00:22:26,506 --> 00:22:28,058
that was tasked
with monitoring

380
00:22:28,083 --> 00:22:30,005
The Sunni triangle
for insurgent activity.

381
00:22:30,149 --> 00:22:31,337
Almost as soon
as the bird went up,

382
00:22:31,362 --> 00:22:32,348
it began
sending us readings

383
00:22:32,373 --> 00:22:34,544
That indicated
an energy anomaly.

384
00:22:34,569 --> 00:22:36,598
In the area we want 
to have an expedition...

385
00:22:36,623 --> 00:22:38,238
Is within the quadrant
registering the anomaly.

386
00:22:38,263 --> 00:22:39,591
What do you think it is?

387
00:22:39,763 --> 00:22:41,083
We don't know for sure.

388
00:22:41,239 --> 00:22:43,473
Communication in the area
is spotty at best.

389
00:22:43,740 --> 00:22:46,052
The troops have a very difficult
time Operating there,

390
00:22:46,077 --> 00:22:48,505
and the insurgents know that
and take full advantage of it.

391
00:22:48,806 --> 00:22:50,540
It could be a weapons cache,

392
00:22:50,748 --> 00:22:53,039
or a secret bomb making
facility, or worse.

393
00:22:53,209 --> 00:22:54,817
Weapons of
mass destruction.

394
00:22:54,842 --> 00:22:56,008

Possibly.

395
00:22:56,040 --> 00:22:58,409
We'll be sending a small strike team
to the area to investigate, but

396
00:22:58,610 --> 00:23:00,954
we thought with your particular
expertise in archeology,

397
00:23:00,979 --> 00:23:03,008
it might be mutually
beneficial to bring you along.

398
00:23:03,033 --> 00:23:04,883
You might spot something
our boys don't.

399
00:23:05,047 --> 00:23:06,261
I'm going with him.

400
00:23:06,286 --> 00:23:06,922
No, you're not.

401
00:23:06,947 --> 00:23:08,625
It's gonna be
very dangerous at best.

402
00:23:08,821 --> 00:23:10,954
I'm the only one who can
decipher the documents.

403
00:23:11,070 --> 00:23:12,668
I haven't even finished
with them yet.

404
00:23:12,875 --> 00:23:14,735
I'll provide more information
for you when we go.

405
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,275
I said no,
and that's final.

406
00:23:16,373 --> 00:23:18,477
I don't remember asking
for your permission, Nicholas.

407
00:23:18,555 --> 00:23:19,829
Who should you start now?

408
00:23:19,867 --> 00:23:21,571
Why don't you stop
with the sarcasm?

409
00:23:21,596 --> 00:23:23,141
Sarcasm? Me?
Oh, that is rich.

410
00:23:23,180 --> 00:23:24,377
Excuse me, Doctor.

411
00:23:24,905 --> 00:23:25,941
Put your team together.

412
00:23:25,966 --> 00:23:27,933
You'll be meeting up with the
transport in the morning.

413
00:23:37,868 --> 00:23:39,620
I don't want
to be responsible

414
00:23:39,645 --> 00:23:41,074
if anything were
to happen to you.

415
00:23:41,370 --> 00:23:43,206
You don't have to be
responsible for me.

416
00:23:43,261 --> 00:23:44,808
I can take care
of myself.

417
00:23:47,190 --> 00:23:47,877
Look...

418
00:23:48,469 --> 00:23:49,714
I have to do this.

419
00:23:50,337 --> 00:23:51,769
I believe in it.

420
00:23:52,946 --> 00:23:54,159
Just trust me.

421
00:23:54,822 --> 00:23:55,941
Please.

422
00:23:59,307 --> 00:24:01,316
This is crazy. 
You know that.

423
00:24:02,290 --> 00:24:04,222
We should wait
until the war is over,

424
00:24:04,472 --> 00:24:05,292
When it's safe.

425
00:24:05,317 --> 00:24:09,222
No, anything that is out there can
be looted or destroyed by then.

426
00:24:10,058 --> 00:24:13,112
No, we are gonna do this now,
not in five years' time.

427
00:24:16,490 --> 00:24:17,495
Nicholas.

428
00:24:19,555 --> 00:24:20,464
All right.

429
00:24:42,589 --> 00:24:43,737
Joanna, right?

430
00:24:45,198 --> 00:24:45,870
Yeah.

431
00:24:47,262 --> 00:24:48,662
I just want to apologize

432
00:24:48,687 --> 00:24:50,167
for my comment
the other day in the lab.

433
00:24:50,192 --> 00:24:51,417
That was uncalled for.

434
00:24:52,148 --> 00:24:53,882
Yeah, it was.

435
00:24:54,542 --> 00:24:56,948
Okay, well, I just
want to apologize.

436
00:24:57,529 --> 00:24:58,830
Apology noted.

437
00:25:02,435 --> 00:25:04,300
You don't like me
very much, do you?

438
00:25:05,712 --> 00:25:07,120
No, that's not true.

439
00:25:07,754 --> 00:25:10,284
I just really care
about this expedition, and...

440
00:25:10,512 --> 00:25:12,440
well, I'm concerned
about you coming along.

441
00:25:13,182 --> 00:25:14,823
You think
that I'm a problem?

442
00:25:16,097 --> 00:25:19,307
Well, where we're going is not
exactly a walk in the park, and...

443
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:22,284
I just think that everyone
should be in top form.

444
00:25:22,948 --> 00:25:24,362
No distractions.

445
00:25:24,670 --> 00:25:26,571
You think
I'm a distraction.

446
00:25:26,940 --> 00:25:28,198
I'm sorry.

447
00:25:28,508 --> 00:25:30,075
Maybe it's not
my place.

448
00:25:30,792 --> 00:25:32,878
Joanna, I am going,

449
00:25:32,903 --> 00:25:35,370
and you and I are going
to have to work together.

450
00:25:40,321 --> 00:25:41,503
Okay.

451
00:25:50,417 --> 00:25:51,886
If anyone wants
to back out now,

452
00:25:51,911 --> 00:25:53,675
I wouldn't think
any less of you.

453
00:25:54,133 --> 00:25:56,995
We're going to the most
dangerous place on the planet.

454
00:25:57,333 --> 00:26:00,259
And there's a real possibility
Of getting hurt or worse.

455
00:26:00,628 --> 00:26:01,722
Forget it, Doc.

456
00:26:01,866 --> 00:26:03,987
It's Noah's Ark
we're talking about here.

457
00:26:04,654 --> 00:26:06,573
As they say
in Texas hold 'em,

458
00:26:06,598 --> 00:26:07,628
we're all in.

459
00:26:08,491 --> 00:26:09,378
All right, then.

460
00:26:10,004 --> 00:26:13,464
First stop is Dover, then we
catch a transit plane to Iraq.

461
00:26:14,722 --> 00:26:16,206
I'm driving.

462
00:26:16,231 --> 00:26:18,237
What? H-how come
you always drive?

463
00:26:18,262 --> 00:26:20,636
Because you can't.
Yes, I can.

464
00:26:20,731 --> 00:26:23,099
What he does cannot
be considered driving.

465
00:26:23,186 --> 00:26:24,682
Oh, he knows you well.

466
00:26:25,526 --> 00:26:26,198
I...

467
00:26:26,238 --> 00:26:28,807
Oh, great, now you're
all ganging up on me.

468
00:26:29,006 --> 00:26:30,073
What...

469
00:26:51,508 --> 00:26:52,589
So if we find this ark,

470
00:26:52,614 --> 00:26:54,917
are you still gonna think
the bible is fiction?

471
00:26:56,017 --> 00:26:59,503
Whatever we find will be
an archaeological artifact.

472
00:26:59,894 --> 00:27:02,770
I'm interested in proving
historical realities,

473
00:27:02,795 --> 00:27:04,863
not perpetuating
biblical stories.

474
00:27:05,099 --> 00:27:06,901
I'm not going
on a crusade here,

475
00:27:06,926 --> 00:27:09,253
And I don't know
the frequent flyer miles.

476
00:27:09,466 --> 00:27:11,133
You're amazing.
What?

477
00:27:11,474 --> 00:27:14,042
We're about to discover The
first ark that Noah built,

478
00:27:14,067 --> 00:27:15,901
And yet you refuse
to believe.

479
00:27:15,973 --> 00:27:17,120
In what religion?

480
00:27:17,653 --> 00:27:20,120
What about God,
Jesus Christ,

481
00:27:20,145 --> 00:27:22,393
Mohammad,
Buddha, Vishnu?

482
00:27:22,418 --> 00:27:23,585
No, there are
plenty of people

483
00:27:23,610 --> 00:27:25,425
who believe
in those things

484
00:27:25,602 --> 00:27:28,354
And have done horrible things
to their fellow man

485
00:27:28,379 --> 00:27:29,646
in the name
of their religion.

486
00:27:29,928 --> 00:27:32,089
Yes, but you cannot
let what men do

487
00:27:32,114 --> 00:27:34,182
affect your belief
in a higher power.

488
00:27:34,207 --> 00:27:35,222
I've never felt the need

489
00:27:35,247 --> 00:27:36,448
to have something
in the universe

490
00:27:36,473 --> 00:27:37,940
to intercede
in my life.

491
00:27:38,084 --> 00:27:39,690
I am in control
of my life.

492
00:27:39,884 --> 00:27:42,065
And if people
took responsibility

493
00:27:42,224 --> 00:27:43,245
for their actions,

494
00:27:43,581 --> 00:27:44,940
The world would be
a better place.

495
00:27:44,965 --> 00:27:46,550
But I would hate
to live like you do.

496
00:27:46,642 --> 00:27:49,378
You know, just living like
there's nothing out there.

497
00:27:49,548 --> 00:27:51,565
That we die and we get
buried in the earth

498
00:27:51,598 --> 00:27:54,097
for a future archaeologist
to dig up.

499
00:27:55,262 --> 00:27:56,354
I sometimes envy you.

500
00:27:56,379 --> 00:27:56,854
I...

501
00:27:57,626 --> 00:28:00,354
I think it would be easier to
live life with those blinders on,

502
00:28:00,379 --> 00:28:01,893
But I can't do it.

503
00:28:02,392 --> 00:28:03,526
I can't.

504
00:28:06,375 --> 00:28:08,636
This scroll you found,
the fact that it was buried

505
00:28:08,661 --> 00:28:10,222
In a vault beneath a cave...

506
00:28:10,247 --> 00:28:11,981
You think that somebody
didn't want them found.

507
00:28:12,148 --> 00:28:13,018
Yes.

508
00:28:13,211 --> 00:28:14,620
Yeah, that's
a pretty safe bet.

509
00:28:14,709 --> 00:28:16,843
You know the legend
surrounding the scrolls.

510
00:28:16,868 --> 00:28:19,011
The secret brotherhood
sworn to protect them.

511
00:28:19,059 --> 00:28:21,427
That possibility
doesn't concern you?

512
00:28:22,151 --> 00:28:23,737
That doesn't worry me.

513
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,198
It's all fiction
for the faithful.

514
00:28:27,733 --> 00:28:30,502
That is definitely one
of the reasons why we broke up.

515
00:28:30,662 --> 00:28:33,197
You have no faith in anything
unless you can see it.

516
00:28:33,437 --> 00:28:35,104
The reason we broke up

517
00:28:35,628 --> 00:28:38,628
Is because you
had no faith in me.

518
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:06,870
This is Cain.

519
00:29:08,553 --> 00:29:09,870
Hello?
Hello!

520
00:29:11,193 --> 00:29:12,293
It has been found.

521
00:29:14,550 --> 00:29:17,185
We must alert the brotherhood
before it's too late.

522
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:48,550
Nicholas Zavatterro.

523
00:29:48,575 --> 00:29:50,948
Major gentry.
Welcome to the sandbox.

524
00:29:50,973 --> 00:29:53,214
Thanks. 
We'll talk in my command center.

525
00:29:53,693 --> 00:29:54,826
Come on!

526
00:29:58,864 --> 00:30:01,810
The search area is
ten kilometers square.

527
00:30:01,835 --> 00:30:04,154
We're using a low-profile
tack team.

528
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:05,818
I don't know
about this, major.

529
00:30:05,843 --> 00:30:07,740
Aren't there an awful lot
of insurgents out there?

530
00:30:07,765 --> 00:30:09,474
We're gonna look
just like any other patrol.

531
00:30:09,631 --> 00:30:11,951
Not something for them
to target with their forces.

532
00:30:12,021 --> 00:30:13,669
The only thing we need
to worry about

533
00:30:13,694 --> 00:30:15,286
Is the roadside bombs.

534
00:30:16,450 --> 00:30:17,974
Oh, that makes me
feel better.

535
00:30:17,999 --> 00:30:20,267
We're going
to a communication dead zone.

536
00:30:20,539 --> 00:30:23,396
The sat phone will be
spotty at best.

537
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:24,380
Excuse me.

538
00:30:24,405 --> 00:30:25,849
May I state
the obvious here.

539
00:30:26,018 --> 00:30:28,052
I think we need
a full unit to go in there.

540
00:30:28,077 --> 00:30:30,661
Ma'am, with all
due respect,

541
00:30:31,009 --> 00:30:32,958
I don't tell you
what rock to dig up.

542
00:30:33,133 --> 00:30:35,841
I appreciate you not telling me
How to run no damn operation.

543
00:30:36,503 --> 00:30:37,904
Get your gear together.

544
00:30:38,119 --> 00:30:39,341
We leave in one hour.

545
00:30:48,583 --> 00:30:49,717
All right, listen up,
you guys.

546
00:30:49,742 --> 00:30:51,849
I didn't expect it
to be this hairy.

547
00:30:52,683 --> 00:30:55,013
Maybe I should be
the only one to go out there

548
00:30:55,291 --> 00:30:56,458
For safety reasons.

549
00:30:57,272 --> 00:30:58,724
We're all here now.

550
00:30:59,654 --> 00:31:00,755
Might as well go.

551
00:31:00,845 --> 00:31:02,716
We all knew the risks
when we signed up.

552
00:31:03,216 --> 00:31:04,716
Besides, I don't know
about you,

553
00:31:04,741 --> 00:31:06,141
but I'm not gonna
sit around here

554
00:31:06,166 --> 00:31:07,474
while you go out there
and discover

555
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:09,270
the most important
archaeological find

556
00:31:09,295 --> 00:31:10,888
in the history
of mankind.

557
00:31:12,558 --> 00:31:14,526
All right, let's go.

558
00:31:48,598 --> 00:31:49,497
You getting out?

559
00:31:49,618 --> 00:31:51,180
I got out the last six times.

560
00:31:51,205 --> 00:31:53,029
I think I'll sit
this one out.

561
00:31:57,797 --> 00:31:58,232
I don't know.

562
00:31:58,257 --> 00:32:00,044
You think we got
the coordinates wrong?

563
00:32:02,869 --> 00:32:05,310
One more hour, then we set up
camp for the night.

564
00:32:06,381 --> 00:32:07,865
We need more time, Major.

565
00:32:08,566 --> 00:32:09,943
You don't have more time.

566
00:32:10,981 --> 00:32:12,919
I'm trying to do my job,

567
00:32:13,302 --> 00:32:15,277
And you're making this
more and more difficult.

568
00:32:15,302 --> 00:32:18,888
I suggest you find this damn
thing in the next hour.

569
00:32:22,503 --> 00:32:23,340
Nicholas,

570
00:32:24,426 --> 00:32:25,896
it says "a great spear

571
00:32:26,092 --> 00:32:28,747
rose up from the sea
and cleaved the ark in two. "

572
00:32:31,218 --> 00:32:32,021
There.

573
00:32:35,969 --> 00:32:37,654
And there.
That could be it.

574
00:32:38,225 --> 00:32:39,122
A bump?

575
00:32:40,967 --> 00:32:43,474
After 5,000 years,
you'd be worn down too.

576
00:32:45,257 --> 00:32:46,524
Number seven.

577
00:32:47,052 --> 00:32:48,122
Lucky seven.

578
00:33:00,613 --> 00:33:01,716
This is where it is.

579
00:33:03,672 --> 00:33:04,404
Where?

580
00:33:06,007 --> 00:33:07,174
I don't
see anything.

581
00:33:07,199 --> 00:33:08,255
Look closer.

582
00:33:09,334 --> 00:33:11,193
Look at the shape
of the rocks.

583
00:33:11,895 --> 00:33:12,927
Look at the upper sections.

584
00:33:12,952 --> 00:33:14,687
How they could be
the hull of a ship.

585
00:33:14,816 --> 00:33:16,365
Yes, yes!

586
00:33:17,196 --> 00:33:19,880
In Noah’s time, this entire
plain was under water.

587
00:33:20,357 --> 00:33:21,450
See how the bottom
of the hull

588
00:33:21,475 --> 00:33:24,021
must be embedded in what
was once the sea floor.

589
00:33:25,834 --> 00:33:27,763
We did it.
We found it.

590
00:33:30,713 --> 00:33:31,819
Whatever it is,

591
00:33:31,924 --> 00:33:34,025
It has one hell
of an energy footprint.

592
00:33:34,050 --> 00:33:36,513
But I'm gonna send my men
down there first just in case.

593
00:33:37,601 --> 00:33:39,154
Stand back!
Over here!

594
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:41,974
This must the section
that leads to underground.

595
00:33:41,999 --> 00:33:43,169
I said stand back!

596
00:33:43,194 --> 00:33:44,943
All right, but don't
touch anything.

597
00:33:45,683 --> 00:33:48,185
Relax, doc.
It's petrified.

598
00:33:48,210 --> 00:33:49,591
I'm not gonna break it.

599
00:33:51,314 --> 00:33:53,177
Come on,
let's go, y'all.

600
00:33:54,372 --> 00:33:55,411
Get down there.

601
00:34:06,026 --> 00:34:07,108
All clear!

602
00:34:07,996 --> 00:34:10,130
Men, stand down.

603
00:34:10,307 --> 00:34:11,286
yes, sir!

604
00:34:17,893 --> 00:34:19,794
It looks
just as it's written.

605
00:34:27,525 --> 00:34:29,029
So you gonna
open it up, doc?

606
00:34:29,759 --> 00:34:32,427
No, I'm not gonna
open it up. This...

607
00:34:32,881 --> 00:34:34,974
is a priceless
archaeological relic

608
00:34:34,999 --> 00:34:37,318
found on what could be
Noah's Ark.

609
00:34:37,668 --> 00:34:38,864
I'm not touching anything

610
00:34:39,587 --> 00:34:41,388
until this site
is properly secured,

611
00:34:42,045 --> 00:34:44,544
and then we get it back to the
states and open it up there.

612
00:34:44,681 --> 00:34:46,182
Doc, I'm not
debating with you.

613
00:34:46,756 --> 00:34:48,505
This box is pumping
an energy signal

614
00:34:48,530 --> 00:34:50,531
the D. I. A. sent me after.

615
00:34:50,556 --> 00:34:53,154
So either you open it up
or I will.

616
00:34:53,240 --> 00:34:54,396
with some C-4.

617
00:34:54,454 --> 00:34:55,341
C-4, check!

618
00:34:55,366 --> 00:34:58,068
No, no, all right,
all right, all right.

619
00:34:59,140 --> 00:35:01,575
We'll set up a port-a-lab
in base camp

620
00:35:01,600 --> 00:35:03,534
and get it up there.

621
00:35:04,053 --> 00:35:05,720
Thought you'd
see it my way.

622
00:35:07,394 --> 00:35:09,216
Men, get to it!

623
00:35:09,241 --> 00:35:11,091
Carefully!
Carefully.

624
00:35:32,225 --> 00:35:33,840
All right,
put it over there.

625
00:35:40,603 --> 00:35:43,013
This is the gopher-wood cage
they put the demon in.

626
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:44,638
Are you sure
we want to open it?

627
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,146
Whatever was in this crate
is long dead.

628
00:35:48,772 --> 00:35:50,732
But then where's
the energy coming from?

629
00:35:50,998 --> 00:35:53,099
We're about to find
that out.

630
00:35:55,529 --> 00:35:57,240
Goggles, everybody.

631
00:35:58,468 --> 00:36:00,903
All right, lasing.

632
00:36:18,851 --> 00:36:19,686
Okay.

633
00:36:49,927 --> 00:36:50,857
Did you see that?

634
00:36:50,890 --> 00:36:52,919
It moved.
It's not possible.

635
00:36:53,215 --> 00:36:55,560
Yeah, maybe someone
should tell it that.

636
00:37:01,528 --> 00:37:02,561
Run!

637
00:37:15,378 --> 00:37:16,990
What the hell
was that?

638
00:37:18,604 --> 00:37:19,740
Where the hell is it?

639
00:37:19,765 --> 00:37:21,332
It went that way, major!
What was that thing?

640
00:37:21,357 --> 00:37:23,357
Damned if I know.
Get Martinez!

641
00:37:23,382 --> 00:37:24,883
We got two men down
in there!

642
00:37:24,908 --> 00:37:27,890
Martinez, we have a medical
emergency in the lab tent.

643
00:37:27,915 --> 00:37:29,115
Do you copy? Over.

644
00:37:32,456 --> 00:37:33,823
No! Aah!

645
00:37:33,923 --> 00:37:35,123
Argh!

646
00:37:35,191 --> 00:37:37,451
No, no! Aah!

647
00:37:39,255 --> 00:37:41,289
No! Aah!

648
00:37:46,599 --> 00:37:48,209
Get that sucker!

649
00:37:51,746 --> 00:37:54,448
Watson!
Go! Go after it!

650
00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:58,719
If you get it in your sights,
send it back to hell!

651
00:37:58,942 --> 00:38:01,063
Soldier, you stay with me!

652
00:38:01,088 --> 00:38:02,805
Major...
Solider!

653
00:38:02,830 --> 00:38:06,102
No can do. 
Don't you die on me! Martinez!

654
00:38:06,244 --> 00:38:07,039
Zeke!

655
00:38:07,551 --> 00:38:08,149
No.

656
00:38:08,276 --> 00:38:11,256
You guys get to the APC. Lock yourselves
in. You guys should be safe there.

657
00:38:11,281 --> 00:38:12,094
Let's go.
Just leave him?

658
00:38:12,119 --> 00:38:14,019
No, let's go, let's go,
let's go, come on!

659
00:38:23,017 --> 00:38:26,586
Here it comes!
Everybody run!

660
00:38:29,663 --> 00:38:31,203
If you guys are gonna do
something,

661
00:38:31,228 --> 00:38:32,875
now would be a good time!

662
00:38:33,444 --> 00:38:34,508
Get out of the way!

663
00:38:34,533 --> 00:38:36,211
 if we shoot, we're gonna
take out the generator.

664
00:38:36,236 --> 00:38:37,532
To hell with it!
Aah!

665
00:39:02,038 --> 00:39:02,938
Come on.

666
00:39:09,488 --> 00:39:10,562
Is it dead?

667
00:39:10,806 --> 00:39:12,407
Lost it when it
took out the generator.

668
00:39:12,513 --> 00:39:13,625
Show me a body!

669
00:39:15,524 --> 00:39:16,578
Not dead, sir.

670
00:39:17,206 --> 00:39:19,563
You mean that thing
survived the explosion?

671
00:39:22,188 --> 00:39:24,469
No body, no blood.
Just tracks into the desert.

672
00:39:24,556 --> 00:39:25,493
Mount up!

673
00:39:25,518 --> 00:39:27,172
We're gonna hunt it down
and kill it.

674
00:39:27,612 --> 00:39:28,203
Hutch!

675
00:39:28,622 --> 00:39:29,407
Russell,

676
00:39:29,993 --> 00:39:30,805
it's Jo.

677
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:32,211
You okay?

678
00:39:32,236 --> 00:39:35,295
Take the APC and get those
civilians back to camp liberty.

679
00:39:35,711 --> 00:39:38,203
Is it over?
Yeah, it's over.

680
00:39:38,934 --> 00:39:40,235
Did we get it?

681
00:39:42,586 --> 00:39:43,086
No.

682
00:39:43,583 --> 00:39:44,852
We have a problem, sir.

683
00:39:44,978 --> 00:39:46,930
I don't like problems,
corporal.

684
00:39:48,487 --> 00:39:50,258
Well, that creature
took out most of our fuel

685
00:39:50,283 --> 00:39:51,469
with that generator.

686
00:39:51,494 --> 00:39:53,657
What we've got left is not
enough for all the vehicles.

687
00:39:53,920 --> 00:39:55,586
And this was
my favorite shirt.

688
00:39:55,611 --> 00:39:56,946
Well, you stay here
an protect the civilians,

689
00:39:56,971 --> 00:39:58,664
and I'll be back for you.
Yes, sir.

690
00:39:58,723 --> 00:40:01,047
What?!
No, no, no, no.

691
00:40:01,072 --> 00:40:03,140
You are not gonna
leave us here.

692
00:40:03,165 --> 00:40:04,872
You do as I say, professor.

693
00:40:04,897 --> 00:40:06,282
Get in that damn APC

694
00:40:06,307 --> 00:40:08,101
and don't come out
till I get back!

695
00:40:08,126 --> 00:40:08,922
You listen to me.

696
00:40:08,947 --> 00:40:10,969
I want my people
out of here now!

697
00:40:11,175 --> 00:40:13,250
I don't care how many stripes
you have on your sleeve.

698
00:40:13,517 --> 00:40:15,751
Your job
is to protect us!

699
00:40:15,776 --> 00:40:18,625
If you shut up and listen to me,
that's what I'm gonna do.

700
00:40:18,650 --> 00:40:20,985
If one of my people
gets hurt,

701
00:40:21,145 --> 00:40:22,607
I'm coming after you.

702
00:40:23,050 --> 00:40:25,865
These people's lives
are in my hands.

703
00:40:26,310 --> 00:40:27,740
Welcome to my world.

704
00:40:27,859 --> 00:40:29,396
That thing just killed
two of my men.

705
00:40:29,421 --> 00:40:31,443
I'm sure as hell
not gonna let it get away.

706
00:40:31,629 --> 00:40:32,341
Here!

707
00:40:33,547 --> 00:40:35,763
Nothing gets through
the APC armor, nothing!

708
00:40:35,926 --> 00:40:37,591
Can't we just call
for help?

709
00:40:38,216 --> 00:40:41,084
Ma'am, all our communications
been trashed.

710
00:40:41,238 --> 00:40:43,185
That thing is
getting away as we speak.

711
00:40:43,537 --> 00:40:44,717
It's almost dawn.

712
00:40:44,741 --> 00:40:46,241
I will be back
before noon.

713
00:40:46,774 --> 00:40:47,888
Now it's on you.

714
00:40:56,548 --> 00:40:59,374
It's kind of creepy that they carry
their own body bags with them.

715
00:40:59,773 --> 00:41:00,622
It's Iraq.

716
00:41:00,977 --> 00:41:02,748
The sad reality
is they're standard.

717
00:41:05,118 --> 00:41:06,285
I didn't sign up
for this.

718
00:41:07,032 --> 00:41:08,372
None of us did.

719
00:41:14,130 --> 00:41:15,615
We have to set this right.

720
00:41:17,240 --> 00:41:19,505
Look, I can deal
with being in a war zone.

721
00:41:19,530 --> 00:41:20,380
Hell, it's scary.

722
00:41:20,405 --> 00:41:22,365
But to be a part of
an archaeological discovery,

723
00:41:22,390 --> 00:41:23,638
this important to find.

724
00:41:24,045 --> 00:41:27,425
I'm in. but this thing,
this creature...

725
00:41:28,685 --> 00:41:30,755
I don't do
razor-sharp teeth.

726
00:41:31,508 --> 00:41:32,482
Radio's toast.

727
00:41:32,507 --> 00:41:34,935
We should bed down
in the APC, get some rest.

728
00:41:35,113 --> 00:41:36,919
Nicholas, we made
a huge mistake.

729
00:41:36,944 --> 00:41:39,341
Yeah, well, you can't put
the genie back in the bottle.

730
00:41:39,366 --> 00:41:40,380
That is just it.

731
00:41:40,405 --> 00:41:42,310
I have been studying
these scrolls.

732
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:44,302
It says that
if this creature is released,

733
00:41:44,327 --> 00:41:47,129
an age of darkness will
descend upon all mankind.

734
00:41:47,333 --> 00:41:48,849
The beginning
will mark the end.

735
00:41:48,970 --> 00:41:51,857
Are you saying that by
releasing this demon

736
00:41:51,882 --> 00:41:53,740
we've triggered
the apocalypse?

737
00:41:53,843 --> 00:41:55,510
I'm saying that
we put this creature

738
00:41:55,535 --> 00:41:57,161
right back in its prison.

739
00:41:57,418 --> 00:41:58,607
Oh, Ava, I don't know.

740
00:41:58,632 --> 00:42:00,208
Nicholas, you just saw
this creature

741
00:42:00,233 --> 00:42:02,271
that's from the time of Noah
come back to life.

742
00:42:02,296 --> 00:42:03,716
Now if you do not believe
in this prophecy,

743
00:42:03,741 --> 00:42:04,958
You never will.

744
00:42:04,983 --> 00:42:06,150
She's right, doc.

745
00:42:06,427 --> 00:42:07,794
I'm not a religious guy, but...

746
00:42:08,290 --> 00:42:10,536
I'm starting to give this whole
bible thing another look.

747
00:42:10,561 --> 00:42:13,599
There has to be a logical
explanation for this.

748
00:42:14,041 --> 00:42:17,615
It could be some prehistoric
creature from the past.

749
00:42:17,640 --> 00:42:20,255
A leftover from the age
of the dinosaurs.

750
00:42:20,381 --> 00:42:21,138
Come on!

751
00:42:21,163 --> 00:42:21,997
No.

752
00:42:22,313 --> 00:42:24,755
We've known certain
species of fish

753
00:42:24,780 --> 00:42:26,958
that have been extinct
for 70,000 years

754
00:42:26,983 --> 00:42:28,232
until someone pulls one up

755
00:42:28,257 --> 00:42:30,521
in a fishing boat in 1938.
Coelacanth.

756
00:42:30,546 --> 00:42:31,458
That's right.

757
00:42:31,483 --> 00:42:32,505
Yeah, well,
I'll tell you what.

758
00:42:32,530 --> 00:42:34,802
The only thing I believe in
is staying alive.

759
00:42:34,959 --> 00:42:36,404
And right now,
the best place to be

760
00:42:36,429 --> 00:42:38,911
is between two inches
of plate armor out in the APC.

761
00:42:39,134 --> 00:42:40,490
Just in case
your little friend decides

762
00:42:40,515 --> 00:42:42,349
He wants to come back
and have some more fun time.

763
00:42:42,661 --> 00:42:44,389
I'm with him.
Me too.

764
00:42:44,413 --> 00:42:46,147
All right, he's right.
Let's go, come on.

765
00:42:52,948 --> 00:42:54,349
You see anything?

766
00:42:56,189 --> 00:42:57,022
Negative.

767
00:43:17,526 --> 00:43:18,771
You summoned me.

768
00:43:19,466 --> 00:43:21,649
This is a very
important day, Belus.

769
00:43:22,279 --> 00:43:23,865
Whether it beckons
our salvation

770
00:43:23,890 --> 00:43:26,779
or our destruction is
completely in your hands.

771
00:43:28,255 --> 00:43:29,536
I don't understand.

772
00:43:29,561 --> 00:43:31,818
The genesis scroll
has been found.

773
00:43:32,854 --> 00:43:35,458
But it has eluded
our own people for centuries.

774
00:43:35,735 --> 00:43:38,107
Who?
Who's made the discovery?

775
00:43:38,261 --> 00:43:40,591
An American professor,
Nicholas Zavatterro.

776
00:43:41,263 --> 00:43:44,341
Our spies tells us he already
mounted an expedition.

777
00:43:44,735 --> 00:43:46,607
The secret is
in grave danger.

778
00:43:46,632 --> 00:43:49,365
The knowledge must not
be allowed to pass

779
00:43:49,390 --> 00:43:51,324
into the wrong hands.

780
00:43:51,455 --> 00:43:53,552
If it does
and they release it,

781
00:43:53,577 --> 00:43:55,078
We are lost.

782
00:43:55,519 --> 00:43:58,333
I will have it back in our
possession within 48 hours.

783
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:01,840
You must do
whatever is necessary.

784
00:44:05,231 --> 00:44:06,482
I will not fail you.

785
00:44:07,879 --> 00:44:08,935
If you do,

786
00:44:09,490 --> 00:44:12,177
you will fail a great
deal more than just me.

787
00:44:41,214 --> 00:44:42,147
Hold it, hold it!

788
00:44:54,169 --> 00:44:55,075
What is it?

789
00:44:55,341 --> 00:44:56,991
Tracks.
They go up that way.

790
00:44:59,488 --> 00:45:00,788
What's in that direction?

791
00:45:01,012 --> 00:45:02,357
There's nothing
on the map, sir.

792
00:45:05,802 --> 00:45:07,724
It's heading that way
for a reason.

793
00:45:08,532 --> 00:45:09,832
Come on, let's go!

794
00:46:02,202 --> 00:46:02,997
Well?

795
00:46:03,949 --> 00:46:05,068
That's where they stop.

796
00:46:05,316 --> 00:46:06,349
So it could be
anywhere.

797
00:46:09,904 --> 00:46:10,990
You guys hear that?

798
00:46:11,472 --> 00:46:12,786
Where's it coming from?

799
00:46:18,010 --> 00:46:19,107
Out there.

800
00:46:19,481 --> 00:46:20,959
Lock and load.
Let's go!

801
00:46:27,149 --> 00:46:28,483
Fire it up!

802
00:46:56,674 --> 00:46:58,349
Coles, left flank.

803
00:46:58,471 --> 00:46:59,904
Wilson, right flank.

804
00:47:00,399 --> 00:47:01,466
I'm on point.

805
00:47:02,481 --> 00:47:03,427
Good hunting.

806
00:47:53,854 --> 00:47:55,286
It's gone!
Double back!

807
00:48:07,078 --> 00:48:08,091
Come and get me...

808
00:48:09,052 --> 00:48:12,146
You stinking bag of bones.

809
00:48:34,888 --> 00:48:35,888
Yaah!
Don't shoot!

810
00:48:36,245 --> 00:48:37,607
I almost killed you.

811
00:48:37,762 --> 00:48:39,146
I thought you were
that thing.

812
00:48:39,171 --> 00:48:40,232
How could you possibly
mistake me

813
00:48:40,257 --> 00:48:41,457
for whatever
the hell that is?

814
00:48:41,737 --> 00:48:42,825
You're right.

815
00:48:43,295 --> 00:48:45,654
Now that you mention it,
you are a lot uglier.

816
00:48:46,255 --> 00:48:49,090
Aah! Aah!

817
00:48:51,393 --> 00:48:52,240
Eat this! And this!

818
00:49:02,464 --> 00:49:03,583
Y'all all right?

819
00:49:09,477 --> 00:49:11,497
Oh, you want to play
hard to get.

820
00:49:13,837 --> 00:49:14,849
Okay.

821
00:49:17,141 --> 00:49:18,255
I'll play with you.

822
00:49:28,180 --> 00:49:29,482
get out of the way!

823
00:49:43,318 --> 00:49:45,450
Are you okay?
Are you okay?

824
00:49:45,491 --> 00:49:47,693
 she probably doesn't
speak English, smart guy.

825
00:49:49,010 --> 00:49:50,722
Wilson, you okay?
Yes, sir!

826
00:49:50,747 --> 00:49:51,255
Coles?

827
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:52,740
Just a scratch, sir.

828
00:49:53,009 --> 00:49:54,476
Let's keep moving.

829
00:49:58,955 --> 00:50:01,060
Major? 
Major?

830
00:50:02,435 --> 00:50:03,263
It's gone.

831
00:50:03,843 --> 00:50:04,669
Let's head back.

832
00:50:04,694 --> 00:50:06,494
We got some civilians
to babysit.

833
00:50:12,775 --> 00:50:13,747
Light it up!

834
00:50:26,275 --> 00:50:27,560
We lost it.
Any contact?

835
00:50:27,585 --> 00:50:28,885
Hit us hard last night
in the APC,

836
00:50:28,910 --> 00:50:30,243
but it's been quiet
since then, sir.

837
00:50:30,375 --> 00:50:31,740
Come on, follow me. 
Yes, sir.

838
00:50:33,099 --> 00:50:34,021
Professor!

839
00:50:34,943 --> 00:50:36,474
We need to have
a little talk.

840
00:50:39,430 --> 00:50:41,341
Now I don't know
what that thing was,

841
00:50:41,492 --> 00:50:43,513
But two of my men are dead
because of it,

842
00:50:43,669 --> 00:50:45,177
And I want some answers.

843
00:50:45,623 --> 00:50:46,819
I don't have
any answers yet.

844
00:50:46,843 --> 00:50:48,786
What does the scroll say
the ark was carrying?

845
00:50:48,912 --> 00:50:50,777
The ark was used
to banish the darkness.

846
00:50:50,802 --> 00:50:52,388
What the hell
is that supposed to mean?

847
00:50:53,440 --> 00:50:54,904
It's some sort
of animal.

848
00:50:55,914 --> 00:50:58,349
Listen, guys,
no damn animal

849
00:50:58,374 --> 00:50:59,474
Can do that kind of damage

850
00:50:59,683 --> 00:51:01,786
or take the kind of
firepower I shot at it.

851
00:51:02,678 --> 00:51:04,919
This creature is a
holdover from the time

852
00:51:04,944 --> 00:51:06,630
before god created man.

853
00:51:07,297 --> 00:51:10,272
This is not something that's
supposed to coexist with mankind.

854
00:51:10,337 --> 00:51:11,872
It was not supposed
to survive.

855
00:51:12,117 --> 00:51:13,451
Well, I got news
for y'all.

856
00:51:13,940 --> 00:51:15,608
It survived
and it's out there.

857
00:51:15,659 --> 00:51:17,060
If it gets
in the wrong hands,

858
00:51:17,143 --> 00:51:18,708
it's gonna be one hell
of a weapon.

859
00:51:19,018 --> 00:51:20,419
We shot everything
we could at it,

860
00:51:20,444 --> 00:51:21,711
and we couldn't kill it.

861
00:51:22,033 --> 00:51:23,400
We've seen what it can do,

862
00:51:23,498 --> 00:51:25,029
and we've got to stop it.

863
00:51:25,368 --> 00:51:27,732
Screw that. 
I say we get the hell out of here.

864
00:51:27,930 --> 00:51:29,943
Yeah, I need to get
my team back to safety.

865
00:51:29,968 --> 00:51:32,013
I don't want them running
around after some animal.

866
00:51:32,038 --> 00:51:33,794
I will go with you,
but not them.

867
00:51:34,001 --> 00:51:37,185
If we split up,
we'd be twice as vulnerable.

868
00:51:37,381 --> 00:51:39,515
I can send your people
back with hutch.

869
00:51:39,622 --> 00:51:40,675
It could attack them,

870
00:51:40,700 --> 00:51:42,981
and they won't have enough
firepower to protect themselves.

871
00:51:43,514 --> 00:51:46,466
The major's right.
We are going to do this.

872
00:51:46,695 --> 00:51:48,990
God ordered Noah
to banish this thing.

873
00:51:49,966 --> 00:51:51,271
Oh, his bad.

874
00:51:51,834 --> 00:51:53,271
What's that got
to do with us?

875
00:51:54,041 --> 00:51:55,615
The scroll is a code.

876
00:51:56,083 --> 00:51:58,943
It talks of this creature
Destroying entire lands.

877
00:51:59,228 --> 00:52:01,458
Of sending the world
into a time of darkness.

878
00:52:01,855 --> 00:52:04,294
We're responsible for
letting this creature out,

879
00:52:04,319 --> 00:52:05,720
Which means
we're responsible

880
00:52:05,745 --> 00:52:07,125
for bringing about
the prophecy.

881
00:52:07,150 --> 00:52:08,466
You really believe that.

882
00:52:10,794 --> 00:52:12,638
It was right
in front of you.

883
00:52:12,663 --> 00:52:14,164
You saw it
with your own two eyes.

884
00:52:14,189 --> 00:52:15,599
How can you deny that?

885
00:52:16,277 --> 00:52:17,208
I say we do it.

886
00:52:17,571 --> 00:52:19,708
Great, fine.
How?

887
00:52:21,005 --> 00:52:22,896
Okay, I managed
to decipher this code

888
00:52:22,921 --> 00:52:24,044
a little farther
last night.

889
00:52:24,883 --> 00:52:28,169
Right here it talks about
how god gave Noah a staff.

890
00:52:28,630 --> 00:52:31,747
It has a golden tip and it's
imbued with special powers.

891
00:52:32,014 --> 00:52:33,279
It will allow the faithful

892
00:52:33,304 --> 00:52:34,982
to pierce
the heart of darkness.

893
00:52:35,214 --> 00:52:37,865
And only by doing this
will the creature be stopped.

894
00:52:37,890 --> 00:52:38,810
What does that mean?

895
00:52:39,087 --> 00:52:40,888
It means we have to find
the staff.

896
00:52:41,852 --> 00:52:43,293
Let me see that
for a minute.

897
00:52:43,740 --> 00:52:45,591
well, where would
we even begin to look?

898
00:52:48,789 --> 00:52:49,740
All right, these glyphs.

899
00:52:49,765 --> 00:52:51,632
Have you been able
to figure them out yet?

900
00:52:51,886 --> 00:52:54,240
No, it's unlike anything
I've seen before.

901
00:52:54,650 --> 00:52:56,700
I think they're numbers,
not letters.

902
00:53:00,708 --> 00:53:02,224
All right, this area
right here.

903
00:53:02,312 --> 00:53:04,630
Is that the section that's
talking about Noah's staff?

904
00:53:04,822 --> 00:53:06,201
Yes, yes.

905
00:53:06,241 --> 00:53:07,810
But it goes on to say
that Noah lived

906
00:53:07,835 --> 00:53:10,279
to be 700 years old
and then he died.

907
00:53:10,686 --> 00:53:11,404
That's it!

908
00:53:11,449 --> 00:53:13,984
They're coordinates.
For what?

909
00:53:14,380 --> 00:53:16,107
If I'm right,
Noah's tomb.

910
00:53:17,310 --> 00:53:19,169
And his staff
is buried with him?

911
00:53:20,802 --> 00:53:21,607
Major!

912
00:53:22,310 --> 00:53:23,544
Can you get us here?

913
00:53:24,208 --> 00:53:25,375
I'll get you there.

914
00:53:33,907 --> 00:53:36,646
I've hacked into American
military satellites.

915
00:53:36,671 --> 00:53:37,618
According to the imagery,

916
00:53:37,643 --> 00:53:40,068
there has been some very recent
activity where the legend says

917
00:53:40,093 --> 00:53:41,536
the Ark may have
gone down.

918
00:53:42,164 --> 00:53:43,575
It's possible
they have found it.

919
00:53:43,728 --> 00:53:45,419
You must get there
before they do.

920
00:53:45,493 --> 00:53:47,894
If they find the Ark,
the world is in grave danger.

921
00:53:48,023 --> 00:53:48,935
I understand.

922
00:53:58,510 --> 00:54:00,841
# take back your energy #

923
00:54:00,866 --> 00:54:03,349
# take back your new way #

924
00:54:03,374 --> 00:54:05,744
# her lipstick smeared
all over #

925
00:54:05,769 --> 00:54:07,870
# me not know a thing #

926
00:54:13,219 --> 00:54:14,613
# #

927
00:54:14,638 --> 00:54:18,380
# he says his mind can't
hold that weight again #

928
00:54:19,022 --> 00:54:21,691
# you know you've got #

929
00:54:21,716 --> 00:54:24,285
# you know you've got #

930
00:54:24,310 --> 00:54:29,896
# the way to show me
how you feel #

931
00:54:29,921 --> 00:54:33,419
# this time will come... #

932
00:54:34,872 --> 00:54:36,779
Wait, what are they
called again?

933
00:54:36,898 --> 00:54:38,107
The noachidae.

934
00:54:38,132 --> 00:54:39,950
They're descendants
of Noah.

935
00:54:40,280 --> 00:54:43,154
They're a secret brotherhood.
The first masons.

936
00:54:43,694 --> 00:54:46,310
Some say the most powerful
secret society in the world.

937
00:54:46,455 --> 00:54:48,654
They're the ones who would
have built Noah's tomb.

938
00:54:48,679 --> 00:54:49,880
And guarded it.

939
00:54:49,931 --> 00:54:51,904
Kept it secret
for thousands of years.

940
00:54:52,034 --> 00:54:53,552
You actually believe
in that?

941
00:54:55,087 --> 00:54:56,833
I don't know
what to believe anymore.

942
00:54:58,009 --> 00:54:59,509
It's a start.

943
00:55:13,099 --> 00:55:15,267
# #

944
00:56:07,892 --> 00:56:09,192
Unh!

945
00:56:11,254 --> 00:56:12,821
Aah!

946
00:56:19,203 --> 00:56:20,437
Unh!

947
00:56:25,269 --> 00:56:26,369
aah!

948
00:56:38,245 --> 00:56:40,638
They found it.
It is here.

949
00:56:41,620 --> 00:56:43,380
I always knew
within my heart...

950
00:56:43,564 --> 00:56:46,107
that the legend was true,
but to see it with my eyes...

951
00:56:46,870 --> 00:56:47,849
Over here!

952
00:57:03,163 --> 00:57:04,091
Yes.

953
00:57:04,603 --> 00:57:05,950
We were too late.
I'm sorry.

954
00:57:06,846 --> 00:57:07,979
Yes.
Yes, sir.

955
00:57:08,004 --> 00:57:09,591
Yes, we will find them.

956
00:57:09,786 --> 00:57:11,116
See that you do.

957
00:57:49,881 --> 00:57:50,779
Don't!

958
00:57:51,855 --> 00:57:53,615
Might be a booby trap.

959
00:57:54,628 --> 00:57:55,889
Stand down!

960
00:57:56,566 --> 00:57:57,708
All clear!

961
00:58:07,763 --> 00:58:09,029
What did this?

962
00:58:10,331 --> 00:58:11,810
I'll give you one guess.

963
00:58:13,218 --> 00:58:15,586
No military operation
done this.

964
00:58:15,731 --> 00:58:17,532
No impact craters.

965
00:58:17,968 --> 00:58:19,029
No burns.

966
00:58:19,178 --> 00:58:21,076
No bombs or artillery
done this.

967
00:58:21,896 --> 00:58:23,919
Men getting torn apart.

968
00:58:26,587 --> 00:58:28,740
It had to be your monster
did this, professor.

969
00:58:28,824 --> 00:58:30,958
It got here
before we did.

970
00:58:30,983 --> 00:58:32,154
It's trying to outflank us,

971
00:58:33,146 --> 00:58:34,911
cut us off.
But how?

972
00:58:35,592 --> 00:58:39,130
I mean, that would imply some
level of organized thinking.

973
00:58:39,155 --> 00:58:40,497
A higher intelligence.

974
00:58:40,776 --> 00:58:41,693
Don't look at me.

975
00:58:41,718 --> 00:58:42,785
Y'all two the genius.

976
00:58:42,937 --> 00:58:44,237
You let the damn thing out.

977
00:58:45,094 --> 00:58:46,333
Why would it do this?

978
00:58:46,358 --> 00:58:49,060
Maybe he knows
we're trying to kill it.

979
00:58:55,721 --> 00:58:57,189
Unh!

980
00:59:04,837 --> 00:59:06,204
Don't get any ideas.

981
00:59:08,087 --> 00:59:09,622
Furthest thing
from my mind.

982
00:59:13,651 --> 00:59:14,427
You see him?

983
00:59:14,452 --> 00:59:16,587
Over there!
One of the survivors!

984
00:59:20,814 --> 00:59:22,414
I ain't got time for this.

985
00:59:26,494 --> 00:59:28,466
Aah! Unh!

986
00:59:32,975 --> 00:59:35,185
Welcome to paradise.

987
00:59:36,012 --> 00:59:37,630
Come on, let's move out!

988
00:59:44,677 --> 00:59:46,644
We should be
coming up on it.

989
00:59:49,755 --> 00:59:51,161
There!
Right there!

990
00:59:51,186 --> 00:59:52,325
Right to the right!

991
00:59:56,791 --> 00:59:58,658
Men, secure the area!

992
01:00:00,372 --> 01:00:02,747
Corporal, watch out back.

993
01:00:02,865 --> 01:00:03,553
Yes, sir!

994
01:00:04,890 --> 01:00:07,091
Noah's tomb should be
subterranean.

995
01:00:07,683 --> 01:00:09,740
Someone excavated the site.

996
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:12,273
Yeah, from the looks
of it maybe...

997
01:00:13,116 --> 01:00:14,794
40 years ago or so...

998
01:00:16,065 --> 01:00:17,224
There!
Found it!

999
01:00:23,583 --> 01:00:25,017
Looks like a map room.

1000
01:00:28,533 --> 01:00:29,966
Russell, hand me a light.

1001
01:00:46,841 --> 01:00:47,700
Nicholas?

1002
01:00:49,749 --> 01:00:50,505
Down here.

1003
01:00:50,605 --> 01:00:51,544
Oh, my god.

1004
01:00:57,030 --> 01:00:58,568
He really lived here.

1005
01:01:04,907 --> 01:01:06,466
How do we know what
we're looking for?

1006
01:01:06,999 --> 01:01:08,100
I'm not sure.

1007
01:01:08,125 --> 01:01:09,161
Wait a minute.

1008
01:01:09,691 --> 01:01:10,919
There was this part
in the scroll

1009
01:01:10,944 --> 01:01:13,161
that I couldn't identify,
looks like measurements.

1010
01:01:13,381 --> 01:01:14,982
It's on this third
palimpsest.

1011
01:01:15,558 --> 01:01:16,427
Let me see.

1012
01:01:17,621 --> 01:01:20,380
Yeah, yeah,
this is a measurement,

1013
01:01:20,699 --> 01:01:24,865
But this is the...
alignment of the sun.

1014
01:01:25,223 --> 01:01:26,708
At its apex.

1015
01:01:27,794 --> 01:01:28,919
Ava, what time is it?

1016
01:01:28,944 --> 01:01:31,857
It's almost noon.
Okay, hurry.

1017
01:01:31,882 --> 01:01:33,458
I'm looking for a portal

1018
01:01:33,483 --> 01:01:35,232
or a hole in the ground somewhere.

1019
01:01:35,257 --> 01:01:36,138
Whoa, what about this?

1020
01:01:36,163 --> 01:01:37,419
That's it, good work.

1021
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:38,452
Uh,

1022
01:01:38,938 --> 01:01:41,630
we need a staff. 
A staff.

1023
01:01:42,116 --> 01:01:43,005
Ava, how long?

1024
01:01:43,275 --> 01:01:45,343
Um, almost four cubit.

1025
01:01:45,786 --> 01:01:47,419
Russell, these shovels
right here.

1026
01:01:47,444 --> 01:01:49,341
Pull on that.
Pull.

1027
01:01:52,102 --> 01:01:55,404
One more, come on.
Got it.

1028
01:01:59,052 --> 01:02:00,419
Well done.

1029
01:02:16,098 --> 01:02:17,075
That's it.

1030
01:02:17,472 --> 01:02:19,880
Looks like it's right underneath
that central chamber.

1031
01:02:20,853 --> 01:02:22,450
All right, let's go.

1032
01:02:22,475 --> 01:02:23,232
Okay.

1033
01:02:26,658 --> 01:02:30,349
Yeah, this is it.
This is it.

1034
01:02:34,753 --> 01:02:36,607
Okay, we're going in.

1035
01:02:36,632 --> 01:02:37,755
Not without me.

1036
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:52,091
Russell,
let there be light.

1037
01:03:06,861 --> 01:03:07,872
It's been raided.

1038
01:03:11,914 --> 01:03:13,982
Maybe we read
the scroll incorrectly.

1039
01:03:14,015 --> 01:03:14,673
It is in here.

1040
01:03:14,698 --> 01:03:16,716
Or maybe this is
a wild goose chase.

1041
01:03:16,823 --> 01:03:18,419
Maybe we aren't meant
to stop it.

1042
01:03:18,444 --> 01:03:19,912
No, no, no, no.

1043
01:03:20,574 --> 01:03:23,646
Ava, look at
this structure.

1044
01:03:23,748 --> 01:03:25,435
There's something
behind this wall.

1045
01:03:25,460 --> 01:03:27,411
See how it stops right here. 
Yes.

1046
01:03:27,436 --> 01:03:29,216
This may be
what we're looking for.

1047
01:03:30,625 --> 01:03:32,669
Oh, I wish I could do 
this the right way, but...

1048
01:03:33,559 --> 01:03:35,169
We're gonna
have to improvise.

1049
01:03:39,815 --> 01:03:40,388
There.

1050
01:03:40,887 --> 01:03:43,607
Yep, everybody give me
a hand with this.

1051
01:03:44,162 --> 01:03:46,482
Doc, you're not gonna do
what I think you, are you?

1052
01:03:46,507 --> 01:03:47,216
Yes.

1053
01:03:47,241 --> 01:03:49,386
But after all those lectures
on respecting the artifacts?

1054
01:03:49,411 --> 01:03:50,836
Would you rather
sit here and wait

1055
01:03:50,861 --> 01:03:52,529
for that thing to come
back and kill us?

1056
01:03:53,116 --> 01:03:54,683
You're right.
I'm all over it.

1057
01:03:54,985 --> 01:03:56,825
Come on, everybody.
Major.

1058
01:03:59,467 --> 01:04:00,667
All right, everybody.

1059
01:04:01,524 --> 01:04:04,943
One, two, three!

1060
01:04:20,951 --> 01:04:22,619
Hey, doc.  
Yeah?

1061
01:04:22,742 --> 01:04:23,943
Here you go.

1062
01:04:26,456 --> 01:04:27,974
That's good, Major.

1063
01:04:39,342 --> 01:04:40,333
They are here.

1064
01:04:40,549 --> 01:04:42,224
Put it down, put it down!

1065
01:04:45,064 --> 01:04:47,248
Oh, man,
this can't be good.

1066
01:04:49,157 --> 01:04:51,255
Keep an eye on them.
You come with me.

1067
01:04:52,586 --> 01:04:54,606
Put your weapons down now!

1068
01:04:54,631 --> 01:04:55,965
Drop the weapon now!

1069
01:04:56,205 --> 01:04:56,872
Drop the weapon!

1070
01:04:56,897 --> 01:04:59,388
Put the weapon down, man!
Put it down, man!

1071
01:04:59,413 --> 01:05:02,122
Put the weapon down, man!
Put the weapon down.

1072
01:05:02,155 --> 01:05:04,256
Where you going?
Where you going?

1073
01:05:04,420 --> 01:05:06,354
Where you going?
Where you going?

1074
01:05:06,379 --> 01:05:08,052
Get away from the door, man. 
Never gonna happen.

1075
01:05:08,077 --> 01:05:10,545
Drop it. 
Put the weapon down!

1076
01:05:11,053 --> 01:05:14,185
Get away from the door!
Never gonna happen, man!

1077
01:05:14,210 --> 01:05:16,611
It's never gonna happen. 
I'm not playing with you.

1078
01:05:20,985 --> 01:05:21,985
Hold it.

1079
01:05:23,287 --> 01:05:25,060
Everybody watch your step.

1080
01:05:29,526 --> 01:05:31,560
Ava, there's
another cylinder.

1081
01:05:31,585 --> 01:05:33,294
It should have
a scroll in it.

1082
01:05:34,175 --> 01:05:35,802
It could lead us
to the staff.

1083
01:05:40,802 --> 01:05:41,969
Okay.

1084
01:05:47,808 --> 01:05:49,599
Aah!

1085
01:05:50,468 --> 01:05:52,402
Everybody run!

1086
01:05:52,759 --> 01:05:53,536
Unh!

1087
01:05:54,879 --> 01:05:56,075
Come on!

1088
01:05:59,591 --> 01:06:00,865
Come on! Run!

1089
01:06:07,641 --> 01:06:09,497
What's happening?
I don't know!

1090
01:06:10,464 --> 01:06:11,522
But I don't like it.

1091
01:06:12,805 --> 01:06:14,693
Joanna, look out!
Nicholas!

1092
01:06:15,938 --> 01:06:17,716
Come on, hurry!

1093
01:06:17,748 --> 01:06:20,483
I'm right behind you! Go!

1094
01:06:24,013 --> 01:06:26,114
Get out of here!
Let's go, come on!

1095
01:06:35,103 --> 01:06:36,458
Oh! Aah!

1096
01:06:37,148 --> 01:06:38,302
Unh!

1097
01:06:43,985 --> 01:06:45,019
Aah!

1098
01:06:48,184 --> 01:06:50,646
Nicholas! 
Nicholas!

1099
01:06:56,121 --> 01:06:57,740
Help me!

1100
01:06:58,854 --> 01:07:01,130
Help... whoa!

1101
01:07:10,501 --> 01:07:11,600
Where's Nicholas?

1102
01:07:13,567 --> 01:07:14,646
Just sit still.

1103
01:07:14,671 --> 01:07:16,872
He's still in here.
He's... no...

1104
01:07:16,897 --> 01:07:18,544
No, no, it's too late.
It's too late.

1105
01:07:18,569 --> 01:07:20,005
I'm sorry.
You can't make it.

1106
01:07:20,261 --> 01:07:21,911
Don't you tell me that!

1107
01:07:22,036 --> 01:07:23,670
Oh, my god, no!

1108
01:07:24,605 --> 01:07:25,935
I have a medical kit
in the back.

1109
01:07:38,638 --> 01:07:40,099
Aah!

1110
01:07:41,240 --> 01:07:42,418
Please!

1111
01:07:42,647 --> 01:07:44,515
Oh, no, no, no!

1112
01:07:45,568 --> 01:07:48,583
God, don't let me
die in here.

1113
01:07:49,860 --> 01:07:51,161
Not like this.

1114
01:07:53,677 --> 01:07:54,544
Aah!

1115
01:07:56,562 --> 01:08:00,138
Major, we got a situation!
Hostiles!

1116
01:08:00,163 --> 01:08:01,716
Get to cover,
get to cover!

1117
01:08:01,900 --> 01:08:02,919
Don't you move!

1118
01:08:03,430 --> 01:08:05,208
I'll put this bullet
right through your head.

1119
01:08:05,233 --> 01:08:07,818
Now get out of there!
Hurry up!

1120
01:08:10,357 --> 01:08:11,372
Turn around.

1121
01:08:12,359 --> 01:08:13,888
Now everybody come out,

1122
01:08:14,007 --> 01:08:16,142
Or I'm gonna put
a bullet in his head.

1123
01:08:21,850 --> 01:08:24,118
Corporal, get their guns!

1124
01:08:24,670 --> 01:08:25,966
Hands behind the head.

1125
01:08:26,696 --> 01:08:28,122
Who the hell are you?

1126
01:08:35,821 --> 01:08:36,654
Hey, honey.

1127
01:08:41,174 --> 01:08:43,075
Oh, thank god.

1128
01:08:43,483 --> 01:08:44,483
Oh!

1129
01:08:46,064 --> 01:08:48,665
Oh, my...
what happened?

1130
01:08:49,201 --> 01:08:50,990
I'm not sure
you'd believe it.

1131
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:52,997
How's Russell?

1132
01:08:53,796 --> 01:08:54,966
He's not good.

1133
01:08:59,269 --> 01:09:00,302
How's he doing?

1134
01:09:00,680 --> 01:09:01,638
Get up!

1135
01:09:03,914 --> 01:09:05,193
Now I ain't gonna
ask you again.

1136
01:09:05,218 --> 01:09:06,418
Be right back.

1137
01:09:09,329 --> 01:09:10,545
Who the hell are you?

1138
01:09:13,216 --> 01:09:14,474
Unh!

1139
01:09:15,546 --> 01:09:18,448
You answer him!
Who are you?

1140
01:09:18,548 --> 01:09:19,724
Where are you from?

1141
01:09:21,293 --> 01:09:23,599
I think the lady
asked you a question.

1142
01:09:23,769 --> 01:09:25,369
You're gonna giver her
an answer,

1143
01:09:25,394 --> 01:09:26,802
or I'm gonna kill you.

1144
01:09:29,101 --> 01:09:30,685
You're interested in this.

1145
01:09:30,916 --> 01:09:31,935
Careful.

1146
01:09:34,591 --> 01:09:36,091
Will you tell me
who you are?

1147
01:09:37,073 --> 01:09:39,074
The same people who have
worked for 5,000 years

1148
01:09:39,099 --> 01:09:40,435
to protect the secret.

1149
01:09:41,153 --> 01:09:42,521
The secret
you've unleashed.

1150
01:09:44,954 --> 01:09:46,021
You're Noachidae?

1151
01:09:49,471 --> 01:09:50,905
So the legend is true?

1152
01:09:52,349 --> 01:09:53,544
Where did you get that?

1153
01:09:53,682 --> 01:09:55,255
From my grandmother.
Why?

1154
01:10:03,723 --> 01:10:04,763
At ease.

1155
01:10:09,155 --> 01:10:10,277
Oh, my god.

1156
01:10:13,210 --> 01:10:13,982
What is that?

1157
01:10:14,007 --> 01:10:15,490
The symbol,
what does it mean?

1158
01:10:16,074 --> 01:10:17,875
It is a symbol of the order
to be passed down

1159
01:10:17,900 --> 01:10:19,404
from one generation
to the next.

1160
01:10:19,625 --> 01:10:21,661
No, this was special
because it was my mother's

1161
01:10:21,686 --> 01:10:23,677
and it was in my family
for generations.

1162
01:10:23,847 --> 01:10:25,560
My parents died
in a crash.

1163
01:10:25,585 --> 01:10:27,285
My grandmother raised me.

1164
01:10:27,737 --> 01:10:29,966
The... she...

1165
01:10:31,290 --> 01:10:33,966
You mean that my grandmother
is Noachidae?

1166
01:10:33,991 --> 01:10:35,810
Yes, as are you.

1167
01:10:35,892 --> 01:10:37,560
I don't... why wouldn't
she tell me that?

1168
01:10:37,900 --> 01:10:39,060
The knowledge is
only to be passed

1169
01:10:39,085 --> 01:10:42,087
when the child is 19,
not before.

1170
01:10:42,371 --> 01:10:44,272
She died when I was 16.

1171
01:10:44,481 --> 01:10:46,599
Wait, what does she
have to do with this?

1172
01:10:46,624 --> 01:10:48,333
Are you saying
she's a part of this?

1173
01:10:48,814 --> 01:10:50,762
The scroll's the first link
in the chain.

1174
01:10:51,125 --> 01:10:53,607
The scroll's location
and the secret it protected

1175
01:10:53,709 --> 01:10:56,489
Have been safely in our
possession for 5,000 years.

1176
01:10:56,831 --> 01:10:58,888
Christianity was not
even a religion.

1177
01:10:59,275 --> 01:11:01,411
A member of the order
renounced his vow

1178
01:11:01,436 --> 01:11:03,445
and threatened to reveal
the secret to the world.

1179
01:11:04,946 --> 01:11:06,593
He took the scroll. 
He hid it.

1180
01:11:07,694 --> 01:11:09,687
Neither he nor the scroll
were ever found.

1181
01:11:10,527 --> 01:11:13,753
Fearing discovery, the order
scattered itself around the world

1182
01:11:13,957 --> 01:11:15,695
And never giving up
on its true mission,

1183
01:11:15,823 --> 01:11:18,415
And searched the far corners
of the earth For that scroll.

1184
01:11:18,494 --> 01:11:19,952
But what about
the other scroll?

1185
01:11:20,067 --> 01:11:22,179
The scroll that was
inside Noah's tomb?

1186
01:11:22,443 --> 01:11:24,343
The order put it there
when we moved Noah’s body

1187
01:11:24,368 --> 01:11:25,820
to another
secret location.

1188
01:11:26,590 --> 01:11:27,957
It gives that location,

1189
01:11:28,627 --> 01:11:29,671
But it's too late now.

1190
01:11:30,295 --> 01:11:31,663
The secret
has been revealed.

1191
01:11:31,953 --> 01:11:35,046
And if we don't stop it now,
the world is doomed.

1192
01:11:35,071 --> 01:11:35,890
Stop it?

1193
01:11:36,576 --> 01:11:37,835
The desert
swallowed it whole.

1194
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:38,827
It's over.

1195
01:11:39,311 --> 01:11:40,070
It lives.

1196
01:11:40,474 --> 01:11:42,187
If you have read the scroll,
you know there's only

1197
01:11:42,212 --> 01:11:43,616
one way
to stop that creature.

1198
01:11:44,180 --> 01:11:45,099
Noah's staff.

1199
01:11:45,945 --> 01:11:47,280
And you know where it is.
Yes.

1200
01:11:47,328 --> 01:11:49,362
Look, you said it
yourself.

1201
01:11:49,492 --> 01:11:51,159
If we don't
capture this creature,

1202
01:11:51,184 --> 01:11:52,484
then the world
is doomed.

1203
01:11:52,565 --> 01:11:55,200
Now I understand that you
were sent here to stop us,

1204
01:11:55,394 --> 01:11:56,727
To protect your secret.

1205
01:11:56,919 --> 01:11:58,351
But it's too late
for that.

1206
01:11:58,709 --> 01:12:00,010
If we're gonna do
this thing,

1207
01:12:00,050 --> 01:12:01,600
then we're gonna
have to work together.

1208
01:12:01,780 --> 01:12:02,898
It would violate the vow.

1209
01:12:02,962 --> 01:12:05,882
Your vow versus
the future of mankind.

1210
01:12:06,510 --> 01:12:08,397
I don't think there's much
of a choice in that.

1211
01:12:10,405 --> 01:12:13,171
The staff lies with Noah.
He was buried with it.

1212
01:12:13,278 --> 01:12:15,813
And where did the order
move Noah's body?

1213
01:12:17,842 --> 01:12:18,749
Tell me!

1214
01:12:19,186 --> 01:12:22,062
I am a member of the order.
You have to tell me, right?

1215
01:12:23,390 --> 01:12:24,554
You must swear to me.

1216
01:12:25,639 --> 01:12:28,040
If I help you,
you must promise to keep

1217
01:12:28,065 --> 01:12:30,062
and protect the secret
as if the original vow

1218
01:12:30,087 --> 01:12:31,588
was yours and yours alone.

1219
01:12:31,798 --> 01:12:33,874
No. You must not allow the world
to know what you have learned.

1220
01:12:33,907 --> 01:12:35,718
No, I'm a scientist.
The knowledge of...

1221
01:12:35,743 --> 01:12:36,943
You must promise!

1222
01:12:37,359 --> 01:12:39,374
Some things are more
valuable than knowledge.

1223
01:12:39,399 --> 01:12:40,866
Such as?
Faith.

1224
01:12:41,127 --> 01:12:44,999
To reveal what you have discovered would be
to rob those who believe of their faith.

1225
01:12:45,405 --> 01:12:46,812
And that's not for any man.

1226
01:12:48,420 --> 01:12:51,116
You swear to me this vow,
I will help you.

1227
01:12:51,736 --> 01:12:52,796
I will take you
to the staff.

1228
01:12:52,821 --> 01:12:55,132
He's fading... we need to do
something for him!

1229
01:12:59,195 --> 01:13:01,749
If I make this promise to you,
will you make one to me?

1230
01:13:02,360 --> 01:13:03,429
What do you ask?

1231
01:13:04,043 --> 01:13:05,804
One of our men
is badly injured.

1232
01:13:05,829 --> 01:13:06,991
He needs a doctor.

1233
01:13:08,869 --> 01:13:10,780
I will keep
this secret for you

1234
01:13:11,447 --> 01:13:13,348
If you inform your pilot

1235
01:13:13,634 --> 01:13:16,023
to get my man
to medical attention.

1236
01:13:17,195 --> 01:13:19,463
You'll risk the future
of the world for one man?

1237
01:13:19,740 --> 01:13:22,640
Two minutes ago you weren't even
willing to give us the truth.

1238
01:13:22,758 --> 01:13:23,835
I think it's fair.

1239
01:13:24,574 --> 01:13:26,468
His life for your secret.

1240
01:13:29,208 --> 01:13:29,952
Very well.

1241
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:32,812
My pilot will take
your man to the hospital.

1242
01:13:33,209 --> 01:13:34,866
And your secret
will be safe.

1243
01:13:44,503 --> 01:13:45,913
Unh!

1244
01:13:46,691 --> 01:13:48,726
Hang in there, Russell,
okay, you're gonna make it.

1245
01:13:48,965 --> 01:13:49,898
I'm gonna die,
aren't I?

1246
01:13:49,923 --> 01:13:52,507
No, no, you'd
annoy god too much.

1247
01:13:53,041 --> 01:13:54,734
Joanna, I want you
to go with him.

1248
01:13:54,759 --> 01:13:57,027
Make sure he gets
the best medical attention.

1249
01:13:57,129 --> 01:13:58,359
All right, we will be
okay without you.

1250
01:13:58,384 --> 01:14:00,749
No, no, I want to see
this thing through.

1251
01:14:01,025 --> 01:14:03,187
Russell needs you more
than we do right now,

1252
01:14:03,212 --> 01:14:05,968
and I do not want another one
of my students getting hurt.

1253
01:14:06,038 --> 01:14:08,940
Please do as I say
and go with him.

1254
01:14:09,117 --> 01:14:11,320
Okay, okay,
but be careful.

1255
01:14:11,345 --> 01:14:12,984
I will.
Now go, go!

1256
01:14:13,445 --> 01:14:14,890
Doc!
Yeah, buddy?

1257
01:14:14,915 --> 01:14:16,468
Kill that son of a bitch.

1258
01:14:16,493 --> 01:14:18,265
Will do.
Go!

1259
01:14:32,788 --> 01:14:35,289
Some biblical historians
believe that Noah

1260
01:14:35,322 --> 01:14:37,702
was buried in the graveyard
of the kings

1261
01:14:37,734 --> 01:14:39,101
on the island of Bahrain.

1262
01:14:39,242 --> 01:14:40,312
Which is exactly
what the order

1263
01:14:40,337 --> 01:14:41,288
wants you to think.

1264
01:14:41,487 --> 01:14:43,262
I told you, the order
spent 5,000 years

1265
01:14:43,294 --> 01:14:44,733
hiding the truth
about Noah.

1266
01:14:45,010 --> 01:14:46,140
Even the church?

1267
01:14:46,253 --> 01:14:48,585
The church has become somewhat
reluctant conspirators,

1268
01:14:48,716 --> 01:14:50,650
And even they don't know
the entire truth.

1269
01:14:50,835 --> 01:14:53,062
We've got to great lengths,
Dr. Zavatterro.

1270
01:14:53,180 --> 01:14:56,188
Nothing's left for chance
and nothing's an accident.

1271
01:14:56,441 --> 01:14:58,655
Why did you move
Noah's body?

1272
01:14:58,796 --> 01:15:01,226
The ancient city was built
by the Noachidae.

1273
01:15:01,335 --> 01:15:03,607
The order moved Noah's body
to protect it.

1274
01:15:04,185 --> 01:15:06,252
The creature was
once banished by Noah.

1275
01:15:06,422 --> 01:15:08,657
It will seek out the staff
and will destroy it.

1276
01:15:09,114 --> 01:15:10,804
We're coming up
on Al Bajib.

1277
01:15:11,451 --> 01:15:14,019
There was an Iraqi army
platoon stationed there,

1278
01:15:14,044 --> 01:15:16,701
but if they bugged out and the
insurgents have taken control,

1279
01:15:16,855 --> 01:15:18,773
I expect everyone here
to keep their heads up.

1280
01:15:47,754 --> 01:15:48,882
Captain Bahar.

1281
01:15:48,942 --> 01:15:51,734
We've been having insurgent
problems for the last three days.

1282
01:15:51,759 --> 01:15:53,601
Hutch, take the APC

1283
01:15:53,626 --> 01:15:54,820
and block off
the end of the road.

1284
01:15:54,845 --> 01:15:55,616
Yes, sir.

1285
01:15:56,558 --> 01:15:57,825
I'll be with you
in a minute.

1286
01:15:58,440 --> 01:15:59,469
Keep your eyes open.

1287
01:15:59,598 --> 01:16:01,335
Corporal,
get my flank.

1288
01:16:17,223 --> 01:16:19,077
Corporal, stand guard.

1289
01:16:19,397 --> 01:16:20,757
You won't be
needing that in here.

1290
01:16:20,988 --> 01:16:22,374
You're not getting
my gun.

1291
01:16:22,602 --> 01:16:23,835
This is
a house of god.

1292
01:16:23,973 --> 01:16:24,734
You got them fooled,

1293
01:16:25,993 --> 01:16:26,710
but not me.

1294
01:16:29,575 --> 01:16:30,452
Very well.

1295
01:16:35,617 --> 01:16:37,304
We must hurry.
The crypt is beneath the altar.

1296
01:16:37,882 --> 01:16:39,046
Sister, please, please.

1297
01:16:45,914 --> 01:16:46,913
Give me a hand.

1298
01:16:47,519 --> 01:16:49,499
No, this is...
this is all wrong.

1299
01:16:49,909 --> 01:16:51,443
The markings,
the frescoes.

1300
01:16:51,658 --> 01:16:53,392
This is a crusader's tomb.

1301
01:16:53,914 --> 01:16:55,718
A little farther east
than I would've expected,

1302
01:16:55,743 --> 01:16:58,846
but the tomb of a knight
of the crusades nonetheless.

1303
01:16:58,871 --> 01:16:59,971
Things are not
what they seem.

1304
01:17:00,325 --> 01:17:01,945
Are you saying that Noah
is buried here?

1305
01:17:01,970 --> 01:17:03,687
And the staff
is buried with him.

1306
01:17:03,712 --> 01:17:05,749
You better be right
about this.

1307
01:17:05,774 --> 01:17:07,207
Come on, move over.

1308
01:17:07,232 --> 01:17:09,133
Come on, put some
weight into it!

1309
01:17:11,831 --> 01:17:13,566
a little more.

1310
01:17:25,158 --> 01:17:27,671
This can't be. 
It's dirt?

1311
01:17:27,837 --> 01:17:31,201
We wasted our time looking
for your magic stick, professor

1312
01:17:31,226 --> 01:17:34,460
and this guy led us To
a box full of dirt?!

1313
01:17:34,485 --> 01:17:35,718
No, it's here,
I know it's here.

1314
01:17:35,743 --> 01:17:37,943
How would you know that?
I know, I believe it.

1315
01:17:37,968 --> 01:17:40,337
Nicholas, how...
Ava, I believe.

1316
01:17:41,082 --> 01:17:42,415
I believe it!

1317
01:17:51,485 --> 01:17:55,688
aah!

1318
01:18:13,805 --> 01:18:15,672
You hold him off.
I'll warn the Major.

1319
01:18:15,697 --> 01:18:16,597
Good!

1320
01:18:22,481 --> 01:18:25,349
Aah!

1321
01:18:52,254 --> 01:18:53,265
You had faith
when I did not.

1322
01:18:54,161 --> 01:18:55,905
Major, I just saw it.

1323
01:18:56,088 --> 01:18:57,722
Let's go get it.

1324
01:19:12,285 --> 01:19:13,616
What was that thing?

1325
01:19:13,813 --> 01:19:14,663
Long story.

1326
01:19:14,947 --> 01:19:16,827
We'll destroy it, but we're
gonna need your help.

1327
01:19:17,025 --> 01:19:17,788
We're with you.

1328
01:19:17,938 --> 01:19:20,430
But the monster is gone.

1329
01:19:20,688 --> 01:19:22,007
No, no, it'll come back.

1330
01:19:22,032 --> 01:19:24,007
It'll come back and kill
everyone here.

1331
01:19:24,348 --> 01:19:27,898
We gotta figure out a way to destroy
this thing once and for all.

1332
01:19:28,724 --> 01:19:30,195
Now how does this work?
What do we have to do?

1333
01:19:30,363 --> 01:19:32,103
The staff has to be
in the hands of a man

1334
01:19:32,128 --> 01:19:33,992
With faith and righteousness
for it to work.

1335
01:19:34,155 --> 01:19:35,326
All right,
so you'll hold it.

1336
01:19:35,351 --> 01:19:37,252
No, I doubted my faith.
You did not.

1337
01:19:37,437 --> 01:19:38,491
You must be the one.

1338
01:19:39,291 --> 01:19:41,054
He's right... you're
the only one who believed.

1339
01:19:45,015 --> 01:19:47,197
All right, then we've
gotta figure out a way

1340
01:19:47,222 --> 01:19:48,609
to flush this thing
towards me.

1341
01:19:48,634 --> 01:19:49,609
I got an idea.

1342
01:19:50,013 --> 01:19:51,481
How many grenades
do you got left?

1343
01:19:51,506 --> 01:19:52,476
What are you thinking,
Major?

1344
01:19:52,501 --> 01:19:54,452
We'll rig explosions
all around the village.

1345
01:19:54,574 --> 01:19:56,015
We'll be the bait
to lure it out.

1346
01:19:56,403 --> 01:19:58,366
We'll draw it to the
intersection towards doc.

1347
01:19:58,679 --> 01:19:59,624
There's just one problem.

1348
01:19:59,929 --> 01:20:01,710
What's that? 
We don't have enough explosives.

1349
01:20:01,735 --> 01:20:03,135
But we do.

1350
01:20:03,160 --> 01:20:05,452
We've got explosives
and grenades in our barracks.

1351
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:06,210
Good.

1352
01:20:06,407 --> 01:20:08,241
I need your men to get
the people out of the village.

1353
01:20:08,367 --> 01:20:09,687
Get them to a safe distance.

1354
01:20:09,911 --> 01:20:12,335
Doc, we'll be back
when we're ready for you.

1355
01:20:12,562 --> 01:20:13,390
Let's go!

1356
01:20:32,925 --> 01:20:33,727
Nicholas...

1357
01:20:35,159 --> 01:20:36,554
When we were at the ruins,

1358
01:20:37,059 --> 01:20:38,626
I asked you
what happened to you.

1359
01:20:39,506 --> 01:20:40,859
You said that
I wouldn't understand.

1360
01:20:43,671 --> 01:20:44,718
What happened to you?

1361
01:20:45,853 --> 01:20:49,008
The chamber was collapsing
all around me.

1362
01:20:50,671 --> 01:20:51,679
And I knew

1363
01:20:52,345 --> 01:20:54,421
I wasn't gonna 
make it out alive.

1364
01:20:56,568 --> 01:20:58,468
So I closed my eyes...

1365
01:21:00,137 --> 01:21:02,124
And I asked god
to let me live.

1366
01:21:06,488 --> 01:21:07,476
And he did.

1367
01:21:09,325 --> 01:21:12,507
I should've been crushed,
but I wasn't.

1368
01:21:13,899 --> 01:21:16,351
And I can't find
another way to explain it.

1369
01:21:17,086 --> 01:21:18,754
There is only one way.

1370
01:21:19,438 --> 01:21:20,241
There is.

1371
01:21:28,775 --> 01:21:30,296
All right,
let's get to work.

1372
01:21:30,685 --> 01:21:31,752
We're gonna need
that cage.

1373
01:21:31,889 --> 01:21:33,054
It will be taken
care of.

1374
01:21:43,360 --> 01:21:44,727
It is ready.

1375
01:21:45,740 --> 01:21:46,807
Very good.

1376
01:21:50,831 --> 01:21:51,710
You okay?

1377
01:21:52,311 --> 01:21:53,241
I'm scared.

1378
01:21:53,836 --> 01:21:55,413
What if this
doesn't work?

1379
01:21:56,102 --> 01:21:57,186
It'll work.

1380
01:21:57,788 --> 01:21:59,155
You're telling me
to have faith?

1381
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:04,413
Yeah, I guess I am.

1382
01:22:06,132 --> 01:22:07,195
Be careful.

1383
01:22:14,414 --> 01:22:15,615
I will.

1384
01:22:16,807 --> 01:22:18,842
All right, let's do this.

1385
01:22:32,896 --> 01:22:34,937
Come on out,
kitty, kitty!

1386
01:22:36,532 --> 01:22:38,433
Kitty?

1387
01:22:38,720 --> 01:22:39,687
Kitty, kitty.

1388
01:22:42,987 --> 01:22:44,421
Come to big daddy.

1389
01:22:44,600 --> 01:22:46,301
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1390
01:22:46,477 --> 01:22:48,398
I just want to rub you.

1391
01:22:55,472 --> 01:22:56,593
My gun's jammed!

1392
01:22:56,618 --> 01:22:58,734
Major, I've got him!

1393
01:23:01,348 --> 01:23:02,682
Aah!

1394
01:23:05,923 --> 01:23:08,391
Aah!

1395
01:23:11,158 --> 01:23:12,640
Come on and get me!

1396
01:23:31,538 --> 01:23:33,005
It isn't working.
It's gonna kill 'em!

1397
01:23:39,090 --> 01:23:40,958
Do it!
Nicholas!

1398
01:23:41,385 --> 01:23:43,186
Unh!

1399
01:23:53,335 --> 01:23:54,869
Oh, my god.

1400
01:23:57,447 --> 01:24:00,294
It's not... it's not working.
What haven't we done?

1401
01:24:00,319 --> 01:24:02,020
Pierce its heart!

1402
01:24:03,216 --> 01:24:04,286
I don't know if I can.

1403
01:24:04,311 --> 01:24:06,888
You can, Nicholas,
you can, just believe it!

1404
01:24:12,060 --> 01:24:13,961
I need that crate!

1405
01:24:20,301 --> 01:24:22,059
Hurry! Hurry!

1406
01:24:22,084 --> 01:24:23,849
I can't hold on
much longer!

1407
01:24:25,705 --> 01:24:27,506
I can't hold on!

1408
01:24:39,752 --> 01:24:40,952
Now!

1409
01:24:43,409 --> 01:24:44,560
Lock it!

1410
01:25:11,904 --> 01:25:14,474
There are still many
secrets to protect.

1411
01:25:15,119 --> 01:25:18,482
Things that if revealed would shake
The very foundation of belief.

1412
01:25:21,491 --> 01:25:23,021
You have done well.

1413
01:25:23,605 --> 01:25:26,274
You all
have done well.

1414
01:25:26,615 --> 01:25:29,417
And I trust that this
will remain between us.

1415
01:25:30,328 --> 01:25:31,966
I'm sure you may
want this back.

1416
01:25:33,098 --> 01:25:34,739
You've earned the right
to carry it.

1417
01:25:35,582 --> 01:25:37,966
Come.
We have much to discuss.

1418
01:25:40,982 --> 01:25:41,638
So... 

1419
01:25:42,618 --> 01:25:44,786
What other little treasures
are you guys hiding?

1420
01:25:45,716 --> 01:25:47,021
All in good time.

1421
01:25:54,015 --> 01:25:55,239
Where will it go?

1422
01:25:56,199 --> 01:25:57,435
Someplace safe.

1423
01:25:58,682 --> 01:26:00,763
It's time.
We must go.

1424
01:26:01,221 --> 01:26:02,263
I'll be right with you.

1425
01:26:04,782 --> 01:26:07,552
Well, doc,
it was nice knowing you.

1428
01:26:10,280 --> 01:26:11,325
Yeah, I think so.

1429
01:26:12,420 --> 01:26:13,450
Thank you, Major.

1430
01:26:14,199 --> 01:26:15,959

my ass out there.

1431
01:26:16,232 --> 01:26:17,489

01:26:21,941 --> 01:26:23,224
She's still into you.
