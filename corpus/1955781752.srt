After decimating the

the Supreme Leader Snoke

10

his group of

Luke Skywalker will return

and restore the spark

But the Resistance
has been exposed.

and annihilate that fleet.

This is General Hux
of the First Order.

51
00:03:42,232 --> 00:03:44,154
The Republic is no more.

52
00:03:44,371 --> 00:03:47,523
Your fleet are rebel
scum and war criminals.

53
00:03:47,814 --> 00:03:50,000
Tell your princess there
will be no terms...

54
00:03:50,395 --> 00:03:52,741
there will be no surrender.

You and your friends are doomed!

58
00:03:59,347 --> 00:04:02,142
We will wipe your filth

00:04:03,212 --> 00:04:05,004
<i>Okay. I wilt.</i>

60
00:04:05,951 --> 00:04:06,951
<i>Hello?</i>

61
00:04:07,341 --> 00:04:09,771
Hello? Yup. I'm still here.

62
00:04:10,552 --> 00:04:11,943
Can you, can you hear me?

63
00:04:12,355 --> 00:04:13,494
<i>- Hux?
- Perhaps.</i>

64
00:04:13,756 --> 00:04:15,534
<i>An "H". Creepy guys.</i>

65
00:04:15,717 --> 00:04:16,850
<i>A little messy.</i>

66
00:04:17,423 --> 00:04:20,219
I can't hear you.
Can you hear me?

67
00:04:20,557 --> 00:04:22,471
Look, I cannot wait forever.
If you reach him...

68
00:04:22,495 --> 00:04:25,274
Tell him, Leia has an
urgent message for him.

69
00:04:25,615 --> 00:04:27,682
I think he is too crazy, sir.

70
00:04:28,047 --> 00:04:29,631
<i>About his mother.</i>

71
00:04:30,128 --> 00:04:31,505
Open fire!

72
00:04:32,207 --> 00:04:33,207
BB-8, punch it!

73
00:04:43,007 --> 00:04:44,340
Goes for the dreadnought.

74
00:04:46,058 --> 00:04:47,078
He's insane.

75
00:04:49,386 --> 00:04:51,109
<i>Yuhuu! I got it kid.</i>

76
00:05:04,974 --> 00:05:07,182
All right, now I
destroy the cannons.

77
00:05:07,414 --> 00:05:08,604
<i>Tallie, start getting close.</i>

78
00:05:08,628 --> 00:05:09,628
<i>Copy that.</i>

79
00:05:11,081 --> 00:05:13,936
Captain Canady, why is not that flimsy
ship being riddled with bullets?

80
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:16,825
That flimsy ship is very
small and very close.

81
00:05:17,088 --> 00:05:18,357
We must launch our fighters...

82
00:05:18,935 --> 00:05:20,454
Five fucking minutes ago.

83
00:05:20,817 --> 00:05:22,100
It will never
penetrate our armor.

84
00:05:22,124 --> 00:05:23,720
It does not try to
penetrate our armor.

85
00:05:24,117 --> 00:05:25,941
It is eliminating our
surface cannons.

86
00:05:28,377 --> 00:05:29,458
<i>There is a cannon left.</i>

87
00:05:29,796 --> 00:05:30,994
<i>And here comes the parade.</i>

88
00:05:36,694 --> 00:05:37,694
<i>Yes! Yes, I see it!</i>

89
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:44,720
<i>No no. Dammit!</i>

90
00:05:44,956 --> 00:05:46,167
BB-8, my weapons do not work.

91
00:05:46,477 --> 00:05:47,703
We will eliminate
that last cannon...

92
00:05:47,727 --> 00:05:48,928
or the bombers are fried.

93
00:05:48,952 --> 00:05:50,260
Make your magic work, partner.

94
00:06:05,666 --> 00:06:07,093
Are auto-guns ready?

95
00:06:07,323 --> 00:06:08,454
Ready and ready, sir.

96
00:06:08,478 --> 00:06:09,567
What are we waiting for?

97
00:06:10,015 --> 00:06:11,015
Shoot the base!

98
00:06:15,807 --> 00:06:16,807
Go ahead!

99
00:06:25,212 --> 00:06:26,957
<i>Last transport in flight.
Evacuation list.</i>

100
00:06:27,987 --> 00:06:29,075
You did it, Poe.

101
00:06:29,371 --> 00:06:32,467
Now bring your squad
so we can leave here.

102
00:06:32,735 --> 00:06:33,806
No, General...

103
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:35,488
<i>We can not do it. We can't...</i>

104
00:06:35,512 --> 00:06:36,512
knock down a dreadnought.

105
00:06:40,976 --> 00:06:42,278
<i>Those things are
fleet assassins.</i>

106
00:06:42,302 --> 00:06:43,386
<i>We can not let it escape.</i>

107
00:06:43,410 --> 00:06:44,439
Retire now...

108
00:06:44,773 --> 00:06:46,040
<i>Commander. That's an order...</i>

109
00:06:46,380 --> 00:06:47,540
Commander. That's an order...

110
00:06:53,234 --> 00:06:56,093
Clear that nervous expression
on your face, C-3PO.

111
00:06:56,847 --> 00:06:59,421
I'll try, General.

112
00:06:59,609 --> 00:07:00,719
Nervous?

113
00:07:03,612 --> 00:07:04,823
Come on, BB-8.

114
00:07:05,024 --> 00:07:06,024
Now or never!

115
00:07:29,597 --> 00:07:31,657
<i>Yes!</i>

116
00:07:33,538 --> 00:07:35,211
Clear! Bring the pumps.

117
00:07:35,495 --> 00:07:36,495
Captain...

118
00:07:36,938 --> 00:07:38,698
The Resistance bombers
are approaching.

119
00:07:39,181 --> 00:07:40,472
Of course.

120
00:07:53,131 --> 00:07:54,621
<i>Bombers, keep that formation.</i>

121
00:07:54,645 --> 00:07:56,610
<i>Fighters, protect the bombers.</i>

122
00:07:56,841 --> 00:07:59,339
<i>We can not always give a
dreadnught, it's worth it.</i>

123
00:07:59,580 --> 00:08:00,580
<i>Understood, Blue Leader.</i>

124
00:08:00,752 --> 00:08:02,549
<i>If you take us there,
we will shoot them.</i>

125
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,455
<i>- Copy that.
- Fighters coming.</i>

126
00:08:06,786 --> 00:08:08,195
<i>Gunners, move faster.</i>

127
00:08:10,405 --> 00:08:11,417
<i>Snub hunts at 2-10!</i>

128
00:08:11,693 --> 00:08:12,706
<i>- Are getting closer!
- Form yourself!</i>

129
00:08:12,730 --> 00:08:14,139
<i>They are everywhere!</i>

130
00:08:14,631 --> 00:08:16,491
<i>- Here they come.
- Fighters arrive. Form yourself.</i>

131
00:08:16,515 --> 00:08:17,921
<i>Vector at attack speed.</i>

132
00:08:18,142 --> 00:08:19,736
<i>- Stand up!
- Right side.</i>

133
00:08:21,068 --> 00:08:23,412
<i>Help! We collapsed!</i>

134
00:08:24,094 --> 00:08:26,065
Recharge the auto-guns.

135
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:28,197
Point to that cruise.

136
00:08:33,884 --> 00:08:35,767
I see. Tallie, they have
targeted the fleet...

137
00:08:36,052 --> 00:08:37,555
<i>And the preparation
sequence began.</i>

138
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:38,870
<i>It is understood.</i>

139
00:08:39,042 --> 00:08:40,042
<i>We are almost there.</i>

140
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:42,357
<i>Bombers...</i>

141
00:08:42,622 --> 00:08:44,338
<i>Start counting to
throw the bombs.</i>

142
00:08:50,739 --> 00:08:52,246
<i>I have eye contact
with the target.</i>

143
00:08:52,557 --> 00:08:54,768
<i>We are approaching
the point of attack.</i>

144
00:08:57,125 --> 00:08:58,979
<i>The pumps are armed.</i>

145
00:09:21,651 --> 00:09:22,443
Auto-guns pointing.

146
00:09:22,656 --> 00:09:24,163
Subtract 40 seconds
for full load.

147
00:09:24,375 --> 00:09:26,599
Destroy that last bomber!

148
00:09:31,764 --> 00:09:34,364
Paige, come on. We are
on the objective.

149
00:09:34,572 --> 00:09:35,629
Open the floodgates.

150
00:09:35,869 --> 00:09:38,059
It is the only bomber that remains.
All up to you!

151
00:09:47,316 --> 00:09:48,654
<i>- Nix!
- Paige!</i>

152
00:09:48,900 --> 00:09:50,666
Now throw the explosives!

153
00:10:00,088 --> 00:10:01,088
Watch out!

154
00:10:02,866 --> 00:10:03,866
Do not!

155
00:11:01,657 --> 00:11:02,657
<i>Get out bombs!</i>

156
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:31,060
Direct impact!

157
00:11:31,185 --> 00:11:32,185
Dreadnought knocked down!

158
00:12:06,443 --> 00:12:07,850
General, Supreme Leader Snoke...

159
00:12:07,874 --> 00:12:09,911
is making contact
from your ship.

160
00:12:11,697 --> 00:12:12,697
Excellent.

161
00:12:13,689 --> 00:12:16,266
I will attend you in my room.

162
00:12:17,064 --> 00:12:19,338
<i>General Hux.</i>

163
00:12:20,664 --> 00:12:22,392
<i>All right. Supreme leader.</i>

164
00:12:26,319 --> 00:12:27,510
<i>My disappointment...</i>

165
00:12:27,788 --> 00:12:31,928
<i>by its performance can
not be exaggerated.</i>

166
00:12:32,262 --> 00:12:34,349
You can not escape,
Supreme Leader.

167
00:12:35,496 --> 00:12:38,792
We have them tied to a rope.

168
00:12:49,651 --> 00:12:50,725
King!

169
00:13:07,237 --> 00:13:08,464
Well done, friend.

170
00:13:12,326 --> 00:13:15,255
"Finn dripping bag"? What?
Did you burn a chip?

171
00:13:22,675 --> 00:13:24,223
Finn! Finn. Companion.

172
00:13:25,315 --> 00:13:26,505
Good to see you.

173
00:13:26,734 --> 00:13:27,734
What? Come on...

174
00:13:27,924 --> 00:13:30,811
We have to dress you. Come on.

175
00:13:31,121 --> 00:13:32,311
You must have my questions.

176
00:13:32,536 --> 00:13:33,694
Where is Rey?

177
00:14:36,124 --> 00:14:37,699
Master Skywalker?

178
00:15:01,458 --> 00:15:03,327
Master Skywalker?

179
00:15:05,023 --> 00:15:06,528
I'm from the Resistance.

180
00:15:06,818 --> 00:15:09,664
My sister Leia sent me.
We need your help.

181
00:15:18,362 --> 00:15:19,964
Hello?

182
00:15:51,077 --> 00:15:52,364
Go away.

183
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:00,510
Chewie, what are you doing here?

184
00:16:01,477 --> 00:16:02,706
He said to come back with us.

185
00:16:02,963 --> 00:16:03,963
How did you find me?

186
00:16:04,115 --> 00:16:05,705
We'll tell you the
story in the Falcon.

187
00:16:06,939 --> 00:16:08,110
<i>Hawk?</i>

188
00:16:10,862 --> 00:16:12,226
Wait.

189
00:16:15,549 --> 00:16:17,550
Where is Han?

190
00:16:22,642 --> 00:16:26,390
In effect, tied to a rope, General Hux.
Well done.

191
00:16:26,617 --> 00:16:29,665
The Resistance will
soon be in our hands.

192
00:16:29,960 --> 00:16:32,061
Thank you, Supreme Leader.

193
00:16:39,661 --> 00:16:42,344
You wonder why I
have a rabid dog?

194
00:16:42,653 --> 00:16:45,851
In a place of so much power?

195
00:16:46,107 --> 00:16:49,820
The weakness of a
well-manipulated dog...

196
00:16:50,007 --> 00:16:53,577
It can be a sharp instrument.

197
00:16:55,859 --> 00:16:57,359
How is your wound?

198
00:16:58,668 --> 00:16:59,814
<i>Is nothing.</i>

199
00:17:03,334 --> 00:17:06,827
The powerful Kylo Ren.

200
00:17:07,749 --> 00:17:09,382
When I found you...

201
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:14,036
I saw what every
teacher dreams to see.

202
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:18,035
A pure and wild power.

203
00:17:18,277 --> 00:17:23,639
And beyond that,
something truly special.

204
00:17:24,383 --> 00:17:26,806
The potential of your lineage.

205
00:17:27,872 --> 00:17:32,098
A new Vader.

206
00:17:37,868 --> 00:17:40,239
Now I'm afraid...

207
00:17:42,033 --> 00:17:44,524
That I was wrong.

208
00:17:46,893 --> 00:17:49,227
<i>Everything I have,
I gave it to you.</i>

209
00:17:50,385 --> 00:17:51,664
<i>To the dark side.</i>

210
00:17:51,901 --> 00:17:54,740
Take off that ridiculousness.

211
00:18:03,845 --> 00:18:07,543
Yes, there it is.

212
00:18:09,005 --> 00:18:13,413
In you there is too much of your
father's heart, young Solo.

213
00:18:13,676 --> 00:18:15,198
I killed Han Solo.

214
00:18:16,540 --> 00:18:18,228
When the time came,
I did not doubt it.

215
00:18:18,468 --> 00:18:23,379
And look at you, the feat
deeply hurt your spirit.

216
00:18:23,580 --> 00:18:25,962
You were unbalanced...

217
00:18:26,183 --> 00:18:29,606
Defeated by a girl who had
never held a Lightsaber!

218
00:18:30,016 --> 00:18:31,117
You failed!

219
00:18:34,493 --> 00:18:35,773
Skywalker is alive.

220
00:18:37,165 --> 00:18:41,560
The seed of the Jedi
Order is alive.

221
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,611
And while that happens...

222
00:18:43,944 --> 00:18:47,069
Hope lives in the galaxy.

223
00:18:47,355 --> 00:18:52,518
I thought you would be the
one to extinguish it.

224
00:18:53,757 --> 00:18:56,712
Oh me, you're not Vader.

225
00:18:57,919 --> 00:19:00,288
You are just a child...

226
00:19:02,255 --> 00:19:04,442
wearing a mask.

227
00:19:36,985 --> 00:19:38,014
Prepare my ship.

228
00:19:43,921 --> 00:19:46,365
There is no light
left in Kylo Ren.

229
00:19:46,604 --> 00:19:48,086
It is just getting stronger.

230
00:19:48,357 --> 00:19:52,060
The First Order will control
the main systems in weeks.

231
00:19:52,233 --> 00:19:54,099
We need your help.

232
00:19:54,309 --> 00:19:56,811
We need back to the Jedi Order.

233
00:19:59,309 --> 00:20:01,601
We need Luke Skywalker.

234
00:20:05,458 --> 00:20:08,081
They do not need Luke Skywalker.

235
00:20:08,991 --> 00:20:10,239
Did you hear something I said?

236
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:11,529
What do you think?

237
00:20:11,553 --> 00:20:16,090
What will I do with a lightsaber
to face the First Order?

238
00:20:17,215 --> 00:20:19,867
What did you think was
going to happen here?

239
00:20:20,102 --> 00:20:21,121
Do you think I came?

240
00:20:21,145 --> 00:20:25,219
To the farthest place in
the galaxy for nothing?

241
00:20:25,794 --> 00:20:27,162
Go away.

242
00:20:27,757 --> 00:20:29,510
I will not leave without you!

243
00:21:36,849 --> 00:21:37,903
Watch out!

244
00:22:13,756 --> 00:22:15,098
You are wasting your time.

245
00:23:32,060 --> 00:23:33,885
Who you are?

246
00:23:37,642 --> 00:23:39,683
I know this place.

247
00:23:45,477 --> 00:23:48,170
It was built a thousand
generations ago...

248
00:23:48,914 --> 00:23:51,198
to save this.

249
00:23:51,870 --> 00:23:54,493
The original Jedi texts.

250
00:23:56,848 --> 00:24:01,373
Like me, it's the last thing
left of the Jedi religion.

251
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,335
You saw this place.

252
00:24:06,532 --> 00:24:08,358
You saw this island.

253
00:24:08,944 --> 00:24:10,883
Only in dreams.

254
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:13,800
Who you are?

255
00:24:14,355 --> 00:24:15,395
He sent me the Resistance.

256
00:24:15,507 --> 00:24:16,652
Did they send you?

257
00:24:17,075 --> 00:24:18,992
What is special about you?

258
00:24:20,829 --> 00:24:22,771
- Where are you from?
- From nowhere.

259
00:24:23,366 --> 00:24:25,704
- Nobody is from nowhere.
- From Jakku.

260
00:24:25,924 --> 00:24:28,576
Well, that's the closest
thing to nowhere.

261
00:24:28,876 --> 00:24:31,412
Why are you here,
Rey, from nowhere?

262
00:24:31,670 --> 00:24:32,710
He sent me the Resistance.

263
00:24:33,874 --> 00:24:36,013
We need your help. The first
Order is unstoppable.

264
00:24:36,254 --> 00:24:38,754
Why are you here?

265
00:24:51,305 --> 00:24:54,640
There is something inside
me that was always there.

266
00:24:57,096 --> 00:24:58,834
But now he is awake.

267
00:25:00,805 --> 00:25:02,310
And I'm scared.

268
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:04,647
I do not know what it is...

269
00:25:05,264 --> 00:25:07,049
or what to do with that.

270
00:25:07,287 --> 00:25:08,664
And I need help.

271
00:25:09,431 --> 00:25:11,429
You need a teacher.

272
00:25:12,605 --> 00:25:13,623
I can not teach you.

273
00:25:14,533 --> 00:25:15,533
Why not?

274
00:25:16,922 --> 00:25:18,802
I saw your daily routine.
You're not occupated.

275
00:25:19,029 --> 00:25:22,593
I will never train
another Jedi generation.

276
00:25:23,166 --> 00:25:25,246
I came to die to this island.

277
00:25:26,957 --> 00:25:29,835
It's time for the
Jedi to finish.

278
00:25:30,849 --> 00:25:31,907
Why?

279
00:25:33,250 --> 00:25:35,543
Leia sent me here with hope.

280
00:25:35,852 --> 00:25:38,615
If she was wrong, she
deserves to know why.

281
00:25:39,749 --> 00:25:41,026
We all deserve it.

282
00:25:47,968 --> 00:25:53,893
<i>(Subtitled by cinabenglu5:)</i>

283
00:26:10,408 --> 00:26:11,408
You degrade.

284
00:26:11,558 --> 00:26:12,274
What? Wait!

285
00:26:12,550 --> 00:26:13,671
We demolished a dreadnought.

286
00:26:13,852 --> 00:26:14,852
At what cost?

287
00:26:14,959 --> 00:26:16,568
If you start an attack,
you finish it.

288
00:26:16,824 --> 00:26:18,246
Poe, stop thinking as a pilot.

289
00:26:18,545 --> 00:26:21,472
There are things
you can not solve!

290
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:24,458
Climbing an X-wing and
blowing something up!

291
00:26:24,782 --> 00:26:26,583
I need you to learn that.

292
00:26:27,723 --> 00:26:29,438
There were heroes
in that mission.

293
00:26:29,739 --> 00:26:31,054
Dead heroes.

294
00:26:31,904 --> 00:26:33,219
No leaders.

295
00:26:38,605 --> 00:26:40,579
We are far.

296
00:26:40,755 --> 00:26:42,403
How will Rey find us?

297
00:26:45,118 --> 00:26:46,406
A camouflaged binary beacon?

298
00:26:46,669 --> 00:26:47,947
To indicate your way home.

299
00:26:49,689 --> 00:26:51,602
Well, until she comes
back, what's the plan?

300
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:53,521
We need to find a new base.

301
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,861
One with power to send a
distress signal to our allies...

302
00:26:57,115 --> 00:26:58,553
scattered in the Outer Rim.

303
00:27:00,518 --> 00:27:02,222
Proximity alert!

304
00:27:02,568 --> 00:27:03,568
They found us.

305
00:27:03,736 --> 00:27:05,093
It is impossible.

306
00:27:17,497 --> 00:27:19,220
It's Snoke's ship.

307
00:27:19,523 --> 00:27:20,747
Can not be.

308
00:27:21,306 --> 00:27:22,306
Can we do the jump?

309
00:27:22,499 --> 00:27:23,986
We have fuel for a jump.

310
00:27:24,256 --> 00:27:25,614
Do it. We have to
get out of here.

311
00:27:25,638 --> 00:27:26,761
Wait.

312
00:27:28,051 --> 00:27:30,474
They tracked us while we were
going at the speed of light.

313
00:27:31,865 --> 00:27:32,865
That's impossible.

314
00:27:33,428 --> 00:27:34,428
Yes.

315
00:27:36,118 --> 00:27:37,671
And they did it.

316
00:27:38,533 --> 00:27:39,574
If we make another leap...

317
00:27:39,751 --> 00:27:41,824
they will find us, and
we will run out of fuel.

318
00:27:42,053 --> 00:27:43,100
They have us.

319
00:27:43,124 --> 00:27:44,656
Not yet, they do not have us.

320
00:27:45,524 --> 00:27:47,318
Permission to go on an
X-wing to fly something?

321
00:27:47,342 --> 00:27:48,578
Permission granted.

322
00:27:48,906 --> 00:27:50,323
Admiral, surround us!

323
00:27:50,516 --> 00:27:52,429
Reverse. Rotate the shields!

324
00:27:52,774 --> 00:27:55,833
To your posts! Move!

325
00:28:09,498 --> 00:28:10,498
Do what I do.

326
00:28:15,348 --> 00:28:17,717
<i>Green squadron to
launch position.</i>

327
00:28:18,051 --> 00:28:20,016
<i>Clear the launch traffic.</i>

328
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:25,666
Do not wait for me!
Get up and start!

329
00:28:25,940 --> 00:28:29,567
<i>Technicians, secure supplies
for launch conditions.</i>

330
00:29:00,267 --> 00:29:01,267
Move!

331
00:29:18,511 --> 00:29:19,641
Poe, are you okay?

332
00:29:20,044 --> 00:29:22,104
We have to get away from
the Star Destroyers.

333
00:29:22,403 --> 00:29:23,670
Is what?

334
00:29:23,951 --> 00:29:25,094
At full speed.

335
00:29:25,455 --> 00:29:29,024
The fighters will retreat if they
move away from the Star Destroyers.

336
00:29:29,173 --> 00:29:30,807
All the ships, at full power!

337
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:33,285
Concentrate rear shields.

338
00:30:31,021 --> 00:30:32,969
<i>Ren, the Resistance
is out of reach.</i>

339
00:30:33,177 --> 00:30:34,684
<i>We can not cover it
at this distance.</i>

340
00:30:34,864 --> 00:30:36,236
<i>Go back to the fleet.</i>

341
00:30:39,027 --> 00:30:41,341
What is the purpose of all this?

342
00:30:41,606 --> 00:30:44,877
If we can not blow up
three small cruises?

343
00:30:45,076 --> 00:30:47,007
They are faster
and lighter, sir.

344
00:30:47,262 --> 00:30:48,945
They can maintain
such a distance...

345
00:30:49,187 --> 00:30:51,287
that our guns do not
affect their shields.

346
00:30:51,920 --> 00:30:54,505
Well, continue with the bombing.

347
00:30:54,751 --> 00:30:57,108
At least let's remind them
that we're still here.

348
00:30:57,363 --> 00:30:58,363
Very well sir.

349
00:30:58,562 --> 00:31:01,922
They will not last long
consuming fuel like that.

350
00:31:02,197 --> 00:31:04,580
It's just a matter of time.

351
00:32:11,081 --> 00:32:13,023
Move! Make way! Make room!

352
00:32:13,260 --> 00:32:15,485
His vital signs are weak,
but he is struggling.

353
00:33:47,327 --> 00:33:48,327
Artoo?

354
00:33:49,509 --> 00:33:50,546
Artoo!

355
00:33:53,013 --> 00:33:54,013
Yes.

356
00:33:54,841 --> 00:33:55,933
Yes I know.

357
00:33:56,749 --> 00:33:58,949
Hey, it's a sacred island,
take care of your vocabulary.

358
00:34:01,264 --> 00:34:03,219
Old friend.

359
00:34:05,011 --> 00:34:06,863
I wish I could get
you to understand.

360
00:34:08,000 --> 00:34:09,784
But I will not return.

361
00:34:10,653 --> 00:34:13,809
Nothing can make
me change my mind.

362
00:34:18,199 --> 00:34:20,683
<i>Years ago, you served my
father in the Clone Wars.</i>

363
00:34:21,041 --> 00:34:23,602
<i>Now he begs you to help him in
his fight against the Empire.</i>

364
00:34:23,753 --> 00:34:25,787
<i>It hurts me not to be able
to say it in person...</i>

365
00:34:26,033 --> 00:34:27,230
That was a cheap trick.

366
00:34:27,684 --> 00:34:29,005
<i>But they are
attacking my ship...</i>

367
00:34:29,222 --> 00:34:31,650
<i>and I fear that my mission to
bring you to Alderaan failed.</i>

368
00:34:31,831 --> 00:34:33,731
<i>It is our most desperate hour.</i>

369
00:34:33,953 --> 00:34:35,319
<i>Help me, Obi-Wan Kenobi.</i>

370
00:34:36,541 --> 00:34:37,611
<i>You are my only hope.</i>

371
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:51,451
Tomorrow at dawn.

372
00:34:52,394 --> 00:34:53,584
Three lessons

373
00:34:53,861 --> 00:34:56,464
I will teach you the
customs of the Jedi...

374
00:34:57,096 --> 00:34:58,720
and why they should end.

375
00:35:08,934 --> 00:35:10,384
The General Organa...

376
00:35:11,226 --> 00:35:12,251
Read...

377
00:35:12,537 --> 00:35:15,100
He is unconscious
but do not worry.

378
00:35:16,596 --> 00:35:18,485
They are the only
good news I have.

379
00:35:19,223 --> 00:35:23,302
Admiral Ackbar... all
our leaders, died.

380
00:35:24,469 --> 00:35:26,284
Leia was the only
survivor on the bridge.

381
00:35:26,718 --> 00:35:27,751
Oh God!

382
00:35:28,076 --> 00:35:32,093
If I were here, I'd say save
your pain for after the battle.

383
00:35:33,326 --> 00:35:34,359
For that reason...

384
00:35:35,409 --> 00:35:39,100
The chain of command is clear
about who should take his place.

385
00:35:40,285 --> 00:35:41,855
Vice Admiral Holdo...

386
00:35:42,226 --> 00:35:43,871
of the Ninka cruise.

387
00:35:45,127 --> 00:35:46,559
Thanks, Commander.

388
00:35:52,837 --> 00:35:55,526
We are four thousand...
in three ships.

389
00:35:57,226 --> 00:35:59,704
We are the last remaining
of the Resistance.

390
00:36:01,752 --> 00:36:03,866
But we are not alone.

391
00:36:04,141 --> 00:36:06,184
In every corner of the galaxy...

392
00:36:06,452 --> 00:36:09,122
the enslaved and oppressed
know our symbol...

393
00:36:09,521 --> 00:36:11,205
and they put their hope in him.

394
00:36:12,019 --> 00:36:17,154
We are the spark that will ignite the
fire that will restore the Republic.

395
00:36:18,222 --> 00:36:19,618
That spark...

396
00:36:19,982 --> 00:36:22,670
this Resistance, must survive.

397
00:36:23,693 --> 00:36:25,798
That is our mission.

398
00:36:27,302 --> 00:36:28,474
Now, to your posts.

399
00:36:31,188 --> 00:36:33,165
And may the Force be with us.

400
00:36:38,826 --> 00:36:40,019
Is that Admiral Holdo?

401
00:36:41,068 --> 00:36:43,067
The same as the battle
of Chyron Belt?

402
00:36:46,430 --> 00:36:47,583
That's not what I expected.

403
00:36:48,983 --> 00:36:50,205
Vice Admiral?

404
00:36:50,426 --> 00:36:51,426
Commander Dameron.

405
00:36:51,528 --> 00:36:52,787
For the fuel consumption...

406
00:36:52,811 --> 00:36:54,273
for a very limited time...

407
00:36:54,438 --> 00:36:56,143
We will be out of
reach of your ships.

408
00:36:56,352 --> 00:36:58,561
You are very kind to inform me.

409
00:36:59,067 --> 00:37:00,298
Leave those calculations to me.

410
00:37:00,322 --> 00:37:02,522
And we need to lose them
before finding another base...

411
00:37:02,546 --> 00:37:03,815
What is our plan?

412
00:37:04,089 --> 00:37:05,729
Our plan, captain?

413
00:37:06,733 --> 00:37:08,307
No commander, right?

414
00:37:08,516 --> 00:37:10,585
Was not Deiarte the last
official act of Leia?

415
00:37:10,883 --> 00:37:12,284
Because of your
dreadnought plan...

416
00:37:12,949 --> 00:37:15,094
where we lost the entire
fleet of bombers?

417
00:37:18,631 --> 00:37:20,914
"Captain." "Commander." You
can call me as you want.

418
00:37:21,461 --> 00:37:22,993
I just want to
know what happens.

419
00:37:23,743 --> 00:37:24,783
Of course.

420
00:37:25,374 --> 00:37:26,374
I get it.

421
00:37:26,958 --> 00:37:29,723
I tried many intrepid
trigger triggers like you.

422
00:37:30,333 --> 00:37:31,333
You are impulsive.

423
00:37:33,207 --> 00:37:34,220
Dangerous.

424
00:37:35,643 --> 00:37:37,162
And the last thing we need.

425
00:37:38,264 --> 00:37:39,974
So stay at your post...

426
00:37:40,234 --> 00:37:42,082
and follow my orders.

427
00:37:55,153 --> 00:37:58,841
<i>Turbo-lifts seven and eight
disconnected for maintenance.</i>

428
00:38:32,327 --> 00:38:33,485
What are you doing here?

429
00:38:33,793 --> 00:38:35,049
Hi.

430
00:38:36,414 --> 00:38:39,400
I was... You know...
You are Finn!

431
00:38:40,489 --> 00:38:41,581
The unmatched Finn!

432
00:38:42,120 --> 00:38:43,773
- The unequaled Finn?
- I am sorry.

433
00:38:44,231 --> 00:38:45,738
I worked behind the
pipes all day.

434
00:38:46,229 --> 00:38:49,585
It is not my fort to give talk
to heroes of the Resistance.

435
00:38:50,846 --> 00:38:51,903
Give...

436
00:38:52,236 --> 00:38:53,236
give a talk.

437
00:38:54,463 --> 00:38:55,784
My name is Rose.

438
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,334
Breathe.

439
00:38:58,086 --> 00:38:59,527
- Good.
- Yes.

440
00:38:59,771 --> 00:39:01,595
Hey, I'm not a
Resistance hero, but...

441
00:39:01,807 --> 00:39:03,142
It was nice to chat with you.

442
00:39:06,568 --> 00:39:07,956
May the Force be with you.

443
00:39:09,174 --> 00:39:10,174
Go.

444
00:39:10,281 --> 00:39:11,318
You too.

445
00:39:12,857 --> 00:39:13,597
Good.

446
00:39:13,787 --> 00:39:15,662
But you are a hero.

447
00:39:16,453 --> 00:39:19,212
You left the First Order
of the Starkiller Base.

448
00:39:19,582 --> 00:39:20,869
My sister Paige said...

449
00:39:21,191 --> 00:39:22,525
"Rose, he's a true hero."

450
00:39:23,416 --> 00:39:24,505
"Difference good and bad."

451
00:39:24,529 --> 00:39:26,249
"And does not run away
when it's difficult."

452
00:39:26,599 --> 00:39:27,309
You know...

453
00:39:27,611 --> 00:39:29,116
this morning, I had to stop...

454
00:39:29,398 --> 00:39:30,816
three who were trying to
escape from the ship.

455
00:39:30,840 --> 00:39:31,796
In this escape pod.

456
00:39:31,820 --> 00:39:32,515
What?

457
00:39:32,779 --> 00:39:33,782
They were running away.

458
00:39:34,210 --> 00:39:35,210
That's embarrassing.

459
00:39:36,324 --> 00:39:37,369
I know.

460
00:39:40,428 --> 00:39:41,428
Anyway...

461
00:39:41,617 --> 00:39:43,183
I must continue with
what I was doing.

462
00:39:43,425 --> 00:39:44,517
What were you doing?

463
00:39:46,618 --> 00:39:48,566
- Checks.
- Checking the escape pods.

464
00:39:48,590 --> 00:39:49,317
No, routine checks.

465
00:39:49,493 --> 00:39:50,783
Approaching one...

466
00:39:52,560 --> 00:39:53,846
with a travel bag.

467
00:39:54,659 --> 00:39:55,659
It's okay.

468
00:39:55,821 --> 00:39:56,821
Listen, I...

469
00:40:10,502 --> 00:40:12,403
I can not move.

470
00:40:12,626 --> 00:40:14,340
I know - What happened?

471
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:16,360
I lock you up and give
you up as a deserter.

472
00:40:16,559 --> 00:40:17,559
I was not deserting.

473
00:40:17,835 --> 00:40:19,951
- I told you that...
- My sister just died...

474
00:40:20,224 --> 00:40:21,541
protecting the fleet.

475
00:40:21,973 --> 00:40:23,758
And you were running away.

476
00:40:24,921 --> 00:40:25,921
Sorry.

477
00:40:26,358 --> 00:40:27,436
This fleet is doomed...

478
00:40:27,460 --> 00:40:29,645
If my friend comes back
to her, she will be too.

479
00:40:30,037 --> 00:40:31,083
I must wear this...

480
00:40:32,582 --> 00:40:34,366
I must take this
beacon very far.

481
00:40:34,619 --> 00:40:36,139
That way she will
find me and be safe.

482
00:40:36,824 --> 00:40:38,645
You are a selfish traitor.

483
00:40:39,119 --> 00:40:40,968
We do not overtake the
fleet of the First Order.

484
00:40:40,992 --> 00:40:42,431
Let's jump at the
speed of light!

485
00:40:42,455 --> 00:40:43,455
They can track us.

486
00:40:44,272 --> 00:40:46,063
- Tracking at the speed of light?
- Yes.

487
00:40:46,310 --> 00:40:48,134
They would appear and
consume a lot of fuel.

488
00:40:48,347 --> 00:40:50,386
Of which, by the way, we
have very little left.

489
00:40:51,124 --> 00:40:52,909
- They track us at the speed of light.
- Yes.

490
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:54,119
And they could...

491
00:40:54,594 --> 00:40:55,594
I do not feel my tooth.

492
00:40:56,178 --> 00:40:57,446
What did you shoot me with?

493
00:40:57,702 --> 00:40:58,702
Active tracking.

494
00:40:58,865 --> 00:40:59,952
And now that?

495
00:41:00,547 --> 00:41:01,787
New hyperspace tracking...

496
00:41:01,811 --> 00:41:04,186
it must have the same principle
of every active tracker.

497
00:41:04,436 --> 00:41:06,069
- They're just tracking us...
- Yes...

498
00:41:06,093 --> 00:41:07,481
- of the main ship.
- Principal.

499
00:41:07,618 --> 00:41:09,078
But we can not
reach the tracker.

500
00:41:09,102 --> 00:41:11,103
It is a class A process
controlled from the bridge.

501
00:41:11,296 --> 00:41:12,460
But all Class A process...

502
00:41:12,732 --> 00:41:15,021
It has a dedicated switch.

503
00:41:15,591 --> 00:41:16,617
But...

504
00:41:16,641 --> 00:41:19,062
Who knows how to get to the
Star Destroyer substation?

505
00:41:21,367 --> 00:41:23,141
I'm the guy who
used to clean them.

506
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:24,831
If we can get there...

507
00:41:25,336 --> 00:41:27,335
I can turn off his tracker.

508
00:41:27,547 --> 00:41:29,518
Repeat it, but easier.

509
00:41:29,827 --> 00:41:32,967
The First Order only tracks us
from a Destroyer, the main one.

510
00:41:33,296 --> 00:41:34,507
So we make it explode?

511
00:41:34,531 --> 00:41:35,761
I like how you think, but no.

512
00:41:35,865 --> 00:41:37,586
We would be tracked
from another Destroyer.

513
00:41:37,705 --> 00:41:39,569
- But yes...
- If we sneak into the main...

514
00:41:39,810 --> 00:41:42,130
and we turn off the tracker
without you noticing, we can...

515
00:41:42,357 --> 00:41:44,352
You will not notice that
it is off by a cycle.

516
00:41:44,573 --> 00:41:45,952
About six minutes.

517
00:41:46,124 --> 00:41:47,124
Stand on board.

518
00:41:49,285 --> 00:41:50,576
Turn off the tracker.

519
00:41:52,182 --> 00:41:54,342
Our fleet escapes
before they realize it.

520
00:42:02,681 --> 00:42:03,791
How did you meet?

521
00:42:06,684 --> 00:42:07,684
A matter of luck.

522
00:42:09,315 --> 00:42:10,352
Yes?

523
00:42:10,701 --> 00:42:11,809
Good luck?

524
00:42:12,336 --> 00:42:13,418
I'm not sure yet.

525
00:42:13,954 --> 00:42:15,238
Poe, we have to do it.

526
00:42:15,441 --> 00:42:17,806
It will save the fleet and King.

527
00:42:19,423 --> 00:42:21,912
If I must be the only
voice of reason...

528
00:42:22,093 --> 00:42:24,075
Admiral Holdo will
not like this plan.

529
00:42:25,424 --> 00:42:27,819
Yes, you're right, C-3PO.

530
00:42:27,989 --> 00:42:29,389
Only those who need
it will know...

531
00:42:29,533 --> 00:42:30,533
and she will not know.

532
00:42:30,702 --> 00:42:32,263
- That was not exactly...
- All right...

533
00:42:32,460 --> 00:42:33,726
turn off the tracker.

534
00:42:34,029 --> 00:42:35,393
I will be here to make the jump.

535
00:42:35,605 --> 00:42:36,605
The question is...

536
00:42:36,760 --> 00:42:38,679
How do we put them on
the Snoke Destroyer?

537
00:42:38,909 --> 00:42:40,105
Stealing authorization codes.

538
00:42:40,129 --> 00:42:41,993
No, they are Bio-Hexaencripted
and decode them.

539
00:42:43,910 --> 00:42:46,373
We can not go through their
shields without being detected.

540
00:42:47,150 --> 00:42:48,312
Nobody can.

541
00:42:52,096 --> 00:42:53,435
<i>Could I do it?</i>

542
00:42:53,806 --> 00:42:54,806
<i>Of course I could.</i>

543
00:42:55,114 --> 00:42:56,114
<i>But I can not do it.</i>

544
00:42:56,319 --> 00:42:57,946
<i>Now I'm a little busy.</i>

545
00:42:59,203 --> 00:42:59,917
<i>Maz?</i>

546
00:43:00,199 --> 00:43:01,216
<i>What happens?</i>

547
00:43:01,461 --> 00:43:03,929
<i>A union conflict. They will
not want to know about it.</i>

548
00:43:04,865 --> 00:43:06,515
<i>But, luckily for you...</i>

549
00:43:06,772 --> 00:43:10,341
<i>There's a guy I trust who can
decipher something like that!</i>

550
00:43:12,901 --> 00:43:14,507
<i>He is a master decipherer...</i>

551
00:43:14,757 --> 00:43:15,757
<i>an expert pilot...</i>

552
00:43:16,177 --> 00:43:17,582
<i>a poet with a blaster.</i>

553
00:43:20,506 --> 00:43:21,200
Oh heavens.

554
00:43:21,469 --> 00:43:23,629
It seems that the deciphering
friend can do everything.

555
00:43:23,826 --> 00:43:26,184
<i>Oh yeah.</i>

556
00:43:27,719 --> 00:43:31,588
<i>You will find it with a red
ploom flower on its lapel...</i>

557
00:43:31,860 --> 00:43:34,242
<i>betting on high
betting tables...</i>

558
00:43:34,768 --> 00:43:36,891
<i>in the casino... in Canto Bight.</i>

559
00:43:36,915 --> 00:43:38,405
Can I sing Bight? No. That's...

560
00:43:38,957 --> 00:43:41,775
Maz... Can we take care of this?

561
00:43:42,018 --> 00:43:43,018
<i>I'm sorry, baby.</i>

562
00:43:43,285 --> 00:43:44,639
<i>It is de-encrypting sparse.</i>

563
00:43:45,221 --> 00:43:48,079
<i>If you want to go to that
Destroyer, I know only one option.</i>

564
00:43:48,617 --> 00:43:51,053
<i>Find the master decipherer.</i>

565
00:45:18,628 --> 00:45:20,993
You will bring me
Luke Skywalker.

566
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:29,312
You are not going to do it.
The effort could kill you.

567
00:45:34,317 --> 00:45:35,583
Can you see what surrounds me?

568
00:45:35,607 --> 00:45:37,127
You are going to pay
for what you did!

569
00:45:37,299 --> 00:45:38,620
I can not see what
is around you.

570
00:45:40,235 --> 00:45:41,285
Only you.

571
00:45:43,539 --> 00:45:44,893
So no.

572
00:45:46,602 --> 00:45:48,916
This is something else.

573
00:45:54,974 --> 00:45:55,974
Luke.

574
00:45:56,233 --> 00:45:57,922
What is it about?

575
00:46:12,394 --> 00:46:14,651
I cleaned my blaster.
It shot itself.

576
00:46:17,779 --> 00:46:18,851
Let us begin.

577
00:46:23,048 --> 00:46:24,392
Who were those things?

578
00:46:25,312 --> 00:46:26,542
Guardians.

579
00:46:26,805 --> 00:46:27,865
Natives of the island.

580
00:46:28,051 --> 00:46:30,322
They preserved the Jedi
structures from its construction.

581
00:46:31,111 --> 00:46:32,494
I do not think I like them.

582
00:46:32,875 --> 00:46:34,347
I can not imagine why.

583
00:47:10,164 --> 00:47:11,348
Master Skywalker...

584
00:47:11,964 --> 00:47:13,154
You have to bring the Jedi...

585
00:47:13,276 --> 00:47:15,934
because Kylo Ren is strong with
the dark side of the Force.

586
00:47:16,217 --> 00:47:18,488
Without the Jedi, we will not
have a chance against him.

587
00:47:18,780 --> 00:47:20,994
What do you know
about the Force?

588
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:24,366
It's a power of the Jedi that allows
them to control people and...

589
00:47:25,157 --> 00:47:26,559
make things float.

590
00:47:26,805 --> 00:47:27,505
Awesome.

591
00:47:27,773 --> 00:47:29,680
Every word in that
sentence was wrong.

592
00:47:30,234 --> 00:47:31,234
Lesson one...

593
00:47:31,258 --> 00:47:33,373
Sit here, with
your legs crossed.

594
00:47:40,224 --> 00:47:43,224
The Force is not any
power that you have.

595
00:47:43,511 --> 00:47:45,569
It is not about floating rocks.

596
00:47:46,089 --> 00:47:47,877
It is the energy
among all things...

597
00:47:48,117 --> 00:47:50,016
a tension, a balance...

598
00:47:50,314 --> 00:47:52,443
that links the entire universe.

599
00:47:52,719 --> 00:47:53,719
It's okay.

600
00:47:54,905 --> 00:47:55,905
But what is it?

601
00:47:57,480 --> 00:47:58,489
Close your eyes.

602
00:48:00,572 --> 00:48:01,884
Breathe.

603
00:48:02,822 --> 00:48:03,822
Now...

604
00:48:05,039 --> 00:48:06,127
stretch.

605
00:48:13,101 --> 00:48:13,884
I feel something.

606
00:48:14,094 --> 00:48:15,158
- You feel it?
- Yes.

607
00:48:15,182 --> 00:48:16,263
- It's the Force.
- Seriously?

608
00:48:16,287 --> 00:48:17,727
Oh, he must be very
strong with you.

609
00:48:17,878 --> 00:48:18,878
I never felt anything...

610
00:48:19,259 --> 00:48:20,259
Oh!

611
00:48:22,886 --> 00:48:24,173
You said to stretch me like...

612
00:48:26,716 --> 00:48:27,716
I'll try again.

613
00:48:30,114 --> 00:48:31,114
Breathe.

614
00:48:33,324 --> 00:48:35,180
Just breathe.

615
00:48:38,353 --> 00:48:40,425
Stretch with your feelings.

616
00:48:45,890 --> 00:48:47,024
Do you see?

617
00:48:51,344 --> 00:48:52,344
<i>The island.</i>

618
00:48:54,025 --> 00:48:55,025
<i>Lifetime.</i>

619
00:48:56,365 --> 00:48:57,658
<i>Death and decomposition...</i>

620
00:48:59,244 --> 00:49:00,554
<i>that feeds the new life.</i>

621
00:49:02,306 --> 00:49:03,306
<i>Hot.</i>

622
00:49:04,599 --> 00:49:05,599
<i>Cold.</i>

623
00:49:07,748 --> 00:49:08,960
<i>Peace.</i>

624
00:49:10,644 --> 00:49:11,846
<i>Violence.</i>

625
00:49:12,948 --> 00:49:14,358
And among all that?

626
00:49:15,241 --> 00:49:16,241
Balance.

627
00:49:16,988 --> 00:49:18,181
An energy.

628
00:49:21,357 --> 00:49:22,684
A force.

629
00:49:24,433 --> 00:49:25,929
And inside you?

630
00:49:27,205 --> 00:49:28,667
Inside of me...

631
00:49:29,973 --> 00:49:31,779
the same Force.

632
00:49:33,426 --> 00:49:36,029
And this is the lesson.

633
00:49:36,364 --> 00:49:39,427
The Force does not
belong to the Jedi.

634
00:49:40,735 --> 00:49:43,390
To say that if the Jedi die,
the light dies, it is vanity.

635
00:49:43,665 --> 00:49:45,623
Can you feel it?

636
00:49:47,497 --> 00:49:49,166
There is something more...

637
00:49:51,179 --> 00:49:52,472
under the island.

638
00:49:53,574 --> 00:49:54,574
A place.

639
00:49:55,847 --> 00:49:56,931
A dark place.

640
00:49:59,062 --> 00:50:00,132
Balance.

641
00:50:00,950 --> 00:50:02,655
Powerful light,
powerful darkness.

642
00:50:03,130 --> 00:50:04,130
It is cold.

643
00:50:09,921 --> 00:50:10,921
Calls me.

644
00:50:12,353 --> 00:50:13,353
Resist it, King.

645
00:50:14,514 --> 00:50:15,514
King?

646
00:50:18,381 --> 00:50:19,381
King!

647
00:50:27,952 --> 00:50:29,626
You went straight to darkness.

648
00:50:31,086 --> 00:50:32,779
That place was trying
to show me something.

649
00:50:32,803 --> 00:50:34,570
It offered you
something you needed.

650
00:50:35,193 --> 00:50:37,442
And you did not even
try to stop you.

651
00:50:38,698 --> 00:50:40,131
But I did not see you.

652
00:50:42,201 --> 00:50:43,770
Not at all.

653
00:50:47,302 --> 00:50:49,442
You prevented him from
accessing the Force.

654
00:50:53,134 --> 00:50:54,300
Of course.

655
00:50:55,787 --> 00:50:58,786
I saw this pure
force only once...

656
00:50:59,330 --> 00:51:01,008
in Ben Solo.

657
00:51:01,230 --> 00:51:02,856
At that time it did
not scare me enough.

658
00:51:04,127 --> 00:51:05,567
Yes now.

659
00:51:17,965 --> 00:51:18,965
What was that?

660
00:51:19,109 --> 00:51:20,109
Nothing, admiral.

661
00:51:20,432 --> 00:51:21,624
Debris that happened.

662
00:51:29,068 --> 00:51:30,853
The fleet has fuel
left for 18 hours.

663
00:51:31,282 --> 00:51:32,406
We have to hurry.

664
00:51:33,891 --> 00:51:35,754
I still can not contact
the Resistance?

665
00:51:36,651 --> 00:51:37,651
Keep trying.

666
00:51:37,783 --> 00:51:39,372
If you contact,
see how they are.

667
00:51:39,621 --> 00:51:40,792
And ask for Finn.

668
00:52:16,339 --> 00:52:17,669
Why does the Force connect us?

669
00:52:18,276 --> 00:52:19,032
To both.

670
00:52:19,291 --> 00:52:20,488
Killer snake.

671
00:52:21,425 --> 00:52:22,130
You're late.

672
00:52:22,395 --> 00:52:24,191
You lost. I found Skywalker.

673
00:52:25,723 --> 00:52:26,923
Did he tell you what happened?

674
00:52:28,224 --> 00:52:30,385
The night I destroyed your
temple, did he tell you why?

675
00:52:30,582 --> 00:52:33,003
I know everything
I need about you.

676
00:52:33,282 --> 00:52:34,743
Yes?

677
00:52:37,351 --> 00:52:39,115
Yes.

678
00:52:40,495 --> 00:52:42,350
You have that look in your eyes.

679
00:52:42,631 --> 00:52:44,276
The one in the forest.

680
00:52:47,017 --> 00:52:48,177
When you called me a monster.

681
00:52:48,449 --> 00:52:49,700
You are a monster.

682
00:52:55,673 --> 00:52:56,996
Yes I am.

683
00:53:22,460 --> 00:53:24,479
We enter, find the
encoder and exit.

684
00:53:24,619 --> 00:53:26,710
Do you know this city?
Can I sing Bight?

685
00:53:27,057 --> 00:53:28,057
For what they count.

686
00:53:28,353 --> 00:53:31,740
It's a horrible place full of
the worst people in the galaxy.

687
00:53:31,959 --> 00:53:32,959
Great.

688
00:53:54,190 --> 00:53:55,490
I told those two...

689
00:53:55,745 --> 00:53:58,286
"The beach is public, they
can not park that ferry."

690
00:53:58,565 --> 00:54:01,010
But they left at full
speed to the casino.

691
00:54:08,148 --> 00:54:09,471
Place your bets.

692
00:54:09,778 --> 00:54:12,508
All the bets on the table, now!
Place your bets here.

693
00:54:26,182 --> 00:54:27,182
Yes!

694
00:54:27,485 --> 00:54:29,170
This place is great!

695
00:54:29,919 --> 00:54:31,156
Good.

696
00:54:33,583 --> 00:54:36,952
Maz says that this master decoder
would have a red plumb flower.

697
00:54:37,203 --> 00:54:38,843
Let's go look for it
and get out of here.

698
00:54:39,116 --> 00:54:40,116
Well played.

699
00:54:40,253 --> 00:54:41,253
Win the house.

700
00:54:42,423 --> 00:54:44,321
- Rather, what are those manners?
- Come on!

701
00:55:07,798 --> 00:55:09,827
We toured the entire casino.
No ploom flower.

702
00:55:10,002 --> 00:55:11,046
Where is this guy?

703
00:55:16,546 --> 00:55:18,102
Are those what I think?

704
00:55:25,351 --> 00:55:26,405
What are those things?

705
00:55:26,429 --> 00:55:27,429
Fathiers.

706
00:55:28,251 --> 00:55:29,690
I never saw a real one.

707
00:55:30,405 --> 00:55:32,933
This whole place is beautiful.
Come on.

708
00:55:33,821 --> 00:55:35,265
Why do you hate him so much?

709
00:55:36,371 --> 00:55:37,611
Look better.

710
00:55:42,799 --> 00:55:45,532
My sister and I grew up
in a poor mining system.

711
00:55:47,260 --> 00:55:50,371
The First Order took us the
ore to finance its militia...

712
00:55:51,878 --> 00:55:53,855
then they bombarded us
to test their weapons.

713
00:55:59,953 --> 00:56:01,951
They took everything we had.

714
00:56:03,344 --> 00:56:05,821
And who do you think they were?

715
00:56:06,346 --> 00:56:09,599
There is only one business in the
galaxy that makes you so rich.

716
00:56:10,303 --> 00:56:11,513
War.

717
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,245
Sell weapons to the First Order.

718
00:56:16,269 --> 00:56:17,269
I would like...

719
00:56:17,451 --> 00:56:20,874
to cross with my fist this
disgusting and beautiful city.

720
00:56:28,358 --> 00:56:29,358
A red ploom flower!

721
00:56:37,582 --> 00:56:38,582
A red ploom flower!

722
00:56:38,804 --> 00:56:39,880
The master decipherer!

723
00:56:46,303 --> 00:56:47,744
Look, those are the
bad ones parked.

724
00:56:48,984 --> 00:56:49,984
It's okay.

725
00:56:50,118 --> 00:56:54,381
They are arrested for
parking violation 27B / 6.

726
00:56:54,657 --> 00:56:55,955
- They have the right...
- What was that?

727
00:56:55,979 --> 00:56:57,501
No no. Not now, honey.

728
00:56:57,908 --> 00:56:58,908
I have a good run.

729
00:58:41,989 --> 00:58:43,345
Lesson two.

730
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:47,555
Now that they are extinct,
they are idealized, deified.

731
00:58:48,171 --> 00:58:50,824
But if you take away the myths
and look at their works...

732
00:58:51,353 --> 00:58:53,370
The legacy of the
Jedi is failure.

733
00:58:53,649 --> 00:58:54,818
Hypocrisy, arrogance.

734
00:58:55,034 --> 00:58:56,034
Is not true.

735
00:58:56,145 --> 00:58:58,835
At the height of their power, they
decided to ascend to Darth Sidious...

736
00:58:58,859 --> 00:59:00,604
and create the Empire
and eliminate them.

737
00:59:01,062 --> 00:59:02,864
The Jedi Master was
responsible...

738
00:59:03,091 --> 00:59:06,044
for the training and
creation of Darth Vader.

739
00:59:06,392 --> 00:59:07,756
And he was saved by a Jedi.

740
00:59:08,540 --> 00:59:10,100
He is the most hated
man in the galaxy.

741
00:59:10,261 --> 00:59:12,385
But you saw that previously
I was conflicted.

742
00:59:12,619 --> 00:59:15,143
You thought it was not all bad.
That he could convert it.

743
00:59:15,558 --> 00:59:17,145
And I became a legend.

744
00:59:18,568 --> 00:59:20,553
For many years, there
was balance...

745
00:59:20,865 --> 00:59:22,179
and then I saw...

746
00:59:22,510 --> 00:59:23,510
to Ben.

747
00:59:24,957 --> 00:59:26,153
My nephew...

748
00:59:26,446 --> 00:59:28,428
with that powerful
Skywalker blood.

749
00:59:28,743 --> 00:59:29,924
And in my arrogance...

750
00:59:30,214 --> 00:59:33,364
I thought I could train him,
that my strength could pass.

751
00:59:34,637 --> 00:59:37,712
Han acted as expected, but...

752
00:59:40,424 --> 00:59:41,738
Read...

753
00:59:43,343 --> 00:59:45,581
He confided to his son.

754
00:59:46,428 --> 00:59:47,428
I took him...

755
00:59:48,447 --> 00:59:50,175
and a dozen students...

756
00:59:51,253 --> 00:59:52,681
and I started a training temple.

757
00:59:54,933 --> 00:59:59,992
When I noticed that I was no match
for the darkness that grew in him...

758
01:00:00,807 --> 01:00:02,287
It was already too late.

759
01:00:03,627 --> 01:00:04,876
What happened?

760
01:00:08,354 --> 01:00:09,614
I went to face it.

761
01:00:12,134 --> 01:00:13,621
And he turned against me.

762
01:00:14,171 --> 01:00:15,497
Ben, no!

763
01:00:18,732 --> 01:00:20,748
He must have thought
that I was dead.

764
01:00:22,488 --> 01:00:23,768
When I regained consciousness...

765
01:00:25,796 --> 01:00:27,421
the temple was burning.

766
01:00:28,915 --> 01:00:31,445
He had disappeared with a
handful of my students.

767
01:00:32,628 --> 01:00:34,761
And slaughtered the rest.

768
01:00:36,185 --> 01:00:38,135
Leia blamed Snoke, but...

769
01:00:38,881 --> 01:00:39,998
It was me.

770
01:00:40,811 --> 01:00:42,188
I failed.

771
01:00:45,594 --> 01:00:48,548
Because it was Luke Skywalker.

772
01:00:49,583 --> 01:00:51,323
The Jedi master.

773
01:00:56,768 --> 01:00:58,363
A legend.

774
01:01:00,620 --> 01:01:02,763
The galaxy may need a legend.

775
01:01:07,386 --> 01:01:11,553
I need someone to show
me my place in all this.

776
01:01:17,444 --> 01:01:18,985
And you did not fail Kylo.

777
01:01:19,339 --> 01:01:20,760
Kylo failed you.

778
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:22,820
I will not fail you.

779
01:01:43,829 --> 01:01:46,600
The main cruise
remains out of reach.

780
01:01:47,147 --> 01:01:48,932
But his medical frigate
has no fuel...

781
01:01:50,078 --> 01:01:51,743
He ran out of shields.

782
01:01:51,962 --> 01:01:53,731
The beginning of its end.

783
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:56,910
Destroy it.

784
01:02:00,034 --> 01:02:03,301
Our last crew member was
evacuated and goes to you.

785
01:02:04,401 --> 01:02:05,902
It was an honor, admiral.

786
01:02:06,164 --> 01:02:07,938
Good trip, Rebels!

787
01:02:11,333 --> 01:02:12,335
Admiral...

788
01:02:13,084 --> 01:02:14,964
there is fuel left
for six hours.

789
01:02:16,740 --> 01:02:18,740
Keep the current course.

790
01:02:19,605 --> 01:02:21,096
Keep it.

791
01:02:26,315 --> 01:02:29,901
Finn... Rose, where
are you guys?

792
01:02:34,886 --> 01:02:35,950
Repay me cards.

793
01:02:39,305 --> 01:02:40,305
Thank you.

794
01:02:42,066 --> 01:02:45,210
Finn, the fleet is in the last.

795
01:02:46,089 --> 01:02:48,988
Without a decipherer to sneak into
the Star Destroyer of Snoke...

796
01:02:50,091 --> 01:02:51,616
- What do we do?
- I do not know.

797
01:02:52,195 --> 01:02:55,195
If you do not have a thief in your pocket,
our plan does not go any further.

798
01:02:56,827 --> 01:02:58,060
I can do it.

799
01:03:02,432 --> 01:03:03,432
What?

800
01:03:04,930 --> 01:03:06,005
What?

801
01:03:06,991 --> 01:03:07,991
What?

802
01:03:08,103 --> 01:03:09,580
Excuse me, just...

803
01:03:10,118 --> 01:03:15,039
I could not help listening to
everything they said so loud...

804
01:03:15,840 --> 01:03:17,111
while trying to sleep.

805
01:03:19,343 --> 01:03:20,663
Decoder?

806
01:03:21,690 --> 01:03:22,930
Thief?

807
01:03:24,047 --> 01:03:25,159
I can do it.

808
01:03:25,382 --> 01:03:27,933
We do not talk about
stealing wallets, okay?

809
01:03:29,167 --> 01:03:30,852
Yes.

810
01:03:32,980 --> 01:03:34,845
Do not be fooled by my
appearance, friend.

811
01:03:35,647 --> 01:03:39,115
The codes of the First Order and I
have known each other for a long time.

812
01:03:41,060 --> 01:03:42,060
Y...

813
01:03:43,758 --> 01:03:45,532
If the price is reasonable...

814
01:03:46,898 --> 01:03:51,639
I could make you enter
Old Snoke's apartment.

815
01:03:53,509 --> 01:03:55,510
- Do not.
- Ya... we already have it under control.

816
01:04:13,599 --> 01:04:15,190
- Just...?
- Yes.

817
01:04:16,910 --> 01:04:18,501
We must get out of here!
Over here!

818
01:04:18,694 --> 01:04:19,694
Why, little one?

819
01:04:24,813 --> 01:04:26,510
You did this?

820
01:04:29,713 --> 01:04:30,713
Hey, get your hands up!

821
01:04:31,302 --> 01:04:32,302
Hands up!

822
01:04:32,688 --> 01:04:34,071
Yes, man.

823
01:04:50,104 --> 01:04:51,538
What is your story, chubby?

824
01:04:52,378 --> 01:04:53,378
They went out there!

825
01:04:58,173 --> 01:04:59,173
Close all exits.

826
01:04:59,297 --> 01:05:00,297
Wait.

827
01:05:04,664 --> 01:05:06,147
It smells great.

828
01:05:06,459 --> 01:05:08,243
Those cops will be here shortly.
And now?

829
01:05:41,232 --> 01:05:42,729
No wait. Please wait!

830
01:05:50,233 --> 01:05:51,531
We are with the Resistance.

831
01:05:57,471 --> 01:05:59,392
It is understood. Now we
will review the stables.

832
01:06:06,552 --> 01:06:08,779
- Here.
- They must have passed through here.

833
01:06:21,226 --> 01:06:22,592
Walking, walking!

834
01:06:29,161 --> 01:06:31,405
Stop enjoying it!

835
01:06:37,094 --> 01:06:39,164
<i>We've got them. They are
not going anywhere.</i>

836
01:07:23,145 --> 01:07:24,666
Move! Get out of the way!

837
01:07:26,689 --> 01:07:28,712
Our ship is on the beach
that we have ahead!

838
01:07:30,839 --> 01:07:31,839
We need protection!

839
01:07:42,539 --> 01:07:43,704
Too much protection!

840
01:07:56,194 --> 01:07:57,294
So is!

841
01:07:59,968 --> 01:08:00,718
Do not!

842
01:08:00,945 --> 01:08:01,945
Come on!

843
01:08:16,848 --> 01:08:18,537
<i>Let go of the flock.
Follow the criminals.</i>

844
01:08:24,342 --> 01:08:25,342
<i>Where did they go?</i>

845
01:08:28,604 --> 01:08:29,604
I think we lost it!

846
01:08:29,785 --> 01:08:31,603
Now we go down to the
beach and come back...

847
01:08:31,627 --> 01:08:32,627
A cliff!

848
01:08:42,378 --> 01:08:43,556
We're trapped.

849
01:08:46,675 --> 01:08:47,740
I think it was worth it.

850
01:08:48,480 --> 01:08:49,769
Raze that town...

851
01:08:50,088 --> 01:08:51,210
To hurt them.

852
01:09:00,834 --> 01:09:01,834
Come on.

853
01:09:06,829 --> 01:09:08,034
Now it's worth it.

854
01:09:18,375 --> 01:09:19,375
<i>They are there.</i>

855
01:09:24,835 --> 01:09:25,537
BB-8!

856
01:09:25,768 --> 01:09:27,221
Wait, are you
piloting that thing?

857
01:09:33,645 --> 01:09:34,958
Do you need a lift?

858
01:10:28,481 --> 01:10:29,481
Luke.

859
01:10:30,619 --> 01:10:31,722
Leia.

860
01:10:41,231 --> 01:10:42,591
I would prefer not
to do this now.

861
01:10:43,115 --> 01:10:44,399
Yes, the same.

862
01:10:47,180 --> 01:10:48,341
Why did you hate your father?

863
01:10:52,809 --> 01:10:55,128
Have something? A tunic
or something to wear?

864
01:10:58,982 --> 01:11:01,142
Why did you hate your father?
Answer me with sincerity.

865
01:11:02,853 --> 01:11:05,204
You had a father who loved you...
he cared

866
01:11:05,501 --> 01:11:06,501
I did not hate him.

867
01:11:06,606 --> 01:11:07,606
Then why?

868
01:11:07,918 --> 01:11:08,918
Why, what?

869
01:11:12,367 --> 01:11:13,756
Why what? Say it.

870
01:11:15,132 --> 01:11:16,429
Because it...?

871
01:11:17,224 --> 01:11:18,640
Because you killed?

872
01:11:19,576 --> 01:11:20,649
I do not understand.

873
01:11:20,974 --> 01:11:21,974
Do not?

874
01:11:22,086 --> 01:11:23,588
Your parents threw
you like garbage.

875
01:11:23,826 --> 01:11:25,854
- Do not!
- Yes.

876
01:11:26,089 --> 01:11:27,783
But you can not
stop needing them.

877
01:11:28,036 --> 01:11:29,196
It is your greatest weakness.

878
01:11:30,139 --> 01:11:31,339
You look for them everywhere...

879
01:11:31,363 --> 01:11:32,377
in Han Solo...

880
01:11:32,971 --> 01:11:34,667
now in Skywalker.

881
01:11:38,147 --> 01:11:39,864
Did he tell you what
happened that night?

882
01:11:40,277 --> 01:11:41,277
Yes.

883
01:11:43,310 --> 01:11:44,326
Do not.

884
01:11:46,109 --> 01:11:47,670
<i>He sensed my power...</i>

885
01:11:49,068 --> 01:11:50,708
how does he perceive yours?

886
01:11:52,032 --> 01:11:53,611
And that scared him.

887
01:12:10,432 --> 01:12:11,574
Liar.

888
01:12:16,037 --> 01:12:17,354
Let the past die.

889
01:12:19,006 --> 01:12:21,270
Kill him if necessary.

890
01:12:23,862 --> 01:12:26,504
It is the only way to become
what you are destined for.

891
01:13:09,124 --> 01:13:10,150
Do not!

892
01:13:10,174 --> 01:13:11,174
Do not!

893
01:13:51,345 --> 01:13:52,656
King?

894
01:14:21,524 --> 01:14:24,060
I should have felt
trapped or scared.

895
01:14:24,328 --> 01:14:25,619
But no.

896
01:14:29,190 --> 01:14:32,412
It did not last forever, I
knew I was going somewhere.

897
01:14:33,150 --> 01:14:35,553
And that, at last, would
show me what I came to see.

898
01:14:37,703 --> 01:14:39,119
King.

899
01:14:40,401 --> 01:14:45,893
<i>Subtitled by cinabenglu5.</i>

900
01:14:47,593 --> 01:14:49,624
Let me see them.

901
01:14:50,204 --> 01:14:52,074
To my parents...

902
01:14:52,364 --> 01:14:54,320
please.

903
01:15:29,239 --> 01:15:31,167
I thought that here I
would find answers.

904
01:15:32,896 --> 01:15:34,189
I was wrong.

905
01:15:36,669 --> 01:15:38,455
I never felt so lonely.

906
01:15:40,997 --> 01:15:42,230
You are not alone.

907
01:15:47,422 --> 01:15:48,575
You neither.

908
01:15:49,807 --> 01:15:50,967
King?

909
01:15:58,825 --> 01:16:00,294
It's not too late.

910
01:16:57,678 --> 01:16:58,678
Stop!

911
01:17:07,994 --> 01:17:08,996
It is true?

912
01:17:09,171 --> 01:17:10,776
Did you try to kill him?

913
01:17:11,022 --> 01:17:13,284
Leave this island now!

914
01:17:13,578 --> 01:17:14,615
Stop.

915
01:17:16,165 --> 01:17:17,165
Stop!

916
01:17:21,547 --> 01:17:22,547
You did it?

917
01:17:22,782 --> 01:17:24,686
Did you create Kylo Ren?

918
01:17:54,198 --> 01:17:55,653
Tell me the truth.

919
01:18:01,947 --> 01:18:03,749
I saw the darkness.

920
01:18:05,662 --> 01:18:07,415
<i>I felt it forming in him.</i>

921
01:18:07,735 --> 01:18:10,257
<i>I saw her at times
during her training.</i>

922
01:18:10,873 --> 01:18:12,524
<i>But then I looked inside...</i>

923
01:18:13,113 --> 01:18:15,735
<i>and it went beyond
what I never imagined.</i>

924
01:18:21,067 --> 01:18:23,584
<i>Snoke had already
converted his heart.</i>

925
01:18:24,317 --> 01:18:27,344
<i>He would bring destruction,
pain, death...</i>

926
01:18:27,589 --> 01:18:30,131
<i>and the end of everything I love
for what will end up being.</i>

927
01:18:30,390 --> 01:18:32,175
<i>And for the brief moment
of pure instinct...</i>

928
01:18:32,341 --> 01:18:33,736
<i>I thought I could stop it.</i>

929
01:18:37,010 --> 01:18:39,288
<i>It passed like a
fleeting shadow.</i>

930
01:18:40,296 --> 01:18:42,150
<i>And I left feeling ashamed...</i>

931
01:18:43,485 --> 01:18:45,339
<i>suffering the consequences.</i>

932
01:18:46,134 --> 01:18:48,307
<i>And the last thing I saw...</i>

933
01:18:48,578 --> 01:18:52,996
<i>they were the eyes of a frightened
boy whose teacher had failed him.</i>

934
01:18:54,717 --> 01:18:55,717
Come, no!

935
01:19:02,494 --> 01:19:04,609
You failed to think
that he already chose.

936
01:19:04,881 --> 01:19:05,881
It was not so.

937
01:19:06,160 --> 01:19:07,774
There is still conflict inside.

938
01:19:08,049 --> 01:19:10,489
If he turned from the dark side,
that could change everything.

939
01:19:10,845 --> 01:19:12,514
It could be the way to win.

940
01:19:12,712 --> 01:19:15,712
This is not going to
come out as you think.

941
01:19:16,235 --> 01:19:17,258
Yes.

942
01:19:17,662 --> 01:19:20,344
Only when we touch our hands...

943
01:19:20,586 --> 01:19:21,633
I saw your future.

944
01:19:22,800 --> 01:19:24,448
As solid as I see you.

945
01:19:24,875 --> 01:19:28,364
If I go with him, Ben
Solo will become.

946
01:19:28,615 --> 01:19:29,620
King...

947
01:19:30,228 --> 01:19:32,139
do not do it.

948
01:19:47,911 --> 01:19:49,608
Then he is our last hope.

949
01:20:30,234 --> 01:20:31,631
Yoda teacher.

950
01:20:32,468 --> 01:20:34,874
Young Skywalker.

951
01:20:37,174 --> 01:20:38,483
I'm going to finish all this.

952
01:20:38,958 --> 01:20:41,233
The tree, the text, the Jedi.

953
01:20:41,545 --> 01:20:42,705
I'm going to burn everything.

954
01:21:20,076 --> 01:21:22,310
Skywalker I missed you.

955
01:21:35,370 --> 01:21:36,898
So it's time...

956
01:21:38,522 --> 01:21:40,263
that the Jedi Order be finished.

957
01:21:40,461 --> 01:21:42,557
Time is.

958
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:52,064
Many old books you ignore.

959
01:21:53,018 --> 01:21:54,601
The sacred Jedi texts.

960
01:21:54,924 --> 01:21:56,853
Oh Read, have you?

961
01:21:57,757 --> 01:22:00,523
- Well, I...
- Exciting books... are not.

962
01:22:01,285 --> 01:22:02,996
Yes Yes.

963
01:22:03,311 --> 01:22:04,535
Wisdom possess...

964
01:22:04,809 --> 01:22:08,134
but that library contains
nothing that the girl King...

965
01:22:08,358 --> 01:22:10,172
no longer have

966
01:22:13,448 --> 01:22:14,967
Skywalker...

967
01:22:15,993 --> 01:22:17,792
Still looking for the horizon.

968
01:22:18,065 --> 01:22:20,422
Never here, now, huh?

969
01:22:20,709 --> 01:22:23,164
The need in your noses.

970
01:22:26,943 --> 01:22:28,484
I was weak.

971
01:22:29,741 --> 01:22:30,741
Unwise.

972
01:22:30,891 --> 01:22:33,256
Losing Solo, you did it.

973
01:22:34,166 --> 01:22:36,491
Losing King, we should not.

974
01:22:37,026 --> 01:22:39,743
I can not be what
she needs me to be.

975
01:22:40,419 --> 01:22:42,485
Pay attention to what I
said, you have not, right?

976
01:22:43,018 --> 01:22:45,368
Teach what you learned.

977
01:22:45,709 --> 01:22:47,797
Force... domain...

978
01:22:48,716 --> 01:22:50,124
But the weakness...

979
01:22:50,507 --> 01:22:52,794
foolishness... and also failure.

980
01:22:53,046 --> 01:22:56,007
Yes, more than
anything, failure.

981
01:22:56,250 --> 01:22:59,169
The greatest teacher,
the failure is.

982
01:23:08,422 --> 01:23:09,422
Luke...

983
01:23:11,960 --> 01:23:15,290
we are what they become.

984
01:23:16,128 --> 01:23:20,239
It is the true burden
of all teachers.

985
01:23:33,458 --> 01:23:35,300
Four parsecs to arrive.
Is very fast.

986
01:23:35,543 --> 01:23:37,111
I hope we are still on time.

987
01:23:37,371 --> 01:23:38,628
You can do it, right?

988
01:23:39,409 --> 01:23:41,268
Yes, with respect to that...

989
01:23:45,158 --> 01:23:48,405
Guys, I can do it.

990
01:23:49,465 --> 01:23:52,019
But there is a previous
conversation about the price.

991
01:23:52,912 --> 01:23:55,232
When we finish, the Resistance
will give you what you want.

992
01:23:56,083 --> 01:23:57,323
What do you have as an advance?

993
01:23:58,036 --> 01:24:00,151
Are you kidding? Look at us.

994
01:24:01,309 --> 01:24:02,951
Is that Haysian metal?

995
01:24:05,627 --> 01:24:06,915
It's already something.

996
01:24:07,113 --> 01:24:09,093
No, we gave you our word.
We are going to pay you.

997
01:24:09,392 --> 01:24:10,509
It should be enough.

998
01:24:10,738 --> 01:24:12,058
Guys, I want to
continue helping.

999
01:24:13,126 --> 01:24:16,528
But if there is nothing,
I do not do anything.

1000
01:24:16,739 --> 01:24:18,889
Well, listen... you must...

1001
01:24:19,261 --> 01:24:20,872
Do it.

1002
01:24:23,912 --> 01:24:25,597
Now I can help.

1003
01:24:28,144 --> 01:24:29,144
Give it back.

1004
01:24:30,654 --> 01:24:31,698
What?

1005
01:24:31,722 --> 01:24:33,755
Give it back!

1006
01:24:33,958 --> 01:24:35,710
You do not know what
it means to her.

1007
01:24:36,315 --> 01:24:39,145
What are you...? Why do you
plunder your own ship?

1008
01:24:41,776 --> 01:24:42,776
It is not your ship.

1009
01:24:44,637 --> 01:24:45,637
He says I stole it.

1010
01:24:45,779 --> 01:24:46,912
Yes I get it.

1011
01:24:47,209 --> 01:24:48,209
We stole it.

1012
01:24:49,900 --> 01:24:52,096
At least we rob the bad guys...

1013
01:24:52,731 --> 01:24:53,731
and help the good.

1014
01:24:53,907 --> 01:24:55,725
Good guys, bad guys...

1015
01:24:56,000 --> 01:24:57,987
Invented words.

1016
01:24:58,726 --> 01:25:02,227
Let's see who this precious
piece of scrap was from.

1017
01:25:05,350 --> 01:25:07,367
This guy was a weapons dealer.

1018
01:25:08,343 --> 01:25:11,496
He could found his side by
selling weapons to bad guys.

1019
01:25:15,814 --> 01:25:17,141
And the good ones.

1020
01:25:18,679 --> 01:25:21,521
Finn, let me show you
something important.

1021
01:25:22,952 --> 01:25:24,991
Everything is a
machinery, partner.

1022
01:25:26,666 --> 01:25:29,443
Live free, do not join.

1023
01:25:41,442 --> 01:25:43,786
It was his last support ship.

1024
01:25:44,071 --> 01:25:45,260
Now it's your main cruise.

1025
01:25:45,604 --> 01:25:46,926
And your fuel reserve?

1026
01:25:47,244 --> 01:25:50,513
According to our calculations...
very low.

1027
01:25:54,777 --> 01:25:56,733
- Is there?
- He forbade you to be on the bridge.

1028
01:25:56,757 --> 01:25:58,281
- Let's not make a fuss.
- Do not.

1029
01:25:58,545 --> 01:25:59,814
- Holdo?
- You can not be here.

1030
01:26:00,033 --> 01:26:00,835
Bold.

1031
01:26:01,014 --> 01:26:02,695
Enough, ma'am.

1032
01:26:02,974 --> 01:26:06,248
We had a fleet, now we have only one
ship and you did not tell us anything!

1033
01:26:06,871 --> 01:26:09,980
Tell us we have a plan!

1034
01:26:10,214 --> 01:26:11,214
That there is still hope!

1035
01:26:11,379 --> 01:26:12,658
When I served with Leia...

1036
01:26:12,975 --> 01:26:15,284
She said that hope
is like the sun.

1037
01:26:15,555 --> 01:26:17,986
If you only believe in him
when you can see him...

1038
01:26:18,221 --> 01:26:20,384
You will never
survive the night.

1039
01:26:20,854 --> 01:26:22,048
Yes.

1040
01:26:30,114 --> 01:26:32,153
Do you fuel the transports?

1041
01:26:37,638 --> 01:26:38,988
Yes.

1042
01:26:39,620 --> 01:26:40,799
To all?

1043
01:26:42,166 --> 01:26:44,551
Do we leave the ship? That is...

1044
01:26:45,085 --> 01:26:47,045
Is that your plan? That's
what you brought us for?

1045
01:26:47,837 --> 01:26:48,837
Coward!

1046
01:26:49,582 --> 01:26:52,280
Those transports are
unarmed, without shields.

1047
01:26:52,599 --> 01:26:54,741
If we abandon this
cruise, we are lost.

1048
01:26:54,957 --> 01:26:57,594
We have no chance No,
you're not just a coward...

1049
01:26:57,832 --> 01:26:59,351
You are a traitor.

1050
01:27:00,057 --> 01:27:02,088
Get this man out of my bridge.

1051
01:27:09,031 --> 01:27:11,150
Finn, Holdo takes the
crew to the ferry.

1052
01:27:11,370 --> 01:27:13,110
You will leave the ship.
Where are you?

1053
01:27:13,350 --> 01:27:14,832
Poe, we're returning
to the fleet.

1054
01:27:15,179 --> 01:27:16,214
We are so close.

1055
01:27:16,510 --> 01:27:17,550
And the master decipherer?

1056
01:27:17,742 --> 01:27:19,751
We find a decipherer.

1057
01:27:20,204 --> 01:27:23,264
We can disable the tracker.
Win a little more time.

1058
01:27:24,414 --> 01:27:26,009
All right. Hurry up.

1059
01:27:31,185 --> 01:27:32,826
As soon as it takes
off, get out of reach.

1060
01:27:33,070 --> 01:27:35,739
Stay there until I let you know
where the meeting point is.

1061
01:27:37,982 --> 01:27:41,374
If you see Finn before me...
tell him...

1062
01:27:43,648 --> 01:27:45,270
Yes, perfect. Tell that.

1063
01:28:51,740 --> 01:28:53,921
Camouflaged approach. They
should not detect us.

1064
01:28:54,810 --> 01:28:57,041
Then we make a slit
to his shield.

1065
01:28:59,968 --> 01:29:01,694
And we sneaked around.

1066
01:29:20,098 --> 01:29:23,189
So a Strumtrooper, who else?
Doing what?

1067
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:24,457
They try to save us.

1068
01:29:24,699 --> 01:29:26,325
It is our best chance to escape.

1069
01:29:26,439 --> 01:29:28,320
Give them all the time you
can to Finn and Rose.

1070
01:29:28,564 --> 01:29:30,838
You bet the survival
of the Resistance...

1071
01:29:31,031 --> 01:29:33,643
to something improbable
you put us all in danger.

1072
01:29:33,919 --> 01:29:35,063
Now time is over.

1073
01:29:35,262 --> 01:29:36,383
We must evacuate the cruise.

1074
01:29:36,527 --> 01:29:37,757
- Load the transports.
- Yes.

1075
01:29:37,916 --> 01:29:39,404
Yes, I had to say that.

1076
01:29:40,007 --> 01:29:41,344
Vice Admiral Holdo...

1077
01:29:41,596 --> 01:29:43,292
I take over your command...

1078
01:29:43,524 --> 01:29:46,652
so that this ship survives,
its crew and the Resistance.

1079
01:29:47,656 --> 01:29:49,873
I hope you understand
what we do.

1080
01:29:50,436 --> 01:29:51,436
Yes.

1081
01:29:51,586 --> 01:29:52,611
I'm going to the bridge.

1082
01:29:52,877 --> 01:29:54,836
If they move, stun them.

1083
01:30:14,623 --> 01:30:16,350
It is at least three cycles.

1084
01:30:16,556 --> 01:30:17,846
Yes sir. We work on that.

1085
01:30:18,096 --> 01:30:19,096
Very good.

1086
01:30:25,174 --> 01:30:26,997
I will do my best, sir.

1087
01:30:37,126 --> 01:30:38,216
We are almost there.

1088
01:30:47,436 --> 01:30:49,072
You do not have to do this.

1089
01:30:49,670 --> 01:30:51,166
I feel the conflict inside you.

1090
01:30:51,476 --> 01:30:53,032
It is destroying you.

1091
01:30:54,223 --> 01:30:56,408
And then, when we
touch our hands...

1092
01:30:56,646 --> 01:30:58,085
I saw your future.

1093
01:30:58,384 --> 01:31:00,610
Only its form, but
solidly and clearly.

1094
01:31:01,314 --> 01:31:03,452
You will not bow to Snoke.

1095
01:31:06,535 --> 01:31:07,939
You will become.

1096
01:31:10,259 --> 01:31:11,857
I'll help you.

1097
01:31:12,462 --> 01:31:13,828
I saw it.

1098
01:31:14,146 --> 01:31:15,639
I also saw something.

1099
01:31:17,219 --> 01:31:18,219
From what I saw...

1100
01:31:18,399 --> 01:31:20,635
I know that when the time
comes, you will become.

1101
01:31:21,514 --> 01:31:23,223
You will stay with me.

1102
01:31:23,979 --> 01:31:24,979
King.

1103
01:31:26,137 --> 01:31:28,285
I saw who your parents are.

1104
01:31:43,157 --> 01:31:47,314
Well done, my good and
faithful apprentice.

1105
01:31:47,643 --> 01:31:51,626
I regained my faith in you.

1106
01:31:52,867 --> 01:31:54,989
Young lady Rey.

1107
01:31:57,163 --> 01:31:58,609
Welcome.

1108
01:32:04,029 --> 01:32:05,161
Is this.

1109
01:32:05,404 --> 01:32:07,213
The tracker is behind this door.

1110
01:32:20,402 --> 01:32:22,445
Haysian metal.

1111
01:32:22,947 --> 01:32:24,094
Better driver.

1112
01:32:32,847 --> 01:32:34,209
And you're welcome.

1113
01:32:36,416 --> 01:32:38,217
Good time to see how to
get back to the fleet.

1114
01:32:38,345 --> 01:32:40,011
I know where the
nearest escape pod is.

1115
01:32:40,117 --> 01:32:40,833
Of course.

1116
01:32:41,075 --> 01:32:42,853
BB-8, tell me something good.

1117
01:32:44,744 --> 01:32:45,867
Poe, we're almost there.

1118
01:32:46,105 --> 01:32:47,374
<i>Ready the cruise for the jump.</i>

1119
01:32:47,499 --> 01:32:49,594
Yes, I'm in that, friend.
Hurry up.

1120
01:32:51,895 --> 01:32:53,586
Escort the officers
to the hangar.

1121
01:32:53,948 --> 01:32:57,242
Commander... Captain Dameron,
Admiral Holdo was looking for him.

1122
01:32:57,539 --> 01:32:58,628
Yes, we already talked.

1123
01:33:00,118 --> 01:33:02,299
Sir, I'm almost afraid to ask.

1124
01:33:02,497 --> 01:33:04,257
You have a good instinct, C-3PO.
Keep it up.

1125
01:33:17,100 --> 01:33:18,100
Seal that door!

1126
01:33:20,747 --> 01:33:21,811
We run out of time.

1127
01:33:21,835 --> 01:33:23,016
Come on, how's it going?

1128
01:33:23,281 --> 01:33:24,443
Almost ready.

1129
01:33:25,846 --> 01:33:27,489
C-3PO, where do you
think you're going?

1130
01:33:27,686 --> 01:33:29,724
I would go against my program...

1131
01:33:29,913 --> 01:33:31,554
- participate in a riot.
- Hears!

1132
01:33:31,744 --> 01:33:33,428
It is not a valid protocol.

1133
01:33:35,148 --> 01:33:36,647
Not this one!

1134
01:33:36,951 --> 01:33:37,677
Finn?

1135
01:33:37,701 --> 01:33:38,771
We are ready to jump.

1136
01:33:39,022 --> 01:33:40,228
It's now or never.

1137
01:33:43,752 --> 01:33:44,752
Now.

1138
01:34:10,824 --> 01:34:11,895
<i>You, hands up!</i>

1139
01:34:12,114 --> 01:34:13,114
<i>Watch them.</i>

1140
01:34:13,305 --> 01:34:15,051
<i>- Throw your weapons.
- Hands up, rebels.</i>

1141
01:34:15,075 --> 01:34:16,582
<i>Lower them! Lower them, I said!</i>

1142
01:34:26,494 --> 01:34:28,128
<i>FN-2187.</i>

1143
01:34:30,208 --> 01:34:32,479
<i>It's good that you came back.</i>

1144
01:34:33,326 --> 01:34:34,326
They did not make it.

1145
01:34:48,241 --> 01:34:49,241
Leia.

1146
01:35:00,713 --> 01:35:04,397
<i>Approach transportation according
to your evacuation designation.</i>

1147
01:35:04,577 --> 01:35:05,577
<i>Clear the transports.</i>

1148
01:35:05,745 --> 01:35:06,816
Let me push them, guys.

1149
01:35:07,177 --> 01:35:08,517
That is problematic.

1150
01:35:09,240 --> 01:35:10,451
I like it.

1151
01:35:11,224 --> 01:35:12,224
Me too.

1152
01:35:12,909 --> 01:35:14,919
It's time to approach
your transport.

1153
01:35:16,045 --> 01:35:17,726
So that transports escape...

1154
01:35:18,749 --> 01:35:21,638
someone must stay to
pilot the cruise.

1155
01:35:26,254 --> 01:35:27,745
Too many casualties.

1156
01:35:29,426 --> 01:35:31,396
Ican't hold it any more.

1157
01:35:31,904 --> 01:35:32,972
Of course you can.

1158
01:35:34,550 --> 01:35:36,512
You showed me how.

1159
01:35:38,986 --> 01:35:40,183
What the Force...

1160
01:35:42,256 --> 01:35:43,857
Follow you I already
repeated it enough.

1161
01:35:45,627 --> 01:35:49,092
May the force always
accompany you.

1162
01:35:55,849 --> 01:35:58,964
<i>Activated camouflage device.
We should be out of reach.</i>

1163
01:35:59,212 --> 01:36:01,451
Hopefully it works.

1164
01:36:17,940 --> 01:36:20,211
Come closer, girl.

1165
01:36:22,969 --> 01:36:25,419
Too much strength.

1166
01:36:25,866 --> 01:36:28,838
The darkness ascends...

1167
01:36:29,061 --> 01:36:32,658
and light too, to meet her.

1168
01:36:33,678 --> 01:36:35,223
I warned my young apprentice...

1169
01:36:35,510 --> 01:36:37,397
that if it got stronger...

1170
01:36:37,802 --> 01:36:40,378
its equivalent in
light would rise.

1171
01:36:42,951 --> 01:36:43,951
Skywalker...

1172
01:36:44,447 --> 01:36:45,924
I assumed...

1173
01:36:47,108 --> 01:36:48,108
mistakenly.

1174
01:36:51,236 --> 01:36:53,056
Closer, I said.

1175
01:37:00,056 --> 01:37:01,288
You underestimate Skywalker...

1176
01:37:02,217 --> 01:37:03,289
to Ben Solo...

1177
01:37:03,986 --> 01:37:05,300
and me.

1178
01:37:05,870 --> 01:37:07,642
That will be your downfall.

1179
01:37:09,435 --> 01:37:11,193
You have seen something?

1180
01:37:11,710 --> 01:37:14,465
A weak point in my apprentice.

1181
01:37:14,794 --> 01:37:16,684
Is that why you came?

1182
01:37:19,534 --> 01:37:20,959
Silly young girl.

1183
01:37:21,335 --> 01:37:24,965
It was me who connected
their minds.

1184
01:37:25,483 --> 01:37:28,767
I fueled Ren's
internal conflict.

1185
01:37:28,974 --> 01:37:32,043
I knew he was not strong
enough to hide it from you.

1186
01:37:32,181 --> 01:37:37,359
And that you were not so
wise as to resist that bait.

1187
01:37:40,965 --> 01:37:42,049
And now...

1188
01:37:42,760 --> 01:37:47,842
you will give me Skywalker.

1189
01:37:48,517 --> 01:37:51,058
Then I will kill you...

1190
01:37:51,410 --> 01:37:53,979
with the most atrocious blow.

1191
01:37:54,922 --> 01:37:55,922
Do not.

1192
01:37:56,445 --> 01:37:57,668
Yes.

1193
01:38:01,716 --> 01:38:04,187
Give to me...

1194
01:38:05,668 --> 01:38:07,267
all.

1195
01:38:07,942 --> 01:38:09,574
Do not!

1196
01:38:10,264 --> 01:38:11,264
Do not!

1197
01:38:18,108 --> 01:38:19,628
Do not.

1198
01:38:19,881 --> 01:38:20,913
No no!

1199
01:38:25,961 --> 01:38:26,961
Poe.

1200
01:38:32,736 --> 01:38:33,736
What is that?

1201
01:38:33,891 --> 01:38:35,546
The mineral planet, Crait.

1202
01:38:35,819 --> 01:38:38,088
An unknown hiding place from
the days of the Rebellion.

1203
01:38:38,669 --> 01:38:40,478
- Is that a Rebel base?
- Abandoned...

1204
01:38:41,009 --> 01:38:42,143
but strongly armored...

1205
01:38:42,167 --> 01:38:44,387
that can send a distress
signal to the allies...

1206
01:38:44,553 --> 01:38:45,782
scattered in the Outer Rim.

1207
01:38:45,931 --> 01:38:47,683
Holdo knew that the
First Order...

1208
01:38:47,861 --> 01:38:49,050
he was tracking our big ship.

1209
01:38:49,178 --> 01:38:51,874
They do not monitor
small transports.

1210
01:38:52,524 --> 01:38:54,605
We could go down to the
surface without being seen...

1211
01:38:54,961 --> 01:38:57,958
and hide until the
First Order passes.

1212
01:39:00,214 --> 01:39:01,214
It could work.

1213
01:39:02,936 --> 01:39:07,302
She was more interested in
protecting the light than in...

1214
01:39:07,895 --> 01:39:10,216
look like a heroine.

1215
01:39:22,219 --> 01:39:23,321
Good trip...

1216
01:39:23,718 --> 01:39:25,171
Rebels.

1217
01:39:54,564 --> 01:39:55,880
Good job, Phasma.

1218
01:39:57,074 --> 01:39:59,687
Your ship and your
payment, as we agreed.

1219
01:40:07,583 --> 01:40:09,038
Lying snake.

1220
01:40:13,966 --> 01:40:16,138
They caught us...

1221
01:40:16,946 --> 01:40:18,848
I made a deal.

1222
01:40:19,752 --> 01:40:20,800
Wait...

1223
01:40:21,472 --> 01:40:22,676
A deal with what?

1224
01:40:22,927 --> 01:40:24,568
We send you the
information of the thief.

1225
01:40:25,055 --> 01:40:27,355
We say a sweep of des
camouflage, and, effectively...

1226
01:40:27,643 --> 01:40:29,863
there were 30 freshly launched
Resistance transports.

1227
01:40:31,047 --> 01:40:33,136
He told us the truth.

1228
01:40:34,055 --> 01:40:35,671
Are the surprises never over?

1229
01:40:35,873 --> 01:40:36,873
Do not.

1230
01:40:37,304 --> 01:40:38,470
Are our weapons ready?

1231
01:40:38,494 --> 01:40:39,702
Lists and notes, sir.

1232
01:40:40,674 --> 01:40:42,118
Shoot at will.

1233
01:40:43,000 --> 01:40:44,334
Wait. No, You can not!

1234
01:40:45,073 --> 01:40:46,330
Do not!

1235
01:41:00,383 --> 01:41:01,834
Admiral, we are under attack!

1236
01:41:02,175 --> 01:41:03,716
- We go back?
- No, they're too far away.

1237
01:41:03,740 --> 01:41:05,186
Maximum speed to the base!

1238
01:41:05,549 --> 01:41:06,549
At full speed!

1239
01:41:12,655 --> 01:41:14,115
Good good...

1240
01:41:14,376 --> 01:41:17,958
I did not expect
Skywalker to be so wise.

1241
01:41:18,700 --> 01:41:21,139
We will give him and
the Jedi Order...

1242
01:41:21,354 --> 01:41:23,810
the death he wants.

1243
01:41:24,357 --> 01:41:25,596
When the Rebels die...

1244
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:27,038
we will go to your planet...

1245
01:41:27,385 --> 01:41:31,076
and we will devastate
the whole island.

1246
01:41:37,935 --> 01:41:39,177
You have so much determination.

1247
01:41:39,984 --> 01:41:40,986
Now look here.

1248
01:41:48,434 --> 01:41:53,267
All the Resistance is
in those transports...

1249
01:41:54,166 --> 01:41:57,779
Soon they will all be dead.

1250
01:41:58,176 --> 01:42:01,131
For you, everything is lost.

1251
01:42:06,361 --> 01:42:09,197
And you still have that
fiery breath of hope.

1252
01:42:10,824 --> 01:42:13,876
You have the spirit
of a true Jedi!

1253
01:42:22,363 --> 01:42:23,534
And so...

1254
01:42:24,753 --> 01:42:26,041
you must die.

1255
01:42:28,951 --> 01:42:31,007
My valuable apprentice...

1256
01:42:31,221 --> 01:42:34,779
son of darkness, the
apparent heir of Lord Vader.

1257
01:42:35,101 --> 01:42:38,459
Where there was conflict,
now being determination.

1258
01:42:38,694 --> 01:42:41,191
Where there was
weakness, strength.

1259
01:42:42,166 --> 01:42:43,700
Finish your training...

1260
01:42:44,043 --> 01:42:48,190
and fulfill your destiny.

1261
01:42:57,625 --> 01:42:59,263
I know what I have to do.

1262
01:43:01,303 --> 01:43:02,303
Ben.

1263
01:43:04,083 --> 01:43:06,109
Do you think you can convert it?

1264
01:43:06,718 --> 01:43:08,438
Pathetic girl.

1265
01:43:10,033 --> 01:43:12,303
I can not be betrayed...

1266
01:43:12,522 --> 01:43:14,541
I can not be beaten.

1267
01:43:14,794 --> 01:43:17,055
I see your mind...

1268
01:43:17,270 --> 01:43:20,285
I see all your intentions.

1269
01:43:20,566 --> 01:43:21,566
Yes.

1270
01:43:22,925 --> 01:43:28,481
I see it lighting the
Lightsaber to hit the truth.

1271
01:43:29,092 --> 01:43:30,176
And now...

1272
01:43:30,959 --> 01:43:34,811
Silly girl... he lights it...

1273
01:43:35,575 --> 01:43:39,047
And kill your real enemy!

1274
01:44:19,819 --> 01:44:21,405
Maximum thrusters.
At full speed!

1275
01:44:21,644 --> 01:44:22,977
Yes sir.

1276
01:44:25,709 --> 01:44:27,142
Damn murderer.

1277
01:44:27,926 --> 01:44:29,864
Calm down, Great F.

1278
01:44:30,470 --> 01:44:33,247
They burst you today, you
blow them up tomorrow.

1279
01:44:33,958 --> 01:44:35,531
They are only business.

1280
01:44:38,130 --> 01:44:39,219
You're wrong.

1281
01:44:42,973 --> 01:44:44,057
Maybe.

1282
01:46:26,676 --> 01:46:27,676
Ben!

1283
01:46:40,171 --> 01:46:40,867
The fleet.

1284
01:46:41,027 --> 01:46:42,205
Order them to cease fire.

1285
01:46:42,229 --> 01:46:43,922
There is still time
to save the fleet.

1286
01:46:52,533 --> 01:46:53,565
Ben?

1287
01:46:55,822 --> 01:46:57,660
It's time to let
all the old die.

1288
01:47:00,297 --> 01:47:01,430
Snoke...

1289
01:47:01,727 --> 01:47:02,936
Skywalker.

1290
01:47:05,184 --> 01:47:06,311
The Sith...

1291
01:47:07,018 --> 01:47:10,235
the Jedi, the Rebels...
Let them all die.

1292
01:47:10,994 --> 01:47:11,994
King.

1293
01:47:14,044 --> 01:47:15,436
I want you to join me.

1294
01:47:17,458 --> 01:47:19,910
We can reign together and bring
a new order to the galaxy.

1295
01:47:20,176 --> 01:47:21,482
Do not do this, Ben.

1296
01:47:22,656 --> 01:47:23,658
Do not go this way.

1297
01:47:23,946 --> 01:47:27,227
No. You're holding on! Come on!

1298
01:47:28,507 --> 01:47:30,688
Do you want to know the
truth about your parents?

1299
01:47:31,777 --> 01:47:33,102
Or did you always know?

1300
01:47:35,735 --> 01:47:37,271
And you simply hid it.

1301
01:47:39,416 --> 01:47:40,670
You know the truth.

1302
01:47:41,654 --> 01:47:42,986
Tell the.

1303
01:47:46,195 --> 01:47:47,285
Tell the.

1304
01:47:49,380 --> 01:47:50,749
They were nobody.

1305
01:47:51,045 --> 01:47:52,592
They were dirty
scrap merchants...

1306
01:47:52,805 --> 01:47:54,550
who sold you to have
money to drink.

1307
01:47:56,542 --> 01:47:57,257
They are dead...

1308
01:47:57,546 --> 01:47:59,705
in a very poor grave in
the desert of Jakku.

1309
01:48:00,609 --> 01:48:02,563
There is no place for
you in this story.

1310
01:48:02,725 --> 01:48:04,845
You grew up without having anything.
You are nothing.

1311
01:48:08,973 --> 01:48:10,070
But not for me.

1312
01:48:14,450 --> 01:48:15,450
Join me.

1313
01:48:28,520 --> 01:48:29,619
Please.

1314
01:48:59,817 --> 01:49:00,817
Mr...

1315
01:49:01,342 --> 01:49:03,975
the Resistance cruiser
prepares for the jump.

1316
01:49:04,847 --> 01:49:05,847
It is empty.

1317
01:49:06,103 --> 01:49:07,789
They are trying to
divert our attention.

1318
01:49:08,385 --> 01:49:09,449
Pathetic.

1319
01:49:09,695 --> 01:49:11,736
Keep attacking the transports.

1320
01:49:39,487 --> 01:49:42,084
<i>Running them with a blaster
is too good for them.</i>

1321
01:49:42,327 --> 01:49:44,156
<i>That hurts.</i>

1322
01:49:49,975 --> 01:49:50,975
Finn...

1323
01:49:55,508 --> 01:49:56,974
<i>When ordered.</i>

1324
01:50:01,844 --> 01:50:02,891
She is escaping.

1325
01:50:05,217 --> 01:50:06,277
Do not.

1326
01:50:20,139 --> 01:50:21,190
Do not!

1327
01:50:21,214 --> 01:50:23,071
Shoot that cruise!

1328
01:50:36,989 --> 01:50:37,989
<i>Execute</i>

1329
01:51:21,557 --> 01:51:22,557
Finn!

1330
01:51:22,837 --> 01:51:25,583
There's a ferry back there!
We have to go!

1331
01:51:40,934 --> 01:51:41,934
<i>Traitor!</i>

1332
01:51:43,963 --> 01:51:44,992
<i>What?</i>

1333
01:52:08,297 --> 01:52:09,297
Finn!

1334
01:52:28,305 --> 01:52:30,005
<i>You are a mistake in the system.</i>

1335
01:52:30,445 --> 01:52:31,544
Come on, baby.

1336
01:52:39,283 --> 01:52:40,283
Come on!

1337
01:52:49,963 --> 01:52:50,963
Do not!

1338
01:52:56,708 --> 01:52:57,708
Hears.

1339
01:53:13,798 --> 01:53:16,136
<i>They were always garbage.</i>

1340
01:53:17,764 --> 01:53:19,088
Rebel waste.

1341
01:53:32,668 --> 01:53:33,362
Hears!

1342
01:53:33,628 --> 01:53:34,908
Do you need someone to take you?

1343
01:54:12,314 --> 01:54:14,284
What happened?

1344
01:54:14,997 --> 01:54:16,551
The girl killed Snoke.

1345
01:54:21,010 --> 01:54:22,240
What happened?

1346
01:54:22,567 --> 01:54:24,921
He took Snoke's escape ship.

1347
01:54:25,477 --> 01:54:26,764
We know where he is going.

1348
01:54:27,857 --> 01:54:29,538
Send troops to that
base of the Resistance.

1349
01:54:30,006 --> 01:54:31,351
We finish this.

1350
01:54:32,234 --> 01:54:33,272
Finish this?

1351
01:54:33,941 --> 01:54:35,891
Who do you think
is talking to you?

1352
01:54:36,519 --> 01:54:38,900
Are you going to
command my troops?

1353
01:54:39,736 --> 01:54:43,010
Our Supreme Leader is dead!
We do not have a ruler!

1354
01:54:47,530 --> 01:54:50,801
The Supreme Leader is dead.

1355
01:54:52,802 --> 01:54:55,982
Long live the Supreme Leader.

1356
01:55:13,540 --> 01:55:15,536
They are coming,
close the doors.

1357
01:55:23,403 --> 01:55:24,944
Entering!

1358
01:55:28,601 --> 01:55:30,403
Walking! Move!

1359
01:55:31,435 --> 01:55:33,340
Close that door of
the shield well!

1360
01:55:49,066 --> 01:55:51,284
- Do not shoot! We are!
- Do not shoot!

1361
01:55:51,604 --> 01:55:52,604
Stop the fire!

1362
01:55:52,760 --> 01:55:54,844
- Do not shoot!
- Stop the fire!

1363
01:55:57,475 --> 01:55:58,475
- Finn?
- Finn!

1364
01:55:59,107 --> 01:56:00,693
Rose! You are not dead!

1365
01:56:00,892 --> 01:56:02,020
Where is my droid?

1366
01:56:03,418 --> 01:56:04,418
Companion!

1367
01:56:04,618 --> 01:56:06,588
I'm so happy to see you!

1368
01:56:08,429 --> 01:56:09,429
Wait to?

1369
01:56:09,586 --> 01:56:10,610
Wait, more slowly.

1370
01:56:10,766 --> 01:56:11,945
Is all that remains?

1371
01:56:22,271 --> 01:56:24,438
We have the shields, they
can not give us from orbit.

1372
01:56:24,857 --> 01:56:26,086
Use the power we have...

1373
01:56:26,226 --> 01:56:28,209
to issue a distress
signal to the Outer Rim.

1374
01:56:28,369 --> 01:56:29,844
Use my personal code.

1375
01:56:30,549 --> 01:56:33,380
If there is any ally
to the Resistance...

1376
01:56:33,864 --> 01:56:34,866
it's now or never.

1377
01:56:35,706 --> 01:56:37,525
Rose, what do you have?

1378
01:56:38,130 --> 01:56:41,519
Rotted munitions, rusted artillery,
and broken skim speeders.

1379
01:56:41,820 --> 01:56:42,820
Good...

1380
01:56:43,817 --> 01:56:47,576
Let us pray that this door
will hold until we get help.

1381
01:56:58,156 --> 01:56:59,718
A gun ram.

1382
01:57:00,071 --> 01:57:01,582
A what, sorry?

1383
01:57:02,133 --> 01:57:03,457
A mini Death Star.

1384
01:57:03,708 --> 01:57:05,259
It will break that
door like nothing.

1385
01:57:06,332 --> 01:57:08,116
There has to be a
back door, right?

1386
01:57:09,329 --> 01:57:11,005
BB-8, what do you have?

1387
01:57:11,906 --> 01:57:14,917
BB-8 analyzed the
scheme of the mine.

1388
01:57:15,214 --> 01:57:18,080
This is the only way
to enter or exit.

1389
01:57:25,721 --> 01:57:26,721
Come on.

1390
01:57:27,554 --> 01:57:28,613
We have allies.

1391
01:57:29,046 --> 01:57:30,817
People believe in Leia.

1392
01:57:31,479 --> 01:57:33,440
They will receive our
message and they will come.

1393
01:57:33,603 --> 01:57:35,665
But we have to buy time.

1394
01:57:36,798 --> 01:57:39,299
We are going to
destroy that canyon.

1395
01:57:43,222 --> 01:57:44,260
To me!

1396
01:57:45,562 --> 01:57:46,563
Move!

1397
01:57:47,173 --> 01:57:48,399
Behind! Take your weapons!

1398
01:57:48,696 --> 01:57:49,983
Come here!

1399
01:57:50,270 --> 01:57:51,270
Do not shoot!

1400
01:58:08,562 --> 01:58:09,345
It's salt.

1401
01:58:09,544 --> 01:58:10,852
Forces of surfaces, entering.

1402
01:58:10,974 --> 01:58:12,429
Understood, we're on our way.

1403
01:58:29,820 --> 01:58:30,908
Turn on your mono-ski.

1404
01:58:31,187 --> 01:58:32,559
The green switch.

1405
01:58:42,732 --> 01:58:43,758
Well, listen.

1406
01:58:44,011 --> 01:58:45,358
<i>I do not like these scraps...</i>

1407
01:58:45,658 --> 01:58:47,006
nor our possibilities, but...

1408
01:58:47,564 --> 01:58:48,741
What the hell?

1409
01:58:48,984 --> 01:58:50,216
Stay together...

1410
01:58:50,460 --> 01:58:53,337
and do not get too close until
they take out the cannon.

1411
01:59:13,055 --> 01:59:15,213
Surface forces, shoot a little!

1412
01:59:28,218 --> 01:59:29,912
13 light ships arrive.

1413
01:59:30,287 --> 01:59:32,029
Do we wait until
we eliminate them?

1414
01:59:32,336 --> 01:59:35,012
No. The Resistance
is in that mine.

1415
01:59:35,696 --> 01:59:36,777
Go through them.

1416
01:59:41,668 --> 01:59:42,999
Fighters, get separated!

1417
01:59:53,150 --> 01:59:55,828
Come on! We have to stop them
until they take out that cannon!

1418
02:00:11,340 --> 02:00:13,226
<i>Rose, you have three behind you!</i>

1419
02:00:20,816 --> 02:00:21,816
I can not lose them.

1420
02:00:29,730 --> 02:00:30,730
Yes!

1421
02:00:44,255 --> 02:00:45,255
I like this!

1422
02:00:53,939 --> 02:00:56,913
Fly that junk to pieces and
get it out of the sky!

1423
02:00:57,145 --> 02:00:58,367
All the fighters!

1424
02:01:05,660 --> 02:01:07,126
Chewie, get them
out of the battle.

1425
02:01:07,462 --> 02:01:08,717
Get away from the speeders.

1426
02:01:14,389 --> 02:01:16,093
She drove them away! To all!

1427
02:01:16,350 --> 02:01:17,741
Oh, they hate that ship!

1428
02:01:30,635 --> 02:01:31,635
Chewie!

1429
02:02:02,419 --> 02:02:03,419
There is!

1430
02:02:08,581 --> 02:02:09,594
That is a big weapon.

1431
02:02:09,827 --> 02:02:11,059
It is heavily armored.

1432
02:02:11,267 --> 02:02:13,348
The only possibility is to
go straight to the throat.

1433
02:02:21,007 --> 02:02:22,650
The cannon opens. It
is our opportunity.

1434
02:02:22,889 --> 02:02:24,232
Shoot everything
to those speeders.

1435
02:02:24,256 --> 02:02:26,425
Concentrate fire
on those speeders!

1436
02:02:33,446 --> 02:02:35,018
We are having great losses.

1437
02:02:47,221 --> 02:02:49,184
They destroy us one by one. We
are not going to achieve it.

1438
02:02:49,208 --> 02:02:50,826
<i>I make my final approach.</i>

1439
02:02:51,046 --> 02:02:52,394
<i>Target in sight, ready weapons.</i>

1440
02:02:52,598 --> 02:02:53,712
Do not! Stop!

1441
02:02:53,975 --> 02:02:54,975
What?

1442
02:02:55,198 --> 02:02:56,717
The cannon is loaded!
It is suicidal!

1443
02:02:56,741 --> 02:02:57,990
<i>To all the ships, get away!</i>

1444
02:02:58,295 --> 02:03:00,297
- Do not! I'm almost there!
- Withdrawal, Finn!

1445
02:03:00,545 --> 02:03:01,590
That's an order.

1446
02:03:10,654 --> 02:03:12,608
Finn? It's too late!
Do not do it!

1447
02:03:12,916 --> 02:03:14,752
Do not! I will not let them win!

1448
02:03:16,903 --> 02:03:18,763
Do not! Finn, listen to Poe!

1449
02:03:19,034 --> 02:03:20,306
<i>We have to retire!</i>

1450
02:03:33,365 --> 02:03:34,719
<i>The cannon is heating up.</i>

1451
02:03:34,928 --> 02:03:36,054
<i>It is understood. We see it.</i>

1452
02:03:36,309 --> 02:03:37,848
<i>Prepare to shoot.</i>

1453
02:04:19,413 --> 02:04:21,281
Move! Walking! Quick!

1454
02:04:21,461 --> 02:04:22,956
Come on!

1455
02:04:29,491 --> 02:04:30,576
Rose?

1456
02:04:36,269 --> 02:04:37,269
Rose?

1457
02:04:37,734 --> 02:04:39,092
Rose?

1458
02:04:40,079 --> 02:04:41,079
Because you did?

1459
02:04:41,933 --> 02:04:43,650
It had almost arrived.

1460
02:04:44,598 --> 02:04:45,903
Why did you stop me?

1461
02:04:46,824 --> 02:04:48,962
I saved you...

1462
02:04:50,096 --> 02:04:51,096
fool.

1463
02:04:52,023 --> 02:04:53,547
This is how we are going to win.

1464
02:04:53,852 --> 02:04:56,136
Not fighting against
what we hate...

1465
02:04:56,653 --> 02:04:58,979
but saving what we love.

1466
02:05:18,269 --> 02:05:21,225
General Hux... Advance.

1467
02:05:21,753 --> 02:05:23,177
No quarter.

1468
02:05:24,728 --> 02:05:26,339
Without prisoners.

1469
02:05:28,035 --> 02:05:31,076
Our distress signal was
received in many places...

1470
02:05:31,385 --> 02:05:33,302
but it was not answered.

1471
02:05:34,621 --> 02:05:38,379
They heard us...
but nobody comes.

1472
02:05:42,425 --> 02:05:44,651
We fight until the end.

1473
02:05:46,986 --> 02:05:51,783
But... the galaxy lost all hope.

1474
02:05:53,223 --> 02:05:54,682
The spark...

1475
02:05:56,595 --> 02:05:58,073
it went out

1476
02:06:23,369 --> 02:06:24,773
Luke.

1477
02:06:33,306 --> 02:06:35,803
I know what you
are going to say.

1478
02:06:37,054 --> 02:06:38,755
That I combed differently.

1479
02:06:40,838 --> 02:06:42,395
It looks good like that.

1480
02:06:44,297 --> 02:06:45,981
Read...

1481
02:06:47,171 --> 02:06:48,171
I am sorry.

1482
02:06:48,320 --> 02:06:50,028
I know.

1483
02:06:50,262 --> 02:06:52,373
I know that it is.

1484
02:06:53,273 --> 02:06:55,160
I'm glad you're here...

1485
02:06:56,129 --> 02:06:57,609
at the end.

1486
02:06:59,058 --> 02:07:00,856
I came to face him, Leia.

1487
02:07:02,838 --> 02:07:05,019
And I can not save it.

1488
02:07:05,481 --> 02:07:08,577
For a long time I
kept hope, but...

1489
02:07:11,487 --> 02:07:13,816
I know that my son is no more.

1490
02:07:14,847 --> 02:07:17,392
Nobody leaves really, never.

1491
02:07:52,819 --> 02:07:54,502
Master Luke.

1492
02:08:44,668 --> 02:08:47,235
I want to be shot with
everything we have that man.

1493
02:08:52,436 --> 02:08:53,944
Do it.

1494
02:09:10,449 --> 02:09:11,449
Plus!

1495
02:09:14,855 --> 02:09:15,855
Plus!

1496
02:09:30,199 --> 02:09:31,798
Enough.

1497
02:09:33,207 --> 02:09:35,368
Enough!

1498
02:09:41,279 --> 02:09:42,905
Do you think he beat him?

1499
02:09:44,183 --> 02:09:45,866
If we are ready to move...

1500
02:09:46,219 --> 02:09:48,228
we can finish this.

1501
02:09:48,543 --> 02:09:49,582
Mr?

1502
02:10:15,846 --> 02:10:17,019
Take me with him.

1503
02:10:17,521 --> 02:10:20,263
Keep the door covered and do
not advance until I tell you.

1504
02:10:20,573 --> 02:10:21,573
Supreme leader...

1505
02:10:21,914 --> 02:10:23,350
Do not get distracted,
our goal...

1506
02:10:25,851 --> 02:10:26,975
Right now, sir.

1507
02:10:28,155 --> 02:10:29,698
Medical package!

1508
02:10:29,897 --> 02:10:31,772
We need a medical package!

1509
02:10:32,084 --> 02:10:34,017
She is very badly hurt.

1510
02:10:52,694 --> 02:10:53,834
It's Kylo Ren.

1511
02:10:54,087 --> 02:10:55,285
Luke confronts him alone.

1512
02:10:55,496 --> 02:10:56,695
We should help him. Come on.

1513
02:10:57,003 --> 02:10:58,590
No wait. Wait.

1514
02:11:12,524 --> 02:11:14,786
Did you come back to
say you forgive me?

1515
02:11:15,975 --> 02:11:17,753
To save my soul?

1516
02:11:19,579 --> 02:11:21,100
Do not.

1517
02:11:39,853 --> 02:11:42,004
He does it for a reason.

1518
02:11:43,896 --> 02:11:45,619
A long time ago we can escape.

1519
02:11:45,802 --> 02:11:46,549
Escape?

1520
02:11:46,752 --> 02:11:49,381
It is one against an army. We
have to fight and help him.

1521
02:11:49,527 --> 02:11:53,370
No. We are the spark that will ignite
the fire that burns the First Order.

1522
02:11:54,564 --> 02:11:57,307
Skywalker does it
so we can survive.

1523
02:11:57,792 --> 02:12:00,447
There must be an exit from this mine.
Hell, how did he get in?

1524
02:12:00,680 --> 02:12:04,553
It is possible that there is
a natural input not mapped.

1525
02:12:04,786 --> 02:12:07,629
But this installation is such a
labyrinth of endless tunnels...

1526
02:12:07,875 --> 02:12:12,101
that the possibility of
finding an exit is 15,428...

1527
02:12:12,326 --> 02:12:13,724
Shut up!

1528
02:12:15,190 --> 02:12:16,829
- To one.
- Listen out.

1529
02:12:19,522 --> 02:12:21,604
My hearing sensors no
longer detect the...

1530
02:12:21,893 --> 02:12:22,919
Exact.

1531
02:12:29,072 --> 02:12:31,395
Where did the crystal
creatures go?

1532
02:12:37,129 --> 02:12:38,129
Follow me.

1533
02:12:42,616 --> 02:12:44,499
Why do they look at me?

1534
02:12:44,711 --> 02:12:46,132
Follow it.

1535
02:12:57,734 --> 02:13:00,057
If we have the mark below,
they must be somewhere.

1536
02:13:00,342 --> 02:13:01,677
Keep looking for ways of life.

1537
02:13:11,542 --> 02:13:12,937
Over here.

1538
02:13:17,589 --> 02:13:19,075
I see them! Chewie, there!

1539
02:13:32,730 --> 02:13:33,730
Do not.

1540
02:13:33,844 --> 02:13:35,565
No no.

1541
02:13:38,931 --> 02:13:39,931
Do not!

1542
02:13:52,107 --> 02:13:53,986
Lifting rocks.

1543
02:14:33,640 --> 02:14:36,066
I failed you, Ben.

1544
02:14:36,968 --> 02:14:37,662
Sorry.

1545
02:14:37,918 --> 02:14:39,259
I am sure that it is!

1546
02:14:40,496 --> 02:14:42,469
The Resistance is dead.

1547
02:14:42,675 --> 02:14:44,049
The war finished.

1548
02:14:44,417 --> 02:14:46,289
And when I kill you...

1549
02:14:46,510 --> 02:14:48,950
I will have killed
the last Jedi.

1550
02:14:49,152 --> 02:14:50,159
Amazing.

1551
02:14:50,808 --> 02:14:53,277
Every word you just said...

1552
02:14:53,587 --> 02:14:54,587
It was wrong.

1553
02:14:56,856 --> 02:14:59,878
The Rebellion was reborn today.

1554
02:15:02,113 --> 02:15:03,909
War...

1555
02:15:04,241 --> 02:15:05,779
It just starts.

1556
02:15:07,129 --> 02:15:10,821
And I will not be the last Jedi.

1557
02:15:50,311 --> 02:15:54,558
I will destroy her... to you...

1558
02:15:54,775 --> 02:15:56,161
and everything.

1559
02:16:00,172 --> 02:16:01,172
Do not.

1560
02:16:02,249 --> 02:16:05,341
Defeat me with anger and I
will always be with you.

1561
02:16:08,095 --> 02:16:10,141
As your father is.

1562
02:16:59,280 --> 02:17:00,280
Do not.

1563
02:17:04,440 --> 02:17:06,412
See you, boy.

1564
02:17:20,034 --> 02:17:21,312
Do not!

1565
02:19:58,540 --> 02:19:59,236
C'ai!

1566
02:19:59,495 --> 02:20:00,645
Is a very good friend.

1567
02:20:01,805 --> 02:20:02,805
Chewie!

1568
02:20:04,776 --> 02:20:06,546
Looks good.

1569
02:20:07,043 --> 02:20:08,064
It was crazy, man.

1570
02:20:09,571 --> 02:20:10,822
- Hello.
- Hello.

1571
02:20:11,620 --> 02:20:12,620
I'm Poe.

1572
02:20:13,504 --> 02:20:14,504
King.

1573
02:20:14,848 --> 02:20:15,848
I know.

1574
02:20:28,087 --> 02:20:29,813
I have a contact
in the Outer Rim.

1575
02:20:30,132 --> 02:20:31,325
It is very possible.

1576
02:20:41,655 --> 02:20:43,156
Luke is dead.

1577
02:20:44,032 --> 02:20:45,373
I felt it.

1578
02:20:46,043 --> 02:20:48,470
But it was neither sadness nor pain.
It was...

1579
02:20:49,002 --> 02:20:51,425
peace and intention.

1580
02:20:52,376 --> 02:20:53,710
I felt it too.

1581
02:20:56,346 --> 02:20:59,326
How do we build a
Rebellion with this?

1582
02:21:03,636 --> 02:21:06,443
We have everything we need.

1583
02:21:25,884 --> 02:21:29,527
Luke Skywalker... Jedi Master.
