00:00:16,548 --> 00:00:17,798
(suspenseful militaristic music)

2
00:00:17,798 --> 00:00:20,715
(airplane buzzing)

3
00:00:24,137 --> 00:00:26,963
(explosion booming)

4
00:00:26,963 --> 00:00:31,046
(suspenseful militaristic music)

5
00:00:46,523 --> 00:00:48,758
Captain, I just spotted a platoon.

6
00:00:48,758 --> 00:00:51,892
They've got an MG 42
nest right over the hill.

7
00:00:51,892 --> 00:00:54,431
Alright men, here's the situation,

8
00:00:54,431 --> 00:00:57,798
Preacher I want you to take
Simpson through the woods,

9
00:00:57,798 --> 00:01:00,338
come around, I want you to
flank them from the rear.

10
00:01:00,338 --> 00:01:02,392
Richie, you're with me.

11
00:01:02,392 --> 00:01:03,602
Right.

12
00:01:03,602 --> 00:01:07,861
Underwood I want you to find
yourself a nice pretty spot,

13
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:09,482
you cover us.

14
00:01:09,482 --> 00:01:11,149
Alright men let's move out.

15
00:01:11,149 --> 00:01:11,982
Yes sir.

16
00:01:15,571 --> 00:01:18,321
(birds chirping)

17
00:01:42,980 --> 00:01:47,063
(speaking in a foreign language)

18
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:59,284
(guns firing)

19
00:02:03,776 --> 00:02:04,975
(shouting in a foreign language)

20
00:02:04,975 --> 00:02:07,475
(guns firing)

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:13,833
(groaning)

22
00:02:13,833 --> 00:02:16,333
(guns firing)

23
00:02:18,579 --> 00:02:20,036
(shouting in a foreign language)

24
00:02:20,036 --> 00:02:22,536
(guns firing)

25
00:02:34,721 --> 00:02:37,554
(unnerving music)

26
00:02:40,119 --> 00:02:42,249
- You boys alright?
- Yeah.

27
00:02:42,249 --> 00:02:43,082
(guns firing)

28
00:02:43,082 --> 00:02:46,858
(growling)
(guns firing)

29
00:02:46,858 --> 00:02:48,696
[Man] He won't go down.

30
00:02:48,696 --> 00:02:50,779
Underwood take him out!

31
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,097
(guns firing)
(unnerving music)

32
00:03:12,814 --> 00:03:14,676
What the hell is that thing?

33
00:03:14,676 --> 00:03:17,413
He took two head shots
before he went down.

34
00:03:17,413 --> 00:03:18,725
(unnerving music)

35
00:03:18,725 --> 00:03:20,086
(growling)

36
00:03:20,086 --> 00:03:23,669
(creepy atmospheric music)

37
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:33,915
(gun firing)

38
00:03:33,915 --> 00:03:37,498
(creepy atmospheric music)

39
00:03:43,348 --> 00:03:44,325
(gun firing)

40
00:03:44,325 --> 00:03:48,492
(screaming)
(guns firing)

41
00:03:51,804 --> 00:03:55,387
(creepy atmospheric music)

42
00:04:02,282 --> 00:04:05,199
(airplane buzzing)

43
00:04:06,692 --> 00:04:09,465
(gun firing)

44
00:04:09,465 --> 00:04:13,048
(creepy atmospheric music)

45
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,754
(heavy breathing)

46
00:04:22,108 --> 00:04:24,608
(guns firing)

47
00:04:37,623 --> 00:04:40,259
(screaming)

48
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:43,842
(creepy atmospheric music)

49
00:04:57,693 --> 00:05:00,943
(electricity sparking)

50
00:05:02,621 --> 00:05:06,204
(creepy atmospheric music)

51
00:05:14,366 --> 00:05:16,866
(guns firing)

52
00:05:19,767 --> 00:05:23,350
(creepy atmospheric music)

53
00:05:50,073 --> 00:05:52,454
(guns firing)

54
00:05:52,454 --> 00:05:54,908
(screaming)

55
00:05:54,908 --> 00:05:58,491
(creepy atmospheric music)

56
00:06:02,581 --> 00:06:06,748
(guns firing)
(suspenseful music)

57
00:06:16,020 --> 00:06:18,430
I thought you said there were
only three or four of them.

58
00:06:18,430 --> 00:06:19,637
That's what Fredric told me.

59
00:06:19,637 --> 00:06:20,752
Dammit Simpson.

60
00:06:20,752 --> 00:06:22,584
They must have snuck in more last night.

61
00:06:22,584 --> 00:06:24,917
Armstrong change of plans.

62
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:29,216
There's gotta be about 10 Germans

63
00:06:29,216 --> 00:06:30,951
in that gun placement up there.

64
00:06:30,951 --> 00:06:32,813
I need those guys dead yesterday.

65
00:06:32,813 --> 00:06:34,247
Simpson, take Rueber...

66
00:06:34,247 --> 00:06:35,603
(explosion booming)

67
00:06:35,603 --> 00:06:37,343
(groaning)

68
00:06:37,343 --> 00:06:38,696
Take Rueber and Underwood

69
00:06:38,696 --> 00:06:40,366
and see if you can enter from the side.

70
00:06:40,366 --> 00:06:41,831
Don't let them see you.

71
00:06:41,831 --> 00:06:43,974
Armstrong you see here
and get it from the front.

72
00:06:43,974 --> 00:06:46,031
Here you're gonna need this.

73
00:06:46,031 --> 00:06:47,518
I'm gonna take Reese and Jackson,

74
00:06:47,518 --> 00:06:49,061
we're gonna hit them with some grenades.

75
00:06:49,061 --> 00:06:51,486
Nobody move until you start covering fire.

76
00:06:51,486 --> 00:06:52,884
Let's go fellas.

77
00:06:52,884 --> 00:06:57,051
(suspenseful music)
(guns firing)

78
00:07:01,911 --> 00:07:04,207
Get ready for some fun boys.

79
00:07:04,207 --> 00:07:06,203
Get those grenades ready, in your hand.

80
00:07:06,203 --> 00:07:10,370
(suspenseful music)
(guns firing)

81
00:07:19,546 --> 00:07:20,406
What's the word?

82
00:07:20,406 --> 00:07:22,906
(guns firing)

83
00:07:26,142 --> 00:07:29,120
- Underwood.
- Hang in there Underwood.

84
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:30,095
Underwood.

85
00:07:30,095 --> 00:07:33,331
(guns firing)

86
00:07:33,331 --> 00:07:34,581
Pull my finger.

87
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:37,863
Alright, it's a passing fire.

88
00:07:37,863 --> 00:07:39,723
- Come on.
- On me.

89
00:07:39,723 --> 00:07:40,556
Now!

90
00:07:40,556 --> 00:07:42,777
(guns firing)
(suspenseful music)

91
00:07:42,777 --> 00:07:44,086
Showtime, move.

92
00:07:44,086 --> 00:07:48,253
(suspenseful music)
(guns firing)

93
00:08:02,496 --> 00:08:05,304
(screaming)

94
00:08:05,304 --> 00:08:09,471
(guns firing)
(suspenseful music)

95
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:20,261
(screaming)

96
00:08:20,261 --> 00:08:23,261
(suspenseful music)

97
00:08:25,253 --> 00:08:26,086
Reese!

98
00:08:27,489 --> 00:08:29,497
(explosion booming)

99
00:08:29,497 --> 00:08:32,552
(guns firing)

100
00:08:32,552 --> 00:08:34,209
God dammit.

101
00:08:34,209 --> 00:08:36,858
(guns firing)

102
00:08:36,858 --> 00:08:39,858
(suspenseful music)

103
00:08:41,358 --> 00:08:42,840
Captain!

104
00:08:42,840 --> 00:08:47,007
(guns firing)
(suspenseful music)

105
00:08:50,307 --> 00:08:52,133
(explosion booming)

106
00:08:52,133 --> 00:08:55,133
(suspenseful music)

107
00:08:59,499 --> 00:09:03,666
(guns firing)
(suspenseful music)

108
00:09:09,318 --> 00:09:11,401
Cease fire, cease fire!

109
00:09:12,827 --> 00:09:16,558
I think they've had enough Simpson.

110
00:09:16,558 --> 00:09:18,752
Griff, Reese and Jackson
go down, go check on 'em.

111
00:09:18,752 --> 00:09:19,585
[Man] Yes sir.

112
00:09:19,585 --> 00:09:21,227
Simpson,

113
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:24,386
what the hell were you thinking?

114
00:09:24,386 --> 00:09:26,790
I didn't like the way
that one was shooting at me.

115
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:27,920
(laughing)

116
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:31,087
Funny, jackass, check him for intel.

117
00:09:40,574 --> 00:09:43,157
(somber music)

118
00:10:29,222 --> 00:10:32,116
Lieutenant Schmidt reporting sir.

119
00:10:32,116 --> 00:10:33,283
Have a seat.

120
00:10:38,425 --> 00:10:42,592
I've just been reviewing
your after action report.

121
00:10:44,975 --> 00:10:46,542
According to you,

122
00:10:46,542 --> 00:10:50,709
you ran into something
extraordinary on your patrol.

123
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:56,169
No one else in your squad was
able to confirm your report.

124
00:10:56,169 --> 00:10:57,684
I can't force anyone
else to come forward

125
00:10:57,684 --> 00:11:00,184
with the truth of what we saw.

126
00:11:01,376 --> 00:11:04,282
In your report you stated that you sent

127
00:11:04,282 --> 00:11:07,615
a Private Bagwell and a Private Stamper.

128
00:11:09,112 --> 00:11:12,376
"I had to assess the situation."

129
00:11:12,376 --> 00:11:13,209
Yes sir.

130
00:11:14,843 --> 00:11:18,093
Why didn't you take the entire squad?

131
00:11:19,679 --> 00:11:21,596
It was a mistake sir.

132
00:11:30,326 --> 00:11:31,704
I'm going to reassign you.

133
00:11:31,704 --> 00:11:35,169
You'll report to a Captain Mitchell.

134
00:11:35,169 --> 00:11:36,002
Yes sir.

135
00:11:36,924 --> 00:11:37,973
That'll be all.

136
00:11:37,973 --> 00:11:40,723
(dramatic music)

137
00:11:57,505 --> 00:12:00,078
[Gary] You must be Lieutenant Schmidt?

138
00:12:00,078 --> 00:12:01,776
Sergeant.

139
00:12:01,776 --> 00:12:02,609
So,

140
00:12:04,567 --> 00:12:06,695
being dropped behind enemy lines?

141
00:12:06,695 --> 00:12:08,445
That's what I hear.

142
00:12:10,314 --> 00:12:11,910
Is it true if we make
it back from this mission

143
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:15,519
we'll be reassigned to our old units?

144
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,390
That is affirmative,

145
00:12:17,390 --> 00:12:20,640
everybody's record will be wiped clean.

146
00:12:21,596 --> 00:12:25,345
Just so you know not
all of us are bad guys.

147
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:28,742
Right, just a group of misfits.

148
00:12:28,742 --> 00:12:31,159
Well it can get tough here.

149
00:12:32,055 --> 00:12:34,289
Some of the fellas call
it the gray bar unit.

150
00:12:34,289 --> 00:12:35,477
Meaning?

151
00:12:35,477 --> 00:12:36,310
[Gary] Meaning a lot of these guys

152
00:12:36,310 --> 00:12:38,842
spent time behind gray bars.

153
00:12:38,842 --> 00:12:39,675
And you?

154
00:12:46,191 --> 00:12:47,024
Great.

155
00:12:50,502 --> 00:12:53,085
Alright, think what you want.

156
00:12:55,384 --> 00:12:59,217
You haven't met Captain
Mitchell yet have you?

157
00:13:00,763 --> 00:13:03,513
(dramatic music)

158
00:13:06,711 --> 00:13:09,711
(airplanes droning)

159
00:13:12,029 --> 00:13:14,544
Alright listen up men.

160
00:13:14,544 --> 00:13:17,960
We're hitting a weapon's
facility near car trains.

161
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:21,363
What kind of weapons facility?

162
00:13:21,363 --> 00:13:22,613
I didn't ask.

163
00:13:23,691 --> 00:13:25,923
Now we're landing in occupied France.

164
00:13:25,923 --> 00:13:28,064
We're gonna be behind enemy lines.

165
00:13:28,064 --> 00:13:30,397
We need to move fast, quick.

166
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:35,224
When we get back no more time in the brig.

167
00:13:35,224 --> 00:13:38,141
(artillery firing)

168
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,121
(explosion booming)

169
00:13:41,121 --> 00:13:44,116
What are the odds we even make it back?

170
00:13:44,116 --> 00:13:45,699
One in a hundred.

171
00:13:46,934 --> 00:13:48,819
Grab your gear.

172
00:13:48,819 --> 00:13:51,819
(engine sputtering)

173
00:13:54,323 --> 00:13:56,022
[Man] Move, move, move.

174
00:13:56,022 --> 00:13:59,389
[Mitchell] Grab your
stuff, we gotta bail.

175
00:13:59,389 --> 00:14:04,205
We're hit, we gotta go, go,
move it, move it, move it.

176
00:14:04,205 --> 00:14:07,205
(suspenseful music)

177
00:14:18,449 --> 00:14:21,366
Get into the tree line, go go go.

178
00:14:25,291 --> 00:14:26,124
(laughing)

179
00:14:26,124 --> 00:14:30,291
[Man] Move guys quick or your
gonna get your ass shot off.

180
00:14:44,972 --> 00:14:46,749
Where is everybody?

181
00:14:46,749 --> 00:14:48,909
The whole platoon's
probably scattered for miles.

182
00:14:48,909 --> 00:14:51,834
Once the planes got hit
people just started jumping.

183
00:14:51,834 --> 00:14:52,807
Are we going to abort sir?

184
00:14:52,807 --> 00:14:54,429
Hell no we're gonna finish this mission.

185
00:14:54,429 --> 00:14:56,330
Yeah, I don't want to go back to jail.

186
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:57,626
[Schmidt] We don't have the numbers.

187
00:14:57,626 --> 00:14:58,921
We're gonna head out to our objective

188
00:14:58,921 --> 00:15:00,793
and pick up as many of my
men along the way as we can.

189
00:15:00,793 --> 00:15:01,856
We don't even know where we are.

190
00:15:01,856 --> 00:15:05,356
Well let's figure out where we are then.

191
00:15:07,051 --> 00:15:10,569
- We're here.
- Nowhere near our drop zone.

192
00:15:10,569 --> 00:15:12,295
We could head back.

193
00:15:12,295 --> 00:15:14,739
Two miles southeast, get back
on track over that bridge,

194
00:15:14,739 --> 00:15:16,713
we can go back northeast toward the line.

195
00:15:16,713 --> 00:15:18,445
There's a sign back
there that says Versailles.

196
00:15:18,445 --> 00:15:19,860
It's Versailles.

197
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:20,824
What?

198
00:15:20,824 --> 00:15:22,481
That's how the French pronounce it.

199
00:15:22,481 --> 00:15:23,314
Bullshit.

200
00:15:23,314 --> 00:15:24,667
He's right, it's Versailles.

201
00:15:24,667 --> 00:15:26,793
(laughing)

202
00:15:26,793 --> 00:15:29,003
Shut up all of you.

203
00:15:29,003 --> 00:15:31,232
College boy, think you
know everything don't you?

204
00:15:31,232 --> 00:15:32,065
Once the bullets start flying

205
00:15:32,065 --> 00:15:34,248
you're gonna wish you did a
hell of a lot more running.

206
00:15:34,248 --> 00:15:37,756
Let's move out, this
ain't a grammar lesson.

207
00:15:37,756 --> 00:15:38,589
Imbecile.

208
00:15:38,589 --> 00:15:42,959
Like I said stay out of
Mitchell's way and you'll be fine.

209
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:45,126
- Fine, thanks.
- Let's go.

210
00:15:46,799 --> 00:15:49,799
(suspenseful music)

211
00:16:27,387 --> 00:16:29,674
(flies buzzing)

212
00:16:29,674 --> 00:16:32,674
(suspenseful music)

213
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:09,159
Hey I found someone!

214
00:17:13,940 --> 00:17:15,857
What the hell's this?

215
00:17:17,146 --> 00:17:18,313
He's burned.

216
00:17:19,365 --> 00:17:21,657
What happened here?

217
00:17:21,657 --> 00:17:24,457
He must've made it
out of plane after us.

218
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:27,124
Answer me, what happened here?

219
00:17:30,646 --> 00:17:32,479
Got stuck in a tree.

220
00:17:34,902 --> 00:17:36,485
German patrol came.

221
00:17:37,968 --> 00:17:42,135
They pulled me down and then
they started to beat me.

222
00:17:45,362 --> 00:17:46,644
I wouldn't tell them
what they wanted to know

223
00:17:46,644 --> 00:17:48,811
so they just kept beating.

224
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:52,528
I had no idea what this was.

225
00:17:56,680 --> 00:18:00,180
A man was walking on all fours like a dog.

226
00:18:05,632 --> 00:18:07,215
There was this guy.

227
00:18:08,750 --> 00:18:12,964
He wasn't even ranked in the German army.

228
00:18:12,964 --> 00:18:14,964
They were afraid of him.

229
00:18:21,556 --> 00:18:22,389
He left.

230
00:18:28,378 --> 00:18:30,339
That's when things went wrong.

231
00:18:30,339 --> 00:18:33,172
(unnerving music)

232
00:18:45,174 --> 00:18:49,341
(growling)
(guns firing)

233
00:18:58,566 --> 00:19:00,816
(thumping)

234
00:19:02,219 --> 00:19:04,102
(gun firing)

235
00:19:04,102 --> 00:19:07,102
(slicing whooshing)

236
00:19:09,004 --> 00:19:11,837
(unnerving music)

237
00:19:15,482 --> 00:19:17,732
(grunting)

238
00:19:23,268 --> 00:19:24,601
He got them all.

239
00:19:27,132 --> 00:19:29,132
Got them all one by one.

240
00:19:31,811 --> 00:19:34,540
So all there was left was me.

241
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,373
(unnerving music)

242
00:19:44,386 --> 00:19:48,553
Do you have any idea how
ridiculous that sounds?

243
00:19:52,180 --> 00:19:53,013
Watch him.

244
00:20:01,911 --> 00:20:02,850
What do you think?

245
00:20:02,850 --> 00:20:05,425
Section eight for sure.

246
00:20:05,425 --> 00:20:07,744
Do you have any other
explanation for what did this?

247
00:20:07,744 --> 00:20:09,117
Look I've been hunting
in Kentucky enough times

248
00:20:09,117 --> 00:20:10,824
to know that a mountain lion or a wolf

249
00:20:10,824 --> 00:20:12,768
can get pretty damn big.

250
00:20:12,768 --> 00:20:14,020
People exaggerate.

251
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:15,398
And no way it happened the way he said,

252
00:20:15,398 --> 00:20:16,571
this guy's crazy.

253
00:20:16,571 --> 00:20:18,696
Let's get him up and get
the hell out of here.

254
00:20:18,696 --> 00:20:19,613
Let's go.

255
00:20:26,818 --> 00:20:30,068
Get up soldier we still have a mission.

256
00:20:30,934 --> 00:20:31,767
Can't.

257
00:20:36,815 --> 00:20:38,809
Get up you coward.

258
00:20:38,809 --> 00:20:40,245
Look he's in shock.

259
00:20:40,245 --> 00:20:43,478
He's not gonna do us any good.

260
00:20:43,478 --> 00:20:47,311
Fine, leave him, take
his ammo and let's go.

261
00:20:50,131 --> 00:20:52,548
Gary give him your canteen.

262
00:20:56,293 --> 00:20:58,043
Head west if you can.

263
00:21:05,854 --> 00:21:08,854
(suspenseful music)

264
00:21:18,260 --> 00:21:19,629
[Mitchell] See anything?

265
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:20,953
Small graveyard.

266
00:21:20,953 --> 00:21:22,255
It's pretty clear.

267
00:21:22,255 --> 00:21:23,922
What do you think?

268
00:21:27,256 --> 00:21:28,753
I don't like it.

269
00:21:28,753 --> 00:21:30,339
There could be an enemy
squad in those trees

270
00:21:30,339 --> 00:21:33,795
or there could be no one for miles.

271
00:21:33,795 --> 00:21:36,924
Last intel report says we're
just outside the village.

272
00:21:36,924 --> 00:21:38,019
We cut across this clearing

273
00:21:38,019 --> 00:21:39,745
we're gonna save ourselves hours.

274
00:21:39,745 --> 00:21:42,162
Gary get you ass up here now.

275
00:21:44,323 --> 00:21:48,715
Alright listen up, hey
hey, (whistling) over here.

276
00:21:48,715 --> 00:21:50,305
You and college boy here follow these two

277
00:21:50,305 --> 00:21:54,243
to that point directly
over there you got it?

278
00:21:54,243 --> 00:21:56,410
Line up two by two fellas.

279
00:21:57,250 --> 00:22:00,250
(suspenseful music)

280
00:22:24,441 --> 00:22:25,873
Fall back, fall back!

281
00:22:25,873 --> 00:22:30,040
(guns firing)
(suspenseful music)

282
00:22:36,468 --> 00:22:37,961
Covering fire!

283
00:22:37,961 --> 00:22:40,055
(guns firing)

284
00:22:40,055 --> 00:22:40,888
[Man] Brick's down!

285
00:22:40,888 --> 00:22:45,055
(guns firing)
(suspenseful music)

286
00:22:59,011 --> 00:23:01,160
Try to flank them from the rear!

287
00:23:01,160 --> 00:23:02,495
We're cut off!

288
00:23:02,495 --> 00:23:06,662
(guns firing)
(suspenseful music)

289
00:23:08,109 --> 00:23:11,311
Sergeant on me, move, go now!

290
00:23:11,311 --> 00:23:15,478
(guns firing)
(suspenseful music)

291
00:23:38,733 --> 00:23:39,566
Grenade!

292
00:23:41,458 --> 00:23:42,443
Do it now.

293
00:23:42,443 --> 00:23:45,410
(suspenseful music)

294
00:23:45,410 --> 00:23:47,101
(explosions booming)

295
00:23:47,101 --> 00:23:48,851
Go, fall back, go.

296
00:23:48,851 --> 00:23:53,018
(guns firing)
(suspenseful music)

297
00:24:05,224 --> 00:24:07,332
(groaning)

298
00:24:07,332 --> 00:24:09,832
(guns firing)

299
00:24:11,899 --> 00:24:13,467
(explosions booming)
(screaming)

300
00:24:13,467 --> 00:24:17,634
(guns firing)
(suspenseful music)

301
00:24:39,491 --> 00:24:42,491
(explosion booming)

302
00:24:43,671 --> 00:24:46,171
(guns firing)

303
00:24:50,920 --> 00:24:53,920
(explosion booming)

304
00:25:02,140 --> 00:25:02,973
Over here.

305
00:25:27,587 --> 00:25:31,670
(speaking in a foreign language)

306
00:25:56,634 --> 00:25:58,539
I don't get it why did they leave?

307
00:25:58,539 --> 00:26:02,372
I don't know, doesn't
make any sense at all.

308
00:26:12,593 --> 00:26:13,807
There's a sign back there.

309
00:26:13,807 --> 00:26:16,089
I'm gonna go check it out.

310
00:26:16,089 --> 00:26:16,934
What does it say?

311
00:26:16,934 --> 00:26:19,069
Give me a second.

312
00:26:19,069 --> 00:26:22,359
Gary, forget it, we
gotta get out of here now.

313
00:26:22,359 --> 00:26:24,109
We keep heading east.

314
00:26:24,997 --> 00:26:27,997
(suspenseful music)

315
00:27:10,972 --> 00:27:11,805
(growling)

316
00:27:11,805 --> 00:27:13,433
What was that?

317
00:27:13,433 --> 00:27:16,740
(suspenseful music)

318
00:27:16,740 --> 00:27:18,941
(growling)

319
00:27:18,941 --> 00:27:20,108
What was that?

320
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:23,712
We don't know.

321
00:27:24,888 --> 00:27:26,555
Let's keep moving.

322
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:31,443
(suspenseful music)

323
00:27:31,443 --> 00:27:34,769
(growling)
What's wrong?

324
00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:36,936
I thought I saw someone.

325
00:27:40,022 --> 00:27:42,355
Hey, we gotta keep moving.

326
00:27:43,644 --> 00:27:46,644
(suspenseful music)

327
00:28:51,051 --> 00:28:52,258
We got two woman.

328
00:28:52,258 --> 00:28:53,228
Any sign of any men?

329
00:28:53,228 --> 00:28:54,061
Husband, brother?

330
00:28:54,061 --> 00:28:55,571
No, they look like they're alone.

331
00:28:55,571 --> 00:28:57,590
Alright, we can hide
out here for tonight.

332
00:28:57,590 --> 00:28:58,665
But the barn had the road in plain view

333
00:28:58,665 --> 00:28:59,498
it makes more sense for us...

334
00:28:59,498 --> 00:29:01,436
We're going in this house.

335
00:29:01,436 --> 00:29:03,974
Sir we don't have to do this.

336
00:29:03,974 --> 00:29:05,718
We're going in that house,

337
00:29:05,718 --> 00:29:08,029
and you're the only one
here who speaks French

338
00:29:08,029 --> 00:29:09,909
so unless you want me to kill them

339
00:29:09,909 --> 00:29:12,528
over some silly little misunderstanding,

340
00:29:12,528 --> 00:29:15,389
well I think you'll go in there with us.

341
00:29:15,389 --> 00:29:16,963
Now let's get this over with shall we?

342
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:19,130
Hell, it's just one night.

343
00:29:27,999 --> 00:29:29,053
(speaking in a foreign language)

344
00:29:29,053 --> 00:29:31,858
(laughing)

345
00:29:31,858 --> 00:29:32,691
Get back!

346
00:29:32,691 --> 00:29:36,526
(shouting over each other)

347
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:38,967
Gary ask them if there's anyone else here.

348
00:29:38,967 --> 00:29:40,077
(speaking in a foreign language)

349
00:29:40,077 --> 00:29:41,805
Ask them if there's anyone else here.

350
00:29:41,805 --> 00:29:45,666
(speaking in foreign language)

351
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:46,831
She says there's no one else.

352
00:29:46,831 --> 00:29:48,645
She says there's no one else!

353
00:29:48,645 --> 00:29:50,309
- Dimm.
- Yeah?

354
00:29:50,309 --> 00:29:51,831
You go check the rest of the house.

355
00:29:51,831 --> 00:29:53,081
[Dimm] Right.

356
00:30:02,303 --> 00:30:04,521
If you're lying,

357
00:30:04,521 --> 00:30:06,521
hey, I'll kill you both.

358
00:30:12,201 --> 00:30:14,928
Everything's going to be okay.

359
00:30:14,928 --> 00:30:17,095
(sighing)

360
00:30:19,695 --> 00:30:21,520
Ask them where the
man in that picture is.

361
00:30:21,520 --> 00:30:25,384
(speaking in a foreign language)

362
00:30:25,384 --> 00:30:26,511
Don't lie to me, I want to know

363
00:30:26,511 --> 00:30:28,164
where the man in that
picture is right now.

364
00:30:28,164 --> 00:30:29,164
(speaking in a foreign language)

365
00:30:29,164 --> 00:30:30,439
She says it's her brother.

366
00:30:30,439 --> 00:30:31,958
The Germans took him, he's dead.

367
00:30:31,958 --> 00:30:33,581
Look you don't have
to do things this way.

368
00:30:33,581 --> 00:30:36,292
They hate the Germans
just as much as we do.

369
00:30:36,292 --> 00:30:38,542
It's all clear, now what?

370
00:30:40,163 --> 00:30:42,496
(smooching)

371
00:30:48,104 --> 00:30:52,187
(speaking in a foreign language)

372
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:56,619
(suspenseful music)

373
00:31:04,737 --> 00:31:07,154
Let's figure out where we are.

374
00:31:07,154 --> 00:31:10,071
(fingers snapping)

375
00:31:16,121 --> 00:31:19,505
Alright we're about seven
miles from our objective.

376
00:31:19,505 --> 00:31:20,338
Due south.

377
00:31:22,145 --> 00:31:24,349
Yes we, if we leave by day break

378
00:31:24,349 --> 00:31:28,180
we should be able to get there by midday.

379
00:31:28,180 --> 00:31:32,013
Let's just hope we can
avoid any more patrols.

380
00:31:33,252 --> 00:31:34,085
You bet.

381
00:31:35,745 --> 00:31:38,812
Why don't you go take the first watch huh?

382
00:31:38,812 --> 00:31:41,155
You, go get some sleep will you?

383
00:31:41,155 --> 00:31:43,988
I'll wake you when it's your turn.

384
00:32:01,281 --> 00:32:02,527
I'm gonna take the first watch.

385
00:32:02,527 --> 00:32:04,360
You get some shut eye.

386
00:32:18,264 --> 00:32:21,097
(unnerving music)

387
00:32:37,908 --> 00:32:40,158
(growling)

388
00:32:55,849 --> 00:32:59,761
[Gary] Sergeant, what
the hell are you doing?

389
00:32:59,761 --> 00:33:01,415
Lay off him will you?

390
00:33:01,415 --> 00:33:02,897
I think we've earned a little fun.

391
00:33:02,897 --> 00:33:03,730
No stop!

392
00:33:07,074 --> 00:33:08,888
Don't do this.

393
00:33:08,888 --> 00:33:12,415
Since when did you
grow a conscience, huh?

394
00:33:12,415 --> 00:33:16,092
I'm not asking you to do anything
you've never done before.

395
00:33:16,092 --> 00:33:19,425
Just get outside and look the other way.

396
00:33:24,921 --> 00:33:27,171
(thumping)

397
00:33:28,245 --> 00:33:32,412
You know you make it real
hard for me to be a nice guy.

398
00:33:33,358 --> 00:33:34,441
Get in there.

399
00:33:38,741 --> 00:33:39,876
Come on.

400
00:33:39,876 --> 00:33:42,876
(suspenseful music)

401
00:33:55,517 --> 00:33:58,209
What happened to your head?

402
00:33:58,209 --> 00:34:02,292
Captain Mitchell and I
got into a disagreement.

403
00:34:04,022 --> 00:34:05,318
Did you see anything?

404
00:34:05,318 --> 00:34:06,151
Nothing.

405
00:34:06,990 --> 00:34:08,466
It's sort of eerie.

406
00:34:08,466 --> 00:34:11,104
There's no life for miles.

407
00:34:11,104 --> 00:34:12,465
(growling)

408
00:34:12,465 --> 00:34:14,082
(suspenseful music)

409
00:34:14,082 --> 00:34:16,789
Things just keep getting better.

410
00:34:16,789 --> 00:34:20,016
What was that?
(growling)

411
00:34:20,016 --> 00:34:22,849
(unnerving music)

412
00:34:24,392 --> 00:34:25,225
A wolf.

413
00:34:27,572 --> 00:34:29,822
(growling)

414
00:34:33,512 --> 00:34:36,240
(unnerving music)

415
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,490
(growling)

416
00:35:07,334 --> 00:35:10,167
(unnerving music)

417
00:35:47,249 --> 00:35:49,499
(growling)

418
00:35:59,901 --> 00:36:03,484
I got next watch,
your turn for some fun.

419
00:36:07,382 --> 00:36:10,632
What's the matter don't you like girls?

420
00:36:14,006 --> 00:36:16,589
(somber music)

421
00:36:26,661 --> 00:36:28,045
(chattering)

422
00:36:28,045 --> 00:36:29,184
I need you right in front of me.

423
00:36:29,184 --> 00:36:30,068
[Man] Don't worry.

424
00:36:30,068 --> 00:36:31,401
- Alright?
- Yep.

425
00:36:36,315 --> 00:36:38,966
(speaking in a foreign language)

426
00:36:38,966 --> 00:36:40,269
She's got a gun, wait wait wait.

427
00:36:40,269 --> 00:36:41,251
(speaking in a foreign language)

428
00:36:41,251 --> 00:36:42,729
- Mademoiselle...
- What are you doing? Don't!

429
00:36:42,729 --> 00:36:44,866
Wait wait, whoa wait wait, tell her to,

430
00:36:44,866 --> 00:36:46,466
wait wait...
(shouting over each other)

431
00:36:46,466 --> 00:36:47,636
(gun firing)

432
00:36:47,636 --> 00:36:49,303
(shouting)

433
00:36:49,303 --> 00:36:52,303
(suspenseful music)

434
00:37:11,445 --> 00:37:13,388
What the hell did you just do?

435
00:37:13,388 --> 00:37:14,221
Forget her.

436
00:37:14,221 --> 00:37:16,159
You just killed an innocent girl.

437
00:37:16,159 --> 00:37:18,528
No one is innocent.

438
00:37:18,528 --> 00:37:21,528
(suspenseful music)

439
00:38:51,934 --> 00:38:53,648
(distant gun firing)

440
00:38:53,648 --> 00:38:56,398
(dramatic music)

441
00:39:02,834 --> 00:39:04,348
(distant gun firing)

442
00:39:04,348 --> 00:39:07,098
(dramatic music)

443
00:39:16,216 --> 00:39:18,128
Was that part of the mission?

444
00:39:18,128 --> 00:39:19,481
Excuse me?

445
00:39:19,481 --> 00:39:21,898
You know killing that girl?

446
00:39:26,329 --> 00:39:27,897
What's your problem Lieutenant?

447
00:39:27,897 --> 00:39:29,382
No problem sir.

448
00:39:29,382 --> 00:39:30,215
I'm just trying to figure out

449
00:39:30,215 --> 00:39:31,475
what the hell happened back there.

450
00:39:31,475 --> 00:39:33,017
Simple.

451
00:39:33,017 --> 00:39:34,824
She tried to kill me.

452
00:39:34,824 --> 00:39:36,453
I was protecting myself.

453
00:39:36,453 --> 00:39:39,301
Right, and why was
she trying to kill you?

454
00:39:39,301 --> 00:39:40,372
What did you do to her?

455
00:39:40,372 --> 00:39:43,518
I don't have to tell you anything.

456
00:39:43,518 --> 00:39:44,351
You shouldn't have done it.

457
00:39:44,351 --> 00:39:47,599
- Shut your hole.
- What did you do?

458
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:49,640
She had a good time.

459
00:39:49,640 --> 00:39:50,473
When we get back...

460
00:39:50,473 --> 00:39:55,133
Oh you really think you're
gonna make it back huh?

461
00:39:55,133 --> 00:39:58,267
When we get back you're gonna pay.

462
00:39:58,267 --> 00:40:00,517
(laughing)

463
00:40:01,952 --> 00:40:04,339
Let's keep moving huh?

464
00:40:04,339 --> 00:40:07,089
(dramatic music)

465
00:40:16,355 --> 00:40:17,855
I saw my father,

466
00:40:20,190 --> 00:40:23,114
just for a second and
I ran right up to him

467
00:40:23,114 --> 00:40:26,125
and just blasted him as
hard as I could in the face.

468
00:40:26,125 --> 00:40:27,458
Man did he fall.

469
00:40:28,884 --> 00:40:31,385
I preceded to just beat
the hell out of him.

470
00:40:31,385 --> 00:40:33,968
Probably could have killed him.

471
00:40:35,403 --> 00:40:37,570
That's why I went to jail.

472
00:40:41,548 --> 00:40:45,519
Hey Schmidt, do you
want to know what I did?

473
00:40:45,519 --> 00:40:48,102
(somber music)

474
00:40:53,610 --> 00:40:58,385
A young man picked a real
bad day to get on my nerves.

475
00:40:58,385 --> 00:41:02,849
We got to fighting, I got
to pistol whipping him

476
00:41:02,849 --> 00:41:04,182
and it went off.

477
00:41:05,370 --> 00:41:06,703
Wasn't my fault,

478
00:41:08,814 --> 00:41:12,481
but they put me away
and threw away the key.

479
00:41:13,966 --> 00:41:17,794
Hell the way I see it
I did my men a favor.

480
00:41:17,794 --> 00:41:20,133
If things hadn't happened the way they did

481
00:41:20,133 --> 00:41:21,807
that goofy son of a bitch
would've been responsible

482
00:41:21,807 --> 00:41:23,625
for a lot more deaths than his own

483
00:41:23,625 --> 00:41:25,708
I can guarantee you that.

484
00:41:26,845 --> 00:41:30,345
Especially him being a Lieutenant and all.

485
00:41:34,921 --> 00:41:38,838
Sergeant Gary, so you
served in North Africa?

486
00:41:40,259 --> 00:41:41,338
Yeah.

487
00:41:41,338 --> 00:41:42,921
What was it like?

488
00:41:45,293 --> 00:41:46,960
Hot and miserable.

489
00:41:48,852 --> 00:41:51,975
Did you see a lot of action?

490
00:41:51,975 --> 00:41:53,543
Some.

491
00:41:53,543 --> 00:41:54,498
[Man] North Africa sounds like a breeze

492
00:41:54,498 --> 00:41:57,172
compared to the Pacific.

493
00:41:57,172 --> 00:41:59,500
Okay it wasn't a
vacation, men died there,

494
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,800
good men died there.

495
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,145
Not just from Italians or Germans,

496
00:42:04,145 --> 00:42:05,940
people died of thirst,

497
00:42:05,940 --> 00:42:08,330
they dropped off of starvation,

498
00:42:08,330 --> 00:42:09,997
they got lost in the sand.

499
00:42:09,997 --> 00:42:10,914
Lost huh?

500
00:42:12,874 --> 00:42:16,446
You know your Sergeant
used to be a Lieutenant?

501
00:42:16,446 --> 00:42:20,535
Went AWOL, tried to get
out on a section eight.

502
00:42:20,535 --> 00:42:23,422
Is that why they put you in this unit?

503
00:42:23,422 --> 00:42:26,864
Do you want to hear the whole story?

504
00:42:26,864 --> 00:42:28,447
I was in the 509th.

505
00:42:30,368 --> 00:42:34,535
There was a drop over Oran,
part of Operation Torch.

506
00:42:35,705 --> 00:42:38,018
(screaming)
(growling)

507
00:42:38,018 --> 00:42:41,654
Oh Jesus.
(screaming)

508
00:42:41,654 --> 00:42:42,972
Come on, let's move out.

509
00:42:42,972 --> 00:42:45,972
(suspenseful music)

510
00:42:49,528 --> 00:42:52,334
I suppose you think that's just
another wolf from Kentucky.

511
00:42:52,334 --> 00:42:54,285
I thought they only
eat birds and not us.

512
00:42:54,285 --> 00:42:55,702
Well it wasn't.

513
00:42:57,287 --> 00:42:58,634
We gotta find some water fast.

514
00:42:58,634 --> 00:42:59,467
[Man] Why?

515
00:42:59,467 --> 00:43:01,666
'Cause I think I know why it's after us.

516
00:43:01,666 --> 00:43:05,155
(suspenseful music)

517
00:43:05,155 --> 00:43:07,525
(growling)

518
00:43:07,525 --> 00:43:11,127
(suspenseful music)

519
00:43:11,127 --> 00:43:13,377
(growling)

520
00:43:19,117 --> 00:43:20,514
(clinking)

521
00:43:20,514 --> 00:43:22,764
(growling)

522
00:43:25,528 --> 00:43:27,861
(screaming)

523
00:43:31,032 --> 00:43:32,569
What are you doing?

524
00:43:32,569 --> 00:43:34,235
It's the blood, if we wash it off...

525
00:43:34,235 --> 00:43:35,667
No there's no time for that we gotta go.

526
00:43:35,667 --> 00:43:36,584
Where's your rifle?

527
00:43:36,584 --> 00:43:38,067
- Where's yours?
- It's back there.

528
00:43:38,067 --> 00:43:41,067
(suspenseful music)

529
00:43:42,135 --> 00:43:42,968
I'm empty.

530
00:43:44,128 --> 00:43:45,261
I have these.

531
00:43:45,261 --> 00:43:48,158
(growling)

532
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:48,991
Schmidt!

533
00:43:51,321 --> 00:43:55,071
Schmidt shoot him!
(growling)

534
00:43:56,121 --> 00:44:00,288
(tearing)
(screaming)

535
00:44:02,571 --> 00:44:06,362
Schmidt. (Screaming)

536
00:44:06,362 --> 00:44:08,779
(gun firing)

537
00:44:20,074 --> 00:44:21,741
Gary are you okay?

538
00:44:29,725 --> 00:44:32,725
(suspenseful music)

539
00:44:38,852 --> 00:44:41,745
(howling)

540
00:44:41,745 --> 00:44:43,995
(growling)

541
00:45:10,428 --> 00:45:12,963
Lieutenant Schmidt reporting sir.

542
00:45:12,963 --> 00:45:17,130
You seem to have a penchant
for reporting the unusual.

543
00:45:19,144 --> 00:45:21,076
If you want to ridicule me
sir I feel I've had enough.

544
00:45:21,076 --> 00:45:22,055
No one believes me so...

545
00:45:22,055 --> 00:45:22,972
Son, son.

546
00:45:24,888 --> 00:45:27,013
No one believed you then,

547
00:45:27,013 --> 00:45:29,675
but in the weeks since the
Office of of Strategic Services

548
00:45:29,675 --> 00:45:32,433
has compiled a list of similar reports.

549
00:45:32,433 --> 00:45:35,603
Reports that are hard to explain,

550
00:45:35,603 --> 00:45:37,384
and now with this new report from you

551
00:45:37,384 --> 00:45:41,551
and that of Sergeant Gary
along with his, condition.

552
00:45:43,194 --> 00:45:44,027
Yes sir.

553
00:45:45,173 --> 00:45:48,090
We have a problem, a big problem.

554
00:45:49,064 --> 00:45:50,856
Problem sir?

555
00:45:50,856 --> 00:45:54,619
We've intercepted a
communique en route to Berlin.

556
00:45:54,619 --> 00:45:57,836
Hitler is feeling the pressure
of the Allied advance.

557
00:45:57,836 --> 00:45:59,390
We've learned that he has scientists

558
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:03,056
working on secret weapons projects.

559
00:46:03,056 --> 00:46:04,768
I don't understand sir.

560
00:46:04,768 --> 00:46:07,077
As you know we've launched
operations to counter

561
00:46:07,077 --> 00:46:11,653
or retrieve intel on these
secret weapons projects

562
00:46:11,653 --> 00:46:16,603
like the last one you were
on with Captain Mitchell.

563
00:46:16,603 --> 00:46:19,074
Did anything come
from the other missions?

564
00:46:19,074 --> 00:46:21,149
They have elements in
common with your reports

565
00:46:21,149 --> 00:46:25,316
and something else, a German
by the name of Schaltur.

566
00:46:28,258 --> 00:46:30,502
We think he's the key,

567
00:46:30,502 --> 00:46:32,509
but we don't know if he's
being forced to do this

568
00:46:32,509 --> 00:46:36,676
or if he's loyal to the
Third Reich, but we want him.

569
00:46:38,345 --> 00:46:40,619
I don't understand this
sounds like a job for the OSS

570
00:46:40,619 --> 00:46:41,701
where do I come in?

571
00:46:41,701 --> 00:46:45,760
You may have encountered
some of these weapons,

572
00:46:45,760 --> 00:46:49,927
and that contact gives unique
perspective on these matters.

573
00:46:52,351 --> 00:46:54,358
You're being reassigned Schmidt.

574
00:46:54,358 --> 00:46:56,755
You and Sergeant Gary.

575
00:46:56,755 --> 00:46:58,317
Permission to speak freely sir.

576
00:46:58,317 --> 00:46:59,234
Go ahead.

577
00:47:01,419 --> 00:47:03,021
I just don't think I'm
the right man for the job.

578
00:47:03,021 --> 00:47:04,167
I keep losing men and...

579
00:47:04,167 --> 00:47:07,941
Listen son you've encountered
these things up close

580
00:47:07,941 --> 00:47:10,012
and you're still alive,

581
00:47:10,012 --> 00:47:13,062
you know what these things
are capable of first hand.

582
00:47:13,062 --> 00:47:14,564
But sir I just don't think that...

583
00:47:14,564 --> 00:47:18,624
Look, how many more men
do you think we'll lose

584
00:47:18,624 --> 00:47:21,951
if these things aren't stopped?

585
00:47:21,951 --> 00:47:24,187
Remember Bagwell?

586
00:47:24,187 --> 00:47:25,020
Stamper?

587
00:47:27,849 --> 00:47:30,043
This could be the
turning point of the war.

588
00:47:30,043 --> 00:47:32,230
Son we need you on this.

589
00:47:32,230 --> 00:47:34,980
(dramatic music)

590
00:47:39,408 --> 00:47:41,466
What's my objective?

591
00:47:41,466 --> 00:47:43,196
No no you can't stand there and tell me

592
00:47:43,196 --> 00:47:45,627
that the 42 Indians was a good team,

593
00:47:45,627 --> 00:47:46,535
they didn't have nobody.

594
00:47:46,535 --> 00:47:48,329
Nobody? (Laughing)

595
00:47:48,329 --> 00:47:50,778
What you call Jimmy Grant nobody?

596
00:47:50,778 --> 00:47:53,528
Or Buddy Rosar, Mickey Rucko huh?

597
00:47:54,935 --> 00:47:56,827
What Hank Edwards a nobody?

598
00:47:56,827 --> 00:47:59,244
- Never heard of them.
- Yeah.

599
00:48:01,327 --> 00:48:02,197
Sarge why don't you just go ahead

600
00:48:02,197 --> 00:48:04,465
and root for a real team?

601
00:48:04,465 --> 00:48:05,465
Like the Yankees.

602
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:08,136
Babe Ruth number (speaking
in a foreign language)

603
00:48:08,136 --> 00:48:08,969
Shut up.

604
00:48:11,276 --> 00:48:14,199
Even the krauts have heard
of the New York Yankees.

605
00:48:14,199 --> 00:48:16,691
(laughing)

606
00:48:16,691 --> 00:48:19,336
[Man] Excuse me sir we're
looking for Captain Russo.

607
00:48:19,336 --> 00:48:20,351
I'm Captain Russo.

608
00:48:20,351 --> 00:48:22,479
[Man] Sir I'm here to escort
you back to headquarters.

609
00:48:22,479 --> 00:48:23,312
What is it?

610
00:48:23,312 --> 00:48:24,145
[Man] Beats me sir,

611
00:48:24,145 --> 00:48:27,301
all I know is I'm to take
you to Colonel Parks.

612
00:48:27,301 --> 00:48:28,134
Alright.

613
00:48:29,700 --> 00:48:33,212
Think you guys could
meet me there Armstrong?

614
00:48:33,212 --> 00:48:34,879
In the back Private.

615
00:49:05,590 --> 00:49:07,665
Captain Russo to see Colonel Parks.

616
00:49:07,665 --> 00:49:11,332
- He's right inside sir.
- Thank you Private.

617
00:49:13,192 --> 00:49:14,025
Russo good.

618
00:49:14,025 --> 00:49:16,178
You wanted to see me Colonel Parks?

619
00:49:16,178 --> 00:49:20,324
Russo you remember
Lieutenant Schmidt, OSS.

620
00:49:20,324 --> 00:49:21,157
OSS?

621
00:49:22,116 --> 00:49:24,773
Last I heard is that
you were shipped home.

622
00:49:24,773 --> 00:49:28,461
Colonel Parks are you
sure you got the right guy?

623
00:49:28,461 --> 00:49:29,294
Russo.

624
00:49:30,518 --> 00:49:31,351
Yes sir?

625
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:37,349
It seems Lieutenant is
questioning my choice of personnel.

626
00:49:37,349 --> 00:49:38,182
Yes sir.

627
00:49:40,063 --> 00:49:43,146
Is that what's going on Lieutenant?

628
00:49:45,016 --> 00:49:46,349
- No sir.
- Good.

629
00:49:47,667 --> 00:49:49,110
Then let's get down to business.

630
00:49:49,110 --> 00:49:53,027
Russo, you remember
the night of the landing?

631
00:49:55,670 --> 00:49:59,837
(explosions booming)
(guns firing)

632
00:50:08,920 --> 00:50:11,837
(airplane buzzing)

633
00:50:27,236 --> 00:50:28,736
- Thunder.
- Flash.

634
00:50:31,652 --> 00:50:32,485
Schmidt.

635
00:50:36,538 --> 00:50:37,667
[Schmidt] Lieutenant.

636
00:50:37,667 --> 00:50:39,024
Is this all that's left of your squad?

637
00:50:39,024 --> 00:50:41,191
That's all I could find.

638
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:43,598
Where's Captain Davis?

639
00:50:43,598 --> 00:50:45,265
He didn't make it.

640
00:50:46,984 --> 00:50:49,232
So that means you're in charge now?

641
00:50:49,232 --> 00:50:50,315
Yeah, yeah.

642
00:50:54,085 --> 00:50:54,918
(laughing)

643
00:50:54,918 --> 00:50:57,231
Okay, let's move out.

644
00:50:57,231 --> 00:51:00,231
(suspenseful music)

645
00:51:15,859 --> 00:51:17,993
Simpson how about a smoke?

646
00:51:17,993 --> 00:51:20,993
(suspenseful music)

647
00:51:25,448 --> 00:51:29,908
Well Lieutenant don't you
think we should check it out?

648
00:51:29,908 --> 00:51:30,741
Yeah.

649
00:51:33,940 --> 00:51:35,357
Stamper, Bagwell.

650
00:51:38,204 --> 00:51:41,115
Alright you two, go and
check out the situation,

651
00:51:41,115 --> 00:51:42,765
report back to me.

652
00:51:42,765 --> 00:51:43,682
Alright go.

653
00:51:50,594 --> 00:51:52,927
Why's he only sending two?

654
00:51:57,278 --> 00:52:00,111
(unnerving music)

655
00:52:11,269 --> 00:52:13,526
(grunting)

656
00:52:13,526 --> 00:52:16,559
- Get on the ground.
- Stop!

657
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:19,624
(growling)

658
00:52:19,624 --> 00:52:20,541
Help, help!

659
00:52:22,538 --> 00:52:24,788
(grunting)

660
00:52:27,462 --> 00:52:28,879
[Man] What the?

661
00:52:32,810 --> 00:52:33,977
[Man] Open fire!

662
00:52:33,977 --> 00:52:36,394
(gun firing)

663
00:52:37,543 --> 00:52:40,415
(growling)

664
00:52:40,415 --> 00:52:43,044
I'm shooting him, but
he doesn't seem to notice.

665
00:52:43,044 --> 00:52:45,461
(gun firing)

666
00:52:48,342 --> 00:52:49,585
(screaming)
(growling)

667
00:52:49,585 --> 00:52:50,418
(thumping)

668
00:52:50,418 --> 00:52:53,091
Man down!
(growling)

669
00:52:53,091 --> 00:52:54,927
(thumping)

670
00:52:54,927 --> 00:52:57,427
(guns firing)

671
00:53:02,734 --> 00:53:06,734
Simpson, check to see
if anyone's still alive.

672
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:12,950
(groaning)

673
00:53:14,376 --> 00:53:16,245
Schmidt's alive.

674
00:53:16,245 --> 00:53:17,078
Great.

675
00:53:18,461 --> 00:53:22,294
Armstrong help Simpson
get Schmidt back to CP.

676
00:53:23,859 --> 00:53:26,109
(groaning)

677
00:53:38,109 --> 00:53:39,832
(growling)

678
00:53:39,832 --> 00:53:42,249
(gun firing)

679
00:53:55,092 --> 00:53:58,157
Russo, remember the
night of the landing?

680
00:53:58,157 --> 00:53:59,990
Yeah, how's the arm?

681
00:54:01,536 --> 00:54:02,973
That guy that we shot.

682
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:05,116
The guy that I shot?

683
00:54:05,116 --> 00:54:08,273
That thing, was just the beginning.

684
00:54:08,273 --> 00:54:10,474
Now we're on the trail of
a Dr. Heinrich Schaltur.

685
00:54:10,474 --> 00:54:11,307
And he has something to do

686
00:54:11,307 --> 00:54:13,159
with the German we saw that night?

687
00:54:13,159 --> 00:54:15,073
That's what we need to find out.

688
00:54:15,073 --> 00:54:19,756
We believe the doctor's
in an area east of Metz.

689
00:54:19,756 --> 00:54:21,506
Behind enemy lines.

690
00:54:22,798 --> 00:54:23,837
That's where we believe a project

691
00:54:23,837 --> 00:54:26,692
called Osiris is located.

692
00:54:26,692 --> 00:54:29,635
You're to escort Lieutenant
Schmidt to the target,

693
00:54:29,635 --> 00:54:32,451
capture our good doctor.

694
00:54:32,451 --> 00:54:34,223
And Russo...
Yes sir?

695
00:54:34,223 --> 00:54:36,470
You can only take four of your men.

696
00:54:36,470 --> 00:54:38,452
Well sir that's all of my men.

697
00:54:38,452 --> 00:54:40,778
I lost Reese, Jackson and Griff.

698
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:41,920
All good men.

699
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:43,003
Damn right.

700
00:54:47,681 --> 00:54:51,645
So your four men, myself and one more.

701
00:54:51,645 --> 00:54:53,317
You mean three or four more?

702
00:54:53,317 --> 00:54:54,567
No, just one.

703
00:54:57,101 --> 00:55:00,101
(suspenseful music)

704
00:55:09,759 --> 00:55:11,382
You Sergeant Gary?

705
00:55:11,382 --> 00:55:13,557
Depends on who's asking.

706
00:55:13,557 --> 00:55:15,186
Rueber and Underwood.

707
00:55:15,186 --> 00:55:16,186
Underwood.

708
00:55:17,443 --> 00:55:20,819
We're wondering why
we have two NCO's now.

709
00:55:20,819 --> 00:55:21,896
You're Russo's men.

710
00:55:21,896 --> 00:55:23,227
Yeah I was just shipped in last...

711
00:55:23,227 --> 00:55:24,060
What he's trying to say

712
00:55:24,060 --> 00:55:26,968
is we're the last of Captain Russo's men.

713
00:55:26,968 --> 00:55:31,084
We already have a sergeant,
so why do we have you?

714
00:55:31,084 --> 00:55:31,917
I see.

715
00:55:33,310 --> 00:55:38,183
Well fellas this is one of
those need to know missions

716
00:55:38,183 --> 00:55:40,766
and you don't need to know yet.

717
00:55:43,239 --> 00:55:44,748
Is that him?

718
00:55:44,748 --> 00:55:46,248
Yeah that's him.

719
00:55:47,380 --> 00:55:49,504
Special skills huh?

720
00:55:49,504 --> 00:55:52,440
Doesn't look that special to me.

721
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:53,398
Look I know you outrank me

722
00:55:53,398 --> 00:55:55,040
but we need to work together on this.

723
00:55:55,040 --> 00:55:56,759
Don't worry Lieutenant

724
00:55:56,759 --> 00:55:59,271
I know who's in charge of this operation.

725
00:55:59,271 --> 00:56:01,908
Captain what's the story?

726
00:56:01,908 --> 00:56:04,282
Lieutenant Schmidt
we heard you were dead.

727
00:56:04,282 --> 00:56:06,250
And we were all envious.

728
00:56:06,250 --> 00:56:08,000
Simpson, Armstrong.

729
00:56:11,204 --> 00:56:13,960
Lieutenant Schmidt's gonna
be with us for a few days boys.

730
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:15,378
Where are we going sir?

731
00:56:15,378 --> 00:56:18,234
I hear Underwood speaks German.

732
00:56:18,234 --> 00:56:19,732
[Man] That's what he says.

733
00:56:19,732 --> 00:56:22,768
Good we move out in an hour.

734
00:56:22,768 --> 00:56:24,435
Oh son of a bitch.

735
00:56:26,626 --> 00:56:27,459
Yeah.

736
00:56:28,379 --> 00:56:31,129
(dramatic music)

737
00:56:36,413 --> 00:56:39,585
You see people under
estimated Jimmy Grant,

738
00:56:39,585 --> 00:56:43,071
he was a great hitter, always consistent.

739
00:56:43,071 --> 00:56:45,437
He was with the Indians Sarge.

740
00:56:45,437 --> 00:56:47,555
You can't tell me the Cleveland Indians

741
00:56:47,555 --> 00:56:49,528
is a better team than
the New York Yankees.

742
00:56:49,528 --> 00:56:51,111
You know this argument never gets old.

743
00:56:51,111 --> 00:56:52,160
No sir.

744
00:56:52,160 --> 00:56:55,114
Gentlemen let's hold up
here for a few minutes,

745
00:56:55,114 --> 00:56:56,687
take a break.

746
00:56:56,687 --> 00:56:58,937
Smoke them if you got them.

747
00:57:00,300 --> 00:57:02,643
Say Simpson can I have a cigarette?

748
00:57:02,643 --> 00:57:04,893
Sorry sir, it's for show.

749
00:57:06,969 --> 00:57:09,969
(suspenseful music)

750
00:57:11,022 --> 00:57:15,159
So one captain, two sergeants,
this must be important.

751
00:57:15,159 --> 00:57:17,741
Not more important
than any other mission.

752
00:57:17,741 --> 00:57:21,324
Come on Sarge what
are we doing out here?

753
00:57:23,620 --> 00:57:27,356
Well we're following
orders by finding the target,

754
00:57:27,356 --> 00:57:31,180
collecting intel, honor,
glory, same old stuff.

755
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:33,053
What about you Lieutenant Schmidt?

756
00:57:33,053 --> 00:57:35,384
You're with intelligence.

757
00:57:35,384 --> 00:57:38,032
What are we doing out here?

758
00:57:38,032 --> 00:57:41,277
Well Corporal this is
a need to know situation.

759
00:57:41,277 --> 00:57:44,209
And you don't need to know.

760
00:57:44,209 --> 00:57:46,459
See Rueber I told you so.

761
00:57:48,049 --> 00:57:52,227
Well the target should
be just over that ridge.

762
00:57:52,227 --> 00:57:53,448
So what I was thinking...

763
00:57:53,448 --> 00:57:56,800
(shouting in a foreign language)

764
00:57:56,800 --> 00:57:58,008
Underwood what's he saying?

765
00:57:58,008 --> 00:57:59,836
"Help me, monster, monster."

766
00:57:59,836 --> 00:58:00,669
(shouting in a foreign language)

767
00:58:00,669 --> 00:58:03,043
- What did he say?
- "Monster, monster" I think.

768
00:58:03,043 --> 00:58:04,233
He's getting closer.

769
00:58:04,233 --> 00:58:08,316
(shouting in a foreign language)

770
00:58:09,623 --> 00:58:11,239
[Russo] Stay back.

771
00:58:11,239 --> 00:58:12,072
Halt.

772
00:58:12,072 --> 00:58:16,155
(speaking in a foreign language)

773
00:58:19,783 --> 00:58:20,616
He's crazy.

774
00:58:20,616 --> 00:58:21,980
I don't know he keeps
saying some kind of monster.

775
00:58:21,980 --> 00:58:26,063
(speaking in a foreign language)

776
00:58:31,039 --> 00:58:33,289
(growling)

777
00:58:34,154 --> 00:58:36,560
(arm snapping)
(screaming)

778
00:58:36,560 --> 00:58:40,727
(thumping)
(gun firing)

779
00:58:41,787 --> 00:58:44,287
(guns firing)

780
00:58:45,145 --> 00:58:46,458
Aim for the head!

781
00:58:46,458 --> 00:58:48,875
(gun firing)

782
00:58:57,938 --> 00:59:00,787
[Man] That's gotta be the
biggest Nazi I've ever seen.

783
00:59:00,787 --> 00:59:03,119
Look at his eyes.

784
00:59:03,119 --> 00:59:04,452
Look familiar?

785
00:59:11,496 --> 00:59:14,066
There's an old abandoned church nearby.

786
00:59:14,066 --> 00:59:17,875
I think we should up in
there until the morning.

787
00:59:17,875 --> 00:59:19,806
Let's move out gentlemen.

788
00:59:19,806 --> 00:59:22,806
(suspenseful music)

789
00:59:52,653 --> 00:59:54,081
Sir.

790
00:59:54,081 --> 00:59:55,121
Sir we've checked it out,

791
00:59:55,121 --> 00:59:57,058
it's secure enough, we can stay here.

792
00:59:57,058 --> 00:59:58,930
Good, good.

793
00:59:58,930 --> 01:00:00,871
Alright I'm gonna take Underwood with me.

794
01:00:00,871 --> 01:00:03,325
The target is about two miles due east.

795
01:00:03,325 --> 01:00:04,641
Alright stay here and get some rest.

796
01:00:04,641 --> 01:00:08,308
I'd like to go with
you if that's alright?

797
01:00:09,883 --> 01:00:12,381
Alright Lieutenant.

798
01:00:12,381 --> 01:00:14,948
You stay here and get camp
setup, Underwood's off the hook.

799
01:00:14,948 --> 01:00:16,473
- Yes sir.
- Let's go.

800
01:00:16,473 --> 01:00:19,056
(spooky music)

801
01:00:22,882 --> 01:00:25,646
These are the coordinates exactly.

802
01:00:25,646 --> 01:00:27,774
What do you see?

803
01:00:27,774 --> 01:00:29,659
[Russo] I got an old factory.

804
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:32,513
Looks like the bombers
have already hit it.

805
01:00:32,513 --> 01:00:34,263
Let me take a look.

806
01:00:41,628 --> 01:00:42,545
Look again.

807
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:47,037
Building closest to us, northwest corner.

808
01:00:51,700 --> 01:00:53,033
Ah, I see one.

809
01:00:54,757 --> 01:00:56,511
Now two soldiers.

810
01:00:56,511 --> 01:00:59,274
Got two soldiers walking the perimeter.

811
01:00:59,274 --> 01:01:01,050
There's something going on here.

812
01:01:01,050 --> 01:01:03,658
This must be the place.

813
01:01:03,658 --> 01:01:06,741
That is a high probability Captain.

814
01:01:09,331 --> 01:01:10,164
Russo,

815
01:01:11,613 --> 01:01:14,688
something's sticking at me and
I gotta get it off my chest.

816
01:01:14,688 --> 01:01:16,521
Speak up Lieutenant.

817
01:01:18,054 --> 01:01:21,554
That night, the night we saw that thing.

818
01:01:26,092 --> 01:01:27,902
What about it?

819
01:01:27,902 --> 01:01:30,161
Look I read your report.

820
01:01:30,161 --> 01:01:34,249
You made no mention of
that super soldier, why?

821
01:01:34,249 --> 01:01:37,258
Come on Jack, you were there,

822
01:01:37,258 --> 01:01:38,841
you saw what I saw.

823
01:01:40,395 --> 01:01:43,066
I didn't think anyone would believe us

824
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:45,019
and I wasn't about to
get pulled out of combat

825
01:01:45,019 --> 01:01:46,684
to answer a bunch of dumb ass questions

826
01:01:46,684 --> 01:01:48,377
from the company shrink.

827
01:01:48,377 --> 01:01:51,063
Listen I took a lot
of heat for that report.

828
01:01:51,063 --> 01:01:54,582
I can't help feeling like you
left me twisting in the wind.

829
01:01:54,582 --> 01:01:58,749
If you're looking for an
apology you're not gonna get it.

830
01:02:00,801 --> 01:02:03,990
(dramatic music)

831
01:02:03,990 --> 01:02:07,753
Jack I've learned one thing out here.

832
01:02:07,753 --> 01:02:10,538
It's that you make a lot
of unpopular decisions,

833
01:02:10,538 --> 01:02:12,371
it's the first of 500,

834
01:02:13,874 --> 01:02:16,782
at least that one didn't
get anybody killed.

835
01:02:16,782 --> 01:02:19,532
(dramatic music)

836
01:02:23,358 --> 01:02:26,210
I'm gonna complete my mission Joe,

837
01:02:26,210 --> 01:02:28,210
no matter what the cost.

838
01:02:32,228 --> 01:02:35,061
Let's go, we'll come back at dawn.

839
01:02:36,506 --> 01:02:38,126
Yeah.

840
01:02:38,126 --> 01:02:42,209
I'd like to get a good
night's rest before I die.

841
01:02:44,497 --> 01:02:45,580
You got it.

842
01:02:52,483 --> 01:02:55,233
(dramatic music)

843
01:03:02,920 --> 01:03:05,416
What's the situation sir?

844
01:03:05,416 --> 01:03:08,702
The target is sitting in a
group of bombed out buildings.

845
01:03:08,702 --> 01:03:10,689
We saw two krauts walking the perimeter

846
01:03:10,689 --> 01:03:13,177
but I'd venture a guess there's
at least six to 12 Germans

847
01:03:13,177 --> 01:03:15,740
hidden in there somewhere.

848
01:03:15,740 --> 01:03:18,468
Underwood, you get your rest tonight,

849
01:03:18,468 --> 01:03:19,985
we need you sharp tomorrow.

850
01:03:19,985 --> 01:03:20,818
Yes sir.

851
01:03:22,396 --> 01:03:24,919
You too Armstrong, hit it.

852
01:03:24,919 --> 01:03:27,669
(dramatic music)

853
01:03:58,918 --> 01:04:00,585
Is that your girl?

854
01:04:01,537 --> 01:04:02,370
Sophia.

855
01:04:06,509 --> 01:04:07,342
Cute.

856
01:04:08,910 --> 01:04:12,841
What's a good looking girl
doing with a dog face like you?

857
01:04:12,841 --> 01:04:14,174
Lucky I guess.

858
01:04:15,342 --> 01:04:17,172
Every night before I get some shuteye

859
01:04:17,172 --> 01:04:20,498
I like to stare into her eyes.

860
01:04:20,498 --> 01:04:21,998
What do you see?

861
01:04:24,642 --> 01:04:25,475
Hope.

862
01:04:26,546 --> 01:04:29,492
Everybody needs hope underpants.

863
01:04:29,492 --> 01:04:32,711
Captain Russo could use some
help in that department.

864
01:04:32,711 --> 01:04:34,294
What do you mean?

865
01:04:36,790 --> 01:04:37,623
Well,

866
01:04:42,960 --> 01:04:45,213
I've been with the
captain since the landing,

867
01:04:45,213 --> 01:04:49,445
Armstrong too, we're the
two guys left on his squad.

868
01:04:49,445 --> 01:04:52,337
Well besides Lieutenant Schmidt.

869
01:04:52,337 --> 01:04:55,025
The day of the landing the
krauts were laying into us.

870
01:04:55,025 --> 01:04:58,942
When the ramp went down
half the men were just,

871
01:05:01,224 --> 01:05:03,632
well it wasn't pretty.

872
01:05:03,632 --> 01:05:06,792
I made it over the side,
got up to the shore somehow.

873
01:05:06,792 --> 01:05:08,338
I don't even remember.

874
01:05:08,338 --> 01:05:12,146
I look over and all the
men are just dropping,

875
01:05:12,146 --> 01:05:16,146
and I see the captain,
he was a lieutenant then.

876
01:05:22,282 --> 01:05:25,052
He was standing there holding a picture

877
01:05:25,052 --> 01:05:26,802
of his wife and kids.

878
01:05:28,244 --> 01:05:31,763
I must have seen that
picture a thousand times,

879
01:05:31,763 --> 01:05:33,808
buried it right there in the sand.

880
01:05:33,808 --> 01:05:36,163
I mean bullets are
flying all over the place

881
01:05:36,163 --> 01:05:40,246
and the captain's acting
like nothing's going on.

882
01:05:42,059 --> 01:05:44,892
We all changed that day Underwood,

883
01:05:45,845 --> 01:05:48,262
but the captain he lost hope.

884
01:05:49,833 --> 01:05:52,416
Does he think he's gonna die?

885
01:05:53,783 --> 01:05:57,558
Yeah well we're all gonna die kid.

886
01:05:57,558 --> 01:06:00,252
Trick is not to lose hope before you do.

887
01:06:00,252 --> 01:06:03,002
(dramatic music)

888
01:06:20,219 --> 01:06:24,637
So this kid you brought
to the party, Gary,

889
01:06:24,637 --> 01:06:26,970
seems pretty ordinary to me.

890
01:06:27,924 --> 01:06:29,341
What's his story?

891
01:06:30,932 --> 01:06:31,820
Listen,

892
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:34,611
if I told you you wouldn't believe me.

893
01:06:34,611 --> 01:06:35,528
Tell him.

894
01:06:37,971 --> 01:06:39,721
Excuse me Sergeant?

895
01:06:43,558 --> 01:06:46,641
Go ahead, tell him, tell everybody.

896
01:06:51,092 --> 01:06:54,425
Sergeant Gary here is what you call a,

897
01:06:55,750 --> 01:06:57,223
a lycanthrope.

898
01:06:57,223 --> 01:07:00,556
What most people refer to as a werewolf.

899
01:07:02,423 --> 01:07:04,256
What a load of crap.

900
01:07:06,628 --> 01:07:08,128
Come on Schmidt.

901
01:07:10,469 --> 01:07:13,386
Look, I didn't ask to be this way

902
01:07:15,401 --> 01:07:18,068
and I don't like being this way,

903
01:07:20,161 --> 01:07:23,494
but when things go down, when I change...

904
01:07:25,218 --> 01:07:26,166
What?

905
01:07:26,166 --> 01:07:28,916
(dramatic music)

906
01:07:32,999 --> 01:07:37,166
I don't expect you to
believe me now, sounds crazy.

907
01:07:42,484 --> 01:07:44,484
But seeing is believing,

908
01:07:46,168 --> 01:07:47,418
and you'll see.

909
01:07:51,002 --> 01:07:54,735
When you do just be
glad you're not a kraut.

910
01:07:54,735 --> 01:07:57,485
(dramatic music)

911
01:08:02,662 --> 01:08:05,829
Good thing I brought an extra razor.

912
01:08:10,261 --> 01:08:13,094
(unnerving music)

913
01:08:50,367 --> 01:08:52,773
Little early for the sauce isn't it?

914
01:08:52,773 --> 01:08:55,440
Yeah well, trying to cut down.

915
01:08:56,919 --> 01:08:58,138
Liquid courage right?

916
01:08:58,138 --> 01:08:59,888
You got that right.

917
01:09:05,496 --> 01:09:06,329
Simpson!

918
01:09:09,526 --> 01:09:13,689
Nothing, he ain't here
but I did find his uniform.

919
01:09:13,689 --> 01:09:15,800
Where the hell is Gary?

920
01:09:15,800 --> 01:09:18,300
(goofy music)

921
01:09:19,584 --> 01:09:22,069
[Gary] What the hell are you looking at?

922
01:09:22,069 --> 01:09:23,819
Apparently nothing.

923
01:09:32,297 --> 01:09:35,943
Alright gentlemen as
soon as Gary is ready

924
01:09:35,943 --> 01:09:38,510
we can get out of here.

925
01:09:38,510 --> 01:09:40,586
(imitating howling)

926
01:09:40,586 --> 01:09:41,923
Got a light Schmidt?

927
01:09:41,923 --> 01:09:44,923
(suspenseful music)

928
01:10:09,770 --> 01:10:10,603
Underwood.

929
01:10:14,326 --> 01:10:15,722
I need you to take a position

930
01:10:15,722 --> 01:10:17,088
where you can take those two Germans out

931
01:10:17,088 --> 01:10:19,066
with the machine gun.
Yes sir.

932
01:10:19,066 --> 01:10:22,935
Underwood, see clear and shoot straight.

933
01:10:22,935 --> 01:10:24,124
Yes sir.

934
01:10:24,124 --> 01:10:27,124
(suspenseful music)

935
01:10:41,898 --> 01:10:43,390
Doesn't look good,

936
01:10:43,390 --> 01:10:45,309
there's gotta be krauts everywhere.

937
01:10:45,309 --> 01:10:47,191
There's at least two
walking the perimeter.

938
01:10:47,191 --> 01:10:48,375
There's gotta be more around the back.

939
01:10:48,375 --> 01:10:50,033
I know, I know, listen,

940
01:10:50,033 --> 01:10:51,458
when Underwood takes out those two Germans

941
01:10:51,458 --> 01:10:53,841
we're gonna move in fast alright?

942
01:10:53,841 --> 01:10:55,674
Gentlemen, stay sharp.

943
01:10:56,943 --> 01:10:59,943
(suspenseful music)

944
01:11:04,724 --> 01:11:06,838
Come on show me something.

945
01:11:06,838 --> 01:11:10,318
(suspenseful music)

946
01:11:10,318 --> 01:11:11,735
Come on, come on.

947
01:11:14,302 --> 01:11:15,450
Thank you.

948
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:17,325
(gun firing)

949
01:11:17,325 --> 01:11:18,242
Move out.

950
01:11:20,740 --> 01:11:23,805
(gun firing)
(suspenseful music)

951
01:11:23,805 --> 01:11:24,757
(gun firing)

952
01:11:24,757 --> 01:11:26,490
- Take cover!
- Cover!

953
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:28,990
(guns firing)

954
01:11:34,858 --> 01:11:37,273
Rueber grenade that window.

955
01:11:37,273 --> 01:11:38,359
You got it.

956
01:11:38,359 --> 01:11:40,922
Covering fire, now, cover.

957
01:11:40,922 --> 01:11:45,089
(guns firing)
(suspenseful music)

958
01:11:57,404 --> 01:11:58,904
[Rueber] Eat it.

959
01:12:00,092 --> 01:12:02,477
(explosion booming)

960
01:12:02,477 --> 01:12:05,477
(suspenseful music)

961
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:19,140
(guns firing)

962
01:12:22,361 --> 01:12:24,857
Armstrong, Armstrong!

963
01:12:24,857 --> 01:12:26,444
(guns firing)

964
01:12:26,444 --> 01:12:28,746
I don't know where Armstrong is.

965
01:12:28,746 --> 01:12:31,896
(guns firing)

966
01:12:31,896 --> 01:12:33,363
Where the hell is Armstrong?

967
01:12:33,363 --> 01:12:34,334
(guns firing)

968
01:12:34,334 --> 01:12:36,219
I don't see him.

969
01:12:36,219 --> 01:12:40,386
(guns firing)
(suspenseful music)

970
01:12:47,247 --> 01:12:48,247
Armstrong.

971
01:12:51,050 --> 01:12:53,746
[Armstrong] I think I got them.

972
01:12:53,746 --> 01:12:55,039
You got some good men Russo.

973
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:56,607
Damn right.

974
01:12:56,607 --> 01:12:58,857
(growling)

975
01:13:01,426 --> 01:13:04,024
Damn I think there's one more left.

976
01:13:04,024 --> 01:13:04,895
Your observational skills

977
01:13:04,895 --> 01:13:06,810
never cease to amaze me Sergeant.

978
01:13:06,810 --> 01:13:09,643
(unnerving music)

979
01:13:10,907 --> 01:13:13,157
(growling)

980
01:13:15,154 --> 01:13:17,654
(guns firing)

981
01:13:23,652 --> 01:13:25,043
Not another one.

982
01:13:25,043 --> 01:13:29,210
(guns firing)
(suspenseful music)

983
01:13:45,627 --> 01:13:48,193
Sure does stink doesn't he?

984
01:13:48,193 --> 01:13:51,057
One things for sure they're
making them a lot uglier.

985
01:13:51,057 --> 01:13:54,062
Jesus he's still twitching.

986
01:13:54,062 --> 01:13:56,229
Take a good look fellas.

987
01:13:57,267 --> 01:13:59,833
We're about to go find daddy.

988
01:13:59,833 --> 01:14:02,833
(suspenseful music)

989
01:14:43,344 --> 01:14:45,963
Care to lead the way Lieutenant?

990
01:14:45,963 --> 01:14:47,351
Of course.

991
01:14:47,351 --> 01:14:50,101
(dramatic music)

992
01:14:53,347 --> 01:14:56,014
So, if it gets harry in there,

993
01:14:56,930 --> 01:14:58,930
you're gonna get, hairy?

994
01:15:01,942 --> 01:15:03,749
You better hope so.

995
01:15:03,749 --> 01:15:06,499
(dramatic music)

996
01:15:10,262 --> 01:15:13,047
[Simpson] Do not like the look of this.

997
01:15:13,047 --> 01:15:14,929
Ah shut it Simpson.

998
01:15:14,929 --> 01:15:18,005
(dramatic music)

999
01:15:18,005 --> 01:15:20,302
- Alright let's split up.
- Yeah.

1000
01:15:20,302 --> 01:15:21,337
Simpson, Armstrong.

1001
01:15:21,337 --> 01:15:23,968
Gary you're with me.

1002
01:15:23,968 --> 01:15:27,487
Schmidt, if you find
anything you can't explain

1003
01:15:27,487 --> 01:15:29,067
don't touch it.

1004
01:15:29,067 --> 01:15:31,817
(dramatic music)

1005
01:15:51,130 --> 01:15:53,713
(spooky music)

1006
01:16:04,127 --> 01:16:05,736
Yeah I see it.

1007
01:16:05,736 --> 01:16:08,903
There's a light coming from that room.

1008
01:16:10,720 --> 01:16:13,161
Do you think we ought to go in?

1009
01:16:13,161 --> 01:16:15,744
(spooky music)

1010
01:16:33,124 --> 01:16:34,559
Clear up.

1011
01:16:34,559 --> 01:16:36,906
- Clear down.
- Clear to the left.

1012
01:16:36,906 --> 01:16:37,739
Clear.

1013
01:16:39,414 --> 01:16:41,609
Alright check the rest of the room.

1014
01:16:41,609 --> 01:16:44,192
(spooky music)

1015
01:16:45,074 --> 01:16:46,896
(flies buzzing)

1016
01:16:46,896 --> 01:16:49,479
(spooky music)

1017
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:11,023
Jackpot.

1018
01:17:14,982 --> 01:17:19,149
(sniffing)
(groaning)

1019
01:17:21,150 --> 01:17:23,156
I think I see something.

1020
01:17:23,156 --> 01:17:26,156
(suspenseful music)

1021
01:17:27,868 --> 01:17:28,701
Hey.

1022
01:17:29,745 --> 01:17:31,371
(coughing)
Are you alright?

1023
01:17:31,371 --> 01:17:33,288
I said are you alright?

1024
01:17:35,287 --> 01:17:36,939
You alright Underwood?

1025
01:17:36,939 --> 01:17:38,400
He's alright.

1026
01:17:38,400 --> 01:17:39,983
Just a dead body.

1027
01:17:41,908 --> 01:17:45,258
Well whatever these things
are they don't discriminate.

1028
01:17:45,258 --> 01:17:46,632
Lucky us.

1029
01:17:46,632 --> 01:17:49,215
(spooky music)

1030
01:18:03,219 --> 01:18:05,308
Over there guys.

1031
01:18:05,308 --> 01:18:08,188
Are you Dr. Heinrich Schaltur?

1032
01:18:08,188 --> 01:18:09,495
Speak English?

1033
01:18:09,495 --> 01:18:10,578
Yeah, yeah.

1034
01:18:14,293 --> 01:18:15,126
My family.

1035
01:18:18,064 --> 01:18:19,981
My wife, my little boy.

1036
01:18:22,980 --> 01:18:26,897
They said if I did not
make the formula in time

1037
01:18:27,920 --> 01:18:30,670
they would kill them, one by one.

1038
01:18:35,464 --> 01:18:36,756
Formula?

1039
01:18:36,756 --> 01:18:39,006
(coughing)

1040
01:18:39,873 --> 01:18:44,040
I gave them soldiers, that
were impervious to bullets,

1041
01:18:46,430 --> 01:18:48,097
no pain, ubersoldat.

1042
01:18:51,271 --> 01:18:53,938
That explains Fritz and Frack.

1043
01:18:56,094 --> 01:18:58,344
There are two prototypes,

1044
01:18:59,238 --> 01:19:02,488
they had abnormal strength and stamina.

1045
01:19:04,657 --> 01:19:06,657
Is that what did this?

1046
01:19:11,001 --> 01:19:12,834
Is that what did this?

1047
01:19:14,849 --> 01:19:17,849
(suspenseful music)

1048
01:19:29,794 --> 01:19:32,461
They wanted stronger soldiers.

1049
01:19:36,445 --> 01:19:39,612
So I made another test on the formula.

1050
01:19:44,903 --> 01:19:47,153
It must've been too strong.

1051
01:19:52,029 --> 01:19:53,196
Where is it?

1052
01:19:55,131 --> 01:19:59,298
(gun cocking)
(suspenseful music)

1053
01:20:08,072 --> 01:20:09,322
Jesus Christ.

1054
01:20:11,842 --> 01:20:15,483
Anybody got any clean underwear?

1055
01:20:15,483 --> 01:20:17,733
(coughing)

1056
01:20:21,498 --> 01:20:23,395
Go get Russo and his men over here now.

1057
01:20:23,395 --> 01:20:24,518
We'll set the explosives on a timer

1058
01:20:24,518 --> 01:20:27,470
and get the doc out of here.

1059
01:20:27,470 --> 01:20:29,099
Doctor?

1060
01:20:29,099 --> 01:20:31,349
(coughing)

1061
01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:35,861
(suspenseful music)

1062
01:20:38,068 --> 01:20:39,548
Doctor are you alright?

1063
01:20:39,548 --> 01:20:41,491
(growling)

1064
01:20:41,491 --> 01:20:44,337
(banging)
(groaning)

1065
01:20:44,337 --> 01:20:45,920
Captain, Captain.

1066
01:20:47,568 --> 01:20:49,030
We found the doctor.

1067
01:20:49,030 --> 01:20:50,671
Good, good.

1068
01:20:50,671 --> 01:20:53,671
(suspenseful music)

1069
01:20:57,880 --> 01:20:59,611
Do I smell that?

1070
01:20:59,611 --> 01:21:03,249
(suspenseful music)

1071
01:21:03,249 --> 01:21:04,082
Yeah.

1072
01:21:05,005 --> 01:21:06,989
(growling)

1073
01:21:06,989 --> 01:21:09,581
(thumping)

1074
01:21:09,581 --> 01:21:12,664
Fire!
(guns firing)

1075
01:21:15,846 --> 01:21:17,318
(shouting)

1076
01:21:17,318 --> 01:21:19,421
(thumping)

1077
01:21:19,421 --> 01:21:20,861
(groaning)

1078
01:21:20,861 --> 01:21:23,239
(suspenseful music)

1079
01:21:23,239 --> 01:21:27,406
(guns firing)
(suspenseful music)

1080
01:21:31,749 --> 01:21:34,155
Get him, get him now!

1081
01:21:34,155 --> 01:21:37,155
(suspenseful music)

1082
01:21:46,863 --> 01:21:48,144
Schmidt what the hell are you doing?

1083
01:21:48,144 --> 01:21:49,210
We have men in there.

1084
01:21:49,210 --> 01:21:52,354
The formula, the doctor said
that this was the formula.

1085
01:21:52,354 --> 01:21:53,721
What formula?

1086
01:21:53,721 --> 01:21:55,614
You've seen what that thing can do.

1087
01:21:55,614 --> 01:21:57,332
There's no way a human can beat that.

1088
01:21:57,332 --> 01:22:00,332
(suspenseful music)

1089
01:22:08,145 --> 01:22:10,275
This is my job Schmidt.

1090
01:22:10,275 --> 01:22:13,873
(suspenseful music)

1091
01:22:13,873 --> 01:22:16,040
(howling)

1092
01:22:17,869 --> 01:22:22,036
(thumping)
(suspenseful music)

1093
01:22:42,065 --> 01:22:46,232
(coughing)
(suspenseful music)

1094
01:22:51,817 --> 01:22:55,984
(thumping)
(suspenseful music)

1095
01:23:09,070 --> 01:23:11,056
(slicing whooshing)

1096
01:23:11,056 --> 01:23:14,056
(suspenseful music)

1097
01:23:18,118 --> 01:23:20,368
(growling)

1098

01:25:44,170 --> 01:25:46,920
(dramatic music)

1137
01:26:09,246 --> 01:26:12,407

I know sir.

1146
01:26:50,043 --> 01:26:52,025

1149
01:26:57,243 --> 01:26:59,765

1150
01:26:59,765 --> 01:27:01,699
