1
00:00:08,696 --> 00:00:13,599
<i>In the beginning, God created the universe...</i>

2
00:00:16,771 --> 00:00:18,705
<i>the heavens...</i>

3
00:00:20,541 --> 00:00:22,702
<i>and the earth.</i>

4
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:34,181
<i>Then God created the first nerd.</i>

5
00:01:04,151 --> 00:01:07,018
I'm going to take note
on your champagne glasses.

6
00:01:07,088 --> 00:01:11,388
Check the silver service
and make sure it's properly polished.

7
00:01:11,459 --> 00:01:14,553
Eugene, take this to the kitchen.
Make sure the steam tables have arrived.

8
00:01:14,629 --> 00:01:17,530
Check on the tablecloths
and make sure they're the right color.

9
00:01:23,137 --> 00:01:25,332
Oh, boy.
Oh, boy, I don't know.

10
00:01:25,406 --> 00:01:27,874
Aaron, relax.
You're driving us all crazy.

11
00:01:27,942 --> 00:01:29,876
This better be a great wedding.

12
00:01:29,944 --> 00:01:33,141
Every political heavyweight from the party
is gonna be there checking me out.

13
00:01:33,214 --> 00:01:36,843
Jeanie's wedding is going to be wonderful.
Fix your ascot.

14
00:01:36,917 --> 00:01:40,978
<i>How come we never met this guy</i>
<i>that Jeanie's marrying?</i>

15
00:01:41,055 --> 00:01:43,649
- <i>What's his name again?</i>
- Dudley Dawson.

16
00:01:43,724 --> 00:01:47,922
- Yeah.
- Hey, I wonder if he's from
the Schenectady Dawsons?

17
00:01:47,995 --> 00:01:50,361
They're a very powerful
family back east.

18
00:01:50,431 --> 00:01:52,456
I went to school with Cap Dawson.

19
00:01:52,533 --> 00:01:56,299
- Talk about your blue bloods.
- Isn't it just a little bit strange...

20
00:01:56,370 --> 00:02:00,033
that Jeanie never brought,
uh, what's-his-butt over here before?

21
00:02:00,107 --> 00:02:04,373
His name is Dudley.
They only met three months ago.

22
00:02:04,445 --> 00:02:06,504
I knew I'd be a shoo-in
with the people...

23
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:09,515
if I could just get those old-money
blue bloods to endorse my candidacy.

24
00:02:09,583 --> 00:02:12,017
And they'd be damn fools
not to, Dad...

25
00:02:12,086 --> 00:02:15,021
irregardless of the fact
that you are nouveau riche.

26
00:02:19,326 --> 00:02:22,989
Don't you ever use that phrase
in this house!

27
00:02:23,064 --> 00:02:28,502
I am not nouveau riche.
I am a self-made businessman.

28
00:02:28,569 --> 00:02:31,367
And I'm not your dad.
I'm your father-in-law. Get it?

29
00:02:31,439 --> 00:02:35,899
Right. Self-made businessman.
Father-in law. I got it.

30
00:02:35,976 --> 00:02:38,570
Can we please stop talking
about the campaign for a minute?

31
00:02:38,646 --> 00:02:41,843
Focus on Jeanie's wedding.
That's what's important here.

32
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:44,384
<i>Gaylord's right, as usual.</i>

33
00:02:45,653 --> 00:02:49,384
- <i>Hi, everybody.</i>
- Jeanie!

34
00:02:51,325 --> 00:02:54,817
- You look wonderful.
- Thank you.

35
00:02:54,895 --> 00:02:56,886
I love that outfit.

36
00:02:56,964 --> 00:02:59,057
You do?

37
00:02:59,133 --> 00:03:02,591
- So, you excited?
- Oh, yeah.

38
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:05,571
Where'd you meet... Dudley?

39
00:03:05,639 --> 00:03:09,097
Well, at a ham
and lima bean cookout.

40
00:03:15,149 --> 00:03:17,447
It was an Omega Mu sorority fund-raiser.

41
00:03:17,518 --> 00:03:19,816
Oh, sure, sure.

42
00:03:19,887 --> 00:03:25,120
The Schenectady Dawsons are very big
with sororities and fund-raisers and cookouts.

43
00:03:25,192 --> 00:03:29,891
All your questions will be answered in a moment.

44
00:03:29,964 --> 00:03:31,955
Oh!

45
00:03:32,032 --> 00:03:34,193
- <i>Booger?</i>
- Why'd she call him Booger?

46
00:03:36,370 --> 00:03:38,304
- Baby!
- Oh!

47
00:03:38,372 --> 00:03:40,306
Oh, honey.

48
00:03:40,374 --> 00:03:43,639
Oh... buns.

49
00:03:43,711 --> 00:03:46,111
Give me buns!

50
00:03:46,180 --> 00:03:48,876
- <i>May I have them, please?</i>
- <i>Stop it!</i>

51
00:03:48,949 --> 00:03:51,110
- <i>Give me buns!</i>
- <i>Shh! No! Shh!</i>

52
00:03:51,185 --> 00:03:53,779
Moo! Moo!

53
00:03:53,854 --> 00:03:55,947
My family is waiting to meet you.

54
00:03:57,625 --> 00:04:01,561
- Mommy!
- Tippy! Tippy!

55
00:04:01,629 --> 00:04:05,463
- What happened?
- Mommy fainted.

56
00:04:05,533 --> 00:04:07,626
Gosh, are you all right,
Mrs. Humphrey?

57
00:04:07,701 --> 00:04:10,966
- Yeah, I-
- She'll be fine. Can I ask you a question?

58
00:04:11,038 --> 00:04:13,973
<i>Are you from the Schenectady Dawsons,</i>
<i>railroad money?</i>

59
00:04:14,041 --> 00:04:15,975
- Hmm?
- Uh, no.

60
00:04:16,043 --> 00:04:18,773
The Detroit Dawsons.
Sewing machine rental money.

61
00:04:18,846 --> 00:04:24,478
- There's gonna be an egg. Where's the kitchen?
- Oh, to the left!

62
00:04:24,552 --> 00:04:27,419
- Are you all right, Mommy?
- Yes, yes, I'm fine.

63
00:04:27,488 --> 00:04:29,922
I don't know what came over me. Oh!

64
00:04:29,990 --> 00:04:31,924
Sewing machine rental money?

65
00:04:31,992 --> 00:04:34,825
My God, he's a nerd!

66
00:04:36,897 --> 00:04:39,263
A nerd?
How can you tell?

67
00:04:39,333 --> 00:04:41,927
There were a lot of nerds at USC.

68
00:04:42,002 --> 00:04:45,028
I can smell a nerd a mile away.

69
00:04:45,105 --> 00:04:48,541
Well, I've heard nerds
make wonderful husbands.

70
00:04:48,609 --> 00:04:51,908
And they're smart too.

71
00:04:51,979 --> 00:04:55,176
She's obviously getting even
with us for something.

72
00:04:57,618 --> 00:05:00,178
- Beef! We need beef!
- In there!

73
00:05:03,090 --> 00:05:05,490
That was kind of a rocky start
with your family.

74
00:05:05,559 --> 00:05:07,550
Oh, everything's fine.
My mom's great.

75
00:05:07,628 --> 00:05:09,562
I'm sure she's just overwhelmed
from all the excitement.

76
00:05:09,630 --> 00:05:12,997
- You don't think it's because they don't like me?
- Booger, I love you.

77
00:05:13,067 --> 00:05:17,128
Well, yeah, I know you-
I got it! I know you do.

78
00:05:17,204 --> 00:05:20,571
But I was just afraid maybe your "mishpukin"'
was thinking you were "mistookin'."

79
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:23,337
They're gonna love you too, Booger.
I know they will.

80
00:05:23,410 --> 00:05:25,537
Oh!

81
00:05:25,613 --> 00:05:28,639
Here you go, Mrs. Humphrey.
Put this on the- Hey!

82
00:05:28,716 --> 00:05:31,207
Oh!

83
00:05:31,285 --> 00:05:35,085
<i>Don't move. Don't move.</i>
<i>Excuse me. That was clumsy.</i>

84
00:05:35,155 --> 00:05:37,988
<i>There we go.</i>
<i>I've got it.</i>

85
00:05:38,058 --> 00:05:40,583
Can I speak to you a second, Jeanie?

86
00:05:40,661 --> 00:05:42,322
Sure.

87
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,064
Thank you, dear.

88
00:05:49,136 --> 00:05:51,331
It stops the swelling.

89
00:05:56,477 --> 00:05:58,411
Are you pregnant?

90
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:01,414
Pregnant? No!

91
00:06:01,482 --> 00:06:04,007
You mean, you don't
have to marry him?

92
00:06:04,084 --> 00:06:08,919
- Daddy!
- I would like you to come with me
to a cult deprogramming.

93
00:06:08,989 --> 00:06:12,425
J-Just show up there and be open.
That's all I ask.

94
00:06:13,794 --> 00:06:16,854
I just can't believe you're saying this.

95
00:06:16,931 --> 00:06:21,766
Wh-Where are you going?
This is good stuff I'm telling you.

96
00:06:21,835 --> 00:06:24,531
I love Booger!

97
00:06:24,605 --> 00:06:29,133
And I'm gonna marry him no matter
what you think!

98
00:06:29,209 --> 00:06:31,609
Jeanie?

99
00:06:31,679 --> 00:06:33,476
Sweetheart, you're overreacting.

100
00:06:33,547 --> 00:06:36,607
- What did you say to her?
- <i>Nothing.</i>

101
00:06:36,684 --> 00:06:40,211
Nothing. We just had
a little conversation, that's all.

102
00:06:40,287 --> 00:06:42,778
Can't we all just get along?

103
00:06:42,856 --> 00:06:46,485
<i>She comes home with a guy who looks like</i>
<i>he came out of a vending machine...</i>

104
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:49,825
- and I'm the one who's wrong.
- <i>Jeanie. Jeanie.</i>

105
00:06:53,200 --> 00:06:55,395
What a world.

106
00:06:56,370 --> 00:06:58,964
Hey!

107
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,337
Hi, I'm Jeanie's sister, Gaylord.

108
00:07:01,408 --> 00:07:04,468
And this is my husband, Chip.
Chip Medford.

109
00:07:04,545 --> 00:07:07,480
Great idea. Having the wedding
on Valentine's Day.

110
00:07:15,889 --> 00:07:19,017
<i>Are you sure your best man knows</i>
<i>where we are located?</i>

111
00:07:19,093 --> 00:07:21,857
Oh, he'll find it all right.

112
00:07:23,130 --> 00:07:26,190
As a matter of fact,
he will be here in exactly...

113
00:07:26,266 --> 00:07:28,200
seven seconds.

114
00:07:28,268 --> 00:07:31,260
<i>Five, four...</i>

115
00:07:31,338 --> 00:07:34,671
three, two, one.

116
00:07:37,311 --> 00:07:41,179
<i>Right on the button.</i>
<i>Lewis!</i>

117
00:07:41,248 --> 00:07:44,012
Booger!

118
00:07:44,084 --> 00:07:46,177
Pull in here!

119
00:08:03,937 --> 00:08:07,270
- Oh, Booger's wedding.
- Yeah!

120
00:08:07,341 --> 00:08:10,469
- Booger's gettin' married.
- Oh, come on. Stop it!

121
00:08:10,544 --> 00:08:12,478
Hey, what do you think of the truck?

122
00:08:12,546 --> 00:08:15,014
I would expect nothing else
from the king of the nerds.

123
00:08:15,082 --> 00:08:16,982
- It's got everything.
- Where's Betty?

124
00:08:17,051 --> 00:08:19,451
Oh, follow me.

125
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:22,387
- Would you like to see my unborn fetal son?
- Yeah.

126
00:08:22,456 --> 00:08:24,754
This is a state-of-the-art,
remote-activated...

127
00:08:24,825 --> 00:08:28,261
microwave-transmitted,
bilingual, five DB-gain...

128
00:08:28,328 --> 00:08:31,161
semi-duplex fetal monitor.

129
00:08:31,231 --> 00:08:35,668
I can check on the development
the vital signs of my unborn fetal son...

130
00:08:35,736 --> 00:08:39,069
- from anywhere in the universe.
- Look.

131
00:08:39,139 --> 00:08:41,004
There's his tinkler.

132
00:08:41,075 --> 00:08:43,737
Just like the old man, huh?

133
00:08:54,521 --> 00:08:57,752
- Booger!
- Betty!

134
00:08:57,825 --> 00:09:02,194
- What is this?
- An Airbus A300 Whisper Jet...

135
00:09:02,262 --> 00:09:07,222
could land right on our truck, and Betty and
our unborn fetal son wouldn't be hurt.

136
00:09:07,301 --> 00:09:09,462
- Lewis?
- Hmm?

137
00:09:09,536 --> 00:09:11,697
Could you let me out of here?

138
00:09:11,772 --> 00:09:14,605
- Oh, sure, Betty.
- Here. Let me give you a hand.

139
00:09:14,675 --> 00:09:16,609
Thank you.

140
00:09:18,679 --> 00:09:21,375
So, Booger, how are things going
with the in-laws?

141
00:09:21,448 --> 00:09:23,780
Well, things were going okay...

142
00:09:23,851 --> 00:09:26,877
until my mother-in-law passed out
and cracked her head on the coffee table.

143
00:09:26,954 --> 00:09:31,288
- Oh.
- I don't think my father-in-law likes me at all.

144
00:09:31,358 --> 00:09:34,486
- Oh.
- He's one of those pretentious...

145
00:09:34,561 --> 00:09:38,429
hoity-toity, nouveau riche types.

146
00:09:38,499 --> 00:09:40,865
He may be anti-nerd.

147
00:09:40,934 --> 00:09:43,402
Oh, no.

148
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:45,904
Why does this always
have to poke its ugly head out?

149
00:09:45,973 --> 00:09:49,306
<i>Indeed. We need to nip</i>
<i>this in the bud.</i>

150
00:09:49,376 --> 00:09:54,006
Booger, I want you to know
I take my job as best man very seriously.

151
00:09:54,081 --> 00:09:57,642
And I will take care of everything,
including Jeanie's old man.

152
00:09:57,718 --> 00:10:00,551
Never fear, Skolnick's here.

153
00:10:00,621 --> 00:10:03,181
I love you, you big galoot.

154
00:10:03,257 --> 00:10:05,748
I feel better already.

155
00:10:05,893 --> 00:10:08,828
Hey, here comes the gang.

156
00:10:08,896 --> 00:10:12,457
Hey, guys!

157
00:10:23,744 --> 00:10:26,713
- Lamar!
- Party, party, party!

158
00:10:26,780 --> 00:10:30,375
<i>Booger!</i>

159
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:33,613
Nerds are here!

160
00:10:33,687 --> 00:10:36,019
- Takashi!
- Booger!

161
00:10:37,958 --> 00:10:40,927
- Lewis! Hi, Lewis.
- Takash, how are you? Good to see you.

162
00:10:40,994 --> 00:10:44,225
Oh, Betty! Betty so big.

163
00:10:44,298 --> 00:10:47,358
Oh, look at you!

164
00:10:47,434 --> 00:10:50,562
- Oh, Judy!
- Uncle Lewis!

165
00:10:50,637 --> 00:10:53,401
- Harold! Good trip?
- It was great.

166
00:10:53,473 --> 00:10:56,408
The bus driver said
we were the first group ever...

167
00:10:56,476 --> 00:10:59,912
to make it all the way through
"A Hundred Bottles of Beer on the Wall."

168
00:10:59,980 --> 00:11:02,073
Yes! Hey!

169
00:11:02,149 --> 00:11:05,414
It's been delightful
motoring with you.

170
00:11:05,485 --> 00:11:08,249
<i>Trevor, how was the trip?</i>

171
00:11:08,322 --> 00:11:10,347
I only got carsick twice.

172
00:11:10,424 --> 00:11:12,984
Oh! I'm proud of you, laddie.

173
00:11:18,065 --> 00:11:20,499
I am just so thrilled
you all showed up.

174
00:11:22,302 --> 00:11:25,271
- Stan!
- Hi, guys.

175
00:11:25,339 --> 00:11:28,206
- Stan!
- Booger!

176
00:11:28,275 --> 00:11:30,743
- Great to see you.
- You too.

177
00:11:30,811 --> 00:11:32,904
Oh, Betty, you're gonna make
such a pretty mom.

178
00:11:34,848 --> 00:11:36,782
Stan, you are such a nerd.

179
00:11:36,850 --> 00:11:40,047
Yeah, I sure am.
I'm selling software up in Silicon Valley.

180
00:11:40,120 --> 00:11:42,418
- That's fantastic.
- I've never been happier in my whole life.

181
00:11:45,926 --> 00:11:48,793
Nerds! Nerds! Nerds!

182
00:11:48,862 --> 00:11:52,025
Nerds! Nerds! Nerds!
Nerds! Nerds!

183
00:11:52,099 --> 00:11:54,090
<i>Nerds! Nerds! Nerds!</i>

184
00:11:54,167 --> 00:11:58,001
Nerds! Nerds! Nerds!
Nerds! Nerds! Nerds!

185
00:12:00,941 --> 00:12:04,570
Hey, it looks like
you're breaking out.

186
00:12:04,645 --> 00:12:07,773
What are you talking about?
I've always had a perfect complexion.

187
00:12:08,849 --> 00:12:10,783
I think you've got the chicken pox.

188
00:12:19,226 --> 00:12:23,322
- Easy on the sauce, Aaron.
- You don't think I'm gonna go through this sober?

189
00:12:23,397 --> 00:12:25,888
Come on, relax.
It's not as bad as all that.

190
00:12:25,966 --> 00:12:28,958
What is this dog hair doing here?
We don't have a dog.

191
00:12:29,036 --> 00:12:32,164
<i>Excuse me. Do you prefer</i>
<i>the salad forks to be chilled...</i>

192
00:12:32,239 --> 00:12:34,332
or the salad plates or both?

193
00:12:34,408 --> 00:12:37,002
- Well-
- Figure it out.

194
00:12:37,077 --> 00:12:39,272
- Aaron!
- Oh, I never.

195
00:12:39,346 --> 00:12:43,749
I cannot work in a vacuum.
I need input. I need feedback.

196
00:12:43,817 --> 00:12:46,251
Romeo! Romeo!

197
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:48,880
This is so unfair.

198
00:12:48,955 --> 00:12:52,482
No one told me I would be catering
a wedding for a bunch of nerds.

199
00:12:52,559 --> 00:12:55,756
<i>Romeo, don't leave, please.</i>
<i>Please, no, no!</i>

200
00:12:55,829 --> 00:12:58,821
<i>Eugene!</i>

201
00:13:10,344 --> 00:13:13,279
It looks as though the happy event
is about to begin.

202
00:13:14,514 --> 00:13:17,142
I worked hard my whole life.

203
00:13:17,217 --> 00:13:22,849
I started out at 13 selling cheap porcelain
nicknacks door-to-door.

204
00:13:22,923 --> 00:13:25,118
<i>You know how hard that is?</i>

205
00:13:25,192 --> 00:13:27,183
After she marries
that nose-picking "jibony"...

206
00:13:27,260 --> 00:13:29,956
<i>I can kiss my political career</i>
<i>good-bye.</i>

207
00:13:30,030 --> 00:13:32,260
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

208
00:13:32,332 --> 00:13:35,859
And you can kiss taking over
Humphrey Industries good-bye.

209
00:13:37,804 --> 00:13:41,706
<i>It's amazing he'll let you live there.</i>
<i>You'll have your own computer room.</i>

210
00:13:41,775 --> 00:13:44,801
You know, there's two days
before the wedding.

211
00:13:44,878 --> 00:13:47,870
- A lot of things could happen.
- Like what?

212
00:13:47,948 --> 00:13:51,645
Engagements get canceled
all the time for all sorts of reasons.

213
00:13:51,718 --> 00:13:53,709
You mean break up the wedding?

214
00:13:53,787 --> 00:13:56,585
We all want what's best
for the family.

215
00:13:56,656 --> 00:13:59,181
Break up my daughter's wedding?

216
00:13:59,259 --> 00:14:01,853
Don't even think about it.
You got a nasty mind, Chip.

217
00:14:01,928 --> 00:14:04,726
I hate when you have a nasty mind.
Break up my daughter's wedding.

218
00:14:04,798 --> 00:14:06,732
Geez.

219
00:14:09,302 --> 00:14:13,830
In addition to ruining any chance
of a political career...

220
00:14:13,907 --> 00:14:15,602
think for one minute...

221
00:14:15,675 --> 00:14:18,576
what this will do
to the family tree.

222
00:14:32,225 --> 00:14:35,524
You can pick your friends,
you can pick your nose...

223
00:14:35,595 --> 00:14:38,291
but you can't pick your relatives.

224
00:14:43,003 --> 00:14:45,130
Do whatever you have to do.

225
00:14:56,450 --> 00:14:58,918
Smile pretty. Smile pretty.

226
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:00,919
Thank you.

227
00:15:00,987 --> 00:15:03,387
Name tags.
Name tags, anyone?

228
00:15:03,457 --> 00:15:05,982
<i>Right there. Right there, a picture.</i>

229
00:15:06,059 --> 00:15:09,722
Excuse me. Would you like
a"Hello. My name is" tag?

230
00:15:09,796 --> 00:15:11,667
How nerdy can you get?

231
00:15:11,801 --> 00:15:15,396
Lois, what on earth
are all these nerds doing here?

232
00:15:15,471 --> 00:15:17,405
They're Booger's friends.

233
00:15:17,473 --> 00:15:20,931
Well, Aaron and Tippy must just be sick.

234
00:15:21,010 --> 00:15:23,672
Oh, Tippy seems okay,
but it's killing my brother.

235
00:15:26,315 --> 00:15:28,249
Daddy.

236
00:15:28,317 --> 00:15:30,342
Hi. Lewis Skolnick, best man.

237
00:15:31,721 --> 00:15:35,122
- Figures.
- Booger is just crazy about your daughter.

238
00:15:35,191 --> 00:15:38,422
He's gonna make a wonderful husband,
and that's all that really matters.

239
00:15:38,494 --> 00:15:40,462
- Right.
- Once you get to know Booger...

240
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:43,192
you'll be very happy with what you see.

241
00:15:43,266 --> 00:15:46,394
I'll be very happy
when I get away from you.

242
00:15:49,439 --> 00:15:52,033
<i>Aaron, my dear man, I'm so sorry.</i>

243
00:15:55,278 --> 00:16:00,238
You know, Booger, I do sense a bit
of friction with your future father-in-law.

244
00:16:00,316 --> 00:16:02,250
- Friction?
- Mm-hmm.

245
00:16:02,318 --> 00:16:04,252
He hates my guts.

246
00:16:05,888 --> 00:16:08,880
Say hi to Stan.
Stan, this is Lewis. Come in.

247
00:16:08,958 --> 00:16:11,256
I read you.
I read you, Lewis. Over.

248
00:16:11,327 --> 00:16:14,387
Yeah, I just wanted to see
how you're feeling, man.

249
00:16:14,464 --> 00:16:17,763
Oh, pretty good. Just such a bummer
I got the chicken pox.

250
00:16:17,834 --> 00:16:21,270
I guess I was just too cool
to get them as a kid.

251
00:16:21,337 --> 00:16:24,670
You know, sometimes we just have
to play the cards we're dealt.

252
00:16:24,740 --> 00:16:29,177
Yeah. You're always so perceptive, Lewis.
I wish I could be like you.

253
00:16:29,245 --> 00:16:31,372
Give it time, Stan.
Over and out.

254
00:16:34,350 --> 00:16:38,753
Excuse me, Mr. Lewis, Mr. Booger.

255
00:16:38,821 --> 00:16:41,449
Why is that buttocks
squished up against the window...

256
00:16:41,524 --> 00:16:43,890
like a pressed Devonshire ham?

257
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,861
Ogre!

258
00:16:48,264 --> 00:16:50,789
- Lewey!
- Ogre! How are you?

259
00:16:50,867 --> 00:16:53,097
- How you doing? See it?
- Yeah, I saw it.

260
00:16:53,169 --> 00:16:55,194
- That's Ogre.
- Oh.

261
00:16:55,271 --> 00:16:58,934
- Ogre!
- Little buddy! How you doing?

262
00:16:59,008 --> 00:17:01,806
Ogre! Ogre! Ogre!

263
00:17:01,878 --> 00:17:06,212
Ogre! Ogre! Ogre!
Ogre! Ogre!

264
00:17:06,282 --> 00:17:08,876
This is the worst party
we've ever been to. Good night.

265
00:17:08,951 --> 00:17:12,717
This was unbelievable.
Thank God my daughter's a lesbian.

266
00:17:14,123 --> 00:17:16,717
- Ogre! Ogre!
- Hey, did you see my buns?

267
00:17:16,792 --> 00:17:21,126
- Uh-oh.
- What? Who is it?

268
00:17:21,197 --> 00:17:23,791
- Mylan Whitfield.
- Huh?

269
00:17:23,866 --> 00:17:26,096
The chairman
of the Republican party.

270
00:17:30,339 --> 00:17:32,807
Nice of you to come, Mylan.
Could I get you a drink?

271
00:17:32,875 --> 00:17:35,571
The strongest one you've got.

272
00:17:49,058 --> 00:17:52,687
I think this is a record.

273
00:17:52,762 --> 00:17:55,492
<i>The world's champ.</i>

274
00:17:56,866 --> 00:17:59,198
I drink to that.

275
00:17:59,268 --> 00:18:02,431
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you.

276
00:18:02,505 --> 00:18:05,030
That's your future son-in-law.

277
00:18:05,107 --> 00:18:08,508
<i>And now a very special treat.</i>

278
00:18:10,046 --> 00:18:14,506
- My fiancÃ©e's turn.
- Oh.

279
00:18:14,584 --> 00:18:19,180
Oh, no, Jeanie, please.
Don't do it, please. Please, don't, please.

280
00:18:19,255 --> 00:18:23,351
Okay. Okay.

281
00:18:23,426 --> 00:18:25,223
Don't do it, please.
Don't do it.

282
00:18:34,537 --> 00:18:38,735
She's doing a good job.

283
00:18:38,808 --> 00:18:41,038
Booger must be so proud.

284
00:18:43,879 --> 00:18:45,813
- Wow!
- Can you believe it?

285
00:18:48,651 --> 00:18:52,246
- Whoo!
- She's got the croup.

286
00:18:53,823 --> 00:18:57,816
<i>MyJeanie, she can belch</i>
<i>with the best of them.</i>

287
00:19:01,230 --> 00:19:05,189
Hey, your sorority sisters are here.
It's the Omega Mu's.

288
00:19:13,175 --> 00:19:15,370
They're all voters, Mylan.

289
00:19:16,545 --> 00:19:18,240
Booger! Booger! Booger!

290
00:19:18,314 --> 00:19:22,341
Thank you. Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

291
00:19:22,418 --> 00:19:24,682
Why are they always chanting?

292
00:19:24,754 --> 00:19:29,987
You see, the younger
generation today, they- they-

293
00:19:30,059 --> 00:19:32,323
I think it's kind of fun.

294
00:19:32,395 --> 00:19:34,420
You're wearing two different socks.

295
00:19:35,765 --> 00:19:38,427
<i>Well, I wanna welcome you all</i>
<i>to the wedding...</i>

296
00:19:38,501 --> 00:19:40,435
that none of us
ever thought would happen.

297
00:19:40,503 --> 00:19:44,803
<i>I guess hell must have frozen over after all.</i>

298
00:19:47,543 --> 00:19:50,637
Come on now.

299
00:19:50,713 --> 00:19:52,772
Boom!

300
00:19:52,848 --> 00:19:56,545
<i>But, Jeanie,</i>
<i>you don't know about this...</i>

301
00:19:56,619 --> 00:20:00,055
but I'm going to sing
a little song for you.

302
00:20:00,122 --> 00:20:05,287
<i>It's something that I think of</i>
<i>whenever I think of you.</i>

303
00:21:08,257 --> 00:21:10,953
- Sorry, Aaron, gotta go.
- You will come to the bridal shower?

304
00:21:11,026 --> 00:21:13,551
No can do.
Important engagement.

305
00:21:16,766 --> 00:21:19,428
- I thought you were gonna do something.
- I'm working on it.

306
00:21:19,502 --> 00:21:23,370
- I'm gonna start first thing in the morning.
- Start now, doofus.

307
00:21:27,376 --> 00:21:29,037
Oh.

308
00:21:34,950 --> 00:21:37,077
For those of you
in the audience here...

309
00:21:37,153 --> 00:21:40,680
who are blues aficionados,
we have a little, uh-

310
00:21:40,756 --> 00:21:43,691
It's a little bit dissonant,
but I think you'll like it...

311
00:21:43,759 --> 00:21:46,626
'cause with the fluteophones,
it's kind of special.

312
00:21:46,695 --> 00:21:49,562
Flutes up.

313
00:21:49,632 --> 00:21:53,591
A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three.

314
00:21:53,669 --> 00:21:55,660
Even I can't take this. Good night.

315
00:22:36,879 --> 00:22:39,143
- Hey, can I cut in?
- Sure thing.

316
00:22:41,350 --> 00:22:44,080
If I may.

317
00:22:44,153 --> 00:22:48,749
Betty, pregnant women
have always made me boggy.

318
00:22:48,824 --> 00:22:52,692
Oh, Booger.
You're just incorrigible.

319
00:22:52,761 --> 00:22:56,822
- I try to be.
- Excuse me.

320
00:22:56,899 --> 00:23:01,131
I just want you to know
that I'm really happy for you.

321
00:23:01,203 --> 00:23:03,967
<i>Booger lets you be yourself...</i>

322
00:23:04,039 --> 00:23:07,566
and I really like what I see.

323
00:23:07,643 --> 00:23:11,579
<i>I can't believe this is coming</i>
<i>out of the mouth of my perfect sister.</i>

324
00:23:11,647 --> 00:23:15,743
Who knows, maybe this wedding
has really brought us together.

325
00:23:17,453 --> 00:23:19,921
I love you, Jeanie.

326
00:23:19,989 --> 00:23:22,082
I love you, Gaylord.

327
00:23:22,157 --> 00:23:25,649
Oh!

328
00:23:28,597 --> 00:23:32,089
Oh, girls.

329
00:23:32,167 --> 00:23:35,398
Once you go nerd,
you'll never go back.

330
00:23:39,108 --> 00:23:42,271
I would just die
for your cheekbones.

331
00:23:42,344 --> 00:23:44,403
Oh.

332
00:23:49,551 --> 00:23:51,849
Hey, handsome.

333
00:23:53,188 --> 00:23:55,349
Wanna dance?

334
00:23:55,424 --> 00:23:57,892
Sure.

335
00:24:07,703 --> 00:24:10,763
<i>Good show, Harold.</i>

336
00:24:25,688 --> 00:24:28,350
What a prenuptial party.

337
00:24:28,424 --> 00:24:32,383
Really, so enjoyable. Just tremendous.

338
00:24:38,467 --> 00:24:41,994
<i>Jeanie and her friends</i>
<i>are having a good time.</i>

339
00:24:42,071 --> 00:24:44,562
Everybody who's important is gone.

340
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:48,440
- What an embarrassment.
- No, no, no, look. Your sister's still here.

341
00:24:51,747 --> 00:24:55,080
My sister stays to the end
of supermarket openings.

342
00:24:55,150 --> 00:24:58,085
<i>Hey, Takashi,</i>
<i>whatever happened to Gilbert?</i>

343
00:24:58,153 --> 00:25:00,553
- Mrs. Humphrey, can I have this dance?
- Yes?

344
00:25:00,622 --> 00:25:03,489
- Oh, I don't think I could.
- I think you could.

345
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:06,528
There's a little nerd in everyone.

346
00:25:08,097 --> 00:25:10,190
There's no nerd in me, pal.

347
00:25:21,243 --> 00:25:24,178
Yo! Mama-san!

348
00:25:25,981 --> 00:25:29,508
Lois, wait!

349
00:25:47,302 --> 00:25:49,463
<i>Hey, you nerds really know how to party.</i>

350
00:25:51,974 --> 00:25:53,965
<i>I'm just getting started, baby.</i>

351
00:25:54,043 --> 00:25:57,069
Romeo, have you seen Chip?

352
00:25:57,146 --> 00:26:01,344
Oh, sure, that's exactly what I have on my mind,
worrying about where Chip is.

353
00:26:01,417 --> 00:26:05,114
Oh, gee, where could Chip be?
Here, Chip, Chip, Chip, Chip.

354
00:26:05,187 --> 00:26:07,849
Here, Chip, Chip, Chip,
Chip, Chip, Chip.

355
00:26:07,923 --> 00:26:10,585
How would you like to lose
about 12 teeth?

356
00:26:11,660 --> 00:26:13,594
Bitch.

357
00:26:20,235 --> 00:26:22,760
<i>I'm looking for dirt, scandal...</i>

358
00:26:22,838 --> 00:26:24,863
some deviant behavior...

359
00:26:24,940 --> 00:26:28,467
a skeleton in a closet
that would be so horrible...

360
00:26:28,544 --> 00:26:30,774
it would break up a wedding.

361
00:26:30,846 --> 00:26:32,780
And money's no object.

362
00:26:32,848 --> 00:26:35,180
How did you find me?

363
00:26:35,250 --> 00:26:37,013
Let's just say through a friend.

364
00:26:37,086 --> 00:26:39,111
And why do you wanna ruin
the wedding?

365
00:26:39,188 --> 00:26:41,986
Well, my father-in-law's thinking
of getting into politics...

366
00:26:42,057 --> 00:26:44,048
and the groom
would ruin his chances.

367
00:26:44,126 --> 00:26:46,617
If the father-in-law doesn't enter
the political arena...

368
00:26:46,695 --> 00:26:48,720
you don't take over
the family business.

369
00:26:48,797 --> 00:26:53,530
Yes. Well, I suppose that would happen,
but that's not my major concern.

370
00:26:54,770 --> 00:26:58,900
- It's nerds, isn't it?
- How did you know that?

371
00:26:58,974 --> 00:27:02,137
- I'm a detective.
- Wow.

372
00:27:02,211 --> 00:27:05,738
I had a case with nerds
a couple months ago.

373
00:27:05,814 --> 00:27:09,215
They can be very slippery.

374
00:27:09,284 --> 00:27:11,047
How do I know you're any good?

375
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:13,588
You know the dirt on the royal family?

376
00:27:13,655 --> 00:27:16,215
You?

377
00:27:16,291 --> 00:27:18,384
Well, let's do business.

378
00:27:18,460 --> 00:27:20,394
All right.

379
00:27:24,366 --> 00:27:26,960
- What's the groom's name?
- Uh, Dudley Dawson.

380
00:27:27,035 --> 00:27:29,230
But his friends call him "Booger."

381
00:27:30,806 --> 00:27:33,673
- Well, that's the first thing in our favor.
- What's that?

382
00:27:33,742 --> 00:27:39,271
With a name like Booger, it shouldn't be
too hard to get dirt on him. Right?

383
00:27:40,382 --> 00:27:42,316
<i>Good night, Mr. Ogre.</i>

384
00:27:44,353 --> 00:27:46,321
<i>Good night, Trevor.</i>

385
00:27:46,388 --> 00:27:48,413
<i>Good night, Lamar.</i>

386
00:27:48,490 --> 00:27:50,924
- <i>Good night, Judy.</i>
- <i>Good night, Stan.</i>

387
00:27:50,993 --> 00:27:53,359
<i>Good night, Takashi.</i>

388
00:27:55,130 --> 00:27:58,964
Betty.

389
00:27:59,034 --> 00:28:01,867
- <i>Hmm?</i>
- Why can't we videotape the birth?

390
00:28:01,937 --> 00:28:05,270
I just don't want the whole world
to see my privates.

391
00:28:05,340 --> 00:28:07,808
But I've already bought
a high-definition...

392
00:28:07,876 --> 00:28:10,208
Dolby stereo, 3-D helmet cam.

393
00:28:11,813 --> 00:28:14,475
You know you'll show
the video to someone.

394
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,747
I'm really surprised at you, Betty.

395
00:28:17,819 --> 00:28:21,448
Not having the confidence to think that
I wouldn't show the video to someone.

396
00:28:25,527 --> 00:28:27,461
Maybe I would.

397
00:28:28,630 --> 00:28:30,962
- I probably would.
- Hmm.

398
00:28:31,033 --> 00:28:34,662
I definitely would, but it's only
because no one is prouder than I am...

399
00:28:34,736 --> 00:28:37,204
of our unborn fetal son.

400
00:28:37,272 --> 00:28:39,297
And your privates.

401
00:28:39,374 --> 00:28:42,639
Lewis Tarada Skolnick!

402
00:28:42,711 --> 00:28:44,702
Ow! Betty, I was only kidding.

403
00:28:44,780 --> 00:28:47,214
- Ow!
- Are you all right, honey?

404
00:28:47,282 --> 00:28:50,581
I'm fine.
I just have a little side ache.

405
00:28:53,989 --> 00:28:56,355
You are so wonderful.

406
00:28:56,425 --> 00:28:58,655
I bet I'm the only woman
in America...

407
00:28:58,727 --> 00:29:02,163
to have a certified midwife
as a husband.

408
00:29:02,231 --> 00:29:06,725
That's because I don't want anybody but me
delivering our unborn baby son.

409
00:29:06,802 --> 00:29:09,327
Hey, Betty.

410
00:29:09,404 --> 00:29:12,168
- Hmm?
- Would you like to have
some pickles and ice cream?

411
00:29:12,241 --> 00:29:14,106
Pickles, ice cream.
Pickles, ice cream.

412
00:29:14,176 --> 00:29:16,440
I would love
some pickles and ice cream.

413
00:29:16,511 --> 00:29:19,002
- Oh, yea!
- I'll be right back.

414
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:24,513
Oh, honey, I don't want you
to go now. It's after 3:00.

415
00:29:24,586 --> 00:29:27,350
If my unborn fetal son
and my beloved wife...

416
00:29:27,422 --> 00:29:30,016
want pickles and ice cream,
I don't care what time it is.

417
00:29:30,092 --> 00:29:32,424
Eskimo kiss?

418
00:29:32,494 --> 00:29:34,553
- Butterfly.
- Eskimo.

419
00:29:34,630 --> 00:29:38,031
- Butterfly. Butterfly.
- Eskimo. Eskimo.

420
00:29:40,869 --> 00:29:43,360
I love you, you big nerd.

421
00:29:43,438 --> 00:29:47,704
I know you are, but what am I?

422
00:29:50,178 --> 00:29:53,147
- Booger.
- Hey, Lewis. Where you going?

423
00:29:53,215 --> 00:29:55,581
I was just gonna take a cruise
in the party truck...

424
00:29:55,651 --> 00:29:57,585
and get Betty
some pickles and ice cream.

425
00:29:57,653 --> 00:30:01,419
- You're gonna make the best father.
- You really think so?

426
00:30:02,491 --> 00:30:04,240
I know so.

427
00:30:04,374 --> 00:30:06,399
Hey, you wanna come with?

428
00:30:06,476 --> 00:30:08,740
No.

429
00:30:10,613 --> 00:30:13,241
Are you feeling all right, Booger?

430
00:30:13,316 --> 00:30:15,511
Lewis, I'm gonna say
something to you...

431
00:30:15,585 --> 00:30:18,247
that I would never tell
anybody else in the world.

432
00:30:23,526 --> 00:30:25,460
I'm a little scared.

433
00:30:25,528 --> 00:30:27,519
Scared? You?

434
00:30:29,199 --> 00:30:31,258
Well, what are you
scared about, Booger?

435
00:30:33,470 --> 00:30:37,338
I've been single a long time, Lewis.

436
00:30:37,407 --> 00:30:40,774
I've enjoyed a lot of Mu's.

437
00:30:40,844 --> 00:30:42,778
My life has been blessed.

438
00:30:42,846 --> 00:30:46,441
And they've enjoyed you too, pal.

439
00:30:46,516 --> 00:30:49,644
Now I'm hanging it all up.

440
00:30:49,719 --> 00:30:54,850
But what happens if I run into
a woman who really curdles my blood?

441
00:30:54,924 --> 00:30:57,722
'Cause you know me, Lewis.
You know how it is.

442
00:30:57,794 --> 00:31:02,060
Our eyes meet across
a crowded room, and bammo.

443
00:31:03,066 --> 00:31:05,466
We're talkin' "nutso" time.

444
00:31:05,535 --> 00:31:09,437
Bananas.
We're talking out of my brains...

445
00:31:09,506 --> 00:31:12,737
can't control the faculties,
the mind follows the genitals time.

446
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:14,743
Because that's
what happens, Lewis...

447
00:31:14,811 --> 00:31:20,306
anytime I meet a woman who really
makes me wanna take a bath.

448
00:31:20,383 --> 00:31:24,183
Well, I have manly urges too, Booger,
like any other red-blooded American male.

449
00:31:24,254 --> 00:31:27,155
Well, of course you do.
How do you handle it?

450
00:31:27,223 --> 00:31:29,817
I just think of Betty or computers.

451
00:31:29,893 --> 00:31:33,351
No, see, not me.

452
00:31:35,265 --> 00:31:39,395
I'm like a train wreck
on the Long Island Railroad.

453
00:31:39,469 --> 00:31:44,998
I may see trouble down the tracks,
but this trainman can't pull the switch.

454
00:31:45,075 --> 00:31:47,669
Well, nobody likes to party
more than I do, Booger.

455
00:31:47,744 --> 00:31:50,008
Except for maybe you.

456
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,540
But my life got so much better since
I married Betty. And yours is going to too.

457
00:31:54,617 --> 00:31:57,017
<i>Provided you're ready</i>
<i>to compromise...</i>

458
00:31:57,087 --> 00:32:00,545
and work hard, incredibly hard,
on your impending union with Jean.

459
00:32:00,623 --> 00:32:02,784
You have to work really hard, huh?

460
00:32:02,859 --> 00:32:07,023
It's not any harder than, say, designing cornering
velocities for theJapanese Bullet Train.

461
00:32:07,097 --> 00:32:11,124
<i>But you should get some sleep.</i>
<i>Tomorrow is a huge day for you.</i>

462
00:32:11,201 --> 00:32:15,069
You got the all-you-can-eat nerd
bridal shower at the Rump Roast Room.

463
00:32:15,138 --> 00:32:19,336
<i>And then there's my surprise theme</i>
<i>bachelor stag party at night.</i>

464
00:32:19,409 --> 00:32:21,377
You forgot about that, didn't you?

465
00:32:22,445 --> 00:32:24,413
You're gonna nail me, aren't you?

466
00:32:24,481 --> 00:32:27,712
You're darn tootin'.
See ya, Booger.

467
00:32:27,784 --> 00:32:30,753
- Hey, Lewis.
- Yeah?

468
00:32:31,821 --> 00:32:33,721
Thanks.

469
00:32:35,992 --> 00:32:37,926
I love you, Booger.

470
00:32:39,229 --> 00:32:41,163
I love you too.

471
00:33:03,052 --> 00:33:04,986
Bibs, anyone?

472
00:33:05,054 --> 00:33:06,988
<i>Don't be bashful. It's all you can eat.</i>

473
00:33:07,056 --> 00:33:10,924
So, Russia's in,
you know, bad shape.

474
00:33:10,994 --> 00:33:14,088
Decentralization of the economy
and the privatization of industry...

475
00:33:14,164 --> 00:33:16,632
while, you know, leading
to these personal freedoms...

476
00:33:16,699 --> 00:33:18,724
it's cost some great hardships.

477
00:33:18,801 --> 00:33:23,170
That's why I, Ogre, I think I'm gonna
go over there and see if I can help them out.

478
00:33:23,239 --> 00:33:25,764
You know what I mean?
That's no good.

479
00:33:33,516 --> 00:33:36,644
- What the fu-
- Say "cheese."

480
00:33:36,719 --> 00:33:40,951
- Cheese.
- <i>Okay, now stay there.</i>

481
00:33:43,026 --> 00:33:46,621
- Lewis to Stan. Come in, Stan.
- I read you Lewis. Over.

482
00:33:46,696 --> 00:33:49,790
Uh, listen. This is your 2:00 pox report.
How you feeling, Stan?

483
00:33:49,866 --> 00:33:52,630
Much better now, thanks toJudy.

484
00:33:52,702 --> 00:33:55,796
If you don't take care of the pox,
they can scab and leave scars.

485
00:33:55,872 --> 00:33:58,363
- Over and out.
- Honey.

486
00:33:58,441 --> 00:34:01,672
- Hmm?
- What's Trevor Gulf doing?

487
00:34:01,744 --> 00:34:04,304
L-I think he's mooning us.

488
00:34:04,380 --> 00:34:06,314
That's not a moon.
That's the San Joaquin Valley.

489
00:34:06,382 --> 00:34:10,512
- Trevor, no!
- Oh, big smile.

490
00:34:10,587 --> 00:34:14,387
Trevor, come on.
It isn't nice to moon.

491
00:34:14,457 --> 00:34:17,756
- <i>Oh, it isn't?</i>
- No, it isn't.

492
00:34:17,827 --> 00:34:21,285
- Mr. Ogre mooned.
- Well, you see, Trevor...

493
00:34:21,364 --> 00:34:24,162
Mr. Ogre's a converted nerd, okay?

494
00:34:24,234 --> 00:34:28,364
He used to be a jock.
He's still a little rough around the edges.

495
00:34:28,438 --> 00:34:31,100
Jacques?
Is he from France?

496
00:34:35,778 --> 00:34:39,646
- My condolences, Aaron.
- You gotta take the good with the bad.

497
00:34:39,716 --> 00:34:42,947
- Sorry, Aaron.
- Hey, if it's not one thing, it's another.

498
00:34:43,987 --> 00:34:46,182
Mylan, thank you for coming.

499
00:34:46,256 --> 00:34:48,190
Thank you for sending
the limo for me.

500
00:34:48,258 --> 00:34:51,022
Thank you for sending
the bauble to my secretary.

501
00:34:51,094 --> 00:34:54,257
And the entire party thanks you
for sending the check.

502
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:57,561
Just being a good Republican, Mylan.

503
00:34:57,634 --> 00:35:00,194
Come along, dear.

504
00:35:00,270 --> 00:35:02,431
Nice seeing you again, Flo.

505
00:35:05,675 --> 00:35:09,042
- I've done a little homework
on Dudley "Booger" Dawson.
- Oh, yeah?

506
00:35:09,112 --> 00:35:11,444
- He's an attorney all right.
- Well, that's good.

507
00:35:11,514 --> 00:35:13,607
A personal injury attorney.

508
00:35:13,683 --> 00:35:16,243
He's an ambulance chaser?

509
00:35:17,453 --> 00:35:20,115
It just gets worse.

510
00:35:20,189 --> 00:35:23,625
- Well, it'll all be over soon.
- What are you gonna do?

511
00:35:23,693 --> 00:35:26,355
You just get ready for a bombshell.

512
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:32,768
Ogre, thanks, man.

513
00:35:32,835 --> 00:35:35,895
That's-That's really thoughtful.

514
00:35:35,972 --> 00:35:37,906
It was really expensive.

515
00:35:37,974 --> 00:35:43,674
<i>So, uh, I guess it's on to Lewis</i>
<i>and Betty's present, huh?</i>

516
00:35:49,852 --> 00:35:52,047
Oh, wow!

517
00:35:52,121 --> 00:35:56,251
- <i>Look at that.</i>
- A ski exerciser!

518
00:35:56,326 --> 00:35:59,352
<i>I've been dying for one of these!</i>

519
00:35:59,429 --> 00:36:02,956
- Have you?
- Boss!

520
00:36:03,032 --> 00:36:06,263
They now have anything
ever sold on an infomercial.

521
00:36:06,336 --> 00:36:08,270
Oh, shut up, Aaron.

522
00:36:08,338 --> 00:36:12,297
Hey, everybody, everybody,
Booger's parents are here!

523
00:36:12,375 --> 00:36:16,812
Mr. And Mrs. Booger!
Mr. And Mrs. Booger!

524
00:36:16,879 --> 00:36:20,110
Mom? Dad!

525
00:36:23,453 --> 00:36:25,944
They look like they just
fell off a pickle truck.

526
00:36:26,022 --> 00:36:29,219
- Chip!
- Folks, everybody, excuse me.

527
00:36:29,292 --> 00:36:31,226
These are my parents.

528
00:36:36,699 --> 00:36:40,135
We're so glad that you're here,
Mr. And Mrs. Dawson.

529
00:36:43,606 --> 00:36:46,234
I am flabbergasted.

530
00:36:46,309 --> 00:36:50,473
We would both like to thank all of you
from the bottom of our hearts...

531
00:36:50,546 --> 00:36:53,811
<i>for this wonderful shower</i>
<i>you're throwing us.</i>

532
00:36:53,883 --> 00:36:57,979
It's probably the first shower he's ever had.

533
00:37:01,224 --> 00:37:04,591
<i>No, he showered regularly.</i>
<i>Every other night in the summer...</i>

534
00:37:04,660 --> 00:37:06,594
and weekly in the winter.

535
00:37:15,405 --> 00:37:19,671
Well, I don't know about you guys,
but I'm ready to jump off the dock.

536
00:37:19,742 --> 00:37:24,111
- Yeah!
- Hold it, everybody.

537
00:37:24,180 --> 00:37:27,172
I'd like to offer my toast.

538
00:37:27,250 --> 00:37:29,718
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

539
00:37:33,923 --> 00:37:36,790
To Booger's love child.

540
00:37:39,529 --> 00:37:41,861
Love child?
What are you talking about?

541
00:37:43,533 --> 00:37:46,058
I'm talking about the daughter
you had 12 years ago...

542
00:37:46,135 --> 00:37:49,229
out of wedlock, with a young woman
in Sandusky, Ohio.

543
00:37:49,305 --> 00:37:52,035
<i>All right, Booger!</i>
<i>Yeah, bud!</i>

544
00:37:54,977 --> 00:38:00,882
You have a child that my little girl
doesn't know about?

545
00:38:00,950 --> 00:38:03,475
I am appalled, Booger.
Appalled.

546
00:38:03,553 --> 00:38:06,716
- And so is my wife. Right? See?
- But-

547
00:38:06,789 --> 00:38:08,723
I don't know anything about this.

548
00:38:08,791 --> 00:38:11,589
I have no child in Sandusky, Ohio.

549
00:38:11,661 --> 00:38:14,323
The hell you don't!

550
00:38:14,397 --> 00:38:17,059
This is a fairly specious charge.

551
00:38:17,133 --> 00:38:19,567
Where's your proof, Chip?

552
00:38:19,635 --> 00:38:22,570
- Yeah, where's your proof, Chip?
- Yeah.

553
00:38:24,307 --> 00:38:26,241
My proof is right here.

554
00:38:28,077 --> 00:38:32,070
I'd like you to meet
Detective First Class Chad Penrod.

555
00:38:32,148 --> 00:38:36,608
Detective Penrod,
does Dudley Dawson, alias Booger...

556
00:38:36,686 --> 00:38:41,646
have or have not a 12-year-old child
in Sandusky, Ohio?

557
00:38:41,724 --> 00:38:44,625
I checked the birth records
in Sandusky and found...

558
00:38:44,694 --> 00:38:47,128
<i>that on March 19, 1981...</i>

559
00:38:47,196 --> 00:38:49,596
a certain Heidi Dawson...

560
00:38:49,665 --> 00:38:52,327
was born to
a Miss Cathleen Turtle-

561
00:38:52,401 --> 00:38:56,303
Turtletaub and a Mr. Dudley Dawson.

562
00:38:56,372 --> 00:38:58,806
- Cool.
- Wait!

563
00:38:58,875 --> 00:39:02,436
If the parents of the alleged love child
were never married...

564
00:39:02,512 --> 00:39:07,279
why isn't the child's name
Heidi Turtletaub?

565
00:39:07,350 --> 00:39:11,787
Exactly. Why isn't the child's name
Heidi Turtletaub?

566
00:39:11,854 --> 00:39:14,118
Yes.

567
00:39:15,458 --> 00:39:17,392
Beats me.

568
00:39:17,460 --> 00:39:20,896
If the child were born
to an unmarried mother...

569
00:39:20,963 --> 00:39:26,333
wouldn't the so-said mother haven't given
the aforementioned daughter her last name?

570
00:39:27,703 --> 00:39:29,637
<i>Well, I do know this.</i>

571
00:39:29,705 --> 00:39:32,731
The child's nickname is Booger.

572
00:39:32,808 --> 00:39:35,174
Yeah!

573
00:39:35,244 --> 00:39:37,474
I think we should leave, Jeanie.

574
00:39:37,547 --> 00:39:40,175
Oh.

575
00:39:40,249 --> 00:39:43,343
Do you wanna marry a man
who doesn't tell you that he has a child?

576
00:39:43,419 --> 00:39:45,979
<i>Who knows what he'll lie about next?</i>

577
00:39:46,055 --> 00:39:48,683
You saw <i>The Crying Game.</i>

578
00:39:48,758 --> 00:39:51,591
How do we know he even is a man?

579
00:39:53,763 --> 00:39:56,493
<i>Don't you touch me!</i>

580
00:39:56,632 --> 00:39:58,998
Get your hands off me!
Don't you touch me!

581
00:39:59,068 --> 00:40:00,592
<i>I caught you red-handed!</i>

582
00:40:00,670 --> 00:40:02,604
- Get off of me!
- Hey, break it up!

583
00:40:02,672 --> 00:40:06,608
- Break it up!
- I'm gonna tell everybody!
Don't you get me started.

584
00:40:06,676 --> 00:40:08,610
- I heard-
- Word!

585
00:40:08,678 --> 00:40:12,045
I can't believe what got into you two.
This is supposed to be a happy occasion.

586
00:40:13,883 --> 00:40:16,750
I'm especially surprised
at you, Lamar.

587
00:40:16,819 --> 00:40:19,083
Now what was going on?

588
00:40:19,155 --> 00:40:22,022
Well, Chip was crackin'
on Booger's parents.

589
00:40:22,091 --> 00:40:24,457
Crackin' on my parents?

590
00:40:26,128 --> 00:40:28,289
What kind of cracks, Chip?

591
00:40:28,364 --> 00:40:31,458
Booger.

592
00:40:31,534 --> 00:40:35,265
- As your best man, I strongly advise just let it go.
- I'm not going to let it go.

593
00:40:35,338 --> 00:40:38,535
On the other hand, I'm prepared to explore
other avenues with you as well.

594
00:40:38,608 --> 00:40:41,805
What kind of cracks, Chip?

595
00:40:41,877 --> 00:40:45,574
Chip said that your mama was so ugly,
that the Elephant Man paid to see her.

596
00:40:51,721 --> 00:40:57,091
The point is you have
a 12-year-old daughter in Sandusky, Ohio!

597
00:40:57,159 --> 00:41:01,095
This has nothing to do
with my having a child in Sandusky, Ohio.

598
00:41:01,163 --> 00:41:03,393
That isn't what
this is about at all.

599
00:41:04,834 --> 00:41:08,326
This is because I'm a nerd.

600
00:41:09,505 --> 00:41:11,439
And it has been since the beginning.

601
00:41:11,507 --> 00:41:13,441
Mm-hmm.

602
00:41:13,509 --> 00:41:16,910
Why else would someone rummage
through my private life with a detective?

603
00:41:16,979 --> 00:41:21,916
And then announce this...
detestable fabrication...

604
00:41:21,984 --> 00:41:25,579
this- this- this tissue of lies...

605
00:41:25,655 --> 00:41:28,852
- on the happiest day of my life?
- Oh, Booger.

606
00:41:30,526 --> 00:41:33,427
Hath not a nerd eyes?

607
00:41:34,930 --> 00:41:37,194
When you prick us,
do we not bleed?

608
00:41:38,668 --> 00:41:42,502
I am tired
of the reckless allegations...

609
00:41:42,571 --> 00:41:44,596
the snide snickering...

610
00:41:44,674 --> 00:41:47,939
<i>the talking behind backs,</i>
<i>the sly innuendoes...</i>

611
00:41:48,010 --> 00:41:50,535
the looking down on us.

612
00:41:53,783 --> 00:41:56,877
We are what we are.

613
00:41:56,952 --> 00:41:59,318
- Aren't we?
- We are!

614
00:41:59,388 --> 00:42:02,949
- And we're proud of what we are.
- We are!

615
00:42:03,025 --> 00:42:06,358
And we are not about
to allow ourselves...

616
00:42:06,429 --> 00:42:09,489
to be intimidated
by a bunch of-

617
00:42:09,565 --> 00:42:12,466
Booger, don't say it!

618
00:42:12,535 --> 00:42:17,495
- Say it, Booger!
- Nouveau-riche pigs!

619
00:42:19,408 --> 00:42:21,342
<i>There you go.</i>

620
00:42:22,745 --> 00:42:27,341
You have... the audacity...

621
00:42:27,416 --> 00:42:30,146
to utter the most...

622
00:42:30,219 --> 00:42:33,814
<i>morally reprehensible slur</i>
<i>to these...</i>

623
00:42:35,157 --> 00:42:37,921
fine, upstanding...

624
00:42:37,993 --> 00:42:40,484
self-made businesspeople.

625
00:42:42,431 --> 00:42:45,127
Shame on you, Booger.

626
00:42:45,201 --> 00:42:47,260
Shame on all of you nerds.

627
00:42:47,336 --> 00:42:48,826
Ogre, no!

628
00:43:00,282 --> 00:43:02,512
The prosecution rests.

629
00:43:02,585 --> 00:43:05,679
I've had it with you nerds!

630
00:43:07,123 --> 00:43:09,114
All right, everyone, just cool it!

631
00:43:12,361 --> 00:43:15,888
- Oh, what the hell.
- We've got too much class for this kind of crap.

632
00:43:16,932 --> 00:43:19,196
- Booger!
- Jeanie!

633
00:43:19,268 --> 00:43:24,365
Booger!

634
00:44:06,949 --> 00:44:10,180
So you might have a daughter
in Sandusky, Ohio, huh?

635
00:44:13,222 --> 00:44:16,089
I don't know.

636
00:44:17,159 --> 00:44:19,150
It's certainly possible.

637
00:44:20,596 --> 00:44:25,863
God knows my seed
is as strong as an Alaskan salmon.

638
00:44:27,503 --> 00:44:30,529
And I partied pretty hard
in the early '80s.

639
00:44:32,007 --> 00:44:33,941
In Sandusky?

640
00:44:35,444 --> 00:44:39,039
Apart from Akron, I probably spent
more time in Sandusky...

641
00:44:39,114 --> 00:44:41,207
than any place on earth.

642
00:44:43,886 --> 00:44:45,820
Damn it!

643
00:44:48,824 --> 00:44:51,952
Everything was going so great.
Now it's ruined.

644
00:44:56,131 --> 00:44:58,497
Booger.

645
00:45:01,704 --> 00:45:03,638
Your wedding isn't ruined.

646
00:45:05,374 --> 00:45:07,308
What are you talking about?

647
00:45:07,376 --> 00:45:11,904
We just had a food fight.

648
00:45:13,182 --> 00:45:16,743
People don't have...

649
00:45:18,220 --> 00:45:22,156
food fights at their...

650
00:45:22,224 --> 00:45:24,158
bridal showers!

651
00:45:24,226 --> 00:45:26,217
But I did.

652
00:45:27,596 --> 00:45:30,156
Some nouveau-riche guy...

653
00:45:30,232 --> 00:45:32,996
Iooked like he could
have been a banker...

654
00:45:33,068 --> 00:45:36,037
his mashing...

655
00:45:36,105 --> 00:45:41,168
handfuls of <i>garni</i> up my nostrils!

656
00:45:43,078 --> 00:45:45,012
I know things look bleak.

657
00:45:46,482 --> 00:45:48,347
But they've been bleak before.

658
00:45:48,481 --> 00:45:51,450
Do you remember at Adams College?

659
00:45:51,517 --> 00:45:53,610
We were exiled from the dorms...

660
00:45:53,686 --> 00:45:56,280
and forced to live in the gymnasium.

661
00:45:56,355 --> 00:45:58,585
Do you remember
in Fort Lauderdale...

662
00:45:58,658 --> 00:46:02,219
when we were persecuted
into subjugation and incarcerated?

663
00:46:02,295 --> 00:46:06,425
How about when Orrin Price
framed me...

664
00:46:06,499 --> 00:46:08,592
for embezzling...

665
00:46:08,668 --> 00:46:12,832
Adams College
computer research funds?

666
00:46:12,905 --> 00:46:17,274
We may have been subjected
to the yoke of nerd oppression before...

667
00:46:17,343 --> 00:46:21,575
but we're not gonna be subjected to it again!

668
00:46:21,647 --> 00:46:25,640
This wedding is not over!
The son of a gun has just begun!

669
00:46:28,087 --> 00:46:30,954
Come on, pal.

670
00:46:42,001 --> 00:46:45,459
Meet me at the Wood Bridge
in half an hour.

671
00:46:48,374 --> 00:46:50,365
Please?

672
00:46:53,012 --> 00:46:55,003
Hello?

673
00:46:56,649 --> 00:47:01,018
I'm sorry.
Is this 555-4264?

674
00:47:02,355 --> 00:47:05,950
Knock, knock.
Is this a private party?

675
00:47:07,126 --> 00:47:09,060
Have a drink, Chip.

676
00:47:09,128 --> 00:47:11,790
Thanks, Dad-Aaron.

677
00:47:14,133 --> 00:47:18,092
I'm taking a lot of flack
from this from my wife.

678
00:47:18,171 --> 00:47:21,038
I thought the food fight
was a nice plus though.

679
00:47:21,107 --> 00:47:25,976
This is a career day for you, Chip.
As a matter of fact...

680
00:47:26,045 --> 00:47:29,503
this is the first good thing
I could ever remember you doing.

681
00:47:29,582 --> 00:47:31,982
Come on.
I've done lots of good things.

682
00:47:32,051 --> 00:47:33,985
Name one.

683
00:47:34,053 --> 00:47:37,648
- Are you serious?
- Name one.

684
00:47:39,358 --> 00:47:41,826
Well, there was, uh-

685
00:47:41,894 --> 00:47:43,828
Uh-

686
00:47:43,896 --> 00:47:47,559
You don't do anything
and I pay you a fortune. But look.

687
00:47:47,633 --> 00:47:50,158
You made up for everything.
You're the man...

688
00:47:50,236 --> 00:47:53,672
who drove the Booger man
out of my daughter's life.

689
00:47:58,444 --> 00:48:00,571
Daddy, I have to talk to you.

690
00:48:00,646 --> 00:48:02,546
<i>I'm so confused.</i>

691
00:48:04,483 --> 00:48:07,680
First of all, I just wanna thank you
for being so concerned about me.

692
00:48:07,753 --> 00:48:10,017
<i>I know in my heart...</i>

693
00:48:10,089 --> 00:48:12,990
you only want what's best for me...

694
00:48:13,059 --> 00:48:15,550
no matter what you say
or do or how you behave.

695
00:48:17,863 --> 00:48:21,822
I sure do love that Booger though.

696
00:48:21,901 --> 00:48:25,098
I can't believe he's got
a kid he never told me about.

697
00:48:32,979 --> 00:48:35,607
Kids-you gotta love 'em.

698
00:48:40,186 --> 00:48:44,122
It, um- It is true, Chip?

699
00:48:44,190 --> 00:48:46,385
Is what true?

700
00:48:48,060 --> 00:48:51,928
That, um, he has a child...

701
00:48:51,998 --> 00:48:54,057
with an unwed mother and all that?

702
00:48:54,133 --> 00:48:57,625
Yeah, sure it's true.
The detective I hired found it.

703
00:48:57,703 --> 00:49:02,402
Because it, uh- it wouldn't
be good if it wasn't true.

704
00:49:02,475 --> 00:49:07,503
- It's true.
- Then, uh-Then it's good.

705
00:49:07,580 --> 00:49:11,846
- 'Cause it's true.
- Right. If it's true, it's good.

706
00:49:11,917 --> 00:49:14,750
And, uh, I feel good about that.

707
00:49:14,820 --> 00:49:16,651
Good.

708
00:49:38,244 --> 00:49:40,735
- Booger!
- Jeanie!

709
00:49:43,749 --> 00:49:46,718
Let's go to our secret spot
so no one will see us.

710
00:49:48,654 --> 00:49:52,647
- I love you, Booger.
- Oh, I love you too.

711
00:49:52,725 --> 00:49:56,957
But marriage is about trust.
No secrets from each other, remember?

712
00:49:57,029 --> 00:49:59,054
I don't have any secrets.

713
00:50:00,266 --> 00:50:02,700
Well, what about that child
in Sandusky, Ohio?

714
00:50:02,768 --> 00:50:06,636
I don't have a child
in Sandusky, Ohio!

715
00:50:07,973 --> 00:50:10,806
Why would Detective Penrod
say that you did?

716
00:50:10,876 --> 00:50:12,810
Well, I don't know!

717
00:50:12,878 --> 00:50:15,608
I don't even know
who Detective Penrod is!

718
00:50:15,681 --> 00:50:19,981
<i>I'm a condemned man</i>
<i>and I don't have a child!</i>

719
00:50:22,388 --> 00:50:25,152
I believe you, Booger.

720
00:50:26,826 --> 00:50:28,760
You do?

721
00:50:28,828 --> 00:50:31,820
Yes, because marriage
is about trust.

722
00:50:31,897 --> 00:50:37,199
<i>And I trust you... completely.</i>

723
00:50:39,271 --> 00:50:43,037
All I know is that I love you and I think
we should continue the wedding.

724
00:50:43,109 --> 00:50:45,942
Oh, Booger, I-
I don't know what to do.

725
00:50:46,011 --> 00:50:50,914
L- I don't know. I don't know
what's right or wrong anymore.

726
00:50:52,351 --> 00:50:54,945
I, uh-

727
00:50:55,020 --> 00:50:57,079
I know it's a day early, but...

728
00:51:00,025 --> 00:51:03,392
I'd like you to read my valentine.

729
00:51:11,804 --> 00:51:13,795
Open it up.

730
00:51:14,807 --> 00:51:16,866
A cow.

731
00:51:20,579 --> 00:51:23,639
"An empty spot was on my heart...

732
00:51:23,716 --> 00:51:26,913
"until I met you, O Valentine.

733
00:51:26,986 --> 00:51:30,444
"Then the spot filled in.
My heart was whole.

734
00:51:30,523 --> 00:51:35,017
"I could love
for the first time in my life...

735
00:51:35,094 --> 00:51:39,121
"now that you are going to become...

736
00:51:42,168 --> 00:51:44,159
my wife."

737
00:51:48,040 --> 00:51:53,137
- The hell with my dad!
- That's exactly what I'd hoped you'd say.

738
00:51:55,981 --> 00:51:58,609
Again.

739
00:52:04,156 --> 00:52:08,320
I can't tell you
what it does to hear you moo again.

740
00:52:14,867 --> 00:52:17,597
- Oh, Booger!
- Jeanie!

741
00:52:30,082 --> 00:52:32,744
- It's on!
- What's on?

742
00:52:32,818 --> 00:52:35,309
The wedding is on again!

743
00:52:35,387 --> 00:52:39,255
First it's on, then it's off.
Now it's on again.

744
00:52:39,325 --> 00:52:41,555
I am on an emotional roller coaster.

745
00:52:41,627 --> 00:52:44,619
I am not a yo-yo.

746
00:52:51,036 --> 00:52:54,631
How can the wedding be on? We all can't
even be in the same room together.

747
00:52:54,707 --> 00:52:56,732
Never in the history of weddings...

748
00:52:56,809 --> 00:52:59,710
has there ever been a clearer case
of incompatibility.

749
00:52:59,778 --> 00:53:04,477
<i>Aaron, Jeanie is thrilled.</i>
<i>Think about her for once.</i>

750
00:53:04,550 --> 00:53:07,781
I am thinking about her.
The man is a liar and a child deserter.

751
00:53:07,853 --> 00:53:11,448
If she goes through with this wedding,
I'm not gonna have anything to do with it!

752
00:53:11,524 --> 00:53:14,789
Zero, nothing, nada, zip!

753
00:53:14,860 --> 00:53:17,693
<i>Ow!</i>

754
00:53:17,763 --> 00:53:21,164
Okay, anybody who feels
that Booger could have...

755
00:53:21,233 --> 00:53:24,396
an illegitimate child in Sandusky, Ohio,
raise your right hands.

756
00:53:29,108 --> 00:53:31,235
Opposed?

757
00:53:31,310 --> 00:53:33,710
- You don't think it's possible?
- No, I do not.

758
00:53:33,779 --> 00:53:36,077
Booger may be Booger,
but he always took precautions.

759
00:53:36,148 --> 00:53:40,585
- That is right. He always did wear condoms.
- Oh. Condom.

760
00:53:40,653 --> 00:53:43,349
- So he couldn't have a child.
- No way.

761
00:53:46,859 --> 00:53:51,228
- Harold, where you going?
- <i>I don't know, but I would guess Aunt Lois's.</i>

762
00:53:51,297 --> 00:53:53,458
Are you scoring, Harold?

763
00:53:53,532 --> 00:53:56,865
I certainly wouldn't
tell you if I was.

764
00:53:56,936 --> 00:54:00,372
But I guarantee you I ain't going
over there for breakfast.

765
00:54:10,749 --> 00:54:13,377
- It's on!
- What's on?

766
00:54:13,452 --> 00:54:15,420
The wedding!

767
00:54:24,697 --> 00:54:27,063
I thought you told me
the love child was real.

768
00:54:27,132 --> 00:54:29,930
I didn't say she was real.
I said it was a great idea.

769
00:54:30,002 --> 00:54:35,099
But it hasn't turned out
to be such a great idea, has it?

770
00:54:35,174 --> 00:54:39,304
If Aaron finds out I've lied to him,
I'm dead. He's gonna fire me.

771
00:54:39,378 --> 00:54:43,109
Hey, if he fires you, isn't he also
cutting off his own daughter?

772
00:54:43,182 --> 00:54:47,118
He's gonna give her an allowance
that I'm not allowed to touch.

773
00:54:47,186 --> 00:54:50,280
Well, that'd do it.

774
00:54:50,356 --> 00:54:54,315
Relax. There are plenty of ways
to ruin a wedding.

775
00:54:54,393 --> 00:54:56,953
- Such as?
- <i>It's easy.</i>

776
00:54:57,029 --> 00:54:59,122
You know what
bachelor parties are like.

777
00:54:59,198 --> 00:55:02,326
Beautiful women, liquor flowing,
raw naked temptation.

778
00:55:02,401 --> 00:55:04,631
<i>Booger's bound to succumb.</i>

779
00:55:04,703 --> 00:55:08,264
According to his bio, he's got
the self-control of a brahma bull.

780
00:55:08,340 --> 00:55:10,604
How would we-
How would we show proof of this?

781
00:55:10,676 --> 00:55:13,270
We'll make one of America's...

782
00:55:13,345 --> 00:55:16,041
least funny home videos.

783
00:55:20,819 --> 00:55:22,810
Do it.

784
00:55:24,523 --> 00:55:28,118
Hey. There's a horse here
named Big Booger.

785
00:55:39,004 --> 00:55:42,030
I missed the food fight.

786
00:55:42,107 --> 00:55:45,304
And now I'm gonna miss
Booger's surprise theme bachelor party.

787
00:55:45,377 --> 00:55:47,868
Well, not really, Stan.

788
00:55:47,946 --> 00:55:51,347
May I present to you and Judy
a special Valentine's Day treat.

789
00:55:51,417 --> 00:55:55,717
Try these on for size. Now, tonight
when the bachelor party starts...

790
00:55:55,788 --> 00:55:59,986
you simply turn on the TV,
hit the function button on your remote.

791
00:56:00,059 --> 00:56:03,586
<i>You might not be there,</i>
<i>but you'll have the next best thing-</i>

792
00:56:03,662 --> 00:56:07,257
Skolnick Vision.

793
00:56:07,332 --> 00:56:09,266
- Bye, guys.
- Thanks, Lewis.

794
00:56:09,334 --> 00:56:11,996
Thanks.

795
00:56:19,078 --> 00:56:22,309
- Oh, I made it!
- Great shot, Takashi.
You owe me another 20 bucks.

796
00:56:22,381 --> 00:56:25,214
- Huh?
- Sometimes when you win, you lose.
Let's play for your watch.

797
00:56:25,284 --> 00:56:27,445
- Okay, thank you.
- You're welcome.

798
00:56:27,519 --> 00:56:31,319
Red ball, middle pocket and
you can call me London Fats.

799
00:56:35,094 --> 00:56:38,120
Here you go.
A bumper pool tournament!

800
00:56:38,197 --> 00:56:40,859
What an original idea
for a bachelor party!

801
00:56:40,933 --> 00:56:43,265
I knew that you
would love it, Booger.

802
00:56:43,335 --> 00:56:46,270
Is there gonna be a girlie show?

803
00:56:46,338 --> 00:56:48,465
Mr. Dawson, that would be sexist.

804
00:56:48,540 --> 00:56:51,805
We believe it's possible to be entertained
without demeaning women.

805
00:56:51,877 --> 00:56:55,938
That's nice. But personally,
I'd prefer a little skin.

806
00:56:57,416 --> 00:57:01,250
Hey, fellas, I got winners.

807
00:57:02,921 --> 00:57:05,947
He's got a lot of nerve
showing his face around here.

808
00:57:06,024 --> 00:57:08,686
- Temper, temper.
- Don't worry about it, Booger.

809
00:57:08,761 --> 00:57:11,628
We got him under
24-hour surveillance.

810
00:57:11,697 --> 00:57:14,598
There's nothing he can do
that we don't know about.

811
00:57:17,035 --> 00:57:18,969
Hey, no lofting, Harold!

812
00:57:19,037 --> 00:57:22,734
Nouveau riche! Nouveau riche!
Nouveau riche!

813
00:57:22,808 --> 00:57:25,299
<i>Nouveau riche! Nouveau riche!</i>

814
00:57:25,377 --> 00:57:29,245
I really expected Aaron
to be here tonight.

815
00:57:29,314 --> 00:57:31,509
He doesn't want anything
to do with the wedding.

816
00:57:31,583 --> 00:57:34,780
He might have extended me
the courtesy of allowing me to know that.

817
00:57:34,853 --> 00:57:36,787
<i>Nouveau riche!</i>
<i>Nouveau riche!</i>

818
00:57:36,855 --> 00:57:40,256
All right, all right, all right.
All right!

819
00:57:40,325 --> 00:57:42,190
Nouveau-

820
00:57:42,261 --> 00:57:45,059
I know we had
a little trouble today...

821
00:57:45,130 --> 00:57:48,258
at the all-you-can-eat nerd bridal shower
at the Rump Roast Room...

822
00:57:48,333 --> 00:57:50,528
but, hey,
that's behind us now, right?

823
00:57:50,602 --> 00:57:52,968
- We're adults.
- Hold it, everybody.

824
00:57:53,038 --> 00:57:55,939
<i>Lewis is right.</i>

825
00:57:56,008 --> 00:57:59,136
<i>Even I've been a bit of a recalcitrant</i>
<i>during this wedding...</i>

826
00:57:59,211 --> 00:58:02,840
but now that I've gotten
to know... Booger...

827
00:58:02,915 --> 00:58:06,544
<i>I realize that you and Jeanie</i>
<i>are a perfect couple.</i>

828
00:58:06,618 --> 00:58:10,782
<i>And I know that</i>
<i>it's only the first step...</i>

829
00:58:10,856 --> 00:58:15,520
But I'm hoping that you will accept...

830
00:58:15,594 --> 00:58:17,528
my dove of peace.

831
00:58:23,602 --> 00:58:26,366
<i>Miss Modem!</i>

832
00:58:28,273 --> 00:58:32,369
- Miss Numbers.
- Come on!

833
00:58:34,413 --> 00:58:36,904
Miss Mainframe.

834
00:58:36,982 --> 00:58:41,214
- Leave it to Chip to be sexist.
- Me, me, me!

835
00:58:41,286 --> 00:58:43,481
<i>Miss Communication.</i>

836
00:58:45,257 --> 00:58:47,657
You know, they are sort of enjoyable.

837
00:58:47,726 --> 00:58:50,490
Miss Floppy Disk.

838
00:58:59,605 --> 00:59:02,039
- I love you!
- Come on!

839
00:59:13,018 --> 00:59:15,851
Hey, hey, hey.

840
00:59:15,921 --> 00:59:18,515
- I'll take care of him.
- Go get him.

841
00:59:18,590 --> 00:59:22,526
Hi, Booger. I'm your present.

842
00:59:31,103 --> 00:59:33,867
You feel so good!

843
00:59:40,545 --> 00:59:43,309
I can't take no more!

844
00:59:51,957 --> 00:59:54,824
<i>Take it off!</i>

845
01:00:26,980 --> 01:00:29,141
This Skolnick Vision is great...

846
01:00:29,216 --> 01:00:33,676
but still, it's not like
actually being there.

847
01:00:36,690 --> 01:00:39,818
We could have
our own stag party, Stan.

848
01:01:32,312 --> 01:01:35,713
We're gonna have some fun.
A cool time.

849
01:01:40,120 --> 01:01:42,054
What is all this?

850
01:01:42,122 --> 01:01:45,353
This is anything
that you want it to be, Booger.

851
01:01:53,600 --> 01:01:56,933
Hey! Hey!

852
01:01:57,004 --> 01:01:59,734
<i>Hey!</i>

853
01:01:59,806 --> 01:02:02,036
Hey! Hey!

854
01:02:02,109 --> 01:02:03,906
<i>Hey!</i>

855
01:02:03,977 --> 01:02:07,640
Hey! Hey!

856
01:02:11,285 --> 01:02:13,753
Did you do the nasty?

857
01:02:16,957 --> 01:02:19,289
I still got it.

858
01:02:23,797 --> 01:02:26,425
All right, Booger!

859
01:02:26,500 --> 01:02:30,527
Hey! Hey! Hey!

860
01:02:32,239 --> 01:02:36,232
<i>This better be good to have woken us up</i>
<i>in the middle of the night.</i>

861
01:02:36,310 --> 01:02:40,576
I want you all to see what kind
of lowlifeJeanie's going to marry.

862
01:02:40,647 --> 01:02:43,309
- <i>What is all this?</i>
- Booger?

863
01:02:43,383 --> 01:02:47,479
This is anything
you want it to be, Booger.

864
01:02:47,554 --> 01:02:50,580
It's your last night
as a single man.

865
01:02:50,657 --> 01:02:53,148
You're allowed to have
a little fun, Booger.

866
01:02:53,226 --> 01:02:56,423
Oh, my God.

867
01:02:57,731 --> 01:03:01,827
- I can't do this.
- Everybody's nervous at first.

868
01:03:01,902 --> 01:03:06,396
<i>No, no, no.</i>
<i>It's not that I'm nervous.</i>

869
01:03:06,473 --> 01:03:10,307
I am not nervous.

870
01:03:10,377 --> 01:03:13,107
It's just that, um...

871
01:03:13,180 --> 01:03:17,480
Jeanie and I have a special bond...

872
01:03:17,551 --> 01:03:20,987
<i>and I don't want to break it.</i>

873
01:03:22,956 --> 01:03:25,356
Plus, you make me very nervous.

874
01:03:27,427 --> 01:03:31,158
So, if it's all right with you,
perhaps we could just...

875
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:36,069
sit here for a moment...

876
01:03:36,136 --> 01:03:38,730
so the guys outside won't...

877
01:03:38,805 --> 01:03:41,330
think that I'm the sissy
that you know me to be.

878
01:03:43,343 --> 01:03:47,302
<i>You're not a sissy, Booger.</i>
<i>You're a mensch.</i>

879
01:03:47,381 --> 01:03:51,147
- I think he acted very responsibly.
- That's right, Chip.

880
01:03:52,753 --> 01:03:55,813
Oh, yes, Mommy!

881
01:03:55,889 --> 01:03:59,484
Oh, I'm feeling better.

882
01:03:59,559 --> 01:04:04,053
- Ooh.
- <i>I've been very bad!</i>

883
01:04:04,131 --> 01:04:06,156
I want a divorce, Chip.

884
01:04:06,233 --> 01:04:09,862
It must be a mistake.
That's not me.

885
01:04:11,571 --> 01:04:14,540
Those nerds did it. I bet they did it
on a computer or something.

886
01:04:14,608 --> 01:04:16,599
The things they can do
with computers these days.

887
01:04:16,676 --> 01:04:21,670
No, I'm the one who made the mistake,
Chip, when I married you.

888
01:04:23,483 --> 01:04:25,713
It was a little indiscretion
at a bachelor party.

889
01:04:25,786 --> 01:04:28,380
It's not just the video, Chip!

890
01:04:28,455 --> 01:04:31,583
It's been all downhill
since the honeymoon.

891
01:04:31,658 --> 01:04:35,025
You drink too much.
You're mentally abusive to me.

892
01:04:35,095 --> 01:04:37,825
You fool around with other women.

893
01:04:37,898 --> 01:04:40,731
We have absolutely
nothing in common.

894
01:04:40,801 --> 01:04:43,361
Maybe I could work a little harder.

895
01:04:43,437 --> 01:04:47,999
It makes me ill to think
I've stayed with you as long as I have.

896
01:04:52,212 --> 01:04:54,407
Honey?

897
01:04:58,618 --> 01:05:00,916
You mind if I spoke to Chip alone?

898
01:05:00,987 --> 01:05:02,955
Oh, no, certainly.
Come, sweetie.

899
01:05:03,023 --> 01:05:05,048
Gaylord!

900
01:05:10,163 --> 01:05:13,098
- This isn't good, Chip.
- No.

901
01:05:13,166 --> 01:05:16,067
So I'm gonna kill you, Chip.

902
01:05:16,136 --> 01:05:19,230
You made a fool out of my daughter!

903
01:05:19,306 --> 01:05:21,240
I can explain everything.

904
01:05:21,308 --> 01:05:23,242
You lied about
the illegitimate child...

905
01:05:23,310 --> 01:05:26,006
then you tried to frame
Booger and you got caught!

906
01:05:26,079 --> 01:05:29,071
The illegitimate child will
be here tomorrow morning at 10:00 a.m.

907
01:05:29,149 --> 01:05:31,310
She's on route right now
from Sandusky, Ohio.

908
01:05:31,384 --> 01:05:34,285
There is no illegitimate child!
You made it all up.

909
01:05:34,354 --> 01:05:37,414
The illegitimate child will be here
at 10:00 in the morning!

910
01:05:37,491 --> 01:05:41,587
It better be! And you better get
my daughter to forgive you...

911
01:05:41,661 --> 01:05:44,221
or there's no room for you
in this family...

912
01:05:44,297 --> 01:05:48,631
or at Humphrey Industries,
you pervert creep.

913
01:05:55,509 --> 01:05:58,910
Oh, boy. That was one heck
of a stag party last night, Lewis.

914
01:05:58,979 --> 01:06:00,913
I know I'll never forget it.

915
01:06:00,981 --> 01:06:04,940
I especially enjoyed your dance with the woman
who removed her clothes, Mr. Booger.

916
01:06:05,018 --> 01:06:09,512
Trevor, remember there's a code of silence
about what goes on at a stag party.

917
01:06:09,589 --> 01:06:12,080
- Code of silence?
- So, reveal nothing...

918
01:06:12,158 --> 01:06:15,059
even if you're under hours
of interrogation and torture.

919
01:06:15,128 --> 01:06:17,824
<i>Wild horses couldn't</i>
<i>drag it out of me.</i>

920
01:06:17,898 --> 01:06:21,356
Who aren't I supposed to tell?

921
01:06:36,616 --> 01:06:38,641
- Lewis.
- Huh?

922
01:06:38,718 --> 01:06:40,982
There were women there,
weren't there?

923
01:06:44,391 --> 01:06:46,382
Yes.

924
01:06:48,628 --> 01:06:50,687
Were they pretty?

925
01:06:52,232 --> 01:06:54,166
Yes.

926
01:06:54,234 --> 01:06:56,327
What'd you do with them?

927
01:06:58,872 --> 01:07:01,568
- The bunny hop.
- That's all you did?

928
01:07:01,641 --> 01:07:05,168
- Yes.
- Was the bunny hop?

929
01:07:07,981 --> 01:07:10,916
Okay. You can still
be my valentine then.

930
01:07:14,754 --> 01:07:17,882
Oh, Betty.
You shouldn't have.

931
01:07:17,958 --> 01:07:20,426
- He's so cute.
- He plays something too.

932
01:07:20,493 --> 01:07:23,087
Beautiful.

933
01:07:23,163 --> 01:07:27,259
Hey, guys!
It's Valentine's Day!

934
01:07:27,334 --> 01:07:29,564
Happy Valentine's Day!

935
01:07:29,636 --> 01:07:31,570
Happy Valentine's.

936
01:07:32,872 --> 01:07:36,035
Aaron, I hope you didn't have...

937
01:07:36,109 --> 01:07:39,567
anything to do with videotaping
Booger at the stag party.

938
01:07:39,646 --> 01:07:42,114
Absolutely not.
I wasn't even there.

939
01:07:42,182 --> 01:07:44,150
Mm-hmm.

940
01:07:44,217 --> 01:07:47,880
Aaron, if you don't
participate in this wedding...

941
01:07:47,954 --> 01:07:52,891
and make your daughter proud of you,
I'm going to leave you.

942
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:55,257
You would leave me?

943
01:07:55,328 --> 01:07:58,957
I have learned a lot from the nerds.
Nerds speak their mind.

944
01:07:59,032 --> 01:08:01,728
And from now on,
I'm gonna speak my mind too.

945
01:08:01,801 --> 01:08:05,737
<i>If you don't support your daughter</i>
<i>during this wedding, I'm outta here.</i>

946
01:08:05,805 --> 01:08:08,899
Fix your ascot.

947
01:08:08,975 --> 01:08:11,910
It's not like
I'm giving up that much.

948
01:08:11,978 --> 01:08:13,946
What is that supposed to mean?

949
01:08:14,014 --> 01:08:16,346
Aaron...

950
01:08:16,416 --> 01:08:19,579
we haven't had sex
since the Bush administration.

951
01:08:19,653 --> 01:08:23,783
Well, it's hard to perform in that way
when the Democrats are in power.

952
01:08:23,857 --> 01:08:25,950
Ask any guy in this neighborhood.

953
01:08:26,026 --> 01:08:28,620
That's why the sex hasn't been
that hot lately.

954
01:08:28,695 --> 01:08:31,960
Hot?
I'd settle for lukewarm.

955
01:08:32,032 --> 01:08:33,966
Zip your fly.

956
01:08:37,437 --> 01:08:42,067
It's not all my fault. How can I have sex
when I have to spend all my time...

957
01:08:42,142 --> 01:08:45,441
fixing my ascot, zippering my fly
and matching my socks?

958
01:08:45,512 --> 01:08:48,606
<i>I can't be perfect</i>
<i>for you anymore, Tippy.</i>

959
01:08:48,682 --> 01:08:50,809
It's too much pressure.

960
01:08:50,884 --> 01:08:54,752
Aaron. I thought I was helping you.

961
01:08:54,821 --> 01:08:57,483
I know how much you wanna
be accepted by the blue bloods...

962
01:08:57,557 --> 01:09:01,118
<i>but you don't ever have</i>
<i>to be perfect for me.</i>

963
01:09:01,194 --> 01:09:05,358
- I don't?
- No.

964
01:09:05,432 --> 01:09:09,698
I just want you to be the imperfect animal
I fell in love with.

965
01:09:09,769 --> 01:09:12,033
You mean it?

966
01:09:12,105 --> 01:09:14,869
Absolutely.

967
01:09:14,941 --> 01:09:17,034
Tippy.

968
01:09:17,110 --> 01:09:18,975
Aaron.

969
01:09:19,045 --> 01:09:21,843
Oh, Tippy.

970
01:09:21,915 --> 01:09:23,644
Aaron!

971
01:09:23,717 --> 01:09:26,686
Oh! Oh! Oh!

972
01:10:20,006 --> 01:10:22,304
I don't know if you're
enjoying your wedding...

973
01:10:22,375 --> 01:10:25,640
but it's been
the best time of my life.

974
01:10:25,712 --> 01:10:28,044
Nerds. Who knew?

975
01:10:28,114 --> 01:10:31,242
- Where are you?
- I'm over at Lois's.

976
01:10:31,317 --> 01:10:34,115
Well, it's been special.

977
01:10:34,187 --> 01:10:37,247
And thank God it's all going
to end this afternoon.

978
01:10:37,323 --> 01:10:40,884
It's all gonna end right now.

979
01:10:40,960 --> 01:10:44,225
I'd like you to meet
Heidi Dawson, your daughter.

980
01:10:58,611 --> 01:11:00,772
- <i>Oh, Aaron!</i>
- It's off!

981
01:11:02,816 --> 01:11:04,750
- What's off?
- <i>The wedding!</i>

982
01:11:04,818 --> 01:11:08,777
Booger's kid turned up.
I told you there was a kid.

983
01:11:14,194 --> 01:11:17,357
Guys, the wedding is off.

984
01:11:22,669 --> 01:11:24,830
It's not your fault.

985
01:11:24,904 --> 01:11:29,705
You didn't do anything.
You didn't ask to be born.

986
01:11:29,776 --> 01:11:33,075
Would you like me to give you a push
on those swings?

987
01:11:33,146 --> 01:11:37,344
- No, thanks.
- I'm a pretty good swing pusher.

988
01:11:37,417 --> 01:11:39,351
I could give you an over the top.

989
01:11:39,419 --> 01:11:42,286
I'm too old to be pushed
on the swings.

990
01:11:42,355 --> 01:11:47,418
Oh, right. Yeah,
you're too old for that.

991
01:11:47,493 --> 01:11:50,087
I used to hate it when people
treated me like a baby.

992
01:11:50,163 --> 01:11:52,996
- You did?
- Oh, yeah.

993
01:11:53,066 --> 01:11:55,660
So what do you like to do?

994
01:11:55,735 --> 01:11:57,726
I'm afraid to tell you because...

995
01:11:57,804 --> 01:12:01,433
if you don't like what I like,
then you won't like me.

996
01:12:04,978 --> 01:12:08,778
I think I'm going to like you...

997
01:12:08,848 --> 01:12:10,816
no matter what you do...

998
01:12:10,884 --> 01:12:14,320
as long as you live.

999
01:12:14,387 --> 01:12:16,150
So there.

1000
01:12:36,976 --> 01:12:40,776
- Booger.
- I'm here to seeJeanie.

1001
01:12:40,847 --> 01:12:44,214
I'm sorry, Booger, but Jeanie doesn't
wanna speak with you.

1002
01:12:44,284 --> 01:12:46,684
I would like her to tell me that.

1003
01:12:46,753 --> 01:12:51,190
Well, if she doesn't wanna talk with you,
she can't tell you then, can she?

1004
01:12:51,257 --> 01:12:54,954
Mrs. Humphrey, I am trying to be civil,
but now I am not asking.

1005
01:12:55,028 --> 01:12:57,360
I am demanding to see your daughter.

1006
01:12:57,430 --> 01:12:59,898
Oh, Booger.

1007
01:12:59,966 --> 01:13:01,900
I'm sorry.

1008
01:13:16,783 --> 01:13:19,081
Oh, honey, help him.

1009
01:13:19,152 --> 01:13:22,815
Booger, every wedding
has its crisis. This is yours.

1010
01:13:25,024 --> 01:13:28,790
A crisis would be easy
compared to this.

1011
01:13:36,002 --> 01:13:37,970
Jeanie!

1012
01:13:38,037 --> 01:13:40,130
Oh, Booger.

1013
01:13:43,977 --> 01:13:48,311
Booger, the groom never
stops pursuing his bride.

1014
01:13:50,450 --> 01:13:52,714
Never.

1015
01:14:02,061 --> 01:14:04,894
Hey, pal. Hey!
What are you doing?

1016
01:14:04,964 --> 01:14:07,626
Hey, wait a minute! Hey, wait!

1017
01:14:28,588 --> 01:14:30,579
Oh.

1018
01:14:42,368 --> 01:14:44,928
- Booger!
- Darling!

1019
01:14:45,004 --> 01:14:46,995
Whoa!

1020
01:14:49,876 --> 01:14:52,003
So what if I have a child.

1021
01:14:52,078 --> 01:14:55,479
I'm so confused.
I don't know what to think anymore.

1022
01:14:55,548 --> 01:14:57,641
Marry me, Jeanie.

1023
01:14:57,717 --> 01:15:00,015
I just need a few days
to think about it.

1024
01:15:00,086 --> 01:15:02,975
And not get married
on Valentine's Day?

1025
01:15:03,109 --> 01:15:06,010
I'm confused, Booger.
I need time!

1026
01:15:06,079 --> 01:15:09,412
There was a time when getting married
on Valentine's Day...

1027
01:15:09,482 --> 01:15:12,849
was the most important thing
in the world to us.

1028
01:15:15,922 --> 01:15:17,890
Please go, Booger.

1029
01:15:17,957 --> 01:15:20,118
Is that what you really want?

1030
01:15:21,561 --> 01:15:26,396
No, not in my heart
and not in my soul...

1031
01:15:26,466 --> 01:15:29,367
but I'm just so nuts
over this, you know.

1032
01:15:29,435 --> 01:15:32,996
It's like
I just need a little space.

1033
01:15:33,072 --> 01:15:35,700
Please, Booger?

1034
01:16:38,504 --> 01:16:40,438
It's on!

1035
01:16:40,506 --> 01:16:42,872
What's on?

1036
01:16:42,942 --> 01:16:45,103
The wedding!

1037
01:16:49,515 --> 01:16:51,506
Whoo-hoo!

1038
01:16:54,187 --> 01:16:57,623
I'm so glad the wedding is still on.

1039
01:16:57,690 --> 01:17:00,284
I was so wrong about nerds.

1040
01:17:00,359 --> 01:17:02,623
We nerds believe in forgiveness.

1041
01:17:04,597 --> 01:17:09,296
It's unreal how much
you remind me of my friend, Bing.

1042
01:17:11,604 --> 01:17:14,971
I've never met anyone
quite like you, Lamar.

1043
01:17:16,909 --> 01:17:18,843
I'll take that as a compliment.

1044
01:17:18,911 --> 01:17:21,471
It is.

1045
01:17:34,660 --> 01:17:36,890
- Lewis.
- Booger.

1046
01:17:41,267 --> 01:17:43,758
I'm gonna marry Cathleen Turtletaub.

1047
01:17:45,338 --> 01:17:48,171
Who's Cathleen Turtletaub?

1048
01:17:48,241 --> 01:17:50,232
Heidi's mother.

1049
01:17:50,309 --> 01:17:53,801
But you don't even know
Cathleen Turtletaub.

1050
01:17:53,880 --> 01:17:57,043
I know, but it's
the right thing to do.

1051
01:18:13,266 --> 01:18:16,258
This really isn't about
Cathleen Turtletaub, is it?

1052
01:18:19,639 --> 01:18:21,607
No, it isn't.

1053
01:18:21,674 --> 01:18:26,111
This is about your <i>zapatos</i>
becoming <i>muy frÃ­o,</i> no?

1054
01:18:26,178 --> 01:18:29,272
- Lewis.
- Booger.

1055
01:18:29,348 --> 01:18:33,409
I didn't go through with it
with the stripper last night.

1056
01:18:33,486 --> 01:18:36,819
- Oh, yeah, we know.
- How do you know?

1057
01:18:36,889 --> 01:18:42,225
We kind of figured it out when we edited
the videotape to ruin Chip's life.

1058
01:18:42,295 --> 01:18:45,389
Here I was passing up...

1059
01:18:45,464 --> 01:18:48,797
this mound of perfect.

1060
01:18:48,868 --> 01:18:53,771
<i>I, who have never</i>
<i>passed up anything in my life.</i>

1061
01:18:53,839 --> 01:18:57,969
What is the matter with me, Lewis?

1062
01:18:58,044 --> 01:19:00,308
Where has the Booger I have known...

1063
01:19:00,379 --> 01:19:03,837
and loved... gone?

1064
01:19:13,025 --> 01:19:14,754
You ready?

1065
01:19:16,429 --> 01:19:18,659
Let's do it.

1066
01:19:22,601 --> 01:19:24,865
Please be my valentine.

1067
01:19:24,937 --> 01:19:29,340
You haven't given me a valentine in 10 years
and this is what you come up with?

1068
01:19:29,408 --> 01:19:31,399
Pathetic!

1069
01:19:45,191 --> 01:19:48,627
<i>Aaron, Tippy, the food fight</i>
<i>was a sensational idea!</i>

1070
01:19:48,694 --> 01:19:52,130
I'm gonna use the nerd theme
at my wedding.

1071
01:19:54,734 --> 01:19:56,793
Mylan.

1072
01:19:56,869 --> 01:20:00,965
I'm so sorry for all the trouble
that you've experienced with this affair.

1073
01:20:01,040 --> 01:20:02,974
Thanks for coming to the wedding.

1074
01:20:03,042 --> 01:20:06,842
I do not care to judge you on the basis
of the hell I've been through.

1075
01:20:06,912 --> 01:20:09,676
But I trust it was merely
a horrific aberration...

1076
01:20:09,749 --> 01:20:12,718
and I expect the wedding
to be quite different.

1077
01:20:16,288 --> 01:20:18,279
What?

1078
01:20:19,291 --> 01:20:21,759
Oh.

1079
01:20:21,827 --> 01:20:23,988
I trust that'll be enough.

1080
01:20:25,364 --> 01:20:28,800
Wouldn't have missed
this wedding for the world.

1081
01:20:28,868 --> 01:20:31,894
<i>Everybody, stand aside!</i>
<i>Make way for the groom!</i>

1082
01:20:33,973 --> 01:20:36,771
I would know that horn anywhere.

1083
01:20:42,114 --> 01:20:44,514
- <i>Dad!</i>
- U. N!

1084
01:20:44,583 --> 01:20:47,313
- Hey, how are you?
- Hey!

1085
01:20:47,386 --> 01:20:49,013
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1086
01:20:49,088 --> 01:20:51,989
I wouldn't miss
a nerd wedding for the world.

1087
01:20:52,058 --> 01:20:54,322
- How are you?
- Lewis, how are you?

1088
01:20:54,393 --> 01:20:57,521
- How's my unborn grandson?
- You mean your unborn fetal son?

1089
01:21:00,533 --> 01:21:02,467
<i>Emergency! Excuse, please.</i>

1090
01:21:02,535 --> 01:21:04,469
The bishop has a kidney stone.

1091
01:21:04,537 --> 01:21:06,630
<i>He no make it to wedding!</i>

1092
01:21:06,705 --> 01:21:10,197
How am I supposed to get married
without a clergyman?

1093
01:21:10,276 --> 01:21:13,143
- I can marry you.
- But I don't love you.

1094
01:21:13,212 --> 01:21:16,375
Oh. No, no. I took
a correspondence course.

1095
01:21:16,449 --> 01:21:18,883
<i>I'm a fully ordained</i>
<i>Tilhoonian minister.</i>

1096
01:21:18,951 --> 01:21:21,545
- You are?
- U.N.

1097
01:21:50,316 --> 01:21:52,807
Hi, Dad.

1098
01:21:52,885 --> 01:21:55,251
Shh.

1099
01:21:55,321 --> 01:21:57,255
Sorry.

1100
01:22:11,570 --> 01:22:15,233
I've never seen a nerd wedding
I didn't cry at.

1101
01:22:15,307 --> 01:22:18,003
This is just fabulous!

1102
01:22:18,077 --> 01:22:20,011
What a wienie.

1103
01:22:25,618 --> 01:22:27,848
Doesn't she look good?

1104
01:22:49,208 --> 01:22:52,200
Lewis?

1105
01:22:53,612 --> 01:22:56,809
- Betty, you're having the baby!
- Lewis!

1106
01:22:56,882 --> 01:23:00,045
- Oh. You're having the baby, honey.
- <i>Lewis.</i>

1107
01:23:00,119 --> 01:23:03,987
Booger, quick. You guys. Lamar!
Quick, come here!

1108
01:23:04,056 --> 01:23:06,581
<i>Lamar. You guys. Booger.</i>

1109
01:23:06,659 --> 01:23:08,820
- Lamar, quick, hurry!
- Don't panic!

1110
01:23:08,894 --> 01:23:11,920
<i>Ogre. Ogre.</i>
<i>We gotta carry her.</i>

1111
01:23:11,997 --> 01:23:13,897
Okay. Here we go.

1112
01:23:13,966 --> 01:23:16,594
- That's it. Careful.
- Okay, I got her.

1113
01:23:16,669 --> 01:23:20,105
- Okay, Lewey! Where, Lewey?
- Come on.

1114
01:23:20,172 --> 01:23:23,938
<i>Where, Lewey?</i>

1115
01:23:29,748 --> 01:23:32,911
Ogre, here. Put her head right here
in the chopped liver.

1116
01:23:32,985 --> 01:23:36,216
- Lewis!
- <i>She need an ice pack?</i>

1117
01:23:37,590 --> 01:23:40,957
Don't push. Don't push, Betty.

1118
01:23:41,026 --> 01:23:43,859
Betty, don't push. Betty, don't push.

1119
01:23:43,929 --> 01:23:46,762
- Lewis!
- Betty, don't push! Betty, don't push!

1120
01:23:46,832 --> 01:23:49,357
- Eee-hee-hoo.
- Eee-hee-hoo!

1121
01:23:49,435 --> 01:23:52,199
<i>Eee-hee-hoo! Eee-hee-hoo!</i>

1122
01:23:52,271 --> 01:23:55,263
Eee-hee-hoo! Eee-hee-hoo!

1123
01:23:55,341 --> 01:23:58,367
Eee-hee-hoo! Eee-hee-hoo!

1124
01:23:58,444 --> 01:24:01,038
Heidi, where are you going?

1125
01:24:01,113 --> 01:24:03,547
I shouldn't be here.

1126
01:24:03,616 --> 01:24:06,050
Of course you should be here.

1127
01:24:06,118 --> 01:24:10,817
I'm not really your daughter.
Chip got me from an orphanage.

1128
01:24:13,559 --> 01:24:17,655
Chip got you in an orphanage?

1129
01:24:21,233 --> 01:24:25,397
You, uh, rented an orphan?

1130
01:24:25,471 --> 01:24:29,430
It seemed like
a good idea at the time.

1131
01:24:29,508 --> 01:24:32,306
I've been under
a lot of stress lately.

1132
01:24:32,378 --> 01:24:34,744
I'm sorry.

1133
01:24:36,649 --> 01:24:39,083
Daddy, don't! Don't!

1134
01:24:42,154 --> 01:24:45,055
Betty, don't scream!

1135
01:24:45,124 --> 01:24:49,151
- Get off our land.
- <i>Betty, don't scream!</i>

1136
01:24:49,228 --> 01:24:52,254
Aren't you forgetting something?

1137
01:24:52,331 --> 01:24:54,356
The keys to the B.M.W.

1138
01:24:54,433 --> 01:24:56,526
<i>Cough 'em up.</i>

1139
01:24:56,602 --> 01:25:00,595
Wait, honey!

1140
01:25:03,509 --> 01:25:08,139
- <i>It's all your fault, Lewis!</i>
- You nerds did this to me.

1141
01:25:09,815 --> 01:25:11,976
But I'll get you...

1142
01:25:12,051 --> 01:25:15,578
if it's the last thing I do!

1143
01:25:18,524 --> 01:25:21,391
- Bye, Chip.
- Hmph!

1144
01:25:21,460 --> 01:25:23,394
<i>Bye, Chip.</i>

1145
01:25:23,462 --> 01:25:26,295
My next husband's
going to be a nerd.

1146
01:25:31,036 --> 01:25:34,802
I, uh- I would like to
make an announcement.

1147
01:25:34,873 --> 01:25:37,364
<i>I have, uh...</i>

1148
01:25:37,443 --> 01:25:40,378
been a jerk for this whole wedding.

1149
01:25:40,446 --> 01:25:43,472
You certainly have.

1150
01:25:43,549 --> 01:25:45,710
L-I never been around
a nerd before...

1151
01:25:45,784 --> 01:25:48,548
and I guess, uh-

1152
01:25:48,620 --> 01:25:51,248
well, I guess I judged
a book by its cover.

1153
01:25:51,323 --> 01:25:54,759
Booger.

1154
01:25:56,328 --> 01:25:58,922
I know you and Jeanie are gonna
be very happy together...

1155
01:25:58,997 --> 01:26:02,262
<i>because you know what you are</i>
<i>and you're proud of it.</i>

1156
01:26:05,537 --> 01:26:10,338
Well, I'm... sick of trying
to be something I'm not.

1157
01:26:10,409 --> 01:26:12,673
Come on!
Push, honey, push!

1158
01:26:12,745 --> 01:26:16,943
- Tippy.
- <i>Push, Betty, push!</i>

1159
01:26:17,015 --> 01:26:20,348
- L-
- <i>Push, Betty, push!</i>

1160
01:26:20,419 --> 01:26:22,410
L-

1161
01:26:24,723 --> 01:26:27,248
I am nouveau riche
and I'm proud of it!

1162
01:26:30,863 --> 01:26:36,165
Mylan, if who I am isn't good enough
for the Republican party of this state...

1163
01:26:36,235 --> 01:26:38,169
then to hell with the nomination!

1164
01:26:38,237 --> 01:26:41,297
- And that is the truth!
- <i>Push, Betty, push!</i>

1165
01:26:41,373 --> 01:26:44,308
The nerds have brought my man back.

1166
01:26:48,380 --> 01:26:50,644
Push, Betty, push! Push, Betty, push!

1167
01:26:50,716 --> 01:26:54,083
- <i>Push, Betty, push!</i>
- Wow.

1168
01:26:54,153 --> 01:26:57,611
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't go.

1169
01:27:02,728 --> 01:27:05,822
What would you say if I said...

1170
01:27:05,898 --> 01:27:08,890
we should adopt Heidi?

1171
01:27:10,803 --> 01:27:14,295
I would say I love you even more
than I already do...

1172
01:27:14,373 --> 01:27:17,240
and I didn't think
that was possible.

1173
01:27:19,711 --> 01:27:22,407
You gave up what you wanted
to tell the truth.

1174
01:27:22,481 --> 01:27:25,245
I really admire
that quality in a person.

1175
01:27:25,317 --> 01:27:28,753
<i>Push, Betty, push!</i>
<i>Push, Betty, push!</i>

1176
01:27:28,821 --> 01:27:32,757
It's coming! It's coming, Betty!
Come on. Push, honey, push!

1177
01:27:41,333 --> 01:27:45,099
Oh. Oh, it's so beautiful.

1178
01:27:45,170 --> 01:27:48,071
Our son is born.

1179
01:27:48,140 --> 01:27:50,506
Kunta Skolnick!

1180
01:27:58,517 --> 01:28:00,883
Behold the nerd child.

1181
01:28:05,257 --> 01:28:09,216
I see before me two souls
who desire to be joined together.

1182
01:28:09,294 --> 01:28:11,387
<i>There's no greater challenge in life...</i>

1183
01:28:11,463 --> 01:28:15,729
and also, no greater reward.

1184
01:28:20,606 --> 01:28:24,838
Do you, Dudley Dawson, take this woman,
Jean Lagarde Humphrey...

1185
01:28:24,910 --> 01:28:28,277
<i>to be your lawful wife?</i>

1186
01:28:28,347 --> 01:28:31,339
Before I answer that,
I just want to say...

1187
01:28:31,416 --> 01:28:33,714
that this is
the happiest moment of my life.

1188
01:28:37,389 --> 01:28:39,323
I do.

1189
01:28:39,391 --> 01:28:42,758
And do you, Jean Lagarde Humphrey,
take this man, Dudley Dawson...

1190
01:28:42,828 --> 01:28:44,921
to be your lawfully wedded husband?

1191
01:28:44,997 --> 01:28:46,988
Excuse me.

1192
01:28:48,600 --> 01:28:51,933
I'm going to love you
till the end of time.

1193
01:28:55,107 --> 01:28:58,873
- I do.
- Then with the power invested in me...

1194
01:28:58,944 --> 01:29:02,903
by the Tilhoon Institute
of Home Learning Church...

1195
01:29:02,981 --> 01:29:05,677
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

1196
01:29:24,836 --> 01:29:28,704
Nerds forever!
Forever nerds!

1197
01:29:28,774 --> 01:29:32,437
Nerds! Nerds! Nerds!

1198
01:29:32,511 --> 01:29:36,379
<i>Nerds! Nerds! Nerds!</i>

1199
01:30:05,644 --> 01:30:08,010
Ooh, ooh, ooh.

1200
01:30:13,685 --> 01:30:16,347
Oh, Aaron.

1201
01:31:21,620 --> 01:31:24,680
Lewis, thanks for everything.

1202
01:31:26,658 --> 01:31:28,990
It's gonna be a great year.
