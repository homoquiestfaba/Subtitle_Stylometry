1
00:00:54,654 --> 00:00:59,489
In the middle of Huntington,
West Virginia, there is a river.

2
00:01:03,897 --> 00:01:06,991
Next to this river, there is a steel mill.

3
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:14,866
And next to the steel mill,
there is a school.

4
00:01:20,246 --> 00:01:23,511
In the middle of this school,
there is a fountain.

5
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:31,414
Each year, on the exact same day,
at the exact same hour...

6
00:01:31,591 --> 00:01:34,424
...the water to this fountain is turned off.

7
00:01:35,762 --> 00:01:39,027
And in this moment, once every year...

8
00:01:40,133 --> 00:01:44,194
...throughout the town,
throughout the school...

9
00:01:45,405 --> 00:01:47,771
...time stands still.

10
00:02:04,958 --> 00:02:07,984
Chris Griffen with a reception.
That is a first down.

11
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:13,224
But Marshall is all out of time-outs,
and the clock is now ticking.

12
00:02:13,399 --> 00:02:16,562
If they wanna get another play off,
the Herd had better hurry.

13
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:20,368
Call it in, Red! Call it in!

14
00:02:23,510 --> 00:02:27,810
- Griffen! Okay, Chris Griffen! Hustle up!
- I'm good, I'm good.

15
00:02:27,981 --> 00:02:29,710
The Herd looks a little disorganized.

16
00:02:29,883 --> 00:02:34,081
They're looking for a play from the sideline,
and they are almost out of time.

17
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:37,382
We are talking about seconds.
Marshall needs to get down and over...

18
00:02:37,557 --> 00:02:39,548
- 77-Victory. Go! Go, go, go!
- Yes, sir.

19
00:02:39,726 --> 00:02:41,557
77-Victory. You're out.

20
00:02:42,362 --> 00:02:46,423
V, 77! V, 77!

21
00:02:52,305 --> 00:02:53,932
Come on! Snap the ball!

22
00:02:54,807 --> 00:02:56,297
Set!

23
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:01,003
Snap it! Snap it! Snap it!

24
00:03:01,915 --> 00:03:03,382
Come on!

25
00:03:04,250 --> 00:03:05,547
Hut!

26
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:17,223
Strong side! He's open!

27
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:19,763
He's open! Throw!

28
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:36,777
And that'll be it for the Herd.

29
00:03:38,084 --> 00:03:40,314
That's right, the clock has hit all zeroes...

30
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:43,546
...and the Carolina faithful
are already on their feet.

31
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:44,951
So there you have it.

32
00:03:45,124 --> 00:03:46,887
- It's all over, folks.
- Good game, Red.

33
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:51,554
Marshall loses a tough one,
17-14 to the East Carolina Pirates.

34
00:03:51,731 --> 00:03:53,562
Red's got his work cut out for him.

35
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:57,965
Well, there goes my weekend.
Red'll be in the film room till Monday.

36
00:03:58,137 --> 00:03:59,434
He'd better.

37
00:03:59,606 --> 00:04:02,404
Your husband hasn't figured out
how to beat the 3-4 all year.

38
00:04:02,575 --> 00:04:04,907
Co-captain Nate Ruffin
and cornerback Tom Bogdan...

39
00:04:05,078 --> 00:04:08,639
...are two of four starters who were
left back in Huntington due to injuries.

40
00:04:08,815 --> 00:04:12,683
Surprised to see you. Figured the chairman
of the school board would be at the game.

41
00:04:12,852 --> 00:04:15,047
This place won't run itself,
you know that.

42
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:17,951
- Furnace ready for the tap?
- Yeah.

43
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:23,489
The next week is a must-win.

44
00:04:23,663 --> 00:04:25,460
They're all must-wins, Gene.

45
00:04:25,632 --> 00:04:29,728
No word yet on whether any or all of the
injured players will be available next...

46
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:37,804
Hey, Sandy, can I get
some more foil in here?

47
00:04:38,678 --> 00:04:42,944
The score, 17-14, East Carolina Pirates.
Quarterback Teddy Shoebridge...

48
00:04:43,116 --> 00:04:44,583
I got it!

49
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:53,315
Hey, where's the flag?
Where's the flag? Flag on...

50
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:57,020
Fifty-five! Blocking in the...

51
00:04:57,196 --> 00:05:00,097
...if that confusion on the Marshall sideline
at the end of the game...

52
00:05:00,266 --> 00:05:04,202
...won't make that target on
Coach Tolley's back a little bit bigger.

53
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:08,238
I'm not gonna ask you guys again.
Dinner's ready.

54
00:05:09,809 --> 00:05:11,640
That means you too, Keith.

55
00:05:11,811 --> 00:05:14,609
Please, just a few more seconds?
Dad's not off yet.

56
00:05:14,781 --> 00:05:17,944
He'll still be droning on about that game
when he gets home tonight.

57
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:20,176
Get out from under there,
Keith Morehouse.

58
00:05:20,353 --> 00:05:24,881
I'm Gene Morehouse saying
good night, and go Herd!

59
00:05:25,158 --> 00:05:26,455
Fellas...

60
00:05:28,027 --> 00:05:30,393
...you gave a good effort out there today.

61
00:05:33,066 --> 00:05:35,193
But let me be clear about this:

62
00:05:35,601 --> 00:05:39,093
A good effort is not enough.

63
00:05:42,842 --> 00:05:44,707
Now, I'm proud of you.

64
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,141
But I will not accept losing with you.

65
00:05:49,749 --> 00:05:52,081
Because there's only one thing
they judge us on.

66
00:05:52,251 --> 00:05:54,981
There's only one thing people remember.

67
00:05:56,022 --> 00:05:58,684
And it ain't how we play the game!

68
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,354
Winning...

69
00:06:05,398 --> 00:06:07,025
...is everything.

70
00:06:11,003 --> 00:06:12,368
Plane leaves in an hour.

71
00:06:13,139 --> 00:06:15,198
We'll be home by 8.

72
00:06:15,375 --> 00:06:19,539
Plenty of time for y'all to do whatever
the hell y'all do on a Saturday night.

73
00:06:24,317 --> 00:06:27,286
Now, see, Bogdan, the reason we lost
is because we weren't there.

74
00:06:27,453 --> 00:06:31,321
Chocolate Thunder, White Lightning? We the
best defensive players in the conference.

75
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,856
I'm Chocolate Thunder, right?

76
00:06:33,025 --> 00:06:35,721
Why you so scared to introduce me
to your girlfriend, then?

77
00:06:35,895 --> 00:06:37,920
Listen, stop being so
overconfident, Ruffin.

78
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:41,863
All right, Rock, Paper, Scissors for tickets.
Let's go, right now.

79
00:06:44,103 --> 00:06:45,593
It's okay. I'll get the popcorn.

80
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:47,433
East Carolina?

81
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,440
I mean, I can understand giving up
300 yards to Bowling Green.

82
00:06:50,610 --> 00:06:51,941
But East Carolina?

83
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:55,137
Well, you can't do nothing
about injuries, you know?

84
00:06:55,715 --> 00:06:57,706
What happened? Is it broken?

85
00:06:57,884 --> 00:06:59,784
It's dislocated.

86
00:06:59,952 --> 00:07:01,943
What's wrong with you, Tom?

87
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:04,822
Come on, man. Gonna miss the previews.

88
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:09,223
Nineteen carries, 108 yards, Paul,
your boy Chris played a hell of a game.

89
00:07:09,395 --> 00:07:11,863
I'd have taken the win any day.
Isn't that right, Don?

90
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,056
What, now, we didn't win?

91
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:18,404
You of all people, Don.
If you're not gonna listen to the game...

92
00:07:18,571 --> 00:07:21,165
...you gotta know the result
so you can pretend you did.

93
00:07:21,340 --> 00:07:23,535
- Well, I'm doing my best, Paul.
- You hungry?

94
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,643
No, thank you. I'm all set.

95
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:28,645
Lloyd? Usual for me tonight,
just more of it. I'm starving.

96
00:07:28,815 --> 00:07:30,874
- You got it.
- Go ahead, excuse me.

97
00:07:31,050 --> 00:07:34,042
Well, the board has asked me
to run a few ideas through you...

98
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,281
...about some potential improvements
to the university's physical plant.

99
00:07:48,634 --> 00:07:50,363
There's Chris!

100
00:07:53,773 --> 00:07:57,174
What took you so long to call?
Tell Joe he can't run it to the inside...

101
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,971
Slow down, Reggie. Just listen.

102
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:03,946
- I just need a favor, not your life story.
- What you need?

103
00:08:04,116 --> 00:08:08,985
I need you to go get us a case
of Falls City Beer. Falls City.

104
00:08:09,155 --> 00:08:12,750
- Go to the liquor store on Fourth. Yeah.
- Fourth Street?

105
00:08:12,925 --> 00:08:15,519
- Hey, are the guys with you?
- Yeah, Reggie.

106
00:08:15,695 --> 00:08:17,686
What is it, godd...?

107
00:08:18,364 --> 00:08:21,800
That's right, Reggie. You carry the two
and you divide by the sum...

108
00:08:21,968 --> 00:08:25,460
Yeah, math class is over.
Let's get on the plane. Come on.

109
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:31,039
- I'll see you in a couple of hours, right?
- You know you are.

110
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:33,337
- I'm gonna stay at my dad's house tonight.
- No.

111
00:08:33,513 --> 00:08:36,209
He's gonna wanna go over his
post-game breakdown.

112
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:39,015
Sorry. We've been doing it
since I was a kid.

113
00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:41,346
You gonna tell him about California, right?

114
00:08:41,521 --> 00:08:45,355
Are you kidding? After a loss?
We want him in a good mood.

115
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:47,117
Yeah.

116
00:08:47,393 --> 00:08:50,157
Don't worry. I will.

117
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,166
Just not this weekend.

118
00:08:54,333 --> 00:08:56,460
Griffen! Let's go!

119
00:08:57,436 --> 00:08:59,427
I love you, Chris Griffen.

120
00:09:00,506 --> 00:09:02,497
Come on, Annie!

121
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:06,844
- Race you back.
- Let's go! Hurry up!

122
00:09:07,013 --> 00:09:08,913
I'm coming!

123
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,249
What's this concert you're missing?

124
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:20,415
It's just my granddaughter's piano recital.
Man, she sure is cute when she does that.

125
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:23,391
That's the crap I missed
first time around with my boys.

126
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:24,996
Now they got kids of their own.

127
00:09:25,164 --> 00:09:28,224
Anyway, got a long ride ahead of me.
Have a great flight.

128
00:09:28,401 --> 00:09:30,995
Hutch, tell you what,
I'll do the recruiting trip.

129
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:35,607
You go home and see your granddaughter's
recital. I'm gonna do it. I'm doing it.

130
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,743
- Thanks, Red. All right.
- I'll see you on Monday morning.

131
00:09:42,582 --> 00:09:44,447
Good man, Red.

132
00:09:45,318 --> 00:09:47,684
You can grab me a beer back home.

133
00:09:57,463 --> 00:10:00,591
Because if he keeps on pulling
and no money comes out...

134
00:10:00,766 --> 00:10:02,358
- Good evening.
- Doris.

135
00:10:02,535 --> 00:10:05,436
It's Red Dawson, calling from Greenville.

136
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,373
Could I trouble you to look and see
if Carole's home next door?

137
00:10:12,178 --> 00:10:13,611
Sure doesn't look like it, Red.

138
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,646
Could you do me a big favor
and leave her a message for me?

139
00:10:16,816 --> 00:10:20,183
Tell her that I gotta drive to Virginia
tonight on a recruiting trip...

140
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,378
...and I'm not gonna be home
till tomorrow.

141
00:10:22,555 --> 00:10:24,716
- Got it.
- All right, you have a good night, now.

142
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:27,415
- All right, bye.
- Night, Red.

143
00:10:45,011 --> 00:10:48,572
- You thinking about that girlfriend of yours?
- Yeah, coach.

144
00:10:50,016 --> 00:10:51,677
Nice job, son.

145
00:10:53,019 --> 00:10:54,816
Hey, that was a big hit today. Big hit.

146
00:10:54,987 --> 00:10:57,080
I would've caught that pass
if I had my cross.

147
00:10:57,256 --> 00:10:58,484
What'd you do with it?

148
00:10:58,658 --> 00:11:02,116
You would've caught it if you had good
hands. Ain't that right, Shoebridge?

149
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:07,163
Hey, Gene, this is gonna sound a little
weird, but I need you to do me a favor.

150
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:10,530
Want you to scratch my back.
That target on there is starting to itch.

151
00:11:10,703 --> 00:11:13,035
You can't believe everything
you hear on the radio.

152
00:11:13,205 --> 00:11:15,105
Oh, yeah, I can.

153
00:11:18,577 --> 00:11:23,344
All right, boys, let's sit up straight.
Tighten those ties, fix those collars.

154
00:11:23,516 --> 00:11:25,450
- We are?
- Marshall!

155
00:11:26,252 --> 00:11:27,719
Almost home.

156
00:11:30,222 --> 00:11:32,452
This is Captain Dettro speaking.

157
00:11:32,625 --> 00:11:35,287
Looks like we made good time
in spite of the weather...

158
00:11:35,461 --> 00:11:40,262
...so if everyone could return to their
seats now, we'll be landing shortly.

159
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:11,526
Fill her up for you?

160
00:12:11,764 --> 00:12:13,129
Yes, sir.

161
00:12:18,871 --> 00:12:20,600
These peanuts look good.

162
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:24,208
I'll get a bunch of them too.

163
00:12:24,376 --> 00:12:27,504
Sure. They're just 50 cents.
Help yourself.

164
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:30,649
Regular's on the left,
Cajun's on the right.

165
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:33,080
Incredibly, there has been
another plane crash...

166
00:12:33,252 --> 00:12:34,981
How spicy are these Cajun...?

167
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,385
...in moderate rain and fog
in West Virginia.

168
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:40,286
What did he just say?

169
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:42,324
- Wait. Turn that up.
- No, what happened...

170
00:12:42,495 --> 00:12:43,723
What did that say?

171
00:12:43,896 --> 00:12:47,457
Early reports do not indicate
the condition of those aboard.

172
00:12:54,140 --> 00:12:55,437
Excuse me, everybody...

173
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,007
Annette said you look funny
when you're getting dressed.

174
00:13:02,615 --> 00:13:04,708
Bye, Carole.
Say hello to your husband for me.

175
00:13:04,884 --> 00:13:07,717
- This is Lloyd.
- See you, Lloyd!

176
00:13:15,594 --> 00:13:17,152
What's happened?

177
00:13:29,742 --> 00:13:31,437
Hey!

178
00:13:34,180 --> 00:13:36,876
- Hey, you going to the airport?
- Yeah, get in.

179
00:13:37,049 --> 00:13:40,917
All right. I'm getting in. Hold on.
All right, good.

180
00:13:59,905 --> 00:14:02,135
- Hey, did they say anything?
- Hey, come on!

181
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:05,766
No one's going in there.
I can't let you up there.

182
00:14:05,945 --> 00:14:07,970
- Get that truck up the hill!
- Come on!

183
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:09,546
Hey, Randy!

184
00:14:11,517 --> 00:14:13,109
Come on, keep going, come on.

185
00:14:17,756 --> 00:14:19,451
Hey, watch the hose!

186
00:14:31,337 --> 00:14:34,568
Got the president of the university here!

187
00:14:36,442 --> 00:14:38,433
Oh, my God in heaven.

188
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,536
Oh, my God.

189
00:14:46,952 --> 00:14:48,613
Come on.

190
00:14:50,155 --> 00:14:51,850
Let's go.

191
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:56,184
- Hey, get behind the ropes!
- Just tell us the name of the airline!

192
00:14:56,362 --> 00:14:59,729
- If I knew anything, I'd tell you!
- Just look at the front of the plane!

193
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:02,925
Son, there is no
front of the plane anymore.

194
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:07,903
Bring another hose down here!

195
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:10,837
No, stay back. Stay up there! No!

196
00:15:11,010 --> 00:15:14,002
- Let's go!
- Nate! Nate Ruffin!

197
00:15:14,947 --> 00:15:18,576
This our boys' plane?
This our boys' plane?!

198
00:16:48,774 --> 00:16:50,674
It's so terrible.

199
00:17:39,024 --> 00:17:40,252
You didn't get my message?

200
00:18:00,712 --> 00:18:04,170
Marshall University in West Virginia
is in a state of shock today...

201
00:18:04,349 --> 00:18:08,877
...following the terrible tragedy of last
Saturday night's crash of a chartered airline.

202
00:18:09,054 --> 00:18:11,181
Seventy-five people died in the wreckage.

203
00:18:11,356 --> 00:18:13,085
The football team, the coaches...

204
00:18:13,258 --> 00:18:16,421
...and some prominent residents
traveling with the team...

205
00:18:47,526 --> 00:18:49,687
These were beautiful young men...

206
00:18:49,862 --> 00:18:55,061
...and it's just a tragedy
that is beyond all comprehension.

207
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:28,866
No one of us will ever
enter this stadium...

208
00:19:29,034 --> 00:19:32,060
...without thoughts of them.

209
00:19:32,971 --> 00:19:39,206
And so, our Lord, grant them
eternal rest and peace...

210
00:19:39,478 --> 00:19:42,641
...which enables them
at this very moment...

211
00:19:42,814 --> 00:19:48,411
...to look upon us here
and smile and be with us.

212
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:53,320
This is our faith, this is our hope.

213
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,086
Amen.

214
00:20:27,025 --> 00:20:29,459
Those were not welcome days.

215
00:20:30,862 --> 00:20:32,762
We buried sons...

216
00:20:32,965 --> 00:20:34,626
...brothers...

217
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:36,267
...mothers...

218
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:38,528
...fathers...

219
00:20:39,304 --> 00:20:40,794
...fiancés.

220
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:52,675
Clocks ticked, but time did not pass.

221
00:21:00,292 --> 00:21:03,523
The sun rose and the sun set.

222
00:21:05,197 --> 00:21:07,665
But the shadows remained.

223
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:13,532
When once there was sound...

224
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:17,608
...now there was silence.

225
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:30,220
What once was whole...

226
00:21:31,223 --> 00:21:33,623
...now is shattered.

227
00:22:02,187 --> 00:22:04,849
Have you mentioned this
to any of the other board members?

228
00:22:05,023 --> 00:22:09,016
A few. Most of them
would prefer not to think about it.

229
00:22:09,194 --> 00:22:12,254
I can understand that sentiment.

230
00:22:12,431 --> 00:22:16,128
It doesn't make sense to rush
right back into it, you know?

231
00:22:16,301 --> 00:22:19,634
Our coaching staff, gone.
Our athletic department, gone.

232
00:22:19,805 --> 00:22:22,968
So many of our boosters, gone.

233
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:25,666
We'd have to start
all over again from scratch.

234
00:22:25,844 --> 00:22:30,042
My God, we don't have the resources
or the manpower right now.

235
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:33,184
I know all the reasons
to suspend the program, Paul.

236
00:22:33,352 --> 00:22:35,479
I'm just surprised to hear it
coming from you.

237
00:22:35,654 --> 00:22:37,815
This town just didn't lose
a football team, Don.

238
00:22:37,989 --> 00:22:41,618
We lost doctors, lawyers,
city councilmen.

239
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:44,284
We lost fathers, sons, husbands.

240
00:22:44,463 --> 00:22:49,457
How many kids lost a parent?
How many kids lost both parents?

241
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:53,297
- Twenty-eight.
- Wouldn't be a game anymore, Don.

242
00:22:54,072 --> 00:22:56,768
Be a weekly reminder of what we've lost.

243
00:22:57,943 --> 00:23:02,209
And I just don't see how that would
do anyone in this town any good.

244
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:06,711
Somebody's going to
have to tell them, Paul.

245
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:12,114
All your scholarships will still be honored.

246
00:23:12,824 --> 00:23:17,557
Boys, it's very important that
we take a collective breath, as a town...

247
00:23:17,729 --> 00:23:20,289
...and figure out the
proper course of action.

248
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:23,662
And you think the proper course of action
is ending the program?

249
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:28,238
I didn't say we were going to end the
program, I said we are going to suspend it.

250
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:33,835
Look, under the best of circumstances,
it takes years to build a team...

251
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:37,614
...and, well, these are not
the best of circumstances.

252
00:23:37,783 --> 00:23:40,616
The NCAA will not let freshmen play...

253
00:23:40,786 --> 00:23:44,244
...and they are the only players
we have besides you.

254
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:49,284
When we do bring the program back, we
want to make sure we're able to do it right.

255
00:23:49,461 --> 00:23:52,294
If. That's what you mean, right?

256
00:23:52,464 --> 00:23:54,329
If they bring the program back?

257
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:01,299
This ain't right, Dr. Dedmon.
It ain't fair!

258
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:04,101
I understand your position, son.

259
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:08,312
I will personally pass on your concerns to
the board before they make their decision.

260
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,345
Why can't I pass on
my concerns myself?

261
00:24:11,650 --> 00:24:15,245
Well, unfortunately, board of governors'
meetings are and always have been...

262
00:24:15,420 --> 00:24:16,648
...closed-door.

263
00:24:20,859 --> 00:24:22,190
Come on!

264
00:24:22,360 --> 00:24:24,225
Everybody up! Let's go. Come on.

265
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:26,489
Reggie, put down the stick. Come on.

266
00:24:26,665 --> 00:24:28,326
I need y'all to listen.

267
00:24:29,267 --> 00:24:33,397
Now, as of 15 minutes ago,
we ain't got football no more.

268
00:24:35,273 --> 00:24:38,436
If you gonna be Marshall,
you gonna be Marshall right now.

269
00:24:39,411 --> 00:24:41,208
Earn your stripes.

270
00:24:44,316 --> 00:24:47,251
Now, I want the two of you
to go with Randy...

271
00:24:47,419 --> 00:24:50,547
...and get every cheerleader and every girl
you can possibly find...

272
00:24:50,722 --> 00:24:54,419
...and get them here at 5:00. The two
of y'all, I need you to go with George...

273
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:58,085
...and find every cat in them frat houses
and get them here at 5:00.

274
00:24:58,263 --> 00:24:59,924
Go, now, go!

275
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:01,656
I need you on this one, Reggie.

276
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:04,332
I need you, man.

277
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:07,734
Find every person y'all met
in freshman orientation...

278
00:25:07,906 --> 00:25:10,374
...and I need them here at 5:00.

279
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:13,807
All right? Come on! Now! Come on!

280
00:25:14,246 --> 00:25:16,009
- Five o'clock!
- Nate.

281
00:25:16,181 --> 00:25:18,240
- Yeah.
- Come here a sec.

282
00:25:19,551 --> 00:25:22,611
Hey, I heard that some
of the guys are wavering.

283
00:25:23,755 --> 00:25:26,121
- Wavering?
- Yeah, they're just kind of...

284
00:25:26,291 --> 00:25:30,660
No, no, no. What you mean? What you
talking about? Who's wavering, Tom?

285
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:35,192
They don't feel it's the right thing to do
right now, step out on that field.

286
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,961
It's the only thing to do, Tom.

287
00:25:38,136 --> 00:25:40,696
This about our teammates, man.

288
00:25:41,172 --> 00:25:43,970
Now, I need to know
who you talking about.

289
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:48,240
No one, man.

290
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,681
Five o'clock. All right?

291
00:25:53,051 --> 00:25:55,076
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

292
00:25:55,253 --> 00:25:57,881
- You all right?
- Forget it.

293
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,889
I was just having some thoughts.
I'm ready, man. Let's go.

294
00:26:02,127 --> 00:26:04,425
- We gonna get this team back, man.
- Yeah.

295
00:26:08,166 --> 00:26:11,158
Okay, I think we all know
why we're here today.

296
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:13,361
What I'd like to do first...

297
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:23,809
Excuse me, young man.
Excuse me, this is a private meeting.

298
00:26:24,316 --> 00:26:28,810
I don't mean to interrupt, sir, but I think
there's something y'all need to hear.

299
00:26:29,254 --> 00:26:33,850
If you have anything to say, we'll set up
a time for you to come by my office.

300
00:26:34,859 --> 00:26:38,590
Oh, no, sir. I ain't got nothing to say.

301
00:26:42,634 --> 00:26:44,534
But they do.

302
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:27,907
We are Marshall! We are Marshall!

303
00:27:28,079 --> 00:27:30,639
We are Marshall!

304
00:27:30,815 --> 00:27:33,511
We are Marshall!

305
00:27:33,685 --> 00:27:36,245
We are Marshall!

306
00:27:36,421 --> 00:27:38,651
We are Marshall!

307
00:27:38,823 --> 00:27:41,189
We are Marshall!

308
00:27:41,359 --> 00:27:44,157
We are Marshall!

309
00:27:44,329 --> 00:27:46,524
We are Marshall!

310
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,223
We are Marshall!

311
00:27:49,401 --> 00:27:52,370
We are Marshall!

312
00:27:52,537 --> 00:27:55,267
We are Marshall!

313
00:27:55,440 --> 00:27:57,670
We are Marshall!

314
00:27:57,842 --> 00:28:00,242
We are Marshall!

315
00:28:00,412 --> 00:28:02,846
We are Marshall!

316
00:28:03,014 --> 00:28:05,778
We are Marshall!

317
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:08,043
We are Marshall!

318
00:28:08,219 --> 00:28:10,813
We are Marshall!

319
00:28:12,090 --> 00:28:13,614
Paul.

320
00:28:14,092 --> 00:28:16,492
We are Marshall!

321
00:28:16,661 --> 00:28:19,459
We are Marshall!

322
00:28:19,631 --> 00:28:22,429
It's the right thing to do, sir.

323
00:28:26,171 --> 00:28:32,337
Son, we do not have a team.
We do not have a staff.

324
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:37,948
We don't even have a damn
athletic director. May he rest in peace.

325
00:28:39,617 --> 00:28:44,179
Frankly, son, I wouldn't know
where to begin.

326
00:28:45,290 --> 00:28:47,758
Well, you can start with a coach, sir.

327
00:28:48,927 --> 00:28:54,559
We are Marshall! We are Marshall!

328
00:28:54,733 --> 00:29:00,467
We are Marshall! We are Marshall!

329
00:29:00,638 --> 00:29:06,235
We are Marshall! We are Marshall!

330
00:29:06,411 --> 00:29:10,074
We are Marshall!

331
00:29:16,387 --> 00:29:17,786
Hey, Mr. Boone.

332
00:29:19,190 --> 00:29:21,351
Annie, honey, come here.

333
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,389
You don't have to come back
to work right away.

334
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:28,828
Take some time for yourself.
The job will be waiting when you get back.

335
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,764
One thing I don't need
is more time for myself.

336
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,262
I just want things to get back to normal.

337
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:42,780
Hi, Mr. Griffen.

338
00:29:43,648 --> 00:29:47,209
It's good to see you.
Glad you're not giving up the booth.

339
00:29:47,385 --> 00:29:51,685
I've been coming here every day
for 30 years. No reason to stop now.

340
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:11,975
I think you should have this back.

341
00:30:14,679 --> 00:30:16,806
Chris gave it to you.

342
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,174
Yeah, he did.

343
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:24,247
But you gave it to your wife first.

344
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,626
And then you passed it down to him...

345
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:31,724
...so I'm passing it back up to you.

346
00:30:33,531 --> 00:30:36,091
It should stay in your family.

347
00:30:38,503 --> 00:30:40,471
What family?

348
00:30:43,641 --> 00:30:45,108
Annie...

349
00:30:46,377 --> 00:30:48,140
...you keep it.

350
00:30:48,546 --> 00:30:52,846
Wear it. And every morning
you put it on, you think of him.

351
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,878
- Don.
- Red.

352
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,723
What are you working on there?

353
00:31:34,893 --> 00:31:39,057
Well, I been promising Carole
a new shed for a while now, so...

354
00:31:39,230 --> 00:31:41,664
No time like the present, I guess.

355
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:45,565
Red, I've got an offer for you.

356
00:31:51,075 --> 00:31:53,305
I was afraid you might.

357
00:32:02,587 --> 00:32:05,420
Mrs. Dawson, if it had been me...

358
00:32:05,590 --> 00:32:09,117
...I don't even know how I'd make it out
of bed in the morning.

359
00:32:11,562 --> 00:32:14,190
Let him build a hundred sheds.

360
00:32:18,703 --> 00:32:21,604
Hello, this is President Donald Dedmon.

361
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:27,370
We've decided to go ahead
with our football program next season...

362
00:32:27,545 --> 00:32:32,141
...and your name was the first
on a list of potential candidates...

363
00:32:32,317 --> 00:32:36,276
...for the head coaching position.

364
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:41,186
Well, no, I completely
understand. I just...

365
00:32:41,359 --> 00:32:44,123
You were the first one
on my list, so I...

366
00:32:49,434 --> 00:32:53,564
No. No, we decided
to bring the program back.

367
00:32:54,138 --> 00:32:57,164
Yes, it wasn't an easy decision.

368
00:32:57,342 --> 00:33:00,971
No, that's totally understandable. I...

369
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:07,348
Well, thank you very much for...

370
00:33:07,518 --> 00:33:11,010
...well, taking the time
to at least talk with me about it.

371
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:19,255
As I've been told,
you had a great career at Marshall and...

372
00:33:25,570 --> 00:33:27,162
Yes, thank you.

373
00:33:29,774 --> 00:33:31,833
No, I understand.

374
00:33:32,643 --> 00:33:34,338
No, I...

375
00:33:34,545 --> 00:33:36,536
Please, it's...

376
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:43,547
Hey, honey?

377
00:33:44,622 --> 00:33:46,214
You ever been to Huntington before?

378
00:33:46,391 --> 00:33:49,554
Mouth closed, Peter. Thank you.

379
00:33:49,727 --> 00:33:51,217
West Virginia?

380
00:33:51,396 --> 00:33:52,795
No.

381
00:33:53,164 --> 00:33:54,631
Why?

382
00:33:55,299 --> 00:33:57,028
Just curious.

383
00:33:57,435 --> 00:34:00,199
- Hey, Peter.
- Yeah?

384
00:34:04,542 --> 00:34:07,010
Been quieter than I would've
guessed this morning.

385
00:34:07,578 --> 00:34:10,012
Ernie Salvatore called from the Herald.

386
00:34:10,181 --> 00:34:12,741
Says he wants to talk
if you have a moment.

387
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:14,908
Oh, and there was another call.

388
00:34:15,086 --> 00:34:19,250
A Jack Lengyel called
from the College of Wooster.

389
00:34:19,424 --> 00:34:23,793
Says he may be interested
in the open coaching job.

390
00:34:24,228 --> 00:34:25,820
Wooster.

391
00:34:25,997 --> 00:34:27,988
Where in the world is Wooster?

392
00:34:28,266 --> 00:34:30,894
Does it really matter?

393
00:34:36,808 --> 00:34:39,333
Okay, now, let's show Dr. Dedmon
how it's done here.

394
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:43,970
Run hard, knees high. Play till
the whistle blows. 17-Razor, on three.

395
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:47,447
On three, 17-Razor.
Hut, hut, hut. Go, go, go!

396
00:34:47,618 --> 00:34:51,987
There he goes. There he goes.
Oh, first down!

397
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,957
- You see that? Oh, yeah.
- Is he all right?

398
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:58,186
Hey, 32, are you all right?
All right, go kill your brother.

399
00:34:58,362 --> 00:35:01,388
Now, you see that? Point is,
that tree wouldn't have been there...

400
00:35:01,566 --> 00:35:03,534
...if you had a fullback blocking for him.

401
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:06,465
And that is why I'm a fan
of the Power I Formation.

402
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:12,371
Well, I'm sorry, I'm afraid I haven't the
faintest idea what a Power I Formation is.

403
00:35:12,543 --> 00:35:14,238
Oh, you don't?
Oh, thank you, dear.

404
00:35:14,412 --> 00:35:16,403
- You're welcome.
- Power I Formation...

405
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:20,847
...is just your basic offensive scheme.
Put the fullback in front of the tailback.

406
00:35:21,018 --> 00:35:24,181
Now, frankly, Jack, I don't care to know.

407
00:35:24,522 --> 00:35:30,154
Actually, I'm confident that I'm better off
not knowing what one is, I think.

408
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:36,129
Well, Dr. Dedmon, on that,
we will have to agree to disagree.

409
00:35:36,501 --> 00:35:37,900
Thank you.

410
00:35:40,371 --> 00:35:44,068
Jack, there is one thing I need to know...

411
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:46,708
...and please excuse me if I seem blunt.

412
00:35:47,879 --> 00:35:52,441
You are the first person I've interviewed
who is not an alumnus.

413
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:56,112
And, well, since you called us...

414
00:35:56,521 --> 00:36:00,150
...I have to ask what your angle is, Jack.

415
00:36:01,125 --> 00:36:05,653
You've got a great setup here.
You have no ties to Marshall.

416
00:36:06,063 --> 00:36:08,531
Why do you want this job?

417
00:36:08,699 --> 00:36:11,293
Who in their right mind
would volunteer for something...?

418
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:14,529
Son, don't put that in your mouth.
No, put it down. That's right.

419
00:36:14,705 --> 00:36:18,163
- It's not an outrageous question, I think.
- What's he gonna do?

420
00:36:18,342 --> 00:36:21,277
He's gonna put it in his pants?
I bet he puts it in his pants.

421
00:36:21,445 --> 00:36:25,006
- Son, don't put that in your pant... Sandy!
- I got it. Peter.

422
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,548
I'm sorry, excuse me.

423
00:36:26,717 --> 00:36:31,950
Well, I was just wondering if you had
given this any thought at all...

424
00:36:32,123 --> 00:36:34,990
...before you asked me to drive 200 miles
out here to see you.

425
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:38,055
A little bit, yeah.

426
00:36:38,529 --> 00:36:40,121
Little bit.

427
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:47,295
Well, all right, then.

428
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,670
I have a long ride home...

429
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:53,503
...and I should be getting on with it.

430
00:36:53,678 --> 00:36:56,374
You thank your wife for the lovely dinner.

431
00:36:56,547 --> 00:36:58,708
- Are you sure? Okay.
- Yes, thank...

432
00:36:58,883 --> 00:37:00,350
Thank you.

433
00:37:03,554 --> 00:37:05,215
Say, Don?

434
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:10,585
You wanna know why
I picked up the phone? Is that it?

435
00:37:10,761 --> 00:37:12,991
Frankly, I do.

436
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:17,725
- It's not gonna be complicated.
- Jack, I've had four months of complicated.

437
00:37:17,902 --> 00:37:19,494
I just need honest.

438
00:37:33,084 --> 00:37:37,748
When I heard about
what had happened, your situation...

439
00:37:39,290 --> 00:37:43,750
...the only thing I could think about
was the four of them.

440
00:37:46,597 --> 00:37:49,498
I thought about how much
they mean to me...

441
00:37:51,135 --> 00:37:53,603
...and about how bad it would hurt if...

442
00:37:55,506 --> 00:37:57,599
Well, if I was to lose them.

443
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:04,278
Then I thought about a team...

444
00:38:06,417 --> 00:38:08,146
...and a school...

445
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:11,411
...and a town...

446
00:38:12,757 --> 00:38:14,486
...that's gotta be hurting real bad.

447
00:38:17,295 --> 00:38:19,195
And I thought, hell...

448
00:38:19,997 --> 00:38:21,828
...maybe I can help.

449
00:38:27,938 --> 00:38:29,906
So I called you.

450
00:38:34,512 --> 00:38:35,945
Yeah.

451
00:38:37,948 --> 00:38:41,406
I guess that's the only real "why" I got.
Right there.

452
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:44,049
Touchdown.

453
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:51,160
Ladies and gentlemen...

454
00:38:51,329 --> 00:38:55,857
...please welcome the new head coach
of our Thundering Herd...

455
00:38:56,033 --> 00:38:57,728
...Jack Lengyel.

456
00:39:05,810 --> 00:39:07,402
Hi there.

457
00:39:16,821 --> 00:39:18,516
Thank you.

458
00:39:22,159 --> 00:39:28,655
I am honored to be the new head
football coach here at Marshall University.

459
00:39:29,767 --> 00:39:35,364
Also would like to say a big thank you
from myself, my wife and our three kids.

460
00:39:35,539 --> 00:39:39,305
We drove in from Wooster last night.
Arrived at our new home here.

461
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:42,844
Electricity worked,
the water pressure was high.

462
00:39:43,013 --> 00:39:46,710
There was a six-pack of beer in the fridge
and a pound cake on the counter.

463
00:39:47,418 --> 00:39:50,478
Four for four.
We appreciate the hospitality, we really do.

464
00:39:53,457 --> 00:39:55,049
Any questions?

465
00:39:56,761 --> 00:39:57,989
- Coach?
- Yes, sir.

466
00:39:58,162 --> 00:40:00,221
Ernie Salvatore, Herald-Dispatch.

467
00:40:00,398 --> 00:40:03,595
Now, realistically, coach,
what are your expectations for the season?

468
00:40:05,136 --> 00:40:07,536
Well, I can tell you this...

469
00:40:08,272 --> 00:40:10,740
...if it's a miracle you're looking for...

470
00:40:11,876 --> 00:40:15,539
...well, you should keep looking, because
you're gonna end up disappointed...

471
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,704
...and I'm gonna end up out of a job.

472
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:21,146
Follow-up, coach. Follow-up.
One quick follow-up, coach.

473
00:40:21,318 --> 00:40:24,082
What would you say to
the family members in the community...

474
00:40:24,255 --> 00:40:29,454
...who feel that putting the team back
on that field might be disrespectful?

475
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,165
I am a football coach.

476
00:40:38,636 --> 00:40:42,367
That is what I do
and that's why I'm here.

477
00:40:44,208 --> 00:40:45,641
I guess that's it.

478
00:40:45,810 --> 00:40:47,835
I have no idea.
What kind of answer was that?

479
00:40:48,012 --> 00:40:49,138
How many clichés...?

480
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,449
Are there any other questions?

481
00:40:52,817 --> 00:40:54,409
This guy won't make it.

482
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:58,982
So this is my varsity team, huh?

483
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,682
There was four of us...

484
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,962
...but one of us ain't here,
so I guess it's just three.

485
00:41:08,499 --> 00:41:09,830
Okay.

486
00:41:11,035 --> 00:41:13,765
I'm Coach Jack Lengyel, guys.

487
00:41:14,071 --> 00:41:16,471
Normally, I'm bad with names,
so the good news is...

488
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,507
...I may actually be able
to keep you fellas straight.

489
00:41:20,044 --> 00:41:21,944
Nate, is it?

490
00:41:22,112 --> 00:41:25,377
Okay, now, hold on
while I commit this to memory. Nate.

491
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,841
As in Nate the Great.

492
00:41:28,018 --> 00:41:30,748
Date, late, escape. Wait. Nate.

493
00:41:30,921 --> 00:41:32,684
McDrake.

494
00:41:32,857 --> 00:41:37,191
I got it. Locked.
Kid I went to grade school with.

495
00:41:37,361 --> 00:41:40,853
See, that's a little word-association trick
I learned. Helps jog the recall.

496
00:41:41,031 --> 00:41:44,228
I read about it in Redbook.
And I tell you what, it really works, too.

497
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:48,029
Well, we're in this together now, boys.

498
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,971
I'm not going anywhere,
and that's a promise.

499
00:41:52,810 --> 00:41:54,072
Already got one name down.

500
00:41:55,212 --> 00:41:57,612
Soon as the wife gets things
settled at the house...

501
00:41:57,781 --> 00:42:01,217
...y'all are coming over for supper,
and I'll get the other two.

502
00:42:03,020 --> 00:42:05,181
We are Marshall.

503
00:42:07,992 --> 00:42:09,857
It's a new day, men.

504
00:42:11,896 --> 00:42:14,729
I like those boys, Don. I do. I do.

505
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,367
The thing is, I'm gonna need
55 more just like them.

506
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,504
Oh, that I can't help you with, I'm afraid.

507
00:42:20,738 --> 00:42:22,831
Well, actually, you can, Don.

508
00:42:23,941 --> 00:42:28,537
You see, I need you to petition
the NCAA for me.

509
00:42:28,712 --> 00:42:33,342
Ask them to make an exception.
Allow us to play freshmen.

510
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:36,577
Now, it's the only chance we have
to get any edge on recruiting...

511
00:42:36,754 --> 00:42:39,450
...much less put a full football team
on the field.

512
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:41,853
I mean, we are way behind here.

513
00:42:42,026 --> 00:42:46,190
Well, you know the NCAA
better than I do, Jack.

514
00:42:46,363 --> 00:42:50,094
They're rigid as a board.
They don't make exceptions.

515
00:42:51,468 --> 00:42:52,935
Usually true.

516
00:42:53,771 --> 00:42:55,102
Yeah.

517
00:42:56,473 --> 00:43:01,410
Hey, you know, my son, he crapped
his pants yesterday. Now, he's 4.

518
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:04,946
All right, now, my wife is out shopping,
so I had to clean him up.

519
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:08,217
She got home. I told her what happened.
She says, "I can't believe it."

520
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:11,149
I said, "I can't believe it either.
The kid's 4 years old...

521
00:43:11,322 --> 00:43:13,586
...he shouldn't be doing that shit."
Pun intended.

522
00:43:13,757 --> 00:43:16,555
You know what she says to me?
She says, "Jack, no, not that.

523
00:43:17,161 --> 00:43:20,597
I can't believe you finally
changed a diaper."

524
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:24,491
What are you talking about?

525
00:43:25,302 --> 00:43:27,600
There's a first time for everything.

526
00:43:31,342 --> 00:43:32,741
Hey, I know you.

527
00:43:32,910 --> 00:43:35,208
In the middle. Yes, I do.

528
00:43:35,379 --> 00:43:39,110
Ask me your name. Go ahead,
I won't even look. Ask me your name.

529
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:43,347
- What's my name?
- Nate Ruffin.

530
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,115
Team co-captain. Eleven interceptions
in only seven games last year.

531
00:43:49,927 --> 00:43:51,485
Redbook.

532
00:43:51,996 --> 00:43:53,486
Stuff really works.

533
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:55,825
Hey, we can do this, doc.

534
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:06,468
What are those, 1-by-5s?

535
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:07,872
One-by-sixes.

536
00:44:09,580 --> 00:44:12,413
They don't look that wide from down here.

537
00:44:15,619 --> 00:44:19,020
- Saw you guys play once.
- Did we win?

538
00:44:19,957 --> 00:44:21,982
It was the Ashland game.

539
00:44:22,292 --> 00:44:23,691
Well, that'd be a no, then.

540
00:44:24,862 --> 00:44:27,990
Well, you guys looked pretty good
till the fourth quarter.

541
00:44:29,133 --> 00:44:31,397
Probably should've gone to the nickel.

542
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:35,497
You know, you're probably right.

543
00:44:35,673 --> 00:44:38,198
You know, I appreciate you
coming out here to see me...

544
00:44:38,375 --> 00:44:42,971
...but they already came out here to ask me
back and I already told them that I'm not...

545
00:44:44,481 --> 00:44:47,575
- ...coming back, so...
- Yeah, I heard. I heard about that.

546
00:44:49,319 --> 00:44:53,085
Just thought I could make you
a better offer.

547
00:44:53,557 --> 00:44:56,321
You know, they asked you
to be the head coach.

548
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:59,161
I want you to be the assistant coach.

549
00:45:01,198 --> 00:45:03,257
I think that's a demotion, Jack.

550
00:45:03,434 --> 00:45:04,958
Well, maybe.

551
00:45:05,402 --> 00:45:06,869
Maybe not.

552
00:45:07,037 --> 00:45:11,235
I mean, it's the same duties,
practically, just less pay.

553
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:15,706
Same hours. Less responsibility.

554
00:45:15,879 --> 00:45:18,006
Same team, less pressure.

555
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:24,252
I tell you, Red, you know,
the cupboard is pretty bare.

556
00:45:24,421 --> 00:45:28,551
And I could use some recruiting help
from someone who knows the area.

557
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:38,458
You know, Carole and I
moved here two years ago. It was...

558
00:45:39,937 --> 00:45:41,905
...spring of '69.

559
00:45:44,208 --> 00:45:46,108
They had hired me as a receivers coach...

560
00:45:46,276 --> 00:45:50,076
...but when I got here, they told me
I was in charge of recruiting too, so...

561
00:45:50,981 --> 00:45:55,611
That first year I went out
and I got us 20 kids.

562
00:45:56,253 --> 00:46:00,917
Went to 20 homes.
Sat in 20 living rooms.

563
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:05,890
And I promised 20 mothers
that I'd look after their sons.

564
00:46:07,898 --> 00:46:10,423
It'd have been the class of '73.

565
00:46:14,638 --> 00:46:16,936
There's not one of them left.

566
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,071
So let me ask you, Jack:

567
00:46:24,481 --> 00:46:28,975
How am I supposed to look a mother in the
eye and promise her anything ever again?

568
00:46:35,292 --> 00:46:37,317
I don't know, Red.

569
00:46:45,335 --> 00:46:48,600
I just don't think I could
take that field again, Jack.

570
00:47:00,617 --> 00:47:04,053
Is that the Ohio Valley Coal line?

571
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:07,122
The same one that went off the tracks
near Akron last winter?

572
00:47:07,291 --> 00:47:10,317
Yep. That's the one.

573
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:13,095
Back on track.

574
00:47:18,502 --> 00:47:22,029
Well, listen,
if you're able to figure it out...

575
00:47:22,206 --> 00:47:24,970
...door's always open.
It was a pleasure meeting you, Red.

576
00:47:25,142 --> 00:47:27,110
Nice meeting you.

577
00:47:27,277 --> 00:47:31,145
I'll keep that defensive-nickel
package idea in mind...

578
00:47:31,315 --> 00:47:35,513
...for my fourth quarters in the future.
Maybe get a few more W's.

579
00:47:37,321 --> 00:47:38,913
One-by-six, huh?

580
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:40,317
Yup.

581
00:47:40,490 --> 00:47:43,857
Same coverage, less boards.

582
00:47:48,065 --> 00:47:49,396
Hey, Tom.

583
00:47:52,069 --> 00:47:54,094
Guess we got us a coach, huh?

584
00:48:03,347 --> 00:48:04,871
Hey, look.

585
00:48:06,283 --> 00:48:10,686
When they first roomed us together
freshman year, I wasn't too sure about you.

586
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:15,951
You know? But we stuck it out,
and now you're my best friend.

587
00:48:17,261 --> 00:48:19,627
I mean, remember freshman two-a-days?

588
00:48:19,796 --> 00:48:23,698
I'm puking my guts out and
I wanna quit football and you won't let me?

589
00:48:25,135 --> 00:48:27,729
Now, you never gave up on us
out there on the field...

590
00:48:27,905 --> 00:48:30,396
...and I'm not gonna give up on you now.

591
00:48:34,378 --> 00:48:36,039
Tom, man.

592
00:48:36,213 --> 00:48:41,947
It's our team. Now, they left this to us.
It's up to us! It's on our shoulders, man.

593
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:45,785
I need you with me, Tom.

594
00:48:45,956 --> 00:48:48,220
I should've been with them, Nate.

595
00:48:48,392 --> 00:48:52,590
- Look, Tom, I understand, and I feel...
- No, you don't! You don't, Nate! You don't.

596
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:57,162
What you talking about?

597
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,337
I overslept.

598
00:49:02,239 --> 00:49:05,265
That's why I wasn't on the plane, Nate.
I overslept.

599
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,810
I wasn't hurt or sick.
And I should've been there.

600
00:49:08,979 --> 00:49:11,004
I should have been with them!

601
00:49:12,783 --> 00:49:16,844
I'm sorry. I just can't play football
right now. Okay? It's not in me.

602
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:22,586
I can't do it, you understand that, right?
Look at me.

603
00:49:25,362 --> 00:49:26,989
I'm sorry.

604
00:49:27,364 --> 00:49:29,025
Tom.

605
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:49,316
Thought you might like some dessert.

606
00:49:50,787 --> 00:49:52,687
Thank you, Annie.

607
00:49:53,890 --> 00:49:55,551
I'm gonna get you some silverware.

608
00:50:57,821 --> 00:50:59,311
Yup.

609
00:51:00,290 --> 00:51:01,621
Game day.

610
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,297
Yup.

611
00:51:18,442 --> 00:51:23,607
So I'll give you one year.

612
00:51:26,183 --> 00:51:29,584
Well, if that's all the time we've got,
we'd better get started.

613
00:51:42,532 --> 00:51:44,090
Coach Mickey Jackson.

614
00:51:46,736 --> 00:51:48,533
Coach McNally.

615
00:51:52,075 --> 00:51:53,599
Coach Riley.

616
00:51:56,379 --> 00:52:02,113
First line: NCAA, address...
I assume you have it, Luann.

617
00:52:02,285 --> 00:52:04,412
It's somewhere in Kansas City.

618
00:52:04,588 --> 00:52:08,524
Salutation: To whom it may concern.

619
00:52:09,593 --> 00:52:12,790
As I am sure you are aware, we...

620
00:52:13,763 --> 00:52:16,231
I'm gonna take a road trip
southeast of here...

621
00:52:16,399 --> 00:52:19,926
...and go get this Shaw kid
down in Martinsville.

622
00:52:20,103 --> 00:52:22,094
I'm gonna take a shot at Gibbs.

623
00:52:22,272 --> 00:52:24,502
Go get us a quarterback, coach.

624
00:52:39,322 --> 00:52:42,291
- Jake. Red Dawson.
- Yes, sir?

625
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:53,700
I know coaches from quite a few schools
have already come to talk...

626
00:52:53,870 --> 00:52:57,829
...about your son playing football for them.
I hope that he hasn't made his mind up.

627
00:52:58,008 --> 00:52:59,839
Ain't no way he's made up his mind yet.

628
00:53:00,810 --> 00:53:03,005
Wait, there he is, right there.

629
00:53:14,357 --> 00:53:16,484
Oh, what's the good word, coach?

630
00:53:19,296 --> 00:53:21,321
No? Shit.

631
00:53:23,533 --> 00:53:26,366
Truman Andrews. Here we come.

632
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:52,393
Shit.

633
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:55,458
Luann?

634
00:53:59,135 --> 00:54:00,363
Sir?

635
00:54:00,537 --> 00:54:03,199
Has the NCAA returned
any of my calls yet?

636
00:54:03,373 --> 00:54:04,772
No.

637
00:54:07,277 --> 00:54:10,246
Six, seven, eight, nine, 10,
11 at West Virginia.

638
00:54:10,413 --> 00:54:14,873
Kids that we wanted who are now
in West Virginia. Who's that?

639
00:54:15,485 --> 00:54:17,817
Bob Lambert. West Virginia.

640
00:54:17,988 --> 00:54:19,478
Shit.

641
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:21,089
Twelve. West Virginia.

642
00:54:21,258 --> 00:54:24,421
Red, we gotta broaden our
recruiting base or something.

643
00:54:24,594 --> 00:54:27,927
We gotta get creative about...

644
00:54:28,198 --> 00:54:31,065
...who we're going after,
where we're going after them...

645
00:54:31,234 --> 00:54:34,431
...and how we're going after them.
Isn't that right, doc?

646
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:37,969
Good morning, Red.

647
00:54:39,409 --> 00:54:42,139
Well, how are we doing?

648
00:54:42,312 --> 00:54:44,337
West Virginia will be
competitive next year.

649
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:46,880
Yeah, very.
How about you?

650
00:54:47,751 --> 00:54:53,815
Well, Jack, I haven't heard anything
positive back yet.

651
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:56,481
And I think I've done everything I can.

652
00:54:56,793 --> 00:55:00,126
Maybe we need more time.
I don't know.

653
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:04,191
Time's the only thing
we don't have, Don.

654
00:55:04,367 --> 00:55:10,829
I mean, hell, it's already April.
Time is not our friend.

655
00:55:14,477 --> 00:55:16,945
Let me ask you a question.
Now, are you married?

656
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:18,876
Yes, I am. 25 years in May.

657
00:55:19,049 --> 00:55:22,280
Twenty-five years. I am willing to bet...

658
00:55:23,320 --> 00:55:26,585
...that you didn't propose over the phone.

659
00:55:29,125 --> 00:55:30,956
No, I didn't.

660
00:55:31,127 --> 00:55:36,793
Okay. And I know damn well
that she didn't say yes in a letter.

661
00:55:39,736 --> 00:55:41,328
- Jack?
- Doc?

662
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:44,940
- No, Jack. I know...
- Yes. Doc?

663
00:55:45,108 --> 00:55:46,336
You can do it.

664
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:50,503
You're an outlaw. Pioneer.

665
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:54,381
Gunslinger.
This is a whole new game, doc.

666
00:55:56,986 --> 00:55:58,977
You...

667
00:55:59,389 --> 00:56:01,016
You.

668
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:05,085
There's a first time for everything, Don.

669
00:56:06,596 --> 00:56:09,258
If we're gonna survive, this has
to be one of those times.

670
00:56:09,432 --> 00:56:11,900
And you're the only man that can do it.

671
00:56:22,846 --> 00:56:28,409
Excuse me, sir? Excuse me,
I'm sorry to bother you like this...

672
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:33,417
...but my name is Don Dedmon,
I'm president of Marshall University.

673
00:56:33,990 --> 00:56:36,220
May I speak with you
for a moment, please?

674
00:56:37,327 --> 00:56:39,659
What are you doing in Kansas City, Don?

675
00:56:40,296 --> 00:56:44,665
My town, my school, we're hurting.

676
00:56:45,135 --> 00:56:50,129
We want to play football,
and we cannot do it without your help.

677
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:56,536
Please.

678
00:57:16,433 --> 00:57:18,594
Guess who's going to change our diaper.

679
00:57:21,337 --> 00:57:24,431
Yeah!

680
00:57:24,607 --> 00:57:26,074
Get him!

681
00:57:26,242 --> 00:57:28,904
Need a little help here, Red.
He's heavier than you think.

682
00:57:29,078 --> 00:57:31,569
He's all wet.
He's all wet.

683
00:57:32,582 --> 00:57:34,072
Approved.

684
00:57:34,250 --> 00:57:38,243
"You will be allowed to play freshmen
at Marshall University."

685
00:57:38,421 --> 00:57:41,117
- What's that right there? What's that?
- Here, put me down.

686
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,590
That is signed by the president right there.
There he is. Stamped.

687
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:47,286
Doc, we're gonna get us a football team.

688
00:57:48,364 --> 00:57:51,128
And that is why we are offering
your son something...

689
00:57:51,301 --> 00:57:53,701
...that no other school in the country can.

690
00:57:53,970 --> 00:57:58,839
Immediate and substantial playing time
as a freshman.

691
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:16,990
Time! I like the kid
who made the lay-up.

692
00:58:17,160 --> 00:58:20,618
This is the one I wanna talk to, right here.
What's your name, son?

693
00:58:25,235 --> 00:58:27,226
Ball, ball, ball!

694
00:58:32,008 --> 00:58:33,908
- That was a hell of a hit.
- Thank you.

695
00:58:34,077 --> 00:58:36,477
- Coach Dawson, from the football club.
- Bobby Jordan.

696
00:58:36,646 --> 00:58:38,910
- Ever play any football? None at all?
- No, sir.

697
00:58:39,082 --> 00:58:42,108
- No Pop Warner, no high school?
- No. Just baseball.

698
00:58:46,923 --> 00:58:48,857
Groovy. Come on, man.

699
00:58:49,259 --> 00:58:50,692
Hey, let me rap to you.

700
00:58:59,769 --> 00:59:01,327
Hey, how you doing?

701
00:59:03,973 --> 00:59:06,771
Hey. What's up, man?

702
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:24,491
Strong finish.
That's a good-looking board.

703
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:29,697
Good-looking board.
I'm tired of flying.

704
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:37,305
Marshall Thundering Herd all-freshmen
team, led by quarterback John Cady...

705
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:43,776
...handing the ball off
to the ever-talented Lucas Booth!

706
00:59:43,947 --> 00:59:46,677
He runs to the inside,
and who's on the outsider wing?

707
00:59:46,849 --> 00:59:49,647
Terry Gardner catches it,
pitches to Tennis Rice...

708
00:59:49,819 --> 00:59:53,311
...who's going downfield to
tight end Sam Boteck.

709
01:00:19,749 --> 01:00:20,977
I've never been.

710
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:22,674
- Crazy. In four years?
- Yeah.

711
01:00:22,852 --> 01:00:24,217
- The bonfire.
- I've never been.

712
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:26,378
- Everyone's been to the bonfire.
- I haven't.

713
01:00:26,556 --> 01:00:28,888
- Do you eat marshmallows?
- I love marshmallows.

714
01:00:29,058 --> 01:00:32,824
- You've gotta come to the bonfire.
- Annie, order's up.

715
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:36,160
- Ask her to come.
- I will, I will.

716
01:00:40,536 --> 01:00:42,470
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

717
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:46,838
- Can we have some silverware?
- Sure.

718
01:00:52,482 --> 01:00:55,076
- Some guys have all the luck.
- Sorry?

719
01:00:55,251 --> 01:00:57,845
Your fiancé. He's a lucky guy.

720
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:03,824
- Can you drive? Yeah.
- Yeah. We'll leave about 8?

721
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:15,835
Keith? It's your turn
to set the table!

722
01:01:16,005 --> 01:01:17,734
He's not here, Mom.

723
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:20,572
- Where is he?
- I don't know.

724
01:01:22,412 --> 01:01:24,573
Okay, guys. First things first.

725
01:01:24,747 --> 01:01:26,977
Feel a connection to the guy next to you.

726
01:01:27,150 --> 01:01:30,119
Hand on a knee, hook an arm,
whatever it is.

727
01:01:30,520 --> 01:01:32,147
Come on, Herd.

728
01:01:32,321 --> 01:01:34,915
Look around, because these
are your teammates, young men.

729
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:38,083
They're made up of three
returning varsity members.

730
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:41,890
Randy Linden, George Olson, Nate Ruffin.

731
01:01:42,065 --> 01:01:46,058
Fifteen freshmen turning sophomores.

732
01:01:46,235 --> 01:01:48,829
And the rest of you, true freshmen...

733
01:01:49,005 --> 01:01:52,634
...very first time in college football
and walk-ons.

734
01:01:52,809 --> 01:01:55,175
Are you gonna play too, Tom?

735
01:01:56,379 --> 01:01:59,974
Remember, this is a game called football,
let's get to work. Let's go.

736
01:02:12,061 --> 01:02:14,461
We are going to be running
the Power I, gentlemen...

737
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:16,723
...which obviously starts
with a quarterback.

738
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:19,732
- Red, what are my choices?
- Dave Walsh.

739
01:02:19,902 --> 01:02:22,735
Solid athlete. Solid arm. Solid kid.

740
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:24,372
Okay.

741
01:02:25,108 --> 01:02:26,632
Who else?

742
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:31,405
- Jack, that's it.
- That's it, 10?

743
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:32,809
That's it, coach.

744
01:02:32,982 --> 01:02:35,212
All right, guys.
Competition breeds improvement.

745
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:39,081
Now, we need options here.
Let's look around, keep our eyes open.

746
01:02:39,255 --> 01:02:43,419
We need legs, hands and a decent arm.
Right there. Who's 86?

747
01:02:43,960 --> 01:02:47,259
That's Reggie Oliver.
Receiver from Alabama.

748
01:02:47,430 --> 01:02:50,228
Bear Bryant called me personally,
actually, to recommend him.

749
01:02:50,399 --> 01:02:53,664
- You wanna try him out at QB?
- Unless you think it's a bad idea.

750
01:02:54,036 --> 01:02:57,005
- Let's push them to the limit, men, huh?
- Right, coach.

751
01:03:03,579 --> 01:03:05,513
Come on, hit it, now!

752
01:03:07,116 --> 01:03:08,447
Check!

753
01:03:17,160 --> 01:03:18,286
Not good, coach.

754
01:03:33,309 --> 01:03:35,470
James, James. Get over here.

755
01:03:37,513 --> 01:03:39,174
That's supposed to be a post route.

756
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:41,111
- Post?
- Post.

757
01:03:41,284 --> 01:03:44,310
You do know the difference between a
post route and a flag route?

758
01:03:44,487 --> 01:03:45,715
No, coach.

759
01:03:45,888 --> 01:03:49,346
All right, all right.
You see the big goalpost there?

760
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:53,256
That's why they call it a post route. Post.
You head right to that post.

761
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:55,124
Cut 10 yards, to the post.

762
01:03:55,298 --> 01:03:57,766
See the big pylon down
at the corner of the end zone?

763
01:03:57,934 --> 01:03:59,697
That's what we call a flag, all right?

764
01:03:59,869 --> 01:04:01,734
So when you're running the flag route...

765
01:04:01,904 --> 01:04:04,429
...10 yards to the corner of the end zone,
to the flag.

766
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:06,438
- All right? All right.
- I got it.

767
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:08,304
Do it again.

768
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,255
Come on! Let's go!

769
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:24,453
Nice speed, Booth! Nice speed!

770
01:04:26,128 --> 01:04:28,596
Nice speed. Shalhoop. Hey.

771
01:04:28,764 --> 01:04:31,824
- What are you doing?
- Oh, I kick the ball, coach.

772
01:04:32,001 --> 01:04:34,799
But after you kick it, son,
you're still a football player.

773
01:04:41,377 --> 01:04:44,039
Good job, George. Good job, George.
Come here, come here.

774
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:46,078
- What's your name, 51?
- My name's Creole.

775
01:04:46,249 --> 01:04:48,274
Creole. This Redbook's
taking me only so far.

776
01:04:48,451 --> 01:04:52,478
Urbanek, I need names. Last names on
everyone's helmet. All right? This afternoon.

777
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:56,614
Now, Creole, the man outweighs you
by 75 pounds. Okay?

778
01:04:56,792 --> 01:04:58,384
When you're hitting him up high...

779
01:04:58,561 --> 01:05:01,587
...he'll beat you and you'll be
on your ass every time, all right?

780
01:05:01,764 --> 01:05:03,925
You gotta come in here,
you gotta get him low.

781
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:07,558
Get him in the legs, okay? That's how
you'll keep him from coming through.

782
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:10,535
- Stay low on him. Low, man.
- What should I do if he goes low?

783
01:05:10,706 --> 01:05:13,368
Good question. George says,
what does he do if he goes low?

784
01:05:13,542 --> 01:05:15,942
Five-one comes low.
Head slap and you're around him.

785
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:18,774
Like that. You see that?
Head-slap the shit out of him.

786
01:05:29,759 --> 01:05:33,820
- Give me second team, McNally.
- We don't have a second team, Jack.

787
01:05:33,996 --> 01:05:37,762
Shit. Okay, yeah, we do
have a second team. Jackson! Urbanek!

788
01:05:37,934 --> 01:05:39,925
Lengyel, McNally, Dawson...

789
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:42,263
...line up here.
Offensive line, watch this.

790
01:05:42,438 --> 01:05:45,635
- Coach, you don't have any pads on.
- Now, you just play ball, Olson.

791
01:05:47,777 --> 01:05:49,142
Quarterback's still standing.

792
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:51,439
Big on big.
We can run an offense.

793
01:05:51,614 --> 01:05:55,846
We can save a young man's life.
Come on, now. Power I. Big on big.

794
01:06:01,257 --> 01:06:04,192
We got a huge problem
on the O-line, coach.

795
01:06:05,227 --> 01:06:08,162
I don't think it's because
the defensive line is so spectacular.

796
01:06:08,331 --> 01:06:09,662
No. No.

797
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:15,797
Men. Power I. You know I'm a fan
of it, that's why I brought it here.

798
01:06:15,972 --> 01:06:18,805
I have learned in the last two weeks
that it is not working.

799
01:06:18,975 --> 01:06:22,570
So as of right now, the Power I
goes in the trash...

800
01:06:22,745 --> 01:06:27,079
...along with every flea-flicker,
double reverse...

801
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:30,241
...and every other trick play
that you may have in your playbook.

802
01:06:30,419 --> 01:06:33,820
Get rid of it.
Men, it is time to simplify. Ball.

803
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:37,323
So put our heads together here.

804
01:06:37,493 --> 01:06:39,654
What is the simplest offense...

805
01:06:41,731 --> 01:06:44,564
...that you have ever run
and actually won a football game?

806
01:06:44,734 --> 01:06:49,068
Any idea's a good idea. No right or wrong
in here today, men, let's talk it out.

807
01:06:49,238 --> 01:06:50,603
Well, there's always the Veer.

808
01:06:50,773 --> 01:06:54,641
The Veer. That's interesting.
Talk that out, Red.

809
01:06:55,244 --> 01:06:59,305
Well, the Veer's an option offense.
Spreads things out.

810
01:06:59,482 --> 01:07:01,074
Takes the focus off any one man.

811
01:07:01,250 --> 01:07:04,185
It's designed for teams that don't
have a strong offensive line.

812
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:08,111
Now, that is us in a nutshell.
Well, who runs it that we can talk to?

813
01:07:08,290 --> 01:07:10,690
Bill Yeoman came up with it
at Houston...

814
01:07:10,860 --> 01:07:14,193
...but other than West Virginia,
no one really runs it outside of Texas.

815
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:18,823
- West Virginia runs the Veer?
- Yeah.

816
01:07:24,073 --> 01:07:28,442
Jack, that's crazy. We're rivals.

817
01:07:28,611 --> 01:07:31,705
You think they'll invite us to lunch
and hand over their playbook?

818
01:07:31,881 --> 01:07:33,781
They don't have to take us out to lunch.

819
01:07:33,949 --> 01:07:36,008
We'll pick some up on the way.

820
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:40,685
Morgantown. The Veer. I like it.

821
01:07:45,027 --> 01:07:48,258
Eight-time Southern
Conference Champions, Red.

822
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:52,697
Jack? Jack, I gotta tell you,
I really don't think this is your best idea.

823
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:56,334
- Red! Good to see you again.
- Oh, coach.

824
01:07:56,505 --> 01:07:58,666
- How are you?
- How are you?

825
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:00,900
- And this must be?
- Coach Jack Lengyel.

826
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:03,477
Jack. Bobby Bowden.
Pleasure to meet you.

827
01:08:03,646 --> 01:08:05,273
It's a pleasure to meet you.

828
01:08:05,448 --> 01:08:07,814
Bobby, thank you for taking
the time with us today.

829
01:08:07,983 --> 01:08:10,349
- My pleasure, not a problem.
- All right.

830
01:08:10,519 --> 01:08:12,077
Yes, sir.

831
01:08:12,588 --> 01:08:15,955
So I can't wait to hear.
What can I do for you boys?

832
01:08:17,660 --> 01:08:19,525
Well, the thing is...

833
01:08:20,563 --> 01:08:21,996
...coach...

834
01:08:22,565 --> 01:08:26,501
...we're thinking about adopting
the Veer this year.

835
01:08:26,735 --> 01:08:29,795
Now, I understand that to be
your bread and butter, as it were.

836
01:08:29,972 --> 01:08:32,668
We're just hoping that we could
come down here and maybe...

837
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:34,810
...you could give us a few pointers.

838
01:08:41,851 --> 01:08:43,113
- Pointers?
- Tips.

839
01:08:43,285 --> 01:08:47,051
Advice. Anything that you'd
be willing to show us.

840
01:08:47,389 --> 01:08:52,588
Well, we'd really appreciate it. You seem
to be the man who runs it so well.

841
01:08:55,264 --> 01:08:56,595
He's good.

842
01:08:59,135 --> 01:09:01,626
- You're the best at the Veer.
- That's what they say!

843
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:03,738
I'm coming straight to the man.

844
01:09:08,410 --> 01:09:10,344
Reg, I got your burger.

845
01:09:10,513 --> 01:09:13,243
- Chili on the fries?
- They were out.

846
01:09:13,415 --> 01:09:17,408
Come on, Stretch. Gonna be a rough year
if that's the best you can do.

847
01:09:28,230 --> 01:09:29,822
What?
