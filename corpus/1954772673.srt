1
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:02,254
Fuck off.

2
00:02:35,288 --> 00:02:40,591
Oh. Oh, babe. Coffee.

3
00:02:43,997 --> 00:02:45,057
Molly?

4
00:03:02,182 --> 00:03:03,482
Molly, you see my ring?

5
00:03:12,825 --> 00:03:13,885
Molly?

6
00:03:20,300 --> 00:03:21,320
Ah, shit.

7
00:03:56,268 --> 00:03:59,736
- Teddy, turn around and get back in your truck.
- Look, can I just talk to Molly?

8
00:03:59,806 --> 00:04:02,573
Take one more step, and I'm going
inside, I'm getting my shotgun.

9
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:05,244
Angela, you're not gonna shoot me, OK?

10
00:04:05,246 --> 00:04:07,711
Let me just talk to Molly.
Gordon, would help me out here?

11
00:04:12,352 --> 00:04:15,086
Yeah, Teddy, I... I think you should probably go.

12
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,025
Really?

13
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,729
Well, look, I'm just gonna stand here.

14
00:04:23,731 --> 00:04:27,998
I'm not goin' away. I'm just gonna wait
'til Molly comes out, and I hope she does!

15
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:29,901
Stay away from my daughter!

16
00:04:31,771 --> 00:04:32,991
Hey.

17
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:41,912
- I'm sorry. I didn't know it was...
- Well, it was.

18
00:04:44,951 --> 00:04:47,651
- Molly.
- It's OK. Trust me. I'm alright.

19
00:04:47,721 --> 00:04:50,155
- Hey.
- Molly, don't you dare go with him!

20
00:05:03,569 --> 00:05:11,003
Oh, God. I'm so sorry. I don't... I...
I can't find my wedding ring.

21
00:05:11,045 --> 00:05:13,845
I'm not coming back to you.

22
00:05:13,847 --> 00:05:15,387
I'm just going home.

23
00:05:18,184 --> 00:05:21,284
OK. Alright.

24
00:05:22,866 --> 00:05:24,058
Alright.

25
00:05:41,074 --> 00:05:43,075
Guess you should get going.

26
00:05:43,077 --> 00:05:46,844
Guy does that to your only
sister, and that's your answer.

27
00:05:50,683 --> 00:05:53,884
I hope you're half as ashamed of you as I am.

28
00:06:21,714 --> 00:06:22,734
Hey.

29
00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,130
I'll clean this up.

30
00:06:45,104 --> 00:06:47,737
- Motherfucker.
- You said it, man.

31
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:49,273
- I was about to fuck him up.
- Yeah?

32
00:06:49,275 --> 00:06:52,810
I was about to get up in his face, and...
beat his ass.

33
00:06:52,812 --> 00:06:54,879
And I don't give a shit if it's her husband.

34
00:06:54,881 --> 00:06:57,715
I'm about two seconds from going
to his fucking house, right now.

35
00:06:57,717 --> 00:06:59,017
You want to?

36
00:06:59,019 --> 00:07:00,952
- What?
- I'm just throwing this out there,

37
00:07:00,955 --> 00:07:02,087
but if you want to do this for real,

38
00:07:02,489 --> 00:07:04,821
I might know a guy who knows a guy. You know?

39
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,695
- Shit, man. We gotta go back to work.
- Already?

40
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:14,498
Mm-hm. Let's go.

41
00:08:23,335 --> 00:08:24,395
Molly!

42
00:08:28,140 --> 00:08:29,941
Hey.

43
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:32,544
Sorry, I didn't think you were working today.

44
00:08:32,546 --> 00:08:34,713
Yeah, I just... I switched shifts.

45
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:37,916
Why, you... you didn't want to see me?

46
00:08:37,918 --> 00:08:40,919
I don't really want to see anyone.

47
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:43,522
I think that you should just come home.

48
00:08:43,524 --> 00:08:46,023
- Molly, please.
- I went home.

49
00:08:46,126 --> 00:08:48,693
Yeah, I know, but what if he...

50
00:08:54,500 --> 00:08:56,000
Here you go.

51
00:08:58,671 --> 00:09:01,191
Would it be alright if I talked to Gordon?

52
00:09:14,253 --> 00:09:15,654
Look, I know what you're thinking,

53
00:09:15,656 --> 00:09:18,823
and I... I got no defense, alright?

54
00:09:18,825 --> 00:09:20,725
I did a horrible thing, man.

55
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:24,095
But it's never gonna happen again.

56
00:09:24,097 --> 00:09:26,697
And I-I, I know it won't make up for anything,

57
00:09:26,699 --> 00:09:29,866
but I think, if you want, you've
got a right to take a swing at me.

58
00:09:37,476 --> 00:09:41,276
No. That's... no.

59
00:09:44,450 --> 00:09:47,217
OK. OK.

60
00:09:47,254 --> 00:09:52,990
Well, I... I think we should all get
a-get a bite soon, or something.

61
00:09:53,992 --> 00:09:56,596
I'm not gonna hide from this, or anything.

62
00:09:57,998 --> 00:09:59,158
Sure.

63
00:10:26,592 --> 00:10:29,027
Son of a bitch.

64
00:10:29,029 --> 00:10:32,063
- What?
- Motherfucker comes in here, to my workplace?

65
00:10:32,065 --> 00:10:33,398
- Who?
- Fucking Teddy.

66
00:10:33,400 --> 00:10:34,532
He's here?

67
00:10:34,534 --> 00:10:37,100
Yeah. He offered me a free shot.

68
00:10:37,137 --> 00:10:39,004
What, at your sister?

69
00:10:39,006 --> 00:10:41,339
On him, you idiot.

70
00:10:41,341 --> 00:10:43,475
So did you take it?

71
00:10:43,477 --> 00:10:45,409
What? No. No.

72
00:10:45,445 --> 00:10:47,211
Why not? What the fuck?

73
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:50,181
I can't... we're in public.

74
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,317
So what do you want to do?

75
00:10:52,319 --> 00:10:54,252
I want to fucking kill him.

76
00:10:57,089 --> 00:11:00,925
'Cause you know, as I said... I might have a guy.

77
00:11:00,927 --> 00:11:02,394
What do you mean, a guy?

78
00:11:02,396 --> 00:11:05,830
Like... a guy.

79
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,332
Mark, you don't have shit, man.

80
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:09,900
Because I go fishing with
this guy, who did some time.

81
00:11:09,902 --> 00:11:12,404
He had a cellmate he's always talking about.

82
00:11:12,406 --> 00:11:14,539
He's done this kind of thing before.

83
00:11:14,541 --> 00:11:17,174
Dude, just because you sell fucking dirt weed

84
00:11:17,176 --> 00:11:20,377
to high school kids doesn't mean
you're, you know, on the inside.

85
00:11:20,447 --> 00:11:22,447
You want me to check it out, or what?

86
00:11:25,351 --> 00:11:27,284
Yeah, fine. Whatever.

87
00:11:27,320 --> 00:11:29,688
I got work to do.

88
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,355
Like what?

89
00:11:42,101 --> 00:11:44,102
How was work?

90
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:46,671
It was fine.

91
00:11:46,673 --> 00:11:48,673
You gonna get paid for that overtime?

92
00:11:51,011 --> 00:11:57,681
I don't know. Every time I bring it up,
they just... I don't know. I'll see.

93
00:11:57,751 --> 00:11:59,884
Not so much, "we'll see." It's just, "no."

94
00:11:59,953 --> 00:12:01,986
- I-I wasn't done with it. I'm eating.
- Right?

95
00:12:02,055 --> 00:12:05,023
You know, when you let people
know that they can just

96
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:08,591
take from you and you don't do anything,
that's exactly what they'll do.

97
00:12:26,246 --> 00:12:30,515
- Hello?
- I got the number, man.

98
00:12:30,517 --> 00:12:33,183
Oh, um...

99
00:12:33,820 --> 00:12:35,386
<i>You backing out?</i>

100
00:12:37,924 --> 00:12:41,893
No. No, I just... I don't have that much money.

101
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:43,895
I thought you were saving for a truck?

102
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:49,734
Yeah, I got like, two grand.

103
00:12:49,736 --> 00:12:51,636
So you do got the money.

104
00:12:51,638 --> 00:12:53,871
<i>I got the number if you want it.</i>

105
00:12:57,443 --> 00:13:00,676
Yeah. Yeah, I want it.

106
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:02,280
<i>Come down to Henry's.</i>

107
00:13:20,167 --> 00:13:21,666
Hey, dude. What's up?

108
00:13:21,668 --> 00:13:23,134
I didn't get you nothing.

109
00:13:23,136 --> 00:13:24,135
Ah, that's OK.

110
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,157
Hey.

111
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:28,907
You sure this isn't bullshit?

112
00:13:28,909 --> 00:13:31,874
I called my man. He gave me the number.

113
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:34,479
And the money in my sock drawer's gonna be enough?

114
00:13:34,481 --> 00:13:35,647
You should ask him.

115
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:38,148
I'm gonna go get another pitcher. You want one?

116
00:13:38,218 --> 00:13:40,417
- Yeah, sure.
- You got five bucks?

117
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,020
Are you fucking kidding me?

118
00:13:42,022 --> 00:13:46,089
Motherfucker, I just did you a favor.
So, I'm gonna go get 'em. So, yeah.

119
00:13:46,159 --> 00:13:49,326
Fine. But, just... I can't spend any more.
Get the cheap shit.

120
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:45,416
Well, can't you just have Doris take my shift?

121
00:14:45,418 --> 00:14:48,017
Well, I got the flu. You want me around food?

122
00:14:49,788 --> 00:14:51,555
I never take off.

123
00:14:54,026 --> 00:14:55,859
OK. Sorry.

124
00:14:55,896 --> 00:14:58,296
I'll call you when I'm feeling better.

125
00:15:03,235 --> 00:15:06,237
Let me tell you what we're gonna do.

126
00:15:06,239 --> 00:15:09,205
Tonight you can crash on the couch. That's fine.

127
00:15:09,276 --> 00:15:11,776
Tomorrow you're gonna take
your stuff and move out.

128
00:15:11,778 --> 00:15:17,644
- Molly. Molly, I'm... please.
- Teddy, it's not even close to being a question.

129
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:24,188
Alright. Alright.

130
00:15:26,455 --> 00:15:27,547
Alright.

131
00:15:31,964 --> 00:15:39,771
What can I... Let me... let
me just take you to dinner.

132
00:15:39,773 --> 00:15:42,638
Just dinner. Please. Let me start over.

133
00:15:42,676 --> 00:15:44,842
Please, just dinner.

134
00:15:44,844 --> 00:15:48,980
And if... and if I do anything that... that you

135
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:56,421
don't want... anything at all... I'm gone.

136
00:15:56,423 --> 00:15:59,223
Um, I'll fucking move out of town.

137
00:15:59,225 --> 00:16:03,728
I will, I... you'll never...
you'll never see me again.

138
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:04,862
Please.

139
00:16:04,864 --> 00:16:07,197
Please, I'll do whatever you want. I'm serious.

140
00:16:07,233 --> 00:16:09,567
I'm serious.

141
00:16:09,569 --> 00:16:11,301
Please? Please.

142
00:16:14,273 --> 00:16:15,574
Fine.

143
00:16:16,076 --> 00:16:18,843
But this isn't some kind of fresh start.

144
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:21,812
You're not my husband again until I say so.

145
00:16:24,049 --> 00:16:26,916
That's fair. That's fair.

146
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:29,781
Yeah, it's fairer than you deserve.

147
00:16:57,649 --> 00:16:59,017
<i>Yeah?</i>

148
00:16:59,019 --> 00:17:01,819
Uh, is this-is this Howard?

149
00:17:01,821 --> 00:17:04,055
<i>Who's this?</i>

150
00:17:04,057 --> 00:17:08,089
My name is Gordon. Um, I'm calling about a job.

151
00:17:08,128 --> 00:17:09,994
<i>What time is it?</i>

152
00:17:09,996 --> 00:17:14,296
Uh... I don't know. About 1:30?

153
00:17:14,367 --> 00:17:17,568
<i>Yeah, you're calling me this late?</i>

154
00:17:17,570 --> 00:17:19,871
Uh, I got a contract.

155
00:17:19,873 --> 00:17:20,972
<i>What?</i>

156
00:17:20,974 --> 00:17:23,141
A con... a contract?

157
00:17:23,143 --> 00:17:26,710
Uh... to take care of someone?

158
00:17:28,413 --> 00:17:30,614
<i>How much money you got?</i>

159
00:17:32,684 --> 00:17:35,120
Uh, $2,000.

160
00:17:36,322 --> 00:17:39,524
<i>You want to talk, you come to my place.</i>

161
00:17:39,526 --> 00:17:41,059
OK, I'm in Auburn.

162
00:17:41,061 --> 00:17:44,326
- <i>Auburn?</i>
- Pennsylvania.

163
00:17:44,364 --> 00:17:50,198
<i>I live at the end of East Rio Street.
Jefferson County, Mississippi.</i>

164
00:17:51,103 --> 00:17:53,371
OK, well, I'll give you a call.

165
00:17:53,373 --> 00:17:56,739
<i>No you won't. You come, or don't.</i>

166
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,043
<i>End of East Rio Street.</i>

167
00:17:59,045 --> 00:18:01,713
<i>You pay expenses, too.</i>

168
00:18:02,715 --> 00:18:06,414
OK. Um... well, I...

169
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,871
So, I guess I'm going to Mississippi.

170
00:18:26,873 --> 00:18:30,206
- But... just to talk to him.
- He said he would do it?

171
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,576
- Fuck, yeah!
- Just to talk to him.

172
00:18:34,980 --> 00:18:36,247
You sure he's good?

173
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:37,982
I'm sure he's cheap.

174
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:19,423
You wanna grab a drink first?

175
00:19:19,425 --> 00:19:21,959
Dude, we just talked about this on the phone.

176
00:19:21,961 --> 00:19:24,061
I didn't know if you meant it.

177
00:19:24,063 --> 00:19:27,763
Look, I don't mean to be a dick, but
can we please just go to the motel?

178
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:05,494
Fuck! Fuck!

179
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:30,054
The store's sending you to Mississippi?

180
00:21:30,056 --> 00:21:33,655
Yes. For work. It's just for the weekend.
I'll be fine.

181
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:27,443
Hey, there. You ready to go?

182
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:31,280
- Sure.
- Alright.

183
00:22:31,284 --> 00:22:33,617
Where do you want to go?

184
00:22:33,619 --> 00:22:35,586
The Grill.

185
00:22:35,588 --> 00:22:37,988
We could go some place nicer.

186
00:22:37,990 --> 00:22:40,556
- I like the Grill.
- Alright.

187
00:22:40,593 --> 00:22:43,994
We're just gonna see people we know,
and, you know, it's not private, and...

188
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:46,831
Is that a problem, Teddy?

189
00:22:47,633 --> 00:22:48,666
No.

190
00:22:48,668 --> 00:22:55,407
No. I just thought... you know,
you might want to...

191
00:22:55,409 --> 00:22:57,369
The Grill it is.

192
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,580
- Hey, Teddy.
- Hey. Hey, Hank. How are ya?

193
00:23:04,784 --> 00:23:07,983
- I'm good.
- How are you guys?

194
00:23:07,987 --> 00:23:09,386
Good seeing you.

195
00:23:23,935 --> 00:23:25,769
-You know what you want?
- Yep.

196
00:23:33,678 --> 00:23:35,246
What can I get you guys?

197
00:23:35,248 --> 00:23:37,313
- Hi, Sally.
- Hey, Teddy.

198
00:23:37,350 --> 00:23:39,682
- Molly.
- Hey. How are the kids?

199
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:41,585
Oh, kids are great.

200
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:46,123
Y'all know what you're getting?

201
00:23:46,125 --> 00:23:48,425
Yeah, I'm gonna have the chicken
fried steak, and Molly will...

202
00:23:48,427 --> 00:23:51,395
I'll have the spaghetti, with
the, um... meat sauce.

203
00:23:54,901 --> 00:23:58,202
- Alright. Anything to drink?
- I'm gonna stick with water, for now.

204
00:23:58,204 --> 00:23:59,364
Water.

205
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:02,507
Yeah.

206
00:24:03,409 --> 00:24:05,142
Can you get me a beer?

207
00:24:08,313 --> 00:24:10,946
Alright. I can handle that. I'll be right back.

208
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:12,449
Alright. Thank you.

209
00:24:14,920 --> 00:24:19,254
Why'd you get the... the spaghetti?
They don't even do it like you like it.

210
00:24:19,291 --> 00:24:21,925
They don't have the parm... the... the cheese.

211
00:24:22,127 --> 00:24:24,927
I mean, if you want spaghetti, we
can go to a place that does that.

212
00:24:24,997 --> 00:24:27,596
I want the spaghetti here, alright?

213
00:24:28,601 --> 00:24:31,066
Alright. Yeah.

214
00:24:31,337 --> 00:24:32,836
Yeah. Sure.

215
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,911
You do anything fun today?

216
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:42,047
No.

217
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:44,482
Fair enough.

218
00:24:44,984 --> 00:24:46,124
Whatever.

219
00:24:58,263 --> 00:25:01,065
You're gonna be alright to get home?

220
00:25:01,067 --> 00:25:02,665
Yep. I'm good.

221
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:08,706
Well, maybe I could swing by, after work tomorrow?

222
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:14,707
Maybe bring something by the house, or... or we
could go out again, if... if... if you want.

223
00:25:14,780 --> 00:25:18,182
I got no problem with that.

224
00:25:18,184 --> 00:25:19,350
I'll cook something up.

225
00:25:19,352 --> 00:25:20,551
Is that alright?

226
00:25:20,553 --> 00:25:22,052
What'd I just say?

227
00:25:25,957 --> 00:25:28,517
I guess I'll see you tomorrow, then?

228
00:27:09,327 --> 00:27:11,295
<i>What you want?</i>

229
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:14,732
Uh, does Howard Blake live here?

230
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:17,468
<i>Who's that?</i>

231
00:27:17,470 --> 00:27:19,203
My name is Gordon.

232
00:27:19,205 --> 00:27:22,806
Do you know where I can find Howard Blake?

233
00:27:22,808 --> 00:27:23,841
<i>Come on in.</i>

234
00:27:33,652 --> 00:27:34,692
Come on in.

235
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:58,976
What you want?

236
00:27:58,978 --> 00:28:05,180
Uh... I... I just... we spoke the other day
on the phone about a... potential job?

237
00:28:05,184 --> 00:28:07,450
Why you come around here? I'm
ain't got no work for you.

238
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,087
No, it was... it was about me hiring...
you for a job in, uh, in Pennsylvania?

239
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:15,793
Oh!

240
00:28:16,595 --> 00:28:18,295
You're the man with the money.

241
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:22,301
Yeah.

242
00:28:23,903 --> 00:28:28,439
So... how do we... how do we go about doing this?

243
00:28:32,410 --> 00:28:34,112
Take your shirt off.

244
00:28:35,514 --> 00:28:38,546
- What's that?
- The shirt, take it off.

245
00:28:39,185 --> 00:28:41,485
Oh, no... I don't think you understand.

246
00:28:41,487 --> 00:28:43,586
- I... I'm not...
- No, you don't understand.

247
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:49,792
- Take your goddamn shirt off.
- Whoa, no, no, no.

248
00:28:49,895 --> 00:28:50,862
- OK.
- Take your shirt off!

249
00:28:50,864 --> 00:28:52,696
- Can you please just put that down?
- Take your goddamn

250
00:28:52,699 --> 00:28:54,119
- shirt off! - Alright!

251
00:28:56,501 --> 00:28:58,402
Shirt's coming off.

252
00:28:58,404 --> 00:29:00,037
It's off.

253
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:01,572
Pants.

254
00:29:01,574 --> 00:29:05,906
- No. Come on, please, sir.
- Now! Get them goddamn britches down!

255
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:13,083
Shorts!

256
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:16,052
- I don't think you...
- You don't need to think. Get your shorts down!

257
00:29:24,529 --> 00:29:26,530
- Hands up!
- Oh, come on!

258
00:29:26,532 --> 00:29:30,032
- I'm fixing to put you down with this, here.
- OK. OK. OK.

259
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:34,004
Turn around.

260
00:29:36,741 --> 00:29:38,175
Look, I have the money.

261
00:29:38,177 --> 00:29:40,410
And you'll still have it when we're done.

262
00:29:53,525 --> 00:29:54,958
You look clean.

263
00:29:54,960 --> 00:29:56,527
Put your shorts up.

264
00:30:02,700 --> 00:30:04,334
What the hell was that?

265
00:30:04,336 --> 00:30:07,504
Well, now we both know you ain't wearing a wire.

266
00:30:07,506 --> 00:30:09,706
Cops do that, you know?

267
00:30:09,708 --> 00:30:14,041
Well, you could have just said that and
made this whole thing a lot... easier.

268
00:30:14,079 --> 00:30:16,747
Yeah, well it seemed pretty easy from over here.

269
00:30:16,749 --> 00:30:18,448
Looked like you'd done it before.

270
00:30:18,450 --> 00:30:21,649
- No. No.
- Calm yourself.

271
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:27,056
Sit down. Take a seat.

272
00:30:31,830 --> 00:30:36,466
So, what is it you want me doing?

273
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:44,507
- Um... well, I got this brother in law.
- Yep.

274
00:30:44,543 --> 00:30:50,210
He's... he's a bad guy. I mean, really bad.
He... he beats up on my sister.

275
00:30:50,382 --> 00:30:53,815
- Yep.
- I mean, the other day he almost killed her.

276
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,055
So, what do you want me to do?

277
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:09,062
Well, I was wondering if... you know, you...
you could take care of him?

278
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:12,838
Oh.

279
00:31:14,340 --> 00:31:16,139
You want me to kill him.

280
00:31:20,144 --> 00:31:23,346
Yeah, well, I would like to
talk more about that, yeah.

281
00:31:26,918 --> 00:31:30,254
How much money you got on this, again?

282
00:31:30,256 --> 00:31:33,790
Um... $2,000. Back home.

283
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:40,264
Well... let's go get it.

284
00:31:40,266 --> 00:31:45,800
Well, yeah, I mean, maybe we can discuss
it a little more, if... if that's OK.

285
00:31:45,804 --> 00:31:46,837
Sure.

286
00:31:46,839 --> 00:31:48,305
We can talk about it in the car.

287
00:31:48,307 --> 00:31:50,774
Vallego is her girlfriend, and she says...

288
00:31:50,776 --> 00:31:52,809
she says, how did you know?

289
00:31:52,811 --> 00:31:56,712
All I did was drink iced tea all
night, and he didn't hit me once.

290
00:31:56,749 --> 00:31:59,149
And the girlfriend says, she says...

291
00:31:59,151 --> 00:32:02,719
says that that's what happens
when you keep your mouth shut.

292
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:03,781
Right?

293
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:12,462
You ain't thinking that's funny
'cause of your sister, I guess.

294
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:15,699
Well, some people got a sense of humor.

295
00:32:15,701 --> 00:32:21,867
Sorry. Uh... so how long you
been doing this kind of thing?

296
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:25,339
What, the... the killing thing?

297
00:32:25,377 --> 00:32:27,911
Well... a while.

298
00:32:27,913 --> 00:32:32,582
But... it ain't exactly full time, you know?

299
00:32:32,584 --> 00:32:35,962
It's hard telling how many
fellas want a man dead enough

300
00:32:35,981 --> 00:32:39,003
to pay for it, but not enough to do it theyselves.

301
00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:42,225
And you've done this... you've done
this kind of thing before, right?

302
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:46,161
- For... for money?
- Oh, sure.

303
00:32:46,532 --> 00:32:51,668
So, how do we... how do you go about it?

304
00:32:51,670 --> 00:32:56,139
Well, you... you give me your
money, I shoot him in his head.

305
00:32:56,141 --> 00:32:58,341
Ain't like I'm teaching Portuguese, or anything.

306
00:32:58,343 --> 00:33:03,812
No, I just, mean, well, you know, why do..
most people want to do something like this?

307
00:33:03,849 --> 00:33:07,715
Jesus Christ. You keep nipping at my
heels, you're gonna buy me dinner.

308
00:33:09,133 --> 00:33:11,633
Uh... OK.

309
00:33:11,723 --> 00:33:16,957
Those motel walls were so thin, all
I was hearing for a week was...

310
00:33:18,664 --> 00:33:22,763
And he's about to bust his nut, so he's like...
You know how that is?

311
00:33:22,835 --> 00:33:24,468
Oh, yeah, baby.

312
00:33:24,470 --> 00:33:28,036
For a week, man. I'm telling
you, it drove me crazy.

313
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:33,041
These burgers are fucking fantastic, man.
I'm... I'm impressed.

314
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:36,581
Mm.

315
00:33:38,083 --> 00:33:40,250
So what do you like to do in Mississippi?

316
00:33:40,252 --> 00:33:45,022
Well, I keep myself company just fine.

317
00:33:45,024 --> 00:33:48,225
Are you from there?

318
00:33:48,227 --> 00:33:50,627
Mm-mm.

319
00:33:50,629 --> 00:33:51,729
Mm.

320
00:33:52,631 --> 00:33:56,564
- Born in Utah. Come out here about...
- He's a terrible man.

321
00:33:56,702 --> 00:34:02,069
- You said that.
- I wish I could just do it myself.

322
00:34:02,142 --> 00:34:05,676
- Yeah.
- I mean, that's moral, right?

323
00:34:05,778 --> 00:34:09,746
If it saves my sister, and... and
he goes off somewhere better?

324
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:11,048
Refill?

325
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:13,216
- Sure.
- And the check, please.

326
00:34:13,218 --> 00:34:15,138
Get that right for you, Hank.

327
00:34:18,056 --> 00:34:22,490
How do you square yourself off
with God with something like this?

328
00:34:22,561 --> 00:34:25,128
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

329
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:28,198
Son, if you hadn't figured out that this stuff was

330
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:32,235
bullshit by the time you'd reached
puberty, I got nothing for you.

331
00:34:32,237 --> 00:34:34,037
You don't believe in God?

332
00:34:34,039 --> 00:34:38,605
Well, what the fuck are you saying?
We just... die, and that's it?

333
00:34:38,677 --> 00:34:40,177
I couldn't live like that.

334
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:44,112
Yeah, that's great, but it just exists
in your head. Ain't none of my business.

335
00:34:44,950 --> 00:34:49,151
I mean, I got my thoughts, and you have
yours, you know? Who knows, right? So...

336
00:34:49,188 --> 00:34:53,323
I just... I just want my sister to be happy.

337
00:34:53,325 --> 00:34:55,358
Well, whether it's your religion or your sister,

338
00:34:55,360 --> 00:34:57,461
you tell me what you hold close, and I'll

339
00:34:57,463 --> 00:35:00,063
tell you where you're lying to yourself.

340
00:35:00,065 --> 00:35:03,700
You be careful, boy.

341
00:35:03,702 --> 00:35:05,035
What are you looking at?

342
00:35:05,037 --> 00:35:06,935
- What?
- Not you.

343
00:35:08,806 --> 00:35:11,274
You've been looking over here
for the past five minutes.

344
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:12,609
You want to tell me why?

345
00:35:12,611 --> 00:35:15,045
I don't like the way you talk about religion.

346
00:35:15,047 --> 00:35:19,015
Maybe you want to shut up.

347
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:22,419
I don't give a good God damn what you like.

348
00:35:22,421 --> 00:35:26,087
You better put those eyes back in that soup
boy, or you ain't gonna have much use for 'em.

349
00:35:26,091 --> 00:35:28,011
I'll look wherever I want to look.

350
00:35:31,896 --> 00:35:32,897
Yep.

351
00:35:33,699 --> 00:35:35,339
I guess you're gonna.

352
00:35:39,070 --> 00:35:42,897
Look, maybe... I made a big
mistake with this, whole...

353
00:35:42,916 --> 00:35:43,991
What?

354
00:35:44,076 --> 00:35:46,342
- Maybe I can just drive you back home, and...
- What, cause of that?

355
00:35:46,378 --> 00:35:48,145
No, I'm just, you know, thinking...

356
00:35:48,147 --> 00:35:50,388
Why don't you go outside and bring the car around?

357
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:55,951
- We gotta wait for...
- No, I-I'll take care of that.

358
00:35:55,988 --> 00:35:58,587
She'll bring it, we'll square it up later.
You go and get the car.

359
00:35:58,624 --> 00:36:01,026
- You ain't comin'?
- Meet you outside.

360
00:36:02,628 --> 00:36:05,027
Oh. OK.

361
00:36:30,923 --> 00:36:33,823
Get in the car.

362
00:36:33,825 --> 00:36:35,458
I didn't see you come out.

363
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,466
I got kids.

364
00:36:45,170 --> 00:36:46,336
Oh, shit.

365
00:36:48,973 --> 00:36:52,006
Hey. Hey! Look at me!

366
00:36:52,110 --> 00:36:53,243
Get in the car.

367
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:01,017
No, no, no, no.

368
00:37:01,019 --> 00:37:02,918
No, no. Hey!

369
00:37:03,021 --> 00:37:04,020
Come here!

370
00:37:04,022 --> 00:37:05,488
You get in the car.

371
00:37:05,490 --> 00:37:08,223
You wanna talk about this, we'll
talk about it later. Get in the car!

372
00:37:38,389 --> 00:37:41,358
Hey, you look... you look great.

373
00:37:41,360 --> 00:37:43,827
I got... I got you these.

374
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:45,295
Thanks.

375
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:46,898
Come in.

376
00:38:26,604 --> 00:38:28,271
Tastes good.

377
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:30,308
You've had it before.

378
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:32,742
Yeah, I know-I know.

379
00:38:32,744 --> 00:38:37,514
I was just... tastes like you
did something different.

380
00:38:37,716 --> 00:38:39,096
Little bit.

381
00:38:42,420 --> 00:38:45,123
Well... what'd you do?

382
00:38:46,525 --> 00:38:48,859
It's just a new recipe.

383
00:38:49,661 --> 00:38:50,862
Oh.

384
00:38:52,064 --> 00:38:57,134
Well, yeah, it's... it's interesting.

385
00:38:58,236 --> 00:38:59,437
Thanks.

386
00:39:05,443 --> 00:39:08,146
Was it a recipe with poison in it?

387
00:39:09,648 --> 00:39:12,349
I mean, it's like... really, really bad.

388
00:39:12,351 --> 00:39:13,750
It's not good.

389
00:39:13,952 --> 00:39:16,551
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. No, you tried.

390
00:39:16,655 --> 00:39:19,022
It's just... wow! Uh...

391
00:39:19,024 --> 00:39:21,057
- Don't you work in a restaurant?
- OK.

392
00:39:21,059 --> 00:39:23,093
Now you don't get to finish.

393
00:39:23,095 --> 00:39:26,327
No. No-no-no. Wait, wait. I'm-I'm eating.
I'm eating.

394
00:39:26,331 --> 00:39:28,098
No. Now I'm embarrassed.

395
00:39:28,100 --> 00:39:29,199
Never cooking again.

396
00:39:29,201 --> 00:39:31,234
That might be smart.

397
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:33,768
- OK. Now you're done.
- Wait.

398
00:39:36,307 --> 00:39:38,541
It's alright.

399
00:39:38,543 --> 00:39:39,943
I'm not gonna hurt you.

400
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:41,146
I know.

401
00:39:46,484 --> 00:39:51,055
I don't... remember the other night.

402
00:39:51,857 --> 00:39:53,156
You know that, right?

403
00:39:53,158 --> 00:39:55,691
- I'm not saying that makes it OK.
- It doesn't.

404
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,964
But it wasn't me.

405
00:40:00,966 --> 00:40:04,000
Do you know what I mean?

406
00:40:04,002 --> 00:40:05,534
Yes, it was.

407
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,208
So don't forget that.

408
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,343
Wait. Wait.

409
00:40:13,945 --> 00:40:15,266
I can do that.

410
00:40:18,315 --> 00:40:19,375
Sure.

411
00:40:34,365 --> 00:40:38,666
So you got any chores that need doing?
Can I swing by tomorrow?

412
00:40:38,703 --> 00:40:40,604
I'll think of something.

413
00:40:41,606 --> 00:40:42,666
Great.

414
00:40:45,242 --> 00:40:46,262
Hey.

415
00:40:46,412 --> 00:40:48,745
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't
mean to make you nervous.

416
00:40:49,214 --> 00:40:50,979
It's not that. It...

417
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:55,983
- Well, what? What?
- It just hurts.

418
00:41:07,496 --> 00:41:10,834
What are you... what are you... what are you...

419
00:41:10,836 --> 00:41:13,636
what are you doing with someone like me?

420
00:41:13,638 --> 00:41:15,938
- Have you lost your mind?
- What are you saying?

421
00:41:15,941 --> 00:41:20,210
Holy shit! I... if I saw that on
anyone else, I'd tell them to leave.

422
00:41:20,212 --> 00:41:21,778
So what, you're gonna leave me?

423
00:41:21,780 --> 00:41:23,379
Uh, no, no! Don't... That's not...
that's not what...

424
00:41:23,381 --> 00:41:25,214
Yeah. 'Cause you signed on for this.

425
00:41:25,284 --> 00:41:27,449
You don't get to make that decision.
I already left you.

426
00:41:27,786 --> 00:41:29,519
- Molly!
- No. I...

427
00:41:30,721 --> 00:41:35,225
I love you so much, and you did this to me.

428
00:41:35,227 --> 00:41:38,925
- I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
- No. You... you wanted to fix this.

429
00:41:39,831 --> 00:41:41,931
So you're gonna go home to wherever the hell

430
00:41:41,933 --> 00:41:44,400
you're staying... and you're gonna come back

431
00:41:44,402 --> 00:41:46,936
here tomorrow and make it up to me.

432
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:50,305
And you're gonna do that the next day,
and every day after that, and forever.

433
00:41:50,375 --> 00:41:51,456
OK?

434
00:41:53,911 --> 00:41:54,971
Yeah.

435
00:42:00,150 --> 00:42:03,551
Just go home. I'll see you tomorrow.

436
00:42:28,879 --> 00:42:31,181
Want to listen to the radio?

437
00:42:32,083 --> 00:42:35,383
No. I think I'll just... I
kind of want to just get home.

438
00:42:35,420 --> 00:42:38,020
Well, that's where we are going.

439
00:42:41,792 --> 00:42:45,627
- Look, we never really agreed to a...
- I'm not leaving my house in

440
00:42:45,664 --> 00:42:47,396
the middle of the night for nothing.

441
00:42:49,166 --> 00:42:52,835
Well, I think I said I kind of
want to just... talk about it.

442
00:42:52,837 --> 00:42:56,904
We were talking about how, not if.
You'd best understand that.

443
00:43:01,345 --> 00:43:03,713
They don't know what we're driving.

444
00:43:03,915 --> 00:43:07,648
And when they find them bodies, they
ain't gonna piece anything together.

445
00:43:07,719 --> 00:43:12,655
They'll just be running around
like retards at the rodeo.

446
00:43:12,657 --> 00:43:18,959
Yeah, um... do you think that maybe we could...
you know, stay at a motel for the night?

447
00:43:19,197 --> 00:43:21,197
I can drive 'til daybreak.

448
00:43:21,399 --> 00:43:24,319
Yeah, well, I kind of want to crash in a bed.

449
00:43:26,303 --> 00:43:30,006
Well, I guess every man
ain't cut out for the road.

450
00:43:40,050 --> 00:43:43,117
Alright. I'm gonna crash out.

451
00:43:43,588 --> 00:43:46,156
Yeah, you had yourself quite a night.

452
00:43:46,558 --> 00:43:49,578
- Get yourself some sleep, there.
- Yep.

453
00:43:52,363 --> 00:43:54,131
Take a shower.

454
00:43:54,633 --> 00:43:57,073
Wash that shit off the top of your lip.

455
00:43:59,536 --> 00:44:01,904
What time do you want to hit
the road in the morning?

456
00:44:03,975 --> 00:44:05,343
About 10:00.

457
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:08,311
10:00 it is.

458
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:13,548
Alright. I'll see ya then.

459
00:44:18,424 --> 00:44:20,758
- What?
- I'm gonna need that phone.

460
00:44:22,360 --> 00:44:24,761
Well, I don't think you can just...

461
00:44:24,763 --> 00:44:28,730
You gonna give it to me, or you gonna make
me come over and get it? Come on, now.

462
00:44:36,874 --> 00:44:37,907
Your cell, too.

463
00:44:40,477 --> 00:44:44,545
- It doesn't even get reception here.
- Well, lucky you. You won't even miss it.

464
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,966
Get you some sleep.

465
00:45:10,474 --> 00:45:14,941
Try not to keep yourself up thinking about
all the people done screwed on that bed.

466
00:45:58,422 --> 00:46:00,089
Enjoying the evening?

467
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:03,861
Can't sleep.

468
00:46:05,563 --> 00:46:08,532
Wanna go curb crawling, or something?

469
00:46:09,034 --> 00:46:10,533
No. I don't.

470
00:46:13,203 --> 00:46:14,803
Then go back to sleep.

471
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:31,853
10:00 AM. Time to get up.

472
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:37,893
- What?
- It's 10:00.

473
00:46:37,929 --> 00:46:39,564
Time to hit the road.

474
00:46:40,766 --> 00:46:45,565
- OK. Alright.
- Gordon.

475
00:46:45,904 --> 00:46:47,337
What?

476
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:52,108
I've spent my whole life hand
holding people like you.

477
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:57,980
But you... you don't know me at
all, and tha... that's fine.

478
00:46:57,982 --> 00:46:59,649
Hell, I might even take comfort in that,

479
00:46:59,651 --> 00:47:04,253
but you best keep that in mind
before you do something stupid.

480
00:47:04,255 --> 00:47:09,790
Now... we're gonna go to your
house and do what you need done.

481
00:47:10,061 --> 00:47:12,929
Or you could just pay me the
money, and I'll be on my way.

482
00:47:12,931 --> 00:47:16,032
Either way, I don't care.

483
00:47:16,034 --> 00:47:21,735
But... you're never gonna be a man in your
own mind unless this thing is finished.

484
00:47:21,739 --> 00:47:24,974
And you ain't doing it yourself.

485
00:47:24,976 --> 00:47:28,744
Now, it sounds like she ain't leaving him.

486
00:47:28,746 --> 00:47:31,614
And he sure ain't leaving her.

487
00:47:31,716 --> 00:47:33,651
So it's up to you.

488
00:47:34,953 --> 00:47:37,520
All you got in your life is choices.

489
00:47:37,922 --> 00:47:39,555
What's yours gonna be?

490
00:47:45,262 --> 00:47:46,798
I want him dead.

491
00:47:48,800 --> 00:47:50,167
Alright.

492
00:47:51,369 --> 00:47:53,835
Get yourself dressed. See you in the car.

493
00:47:56,240 --> 00:47:57,320
Hey, Howard?

494
00:47:59,142 --> 00:48:05,111
Can you, uh, just do me a favor, and...
not kill anyone else until we get there?

495
00:48:06,117 --> 00:48:10,084
Gordon, I don't think that's a
promise I could comfortably keep.

496
00:48:10,088 --> 00:48:12,056
Especially if you keep running your mouth.

497
00:48:13,758 --> 00:48:15,458
See you outside in five.

498
00:48:40,617 --> 00:48:42,717
- Hey.
- Hey.

499
00:48:54,031 --> 00:48:55,633
Auburn, you say?

500
00:48:57,235 --> 00:48:58,269
Yep.

501
00:48:59,671 --> 00:49:02,205
That's pretty much Penntucky, isn't it?

502
00:49:03,007 --> 00:49:04,841
How cold it get up there?

503
00:49:05,243 --> 00:49:07,142
I don't know. Pretty cold, I guess.

504
00:49:07,145 --> 00:49:10,013
Goddamn, that's gonna do my
joints in something awful.

505
00:49:10,415 --> 00:49:13,582
So what's... what's the plan for
keeping this whole thing quiet?

506
00:49:13,584 --> 00:49:15,284
What's the worry, kid?

507
00:49:15,586 --> 00:49:18,586
I don't know what would happen
if, you know, you got arrested?

508
00:49:18,656 --> 00:49:21,357
Why would I get arrested?

509
00:49:21,759 --> 00:49:23,192
I don't know. You've been caught before, right?

510
00:49:23,261 --> 00:49:24,894
Jesus Christ, you wanna see
my resume, or something?

511
00:49:24,896 --> 00:49:27,396
No. I just know you went to
prison before, so I-I just...

512
00:49:27,399 --> 00:49:30,298
Too chicken shit to do it yourself. How 'bout this?

513
00:49:31,102 --> 00:49:32,668
I want you money, so I'm gonna warn you.

514
00:49:32,670 --> 00:49:35,739
You keep talking like this,
I'll shoot you in the mouth.

515
00:49:36,941 --> 00:49:38,175
OK, I'm sorry.

516
00:49:38,177 --> 00:49:41,642
If you knew how much I felt like putting
you down right now, you'd keep it shut.

517
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:08,269
I'm gonna get a lemonade. You want one?

518
00:50:08,706 --> 00:50:11,306
- A lemonade?
- Yeah.

519
00:50:11,843 --> 00:50:13,076
No, Teddy.

520
00:50:13,078 --> 00:50:15,711
I know you've got the wife
thing and all, but I'm not 12.

521
00:50:15,713 --> 00:50:17,814
I don't want a lemonade.

522
00:50:18,616 --> 00:50:21,115
Alright. Well, I'm gonna have one.

523
00:50:22,553 --> 00:50:25,522
Well, hey, can you throw my beers in the fridge?

524
00:50:26,124 --> 00:50:28,357
You're really gonna make me go inside with those?

525
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:30,479
You gonna want help with the rest of this?

526
00:50:35,166 --> 00:50:36,732
Fuck you, man.

527
00:50:43,573 --> 00:50:44,733
They're not mine.

528
00:51:15,606 --> 00:51:18,907
- Do you... do you mind if I...?
- Mm-mm.

529
00:51:19,177 --> 00:51:22,977
- Well, I think you've still got it.
- Oh.

530
00:51:24,349 --> 00:51:25,450
Thanks.

531
00:51:27,351 --> 00:51:28,618
Hello?

532
00:51:28,620 --> 00:51:30,086
<i>Where the hell are you?</i>

533
00:51:30,088 --> 00:51:33,254
<i>We have dinner with your sister and the
son of a bitch. You gonna make it back?</i>

534
00:51:33,258 --> 00:51:34,757
Yeah. Yeah, I'll be home tomorrow.

535
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,493
<i>Yeah? How's the job?</i>

536
00:51:37,495 --> 00:51:40,328
Uh, it-it's... it is good. You know? It...

537
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:44,500
- just fine.
- <i>Gordon, I hate when you lie to me.</i>

538
00:51:44,502 --> 00:51:47,002
<i>It makes me think you did
something you know was stupid.</i>

539
00:51:47,004 --> 00:51:53,071
Mom, I'm not lying, OK? I just... I'm... I
can't talk right now. I'm... I'm driving.

540
00:51:53,077 --> 00:51:55,810
<i>Fine. When we get home, we're gonna...</i>

541
00:51:56,080 --> 00:51:58,581
Lying to your mother?

542
00:51:58,583 --> 00:52:00,049
Sinner.

543
00:52:00,651 --> 00:52:05,553
Look, I know you said the whole th...
thing about the mouth shooting.

544
00:52:05,955 --> 00:52:08,089
- But...
- Doesn't sound like it.

545
00:52:08,126 --> 00:52:11,927
Well, I'm... I'm just kinda hungry.

546
00:52:17,602 --> 00:52:19,001
Wait. Where we going?

547
00:52:19,004 --> 00:52:21,403
You wanna get something to eat,
we can get something to eat.

548
00:52:21,540 --> 00:52:24,140
Well, how do you know there's
gonna be food around here?

549
00:52:24,142 --> 00:52:25,274
Saw a sign.

550
00:52:25,476 --> 00:52:29,445
Well, I didn't... I didn't see any...
I didn't see a sign.

551
00:52:29,447 --> 00:52:31,379
- Well, it was there.
- Look, I'm sorry. I'll...

552
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:34,150
I'll shut up, I'll... can
we just please keep going?

553
00:52:34,152 --> 00:52:35,618
No, we're gonna get you something to eat.

554
00:52:35,620 --> 00:52:37,920
Alright, I have the money
waiting at my house for you.

555
00:52:38,022 --> 00:52:39,122
- I know.
- OK, so

556
00:52:39,124 --> 00:52:40,823
can we please just keep going
and get on the highway?

557
00:52:41,025 --> 00:52:42,558
I didn't... I didn't see any signs.

558
00:52:42,560 --> 00:52:46,028
Gordon, I don't need to lie to you to kill you.

559
00:52:46,030 --> 00:52:48,331
We're gonna get you something to eat.

560
00:52:48,333 --> 00:52:49,733
What?

561
00:52:50,935 --> 00:52:52,702
Are you afraid?

562
00:52:53,704 --> 00:52:55,305
You afraid?

563
00:52:56,507 --> 00:52:57,874
No worrying.

564
00:52:58,176 --> 00:53:02,575
I'm not gonna kill you. I'll just blow
your kneecaps off. How about that?

565
00:53:02,647 --> 00:53:04,712
- No-no-no-no-no. No-no.
- You need those things, huh?

566
00:53:04,783 --> 00:53:06,623
Do you need those things... huh?

567
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:10,286
Calm down.

568
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:15,291
I'm not gonna shoot you.

569
00:53:15,293 --> 00:53:17,792
- OK, I'm gonna shoot you.
- No-no. No! Fuck!

570
00:53:17,962 --> 00:53:20,828
Hey! Just kidding. Just kidding.

571
00:53:20,865 --> 00:53:22,632
Relax, man.

572
00:53:23,234 --> 00:53:25,101
Why would I kill you?

573
00:53:25,103 --> 00:53:26,269
Why?

574
00:53:26,871 --> 00:53:28,906
You ain't paid me yet.

575
00:53:30,808 --> 00:53:32,907
Oh, fuck it. I'm just gonna do it.

576
00:53:32,944 --> 00:53:34,044
Ow!

577
00:53:34,946 --> 00:53:36,512
I'm just kidding.

578
00:53:36,914 --> 00:53:38,481
You relaxed now?

579
00:53:38,983 --> 00:53:40,916
You relaxed, motherfucker!?

580
00:53:43,820 --> 00:53:45,986
Oh! Hey.

581
00:53:46,424 --> 00:53:48,224
Gonna get you something to eat.

582
00:54:17,220 --> 00:54:18,380
You ain't hungry?

583
00:54:20,724 --> 00:54:21,925
I don't know.

584
00:54:22,827 --> 00:54:24,094
You don't know?

585
00:54:25,096 --> 00:54:26,829
Go on, get something to eat.

586
00:54:27,231 --> 00:54:29,864
That's why we stopped. So you
could get something to eat.

587
00:54:31,501 --> 00:54:34,468
- Yeah.
- Is there something you want to tell me?

588
00:54:35,072 --> 00:54:36,939
No, I'm... I'm fine.

589
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,877
You can't take a joke, can you?

590
00:54:44,180 --> 00:54:45,515
I'm fine.

591
00:54:46,117 --> 00:54:47,650
God damn.

592
00:54:47,652 --> 00:54:53,652
Am I just gonna get that baby face for...
I was messing with you.

593
00:54:53,925 --> 00:54:55,824
Don't turn into some bitch.

594
00:54:55,826 --> 00:54:59,325
OK. I'm sorry... I'm... I'm
just freaking out a little bit.

595
00:54:59,330 --> 00:55:02,263
- I just wanted to talk about...
- What?

596
00:55:02,333 --> 00:55:05,799
The whole thing. The... I don't know.

597
00:55:09,173 --> 00:55:10,807
I don't know.

598
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:15,576
You want me to tell you about my killing.
Don't you?

599
00:55:15,613 --> 00:55:19,081
You been wanting me to tell you
about that since we met, ain't you?

600
00:55:19,083 --> 00:55:24,751
You don't... you don't have to
talk about it, if you don't want.

601
00:55:24,922 --> 00:55:26,622
No, that's alright.

602
00:55:26,924 --> 00:55:29,090
It's OK. Uh... it's fine.

603
00:55:32,863 --> 00:55:41,263
OK, look you... uh... when I was a kid, I
had this golden retriever, named Misty.

604
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:43,973
I mean, that dog was dumb.

605
00:55:44,175 --> 00:55:47,176
It would bark at the wind if it heard it.

606
00:55:47,178 --> 00:55:49,479
Ah, but she was nice enough.

607
00:55:49,681 --> 00:55:51,281
You know?

608
00:55:52,383 --> 00:55:55,282
It was the winter. It was... I think I was 12.

609
00:55:55,519 --> 00:55:58,886
Someone left some food outside, and a
mountain lion came sniffing around.

610
00:55:58,923 --> 00:56:00,256
And bam, out goes Misty.

611
00:56:00,258 --> 00:56:04,791
And that mountain lion pounced on that dog and
snapped her neck. I mean, just like that.

612
00:56:05,396 --> 00:56:08,597
Out comes my old man, .38 in hand.

613
00:56:08,599 --> 00:56:11,998
Fires the gun. Boom! Bullet
hits the lion in the ass.

614
00:56:12,236 --> 00:56:15,304
It-it... it jumps up, honest to
God, about 8 feet in the air,

615
00:56:15,306 --> 00:56:17,373
does a double back flip, lands on all fours,

616
00:56:17,575 --> 00:56:21,742
and it is gone into the woods,
just like that. I mean a pyow!

617
00:56:21,779 --> 00:56:28,514
I mean... it... next morning, I come out with
my .22 and I'm gonna finish it off, you know?

618
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:35,188
I look around, not too far, about a couple hundred
yards beyond the road in front of our house.

619
00:56:35,393 --> 00:56:36,659
Lion's there.

620
00:56:37,461 --> 00:56:38,561
Dead.

621
00:56:39,163 --> 00:56:43,533
And it's, uh, its cub is trying
to suckle at it, you know?

622
00:56:43,635 --> 00:56:45,368
Get the last bit of milk.

623
00:56:46,470 --> 00:56:53,139
I come up to close to it, and... it stops, and
kind of looks up at me, with these desperate eyes.

624
00:56:53,978 --> 00:56:58,847
And I shoulda kilt it then, but...
because of my dog,

625
00:56:58,849 --> 00:57:02,118
I thought, well, hell, I'll just let it suffer.

626
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:03,500
Let it starve.

627
00:57:05,455 --> 00:57:11,290
But then I'm walking home, and I'm
thinking, well, Misty didn't suffer.

628
00:57:11,596 --> 00:57:15,163
She's here, and then she's gone, and
the mountain lion didn't suffer.

629
00:57:15,466 --> 00:57:17,599
A couple hours of pain, and died.

630
00:57:17,601 --> 00:57:21,303
But me and the cub, we suffered the most...

631
00:57:21,305 --> 00:57:23,265
'cause we had to carry that with us.

632
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:30,079
What I do isn't about the people that die.

633
00:57:30,081 --> 00:57:33,415
It's about the people that are left alive.

634
00:57:33,417 --> 00:57:37,687
They get the short end of the
stick, as far as I'm concerned.

635
00:57:38,389 --> 00:57:43,624
Some of them are blindsided, and some of
them think the ends justify the means.

636
00:57:43,928 --> 00:57:48,898
But there ain't no ends,
as long as there's people.

637
00:57:48,900 --> 00:57:50,866
They gone.

638
00:57:51,168 --> 00:57:52,801
Just doesn't matter.

639
00:57:55,138 --> 00:57:59,106
- Yeah, well, I think that...
- I don't give a shit what you think.

640
00:58:02,479 --> 00:58:05,047
And don't get on your high horse with me.

641
00:58:05,049 --> 00:58:09,315
'Cause I didn't show up at your house in the middle
of the night asking you to kill a man for money.

642
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:13,189
Yeah. So I'm sorry.

643
00:58:13,791 --> 00:58:15,757
I just... I'm...

644
00:58:20,764 --> 00:58:21,924
What?

645
00:58:23,801 --> 00:58:28,370
It... It's not like you
still... mourn that dog, right?

646
00:58:31,741 --> 00:58:34,110
What are you talking about?

647
00:58:34,112 --> 00:58:36,573
Just that... there ain't much hope for the dead.

648
00:58:39,516 --> 00:58:40,850
Where's your hope?

649
00:58:40,852 --> 00:58:42,085
I have hope.

650
00:58:42,987 --> 00:58:44,653
I have hope for my sister.

651
00:58:44,855 --> 00:58:49,458
You know, and that-and
that... she can be happy.

652
00:58:49,460 --> 00:58:51,193
She deserves to be happy.

653
00:58:53,796 --> 00:58:57,466
Well, what's his name ain't
gonna get that chance, is he?

654
00:58:57,468 --> 00:58:59,967
- Teddy?
- Yeah.

655
00:59:00,070 --> 00:59:01,569
No, he ain't.

656
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:14,415
- What you watching?
- Sitcom.

657
00:59:16,786 --> 00:59:19,887
- Knew he was gonna say that.
- Why'd you laugh, then?

658
00:59:20,124 --> 00:59:21,564
'Cause it's funny.

659
00:59:27,831 --> 00:59:31,067
So, I guess you think you're pretty funny, then.

660
00:59:31,469 --> 00:59:34,969
- Funnier than you.
- Oh, yeah?

661
00:59:36,140 --> 00:59:37,200
Yeah.

662
00:59:47,017 --> 00:59:48,951
Don't get my hair wet.

663
00:59:49,153 --> 00:59:50,313
Sorry.

664
01:00:08,505 --> 01:00:11,405
- Thought you were watching that?
- No, it's stupid.

665
01:00:11,476 --> 01:00:13,975
Well, it's a sitcom. They're supposed to be.

666
01:00:17,413 --> 01:00:19,213
Oh, hey, oh... go back. I wanna watch that.

667
01:00:19,214 --> 01:00:21,916
- Hey, hey, hey, come on. Give me...
- No. You can't.

668
01:00:24,154 --> 01:00:25,194
Alright.

669
01:01:05,962 --> 01:01:08,562
OK. Good night.

670
01:01:09,567 --> 01:01:11,568
You aren't coming in?

671
01:01:12,770 --> 01:01:14,537
If that's alright?

672
01:01:15,639 --> 01:01:17,239
Yeah, it's fine.

673
01:01:17,241 --> 01:01:19,207
Just don't push it, OK? We're going to sleep.

674
01:01:20,611 --> 01:01:21,751
Alright.

675
01:01:33,589 --> 01:01:36,924
Don't forget, we got dinner tomorrow
night with Gordon and my mom.

676
01:01:36,927 --> 01:01:37,987
Yeah.

677
01:02:26,043 --> 01:02:28,475
- We're here.
- Yep.

678
01:02:29,546 --> 01:02:32,048
I need a shower and a bed.

679
01:02:32,850 --> 01:02:37,749
Well, you'll get it. After you go and
get that cash. I'm gonna do it tonight.

680
01:02:39,090 --> 01:02:41,689
- What, that soon?
- Why not?

681
01:02:42,026 --> 01:02:45,492
I... I don't know. Don't...
don't you have to, like...

682
01:02:45,531 --> 01:02:50,531
- scope out the area, or something?
- Look for... Injuns?

683
01:03:05,049 --> 01:03:07,481
- You go get that money, now.
- Yeah. OK.

684
01:03:07,551 --> 01:03:10,185
Um... do you think you want to park here, though?

685
01:03:10,187 --> 01:03:12,287
'Cause my... my neighbors, they
might see something, or...

686
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:15,022
Well, you'd better hurry up
and go get it, then. Go on.

687
01:03:23,900 --> 01:03:26,300
Well, look who's back from his big im...

688
01:03:45,490 --> 01:03:48,689
- Hey! Who's your friend?
- Mind your own business.

689
01:03:57,600 --> 01:03:58,934
OK.

690
01:03:58,936 --> 01:04:00,936
You can get your car at the train station.

691
01:04:01,038 --> 01:04:02,905
OK. How am I supposed to get it?

692
01:04:02,907 --> 01:04:04,475
I don't care.

693
01:04:06,577 --> 01:04:08,843
- Did you forget something?
- I gave it to you.

694
01:04:08,846 --> 01:04:10,145
I gave you the money. It's in there.

695
01:04:10,147 --> 01:04:13,315
Address?

696
01:04:13,317 --> 01:04:14,449
Right.

697
01:04:14,451 --> 01:04:18,719
- OK, and how do I, uh, contact you?
- You don't.

698
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:39,847
Did you get done what you needed to do?

699
01:04:43,280 --> 01:04:44,300
- Yep.

700
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,084
Why don't you help me clean up?

701
01:05:09,073 --> 01:05:12,507
- I'm so comfortable.

702
01:05:12,509 --> 01:05:18,709
Alright-alright-alright-alright. Just don't...
don't move, 'cause I think we figured it out.

703
01:05:24,922 --> 01:05:27,488
- Cold! My feet are poking out!
- Oh, sorry.

704
01:05:27,558 --> 01:05:30,357
- Cold!
- Sorry. Sorry.

705
01:05:35,498 --> 01:05:36,579
Mm.

706
01:05:56,452 --> 01:06:01,019
- Wait. I don't... no.
- It's alright.

707
01:06:05,361 --> 01:06:07,496
You can't make a fool out of me.

708
01:06:07,898 --> 01:06:09,065
OK?

709
01:06:09,967 --> 01:06:11,401
Promise me.

710
01:06:12,703 --> 01:06:14,170
I won't.

711
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:17,671
I won't. I promise.

712
01:06:33,556 --> 01:06:34,756
You ready?

713
01:06:36,926 --> 01:06:38,166
Guess so.

714
01:06:50,573 --> 01:06:52,340
Smells good, Mom.

715
01:06:52,342 --> 01:06:54,609
Hope it isn't getting wasted.

716
01:06:56,913 --> 01:06:59,314
Mom, do you think you ever lie to yourself?

717
01:06:59,516 --> 01:07:04,254
About, like... things that you care about?

718
01:07:05,556 --> 01:07:07,196
What are you saying?

719
01:07:11,661 --> 01:07:17,696
Nothing, just... you know, maybe you tell
yourself something because... I don't know...

720
01:07:23,506 --> 01:07:27,509
Keep sharp objects away from
me when that man is close.

721
01:07:27,911 --> 01:07:31,510
Let me tell you something. I'm
expecting you to defend your sister.

722
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:33,249
That is your job.

723
01:07:34,251 --> 01:07:35,584
I got it.

724
01:07:36,186 --> 01:07:39,154
We're gonna talk about this
new attitude of yours, later.

725
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:48,462
Molly. It's good to see you.

726
01:07:48,565 --> 01:07:50,632
You're looking a bit better.

727
01:07:50,634 --> 01:07:51,833
Come in.

728
01:07:57,974 --> 01:08:00,841
You watch yourself. Alright?

729
01:08:01,344 --> 01:08:02,743
Yes, ma'am.

730
01:08:09,587 --> 01:08:13,855
Hey. What's this I hear about
business in Mississippi?

731
01:08:14,157 --> 01:08:15,791
You're in demand.

732
01:08:16,293 --> 01:08:18,260
Yeah. Not really.

733
01:08:18,262 --> 01:08:19,702
Well, I'm impressed.

734
01:08:38,214 --> 01:08:39,935
Who wants to say grace?

735
01:08:50,159 --> 01:08:52,094
I'd be happy to.

736
01:08:52,696 --> 01:08:54,656
Why don't you go ahead, then?

737
01:08:58,401 --> 01:09:06,440
Um... dear God, we thank you for the food that...

738
01:09:06,442 --> 01:09:11,279
Angela and Gordon worked so hard to prepare.

739
01:09:11,281 --> 01:09:16,548
And may we learn to appreciate the
gifts the Lord has bestowed upon us.

740
01:09:23,426 --> 01:09:33,226
And may we earn... the...
forgiveness of those around us.

741
01:09:33,871 --> 01:09:38,875
When we s... when we make mistakes...

742
01:09:40,177 --> 01:09:46,982
may we learn to... fulfill our duties as men.

743
01:09:46,984 --> 01:09:49,717
- You've gotta be fucking kidding me.
- Mom!

744
01:09:49,753 --> 01:09:52,020
I wasn't planning on bringing this up.

745
01:09:52,322 --> 01:09:56,158
But you want a conversation of it, I will.

746
01:09:56,660 --> 01:10:00,462
I wasn't kidding when I told you I had a shotgun...

747
01:10:00,464 --> 01:10:02,931
and I'm not gonna use it to kill you...

748
01:10:02,933 --> 01:10:05,700
but if you touch that girl one more time,

749
01:10:05,902 --> 01:10:09,136
I'm gonna use it to cut you off
at the ankles. You got me?

750
01:10:09,206 --> 01:10:11,306
Leave you with two stumps.

751
01:10:11,608 --> 01:10:14,442
And when they get fucking word of what you did...

752
01:10:14,444 --> 01:10:17,778
I'm not gonna be inside very long. And you?

753
01:10:17,780 --> 01:10:21,149
You'll probably get a big
government check every month.

754
01:10:21,351 --> 01:10:24,984
But you better make sure you can make
it to the mailbox in a wheelchair.

755
01:10:28,758 --> 01:10:32,691
- I understand.
- Oh! Well, thank you.

756
01:10:32,963 --> 01:10:35,464
How very humble of you.

757
01:10:36,066 --> 01:10:37,965
Why the hell are you even here?

758
01:10:40,670 --> 01:10:43,303
- I'm sorry. I just wanted to...
- You wanted.

759
01:10:43,375 --> 01:10:48,274
Oh! There's something that you wanted?
Isn't that fucking fascinating?

760
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:50,946
You get this man out of my face.

761
01:10:50,948 --> 01:10:53,615
I'm not here to redeem you, OK?

762
01:10:56,586 --> 01:11:00,153
Get him out of my face. I'm serious.
Get him out of my face!

763
01:11:00,190 --> 01:11:01,356
Hon, can you give us a minute?

764
01:11:01,393 --> 01:11:04,060
- Maybe if I just...
- It's just... go to the porch.

765
01:11:05,062 --> 01:11:06,628
I need to talk to my mother.

766
01:11:13,536 --> 01:11:15,637
If that's what you want.

767
01:11:15,839 --> 01:11:18,240
Yeah, that's what we want.

768
01:11:18,242 --> 01:11:20,374
You feel bad? Good. You should feel bad.

769
01:11:20,376 --> 01:11:23,710
However bad you feel, you should feel worse!

770
01:11:27,917 --> 01:11:31,386
You go have a smoke outside with him.

771
01:11:31,788 --> 01:11:32,908
Yeah.

772
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:00,748
So tell me about Mississippi.

773
01:12:03,652 --> 01:12:05,553
It's the same as here.

774
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:13,561
Gordon... do you think it's
better to do a bad thing

775
01:12:13,563 --> 01:12:18,963
- and you know it's wrong, or...
- Look, if I wanted to bring it up, I-I would have.

776
01:12:19,102 --> 01:12:21,902
I'm not saying that this is an act. I just...

777
01:12:24,004 --> 01:12:26,841
I don't really care how you feel about anything.

778
01:12:32,515 --> 01:12:33,815
Fair enough.

779
01:13:30,773 --> 01:13:33,175
He really can't wait to get off that hook, can he?

780
01:13:33,177 --> 01:13:35,743
Mom. He's fixing it.

781
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:40,246
Men always change until you give
them the chance to change back.

782
01:13:40,250 --> 01:13:43,783
So... what? I'm supposed to move back here?

783
01:13:43,821 --> 01:13:45,588
Start over?

784
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:52,424
I have a life that I like, and there's more to
it than a couple nights that... went... wrong.

785
01:13:52,429 --> 01:14:00,429
You stay... you may never realize
how good life could have been.

786
01:14:01,237 --> 01:14:03,138
Who's got it better?

787
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:04,674
You?

788
01:14:05,676 --> 01:14:06,842
Gordon?

789
01:14:08,344 --> 01:14:10,978
I don't know what this better life
looks like, but I don't see it here.

790
01:14:11,048 --> 01:14:16,880
You sound like someone who's trying to seem real
reasonable about doing something God awful.

791
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:21,087
- Just like your husband on that one, huh?
- I love that you just assume I'm stupid.

792
01:14:21,158 --> 01:14:23,993
Oh, it's not about intelligence, babe.

793
01:14:24,995 --> 01:14:27,629
It's... it's a matter of judgment.

794
01:14:27,831 --> 01:14:31,066
And you're in love with
him, so you don't have any.

795
01:14:31,468 --> 01:14:34,502
Would you please just listen to me, for once?

796
01:14:34,504 --> 01:14:37,738
Ever since you turned 16,
you've stopped listening to me.

797
01:14:40,309 --> 01:14:43,009
It makes sense, I guess. Sixteen year old kid.

798
01:14:43,046 --> 01:14:45,647
Older than her mom was when she was born.

799
01:14:45,849 --> 01:14:49,016
I can't... I can't blame you for
thinking that that made me trash.

800
01:14:49,518 --> 01:14:52,086
And you've been smart, up to this point.

801
01:14:52,088 --> 01:14:55,124
But you cannot have kids with a man like that.

802
01:14:56,126 --> 01:14:57,692
They are all the same.

803
01:14:57,694 --> 01:15:01,995
And I can't approve of this, not one bit.
Not on my watch.

804
01:15:02,032 --> 01:15:03,865
It's not your life.

805
01:15:04,067 --> 01:15:07,499
It's not Gordon's. It's not even Teddy's.
It's mine.

806
01:15:07,571 --> 01:15:09,037
Fine.

807
01:15:09,639 --> 01:15:13,439
Fine. Next time I get a bloody
pulp on my front doorstep,

808
01:15:13,510 --> 01:15:16,310
I don't know if I'm gonna let it in.

809
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:20,949
You don't have to worry about it.

810
01:15:21,051 --> 01:15:23,718
'Cause I don't want anything from you.

811
01:15:23,720 --> 01:15:26,321
Good! 'Cause you're not getting anything!

812
01:15:27,023 --> 01:15:28,555
- Let's go. We're leaving.
- You sure?

813
01:15:28,593 --> 01:15:30,058
- What?
- Oh, yeah.

814
01:15:30,260 --> 01:15:32,526
- And fuck you.
- Fuck me?

815
01:15:32,762 --> 01:15:35,095
Oh, you're not coming back. Not ever.

816
01:15:35,132 --> 01:15:36,664
- Like I would.
- Mom.

817
01:15:36,733 --> 01:15:37,866
You stay out of it.

818
01:15:37,868 --> 01:15:40,200
I'm done. I'm done with this house, OK?

819
01:15:40,237 --> 01:15:42,937
Good! I hope you have a lot of cover up.

820
01:15:43,039 --> 01:15:44,099
Bitch.

821
01:16:04,826 --> 01:16:07,295
Leave me alone, will ya?

822
01:16:07,697 --> 01:16:09,263
Just go back inside.

823
01:16:26,749 --> 01:16:28,015
- Pull over.
- What?

824
01:16:28,017 --> 01:16:29,485
Stop the car!

825
01:16:30,987 --> 01:16:33,919
Uhh! Fuck! I can't stand that woman!

826
01:16:34,057 --> 01:16:35,822
Yeah. Yeah.

827
01:16:38,828 --> 01:16:39,927
Hey. Hey.

828
01:16:39,929 --> 01:16:40,929
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

829
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:42,297
You alright?

830
01:16:42,299 --> 01:16:43,798
Does that hurt?

831
01:17:26,876 --> 01:17:28,143
Sweetheart?

832
01:17:28,945 --> 01:17:30,212
Yeah?

833
01:17:31,114 --> 01:17:32,714
I need something.

834
01:17:32,716 --> 01:17:33,983
What?

835
01:17:35,385 --> 01:17:37,687
I don't know how to tell you.

836
01:17:38,889 --> 01:17:41,421
What? Anything you want, you got it.

837
01:17:43,759 --> 01:17:45,826
- I'm thirsty.
- Oh, come on.

838
01:17:45,829 --> 01:17:48,530
Oh, come... no.

839
01:17:48,532 --> 01:17:50,831
- Yep.
- No, please.

840
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:57,237
OK. OK.

841
01:17:59,308 --> 01:18:00,475
Fuck.

842
01:18:00,777 --> 01:18:02,710
I fed the dog.

843
01:18:02,712 --> 01:18:04,112
Alright.

844
01:18:04,714 --> 01:18:06,014
Fine.

845
01:18:06,716 --> 01:18:07,850
Mm.

846
01:18:08,752 --> 01:18:11,786
Where are my pants?

847
01:18:11,988 --> 01:18:14,221
- They're on the floor.
- OK.

848
01:18:17,059 --> 01:18:18,193
OK.

849
01:18:18,995 --> 01:18:20,996
Alright, here we go.

850
01:18:21,698 --> 01:18:25,332
You owe me so big for this, OK? You hear me?

851
01:19:19,688 --> 01:19:20,708
Here.

852
01:19:49,084 --> 01:19:53,785
Are you just gonna stand around all
night, or do you wanna come back to bed?

853
01:19:53,823 --> 01:19:56,755
Yeah. Yeah, sure.

854
01:19:57,026 --> 01:19:58,459
Give me one sec.

855
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:08,569
I'm thinking of having a beer.

856
01:20:08,571 --> 01:20:10,970
Just one. Is that cool?

857
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:12,406
Yeah, if you want.

858
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:17,077
Just one. You know?

859
01:20:17,080 --> 01:20:19,745
- It's not like...
- If you want to, you should.

860
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:25,720
Alright.

861
01:20:33,362 --> 01:20:35,230
It's all good.

862
01:20:35,932 --> 01:20:37,699
I know.

863
01:20:42,471 --> 01:20:43,831
Jesus.

864
01:20:47,977 --> 01:20:49,177
Hey.

865
01:20:49,179 --> 01:20:51,012
This better be...

866
01:20:58,053 --> 01:20:59,587
You motherfucker!

867
01:20:59,589 --> 01:21:02,155
Fuck you! Son of a bitch!

868
01:21:07,396 --> 01:21:09,029
Hey. Hey!

869
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:13,101
Hey. You wanna die?

870
01:21:13,103 --> 01:21:15,135
Wanna die? Huh?!

871
01:21:15,138 --> 01:21:17,437
You wanna die? Huh?

872
01:21:17,740 --> 01:21:19,139
You wanna die?

873
01:21:32,432 --> 01:21:33,624
Jesus!

874
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:20,861
I shouldn't have yelled at them.

875
01:23:23,866 --> 01:23:25,000
What?

876
01:23:25,702 --> 01:23:26,803
Nothing.

877
01:23:30,439 --> 01:23:33,005
- Mom, I...
- I said nothing.

878
01:24:54,590 --> 01:24:57,356
- I didn't think you'd come.
- What you got under that blanket?

879
01:24:57,393 --> 01:24:59,692
Nothing. I got nothing.

880
01:25:00,329 --> 01:25:02,395
Nothing. Nothing.

881
01:25:05,200 --> 01:25:07,400
Hey. Hey!

882
01:25:07,470 --> 01:25:09,103
You wanna do this?

883
01:25:09,105 --> 01:25:10,337
Come on, man. Come on.

884
01:25:10,339 --> 01:25:12,406
You really want to do this?

885
01:25:14,943 --> 01:25:17,044
The hard part ain't the doin' it.

886
01:25:17,346 --> 01:25:19,682
The hard part is livin' with it.

887
01:25:21,784 --> 01:25:24,151
I'm already living with it.

888
01:25:27,222 --> 01:25:30,389
You do this, it's gonna change you.
You won't know who you are.

889
01:25:30,426 --> 01:25:32,927
I'll know that I'm alive.

890
01:25:33,229 --> 01:25:36,897
Might not mean much to you, but
it'll be more than you have.

891
01:25:45,340 --> 01:25:47,943
I got a brother in Colorado.

892
01:25:49,245 --> 01:25:52,814
I want you... I'm gonna give you...

893
01:25:53,916 --> 01:25:55,782
I'll give you his phone number.

894
01:25:58,286 --> 01:26:01,989
You call him, and tell him
that I am sorry, about the...
