<i>EIGHT WEEKS?</i>

353
00:18:14,626 --> 00:18:16,461
I'M SORRY?

354
00:18:16,528 --> 00:18:19,063
OH, YOU'RE JUST STARTING
TO SHOW,

355
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:21,866
SO I'M GUESSING.
EIGHT WEEKS?

356
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:26,003
UH, YES. EIGHT.

357
00:18:26,071 --> 00:18:29,273
OH, YOU WON'T FEEL
ANYTHING YET, HON.

358
00:18:29,341 --> 00:18:32,009
BUT THEY WILL BE ABLE
TO SHOW YOU THE HEARTBEAT,

359
00:18:32,077 --> 00:18:34,045
AND THAT'S WHEN
IT REALLY HITS YOU.

360
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:35,313
TRUST ME.

00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:38,082
<i>WOW.</i>

<i>IS THIS YOUR FIRST?</i>

363
00:18:40,452 --> 00:18:42,687
YES.

00:18:42,754 --> 00:18:43,821
<i>WOW.</i>

[door opens]

366
00:18:53,298 --> 00:18:56,634
MRS. THIBADEAU,
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

367
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:14,051
DR. FALLON,
YOU WANTED TO SEE ME?

368
00:19:14,119 --> 00:19:15,586
BILLIE, GOOD.
COME IN. SIT DOWN.

369
00:19:15,654 --> 00:19:17,755
<i>I, UH, FINISHED A ROUGH CUT
OF YESTERDAY'S SHOOT,</i>

370
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:19,891
AND I THINK
YOU SHOULD SEE THIS.

371
00:19:19,958 --> 00:19:23,961
<i>AS PHAETON APPROACHES
OUR FINAL GO/NO GO POINT</i>

372
00:19:24,029 --> 00:19:27,899
WHERE A SLINGSHOT AROUND NEPTUNE
CAN SEND US HOME...

373
00:19:27,966 --> 00:19:29,167
OH, GOD.

374
00:19:29,234 --> 00:19:30,701
OR LAUNCH US INTO DEEP SPACE

375
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:33,671
AND THE NEXT PHASE OF OUR
FIVE-YEAR JOURNEY TO ERIDANI,

376
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,574
THE AIR OF TENSION ABOARD
IS PALPABLE.

377
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:37,875
THAT'S TERRIBLE.

378
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:41,179
BILLIE, YOU'RE A NATURAL.

379
00:19:41,246 --> 00:19:43,281
AND IT'S NOT JUST ME
THAT THINKS SO.

380
00:19:43,348 --> 00:19:46,918
FIVE BILLION VIEWERS
CAN'T BE WRONG.

381
00:19:46,985 --> 00:19:48,486
WHAT?

382
00:19:48,554 --> 00:19:51,289
FIVE BILLION.

383
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:52,690
[chuckles]
THAT'S THE BEST RATINGS

384
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,358
WE'VE HAD
SINCE THE LAUNCH,

385
00:19:54,426 --> 00:19:57,061
AND IT'S WAY BETTER THAN
ANYTHING I GOT WHEN I WAS HOST.

386
00:19:57,129 --> 00:19:58,863
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

387
00:19:58,931 --> 00:20:00,598
I'VE BEEN TALKING
TO THE CONSORTIUM,

388
00:20:00,666 --> 00:20:02,166
AND WE'RE ALL IN AGREEMENT.

389
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:03,701
I'M STILL GONNA PRODUCE
THE SHOW,

390
00:20:03,769 --> 00:20:06,704
<i>BUT FROM NOW ON, YOU'RE GONNA BE
THE VOICE OF PHAETON.</i>

391
00:20:06,772 --> 00:20:08,639
YOU'VE GOT
TO BE KIDDING, RIGHT?

392
00:20:08,707 --> 00:20:11,442
YOU'VE GOT SOMETHING
THAT JUST CAN'T BE BOUGHT.

393
00:20:11,510 --> 00:20:12,843
PEOPLE RELATE TO YOU.

394
00:20:12,911 --> 00:20:14,979
I DON'T THINK
THIS IS A GOOD IDEA.

395
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:17,548
LOOK AT IT LIKE THIS--
YOU'RE DOING ME A FAVOR.

396
00:20:17,616 --> 00:20:20,318
I'M A SHRINK. I WAS NEVER
ANY GOOD AT ANY OF THIS.

397
00:20:20,385 --> 00:20:22,853
AS THE REALITIES
OF THIS MISSION SINK IN,

398
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:27,024
I'M GONNA BE GETTING A LOT
MORE PATIENTS THROUGH MY DOOR.

399
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:28,926
DR. FALLON,
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY.

400
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,028
WELL, SAY YES.

401
00:20:31,096 --> 00:20:33,064
<i>[sighs]
YES.</i>

402
00:20:33,131 --> 00:20:35,233
<i>[laughing]
YES.</i>

403
00:20:35,300 --> 00:20:37,335
SAY YES.

404
00:20:37,402 --> 00:20:39,070
(Jean)
EXCUSE ME, DR. FALLON.

405
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:41,505
MANNY AND VAL
WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK WITH YOU.

406
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:44,442
OH, THIS'LL BE FUN.

407
00:20:44,509 --> 00:20:46,611
CONGRATULATIONS, BILLIE.

408
00:20:46,678 --> 00:20:50,214
I'M REALLY PROUD OF YOU.

409
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,582
(Jean)
IT'S TWO DAYS AND COUNTING

410
00:20:51,650 --> 00:20:53,417
<i>UNTIL THE PHAETON
REACHES NEPTUNE,</i>

411
00:20:53,485 --> 00:20:55,419

WE'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR--

412
00:20:55,487 --> 00:20:56,721
GO OR NO GO.

413
00:20:56,788 --> 00:20:58,990
AND WHILE LIFE IS SWEET
FOR KENJI AND ALICE,

414
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:02,393
THINGS ARE STILL SALTY
FOR VAL AND MANNY.

415
00:21:02,461 --> 00:21:05,296
ARE THERE JUST TOO MANY COOKS
IN THIS KITCHEN?

416
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:06,697
<i>PHAETON TV, THE EDGE OF NEVER.</i>

417
00:21:06,765 --> 00:21:08,366
WEDNESDAYS AT 10:00
ONLY ON FOX.

418
00:21:08,433 --> 00:21:09,934
I DON'T WANT ANY MORE FOOTAGE
OF US ARGUING

419
00:21:10,002 --> 00:21:11,636
ENDING UP ON THE SHOW.

420
00:21:11,703 --> 00:21:15,039
LOOK, I AM CONSTANTLY GETTING
NOTES FROM OUR NETWORK PARTNERS

421
00:21:15,107 --> 00:21:17,541
ASKING FOR MORE CONFLICT
IN THE SERIES.

422
00:21:17,609 --> 00:21:20,011
YOU'RE CONSTANTLY MAKING US
INTO BITCHY KINGS.

423
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:21,612
QUEENS.
BITCHY QUEENS.

424
00:21:21,680 --> 00:21:23,381
GUYS, MAYBE THINGS
WOULD BE DIFFERENT

425
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:24,415
IF THE PUBLIC KNEW
WHAT WE KNOW,

426
00:21:24,483 --> 00:21:25,783
<i>BUT THAT'S NOT THE CASE.</i>

427
00:21:25,851 --> 00:21:28,386
I DIDN'T SIGN UP FOR THIS.
I DIDN'T SIGN UP

428
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,654
TO BE AN INTERSTELLAR
PUNCH LINE, ALL RIGHT?

429
00:21:29,721 --> 00:21:31,689
WELL...
[sighs]

430
00:21:31,757 --> 00:21:35,793
LOOK, THINGS ARE MUCH WORSE
THAN THE PUBLIC KNOWS BACK HOME.

431
00:21:35,861 --> 00:21:37,528
DRY LAND IS BECOMING

432
00:21:37,596 --> 00:21:39,930
AN INCREASINGLY
EXPENSIVE COMMODITY.

433
00:21:39,998 --> 00:21:43,868
THE SECURITY COUNCIL
IS CONSIDERING RELOCATION VISAS

434
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:47,204
FOR ANYONE WANTING TO MOVE
FROM THE COASTAL REGIONS INLAND.

435
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:50,741
IT IS THAT BAD?

436
00:21:50,809 --> 00:21:51,876
IT WILL BE.

437
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:54,512
GETTING ON ONE
OF THESE VISA LISTS

438
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:56,213
IS GONNA BE
INCREDIBLY IMPORTANT.

439
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:57,815
[laughs]

440
00:21:57,883 --> 00:21:59,083
I DON'T KNOW
WHY YOU'RE LAUGHING.

441
00:21:59,151 --> 00:22:00,985
I-I HAVE FAMILY IN LONDON,

442
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,487
AND YOU HAVE FAMILY
IN--IN FLORIDA, RIGHT?

443
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:05,156
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

444
00:22:05,223 --> 00:22:07,191
IF I DON'T COOPERATE, THEN
MY FAMILY DOESN'T GET A VISA?

445
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:10,494
THE CONSORTIUM
IS A VERY POWERFUL COMPANY.

446
00:22:10,562 --> 00:22:13,731
THEY'RE GONNA BE WILLING TO HELP
PEOPLE WHO HELP THEM

447
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:16,067
TO MAKE MONEY.

448
00:22:16,134 --> 00:22:17,335
NOW, I-I KNOW YOU GUYS

449
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:18,869
ARE TRYING TO PAINT ME
AS THE VILLAIN HERE,

450
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:21,138
BUT REALLY,
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP YOU.

451
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,841
WE'LL DO IT.

452
00:22:26,345 --> 00:22:27,478
WE'LL DO IT.

453
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,847
YOUR FAMILY WILL NEED HELP.

454
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:36,087
I DO LOVE YOU, YOU KNOW.

455
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:38,189
YOU SHOULD.

456
00:22:38,256 --> 00:22:39,890
(Jean)
ATTENTION, ALL CREW.

457
00:22:39,958 --> 00:22:42,927
PLEASE REPORT IMMEDIATELY
TO THE BRIEFING ROOM.

458
00:22:45,430 --> 00:22:48,766
SO ANY QUESTIONS?

459
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:50,434
<i>YEAH, I HAVE QUESTIONS.</i>

460
00:22:50,502 --> 00:22:51,902
HOW LONG HAVE YOU KNOWN
ABOUT THIS,

461
00:22:51,970 --> 00:22:53,237
AND WHY ARE THE REST OF US
JUST HEARING ABOUT IT NOW?

462
00:22:53,305 --> 00:22:54,472
THAT'S REALLY NOT THE ISSUE.

463
00:22:54,539 --> 00:22:55,806
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT, SIR,

464
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:57,541
THE HELL IT ISN'T.

465
00:22:57,609 --> 00:22:59,210
WOULD YOU GET THAT THING
OUT OF MY FACE?

466
00:22:59,277 --> 00:23:00,378
I'M JUST DOING MY JOB.

467
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,213
DID SOMEONE GIVE YOU
A JOB TO DO?

468
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:04,548
<i>LET'S JUST TRY AND ABSORB
ALL OF THE INFORMATION</i>

469
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:06,450
BEFORE WE MAKE ACCUSATIONS,
SHALL WE?

470
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,919
I'M SORRY, ROGER, BUT IT'S
A QUESTION, NOT AN ACCUSATION.

471
00:23:08,987 --> 00:23:10,588
<i>AND HERE'S YOUR ANSWER.</i>

472
00:23:10,655 --> 00:23:14,425
<i>DOCTOR CAME TO ME YESTERDAY
WITH HIS PRELIMINARY DIAGNOSIS.</i>

473
00:23:14,493 --> 00:23:16,394
I ASKED HIM TO TAKE
SOME MORE TIME TO CONFIRM IT.

474
00:23:16,461 --> 00:23:19,130
HE DID,
AND NOW YOU'RE BEING BRIEFED.

475
00:23:19,197 --> 00:23:22,266
PARKINSON'S?
IS IT FATAL?

476
00:23:22,334 --> 00:23:24,068
NO.

477
00:23:24,136 --> 00:23:27,838
BUT IT CAN LEAD TO SOME
PRETTY SERIOUS COMPLICATIONS.

478
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:29,840
NOW, SO FAR,

479
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,842
I'VE ONLY EXPERIENCED
A FEW SYMPTOMS

480
00:23:31,910 --> 00:23:33,944
AND ONLY INTERMITTENTLY--

481
00:23:34,012 --> 00:23:37,047
SOME HAND TREMORS,
UH, CRAMPED HANDWRITING.

482
00:23:37,115 --> 00:23:38,149
<i>WHAT COMES NEXT?</i>

483
00:23:38,216 --> 00:23:40,050
DO YOU START DROOLING?

484
00:23:42,254 --> 00:23:45,122
<i>WELL, THE SYMPTOMS</i>

485
00:23:45,190 --> 00:23:47,057
AND THEIR RATE
OF PROGRESSION VARIES

486
00:23:47,125 --> 00:23:48,492
<i>BY INDIVIDUAL.</i>

487
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:51,195
<i>BUT COMMONLY,
WE SEE PROBLEMS WITH BALANCE,</i>

488
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,530
<i>UH, MOBILITY,</i>

489
00:23:52,597 --> 00:23:55,166
LATER WITH SPEECH
AND SWALLOWING,

490
00:23:55,233 --> 00:23:56,534
<i>UH, FATIGUE.</i>

491
00:23:56,601 --> 00:23:58,569
BILLIE, I AM NOT KIDDING.
I WILL ANNIHILATE YOU.

492
00:23:58,637 --> 00:24:00,204
I'M JUST DOING MY JOB.
JUST TURN IT OFF!

493
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:03,107
[overlapping shouting]

494
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,375
<i>OKAY, CALM DOWN, SUE.</i>

495
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:05,843
<i>PUT IT AWAY!</i>

496
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,711
<i>PUT IT AWAY!</i>

497
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:09,146
LET'S TURN IT OFF, BILLIE.

498
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:11,315
<i>LET'S JUST ALL TRY
AND STAY FOCUSED.</i>

499
00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:12,983
<i>SHALL I CONTINUE?
PLEASE.</i>

500
00:24:13,051 --> 00:24:15,119
<i>UH, PROBLEMS
WITH SHORT-TERM MEMORY LOSS</i>

501
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:16,487
AND DEMENTIA,

502
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:19,690
INCLUDING HALLUCINATIONS
AND PARANOIA,

503
00:24:19,758 --> 00:24:23,394
<i>ARE POSSIBLE
LATE-TERM DEVELOPMENTS.</i>

504
00:24:23,462 --> 00:24:25,229
ALL RIGHT, THIS CAN BE TREATED
WITH MEDICATION, RIGHT?

505
00:24:25,297 --> 00:24:26,997
SO THE ONLY
RELEVANT QUESTION HERE IS,

506
00:24:27,065 --> 00:24:28,632
"DO WE HAVE THE MEDICATIONS?"

507
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:29,667
YES...

508
00:24:29,734 --> 00:24:30,935
WELL, TO VARYING DEGREES.

509
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,704
AND, YES,
BUT ONLY IN LIMITED SUPPLIES.

510
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:36,307
<i>WE DIDN'T PLAN
FOR SOMETHING LIKE THIS.</i>

511
00:24:39,878 --> 00:24:42,313
OKAY.

512
00:24:42,380 --> 00:24:43,581
WELL, WE WERE COMING UP

513
00:24:43,648 --> 00:24:46,083
ON THE GO/NO GO
DECISION POINT ANYWAY.

514
00:24:46,151 --> 00:24:47,751
ALL THIS MEANS
IS THAT WE'RE FACING IT

515
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:49,153
A LITTLE SOONER
THAN WE ANTICIPATED.

516
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:50,521
<i>I SAY GO.</i>

517
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:52,189
<i>DEMENTIA,
HALLUCINATIONS, PARANOIA--</i>

518
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:53,757
ARE WE ALL GETTING A VOTE?

519
00:24:53,825 --> 00:24:57,628
[overlapping shouting]

520
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:58,629
KIDS!

521
00:24:58,697 --> 00:25:00,431
NO ONE'S VOTING.

522
00:25:00,499 --> 00:25:03,534
THIS ISN'T A DEMOCRACY.

523
00:25:03,602 --> 00:25:05,102
I'LL MAKE THE FINAL DECISION

524
00:25:05,170 --> 00:25:06,904
AFTER HEARING THE DOCTOR'S
PERSONAL AND MEDICAL ASSESSMENT.

525
00:25:06,972 --> 00:25:10,241
NOR IS ANYONE ELSE GONNA BE
BRIEFING MISSION CONTROL

526
00:25:10,308 --> 00:25:12,309
OR THE CONSORTIUM
ABOUT THIS SITUATION.

527
00:25:12,377 --> 00:25:13,477
YOU GOT THAT, ROGER?

528
00:25:19,985 --> 00:25:22,453
AND BY THE WAY,
THIS ISN'T THE ONLY SAFETY ISSUE

529
00:25:22,521 --> 00:25:24,088
WE'RE FACING RIGHT NOW.

530
00:25:24,155 --> 00:25:26,257
JEAN'S GOT A LIST
AS LONG AS MY ARM,

531
00:25:26,324 --> 00:25:28,392
ANY ONE OF WHICH
CAN SCREW UP THIS MISSION.

532
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:33,030
SO IF YOU WANT TO BE PRODUCTIVE,
START DEALING WITH THEM.

533
00:25:33,098 --> 00:25:36,066
<i>I'M JUST PLAYING A ROLE.</i>

534
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:38,002
WE ALL PLAY ROLES ALL THE TIME.

535
00:25:38,069 --> 00:25:39,937
WE BECOME MORE...

536
00:25:40,005 --> 00:25:42,973
DEEPLY ENTRENCHED IN THEM
IN MOMENTS OF CRISIS.

537
00:25:43,041 --> 00:25:45,442
I THINK, FROM AN AUDIENCE
PERSPECTIVE, IT'S VERY EXCITING.

538
00:25:45,510 --> 00:25:48,579
I THINK IT'S AS REAL
AS IT COULD POSSIBLY BE,

539
00:25:48,647 --> 00:25:50,915
AND...

540
00:25:50,982 --> 00:25:54,818
IT MAKES VERY GOOD TELEVISION.

541
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:18,275
IT'S ALWAYS
SO DAMN RESTFUL HERE.

542
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,544
MM, NOT ALWAYS.

543
00:26:25,317 --> 00:26:27,885
OH, THERE ARE STORMS
SOMETIMES.

544
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:30,187
THE LAST ONE ALMOST TOOK OUT
THE SUPPORTS UNDER THIS BALCONY.

545
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:32,957
I'M IN THE MOOD
FOR A STORM RIGHT ABOUT NOW.

546
00:26:33,024 --> 00:26:36,293
THAT COULD BE ARRANGED.

547
00:26:36,361 --> 00:26:37,895
TALK TO ME.

548
00:26:37,963 --> 00:26:39,597
YOU JUST GONNA USE
THIS MEYER THING

549
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:41,131
AS AN EXCUSE
TO DUMP THE WHOLE MISSION?

550
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:42,166
EXCUSE?

551
00:26:42,233 --> 00:26:43,567
I'M NOT SAYING

552
00:26:43,635 --> 00:26:45,469
THAT WE'VE NOT HAD
AN IMPRESSIVE ARRAY OF SETBACKS,

553
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:48,872
BUT IT ALMOST SEEMS

554
00:26:48,940 --> 00:26:51,141
AS THOUGH YOU'VE BEEN LOOKING
FOR A REASON TO ABORT.

555
00:26:51,209 --> 00:26:52,977
IF WE'RE GONNA GO FORWARD
WITH THIS THING,

556
00:26:53,044 --> 00:26:55,245
WE'VE GOT TO BE REALISTIC
ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WE'RE FACING.

557
00:26:55,313 --> 00:26:56,580
I MEAN, COME ON.

558
00:26:56,648 --> 00:26:58,449
MEYER HAS GOT PARKINSON'S.

559
00:26:58,516 --> 00:27:00,484
YEAH, I WAS AT THE BRIEFING.

560
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:01,752
WHAT'S GOING ON...

561
00:27:01,820 --> 00:27:03,153
REALLY?

562
00:27:03,221 --> 00:27:05,489
IT'S NOT THE--

563
00:27:05,557 --> 00:27:07,257
THE FACTS OF WHAT THEY TOLD US,
SO MUCH...

564
00:27:07,325 --> 00:27:09,159
IT'S THE TIMING.

565
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:12,262
I MEAN,
ENVIRONMENTAL DISASTER, OKAY?

566
00:27:12,330 --> 00:27:14,565
<i>HOW LONG HAVE WE BEEN WAITING
FOR THAT SHOE TO DROP?</i>

567
00:27:14,633 --> 00:27:17,134
<i>BUT FOR IT TO GO
SO WRONG SO FAST,</i>

568
00:27:17,202 --> 00:27:19,670
IT'S A LOT TO SWALLOW.

569
00:27:19,738 --> 00:27:21,438
AND THE CLOSER
WE GET TO GO/NO GO,

570
00:27:21,506 --> 00:27:23,073
THE TOUGHER IT GETS.

571
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:26,043
YOU'RE IMPLYING
THAT THEY'RE LYING TO US.

572
00:27:26,111 --> 00:27:29,546
THIS IS A $200-BILLION PROJECT.
YEAH.

573
00:27:29,614 --> 00:27:31,382
THEY'RE NOT GONNA START
PLAYING GAMES.

574
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:33,784
MAYBE IT'S SOME KIND OF TEST.

575
00:27:33,852 --> 00:27:35,919
[chuckles]
OF WHAT?
OF ME.

576
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,094
I'VE BEEN GETTING THIS FEELING
FOR A WHILE NOW

577
00:27:44,162 --> 00:27:46,263
THAT MISSION CONTROL
DOESN'T EXACTLY HAVE

578
00:27:46,331 --> 00:27:47,798
THE GREATEST FAITH
IN THEIR COMMANDER.

579
00:27:47,866 --> 00:27:49,600
COME ON.

580
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,402
IT'S NOT SAID OUT LOUD
ON AN OPEN CHANNEL.

581
00:27:51,469 --> 00:27:54,338
BUT READING BETWEEN THE LINES,

582
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:56,106
I'M NOT SO SURE THEY WOULDN'T
RATHER SEE SOMEONE ELSE

583
00:27:56,174 --> 00:27:57,608
IN COMMAND UP HERE.

584
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:02,312
HEY...

585
00:28:02,380 --> 00:28:04,782
LOOK ME IN THE EYE AND TELL ME
THAT YOU BELIEVE THAT.

586
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:11,321
I DON'T KNOW WHAT I BELIEVE.

587
00:28:11,389 --> 00:28:13,123
MAYBE YOU'RE RIGHT.
MAYBE I'M OVER-THINKING THIS.

588
00:28:13,191 --> 00:28:14,158
YEAH.
BUT I--

589
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:16,060
I'VE GOT THIS FEELING
IN MY GUT.

590
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:17,428
IT JUST DOESN'T ADD UP.

591
00:28:17,495 --> 00:28:19,430
I KNOW THERE'S SOMETHING
THEY'RE NOT TELLING US.

592
00:28:19,497 --> 00:28:22,266
I--I KNOW THAT--

593
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:23,467
OH.

594
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:26,203
I'M SORRY.
DO--DO GO ON.

595
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:31,508
YOU SHOULD COME
TO MY PLACE SOME TIME.

596
00:28:31,576 --> 00:28:33,877
YOU'D LIKE IT--
OPEN AIR, INTERESTING PEOPLE.

597
00:28:33,945 --> 00:28:36,814
YEAH, YOU KNOW WHAT, FRANK?

598
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:38,649
I'M BORED.

599
00:28:38,717 --> 00:28:40,551
COME AND PLAY WITH ME.

600
00:28:44,522 --> 00:28:47,558
[mellow music]

601
00:28:47,625 --> 00:28:55,399
¶ ¶

602
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:04,108
[breathing heavily]

603
00:29:11,249 --> 00:29:14,084
[ringing]

604
00:29:15,754 --> 00:29:18,088
YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING ME.
WHO'S CALLING YOU HERE?

605
00:29:18,156 --> 00:29:20,290
I DIDN'T PROGRAM IT.

606
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:23,293
[breathing heavily]

607
00:29:23,361 --> 00:29:25,796
[ringing continues]

608
00:29:25,864 --> 00:29:28,031
ARE YOU GONNA ANSWER IT?

609
00:29:33,071 --> 00:29:34,972
HELLO?

610
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:36,573
<i>(man on phone)
I'M VERY DISAPPOINTED
IN YOU, RIKA.</i>

611
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:37,941
WHAT?
WHO IS THIS?

612
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:39,610
<i>YOU'RE BEHAVING VERY BADLY.
YOU KNOW THAT.</i>

613
00:29:39,677 --> 00:29:41,712
WHO IS IT?

614
00:29:41,780 --> 00:29:43,046
I DON'T KNOW.
I CA--

615
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:44,615
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

616
00:29:44,682 --> 00:29:47,117
<i>I SAID,
"YOU'RE BEHAVING VERY BADLY."</i>

617
00:29:47,185 --> 00:29:49,319
<i>BOTH OF YOU.
WHAT THE HELL?</i>

618
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:52,923
CAPTAIN.

619
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:57,628
WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?

620
00:29:57,695 --> 00:29:59,062
WAIT A MINUTE.

621
00:29:59,130 --> 00:30:00,864
<i>HE'S FROM MY MODULE.</i>

622
00:30:00,932 --> 00:30:03,400
YOU BROUGHT HIM OVER HERE?

623
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,769
I DON'T EVEN KNOW
HOW TO DO THAT.

624
00:30:09,174 --> 00:30:11,675
<i>NO ONE BROUGHT ME
OVER HERE, FRANK.</i>

625
00:30:11,743 --> 00:30:13,177
I AM HERE,

626
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:15,946
<i>AND I TOLD YOU BEFORE...</i>

627
00:30:16,014 --> 00:30:18,248
YOU'RE NOT FOOLING ANYONE.
[gasps]

628
00:30:18,316 --> 00:30:19,683
[scream]

629
00:30:22,086 --> 00:30:23,020
UGH!

630
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:26,857
[breathing heavily]

631
00:30:26,925 --> 00:30:29,760
[gasps, breathing heavily]

632
00:30:32,697 --> 00:30:36,333
HEY, BABY, BABY,
IT'S OKAY.

633
00:30:36,401 --> 00:30:37,634
IT'S OKAY.

634
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,603
IT'S OKAY.

635
00:30:39,671 --> 00:30:42,973
SHH, IT'S OKAY.
IT'S OKAY.

636
00:30:43,041 --> 00:30:44,942
IT'S OKAY.
DON'T WORRY.

637
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,153
HEY, COME ON, LIE DOWN.

638
00:30:59,057 --> 00:31:00,190
SHH.

639
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:04,394
IT'S OKAY.

640
00:31:07,131 --> 00:31:08,732
I CAN'T IMAGINE THE SCENARIO

641
00:31:08,800 --> 00:31:11,535
IN WHICH MY WIFE
WOULDN'T BE HERE WITH ME.

642
00:31:13,605 --> 00:31:17,040
AND YES, IT GIVES ME
SOME COMFORT.

643
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:23,080
[sniffs]

644
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:26,683
ARE WE GOING, FRANK?

645
00:31:26,751 --> 00:31:27,651
WHAT?
SORRY.

646
00:31:31,089 --> 00:31:32,456
I HAVEN'T MADE A DECISION.

647
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:34,124
YOU'LL BE THE FIRST, OKAY?

648
00:31:34,192 --> 00:31:35,792
<i>REALLY?
YEAH.</i>

649
00:31:35,860 --> 00:31:39,396
PROMISE?

650
00:31:39,464 --> 00:31:41,198
OKAY.

651
00:31:41,266 --> 00:31:42,966
IT'S JUST THE THING IS, FRANK,

652
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,469
IF SOMETHING
WERE TO HAPPEN TO YOU--

653
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:47,271
[mumbling]
HIT BY A BUS--

654
00:31:47,338 --> 00:31:49,373
[chuckling]

655
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,408
<i>IF SOMETHING
WERE TO HAPPEN TO YOU,</i>

656
00:31:51,476 --> 00:31:53,243
<i>I'M THE ONE
THAT HAS TO PICK UP THE BAG,</i>

657
00:31:53,311 --> 00:31:56,480
AND I REALLY SHOULD KNOW
WHERE THE BAG IS.

658
00:31:56,547 --> 00:31:59,816
JIMMY.

659
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:03,253
I JUST TOLD YOU
I HAVEN'T DECIDED YET.

660
00:32:03,321 --> 00:32:05,555
I'LL LET YOU KNOW, OKAY?

661
00:32:05,623 --> 00:32:08,325
OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
YEAH.

662
00:32:10,128 --> 00:32:12,529
I'LL GO, THEN.

663
00:32:12,597 --> 00:32:14,064
I SHALL BE TENDING
TO THE CHILDREN,

664
00:32:14,132 --> 00:32:17,734
IF YOU CHANGE YOUR MIND.

665
00:32:17,802 --> 00:32:19,469
HURRAH.

666
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:23,807
<i>HERE'S A RARE MOMENT
OF TRUTHFULNESS.</i>

667
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:26,143
<i>I...</i>

668
00:32:26,210 --> 00:32:28,378
<i>RESPECT THE MAN GREATLY.</i>

669
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:32,449
I WISH HE RESPECTED ME

670
00:32:32,517 --> 00:32:34,351
AS MUCH...

671
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:39,356
AS I DO HIM.

672
00:32:39,424 --> 00:32:40,791
<i>BIOLOGICAL PROTECTION
IN THE ROOT ZONE.</i>

673
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:42,125
<i>I MEAN, I THINK I CAN FIX IT</i>

674
00:32:42,193 --> 00:32:43,260
<i>BY INTRODUCING
SOME PROTECTIVE MICROBES</i>

675
00:32:43,328 --> 00:32:44,995
<i>INTO THE SOLUTION.
GOOD.</i>

676
00:32:45,063 --> 00:32:46,663
<i>LAST THING WE NEED IS A THREAT
TO OUR FRESH FOOD AND OXYGEN.</i>

677
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,332
<i>WELL, EXACTLY.
UM, I MEAN, LET ME SHOW YOU</i>

678
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:50,000
<i>SOME OF THESE TEST SLIDES
I'VE BEEN WORKING ON.</i>

679
00:32:50,068 --> 00:32:51,835
WHAT EXACTLY HAPPENED
LAST NIGHT?

680
00:32:54,038 --> 00:32:55,739
I HAVE NO IDEA.

681
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:58,141
I DIDN'T THINK ANY OF US COULD
GET INTO SOMEONE ELSE'S MODULE

682
00:32:58,209 --> 00:32:59,776
WITHOUT AN INVITATION
AND AN ACCESS CODE.

683
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,545
AND I GATHER YOU DIDN'T EXTEND
MY INVITATION

684
00:33:01,612 --> 00:33:02,846
TO YOUR LITTLE FRIEND.

685
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,381
SO HE COULD EXECUTE US
IN THE SACK?

686
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:05,749
I'M NOT THAT KINKY.

687
00:33:05,817 --> 00:33:07,517
YOU HAVE YOUR MOMENTS.

688
00:33:08,953 --> 00:33:10,620
YOU KNOW,
IT'S EXACTLY THE KIND OF STUNT

689
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:12,990
ROGER WOULD PULL IF HE KNEW
I WAS CHEATING ON HIM.

690
00:33:13,057 --> 00:33:14,791
NO ONE'S CHEATING
ON ANYONE HERE.

691
00:33:14,859 --> 00:33:17,227
THIS IS ALL
JUST SOME HARMLESS FANTASY.

692
00:33:17,295 --> 00:33:18,562
REALLY?

693
00:33:18,629 --> 00:33:20,597
THEN YOU WOULDN'T MIND
IF I TOLD MY HUSBAND,

694
00:33:20,665 --> 00:33:22,532
WOULD YOU?

695
00:33:22,600 --> 00:33:24,234

1216
00:59:58,776 --> 01:00:00,309
JEAN?
JEAN, WHAT IS THIS?

1217
01:00:00,377 --> 01:00:01,644
JEAN!

1218
01:00:11,422 --> 01:00:14,257
[breathing heavily]

1219
01:00:18,062 --> 01:00:19,429
JEAN.

1220
01:00:19,496 --> 01:00:21,130
PROGRAM OFF.

1221
01:00:23,634 --> 01:00:25,034

1222
01:00:25,102 --> 01:00:26,636

1223
01:00:26,704 --> 01:00:27,670
JEAN...

1224
01:00:27,738 --> 01:00:31,340
FREEZE PROGRAM, JEAN.

1225
01:00:33,777 --> 01:00:35,978
IT'S YOUR FANTASY, BILLIE.

1226
01:00:36,046 --> 01:00:37,180
WHY NOT ENJOY IT?

1227
01:00:37,247 --> 01:00:40,183
[gasping]

1228
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:43,319
[crying]

1229
01:00:51,829 --> 01:00:54,129
I THINK WE SHOULD TAKE
THE ENTIRE PROGRAM OFF-LINE,

1230
01:00:54,197 --> 01:00:56,064
ALL THE VIRT MODULES,
UNTIL I CAN FIX THE PROBLEM.

1231
01:00:56,132 --> 01:00:57,232
I MEAN, WHAT IF SOMEBODY

1232
01:00:57,300 --> 01:00:59,001
GETS TRAPPED
IN AN EVEN WORSE SITUATION

1233
01:00:59,068 --> 01:01:00,502
AND STRUGGLES TO GET OUT OF IT
LIKE I DID?

1234
01:01:00,570 --> 01:01:03,238
THERE COULD BE SYNAPTIC DAMAGE
FOR ALL I KNOW.

1235
01:01:03,306 --> 01:01:04,706
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT,
BUT I'M WONDERING

1236
01:01:04,774 --> 01:01:06,375
IF YOU'RE TREATING THIS ONE
A LITTLE BIT INTELLECTUALLY.

1237
01:01:06,442 --> 01:01:08,210
YOUR COMPUTER GLITCH
THAT NEEDS TO BE SOLVED,

1238
01:01:08,277 --> 01:01:09,945
RATHER THAN SOMETHING
VERY TRAUMATIC

1239
01:01:10,013 --> 01:01:11,380
THAT HAPPENED
TO YOU PERSONALLY.

1240
01:01:11,447 --> 01:01:13,782
WELL, NOTHING HAPPENED
TO ME, REALLY.

1241
01:01:13,850 --> 01:01:16,485
I MEAN, PHYSICALLY,
IN REALITY, NOTHING HAPPENED.

1242
01:01:16,552 --> 01:01:17,986
[scoffs]
IF YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

1243
01:01:18,054 --> 01:01:19,755
IT'S NO DIFFERENT
THAN A BAD DREAM,

1244
01:01:19,822 --> 01:01:21,289
AND DREAMS AREN'T REAL,
RIGHT?

1245
01:01:21,357 --> 01:01:24,059
WELL, THE EVENTS
THEY PORTRAY MAY NOT BE,

1246
01:01:24,127 --> 01:01:25,827
BUT THE FEELINGS DREAMS EVOKE

1247
01:01:25,895 --> 01:01:28,030
AND THE MEMORIES
THEY LEAVE BEHIND,

1248
01:01:28,097 --> 01:01:30,432
THEY CAN BE AS REAL
AS ANYTHING IN OUR LIVES.

1249
01:01:30,500 --> 01:01:34,670
BUT I'M--I'M CURIOUS WHY YOU
CHOSE TO DESCRIBE IT AS A DREAM.

1250
01:01:34,737 --> 01:01:38,807
I'M SORRY.
UH, WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

1251
01:01:38,875 --> 01:01:41,009
WELL, SOME PEOPLE
BELIEVE THAT DREAMS

1252
01:01:41,077 --> 01:01:42,678
ARE THE MIND'S WAY
OF EXPLORING THINGS

1253
01:01:42,745 --> 01:01:46,615
THAT WOULD ORDINARILY
BE SUPPRESSED IN WAKING HOURS.

1254
01:01:46,683 --> 01:01:48,050
YOU'RE TALKING
ABOUT FANTASIES.

1255
01:01:48,117 --> 01:01:49,284
I DON'T HAVE A RAPE FANTASY,

1256
01:01:49,352 --> 01:01:50,819
IF THAT'S
WHAT YOU'RE GETTING AT.

1257
01:01:50,887 --> 01:01:53,522
NO, I'M NOT GETTING
AT ANYTHING, BILLIE.

1258
01:01:53,589 --> 01:01:57,592
I'M JUST SHOWING YOU
YOUR CHOICE OF WORDS.

1259
01:01:57,660 --> 01:01:59,327
BY DESCRIBING IT AS A DREAM,

1260
01:01:59,395 --> 01:02:01,563
YOU'RE IMPLYING IT'S SOMETHING
THAT YOU DREAMT UP,

1261
01:02:01,631 --> 01:02:04,433
AS IF, IN SOME WAY, YOU BLAME
YOURSELF FOR WHAT HAPPENED

1262
01:02:04,500 --> 01:02:06,802
OR EVEN FEEL YOU DESERVED IT.

1263
01:02:15,411 --> 01:02:17,345
IT'S A COMPUTER GLITCH,

1264
01:02:17,413 --> 01:02:21,049
AND THAT'S ALL IT IS.

1265
01:02:21,117 --> 01:02:23,318
[door opens]

1266
01:02:25,788 --> 01:02:30,192
THE VIRT MODULES
WERE YOUR BABY, ROGER.

1267
01:02:30,259 --> 01:02:31,727
<i>YOU FOUGHT TO INCLUDE THEM
IN THE MISSION.</i>

1268
01:02:31,794 --> 01:02:33,562
<i>NOW YOU WANT THEM SHUT DOWN?</i>

1269
01:02:33,629 --> 01:02:36,998
WELL, ACTUALLY,
IT'S THE LAST THING I WANT,

1270
01:02:37,066 --> 01:02:39,134
BUT THE SAFETY OF THE CREW
HAS TO BE PARAMOUNT.

1271
01:02:41,571 --> 01:02:43,772
<i>"IN PSYCHOLOGICAL TERMS,

<i>HOW IS SHE?
SHE'S IN SHOCK.</i>

1293
01:03:26,749 --> 01:03:27,883
RIGHT.

1294
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:30,152
SHE'S HANGING ON

1295
01:03:30,219 --> 01:03:31,953
TO THE VIRTUAL NATURE
OF THE EXPERIENCE

1296
01:03:32,021 --> 01:03:34,189
AS A WAY OF SAYING
IT WASN'T REAL,

1297
01:03:34,257 --> 01:03:35,524
THEREFORE NOTHING HAPPENED,

1298
01:03:35,591 --> 01:03:37,225
AND SHE DOESN'T NEED TREATMENT.

1299
01:03:37,293 --> 01:03:39,561
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1300
01:03:39,629 --> 01:03:40,896
WAS IT REAL?

1301
01:03:40,963 --> 01:03:43,398
WHAT ARE YOU ASKING ME,
FRANK?

1302
01:03:43,466 --> 01:03:47,769
I'M ASKING IF YOU KNOW
FANTASY FROM REALITY, ROGER.

1303
01:03:47,837 --> 01:03:50,605
I THINK I DO.

1304
01:03:52,942 --> 01:03:54,609
DO YOU KNOW WHAT'S REAL, FRANK?

1305
01:04:04,320 --> 01:04:06,488
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT I THINK.

1306
01:04:09,258 --> 01:04:13,528
I THINK THIS MISSION
HAS CHANGED.

1307
01:04:13,596 --> 01:04:16,631
I THINK OUR EYES
ARE ABOUT TO BE OPENED

1308
01:04:16,699 --> 01:04:18,834
AND THAT--THAT--
THAT WE ARE ON THE VERGE

1309
01:04:18,901 --> 01:04:20,802
OF A PROFOUND AWAKENING

1310
01:04:20,870 --> 01:04:23,572
THAT--THAT YOU AND I
CANNOT EVEN IMAGINE.

1311
01:04:23,639 --> 01:04:27,843
AND I THINK THE VIRT MODULES
ARE CRUCIAL TO THAT AWAKENING.

1312
01:04:27,910 --> 01:04:31,213
I WON'T SHUT THEM DOWN.

1313
01:04:31,280 --> 01:04:33,515
IN MY PROFESSIONAL OPINION,
YOUR BEHAVIOR OF LATE

1314
01:04:33,583 --> 01:04:35,217
HAS BEEN ERRATIC AT BEST.

1315
01:04:35,284 --> 01:04:36,685
ARE YOU SAYING THAT
TO MISSION CONTROL?

1316
01:04:36,752 --> 01:04:40,789
I KNOW THE VALUE OF LOYALTY
IN ANY ISOLATED CREW, FRANK,

1317
01:04:40,857 --> 01:04:44,125
AND I LIVE ON THE SHIP TOO.

1318
01:04:44,193 --> 01:04:45,727
WHAT'S REALLY GOING ON?

1319
01:04:45,795 --> 01:04:49,197
I ONCE WAS LOST,
BUT NOW I'M FOUND.

1320
01:04:49,265 --> 01:04:52,567
WAS BLIND, BUT NOW I SEE.

1321
01:04:52,635 --> 01:04:55,971
<i>LOOK, AT THE VERY LEAST,</i>

1322
01:04:56,038 --> 01:04:58,773
<i>THE CREW DESERVE
TO KNOW THE FACTS.</i>

1323
01:04:58,841 --> 01:05:01,176
THEY'RE OUR FRIENDS
AS WELL AS OUR COLLEAGUES.

1324
01:05:01,244 --> 01:05:03,178
DON'T LEAD THEM

1325
01:05:03,246 --> 01:05:05,814
INTO TREACHEROUS WATERS
UNAWARE, FRANK.

1326
01:05:05,882 --> 01:05:07,449
YOU KNOW, ROGER,
YOU'RE RIGHT THERE.

1327
01:05:07,516 --> 01:05:10,285
THEY DO DESERVE
TO KNOW THE TRUTH.

1328
01:05:10,353 --> 01:05:13,688
THE TRUTH
SHALL SET THEM FREE.

1329
01:05:15,424 --> 01:05:17,259
WHOO!

1330
01:05:26,102 --> 01:05:29,204
A SEXUAL ASSAULT?
COULD YOU BE MORE SPECIFIC?

1331
01:05:29,272 --> 01:05:30,405
ASSAULT AGAINST WHO?

1332
01:05:30,473 --> 01:05:32,574
WELL, THERE'S
A PRIVACY ISSUE HERE.

1333
01:05:32,642 --> 01:05:35,076
I'M NOT AT LIBERTY TO DESCRIBE
THE ATTACK IN DETAIL

1334
01:05:35,144 --> 01:05:36,578
OR WHO EXPERIENCED IT.

1335
01:05:36,646 --> 01:05:38,680
BUT IN MY OPINION,
THERE IS A SERIOUS DEFECT

1336
01:05:38,748 --> 01:05:40,181
IN THE VIRT SOFTWARE,

1337
01:05:40,249 --> 01:05:41,917
AND I'M STRONGLY RECOMMENDING

1338
01:05:41,984 --> 01:05:44,552
THAT WE REFRAIN
FROM USING THE VIRT MODULES.

1339
01:05:44,620 --> 01:05:46,721
UH, FOR HOW LONG?

1340
01:05:46,789 --> 01:05:51,126
UNTIL WE KNOW THE PROBLEM'S
BEEN IDENTIFIED AND REPAIRED.

1341
01:05:51,193 --> 01:05:52,694
CAN'T WE JUST UPLOAD
NEW SOFTWARE?

1342
01:05:52,762 --> 01:05:54,996
NOT AT THIS RANGE AND SPEED.

1343
01:05:55,064 --> 01:05:56,998
WE'RE LUCKY TO GET
SIMPLE ENGINEERING PACKETS,

1344
01:05:57,066 --> 01:05:59,000
LET ALONE
COMPLEX SOFTWARE UPLOADS.

1345
01:05:59,068 --> 01:06:00,735
<i>I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ANYTHING TO FEAR</i>

1346
01:06:00,803 --> 01:06:01,970
FROM THE VIRT MODULES.

1347
01:06:02,038 --> 01:06:03,772
ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT A PERMANENT SHUTDOWN?

1348
01:06:03,839 --> 01:06:06,174
POSSIBLY.

1349
01:06:06,242 --> 01:06:09,077
<i>WELL...</i>

1350
01:06:09,145 --> 01:06:11,146
WE'VE ALL EXPERIENCED
COMPUTER GLITCHES BEFORE,

1351
01:06:11,213 --> 01:06:13,782
AND JUST TO PLAY
DEVIL'S ADVOCATE HERE,

1352
01:06:13,849 --> 01:06:16,484
ISN'T IT POSSIBLE
THAT WE'RE OVERREACTING?

1353
01:06:16,552 --> 01:06:18,687
YOU HEARD HIM SAY
"SEXUAL ASSAULT," RIGHT?

1354
01:06:18,754 --> 01:06:20,689
[sighs]
YES.

1355
01:06:20,756 --> 01:06:22,524
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN EXACTLY?

1356
01:06:22,591 --> 01:06:23,992
<i>I MEAN, THERE'S A BIG
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN SOMEBODY</i>

1357
01:06:24,060 --> 01:06:27,562
<i>GETTING A PINCH ON THE ASS
AND BEING GANG-RAPED.</i>

1358
01:06:27,630 --> 01:06:30,565
SOMEONE WAS VIOLATED
BY A COMPUTER PROGRAM.

1359
01:06:30,633 --> 01:06:32,300
<i>DOESN'T MATTER
WHAT IT MEANS EXACTLY.</i>

1360
01:06:32,368 --> 01:06:34,369
UM, FOR ONCE, I HAVE TO AGREE
WITH JIMMY HERE.

1361
01:06:34,437 --> 01:06:36,538
<i>AND I DON'T MEAN TO SOUND
INSENSITIVE OR ANYTHING,</i>

1362
01:06:36,605 --> 01:06:38,773
<i>BUT, UH, THESE PROGRAMS
ARE THE ONLY CHANCE</i>

1363
01:06:38,841 --> 01:06:41,242
THAT ANY OF US HAVE
FOR PRIVACY HERE ON THE SHIP.

1364
01:06:41,310 --> 01:06:43,511
<i>AND IF ALL WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
IS SOME C.G. CHARACTER</i>

1365
01:06:43,579 --> 01:06:44,980
<i>COPPING A FEEL,
I DON'T THINK IT'S A--</i>

1366
01:06:45,047 --> 01:06:47,415
WAIT, I'M SORRY.
WHAT KIND OF LOGIC IS THAT?

1367
01:06:47,483 --> 01:06:49,317
ONE OF THESE CHARACTERS
SHOT ME, JULES.

1368
01:06:49,385 --> 01:06:51,586
SORRY, IS MURDER
A GRAY AREA FOR YOU TOO?

1369
01:06:51,654 --> 01:06:54,789
PEOPLE GET SHOT IN THEIR ACTION
PROGRAMS ALL THE TIME.

1370
01:06:54,857 --> 01:06:57,325
<i>IT WASN'T
IN AN ACTION PROGRAM.</i>

1371
01:06:57,393 --> 01:06:58,860
I WAS RELAXING
IN MY BEACH HOUSE.

1372
01:06:58,928 --> 01:07:00,195
I WAS SUPPOSED TO BE ALONE.

1373
01:07:00,262 --> 01:07:02,030
<i>AN INTRUDER CAME IN</i>

1374
01:07:02,098 --> 01:07:05,867
<i>AND SHOT ME IN MY BED
WHEN I WAS ALONE.</i>

1375
01:07:05,935 --> 01:07:10,405
<i>SO YOU WERE SHOT,
AND SOMEONE ELSE WAS ASSAULTED.</i>

1376
01:07:10,473 --> 01:07:12,974
<i>IT'S A SIMULATION.</i>

1377
01:07:13,042 --> 01:07:15,377
LOOK, JUST GO BACK IN,

1378
01:07:15,444 --> 01:07:17,245
CREATE A COUPLE MACHINE GUNS,

1379
01:07:17,313 --> 01:07:18,613
<i>TAKE YOUR REVENGE.</i>

1380
01:07:18,681 --> 01:07:21,583
<i>YOU'LL FEEL BETTER,
BELIEVE ME.</i>

1381
01:07:25,021 --> 01:07:26,454
LOOK, I'M SORRY.

1382
01:07:26,522 --> 01:07:29,657
<i>I JUST DON'T SEE
WHAT THE BIG DEAL IS.</i>

1383
01:07:29,725 --> 01:07:31,693
<i>NONE OF IT'S REAL.
IT'S ALL IN YOUR HEAD.</i>

1384
01:07:33,763 --> 01:07:35,130
BRILLIANT, BRILLIANT.

1385
01:07:35,197 --> 01:07:38,299
YOU AND I ARE GONNA
REVISIT THIS.

1386
01:07:46,042 --> 01:07:49,277
WELL, WE'RE STILL WAITING
TO HEAR FROM YOU, SKIPPER.

1387
01:07:49,345 --> 01:07:51,779
GONNA SHUT DOWN
THE MODULES OR NOT?

1388
01:07:56,017 --> 01:07:57,918
<i>NO, I'M NOT.</i>

1389
01:08:04,192 --> 01:08:05,459
<i>KNOCK, KNOCK.</i>

1390
01:08:07,829 --> 01:08:09,130
WHAT?

1391
01:08:09,197 --> 01:08:10,798
CAN I COME IN?

1392
01:08:12,667 --> 01:08:13,934
YEAH.

1393
01:08:28,784 --> 01:08:29,850
I'M SORRY.

1394
01:08:29,918 --> 01:08:31,552
<i>THEY'RE IDIOTS.</i>

1395
01:08:31,620 --> 01:08:34,722
I KNEW THAT.

1396
01:08:36,958 --> 01:08:38,425
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

1397
01:08:38,493 --> 01:08:42,163
[scoffs]
I'M 24.

1398
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:47,234
I WAS 24
WHEN I JOINED THE MARINES.

1399
01:08:49,004 --> 01:08:52,039
<i>AND I WAS ON, UH...</i>

1400
01:08:52,107 --> 01:08:55,409
<i>I WAS ON
THIS TRAINING MISSION,</i>

1401
01:08:55,477 --> 01:08:58,145
AND TWO GUYS
FROM MY OWN UNIT...

1402
01:08:59,981 --> 01:09:01,982
THEY, UM...

1403
01:09:10,458 --> 01:09:12,259
YOU KNOW, THESE GUYS--

1404
01:09:12,327 --> 01:09:15,496
I MEAN, I--I ATE WITH THEM.

1405
01:09:15,564 --> 01:09:19,533
I RACKED WITH THEM.
I--IT--

1406
01:09:19,601 --> 01:09:23,871
AND THAT WAS THE WORST PART,
YOU KNOW?

1407
01:09:23,939 --> 01:09:28,042
JUST THE REALIZATION
THAT NONE OF THAT MATTERED,

1408
01:09:28,109 --> 01:09:30,277
THAT I DIDN'T EVEN
REALLY EXIST TO THEM.

1409
01:09:30,345 --> 01:09:32,446
[scoffs]

1410
01:09:32,514 --> 01:09:34,281
<i>THAT'S THE THING, YOU KNOW.</i>

1411
01:09:34,349 --> 01:09:37,117
<i>LIKE, THESE GUYS--
THEY DON'T GET IT, YOU KNOW.</i>

1412
01:09:37,185 --> 01:09:39,286
<i>THEY DON'T GET THAT--</i>

1413
01:09:39,354 --> 01:09:41,155
<i>THAT EVEN WHEN SOMETHING
LIKE THIS HAPPENS</i>

1414
01:09:41,223 --> 01:09:43,123
<i>IN THE REAL WORLD,</i>

1415
01:09:43,191 --> 01:09:45,826
<i>YOUR MIND IS WHERE IT HAPPENS,</i>

1416
01:09:45,894 --> 01:09:47,761
<i>MORE THAN YOUR BODY.</i>

1417
01:09:47,829 --> 01:09:52,266
I MEAN, WHEN THAT'S GOING ON,
YOU'RE NOT EVEN IN YOUR BODY.

1418
01:09:52,334 --> 01:09:54,702
<i>THEY'VE ALREADY TAKEN THAT
FROM YOU.</i>

1419
01:09:57,472 --> 01:10:01,008
<i>THE ONLY THING
THAT I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW</i>

1420
01:10:01,076 --> 01:10:03,143
<i>IS YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY.</i>

1421
01:10:03,211 --> 01:10:06,580
DON'T LISTEN TO THOSE ASSES
TELLING YOU THAT IT'S NOT REAL

1422
01:10:06,648 --> 01:10:09,283
OR IT'S ALL IN YOUR HEAD,
AND SO IT DOESN'T MATTER.

1423
01:10:09,351 --> 01:10:12,486
<i>JUST FEEL IT.</i>

1424
01:10:17,692 --> 01:10:18,993
<i>YOU PLAY THE FLUTE?</i>

1425
01:10:19,060 --> 01:10:21,929
YEAH.

1426
01:10:21,997 --> 01:10:23,330
YOU ANY GOOD?

1427
01:10:25,667 --> 01:10:28,736
I'M OKAY.

1428
01:10:28,803 --> 01:10:31,171
YEAH, YOU ARE.

1429
01:10:36,996 --> 01:10:39,998
SO WHAT WAS THAT CONVERSATION
YOU HAD WITH FRANK YESTERDAY?

1430
01:10:41,565 --> 01:10:43,700
THERE'S BEEN QUITE
A LOT GOING ON WITH HIM.

1431
01:10:43,768 --> 01:10:45,068
MM-HMM.

1432
01:10:45,136 --> 01:10:46,603
YOU'VE NOTICED IT TOO?

1433
01:10:46,670 --> 01:10:48,238
WELL, YEAH.
[laughs]

1434
01:10:48,305 --> 01:10:49,305
BUT QUICKLY,

1435
01:10:49,373 --> 01:10:50,707
<i>THE LAST FEW DAYS,</i>

1436
01:10:50,775 --> 01:10:51,975
ONE MINUTE,

1437
01:10:52,043 --> 01:10:53,910
DEPRESSED,
ANGRY AT THE--AT THE CREW.

1438
01:10:53,978 --> 01:10:55,745
THAT'S NOT LIKE HIM, REALLY.

1439
01:10:55,813 --> 01:10:57,380
HE'S VERY LEVEL.

1440
01:10:57,448 --> 01:10:59,983
THE NEXT MINUTE, HE'S UP.
HE'S COMPLETELY HIGH AS A KITE.

1441
01:11:00,051 --> 01:11:02,519
JUST NOW WE SAW HIM.
HE'S...

1442
01:11:02,586 --> 01:11:04,020
<i>[sighs]
WELL, MAYBE HE'S HAPPY.</i>

1443
01:11:04,088 --> 01:11:05,655
<i>I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE HE'S HAPPY.</i>

1444
01:11:05,723 --> 01:11:06,823
<i>I-I HOPE HE'S HAPPY.</i>

1445
01:11:06,891 --> 01:11:08,158
SOMETHING
MIGHT'VE CHEERED HIM UP.

1446
01:11:08,225 --> 01:11:10,493
[sighs]

1447
01:11:10,561 --> 01:11:12,695
I DON'T KNOW,
BUT SOMETHING IS NOT...

1448
01:11:12,763 --> 01:11:14,798
QUITE RIGHT,

1449
01:11:14,865 --> 01:11:16,866
AND I'M NOT SURE
WHAT TO DO ABOUT IT.

1450
01:11:19,003 --> 01:11:21,438
(Jean)
EXCUSE ME, COMMANDER.

1451
01:11:24,442 --> 01:11:25,475
COMMANDER?

1452
01:11:25,543 --> 01:11:27,977
YES?

1453
01:11:28,045 --> 01:11:32,949
THERE'S A CALL FROM JULES
ON THE FLIGHT DECK.

1454
01:11:33,017 --> 01:11:34,451
[beeping]
WE GOT A PROBLEM HERE, BOSS.

1455
01:11:34,518 --> 01:11:35,819
<i>UH, WE RETRACTED THE COMM ARRAY</i>

1456
01:11:35,886 --> 01:11:37,120
<i>SO WE COULD
THOSE AIR-BRAKING TESTS,</i>

1457
01:11:37,188 --> 01:11:38,955
<i>AND NOW IT WON'T DEPLOY AGAIN.</i>

1458
01:11:39,023 --> 01:11:40,323
IT COULD BE A SERVO FAILURE.

1459
01:11:40,391 --> 01:11:41,991
IT COULD BE
A BLOWN POWER SUPPLY,

1460
01:11:42,059 --> 01:11:43,660
BUT I'VE DONE
ALL I CAN FROM HERE.

1461
01:11:43,727 --> 01:11:46,496
<i>SOMEBODY'S GONNA HAVE TO TAKE
A WALK, CHECK IT OUT.</i>

1462
01:11:46,564 --> 01:11:48,965
TELL RIKA, VAL, AND MANNY
TO GRAB THEIR PRESSURE SUITS

1463
01:11:49,033 --> 01:11:50,300
AND MEET IN THE AIRLOCK.

1464
01:11:50,367 --> 01:11:52,368
JULES, YOU'RE IN CHARGE
OF MONITORING THE E.V.A.

1465
01:11:52,436 --> 01:11:53,403
ROGER.

1466
01:11:53,471 --> 01:11:55,038
[beeping]

1467
01:11:55,106 --> 01:11:57,707
[beeping]

1468
01:11:57,775 --> 01:11:59,909
[sighs]

1469
01:12:10,888 --> 01:12:13,957
<i>JULIA CHILD SAYS THAT THE KEY
TO MAKING GREAT SOUFFLE</i>

1470
01:12:14,024 --> 01:12:17,327
IS BEATING OF EGG WHITES
TO FORM AIR BUBBLES THAT EXPAND

1471
01:12:17,394 --> 01:12:18,728
WITH HEAT FROM OVEN, YES?

1472
01:12:18,796 --> 01:12:19,796
OH, RIGHT,
YEAH, I LIKE JULIA.

1473
01:12:19,864 --> 01:12:20,930
SHE CAME
TO OUR SEND-OFF, RIGHT?

1474
01:12:20,998 --> 01:12:22,132
SHE'S THE ONE
THAT BROUGHT ALL THE--

1475
01:12:22,199 --> 01:12:23,266
NO, NO, THAT'S
JULIA CHILDRESS.

1476
01:12:23,334 --> 01:12:26,436
IT'S PROBABLY
A FRIED CIRCUIT BOARD.

1477
01:12:26,504 --> 01:12:28,805
I DESIGN THESE THINGS
TO WITHSTAND A SUB-ZERO VACUUM

1478
01:12:28,873 --> 01:12:29,973
AND EVERY STRESS
KNOWN TO MAN,

1479
01:12:30,040 --> 01:12:31,474
AND THEN
SOME SUIT COMES ALONG,

1480
01:12:31,542 --> 01:12:33,743
CHECKS A BOX, AND FARMS IT
OUT TO THE LOWEST BIDDER.

1481
01:12:33,811 --> 01:12:35,078
YOU THINK
IF THERE'S ONE THING

1482
01:12:35,146 --> 01:12:36,613
THEY WOULDN'T CUT
CORNERS ON, HUH?

1483
01:12:36,680 --> 01:12:39,215
YEAH, NO COMM ARRAY,
NO DATA UPLOADS, NO SHOW,

1484
01:12:39,283 --> 01:12:40,250
NOT THAT I MIND.

1485
01:12:40,317 --> 01:12:41,618
<i>HEY.</i>

1486
01:12:41,685 --> 01:12:43,319
ATLAS, DO YOU WANT A HAND
WITH THAT?

1487
01:12:43,387 --> 01:12:44,854
I CAN MANAGE.

1488
01:12:44,922 --> 01:12:46,222
[laughs]
SURE YOU CAN.

1489
01:12:46,290 --> 01:12:47,357
LIFT IT.

1490
01:12:47,424 --> 01:12:50,827
AH, IT'S HEAVY.

1491
01:12:50,895 --> 01:12:52,295
CAN I ASK YOU
A PERSONAL QUESTION?

1492
01:12:52,363 --> 01:12:54,063
MM-HMM.
ARE YOU GOING NUTS?

1493
01:12:54,131 --> 01:12:57,267
PROBABLY,
BUT WOULD I KNOW IT IF I WERE?

1494
01:12:57,334 --> 01:12:59,002
<i>UH, PROBABLY NOT.
NO.</i>

1495
01:12:59,069 --> 01:13:00,803
<i>FIRST CLUE YOU'D HAVE
WOULD BE US RUSHING AT YOU</i>

1496
01:13:00,871 --> 01:13:03,339
WITH, UH,
ROPES AND A SYRINGE.

1497
01:13:03,407 --> 01:13:06,109
UNTIL THEN, I GUESS YOU'LL ALL
JUST HAVE TO TRUST ME.

1498
01:13:06,177 --> 01:13:09,145
DAMN IT.
THIS THING WON'T RELEASE.

1499
01:13:09,213 --> 01:13:10,547
[grunts]
WELL--

1500
01:13:10,614 --> 01:13:13,149
CAN YOU GET ME A PAIR
OF PLIERS FROM THE LOCKER?

1501
01:13:13,217 --> 01:13:15,685
[breathing heavily]

1502
01:13:15,753 --> 01:13:17,820
YOU'RE NOT SERIOUS.

1503
01:13:19,390 --> 01:13:22,158
NO, CONCERNED.

1504
01:13:22,226 --> 01:13:24,260
AS A MEMBER OF THE CREW--

1505
01:13:24,328 --> 01:13:27,096
I'M FINE.
NOW GET ME THE PLIERS, PLEASE.

1506
01:13:28,866 --> 01:13:29,799
THERE WE GO.

1507
01:13:29,867 --> 01:13:31,534

[beeping]

1510
01:13:36,640 --> 01:13:37,974
ONE OF THESE IS A BACKUP,

1511
01:13:38,042 --> 01:13:39,876
AND ONE OF THEM IS THE ONE
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO--

1512
01:13:39,944 --> 01:13:43,112
LET'S CHECK.
WE HAVE ONE, TWO...

1513
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:44,514
[door closes, locks]

1514
01:13:44,582 --> 01:13:46,649
THIS--DID YOU--

1515
01:13:46,717 --> 01:13:48,918
<i>HEY.</i>

1516
01:13:48,986 --> 01:13:50,987
HEY.

1517
01:13:51,055 --> 01:13:52,422
VERY FUNNY.
WHO'S THE JOKER?

1518
01:13:52,489 --> 01:13:54,224
SO DO YOU, UH, WANT--

1519
01:13:55,793 --> 01:13:56,893
OPEN THE DOOR IF YOU WANT IT.

1520
01:13:56,961 --> 01:13:58,161
ALL RIGHT,
SERIOUSLY, COMMANDER.

1521
01:13:58,229 --> 01:14:00,129
SORRY.
SO OPEN THE DOOR.

TRIPPED THE OUTER-HATCH RELEASE.

JIMMY, JIMMY.

1536
01:14:25,990 --> 01:14:27,457
I'M AHEAD OF YOU.
IT'S COMING, IT'S COMING.

1537
01:14:27,524 --> 01:14:28,825

DON'T SHOUT!

1540
01:14:30,861 --> 01:14:32,962
OPEN THE DOOR, JEAN!

1541
01:14:33,030 --> 01:14:34,530

THE OUTER DOOR
IS NOW OPENING.
