SO THIS IS IT.

1015
01:00:32,496 --> 01:00:34,630
THIS IS WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT.

1016
01:00:34,632 --> 01:00:36,898

IT'S BUSINESS...

1022
01:01:08,465 --> 01:01:10,098

1023
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:13,568
CAN YOU TAKE ME BACK
TO CAMP?

1024
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:19,341
MEGHAN, SO,
I SPOKE TO A GUY

1025
01:01:19,343 --> 01:01:20,042
OUT AT GOD'S COUNTRY,

1026
01:01:20,044 --> 01:01:23,779
AND HE SAID THAT A MEGHAN
DOUBTFIRE WITH A FERRARI

1027
01:01:23,781 --> 01:01:26,848
HAS BEEN OUT THERE
FOR THE PAST FIVE DAYS.

1028
01:01:26,850 --> 01:01:29,785
SO WHAT'S GOIN' ON?

1029
01:01:29,787 --> 01:01:31,787
WHAT HAVE THEY DONE TO YOU?

1030
01:01:31,789 --> 01:01:34,089
LOOK, I DON'T CARE
ABOUT THE YAKAMOTO DEAL.

1031
01:01:34,091 --> 01:01:38,226
BUT IF I DON'T HEAR FROM YOU
BY THE END OF THE AUCTION,

1032
01:01:38,228 --> 01:01:39,127
I'M CALLING THE POLICE.

1033
01:01:39,129 --> 01:01:40,829
SO WHAT DO YOU DO
FOR A LIVING?

1034
01:01:40,831 --> 01:01:46,568
- I'M IN REAL ESTATE.
- OH, REAL ESTATE.
THAT SOUNDS INTERESTING.

1035
01:01:46,570 --> 01:01:47,402
I WANT TO MAJOR
IN CIVIL LAW.

1036
01:01:47,404 --> 01:01:51,173
MY FATHER'S A LAWYER, SO
I GET TO SEE HOW HE HELPS
PEOPLE OUT OF TIGHT SPOTS.

1037
01:01:51,175 --> 01:01:55,577
I CAN NEVER SEE YOU
AS A PERSON WHO WOULD
MAJOR IN LAW.

1038
01:01:55,579 --> 01:02:02,150
WHY, 'CAUSE I'M NOT
ALL GLAMOROUS LIKE YOU?

1039
01:02:02,152 --> 01:02:04,419
I ALWAYS WANTED TO FIT IN
WITH THE GIRLS, YOU KNOW.

1040
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:06,955
IT'S JUST, I HAVE
FOUR BROTHERS.

1041
01:02:06,957 --> 01:02:09,391
IT'S JUST EASIER
TO PLAY ROUGH, YOU NOW?

1042
01:02:09,393 --> 01:02:14,262
I HAVE AN IDEA. LISTEN,
WHY DON'T YOU COME
TO LOS ANGELES

1043
01:02:14,264 --> 01:02:16,198
FOR A WEEKEND WITH ME?

1044
01:02:16,200 --> 01:02:16,598
REALLY?

1045
01:02:16,600 --> 01:02:21,470
YEAH, WE CAN,
WE CAN GO SHOPPING,

1046
01:02:21,472 --> 01:02:22,838
AND--

1047
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:29,845
WE COULD FIND YOU A NEW
HAIR STYLE.

1048
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:35,684
HOW DOES THAT SOUND?
WE COULD HAVE SOME GIRL TIME?

1049
01:02:35,686 --> 01:02:37,886
YOU KNOW, JUST DO
A BUNCH OF GIRL THINGS.

1050
01:02:37,888 --> 01:02:39,721
I WOULD LIKE THAT.

1051
01:02:39,723 --> 01:02:40,455
YEAH?

1052
01:02:40,457 --> 01:02:41,656
SOUNDS LIKE
SOMETHING MY MOTHER

1053
01:02:41,658 --> 01:02:43,258
AND I WOULD
HAVE DONE TOGETHER.

1054
01:02:43,260 --> 01:02:44,626
OH. WHERE'S YOUR MOTHER?

1055
01:02:44,628 --> 01:02:47,395
SHE DIED LAST YEAR.

1056
01:02:48,431 --> 01:02:50,465
I'M SORRY.

1057
01:02:50,467 --> 01:02:55,170
MY FATHER DIED WHEN
I WAS ABOUT YOUR AGE.

1058
01:02:55,172 --> 01:02:57,806
I DID EVERYTHING
WITH HIM, AND THEN

1059
01:02:57,808 --> 01:03:00,208
WHEN HE DIED I JUST LOST
INTEREST IN EVERYTHING.

1060
01:03:00,210 --> 01:03:06,181
HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU SEEM
TOO NICE TO BE A LAWYER.

1061
01:03:06,183 --> 01:03:08,450
ALL THE LAWYERS I KNOW
ARE JUST RUTHLESS.

1062
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:11,186
THERE'S GOOD AND BAD IN
EVERYTHING AND EVERYONE.

1063
01:03:11,188 --> 01:03:12,921
I WANT TO BE A LAWYER
SO I CAN--

1064
01:03:12,923 --> 01:03:17,692
SO I CAN FIGHT FOR
THE PEOPLE THAT CAN'T AFFORD
TO FIGHT FOR THEMSELVES.

1065
01:03:17,694 --> 01:03:18,760
YOU KNOW, FOR EXAMPLE,

1066
01:03:18,762 --> 01:03:21,630
SAY THERE'S THIS BIG BANK
THAT LOCKS AN ELDERLY COUPLE
INTO A BAD MORTGAGE,

1067
01:03:21,632 --> 01:03:27,169
AND THEN TRIES TO EVICT THEM
FROM THEIR HOME FOR THE MONEY
'CAUSE THEY'RE GREEDY.

1068
01:03:27,171 --> 01:03:29,371
THAT'S WHEN I WOULD SWOOP IN--

MR. WHITAKER DIDN'T SEND ME
DOWN HERE JUST
TO MAKE AN OFFER.

1091

TO DEVELOP THE LAND.

INTO A CASINO AND RESORT.

IT'S A $100 MILLION DEAL
AND I DON'T SEE ANY WAY

1095

THAT YOU COULD STOP IT
FROM HAPPENING,

1096
01:06:01,925 --> 01:06:06,761

IS THE AUCTION.

1097

BUT YOU HAVE TO BE PROACTIVE.

1108
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:39,461
JAKE SHARED WITH ME THE ENTIRE
VISION YOU HAVE TO BUILD
A CHRISTIAN COLLEGE.

1109
01:06:39,463 --> 01:06:41,429
YOU'VE GOT TO FIND SOMEONE
TO INVEST IN IT,

1110
01:06:41,431 --> 01:06:45,166

TO BUY THIS
LAND SO YOU CAN PUT THIS CAMP

I'VE CALLED EVERYONE
I KNOW WITH MONEY

1112

THAT COULD MAYBE BAIL ME OUT,
BUT SO FAR, NO ONE.

AND EVERYONE ELSE?

1116
01:07:04,186 --> 01:07:04,786
JAKE TRUSTS YOU.

I'M GONNA TELL MY FAMILY
TONIGHT.

1120
01:07:24,374 --> 01:07:28,443
IT'S NOT FAIR T HIDE THINGS

1121
01:07:28,445 --> 01:07:30,245
IT'S JUST NOT FAIR.

1122

1123
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:32,680
OKAY.
YOU'RE RIGHT.

1124
01:07:32,682 --> 01:07:35,850
