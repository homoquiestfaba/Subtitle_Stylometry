00:05:54,915 --> 00:05:56,657
Okay, here we go.

8
00:05:56,692 --> 00:05:57,846
Focus.

9
00:05:57,881 --> 00:06:01,166
Speed. I am speed.

10
00:06:03,431 --> 00:06:05,690
One winner.
Fourty-two losers.

11
00:06:05,725 --> 00:06:08,369
I eat losers for breakfast.

12
00:06:10,928 --> 00:06:13,936
Breakfast. Maybe I should have breakfast.

13
00:06:13,971 --> 00:06:15,607
Brakie could be good for me.

14
00:06:15,642 --> 00:06:16,798
No, no. Stay focused.

15
00:06:16,833 --> 00:06:17,861
Speed.

16
00:06:19,837 --> 00:06:21,665
I'm faster than fast,
quicker than quick.

17
00:06:21,700 --> 00:06:23,438
I am Lightning!

18
00:06:24,535 --> 00:06:26,392
Hey Lightning, you're ready?

19
00:06:28,604 --> 00:06:30,080
LIGHTNING McQUEEN

20
00:06:30,222 --> 00:06:31,571
Oh yeah, Lightning is ready!

Not bad run, sweetie!

25
00:08:39,575 --> 00:08:42,133
Welcome back to the Dinoco 400.

26
00:08:42,168 --> 00:08:45,289
I'm Bob Cutlass. Here with
my good friend Darrell Cartrip.

27
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:49,075
We're midway through what may turn
out to be a historic day of a racing.

28
00:08:49,110 --> 00:08:50,945
I'm all fresh with student Ruth right now.

29
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,297
If this gets any more exciting, they're
gonna have to toll me out of the booth!

30
00:08:54,332 --> 00:08:55,493
Right you are, Darrell.

31
00:08:55,528 --> 00:08:58,270
Three cars are tied for
the season's point sleeve.

32
00:08:58,305 --> 00:09:00,123
Heading into the final race of the season.

33
00:09:00,158 --> 00:09:03,250
And the winner of this race,
Darrell will win the season's title.

34
00:09:03,285 --> 00:09:05,075
And the Piston Cup.

35
00:09:05,110 --> 00:09:09,590
Of the cage Strip Weathers have
one more victory before retiring.

36
00:09:09,625 --> 00:09:11,883
He's been down to coast
golden boy for years!

37
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,295
Can he win the one last Piston Cup?

38
00:09:14,330 --> 00:09:16,049
And there's always
for the second place.

39
00:09:16,084 --> 00:09:17,912
Bob, we're buying Chick Hicks.

40
00:09:17,947 --> 00:09:20,751
He's been shaking that tail
then his entire career.

41
00:09:20,786 --> 00:09:22,661
Chick tough this was his year, Bob.

42
00:09:22,696 --> 00:09:25,401
He's chance to finally emerge
to the Kind Shadow.

43
00:09:25,436 --> 00:09:27,399
But the last thing he expected was...

44
00:09:28,123 --> 00:09:29,858
Lightning McQueen!

45
00:09:29,893 --> 00:09:32,207
You know, I don't think
anybody expected this.

46
00:09:32,242 --> 00:09:34,897
Rookie sensation came in
at the season unknown.

47
00:09:34,932 --> 00:09:36,676
But everyone knows him now.

48
00:09:36,711 --> 00:09:39,174
Will he be the first rookie to win Piston Cup?

49
00:09:39,209 --> 00:09:40,601
And land Dinoco?

50
00:09:40,829 --> 00:09:43,403
The legend, the runner up and the rookie!

51
00:09:43,438 --> 00:09:45,929
Three cars, one champion!

52
00:10:15,338 --> 00:10:16,555
Go get him!

53
00:10:22,954 --> 00:10:24,262
Dinoco is all mine.

54
00:10:27,912 --> 00:10:28,920
Get through that, McQueen!

55
00:10:29,255 --> 00:10:30,862
Huge crash! Unbelievable!

56
00:10:53,435 --> 00:10:55,581
Wait a second Darrell,
McQueen is in the rackage.

57
00:10:55,616 --> 00:10:57,625
There's no way that rookie
can make it through!

58
00:10:57,660 --> 00:10:59,309
Not one piece that is.

59
00:11:15,510 --> 00:11:17,032
Lightning!

60
00:11:20,275 --> 00:11:21,803
Look at him!
McQueen made it through!

61
00:11:21,838 --> 00:11:24,832
Man, a spectacular move
by Lightning McQueen!

62
00:11:24,867 --> 00:11:26,489
Yeah! Good jump!

63
00:11:27,235 --> 00:11:29,673
McQueen! McQueen!
McQueen! McQueen!

64
00:11:30,414 --> 00:11:33,124
Yeah McQueen! Gotchaaa!

65
00:11:33,799 --> 00:11:36,620
Everyone else heads for the
pimps but McQueen stays out.

66
00:11:36,655 --> 00:11:37,770
To take it for lead!

67
00:11:37,805 --> 00:11:40,737
Don't pick me out,
I can still race!

68
00:11:45,787 --> 00:11:48,054
Ha, what do you think, boys?
What a beauty.

69
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:49,612
- McQueen made it through!
- What?

70
00:11:49,647 --> 00:11:50,822
He's got pidding!

71
00:11:50,857 --> 00:11:53,918
Go! Get me out of here, let's go!
Get me back up there, come on!

72
00:11:53,953 --> 00:11:56,301
McQueen not going into the pits.

73
00:11:56,336 --> 00:11:57,853
You know the rookie
just fired his crutie.

74
00:11:57,888 --> 00:11:59,751
That's the third one this season.

75
00:11:59,786 --> 00:12:01,494
Well, he says he likes
working alone, Darrell.

76
00:12:02,250 --> 00:12:04,413
It looks like Shet got
caught up in the pits.

77
00:12:04,448 --> 00:12:07,892
Yeah, after a start like that he's
got a lot of ground to make up!

78
00:12:07,927 --> 00:12:10,124
Get ready boys, we're
coming into the restart.

79
00:12:28,607 --> 00:12:29,857
Come on, come on, come on!

80
00:12:38,705 --> 00:12:40,619
We need tires down!
Come on, let's go!

81
00:12:40,654 --> 00:12:42,744
No, no, no!
No tires! Just gas!

82
00:12:43,769 --> 00:12:45,561
You need tires, you idiot!

83
00:12:45,596 --> 00:12:48,285
Looks like it's all gas and
goes for McQueen today.

84
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:50,106
That's right, no tires again.

85
00:12:50,141 --> 00:12:52,950
Normally I'd say after a short
term game long term walk.

86
00:12:52,985 --> 00:12:54,646
But it sure is working for him.

87
00:12:54,681 --> 00:12:56,525
Hey, maybe he knows
something we don't know.

88
00:13:05,339 --> 00:13:09,155
This is it Darrell. One lap to go and
Lightning McQueen has a huge lead.

89
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:12,428
Ah, he's gotten into the bay,
calling it nose, put down a fire.

90
00:13:12,463 --> 00:13:13,980
We knew it grab us a new chase.

91
00:13:21,088 --> 00:13:22,590
Checker flag, here I come!

92
00:13:22,911 --> 00:13:25,604
Oh no! McQueen has blown the tire!

93
00:13:25,639 --> 00:13:28,351
In beholding one time to go,
can he make it?

94
00:13:28,386 --> 00:13:29,400
You fool!

95
00:13:32,025 --> 00:13:33,968
McQueen blew a tire,
McQueen blew a tire!

96
00:13:45,587 --> 00:13:46,963
He's lost another tire!

97
00:13:46,998 --> 00:13:50,106
- McQueen checkers coming up fast.
- They are in term three.

98
00:13:50,141 --> 00:13:51,316
Come on!

99
00:13:54,161 --> 00:13:55,804
I don't believe what I'm watching, Bob!

100
00:13:56,942 --> 00:13:59,696
Lightning McQueen is a hundred
feet from his Piston Cup!

101
00:14:06,302 --> 00:14:07,991
The King and Chick rounding turn four.

102
00:14:11,329 --> 00:14:13,414
The Piston Cup and it's.. And it's...

103
00:14:14,671 --> 00:14:17,410
- It's too close to call!
- I don't believe it!

104
00:14:20,264 --> 00:14:25,501
The most spectacular, amazing,
unbelievable in the history of a world!

105
00:14:25,536 --> 00:14:27,559
And we don't even know who won!

106
00:14:41,504 --> 00:14:43,559
Hey no cameras!
Get out of here!

107
00:14:43,594 --> 00:14:46,371
We're here in Victory Lane
awaiting the race results.

108
00:14:46,406 --> 00:14:49,021
McQueen, that was quite a
risky move not taking the tires.

109
00:14:49,056 --> 00:14:49,831
Tell me about it.

110
00:14:49,866 --> 00:14:51,739
Are you sorry you don't
have a crutchie out there?

111
00:14:52,906 --> 00:14:55,901
Kori, there's a lot more
to racing than just winning.

112
00:14:55,936 --> 00:14:59,900
I mean taking a race by a full lap,
where's the entertainment then?

113
00:14:59,935 --> 00:15:02,254
No, no, I want to give
the falks a little sizzle.

114
00:15:02,289 --> 00:15:02,947
Sizzle?

115
00:15:02,982 --> 00:15:04,176
Am I sorry I don't have a crutchie?

116
00:15:04,211 --> 00:15:06,228
No, I'm not. Cause I'm a one man show.

117
00:15:06,405 --> 00:15:07,806
What? Yeah right.

118
00:15:08,063 --> 00:15:09,883
That was a very confident
Lightning McQueen.

119
00:15:09,918 --> 00:15:12,339
Coming to you live from Victory Lane.

120
00:15:12,374 --> 00:15:13,835
Hey, get out of the shot!

121
00:15:13,870 --> 00:15:16,374
Yo, Chuck! Chuck what are you doing,
you're blocking the camera!

122
00:15:16,409 --> 00:15:18,065
Everyone wants to see the bulb.

123
00:15:18,100 --> 00:15:19,148
- What?
- Now back away.

124
00:15:19,897 --> 00:15:21,541
That's it! Come on, guys!

125
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:26,417
- Wow! Jee! Where are you going?
- We quit, Mr. One Man Show!

126
00:15:26,452 --> 00:15:27,994
Okay, leave. Fine.

127
00:15:28,776 --> 00:15:32,472
How will I ever find anyone else
who knows how to fill me up with gas?

128
00:15:33,142 --> 00:15:34,297
Adios, Chuck.

129
00:15:34,332 --> 00:15:37,099
- And my name is not Chuck!
- Oh, whatever.

130
00:15:37,826 --> 00:15:39,630
Hey Lightning!
Yo, McQueen!

131
00:15:39,665 --> 00:15:42,976
Seriously, that was some pretty
darn nice racing out there.

132
00:15:43,011 --> 00:15:44,309
By me!

133
00:15:46,135 --> 00:15:47,730
Welcome to the Chicker, baby.

134
00:15:47,765 --> 00:15:49,800
Piston Cup, it's mine, dude.

135
00:15:50,527 --> 00:15:53,772
Hey fellows, how do you think
I'd look in Dinoco blue?

136
00:15:53,807 --> 00:15:55,052
Dinoco blue!

137
00:15:55,988 --> 00:15:58,181
- In your dreams, Thunder.
- Yeah, right!

138
00:15:58,216 --> 00:16:00,044
Dundru, why's he talking about thunder?

139
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:03,110
You know, cause thunder
always comes after Lightning!

140
00:16:04,904 --> 00:16:07,737
- Who here knew about the thunder?
- I didn't.

141
00:16:10,047 --> 00:16:10,846
Show us some boo!

142
00:16:22,225 --> 00:16:26,906
Ladies, that was one close finish.
You sure made Dinoco proud.

143
00:16:26,941 --> 00:16:28,153
Thank you Kenny. Reflection.

144
00:16:28,188 --> 00:16:30,173
You've been good to me all these years.

145
00:16:30,208 --> 00:16:31,742
There's a late stock in this.

146
00:16:31,777 --> 00:16:34,652
Whatever happened, you're a winner
to me, you old getty rabbit.

147
00:16:34,687 --> 00:16:37,425
Thanks dear.
We'll mean that in that tune.

148
00:16:40,787 --> 00:16:42,174
- I'm Mia!
- I'm Tia!

149
00:16:42,209 --> 00:16:44,223
We're like your biggest fans!

150
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:48,177
I love being me.

151
00:16:49,158 --> 00:16:51,359
We love you Lightning!

152
00:16:53,564 --> 00:16:56,412
Hey buddy, you're a one
good some gracious.

153
00:16:56,447 --> 00:16:57,891
Hey Mr. Lukane.

154
00:16:57,926 --> 00:17:02,428
You got more talent in one lugn, that
a lot of corners has got in whole body.

155
00:17:02,463 --> 00:17:04,721
- Really? Oh, that's...
- That's you're stupid.

156
00:17:04,756 --> 00:17:05,851
Excuse me?

157
00:17:05,886 --> 00:17:08,925
This ain't a one man deal, kid.
You ain't a wize up.

158
00:17:08,960 --> 00:17:11,533
You get yourself a good
crutchie on a good thing.

159
00:17:11,568 --> 00:17:14,340
You ain't gonna win unless
you got good falks behind you.

160
00:17:14,375 --> 00:17:17,042
And you let them very
top like a computer...

161
00:17:19,018 --> 00:17:21,884
Crutchie, yeah.

162
00:17:25,534 --> 00:17:26,907
THE NEW FACE OF DINOCO

163
00:17:26,942 --> 00:17:27,966
THE KING

164
00:17:28,001 --> 00:17:28,891
LIGHTNING McQUEEN

165
00:17:54,813 --> 00:17:57,637
You figure that out,
you're just going to be okay.

166
00:17:57,672 --> 00:18:02,512
Oh, that is spectacular advice.
Thank you Mr. The King.

167
00:18:03,337 --> 00:18:07,350
Ladies and gentlemen, for the
first time in Piston Cup history...

168
00:18:07,385 --> 00:18:10,875
And rookie got won the Piston Cup.

169
00:18:11,627 --> 00:18:12,310
Yes!

170
00:18:12,345 --> 00:18:14,848
We have a three way cars!

171
00:18:22,828 --> 00:18:26,145
Hey McQueen, that must be really embarracing,
but I wouldn't worry about it.

172
00:18:26,180 --> 00:18:27,517
Because I didn't do it!

173
00:18:28,853 --> 00:18:31,963
It's the turn out high wagger race

174
00:18:31,998 --> 00:18:36,221
between the three leaders will be
held in California in one week.

175
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:39,947
Well thank you, thanks
all of you there. Thanks you.

176
00:18:39,982 --> 00:18:43,826
Hey, rook. First one to California
gets Dinoco autum sulk.

177
00:18:43,861 --> 00:18:46,664
Ah! No, not me! No, you rock!
And you know that!

178
00:18:51,396 --> 00:18:52,890
Oh yeah! Wow!

179
00:18:56,458 --> 00:18:59,654
First one to California
gets Dinoco all-do-himself.

180
00:18:59,689 --> 00:19:02,499
We'll see who gets there first, Chick.

181
00:19:03,561 --> 00:19:07,658
- Hey kid, congrats on a time!
- I don't wanna talk about it.

182
00:19:07,693 --> 00:19:08,934
Come on, let's go Mack. Settle up.

183
00:19:08,969 --> 00:19:10,166
What did you do with my trailer?

184
00:19:10,201 --> 00:19:12,900
- I parked it over here his boss's tit.
- What?

185
00:19:12,935 --> 00:19:17,345
- You gotta make your first of appearance.
- No. No. No, no, no, no!

186
00:19:17,380 --> 00:19:19,827
Yes, yes, yes!
Lightning McQueen here.

187
00:19:19,862 --> 00:19:23,220
And I use a Rust-eze, medicated bumper
ointment, new rear in formula.

188
00:19:23,255 --> 00:19:26,795
Nothing sues a Rusty bumper like Rust-eze!

189
00:19:28,044 --> 00:19:28,912
Actual results may take up to 36 weeks.

190
00:19:28,947 --> 00:19:30,114
Wow! Look at that shine!

191
00:19:30,149 --> 00:19:33,821
Use Rust-eze, and you
too can look like me!

192
00:19:38,299 --> 00:19:40,463
I covered the scot for scotskin.

193
00:19:40,498 --> 00:19:43,360
He was so Rust-eze
he didn't cash a check!

194
00:19:44,453 --> 00:19:46,133
You can see his dirty undercarriage.

195
00:19:47,647 --> 00:19:50,970
I hate rusty cars.
This is not good for my image.

196
00:19:51,005 --> 00:19:54,471
They did gave you a big break.
Besides, it's in your contract.

197
00:19:54,506 --> 00:19:57,241
Will you stop please!
Just go get hottop.

198
00:19:57,276 --> 00:20:01,424
- Winter is a grand old time.
- Of this there are no 'ifs' or 'buts'.

199
00:20:01,459 --> 00:20:05,891
- But remember, all that soltan grind.
- Can rust your bolts and freeze your...

200
00:20:05,926 --> 00:20:07,413
Hey look, there he is!

201
00:20:08,287 --> 00:20:11,519
Our almost there!
Get you rearranded here kid.

202
00:20:11,554 --> 00:20:16,108
- Lucky McQueen, you are wicked ass!
- Yeah you are funky, McQueen!

203
00:20:16,143 --> 00:20:18,633
- Give me a little room, guys.
- You're my hero, Mr. McQueen!

204
00:20:18,668 --> 00:20:24,051
- Yes, I know. Frank, thank you.
- He knows my name! He knows my name!

205
00:20:24,779 --> 00:20:26,439
Look at that, body!

206
00:20:26,474 --> 00:20:29,045
Lightning, we had a better year.

207
00:20:29,080 --> 00:20:32,087
I mean we may even clear it up
to buy you some headlights.

208
00:20:32,122 --> 00:20:36,160
- Are you saying he doesn't have headlights?
- That's what I'm telling you! It's just stickers!

209
00:20:36,195 --> 00:20:41,419
Well you know, race cars don't need headlights,
because the track is always lit.

210
00:20:41,454 --> 00:20:43,850
So is my brother but he still needs headlights!

211
00:20:49,783 --> 00:20:53,332
Ladies and gentlemen, Lightning McQueen!

212
00:20:58,136 --> 00:21:03,442
You know the Rust-eze medicated bumper
ointment team ran a great race today.

213
00:21:03,477 --> 00:21:08,106
And remember, with a little
Rust-eze and cinema lock

214
00:21:08,141 --> 00:21:10,660
you too can look like me.

215
00:21:16,221 --> 00:21:20,838
We love it. And we're looking towards
to another great year, just like this year.

216
00:21:22,243 --> 00:21:24,452
Not on your life.

217
00:21:25,528 --> 00:21:28,397
- Don't drive like my brother!
- Don't drive like my brother!

218
00:21:28,940 --> 00:21:31,542
California, here we come!

219
00:21:31,577 --> 00:21:34,268
Dinoco, here we come!

220
00:23:25,329 --> 00:23:29,098
Ooh, I need this. Hello?

221
00:23:29,133 --> 00:23:32,041
Is this Lightning McQueen the
world's fastest racing machine?

222
00:23:32,076 --> 00:23:36,344
- Is this Harv, the world's greatest agent?
- And it is such an honour to be your agent.

223
00:23:36,379 --> 00:23:38,958
That almost hurts me to
take 10 percent of your winning.

224
00:23:38,993 --> 00:23:41,812
And merchandising and right and property.

225
00:23:41,847 --> 00:23:44,876
Anyway, what a race! Ha, champ?

226
00:23:44,911 --> 00:23:47,351
I didn't see it but I heard you were great.

227
00:23:47,386 --> 00:23:50,886
- Thanks Harv.
- Listen, they're giving you 20 tickets

228
00:23:50,921 --> 00:23:53,740
for the tie breaker in Cally.
I'll pass them on to your friends.

229
00:23:53,775 --> 00:23:54,963
You shoot me the names.

230
00:23:54,998 --> 00:23:56,887
You let hard rocking for you, all right baby?

231
00:23:56,922 --> 00:23:59,717
Right, friends! Yes, there's...

232
00:24:02,513 --> 00:24:06,148
Okay, I get it Mr. Popular so many friends
you can't even near right that.

233
00:24:06,183 --> 00:24:09,411
Hey, when you get to town, you better
make time for your best friend.

234
00:24:09,446 --> 00:24:13,572
- You gotta break brake with Spooky here.
- Yeah, that would be great! We should totally...

235
00:24:13,607 --> 00:24:16,644
Okay, I gotta jump kid, let me
know how it goes. I'm out.

236
00:24:20,750 --> 00:24:22,957
What? A minivan?

237
00:24:23,568 --> 00:24:27,313
Come on, Mack. He's gonna slow me,
Lightning McQueen you're holding here!

238
00:24:27,348 --> 00:24:31,346
Yes, stop it all brick brick kid.
Poor Mack needs a rest.

239
00:24:31,381 --> 00:24:34,061
Absolutely not. We're driving
straight through all night.

240
00:24:34,096 --> 00:24:36,292
Then we get to California.
We can win through it!

241
00:24:36,327 --> 00:24:40,479
All night! Why don't you
spend a real deal, estate.

242
00:24:40,514 --> 00:24:43,405
Come on Mack, I need to get there
before Chick and hand with Dinoco.

243
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:48,487
All those sleeping trucks.
Hey kid, I don't know if I can make it.

244
00:24:48,522 --> 00:24:50,887
Oh sure you can, Mack.
Look, it'll be easy.

245
00:24:50,922 --> 00:24:53,286
- I'll stay up with you.
- All night?

246
00:24:53,321 --> 00:24:54,841
All night long.

247
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,050
- Hey yo, DJ!
- What up?

248
00:26:16,085 --> 00:26:18,567
We got ourselves a nodder.

249
00:26:26,141 --> 00:26:28,764
Pretty music!

250
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:32,633
Yo we go! Lane's changed, Mack!

251
00:26:32,668 --> 00:26:34,201
Right by get ya!

252
00:26:35,292 --> 00:26:38,137
- Oops! I missed!
- You go on vacation?

253
00:26:58,282 --> 00:27:01,103
- Oh no, it's Snotrod.
- He's gonna blow!

254
00:27:06,010 --> 00:27:08,946
Once a mere drive went lousy.

255
00:27:28,957 --> 00:27:30,240
Mack!

256
00:27:36,413 --> 00:27:37,188
Mack!

257
00:27:43,950 --> 00:27:46,140
Mack! Hey Mack!

258
00:27:46,838 --> 00:27:47,547
Mack!

259
00:27:49,678 --> 00:27:50,626
Mack!

260
00:27:51,434 --> 00:27:52,423
Mack wait for me!

261
00:28:02,487 --> 00:28:03,498
Mack!

262
00:28:24,902 --> 00:28:26,308
Mack! Mack!

263
00:28:29,326 --> 00:28:31,800
Mack! Mack, wait up!

264
00:28:33,015 --> 00:28:34,766
Mack, Mack!

265
00:28:37,212 --> 00:28:39,875
- You're not Mack!
- Mack?

266
00:28:39,910 --> 00:28:43,737
I ain't no Mack,
I'm a Peterbuilt Red Sack!

267
00:28:43,772 --> 00:28:46,250
Turn on your lights, you moron!

268
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:53,595
Mack... The innerstate!

269
00:28:57,642 --> 00:28:59,413
ROUTE 66

270
00:29:08,602 --> 00:29:11,220
Not in my town, you dumb.

271
00:29:15,756 --> 00:29:19,307
Oh, no! Oh, maybe he can help me!

272
00:29:20,346 --> 00:29:22,283
Why is he shooting at me?
Why is he shooting at me!

273
00:29:23,950 --> 00:29:25,690
I haven't gone this fast in years.

274
00:29:26,662 --> 00:29:28,628
I'm gonna boo a gasket or something.

275
00:29:31,240 --> 00:29:34,266
What the ballo blazers
crazy hotrunner!

276
00:30:35,699 --> 00:30:40,363
I'm telling you man,
every third blink is slower.

277
00:30:44,712 --> 00:30:46,834
The 60s weren't good to you, were they?

278
00:30:57,206 --> 00:30:59,771
What? That's not the interstate!

279
00:31:09,743 --> 00:31:10,816
No, no, no, no, no, no!

280
00:31:15,352 --> 00:31:18,167
I'm not the only one seeing this, right?

281
00:32:12,373 --> 00:32:15,692
Fly away Stanley! Be free!

282
00:32:25,208 --> 00:32:28,533
Boy, you're in a heap of trouble.

283
00:32:31,809 --> 00:32:34,476
We're live at the Los Angeles
International Speedway

284
00:32:34,511 --> 00:32:38,580
as the first competitor, winky
McQueen is arriving at the track!

285
00:32:39,412 --> 00:32:42,348
- Is it true he's gonna pumch ricardo?
- What's your strategy?

286
00:32:45,075 --> 00:32:47,487
Come on, do not forget
to wipe my munklabs.

287
00:32:47,522 --> 00:32:49,045
LIGHTNING McQUEEN MISSING

288
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:52,383
McQueen's driver ride in California,
but McQueen was missing.

289
00:32:52,418 --> 00:32:54,266
Race car, Lightning McQueen
was appointed missing.

290
00:32:54,409 --> 00:32:54,975
MISSING

291
00:32:55,287 --> 00:32:56,153
Scheduled race in
an unprecedent...

292
00:32:56,188 --> 00:32:58,966
Spots have stated.
They have no idea where he is.

293
00:33:02,093 --> 00:33:05,282
I just hope Lightning is okay. I sure would hate
to see anything bad happens to him.

294
00:33:05,317 --> 00:33:09,311
I don't know what target to fun, Lightning McQueen
or cruchie who worked with him!

295
00:33:09,346 --> 00:33:12,708
Lightning McQueen must be found at all costs.

296
00:33:12,743 --> 00:33:16,417
They are all asking the same
question, where is McQueen?

297
00:33:20,805 --> 00:33:22,140
Where am I?

298
00:33:23,253 --> 00:33:24,865
Morning, slave admittee!

299
00:33:26,685 --> 00:33:29,110
More Hollywooding
when you're away kid!

300
00:33:29,145 --> 00:33:31,244
Take whatever you want,
just don't hurt me!

301
00:33:32,855 --> 00:33:34,926
Parking? Why do I have a parking midle?

302
00:33:34,961 --> 00:33:36,444
What's going on here please!

303
00:33:38,792 --> 00:33:41,335
You're funny, I like you already.

304
00:33:41,370 --> 00:33:42,880
My name's Mater.

305
00:33:44,117 --> 00:33:45,279
Mater?

306
00:33:45,314 --> 00:33:48,523
Yeah, like domater but without a 'DO'!

307
00:33:48,558 --> 00:33:51,667
- What's your name?
- You don't know my name?

308
00:33:51,702 --> 00:33:56,293
No, I'm not. Is your name Mater too?

309
00:33:56,328 --> 00:34:00,841
What? Look, I need to get
to California as fast as possible.

310
00:34:00,876 --> 00:34:03,464
- Where am I?
- Where are you?

311
00:34:04,545 --> 00:34:09,777
You're in Radiator Springs, the cuttest
little town in Carburetor county.

312
00:34:09,812 --> 00:34:12,591
Oh, great. Just great!

313
00:34:12,626 --> 00:34:16,832
Well, if you think that's great,
you should see the rest of the town.

314
00:34:17,455 --> 00:34:21,093
You know, I'd love to
see the rest of the town!

315
00:34:21,128 --> 00:34:23,882
So if you could just open
the gate, take this boot off.

316
00:34:23,917 --> 00:34:27,139
You and me we go cruise and
check out the local scene, you know.

317
00:34:27,174 --> 00:34:29,438
- Yeah! Good!
- How's that for you, Mater?

318
00:34:29,473 --> 00:34:33,695
Mater! What did I tell you
about talking to the accused?

319
00:34:33,730 --> 00:34:35,272
To not to.

320
00:34:35,307 --> 00:34:39,659
What creet you're yapping totally is doing
what road has it dedtraffic course.

321
00:34:39,694 --> 00:34:41,381
We'll talk later, mater.

322
00:34:42,874 --> 00:34:44,874
Later mater, that's funny!

323
00:34:46,465 --> 00:34:49,753
The Radiator Springs Traffic Court,

You brought the road!
I know that about the cars!

326
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,861

327
00:34:59,896 --> 00:35:02,706
- I gotta get to California pronto.
- Where's your lawyer?

328
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,192
I don't know. Tahiti maybe.
He's gotta timeshare there.

329
00:35:06,227 --> 00:35:10,629
When a defendant has no lawyer,
the court will assign one to him.

330
00:35:10,664 --> 00:35:13,208
Hey! Anyone wanna be his lawyer?

331
00:35:15,745 --> 00:35:18,766
- Hold on, Sheriff!
- All rise.

332
00:35:18,801 --> 00:35:20,992
The honourable Doc Hudson reside of.

333
00:35:21,027 --> 00:35:22,660
Chill off.

334
00:35:22,695 --> 00:35:25,770
May Doc have mercy on your soul.

335
00:35:27,219 --> 00:35:30,456
All right, I wanna know who's responsible
for reckoning my town, Sheriff.

336
00:35:30,491 --> 00:35:34,174
I want this hoot on a platter.
I'm gonna put him in jail till he rots.

337
00:35:34,209 --> 00:35:38,037
Check that, I'm gonna put him
in jail till the jail rots,

338
00:35:38,072 --> 00:35:41,002
on top of the Mandella while
we move him to a new jail,

339
00:35:41,037 --> 00:35:43,930
and when that jail rot,
I'm gonna...

340
00:35:46,179 --> 00:35:48,002
Throw him out of here Sheriff.

341
00:35:48,037 --> 00:35:51,243
I want him out of my courtroom,
I want him out of my town!

342
00:35:51,278 --> 00:35:53,419
- Case dismissed.
- Yes!

343
00:35:53,454 --> 00:35:55,438
You're pretty good with
this lawyer and stuff.

344
00:35:55,473 --> 00:36:00,563
- Sorry I'm late your honour.
- Holy Porshe!

345
00:36:00,598 --> 00:36:02,148
She's gotta be from my attourney's office.

346
00:36:02,183 --> 00:36:05,714
Hey, thanks for coming but we're all set.
He's letting me go.

347
00:36:05,749 --> 00:36:08,925
- He's letting you go?
- Yeah, your job's pretty easy today.

348
00:36:08,960 --> 00:36:12,448
All you have to do now is stand
there and let me look at you.

349
00:36:12,483 --> 00:36:15,897
Listen, I'm gonna cut to
the chase. Me, you, dinner.

350
00:36:16,666 --> 00:36:18,958
What a... Please!

351
00:36:19,611 --> 00:36:21,146
I know, I get that reaction a lot.

352
00:36:21,181 --> 00:36:24,661
I create feelings in anothers that
they themselves don't understand.

353
00:36:25,498 --> 00:36:28,871
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I scare you?

354
00:36:28,906 --> 00:36:31,155
Well a little bit,
but I'll be all right.

355
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:36,810
- Okay... I'm gonna go talk to the judge.
- Do what you're gonna do baby.

356
00:36:36,845 --> 00:36:38,738
Oh but listen be careful,
falks around here

357
00:36:38,773 --> 00:36:41,258
are not firing on all cilinders
if you know what I mean.

358
00:36:44,741 --> 00:36:46,018
I'll keep that in mind.

359
00:36:47,060 --> 00:36:49,026
- Hey there Mater.
- Howdy Howdy.

360
00:36:49,061 --> 00:36:50,335
Hi falks.

361
00:36:52,639 --> 00:36:55,158
- You know her?
- She's a town attourney.

362
00:36:55,193 --> 00:36:57,634
- And my fiancee.
- What?

363
00:36:58,431 --> 00:37:01,697
I'm just kidding. She just
likes me for my body.

364
00:37:01,732 --> 00:37:03,731
Doc, you look great this morning.

365
00:37:03,766 --> 00:37:06,115
Did you do something different
with your side view mirrors?

366
00:37:06,150 --> 00:37:07,561
What do you want, Sally?

367
00:37:08,304 --> 00:37:10,988
Come on, make this guy fix the road.
The town needs this.

368
00:37:11,023 --> 00:37:16,302
No, I know his type. Race car.
The last thing this town needs.

369
00:37:16,940 --> 00:37:20,994
Okay, I didn't wanna to do this Doc,
but you leave me no choice.

370
00:37:21,455 --> 00:37:24,726
Fellow citizens, you're all aware
of our town's proud history.

371
00:37:24,761 --> 00:37:26,416
Here she goes again...

372
00:37:26,451 --> 00:37:31,687
Radiator Springs, the glorious jewel
strung on the necklace of root 66.

373
00:37:31,722 --> 00:37:32,765
The mother road.

374
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:38,081
It is our job and our pleasure to take care of
the travellers on our strench of that road.

375
00:37:38,116 --> 00:37:40,877
- Travellers! What travellers!
- Ignore him.

376
00:37:40,912 --> 00:37:44,401
But how I ask you are we
to care for those travellers,

377
00:37:44,436 --> 00:37:46,725
if there is no road for them to drive on?

378
00:37:46,760 --> 00:37:49,072
Luigi, what do you have in your store?

379
00:37:49,107 --> 00:37:49,996
Tires.

380
00:37:50,031 --> 00:37:54,318
- And if no one can get to you?
- I won't sell any... tires.

381
00:37:54,353 --> 00:37:55,673
I will lose everything!

382
00:37:55,708 --> 00:38:00,083
- Flo, what do you have in your store?
- I have gas. Lots of gas.

383
00:38:00,867 --> 00:38:01,891
Okay boys, stay with me.

384
00:38:01,926 --> 00:38:05,574
And Flo, what will happen if no one
can come to your station to buy gas?

385
00:38:05,609 --> 00:38:09,327
I'll go out of business and...
will have to leave town.

386
00:38:09,362 --> 00:38:12,536
And what's gonna happen to all of us
if Flo leaves town and closes her station?

387
00:38:14,652 --> 00:38:18,050
So don't you think that car
responsible should fix our road?

388
00:38:18,085 --> 00:38:21,456
The only guy strong enough
to fix that road is Big Al!

389
00:38:21,491 --> 00:38:25,937
- Lizzie, Big Al lived like 15 years ago.
- Then why don't you bring him up here?

390
00:38:25,972 --> 00:38:27,985
Oh he can do it,
he's got the horse power.

391
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:29,882
So what do you want him to do?

392
00:38:29,917 --> 00:38:30,859
- Fix the road!
- Fix the road!

393
00:38:31,074 --> 00:38:33,331
Because we are a town worth fixing!

394
00:38:33,366 --> 00:38:34,756
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

395
00:38:37,533 --> 00:38:39,020
Quiet in the court!

396
00:38:40,534 --> 00:38:43,126
Seems like my mind
has been changed for me.

397
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:46,374
- No!
- Nice ruling!

398
00:38:47,314 --> 00:38:50,551
Oh, I am so not taking you to dinner!

399
00:38:51,433 --> 00:38:54,627
That's okay, stickers.
You can take Bessie.

400
00:38:54,662 --> 00:38:56,880
Oh man, you get to work with Bessie!

401
00:38:56,915 --> 00:38:59,149
I give him a little too loading off.
So if I can.

402
00:38:59,184 --> 00:39:01,272
Bessie? Who's Bessie?

403
00:39:04,084 --> 00:39:08,369
This here is Bessie. Finest road
paving machine ever built.

404
00:39:08,404 --> 00:39:11,102
I'm here by sentencing you
to community service.

405
00:39:11,137 --> 00:39:14,415
You're gonna fix the road
under my supervision.

406
00:39:14,450 --> 00:39:16,395
What? This place is crazy!

407
00:39:16,430 --> 00:39:19,036
Hey, I notice that may be
a bad time right now, but...

408
00:39:19,071 --> 00:39:22,203
You owe me a 32 thousand
dollars in legal faith.

409
00:39:22,238 --> 00:39:22,819
What?

410
00:39:22,854 --> 00:39:26,522
So we're gonna hit you up to sweet Bessie
and you're gonna pull her nice.

411
00:39:26,557 --> 00:39:28,212
You gotta be kidding me!

412
00:39:28,247 --> 00:39:30,528
You start there where the road begins.

413
00:39:30,563 --> 00:39:34,078
You finish down there
where the road ends.

414
00:39:36,434 --> 00:39:38,191
Holy shoot!

415
00:39:39,247 --> 00:39:41,754
Wow, wow, wow,
how long is this gonna take?

416
00:39:41,789 --> 00:39:45,291
Well, solid has it right, it should
take him about five days.

417
00:39:45,326 --> 00:39:49,282
Five days? But I should be in California
shmoozing Dinoco right now!

418
00:39:49,317 --> 00:39:52,551
And if I were you, I'd quit
yapping and started working!

419
00:39:52,586 --> 00:39:54,809
- Hook him out, Mater.
- Okey dokey.

420
00:40:03,488 --> 00:40:04,656
Freedom!

421
00:40:10,886 --> 00:40:14,279
Maybe I should have
hook him up to Bessie.

422
00:40:14,314 --> 00:40:18,261
And then... enter to boot off.

423
00:40:20,830 --> 00:40:22,294
RADIATOR SPRINGS
LEAVING SO SOON?

424
00:40:22,329 --> 00:40:26,602
Good-bye, Radiator Springs!
And good-bye, Bessie!

425
00:40:26,637 --> 00:40:30,411
California, here I come! Yeah!

426
00:40:33,286 --> 00:40:36,494
I feel the wind! Yes!

427
00:40:38,696 --> 00:40:40,174
No. No, no, no.

428
00:40:41,953 --> 00:40:42,739
Not a gas!

429
00:40:42,774 --> 00:40:44,139
How could I be out of gas!

430
00:40:46,481 --> 00:40:49,457
Boy, we ain't as dumb
as you think we are.

431
00:40:49,492 --> 00:40:51,355
But how did you?

432
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:53,341
We safered your gas
while you're past out.

433
00:41:05,481 --> 00:41:07,401
- Gentlemen.
- Sheriff.

434
00:41:07,436 --> 00:41:08,611
Hey Sheriff.

435
00:41:08,646 --> 00:41:10,826
- Why are the tires so here?
- So the simplest queen.

436
00:41:10,861 --> 00:41:12,257
They were better what they were before.

437
00:41:12,539 --> 00:41:13,222
Guido!

438
00:41:14,404 --> 00:41:18,004
Give me more! I wanna get
look at that sexy Hotrod!

439
00:41:18,039 --> 00:41:21,023
Kiddo, how do you pretty good with!

440
00:41:21,058 --> 00:41:27,158
I can't do now of course sometimes
I'll be that fluid built up my engine blocking.

441
00:41:27,193 --> 00:41:30,182
Top shed don't flew
till he fixed my engine.

442
00:41:30,217 --> 00:41:32,372
That's why we made him do this.

443
00:41:32,407 --> 00:41:36,748
Boy you should have
heard me boom om my.

444
00:41:36,783 --> 00:41:38,622
Hotrod would have drive.

445
00:41:38,657 --> 00:41:41,604
Be funky photos see me get all mama.

446
00:41:42,536 --> 00:41:46,169
- Ah man, that's just great!
- Hey what's wrong?

447
00:41:46,204 --> 00:41:50,355
- My lucky stickers are all dirty.
- Nah, it ain't so, I'll clean it for you.

448
00:41:53,418 --> 00:41:56,843
No, no, no, no!
That won't be necessary.

449
00:41:58,322 --> 00:42:01,893
Hey! Hey big fellow!
Yeah, you in the red!

450
00:42:01,928 --> 00:42:04,650
I could use a little host down,
help me wash this all.

451
00:42:07,028 --> 00:42:09,944
- Where's he going?
- Oh, he's just a little bit shy.

452
00:42:09,979 --> 00:42:13,495
- He hates you for killing his flowers.
- I shouldn't have to put up with this!

453
00:42:13,530 --> 00:42:16,460
I'm a precision instrument
of speeding airodynamics.

454
00:42:16,495 --> 00:42:19,251
- You what?
- I'm a very famous race car!

455
00:42:19,286 --> 00:42:22,574
You are a famous race car?
A real race car?

456
00:42:22,609 --> 00:42:25,382
Yes I'm a real race car,
what do you think, look at me!

457
00:42:25,417 --> 00:42:29,402
I'm heard of racing my
entire life for my whole life!

458
00:42:29,437 --> 00:42:31,955
Then you know who I am!
I'm Lightning McQueen.

459
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:34,008
- Lightning McQueen!
- Yes, yes!

460
00:42:34,043 --> 00:42:39,711
I must excremetaly well, my exciment is
on the top of some place very high!

461
00:42:40,348 --> 00:42:42,051
Do you know many Ferraris?

462
00:42:42,086 --> 00:42:44,288
No, no, no. They race on Europian circuit.

463
00:42:44,323 --> 00:42:47,318
I'm in a Piston Cup!
What?

464
00:42:47,353 --> 00:42:49,366
Luigi, follow the Ferraris.

465
00:42:54,463 --> 00:42:56,748
Is that what I think it is?

466
00:42:58,515 --> 00:42:59,602
Customers.

467
00:43:00,237 --> 00:43:00,865
Customers!

468
00:43:01,358 --> 00:43:03,075
Customers, everyone!
Customers!

469
00:43:03,615 --> 00:43:04,688
Customers?

470
00:43:04,723 --> 00:43:06,281
Okay, I want everybody
calm down for a long time!

471
00:43:06,316 --> 00:43:07,803
Just remember what we rehearsed!

472
00:43:07,838 --> 00:43:10,183
Make sure you're open this.
Come in signs and out.

473
00:43:10,218 --> 00:43:11,611
And you all know what to do.

474
00:43:11,646 --> 00:43:13,431
All right, nobody panicks, here we go!

475
00:43:13,466 --> 00:43:16,857
Man, I just don't see
any honour anywhere.

476
00:43:16,892 --> 00:43:21,395
- Minny, I know exactly where we are.
- Yeah? We're in the middle of nowhere!

477
00:43:21,430 --> 00:43:22,410
Honey, please!

478
00:43:22,445 --> 00:43:23,547
Hello.

479
00:43:23,582 --> 00:43:26,425
Welcome to Radiator Springs
gateway ornament valley,

480
00:43:26,460 --> 00:43:29,225
legendary for its quality
service and friendly hospitality.

481
00:43:29,260 --> 00:43:30,210
How can we help you?

482
00:43:30,245 --> 00:43:32,097
We don't need anything,
thank you very much.

483
00:43:32,132 --> 00:43:34,334
Honey, ask her directions,
did the interstate.

484
00:43:34,369 --> 00:43:36,654
There's no need to
ask for directions, Minny.

485
00:43:36,689 --> 00:43:40,095
- I know exactly where we're going.
- I did the same thing on Orchard the Shakapi.

486
00:43:40,130 --> 00:43:42,716
You know we were handed
over there for the crazy days.

487
00:43:42,751 --> 00:43:45,383
Okay, okay, really.
We're just pity.

488
00:43:45,418 --> 00:43:50,640
What you really need is this sweet
taste of my hollay organic fuel.

489
00:43:50,675 --> 00:43:54,140
- Doesn't agree with my tank.
- We're just trying to find the interstate.

490
00:43:54,175 --> 00:43:55,361
Good to see you, soldier.

491
00:43:55,396 --> 00:43:58,803
Come on in my serfless after all
your government surfplace needs.

492
00:43:58,838 --> 00:44:00,140
Honey, surplass.

493
00:44:00,175 --> 00:44:03,522
- I think we have too much surpless.
- I do have a map over the Cosy Comer hotel.

494
00:44:03,557 --> 00:44:06,789
And if you do stay we'll offer a
free Lincoln continental breakfast.

495
00:44:06,824 --> 00:44:10,585
- Honey, she's got a map.
- I don't need a map, I have a GPS.

496
00:44:10,620 --> 00:44:12,550
Never need a map again, thank you.

497
00:44:12,585 --> 00:44:15,929
How about something to drink?
Spop it, Flows, BA Capey.

498
00:44:15,964 --> 00:44:19,479
- Finest fuel on the route 66.
- No, we just stopped off.

499
00:44:19,514 --> 00:44:23,490
And if you need tires you stop
by Luigi's Casa Della tires.

500
00:44:23,525 --> 00:44:27,438
- Bon of the leaning tower of tires.
- We're just trying to find the interstate.

501
00:44:27,473 --> 00:44:30,918
But you do need a paint man.
Ramone will paint you up right.

502
00:44:30,953 --> 00:44:34,386
Hey, anything you want.
You know like the flame job.

503
00:44:34,421 --> 00:44:36,082
- Uh, thanks, but...
- Cool flames.

504
00:44:36,117 --> 00:44:38,816
You like all scoop like this?
Bondage tail.

505
00:44:40,049 --> 00:44:43,751
- Honey, look. Londad.
- Okay now.

506
00:44:44,471 --> 00:44:46,066
We're gonna be going now, okay?

507
00:44:47,886 --> 00:44:50,399
A little something to remember us by!

508
00:44:51,549 --> 00:44:54,639
Come back soon, okay?
I mean you know where we are.

509
00:44:55,405 --> 00:44:56,663
Tell your friends.

510
00:44:56,698 --> 00:44:58,314
NICE BUTTE
RADIATOR SPRINGS

511
00:44:58,349 --> 00:45:02,584
- Okay, yes, you bet.
- Thanks again falks. Bye-bye now.

512
00:45:04,423 --> 00:45:06,913
Hey! Hey, hey, hey!
I know how to get to the interstate!

513
00:45:06,948 --> 00:45:09,039
- Oh, do you?
- Minny, no.

514
00:45:09,074 --> 00:45:12,155
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, not really.

515
00:45:12,190 --> 00:45:14,743
But listen, I'm Lightning McQueen,
the famous race car.

516
00:45:14,778 --> 00:45:16,163
I'm being held here against my will.

517
00:45:16,198 --> 00:45:18,478
I need you to call my team
so they can come rescue me.

518
00:45:18,513 --> 00:45:21,757
And get me to California to win
the Piston Cup. Do you understand?

519
00:45:24,957 --> 00:45:26,835
No, no, no!
No, no, this is true!

520
00:45:26,870 --> 00:45:28,279
I'm telling you!
You gotta help me!

521
00:45:28,314 --> 00:45:31,168
Don't leave me here!
I'm in Hill Billy hell!

522
00:45:31,203 --> 00:45:34,990
My IQ stopping by the second!
I'm becoming one of them!

523
00:45:37,292 --> 00:45:39,234
Okay, don't worry.
They know where we are now.

524
00:45:39,269 --> 00:45:44,184
They're gonna tell their friends.
You'll see. It's good.

525
00:45:46,515 --> 00:45:48,297
Still no sign of Lightning McQueen.

526
00:45:48,332 --> 00:45:51,103
Meanwhile Chick Hicks
arrived in California.

527
00:45:51,138 --> 00:45:54,491
And today he became the first car
to practice time on the track.

528
00:45:54,526 --> 00:45:57,490
Yeah well, it's just nice to get out here
before the other competitors.

529
00:45:57,525 --> 00:46:01,178
You know we're gonna hand
to harp fish. Kiss me an A.

530
00:46:10,824 --> 00:46:12,645
THE NEW FACE OF DINOCO

531
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,344
THE KING

532
00:46:13,379 --> 00:46:14,142
CHICK

533
00:46:14,434 --> 00:46:15,105
CHICK LIKES DINOCO

534
00:46:21,535 --> 00:46:22,401
CHICK THUNDER HICKS

535
00:46:23,767 --> 00:46:24,786
CHICK MAGNET

536
00:46:29,177 --> 00:46:31,373
Hey McQueen, beat you art out.

537
00:46:33,807 --> 00:46:34,880
Mater, let me get this straight.

538
00:46:34,915 --> 00:46:37,965
I can go when this road is done,
that's the deal, right?

539
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:43,623
- That's what they done deed saying.
- Okay, out of my way. I gotta road to finish.

540
00:46:55,497 --> 00:46:57,490
- He's done!
- Done?

541
00:46:58,110 --> 00:46:59,460
It's only been an hour.

542
00:47:03,087 --> 00:47:04,800
I'm done. Look, I'm finished.

543
00:47:04,835 --> 00:47:06,945
Just say thank you
and I'll be on my way.

544
00:47:06,980 --> 00:47:08,002
That's all you gotta say.

545
00:47:10,130 --> 00:47:12,234
I'm the first one on the new road!

546
00:47:16,026 --> 00:47:17,475
It might work move!

547
00:47:19,084 --> 00:47:20,370
It looks awful!

548
00:47:20,405 --> 00:47:22,132
Now it matches the rest of the town.

549
00:47:30,990 --> 00:47:32,244
Who do you think you are?

550
00:47:32,279 --> 00:47:34,791
Look, Doc said when
I'm finished, I could go.

551
00:47:34,826 --> 00:47:37,778
- That was a deal.
- A deal was you fix the road.

552
00:47:37,813 --> 00:47:39,044
Not make it worse.

553
00:47:39,079 --> 00:47:41,587
Now scraple on.
Start over again.

554
00:47:41,622 --> 00:47:45,302
Okay look grandpa, I'm not a bulldozer.
I'm a race car.

555
00:47:45,337 --> 00:47:50,457
Ho, is that right? Then why
don't we just have a little race?

556
00:47:50,492 --> 00:47:52,024
- Me and you.
- What?

557
00:47:53,257 --> 00:47:57,533
- Me and you? Is that a joke?
- If you win you go and I fix the road.

558
00:47:57,568 --> 00:48:01,623
- If I win, you do the road my way.
- Doc, what are you doing?

559
00:48:02,317 --> 00:48:04,262
I don't mean to be rude here, Doc.

560
00:48:04,297 --> 00:48:07,948
But your pride goes 0 to 60
in like what, 3.5 years?

561
00:48:07,983 --> 00:48:10,354
Then I reckon you ain't
got nothing to worry about.

562
00:48:10,389 --> 00:48:13,487
You wanna old timer?
That's a wonderful idea.

563
00:48:13,522 --> 00:48:14,963
Let's race!

564
00:48:17,311 --> 00:48:19,455
Gentlemen, this would be a one lap race.

565
00:48:19,490 --> 00:48:23,970
You will drive to Willie's bute or
around Willie's bute and come back.

566
00:48:24,005 --> 00:48:28,005
There will be no bumping, no cheeting,
no spitting, no biting.

567
00:48:28,040 --> 00:48:31,547
No road raging, no mayman,
no oil sucking, no pushing.

568
00:48:31,582 --> 00:48:36,803
No shouting, no backstabbing,
no road hogging and no lover gagging.

569
00:48:36,838 --> 00:48:38,288
Speed, I'm speed.

570
00:48:38,323 --> 00:48:40,799
Block paddle cadillac,
steam like a beemer.

571
00:48:42,519 --> 00:48:45,518
Let's many we don't here
to get a real race car.

572
00:48:45,553 --> 00:48:47,876
- That can't stop.
- Be stop.

573
00:48:49,404 --> 00:48:52,435
The race is only one lap, guys.

574
00:48:52,470 --> 00:48:55,184
Uno lappo! Don't need any help.

575
00:48:55,219 --> 00:48:58,767
- I work solomio.
- Fine, have it your way.

576
00:49:00,581 --> 00:49:03,755
- No pit stoppo. Comprendo?
- Okay!

577
00:49:04,924 --> 00:49:09,619
Gentlemen, start your engines!

578
00:49:19,365 --> 00:49:21,941
Great idea, Doc. Now the
road will never get done.

579
00:49:21,976 --> 00:49:25,976
- Luigi.
- On your mark.

580
00:49:26,011 --> 00:49:29,143
Get set. Uno parlemarli.
Duo for the show.

581
00:49:29,178 --> 00:49:32,439
Three to get ready.
And quatro to...

582
00:49:34,089 --> 00:49:35,015
Go!

583
00:49:43,511 --> 00:49:44,411
Ha?

584
00:49:45,579 --> 00:49:49,092
Doc, the flag means go.
Remember the flag?

585
00:49:49,127 --> 00:49:51,085
Even go. Go.

586
00:49:51,120 --> 00:49:53,867
Doc? What are you doing man?

587
00:49:53,902 --> 00:49:57,751
Oh dear, would see
my off to a poor start.

588
00:49:57,786 --> 00:49:59,677
Well, better late than never.

589
00:50:00,469 --> 00:50:03,706
- Come on Mater, I might need a little help.
- Ooh, okay.

590
00:50:05,625 --> 00:50:09,193
- You got your chow cable?
- I always got my toe cable. Why?

591
00:50:10,108 --> 00:50:11,330
Just in case.

592
00:50:24,243 --> 00:50:25,584
Oh, man!

593
00:50:33,148 --> 00:50:36,160
Hey! Was that flopping like a cadillac?

594
00:50:36,195 --> 00:50:40,241
Or was that stinging like a beemer?
I'm confused.

595
00:50:41,379 --> 00:50:44,554
You drive like you fix roads. Lousy.

596
00:50:45,333 --> 00:50:46,456
Have fun fishing Mater.

597
00:50:52,719 --> 00:50:55,959
I was starting to think
he knew he was gonna cry!

598
00:50:55,994 --> 00:50:58,803
Thank you, Mater. Thank you.

599
00:51:02,599 --> 00:51:04,779
I can make a little turn on dirt.
You think?

600
00:51:05,689 --> 00:51:08,540
No, and now I'm a Damie High.

601
00:51:08,575 --> 00:51:10,091
I'm never gonna get out of here!

602
00:51:11,084 --> 00:51:13,926
- You're needing a paint job man?
- No, thank you!

603
00:51:13,961 --> 00:51:17,383
- How about some organic fuel?
- Freak juice?

604
00:51:18,878 --> 00:51:22,891
Watching him work is making me thirsty.
Anybody wants to have a drink?

605
00:51:22,926 --> 00:51:27,021
No mate, I'm on one of my flavour special diets.

606
00:51:27,589 --> 00:51:31,711
I'm a pries A dramatic
this feed and airomaniac.

607
00:51:32,372 --> 00:51:36,621
You race like you fix roads.
I'll show him.

608
00:51:37,934 --> 00:51:39,171
I will show him!

609
00:51:41,338 --> 00:51:42,888
DOCTOR HUDSON
DR. OF INTERNAL COMBUSTION

610
00:51:48,942 --> 00:51:52,026
Oh, brake!
I hate it!

611
00:51:52,061 --> 00:51:55,739
- Hate! Hate! Hate!
- Music. Sweet music.

612
00:51:57,294 --> 00:52:02,352
- Maybe this wasn't such a good idea.
- Radiator Springs! I'd rather be eaten!

613
00:52:03,102 --> 00:52:04,980
Okay Bessie, you think that's funny?

614
00:52:05,385 --> 00:52:10,232
Great! I'm talking to Bessie now!
I'm talking to Bessie!

615
00:52:24,398 --> 00:52:25,487
Wow!

616
00:52:26,479 --> 00:52:27,586
Morning, Sally!

617
00:52:27,621 --> 00:52:33,193
Hey look at this, fancy new road that
Lightning McQueen done this night!

618
00:52:33,934 --> 00:52:35,227
Amazing!

619
00:52:39,473 --> 00:52:43,733
Ramone, mama ain't seen you
that low in years.

620
00:52:43,768 --> 00:52:48,756
- I haven't seen a road like this in years.
- Well then let's cruise baby!

621
00:52:48,791 --> 00:52:50,302
No, ain't slow.

622
00:52:50,337 --> 00:52:52,776
Bellissimo, oh so beautiful!

623
00:52:52,811 --> 00:52:56,812
Guido look, it's like
it was built by angels.

624
00:52:57,513 --> 00:53:01,750
I'll tell you what, I bet even
the road on the moon like this smooth.

625
00:53:01,785 --> 00:53:03,162
Doc, look at this.

626
00:53:03,818 --> 00:53:05,757
Should toast him
into a cac lot suiter.

627
00:53:06,475 --> 00:53:09,549
Well he ain't finished yet.
Still got a long way to go.

628
00:53:10,210 --> 00:53:12,194
Dunito, rucca Luigi!

629
00:53:13,399 --> 00:53:15,031
This is fantastico!

630
00:53:15,634 --> 00:53:18,801
That looks like fun.
Mater I got paves, next turn!

631
00:53:19,391 --> 00:53:23,006
Hey Luigi, this new road make
your place look like a dump!

632
00:53:23,041 --> 00:53:26,000
Oh! That crazy old devil woman!

633
00:53:30,642 --> 00:53:33,872
She's right! Guido!

634
00:53:35,334 --> 00:53:37,563
That punk actually did a good job.

635
00:53:39,557 --> 00:53:42,911
Well now, where the hack is he?

636
00:53:49,482 --> 00:53:51,966
Sheriff? Is he making another run for it?

637
00:53:52,001 --> 00:53:55,322
No, no. He ran out an assfull
in the middle of the night.

638
00:53:55,357 --> 00:53:57,341
Asked me if he can get down here.

639
00:53:57,376 --> 00:54:00,314
All he's trying to do
is make that carve turn.

640
00:54:00,349 --> 00:54:00,965
No, no, no!

641
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:06,393
Ah, great! I've turned on every
track on every race track.

642
00:54:08,312 --> 00:54:12,145
Sheriff, why don't you go get
yourself a quarter of oil that flows.

643
00:54:12,180 --> 00:54:15,263
- I'll keep an eye on him.
- Well thanks, Doc!

644
00:54:15,298 --> 00:54:17,605
I've been feeling about a quart of load.

645
00:54:32,324 --> 00:54:36,039
- This ain't ass fold son, this is dirt.
- Oh great, what do you want?

646
00:54:36,074 --> 00:54:37,285
You're here to globe?

647
00:54:37,320 --> 00:54:40,868
You don't have three wheel brakes,
so you gotta pitch it hard.

648
00:54:40,903 --> 00:54:44,110
Brake it loose and just
drive it with a throttle.

649
00:54:44,145 --> 00:54:47,130
Give it too much and you'll be
out of the dirt within the tulip.

650
00:54:47,807 --> 00:54:50,524
So you're judge, the doctor
and the racing expert.

651
00:54:51,091 --> 00:54:56,716
I'll put it simple, if you're going hard enough left,
you'll find yourself turning right.

652
00:55:00,571 --> 00:55:06,981
Oh, right. That makes perfect sense.
Turn right to go left! Yes! Thank you!

653
00:55:07,016 --> 00:55:08,634
Or should I say:
No, thank you!

654
00:55:08,669 --> 00:55:12,182
Because in opposite world maybe
that really means thank you!

655
00:55:15,206 --> 00:55:18,626
Crazy grandpa car.
What an idiot!

656
00:55:26,309 --> 00:55:28,173
Turn right to go left.

657
00:55:47,399 --> 00:55:50,631
Turn right to go left!
Guess what? I tried it!

658
00:55:50,666 --> 00:55:51,055
And you know what?

659
00:55:51,090 --> 00:55:53,379
This crazy thing happened!
I went right!

660
00:55:53,414 --> 00:55:57,120
You keep talking to yourself,
people will think you're crazy.

661
00:55:57,155 --> 00:55:59,140
- Thanks for the tip!
- What?

662
00:55:59,175 --> 00:56:00,783
I wasn't talking to you!

663
00:56:07,978 --> 00:56:10,678
Oh Guido, bellissimo!

664
00:56:11,685 --> 00:56:12,759
It looks great!

665
00:56:14,139 --> 00:56:15,014
This is great!

666
00:56:18,588 --> 00:56:19,370
Uh, Lord.

667
00:56:21,211 --> 00:56:24,330
Mater, I need you to watch
the prisoner tonight.

668
00:56:24,365 --> 00:56:27,999
It'll be done! Wait a minute,
what if he tries to run again?

669
00:56:28,034 --> 00:56:30,498
Just let him run out of
gas and tour him back.

670
00:56:30,533 --> 00:56:33,035
- But keep an eye on him.
- Yes sir!

671
00:56:36,159 --> 00:56:38,757
I'm stuck here paving
the stinking road!

672
00:56:38,792 --> 00:56:42,434
Chick's in California shmoozing Dinoco.
My Dinoco!

673
00:56:42,469 --> 00:56:44,391
Wow, who's touching me!

674
00:56:44,426 --> 00:56:47,033
You have a slow leak.
Guido, he'll fix.

675
00:56:47,068 --> 00:56:49,148
You're making such a nice road.

676
00:56:49,183 --> 00:56:52,082
You come to my shop and Luigi
take a good care of you.

677
00:56:52,117 --> 00:56:53,285
Even though you're not a Ferrari.

678
00:56:53,320 --> 00:56:58,954
You buy four tires, I give you and
full sizes there episodal liquid.

679
00:56:58,989 --> 00:57:01,596
Look, I get all my tires for free.

680
00:57:03,173 --> 00:57:06,497
Look at his style!
He's driving a hard bargain.

681
00:57:07,070 --> 00:57:11,733
Luigi make you anovile, you
buy one tire, I give you three.

682
00:57:12,339 --> 00:57:13,507
Would you look at that!

683
00:57:14,410 --> 00:57:16,442
Ramone, Ramone.

684
00:57:23,635 --> 00:57:30,179
This is it, my last orc. You buy one tire,
I give you seven tires for free!

685
00:57:30,214 --> 00:57:32,179
Done. If you're interested,
you go to my place.

686
00:57:39,250 --> 00:57:42,852
Oh Red, you missed the spot.
Right there. In the hood.

687
00:57:47,450 --> 00:57:48,588
Help! Please!

688
00:57:48,623 --> 00:57:49,511
Stop!

689
00:57:51,891 --> 00:57:52,800
Thanks Red.

690
00:57:54,700 --> 00:57:57,790
- What was that for?
- Do you wanna stay at the Cosy Cone or what?

691
00:57:57,825 --> 00:58:02,289
If you do, you gotta be clean, cause even
here in Hillbilly Hall we have standards.

692
00:58:03,201 --> 00:58:04,081
- I don't get it.
- Nothing.

693
00:58:04,116 --> 00:58:06,542
I just thought I'd say thank you
for doing a great job.

694
00:58:06,577 --> 00:58:08,591
That's what I thought,
I'd like you to stay with me.

695
00:58:08,626 --> 00:58:10,619
Or not with me! But there.

696
00:58:10,654 --> 00:58:14,874
Not with me there, but there
in your own Cozy Cone.

697
00:58:14,909 --> 00:58:16,141
And I'll be in my Cone, and...

698
00:58:16,176 --> 00:58:18,765
Wait, you're being nice to me.

699
00:58:18,800 --> 00:58:20,916
I mean if you wanna stay at
the beauty impale, that's fine.

700
00:58:20,951 --> 00:58:25,607
- You know I understand your criminal types.
- No, no, it's okay. The Cozy Cone.

701
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:27,657
It's newly referbished.

702
00:58:29,151 --> 00:58:32,581
Yeah, it's like a clever little twist
on motels made out of cation,

703
00:58:32,616 --> 00:58:35,657
which of course cars
usually try to avoid,

704
00:58:35,692 --> 00:58:39,028
but now we're gonna
stay in them. That's fun.

705
00:58:40,457 --> 00:58:42,290
Take all that on your own, did you?

706
00:58:43,981 --> 00:58:45,034
Cone number one if you want.

707
00:58:51,052 --> 00:58:54,557
Hey, do I spot little pin
stripe tattoo back there?

708
00:58:55,959 --> 00:58:56,802
That's just...

709
00:58:59,472 --> 00:59:01,401
Ah, you saw that?

710
00:59:02,184 --> 00:59:05,885
Just gonna be going... Yeah.

711
00:59:11,221 --> 00:59:13,576
You know whose girl is doloraine?

712
00:59:13,611 --> 00:59:17,098
Good looking girl.
Just like a Jaguar.

713
00:59:17,133 --> 00:59:18,367
Only she was a truck.

714
00:59:18,402 --> 00:59:22,033
You know, I used to cry hand to her,
just so I could speak to it.

715
00:59:23,071 --> 00:59:25,705
- What are you talking about?
- I don't know.

716
00:59:25,740 --> 00:59:29,955
Hey, I know something we can do tonight,
cause I'm in charge of watching you.

717
00:59:29,990 --> 00:59:34,073
No Mater, I gotta finish this road
and I have to get out of here.

718
00:59:34,108 --> 00:59:37,835
Well that's all right,
Mr. I-Can't-Turn-On-Dirt.

719
00:59:37,870 --> 00:59:42,500
- You probably couldn't handle it anyway.
- Wow, easy now Mater.

720
00:59:42,535 --> 00:59:44,807
You know who you're talking to,
this is Lightning McQueen.

721
00:59:44,842 --> 00:59:46,778
I can handle anything.

722
00:59:47,822 --> 00:59:51,225
- Mater, I'm not doing this!
- Oh come on, you'll love it!

723
00:59:52,999 --> 00:59:56,843
- Tractor tip is fun!
- This is ridiculous.

724
00:59:57,948 --> 01:00:00,516
All right, listen.
When I say go, we go.

725
01:00:00,551 --> 01:00:02,554
But don't let Frank catch you. Go!

726
01:00:03,909 --> 01:00:04,647
Who's Frank?

727
01:00:07,211 --> 01:00:08,335
Wait, Mater!

728
01:00:11,419 --> 01:00:14,172
This is what you do,
you just sneak up in front of him.

729
01:00:14,207 --> 01:00:17,917
And then hunk, they'll do
the rest. Watch this.

730
01:00:39,410 --> 01:00:42,479
I just wanted,
turtle is so doomed.

731
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:46,433
Okay, you are back, you don't
get much better than this.

732
01:00:46,468 --> 01:00:48,495
Yep, you're living in a dream, Mater boy.

733
01:01:02,357 --> 01:01:04,551
I don't care who you are,
that's funny!

734
01:01:05,451 --> 01:01:07,844
- Your turn, bud.
- Mater, I can't.

735
01:01:07,879 --> 01:01:09,412
I don't even got a horn.

736
01:01:09,447 --> 01:01:11,656
- Baby.
- I'm not a baby.

737
01:01:13,213 --> 01:01:16,040
Stop, stop, okay?
I'll do something.

738
01:02:06,938 --> 01:02:07,901
That's Frank.

739
01:02:30,676 --> 01:02:32,370
Hey, look out!

740
01:02:39,849 --> 01:02:41,499
He's gonna get you!

741
01:03:00,093 --> 01:03:01,687
Oh, customers!

742
01:03:06,274 --> 01:03:07,529
Ah, no, no, no.

743
01:03:11,380 --> 01:03:14,056
Tomorrow night we can
go look for the ghost line.

744
01:03:14,091 --> 01:03:16,894
- I can't wait, Mater.
- Oh, yeah!

745
01:03:18,238 --> 01:03:22,250
Oh boy, you gotta admit,
that was fu-un!

746
01:03:22,285 --> 01:03:24,123
Oh yeah, yeah.

747
01:03:24,158 --> 01:03:27,085
Well, we better get you
back to the impound law.

748
01:03:27,120 --> 01:03:30,229
You know I actually Sally's
gonna let me stay at the motel.

749
01:03:31,740 --> 01:03:36,802
- Getting cosy at the cone, is we?
- No, come on, are you kidding?

750
01:03:36,837 --> 01:03:41,319
Besides she can't stand me.
I don't like her, to be honest.

751
01:03:41,354 --> 01:03:42,677
Yeah, you're probably right.

752
01:03:43,896 --> 01:03:46,454
- Hey look, there's Sally!
- Where, where?

753
01:03:47,954 --> 01:03:50,677
You're in love with miss Sally.

754
01:03:50,712 --> 01:03:52,299
- No, I'm not.
- Yes, you do, do.

755
01:03:52,334 --> 01:03:53,694
- No way.
- Way.

756
01:03:54,469 --> 01:03:58,442
- You're in love with miss Sally!
- That's a real mature, real grown-up.

757
01:03:58,477 --> 01:04:01,498
You love her, you love her,
you love her, you love her.

758
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:05,280
Mater, enough.
Will you stop that?

759
01:04:05,315 --> 01:04:07,745
- What?
- That driving backwards stuff.

760
01:04:07,780 --> 01:04:09,501
It's creeping me out.
You're gonna rack or something.

761
01:04:09,536 --> 01:04:11,813
Rack? Shoot.

762
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:16,284
I'm the world best backwards driver.
Is what he's right here, lover boy.

763
01:04:18,248 --> 01:04:19,488
What are you doing?
Watch out!

764
01:04:20,414 --> 01:04:21,876
Mater? Mater?

765
01:04:36,130 --> 01:04:38,270
Hey, take it easy, Mater!

766
01:04:49,635 --> 01:04:50,811
He's nuts!

767
01:04:52,929 --> 01:04:54,379
Ain't no need to watch where I'm going!

768
01:04:57,297 --> 01:05:02,008
- Just need to know where I've been.
- That was incredible! How did you do that?

769
01:05:02,043 --> 01:05:06,127
Rear view mirrors. We'll get you
something in Al Deit if you want.

770
01:05:06,963 --> 01:05:09,145
Yeah, maybe I'll use
them in my big race.

771
01:05:09,180 --> 01:05:12,893
What's so important about
this race of yours anyway?

772
01:05:14,518 --> 01:05:18,199
It's not just a race. We're talking
about the Piston Cup.

773
01:05:18,234 --> 01:05:20,519
I've been dreaming
about it my whole life!

774
01:05:20,554 --> 01:05:23,886
I'll be the first rookie
in history ever to win it.

775
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:28,868
And when I do, we're talking big news
sponsor with private helicopters.

776
01:05:28,903 --> 01:05:32,607
No more medicated bumper ointment,
no more rusty old cars.

777
01:05:32,642 --> 01:05:34,387
What's wrong with rusty old cars?

778
01:05:37,008 --> 01:05:39,487
I don't mean you, Mater.
I mean other old cars.

779
01:05:39,522 --> 01:05:43,302
- You know not like you, I like you.
- It's okay body.

780
01:05:43,337 --> 01:05:48,300
Are you doing maybe one day I can get
a ride in one of them helicopters?

781
01:05:48,335 --> 01:05:53,209
I mean I've always wanted to ride
in one of them fancy helicopters.

782
01:05:53,244 --> 01:05:55,315
- Yeah, yeah, sure, sure.
- You mean it?

783
01:05:56,099 --> 01:05:59,205
- Oh yeah, anything you say.
- I knew it.

784
01:05:59,240 --> 01:06:03,400
- I know I made a good choice!
- In what?

785
01:06:04,067 --> 01:06:06,302
My best friend.

786
01:06:13,283 --> 01:06:14,499
See you tomorrow body!

787
01:06:14,534 --> 01:06:17,893
Queen aunt Sally,
parking made a treat!

788
01:06:31,511 --> 01:06:32,793
Number one, number one.

789
01:06:32,828 --> 01:06:34,567
Ah, number one!

790
01:06:36,096 --> 01:06:38,383
- This is nice!
- Hey stickers.

791
01:06:39,787 --> 01:06:41,820
- I'm sorry.
- You scared me!

792
01:06:41,855 --> 01:06:42,886
You gotta be careful.

793
01:06:42,921 --> 01:06:46,360
- I scared myself scaring you scaring me.
- I mean that wasn't like scare scares.

794
01:06:46,395 --> 01:06:47,676
- No, of course not.
- There was more...

795
01:06:47,711 --> 01:06:53,443
- Just I overheard you talking to Mater.
- When? Just now? What did you hear?

796
01:06:53,478 --> 01:06:55,124
Oh, just something
about a helicopter ride.

797
01:06:55,920 --> 01:06:58,529
Oh yeah, he got a kick out
of that, didn't he?

798
01:06:58,564 --> 01:07:00,643
- Did you mean it?
- What?

799
01:07:00,678 --> 01:07:03,098
- That you'll get him a ride?
- Oh, who knows?

800
01:07:03,133 --> 01:07:05,828
I mean first thing's first, I gotta get out
of here and make the race.

801
01:07:08,185 --> 01:07:14,502
- You know, Mater trusts you.
- Yeah. Okay.

802
01:07:15,222 --> 01:07:17,318
- Did you mean that?
- What?

803
01:07:17,353 --> 01:07:23,209
Was it just a 'Yeah, okay' or
'Yeah, okay' or 'Yeah, okay'?

804
01:07:23,244 --> 01:07:25,880
Look, I'm exhausted,
it's kinda been a long day.

805
01:07:26,738 --> 01:07:29,632
Yeah, okay.
Good night.

806
01:07:33,339 --> 01:07:35,253
Hey, thank you.

807
01:07:38,247 --> 01:07:41,994
- What did you just say?
- Thanks for letting me stay here.

808
01:07:42,788 --> 01:07:46,206
It's nice to be out of the impound,
and this is, it's great.

809
01:07:46,241 --> 01:07:49,760
- Newly furbished, right?
- Yeah.

810
01:07:50,694 --> 01:07:53,035
- Good night.
- Good night.

811
01:08:15,150 --> 01:08:17,648
Where you town this
disrespectful joke off!

812
01:08:17,683 --> 01:08:21,407
Respect the classics, man.
It's Hendrix!

813
01:08:47,183 --> 01:08:48,455
No!

814
01:08:51,386 --> 01:08:52,558
I gotta get out of here!

815
01:08:53,328 --> 01:08:54,829
Hey, have you seen the Sheriff?

816
01:08:56,259 --> 01:08:59,465
- Hey, what are you doing?
- You need a good pit, city boy?

817
01:08:59,500 --> 01:09:03,144
I just need my daily gas
rush from the Sheriff.

818
01:09:03,179 --> 01:09:05,326
Wait forward flows,
now get out of here!

819
01:09:05,361 --> 01:09:08,095
I've been trying to get out
of here for three days!

820
01:09:08,130 --> 01:09:09,917
I hope you enjoy the show!

821
01:09:23,755 --> 01:09:28,926
Ho, Doc. Time to clean out
the garage, body.

822
01:09:42,813 --> 01:09:45,680

01:10:19,503 --> 01:10:21,114
You have three Piston Cups,
how could you...

831
01:10:21,149 --> 01:10:24,387
I knew you couldn't drive,
I didn't know you couldn't read.

832
01:10:24,422 --> 01:10:25,832
You're the Hudson Hornet!

833
01:10:25,867 --> 01:10:27,799
Wait over at flows, like I told you!

834
01:10:27,834 --> 01:10:30,123
Of course, I can't believe
I didn't see you before!

835
01:10:30,158 --> 01:10:32,024
You're the fabulous Hudson Hornet!

836
01:10:32,059 --> 01:10:34,329
You still hold the records
for most wins in a single season.

837
01:10:34,364 --> 01:10:36,937
Ah, we gotta talk. You gotta
show me your tricks, please!

838
01:10:36,972 --> 01:10:38,205
I already tried that!

839
01:10:38,240 --> 01:10:41,185
You won the championship three times!
Look at those tropheys!

840
01:10:41,220 --> 01:10:44,774
You look! All I see is
a bunch of empty cups.

841
01:10:50,093 --> 01:10:54,932
You know, sumota motor yogurts
can really lower your heart peedun.

842
01:10:54,967 --> 01:10:56,986
Oh, take your carwash, hippy.

843
01:10:57,021 --> 01:11:00,538
Hey! Look at my husband yo!
There's your come.

844
01:11:00,573 --> 01:11:04,140
- You know baby.
- You're smoking hot!

845
01:11:04,175 --> 01:11:05,268
There he is.

846
01:11:06,657 --> 01:11:08,596
Did you know Doc was
a famous race car?

847
01:11:12,022 --> 01:11:15,998
- Doc? Our Doc?
- No, no, no, it's true!

848
01:11:16,033 --> 01:11:19,145
He's a real racing legend!
He's a fabulous Hudson Hornet!

849
01:11:19,180 --> 01:11:22,786
Fabulous? I never seen Doc drive
more than 20 miles per hour!

850
01:11:22,821 --> 01:11:26,498
- I mean have you ever seen him race?
- No, but I wish I could have.

851
01:11:26,533 --> 01:11:30,516
They say he was amazing!
He won three Piston Cups!

852
01:11:30,551 --> 01:11:32,485
He did what in his cup?

853
01:11:32,520 --> 01:11:34,948
I think he'd started
to get to the boy!

854
01:11:34,983 --> 01:11:37,918
I'll say, look how red he is!

855
01:11:37,953 --> 01:11:39,926
I think he needs a
little cortle parley man!

856
01:11:39,961 --> 01:11:42,477
- Are you sick mate?
- You're all looking a little picket.

857
01:11:42,512 --> 01:11:44,216
He ain't needs no
quarter parley for sure!

858
01:11:45,878 --> 01:11:47,758
Hey, what are you doing?

859
01:11:47,793 --> 01:11:49,873
It's okay Sheriff, you can trust me, right?

860
01:11:49,908 --> 01:11:52,680
I trust you all right,
it's him I'm worried about.

861
01:11:54,931 --> 01:11:56,068
I trust him.

862
01:11:57,390 --> 01:11:58,265
Come on, let's take a drive.

863
01:11:58,300 --> 01:12:00,358
- A drive?
- Yeah, a drive.

864
01:12:00,393 --> 01:12:03,795
Aren't you big city race cars
ever just take a drive?

865
01:12:04,631 --> 01:12:06,395
No, we don't.

866
01:12:28,770 --> 01:12:32,631
Hey Stickers!
You're coming or what?

867
01:12:40,094 --> 01:12:43,324
- And you thought he was gonna run.
- Can you believe it man?

868
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:46,005
He actually thought Doc
was a famous race car!

869
01:12:47,024 --> 01:12:48,801
Smoke too much.

870
01:12:51,212 --> 01:12:53,500
Okay you got me out here,
where we're going?

871
01:12:53,535 --> 01:12:55,033
I don't know.

872
01:13:00,688 --> 01:13:02,137
Oh, yes.

873
01:14:51,016 --> 01:14:54,687
Wow! What is this place?

874
01:14:55,509 --> 01:14:59,874
Well well, used to be the most
popular stop on the mother road.

875
01:15:04,559 --> 01:15:05,910
This place?

876
01:15:09,970 --> 01:15:11,522
Yeah, imagine.

877
01:15:13,736 --> 01:15:15,766
I imagine what it must
have been like to stay here.

878
01:15:18,737 --> 01:15:23,110
You know I don't get you. How does
a Porshe wind up in a place like this?

879
01:15:23,959 --> 01:15:27,975
Well, it's really pretty simple,
I was an attourney in LA.

880
01:15:28,635 --> 01:15:32,689
- Living life in a fast lane.
- Oh you were, weren't you?

881
01:15:32,724 --> 01:15:35,024
- Were you rich?
- What?

882
01:15:35,059 --> 01:15:39,630
- Just clues to the puzzle.
- Yeah, okay.

883
01:15:39,665 --> 01:15:41,587
Well, that was my life
and you know what?

884
01:15:42,283 --> 01:15:46,320
It never felt... happy.

885
01:15:47,950 --> 01:15:52,657
- Yeah... I mean really?
- Yeah, so I left California.

886
01:15:52,692 --> 01:15:56,000
Just drove and drove and
finally broke down right here.

887
01:15:56,717 --> 01:15:59,147
Doc picks me up,
Flo took me in.

888
01:15:59,761 --> 01:16:02,327
They all did. I never left.

889
01:16:04,012 --> 01:16:07,255
No, I understand you
mean a little R&R.

890
01:16:07,290 --> 01:16:12,367
Recharge your old batteries, but after
a while why didn't you go back?

891
01:16:14,377 --> 01:16:15,871
I fell in love.

892
01:16:16,535 --> 01:16:19,647
- Oh.
- Yep.

893
01:16:21,113 --> 01:16:24,184
- Corvette?
- No.

894
01:16:29,247 --> 01:16:32,140
I fell in love with this.

895
01:16:46,739 --> 01:16:48,210
Look at that!

896
01:16:51,052 --> 01:16:53,778
Look at them driving right by, they don't
even know what they're missing!

897
01:16:54,869 --> 01:16:56,486
Well it didn't used to be that way.

898
01:16:58,384 --> 01:17:00,433
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah.

899
01:17:01,178 --> 01:17:03,725
Fourty years ago that interstate
down there didn't exist.

900
01:17:04,747 --> 01:17:07,077
- Really?
- Yeah.

901
01:17:08,032 --> 01:17:11,222
Back then cars came across
the country a whole different way.

902
01:17:12,452 --> 01:17:13,670
How do you mean?

903
01:17:13,705 --> 01:17:16,916
Well the road didn't cut through
the land like that interstate.

904
01:17:17,669 --> 01:17:22,037
It moved with the land and now
it rolls that fellow occurred.

905
01:17:23,251 --> 01:17:25,044
- Good morning.
- Nice day, ha?

906
01:17:27,018 --> 01:17:30,263
Cars didn't drive on it to make great time.

907
01:17:30,936 --> 01:17:33,148
They drove on it to have a great time.

908
01:17:35,006 --> 01:17:40,706
Long ago, but not so very long ago.

909
01:17:43,834 --> 01:17:49,293
The world was different, oh yes it was.

910
01:17:52,164 --> 01:17:57,801
You settle down in your
built town and made it there.

911
01:17:58,888 --> 01:18:05,536
And you watched the grow,
it was your town.

912
01:18:07,277 --> 01:18:08,528
What happened?

913
01:18:09,426 --> 01:18:12,391
The town got by-passed just to save
ten minutes of driving.

914
01:18:13,644 --> 01:18:19,176
Time goes by and time brings changes.
You changed too.

915
01:18:22,005 --> 01:18:28,009
Nothing cause that you
can't handle so on you go.

916
01:18:30,514 --> 01:18:38,369
You never see it coming, when
the world cames in on you.

917
01:18:38,931 --> 01:18:46,281
On your town nothing you can't do.

918
01:18:48,214 --> 01:18:53,703
Main street isn't main street anymore.

919
01:18:56,404 --> 01:19:02,251
No one seems in needers
like they did before.

920
01:19:05,165 --> 01:19:10,916
It's hard to find a reason left to stay.

921
01:19:13,066 --> 01:19:16,256
But it's our town.

922
01:19:18,293 --> 01:19:20,910
You love it anyway.

923
01:19:22,287 --> 01:19:29,555
Come what may, it's our town.

924
01:19:39,537 --> 01:19:42,274
How great would it be to
see this place in its hayday.

925
01:19:42,309 --> 01:19:44,834
Can't tell you how many times
I have dreamed of that.

926
01:19:45,567 --> 01:19:48,651
That one of these days we'll find
a way to get it back on the map.

927
01:19:49,366 --> 01:19:52,810
Yeah... Hey listen,
thanks for the drive.

928
01:19:52,845 --> 01:19:57,079
I had a great time. It's kinda nice
to slow down every once in a while.

929
01:19:57,718 --> 01:19:58,893
You're welcome.

930
01:20:08,048 --> 01:20:11,790
Hey listen, listen if anybody asks you,
we was out some ice mail boxes, okay?

931
01:20:12,534 --> 01:20:13,516
What?

932
01:20:29,834 --> 01:20:31,423
Oh man, the paint's still wet!

933
01:20:41,778 --> 01:20:43,667
No, no, no, get out of a store.

934
01:20:43,702 --> 01:20:47,377
Hey! Don't be deradium!
Here, take this snow tires.

935
01:20:49,896 --> 01:20:52,977
Then where did all these call
dirts transports come from?

936
01:20:53,868 --> 01:20:57,687
Hey, hey guys.
There's one going this way.

937
01:20:58,363 --> 01:20:59,248
I got it.

938
01:21:04,312 --> 01:21:06,397
Come here, little tractor.
Come here.

939
01:21:07,100 --> 01:21:09,846
Yeah, it's a good tractor.
No, no, come here.

940
01:21:10,496 --> 01:21:16,266
What are you doing? You're not supposed
to go wondering all for... alone.

941
01:21:28,214 --> 01:21:31,060
What are you doing with
all those racing tires?

942
01:21:38,321 --> 01:21:40,625
Come on, Doc. Drive!

943
01:23:00,689 --> 01:23:03,542
Wow! You're amazing!

944
01:23:06,751 --> 01:23:08,888
What are you doing?
Doc! Wait!

945
01:23:14,624 --> 01:23:15,930
Come on, tractor!

946
01:23:19,174 --> 01:23:22,025
Doc, hold it seriously!
Your driving's incredible!

947
01:23:22,060 --> 01:23:25,796
- Wonderful. But go away.
- But I mean you still got it!

948
01:23:25,831 --> 01:23:29,158
- I'm asking you to leave!
- Come on, I'm a race car, you're...

949
01:23:29,193 --> 01:23:32,323
a much older race car but under
the hood you and I are the same!

950
01:23:32,358 --> 01:23:35,699
We are not the same!
Understand, now get out!

951
01:23:35,734 --> 01:23:38,473
How could a car like you quit
at the top of your game?

952
01:23:40,647 --> 01:23:42,666
You think I quit?

953
01:23:51,193 --> 01:23:55,543
CRASH!
HUDSON HORNET
OUT FOR SEASON

954
01:23:55,668 --> 01:24:00,681
Right... You're big reckon 54.

955
01:24:00,716 --> 01:24:03,209
They quit on me.

956
01:24:04,089 --> 01:24:07,457
When I finally got put together,
I went back expecting a big welcome.

957
01:24:07,492 --> 01:24:08,950
You know what they said?

958
01:24:08,985 --> 01:24:13,333
You're history. Move right on to
the next rookie standing in line.

959
01:24:16,226 --> 01:24:21,247
That was a lot left in me.
I never got a chance to show them.

960
01:24:23,519 --> 01:24:27,646
I keep that to remind me
never to go back.

961
01:24:28,577 --> 01:24:33,604
I just never expected that
that world would... find me here.

962
01:24:34,945 --> 01:24:37,424
Hey look Doc, I'm not them!

963
01:24:37,459 --> 01:24:38,900
- Oh yeah?
- No, I'm not!

964
01:24:38,935 --> 01:24:42,756
When was the last time you cared about
something except for yourself, hotrod?

965
01:24:42,791 --> 01:24:47,160
You name me one time
and I will take it all back.

966
01:24:50,075 --> 01:24:51,886
I didn't think so.

967
01:24:52,894 --> 01:24:56,733
These are good falk around here.
Who care about one another.

968
01:24:56,768 --> 01:25:00,288
I don't want them depending
on someone they can't count on.

969
01:25:01,229 --> 01:25:05,185
Oh like you? You've been here how long and
your friends don't even know who you are.

970
01:25:05,897 --> 01:25:10,305
- Who's caring about only himself?
- Just finish that road and get out of here!

971
01:25:25,175 --> 01:25:30,123
- Will you turn that disrespectful took off!
- Respect the classics man!

972
01:25:56,957 --> 01:26:01,304
He's done. He must have finished it
while we was all sleeping.

973
01:26:01,339 --> 01:26:03,001
Good riddens.

974
01:26:11,307 --> 01:26:12,733
He's gone?

975
01:26:12,768 --> 01:26:15,430
Well, we wouldn't want him
to miss that race of his.

976
01:26:21,151 --> 01:26:26,073
- Oh dude, are you crying?
- No, I'm happy!

977
01:26:26,108 --> 01:26:28,661
I don't have to watch him
every second of the day anymore!

978
01:26:28,696 --> 01:26:30,167
I'm glad he's gone!

979
01:26:36,998 --> 01:26:41,960
- What's wrong with Red?
- Oh, he's just sad cause you left to town

980
01:26:41,995 --> 01:26:44,946
and went to your big race
to win the Piston Cup

981
01:26:44,981 --> 01:26:47,797
that you've always dreamed
about your whole life

982
01:26:47,832 --> 01:26:53,400
and get that big old sponsor and that
fancy helicopter you was talking about.

983
01:26:58,876 --> 01:27:00,199
Wait a minute!

984
01:27:01,878 --> 01:27:04,588
I know you wouldn't leave
without saying you left!

985
01:27:04,623 --> 01:27:07,650
What are you doing here son,
you're gonna miss your race!

986
01:27:07,685 --> 01:27:10,832
Don't worry, I'll give you the police
escort and we'll make out on time.

987
01:27:10,867 --> 01:27:14,433
Thank you Sheriff.
But you know I can't go just yet.

988
01:27:14,468 --> 01:27:15,811
Why not?

989
01:27:15,846 --> 01:27:21,052
I'm not sure these tires can
get me all the way to California.

990
01:27:21,087 --> 01:27:21,853
Pit stop?

991
01:27:21,888 --> 01:27:24,301
Yeah, does anybody might
know what time Luigi's opens?

992
01:27:25,460 --> 01:27:28,582
I can't believe it!
Four new tires!

993
01:27:28,617 --> 01:27:33,041
- Gracia, Mr. Lightning, gracia!
- Would you look at that!

994
01:27:33,076 --> 01:27:35,654
Out first real customer in years!

995
01:27:35,689 --> 01:27:39,230
I am filled with tears of extasy!

996
01:27:39,265 --> 01:27:43,019
For this is the most
glorious day of my life!

997
01:27:43,054 --> 01:27:47,003
All right, Luigi. Give me the best
set of black holes you've got.

998
01:27:47,038 --> 01:27:49,954
No, no, no, you don't
know what you want.

999
01:27:49,989 --> 01:27:51,985
Luigi know what you want.

1000
01:27:53,270 --> 01:27:57,541
Black wool tires.
They blend into the beam.

1001
01:27:57,576 --> 01:28:01,957
But these, white wool tires basic:

1002
01:28:01,992 --> 01:28:06,476
Look at me! Here I am!
Love me.

1003
01:28:06,511 --> 01:28:07,847
All right, you're the expert!

1004
01:28:09,517 --> 01:28:13,288
- Oh, and don't forget the spare.
- Perfecto. Guido!

1005
01:28:13,323 --> 01:28:13,990
Pit stop!

1006
01:28:26,843 --> 01:28:30,433
- What did Luigi tell you?
- You were right!

1007
01:28:30,468 --> 01:28:33,652
- Better than a Ferrarri, ha?
- Ah, no.

1008
01:28:37,596 --> 01:28:40,006
Wow, this organic fuel is great!

1009
01:28:40,041 --> 01:28:43,304
- Why haven't I heard it about before?
- It's a conspiracy man!

1010
01:28:43,339 --> 01:28:46,145
They all companies got
a grip on a gun man!

1011
01:28:46,180 --> 01:28:51,275
- They feed us a bunch of lives, man.
- Okay, I'll take a case.

1012
01:29:21,466 --> 01:29:22,199
Here she come!

1013
01:29:22,234 --> 01:29:25,220
Okay, places everybody!
All right! Act natural!

1014
01:29:26,186 --> 01:29:27,627
- Hello Sally!
- Hello Sally!

1015
01:29:27,662 --> 01:29:29,134
All right, what's going on?

1016
01:29:29,169 --> 01:29:31,594
Ladies and gentlecars!

1017
01:29:31,629 --> 01:29:35,908
Please welcome the
new Lightning McQueen!

1018
01:29:37,521 --> 01:29:40,348
Well, what do you think? Radiator
Springs looks pretty good on me.

1019
01:29:41,389 --> 01:29:43,578
I'll say aghrr...

1020
01:29:45,763 --> 01:29:48,414
You're gonna fit right in in California.

1021
01:29:49,308 --> 01:29:52,236
Oh my goodness, it looks like
you've helped everybody in town!

1022
01:29:52,271 --> 01:29:54,012
Everybody except one.

1023
01:29:55,594 --> 01:30:00,268
- Hey, is it getting dark out?
- What? What did he say?

1024
01:30:00,303 --> 01:30:01,359
Let me say that again.

1025
01:30:01,394 --> 01:30:03,654
Is it getting dark out!

1026
01:30:03,689 --> 01:30:05,824
Now what does this
much to do after that?

1027
01:30:30,586 --> 01:30:32,451
They fixed the neon.

1028
01:30:40,125 --> 01:30:43,914
- Low and slow?
- Oh yeah, baby!

1029
01:30:49,833 --> 01:30:51,829
Just like in its hayday, right?

1030
01:30:53,095 --> 01:30:55,939
It's even better than I pictured it.
Thank you.

1031
01:31:23,951 --> 01:31:27,557
- Shall we cruise?
- Absolutely, I'd love to!

1032
01:31:27,592 --> 01:31:28,859
Wessie!

1033
01:31:28,894 --> 01:31:33,463
I remember when Stanley first
asked me to take a drive with him...

1034
01:31:33,498 --> 01:31:36,609
Hey miss Sally.
May I have this cruise?

1035
01:31:36,644 --> 01:31:37,826
Of course Mater.

1036
01:31:46,383 --> 01:31:49,862
And then I said - No!
And he asked me again and I said - No!

1037
01:31:50,492 --> 01:31:55,010
Well, he was a persistent
little bugger for a two cilinder.

1038
01:32:07,888 --> 01:32:10,135
- Hey!
- Thanks, Mater.

1039
01:32:10,170 --> 01:32:12,494
Good evening you two.

1040
01:32:14,977 --> 01:32:19,871
Oh, Stanley.
I wish you could see this.

1041
01:32:24,484 --> 01:32:25,958
Is that what I think it is?

1042
01:32:26,730 --> 01:32:29,812
I don't know Flo, I hadn't
had a chance to find out.

1043
01:32:29,847 --> 01:32:33,736
But I am going to find out hello.

1044
01:32:33,771 --> 01:32:38,619
- Not that. That!
- Customers?

1045
01:32:38,654 --> 01:32:41,670
Customers everybody!
And a lot of them!

1046
01:32:41,705 --> 01:32:44,064
You know what to do?
Just let them a huss!

1047
01:32:44,799 --> 01:32:47,293
It's the ghost ride!

1048
01:32:47,328 --> 01:32:50,213
We have found McQueen!
We have found McQueen!

1049
01:32:53,403 --> 01:32:54,422
Oh wait, excuse me.

1050
01:32:54,457 --> 01:32:57,095
- Is that true you've been at rehab?
- Did you have a nervous breakdown, McQueen?

1051
01:32:57,130 --> 01:32:57,779
I'm sorry what?

1052
01:32:59,105 --> 01:33:00,784
Stickers! McQueen!

1053
01:33:00,819 --> 01:33:05,017
- Who's got McQueen prisoner?
- Shoot no, we're best buds!

1054
01:33:05,052 --> 01:33:09,341
I'm riding that, but I can beat
him down you see try to it sky.

1055
01:33:09,376 --> 01:33:10,907
Sally! Sally!

1056
01:33:10,942 --> 01:33:13,335
McQueen, are you still
getting for the Piston cup?

1057
01:33:13,370 --> 01:33:15,473
- Stickers!
- Sally!

1058
01:33:17,651 --> 01:33:18,936
You're here!

1059
01:33:18,971 --> 01:33:22,032
Thanks to manufacturer,
are you all right?

1060
01:33:22,067 --> 01:33:24,009
- Mack?
- You're here!

1061
01:33:24,044 --> 01:33:25,754
I can't beleve it.

1062
01:33:27,220 --> 01:33:29,457
You are a second Stringling light!

1063
01:33:29,492 --> 01:33:32,286
I'm so sorry I was covunce.
I'll make it up to you!

1064
01:33:32,321 --> 01:33:34,304
Mack, I can't believe you're here!

1065
01:33:34,339 --> 01:33:37,891
- Is that the world's fastest racer machine?
- Is that Harv?

1066
01:33:41,650 --> 01:33:43,625
Get back you oil thirsty parasytes!

1067
01:33:45,146 --> 01:33:47,055
Excellent, this is my good siridea.

1068
01:33:47,711 --> 01:33:49,556
Harv! Harv!

1069
01:33:50,936 --> 01:33:53,122
- Harv?
- I'm over here.

1070
01:33:53,157 --> 01:33:54,437
How you're doing body?

1071
01:33:54,472 --> 01:33:57,351
My star client has appeared
on the 'Face Of The Earth'!

1072
01:33:57,386 --> 01:33:59,675
- How do you think I'm doing?
- Harv, I can explain.

1073
01:33:59,710 --> 01:34:02,153
I'm doing great!
You're everywhere baby!

1074
01:34:02,188 --> 01:34:05,645
Radio, TV, the papers. You can't
buy this kind of publicity.

1075
01:34:05,680 --> 01:34:07,231
What do you need me for?

1076
01:34:07,266 --> 01:34:09,485
That's just the bigger speech,
by the way you signed the contract.

1077
01:34:09,520 --> 01:34:12,131
Where are you?
I can't even find you on my GPS!

1078
01:34:12,166 --> 01:34:14,219
I'm in this little town
called Radiator Springs.

1079
01:34:14,254 --> 01:34:17,600
- You know Route 66, it's still here!
- Yeah, that's great kid.

1080
01:34:17,635 --> 01:34:18,937
Play time is over pal.

1081
01:34:18,972 --> 01:34:23,094
While the world's been trying to find you,
Dinoco has has no one to wuw.

1082
01:34:23,129 --> 01:34:24,970
- Who are they gonna wuw?
- Chick.

1083
01:34:25,005 --> 01:34:28,399
Bingo! In fact check out
what's on the plazma right now.

1084
01:34:28,434 --> 01:34:30,745
- Show us the Thunder!
- You want Thunder?

1085
01:34:30,780 --> 01:34:32,001
You want Thunder!

1086
01:34:34,593 --> 01:34:37,899
Hey, that's my bid!
You gotta get to Cally pronto.

1087
01:34:37,934 --> 01:34:41,866
Just get out of Radiation Stinks now,
or Dinoco is history, you hear me?

1088
01:34:41,901 --> 01:34:43,520
Just give me a second here, Harv.

1089
01:34:43,555 --> 01:34:46,398
No, no, where are you going?
Get in the trailer baby!

1090
01:34:47,233 --> 01:34:48,706
You want a bigger trailer?

1091
01:34:53,396 --> 01:34:56,089
Sally, I want you to...

1092
01:34:56,124 --> 01:34:57,557
Look I wish...

1093
01:35:01,061 --> 01:35:03,697
Thank you.
Thanks for everything.

1094
01:35:06,106 --> 01:35:11,592
- That was just the road.
- No, it was much more than that.

1095
01:35:14,866 --> 01:35:17,863
Hey kid, we gotta go.
Harv's going crazy!

1096
01:35:17,898 --> 01:35:20,871
He's gonna have me fired if I don't
get you in the truck right now!

1097
01:35:20,906 --> 01:35:23,518
- Mack, just hold it.
- You should go.

1098
01:35:23,553 --> 01:35:25,842
- I know but...
- Good luck in California.

1099
01:35:28,591 --> 01:35:30,428
I hope you'll find what you're looking for.

1100
01:35:32,950 --> 01:35:34,676
Sally... Sally...

1101
01:35:44,815 --> 01:35:46,734
Come on kid, get in the trailer.

1102
01:35:47,494 --> 01:35:49,373
That's right. Go!

1103
01:35:49,408 --> 01:35:52,767
You're big shot, you're a superstar.

1104
01:35:52,802 --> 01:35:54,816
You don't belong there anyway.

1105
01:36:01,193 --> 01:36:03,253
Hey guys, McQueen's leaving in the truck!

1106
01:36:10,353 --> 01:36:12,558
Hey, are you Doc Hudson?

1107
01:36:12,593 --> 01:36:14,736
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the call.

1108
01:36:23,915 --> 01:36:27,253
- You called them?
- It's best for everyone, Sally.

1109
01:36:27,288 --> 01:36:31,029
Best for everyone?
Or best for you?

1110
01:36:47,741 --> 01:36:50,091
I didn't get to say good-bye to him.

1111
01:37:50,366 --> 01:37:52,302
Hello race fans and
welcome to what has become

1112
01:37:52,337 --> 01:37:55,949
quite simply the biggest event
in the history of racing.

1113
01:37:55,984 --> 01:37:58,019
A three-way battle
for the Piston Cup.

1114
01:37:58,054 --> 01:38:00,612
Bob, there's a crowd of
a nearly 200 thousand cars

1115
01:38:00,647 --> 01:38:02,709
here at the Los Angeles
International Speedway.

1116
01:38:02,744 --> 01:38:07,371
Tickets to this race are hotter than
a blood better seat on a hot summer day.

1117
01:38:07,406 --> 01:38:11,286
The King, Chick Hicks and
Lightning McQueen in a 200 lap.

1118
01:38:11,321 --> 01:38:13,488
Winner takes all, tie break a race.

1119
01:38:13,523 --> 01:38:15,215
Come on, he knew I got
a lot of mouse on way,

1120
01:38:15,250 --> 01:38:18,798
but let me tell you something body,
I've never thought I'd see anything like this!

1121
01:38:18,833 --> 01:38:20,376
Man, this is exciting!

1122
01:38:20,411 --> 01:38:23,571
In fact the country is
almost shut down to watch

1123
01:38:23,606 --> 01:38:27,093
what many experts are calling
the race of the century.

1124
01:38:27,933 --> 01:38:31,799
Hey King, good luck in your last race.
You're sure been in this race good to you.

1125
01:38:31,834 --> 01:38:33,090
Thanks junior, I appreciate it.

1126
01:38:33,727 --> 01:38:37,129
- Hey, be careful out there okay?
- Yeah, ma'am.

1127
01:38:37,164 --> 01:38:40,182
Oh yeah, you wanna the forecast?
I'll do you the forecast.

1128
01:38:40,217 --> 01:38:45,403
A hundred percent chance of Thunder!
Say with me!

1129
01:38:47,214 --> 01:38:49,730
Hey you! No quittens
without a garage pass.

1130
01:38:49,765 --> 01:38:52,639
Oh, it's okay.
Lightning McQueen knows me!

1131
01:38:52,674 --> 01:38:56,017
Hey Marco, it's a beautiful
day for a race, isn't it?

1132
01:38:56,052 --> 01:39:01,117
- Absolutely Mr. Andretti.
- And good morning to you, Fred.

1133
01:39:01,449 --> 01:39:03,351
Mario Andretti knows my name!

1134
01:39:03,386 --> 01:39:05,767
- They gotta let me in now!
- Sorry pal...

1135
01:39:05,802 --> 01:39:10,437
Okay, here we go.
Focus. Speed.

1136
01:39:11,086 --> 01:39:13,746
I am speed.

1137
01:39:15,882 --> 01:39:19,087
Victory. One winner.
Two losers.

1138
01:39:21,562 --> 01:39:27,117
Speed! Speed.
Speed. Speed...

1139
01:39:33,502 --> 01:39:36,323
Yeah, yeah, I'm ready.

1140
01:39:50,076 --> 01:39:52,463
Mack, thanks for being
my pit crew today.

1141
01:39:52,498 --> 01:39:55,163
Don't worry about it kid.
It's the least I could do.

1142
01:39:55,198 --> 01:39:57,659
After all gas can
is my middle name.

1143
01:39:57,694 --> 01:39:59,802
- It is?
- Yeah, not really.

1144
01:40:11,569 --> 01:40:13,998
PISTON CUP

1145
01:40:29,868 --> 01:40:32,660
Nausing, zoom in 20-16, 10-16.

1146
01:40:32,695 --> 01:40:36,242
And there he is, Lightning McQueen
missing all week

1147
01:40:36,277 --> 01:40:37,812
and then he turns up
in the middle of nowhere!

1148
01:40:37,847 --> 01:40:43,066
In a little town called Radiator Springs
where in quite law tiles of all things.

1149
01:40:49,461 --> 01:40:51,820
Hey where you've been McQueen?
I've been kinda lonely.

1150
01:40:51,855 --> 01:40:54,672
Nobody to hang out with.
I mean except the Dinoco falks.

1151
01:40:54,707 --> 01:40:56,095
Oh, and the twins of course.

1152
01:40:56,130 --> 01:40:58,559
You know the twins used to be your fans,
but now they're my fans.

1153
01:40:58,594 --> 01:41:00,855
Anyway, listen to what the twins say...

1154
01:41:10,955 --> 01:41:12,206
Let's go race it!

1155
01:41:19,890 --> 01:41:22,843
- Come on, you can do it!
- Come on King, we're just proud boy!

1156
01:41:24,393 --> 01:41:27,984
Fifty laps down and The King
is still holding a slim lead.

1157
01:41:28,019 --> 01:41:30,998
And McQueen's gotta run on him!
He's looking to the inside!

1158
01:41:32,805 --> 01:41:35,044
Oh, he slammed the door on him!

1159
01:41:35,079 --> 01:41:37,471
Chicks not making an
easy autumn today.

1160
01:41:37,506 --> 01:41:41,158
Man, he go so much formittable,
now he's gonna chasing back down.

1161
01:41:51,131 --> 01:41:53,334
Oh, McQueen spins out on the in-field.

1162
01:41:57,131 --> 01:41:59,652
Ha-ha! Just me and
the old man, fellows.

1163
01:41:59,687 --> 01:42:01,272
McQueen just settled
the weather today.

1164
01:42:04,355 --> 01:42:07,029
- Hey kid, are you all right?
- I don't know Mack.

1165
01:42:09,285 --> 01:42:10,406
I don't think I...

1166
01:42:10,441 --> 01:42:12,750
I didn't come all this
way to see you quit.

1167
01:42:12,785 --> 01:42:13,666
Doc?

1168
01:42:17,287 --> 01:42:20,036
Guys, you're here!
I can't believe this!

1169
01:42:20,071 --> 01:42:23,641
I knew you needed a crew, chief.
But I didn't know it was this bad.

1170
01:42:23,676 --> 01:42:25,421
I thought you said
you'd never come back.

1171
01:42:25,456 --> 01:42:29,391
Well, I really didn't have a choice.
Mater didn't get to say good-bye.

1172
01:42:29,426 --> 01:42:32,244
Good-bye!
Okay, I'm good.

1173
01:42:34,252 --> 01:42:35,222
RADIATOR SPRINGS
RACING TEAM

1174
01:42:36,851 --> 01:42:39,949
All right, you can ride as
good as you can fix the road,

1175
01:42:39,984 --> 01:42:43,034
then you can win this race
with your eyes shut.

1176
01:42:43,069 --> 01:42:44,532
Now get back out there!

1177
01:42:47,440 --> 01:42:49,448
Hot snock, we are back in business.

1178
01:42:49,483 --> 01:42:52,646
Guido, Luigi, you're going up against
professional pick cruise boys.

1179
01:42:52,681 --> 01:42:54,068
You're gonna have to be fast.

1180
01:42:54,103 --> 01:42:55,861
They will not know what bit them!

1181
01:42:55,896 --> 01:42:57,874
Kid, you can beat these guys.

1182
01:42:57,909 --> 01:43:01,266
Fine the groove that works
for you and get that lap back.

1183
01:43:13,144 --> 01:43:14,583
- Is it?
- That's him!

1184
01:43:14,618 --> 01:43:16,544
Is that...
That's the Hudson Hornet!

1185
01:43:16,579 --> 01:43:18,400
Bob, Darrell,
the Hudson Hornet is back!

1186
01:43:18,435 --> 01:43:21,010
Darrell, it appears McQueen
has got himself a pit crew.

1187
01:43:21,045 --> 01:43:23,552
And look who he has for a crew chief.

1188
01:43:23,587 --> 01:43:26,129
Wow, look man, this is a Hudson Hornet!

1189
01:43:26,164 --> 01:43:29,840
- Big man, call me slick!
- He surely is!

1190
01:43:34,677 --> 01:43:36,025
Wow, this is history in the making.

1191
01:43:36,060 --> 01:43:39,692
Nobody has seen the racing
legend in over 50 years!

1192
01:43:39,727 --> 01:43:43,267
Hey Doc! Come look at this
from the home avenue.

1193
01:43:43,302 --> 01:43:45,064
He looks just like you!

1194
01:43:50,453 --> 01:43:54,199
- McQueen has his the lonely inside!
- But he's still nearly a lap failed!

1195
01:43:54,234 --> 01:43:56,930
And he catches up to them
with only 60 laps to go!

1196
01:43:56,965 --> 01:43:59,390
You're going great kid,
just keep your head up.

1197
01:43:59,425 --> 01:44:04,316
- All right! Right! Right!
- Hey trippy, where did McQueen find you?

1198
01:44:04,351 --> 01:44:08,402
Those round things are called tires.
And they go under the car!

1199
01:44:11,358 --> 01:44:14,958
No, you will have your chance,
we know you will have your chance.

1200
01:44:30,582 --> 01:44:32,494
Kid's just trying to be a hero, ha?

1201
01:44:33,367 --> 01:44:34,593
What do you think of this?

1202
01:44:35,686 --> 01:44:37,116
Yeah, that's it, kid!

1203
01:44:40,705 --> 01:44:41,630
What?

1204
01:44:41,665 --> 01:44:43,598
Wow! Get him at!

1205
01:44:47,082 --> 01:44:48,445
I taught him that.

1206
01:44:50,139 --> 01:44:52,474
What a move by McQueen,
he's caught up to the leaders.

1207
01:44:52,509 --> 01:44:54,491
Oh yeah, this is what it's all about!

1208
01:44:54,526 --> 01:44:57,503
Three way barrel for
the lead with ten to go!

1209
01:45:03,045 --> 01:45:04,704
Look at that boy go right there!

1210
01:45:14,011 --> 01:45:15,103
Yeah, well you're dumped.

1211
01:45:18,911 --> 01:45:21,913
- Doc I'm flat, I'm flat!
- Can you get back to the pits?

1212
01:45:21,948 --> 01:45:25,571
- Yeah, I think so.
- Hey, got a yellow, bring it in.

1213
01:45:25,606 --> 01:45:27,307
Don't tear yourself up, kid.

1214
01:45:29,986 --> 01:45:31,022
We gotta get him back there fast!

1215
01:45:31,057 --> 01:45:34,095
Or we're gonna be a lot down
movement ever to win this race!

1216
01:45:34,130 --> 01:45:36,395
Guido, it's time.

1217
01:45:40,868 --> 01:45:43,174
Hey tiny, you're gonna
clean his windshield?

1218
01:45:53,149 --> 01:45:54,264
I don't believe it!

1219
01:45:54,299 --> 01:45:56,243
That was the fastest
pit stop I've ever seen!

1220
01:45:56,278 --> 01:45:58,955
He was in brace stop but he's still
gotta be careful at brace car out.

1221
01:45:58,990 --> 01:45:59,973
It's gonna be close!

1222
01:46:04,790 --> 01:46:06,462
Yeah, back in the race!

1223
01:46:07,535 --> 01:46:08,440
Pit stop.

1224
01:46:10,437 --> 01:46:11,171
Guido!

1225
01:46:27,448 --> 01:46:31,218
This is it, we're having another final lap
and McQueen is right behind the leaders.

1226
01:46:31,253 --> 01:46:32,509
What a combat!

1227
01:46:32,544 --> 01:46:36,161
199 laps and baby it
all comes down to this!

1228
01:46:36,196 --> 01:46:40,123
This is it kiddo, you got
four turns left one at the time.

1229
01:46:40,158 --> 01:46:43,550
Drive in deep and hope it sticks. Go!

1230
01:46:48,870 --> 01:46:50,420
McQueen is going inside.

1231
01:46:54,138 --> 01:46:57,118
- Chick and The King are loose.
- I think McQueen is out of the race!

1232
01:47:07,755 --> 01:47:09,901
- McQueen saves!
- He's back on the track!

1233
01:47:10,745 --> 01:47:13,244
- Hope like a Cadillacs?
- Steam like a Beemer!

1234
01:47:20,519 --> 01:47:22,737
Lightning McQueen is
gonna win the Piston Cup!

1235
01:47:22,772 --> 01:47:24,663
Come on! You've got it,
you've got it, Stickers!

1236
01:47:27,622 --> 01:47:29,869
I'm not coming in again
behind you, old man.

1237
01:47:40,454 --> 01:47:41,165
Oh, no!

1238
01:48:00,511 --> 01:48:03,077
Yeah! Woo-hoo!

1239
01:48:03,112 --> 01:48:05,029
I won baby! Yeah!

1240
01:48:07,873 --> 01:48:09,780
What's he up to Doc?

1241
01:48:20,963 --> 01:48:22,215
What are you doing, kid?

1242
01:48:22,250 --> 01:48:24,289
I think The King should
finish his last race.

1243
01:48:28,635 --> 01:48:31,799
You just gave up a Piston Cup,
you know that?

1244
01:48:31,834 --> 01:48:35,071
Ah, it's curn field race car and
no one's told me something.

1245
01:48:35,106 --> 01:48:36,781
It's just an empty cup.

1246
01:48:39,606 --> 01:48:41,917
Darrell, is pushing
on the last cup legal?

1247
01:48:41,952 --> 01:48:45,522
Hey man, he's not really pushing him,
he's just giving him a little pump rap.

1248
01:48:48,551 --> 01:48:50,650
Hey! What?
What's going on?

1249
01:48:50,685 --> 01:48:52,749
That's a lot of racing out there.

1250
01:49:09,176 --> 01:49:11,994
- We're all mo and the mio mit.
- Way to go, body!

1251
01:49:12,029 --> 01:49:14,581
There's a lot of love out there,
you know man?

1252
01:49:14,616 --> 01:49:16,843
Don't embarass me Filmore.

1253
01:49:16,878 --> 01:49:19,181
That's my Hotrod.

1254
01:49:21,704 --> 01:49:24,859
Come on baby, bring it out!
Bring out the Piston Cup!

1255
01:49:26,647 --> 01:49:29,067
Yeah, now that's
what I'm talking about!

1256
01:49:29,102 --> 01:49:32,129
Hey! How come the only
one's celebrating is me?

1257
01:49:32,164 --> 01:49:34,574
Where are the girls?
Bring on the confetti!

1258
01:49:36,015 --> 01:49:38,526
Easy with the confetti,
what's going on?

1259
01:49:38,561 --> 01:49:41,149
Come on snap some pictures,
I gotta go sign my deal with Dinoco!

1260
01:49:41,730 --> 01:49:42,468
Say with me!

1261
01:49:45,458 --> 01:49:46,416
What's wrong with everybody?

1262
01:49:49,043 --> 01:49:50,251
This is now Chick era!

1263
01:49:56,336 --> 01:49:58,444
- Thanks, Lightning.
- You're welcome.

1264
01:50:00,784 --> 01:50:02,361
Way to go King!

1265
01:50:15,994 --> 01:50:17,715
You made us proud, kid.

1266
01:50:17,750 --> 01:50:19,426
Congrats on a loss, bucko.

1267
01:50:23,095 --> 01:50:26,889
- You got a lot of stuff, kid.
- Thanks, Doc.

1268
01:50:27,963 --> 01:50:32,090
Hey Lightning, how about coming over
to me and talking for a minute?

1269
01:50:32,125 --> 01:50:36,066
Son, now that was some
real racing out there.

1270
01:50:36,101 --> 01:50:39,062
How'd you like to become
the new face of Dinoco?

1271
01:50:43,438 --> 01:50:45,128
But I didn't win.

1272
01:50:45,163 --> 01:50:49,145
Lightning, there's a whole lot more
to racing, than just winning.

1273
01:50:56,144 --> 01:51:01,329
Thank you Mr. Tex, but these Rust-eze
guys over there gave me my big break.

1274
01:51:03,139 --> 01:51:08,304
- I wanna stand with them.
- Well, I sure can respect that.

1275
01:51:08,339 --> 01:51:12,303
Still you know if there's
ever anything I can do for you,

1276
01:51:12,338 --> 01:51:13,190
just let me know.

1277
01:51:13,225 --> 01:51:15,646
I sure appreciate that.
Thank you.

1278
01:51:17,084 --> 01:51:20,225
Actually, there is one thing.

1279
01:51:23,297 --> 01:51:26,335
Hey look at me!
I'm flying!

1280
01:51:31,649 --> 01:51:34,659
I'm happy in the tornado
in the traid parlots!

1281
01:51:37,996 --> 01:51:40,659
Do you think it's about
the time we redecorate?

1282
01:51:44,366 --> 01:51:48,386
Hi, Lightning Mcqueen told me this was
the best place in the world to get tires.

1283
01:51:48,421 --> 01:51:51,369
How about setting me and my friends up
with three full sets each?

1284
01:51:53,716 --> 01:51:56,604
It's a real Michael Shumacher Ferrari!

1285
01:51:58,178 --> 01:52:00,069
A real Ferrari!

1286
01:52:00,104 --> 01:52:02,417
Punch me Guido.
Punch me in the face.

1287
01:52:02,452 --> 01:52:05,793
This is the most glorious day of my life.

1288
01:52:29,522 --> 01:52:30,856
Just passing through?

1289
01:52:30,891 --> 01:52:32,987
Actually I thought stuff and stay a while.

1290
01:52:33,022 --> 01:52:35,092
I hear this place is back on the map.

1291
01:52:35,127 --> 01:52:36,310
It is?

1292
01:52:36,345 --> 01:52:38,070
Yeah, there's some rumor floating around

1293
01:52:38,105 --> 01:52:43,192
that some hot shot Piston Cup race car's
setting up his big racing headquarters here.

1294
01:52:43,227 --> 01:52:45,838
Really? Oh, well there goes the town.

1295
01:52:45,873 --> 01:52:48,001
I really missed you Sally.

1296
01:52:48,993 --> 01:52:51,606
Well I create feelings in others

1297
01:52:51,641 --> 01:52:54,517
don't understand and
blah, blah, blah, blah.

1298
01:52:55,852 --> 01:52:58,562
McQueen and Sally,
hard to make on three!

1299
01:52:58,597 --> 01:53:03,068
Hey ya ask is I in teen!

1300
01:53:03,103 --> 01:53:05,139
Pretty timing Mater!

1301
01:53:09,873 --> 01:53:11,939
It's my best friend,
what you're gonna do.

1302
01:53:11,974 --> 01:53:14,856
So Stickers, last one
that flows buys?

1303
01:53:14,891 --> 01:53:17,403
I don't know, why don't
we just take a drive?

1304
01:53:17,438 --> 01:53:19,600
Hm.. Nah.
