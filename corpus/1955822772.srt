WOMAN: "The young princess,
you may be sure,

15
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:49,181
was not long in saying yes
to all of this.

16
00:00:49,216 --> 00:00:51,516
As they spoke,
a royal coach drove up

17
00:00:51,552 --> 00:00:53,652
with eight beautiful horses

18
00:00:53,687 --> 00:00:56,555
decked with plumes of feathers
and a golden harness.

19
00:00:56,590 --> 00:00:59,691
They then took leave of the king
and got into the coach,

20
00:00:59,726 --> 00:01:01,860
and all set out
full of joy and merriment

21
00:01:01,895 --> 00:01:05,197
for the prince's kingdom,
which they reached safely.

22
00:01:05,232 --> 00:01:08,834
And there they lived
a happily great many years."

23
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:10,902
And there you have it,
<i>The Frog Prince.</i>

24
00:01:10,972 --> 00:01:12,237
Still one of my favorites.

25
00:01:12,306 --> 00:01:13,672
I hope you all enjoyed it

26
00:01:13,707 --> 00:01:16,475
as much as I enjoyed
sharing it with you.

27
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:19,511
And let's all show Miss Marks
how much we enjoyed

28
00:01:19,546 --> 00:01:21,746
having her read to us
this semester.

29
00:01:27,221 --> 00:01:29,588
Thank you so much
for your help.

30
00:01:29,656 --> 00:01:31,490
Good luck on your interview.

31
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:32,591
Thank you.

32
00:01:39,367 --> 00:01:42,734
Finished top of your class.
Good.

33
00:01:42,803 --> 00:01:45,504
The City Literacy Program,
what's that?

34
00:01:45,539 --> 00:01:47,139
They send volunteers
to read with kids

35
00:01:47,174 --> 00:01:48,573
in inner-city schools.

36
00:01:48,642 --> 00:01:49,908
All through law school?

37
00:01:49,977 --> 00:01:51,510
- Yes.
- You had time?

38
00:01:51,545 --> 00:01:54,546
Yeah, I made the time.

39
00:01:54,581 --> 00:01:56,748
I love working with children.

40
00:01:56,817 --> 00:02:00,419
Maggie, let me be really clear.

41
00:02:00,488 --> 00:02:04,189
We need somebody razor sharp,
focused, committed 200%,

42
00:02:04,225 --> 00:02:05,190
rain or shine.

43
00:02:05,226 --> 00:02:06,992
Absolutely.

44
00:02:07,028 --> 00:02:09,061
Once you're on the team,
there isn't time for much else.

45
00:02:09,096 --> 00:02:10,896
Are we clear on that?

46
00:02:10,931 --> 00:02:13,032
Clear as rain.

47
00:02:13,067 --> 00:02:15,867
I mean glass.
I mean...

48
00:02:15,903 --> 00:02:18,337
very, very clear.

49
00:02:21,475 --> 00:02:25,044
That was tough.
A lot tougher than I expected.

50
00:02:25,079 --> 00:02:27,712
She was just testing you.
They're a top firm.

51
00:02:27,748 --> 00:02:29,081
They're weeding out the weak.

52
00:02:29,150 --> 00:02:30,715
That's me, the weak.

53
00:02:30,751 --> 00:02:32,851
No, you are not.

54
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:35,354
They want commitment,
you can commit.

55
00:02:35,389 --> 00:02:38,657
Honestly, I don't know
if I'm cut out for this.

56
00:02:38,692 --> 00:02:41,760
So you try a smaller outfit,
something more boutique.

57
00:02:41,828 --> 00:02:43,995
Yeah, that'll go over
really well my dad.

58
00:02:44,031 --> 00:02:46,265
"Boutique is for shoes.
You need a top firm."

59
00:02:46,333 --> 00:02:48,233
Okay, I'm no lawyer,
but there are--

60
00:02:48,302 --> 00:02:49,501
It's not just that.

61
00:02:49,537 --> 00:02:51,203
The bigger question is,

62
00:02:51,238 --> 00:02:54,239
do I really wanna be
cooped up in an office 24/7,

63
00:02:54,308 --> 00:02:57,042
surrounded by guys--
yes, mostly guys--

64
00:02:57,078 --> 00:02:58,643
clawing their way
up to partner

65
00:02:58,679 --> 00:03:00,645
while doing meaningless work
that helps no one

66
00:03:00,681 --> 00:03:04,383
but some corporation's
bottom line for years?

67
00:03:04,418 --> 00:03:05,917
You know what?

68
00:03:05,986 --> 00:03:08,420
You are stressed out.
You're exhausted.

69
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:11,523
It's not the best time
to be making life decisions.

70
00:03:11,559 --> 00:03:15,227
Which is what I wanted
to talk to you about.

71
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:17,496
Come to Europe with me.

72
00:03:17,531 --> 00:03:19,498
What? No.

73
00:03:19,533 --> 00:03:21,032
- Why not?
- Even if I could,

74
00:03:21,068 --> 00:03:23,235
I cannot handle
your friend Jenny for two weeks.

75
00:03:23,304 --> 00:03:26,071
And that's just it.
Jenny canceled. She got a job.

76
00:03:26,140 --> 00:03:28,173
That's what I need, a job.

77
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:30,175
Look, they said they'd get
back to you in two weeks.

78
00:03:30,211 --> 00:03:31,743
It's the perfect time
for a getaway.

79
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:34,879
I got it all set.
All you need to do is show up.

80
00:03:34,915 --> 00:03:37,716
Trust me, you'll have
way more fun without me.

81
00:03:37,751 --> 00:03:41,520
Maggie Marks, when's
the last time you had fun?

82
00:03:41,555 --> 00:03:43,855
From LSATs through law school,
the bar exam,

83
00:03:43,890 --> 00:03:46,691
you've had your head in the
books for how many years now?

84
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:48,893
You're the spontaneous one,
not me.

85
00:03:48,929 --> 00:03:51,597
It's not you, which is exactly
why you should do it.

86
00:03:51,665 --> 00:03:53,565
You said so yourself.

87
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:57,169
Don't you wanna live a little
before it's all billable hours,

88
00:03:57,204 --> 00:04:00,372
cooped up in an office 24/7?

89
00:04:01,908 --> 00:04:03,708
Where are you going again?

90
00:04:05,679 --> 00:04:08,180
MAN: Calpurnia?
Where's that?

91
00:04:08,215 --> 00:04:11,750
Europe. It's southwest
of the French Alps.

92
00:04:11,818 --> 00:04:13,552
Here we go.
Big enough?

93
00:04:13,587 --> 00:04:17,055
Yeah, that's perfect.
Thanks, Mom.

94
00:04:17,090 --> 00:04:18,757
And you'd be gone
two whole weeks?

95
00:04:18,825 --> 00:04:20,759
What if they want you back
for a follow-up interview

96
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:22,261
while you're away?

97
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,196
Then you'll buy her
a new return ticket.

98
00:04:24,231 --> 00:04:25,897
You can afford it.

99
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,366
Here.

100
00:04:27,401 --> 00:04:31,403
"Calpurnia, a virtual
winter wonderland".

101
00:04:31,472 --> 00:04:34,873
It really is a proper kingdom
with its own royal family.

102
00:04:34,908 --> 00:04:38,843
"The perfect mixture
of quaint and romantic".

103
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:41,813
Who knows? You might even meet
a nice European gentleman.

104
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,583
Mom, please. That is
the last thing I need right now.

105
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:47,319
- She needs to focus on work.
- She needs a break.

106
00:04:47,354 --> 00:04:49,921
Oh, hang on.
I have something else for you.

107
00:04:57,164 --> 00:04:58,664
I did try my best.

108
00:04:58,699 --> 00:05:01,567
You had one tough interview.

109
00:05:01,602 --> 00:05:04,336
- I'll call.
- Please don't, Dad.

110
00:05:04,371 --> 00:05:09,575
Look, I know you wanna help
but you gotta let me do this.

111
00:05:09,643 --> 00:05:12,010
Or maybe I just can't.
I don't know.

112
00:05:17,851 --> 00:05:20,018
Of course you're anxious.

113
00:05:20,053 --> 00:05:21,220
It's natural.

114
00:05:24,991 --> 00:05:28,560
But you're the toughest
and smartest gal I know.

115
00:05:28,596 --> 00:05:30,395
Thanks, Dad.

116
00:05:30,431 --> 00:05:32,531
Here we go!

117
00:05:32,566 --> 00:05:34,766
Winter wonderland looks cold.

118
00:05:34,835 --> 00:05:36,067
[laughing]

119
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:38,403
I love you, Mom.

120
00:05:38,472 --> 00:05:40,505
I love you, too, honey.

121
00:05:52,753 --> 00:05:54,185
MAN: Let's see then.

122
00:05:54,221 --> 00:05:57,822
Today you've got
a luncheon at noon,

123
00:05:57,858 --> 00:06:01,326
followed by a meeting with
the chief of staff at 12:55.

124
00:06:01,362 --> 00:06:08,367
He requested the full hour to
review your coronation speech.

125
00:06:09,069 --> 00:06:12,070
Then a 2 p.m. fitting
with the tailor and his team

126
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:13,838
for your coronation uniform.

127
00:06:13,874 --> 00:06:16,141
- Whoa, no, hold on, hold on.
- Highness?

128
00:06:16,176 --> 00:06:20,312
Mother just left a five-minute
gap between 1:55 and 2 p.m.

129
00:06:20,347 --> 00:06:22,714
I'm not sure I'll know
what to do with myself

130
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,883
for those 300 seconds.

131
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:26,551
[laughing]

132
00:06:26,587 --> 00:06:28,754
[phone vibrates]

133
00:06:31,392 --> 00:06:33,525
Ah, speak of the...

134
00:06:36,029 --> 00:06:37,529
...queen bee.

135
00:06:37,564 --> 00:06:43,669
Her Majesty requests
your presence immediately.

136
00:06:43,704 --> 00:06:46,371
It's in all caps.

137
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:48,840
That's me done for.
I blame you.

138
00:06:48,875 --> 00:06:51,142
You're the one
who showed her how to text.

139
00:06:51,178 --> 00:06:54,078
It's fine. Just tell her
I'll be down in a minute.

140
00:07:06,527 --> 00:07:07,726
Thank you.

141
00:07:12,065 --> 00:07:13,532
Good morning, Mother.

142
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:16,201
Good morning, Dory,
gentlemen.

143
00:07:20,374 --> 00:07:24,142
You made the papers... again.

144
00:07:24,177 --> 00:07:27,479
Must be a slow news day...
again.

145
00:07:32,386 --> 00:07:34,419
This is ridiculous.

146
00:07:34,488 --> 00:07:36,588
She was a tourist.
I was giving her directions.

147
00:07:36,657 --> 00:07:38,857
You certainly seem
very happy doing it.

148
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:41,159
- Mother, seriously--
- You have to be careful,

149
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:43,061
especially with
your coronation coming up.

150
00:07:43,096 --> 00:07:45,864
More so than ever, you represent
not only our family,

151
00:07:45,899 --> 00:07:47,833
but the entire country.

152
00:07:47,868 --> 00:07:51,703
So we want to present
Calpurnians as what, exactly?

153
00:07:51,739 --> 00:07:53,872
A surly, unsmiling lot
who are rude to tourists?

154
00:07:53,907 --> 00:07:56,307
Don't dare be daft.
You know exactly what I mean.

155
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:59,644
I want you to limit
your gallivanting about town

156
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:01,847
in this last stretch
before the coronation.

157
00:08:01,882 --> 00:08:03,648
I'm not staying cooped up
in here for a week

158
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:05,751
because some trashy tabloid
prints lies.

159
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:08,086
Your father,
may he rest in peace,

160
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,589
had a wonderful saying:
"Sacrifice in--"

161
00:08:10,657 --> 00:08:13,258
"Sacrifice in service of
your country is not sacrifice."

162
00:08:13,326 --> 00:08:15,026
Yes. I don't think
he meant it to include

163
00:08:15,061 --> 00:08:16,695
house arrest for his son.

164
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:19,765
Very well.
In that case, I must insist

165
00:08:19,833 --> 00:08:22,534
that Felix go with you
on your little outings

166
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:24,035
- at all times.
- Mother!

167
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:30,375
Fine.

168
00:08:30,411 --> 00:08:31,976
Fine.

169
00:08:32,012 --> 00:08:34,479
I will consent
to be chaperoned

170
00:08:34,515 --> 00:08:36,481
if you consider
my previous request.

171
00:08:36,517 --> 00:08:37,916
Absolutely not.

172
00:08:37,984 --> 00:08:40,419
I'm not turning
a centuries-old tradition

173
00:08:40,487 --> 00:08:42,186
into a public free-for-all.

174
00:08:42,222 --> 00:08:43,922
Why shouldn't the coronation
be open to the public?

175
00:08:43,990 --> 00:08:45,424
They're our citizens.

176
00:08:45,492 --> 00:08:47,225
If not for them,
we wouldn't have a country.

177
00:08:47,260 --> 00:08:49,928
Adrian, the coronation is
one of the few traditions

178
00:08:49,996 --> 00:08:51,730
the noble families have left.

179
00:08:51,765 --> 00:08:54,766
I will not take it away
from them, from us.

180
00:08:54,835 --> 00:08:57,969
- Yes, but--
- I won't discuss it further.

181
00:09:00,307 --> 00:09:02,541
Fine.

182
00:09:02,576 --> 00:09:04,810
Well, then I guess
I'm free to roam,

183
00:09:04,845 --> 00:09:06,711
sans chaperone.

184
00:09:08,515 --> 00:09:12,417
I'll try not to disrupt
the almighty schedule too much.

185
00:09:24,598 --> 00:09:26,932
SARAH: Yes, yes, yes,
you need a new hat.

186
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,399
MAGGIE: I'm okay, really.

187
00:09:28,435 --> 00:09:31,503
- These are classy.
- Okay, let's see.

188
00:09:31,538 --> 00:09:34,205
How about this one?

189
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:36,675
Mm, I don't know.

190
00:09:38,378 --> 00:09:40,078
I look silly.

191
00:09:40,146 --> 00:09:42,547
You look adorable.

192
00:09:42,583 --> 00:09:44,883
- She'll take it.
- Thank you.

193
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:46,718
Thanks. And thank you.

194
00:09:46,753 --> 00:09:48,319
You're welcome.

195
00:09:48,355 --> 00:09:50,321
It's definitely you.

196
00:09:50,357 --> 00:09:53,157
And if we're lucky,
the new you.

197
00:09:53,193 --> 00:09:57,028
- What are you doing?
- Nothing.

198
00:09:57,063 --> 00:09:59,764
Stop checking your emails!
We're on vacation.

199
00:09:59,833 --> 00:10:02,868
We're supposed to be
having an adventure, not--

200
00:10:02,903 --> 00:10:05,336
Here, give me that.

201
00:10:05,372 --> 00:10:08,072
This is all you need.

202
00:10:08,141 --> 00:10:11,910
You can have your phone back
when you start having fun.

203
00:10:11,979 --> 00:10:14,746
Let's see,
the Forever Fountain.

204
00:10:14,815 --> 00:10:18,149
Legend has it that if you
throw in a coin and make a wish,

205
00:10:18,184 --> 00:10:19,350
it'll come true.

206
00:10:19,386 --> 00:10:21,987
Okay, let me give this a try.

207
00:10:24,925 --> 00:10:26,324
What'd you wish for?

208
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,726
For you to lighten up.

209
00:10:27,761 --> 00:10:29,360
I will, I promise.

210
00:10:29,396 --> 00:10:33,097
Good, 'cause what happens
in Calpurnia,

211
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:35,366
stays in Calpurnia.

212
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:38,069
I think we need
to go on a tour

213
00:10:38,104 --> 00:10:40,639
with that tour guide.

214
00:10:40,674 --> 00:10:43,642
No, thanks. The last thing
I need is guy trouble.

215
00:10:43,677 --> 00:10:46,244
It's not guy trouble
if it's the right guy.

216
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:50,481
You go. Honestly, I wouldn't
mind wandering around for a bit.

217
00:10:50,517 --> 00:10:52,050
I'll be fine.

218
00:10:52,085 --> 00:10:54,586
Let's meet at the hotel
at four,

219
00:10:54,655 --> 00:10:57,088
and we'll figure out
dinner, okay?

220
00:10:57,157 --> 00:10:58,723
Okay, thanks.

221
00:10:58,759 --> 00:10:59,858
[giggling]

222
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:00,892
Hey, my phone.

223
00:11:03,564 --> 00:11:06,998
Okay, I'll give it back to you
on one condition.

224
00:11:07,034 --> 00:11:09,568
You have to do something
adventurous today.

225
00:11:09,603 --> 00:11:12,103
Something not you.

226
00:11:12,138 --> 00:11:13,638
Deal.

227
00:11:14,708 --> 00:11:16,641
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

228
00:11:38,431 --> 00:11:39,564
[gasps]

229
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:43,702
- [horn honks]
- Watch out!

230
00:11:43,737 --> 00:11:44,903
Hey!

231
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52,210
Watch where you're going!

232
00:12:06,159 --> 00:12:09,494
Hey! Hey!

233
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,331
Come back!

234
00:12:24,210 --> 00:12:27,211
I guess that qualifies
as an adventure.

235
00:12:44,931 --> 00:12:47,398
Looking for this?

236
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:48,499
You!

237
00:12:48,535 --> 00:12:50,268
'Tis indeed I.

238
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:53,972
And this, I believe, is yours,
with my apologies.

239
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:55,073
Sorry.

240
00:12:55,142 --> 00:12:57,976
How did you clean it up
so fast?

241
00:12:58,011 --> 00:12:59,978
Magic.

242
00:13:00,013 --> 00:13:02,714
Did the store have
the same one?

243
00:13:02,749 --> 00:13:06,017
I will tell you
on one condition.

244
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:07,852
It's an ancient
Calpurnian custom

245
00:13:07,888 --> 00:13:11,222
that a knight on horseback
who rudely tramples a lady's hat

246
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:13,091
buys her a latte.

247
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:16,928
That's cute,
but I gotta run.

248
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:20,999
Run if you must, but aren't you
forgetting something?

249
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:23,334
If you're looking
for another thank you--

250
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,705
Oh, no, I meant this.

251
00:13:29,542 --> 00:13:32,844
How did you--
Give me that back.

252
00:13:32,879 --> 00:13:34,145
How did you do that?

253
00:13:34,181 --> 00:13:37,015
A magician never reveals
his secrets,

254
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:39,884
unless he's plied
with very strong coffee.

255
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:42,253
No, honestly, I can't.

256
00:13:42,322 --> 00:13:44,723
The whole spontaneous thing,
it's not really me.

257
00:13:44,758 --> 00:13:46,424
How about tonight?

258
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:49,861
Tonight is definitely
less spontaneous than right now.

259
00:13:49,896 --> 00:13:52,496
- Uh...
- You know what?

260
00:13:52,532 --> 00:13:56,334
Don't answer.
Let's just leave it to mystery.

261
00:13:56,369 --> 00:14:00,171
If you decide to come,
meet me at the fountain at 8:30.

262
00:14:00,207 --> 00:14:02,473
If you decide otherwise,

263
00:14:02,508 --> 00:14:05,977
well, then I hope you enjoy
our little kingdom.

264
00:14:06,012 --> 00:14:08,579
I'm enjoying it already.

265
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:14,185
I'm enjoying it already?

266
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:17,555
I'm enjoying it already.
What is wrong with you?

267
00:14:22,229 --> 00:14:24,595
- Good day, Your Highness.
- Mr. Wickford!

268
00:14:24,664 --> 00:14:27,265
How fares the hardest-working
chief of staff in the land?

269
00:14:27,333 --> 00:14:29,100
Well, sir,
I can't complain.

270
00:14:29,169 --> 00:14:32,536
It's very kind of Her Majesty
to lend us her office.

271
00:14:32,572 --> 00:14:35,140
My mother is nothing
if not generous.

272
00:14:35,175 --> 00:14:36,641
Sorry I'm late.

273
00:14:36,676 --> 00:14:38,843
No apologies necessary.

274
00:14:38,879 --> 00:14:42,480
To save us a little time,

275
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:44,682
I've drafted something
we could use

276
00:14:44,717 --> 00:14:47,018
as a template
for your coronation speech.

277
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:49,420
Great, thank you.

278
00:14:49,489 --> 00:14:52,390
"Citizens of Calpurnia,
assembled members of..."

279
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:55,894
Assembled members.

280
00:14:55,929 --> 00:14:57,996
Sounds like something
out of Frankenstein.

281
00:14:58,031 --> 00:14:59,430
[chuckling]
Of course.

282
00:14:59,499 --> 00:15:01,532
Well, we can can always
adjust later.

283
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,402
"As your future monarch,
I solemnly pledge--"

284
00:15:04,437 --> 00:15:07,538
Nope, not "solemn."
It's not a funeral.

285
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:11,709
Wickford...

286
00:15:11,744 --> 00:15:14,312
can I ask you something
a bit off-topic?

287
00:15:14,347 --> 00:15:16,347
Of course.

288
00:15:16,382 --> 00:15:17,816
What are your thoughts

289
00:15:17,851 --> 00:15:19,918
on opening the coronation up
to the public?

290
00:15:19,986 --> 00:15:21,719
You know, 21st century,

291
00:15:21,754 --> 00:15:23,421
bring the people in
on the process.

292
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,589
- Well, it's not really my--
- Come on, come on.

293
00:15:25,658 --> 00:15:27,692
I'm not looking
for an official position.

294
00:15:27,727 --> 00:15:30,895
Just, you know,
your personal opinion.

295
00:15:30,931 --> 00:15:32,096
[clears throat]

296
00:15:32,165 --> 00:15:35,033
Whilst I admire
your intentions,

297
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:38,069
I feel that the coronation
is a special tradition

298
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:41,039
set aside for
the noble families.

299
00:15:42,575 --> 00:15:46,177
My mother already spoke to you,
didn't she?

300
00:15:47,814 --> 00:15:49,881
Never mind.

301
00:15:49,916 --> 00:15:54,018
"The law of succession
is an immutable--"

302
00:15:54,054 --> 00:15:57,055
I'm sorry.
This sounds nothing like me.

303
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:58,857
Well, to be honest,
Your Highness,

304
00:15:58,892 --> 00:16:02,193
I used your late father's
coronation speech

305
00:16:02,229 --> 00:16:04,896
as a framework
for this draft.

306
00:16:04,931 --> 00:16:10,434
Oh, well,
that explains a lot.

307
00:16:10,503 --> 00:16:13,771
All right, once again,
in case no one's noticed,

308
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:15,340
I'm not my father.

309
00:16:15,375 --> 00:16:17,208
Of course, Your Highness.

310
00:16:17,244 --> 00:16:20,078
And we will adjust
as necessary.

311
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,481
MAGGIE: And then
he asked me out.

312
00:16:23,516 --> 00:16:25,250
A near-miss
with a motorbike?

313
00:16:25,318 --> 00:16:27,986
Yeah, that definitely counts
as an adventure.

314
00:16:28,021 --> 00:16:30,889
- I keep my promises.
- You gonna meet him tonight?

315
00:16:30,924 --> 00:16:32,523
No.

316
00:16:32,558 --> 00:16:34,025
- I don't know, should I?
- Why not?

317
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,994
We're an ocean away
from home.

318
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:38,329
If you don't like him, you don't
ever have to see him again.

319
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:40,765
- I guess. Thank you.
- Thank you.

320
00:16:40,833 --> 00:16:43,601
I could shadow you
if you're worried.

321
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:44,869
You can what?

322
00:16:44,905 --> 00:16:46,371
Go with you,
hang in the background,

323
00:16:46,406 --> 00:16:48,006
make sure he's safe.

324
00:16:48,041 --> 00:16:50,174
What are friends for?

325
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:52,176
Hello, ladies.

326
00:16:52,212 --> 00:16:54,078
Might I interest you
in a souvenir?

327
00:16:54,147 --> 00:16:55,880
I made them myself.

328
00:16:55,916 --> 00:16:58,749
We're raising money
for our school trip to Rome.

329
00:16:58,818 --> 00:17:00,718
What did I tell you?

330
00:17:00,753 --> 00:17:02,486
You may do
your fundraising outside.

331
00:17:02,522 --> 00:17:04,222
You may not disturb
the guests in here.

332
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:06,724
Excuse me,
she wasn't disturbing us.

333
00:17:06,759 --> 00:17:10,094
I was actually just looking
for a souvenir for our trip.

334
00:17:12,332 --> 00:17:14,999
My apologies, mademoiselle.

335
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:17,501
You must understand that
management tends to frown upon--

336
00:17:17,537 --> 00:17:20,338
Students showing leadership
and creativity?

337
00:17:20,373 --> 00:17:21,406
Exactly!

338
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:23,408
I'm a leader,

339
00:17:23,476 --> 00:17:26,210
not to mention creative.

340
00:17:28,548 --> 00:17:29,747
Let's see.

341
00:17:29,816 --> 00:17:31,182
That one looks
really beautiful.

342
00:17:31,217 --> 00:17:32,683
Oh, let me see.

343
00:17:32,718 --> 00:17:33,985
So lovely.

344
00:17:40,193 --> 00:17:42,060
You can quote statistics
all night long,

345
00:17:42,095 --> 00:17:44,662
but the fact is the Arabian
is the only purebred racehorse

346
00:17:44,697 --> 00:17:46,030
left in the world today.

347
00:17:46,066 --> 00:17:48,599
Not quite.
Your Arabian is the oldest,

348
00:17:48,668 --> 00:17:50,534
but still
a human-developed breed,

349
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,003
so not technically pure.

350
00:17:52,038 --> 00:17:54,105
What do you think,
Your Highness?

351
00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:56,207
Oh, I think they should
ask the horses

352
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,476
whether they enjoy racing
in the first place.

353
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,178
The Royal Equestrian Rally

354
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:02,313
is one of your late father's
favorite traditions.

355
00:18:02,349 --> 00:18:05,549
Not all traditions
deserve to be continued.

356
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:08,052
My Lords, if you'll excuse me.

357
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:09,653
Your Highness.

358
00:18:09,689 --> 00:18:11,022
Your Highness.

359
00:18:15,761 --> 00:18:17,161
Ah, there you are.

360
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:19,397
I want to introduce you
to Lady Camilla.

361
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,399
- She's dying to meet you.
- Oh, I--

362
00:18:21,434 --> 00:18:24,735
We need her father's vote in
Parliament on a trade agreement,

363
00:18:24,770 --> 00:18:27,405
unless you have
a more pressing engagement.

364
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:28,506
No.

365
00:18:28,541 --> 00:18:30,174
Then come.

366
00:18:30,210 --> 00:18:34,245
Lady Camilla, may I present
my son Prince Adrian.

367
00:18:34,314 --> 00:18:37,882
Your Highness,
I am so delighted to meet you.

368
00:18:37,917 --> 00:18:40,184
Pleasure is all mine.

369
00:18:48,261 --> 00:18:51,595
I'm so sorry, honey.
I guess he's not coming.

370
00:18:51,664 --> 00:18:53,931
That's all right.
Let's just--

371
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,334
There you are!
Sorry I'm late.

372
00:18:56,369 --> 00:18:59,237
Family thing ran over
way past its time.

373
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:01,105
- Hi.
- Hi.

374
00:19:01,174 --> 00:19:03,674
I'm glad you came.
Hello, I'm Adrian.

375
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:06,044
Hi, I'm Sarah Payne.
I'm just here to--

376
00:19:06,079 --> 00:19:07,345
Make sure I'm safe?

377
00:19:07,380 --> 00:19:09,247
Perfectly understandable.

378
00:19:09,315 --> 00:19:11,849
Did I really make
that bad a first impression?

379
00:19:11,884 --> 00:19:13,884
You're right,
he is funny.

380
00:19:13,920 --> 00:19:16,087
And definitely
easy on the eyes.

381
00:19:16,156 --> 00:19:17,422
- Sarah.
- Sorry.

382
00:19:17,490 --> 00:19:19,557
I forgot that was
my outside voice.

383
00:19:19,592 --> 00:19:21,926
[chuckling]

384
00:19:21,994 --> 00:19:24,662
So do you want to get
that coffee now?

385
00:19:24,697 --> 00:19:26,664
- And would you like to join us?
- Yeah, you should come.

386
00:19:26,699 --> 00:19:29,700
Oh, no, no, I'm...
I'm really tired.

387
00:19:29,735 --> 00:19:32,203
The jet lag
is catching up with me,

388
00:19:32,238 --> 00:19:33,704
so you guys go.

389
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:35,073
Okay, okay.

390
00:19:35,108 --> 00:19:37,875
Go have fun! Bye.

391
00:19:37,910 --> 00:19:39,910
Come on.
I know the perfect spot.

392
00:19:41,013 --> 00:19:42,380
By the way, I'm Adrian.

393
00:19:42,415 --> 00:19:44,549
Yeah, you already--

394
00:19:44,584 --> 00:19:47,985
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm Maggie.

395
00:19:48,020 --> 00:19:50,154
Just one cup, okay?

396
00:19:50,190 --> 00:19:52,156
Otherwise I'll be up all night,
and the jet lag.

397
00:19:52,192 --> 00:19:54,325
You have my word.
One cup only.

398
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,661
If they offer us refills,
we'll have them executed.

399
00:20:11,057 --> 00:20:12,122
Hello.

400
00:20:12,158 --> 00:20:14,392
Oh.

401
00:20:15,829 --> 00:20:17,228
Oh, Y-Your...

402
00:20:17,296 --> 00:20:19,230
Your...

403
00:20:19,298 --> 00:20:22,199
You're more than welcome
to sit anywhere you like.

405
00:20:35,982 --> 00:20:37,548
MAGGIE: I'm good at it,

406
00:20:37,584 --> 00:20:40,385
but lately I feel a little
trapped, like I'm...

407
00:20:40,420 --> 00:20:42,152
Following
someone else's plans.

408
00:20:42,188 --> 00:20:43,788
Like it was expected of me
to be a lawyer,

409
00:20:43,823 --> 00:20:46,223
so I never really gave
anything else a try.

410
00:20:46,292 --> 00:20:47,958
And then it dawned on me
at this interview

411
00:20:47,994 --> 00:20:49,894
that here I am
desperate for a job

412
00:20:49,962 --> 00:20:51,863
where I'll be spending
millions of hours

413
00:20:51,898 --> 00:20:54,399
just a cog in a machine.

414
00:20:54,467 --> 00:20:57,001
Maybe you should
trust your instincts.

415
00:20:57,036 --> 00:20:58,168
Don't do it.

416
00:20:58,204 --> 00:21:00,371
Not that simple.

417
00:21:00,407 --> 00:21:02,973
I mean, it's a good career move,
I want the security,

418
00:21:03,009 --> 00:21:05,142
I need the salary,

419
00:21:05,177 --> 00:21:07,512
and to be fair,
my parents did give up a lot

420
00:21:07,547 --> 00:21:09,514
for me to get to this point.

421
00:21:09,549 --> 00:21:12,983
Yes, never underestimate
the power of parental guilt.

422
00:21:13,019 --> 00:21:17,321
Yeah, but it is also me.

423
00:21:17,356 --> 00:21:20,725
I've been on this path too long.
I'm too scared to get off.

424
00:21:20,794 --> 00:21:22,226
I know the feeling.

425
00:21:22,295 --> 00:21:25,029
I've had my life
pretty much dictated for me

426
00:21:25,064 --> 00:21:27,031
since before I was born.

427
00:21:27,066 --> 00:21:29,233
Hmm, let me guess.

428
00:21:29,302 --> 00:21:33,237
They always wanted you
to be a doctor.

429
00:21:33,306 --> 00:21:34,972
Uh, no.

430
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:37,074
We have a family business.

431
00:21:37,143 --> 00:21:39,143
A very old family business.

432
00:21:39,178 --> 00:21:42,012
Lots of rules and regulations.

433
00:21:42,048 --> 00:21:43,080
Banking?

434
00:21:43,149 --> 00:21:46,717
No, mostly real estate,

435
00:21:46,753 --> 00:21:49,153
a bit of politics,
boring stuff.

436
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:54,459
My late father was really good
at running it.

437
00:21:54,494 --> 00:21:57,862
Now my mother and everyone else
expects me to take over,

438
00:21:57,897 --> 00:22:03,367
but sometimes it's the last
thing that I want to do.

439
00:22:03,402 --> 00:22:05,470
No siblings?

440
00:22:05,505 --> 00:22:08,038
You don't have a younger sister
you could pass the torch to?

441
00:22:08,074 --> 00:22:09,807
Sadly, no.

442
00:22:09,843 --> 00:22:12,076
When I was younger, I loved
being the only child. Now--

443
00:22:12,144 --> 00:22:13,978
Now you're like, "Please!
I wish there was someone else

444
00:22:14,013 --> 00:22:15,379
they could obsess over
for a while."

445
00:22:15,414 --> 00:22:17,915
Yes!

446
00:22:31,798 --> 00:22:33,898
So come on, out with it.

447
00:22:33,967 --> 00:22:35,800
Tell me your secret.

00:22:35,835 --> 00:22:36,968
Excuse me?

449
00:22:37,003 --> 00:22:39,069
I went for coffee with you.

450
00:22:40,473 --> 00:22:42,373
The trick with the watch.

451
00:22:42,408 --> 00:22:43,808
Oh!
[laughs]

452
00:22:43,843 --> 00:22:47,979
Well, you want to know
the real secret?

453
00:22:48,014 --> 00:22:49,647
Yes.

454
00:22:49,682 --> 00:22:54,719
The secret is that
you don't really want to know.

455
00:22:54,754 --> 00:22:57,889
Well, sir, that's very
presumptuous of you.

456
00:22:57,924 --> 00:23:00,658
You don't want to know 'cause
it would ruin the mystery.

457
00:23:00,693 --> 00:23:04,194
You enjoy the mystery
too much to ruin it.

458
00:23:04,230 --> 00:23:06,296
I can see it in your eyes.

459
00:23:06,332 --> 00:23:07,532
Can you?

460
00:23:07,567 --> 00:23:09,133
Yes.

461
00:23:11,838 --> 00:23:14,171
Uh, well, it's late.

462
00:23:14,206 --> 00:23:17,408
Thank you for the coffee
and the mystery.

463
00:23:17,476 --> 00:23:18,876
You're very welcome.

464
00:23:18,912 --> 00:23:21,345
You free any other days
while you're here?

465
00:23:21,380 --> 00:23:26,017
Uh, well, my friend Sarah
planned the trip.

466
00:23:26,052 --> 00:23:28,218
I'm kind of just along
for the ride.

467
00:23:28,254 --> 00:23:30,220
I'm not sure
what the schedule's like.

468
00:23:30,256 --> 00:23:33,323
Why don't I just
check in with you tomorrow?

469
00:23:33,359 --> 00:23:36,226
We can leave it to mystery.

470
00:23:36,295 --> 00:23:39,030
Okay. I'd like that.

471
00:23:41,801 --> 00:23:44,669
Good night.
I had a great time.

472
00:23:44,704 --> 00:23:45,736
Me too.

[laughs]

474
00:24:13,165 --> 00:24:14,799
I worry about you,

475
00:24:14,834 --> 00:24:17,301
riding that machine at night.

476
00:24:17,336 --> 00:24:18,669
Thank you, Mother,
but I'm fine.

477
00:24:18,705 --> 00:24:21,005
And a bit old for a curfew.

478
00:24:21,040 --> 00:24:22,673
When we were young,

479
00:24:22,709 --> 00:24:25,576
your father loved to go dancing
on Friday nights.

480
00:24:25,645 --> 00:24:27,211
Did he?

481
00:24:27,246 --> 00:24:29,747
Yes.

482
00:24:29,816 --> 00:24:33,985
But after his coronation,
he stopped.

483
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:35,720
Why?

484
00:24:35,755 --> 00:24:39,189
Because he realized
it was unseemly

485
00:24:39,225 --> 00:24:43,460
for a king to just be
one of the guys.

486
00:24:43,496 --> 00:24:48,032
The people expect us
to be different, separate.

487
00:24:48,067 --> 00:24:52,236
We're not just citizens.

488
00:24:53,740 --> 00:24:55,873
We're symbols of state.

489
00:24:57,877 --> 00:25:00,177
That is just sad.

490
00:25:00,212 --> 00:25:02,412
Profoundly sad.

491
00:25:03,549 --> 00:25:05,382
Good night, Mother.

492
00:25:23,803 --> 00:25:24,969

00:25:38,484 --> 00:25:41,185
I didn't order this.

You did not,
and yet here it is.

Oh, come in, please.

eat a good breakfast

and let Henrik, your concierge,
know if you're available

for an outing at 10 this morning
or any time thereabouts.

00:26:10,249 --> 00:26:12,183
P.S. Dress warmly

505
00:26:12,218 --> 00:26:15,086
and tell your friend Sarah
she's welcome to come along."

506
00:26:17,489 --> 00:26:19,023
Do you know Adrian?

507
00:26:19,058 --> 00:26:20,357
Since he was a boy.

508
00:26:20,392 --> 00:26:22,827
And his family.
Wonderful people.

509
00:26:22,862 --> 00:26:26,864
He said they were in business.
What do they do?

510
00:26:26,899 --> 00:26:28,132
I am sorry, mademoiselle.

511
00:26:28,167 --> 00:26:29,834
I have been
sworn to secrecy.

512
00:26:29,869 --> 00:26:31,401
Come on, out with it.

513
00:26:31,470 --> 00:26:34,138
I have also been threatened
with unemployment.

514
00:26:36,843 --> 00:26:38,876
Do they own the hotel?

515
00:26:38,911 --> 00:26:40,811
No.

516
00:26:40,847 --> 00:26:43,047
I'll be back with tea.

517
00:26:46,919 --> 00:26:48,252
Should we go?

518
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:49,553
You should go.

519
00:26:49,588 --> 00:26:50,888
You're not coming?

520
00:26:50,923 --> 00:26:53,357
Maggie, this is
breakfast for two,

521
00:26:53,392 --> 00:26:54,825
but it's an invitation for one.

522
00:26:54,861 --> 00:26:56,227
Yeah, but he wrote--

523
00:26:56,295 --> 00:26:59,063
Uh-uh! Just the facts,
please, counselor.

524
00:26:59,132 --> 00:27:02,366
One, and I quote,
you guys talked for hours.

525
00:27:02,401 --> 00:27:04,401
Two, you said you felt like
you've know each other

526
00:27:04,470 --> 00:27:06,570
- your whole lives.
- Okay, okay, I get it.

527
00:27:06,639 --> 00:27:09,006
You don't want me along,
trust me.

528
00:27:09,041 --> 00:27:12,810
Besides, I still owe you
a birthday gift from last year.

529
00:27:12,845 --> 00:27:14,344
I'm gonna pick that out
this morning.

530
00:27:14,380 --> 00:27:15,846
I'll meet you at
the art museum after lunch,

531
00:27:15,882 --> 00:27:17,748
and you can act surprised.

532
00:27:20,519 --> 00:27:22,519
I don't know.
I gotta think about it.

533
00:27:22,554 --> 00:27:24,688
What is there to think about?

534
00:27:24,723 --> 00:27:27,491
He sent bacon.

535
00:27:29,328 --> 00:27:30,227
True.

536
00:27:35,545 --> 00:27:37,512
MAGGIE: It's not that I don't
wanna practice law anymore.

537
00:27:37,547 --> 00:27:41,248
It's just that I want my work
to mean something.

538
00:27:41,317 --> 00:27:44,151
Wow. It's beautiful out here.

539
00:27:44,186 --> 00:27:46,220
Really beautiful.

540
00:27:47,990 --> 00:27:51,158
So if you weren't a lawyer,
what would you do?

541
00:27:51,193 --> 00:27:54,194
I don't know.
Probably teach.

542
00:27:54,230 --> 00:27:55,730
I love working with kids.

543
00:27:55,765 --> 00:27:57,532
Right, yes, the tutoring.

544
00:27:57,567 --> 00:27:59,233
Hey, you know,
I work with kids, too.

545
00:27:59,268 --> 00:28:00,367
Oh, yeah?

546
00:28:00,403 --> 00:28:01,803
Yeah, I coach volleyball.

547
00:28:01,838 --> 00:28:03,871
And the kids,
they're amazing.

548
00:28:03,907 --> 00:28:06,908
You show them something new,
and their faces light up.

549
00:28:06,976 --> 00:28:08,576
They realize they can
finally do something

550
00:28:08,645 --> 00:28:10,377
they never thought possible.

551
00:28:10,413 --> 00:28:13,815
Opening up the world
for someone, it's like...

552
00:28:14,884 --> 00:28:15,917
Magic.

553
00:28:15,985 --> 00:28:17,819
Yeah.

554
00:28:19,388 --> 00:28:21,722
[phone chiming]

555
00:28:21,758 --> 00:28:23,090
Sorry.

556
00:28:23,159 --> 00:28:26,226
- Uh, it's work, um--
- Of course.

557
00:28:26,262 --> 00:28:27,929
What is it?

558
00:28:27,997 --> 00:28:29,931
<i>FELIX: Apologies,</i>
<i>Your Highness.</i>

559
00:28:29,999 --> 00:28:31,999
<i>The Royal Trust Judiciary</i>
<i>meeting?</i>

560
00:28:32,034 --> 00:28:33,601
No, isn't that in...

561
00:28:33,670 --> 00:28:35,837
Uh, no, I lost track of time.

562
00:28:35,872 --> 00:28:38,138
<i>The Judicial Secretary's here.</i>

563
00:28:38,174 --> 00:28:40,508
<i>Your mother's insisting</i>
<i>you sign the transfer documents</i>

564
00:28:40,543 --> 00:28:42,510
as it's so close
to the coronation.

565
00:28:42,545 --> 00:28:45,212
She's ready to tear the kingdom
apart looking for you

566
00:28:45,247 --> 00:28:47,882
- and blaming me.
<i>- Okay.</i>

567
00:28:47,917 --> 00:28:51,251
Tell them I'm on my way and
I'll be there as soon as I can.

568
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:53,387
Is everything all right?

569
00:28:53,422 --> 00:28:56,223
Yeah, I forgot about a meeting.
Lost track of time.

570
00:28:56,258 --> 00:28:58,058
Easy to do out here.

571
00:28:58,094 --> 00:28:59,226
Yes, it is.

572
00:29:01,531 --> 00:29:03,498
Well, we should get you
to your meeting then.

573
00:29:03,533 --> 00:29:06,266
I mean,
I'd much rather not, but...

574
00:29:06,335 --> 00:29:08,703
I get it.
The real world calls.

575
00:29:18,548 --> 00:29:20,982
SARAH: Lost track of time
is good.

576
00:29:21,017 --> 00:29:24,485
And he's taking me on a ride
around the countryside tomorrow.

577
00:29:24,521 --> 00:29:25,686
Nice!

578
00:29:28,257 --> 00:29:29,524
Wow.

579
00:29:39,769 --> 00:29:40,835
Excuse me?

580
00:29:40,870 --> 00:29:41,869
ATTENDANT: Yes, please.

581
00:29:41,905 --> 00:29:43,303
Who are these people?

582
00:29:43,339 --> 00:29:44,672
Well, like the plaque says,

583
00:29:44,707 --> 00:29:46,807
that is the royal family
of Calpurnia.

584
00:29:46,843 --> 00:29:49,577
That is our late King Albert,
may he rest in peace,

585
00:29:49,646 --> 00:29:51,378
and that is his wife
Queen Beatrice.

586
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:53,714
She is our current monarch.

587
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,149
And that one?

588
00:29:55,184 --> 00:29:58,052
That one is their son
Prince Adrian.

589
00:29:58,087 --> 00:30:02,089
In just a few days, he will be
crowned as our next king.

590
00:30:02,158 --> 00:30:04,425
Uh, Maggie?

591
00:30:04,493 --> 00:30:05,492
Yeah.

592
00:30:05,528 --> 00:30:07,261
You may wanna get over here.

593
00:30:13,870 --> 00:30:18,138
That is the Prince of Calpurnia.

594
00:30:18,174 --> 00:30:20,041
Yeah, so?

595
00:30:21,343 --> 00:30:22,342
Wait, that...

596
00:30:25,247 --> 00:30:27,347
That's Adrian.

597
00:30:34,156 --> 00:30:37,892
There he is,
Prince Adrian of Calpurnia.

598
00:30:37,927 --> 00:30:40,027
That's crazy.

599
00:30:44,433 --> 00:30:46,934
- Uh-oh.
- What?

600
00:30:47,003 --> 00:30:48,903
"Europe's most eligible
bachelor,

601
00:30:48,972 --> 00:30:51,305
the Playboy Prince."

602
00:30:53,375 --> 00:30:55,476
Oh, no.

603
00:30:58,414 --> 00:31:02,416
[motor idling]

604
00:31:02,485 --> 00:31:03,651
[motor turns off]

605
00:31:11,527 --> 00:31:13,494
Hey, ready to go?

606
00:31:13,529 --> 00:31:15,763
As you wish, Your Highness.

607
00:31:15,832 --> 00:31:17,932
Cool, let's...

608
00:31:18,001 --> 00:31:19,533
Your Highness?

609
00:31:19,568 --> 00:31:20,768
You know?

610
00:31:20,837 --> 00:31:23,738
Sarah and I went to the museum.

611
00:31:23,806 --> 00:31:24,872
Portrait gallery.

612
00:31:24,907 --> 00:31:26,874
- Yeah.
- Right.

613
00:31:26,909 --> 00:31:28,308
Uh...

614
00:31:28,344 --> 00:31:30,310
Hey, it's the prince!

615
00:31:30,346 --> 00:31:31,912
Oh, my God!

616
00:31:31,981 --> 00:31:35,082
[excited chatter]

617
00:31:38,021 --> 00:31:40,021
Your Royal Highness,
a pleasure as always.

618
00:31:40,056 --> 00:31:41,856
The pleasure is all mine.

619
00:31:41,891 --> 00:31:45,392
I was wondering, is the atrium
closed for the winter season?

620
00:31:45,427 --> 00:31:47,762
Yes, sir.
Please follow me around back.

621
00:31:50,566 --> 00:31:52,499
- [woman squeals]
- [laughter]

622
00:31:52,535 --> 00:31:54,535
ADRIAN: I'm really sorry.
I should have told you.

623
00:31:54,570 --> 00:31:57,371
MAGGIE: Yes, you should have,
Your Worshipfulness.

624
00:31:57,406 --> 00:31:59,373
Forms of royal address

625
00:31:59,408 --> 00:32:01,676
obviously not covered
in American law schools.

626
00:32:01,711 --> 00:32:03,978
I gotta say,
I feel a little foolish.

627
00:32:04,013 --> 00:32:08,649
Maggie, we were
getting along so well.

628
00:32:08,685 --> 00:32:11,085
I didn't want to
ruin anything with--

629
00:32:11,154 --> 00:32:12,153
With the truth.

630
00:32:12,188 --> 00:32:16,490
No, no, just...

631
00:32:18,494 --> 00:32:23,898
You seemed to enjoy my company
for who I am,

632
00:32:23,933 --> 00:32:26,033
not because of my title
or the money

633
00:32:26,069 --> 00:32:27,568
or what they write about me.

634
00:32:27,603 --> 00:32:29,036
Wait, some girls wanna
go out with you

635
00:32:29,072 --> 00:32:30,805
because of what they write?

636
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,041
You'd be amazed to what attracts
some people to celebrity.

637
00:32:34,077 --> 00:32:37,178
I come from a completely
different world.

638
00:32:37,213 --> 00:32:38,913
Yes, yes, exactly.

639
00:32:38,981 --> 00:32:40,581
And that is what is
so great about you.

640
00:32:40,649 --> 00:32:42,516
One of the many things,
I might add.

641
00:32:42,551 --> 00:32:44,651
Do you say that
to all the other girls?

642
00:32:44,687 --> 00:32:49,356
Come on. The tabloid stuff,
it isn't true.

643
00:32:49,391 --> 00:32:52,860
- No, I'm just sorry that--
- That you got caught.

644
00:32:52,895 --> 00:32:57,098
No, no, just...

645
00:32:57,166 --> 00:33:01,668
that we were getting to know
each other as real people.

646
00:33:01,704 --> 00:33:04,371
The real me
and the real you.

647
00:33:04,406 --> 00:33:05,806
That's the thing, Adrian.

648
00:33:05,842 --> 00:33:07,742
For me to get to know
the real you,

649
00:33:07,810 --> 00:33:09,643
that means all of you,
not just the part of you

650
00:33:09,678 --> 00:33:12,346
that you want me to see.

651
00:33:12,381 --> 00:33:14,815
Okay, fair enough.

652
00:33:18,587 --> 00:33:21,088
I'd like to show you
the real me,

653
00:33:21,157 --> 00:33:23,023
but in a different way.

654
00:33:23,059 --> 00:33:24,258
What do you mean?

655
00:33:24,326 --> 00:33:27,161
But not here.

656
00:33:27,196 --> 00:33:30,264
Okay, the thing is, I'm actually
really terrified of motorcycles.

657
00:33:30,332 --> 00:33:34,034
Oh, no, no, it's fine.
We can walk there.

658
00:33:34,070 --> 00:33:35,770
It's only a couple
of blocks away.

659
00:33:35,838 --> 00:33:40,540
And you can escape back to
your hotel anytime you want.

660
00:33:40,576 --> 00:33:41,809
Please.

661
00:33:44,647 --> 00:33:46,914
- Okay.
- Okay.

662
00:33:55,491 --> 00:33:59,526
Uh, okay, come on.
There's another way in.

663
00:34:03,699 --> 00:34:05,432
You see,
avoiding paparazzi is like

664
00:34:05,501 --> 00:34:07,534
the royal sport
of the Calpurnian crown.

665
00:34:07,569 --> 00:34:10,204
Let me guess.
You're the reigning champion.

666
00:34:10,239 --> 00:34:12,206
Smart and beautiful.

667
00:34:12,241 --> 00:34:13,908
I like that.

668
00:34:23,752 --> 00:34:25,986
Okay, now this,

669
00:34:26,022 --> 00:34:28,555
this is what
I wanted to show you.

670
00:34:28,590 --> 00:34:30,925
This is the real me.

671
00:34:30,993 --> 00:34:34,228
This is where
I feel most at home.

672
00:34:34,263 --> 00:34:36,697
Ooh! How lucky.

673
00:34:36,732 --> 00:34:37,731
[blows whistle]

674
00:34:37,766 --> 00:34:38,866
Okay, just carry on.

675
00:34:38,901 --> 00:34:41,368
Felix, this is my friend Maggie.

676
00:34:41,403 --> 00:34:44,071
Maggie, this is Felix,
my valet.

677
00:34:44,140 --> 00:34:45,906
He also helps out here,

678
00:34:45,975 --> 00:34:48,142
out of the goodness
of his true Calpurnian heart.

679
00:34:49,678 --> 00:34:50,878
A pleasure.

680
00:34:50,913 --> 00:34:52,246
The pleasure's all mine.

681
00:34:52,315 --> 00:34:54,181
Felix, do you mind
telling Maggie

682
00:34:54,217 --> 00:34:56,851
a little bit about
what we do here?

683
00:34:56,886 --> 00:35:00,354
Uh, sure,
what exactly should I--

684
00:35:00,389 --> 00:35:03,257
Tell her the whole truth
and nothing but.

685
00:35:03,326 --> 00:35:05,559
BOY: Come on, Adrian,
we need you!

686
00:35:05,594 --> 00:35:08,162
Right, okay, my lady,
you'll have to excuse me.

687
00:35:08,197 --> 00:35:10,264
My presence is requested.

688
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:11,832
[blows whistle]

689
00:35:11,868 --> 00:35:14,335
Okay, guys,
let's practice serves.

690
00:35:14,370 --> 00:35:16,370
Everyone line up
on the other side.

691
00:35:18,912 --> 00:35:22,314
You must be a really good friend
for him to bring you here.

692
00:35:22,349 --> 00:35:24,882
Does he bring
other friends here?

693
00:35:24,918 --> 00:35:27,685
He's never
brought anyone here.

694
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:30,255
You are the first.

695
00:35:30,324 --> 00:35:33,925
His own mother doesn't know
anything about this.

696
00:35:33,994 --> 00:35:35,593
You're kidding.

697
00:35:35,662 --> 00:35:37,829
Nope.

698
00:35:37,864 --> 00:35:41,199
The work we do here
is his true passion,

699
00:35:41,234 --> 00:35:44,602
and he is
very protective of it.

700
00:35:44,671 --> 00:35:49,707
See, when he was a boy,
Adrian was shocked to learn

701
00:35:49,742 --> 00:35:51,476
that there are people
in Calpurnia

702
00:35:51,511 --> 00:35:53,044
less fortunate than he,

703
00:35:53,080 --> 00:35:54,679
so when he turned 18,

704
00:35:54,714 --> 00:35:57,815
he received a large sum of money
from the royal trust,

705
00:35:57,851 --> 00:36:00,885
and he spent most of it
setting up this foundation

706
00:36:00,920 --> 00:36:02,988
for children
from low-income families.

707
00:36:03,023 --> 00:36:04,856
Wow.

708
00:36:04,891 --> 00:36:06,824
FELIX: It's funny.

709
00:36:06,860 --> 00:36:11,029
The tabloids call him
the "Playboy Prince."

710
00:36:11,064 --> 00:36:14,199
What kind of playboy spends
most of his money on this?

711
00:36:14,234 --> 00:36:16,167
[blows whistle]
All right, guys, good stuff.

712
00:36:16,203 --> 00:36:18,103
Right, let's run some drills.

713
00:36:18,171 --> 00:36:19,871
Uh, Felix.

714
00:36:21,108 --> 00:36:23,108
Excuse me. Duty calls.

715
00:36:24,378 --> 00:36:25,510
Thank you.

716
00:36:28,382 --> 00:36:32,583
So what kind of lies
did Felix tell you about me?

717
00:36:32,652 --> 00:36:35,820
Only the truth
and nothing but.

718
00:36:35,855 --> 00:36:38,423
So this is the real you, huh?

719
00:36:38,492 --> 00:36:41,826
Well, it's the part of me
I like best.

720
00:36:41,861 --> 00:36:43,895
I like it, too.

721
00:36:47,334 --> 00:36:49,367
Can I ask you a question?

722
00:36:49,403 --> 00:36:50,935
Of course.

723
00:36:51,004 --> 00:36:54,039
Why keep this a secret?
The press gets one whiff of this

724
00:36:54,074 --> 00:36:56,974
and your whole
public image changes.

725
00:36:57,010 --> 00:36:59,477
I don't trust them.

726
00:36:59,513 --> 00:37:01,979
"Playboy Prince" sells papers.

727
00:37:02,015 --> 00:37:04,649
"Good-Boy Prince" doesn't.

728
00:37:04,684 --> 00:37:07,352
WOMAN: All right, children,
everyone up on the stage.

729
00:37:07,387 --> 00:37:09,354
What's going on over there?

730
00:37:09,389 --> 00:37:11,156
Oh, choir practice.

731
00:37:11,191 --> 00:37:14,092
Yeah, some of the kids
aren't as into sports, so we--

732
00:37:14,161 --> 00:37:16,261
- BOY: Adrian!
- I'll tell you what.

733
00:37:16,329 --> 00:37:18,029
Can you just give me
two seconds? I just--

734
00:37:18,065 --> 00:37:19,097
Yeah.

Oh.

745
00:37:52,699 --> 00:37:57,368
I used to be scared about
talking in front of people, too.

746
00:37:57,404 --> 00:37:59,704
And my daddy was a big lawyer,
and he had to talk

in front of a lot of people
all the time.

I told you, it's a secret.
Don't you like mystery?

769
00:39:04,538 --> 00:39:08,273
All right, that's fair,
but be warned.

770
00:39:08,341 --> 00:39:10,875
I am going to make it
my life's mission to find out.

771
00:39:10,910 --> 00:39:13,044
- Your life's mission, huh?
- Mm-hmm.

772
00:39:13,079 --> 00:39:16,681
I guess that means we'll be
seeing each other again.

773
00:39:16,716 --> 00:39:18,383
Only if you want to.

774
00:39:18,418 --> 00:39:20,751
I guess I do.
It's just...

775
00:39:20,820 --> 00:39:24,389
I'm only here for a short while,
and you seem pretty busy.

776
00:39:24,424 --> 00:39:27,258
I'll make time for you.

777
00:39:27,327 --> 00:39:28,893
That's sweet,

778
00:39:28,928 --> 00:39:32,029
but don't you have a coronation
to get ready for?

779
00:39:32,065 --> 00:39:34,699
Yes, my lady, but we have
people for that sort of thing.

780
00:39:34,734 --> 00:39:36,367
I'll tell you what.

781
00:39:36,403 --> 00:39:38,736
Why don't you drop by the palace
for dinner tonight?

782
00:39:38,771 --> 00:39:40,871
You said you wanted
to meet all of me.

783
00:39:40,907 --> 00:39:44,375
This would be your chance
to see the other side.

784
00:39:44,411 --> 00:39:47,645
Wow. I--
I mean thank you.

785
00:39:47,681 --> 00:39:50,848
But is the palace
someplace you just drop by?

786
00:39:50,883 --> 00:39:53,218
It is if you're
with the prince.

787
00:39:53,253 --> 00:39:54,885
- [chuckles]
- All right.

788
00:39:54,921 --> 00:39:57,689
How about I send a car
to pick you up at your hotel,

789
00:39:57,724 --> 00:39:59,824
and we get you
on the guest list?

790
00:39:59,859 --> 00:40:02,827
All proper like.

791
00:40:02,862 --> 00:40:06,030
Maggie, trust me,
it'll be fun.

792
00:40:08,067 --> 00:40:09,767
Okay.

793
00:40:09,836 --> 00:40:10,835
Great.

794
00:40:15,408 --> 00:40:18,042
SARAH: I can't believe
that you're dating a king.

795
00:40:18,077 --> 00:40:20,478
He's not king yet,
and we're not dating.

796
00:40:20,513 --> 00:40:23,047
We're just enjoying
each other's company.

797
00:40:23,082 --> 00:40:27,218
I think that's the actual
definition of dating.

798
00:40:27,254 --> 00:40:28,319
I don't know.

799
00:40:28,355 --> 00:40:29,654
This one?

800
00:40:29,689 --> 00:40:31,322
Is this fancy enough?

801
00:40:33,192 --> 00:40:35,025
I guess.

802
00:40:35,061 --> 00:40:37,895
Maybe next time you should
consider your wardrobe

803
00:40:37,930 --> 00:40:40,030
before accepting
a palatial invitation.

804
00:40:40,066 --> 00:40:41,532
[knocking]

805
00:40:49,576 --> 00:40:52,076
- Hello.
- The Prince realized

806
00:40:52,111 --> 00:40:54,545
you might need some assistance
for this evening.

807
00:40:57,584 --> 00:40:59,651
Oh, my...

808
00:41:05,725 --> 00:41:07,191
Wow!

809
00:41:07,226 --> 00:41:11,562
Dating a prince
definitely has its perks.

810
00:41:11,598 --> 00:41:12,597
Ah!

811
00:41:15,402 --> 00:41:17,335
Adrian's bringing a guest?

812
00:41:17,370 --> 00:41:19,337
Why wasn't I informed
of this before?

813
00:41:19,372 --> 00:41:22,106
I am sorry, Your Majesty.
It's a last-minute addition.

814
00:41:22,175 --> 00:41:24,442
I've only just
found out myself.

815
00:41:24,511 --> 00:41:26,311
Would you like me
to talk to the prince?

816
00:41:26,346 --> 00:41:29,213
No. Let's meet this person.

817
00:41:29,248 --> 00:41:32,016
But as with any palace visitor,

818
00:41:32,051 --> 00:41:36,187
I assume you'll run
a full background check.

819
00:41:36,222 --> 00:41:38,323
Absolutely.

820
00:41:38,358 --> 00:41:39,590
Right away.

821
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:01,746
Wow.

822
00:42:15,061 --> 00:42:17,662
Miss.

823
00:42:17,697 --> 00:42:19,196
Thank you.

824
00:42:42,088 --> 00:42:43,521
Miss.

825
00:42:46,860 --> 00:42:48,393
Thank you.

826
00:42:50,997 --> 00:42:53,598
I knew you'd pick that dress.

827
00:42:53,666 --> 00:42:56,000
You did?
I wish you would have told me.

828
00:42:56,035 --> 00:42:59,504
It took me an hour
to make up my mind.

829
00:43:04,176 --> 00:43:05,576
You look beautiful.

830
00:43:05,612 --> 00:43:08,513
I'm really glad you came.

831
00:43:08,548 --> 00:43:11,382
You dress up pretty nice
yourself, Your Highness.

832
00:43:11,418 --> 00:43:14,419
I guess that's not a joke.
That's your real title.

833
00:43:14,487 --> 00:43:16,353
I'm chattering on.
I'm sorry.

834
00:43:16,389 --> 00:43:19,891
The only other time I've been
to a castle was at Disneyland.

835
00:43:19,926 --> 00:43:22,427
Well, we're not much
for amusement rides here,

836
00:43:22,495 --> 00:43:24,929
although dinner with my mother
can be a roller coaster.

837
00:43:24,997 --> 00:43:27,064
- Good evening.
- Mother!

838
00:43:27,099 --> 00:43:30,100
May I introduce Maggie Marks,

839
00:43:30,169 --> 00:43:32,870
an American visiting
our fair land from New York.

840
00:43:32,906 --> 00:43:36,507
Maggie, this is my mother
Queen Beatrice of Calpurnia.

841
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:42,012
How do you do?

842
00:43:42,048 --> 00:43:43,881
Fine, thank you.

843
00:43:43,917 --> 00:43:45,883
Welcome to our home,
Miss Marks.

844
00:43:45,919 --> 00:43:48,052
I'm delighted
that you could join us.

845
00:43:48,087 --> 00:43:50,655
Since my forgetful son
has kept everything about you

846
00:43:50,690 --> 00:43:52,490
a mystery up till now,

847
00:43:52,525 --> 00:43:55,192
I'm eager
to make your acquaintance.

848
00:43:55,227 --> 00:43:57,394
He does love his mystery,
doesn't he?

849
00:43:57,430 --> 00:43:58,896
Indeed.

850
00:43:58,932 --> 00:44:01,499
Well, I'm famished.
Shall we?

851
00:44:12,626 --> 00:44:14,927
New York's lovely at this time,
but not like here.

852
00:44:14,962 --> 00:44:17,663
To us tourists,
you live in a fairy tale.

853
00:44:17,731 --> 00:44:20,465
CAMILLA: So how exactly
do you know the prince?

854
00:44:20,501 --> 00:44:22,467
The street.

855
00:44:25,139 --> 00:44:28,240
I mean, we met on the street.

856
00:44:28,276 --> 00:44:30,142
I ran over her hat.

857
00:44:30,178 --> 00:44:34,947
Oh, how adorably
uncivilized of you.

858
00:44:34,982 --> 00:44:38,583
Perhaps it's time
to give our American guest

859
00:44:38,619 --> 00:44:40,419
a chance to eat.

860
00:44:42,323 --> 00:44:44,924
Your Highness, I hear
the final arrangements

861
00:44:44,959 --> 00:44:48,160
for the coronation
are moving along smoothly.

862
00:44:48,229 --> 00:44:52,264
Yes, my mother and staff
have me on quite a tight leash.

863
00:44:52,300 --> 00:44:55,000
Speaking of which,
I'd love your opinion.

864
00:44:55,069 --> 00:44:57,002
As an expert
in government affairs,

865
00:44:57,071 --> 00:44:58,770
- Adrian.
- do you see any reason

866
00:44:58,806 --> 00:45:01,073
why we shouldn't open
the coronation to the public?

867
00:45:01,108 --> 00:45:02,942
Ah, the age-old question

868
00:45:02,977 --> 00:45:06,078
of modern populism
versus aristocratic tradition.

869
00:45:06,113 --> 00:45:08,580
I believe your father,

870
00:45:08,615 --> 00:45:10,582
may he rest in peace,

871
00:45:10,617 --> 00:45:12,985
said that there is
an inverse correlation

872
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:15,087
between how long
a monarch has ruled

873
00:45:15,122 --> 00:45:18,357
and their desire to be seen
as one with the people.

874
00:45:18,425 --> 00:45:19,825
It takes awhile
for young rulers to realize

875
00:45:19,861 --> 00:45:22,294
that their job is
not to be popular,

876
00:45:22,330 --> 00:45:24,463
but to govern.

877
00:45:24,498 --> 00:45:26,999
It's not about being popular.

878
00:45:27,068 --> 00:45:29,501
It's about allowing our citizens
to be part of a ceremony

879
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:32,338
that will very much
affect their lives.

880
00:45:32,406 --> 00:45:34,173
Well, personally, I
appreciate that the coronation

881
00:45:34,242 --> 00:45:35,774
is one of the few
traditions we have kept

882
00:45:35,809 --> 00:45:39,078
according to its original
centuries-old design.

883
00:45:39,113 --> 00:45:42,414
People love the aristocracy
because our traditions

884
00:45:42,449 --> 00:45:45,985
give everyone a window
into a more civilized past,

885
00:45:46,020 --> 00:45:50,422
as far back as the Renaissance,
even the Middle Ages.

886
00:45:50,457 --> 00:45:52,758
I hardly think the Middle Ages
were civilized.

887
00:45:52,793 --> 00:45:54,826
And the Renaissance
wasn't great either.

888
00:45:54,896 --> 00:45:58,730
I mean, didn't the Inquisition
happen during the Renaissance?

889
00:45:58,766 --> 00:46:01,233
Well, certainly not here.

890
00:46:01,269 --> 00:46:03,635
No, I wasn't implying that.

891
00:46:03,670 --> 00:46:07,306
And what would be the American
perspective on the issue?

892
00:46:07,341 --> 00:46:11,076
Oh, I wouldn't want to meddle--
I mean intrude.

893
00:46:11,112 --> 00:46:12,577
No, not at all.

894
00:46:12,613 --> 00:46:15,647
We'd be very grateful
for your opinions

895
00:46:15,682 --> 00:46:17,582
as an outsider.

896
00:46:22,290 --> 00:46:25,324
Well, of course, I don't know
as much as all of you

897
00:46:25,359 --> 00:46:27,192
about the issue,

898
00:46:27,261 --> 00:46:29,494
but I agree with Adrian.

899
00:46:29,563 --> 00:46:31,397
I don't see anything wrong
in inviting the people

900
00:46:31,432 --> 00:46:32,664
to the coronation.

901
00:46:32,733 --> 00:46:33,899
Wouldn't it give the press

902
00:46:33,935 --> 00:46:35,334
something positive
to write about?

903
00:46:35,403 --> 00:46:37,169
That's exactly
what I was saying.

904
00:46:37,238 --> 00:46:40,005
I read a survey recently that
said the whole idea of royalty

905
00:46:40,074 --> 00:46:41,407
is becoming quite obsolete

906
00:46:41,442 --> 00:46:44,176
and not just in
third-world countries.

907
00:46:47,248 --> 00:46:49,915
So maybe connecting
with the everyday people

908
00:46:49,951 --> 00:46:53,518
would make the monarchy
more relevant?

909
00:46:55,289 --> 00:46:59,624
Well, I for one,
do not feel obsolete.

910
00:46:59,660 --> 00:47:01,260
No, I didn't mean that.

911
00:47:01,295 --> 00:47:04,563
And Calpurnia is far from
a third-world country.

912
00:47:09,770 --> 00:47:12,771
Dory, I think
time for more wine.

913
00:47:12,806 --> 00:47:13,905
Yes, please.

914
00:47:23,650 --> 00:47:25,451
I'm so sorry.

915
00:47:25,486 --> 00:47:27,652
Oh, no, if anyone should
apologize, it's me.

916
00:47:27,688 --> 00:47:29,288
I just threw you
into the lion's den.

917
00:47:29,323 --> 00:47:31,256
I had no idea
it would get that tense.

918
00:47:31,292 --> 00:47:33,658
Adrian.

919
00:47:33,694 --> 00:47:35,494
I need to speak to you.

920
00:47:35,562 --> 00:47:38,563
Felix will see Miss Marks
back to her hotel.

921
00:47:38,599 --> 00:47:40,065
- I'd rather take her.
- No, no.

922
00:47:40,101 --> 00:47:42,101
No problem at all.
Felix can drive me.

923
00:47:42,136 --> 00:47:44,669
Please. And again,
thank you so much

924
00:47:44,738 --> 00:47:47,072
for your wonderful hospitality.

925
00:47:47,108 --> 00:47:51,343
Dinner was delicious,
and you have a beautiful home.

926
00:47:51,412 --> 00:47:53,479
I'll give your compliments
to the chef.

927
00:47:53,514 --> 00:47:55,914
- Good night.
- Good night.

928
00:47:55,949 --> 00:47:58,117
I'll call you
in a bit, okay?

929
00:47:58,152 --> 00:47:59,784
Sure.

930
00:48:08,496 --> 00:48:10,896
Adrian, you hardly know
that girl.

931
00:48:10,931 --> 00:48:12,664
Why did you bring her here?

932
00:48:12,733 --> 00:48:15,800
Because I really like her,
and I'm getting to know her.

933
00:48:15,836 --> 00:48:17,602
You are the future king.

934
00:48:17,638 --> 00:48:19,938
Do you not understand
the implications?

935
00:48:19,973 --> 00:48:23,108
You can't just
date anyone you wish.

936
00:48:23,144 --> 00:48:24,243
No.

937
00:48:24,278 --> 00:48:26,445
That's the thing,
you see.

938
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:27,513
I can.

939
00:48:30,017 --> 00:48:32,017
I will.

940
00:48:32,086 --> 00:48:34,186
The rest of you
just have to deal with it.

941
00:48:59,513 --> 00:49:00,512
[splat]

942
00:49:04,851 --> 00:49:05,850
[splat]

943
00:49:08,456 --> 00:49:09,921
[splat]

944
00:49:30,677 --> 00:49:32,277
Want to go for a walk?

945
00:49:35,516 --> 00:49:36,648
Are you sure?

946
00:49:36,683 --> 00:49:38,417
Of course I'm sure.

947
00:49:38,452 --> 00:49:42,087
I'm sort of a lot of trouble
for you.

948
00:49:42,123 --> 00:49:43,688
Maybe I like trouble.

949
00:49:46,360 --> 00:49:47,959
Give me a minute.

950
00:49:51,965 --> 00:49:55,400
[distant chatter]

951
00:49:58,506 --> 00:50:01,006
Sorry for all the sneaking
around on the back streets.

952
00:50:01,074 --> 00:50:02,741
- It's just--
- I get it.

953
00:50:02,776 --> 00:50:05,577
You're not just some guy.

954
00:50:05,613 --> 00:50:08,413
As much as I want to be.

955
00:50:08,449 --> 00:50:11,283
Maybe you shouldn't try so hard
to be someone else.

956
00:50:11,318 --> 00:50:13,352
Find your own way of being king.

957
00:50:13,420 --> 00:50:16,288
Easier said than done.
I don't know.

958
00:50:16,323 --> 00:50:19,858
Maybe I'm just not ready.

959
00:50:19,926 --> 00:50:22,461
I wish you could see yourself
the way I see you.

960
00:50:22,496 --> 00:50:25,230
The way you are
with those kids at the church.

961
00:50:25,266 --> 00:50:28,467
You're kind, you're caring,
you're funny.

962
00:50:29,836 --> 00:50:32,003
Funny looking.
[chuckles]

963
00:50:32,072 --> 00:50:35,607
You'll make a wonderful king.

964
00:50:35,643 --> 00:50:38,076
Well, you are very kind.

965
00:50:38,111 --> 00:50:41,146
But that's not
what makes a good ruler.

966
00:50:41,182 --> 00:50:43,782
Who defines that,
your mother?

967
00:50:45,486 --> 00:50:48,019
My dad was so good at it.

968
00:50:48,088 --> 00:50:51,323
Like at dinner. He would have
run circles around those nobles

969
00:50:51,358 --> 00:50:53,625
and their pretentious nonsense.

970
00:50:53,661 --> 00:50:55,360
He would have had them
and my mother agreeing

971
00:50:55,429 --> 00:50:58,096
to whatever he wanted
before the second course

972
00:50:58,131 --> 00:51:01,400
and then thinking it was
their idea in the first place.

973
00:51:01,435 --> 00:51:04,903
So he's a master manipulator.

974
00:51:04,938 --> 00:51:07,239
Pretty much.

975
00:51:07,274 --> 00:51:09,608
I don't know how to do that.

976
00:51:09,643 --> 00:51:11,176
Who says you have to?

977
00:51:11,245 --> 00:51:14,179
You're more of a doer
than a talker anyway.

978
00:51:14,248 --> 00:51:17,148
Oh, well,
don't sell my dad short.

979
00:51:17,184 --> 00:51:18,350
He was a great guy.

980
00:51:18,419 --> 00:51:20,619
No, I didn't mean that.

981
00:51:22,956 --> 00:51:24,423
You miss him.

982
00:51:28,195 --> 00:51:29,428
When I was little,

983
00:51:29,463 --> 00:51:31,496
he used to make up
stories for me

984
00:51:31,565 --> 00:51:33,064
with whatever was around.

985
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:36,468
Like if he was here,

986
00:51:36,503 --> 00:51:39,971
he'd say these lights
are mystical flowers

987
00:51:40,006 --> 00:51:42,741
that bloom only at night,

988
00:51:42,776 --> 00:51:44,309
and they grant wishes
to whoever knows

989
00:51:44,345 --> 00:51:46,411
how to unlock their secrets.

990
00:51:47,481 --> 00:51:48,680
Who says they aren't?

991
00:51:48,749 --> 00:51:51,416
See, the lights are magic.

992
00:51:51,452 --> 00:51:53,285
They turn your hair to gold.

993
00:51:55,256 --> 00:51:58,156
You've a beautiful way
of seeing things.

994
00:51:58,191 --> 00:51:59,924
And you're just beautiful.

995
00:51:59,960 --> 00:52:03,094
Thank you, Your Highness.

996
00:52:14,775 --> 00:52:16,675
I've never kissed
a prince before.

997
00:52:18,479 --> 00:52:20,779
How was it?

998
00:52:20,814 --> 00:52:22,347
Awesome.

999
00:52:24,752 --> 00:52:25,651
[camera clicks]

1000
00:52:32,593 --> 00:52:33,492

1001
00:52:36,630 --> 00:52:37,529
[click]

1002
00:52:46,584 --> 00:52:47,982
Thank you.

1003
00:52:59,930 --> 00:53:01,830
MAGGIE: Oh, I slept in,

1004
00:53:01,865 --> 00:53:04,366
and I still can't believe
how tired I am.

1005
00:53:04,435 --> 00:53:06,835
That's what happens when you
stay out most of the night.

1006
00:53:06,870 --> 00:53:08,103
You're just jealous.

1007
00:53:08,138 --> 00:53:09,404
PHOTOGRAPHER:
Hey, there she is!

1008
00:53:12,343 --> 00:53:13,642
What's happening?

1009
00:53:15,613 --> 00:53:17,312
Out, out!

1010
00:53:17,348 --> 00:53:19,948
Please go back to your room.

1011
00:53:19,983 --> 00:53:21,116
Quickly!

1012
00:53:21,151 --> 00:53:22,851
You must leave immediately! Out!

1013
00:53:22,919 --> 00:53:24,953
This is private property!

1014
00:53:30,661 --> 00:53:33,695
Have you seen the papers?

1015
00:53:33,764 --> 00:53:36,698
Do you ever think about the
consequences of your actions?

1016
00:53:36,767 --> 00:53:40,201
I messed up again,
and I apologize.

1017
00:53:40,271 --> 00:53:41,370
Where are you going?

1018
00:53:41,438 --> 00:53:42,704
To see if Maggie's okay.

1019
00:53:42,773 --> 00:53:44,339
To see if Maggie's okay?

1020
00:53:44,408 --> 00:53:45,774
What about us?

1021
00:53:45,809 --> 00:53:47,476
It's your coronation
in a few days.

1022
00:53:47,511 --> 00:53:48,943
We have to mitigate the damage.

1023
00:53:48,979 --> 00:53:51,012
You have an entire staff
to mitigate the damage.

1024
00:53:51,081 --> 00:53:54,449
- You don't need me here.
- It's not me you're avoiding.

1025
00:53:54,485 --> 00:53:57,252
It's yourself.
Your responsibility.

1026
00:53:57,288 --> 00:53:59,755
Sometimes I'm glad your father's
not here to see this.

1027
00:53:59,790 --> 00:54:01,923
Do you know what, Mother?

1028
00:54:01,958 --> 00:54:04,459
The truth is you don't want me
to take the crown.

1029
00:54:04,495 --> 00:54:06,595
You want Dad back,
and that's not happening.

1030
00:54:06,630 --> 00:54:08,630
- How dare you!
- No, I'm not a puppet,

1031
00:54:08,666 --> 00:54:10,465
and I never will be.

1032
00:54:10,501 --> 00:54:14,169
And I don't think my father
would want me to be one either.

1033
00:54:20,076 --> 00:54:21,510
"Although there has been
no official statement

1034
00:54:21,578 --> 00:54:22,944
from the crown,

1035
00:54:22,979 --> 00:54:24,813
the young lady in question
appears to be

1036
00:54:24,848 --> 00:54:26,748
Maggie Marks of Manhattan."

1037
00:54:26,784 --> 00:54:27,982
Nice alliteration.

1038
00:54:28,018 --> 00:54:29,284
Not funny.

1039
00:54:29,320 --> 00:54:31,286
It just goes on to say
that you are

1040
00:54:31,322 --> 00:54:34,690
a recent law school graduate
on vacation, bla bla bla.

1041
00:54:34,758 --> 00:54:38,460
Uh, there is no mention
of me anywhere.

1042
00:54:38,495 --> 00:54:40,962
This is bad. Right before
the coronation, too.

1043
00:54:40,997 --> 00:54:42,931
They must be going crazy
at the palace.

1044
00:54:42,966 --> 00:54:44,499
Did you talk to him yet?

1045
00:54:44,535 --> 00:54:47,336
- It keeps going to voicemail.
- [phone chiming]

1046
00:54:47,371 --> 00:54:49,371
- Adrian?
- No, it's Dad.

1047
00:54:49,440 --> 00:54:52,073
Oh, hi.
How are things at home?

1048
00:54:52,108 --> 00:54:54,976
<i>Not as hopping</i>
<i>as things are in Europe.</i>

1049
00:54:55,011 --> 00:54:56,244
That made the U.S. papers?

1050
00:54:56,279 --> 00:54:58,112
<i>No. You didn't call last night,</i>

1051
00:54:58,148 --> 00:54:59,948
so your father
Googled "Calpurnia"

1052
00:54:59,983 --> 00:55:02,083
to see if anything bad
was happening.

1053
00:55:02,118 --> 00:55:04,118
Maggie, what exactly
is going on there

1054
00:55:04,154 --> 00:55:05,687
<i>between you and this prince?</i>

1055
00:55:05,756 --> 00:55:07,823
Nothing. They're making
a big deal of nothing.

1056
00:55:07,858 --> 00:55:09,758
<i>Well, that's good</i>
<i>because from here,</i>

1057
00:55:09,793 --> 00:55:11,025
it looks rather embarrassing.

1058
00:55:11,094 --> 00:55:12,861
Dad, it was just a kiss.

1059
00:55:12,929 --> 00:55:15,697
<i>Brockton & Pierce take</i>
<i>appearances very seriously.</i>

1060
00:55:15,766 --> 00:55:18,700
So what do you want me to do?

1061
00:55:18,769 --> 00:55:21,135
That's not for me to decide.

1062
00:55:21,171 --> 00:55:23,137
You've got a good head
on your shoulders.

1063
00:55:23,173 --> 00:55:25,006
<i>I'm sure you'll</i>
<i>do the right thing.</i>

1064
00:55:25,075 --> 00:55:26,140
<i>Love you.</i>

1065
00:55:26,176 --> 00:55:27,942
Love you, too.

1066
00:55:27,978 --> 00:55:30,445
SARAH: What did he say?

1067
00:55:30,481 --> 00:55:33,348
I think he's expecting me
to go home.

1068
00:55:33,417 --> 00:55:35,450
Did he even ask you
if you like the guy?

1069
00:55:35,486 --> 00:55:37,085
No.

1070
00:55:37,120 --> 00:55:38,687
Out!

1071
00:55:40,957 --> 00:55:43,258
Out, out!

1072
00:55:49,099 --> 00:55:51,767
You got my text?

1073
00:55:51,802 --> 00:55:53,368
Are they still out there?

1074
00:55:53,437 --> 00:55:58,006
Yeah, just some of our more
die-hard journalists.

1075
00:55:58,074 --> 00:55:59,974
Vultures, really.

1076
00:56:01,912 --> 00:56:03,512
I'm so sorry.

1077
00:56:05,516 --> 00:56:09,017
Thank you.
It's not your fault.

1078
00:56:09,085 --> 00:56:11,787
I'm happy you're here.

1079
00:56:17,260 --> 00:56:18,627
Let's go to Paris.

1080
00:56:18,662 --> 00:56:19,861
What?

1081
00:56:19,930 --> 00:56:21,797
Yeah.
Just for a couple of days.

1082
00:56:21,832 --> 00:56:23,298
It'll be a lot more fun
than sneaking around here,

1083
00:56:23,333 --> 00:56:25,199
avoiding the vultures.

1084
00:56:25,268 --> 00:56:27,302
I'm not sure
that's such a good idea.

1085
00:56:27,337 --> 00:56:29,037
Well, your friend Sarah
can come, too, of course.

1086
00:56:29,105 --> 00:56:31,973
I'll get you guys your own
hotel suite, everything.

1087
00:56:32,008 --> 00:56:34,242
That's very generous of you.

1088
00:56:34,277 --> 00:56:37,813
but aren't you being crowned
in a few days?

1089
00:56:37,848 --> 00:56:40,916
That's all set in motion.

1090
00:56:40,951 --> 00:56:43,652
I'd rather
spend the time with you.

1091
00:56:43,687 --> 00:56:45,153
And I with you.

1092
00:56:45,188 --> 00:56:49,023
but right now
the whole country is watching,

1093
00:56:49,092 --> 00:56:51,159
waiting to see
what kind of king you'll be.

1094
00:56:51,194 --> 00:56:53,628
And running off to Paris
with some American girl

1095
00:56:53,664 --> 00:56:54,763
may not be the best idea.

1096
00:56:54,798 --> 00:56:57,966
You're not just some...

1097
00:56:58,001 --> 00:56:59,768
Do you know what?

1098
00:56:59,803 --> 00:57:02,971
It doesn't actually matter
what I do.

1099
00:57:03,006 --> 00:57:05,640
The tabloids will print
what they want.

1100
00:57:05,676 --> 00:57:07,241
Surprise them.

1101
00:57:07,277 --> 00:57:09,010
Tell them about
the children's foundation.

1102
00:57:09,079 --> 00:57:12,781
No. I wouldn't let them
use the kids as pawns,

1103
00:57:12,816 --> 00:57:15,684
even if it helps me.

1104
00:57:15,752 --> 00:57:18,252
You are so wonderful.

1105
00:57:18,288 --> 00:57:20,254
I want everyone to see that.

1106
00:57:20,290 --> 00:57:22,824
I'm just glad you see it.

1107
00:57:25,328 --> 00:57:26,928
[phone chiming]

1108
00:57:26,964 --> 00:57:28,196
Sorry.

1109
00:57:30,968 --> 00:57:32,333
The palace?

1110
00:57:32,369 --> 00:57:35,504
No, volleyball.
I have practice in half an hour.

1111
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:36,872
Do you wanna come?

1112
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:38,573
I would love to,

1113
00:57:38,609 --> 00:57:41,175
but I promised Sarah
I'd finally go shopping.

1114
00:57:41,244 --> 00:57:43,144
Ah, of course.

1115
00:57:43,179 --> 00:57:45,514
Well, try to stay clear
of the vultures,

1116
00:57:45,582 --> 00:57:48,082
and if you get into trouble,

1117
00:57:48,118 --> 00:57:50,018
this is Felix's number.

1118
00:57:50,086 --> 00:57:52,453
He'll extricate you
anytime, anywhere,

1119
00:57:52,489 --> 00:57:54,022
and bring you
straight to me.

1120
00:57:54,090 --> 00:57:55,690
Thank you.

1121
00:57:55,759 --> 00:57:59,093
Any other expert advice
on avoiding the press?

1122
00:57:59,129 --> 00:58:01,095
I have two words for you.

1123
00:58:01,131 --> 00:58:02,296
Yes?

1124
00:58:02,332 --> 00:58:05,534
Winter wardrobe.

1125
00:58:05,602 --> 00:58:09,671
Who knew your mom's clothes
would work well as a disguise?

1126
00:58:09,706 --> 00:58:11,706
Why don't you say it louder
so that everyone can hear you?

1127
00:58:11,775 --> 00:58:13,909
Sorry.

1128
00:58:13,944 --> 00:58:16,477
I can't believe
you turned down Paris.

1129
00:58:16,513 --> 00:58:18,346
I just met him this week.

1130
00:58:18,415 --> 00:58:20,515
So maybe he jumped the gun
a little bit.

1131
00:58:20,584 --> 00:58:22,517
- You think?
- But he's not just a guy.

1132
00:58:22,586 --> 00:58:24,285
He's a prince.

1133
00:58:24,320 --> 00:58:27,121
Remember Lenny Schwartzman
with the crazy beard,

1134
00:58:27,157 --> 00:58:29,424
who lived upstairs from me
on 23rd Street?

1135
00:58:29,459 --> 00:58:31,593
- Yeah.
- So we go out on a few dates,

1136
00:58:31,628 --> 00:58:32,794
couple of good night kisses,

1137
00:58:32,829 --> 00:58:34,429
next thing you know,

1138
00:58:34,464 --> 00:58:36,765
he wants me to drive
to the Poconos to meet his mom.

1139
00:58:36,800 --> 00:58:38,332
So?

1140
00:58:38,368 --> 00:58:41,369
So? Prince Adrian of Calpurnia
taking you to Paris

1141
00:58:41,438 --> 00:58:43,805
is Lenny Schwartzman
taking me to the Poconos.

1142
00:58:43,840 --> 00:58:45,139
They're royals.

1143
00:58:45,175 --> 00:58:46,575
They fly everywhere.

1144
00:58:46,610 --> 00:58:48,677
Who wouldn't wanna
live like that?

1145
00:58:48,745 --> 00:58:50,779
[phone chiming]

1146
00:58:50,814 --> 00:58:52,614
Oh, no.

1147
00:58:52,649 --> 00:58:54,348
They must have
seen the tabloids.

1148
00:58:54,417 --> 00:58:55,516
What?

1149
00:58:55,586 --> 00:58:57,085
I should take this.

1150
00:58:57,120 --> 00:58:59,120
- Hello?
<i>- Maggie?</i>

1151
00:58:59,155 --> 00:59:01,522
- It's Janice Brockton here.
<i>- Janice!</i>

1152
00:59:01,592 --> 00:59:03,925
- It's so nice to hear from you.
<i>- Likewise.</i>

1153
00:59:03,961 --> 00:59:06,160
Listen, we have
some news for you.

1154
00:59:06,196 --> 00:59:08,429
Look before you say anything,
the article, it wasn't--

1155
00:59:08,465 --> 00:59:09,764
What article?

1156
00:59:09,800 --> 00:59:11,800
Oh, uh...

1157
00:59:11,835 --> 00:59:13,969
<i>Maggie, it's not an article</i>
<i>we need to talk to you about.</i>

1158
00:59:14,004 --> 00:59:16,871
- It's a job.
- Really?

1159
00:59:16,940 --> 00:59:18,873
<i>JANICE: We'd like to offer you</i>
<i>a position here,</i>

1160
00:59:18,942 --> 00:59:20,842
<i>an associate position</i>
<i>in litigation.</i>

1161
00:59:20,911 --> 00:59:23,478
We're willing to make you
a very reasonable offer,

1162
00:59:23,513 --> 00:59:24,746
but there's a catch.

1163
00:59:24,781 --> 00:59:26,447
We need you to start right away.

1164
00:59:26,483 --> 00:59:27,849
How soon?

1165
00:59:27,918 --> 00:59:29,517
We need an answer
by tomorrow morning

1166
00:59:29,586 --> 00:59:31,285
<i>so we can get you started</i>
<i>on Monday.</i>

1167
00:59:31,321 --> 00:59:32,821
We're emailing you
the offer right now.

1168
00:59:32,856 --> 00:59:35,590
You're gonna make your dad
real proud, kid.

1169
00:59:35,626 --> 00:59:37,993
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

1170
00:59:39,429 --> 00:59:40,461
What's wrong?

1171
00:59:44,835 --> 00:59:46,968
WICKFORD: It's done.
They've offered her the job.

1172
00:59:47,004 --> 00:59:48,803
Did she accept?

1173
00:59:48,839 --> 00:59:50,171
They'll know for sure
tomorrow.

1174
00:59:50,206 --> 00:59:51,873
She's an ambitious girl,

1175
00:59:51,942 --> 00:59:55,476
but she struck me
as a little timid.

1176
00:59:55,512 --> 00:59:57,445
She'll go for the safe choice.

1177
00:59:57,480 --> 01:00:01,149
I'm so glad our background checks
proved useful, Your Majesty.

1178
01:00:13,569 --> 01:00:15,702
- There's really no choice.
- There's always a choice.

1179
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:18,404
Like what, give up the perfect
job for some guy I just met?

1180
01:00:18,473 --> 01:00:20,173
For a prince you just met.

1181
01:00:20,208 --> 01:00:21,407
That's irrelevant.

1182
01:00:21,476 --> 01:00:23,142
Let me rephrase that, counselor.

1183
01:00:23,178 --> 01:00:25,579
For a prince that you're
quickly falling for.

1184
01:00:25,647 --> 01:00:27,480
- I'm not.
- Oh, please!

1185
01:00:27,515 --> 01:00:28,882
Tell it to the judge.

1186
01:00:28,951 --> 01:00:31,217
How about this perfect job?

1187
01:00:31,286 --> 01:00:34,020
Would this be the meaningless
job that had you terrified

1188
01:00:34,056 --> 01:00:36,456
you'd reduce your life
to billable hours,

1189
01:00:36,491 --> 01:00:40,727
working in an office 24/7,
a cog in the machine?

1190
01:00:40,796 --> 01:00:42,662
[sighing]
I came here for a vacation,

1191
01:00:42,698 --> 01:00:45,899
not to have my life
turned upside-down.

1192
01:00:45,968 --> 01:00:47,667
Let me ask you a question.

1193
01:00:47,703 --> 01:00:50,536
Rushing back home like this,
does it make you happy?

1194
01:00:50,572 --> 01:00:51,705
Yes.

1195
01:00:51,740 --> 01:00:54,173
No. I--

1196
01:00:54,209 --> 01:00:57,510
There are more important things
in life than just being happy.

1197
01:00:57,545 --> 01:01:00,279
Oh, of course!
What was I thinking?

1198
01:01:13,561 --> 01:01:15,294
ADRIAN: All right, good game!

1199
01:01:15,330 --> 01:01:17,631
Well done!

1200
01:01:17,666 --> 01:01:19,332
BOYS: Bye!

1201
01:01:24,906 --> 01:01:26,072
Hey, stranger.

1202
01:01:26,141 --> 01:01:29,075
Hey. Can we talk?

1203
01:01:29,144 --> 01:01:30,476
Yeah.

1204
01:01:30,512 --> 01:01:33,212
Oh, but before I forget...

1205
01:01:35,851 --> 01:01:37,283
What's this?

1206
01:01:37,318 --> 01:01:39,719
It's from little Katia.

1207
01:01:39,788 --> 01:01:41,487
She made it for you.

1208
01:01:41,523 --> 01:01:44,658
She said it's a thank-you gift
for helping her sing.

1209
01:01:46,361 --> 01:01:47,994
What's wrong?

1210
01:01:51,232 --> 01:01:54,134
They offered me the job
in New York.

1211
01:01:54,169 --> 01:01:55,802
That's great.

1212
01:01:55,837 --> 01:01:58,905
They want me to start
right away.

1213
01:01:58,974 --> 01:02:00,740
Ah.

1214
01:02:00,809 --> 01:02:04,644
Well, when would you leave?

1215
01:02:04,680 --> 01:02:07,047
The day after tomorrow.

1216
01:02:07,082 --> 01:02:10,650
The day of your coronation.

1217
01:02:10,686 --> 01:02:12,351
I see.

1218
01:02:12,387 --> 01:02:13,386
Uh...

1219
01:02:16,224 --> 01:02:18,624
Well, of course you should go.

1220
01:02:18,660 --> 01:02:23,029
I mean, it would be crazy
for you not to, right?

1221
01:02:23,065 --> 01:02:24,330
Exactly.

1222
01:02:25,901 --> 01:02:28,868
This is the job
you weren't thrilled about.

1223
01:02:30,638 --> 01:02:32,471
It's a really good
career move.

1224
01:02:32,507 --> 01:02:35,008
The perfect one, really.

1225
01:02:35,043 --> 01:02:37,476
No, yeah, of course.

1226
01:02:37,512 --> 01:02:40,880
And I've been thinking,
I'm a huge distraction for you.

1227
01:02:40,949 --> 01:02:42,348
Like last night.

1228
01:02:42,383 --> 01:02:45,518
No, no,
that was just a hiccup.

1229
01:02:45,553 --> 01:02:47,954
Stuff like that
happens all the time.

1230
01:02:47,989 --> 01:02:52,058
To you, not to me.

1231
01:02:52,127 --> 01:02:56,229
See, we're from
really different worlds.

1232
01:02:56,297 --> 01:02:59,532
For me, being with someone
is a personal decision.

1233
01:02:59,567 --> 01:03:02,168
For you, it's an act of state.

1234
01:03:02,204 --> 01:03:04,170
Yeah.

1235
01:03:06,141 --> 01:03:09,675
Well, you've certainly
thought this through

1236
01:03:09,711 --> 01:03:11,211
for both of us.

1237
01:03:11,246 --> 01:03:14,981
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to...

1238
01:03:21,123 --> 01:03:22,122
All right.

1239
01:03:24,692 --> 01:03:30,630
Last night, you told me not to
try so hard to be someone else,

1240
01:03:30,665 --> 01:03:32,832
to find my own way to be king.

1241
01:03:32,868 --> 01:03:35,201
So I ask you,

1242
01:03:35,237 --> 01:03:39,338
and of course,
I'll respect your decision,

1243
01:03:39,374 --> 01:03:42,175
just make sure you're not
trying to live the life

1244
01:03:42,210 --> 01:03:44,677
you think you should,

1245
01:03:44,712 --> 01:03:46,646
instead of the life
you want.

1246
01:03:46,681 --> 01:03:49,448
What are you saying?

1247
01:03:49,484 --> 01:03:51,517
Stay.

1248
01:03:53,121 --> 01:03:54,988
Please.

1249
01:03:55,023 --> 01:03:57,657
I don't want to lose you.

1250
01:03:59,861 --> 01:04:02,495
I'm sorry. I can't.

1251
01:04:24,552 --> 01:04:26,986
I was thinking.

1252
01:04:27,022 --> 01:04:31,624
After the coronation,
I'll stop riding my bike.

1253
01:04:33,962 --> 01:04:36,696
Not too seemly for a monarch.

1254
01:04:43,671 --> 01:04:44,904
[sighs]

1255
01:05:07,829 --> 01:05:09,162
[phone ringing]

1256
01:05:13,301 --> 01:05:14,500
Hi.

1257
01:05:14,535 --> 01:05:16,402
<i>MAGGIE: Hi.</i>

1258
01:05:16,471 --> 01:05:19,172
<i>I wanted to see</i>
<i>if you were okay.</i>

1259
01:05:19,207 --> 01:05:20,740
Are you still leaving?

1260
01:05:20,808 --> 01:05:23,509
I'm sorry.

1261
01:05:23,544 --> 01:05:28,414
<i>Well, then I'm not so okay.</i>

1262
01:05:28,483 --> 01:05:31,117
But hey, at least
my mother's happy.

1263
01:05:31,152 --> 01:05:33,119
She's getting the coronation

1264
01:05:33,154 --> 01:05:35,388
and the son
that she always wanted.

1265
01:05:35,456 --> 01:05:37,390
Will she at least
let the public come,

1266
01:05:37,458 --> 01:05:39,325
give you something
to make it your own?

1267
01:05:39,361 --> 01:05:41,861
You met my mother just once,

1268
01:05:41,897 --> 01:05:45,664
so it's understandable
that you don't know her at all.

1269
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:48,401
And she doesn't know you at all,
not the real you.

1270
01:05:48,469 --> 01:05:49,835
You need to show her
who you are.

1271
01:05:49,871 --> 01:05:52,071
<i>Don't give up.</i>

1272
01:05:52,140 --> 01:05:53,873
Neither should you.

1273
01:05:57,145 --> 01:05:59,045
I guess I should pack.

1274
01:05:59,080 --> 01:06:01,881
And I have a speech
to memorize.

1275
01:06:01,917 --> 01:06:05,285
Has to be perfect
on the big day and all that.

1276
01:06:05,320 --> 01:06:07,887
Right, right, of course.
I'll let you go.

1277
01:06:07,956 --> 01:06:09,822
If you need anything...

1278
01:06:09,857 --> 01:06:12,125
I'll call.

1279
01:06:12,160 --> 01:06:13,226
You too.

1280
01:06:13,295 --> 01:06:14,294
Bye.

1281
01:06:47,862 --> 01:06:49,963
Felix? It's Maggie.

1282
01:06:49,998 --> 01:06:53,166
Is Adrian coaching the kids
today? What time?

1283
01:06:53,201 --> 01:06:56,635
No, no, it's not for me,
but I have a favor to ask

1284
01:06:56,671 --> 01:06:58,071
A big one.

1285
01:07:10,852 --> 01:07:12,118
[knocking]

1286
01:07:12,153 --> 01:07:13,619
Begging your pardon,
Your Majesty.

1287
01:07:13,654 --> 01:07:14,653
Yes.

1288
01:07:14,689 --> 01:07:15,721
You have a visitor.

1289
01:07:15,790 --> 01:07:17,523
I do?

1290
01:07:17,558 --> 01:07:19,058
There's nothing
scheduled until...

1291
01:07:25,467 --> 01:07:26,799
Ms. Marks.

1292
01:07:26,834 --> 01:07:29,035
I'm so sorry to intrude,
Your Majesty.

1293
01:07:29,070 --> 01:07:30,636
Did my son bring you?

1294
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:32,972
No, he has no idea I'm here.

1295
01:07:33,008 --> 01:07:35,341
I brought myself.

1296
01:07:35,377 --> 01:07:36,575
Don't blame Felix.

1297
01:07:36,644 --> 01:07:38,311
It's really important,

1298
01:07:38,346 --> 01:07:40,413
or I never would've barged in
on you like this.

1299
01:07:43,318 --> 01:07:45,451
I'm leaving tomorrow.
You'll never see me again

1300
01:07:45,487 --> 01:07:46,952
and neither will Adrian,

1301
01:07:46,988 --> 01:07:48,687
but there's something
I must tell you.

1302
01:07:51,359 --> 01:07:52,992

Really good work.
I'm very proud.

1332
01:09:23,521 --> 01:09:25,922
Um...

1333
01:09:25,990 --> 01:09:28,591
I'm going to let you in
on a secret.

1334
01:09:28,660 --> 01:09:31,226
I asked Madame here
to teach you that song

1335
01:09:31,262 --> 01:09:34,363
because it's very special to me.

1336
01:09:34,398 --> 01:09:38,500
You see, my dad
used to sing it to me

1337
01:09:38,536 --> 01:09:41,904
when I was a little boy, so...

1338
01:09:41,940 --> 01:09:46,375
thank you for making an old man
very happy.

1339
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:48,945
It was great.
Weren't they good?

1340
01:10:02,393 --> 01:10:04,727
What are you doing here?

1341
01:10:04,762 --> 01:10:07,196
That was quite something.

1342
01:10:07,231 --> 01:10:10,733
I remember your father
singing it to you.

1343
01:10:10,768 --> 01:10:17,073
So this is where you come
on your outings to town.

1344
01:10:17,108 --> 01:10:18,407
You--

1345
01:10:23,347 --> 01:10:25,214
This was all your idea?

1346
01:10:25,249 --> 01:10:27,549
Yes. Why did you
bring her here?

1347
01:10:27,585 --> 01:10:29,018
Oh, he didn't.

1348
01:10:29,053 --> 01:10:33,656
He drove me here,
but it wasn't his idea.

1349
01:10:33,691 --> 01:10:35,992
It was your friend Maggie's.

1350
01:10:36,027 --> 01:10:38,995
She arrived
at the palace uninvited.

1351
01:10:39,030 --> 01:10:42,564
She burst into my office
and demanded to be seen.

1352
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:47,503
Then she told me
I didn't know my own son.

1353
01:10:47,538 --> 01:10:49,939
She was adamant that there was
something I ought to see,

1354
01:10:50,008 --> 01:10:54,076
something that might convince me
he wasn't just a dilettante

1355
01:10:54,112 --> 01:10:56,712
gallivanting about town,

1356
01:10:56,748 --> 01:11:00,683
that he was a serious man,
ready to be a leader.

1357
01:11:00,718 --> 01:11:03,119
- Maggie told you all this?
- Yes.

1358
01:11:03,187 --> 01:11:08,057
She felt she owed it to you
before she left for America.

1359
01:11:08,092 --> 01:11:11,493
She's still leaving then?

1360
01:11:11,529 --> 01:11:12,695
Yes.

1361
01:11:18,235 --> 01:11:20,002
[sighs]

1362
01:11:21,673 --> 01:11:24,273
But...

1363
01:11:24,341 --> 01:11:26,709
I've had an idea.

1364
01:11:26,744 --> 01:11:30,579
We should invite the children
to sing at your coronation,

1365
01:11:30,614 --> 01:11:32,782
that very song.

1366
01:11:32,850 --> 01:11:35,851
It would be a beautiful tribute
to your father's memory.

1367
01:11:35,887 --> 01:11:39,088
You're serious?
Invite the children?

1368
01:11:39,157 --> 01:11:41,423
Yes.

1369
01:11:41,492 --> 01:11:44,760
Oh, for heaven sake,
let's just invite everybody.

1370
01:11:47,531 --> 01:11:49,065
Everybody?

1371
01:11:49,100 --> 01:11:50,833
Everybody.

1372
01:11:50,868 --> 01:11:52,568
Yes, yes!

1373
01:11:52,603 --> 01:11:56,172
[Adrian laughing]

1374
01:12:09,787 --> 01:12:11,721
[knocking]

1375
01:12:11,756 --> 01:12:13,655
HENRIK: Special delivery.

1376
01:12:18,730 --> 01:12:19,895
From the palace.

1377
01:12:19,931 --> 01:12:21,997
Invitations to the coronation.

1378
01:12:22,033 --> 01:12:24,834
- Thank you.
- For the first time in history,

1379
01:12:24,869 --> 01:12:27,603
the royal coronation has been
opened to all our citizens.

1380
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:30,039
Good night, miss.

1381
01:12:36,714 --> 01:12:38,413
We're invited to the coronation?

1382
01:12:38,449 --> 01:12:41,183
Wow. Maybe it worked.

1383
01:12:41,219 --> 01:12:43,719
You should go.

1384
01:12:43,755 --> 01:12:46,021
I can't. You go.

1385
01:12:46,057 --> 01:12:48,323
Oh, I'm definitely going.

1386
01:12:48,359 --> 01:12:51,026
I'm not cutting
my vacation short.

1387
01:12:51,062 --> 01:12:52,728
Wow.

1388
01:12:52,764 --> 01:12:56,365
It's beautiful!
Gold lettering?

1389
01:12:56,400 --> 01:13:00,702
Oh, you should definitely go.
It's the chance of a lifetime.

1390
01:13:00,738 --> 01:13:03,705
When's the next time you'll be
invited to a royal coronation?

1391
01:13:03,741 --> 01:13:07,176
Can't you get your dad to pull
some old-boy networking strings

1392
01:13:07,211 --> 01:13:08,778
and have them wait an extra day?

1393
01:13:08,846 --> 01:13:09,779
I can't.

1394
01:13:11,949 --> 01:13:16,451
Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry.

1395
01:13:16,520 --> 01:13:18,954
Of course I wanna go
see him become king,

1396
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:20,990
but I'm scared.

1397
01:13:21,025 --> 01:13:22,992
Of what?

1398
01:13:23,027 --> 01:13:25,995
That if I go,
I'll want to stay.

1399
01:13:26,030 --> 01:13:28,730
Would that be so bad?

1400
01:13:28,766 --> 01:13:30,732
My real life isn't here.
It's at home.

1401
01:13:30,768 --> 01:13:34,003
This is a vacation,
a fantasy.

1402
01:13:36,340 --> 01:13:40,542
Your life is
whatever you make it.

1403
01:13:58,930 --> 01:14:00,429
[knocking]

1404
01:14:02,834 --> 01:14:05,534
No need to put that on yet.

1405
01:14:05,569 --> 01:14:09,171
You've still got hours
before anyone shows up.

1406
01:14:09,207 --> 01:14:10,906
Couldn't sleep.

1407
01:14:10,942 --> 01:14:12,674
Neither could I.

1408
01:14:14,678 --> 01:14:17,079
She was right, you know.

1409
01:14:17,114 --> 01:14:19,882
You're going to make
a wonderful king.

1410
01:14:19,917 --> 01:14:22,617
I'm so...

1411
01:14:22,686 --> 01:14:25,020
very, very proud of you.

1412
01:14:27,725 --> 01:14:30,993
I'm sorry it took a complete
stranger to make me see.

1413
01:14:32,563 --> 01:14:34,096
Not a stranger.

1414
01:14:36,100 --> 01:14:37,699
Of course.

1415
01:14:39,270 --> 01:14:42,604
Forgive a foolish mother
her choice of words.

1416
01:14:42,673 --> 01:14:44,206
It's all right.

1417
01:14:48,112 --> 01:14:50,212
Oh, make sure to have breakfast.

1418
01:14:50,248 --> 01:14:52,748
These things can go on forever.

1419
01:14:56,254 --> 01:14:59,688
DESK CLERK: Here you go.
You enjoyed your stay?

1420
01:14:59,723 --> 01:15:01,656
MAGGIE: I did. Thank you.

1421
01:15:04,228 --> 01:15:06,395
I'm sorry to see you go, miss.

1422
01:15:06,430 --> 01:15:08,697
I'm sorry, too.

1423
01:15:09,767 --> 01:15:12,935
Thank you for everything.

1424
01:15:13,004 --> 01:15:15,004
Happy to be of service.

1425
01:15:15,039 --> 01:15:17,006
Let's get you
to your car then.

1426
01:15:17,041 --> 01:15:18,740
Car! Oh, my goodness.

1427
01:15:18,776 --> 01:15:21,944
I've been so all over the place,
I forgot to call a taxi.

1428
01:15:22,013 --> 01:15:24,880
I wouldn't exactly
call it a taxi, miss.

1429
01:15:37,728 --> 01:15:39,395
What's going on?

1430
01:15:39,430 --> 01:15:41,263
Someone wants a word.

1431
01:15:43,067 --> 01:15:45,000
I don't think I can.

1432
01:15:49,727 --> 01:15:51,927
Please.

1433
01:15:59,337 --> 01:16:01,237
Adrian, I--

1434
01:16:01,272 --> 01:16:02,438
Your Majesty.

1435
01:16:02,473 --> 01:16:04,506
Good morning, Miss Marks.

1436
01:16:04,575 --> 01:16:06,775
I know you're in a hurry.

1437
01:16:06,810 --> 01:16:08,744
Well, um, just my plane--

1438
01:16:08,779 --> 01:16:11,146
Oh, I'll have them hold
the plane if necessary.

1439
01:16:11,215 --> 01:16:13,482
Oh, thank you.

1440
01:16:13,551 --> 01:16:16,252
First of all, I came to
thank you for yesterday.

1441
01:16:16,287 --> 01:16:18,387
The children,

1442
01:16:18,422 --> 01:16:21,557
my son's work
at his foundation,

1443
01:16:21,592 --> 01:16:23,559
it really opened my eyes.

1444
01:16:23,594 --> 01:16:26,094
I'm glad, very glad.

1445
01:16:26,130 --> 01:16:28,830
And Adrian...

1446
01:16:28,899 --> 01:16:30,966
misses you.

1447
01:16:31,001 --> 01:16:34,470
He's really...

1448
01:16:34,505 --> 01:16:36,071
suffering without you.

1449
01:16:36,106 --> 01:16:38,274
I miss him, too.

1450
01:16:39,644 --> 01:16:41,577
I have a confession to make,

1451
01:16:41,612 --> 01:16:43,779
a rather embarrassing one.

1452
01:16:43,814 --> 01:16:48,116
Our family has sizable
business dealings in America.

1453
01:16:48,152 --> 01:16:51,620
A few days ago,
I instructed my chief of staff

1454
01:16:51,656 --> 01:16:54,623
to retain the firm
Brockton & Pierce

1455
01:16:54,659 --> 01:16:58,794
to represent us in three
very lucrative negotiations.

1456
01:16:58,829 --> 01:17:00,429
You--

1457
01:17:00,464 --> 01:17:03,399
I convinced them to offer you
the job you wanted.

1458
01:17:06,404 --> 01:17:08,970
To get rid of me?

1459
01:17:09,006 --> 01:17:12,908
Yes, as I am most ashamed
to admit.

1460
01:17:12,943 --> 01:17:16,111
Oh, you have to understand
they were delighted to have you.

1461
01:17:16,146 --> 01:17:20,882
You greatly impressed them,
so it wasn't a difficult push.

1462
01:17:20,918 --> 01:17:24,586
but it was wrong.

1463
01:17:24,622 --> 01:17:28,490
I thought
I was protecting my son.

1464
01:17:28,559 --> 01:17:31,960
But really I was
protecting myself.

1465
01:17:33,130 --> 01:17:35,931
So...

1466
01:17:35,966 --> 01:17:38,133
I'm going to make up for it.

1467
01:18:22,546 --> 01:18:24,112
What did he say?

1468
01:18:24,147 --> 01:18:27,115
It wasn't Adrian.
It was the queen.

1469
01:18:27,150 --> 01:18:29,918
- She offered me a job.
- What?

1470
01:18:29,953 --> 01:18:32,388
She wants to expand
Adrian's children's foundation,

1471
01:18:32,423 --> 01:18:33,822
not just here,
but all over Europe,

1472
01:18:33,891 --> 01:18:36,124
try to get other royal families
to participate.

1473
01:18:36,159 --> 01:18:37,893
And you'd be...

1474
01:18:37,928 --> 01:18:39,595
Its legal counsel.

1475
01:18:39,630 --> 01:18:42,731
Use my negotiation skills
to forge new partnerships.

1476
01:18:42,767 --> 01:18:44,900
So you'd get
to work with kids,

1477
01:18:44,935 --> 01:18:47,403
and you'd actually
be helping people?

1478
01:18:47,438 --> 01:18:49,671
This is so awesome.

1479
01:18:49,740 --> 01:18:52,307
That sure beats all-nighters
at Brockton & Pierce.

1480
01:18:52,342 --> 01:18:55,377
I gotta think about this.
It's all happening too fast.

1481
01:18:55,413 --> 01:18:57,979
My flight leaves in two hours.

1482
01:18:58,048 --> 01:19:00,482
- Shall I call for that taxi?
- Yes, please.

1483
01:19:04,755 --> 01:19:09,725
[bell tolling]

1484
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:13,228
And part of that pledge,

1485
01:19:13,263 --> 01:19:15,964
perhaps its most
important part,

1486
01:19:15,999 --> 01:19:19,100
is to make your concerns my own

1487
01:19:19,136 --> 01:19:23,171
and to listen to you,
all of you,

1488
01:19:23,240 --> 01:19:26,642
which is why it was so important
for me to have you here

1489
01:19:26,677 --> 01:19:28,577
because it is only through

1490
01:19:28,612 --> 01:19:30,412
the support and goodwill
of the people,

1491
01:19:30,448 --> 01:19:32,781
each and every citizen--

1492
01:19:32,817 --> 01:19:36,151
yes, even the members
of our ubiquitous press--

1493
01:19:36,219 --> 01:19:39,421
[laughter]

1494
01:19:39,457 --> 01:19:43,892
that monarchy has any place
at all in a modern government.

1495
01:19:48,131 --> 01:19:52,167
As someone very special to me
recently told me...

1496
01:19:54,137 --> 01:19:56,672
I'm more of a doer
than a talker.

1497
01:19:58,442 --> 01:20:02,243
So it is with a humble heart
and doors open to all

1498
01:20:02,279 --> 01:20:05,647
that I ask you
to let me show you

1499
01:20:05,716 --> 01:20:09,250
what I can do for Calpurnia

1500
01:20:09,286 --> 01:20:12,621
and for each
and every one of you.

1501
01:20:12,656 --> 01:20:13,922
Thank you.

1502
01:20:37,280 --> 01:20:40,115
BISHOP: Your Highness?

1503
01:20:40,150 --> 01:20:41,783
Your Highness?

1504
01:20:45,723 --> 01:20:47,389
So much for listening.

1505
01:20:47,424 --> 01:20:49,725
[laughter]

1506
01:20:53,497 --> 01:20:55,898
[drumbeats continue]

1507
01:21:21,324 --> 01:21:22,991
BISHOP: Ladies and gentlemen,

1508
01:21:23,060 --> 01:21:25,928
citizens and loyal subjects all,

1509
01:21:25,963 --> 01:21:28,964
may I present
His Royal Majesty

1510
01:21:28,999 --> 01:21:31,934
King Adrian of Calpurnia.

1511
01:21:31,969 --> 01:21:34,570
Long may he reign.

1512
01:21:34,605 --> 01:21:36,438
Long live the king!

1513
01:21:36,473 --> 01:21:39,474
Long live King Adrian!

1514
01:21:59,429 --> 01:22:02,430
[soft chatter]

1515
01:22:02,466 --> 01:22:05,333
Congratulations, Your Majesty.
If you'll follow me this way,

1516
01:22:05,402 --> 01:22:06,568
the press would like
a few photographs.

1517
01:22:06,604 --> 01:22:08,336
I'm sorry, I just need a minute.

1518
01:22:08,405 --> 01:22:11,473
- But, sir, they've been--
- Wickford, they can wait.

1519
01:22:11,508 --> 01:22:14,643
Of course, Your Majesty,
as you wish.

1520
01:22:18,782 --> 01:22:20,415
You're here.

1521
01:22:20,450 --> 01:22:22,818
You sent the invitation,
gold lettering and all.

1522
01:22:22,886 --> 01:22:24,886
What about your job?

1523
01:22:24,922 --> 01:22:27,255
A mysterious stranger
once told me,

1524
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:30,058
after destroying my hat,
mind you,

1525
01:22:30,094 --> 01:22:33,561
that I shouldn't follow
someone else's plan.

1526
01:22:37,400 --> 01:22:41,103
And I may have some new ones.

1527
01:22:41,138 --> 01:22:43,805
Might they include
you sticking around for a while?

1528
01:22:43,841 --> 01:22:45,674
Well, that's the thing.

1529
01:22:45,743 --> 01:22:47,509
I was thinking...

1530
01:22:47,577 --> 01:22:51,412
if I'm gonna give up
the job of a lifetime...

1531
01:22:51,448 --> 01:22:53,414
Yes?

1532
01:22:53,450 --> 01:22:55,383
I might need to be persuaded.

1533
01:23:02,826 --> 01:23:04,893
How's that for a start?

1534
01:23:04,928 --> 01:23:06,828
You're getting there.
