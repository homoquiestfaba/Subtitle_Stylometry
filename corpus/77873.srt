00:23:37,782 --> 00:23:40,273
Of course l'm having it.

333
00:23:40,351 --> 00:23:43,616
l just wanted to shake her up,
that's all.

334
00:23:43,688 --> 00:23:46,657
<i>[Roxeanne]</i>
<i>My husband no longer lives at home.</i>

00:23:46,724 --> 00:23:49,852
<i>[Man] You're the innocent party.</i>
<i>You can file a suit.</i>

336
00:23:51,028 --> 00:23:53,963
l don't want to.
It's all my husband's idea.

337
00:23:55,299 --> 00:23:57,233
If Mr. de Persand
took you to court...

338
00:23:57,301 --> 00:23:59,462
he'd need to make a case.

339
00:23:59,537 --> 00:24:02,563
<i>Violence, cruelty, adultery.</i>

340
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:04,870
He couldn't possibly say
any of those things.

341
00:24:04,942 --> 00:24:06,876
No, of course not.

342
00:24:06,944 --> 00:24:09,071
Yhe offense is totally mine.

343
00:24:09,147 --> 00:24:11,342
Yhe injured party asks for divorce.

344
00:24:11,415 --> 00:24:13,906
<i>l keep telling you,</i>
<i>l don't want a divorce.</i>

345
00:24:13,985 --> 00:24:17,622
l oppose divorce on principle,
entirely and utterly.

346
00:24:17,755 --> 00:24:20,918
Yhere is also the question
of division of property.

347
00:24:20,992 --> 00:24:24,325
Unfortunately, you have signed
a prenuptial agreement.

348
00:24:24,395 --> 00:24:26,886
Yhat complicates matters.

349
00:24:26,964 --> 00:24:29,694
<i>You are entitled to half</i>
<i>of your wife's property...</i>

350
00:24:29,767 --> 00:24:32,258
and Madame de Persand
has the same claim on yours.

351
00:24:32,336 --> 00:24:35,601
l don't want anything
from the apartment.

352
00:24:35,673 --> 00:24:38,005
Yhings that came
from my family, perhaps.

353
00:24:38,075 --> 00:24:40,168
l'll let my mother
and brother decide...

354
00:24:40,244 --> 00:24:42,405
if there's anything that
shouldn't go out of the family.

355
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,641
Your children are your family.

356
00:24:44,715 --> 00:24:47,343
Yhings going to your children
are not going out of your family.

357
00:24:47,418 --> 00:24:50,979
- l was thinking of things going to the U.S.
- l'm not going to the U.S.

358
00:24:51,055 --> 00:24:53,683
l am staying right here.

359
00:24:57,028 --> 00:24:59,861
When would remarriage
be permitted?

360
00:24:59,930 --> 00:25:01,864
Once divorce is granted...

361
00:25:01,932 --> 00:25:05,368
you're perfectly free to remarry.

362
00:25:05,436 --> 00:25:09,395
But your wife must wait
until she gives birth.

363
00:25:09,473 --> 00:25:13,637
Yhat's unbelievable. In California,
l could remarry as soon as l wanted.

364
00:25:13,711 --> 00:25:17,203
Do you mean to tell me that in France
the law is different for men and women?

365
00:25:17,281 --> 00:25:20,739
- For obvious reasons.
- No, it isn't obvious to me.
l don't want to listen to this.

366
00:25:20,818 --> 00:25:23,946
<i>It's not me who's asked for a divorce.</i>
<i>l don't want a divorce.</i>

367
00:25:24,021 --> 00:25:26,649
<i>And l really don't wanna see you...</i>

368
00:25:26,724 --> 00:25:29,852
or speak to you or sit in
the same room with you ever again.

369
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:34,097

[In French]

372
00:26:01,125 --> 00:26:03,787
During my research
for an exhibition catalogue...

373
00:26:03,861 --> 00:26:08,628
l ran across a piece in the inventory
of the estate of a Dr. William Walker.

374
00:26:08,699 --> 00:26:10,633
- Our father's uncle.
- Exactly.

375
00:26:10,701 --> 00:26:14,330
Your uncle bought it in the 1 930s in
the Rue du Bac in Paris from a dealer...

376
00:26:14,405 --> 00:26:16,930
and it was still in the inventory
of his estate...

377
00:26:17,007 --> 00:26:19,168
<i>at the time ofhis death in 1 979.</i>

378
00:26:19,243 --> 00:26:21,404
It then passed into the possession...

379
00:26:21,479 --> 00:26:25,142
of a Dr. Chester Walker
of Santa Barbara, your father.

380
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:28,242
- l tracked it down in the court records.
- Did l hear you say...

381
00:26:28,319 --> 00:26:32,050
the insurance value, when we ship it
to the Getty, is $40,000?

382
00:26:32,123 --> 00:26:34,683
- Yes, at least that. Yeah.
- And to think, all these years...

383
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,990
it's been hanging in total obscurity
in our house in Santa Barbara.

384
00:26:38,062 --> 00:26:40,326
God, Roxy, would you ever believe
this would've happened?

385
00:26:40,397 --> 00:26:42,558
See, what's so incredible
to us at the Getty...

386
00:26:42,633 --> 00:26:47,297
is that no one here saw that it
had any resemblance to La Your.

387
00:26:47,371 --> 00:26:50,704
Yhe French are always so very quick
to claim anything good as their own.

388
00:26:50,775 --> 00:26:53,369
Hmm. Sounds like
my husband and his lawyer.

389
00:26:55,880 --> 00:27:00,010
Can you believe they're talking
about division of property?

390
00:27:02,086 --> 00:27:05,749
Oh, l'm usually the cautious
museum curator...

391
00:27:05,823 --> 00:27:08,815
but l have a fair hunch...

392
00:27:08,893 --> 00:27:11,885
that this may be
by La Your himself.

393
00:27:11,962 --> 00:27:14,556
Well, there are a lot of little things
and they all add up.

394

there's his palette, his color.

See how the light from the candle...

396
00:27:21,572 --> 00:27:23,631

397
00:27:23,707 --> 00:27:25,868

Yoday they're the victims.
Yomorrow, who knows.

409
00:27:59,376 --> 00:28:04,871
Because the world is ruled by hawks
and arms dealers and minority phobias.

415
00:28:28,339 --> 00:28:30,273
He is a lawyer who
specializes in divorce.

416
00:28:30,341 --> 00:28:33,367
- Oh, no, please.
- His firm has connections with America.

417
00:28:33,444 --> 00:28:35,935
l couldn't stand to hear
another lawyer talk about divorce.

418
00:28:36,013 --> 00:28:38,345
By consent,
by mutual consent, by action.

419
00:28:38,415 --> 00:28:41,475
<i>Maître Bertram,</i>
<i>Madame de Persand.</i>

420
00:28:41,552 --> 00:28:45,283
- Her sister, Isabel.
- Hi. Nice to meet you.

421
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:48,325
Now, l have talked with <i>Maître Bertram</i>
about your Saint Ursula...

422
00:28:48,392 --> 00:28:51,020
<i>and he does not think it's a good idea</i>
<i>that you send her to California.</i>

423
00:28:51,095 --> 00:28:53,928
Could l advise you?

424
00:28:53,998 --> 00:28:56,193
If you were to send your picture
to the Getty Museum...

425
00:28:56,267 --> 00:28:58,360
it might seem a trick
to get it out of France...

426
00:28:58,435 --> 00:29:00,369
and that might jeopardize
the rest of the divorce.

427
00:29:00,437 --> 00:29:03,065
It could be interpreted
as an act of bad faith.

428
00:29:03,140 --> 00:29:05,973
<i>What if l just rolled it up</i>
<i>and took it in my suitcase?</i>

429
00:29:06,043 --> 00:29:08,307
You could invite charges

- How is that my fault?
- l'm thinking of the family.

822
00:58:37,811 --> 00:58:41,178
Custody, division of property,
alimony payments.

823
00:58:41,248 --> 00:58:44,217
Consider what you're doing.

824
00:58:44,284 --> 00:58:49,449
We'll see you on Sunday, l trust.
Good-bye.

825
00:58:49,523 --> 00:58:51,457
Voilà.

826
00:59:00,467 --> 00:59:02,731
<i>Saint Ursula belonged</i>
<i>to our great-uncle...</i>

827
00:59:02,803 --> 00:59:07,240
<i>who left it to our father, and</i>
<i>your family has absolutely no say in it.</i>

828
00:59:07,307 --> 00:59:10,140
Who is Saint Ursula?
Yhe patron saint of schoolgirls.

829
00:59:10,210 --> 00:59:12,974
Yhe painting doesn't mean
a thing to your family...

830
00:59:13,046 --> 00:59:15,606
except to be split 50-50
in a divorce.

831
00:59:15,682 --> 00:59:18,549
We're not going to quarrel, you and I,
about Roxeanne's ugly saint.

832
00:59:25,759 --> 00:59:30,594
l've told you a purse of this kind
is not suitable for every occasion.

833
00:59:30,664 --> 00:59:33,292
l'd suggest a small,
black evening bag.

834
00:59:33,366 --> 00:59:36,767
You can talk about everything else.
My evening bag?

835
00:59:38,138 --> 00:59:41,767
Yhen go on YV,
talk about religion...

836
00:59:41,842 --> 00:59:44,538
- morality, sex.
- [Applause]

837
00:59:45,779 --> 00:59:48,247
Why not about money?

838
00:59:56,256 --> 00:59:58,690
Is money an unmentionable subject
with you?

839
00:59:58,758 --> 01:00:01,420
Shh.

840
01:00:01,495 --> 01:00:03,725
<i>[Man Singing Opera]</i>

841
01:00:40,333 --> 01:00:42,995
No, it's not a La Your.
It's obvious.

842
01:00:44,304 --> 01:00:47,432
"In the manner of'
at the very best.

843
01:00:47,507 --> 01:00:49,441
Of no interest to us.

844
01:00:49,509 --> 01:00:52,910
l may not be a specialist,
but it's not obvious to me.

845
01:00:52,979 --> 01:00:58,383
If the Getty Museum sees the resemblance
to La Your, how can you be so sure?

846
01:00:58,451 --> 01:01:01,978
Why would we supplement
our collection of French paintings...

847
01:01:02,055 --> 01:01:07,425
<i>with family heirlooms</i>
<i>from an American attic?</i>

848
01:01:07,494 --> 01:01:12,158
It's of no interest
to the Louvre... at all.

849
01:01:14,434 --> 01:01:17,597
It's just so tacky.
Charles-Henri taking Roxy's painting.

850
01:01:17,671 --> 01:01:20,640
<i>l would never try to take something</i>
<i>from him that he grew up with.</i>

851
01:01:22,576 --> 01:01:25,443
<i>Oh, sorry. l'm very sorry.</i>

852
01:01:25,512 --> 01:01:27,446
- l didn't mean it.
- l'll get it.

853
01:01:30,083 --> 01:01:32,017
Why are you doing this now?

854
01:01:32,085 --> 01:01:34,280
Couldn't you have at least waited
till her baby's born?

855
01:01:34,354 --> 01:01:38,688
Well, there has to be a valuation
before there can be a division and sale.

856
01:01:38,758 --> 01:01:41,124
You'd think Charles-Henri
would wanna have his kids...

857
01:01:41,194 --> 01:01:44,891
have the furniture and the painting,
not some strangers buying them.

858
01:01:44,965 --> 01:01:47,160
He's just being a terrible shit.

859
01:01:47,233 --> 01:01:49,167
Or he's getting bad advice.

860
01:01:49,235 --> 01:01:51,635
Charles-Henri has left this up to me.

861
01:01:52,973 --> 01:01:55,134
You then are being a terrible shit.

862
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:07,713
And if it really were a La Your?

863
01:02:07,787 --> 01:02:09,721
Yhat would be a different matter.

864
01:02:09,789 --> 01:02:14,954
But you have a nice commode,
Louis XV-XVI.

865
01:02:15,028 --> 01:02:18,020
- How much is it worth?
- About 50,000.

866
01:02:18,098 --> 01:02:22,000
- More if it's stamped.
- Let's pull it out and check.
