1
00:01:31,789 --> 00:01:32,789
Ah, Beach.

2
00:01:33,953 --> 00:01:35,620
Your whiskey, Mr Galahad.

3
00:01:35,961 --> 00:01:36,999
Good man, Beach.

4
00:01:37,601 --> 00:01:39,341
Do you happen to know where my sister is?

5
00:01:39,366 --> 00:01:41,747
Lady Constance is in the drawing room, sir.

6
00:01:41,772 --> 00:01:42,772
Alone?

7
00:01:42,969 --> 00:01:44,868
Yes sir.
Soda, sir?

8
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:48,625
No thank you Beach,
I think for what's ahead of me...

9
00:01:51,803 --> 00:01:52,803
Tell me Beach,

10
00:01:53,255 --> 00:01:56,471
who was the chap who did
the "far, far better thing"?

11
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:59,429
Sydney Carton,
going to the guillotine, sir.

12
00:01:59,687 --> 00:02:00,697
Oh, well.

13
00:02:00,722 --> 00:02:03,260
Always someone with more
to lose, I suppose.

14
00:02:03,285 --> 00:02:05,353
No risk of my brother Clarence
butting in, is there?

15
00:02:05,378 --> 00:02:06,511
I think not, sir.

16
00:02:06,893 --> 00:02:09,093
His Lordship is with the Empress.

17
00:02:33,495 --> 00:02:34,963
Coast clear, your Lordship?

18
00:02:34,988 --> 00:02:36,448
Coast clear!

19
00:02:37,518 --> 00:02:40,192
- Commence the operation, your Lordship?
- Yes?

20
00:02:40,613 --> 00:02:41,954
Commence, ah...

21
00:02:43,173 --> 00:02:44,525
- commence!
- Look, I say!

22
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:47,127
- I wonder if I'm the right sort of chap
- Carbody!

23
00:02:47,152 --> 00:02:49,209
- Car-mody, your Lordship.
- What!

24
00:02:49,234 --> 00:02:50,501
My name is Carmody.

25
00:02:50,526 --> 00:02:54,383
I don't care what your name is.
Commence!

26
00:03:34,736 --> 00:03:37,045
How did he do,
how did he do?

27
00:03:37,070 --> 00:03:38,747
15 seconds, my Lord.

28
00:03:38,772 --> 00:03:41,702
In my opinion, not good enough.
They could have poisoned the pig by then.

29
00:03:41,727 --> 00:03:45,004
You hear that, Pirbright?  Not good enough!

30
00:03:45,029 --> 00:03:46,030
Huh?

31
00:03:46,055 --> 00:03:49,658
Pilbeam knows, you see?
Pilbeam is a...

32
00:03:51,664 --> 00:03:54,397
- Is a...
- Private invetigator, milord.

33
00:03:54,906 --> 00:03:56,719
Argus Enquiries Agency.

34
00:03:56,744 --> 00:03:57,658
Huh!

35
00:03:57,683 --> 00:04:01,095
I've hired him to watch
for any move from Parsloe,

36
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:03,505
I'm telling you the man
will stop at nothing

37
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:05,773
to get that gold medal, so!

38
00:04:07,078 --> 00:04:08,345
What do we call it?

39
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:09,505
Vigilance, my lord.

40
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:12,224
Vigilance, Pirbright!
Understand?

41
00:04:12,249 --> 00:04:13,249
Oh, aye!

42
00:04:13,988 --> 00:04:17,950
You cannot be vigilant lying down there!

43
00:04:17,975 --> 00:04:19,200
No, milud!

44
00:04:22,370 --> 00:04:23,966
Where's Carbody?

45
00:04:26,074 --> 00:04:28,924
Carmody, milord,
Hugo Carmody!

46
00:04:29,255 --> 00:04:32,469
Good heavens, you fool!
Come out of there!

47
00:04:32,494 --> 00:04:34,914
You could be infecting the Empress!

48
00:04:34,939 --> 00:04:38,525
May I remind you, my lord, that I am
supposed to be your secretary!

49
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:40,946
Doesn't stop you carrying germs.

50
00:04:41,302 --> 00:04:43,704
Pirbright, get him out of there.

51
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:44,813
I resign!

52
00:04:44,838 --> 00:04:46,993
- Aargh!
- I resign!

53
00:04:47,234 --> 00:04:48,462
I resign!

54
00:04:48,955 --> 00:04:50,170
I resign!

55
00:04:50,195 --> 00:04:52,325
Never liked the fellow.

56
00:04:52,549 --> 00:04:54,654
Not sound on pigs.

57
00:05:02,204 --> 00:05:04,400
Good heavens,
what's the matter with Hugo?

58
00:05:04,425 --> 00:05:05,983
He seems terribly upset.

59
00:05:06,008 --> 00:05:08,108
I don't like the way
that man smiles at you.

60
00:05:08,133 --> 00:05:11,560
Oh Ronnie!
Don't tell me you're jealous of Hugo!

61
00:05:11,585 --> 00:05:13,490
I'm jealous of everyone, you know I am.

62
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,873
Well you mustn't be,
you did promise me you'd try!

63
00:05:15,873 --> 00:05:17,284
I know, I know.

64
00:05:18,057 --> 00:05:22,057
It's just that I love you so much
and I'm just so dashed...

65
00:05:23,403 --> 00:05:24,403
short.

66
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,773
You're just the right height.

67
00:05:26,798 --> 00:05:28,851
And...pink.

68
00:05:29,345 --> 00:05:30,814
My favorite color.

69
00:05:31,188 --> 00:05:34,916
You're a precious little pink
cherub and I love you.

70
00:05:38,485 --> 00:05:39,485
You really do?

71
00:05:39,754 --> 00:05:41,117
Of course I do.

72
00:05:43,227 --> 00:05:45,391
I wish you didn't have to go away.

73
00:05:45,416 --> 00:05:47,187
Oh, can't he find
another best man?

74
00:05:47,212 --> 00:05:49,279
Oh I can't let old George down.

75
00:05:49,304 --> 00:05:52,137
- It'll only be for one night.
- I know.

76
00:05:52,781 --> 00:05:55,233
But I'm scared of this place,

77
00:05:55,258 --> 00:05:57,575
it's so big and old.

78
00:05:57,832 --> 00:06:00,997
Yes, I suppose it is a fairly
decent-sized old shack.

79
00:06:02,189 --> 00:06:04,532
I've never really given the thing
much thought before.

80
00:06:04,853 --> 00:06:07,260
But there's nothing in it
to scare anyone.

81
00:06:07,694 --> 00:06:09,994
There's your Aunt Constance
for a start.

82
00:06:10,019 --> 00:06:12,124
Look, if Aunt Constance gives
any trouble while I'm away

83
00:06:12,149 --> 00:06:14,335
you have my permission
to punch her in the eye!

84
00:06:15,501 --> 00:06:19,486
I cannot believe that your proposal
is a serious one.

85
00:06:19,712 --> 00:06:21,150
Yes, Connie, it is.

86
00:06:21,444 --> 00:06:25,366
You really expect me to give my blessing
to a marriage between my nephew,

87
00:06:25,686 --> 00:06:27,295
and a chorus-girl?!

88
00:06:27,465 --> 00:06:29,543
Sue is a very beautiful chorus-girl.

89
00:06:29,887 --> 00:06:32,247
Galahad, I am not a snob.

90
00:06:32,426 --> 00:06:33,887
Oh Connie, you are.

91
00:06:34,104 --> 00:06:36,391
I know my nephew's station in life,

92
00:06:36,416 --> 00:06:37,869
and I know hers.

93
00:06:37,932 --> 00:06:40,510
And never the twain can
meet in matrimony.

94
00:06:40,555 --> 00:06:42,574
Why not? After all,
it was very nearly

95
00:06:42,599 --> 00:06:44,790
 the twain of myself
and Sue's mother.

96
00:06:44,815 --> 00:06:46,632
I don't want Ronnie to make
the mistake I did.

97
00:06:46,657 --> 00:06:47,961
You mean the mistake you
would have made

98
00:06:47,986 --> 00:06:50,008
if you hadn't been
shipped off to South Africa.

99
00:06:50,033 --> 00:06:51,053
And anyway,

100
00:06:51,078 --> 00:06:55,157
your early life, or even later life, 
is not a model I could recommend others to follow.

101
00:06:56,055 --> 00:06:57,552
Which brings us right back

102
00:06:57,858 --> 00:06:59,170
to my memoirs.

103
00:06:59,482 --> 00:07:02,762
You really mean to publish
that shameful book?

104
00:07:02,787 --> 00:07:04,733
I have an advance
from Mammoth Publications.

105
00:07:04,758 --> 00:07:06,841
They can't wait for the copies
to roll off the press.

106
00:07:06,935 --> 00:07:09,034
You remember dear old
Lady Wensleydale's opus,

107
00:07:09,059 --> 00:07:11,409
"Sixty Years Near The
Knuckle in Mayfair"?

108
00:07:11,448 --> 00:07:14,730
Over 100,000 copies they've sold,
be chicken feed compared to this.

109
00:07:14,755 --> 00:07:18,260
You realize we will lose
every friend we have?

110
00:07:18,285 --> 00:07:21,348
A small price to pay for giving the world
a great work of literature.

111
00:07:24,184 --> 00:07:25,700
Galahad,

112
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:28,371
I appeal to your better nature.

113
00:07:29,041 --> 00:07:30,478
Connie I don't have one.

114
00:07:30,503 --> 00:07:34,439
At the very least you will agree to excise
all mention of Sir Gregory Parsloe!

115
00:07:34,557 --> 00:07:36,172
- Sir Gregory Parsloe?
- Yes.

116
00:07:36,197 --> 00:07:38,025
He features in some of the juiciest bits.

117
00:07:38,337 --> 00:07:41,506
Let me read you about what happened
after Buffy Bango's party

118
00:07:41,531 --> 00:07:43,898
at the Club Bohemia in '92.

119
00:07:44,595 --> 00:07:47,814
"Young Gregory, needless to say,
was absolutely..."

120
00:07:47,839 --> 00:07:49,571
...do not wish to hear.

121
00:07:50,235 --> 00:07:52,710
At the next election, Sir
Gregory is planning to stand

122
00:07:52,735 --> 00:07:55,322
as the Conservative
and Unionist candidate.

123
00:07:55,548 --> 00:07:58,407
Wouldn't put money on it.
You'd best agree to my terms.

124
00:07:58,587 --> 00:08:01,051
I cannot give this marriage my blessing.

125
00:08:01,076 --> 00:08:03,605
They don't want your blessing,
what Ronnie wants is his money.

126
00:08:03,630 --> 00:08:04,917
He can't marry without it.

127
00:08:04,942 --> 00:08:06,535
Clarence is his trustee.

128
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,357
You have told Clarence not to pay up,
and Clarence is afraid of you.

129
00:08:10,464 --> 00:08:13,058
Afraid!
Of me?

130
00:08:14,582 --> 00:08:18,025
I may influence Clarence
in some ways, yes.

131
00:08:18,050 --> 00:08:20,026
But only because
he needs me to.

132
00:08:20,051 --> 00:08:22,723
He needs you to let him
give Ronnie the money.

133
00:08:25,375 --> 00:08:29,742
If I do, you will agree
not to publish the book.

134
00:08:30,258 --> 00:08:33,085
For those two,
I will make the supreme sacrifice.

135
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,992
I cannot speak for Ronald's mother,
you realize that.

136
00:08:36,295 --> 00:08:37,746
Speak for yourself.

137
00:08:37,771 --> 00:08:40,519
By the time Julia gets home, they will,
with any luck, be spliced.

138
00:08:40,544 --> 00:08:44,287
It's against my judgement,
my beliefs, and my principles.

139
00:08:44,312 --> 00:08:46,637
- In other words, it's a deal.
- Yes.

140
00:08:56,659 --> 00:08:59,948
He can't do this to me!
It's monstrous!

141
00:09:00,542 --> 00:09:03,189
He's taken the advance,
he can't back out now.

142
00:09:03,214 --> 00:09:05,245
He's returned the advance, Lord Tilbury.

143
00:09:05,270 --> 00:09:08,376
I don't want the advance,
I want the profits from the book!

144
00:09:09,830 --> 00:09:11,026
Er, I mean, uh,

145
00:09:11,051 --> 00:09:13,674
I want the public to have the book.

146
00:09:16,255 --> 00:09:17,904
He won't get away with this.

147
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:22,309
The "Honorable" Galahad Threepwood
will learn he's met his match.

148
00:09:22,334 --> 00:09:25,816
Authors!
They won't get the better of me.

149
00:09:25,841 --> 00:09:28,817
The certainly do not,
Lord Tilbury.

150
00:09:32,505 --> 00:09:33,849
What else?

151
00:09:34,261 --> 00:09:37,805
I have the new editions of our weekly
papers, if you'd like to peruse them.

152
00:09:37,830 --> 00:09:40,470
Aye.
Tiny Tots.

153
00:09:41,556 --> 00:09:44,782
That should soothe
the jangled nerves.

154
00:09:45,112 --> 00:09:49,258
Read me "Uncle Woggly's Advice
To His Chicks".

155
00:09:53,157 --> 00:09:55,430
"Uncle Woggly To His Chicks"

156
00:09:56,545 --> 00:09:59,199
"Well, Chickakiddies,
how are you all?"

157
00:09:59,644 --> 00:10:02,745
"Minding what Nursie says
and eating your spinach?"

158
00:10:03,363 --> 00:10:07,308
"This week, Uncle Woggly is going
to put you onto a good thing."

159
00:10:07,749 --> 00:10:11,240
"We all want to make a spot
of easy money, don't we?"

160
00:10:11,265 --> 00:10:15,084
"Well here's the low down,
straight from the horse's mouth."

161
00:10:15,638 --> 00:10:18,308
"All you've got to do
is to get hold of some mug"

162
00:10:18,333 --> 00:10:20,513
"and lure him into betting"

163
00:10:20,556 --> 00:10:24,275
"that a quart whisky bottle holds
more than a quart of whisky."

164
00:10:24,567 --> 00:10:26,057
"Sounds rummy, what?"

165
00:10:26,082 --> 00:10:27,658
Who wrote this?

166
00:10:27,683 --> 00:10:28,690
Who wrote it?

167
00:10:28,715 --> 00:10:30,875
Well it's usually the Reverend
Aubrey Sellick.

168
00:10:30,900 --> 00:10:32,876
He wrote that?!?

169
00:10:32,904 --> 00:10:35,264
Reverend Sellick is on holiday,
Lord Tilbury.

170
00:10:35,289 --> 00:10:39,048
In his absence,
Mr Bodkin is deputizing.

171
00:10:40,146 --> 00:10:41,146
Who is it?

172
00:10:41,170 --> 00:10:43,201
Monty Bodkin, milord.

173
00:10:48,838 --> 00:10:50,127
Come in, Bodkin.

174
00:10:51,330 --> 00:10:53,799
Good morning,
good morning, good morning.

175
00:10:53,822 --> 00:10:54,992
Nice day.

176
00:10:55,017 --> 00:10:56,736
- Never mind the day.
- Right ho.

177
00:10:56,987 --> 00:10:59,260
- Don't say "right ho".
- Right ho.

178
00:10:59,821 --> 00:11:02,469
I wondered if you'd had a chance
to look at my Uncle Woggly.

179
00:11:02,883 --> 00:11:04,829
A little of it.

180
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,454
Perhaps you'd be good enough
to read it to me.

181
00:11:10,474 --> 00:11:12,154
From...

182
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,130
- there.
- Right ho.

183
00:11:18,052 --> 00:11:20,349
Oh yes,
jolly clever, this.

184
00:11:21,365 --> 00:11:23,017
"First you fill the bottle."

185
00:11:23,042 --> 00:11:24,790
"This gives you your quart."

186
00:11:24,815 --> 00:11:27,236
"Then you shove the cork in
and turn the bottle upside-down"

187
00:11:27,261 --> 00:11:30,140
"and you'll find that there's a sort of
bulging-in part at the bottom."

188
00:11:30,227 --> 00:11:32,368
"Well, slosh some whisky into that
and there you are."

189
00:11:32,393 --> 00:11:35,594
"Because the bottle is now holding more
than a quart, and you scoop the stakes."

190
00:11:38,761 --> 00:11:40,765
Oh you're not worried about
its not being accurate?

191
00:11:40,790 --> 00:11:42,415
Because I had it on
the highest authority

192
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:44,306
from an old boy called
Galahad Threepwood.

193
00:11:44,329 --> 00:11:46,414
Galahad Threepwood!

194
00:11:46,439 --> 00:11:47,728
Lord Emsworth's brother.

195
00:11:47,753 --> 00:11:49,303
Well I can tell you
Galahad Threepwood was a

196
00:11:49,328 --> 00:11:50,905
great man about the
metropolis at one time,

197
00:11:50,930 --> 00:11:52,164
and you can rely absolutely...

198
00:11:52,189 --> 00:11:55,127
What the devil do you mean,
you imbecile!

199
00:11:55,152 --> 00:11:58,171
Putting that tripe
in Tiny Tots!

200
00:11:58,337 --> 00:11:59,978
You don't like it?

201
00:12:00,517 --> 00:12:02,072
Wrong tone, do you think?

202
00:12:02,257 --> 00:12:04,309
Wrong tone!

203
00:12:04,530 --> 00:12:06,784
Mothers all over Britain

204
00:12:06,809 --> 00:12:10,481
are reading that balderdash
to their children!

205
00:12:10,869 --> 00:12:15,924
You probably cost us
10,000 subscribers.

206
00:12:15,949 --> 00:12:18,065
Yes, by Jove,
I see what you mean.

207
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:20,853
Could quite easily cause
alarm and despondency.

208
00:12:21,236 --> 00:12:22,689
Well I can only say
I'm sorry.

209
00:12:22,900 --> 00:12:24,666
You can only say you're sorry?

210
00:12:24,691 --> 00:12:27,901
You can get to blazes
out of my employ!

211
00:12:28,579 --> 00:12:30,150
Well that sounds like the sack.

212
00:12:30,251 --> 00:12:32,173
Don't tell me what you're
getting at is the sack?

213
00:12:32,198 --> 00:12:33,718
Out!

214
00:12:44,701 --> 00:12:46,802
Aren't you gone yet?!

215
00:12:47,011 --> 00:12:49,330
The fact is...that for
private and personal reasons

216
00:12:49,355 --> 00:12:51,651
I particularly wanted to
hold on to this job for a year.

217
00:12:52,989 --> 00:12:56,541
Have you met a girl called
Gertrude Butterwick?

218
00:12:58,015 --> 00:13:00,085
Won't bother you with
the whole story now, but

219
00:13:00,155 --> 00:13:03,189
unless I remain in your employment
until the middle of next June,

220
00:13:03,484 --> 00:13:05,862
my life will be a blank and
all my hopes and dreams

221
00:13:05,887 --> 00:13:07,519
GET OUT!!!

222
00:13:13,790 --> 00:13:15,142
Pip-pip.

223
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:19,571
He got it
from Galahad Threepwood.

224
00:13:21,251 --> 00:13:22,728
Well I'm not beaten yet.

225
00:13:24,368 --> 00:13:26,822
If Threepwood thinks he's safe in...

226
00:13:27,114 --> 00:13:28,934
Blandings Castle,

227
00:13:29,798 --> 00:13:33,064
he doesn't know
Lord Tilbury.

228
00:13:42,413 --> 00:13:43,553
Monty!

229
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:46,272
Hugo!
What brings you to these commercial parts?

230
00:13:46,296 --> 00:13:47,913
Chasing a job, old chap.

231
00:13:47,938 --> 00:13:50,044
- What brings you?
- Just been chased from one.

232
00:13:50,069 --> 00:13:51,427
You don't mean you
had a job?

233
00:13:51,452 --> 00:13:52,598
You're rolling in the stuff.

234
00:13:52,623 --> 00:13:55,576
That's got nothing to do with it.
There are wheels within wheels.

235
00:13:56,864 --> 00:13:58,818
I'm off to the Drones.

236
00:13:59,252 --> 00:14:01,182
- I'll join you.
- Good-o.

237
00:14:01,428 --> 00:14:03,169
Did I hear you were at Blandings?

238
00:14:03,202 --> 00:14:05,592
Yes, I was Lord Emsworth's secretary.

239
00:14:05,662 --> 00:14:07,519
- Been fired?
- Resigned.

240
00:14:07,544 --> 00:14:10,105
- On account of the swine.
- Milady Constance?

241
00:14:11,105 --> 00:14:13,011
Not exactly, no.

242
00:14:14,058 --> 00:14:15,480
I say...

243
00:14:15,774 --> 00:14:17,657
Hugo, when did
you leave Blandings?

244
00:14:17,681 --> 00:14:19,062
Couple of days ago?

245
00:14:19,087 --> 00:14:21,733
I wonder if Fate has just
tapped my shoulder?

246
00:14:21,758 --> 00:14:24,434
- You don't mean you're going to apply for the job?
- Well why shouldn't I?

247
00:14:24,459 --> 00:14:26,569
I'll telephone my Uncle Gregory,
get him to put in a word.

248
00:14:26,593 --> 00:14:29,960
Sir Gregory Parsloe?  Whoo hoo,
I'd forget about that, Monty.

249
00:14:29,988 --> 00:14:32,351
Well he and Emsworth are neighbors,
used to get on like a house on fire.

250
00:14:32,376 --> 00:14:34,031
Ah, how long since
you've been there?

251
00:14:34,056 --> 00:14:36,382
Few years, I suppose.
What's blown up since then?

252
00:14:36,407 --> 00:14:39,048
In one short and very
repellent word...

253
00:14:39,073 --> 00:14:40,079
pigs.

254
00:14:48,698 --> 00:14:50,729
- More, Sir Gregory?
- More?

255
00:14:50,754 --> 00:14:54,276
Oh yes, more.
Much, much more!

256
00:14:54,588 --> 00:14:57,353
Old Emsworth's in for
a shock this year.

257
00:14:57,592 --> 00:15:01,569
This year, that gold medal
will be mine.

258
00:15:06,895 --> 00:15:09,496
More, Pirbright, more!

259
00:15:09,521 --> 00:15:11,942
- Pardon, m'lud?
- More!

260
00:15:24,939 --> 00:15:26,579
Excuse me, milord?

261
00:15:27,976 --> 00:15:31,098
Lady Constance requests that
you would step up to the tree

262
00:15:31,123 --> 00:15:33,755
and have
a word, milord.

263
00:15:33,780 --> 00:15:35,677
- A word?
- Yes, milord.

264
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:36,973
What about?

265
00:15:36,998 --> 00:15:39,982
Her Ladyship did not
confide in me, milord.

266
00:15:42,372 --> 00:15:45,200
Have I done anything, Beach?

267
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:49,050
Not to my knowledge, milord.

268
00:16:05,877 --> 00:16:07,728
Now look at the bright side.

269
00:16:07,753 --> 00:16:11,578
I shall stand at the altar next to George
and pick up some tips when you and I get married.

270
00:16:11,601 --> 00:16:13,945
- If we ever do.
- Of course we will.

271
00:16:14,609 --> 00:16:16,554
Uncle Clarence has said
I can have the money.

272
00:16:16,579 --> 00:16:17,724
What can possibly go wrong?

273
00:16:17,749 --> 00:16:20,263
- I don't know, I just...
- Well then don't be so...

274
00:16:21,474 --> 00:16:22,521
you know...

275
00:16:22,732 --> 00:16:24,388
begins with an 'M'...
Mmm...

276
00:16:24,709 --> 00:16:26,324
Morbid.
Morbid!

277
00:16:26,349 --> 00:16:28,224
There's no need for it.

278
00:16:28,811 --> 00:16:30,280
Goodbye, Sue.

279
00:16:35,225 --> 00:16:36,787
Goodbye, Ronnie.

280
00:16:40,613 --> 00:16:43,192
Beg pardon.
On watch.

281
00:16:43,217 --> 00:16:45,270
His Lordship's orders.

282
00:16:50,763 --> 00:16:52,584
Why did he smile at you?

283
00:16:52,609 --> 00:16:55,459
- Oh, Ronnie!
- Sorry!  Sorry!

284
00:16:55,787 --> 00:16:57,638
I'm not jealous, I'm not!

285
00:16:59,005 --> 00:17:00,544
Ronnie.

286
00:17:03,909 --> 00:17:06,690
Oh, for goodness sake, Clarence!

287
00:17:06,715 --> 00:17:08,393
You're all pig!

288
00:17:08,417 --> 00:17:10,495
- What?
- Well look at you!

289
00:17:10,523 --> 00:17:12,601
And it's nearly lunchtime!

290
00:17:12,626 --> 00:17:13,765
Oh!

291
00:17:13,791 --> 00:17:16,346
You mean I should wash my hands.

292
00:17:16,374 --> 00:17:19,577
And your face.
And change your clothes.

293
00:17:19,602 --> 00:17:21,358
And your shoes!

294
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:25,335
You really are worse
than a baby, you know.

295
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:28,356
Goodbye Aunt Constance,
Uncle Clarence.

296
00:17:28,675 --> 00:17:31,784
- Goodbye, Ronnie dear.
- Goodbye.

297
00:17:38,686 --> 00:17:42,020
Very sweet, that Smith girl.

298
00:17:42,045 --> 00:17:44,436
Her name is Brown.

299
00:17:44,461 --> 00:17:46,599
I remember her mother.

300
00:17:47,185 --> 00:17:50,912
Galahad took me to the Tivoli
when she was singing there,

301
00:17:50,937 --> 00:17:53,402
little bit of a thing
in pink tights

302
00:17:53,427 --> 00:17:57,130
with the jolliest smile
you ever saw.

303
00:17:57,315 --> 00:17:58,987
How did her song go?

304
00:17:59,162 --> 00:18:04,701
Tum, tum,
tumpty tum.  Or,

305
00:18:04,797 --> 00:18:06,125
was it,

306
00:18:06,150 --> 00:18:10,712
Umpty dumpty,
tiddly pum?

307
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:13,389
Oh, never mind
how it went.

308
00:18:13,442 --> 00:18:16,076
The only thing I have to say
about Miss Brown's mother

309
00:18:16,101 --> 00:18:18,927
is that I wish she'd
never had a daughter.

310
00:18:19,139 --> 00:18:21,803
- Now Clarence,
- Yes, Connie.

311
00:18:21,996 --> 00:18:24,199
I have some good news for you.

312
00:18:24,840 --> 00:18:28,402
I had a telephone call this morning
from Sir Gregory Parsloe.

313
00:18:28,509 --> 00:18:30,931
The only possible good
news from Parsloe

314
00:18:30,955 --> 00:18:33,494
is that he has decided
to run up the white flag

315
00:18:33,519 --> 00:18:35,806
and admit the Empress
is champion pig.

316
00:18:36,462 --> 00:18:39,361
You are a perfect imbecile
about Sir Gregory.

317
00:18:39,462 --> 00:18:41,509
He rang, not about pigs,

318
00:18:41,618 --> 00:18:44,509
- but about his nephew.
- Nephew?  What nephew?

319
00:18:44,534 --> 00:18:46,569
- Young Montague Bodkin.
- Who?

320
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:49,163
- You remember him.
- No.

321
00:18:49,188 --> 00:18:52,249
- He was here often enough as a boy.
- Oh.

322
00:18:54,951 --> 00:18:58,022
Sir Gregory asked me,
as a personal favor,

323
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,574
to engage him as
your new secretary.

324
00:19:00,597 --> 00:19:02,605
Well I'm dashed,

325
00:19:02,630 --> 00:19:04,777
the nerve of the man!

326
00:19:04,802 --> 00:19:06,901
And I said I'd be delighted.

327
00:19:06,926 --> 00:19:09,299
- What?
- I said I'd be delighted.

328
00:19:09,324 --> 00:19:11,674
- You don't mean you've done it?
- Certainly!

329
00:19:11,699 --> 00:19:15,510
You're letting a nephew of Parsloe's
loose in Blandings Castle

330
00:19:15,535 --> 00:19:18,724
two weeks before
the Agricultural Show?

331
00:19:19,282 --> 00:19:21,131
He arrives tomorrow

332
00:19:21,156 --> 00:19:23,696
by the 2:45.

333
00:19:24,102 --> 00:19:25,844
Now...

334
00:19:27,021 --> 00:19:28,513
wash and brush up!

335
00:19:28,538 --> 00:19:30,240
It's time for lunch.

336
00:19:40,356 --> 00:19:42,284
Ah, Miss Brown.

337
00:19:42,309 --> 00:19:45,223
While Ronnie's away
you must make yourself at home.

338
00:19:45,248 --> 00:19:46,972
I believe,
in the servant's hall,

339
00:19:46,997 --> 00:19:49,736
there are some gramophone
records of music hall turns.

340
00:19:49,761 --> 00:19:52,687
I'm sure Beach would
allow you to borrow them.

341
00:19:58,986 --> 00:20:01,048
Oh yes, I remember
young Bodkin well.

342
00:20:01,073 --> 00:20:03,252
He's Parsloe's nephew.

343
00:20:03,277 --> 00:20:06,118
Well yes but, shouldn't have thought
the sort of fellow to nobble a pig.

344
00:20:06,143 --> 00:20:08,955
Well believe me,
I shall be watching him.

345
00:20:08,980 --> 00:20:11,728
Oh yes,
tell Pirbright to lurk as well,

346
00:20:11,868 --> 00:20:14,852
disguised as a tree
or a pail of potato-peel, eh?

347
00:20:14,877 --> 00:20:16,026
Clarence?

348
00:20:16,051 --> 00:20:19,298
I thought I told you to
wash and change for lunch!

349
00:20:20,348 --> 00:20:22,387
What a curse meals are!

350
00:20:22,412 --> 00:20:25,956
If people would only stick to drinking,
doctors would very soon be out of business.

351
00:20:25,981 --> 00:20:29,253
Did I ever tell you
about old Freddy Parson, the Hedgehog?

352
00:20:29,278 --> 00:20:30,823
Hedgehog?

353
00:20:30,848 --> 00:20:34,290
Freddy Parson lived almost entirely
on Scotch whisky.

354
00:20:34,315 --> 00:20:37,857
In the year '98, he was staying
with his brother Eustace, in France.

355
00:20:37,882 --> 00:20:39,474
Eustace was a teetotaler.

356
00:20:39,499 --> 00:20:41,405
He had a very lazy chef,

357
00:20:41,437 --> 00:20:45,093
who found a squashed hedgehog
and served it up for lunch.

358
00:20:45,577 --> 00:20:49,963
Eustace, the teetotaler, turned Nile-green
and was on the danger list for a week.

359
00:20:49,988 --> 00:20:53,449
Old Freddie, on the other hand,
being healthily pickled with alcohol,

360
00:20:54,074 --> 00:20:55,889
not only did he thrive on the dish,

361
00:20:55,914 --> 00:20:57,988
he had it served up cold the next day!

362
00:21:00,354 --> 00:21:01,854
Clarence!

363
00:21:07,549 --> 00:21:10,545
Monty Bodkin!  Monty Bodkin!

364
00:21:10,570 --> 00:21:14,335
No Bodkin shall
get the better of...ah!

365
00:21:14,703 --> 00:21:17,672
Hello, Miss Smith.
Excuse me.

366
00:21:17,697 --> 00:21:21,082
Must prepare for lunch.
My sister, you know.

367
00:21:21,107 --> 00:21:22,729
See you at the...

368
00:21:23,963 --> 00:21:25,877
in the...

369
00:21:27,065 --> 00:21:28,744
Hope so.

370
00:21:33,671 --> 00:21:35,710
- Gally.
- Sue, dear girl, join me.

371
00:21:35,735 --> 00:21:37,944
Did I hear the
name Monty Bodkin?

372
00:21:37,969 --> 00:21:40,148
Yes, Connie has engaged him
as Clarence's secretary.

373
00:21:40,170 --> 00:21:41,353
He's coming here tomorrow.

374
00:21:41,378 --> 00:21:43,253
Monty's coming here?

375
00:21:43,278 --> 00:21:44,709
Oh Gally, what a mess!

376
00:21:44,734 --> 00:21:46,112
My dear child,
what's the matter?

377
00:21:46,137 --> 00:21:49,022
Ronnie's the matter,
you know how jealous he gets.

378
00:21:49,047 --> 00:21:50,775
But where does Monty Bodkin
come into it?

379
00:21:50,800 --> 00:21:52,400
He'll drive Ronnie crazy.

380
00:21:52,425 --> 00:21:56,792
He'll come bouncing in and talk of old
times and probably kiss me on the cheek.

381
00:21:56,817 --> 00:21:59,688
And he'll let it all out.
That's Monty, he's bound to.

382
00:21:59,712 --> 00:22:02,954
Sue, my dear girl, I'm stuck in
the middle of a thick pea-souper.

383
00:22:02,979 --> 00:22:06,800
- Let what all out?
- That I used to be engaged to him.

384
00:22:06,964 --> 00:22:09,207
Ronnie will never
believe it's all over.

385
00:22:09,232 --> 00:22:10,964
Oh Gally, you know
what Ronnie's like.

386
00:22:10,989 --> 00:22:13,160
What am I going to do?

387
00:22:14,327 --> 00:22:15,718
Ah.

388
00:22:17,413 --> 00:22:19,561
Don't forget,
the 2:45.

389
00:22:19,757 --> 00:22:22,216
It'll get you back here
before Ronnie arrives from Norfolk.

390
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:24,983
No-one will ever know you've gone,
and Connie is lunching out today.

391
00:22:25,262 --> 00:22:28,447
Thank you Gally,
you do get wonderful ideas.

392
00:22:28,556 --> 00:22:32,049
Been in many a scrape myself. Don't fall
for young Monty all over again, will you?

393
00:22:32,231 --> 00:22:34,278
Don't be silly,
we're just like old friends.

394
00:22:34,304 --> 00:22:35,780
- Bye, Gally!
- Bye, dear girl!

395
00:22:35,805 --> 00:22:37,257
Bye!

396
00:23:20,395 --> 00:23:21,520
Yes?

397
00:23:22,150 --> 00:23:24,815
- Blandings Castle?
- Eh?

398
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:27,759
- Blandings Castle!
- You can't be.

399
00:23:27,783 --> 00:23:29,994
This is Blandings Castle.

400
00:23:30,019 --> 00:23:31,807
- What?
- Eh?

401
00:23:32,744 --> 00:23:36,713
May I speak with
the Honorable Galahad Threepwood?

402
00:23:36,738 --> 00:23:38,429
With Gally?

403
00:23:38,454 --> 00:23:41,538
May I speak with him?

404
00:23:41,563 --> 00:23:42,750
Yes.

405
00:23:42,775 --> 00:23:44,350
If you like.

406
00:23:44,375 --> 00:23:46,475
Don't have to ask me.

407
00:23:56,524 --> 00:23:59,243
You do see, don't you,
Monty darling?

408
00:23:59,268 --> 00:24:01,079
- "Monty darling"
- Monty!

409
00:24:01,102 --> 00:24:02,774
Don't worry Sue, when I
get down to Blandings

410
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:04,492
we'll be perfect strangers.
We must, I know.

411
00:24:04,517 --> 00:24:07,243
It seems so rotten,
deceiving Ronnie...

412
00:24:07,268 --> 00:24:10,250
Got to get used to that.
Secret of a happy and successful marriage.

413
00:24:10,641 --> 00:24:12,328
Isn't life rummy?

414
00:24:12,353 --> 00:24:14,406
Here are you and I, lunching
together like the dickens,

415
00:24:14,431 --> 00:24:15,953
just as if two years
had never passed.

416
00:24:15,978 --> 00:24:18,657
- Well they have passed.
- Oh, I know, I know, I know.

417
00:24:18,764 --> 00:24:21,248
And all the time you're planning
to get hitched to Ronnie Fish

418
00:24:21,273 --> 00:24:24,897
while I am heart and soul in favor of
an early union with Gertrude Butterwick.

419
00:24:25,028 --> 00:24:26,245
- What?
- Butterwick.

420
00:24:26,270 --> 00:24:29,934
- Butterwick. B for blister, U for ukulele,
- You mean you're engaged too?

421
00:24:29,959 --> 00:24:31,791
Well, sort of on appro.

422
00:24:31,816 --> 00:24:34,246
- You mean she can't make up her mind?
- Oh, she can, yes.

423
00:24:34,271 --> 00:24:36,504
- Her father can't.
- Why not?

424
00:24:37,441 --> 00:24:39,434
Well he's a very queer bird.

425
00:24:39,462 --> 00:24:42,322
The first thing he did when
I asked for his daughter's hand

426
00:24:42,395 --> 00:24:45,137
was to ask me
how I earned a living.

427
00:24:45,384 --> 00:24:47,548
- That must have been a bit of a shock.
- It was.

428
00:24:47,581 --> 00:24:49,991
And a still greater one when he went on
to add that the wedding bells

429
00:24:50,016 --> 00:24:51,937
would never ring out
unless I got a job

430
00:24:51,962 --> 00:24:53,593
 and held onto it for a year.

431
00:24:53,618 --> 00:24:56,593
Oh you poor lamb,
how perfectly awful!

432
00:24:56,618 --> 00:24:59,585
Ghastly!
I couldn't believe the fellow was serious.

433
00:24:59,663 --> 00:25:01,278
He was.

434
00:25:01,303 --> 00:25:04,874
Somehow I've got to scoop her in.
She's quite the angel, absolutely.

435
00:25:04,899 --> 00:25:07,453
Snag is, I've already
had one false start.

436
00:25:07,492 --> 00:25:10,500
I made rather a bloomer
in the Uncle Woggly department.

437
00:25:10,525 --> 00:25:13,360
So I've got to hold this
Blandings job for a year.

438
00:25:13,385 --> 00:25:15,536
Oh I think you'll be able to.

439
00:25:15,561 --> 00:25:17,427
- Do you really?
- Yes!

440
00:25:17,452 --> 00:25:18,952
I gather the old boy's gone porcine.

441
00:25:18,983 --> 00:25:21,880
I've been reading up about pigs;
I know all sorts of interesting facts by heart.

442
00:25:21,905 --> 00:25:24,428
Well then you'll have no trouble at all.

443
00:25:24,598 --> 00:25:27,012
Oh, you've cheered me up, young Sue.

444
00:25:27,037 --> 00:25:28,534
You always did.

445
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:31,020
You never fail to spot the bluebird.

446
00:25:52,774 --> 00:25:55,891
Look, I don't want to hurry you
but my sands are running out a bit.

447
00:25:56,001 --> 00:25:58,391
My train goes at 2:45, pip emma.

448
00:25:58,424 --> 00:26:00,203
You're going to Blandings today?

449
00:26:00,228 --> 00:26:02,337
- On the 2:45?
- That's right.

450
00:26:02,362 --> 00:26:05,487
- But I'm going back on the 2:45.
- Well that's fine, we'll travel together.

451
00:26:05,526 --> 00:26:07,815
- But we mustn't!
- Why not? Nobody's going to see us.

452
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:11,109
I must get back to the flat to pick up
some things.  We'll meet on the train.

453
00:26:11,135 --> 00:26:14,869
Pleasant chap to Market Blandings,
cold aloofness from there on.

454
00:26:14,926 --> 00:26:17,926
Waiter!
<i>L'addition!</i>

455
00:26:33,187 --> 00:26:34,913
Hello! Mr Bodkin!

456
00:26:39,788 --> 00:26:40,874
Lady Julia.

457
00:26:44,717 --> 00:26:46,256
Fancy running into you.

458
00:26:46,467 --> 00:26:48,944
- Didn't I hear you were in Biarritz?
- I was.

459
00:26:48,969 --> 00:26:51,905
I've come home.
Sit down, Mr Bodkin.

460
00:26:52,928 --> 00:26:54,920
Right.  Yes.

461
00:26:55,761 --> 00:26:56,941
Thank you.

462
00:26:57,420 --> 00:27:00,850
- So.  Where are you bound for, Mr Bodkin?
- What?

463
00:27:01,191 --> 00:27:03,559
Oh, um.
Market Blandings.

464
00:27:03,988 --> 00:27:05,945
Lord Emsworth's taking me on
as his secretary.

465
00:27:05,970 --> 00:27:09,462
Really?  I wasn't aware that
you were in need of a position.

466
00:27:09,487 --> 00:27:11,876
Oh, uh.
Wheels within wheels.

467
00:27:12,258 --> 00:27:14,321
Ah.  How cosy.

468
00:27:16,524 --> 00:27:18,766
I hear everything's much
the same at Blandings?

469
00:27:18,791 --> 00:27:21,410
Well, perhaps you consider
much the same to be

470
00:27:21,435 --> 00:27:23,938
an earthquake, an upheaval,
and a social cataclysm?

471
00:27:23,963 --> 00:27:25,529
I beg your pardon?

472
00:27:25,554 --> 00:27:28,203
My son is at Blandings,
and with him,

473
00:27:28,228 --> 00:27:30,311
a chorus-girl by
the name of Brown,

474
00:27:30,336 --> 00:27:32,203
who he proposes to marry.

475
00:27:32,664 --> 00:27:33,867
No.

476
00:27:33,892 --> 00:27:35,201
I assure you.

477
00:27:35,226 --> 00:27:36,484
A chorus-girl.

478
00:27:36,509 --> 00:27:39,566
Named Sue Brown.

479
00:27:40,482 --> 00:27:42,418
You don't know her by any chance?

480
00:27:42,443 --> 00:27:44,224
No.
Oh, no.  No.

481
00:27:45,746 --> 00:27:47,949
At least that simple name,
Sue Brown,

482
00:27:47,974 --> 00:27:50,658
doesn't sound like a girl who'd
bring a breach-of-promise action

483
00:27:50,683 --> 00:27:53,027
- when the thing is broken off.
- Broken off?

484
00:27:53,784 --> 00:27:55,330
Are you thinking of
breaking it off?

485
00:27:55,355 --> 00:27:57,089
Oh yes, of course.

486
00:27:58,509 --> 00:28:00,271
You seem very concerned.

487
00:28:00,296 --> 00:28:02,765
No, it just occurred to me,

488
00:28:02,790 --> 00:28:04,734
it might be a bit difficult,
I mean,

489
00:28:04,759 --> 00:28:06,704
Ronnie's a very determined sort of chap.

490
00:28:07,007 --> 00:28:09,569
He inherits it from his mother.
Ha ha!

491
00:28:14,054 --> 00:28:17,601
I should think, Ronnie must be enjoying it
at Blandings, Lady Julia.

492
00:28:18,485 --> 00:28:20,001
I beg your pardon?

493
00:28:20,026 --> 00:28:22,634
I say,
I hope your son, Ronnie,

494
00:28:22,659 --> 00:28:25,899
must be enjoying the green
countryside at Blandings.

495
00:28:26,743 --> 00:28:28,462
He likes it green.

496
00:28:30,898 --> 00:28:32,232
I beg your pardon,

497
00:28:32,257 --> 00:28:35,015
are you Lady Julia Fish?

498
00:28:35,040 --> 00:28:36,467
I am.

499
00:28:36,492 --> 00:28:39,069
My name's Sue Brown.

500
00:28:39,650 --> 00:28:43,158
Well, well, well.
Fancy that.

501
00:28:44,791 --> 00:28:47,033
Quite a coincidence, Mr Bodkin.

502
00:28:47,058 --> 00:28:49,127
Oh quite.
Most.

503
00:28:49,478 --> 00:28:51,650
We were just talking about you,
Miss Brown.

504
00:28:51,675 --> 00:28:54,520
And now, of course,
I recognize you.

505
00:28:54,896 --> 00:28:57,591
Ronald did send me a photograph.

506
00:28:57,958 --> 00:28:59,599
Charming.

507
00:29:00,315 --> 00:29:03,275
So, I'm losing a son
and gaining a daughter

508
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:06,175
- and you're the daughter, eh?
- Yes.

509
00:29:11,795 --> 00:29:15,436
You did tell me you had not
met Miss Brown?

510
00:29:15,461 --> 00:29:18,857
Definitely not. Certainly not.
Far from it. Not at all.

511
00:29:18,882 --> 00:29:22,357
Well you've met her now.
Mr Bodkin, Miss Brown.

512
00:29:24,816 --> 00:29:26,792
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

513
00:29:28,495 --> 00:29:31,667
Well, how very fortunate this is.

514
00:29:31,745 --> 00:29:34,792
Miss Brown, we have the journey

515
00:29:35,469 --> 00:29:39,062
for you to tell me
all about yourself.

516
00:29:41,311 --> 00:29:44,357
(noisily singing
Wedding March)

517
00:29:54,306 --> 00:29:56,204
There's something about a wedding.

518
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:58,023
Puts a man in a mood.

519
00:29:58,048 --> 00:30:00,563
A mood?
For what, sir?

520
00:30:00,588 --> 00:30:02,985
A wedding!

521
00:30:04,110 --> 00:30:05,165
Oh.

522
00:30:21,000 --> 00:30:22,094
Thank you, Voules.

523
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:28,258
Hello, Ronnie.

524
00:30:29,242 --> 00:30:30,946
Hello, mother.

525
00:30:33,504 --> 00:30:36,161
- I sort of thought you were in Biarritz.
- I was.

526
00:30:36,614 --> 00:30:37,723
But I'm back.

527
00:30:40,309 --> 00:30:42,692
Would you like to come
to the library for a little talk?

528
00:30:42,731 --> 00:30:44,567
Uh, mmm.

529
00:30:45,260 --> 00:30:47,073
Isn't it time I dressed for dinner?

530
00:30:47,324 --> 00:30:49,089
I think that can wait.

531
00:30:58,686 --> 00:31:00,389
I say.

532
00:31:00,460 --> 00:31:01,999
Lord Emsworth?

533
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:05,350
- Sorry I missed you when I arrived.
- You're not the bishop.

534
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:09,668
- No.
- I thought the bishop was coming to dinner.

535
00:31:09,723 --> 00:31:11,363
- Is he?
- Isn't he?

536
00:31:11,388 --> 00:31:13,299
- I don't know.
- Well I don't know.

537
00:31:13,324 --> 00:31:15,275
You'd better ask my sister.

538
00:31:21,735 --> 00:31:23,321
So.

539
00:31:23,543 --> 00:31:25,223
Who are you?

540
00:31:26,615 --> 00:31:28,348
I am Monty Bodkin, milord.

541
00:31:28,373 --> 00:31:30,232
- Bodkin?
- Your new secretary.

542
00:31:30,587 --> 00:31:31,985
Sir Gregory Parsloe's nephew.

543
00:31:32,010 --> 00:31:35,530
- Parsloe's nephew!  You're him.
- Oh yes.

544
00:31:35,555 --> 00:31:37,889
And may I say, milord,
how very glad I am to meet you.

545
00:31:37,914 --> 00:31:40,531
- You may not know what a passion I have for pigs.
- Ah!

546
00:31:40,641 --> 00:31:42,891
- For pigs!
- Oh yes indeed.

547
00:31:42,916 --> 00:31:46,709
- For many years, my favorite pages of the treausred EB...
- What?

548
00:31:46,973 --> 00:31:48,426
Encyclopaedia Brittanica...

549
00:31:48,451 --> 00:31:51,402
- have been those devoted to P-I-G.
- What?

550
00:31:52,529 --> 00:31:53,561
Pig.

551
00:31:53,945 --> 00:31:57,500
As I'm sure you're aware, there are
thirteen breeds of pig recognized in Britain,

552
00:31:57,524 --> 00:32:00,375
the most popular and generally useful
type is the Large White,

553
00:32:00,400 --> 00:32:03,059
which fattens readily, producing
an excellent bacon carcass.

554
00:32:03,084 --> 00:32:04,709
Carcass!

555
00:32:05,018 --> 00:32:06,756
Carcass!

556
00:32:07,763 --> 00:32:10,612
Carcass.
That's it, isn't it?

557
00:32:10,948 --> 00:32:11,995
Carcass?

558
00:32:12,276 --> 00:32:13,675
Car-cass!

559
00:32:14,511 --> 00:32:16,651
- Car-cass!
- Lord Emsworth?

560
00:32:17,144 --> 00:32:19,230
Car-cass!!!

561
00:32:26,598 --> 00:32:29,379
I'm sure the old EB said "carcass".

562
00:32:30,176 --> 00:32:33,191
Good evening, Mr Bodkin.
A most pleasant evening.

563
00:32:33,339 --> 00:32:35,932
Might take a little
fresh air before dinner.

564
00:32:42,742 --> 00:32:43,891
Mother!

565
00:32:43,916 --> 00:32:45,866
There are chorus-girls
and chorus-girls.

566
00:32:45,890 --> 00:32:48,672
When you get one like Sue,
there's a lot to be said for chorus-girls.

567
00:32:48,697 --> 00:32:50,140
No, Ronnie, there is not.

568
00:32:50,165 --> 00:32:52,008
They are all painted hussies.

569
00:32:52,033 --> 00:32:53,523
They've got to paint.

570
00:32:53,548 --> 00:32:55,148
Well they needn't huss!

571
00:32:55,663 --> 00:32:57,970
How are you going to trust a girl
who lives on excitement?

572
00:32:57,995 --> 00:32:59,361
Kicking up her beastly legs?

573
00:32:59,386 --> 00:33:01,545
Having affairs with
every man that takes her fancy?

574
00:33:01,570 --> 00:33:03,436
- Not Sue!
- Yes, Sue!

575
00:33:03,461 --> 00:33:05,574
- Wait till you meet her.
- I have met her, thanks.

576
00:33:05,599 --> 00:33:06,599
What?

577
00:33:06,624 --> 00:33:08,472
She was in the train
and introduced herself.

578
00:33:08,497 --> 00:33:09,747
The train?

579
00:33:09,772 --> 00:33:12,587
She was returning from London
on the train.

580
00:33:12,612 --> 00:33:15,276
- I didn't know she'd gone up to London.
- So I imagine.

581
00:33:15,301 --> 00:33:17,948
Then you would not have known
that she was lunching at the Berkeley

582
00:33:17,973 --> 00:33:19,753
with Monty Bodkin.

583
00:33:19,778 --> 00:33:21,283
Monty Bodkin!

584
00:33:22,783 --> 00:33:24,643
Lunching with Monty, and

585
00:33:24,674 --> 00:33:25,930
ogling Monty,

586
00:33:25,955 --> 00:33:28,307
and holding hands
with Monty.

587
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:30,254
And then when they
were in the train,

588
00:33:30,279 --> 00:33:32,969
they had the effrontery to pretend
they'd never met before!

589
00:33:32,994 --> 00:33:35,787
And now he's here as
your uncle's secretary.

590
00:33:35,812 --> 00:33:37,703
Well!  Why do you think that is, hmm?

591
00:33:38,214 --> 00:33:40,292
She put him up to it!

592
00:33:40,456 --> 00:33:43,778
- What?
- To be near her!  Oh!

593
00:33:43,803 --> 00:33:46,061
This girl is just like
all the rest of them.

594
00:33:46,086 --> 00:33:49,288
And Ronnie,
you're not a mental giant, I know.

595
00:33:49,313 --> 00:33:51,023
But if you can't see that,

596
00:33:51,048 --> 00:33:53,889
then you may certainly
need to be certified!

597
00:34:00,143 --> 00:34:02,307
- Constance?
- Julia!

598
00:34:02,332 --> 00:34:05,417
- How nice to have you home.
- Carcass.

599
00:34:05,442 --> 00:34:07,195
- Clarence?
- Carcass?

600
00:34:07,220 --> 00:34:08,590
Clarence, where are you going?

601
00:34:08,621 --> 00:34:12,270
Well, I thought,
I just thought...

602
00:34:12,295 --> 00:34:14,284
Not that pig!

603
00:34:14,309 --> 00:34:16,073
You're dressed for dinner.

604
00:34:16,098 --> 00:34:18,914
The Bishop is coming
and Sir Gregory Parsloe.

605
00:34:18,939 --> 00:34:21,588
Parsloe? You never mentioned Parsloe!

606
00:34:21,613 --> 00:34:24,252
Well of course I did,
you never listen to anything!

607
00:34:24,277 --> 00:34:26,242
- Parsloe!
- Clarence!  Clarence!

608
00:34:26,267 --> 00:34:28,610
Clarence, Clarence.

609
00:34:37,449 --> 00:34:38,632
What's that?

610
00:34:38,657 --> 00:34:40,152
A paper clip.

611
00:34:40,177 --> 00:34:41,715
A paper clip?

612
00:34:41,739 --> 00:34:43,535
- Where's your other stud?
- I lost it.

613
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:45,730
- Well you must have a spare.
- Of course I have.

614
00:34:45,755 --> 00:34:48,613
- Well where is it?
- I swallowed it.

615
00:34:49,435 --> 00:34:51,326
Well borrow one!

616
00:34:53,170 --> 00:34:55,037
- Connie!
- Connie.

617
00:34:57,654 --> 00:34:59,552
I need
to speak with you.

618
00:34:59,577 --> 00:35:01,045
Thank you Beach.

619
00:35:02,498 --> 00:35:03,701
Oh.

620
00:35:04,076 --> 00:35:05,740
- Beach.
- Yes, milord.

621
00:35:05,765 --> 00:35:09,099
Have you such a thing
as a spare paper clip?

622
00:35:09,513 --> 00:35:11,529
Paper...clip, milord?

623
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:14,029
I mean,
you know,

624
00:35:16,525 --> 00:35:19,345
Of course, milord,
I'll fetch it at once.

625
00:35:19,370 --> 00:35:23,533
Carcass! The little blighter called
the Empress a carcass!

626
00:35:23,558 --> 00:35:27,369
And Parsloe's coming to dinner
for Heaven's sake!

627
00:35:27,394 --> 00:35:30,243
What is it they say
about a man's castle?

628
00:35:30,478 --> 00:35:33,970
- They say his sisters rule it, I'm afraid.
- Eh?

629
00:35:35,077 --> 00:35:36,077
What?

630
00:35:36,102 --> 00:35:39,171
- And you agreed to this?
- I had to Julia.

631
00:35:39,196 --> 00:35:40,906
We both have to.

632
00:35:40,931 --> 00:35:42,366
I'm very sorry Connie,

633
00:35:42,391 --> 00:35:45,061
but I certainly do not intend
to buy Galahad off

634
00:35:45,086 --> 00:35:47,466
for the price of having Ronnie
marry any Miss Browns.

635
00:35:47,491 --> 00:35:50,046
You don't mean you're going to
try and stop this marriage?

636
00:35:50,071 --> 00:35:52,812
- I most certainly am.
- But Julia!

637
00:35:52,836 --> 00:35:56,047
This book will alienate
every friend we've got!

638
00:35:56,068 --> 00:35:58,943
They'll say we ought not to
have allowed him to publish it.

639
00:35:59,104 --> 00:36:01,447
Connie,
as far as I'm concerned,

640
00:36:01,472 --> 00:36:04,549
he can publish it until
he is blue in the face.

641
00:36:10,947 --> 00:36:12,478
Bodkin!

642
00:36:17,562 --> 00:36:19,569
Monty Bodkin!

643
00:36:31,267 --> 00:36:32,430
Gregory.

644
00:36:33,517 --> 00:36:34,775
A word.

645
00:36:35,007 --> 00:36:36,023
Ah.

646
00:36:38,572 --> 00:36:40,118
Oh Beach,

647
00:36:40,143 --> 00:36:42,906
I haven't seen Ronnie since
he came back, have you?

648
00:36:42,931 --> 00:36:44,553
Only briefly, miss.

649
00:36:44,578 --> 00:36:46,798
I believe he is still
changing for dinner.

650
00:36:46,823 --> 00:36:47,908
Oh.

651
00:36:49,057 --> 00:36:51,641
You don't know if he's spoken
to his mother, do you?

652
00:36:51,666 --> 00:36:54,376
I believe he has, miss.

653
00:36:54,401 --> 00:36:55,487
Oh.

654
00:36:56,562 --> 00:36:58,179
If I may say so, miss,

655
00:36:58,204 --> 00:37:01,062
I have known Mr Ronald
since he was a boy.

656
00:37:01,367 --> 00:37:05,195
Mr Ronald has always
had a mind of his own.

657
00:37:06,598 --> 00:37:08,957
Don't know what I'd do
without you, Beach.

658
00:37:10,035 --> 00:37:12,215
I'm-I'm very flattered, miss.

659
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:13,887
Have a cocktail.

660
00:37:14,301 --> 00:37:15,793
Thank you Beach.

661
00:37:18,337 --> 00:37:20,491
- Ah.
- Oh, hello Ronnie.

662
00:37:20,516 --> 00:37:22,150
Did the wedding go well?

663
00:37:23,221 --> 00:37:24,634
Yes, I think so.

664
00:37:25,353 --> 00:37:26,768
Yes, it went very well.

665
00:37:28,040 --> 00:37:30,141
- Thank you Beach.
- Sir.

666
00:37:43,122 --> 00:37:45,598
I heard you met my mother
on the train from London.

667
00:37:46,169 --> 00:37:48,934
Yes, I...popped up
to do some shopping.

668
00:37:50,496 --> 00:37:52,965
And on the train you also
met up with Monty Bodkin.

669
00:37:54,625 --> 00:37:57,984
Yes, Mr Bodkin was on the train.

670
00:37:59,078 --> 00:38:01,023
Nice chap, Monty.

671
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,320
- Known him for years.
- Oh, really?

672
00:38:06,153 --> 00:38:08,067
- Never met him before?
- No.

673
00:38:08,673 --> 00:38:09,782
No.

674
00:38:14,288 --> 00:38:15,733
Shall we join the others?

675
00:38:17,132 --> 00:38:18,265
Yes.

676
00:38:36,975 --> 00:38:39,756
- She can't stop the marriage.
- She will.

677
00:38:39,781 --> 00:38:42,637
I know Julia,
she's entirely self-centered.

678
00:38:42,662 --> 00:38:45,217
- And he'll publish the book.
- Oh yes.

679
00:38:45,242 --> 00:38:47,340
I know Galahad,
he will.

680
00:38:47,365 --> 00:38:49,544
But they'll never
adopt me as candidate.

681
00:38:49,569 --> 00:38:51,341
Not a man with a past.

682
00:38:51,366 --> 00:38:52,451
Never!

683
00:38:52,476 --> 00:38:55,507
As a Conservative and Unionist!

684
00:38:55,814 --> 00:38:57,095
Shhh.

685
00:38:59,027 --> 00:39:00,082
Who's that?

686
00:39:00,107 --> 00:39:01,295
Pilbeam.

687
00:39:01,894 --> 00:39:03,058
Pilbeam?

688
00:39:03,720 --> 00:39:05,296
The private investigator?

689
00:39:05,321 --> 00:39:08,413
- Do you know him?
- Yes. Well, sort of.

690
00:39:08,438 --> 00:39:10,478
- I employed him once.
- What for?

691
00:39:10,678 --> 00:39:12,795
Oh, a delicate matter.

692
00:39:12,820 --> 00:39:14,248
Some letters.

693
00:39:14,273 --> 00:39:16,305
Perfectly innocent, you understand,

694
00:39:16,330 --> 00:39:18,543
but the wrong construction
might have been...

695
00:39:18,568 --> 00:39:21,377
Well anyway,
he retrieved them for me.

696
00:39:21,402 --> 00:39:23,378
Very clever chap.

697
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:24,988
Really?

698
00:39:25,656 --> 00:39:27,083
I say,

699
00:39:27,108 --> 00:39:30,216
how many copies
of this manuscript?

700
00:39:30,241 --> 00:39:31,779
Only one.

701
00:39:31,804 --> 00:39:34,021
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

702
00:39:34,046 --> 00:39:36,482
He's never really finished
the horrible thing.

703
00:39:36,507 --> 00:39:38,380
He keeps it in his desk

704
00:39:38,405 --> 00:39:40,206
and takes it out

705
00:39:40,231 --> 00:39:41,917
and adds bits to it.

706
00:39:41,942 --> 00:39:44,317
In his desk?

707
00:39:44,342 --> 00:39:46,927
Should be child's play
for Pilbeam.

708
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:48,903
I dare say,

709
00:39:48,928 --> 00:39:50,954
if I offer him

710
00:39:50,979 --> 00:39:52,604
500 pounds.

711
00:40:40,228 --> 00:40:41,283
I say.

712
00:40:42,492 --> 00:40:43,587
Lord Emsworth?

713
00:40:45,672 --> 00:40:47,017
Good morning, milord.

714
00:40:47,978 --> 00:40:49,811
Eh?
Oh.

715
00:40:49,913 --> 00:40:51,273
It's you.

716
00:40:51,610 --> 00:40:52,696
Right.

717
00:40:53,655 --> 00:40:54,804
I was wondering, your Lordship,

718
00:40:54,829 --> 00:40:57,108
if there's anything
you'd like me to do.

719
00:40:57,773 --> 00:40:59,218
Like, I suppose,

720
00:40:59,554 --> 00:41:00,663
secretarying.

721
00:41:00,966 --> 00:41:02,107
No!

722
00:41:03,235 --> 00:41:04,274
Oh.

723
00:41:04,646 --> 00:41:05,825
Hurr!

724
00:41:07,888 --> 00:41:09,450
- Hurr!
- Just visiting!

725
00:41:39,747 --> 00:41:41,208
I say,

726
00:41:41,233 --> 00:41:43,053
that's a ripping chapter.

727
00:42:07,661 --> 00:42:09,092
Excuse me my man.

728
00:42:09,123 --> 00:42:10,537
How do I get to the Castle?

729
00:42:11,404 --> 00:42:13,404
However you choose, sir.

730
00:42:13,717 --> 00:42:15,138
However you choose.

731
00:42:17,215 --> 00:42:18,465
(mumbles) One-six-four.

732
00:42:22,926 --> 00:42:23,973
Ronnie.

733
00:42:24,543 --> 00:42:25,884
I say, Ronnie?

734
00:42:26,611 --> 00:42:28,346
- I was just coming to see you.
- Oh really?

735
00:42:28,371 --> 00:42:30,150
Want your advice, old chap.

736
00:42:30,361 --> 00:42:33,860
I came here as your uncle's secretary
but he won't give me anything to do.

737
00:42:33,885 --> 00:42:36,078
Just eyes me as if I
ought to be in Sing-Sing.

738
00:42:36,103 --> 00:42:38,414
Already I fear
the Order of the Boot.

739
00:42:38,711 --> 00:42:40,857
Any ideas as to what I could do to
try and warm him up a bit?

740
00:42:40,882 --> 00:42:42,570
Sorry Monty, no.

741
00:42:42,758 --> 00:42:44,539
You'll have to excuse me,
I'm going out.

742
00:42:52,697 --> 00:42:54,221
Hello!

743
00:42:54,346 --> 00:42:56,088
Ah. Hello.

744
00:42:56,361 --> 00:42:58,252
Do you want to go for a walk?

745
00:42:58,463 --> 00:42:59,963
Going shopping.

746
00:43:00,405 --> 00:43:01,639
With Mother.

747
00:43:04,195 --> 00:43:05,734
Hello, Miss Brown.

748
00:43:06,117 --> 00:43:07,156
Hello.

749
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:30,356
I hate
all of Shropshire.

750
00:44:21,588 --> 00:44:25,166
Is Mr Threepwood in?
Mr Galahad Threepwood?

751
00:44:25,305 --> 00:44:27,038
Mr Galahad, sir?

752
00:44:28,031 --> 00:44:29,834
What name shall I say?

753
00:44:29,859 --> 00:44:32,164
Lord Tilbury.

754
00:44:32,497 --> 00:44:34,768
Very good, milord,
if you will step this way

755
00:44:34,793 --> 00:44:37,988
I fancy Mr Galahad
is in the nursery.

756
00:44:53,410 --> 00:44:55,293
Just along here, milord.

757
00:45:06,203 --> 00:45:08,192
He, ah, must have stepped out, milord.

758
00:45:08,217 --> 00:45:11,514
If you'll wait in here
I will endeavor to find him for you.

759
00:45:11,889 --> 00:45:12,943
Thank you.

760
00:45:45,123 --> 00:45:46,162
Aha!

761
00:45:47,248 --> 00:45:48,255
Oh.

762
00:45:48,959 --> 00:45:50,646
I know you, don't I?

763
00:45:50,668 --> 00:45:52,626
No, don't tell me,
let me think.

764
00:45:52,651 --> 00:45:54,018
Now, you're fatter

765
00:45:54,043 --> 00:45:55,495
and you've aged

766
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:56,604
a lot.

767
00:45:56,629 --> 00:45:58,526
But you're someone
I used to know.

768
00:45:58,551 --> 00:45:59,808
Now let me think.

769
00:45:59,833 --> 00:46:01,981
Shorty Smith!
No.

770
00:46:02,006 --> 00:46:04,361
Stumpy Whitey!
Nope.

771
00:46:04,386 --> 00:46:06,338
I've got it,
by gad.

772
00:46:06,363 --> 00:46:08,197
Stinker Pyke!

773
00:46:08,221 --> 00:46:10,900
Pyke! That's who you are,
and we used to call you Stinker!

774
00:46:12,616 --> 00:46:14,772
Well, well,
how are you, Stinker?

775
00:46:14,945 --> 00:46:17,961
I would rather you refrained
from using that name.

776
00:46:18,149 --> 00:46:20,609
I can't pretend I ever
cared for it.

777
00:46:20,858 --> 00:46:22,741
Well, all right.
Pyke then.

778
00:46:23,826 --> 00:46:27,576
The last time I saw you
must have been that night in Romano's

779
00:46:27,601 --> 00:46:30,530
when Plug Basham started
throwing bread about,

780
00:46:30,555 --> 00:46:32,248
became rather over-excited,

781
00:46:32,273 --> 00:46:34,498
and suddenly,
there you were, on the floor,

782
00:46:34,523 --> 00:46:37,045
laid out cold by a dashed
great side of beef!

783
00:46:38,364 --> 00:46:40,442
I can see your face now,
most amusing.

784
00:46:40,467 --> 00:46:42,747
- I really don't wish to...
- Poor old Plug

785
00:46:42,779 --> 00:46:44,558
a fellow who never
knew where to stop.

786
00:46:44,606 --> 00:46:46,739
- Er, Threepwood, I've come...
- I took the whole thing up with him

787
00:46:46,764 --> 00:46:48,389
and he swore he'd never
touch another drop.

788
00:46:48,414 --> 00:46:50,847
About two weeks later,
I met him in the Strand.

789
00:46:50,872 --> 00:46:52,761
"It's all right
Gally, I've done it."

790
00:46:52,786 --> 00:46:54,590
"I've won the battle," he said.

791
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:58,544
"Splendid fellow!
Was it a terrific strain?"

792
00:46:58,569 --> 00:46:59,856
"It was at first," he said.

793
00:46:59,881 --> 00:47:02,785
"In fact I didn't think I'd be able
to stick it out.  Then suddenly,"

794
00:47:02,810 --> 00:47:04,489
"I discovered a teetotal drink"

795
00:47:04,514 --> 00:47:06,933
"which was not only palatable,
but appetizing."

796
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:08,792
- Absinthe, they call it."
- Absinthe!

797
00:47:08,817 --> 00:47:11,503
"And now I've got that, I don't care
if I never have another drink."

798
00:47:11,528 --> 00:47:15,557
I'm not interested
in your friend Basham.

799
00:47:15,582 --> 00:47:16,875
I'm sorry.

800
00:47:16,900 --> 00:47:18,916
You've come on some
most important errand,

801
00:47:18,941 --> 00:47:21,229
and I'm yarning away,
wasting your time.

802
00:47:21,580 --> 00:47:22,790
Take a seat.

803
00:47:24,913 --> 00:47:27,312
And tell me why you've
bobbed up again, Stinker.

804
00:47:27,450 --> 00:47:29,622
- Don't call me Stinker.
- Sorry, I forgot.

805
00:47:29,647 --> 00:47:33,551
- Now, well, carry on Pyke.
- And don't call me Pyke.

806
00:47:35,348 --> 00:47:36,692
My name

807
00:47:37,434 --> 00:47:39,168
is Tilbury.

808
00:47:39,403 --> 00:47:41,535
Going about under a false name,
I don't like that.

809
00:47:41,939 --> 00:47:42,947
It never fails,

810
00:47:42,972 --> 00:47:46,767
sooner or later you're bound to be found out,
and then you get it all the hotter from the judge.

811
00:47:46,792 --> 00:47:50,221
I remember saying that to Stiffy Vokes
when he was sneaking about London

812
00:47:50,246 --> 00:47:52,039
calling himself Orlando Maltravers.

813
00:47:52,064 --> 00:47:54,391
I call myself Tilbury

814
00:47:54,415 --> 00:47:57,069
because in a recent Honours List

815
00:47:57,094 --> 00:47:58,852
I received a peerage,

816
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:02,183
and Tilbury is the
title I selected.

817
00:48:02,208 --> 00:48:04,107
Oh, you're <i>Lord</i> Tilbury?

818
00:48:04,132 --> 00:48:05,321
I am.

819
00:48:05,346 --> 00:48:07,925
What on earth did they make
you a lord for, Stinker?

820
00:48:08,901 --> 00:48:11,518
I happen to be the
proprietor of a concern

821
00:48:11,543 --> 00:48:14,120
whose name may be
familiar to you--

822
00:48:14,361 --> 00:48:17,346
The Mammoth Publishing Company.

823
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:19,111
- Mammoth?
- Mammoth.

824
00:48:19,361 --> 00:48:21,306
Aren't Mammoth the people
I sold that book of mine to?

825
00:48:21,331 --> 00:48:22,471
They are.

826
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:24,165
Stinker.

827
00:48:24,368 --> 00:48:25,501
I mean Pyke.

828
00:48:25,526 --> 00:48:26,713
I mean Tilbury.

829
00:48:27,135 --> 00:48:28,331
I'm sorry about that.

830
00:48:28,570 --> 00:48:29,797
Let you down,
haven't I?

831
00:48:29,859 --> 00:48:31,203
I see now
why you've come.

832
00:48:31,281 --> 00:48:32,648
You want me
to reconsider.

833
00:48:32,673 --> 00:48:34,168
Well I'm afraid you've had
your journey for nothing.

834
00:48:34,193 --> 00:48:35,801
I will not let
that book be published.

835
00:48:35,826 --> 00:48:36,927
Good heavens!

836
00:48:36,952 --> 00:48:38,505
I can't argue,
I wont do it.

837
00:48:38,530 --> 00:48:40,294
- I have reasons.
- Reasons?

838
00:48:40,334 --> 00:48:42,418
Private and...
sentimental reasons.

839
00:48:42,895 --> 00:48:44,622
It's outrageous!

840
00:48:45,270 --> 00:48:47,997
You've signed...a contract!

841
00:48:48,752 --> 00:48:49,820
And you can't pretend

842
00:48:49,845 --> 00:48:52,251
that you're not in a position
to deliver the book. It's here,

843
00:48:52,276 --> 00:48:53,776
on your desk,

844
00:48:53,801 --> 00:48:55,276
finished.

845
00:48:55,768 --> 00:48:58,439
A book like that
is never finished.

846
00:49:04,402 --> 00:49:06,659
I could add,
and refine,

847
00:49:06,684 --> 00:49:08,488
for the rest of my life.

848
00:49:08,894 --> 00:49:09,901
Now then,

849
00:49:10,652 --> 00:49:11,657
for example,

850
00:49:11,757 --> 00:49:14,467
I see here, I describe
old Parsloe as,

851
00:49:14,592 --> 00:49:16,350
"intoxicated".

852
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:18,921
Not colorful enough!

853
00:49:20,942 --> 00:49:22,325
He was

854
00:49:22,350 --> 00:49:23,684
um

855
00:49:23,825 --> 00:49:25,208
ah

856
00:49:26,317 --> 00:49:27,598
uh

857
00:49:27,965 --> 00:49:29,223
er

858
00:49:29,666 --> 00:49:31,158
pickled at the gills!

859
00:49:31,486 --> 00:49:33,447
Oh
Threepwood

860
00:49:33,472 --> 00:49:35,291
that is

861
00:49:35,316 --> 00:49:36,566
masterly.

862
00:49:37,213 --> 00:49:38,291
I...

863
00:49:38,330 --> 00:49:39,330
I

864
00:49:39,355 --> 00:49:40,510
beg you,

865
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:43,734
on behalf of
the English language...

866
00:49:43,759 --> 00:49:46,306
Yes, yes.

867
00:49:48,408 --> 00:49:49,884
I'm sorry it
can't be done.

868
00:49:50,056 --> 00:49:51,228
A masterpiece,

869
00:49:51,392 --> 00:49:52,399
but it can't be done.

870
00:49:56,437 --> 00:49:57,444
Please?

871
00:49:57,469 --> 00:49:59,008
Stinker, that's final.

872
00:50:00,109 --> 00:50:01,718
Don't call me Stinker.

873
00:50:01,743 --> 00:50:03,085
I will not publish.

874
00:50:03,110 --> 00:50:04,218
Awfully sorry, Stinker.

875
00:50:12,044 --> 00:50:14,950
Are you sure I cannot
order you a taxi, milord?

876
00:50:15,153 --> 00:50:16,544
I'll walk.

877
00:50:17,432 --> 00:50:18,510
Pig.

878
00:50:19,827 --> 00:50:21,592
Beg your pardon, milord?

879
00:50:22,006 --> 00:50:23,092
I...

880
00:50:23,241 --> 00:50:24,356
smell...

881
00:50:24,381 --> 00:50:25,677
pig.

882
00:50:25,848 --> 00:50:29,286
Ah yes, that would be
the Empress of Blandings, milord.

883
00:50:29,427 --> 00:50:31,411
The finest pig
in the county.

884
00:50:31,879 --> 00:50:34,786
I love pigs!

885
00:50:46,735 --> 00:50:48,305
What a pig!

886
00:51:09,092 --> 00:51:10,725
Excuse me, milord.

887
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:14,867
Milord?

888
00:51:18,993 --> 00:51:21,680
The Empress has been
attacked, milord.

889
00:51:21,705 --> 00:51:22,978
What?

890
00:51:27,771 --> 00:51:29,442
Let me out!

891
00:51:29,467 --> 00:51:30,779
Help!

892
00:51:30,804 --> 00:51:33,154
Somebody let me
out of here!

893
00:51:33,179 --> 00:51:34,904
Hello!

894
00:51:36,248 --> 00:51:38,896
You lad, you!
Let me out!

895
00:51:38,921 --> 00:51:40,622
I say, that isn't Lord
Tilbury by any chance?

896
00:51:40,647 --> 00:51:42,469
Well of course it's Lord
Tilbury, who the devil are you?

897
00:51:42,494 --> 00:51:43,980
Bodkin. M Monty Bodkin.

898
00:51:44,005 --> 00:51:45,294
- M Monty...
- Bodkin.

899
00:51:45,319 --> 00:51:47,059
- Bodkin?
- You remember old Monty.

900
00:51:47,084 --> 00:51:49,183
- What are you doing in there?
- Well somebody locked me in!

901
00:51:49,208 --> 00:51:51,387
- Let me out, you blithering idiot!
- Right ho.

902
00:51:51,412 --> 00:51:53,855
- And don't say "right-ho"!
- Right-ho.

903
00:51:57,183 --> 00:51:58,988
- Takes a bit of shifting.

904
00:52:00,994 --> 00:52:03,307
Out you pop.
I say, how did you get in there?

905
00:52:03,332 --> 00:52:05,533
- Somebody locked me in.
- Who would want to do that?

906
00:52:05,558 --> 00:52:07,292
Well I don't know,
I was standing over there,

907
00:52:07,317 --> 00:52:09,369
 feeding a
potato to the pig.

908
00:52:09,394 --> 00:52:10,913
You gave a spud to the porker?

909
00:52:10,938 --> 00:52:12,345
You'll be hung, drawn,
and quartered

910
00:52:12,370 --> 00:52:14,454
Old Emsworth will think you
were trying to poison it.

911
00:52:15,016 --> 00:52:16,907
Where is he?

912
00:52:17,172 --> 00:52:18,805
This way, m'lud.

913
00:52:19,001 --> 00:52:20,758
- Oh my God.
- Come on.

914
00:52:21,071 --> 00:52:24,094
Parsloe's man,
it must be.

915
00:52:24,119 --> 00:52:26,404
Take the birch to him!

916
00:52:26,429 --> 00:52:27,625
The lash!

917
00:52:27,650 --> 00:52:29,498
The cat o' nine...

918
00:52:29,523 --> 00:52:31,470
- whatever it is!
- Tails, milord.

919
00:52:31,495 --> 00:52:32,963
'E gone, milord!

920
00:52:32,988 --> 00:52:35,119
You numbskull!

921
00:52:35,144 --> 00:52:38,999
- Pirbright, you didn't lock it!
- I did milord, I did!

922
00:52:39,024 --> 00:52:41,069
Perhaps someone let him out, milord.

923
00:52:41,094 --> 00:52:43,123
- I'll birch the man who did.
- Ooh!

924
00:52:43,148 --> 00:52:44,522
- I'll lash him!
- Huh!

925
00:52:44,554 --> 00:52:45,709
I'll cat o'...

926
00:52:46,028 --> 00:52:47,247
cat o'...

927
00:52:47,669 --> 00:52:50,232
- Nine tails, milord.
- Nine?

928
00:52:51,014 --> 00:52:52,670
Nine and more!

929
00:52:53,965 --> 00:52:56,371
Many, many, more!

930
00:53:01,189 --> 00:53:02,580
Up here, milord?

931
00:53:05,494 --> 00:53:06,893
Not a trace, milord.

932
00:53:11,714 --> 00:53:13,409
What the devil are you
doing here, Bodkin?

933
00:53:13,847 --> 00:53:15,238
I'm Lord Emsworth's secretary.

934
00:53:15,263 --> 00:53:18,081
- Secretary?
- 24 hours after your slinging me out.

935
00:53:18,106 --> 00:53:20,238
A good man isn't long
getting snapped up.

936
00:53:20,710 --> 00:53:21,944
You mean you're

937
00:53:22,225 --> 00:53:23,858
living at the Castle?

938
00:53:24,077 --> 00:53:25,295
For the nonce I am.

939
00:53:25,651 --> 00:53:27,940
I don't mind telling you
I expect to shake up shortly.

940
00:53:28,096 --> 00:53:29,711
So if you're feeling
that we might

941
00:53:29,736 --> 00:53:32,078
make a fresh start,
let the dead past

942
00:53:32,538 --> 00:53:35,390
bury it's dead, and take me back
into the fold, I could report for duty

943
00:53:35,641 --> 00:53:36,930
almost immediately.

944
00:53:37,328 --> 00:53:40,938
- You wish to return to my employ?
- Definitely.

945
00:53:41,076 --> 00:53:43,584
- For a year, if possible.
- A year.

946
00:53:43,963 --> 00:53:45,424
Or twelve months.

947
00:53:46,989 --> 00:53:48,576
- You shall.
- Good egg.

948
00:53:48,601 --> 00:53:50,932
- Provided...
- Oh golly, is there a catch?

949
00:53:55,924 --> 00:53:58,448
Let's try over here.

950
00:53:59,890 --> 00:54:01,413
Oh my God.

951
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:02,992
Come on!

952
00:54:04,242 --> 00:54:05,515
What's the catch?

953
00:54:05,672 --> 00:54:07,148
Galahad Threepwood

954
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:10,794
has a manuscript;
I intend to take possession of it.

955
00:54:10,819 --> 00:54:11,936
D'you mean pinch it?

956
00:54:12,030 --> 00:54:13,866
Crudely, yes.

957
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:15,124
How?

958
00:54:15,265 --> 00:54:18,811
With the assistance of
somebody living in the Castle.

959
00:54:19,239 --> 00:54:21,278
Let's try the ditch.

960
00:54:24,075 --> 00:54:26,099
Excellent lurking place, milord.

961
00:54:26,124 --> 00:54:27,682
You want me to pinch it?

962
00:54:27,707 --> 00:54:29,229
Precisely!

963
00:54:29,254 --> 00:54:30,823
Lord love a duck!

964
00:55:06,298 --> 00:55:08,001
Heavy weather, sir.

965
00:55:18,359 --> 00:55:19,929
I fear a storm.

966
00:55:32,496 --> 00:55:35,338
Are you sure he was
trying to steal the thing?

967
00:55:35,363 --> 00:55:38,520
The papers were actually
in his grasp, sir.

968
00:55:38,545 --> 00:55:40,895
He couldn't have been looking
for note-paper, or something?

969
00:55:41,879 --> 00:55:43,027
No, sir.

970
00:55:43,052 --> 00:55:45,328
But what possible motive
could the little perisher have

971
00:55:45,353 --> 00:55:47,407
for wanting to steal my book?

972
00:55:47,432 --> 00:55:49,477
When Sir Gregory came
to dinner, sir,

973
00:55:49,502 --> 00:55:52,494
I observed him talking
to Mr Pilbeam

974
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:54,604
in a secluded
corner of the hall.

975
00:55:54,924 --> 00:55:56,432
Mr Pilbeam

976
00:55:56,457 --> 00:55:58,394
is a private investigator.

977
00:55:59,786 --> 00:56:01,099
Give me the low-down
then, Beach.

978
00:56:01,124 --> 00:56:04,084
The motive, the method,
and who done what.

979
00:56:11,339 --> 00:56:12,487
Tonight.

980
00:56:16,584 --> 00:56:18,092
I...

981
00:56:18,334 --> 00:56:19,678
Tonight!

982
00:56:24,824 --> 00:56:26,824
I see, Beach, I see.

983
00:56:26,849 --> 00:56:28,051
They're in it together, eh?

984
00:56:28,076 --> 00:56:30,121
And Pilbeam's their factotum!

985
00:56:30,144 --> 00:56:32,173
Sherlock himself would have to
give you best, Beach.

986
00:56:32,198 --> 00:56:33,729
Very kind of you
to say so, sir.

987
00:56:33,754 --> 00:56:36,025
Well as Robbie Burns said,

988
00:56:36,050 --> 00:56:39,728
"The best-laid schemes of mice and men
gang aft agley."

989
00:56:39,753 --> 00:56:43,275
"And they wee tim'rous beasties
can whistle for their cheese."

990
00:56:43,894 --> 00:56:45,683
- Quite, sir.
- All we have to do

991
00:56:45,708 --> 00:56:47,619
is to ensure the safety
of the manuscript.

992
00:56:47,644 --> 00:56:50,032
I've got it.
You must take it, Beach.

993
00:56:50,057 --> 00:56:51,688
- Me, sir?
- Of course!

994
00:56:51,713 --> 00:56:53,482
- But Mr Galahad,
- What?

995
00:56:53,507 --> 00:56:57,529
suppose Her Ladyship discovered I had it
and requested me to hand it to her?

996
00:56:57,554 --> 00:57:00,132
You're not afraid of
Lady Constance, are you Beach?

997
00:57:00,157 --> 00:57:01,747
Yes, I am sir.

998
00:57:01,772 --> 00:57:03,315
But how is she to know?

999
00:57:03,340 --> 00:57:05,511
She doesn't drop into your pantry
for a chat, does she?

1000
00:57:05,536 --> 00:57:06,761
Certainly not, sir.

1001
00:57:06,786 --> 00:57:08,909
And at night you must sleep
with it under your pillow.

1002
00:57:08,934 --> 00:57:11,600
No risk of her coming to tuck you
up in bed or anything, is there?

1003
00:57:12,377 --> 00:57:14,354
No arguments, Beach.
Take it.

1004
00:57:14,993 --> 00:57:16,071
Be a man.

1005
00:57:38,866 --> 00:57:42,428
PIR-BRIGHT!

1006
00:57:46,731 --> 00:57:48,919
- Excuse me!
- Oh I say, Beach. Sorry.

1007
00:57:48,944 --> 00:57:50,341
Dashed stupid of me.

1008
00:57:50,744 --> 00:57:52,087
Really, I'm most dreadfully...

1009
00:57:52,543 --> 00:57:53,376
Oh.

1010
00:57:54,136 --> 00:57:55,408
Oh I say, Beach...

1011
00:57:55,433 --> 00:57:58,879
Please do not worry yourself sir,
I'm sure the fault was mine.

1012
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:00,268
Shall I take that, sir?

1013
00:58:00,293 --> 00:58:02,962
I say Beach, isn't this
that new book of Mr Galahad's?

1014
00:58:03,275 --> 00:58:04,384
Is it, sir?

1015
00:58:04,689 --> 00:58:07,181
Well you can see it is,
I mean...

1016
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:11,691
Pretty good that,
I should imagine.

1017
00:58:11,716 --> 00:58:13,590
Thing I'd very much
like to read.

1018
00:58:13,615 --> 00:58:15,261
Couldn't lend it to me, I suppose?

1019
00:58:15,286 --> 00:58:16,629
No sir.

1020
00:58:16,654 --> 00:58:17,676
No.

1021
00:58:17,701 --> 00:58:19,082
No sir.

1022
00:58:19,107 --> 00:58:20,379
You won't?

1023
00:58:20,404 --> 00:58:21,728
No sir.

1024
00:58:21,753 --> 00:58:24,200
I'd give a good deal
to read that thing, Beach.

1025
00:58:24,225 --> 00:58:25,350
Indeed, sir?

1026
00:58:25,375 --> 00:58:26,689
Ten quid, in fact.

1027
00:58:26,714 --> 00:58:28,150
Indeed, sir?

1028
00:58:28,175 --> 00:58:29,824
Or rather, twenty.

1029
00:58:30,727 --> 00:58:32,954
- Indeed, sir?
- And when I say twenty,

1030
00:58:32,979 --> 00:58:35,634
I mean, of course,
twenty-five.

1031
00:58:36,172 --> 00:58:37,827
I regret to say, sir,

1032
00:58:37,852 --> 00:58:41,328
I am not in a position
to fall in with your wishes.

1033
00:58:53,281 --> 00:58:54,453
What ho, Pilbeam.

1034
00:58:55,720 --> 00:58:56,984
Bodkin.

1035
00:59:07,767 --> 00:59:09,119
I say, Pilbeam.

1036
00:59:12,095 --> 00:59:13,759
You're a...a...

1037
00:59:14,580 --> 00:59:16,314
whatchamacallit, aren't you?

1038
00:59:16,339 --> 00:59:17,687
Private Eye.

1039
00:59:17,984 --> 00:59:20,702
I'm an investigator,
Mr Bodkin.

1040
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:23,406
Topping.

1041
00:59:24,218 --> 00:59:26,312
You in the mood for a
bit of the stealthy stuff?

1042
00:59:26,458 --> 00:59:30,122
You wish to make use of
my professional services?

1043
00:59:30,246 --> 00:59:31,340
Yes.

1044
00:59:31,942 --> 00:59:34,106
It's about that book
of Gally Threepwood's.

1045
00:59:35,310 --> 00:59:36,427
Oh?

1046
00:59:36,452 --> 00:59:39,198
I suppose you'll think I'm a silly ass,
but I want to get hold of it.

1047
00:59:39,223 --> 00:59:41,903
- No doubt you have your reasons.
- Oh, long story.

1048
00:59:41,928 --> 00:59:43,981
Wheels within wheels.

1049
00:59:44,006 --> 00:59:45,748
But I want that book.

1050
00:59:45,773 --> 00:59:47,271
Beach has got it.

1051
00:59:48,013 --> 00:59:49,794
I expect you're used
to pinching things.

1052
00:59:50,247 --> 00:59:55,104
I have occasionally been commissioned
to recover articles of value.

1053
00:59:55,579 --> 00:59:58,823
Do you consider yourself
commissioned now?

1054
01:00:00,272 --> 01:00:02,827
I would for a fee
of one thousand pounds.

1055
01:00:03,460 --> 01:00:05,561
- One thousand...
- Pilbeam!

1056
01:00:05,586 --> 01:00:08,397
And you!
Whatever your name is.

1057
01:00:08,422 --> 01:00:09,856
Come on!

1058
01:00:09,881 --> 01:00:12,959
Come on! She's drowning!

1059
01:00:17,152 --> 01:00:19,965
Your way, Pilbeam!

1060
01:00:19,990 --> 01:00:22,783
Look, the other way!

1061
01:00:22,808 --> 01:00:24,603
This is my way!

1062
01:00:24,628 --> 01:00:26,820
Don't be a fool, man!

1063
01:00:26,845 --> 01:00:28,603
That's his way!

1064
01:00:28,882 --> 01:00:30,319
It's his way!

1065
01:00:31,106 --> 01:00:34,120
Imbecile! She'll have to be moved

1066
01:00:34,145 --> 01:00:36,242
if we can't keep her dry!

1067
01:00:36,778 --> 01:00:38,511
We're not keeping dry!

1068
01:00:38,536 --> 01:00:40,700
Who cares about you?

1069
01:00:40,942 --> 01:00:45,010
 Can I enter you
for champion pig?

1070
01:00:45,471 --> 01:00:47,096
The other way!

1071
01:00:47,401 --> 01:00:48,479
Come on!

1072
01:01:06,531 --> 01:01:09,437
Twenty-five quid
for my book?

1073
01:01:09,462 --> 01:01:10,467
Yes sir.

1074
01:01:10,666 --> 01:01:12,008
I ah,

1075
01:01:12,033 --> 01:01:14,853
realize it's an unusual hour sir, but

1076
01:01:14,878 --> 01:01:17,743
may I beg to offer you
a glass of port?

1077
01:01:17,768 --> 01:01:18,868
Well.

1078
01:01:18,893 --> 01:01:20,267
Thank you Beach.

1079
01:01:21,216 --> 01:01:23,769
I must say, you make yourself
very comfortable in here.

1080
01:01:23,794 --> 01:01:25,552
I endeavor to, sir.

1081
01:01:25,577 --> 01:01:27,974
So you think
Stinker Pyke's involved?

1082
01:01:27,999 --> 01:01:32,544
It seems that Sir Gregory secured
Mr Bodkin a position on a journal

1083
01:01:32,569 --> 01:01:33,942
known as

1084
01:01:33,969 --> 01:01:35,649
"Tiny Tots."

1085
01:01:35,674 --> 01:01:38,016
Just about his level,
little toad.

1086
01:01:38,041 --> 01:01:39,906
Chin-chin, Beach.

1087
01:01:44,941 --> 01:01:47,034
This is jolly good port, Beach.

1088
01:01:48,870 --> 01:01:50,144
Thank you sir.

1089
01:01:50,169 --> 01:01:52,792
So you reckon Bodkin
wants the book for Stinker

1090
01:01:52,817 --> 01:01:54,228
so that blighter
can publish it?

1091
01:01:54,253 --> 01:01:55,705
I fear that is so, sir.

1092
01:01:55,730 --> 01:01:58,040
On top of which,
he knows I have the manuscript.

1093
01:01:58,065 --> 01:02:01,120
Hence my request for you
to examine my security.

1094
01:02:03,547 --> 01:02:05,211
You feel it would be
safer somewhere else?

1095
01:02:05,236 --> 01:02:06,946
Considerably safer, sir.

1096
01:02:06,971 --> 01:02:09,805
I indeed wonder,
if perhaps

1097
01:02:10,125 --> 01:02:11,758
Mr Ronald?

1098
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:18,391
Thank you sir.

1099
01:02:19,912 --> 01:02:21,389
Are you, er,

1100
01:02:21,445 --> 01:02:23,086
feeling quite well, sir?

1101
01:02:23,717 --> 01:02:25,303
Yes, thank you Beach.

1102
01:02:26,170 --> 01:02:27,451
Thank you, sir.

1103
01:02:28,644 --> 01:02:29,668
Beach!

1104
01:02:31,051 --> 01:02:32,551
Yes sir?

1105
01:02:33,348 --> 01:02:35,330
You've known me a long time,
haven't you Beach?

1106
01:02:35,355 --> 01:02:36,832
Ever since I was
a whippersnapper?

1107
01:02:36,857 --> 01:02:38,066
Yes sir.

1108
01:02:38,613 --> 01:02:40,847
Many a sixpence you slipped me
when I was flat.

1109
01:02:41,313 --> 01:02:42,813
It was my pleasure, sir.

1110
01:02:44,300 --> 01:02:47,105
What's your opinion
of Miss Brown?

1111
01:02:47,652 --> 01:02:49,261
Speak freely, please.

1112
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:52,890
My opinion, sir.

1113
01:02:53,077 --> 01:02:54,499
Miss Brown...

1114
01:02:54,663 --> 01:02:56,702
is a girl
in a million.

1115
01:02:57,163 --> 01:02:59,327
- You really think so Beach?
- I do sir.

1116
01:02:59,352 --> 01:03:01,680
Oh, thank you Beach.

1117
01:03:02,397 --> 01:03:03,897
Thank you sir.

1118
01:03:07,381 --> 01:03:09,725
She IS a girl in a million.

1119
01:03:16,541 --> 01:03:19,087
Oh, Sue!

1120
01:03:40,393 --> 01:03:42,354
Poor old Monty.

1121
01:03:43,260 --> 01:03:45,370
How could I even think!

1122
01:03:45,846 --> 01:03:47,979
I mean...Monty!

1123
01:03:51,844 --> 01:03:53,000
Monty!

1124
01:03:53,852 --> 01:03:54,859
Hello!

1125
01:03:54,992 --> 01:03:56,664
- You're wet.
- Yes.

1126
01:03:57,349 --> 01:03:58,654
By Jove, why?

1127
01:04:00,209 --> 01:04:01,709
Poor old Monty!

1128
01:04:02,170 --> 01:04:05,154
Well you mustn't stand around like that,
must be dashed uncomfortable.

1129
01:04:05,512 --> 01:04:06,512
Yes.

1130
01:04:06,537 --> 01:04:08,441
Not to say jolly bad for your health.

1131
01:04:09,355 --> 01:04:11,815
- You'd better go and change.
- Yes.

1132
01:04:11,840 --> 01:04:14,355
- Can't have you catching cold, old chap.
- No.

1133
01:04:14,853 --> 01:04:17,525
- Have a hot bath.
- Right.

1134
01:04:29,905 --> 01:04:31,562
Oh Ronnie.

1135
01:04:40,414 --> 01:04:41,632
Come in.

1136
01:04:43,977 --> 01:04:45,727
I don't know if you know this stuff.

1137
01:04:45,752 --> 01:04:47,234
"Rigg's Golden Balm".

1138
01:04:47,259 --> 01:04:48,959
Embrocation. Rub it in,

1139
01:04:48,984 --> 01:04:50,695
communicates a warm glow.

1140
01:04:50,725 --> 01:04:52,724
- Dashed good of you.
- Not a bit.

1141
01:04:53,262 --> 01:04:54,676
You're sure it isn't for horses?

1142
01:04:55,152 --> 01:04:56,270
Horses?

1143
01:04:57,941 --> 01:05:00,611
Rub it on before you've read the directions,
feel like you've been dipped in vitriol.

1144
01:05:00,636 --> 01:05:02,141
No no no, that
stuff's all right.

1145
01:05:02,166 --> 01:05:04,103
- I use it myself.
- Then have at it!

1146
01:05:12,658 --> 01:05:15,361
On...your...chest...

1147
01:05:16,463 --> 01:05:19,408
There's something...on your chest.

1148
01:05:21,486 --> 01:05:22,760
It looks...

1149
01:05:23,147 --> 01:05:24,671
like "Sue".

1150
01:05:26,406 --> 01:05:27,632
"Sue".

1151
01:05:29,929 --> 01:05:30,929
No.

1152
01:05:31,163 --> 01:05:32,288
Not "Sue".

1153
01:05:32,835 --> 01:05:33,840
Not "Sue".

1154
01:05:34,192 --> 01:05:35,450
S. U. E.

1155
01:05:35,763 --> 01:05:38,294
Sarah Ursula Ebbsmith.

1156
01:05:38,591 --> 01:05:40,762
- What?
- Sarah Ursula Ebbsmith.

1157
01:05:40,787 --> 01:05:42,355
A girl I used to be engaged to.

1158
01:05:42,380 --> 01:05:45,036
She died. Pneumonia.
Very sad. Don't let's talk about it.

1159
01:05:46,315 --> 01:05:47,464
Oh.

1160
01:05:48,331 --> 01:05:49,511
Well.

1161
01:05:50,526 --> 01:05:51,612
Bung-o.

1162
01:05:57,766 --> 01:05:58,891
Phew.

1163
01:05:59,016 --> 01:06:00,211
A dashed near thing.

1164
01:06:03,569 --> 01:06:05,201
Oh, hello Ronnie.

1165
01:06:05,410 --> 01:06:06,472
Hello.

1166
01:06:07,556 --> 01:06:10,015
You can't stay indoors
on an afternoon like this,

1167
01:06:10,041 --> 01:06:12,431
- it's simply lovely out there.
- Yes.

1168
01:06:13,070 --> 01:06:15,326
Let's go for a drive
in your car.

1169
01:06:15,351 --> 01:06:16,945
I don't think I will, thanks.

1170
01:06:17,390 --> 01:06:19,976
Well then, let's take
a boat out on the lake.

1171
01:06:20,001 --> 01:06:21,069
Not for me, thanks.

1172
01:06:21,094 --> 01:06:24,139
- Well come for a walk
- Oh for God's sake, let me alone!

1173
01:06:28,850 --> 01:06:30,296
I'm sorry.

1174
01:06:32,301 --> 01:06:33,738
I shouldn't have said that.

1175
01:06:36,069 --> 01:06:38,248
No, I'm
glad you did.

1176
01:06:39,819 --> 01:06:42,037
It's better to come
right out with these things.

1177
01:06:51,703 --> 01:06:54,383
I think we might as well
just chuck it, don't you?

1178
01:06:59,922 --> 01:07:01,391
Just as you say.

1179
01:07:04,649 --> 01:07:06,172
All right.

1180
01:07:32,569 --> 01:07:33,905
Well, Mr Bodkin?

1181
01:07:35,587 --> 01:07:37,821
Have you considered our proposition?

1182
01:07:38,180 --> 01:07:39,265
1000 quid.

1183
01:07:39,290 --> 01:07:41,204
It's a set scale of fees.

1184
01:07:42,375 --> 01:07:43,491
Can I let you know?

1185
01:07:43,516 --> 01:07:44,522
Soon.

1186
01:07:44,547 --> 01:07:46,696
I have other clients
seeking my services.

1187
01:07:46,721 --> 01:07:48,053
Before dinner.

1188
01:07:48,749 --> 01:07:49,882
Right.

1189
01:07:50,257 --> 01:07:51,905
Excuse me, Mr Bodkin.

1190
01:07:58,968 --> 01:08:00,913
1000 quid.

1191
01:08:06,177 --> 01:08:07,872
Ronnie. Here you are.

1192
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:10,106
Been looking for you.

1193
01:08:10,131 --> 01:08:11,380
Really, Monty?

1194
01:08:11,863 --> 01:08:13,097
Well, here I am.

1195
01:08:13,122 --> 01:08:16,169
Tell me old man,
how do you stand with Beach?

1196
01:08:16,194 --> 01:08:18,536
- With Beach!
- Well...

1197
01:08:18,703 --> 01:08:20,805
Does he feel pretty feudal
where you're concerned?

1198
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:23,788
Would he be inclined to stretch a point
to oblige the young master?

1199
01:08:23,813 --> 01:08:26,209
What is all this bilge, Monty?
Come to the point.

1200
01:08:26,234 --> 01:08:27,367
I'm coming to the point.

1201
01:08:27,392 --> 01:08:28,664
Well be quick about it.

1202
01:08:30,461 --> 01:08:31,726
Good shot.

1203
01:08:32,101 --> 01:08:33,385
You were coming to the point.

1204
01:08:33,410 --> 01:08:34,887
Yes. Right. Well.

1205
01:08:34,912 --> 01:08:36,660
Here's the nub on the gist.

1206
01:08:36,988 --> 01:08:39,020
You know old Gally's written a book?

1207
01:08:39,199 --> 01:08:41,778
There was a young man of Bryn Mawr,

1208
01:08:42,598 --> 01:08:44,434
Who carried his drinking too far,

1209
01:08:45,363 --> 01:08:47,550
He said, "I'll just have..."

1210
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:51,695
Ah, young woman!

1211
01:08:51,828 --> 01:08:53,124
I was looking for you.

1212
01:08:53,351 --> 01:08:55,593
Always find this
a depressing time of day,

1213
01:08:55,679 --> 01:08:57,460
waiting for the cocktail hour.

1214
01:08:58,785 --> 01:08:59,973
Did I ever tell you

1215
01:08:59,998 --> 01:09:02,723
that story about old
Puffy Benger and the...

1216
01:09:03,723 --> 01:09:04,738
What's the trouble?

1217
01:09:06,969 --> 01:09:08,571
Oh Gally!

1218
01:09:08,750 --> 01:09:10,305
Oh!

1219
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:14,696
There, there.

1220
01:09:14,860 --> 01:09:16,241
So there it is.

1221
01:09:16,266 --> 01:09:17,785
If I can get Beach to
give me this manuscript

1222
01:09:17,810 --> 01:09:19,094
I can get a job
with old Tilbury

1223
01:09:19,123 --> 01:09:20,912
and be in position to marry
the girl I love.

1224
01:09:20,937 --> 01:09:23,562
Sarah Ursula Ebbsmith.

1225
01:09:23,769 --> 01:09:24,777
Eh?

1226
01:09:24,802 --> 01:09:26,796
Oh, no, no.

1227
01:09:26,836 --> 01:09:29,490
No not poor dear Sarah.
No, she died.

1228
01:09:29,515 --> 01:09:31,097
Tuberculosis, very sad.

1229
01:09:31,122 --> 01:09:32,609
You told me it was pneumonia.

1230
01:09:33,285 --> 01:09:35,534
- No, tuberculosis.
- I see.

1231
01:09:35,559 --> 01:09:39,745
This is a new one.
Girl named Gertrude Butterwick.

1232
01:09:39,770 --> 01:09:43,145
- Gertrude Butterwick, eh?
- That's right.

1233
01:09:43,354 --> 01:09:44,901
- Fond of her?
- My dear chap.

1234
01:09:45,104 --> 01:09:47,125
- I suppose she's crazy about you.
- Oh, deeply enamored.

1235
01:09:47,150 --> 01:09:49,266
Of course.
Why wouldn't she be?

1236
01:09:50,227 --> 01:09:52,133
Why would she consider
anyone else?

1237
01:09:52,852 --> 01:09:55,842
Especially anyone so
small and pink.

1238
01:09:55,867 --> 01:09:56,882
Eh?

1239
01:09:58,155 --> 01:09:59,748
You shall have her.

1240
01:09:59,983 --> 01:10:01,139
Really?

1241
01:10:01,287 --> 01:10:03,975
Beach hasn't got the manuscript,
he gave it to me.

1242
01:10:04,238 --> 01:10:05,996
You'll find it in the chest
of drawers in my room.

1243
01:10:06,021 --> 01:10:07,136
Take the damn thing
if you want it.

1244
01:10:07,161 --> 01:10:08,925
- My dear old boy!
- Go!

1245
01:10:08,950 --> 01:10:11,605
Go now, take your
chance of a life and go!

1246
01:10:11,630 --> 01:10:13,074
Right-ho!

1247
01:10:13,581 --> 01:10:14,808
Excuse me, Gally.

1248
01:10:14,877 --> 01:10:16,590
What's the matter with him?
Oh it doesn't matter.

1249
01:10:16,615 --> 01:10:17,750
It's you I want to see.

1250
01:10:17,775 --> 01:10:19,392
Sorry Gally, not in the mood
for billiards, I'm just off...

1251
01:10:19,417 --> 01:10:21,659
Just off be damned!
You stay here and listen to me.

1252
01:10:21,684 --> 01:10:25,101
You may only go when I've knocked
some sense into your dotty head!

1253
01:10:41,498 --> 01:10:43,600
Well, if you've got it, that's fine!

1254
01:10:43,625 --> 01:10:44,861
Sorry, old sleuth.

1255
01:10:44,886 --> 01:10:46,308
I'm afraid it means
you won't get your fee.

1256
01:10:46,333 --> 01:10:48,308
Oh please, don't worry.

1257
01:10:48,886 --> 01:10:50,636
I hope you've
hidden it carefully.

1258
01:10:50,661 --> 01:10:53,292
Under the bed in my room,
right up against the wall.

1259
01:10:53,317 --> 01:10:55,344
- That should be fine.
- Yes.

1260
01:10:55,369 --> 01:10:57,013
And, what are you
going to do with it?

1261
01:10:57,038 --> 01:10:58,923
I'm taking it down to
the Emsworth Arms tonight,

1262
01:10:58,948 --> 01:11:00,729
to a fellow by the name of Tilbury.

1263
01:11:00,754 --> 01:11:03,189
- Not Lord Tilbury?
- That's right.

1264
01:11:03,214 --> 01:11:05,649
- Do you know him?
- Know of him.

1265
01:11:05,674 --> 01:11:07,353
Now it all adds up.

1266
01:11:07,378 --> 01:11:09,945
Lord Tilbury wants to
publish the book!

1267
01:11:09,987 --> 01:11:12,729
- Spot on.
- I bet he'll give you a pretty big reward.

1268
01:11:12,754 --> 01:11:14,024
Oh I'm not asking for money.

1269
01:11:14,049 --> 01:11:15,995
He's promised me a job if I can
get the manuscript for him.

1270
01:11:16,020 --> 01:11:17,095
Are you leaving here then?

1271
01:11:17,120 --> 01:11:18,855
I expect the sack
any moment.

1272
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:21,016
It was Tilbury
locked in the potting-shed.

1273
01:11:21,242 --> 01:11:23,727
If old Emsworth knew it was me
who flung wide the gates

1274
01:11:23,752 --> 01:11:25,297
he'd throw me
out in a second.

1275
01:11:25,505 --> 01:11:26,716
Dare say you're right.

1276
01:11:31,326 --> 01:11:32,598
Galahad!

1277
01:11:32,623 --> 01:11:34,278
Where on earth
are you taking me?

1278
01:11:34,303 --> 01:11:36,692
You still think Sue Brown
loves Monty Bodkin?

1279
01:11:36,717 --> 01:11:38,951
The evidence I have
convinces me she does!

1280
01:11:38,976 --> 01:11:41,857
Evidence! Precisely, Julia!
Sh-sh-sh-sh-sh-sh!

1281
01:11:43,364 --> 01:11:44,552
Voila.

1282
01:11:47,841 --> 01:11:49,802
Did you ever see
a more devoted couple?

1283
01:11:52,864 --> 01:11:55,083
A young man can kiss a chorus-girl.

1284
01:11:55,108 --> 01:11:57,341
It does not mean he has to marry her.

1285
01:11:58,692 --> 01:11:59,927
Very well then, Julia,

1286
01:11:59,952 --> 01:12:01,450
I have something to
say which I fancy

1287
01:12:01,475 --> 01:12:02,592
might interest you.

1288
01:12:03,965 --> 01:12:06,965
It isn't, by any chance,
that if their marriage is stopped,

1289
01:12:06,990 --> 01:12:09,324
you will publish
your Reminiscences?

1290
01:12:09,432 --> 01:12:10,511
It is.

1291
01:12:11,175 --> 01:12:12,540
Publish away.

1292
01:12:12,565 --> 01:12:14,237
Julia, one moment.

1293
01:12:17,196 --> 01:12:18,267
Well?

1294
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:21,870
You are the relict of the late
Major-General Sir Miles Fish,

1295
01:12:21,895 --> 01:12:24,620
C.B.E., late of the
Brigate of Guards?

1296
01:12:24,776 --> 01:12:26,205
I have never denied it.

1297
01:12:26,230 --> 01:12:30,137
When Sir Miles married you, he was
a respectable, even a stodgy, Colonel.

1298
01:12:30,162 --> 01:12:32,508
When you first met him,
you even thought him slow.

1299
01:12:32,533 --> 01:12:36,078
Believe me, Julia,
when I knew dear old Fishy Fish,

1300
01:12:36,103 --> 01:12:39,856
while you were poisoning governesses' lives,
he was the reverse of slow.

1301
01:12:39,881 --> 01:12:43,029
His jolly rapidity
was the talk of London.

1302
01:12:44,577 --> 01:12:45,772
Gally!

1303
01:12:46,022 --> 01:12:49,186
- You haven't...
- See chapters 3, 11, 16, 17,

1304
01:12:49,211 --> 01:12:52,484
and 21.
Especially...21.

1305
01:12:53,112 --> 01:12:56,089
Excuse me. I have a little
business with the young folks.

1306
01:13:05,219 --> 01:13:06,935
Excuse me Lord Emsworth.

1307
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:10,523
May I have a word?

1308
01:13:12,592 --> 01:13:14,170
Oh, Gally.

1309
01:13:14,248 --> 01:13:16,451
I think you're wonderful.

1310
01:13:16,482 --> 01:13:18,072
 Careful,
he'll be jealous of me next.

1311
01:13:18,097 --> 01:13:19,260
There's no need to rub it in.

1312
01:13:19,285 --> 01:13:20,636
Now hear this you young poop.

1313
01:13:20,661 --> 01:13:21,769
He is not a poop.

1314
01:13:21,794 --> 01:13:23,567
Allow me to recognize
a poop when I see one.

1315
01:13:23,592 --> 01:13:25,821
- You must guard that manuscript with your life.
- Ah.

1316
01:13:25,846 --> 01:13:29,722
To lay their hands on it, your mother and Lady Constance
would descend to the level of beasts of the field.

1317
01:13:29,747 --> 01:13:33,605
Young Monty Bodkin is after it too and
Monty Bodkin is an A-1 snake in the grass.

1318
01:13:33,628 --> 01:13:37,070
He wants to give it to the publisher, Lord Tilbury,
who I used to know as Stinker Pyke.

1319
01:13:37,095 --> 01:13:38,852
- Uncle Gally!
- What is it?

1320
01:13:39,808 --> 01:13:40,980
Bodkin?

1321
01:13:41,621 --> 01:13:42,785
Bodkin?

1322
01:13:43,660 --> 01:13:44,660
Bodkin?

1323
01:13:48,603 --> 01:13:49,674
Sorry Beach.

1324
01:13:49,699 --> 01:13:50,777
Have you seen Bodkin?

1325
01:13:51,095 --> 01:13:52,463
I'm very sorry sir,

1326
01:13:52,488 --> 01:13:55,538
I'm not aware of
Mr Bodkin's whereabouts.

1327
01:13:56,538 --> 01:13:57,601
Thank you Beach.

1328
01:14:07,247 --> 01:14:08,840
Ah! There you are!

1329
01:14:09,606 --> 01:14:11,153
You bloodstained Bodkin!

1330
01:14:11,178 --> 01:14:13,384
- Oh hello.
- Never mind "Oh hello".

1331
01:14:13,416 --> 01:14:15,518
I want that manuscript of
mine and I want it at once.

1332
01:14:15,543 --> 01:14:17,049
I haven't got your
bally manuscript.

1333
01:14:17,074 --> 01:14:19,712
- Don't lie to me, young Bodkin.
- I'm not lying to you.

1334
01:14:20,032 --> 01:14:22,110
- Pilbeam's got it.
- Pilbeam?

1335
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:25,955
I told the foul, double-crossing
little blister where it was,

1336
01:14:25,987 --> 01:14:27,822
and he went off and
squealed to Lord Emsworth

1337
01:14:27,847 --> 01:14:30,469
about me letting old Tilbury
out of the potting shed,

1338
01:14:30,494 --> 01:14:32,604
and Lord Emsworth sent
for me and fired me,

1339
01:14:32,629 --> 01:14:35,057
and while I was out of
the way, being fired,

1340
01:14:35,082 --> 01:14:37,260
he nipped up to my room
and sneaked the thing!

1341
01:14:37,705 --> 01:14:38,986
Pilbeam!

1342
01:15:24,981 --> 01:15:27,019
Ah, Mr Pilbeam.

1343
01:15:27,044 --> 01:15:29,434
Lady Constance was
asking for you.

1344
01:15:29,961 --> 01:15:32,016
Her Ladyship is in
the drawing-room.

1345
01:15:32,641 --> 01:15:34,046
I'll tell you what,

1346
01:15:34,071 --> 01:15:36,219
bring me a bottle
of champagne first,

1347
01:15:36,244 --> 01:15:37,759
and I'll look into the matter.

1348
01:15:38,805 --> 01:15:40,258
Champagne, sir?

1349
01:15:40,727 --> 01:15:41,961
Champagne.

1350
01:15:56,609 --> 01:15:58,586
Steady, Pirbright!

1351
01:15:58,611 --> 01:15:59,617
Steady!

1352
01:16:00,765 --> 01:16:03,312
It's all right,
my beauty.

1353
01:16:04,718 --> 01:16:09,055
As soon as she's settled,
you repair that roof.

1354
01:16:10,067 --> 01:16:15,846
We'll have you back in your boudoir
before bedtime, you adorable girl.

1355
01:16:48,948 --> 01:16:50,659
Sit down, Mr Pilbeam.

1356
01:16:56,237 --> 01:16:58,492
Now then, Mr Pilbeam,
about that book.

1357
01:16:58,517 --> 01:17:01,890
I cannot understand what you
have been doing all this time.

1358
01:17:01,915 --> 01:17:04,546
Sir Gregory told me
you were enterprising.

1359
01:17:04,571 --> 01:17:07,250
You seem to have as much
enterprise as a...

1360
01:17:07,275 --> 01:17:08,758
- slug.
- Exactly.

1361
01:17:08,783 --> 01:17:10,018
As a slug.

1362
01:17:10,043 --> 01:17:12,738
Less.
I've known some quite nippy slugs.

1363
01:17:13,066 --> 01:17:15,253
You've not even found out
where the manuscript is.

1364
01:17:15,278 --> 01:17:16,372
Oh!

1365
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:18,098
Haven't I?

1366
01:17:19,450 --> 01:17:21,442
Well?
Where is it, then?

1367
01:17:21,467 --> 01:17:23,222
Has my brother
given it to someone?

1368
01:17:23,247 --> 01:17:26,989
- He gave it to Beash.
- Beash. Beash?

1369
01:17:27,014 --> 01:17:29,751
- Think he means Beach.
- Beach?

1370
01:17:29,776 --> 01:17:31,258
I will see Beach at once.

1371
01:17:31,283 --> 01:17:33,530
Oh, fat lot of good
that's going to do you.

1372
01:17:33,555 --> 01:17:35,998
A fat, fat, fat lot of good!

1373
01:17:36,023 --> 01:17:38,458
Forgive the personal
question Mr Pilbeam,

1374
01:17:38,483 --> 01:17:41,130
but are you slightly
intoxicated?

1375
01:17:41,813 --> 01:17:43,565
A little blotto.

1376
01:17:43,590 --> 01:17:46,752
I had a bottle of champagne
on an empty stomach.

1377
01:17:46,777 --> 01:17:49,799
Are you interested in Mr Pilbeam's
stomach, Julia?

1378
01:17:49,824 --> 01:17:51,010
I am not.

1379
01:17:51,035 --> 01:17:54,090
Let's waive your stomach,
Mr Pilbeam.

1380
01:17:54,115 --> 01:17:57,279
Why would it do us a "fat lot of good"
seeing Beach?

1381
01:17:57,304 --> 01:17:59,365
Because he hasn't got it.

1382
01:17:59,390 --> 01:18:01,482
He gave it to Ronnie,

1383
01:18:01,507 --> 01:18:04,592
Ronnie gave it to
Bonty Modkin,

1384
01:18:04,619 --> 01:18:06,924
Pilbeam took it

1385
01:18:06,949 --> 01:18:09,062
from Bonty Modkin,

1386
01:18:09,087 --> 01:18:11,702
So you mean,
you have the manuscript?

1387
01:18:11,727 --> 01:18:14,327
Yes Connie!
I have!

1388
01:18:14,352 --> 01:18:16,932
Then in the name of goodness,
where is it?

1389
01:18:17,830 --> 01:18:20,654
Ahhh...
now that's telling!

1390
01:18:21,204 --> 01:18:24,225
Mr Pilbeam, I insist on knowing
what you have done with it.

1391
01:18:24,250 --> 01:18:26,681
Kindly let us have no more
of this nonsense.

1392
01:18:26,706 --> 01:18:27,946
Oh.

1393
01:18:28,368 --> 01:18:30,423
Oh it's like that, is it?

1394
01:18:30,831 --> 01:18:34,415
Well let me tell you, Connie,
that I don't like your tone.

1395
01:18:34,440 --> 01:18:36,714
- Tone?
- Tone!

1396
01:18:37,144 --> 01:18:38,714
Being insulted!

1397
01:18:39,313 --> 01:18:42,387
I got that manuscript in
somewhere you won't find it,

1398
01:18:42,412 --> 01:18:45,050
I was going to let you and Tilbury
bid against each other for it

1399
01:18:45,075 --> 01:18:47,230
but now it's going to Tilbury.

1400
01:18:47,255 --> 01:18:48,635
- Tilbury?
- Tilbury?

1401
01:18:48,660 --> 01:18:51,236
You mean Galahad's
publisher, Tilbury?

1402
01:18:51,261 --> 01:18:54,652
Well I certainly don't
mean Tilbury Docks!

1403
01:18:58,290 --> 01:18:59,423
You see, Connie?

1404
01:19:00,135 --> 01:19:01,186
You see?

1405
01:19:01,596 --> 01:19:03,748
It's always your tone!

1406
01:19:04,051 --> 01:19:05,561
My tone?

1407
01:19:07,124 --> 01:19:08,319
Ugh...

1408
01:19:25,742 --> 01:19:28,266
I engaged him
in good faith, you know.

1409
01:19:28,291 --> 01:19:30,156
You engaged him
to steal my manuscript.

1410
01:19:30,181 --> 01:19:32,250
But not to commit to Tilbury!

1411
01:19:32,275 --> 01:19:35,437
We should never have trusted him
when we saw that moustache.

1412
01:19:37,938 --> 01:19:39,334
Mr Pilbeam?

1413
01:19:41,202 --> 01:19:42,945
Mr Pilbeam?

1414
01:19:43,202 --> 01:19:45,476
I saw, Pilbeam old chap.

1415
01:19:45,944 --> 01:19:47,491
Have you got a headache?

1416
01:19:47,631 --> 01:19:50,225
Would you care for
some bicarbonate?

1417
01:19:50,250 --> 01:19:52,902
Oh this is nonsense,
I'm going in.

1418
01:19:53,894 --> 01:19:55,901
- Where is he?
- He's gone!

1419
01:19:55,926 --> 01:19:58,394
The little smuggler's flown!

1420
01:20:13,378 --> 01:20:14,746
Now look here, Lord Tilbury,

1421
01:20:15,588 --> 01:20:17,057
you're a fair man at heart,

1422
01:20:25,341 --> 01:20:26,388
Bodkin!

1423
01:20:26,927 --> 01:20:28,208
I say Lord Tilbury,

1424
01:20:28,233 --> 01:20:29,732
about that manuscript,

1425
01:20:30,583 --> 01:20:31,911
I'm getting it.

1426
01:20:32,630 --> 01:20:35,232
Chap called Pilbeam
telephoned me.

1427
01:20:35,958 --> 01:20:38,029
He's bringing it here.

1428
01:20:38,461 --> 01:20:40,727
Yes.
The point I wish to make, Lord Tilbury,

1429
01:20:40,752 --> 01:20:43,000
is that Mr Pilbeam would
not be in possession of it

1430
01:20:43,025 --> 01:20:44,428
had I not had it first.

1431
01:20:44,453 --> 01:20:47,976
Therefore in fairness it seems to me our
agreement still holds, what do you say to that?

1432
01:20:51,402 --> 01:20:52,620
No.

1433
01:20:53,057 --> 01:20:54,062
No.

1434
01:20:54,511 --> 01:20:55,519
No.

1435
01:20:55,870 --> 01:20:56,884
You don't mean no.

1436
01:20:56,909 --> 01:20:57,941
I do.

1437
01:20:58,861 --> 01:21:01,517
You fat, double-crossing warthog.

1438
01:21:01,720 --> 01:21:03,040
Warthog?

1439
01:21:35,654 --> 01:21:38,879
She seemed happy when
we moved her, didn't she?

1440
01:21:38,904 --> 01:21:40,232
Aye, m'lud.

1441
01:21:42,295 --> 01:21:43,669
Cheese!

1442
01:21:43,694 --> 01:21:45,337
There she is,

1443
01:21:45,362 --> 01:21:47,001
chomping away,

1444
01:21:47,026 --> 01:21:48,760
happy as a...

1445
01:21:50,424 --> 01:21:52,760
God bless my soul.

1446
01:21:54,747 --> 01:21:57,622
What's that she's eating, Pirbright?

1447
01:21:58,216 --> 01:22:00,864
Can you see what she's eating?

1448
01:22:04,534 --> 01:22:05,597
Pirbright.

1449
01:22:06,042 --> 01:22:07,151
Pirbright.

1450
01:22:07,596 --> 01:22:09,893
It looks like...paper.

1451
01:22:10,891 --> 01:22:14,070
Great chunks of paper!

1452
01:22:16,813 --> 01:22:18,055
Cor!

1453
01:22:21,116 --> 01:22:22,420
The vet!

1454
01:22:22,678 --> 01:22:24,061
Get the vet!

1455
01:22:24,147 --> 01:22:28,475
- The vet?
- The Empress has eaten Galahad's book!

1456
01:22:28,500 --> 01:22:30,024
Galahad's book?

1457
01:22:30,049 --> 01:22:33,019
The Empress has
eaten Galahad's book!

1458
01:22:33,044 --> 01:22:34,633
Is this eaten,
all of it?

1459
01:22:34,658 --> 01:22:39,611
Do I not speak English
or are you all barking mad?

1460
01:22:39,779 --> 01:22:41,476
Eaten the book!

1461
01:22:41,501 --> 01:22:44,989
I'll be...
adopted as a Conservative candidate!

1462
01:22:45,014 --> 01:22:48,006
And I can stop Ronnie
marrying that girl!

1463
01:22:48,031 --> 01:22:51,584
Oh Clarence!
What a clever pig!

1464
01:22:58,858 --> 01:23:00,241
Eaten the book?

1465
01:23:00,266 --> 01:23:02,600
Yes. I heard it from the vet.

1466
01:23:02,625 --> 01:23:04,973
He was having a quick one
when they phoned him from home.

1467
01:23:04,998 --> 01:23:07,203
He had to rush up to the
Castle straightaway.

1468
01:23:07,228 --> 01:23:08,238
Good Lord.

1469
01:23:18,526 --> 01:23:21,628
Though how a book could have got
into a pig sty, I can't imagine.

1470
01:23:22,550 --> 01:23:23,878
Excuse me.

1471
01:23:25,665 --> 01:23:26,665
Yes sir?

1472
01:23:26,852 --> 01:23:28,273
I'm looking for Lord Tilbury.

1473
01:23:28,416 --> 01:23:30,571
I believe His Lordship's
in the garden, sir.

1474
01:23:30,634 --> 01:23:31,639
Right.

1475
01:23:42,256 --> 01:23:44,247
I thought you were
bringing the manuscript here!

1476
01:23:44,272 --> 01:23:48,240
No no no, too risky.
For safety's sake I couldn't do that.

1477
01:23:48,265 --> 01:23:51,491
But of course, as soon as you write
the cheque I'll tell you where it's hidden.

1478
01:23:51,516 --> 01:23:53,953
Why, you surely don't
expect me to...

1479
01:23:53,978 --> 01:23:56,836
- pay, before...
- It's your choice,

1480
01:23:56,861 --> 01:23:58,506
I have other customers.

1481
01:23:58,531 --> 01:24:00,024
Take it or leave it.

1482
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,409
I really think you might trust me.

1483
01:24:04,434 --> 01:24:06,159
1000 pounds.

1484
01:24:09,365 --> 01:24:10,716
Very well.

1485
01:24:13,681 --> 01:24:15,470
Make it to "cash",
if you don't mind.

1486
01:24:16,478 --> 01:24:17,900
Cash.

1487
01:24:20,389 --> 01:24:23,228
I can't imagine that
you're afraid of pigs.

1488
01:24:25,296 --> 01:24:27,934
What on earth do
pigs got to do with it?

1489
01:24:28,927 --> 01:24:30,011
Pigs

1490
01:24:30,036 --> 01:24:31,121
love me.

1491
01:24:34,520 --> 01:24:35,684
Oh.

1492
01:24:35,716 --> 01:24:37,349
She's all right.

1493
01:24:37,374 --> 01:24:40,426
The vet says it will
do her no harm at all.

1494
01:24:40,451 --> 01:24:43,693
Might even be
beneficial roughage.

1495
01:24:46,006 --> 01:24:48,240
Oh I can't believe that
would have suited her.

1496
01:24:48,272 --> 01:24:49,690
There's his clothes, you see.

1497
01:24:49,715 --> 01:24:52,650
- Bound to contain...
- Yes, yes, yes Clarence.

1498
01:24:52,854 --> 01:24:54,386
Now, come and sit down.

1499
01:24:54,411 --> 01:24:58,448
We'll let her rest here for a bit, then
we'll take her back to her proper home.

1500
01:24:58,473 --> 01:24:59,878
Now, Clarence?

1501
01:25:00,634 --> 01:25:02,950
We need to make absolutely sure

1502
01:25:02,975 --> 01:25:05,733
that you are determined
to be firm with Ronald.

1503
01:25:05,758 --> 01:25:07,908
Yes.
Who?

1504
01:25:08,470 --> 01:25:09,477
Ronald.

1505
01:25:09,861 --> 01:25:10,869
Ronald!

1506
01:25:11,055 --> 01:25:12,674
Your nephew, Ronald!

1507
01:25:12,699 --> 01:25:13,996
Connie!

1508
01:25:14,262 --> 01:25:15,645
Tone?

1509
01:25:20,671 --> 01:25:23,489
Now that the manuscript
has been destroyed,

1510
01:25:23,739 --> 01:25:28,133
there is no longer any reason for this
unsuitable marriage to be tolerated.

1511
01:25:28,512 --> 01:25:32,391
When Ronald asks you
to release his money,

1512
01:25:32,416 --> 01:25:34,761
You will, of course, refuse.

1513
01:25:34,786 --> 01:25:35,792
What?

1514
01:25:36,410 --> 01:25:38,284
- Refuse.
- Eh?

1515
01:25:38,558 --> 01:25:40,705
- Refuse.  Do you...

1516
01:25:41,370 --> 01:25:43,105
Yes Beach, what is it?

1517
01:25:43,130 --> 01:25:45,132
I beg your pardon, your Ladyship,

1518
01:25:45,157 --> 01:25:48,064
but there is a telephone
call for Lord Emsworth.

1519
01:25:48,204 --> 01:25:50,228
For Clarence? Who is it?

1520
01:25:50,253 --> 01:25:54,198
A gentleman who describes
himself as, "a friend".

1521
01:26:03,678 --> 01:26:05,006
Thank you.

1522
01:26:06,428 --> 01:26:07,779
Lord Emsworth?

1523
01:26:07,902 --> 01:26:10,652
Yes, Lord Emsworth speaking.

1524
01:26:10,829 --> 01:26:14,655
I've reason to believe, Lord Emsworth, 
that some time this evening,

1525
01:26:14,680 --> 01:26:17,134
an attack is to be made upon your pig.

1526
01:26:17,159 --> 01:26:20,147
- What.
- An attack upon your pig.

1527
01:26:20,475 --> 01:26:22,483
- This evening?
- This evening.

1528
01:26:22,508 --> 01:26:25,834
- What time, this evening?
- Any time now.

1529
01:26:25,859 --> 01:26:28,961
- Goodbye, Lord Emsworth.
- No! Don't...

1530
01:26:29,607 --> 01:26:31,028
Don't go!

1531
01:26:31,342 --> 01:26:33,294
Oh good

1532
01:26:33,723 --> 01:26:34,832
heavens!

1533
01:26:35,615 --> 01:26:38,646
BEACH!!!

1534
01:26:38,671 --> 01:26:40,601
Clarence, what on
earth's the matter?

1535
01:26:41,714 --> 01:26:43,558
Where's Parsloe?

1536
01:26:43,583 --> 01:26:46,024
Sir Gregory left the house
a little while ago.

1537
01:26:46,049 --> 01:26:47,388
He wished to take a walk.

1538
01:26:47,413 --> 01:26:50,380
- What!
- And you must dress for dinner!

1539
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:52,187
BEACH!!!

1540
01:26:52,212 --> 01:26:54,009
You rang, milord?

1541
01:26:54,034 --> 01:26:55,585
BEACH!!!

1542
01:26:55,610 --> 01:26:57,899
And called, milord?

1543
01:26:57,924 --> 01:27:00,264
Beach, there's not a moment to lose.

1544
01:27:00,289 --> 01:27:02,795
I've just heard there's to be
an attack on the Empress

1545
01:27:02,820 --> 01:27:05,717
and it's Parsloe, Parsloe,
of course it is.

1546
01:27:05,742 --> 01:27:07,786
Oh, for goodness sake, Clarence!

1547
01:27:07,811 --> 01:27:11,114
Tell Pirbright to get out there
and take a stout stick.

1548
01:27:11,139 --> 01:27:14,786
If Parsloe gives trouble,
he is to THUMP HIM HARD!

1549
01:27:15,206 --> 01:27:16,245
Hard.

1550
01:27:16,270 --> 01:27:19,168
Clarence!
Are you out of your mind?

1551
01:27:38,355 --> 01:27:39,394
Bodkin!

1552
01:27:40,347 --> 01:27:43,509
Bodkin, no.
There's a cheque for 1000 pounds in there.

1553
01:27:43,534 --> 01:27:44,594
I know.

1554
01:27:45,167 --> 01:27:46,425
Bodkin!

1555
01:28:34,036 --> 01:28:36,848
You'll pay me
2000 pounds?

1556
01:28:36,873 --> 01:28:38,621
Oh, I've got
packets of money.

1557
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:40,168
I'm simply ill
with the stuff.

1558
01:28:40,193 --> 01:28:42,762
I'll write you a cheque now, 
if you'll give me a job.

1559
01:28:42,787 --> 01:28:45,238
I want to be
an assistant detective.

1560
01:28:45,263 --> 01:28:46,865
You shall be.

1561
01:28:46,890 --> 01:28:49,425
- For a year.
- For 2000 pounds,

1562
01:28:49,450 --> 01:28:52,619
- five years, ten years, whatever you want.
- A year, that's all.

1563
01:28:52,644 --> 01:28:54,910
A job for a year.

1564
01:28:55,417 --> 01:28:56,931
It's yours.

1565
01:28:56,956 --> 01:29:00,074
Oh!
Glorious dawn!

1566
01:29:00,384 --> 01:29:03,548
Oh wondrous dreams fulfilled!

1567
01:29:04,523 --> 01:29:06,086
Butterwick's her name.

1568
01:29:06,617 --> 01:29:08,351
Gertrude Butterwick.

1569
01:29:08,865 --> 01:29:11,304
- It wasn't Parsloe.
- No m'lud.

1570
01:29:11,329 --> 01:29:13,898
- Same blighter you caught before.
- Aye m'lud.

1571
01:29:13,923 --> 01:29:17,056
- And you're sure he's locked up secure this time.
- Aye m'lud.

1572
01:29:17,103 --> 01:29:19,359
Leave him there overnight, then

1573
01:29:19,384 --> 01:29:21,775
hose him down and
send for the constable.

1574
01:29:23,621 --> 01:29:26,144
Right Connie,
about this...

1575
01:29:26,377 --> 01:29:28,978
- Oh. Hello, Pirbright.
- Sir.

1576
01:29:29,705 --> 01:29:31,478
Now, Connie.
About this marriage,

1577
01:29:31,503 --> 01:29:33,101
I suppose you've been
nagging and bullying

1578
01:29:33,126 --> 01:29:34,742
poor old Clarence so that he
doesn't know where he is?

1579
01:29:34,767 --> 01:29:36,398
Not at all, Galahad.

1580
01:29:36,423 --> 01:29:40,415
I'm sure Clarence understands perfectly 
well which is the right thing to do.

1581
01:29:43,134 --> 01:29:44,985
- Clarence!
- Clarence.

1582
01:29:45,515 --> 01:29:47,374
I want you to take a
good look at this girl.

1583
01:29:51,093 --> 01:29:52,170
What do you think of her?

1584
01:29:55,038 --> 01:29:56,045
Charming.

1585
01:29:56,780 --> 01:29:57,788
Charming.

1586
01:29:57,954 --> 01:29:59,890
So does Ronnie get his money,
or doesn't he?

1587
01:29:59,915 --> 01:30:00,923
Ah.

1588
01:30:01,436 --> 01:30:03,350
- Connie seems to think...
- Oh...

1589
01:30:03,375 --> 01:30:05,115
- damn Connie!
- Galahad!

1590
01:30:05,140 --> 01:30:07,600
Er, may I say something?

1591
01:30:07,733 --> 01:30:10,468
It's only this:
I'm awfully sorry to upset everyone,

1592
01:30:10,493 --> 01:30:12,741
but Ronnie and I are
motoring to London tonight,

1593
01:30:12,766 --> 01:30:15,674
- and we're going to get married tomorrow.
- What?

1594
01:30:15,699 --> 01:30:17,564
We decided it was the
best thing to do,

1595
01:30:17,589 --> 01:30:19,517
then we feel that 
everything will be all right.

1596
01:30:19,673 --> 01:30:22,773
Oh, and Ronnie has the Empress
in the dicky of his car.

1597
01:30:22,798 --> 01:30:23,805
What?

1598
01:30:23,830 --> 01:30:26,734
And what Ronnie thinks he'll do
is take her joy-riding.

1599
01:30:26,759 --> 01:30:28,306
Joy-riding?

1600
01:30:28,331 --> 01:30:29,537
All over England.

1601
01:30:29,562 --> 01:30:31,385
I don't believe it.

1602
01:30:31,410 --> 01:30:33,668
He thought you might not,
so he's waiting in the drive.

1603
01:30:41,575 --> 01:30:43,091
Ronald!

1604
01:30:45,318 --> 01:30:46,677
Ronald!

1605
01:30:51,318 --> 01:30:53,448
I'm afraid it's no good
shouting at him.

1606
01:30:53,751 --> 01:30:56,347
Of course it isn't. What you want
to do is give a formal promise

1607
01:30:56,372 --> 01:30:57,930
before witnesses
to cough up that money,

1608
01:30:57,970 --> 01:30:59,827
then you can write out a cheque
for honeymoon expenses,

1609
01:30:59,852 --> 01:31:01,384

say, thousand or two.

1610
01:31:01,409 --> 01:31:03,534
But then the Empress
can go back to bed.

1611
01:31:06,240 --> 01:31:07,637
Clarence,

1612
01:31:07,662 --> 01:31:09,904
Clarence, you are
not to do this.

1613
01:31:09,929 --> 01:31:12,475
I certainly am
going to do it.

1614
01:31:12,500 --> 01:31:16,392
Does this miserable pig mean more to you
than your nephew's whole future?

1615
01:31:16,417 --> 01:31:18,292
Of course it does.

1616
01:31:18,595 --> 01:31:20,788
Anyway, what's wrong
with his future?

1617
01:31:20,813 --> 01:31:23,454
He's going to marry
this nice little girl.

1618
01:31:23,479 --> 01:31:24,852
She'll look after him.

1619
01:31:24,877 --> 01:31:26,057
Bravely spoken, Clarence.

1620
01:31:28,085 --> 01:31:29,748
Oh don't go Julia, Connie,

1621
01:31:29,773 --> 01:31:32,620
surely you can't drag yourself
away from a happy scene like this.

1622
01:31:32,646 --> 01:31:34,295
Why it's like that thing of Kipling's,

1623
01:31:34,320 --> 01:31:35,777
how does it go now?

1624
01:31:35,980 --> 01:31:37,636
"We left them all in couples,"

1625
01:31:37,893 --> 01:31:39,558
"a-dancing on the decks."

1626
01:31:39,777 --> 01:31:41,519
"We left the lovers loving,"

1627
01:31:41,956 --> 01:31:43,488
"and their parents signing cheques."

1628
01:31:44,478 --> 01:31:45,993
Write clearly, Clarence.

1629
01:31:46,018 --> 01:31:47,470
The date is June the 14th.

1630
01:31:47,495 --> 01:31:48,749
When?

1631
01:31:48,774 --> 01:31:50,077
What?

1632
01:32:09,416 --> 01:32:10,577
Hello Beach.

1633
01:32:11,070 --> 01:32:12,180
Mr Galahad.

1634
01:32:12,205 --> 01:32:13,586
What have you been up to then?

1635
01:32:13,611 --> 01:32:16,431
I have been paying
a visit to the sty, sir,

1636
01:32:16,456 --> 01:32:19,356
to ascertain that the Empress
had taken no harm

1637
01:32:19,381 --> 01:32:22,349
from her disturbed evening.

1638
01:32:22,374 --> 01:32:24,705
- Remorse, eh?
- Sir?

1639
01:32:24,730 --> 01:32:27,892
Needed more than one to get
that porker in the car.

1640
01:32:27,917 --> 01:32:30,806
Don't worry Beach, 
your secret is safe with me.

1641
01:32:30,831 --> 01:32:32,577
You have fought the good fight.

1642
01:32:32,602 --> 01:32:34,273
I hope they kissed you.

1643
01:32:34,562 --> 01:32:37,680
The young lady did, sir.

1644
01:32:38,962 --> 01:32:40,110
Good night Beach.

1645
01:32:40,430 --> 01:32:41,602
Good night, sir.

1646
01:32:44,125 --> 01:32:45,515
Let me out!

1647
01:32:47,234 --> 01:32:48,523
Please!

1648
01:32:48,548 --> 01:32:50,562
Someone let me out!

1649
01:32:52,117 --> 01:32:54,609
Let me out!
