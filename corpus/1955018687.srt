00:20:46,112 --> 00:20:48,448
And didn't lose my number
or anything.

382
00:20:48,515 --> 00:20:51,318
Well, look who's excited.

383
00:20:51,384 --> 00:20:52,319
Yeah.

384
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:53,753
Where are you?

385
00:20:53,820 --> 00:20:56,155
I'm, uh,
I'm in the alley of a bar.

386
00:20:56,222 --> 00:20:57,490
Yeah?

387
00:20:57,557 --> 00:20:59,359
Are you all alone?

388
00:20:59,426 --> 00:21:01,861
Y-yeah.

389
00:21:01,928 --> 00:21:03,262
Good.

390
00:21:03,330 --> 00:21:06,499
I was hoping you would be.

391
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:08,000
Um, can you speak up?

392
00:21:08,067 --> 00:21:10,102
I can't really
hear you that well.

393
00:21:10,169 --> 00:21:12,305
Uh, I, um, I can't.

394
00:21:12,372 --> 00:21:15,308
My boyfriend's next door.

395
00:21:15,375 --> 00:21:17,877
Oh.

396
00:21:17,944 --> 00:21:19,712
Um...

397
00:21:19,779 --> 00:21:21,280
Don't worry.

398
00:21:21,348 --> 00:21:25,885
He's not gonna hear us.

399
00:21:25,952 --> 00:21:29,822
I got wet
just dialing your number.

400
00:21:34,861 --> 00:21:37,397
Are you touching yourself?

401
00:21:37,464 --> 00:21:38,731
I am now.

402
00:21:38,798 --> 00:21:42,902
[Door opens,
indistinct chatter]

403
00:21:42,969 --> 00:21:45,004
What about you?

404
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:48,240
Nicole, can you
give me your number?

405
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:49,642
I got to call you back.

406
00:21:49,709 --> 00:21:51,177
You leaving a girl
out in the cold?

407
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:52,178
No.

408
00:21:52,244 --> 00:21:54,246
No, it's nothing like...

409
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:55,348
And I'll call you right back.

410
00:21:55,415 --> 00:21:57,384
I'll call you.

411
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,418
- I call shotgun.
- Sean.

412
00:21:58,485 --> 00:21:59,952
Yeah, that's right.

413
00:22:00,019 --> 00:22:01,688
I don't call shotgun,
'cause I'm driving.

414
00:22:01,754 --> 00:22:05,057
- Sean. Sean.
- What's up, dude?

415
00:22:05,124 --> 00:22:06,359
No.

416
00:22:06,426 --> 00:22:09,328
I wasn't.

417
00:22:09,396 --> 00:22:11,130
What are you doing?

418
00:22:11,197 --> 00:22:15,334
I'm hopefully getting laid.

419
00:22:31,884 --> 00:22:34,186
[Laughs]

420
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:37,490
Your car's a piece of shit.

421
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:39,025
Oh, thank you.

422
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:40,259
[Laughs]

423
00:22:40,326 --> 00:22:42,261
Come on.

424
00:22:42,328 --> 00:22:44,063
Yeah, no, I got the door.

[Cell phone rings]

426
00:22:59,512 --> 00:23:00,980
Hello?

427
00:23:01,047 --> 00:23:03,282
Hi.

428
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:05,918
Hi.

429
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:07,319
Davy?

430
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:08,721
Yeah?

431
00:23:08,788 --> 00:23:11,891
I'm ready to fuck.

432
00:23:11,958 --> 00:23:14,260
Okay.

433

[Both moaning]

434
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,000
Thanks for that, babe.

435
00:23:21,067 --> 00:23:25,104
Oh, thank you.

436
00:23:25,171 --> 00:23:29,275
Oh, my God.

437
00:23:29,341 --> 00:23:30,577
Really soon.

438
00:23:30,643 --> 00:23:33,613
Wait.
You're all about sex.

439
00:23:33,680 --> 00:23:36,115
Can't we talk a little bit?

440
00:23:36,182 --> 00:23:38,284
You know, like, cuddle?

441
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:39,686
Okay.

442
00:23:39,752 --> 00:23:42,421
Um, what do you
want to talk about?

443
00:23:42,489 --> 00:23:43,956
I don't care.

444
00:23:44,023 --> 00:23:47,827
Anything.

445
00:23:47,894 --> 00:23:52,899
What do you think
I look like?

446
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:54,934
Um...

447
00:23:55,001 --> 00:24:00,707
I think you have long hair,

448
00:24:00,773 --> 00:24:02,809
And it's strawberry blonde.

449
00:24:02,875 --> 00:24:04,544
And you have brown eyes

450
00:24:04,611 --> 00:24:07,547
And big, red lips.

451
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:08,648
Am I close?

[Laughs]

453
00:24:10,349 --> 00:24:14,320
No comment.

454
00:24:14,386 --> 00:24:16,856
Well, what about me?

455
00:24:16,923 --> 00:24:20,059
What do you think
I look like?

456
00:24:21,528 --> 00:24:23,596
Uh...

457
00:24:23,663 --> 00:24:26,465
Well, you're white.

458
00:24:26,533 --> 00:24:28,000
Pale, maybe.

459
00:24:28,067 --> 00:24:29,335
Uh-huh.

460
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:30,670
Short hair.

461
00:24:30,737 --> 00:24:33,305
You could say that.

462
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:35,341
Blue eyes.

463
00:24:35,407 --> 00:24:36,676
They're green.

464
00:24:36,743 --> 00:24:40,012
But close to blue.

465
00:24:40,079 --> 00:24:41,480
Tall.

466
00:24:41,548 --> 00:24:43,850
You're handsome.

467
00:24:43,916 --> 00:24:47,453
Very strong features.

468
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,523
And nice arms.

469
00:24:50,590 --> 00:24:54,627
All that from my voice?

470
00:24:54,694 --> 00:24:57,229
Well, am I right?

00:24:57,296 --> 00:25:00,199

So do you really
have a boyfriend?

474
00:25:08,908 --> 00:25:10,309
We're not that serious.

475
00:25:10,376 --> 00:25:13,312
Don't worry.

476
00:25:13,379 --> 00:25:16,448
Well, it kind of feels
like we are.

477
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:20,219
You could hardly call him
my boyfriend, Davy.

478
00:25:20,286 --> 00:25:21,854
We just fuck.

479
00:25:21,921 --> 00:25:24,190
Well then why aren't you
with him right now

480
00:25:24,256 --> 00:25:27,059
Rather than pretending
to be with me?

481
00:25:27,126 --> 00:25:28,861
Because.

482
00:25:28,928 --> 00:25:32,298
I like this better.

483
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:36,703
So, Davy,
why are you phone fucking me

484
00:25:36,769 --> 00:25:40,306
In the middle of the night?

485
00:25:40,372 --> 00:25:42,742
And partly?

486
00:25:42,809 --> 00:25:45,678
Because
I like it better too.

487
00:25:49,148 --> 00:25:52,484
I've been on the road
for the last couple months.

488
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:53,485
Oh.

489
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:54,486
Are you in a band?

490
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:56,222
Uh, no.

491
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:57,757
Not nearly as exciting.

492
00:25:57,824 --> 00:26:00,893
It's, uh, a book tour.

493
00:26:00,960 --> 00:26:03,295
I knew you were
an intellectual.

494
00:26:03,362 --> 00:26:05,431
What does that mean?

495
00:26:05,497 --> 00:26:08,400
It was just...

496
00:26:08,467 --> 00:26:09,836
In your voice.

497
00:26:09,902 --> 00:26:11,838
I feel like I can hardly

498
00:26:11,904 --> 00:26:13,740
Consider myself
an intellectual.

in the back of a station wagon

In a parking lot
in new Mexico

501
00:26:20,346 --> 00:26:23,015
Doesn't really qualify.

502
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:26,986
Well,
when you put it that way...

503
00:26:27,053 --> 00:26:31,057
So how old are you?

504
00:26:31,123 --> 00:26:32,224
I'm 28.

505
00:26:32,291 --> 00:26:33,225
Me too.

506
00:26:33,292 --> 00:26:35,261
Really?

507
00:26:39,732 --> 00:26:41,467
Where do you work?

508
00:26:41,533 --> 00:26:43,469
I'm a secretary

509
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:45,604
At a funeral home.

510
00:26:45,672 --> 00:26:47,707
Wow.

511
00:26:47,774 --> 00:26:49,108
That must be...

512
00:26:49,175 --> 00:26:51,844
That sounds
like a good job.

513
00:26:51,911 --> 00:26:54,180
It's really sad.

514
00:26:54,246 --> 00:26:57,016
Actually,
I have to sort of

515
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:58,450
Disconnect myself
from it all

516
00:26:58,517 --> 00:26:59,752
To even deal with it.

517
00:26:59,819 --> 00:27:01,587
Yeah,
now that I think about it,

518
00:27:01,654 --> 00:27:04,023
It could be depressing.

519
00:27:04,090 --> 00:27:06,125
Yeah.

520
00:27:06,192 --> 00:27:10,329
My mom, she, um,
she died last year.

521
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:11,898
We were really close.

522
00:27:11,964 --> 00:27:15,367
Oh, I'm... I'm very
sorry to hear that.

523
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:17,103
It was hard.

524
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:19,371
I set the whole
funeral up at work.

525
00:27:19,438 --> 00:27:22,341
It was just...

526
00:27:22,408 --> 00:27:24,243
I should quit.

527
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:26,813
- That's...
- Really, I should.

528
00:27:26,879 --> 00:27:28,380
I should just...

529
00:27:28,447 --> 00:27:29,849
You know what?

530
00:27:29,916 --> 00:27:31,450
I think you should.

531
00:27:31,517 --> 00:27:32,785

534
00:27:38,157 --> 00:27:40,259
I got to get going, though.

535
00:27:40,326 --> 00:27:42,428
That night
that you called me?

536
00:27:42,494 --> 00:27:44,030
Yeah?

537
00:27:44,096 --> 00:27:47,934
How'd you know
I was gonna be there?

538
00:27:48,000 --> 00:27:52,604
I mean,
what made you call me?

539
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,041
I didn't.

540
00:27:55,107 --> 00:27:57,944
I just needed someone
to be with.

541
00:27:58,010 --> 00:28:01,914
I called a random number,
and...

542
00:28:01,981 --> 00:28:04,817
There you were.

543
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:12,058
Good night, Davy.

544
00:28:12,124 --> 00:28:15,261
Good night, Nicole.

545
00:28:45,191 --> 00:28:48,460
So, Josie,
did my brother tell you

546
00:28:48,527 --> 00:28:50,797
About his girlfriend?

547
00:28:53,432 --> 00:28:55,467
No.

548
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:08,948
- That's for me.
- I don't need that.

549
00:29:09,015 --> 00:29:11,483
For you too.

550
00:29:15,587 --> 00:29:16,522
There you go.

551
00:29:16,588 --> 00:29:17,723
Okay, yeah.

552
00:29:17,790 --> 00:29:19,826
I'll just...
See you later.

00:29:53,725 --> 00:29:55,561
You been acting
like such a fuckin' brat

556
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,864
Since the minute
that we hit the road.

557
00:29:57,930 --> 00:29:59,298
I'm getting sick of it.

558
00:29:59,365 --> 00:30:00,699
Oh,
you're getting sick of it?

559
00:30:00,766 --> 00:30:04,971
What?

560
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:08,240
At least I have a girlfriend
to cheat on.

561
00:30:08,307 --> 00:30:11,743
You just made a joke
of this whole thing.

562
00:30:11,810 --> 00:30:14,513
You're just doing this,

563
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:16,148
To fuck girls.

564
00:30:16,215 --> 00:30:18,417
What is so wrong
with that, dude?

565
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:19,952
Oh, I'm sorry!

566
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:21,253
I'm not gonna
fuck girls anymore.

567
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:24,123
You know what I'm gonna do?

568
00:30:24,190 --> 00:30:25,757

so well for me.

You don't have to be
that hard on yourself, Davy.

01:00:01,766 --> 01:00:04,434
Two truths and a lie.

1126
01:00:04,501 --> 01:00:06,336
One...

1127
01:00:06,403 --> 01:00:10,274
I'm very much in love
with my boyfriend.

1128
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,475
Aw.

1129
01:00:11,541 --> 01:00:12,609
[Laughter]

1130
01:00:12,677 --> 01:00:14,011
That's a lie.

1131
01:00:14,078 --> 01:00:14,879
Two...

1132
01:00:14,945 --> 01:00:17,381
Um, I've been to India once.

1133
01:00:17,447 --> 01:00:20,818
And, three,
I've made out with a girl.

1134
01:00:20,885 --> 01:00:22,252
I know this one.

1135
01:00:22,319 --> 01:00:24,188
That's not fair.
You're out this round.

1136
01:00:24,254 --> 01:00:27,825
Uh, two... two or three?

1137
01:00:27,892 --> 01:00:29,827
Two's the lie.

1138
01:00:29,894 --> 01:00:31,662
We go with two.

1139
01:00:31,729 --> 01:00:33,030
Really? You ready?

1140
01:00:33,097 --> 01:00:34,098
Yeah.

1141
01:00:34,164 --> 01:00:35,432
Nope.

1142
01:00:35,499 --> 01:00:36,500
I was India when I was seven.

1143
01:00:36,566 --> 01:00:38,869
Du-dum.

1144
01:00:38,936 --> 01:00:40,337
Is it nice there?

1145
01:00:40,404 --> 01:00:42,572
Really? You've never
kissed a girl? Really?

1146
01:00:42,639 --> 01:00:45,542
No.

1147
01:00:45,609 --> 01:00:48,112
Do we want to fix
this little problem right now?

1148
01:00:48,178 --> 01:00:50,514
No, I think we're fine.

1149
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:53,383
Okay.

1150
01:00:53,450 --> 01:00:55,519
It's your turn.

1151
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:56,687
How about I go last?

1152
01:00:56,754 --> 01:01:00,825
I'll go last.

1153
01:01:00,891 --> 01:01:02,259
No.
I'm gonna do you right now.

1154
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:03,928
Nice.

1155
01:01:03,994 --> 01:01:05,229
Sick.
That's really sick.

1156
01:01:05,295 --> 01:01:08,265
Thank you.

1157
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:14,104
Davy still has
his baby blanket.

1158
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:16,073
And he calls it Shirley.

1159
01:01:16,140 --> 01:01:18,909
He likes embarrassing me.

1160
01:01:18,976 --> 01:01:21,045
Well, now we know.

1161
01:01:21,111 --> 01:01:23,347
Okay.

1162
01:01:23,413 --> 01:01:24,681
So we're gonna
get rid of that.

1163
01:01:24,749 --> 01:01:25,983
Ah, uh, ugh, okay.

1164
01:01:26,050 --> 01:01:27,184
I'm starting over.

1165
01:01:27,251 --> 01:01:29,453
One. Um...

1166
01:01:29,519 --> 01:01:30,921
You'll like this.

1167
01:01:30,988 --> 01:01:32,857
Davy's first word was,

1168
01:01:32,923 --> 01:01:34,859
And I quote,
"interesting."

1169
01:01:34,925 --> 01:01:37,895
Wait, that's, like,
four or five syllables.

1170
01:01:37,962 --> 01:01:40,731
I know.

1171
01:01:40,798 --> 01:01:42,399
It's four syllables.

1172
01:01:42,466 --> 01:01:45,903
Okay, okay.

1173
01:01:45,970 --> 01:01:46,971
Once in junior high school.

1174
01:01:47,037 --> 01:01:48,505
- Sean.
- Jesus. Sean.

1175
01:01:48,572 --> 01:01:51,075
- A guy? Really?
- No, it wasn't a real kiss.

1176
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:53,243
It was a dare,
and he was my best friend.

1177
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:54,912
Sean, you know.
You were there.

1178
01:01:54,979 --> 01:01:56,646
He was the one daring me.

1179
01:01:56,713 --> 01:01:57,982
Yes, it was a fake kiss.

1180
01:01:58,048 --> 01:01:59,083
It was a fake kiss.

1181
01:01:59,149 --> 01:02:00,918
It was just a prank.

1182
01:02:00,985 --> 01:02:02,586
Hey, you embarrassed me.

1183
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:05,355
Are you happy?

1184
01:02:05,422 --> 01:02:08,525
Just let's play
a different game.

1185
01:02:08,592 --> 01:02:11,428
Well, no, I mean, one more.
One more.

1186
01:02:11,495 --> 01:02:13,864
- Yeah, it's only fair.
- You're doing great.

1187
01:02:13,931 --> 01:02:16,133
Number three.

1188
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:26,010
Number three...

1189
01:02:26,076 --> 01:02:27,778
Yeah, royally.

1190
01:02:27,845 --> 01:02:31,849
All right, so I'm just gonna
give you guys the third truth.

1191
01:02:31,916 --> 01:02:34,218
Sorry, dude.

1192
01:02:34,284 --> 01:02:35,886
While we were
on our road trip,

1193
01:02:35,953 --> 01:02:38,555
Um, Davy had this,
like, really fucked up

1194
01:02:38,622 --> 01:02:39,890
Phone sex relationship

1195
01:02:39,957 --> 01:02:41,258
With this girl
that he never met

1196
01:02:41,325 --> 01:02:43,627
Named Nicole.

1197
01:02:43,693 --> 01:02:45,295
You're such a prick.

1198
01:02:45,362 --> 01:02:47,564
Oh, no, come on.
Don't be shy.

1199
01:02:47,631 --> 01:02:49,433
There's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

1200
01:02:49,499 --> 01:02:50,968
It's okay.

1201
01:02:51,035 --> 01:02:53,170
No,
you've got me curious now.

1202
01:02:53,237 --> 01:02:54,805
It was...
It was a stupid thing.

1203
01:02:54,872 --> 01:02:56,173
Come on, Davy.

1204
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:58,008
We don't have to...
Let's uh...

1205
01:02:58,075 --> 01:02:59,877
I don't... i don't want
to talk about it, okay?

1206
01:02:59,944 --> 01:03:04,014
It was stupid, and...

1207
01:03:06,984 --> 01:03:09,253
Thanks for that, Sean.

1208
01:03:09,319 --> 01:03:11,856
You know what?

1209
01:03:11,922 --> 01:03:13,723
It's my turn now.

1210
01:03:13,790 --> 01:03:14,758
I just did you.

1211
01:03:14,825 --> 01:03:16,393
No, I want to do you.

1212
01:03:16,460 --> 01:03:17,494
I just did you, Davy.

1213
01:03:17,561 --> 01:03:18,795
No, I'm gonna do you,

1214
01:03:18,863 --> 01:03:20,530
And I get three truths too.

1215
01:03:20,597 --> 01:03:21,932
So sit down, Sean.

1216
01:03:21,999 --> 01:03:23,267
All right,
now it's a game.

1217
01:03:23,333 --> 01:03:28,405
Let's do it.

1218
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:30,207
Okay, let... let me think
here for a second.

1219
01:03:30,274 --> 01:03:32,409
Davy, make it good.
Get him.

1220
01:03:32,476 --> 01:03:34,244
Okay. Um...

1221
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:36,680
Okay, first, um,
when we were kids,

1222
01:03:36,746 --> 01:03:39,583
We were sleeping over
at this friends of ours' house,

1223
01:03:39,649 --> 01:03:42,819
And Sean pissed in his sleep.

1224
01:03:42,887 --> 01:03:46,590
It gets worse.

1225
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:49,226
And so we had
to call our parents

1226
01:03:49,293 --> 01:03:50,995
To come get us
in the middle of the night.

1227
01:03:51,061 --> 01:03:53,297
And he, um,
he pissed so much

1228
01:03:53,363 --> 01:03:55,765
That, uh, they couldn't even
clean the couch.

1229
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:58,768
Our family just had to buy
a new one for 'em, so...

1230
01:03:58,835 --> 01:04:00,070
Oh.

1231
01:04:00,137 --> 01:04:02,039
Okay, number... number two.

1232
01:04:02,106 --> 01:04:04,074
The first thing
Sean ever jerked...

1233
01:04:04,141 --> 01:04:06,376
He masturbated to,

1234
01:04:06,443 --> 01:04:10,147
Was a breast cancer
self-exam pamphlet.

1235
01:04:10,214 --> 01:04:12,582
I'm not even gonna ask

1236
01:04:12,649 --> 01:04:15,619
That's pretty amazing.

1237
01:04:15,685 --> 01:04:16,853
It was really...

1238
01:04:16,921 --> 01:04:17,854
So wrong.

1239
01:04:17,922 --> 01:04:19,223
Yeah.

1240
01:04:19,289 --> 01:04:21,325
Number three, um,

1241
01:04:21,391 --> 01:04:24,094
When we were on our road trip,

1242
01:04:24,161 --> 01:04:29,499
One night, Sean, um...

1243
01:04:29,566 --> 01:04:33,403
Well, we were at this bar,
and, uh...

1244
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:36,040
Well, it's not really
that embarrassing,

1245
01:04:36,106 --> 01:04:38,342
But it's the truth,
at least.

1246
01:04:38,408 --> 01:04:40,978
- No, tell us.
- Yeah, yeah.

1247
01:04:41,045 --> 01:04:44,348
We were at this bar,
and there...

1248
01:04:44,414 --> 01:04:46,116
We were talking
to a bunch of college kids,

1249
01:04:46,183 --> 01:04:49,353
And there was
this really drunk girl,

1250
01:04:49,419 --> 01:04:52,056
And we were drinking,
of course,

1251
01:04:52,122 --> 01:04:56,961
And, um, there...

1252
01:04:58,562 --> 01:05:01,365
Sean was so drunk
that he threw up all over,

1253
01:05:01,431 --> 01:05:05,035
And I had to carry him
out of the bar.

1254
01:05:05,102 --> 01:05:06,536
That's really disgusting,
Sean.

1255
01:05:06,603 --> 01:05:10,407
It wasn't really a good one.
I'm sorry.

1256
01:05:10,474 --> 01:05:12,943
Hey.

1257
01:05:13,010 --> 01:05:15,712
Uh, well, let's play, uh,

1258
01:05:15,779 --> 01:05:17,414
Let's play
scattergories or something.

1259
01:05:17,481 --> 01:05:18,815
I don't know.
That would be fun.

1260
01:05:18,882 --> 01:05:21,918
I'll... okay, I'll go quick.

1261
01:05:21,986 --> 01:05:23,053
Okay.

1262
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,754
Uh, okay, one,

1263
01:05:24,821 --> 01:05:29,659
I...Have, um...

1264
01:05:29,726 --> 01:05:30,660
I said I would be quick.

1265
01:05:30,727 --> 01:05:31,661
Okay, one...

1266
01:05:31,728 --> 01:05:33,263
[Laughter]

1267
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:39,403
Um, I have been locked
in a public bathroom overnight.

1268
01:05:39,469 --> 01:05:42,872
Two,
I have had sex in public.

1269
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,542
Three...

1270
01:05:45,609 --> 01:05:48,945
Three.

1271
01:05:49,013 --> 01:05:50,747
Three, there's someone
in this room

1272
01:05:50,814 --> 01:05:53,950
I'd very much
like to kiss again tonight.

1273
01:05:54,018 --> 01:05:56,420
All right.

1274
01:05:56,486 --> 01:05:57,821
Oh, hey, no!
[Laughter]

1275
01:05:57,887 --> 01:05:59,389
No, stay away from me.

1276
01:05:59,456 --> 01:06:01,691
Save me.
Don't let him near me.

1277
01:06:01,758 --> 01:06:03,160
Yeah.

1278
01:06:03,227 --> 01:06:04,261
He's gonna get it tonight

1279
01:06:04,328 --> 01:06:05,829
When we go home.

1280
01:06:05,895 --> 01:06:06,863
I am totally insulted now.

1281
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:08,598
Thank you very much.

1282
01:06:08,665 --> 01:06:10,334
That's it. I'm out.
I'm sure you're lovely.

1283
01:06:10,400 --> 01:06:13,703
Thank you guys for coming,
though.

1284
01:06:13,770 --> 01:06:16,573
A wonderful evening.

1285
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:17,507
This was beautiful.

1286
01:06:17,574 --> 01:06:20,210
- We'll talk.
- Okay.

1287
01:06:20,277 --> 01:06:21,511
Oh, I'll walk you out.

1288
01:06:21,578 --> 01:06:22,979
Let's get
your jackets and stuff.

1289
01:06:23,047 --> 01:06:25,182
Bye, Sarah.

1290
01:06:25,249 --> 01:06:26,516
Sure you guys
don't want to do this?

1291
01:06:26,583 --> 01:06:29,519
Get out of here.
You're awful.

1292
01:06:37,394 --> 01:06:41,265
Okay.

1293
01:06:41,331 --> 01:06:43,567
It was stupid, really.

1294
01:06:43,633 --> 01:06:45,569
Well,
do you still talk to her?

1295
01:06:45,635 --> 01:06:48,305
Nah, we don't really
talk anymore.

1296
01:06:48,372 --> 01:06:49,939
We didn't really talk much
to begin with.

1297
01:06:50,006 --> 01:06:54,478
Sean likes to make a big deal
out of those things.

1298
01:06:54,544 --> 01:06:57,114
What about that bathroom story
you were starting to tell?

1299
01:06:57,181 --> 01:06:58,715
What happened?

1300
01:06:58,782 --> 01:07:01,285
Uh, it was at work.

1301
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:07,691

Uh, Davy.

1488
01:17:56,072 --> 01:17:57,974
I could either
meet you, or, uh...

1489
01:17:58,041 --> 01:18:00,810
- Davy, listen.
- If...

1490
01:18:00,877 --> 01:18:02,145
Yeah?

1491
01:18:02,211 --> 01:18:05,148
I can't make it tonight.

1492
01:18:07,751 --> 01:18:09,652
What?

1493
01:18:09,719 --> 01:18:11,487
I'm sorry.

1494
01:18:11,554 --> 01:18:14,924
Something's come up.

1495
01:18:17,226 --> 01:18:20,063
Say something.

1496
01:18:20,129 --> 01:18:21,697
I don't understand.

1497
01:18:21,765 --> 01:18:23,900
I came here to see you.

1498
01:18:23,967 --> 01:18:26,602
That's the only reason
why I came here.

1499
01:18:26,669 --> 01:18:28,772
Could we meet tomorrow?

1500
01:18:28,838 --> 01:18:32,942
Would that be okay?

1501
01:18:33,009 --> 01:18:35,845
I leave tomorrow, Nicole.

1502
01:18:35,912 --> 01:18:37,847
Let's meet at 2:00.

1503
01:18:37,914 --> 01:18:39,348
That'll give us enough time.

1504
01:18:39,415 --> 01:18:41,751
There's this place
off the highway.

1505
01:18:41,818 --> 01:18:47,223
Um, it's called
fairweathers.

1506
01:18:47,290 --> 01:18:48,491
Okay.

1507
01:18:48,557 --> 01:18:50,459
Okay. I'll be there.

1508
01:18:50,526 --> 01:18:52,095
Bye.

1509
01:18:52,161 --> 01:18:55,999
Bye.

1510
01:19:20,089 --> 01:19:21,390
- Hi.
- Hi.

1511
01:19:21,457 --> 01:19:22,458
Table for one?

1512
01:19:22,525 --> 01:19:24,227
I'm supposed
to meet a friend.

1513
01:19:24,293 --> 01:19:25,628
I don't know
if she's here yet.

1514
01:19:25,694 --> 01:19:26,695
Oh, okay.

1515
01:19:26,762 --> 01:19:27,797
Well, it doesn't really look

1516
01:19:27,864 --> 01:19:29,198
Like there's anybody waiting,

1517
01:19:29,265 --> 01:19:31,700
But you're welcome
to take a look around.

1518
01:19:31,767 --> 01:19:34,537
Thank you.

1519
01:19:41,510 --> 01:19:44,247
I think I'm gonna
have a seat at the bar.

1520
01:19:44,313 --> 01:19:47,984
If, um, if anyone comes in
asking for Davy Mitchell...

1521
01:19:48,051 --> 01:19:49,352
Mm-hmm.

1522
01:19:49,418 --> 01:19:50,319
That's me.

1523
01:19:50,386 --> 01:19:51,320
Okay. Will do.

1524
01:19:51,387 --> 01:19:53,256
Thanks.

1525
01:20:16,412 --> 01:20:17,813
Nicole?

1526
01:20:17,881 --> 01:20:20,483
No, sorry.

1527
01:20:20,549 --> 01:20:22,218
John?

1528
01:20:22,285 --> 01:20:24,553
No.

1529
01:20:24,620 --> 01:20:27,056
Yeah.

1530
01:20:32,561 --> 01:20:35,431
Are you sure no one's
come in and asked for me?

1531
01:20:35,498 --> 01:20:37,901
No, no one's come in.

1532
01:20:42,972 --> 01:20:45,441
Davy?

1533
01:20:55,751 --> 01:20:58,054
Hi.

1534
01:21:04,460 --> 01:21:06,562
I'm Aaron.

1535
01:21:12,101 --> 01:21:15,404
It's nice
to finally meet you.

1536
01:21:21,677 --> 01:21:24,880
Is it okay if we, um...

1537
01:21:24,948 --> 01:21:27,951
Go and sit down?

1538
01:21:28,017 --> 01:21:30,453
Please?

1539
01:21:43,699 --> 01:21:44,633
Hi.

1540
01:21:44,700 --> 01:21:45,634
Hi.

1541
01:21:45,701 --> 01:21:47,436
Two?

1542
01:21:47,503 --> 01:21:49,505
Yeah.

1543
01:22:00,383 --> 01:22:04,187
Uh, do you mind if we
have, like, a corner booth?

1544
01:22:04,253 --> 01:22:05,921
No, of course.

1545
01:22:05,989 --> 01:22:08,624
Thank you.

1546
01:22:19,969 --> 01:22:22,471
How's this?

1547
01:22:22,538 --> 01:22:25,074
This is fine.
Thank you.

1548
01:22:26,675 --> 01:22:29,145
Your waitress should be
with you in a moment.

1549
01:22:29,212 --> 01:22:30,379
Thank you.

1550
01:22:30,446 --> 01:22:34,283
Thanks.

1551
01:22:40,489 --> 01:22:42,625
She was nice.

1552
01:22:52,568 --> 01:22:55,204
I'm sorry, Davy.

1553
01:22:55,271 --> 01:22:58,407
Yesterday, i...

1554
01:22:58,474 --> 01:23:02,978
I just thought
a nice place would...

1555
01:23:03,046 --> 01:23:04,180
It's...

1556
01:23:04,247 --> 01:23:08,551
It's not easy being here.

1557
01:23:08,617 --> 01:23:11,954
I just...

1558
01:23:12,021 --> 01:23:15,424
This is embarrassing.

1559
01:23:22,931 --> 01:23:26,169
D-do you mind if...?

1560
01:23:26,235 --> 01:23:28,504
Do you...?

1561
01:23:39,014 --> 01:23:39,982
I'm sorry, i...

1562
01:23:40,049 --> 01:23:41,584
I really...

1563
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:43,586
Really, really am.

1564
01:23:43,652 --> 01:23:45,354
It's okay.

1565
01:23:45,421 --> 01:23:48,157
You can stop apologizing.

1566
01:23:54,230 --> 01:23:55,498
Hi, you two.

1567
01:23:55,564 --> 01:23:56,299
I'm Amanda.

1568
01:23:56,365 --> 01:24:01,204
Hi, Amanda.

1569
01:24:01,270 --> 01:24:02,671
- Um, water.
- Okay.

1570
01:24:02,738 --> 01:24:03,972
Glass of water.
Thank you.

1571
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:07,643
And you?

1572
01:24:07,710 --> 01:24:09,678
I'll have that
right up for you.

1573
01:24:09,745 --> 01:24:11,447
Could you bring two?

1574
01:24:11,514 --> 01:24:15,184
Sure.

1575
01:24:15,251 --> 01:24:17,520
That bad, huh?

1576
01:24:29,698 --> 01:24:33,602
So, uh...

1577
01:24:33,669 --> 01:24:38,107
Am I the first one
you talked to?

1578
01:24:38,174 --> 01:24:40,543
As Nicole?

1579
01:24:50,219 --> 01:24:53,088
Why do you do this?

1580
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:57,693
I don't know.

1581
01:25:02,365 --> 01:25:04,267
I was 13.

1582
01:25:04,333 --> 01:25:06,369
The first time.

1583
01:25:06,435 --> 01:25:10,239
And there was this guy.

1584
01:25:10,306 --> 01:25:15,844
I was just
starting high school.

1585
01:25:15,911 --> 01:25:21,150
And I had a crush on him.

1586
01:25:21,217 --> 01:25:22,651
He was the first...

1587
01:25:22,718 --> 01:25:25,621
First guy
that I actually felt...

1588
01:25:25,688 --> 01:25:29,792
Something for.

1589
01:25:29,858 --> 01:25:31,460
I mean, it was...

1590
01:25:31,527 --> 01:25:33,128
All new and exciting to me,

1591
01:25:33,196 --> 01:25:34,663
And I just...

1592
01:25:34,730 --> 01:25:38,434
I... i couldn't
do anything about it.

1593
01:25:42,371 --> 01:25:46,175
Are y'all ready to order?

1594
01:25:46,242 --> 01:25:47,310
I'm good with drinks for now.

1595
01:25:47,376 --> 01:25:50,613
- Okay.
- Thank you.

1596
01:25:50,679 --> 01:25:53,382
Thank you.

1597
01:25:56,084 --> 01:25:57,753
Do you mind if i...?

1598
01:25:57,820 --> 01:26:00,223
Oh, no.

1599
01:26:03,091 --> 01:26:05,994
Thank you.

1600
01:26:06,061 --> 01:26:09,031
S-so...

1601
01:26:09,097 --> 01:26:11,767
I called him one night.

1602
01:26:11,834 --> 01:26:13,168
Jesse.

1603
01:26:13,236 --> 01:26:19,141
And I, um,
put on a girl voice,

1604
01:26:19,208 --> 01:26:22,911
And pretended I was one

1605
01:26:22,978 --> 01:26:26,181
Of the cheerleaders
from school,

1606
01:26:26,249 --> 01:26:28,751
Nicole.

1607
01:26:31,119 --> 01:26:33,522
And it worked.

1608
01:26:33,589 --> 01:26:37,059
He actually talked to me.

1609
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:39,194
Thinking I was her.

1610
01:26:41,664 --> 01:26:43,732
So you just kept it going?

1611
01:26:43,799 --> 01:26:46,201
I just
got into the habit of it.

1612
01:26:46,269 --> 01:26:48,271
And i... eventually,

1613
01:26:48,337 --> 01:26:52,007
I just got really good
at the voice.

1614
01:26:52,074 --> 01:26:54,643
That's for sure.

1615
01:26:58,281 --> 01:27:00,949
How long do they last?

1616
01:27:02,150 --> 01:27:04,553
Well, um...

1617
01:27:04,620 --> 01:27:07,356
Sometimes it's just one call.

1618
01:27:07,423 --> 01:27:12,995
Um, other times
it's a few days, a few months.

1619
01:27:13,061 --> 01:27:16,164
One guy lasted a few years.

1620
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:18,233
Sometimes it's...

1621
01:27:18,301 --> 01:27:20,068
Just sex.

1622
01:27:20,135 --> 01:27:23,772
Sometimes it's...

1623
01:27:23,839 --> 01:27:27,376
It's more.

1624
01:27:28,744 --> 01:27:32,615
Either way,
they mostly ended up

1625
01:27:32,681 --> 01:27:35,384
Flaring out at the end.

1626
01:27:35,451 --> 01:27:39,722
So I ended up, um,

1627
01:27:39,788 --> 01:27:42,190
Keeping, like, a couple
of guys going at once.

1628
01:27:42,257 --> 01:27:45,361
You mean you've been
cheating on me this whole time?

1629
01:27:45,428 --> 01:27:48,397
[Laughter]

1630
01:27:48,464 --> 01:27:51,667
No.

1631
01:28:07,082 --> 01:28:09,084
So how do you keep them going?

1632
01:28:09,151 --> 01:28:11,487
Why do they keep
taking your calls?

1633
01:28:11,554 --> 01:28:12,555
Why did you?

1634
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:16,725
Boredom, mostly.

1635
01:28:18,494 --> 01:28:20,429
Oh.

1636
01:28:24,232 --> 01:28:26,234
So you come here a lot?

1637
01:28:26,301 --> 01:28:29,037
Hardly ever.

1638
01:28:31,540 --> 01:28:34,176
Is this
where you meet... Guys?

1639
01:28:34,242 --> 01:28:36,379
Nicole guys?

1640
01:28:36,445 --> 01:28:39,247
Yeah, but not many.

1641
01:28:39,314 --> 01:28:43,452
I mean, what's happened?

1642
01:28:43,519 --> 01:28:47,456
Well,
there was, um, one guy,

1643
01:28:47,523 --> 01:28:49,792
He got really,
really angry with me,

1644
01:28:49,858 --> 01:28:51,660
Outside in the parking lot,

1645
01:28:51,727 --> 01:28:55,498
So, um, I got scared,

1646
01:28:55,564 --> 01:28:59,868
So I came in and I waited.

1647
01:28:59,935 --> 01:29:05,207
And eventually he came in
and he sat down with me.

1648
01:29:05,273 --> 01:29:09,845
And what happened after that?

1649
01:29:09,912 --> 01:29:12,448
Uh...

1650
01:29:12,515 --> 01:29:15,150
We went to his, um,

1651
01:29:15,217 --> 01:29:17,786
Motel room, and...

1652
01:29:20,355 --> 01:29:24,126
We had sex.

1653
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:25,628
What?

1654
01:29:25,694 --> 01:29:28,363
I just... i can't...

1655
01:29:28,431 --> 01:29:32,701
I mean,
talking to Nicole, she's...

1656
01:29:32,768 --> 01:29:34,202
You.

1657
01:29:34,269 --> 01:29:36,304
Her, i...

1658
01:29:36,371 --> 01:29:40,175
Was the most sexual person
that I've ever known.

1659
01:29:40,242 --> 01:29:42,077
But you're so shy.

1660
01:29:42,144 --> 01:29:46,415
I don't understand it.

1661
01:29:48,050 --> 01:29:52,020
I've done a lot of things
I'm not proud of.

1662
01:29:54,790 --> 01:29:58,126
Like?

1663
01:29:58,193 --> 01:29:59,127
No.

1664
01:29:59,194 --> 01:30:00,128
I'm not gonna...

1665
01:30:00,195 --> 01:30:01,564
No, come on, Aaron.

1666
01:30:01,630 --> 01:30:04,066
Aaron, you can't do that.

1667
01:30:04,132 --> 01:30:06,401
Just tell me one.

1668
01:30:24,386 --> 01:30:25,320
Okay.

1669
01:30:25,387 --> 01:30:28,891
[Laughter]

1670
01:30:28,957 --> 01:30:33,629
One guy, um...

1671
01:30:33,696 --> 01:30:36,298
Fucked his wife
while I listened.

1672
01:30:36,364 --> 01:30:39,434
She didn't know.

1673
01:30:39,502 --> 01:30:41,236
I don't...

1674
01:30:41,303 --> 01:30:43,338
I don't know why I did it.

1675
01:30:43,405 --> 01:30:46,341
I... i think 'cause I thought
it was gonna be...

1676
01:30:46,408 --> 01:30:49,745
Exciting?

1677
01:30:49,812 --> 01:30:53,115
And he wanted to leave
his wife for Nicole,

1678
01:30:53,181 --> 01:30:58,654
And I just decided
to stop calling him, so...

1679
01:30:58,721 --> 01:31:01,123
When was that?

1680
01:31:01,189 --> 01:31:02,625
That was, like,

1681
01:31:02,691 --> 01:31:05,460
Four years ago.

1682
01:31:05,528 --> 01:31:09,164
Around the same time
my mom died.

1683
01:31:09,231 --> 01:31:11,867
I thought your mom
died last year.

1684
01:31:11,934 --> 01:31:14,770
Yeah, I lie about that.

1685
01:31:15,971 --> 01:31:19,875
I really like talking
about her with people,

1686
01:31:19,942 --> 01:31:23,278
But I think
they would think I was weird

1687
01:31:23,345 --> 01:31:25,781
If they find out
it was four years ago

1688
01:31:25,848 --> 01:31:31,253
And I still
can't get over it.

1689
01:31:31,319 --> 01:31:34,790
Do you really work
in a funeral home?

1690
01:31:34,857 --> 01:31:37,726
Unfortunately,
that's true.

1691
01:31:42,330 --> 01:31:45,333
You see that woman
over there?

1692
01:31:45,400 --> 01:31:48,604
The blonde one?

1693
01:31:48,671 --> 01:31:49,672
Mm-hmm.

1694
01:31:49,738 --> 01:31:52,107
She was stood up.

1695
01:31:52,174 --> 01:31:53,642
That's so sad.

1696
01:31:53,709 --> 01:31:55,678
When she first came in,

1697
01:31:55,744 --> 01:31:58,781
I thought she was you.

1698
01:31:58,847 --> 01:32:01,416
I'm sure that
would have been a relief.

1699
01:32:01,483 --> 01:32:06,354
Yeah.

1700
01:32:06,421 --> 01:32:08,591
What did you...

1701
01:32:08,657 --> 01:32:11,794
You know, think of

1702
01:32:11,860 --> 01:32:18,200
When you saw her?

1703
01:32:18,266 --> 01:32:21,804
I thought we'd be back
in my hotel room by now.

1704
01:32:22,638 --> 01:32:25,073
Yeah.

1705
01:32:35,250 --> 01:32:37,986
What?

1706
01:32:43,158 --> 01:32:47,029
I don't understand
why you do this.

1707
01:32:47,095 --> 01:32:51,600
I mean,
you're a handsome guy.

1708
01:32:53,902 --> 01:32:55,437
I would think
you would have no trouble

1709
01:32:55,503 --> 01:32:57,405
Finding a guy to be with.

1710
01:32:57,472 --> 01:33:01,176
Thing is, I'd like
to be in a relationship.

1711
01:33:01,243 --> 01:33:02,711
It's just...

1712
01:33:02,778 --> 01:33:06,181
It's just really hard...

1713
01:33:06,248 --> 01:33:08,851
To find something,

1714
01:33:08,917 --> 01:33:11,219
Something so serious.

1715
01:33:11,286 --> 01:33:12,587
I mean,
living here where I do,

1716
01:33:12,655 --> 01:33:13,889
It's...

1717
01:33:13,956 --> 01:33:16,391
I just really don't fit in.

1718
01:33:16,458 --> 01:33:20,162
Maybe I'm looking
in the wrong places.

1719
01:33:20,228 --> 01:33:23,265
You know,
at bars and at clubs.

1720
01:33:23,331 --> 01:33:25,133
You know,
that whole thing.

1721
01:33:25,200 --> 01:33:26,835
But people
just don't seem to get it,

1722
01:33:26,902 --> 01:33:28,470
That... that politeness

1723
01:33:28,536 --> 01:33:31,206
That there is between
a man and a woman,

1724
01:33:31,273 --> 01:33:33,541
You know,
the time right before

1725
01:33:33,608 --> 01:33:35,744
They actually sleep together?

1726
01:33:35,811 --> 01:33:37,412
Like if you see a girl,

1727
01:33:37,479 --> 01:33:40,482
You know right away
if you're gonna,

1728
01:33:40,548 --> 01:33:43,251
You know, fuck her or not.

1729
01:33:43,318 --> 01:33:46,755
But that doesn't mean
you're going to.

1730
01:33:46,822 --> 01:33:48,791
I mean,
you take her to dinner,

1731
01:33:48,857 --> 01:33:51,326
Maybe a couple of times.

1732
01:33:51,393 --> 01:33:54,763
To a movie.

1733
01:33:54,830 --> 01:33:57,232
But no one...

1734
01:34:00,302 --> 01:34:04,006
That's why
it's so much better

1735
01:34:04,072 --> 01:34:06,775
With me on the phone.

1736
01:34:06,842 --> 01:34:11,079
It just works.

1737
01:34:15,984 --> 01:34:16,919
Earlier when I said

1738
01:34:16,985 --> 01:34:17,920
I kept taking your calls

1739
01:34:17,986 --> 01:34:19,988
'Cause I was bored?

1740
01:34:20,055 --> 01:34:23,792
Yeah.

1741
01:34:23,859 --> 01:34:27,062
I was lying.

1742
01:34:33,635 --> 01:34:35,503
I like talking...

1743
01:34:35,570 --> 01:34:39,074
To Nicole.

1744
01:34:53,621 --> 01:34:56,091
It's... it's okay.

1745
01:34:59,627 --> 01:35:01,563
I have to use the bathroom.

1746
01:35:01,629 --> 01:35:03,698
I'll be right back.

1747
01:35:34,830 --> 01:35:37,800
[Sniffs]

1748
01:36:04,759 --> 01:36:06,829
Aaron.

1749
01:37:28,276 --> 01:37:30,712
* I have told

1750
01:37:30,778 --> 01:37:33,949

1751
01:37:34,016 --> 01:37:36,952

* to leave this place

1753
01:37:40,522 --> 01:37:42,925
* we must tie

1754
01:37:42,991 --> 01:37:46,094
* our shoes on tight

1755
01:37:46,161 --> 01:37:48,863
* for the march ahead

1756
01:37:48,931 --> 01:37:52,067
* through sleepy beds

1757
01:37:52,134 --> 01:37:57,739
* and we'll get by

1758
01:37:57,805 --> 01:38:01,643
* and we tell ourselves

1759
01:38:01,709 --> 01:38:04,612
* one more time

1760
01:38:04,679 --> 01:38:10,018
* we get by

1761
01:38:10,085 --> 01:38:13,488
* and we brace ourselves

1762
01:38:13,555 --> 01:38:18,493
* and hold our hands

1763
01:38:18,560 --> 01:38:22,430
* and fight

1764
01:38:42,985 --> 01:38:48,190
* and we'll get by

1765
01:38:48,256 --> 01:38:52,260
* and we tell ourselves

1766
01:38:52,327 --> 01:38:55,463
* one more time

1767
01:38:55,530 --> 01:39:00,668
* we get by

1768
01:39:00,735 --> 01:39:03,338
* and we brace ourselves

1769
01:39:03,405 --> 01:39:08,610
* and we hold our hands

1770
01:39:08,676 --> 01:39:12,614
* and fight

1771
01:39:56,358 --> 01:39:59,927
* yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

1772
01:39:59,994 --> 01:40:02,997
* yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
