We don't stop, we don't try to fix it.
We move.

181
00:15:30,229 --> 00:15:34,375
You know it'll be a long ride if you
just glare at me the whole time.

182
00:15:36,102 --> 00:15:38,771
You know, I don't think
that you would be happy.

183
00:15:38,871 --> 00:15:41,708
I mean, if I get to have a life,
it means you do too.

184
00:15:41,808 --> 00:15:44,043
(CHUCKLES) You're not getting freedom.

185
00:15:44,143 --> 00:15:47,480
We'll we get to Pennsylvania,
my brother will calm down, you'll see.

186
00:15:47,580 --> 00:15:49,882
You'll be in a cage alongside him.

187
00:15:49,982 --> 00:15:52,819
You know, you might want that,
but you're not in charge.

188
00:15:52,919 --> 00:15:54,721
Be quiet.

189
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:13,080
What can I do to make you trust me?

190
00:16:15,675 --> 00:16:18,177
Um... die.

191
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:20,318
Both of you.

192
00:16:47,273 --> 00:16:49,208
MAN: (ON TWO-WAY RADIO)
We're running low up here.

193
00:16:49,308 --> 00:16:51,178
Gonna stop for fuel.

194
00:16:52,211 --> 00:16:53,819
Copy that.

195
00:16:57,016 --> 00:17:01,053
Hey. Hey. Wake up.

196
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,389
We're gonna stop for gas.
Gonna stretch our legs.

197
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:05,691
Okay.

198
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:07,798
I'll just make sure he's calm.

199
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,880
- Let's go. Come on.
- Okay.

200
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:46,370
(DISTORTED WHISPERING)

201
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,122
Hey, you too.

202
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:11,757
No, I'll just stay here.

203
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,693
Oh, no, no, no, you're coming. Come on.

204
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:16,529
Come on!

205
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:20,274
Come on, you little animal.

206
00:18:25,538 --> 00:18:28,274
Listen up... cash-only this trip.
I'm gonna go inside and pay.

207
00:18:28,374 --> 00:18:29,675
Okay.

208
00:18:29,775 --> 00:18:33,145
Zib, it's the last chance to stretch
your legs for a while, okay?

209
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:35,481
I'm gonna just stay here. You go ahead.

210
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:38,217
Really? (LAUGHS)

211
00:18:38,317 --> 00:18:40,255
You wouldn't get far.

212
00:18:41,554 --> 00:18:44,156
Whatever it is you're planning,
I'll stop it.

213
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:47,226
Now whatever pain you inflict,
I'm gonna be sure you feel it

214
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:49,195
a hundred times more, okay?

215
00:18:49,295 --> 00:18:51,973
Tommy, come here! Come here!

216
00:18:55,635 --> 00:18:57,136
Yes, sir?

217
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,905
Look at her.
Look at her and tell me what's wrong.

218
00:18:59,005 --> 00:19:00,840
- She's doing something.
- No kidding.

219
00:19:00,940 --> 00:19:02,174
Whatever.

220
00:19:02,274 --> 00:19:03,575
Hey.

221
00:19:06,278 --> 00:19:08,814
Her hand. She's hiding her hand.

222
00:19:08,914 --> 00:19:10,249
Way to go.

223
00:19:25,998 --> 00:19:29,177
Show me your hand, Zib. Show it to me.

224
00:19:32,538 --> 00:19:36,445
Hey, dude, it's a gas station.

225
00:19:40,012 --> 00:19:41,347
Come on.

226
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:47,958
Empty your pocket.

227
00:19:55,628 --> 00:19:59,671
Oh my God, I'm so sorry. I am so sorry.

228
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,307
What?

229
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:15,148
(DISTORTED WHISPERING)

230
00:20:18,050 --> 00:20:20,486
- Damon.
- No, no, I don't think so. What?

231
00:20:20,586 --> 00:20:22,559
We have to get out of here now.

232
00:20:25,191 --> 00:20:27,259
Damon, now! We need to go now!

233
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:29,228
Go, go. Let's go.

234
00:20:29,328 --> 00:20:30,730
Move out! Let's go!

235
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:33,974
Close that up! Let's get out of here!

236
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:32,525
DAMON: (ON TWO-WAY RADIO)
Everybody okay back there?

237
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:34,827
Yeah, Damon.

238
00:21:34,927 --> 00:21:37,730
Knicks, put Zib on.

239
00:21:37,830 --> 00:21:39,268
Okay.

240
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:42,368
Hey, Damon.

241
00:21:42,468 --> 00:21:43,803
What happened back there?

242
00:21:43,903 --> 00:21:45,471
I didn't see it in time.

243
00:21:45,571 --> 00:21:47,306
You're supposed to be
keeping him under control.

244
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:49,341
There shouldn't have been
anything to see.

245
00:21:49,441 --> 00:21:52,978
Yeah, well, I was distracted.
Knicks was harassing me about my hand.

246
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:54,346
Your hand?

247
00:21:54,446 --> 00:21:55,581
Ask him.

248
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,483
All right. Don't let it happen again.

249
00:21:57,583 --> 00:22:01,262
Why don't you tell Knicks
to let me do my job?

250
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,102
What is it?

251
00:22:16,202 --> 00:22:18,938
I don't know. Could be a fuel pump.

252
00:22:19,038 --> 00:22:21,440
(LOUD BANG)

253
00:22:21,540 --> 00:22:25,177
DAMON: All right, everybody listen up.
We got engine troubles up here.

254
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:29,081
It's gonna take some time to fix it,
so I want everyone to get some rest.

255
00:22:58,878 --> 00:23:00,212
Damn.

256
00:23:00,312 --> 00:23:02,047
What's happening?

257
00:23:02,147 --> 00:23:04,290
His wings are coming back.

258
00:23:07,319 --> 00:23:08,587
Gas station.

259
00:23:08,687 --> 00:23:11,467
The more chaos he causes,
the quicker he heals.

260
00:23:15,728 --> 00:23:17,463
(ROARS)

261
00:23:17,563 --> 00:23:20,599
He's testing the soul. He's only flesh.

262
00:23:20,699 --> 00:23:23,936
Weaken the body, damage the flesh,

263
00:23:24,036 --> 00:23:25,771
you weaken the beast.

264
00:23:25,871 --> 00:23:27,773
There's no reason for this.

265
00:23:27,873 --> 00:23:29,975
I'm sorry, Z,
we can't take a more chances.

266
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:31,547
Give me the key.

267
00:23:32,678 --> 00:23:34,218
Frank, Corley...

268
00:23:36,448 --> 00:23:38,557
give me a moment, then come in.

269
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:56,911
We can feel it, you know,
when you cut us.

270
00:23:58,203 --> 00:23:59,743
This has to be done.

271
00:24:01,373 --> 00:24:03,475
Please, Damon.

272
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:05,718
I can control him.

273
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:15,387
This is the cost of your freedom.

274
00:24:15,487 --> 00:24:18,057
Zib, there's no other way.

275
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:19,959
You need to understand that.

276
00:24:20,993 --> 00:24:22,897
Please don't make me do this.

277
00:24:23,996 --> 00:24:25,297
I can't.

278
00:24:25,397 --> 00:24:26,869
But you will.

279
00:24:28,734 --> 00:24:30,377
MAN: Ready?

280
00:24:43,515 --> 00:24:46,091
(BEAST SNARLS)

281
00:24:48,287 --> 00:24:49,725
Now, Zib.

282
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:53,292
Now!

283
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:00,499
Stop.

284
00:25:09,608 --> 00:25:11,683
(BEAST ROARING)

285
00:25:29,495 --> 00:25:31,172
(KNOCK ON DOOR)

286
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:41,707
Zib...

287
00:25:41,807 --> 00:25:43,042
I need to know that...

288
00:25:43,142 --> 00:25:44,810
I could have controlled him.

289
00:25:44,910 --> 00:25:47,554
No, you couldn't.

290
00:25:51,417 --> 00:25:52,855
And you didn't.

291
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:57,156
Just who I wanted to see.

292
00:25:57,256 --> 00:25:59,491
I was hoping for a moment of your time.

293
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:00,926
DAMON: What do you wanna talk about?

294
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:03,567
KNICKS: Well, Damon, I want to talk
about a lot of things, all right?

295
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:32,559
If we're gonna do this,
you should come inside.

296
00:26:56,381 --> 00:26:58,456
DAMON: Same as before,
my answer hasn't changed.

297
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,453
KNICKS: Beast or man, one shall fall.

298
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:04,556
DAMON: And one rise triumphant
where root first struck earth.

299
00:27:04,656 --> 00:27:07,693
I know the prophesy
as well as you do, Knicks.

300
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:09,902
KNICKS: Then why don't we just end this?

301
00:27:11,096 --> 00:27:14,233
Because I will not be a party to the beast
ascending to infinite power, that's why.

302
00:27:14,333 --> 00:27:16,702
What about his death?
Will you be a party to that?

303
00:27:16,802 --> 00:27:21,840
He killed two dozen of men yesterday,
and you hold the key to his destruction.

304
00:27:21,940 --> 00:27:24,410
If he wins, mankind falls.
What if you're wrong?

305
00:27:24,510 --> 00:27:25,880
PRIEST: He isn't.

306
00:27:27,613 --> 00:27:28,814
You agree with him?

307
00:27:28,914 --> 00:27:30,916
I've been doing this my entire life.

308
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:33,852
I know the scripture
better than any man alive.

309
00:27:33,952 --> 00:27:35,320
And, yes.

310
00:27:35,420 --> 00:27:37,589
I agree with Knicks.

311
00:27:37,689 --> 00:27:41,226
More accurately, I agree with Tito.

312
00:27:41,326 --> 00:27:44,263
So all of this,
all of this is your doing?

313
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:46,732
I'd hope you'd listen
to a unified front.

314
00:27:46,832 --> 00:27:48,901
We have him contained and weakened.

315
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:50,736
We have our whole reliquary in our truck.

316
00:27:50,836 --> 00:27:54,873
If there was ever a time
to do this, it's now.

317
00:27:54,973 --> 00:27:56,542
And what if we're wrong?

318
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:59,378
For 300 years,
the Keepers have been keeping,

319
00:27:59,478 --> 00:28:03,749
and if we don't kill him now,
what was it all for?

320
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:08,454
We give our lives to tread water.

321
00:28:08,554 --> 00:28:11,198
But if you're wrong, Knicks...

322
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:18,297
Well, I will have done something.

323
00:28:18,397 --> 00:28:20,438
I will, at the very least, have tried.

324
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:29,608
So I'll tell the men
about our change in destination.

325
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,110
Wait.

326
00:28:31,210 --> 00:28:34,079
Let me tell Zib.
She's not gonna like this.

327
00:28:34,179 --> 00:28:35,814
There's one last thing.

328
00:28:35,914 --> 00:28:38,283
What's that?

329
00:28:38,383 --> 00:28:40,085
She has to die, too.

330
00:28:40,185 --> 00:28:41,987
She's not like her brother.

331
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:44,823
I know you believe that.

332
00:28:44,923 --> 00:28:47,426
But she has a devil in her.

333
00:28:47,526 --> 00:28:49,737
But she can be saved.

334
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:09,648
What was that?

335
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:11,994
What is it?

336
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,687
It's probably just a raccoon.

337
00:29:15,787 --> 00:29:19,758
Or a halo if he's trying to distract us.

338
00:29:19,858 --> 00:29:23,162
They just cut his wings off.
He's not strong enough to send a halo.

339
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:25,439
(DISTORTED WHISPERING)

340
00:29:55,927 --> 00:29:57,729
Ssh, shh shh shh.

341
00:29:57,829 --> 00:29:59,972
I'm here, brother. I'm here.

342
00:30:13,945 --> 00:30:15,952
Friendly! Friendly! Hold your...

343
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:22,588
We're not done here.

344
00:30:22,688 --> 00:30:25,332
Not by a long shot. Let's go. Let's go!

345
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,733
What's going on?!

346
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:38,870
Everybody stay calm! Stay calm!

347
00:30:38,970 --> 00:30:41,181
Remember your training!
These are just halos!

348
00:30:44,176 --> 00:30:45,853
It's okay, brother. I'm here now.

349
00:30:58,390 --> 00:31:02,502
We've all dealt with him before!
Everybody just stay in control!

350
00:31:03,662 --> 00:31:05,202
Come here, come here.

351
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:10,536
Guns down, everybody! Everybody!

352
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:19,544
Now we're better than this.

353
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:24,082
What you're seeing is not real!
It's a halo, okay?

354
00:31:24,182 --> 00:31:26,084
You hear me? It's not real. It's a halo.

- She's in her room.
- Sure about that?

00:51:11,335 --> 00:51:13,504
(GUNSHOTS)

533
00:51:13,604 --> 00:51:16,043
Hold fire! Hold your fire!

534
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:19,848
He'll kill everyone, Damon.

535
00:51:23,213 --> 00:51:26,016
Everyone inside now! Move, move, move!

536
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:52,109
You see this, Knicks?
You see what I'm trying to stop?

537
00:51:52,209 --> 00:51:53,579
Okay.

538
00:51:58,248 --> 00:52:00,050
- I can kill him.
- You can kill him?

539
00:52:00,150 --> 00:52:01,385
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

540
00:52:01,485 --> 00:52:04,655
That healing should have taken days.
In here, it took seconds.

541
00:52:04,755 --> 00:52:06,790
He comes into this house,
his power grows, too.

542
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,125
How do you kill that?

543
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:10,060
- MAN: He's coming!
- (GUNFIRE)

544
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:11,734
Cover the windows, let's go!

545
00:52:15,766 --> 00:52:17,334
We got relics.

546
00:52:17,434 --> 00:52:18,906
Set them up.

547
00:52:20,104 --> 00:52:21,405
Go!

548
00:52:22,740 --> 00:52:25,816
Don't fire until you know it's real,
do you understand?

549
00:52:38,489 --> 00:52:40,090
Please let them go.

550
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:42,094
300 years, Damon.

551
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:45,732
300 years your prisoner.

552
00:52:47,131 --> 00:52:49,104
And we will be free.

553
00:52:55,973 --> 00:52:59,015
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti, amen.

554
00:53:02,546 --> 00:53:05,249
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti, amen.

555
00:53:05,349 --> 00:53:07,595
(DISTORTED WHISPERING)

556
00:53:10,054 --> 00:53:13,096
In nomine Patris, et Filii,
et Spiritus Sancti, amen.

557
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:33,181
Guys?

558
00:54:02,106 --> 00:54:03,578
You all right?

559
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:27,331
Contact! I see him, too!

560
00:54:27,431 --> 00:54:29,711
Michael is down! Go, go!

561
00:54:30,934 --> 00:54:33,037
Hey, she's telling him
everything we're doing.

562
00:54:33,137 --> 00:54:34,605
- ZIB: He's powerful here.
- Everything we do.

563
00:54:34,705 --> 00:54:35,873
He's stronger than I am.

564
00:54:35,973 --> 00:54:38,842
I'm doing everything that I can, but I don't
even know if he's gonna respond.

565
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:40,978
- We can't trust her, you know...
- I know that!

566
00:54:41,078 --> 00:54:42,516
I know that.

567
00:54:51,889 --> 00:54:53,259
There.

568
00:55:35,299 --> 00:55:37,171
All right, let's get back to work.

569
00:55:38,468 --> 00:55:39,903
Windows secure?

570
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:41,772
Most of them.

571
00:55:41,872 --> 00:55:43,412
The beast got the relics.

572
00:55:58,222 --> 00:56:01,458
Damon, if we can fortify this cabin,
we can trap him.

573
00:56:01,558 --> 00:56:03,193
DAMON: You saw what happened
when she came inside.

574
00:56:03,293 --> 00:56:05,129
We can't risk giving him that power.

575
00:56:05,229 --> 00:56:07,698
So we sit here until he attacks again.

576
00:56:07,798 --> 00:56:09,967
Valley is sending reinforcements.
I already told you that.

577
00:56:10,067 --> 00:56:12,402
ZIB: They won't get here in time.

578
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:14,972
And you assume that's gonna
get you what you want, huh?

579
00:56:15,072 --> 00:56:16,540
How?

580
00:56:16,640 --> 00:56:19,810
Then we'll be free of you
once and for all.

581
00:56:19,910 --> 00:56:23,680
No, you won't.
We'll keep hunting you, trust me.

582
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:28,152
All those years.

583
00:56:28,252 --> 00:56:31,822
All those years what, Damon?

584
00:56:31,922 --> 00:56:34,065
All those years in your cage?

585
00:56:35,592 --> 00:56:39,163
All those years bound and captive...

586
00:56:39,263 --> 00:56:42,567
tortured at the whim of my jailer?

587
00:56:44,034 --> 00:56:46,103
You were nice to me, fine.

588
00:56:46,203 --> 00:56:47,743
You know what that's worth?

589
00:56:49,373 --> 00:56:52,051
The kindness of a slaver is no kindness!

590
00:56:53,577 --> 00:56:55,679
You are not a slave.

591
00:56:55,779 --> 00:57:01,518
And you dictate where I live,
what I do, who I know.

592
00:57:01,618 --> 00:57:04,621
You've kept me from my family,

593
00:57:04,721 --> 00:57:06,924
and I serve
at the pleasure of the Keepers.

594
00:57:07,024 --> 00:57:12,100
You look at me, you look at me, Damon,
and you tell me, how am I not a slave?

596
00:57:15,098 --> 00:57:16,502
You're right.

597
00:57:17,434 --> 00:57:21,104
You honestly still feel empathy
for this thing, don't you?

598
00:57:21,204 --> 00:57:24,041
How do we move forward?
How do we go forward

599
00:57:31,648 --> 00:57:33,016
DAMON: Help me.

600
00:57:33,116 --> 00:57:37,521
Help me recapture your brother
and I will give you your freedom.

601
00:57:37,621 --> 00:57:40,123
I'll get true freedom
when my brother kills you all.

602
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:41,391
No, you won't.

603
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:44,027
Even if you kill us,

604
00:57:44,127 --> 00:57:46,396
the Keepers will never stop hunting you.

605
00:57:46,496 --> 00:57:47,831
Give me your brother.

606
00:57:47,931 --> 00:57:51,168
I will take that anklet off,
and you can walk away.

607
00:57:51,268 --> 00:57:52,736
Are you being serious?

608
00:57:52,836 --> 00:57:55,505
He comes into this cabin,
everything is lost.

609
00:57:55,605 --> 00:57:57,975
And I would do anything,
anything to prevent that.

610
00:57:58,075 --> 00:58:01,578
But you wouldn't
have to prevent it if...

611
00:58:01,678 --> 00:58:03,647
she hadn't let him go.

612
00:58:03,747 --> 00:58:06,425
I know, Knicks, but he's still out.

613
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:10,854
So now you're gonna put your...

614
00:58:10,954 --> 00:58:16,260
your trust into this thing
that let him go already.

615
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:18,162
I don't trust her, Knicks.

616
00:58:19,830 --> 00:58:21,973
We can't do this without her help.

617
00:58:27,004 --> 00:58:28,749
What do you need me to do?

618
00:58:31,508 --> 00:58:32,709
DAMON: We need to secure the cabin.

619
00:58:32,809 --> 00:58:35,779
Without the reliquary and more ammunition,
we won't make it through the night.

620
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:38,181
But your brother took all the supplies
that Knicks brought with him,

621
00:58:38,281 --> 00:58:39,516
so we need more.

622
00:58:39,616 --> 00:58:41,918
I just happen to know of a truck
laden down with them nearby.

623
00:58:46,523 --> 00:58:49,092
So you want me to help you
get back to the trailer?

624
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,028
Your brother is already wounded.

625
00:58:51,128 --> 00:58:54,264
We just need you to keep him away from us
long enough to get there and get back.

626
00:58:54,364 --> 00:58:56,566
- I'm coming with you.
- I wasn't planning on leaving you.

627
00:58:56,666 --> 00:58:59,903
I'd rather not be here at half strength
if he attacks us again.

628
00:59:00,003 --> 00:59:02,572
Well, the larger the group,
the harder it is for me to hide you.

629
00:59:02,672 --> 00:59:04,641
Knicks, you bring Tommy.
I'm gonna bring Maya.

630
00:59:04,741 --> 00:59:07,644
So we split our forces
into two groups on her word?

631
00:59:07,744 --> 00:59:10,380
Do it or he'll find us and kill you all.

632
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:15,319
She's outnumbered,
and he's on her home-field.

633
00:59:15,419 --> 00:59:18,922
Basic strategy 101...
divide and conquer.

634
00:59:19,022 --> 00:59:23,427
If she's lying, we're all dead either way.
So it doesn't matter, does it?

635
00:59:23,527 --> 00:59:27,130
I want her bound. Okay?

636
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:28,498
Me too.

637
00:59:28,598 --> 00:59:30,900
- Do I get a say in this?
- No, you don't.

638
00:59:33,403 --> 00:59:35,705
Make sure you should keep
that shock button close at hand.

639
00:59:38,642 --> 00:59:41,348
You didn't have to tell me that.
(LAUGHS)

640
01:00:02,899 --> 01:00:04,837
I am sorry, Damon.

641
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:09,006
I didn't wanna hurt you.

642
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:11,613
Just keep him off us, all right?

643
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:19,449
There's something
I need to know you understand.

644
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:23,653
We've held you for nearly 300 years,
and I get that you're angry.

646
01:00:23,753 --> 01:00:26,456
The idea of righteous vengeance
would be a pretty appealing one.

647
01:00:26,556 --> 01:00:28,558
That anger blinds you, Zib.

648
01:00:29,358 --> 01:00:33,697
There's no good in your brother.
No love, no kindness, only pain.

649
01:00:33,797 --> 01:00:36,232
Only what you put there.

650
01:00:36,332 --> 01:00:39,336
Maybe. When the time comes,
I and all of mine will face our sins,

651
01:00:39,436 --> 01:00:42,005
but right now, as I place my life
and the lives of mine in your hands,

652
01:00:42,105 --> 01:00:45,784
you need to understand...
your brother can't give you what you want.

653
01:00:47,244 --> 01:00:49,913
Well, I appreciate your concern.

654
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:52,215
I'm not concerned for you.

655
01:00:54,251 --> 01:00:57,654
I just want you to understand
you can't win...

656
01:00:57,754 --> 01:00:59,431
not like this.

657
01:01:44,201 --> 01:01:45,809
Go, go, go.

658
01:01:52,175 --> 01:01:53,954
Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.

659
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:58,318
Wait a minute. Wait, wait, wait, wait.

660
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:09,996
He's not here.

661
01:02:12,229 --> 01:02:13,497
Good. Let's keep moving.

662
01:02:13,597 --> 01:02:15,399
Let's go. Go.

663
01:02:53,903 --> 01:02:55,511
Still nothing.

664
01:02:59,042 --> 01:03:00,377
Let's go.

665
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:14,624
(ROARS)

666
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:16,693
Everyone in the trailer!
Everybody in the trailer now!

667
01:03:16,793 --> 01:03:18,228
Go! Go, go!

668
01:03:18,328 --> 01:03:19,868
Secure that door.

669
01:03:34,077 --> 01:03:36,046
What happened here?

670
01:03:36,146 --> 01:03:39,620
What happened here?
This is what we're fighting against.

671
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:43,086
He's making a profane space.

672
01:03:43,186 --> 01:03:44,988
He's sick. That's what he is.

673
01:03:45,088 --> 01:03:46,323
No.

674
01:03:46,423 --> 01:03:49,593
He's making a place
of comfort for himself.

675
01:03:49,693 --> 01:03:52,028
If we bless the room,
it weakens him, right?

676
01:03:52,128 --> 01:03:54,305
Right now he's doing the opposite.

677
01:03:55,699 --> 01:03:57,410
Zib.

678
01:03:59,035 --> 01:04:00,814
Zib!

679
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:09,679
You lied to me.

680
01:04:09,779 --> 01:04:15,290
I have to make physical contact
to connect with him if he's up in the air.

681
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:19,256
Why didn't you tell us that?

682
01:04:19,356 --> 01:04:20,523
Don't you think
you should tell us that, huh?

683
01:04:20,623 --> 01:04:21,891
I didn't know.

684
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:23,526
It never came up
while he was in your cage.

685
01:04:23,626 --> 01:04:26,563
Wasn't in my cage.
Hey, this is your friend.

686
01:04:26,663 --> 01:04:28,298
Let's just get the relics
and get out of here.

687
01:04:28,398 --> 01:04:30,867
I couldn't agree more.
Couldn't have said it any better either.

688
01:04:30,967 --> 01:04:32,473
Tommy, here.

689
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:39,876
DAMON: Knicks?

690
01:04:40,810 --> 01:04:42,145
Knicks!

691
01:04:42,245 --> 01:04:43,913
- Me?
- Yeah.

692
01:04:44,013 --> 01:04:45,383
Come here.

693
01:04:47,851 --> 01:04:49,219
What?

694
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:50,754
We have a chance here.

695
01:04:50,854 --> 01:04:52,722
- Really? What do you mean?
- Look around you.

696
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:55,659
He's made a home here. He's made a den.

697
01:04:55,759 --> 01:04:58,228
So he likes dens. He's a gentleman.

698
01:04:58,328 --> 01:05:00,930
Where we have a confined space,
plenty of munitions,

699
01:05:01,030 --> 01:05:03,537
and 300 gallons of diesel fuel
on the other side of that wall.

700
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:07,637
Damon, great.

701
01:05:07,737 --> 01:05:11,382
But I'm not gonna stay here... and die.

702
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:16,646
- ZIB: Are you gonna blow up the truck?
- No.

703
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:19,115
I'm gonna blow up the truck
with the beast inside of it.

704
01:05:19,215 --> 01:05:21,284
- Tommy, you have the C4?
- Yes.

705
01:05:21,384 --> 01:05:24,854
Place it near the fuel tanks.
Make sure that explosion will reach them.

706
01:05:24,954 --> 01:05:28,591
No, you said you were
just gonna recapture him.

707
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:31,861
He'll make it through the other side.
You and I both know that.

708
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:35,699
With any luck, we'll weaken him enough
that we can survive the night.

709
01:05:35,799 --> 01:05:37,701
It'll be agony for him.

710
01:05:37,801 --> 01:05:39,202
I know.

711
01:05:39,302 --> 01:05:41,377
I'm sorry, Z, there's no other way.

712
01:05:48,611 --> 01:05:50,686
Yes.

713
01:05:52,315 --> 01:05:53,616
What is that?

714
01:05:56,252 --> 01:05:58,555
It's what you kill a beast with.

715
01:05:58,655 --> 01:06:00,724
I thought this was resolved, Knicks.

716
01:06:00,824 --> 01:06:02,826
It's changed.

717
01:06:02,926 --> 01:06:04,794
It's forged with a cross.

718
01:06:04,894 --> 01:06:07,197
It's been quenched in the waters
of the River Jordan.

719
01:06:07,297 --> 01:06:08,631
This...

720
01:06:08,731 --> 01:06:10,333
is a sacred blade.

721
01:06:10,433 --> 01:06:11,901
It's a piece of costume jewelry.

722
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:14,504
It doesn't matter what it is!

723
01:06:14,604 --> 01:06:16,973
We're not gonna kill him.

724
01:06:17,073 --> 01:06:18,241
You don't think it'll work?

725
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:21,211
- I don't care if it'll work, Knicks.
- I know it won't work.

726
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:24,014
- And you'd tell us if it would, of course.
- Try and kill him with it.

727
01:06:24,114 --> 01:06:25,915
In order to do that,
we have to bring him inside the cabin,

728
01:06:26,015 --> 01:06:27,484
which we are not doing.

729
01:06:27,584 --> 01:06:30,820
Hey, okay, Damon...

730
01:06:30,920 --> 01:06:33,423
hey, we're people, okay?

731
01:06:33,523 --> 01:06:35,992
It's you and me, right?

732
01:06:36,092 --> 01:06:37,594
Okay?

733
01:06:37,694 --> 01:06:40,530
So let's just, you know, let's...
let's just test it, okay?

734
01:06:40,630 --> 01:06:43,533
Let's just test it just to see
maybe... maybe I'm right.

735
01:06:43,633 --> 01:06:45,502
I mean, she's right here.

736
01:06:45,602 --> 01:06:48,238
We have the blood
of the beast amongst us.

737
01:06:48,338 --> 01:06:52,108
Just let me kill her to test it.

738
01:06:54,143 --> 01:06:56,079
I'm not testing anything, Knicks.

739
01:06:56,179 --> 01:06:57,514
We have the relics.

740
01:06:57,614 --> 01:07:00,116
Our only job is to secure the cabin
until reinforcements arrive

741
01:07:00,216 --> 01:07:02,519
and we can safely recapture that beast.

742
01:07:02,619 --> 01:07:06,956
Damon, she's the enemy.
Yet you continue to protect her.

743
01:07:07,056 --> 01:07:08,258
- No.
- Yes, you do.

744
01:07:08,358 --> 01:07:09,592
- No!
- Yes, you do.

745
01:07:09,692 --> 01:07:11,428
- I am not protecting her!
- You do protect her!

746
01:07:11,528 --> 01:07:14,631
Over your own men, you do! Why?!

747
01:07:14,731 --> 01:07:18,101
This stunt of yours...
this stunt of yours has gone long enough!

748
01:07:18,201 --> 01:07:20,136
I will not indulge it any further.

749
01:07:20,236 --> 01:07:22,939
Aren't you the guy, right,
that lost 20 of his men in two days?

750
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:24,443
Aren't you that guy?

751
01:07:25,408 --> 01:07:27,346
Those men were my friends!

752
01:07:39,756 --> 01:07:41,967
- What do we do?
- Just got to let them work it out.

753
01:07:48,598 --> 01:07:49,999
That's enough, Knicks!

754
01:07:50,099 --> 01:07:51,571
Stay down! That's enough!

755
01:07:58,041 --> 01:07:59,509
Damon!

756
01:07:59,609 --> 01:08:01,010
Stay outside.

757
01:08:01,110 --> 01:08:04,080
You have to let him back in, Knicks.

758
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:06,084
I don't have to do anything.

759
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:09,786
You proved your point, Knicks.
Let me back in.

760
01:08:09,886 --> 01:08:13,523
That's it, Damon.
Can't trust you anymore.

761
01:08:13,623 --> 01:08:15,266
- (WINGS FLAPPING)
- Sorry.

762
01:08:16,926 --> 01:08:19,829
You can stay inside and be quiet,

763
01:08:19,929 --> 01:08:22,799
or you can go outside and be with him.

764
01:08:22,899 --> 01:08:25,008

(SNARLING AND THUDDING)

768
01:08:45,421 --> 01:08:46,656
Stop!

769
01:08:46,756 --> 01:08:48,399
Good luck, Knicks.

770
01:08:50,426 --> 01:08:52,328
I pray that you're right.

771
01:08:52,428 --> 01:08:55,368
- No!
- (ROARING)

772
01:09:02,305 --> 01:09:03,709
Let's move out.

773
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:10,917
(BEEP)

774
01:09:30,266 --> 01:09:31,401
What now?

775
01:09:31,501 --> 01:09:33,503
We wait.

776
01:09:33,603 --> 01:09:35,007
For how long?

777
01:09:37,774 --> 01:09:39,178
Not long.

778
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:57,136
I can't see those hands again,
I'm gonna kill you, okay?

779
01:10:04,467 --> 01:10:05,871
Wait.

780
01:10:07,503 --> 01:10:08,941
Now.

781
01:10:13,076 --> 01:10:15,878
Yes! Yes!

782
01:10:15,978 --> 01:10:20,450
Not so tough now, you stupid goat head!

783
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:23,286
Relax, we still gotta find him
and put him back in the box, all right?

784
01:10:23,386 --> 01:10:25,154
(LAUGHS)

785
01:10:25,254 --> 01:10:27,123
She's upset about her brother.
She's hysterical.

786
01:10:27,223 --> 01:10:28,524
Hey.

787
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:34,163
You just don't get it, do you? (LAUGHS)

788
01:10:34,263 --> 01:10:37,667
After all this time with him
and you still don't realize.

789
01:10:37,767 --> 01:10:42,639
You watched him go into the trailer.
You watched it blow up,

790
01:10:42,739 --> 01:10:44,407
But you forget one thing.

791
01:10:44,507 --> 01:10:46,809
He...

792
01:10:46,909 --> 01:10:49,078
makes... you...

793
01:10:49,178 --> 01:10:51,389
see things.

Close the door.

What happened out there?

802
01:11:49,138 --> 01:11:50,373
Well, we got the relics.

803
01:11:50,473 --> 01:11:52,408
And a knife to kill the beast.

804
01:11:52,508 --> 01:11:53,676
Damon and Maya?

805
01:11:53,776 --> 01:11:56,179
Dead. It got ugly.

806
01:11:56,279 --> 01:11:58,881
Without their sacrifice...

807
01:11:58,981 --> 01:12:02,051
we wouldn't be alive.

808
01:12:02,151 --> 01:12:05,154
I can kill the beast. I can prove it.

Tommy, go get the bedroom ready, okay?

810
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:20,478
This blade can harm him
and put to an end...

(BONES CRACK, KNICKS SCREAMS)

812

Get her.

813

Tommy, tie her up,
but not so tightly that she can't move.

814
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:34,811
Danny, come here. Push my arm back in.

815
01:13:34,911 --> 01:13:37,013
Help me with my arm. Here, hard.

816
01:13:37,113 --> 01:13:38,414
Harder!

817
01:13:40,750 --> 01:13:42,927
Three people can't hold this cabin.

818
01:13:45,221 --> 01:13:46,693
We'll stick to the plan.

819
01:13:51,961 --> 01:13:54,332
Secure the room. Secure the room.

820
01:14:00,703 --> 01:14:02,104
I don't understand it.

821
01:14:02,204 --> 01:14:03,773
Understand what?

822
01:14:03,873 --> 01:14:08,010
He could have killed us at any time
in the Pine Barrens, and he didn't.

823
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:09,855
He let you go.

824
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:15,218
Don't listen to her. Just ignore her.

825
01:14:15,318 --> 01:14:17,553
She's just trying
to psyche you out, okay?

826
01:14:17,653 --> 01:14:19,522
He let you go, Tommy,

827
01:14:19,622 --> 01:14:24,769
because he wants you here
in his home when he kills you.

828
01:14:27,163 --> 01:14:30,333
We're here, brother.

You poor, poor man.

846
01:16:28,918 --> 01:16:30,720
You think you've won.

No, no, no, no, no.

848
01:16:39,628 --> 01:16:41,864
You know what you have done?

849
01:16:41,964 --> 01:16:43,538
Nothing.

and one shall rise triumphant.

So very, very wrong.

the struggle...

878
01:18:47,089 --> 01:18:50,461
it isn't between...
humanity and the beast.

01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:55,975
It is... between the children.

01:19:01,203 --> 01:19:03,439
Don't worry.

881
01:19:03,539 --> 01:19:05,341
You'll be free.

Between the man and the beast...

883
01:19:23,559 --> 01:19:25,395
it has to be you, Zib.

884
01:19:28,964 --> 01:19:30,504
You're the only one.

885
01:19:43,545 --> 01:19:45,415
(GRUNTING)

886
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:20,960
They're all dead.

887
01:20:22,151 --> 01:20:23,725
And we're home.

888
01:20:25,688 --> 01:20:29,091
Tomorrow, when more come...

889
01:20:29,191 --> 01:20:31,760
We'll kill them too.

890
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:35,097
And they will never enslave us...

891
01:20:35,197 --> 01:20:38,239
or separate us ever again.

892
01:20:39,635 --> 01:20:41,704
(ROARS)

893
01:20:41,804 --> 01:20:44,345
(ROARS)

894
01:21:11,834 --> 01:21:13,340
What are you doing?

895
01:21:14,737 --> 01:21:16,107
It's me.

896
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:33,222
Stop.

897
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:40,234
I'm your sister.

898
01:21:48,337 --> 01:21:51,413
We're free now.
We don't have to fight anymore.

899
01:22:12,728 --> 01:22:14,166
All those years...

900
01:22:17,032 --> 01:22:19,869
everything we've suffered?

901
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:27,380
I'm your sister!

902
01:22:32,648 --> 01:22:34,222
Your friend.

903
01:22:38,954 --> 01:22:40,562
I love you.

904
01:22:52,468 --> 01:22:54,611
Why are you doing this?

905
01:23:06,315 --> 01:23:08,117
I love you, brother.

906
01:23:12,921 --> 01:23:14,427
And I'm sorry.

907
01:23:22,764 --> 01:23:24,600
(GRUNTS)

908
01:23:40,516 --> 01:23:42,489
Be at peace, brother.

909
01:23:48,957 --> 01:23:51,727
MAN: (ON TWO-WAY RADIO)
Come in, Damon. Damon, come in.

910
01:23:51,827 --> 01:23:54,329
This is Dyer responding to your call.

911
01:23:54,829 --> 01:23:57,635
Any surviving team members,
please respond.

912
01:24:18,220 --> 01:24:19,922
MAN: In the New World,

913
01:24:20,022 --> 01:24:23,459
the 13th child
of a 13th child will be born,

914
01:24:23,559 --> 01:24:26,395
man and beast.

915
01:24:26,495 --> 01:24:30,800
Where root first strikes earth
shall host their final struggle.

916
01:24:32,501 --> 01:24:36,180
ZIB: One shall rise triumphant.
