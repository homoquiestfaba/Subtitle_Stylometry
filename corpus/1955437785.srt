00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:23,081
I thought it was gonna be
different this year.

350
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:27,489
One of Hitler's central themes in his writing
is that it was a Nazi's responsibility

351
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,646
to aid evolution by exterminating
less evolved people groups.

352
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,003
In his opinion, that was those
who had different-colored skin,

353
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:37,202
were religious or were handicapped.

354
00:20:37,320 --> 00:20:41,044
Hitler thought natural selection
should be actively aided.

355
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,843
Come on, dude.

356
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:49,167
You're never gonna change
what's happening in there.

357
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:52,250
That's just the way the world is.

358

Well, I want to change the world.

Don't know yet.

00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:02,483
Do you ever feel like
you can't see your future?

362
00:21:02,600 --> 00:21:04,568
You know, feel like...

363
00:21:04,680 --> 00:21:06,967
like it might be your last year?

364
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,286
No.

365
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:10,402
(LAUGHS): Super morbid.

366
00:21:12,200 --> 00:21:14,123
It's not, though.

367
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:17,202
It's more like...

368
00:21:17,320 --> 00:21:18,810
something big's gonna happen.

369
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,607
Like a chain reaction.

370
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,480
Not sure what that means,
but I'm here for you.

371
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,608
I never made it to class.

00:21:42,160 --> 00:21:44,083
Am I gonna lose you
as my prom date already?

378
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:45,924
I thought that was only
if we couldn't find anyone.

379
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:47,565
Yeah, well, neither of us have
in three years.

380
00:21:47,680 --> 00:21:50,445
You'll find someone.

He gets me.

It's like he was made for me.

392
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:16,291
Miss Scott, is there something
that you'd like to share

393

- No, not really.

(CHUCKLES)

397
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:30,964
Uh, theater is one of the six classic
art forms, so I'd argue that...

398
00:22:31,120 --> 00:22:33,009
this is art class.

00:37:58,080 --> 00:38:01,209
She's staying in this house
that's full of junkies,

700
00:38:01,320 --> 00:38:05,171
so I've been living in an alley
near here the past couple weeks.

701
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:06,486
And, uh...

702
00:38:06,600 --> 00:38:09,331
it's just really hard to get a job,

703
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,489
you know, without an address.

704
00:38:24,040 --> 00:38:25,963
Are you okay?

705
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:30,531
(EXHALES)

706
00:38:41,400 --> 00:38:43,129
Where are you going?

707
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:45,083
What was I supposed to say?

708
00:38:46,560 --> 00:38:49,166
- That's exactly what you should have said.
- No.

709
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:51,965
I'm not like them. And I'm...
definitely not like you.

710
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:54,082
How do you know?

711
00:38:54,200 --> 00:38:56,931
You haven't even bothered
to get to know any of them.

712
00:38:58,000 --> 00:38:59,365
Listen...

713
00:38:59,520 --> 00:39:01,488
I get it.

714
00:39:03,120 --> 00:39:05,043
- You've had it rough.
- Hey, Nate.

715
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:07,845
(WRY CHUCKLE) It's Nathan.

716
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,007
Nathan. (CLEARS THROAT SOFTLY)

717
00:39:09,120 --> 00:39:11,168
Sorry. Um...

718
00:39:11,280 --> 00:39:12,964
it's not much, but...

719
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:17,525
if you want, um, you could stay
at my place until you figure things out.

720
00:39:17,640 --> 00:39:19,085
We got a couch in the basement.

721
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,488
If that doesn't work, um, I think...
some of the other guys

722
00:39:22,600 --> 00:39:25,001
are checking with their parents, too.

723
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:35,281
Thanks, man.

724
00:39:35,400 --> 00:39:37,528
That's...

725
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:42,208
You can call me Nate.

726
00:39:42,320 --> 00:39:44,163
It's cool.

727
00:39:46,240 --> 00:39:47,651
Tony.

728
00:39:57,680 --> 00:39:59,603
(PHONE RINGS)

729
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:03,523
- Eric?
- ERIC: Why are you still at home?

730
00:40:03,640 --> 00:40:06,371
You're three minutes late.

731
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:08,960
Oh, man. I slept in.

732
00:40:09,080 --> 00:40:11,651
You slept in again? What,
you don't own an alarm clock?

733
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:14,371
I'm running late. So what?
Ride the bus, Eric.

734
00:40:14,480 --> 00:40:16,289
I'm not gonna ride the bus
with those idiots!

735
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:18,243
Look, man, I'm not
your personal taxi service.

736
00:40:18,360 --> 00:40:20,966
If you're not here
in five minutes, you're dead.

737
00:40:21,080 --> 00:40:23,003
- I know where you sleep.

739
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,966
- Hey, yo, R.J.!
- Hey.

740
00:40:31,080 --> 00:40:32,445
- Got a date to prom yet?
- No.

741
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:33,607
He never asked me.

742
00:40:33,720 --> 00:40:35,245
What?

743
00:40:35,360 --> 00:40:36,850
- Want to bet on that?
- Shut up.

744
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:38,200
- (BOTH CHUCKLE)
- Mm!

745
00:40:38,320 --> 00:40:40,084
Sorry, R.J., this is Dave.

746
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:41,531
Just moved here from the Springs.

747
00:40:41,640 --> 00:40:42,721
- Hey.
- Hey.

748
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,205
You like it here so far?

749
00:40:44,320 --> 00:40:46,004
It's all right.

750
00:40:46,120 --> 00:40:48,009
I don't really know many people yet.

751
00:40:48,120 --> 00:40:49,690
Why'd you move?

752
00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:51,524
Parents separated.

753
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:55,730
I've been through that.

754
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:59,811
Mom took us up here
and we moved in with my aunt.

755
00:40:59,920 --> 00:41:02,241
Well, they're not divorced yet.

756
00:41:02,360 --> 00:41:04,089
Maybe there's some hope.

757
00:41:05,200 --> 00:41:06,611
Maybe.

758
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:11,769
Hey, I got to run,
but if you ever want to talk,

759
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:12,961
let me know.

760
00:41:13,080 --> 00:41:14,844
All right.

761
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:16,166
Thanks.

762
00:41:17,480 --> 00:41:18,970
I'm going to meet with my mentor.

763
00:41:19,120 --> 00:41:21,122
- Ooh, zee mentor.
- The mentor.

764
00:41:21,240 --> 00:41:22,162
Ow! Ow!

765
00:41:22,280 --> 00:41:24,328
Get that part!

766
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:29,365
I just lost my date to prom.

(BOTH LAUGH)

768
00:41:38,520 --> 00:41:40,727
I've never been in here all alone.

(QUIET LAUGH)

770
00:41:42,200 --> 00:41:43,725
Well, I figure if we practice in here,

771
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,524
then when you audition,
it won't be such a big deal.

772
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,688
You'll be comfortable with the space.

773
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:49,609
Good idea.

774
00:41:49,720 --> 00:41:52,200
Even though all the world's my stage.

775
00:41:52,360 --> 00:41:53,885
And Alex and Rachel merely players.

776
00:41:54,960 --> 00:41:57,767
They have their exits and their entrances.

777
00:41:57,880 --> 00:42:00,360
Oh, bravo.

778
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,927
You know, that's a poem read
by a depressed guy about death.

779
00:42:04,080 --> 00:42:05,445
Or life.

780
00:42:05,560 --> 00:42:07,767
Depending on how you look at it.

781
00:42:10,080 --> 00:42:12,890
Step on up here, my muse. This...

782
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,765
is where it all begins.

783
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:19,801
You are so full of it, Jason!

784
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:22,651
I'm done. I'm never talking to you again!

785
00:42:22,760 --> 00:42:24,728
I know you can do better.

786
00:42:24,840 --> 00:42:27,650
I just don't really believe you yet.

787
00:42:27,760 --> 00:42:30,809
It's okay. Just close your eyes, okay?

788
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:33,400
And imagine how she feels.

789
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,602
Okay, the passion.

790
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,802
The anger.

791
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:40,321
The attraction.

792
00:42:40,440 --> 00:42:42,761
- I'm going to play practice.
- Again?

793
00:42:42,880 --> 00:42:44,086
Honey, that's every night this week.

794
00:42:44,200 --> 00:42:46,646
Mom, you know how important this is to me.

795
00:42:46,760 --> 00:42:48,091
Yes, I know, but don't be late.

796
00:42:48,200 --> 00:42:49,281
You have homework to get done.

797
00:42:49,400 --> 00:42:50,686
And I expect you to stay up as late

798
00:42:50,800 --> 00:42:52,643
- as you need to to get it done!
- Okay!

they weren't really there for me.

My dad just up and left when I was a kid.

802
00:43:03,320 --> 00:43:06,403

00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,531
I haven't talked to him in years.

805
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:13,609
It leaves a hole inside, doesn't it?

806
00:43:16,040 --> 00:43:17,485
Yeah.

- Oh, wow.

Madison didn't tell me
you were that good at ballet.

- I have many secret talents.
- Mm.

to fail this geometry test.

So good.

and we totally connect in so many ways.

Yeah, we're like...

I think we were meant to find each other.

But it's okay, you know,
'cause pain, it...

848
00:44:47,080 --> 00:44:50,368
it gives us an energy that
we can channel for our art.

the darkness to bring the light.

I'm fine.

1052
00:54:41,600 --> 00:54:44,046
I don't like you going to these parties.

1053
00:54:44,160 --> 00:54:46,527
That's where people are
that need light the most.

1054
00:54:46,640 --> 00:54:48,449
I'm trying to make an impact.

1055
00:54:49,640 --> 00:54:53,129
I think they're impacting you
more than you're impacting them.

1056

your mom says you can have them back.

1062

I wouldn't miss it.

- (LAUGHS) No.

1075

I don't know where I'd be.

1076
00:56:04,440 --> 00:56:07,205
You accepted me for who I am, and...

1077
00:56:07,320 --> 00:56:09,448
I want you... I want you to have them.

1078
00:56:10,800 --> 00:56:13,201

It's not really your style.

1083
00:56:23,400 --> 00:56:24,811

1084
00:56:24,920 --> 00:56:26,763
Yeah, why don't you bring him around?

1085
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:31,690
I just don't know where I stand
with him right now exactly.

1086

What does he say?

1087
00:56:34,200 --> 00:56:37,165
Just that we're gonna finish the play,
and then we'll figure things out.

1088
00:56:38,600 --> 00:56:41,285

while he figures things out?

He's really spiritual.

a Christian boyfriend.

1096

He really respects my faith.

1097
00:56:57,760 --> 00:56:59,649
He just believes in a lot
of things right now.

mess around with that guy.

Celine, I wouldn't tell anybody.

1398

You know, my mom would
totally let you stay with us.

01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:38,562
We should probably stop ignoring her.

1403

It's gonna be like Oklahoma City,
the L.A. riots and World War II

RACHEL (VOICE-OVER):
I've always been drawn to hands.

1411
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:14,526
I think it's because it's
the way that we touch people.

1412
01:17:14,640 --> 01:17:18,210
Compassion is the greatest form
of love that humans have to offer.

1413
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:20,840
I have this theory that if one person

1414
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:23,884
can go out of their way
to show compassion,

1415
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,162
it could start a chain reaction.

How do you know that trust and beauty

1417
01:17:29,800 --> 01:17:33,202
and compassion won't make the
world a better place to be in?

1418

Tomorrow's not a promise...

1419
01:17:36,480 --> 01:17:37,845
but it's a chance.

1420
01:17:37,960 --> 01:17:40,486
You just might start a chain reaction.

1421
01:17:53,640 --> 01:17:56,962

I just wanted to be real with you guys
and let you know who I am.

eyewitnesses say that
two gunmen came in shooting

dismissed it as a prank,
