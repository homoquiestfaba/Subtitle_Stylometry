1
00:02:22,809 --> 00:02:25,478
Boarding for Los Angeles.

2
00:06:55,148 --> 00:06:56,148
Hey.

3
00:07:04,690 --> 00:07:05,690
You Kurt?

4
00:07:08,194 --> 00:07:09,362
Who are you?

5
00:07:11,264 --> 00:07:12,264
I'm Adam.

6
00:07:17,303 --> 00:07:18,759
You're Adam?

7
00:07:19,005 --> 00:07:20,173
Yeah.

8
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,147
I didn't expect
someone so young.

9
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:32,585
Is that gonna be a problem?

10
00:07:39,392 --> 00:07:41,081
Ron knows what he's doing.

11
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:43,884
He sent me here to meet you.

12
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,965
You must be all right.

13
00:07:47,667 --> 00:07:48,667
Okay.

14
00:07:51,370 --> 00:07:53,427
You want to get going?

15
00:07:53,673 --> 00:07:54,673
Yeah.

16
00:08:57,069 --> 00:08:58,237
You all right?

17
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:01,707
Kurt, this is Michael.

18
00:09:02,541 --> 00:09:04,377
This was all his idea.

19
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,404
So, how'd you two
get Ron's number?

20
00:09:10,650 --> 00:09:13,486
He doesn't usually
deal with kids.

21
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,910
We spent a lot of
time going to a lot

22
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:20,226
of really shitty
bars and nightclubs,

23
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:22,683
and looked around for
anyone that looked

24
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:25,285
like they might do
this kind of thing,

25
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,700
or knew someone who would.

26
00:09:30,603 --> 00:09:33,773
So, you found
someone that knew Ron?

27
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:35,996
Yeah.

28
00:09:36,242 --> 00:09:39,933
We called him up and he
told us all about you.

29
00:09:40,179 --> 00:09:42,636
He said you were in the Army.

30
00:09:42,882 --> 00:09:44,717
Yeah, long time ago.

31
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:55,982
Is this the kind
of thing you do?

32
00:09:56,228 --> 00:09:59,065
This thing we're
paying you to do?

33
00:10:00,333 --> 00:10:00,922
No.

34
00:10:01,168 --> 00:10:03,069
I can't say that it is.

35
00:10:05,404 --> 00:10:09,575
When was the last time
you did something like this?

36
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:14,413
About 10 years
ago I killed a guy,

37
00:10:15,681 --> 00:10:18,284
but I didn't get paid to do it.

38
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:23,543
We were told that you would
take care of this for us,

39
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:24,745
that you wouldn't let us down.

40
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,393
I'm not gonna let you down.

41
00:10:28,260 --> 00:10:30,596
For the money you're paying?

42
00:10:32,498 --> 00:10:34,767
Just being honest with you.

43
00:10:36,802 --> 00:10:40,527
It's not just the one guy
you've killed though, right?

44
00:10:40,773 --> 00:10:42,062
What are you talking about?

45
00:10:42,308 --> 00:10:43,897
Ron, he told us about
when you were in the Army,

46
00:10:44,143 --> 00:10:46,679
and what they used to call you.

47
00:10:47,847 --> 00:10:49,936
Ron told you that?

48
00:10:50,182 --> 00:10:51,182
Yeah.

49
00:10:52,218 --> 00:10:53,218
Is it true?

50
00:10:55,755 --> 00:10:56,889
Yeah, it is,

51
00:11:51,777 --> 00:11:53,433
All right,
asshole, we got him now.

52
00:11:53,679 --> 00:11:55,168
He's gonna be here
in the room with us.

53
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:56,970
I'm gonna go over
the plan with him.

54
00:11:57,216 --> 00:11:58,216
He doesn't know.

55
00:12:06,058 --> 00:12:09,228
You guys watch a
lot of TV, or what?

56
00:12:10,262 --> 00:12:13,220
Kurt, get you a beer?

57
00:12:13,466 --> 00:12:15,534
Yeah, I'll take a beer.

58
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:25,811
Sit down, if you want.

59
00:12:56,275 --> 00:12:58,077
What is all this shit?

60
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:05,505
You know anything
about hacking?

61
00:13:05,751 --> 00:13:07,440
That's computer shit, right?

62
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,421
Yes, computer shit.

63
00:13:10,756 --> 00:13:14,514
We hack website for people's
financial information.

64
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:17,429
With that, we buy all this stuff

65
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:21,054
and sell it.

66
00:13:21,300 --> 00:13:22,301
Pure profit.

67
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:25,659
Looks like you're
doing all right to me.

68
00:13:25,905 --> 00:13:26,905
We were,

69
00:13:28,607 --> 00:13:31,498
until we started
working with this guy.

70
00:13:31,744 --> 00:13:33,967
Poor fuckin' choice.

71
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,447
What'd he do?

72
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,772
His name is Marty.

73
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,041
We met him a few months ago.

74
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,287
He's good,

75
00:13:43,422 --> 00:13:44,857
better than most.

76
00:13:45,991 --> 00:13:46,980
Things were going great.

77
00:13:47,226 --> 00:13:48,548
With the three of
us working together,

78
00:13:48,794 --> 00:13:51,197
we made a shit load of money.

79
00:13:52,932 --> 00:13:56,856
We had no idea he was gonna
fuck us over like he did.

80
00:13:57,102 --> 00:13:59,526
We left our guard down, and he,

81
00:13:59,772 --> 00:14:01,240
he took everything.

82
00:14:06,245 --> 00:14:08,134
And now everybody
knows about it.

83
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:11,004
He's been running his
fucking mouth all over town.

84
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:15,254
Little cocksucker deserves
what's coming to him.

85
00:14:22,027 --> 00:14:24,463
All right, what's the plan?

86
00:14:25,931 --> 00:14:27,887
He'll be at a bar
tonight, downtown.

87
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:29,956
Now, he's not gonna leave
until after one o'clock,

88
00:14:30,202 --> 00:14:31,391
so you got plenty of
time to get down there

89
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,259
and wait for him.

90
00:14:33,505 --> 00:14:36,329
To get downtown, you can
take a bus across the street.

91
00:14:36,575 --> 00:14:39,265
It'll take you downtown,
but not far enough.

92
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:40,800
You'll have to walk
the rest of the way,

93
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:44,270
but it shouldn't take you
more than half an hour.

94
00:14:44,516 --> 00:14:48,687
I've made directions for you,
for once you're off the bus.

95
00:14:59,064 --> 00:15:03,690
Why don't you take me down
there, drop me off, pick me up?

96
00:15:03,936 --> 00:15:05,258
Adam and I, we don't,

97
00:15:05,504 --> 00:15:08,061
we don't think it's a good
idea for us to be in the area

98
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:09,462
when it happens.

99
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,746
You know, we could be
implicated if anybody saw us.

100
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:17,771
How am I supposed to get back?

101
00:15:18,017 --> 00:15:19,439
You just backtrack
and take the bus

102
00:15:19,685 --> 00:15:21,808
going back in the
opposite direction.

103
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,054
Simple.

104
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,912
Now, the most important thing

105
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:28,548
is that you bring
us his license.

106
00:15:28,794 --> 00:15:30,016
That's how we can be
sure that you've done it.

107
00:15:30,262 --> 00:15:34,433
You bring us his license, and
we'll give you your money.

108
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:42,695
This is a pain in the ass.

109
00:15:42,941 --> 00:15:43,963
Why don't you take
me down there,

110
00:15:44,209 --> 00:15:46,199
drop me off, and pick me up?

111
00:15:46,445 --> 00:15:47,667
I already told you.

112
00:15:47,913 --> 00:15:48,902
A lot of the people down there,

113
00:15:49,148 --> 00:15:50,937
especially the ones
that go into that bar,

114
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:53,306
have seen us with
Marty in the past.

115
00:15:53,552 --> 00:15:54,774
I mean, if any of them saw us,

116
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:57,877
while he was being murdered...

117
00:15:58,123 --> 00:15:59,045
Do you understand?

118
00:15:59,291 --> 00:16:00,492
I understand,

119
00:16:01,794 --> 00:16:03,817
but if you're parked a
couple of blocks away,

120
00:16:04,063 --> 00:16:05,318
no one's gonna see you.

121
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,900
Michael told you the plan,

122
00:16:10,002 --> 00:16:12,838
and that's how
you're gonna do it.

123
00:16:22,681 --> 00:16:23,681
Fine.

124
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,540
You're the boss.

125
00:16:27,786 --> 00:16:28,786
Right?

126
00:16:33,926 --> 00:16:36,716
Kurt that bus is gonna be
going by in a few minutes.

127
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:38,718
You might wanna get going.

128
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:40,966
I'm gonna finish this.

129
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:06,112
My number is on that.

130
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,983
Give it a call when you're
on your way back, okay?

131
00:17:10,229 --> 00:17:11,230
Hey, Kurt?

132
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:16,756
We just want to know...

133
00:17:17,002 --> 00:17:19,004
How are you gonna do it?

134
00:17:23,575 --> 00:17:24,575
Why?

135
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:28,680
We just wanna know.

136
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:38,322
Good.

137
00:17:40,759 --> 00:17:41,981
You better have my money ready

138
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:44,563
by the time I get back here.

139
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:47,332
It will be.

140
00:17:57,676 --> 00:17:59,945
Watch your step.

141
00:18:26,672 --> 00:18:27,560
Stop requested.

142
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,195
Please use rear exit.

143
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:31,097
For your safety,
please watch your step

144
00:18:31,343 --> 00:18:33,078
when exiting the bus.

145
00:18:34,346 --> 00:18:36,569
Approaching Hoover and Plano,

146
00:18:36,815 --> 00:18:39,318
followed by Temple and Hoover.

147
00:19:01,607 --> 00:19:04,676
On Temple, 43, Temple
and Manchester.

148
00:19:43,248 --> 00:19:44,437
Kurt, what's up?

149
00:19:44,683 --> 00:19:45,705
What's up?

150
00:19:45,951 --> 00:19:47,674
These fucking kids you
got me dealing with,

151
00:19:47,920 --> 00:19:49,042
they don't know
what they're doing.

152
00:19:49,288 --> 00:19:49,977
Calm down, man.

153
00:19:50,223 --> 00:19:51,377
I only spoke with the one, Adam,

154
00:19:51,623 --> 00:19:52,845
and he seemed all right to me.

155
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:55,081
They ain't never done
something like this before.

156
00:19:55,327 --> 00:19:57,083
What do you mean, they don't
know what they're doing?

157
00:19:57,329 --> 00:19:59,152
Got me running all over LA.

158
00:19:59,398 --> 00:20:00,553
Wrote out directions.

159
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:03,356
Had me take the bus down here.

160
00:20:03,602 --> 00:20:04,590
Won't pick me up.

161
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:06,826
Gotta take the bus back.

162
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:09,962
I think for all this, I should
be getting more than half.

163
00:20:10,208 --> 00:20:11,864
They got you
doing all that shit?

164
00:20:12,110 --> 00:20:16,035
Goddamn, Kurt, I didn't know
it was gonna go this way.

165
00:20:16,281 --> 00:20:17,103
I'll make it up to you.

166
00:20:17,349 --> 00:20:19,038
I can't give you more than half,

167
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:22,241
but I might have a real
sweet deal in the making.

168
00:20:22,487 --> 00:20:23,910
What is it?

169
00:20:24,156 --> 00:20:26,279
Don't wanna tell you
about it now, it's too early.

170
00:20:26,525 --> 00:20:27,880
But if it works out,
you're gonna be working

171
00:20:28,126 --> 00:20:31,363
for a long time,
making the good money.

172
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:37,056
Not doing more work like this,
snuffing people out, is it?

173
00:20:37,302 --> 00:20:38,458
I really can't say anything

174
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:40,393
until I get more
information from the guy,

175
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:42,862
but I told him we've
had a lot of experience.

176
00:20:43,108 --> 00:20:45,231
We can handle whatever he's got.

177
00:20:45,477 --> 00:20:46,265
So this one you're doing now,

178
00:20:46,511 --> 00:20:48,568
for these chicken shit kids,

179
00:20:48,814 --> 00:20:51,738
consider it a warm-up,
'cause it's been a while.

180
00:20:51,984 --> 00:20:54,019
You know what I'm saying?

181
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:56,688
Know what I'm saying?

182
00:20:58,123 --> 00:21:00,246
I still think I should
get more than half for this.

183
00:21:00,492 --> 00:21:01,181
Can't do it, man.

184
00:21:01,427 --> 00:21:03,149
That's not the deal.

185
00:21:03,395 --> 00:21:04,584
But in a couple months,
you're not even gonna worry

186
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,085
about five grand.

187
00:21:06,331 --> 00:21:07,887
That's the kind of money
we're talking here.

188
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:10,089
Now, I've got to get going
in case he calls back.

189
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:11,557
I'll talk to you later, Kurt.

190
00:21:11,803 --> 00:21:12,803
Good luck.

191
00:24:28,033 --> 00:24:30,356
Look at you!
No, no, yeah, no!

192
00:24:30,602 --> 00:24:32,358
Fuck do you want, tough guy?

193
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:33,193
What's up, what the fuck?

194
00:24:33,439 --> 00:24:35,273
You want some of this?

195
00:24:38,343 --> 00:24:39,565
Get up!

196
00:24:39,811 --> 00:24:41,746
Get the fuck, get over here!

197
00:25:02,434 --> 00:25:06,538
No!

198
00:25:23,188 --> 00:25:24,756
No, no, okay, okay!

199
00:25:26,791 --> 00:25:30,629
I don't got time
for this bullshit!

200
00:25:38,603 --> 00:25:39,892
What the fuck!

201
00:25:40,138 --> 00:25:44,297
What the fuck do you want!

202
00:25:44,543 --> 00:25:46,044
Come get it, then!

203
00:25:51,616 --> 00:25:54,373
Go again?

204
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:55,574
Come on.

205
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:56,988
Yeah? Come on!

206
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:00,713
Shit!

207
00:26:00,959 --> 00:26:01,959
Ah, fuck!

208
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:16,729
Let's go, yeah?

209
00:26:16,975 --> 00:26:17,975
Come on!

210
00:26:30,422 --> 00:26:31,277
Ah, shit!

211
00:26:31,523 --> 00:26:33,959
No, no, don't kill him, no!

212
00:26:36,227 --> 00:26:39,731
No!

213
00:26:52,711 --> 00:26:53,400
Ah, shit!

214
00:26:53,646 --> 00:26:55,568
Get the fuck out of here!

215
00:26:55,814 --> 00:26:56,814
Oh, shit!

216
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:21,239
You hurt bad?

217
00:27:23,041 --> 00:27:24,041
No.

218
00:27:27,779 --> 00:27:29,535
You want to call
the cops or something?

219
00:27:29,781 --> 00:27:30,781
No!

220
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:41,826
Well, let's get
out of here, huh?

221
00:28:05,083 --> 00:28:06,083
Come on.

222
00:28:07,852 --> 00:28:08,852
Come on.

223
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:35,346
You live around here?

224
00:28:36,181 --> 00:28:37,181
Yeah.

225
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:34,928
Hey!

226
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:36,508
Where you goin'?

227
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:53,056
Goddamn it!

228
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:35,948
Are you fucking crazy?

229
00:31:36,194 --> 00:31:37,282
You want to die?

230
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:39,418
If I don't do it he will.

231
00:31:39,664 --> 00:31:41,587
You weren't supposed
to do anything.

232
00:31:41,833 --> 00:31:42,955
You messed it all up.

233
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:46,258
Now, he's gonna kill
me when he sees me.

234
00:31:46,504 --> 00:31:47,093
I'm dead.

235
00:31:47,339 --> 00:31:48,894
I'm already dead.

236
00:31:49,140 --> 00:31:52,164
You were getting your
ass kicked back there.

237
00:31:52,410 --> 00:31:55,067
What was I supposed to do,
just let him do that to you?

238
00:31:55,313 --> 00:31:57,870
Yes, yes, that's what he does.

239
00:31:58,116 --> 00:32:00,139
And now, he's gonna
kill me because of you.

240
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:03,087
You shouldn't have
done anything.

241
00:32:04,522 --> 00:32:06,562
I can't just walk away
from something like that.

242
00:32:15,733 --> 00:32:19,892
Why'd you stop me from
killing that son of a bitch?

243
00:32:20,138 --> 00:32:24,342
I would never want to
see someone die like that.

244
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:29,714
Maybe I should have, because
now he is gonna come for me.

245
00:32:36,154 --> 00:32:38,143
You gotta get out of town.

246
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:39,912
You can't stay.

247
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:42,147
Where will I go?

248
00:32:42,393 --> 00:32:43,393
Anywhere.

249
00:32:46,464 --> 00:32:47,920
I don't have any money.

250
00:32:48,166 --> 00:32:50,055
You make it, don't you?

251
00:32:50,301 --> 00:32:52,991
Isn't that what you're
doing down there?

252
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:55,306
Eddie takes it from me,

253
00:32:57,842 --> 00:33:00,078
Why's he take your money?

254
00:33:02,046 --> 00:33:05,737
Because he doesn't
want me to get high,

255
00:33:05,983 --> 00:33:07,151
but I need it.

256
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:11,176
It's the only way I can
do what he tells me.

257
00:33:11,422 --> 00:33:13,245
I don't like being
myself when I go

258
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,760
with those filthy bastards.

259
00:33:19,330 --> 00:33:22,333
He says the drugs
are gonna ruin me.

260
00:33:23,434 --> 00:33:24,434
Maybe.

261
00:33:25,703 --> 00:33:29,807
Maybe then he will leave me
alone, when nobody wants me.

262
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:33,311
That's your plan?

263
00:33:36,280 --> 00:33:38,116
I don't have a plan.

264
00:33:39,684 --> 00:33:42,074
I just don't want to...

265
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,622
I just don't want
to be used anymore.

266
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:28,332
What's your name?

267
00:34:30,101 --> 00:34:31,169
It's Marie.

268
00:34:32,737 --> 00:34:33,737
I'm Kurt.

269
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:41,279
What are you gonna
do now, Marie?

270
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:43,535
I don't know.

271
00:34:43,781 --> 00:34:46,217
Wherever I go, he'll find me.

272
00:34:51,022 --> 00:34:52,256
I wanna help.

273
00:34:53,858 --> 00:34:54,813
How?

274
00:34:55,059 --> 00:34:56,294
I don't know.

275
00:34:57,728 --> 00:34:59,797
I got you into this shit.

276
00:35:01,132 --> 00:35:04,836
What the hell was I supposed
to do, keep walking?

277
00:35:07,638 --> 00:35:10,141
I shoulda killed that asshole.

278
00:35:11,609 --> 00:35:15,780
I didn't want to watch
someone die in front of me.

279
00:35:20,151 --> 00:35:21,473
You're too soft.

280
00:35:21,719 --> 00:35:24,343
It's them or you, out here.

281
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:25,911
That's how they think,

282
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:28,426
but I won't be one of them.

283
00:35:33,264 --> 00:35:35,266
You don't belong here.

284
00:35:38,336 --> 00:35:40,071
Gotta get outta here.

285
00:35:58,089 --> 00:36:00,324
I got somewhere I gotta be.

286
00:36:02,059 --> 00:36:03,059
Come on.

287
00:36:17,642 --> 00:36:20,632
You gonna be Okay once I leave?

288
00:36:20,878 --> 00:36:22,367
I'll stay here.

289
00:36:22,613 --> 00:36:24,303
He knows you live here?

290
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:27,139
Yes, but he doesn't
know the apartment.

291
00:36:27,385 --> 00:36:30,721
The building is large,
he won't find me.

292
00:36:32,557 --> 00:36:34,479
Wish I could do something.

293
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:38,129
If I had some cash,
I'd put you on a bus.

294
00:36:39,730 --> 00:36:41,566
You could stay here.

295
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:47,705
If Eddie comes back,
you will protect me.

296
00:36:49,974 --> 00:36:50,974
I can't.

297
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:56,935
Then you shouldn't
worry about me.

298
00:36:57,181 --> 00:36:59,438
There's nothing you can do.

299
00:36:59,684 --> 00:37:00,672
When you get some money,

300
00:37:00,918 --> 00:37:01,873
you need to use it
to get out of town.

301
00:37:02,119 --> 00:37:03,387
You understand?

302
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:06,078
I've never left the city.

303
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:07,779
Now you've got to.

304
00:37:08,025 --> 00:37:11,929
You said you were tired
of getting used, right?

305
00:37:13,598 --> 00:37:17,268
If you don't change it,
it's never going to.

306
00:37:26,243 --> 00:37:27,199
This is where I live.

307
00:37:27,445 --> 00:37:29,034
Thanks for walking me home.

308
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,870
You're gonna do
what I said, right:

309
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:35,674
not spend your money on
drugs, and get outta here.

310
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:37,154
Okay, I will.

311
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,418
I wish I hadn't
gotten you into this.

312
00:37:46,664 --> 00:37:49,087
I thought I was fucking
doing something good.

313
00:37:49,333 --> 00:37:50,601
I'll be okay.

314
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:54,205
Just be safe.

315
00:40:27,424 --> 00:40:28,114
Ron.

316
00:40:28,360 --> 00:40:30,515
Is this a good time?

317
00:40:30,761 --> 00:40:32,551
I'm still on my way there.

318
00:40:32,797 --> 00:40:33,952
I can talk.

319
00:40:34,198 --> 00:40:35,053
All right, then.

320
00:40:35,299 --> 00:40:37,289
I've got some good news for you.

321
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:39,791
I heard back about this new job.

322
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:41,526
It's gonna happen, Kurt.

323
00:40:41,772 --> 00:40:45,363
Best thing that's come
to us in a long time.

324
00:40:45,609 --> 00:40:46,698
What is it?

325
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,600
So, there's this guy
in Texas who got ahold

326
00:40:48,846 --> 00:40:50,068
of me through Will.

327
00:40:50,314 --> 00:40:52,971
You know Will, he's
a cop in Houston.

328
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:55,974
So this guy, his name's
Judd, works as a bodyguard

329
00:40:56,220 --> 00:40:57,742
for this Mexican executive,

330
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:00,478
executive of some
big communication
company down there.

331
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:02,647
The guy's pretty loaded.

332
00:41:02,893 --> 00:41:05,350
Now, this executive needs
to go back to Mexico,

333
00:41:05,596 --> 00:41:07,419
but he wants
protection with him,

334
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:08,653
because things are
crazy down there.

335
00:41:08,899 --> 00:41:10,422
Rich people are getting
kidnapped all the time

336
00:41:10,668 --> 00:41:13,358
by the cartels, and
then held for ransom.

337
00:41:13,604 --> 00:41:16,061
So Judd wants to hire some
guys to go down there with him,

338
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:18,129
help protect this
rich Mexican guy,

339
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:21,399
but he only wants guys
with military backgrounds.

340
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:24,148
See where I'm going with this?

341
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:28,473
There could potentially
be some heavy shit,

342
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:30,108
or it could be us just
sitting on our asses,

343
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:32,844
making sure the rich guy's safe.

344
00:41:33,090 --> 00:41:35,480
Either way, the pay is killer.

345
00:41:35,726 --> 00:41:37,816
I didn't think
it was gonna be this big.

346
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:39,150
What's wrong with that?

347
00:41:39,396 --> 00:41:41,052
It means you'll be
working for months.

348
00:41:41,298 --> 00:41:43,588
No more scraping by.

349
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:45,223
How much money?

350
00:41:45,469 --> 00:41:47,926
20 grand a month is
what you'll be making.

351
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,128
Plus, they're putting
us up in a house.

352
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:52,063
How's that sound?

353
00:41:52,309 --> 00:41:53,732
Yeah, that's a lot of money.

354
00:41:53,978 --> 00:41:55,333
You're goddamn right it is.

355
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:58,203
We'll be down there for at
least three months, I was told.

356
00:41:58,449 --> 00:42:00,105
I'm going, too.

357
00:42:00,351 --> 00:42:02,173
Judd wants me to bring
some others down with us,

358
00:42:02,419 --> 00:42:05,110
and I know of a few young
guys who'd be up for this,

359
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:07,178
so I had a thought.

360
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:09,881
You could be in charge
of the other guys,

361
00:42:10,127 --> 00:42:12,183
train 'em for combat and shit.

362
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:15,220
I thought he only
wanted people who served.

363
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,222
Why do they need training?

364
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:19,324
I mean, you and
me were in the Army.

365
00:42:19,570 --> 00:42:21,526
I'll tell him the
younger guys were too.

366
00:42:21,772 --> 00:42:22,927
He won't look into it.

367
00:42:23,173 --> 00:42:24,173
I doubt it.

368
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:29,367
No, I'm not going down
to Mexico to get shot at.

369
00:42:29,613 --> 00:42:32,570
I'm gonna take some
time off after this one.

370
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:36,675
Kurt, you'd be stupid to
pass up on something like this.

371
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:38,243
Now, how long do you
think the five grand

372
00:42:38,489 --> 00:42:40,245
you get from this
one's gonna last?

373
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:41,725
Think about it.

374
00:42:45,296 --> 00:42:48,520
Why'd you tell these kids
what they used to call me?

375
00:42:48,766 --> 00:42:49,821
What's that?

376
00:42:50,067 --> 00:42:53,591
The kids. They knew my
nickname from the Army.

377
00:42:53,837 --> 00:42:55,226
Why'd you tell them that?

378
00:42:55,472 --> 00:42:56,062
So I told them.

379
00:42:56,308 --> 00:42:57,662
What's the big deal?

380
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,999
I don't like hearing about it.

381
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:02,834
Come on, man.

382
00:43:03,080 --> 00:43:04,703
Now, you know how it is.

383
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:07,205
You gotta persuade people.

384
00:43:07,451 --> 00:43:10,942
Now these kids, they've got
a lot of cash that we need,

385
00:43:11,188 --> 00:43:13,611
and they want to know
that you're the real deal.

386
00:43:13,857 --> 00:43:15,780
So I told them about it.

387
00:43:16,026 --> 00:43:17,449
You tell 'em how I got it?

388
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:18,696
Yes I did,

389
00:43:20,097 --> 00:43:22,687
and I wouldn't have if I
didn't think it would help.

390
00:43:22,933 --> 00:43:25,002
But look, we got the job.

391
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:27,604
I think it did help

392
00:43:29,974 --> 00:43:30,862
Now look, I'm sorry
for telling 'em,

393
00:43:31,108 --> 00:43:33,711
but hey, this is a lot of money

394
00:43:36,313 --> 00:43:37,313
You there?

395
00:43:38,615 --> 00:43:42,073
You're wrong if you think I
want to make a living killing.

396
00:43:42,319 --> 00:43:44,154
You got anything else,

397
00:43:45,189 --> 00:43:45,878
let me know.

398
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:47,345
I've been trying to tell you,

399
00:43:47,591 --> 00:43:49,347
we're just gonna be making
sure this guy is safe.

400
00:43:49,593 --> 00:43:51,082
We could get down there
and never fire a shot.

401
00:43:51,328 --> 00:43:52,550
Who knows?

402
00:43:52,796 --> 00:43:56,633
But for this kind of money,
you gotta take a chance.

403
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:01,626
Look, why don't you
take off for a while?

404
00:44:01,872 --> 00:44:04,496
I still gotta work out
some shit with this guy.

405
00:44:04,742 --> 00:44:07,866
It's gonna be a few weeks
before it starts moving.

406
00:44:08,112 --> 00:44:10,869
So why don't you get out of
Palmdale for a week or two?

407
00:44:11,115 --> 00:44:12,115
Relax.

408
00:44:12,816 --> 00:44:14,506
Spend some of that cash.

409
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:16,307
Then I'll call you
when the deal's ready,

410
00:44:16,553 --> 00:44:18,076
and we can start
making some real money.

411
00:44:18,322 --> 00:44:19,322
How's that?

412
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:21,613
Yeah.

413
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:22,860
All right.

414
00:44:23,727 --> 00:44:24,983
This is gonna work out, man.

415
00:44:25,229 --> 00:44:27,585
You've got nothing
to worry about.

416
00:44:27,831 --> 00:44:30,755
Now, give me a call when
you're on the train back here.

417
00:44:31,001 --> 00:44:32,001
See ya.

418
00:46:37,461 --> 00:46:38,716
She's fuckin' me down.

419
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:42,053
She's got this fuckin' faggot
boyfriend on the corner.

420
00:46:42,299 --> 00:46:43,254
What the fuck's he
doin' on this side

421
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:47,104
of the.

422
00:47:20,837 --> 00:47:22,806
I'm fuckin' drunk.

423
00:47:26,076 --> 00:47:29,079
Yeah, who the fuck cares?

424
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:45,416
Alright, bro, I'm gonna
fuckin' go call Elizabeth up.

425
00:47:45,662 --> 00:47:47,831
Yeah, you know, I'm sorry.

426
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:52,690
All right, bro, I'm out now.

427
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:53,625
Last chance.

428
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:54,892
Over a fuckin' girl.

429
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:56,138
Have fun.

430
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:58,374
Peace.

431
00:48:18,195 --> 00:48:19,196
Whoa, buddy.

432
00:48:20,063 --> 00:48:21,331
You're Marty?

433
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:25,435
Yeah, who's asking?

434
00:48:45,789 --> 00:48:49,359
No, don't kill him, no!

435
00:49:32,569 --> 00:49:35,226
You scream and I'm
gonna cut you up.

436
00:49:35,472 --> 00:49:37,395
Okay, okay, I won't.

437
00:49:37,641 --> 00:49:39,076
What do you want?

438
00:49:43,246 --> 00:49:44,481
I don't know.

439
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:54,791
Adam and Michael.

440
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:57,949
What?

441
00:49:58,195 --> 00:50:00,464
You know them, don't you?

442
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,956
Yeah, what do they
have to do with you?

443
00:50:05,202 --> 00:50:07,825
They paid me to kill you.

444
00:50:08,071 --> 00:50:09,071
What?

445
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:13,944
You took their money, right?

446
00:50:16,513 --> 00:50:18,415
I'm not fucking around!

447
00:50:19,282 --> 00:50:19,872
Yeah!

448
00:50:20,118 --> 00:50:22,052
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

449
00:50:23,720 --> 00:50:24,609
Yeah, I took their money.

450
00:50:24,855 --> 00:50:26,677
You're gonna give me that.

451
00:50:26,923 --> 00:50:30,848
You're buying back your
life, you understand?

452
00:50:31,094 --> 00:50:35,265
I'm gonna let you live, but if
you try to get away from me,

453
00:50:38,001 --> 00:50:38,789
you'll be sorry.

454
00:50:39,035 --> 00:50:41,071
Yeah, okay, okay, okay.

455
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:43,774
Where's your car?

456
00:50:45,842 --> 00:50:47,064
It's over there.

457
00:50:47,310 --> 00:50:48,310
Go.

458
00:51:10,700 --> 00:51:11,700
Hey.

459
00:51:13,303 --> 00:51:15,972
Bring that out of there, slowly.

460
00:51:17,674 --> 00:51:19,743
What, it's just a shoe.

461
00:51:34,291 --> 00:51:38,061
Chill, all right, I
wasn't gonna do anything.

462
00:51:39,496 --> 00:51:40,718
Oh, shit!

463
00:51:40,964 --> 00:51:42,019
It's my gun, now.

464
00:51:42,265 --> 00:51:43,265
Get up.

465
00:51:54,511 --> 00:51:55,979
Where's the money?

466
00:52:11,361 --> 00:52:12,361
Open it.

467
00:52:45,395 --> 00:52:47,230
Take me back downtown.

468
00:53:22,432 --> 00:53:23,833
How much is here?

469
00:53:26,903 --> 00:53:28,805
A little over 90,000.

470
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:37,935
How much are they
paying you to kill me?

471
00:53:38,181 --> 00:53:39,181
10.

472
00:53:40,550 --> 00:53:41,550
10 grand?

473
00:53:45,288 --> 00:53:47,712
I just emptied their
accounts a month ago.

474
00:53:47,958 --> 00:53:50,047
Do you have any idea how
hard it is to make 10 grand

475
00:53:50,293 --> 00:53:52,450
in that amount of time?

476
00:53:52,696 --> 00:53:55,419
My God, they're really
trying to kill me.

477
00:53:55,665 --> 00:53:57,822
How long did it take
'em to make this much?

478
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,068
Two years.

479
00:54:01,004 --> 00:54:02,272
I'd kill you.

480
00:54:13,516 --> 00:54:14,516
Hm.

481
00:54:25,261 --> 00:54:26,696
It's your friend.

482
00:54:36,172 --> 00:54:38,441
Why'd you take it from 'em?

483
00:54:39,576 --> 00:54:41,432
Can't trust anyone.

484
00:54:41,678 --> 00:54:44,101
Michael and
Adam thought that just

485
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:46,570
because we were
working together,

486
00:54:46,816 --> 00:54:49,039
that I wouldn't go snooping
around their accounts.

487
00:54:49,285 --> 00:54:51,675
And when I saw all
that fucking money,

488
00:54:51,921 --> 00:54:53,744
man, I didn't hesitate.

489
00:54:53,990 --> 00:54:56,013
I mean, we do this all
the time to other people.

490
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:59,850
What makes, what makes
them so special, you know?

491
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:01,318
What, we're friends?

492
00:55:01,564 --> 00:55:03,687
Go fuck yourself.

493
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:07,758
That's why I keep mine in
cash, because if it's online,

494
00:55:08,004 --> 00:55:10,227
it's there for the taking.

495
00:55:10,473 --> 00:55:12,830
I appreciate you
keeping it in cash.

496
00:55:13,076 --> 00:55:14,511
Yeah, fuck you.

497
00:55:20,483 --> 00:55:21,405
I can't believe
those two faggots

498
00:55:21,651 --> 00:55:24,608
would pull something like this.

499
00:55:24,854 --> 00:55:25,854
Hiring you?

500
00:55:27,323 --> 00:55:28,913
It surprises me, really.

501
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,949
Those two are some
uptight pussies.

502
00:55:32,195 --> 00:55:34,698
How long until we get there?

503
00:55:35,865 --> 00:55:38,968
I don't know, like,
another 10 minutes.

504
00:55:41,504 --> 00:55:43,260
Hey man, let me
ask you something.

505
00:55:43,506 --> 00:55:44,506
What?

506
00:55:49,212 --> 00:55:52,982
Those two assholes
were paying you 10 grand

507
00:55:54,651 --> 00:55:58,822
to snuff me out, and you
just got over 90,000 from me.

508
00:56:00,423 --> 00:56:02,379
You were buying
your life, remember?

509
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:04,894
Yeah, and I'll take that,

510
00:56:07,363 --> 00:56:10,721
but those two are gonna keep
coming after me for what I did.

511
00:56:10,967 --> 00:56:12,923
You know, they're
not gonna stop,

512
00:56:13,169 --> 00:56:17,895
and they're only gonna get
more desperate, you know?

513
00:56:18,141 --> 00:56:22,312
So why don't you consider that
payment to go and do them?

514
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:27,171
Why the fuck would I do that?

515
00:56:27,417 --> 00:56:28,439
I've got the money.

516
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:31,275
Come on man, that's
a lot of fucking cash.

517
00:56:31,521 --> 00:56:33,177
I mean, just go over there,

518
00:56:33,423 --> 00:56:36,247
and then, at least,
fuck them up, you know?

519
00:56:36,493 --> 00:56:38,228
Do me that one favor.

520
00:56:39,395 --> 00:56:40,451
Come on, man, you
took my piece, too.

521
00:56:40,697 --> 00:56:42,319
You're leaving me
with nothing here.

522
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:43,354
Shut up.

523
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:46,102
This is some fucked up shit!

524
00:57:23,907 --> 00:57:25,909
All right, I'll do it.

525
00:57:31,147 --> 00:57:32,147
You will?

526
00:57:33,450 --> 00:57:36,286
You know where
they live, right?

527
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:39,622
Yeah, yeah, I do

528
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:01,165
So, you gonna use my gun?

529
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:03,233
Pistol whip them?

530
00:58:03,479 --> 00:58:06,103
You know, I got a
crowbar in the back.

531
00:58:06,349 --> 00:58:08,405
Give me your license.

532
00:58:08,651 --> 00:58:09,907
Why?

533
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:13,577
They won't let me in if
I don't show it to them.

534
00:58:13,823 --> 00:58:15,279
That was the deal.

535
00:58:15,525 --> 00:58:17,314
You're taking
everything from me.

536
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:19,984
What, do you want my car, too?

537
00:58:20,230 --> 00:58:22,966
You want me to
do this, or not?

538
00:58:29,439 --> 00:58:32,342
It was gonna
expire soon, anyway.

539
00:58:35,612 --> 00:58:37,413
Hey, I never got your name!

540
00:58:53,396 --> 00:58:54,085
Hello?

541
00:58:54,331 --> 00:58:55,886
Hey, it's me, I'm down here.

542
00:58:56,132 --> 00:58:56,821
You were supposed to call

543
00:58:57,067 --> 00:58:57,822
when you were on your way back.

544
00:58:58,068 --> 00:58:58,822
What took so long?

545
00:58:59,068 --> 00:58:59,724
I forgot.

546
00:58:59,970 --> 00:59:00,970
Open the door

547
00:59:22,725 --> 00:59:23,993
Any problems?

548
00:59:26,963 --> 00:59:27,751
No.

549
00:59:27,997 --> 00:59:28,998
It was easy.

550
00:59:31,534 --> 00:59:32,257
He had a tiny neck.

551
00:59:32,503 --> 00:59:34,404
Snapped like a chicken.

552
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:36,605
Whoa.

553
00:59:38,808 --> 00:59:42,312
I'll take my money
now and be on my way.

554
00:59:46,349 --> 00:59:47,771
Call Marty's phone.

555
00:59:48,017 --> 00:59:48,772
Why?

556
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:50,340
Yeah, why?

557
00:59:50,586 --> 00:59:52,009
That's not enough proof for you?

558
00:59:52,255 --> 00:59:53,677
No, it's not.

559
00:59:53,923 --> 00:59:56,259
Call Marty's phone, Michael.

560
00:59:58,928 --> 01:00:00,863
You're asking for it.

561
01:00:03,266 --> 01:00:05,168
Hello?
He answered.

562
01:00:06,102 --> 01:00:07,257
Hello?
Hello?

563
01:00:07,503 --> 01:00:09,572
Who's there?

564
01:00:10,707 --> 01:00:12,262
Who's there?

565
01:00:12,508 --> 01:00:14,110
Hello?

566
01:00:16,212 --> 01:00:19,482
No, that's not
Marty's phone anymore.

567
01:00:36,265 --> 01:00:37,867
What was it like?

568
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:41,069
Killing him?

569
01:00:45,308 --> 01:00:46,776
I wouldn't know.

570
01:00:48,044 --> 01:00:51,001
What the fuck does that mean?

571
01:00:51,247 --> 01:00:52,269
Shit!

572
01:00:52,515 --> 01:00:55,639
That means that
Marty's still alive,

573
01:00:55,885 --> 01:00:59,243
and he paid me all that money
to come up here and kill you.

574
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,712
And I'm gonna use this
gun he gave me to do it,

575
01:01:01,958 --> 01:01:04,014
because that's
what you do, right?

576
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:05,762
You're the expert.

577
01:01:06,863 --> 01:01:07,452
Right?

578
01:01:07,698 --> 01:01:09,653
No, please, please.

579
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:11,421
Please, don't.

580
01:01:11,667 --> 01:01:14,825
I'd blow your head off for
free, you little asshole.

581
01:01:15,071 --> 01:01:16,072
No.

582
01:01:30,153 --> 01:01:32,655
You two stay out of trouble.

583
01:01:40,363 --> 01:01:41,363
Oh, man.

584
01:01:44,000 --> 01:01:45,334
Adam, are you all right?

585
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:27,197
This is the
address, sir, you gave me.

586
01:02:27,443 --> 01:02:28,444
Wait here.

587
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:55,271
Marie, it's Kurt

588
01:03:02,979 --> 01:03:03,979
Kurt?

589
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:07,237
What are you doing here?

590
01:03:07,483 --> 01:03:09,051
Did he come here?

591
01:03:10,386 --> 01:03:12,209
No, but he's been
calling and making threats.

592
01:03:12,455 --> 01:03:13,277
He says terrible things.

593
01:03:13,523 --> 01:03:14,912
I'm so afraid.
Goddamn it.

594
01:03:15,158 --> 01:03:17,147
Listen, I'm gonna
get you out of here.

595
01:03:17,393 --> 01:03:19,295
That's why I came back.

596
01:03:20,696 --> 01:03:21,518
Out of here?

597
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:23,086
What are you talking about?

598
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:25,656
I'm gonna get on a bus and
get the hell out of here.

599
01:03:25,902 --> 01:03:28,058
You need to come with me.

600
01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:30,794
I fucked things up
for you real bad,

601
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:33,442
and I wanna to make it right.

602
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:40,504
Earlier, I couldn't do
anything, but now I can.

603
01:03:40,750 --> 01:03:42,818
You need to come with me.

604
01:03:44,253 --> 01:03:46,910
You want me to just
leave, right now?

605
01:03:47,156 --> 01:03:48,445
There's no telling
when that son of a bitch

606
01:03:48,691 --> 01:03:51,448
is gonna come looking for you.

607
01:03:51,694 --> 01:03:54,630
I'm not gonna wait
around for that.

608
01:04:02,138 --> 01:04:03,138
No.

609
01:04:05,274 --> 01:04:07,464
It won't do any good.

610
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:09,312
What do you mean?

611
01:04:11,681 --> 01:04:14,204
You shouldn't have come back.

612
01:04:14,450 --> 01:04:15,952
You don't know me.

613
01:04:18,888 --> 01:04:20,711
You take all the
blame for all of this

614
01:04:20,957 --> 01:04:25,127
and maybe it would have
happened with or without you.

615
01:04:32,668 --> 01:04:34,170
Maybe I am doomed.

616
01:04:36,606 --> 01:04:40,776
So then, what difference
would it make where I go?

617
01:04:44,113 --> 01:04:45,369
I don't know what the
hell you're talking about,

618
01:04:45,615 --> 01:04:50,173
or why, but I've already
saved your life once tonight.

619
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:51,419
Remember?

620
01:04:52,655 --> 01:04:54,323
You were gonna jump.

621
01:05:08,004 --> 01:05:11,607
I know what it's like
to live without hope.

622
01:05:14,143 --> 01:05:15,711
You get used to it.

623
01:05:19,815 --> 01:05:23,986
I've done so many things I
can't change, terrible things.

624
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:30,881
I started to just
wish that I'd die,

625
01:05:31,127 --> 01:05:35,298
that something would come
along and just take me out.

626
01:05:36,632 --> 01:05:39,702
And tonight, I made
it worse for you.

627
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:50,513
Right now, I know that
I've gotta do this.

628
01:05:51,647 --> 01:05:54,817
I need to fix what
I've gotten you into.

629
01:05:59,689 --> 01:06:02,725
Things are gonna be
different, Marie.

630
01:06:03,793 --> 01:06:04,793
I swear it.

631
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:10,733
Let me do this one right thing.

632
01:06:17,773 --> 01:06:21,231
How many times can
you save my life?

633
01:06:21,477 --> 01:06:23,934
As many as I need to.

634
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,414
You saved mine.

635
01:06:29,752 --> 01:06:31,341
I'll explain later.

636
01:06:31,587 --> 01:06:33,043
You need to start
packing your things.

637
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:37,460
Let's get the hell out of
here before Eddie shows up.

638
01:06:54,243 --> 01:06:56,746
Will you give me 10 minutes?

639
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:43,446
Where to now, sir?

640
01:07:43,692 --> 01:07:45,215
Bus station.

641
01:07:45,461 --> 01:07:47,517
You've got to get
your things, don't you?

642
01:07:47,763 --> 01:07:50,366
Nothing worth going back for.

643
01:08:06,882 --> 01:08:08,150
Here, hold this

644
01:08:09,318 --> 01:08:10,041
Oh, my God.

645
01:08:10,287 --> 01:08:12,521
Where did you get all this?

646
01:08:18,060 --> 01:08:19,349
Yeah?

647
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:21,351
Those two kids called
me saying you broke the deal.

648
01:08:21,597 --> 01:08:24,187
They said Marty's still alive,
and you pulled a gun on them.

649
01:08:24,433 --> 01:08:25,689
Is that true?

650
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:28,037
Stop here for a second.

651
01:08:32,141 --> 01:08:33,129
Kurt, what
the hell is going on?

652
01:08:33,375 --> 01:08:34,297
Answer me!

653
01:08:34,543 --> 01:08:36,278
Did you fuck this up?

654
01:08:48,624 --> 01:08:51,181
What'd you do that for?

655
01:08:51,427 --> 01:08:52,761
Don't need it.

656
01:08:58,100 --> 01:09:00,056
We got a long bus
ride ahead of us.

657
01:09:00,302 --> 01:09:02,505
I'll tell you all about it.

658
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:05,608
Where are we gonna go?

659
01:09:13,782 --> 01:09:15,351
Anywhere we want.
