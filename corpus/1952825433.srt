AS GETTING GOOD GRADES ¶

DONE WRONG ¶

8

36
00:02:00,486 --> 00:02:03,205
- I'M ARTHUR,
AND I SLAY DRAGONS.

00:02:03,206 --> 00:02:04,422
THAT'S TIM.

38
00:02:04,423 --> 00:02:05,673
- YOU IDIOT.

39
00:02:05,674 --> 00:02:07,375
- WE'RE BEST FRIENDS.

40
00:02:07,376 --> 00:02:08,676
THAT'S NATALIE.

41
00:02:08,677 --> 00:02:10,095
- OH!

42
00:02:10,096 --> 00:02:11,379
YOU DWEEBS.

43
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:12,848
- SHE'S CRAZY ABOUT ME.

44
00:02:12,849 --> 00:02:16,901
WE'RE THE KNIGHTS
OF THE SQUARE TABLE.

45
00:02:16,902 --> 00:02:18,854
WE WENT LOOKING
FOR A MONSTER...

46
00:02:18,855 --> 00:02:22,390
- [screaming]

47
00:02:24,277 --> 00:02:27,378
- AND, BOY,
DID WE FIND ONE.

48
00:02:28,781 --> 00:02:30,581
both:
SHH.

49
00:02:30,582 --> 00:02:32,466
- WHAT IS THAT?

50
00:02:32,467 --> 00:02:34,002
GET ME OUT OF HERE.
GET ME OUT.

51
00:02:34,003 --> 00:02:36,705
- QUIET, QUIET.
- SHH.

52
00:02:36,706 --> 00:02:39,640
[pounding on door]

53
00:02:45,915 --> 00:02:47,398
- WAIT. WAIT. WAIT.
WAIT A MINUTE.

54
00:02:47,399 --> 00:02:49,367
I THINK I'M GETTING AHEAD
OF MYSELF.

55
00:02:49,368 --> 00:02:52,003
LET ME TELL YOU
HOW THIS WHOLE THING STARTED.

56
00:03:08,787 --> 00:03:10,788
I THINK SOMETHING'S OUT THERE.

57
00:03:10,789 --> 00:03:12,857
- IT'S PROBABLY JUST BULLIES.

58
00:03:12,858 --> 00:03:15,626
- WE SHOULD LEAVE
BEFORE WE GET WEDGIED.

59
00:03:19,198 --> 00:03:21,449
I THINK I HEAR
MY MOTHER CALLING ME.

60
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:24,101
- UH, I THINK
SHE'S CALLING ME TOO.

61
00:03:24,102 --> 00:03:26,671
[growling noise]

62
00:03:30,676 --> 00:03:32,510
- COME ON, PUNK.

63
00:03:32,511 --> 00:03:34,379
THOUGHT YOU COULD GET AWAY,
DIDN'T YOU?

64
00:03:37,316 --> 00:03:38,967
- METZ.

65
00:03:38,968 --> 00:03:41,219
- IF IT ISN'T QUEEN ARTHUR.

66
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:42,520
GRENDEL, DOWN.

67
00:03:42,521 --> 00:03:45,774
THIS ONE
MIGHT GIVE YOU RABIES.

68
00:03:45,775 --> 00:03:48,026
OH, A GIFT.

69
00:03:48,027 --> 00:03:49,311
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU CARED.

70
00:03:49,312 --> 00:03:50,978
- THEY'RE MINE.

71
00:03:50,979 --> 00:03:52,864
- DON'T TRY TO BE A HERO,
NUMBNUTS.

72
00:03:52,865 --> 00:03:54,232
- THAT'S ELIXIR, SIR.

73
00:03:54,233 --> 00:03:56,751
IT'S A COLLECTIBLE CARD GAME,
FANTASY-BASED,

74
00:03:56,752 --> 00:03:58,102
PLAYED BY MATHLETES, MISFITS,

75
00:03:58,103 --> 00:04:00,504
AND THOSE PICKED LAST
FOR KICKBALL.

76
00:04:03,225 --> 00:04:07,679
- "DARKSMOKE:
EVIL DRAGON LORD,

77
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,050
ARCHENEMA OF TOBAR
THE GOLDEN DRAGON."

78
00:04:12,051 --> 00:04:13,868
- I THINK THAT'S "ENEMY."

79
00:04:13,869 --> 00:04:15,637
- I CAN READ, MORON.

80
00:04:15,638 --> 00:04:16,621
- DARKSMOKE'S BAD.

81
00:04:16,622 --> 00:04:17,722
- THAT CARD'S RARE.

82
00:04:17,723 --> 00:04:19,341
IT'S WORTH 10 BUCKS.

83
00:04:19,342 --> 00:04:20,675
- 10 BUCKS, EH?

84
00:04:20,676 --> 00:04:23,928
BET IT'D LOOK MIGHTY FINE
IN THE SPOKES OF MY BIKE.

85
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:26,197
- WHOA.
- WHOA.

86
00:04:26,198 --> 00:04:28,066
- YOU LIKE TO PLAY GAMES,
QUEEN ARTHUR?

87
00:04:28,067 --> 00:04:29,351
WELL, I GOT
A GAME FOR YOU.

88
00:04:29,352 --> 00:04:31,085
IT'S CALLED "PIÑATA BOY."

89
00:04:34,940 --> 00:04:36,691
[screaming]

90
00:04:36,692 --> 00:04:37,792
AH, I'M BLIND.

91
00:04:37,793 --> 00:04:38,926
I'VE BEEN SLIMED.

92
00:04:38,927 --> 00:04:40,144
GET HIM.

93
00:04:40,145 --> 00:04:41,462
I'M BLIND.
[screaming]

94
00:04:41,463 --> 00:04:42,497
- BACK HERE.

95
00:04:42,498 --> 00:04:43,781
- GET HIM.

96
00:04:43,782 --> 00:04:47,002
- YOU ALL RIGHT, MAN?

97
00:04:47,003 --> 00:04:48,352
- I'M GONNA GET THAT KID.

98
00:04:50,405 --> 00:04:51,639
- WHY'D YOU PULL ME BACK?

99
00:04:51,640 --> 00:04:52,640
- DO YOU WANT ME TO ANSWER THAT,

100
00:04:52,641 --> 00:04:54,242
OR DO YOU WANT ME
TO GET BELLIGERENT?

101
00:04:54,243 --> 00:04:55,025
- NEITHER.

102
00:04:55,026 --> 00:04:56,110
GOOD SHOOTIN', TEX.

103
00:04:56,111 --> 00:04:58,112
- THANKS.
- LET'S GO.

104
00:05:02,385 --> 00:05:05,286
- [grumbling]

105
00:05:08,707 --> 00:05:10,742
[whistle blows]

106
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,110
- A WHISTLE, REALLY?

107
00:05:12,111 --> 00:05:14,244
[whistle blows]

108
00:05:16,314 --> 00:05:18,833
- I HAVE WORKED AT THIS JOB
LONG ENOUGH

109
00:05:18,834 --> 00:05:22,470
TO BE ABLE TO SPOT L.O.D.
WHEN I SEE IT.

110
00:05:22,471 --> 00:05:24,138
A LOD.

111
00:05:24,139 --> 00:05:27,242
- L.O.D.:
LACK OF DISCIPLINE.

112
00:05:27,243 --> 00:05:30,795
SINGLE MOM
WORKING LATE NIGHTS,

113
00:05:30,796 --> 00:05:33,731
EVEN LATER NIGHTS
WITH HER BOYFRIEND.

114
00:05:33,732 --> 00:05:35,299
[scoffs]

115
00:05:35,300 --> 00:05:37,068
SO SAD.

116
00:05:37,069 --> 00:05:39,603
WHAT WITH OUR CUSTODY HEARING
COMING UP,

117
00:05:39,604 --> 00:05:41,906
I WOULD THINK THAT YOU WOULD
CARE A LITTLE MORE

118
00:05:41,907 --> 00:05:44,475
ABOUT PUBLIC PERCEPTION.

119
00:05:44,476 --> 00:05:47,211
- HOW DID YOU KNOW
ABOUT MY CUSTODY HEARING?

120
00:05:56,272 --> 00:05:57,655
- DAD?
- LAURA.

121
00:05:57,656 --> 00:05:59,023
- MRS. METZ.
- LAURA.

122
00:05:59,024 --> 00:06:00,275
- MOM.
- ARTHUR.

123
00:06:00,276 --> 00:06:01,609
- METZ.
- ART.

124
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,777
- ANNIE.
- ART.

125
00:06:02,778 --> 00:06:04,913
- ARTHUR.

126
00:06:04,914 --> 00:06:06,664
- WELL,
NOW THAT WE'RE ALL HERE,

127
00:06:06,665 --> 00:06:10,085
WHO SHALL TAKE THE CHILD?

128
00:06:10,086 --> 00:06:14,506
- LAURA, DO YOU REALLY THINK
YOU'RE FIT TO BE A GOOD MOTHER?

129
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:16,574
- WELL, SEE,
THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS, ART,

130
00:06:16,575 --> 00:06:19,978
WHEN PEOPLE DON'T TIVO OPRAH
OR DR. PHIL

131
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:22,313
OR DR. LAURA SCHLESSIN--
SCHLESS--

132
00:06:22,314 --> 00:06:23,882
DR. LAURA.

133
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,718
- LAURA, YOU'RE NOT FIT
TO BE HIS MOTHER.

134
00:06:26,719 --> 00:06:29,253
YOU DON'T TIVO ANYTHING.

135
00:06:29,254 --> 00:06:30,855
- WHAT? TIVO?

136
00:06:30,856 --> 00:06:32,974
WHAT UNIVERSE
IS SHE A FIT MOTHER?

137
00:06:32,975 --> 00:06:34,208
- ALL RIGHT, LAURA,

138
00:06:34,209 --> 00:06:37,111
YOU'RE GONNA NEED TO CHECK
YOUR TONE-AGE WITH ME, OKAY?

139
00:06:37,112 --> 00:06:38,880
BECAUSE I AM
THE SECOND ASSISTANT

140
00:06:38,881 --> 00:06:42,066
OF THE SERGEANT BATTALION,
SWING SHIFT,

141
00:06:42,067 --> 00:06:45,153
AND IN ADDITION
TO HELPING THE PUBLIC,

142
00:06:45,154 --> 00:06:49,874
I HAPPEN TO HAVE VERY STRONG
MOTHERING INSTINCTS.

143
00:06:49,875 --> 00:06:51,826
I'VE BEEN KNOWN TO RAISE
WILD RABBITS

144
00:06:51,827 --> 00:06:54,162
AND PUPPIES,
REMEMBER?

145
00:06:54,163 --> 00:06:55,429
- THE PUPPIES.

146
00:06:55,430 --> 00:06:58,532
- PUPPIES, LOTS OF PUPPIES
AND SOME STRAY FELINES

147
00:06:58,533 --> 00:07:00,668
AND A CAT, EVEN.

148
00:07:00,669 --> 00:07:02,353
- DID YOU HEAR THAT, ARTHUR?
SHE'S RAISED A CAT.

149
00:07:02,354 --> 00:07:04,889
MAYBE SHE'LL TEACH YOU
HOW TO PEE IN A BOX.

150
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:06,123
- YOU BETTER BE CAREFUL.

151
00:07:06,124 --> 00:07:07,592
YOU'RE TALKING
TO AN AUTHORITARIAN.

152
00:07:07,593 --> 00:07:08,693
- [tutting]

153
00:07:10,763 --> 00:07:14,232
ARTHUR,

154
00:07:14,233 --> 00:07:15,666
WHO DO YOU WANT TO LIVE WITH?

155
00:07:19,437 --> 00:07:22,073
- ME?

156
00:07:22,074 --> 00:07:24,275
- OKAY, THIS IS JUST RIDICULOUS.

157
00:07:24,276 --> 00:07:26,310
- MRS. LYLE,
CAN YOU HONESTLY CLAIM

158
00:07:26,311 --> 00:07:29,614
TO PROVIDE A HEALTHY ENVIRONMENT
FOR YOUR SON?

159
00:07:29,615 --> 00:07:32,500
I MEAN,
THE BOY IS CLEARLY MISGUIDED.

160
00:07:32,501 --> 00:07:34,836
HE HAS YET TO OFFER AN APOLOGY
TO MY LITTLE LARRY.

161
00:07:34,837 --> 00:07:36,620
- APOLOGIZE?

162
00:07:40,275 --> 00:07:43,227
OKAY, MRS. METZ,

163
00:07:43,228 --> 00:07:44,962
YOUR MOST ROYAL
EXALTED HIGHNESS,

164
00:07:44,963 --> 00:07:47,715
I APOLOGIZE.

165
00:07:47,716 --> 00:07:49,717
I APOLOGIZE
THAT SOMEONE SAW FIT

166
00:07:49,718 --> 00:07:52,119
TO PUT YOU
INTO A POSITION OF AUTHORITY

167
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:56,975
WHEN YOUR OWN SON
OBVIOUSLY HAS AN L.O.D. PROBLEM,

168
00:07:56,976 --> 00:07:59,277
AND I SINCERELY APOLOGIZE
THAT MY ARTHUR

169
00:07:59,278 --> 00:08:03,947
DIDN'T CAUSE MORE HARM
TO YOUR LITTLE TYRANT

170
00:08:03,948 --> 00:08:06,818
THAN TO HURT
HIS OVERPRICED DESIGNER CLOTHES,

171
00:08:06,819 --> 00:08:09,803
AND IF HE EVER BULLIES
MY SON AGAIN,

172
00:08:09,804 --> 00:08:13,741
I SWEAR I WILL SHOW HIM
NO LACK OF DISCIPLINE.

173
00:08:16,045 --> 00:08:17,412
- [shrieks]

174
00:08:17,413 --> 00:08:19,247
- AND YOU WERE WRONG
ABOUT THE BOYFRIEND THING.

175
00:08:19,248 --> 00:08:21,249
[whistle blows]

176
00:08:21,250 --> 00:08:22,800
LET'S GO.

177
00:08:25,137 --> 00:08:26,153
YOU OWE ME.

178
00:08:26,154 --> 00:08:27,589
- FOR WHAT?

179
00:08:27,590 --> 00:08:29,591
- THREE DAYS' VACATION.

180
00:08:29,592 --> 00:08:31,292
- IT'S CALLED A SUSPENSION.

181
00:08:31,293 --> 00:08:34,345
- IT'S ONLY CALLED A SUSPENSION
IF YOU DID SOMETHING WRONG.

182
00:08:34,346 --> 00:08:35,647
LOOK, DON'T WORRY, KIDDO.

183
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,081
I WILL HANDLE IT.

184
00:08:37,082 --> 00:08:39,050
- THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF.

185
00:08:39,051 --> 00:08:40,985
- AH...

186
00:08:40,986 --> 00:08:43,187
BREAK OUT YOUR POCKET PROTECTOR,
BECAUSE I GOT YOU TICKETS

187
00:08:43,188 --> 00:08:47,157
TO THE BIGGEST ELIXIR QUEST
CONVENTION IN THE WORLD.

188
00:08:47,158 --> 00:08:48,258
- NO WAY.

189
00:08:48,259 --> 00:08:49,393
- YEAH.

190
00:08:49,394 --> 00:08:51,161
- TIM'S GONNA PEE HIS PANTS.

191
00:08:51,162 --> 00:08:52,896
SHANE BARKER'S GONNA BE THERE.

192
00:08:52,897 --> 00:08:54,031
- WHO?

193
00:08:54,032 --> 00:08:55,833
- HE'S THE ELIXIR QUEST
GAME DESIGNER.

194
00:08:55,834 --> 00:08:58,453
HE'S UNVEILING
A NEW EXPANSION DECK.

195
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,904
- OH, IS HE CUTE?

196
00:08:59,905 --> 00:09:02,406
- PERMISSION TO BARF.

197
00:09:02,407 --> 00:09:03,574
- DENIED, SOLDIER.

198
00:09:03,575 --> 00:09:05,809
I JUST GOT THE OLD SHOE SMELL
OUT OF THIS CAR.

199
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:09,313
I AM NOT IN THE MARKET
FOR A NEW ODOR.

200
00:09:09,314 --> 00:09:12,800
LOOK, HONEY,
THERE'S SOME SMALL PRINT.

201
00:09:12,801 --> 00:09:14,168
OH, HERE IT COMES.

202
00:09:14,169 --> 00:09:16,353
- NO SEWERS.

203
00:09:16,354 --> 00:09:17,572
- BUT, MOM--

204
00:09:17,573 --> 00:09:18,539
- THEY'RE DISGUSTING.

205
00:09:18,540 --> 00:09:20,341
THAT'S WHY THEY'RE CALLED
A SEWER.

206
00:09:20,342 --> 00:09:22,509
HAVEN'T YOU SEEN THAT MOVIE
WITH THE ALLIGATOR?

207
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:24,112
ARRRGH.

208
00:09:27,516 --> 00:09:30,667
YEAH, WELL, LOOK,

209
00:09:30,668 --> 00:09:32,236
THERE'S SOME HOT POCKETS
IN THE FREEZER,

210
00:09:32,237 --> 00:09:35,006
AND IF YOU'RE STILL HUNGRY,
WE'VE GOT FIG NEWTONS.

211
00:09:35,007 --> 00:09:36,006
- MMM.

212
00:09:36,007 --> 00:09:37,041
[laughs]

213
00:09:37,042 --> 00:09:38,976
- GIVE ME A KISS.
- WHAT?

214
00:09:38,977 --> 00:09:42,045
- HURRY UP.
I'M LATE FOR WORK.

215
00:09:42,046 --> 00:09:44,181
- BYE, MOM.
- NO SEWER.

216
00:09:44,182 --> 00:09:46,033
- SO THE TUNNEL
HAS THREE CORRIDORS:

217
00:09:46,034 --> 00:09:49,220
HERE, HERE, AND HERE.

218
00:09:49,221 --> 00:09:50,388
WE'LL SPLIT UP.

219
00:09:50,389 --> 00:09:51,923
- CAN I GO WITH YOU?

220
00:09:51,924 --> 00:09:53,424
- YEAH,
EXCEPT THAT WOULD KIND OF RUIN

221
00:09:53,425 --> 00:09:55,159
THE WHOLE SPLITTING UP THING.

222
00:09:56,478 --> 00:09:57,778
WE EACH TAKE A WING.

223
00:09:57,779 --> 00:09:59,246
WHEN WE HEAR IT,

224
00:09:59,247 --> 00:10:01,849
WE CLOSE IN
AND TRAP THE MONSTER BETWEEN US.

225
00:10:01,850 --> 00:10:04,184
- WE'RE ACTUALLY GONNA MOVE
TOWARD THE MONSTER?

226
00:10:04,185 --> 00:10:06,453
WOULD NOT HAPPEN IN MY PLAN.

227
00:10:06,454 --> 00:10:08,022
- WE'RE THE KNIGHTS
OF THE SQUARE TABLE.

228
00:10:08,023 --> 00:10:09,991
WE CAN'T PASS UP A CHANCE
TO SEE A MONSTER.

229
00:10:09,992 --> 00:10:11,125
- LET'S GET ON WITH THIS.

230
00:10:11,126 --> 00:10:12,393
I'M ROGUE.

231
00:10:12,394 --> 00:10:15,596
MY PARENTS THINK I AM
SELLING COOKIES TILL 8:00.

232
00:10:20,085 --> 00:10:22,653
- KEEP THESE WALKIES ON,
CONSTANT CONTACT,

233
00:10:22,654 --> 00:10:23,854
AND NO NAPPING.

234
00:10:30,346 --> 00:10:31,896
WE MIGHT BE DEALING
WITH A MAN-EATER.

235
00:10:59,074 --> 00:11:01,092
- GO.
- YOU GO.

236
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:02,093
- I'LL GO.

237
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:03,527
- GO.

238
00:11:03,528 --> 00:11:04,528
- I'M GOING.
- OKAY.

239
00:11:04,529 --> 00:11:06,364
both:
TIM, ARE YOU GONNA GO?

240
00:11:06,365 --> 00:11:08,299
- YEAH...

241
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:09,249
PEE-PEE.

242
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:10,468
both:
JUST GO.

243
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:11,535
- YOU--YOU GO.

244
00:11:11,536 --> 00:11:13,737
- I'M GOING.
- I'M GOING TOO.

245
00:11:31,273 --> 00:11:33,574
- [sighs]

246
00:11:35,593 --> 00:11:37,278
I'VE GOT TO GET HOME.

247
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:38,996
I'M BEHIND
ON MY SCIENCE FAIR PROJECT,

248
00:11:38,997 --> 00:11:41,615
AND I'VE GOT A BOOK REPORT
DUE TOMORROW, AND THIS--

249
00:11:41,616 --> 00:11:43,317
- WAIT. WAIT. WAIT.

250
00:11:43,318 --> 00:11:44,535
WHAT'S THE BOOK?

251
00:11:44,536 --> 00:11:46,537
- UM...

252
00:11:46,538 --> 00:11:48,256
OH, WATERSHIP DOWN.

253
00:11:48,257 --> 00:11:49,457
- AND HOW FAR DID YOU GET?

254
00:11:49,458 --> 00:11:51,375
- THERE'S A RABBIT
ON THE COVER.

255
00:11:51,376 --> 00:11:53,327
- I READ THAT BOOK LAST YEAR.

256
00:11:53,328 --> 00:11:55,129
- YEAH?

257
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,765
- YEAH,
IT'S ABOUT THESE RABBITS.

258
00:11:57,766 --> 00:11:58,832
THEY LIVE IN A HOTEL.

259
00:11:58,833 --> 00:12:00,902
- YOU MEAN IT?

260
00:12:00,903 --> 00:12:02,770
- YEAH, AND THEY'RE TWINS.

261
00:12:02,771 --> 00:12:05,039
THEIR NAMES ARE ZACK AND CODY.

262
00:12:06,308 --> 00:12:09,410
[upbeat electronic music]

263
00:12:09,411 --> 00:12:15,750
¶ ¶

264
00:12:15,751 --> 00:12:17,952
- NATALIE?

265
00:12:17,953 --> 00:12:20,788
NATALIE, ARE YOU THERE?

266
00:12:20,789 --> 00:12:22,156
NATALIE.

267
00:12:22,157 --> 00:12:23,490
- WHERE IS SHE?

268
00:12:23,491 --> 00:12:25,409
- I--I DON'T KNOW.

269
00:12:25,410 --> 00:12:27,177
- WHAT IF THAT THING GOT HER?

270
00:12:27,178 --> 00:12:28,896
- YOU DON'T EVEN KNOW
THAT THERE IS A THING.

271
00:12:28,897 --> 00:12:31,549
- WE WILL IF IT ATE NATALIE.

272
00:12:31,550 --> 00:12:35,470
- JUST STICK WITH THE PLAN
AND MEET AT THE INTERSECTION.

273
00:12:35,471 --> 00:12:39,506
- HOW ABOUT PLAN "B":
RUN, ESCAPE, LIVE?

274
00:12:39,507 --> 00:12:41,108
- INTERSECTION...NOW.

275
00:12:41,109 --> 00:12:43,044
START WALKING.

276
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:46,413

I HATE THIS.

00:12:46,414 --> 00:12:48,900
I HATE THIS.

ARTHUR, BIG PROBLEM,
BIG PROBLEM.

281
00:13:01,129 --> 00:13:04,481
ARTHUR,
MY LIGHT WENT OUT.

282
00:13:04,482 --> 00:13:09,553
OH, IT'S DARK, ARTHUR,
AND I'M BUMPING INTO WALLS,

283
00:13:09,554 --> 00:13:11,972
AND...

284
00:13:11,973 --> 00:13:14,775
OH, THERE'S STUFF
ON THESE WALLS, SLIMY STUFF.

285
00:13:16,311 --> 00:13:17,645
WHAT IF IT'S THE MONSTER?

286
00:13:17,646 --> 00:13:18,912
- IT'S COOL.

287
00:13:18,913 --> 00:13:20,714
YOU KNOW THIS PLACE
LIKE THE BACK OF YOUR HAND.

288
00:13:20,715 --> 00:13:21,815
- THAT WOULD BE FINE

289
00:13:21,816 --> 00:13:23,984
IF I COULD SEE
THE BACK OF MY HAND.

290
00:13:23,985 --> 00:13:26,620
- JUST KEEP WALKING
STRAIGHT AHEAD,

291
00:13:26,621 --> 00:13:28,939
AND EVENTUALLY,
YOU'LL SEE MY LIGHT,

292
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:31,125
AND EVERYTHING WILL BE...

293
00:13:31,126 --> 00:13:33,577
OH, NO.

294
00:13:33,578 --> 00:13:35,579
- ARTHUR, IS THAT...

295
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:37,081
- YOU HEAR IT?

296
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:38,082
- WHAT IS IT?

297
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:39,951
- RADIO SILENCE.

298
00:13:39,952 --> 00:13:41,786
- WHY WOULD WE WANT
TO DO THAT?

299
00:13:41,787 --> 00:13:43,237
- BECAUSE IT MIGHT HEAR US.

300
00:13:43,238 --> 00:13:44,805
- I'M TAKING EVASIVE ACTION.

301
00:13:44,806 --> 00:13:46,207
- NEGATIVE.
HOLD YOUR GROUND.

302
00:13:46,208 --> 00:13:47,491
THAT'S AN ORDER.

303
00:13:47,492 --> 00:13:48,843
- CONSIDER THIS A RESIGNATION

304
00:13:48,844 --> 00:13:50,795
FROM THE KNIGHTS
OF THE SQUARE TABLE.

305
00:13:50,796 --> 00:13:53,313

I KEPT CALLING.

312
00:14:18,523 --> 00:14:21,225
- I LOST MY WALKIE.

313
00:14:21,226 --> 00:14:22,476
DID YOU FIND NATALIE?

314
00:14:22,477 --> 00:14:24,561
- NOPE, NATALIE FOUND YOU.

315
00:14:24,562 --> 00:14:26,663
WHOSE TUNES?

316
00:14:26,664 --> 00:14:28,599

00:14:38,777 --> 00:14:40,610
- SHH, SHH, SHH!

321
00:14:40,611 --> 00:14:44,114

WE HAVE TO KEEP MOVING.

00:15:06,955 --> 00:15:09,240
THAT THING MIGHT BE LOOKING
FOR ITS RADIO.

332
00:15:09,241 --> 00:15:11,542
NICE.

333
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:14,929

A WEREWOLF, A VAMPIRE,

334
00:15:14,930 --> 00:15:16,730
MAYBE--MAYBE A MINOTAUR?

335
00:15:16,731 --> 00:15:18,065
- THERE'S NO SUCH THING
AS MINOTAURS.

336
00:15:18,066 --> 00:15:19,583
THEY'RE MYTHOLOGICAL.

337

ONE OF THOSE STORIES

WHERE AN ABANDONED CHILD IS
RAISED BY WOLVES OR SOMETHING.

340

341
00:15:26,457 --> 00:15:27,892
THOSE ARE NOT
HISTORICAL ACCOUNTS.

342
00:15:27,893 --> 00:15:29,727
THOSE ARE DISNEY MOVIES.

BUT I DO KNOW WHAT WE WERE:
DINNER.

00:42:56,156 --> 00:43:02,494
¶ THE DESERT COMES ALIVE
AGAINST THE HEADLIGHTS ¶

891
00:43:02,495 --> 00:43:06,465
¶ TONIGHT I WRITE
EXACTLY HOW I FEEL ¶

892
00:43:06,466 --> 00:43:08,467
¶ ¶

893
00:43:08,468 --> 00:43:10,369
- COME ON.
THIS WAY.

894
00:43:10,370 --> 00:43:13,673
- ¶ HOORAY, GOLD STAR ¶

895
00:43:13,674 --> 00:43:18,360
¶ YOU'VE COME SO FAR ¶

896
00:43:18,361 --> 00:43:21,763
¶ AND EVERYTHING YOU SEE ¶

897
00:43:21,764 --> 00:43:26,936
¶ EVERYTHING YOU SEE
IS LIKE A PHOTOGRAPH ¶

898
00:43:26,937 --> 00:43:30,022
- [snorting]

899
00:43:31,207 --> 00:43:32,374
- COULD YOU SIGN THIS,
PLEASE?

900
00:43:35,895 --> 00:43:37,496
"TO A REALLY BIG FAN."

901
00:43:39,081 --> 00:43:40,516
- HEY.

902
00:43:49,909 --> 00:43:53,646
- MR. SHANE BARKER,
THIS IS OUR TROLL.

903
00:43:53,647 --> 00:43:55,381
- NICE.

904
00:43:55,382 --> 00:43:59,418
SO, UH...WHAT,
YOU WANT ME TO SIGN HIS NOSE?

905
00:44:01,221 --> 00:44:02,938
- DARKSMOKE IS REAL.

906
00:44:02,939 --> 00:44:06,208
- YEAH, LOOK,
HARDY BOYS, NANCY DREW,

907
00:44:06,209 --> 00:44:07,709
I GET THE WHOLE
ROLE-PLAYING THING,

908
00:44:07,710 --> 00:44:09,344
BUT WE GOT A LINE
AROUND THE BLOCK,

909
00:44:09,345 --> 00:44:11,113
SO IF YOU GOT SOMETHING
FOR ME TO SIGN...

910
00:44:11,114 --> 00:44:12,147
- LOOK.

911
00:44:12,148 --> 00:44:13,482
- HUH?

912
00:44:13,483 --> 00:44:16,786
OH, YUMMY.

913
00:44:16,787 --> 00:44:17,736
- YES, THANK YOU.

914
00:44:17,737 --> 00:44:19,638
VERY NICE, CRISS ANGEL,
BUT LIKE I SAID,

915
00:44:19,639 --> 00:44:21,323
THE LINE'S 200 DEEP,

916
00:44:21,324 --> 00:44:24,176
AND I GOT TO HAND OUT
A LIFETIME ACHIEVEMENT AWARD

917
00:44:24,177 --> 00:44:26,111
TO THE OLSEN TWINS
IN 20 MINUTES.

918
00:44:26,112 --> 00:44:27,546
TRANSLATION: NEXT.

919
00:44:27,547 --> 00:44:29,230
- WAIT. LOOK.

920
00:44:29,231 --> 00:44:31,967
- [grunts]

921
00:44:34,170 --> 00:44:35,537
- HE'S--
- REGENERATING?

922
00:44:35,538 --> 00:44:37,339
- BUT THAT'S--
- IMPOSSIBLE?

923
00:44:38,658 --> 00:44:40,091
- WOW,
AND YOU FINISH MY SENTENCES.

924
00:44:40,092 --> 00:44:42,160
THIS IS WEIRD.

925
00:44:42,161 --> 00:44:43,896
OKAY, UM...

926
00:44:49,169 --> 00:44:51,203
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

927
00:44:54,191 --> 00:44:55,240
- HERE YOU GO, SWEETIE.

928
00:44:55,241 --> 00:44:56,408
THAT'S FOR YOU.

929
00:44:56,409 --> 00:44:57,676
YOU CAN KEEP THAT.

930
00:44:57,677 --> 00:44:59,444
I'LL BE BACK IN...TWO WEEKS.

931
00:44:59,445 --> 00:45:02,081
GOT TO GO.

932
00:45:02,082 --> 00:45:03,582
- WHERE ARE YOU...

933
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:05,451
- OH, MAN, HARD-CORE.

934
00:45:05,452 --> 00:45:07,352
THIS IS JUST LIKE MY DREAMS.

935
00:45:07,353 --> 00:45:09,671
- MAYBE YOU SHOULD
SEEK THERAPY.

936
00:45:09,672 --> 00:45:10,572
- I HAVE.

937
00:45:10,573 --> 00:45:12,641
IT DIDN'T WORK.
TRUST ME.

938
00:45:12,642 --> 00:45:15,244
IT ALL STARTED
BACK WHEN I WAS IN REHA--

939
00:45:16,062 --> 00:45:19,564
CAMP--CAMP REHA.

940
00:45:19,565 --> 00:45:24,453
I KEPT DREAMING ABOUT TROLLS
AND DRAGONS AND DARKSMOKE.

941
00:45:24,454 --> 00:45:26,455
I'M TALKIN' DREAMS,
VIVID DREAMS,

942
00:45:26,456 --> 00:45:28,524
LIKE--LIKE--LIKE VISIONS.

943
00:45:28,525 --> 00:45:30,693
- MAYBE YOU HAD ESP.

944
00:45:30,694 --> 00:45:32,093
- KID,
THEY DIDN'T HAVE CABLE.

945
00:45:32,094 --> 00:45:34,547
- COULDN'T YOU HAVE DREAMT
ABOUT SHEEP

946
00:45:34,548 --> 00:45:36,365
OR LOTTERY NUMBERS?

947
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:38,567
- OR LADY FRIENDS.

948
00:45:38,568 --> 00:45:39,401
- [laughs]

949
00:45:39,402 --> 00:45:40,769
DUDE, I SO WISH,

950
00:45:40,770 --> 00:45:44,639
BUT ALL I KEPT GETTING
WERE POTIONS, INGREDIENTS,

951
00:45:44,640 --> 00:45:47,843
AND...
AND A TROLL NAMED BART.

952
00:45:47,844 --> 00:45:49,661
- BART.

953
00:45:49,662 --> 00:45:50,879
- BART.
- THAT'S ME, BART.

954
00:45:50,880 --> 00:45:52,480
- THAT'S HIS NAME, ISN'T IT?
- IT'S ME.

955
00:45:52,481 --> 00:45:54,166
- [laughs]

956
00:45:54,167 --> 00:45:56,969
OW.

957
00:45:56,970 --> 00:46:00,289
I HAD THIS IMAGE OF HIM
IN A DUNGEON OR LAB,

958
00:46:00,290 --> 00:46:02,191
A LITTLE BIT OF BOTH.

959
00:46:02,192 --> 00:46:04,226
HE WAS DARKSMOKE'S PRISONER.

960
00:46:04,227 --> 00:46:05,511
- DARKSMOKE...
[grumbles]

961
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:08,847
- I WAS RIGHT.
THAT EXPLAINS THE CHAIN.

962
00:46:08,848 --> 00:46:11,901
- DARKSMOKE HAD HIM WORKING
ON CONTROL POTIONS...

963
00:46:11,902 --> 00:46:15,020
AND SOMETHING BIGGER.

964
00:46:15,021 --> 00:46:16,638
- YOU NEED TO SEE SOMETHING.

965
00:46:28,702 --> 00:46:31,120
- DRIPPY THING,

966
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,372
MYSTIC VAPOR,

967
00:46:33,373 --> 00:46:37,843
REGENERATION POTION.

968
00:46:37,844 --> 00:46:40,011
IT'S CALLED "PERSONAL SPACE."

969
00:46:41,464 --> 00:46:43,215
IT'S A REVERSAL POTION.

970
00:46:43,216 --> 00:46:46,301
- THERE'S NO REVERSAL POTION
IN ELIXIR QUEST.

971
00:46:46,302 --> 00:46:48,270
- EYES ONLY, KID.

972
00:46:48,271 --> 00:46:50,772
ASH...

973
00:46:50,773 --> 00:46:53,375
LIMESTONE...

974
00:46:53,376 --> 00:46:56,311
MUD PEPPER.

975
00:46:56,312 --> 00:46:57,979
IT'S TRANSFIGURATION.

976
00:46:57,980 --> 00:47:01,083
- IF TRANSFIGURATION POTIONS
ARE STILL AROUND...

977
00:47:01,084 --> 00:47:02,768
- THEN DARKSMOKE
IS STILL AROUND.

978
00:47:02,769 --> 00:47:04,787
- BUT HE DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
A DRAGON ANYMORE.

979
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:07,206
- WHICH MEANS DARKSMOKE
CAN BE ANYWHERE.

980
00:47:07,207 --> 00:47:08,624
- THAT'S RIGHT...

981
00:47:08,625 --> 00:47:10,409
OR ANYONE.

982
00:47:10,410 --> 00:47:13,946
OH, MOM WAS RIGHT.

983
00:47:13,947 --> 00:47:16,081
I SHOULD HAVE FINISHED
COMMUNITY COLLEGE.

984
00:47:16,082 --> 00:47:17,416
- WHAT DO WE DO?

985
00:47:17,417 --> 00:47:18,550
- I DON'T KNOW.

986
00:47:18,551 --> 00:47:19,968
SEND HIM BACK
TO THE MOTHER SHIP.

987
00:47:19,969 --> 00:47:21,420
SELL HIM TO A FREAK SHOW.

988
00:47:21,421 --> 00:47:22,805
- BART'S ONE OF THE GOOD GUYS.

989
00:47:22,806 --> 00:47:23,972
- HOW DO YOU KNOW?

990
00:47:23,973 --> 00:47:25,674
FOR ALL YOU KNOW,
HE COULD BE DARKSMOKE.

991
00:47:27,193 --> 00:47:29,160
YOU'D BETTER GET
A PROPANE TORCH.

992
00:47:29,161 --> 00:47:30,545
- BECAUSE...

993
00:47:30,546 --> 00:47:33,549
- BECAUSE FIRE IS THE ONLY WAY
TO FINISH OFF A REGENERATOR.

994
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,851
- NOBODY IS GONNA
CHARBROIL BART.

995
00:47:35,852 --> 00:47:37,736
- I'VE GOT A SERIOUS MIGRAINE.

996
00:47:37,737 --> 00:47:40,739
MM-NGAH, MM-NGAH, MM.

997
00:47:40,740 --> 00:47:42,191
NNH-NNH, NNH, MAMA.

998
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:44,459
- BART ESCAPED FROM DARKSMOKE.

999
00:47:44,460 --> 00:47:47,345
- YEAH, BART'S ONE OF US.

1000
00:47:50,099 --> 00:47:52,801
- BART'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE,
AND IF YOU TATTLE--

1001
00:47:52,802 --> 00:47:54,085
- TATTLE?
REALLY?

1002
00:47:54,086 --> 00:47:55,454
[laughs]

1003
00:47:55,455 --> 00:47:58,923
SHANE, OLD BOY, YOU HAVE GOT
TO GET A NEW AGENT.

1004
00:47:58,924 --> 00:48:01,977
HEY, HEY, HEY,
TAKE IT EASY, JACKIE CHAN, HUH?

1005
00:48:05,398 --> 00:48:06,965
- ASPIRIN?
- [laughs]

1006
00:48:06,966 --> 00:48:08,567
I KNEW I LIKED YOU, KID.

1007
00:48:08,568 --> 00:48:10,302
I JUST DIDN'T KNOW WHY.

1008
00:48:12,538 --> 00:48:15,490
LOOK, GUYS, I REALLY THINK,
FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY,

1009
00:48:15,491 --> 00:48:19,044
WE'VE GOT TO GET
SOME SERIOUS HELP.

1010
00:48:31,424 --> 00:48:32,891
OH, YOU LITTLE TWIT.

1011
00:48:32,892 --> 00:48:34,058
- RED POTION.

1012
00:48:34,059 --> 00:48:35,360
RING ANY BELLS?

1013
00:48:35,361 --> 00:48:37,780
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT:
CONTROL.

1014
00:48:37,781 --> 00:48:40,398
YOU'RE GONNA DO
WHATEVER WE SAY.

1015
00:48:40,399 --> 00:48:42,233
HALT.

1016
00:48:42,234 --> 00:48:44,019
- NO.

1017
00:48:44,020 --> 00:48:45,320
- SIT.

1018
00:48:45,321 --> 00:48:46,688
ROLL OVER.

1019
00:48:46,689 --> 00:48:47,756
PLAY DEAD.

1020
00:48:47,757 --> 00:48:49,925
- YEAH?
I'LL SHOW YOU "PLAY DEAD."

1021
00:48:49,926 --> 00:48:52,094
- TIM, THAT POTION WASN'T RED.
IT'S PINK.

1022
00:48:52,095 --> 00:48:54,396
- COME HERE,
YOU LITTLE SNOT-NOSED,

1023
00:48:54,397 --> 00:48:56,598
BED-WETTING,
UNDERWEAR-SKIDDING BRAT.

1024
00:48:56,599 --> 00:48:57,849
[knock at door]

1025
00:48:57,850 --> 00:48:59,234
- UH-OH.

1026
00:48:59,235 --> 00:49:00,986
- WHAT IS ALL
THE COMMOTION ABOUT?

1027
00:49:00,987 --> 00:49:02,988
DID SOMEBODY...

1028
00:49:02,989 --> 00:49:06,090
- ¶ OH,
CAN I GET YOUR NUMBER, BABY ¶

1029
00:49:06,091 --> 00:49:08,827
¶ SO I CAN CALL YOU SOMETIME ¶

1030
00:49:08,828 --> 00:49:11,263
¶ CAN I GET YOUR NUMBER, BABY ¶

1031
00:49:11,264 --> 00:49:13,932
¶ SO I CAN CALL YOU TONIGHT ¶

1032
00:49:13,933 --> 00:49:16,702
¶ CAN I GET YOUR NUMBER, BABY ¶

1033
00:49:16,703 --> 00:49:18,037
¶ SO I CAN CALL YOU SOME-- ¶

1034
00:49:18,038 --> 00:49:19,304
[record scratches]

1035
00:49:19,305 --> 00:49:22,424
- ARTHUR, WHO IS THIS GUY
IN THE LEATHER PANTS?

1036
00:49:22,425 --> 00:49:25,094
- HE IS MY...
SCIENCE TEACHER.

1037
00:49:25,095 --> 00:49:27,145
- REALLY?

1038
00:49:27,146 --> 00:49:28,980
YOU DON'T STRIKE ME
AS SCIENCE-Y.

1039
00:49:28,981 --> 00:49:31,399
- WHAT DO I STRIKE YOU AS,

1040
00:49:31,400 --> 00:49:34,319
MY LITTLE CHRYSANTHEMUM?

1041
00:49:35,638 --> 00:49:37,756
- WE'RE WORKING
ON MY SCIENCE FAIR PROJECT.

1042
00:49:37,757 --> 00:49:42,143
- AH, AND SO HE'S THE, UH,
SCIENCE FAIRY?

1043
00:49:42,144 --> 00:49:43,795
- HE'S MISTER...

1044
00:49:43,796 --> 00:49:44,530
- BAGGINS.

1045
00:49:44,531 --> 00:49:46,114
- BAGGINS, AH.

1046
00:49:46,115 --> 00:49:49,484
WELL, UH,
HELLO, MR. BAGGINS.

1047
00:49:49,485 --> 00:49:52,154
AND SO WHAT IS MY ARTHUR DOING
FOR THE SCIENCE FAIR?

1048
00:49:52,155 --> 00:49:53,655
- OH,
IT BEATS THE HECK OUT OF--

1049
00:49:53,656 --> 00:49:55,657
- IT'S COMPLICATED.

1050
00:49:55,658 --> 00:49:57,409
- OH.

1051
00:49:57,410 --> 00:49:58,877
HMM, LOOKS COMPLICATED.

1052
00:49:58,878 --> 00:50:00,312
- BEER.

1053
00:50:00,313 --> 00:50:01,897
- BEER?

1054
00:50:01,898 --> 00:50:05,968
- UH, HE'S...
BREWING BEER.

1055
00:50:05,969 --> 00:50:07,853
- IS BEER REALLY
AN APPROPRIATE PROJECT

1056
00:50:07,854 --> 00:50:09,371
FOR A SEVENTH GRADE
SCIENCE FAIR?

1057
00:50:09,372 --> 00:50:11,607
- NOT AS ACCEPTABLE AS WINE.

1058
00:50:11,608 --> 00:50:13,442
- WINE?

1059
00:50:13,443 --> 00:50:16,578
- WINE, SOME CANDLELIGHT...

1060
00:50:16,579 --> 00:50:19,147
I MEAN, OVER DINNER.

1061
00:50:22,869 --> 00:50:24,319
- [laughs]

1062
00:50:24,320 --> 00:50:28,173
UM...

1063
00:50:28,174 --> 00:50:29,141
EXCUSE ME.

1064
00:50:32,762 --> 00:50:34,296
- [laughs]

1065
00:50:34,297 --> 00:50:35,864
[sighs]

1066
00:50:35,865 --> 00:50:38,099
- HAVE HER BACK BY 12:00.

1067
00:50:42,888 --> 00:50:44,890
WE NEED TO GO
THROUGH HIS STUFF.

1068
00:50:44,891 --> 00:50:46,658
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING
THAT WILL CLUE US IN

1069
00:50:46,659 --> 00:50:48,193
TO WHO DARKSMOKE REALLY IS.

1070
00:50:48,194 --> 00:50:51,497
- LIKE A CHRISTMAS CARD
FROM DARKSMOKE?

1071
00:50:51,498 --> 00:50:53,415
- NO, NO.
I SAID NO TOUCHING.

1072
00:50:53,416 --> 00:50:55,968
NO, IT'S BAD.

1073
00:50:55,969 --> 00:50:59,504
- TIM, TAKE BART DOWNSTAIRS
AND...

1074
00:50:59,505 --> 00:51:01,390
TEACH HIM HOW TO USE
THE MICROWAVE.

1075
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:02,724
- THE MICROWAVE?

1076
00:51:02,725 --> 00:51:04,826
- TIM, JUST DO IT.

1077
00:51:04,827 --> 00:51:07,829
- MICROWAVE 101
COMING RIGHT UP.

1078
00:51:07,830 --> 00:51:10,165
- BART, GO WITH TIM.

1079
00:51:10,166 --> 00:51:13,251
- [grumbling]

1080
00:51:15,104 --> 00:51:20,409
TOUCH, NO.
BAD. NO.

1081
00:51:23,596 --> 00:51:25,630
- I HAVEN'T BEEN DATING,
ALTHOUGH SOME PEOPLE,

1082
00:51:25,631 --> 00:51:26,848
YOU KNOW, HAVE ASKED ME.

1083
00:51:26,849 --> 00:51:28,584
I JUST THINK
IT WOULD BE WEIRD FOR ARTHUR.

1084
00:51:28,585 --> 00:51:31,169
I MEAN, THINK ABOUT IT:

1085
00:51:31,170 --> 00:51:32,871
YOUR MOTHER ON A DATE,

1086
00:51:32,872 --> 00:51:37,742
MAKING OUT
IN THE BACK OF A MOVIE THEATER.

1087
00:51:37,743 --> 00:51:39,544
I'M NOT IMPLYING
THAT THIS IS A DATE

1088
00:51:39,545 --> 00:51:43,748
OR THAT ANY MAKING OF ANYTHING
WILL BE INVOLVED.

1089
00:51:43,749 --> 00:51:48,987
THIS IS PURELY A RATED "T"
FOR "TEEN" DATE, RIGHT?

1090
00:51:48,988 --> 00:51:52,173
[laughs]
HOW MANY TIMES DID I SAY "DATE"?

1091
00:51:52,174 --> 00:51:53,458
WOW.

1092
00:51:53,459 --> 00:51:55,009
YOU SMELL SOMETHING?

1093
00:51:55,010 --> 00:51:57,011
- OH, IT'S MY COLOGNE.

1094
00:51:57,012 --> 00:51:59,214
I CALL IT "BARBARIAN."

1095
00:51:59,999 --> 00:52:01,200
- NO, I DON'T THINK SO.

1096
00:52:01,201 --> 00:52:02,450
- OH.

1097
00:52:02,451 --> 00:52:05,387
- EW, ZUT ALORS.

1098
00:52:05,388 --> 00:52:07,054
YUCK.

1099
00:52:07,055 --> 00:52:08,690
- SO TELL ME ABOUT--

1100
00:52:08,691 --> 00:52:10,075
- HEY, HEY, HEY.

1101
00:52:10,076 --> 00:52:11,843
KEEP 'EM
WHERE I CAN SEE 'EM HUH?

1102
00:52:11,844 --> 00:52:12,978
- I'M SORRY.

1103
00:52:12,979 --> 00:52:14,746
IT'S JUST...
I LOVE YOU.

1104
00:52:31,580 --> 00:52:33,114
- "BUTT."

1105
00:52:33,115 --> 00:52:36,117
B-U-T-T.

1106
00:52:36,118 --> 00:52:37,819
BUTT.

1107
00:52:37,820 --> 00:52:38,987
- BART.

1108
00:52:38,988 --> 00:52:40,889
- NO, NO, NO, NOT BART.
- BART.

1109
00:52:40,890 --> 00:52:43,424
- NO, NOT BART.

1110
00:52:43,425 --> 00:52:46,995
BUUUU-UTT.

1111
00:52:46,996 --> 00:52:49,230
BUUUU-UTT.

1112
00:52:49,231 --> 00:52:50,181
- BUTT.

1113
00:52:50,182 --> 00:52:51,917
- YES, BUTT.
- BUTT.

1114
00:52:51,918 --> 00:52:53,418
- BUTT.
- BUTT.

1115
00:52:53,419 --> 00:52:58,340
- AND OUT OF YOUR BUTT
COMES A FART.

1116
00:52:58,341 --> 00:53:00,442
- FAA-ART.

1117
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:02,277
- FART.
- FART, BUTT.

1118
00:53:02,278 --> 00:53:04,395
- BUTT, FART.

1119
00:53:04,396 --> 00:53:05,664
- FART.
- FART.

1120
00:53:05,665 --> 00:53:08,600
- FART
- AND BURP.

1121
00:53:08,601 --> 00:53:12,020
BURP IS OUT OF YOUR MOUTH,

1122
00:53:12,021 --> 00:53:13,755
LIKE IF YOU HAD A BIG--

1123
00:53:13,756 --> 00:53:14,890
- [burps]
- BURP.

1124
00:53:14,891 --> 00:53:16,124
- BURP.

1125
00:53:16,125 --> 00:53:18,259
- IF YOU HAD A BIG SODA,
THEN YOU GOT TO BURP.

1126
00:53:18,260 --> 00:53:21,379
[people chattering]

1127
00:53:29,522 --> 00:53:31,606
- LOOK, MOMMY.
LOOK AT ME.

1128
00:53:33,409 --> 00:53:34,542
- CHECK THIS OUT.

1129
00:53:39,415 --> 00:53:42,517
- MMM.

1130
00:53:42,518 --> 00:53:46,471
- WOW, THAT'S SOME PIZZA.

1131
00:53:46,472 --> 00:53:48,757
- HERE YOU GO, KID.
BUY YOURSELF SOME FRESCA.

1132
00:53:51,144 --> 00:53:54,512
OH, THIS PLACE IS SO ROMANTIC,
ISN'T IT?

1133
00:53:54,513 --> 00:53:56,764
- I KNOW. I KNOW.

1134
00:53:56,765 --> 00:54:01,069
- CUSTOM-MADE PIZZA
AND A DELICIOUS DIET SPRITE.

1135
00:54:01,070 --> 00:54:02,970
- YEAH.

1136
00:54:06,275 --> 00:54:08,242
UM, YOU KNOW WHAT?

1137
00:54:08,243 --> 00:54:09,644
I GOT TO MAKE A PHONE CALL,

1138
00:54:09,645 --> 00:54:11,363
SO JUST FLIRT
AMONGST YOURSELVES, OKAY?

1139
00:54:11,364 --> 00:54:12,764
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

1140
00:54:12,765 --> 00:54:14,866
- OKAY.

1141
00:54:14,867 --> 00:54:15,984
[sighs]

1142
00:54:17,487 --> 00:54:22,524
- NEO...ALITHI...UMINUM.

1143
00:54:22,525 --> 00:54:25,193
- YOU THINK BART'S
THE NEW CHEMISTRY TEACHER?

1144
00:54:26,729 --> 00:54:29,230
- OH, YEAH,
NEW HIGH SCORE.

1145
00:54:35,871 --> 00:54:36,938
- OOH.

1146
00:54:46,398 --> 00:54:48,466
OH. OH.

1147
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:00,061
OH, THIS STUFF IS GOOD.

1148
00:55:09,522 --> 00:55:11,222
- IT'S WORKING.

1149
00:55:11,223 --> 00:55:14,309
- I GUESS HE'S NEVER SEEN E.T.

1150
00:55:17,079 --> 00:55:18,447
HELLO.

1151
00:55:18,448 --> 00:55:19,581
GET HIM.

1152
00:55:30,359 --> 00:55:33,027
- OKAY, OKAY,
HEY, HEY, HEY.

1153
00:55:33,028 --> 00:55:35,029
YOU WANT TO GO
SOMEWHERE ELSE?

1154
00:55:35,030 --> 00:55:38,032
- YES, HOME, ALONE.

1155
00:55:41,387 --> 00:55:45,306
MM,
OR COFFEE WITH YOU.

1156
00:55:48,594 --> 00:55:50,445
- [groans]

1157
00:55:50,446 --> 00:55:52,497
- MAYBE HE HAS A GIRLFRIEND.

1158
00:55:52,498 --> 00:55:56,701
OR MAYBE HE WENT
TO VEGAS, BABY.

1159
00:55:56,702 --> 00:56:00,838
OR MAYBE HE WENT
TO IRELAND OR--

1160
00:56:00,839 --> 00:56:03,275
- TIM, TIM,
HE WOULDN'T JUST DO THAT.

1161
00:56:03,276 --> 00:56:04,676
HE'S AN ALCHEMIST.

1162
00:56:04,677 --> 00:56:06,460
HE JUST WON'T LEAVE
ALL HIS STUFF,

1163
00:56:06,461 --> 00:56:08,380
HIS MAGIC POTIONS
AND HIS BEAKERS,

1164
00:56:08,381 --> 00:56:10,315
EVERYWHERE IN MY ROOM.

1165
00:56:12,851 --> 00:56:16,488
- YOU WANT TO GO
LOOK FOR HIM?

1166
00:56:16,489 --> 00:56:18,623
- NO.

1167
00:56:18,624 --> 00:56:21,659
WE DON'T HAVE TO.

1168
00:56:21,660 --> 00:56:23,328
WE HAVE DIVINATION POTION.

1169
00:56:35,441 --> 00:56:37,109
- WHAT'D YOU SEE?

1170
00:56:37,110 --> 00:56:40,145
- NOTHING.
IT MUST BE A DUD.

1171
00:56:56,862 --> 00:56:59,247
I KNOW WHERE HE IS.
WE HAVE TO HURRY.

1172
00:56:59,248 --> 00:57:01,382
- OKAY, BUT BEFORE WE SAVE
THE WORLD AND STUFF,

1173
00:57:01,383 --> 00:57:03,051
I BETTER CALL MY PARENTS.

1174
00:57:03,052 --> 00:57:05,253
[beeping]

1175
00:57:05,254 --> 00:57:07,455
[dog barking]

1176
00:57:11,177 --> 00:57:13,762
- MAYBE IT FELL
OFF THE CIRCUS TRUCK.

1177
00:57:13,763 --> 00:57:15,347
- MAYBE IT FELL
OFF THE UGLY TRUCK.

1178
00:57:15,348 --> 00:57:17,149
- WE GONNA STICK FIRECRACKERS
IN HIS MOUTH?

1179
00:57:17,150 --> 00:57:18,316
- SHUT UP, MUNCH.

1180
00:57:18,317 --> 00:57:20,519
- WHAT ABOUT WATER BALLOONS?
- SHUT UP.

1181
00:57:20,520 --> 00:57:22,053
- OR MAYBE WE CAN PUT GRENDEL
IN THE CAGE

1182
00:57:22,054 --> 00:57:23,355
AND WATCH THEM FIGHT.

1183
00:57:23,356 --> 00:57:25,807
- I SAID SHUT UP.

1184
00:57:25,808 --> 00:57:27,809
THIS RIGHT HERE
IS MY FIRST-PLACE RIBBON

1185
00:57:27,810 --> 00:57:29,244
FOR THE SCIENCE FAIR TOMORROW.

1186
00:57:31,180 --> 00:57:33,865
HEY, TROLL.

1187
00:57:33,866 --> 00:57:35,516

00:57:37,170 --> 00:57:38,253
[sneezes]

1189
00:57:38,254 --> 00:57:40,572
- AH! ALIEN SLIME.
ALIEN SLIME.

1190
00:57:40,573 --> 00:57:42,723
[screaming]

1191
00:58:03,995 --> 00:58:06,698
- HEY--HEY,
WHAT IF METZ IS DARKSMOKE?

1192
00:58:06,699 --> 00:58:08,866
HE'S DARK,
AND HE SMOKES AND--

1193
00:58:08,867 --> 00:58:11,969
- HEY, HEY,
WE HAVE THE POTIONS.

1194
00:58:11,970 --> 00:58:14,071
IT'S JUST LIKE IN ELIXIR QUEST.

1195
00:58:14,072 --> 00:58:15,707
WE CAN FIGHT HIM
WITH THE POTIONS.

1196
00:58:15,708 --> 00:58:18,410
- [gasp]
- [exhales forcefully]

1197
00:58:18,411 --> 00:58:21,079
- OKAY, OKAY, WHY ARE WE--
WHY ARE WE AT THE SCHOOL?

1198
00:58:21,080 --> 00:58:23,347
THIS IS DEFINITELY THE WORST
DATE I'VE EVER BEEN ON.

1199
00:58:23,348 --> 00:58:24,615
- DON'T YOU HAVE A CELL PHONE?

1200
00:58:24,616 --> 00:58:26,617
- YEAH, YEAH,
IT'S IN MY POCKET OVER HERE.

1201
00:58:26,618 --> 00:58:27,919
- WELL,
LET ME TRY TO REACH IT.

1202
00:58:27,920 --> 00:58:29,987
- HEY, HEY, HEY, HEY,
JUST THE PHONE.

1203
00:58:29,988 --> 00:58:32,390
- OKAY, ALL RIGHT.
TAKE IT EASY. I'M SORRY.

1204
00:58:32,391 --> 00:58:33,591
LOOK,
I'M SORRY ABOUT BEFORE.

1205
00:58:33,592 --> 00:58:36,527
I--I WASN'T FEELING MYSELF.

1206
00:58:36,528 --> 00:58:38,363
YOU KNOW,
YOU'RE REALLY NOT MY TYPE.

1207
00:58:38,364 --> 00:58:39,663
- OH, I'M NOT YOUR TYPE, HUH?

1208
00:58:39,664 --> 00:58:41,665
YEAH, WELL,
YOU COULD HAVE FOOLED ME.

1209
00:58:41,666 --> 00:58:43,318
- NO, NO, NO.
THAT'S NOT WHAT I MEANT.

1210
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:45,687
YOU'RE FINE.
YOU'RE JUST--

1211
00:58:45,688 --> 00:58:47,022
- I'M JUST WHAT?

1212
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,823
- TOO...MOM-ISH.

1213
00:58:48,824 --> 00:58:50,525
- AMISH?
- MOM-ISH.

1214
00:58:50,526 --> 00:58:53,077
- MO--OH, MOM-ISH,
TOO MOM-ISH.

1215
00:58:53,078 --> 00:58:54,679
NICE, NICE.

1216
00:58:54,680 --> 00:58:56,147
- IT'S JUST AN OBSERVATION.

1217
00:58:56,148 --> 00:58:58,299
- WELL, THANK YOU,
CAPTAIN OBVIOUS.

1218
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:59,601
I AM A MOM.

1219
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:01,836
I DON'T HAVE TIME
TO WALK AROUND IN LEATHER PANTS

1220
00:59:01,837 --> 00:59:02,770
READING COMIC BOOKS.

1221
00:59:02,771 --> 00:59:05,039
I HAVE BILLS TO PAY
AND MEALS TO MAKE

1222
00:59:05,040 --> 00:59:06,474
AND A LITTLE BOY
TO CIVILIZE.

1223
00:59:06,475 --> 00:59:09,727
- ENOUGH, ENOUGH. I...

1224
00:59:09,728 --> 00:59:11,429
YOU'RE A GOOD MOM.

1225
00:59:11,430 --> 00:59:13,364
- LOOK, WHAT ARE YOU ANYWAY?
WHO ARE YOU?

1226
00:59:13,365 --> 00:59:15,299
YOU ARE DEFINITELY NOT
A SCIENCE TEACHER.

1227
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,902
- [chuckles]
THANK YOU, MAMA OBVIOUS.

1228
00:59:17,903 --> 00:59:21,439
- YEAH, WELL...
ARE YOU A SERIAL KILLER?

1229
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:23,774
- I DIDN'T HAVE
THE S.A.T. SCORES.

1230
00:59:23,775 --> 00:59:25,126
- OH, I HAD TO ASK.

1231
00:59:25,127 --> 00:59:26,761
- LOOK, I'M A GAME DESIGNER,
OKAY?

1232
00:59:26,762 --> 00:59:28,563
I'M HUGE IN FINLAND.

1233
00:59:28,564 --> 00:59:31,099
I DESIGNED THE GAME
ELIXIR QUEST.

1234
00:59:31,100 --> 00:59:33,150
ANYWAY, IT'S THIS GAME
BASED ON TROLLS AND DRAGONS

1235
00:59:33,151 --> 00:59:35,953
THAT ACTUALLY LIVE
IN OUR WORLD.

1236
00:59:35,954 --> 00:59:38,873
YOUR SON DISCOVERED A TROLL
THAT MAY HOLD THE KEY

1237
00:59:38,874 --> 00:59:42,377
TO RESTORING
THE MOST VILE DRAGON OF THEM ALL

1238
00:59:42,378 --> 00:59:44,745
TO HIS PREVIOUS REIGN OF EVIL.

1239
00:59:44,746 --> 00:59:47,015
- SO YOU'RE NOT
A SERIAL KILLER.

1240
00:59:47,016 --> 00:59:49,334
YOU'RE JUST CRAZY.

1241
00:59:49,335 --> 00:59:52,870
- OKAY, LOOK, HOW ABOUT I TRY
FOR THAT PHONE ONE MORE TIME?

1245
00:59:57,276 --> 01:00:00,261
- YOU'D BE FREAKING TOO IF YOU
JUST GOT SPLATTERED IN THE FACE.

1246
01:00:00,262 --> 01:00:01,996
IT MIGHT BE RADIOACTIVE
OR SOMETHING.

1247
01:00:01,997 --> 01:00:04,449
- METZ, WE ONLY HAVE A FEW HOURS
BEFORE THE SCIENCE FAIR.

1248
01:00:04,450 --> 01:00:07,235
- THEN WE BEST START
THE DISSECTION.

[gasps]

1253
01:00:17,396 --> 01:00:21,533

01:00:21,534 --> 01:00:23,868
OH, MRS. LYLE,

WHO IS YOUR
GENTLEMAN FRIEND, HMM?

1256
01:00:27,172 --> 01:00:29,708
HE'S QUITE A CATCH.

1257
01:00:29,709 --> 01:00:32,227
YOU DON'T REMEMBER ME,
DO YOU?

1258
01:00:32,228 --> 01:00:34,379
- OH, WOW,

I WAS A TEACHER.

1263
01:00:40,953 --> 01:00:44,122

WHO SAW SOMETHING

1265
01:00:46,425 --> 01:00:49,460
HE SHOULDN'T HAVE SEEN.

1266
01:00:49,461 --> 01:00:51,563
- THIS GIG IS SO TEMPORARY.

1267
01:00:51,564 --> 01:00:55,399
I'M AN ARTIST.

1268
01:00:55,400 --> 01:00:58,703
OF COURSE I REMEMBERED
YOUR BIRTHDAY.

1269
01:00:58,704 --> 01:01:01,606
YES,
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE IT.

1270
01:01:01,607 --> 01:01:04,743

1272
01:01:06,662 --> 01:01:10,381
IT'S THE MOST ROMANTIC THING

1273
01:01:10,382 --> 01:01:12,483
YES...

1274
01:01:12,484 --> 01:01:15,136
[door creaking]

1275
01:01:18,823 --> 01:01:22,493

AND THE WORLD WILL ONCE AGAIN
KNOW THE NAME LORD DARKSMOKE.

1278

NO.

1289
01:02:40,488 --> 01:02:41,806
GET.

1290
01:02:41,807 --> 01:02:43,975
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN HERE?

1291
01:02:43,976 --> 01:02:45,526
- UH, SWEEPING.

1292
01:02:45,527 --> 01:02:46,644
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

1293
01:02:46,645 --> 01:02:47,778
- WHAT'S IN YOUR HAND?

1294
01:02:47,779 --> 01:02:49,814

NO.

1297
01:02:57,339 --> 01:03:01,609
YOU ATE THE LIST OF INGREDIENTS
TO THE REVERSAL POTION

1298
01:03:01,610 --> 01:03:06,214
WHICH WILL RETURN LORD DARKSMOKE
TO HIS FULL FORM.

1299
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:08,583
WE HAVE GATHERED
ALL THE INGREDIENTS EXCEPT ONE.

1300
01:03:08,584 --> 01:03:10,418
- WHY DON'T I REMEMBER THAT?

1301
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:12,052
- BECAUSE YOU WENT
TO THE PO-PO.

1302
01:03:16,024 --> 01:03:17,191

1303
01:03:19,427 --> 01:03:22,830

01:03:28,304 --> 01:03:31,939
WE SLIPPED IT INTO YOUR SANKA
AT THE JAIL.

1308
01:03:43,369 --> 01:03:45,119

- I SHOULD SHOWER.

1312
01:03:50,409 --> 01:03:52,210
- THIS EXTENSION PACK
IS SUPPOSED TO HAVE

1313
01:03:52,211 --> 01:03:54,895
A REVERSAL POTION CARD
WITH A LIST OF INGREDIENTS

1314
01:03:54,896 --> 01:03:58,466
WHICH HAS BEEN BURIED
IN OUR SUBCONSCIOUS.

1315
01:03:58,467 --> 01:04:00,985

IF YOU HAVE WHAT YOU NEED,

1316
01:04:00,986 --> 01:04:02,670
WHY DON'T YOU JUST LET US GO?

1317
01:04:02,671 --> 01:04:06,007
- 'CAUSE THAT CARD

1331
01:04:34,420 --> 01:04:35,837
- I DIDN'T OPEN
THE BLACK ONE.

1332
01:04:35,838 --> 01:04:37,855
- YOU DON'T JUST MIX KOOL-AID
WITH POTIONS.

1333
01:04:37,856 --> 01:04:40,491
THAT'S HOW YOU TELL, LIKE,

- IT TOUCHED ME.

1341
01:04:56,692 --> 01:04:59,277

NO DOGS, PIGS, FROGS, SNAKES...
IF THEY'RE ALIVE.

1343
01:05:03,331 --> 01:05:05,400
BUT IF THEY'RE DEAD...

- WOW, METZ, YOU'RE A FREAK.

1355
01:05:32,344 --> 01:05:34,528
I SHOULD HAVE LISTENED

1356
01:05:34,529 --> 01:05:38,833
- I WONDER WHAT QUEEN ARTHUR'S
GONNA LOOK LIKE WITH A BUZZ CUT.

1357

SOMEWHERE IN THERE
WAS THE DRAGON'S LAIR.

BE CAREFUL.
