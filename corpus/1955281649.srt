Gentlemen,

5
00:00:45,146 --> 00:00:48,547
all the evidence in this case
indicates to me

6
00:00:48,549 --> 00:00:50,182
that your true motive

7
00:00:50,184 --> 00:00:54,019
was the most common
of all motives for crime,

8
00:00:54,021 --> 00:00:55,687
and that is greed.

9
00:00:55,689 --> 00:01:00,526
And despite all of the media
and public attention

10
00:01:00,528 --> 00:01:02,995
that this trial has received,

11
00:01:02,997 --> 00:01:05,397
today, here in my courtroom,

12
00:01:05,399 --> 00:01:09,134
you are nothing more than
a bunch of common criminals.

13
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:13,906
And for that reason,
I intend to make it

14
00:01:13,908 --> 00:01:16,742
very clear here today

15
00:01:16,744 --> 00:01:19,745
that even rising star athletes

00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:42,007
do you know why we, um,

182
00:10:42,009 --> 00:10:45,043
study game film?

183
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:50,415
To find our mistakes.

184
00:10:51,485 --> 00:10:53,918
See what we do well

185
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:55,920
and where we need

186
00:10:55,922 --> 00:10:59,491
improvement.

187
00:10:59,493 --> 00:11:01,493
Or...

188
00:11:01,495 --> 00:11:03,828
to find the tendencies

189
00:11:03,830 --> 00:11:06,931
of our opponent,

190
00:11:06,933 --> 00:11:08,867
good or bad.

191
00:11:11,204 --> 00:11:13,038
You...

192
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,807
don't have the, uh,

193
00:11:15,809 --> 00:11:19,511
luxury to rewind your life.

194
00:11:21,114 --> 00:11:23,381
So make good choices

195
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:25,450
the first time.

196
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:33,124
Any word back
on that summer incident?

197
00:11:33,126 --> 00:11:35,927
Not yet.

198
00:11:38,799 --> 00:11:41,466
(film starts playing)

199
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:44,569
(school bell rings)

200
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:47,305
(indistinct conversations)

201
00:11:47,307 --> 00:11:48,673
But you did do the homework?

202
00:11:48,675 --> 00:11:50,709
Yes, sir.

203
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:52,377
And you didn't get
a grade for it?

204
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:55,346
As for now, I got a zero.

205
00:11:55,348 --> 00:11:58,817
Mr. Russeau,
I think it would be best

206
00:11:58,819 --> 00:12:01,820
if we have Gary taken out
of Mr. Bates' class

207
00:12:01,822 --> 00:12:05,023
before it's too late.

208
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:06,758
Well, now, we got a policy

209
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,894
about letting students
transfer out of classes.

210
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,030
Especially this late
in the six weeks.

211
00:12:12,032 --> 00:12:14,599
I definitely understand,
but I'm asking you, please,

212
00:12:14,601 --> 00:12:16,101
to make an exception

213
00:12:16,103 --> 00:12:19,537
under the circumstances.

214
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:22,006
Please.

00:12:23,744 --> 00:12:25,276
where your money at, homeboy?

217
00:12:25,278 --> 00:12:26,845
I got something
better than that.

218
00:12:26,847 --> 00:12:28,446
What the hell is that?

219
00:12:28,448 --> 00:12:30,215

- Come on, dawg.

00:12:48,969 --> 00:12:51,770
Are you gonna shoot the dice
or blow the damn dice?

226

- Shit. -Same... same stuff,
every time. -(hisses)

Nine, my point.
We...

234
00:13:09,089 --> 00:13:12,323
Nine. I see that.
I like nine.

all go home early.

355
00:18:43,223 --> 00:18:44,822
PLAYER:
What? Early?

356
00:18:44,824 --> 00:18:46,624
VONNER: Listen, when you guys
go home tonight,

357
00:18:46,626 --> 00:18:48,092
make sure you get some rest.

358
00:18:48,094 --> 00:18:49,760
All right, quit chasing
them girls all night.

359
00:18:49,762 --> 00:18:51,929
There's gonna be plenty of time
for that in college.

360
00:18:51,931 --> 00:18:54,332
All right? Let's go.

361
00:18:56,336 --> 00:18:59,637
(crickets chirping, dog barking)

362
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:03,374
(sighs)

363
00:19:13,419 --> 00:19:15,820
You okay?

364
00:19:17,957 --> 00:19:22,493
I think... I'm losing them.

365
00:19:22,495 --> 00:19:26,430
(scoffs, sighs)

366
00:19:26,432 --> 00:19:29,000
You know, all these years,

367
00:19:29,002 --> 00:19:33,104
I've never seen you take a game
so serious.

368
00:19:33,106 --> 00:19:34,772
It was only a tie, Freddie.

369
00:19:34,774 --> 00:19:37,141
Jessie's parents...

370
00:19:37,143 --> 00:19:41,612
They said he got probation
for stealing that T-shirt.

371
00:19:41,614 --> 00:19:44,182
What?

372
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:46,517
Football should...

373
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:50,321
Football is supposed
to build character.

374
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:53,457
It's got to prepare these boys
for life.

375
00:19:53,459 --> 00:19:56,494
I mean, that's why I do this.

376
00:19:56,496 --> 00:19:58,396
And you are doing a great job.

377
00:19:58,398 --> 00:20:01,966
Well, not if my boys
are stealing T-shirts.

378
00:20:01,968 --> 00:20:04,235
It was during the summer.

379
00:20:04,237 --> 00:20:08,906
Look, you-you can't protect them
forever.

380
00:20:08,908 --> 00:20:11,142
All you can do is instill
good morals

381
00:20:11,144 --> 00:20:13,477
in 'em and hope that they stick.

382
00:20:13,479 --> 00:20:15,079
Is that enough?

383
00:20:15,081 --> 00:20:17,815
It's a start.

384
00:20:19,852 --> 00:20:22,486
What about state?

385
00:20:22,488 --> 00:20:26,123
State will take care of itself.

386
00:20:27,994 --> 00:20:31,529
You just make sure these boys
have the best opportunity

387
00:20:31,531 --> 00:20:34,465
they can to further
their education.

388
00:20:38,705 --> 00:20:41,105
For free.

389
00:20:42,942 --> 00:20:45,076
Always want something for free.

390
00:20:45,078 --> 00:20:47,445
Uh-uh.

391
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:49,780
Mm-hmm.

392
00:20:49,782 --> 00:20:51,415

400
00:21:15,408 --> 00:21:19,110
- Sir.
- (laughs)

401
00:21:19,112 --> 00:21:21,912
Well, I've been watching y'all
since y'all were freshmen.

402

403
00:21:23,449 --> 00:21:25,082
Hey, we going
to state this year?

404
00:21:25,084 --> 00:21:26,817
- Oh, no doubt. -For sure.
For sure. -All right.

405
00:21:26,819 --> 00:21:28,452
I'm sure happy to hear that

406
00:21:28,454 --> 00:21:30,921
'cause I'm gonna be
right up front, too. (laughs)

407
00:21:30,923 --> 00:21:33,291
But, man,
I got to ask you a question.

408
00:21:33,293 --> 00:21:36,327
Now, what happened
with Duncanville?

409
00:21:36,329 --> 00:21:39,764
WOMAN (over radio):
4-38. 4-38.

410
00:21:39,766 --> 00:21:43,567
We have a robbery in progress
at 1030 West Camp Wisdom.

Hey, listen,
I'll holler at y'all.

414
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:51,309
- Sir.
- Slow this car down.

415
00:21:51,311 --> 00:21:53,277
- Yes, sir. -Going 20 miles
over the speed limit.

00:26:35,394 --> 00:26:37,094
Gary, you change the grade
on that paper?

529
00:26:37,096 --> 00:26:38,429
Nah, Coach.

530
00:26:38,431 --> 00:26:40,364
That's the grade I got.

531
00:26:40,366 --> 00:26:43,434
Did someone else change
the grade on that paper?

532
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:46,303
Coach, that's my grade.

533
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:48,439
Nobody changed nothing.

534
00:26:48,441 --> 00:26:51,108
Why the hell are they saying
you failed, then?

535
00:26:53,079 --> 00:26:55,579
Supposedly,

536
00:26:55,581 --> 00:27:00,250
the UIL received
an anonymous letter saying

537
00:27:00,252 --> 00:27:02,086
he was ineligible.

538
00:27:02,088 --> 00:27:04,555
That's bullshit.
He passed, goddamn it.

539
00:27:04,557 --> 00:27:06,523
(phone ringing)

540
00:27:09,562 --> 00:27:11,295
Hello.

541
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:12,896
Yeah, this is he.

542
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:18,435
Yeah.

543
00:27:18,437 --> 00:27:20,804
I see.

544
00:27:20,806 --> 00:27:23,173
Okay.

545
00:27:23,175 --> 00:27:24,408
All right.

546
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,079
Thank you.

547
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:32,983
Who was your algebra teacher?

548
00:27:32,985 --> 00:27:35,085
Mr. Bates at first.

549
00:27:35,087 --> 00:27:37,488
Then I transferred
to Dr. Abby's class.

550
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:45,696
(footsteps approaching)

551
00:27:48,434 --> 00:27:50,401
Freddie, you need
to eat something.

552
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:55,939
They gonna try their best
to make sure we don't play.

553
00:27:55,941 --> 00:27:57,474
Can they really do that

554
00:27:57,476 --> 00:27:59,276
if he's passed the class?

555
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:02,146
They're conducting
an investigation,

556
00:28:02,148 --> 00:28:03,714
whatever that means.

557
00:28:05,718 --> 00:28:08,385
Baby, you always taught

558
00:28:08,387 --> 00:28:11,855
that defense does what?

559
00:28:11,857 --> 00:28:13,457
Hmm?

560
00:28:15,461 --> 00:28:17,428
Defense.

561
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:21,398
Defense does what?

562
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:24,401
(exhales)

563
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:27,304
Wins championships.

564
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:29,139
Coa...

565
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:30,574
Coach,

566
00:28:30,576 --> 00:28:34,211
I don't think I heard that
loud enough.

567
00:28:34,213 --> 00:28:38,048
Defense does what?

568
00:28:39,085 --> 00:28:42,152
Wins championships!

569
00:28:42,154 --> 00:28:44,088
Exactly!

570
00:28:44,090 --> 00:28:47,091
And as long as they're
investigating, it ain't over.

571
00:28:47,093 --> 00:28:50,094
That fat lady ain't sang yet.

572
00:28:50,096 --> 00:28:53,097
Now, you go on out there

573
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:56,567
and you defend your boys

574
00:28:56,569 --> 00:28:59,570
and you win us state.

575
00:28:59,572 --> 00:29:01,238
You hear me?

576
00:29:03,743 --> 00:29:06,677
- MAN: You guys just hear?
- No comment.

577
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:08,512
REPORTER: <i>It was nearly an hour
after the ruling</i>

578
00:29:08,514 --> 00:29:10,214
<i>by the commissioner in Austin</i>

579
00:29:10,216 --> 00:29:12,616
<i>that the official word reached
Carter High School.</i>

580
00:29:13,919 --> 00:29:15,352
Excuse me. Excuse me.

581
00:29:15,354 --> 00:29:16,920
Would you mind, uh,
giving a statement

582
00:29:16,922 --> 00:29:18,589
on the mood here at Carter High?

583
00:29:18,591 --> 00:29:22,593
It's crazy how even in 1988
racism still exists.

584
00:29:22,595 --> 00:29:24,595
So you think
this has something to do

585
00:29:24,597 --> 00:29:26,196
with the school
being predominantly black?

586
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:28,031
I bet you if this school
was mostly white,

587
00:29:28,033 --> 00:29:30,100
none of this stuff
would even be happening.

588
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:31,902
Well, if he didn't pass
the class...

589
00:29:31,904 --> 00:29:33,737
How you know he failed?

590
00:29:33,739 --> 00:29:36,573
So far, those are the reports
that we've been receiving.

591
00:29:36,575 --> 00:29:39,109
Well, as far as I know,
he passed.

592
00:29:39,111 --> 00:29:42,446
And those are the reports
we've been receiving.

593
00:29:42,448 --> 00:29:44,782
Well, there you have it.

594
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,717
Carter has, in fact,
been forced to forfeit

595
00:29:46,719 --> 00:29:49,119
their final three games
due to an ineligible player.

596
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:50,888
That puts Carter out
of the play-offs

597
00:29:50,890 --> 00:29:53,590
and South Grand Prairie in.

598
00:29:53,592 --> 00:29:57,961
They done it to us, and
it's the worst way to go out.

599
00:29:57,963 --> 00:30:00,230
Always been told if they
can't beat you on the field,

600
00:30:00,232 --> 00:30:02,065
they want to beat you
in the classes, so...

601
00:30:02,067 --> 00:30:04,468
They can't do...
They wrong about it.

602
00:30:04,470 --> 00:30:06,103
I mean,
how can they do it the day

603
00:30:06,105 --> 00:30:07,771
before the game?
That's what I don't understand.

604
00:30:07,773 --> 00:30:10,407
JAMES: <i>So what am I supposed
to tell my boys?</i>

605
00:30:10,409 --> 00:30:12,576
<i>You say he passed.</i>

606
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:15,312
Here's a report card shows
he passed.

607
00:30:15,314 --> 00:30:17,815
But the UIL say he failed.

608
00:30:17,817 --> 00:30:22,286
Well, after the UIL got
its mysterious phone call...

609
00:30:22,288 --> 00:30:24,688
- I thought it was a letter. -In
the beginning, it was a letter.

610
00:30:24,690 --> 00:30:27,925
Then it was a phone call.
Whatever. Whatever it-it was,

611
00:30:27,927 --> 00:30:31,762
after that,
Bates' records came through.

612
00:30:31,764 --> 00:30:34,031
Didn't he transfer out
of Bates' class?

613
00:30:34,033 --> 00:30:36,834
Yeah. But then his records
transferred with him.

614
00:30:38,838 --> 00:30:40,771
So, um...

615
00:30:40,773 --> 00:30:44,007
so Abby has a 72.

616
00:30:44,009 --> 00:30:46,476
The UIL has a 68.

617
00:30:46,478 --> 00:30:50,981
And what does Bates have to say
about all this?

618
00:30:50,983 --> 00:30:52,883
- I said no comment!
- But, Mr. Bates...

619
00:30:52,885 --> 00:30:55,152
- But is it true you alerted
the UIL... -No, I have...

620
00:30:55,154 --> 00:30:57,654
- I said I have no c...
- But, Mr. Bates, don't you worry

621
00:30:57,656 --> 00:30:59,890
about your safety? What about
repercussions from the students

622
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:03,861
- at Carter High? -I am
absolutely not worried about

623
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:05,863
my safety. These are
wonderful students, and I'm...

624
00:31:05,865 --> 00:31:08,565
- Let go of my door!
- (clamoring)

625
00:31:08,567 --> 00:31:13,070
JAMES:
<i>Mr. Russeau has informed me</i>

626
00:31:13,072 --> 00:31:15,906
that this matter

627
00:31:15,908 --> 00:31:19,409
is being taken up in the court.

628
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:21,411
However,

629
00:31:21,413 --> 00:31:24,414
the DISD

630
00:31:24,416 --> 00:31:26,583
refuses

631
00:31:26,585 --> 00:31:29,052
to foot the entire bill.

632
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:32,689
And there's a meeting tonight

633
00:31:32,691 --> 00:31:35,592
in the auditorium

634
00:31:35,594 --> 00:31:38,428
to discuss

635
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:39,897
the options.

636
00:31:39,899 --> 00:31:42,566
According to the, uh,

637
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:45,602
UIL,

638
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:50,240
we're not allowed to practice

639
00:31:50,242 --> 00:31:53,944
until they get this thing
figured out.

640
00:31:53,946 --> 00:31:55,846
So, Coach, what we 'posed to do
if we can't practice?

641
00:31:55,848 --> 00:31:58,248
You stay focused!

642
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:03,520
You, of all people,
you're a senior!

643
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:05,956
You stay focused!

644
00:32:10,229 --> 00:32:12,863
And, look here,

645
00:32:12,865 --> 00:32:17,034
don't let this obstacle

646
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:22,039
make y'all lose sight
of the real goal,

647
00:32:22,041 --> 00:32:27,444
which starts
after you leave here!

648
00:32:27,446 --> 00:32:30,714
Champions!

649
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:33,984
Champions.

650
00:32:33,986 --> 00:32:36,787
Champions this, champions that!

651
00:32:36,789 --> 00:32:40,390
Oh, they throw that word around
nowadays like...

652
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,392
like it ain't no big thing
anymore, like it...

653
00:32:42,394 --> 00:32:44,895
like-like it ain't special!
Well, goddamn it,

654
00:32:44,897 --> 00:32:48,231
I'm tellin' you, it is special!

655
00:32:48,233 --> 00:32:51,969
It is a big thing!

656
00:32:51,971 --> 00:32:56,640
A champion walks onto
this field, and you can feel it!

657
00:32:56,642 --> 00:32:59,910
You can see it!

658
00:32:59,912 --> 00:33:03,613
A true champion

659
00:33:03,615 --> 00:33:07,017
is a champion in the heart.

660
00:33:08,020 --> 00:33:12,923
And that's something.

661
00:33:12,925 --> 00:33:16,493
That's something that nobody

662
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:18,495
can ever

663
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:21,465
take away from you.

664
00:33:21,467 --> 00:33:24,334
That's something...

665
00:33:26,472 --> 00:33:29,639
that only you

666
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:33,043
can give away.

667
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:41,985
- (indistinct chatter)
- WEST: Okay, okay, okay. Listen.

668
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:44,955
I understand
everyone's frustration.

669
00:33:44,957 --> 00:33:46,957
But at this point,
we're simply waiting

670
00:33:46,959 --> 00:33:49,860
for the district
to give us the go-ahead.

671
00:33:49,862 --> 00:33:52,295
Look, all I know

672
00:33:52,297 --> 00:33:54,865
is that these young boys
should not be punished

673
00:33:54,867 --> 00:33:56,733
for some grown man mistakes.

674
00:33:56,735 --> 00:34:00,404
And as parents, we should
make sure that doesn't happen.

675
00:34:00,406 --> 00:34:03,673
Well, you know what, no matter
wherever the blame lies,

676
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:06,510
there is not a child
at Carter High School

677
00:34:06,512 --> 00:34:09,146
that is responsible
for what happened.

678
00:34:09,148 --> 00:34:12,382
Nevertheless, it's the children
at Carter who are being punished

679
00:34:12,384 --> 00:34:16,319
by DISD's failure to do
what we pay them taxes to do.

680
00:34:16,321 --> 00:34:18,321
Okay, whoa, whoa.
Un-Unfortunately,

681
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:20,724
DISD<i> is</i> dropping the ball.

682
00:34:20,726 --> 00:34:24,528
But we're here tonight because
we need to take legal action.

683
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:27,931
And the sooner we get a
restraining order motion filed,

684
00:34:27,933 --> 00:34:29,866
we can start
with the proceedings.

685
00:34:29,868 --> 00:34:33,537
MS. EVANS: Oh, so, what,
you need some money? Hmm.

686
00:34:33,539 --> 00:34:36,173
I mean, so what is our guarantee
that this legal stuff

687
00:34:36,175 --> 00:34:38,008
- is gonna work anyway?
- WOMAN: Right.

688
00:34:38,010 --> 00:34:41,878
The only guarantee I can give
you is that my staff and I

689
00:34:41,880 --> 00:34:46,583
will fight as hard
in the courtroom as those boys

690
00:34:46,585 --> 00:34:48,552
fight out on the field.

691
00:34:48,554 --> 00:34:52,622
That's the only guarantee
that I can give.

692
00:34:52,624 --> 00:34:55,625
Whatever.

693
00:34:55,627 --> 00:34:57,561
This is my community, too.

694
00:34:57,563 --> 00:35:01,231
And believe you me,
it's not about the money.

695
00:35:01,233 --> 00:35:03,400
It's about those boys,

696
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:06,036
those young men right there,

697
00:35:06,038 --> 00:35:08,438
knowing that their hard work
wasn't in vain.

698
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:11,074
And them knowing
that they have a village

699
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:13,910
that will come to their aid
no matter what.

700
00:35:13,912 --> 00:35:17,314
That's what this is about.

701
00:35:17,316 --> 00:35:20,984
(applause)

702
00:35:20,986 --> 00:35:23,320
So all those in favor

703
00:35:23,322 --> 00:35:26,423
of seeking
a temporary restraining order

704
00:35:26,425 --> 00:35:28,391
that would possibly allow

705
00:35:28,393 --> 00:35:31,394
Carter to remain
in the play-offs,

706
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:33,830
- stand up.
- (applause)

707
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:49,412
WEST: And for the record,
UIL stands for?

708
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:52,315
University Interscholastic
League.

709
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:57,821
And what exactly do you do
for the UIL, Mr. Winston?

710
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,823
I investigate complaints related

711
00:35:59,825 --> 00:36:03,093
to the No Pass No Play law
in DISD.

712
00:36:03,095 --> 00:36:06,930
Okay. So is it fair to say
that you received a complaint

713
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:09,166
regarding Carter High School?

714
00:36:09,168 --> 00:36:11,434
That's correct.

715
00:36:11,436 --> 00:36:14,838
And when did you receive
this complaint, Mr. Winston?

716
00:36:14,840 --> 00:36:17,274
At the end of the six weeks.

717
00:36:17,276 --> 00:36:20,944
Hmm. Well, if I am, uh,

718
00:36:20,946 --> 00:36:23,146
correct,

719
00:36:23,148 --> 00:36:26,216
I believe that Carter
was declared ineligible

720
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:30,220
about four or five days
after the end of the six weeks.

721
00:36:30,222 --> 00:36:34,858
So, four or five days,
Mr. Winston?

722
00:36:34,860 --> 00:36:37,894
Yes, I'm...
I believe that's correct.

723
00:36:37,896 --> 00:36:41,131
Hmm. And where...

724
00:36:41,133 --> 00:36:45,302
No,<i> who</i> did this complaint
come from, Mr. Winston?

725
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:49,973
Mr. Winston.

726
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:53,143
Uh, well, sir, we, uh...

727
00:36:53,145 --> 00:36:55,145
(chuckles)
we normally

728
00:36:55,147 --> 00:36:58,315
don't reveal the source
of our complaints.

729
00:36:58,317 --> 00:37:00,350
(chuckling): Oh, "normally."
Will you tell that

730
00:37:00,352 --> 00:37:02,652
to the Carter community and
all these Carter kids who are

731
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:04,387
- Your Honor, I object. -being
affected by your hasty decision

732
00:37:04,389 --> 00:37:07,157
- to disqualify their school?
That's far -Counsel...

733
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:09,726
- from normal circumstances, sir.
Your Honor, we have -Counsel...

734
00:37:09,728 --> 00:37:11,861

that the source may be the same

735

- Counsel,

736
00:37:13,198 --> 00:37:14,497

738
00:37:16,435 --> 00:37:18,001

00:37:18,003 --> 00:37:20,036

necessary. -of this court.

740

comin'

742
00:37:27,246 --> 00:37:30,247

you got on?

743
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:32,682
No. But I did see

744

Attention, faculty and students.

745
00:37:34,720 --> 00:37:37,721
I've just been informed
by the Dallas superintendant

746
00:37:37,723 --> 00:37:41,224
that our football team has been
reinstated into the play-offs!

747
00:37:41,226 --> 00:37:43,860
(cheering and applause)

748
00:37:46,198 --> 00:37:50,567
So congratulations to
our football team and good luck

749
00:37:50,569 --> 00:37:52,969

751
00:38:00,078 --> 00:38:02,078
ALL:
Hey, CC!

752
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,413
Too bad, too bold!

753
00:38:03,415 --> 00:38:05,415
Hey, CC!

754
00:38:05,417 --> 00:38:07,083
Too bad, too bold!

Too bad, too bold!

757
00:38:10,756 --> 00:38:12,756
Hey, CC!

758
00:38:12,758 --> 00:38:15,558
Too bad, too bold! Hey!

759
00:38:15,560 --> 00:38:17,560
REPORTER: <i>Well, I have
just confirmed that Carter has,</i>

760
00:38:17,562 --> 00:38:19,562
<i>in fact, been reinstated
in the play-offs.</i>

761
00:38:19,564 --> 00:38:23,566
Apparently, the UIL received
some kind of anonymous letter

762
00:38:23,568 --> 00:38:25,735
to recheck one
of the students' algebra grade.

763
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:27,604
He actually passed the class

764
00:38:27,606 --> 00:38:30,807
on his report card, but there
was supposedly some kind

765
00:38:30,809 --> 00:38:32,475
- of miscalculation due to him
transferring -Yes!

766
00:38:32,477 --> 00:38:34,444
- From one class to another.
- Yes! Whoo!

767
00:38:34,446 --> 00:38:36,246
- As of now, Carter -That's
what I'm talking about, baby.

768
00:38:36,248 --> 00:38:37,781
Will be marching on
in the play-offs.

769
00:38:37,783 --> 00:38:38,982
Play-off bound, play-off bound.

770
00:38:38,984 --> 00:38:40,517
Since the reports
are conflicting,

771
00:38:40,519 --> 00:38:42,319
that, uh, at this point,

772
00:38:42,321 --> 00:38:44,921
uh, we need to turn the, uh,

773
00:38:44,923 --> 00:38:47,257
investigation over
for a hearing, that is.

774
00:38:47,259 --> 00:38:49,259
Not an investigation
but a hearing,

775
00:38:49,261 --> 00:38:51,761
uh, to the executive commission
in Austin.

776
00:38:51,763 --> 00:38:53,997
And until that's resolved,
Carter High School

777
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:59,102
will retain their position
as a contender in the state, uh,

778
00:38:59,104 --> 00:39:01,104
uh, tournament tonight.

779
00:39:01,106 --> 00:39:03,440
ALL:
Our Father which art in heaven,

780
00:39:03,442 --> 00:39:05,175
Hallowed be thy name.

781
00:39:05,177 --> 00:39:07,711
Thy kingdom come,
Thy will be done

782
00:39:07,713 --> 00:39:10,146
on earth, as it is in heaven.

783
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:13,183
Give us this day
our daily bread.

784
00:39:13,185 --> 00:39:16,186
And forgive us our debts,
as we forgive our debtors.

785
00:39:16,188 --> 00:39:18,788
And lead us not into temptation,

786
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,157
but deliver us from evil:

787
00:39:21,159 --> 00:39:23,393
For thine is the kingdom,
the power,

788
00:39:23,395 --> 00:39:26,730

one more time.

812
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:43,773
Was it worth it?

813
00:40:43,775 --> 00:40:45,275
(panting)

814
00:40:45,277 --> 00:40:48,044
Weren't even doin' nothin'!

815
00:40:48,046 --> 00:40:50,046
We just threw dice!

816
00:40:50,048 --> 00:40:51,414

817
00:40:51,416 --> 00:40:53,416
Nah, you was Gamblin'.

818
00:40:53,418 --> 00:40:57,053
(chuckles) And Gamblin'
don't build character.

819
00:40:57,055 --> 00:41:01,257
Gamblin' makes you rely
on luck or chance.

820
00:41:01,259 --> 00:41:04,828
Football ain't about relyin'
on luck or chance.

821
00:41:04,830 --> 00:41:07,664
Football is about making
good decisions,

822
00:41:07,666 --> 00:41:11,468
good choices
on every single play.

823
00:41:11,470 --> 00:41:15,138
Now, if you can't learn that
and apply it to your life,

824
00:41:15,140 --> 00:41:18,775
you're wasting my time
and your time.

825
00:41:18,777 --> 00:41:22,178
Why you think we have a tie
on our record?

826
00:41:22,180 --> 00:41:24,180
Because...

827
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:26,449
we had the same score
as others...

828
00:41:26,451 --> 00:41:28,918

(panting)

829
00:41:28,920 --> 00:41:30,920
Oh, no. No.

The choices we made.

831
00:41:33,925 --> 00:41:36,192
Like you, Derric.

832
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:38,628

835
00:41:43,702 --> 00:41:45,969
excellent field position.

836
00:41:45,971 --> 00:41:49,706

839
00:41:57,616 --> 00:42:00,950
And you, son. You make

840
00:42:00,952 --> 00:42:03,620
<i>a good play and then decide</i>

841
00:42:03,622 --> 00:42:08,024

00:42:24,342 --> 00:42:26,409
Look, Mr. Winston, this...

846
00:42:26,411 --> 00:42:28,645
(sighs)
this was not my intention.

847
00:42:28,647 --> 00:42:31,047
I-I simply confided in a friend

848
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:33,516
about a conversation
that I had with my boss.

849
00:42:33,518 --> 00:42:37,220
Right. And that conversation led
to an investigation,

850
00:42:37,222 --> 00:42:40,256
- which I'm trying to conduct.
- An investigation?!

851
00:42:40,258 --> 00:42:42,659
You had the school disqualified!

852
00:42:42,661 --> 00:42:45,862
What difference
does that make to you?!

853
00:42:45,864 --> 00:42:48,231
Now... you can...

854
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:50,099
sign the affidavit,

855
00:42:50,101 --> 00:42:52,702
or I'll subpoena your ass
to testify!

856
00:42:52,704 --> 00:42:54,404

I advise you to put
that coffee down and help us

879
00:45:08,373 --> 00:45:11,174
- prepare these motions.
- But the judge already ruled.

880
00:45:11,176 --> 00:45:13,409
WEST:
Against the UIL.

881
00:45:13,411 --> 00:45:15,511
It's from the T.E.A.

882
00:45:15,513 --> 00:45:19,215
That's got to be, like,
double jeopardy or something.

883
00:45:21,486 --> 00:45:24,087
All right, folks,
we have exactly 45 minutes

884
00:45:24,089 --> 00:45:26,155
before the courts close...
It's gonna take us at least

885
00:45:26,157 --> 00:45:29,058
that amount of time
to make it through traffic.

886
00:45:30,328 --> 00:45:32,595
We're gonna need
at least three motions.

887
00:45:32,597 --> 00:45:35,198
And honestly, guys...

888
00:45:35,200 --> 00:45:37,734
I don't know what to expect
when we get there.

889
00:45:37,736 --> 00:45:39,502
You mean<i> if</i> we get there.

890
00:45:39,504 --> 00:45:41,204
It's kind of hard to fight

891
00:45:41,206 --> 00:45:43,606
when you can't even
identify your enemy.

892
00:45:43,608 --> 00:45:46,709
So we're gonna...
we're gonna prepare

893
00:45:46,711 --> 00:45:49,312
<i>a bullet for</i> all<i> their asses.</i>

894
00:45:50,548 --> 00:45:53,449
JAMES:
<i>All right.</i>

895
00:45:55,887 --> 00:45:58,554
We're back in.

896
00:45:58,556 --> 00:46:01,090
A judge issued
a temporary restraining order

897
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:04,393
that will allow us to play.

898
00:46:04,395 --> 00:46:06,796
But...

899
00:46:06,798 --> 00:46:09,565
the game is rescheduled
till tomorrow.

900
00:46:09,567 --> 00:46:12,301
(scoffs, exhales)

901
00:46:12,303 --> 00:46:14,437
So go home.

902
00:46:14,439 --> 00:46:16,739
And stay out of trouble.

903
00:46:16,741 --> 00:46:20,076
I'm heading to Austin
for the hearing.

904
00:46:20,078 --> 00:46:23,212
But tomorrow is it.

905
00:46:25,617 --> 00:46:27,884
Tomorrow?

906
00:46:27,886 --> 00:46:30,086
We don't even get to practice
'cause they keep kicking us out.

907
00:46:30,088 --> 00:46:33,222
Now they want to reschedule
the game till tomorrow?

908
00:46:33,224 --> 00:46:34,891
Listen, you have
every right to be upset.

909
00:46:34,893 --> 00:46:36,726
Man, come on, Coach.

910
00:46:36,728 --> 00:46:38,728
Tomorrow night there's gonna be
some people across the field

911
00:46:38,730 --> 00:46:40,897
you can take
that frustration out on.

912
00:46:40,899 --> 00:46:42,565
Especially that quarterback.

913
00:46:42,567 --> 00:46:43,966
I thought everything
was taken care of.

914
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:45,601
What's going on now?

915
00:46:45,603 --> 00:46:48,337
(sighs)

916
00:46:48,339 --> 00:46:52,008
This is what you call
political football.

917
00:46:54,813 --> 00:46:57,113
So what's the adjustments?

918
00:46:57,115 --> 00:46:59,582
I guess the adjustment is,

919
00:46:59,584 --> 00:47:01,918
don't give them nothing
they can use against you.

920
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:04,353
Or better yet,
stay out of politics.

921
00:47:16,534 --> 00:47:18,701
JAMES:
<i>The hardest thing</i>

922
00:47:18,703 --> 00:47:21,270
is not knowing
if we'll be playing or not.

923
00:47:21,272 --> 00:47:24,006
Now, I hate they have
to go through this.

924
00:47:24,008 --> 00:47:26,142
You think the boys
gonna be okay?

925
00:47:26,144 --> 00:47:29,779
You know...

926
00:47:29,781 --> 00:47:31,948
baby...

927
00:47:31,950 --> 00:47:34,183
on that field...

928
00:47:34,185 --> 00:47:35,885
they have this

929
00:47:35,887 --> 00:47:38,988
certain intensity in their eyes

930
00:47:38,990 --> 00:47:40,990
that I've never seen before.

931
00:47:40,992 --> 00:47:43,059
I mean, it's like they're,

932
00:47:43,061 --> 00:47:45,061
they're really locked in,
focused.

933
00:47:45,063 --> 00:47:47,129
(Mrs. James chuckles)

934
00:47:47,131 --> 00:47:49,665
I mean, as long as they're
on that field, baby,

935
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:53,669
I mean, they're so good
it makes me nervous.

936
00:47:53,671 --> 00:47:55,872
State?

- State?

939
00:47:59,811 --> 00:48:01,711
They'll beat the Dallas Cowboys
the way they're playing.

Quarterback drops back.

1060
00:53:58,236 --> 00:53:59,902
He's looking down.

1061

Allen's to the sidelines.

and he could go all the way...
Is he in?

1076
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:31,533
Waiting on the call

00:54:38,242 --> 00:54:39,441
Time-out, ref!

1086
00:54:46,284 --> 00:54:50,119
Coach, I'll catch it.

And look.

1091

Regardless of what happens

1092
00:55:02,733 --> 00:55:05,434
on this next play,

1093
00:55:05,436 --> 00:55:08,237
we had a hell of a season.

1094
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:10,472
A great season!

1095
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:12,574
But you know what?

1096
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:17,579
We've always had a great season!

1097
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:20,549
So right now we all
got a choice to make!

1098

called, uh, destiny.

And you don't get it by, like,
sitting around, waiting for it.

1101
00:55:31,862 --> 00:55:34,763
It doesn't come to you

1102
00:55:34,765 --> 00:55:37,700
by chance!

1103
00:55:37,702 --> 00:55:41,637
It's a matter of choice!

1104
00:55:41,639 --> 00:55:43,806
It's something

1105
00:55:43,808 --> 00:55:47,609
you got to go out and get!

1106
00:55:54,118 --> 00:55:56,018

All right, all right,
all right, all right.

1227
01:02:20,738 --> 01:02:25,574
(players whooping)

1228
01:02:25,576 --> 01:02:27,943
I just want to say...

1229
01:02:27,945 --> 01:02:31,546
just want to say this.

1230
01:02:31,548 --> 01:02:34,950
As that clock was counting down,

1231
01:02:34,952 --> 01:02:38,787
I realized...

1232
01:02:38,789 --> 01:02:40,922
what I wanted...

1233
01:02:40,924 --> 01:02:45,260
out of coaching
after all these years.

1234
01:02:45,262 --> 01:02:48,263
This championship means a lot.

1235
01:02:50,701 --> 01:02:55,537
But what I want...

1236
01:02:55,539 --> 01:03:00,375
what I need...

1237
01:03:00,377 --> 01:03:03,378
is for you all to leave here...

1238
01:03:03,380 --> 01:03:05,781
and be successful.

1239
01:03:08,485 --> 01:03:12,320
Be successful in every
endeavor of your lives.

1240
01:03:14,758 --> 01:03:16,758
Now listen to me, boys.

1241
01:03:16,760 --> 01:03:19,594
This is not the end.

1242
01:03:19,596 --> 01:03:22,564
This is just a beginning.

1243
01:03:26,904 --> 01:03:28,870
And I want to...

1244
01:03:32,242 --> 01:03:35,644
I want to thank you...

1245
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:39,514
from the bottom of my heart.

1246
01:03:41,585 --> 01:03:43,819
So, "champions" on three.

1247
01:03:43,821 --> 01:03:45,253
ALL:
One, two...

1248
01:03:45,255 --> 01:03:47,022

1250
01:03:48,258 --> 01:03:49,457
No, come on in.

1251
01:03:49,459 --> 01:03:51,459
- Come on in.
- (cheering)

1252
01:03:51,461 --> 01:03:52,861
Come on in here.

1253
01:03:52,863 --> 01:03:55,297

1254
01:03:55,299 --> 01:03:56,298
Come on in here.

1255
01:03:56,300 --> 01:03:57,299
Thank you.

1256
01:03:57,301 --> 01:03:58,700
Thank you. Thank you.

1257
01:03:58,702 --> 01:04:01,036
Listen. Listen, boys.

1258
01:04:01,038 --> 01:04:05,540
This gentleman...
this gentleman right here...

1259
01:04:05,542 --> 01:04:08,543
fought for us...
in the courtrooms...

1260
01:04:08,545 --> 01:04:13,348
so we could continue
to fight on the field.

1261
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:15,784
(cheering, whooping)

1262
01:04:15,786 --> 01:04:17,306
JAMES:
Please.

1263
01:04:22,292 --> 01:04:25,694
Guys...

1264
01:04:25,696 --> 01:04:27,395
you're fighting
for what's right.

1265
01:04:27,397 --> 01:04:30,999
There's a goal of team sports,

1266
01:04:31,001 --> 01:04:35,403
and you all have
accomplished that goal.

1267
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:38,073
To see so many young men

1268
01:04:38,075 --> 01:04:41,509
face and overcome the adversity
that you all have

1269
01:04:41,511 --> 01:04:44,312
is nothing short of a miracle.

1270
01:04:44,314 --> 01:04:48,850
You all have made
so many people proud.

1271
01:04:48,852 --> 01:04:50,685
Including myself.

1272
01:04:50,687 --> 01:04:52,921
- Yeah. Yeah!
- Right.

1273
01:04:52,923 --> 01:04:57,759
Carter High, thank you
for a hell of a season.

1274
01:04:57,761 --> 01:04:59,861
A hell of a season!

1275
01:04:59,863 --> 01:05:01,863
ALL:
Yeah!

1276
01:05:01,865 --> 01:05:03,531
(whooping)

1277
01:05:03,533 --> 01:05:05,533
Whoa, hold on, hold on now.

1278
01:05:05,535 --> 01:05:06,534
Hold on.

1279
01:05:06,536 --> 01:05:08,370
Okay.

1280
01:05:08,372 --> 01:05:11,873
I would like to say
on behalf of Carter High

1281
01:05:11,875 --> 01:05:14,542
and the Carter High football
team, thank you, okay?

1282
01:05:14,544 --> 01:05:19,014
And from one great defense
to another defense,

1283
01:05:19,016 --> 01:05:21,082

Hey, hey, Coach?

1761
01:27:23,038 --> 01:27:24,171
Hmm?

1762
01:27:24,173 --> 01:27:26,907
I got it.
I got it.

1763
01:27:26,909 --> 01:27:29,776
Your defense is your offense.

1764
01:27:29,778 --> 01:27:32,246
Now, a good defense
leads to an easy offense,

1765
01:27:32,248 --> 01:27:34,281
which puts the offense
in a better position.

1766
01:27:34,283 --> 01:27:35,916

1767
01:27:35,918 --> 01:27:37,918

It's, um,

1769
01:27:39,355 --> 01:27:42,256
it's a mindset, Coach.

1770
01:27:42,258 --> 01:27:45,292
"As a man thinketh in his heart,

1771
01:27:45,294 --> 01:27:47,361
so is he."

1772
01:27:47,363 --> 01:27:50,097
You can only defend

1773
01:27:50,099 --> 01:27:52,799
something that you
already possess.

1774
01:27:52,801 --> 01:27:55,135

1779
01:28:07,283 --> 01:28:09,383
Hence,

1780
01:28:09,385 --> 01:28:13,287

1808
01:29:16,652 --> 01:29:18,385
Suspects in the video store

You took their money.

1900
01:36:04,593 --> 01:36:07,761
And you did this because
it was simply an easier way

1901
01:36:07,763 --> 01:36:10,697
to obtain money
than to actually go out

1902

Order in this courtroom!

1924
01:37:10,692 --> 01:37:11,858
MS. EVANS:
That's too much!

1925
01:37:11,860 --> 01:37:13,693
I will have order.

1926
01:37:13,695 --> 01:37:16,296
- You don't do that!
- Order in the courtroom!

1927
01:37:16,298 --> 01:37:18,598
- No! That's my baby!
- Order in this courtroom.

1928
01:37:18,600 --> 01:37:21,267
No! That's not fair!
(crying)

1929
01:37:21,269 --> 01:37:23,336
Order, please,
ladies and gentlemen.

1930
01:37:23,338 --> 01:37:25,038
- Order in the court.
- That is not justice,

1931
01:37:25,040 --> 01:37:26,773
to take our babies away!

1932
01:37:26,775 --> 01:37:31,311
(indistinct lamenting)

1933
01:37:31,313 --> 01:37:36,115
Mr. Edwards,
would you stand, please?

1934
01:37:43,058 --> 01:37:45,792
For the robberies you have
committed, I sentence you

1935
01:37:45,794 --> 01:37:50,129
to three 16-year terms in the
State Department of Corrections,

1936
01:37:50,131 --> 01:37:52,532
all to be served concurrently.

1937
01:37:52,534 --> 01:37:54,534
You may be seated.

1938
01:38:04,246 --> 01:38:05,678
You may be seated.

1939
01:38:05,680 --> 01:38:07,513
Mr. Campbell...

1940
01:38:07,515 --> 01:38:08,982
Jessie, do you have a statement?

1941
01:38:08,984 --> 01:38:10,516
Do you have anything
that you can tell us?

1942
01:38:10,518 --> 01:38:12,919
JUDGE: Son, I believe
you have some serious

1943
01:38:12,921 --> 01:38:16,623
psychopathic tendencies,
and, frankly, you scare me.

1944
01:38:19,361 --> 01:38:21,361
And for that reason,
I am sentencing you

1945
01:38:21,363 --> 01:38:25,265
to four 25-year terms

1946
01:38:25,267 --> 01:38:27,100

1951
01:38:46,054 --> 01:38:49,355

I haven't always made
the right decision,

2040
01:44:07,108 --> 01:44:09,275
but I have come
to understand that...

2041
01:44:09,277 --> 01:44:14,113
one mistake or making
an ill-willed decision

2042
01:44:14,115 --> 01:44:17,116
not only affects
that particular person,

2043
01:44:17,118 --> 01:44:20,253
but it affects those that
are around him as well.

2044

I'm proud of where I stand.

2047

But you have a choice:

2048
01:44:32,533 --> 01:44:34,967

mistake that I did.

raised me and my brothers
in church,

2051
01:44:38,239 --> 01:44:39,639
and one of the things I knew

2052
01:44:39,641 --> 01:44:42,074
that I had to give
my life to Christ

2053
01:44:42,076 --> 01:44:44,577
in order for me
to be able to stay out,

2054
01:44:44,579 --> 01:44:46,045
in order for there
to be balance,

2055
01:44:46,047 --> 01:44:48,214
'cause I was not gonna go back.

2056
01:44:48,216 --> 01:44:50,616
Actually, uh, a couple years
ago, I played in the NFL,

2057
01:44:50,618 --> 01:44:54,053
and, uh, a lady asked me
to hold her baby, you know?

2058
01:44:54,055 --> 01:44:57,056
And her husband was like, "Them
guys you played with at Carter,

2059
01:44:57,058 --> 01:44:58,457
they were some criminals,
weren't they?"

2060
01:44:58,459 --> 01:45:00,259
I'm like, "They were
identical to me,

2061
01:45:00,261 --> 01:45:01,661
and you asked me
to hold your baby."

2062
01:45:01,663 --> 01:45:03,663
It wasn't no difference
in me and them.

2063
01:45:03,665 --> 01:45:06,499
I just made the right decision
at the right time.

2064
01:45:06,501 --> 01:45:08,934
If I would have gotten
in that car that one time,

2065
01:45:08,936 --> 01:45:11,337
then I would have got 20 years
in a maximum-security prison.

2066
01:45:11,339 --> 01:45:13,172
