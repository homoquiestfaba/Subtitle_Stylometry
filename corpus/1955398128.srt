1
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:19,918
Freeze! Stay right there!

2
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,280
- Hey, watch a lot of TV?
- Not really.

3
00:04:33,240 --> 00:04:36,517
What the hell is this?

4
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:39,915
Wrong answer.

5
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,918
I need him alive, fellas, so he
can answer some questions.

6
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:18,916
Now I need to know who hired you.

7
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,519
I need to know why you're asking so
many questions about my company.

8
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:30,910
Now I don't think this little plan
of yours is working out.

9
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:35,512
So I think it would best for you to
tell me who sent you here.

10
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:41,517
What's that? You wanna talk to me?

11
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:45,515
I'm all ears.

12
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:11,518
OK, so big deal; you're a bad ass.

13
00:06:16,840 --> 00:06:19,150
- It's over.
- You'll never find it.

14
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,511
I already have.

15
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:33,591
You've made yourself a human
hard drive.

16
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,832
- It almost worked.
- It doesn't matter.

17
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,874
You'll never make it out of here.
The building is completely sealed.

18
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:58,474
- Northwest corridor. Head him off!
- He's going for the roof!

19
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,278
He's on the roof! Repeat, we've got
him on the roof.

20
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:30,836
This side of the building is secured.

21
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,270
Freeze!

22
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,270
Put your hands up!

23
00:07:42,320 --> 00:07:46,678
- What the hell are you doing?
- Leaving!

24
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:36,679
Hey, a guy's got to watch his
girlish figure.

25
00:08:38,360 --> 00:08:42,673
- You alright, buddy?
- Oh yeah, I'm just fine.

26
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,311
Jackpot! It's all here.
Wish I knew what the hell it was.

27
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,672
Hey, Shaun! Taking a beating to get
inside is not my idea of a good plan.

28
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,671
It was the only way to get past
the new security systems.

29
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,673
Sir, I've got something, Vector 419,
mid-central region.

30
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,834
- What is it?
- I have no idea. After entering

31
00:09:55,880 --> 00:09:58,918
our atmosphere, it began holding
a pattern altitude of 7.2 miles.

32
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:02,954
- Entering our atmosphere?
- Yes, Sir.

33
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,279
Code Yellow. Scramble the squadron
to these coordinates.

34
00:10:07,320 --> 00:10:11,678
And contact Weber; tell him we
have a hot track.

35
00:10:30,920 --> 00:10:35,676
Approaching last reported position;
nothing on my screen.

36
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,674
Hey, Big Dog One, thought you
might want some company.

37
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,076
Anybody got the score on the
Raiders' game?

38
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:45,672
Negatory, but my money's on Dallas.

39
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,437
Alright, cut the chatter.
Do you see anything?

40
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:52,915
Nothing here. What are we
looking for anyway?

41
00:10:52,960 --> 00:10:56,112
We have an unknown target, gentlemen.

42
00:10:56,160 --> 00:10:58,914
Copy that, you and the Major.

43
00:10:58,960 --> 00:11:03,671
Got something. Strange signature
half a click dead ahead.

44
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:07,596
- Damn! What was that?
- Unknown aircraft moving 225.

45
00:11:07,640 --> 00:11:11,680
Disperse! He's got a lock on us!

46
00:11:13,520 --> 00:11:17,673
Man! This guy can fly! He's on
top of me! I can't shake him.

47
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:21,917
I'm hit! I'm hit! I'm on fire!

48
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:24,919
Hang on; responding.

49
00:11:24,960 --> 00:11:29,591
Come on! Come on!
I can't hold him! Eject! Eject!

50
00:11:29,640 --> 00:11:32,872
I've lost hydraulics!
I'm going down!

51
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:35,711
Come in, come in!
Can you read me?

52
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,514
He's gone, Sir.
His plane just exploded.

53
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:40,233
Jesus Christ! What the hell
is going on up there?

54
00:11:40,280 --> 00:11:42,511
His flight stats showed everything
A-OK, but then all of a sudden

55
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:44,756
every circuit in his plane just...
just blew.

56
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,680
- What about the target?
- It's gone, too.

57
00:11:51,320 --> 00:11:54,313
We have a plane down;
unknown craft opened fire.

58
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:56,158
Request permission to return fire.

59
00:11:56,200 --> 00:11:59,910
Fire at what?
We show you have no target.

60
00:11:59,960 --> 00:12:03,920
I lost him. Anybody have anything?

61
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,916
- Negative; there's nothing there.
- Anybody have a visual?

62
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,596
No. Nothing.

63
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:13,872
Give me the Joint Chiefs, ASAP!
Is that clear?

64
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:19,110
I need a report, Captain.
What did you see?

65
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:23,313
Unidentified craft; not friendly.
Request authorization to take action.

66
00:12:24,080 --> 00:12:28,199
I repeat, action against what?
We show you have no target.

67
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:30,914
- Sir, we saw something up here.
- Well, you got nothing now.

68
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:33,759
You continue a search pattern
for the target. Is that clear?

69
00:12:33,800 --> 00:12:37,316
Yes, Sir! Alright, maintain a
visual search pattern. Copy that.

70
00:12:43,640 --> 00:12:47,316
2 o'clock!
This guy is at Mach 5 easy.

71
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:53,757
Captain, you are to disengage
and return to base.

72
00:12:53,800 --> 00:12:56,759
Wrong.

73
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,872
Maintain the attach, Major.

74
00:13:05,640 --> 00:13:09,680
I'm under attack! I'm under Attach!

75
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,470
We lost another plane! Repeat!
Another plane down!

76
00:13:13,520 --> 00:13:17,309
Mr. Weber, I suggest that we
disengage.

77
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:22,475
Major, the airplanes are carrying
tactical nukes.

78
00:13:22,520 --> 00:13:26,719
I am authorizing you to arm them.
I want the ship brought down.

79
00:13:26,920 --> 00:13:31,312
You don't have that kind
of authorization!

80
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,315
Flight Commander, this is Major
MacKenzie. You are authorized to

81
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,915
- got hot with your ARM-2 missiles.
- Yes, Sir!

82
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:52,314
ARM-2's are hot! Repeat:
We are hot!

83
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,914
I have lost them again.
No radar, no visual.

84
00:13:57,960 --> 00:14:00,759
Got him! I have a visual!

85
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:03,759
Dammit!

86
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,872
I am in pursuit!

87
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,960
Missile is locked!

88
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:38,310
Sir, the target and all the
airplanes have all disappeared.

89
00:14:38,360 --> 00:14:41,353
I am tracking an unidentified object
that appears to be moving away from

90
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:45,076
the detonation area. It's losing
altitude and will be crossing into

91
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,751
Mexican air space in 12 seconds.

92
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:55,756
I'll expect a full report on the
impact site within the hour.

93
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:18,753
No! No!

94
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:22,232
What's the matter, Padre?
You see what you did?

95
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:24,920
It was God's will.

96
00:15:24,960 --> 00:15:28,920
God's will! This is God's will!

97
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:31,919
Get out of El Descanso while
I'm still in a good mood!

98
00:15:31,960 --> 00:15:35,192
You cannot live this way.
The good Lord will forgive you,

99
00:15:35,240 --> 00:15:37,277
- but you must make amends!
- I don't like it when you quote

100
00:15:37,320 --> 00:15:39,915
the Bible to me!

101
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:43,397
May the good Lord have
mercy on all of you.

102
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:46,911
God bless you too, Padre!
Now hit the road!

103
00:15:54,920 --> 00:15:58,914
Come on! Drinks on Padre!

104
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:04,912
What's the matter with you?

105
00:16:05,400 --> 00:16:09,713
Come on, Padre always pays.

106
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,711
- Hey, hey, hey.
- I scared of you. Sorry.

107
00:16:28,960 --> 00:16:33,318
You see? You tell the priest
that God gave me a sign.

108
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:45,317
It's a goddamn meteor! Oh, you
never seen a meteor before!

109
00:17:12,520 --> 00:17:16,230
So you have a track on the
escape pod?

110
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,920
Escape pod?

111
00:17:18,960 --> 00:17:22,317
It changed direction twice before
it impacted Airman. I would think

112
00:17:22,400 --> 00:17:25,950
it would have been under some
kind of intelligent control.

113
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:30,597
Well, whatever it was, it was
travelling at nearly Mach 5 when it

114
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:33,678
blew up. This could have been
debris that was affected

115
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:37,714
- by atmospheric conditions.
- Look at the trajectory.

116
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:42,957
It wasn't affected by anything.

117
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:47,677
Now I'm waiting for the report
on the impact site.

118
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,555
It was in Baja near a town named
El Descanso.

119
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:55,958
El Descanso, Mexico. Military
intervention is out of the question.

120
00:17:57,720 --> 00:18:01,873
Intelligence says that a drug cartel
operates in the town

121
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:05,358
with ties to police and military
corruption.

122
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,952
We'll never get any cooperation or
confirmation from Mexicans.

123
00:18:12,920 --> 00:18:16,960
I lost 4 pilots up there.

124
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:20,079
If any of them survived,
I owe it to those men.

125
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:23,909
We'll get it.

126
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,910
And now I'll expect that all records
of this incident be transferred

127
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,954
to my information center.
Is that clear?

128
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:37,233
- Do it.
- Yes, Sir.

129
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:41,354
I am curios, Mr. Weber, as to
how you plan to get it.

130
00:18:41,400 --> 00:18:44,950
I know someone who heads a team
that works outside of the government.

131
00:18:45,040 --> 00:18:48,431
They're ex-military. They work for
a company that specializes in this

132
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:52,360
kind of situation.
Expensive and expendable.

133
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,273
They're called an Interception Team.

134
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:59,950
- And what if they don't succeed?
- Well, then Major, if what landed

135
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,832
in Mexico is what I think it is, then
I have been authorized by the

136
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:06,918
Joint Chiefs to launch an air strike.

137
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:09,475
- In Mexico?
- If this thing gets out in the

138
00:19:09,520 --> 00:19:12,240
general public, borders are not
going to stop it.

139
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,956
Now if you'll excuse me, Major,
I have a team to brief.

140
00:20:02,360 --> 00:20:06,957
At approximately 5.15 Pacific
Daylight Time, 4 F-117's out of

141
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:12,356
Edwards were in maneuvers near
the Mexican-American border.

142
00:20:12,440 --> 00:20:15,433
Apparently there was
a mid-air collision.

143
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:18,791
3 of the airplanes were destroyed
at the point of impact.

144
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,594
The fourth was damaged;
flew on into Mexico;

145
00:20:21,640 --> 00:20:24,951
crashed some 60 miles south
of the border.

146
00:20:25,520 --> 00:20:29,355
The airplane impacted the ground
at over 700 miles per hour.

147
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,274
Well, I guess there's not much
left of the aircraft.

148
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,951
True, but what is left we need to
get back as quickly as possible.

149
00:20:37,040 --> 00:20:41,080
The airplanes were on maneuvers for
a Mexican covert operation to take

150
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:45,956
out a cartel later this year. The
black box contained data on the plan.

151
00:20:48,800 --> 00:20:52,760
Needless to say, it would be a
political nightmare if the Mexican

152
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:56,433
government were to gain
possession of the data.

153
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,838
2 questions, Sir. First, what's going
to keep the Mexican government off

154
00:21:01,880 --> 00:21:06,033
our asses; and two, this sounds
like military op. Why us?

155
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,516
The cover story to the Mexican
government is that an Oxi-Tech

156
00:21:10,560 --> 00:21:14,839
airplane crashed; there is a chance
of a Sarin gas leak. The Mexican

157
00:21:15,360 --> 00:21:19,149
government has given us 24 hours
to send in a covert team to

158
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:22,193
- clean up the mess.
- Well, that's real nice of the

159
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:27,474
Mexican government. Sounds like
this should be a walk in the park.

160
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,911
I hope so. There is one other thing.

161
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:35,831
- Here we go!
- I am adding 2 people to your team.

162
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:37,553
- You're kidding me.
- No, I'm not.

163
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:41,514
- Jena Goodwin and José Perez.
- Who are they?

164
00:21:41,560 --> 00:21:44,029
Goodwin is communications
and science.

165
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,836
Perez is an electromagnetic
engineer. Tracking systems.

166
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,156
You know I don't wanna step out of
line, Sir... -Then don't.

167
00:21:52,200 --> 00:21:56,319
But we don't need the extra baggage.

168
00:21:58,280 --> 00:22:02,832
Perez operates a device that will
allow you to track anything.

169
00:22:04,280 --> 00:22:08,274
We don't know if the locals have
compromised the crash site.

170
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:11,313
If they have, they may have taken
souvenirs.

171
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,115
Perez will allow you to track for it.

172
00:22:15,280 --> 00:22:19,069
OK, this Perez guy I buy that.

173
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,114
But what are we taking
the chick along for?

174
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:27,550
She's communications.

175
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:31,037
There was a similar incident
in Canada in 1993.

176
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:35,199
Sir, I think Dave can handle
communications.

177
00:22:35,240 --> 00:22:38,438
I agree.

178
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:40,915
Thank you, Shaun.

179
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,751
This the way I want it handled.
Is that clear?

180
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:48,315
- Yes, Sir.
- Yes, Sir.

181
00:22:48,640 --> 00:22:51,075
Yes, Sir.

182
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,919
Good.

183
00:22:56,920 --> 00:23:00,516
- So you 2 are the pro's from Dover.
- I just started with the company

184
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,917
a few months ago; I was recruited
out of MIT.

185
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:07,158
- MIT? I'm impressed.
- Thanks.

186
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:10,272
Except I have a hard time taking a
college seriously that doesn't have

187
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,916
a football team.

188
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,950
So is that the gadget that got you
a ride on this plane?

189
00:23:23,000 --> 00:23:26,471
Yeah, electromagnetic analyzer, much
more refined that a heat and motion

190
00:23:26,520 --> 00:23:30,355
detector. I can tune it to any
wavelength, from sonar to radar,

191
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:35,115
- electro pulse, microwaves.
- Sounds like it would be better

192
00:23:35,160 --> 00:23:39,951
tracing someone or something
that had been in a plane crash.

193
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,959
I suppose; I hadn't really thought
of it that way.

194
00:23:45,280 --> 00:23:48,956
I bet you haven't.

195
00:23:51,920 --> 00:23:56,949
So what about you? You were on
some interception team in '93?

196
00:23:57,480 --> 00:23:59,915
Yellowknife, Canada,
Northwest Territory.

197
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:03,670
Yeah, we know where it is.
What happened?

198
00:24:03,720 --> 00:24:06,952
An U. S. military plane flying over
the Pole went off course. It was

199
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:10,233
carrying sensitive data that we
didn't want the Canadians to find.

200
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,637
It crashed near the town and
vaporized on impact.

201
00:24:13,680 --> 00:24:17,151
- Vaporized?
- So your team had to go in and take

202
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:20,193
- on some Canadian Mounties?
- We got in and out without much

203
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,232
- trouble.
- Do any of you guys wanna see

204
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,237
- How this works?
- Not really, but I'm sure you're

205
00:24:24,280 --> 00:24:28,194
gonna show us anyway.

206
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:33,197
There's a hunk of metal in
your left leg. It's titanium.

207
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:39,874
Not bad, college boy!
A souvenir from the Corps.

208
00:24:41,040 --> 00:24:45,193
- Can I have a look at it, please?
- Sure.

209
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:53,473
- What else can you pick up with this?
- Anything. Every compound, organic

210
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:56,513
or inorganic, gives off some kind
of pulse radiation.

211
00:24:56,560 --> 00:25:00,270
It's just a matter of tuning it in.

212
00:25:00,320 --> 00:25:04,200
Hey, wanna see my device?

213
00:25:05,400 --> 00:25:09,189
It blows everything up,
organic, inorganic.

214
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:18,910
Thanks.

215
00:25:18,960 --> 00:25:22,192
Nervous?

216
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,189
You should be.

217
00:25:48,000 --> 00:25:52,199
OK, I'm picking something up.
It's 25° north by northeast.

218
00:25:53,640 --> 00:25:57,600
- That's where we're going, Perez.
- Oh.

219
00:25:58,360 --> 00:26:02,354
Hey, would you two mind telling
us what you're looking at?

220
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:08,193
Readings from the impact site.

221
00:26:20,040 --> 00:26:24,193
Could you shut that goddamn
thing off?

222
00:26:27,280 --> 00:26:30,512
Thank you.

223
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:08,191
Shit! What the hell is this?

224
00:27:08,520 --> 00:27:11,115
If this is a plane crash, it must
have been really moving.

225
00:27:11,160 --> 00:27:14,836
At least Mach 5 to cause
that big of a hole.

226
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:18,840
I show no structure left. Whatever
it was, it's gone now.

227
00:27:18,880 --> 00:27:21,873
Mach 5.

228
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:27,918
No F-117 can fly at Mach 5.
What's going on here?

229
00:27:28,040 --> 00:27:31,670
We're investigating a plane crash.
Now if you don't mind, I'm going

230
00:27:31,720 --> 00:27:35,555
to set up a COM back to base
and report what we've found.

231
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:39,196
A big-ass crater.

232
00:27:41,520 --> 00:27:45,594
Take a look around.

233
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,879
Shaun, something's not right here.

234
00:27:50,080 --> 00:27:54,518
I've never seen a plane crash
cause a crater like that.

235
00:27:55,560 --> 00:27:58,871
Either have I.

236
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,189
Hey!

237
00:28:13,600 --> 00:28:17,719
Yeah, Dave, I've got some old man
here. I'm gonna try to talk to him.

238
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:20,195
Hey!

239
00:28:21,440 --> 00:28:26,196
- Go take a look around. OK?
- Oh man! He's always got something.

240
00:28:28,200 --> 00:28:32,194
Dave? Dave, come in.

241
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:41,919
Hey!

242
00:29:19,480 --> 00:29:22,200
Sir?

243
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:30,189
You don't need to be afraid.

244
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:36,194
Senor!

245
00:29:46,720 --> 00:29:51,158
Dave!

246
00:30:02,120 --> 00:30:06,194
Dave! Come on, man,
quit screwin' around.

247
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:22,592
Jesus!

248
00:30:25,680 --> 00:30:29,594
- Shaun, come in.
- What is it?

249
00:30:29,680 --> 00:30:33,196
We may have a problem.

250
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:41,196
- What did you see?
- Nothing.

251
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,677
- What the hell is going on here!
- I don't know.

252
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,996
- Wait, I'm getting something.
- Where?

253
00:31:03,040 --> 00:31:07,193
I can't tell; it's there and
then it's gone.

254
00:31:09,280 --> 00:31:12,591
It's outside.

255
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,192
Propane.

256
00:31:39,240 --> 00:31:42,199
Really.

257
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,397
- You guys are a bunch of real pro's.
- Oh yeah? Well, I wanna know

258
00:31:46,440 --> 00:31:50,912
what the hell is going on, because
this is not a plane crash.

259
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,999
What were you really doing
in Canada in 1993?

260
00:31:54,040 --> 00:31:56,919
I already told you!
A crash investigation.

261
00:31:56,960 --> 00:32:00,078
Bullshit! And Dave just decided
to tear off his clothes and run

262
00:32:00,120 --> 00:32:03,909
naked through the woods!

263
00:32:04,160 --> 00:32:07,392
You know what, Shaun, I say
we do the both of them,

264
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:11,593
find Dave, and get the fuck
out of here!

265
00:32:11,960 --> 00:32:16,591
- Put your gun down.
- Fuck me, man! She knows something!

266
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:20,274
Alright.

267
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,755
Alright!

268
00:32:22,800 --> 00:32:25,599
OK!

269
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:31,236
- Why don't you tell us the truth?
- Look, I'm under orders from Weber

270
00:32:31,280 --> 00:32:34,557
not to ever talk about what happened.
Alright?

271
00:32:34,600 --> 00:32:38,594
I'm giving you new orders.

272
00:32:41,280 --> 00:32:44,910
Yellowknife, Canada, was no
plane crash. It was a big crater

273
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,998
- just like this one.
- And?

274
00:32:48,040 --> 00:32:52,432
8 of us went in. A guy named Butler
was the first to go. It was just like

275
00:32:52,480 --> 00:32:56,918
this; nothing left but his clothes
bloody and torn. The body count

276
00:32:57,880 --> 00:33:01,396
piled up really fast; townsfolk,
kids, it didn't matter.

277
00:33:01,920 --> 00:33:04,799
- We never did get a good look at it.
- Then what happened?

278
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:08,390
They pulled us out.
The U. S. team went in and

279
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:11,478
flattened a 5 mile area with
a tactical nuke.

280
00:33:11,520 --> 00:33:15,480
So you're telling me, the United
States nuked Canada in 1993?

281
00:33:15,520 --> 00:33:18,035
The cover story was an underground
gas leak, or something like that.

282
00:33:18,080 --> 00:33:22,438
Yellowknife is in the middle of
nowhere. The area was sealed off

283
00:33:22,480 --> 00:33:25,473
and half the town was dead, so nobody
knew what happened anyway.

284
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:30,072
Besides, when was the last time you
met someone from Yellowknife?

285
00:33:30,520 --> 00:33:34,878
- I guess I haven't.
- Weber, man! And he sent us

286
00:33:34,920 --> 00:33:39,472
in here on a black box
recovery mission.

287
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:45,472
So you have no idea what we
are really dealing with here?

288
00:33:45,520 --> 00:33:48,672
All I know is that something killed
a lot of people really fast without

289
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:52,475
leaving much in the way of bodies.

290
00:33:56,280 --> 00:34:00,069
Now it's your turn.

291
00:34:00,200 --> 00:34:04,911
There's something moving
towards town, guys.

292
00:34:06,760 --> 00:34:09,434
You go back to the car and you tell
Weber to get us some backup,

293
00:34:09,480 --> 00:34:13,076
otherwise we're gonna get
the hell out of here.

294
00:34:13,920 --> 00:34:16,913
Right.

295
00:34:54,920 --> 00:34:58,914
Goodwin, is the COM-SAT ready?

296
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:04,880
- Goodwin, do you read me?
- Yeah, I'll be a minute.

297
00:35:18,160 --> 00:35:20,834
What do we have?

298
00:35:20,880 --> 00:35:24,510
It looks like Yellowknife.
Dave Lange is missing.

299
00:35:25,160 --> 00:35:28,631
- The rest?
- Well, they know it's no plane crash.

300
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:31,718
I expected that. Where are they now?

301
00:35:31,760 --> 00:35:34,434
They're tracking a signal headed
towards town.

302
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,315
OK. The next contact will be
at 20.00 hours.

303
00:35:38,760 --> 00:35:43,312
If I do not hear from you, I will
proceed with the containment option.

304
00:35:44,840 --> 00:35:47,639
Roger.

305
00:36:21,240 --> 00:36:25,234
- Jena, do you copy?
- Yeah.

306
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,920
- Did you talk to Weber?
- They want us to finish the sweep

307
00:36:27,960 --> 00:36:32,239
- and get out of here by 20.00 hours.
- This is not what I asked for.

308
00:36:33,080 --> 00:36:36,118
I said backup or pull us out.
Do you understand me?

309
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:38,117
Look, that's the deal Weber
offered. If you wanna pull out,

310
00:36:38,160 --> 00:36:40,231
that's between you and Weber.

311
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:43,552
Shit! You know if we don't do
the deal, we don't get paid.

312
00:36:43,600 --> 00:36:48,231
I know. OK, meet us outside the town
on the north side. Do you copy that?

313
00:36:49,960 --> 00:36:52,919
Alright.

314
00:37:16,240 --> 00:37:19,233
Goddamn flies!

315
00:37:41,280 --> 00:37:45,638
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- I don't feel so good.

316
00:37:47,920 --> 00:37:51,072
- Que paso, man?
- Hey, what are you doing?

317
00:37:51,120 --> 00:37:55,000
If he gets sick in my bar...

318
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:59,637
You might say I'm saving this life.

319
00:38:07,400 --> 00:38:10,916
Listen, you don't come back in the
bar until you clean yourself up.

320
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:14,920
You hear me, Hector!

321
00:38:15,240 --> 00:38:19,917
Alright. That's good, Hector.
Very, very good.

322
00:39:16,320 --> 00:39:19,916
What? -
- I don't know.

323
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:08,551
Not exactly the cleanest place.

324
00:40:08,600 --> 00:40:11,593
- They're your people, Perez.
- I was born in Durham, Indiana,

325
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:15,350
graduated from MIT pal.
These are not my people.

326
00:40:15,400 --> 00:40:19,314
Hm, an aristocrat.

327
00:40:20,920 --> 00:40:24,118
- Are you reading something, Perez?
- 200 or 300 people in the immediate

328
00:40:24,160 --> 00:40:27,551
area. Nothing unusual.

329
00:40:32,920 --> 00:40:36,072
- What was that?
- What?

330
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:39,033
I don't know. Something just came
by us with readings off the map.

331
00:40:39,080 --> 00:40:42,118
Part organic elements, part -
come on, there's something

332
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:45,915
- wrong with this thing.
- Check it against the base data.

333
00:40:45,960 --> 00:40:50,557
- OK.
- What the hell is base data?

334
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:55,115
What the hell is the base data?
You know what, you guys are

335
00:40:55,160 --> 00:40:59,552
gonna have to come clean!
What's the base data!

336
00:41:01,520 --> 00:41:04,479
What is it?

337
00:41:04,520 --> 00:41:08,560
It's the stuff you stole from Zircon.

338
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:15,120
Yeah, we know about that.

339
00:41:15,160 --> 00:41:18,597
They had intersected a transmission
from one of their satellites

340
00:41:18,640 --> 00:41:21,633
after the Yellowknife incident.

341
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:25,879
Only the transmission was going to
Yellowknife from somewhere else.

342
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:34,914
The satellite got everything:

343
00:41:34,960 --> 00:41:37,395
Transmission, air strike...

344
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:40,831
Not exactly the kind of shit you
want gettin' out to the public now.

345
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:42,837
So they sent you boys in
to clean up the mess.

346
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:46,874
This is beginning to sound like
one big fuck you by Weber.

347
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:51,396
Yeah, you're damn right.

348
00:41:53,800 --> 00:41:56,918
Take care of the car; come back
here to back me up.

349
00:41:56,960 --> 00:42:01,273
No problem.

350
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:05,280
Come with me.

351
00:42:08,000 --> 00:42:12,279
Why is it that I have to threaten
you just to get some information?

352
00:42:13,240 --> 00:42:16,631
Let's just do our jobs pal.

353
00:42:16,680 --> 00:42:20,674
You know an awful lot about me,
and I know nothing about you;

354
00:42:20,720 --> 00:42:24,270
and that bothers me.

355
00:42:38,120 --> 00:42:42,034
Excuse me?

356
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:49,034
Excuse me!

357
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:54,278
OK.

358
00:43:08,120 --> 00:43:12,273
Have you seen this man?

359
00:43:13,960 --> 00:43:16,759
Maybe they don't speak English.

360
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,760
Algien ha mirado a este hombre,
o algo alguna?

361
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:24,916
The only thing unusual, chica,

362
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:29,910
is you coming into my town and
asking if anything is unusual.

363
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:34,470
We're not looking for trouble.

364
00:43:34,520 --> 00:43:37,911
We're just looking for this man.

365
00:43:37,960 --> 00:43:41,920
You see if your friend...

366
00:43:41,960 --> 00:43:44,919
if your friend was in my town,

367
00:43:44,960 --> 00:43:48,920
I believe I would know.

368
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:52,238
El Descanso is not the
kind of place you come to

369
00:43:52,280 --> 00:43:55,910
unless you're invited.

370
00:43:55,960 --> 00:43:59,920
You understand me?

371
00:44:00,160 --> 00:44:03,915
Yes, we understand,
so we'll just be going.

372
00:44:04,400 --> 00:44:08,314
- Come on.
- Not so fast, senorita.

373
00:44:19,120 --> 00:44:22,272
You're a tough lady.

374
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:25,916
I like that.

375
00:44:27,520 --> 00:44:31,309
But you, you I don't like so much.

376
00:44:40,920 --> 00:44:44,277
Nice gun.

377
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:47,916
Nice jacket.

378
00:46:29,160 --> 00:46:32,710
Find them!

379
00:46:36,880 --> 00:46:39,918
Don't say a goddamn word!

380
00:46:56,760 --> 00:46:58,911
- What do you got?
- Nothing.

381
00:46:58,960 --> 00:47:01,919
- What?
- Wait a minute. That can't be.

382
00:47:01,960 --> 00:47:03,360
- Damn scanners!
- Dammit, Perez! What!

383
00:47:03,400 --> 00:47:06,518
I don't know. It's like whatever we're
tracking, it's energy, it's substance,

384
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:08,916
and then all of a sudden
I get a human reading.

385
00:47:08,960 --> 00:47:12,271
It's the strangest plan I've
ever tracked.

386
00:47:12,320 --> 00:47:15,074
Andale! Andale!

387
00:47:15,120 --> 00:47:18,909
Come on. Let's go.

388
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:06,872
Vengase!

389
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,873
Que paso?

390
00:48:23,640 --> 00:48:27,873
Hablame, hombre! Que paso?

391
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:32,033
What happened to him?

392
00:48:32,080 --> 00:48:36,871
He'll lose his head;
that's what happened to him.

393
00:48:37,320 --> 00:48:41,872
I want you to find those guys.
You hear me? -Claro.

394
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:53,878
Vengase!

395
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:34,870
You cabrones cut Alfredo's head off!
I'm gonna fuckin' kill you!

396
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:22,714
What do ya think, I'm stupid?

397
00:50:48,520 --> 00:50:52,480
Just here to help you out, buddy.

398
00:51:02,720 --> 00:51:06,873
What was that? What was that!

399
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:10,640
You better start talking now.
What happened to Dave?

400
00:51:10,680 --> 00:51:13,991
- What happened to Dave!
- I only know what I told you!

401
00:51:14,040 --> 00:51:17,397
That's bullshit!
Why don't you tell me the truth?

402
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:21,559
Look, the other night, I didn't go
in with the military guys. Alright?

403
00:51:21,600 --> 00:51:25,310
I'm a scientist. I was at base camp.
8 guys went in; only 2 came back.

404
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:29,918
And they were both so screwed up,
I couldn't even talk to them.

405
00:51:30,000 --> 00:51:34,677
I had to read the reports.
It's some sort of creature that's

406
00:51:34,840 --> 00:51:38,197
able to exist in both organic
and pure energy form.

407
00:51:38,240 --> 00:51:41,312
How come they told us
it was a plane crash?

408
00:51:41,360 --> 00:51:44,432
One of my men is dead
because of that!

409
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,837
They weren't sure what we'd find,
so they only wanted you team to know

410
00:51:47,880 --> 00:51:52,477
- when we knew for sure.
- Well, I guess we know now, don't we.

411
00:51:59,760 --> 00:52:02,798
I want to know everything you know.
You understand?

412
00:52:02,840 --> 00:52:05,514
Wait, wait. What happened?

413
00:52:05,560 --> 00:52:08,473
- I saw Dave.
- And?

414
00:52:08,520 --> 00:52:11,513
He's looked better!

415
00:52:11,560 --> 00:52:14,280
Well, what, man! Where is he?

416
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:17,597
He's some sort of alien or something.

417
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:21,873
Alien. An alien? Aliens,
craters the size of Texas!

418
00:52:22,920 --> 00:52:25,389
Does somebody want to tell us
what the hell is going on!

419
00:52:25,440 --> 00:52:29,593
Look, I'm getting paid a lot of money
to track this thing,

420
00:52:29,640 --> 00:52:33,759
to collect as much information as
possible and to keep my mouth shut!

421
00:52:33,800 --> 00:52:37,760
You'd better start... How much?

422
00:52:37,800 --> 00:52:41,760
875.000, plus 1 million Dollar bonus
if I can get a physical sample.

423
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,920
875...

424
00:52:45,640 --> 00:52:48,235
How much?!

425
00:52:48,280 --> 00:52:51,751
A million for the mission,
a million for the physical sample.

426
00:52:51,880 --> 00:52:54,918
- The company's paying you a million?
- Shut up!

427
00:52:54,960 --> 00:52:58,670
Shaun! We're being screwed!
75.000 Dollars flat!

428
00:52:58,720 --> 00:53:00,837
- Shut up!
- I've got a wife and kids to feed!

429
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:05,716
Shut up! What's the point!
We can't spend if we're dead!

430
00:53:07,960 --> 00:53:12,273
- I want to know what we're tracking.
- It's a chameleon, capable of

431
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:17,031
adapting to the structure of whatever
being it comes into contact with.

432
00:53:17,080 --> 00:53:20,915
She lie. Yellowknife wasn't the first
time! There was Russia, South Africa,

433
00:53:20,960 --> 00:53:25,079
Australia. They've been coming here
for a while now. No government wants

434
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:28,113
anyone to find out under any
circumstance. By telling you two

435
00:53:28,160 --> 00:53:30,914
Neanderthals, it may have cost me
my contract!

436
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:34,920
Cost you! Cost you! You're making
800 grand more than me,

437
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:37,316
and I'm doing all the work!

438
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:40,512
Brains versus brawn;
it pays every time.

439
00:53:40,560 --> 00:53:45,157
You know you're lucky my mother
told me never to hit a woman!

440
00:53:46,080 --> 00:53:50,074
- A million Dollars!
- I want to know how to stop it.

441
00:53:53,920 --> 00:53:57,118
Alright.

442
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:08,151
What the hell is that?

443
00:54:08,200 --> 00:54:13,150
Electromagnetic disruption warhead;
obviously it's never been tested.

444
00:54:19,960 --> 00:54:22,953
What is the status of the mission?

445
00:54:23,000 --> 00:54:27,438
- The target's alive and assimilating.
- OK, you have another 3 hours

446
00:54:27,480 --> 00:54:31,360
to terminate if before we have
to take care of it from here.

447
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:34,837
The entire team has been briefed.
We're going hot with the weapons.

448
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:38,157
Alright, roger on the weapons.

449
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:41,153
And I will assume that it was
necessary to brief everyone.

450
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,352
I believe it was, Sir.

451
00:54:44,440 --> 00:54:48,878
A plane crash?
You should have told us the truth.

452
00:54:49,880 --> 00:54:54,159
Shaun, all information on this
situation is on a need-to-know basis.

453
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,553
You were informed as soon as
it was deemed necessary.

454
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:01,953
Come on, man, ask him about
the money!

455
00:55:02,000 --> 00:55:05,311
What happens in 3 hours?

456
00:55:05,360 --> 00:55:10,151
The standing orders are that we
hit the area with a tactical nuke

457
00:55:11,320 --> 00:55:16,156
in order that nothing escapes and
gets into the general population.

458
00:55:16,320 --> 00:55:19,518
They're gonna nuke the town!

459
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:23,156
Weber, are you nuts! Listen to me,

460
00:55:23,880 --> 00:55:26,918
I'm gonna get my team out of here
before you nuke the town!

461
00:55:26,960 --> 00:55:30,271
I understand your concern, but there
will be enough time for you to clear

462
00:55:30,320 --> 00:55:34,633
- the town before the air strike.
- Listen, Weber, I'm going to

463
00:55:34,680 --> 00:55:37,240
evacuate the town and get the hell
out of here. Do you understand me?

464
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:41,559
I am willing to extend the company
contract of 1 million Dollars

465
00:55:43,120 --> 00:55:44,918
for a specimen and termination
of the target to you and to Russell.

466
00:55:48,320 --> 00:55:51,119
- Now that's cool!
- I don't care about the money!

467
00:55:51,160 --> 00:55:55,916
Wait a second, speak for yourself!
Weber? Yeah. Listen! I want

468
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:59,920
the same contract as Per - the girl!

469
00:56:00,040 --> 00:56:03,920
- Yeah, the girl. You hear me?
- Agreed.

470
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:07,158
OK. Well, listen, you can call this
thing terminated, because for

471
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:10,398
2 million Dollars, I will bring the
thing home on a platter!

472
00:56:10,440 --> 00:56:13,911
- You can mount it on your wall.
- And I will expect confirmation

473
00:56:13,960 --> 00:56:17,510
of termination of the target within
3 hours,

474
00:56:17,560 --> 00:56:21,759
or the air strike will commence
in 3 hours and 7 minutes.

475
00:56:21,800 --> 00:56:24,713
Got it.

476
00:56:24,760 --> 00:56:29,152
Listen, you don't have any clue what
we're dealing with here! I do!

477
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:34,915
I saw the thing going through a wall
and nearly tear men in half, half.

478
00:56:36,040 --> 00:56:40,034
And now we got a way to kill it,
Shaun. Listen, man,

479
00:56:40,080 --> 00:56:44,916
2 million Dollars! Man, we pull
this off, we can retire!

480
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:49,673
You don't have any clue what
you're talking about.

481
00:56:49,760 --> 00:56:51,319
I know I'm getting 2 million Dollars!

482
00:57:21,320 --> 00:57:24,154
Hector.

483
00:57:28,440 --> 00:57:32,150
What are you looking at?

484
00:57:33,200 --> 00:57:37,558
The 10.000 Dollars go to the first
man who kills the assassins.

485
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:52,996
Alright, we're gonna need some
way to lure it in and target it.

486
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:55,794
this thing doesn't have much
of a range.

487
00:57:55,840 --> 00:57:58,833
Right. The locals, can you take
care of them?

488
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:02,874
- That's not a problem.
- Shaun, I'm getting something here.

489
00:58:03,080 --> 00:58:06,073
I'll try to get it to track me down.
I'll meet you at the other side

490
00:58:06,120 --> 00:58:09,397
of the town. Alright?

491
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:11,318
Good luck.

492
00:58:11,360 --> 00:58:15,479
Keep your ass clean.

493
00:59:20,080 --> 00:59:24,472
Shaun, you look like you
just seen a ghost.

494
00:59:34,880 --> 00:59:38,874
You can do better than that, Shaun.

495
00:59:57,080 --> 01:00:01,313
Hey, buddy, what was that for?

496
01:00:28,640 --> 01:00:31,872
- OK?
- Yeah.

497
01:00:34,400 --> 01:00:38,872
Shit! Here they come!

498
01:00:48,760 --> 01:00:51,753
Shit!

499
01:00:58,200 --> 01:01:00,396
Why don't you go ahead
and cut ist head off now?

500
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:02,636
So we can collect the million bucks!

501
01:01:02,680 --> 01:01:05,320
Why didn't you tell me what
the hell we were dealing with?

502
01:01:05,360 --> 01:01:08,353
- Are you alright?
- Do I look alright?

503
01:01:08,400 --> 01:01:12,314
Jena, Perez, follow me. Ready?

504
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:16,872
Cover us.

505
01:02:27,720 --> 01:02:31,316
Ay Dios mio.

506
01:03:17,320 --> 01:03:20,313
Shaun?

507
01:03:25,840 --> 01:03:30,312
What the hell is that and
why did you bring it here?

508
01:03:30,800 --> 01:03:34,874
We didn't bring it.
You should listen to me.

509
01:03:35,520 --> 01:03:38,672
They are going to blow up
the town if we can't stop it.

510
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:41,679
What do you mean, blow up my town?

511
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,150
They'll nuke the town. The U. S.
government will do anything

512
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:48,672
to get rid of this thing, including
an air strike.

513
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:54,677
- Air strike?
- They'll level everything.

514
01:03:55,880 --> 01:03:58,952
(Spanish) José, Miguel, Ramón!

515
01:03:59,000 --> 01:04:03,677
Get all the women and children
out of the town.

516
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:10,672
They're gonna get the women and
children out. He wants to fight.

517
01:04:11,480 --> 01:04:14,678
And if you lie?

518
01:04:21,480 --> 01:04:24,678
Hey!

519
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,915
Where is everybody?

520
01:04:27,960 --> 01:04:32,318
Come on out! I got it!

521
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:49,153
I told you I'd get it!

522
01:04:49,200 --> 01:04:53,274
Where is it?

523
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:59,678
This human form is so sensitive!

524
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:05,960
How did that feel?

525
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,960
Feels good!

526
01:06:15,080 --> 01:06:19,950
What are you waiting for?

527
01:06:20,200 --> 01:06:24,240
- Give it to me!
- No, I've got it! Just cover me!

528
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:28,320
Tell me when it's in range.

529
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:32,359
Now!

530
01:06:42,800 --> 01:06:45,918
Where is he?

531
01:06:45,960 --> 01:06:49,237
He's there.

532
01:06:49,280 --> 01:06:51,920
- Where?
- He's there!

533
01:06:51,960 --> 01:06:55,351
Hello, Shaun.

534
01:06:55,400 --> 01:06:59,360
Come on, Shaun!
This is no fun!

535
01:07:11,320 --> 01:07:14,358
Come on! Come on!

536
01:07:34,520 --> 01:07:38,355
Do it! Now!

537
01:07:56,040 --> 01:08:00,353
It's over. Good work, Shaun.

538
01:08:11,440 --> 01:08:14,319
We need to tell Weber the alien
has been terminated.

539
01:08:14,360 --> 01:08:17,637
The COM-SAT was in the truck.
We're gonna have to find a phone

540
01:08:17,680 --> 01:08:21,356
and call off the air strike.

541
01:08:31,400 --> 01:08:35,360
A million bucks right here.

542
01:08:37,520 --> 01:08:41,355
It's getting dark.
OK, let's get moving.

543
01:09:02,200 --> 01:09:06,194
Target in range;
we have a go on target.

544
01:09:06,240 --> 01:09:09,950
We're still waiting on the team.
Delay as long as you can.

545
01:09:10,000 --> 01:09:12,310
- Yes, Sir.
- Let me know when you have

546
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:15,353
a visual on the target.

547
01:09:15,400 --> 01:09:18,438
Right now we're at 18.000
with heavy cover.

548
01:09:18,480 --> 01:09:22,360
Then continue to quadrants
1-3-0 by 2-3.0.

549
01:09:25,640 --> 01:09:29,714
Descend to 6.000 feet.
Wait for my orders.

550
01:09:29,920 --> 01:09:34,358
- Do you copy?
- Copy that.

551
01:09:36,120 --> 01:09:40,034
- I can't believe the phones are out.
- We better get going, guys.

552
01:09:40,080 --> 01:09:44,359
We have only 20 minutes left.

553
01:09:45,320 --> 01:09:49,360
Wasn't this the...

554
01:09:55,120 --> 01:09:57,919
It must have evaporated something.

555
01:09:57,960 --> 01:10:01,954
That's really strange.

556
01:10:08,560 --> 01:10:12,349
Just kidding. Just kidding.

557
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:16,910
That was not funny, Perez.

558
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:19,720
It's not funny.

559
01:10:19,880 --> 01:10:22,998
- Hey, Perez.
- Yeah.

560
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:26,033
Do you know how to hot-wire a car?

561
01:10:26,080 --> 01:10:30,074
Right. You need to hot-wire a car,
so you ask a Mexican-American guy.

562
01:10:30,120 --> 01:10:34,353
- Look: I grew up in France. Right?
- Yeah.

563
01:10:35,320 --> 01:10:38,358
So if you ask me any questions
about wine and cheese,

564
01:10:38,720 --> 01:10:41,519
- I don't think I would be offended.
- I don't think we're talking about

565
01:10:41,560 --> 01:10:45,554
the same thing.

566
01:10:53,240 --> 01:10:57,075
- See?
- I learned that at MIT.

567
01:10:57,120 --> 01:11:01,353
- Yeah, right.
- Good job.

568
01:11:02,320 --> 01:11:06,200
We have 18 minutes left.
Are you coming with us or not?

569
01:11:06,240 --> 01:11:10,359
Yes. I will go with you back
to the United States.

570
01:11:11,920 --> 01:11:15,675
Alright.

571
01:11:27,520 --> 01:11:30,797
Bad day for them. Correct?

572
01:11:30,840 --> 01:11:34,880
1-3-0 by 2-3-0 at 6.000 feet
and holding, Sir.

573
01:11:40,920 --> 01:11:44,231
You realize, Mr. Weber, those planes
are armed with nuclear warheads,

574
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:47,114
and will cross into Mexican air
space in about 8 minutes.

575
01:11:47,160 --> 01:11:51,359
My mission is to contain the
situation at all costs.

576
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,715
We're a long way from
Yellowknife, Canada.

577
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,195
This time we're a lot closer
to the world.

578
01:11:58,240 --> 01:12:00,596
Just remember, Major:

579
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:05,351
The bigger the lie, the easier
it is to sell it to the public.

580
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:11,349
God help us.

581
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:12,350
Authorization Code:
3-2-Tango-Papa-Tango-6-4-1.

582
01:13:17,920 --> 01:13:22,358
3-2-Tango-Papa-Tango-6-4-1.
Copy.

583
01:13:40,520 --> 01:13:44,196
Delta 1, I am hot.
By the numbers please.

584
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:47,711
- Delta 2, I am hot.
- Delta 3, I am hot.

585
01:13:47,760 --> 01:13:51,879
Delta 4, hot and locked.

586
01:13:58,800 --> 01:14:02,077
Good day for you.

587
01:14:02,120 --> 01:14:07,115
I'm going to let you live so
you can pass on a message.

588
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:11,356
But we will be back.

589
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:17,960
I've got a bogey, movin' in fast.

590
01:14:22,720 --> 01:14:26,350
Stay on target!

591
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:32,358
What the - Evasive action!
Requiring secondary target!

592
01:14:40,920 --> 01:14:45,358
Secondary target destroyed.

593
01:15:12,360 --> 01:15:16,195
Secondary target to ground level,
abort primary target!

594
01:15:16,240 --> 01:15:19,312
Repeat, primary target destroyed!

595
01:15:19,360 --> 01:15:22,239
Roger.

596
01:15:22,280 --> 01:15:25,352
Any contact from the team?

597
01:15:25,400 --> 01:15:29,360
Negative, Sir. Nothing.

598
01:15:33,640 --> 01:15:37,350
Sorry, Shaun.

599
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:09,754
You asshole! Why'd you hit me!

600
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:16,517
I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

601
01:17:16,560 --> 01:17:19,359
I didn't mean it. Let me help you.
OK? Take my hand.

602
01:17:19,400 --> 01:17:23,360
You stupid jerk!
What kind of guy hits a woman!

603
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:28,670
- I thought you were an alien!
- An alien!

604
01:17:28,720 --> 01:17:32,350
I'm from Sacramento, you idiot!
