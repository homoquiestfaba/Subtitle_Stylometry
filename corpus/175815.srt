1
00:01:32,826 --> 00:01:35,295
We're detecting a high energy
reaction from inside the target!

2
00:01:35,295 --> 00:01:36,196
We're detecting a high energy
reaction from inside the target!

3
00:01:36,196 --> 00:01:36,796
It's accelerating, and
massing in upon itself!

4
00:01:36,796 --> 00:01:38,598
It's accelerating, and
massing in upon itself!

5
00:01:38,598 --> 00:01:40,088
Is it possible?

6
00:01:46,172 --> 00:01:47,662
No, dodge it!

7
00:01:55,715 --> 00:01:57,706
Retrieve him, hurry!

8
00:02:03,289 --> 00:02:05,024
The target has gone silent!

9
00:02:05,024 --> 00:02:06,126
How's Shinji?

10
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:07,494
He's alive!

11
00:02:07,494 --> 00:02:10,330
Unit 01 has been recovered.
Send it to the 7th cage.

12
00:02:10,330 --> 00:02:12,355
I'm going to the cage.
Take over for me, please!

13
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:17,198
Unit 01 secured!

14
00:02:18,671 --> 00:02:20,974
The pilot's brain waves are
extremely erratic!

15
00:02:20,974 --> 00:02:22,375
His cardiac readings
are very weak.

16
00:02:22,375 --> 00:02:25,778
lncrease power to life support.
Give him a heart massage.

17
00:02:25,778 --> 00:02:27,714
Roger!

18
00:02:27,714 --> 00:02:29,015
Pulse confirmed!

19
00:02:29,015 --> 00:02:31,142
Force eject the entry plug! Hurry!

20
00:02:34,821 --> 00:02:36,556
Emergency LCL discharge!

21
00:02:36,556 --> 00:02:38,358
Roger!

22
00:02:38,358 --> 00:02:40,326
Come on, open the hatch! Hurry!

23
00:02:49,903 --> 00:02:51,393
Shinji!

24
00:03:34,414 --> 00:03:36,449
The enemy's accelerated particle
beam cannon has hit the balloon!

25
00:03:36,449 --> 00:03:38,051
The decoy has been vaporized!

26
00:03:38,051 --> 00:03:39,541
Next.

27
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:54,726
The Type 12 Mortar has
been vaporized!

28
00:03:55,935 --> 00:03:57,163
I see.

29
00:03:58,338 --> 00:04:02,375
From the data we've collected,
we're assuming that the Angel

30
00:04:02,375 --> 00:04:05,478
automatically attacks any
opponent within a certain range.

31
00:04:05,478 --> 00:04:10,216
Anything entering that range
will be targeted.

32
00:04:10,216 --> 00:04:13,820
It's too risky for close range
combat in an Eva, isn't it?

33
00:04:13,820 --> 00:04:15,488
What's the status of its AT field?

34
00:04:15,488 --> 00:04:16,522
It's still active.

35
00:04:16,522 --> 00:04:20,754
It's strong enough that the spatial
changes in phase are visible.

36
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:25,832
Using conventional attacks,
guided missiles, artillery, bombs,

37
00:04:25,832 --> 00:04:28,134
will inflict more damage on
us than on the Angel!

38
00:04:28,134 --> 00:04:32,939
Offensively and defensively it's
almost perfect. A flying fortress.

39
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:35,141
What's the status on its drill?

40
00:04:35,141 --> 00:04:37,377
At this moment the target
is directly above us,

41
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:40,313
penetrating the Tokyo 3 Null Zone.

42
00:04:40,313 --> 00:04:43,249
A giant shielded drill with a
diameter of 17.5 meters

43
00:04:43,249 --> 00:04:46,047
is boring towards NERV HQ.

44
00:04:47,587 --> 00:04:51,758
The enemy is going to attack
NERV Headquarters directly.

45
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,660
Sassy bastard!

46
00:04:53,660 --> 00:04:56,029
What's its ETA?

47
00:04:56,029 --> 00:04:59,966
06:54 AM, just after midnight.

48
00:04:59,966 --> 00:05:03,670
By that time, it will breach all
twenty-two levels of armor,

49
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,002
and compromise NERV
Headquarters itself.

50
00:05:07,674 --> 00:05:09,471
Less than ten hours...

51
00:05:14,914 --> 00:05:17,817
The drill has contacted the
first armor plate.

52
00:05:17,817 --> 00:05:20,453
What's the condition of Unit 01?

53
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:24,257
The defensive armor was melted
down to the third layer.

54
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:28,394
The good news is that the central
control unit sustained no damage.

55
00:05:28,394 --> 00:05:31,798
Three more seconds, and it would
have burned right through the Eva.

56
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:35,468
It will take three hours to install
replacement parts.

57
00:05:35,468 --> 00:05:36,836
Roger.

58
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,104
What's the status of Unit 00?

59
00:05:38,104 --> 00:05:40,573
Re-activation itself should
prove no problem,

60
00:05:40,573 --> 00:05:43,209
but there's still a feedback error.

61
00:05:43,209 --> 00:05:44,277
So it wouldn't...

62
00:05:44,277 --> 00:05:46,446
...survive combat.

63
00:05:46,446 --> 00:05:49,115
What's the condition of
Unit 01's pilot?

64
00:05:49,115 --> 00:05:50,883
No physical damage.

65
00:05:50,883 --> 00:05:54,020
However, his nerve
pulses are up by 0.8.

66
00:05:54,020 --> 00:05:56,356
Still within acceptable limits.

67
00:05:56,356 --> 00:06:00,493
Enemy arrival:
9 hours, 55 minutes.

68
00:06:00,493 --> 00:06:02,762
Talk about you high
pressure situations!

69
00:06:02,762 --> 00:06:04,931
Why don't we just raise
a white flag?

70
00:06:04,931 --> 00:06:06,132
Before we resort to that,

71
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,600
there's one little thing
I'd like to try.

72
00:06:10,002 --> 00:06:14,207
You want a sniper to shoot the
target from outside its firing zone?

73
00:06:14,207 --> 00:06:15,141
Yes, Sir.

74
00:06:15,141 --> 00:06:17,543
Instead of trying to neutralize
the target's AT field,

75
00:06:17,543 --> 00:06:21,280
I believe a pinpoint shot with a
high-energy beam is the only way.

76
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,815
What do the Magi say?

77
00:06:22,815 --> 00:06:25,251
The responses from the
Magi Super Computers

78
00:06:25,251 --> 00:06:28,721
were two affirmative and one
conditional affirmative.

79
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:31,791
Our probability of success
is 8.7 percent.

80
00:06:31,791 --> 00:06:34,160
It's the highest value we could get.

81
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:38,898
I see no reason to reject the plan.
You may proceed, Captain.

82
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:40,633
Yes, Sir.

83
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:43,803
You know how crazy this whole
operation is, don't you,

84
00:06:43,803 --> 00:06:45,605
Operations Director Katsuragi?

85
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:47,974
Don't be rude. It's not crazy!

86
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:50,343
It can be executed within the
nine hours we have left,

87
00:06:50,343 --> 00:06:52,678
and has the highest
chance of success.

88
00:06:52,678 --> 00:06:55,114
It does? Really?

89
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:59,185
But our positron rifle can't
handle such high output.

90
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,253
What are you going to
do about that?

91
00:07:00,253 --> 00:07:03,022
We'll borrow one of course.

92
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,889
Borrow one? You don't mean...

93
00:07:06,993 --> 00:07:09,154
Yeah! The Strategic Self Defense
Force Lab's new prototype!

94
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:15,868
NERV is hereby requisitioning this
Self Propelled Positron Cannon

95
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:18,604
as of 15:00 today.

96
00:07:18,604 --> 00:07:21,841
But this is ridiculous!

97
00:07:21,841 --> 00:07:26,946
We'll try to return this in as close
to its original condition as we can.

98
00:07:26,946 --> 00:07:30,416
Thank you for your cooperation!

99
00:07:30,416 --> 00:07:32,907
Okay, Rei! Take it away!

100
00:07:36,255 --> 00:07:38,849
Be careful. That's a piece
of precision machinery!

101
00:07:41,727 --> 00:07:45,932
Ma'am? Our calculations
show that it will take

102
00:07:45,932 --> 00:07:48,734
at least 180 million kilowatts
to penetrate that AT field.

103
00:07:48,734 --> 00:07:51,862
Where in Japan are you going to
to get that much electricity?

104
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:55,807
From all of Japan. We'll take it all!

105
00:07:58,177 --> 00:07:59,979
We apologize for interrupting

106
00:07:59,979 --> 00:08:03,015
our regular programming for
this Emergency Bulletin.

107
00:08:03,015 --> 00:08:05,818
From 11:30 PM tonight until
tomorrow morning,

108
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:08,654
there will be a large scale
power blackout

109
00:08:08,654 --> 00:08:10,056
throughout most of Japan.

110
00:08:10,056 --> 00:08:13,259
We appreciate your cooperation.

111
00:08:13,259 --> 00:08:19,332
Repeat, from 11:30 PM tonight
until tomorrow morning

112
00:08:19,332 --> 00:08:21,901
there will be a large scale power
blackout throughout Japan.

113
00:08:21,901 --> 00:08:24,836
We appreciate your cooperation.

114
00:08:29,375 --> 00:08:32,211
The drill has just broken through
the seventh defensive layer.

115
00:08:32,211 --> 00:08:34,547
What's the status on our
energy supply?

116
00:08:34,547 --> 00:08:40,286
3.2% behind schedule, but we
should be finished by 23:10.

117
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:42,021
And the positron rifle?

118
00:08:42,021 --> 00:08:44,657
For the honor of Technology
Development Department 3,

119
00:08:44,657 --> 00:08:47,660
we're betting that we'll have
it built in three hours.

120
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,028
And how's our defense coming?

121
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:52,331
Well, using a shield is
about all we can do.

122
00:08:52,331 --> 00:08:54,367
So, this is the shield?

123
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:57,737
Yes. It was part of a single
stage trans-orbital rocket.

124
00:08:57,737 --> 00:09:03,142
It may look ugly, but it's got an
electromagnetic base coating that

125
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:06,178
Section 2 guarantees will stand
up to the enemy's particle beam

126
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,647
for at least seventeen seconds.

127
00:09:07,647 --> 00:09:10,449
Good. Have you determined
the sniper position?

128
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,585
Given the location ofthe target,
taking geographical features and

129
00:09:12,585 --> 00:09:16,289
power access into consideration,
this would be our best choice.

130
00:09:16,289 --> 00:09:19,425
Right. Looking good.

131
00:09:19,425 --> 00:09:21,928
Our sniper will attack from
the top of Mount Futago!

132
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:25,064
The Operation will commence,
at 00:00 tomorrow morning!

133
00:09:25,064 --> 00:09:28,167
From this point on, this operation
will be called "Operation Yashima".

134
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,602
Roger.

135
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:31,627
Now, the only remaining
problem is the pilot.

136
00:09:46,886 --> 00:09:49,055
Unit 01's designated pilot
is conscious now.

137
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:50,890
His examination results
look normal.

138
00:09:50,890 --> 00:09:54,427
Good. Then, the operation
will proceed as planned.

139
00:09:54,427 --> 00:09:55,595
Roger.

140
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:57,756
But I wonder if he'll pilot it again.

141
00:09:58,831 --> 00:10:00,458
Let's get to Mt. Futago now!

142
00:10:18,484 --> 00:10:20,319
Ayanami...

143
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:22,822
I'm here to brief you on the
Operation Yashima timetable.

144
00:10:22,822 --> 00:10:25,416
The operation will begin at
midnight, 00:00 hours.

145
00:10:27,093 --> 00:10:33,032
Pilots lkari and Ayanami will arrive
at the cage by 17:30.

146
00:10:33,032 --> 00:10:37,303
At 18:00, Units 01 and 00
will activate.

147
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:39,639
At 18:05, both units
must be deployed.

148
00:10:39,639 --> 00:10:42,908
They will arrive at the temporary
base on Mount Futago at 18:30.

149
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:45,611
There, they will await
further orders.

150
00:10:45,611 --> 00:10:49,274
The Operation will begin
promptly at midnight.

151
00:10:51,350 --> 00:10:52,544
This is the new one.

152
00:10:59,158 --> 00:11:01,558
Don't show up looking like that.

153
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,690
Sorry.

154
00:11:13,939 --> 00:11:16,567
I've been apologizing
since yesterday.

155
00:11:18,344 --> 00:11:19,834
Your meal.

156
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:26,218
I don't want to eat anything.

157
00:11:26,218 --> 00:11:28,854
We'll be departing in
sixty minutes.

158
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:32,425
Do I really have to pilot
the Eva again?

159
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:33,824
Yes, you do.

160
00:11:34,827 --> 00:11:37,430
I don't want to.

161
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:38,964
Maybe you can be so
cool about it,

162
00:11:38,964 --> 00:11:41,762
because you haven't had the kind
of experiences I've had yet.

163
00:11:42,835 --> 00:11:45,738
I don't want to go through it again.

164
00:11:45,738 --> 00:11:46,830
Then, you can stay here in bed.

165
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:49,368
What do you mean by that?

166
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,477
I'll pilot Unit 01.

167
00:11:53,746 --> 00:11:58,984
Dr. Akagi is already prepared to
rewrite the personal data files.

168
00:11:58,984 --> 00:12:00,886
Ritsuko is...

169
00:12:00,886 --> 00:12:04,982
I'm leaving. Captain Katsuragi and
Dr. Akagi are waiting for me.

170
00:12:09,795 --> 00:12:11,285
Goodbye.

171
00:12:27,580 --> 00:12:32,284
They're really late. We ought
to evacuate to the shelter.

172
00:12:32,284 --> 00:12:34,920
I hacked into my dad's data files.

173
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:37,056
I'm sure this is the time.

174
00:12:37,056 --> 00:12:39,183
Why aren't they here then?

175
00:12:44,830 --> 00:12:46,665
The mountain is moving.

176
00:12:46,665 --> 00:12:48,155
The Evangelions!

177
00:12:58,511 --> 00:12:59,712
Cool!

178
00:12:59,712 --> 00:13:07,278
Go for it, Evangelions! We believe
in you! Beat the Angel!

179
00:13:13,526 --> 00:13:16,228
The drill has penetrated through
the 17th layer of armor.

180
00:13:16,228 --> 00:13:18,753
It will reach headquarters
in 3 hours 55 minutes.

181
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,136
Power supply transfer from
Shikoku and Kyushu is completed.

182
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,696
Beginning tests of each
cooling system.

183
00:13:28,073 --> 00:13:30,234
This is a very delicate piece of
machinery! Handle it carefully.

184
00:13:32,411 --> 00:13:36,682
This thing wasn't built for field
operations. Will it really work?

185
00:13:36,682 --> 00:13:39,585
There's no choice. This is the most
expedient way of gaining our goal.

186
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,086
Are you sure it's safe to use?

187
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:42,621
Theoretically, yes.

188
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,157
However, we're not sure if the
cannon barrel and accelerator

189
00:13:45,157 --> 00:13:47,426
will be able to handle
the stress or not.

190
00:13:47,426 --> 00:13:50,486
This is the first time it's been fired
with such a high power output.

191
00:13:52,231 --> 00:13:56,101
Here are the battle plans
for the operation.

192
00:13:56,101 --> 00:13:56,735
Shinji...

193
00:13:56,735 --> 00:13:57,002
Shinji...

194
00:13:57,002 --> 00:13:57,303
Your Unit 01 will be the gunner.

195
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,471
Your Unit 01 will be the gunner.

196
00:13:59,471 --> 00:14:00,539
Right.

197
00:14:00,539 --> 00:14:03,075
Rei, you will cover him
with Unit 00.

198
00:14:03,075 --> 00:14:04,076
Right.

199
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:08,347
This is because Shinji has a higher
sync ratio with Unit 01,

200
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:12,017
and this operation will require
exceptional precision.

201
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:13,853
Since the positron beam will be
influenced by the Earth's gravity,

202
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:17,556
magnetic fields and rotation, it
will not fire in a straight line.

203
00:14:17,556 --> 00:14:20,793
You must remember to make
adjustments for these deviations.

204
00:14:20,793 --> 00:14:23,863
You must penetrate the
core precisely.

205
00:14:23,863 --> 00:14:27,867
But I've never practiced this!

206
00:14:27,867 --> 00:14:29,268
Don't worry.

207
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,303
Just do what the manual says.

208
00:14:31,303 --> 00:14:35,341
When the indicators converge in
the center, pull the trigger.

209
00:14:35,341 --> 00:14:37,843
The computers will
handle the rest.

210
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:41,213
Also, be aware that before you can
fire the rifle a second time,

211
00:14:41,213 --> 00:14:45,050
you'll have to wait for the unit to
cool, replace the fuses and reload.

212
00:14:45,050 --> 00:14:48,220
And if I miss? Or if the
enemy shoots back?

213
00:14:48,220 --> 00:14:50,456
Don't think like that.

214
00:14:50,456 --> 00:14:53,084
You must destroy it with
your first shot.

215
00:14:54,994 --> 00:14:57,796
So I have no choice.

216
00:14:57,796 --> 00:15:00,032
l...

217
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:02,401
I'm just to defend Unit 01, correct?

218
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:03,969
Yes.

219
00:15:03,969 --> 00:15:05,738
Understood.

220
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,841
It's time. Get geared up.

221
00:15:08,841 --> 00:15:10,331
Right!

222
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:21,921
Maybe...

223
00:15:21,921 --> 00:15:23,411
...this is our last day alive.

224
00:15:25,024 --> 00:15:26,514
Why do you say that?

225
00:15:30,963 --> 00:15:32,362
You won't die.

226
00:15:34,266 --> 00:15:35,756
I'll protect you.

227
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:20,111
Why do you pilot this?

228
00:16:23,882 --> 00:16:25,584
Because I'm bonded to it.

229
00:16:25,584 --> 00:16:26,414
Bonded?

230
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:29,912
Yes, it's a bond.

231
00:16:31,523 --> 00:16:33,492
You mean to my father?

232
00:16:33,492 --> 00:16:34,652
To all people.

233
00:16:35,828 --> 00:16:39,498
You're very strong, Ayanami.

234
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:43,469
I have nothing else.

235
00:16:43,469 --> 00:16:45,334
What do you mean, "you
have nothing else"?

236
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,700
It's time. Let's go.

237
00:16:50,776 --> 00:16:53,108
Goodbye.

238
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:10,119
The time is now 00:00.

239
00:17:14,700 --> 00:17:16,535
Commencing operation.

240
00:17:16,535 --> 00:17:20,773
Shinji, we're entrusting you with
all the energy of Japan.

241
00:17:20,773 --> 00:17:21,707
I'm counting on you.

242
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:22,274
I'm counting on you.

243
00:17:22,274 --> 00:17:22,808
Understood.

244
00:17:22,808 --> 00:17:25,010
lnitiate primary connection.

245
00:17:25,010 --> 00:17:28,309
lnitiating powertransmission from
Districts number 1 through 803.

246
00:17:37,322 --> 00:17:39,381
Voltage is rising. Water exchange
unit reaching pressure zone.

247
00:17:40,426 --> 00:17:42,951
All cooling systems operating
at full power!

248
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:48,559
Temperature stable.
No problems detected.

249
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:52,104
Positron charge is nominal.

250
00:17:52,104 --> 00:17:53,628
lnitiate second connection!

251
00:17:54,940 --> 00:17:57,009
All accelerators engaging.

252
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,445
Activate convergence unit.

253
00:17:59,445 --> 00:18:02,247
Transmitting all power to Mount
Futago temporary substation.

254
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:04,783
No problems reported with
third connection.

255
00:18:04,783 --> 00:18:07,152
Release final safety systems.

256
00:18:07,152 --> 00:18:08,278
Pull sear up!

257
00:18:10,756 --> 00:18:16,061
Error correction for Earth rotation
and gravity is 0.0009.

258
00:18:16,061 --> 00:18:18,996
Voltage is 0.2 short of critical.

259
00:18:25,971 --> 00:18:27,836
Seventh and tenth
connections engaged!

260
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:31,341
Transmitting all energy
to the positron rifle!

261
00:18:32,878 --> 00:18:33,712
8...

262
00:18:33,712 --> 00:18:34,746

263
00:18:34,746 --> 00:18:35,747
6...

264
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:36,081
5...

265
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:36,682
High energy output detected

266
00:18:36,682 --> 00:18:37,683
High energy output detected
inside the target!

267
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:37,983
High energy output detected
inside the target!

268
00:18:37,983 --> 00:18:38,784
It can't be!

269
00:18:38,784 --> 00:18:39,818
2...

270
00:18:39,818 --> 00:18:41,120
1...

271
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:41,848
Fire!

272
00:19:01,673 --> 00:19:03,163
Did we miss?

273
00:19:12,351 --> 00:19:15,220
The enemy drill has broken
into the GeoFront!

274
00:19:15,220 --> 00:19:16,380
Hurry! Line up a second shot!

275
00:19:17,523 --> 00:19:20,192
Replacing fuses!
lnitiating recharge!

276
00:19:20,192 --> 00:19:21,819
Barrel cooling in progress!

277
00:19:23,929 --> 00:19:25,831
We've got another high energy
reading building inside the target!

278
00:19:25,831 --> 00:19:26,820
No, not now!

279
00:19:29,501 --> 00:19:30,991
Shinji!

280
00:19:38,443 --> 00:19:39,933
Ayanami!

281
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,848
That shield can't last long!

282
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:43,882
Are we ready yet? !

283
00:19:43,882 --> 00:19:44,678
Ten more seconds.

284
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,675
Hurry up!

285
00:19:50,489 --> 00:19:51,979
Hurry up!

286
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,553
We got it!

287
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:06,560
Ayanami!

288
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:38,437
Ayanami!

289
00:20:38,437 --> 00:20:40,105
Are you all right? !

290
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:41,595
Ayanami!

291
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:57,953
Don't say... Don't say that
you have nothing else.

292
00:21:00,759 --> 00:21:04,456
Don't say goodbye when you leave
on a mission. It's too sad.

293
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,046
Why are you crying?

294
00:21:27,219 --> 00:21:31,952
I'm sorry. I don't know what to do
or feel at a time like this.

295
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:35,991
Why don't you try smiling?

296
00:23:06,084 --> 00:23:11,056
NERV isn't the only agency
trying to combat the Angels.

297
00:23:11,056 --> 00:23:14,593
When the giant humanoid robot
created by a civilian corporation

298
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:17,462
goes out of control during
its official trial run,

299
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:21,099
it's up to Eva Unit 01 to
catch the rampaging Jet alone.

300
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:24,503
Can Misato stop its nuclear
reactor from melting down?

301
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:27,272
It's the next episode:
"The Human Creation".

302
00:23:27,272 --> 00:23:30,332
And of course, I'll give you
lots of fan service too!
