Thanks for all your help, specially with a...
Oh anytime, hope to see ya again.

00:02:16,821 --> 00:02:18,821
You silly dog, you always come back.

It's a hatchet.
To help you brave the Canadian wild.

00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,612
Try it on.
- Mom I have some dignity.

11
00:02:54,612 --> 00:02:57,353
Come on, goes on your belt loop.

12
00:03:03,999 --> 00:03:08,391
It looks great, let me take a picture.
- Mom you've cross the line! Come on!

13
00:03:18,589 --> 00:03:21,147
Brian, I was hoping we
could talk before you left.

14
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,348
Sure Mom.
Guitar solo, check it out, check it out, check it...

00:03:49,938 --> 00:03:50,938
Ya thats me.

17
00:03:50,938 --> 00:03:53,917
I'am June Robeson,
this is my son Brian.

18
00:03:53,917 --> 00:03:56,680
He's supposed to fly with
you to the Clayton oil fields.

19
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:59,864
Yeah, I got a letter from
Brad Robeson at the camp.

20
00:03:59,864 --> 00:04:02,802
That's Brian's Dad.
He's spending the summer with him.

21
00:04:03,895 --> 00:04:06,689
Do you have any luggage?
Or you just going to wear that all summer?

22
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,934
Here you go.

23
00:04:15,641 --> 00:04:19,018
Well hun, have a good time

24
00:04:19,510 --> 00:04:23,161
I want a full report on you all're
doing, when you get back ok? Ok.

25
00:04:23,392 --> 00:04:26,924
Call me when you get there.
Or I'll cut the mountains after you.

26
00:04:26,924 --> 00:04:28,259
Yeah right!

27
00:04:29,176 --> 00:04:30,675
Let me say bye to Sammy.

28
00:04:34,101 --> 00:04:35,401
Bye Sammy...

29
00:04:41,922 --> 00:04:44,754
Bye Mom.
- Bye.

30
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:18,276
I didn't give you the
speal before we left...

31
00:05:19,149 --> 00:05:21,494
The exit is where you came in.

32
00:05:22,251 --> 00:05:25,109
There's a fire 
extinguisher behind the seat

33
00:05:25,442 --> 00:05:28,183
first aid kit, life vest right next to it.

34
00:05:28,573 --> 00:05:31,593
And way back there's an emergency pack

35
00:05:31,593 --> 00:05:35,113
food, and survival gear
in it, if we go down.

36
00:05:37,038 --> 00:05:38,262
You never know.

37
00:05:44,437 --> 00:05:48,053
Did you father been away for awhile?

38
00:05:49,937 --> 00:05:51,669
There're divorced.

39
00:05:55,826 --> 00:05:59,541
Brian!
Brian!

40
00:06:00,352 --> 00:06:04,391
Brian, come on let's throw the fris.
Come on.

41
00:06:04,391 --> 00:06:06,726
Nah I gotta go help Mom.

42
00:06:06,726 --> 00:06:12,894
Oh we need more lighter fluid.
Go, go on we've got it wonder control.

43
00:06:13,568 --> 00:06:15,368
I don't know about that.

44
00:06:16,477 --> 00:06:18,777
You girls need a man's help, do ya?

45
00:06:27,231 --> 00:06:29,585
Would you take the controls for a minute?

46
00:06:30,467 --> 00:06:33,728
I don't know how to fly.
- There's nothing to it!

47
00:06:34,255 --> 00:06:37,387
This plaines practically fly themselves, see?

48
00:06:37,993 --> 00:06:39,124
No hands.

49
00:06:44,617 --> 00:06:47,288
Go on, go on try it, put
your feet on the rudder hills. Go on!

50
00:06:50,136 --> 00:06:52,051
Oh oh oh, not so much...

51
00:06:55,687 --> 00:06:57,951
Just gently, ok?

52
00:06:58,828 --> 00:07:01,816
Take it easy.
There you go.

53
00:07:02,806 --> 00:07:06,324
Can you feel it? Go on give it a
little more, give it again, there you go.

54
00:07:06,948 --> 00:07:07,948
See that?

55
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:12,655
Now you're a pilot.

56
00:07:13,735 --> 00:07:15,808
Just hold it steady for a minute.

57
00:07:21,444 --> 00:07:23,017
What...?

58
00:07:35,324 --> 00:07:37,354
I think you better take over.

59
00:07:43,914 --> 00:07:45,044
Thanks.

60
00:07:48,497 --> 00:07:50,910
You see down there?

61
00:07:52,006 --> 00:07:54,873
One day I fished that lake
with landing handy (fish net).

62
00:07:56,635 --> 00:07:58,722
Had one a hell of a time, i can tell ya.

63
00:08:01,222 --> 00:08:03,917
What's it's name?
- It doens't have a name.

64
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,432
There's too many off them
no name, it's just a lake!

65
00:08:23,232 --> 00:08:24,537
Dad!

66
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:42,282
Son of a bitch!

67
00:08:52,534 --> 00:08:54,791

You awake honey?

93
00:13:52,925 --> 00:13:55,112

94
00:13:56,502 --> 00:13:59,253
Honey there's something we

95
00:15:38,797 --> 00:15:40,980

96
00:18:30,565 --> 00:18:31,865

No!

103
00:20:07,908 --> 00:20:08,908
God ... no.

104
00:20:11,816 --> 00:20:12,914
No.

105
00:20:15,630 --> 00:20:17,430
Please ... no.

106
00:22:09,151 --> 00:22:10,301
Brian.

107
00:22:10,869 --> 00:22:12,025
Brian.

108
00:22:20,499 --> 00:22:21,477
Brian.

109
00:22:23,410 --> 00:22:24,556
Brian.

110
00:22:28,695 --> 00:22:30,593
Go find Brian, go find him.

111
00:22:43,521 --> 00:22:46,380
Damn!
- What are you doing?

112
00:22:49,534 --> 00:22:50,938
What kinda game is this?

113
00:22:50,938 --> 00:22:53,058
Brad.
- He's right here.

114
00:22:54,978 --> 00:22:58,973
Well? You better talk to me young man!
Leave him alone!

115
00:23:00,187 --> 00:23:02,435
What the hell is going on here?

116
00:23:39,226 --> 00:23:41,736
The old gum...

117
00:24:39,781 --> 00:24:43,281
I'm of a higher intelligence
you've invaded my domain.

118
00:24:43,281 --> 00:24:44,993
Prepare to die!

119
00:25:19,448 --> 00:25:20,448
Not again!

120
00:26:55,676 --> 00:26:57,276
What a mistake.

121
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:01,390
No more puke berries.

122
00:28:28,704 --> 00:28:38,815
Amen for a pizza.
Pepperoni, onions ... even anchovies.

123
00:28:45,020 --> 00:28:47,033
Anchovies ...

124
00:30:10,658 --> 00:30:13,320
There's got to be something out
there to eat besides snake.

125
00:34:04,057 --> 00:34:06,262
Ok, now...

126
00:34:06,702 --> 00:34:10,871
Plane crashed, climbed the mountain.

127
00:34:13,890 --> 00:34:18,690
Ate puke berries
and got the good ones.

128
00:35:27,009 --> 00:35:27,759
Dad.

129
00:35:38,981 --> 00:35:40,181
Dad ...!

130
00:36:14,258 --> 00:36:16,108
Little people ate my berries?

131
00:36:18,070 --> 00:36:23,226
Monkeys? Some kind of little
northern monkey ate my berries?

132
00:36:24,172 --> 00:36:25,919
I can't believe this!

133
00:37:04,576 --> 00:37:07,917
Hey bud what you looking at?

134
00:37:27,316 --> 00:37:29,676
Ah the monkey-man.

135
00:37:30,271 --> 00:37:32,649
Keep away from my berries, pal.

136
00:37:46,874 --> 00:37:49,033
There's got to be more berries around here.

137
00:38:15,621 --> 00:38:16,621
The lake!

138
00:38:22,715 --> 00:38:25,315
The lake!
The lake!

139
00:38:26,261 --> 00:38:28,361
Where's ...
Oh, my God ...

140
00:38:30,908 --> 00:38:32,544
Where's the lake?

141
00:39:24,380 --> 00:39:27,225
Oh, man, I can't do this...

142
00:40:21,981 --> 00:40:23,381
This is seak!

143
00:41:04,159 --> 00:41:08,159
*Nobody loves me* ...
*Everybody hates me ...*

144
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:10,648
*I'm gonna eat some worms*

145
00:41:11,893 --> 00:41:15,493
*Nobody loves me* ...
*Everybody hates me ...*

146
00:41:15,493 --> 00:41:18,165
*I'm gonna eat some worms*

147
00:41:43,537 --> 00:41:46,717
Not again!
Get out of here monkey-man!

148
00:42:58,428 --> 00:43:00,086
Time for lunch!

149
00:44:24,257 --> 00:44:25,557
What a piece of junk!

150
00:45:04,429 --> 00:45:06,429
What the hell is going on here?

151
00:45:49,572 --> 00:45:50,532
Allright!
Yeah!

152
00:47:06,553 --> 00:47:09,141
Stupid money it won't even light on fire.

153
00:47:40,110 --> 00:47:41,118
Come on...

154
00:47:44,958 --> 00:47:46,141
Come on...

155
00:47:51,686 --> 00:47:55,189
Come on...
Come on!

156
00:48:00,090 --> 00:48:02,182
My fire gun.

157
00:48:07,271 --> 00:48:08,321
Twigs.

158
00:48:09,234 --> 00:48:11,234
Come on ...
Yes!

159
00:48:19,187 --> 00:48:20,187
More.

160
00:48:43,541 --> 00:48:44,741
No mosquitos.

161
00:48:46,848 --> 00:48:48,694
No mud!

162
00:48:49,198 --> 00:48:50,859
No mud

163
00:48:51,263 --> 00:48:52,703
No mud

164
00:50:11,841 --> 00:50:15,123
Oh, yes ... yes.

165
00:50:50,473 --> 00:50:55,056
So sir what would you care for tomorrow? The red
lobster, the red snapper or the Filet Mignon?

166
00:50:56,093 --> 00:51:01,013
Oh no, no I just think I'll stick with
my trout its suits my palate.

167
00:51:01,013 --> 00:51:02,603
I'm just fine thank you.

168
00:53:02,473 --> 00:53:07,428
Hello, there's anybody out there?

169
00:53:10,064 --> 00:53:11,312

00:55:57,983 --> 00:55:59,150
Brian.

177
00:56:00,086 --> 00:56:01,349
Brian.

178
00:58:03,281 --> 00:58:04,241

179
00:58:22,427 --> 00:58:25,370
Go away...

181
01:01:23,317 --> 01:01:25,343
Not this time!

182
01:03:13,321 --> 01:03:14,321
