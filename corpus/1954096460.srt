00:01:01,261 --> 00:01:04,822
<i>Holidays,</i>
<i>the whole world loves them.</i>

2
00:01:05,999 --> 00:01:08,160
<i>That's why there are so many.</i>

3
00:01:09,235 --> 00:01:10,327
<i>Christmas.</i>

4
00:01:11,604 --> 00:01:12,730
<i>Easter.</i>

5
00:01:13,339 --> 00:01:15,000
<i>Hanukkah.</i>

6
00:01:15,341 --> 00:01:17,332
<i>The one thing they all have in common...</i>

7
00:01:17,777 --> 00:01:20,678
<i> food, like Thanksgiving.</i>

8
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,044
<i>That's what it's all about.</i>

9
00:01:23,216 --> 00:01:26,743
<i>A time to sit down over</i>
<i>the holiday meal.</i>

10
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,184
<i>It's everyone's favorite part.</i>

11
00:01:29,355 --> 00:01:32,449
<i>Unless of course, you are the meal.</i>

12
00:01:37,597 --> 00:01:39,588
<i>My name is Reggie, by the way.</i>

13
00:01:39,766 --> 00:01:42,257
<i>I'm the turkey screaming for his life.</i>

14
00:01:42,635 --> 00:01:44,296
Ah! Ah!

15
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:47,031
<i>Thanksgiving is a turkey's</i>
<i>worst nightmare.</i>

16
00:01:47,207 --> 00:01:49,266
<i>And trust me, I've tried to warn them.</i>

17
00:01:50,443 --> 00:01:51,535
You don't get it!

18
00:01:51,711 --> 00:01:54,874
They're fattening us up
so they can eat us!

19
00:01:55,048 --> 00:01:58,279
- It's such a beautiful day.
- This is the best day ever!

20
00:01:58,451 --> 00:02:00,146
Probably the best day of my life.

21
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:01,981
- Hey, corn!
- Corn!

22
00:02:02,555 --> 00:02:05,046
<i>And every year,</i>
<i>they don't listen.</i>

23
00:02:05,225 --> 00:02:07,557
<i>I'm not gonna dress it up.</i>
<i>Turkeys are dumb.</i>

24
00:02:07,727 --> 00:02:08,785
Corn. Corn.

25
00:02:08,962 --> 00:02:11,556
<i>Really dumb.</i>

26
00:02:12,765 --> 00:02:13,993
Hey, guys, check it out.

27
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:20,399
<i>Turkeys are so dumb,</i>
<i>they think the farmer's their friend.</i>

28
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:21,813
- He's so cool!
- He's the best.

29
00:02:21,841 --> 00:02:23,331
- He's so nice.
- I love the farmer!

30
00:02:24,978 --> 00:02:25,967
Hey!

31
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:29,480
Percy's going to turkey paradise!

32
00:02:31,184 --> 00:02:33,778
Turkey paradise...

33
00:02:35,688 --> 00:02:38,589
Go, Percy, you lucky son of a gun!

34
00:02:38,758 --> 00:02:39,816
<i>See what I mean?</i>

35
00:02:39,993 --> 00:02:42,621
<i>But the truth is, I've always been</i>
<i>a little bit different.</i>

36
00:02:43,930 --> 00:02:47,195
<i>From the very beginning,</i>
<i>I never felt like I fit in.</i>

37
00:02:47,367 --> 00:02:50,302
Our world is made of corn.

38
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:51,801
Leafy corn.

39
00:02:52,005 --> 00:02:54,030
- Oh!
- Corn-corn!

40
00:02:54,207 --> 00:02:56,937
Fire corn!

41
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:00,602
That's an awesome theory, but I think
they actually call that the sun.

42
00:03:01,781 --> 00:03:03,305
Out! Out!

43
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:05,280
<i>But I kept trying...</i>

44
00:03:05,451 --> 00:03:07,783
- Yeah... no.
- Hey, Aspen.

45
00:03:07,954 --> 00:03:09,819
Your wings must be tired

46
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:14,016
because it looks like you flew
straight out of heaven.

47
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:15,456
Seriously?

48
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:18,121
You wanna fly, Bobby?

49
00:03:19,832 --> 00:03:22,858
- I guess it's just you and me.
- Beat it, weirdo!

50
00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,560
Yeah, that's what I thought!

51
00:03:28,241 --> 00:03:30,334
<i>- And trying.</i>

52
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:33,308
<i>When you're in a flock,</i>
<i>you know you belong...</i>

53
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:35,513
<i> to something bigger,</i>

54
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:37,343
<i>that you're not alone.</i>

55
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,041
Reggie, it's chilly!

56
00:03:39,219 --> 00:03:40,020
Reggie, you're cold!

57
00:03:40,186 --> 00:03:41,380
Get out of here, Reggie!

58
00:03:43,656 --> 00:03:45,647
At least that's what I hear.

59
00:03:51,197 --> 00:03:54,428
Listen up!
Reggie's been right all along.

60
00:03:54,601 --> 00:03:56,501
They are fattening us up
so they can eat us.

61
00:03:56,669 --> 00:03:57,829
They're right outside!

62
00:03:58,004 --> 00:04:02,498
Finally, after all these years!
That's what I've been waiting to hear.

63
00:04:02,675 --> 00:04:04,506
"Reggie was right."

64
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:07,373
Now I don't want to go toot
my own horn, but toot-toot!

65
00:04:07,547 --> 00:04:10,209
Okay, now, here's the plan.
When they open the doors,

66
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:11,782
we run for the hills.

67
00:04:11,951 --> 00:04:13,350
Go, team!

68
00:04:14,954 --> 00:04:16,353
Give them Reggie!

69
00:04:17,056 --> 00:04:19,388
- What?
- Yeah! Give them Reggie!

70
00:04:19,559 --> 00:04:20,753
He's the Anticorn!

71
00:04:20,927 --> 00:04:22,622
Whoa, whoa!
You got it all wrong!

72
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,524
Let's give them Reggie.
Sacrifice him.

73
00:04:24,697 --> 00:04:26,426
We gotta stick together on this!

74
00:04:31,971 --> 00:04:33,461
See you later, Reggie!

75
00:04:34,641 --> 00:04:38,805
<i>So after all that, I was about</i>
<i>to become Thanksgiving dinner.</i>

76
00:04:38,978 --> 00:04:40,878
- No, no! Please! I beg you!
- We are all clear.

77
00:04:41,047 --> 00:04:42,408
- No! Ah!
<i>- Ladies and Gentlemen...</i>

78
00:04:42,448 --> 00:04:44,009
<i> the President of the United States.</i>

79
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,642
Thank you all for being here today.

80
00:04:45,818 --> 00:04:48,082
<i>- Or was I?</i>
- ...and to this humble family farm

81
00:04:48,321 --> 00:04:50,619
for one of my favorite
presidential traditions.

82
00:04:50,790 --> 00:04:53,657
The pardoning
of the Thanksgiving Turkey.

83
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:58,092
Only one special bird will be spared
from this terrible, yet delicious fate.

84
00:04:58,264 --> 00:05:02,166
Daddy! Daddy, it's this one.
This is the one I want right here.

85
00:05:02,335 --> 00:05:06,169
Sweetheart, I think we're gonna go
with a bigger turkey, okay?

86
00:05:06,339 --> 00:05:08,136
Please? Please, please,
please, please!

87
00:05:08,308 --> 00:05:09,570
- Sweetheart, I love you.
- Please! Please!

88
00:05:09,742 --> 00:05:11,175
That turkey's not big enough.

89
00:05:11,678 --> 00:05:13,475
Now, now don't do that.

90
00:05:13,646 --> 00:05:14,635
No, no, no.

91
00:05:20,953 --> 00:05:25,083
This is your pardoned turkey.
Happy Thanksgiving, little fella.

92
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:29,853
Come on, birdie, let's go.
We're going to the helicopter.

93
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,428
And right over there is a fence.
And that's a seagull.

94
00:05:32,598 --> 00:05:34,429
And there's a cow and a chicken.

95
00:05:34,767 --> 00:05:36,496
And that's Paul.
He's getting a divorce.

96
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:38,531
Yay!

97
00:05:38,705 --> 00:05:42,141
That's a bald guy and that's the girl
who likes my daddy.

98
00:05:42,308 --> 00:05:43,605
But don't tell anyone.

99
00:05:53,986 --> 00:05:55,715
Birdie...

100
00:05:57,156 --> 00:05:59,647
don't worry, you're safe.

101
00:06:01,961 --> 00:06:04,395
You're the pardoned turkey.

102
00:06:04,564 --> 00:06:06,794
I'm tired now.

103
00:06:15,174 --> 00:06:17,369
I'm the pardoned turkey.

104
00:06:18,311 --> 00:06:21,212
I'm the pardoned turkey!
I'm gonna live!

105
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:23,474
I'm gonna live,
I'm the pardoned turkey!

106
00:06:23,649 --> 00:06:25,981
This is blowing my mind!

107
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,050
<i>Turns out my life wasn't over</i>

108
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,817
<i>and a whole new life was just beginning.</i>

109
00:06:38,097 --> 00:06:39,826
Turkey, turkey, turkey.

110
00:06:39,999 --> 00:06:42,433
This is your new home, turkey.

111
00:06:43,069 --> 00:06:45,936
Mr. President, you have returned
to Camp David.

112
00:06:46,105 --> 00:06:48,665
That's General Sagan.
He's got issues.

113
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:53,403
That's Marcia.
She eats her feelings.

114
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:55,513
We're gonna have so much fun.

115
00:06:55,681 --> 00:06:59,014
I promise, I will never, ever leave you.

116
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,345
Oh, wait, TV!

117
00:07:04,557 --> 00:07:06,047
I'm tired now.

118
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:14,191
Ah! Oh! Ah!

119
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,740
<i>Previously on</i> Mundo del Amor...

120
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:24,877
What is this?

<i>One-eyed</i>

123
00:07:31,317 --> 00:07:32,909
They threw him out, too.

124
00:07:33,920 --> 00:07:36,047
I know exactly how that feels.

125
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:39,780
<i>Rejected by all, Alejandro</i>
<i>lives alone in the streets of Tijuana.</i>

- <i>Do you need to eat right now?</i>
- I do!

131
00:07:50,903 --> 00:07:53,838
- <i>Well, we can save the day with pizza!</i>
- Yes!

132
00:07:54,006 --> 00:07:56,440
That looks way better than corn.

<i> TV, and all the pizza I could eat.</i>

<i>or is he destined to be alone forever?</i>

150

Sounds like a pretty good
destiny to me, Alejandro.

151
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,768
<i>Find out on the next</i>
Mundo del Amor.

152
00:09:30,937 --> 00:09:35,431
This is your destiny.

Oh...

154
00:09:45,651 --> 00:09:48,415
Whatever you do,
do not make a sound.

155
00:09:53,593 --> 00:09:55,254
Sh...

156
00:09:55,428 --> 00:09:59,194
I'm Jake from the TFF.
That's Turkey Freedom Front.

157
00:09:59,365 --> 00:10:02,698
You've just been recruited
for a top secret mission.

158
00:10:03,803 --> 00:10:07,466
Ah! Help! I'm being kidnapped
by a wild turkey!

159
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,108
Security! Set Tasers to kill!

160
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,265
Ah!

161
00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,806
What was that?

162
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:23,589
- Oh!
- Love your enthusiasm, comrade.

163
00:10:23,756 --> 00:10:24,882
Dah!

164
00:10:25,057 --> 00:10:26,388
But you're running
in the wrong direction.

165
00:10:26,559 --> 00:10:28,550
Besides, we're already
behind schedule.

166
00:10:28,694 --> 00:10:31,219
- We're behind schedule?
- We are?

167
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,388
Why didn't you say so?
Let's move!

168
00:10:33,566 --> 00:10:36,592
Look, I think you have me
confused with somebody else.

169
00:10:36,769 --> 00:10:38,737
I'm not part of any mission.

170
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,602
Horizon seems clear.

171
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:45,800
- Hold on.
- Hey, wait!

172
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:48,173
It's me, the pardoned turkey.
Help me!

173
00:10:48,347 --> 00:10:51,009
A strange rogue turkey.
Stay back. I'll take him out.

174
00:10:51,851 --> 00:10:52,681
Ah!

175
00:10:52,852 --> 00:10:54,376
- Please don't hurt me.
- I don't know who you are

176
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,851
but you're seriously
jeopardizing this operation.

177
00:10:57,023 --> 00:10:58,456
Are you insane? It's me.

178
00:10:59,325 --> 00:11:01,793
Is it? Is it really?

179
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:02,950
Would you get off me?!

180
00:11:05,931 --> 00:11:08,092
You know what? I'm sick of you
throwing me around.

181
00:11:09,802 --> 00:11:11,133
You see this line?

182
00:11:11,303 --> 00:11:13,669
Do not come into my personal...

183
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:16,435
Did you not see the line?

184
00:11:16,609 --> 00:11:18,440
'Cause I was pretty clear
that it's right...

185
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:20,306
Snap out of it, Reggie.

186
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,447
Wait, how do you know my name?

187
00:11:22,615 --> 00:11:25,948
Because he told me
everything about you.

188
00:11:26,118 --> 00:11:27,983
He? Who is he?

189
00:11:28,154 --> 00:11:31,817
The Great Turkey.
He appeared in the sky

190
00:11:31,991 --> 00:11:36,553
on a bright ball of light with a voice
that came from everywhere.

191
00:11:36,729 --> 00:11:40,563
He gave me my mission,
told me I needed to find you.

192
00:11:40,733 --> 00:11:43,964
And then, he gave me this.

193
00:11:46,772 --> 00:11:47,898
A door knob?

194
00:11:48,074 --> 00:11:51,134
The sacred time knob.

195
00:11:52,478 --> 00:11:55,208
This guy is a lunatic. Oh!

196
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,713
That secret military base
should be right up ahead.

197
00:12:00,586 --> 00:12:02,076
The facility should be in here.

198
00:12:02,254 --> 00:12:05,917
Just need to figure out how to get
past this impenetrable gate.

199
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:12,761
So, this is what it looks like
on the inside.

200
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:16,333
Okay, what's inside
this secret base, anyway?

201
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,937
A time machine.

202
00:12:22,074 --> 00:12:23,166
A time machine?

203
00:12:23,342 --> 00:12:25,708
A time machine.

204
00:12:25,878 --> 00:12:27,812
- A time machine.
- A time...

205
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,243
What?! Who told you that?

206
00:12:30,416 --> 00:12:31,906
You did, just now.

207
00:12:32,084 --> 00:12:33,984
Of course I did. I was testing you.

208
00:12:34,453 --> 00:12:36,353
- Uh...
- That's our mission.

209
00:12:36,522 --> 00:12:40,618
Not to save ten turkeys
or even a hundred, but all of them.

210
00:12:40,793 --> 00:12:44,854
We're going back in time
to the first Thanksgiving

211
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:48,090
to get turkeys off the menu.

212
00:12:49,235 --> 00:12:51,965
That's right,
we're going back in time

213
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:56,632
to the first Thanksgiving
to get turkeys off the menu.

214
00:12:59,545 --> 00:13:02,207
- Who are you talking to?
- This guy right here.

215
00:13:03,415 --> 00:13:06,475
He totally gets it.
Look, look, see how he's nodding?

216
00:13:07,853 --> 00:13:11,584
Hello, soldier, welcome
to the Turkey Freedom Front.

217
00:13:11,757 --> 00:13:14,555
I'm just gonna let you two
get acquainted. Oh!

218
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,398
- Scanning area.
- What are you doing?

219
00:13:26,272 --> 00:13:28,172
- Not binoculars.
- Wait!

220
00:13:28,340 --> 00:13:30,900
- There's our target. Let's go!
- Ah!

221
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:40,311
Entering time module.

222
00:13:40,486 --> 00:13:44,923
Stand back.
Initiating launch sequence.

223
00:13:45,090 --> 00:13:47,854
Tingling sensation in lower body.

224
00:13:48,027 --> 00:13:50,427
Blood pressure rising, rapidly...

225
00:13:50,763 --> 00:13:54,255
penetrating space-time continuum.

226
00:13:54,433 --> 00:13:57,994
I can feel time warping!

227
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:06,802
Ooh! We can warp to another time
and maintain their lawns.

228
00:14:06,979 --> 00:14:08,708
This doesn't make sense.

229
00:14:08,881 --> 00:14:10,109
Oh, oh, look.

230
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:12,807
Potting soil from the year 3000.

231
00:14:12,985 --> 00:14:13,815
Ooh.

232
00:14:15,955 --> 00:14:17,650
- Oh, Jake, look!
- What? What is it?

233
00:14:18,490 --> 00:14:21,948
Future paint. Secret basecoat.

234
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,194
But, he said it would be here.

235
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,056
What the heck are you talking about?

236
00:14:28,634 --> 00:14:30,659
I don't know who your friend is

237
00:14:30,836 --> 00:14:33,134
but you guys should start
the Idiot Freedom Front

238
00:14:33,339 --> 00:14:35,500
and free yourselves from stupidity.

239
00:14:35,674 --> 00:14:38,370
There's no secret base
and there's definitely no time...

240
00:14:38,544 --> 00:14:40,307
machine?

241
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:45,873
Ah!

242
00:14:50,489 --> 00:14:53,049
Ha!

243
00:14:53,225 --> 00:14:55,716
Ah! Yeah!

244
00:14:58,097 --> 00:14:59,086
Ah!

245
00:15:02,768 --> 00:15:04,360
A-ha!

246
00:15:07,740 --> 00:15:08,729
Let's go.

247
00:15:12,711 --> 00:15:16,340
Hey, just because I'm following you
does not mean I am following you.

248
00:15:20,853 --> 00:15:22,047
Follow me.

249
00:15:22,221 --> 00:15:23,620
Did you not hear what I said?

250
00:15:23,789 --> 00:15:25,689
I'm not following you!

251
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:26,586
There's just no other way...

252
00:15:26,759 --> 00:15:28,590
- Ah! No!
- Ah!

253
00:15:30,396 --> 00:15:32,557
<i>Decontamination complete.</i>

254
00:15:33,732 --> 00:15:36,360
- What is that?
- Ow! It's a map, you idiot.

255
00:15:36,535 --> 00:15:39,026
A map! Will it lead us
to the time machine?

256
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:41,934
They aren't just gonna write
time machine on the...

257
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:44,598
- Oh, man.
- Where is it?

258
00:15:44,777 --> 00:15:46,244
It's, uh...

259
00:15:46,412 --> 00:15:49,108
Oh, we follow the blue line.

260
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:51,644
The blue line, of course!

261
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:53,978
Of course.
We'll both follow the blue line

262
00:15:54,153 --> 00:15:56,815
and get to the time machine
and stop Thanksgiving.

263
00:16:00,326 --> 00:16:01,953
Welcome to the team.

264
00:16:02,161 --> 00:16:04,891
Like two pieces of twine
woven together,

265
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:08,396
we are a strong and beautiful braid.

266
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:16,931
Yeah, if we're gonna do this,
you're gonna have to stop being weird.

267
00:16:26,452 --> 00:16:27,510
Ten-hut!

268
00:16:29,788 --> 00:16:31,629
You don't have to touch me
when you talk to me.

269
00:16:31,790 --> 00:16:33,655
Okay, don't touch me, in fact.

270
00:16:38,330 --> 00:16:40,195
Whoa!

271
00:16:40,366 --> 00:16:41,333
Enemy approaching!

272
00:16:41,500 --> 00:16:42,762
What are you doing?

273
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:46,366
They almost got us.

274
00:16:46,538 --> 00:16:48,836
Us? They almost got you!

275
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:52,808
We are not an "us".
I'm a flock of one.

276
00:16:52,978 --> 00:16:56,539
I'm a lone wolf, <i>ese.</i>
<i>El Solo Lobo.</i>

277
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:04,189
Witness the awesome power
of the pardoned turkey.

278
00:17:04,356 --> 00:17:05,345
Get back!

279
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:08,022
Hey, guys, Reggie here.

280
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,218
I don't even recognize you.
You guys must be new.

281
00:17:10,396 --> 00:17:13,024
You guys are never gonna believe
what I've been through.

282
00:17:15,634 --> 00:17:18,398
- Should we report this?
- Too much paperwork.

283
00:17:18,570 --> 00:17:21,232
- Let's roast him.
- Copy that.

284
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:38,152
Chrononaut One, are you ready

285
00:17:38,323 --> 00:17:40,848
to be the first human being
to travel through time?

286
00:17:41,026 --> 00:17:42,493
Yes, sir!

287
00:17:42,661 --> 00:17:45,653
He'd better be. The chances
of survival are almost zero.

288
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,111
Wait, you never said anything...

289
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:50,929
That's on a need to know basis, sir.

290
00:17:54,206 --> 00:17:55,833
Why are they trying to kill me?

291
00:17:56,942 --> 00:17:59,342
Huh, I just want to go back
to being a pardoned turkey.

292
00:17:59,912 --> 00:18:03,109
I had slippers. Slippers.
What are you doing?

293
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:06,115
I've got this completely under control.

294
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:08,219
Are you crazy?
You've had nothing under...

295
00:18:09,955 --> 00:18:12,014
It's an old TFF trick.

296
00:18:13,358 --> 00:18:15,724
It's called sound diversion.

297
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:34,803
Are you kidding me?

298
00:18:42,521 --> 00:18:44,819
Control, we have a contaminant
in Chamber 47.

299
00:18:44,990 --> 00:18:46,321
Copy that. What type, Agent?

300
00:18:46,492 --> 00:18:48,050
Uh, a turkey, sir.

301
00:18:48,293 --> 00:18:49,487
That is very weird, Agent.

302
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:51,595
Copy that.
How do we address it, sir?

303
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:54,664
Uh, with cranberry sauce.

304
00:18:59,505 --> 00:19:01,803
Funny, right?

305
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:03,974
But seriously, we should deal
with the contaminant.

306
00:19:04,109 --> 00:19:06,976
Copy that. All units report to Level H.

307
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,507
<i>Exterminate with extreme prejudice.</i>

308
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,246
Go, go, go!

309
00:19:15,387 --> 00:19:17,446
Mr. President,
once the countdown starts,

310
00:19:17,623 --> 00:19:19,250
we will not be able to stop it.

311
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:20,550
Understood, General.

312
00:19:22,427 --> 00:19:24,918
<i>T-minus three</i>
<i>minutes and counting.</i>

313
00:19:29,935 --> 00:19:31,027
- There they are.
- Ah!

314
00:19:41,513 --> 00:19:42,502
Ah!

315
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:04,634
There's no way
I'm going near that thing.

316
00:20:04,803 --> 00:20:08,330
Reggie, this is our destiny!

317
00:20:08,507 --> 00:20:12,375
My destiny has pizza
and TV On Demand!

318
00:20:14,012 --> 00:20:16,003
Ah!

319
00:20:17,983 --> 00:20:19,416
<i>Contamination detected.</i>

320
00:20:19,585 --> 00:20:20,916
Freeze that image, soldier!

321
00:20:22,988 --> 00:20:25,354
- What's the problem?
- Turkeys, sir.

322
00:20:25,524 --> 00:20:27,822
Chrononaut One,
get out of there now!

323
00:20:27,993 --> 00:20:30,018
Oh, thank you, thank you.

324
00:20:36,001 --> 00:20:37,696
Help me, help me,
please help me!

325
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:43,900
Wait, wait, wait, wait! Ah!

326
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:45,668
<i>New chrononaut detected.</i>

327
00:20:45,844 --> 00:20:47,778
<i>Engaging posterior restraint system.</i>

328

<i>Setting, supple.</i>

329
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:54,241
No, no, no, no!

330
00:21:02,561 --> 00:21:04,620
Help me!

331
00:21:05,063 --> 00:21:08,464
- I am not going out there.
- I'm not going out there.

332
00:21:08,634 --> 00:21:10,534
- I'm definitely...
- Sorry, bro.

333
00:21:10,702 --> 00:21:14,604
- Two weeks from retirement.
- Good luck!

334
00:21:15,907 --> 00:21:16,805
Ow! My foot!

335
00:21:16,975 --> 00:21:20,934
Oh...

336
00:21:21,113 --> 00:21:22,102
Ah!

337
00:21:40,632 --> 00:21:43,624
Huh? What's going on? Help! Ah!

338
00:21:50,575 --> 00:21:52,907
- Help me! Please take my hand!
- Calm down.

339
00:21:53,078 --> 00:21:55,672
Get me out!

340
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:57,908
Ah!

341
00:22:24,876 --> 00:22:27,709

Obviously. Now, take us
to the first Thanksgiving.

351
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:17,388
- <i>Destination, set.</i>
- No, no, no!

352
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:21,692
<i>Activating Chrononaut safety bubble</i>
<i>to shield from possible side effects.</i>

353
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:23,993
Side effects? What side effects?

354
00:23:31,176 --> 00:23:34,009
<i>Side-effects may include</i>
<i>accelerated aging...</i>

355
00:23:34,146 --> 00:23:35,511
I'm cold.

356
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:37,443
<i>Rapid evolutionary regressions.</i>

357
00:23:37,616 --> 00:23:42,110
<i>Erratic physical mutation</i>
<i>into an adorable baby dragon.</i>

358
00:23:42,287 --> 00:23:46,917
<i>Or an octopus, a king crab,</i>
<i>a pony, the sasquatch.</i>

359
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:47,922
Ah!

360
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:50,687
<i>I hope you've enjoyed</i>
<i>your time travel experience.</i>

361
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,524
- Ow...
- <i>Please hold on for re-entry.</i>

362
00:23:55,634 --> 00:23:58,467
- Oh-ah-ah!
- Whoo-hoo!

363
00:24:05,777 --> 00:24:06,903
Oh... Oh, boy.

364
00:24:07,078 --> 00:24:10,275
<i>Welcome to Plymouth Colony, 1621.</i>

365
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,576
<i>Three days before</i>
<i>the first Thanksgiving.</i>

366
00:24:19,891 --> 00:24:23,383
We did it! We went back in time.

367
00:24:24,062 --> 00:24:26,758
Reggie, come out here.
You're gonna love this!

368
00:24:26,932 --> 00:24:28,160
Sure, why not.

369
00:24:31,069 --> 00:24:32,434
Ow!

370
00:24:32,604 --> 00:24:34,663
Ah! It even smells old.

371
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:37,172
<i>May I recommend some light stretching.</i>

372
00:24:37,342 --> 00:24:38,400
Great idea, S.T.E.V. E...

373
00:24:38,577 --> 00:24:40,841
Pecs, glutes, pecs, glutes, pecs,

374
00:24:41,012 --> 00:24:42,673
glutes, pecs, glutes, pecs, glutes.

375
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:44,907
- Ew!
- Pec, pec, glute, glute.

376
00:24:47,118 --> 00:24:50,349
Whoo! Ah! Let's go, Reggie.

377
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:52,422
<i>Activating security cloaking</i>

378
00:24:52,491 --> 00:24:54,516
<i>mechanism during solar recharge.</i>

379
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:56,259
Wait, no, S.T.E.V.E.!

380
00:25:00,765 --> 00:25:02,665
S.T.E.V.E.! S.T.E.V.E.!

381
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:05,826
<i>S. T.E. V.E.?</i>
<i>S. T.E. V.E. 's not here, man.</i>

382
00:25:06,004 --> 00:25:08,871
I'm laughing,
but that's not funny, S.T.E.V. E...

383
00:25:09,040 --> 00:25:12,032
<i>This conversation is taxing</i>
<i>my power reserves.</i>

384
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:15,373
- <i>Shutting down.</i>
- What? No! No, no, no, no!

385
00:25:15,547 --> 00:25:19,039
Reggie, south is this way.
Sun rises in the north.

386
00:25:21,286 --> 00:25:24,278
Wait, I can't stay out here
back in the food chain.

387
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,724
<i>Finally, some me time.</i>

388
00:25:27,893 --> 00:25:30,361
I've reconned the area.
We are all alone.

389
00:25:30,529 --> 00:25:33,623
This is a bad idea.
This is a real wild forest.

390
00:25:33,798 --> 00:25:36,062
It's probably full of crazy,
bloodthirsty monsters.

391
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:38,668
If anything happens to me,
it's on your head.

392
00:25:38,837 --> 00:25:42,432
Trust me, we're perfectly safe.

393
00:26:04,563 --> 00:26:05,860
Ah!

394
00:26:06,031 --> 00:26:08,124
Jake, Jake! Oh, no, no!

395
00:26:08,567 --> 00:26:11,001
Ah!

396
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:15,003
No, just... Another one!
Please, please I beg you.

397
00:26:15,173 --> 00:26:16,367
Please don't eat me.

398
00:26:16,541 --> 00:26:20,068
- End of the line for you.
- I'm dead, I'm dead!

399
00:26:20,845 --> 00:26:22,244
Ohhh!

400
00:26:35,460 --> 00:26:37,519
- Hi.
- Hello.

401
00:26:37,696 --> 00:26:40,460
- Is this Turkey Paradise?
- Sh!

402
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:42,862
- See anything?
- Nothing here!

403
00:26:43,034 --> 00:26:45,525
Oh, we lost them again,
Captain Standish.

404
00:26:45,704 --> 00:26:48,172
I can see that. Now keep looking!

405
00:26:48,373 --> 00:26:49,362
Yes, sir!

406
00:26:49,541 --> 00:26:52,533
They're here.
Oh, I can feel it.

407
00:26:56,047 --> 00:26:59,210
Hello, Turkeys of ye olde time.

408
00:26:59,384 --> 00:27:03,878
We've come from the future in a time
machine named S.T.E.V.E. To save you...

409
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:06,615
Quiet! We were leading the hunters
away from our nest

410
00:27:06,791 --> 00:27:10,420
till you came along shrieking
like terrified hens. Who are you?

411
00:27:10,595 --> 00:27:14,964
- Yeah, you tell them, Ranger.
- Right, Furley? Whoo!

412
00:27:17,636 --> 00:27:21,732
Don't leave me hanging, Ranger.
Furley's right there. He looks up to me.

413
00:27:25,243 --> 00:27:26,923
The hunters are returning.
We need to move.

414
00:27:27,212 --> 00:27:29,976
I have the lead.
Everyone follow me.

415
00:27:30,148 --> 00:27:32,139
- Hm!
- He has the lead?

416
00:27:43,094 --> 00:27:46,586
- Stay in formation.
- In formation, stay!

417
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:52,930
This is really dangerous!

418
00:27:53,104 --> 00:27:55,470
Ah! Ah! Ah!

419
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,198
- Hold on.
- Oh, boy.

420
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:59,434
This is a fast paced day.
I love it though.

421
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:01,306
We should catch up with the others.

422
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:03,344
Wait!

423
00:28:03,515 --> 00:28:06,177
Just ate, that's the only thing
holding me back. How you doing?

424
00:28:09,387 --> 00:28:10,649
Ow!

425
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:13,215
- Come on!
- Ah!

426
00:28:19,531 --> 00:28:21,158
Whoa!

427
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:23,630
My name's Reggie, by the way.
I'm a Pisces.

428
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,532
I'm Jenny. I'm running for my life.

429
00:28:30,975 --> 00:28:32,533
Round them up, boys!

430
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:36,475
Everyone, this way.

431
00:28:36,648 --> 00:28:38,479
This way, everyone.

432
00:28:41,519 --> 00:28:42,747
There they are!

433
00:28:43,588 --> 00:28:44,555
Quick!

434
00:28:46,491 --> 00:28:47,856
- Oof!
- Furley!

435
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:51,362
Gotcha.

436
00:28:53,598 --> 00:28:57,193
Yah!
Out of the way!

437
00:28:59,003 --> 00:29:01,062
- Come on, come on, come on!
- Gah-yah!

438
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,232
Come here, you!

439
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:11,341
Whoa! Sh!

440
00:29:16,921 --> 00:29:17,910
Whoa. Come on.

441
00:29:21,392 --> 00:29:23,417
- Okay, he's leaving.
- Great.

442
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:25,563
So, what's a Pisces?

443
00:29:25,730 --> 00:29:27,061
Oh, wow.

444
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:29,723
Is everything okay?

445
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:32,028
I don't know. Is it?

446
00:29:32,203 --> 00:29:34,501
Oh, I fell out of the nest
when I was a baby.

447
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:37,186
- Oh! So, that's why your eye is...
- What's wrong with my eye?

448
00:29:39,444 --> 00:29:42,538
I'm just kidding.
Whenever I get nervous, it goes...

449
00:29:49,721 --> 00:29:51,712
There! Now there's just one of you.

450
00:29:51,890 --> 00:29:53,721
Ranger, what should we do now?

451
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:55,985
We should return home
and report what happened.

452
00:29:56,161 --> 00:30:00,655
No. We should attack the fort
and free your captured comrades.

453
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,322
Furley and Amos are my friends,

454
00:30:02,500 --> 00:30:04,559
but we cannot risk the safety
of the flock.

455
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:07,671
Then I'll go myself
if you lack the courage.

456
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,932
- Oh!
- Courage?

457
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:11,939
Oh...

458
00:30:12,110 --> 00:30:13,805
I'll show you courage!

459
00:30:16,681 --> 00:30:19,013
Yeah!

460
00:30:40,104 --> 00:30:41,196
Harsh.

461
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:47,801
Enough with your impressive
and very gross display.

462
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:49,173
Let's just get back home.

463
00:30:49,848 --> 00:30:51,372
Oh!

464
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:54,279
- Wow.
- It's all about confidence.

465
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:55,885
Ow!

466
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:01,351
Bradford! Come out here!

467
00:31:03,027 --> 00:31:05,188
Get out here! Governor Bradford!

468
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:08,799
Please, gentlemen, please.
Settle down, all right?

469
00:31:08,933 --> 00:31:11,993
- You guys act like you're starving.
- We are starving!

470
00:31:12,170 --> 00:31:14,297
We want the food in storage!

471
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:20,338
We have talked about this.
That food is for the coming feast

472
00:31:20,511 --> 00:31:24,311
- with the Wampanoag Indians.
- But we're hungry now!

473
00:31:24,482 --> 00:31:27,178
- We're all hungry.
- You don't look hungry!

474
00:31:27,352 --> 00:31:29,980
I've got a hypothyroid issue.

475
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,324
Now as you know,
we have not stored enough food

476
00:31:34,492 --> 00:31:35,424
to see us through the winter.

477
00:31:35,593 --> 00:31:38,892
See that hill? That's last winter.

478
00:31:39,063 --> 00:31:43,193
That will be all of us, if we do not
become friends with the Indians.

479
00:31:43,368 --> 00:31:46,360
We need their help. Without it,
we will not survive, all right?

480
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:48,937
Oh! Ha...

481
00:31:51,175 --> 00:31:53,200
Oh!

482
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:55,846
Three days, that's it.
I promise.

483
00:31:56,014 --> 00:31:57,743
- You can all hold out.
- Yes!

484
00:31:57,916 --> 00:32:02,319
Governor Bradford is right.
We can all hold out...

485
00:32:05,523 --> 00:32:06,581
Except for Clancy.

486
00:32:06,758 --> 00:32:09,386
But he was sick on the boat,
so that's not on me.

487
00:32:09,560 --> 00:32:12,586
- We want that food in storage.
- Give us them keys!

488
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:13,731
Mummy!

489
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:16,128
Standish has returned!

490
00:32:20,538 --> 00:32:23,098
Standish!

491
00:32:23,274 --> 00:32:24,571
Myles, you've returned!

492
00:32:24,742 --> 00:32:26,107
Hi!

493
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:27,769
Ha-ha!

494
00:32:27,946 --> 00:32:32,406
Did I tell you I was gonna provide food
for ye, yes I did, didn't I?

495
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:34,813
Ha! You call that a bounty?

496
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:42,353
Standish, the people want my head.

497
00:32:42,560 --> 00:32:45,552
And if we do not have the feast,
I'm afraid they will take it.

498
00:32:45,730 --> 00:32:47,288
We need food. Anything at this point.

499
00:32:47,465 --> 00:32:49,933
I said I would get you turkeys...

500
00:32:50,101 --> 00:32:51,329
Oh!

501
00:32:51,903 --> 00:32:54,997
and that's what you are going to get.

502
00:32:55,173 --> 00:32:57,767
Even more than you can eat.

503
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:01,572
Right, well, good chat.
Talk tomorrow.

504
00:33:02,914 --> 00:33:04,313
What a personality.

505
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:14,290
So, Alpha Turkey up there...

506
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:19,254
what's the story?
You two, um, rubbing wattles or...

507
00:33:19,664 --> 00:33:21,097
Ew! No, Ranger is my brother.

508
00:33:21,265 --> 00:33:22,926
Get inside!

509
00:33:23,101 --> 00:33:24,625
Inside, get!

510
00:33:24,802 --> 00:33:26,167
And you know, even if he wasn't...

511
00:33:26,337 --> 00:33:28,965
I'm looking for more mind
and less muscle.

512
00:33:29,140 --> 00:33:32,132
Really? Are you serious?
'Cause I have like almost no muscle.

513
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:34,538
Literally, I'm like nothing.

514
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:38,012
Maybe you should get that looked at.

515
00:33:47,525 --> 00:33:49,459
- After you.
- Whoa!

516
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:51,618
It's a tiny drop, I promise.

517
00:33:54,198 --> 00:33:55,825
Whoa!

518
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,560
Oh...

519
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:01,727
Glutes.

520
00:34:06,411 --> 00:34:09,073
So this is... everyone.

521
00:34:09,247 --> 00:34:12,307
An army in need of a commander.

522
00:34:12,483 --> 00:34:17,477
Wow, I've never seen so many turkeys
in one place actually doing things.

523
00:34:17,655 --> 00:34:18,815
I'm just shocked.

524
00:34:18,990 --> 00:34:22,892
So, in the future,
turkeys just sit around all day

525
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:24,685
eating and staring at the wall?

526
00:34:24,862 --> 00:34:28,320
Yes. I mean, no!
No, that would be...

527
00:34:28,499 --> 00:34:30,023
I mean, some do. No one I know.

528
00:34:30,201 --> 00:34:33,659
If we weren't doing things,
we'd become dumb.

529
00:34:33,838 --> 00:34:35,863
- Don't you think?
- Hm...

530
00:34:36,040 --> 00:34:38,201
- Hello, wild undomesticated
- Oh no.

531
00:34:38,342 --> 00:34:40,708
Simple turkeys from the distant past.

532
00:34:40,878 --> 00:34:45,247
I have brought you a gift,
and the gift is me. I am Jake.

533
00:34:45,416 --> 00:34:49,079
I have traveled
in a time machine named S.T.E.V.E.

534
00:34:49,253 --> 00:34:53,553
In order to stop Thanksgiving
and get turkeys off the menu!

535
00:34:54,725 --> 00:34:56,454
What's Thanksgiving?

536
00:34:56,627 --> 00:35:00,358
Yeah, that's right. It hasn't happened.
It's a feast of sorts.

537
00:35:00,531 --> 00:35:01,691
What's a menu?

538
00:35:01,866 --> 00:35:06,269
A menu, it's like a list of food items
in a restaurant.

539
00:35:06,437 --> 00:35:08,405
- What's a restaurant?
- That's not important.

540
00:35:08,573 --> 00:35:12,031
What's important is
that you stop asking me questions

541
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,735
and agree to follow me blindly!

542
00:35:15,480 --> 00:35:17,948
No!

543
00:35:19,984 --> 00:35:21,747
We will not fight.

544
00:35:23,754 --> 00:35:28,555
I am Broadbeak, leader of the flock.

545
00:35:28,693 --> 00:35:32,789
And this is Leatherbeak, high elder
and my most trusted advisor.

546
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:48,676
Huh! You...

547
00:35:49,147 --> 00:35:52,514
have traveled a great distance.

548
00:35:54,385 --> 00:35:55,579
You...

549
00:35:55,753 --> 00:35:57,618
Hm...

550
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:00,123
and your lovely wife.

551
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:03,692
She's beautiful, so soft and feminine.

552
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:11,257
Father, this is Jake and Reggie.
They're from the future, apparently.

553
00:36:11,435 --> 00:36:14,268
Father?

554
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:16,338
Please, walk with me.

555
00:36:21,078 --> 00:36:24,377
Jake, you speak with deep conviction.

556
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:29,145
- Well, I can speak even...
- Deeper if you like.

557
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:32,118
We did not always live underground.

558
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:35,885
We lived above in the trees,
but then the settlers came...

559
00:36:36,294 --> 00:36:38,057
and we were forced into hiding.

560
00:36:38,396 --> 00:36:41,456
But we were safe and over time,

561
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:46,627
we turned what we thought our prison,
into our home.

562
00:36:50,741 --> 00:36:52,936
I understand, sir, but...

563
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:57,137
The Great Turkey told me
what I must do.

564
00:37:00,418 --> 00:37:02,045
I know, "The Great Turkey,"
terrible name

565
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:03,653
for an imaginary friend, right?

566
00:37:04,589 --> 00:37:06,489
It is my destiny.

567
00:37:07,491 --> 00:37:11,222
Well, Jake, let me show you our destiny.

568
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:16,724
Careful.

569
00:37:16,901 --> 00:37:18,835
This is our future.

570
00:37:22,106 --> 00:37:25,200
Our destiny lies with them.

571
00:37:29,080 --> 00:37:31,548
You are welcome to stay
as long as you like

572
00:37:31,749 --> 00:37:34,741
but as long as you are here,
you will respect our ways.

573
00:37:35,620 --> 00:37:38,453
We do not fight. We defend.

574
00:37:38,623 --> 00:37:41,456
We protect and we survive.

575
00:37:41,626 --> 00:37:42,854
Yes, sir.

576
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:48,198
Oh, Reggie, look. Here.

577
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:51,868
- Just hold it like this.
- Whoa, whoa!

578
00:37:52,036 --> 00:37:54,504
I'm not really the baby holding type.

579
00:37:54,705 --> 00:37:57,572
It's easy. Even a super advanced
future turkey can do it.

580
00:38:06,851 --> 00:38:09,752
Oh, she wants you to throw up
some worms into her mouth.

581
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:12,783
What girl wouldn't?

582
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:17,126
Oh, that's sweet and disgusting.

583
00:38:21,332 --> 00:38:22,299
I think she likes me.

584
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,457
Yeah, maybe she does.

585
00:38:24,635 --> 00:38:27,900
Oh, almost fell.
Hey, hey, hey.

586
00:38:28,072 --> 00:38:31,337
Hey, you ticklish?
You ticklish? Ah!

587
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:35,242
Ho!

588
00:38:40,584 --> 00:38:43,985
Well, good night,
Reggie from the future.

589
00:38:44,155 --> 00:38:47,682
Good night, Jenny from my dreams.

590
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:57,464
What? What, you want some worms?
I'm not gonna do it, it's disgusting.

591
00:38:58,869 --> 00:39:00,131
Mama?

592
00:39:01,872 --> 00:39:05,000
- Oh, my stomach's aching.
- Mine, too.

593
00:39:05,176 --> 00:39:08,043
This is it, my friend.
The end.

594
00:39:08,779 --> 00:39:11,612
<i>El final,</i>
unless we figure a way out.

595
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:16,618
You got something?

596
00:39:17,288 --> 00:39:21,122
Yes, Furley, I knew your big freaking
<i>cabeza</i> was good for something!

597
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,296
Furley, that's a flying pony.

598
00:39:26,530 --> 00:39:27,851
Two birds and a handful of grain.

599
00:39:28,866 --> 00:39:31,801
This feast will be more of a fast
at the rate we're going.

600
00:39:31,969 --> 00:39:34,904
Makes you wonder if Captain Standish
is losing his edge.

601
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:37,905
You were wondering what?

602
00:39:38,476 --> 00:39:41,070
Uh... Nothing, Captain.

603
00:39:41,245 --> 00:39:43,645
The problem with you boys is

604
00:39:43,814 --> 00:39:46,806
you're thinking about
where them turkeys are...

605
00:39:47,985 --> 00:39:50,476
and not where they ain't.

606
00:39:50,921 --> 00:39:53,856
This is where we got them last two.

607
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:57,016
They're leading us away
from something.

608
00:39:57,194 --> 00:39:59,389
Something they're protecting.

609
00:39:59,563 --> 00:40:03,158
You're saying they're doing it
on purpose? Like they're smart.

610
00:40:04,769 --> 00:40:08,728
I've hunted everything that's walked,
crawled or flown

611
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,931
and I always get me quarry.

612
00:40:11,108 --> 00:40:13,872
These turkeys,
they're up to something.

613
00:40:14,044 --> 00:40:18,071
So tomorrow,
we start off in this direction

614
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:23,687
and we don't stop looking till we get
every bleeding last one of them!

615
00:40:26,056 --> 00:40:28,217
Oh, that was me good map!

616
00:40:31,862 --> 00:40:33,762
Good morning, everyone.

617
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:36,695
Here are today's assignments.

618
00:40:37,201 --> 00:40:38,532
- Fanny!
- Danny.

619
00:40:38,702 --> 00:40:41,728
Danny, take your team
and lead the hunters east.

620
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:43,567
- West.
- Lead them west.

621
00:40:43,741 --> 00:40:45,038
You got it, brother.

622
00:40:45,576 --> 00:40:47,203
- Clancy...
- Nancy.

623
00:40:47,378 --> 00:40:49,710
Nancy, you do the same thing
in the north.

624
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:52,041
- South.
- In the south, yes.

625
00:40:53,384 --> 00:40:56,217
- Dusty...
- Justy. He's your son.

626
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:59,720
Correct, Justy, you go find another one
of your magical pinecones.

627
00:40:59,924 --> 00:41:02,893
Jes, jes, jes!
Meow, meow, meow.

628
00:41:03,494 --> 00:41:07,328
You had to marry a chicken.

629
00:41:07,498 --> 00:41:10,797
Jenny, you will spring
the hunter's traps. Take Reggie.

630
00:41:10,968 --> 00:41:11,900
Yes!

631
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:15,269
I said that out loud.

632
00:41:15,439 --> 00:41:18,465
Ranger, scout the fort.
See what they are planning.

633
00:41:18,642 --> 00:41:20,439
Bring Jake with you.

634
00:41:20,611 --> 00:41:24,775
Go! Be swift and be safe.

635
00:41:28,252 --> 00:41:31,415
Here are the assignments
for the day.

636
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,428
Just try to keep up,
and try not to get us killed.

637
00:41:38,596 --> 00:41:41,463
You're the one who's gonna have
to try to keep up. With me!

638
00:41:45,603 --> 00:41:49,004
His method is unconventional,
but very effective.

639
00:41:50,374 --> 00:41:53,832
- Two can play at that game!
- Ow!

640
00:41:59,383 --> 00:42:00,350
Ow...

641
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:03,385
I beat you to the bottom of the hill.

642
00:42:03,554 --> 00:42:05,146
Shut up.

643
00:42:07,157 --> 00:42:08,624
What are you looking at?

644
00:42:14,999 --> 00:42:16,296
Check the traps.

645
00:42:17,635 --> 00:42:19,865
We're always one step
ahead of him.

646
00:42:20,037 --> 00:42:21,299
Well, that's reassuring.

647
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:24,134
Which is one step away from...

648
00:42:24,341 --> 00:42:26,138
Well, that's less reassuring.

649
00:42:26,310 --> 00:42:30,041
But we follow father's rules.
He keeps the flock safe.

650
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:33,513
I love rules. I actually have a rule
about following rules.

651
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,845
- Me, too!
- No way! Kiss me.

652
00:42:36,020 --> 00:42:39,148
- What did you just say?
- I said rules rule!

653
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:41,848
No you didn't, but that's okay.

654
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,017
The traps are all set, sir.

655
00:42:47,831 --> 00:42:49,162
You ready to spring some traps?

656
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,528
Pfft! I was born...

657
00:42:51,702 --> 00:42:54,500
- Whoo-hoo!
...ready.

658
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:56,395
Okay.

659
00:43:00,411 --> 00:43:02,174
- Reggie?
- Oh!

660
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,047
Ahhh!

661
00:43:14,224 --> 00:43:17,523
Ow!

662
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:21,623
- That was incredible!
- I think I might need to lie down.

663
00:43:21,799 --> 00:43:23,460
So, tell me about the future.

664
00:43:23,634 --> 00:43:26,125
Tell me every little detail,
but make it very fast.

665
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:29,537
Really? You want to know
about the future?

666
00:43:30,741 --> 00:43:32,299
Ha! Whoa! Ah!

667
00:43:32,977 --> 00:43:34,257
- Stealth mode.
- I'm stealthier!

668
00:43:35,879 --> 00:43:36,868
- Mm!
- No, you're not.

669
00:43:39,516 --> 00:43:43,247
- Popeye dive.
- Whoo! Whoo!

670
00:43:45,990 --> 00:43:47,321
Psst!

671
00:44:00,104 --> 00:44:02,004
Mm!

672
00:44:20,524 --> 00:44:21,923
Mm... oh!

673
00:44:23,994 --> 00:44:25,188
Hm!

674
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:58,022
- Thank you, woodland creature.
- Never taken a lesson.

675
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,331
I always thought in the future

676
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:06,628
there would be harmony
between all living things,

677
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:09,466
but hey,
pizza and TV sound great.

678
00:45:09,807 --> 00:45:13,834
The best show is <i>Mundo del Amor.</i>
That's Spanish for "World of Love."

679
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:24,176
Reggie?

680
00:45:24,988 --> 00:45:26,683
Yes, Jenny?

681
00:45:27,658 --> 00:45:29,319
- Dogs.
- Dogs?

682
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:32,360
Yeah, I feel it, too.
Yeah, let's just be dogs.

683
00:45:32,529 --> 00:45:35,191
I'll be a boxer
and you just be a shiba-inu.

684
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:37,595
Dogs!

685
00:45:38,335 --> 00:45:39,529
Dogs?

686
00:45:39,703 --> 00:45:41,864
Something's wrong.
They shouldn't be this far north.

687
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:49,579
Wait, I know where we are. Come on!

688
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:52,545
Reggie, we can't go this way.
We'll lead them right to the flock.

689
00:45:52,716 --> 00:45:53,546
S.T.E.V.E.!

690
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:56,175
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
What is that?!

691
00:46:06,263 --> 00:46:07,890
Oh, Reggie.

692
00:46:10,768 --> 00:46:13,566
- Don't scream. Die with dignity.
- It's okay.

693
00:46:13,737 --> 00:46:14,897
Hm...

694
00:46:17,708 --> 00:46:19,300
What have we here?

695
00:46:25,249 --> 00:46:26,614
Go, S.T.E.V.E., go!

696
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:35,216
It's magic.

697
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:42,391
I'm gonna throw up
and not in the good way!

698
00:46:45,402 --> 00:46:47,597
<i>I believe that we are</i>
<i>at a safe distance.</i>

699
00:46:47,771 --> 00:46:50,672
What? Where are we?
What is that?

700
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:52,172
That's Earth.

701
00:46:53,677 --> 00:46:54,644
Earth?

702
00:46:57,948 --> 00:47:00,712
That's where we live.
Come on, trust me.

703
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:14,258
Whoa...

704
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:17,032
It's beautiful.

705
00:47:17,201 --> 00:47:18,429
It really is.

706
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:21,966
I always imagined
there was more out there,

707
00:47:22,139 --> 00:47:23,766
but never this much more.

708
00:47:30,647 --> 00:47:32,046
You really are from the future.

709
00:47:32,216 --> 00:47:33,444
You didn't believe me?

710
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:37,281
Of course not! I thought you were
insane and possibly dangerous.

711
00:47:39,122 --> 00:47:40,953
And cute.

712
00:47:41,124 --> 00:47:43,615
So, was it scary?
You know, traveling through time?

713
00:47:43,794 --> 00:47:46,888
Nah. Takes a lot to rattle
a turkey like me.

714
00:47:47,064 --> 00:47:48,793
Wish you could have seen it.

715
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:52,800
<i>Oh, she can.</i>
<i>Playback of time travel commencing.</i>

716
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:55,010
S.T.E.V.E. Must be experiencing
some kind of glitch.

717
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:57,471
<i>This is where Reggie cries</i>
<i>for his mommy.</i>

718
00:47:57,641 --> 00:47:58,835
Aw. That's sweet.

719
00:47:59,009 --> 00:48:02,240
- We're not sure why that turkey is...
- <i>Here it is in slow-mo.</i>

720
00:48:02,412 --> 00:48:05,404
All right, I think we're safe now.
We should really get going.

721
00:48:05,582 --> 00:48:06,571
<i>As you wish.</i>

722
00:48:17,027 --> 00:48:20,793
Whoa!

723
00:48:28,405 --> 00:48:30,999
Huh. Well, I didn't know a guy
could scream that high pitched.

724
00:48:31,174 --> 00:48:33,142
- Isn't that weird?
- He is so funny.

725
00:48:33,343 --> 00:48:35,783
Bye, S.T.E.V. E... You're the best
time machine I've ever met.

726
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:38,610
<i>Goodbye, Jenny.</i>
<i>Oh, Reggie...</i>

727
00:48:38,782 --> 00:48:42,047
<i>I'm fully charged and ready</i>
<i>to take you home.</i>

728
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:43,846
Are you serious?
We can go...

729
00:48:44,021 --> 00:48:46,615
Come on, Reggie, let's go.

730
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:52,184
Uh, yeah. You know, we don't want to go
flying off half-cocked, right?

731
00:48:52,362 --> 00:48:54,353
Keep me posted. As you were.

732
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,765
Ooh! Yeah.

733
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:05,237
- Get down.
- You get down.

734
00:49:09,146 --> 00:49:10,875
- Hm...
- Hm...

735
00:49:11,548 --> 00:49:15,416
Centerpieces.
Thanksgiving is happening tomorrow.

736
00:49:15,585 --> 00:49:17,212
The hunters are returning!

737
00:49:17,387 --> 00:49:20,618
If only we could see
what's inside that building.

738
00:49:22,292 --> 00:49:24,783
That's the weapons shed
where they keep all their boomsticks

739
00:49:24,962 --> 00:49:26,520
and the boom powder.

740
00:49:26,730 --> 00:49:30,393
Without their weapons,
they are weak and afraid.

741
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:34,263
A-ha!

742
00:49:34,438 --> 00:49:36,269
The majority of my powder's
dangerous.

743
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:40,069
We must report this feast
to father right away.

744
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:43,408
Jake? Jake!

745
00:49:45,682 --> 00:49:48,173
Oh! That was incredible.
I can't stop thinking about it.

746
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:52,413
Yeah, like I can't stop thinking,
hypothetically...

747
00:49:52,589 --> 00:49:53,817
Wait. Do you know
what that word means?

748
00:49:53,991 --> 00:49:56,755
No, but I can imagine a scenario
in which I might.

749
00:49:56,927 --> 00:49:59,259
It's all right, I'll tell you.

750
00:49:59,396 --> 00:50:01,364
- See what I did?
- Very clever.

751
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:03,192
Okay, so, hypothetically?

752
00:50:04,534 --> 00:50:06,559
Well, what if some fella...

753
00:50:06,770 --> 00:50:08,533
Just some fella?

754
00:50:09,706 --> 00:50:12,607
Well, a reasonably attractive,
quick-witted fella.

755
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:16,008
What if he was to offer
to take you to the future?

756
00:50:17,814 --> 00:50:20,374
I would love to see it.

757
00:50:24,021 --> 00:50:27,354
But my place is here
with my father and Ranger.

758
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:30,019
I could never leave the flock,

759
00:50:30,193 --> 00:50:32,218
especially not with the hunters
after us.

760
00:50:33,463 --> 00:50:34,943
What if the hunters weren't a threat?

761
00:50:35,065 --> 00:50:37,465
What if everybody was safe and happy
like before?

762
00:50:38,802 --> 00:50:39,860
That would be wonderful.

763
00:50:41,405 --> 00:50:43,965
That would be a dream come true.

764
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:45,802
Reggie?

765
00:50:47,611 --> 00:50:48,543
Reggie?

766
00:50:48,712 --> 00:50:50,907
Ow! What are you doing?

767
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,875
Oof! Tomorrow's Thanksgiving.

768
00:50:56,053 --> 00:50:57,987
We must attack the fort tonight.

769
00:50:58,155 --> 00:51:01,647
Ah! Oh! Ah! Ow!

770
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:03,349
We shouldn't attack anything.

771
00:51:03,527 --> 00:51:06,087
He told me we must do it together.

772
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:08,356
Oh! Give me a break. He?

773
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:09,590
The Great Turkey?

774
00:51:09,766 --> 00:51:12,360
Ooh! He's a voice inside your head.

775
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:17,399
How dare you?
There is nothing inside my head.

776
00:51:18,175 --> 00:51:22,737
The Great Turkey is real.
I saw him with my own two eyes.

777
00:51:24,014 --> 00:51:26,847
The more you say that name,
the dumber it sounds. I mean...

778
00:51:28,018 --> 00:51:31,351
The Great Turkey is
the greatest turkey that I know

779
00:51:31,521 --> 00:51:35,048
and you will never be
as great as The Great Turkey

780
00:51:35,225 --> 00:51:38,023
who is the greatest turkey.

781
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:39,592
Okay.

782
00:51:41,465 --> 00:51:44,025
- Ah!
- I'm sorry, Reggie.

783
00:51:44,868 --> 00:51:47,735
I didn't grow up
on a nice free-range farm.

784
00:51:50,040 --> 00:51:54,477
<i>I grew up in a cold,</i>
<i>clinical factory.</i>

785
00:51:58,715 --> 00:52:02,207
<i>From the time we were born,</i>
<i>we were fattened up on formula.</i>

786
00:52:06,790 --> 00:52:10,282
<i>Except for me. My mother kept me</i>
<i>hidden from the humans.</i>

787
00:52:10,460 --> 00:52:13,623
- Is it time?
- Yes, sweetie.

788
00:52:13,797 --> 00:52:16,061
Now, these eggs are our future, Jake.

789
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:17,097
Take them and run

790
00:52:17,267 --> 00:52:20,794
and don't stop until you find
a safe place to start a new flock.

791
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:23,002
Mama, I'm scared.

792
00:52:24,741 --> 00:52:29,269
I know you are, dear.
But I need you to be brave now.

793
00:52:31,581 --> 00:52:34,072
Come on, Jake.
We're so proud of you. You can do it.

794
00:52:34,251 --> 00:52:35,946
Here you go. Careful now.

795
00:52:36,119 --> 00:52:37,416
We believe in you!

796
00:52:37,587 --> 00:52:41,455
Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!

797
00:52:47,364 --> 00:52:48,991
Hey!

798
00:52:49,432 --> 00:52:51,457
Stop!

799
00:52:56,640 --> 00:52:59,074
Jake, Jake, Jake, Jake!

800
00:53:12,122 --> 00:53:14,955
<i>- I failed.</i>

801
00:53:15,125 --> 00:53:18,219
<i>I let down my family,</i>
<i>and my flock.</i>

802
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:21,324
<i>I decided I was better off</i>
<i>going it alone</i>

803
00:53:21,498 --> 00:53:23,989
<i>where I could never hurt</i>
<i>anyone again.</i>

804
00:53:24,734 --> 00:53:28,465
<i>Then, he arrived.</i>
<i>The Great Turkey.</i>

805
00:53:29,172 --> 00:53:31,936
Listen to me, young Jake!

806
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,133
<i>He told me about my destiny.</i>

807
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:37,178
<i>He gave me the sacred time knob</i>
<i>and then told me...</i>

808
00:53:37,347 --> 00:53:38,336
Whoa!

809
00:53:38,515 --> 00:53:40,235
The most important thing
for you to remember

810
00:53:40,317 --> 00:53:42,046
is that you must never give up

811
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:45,382
no matter what stood in my way.

812
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:51,382
Jake, I'm sorry, that must have been
really hard to leave your family,

813
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:56,260
but storming a fort full of armed humans
is a terrible idea.

814
00:53:56,433 --> 00:53:59,698
I have a plan. I discovered
where the hunters store their weapons.

815
00:53:59,936 --> 00:54:04,373
We destroy the weapons,
we stop the feast.

816
00:54:04,908 --> 00:54:08,844
Yeah. And the hunters won't be a threat
and the flock will be safe.

817
00:54:09,012 --> 00:54:11,503
- Exactly!
- And Jenny's dream comes true.

818
00:54:11,681 --> 00:54:12,773
What?

819
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:15,241
Nothing. I'm in.

820
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:22,916
Ha!

821
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:26,968
So, what's your plan for getting in?

822
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:29,794
- All right, you got the easy part.
- Yeah, yeah, what?

823
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:32,196
I'm going to use my incredibly toned
pecs and buttocks

824
00:54:32,435 --> 00:54:34,494
- to throw you over the wall. Go!
- Ah!

825
00:54:38,642 --> 00:54:41,110
- Hm. Might have to adjust my angle.
- No!

826
00:54:41,278 --> 00:54:44,304
You're not adjusting anything!
I have a better idea.

827
00:54:47,050 --> 00:54:49,541
Okay, if we carefully project
our impact point,

828
00:54:49,719 --> 00:54:51,152
we should be able to safely...

829
00:54:51,321 --> 00:54:53,380
Ah! I've got a splinter.

830
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:57,048
Huh? What?

831
00:55:04,067 --> 00:55:05,466
Oh!

832
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:08,160
Ow!

833
00:55:15,111 --> 00:55:18,080
Ah!

834
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:20,148
It's always the tiny ones
that really hurt.

835
00:55:20,317 --> 00:55:22,148
Oh!

836
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:25,580
Ah!

837
00:55:27,457 --> 00:55:30,255
No! No!

838
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:40,595
- Did anybody see you? Jake!
- Whoo!

839
00:55:40,770 --> 00:55:43,204
- Hold on! This is amazing!
- Jake!

840
00:55:43,373 --> 00:55:46,308
This is incredible.
I can't seem to catch this dot.

841
00:55:48,044 --> 00:55:50,012
Oh, that hurt.

842
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:57,278
You gotta try this incredible workout.

843
00:56:01,291 --> 00:56:04,226
One of us may have to do some recon
to get a better look.

844
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:08,161
- Really?
- Little nautical trick I picked up.

845
00:56:08,331 --> 00:56:11,129
Thirty-eight percent
more magnification.

846
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:13,992
It goes "whomp" again!

847
00:56:16,840 --> 00:56:19,968
- Hey, where are the dogs?
- I think they're outside!

848
00:56:20,677 --> 00:56:23,475
Okay, I'm gonna rig the powder barrels
by the weapons shed.

849
00:56:23,646 --> 00:56:27,138
You rig the barrels in the wagon.
We'll blow the place sky high.

850
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:29,979
- No weapons...
- No Thanksgiving!

851
00:56:30,153 --> 00:56:31,142
Move out!

852
00:57:10,794 --> 00:57:13,763
- Oh!
- But Mummy!

853
00:57:13,930 --> 00:57:17,366
- Ah!
- I don't want to wear short pants!

854
00:57:17,534 --> 00:57:18,933
No...

855
00:57:20,904 --> 00:57:25,238
Psst! Space Turkey.
He sleeps with his eyes open.

856
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:27,273
It's creepy.

857
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:32,776
Oh...

858
00:57:34,384 --> 00:57:35,817
Powder horn!

859
00:57:36,386 --> 00:57:37,717
TFF! TFF!

860
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:40,117
Grandpa Jake,
tell us the story again about the horn.

861
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:43,225
Oh-ho! That old chestnut?

862
00:57:51,601 --> 00:57:54,092
I think the Space Turkey
has gone crazy.

863
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:08,511
Stupid mutts!

864
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:14,281
What is that?

865
00:58:14,757 --> 00:58:17,692
Somebody named Ranger
might need a little proof.

866
00:58:39,816 --> 00:58:41,147
That's one.

867
00:58:41,784 --> 00:58:44,446
What is it? It's... It's...

868
00:58:49,158 --> 00:58:51,285
That's two! We did it!

869
00:58:51,461 --> 00:58:53,258
Fire! Fire!

870
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,655
- Fire!
- What's that noise?

871
00:58:55,832 --> 00:58:58,562
- It's a fire! Bucket Brigade!
- Wake up! We need water! Alarm!

872
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:04,905
Okay, Furley. Play it cool and maybe
they will take us back to the future

873
00:59:05,074 --> 00:59:07,872
so we can have
an excellent adventure.

874
00:59:08,044 --> 00:59:11,411
- Ooh!
- What have you done?!

875
00:59:11,581 --> 00:59:15,574
It was the Space Turkey.
Tell them, Furley! <i>rale!</i>

876
00:59:15,752 --> 00:59:17,652
- You've been to the fort!
- No!

877
00:59:17,820 --> 00:59:20,516
No, no, you don't understand!
We destroyed the weapons and traps.

878
00:59:20,690 --> 00:59:23,488
We even got the hunters' wagon.
It's gone, we blew it up!

879
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:26,985
How did you do this?

880
00:59:27,130 --> 00:59:31,396
- Actually, it was Jake's plan.
- Thanks, buddy.

881
00:59:31,568 --> 00:59:33,900
How do we know
you're telling the truth?

882
00:59:35,605 --> 00:59:36,765
Hm!

883
00:59:57,026 --> 01:00:00,359
Excuse me, sorry. Jenny!
Jenny, wait!

884
01:00:10,106 --> 01:00:11,038
Quickly!
We need more water. Hurry!

885
01:00:11,207 --> 01:00:13,266
Oh! We're under attack!
Sound the alarms!

886
01:00:13,710 --> 01:00:14,904
Fortify the gate, little one!

887
01:00:15,078 --> 01:00:18,104
- Mother!
- I'll make sure the food is safe.

888
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:21,306
Captain Standish!
Thank God you're here.

889
01:00:23,786 --> 01:00:24,684
Are you going to eat that corn?

890
01:00:24,887 --> 01:00:28,414
Oh!

891
01:00:28,958 --> 01:00:32,553
What are we going to do?!
Please say it wasn't the Indians.

892
01:00:32,729 --> 01:00:35,664
- It wasn't the Indians.
- A-ha-ha!

893
01:00:35,832 --> 01:00:39,029
Well, a traitor in our midst, perhaps.

894
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:41,897
It was those bleeding birds.

895
01:00:43,940 --> 01:00:47,103
You mean turkeys did this?

896
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:54,249
Oh, they ain't regular birds.
They got magical powers!

897
01:00:54,784 --> 01:00:57,912
I've seen them disappear into thin air!

898
01:00:58,087 --> 01:01:01,989
Seen another two flying in a giant egg.

899
01:01:02,158 --> 01:01:05,423
They're playing with my mind.
Trying to drive me crazy.

900
01:01:11,134 --> 01:01:14,968
Well, I should say
they've succeeded, eh?

901
01:01:15,138 --> 01:01:16,833
- Well, then...
- Oh dear.

902
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:31,412
Hm...

903
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:34,021
Show me the way.

904
01:01:48,871 --> 01:01:51,396
So, I guess this means
you'll be heading home,

905
01:01:51,574 --> 01:01:54,634
to the future,
now that your mission is done.

906
01:01:54,811 --> 01:01:58,907
Actually, there's one more thing
I need to do.

907
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:00,982
Ask you to come with me.

908
01:02:03,820 --> 01:02:06,414
Wait...

909
01:02:06,589 --> 01:02:07,647
You're serious?

910
01:02:07,824 --> 01:02:09,689
I know you said that your place
was here with the flock.

911
01:02:09,859 --> 01:02:11,724
But I figure the flock is safe now.

912
01:02:11,894 --> 01:02:13,452
- The hunters are gone...
- Reggie.

913
01:02:13,663 --> 01:02:14,994
Please say yes.

914
01:02:15,665 --> 01:02:16,723
- No!
- No?

915
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:18,264
Couldn't you maybe think about it?

916
01:02:18,434 --> 01:02:19,560
No, no, no, no!
What is that?

917
01:02:21,037 --> 01:02:23,699
Oh, no...

918
01:02:32,381 --> 01:02:33,348
Hey!

919
01:02:33,516 --> 01:02:35,609
He's not as aerodynamic
as I'd hoped.

920
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:36,945
Hey.

921
01:02:41,591 --> 01:02:42,580
Wait.

922
01:02:44,694 --> 01:02:46,423
You led them right to us, Jake!

923
01:02:46,596 --> 01:02:47,893
Me?

924
01:02:58,941 --> 01:03:00,203
There you are.

925
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:01,641
Oh, no.

926
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:04,609
Come on boys.
We're gonna have a feast.

927
01:03:10,586 --> 01:03:12,781
This is all your fault!

928
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:19,058
- Jake!
- I knew he was a coward.

929
01:03:19,595 --> 01:03:21,062
Stop!

930
01:03:22,265 --> 01:03:25,792
Everyone, quickly!
Initiate the evacuation plan!

931
01:03:27,370 --> 01:03:29,930
- Go, go, go!
- Oh, Justy.

932
01:03:31,941 --> 01:03:34,466
I'm sorry, Jenny. We failed.
We led them right to you.

933
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:36,475
That doesn't matter right now.
Come on!

934
01:03:39,715 --> 01:03:41,979
Quickly, this way!

935
01:03:45,188 --> 01:03:47,247
Come here, my little friend!

936
01:03:47,423 --> 01:03:48,515
Come on, grab them all!

937
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:51,015
Hey, friend.

938
01:03:53,596 --> 01:03:55,826
Ah! Gotcha!

939
01:03:56,499 --> 01:03:58,694
Down the line then, down the line!

940
01:03:58,868 --> 01:04:00,995
Got two more!

941
01:04:01,170 --> 01:04:03,866
- I gotcha, brother!
- No, no!

942
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:05,132
Come on everybody.

943
01:04:05,708 --> 01:04:07,676
Oh! Back this way!

944
01:04:07,844 --> 01:04:09,835
Oh!

945
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:15,711
Go get them, boys!

946
01:04:22,024 --> 01:04:22,786
Ah!

947
01:04:24,026 --> 01:04:25,118
Where do we go?

948
01:04:26,696 --> 01:04:28,527
If you won't come out...

949
01:04:30,800 --> 01:04:32,665
we'll burn you out!

950
01:04:43,746 --> 01:04:46,647
To the tide pools!
It's our only way out now!

951
01:04:51,220 --> 01:04:55,213
Reggie, the nursery!
We have to go back!

952
01:04:59,061 --> 01:05:00,050
Come on!

953
01:05:04,567 --> 01:05:07,400
- Get down to the pools!
- Whoa!

954
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:10,231
Quickly! Come on, hurry up!

955
01:05:21,951 --> 01:05:24,920
Jenny! Jenny!

956
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:28,485
No!

957
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:31,854
- I'll find another way!
- But there is no other way!

958
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:35,790
Jake!

959
01:05:43,639 --> 01:05:44,799
Come on, let's go!

960
01:05:59,422 --> 01:06:02,755
Don't be scared, Furley.
<i>rale!</i>

961
01:06:02,925 --> 01:06:05,291
- Gather everyone onto the beach.
- Yes, Father.

962
01:06:07,296 --> 01:06:08,388
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon,
c'mon, c'mon!

963
01:06:08,531 --> 01:06:10,123
This way, run, run!

964
01:06:18,407 --> 01:06:20,739
Go! Hurry!

965
01:06:25,581 --> 01:06:27,048
Get the eggs to safety!

966
01:06:30,753 --> 01:06:31,742
Dad!

967
01:06:33,522 --> 01:06:36,616
- Go! Join the others!
- Not without you!

968
01:06:38,594 --> 01:06:39,583
Jenny...

969
01:06:40,363 --> 01:06:41,352
Daddy!

970
01:06:42,765 --> 01:06:45,461
I'll always be with you.

971
01:07:23,572 --> 01:07:25,733
Got dinner! We got dinner!

972
01:08:44,053 --> 01:08:47,250
This half shell was my father's.

973
01:08:47,423 --> 01:08:51,655
Whichever of his children has
the other half, will be Chief.

974
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:04,497
What?

975
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:08,407
What?

976
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:25,717
Father chose wisely.

977
01:09:37,273 --> 01:09:39,639
My father loved this flock.

978
01:09:39,808 --> 01:09:42,971
And he will always be a part of it.

979
01:09:43,145 --> 01:09:46,444
He gave his life to give us ours.

980
01:09:46,615 --> 01:09:48,776
So, we will honor him.

981
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:53,047
But right now, we need to do
what we must to survive.

982
01:09:53,222 --> 01:09:54,655
This is all my fault.

983
01:09:54,823 --> 01:09:58,156
They have taken our home.
They've taken our family.

984
01:09:58,327 --> 01:10:01,194
We have only one choice now.

985
01:10:01,363 --> 01:10:03,490
We will fight!

986
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:08,297
We will stand and fight!
This is our home!

987
01:10:08,704 --> 01:10:11,468
No more hiding!
We will attack the fort,

988
01:10:11,640 --> 01:10:14,473
free our family
and make our flock whole once again!

989
01:10:14,643 --> 01:10:15,871
Who's with me!?

990
01:10:16,579 --> 01:10:18,809
- We fight!
- We fight!

991
01:10:18,981 --> 01:10:21,176
We fight, brother!

992
01:10:37,032 --> 01:10:39,398
<i>Good morning, Reggie.</i>

993
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:43,334
<i>Why the long face?</i>
<i>That is a punch line from a joke.</i>

994
01:10:43,505 --> 01:10:46,099
- Just take me home.
- Reggie, wait!

995
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:48,038
The flock is in trouble.

996
01:10:48,210 --> 01:10:51,111
Yup! And you know why?
Because of us!

997
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:53,510
We didn't save anyone.
We made everything worse!

998
01:10:53,849 --> 01:10:56,215
But Reggie,
The Great Turkey told me...

999
01:10:56,385 --> 01:10:58,012
There is no Great Turkey!

1000
01:10:58,387 --> 01:11:01,584
There is no mission.
You made it all up in your head.

1001
01:11:01,757 --> 01:11:04,021
It's all a lie.

1002
01:11:05,027 --> 01:11:08,588
Now, I'm leaving, all right,
before we mess things up even more!

1003
01:11:08,764 --> 01:11:10,925
And if you're smart
you'll come with me.

1004
01:11:12,067 --> 01:11:13,466
I can't give up.

1005
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:16,231
Yeah, if you're smart.

1006
01:11:18,474 --> 01:11:21,034
Look who I'm talking to.

1007
01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:41,886
Turkey! Turkey! Turkey!
Turkey! Turkey!

1008
01:11:42,064 --> 01:11:43,895
I wanna fly the spaceship.

1009
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:46,267
Hey, guess who's back?
Bet you were wondering where I...

1010
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:47,460
I'm tired now.

1011
01:11:48,604 --> 01:11:50,970
was.

1012
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:54,007
- See you later, S.T.E.V. E...
- <i>Goodbye, Reggie.</i>

1013
01:11:59,348 --> 01:12:00,474
Hey!

1014
01:12:01,483 --> 01:12:03,747
Hey, hey, hey! Wait! Wait!

1015
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:08,989
Snap out of it Reggie,
we don't have time for this!

1016
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:12,025
- Ah!
- Hey!

1017
01:12:13,762 --> 01:12:15,320
I'm breaking like a hundred
time travel rules,

1018
01:12:15,497 --> 01:12:18,159
and this might destroy the universe,
but I don't have a choice.

1019
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:21,701
I've come back from the future
to tell you something really important.

1020
01:12:21,870 --> 01:12:25,271
- What is it?
- You're an idiot.

1021
01:12:26,275 --> 01:12:29,540
Whoa! That's a little harsh.
I may not be a genius but...

1022
01:12:29,712 --> 01:12:32,875
Everything you want is back in 1621.

1023
01:12:33,048 --> 01:12:35,516
Jenny, Jake, a whole flock of friends.

1024
01:12:35,684 --> 01:12:38,278
Yeah, a flock that I totally messed up!

1025
01:12:38,454 --> 01:12:39,654
They're better off without me.

1026
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:41,983
No!

1027
01:12:42,157 --> 01:12:44,182
I've come from even farther
in the future

1028
01:12:44,360 --> 01:12:47,454
to tell you that Jenny and the flock
are gonna attack the fort!

1029
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:50,291
- They don't stand a chance!
- Oh, no.

1030
01:12:50,799 --> 01:12:53,199
- What do we do?!
- We need a plan.

1031
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:54,393
Exactly!

1032
01:12:55,804 --> 01:12:56,998
Whoa!

1033
01:12:57,673 --> 01:12:59,538
The Sacred Time Knob.

1034
01:12:59,708 --> 01:13:02,233
- The Sacred Time Knob!
- The Sacred Time Knob!

1035
01:13:02,411 --> 01:13:03,400
- Wait!
- Yeah?

1036
01:13:03,579 --> 01:13:05,638
- You know what this means?
- What does it mean?

1037
01:13:06,081 --> 01:13:09,983
It's so simple.
It means...

1038
01:13:10,152 --> 01:13:13,713
I need to go find
The Great Turkey.

1039
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:17,985
I bet he's behind the door
that this opens!

1040
01:13:18,160 --> 01:13:20,151
<i>Oh, come on!</i>

1041
01:13:20,863 --> 01:13:24,663
<i>You are The Great Turkey.</i>

1042
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:28,030
- I'm The Great Turkey?
- You're The Great Turkey!

1043
01:13:28,203 --> 01:13:30,899
Which means Jake was telling the truth
the whole time!

1044
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:32,836
Wow, I really am an idiot!

1045
01:13:33,008 --> 01:13:34,532
I hate to say I told you so.

1046
01:13:34,710 --> 01:13:36,837
Wait, if I am idiot
then you're an idiot.

1047
01:13:37,012 --> 01:13:40,743
No, no, guys, guys, guys,
technically, we're all idiots.

1048
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:43,544
- But we're also all...
- The Great Turkey!

1049
01:13:43,719 --> 01:13:46,449
My mind is being literally
blown right now!

1050
01:13:46,622 --> 01:13:48,715
Mine, too!

1051
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:50,171
I came back to make sure we stop

1052
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:52,453
and appreciate just
how awesome this is.

1053
01:13:52,628 --> 01:13:53,925
That's awesome.

1054
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:55,358
- Awesome.
- Awesome.

1055
01:13:55,531 --> 01:13:57,829
<i>Yes, totally awesome.</i>

1056
01:13:58,066 --> 01:14:01,433
<i>Now, if you are done,</i>
<i>you need to go back in time,</i>

1057
01:14:01,637 --> 01:14:06,074
<i>give young Jake his destiny</i>
<i>and then save your friends.</i>

1058
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:08,266
Right, I got to get going!

1059
01:14:14,550 --> 01:14:16,541
C'mon S.T.E.V.E., let's go.

1060
01:14:25,894 --> 01:14:27,953
We take positions here and here.

1061
01:14:28,130 --> 01:14:31,566
Their guns are destroyed,
so we've got a fighting chance. If we...

1062
01:14:31,700 --> 01:14:32,894
He's back.

1063
01:14:34,970 --> 01:14:36,130
You!

1064
01:15:14,343 --> 01:15:15,708
Where's Reggie?

1065
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:28,347
Whoa!

1066
01:15:32,661 --> 01:15:33,491
Huh?

1067
01:15:36,331 --> 01:15:39,425
Listen to me, young Jake!

1068
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:42,126
Oh, what? Who are you?

1069
01:15:42,671 --> 01:15:45,663
I am The Great Turkey!

1070
01:15:45,841 --> 01:15:48,332
The greatest of all turkeys!

1071
01:15:48,510 --> 01:15:50,171
And I've come here
to give you a mission!

1072
01:15:50,345 --> 01:15:53,212
Not to save ten turkeys,
or even a hundred,

1073
01:15:53,382 --> 01:15:55,145
but all of them!

1074
01:15:55,317 --> 01:15:57,217
All of them?

1075
01:15:57,386 --> 01:16:02,323
First you must go to Camp David
and find the pardoned turkey.

1076
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:05,585
The awesome pardoned turkey!

1077
01:16:05,761 --> 01:16:07,752
The awesome pardoned turkey?

1078
01:16:07,930 --> 01:16:11,058
Well, he's not always awesome...

1079
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:14,228
but he gets awesomer
as it goes along.

1080
01:16:14,403 --> 01:16:16,894
And you will need this for your journey.

1081
01:16:17,172 --> 01:16:18,469
Whoa! What is it?

1082
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:23,867
It is the sacred time knob!
It is very powerful!

1083
01:16:24,046 --> 01:16:25,035
Whoa!

1084
01:16:25,213 --> 01:16:27,704
It will protect you
and keep you safe from harm!

1085
01:16:27,883 --> 01:16:30,215
But the most important thing
for you to remember

1086
01:16:30,385 --> 01:16:33,183
is that you must never give up, ever!

1087
01:16:33,355 --> 01:16:35,346
No matter what stands in your way!

1088
01:16:35,524 --> 01:16:37,389
<i>No matter</i>
<i>what stands in your way!</i>

1089
01:16:37,559 --> 01:16:39,550
<i>No matter what stands in your way!</i>

1090
01:16:56,345 --> 01:16:58,313
Hooh! Ha-hah!

1091
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,471
Hooh! Ha-hah!

1092
01:17:00,649 --> 01:17:02,617
Hooh! Ha-hah!

1093
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:04,649
Hooh! Ha-hah!

1094
01:17:17,866 --> 01:17:18,855
Now!

1095
01:17:21,737 --> 01:17:23,830
Yeah! <i>rale!</i> Yah-ha!

1096
01:17:31,980 --> 01:17:33,504
Oh!

1097
01:17:34,816 --> 01:17:38,752
Mm. Those are some angry birds.

1098
01:17:38,920 --> 01:17:41,286
- Charge!
- For the flock!

1099
01:17:45,727 --> 01:17:47,695
Ha-ha!

1100
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:52,862
- Get the cannons!
- Cannons? For turkeys, sir?

1101
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:55,026
Get the cannons and form a line!

1102
01:18:06,782 --> 01:18:08,010
Ready...

1103
01:18:09,384 --> 01:18:11,716
- Oh, no!
- Oh!

1104
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:14,247
Fire!

1105
01:18:40,849 --> 01:18:42,111
Huh?

1106
01:19:05,807 --> 01:19:08,037
Uh! Uh!

1107
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:20,983
Whoa!

1108
01:19:25,460 --> 01:19:26,859
The Great Turkey.

1109
01:19:33,635 --> 01:19:36,069
Hey everybody, welcome!

1110
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:38,729
A giant egg. Looks delicious...

1111
01:19:44,112 --> 01:19:46,910
<i>Conservatively dressed</i>
<i>human beings!</i>

1112
01:19:47,649 --> 01:19:51,380
<i>I'd like to introduce The Great Turkey!</i>

1113
01:19:56,858 --> 01:20:00,555
It wasn't The Great Turkey.
It was always Reggie.

1114
01:20:03,965 --> 01:20:05,125
My best friend.

1115
01:20:05,300 --> 01:20:09,430
<i>He brings blessings</i>
<i>to all of you. Honor him.</i>

1116
01:20:17,612 --> 01:20:18,943
What is it?

1117
01:20:27,189 --> 01:20:30,522
A sign from the Grandfathers!

1118
01:20:30,692 --> 01:20:32,853
A most delicious sign!

1119
01:20:34,296 --> 01:20:36,287
We should really do this more often.

1120
01:20:41,303 --> 01:20:45,364
Wow, this is way outside
my free delivery zone.

1121
01:20:48,176 --> 01:20:51,873
<i>You should try the</i>
<i>breadsticks too. They're delicious.</i>

1122
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:00,549
Yeah!

1123
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:03,555
You did it, Reggie.
You saved us all.

1124
01:21:03,725 --> 01:21:05,818
Actually, I did! Yeah!

1125
01:21:05,994 --> 01:21:08,724
And I saved you.
So technically, I saved everyone.

1126
01:21:08,897 --> 01:21:10,922
So hooray for me!

1127
01:21:12,567 --> 01:21:14,797
Isn't this wonderful, Justy?

1128
01:21:14,936 --> 01:21:17,564
Meow. Meow. Meow. Meow.

1129
01:21:19,975 --> 01:21:21,966
- Hm!
- Hm!

1130
01:21:24,079 --> 01:21:26,013
- That's mine!
- That's my slice!

1131
01:21:29,517 --> 01:21:30,814
Ow!

1132
01:21:37,192 --> 01:21:39,683
- Shut up, Fatty. Oh, hey, Jarold.
- Oh, hey, Mrs...

1133
01:21:40,161 --> 01:21:45,690
Mr. Anchovy, you have soiled our pizza
with your small, dried fish.

1134
01:21:45,867 --> 01:21:48,495
Mm... Tastes like dirty sock.

1135
01:21:48,670 --> 01:21:50,968
Still, better than my wife's cooking.
Am I right?

1136
01:21:53,575 --> 01:21:56,510
- Hey guys, check it out.
- Dude, please.

1137
01:21:58,313 --> 01:22:00,679
Whoa!

1138
01:22:01,116 --> 01:22:02,879
Thank you, Great Turkey.

1139
01:22:04,619 --> 01:22:09,181
Look, everyone,
I'm giving this turkey thanks.

1140
01:22:10,592 --> 01:22:14,187
Wait a minute,
I just invented a word! Ha-ha!

1141
01:22:14,362 --> 01:22:17,820
It's a thanks-giving!
You like that?

1142
01:22:18,033 --> 01:22:20,661
Happy Thanksgiving, everyone!

1143
01:22:23,405 --> 01:22:25,305
<i>Now, that I wasn't on the menu,</i>

1144
01:22:25,473 --> 01:22:27,236
<i>I could see the holidays</i>
<i>for what they were.</i>

1145
01:22:28,209 --> 01:22:29,369
<i>A time to share.</i>

1146
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:33,812
<i>A time to come together.</i>

1147
01:22:34,649 --> 01:22:38,346
<i>To be with the ones we care about</i>
<i>and who care about us.</i>

1148
01:22:40,121 --> 01:22:43,716
<i>I thought I wanted to be alone.</i>
El Solo Lobo.

1149
01:22:44,292 --> 01:22:47,625
<i>Which I later found out</i>
<i>was actually</i> El Lobo Solitario.

1150
01:22:48,330 --> 01:22:52,323
<i>Turned out I just needed to find</i>
<i>where I belonged.</i>

1151
01:22:56,004 --> 01:22:57,884
Are you sure you won't stay here
with the flock?

1152
01:22:57,973 --> 01:22:59,998
I'm a turkey of action, Reggie.

1153
01:23:00,175 --> 01:23:02,871
Well, then, I guess this is goodbye.

1154
01:23:03,078 --> 01:23:06,104
No, Reggie,
goodbyes are just hellos

1155
01:23:06,348 --> 01:23:09,317
carried across the wind
till our paths

1156
01:23:09,584 --> 01:23:11,051
intersect once again.

1157
01:23:11,219 --> 01:23:14,154
That's beautiful... and confusing.

1158
01:23:18,593 --> 01:23:21,619
Wild, undomesticated turkeys
of the past...

1159
01:23:21,796 --> 01:23:22,854
I'll never forget you.

1160
01:23:25,934 --> 01:23:27,526
<i>Where would you</i>
<i>like to go, Jake?</i>

1161
01:23:27,702 --> 01:23:31,502
Wherever we are needed, S.T.E.V. E...
Wherever we are needed.

1162
01:23:36,044 --> 01:23:39,104
So, is this turkey paradise?

1163
01:23:39,280 --> 01:23:41,180
Oh!

1164
01:23:43,651 --> 01:23:47,314
Wow, you're moving pretty fast
for a Pisces.

1165
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:48,786
Whatever that is.

1166
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:53,950
<i>Oh, my.</i>

1167
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:01,266
"UP AROUND THE BEND")

1168
01:25:27,655 --> 01:25:30,215
Whoa!

1169
01:25:33,595 --> 01:25:36,120
Jake, what happened?
You were only gone like a second!

1170
01:25:36,297 --> 01:25:37,992
I've actually been gone for years.

1171
01:25:38,166 --> 01:25:40,828
Have you heard about the turducken?!
