Baby.

367
00:30:41,240 --> 00:30:44,944
[Whispering]
Baby.

368
00:30:52,451 --> 00:30:54,453

369
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:56,555

370
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:58,524
It's Troy.

371
00:31:00,159 --> 00:31:01,127
Hey, you don't
need that, man.

372
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,628
I'm just here
to talk business.

373
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:03,329
What you say, man?

374
00:31:03,362 --> 00:31:05,097
I hear doin' business
with you

375
00:31:05,131 --> 00:31:06,632
don't go so well
for some people.

376
00:31:06,665 --> 00:31:08,034
What'd you hear?

377
00:31:08,067 --> 00:31:11,370
I heard your game
clock's running down.

378
00:31:13,205 --> 00:31:15,274
Look, I got 20 keys
for 100.

379
00:31:15,307 --> 00:31:18,510
100? Hmm.

380
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:20,312
You know, 100 is the--

381
00:31:20,346 --> 00:31:23,349
"I got clean stuff
and time to do business
right" price.

382
00:31:23,382 --> 00:31:26,185
Now, if I were to get
this shit from you,

383
00:31:26,218 --> 00:31:27,453
you could get the, uh,

384
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:32,091
"I gotta get my punk ass
outta town before I get
capped" price.

385
00:31:32,124 --> 00:31:34,593
How much
would that be?

386
00:31:34,626 --> 00:31:35,494
It don't matter.

387
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:37,696
Ain't nobody gonna
buy this shit from you.

388
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,999
No matter
how good the deal is,

389
00:31:40,032 --> 00:31:41,467
the price is too high.

390
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,502
So why don't you get
the fuck outta here

391
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:48,207
before I go boba fett
on your ass and
collect it for myself?

392
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:07,093
Did you sell it?

393
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:09,561
What happened?

394
00:32:09,595 --> 00:32:11,297
Nothin'.

395
00:32:12,031 --> 00:32:15,267
Well, are we
still leaving tonight?

396
00:32:15,301 --> 00:32:18,470
Honey,
we can't leave yet.

397
00:32:18,504 --> 00:32:19,638
Look, I don't know
anyplace else

398
00:32:19,671 --> 00:32:21,207
I can sell this stuff
but here,

399
00:32:21,240 --> 00:32:22,641
so who knows how long
it's gonna take?

400
00:32:22,674 --> 00:32:24,476
Just let me find a buyer
and we'll go.

401
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:28,047
Baby, let's just go,
please?

402
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:32,484
We got the stuff.
We can sell it
anywhere we want.

403
00:32:33,019 --> 00:32:35,454
I just don't
feel safe here, Troy.

404
00:32:35,487 --> 00:32:38,290
What are you
talking about?

405
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:40,426
It's a feeling.

406
00:32:40,459 --> 00:32:42,261
Pregnant women
get feelings, you know?

407
00:32:42,294 --> 00:32:46,032
Well, what if
we go to a motel?

408
00:32:48,300 --> 00:32:49,001
On the outside
of town,

409
00:32:49,035 --> 00:32:51,137
would that make you
feel better?

410
00:32:54,373 --> 00:32:57,143
Why are you even
still here with me?

411
00:32:57,176 --> 00:32:59,478
Please don't do this
right now, em.

412
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:00,412
I need to be gone.

413
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:02,681
Sell that stuff
on your own.

414
00:33:02,714 --> 00:33:06,318
You're
makin' a fortune.

415
00:33:06,352 --> 00:33:09,421
Why are you even
still here with me?

416
00:33:09,455 --> 00:33:13,392
Because I love you.

417
00:33:13,425 --> 00:33:15,027
And I love that baby.

418
00:33:15,061 --> 00:33:19,498
And I would never leave
either of you for anything.

419
00:33:37,183 --> 00:33:39,451
That's the alcohol.

420
00:33:39,485 --> 00:33:41,553
Shit! What the fuck
are you doing here?

421
00:33:41,587 --> 00:33:42,788
I'm bringing you
breakfast.

422
00:33:42,821 --> 00:33:46,192
Could you put that
down, please?

423
00:33:51,263 --> 00:33:53,365
I want you out.

424
00:33:53,399 --> 00:33:55,801
All right.

425
00:33:57,203 --> 00:33:58,470
Don't get
the wrong idea, ok?

426
00:33:58,504 --> 00:34:03,109
I knew a kid in high
school who passed out
from alcohol poisoning

427
00:34:03,142 --> 00:34:03,842
and never woke up,

428
00:34:03,875 --> 00:34:05,611
so I brought you home,

429
00:34:05,644 --> 00:34:08,580
slept on the couch.

430
00:34:10,349 --> 00:34:11,483
So there's
your breakfast,

431
00:34:11,517 --> 00:34:16,188
and you're
obviously alive and very
well-protected, so...

432
00:34:16,222 --> 00:34:18,557
I'm leaving.

433
00:34:20,592 --> 00:34:25,697
Um...you can stay
for breakfast.

434
00:34:25,731 --> 00:34:30,269
No. I'm gonna leave.

435
00:34:30,702 --> 00:34:33,772
Don't make me
force you.

436
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:38,210
Someone was
industrious this morning.

437
00:34:39,345 --> 00:34:41,180
Yeah. Um, for years,

438
00:34:41,213 --> 00:34:44,450
we had fresh flowers
in church
every morning.

439
00:34:44,750 --> 00:34:47,686
Church every morning?

440
00:34:47,719 --> 00:34:49,788
Guilty soul?

441
00:34:49,821 --> 00:34:50,856
Probably.

442
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:53,259
I was a priest.

443
00:34:53,859 --> 00:34:54,860
You're kidding.

444
00:34:54,893 --> 00:34:56,462
Swear to god.

445
00:34:56,495 --> 00:34:59,498
See, I can say
that kind of thing
now that i'm...

446
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:01,300
Not a priest
anymore.

447
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:03,235
So what was
the other night?

448
00:35:03,269 --> 00:35:07,239
Just can't get past
those celibacy vows?

449
00:35:07,273 --> 00:35:10,609
See, they tell you
that your love of god

450
00:35:10,642 --> 00:35:13,579
and his for you
is enough...

451
00:35:15,181 --> 00:35:16,081
But it wasn't.

452
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:18,450
Maybe that makes me weak
in the eyes of god,

453
00:35:18,484 --> 00:35:23,655
but I needed
earthly love.

454
00:35:25,924 --> 00:35:28,394
I have to go to work.

455
00:35:30,296 --> 00:35:32,798
Where do you work?

456
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:37,169
I'm a bean counter
at a commercial
real estate company.

457
00:35:37,203 --> 00:35:38,637
You like it?

458
00:35:38,670 --> 00:35:43,409
Yeah. Pays the bills
when I show up.

459
00:35:43,442 --> 00:35:44,810
Right.

460
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:49,715
Thanks for breakfast.

461
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:50,782
It was great.

462
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:55,621
Am--am I a masochist
if I ask for
your phone number?

463
00:35:56,588 --> 00:36:01,793
Right. I left mine
by the phone.

with the alcohol.

might wind up coming
home with you.

Would you put that out
while I'm trying to do this?

468
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,820
I'm scared. I smoke
when I'm scared.

469

You smoke
24 hours a day.

470
00:36:30,489 --> 00:36:32,691
Didn't the doctor
tell you it was bad
for the baby?

471
00:36:32,724 --> 00:36:37,496
Well, I guess
I'm a shitty mom,
then, aren't I?

472
00:36:39,631 --> 00:36:42,634
All right,
gimme that stuff.

I have a bad feeling
about this.

leave tomorrow.

just give it to me.

00:42:24,810 --> 00:42:26,344
55. Final.

544
00:42:26,377 --> 00:42:28,947
L-L-Look, hal,

545
00:42:28,980 --> 00:42:29,981
with all due respect,

546
00:42:30,015 --> 00:42:32,317
this is 20 fuckin' keys
we're talkin' about here.

547
00:42:32,350 --> 00:42:34,586
I need at least 65.

548
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:36,655
Did you hear me
say "final"?

549
00:42:36,688 --> 00:42:38,256
55.

550
00:42:41,192 --> 00:42:42,994
Fine.

551
00:42:44,129 --> 00:42:45,296
Ok.

552
00:42:45,330 --> 00:42:48,099
Tomorrow, call this number.

553
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:51,637
Someone'll tell you
where to bring it.

554
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:52,738
Have a good day.

555
00:42:52,771 --> 00:42:53,772
Thanks for comin' in.

556
00:42:53,805 --> 00:42:57,709
You, uh, you oughta
get that hand looked at, huh?

557
00:42:59,811 --> 00:43:02,147
Yuppie-ass fuckface.

558
00:43:03,982 --> 00:43:05,016
Bitch, chill.

559
00:43:05,050 --> 00:43:08,654
You make me spill this,
I'm gonna fuckin' smack you.

560
00:43:08,687 --> 00:43:10,956
What did I say?! Huh?!

561
00:43:12,090 --> 00:43:15,326
[Knock on door]

562
00:43:18,429 --> 00:43:20,198
Money.

563
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:22,467
Who's that?

564
00:43:22,500 --> 00:43:25,203
C.j.: I'm lookin'
for Troy.

565
00:43:31,409 --> 00:43:33,144
Come on in.

566
00:43:33,178 --> 00:43:35,246
It's open.

567
00:43:43,689 --> 00:43:45,857
Troy!
I ain't seen him!

568
00:43:45,891 --> 00:43:47,292
Left or right?

569
00:43:47,325 --> 00:43:49,127
Ok, fuck!

570
00:43:49,160 --> 00:43:50,796
I got his number.

571
00:43:50,829 --> 00:43:53,331
Some shitty motel.

572
00:44:27,132 --> 00:44:28,700
Hello?

573
00:44:29,835 --> 00:44:33,705
Yeah. Do you guys
have any vending machines?

574
00:44:35,874 --> 00:44:37,709
Across the street?

575
00:44:37,743 --> 00:44:39,677
That's it?

576
00:44:40,746 --> 00:44:42,113
Ok.

577
00:45:00,531 --> 00:45:02,333
Thanks.

578
00:45:14,780 --> 00:45:15,546
Hostess: One?

579
00:45:15,580 --> 00:45:16,447
Ok. Would you like
to sit at a booth?

580
00:45:16,481 --> 00:45:21,319
Um, I don't think
we could fit at a booth.

581
00:45:21,352 --> 00:45:22,453
Do you guys
have a bathroom?

582
00:45:22,487 --> 00:45:24,355
Oh, sure.
Right back there.

583
00:45:24,389 --> 00:45:25,456
Can I start you
with some coffee?

584
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:29,828
Oh, jeez, please.
[Laughs]

585
00:45:48,513 --> 00:45:51,950
Emily: Excuse me?

586
00:45:53,852 --> 00:45:54,786
Yeah?

587
00:45:54,820 --> 00:45:57,455
Is there any toilet paper
in that other stall?

588
00:45:59,224 --> 00:46:01,192
Uh-huh.

589
00:46:12,237 --> 00:46:15,173
Have you
ever been pregnant?

590
00:46:17,142 --> 00:46:17,943
No.

591
00:46:17,976 --> 00:46:21,947
You have to pee,
like, 100 times a day.

592
00:46:21,980 --> 00:46:23,348
[Urinates]

593
00:46:23,381 --> 00:46:24,415
Ohhh.

594
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:27,986
They say that
it's the best thing
a woman can do,

595
00:46:28,019 --> 00:46:30,956
but it sure as hell
doesn't feel like it.

596
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:05,423
* dance with me

597
00:47:06,992 --> 00:47:12,163
* dance with me

598
00:47:12,397 --> 00:47:17,302
* let's dance

599
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,242
What are you doing?!

600
00:47:24,275 --> 00:47:27,345
Stop it! Stop it!

601
00:47:27,378 --> 00:47:28,914
Leave me alone!

602
00:47:28,947 --> 00:47:32,884
Take it out!
C.J., take it out!

603
00:47:33,618 --> 00:47:35,153
C.j.

604
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:42,060
* dance with me

605
00:47:42,093 --> 00:47:43,528
get out!

606
00:47:43,561 --> 00:47:45,430
Aah!

607
00:47:45,463 --> 00:47:47,565
Just leave me alone.

608
00:47:55,673 --> 00:47:58,876
Leave me alone.

609
00:48:20,065 --> 00:48:22,267
Whose is it?

610
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:24,635
It's mine.

611
00:48:24,669 --> 00:48:26,171
I don't want it.

612
00:48:26,204 --> 00:48:29,407
Why? I mean,
like this?

613
00:48:29,440 --> 00:48:31,376
What are you
doing here?

614
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:33,411
You invited me
to dinner.

615
00:48:33,444 --> 00:48:35,013
I canceled.

616
00:48:35,046 --> 00:48:38,183
I ignored that part.

617
00:48:41,752 --> 00:48:43,688
Did you--

618
00:48:44,555 --> 00:48:45,656
is it gone?

619
00:48:45,690 --> 00:48:50,061
Doctor: I take it you
don't want this baby,
Ms. March.

620
00:48:51,362 --> 00:48:53,298
So I'm still--

621
00:48:53,331 --> 00:48:54,132
yes.

622
00:48:54,165 --> 00:48:56,601
You did an excellent
job of lacerating

623
00:48:56,634 --> 00:48:59,004
the internal wall
of your vagina,

624
00:48:59,037 --> 00:49:01,272
but you didn't
reach the uterus,

625
00:49:01,306 --> 00:49:05,110
so for a while,
you'll find sex
painful,

626
00:49:05,143 --> 00:49:06,611
urination
excruciating,

627
00:49:06,644 --> 00:49:11,282
and there's a good
chance of infection.

628
00:49:13,184 --> 00:49:15,586
You have
an appointment
for tomorrow.

629
00:49:15,620 --> 00:49:21,426
Why on earth
would you do this
to yourself today?

630
00:49:23,494 --> 00:49:25,997
Well, they
never tell me why.

631
00:49:26,031 --> 00:49:28,566
I don't know
why I keep asking.

632
00:49:28,766 --> 00:49:30,468
All right,
Ms. March,

633
00:49:30,501 --> 00:49:33,071
if you don't want
this baby that much,

634
00:49:33,104 --> 00:49:35,673
then let's
get it over with.

635
00:49:35,706 --> 00:49:38,443
Are you gonna
do the abortion now?

636
00:49:38,476 --> 00:49:39,377
I am.

637
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:41,679
And I don't mind
telling you

638
00:49:41,712 --> 00:49:45,250
it's gonna hurt
like hell.

639
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:59,630
Ms. March.

640
00:49:59,664 --> 00:50:02,467
Ready?

641
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:10,141
Carol Jean.

642
00:50:10,175 --> 00:50:11,609
I'm sorry?

643
00:50:11,642 --> 00:50:15,280
My name. It's Carol Jean.

644
00:50:15,313 --> 00:50:16,814
Don't worry, Carol Jean.

645
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:20,051
You'll be fine.

646
00:50:29,227 --> 00:50:31,296
Right in here.

647
00:50:42,840 --> 00:50:45,143
Rick: I'm here
with c.J. March.

648
00:50:45,176 --> 00:50:46,577
Uh, she's been
back there a while.

649
00:50:46,611 --> 00:50:49,314
I just wanted to make
sure everything
was all right.

650
00:50:49,347 --> 00:50:50,215
Oh, I'm sure it is.

651
00:50:50,248 --> 00:50:52,183
The procedure takes
about a half an hour.

652
00:50:52,217 --> 00:50:53,218
Procedure?

653
00:50:53,251 --> 00:50:55,620
Mm-hmm.

654
00:50:55,653 --> 00:50:57,155
Doctor: Now don't
you worry, Carol Jean,

655
00:50:57,188 --> 00:50:58,489
everything'll be fine.

656
00:50:58,523 --> 00:51:00,158
All right, you relax.

657
00:51:00,191 --> 00:51:02,193
It doesn't take long.

658
00:51:02,493 --> 00:51:06,664
All right now,
scoot down, lean back.

659
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:12,470
Just relax.

660
00:51:43,168 --> 00:51:44,269
I don't want to do it.

661
00:51:44,302 --> 00:51:45,836
Get me off of this table.

662
00:51:45,870 --> 00:51:46,704
All right, c.J.

663
00:51:46,737 --> 00:51:48,773
No one's gonna force you
to do anything.

664
00:51:48,806 --> 00:51:50,175
It's all right.

665
00:51:50,208 --> 00:51:53,211
It's ok.

666
00:52:07,325 --> 00:52:08,859
Rick: It's ready.

667
00:52:10,828 --> 00:52:11,562
Come on.

668
00:52:11,596 --> 00:52:13,898
You invited me
to dinner, remember?

669
00:52:13,931 --> 00:52:17,168
The least you can do
is eat.

670
00:52:30,848 --> 00:52:33,618
You lived here long?

671
00:52:38,289 --> 00:52:41,392
I never asked you.
Where you from?

672
00:52:41,426 --> 00:52:42,760
Seattle.

673
00:52:42,793 --> 00:52:46,431
My mom and dad
still live there.

674
00:52:46,464 --> 00:52:48,333
Karen. Frank.

675
00:52:48,366 --> 00:52:49,500
She's a schoolteacher.

676
00:52:49,534 --> 00:52:53,371
He's an airplane mechanic.

677
00:52:54,372 --> 00:52:56,774
Happy little life, huh?

678
00:52:56,807 --> 00:52:57,942
Yeah.

679
00:52:57,975 --> 00:53:01,212
So where's
the part about being
so against having a child

680
00:53:01,246 --> 00:53:05,383
you're willing to mutilate
yourself come in?

681
00:53:08,486 --> 00:53:11,322
C.j.
I want you
to leave my house now.

682
00:53:11,356 --> 00:53:12,390
No. You want me
to leave,

683
00:53:12,423 --> 00:53:14,792
then you're gonna
have to force me
out at gunpoint.

684
00:53:14,825 --> 00:53:16,961
Heh!
Otherwise,
I'm staying,

685
00:53:16,994 --> 00:53:19,797
and we're getting
to know each other.

686
00:53:20,831 --> 00:53:23,434
[Sighs]

687
00:53:24,635 --> 00:53:28,373
I'm not gonna talk
about that.

688
00:53:28,406 --> 00:53:30,941
Ok.

689
00:53:30,975 --> 00:53:33,378
For now.

690
00:53:33,411 --> 00:53:35,012
Troy: Oh, you gotta be
fucking kidding me, man.

691
00:53:35,045 --> 00:53:39,417
Are you gonna take
this shit off my hands
or what?

692
00:53:39,450 --> 00:53:41,786
[Grinding]
Hey!

693
00:53:41,819 --> 00:53:44,489
Do you mind?

694
00:53:45,523 --> 00:53:47,392
No, no, it can't
be tomorrow, man.

695
00:53:47,425 --> 00:53:49,294
It's gotta be tonight.

696
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:50,561
Are you sure?

697
00:53:50,595 --> 00:53:53,030
All right. Fine.
Tomorrow.

698
00:53:53,063 --> 00:53:54,465
Damn it!

699
00:53:54,499 --> 00:53:56,334
[Grinding]

700
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:59,504
Would you
turn that off? Emily!

701
00:53:59,537 --> 00:54:01,672
You said
we were leaving today.

702
00:54:01,706 --> 00:54:02,607
Yeah, well, now it's
gonna be tomorrow.

703
00:54:02,640 --> 00:54:03,541
Well, I don't want it
to be tomorrow, Troy.

704
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:06,277
I told you I have
a bad feeling about this!

705
00:54:06,311 --> 00:54:07,512
The only bad feeling
you've got

706
00:54:07,545 --> 00:54:09,580
is that 10-pound
deadweight
in your stomach.

707
00:54:09,614 --> 00:54:10,315
It's your baby.

708
00:54:10,348 --> 00:54:12,350
How do I know
it's my baby? Huh?

709
00:54:12,383 --> 00:54:16,053
You know what?
Who knows whose
fucking baby it is?!

710
00:54:16,086 --> 00:54:18,856
[Sobbing] Oh, my god.

711
00:54:18,889 --> 00:54:20,991
Sorry, honey.

712
00:54:21,025 --> 00:54:21,892
I didn't mean that.

713
00:54:21,926 --> 00:54:26,297
I wish we didn't even
have this damn baby.

714
00:54:27,498 --> 00:54:28,699
Honey, don't.

715
00:54:28,733 --> 00:54:33,304
I mean it. I can't walk.
I can't sleep.

716
00:54:33,338 --> 00:54:36,374
I hate this thing
inside of me.

717
00:54:36,407 --> 00:54:38,309
Baby, don't. Please.

718
00:54:38,343 --> 00:54:39,143
Ow!

719
00:54:39,176 --> 00:54:43,581
Aah! Don't you
dare hit me, you fucker!

720
00:54:43,614 --> 00:54:45,015
You'll hurt the baby.

721
00:54:45,049 --> 00:54:46,684
I'm sorry!

722
00:54:46,717 --> 00:54:48,986
If you ever hit me again,

723
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:50,688

because they were afraid

no one would forgive them
for their crimes.

You think you have
the power to forgive me?
