<i>The origin of nesting dolls</i>
<i>is shrouded in mystery.</i>

217
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:33,358
Some say the oldest
are from China.

218
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,524
Still others say Japan.

219
00:15:35,634 --> 00:15:38,626
<i>I don't have any of those,</i>
<i>but the ones I do have are from Russia...</i>

220
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:43,674
and the Russians perfected
the art of nesting dolls.

221
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:47,542
This particular one here,
this is the crown jewel of my collection.

222
00:15:47,646 --> 00:15:49,546
It has 13 levels...

223
00:15:49,648 --> 00:15:53,084

to the teeny tiniest...

225
00:15:57,890 --> 00:16:00,324
Ruby. Huh.

226
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:03,418
Yeah. It's silly. I call her Ruby, because
if you look closely at her two little eyes...

227
00:16:03,529 --> 00:16:05,463
they look like rubies.

228
00:16:05,564 --> 00:16:07,623

I have to get a flashlight.

00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,250
- So why'd you let someone take it?
- My hat?

233
00:16:26,352 --> 00:16:29,947
Oh, I didn't let anybody take it.
I just mouthed off to the wrong person.

234
00:16:30,055 --> 00:16:32,353
- Sounds like your mouth
gets you in trouble a lot.
- It does.

235
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:34,949

I need to go over the music with her.

236
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:37,620
Does it look like Mom's here?

237
00:16:37,730 --> 00:16:40,164
Your mom went shopping.
She'll be back in about an hour.

238
00:16:40,265 --> 00:16:44,133

- Hi.

- Hey, you shut up.
He's wanted in three states.

- Fiancé.

- They must eat out of

248
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:25,642

even looks like a piece of cardboard.

251

252
00:17:35,654 --> 00:17:39,249
I don't know what it says.

253
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:44,193
Mmm, I think working here

- I see you're working with acrylics?
- Mm-hmm?

302
00:20:51,883 --> 00:20:54,317
Why? Isn't oil much richer?

00:20:54,419 --> 00:20:59,755
- Oh, not another oil snob.
- I'm not an oil snob, it's just,
isn't acrylic a bit jejune?

304
00:20:59,858 --> 00:21:02,019
- Jejune?
- Yeah, it means...

00:21:08,667 --> 00:21:12,967
- How old are you, anyway?
- Older than my years.

00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:14,971
- Really?
- Yeah.

308

- And... you paint?
- Well, my mom's an artist,
so I kind of pick...

309

- Oh, that explains it.
- That explains... What does that explain?

310
00:21:23,415 --> 00:21:27,613
W-W-Wait. Doesn't anybody believe
in innate knowledge anymore?

311
00:21:27,719 --> 00:21:31,951
You know, Michelangelo was 15
when he painted the, uh, f..."farnas."

312
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:34,048
- <i>Infanta.</i>
- "Fanta." That's what I meant.

313
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:38,152
Actually, <i>Infantas</i> are Spanish.
Michelangelo was Italian.

- See ya later.
- All right.

320
00:22:00,585 --> 00:22:05,022
What the hell did I just say?
What the hell did I just say?

321
00:22:05,123 --> 00:22:07,216
Jesse Jackson.

322
00:22:24,743 --> 00:22:27,439
Dad?

323
00:22:31,383 --> 00:22:33,647
<i>Dad?</i>

324
00:22:34,753 --> 00:22:36,618
- Dad, get up.
- Aaah!

325
00:22:42,627 --> 00:22:45,118
Sorry.

326
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:52,193
- Hey, Pop.
- Keller.

327
00:22:52,304 --> 00:22:54,295
<i>You know,</i>
<i>a funny thing just happened to me.</i>

328
00:22:54,406 --> 00:22:56,397
I thought you were
dead on the couch.

329
00:22:56,508 --> 00:23:00,342
Oh, you mean Emmett. They didn't have
any empty beds at Care House.

330
00:23:00,445 --> 00:23:02,345
- <i>Emmett?</i>
- Uh-huh.

331
00:23:02,447 --> 00:23:04,745
So you bring him
to <i>our</i> house?

332
00:23:04,850 --> 00:23:08,479
Why don't you ever think about... Maybe
he might be dangerous to me and Mom.

333
00:23:08,587 --> 00:23:13,320
- <i>Hmm? Or steal all of our furniture?</i>
- He needed a place to sleep.

334
00:23:13,425 --> 00:23:17,088
Well, havin' him here makes it
feel more like home, anyway.

335
00:23:17,195 --> 00:23:21,097
Hey, I've been straight
for five years, almost six.

336
00:23:21,199 --> 00:23:23,190
That's a third of your life.

337
00:23:23,301 --> 00:23:27,328
Big deal.
I've been straight the whole time.

338
00:23:43,088 --> 00:23:45,420
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>That there's actual sand from Iwo Jima.</i>

339
00:23:45,524 --> 00:23:50,962
- Or your sister's fish tank.
- Well, it don't come with no
certificate of authenticity...

340
00:23:51,062 --> 00:23:55,021
Actually, I'm in the market
for an Airborne cap for my friend here.

341
00:23:55,133 --> 00:23:59,627
- I got one. Can't sell it to ya, though.
- Sure?

342
00:23:59,738 --> 00:24:03,469
- It has a lot of sentimental value.
- Yeah? How much?

343
00:24:03,575 --> 00:24:06,738
A lot.

344
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:12,042
What's this?

345
00:24:12,150 --> 00:24:15,813
General Ulysses S. Grant's
field flask, my friend.

346
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:19,423
And if that's the collected
works of Baudelaire...

347
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:22,118
throw it in.
We'll call it even.

348
00:24:23,428 --> 00:24:26,226
Listen, Bart.
I don't need it that bad.

349
00:24:26,331 --> 00:24:28,765
No worries.

350
00:24:28,867 --> 00:24:33,566
You got it all wrong.
War is just failed diplomacy.

351
00:24:33,672 --> 00:24:36,664
If you hate it so much,
why do you keep going to the battles?

352
00:24:36,775 --> 00:24:38,675
Mmm.

353
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:40,677
It looks good
on college applications.

354
00:24:40,779 --> 00:24:42,747
- You goin' to college?
- I got no choice.

355
00:24:44,649 --> 00:24:46,617
- Mmm.
- What happened to your face?

356
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:48,777
Oh.

357
00:24:48,887 --> 00:24:51,515
- Remember that guy, Lance,
I told you about?
- Same guy?

358
00:24:51,623 --> 00:24:54,091
<i>He's one pissed-off</i>
<i>little munchkin.</i>

359
00:24:54,192 --> 00:24:56,126
What are you gonna do about it?

360
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:59,994
- Nothing.
- Nothing?
What do you mean, "nothing"?

361
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:04,194
On the battlefield, you were running
around like Rambo on steroids.

362
00:25:04,302 --> 00:25:07,328
That's different.
I mean, that's just playin' around.

363
00:25:07,439 --> 00:25:11,705
So? Haven't you ever heard of
the 193rd Special Operations Wing?

364
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:15,644
- Never.
- Wanna get this guy?

365
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:18,316
- <i>[Bart] Target?</i>
- <i>[Kelly] Lance Norway.</i>

366
00:25:18,316 --> 00:25:21,342
- <i>Objective?</i>
- <i>Humiliation...</i>

367
00:25:21,453 --> 00:25:23,887
rage, despair.

368
00:25:23,989 --> 00:25:28,426
Easy enough. 'Nam's probably
our go-to war for that sort of thing.

369
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:31,826
I got the declassified briefs from
the Phoenix Project around here.

370
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:34,421
I knew my dad's crap
would come in handy.

371
00:25:34,533 --> 00:25:37,331
Hey, guys. I've got some
stretcher bars out in my car.

372
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:41,030
- Do you think one of you
could help me bring 'em in?
- Of course.

373
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:44,131
We'll drop what we're doing,
because what you're doing
must be more important.

374
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:47,973
- It is.
- Sure.

375
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:51,310
- I mean, I'll help.
- <i>Thanks.</i>

376
00:25:51,416 --> 00:25:55,443
- What is your...
- I'll find those reports!

377
00:26:05,163 --> 00:26:08,098
Perfect. Thanks.

378
00:26:14,306 --> 00:26:16,331
It's the waterfront.

379
00:26:18,276 --> 00:26:20,176
No, as a viewer,
I get to decide what it is...

380
00:26:20,278 --> 00:26:22,371
and it doesn't look anything like
a waterfront to me.

381
00:26:22,480 --> 00:26:24,846
It's the light.
I was playing with diffusion.

382
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,941
Put it away when you're
done with it, all right?

383
00:26:27,052 --> 00:26:29,043
Very funny.

384
00:26:30,789 --> 00:26:32,757
This is really nice, though.

385
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:35,052
Must be nice to have a place
like this to get away to, huh?

386
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:38,061
Yeah, it is.
It's great.

387
00:26:39,864 --> 00:26:41,764
So, what about Farmer?

388
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:45,199
- Farmer?
- Yeah, the boyfriend.

389
00:26:45,303 --> 00:26:49,569
- Miner?
- Miner. I'm sorry. Miner. Okay.

390
00:26:49,674 --> 00:26:53,542
Well, w-w-what about h...
Is he an artist too?

391
00:26:53,645 --> 00:26:56,205
So, you said your mom
was a painter?

392
00:26:56,314 --> 00:27:00,717
Ah, she used to be.
She still is, I guess.

393
00:27:00,819 --> 00:27:03,947
She had to turn it into a business,
'cause my dad stopped working.

394
00:27:04,055 --> 00:27:08,014
We got this family of Chinese immigrants
living in the house making them for her.

395
00:27:08,126 --> 00:27:10,287
Kinda like Andy Warhol's factory?

396
00:27:10,395 --> 00:27:15,230
Not his factory. More like...
More like Andy Warhol's tool shed.

397
00:27:16,468 --> 00:27:19,232
<i>It's nice, though.</i>
<i>I'm not dissing it.</i>

398
00:27:19,337 --> 00:27:21,635
- <i>I used to have my playpen</i>
<i>in her studio.</i>
- Huh.

399
00:27:21,740 --> 00:27:25,699
So, why'd your dad
stop working?

400
00:27:25,810 --> 00:27:28,301
He's a VH 1 documentary
without the music.

401
00:27:30,382 --> 00:27:33,783
Damn it, Kelly.
I can't plan your revenge by myself.

402
00:27:33,885 --> 00:27:37,377
- Come on!
- Have fun, boys.

403
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:41,823
Ha! Fun. If only war were fun.
War is deadly serious, ma'am.

404
00:27:45,563 --> 00:27:49,260
You know, I'm kinda worried about you
playing with diffusion unsupervised.

405
00:27:49,367 --> 00:27:51,597
- Are you?
- Yeah.

406
00:27:51,703 --> 00:27:54,331
I might have to come by and show you
some proper safety procedures.

407
00:27:54,439 --> 00:27:58,933
I don't think I have room
in here for a playpen.

408
00:28:08,586 --> 00:28:11,419
<i>[Kelly] Hey, Sarah! Wait up. Wait up.</i>
<i>Do you have the math homework?</i>

409
00:28:11,523 --> 00:28:13,684
- <i>[Sarah] Why? So you can cheat?</i>
- <i>Well, yeah. Can I?</i>

410
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:17,353
<i>No, but I'll tell you what.</i>

411
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:20,397
I have an extra ticket
to Aerosmith on Friday night.

412
00:28:20,498 --> 00:28:22,830
Is that gonna be loud?

413
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:25,459
Yeah. It's gonna be loud.
It's music.

414
00:28:25,570 --> 00:28:27,970
Yeah.

415
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:34,041
It might be really good for you to get out,
mingle with some normal people.

416
00:28:34,145 --> 00:28:36,670
Something could rub off on you,
I hope.

417
00:28:36,781 --> 00:28:41,548
Well, we'll talk about it
on the night shift. Yes? Okay.

418
00:28:47,225 --> 00:28:50,991
<i>[Bart] Citizens, this is the emergency</i>
<i>broadcast notification system.</i>

419
00:28:51,096 --> 00:28:56,329
This is not a test of the system.
This is an actual notif... Damn.

420
00:28:56,434 --> 00:28:59,961
- That was pretty good, except the end.
- Nah.

421
00:29:00,071 --> 00:29:04,770
Don't you love being a minor? There's no
consequences for illegal activities...

422
00:29:04,876 --> 00:29:07,606
you're not responsible
if the economy goes bad.

423
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,545
No drinking, no credit,
no freedom.

424
00:29:10,648 --> 00:29:14,345
- At least not at my house.
- You talk about it, but I never see.

425
00:29:14,452 --> 00:29:16,852
My parents do their best work
without an audience.

426
00:29:16,955 --> 00:29:18,980
Oh, yeah?

427
00:29:19,090 --> 00:29:23,117
- Like what?
- Do you think I picked Dartmouth?

428
00:29:23,228 --> 00:29:26,857
- You didn't pick it?
- No.

429
00:29:26,965 --> 00:29:32,130
- What about Tabby?
- Tabby, she got to go where she wanted.

430
00:29:32,237 --> 00:29:36,503
Sarah Lawrence, six years.

431
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:38,576
She's goin' to grad school, though: Yale.

432
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:43,409
She goes to Yale? Wow.
I didn't think people went to Yale.

433
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:46,814
Well...

434
00:29:46,918 --> 00:29:50,149
she drives off in her car
in September...

435
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:53,747
but for all we know, she pulls over
in Albany and sleeps there until May.

436
00:29:53,858 --> 00:29:55,985
What do you mean?

437
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,494
Joke.
[Makes Nasal Noise]

438
00:29:58,596 --> 00:30:01,087
- That was a joke?
That's what they sound like?
- Yeah.

439
00:30:01,199 --> 00:30:04,760
- For some reason,
I always thought they'd be funnier.
- Well.

440
00:30:04,869 --> 00:30:09,966
- Wait. Isn't Sarah Lawrence
a school for lesbians?
- [Sighs]

441
00:30:10,074 --> 00:30:13,066
How's their football team?

442
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,048
<i>[Woman]</i>
<i>Vermont.</i>

443
00:30:18,149 --> 00:30:20,913
<i>Oh, remember the Milbet's place</i>
<i>in Lake Champlain, darling?</i>

444
00:30:21,019 --> 00:30:25,388
<i>[Mr. Bowland] And what was that</i>
<i>wonderful cheese that we had there?</i>

445
00:30:25,490 --> 00:30:27,890
- Gouda.
- Yes, Gouda.

446
00:30:27,992 --> 00:30:29,892
- Are you sure?
- Yes. Gouda.

447
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:34,658
Anyway, the great thing
about Middlebury is that
the French department is awesome.

448
00:30:34,766 --> 00:30:37,633
French. What are you gonna do
with that? Write poetry?

449
00:30:37,735 --> 00:30:42,695
<i>You know, they predict</i>
<i>China is going to be the largest market</i>
<i>of the 21 st century.</i>

450
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:45,037
Maybe I should take
Chinese, then.

451
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:49,204
Mandarin is the most spoken dialect,
but the Chinese speak
hundreds of distinct languages.

452
00:30:49,314 --> 00:30:52,681
<i>Speaking of which, Tabby,</i>
<i>honey, have you finished</i>
<i>the seating arrangement yet?</i>

453
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:55,685
Mom, can we just talk about
something else for once?

454
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,620
Well, darling, we have to take the list
to the calligrapher.

455
00:31:01,993 --> 00:31:05,827
Mmm. Tabby?

456
00:31:05,930 --> 00:31:09,696
Well, you know, uh...

457
00:31:09,801 --> 00:31:13,328
speaking of calligraphy
and the Chinese...

458
00:31:13,438 --> 00:31:15,633
<i>the...</i>

459
00:31:15,740 --> 00:31:20,700
the Chinese peoples
invented calligraphy.

460
00:31:20,812 --> 00:31:23,042
<i>They did.</i>

461
00:31:23,147 --> 00:31:27,345
But I tend to stray away
from saying "invent" too often...

462
00:31:27,452 --> 00:31:29,716
just because it reinforces
patriarchal stereotypes...

463
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:32,187
<i>as we all know.</i>

464
00:31:34,425 --> 00:31:38,384
Exactly. Men invent,
women give birth.

465
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:43,331
<i>Although, women</i>
<i>invented babies.</i>

466
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:46,426
Right, but babies
gave birth to man.

467
00:31:46,537 --> 00:31:50,337
<i>[All Chuckling]</i>

468
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:52,739
What an unusual conversation.

469
00:31:52,844 --> 00:31:55,438
Do you have discussions like this
at home with your family, Kelly?

470
00:31:55,546 --> 00:31:59,073
My family, uh, they're similar.
A little different.

471

<i>to talk about art.</i>

- Do you?
- You do?

473
00:32:03,821 --> 00:32:07,814
My mother's kind of an artist, so I
pick up very quickly on that kind of stuff.

474
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:10,121
Oh, you come from
a creative family, do you?

475
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:12,287
I do.

476
00:32:12,397 --> 00:32:15,366
<i>Well, I wish I could get my boys</i>
<i>to talk to me about any of my passions.</i>

477
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:17,593
Just try to get them
near the subject of my garden.

478
00:32:17,702 --> 00:32:20,432
- Oh.
- Speaking of, Mrs. Bowland...
