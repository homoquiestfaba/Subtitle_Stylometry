00:02:20,009 --> 00:02:22,316
[man]
You remember the
beginning of the year

4
00:02:22,359 --> 00:02:25,057
when most of you
thought that Japan
was part of Europe?

5
00:02:25,101 --> 00:02:29,192
Well, I wanted to
help foster your new
understanding of the world,

6
00:02:29,236 --> 00:02:33,762
so I came up with
an assignment.

7
00:02:33,805 --> 00:02:36,417
I think you're
gonna like this one.

8
00:02:36,460 --> 00:02:40,421
You're all going to
have to find pen pals.

9
00:02:40,464 --> 00:02:42,901
Doesn't that
sound interesting?

10
00:02:42,945 --> 00:02:45,730
The best way
to find a pen pal

11
00:02:45,774 --> 00:02:49,430
is to look at the classified
section of a magazine
or a newspaper.

12
00:02:49,473 --> 00:02:52,607
Okay, today is
the first of the month.
By this time next month,

13
00:02:52,650 --> 00:02:59,091
I expect you all to
have someone you're
writing to. Okay?

14
00:02:59,135 --> 00:03:04,836
Anita! Would
you care to join
the rest of us?

15
00:03:04,880 --> 00:03:06,751
Hey, sperm babe.

16
00:03:06,795 --> 00:03:09,450
[all laugh]

17
00:03:09,493 --> 00:03:11,016
Anita?

18
00:03:11,060 --> 00:03:15,325
Are you with
us, Anita?

19
00:03:15,369 --> 00:03:18,110
I was just thinking
about pen pals,
Mr. Sheets.

20
00:03:18,154 --> 00:03:20,591
I know what
she's been thinking.

21
00:03:20,635 --> 00:03:23,986
If don't shut your mouth
right now, you're going
to Mr. Fisher's office.

22
00:03:24,029 --> 00:03:25,901
You got that?

23
00:03:31,950 --> 00:03:34,736
[revs engine]

24
00:03:34,779 --> 00:03:39,131
[guys]
Hey, Anita!

25
00:03:39,175 --> 00:03:43,962
C'mon, don't
be like that.

26
00:03:47,488 --> 00:03:50,142
Don't be
mad at us.

27
00:03:50,186 --> 00:03:53,276
C'mon, we're sorry.

28
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:55,191
Let's make it
up to you.

29
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:59,891
You wanna come
for a ride?
Please!

30
00:03:59,935 --> 00:04:03,025
Where you going?

31
00:04:03,068 --> 00:04:06,985
We're just gonna
be driving around.

32
00:04:07,029 --> 00:04:09,814
Come on.

33
00:04:09,858 --> 00:04:15,820
[guys shout]

34
00:04:15,864 --> 00:04:17,082
[laughs]

35
00:04:28,964 --> 00:04:32,184
[howls]
Check it out.
Check out the new moves.

36
00:04:32,228 --> 00:04:34,970
Look out! Stage dive!
Aha!

37
00:04:38,539 --> 00:04:41,759
Check this out.
Check this out.

38
00:04:41,803 --> 00:04:45,372
You ever seen 400 pounds
of flesh splattered
all over a dump.

39
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:49,114
Come on, Anita.

40
00:04:49,158 --> 00:04:51,334
[gunshot]
Ow!

41
00:04:52,901 --> 00:04:54,859
Bill, cut it out!

42
00:04:54,903 --> 00:04:57,079
What's the matter lard ass?

43
00:04:57,122 --> 00:04:59,386
Don't call
me that.

44
00:05:02,084 --> 00:05:05,305
[Tom]
Hey, Anita,
c'mon down here.

45
00:05:05,348 --> 00:05:09,396
Hey, Anita, is it true
you let Joey and Al
do it to you?

46
00:05:09,439 --> 00:05:11,398
What they say?

47
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:13,617
They said you said,
"I believe so."

48
00:05:13,661 --> 00:05:17,708
We know you're pissed off
at us for giving you such
a hard time at school.

49
00:05:17,752 --> 00:05:20,537
But you realize that
in the end, uh, that uh,

50
00:05:20,581 --> 00:05:24,193
We wouldn't be such
dicks about it
if maybe...

51
00:05:24,236 --> 00:05:27,805
...you were, possibly, uh
nice to us,

52
00:05:27,849 --> 00:05:30,460
like you were
nice to Joey
and Butt Head?

53
00:05:30,504 --> 00:05:32,506
[laughs]

54
00:05:32,549 --> 00:05:35,509
Those guys
are fags!

55
00:05:35,552 --> 00:05:38,903
That's why
we're mad at you.

56
00:05:38,947 --> 00:05:40,644
It's only because
we like you.

57
00:05:40,688 --> 00:05:44,213
[laughs]

58
00:05:44,256 --> 00:05:46,389
You guys
really like me?

59
00:05:46,433 --> 00:05:50,088
Anita, of course
we do, Anita.
I'm hurt.

60
00:05:50,132 --> 00:05:56,268
I guess I like
you guys too.

61
00:05:56,312 --> 00:05:58,270
But you promise
not to tell?

62
00:05:58,314 --> 00:06:02,274
We're not gonna tell
no one, Anita.
I promise.

63
00:06:02,318 --> 00:06:05,103
Come on, Anita.

64
00:06:05,147 --> 00:06:07,845
All right.
But not
with him.

65
00:06:07,889 --> 00:06:10,282
Why not?

66
00:06:10,326 --> 00:06:14,896
You better lose some of
that lard if you wanna
party here with Anita.

67
00:06:44,839 --> 00:06:46,841
Where have
you been?

68
00:06:46,884 --> 00:06:49,496
In a place.

69
00:06:52,063 --> 00:06:53,935
Shall I fix dinner?

70
00:06:53,978 --> 00:06:56,677
I ate already.

71
00:06:56,720 --> 00:06:59,157
Now there's
nothing left.

72
00:06:59,201 --> 00:07:02,726
There's some
"yoohoo" left.

73
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:05,337
You mom called
this morning.

74
00:07:05,381 --> 00:07:07,992
What did she say?

75
00:07:08,036 --> 00:07:11,213
Se said, "Hi."

76
00:07:11,256 --> 00:07:13,868
That's it? She didn't
have anything else
to say to me?

77
00:07:13,911 --> 00:07:18,481
She just said she was
having some hassle with
the law over in Fresno.

78
00:07:18,525 --> 00:07:19,830
Fresno?

79
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:22,398
Yeah. She wanted
1,500 bucks.

80
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,228
I told her, "I'm taking care
of your kid. I haven't got 15
bucks let alone 1,500."

81
00:07:26,271 --> 00:07:29,187
Nah, she didn't
say nothing.

82
00:07:29,231 --> 00:07:34,366
Except to start bitching
and saying, "Well, you're
living in my trailer."

83
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:37,326
Blah, blah, blah.

84
00:07:41,286 --> 00:07:44,246
I'm gonna take
a shower.

85
00:07:44,289 --> 00:07:48,555
How about
some company?

86
00:07:48,598 --> 00:07:52,123
I'm really,
tired, Rooney.

Crisson City is
a wonderful place.

"People here
smile a lot,

90
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:30,395
"but I want to get away
as soon as possible
and come to America.

in my foot.

PS. I am 14."

00:09:38,273 --> 00:09:39,579
Good, Jenny.

94
00:09:39,622 --> 00:09:45,585
Then, uh, did you
find a pen pal?

95
00:09:45,628 --> 00:09:47,935
Anita.

96
00:09:47,978 --> 00:09:51,416
Um, mine's not
from Europe
or nothing.

97
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:52,635
It's from California.

98
00:09:52,679 --> 00:09:55,507
Very exotic, Anita.

99
00:09:55,551 --> 00:09:57,858
Anita met a doe.
[laughs]

100
00:09:57,901 --> 00:09:59,337
I wrote him about
a week ago,

101
00:09:59,381 --> 00:10:02,079
and I got a letter
back Saturday.

102
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,742
"Dear Anita.
What a pretty name.

103
00:10:12,786 --> 00:10:14,744
[students laugh]

104
00:10:17,399 --> 00:10:20,663
"My name is Howard,
and I'm 24.

105
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:24,449
"You said you were
interested in how other
people live and stuff.

106
00:10:24,493 --> 00:10:26,887
"Well, life for me
is pretty different

"than anything you've
known, I'm sure.

the stars since I came
to this place.

loud, too.

at night just to
feel the silence.

how to do one thing
good. Shoot guns.

"I always dreamed
of a girl who
liked guns.

Perhaps it was you
I was dreaming of."

117
00:11:01,095 --> 00:11:04,228
May I ask where
your pen pal
resides, Anita?

118
00:11:04,272 --> 00:11:08,929
In goddamn
Sing Sing.

119
00:11:08,972 --> 00:11:11,671
Um, he's a convict
up in Chino.

120
00:11:11,714 --> 00:11:17,241
That really wasn't what I
had in mind when I handed
out the assignment.

121

"I've had no contact
with a woman

your letter,

you and how you look.

feel human again.

so much to have a
picture of yourself.

Or at least a cassette
with your voice."

133
00:11:57,934 --> 00:11:59,675
Hey, Anita.

134
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:02,765
Billy and me are going
down in the dump. You
wanna come along?

135
00:12:02,809 --> 00:12:06,160
No, thanks.

136
00:12:06,203 --> 00:12:07,596
Wait, wait
a second.

137
00:12:07,639 --> 00:12:10,033
Maybe we got something
better to do.

138
00:12:10,077 --> 00:12:12,427
You guys said
you wouldn't tell,
and you told.

139
00:12:12,470 --> 00:12:15,996
You had fun. What's
the big deal? Makin'
like it didn't happen!

140
00:12:16,039 --> 00:12:22,611
Don't bother me
anymore. I have
a boyfriend now.

141
00:12:22,654 --> 00:12:26,310
What--what did you
get? A dog, Anita?

142
00:12:26,354 --> 00:12:27,921
Hey, Joy.

143
00:12:27,964 --> 00:12:30,358
I wouldn't put it
past you if she's
so fuckin' stupid.

144
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:33,970
Hey, don't you guys have
something better to be
doing right now?

145
00:12:34,014 --> 00:12:37,452
Go on, get!

146
00:12:37,495 --> 00:12:40,455
I hate those guys.

147
00:12:40,498 --> 00:12:43,545
Let's get out of here.
This place gives me
the creeps.

Shit!

151
00:13:12,835 --> 00:13:14,402
I'm--

152
00:13:14,445 --> 00:13:16,621
I wanted to take up
shooting guns.

153
00:13:16,665 --> 00:13:21,713
Well, first of all
you're standing wrong.

154
00:13:21,757 --> 00:13:23,977
You stand with
your feet apart.

155
00:13:24,020 --> 00:13:25,500
So far.

156
00:13:25,543 --> 00:13:30,026
Now, get down
on that can and
fire away.

157
00:13:30,070 --> 00:13:32,333
Squeeze it
like it was
a zit.

158
00:13:32,376 --> 00:13:35,771
Slow and easy.

159
00:13:39,122 --> 00:13:42,125
I'm glad you're not
pissed off at me.

160
00:13:42,169 --> 00:13:45,172
No. A woman
oughtta know how
to handle a firearm

161
00:13:45,215 --> 00:13:49,002
so she can protect
herself when a man
is over.

162
00:13:49,045 --> 00:13:50,786
Will you
teach me?

163
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,875
Well, I'm tired
right now,

164
00:13:52,919 --> 00:13:56,618
but we always
got tomorrow.

165
00:13:59,186 --> 00:14:03,320

"Dear Anita, thank you
for the picture you sent me.

166
00:14:03,364 --> 00:14:07,716
"You really are one
of the most beautiful
girls I've ever seen.

167
00:14:07,759 --> 00:14:10,893
"Good news. I did what
they're callin' a "good deed"
around here

168
00:14:10,937 --> 00:14:13,287
and I might parole next
month because of it."

169
00:14:13,330 --> 00:14:17,204
When you gonna let me have a
taste of that...

170
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:19,162
Sally, get back

had a job in some place.

00:15:27,317 --> 00:15:31,365
Hi, Howard.
This is Anita.

180
00:15:31,408 --> 00:15:33,628
Do I sound like you
would thought I would?

181
00:15:33,671 --> 00:15:37,110
And that sure was
the nicest thing
I ever read.

182
00:15:37,153 --> 00:15:39,025
And you said
you loved me.

183
00:15:39,068 --> 00:15:42,593
I love you more than
words could ever know,
my darling.

184
00:15:42,637 --> 00:15:45,683
I think I have an
idea about how to
help you get out.

185
00:15:45,727 --> 00:15:49,209
It would mean that you'd
have to write a letter
sounding religious

186
00:15:49,252 --> 00:15:52,212
so I could give it
to a preacher that
lived nearby,

187
00:15:52,255 --> 00:15:57,130
and you might be
able to get a job
at his gas station.

Um, I'm gonna
go to sleep,

00:16:11,883 --> 00:16:15,757
so I'm gonna
wrap it up now.

192
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:20,240
Sleep tight and

200
00:16:44,829 --> 00:16:46,483

think, Mr. Fulton?

I don't know, Anita.

203
00:16:52,359 --> 00:16:57,886
Don't need any
employees right now.

204
00:16:57,929 --> 00:16:59,540
Sure you do.

205
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:02,195
I mean, there's tons
of chores to be done
around here.

206
00:17:02,238 --> 00:17:04,588
And he could help
with the services.

207
00:17:04,632 --> 00:17:06,112
He's a believer.

208
00:17:06,155 --> 00:17:10,681
You'd be the answer
to his prayers.
And mine, too.

209
00:17:10,725 --> 00:17:13,162
Alright.
I'll tell you
what I'll do.

210
00:17:13,206 --> 00:17:16,600
You can tell him
he can have a job.
Now, you listen to me.

211
00:17:16,644 --> 00:17:18,907
I can't pay him.
All right?

That's all.

In reviewing the events
that brought you here,

218
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:41,843
I can only say that
under normal
circumstances

219
00:17:41,886 --> 00:17:45,803
you wouldn't be
seriously considered
for release at this time.

220
00:17:45,847 --> 00:17:48,719
However, in the light
of your recent actions,

221
00:17:48,763 --> 00:17:51,983
we've taken
another look at
your eligibility.

222
00:17:52,027 --> 00:17:55,639
I understand that some
of the prisoners are
threatening you.

223
00:17:55,683 --> 00:17:59,165
[Howard]
Yes, sir. I'm in a
protected unit at this time.

224

Well, he have a policy
toward convicts that save
one of our staff members

from serious injury.

226
00:18:04,996 --> 00:18:09,958
So, we're granting
you a parole date.

227
00:18:12,265 --> 00:18:14,180
You're a hair
off to the left.

228
00:18:14,223 --> 00:18:17,705
Mine was too small
to adjust with
your hands.

229
00:18:17,748 --> 00:18:20,055
So, step in a
tiny bit here.

230
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:24,015
Line it up
to the right.

231
00:18:24,059 --> 00:18:27,149

doing good, Anita.
You're a natural.

I seem to hit things
better when I don't aim
or think about it, Rooney.

233
00:18:32,067 --> 00:18:33,460
You'd make some
money at this.

Get yourself
in a contest.
Huh?

235

cuban looney toonies
with hard-ons. Get 'em!

[laughs]

237
00:18:42,860 --> 00:18:44,906
And always remember
to put in two shots.

238
00:18:44,949 --> 00:18:50,172
And nobody gonna
argue with you after
you nail 'em twice.

239
00:18:50,216 --> 00:18:55,046
You know, uh, all this
shooting has got me
feeling kinda good.

240
00:18:55,090 --> 00:18:59,268
If you catch
my trip.

241
00:18:59,312 --> 00:19:03,272
What's the matter?

242
00:19:03,316 --> 00:19:04,926
I don't want to no more, Rooney.

243
00:19:04,969 --> 00:19:07,015
You're my mom's
boyfriend.

244
00:19:07,058 --> 00:19:08,886
Ya right!

245
00:19:08,930 --> 00:19:11,628
You know what your
sweet mom, my girl,
is doing up in Fresno?

246
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:13,413
Yeah. She's working
in a restaurant.

247
00:19:13,456 --> 00:19:16,067
She can save enough
money to bring me
out with her.

248
00:19:16,111 --> 00:19:19,288
Yeah? She's out
peddling her ass
for some shitskin pimp

249
00:19:19,332 --> 00:19:22,030
so she can earn
enough money to
shoot heroin in her arm.

250
00:19:22,073 --> 00:19:25,773
Shut the fuck
up, Rooney.

251
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:36,000
Damn you, Anita.
Get your ass
back here.

253
00:19:39,830 --> 00:19:41,441
Don't fuck with me.

Go away!

255
00:19:45,314 --> 00:19:48,491
Goddamn it, Rooney.

256
00:19:50,624 --> 00:19:52,365
All right.

257
00:19:52,408 --> 00:19:54,497
Just hear me, okay?

258
00:19:54,541 --> 00:19:56,847
I don't like
seeing you feel bad.

259
00:19:56,891 --> 00:20:01,330
There comes a time when
you just gotta know
the truth about things.

260
00:20:01,374 --> 00:20:05,639
I don't want to!
I got a boyfriend now.

261
00:20:05,682 --> 00:20:10,034
Yeah, right.
But he's a kid, huh?

262
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:12,559
Kid don't know how
to make a woman
feel happy.

263
00:20:12,602 --> 00:20:15,736
You think I've
been happy here?

264

Get your fucking
hand off my leg!

Stop! No!

No, please!

270
00:20:31,055 --> 00:20:32,970

Hi, Howard.

278
00:21:45,086 --> 00:21:47,915
I am sorry for
getting you up
so early.

279
00:21:47,958 --> 00:21:49,177
It's okay.

280
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:55,705

Well, uh, I made
it for you.

Yeah.

If I give my heart
To you tonight

290
00:22:34,396 --> 00:22:40,359
Will you still
Be by my side

291
00:22:42,143 --> 00:22:46,277
Or will you be gone
With the morning sun

292
00:22:46,321 --> 00:22:47,888
Sure it's pretty
over here.

293
00:22:47,931 --> 00:22:51,152
Yeah, it's really
nice and quiet.

294
00:23:16,307 --> 00:23:20,486
Thank you.

295
00:23:20,529 --> 00:23:22,705
[Mr. Fulton]
There was a lady.

296
00:23:22,749 --> 00:23:24,359
I said there
was a lady.

297
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:27,188
And you could've
taken hot needles.

298
00:23:27,231 --> 00:23:30,496
And you could've pushed
those hot needles right
into her cheeks

299
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:33,455
and she wouldn't
have felt a thing.
Do you know why?

300
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:36,763
[all]
Why?

301
00:23:36,806 --> 00:23:40,462
Because God had
frozen her face!

302
00:23:40,506 --> 00:23:42,899
Hallelujah!
Praise the Lord!

303
00:23:42,943 --> 00:23:46,468
Wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

304

We have ourselves

Praise the Lord.

308
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:06,488
Right there.

309
00:24:06,532 --> 00:24:11,667
Now, do you believe
in the Lord Jesus Christ?

310
00:24:11,711 --> 00:24:13,103
Yes, sir,
I sure do.

311
00:24:13,147 --> 00:24:14,888
Praise the Lord!

312
00:24:14,931 --> 00:24:16,455
[all]
Praise the Lord.

313
00:24:16,498 --> 00:24:22,025
I hope for
your sake, son,
that you mean that.

314
00:24:22,069 --> 00:24:25,202
[all]
Praise the Lord!

315
00:24:25,246 --> 00:24:27,770
Praise the Lord.

[shouts]
Praise the Lord!

317
00:24:36,823 --> 00:24:40,261
Howard, have you been
baptized into the blood
of the Lamb?

318
00:24:40,304 --> 00:24:42,002
I've been baptized.
Yes, sir.

319
00:24:42,045 --> 00:24:44,439
Well, then, you
stretch out your arm.

320
00:24:49,444 --> 00:24:55,494
Praise the Lord!

321
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:57,278
[man]
Praise the Lord!

322
00:24:57,321 --> 00:25:01,848
It's a true test of faith!

323
00:25:01,891 --> 00:25:06,679
Because God spoke
to the serpent

324
00:25:06,722 --> 00:25:11,379
and he said,
"The snake has
beguiled me."

325
00:25:11,422 --> 00:25:17,211
[all]
Hallelujah!

326
00:25:17,254 --> 00:25:21,563
He said, "The snake
hath beguiled me,

327
00:25:21,607 --> 00:25:24,566
and then I
can flourish."
Hallelujah!

328
00:25:24,610 --> 00:25:27,787
Because if you believe,
I mean if you
truly believe

329
00:25:27,830 --> 00:25:30,224
in the power of
the Lord Jesus Christ,

330
00:25:30,267 --> 00:25:33,053
then the serpent
cannot harm you.

331
00:25:33,096 --> 00:25:36,143
And you will have
nothing to fear from
any of these snakes.

332
00:25:36,186 --> 00:25:40,451
Praise the Lord.

333
00:25:40,495 --> 00:25:43,542
I can feel it.
Can you feel that spirit?

334
00:25:43,585 --> 00:25:46,545
I can feel it.
I can feel it!

335
00:25:46,588 --> 00:25:48,590
I can see it!

336
00:25:48,634 --> 00:25:50,592
Praise the Lord!

337

[all cheer]

338
00:25:56,076 --> 00:25:59,819
I can feel that spirit.
I can feel that spirit!

339
00:25:59,862 --> 00:26:03,474
I can feel
that spirit.
Hallelujah!

340
00:26:03,518 --> 00:26:06,652
Praise the Lord!
I can see it,
I can feel it.

341
00:26:06,695 --> 00:26:09,611
Praise the Lord.
Praise the Lord.
Praise the Lord.

342
00:26:09,655 --> 00:26:11,961
Hallelujah!
Praise the Lord.

343
00:26:12,005 --> 00:26:16,313
Praise the Lord.
Praise the Lord.
Hallelujah!

344
00:26:20,927 --> 00:26:23,451
Hallelujah.

345
00:26:23,494 --> 00:26:26,889
Praise the Lord.

346
00:26:26,933 --> 00:26:29,588
Mr. Fulton?
I was wondering

347
00:26:29,631 --> 00:26:32,721
if I could become
a member of your
church, too.

348
00:26:32,765 --> 00:26:35,985
Oh, Anita.
Of course
you can.

349
00:26:36,029 --> 00:26:38,640
We always got room
for one more.

350
00:26:38,684 --> 00:26:40,381
Thanks.

351
00:26:40,424 --> 00:26:44,733
I'm gonna go back
and be with Howard now.

352
00:26:44,777 --> 00:26:46,648
That's all right, honey.

353
00:26:46,692 --> 00:26:51,218
Why don't you just go
home and then you come
back tomorrow, all right?

354
00:26:59,792 --> 00:27:03,230
[Fulton]
So,

355
00:27:03,273 --> 00:27:05,014
how is it
going, Howard?

356
00:27:05,058 --> 00:27:08,061
Well, it startin'
to get to me a
little bit, sir.

357
00:27:08,104 --> 00:27:10,454
Well,

358
00:27:10,498 --> 00:27:14,284
I think that by now
you can call me Hank.

359
00:27:22,379 --> 00:27:25,339
Good old Pee Wee.

360
00:27:25,382 --> 00:27:27,471
Oh!

361
00:27:27,515 --> 00:27:29,169
Oh, that's a
rattlesnake.

362
00:27:29,212 --> 00:27:32,302
Ain't she sweet.

363
00:27:32,346 --> 00:27:34,217
She won't bite, though.

364
00:27:34,261 --> 00:27:35,697
She's been damaged.

365
00:27:35,741 --> 00:27:37,699
I found her out by
the side of the road.

366
00:27:37,743 --> 00:27:41,050
Somebody ran over
her head with a car.

367
00:27:41,094 --> 00:27:44,532
So, she just kinda
lost her natural desire

368
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:49,537
to do anybody
any harm.

369
00:27:49,580 --> 00:27:52,627
What about those
other ones? Been run
over their heads, too?

370
00:27:52,671 --> 00:27:55,238
[grunts]

371
00:27:55,282 --> 00:27:59,503
Well, I kinda
"depoisoned" them

372
00:27:59,547 --> 00:28:02,724
with a potato
scraper.

373
00:28:06,423 --> 00:28:10,297
I don't know Hank.
Seems kind of
dishonest to me.

374
00:28:10,340 --> 00:28:13,692
Well, Howard,
let me tell you.

375
00:28:13,735 --> 00:28:16,607
See these snakes?
Now, they're tools

376
00:28:16,651 --> 00:28:18,305
to bring people into the lord.

377
00:28:18,348 --> 00:28:23,005
How could anything
that does that be
dishonest, huh?

378
00:28:23,049 --> 00:28:26,835
Besides,
I've been bit.

379
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:30,709
And let me tell you
it ain't worth it.

380
00:28:37,019 --> 00:28:39,369
Does Anita live
far from here?

381
00:28:39,413 --> 00:28:44,897
She just lives down
the road with her
mama's boyfriend.

382
00:28:44,940 --> 00:28:48,335
Oh, yeah?
Where's her mama?

383
00:28:48,378 --> 00:28:51,642
You know, I haven't got
the foggiest idea.

384
00:28:51,686 --> 00:28:54,254
She's some kind
of girl, though,
ain't she?

385
00:28:54,297 --> 00:28:55,734
Yeah, sure is.

386
00:28:55,777 --> 00:28:58,475
Yes, sirree.

387
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:00,434
I tell you.

388
00:29:00,477 --> 00:29:03,785
Takes a real special
kind of woman

389
00:29:03,829 --> 00:29:08,790
to go out of her way
for a man like you.

390
00:29:08,834 --> 00:29:11,532
Yeah.

391
00:29:11,575 --> 00:29:13,490
Yeah, I know, sir.

392
00:29:29,637 --> 00:29:33,815
Hi. I've got
something for you.

393
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:36,862
Oh, boy.

394
00:29:36,905 --> 00:29:39,386
Why do think
Hank is trying
to keep us apart?

395
00:29:39,429 --> 00:29:42,824
I mean, I wouldn't
expect him on doing
something like that.

396
00:29:42,868 --> 00:29:45,696
Oh, I think he's just
checking me out,
that's all.

397
00:29:45,740 --> 00:29:47,916
Yeah, I guess.

398
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:50,005
How come you don't
live with your mom?

399
00:29:50,049 --> 00:29:54,531
She's up in Fresno
working so she can
bring me out with her.

400
00:29:54,575 --> 00:29:56,490
So, what do you mean?
You're gonna leave?

401
00:29:56,533 --> 00:29:58,579
[owl hooting]

402
00:29:58,622 --> 00:30:01,277
I'm not going
anywhere.

403
00:30:19,992 --> 00:30:23,517
I could get in so much trouble
just having
these things near me.

404
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:27,129
Don't worry about it.
I remember how you wrote
in your letters

405
00:30:27,173 --> 00:30:30,393
that nine millimeters
were your favorite.

406
00:30:35,746 --> 00:30:38,924
Oh, Jesus!

407
00:30:38,967 --> 00:30:40,664
You didn't tell me
this thing was loaded.

408
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:41,578
[laughs]

409
00:30:41,622 --> 00:30:43,493
I've got plenty
of bullets.

410
00:30:43,537 --> 00:30:45,104
You can't shoot
out here.

411
00:30:45,147 --> 00:30:48,194
Sure you can.
No one can hear us
all the way out here.

412
00:30:48,237 --> 00:30:50,109
Go for it.

413
00:30:50,152 --> 00:30:52,415
Alright, if you say so.

414
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:05,211
Pretty good.

415
00:31:05,254 --> 00:31:07,648
Yeah.

416
00:31:07,691 --> 00:31:10,651
Are you gonna try?

417
00:31:26,623 --> 00:31:29,191
[laughs]

418
00:31:29,235 --> 00:31:30,714
Oh my God!

419
00:31:30,758 --> 00:31:32,542
That's not bad!

420
00:31:32,586 --> 00:31:35,458
You've got a future
if you start doing
a mass murder business.

421
00:31:35,502 --> 00:31:39,680
Well, I don't think
I'll be doing that.

422
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:45,904
[gunshots]

423
00:31:49,995 --> 00:31:53,650
Oh, my God.
Anita! Put your
top on, Jesus!

424
00:31:53,694 --> 00:31:57,176
What's wrong?

425
00:31:57,219 --> 00:32:02,703
Cover yourself up.

426
00:32:02,746 --> 00:32:04,531
I wanted to
make you happy.

427
00:32:04,574 --> 00:32:08,361
Yeah, I know.
Well, it's just
not the way to do it.

428
00:32:16,151 --> 00:32:18,719
What I think is that
these demons right now

429
00:32:18,762 --> 00:32:21,069
are in positions
of power.

430
00:32:21,113 --> 00:32:23,245
In positions of power
in the government

431
00:32:23,289 --> 00:32:26,118
and they control the
Internal Revenue Service.

432
00:32:26,161 --> 00:32:27,467
And they control--

433
00:32:27,510 --> 00:32:29,730
How are you gonna
find 'em all, Hank?

434
00:32:29,773 --> 00:32:32,689
Only one way.

435
00:32:32,733 --> 00:32:36,258
Turning souls
in the right direction.

436
00:32:36,302 --> 00:32:39,783
As many of 'em as we can.

437
00:32:39,827 --> 00:32:41,350
Well, I got one
for you.

438
00:32:41,394 --> 00:32:44,397
How about this?

439
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,836
Now, what if a fella
believes in the Lord

440
00:32:48,879 --> 00:32:52,971
except he's so bad
that he gets sent
to hell anyway, okay?

441
00:32:53,014 --> 00:32:57,149
Now, when he goes
to hell, is the Devil
gonna be hard on him

442
00:32:57,192 --> 00:33:01,980
because he was on
the side of the Lord
when he was living?

443
00:33:02,023 --> 00:33:05,113
Well shoot, Howard.
I don't know.

444
00:33:05,157 --> 00:33:09,074
'Cause I never
thought anything
about that before.

445
00:33:13,730 --> 00:33:15,994
I gotta go.

446
00:33:16,037 --> 00:33:18,344
I'll be back
later, okay?

447
00:33:18,387 --> 00:33:22,826
I just got--
I'll tell you later.

448
00:33:22,870 --> 00:33:24,611
[knocking at door]

449
00:33:24,654 --> 00:33:27,527
The door is open.

450
00:33:31,792 --> 00:33:32,836
Who are you?

451
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:37,580
Howard Hickok.

452
00:33:37,624 --> 00:33:39,408
Two hours late.

453
00:33:39,452 --> 00:33:43,238
I know, sir.
I'm sorry.

454
00:33:43,282 --> 00:33:44,718
Mr. Kincaid.

455
00:33:44,761 --> 00:33:46,067
Have a seat.

456
00:33:46,111 --> 00:33:48,852
I had your file
here a while back.

457
00:33:48,896 --> 00:33:50,724
Here it is.

458
00:33:54,293 --> 00:33:57,861
You did three
years in Chino for
manslaughter.

459
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:06,566
And you did two years
at the Youth Authority
in Camarillo for--

460
00:34:06,609 --> 00:34:08,176
You pistol whipped your father.

461
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,483
How do you feel
about that?

462
00:34:10,526 --> 00:34:15,357
I served my time.
I don't really have to
feel anything about that.

463
00:34:15,401 --> 00:34:19,187
I know you don't
have to feel anything.

464
00:34:20,580 --> 00:34:23,887
The question
is, do you?

465
00:34:23,931 --> 00:34:28,805
Do I feel anything
about that?

466
00:34:28,849 --> 00:34:32,940
Yeah.

467
00:34:32,983 --> 00:34:36,726
the convenience store clerk
that you and your
partner beat to death

468
00:34:36,770 --> 00:34:38,337
feel anything
about that?

469
00:34:38,380 --> 00:34:41,209
That was an accident.
We didn't shoot him
or anything.

470
00:34:41,253 --> 00:34:44,995
I mean, I had
a gun on me.

471
00:34:45,039 --> 00:34:46,997
We didn't rob him
or nothing.

472
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:55,223
You're with Hank Fulton
and his wife?

473
00:34:55,267 --> 00:34:58,444
Yes, sir.
I work in
his garage,

474
00:34:58,487 --> 00:35:01,403
and I help
with the services
as well.

475
00:35:01,447 --> 00:35:03,275
Also I help his wife.

476
00:35:03,318 --> 00:35:06,147
She's doing some planting.
She's got ducks
and whatnot.

477
00:35:06,191 --> 00:35:08,410
I'm pretty busy
right now.

478
00:35:08,454 --> 00:35:10,586
How'd you hook up
with Hank?

479
00:35:10,630 --> 00:35:15,852
Hank heard about me
accepting Jesus Christ
as my personal savior.

480
00:35:18,986 --> 00:35:21,119
That's very admirable.

481
00:35:28,909 --> 00:35:33,783
Howard, what do
you want in life?

482
00:35:33,827 --> 00:35:37,787
Ideally?

483
00:35:37,831 --> 00:35:42,401
Well, ideally I think
I'd like to be a
test shooter

484
00:35:42,444 --> 00:35:46,448
for firearm companies
like Smith and Wesson
or Browning.

485
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:48,146
I don't know,
anyone of those.

486
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:50,713
If I had the money,
I'd go to gunsmithing
school,

487
00:35:50,757 --> 00:35:54,195
but I think at this point
it would be better for me
if I was a test shooter.

488
00:35:54,239 --> 00:35:56,154
All right.

489
00:35:56,197 --> 00:35:58,460
Nobody's gonna hire
you to shoot guns.

490
00:35:58,504 --> 00:36:01,202
Why not? All those
companies have
test shooters.

491
00:36:01,246 --> 00:36:03,248
Down to earth.

492
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:07,817
We're talking about
you, Howard Hickok.
Parolee.

493
00:36:12,996 --> 00:36:14,868
What are you
doing here?

494
00:36:14,911 --> 00:36:16,870
Hi!

495
00:36:16,913 --> 00:36:19,177
My boyfriend's got
an appointment.

496
00:36:19,220 --> 00:36:22,876
Your boyfriend's
in with my dad?

497
00:36:22,919 --> 00:36:24,399
I'm embarrassed.

498
00:36:24,443 --> 00:36:28,098
Oh, boy, Anita!
So, where were
you last week?

499
00:36:28,142 --> 00:36:29,796
Did you quit
school or something?

500
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:32,015
Yeah, I'm all
finished with that.

501
00:36:32,059 --> 00:36:35,715
[Mr. Kincaid]
Joy.

502
00:36:35,758 --> 00:36:39,632
Joy, this is the guy
I was telling you about.
This is Howard.

503
00:36:39,675 --> 00:36:41,155
Hi, Howard.
I'm Joy.

504
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:42,809
Joy, what are
you doing here?

505
00:36:42,852 --> 00:36:45,420
I need my
allowance, Daddy.

506
00:36:45,464 --> 00:36:47,988
So, what are you guys
doing right now?

507
00:36:48,031 --> 00:36:49,207
I don't know.

508
00:36:49,250 --> 00:36:51,513
I need you here.

509
00:36:51,557 --> 00:36:53,863
Well, maybe
some other time.

510
00:36:53,907 --> 00:36:57,040
Howard?
Same time
next week.

511
00:36:57,084 --> 00:36:58,955
Don't be late.

512
00:36:58,999 --> 00:37:01,131
Bye, Anita.

513
00:37:05,397 --> 00:37:07,660
I want you to stay away
from those two.

514
00:37:07,703 --> 00:37:10,053
I've known Anita since
I was a little girl.

515
00:37:10,097 --> 00:37:14,014
Well, it's about time
you two parted company.

516
00:37:14,057 --> 00:37:16,495
Daddy, she's
totally harmless.

517
00:37:16,538 --> 00:37:18,323
She's my friend.

518
00:37:18,366 --> 00:37:21,587
I'm not talking about
the girl. I'm talking
about her boyfriend.

519
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:24,851
I can't imagine what
was going through the
parole board's mind

520
00:37:24,894 --> 00:37:27,984
when they let
this one out.

521
00:37:28,028 --> 00:37:32,728
You can trust me.
I know what I'm
talking about.

522
00:37:32,772 --> 00:37:35,078
I think you're
overreacting.

523
00:37:35,122 --> 00:37:36,776
[clears throat]

524
00:37:36,819 --> 00:37:39,300
Look, just stay
away from them.

525
00:37:39,344 --> 00:37:43,043
Can you do that
for me, huh?

526
00:37:43,086 --> 00:37:44,000
Yeah.
Sure, Daddy.

527
00:37:44,044 --> 00:37:45,567
Promise?

528
00:37:45,611 --> 00:37:47,265
I promise.

529
00:37:47,308 --> 00:37:50,137
Get out of here.

530
00:37:53,532 --> 00:37:56,883
What do you think?

531
00:37:56,926 --> 00:37:59,364
I don't know,
Anita.

532
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:09,287
Are you guys okay?
You need a lift?

533
00:38:09,330 --> 00:38:13,073
Yeah!

534
00:38:13,116 --> 00:38:15,684
[Joy]
Howard, could you grab me
one of those beers

535
00:38:15,728 --> 00:38:17,643
under your seat
right there?

536
00:38:24,171 --> 00:38:25,999
[Howard]
Say, eh, Joy?

537
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:29,002
Didn't your dad tell
you he didn't want you
hanging out with us?

538
00:38:29,045 --> 00:38:32,048
He sure did!

539
00:38:32,092 --> 00:38:34,921
Told ya
I was trouble.
Didn't he?

540
00:38:34,964 --> 00:38:37,880
Well, I figured
that out myself.

541
00:38:37,924 --> 00:38:40,970
Or else why would
you be seeing my dad?

542
00:38:41,014 --> 00:38:43,059
See I told you
he didn't like me.

543
00:38:43,103 --> 00:38:47,977
Hey, bad boy, would
you pass me that?

544
00:38:50,284 --> 00:38:55,637
So, are you diggin'
the sights since
you've been to Helm?

545
00:38:55,681 --> 00:38:58,510
There's, uh, there's
always the drive-in
movie theater

546
00:38:58,553 --> 00:39:00,381
that's been closed
for ten years.

547
00:39:00,425 --> 00:39:03,341
Or there's
always the dump.

548
00:39:03,384 --> 00:39:05,908
Every bad thing
I ever did,

549
00:39:05,952 --> 00:39:08,084
I did there first.

550
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:13,873
Do you wanna come in?

551
00:39:13,916 --> 00:39:15,570
Yeah, why don't you come in?

552
00:39:18,225 --> 00:39:20,140
Okay.

553
00:39:36,417 --> 00:39:37,853
This is nice!

554
00:39:37,897 --> 00:39:38,941
Do you like?

555
00:39:38,985 --> 00:39:40,378
Yeah, it's
really sweet.

556
00:39:40,421 --> 00:39:43,250
I've been sort
of redecorating.

557
00:39:43,293 --> 00:39:44,860
Do you guys
want some water?

558
00:39:44,904 --> 00:39:46,471
You got
anymore beer?

559
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:49,778
No. But I got this.

560
00:39:49,822 --> 00:39:53,129
[screams]

561
00:39:53,173 --> 00:39:54,261
Do you want some?

562
00:39:54,304 --> 00:39:55,175
You gotta ask?

563
00:39:55,218 --> 00:39:58,134
No.
Here.

564
00:39:58,178 --> 00:40:00,441
Okay so,

565
00:40:00,485 --> 00:40:02,225
what do you think of him?

566
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:04,010
He's really cute!

567
00:40:04,053 --> 00:40:07,187
He's cute,
isn't he?

568
00:40:09,363 --> 00:40:12,105
[coughs]

569
00:40:12,148 --> 00:40:15,500
I'm gonna put
some music on.

570
00:40:22,724 --> 00:40:25,423
Do you remember
that dance we did
a couple of years ago?

571
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:28,251
Oh, Yeah!
Yes, I do.

572
00:40:28,295 --> 00:40:30,079
Do you wanna
do it?

573
00:40:30,123 --> 00:40:31,951
Okay.

574
00:40:31,994 --> 00:40:36,303
We're gonna do
this dance.

575
00:40:36,346 --> 00:40:37,522
Okay.

576
00:40:37,565 --> 00:40:40,133
One--
All right.

577
00:40:40,176 --> 00:40:44,267
One--

578
00:40:46,748 --> 00:40:51,144
One, two, three.

579
00:40:51,187 --> 00:40:53,668
One, two,
three, four.

580
00:41:03,548 --> 00:41:07,552
[music from trailer]

581
00:41:10,729 --> 00:41:13,775
[both laugh]

582
00:41:23,045 --> 00:41:26,266
Mr. Kincaid!

583
00:41:26,309 --> 00:41:27,920
Joy what are you
doing here?

584
00:41:27,963 --> 00:41:32,141
Their truck broke
down, so I drove
them here, Daddy.

585
00:41:36,319 --> 00:41:38,887
You go home.
Now.

586
00:41:38,931 --> 00:41:41,324
I'll talk to you later.

587
00:41:41,368 --> 00:41:43,022
[door closes]

588
00:41:50,420 --> 00:41:51,857
What the hell's
going on here?

589
00:41:51,900 --> 00:41:53,554
Nothing,
Mr. Kincaid.

590
00:41:53,598 --> 00:41:58,211
Yeah?
Get up.
Turn around.

591
00:41:58,254 --> 00:42:00,822
You got no
business here,
you understand?

592
00:42:00,866 --> 00:42:05,523
No business being
in the home of a
female minor.

593
00:42:08,308 --> 00:42:10,266
I was just
here visiting
Anita, sir.

594
00:42:10,310 --> 00:42:12,138
We weren't
doing anything.

595
00:42:12,181 --> 00:42:14,357
You're talking to us
like we're trash.

596
00:42:14,401 --> 00:42:15,881
I know about you.

597
00:42:15,924 --> 00:42:18,666
Put out for anything
in pants.

598
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:23,279
As far as I'm concerned,
you're both trash.

599
00:42:23,323 --> 00:42:24,324
You got that?

600
00:42:24,367 --> 00:42:25,586
Yeah.

601
00:42:25,630 --> 00:42:27,327
You hear me?

602
00:42:27,370 --> 00:42:29,459
Yeah, I hear you.

603
00:42:34,160 --> 00:42:36,249
Stay away
from my daughter.

604
00:42:36,292 --> 00:42:39,165
[door is opened]

605
00:42:43,909 --> 00:42:47,782
Well, I guess your
parole officer doesn't
like you after all.

606
00:42:52,439 --> 00:42:53,571
Anita, this ain't funny.

607
00:42:53,614 --> 00:42:55,311
I'm sorry.

608
00:43:07,628 --> 00:43:09,499
Not bad.

609
00:43:09,543 --> 00:43:11,414
Not bad at all.

610
00:43:28,475 --> 00:43:32,044
[Howard]
You aren't mad,
are you?

611
00:43:32,087 --> 00:43:36,614
I'm not mad.

612
00:43:36,657 --> 00:43:42,097
It's just I don't think
we oughtta be into
sex just yet.

613
00:43:42,141 --> 00:43:44,534
It's okay.

614
00:43:47,799 --> 00:43:50,192
You could still come
in my mouth.

615
00:43:50,236 --> 00:43:53,718
Oh, Anita, Jesus!

616
00:43:55,676 --> 00:43:59,332
That ain't
sex so much.

617
00:44:02,291 --> 00:44:06,426
Besides, I thought
that's what you wanted.

618
00:44:06,469 --> 00:44:09,429
That's all guys ever want.

619
00:44:09,472 --> 00:44:12,475
I don't know
about that.

620
00:44:12,519 --> 00:44:15,914
Sounds to me like you've
been hanging out with a
bunch of sex maniacs.

621
00:44:15,957 --> 00:44:18,046
[Hank]
Hey!

622
00:44:18,090 --> 00:44:21,093
You two get your
clothes on.

623
00:44:26,925 --> 00:44:28,491
Decent yet?

624
00:44:28,535 --> 00:44:33,061
No.

625
00:44:33,105 --> 00:44:35,847
What're all those guns
doing layin' all
over the place?

626
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:37,718
This is where I
shoot, Mr. Fulton.

627
00:44:37,762 --> 00:44:40,765
It seems like a pretty
funny thing for a girl
to be doing

628
00:44:40,808 --> 00:44:46,074
without any clothes
on, don't it?

629
00:44:46,118 --> 00:44:51,079
As for you, Howard,

630
00:44:51,123 --> 00:44:53,865
if I'd known you were
gonna be fooling
around like this,

631
00:44:53,908 --> 00:44:58,260
I'd never would've
let you stay here.

632
00:44:58,304 --> 00:45:00,523
We weren't doing
anything, Mr. Fulton.

633
00:45:00,567 --> 00:45:03,048
You go on back
to the house, Anita.

634
00:45:03,091 --> 00:45:06,747
Howard and me
got some talkin'
to do man to man.

635
00:45:12,318 --> 00:45:16,409
I saw you. You were
fornicating her.

636
00:45:16,452 --> 00:45:19,064
No, I wasn't.
I was not.

637
00:45:19,107 --> 00:45:22,632
I'm not stupid, Howard.
I can see what's
going on.

638
00:45:22,676 --> 00:45:24,896
All I got to do
is take one little
look at her.

639
00:45:24,939 --> 00:45:27,202
I can see that
she's come of age.

640
00:45:27,246 --> 00:45:30,423
She's all pink
and juicy.

641
00:45:30,466 --> 00:45:33,905
Remember, I used
to be a farmer.

642
00:45:33,948 --> 00:45:37,517
Look, Hank,

643
00:45:37,560 --> 00:45:38,692
I love her.

644
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,260
That ain't
the point, Howard.

645
00:45:41,303 --> 00:45:44,176
Listen to me.
And you listen
real good,

646
00:45:44,219 --> 00:45:47,614
'cause I'm gonna
give you a couple
choices here.

647
00:45:51,879 --> 00:45:54,795
Don't worry.
Maybe I could
talk to him.

648
00:46:06,067 --> 00:46:07,808
[Hank]
Come on
in the house.

649
00:46:07,852 --> 00:46:10,593
Anita, you and Howard
got some personal stuff

650
00:46:10,637 --> 00:46:12,291
that you need
to be talking about.

651
00:46:12,334 --> 00:46:15,816
[door is closed]

652
00:46:15,860 --> 00:46:19,602
Hank says

653
00:46:19,646 --> 00:46:22,301
I have to stop
seeing you

654
00:46:22,344 --> 00:46:28,698
or we can't
get married.

655
00:46:28,742 --> 00:46:32,920
Mr. Fulton?

656
00:46:32,964 --> 00:46:36,663
Can I be getting married?
I mean, I'm a minor. Don't
I need permission?

657
00:46:36,706 --> 00:46:40,319
How about Rooney?

658
00:46:40,362 --> 00:46:43,191
Well, he wouldn't have
much to say about it.

659
00:46:43,235 --> 00:46:46,586
Besides, he took off a
month ago and he hasn't
been back since.

660
00:46:46,629 --> 00:46:50,503
Where would he go?

661
00:46:50,546 --> 00:46:53,549
If you're old enough
to be doing what
you've been doing,

662
00:46:53,593 --> 00:46:56,683
you are old enough
to be gettin' married.
And you listen to me.

663
00:46:56,726 --> 00:47:01,383
'Cause Howard cannot
afford to be caught doing
the dirty with a minor

664
00:47:01,427 --> 00:47:06,345
that is not his wife.

665
00:47:06,388 --> 00:47:10,001
Well.

666
00:47:10,044 --> 00:47:12,655
Would you
marry us, then?

667
00:47:12,699 --> 00:47:16,703
Anita, do you promise
God that you're gonna
love Howard

668
00:47:16,746 --> 00:47:20,446
whether he's sick
or he's well?

669
00:47:20,489 --> 00:47:21,621
I do.

670
00:47:21,664 --> 00:47:23,666
Okay.

671
00:47:23,710 --> 00:47:28,193
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

672
00:47:28,236 --> 00:47:31,022
Well, now you can
kiss the bride, Howard.

673
00:47:42,772 --> 00:47:47,647
I'm sorry.

674
00:47:47,690 --> 00:47:50,084
I'm sorry

675
00:47:50,128 --> 00:47:56,569
that I couldn't
consummate our
wedding night.

676
00:47:56,612 --> 00:47:59,964
I guess this is just
gonna have to happen
some time.

677
00:48:04,403 --> 00:48:09,538
It's okay.

678
00:48:09,582 --> 00:48:14,587
There's other ways
for people in love
to get together.

679
00:48:14,630 --> 00:48:17,285
Without having sex?

680
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:23,857
Yeah.

681
00:48:23,901 --> 00:48:27,469
Like to tell each other
our deepest secrets.

682
00:48:41,440 --> 00:48:44,617
[whispers]
I don't think you'll
wanna know my secrets.

683
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:47,620
Yes, I do.

684
00:48:47,663 --> 00:48:53,017
I don't want us
to hold anything
back from each other.

685
00:48:53,060 --> 00:48:59,371
You're right.

686
00:48:59,414 --> 00:49:03,636
I've never been
with a woman before.

687
00:49:03,679 --> 00:49:07,727
That's a secret.

688
00:49:07,770 --> 00:49:10,904
I mean, I've never
been able to--

689
00:49:10,948 --> 00:49:14,864
you know.

690
00:49:14,908 --> 00:49:17,215
It seems like
every time

691
00:49:17,258 --> 00:49:23,917
I'm with a
beautiful woman,

692
00:49:23,961 --> 00:49:27,660
I just feel like
I'm gonna lose it.

693
00:49:34,406 --> 00:49:38,018
Come on, Howard.

694
00:49:38,062 --> 00:49:39,019
Where're you going?

695
00:50:04,044 --> 00:50:07,613
I'm gonna consummate
for you now.

696
00:50:14,837 --> 00:50:18,667
Close it!
Close it!

697
00:50:19,973 --> 00:50:23,150
Who is that?

698
00:50:23,194 --> 00:50:25,631
Rooney.

699
00:50:25,674 --> 00:50:30,375
He's my mother's
boyfriend.

700
00:50:30,418 --> 00:50:33,987
He tried to take me
against my will.

701
00:50:34,031 --> 00:50:39,688
So he--
He did?

702
00:50:41,342 --> 00:50:45,738
You did the
right thing.
All right?

703
00:50:45,781 --> 00:50:50,786
But, Anita, you can't
just leave him
here like this.

704
00:50:50,830 --> 00:50:53,702
I mean, it's like
having a time bomb
on your back yard.

705
00:50:53,746 --> 00:50:57,663
We have to bury him
or get rid of him
or something.

706
00:50:57,706 --> 00:51:02,798
Well, there's a furnace
about a mile away.

707
00:51:02,842 --> 00:51:06,411
All right. That's
even better.

708
00:51:06,454 --> 00:51:09,153
You go get
a sheet.

709
00:51:09,196 --> 00:51:11,633
I'll get him out.

710
00:51:11,677 --> 00:51:15,724
Hey, don't worry.
It's gonna be
all right.

711
00:51:15,768 --> 00:51:18,075
I love you.
I love you.

712
00:51:18,118 --> 00:51:19,598
Really?

713
00:51:19,641 --> 00:51:20,947
Really.

714
00:51:20,990 --> 00:51:26,083
Hurry up.
We gotta do this
quick. All right?

715
00:51:26,126 --> 00:51:28,563
Shit.

716
00:51:49,671 --> 00:51:55,590
Come on up here, baby,
and give me a hand.

717
00:51:55,634 --> 00:51:58,419
Get the feet.

718
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:09,169
Are you okay?

719
00:52:09,213 --> 00:52:10,475
[shouts]

720
00:52:10,518 --> 00:52:12,085
What's the matter?

721
00:52:12,129 --> 00:52:14,435
It's burst.

722
00:52:14,479 --> 00:52:15,654
Get his other arm.

723
00:52:15,697 --> 00:52:18,135
I got it.

724
00:52:24,010 --> 00:52:25,142
It's heavy.

725
00:52:25,185 --> 00:52:27,187
Yeah.

726
00:52:30,321 --> 00:52:32,845
Yeah, one more.
We're almost there.

727
00:52:37,937 --> 00:52:40,069
It's all right.

728
00:52:40,113 --> 00:52:41,027
He's heavy.

729
00:52:41,070 --> 00:52:42,985
He's so heavy.

730
00:52:43,029 --> 00:52:45,858
Ready?
One.

731
00:52:45,901 --> 00:52:47,294
Two, three.

732
00:52:47,338 --> 00:52:52,038
[shouts]

733
00:52:55,824 --> 00:52:57,348
You wanna say
a few words?

734
00:52:57,391 --> 00:53:03,005
I know he was a bastard,
but it's a Christian
thing to do.

735
00:53:06,400 --> 00:53:08,837
Okay.

736
00:53:10,361 --> 00:53:13,059
Here lies a pig.

737
00:53:13,102 --> 00:53:17,194
May he roast in hell
for all eternity.

738
00:53:24,113 --> 00:53:28,422
Howard? I don't care
if we ever do sex.

739
00:53:28,466 --> 00:53:32,209
It's nothing
special to me.

740
00:53:32,252 --> 00:53:38,345
And I never could
understand why they
call it "making love."

741
00:53:38,389 --> 00:53:42,958
Always made me
wanna throw up.

742
00:53:43,002 --> 00:53:47,615
And you not wanting it,
and still wanting me

743
00:53:47,659 --> 00:53:51,402
just makes me
love you more.

744
00:53:51,445 --> 00:53:54,448
You've been with
a lot of guys?

745
00:54:03,849 --> 00:54:06,504
Every man
I've ever known
since I was nine,

746
00:54:06,547 --> 00:54:09,942
has wanted the
same thing of me.

747
00:54:12,684 --> 00:54:18,777
I never felt nothing
for a single one
of them.

748
00:54:18,820 --> 00:54:21,997
Then I started
reading your letters.

749
00:54:22,041 --> 00:54:26,567
And I started standing
up for myself for
the first time.

750
00:54:26,611 --> 00:54:28,917
You gave me that.

751
00:54:28,961 --> 00:54:34,140
You made me free.

752
00:54:34,183 --> 00:54:37,970
If anybody tries
to make me do what
I don't wanna do,

753
00:54:38,013 --> 00:54:40,015
they're gonna end
up like Rooney.

754
00:54:45,717 --> 00:54:50,287
Look at me, Howard.

755
00:54:50,330 --> 00:54:53,638
I love you.

756
00:54:53,681 --> 00:54:56,945
I don't care
what you've done.

757
00:54:56,989 --> 00:55:01,863
Don't start thinking
about what I've done.

758
00:55:01,907 --> 00:55:04,692
We're in a
new life now.

759
00:55:04,736 --> 00:55:06,868
[rock music from car]

760
00:55:06,912 --> 00:55:10,742
[revs engine]

761
00:55:17,009 --> 00:55:21,535
Hey, Anita!

762
00:55:21,579 --> 00:55:23,320
You turned up.

763
00:55:23,363 --> 00:55:24,973
Show him.

764
00:55:25,017 --> 00:55:26,584
This is very bad.

765
00:55:26,627 --> 00:55:28,368
What's bad?

766
00:55:28,412 --> 00:55:32,372
You bad?

767
00:55:32,416 --> 00:55:34,374
You don't know.

768
00:55:34,418 --> 00:55:37,464
You boys oughtta go
home. You shouldn't
come up here.

769
00:55:37,508 --> 00:55:40,554
Why's that?

770
00:55:40,598 --> 00:55:45,211
What's going on?
You guys having
a barbecue?

771
00:55:45,254 --> 00:55:50,477
With that face
he couldn't rock.

772
00:55:50,521 --> 00:55:52,436
Okay, who's
gonna go first?

773
00:55:52,479 --> 00:55:55,090
I say it's three
on one, man, but
we gotta flip a coin.

774
00:55:55,134 --> 00:55:56,396
I'm first.

775
00:55:56,440 --> 00:55:59,486
I'm gonna ask you
one more time.

776
00:55:59,530 --> 00:56:02,097
Please, get
in that car
and go home.

777
00:56:02,141 --> 00:56:04,361
I don't think so.
I'm sorry, man.

778
00:56:04,404 --> 00:56:07,233
This is where
Anita takes all
her boyfriends.

779
00:56:07,276 --> 00:56:09,670
You saying you're
her boyfriend?

780
00:56:09,714 --> 00:56:13,631
No, her girlfriend.

781
00:56:13,674 --> 00:56:17,243
We're saying
everybody is
her boyfriend.

782
00:56:17,286 --> 00:56:20,899
I think I want you
to apologize first
before you go home.

783
00:56:20,942 --> 00:56:23,423
To Anita?

784
00:56:23,467 --> 00:56:26,295
Anita, who is
this joker?

785
00:56:26,339 --> 00:56:30,561
Howard, please.
Please.

786
00:56:36,654 --> 00:56:38,612
Get in the
fucking car, son!

787
00:56:38,656 --> 00:56:41,441
You better both go
home. You want some
of this, junior?

788
00:56:41,485 --> 00:56:45,402
Huh?

789
00:56:45,445 --> 00:56:47,969
Yeah.

790
00:56:48,013 --> 00:56:53,366
Anita! For Christ
sake, look what
you made me do!

791
00:56:53,410 --> 00:56:57,022
He needs
a hospital
now! Shit!

792
00:56:57,065 --> 00:56:58,937
Damn it!

793
00:56:58,980 --> 00:57:00,852
What am I gonna
do with him now?

794
00:57:00,895 --> 00:57:02,157
I can't just leave him
here bleeding like that

795
00:57:02,201 --> 00:57:05,117
with this other one
knowing about it.

796
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:07,206
Hey, Anita.

797
00:57:07,249 --> 00:57:09,251
You better not let
this guy do this.

798
00:57:09,295 --> 00:57:12,994
Can't we think of
something else, please?

799
00:57:13,038 --> 00:57:16,433
[grunts]

800
00:57:23,527 --> 00:57:26,617
Look out!

801
00:57:26,660 --> 00:57:28,053
Oh, fuck!

802
00:57:28,096 --> 00:57:31,012
Jesus Christ!

803
00:57:31,056 --> 00:57:35,103
Why the hell didn't
you just listen to me?

804
00:57:44,809 --> 00:57:47,942
Get down, son.

805
00:57:47,986 --> 00:57:52,860
Anita!

806
00:57:52,904 --> 00:57:55,863
I'm sorry, son.

807
00:57:55,907 --> 00:58:00,999
You gonna
have to die.

808
00:58:01,042 --> 00:58:03,392
It'll be okay, Tom.

809
00:58:03,436 --> 00:58:06,961
Just think
about Jesus.

810
00:58:07,005 --> 00:58:10,138
[gunshot]

811
00:58:28,330 --> 00:58:31,333
[whispers]
Oh, shit.

812
00:58:31,377 --> 00:58:35,337
I can't
get it started.

813
00:58:35,381 --> 00:58:38,645
Shit.
All right,
hang on.

814
00:58:38,689 --> 00:58:41,343
Try it again.

815
00:58:41,387 --> 00:58:42,997
Shit.

816
00:58:43,041 --> 00:58:46,697
It won't start.

817
00:58:46,740 --> 00:58:49,308
What do we do?
I mean, we can't
leave the car here.

818
00:58:49,351 --> 00:58:53,225
We leave the car here,
then they'll know and
they'll catch us. We can't--

819
00:58:53,268 --> 00:58:56,358
Anita, calm down, baby!

820
00:58:56,402 --> 00:58:59,492
Uh, let me think.

821
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:01,015
Right. Go get
their car.

822
00:59:01,059 --> 00:59:03,148
I'm gonna
take care of
all of this.

823
00:59:03,191 --> 00:59:05,498
Hurry up.

824
00:59:51,109 --> 00:59:52,893
[Anita]
What if we get caught?

825
00:59:52,937 --> 00:59:56,636
[Howard]
Well, I'd get fired
for sure.

826
00:59:56,680 --> 01:00:00,422
Anita, you might get
off being as young
as you are.

827
01:00:00,466 --> 01:00:03,730
I don't think I'll
get that same
deal, though.

828
01:00:03,774 --> 01:00:06,385
But if you told 'em

829
01:00:06,428 --> 01:00:10,911
that I made you
do some of those
terrible things.

830
01:00:10,955 --> 01:00:12,870
I couldn't do that.

831
01:00:12,913 --> 01:00:14,915
Oh, sure you could.

832
01:00:14,959 --> 01:00:17,439
I couldn't do it.

833
01:00:17,483 --> 01:00:19,441
You'd better.

834
01:00:19,485 --> 01:00:22,096
Or I'll come back
and bite your
little butt off.

835
01:00:22,140 --> 01:00:27,536
[chuckles]

836
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:32,367
You know,

837
01:00:32,411 --> 01:00:38,069
doing these
things together,

838
01:00:38,112 --> 01:00:43,596
I feel so
close to you.

839
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,686
You know, Howard?

840
01:00:46,730 --> 01:00:49,471
Ever since I got
your first letter,

841
01:00:49,515 --> 01:00:52,518
I've been feeling
close like this to you.

842
01:00:57,001 --> 01:01:00,831
I swear sometimes
I feel like one of
the luckiest guys

843
01:01:00,874 --> 01:01:03,485
in the whole
wide world.

844
01:01:30,861 --> 01:01:34,386
Met a stranger
On a train

845
01:01:34,429 --> 01:01:38,520
He bumped
Right into me

846
01:01:38,564 --> 01:01:42,437
I swear I
Didn't mean it

847
01:01:42,481 --> 01:01:46,572
I swear it wasn't
Meant to be

848
01:01:46,615 --> 01:01:50,402
Must a been a dream

849
01:01:50,445 --> 01:01:54,232
From a thousand
Years ago

850
01:01:54,275 --> 01:01:57,931
I swear I
Didn't mean it

851
01:01:57,975 --> 01:02:02,109
I swear it wasn't
Meant to be

852
01:02:02,153 --> 01:02:04,198
From the bottom
Of my heart

853
01:02:04,242 --> 01:02:07,898
[Hank]
What happens
if a Christian

854
01:02:07,941 --> 01:02:13,991
yearned his
whole life
for Heaven,

855
01:02:14,034 --> 01:02:17,124
and then at the last
second he's committed
some kind of sin

856
01:02:17,168 --> 01:02:21,563
that's damned
himself to hell?

857
01:02:21,607 --> 01:02:24,479
Now, does

858
01:02:24,523 --> 01:02:28,832
Satan hold this
against him

859
01:02:28,875 --> 01:02:34,794
when he's finally
in that dark one's power?

860
01:02:37,492 --> 01:02:40,539
Where are
my glasses?

861
01:02:41,670 --> 01:02:43,237
[rattling]

862
01:02:43,281 --> 01:02:45,631
Hey!

863
01:02:45,674 --> 01:02:51,115
Hey, Pee Wee!

864
01:02:51,158 --> 01:02:55,554
What's the matter, huh?

865
01:02:55,597 --> 01:02:57,556
You don't look
so good, do you?

866
01:02:57,599 --> 01:03:00,515
Oh, I have to--

867
01:03:00,559 --> 01:03:02,866
Have to send you
to the vet.

868
01:03:02,909 --> 01:03:04,563
[rattling]

869
01:03:04,606 --> 01:03:06,130
Ah!

870
01:03:06,173 --> 01:03:12,092
Pee Wee!
Damn, you
piece of shit.

871
01:03:23,887 --> 01:03:27,107
Howard?

872
01:03:27,151 --> 01:03:29,588
Anita is here
to contain me.

873
01:03:29,631 --> 01:03:31,633
I heard what happened.
How is he doing?

874
01:03:31,677 --> 01:03:37,291
Well, I guess he's been
bitten before, so he's
kinda built up immunity.

875
01:03:37,335 --> 01:03:42,383
Howard, I'd like
to speak to you in
private. Outside.

876
01:03:50,565 --> 01:03:53,394
[Mr. Kincaid]
I'm gonna give it to
you straight, Howard.

877
01:03:53,438 --> 01:03:55,744
Placing you with
Hank Fulton was
a big mistake.

878
01:03:55,788 --> 01:04:00,532
He's a good mechanical.
I know he's just
a bit crazy.

879
01:04:00,575 --> 01:04:04,057
This is only gonna be
a temporary thing, so
don't get overly upset.

880
01:04:04,101 --> 01:04:06,712
It'll benefit
you in the long.

881
01:04:06,755 --> 01:04:08,540
Are you gonna
send me back
to prison?

882
01:04:08,583 --> 01:04:10,455
No, not prison.
County jail

883
01:04:10,498 --> 01:04:14,241
until I can place you
somewhere more healthy.

884
01:04:14,285 --> 01:04:16,678
Mr. Kincaid,
I'm married now.

885
01:04:16,722 --> 01:04:18,332
To Anita Minteer?

886
01:04:18,376 --> 01:04:20,552
Yes, sir. I got
responsibilities.

887
01:04:20,595 --> 01:04:22,597
I'm trying to walk
the walk here.

888
01:04:22,641 --> 01:04:24,643
I think we better
talk with my wife.

889
01:04:24,686 --> 01:04:26,427
I gotta frisk you, Howard,
turn around.

890
01:04:26,471 --> 01:04:28,777
You just look
for any excuse,
don't you, Kincaid?

891
01:04:28,821 --> 01:04:30,779
Be a man,
Howard.

892
01:04:30,823 --> 01:04:32,607
Trouble?

893
01:04:32,651 --> 01:04:35,784
No, John, but I'd
appreciate it if
you stood by.

894
01:04:35,828 --> 01:04:40,485
You're being such
a dick about this,
Kincaid.

895
01:04:40,528 --> 01:04:43,880
John, he's a parolee
in direct disobedience
to an officer of the law.

896
01:04:43,923 --> 01:04:45,664
Take him
into custody.

897
01:04:45,707 --> 01:04:49,711
Come on, son.
Don't make it any harder on you
than it already is.

898
01:04:53,106 --> 01:04:55,630
[John]
He's got a gun!

899
01:04:55,674 --> 01:04:59,547
[Howard]
Anita!

900
01:04:59,591 --> 01:05:03,073
What is he
hollering about?

901
01:05:20,829 --> 01:05:22,701
Anita!
We gotta get
outta here, baby!

902
01:05:22,744 --> 01:05:27,793
All right.
Howard!

903
01:05:27,836 --> 01:05:30,970
My God.

904
01:05:31,014 --> 01:05:34,495
Over here.
Go.

905
01:05:40,414 --> 01:05:42,112
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

906
01:05:42,155 --> 01:05:43,983
[Kincaid]
Give it up, Howard.

907
01:05:44,027 --> 01:05:47,073
Back off.
Put those hands up
where I can see them.

908
01:05:47,117 --> 01:05:49,902
Now, you happy
about this? Is this
what you wanted, cop?

909
01:05:49,946 --> 01:05:51,556
It's not what
I wanted, Howard.

910
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:52,949
[Anita]
Look,
forget about it.

911
01:05:52,992 --> 01:05:55,952
It should be him
instead of that cop!

912
01:05:55,995 --> 01:05:57,605
Back off!

913
01:05:57,649 --> 01:05:59,956
And get those hands up
where I can see them!

914
01:05:59,999 --> 01:06:01,740
Let's go, please!

915
01:06:01,783 --> 01:06:03,872
All right.
We'll take
him with us.

916
01:06:03,916 --> 01:06:07,137
I want you
to cover me.

917
01:06:07,180 --> 01:06:09,835
I want you to get
in that car over there.

918
01:06:09,878 --> 01:06:12,881
Okay?
Let's go.
C'mon, Move!

919
01:06:12,925 --> 01:06:14,535
Let's go.

920
01:06:14,579 --> 01:06:16,015
Move!

921
01:06:16,059 --> 01:06:19,497
C'mon!

922
01:06:19,540 --> 01:06:22,979
You get in first.
Get in first.

923
01:06:23,022 --> 01:06:25,068
All right.
Get in.

924
01:06:36,209 --> 01:06:40,866
[Anita]
Open the door.

925
01:06:40,909 --> 01:06:43,216
C'mon.

926
01:06:43,260 --> 01:06:45,697
What the fuck are
we gonna do with
him now, huh?

927
01:06:45,740 --> 01:06:47,220
We should go
easy on him.

928
01:06:47,264 --> 01:06:50,484
Go easy on him?

929
01:06:50,528 --> 01:06:55,968
Shit!

930
01:06:56,012 --> 01:06:59,189
[Howard]
Turn around.
Don't look at me.

931
01:06:59,232 --> 01:07:02,105
You're not gonna do
something stupid,
are you, Howard?

932
01:07:02,148 --> 01:07:04,194
You're the one
that's stupid, mister.

933
01:07:04,237 --> 01:07:06,587
You wanna know why?
'Cause I've got
this gun.

934
01:07:06,631 --> 01:07:09,851
So long as I got
it, I'm smart,
you're stupid.

935
01:07:09,895 --> 01:07:14,073
You got that?

936
01:07:14,117 --> 01:07:20,427
Now, you didn't think
about that happening,
did you, huh?

937
01:07:20,471 --> 01:07:23,256
I oughtta kill you
right now. I just kept
your head right off.

938
01:07:23,300 --> 01:07:27,782
No, please,
don't kill him.
He's Joy's father.

939
01:07:27,826 --> 01:07:29,958
Damn it!

940
01:07:36,139 --> 01:07:39,055
Jesus Christ!
Goddamn it, Anita!

941
01:07:39,098 --> 01:07:41,796
What are we
gonna do with him?

942
01:07:41,840 --> 01:07:43,581
You see that
girl, mister?

943
01:07:43,624 --> 01:07:46,714
The one you called trash?
Well, she just saved
your life.

944
01:07:46,758 --> 01:07:49,717
What do you think
about that, huh?

945
01:07:54,766 --> 01:07:57,334
You remember that.

946
01:08:02,861 --> 01:08:06,299
We can't stay here.
Come on.

947
01:08:14,002 --> 01:08:17,005
Do you think
you hurt him
real bad?

948
01:08:17,049 --> 01:08:21,793
He brought that
on himself didn't he.

949
01:08:21,836 --> 01:08:27,364
He's already
in the dune.

950
01:08:27,407 --> 01:08:31,933
Our lives are
over now.

951
01:08:31,977 --> 01:08:34,371
Yeah, well, I know
when it's over.

952
01:08:34,414 --> 01:08:39,506
[siren wailing]

953
01:08:39,550 --> 01:08:41,943
Not any place
for us to go?

954
01:08:41,987 --> 01:08:44,032
There's no place
for us now.

955
01:08:44,076 --> 01:08:47,035
Nowhere at all.

956
01:08:47,079 --> 01:08:51,257
What about
your mom?

957
01:08:51,301 --> 01:08:52,780
Yeah.

958
01:08:52,824 --> 01:08:53,999
Yeah?

959
01:08:54,042 --> 01:08:55,740
Yeah!

960
01:08:55,783 --> 01:08:58,612
Oh, yes!

961
01:08:58,656 --> 01:09:00,788
She lives up
in Fresno.

962
01:09:00,832 --> 01:09:03,835
Oh, Howard, she's such
a wonderful woman.
She'll help us.

963
01:09:03,878 --> 01:09:06,185
[siren wailing]

964
01:09:06,229 --> 01:09:08,796
I know she'll
help us.

965
01:09:19,285 --> 01:09:22,332
I'm hungry.

966
01:09:22,375 --> 01:09:26,684
Maybe we'll see a
rabbit or something.
We can shoot it.

967
01:09:26,727 --> 01:09:28,903
Fuck that.

968
01:09:28,947 --> 01:09:33,212
Hey, Anita, do you have
to use that language?

969
01:09:33,256 --> 01:09:37,695
I need a cereal
or something.

970
01:09:37,738 --> 01:09:40,306
How much money
we got?

971
01:09:49,924 --> 01:09:54,277
Twenty cents.

972
01:09:54,320 --> 01:10:00,065
Well, that
ain't gonna do.

973
01:10:00,108 --> 01:10:03,242
I really miss
my trailer.

974
01:10:03,286 --> 01:10:05,940
I wouldn't so much.

975
01:10:05,984 --> 01:10:11,337
Yeah, but
it was mine.

976
01:10:11,381 --> 01:10:13,992
I'll tell you what.

977
01:10:14,035 --> 01:10:17,169
I'll buy another
when my ship
comes in.

978
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:19,954
Okay.

979
01:10:19,998 --> 01:10:21,347
Look out!

980
01:10:21,391 --> 01:10:28,093
[shouts]

981
01:10:28,136 --> 01:10:29,921
Are you all right?

982
01:10:29,964 --> 01:10:31,444
Yeah.

983
01:10:31,488 --> 01:10:33,098
A dog?

984
01:10:33,141 --> 01:10:35,274
A dog!

985
01:10:35,318 --> 01:10:37,581
Come here, boy!

986
01:10:37,624 --> 01:10:39,191
Hi!

987
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:40,584
How big.

988
01:10:40,627 --> 01:10:42,107
Huge dog.

989
01:10:42,150 --> 01:10:45,284
Hi, big dog.
Hi, big dog.

990
01:10:45,328 --> 01:10:47,852
His name is
Sh--Shlitzy?

991
01:10:47,895 --> 01:10:50,158
I think he lives--

992
01:10:50,202 --> 01:10:52,465
She lives over there.

993
01:10:52,509 --> 01:10:55,860
Let me take
her over.
C'mon.

994
01:10:55,903 --> 01:10:58,210
Come on.
It's a big dog.

995
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,778
Come on.

996
01:11:09,352 --> 01:11:13,486
[whispers]
There she is.

997
01:11:13,530 --> 01:11:17,098
Hi!
Shlitzy, you
terrible thing.

998
01:11:17,142 --> 01:11:18,926
[Howard]
We found her
on the road.

999
01:11:18,970 --> 01:11:21,929
Thank you so much.

1000
01:11:21,973 --> 01:11:24,976
You going camping?

1001
01:11:25,019 --> 01:11:27,326
Yes, we are.

1002
01:11:27,370 --> 01:11:29,502
Well, thanks.
Thank you very much.

1003
01:11:29,546 --> 01:11:32,766
You're welcome.

1004
01:11:32,810 --> 01:11:38,206
That has been unreal.

1005
01:11:38,250 --> 01:11:39,730
Ciao, ball seven.

1006
01:11:39,773 --> 01:11:44,212
So that's why
I got mirrors
on the tips.

1007
01:11:44,256 --> 01:11:47,346
Deal!

1008
01:11:47,390 --> 01:11:48,913
You want a beer?

1009
01:11:48,956 --> 01:11:50,262
No, thank you.

1010
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:52,264
Okay.

1011
01:12:06,060 --> 01:12:09,237
I want everybody's
hands on that bar
where I can see 'em.

1012
01:12:09,281 --> 01:12:12,153
C'mon, put your
hands up on that bar.

1013
01:12:12,197 --> 01:12:13,938
Nobody's gonna
get hurt.

1014
01:12:13,981 --> 01:12:16,375
You got some balls.
I gotta hand it to you.

1015
01:12:16,419 --> 01:12:18,290
Just trying to get
through the day.

1016
01:12:18,334 --> 01:12:21,032
C'mon, honey,
get their wallets.

1017
01:12:21,075 --> 01:12:24,775
I'm sorry.

1018
01:12:24,818 --> 01:12:26,298
What about
the credit cards?

1019
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:30,171
Just take the cash.
Give the man back
his wallet.

1020
01:12:35,176 --> 01:12:37,178
You're next.

1021
01:12:37,222 --> 01:12:39,833
Take it easy.
Take it easy.

1022
01:12:39,877 --> 01:12:43,054
I'm just gonna
get out my wallet.

1023
01:12:43,097 --> 01:12:44,403
You scared me.

1024
01:12:44,447 --> 01:12:50,888
Yeah.

1025
01:12:50,931 --> 01:12:52,498
That's my whole
paycheck.

1026
01:12:52,542 --> 01:12:55,675
You take it, I'm
not gonna be able
to pay the rent

1027
01:12:55,719 --> 01:12:57,242
or feed my family.

1028
01:12:57,285 --> 01:12:59,113
That's fine
with her.

1029
01:12:59,157 --> 01:13:05,511
She doesn't
have to work.

1030
01:13:05,555 --> 01:13:08,209
I can't take
your money.

1031
01:13:08,253 --> 01:13:11,865
What about me?
I got children, too.

1032
01:13:11,909 --> 01:13:16,566
[man]
I got kids.
Don't rob me.

1033
01:13:16,609 --> 01:13:18,698
I can't do
this, Howard.

1034
01:13:18,742 --> 01:13:20,744
For Christ sake,
don't say my name!

1035
01:13:20,787 --> 01:13:22,223
They know
who we are!

1036
01:13:22,267 --> 01:13:24,225
Here, just
take your money.

1037
01:13:24,269 --> 01:13:26,271
Just let's
leave, please.

1038
01:13:26,314 --> 01:13:30,449
You're the cop
killers, aren't you?

1039
01:13:30,493 --> 01:13:32,320
It is him.

1040
01:13:32,364 --> 01:13:35,411
Okay, all right.
We're going
to the car.

1041
01:13:35,454 --> 01:13:39,066
I want everybody to
put their hands--I want
everybody down in front.

1042
01:13:39,110 --> 01:13:41,895
[telephone rings]

1043
01:13:51,209 --> 01:13:53,820
[Anita]
I'm sorry. I just
couldn't do it.

1044
01:13:53,864 --> 01:13:59,870
Yeah, well, I'm not
gonna turn in today.

1045
01:13:59,913 --> 01:14:06,790
Oh, c'mon.

1046
01:14:06,833 --> 01:14:08,792
I've never done
anything like this.

1047
01:14:08,835 --> 01:14:12,273
You're the one that's
hungry and we ain't
got no money.

1048
01:15:00,017 --> 01:15:02,019
[bell rings]

1049
01:15:10,375 --> 01:15:13,334
[tires screech]

1050
01:15:23,475 --> 01:15:25,608
[Anita]
It's so fresh and
clean around here.

1051
01:15:25,651 --> 01:15:27,131
Yeah, sure it's pretty.

1052
01:15:27,174 --> 01:15:28,872
Yeah, it's very nice.

1053
01:15:28,915 --> 01:15:31,614
You wanna sit here a
while and figure out
what we're gonna do?

1054
01:15:31,657 --> 01:15:36,140
All right.

1055
01:15:36,183 --> 01:15:39,622
Don't worry, Anita.
We'll find your mom.

1056
01:15:39,665 --> 01:15:43,930
Move along.
Get off the steps.

1057
01:15:49,632 --> 01:15:52,460
Excuse me.
Do you know
where ABA--

1058
01:15:52,504 --> 01:15:54,941
Brown.

1059
01:15:54,985 --> 01:15:57,422
Down the corner
to the right.

1060
01:15:57,465 --> 01:15:59,076
Hey, can we get
something to eat?

1061
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:01,644
No, sir. I'm just trying
to get out, okay?

1062
01:16:01,687 --> 01:16:04,255
All right.

1063
01:16:04,298 --> 01:16:06,779
Hey, wait!
Wait!

1064
01:16:06,823 --> 01:16:08,781
[Howard]
Hey, hey!
What are you doing?

1065
01:16:08,825 --> 01:16:12,002
Towing your car, pal.
You got a ticket.
Gonna tow it.

1066
01:16:12,045 --> 01:16:14,178
C'mon, man,
don't tow our car.

1067
01:16:14,221 --> 01:16:15,962
You got 65 bucks?

1068
01:16:16,006 --> 01:16:19,270
I ain't got 65 bucks.
Put it some slack.
Got a really shitty day.

1069
01:16:19,313 --> 01:16:23,535
Yeah? Well, I've had
a shitty day, too.

1070
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:27,365
Look. Let the car off
or I'll blow you away.

1071
01:16:27,408 --> 01:16:29,759
Okay, okay.

1072
01:16:29,802 --> 01:16:32,326
[whispers]
Get in the car.

1073
01:16:32,370 --> 01:16:34,502
Have a nice day.

1074
01:16:49,343 --> 01:16:51,607
[Howard]
You think she'll
let us stay here?

1075
01:16:51,650 --> 01:16:54,261
Sure, she's my mom.

1076
01:17:23,856 --> 01:17:27,512
Hey. Do you know
a Jesse Minteer?

1077
01:17:27,555 --> 01:17:30,297
A lady with long
hair real pretty.

1078
01:17:36,434 --> 01:17:37,957
Which number was it?

1079
01:17:38,001 --> 01:17:42,092
I'm pretty sure
it's four.

1080
01:17:42,135 --> 01:17:43,528
Okay, hold on.

1081
01:17:43,571 --> 01:17:46,836
[baby crying]

1082
01:17:53,146 --> 01:17:58,543
I'm looking
for Jesse Minteer.

1083
01:17:58,586 --> 01:18:01,415
Could you just tell
me where she is?
She's my mother.

1084
01:18:01,459 --> 01:18:06,551
Your mother ran out
on a $1,500-bond.

1085
01:18:06,594 --> 01:18:08,466
Where would
she go?

1086
01:18:08,509 --> 01:18:10,598
Probably ran with
that Rooney clown
for all I know.

1087
01:18:10,642 --> 01:18:13,123
You wanna make
some money?

1088
01:18:13,166 --> 01:18:16,213
Why don't you come
over here and show me
what you can do for me.

1089
01:18:16,256 --> 01:18:17,867
Pay off your
mama's bill.

1090
01:18:17,910 --> 01:18:22,654
Excuse me, hon.

1091
01:18:22,698 --> 01:18:26,571
Where's my mother?
I want my mom!

1092
01:18:26,614 --> 01:18:28,965
Hey, don't you use
that tone with me, girl.

1093
01:18:29,008 --> 01:18:31,010
Look, where is she?

1094
01:18:31,054 --> 01:18:34,622
How the hell would
I know? Your mama
is a whore and a liar.

1095
01:18:34,666 --> 01:18:37,190
She didn't tell
me nothing!

1096
01:18:44,545 --> 01:18:49,986
Lets go.
Bitch.

1097
01:18:50,029 --> 01:18:55,643
Hey, wait up.

1098
01:18:55,687 --> 01:18:59,822
Anita, I'm sorry
about your mom.

1099
01:18:59,865 --> 01:19:03,521
I really don't
wanna talk
about it.

1100
01:19:38,686 --> 01:19:40,036
I'm gonna go
check it out.

1101
01:19:40,079 --> 01:19:46,607
Okay.

1102
01:19:46,651 --> 01:19:52,048
A little pesky.

1103
01:19:52,091 --> 01:19:54,354
Go on.
Get out.

1104
01:20:04,669 --> 01:20:07,803
Nobody. There's
room in hand.

1105
01:20:13,156 --> 01:20:14,461
Hey.

1106
01:20:14,505 --> 01:20:18,552
Hi! Come
here, baby.

1107
01:20:18,596 --> 01:20:22,078
Hi!
Oh, sweetie.

1108
01:20:22,121 --> 01:20:24,602
Hi!

1109
01:20:24,645 --> 01:20:28,998
It seems strange that
they just leave their
dog here like this.

1110
01:20:32,697 --> 01:20:34,307
Anything good?

1111
01:20:40,183 --> 01:20:45,579
I'm sorry.

1112
01:20:45,623 --> 01:20:49,714
You know what?
You are so beautiful.

1113
01:20:49,757 --> 01:20:53,239
You remind me
all those people
that we saw in Fresno.

1114
01:20:53,283 --> 01:20:56,939
All fresh and clean.

1115
01:20:56,982 --> 01:20:58,636
I don't know.

1116
01:20:58,679 --> 01:21:01,334
You do, too,
Howard.

1117
01:21:01,378 --> 01:21:03,771
We look like
nice people.

1118
01:21:03,815 --> 01:21:05,773
We are nice people.

1119
01:21:05,817 --> 01:21:08,385
[dog cries]

1120
01:21:08,428 --> 01:21:10,561
Come here, baby.

1121
01:21:10,604 --> 01:21:13,433
Come here.

1122
01:21:13,477 --> 01:21:17,002
And I swear,
you'd make a great mother.

1123
01:21:23,182 --> 01:21:27,360
Go on, get out of the way,
I wanna kiss you.

1124
01:21:33,279 --> 01:21:37,109
[both laugh]

1125
01:21:37,153 --> 01:21:39,807
That looks like
so much fun!

1126
01:21:39,851 --> 01:21:42,375
Yeah, it does.

1127
01:21:42,419 --> 01:21:47,032
I guess we didn't
really have a proper
honeymoon, did we?

1128
01:21:47,076 --> 01:21:48,816
No, we didn't.

1129
01:21:48,860 --> 01:21:51,994
Yeah. Maybe Niagara Falls.
That's pretty romantic.

1130
01:21:52,037 --> 01:21:55,867
Mmm. Let's go
to Niagara Falls.

1131
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:57,477
All right.

1132
01:21:57,521 --> 01:22:00,524
We can go
to a lot of places.

1133
01:22:00,567 --> 01:22:03,396
Promise?

1134
01:22:03,440 --> 01:22:07,052
Cross my heart
and hope to die.

1135
01:22:10,403 --> 01:22:12,231
Okay, that sounds good.

1136
01:22:12,275 --> 01:22:14,059
Oh, wait, that's
my other line.

1137
01:22:14,103 --> 01:22:16,801
All right.
Me, too.

1138
01:22:16,844 --> 01:22:18,977
Bye.

1139
01:22:19,021 --> 01:22:20,631
Hello!

1140
01:22:20,674 --> 01:22:23,721
Anita!

1141
01:22:23,764 --> 01:22:27,725
Where are you?

1142
01:22:27,768 --> 01:22:31,729
Is he there
with you right now?

1143
01:22:31,772 --> 01:22:34,732
Yeah, he is.

1144
01:22:34,775 --> 01:22:38,475
I just wanted
to call and talk.

1145
01:22:38,518 --> 01:22:43,828
Did he really do
all those things
they're saying?

1146
01:22:43,871 --> 01:22:46,744
He ain't so bad.

1147
01:22:46,787 --> 01:22:48,746
They say that
you're in it
with him.

1148
01:22:48,789 --> 01:22:51,357
Anita!
We're on TV!

1149
01:22:51,401 --> 01:22:52,837
Oh, my God!

1150
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:54,665
Me and Howard
are on TV.
I gotta go.

1151
01:22:54,708 --> 01:22:56,493
Anita, wait!

1152
01:22:56,536 --> 01:22:59,626
Joy, listen. I just
wanted to thank you
for your friendship.

1153
01:22:59,670 --> 01:23:01,324
I gotta go.
I'll call you.

1154
01:23:01,367 --> 01:23:03,500
[woman reporter]
Live from
Reno, Nevada.

1155
01:23:03,543 --> 01:23:07,504
I'm here with Ray Hickok,
father of murder
suspect Howard Hickok.

1156
01:23:07,547 --> 01:23:09,941
Oh, my god.
That's my father.

1157
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:13,466
My son?

1158
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:16,904
They can strap him
in the electric chair
and I'd pull the switch.

1159
01:23:16,948 --> 01:23:18,819
I'd be happy
doing it, too.

1160
01:23:18,863 --> 01:23:21,126
The Police believe
the male suspect,
Howard Hickok

1161
01:23:21,170 --> 01:23:25,696
may be responsible for as
many as four homicides
in the last 72 hours,

1162
01:23:25,739 --> 01:23:28,307
including the murder
of a police officer.

1163
01:23:28,351 --> 01:23:32,485
There are some questions
as whether the 16-year-old
girl traveling with him

1164
01:23:32,529 --> 01:23:36,141
is a hostage
or an accomplice.

1165
01:23:38,665 --> 01:23:42,582
Oh, c'mon.
Cheer up.

1166
01:23:42,626 --> 01:23:44,323
We're celebrities.

1167
01:23:44,367 --> 01:23:46,978
We're gonna have people
asking for autographs.

1168
01:23:47,022 --> 01:23:53,289
Yeah, well, our autographs
won't be worth a spit
once we're dead.

1169
01:23:53,332 --> 01:23:56,727
Yeah, well.

1170
01:23:56,770 --> 01:23:58,772
Maybe we could go
to like, um,

1171
01:23:58,816 --> 01:24:05,953
one of those South
American countries,
like Colombia or, um,

1172
01:24:05,997 --> 01:24:08,956
Mexico or Afghanistan
or some place like that.

1173
01:24:09,000 --> 01:24:14,310
Right? I hear
Americans can live
really well down there.

1174
01:24:33,894 --> 01:24:37,159
[moaning]

1175
01:24:39,378 --> 01:24:43,339
It's like,
It's like...

1176
01:24:43,382 --> 01:24:45,732
[whispers]
Your part of my body.

1177
01:24:45,776 --> 01:24:50,868
I am, Howard.
I am.

1178
01:25:14,544 --> 01:25:16,415
What?

1179
01:25:16,459 --> 01:25:19,375
I'm just sad,
that's all.

1180
01:25:19,418 --> 01:25:21,681
What's wrong?

1181
01:25:21,725 --> 01:25:23,901
Because they're
gonna catch us.

1182
01:25:23,944 --> 01:25:26,730
Well, not if we
play our cards right.

1183
01:25:26,773 --> 01:25:28,558
They're gonna
find us,

1184
01:25:28,601 --> 01:25:30,908
and they're
gonna shoot us.

1185
01:25:30,951 --> 01:25:35,695
And if they don't,
then the State will
later, Howard.

1186
01:25:35,739 --> 01:25:39,830
I guess that's pretty
predictable, huh?

1187
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:47,011
I never really
minded dying before.

1188
01:25:47,054 --> 01:25:49,883
But what I didn't
realize is that I
was never really alive

1189
01:25:49,927 --> 01:25:53,235
until I hooked
up with you.

1190
01:25:55,889 --> 01:26:00,851
Oh, baby, I wish
you'd never got
mixed up with me.

1191
01:26:04,071 --> 01:26:06,117
[dog barks
at a distance]

1192
01:26:23,787 --> 01:26:25,963
What is it?

1193
01:26:26,006 --> 01:26:30,097
Nothing.

1194
01:26:30,141 --> 01:26:33,057
Go on, crazy dog!

1195
01:26:51,945 --> 01:26:54,470
Dad?

1196
01:26:54,513 --> 01:26:57,516
Go back
to sleep, hon.

1197
01:26:57,560 --> 01:27:02,129
What--what's
going on?

1198
01:27:02,173 --> 01:27:03,914
We found your
little friend Anita.

1199
01:27:03,957 --> 01:27:06,960
She's holed up in
a house with that
boyfriend of hers.

1200
01:27:07,004 --> 01:27:08,179
I'm going there now.

1201
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:11,095
Dad!

1202
01:27:11,138 --> 01:27:15,360
Don't forget she
saved your life.

1203
01:27:17,406 --> 01:27:20,496
Go back to sleep.

1204
01:27:44,215 --> 01:27:47,349
Shit.

1205
01:27:47,392 --> 01:27:49,264
What's going on?

1206
01:28:00,492 --> 01:28:03,974
They're out back too.

1207
01:28:04,017 --> 01:28:09,545
Well, if I'm gonna
die, I wanna have
my clothes on.

1208
01:28:09,588 --> 01:28:12,635
This is the Police.
Come out with
your hands up.

1209
01:28:12,678 --> 01:28:15,072
This will be
your only chance.

1210
01:28:24,690 --> 01:28:25,865
Oh, shit.

1211
01:28:25,909 --> 01:28:27,345
This is it, Howard.

1212
01:28:27,389 --> 01:28:30,217
All right, baby.
Now, I'm not gonna
get a chance.

1213
01:28:30,261 --> 01:28:35,875
I wanna make sure
that you're gonna
get one, all right?

1214
01:28:35,919 --> 01:28:37,094
[coughs]

1215
01:28:37,137 --> 01:28:40,445
Hey you,
out there!
Listen!

1216
01:28:40,489 --> 01:28:44,057
You come in here
and I swear I'll
shoot this girl!

1217
01:29:21,530 --> 01:29:24,010
You don't need this no more.

1218
01:29:29,189 --> 01:29:31,366
I mean it Pigs,
I'll kill her.

1219
01:29:31,409 --> 01:29:35,892
She'll be dead and
it'll be on your head.

1220
01:29:35,935 --> 01:29:39,504
All right.
You know what
to say, don't you?

1221
01:29:39,548 --> 01:29:41,158
I don't mind
dying, Howard.

1222
01:29:41,201 --> 01:29:43,160
Oh, c'mon, you
know what to say.

1223
01:29:43,203 --> 01:29:47,251
When you get
down to that station.

1224
01:29:47,294 --> 01:29:48,992
Don't let 'em
get to you.

1225
01:29:49,035 --> 01:29:51,908
They're gonna try
and play all kind
of mind games on you.

1226
01:29:51,951 --> 01:29:55,085
Just gotta remember
that all they're gonna
try and do is ruin you.

1227
01:29:55,128 --> 01:29:57,348
You understand?

1228
01:29:57,392 --> 01:29:59,481
Huh?

1229
01:29:59,524 --> 01:30:03,398
All right.

1230
01:30:08,141 --> 01:30:09,969
Oh, baby.

1231
01:30:10,013 --> 01:30:14,104
I feel so much
better now.

1232
01:30:14,147 --> 01:30:17,063
You know that
I love you, Anita.

1233
01:30:17,107 --> 01:30:20,415
I never said those
words to anybody
in my whole life.

1234
01:30:20,458 --> 01:30:25,463
I love you and I'll
be waiting for you
on the other side.

1235
01:30:25,507 --> 01:30:29,336
I just know God
is gonna like me.

1236
01:30:29,380 --> 01:30:32,557
You know how
I know that?

1237
01:30:32,601 --> 01:30:36,343
Because you
like me.

1238
01:30:36,387 --> 01:30:41,653
[sobs]

1239
01:30:41,697 --> 01:30:46,484
He's gonna
love you, Howard.

1240
01:30:46,528 --> 01:30:49,269
All right, now,
no more tears.

1241
01:30:49,313 --> 01:30:53,926
Save that for
when you get down
to the station.

1242
01:30:53,970 --> 01:31:00,498
Maybe what we did
tonight, maybe we
made ourselves a baby.

1243
01:31:00,542 --> 01:31:03,675
[sobs]
No!

1244
01:31:09,507 --> 01:31:11,335
All right
I'll kill her!

1245
01:31:11,378 --> 01:31:13,555
I swear I've got
nothing to lose!

1246
01:31:28,047 --> 01:31:30,136
[screams]

1247
01:32:26,279 --> 01:32:28,238
He made me do it.
