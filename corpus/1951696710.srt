1
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:51,360
"Who are you?"

2
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,920
It's a simple one, right?

3
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,880
No. No, not really.

4
00:00:56,920 --> 00:01:00,120
Because if it was,
you wouldn't be here.

5
00:01:00,200 --> 00:01:06,120
You people are going
to find out who you are.

6
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:10,800
So, you are going to write
a daily Journal.

7
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:11,800
And guess what?

8
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:13,360
You'll start the first thing
tomorrow morning.

9
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:14,560
You're gonna get up,
sit down,

10
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:17,040
and you are going to tell
the Journal your name,

11
00:01:17,120 --> 00:01:20,760
a bit about yourself,
your life and your world.

12
00:01:22,040 --> 00:01:23,760
"Who...

13
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,240
"am...

14
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:29,440
...I?"

15
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,720
I shall see you all again
next week.

16
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,280
Journal entry, day one.

17
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,520
My name is Jack Giamoro.

18
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:08,560
I live in Malibu, California,
with my wife Nina.

19
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,560
Nina is...

20
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,960
Nina is...

21
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:17,840
a good swimmer.

22
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:19,600
She likes to swim.

23
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:21,200
We've been married four years,

24
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:26,040
and she's a very...

25
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:27,800
strong swimmer.

26
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,080
My father, Ben Giamoro,
lives with us now.

27
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:34,520
Dad was a movie producer in the '60s,

28
00:02:34,600 --> 00:02:36,760
mostly low-budget
teen car chase movies,

29
00:02:36,800 --> 00:02:38,640
science fiction stuff.

30
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:39,800
It wasn't what he wanted to do,

31
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:41,720
but he was strong and bullheaded

32
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,160
and people loved him.

33
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:48,480
Six months,
two weeks ago today,

34
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:51,160
Dad had a stroke
that almost killed him.

35
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:54,360
Dad's...

36
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:59,160
Dad is getting better.

37
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:01,800
I am a talent agent.

38
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,000
I help talented people navigate their dreams
through a treacherous world.

39
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,600
I specialize in handling
television writers,

40
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:14,640
people that would be much better suited
to this assignment than I am.

41
00:03:18,120 --> 00:03:21,000
Some mornings I get to work
and it's easy.

42
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:24,080
I'm good and calm, relaxed,

43
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:26,640
ready to face whatever
the day throws at me.

44
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:34,360
Some mornings I get stuck in traffic, though.

45
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:35,480
I get stuck in traffic,

46
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:37,760
and I sit there and think about my life,

47
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,520
about the world,

48
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:42,440
about what's out there
waiting to take me,

49
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,000
to test me, to destroy me.

50
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,240
On these days,
I get to work Just a tad less friendly.

51
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:54,600
End of Journal entry.

52
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:02,160
Good morning.

53
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:09,360
Partner meeting in ten minutes.

54
00:04:09,440 --> 00:04:10,400
I got it.

55
00:04:10,440 --> 00:04:12,200
Hey, Jack, you need anything?
Coffee, bagel?

56
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:13,320
No, I'm fine, thank you.

57
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:14,640
Hey, you see the game yesterday?

58
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:15,720
It was a good shot.

59
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:17,280
Last minute.

60
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:19,080
Lucky, get out.

61
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,520
I think my wife
has been having an affair.

62
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:36,200
I don't know who it is,

63
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,040
but I think my wife may be
having an affair.

64
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:51,720
Partner meeting.

65
00:04:51,760 --> 00:04:54,080
Yeah, I'm coming.

66
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:56,960
Be right there.

67
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:00,360
All right.
We gonna start?

68
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:01,440
We're waiting for you, Jack.

69
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,840
Are you gonna sit down?

70
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,640
I've got an 11:30 at NBC.
I don't wanna crease this shirt.

71
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:05,840
Start.

72
00:05:05,920 --> 00:05:07,920
You're a tragic figure.
I swear to God.

73
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:09,320
Do you have that David Lilly lunch today?

74
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,120
Yeah, I do, but it's not a lock,
so we'll see.

75
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:13,800
You'll sign him.
I have faith.

76
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,400
I IMDB'd him last night.

77
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:18,040
The guy's created seven hit series
and he's still only 35.

78
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:20,080
He's way too hot for us
not to own him.

79
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:22,120
He's a bucket of money, Jack.
We need him. Make it happen.

80
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,280
I'm aware of that,
thank you very much, guys,

81
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:24,840
I appreciate it.

82
00:05:24,920 --> 00:05:26,960
I'm Just saying he took the meeting with me
as a favor to me.

83
00:05:27,040 --> 00:05:29,360
So, while I guarantee you
I will sign him,

84
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:32,120
it may not be today
that I sign him, okay?

85
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:33,480
- Calm down.
- So, Jack...

86
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,960
what's this adult ed class
you took last night?

87
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:40,160
Where did you hear about that?

88
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:42,280
What class are you taking?
Journal writing?

89
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:43,560
What is that for?

90
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,480
It's a self-exploration technique.

91
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:48,240
It's meant to make me
a better team player here.

92
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:50,280
I'll probably be recommending
everybody take the class.

93
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:51,120
Oh, come on.

94
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:52,400
You got us in karate,

95
00:05:52,480 --> 00:05:55,160
Kabbalah meetings,
environmental coffees.

96
00:05:55,240 --> 00:05:56,840
Any chance you're gonna
shit-can this thing

97
00:05:56,880 --> 00:05:58,800
so I can sit home one night
and lay around on the couch?

98
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:01,080
I don't shit-can things.
I finish what I start.

99
00:06:01,160 --> 00:06:03,240
Why don't you Just go to therapy
like normal fucked up people do?

100
00:06:03,320 --> 00:06:05,120
Why don't we start the meeting?

101
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:06,520
How about that?

102
00:06:06,600 --> 00:06:09,040
Hey! Put the phone down.

103
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:10,360
Who'd you tell I was
taking that class?

104
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:11,400
Did you tell Arlene's assistant?

105
00:06:11,480 --> 00:06:12,840
- The truth?
- Yes, the truth.

106
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:13,800
I think I did.

107
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,560
Lucky, you...
Why would you do that?

108
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:16,560
That's my private business.

109
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:19,080
I don't like my personal business
being out in the street, okay?

110
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:20,720
As a blanket rule,
do not tell anybody

111
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:23,640
anything about my life ever, okay?

112
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:24,800
Who else did you tell?

113
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:27,320
- The truth?
- Yes, Lucky, the truth!

114
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,360
David Lilly's assistant.

115
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,600
Oh, my God!

116
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:32,080
They wanted to switch lunch
to drinks last night.

117
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,040
I don't know how
you graduated from Harvard.

118
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:35,720
You have the common sense
of a five-year-old.

119
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:37,960
If I didn't have so much to do
today, I'd fire you.

120
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:41,480
Mom, I gotta go.

121
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:56,040
So, Jack,

122
00:06:56,120 --> 00:06:59,720
what is up with you and this
Journal-writing course?

123
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:03,160
Come on, man.
What is that?

124
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,520
That's... that's funny that you ask.

125
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:07,840
That's...

126
00:07:07,920 --> 00:07:09,040
Just something
I'm doing on the side

127
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:11,560
to try to understand
the writing process better.

128
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:14,600
Look, man, you know,
what it comes down to is...

129
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,040
I love writers.

130
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,320
That's my life.

131
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:19,480
I always wanted to be a writer,
but I'm not.

132
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:22,440
I'm not good enough and... you are.

133
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,160
L... Look, I gotta ask you something.

134
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:29,200
And think about this
before you answer.

135
00:07:30,520 --> 00:07:33,800
David, are you happy?

136
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:36,720
Well, I'm not doing
anything as drastic

137
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,960
as writing a morning diary.

138
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:42,000
But, yeah.
I stay happy.

139
00:07:42,040 --> 00:07:43,440
You don't have to dress
up in women's clothes

140
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,760
to write in that thing, do you?

141
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:50,120
That's funny.

142
00:08:11,200 --> 00:08:12,800
- Hey.
- Hey.

143
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:15,720
- How was your day?
- Brutal.

144
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:17,160
How was
the scleroderma dinner?

145
00:08:17,240 --> 00:08:19,000
It was good.

146
00:08:22,680 --> 00:08:24,160
Bob Saget was funny.

147
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,720
Where'd you go after that?
I called you a couple times.

148
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,640
You did?

149
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,080
Yeah.

150
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:31,080
That's weird.

151
00:08:31,160 --> 00:08:33,160
My cell phone was on all night.

152
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:35,360
Coverage in this city
is so in and out.

153
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:37,720
What's up with that?

154
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:41,840
Should I read this?
Should I?

155
00:08:41,920 --> 00:08:44,120
No! I don't need
to read this yet.

156
00:08:44,160 --> 00:08:45,640
I don't need to read
any of your Journals.

157
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:46,720
You know why?

158
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:48,760
Because there's nothing in them.

159
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,680
They're empty, boring,
surface fluff.

160
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:57,680
First week always is.
Nothing.

161
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:03,080
Short staccato sentences
masquerading as disclosure.

162
00:09:03,160 --> 00:09:06,520
It's what you know about
yourself without my help.

163
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:10,560
Your postman knows
more about you than this.

164
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,880
I want more.

165
00:09:12,960 --> 00:09:17,640
This week, I want secrets.

166
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:19,560
Things other people don't know.

167
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:23,840
Things you don't know... yet.

168
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:25,680
Because, you see,

169
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,480
the clues to who you are
are buried in those secrets.

170
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:36,480
It's like hidden gold under
a twenty-foot pile of horseshit.

171
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,760
Nobody wants to dig through it.
But guess what?

172
00:09:38,840 --> 00:09:40,360
It's in there. The truth.

173
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:43,600
Waiting patiently under
all the horseshit

174
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:49,400
that is the build-up
of our silly little lives.

175
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:54,120
So...

176
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:56,200
go in and get it, people.

177
00:09:56,280 --> 00:09:58,520
Dig for the truth.

178
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:01,760
And people, please.

179
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:03,320
Spelling. It's important.

180
00:10:03,400 --> 00:10:04,600
Get it right.

181
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:08,520
So...

182
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,760
I'll see you next week.

183
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:23,840
Hey, Dad.

184
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:25,880
Hey.

185
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:29,320
You're up.

186
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:35,160
This was your mother's favorite show.

187
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,200
I waited too long to marry.

188
00:10:56,280 --> 00:10:58,200
I should have done it in my twenties.

189
00:11:02,280 --> 00:11:04,680
I'm too set in my ways.

190
00:11:04,760 --> 00:11:07,320
I've treated Nina
like a possession,

191
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,880
one of the things I've struggled for,
like my company,

192
00:11:09,960 --> 00:11:12,920
my clients, my abdomen.

193
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:16,600
I work harder on my abdomen
than I do on my marriage.

194
00:11:17,520 --> 00:11:18,280
You know why?

195
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:20,840
Because this will be
the David Lilly Agency, that's why.

196
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:22,800
Because every
single person we have here

197
00:11:22,840 --> 00:11:25,480
would be devoted
to advancing your career.

198
00:11:25,520 --> 00:11:26,760
Come on, David.
I talked to you last week.

199
00:11:26,840 --> 00:11:27,880
You said you'd think about it.

200
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:29,440
You're unrepresented right now.

201
00:11:29,520 --> 00:11:31,880
Yeah, Jack,
I thought it through,

202
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:34,080
and I'm gonna pass
and say thank you.

203
00:11:34,680 --> 00:11:36,680
All right.
I understand that.

204
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:38,760
That's perfectly reasonable.

205
00:11:38,840 --> 00:11:39,920
But will you
at least do me the honor

206
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,840
of passing to me in person

207
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:43,840
on the floor of
the Lakers game tonight?

208
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:46,960
Hold on a second, okay?
Hey, Brynn.

209
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,400
- Brynn.
- What?

210
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:50,040
You have play rehearsal tonight?

211
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:53,160
- Why? Who is that?
- It's Jack Giamoro.

212
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,600
He wants to know if I want
to go to the Lakers tonight.

213
00:11:54,640 --> 00:11:56,440
Come on.
The hell he does.

214
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,120
He knows you left your agent.

215
00:11:58,160 --> 00:11:58,960
He Just wants to sign you.

216
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,000
What's going on?

217
00:12:01,080 --> 00:12:02,480
Tell him you have to
take care of the kids.

218
00:12:04,280 --> 00:12:06,880
Listen, Jack, I'm sorry.
I cannot do it tonight.

219
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,800
Brynn is in this play,
and tonight she's got rehearsal,

220
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:10,280
so I'm stuck with the kids.

221
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:12,200
The kids.

222
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:14,160
- Game over.
- I understand that.

223
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:15,560
It's more important than any of this.
Good for you.

224
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:17,880
Listen, buddy, I would benefit
from spending some time with you.

225
00:12:17,960 --> 00:12:19,520
What's he saying?

226
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:22,160
So, Just selfishly,
will you have lunch with me this week?

227
00:12:22,240 --> 00:12:23,880
Okay, Jack.
Sounds great.

228
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:25,960
Thank you. Okay.

229
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:27,200
All right, I'll talk to you soon.

230
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,400
Take care of yourself.
All right.

231
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:33,120
Piece of shit.

232
00:12:33,200 --> 00:12:35,920
Well, he trumped you with
that stuff with the kids.

233
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:37,960
By the way, the Laker game?
Jack, come on.

234
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:39,160
You sound like a fool saying that.

235
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:42,240
Every agency has got
Laker floor seats now, so...

236
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:45,960
Anyway, you've got a bigger problem
than not signing David Lilly.

237
00:12:46,040 --> 00:12:47,280
Phil Balow.

238
00:12:47,320 --> 00:12:48,840
The puppy here was asleep at the wheel.

239
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:51,280
Whoa, the puppy was not
asleep behind no wheel.

240
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,600
- What happened?
- You put four calls in to the guy.

241
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,280
He hasn't returned one
in three weeks.

242
00:12:55,320 --> 00:12:57,200
Phil Balow's not calling me back?

243
00:12:57,240 --> 00:12:58,480
Jeez, I must have been so crazy,

244
00:12:58,520 --> 00:12:59,560
I didn't even notice.

245
00:12:59,640 --> 00:13:00,720
Didn't we send him something?

246
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,400
That was last month
when he moved downtown.

247
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:03,760
Phil moved downtown?

248
00:13:03,800 --> 00:13:05,880
Yeah. Him and Sela
got a loft downtown.

249
00:13:05,960 --> 00:13:08,360
I guess they think the Westside
is too white or something.

250
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:09,680
Downtown?

251
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:10,480
Yeah, I don't get it either.

252
00:13:10,520 --> 00:13:11,480
You know what?

253
00:13:11,560 --> 00:13:15,480
I don't really get any of this, but, Jack,
fantastic Job signing David Lilly.

254
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:17,400
It's amazing watching
the master work.

255
00:13:17,480 --> 00:13:18,440
Thanks, Fineberg.

256
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:20,480
You're the best partner
a guy could ask for.

257
00:13:20,560 --> 00:13:22,680
Sounds to me like you're
about to lose Phil, Jack.

258
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:23,960
Goddamn it.

259
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,840
Phil Balow was the creator
of the situation comedy,

260
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:38,160
<i>The DiPsy Doodle Show.</i>

261
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:39,920
I can't afford a problem with Phil.

262
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:41,000
It's all a math equation.

263
00:13:41,080 --> 00:13:44,520
I'm me because at any given time,
I have three Phil Balows.

264
00:13:44,600 --> 00:13:46,000
Hey.

265
00:13:46,080 --> 00:13:48,240
Jack! Jesus!
Sorry.

266
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:49,720
Did I catch you
at a bad time?

267
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:51,360
No. Well, yeah.
I mean...

268
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:55,760
No, you know, we're Just in the middle of,
you know, rehearsal.

269
00:13:55,840 --> 00:13:56,800
Sure, sure.

270
00:13:56,880 --> 00:13:57,800
What's up?
What's up?

271
00:13:57,880 --> 00:13:59,480
You haven't returned
my calls in three weeks.

272
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,520
It's not like you, Phil.

273
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:01,680
I Just want to make sure
everything's okay.

274
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:04,400
Yeah, no, yeah.
Oh, no, yeah, no.

275
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:05,520
I'm good. No, I'm fine.

276
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:08,560
- You happy?
- No, yeah.

277
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:10,320
Yes, yes, no.

278
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:12,880
- Yeah. Yeah, no.
- Okay. All right.

279
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:13,920
It's all good, right?

280
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:15,240
I mean, that's the thing, right?

281
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:17,760
But... right.

282
00:14:17,840 --> 00:14:20,120
But you know what?
I gotta do this, 'cause, you know...

283
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:21,440
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Right, right.

284
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:22,880
- So... Okay.
- All right. Great.

285
00:14:22,960 --> 00:14:23,920
- Okay, man.
- Good to see you.

286
00:14:23,960 --> 00:14:25,400
- Okay, okay, okay.
- All right.

287
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:26,240
I'll talk to you soon.

288
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:27,360
Okay. Okay.

289
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:29,920
- Looks good.
- Okay. Okay.

290
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,240
So, we can't say "vulva,"
but we can say "fallopian."

291
00:14:36,320 --> 00:14:38,920
I don't understand.
I think "vulva" is fine.

292
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:40,080
Now, is it the product?

293
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:42,560
Is it because of Volvo
that we can't say that...

294
00:14:55,800 --> 00:15:00,960
You have one new message.
Sent today at 6:01 p.m.

295
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,920
Hey, Jack, it's Phil.
Look, I gotta talk to you.

296
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,800
It was tough today
when you came by.

297
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,200
Something's going on.
You know?

298
00:15:08,280 --> 00:15:09,840
And it's Just not like me.

299
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:11,800
We've got to sit down.

300
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:14,800
You know, we been through
a lot together, you and I,

301
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:16,320
and let's talk in the morning.

302
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:18,080
Okay, we should talk.

303
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,960
He's leaving the agency.
I knew it.

304
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,120
What a life.

305
00:15:48,960 --> 00:15:50,720
Jack! Jack!

306
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,920
L... I love these fish.

307
00:16:08,960 --> 00:16:13,040
They... they make me happy.

308
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:15,040
Sorry.

309
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,120
How about some trousers?

310
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,200
Okay.

311
00:16:25,280 --> 00:16:26,760
Yes.

312
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,840
Jack.

313
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:53,440
Yes?

314
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:01,040
I've been sleeping with Phil.

315
00:17:04,680 --> 00:17:06,240
It Just happened.

316
00:17:07,880 --> 00:17:09,560
He was obsessed with me.

317
00:17:09,640 --> 00:17:12,920
And we'd get together and...

318
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:15,840
I lost control
and it happened.

319
00:17:15,920 --> 00:17:19,040
But it's over, Jack.
I swear it's over.

320
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:22,520
I'm so sorry.

321
00:17:24,840 --> 00:17:27,000
So that's what he's
gonna tell me tomorrow?

322
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:31,280
Because I told him that
I was gonna tell you.

323
00:17:31,880 --> 00:17:33,800
I made such a huge mistake,
Jack.

324
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:35,520
I'm so sorry.

325
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:39,240
I love you so much, Jack.

326
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:41,080
I love you so much.

327
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,080
Nina came along at
a point in my life

328
00:18:00,160 --> 00:18:01,680
where all I did was work...

329
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:04,680
work and plan
and strive and deliver.

330
00:18:04,760 --> 00:18:06,360
I became bigger than life.

331
00:18:06,440 --> 00:18:08,520
I became rich and famous.

332
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:10,040
But I never smiled.

333
00:18:10,120 --> 00:18:13,920
For five years, I never
cracked one genuine smile.

334
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:17,080
Steven Bochco is on line two.
It's important.

335
00:18:17,160 --> 00:18:18,720
Tell Bochco you'll call him back, Jack.

336
00:18:18,800 --> 00:18:21,240
I'm going to a photo shoot
and you're going with me.

337
00:18:21,320 --> 00:18:22,600
I can't. I swamped.

338
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:24,440
Get unswamped.
These are supermodels.

339
00:18:26,280 --> 00:18:27,560
Tell Bochco I'll call him back.

340
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:29,640
That's what I thought you'd say.

341
00:19:04,680 --> 00:19:06,280
Nina brought the light back.

342
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:08,920
It was dark,
and then it was light,

343
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,760
and the only difference was Nina.

344
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:16,600
- Look. You like it?
- Wow. Yeah.

345
00:19:16,680 --> 00:19:20,000
I can paint or sew or whatever.

346
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,200
It's a room for me.

347
00:19:23,160 --> 00:19:24,080
Do you like it?

348
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:25,160
Yeah, it's great.

349
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:26,360
You have built-ins and everything.

350
00:19:26,440 --> 00:19:28,040
- I know.
- What did this cost?

351
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:29,560
That's not important.

352
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:31,320
- That's not important?
- So not important.

353
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:32,520
- It's important to me.
- No. It's not.

354
00:19:32,560 --> 00:19:33,880
I think it's important.

355
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:35,400
I'll figure out some way
to make it up to you.

356
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:37,960
You will?
We can figure it out right now!

357
00:19:39,080 --> 00:19:40,320
Nina's on line one.

358
00:19:41,640 --> 00:19:42,720
Tell her I'm not here.

359
00:19:45,800 --> 00:19:48,760
Guys, we need to talk
about this thing at CBS.

360
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:50,520
We need to prepare for these meetings.

361
00:19:50,600 --> 00:19:51,440
We aren't prepared.

362
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:54,520
You guys spend the entire meeting
talking about your little girlfriends.

363
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,920
That's only because
you won't spend any time

364
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:57,600
talking about your little
girlfriends, Arlene.

365
00:19:57,680 --> 00:19:59,320
If I got one-third of
the snatch you get, Arlene,

366
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,200
I'd be the happiest man
on the planet.

367
00:20:01,240 --> 00:20:02,200
You'd be the
second happiest man.

368
00:20:02,280 --> 00:20:05,960
I'd be the first, 'cause you'd be
telling me all about it, okay?

369
00:20:07,080 --> 00:20:09,480
We have a Phil Balow problem.

370
00:20:12,040 --> 00:20:13,440
Excuse me?

371
00:20:16,360 --> 00:20:18,600
He's been sleeping with my wife.

372
00:20:22,920 --> 00:20:25,120
Okay, all right,
I thought you were being serious.

373
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:26,120
If that's the problem,

374
00:20:26,200 --> 00:20:28,440
who hasn't been sleeping
with your wife?

375
00:20:28,520 --> 00:20:29,720
So have I.

376
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:31,160
Me, too.

377
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:34,640
She confessed to me yesterday,
out of the blue.

378
00:20:34,680 --> 00:20:36,880
Apparently, it's been
going on for some time.

379
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:40,400
Now, I'm telling you
all this as my partners,

380
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,680
as my best friends,
as my family, so I assume

381
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:44,920
I don't have to give
the confidentiality speech right now.

382
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,160
Oh, my God, Jack.

383
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:49,560
If this is true, I'm so sorry.

384
00:20:49,640 --> 00:20:51,000
I don't know what to say.

385
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,120
Jack, this is true?

386
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,160
Yeah.

387
00:20:53,240 --> 00:20:54,320
Apparently, she broke it off with him,

388
00:20:54,360 --> 00:20:56,160
but it may have been
going on for some time.

389
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:57,240
Jesus Christ, Jack.

390
00:20:57,320 --> 00:20:59,960
Is there anything we
can do to help out?

391
00:21:00,040 --> 00:21:02,680
Well, you can support my decision
to drop Phil as a client.

392
00:21:05,480 --> 00:21:07,720
You're kidding, right?

393
00:21:07,800 --> 00:21:09,160
You don't want to drop Phil.

394
00:21:09,240 --> 00:21:11,000
He's about to re-up his deal.

395
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,600
He's starting a new show.

396
00:21:12,680 --> 00:21:14,520
You Just told me the other day
how valuable Phil is.

397
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:17,400
<i>If it does half of
what DiPsy Doodle does,</i>

398
00:21:17,480 --> 00:21:18,360
we're looking at a package

399
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:19,920
that could be in the tens
of millions of dollars.

400
00:21:20,000 --> 00:21:22,040
Jack, you need to
take a deep breath.

401
00:21:22,120 --> 00:21:24,400
Okay? You need to get
straight with Nina, yes.

402
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:27,160
But don't do this, please.

403
00:21:27,240 --> 00:21:28,600
I can take him on day-to-day.

404
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:30,080
You don't even have to
talk to the guy.

405
00:21:31,400 --> 00:21:34,360
He is fucking my wife!

406
00:21:34,440 --> 00:21:36,920
What is it you guys
don't understand about this?

407
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:39,000
His name is off the client list!

408
00:21:39,080 --> 00:21:41,400
Jack, come on.

409
00:21:41,480 --> 00:21:42,840
You're taking this really personal.

410
00:21:49,800 --> 00:21:52,440
That's the closet, Jack.

411
00:21:52,520 --> 00:21:54,080
Who designed this room?

412
00:21:54,160 --> 00:21:56,880
The closet door looks
exactly like the exit door.

413
00:21:56,960 --> 00:21:58,360
And we're supposed to
keep the closet door locked.

414
00:21:58,440 --> 00:21:59,840
We keep making all these
proclamations,

415
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:01,800
but nothing ever gets done, so...

416
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:14,720
I know what you're thinking.

417
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:17,120
I hate it when you start
a conversation like that, Arlene.

418
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:19,400
Jack, you love this woman,
I know you do.

419
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:20,360
You want my advice?

420
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,760
Because I know she loves you, too.

421
00:22:21,800 --> 00:22:25,240
She has been sucking
Phil Balow's cock, Arlene.

422
00:22:25,320 --> 00:22:26,920
Does she expect me
to ever kiss her again?

423
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:27,880
'Cause that's not gonna happen.

424
00:22:27,960 --> 00:22:29,560
You'll stop on your way home.

425
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:30,880
You'll grab some Listerine.

426
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:32,120
She'll have a nice gargle

427
00:22:32,160 --> 00:22:33,720
and then you'll figure
out a way to move on.

428
00:22:33,800 --> 00:22:35,520
That's great relationship
advice from a woman

429
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:37,560
who doesn't have a living plant
in her apartment.

430
00:22:37,600 --> 00:22:39,840
I have plants.
That Joke is so tired.

431
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:41,840
Did they send you in here
to save the Balow account?

432
00:22:41,920 --> 00:22:42,840
Is that what this is all about?

433
00:22:42,920 --> 00:22:44,920
Give me a little credit, Jack.

434
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,000
Arlene, tell the truth,
and don't get all defensive

435
00:22:47,040 --> 00:22:48,120
like you do when
you're caught in a lie.

436
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:50,080
Did they send you in here
to save the Balow account?

437
00:22:50,120 --> 00:22:51,080
Yes, but...

438
00:22:51,160 --> 00:22:52,040
- Get out.
- Jack.

439
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:53,360
- Get out.
- Fine.

440
00:22:53,440 --> 00:22:55,800
I gave it a shot.

441
00:22:55,880 --> 00:22:58,040
Thought you might want to try to act
like a human being for once.

442
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:00,320
Not today, I don't.

443
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,560
Lucky, who do you know with a truck
that can move some items fast?

444
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,360
Oh, man,
that's a good question.

445
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:13,040
I don't think I know
anybody with a truck.

446
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:16,000
My uncle's out of work.

447
00:23:16,080 --> 00:23:17,520
He's got a truck,
Bunch of buddies.

448
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:19,360
All right.

449
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:20,600
Call your uncle,
come to my office.

450
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:22,520
You're spending
the afternoon with me.

451
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:30,720
Uncle Jimmy, hey.

452
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:32,000
This is Mr. Giamoro.

453
00:23:32,080 --> 00:23:35,680
- How you doing?
- Jack knows me. Jimmy Dooley.

454
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:36,800
We grew up together.

455
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:37,760
Valley High, right?

456
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,600
I was in your brother
Anthony's class.

457
00:23:41,680 --> 00:23:43,840
Jimmy Dooley.
Right. How you doing?

458
00:23:43,880 --> 00:23:45,280
Good, good.

459
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:46,720
I mean, not as good as you.

460
00:23:46,800 --> 00:23:48,320
Big shot now.
Big cheese.

461
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:49,080
Yeah.

462
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,640
Read about you in papers.
You've got this...

463
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:54,080
You don't call anybody back, but...

464
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:55,680
Excuse me?

465
00:23:55,720 --> 00:23:57,720
You don't call anybody back.

466
00:23:57,800 --> 00:24:00,200
I called you like ten times
about my girlfriend's screenplays.

467
00:24:02,800 --> 00:24:06,040
You made me look like a dick
to my girlfriend, Jack.

468
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,600
I have a number of items
that I need you to move.

469
00:24:09,680 --> 00:24:11,680
I'll give you the address
I need them to be taken to.

470
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,520
Okay? Come with me, please.

471
00:25:19,200 --> 00:25:20,840
I'm sorry, Jack.

472
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:24,520
I know I messed up,
but I love you.

473
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:32,560
I have nothing to say to you.

474
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:35,400
Don't do this, Jack.

475
00:25:35,440 --> 00:25:36,400
Don't be like this.

476
00:25:36,440 --> 00:25:39,120
Don't throw it all away.

477
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:41,840
Stay in the fight with me.

478
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,400
Excuse me?
Sorry.

479
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:49,800
Before I go, I Just wondered
if it would be cool

480
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:51,560
if I left a headshot and resume?

481
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,000
Yeah. That's fine.
Just leave it right there.

482
00:25:53,040 --> 00:25:55,280
Cool. It's the color kind.
It's the newest thing.

483
00:25:55,360 --> 00:25:57,920
- Great. Terrific.
- Bye.

484
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:07,440
I Just wish I could
make you understand

485
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:10,280
how small and how sad it all was,

486
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,800
so you'd know how little
it all meant.

487
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,240
Your stuff will be in the garage
at your mother's.

488
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:17,120
You can do whatever
you want with it.

489
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:41,320
I'm no good at being in love.

490
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:43,800
I was in love once
when I was fourteen.

491
00:26:43,880 --> 00:26:45,480
I was a fat kid.

492
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:48,680
A fat child. A fat teen.

493
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:52,760
No one in my adult life
knows that... only Dad.

494
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,280
There was a girl at school.
Leah.

495
00:27:20,600 --> 00:27:23,240
Anthony, are you
any good at this game?

496
00:27:23,320 --> 00:27:25,960
What is it?
Monopoly? Nah.

497
00:27:26,040 --> 00:27:28,320
I don't play that.
I'm a dummy.

498
00:27:28,400 --> 00:27:29,320
Well, sit down, dummy.

499
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:31,080
We'll teach you.

500
00:27:31,160 --> 00:27:32,880
Tell your brother to sit down.

501
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,080
Yeah.

502
00:27:35,160 --> 00:27:37,040
Sit down, Anthony.

503
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:40,360
Good idea.

504
00:28:00,760 --> 00:28:02,320
End of entry.

505
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:11,120
Jack, you need to read this.

506
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,640
"Jack Giamoro immediately hired
a gaggle of low-rent movers

507
00:28:13,720 --> 00:28:16,440
to come and purge his Westside mansion
of all her belongings"?

508
00:28:16,480 --> 00:28:18,360
This is great, Lucky!

509
00:28:18,440 --> 00:28:20,200
How did they get this?

510
00:28:20,280 --> 00:28:21,960
The goddamn press!

511
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:23,120
Sheesus.

512
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:27,400
What is "Ling"?
What is that?

513
00:28:27,480 --> 00:28:29,000
Chinese? Korean? Taiwan?
What is "Ling"?

514
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:30,520
I don't know, but the name
sounds really familiar.

515
00:28:30,600 --> 00:28:32,680
- I'll find out exactly who she is.
- Do that.

516
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,040
Ling, my ass.

517
00:30:18,360 --> 00:30:22,120
It's debilitating to know that after years
of pretending you do,

518
00:30:22,200 --> 00:30:24,920
you actually don't have
the killer instinct.

519
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,480
I wanted to rip Phil's throat out last night,
but I couldn't.

520
00:30:29,480 --> 00:30:31,400
Hey, can you help me out?

521
00:30:36,440 --> 00:30:38,760
My brother Anthony
had the killer instinct.

522
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:40,840
Anthony went after
everything he ever wanted.

523
00:30:40,920 --> 00:30:42,200
Anthony was like my father.

524
00:30:42,280 --> 00:30:44,760
He was driven and had purpose.

525
00:30:48,920 --> 00:30:51,560
When you want something in life,
you have to fight for it.

526
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:58,480
Stay with it.
See it through.

527
00:30:58,560 --> 00:31:01,960
You have to be willing
to go the distance in life.

528
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:05,320
I wasn't willing to fight
the fight for Leah.

529
00:31:06,040 --> 00:31:08,160
And I couldn't go
the distance with Nina.

530
00:31:31,960 --> 00:31:34,120
What I think you are starting to see,

531
00:31:34,200 --> 00:31:35,200
if you're doing the work,

532
00:31:35,240 --> 00:31:36,320
if you're staying with the course,

533
00:31:36,400 --> 00:31:39,880
is that being honest every day,

534
00:31:39,960 --> 00:31:42,720
knowing what you think,
knowing what you feel,

535
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:45,520
is getting very revealing.

536
00:31:45,600 --> 00:31:48,640
Doors are being opened.

537
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:51,840
Boxes that have not been rummaged in
for quite some time

538
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:53,040
are being looked through.

539
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:58,080
Later, as we wind the course down
and I read your Journals,

540
00:31:58,160 --> 00:31:59,840
I should know you intimately,

541
00:31:59,920 --> 00:32:02,400
perhaps better than
anyone else knows you,

542
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:03,640
except, of course, yourself.

543
00:32:03,720 --> 00:32:05,120
- Excuse me.
- Sir.

544
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:07,080
What do you mean,
read our Journals?

545
00:32:07,120 --> 00:32:09,360
I don't think that's
gonna work for me.

546
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:11,400
I'm a very private person.

547
00:32:11,480 --> 00:32:13,520
Okay. But you may as well leave now,

548
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:17,520
because there is really
no point in your staying.

549
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:19,080
Well, it's not that.
I'm Just not that comfortable.

550
00:32:19,160 --> 00:32:22,960
I'm not interested
in your comfort.

551
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:25,920
I'm not an anesthetist,
I'm a doctor.

552
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,600
I do not get cheap thrills
reading someone's Journal.

553
00:32:29,680 --> 00:32:36,760
I am here to give you the tools
to help you to uncover...

554
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:43,000
...discover,

555
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:47,040
and discard...

556
00:32:47,120 --> 00:32:49,720
the crap that is
holding you back.

557
00:32:50,520 --> 00:32:51,720
And you, sir,

558
00:32:51,800 --> 00:32:54,520
definitely have crap
that is holding you back.

559
00:32:56,080 --> 00:33:00,720
"If a way to the better there be,
it exacts a full look at the worst."

560
00:33:00,760 --> 00:33:02,280
Thomas Hardy.

561
00:33:02,360 --> 00:33:03,200
Who?

562
00:33:03,280 --> 00:33:05,320
Who is Thomas Hardy?
Is that what you're asking?

563
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:06,880
Yes, I am.

564
00:33:06,960 --> 00:33:08,960
Are you not a college man,
Mr. Giamoro?

565
00:33:09,560 --> 00:33:11,440
Community college.
Two years.

566
00:33:11,480 --> 00:33:13,960
But I believe education
can only take you so far.

567
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,440
Quite right.

568
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:17,480
Absolutely true.

569
00:33:17,520 --> 00:33:19,960
But ego...

570
00:33:26,040 --> 00:33:27,920
...will not get you
the rest of the way.

571
00:33:27,960 --> 00:33:29,960
It will feed you, yes.

572
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:32,160
It will clothe you well.

573
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:36,920
But it will leave you cold and alone
and unknowing, I promise.

574
00:33:38,000 --> 00:33:40,280
But if you would prefer to leave,
please go.

575
00:33:41,840 --> 00:33:43,960
- I don't choose to leave.
- Very well.

576
00:33:44,040 --> 00:33:45,880
So, when I ask you
to turn in your Journal

577
00:33:45,960 --> 00:33:50,080
for me and me alone
to read, Just do it.

578
00:33:50,160 --> 00:33:51,280
And remember the spelling!

579
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:53,160
It's a thing with me.

580
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,360
Hey, don't worry.

581
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:15,600
We're gonna get this guy.

582
00:34:15,640 --> 00:34:17,760
We'll mess him up real good.

583
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:19,280
Teach him a lesson.

584
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:22,040
He needs one.
Playing gatekeeper.

585
00:34:22,680 --> 00:34:25,680
All these people deciding
who does and doesn't get in.

586
00:34:27,680 --> 00:34:30,040
You've been wronged,
so I'm going to fix it.

587
00:34:39,800 --> 00:34:41,040
- Hello?
- Jack.

588
00:34:41,080 --> 00:34:42,000
Hey, man, look, it's Phil.

589
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:44,000
We need to talk.

590
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:45,760
What do we need to
talk about, Phil?

591
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:48,320
Come on, man.
Don't be an asshole, okay?

592
00:34:48,400 --> 00:34:52,560
I'm sorry.
I feel like shit.

593
00:34:52,600 --> 00:34:54,800
I want to see you.

594
00:34:54,840 --> 00:34:56,080
It's 8:02, Phil.

595
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:57,640
I'm running late.

596
00:35:03,840 --> 00:35:05,360
I don't want to talk to him!

597
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:06,600
I won't ever talk to him again!

598
00:35:06,680 --> 00:35:08,280
You sit down here.
Okay?

599
00:35:08,320 --> 00:35:10,600
Now I really do not want
to hear any more about this.

600
00:35:10,680 --> 00:35:12,320
Of all the girls in the world,

601
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:14,520
you had to steal one
from your baby brother?

602
00:35:14,600 --> 00:35:17,200
You should be ashamed!

603
00:35:17,280 --> 00:35:18,800
Anthony!

604
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:25,720
I Just don't want to come home

605
00:35:25,800 --> 00:35:28,360
and listen to the same garbage
every night.

606
00:35:28,440 --> 00:35:30,360
I come home from work,
I got a headache.

607
00:35:30,400 --> 00:35:33,080
I've been shit on all day,
and then I have to listen

608
00:35:33,160 --> 00:35:35,160
to this crap night after night!

609
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:36,600
I don't understand why!

610
00:35:36,640 --> 00:35:38,560
Anthony needs to do
the right thing!

611
00:35:38,640 --> 00:35:39,600
Oh, come on!

612
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:42,560
I am taking him over to her house
to talk this out with her parents!

613
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,240
Anthony,
open this door now!

614
00:35:44,320 --> 00:35:46,280
Leave the kid alone!
You're driving me nuts!

615
00:35:46,360 --> 00:35:49,120
Get down those stairs
and get out in that car right now!

616
00:35:49,920 --> 00:35:51,800
You stay out of this!

617
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,200
My mother never forgave my father

618
00:35:53,280 --> 00:35:56,840
for letting the failure of his career
destroy his happiness at home.

619
00:35:58,080 --> 00:35:59,760
She never forgave him
for putting a wall up

620
00:35:59,840 --> 00:36:01,600
between himself
and his two sons.

621
00:36:01,680 --> 00:36:02,720
You only care about Jack!

622
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:04,280
My father never forgave me

623
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:06,680
for not being thin and focused,

624
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:09,120
combative and determined
like Anthony.

625
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:10,120
Between you
and your father...

626
00:36:16,720 --> 00:36:18,560
And for the rest of her life,

627
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:23,200
he never forgave my mother
for killing Anthony.

628
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,040
Why the hell should I
have to forgive Nina?

629
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:40,240
- You've got about a hundred calls.
- David Lilly?

630
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:42,000
No, but I did figure out
who Barbi Ling is.

631
00:36:42,080 --> 00:36:44,600
<i>She writes freelance hatchet pieces
for the L.A. Voice.</i>

632
00:36:44,680 --> 00:36:46,000
Most of them are
maJor players in town.

633
00:36:46,040 --> 00:36:47,680
She did the Sherry Lansing piece.

634
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,200
- Figures.
- It gets worse.

635
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:51,440
She's a screenwriter
and was a stand-up comic.

636
00:36:51,520 --> 00:36:53,280
You know, one of them
Comedy Store wanna-bes?

637
00:36:53,360 --> 00:36:55,280
She submitted ten scripts
within the last five years.

638
00:36:55,360 --> 00:36:56,480
We reJected them all.

639
00:36:56,560 --> 00:36:57,600
She couldn't make it in this town

640
00:36:57,680 --> 00:36:58,800
and decided to tear down
the people who did, right?

641
00:36:58,880 --> 00:36:59,840
It gets worse.

642
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:00,920
Would you stop saying that, please?

643
00:37:01,000 --> 00:37:02,520
You sound like a bit player
on a Dick Wolf show.

644
00:37:02,600 --> 00:37:04,720
<i>She sold a full profile to the L.A. Voice.</i>

645
00:37:04,760 --> 00:37:06,080
The one last week was
Just a teaser.

646
00:37:06,160 --> 00:37:07,560
She's doing a whole thing
on you, Jack...

647
00:37:07,640 --> 00:37:09,200
the evolution of the agency,
the stealing of clients.

648
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:11,120
Please tell me that's not true.

649
00:37:11,160 --> 00:37:12,400
- I can't.
- Jack.

650
00:37:12,480 --> 00:37:13,520
We need you in your office.

651
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,280
Right now.

652
00:37:15,320 --> 00:37:18,000
Jack, it's important.

653
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:18,880
Phil called.

654
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:20,120
He wants to sit down with you

655
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:21,320
or he's threatened
to leave the agency.

656
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:22,360
You need to have lunch with him.

657
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:23,880
I'm not sitting down with Phil.

658
00:37:23,960 --> 00:37:25,120
Nina called me, too.

659
00:37:25,200 --> 00:37:26,760
She's destroyed.
You need to see her.

660
00:37:26,840 --> 00:37:27,920
I'm worried about her.

661
00:37:27,960 --> 00:37:29,440
Then you see her.

662
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,040
Hey, get this Ling
on the phone, will ya?

663
00:37:33,120 --> 00:37:34,160
Jack, you need to do something.

664
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:35,920
He will leave the agency.

665
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,160
Jack, here's how bad
I want you to have lunch with Phil.

666
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:40,200
Are you ready?

667
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:46,280
I will sign your cousin Andrew's no-talent,
acne-scarred daughter.

668
00:37:46,360 --> 00:37:48,080
Okay?

669
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:52,760
- Call him.
- Jack, Barbi Ling on line 3.

670
00:37:54,120 --> 00:37:56,560
Barbi Ling, how are you?

671
00:37:56,600 --> 00:37:57,880
I'm fine, Mr. Giamoro.

672
00:37:57,920 --> 00:37:58,960
What can I do for you?

673
00:37:59,040 --> 00:38:01,400
Well, I think that you
and I should sit down

674
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:02,400
and have a meal together.

675
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,080
Why? Do I sound hungry?

676
00:38:05,120 --> 00:38:07,880
In fact, when you called,
I was having a meal.

677
00:38:07,960 --> 00:38:09,720
Well, if you're like me,

678
00:38:09,760 --> 00:38:12,600
eventually you'll have another one.

679
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:13,640
Listen to me, Barbi.

680
00:38:13,720 --> 00:38:15,720
I promise you,
you need me close on this, okay?

681
00:38:15,800 --> 00:38:16,880
Profiles need information.

682
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:18,480
I can get you to who
you need to get to

683
00:38:18,560 --> 00:38:20,680
so you can get
this thing done right.

684
00:38:20,760 --> 00:38:21,840
Are we done?

685
00:38:21,880 --> 00:38:24,360
Barbi, I'm being nice now.

686
00:38:24,440 --> 00:38:26,440
This is the nice Jack
that you're talking to.

687
00:38:26,520 --> 00:38:28,720
I know.
And I'm so very lucky.

688
00:38:28,800 --> 00:38:32,480
Oh, look!
My food's here.

689
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:36,280
Fun meeting you,
nice Jack.

690
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:41,200
I'm not good with the word "no."

691
00:38:41,280 --> 00:38:43,040
I never have been.

692
00:38:44,600 --> 00:38:48,280
I worked at the world-famous
Cameron Merrick Agency.

693
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:51,040
Morty, Arlene and I
all started in the mailroom together.

694
00:38:51,120 --> 00:38:52,360
We were young and hungry

695
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:54,680
and had the power
of determination.

696
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:59,320
Once I found the business,
I knew I was gonna succeed.

697
00:38:59,360 --> 00:39:01,880
I saw myself
succeeding so clearly

698
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:03,800
that it became
a moment in time

699
00:39:03,840 --> 00:39:06,840
that I had but simply
to wait and prepare for.

700
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:10,120
Like a bus scheduled into the station
at a preordained moment,

701
00:39:10,200 --> 00:39:14,280
I moved forward with confidence
that my day would surely arrive.

702
00:39:14,360 --> 00:39:16,920
And when the time came
to make a play,

703
00:39:16,960 --> 00:39:18,400
I made a play.

704
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:22,040
As our bosses before us had done,
we formed a new group,

705
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:24,320
took most of our clients,
and left the agency.

706
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:27,240
But first we copied all their secrets

707
00:39:27,320 --> 00:39:30,200
so we'd have something to blackmail them with
if they ever came after us.

708
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:35,000
It was ruthless and bold,
a mailroom coup,

709
00:39:35,040 --> 00:39:37,440
a time-honored
show business tradition.

710
00:39:48,800 --> 00:39:51,200
Change is coming around again now.

711
00:39:52,000 --> 00:39:53,440
I can feel it.

712
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:17,720
Dad?

713
00:40:28,280 --> 00:40:29,640
Dad?

714
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:36,800
Goddamn it!

715
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:06,760
Hi.

716
00:42:09,960 --> 00:42:11,360
Is he gonna be okay?

717
00:42:12,520 --> 00:42:14,680
He's banged up.

718
00:42:14,760 --> 00:42:16,840
He's got a couple
fractured ribs.

719
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,800
Pretty bad cut
on his back.

720
00:42:19,880 --> 00:42:20,520
He's gonna
need to see a dentist.

721
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,440
His teeth are pretty bad.

722
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,040
It's not a problem, Jack.

723
00:42:26,600 --> 00:42:28,600
I've got the best guy
in Beverly Hills.

724
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,720
And Jack, the best thing about it is,
you won't feel a thing.

725
00:42:31,760 --> 00:42:33,880
This guy will have you
on so much dope.

726
00:42:33,960 --> 00:42:35,840
You're gonna love this guy.

727
00:42:51,920 --> 00:42:52,840
Wait a minute!

728
00:42:52,920 --> 00:42:55,200
He's not a dentist!
He's a comedy writer!

729
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:57,040
This guy's a comedy writer!

730
00:42:57,120 --> 00:42:59,080
Okay, we better up that dosage, please.
Thank you.

731
00:43:13,400 --> 00:43:17,040
Who let...
Who let the whore in?

732
00:43:17,080 --> 00:43:18,800
You're a whore!

733
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,360
She broke the bonds
of our matrimony!

734
00:43:21,400 --> 00:43:23,280
You screwed my biggest client!

735
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:25,600
Why couldn't you screw Garry Marshall?
He's about to retire!

736
00:43:25,680 --> 00:43:28,160
You had to screw
a working client!

737
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:29,360
That's good!

738
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:32,600
I'll be in the waiting room.

739
00:44:30,320 --> 00:44:32,640
Morty, he's here!
Morty!

740
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:34,640
Okay, good.
Did you tell Arlene?

741
00:44:34,720 --> 00:44:35,880
- Yeah, she knows.
- Okay.

742
00:44:35,960 --> 00:44:36,880
I'm here.
Where's Fineberg?

743
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:38,160
He's on his way.

744
00:44:38,240 --> 00:44:39,840
- Okay.
- Okay.

745
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:41,240
Nobody mentions the teeth.
Okay?

746
00:44:41,320 --> 00:44:42,200
Come on.
Come on, come on.

747
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:44,440
Talk about his quick recovery.
Talk about how good he looks.

748
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:45,520
- Come on.
- He likes that.

749
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,040
Okay, quick! Thank you.

750
00:44:47,120 --> 00:44:48,520
Everybody upbeat? Okay.

751
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:07,760
So, how you doing, Jack?

752
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:10,400
How you think I'm doing?

753
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,560
I look like a goddamn xylophone!

754
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:16,120
Jack, Kevin Sands is
the best in the business.

755
00:45:16,200 --> 00:45:17,600
He does all the big names.

756
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:19,480
You were in
so much pain and so wild.

757
00:45:19,560 --> 00:45:21,360
He did the best he could.

758
00:45:21,440 --> 00:45:24,480
I look like Tom Cruise's retarded cousin.

759
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:27,280
Jack, what did the cops say?

760
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:29,160
Did they find anything?

761
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:32,360
No. Guy got away.

762
00:45:32,400 --> 00:45:33,920
They have no idea who he was.

763
00:45:34,000 --> 00:45:36,840
Well, the important thing
is that you're back, right?

764
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:39,360
Yep, I'm back!

765
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,400
All right, I'll see you guys.

766
00:48:00,480 --> 00:48:02,160
Maria?

767
00:48:06,160 --> 00:48:08,320
Have you seen my Journal?

768
00:48:12,120 --> 00:48:13,640
Maria!

769
00:48:24,120 --> 00:48:26,160
My home was broken into
and it was stolen.

770
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:27,840
I haven't had an entry
in three weeks.

771
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,320
So, what's your plan?

772
00:48:31,080 --> 00:48:32,360
I don't know.

773
00:48:32,440 --> 00:48:33,320
You don't know?

774
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:34,880
You haven't been to
class for three weeks

775
00:48:34,960 --> 00:48:36,600
and now you
don't have a Journal,

776
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:39,040
after you didn't want me
to read it anyway,

777
00:48:39,120 --> 00:48:41,280
and when I ask you
what your plan is,

778
00:48:41,360 --> 00:48:42,320
you say...

779
00:48:42,360 --> 00:48:47,800
"I don't know."

780
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,440
Do you think I'm lying?

781
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:50,520
I've had a very
difficult few weeks.

782
00:48:50,600 --> 00:48:52,800
Which, of course,
you did not write about.

783
00:48:52,880 --> 00:48:56,880
Mr. Giamoro, tell me honestly.

784
00:48:56,920 --> 00:48:58,480
Why don't you drop out?

785
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,040
I mean, why are you here?

786
00:49:00,120 --> 00:49:01,880
To taunt me?

787
00:49:02,840 --> 00:49:03,880
It's not my way to drop out.

788
00:49:03,960 --> 00:49:04,880
Yes, yes, yes.

789
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:08,320
But why are you here in this class?

790
00:49:11,080 --> 00:49:12,560
I don't know.

791
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:17,000
I Just had an idea.

792
00:49:17,080 --> 00:49:19,080
Why don't you write about that?

793
00:49:19,160 --> 00:49:22,640
Or would that be too much bother?

794
00:49:24,120 --> 00:49:26,080
You don't have the right
to talk to me that way.

795
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:28,200
Great! Write about that!

796
00:49:28,280 --> 00:49:30,360
Write about how
you cannot stand me,

797
00:49:30,440 --> 00:49:32,600
how you'd like to pop me
right in the kisser,

798
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,200
how you'd like to
punch me on the snoot!

799
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:36,520
Write about it in
great color and detail!

800
00:49:36,600 --> 00:49:39,080
Am I hitting a little
nerve here, Jackie?

801
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:41,800
Fill those pages!
Go out!

802
00:49:41,880 --> 00:49:45,400
Get a new Journal and fill the pages!

803
00:49:45,480 --> 00:49:51,040
Write about it.

804
00:49:52,320 --> 00:49:53,280
Yes?

805
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:55,920
Okay.

806
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:58,720
Thank you.

807
00:50:03,880 --> 00:50:07,360
I miss that time in my life,
when I was fearless,

808
00:50:07,440 --> 00:50:09,720
when the ground
was mine and I stood it,

809
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:12,960
when I was bullheaded like my dad,
and I was always right.

810
00:50:14,600 --> 00:50:16,680
Mr. Giamoro,
I have told you before

811
00:50:16,760 --> 00:50:18,520
that you cannot
make these outbursts.

812
00:50:18,560 --> 00:50:23,280
I will see that you do a night in Jail
for contempt if this happens again.

813
00:50:23,360 --> 00:50:24,920
Your Honor, give me a night.
That's fine.

814
00:50:25,000 --> 00:50:27,400
But Just hear me out,
because this is important to understand.

815
00:50:27,480 --> 00:50:29,800
We built this company, okay?

816
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:31,200
We put our souls into it.

817
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:32,960
We made it what it is!

818
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,080
And now that it's worth something,
ten years later,

819
00:50:35,160 --> 00:50:37,280
our former employers
want to rip it to shit!

820
00:50:37,320 --> 00:50:39,520
Okay, I'm sorry.
Bailiff!

821
00:50:39,560 --> 00:50:41,280
You Just bought yourself
a night in Jail.

822
00:50:41,360 --> 00:50:42,720
Wait a minute!
Hold on a second!

823
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,440
Ten years is too late
to come along

824
00:50:45,480 --> 00:50:48,520
and throw the lives of
110 people into the gutter!

825
00:50:48,600 --> 00:50:50,360
It's not right, goddamn it!

826
00:50:50,440 --> 00:50:53,520
Get off me!
I can walk out on my own!

827
00:50:53,640 --> 00:50:55,400
I can walk out on my own!

828
00:50:57,200 --> 00:51:01,960
I was always ready to explode
if I thought you needed to learn a lesson,

829
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:06,280
if I thought you were in the way of me,
the way I needed things to be.

830
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:15,320
You're a fool.

831
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,280
Yes, I know that.

832
00:51:17,320 --> 00:51:18,880
But damn, were you cute.

833
00:51:18,920 --> 00:51:20,520
Wow. I mean...

834
00:51:20,600 --> 00:51:23,320
That all changed for me, though.

835
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:26,840
It changed a little bit
every time Nina kissed me.

836
00:51:26,920 --> 00:51:30,080
Jack, the Jury went our way.

837
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:31,360
What?

838
00:51:31,400 --> 00:51:33,120
We won, Jack.

839
00:51:33,200 --> 00:51:35,160
- We won?
- We won.

840
00:51:38,520 --> 00:51:40,480
Oh, my God!

841
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:50,560
The winning streak continued.

842
00:51:50,600 --> 00:51:52,360
The agency grew.

843
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,440
Things got sweet.

844
00:52:02,520 --> 00:52:07,200
The little moments took light
and the darkness lost ground.

845
00:52:08,360 --> 00:52:12,800
Promises were made
and dreams were laid out.

846
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:17,600
The air in my world
had a preciousness to it then,

847
00:52:17,640 --> 00:52:22,360
a peace that time would show
I didn't know how to negotiate with.

848
00:52:27,120 --> 00:52:30,000
The deal of a lifetime,

849
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,280
and I couldn't close it.

850
00:52:34,840 --> 00:52:36,440
Jack, Barbi Ling's calling.

851
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:40,480
Yeah, I want her.

852
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:41,960
What can I do for you, Barbi?

853
00:52:42,040 --> 00:52:44,800
I need some filler
material for my story.

854
00:52:44,880 --> 00:52:46,520
I have reams of stuff now,

855
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:49,760
but I need to get the Juice
in between the Juice.

856
00:52:49,840 --> 00:52:50,880
What kind of Juice?

857
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,560
About the early days
of your company.

858
00:52:52,640 --> 00:52:54,120
The break-in, maybe.

859
00:52:54,160 --> 00:52:56,640
The files you and Arlene
and Morty stole

860
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,680
and were gonna bribe
your old bosses with.

861
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:00,560
You have my Journal?

862
00:53:00,600 --> 00:53:02,120
Is that it, Barbi?

863
00:53:02,200 --> 00:53:04,360
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

864
00:53:04,400 --> 00:53:07,360
But are you still hungry
for a meal with me?

865
00:53:07,440 --> 00:53:08,800
I'm famished.

866
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:11,120
Rickshaw Inn,
downtown on Broadway.

867
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:12,160
Do you know it?

868
00:53:12,240 --> 00:53:13,160
Chinatown. Yeah.

869
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:15,120
My family used to eat there
on Sundays when I was a boy.

870
00:53:15,160 --> 00:53:18,800
I'll see you there
for dinner tomorrow night, 6:00.

871
00:53:26,520 --> 00:53:28,240
Get out! Get out!

872
00:53:28,320 --> 00:53:29,760
I don't care how busy he is!

873
00:53:29,840 --> 00:53:32,120
Get me an appointment
with that goddamn dentist!

874
00:54:40,800 --> 00:54:42,080
What the fuck?

875
00:54:55,600 --> 00:54:57,080
Where is my Journal?

876
00:54:57,720 --> 00:54:58,680
Fuck you!

877
00:55:06,360 --> 00:55:07,880
What's the deal with your teeth?

878
00:55:27,800 --> 00:55:30,160
You hold people back.

879
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:31,800
Bunch of rich white men.

880
00:55:31,880 --> 00:55:32,840
Rich white gatekeepers.

881
00:55:32,920 --> 00:55:34,680
What?

882
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:39,520
Is that the line she gave you

883
00:55:39,600 --> 00:55:43,480
to get you to break into my house,
leave me for dead?

884
00:55:43,560 --> 00:55:46,800
Let me tell you something, Jimmy.

885
00:55:46,880 --> 00:55:50,360
You've got nothing out there
protecting you.

886
00:55:50,400 --> 00:55:51,800
There's nothing.

887
00:55:52,640 --> 00:55:54,320
No security. No gate.

888
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:56,800
No hidden camera.
No patrols.

889
00:55:56,880 --> 00:55:58,400
Anybody can Just walk in off the street

890
00:55:58,480 --> 00:56:00,880
and put a cap in
the back of your head.

891
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:02,040
Now where's my Journal?

892
00:56:02,080 --> 00:56:03,440
And don't say, "Fuck you,"

893
00:56:03,520 --> 00:56:05,360
'cause if you do,
I will shoot you

894
00:56:05,440 --> 00:56:08,120
and I will take your piece of shit TV
and I will walk out of here,

895
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:10,680
and the cops will Just figure
it was a robbery gone bad.

896
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:12,760
Where is my Journal?

897
00:56:12,840 --> 00:56:15,920
All you had to do
was answer my calls,

898
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:17,360
read her scripts.

899
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:18,840
But no, you couldn't do that.

900
00:56:18,920 --> 00:56:20,120
You're too big time, huh?

901
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,840
You're never gonna
see that Journal again.

902
00:56:41,440 --> 00:56:43,600
Hi. I need to see
Dr. Sands right away.

903
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:46,080
He's with a patient, sir.

904
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:47,800
Okay, that doesn't
work for me, so...

905
00:56:47,880 --> 00:56:51,040
- Maybe you should have a seat or...
- It's fine. Don't worry about it.

906
00:56:51,080 --> 00:56:52,080
Dr. Sands!

907
00:56:56,160 --> 00:56:57,200
Excuse me, sir.
I'm sorry.

908
00:56:57,280 --> 00:56:59,520
We're going to reschedule
your appointment to a later date.

909
00:56:59,560 --> 00:57:02,040
Would you mind stepping out
to the waiting room?

910
00:57:02,120 --> 00:57:04,040
The receptionist will
take care of you.

911
00:57:04,120 --> 00:57:06,600
Sir, we're done with you.

912
00:57:07,360 --> 00:57:08,800
Do these look
like teeth to you?

913
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:10,520
I can fix them.
You wouldn't sit still.

914
00:57:10,560 --> 00:57:11,840
I couldn't get the mold right.
But I can fix them.

915
00:57:11,880 --> 00:57:13,240
Goddamn right
you can fix them.

916
00:57:13,280 --> 00:57:15,440
Cancel his appointments
for the rest of the day.

917
00:57:17,000 --> 00:57:19,520
Get fixing, Skippy.

918
00:57:24,160 --> 00:57:26,200
No one knows what
we're talking about, okay?

919
00:57:26,280 --> 00:57:27,200
Try to act professional.

920
00:57:27,280 --> 00:57:28,240
I'll try.

921
00:57:28,320 --> 00:57:29,440
Hey, Arlene!

922
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:32,160
You ever eat at the Rickshaw Inn
in Chinatown?

923
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:34,160
Yeah, years ago. Why?

924
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:36,480
I'm having dinner there
tonight at 6:00.

925
00:57:36,520 --> 00:57:38,240
After that, I've got
a little something planned.

926
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:39,920
And after that,

927
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:41,920
everything's gonna be back
to normal, I promise you.

928
00:57:42,000 --> 00:57:43,440
Who are you having dinner with
in Chinatown?

929
00:57:43,520 --> 00:57:44,880
Hey, do you like these?

930
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,040
They're temps.
They hurt like hell.

931
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:02,160
Maybe he's having dinner here with Phil.

932
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:03,760
Maybe they patched it up.

933
00:58:04,160 --> 00:58:05,360
Maybe he's here
to sign the tooth fairy.

934
00:58:05,400 --> 00:58:06,880
You got a better shot at that.

935
00:58:07,520 --> 00:58:09,160
I'd take ten percent
of the tooth fairy.

936
00:58:09,240 --> 00:58:10,640
Who owns the tooth fairy?

937
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:11,680
Yeah. Is it public domain?

938
00:58:11,760 --> 00:58:13,440
That's not a bad idea.
Find out.

939
00:58:18,840 --> 00:58:20,400
He's here. He's here.
He's here.

940
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:29,040
Mr. Giamoro.
How are you doing?

941
00:58:29,120 --> 00:58:31,600
The Asian girl from Primkin's class.

942
00:58:31,680 --> 00:58:33,840
Yep. The Asian girl.

943
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:36,200
So, what came first,
the class or the story?

944
00:58:36,280 --> 00:58:37,840
The story.

945
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,400
Who's that girl?

946
00:58:39,480 --> 00:58:40,440
I have no idea.

947
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:45,720
Who tipped you off?
Arlene's assistant?

948
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:47,280
Dooley's nephew?

949
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:48,920
Here's a question.

950
00:58:49,000 --> 00:58:51,800
Why are you in a class like that,
a guy like you?

951
00:58:53,680 --> 00:58:55,160
Well, to be honest with you, Barbi,

952
00:58:55,240 --> 00:58:58,960
I think I took that class
for two reasons.

953
00:58:59,000 --> 00:59:01,440
One, I wanted to
expand my horizons.

954
00:59:01,520 --> 00:59:05,000
And two...
and there's some irony in this...

955
00:59:05,080 --> 00:59:06,520
was to meet people like you.

956
00:59:08,120 --> 00:59:09,080
Here's a question.

957
00:59:09,160 --> 00:59:10,840
Why'd you pick this shit hole?

958
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:13,320
It's the worst restaurant
in Chinatown.

959
00:59:13,400 --> 00:59:15,880
My family owns it.

960
00:59:15,960 --> 00:59:17,480
That's my father at the register.

961
00:59:17,560 --> 00:59:20,040
And all the busboys and waiters
are my brothers,

962
00:59:20,120 --> 00:59:22,400
my cousins and my uncles.

963
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,280
Well, okay.
Let's get past that.

964
00:59:26,360 --> 00:59:29,200
I want my Journal back, Barbi,
and I want you to call your editor

965
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:31,480
and tell him you're not
going ahead with the story.

966
00:59:31,560 --> 00:59:33,240
Here's a little tip.

967
00:59:33,320 --> 00:59:36,960
Tearing down other people
who worked hard to get where they are

968
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:39,640
is not a way to
advance your career.

969
00:59:41,240 --> 00:59:42,240
My Journal, please.

970
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:54,160
No, no! That's...

971
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,440
No! You... no, no!

972
00:59:57,520 --> 00:59:58,480
No!

973
00:59:58,560 --> 00:59:59,960
Give me my Journal!

974
01:00:03,360 --> 01:00:05,800
Jack! Jack!
What the hell's going on?

975
01:00:05,880 --> 01:00:07,480
Who is that girl, Jack?

976
01:00:07,520 --> 01:00:10,040
- Whoa! Jeez!
- Sorry!

977
01:00:10,120 --> 01:00:12,480
Jeez, I'm sorry.
Sorry.

978
01:00:20,320 --> 01:00:22,720
Why are these people
chasing us, you asshole?

979
01:00:22,760 --> 01:00:23,720
I'll tell you later.

980
01:00:25,440 --> 01:00:26,720
Jeez!

981
01:00:28,160 --> 01:00:29,440
Aw, Jack!

982
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:40,960
Give me the Journal, Jack.

983
01:00:41,920 --> 01:00:43,920
- That's what she wants?
- You gave your Journal to her?

984
01:00:44,000 --> 01:00:44,920
Give it to her!
Give it to her!

985
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:46,280
- Give it to her!
- Wait a second!

986
01:01:18,920 --> 01:01:20,160
Fuck it, abort.

987
01:01:30,920 --> 01:01:32,000
Yeah?

988
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:34,560
Okay, I'll take him, but quick!

989
01:01:35,000 --> 01:01:35,840
Hey.

990
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,160
I had my Journal
in my hands today,

991
01:01:43,240 --> 01:01:44,720
and I lost it.

992
01:01:44,800 --> 01:01:46,640
Morty fell,
things went sideways,

993
01:01:46,720 --> 01:01:49,280
confusion ruled, and one of her uncles
picked it up.

994
01:01:50,440 --> 01:01:53,880
Barbi Ling
has my Journal once again.

995
01:01:58,600 --> 01:02:01,960
I headed home knowing
I needed to do something to change my luck,

996
01:02:02,040 --> 01:02:04,440
so I drove to David Lilly's
in Brentwood.

997
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:08,400
It was time to Jumpstart the beast,
and I knew Just how to do it.

998
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:31,800
Hello there, neighbor!

999
01:02:31,880 --> 01:02:33,720
Just me, Jack Giamoro,

1000
01:02:33,800 --> 01:02:36,120
your friendly
neighborhood IAA agent.

1001
01:02:36,200 --> 01:02:37,560
What is this?

1002
01:02:37,640 --> 01:02:40,200
David, I'm gonna
make a speech. Okay?

1003
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:41,560
At the end of this speech,

1004
01:02:41,640 --> 01:02:43,480
one of two things is
gonna take place.

1005
01:02:43,560 --> 01:02:46,640
Either I'm gonna represent you
or I'm going to Jail.

1006
01:02:46,720 --> 01:02:48,520
So, hear me out.

1007
01:02:49,760 --> 01:02:53,560
David Lilly,
I want to be your agent.

1008
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,160
I can make the deals
with the studios

1009
01:02:55,240 --> 01:02:56,640
that you need to have made.

1010
01:02:56,720 --> 01:02:59,360
I will have the studio people
over here catering to you.

1011
01:02:59,440 --> 01:03:01,320
I will have them
doing your yard work.

1012
01:03:01,400 --> 01:03:04,080
I will have them
cleaning out your litter box.

1013
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:05,480
I want to make you
so much money

1014
01:03:05,560 --> 01:03:08,760
that it will screw up your kids
and your grandkids.

1015
01:03:08,840 --> 01:03:12,400
I am bone-marrow hungry
to be your agent.

1016
01:03:15,720 --> 01:03:16,920
That's it.

1017
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:18,320
What do you think?

1018
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,680
Ask him if he'll
represent an actress.

1019
01:03:21,720 --> 01:03:23,920
I want this guy
repping me, too.

1020
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:27,160
Okay, fine.

1021
01:03:27,240 --> 01:03:28,320
You're my agent.
You're my agent.

1022
01:03:28,400 --> 01:03:30,920
Just get off my lawn
before the cops come.

1023
01:03:32,600 --> 01:03:33,560
Yes!

1024
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:36,880
You're not gonna regret this.
Thank you. Thank you!

1025
01:03:36,920 --> 01:03:40,240
I'm very excited.
Very excited!

1026
01:03:48,760 --> 01:03:53,360
Jack, we need an explanation.
You need to come clean with us.

1027
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:56,480
Listen, I can't let her
have that Journal.

1028
01:03:56,560 --> 01:03:57,960
This is the woman who's responsible
for the break-in at my house.

1029
01:03:58,000 --> 01:03:59,280
She can't have that Journal.

1030
01:03:59,360 --> 01:04:01,040
Why not? Why can't you let her
have the Journal, Jack?

1031
01:04:01,080 --> 01:04:02,120
What's in the Journal?

1032
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:07,760
She's doing a story on me,
on the agency, our work, et cetera.

1033
01:04:07,800 --> 01:04:09,520
Oh, God.

1034
01:04:09,560 --> 01:04:14,600
And the Journal contains, you know,
it's private information.

1035
01:04:14,640 --> 01:04:17,040
But, other than that,
everything is fine.

1036
01:04:17,120 --> 01:04:18,600
And there's good news
regarding David Lilly.

1037
01:04:18,680 --> 01:04:20,240
What's in the Journal, Jack?

1038
01:04:20,320 --> 01:04:21,560
I'm taking care of it, okay?

1039
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,240
Jack, what's in the Journal?

1040
01:04:30,280 --> 01:04:32,320
Information that directly
contradicts our testimony

1041
01:04:32,400 --> 01:04:33,760
at the competition trial...

1042
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:37,200
as well as some personal stuff.

1043
01:04:37,240 --> 01:04:39,000
You know, my feelings
about the size of my dick

1044
01:04:39,080 --> 01:04:40,360
and stuff like that.

1045
01:04:41,440 --> 01:04:45,400
So, Barbi, as we
discussed on the phone,

1046
01:04:45,480 --> 01:04:47,160
we all wanted to
get together with you

1047
01:04:47,240 --> 01:04:49,200
to talk about the scripts
that you submitted.

1048
01:04:49,240 --> 01:04:50,560
Five years ago.

1049
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:52,080
Please don't
take that personally.

1050
01:04:52,160 --> 01:04:53,720
We are looking at ways

1051
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:55,000
of speeding up
our reading department.

1052
01:04:55,080 --> 01:04:57,040
As head of the future lit department,
I gotta tell you,

1053
01:04:57,120 --> 01:04:58,680
I really think you have
an incredible body of work.

1054
01:04:58,760 --> 01:05:00,600
- Really?
- Absolutely.

1055
01:05:00,640 --> 01:05:03,760
- Awesome.
- Wow, how nice.

1056
01:05:04,920 --> 01:05:08,240
Which one do you like the best?

1057
01:05:08,280 --> 01:05:09,240
Well, to be honest with you,

1058
01:05:09,320 --> 01:05:10,920
<i>probably
Chinese Girl on a Killing SPree</i>

1059
01:05:11,000 --> 01:05:12,400
would be my favorite.

1060
01:05:12,440 --> 01:05:13,880
Good one. Really edgy.

1061
01:05:13,920 --> 01:05:15,800
<i>Planet Without Jews
was an interesting read.</i>

1062
01:05:15,880 --> 01:05:17,040
Phenomenal.
Phenomenal.

1063
01:05:17,080 --> 01:05:19,520
- Wow, thank you.
- You're very talented.

1064
01:05:19,600 --> 01:05:22,640
Barbi, the point is,
we would love,

1065
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,920
love to have you as a client.

1066
01:05:25,000 --> 01:05:26,680
A client?

1067
01:05:26,760 --> 01:05:29,480
Yes. Yes.
Yes, we would be honored.

1068
01:05:29,560 --> 01:05:31,960
- Absolutely.
- Thank you.

1069
01:05:33,800 --> 01:05:36,280
Which one of my scripts
was your favorite, Jack?

1070
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,720
You read them all, right?

1071
01:05:42,560 --> 01:05:44,800
Every one of them.
Read them all.

1072
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:47,240
How nice.

1073
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:52,280
How does an agency work?
You take ten percent?

1074
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:53,560
I'm Just curious.

1075
01:05:53,600 --> 01:05:55,680
Ten percent.
But, you know, really,

1076
01:05:55,760 --> 01:05:57,080
it's really whatever
you're comfortable with.

1077
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:59,760
I read them on the shitter.

1078
01:06:01,800 --> 01:06:03,560
Excuse me?

1079
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,320
Well, I was on the shitter,

1080
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:08,200
taking a shit when
I read your scripts,

1081
01:06:08,280 --> 01:06:10,360
so I Just thought
it was appropriate.

1082
01:06:12,360 --> 01:06:13,360
Jack!

1083
01:06:13,440 --> 01:06:15,440
He is so silly.
Stop it.

1084
01:06:15,520 --> 01:06:18,160
- He's kidding.
- That's Jack humor.

1085
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:20,800
Let's cut the shit, Barbi. Okay?

1086
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,080
We want the Journal
and we want you to kill the story.

1087
01:06:23,160 --> 01:06:24,160
What do you want?

1088
01:06:25,520 --> 01:06:29,400
You mean you don't want
to sign me as a client?

1089
01:06:29,480 --> 01:06:31,840
No, of course we do.
Jack, come on.

1090
01:06:31,880 --> 01:06:32,840
Oh, for God's sake.

1091
01:06:32,920 --> 01:06:34,640
She knows we don't want
to sign her as a client.

1092
01:06:34,720 --> 01:06:36,240
Barbi, have you ever
been to the Laker game?

1093
01:06:36,320 --> 01:06:38,760
Have you ever
sat on the floor at the Laker game?

1094
01:06:40,520 --> 01:06:42,400
You have no interest
in my work, do you?

1095
01:06:42,440 --> 01:06:44,160
Well, it is tiresome.

1096
01:07:06,280 --> 01:07:08,920
You're all so pathetic.

1097
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:10,600
Especially you, Jack.

1098
01:07:11,720 --> 01:07:14,480
I have you people by the short hairs
and you know it,

1099
01:07:14,560 --> 01:07:18,600
and you have no shot in hell
that I'm gonna kill this story.

1100
01:07:23,560 --> 01:07:26,840
Get your asses back
to your side of L.A.!

1101
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:32,320
Well, that went well.

1102
01:08:02,240 --> 01:08:03,880
Come on, Dad.

1103
01:08:05,600 --> 01:08:08,040
Dad, what are you
doing in there?

1104
01:08:08,120 --> 01:08:13,120
I looked these fish
right in the eye,

1105
01:08:13,160 --> 01:08:16,720
and they looked back at me,

1106
01:08:16,800 --> 01:08:21,320
and they...
they see right through me!

1107
01:08:21,400 --> 01:08:24,960
They know who I am,
these fish.

1108
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:27,920
Okay. Come on, Pop.
Let's get out. All right?

1109
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:32,160
I treated your mother like garbage.

1110
01:08:32,200 --> 01:08:34,200
Yeah.

1111
01:08:34,280 --> 01:08:37,360
I should have been Just...

1112
01:08:39,200 --> 01:08:41,480
...nice.

1113
01:08:41,560 --> 01:08:48,800
But then, I was very hard
to live with back then.

1114
01:08:51,760 --> 01:08:54,200
Okay, Dad.
Come on, get out.

1115
01:08:57,760 --> 01:09:00,640
Okay. Come on, let's go to bed.

1116
01:09:08,960 --> 01:09:11,560
I don't look back on the
good times I had with Nina

1117
01:09:11,600 --> 01:09:13,640
as Nina and I.

1118
01:09:13,720 --> 01:09:15,880
I know we had them.
We had many.

1119
01:09:16,840 --> 01:09:19,120
But I remember them now
as if we were someone else,

1120
01:09:19,200 --> 01:09:23,000
characters in a book or a film
or a game of some kind.

1121
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,200
Isn't this great?

1122
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:36,240
Yeah, but Just wait!

1123
01:09:36,320 --> 01:09:37,280
A couple years up the road,

1124
01:09:37,360 --> 01:09:38,880
I'm gonna start screwing
all your clients.

1125
01:09:38,960 --> 01:09:40,680
Then you'll know great!

1126
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:49,080
I don't have a clear memory
of when Nina and I were in love.

1127
01:09:51,920 --> 01:09:54,320
Babe, I told you, I don't
believe in therapists.

1128
01:09:54,400 --> 01:09:56,560
I've been there.
They're weasels.

1129
01:09:56,640 --> 01:09:58,320
They charge you an arm and a leg.

1130
01:09:58,400 --> 01:10:00,040
You know,
you spill your guts to them.

1131
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,480
You tell them every little deep,
dark secret you have,

1132
01:10:02,520 --> 01:10:05,200
and then you spend your whole life
praying to God

1133
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:06,960
you never run into 'em in public.

1134
01:10:07,040 --> 01:10:08,160
No.

1135
01:10:14,000 --> 01:10:16,520
If you screw my client
out of this picture,

1136
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:17,680
I will ruin you.

1137
01:10:17,760 --> 01:10:21,960
I will smear this town
with your severed testicles. Okay?

1138
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:22,960
You are nothing.

1139
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,600
Do not cross me on this. Okay?

1140
01:10:25,680 --> 01:10:27,680
I'm hanging up now.

1141
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:31,520
Because your response to my side
of the conversation is irrelevant.

1142
01:10:41,280 --> 01:10:42,520
Who was that?

1143
01:10:43,600 --> 01:10:45,080
Just a friend.

1144
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:46,960
I gotta go. I'm late.

1145
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,640
Dooley. Pack your shit.

1146
01:11:29,720 --> 01:11:30,960
You're fired.

1147
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:32,000
Excuse me?

1148
01:11:33,440 --> 01:11:34,880
You want his Job?

1149
01:11:34,960 --> 01:11:37,120
Yeah, sure.

1150
01:11:37,200 --> 01:11:38,040
All right, Dooley!

1151
01:11:38,120 --> 01:11:40,200
You're sitting at
the man's desk! Get up!

1152
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:43,360
Get up, get up, get up
and get the fuck out!

1153
01:11:56,800 --> 01:11:58,840
All right, Jack.

1154
01:11:58,920 --> 01:12:00,040
Before you go in there,

1155
01:12:00,120 --> 01:12:01,360
there's someone in your office.

1156
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:02,880
I set this up,
so if you want to be upset,

1157
01:12:02,960 --> 01:12:03,960
be upset with me,

1158
01:12:04,040 --> 01:12:06,080
but the two of you
need to talk face to face.

1159
01:12:06,160 --> 01:12:07,600
You're a piece of work,
Morty, you know that?

1160
01:12:07,640 --> 01:12:09,280
- Jack.
- Is it all about business with you?

1161
01:12:09,360 --> 01:12:12,720
Is that the only thing that matters
after all these years?

1162
01:12:13,560 --> 01:12:14,840
I mean, can't you see
how lost I am right now?

1163
01:12:14,920 --> 01:12:16,360
Just trust me, Jack.

1164
01:12:16,440 --> 01:12:18,840
The two of you need to talk.

1165
01:12:18,920 --> 01:12:20,840
Fine. I'll talk to him.

1166
01:12:20,920 --> 01:12:22,480
Good.

1167
01:12:42,680 --> 01:12:44,560
Morty told me about
the woman in Chinatown...

1168
01:12:46,680 --> 01:12:48,240
and about the Journal.

1169
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:50,760
I've seen you writing in it.

1170
01:12:56,440 --> 01:13:01,080
If you really loved me,
no matter what I did,

1171
01:13:01,160 --> 01:13:02,840
no matter what
we were going through,

1172
01:13:02,880 --> 01:13:05,040
you would not have
done what you did.

1173
01:13:07,960 --> 01:13:09,440
Okay, you're right.

1174
01:13:09,520 --> 01:13:13,360
I'm human. I'm flawed.

1175
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,640
I'm a flawed piece of shit, Jack.

1176
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:17,880
Is that what you want to hear?

1177
01:13:17,960 --> 01:13:20,040
Do you want to hear me beg?

1178
01:13:20,120 --> 01:13:22,600
'Cause I will. I'll beg.

1179
01:13:22,680 --> 01:13:24,640
It's not in my nature, but I'll do it.
I'll beg.

1180
01:13:39,640 --> 01:13:40,920
I'm asking for forgiveness.

1181
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:47,080
I'm asking you to somehow...

1182
01:13:47,160 --> 01:13:50,600
Iook inside yourself and...

1183
01:13:50,680 --> 01:13:52,640
find the place that
will allow you to focus

1184
01:13:52,720 --> 01:13:56,040
on all the incredible good
that's happened between us.

1185
01:13:57,880 --> 01:14:00,600
If you really love me,

1186
01:14:00,640 --> 01:14:02,680
then why is that
so goddamn hard?

1187
01:14:11,000 --> 01:14:12,120
Get out.

1188
01:14:28,600 --> 01:14:30,120
You okay?

1189
01:14:30,200 --> 01:14:31,400
Yeah, I'm fine.

1190
01:14:31,480 --> 01:14:32,840
All right, well,
put your game face on.

1191
01:14:32,920 --> 01:14:35,840
David Lilly and his wife
are on their way up.

1192
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:44,680
I'm going up.

1193
01:14:44,760 --> 01:14:46,600
No. Let's be smarter than this.

1194
01:14:46,680 --> 01:14:48,080
I want to get more on him.

1195
01:14:48,160 --> 01:14:50,680
He's in pain, this one.

1196
01:14:52,440 --> 01:14:55,040
The more I read this thing,
the more I see that.

1197
01:14:55,080 --> 01:14:56,520
He's gonna do
something stupid,

1198
01:14:56,560 --> 01:14:58,520
and I want to be there
when he does.

1199
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:05,280
I'm gonna have him in pain for you.

1200
01:15:06,280 --> 01:15:07,240
Baby...

1201
01:15:07,320 --> 01:15:09,280
Sorry. Please.

1202
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,680
Hold on.
Hide yourself.

1203
01:15:12,760 --> 01:15:14,480
Please hide.

1204
01:15:14,560 --> 01:15:16,160
This sucks.

1205
01:15:18,680 --> 01:15:22,400
Nina! Nina Giamoro!

1206
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:25,440
Hello.
My name is Barbi Ling.

1207
01:15:25,520 --> 01:15:26,920
I'm doing an article
on your husband.

1208
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:29,160
I was wondering if I could
have ten minutes with you

1209
01:15:29,240 --> 01:15:30,920
for some background stuff.

1210
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:33,920
Do you think we could go somewhere
and get a cup of coffee?

1211
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,680
Does my husband know
about this article?

1212
01:15:36,720 --> 01:15:38,600
Yeah, he does.
He knows.

1213
01:15:40,240 --> 01:15:42,040
Okay, sure.
Yeah, I'll give you your ten minutes.

1214
01:15:42,120 --> 01:15:43,840
Why don't we go upstairs
to the conference room?

1215
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:48,160
- Upstairs? No. L...
- I'll tell you what.

1216
01:15:48,200 --> 01:15:51,520
I'll give you twenty minutes
of some very good stuff.

1217
01:15:51,560 --> 01:15:53,320
My husband is
a priggish asshole.

1218
01:15:53,400 --> 01:15:55,200
Really?

1219
01:15:55,240 --> 01:15:57,920
Yeah. Don't be fooled
by the public face.

1220
01:15:57,960 --> 01:16:01,280
There's a whole different
story behind the gate.

1221
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:05,800
Come on.

1222
01:16:12,160 --> 01:16:13,120
Are you coming?

1223
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:15,720
Yeah, I'm coming.

1224
01:16:24,600 --> 01:16:27,240
Hello, Mr. Lilly.
I'm Lucky, Jack's assistant.

1225
01:16:27,320 --> 01:16:28,440
Jack is extremely excited...

1226
01:16:28,520 --> 01:16:29,640
David Lilly!

1227
01:16:29,720 --> 01:16:32,480
David Lilly,
how are you doing?

1228
01:16:32,560 --> 01:16:34,840
I'm glad you came, man.
I'm glad you came.

1229
01:16:34,920 --> 01:16:36,160
You remember my wife Brynn?

1230
01:16:36,240 --> 01:16:37,560
Of course, of course.

1231
01:16:37,640 --> 01:16:40,000
For the gate repair.
$6,000.

1232
01:16:45,800 --> 01:16:47,400
That's very funny.

1233
01:16:47,480 --> 01:16:49,360
- Just kidding!
- You got me!

1234
01:16:49,400 --> 01:16:50,360
No, I insist.
I insist.

1235
01:16:50,440 --> 01:16:52,160
Did you see his face?

1236
01:16:52,240 --> 01:16:53,600
Let's head back
to the office.

1237
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:54,880
We'll sit down,
we'll get comfortable.

1238
01:16:54,960 --> 01:16:56,760
Okay? Come on.

1239
01:17:13,520 --> 01:17:14,520
Oh, Nina!

1240
01:17:14,600 --> 01:17:16,400
Lucky! Lucky,
this is Barbi Ling.

1241
01:17:16,440 --> 01:17:18,320
She's writing a story on Jack.
Jack knows about it.

1242
01:17:18,360 --> 01:17:20,200
- Nice to meet you.
- Lucky?

1243
01:17:20,240 --> 01:17:21,600
Conference room?

1244
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:23,400
Yeah, yeah.
That way. Ling?

1245
01:17:23,440 --> 01:17:24,640
Yeah, Lucky.

1246
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:26,960
I see you.

1247
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:29,000
Morty, you're on speakerphone,

1248
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:30,760
and I'm here with Brynn Lilly.

1249
01:17:30,800 --> 01:17:33,320
That's great.
I'll be right over.

1250
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,720
Jack, today
is your lucky day.

1251
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:38,960
Brynn, or Lady Lilly,
as I refer to her,

1252
01:17:39,000 --> 01:17:41,480
is going to perform
a little audition for you.

1253
01:17:41,520 --> 01:17:43,440
Oh, that's not necessary.
We're gonna to handle her.

1254
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,800
We've already decided on that.
We're gonna do a great Job.

1255
01:17:45,840 --> 01:17:47,680
We have some career goals mapped out
that we want to talk about.

1256
01:17:47,760 --> 01:17:48,680
Morty's gonna come in.

1257
01:17:48,760 --> 01:17:51,080
I don't want any favors,
okay, Jack?

1258
01:17:51,160 --> 01:17:53,640
I really want you to handle me.

1259
01:17:53,720 --> 01:17:56,200
That's why I'm gonna do a scene,
and then, you know,

1260
01:17:56,280 --> 01:17:57,760
you and Morty can decide.

1261
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,760
If... if it'll make you...

1262
01:17:59,840 --> 01:18:01,320
if that's what you want, it's fine.

1263
01:18:01,400 --> 01:18:04,440
Great. It'll be fun.

1264
01:18:04,520 --> 01:18:06,320
Hello.

1265
01:18:06,360 --> 01:18:09,360
Morty, Brynn is gonna do a scene,
an audition scene.

1266
01:18:09,400 --> 01:18:11,200
A scene. Here?

1267
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:12,720
- Yeah.
- That's right.

1268
01:18:12,800 --> 01:18:15,760
Okay.
Hey, sounds great. Good.

1269
01:18:15,840 --> 01:18:17,600
David and I, with Jack's help,

1270
01:18:17,680 --> 01:18:20,520
are going to do
the Michael Douglas/Sharon Stone

1271
01:18:20,600 --> 01:18:22,880
<i>interrogation scene from Basic Instinct.</i>

1272
01:18:24,120 --> 01:18:25,600
Okay.

1273
01:18:25,680 --> 01:18:26,600
Great.

1274
01:18:26,680 --> 01:18:30,360
And no, I am not
wearing any underwear.

1275
01:18:37,720 --> 01:18:39,360
Seriously, you're so sweet.
Look at all this.

1276
01:18:39,440 --> 01:18:40,720
You're like a little angel face.

1277
01:18:40,760 --> 01:18:42,520
And you're the best secretary.

1278
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,000
Hi, Arlene.

1279
01:18:45,080 --> 01:18:46,080
Nina.

1280
01:18:46,160 --> 01:18:47,120
This is Barbi Ling.

1281
01:18:47,160 --> 01:18:49,200
She's writing a story
on Jack and the agency.

1282
01:18:49,240 --> 01:18:51,400
We Just wanted to use
the conference room

1283
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:52,560
for a few minutes,
maybe 20 minutes?

1284
01:18:52,600 --> 01:18:53,600
Yeah.

1285
01:18:53,680 --> 01:18:54,720
Actually, would you like
Arlene to sit in?

1286
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:56,640
I mean, no one knows
more about Jack

1287
01:18:56,720 --> 01:18:57,880
and the agency than Arlene.

1288
01:18:57,960 --> 01:18:59,360
Except for Jack.

1289
01:18:59,440 --> 01:19:00,880
I don't think so.

1290
01:19:00,920 --> 01:19:02,800
Okay. Arlene,
do you mind leaving?

1291
01:19:02,840 --> 01:19:04,720
No, not at all.

1292
01:19:12,120 --> 01:19:16,160
So, Miss Tramell
has waived her right to an attorney.

1293
01:19:16,240 --> 01:19:17,680
Did I miss something?

1294
01:19:19,800 --> 01:19:22,960
I told them you wouldn't want
an attorney present.

1295
01:19:23,000 --> 01:19:25,120
Why'd you waive your
right to an attorney, Miss Tramell?

1296
01:19:25,200 --> 01:19:26,920
Why did you think
I wouldn't want one?

1297
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:31,240
Sorry.
I told them you wouldn't wanna hide.

1298
01:19:31,320 --> 01:19:33,200
I have nothing to hide.

1299
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:40,880
There's no smoking
in this building, Miss Tramell.

1300
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:42,640
What are you gonna do?

1301
01:19:42,720 --> 01:19:44,320
Charge me with smoking?

1302
01:19:44,400 --> 01:19:46,960
- I need you.
- Not right now, you don't.

1303
01:19:47,040 --> 01:19:49,600
Would you tell us the nature
of your relationship with Mr. Boz?

1304
01:19:49,680 --> 01:19:50,960
Trust me on this.
Just trust me.

1305
01:19:51,040 --> 01:19:52,160
I had sex with him for
about a year and a half.

1306
01:19:52,240 --> 01:19:53,200
Arlene, this is important. Leave.

1307
01:19:53,280 --> 01:19:54,960
- I liked having sex with him.
- Jack.

1308
01:19:55,040 --> 01:19:57,320
He wasn't afraid
of experimenting.

1309
01:19:57,400 --> 01:20:00,720
I like men like that.

1310
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:04,480
I like men
who give me pleasure.

1311
01:20:04,560 --> 01:20:07,600
And he gave me a lot
of pleasure, Jack.

1312
01:20:10,280 --> 01:20:12,520
So Nina, let's start
with the big question.

1313
01:20:12,600 --> 01:20:14,840
Okay
That sounds good.

1314
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:20,120
What's the name
of the bigshot client of your husband's

1315
01:20:20,200 --> 01:20:22,080
that you've been sleeping with?

1316
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:44,640
Hi. Phil Balow to see
Jack Giamoro.

1317
01:20:44,680 --> 01:20:47,240
Sure, Mr. Balow.
Can you please have a seat?

1318
01:21:05,920 --> 01:21:08,000
You describe a white silk
scarf in your book.

1319
01:21:08,080 --> 01:21:10,280
I've always had a fondness
for white silk scarves.

1320
01:21:10,360 --> 01:21:12,560
But you said you liked men
to use their hands.

1321
01:21:12,640 --> 01:21:15,480
No. I said I like
Johnny to use his hands.

1322
01:21:17,440 --> 01:21:19,800
I don't give any rules, Jack.

1323
01:21:26,080 --> 01:21:28,560
- I go with the flow.
- I go with the flow.

1324
01:21:30,880 --> 01:21:33,200
Ever do drugs with Mr. Boz, Miss Tramell?

1325
01:21:33,280 --> 01:21:34,800
Sorry. Yes?

1326
01:21:34,880 --> 01:21:37,360
- Sure.
- Jack, it's me.

1327
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:38,560
- I'm trapped.
- You're trapped?

1328
01:21:38,640 --> 01:21:39,480
I am.

1329
01:21:39,560 --> 01:21:41,160
- What kind of drugs?
- I'm stuck.

1330
01:21:41,240 --> 01:21:42,920
- Cocaine.
- I'm stuck, too, Nina, okay?

1331
01:21:43,000 --> 01:21:43,880
We're all stuck,

1332
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:45,520
and let me Just say being
stuck is not an excuse

1333
01:21:45,600 --> 01:21:46,720
for what happened
with you and Phil.

1334
01:21:46,760 --> 01:21:48,400
Have you ever had
sex on cocaine, Jack?

1335
01:21:48,480 --> 01:21:51,360
- No, Jack, I'm trapped.
- It's nice.

1336
01:21:51,400 --> 01:21:52,560
- I'm trapped in a closet.

1337
01:21:52,640 --> 01:21:54,920
Honey, I'm trapped in a closet, too,
you know?

1338
01:21:54,960 --> 01:21:56,120
Okay?
Whatever the hell that means.

1339
01:21:56,200 --> 01:21:57,760
How did you feel
when I told you

1340
01:21:57,840 --> 01:21:59,720
Johnny Boz had died
that day at the beach?

1341
01:21:59,800 --> 01:22:00,960
Who the hell is Johnny Boz?

1342
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:03,440
I felt like somebody had read my book
and was playing a game.

1343
01:22:03,520 --> 01:22:05,600
Look, I'm in the
conference room closet

1344
01:22:05,640 --> 01:22:07,120
down the hall, Jack,
and I have your Journal,

1345
01:22:07,200 --> 01:22:08,640
and Barbi Ling
is outside the door.

1346
01:22:08,720 --> 01:22:09,640
But it didn't hurt...

1347
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:11,360
...even though
you were screwing him.

1348
01:22:12,760 --> 01:22:14,280
You still get pleasure.

1349
01:22:14,360 --> 01:22:16,320
Haven't you ever had sex
with anybody else

1350
01:22:16,400 --> 01:22:18,600
while you were married, Jack?

1351
01:22:26,280 --> 01:22:28,320
Okay, that's plenty.
I've seen enough.

1352
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,760
My God, what a talent.

1353
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,440
My God, what a talent.

1354
01:22:30,480 --> 01:22:31,440
I'll be right there.

1355
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:32,360
Morty?

1356
01:22:32,400 --> 01:22:33,720
Yeah, yeah. She's amazing.

1357
01:22:33,800 --> 01:22:34,880
You know who she reminds me of?

1358
01:22:34,960 --> 01:22:37,160
Me too. Good.
I'll be right back.

1359
01:22:38,840 --> 01:22:40,040
- Phil!
- Phil?

1360
01:22:40,080 --> 01:22:42,000
Yeah, Jack, it's Phil.

1361
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:45,680
The evil Phil, who you refuse
to give two seconds of your time to.

1362
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:47,760
- We gotta talk.
- Okay. One second.

1363
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,240
David, I'll be right back.

1364
01:22:49,320 --> 01:22:50,840
You were terrific.
Okay.

1365
01:22:50,920 --> 01:22:53,280
I'll be right back, Phil.
Then we're gonna talk. Okay?

1366
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:55,400
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

1367
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:56,360
Get me out of here, though.

1368
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:58,440
No. No, not "okay."

1369
01:22:58,480 --> 01:23:01,160
All right?
I have something to say to you, man.

1370
01:23:01,200 --> 01:23:02,720
Oh. Shit!

1371
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:04,240
I got your Journal back, Jack.

1372
01:23:04,320 --> 01:23:06,480
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1373
01:23:06,560 --> 01:23:09,840
Look man, I'm so in the wrong here.

1374
01:23:09,920 --> 01:23:11,240
I mean, I am so in the wrong.

1375
01:23:11,280 --> 01:23:14,000
I'm not gonna read it, Jack,
if that's what you're worried about.

1376
01:23:14,080 --> 01:23:16,080
- I'm not worried.
- All right. Well, good.

1377
01:23:16,160 --> 01:23:19,040
You know, I mean,
I'm glad you're not worried.

1378
01:23:19,120 --> 01:23:21,280
But you hate me.
I mean, is that it?

1379
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:24,360
I mean, you Just hate me
and you can't forgive me.

1380
01:23:24,440 --> 01:23:27,080
Why did you take this class,
though, Jack? I'm Just curious.

1381
01:23:27,160 --> 01:23:31,400
You've always been so resistant
to therapy or introspection,

1382
01:23:31,440 --> 01:23:33,040
and then out of the blue
you take this course.

1383
01:23:33,120 --> 01:23:34,080
Why?

1384
01:23:34,160 --> 01:23:36,040
- Answer me.
- Answer me.

1385
01:23:36,080 --> 01:23:37,360
I don't know.

1386
01:23:37,440 --> 01:23:38,600
I Just got to this place in my life

1387
01:23:38,680 --> 01:23:42,920
where I felt like
I don't know who I am.

1388
01:23:42,960 --> 01:23:47,400
I felt like, I don't know who I am...

1389
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:49,840
and I don't know how
to be in a marriage.

1390
01:23:51,720 --> 01:23:54,160
And that scared me.

1391
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:57,160
Going crazy on me, Jack?

1392
01:23:58,400 --> 01:24:01,840
No, Phil. I'm not going
crazy on you, Phil.

1393
01:24:01,920 --> 01:24:03,640
It's Just that, uh...

1394
01:24:06,800 --> 01:24:08,880
I'm imperfect, you know?

1395
01:24:08,960 --> 01:24:11,400
I am. We all are.

1396
01:24:11,480 --> 01:24:16,000
I mean, we're all
so damn imperfect.

1397
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:17,800
I know, baby.

1398
01:24:17,880 --> 01:24:20,240
I know, baby.

1399
01:24:20,280 --> 01:24:22,720
Imperfect, I'll cop to.

1400
01:24:22,800 --> 01:24:23,760
Give me a hug.

1401
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:27,160
Not you, Phil.

1402
01:24:27,240 --> 01:24:28,560
Oh, no, I am.

1403
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:30,440
After all that preparation,
he Just leaves us?

1404
01:24:30,520 --> 01:24:32,480
- You know, I spent hours.
- I know, I know.

1405
01:24:32,560 --> 01:24:33,520
I made this outfit.

1406
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:35,280
- He's coming back.
- Whatever.

1407
01:24:35,360 --> 01:24:36,880
All right, get off.

1408
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:38,400
Come on. That's enough.

1409
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:47,880
It's locked.

1410
01:24:47,960 --> 01:24:50,080
Yes. I see that.

1411
01:25:03,640 --> 01:25:04,560
Jack, the police are on their way.

1412
01:25:04,640 --> 01:25:05,480
You better get out here now.

1413
01:25:05,560 --> 01:25:06,600
You won't believe
what's going on out here.

1414
01:25:06,680 --> 01:25:09,240
Hello.

1415
01:25:09,320 --> 01:25:10,360
You coming?

1416
01:25:10,440 --> 01:25:11,840
Jack, you gotta get out here now.

1417
01:25:11,920 --> 01:25:12,880
All right, all right,
all right.

1418
01:25:21,240 --> 01:25:22,440
I'll be right back.

1419
01:25:22,520 --> 01:25:25,280
You bigshot piece of shit!

1420
01:25:26,600 --> 01:25:29,200
This make a good script for you?

1421
01:25:29,240 --> 01:25:30,160
I know the ending!

1422
01:25:30,200 --> 01:25:32,840
Barbi, go in there
and tell him this is over,

1423
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:34,440
'cause the cops
are about to get here,

1424
01:25:34,520 --> 01:25:36,520
and when they do,
I'm gonna tell them everything...

1425
01:25:36,600 --> 01:25:38,520
burglary, assault,
extortion.

1426
01:25:38,600 --> 01:25:41,960
I mean, you'll go to Jail for ten years,
with an expensive lawyer.

1427
01:25:42,040 --> 01:25:43,800
So tell me, is this over?

1428
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:46,960
Correct answer is yes.

1429
01:25:48,640 --> 01:25:49,920
Yes, it's over.

1430
01:25:50,000 --> 01:25:52,120
Okay.

1431
01:25:52,160 --> 01:25:54,320
Go tell this idiot,
before he burns the office down.

1432
01:25:56,000 --> 01:25:57,160
I could've been sitting here!

1433
01:25:57,240 --> 01:25:58,520
No, Jimmy, no!

1434
01:25:58,560 --> 01:25:59,880
- No!
- No, let's go, let's go!

1435
01:25:59,960 --> 01:26:02,360
- We have to burn down his office!
- No! No!

1436
01:26:02,440 --> 01:26:03,440
One problem, dickhead.

1437
01:26:03,520 --> 01:26:07,040
It's not his office,
it's my office, okay?

1438
01:26:57,520 --> 01:26:59,720
You stalking me?

1439
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:03,040
I am.

1440
01:27:05,240 --> 01:27:07,840
I wanna come home, Jack.

1441
01:27:07,920 --> 01:27:10,800
I wanna come home so bad.

1442
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:15,600
I Just...

1443
01:27:16,960 --> 01:27:19,280
I Just wanna come home.

1444
01:27:19,360 --> 01:27:24,920
I want us to get it right
and I wanna come home.

1445
01:27:30,600 --> 01:27:31,800
Come here.

1446
01:28:18,280 --> 01:28:19,680
I have made a decision.

1447
01:28:19,720 --> 01:28:22,280
I no longer choose to
be a talent agent.

1448
01:28:22,360 --> 01:28:24,520
I have left my company.

1449
01:28:24,600 --> 01:28:26,640
My former partners all have voted.

1450
01:28:26,720 --> 01:28:29,760
Arlene will replace me
and run the company.

1451
01:28:29,800 --> 01:28:33,120
Needless to say,
this did not sit well with Morty.

1452
01:28:34,720 --> 01:28:37,120
For the first time in fifteen years,

1453
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:39,960
I will be Just Jack,

1454
01:28:40,040 --> 01:28:43,200
Something I have grown and built
and guided and nourished

1455
01:28:43,240 --> 01:28:48,160
with every beat of life that I had
is no longer mine.

1456
01:28:48,200 --> 01:28:52,040
I am nothing without the elixir
of constant movement.

1457
01:28:52,120 --> 01:28:55,440
I do not know how to Just be still.

1458
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:17,680
So I shall read these,

1459
01:29:17,760 --> 01:29:19,320
and within two weeks,

1460
01:29:19,400 --> 01:29:22,920
you'll be receiving
a grade and an evaluation.

1461
01:29:22,960 --> 01:29:24,480
Thank you. Thank you.

1462
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:26,600
I have no problem
with you reading this,

1463
01:29:26,680 --> 01:29:28,080
you and you alone,

1464
01:29:28,160 --> 01:29:29,760
if that's what it takes
to finish the course.

1465
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:30,720
Wonderful.

1466
01:29:30,800 --> 01:29:32,520
I do not need
an evaluation, however.

1467
01:29:32,600 --> 01:29:35,240
Give me any grade you want.
I'm done.

1468
01:29:35,320 --> 01:29:37,000
I gotta tell you something.

1469
01:29:37,080 --> 01:29:39,600
You're a real shitbag, Primkin.

1470
01:29:45,400 --> 01:29:46,360
All in all, though,

1471
01:29:46,440 --> 01:29:47,560
I think you taught
a pretty good class.

1472
01:29:47,640 --> 01:29:48,840
Thank you.

1473
01:29:50,000 --> 01:29:52,240
So, you're done.
Is that it?

1474
01:29:52,280 --> 01:29:54,360
That's it. I'm done.

1475
01:29:54,440 --> 01:29:56,600
Good. You've done well, son.

1476
01:29:56,680 --> 01:29:58,760
You done good.

1477
01:29:58,840 --> 01:29:59,880
Except...

1478
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,720
you spelled "Primkin" wrong.

1479
01:30:06,800 --> 01:30:08,520
God.

1480
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:14,520
Nina and I
have a long way to go.

1481
01:30:14,600 --> 01:30:15,960
With the odds against us,

1482
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:17,880
we are determined
to make it work.

1483
01:30:19,240 --> 01:30:21,320
There's things I'll need to forget.

1484
01:30:23,080 --> 01:30:25,320
There's things she'll need
to make sure I remember.

1485
01:30:29,960 --> 01:30:34,440
How is it possible that I
still have so much to learn?

1486
01:30:36,360 --> 01:30:37,400
End of entry.
