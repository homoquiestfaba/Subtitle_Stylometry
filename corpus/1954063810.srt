1
00:00:47,452 --> 00:00:49,122
Six times three.

2
00:00:51,322 --> 00:00:52,893
Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.

3
00:00:54,292 --> 00:00:55,293
Hurry up.

4
00:00:56,629 --> 00:00:58,799
It's eighteen.
Ooh!

5
00:01:11,644 --> 00:01:12,980
Ring the bell three times,

6
00:01:13,045 --> 00:01:15,751
put your helmet on the ground.
You're done.

7
00:01:23,156 --> 00:01:25,093
Commence! You don't make it,
you do it again!

8
00:01:25,158 --> 00:01:26,861
You ever been tested this hard
ever in your life?

9
00:01:26,926 --> 00:01:27,961
Never.

10
00:01:30,164 --> 00:01:32,835
Winning here is
a conscious decision.

11
00:01:35,102 --> 00:01:37,272
Make up your mind if
you want to pass

12
00:01:39,006 --> 00:01:40,843
or choose to fail.

13
00:01:41,876 --> 00:01:43,713
All right now, gentlemen,
I'm gonna introduce y'all

14
00:01:43,777 --> 00:01:46,617
to something called
"not being able to breathe. "

15
00:01:50,017 --> 00:01:52,155
Andrew!
Come back.

16
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:53,722
Come back to the light.

17
00:01:59,127 --> 00:02:01,397
All this shaking and all
this cold. Harness it.

18
00:02:01,462 --> 00:02:02,698
Turn it into aggression.

19
00:02:14,209 --> 00:02:16,914
You just proved to your bodies,
through your mind,

20
00:02:18,247 --> 00:02:21,019
that you can push yourself further
than you thought possible.

21
00:02:32,061 --> 00:02:33,397
Go get wet! Run!

22
00:02:35,565 --> 00:02:37,168
I'm at my limit, so...

23
00:02:38,068 --> 00:02:39,403
...that's it.

24
00:02:43,073 --> 00:02:44,943
You sure you want to be here?
Yes, I do.

25
00:02:45,008 --> 00:02:46,243
Are you absolutely sure?

26
00:02:46,309 --> 00:02:47,577
I'm positive!

27
00:02:56,587 --> 00:02:58,089
Whatever you have to do!

28
00:03:00,191 --> 00:03:01,860
Just find an excuse to win.

29
00:03:04,028 --> 00:03:05,363
Keep going.

30
00:03:07,198 --> 00:03:08,968
It pays to be a winner!

31
00:03:15,773 --> 00:03:18,279
I like having my buddies
that I can depend on.

32
00:03:18,343 --> 00:03:20,580
And I would like for them
to be able to depend on me.

33
00:03:21,112 --> 00:03:22,849
These guys are our
band of brothers.

34
00:03:25,783 --> 00:03:29,124
# Silent night

35
00:03:29,788 --> 00:03:32,794
# Holy night

36
00:03:33,792 --> 00:03:36,798
# All is calm

37
00:03:37,796 --> 00:03:40,469
# All is bright

38
00:04:45,701 --> 00:04:47,871
There's a storm inside of us.

39
00:04:54,643 --> 00:04:57,315
I've heard many team
guys speak of this.

40
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:02,285
A burning.

41
00:05:06,956 --> 00:05:08,291
A river.

42
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,430
A drive.

43
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:22,473
An unrelenting
desire to push yourself

44
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:25,144
harder and further than
anyone could think possible.

45
00:05:32,517 --> 00:05:35,356
Pushing ourselves into those cold,
dark corners.

46
00:05:38,289 --> 00:05:40,292
Where the bad things live.

47
00:05:42,760 --> 00:05:44,764
Where the bad things fight.

48
00:05:48,867 --> 00:05:50,904
We wanted that Fight
at the highest volume.

49
00:05:58,177 --> 00:05:59,612
Aloud fight.

50
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:04,118
The loudest,
coldest, darkest,

51
00:06:04,183 --> 00:06:06,587
most unpleasant of
the unpleasant fights.

52
00:08:23,762 --> 00:08:25,297
Is this doable?

53
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:31,504
It's expensive.

54
00:08:32,605 --> 00:08:34,107
How much?

55
00:08:34,340 --> 00:08:38,181
It's an Arabian horse, man.
She got good taste.

56
00:08:38,944 --> 00:08:40,280
I know.

57
00:08:41,047 --> 00:08:42,048
How much?

58
00:08:43,082 --> 00:08:45,754
I'll find out. Expensive.

59
00:08:46,619 --> 00:08:47,655
You're fucked, man.

60
00:08:51,124 --> 00:08:52,460
I know.

61
00:09:10,077 --> 00:09:11,580
I'm up.

62
00:09:14,682 --> 00:09:15,850
Going down.

63
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:02,896
Murphy by 1.1.

64
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:05,933
More than that.
More than that, Marcus.

65
00:11:05,998 --> 00:11:08,001
Fuckin' dude, I was being generous.
Trust me.

66
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:09,536
Who won?

67
00:11:10,102 --> 00:11:12,674
Murph. Murph, barely.
By one second.

68
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:13,739
Barely.

69
00:11:14,340 --> 00:11:15,675
Barely.
Head shave?

70
00:11:15,741 --> 00:11:18,480
Head shave or what? I don't know, you know?
It's something to think about.

71
00:11:18,544 --> 00:11:20,614
If I shave his head,
I have to focus on his face.

72
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,585
Face, ears.
Oddly-shaped head.

73
00:11:24,284 --> 00:11:26,021
Well, I don't wanna be looking
at him that close, either,

74
00:11:26,086 --> 00:11:28,056
but he has been running his
mouth about beating you. Really?

75
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:29,990
Fuck, a head shave is fair.

76
00:11:30,557 --> 00:11:32,192
Axe?
Better shave him.

77
00:11:32,258 --> 00:11:36,099
Make him go eat with the E-3s, work
in the chow hall until it grows back.

78
00:11:36,163 --> 00:11:37,298
Frankie, what do you think?

79
00:11:37,364 --> 00:11:38,632
Why the fuck
wouldn't we shave him?

80
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:39,933
That's valid.

81
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:41,737
Patton, not that we care,
but what do you think?

82
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:44,474
Let me see you make a
tactical decision right now.

83
00:11:44,538 --> 00:11:46,608
Well, I could go both ways on this.

84
00:11:46,874 --> 00:11:48,276
He did lose, but he was close.

85
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:50,513
And you're Mike Murphy.

86
00:11:50,578 --> 00:11:52,080
You are Mike Murphy.

87
00:11:52,146 --> 00:11:53,248
The Mike Murphy.

88
00:11:53,314 --> 00:11:54,917
I would've expected
a bigger separation.

89
00:11:54,982 --> 00:11:57,253
That is a good point.
Backhanded compliment.

90
00:11:57,319 --> 00:11:59,222
Patton. Grab my razor.

91
00:11:59,287 --> 00:12:00,288
Razor, copy that.

92
00:12:01,489 --> 00:12:02,624
Listen up.

93
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:05,362
Red Wings' a go.
Tonight, 1800.

94
00:12:09,197 --> 00:12:10,232
Beautiful.

95
00:12:10,365 --> 00:12:11,400
Am I going?

96
00:12:11,466 --> 00:12:13,002
PLO in an hour.

97
00:12:16,872 --> 00:12:17,873
Maybe I'll go.

98
00:12:17,939 --> 00:12:21,247
It's a maybe. I'll give you
a maybe. Stay optimistic.

99
00:12:23,212 --> 00:12:24,581
Boys.
Hey, what's up?

100
00:12:25,281 --> 00:12:26,583
What the fuck
am I doing wrong?

101
00:12:28,217 --> 00:12:29,519
Oh, come on.

102
00:12:29,585 --> 00:12:31,455
I'll tell you what, Shane,
here's your first op.

103
00:12:32,221 --> 00:12:33,323
You ready?

104
00:12:34,591 --> 00:12:35,693
Clean all this up.

105
00:12:46,303 --> 00:12:49,776
The objective of this mission is
to capture and kill Ahmad Shah.

106
00:12:51,175 --> 00:12:53,379
Bad guy.
Senior Taliban commander

107
00:12:53,443 --> 00:12:56,482
responsible for killing
Marines in eastern Afghanistan.

108
00:12:56,547 --> 00:12:57,782
A Tier I target.

109
00:12:57,848 --> 00:13:02,189
If you want a positive I.D.,
note that Shah has no earlobes.

110
00:13:05,356 --> 00:13:06,925
Taraq.

111
00:13:06,990 --> 00:13:09,763
His right-hand man. Seems to do
most of his chief shit for him.

112
00:13:16,768 --> 00:13:18,972
We're going in with
a four-man recon team.

113
00:13:19,204 --> 00:13:22,043
Axelson, you'll be point.
Myself, I'll be second.

114
00:13:22,106 --> 00:13:24,779
Dietz, comms.
Marcus, rear, med.

115
00:13:25,477 --> 00:13:26,779
Axe, give us our route.

116
00:13:26,845 --> 00:13:29,150
We're gonna be moving up the
back side of this mountain here,

117
00:13:29,215 --> 00:13:31,686
which is gonna offer great
concealment from the village.

118
00:13:32,484 --> 00:13:34,654
I'm estimating that it's
gonna take us between

119
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:37,960
three and four hours, depending
upon the gradient of the terrain

120
00:13:38,023 --> 00:13:40,596
which is that crappy shale.

121
00:13:41,060 --> 00:13:42,663
So please lace up.

122
00:13:48,801 --> 00:13:51,173
First things first.
You're gonna win the fight.

123
00:13:52,105 --> 00:13:53,474
No medicine in a gun fight.

124
00:13:53,539 --> 00:13:56,012
Two weeks ago, Team 8 was near
where we're gonna be.

125
00:13:56,476 --> 00:13:57,744
Capelli got bit
by a rattlesnake.

126
00:13:58,011 --> 00:14:00,081
Contrary to popular belief,
there is poison oak,

127
00:14:00,146 --> 00:14:01,817
so watch your cock and balls,
'cause that will suck.

128
00:14:07,287 --> 00:14:08,857
Murph's got the satphone.

129
00:14:08,922 --> 00:14:12,529
The angle ofthis region is very
steep. Expect typical comms problems.

130
00:14:12,593 --> 00:14:14,697
We're gonna be on
two-hour comms windows.

131
00:14:14,762 --> 00:14:18,836
If we miss two windows, I'd say wake
somebody up. If not, don't sweat it.

132
00:14:19,133 --> 00:14:22,339
Waypoint one is Budweiser.
Waypoint two is Miller.

133
00:14:22,536 --> 00:14:24,439
Three is Corona.
Four is Heineken.

134
00:14:24,505 --> 00:14:26,743
And for our O.P. 1,
Schlitz Malt Liquor.

135
00:14:26,808 --> 00:14:29,813
And if and when we I.D.
Shah, pass Rick James.

136
00:14:38,653 --> 00:14:42,093
Gentlemen, these are your Rules of
Engagement. US forces will comply

137
00:14:42,157 --> 00:14:44,261
with the Law oF
Armed Conflict at all times.

138
00:14:44,326 --> 00:14:45,862
Use of deadly
force is authorized.

139
00:14:48,163 --> 00:14:49,431
Allahu Akbar!

140
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:51,601
If you do come under attack,

141
00:14:52,134 --> 00:14:55,941
use the appropriate force necessary
to deter or defeat that threat.

142
00:15:03,646 --> 00:15:08,555
Leaving here at 1800.
Two Chinooks and two Apaches.

143
00:15:08,752 --> 00:15:12,759
We fly here to the L.Z., insert
the four-man team right here.

144
00:15:13,289 --> 00:15:15,961
Then we fly 30
minutes to J-Bad.

145
00:15:16,993 --> 00:15:20,233
Here, we'll have
15 team guys

146
00:15:20,297 --> 00:15:22,501
and about a dozen
Marines standing by all night.

147
00:15:22,566 --> 00:15:26,740
When we hear "Schlitz Malt
Liquor", we're heading back

148
00:15:27,104 --> 00:15:29,107
to Bagram for phase two.

149
00:15:30,341 --> 00:15:33,180
The QRF will
stay here at J-Bad.

150
00:15:33,845 --> 00:15:36,182
Now the Apaches stay
with the Black Hawks.

151
00:15:36,448 --> 00:15:39,687
The movement is so we can get
the 47's back here

152
00:15:40,184 --> 00:15:43,190
ready to bring up to phrase
two, once you get eyes on Shah.

153
00:15:43,254 --> 00:15:44,490
Oh,

154
00:15:44,556 --> 00:15:48,297
I bringing up tomorrow night's
new guy presentation to 1400 today,

155
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:51,699
so that all may
revel and partake.

156
00:15:52,497 --> 00:15:54,000
You better be good, Napoleon.

157
00:15:54,132 --> 00:15:55,133
Fuck.

158
00:15:55,734 --> 00:15:58,071
A lot of moving parts.

159
00:16:08,747 --> 00:16:10,717
We were going to wait and
then she gets her head into it

160
00:16:10,782 --> 00:16:13,321
and when she gets her head
into something, that's it.

161
00:16:13,386 --> 00:16:16,125
There's no stopping her, man.
She's going all out.

162
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:18,092
You know, you should just let her do it.

163
00:16:18,357 --> 00:16:20,495
You got a handyman woman.
That's a good thing.

164
00:16:21,060 --> 00:16:23,398
He's afraid of losing
control over his castle.

165
00:16:23,597 --> 00:16:24,966
He's having control issues
'cause he's the one

166
00:16:25,031 --> 00:16:27,001
who's always made the taste
decisions in the family, right?

167
00:16:27,066 --> 00:16:30,239
No, she's got great taste.
I... I trust her.

168
00:16:30,303 --> 00:16:31,372
Well, what does she like?

169
00:16:32,872 --> 00:16:33,908
Rose Honeydew.

170
00:16:35,409 --> 00:16:36,979
Oh.
Is that a color?

171
00:16:37,044 --> 00:16:38,045
Mmm-mmm.

172
00:16:39,079 --> 00:16:40,414
You better control
that situation.

173
00:16:40,681 --> 00:16:42,050
It's very ongoing.

174
00:16:42,116 --> 00:16:44,220
New grass leads to
new bushes by the windows,

175
00:16:44,284 --> 00:16:46,689
leads to new curtains,
leads to new sofa,

176
00:16:46,754 --> 00:16:48,557
leads to new carpet,
leads to new floor.

177
00:16:48,623 --> 00:16:49,758
New baby.

178
00:16:49,823 --> 00:16:51,494
Dude, she's pregnant?
How far along is she?

179
00:16:51,559 --> 00:16:52,761
You know if it's
a boy or a girl?

180
00:16:52,826 --> 00:16:55,299
No, she's not pregnant.
She's just on a weird journey,

181
00:16:55,363 --> 00:16:57,835
moving through the house,
one room to the next.

182
00:16:57,899 --> 00:16:59,501
Sounds expensive.
Sounds pregnant.

183
00:16:59,567 --> 00:17:01,504
Congratulations.

184
00:17:11,146 --> 00:17:12,249
You're fuckin' late.

185
00:17:12,881 --> 00:17:13,949
Sir, I'm good to go.

186
00:17:14,015 --> 00:17:15,050
No.

187
00:17:15,584 --> 00:17:17,688
You should introduce yourself

188
00:17:17,752 --> 00:17:19,456
and tell us something about
you we don't know.

189
00:17:20,522 --> 00:17:21,624
All right. Petty Officer...

190
00:17:21,690 --> 00:17:22,959
Oh, shut up!

191
00:17:24,226 --> 00:17:25,294
Get out!

192
00:17:25,361 --> 00:17:26,797
Shut the fuck up!

193
00:17:26,963 --> 00:17:27,964
Hey. Settle down.

194
00:17:28,063 --> 00:17:30,234
Give the kid a chance. Remember
what it was like for you.

195
00:17:33,135 --> 00:17:35,005
Petty Officer...

196
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:36,507
Who gives a shit!

197
00:17:36,806 --> 00:17:38,309
Shut the fuck up!

198
00:17:39,575 --> 00:17:41,079
Mr. Patton, please.

199
00:18:00,331 --> 00:18:01,599
There we go.

200
00:18:04,502 --> 00:18:05,503
More neck.

201
00:18:06,905 --> 00:18:09,777
Come on, dude, you got to
get into it. Lose yourself.

202
00:18:09,841 --> 00:18:10,842
Yeah!

203
00:18:11,743 --> 00:18:12,744
Whoa!

204
00:18:13,845 --> 00:18:15,280
Whoo!

205
00:18:25,024 --> 00:18:26,226
Really, really bad.

206
00:18:26,425 --> 00:18:27,593
Dude, that was traumatizing.

207
00:18:27,659 --> 00:18:29,129
Can we vote to
push him through?

208
00:18:29,194 --> 00:18:30,262
Because I can't
see that ever again.

209
00:18:30,495 --> 00:18:32,733
Hands up.
Push him through!

210
00:18:32,798 --> 00:18:34,467
I don't know.
Can he say it?

211
00:18:34,534 --> 00:18:36,270
Can you say it?
Prove it!

212
00:18:36,334 --> 00:18:38,573
I don't want to watch you
dance again. I really don't.

213
00:18:38,637 --> 00:18:39,706
Can you say it, Mr. Patton?

214
00:18:39,772 --> 00:18:41,275
I can say it,
I can say it.

215
00:18:43,509 --> 00:18:45,011
Uh...
Don't fuck it up.

216
00:18:50,283 --> 00:18:52,821
Come on. No more
fucking around. Come on.

217
00:18:56,089 --> 00:18:59,094
Been around the world twice.
Talked to everyone once.

218
00:18:59,493 --> 00:19:01,830
Seen two whales fuck.
Been to three world fairs.

219
00:19:02,896 --> 00:19:05,334
I even know a man in Thailand
with a wooden cock.

220
00:19:05,566 --> 00:19:08,672
I push more peter more
sweeter and more completer

221
00:19:08,735 --> 00:19:10,538
than any other
peter pusher around.

222
00:19:12,907 --> 00:19:14,877
I'm a hard-bodied,
hairy-chested,

223
00:19:14,942 --> 00:19:17,246
rootin'- tootin'
shootin', parac' hutin'

224
00:19:17,311 --> 00:19:20,050
demolition double-cap
crimpin' frogman.

225
00:19:20,582 --> 00:19:21,784
There ain't nothing
I can't do.

226
00:19:21,849 --> 00:19:24,588
No sky too high, no sea too
rough, no muFF too tough.

227
00:19:25,920 --> 00:19:27,690
Learned a lot of
lessons in my life.

228
00:19:28,856 --> 00:19:32,029
Never shoot a large-caliber
man with a small-caliber bullet.

229
00:19:33,028 --> 00:19:34,865
Drive all kinds of trucks.

230
00:19:34,930 --> 00:19:37,134
Two-bys, four-bys, six-bys.

231
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:41,039
And those big motherfuckers
that bend and go, "sshh-sshh"

232
00:19:41,103 --> 00:19:42,773
when you
step on the brakes.

233
00:19:43,705 --> 00:19:47,145
Anything in life worth doing is worth
overdoing. Moderation is for cowards.

234
00:19:47,208 --> 00:19:51,217
I'm a lover, I'm a fighter,
I'm a UDT Navy SEAL diver.

235
00:19:51,614 --> 00:19:53,250
I'll wine, dine,
intertwine,

236
00:19:53,316 --> 00:19:55,586
and sneak out the back door
when the refueling is done.

237
00:19:56,285 --> 00:19:58,222
So if you're feeling froggy,
then you betterjump,

238
00:19:58,287 --> 00:20:01,559
because this frogman's been there,
done that and is going back for more.

239
00:20:01,624 --> 00:20:02,626
Cheers, boys.

240
00:20:17,307 --> 00:20:19,477
She does not need
an Arabian horse!

241
00:20:20,644 --> 00:20:21,980
How the fuck
do you know about that?

242
00:20:22,046 --> 00:20:24,083
I know everything, Murphy.

243
00:20:28,919 --> 00:20:31,858
More a Tennessee
Walker cross stallion.

244
00:20:32,323 --> 00:20:34,994
The original Silver.
The Lone Ranger's horse.

245
00:20:35,125 --> 00:20:36,394
No shit.

246
00:20:37,495 --> 00:20:40,834
Glorious horse, Murphy.
Glorious!

247
00:20:47,172 --> 00:20:51,681
Razor 11, 64 is two mikes out.
Establish overwatch at 1000 AGL.

248
00:20:59,351 --> 00:21:01,021
All right, Commander,
approaching the L.Z.

249
00:21:01,087 --> 00:21:02,155
One mike on the deck.

250
00:21:02,621 --> 00:21:03,856
One minute!

251
00:21:11,797 --> 00:21:12,900
Thirty seconds.

252
00:21:12,965 --> 00:21:13,966
Thirty seconds!

253
00:21:17,604 --> 00:21:20,943
Roger. Establish overwatch
at 5000 MSL.

254
00:21:21,006 --> 00:21:23,679
Bruno 64 will be a fast rope
infil. Stand by, Commander.

255
00:21:26,512 --> 00:21:28,083
Good hoyer.
Hold your hover.

256
00:21:28,882 --> 00:21:30,384
Rope's deployed.

257
00:21:30,984 --> 00:21:32,419
first team member on rope.

258
00:21:32,485 --> 00:21:33,588
Go!

259
00:21:40,060 --> 00:21:41,730
first man on the ground.

260
00:21:41,995 --> 00:21:43,331
Second man on the rope.

261
00:21:43,397 --> 00:21:44,966
Hey. Next one, Shane, okay?

262
00:21:45,299 --> 00:21:47,569
Have fun, you lucky bastard!

263
00:21:59,414 --> 00:22:03,087
lulu 06, Bruno 64
infil complete. RTB.

264
00:22:27,277 --> 00:22:30,783
Apollo 2-2, Spartan O-1.
Radio check.

265
00:22:32,615 --> 00:22:34,652
Spartan O-1,
this is Apollo 2-2.

266
00:22:34,717 --> 00:22:37,355
We'll be with you for the next
six hours. Have a nice walk.

267
00:22:37,821 --> 00:22:40,693
Apollo 2-2,
this is Spartan O-1. Copy.

268
00:22:40,890 --> 00:22:42,226
Comms check.
Check.

269
00:22:42,626 --> 00:22:43,661
Check.

270
00:22:43,960 --> 00:22:45,128
Check.

271
00:22:47,197 --> 00:22:49,936
Spartan O-1,
I passed Budweiser. How copy?

272
00:22:50,467 --> 00:22:53,840
Spartan O-1, Apollo 2-2.
Good copy. Budweiser.

273
00:23:07,485 --> 00:23:09,154
Apollo 2-2.

274
00:23:09,687 --> 00:23:12,526
Spartan O-1 hit Miller.

275
00:23:16,694 --> 00:23:18,531
Sir,
Spartan O-1 passes Miller.

276
00:23:18,997 --> 00:23:22,336
Spartan O-1, Spartan base.
I copy. Miller.

277
00:23:33,178 --> 00:23:35,783
Apollo 2-2, Spartan O-1.

278
00:23:36,515 --> 00:23:38,017
It's Corona.

279
00:23:38,284 --> 00:23:40,354
Looks like they're
doing pretty good, Chief.

280
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:52,367
Apollo 2... Spartan O-1.

281
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:53,767
It's Hein...

282
00:23:54,868 --> 00:23:56,304
Say again, your last?

283
00:23:56,536 --> 00:23:58,873
Spartan O-1.
Here's Heineken.

284
00:23:59,206 --> 00:24:00,341
How copy?

285
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:01,642
Good copy.

286
00:24:01,708 --> 00:24:03,311
Spartan O-1 passes Heineken.

287
00:25:09,245 --> 00:25:11,083
It's the final waypoint.
Call it in.

288
00:25:15,251 --> 00:25:18,959
Spartan Base, this is
Spartan O-1. Radio check.

289
00:25:20,090 --> 00:25:22,360
Spartan... Spartan O-1.

290
00:25:24,428 --> 00:25:28,134
Spartan O-1, this is Beastmaster.
Say again. You're weak and unreadable.

291
00:25:30,934 --> 00:25:32,437
Take a peek.

292
00:25:35,739 --> 00:25:36,875
Spartan Base.

293
00:25:36,941 --> 00:25:37,942
Shit.

294
00:25:38,542 --> 00:25:39,610
Can't see half the village.

295
00:25:40,111 --> 00:25:42,415
I passed Schlitz Malt Liquor.
I say again.

296
00:25:42,847 --> 00:25:44,517
I passed Schlitz Malt Liquor.

297
00:25:45,216 --> 00:25:46,251
Good copy.

298
00:25:46,451 --> 00:25:48,621
Sir, intermittent
comms with Spartan O-1,

299
00:25:48,687 --> 00:25:49,889
but they have arrived at the O.P.

300
00:25:52,957 --> 00:25:53,958
All right, fellas.

301
00:25:54,693 --> 00:25:57,165
Our boys are safe
and secure for the day.

302
00:25:57,229 --> 00:25:59,566
Team one,
back to Bagram with me.

303
00:26:00,298 --> 00:26:04,473
Team two, enjoy your time
here at J-Bad. Nighty-night.

304
00:26:07,973 --> 00:26:10,077
Spartan O-1, Apollo 2-2.

305
00:26:10,976 --> 00:26:12,879
Sun's up.
We're out. Good luck.

306
00:26:12,945 --> 00:26:14,013
A- firm.

307
00:26:22,088 --> 00:26:23,590
Find a new spot?

308
00:26:25,258 --> 00:26:26,426
Let's try to make that peak.

309
00:26:27,493 --> 00:26:29,330
See if that's not better.

310
00:26:29,996 --> 00:26:31,332
Sounds good.

311
00:26:47,114 --> 00:26:48,684
Boys all set?

312
00:26:49,016 --> 00:26:52,355
They're all set. They're in position.
All's good.

313
00:26:53,020 --> 00:26:55,124
Enioy your night.
Sleep well.

314
00:26:55,189 --> 00:26:56,325
Enjoy yours, brother.

315
00:26:56,391 --> 00:26:57,392
Thanks, Pete.

316
00:26:59,360 --> 00:27:01,364
Glorious day.
Eh, Patton?

317
00:27:01,629 --> 00:27:02,897
Yes, sir.

318
00:27:06,201 --> 00:27:07,570
We good?

319
00:27:07,635 --> 00:27:09,171
Yeah. They arrived
about 30 minutes ago.

320
00:27:09,237 --> 00:27:11,407
Should be digging in nice
and tight right about now.

321
00:27:32,729 --> 00:27:37,237
Zulu 06, Bruno 64 is wheels up. J
- Bad, enroute Bagram.

322
00:28:10,768 --> 00:28:12,438
Marcus, on me.

323
00:28:13,104 --> 00:28:16,778
Danny, take our six. Inform
command of our new position.

324
00:28:18,176 --> 00:28:20,514
Axe. Eyes on.

325
00:28:48,774 --> 00:28:50,778
Goddamn. Shit.

326
00:28:56,482 --> 00:28:58,788
That's a lot
more than 10 guys.

327
00:28:59,485 --> 00:29:01,156
That's a fucking army.

328
00:29:14,835 --> 00:29:16,838
Four guys on the right.

329
00:29:19,006 --> 00:29:20,676
Red scarf.

330
00:29:21,675 --> 00:29:23,880
No earlobes.

331
00:29:31,353 --> 00:29:32,421
Ooh!

332
00:29:33,187 --> 00:29:35,859
Super freak.
That's Rick James, bitch.

333
00:29:37,692 --> 00:29:39,128
You make that shot?

334
00:29:39,861 --> 00:29:42,901
Negative. Wouldn't
have authority anyway.

335
00:29:47,202 --> 00:29:49,874
Dietz, we got Shah P-I.D#
d. Call in Rick James.

336
00:29:49,939 --> 00:29:50,940
Fuck, yeah.

337
00:29:51,273 --> 00:29:52,743
Axe, you sexy
in there? You comfy?

338
00:29:52,808 --> 00:29:54,411
Solid. Advise on target.

339
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,547
Danny, you make comms yet?

340
00:29:56,612 --> 00:29:58,014
No joy.

341
00:29:58,381 --> 00:29:59,483
Fuck.

342
00:30:01,550 --> 00:30:02,619
We're too exposed.

343
00:30:03,719 --> 00:30:06,057
What do you think?
Keep Axe at O.P. 1?

344
00:30:06,389 --> 00:30:09,729
Move back twenty-five yards,
set up O.P. 2?

345
00:30:11,728 --> 00:30:12,896
Roger that.

346
00:30:15,165 --> 00:30:16,635
Axe,
you're on surveillance.

347
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:18,603
Dietz, fall back to O.P. 2
and get me some fucking comms.

348
00:31:19,833 --> 00:31:22,838
Spartan Base,
this is Spartan O-1.

349
00:31:23,169 --> 00:31:24,539
Radio check. How copy?

350
00:31:24,604 --> 00:31:25,939
Hey, L.T.

351
00:31:26,005 --> 00:31:27,107
Yeah.

352
00:31:27,173 --> 00:31:28,643
Ifwe're home by the 15th,
me and Morgan

353
00:31:28,708 --> 00:31:30,144
are gonna cut down all
the trees around the stable.

354
00:31:32,012 --> 00:31:33,114
How is that gonna help me?

355
00:31:33,413 --> 00:31:34,414
Hello?

356
00:31:35,349 --> 00:31:37,519
Brahms horse auction is,
I think, the 27th.

357
00:31:37,852 --> 00:31:39,989
That means if I cut down
the trees behind the stable,

358
00:31:40,054 --> 00:31:41,189
I get a discount
for your horse.

359
00:31:41,622 --> 00:31:42,957
Do they sell Arabic horses?

360
00:31:43,123 --> 00:31:46,497
First of all, it's not an Arabic
horse, okay? It's an Arabian horse.

361
00:31:46,561 --> 00:31:47,562
Arabic.

362
00:31:47,995 --> 00:31:49,765
It's...
You're from New York, okay?

363
00:31:50,698 --> 00:31:52,668
How much is an Arabic
horse? It's Arabian horse.

364
00:31:52,733 --> 00:31:54,736
How much is
an Arabian horse?

365
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:57,173
No less than 15 grand.

366
00:31:57,638 --> 00:31:58,841
Fifteen fucking grand?

367
00:31:59,207 --> 00:32:00,609
Hell of a wedding present.

368
00:32:09,718 --> 00:32:11,988
Is that redhead a bridesmaid?
Radio check. How copy?

369
00:32:12,053 --> 00:32:13,589
Melissa?
The redhead, dude.

370
00:32:13,655 --> 00:32:14,723
The one with freckles
on her nose.

371
00:32:14,790 --> 00:32:15,858
The cute one
from the Coldplay concert.

372
00:32:15,924 --> 00:32:17,260
That's Melissa.

373
00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:18,728
Is she coming?
She's a bridesmaid.

374
00:32:18,794 --> 00:32:20,631
Yeah. Is she coming?

375
00:32:23,065 --> 00:32:25,569
She's a bridesmaid. Yes.

376
00:32:25,768 --> 00:32:27,403
Did she ask about me?
No.

377
00:32:32,174 --> 00:32:34,546
Mikey, I'm good here.
I'm going to break down O.P.1.

378
00:32:35,010 --> 00:32:36,046
Copy that.

379
00:32:42,085 --> 00:32:46,259
Listen up. At 0930, we move
to high ground and make comms.

380
00:32:47,590 --> 00:32:50,697
Marcus, Axe, shut her down.
Dietz, you got security.

381
00:32:53,263 --> 00:32:54,933
Rest up, gents.

382
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:02,708
Can you get off the radio
while you're chewing?

383
00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:06,479
You're making me nauseous.

384
00:34:22,757 --> 00:34:24,360
Mikey, you see this?

385
00:34:30,465 --> 00:34:32,135
What the fuck is this?

386
00:34:42,545 --> 00:34:43,813
Oh, shit.

387
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:32,430
Get down!

388
00:35:32,497 --> 00:35:33,599
Down!

389
00:35:41,606 --> 00:35:44,278
Shut up. Shut up. Shut up.

390
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:46,378
Get up.

391
00:35:46,444 --> 00:35:47,947
Get your hands back.

392
00:35:48,013 --> 00:35:49,683
Spartan Base, Spartan O-1.

393
00:35:49,748 --> 00:35:51,083
Stepped right
the fuck on me.

394
00:35:53,284 --> 00:35:58,261
What the fuck is this? What the
fuck? Are you talking to Taliban?

395
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:01,527
Fuckin' Tali.

396
00:36:02,962 --> 00:36:06,001
Saying again.
This is Spartan O-1. Over.

397
00:36:06,465 --> 00:36:07,567
Come on. Come on.

398
00:36:08,634 --> 00:36:10,672
Hey, eyes down. Eyes down.

399
00:36:11,137 --> 00:36:12,940
Eyes down. Eyes down.

400
00:36:13,005 --> 00:36:14,073
Motherfuck.

401
00:36:14,140 --> 00:36:17,012
Axe. Eyes on him,
what he does.

402
00:36:30,657 --> 00:36:31,826
Fuck.

403
00:36:32,358 --> 00:36:35,431
Spartan Base,
this is Spartan O-1. Over.

404
00:36:39,833 --> 00:36:41,236
Danny, your radio working?

405
00:36:44,004 --> 00:36:45,307
So now I'm going to
be that guy

406
00:36:45,906 --> 00:36:48,811
calling on an unsecure sat line
because your shit ain't functioning.

407
00:36:48,875 --> 00:36:49,912
Talk to the mountain, sir.

408
00:36:50,344 --> 00:36:52,147
Eyes down. Eyes down.

409
00:36:54,849 --> 00:36:56,351
Motherfuck.

410
00:37:03,124 --> 00:37:04,794
You know,
it's feeling like a cursed op.

411
00:37:05,194 --> 00:37:07,765
It's not a cursed op.
There's no curses.

412
00:37:07,829 --> 00:37:09,399
It's iust Afghanistan.
That's all.

413
00:37:17,039 --> 00:37:18,642
J- Bad TOC,
Sergeant Hasslert speaking.

414
00:37:18,708 --> 00:37:21,647
Sergeant, this is Spartan O-1.
Do you hear me?

415
00:37:23,045 --> 00:37:24,213
Hello.

416
00:37:24,547 --> 00:37:25,982
Sergeant,
this is Spartan O-1.

417
00:37:26,815 --> 00:37:28,186
Yes, yes,
I can hear you, sir.

418
00:37:28,251 --> 00:37:30,321
I am calling on
an unsecure line.

419
00:37:30,386 --> 00:37:31,921
I need to speak
to the C.O. immediately.

420
00:37:31,988 --> 00:37:33,891
The C.O.?
That's correct.

421
00:37:33,957 --> 00:37:35,092
Which C.O., sir?

422
00:37:35,158 --> 00:37:36,326
Commander Kristensen.

423
00:37:37,326 --> 00:37:38,863
Commander Kristensen
isn't here, sir.

424
00:37:39,295 --> 00:37:40,397
Ah, he's at Bagram.

425
00:37:40,731 --> 00:37:41,899
Yes, that's correct, sir.

426
00:37:42,331 --> 00:37:44,704
I need you to transfer me
to Bagram Ouellette TOC.

427
00:37:45,035 --> 00:37:46,170
Now.

428
00:37:46,236 --> 00:37:47,405
Roger that, sir. Stand by.

429
00:37:56,747 --> 00:37:57,883
Ouellette.
Petty Officer Patton.

430
00:37:58,348 --> 00:38:00,119
Patton, Mike Murphy.

431
00:38:00,350 --> 00:38:01,754
You're looking
for Mike Murphy?

432
00:38:01,819 --> 00:38:03,656
This is Mike Murphy.
Do you copy?

433
00:38:03,821 --> 00:38:04,956
Mike?

434
00:38:06,223 --> 00:38:08,193
This connection sucks.
What's up, man?

435
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,563
Patton, get me
the Skipper now.

436
00:38:11,162 --> 00:38:12,331
He's sleeping, sir.

437
00:38:12,397 --> 00:38:13,732
Wake him the fuck up.

438
00:38:15,700 --> 00:38:17,070
Did you say wake him up, sir?

439
00:38:17,535 --> 00:38:19,138
Right fucking now.

440
00:38:19,204 --> 00:38:20,573
Roger that.

441
00:38:22,440 --> 00:38:23,843
Murph wants me to
wake the Skipper.

442
00:38:24,710 --> 00:38:26,279
Mike Murphy?
Yeah.

443
00:38:26,344 --> 00:38:28,281
That's Mike Murphy?
Well, go get him.

444
00:38:40,892 --> 00:38:42,229
Commander Kristensen?

445
00:38:43,629 --> 00:38:44,965
Commander Kristensen?

446
00:38:48,467 --> 00:38:50,070
Sir, sorry, sir.

447
00:38:50,136 --> 00:38:51,806
I got Lieutenant Murphy on
the phone for you in the TOC.

448
00:38:51,871 --> 00:38:53,106
He says he
needs to talk to you now.

449
00:39:05,652 --> 00:39:06,788
Which one?

450
00:39:06,854 --> 00:39:07,956
Right there.

451
00:39:10,124 --> 00:39:12,161
Mike? Mike?

452
00:39:13,527 --> 00:39:14,696
Oh, it dropped.

453
00:39:15,329 --> 00:39:16,432
Mike?

454
00:39:17,131 --> 00:39:19,168
It's dead.
What did he say?

455
00:39:19,834 --> 00:39:21,237
Uh, iust that
he needed to talk to you.

456
00:39:23,003 --> 00:39:24,673
Why is Murphy
calling on a satphone?

457
00:39:24,739 --> 00:39:26,309
No idea.

458
00:39:26,941 --> 00:39:29,446
Are we having comms problems
with Spartan O-1?

459
00:39:29,510 --> 00:39:32,515
We were good for a while, but
we've missed two windows now, sir.

460
00:39:32,947 --> 00:39:34,116
Two.

461
00:39:34,850 --> 00:39:37,054
Try him back!
For fuck's sake.

462
00:39:57,039 --> 00:39:59,544
Fuck! Worst fucking comms.

463
00:39:59,876 --> 00:40:01,278
Well, we could light
the goats on fire,

464
00:40:01,344 --> 00:40:02,345
smoke signal our way
out of here.

465
00:40:02,545 --> 00:40:04,882
Yeah, I could walk down to the
village, ask to borrow a phone.

466
00:40:04,947 --> 00:40:07,352
You'd get some interesting
tile ideas down there, bro.

467
00:40:07,417 --> 00:40:09,254
Afghan Dirt Brown,
Goat Skin Blond.

468
00:40:09,319 --> 00:40:10,654
Shit, she'll dig that
a hell of a lot more than,

469
00:40:10,720 --> 00:40:11,989
what is it,
fucking Honey Cream?

470
00:40:18,228 --> 00:40:20,600
Sit down. Sit down!

471
00:40:34,011 --> 00:40:35,614
Way I see it,
we got three options.

472
00:40:37,415 --> 00:40:40,320
One, we let them go, hike up.

473
00:40:41,419 --> 00:40:43,457
We'll probably be
found in less than an hour.

474
00:40:44,088 --> 00:40:47,361
Two, we tie them up,
hike out, roll the dice.

475
00:40:48,092 --> 00:40:51,899
They'll probably be eaten by
fucking wolves, or freeze to death.

476
00:40:56,501 --> 00:40:57,569
Three?

477
00:40:57,635 --> 00:40:59,139
We terminate the compromise.

478
00:41:16,522 --> 00:41:20,096
Shah's down there. We let them go,
we're letting him go. Mission fails.

479
00:41:28,902 --> 00:41:30,237
No, Mikey.

480
00:41:30,971 --> 00:41:34,043
I don't like it. I don't
fucking like it at all.

481
00:41:34,308 --> 00:41:36,812
What are we gonna do?
We gonna kill them? Huh?

482
00:41:36,877 --> 00:41:39,916
Okay, we kill them, right? What,
then what? Fucking bury 'em?

483
00:41:40,414 --> 00:41:41,549
They get found, then what?

484
00:41:41,782 --> 00:41:42,951
Then what?

485
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:44,552
What do you mean, then what?

486
00:41:44,618 --> 00:41:46,221
And then what?

487
00:41:46,687 --> 00:41:48,090
You know then what.

488
00:41:48,990 --> 00:41:50,459
What do you think?
This shit's gonna be private?

489
00:41:50,525 --> 00:41:52,595
Huh? It's gonna be out there
for the whole fucking world.

490
00:41:52,994 --> 00:41:55,599
CNN, okay?
"SEALs kill kids. "

491
00:41:55,663 --> 00:41:56,998
That's the fucking story
forever.

492
00:41:57,064 --> 00:41:58,934
It's nobody's fucking
business what we do up here.

493
00:42:00,835 --> 00:42:04,175
We do what we do.
What we have to do.

494
00:42:04,772 --> 00:42:06,910
This is the fucking Navy
and you're the fucking boss,

495
00:42:06,975 --> 00:42:09,245
so you make
the fucking call, sir.

496
00:42:15,017 --> 00:42:17,555
Shah killed 20
Marines last week.

497
00:42:18,554 --> 00:42:19,756
Twenty.

498
00:42:21,457 --> 00:42:24,964
We let him go, 20 more
will die next week.

499
00:42:25,028 --> 00:42:28,367
Forty more the week after
that. Our job is to stop Shah.

500
00:42:30,433 --> 00:42:33,372
Why do these men have the right
to dictate how we do ourjob?

501
00:42:34,003 --> 00:42:36,173
Rules of Engagement says
we cannot touch them.

502
00:42:36,873 --> 00:42:38,343
I understand.

503
00:42:39,042 --> 00:42:40,678
And I don't care.

504
00:42:42,579 --> 00:42:45,529
I care about you.
I care about you.

505
00:42:45,851 --> 00:42:47,551
I care about you.
I care about you.

506
00:42:47,750 --> 00:42:50,490
I don't want your
mom seeing your head,

507
00:42:51,055 --> 00:42:53,693
your decapitated
head on Al Jazeera.

508
00:42:55,059 --> 00:42:56,194
That is Shah.

509
00:42:56,727 --> 00:42:58,362
I don't see it that way.

510
00:42:59,063 --> 00:43:02,503
Where do you think he's running
to? 200 friends down there.

511
00:43:02,567 --> 00:43:05,806
Got guys in Leavenworth doing
20 for taking home trophy guns.

512
00:43:05,870 --> 00:43:06,938
What do you think
they're gonna do

513
00:43:07,004 --> 00:43:09,576
for two fucking kids
and an old fucking man?

514
00:43:10,174 --> 00:43:11,477
Fucking look at them, man.

515
00:43:13,744 --> 00:43:15,047
They fucking hate us.

516
00:43:15,413 --> 00:43:20,356
Look, at him. That's not a kid, that's
a soldier. That's death. Look at death.

517
00:43:20,785 --> 00:43:22,155
We can't do it.
Look at that soldier.

518
00:43:22,220 --> 00:43:24,157
They are unarmed prisoners.

519
00:43:24,423 --> 00:43:28,430
And the second they run down there,
we got 200 hajis on our backs.

520
00:43:28,494 --> 00:43:29,729
Tie 'em up.

521
00:43:29,794 --> 00:43:30,963
Tie 'em up. Let's get
the fuck out of here.

522
00:43:31,030 --> 00:43:33,100
We can't just fucking
leave 'em, let 'em go!

523
00:43:33,165 --> 00:43:35,035
I thought you were standing by
waiting for your fucking orders?

524
00:43:35,101 --> 00:43:36,971
I am standing by
waiting for my fucking orders.

525
00:43:37,036 --> 00:43:38,405
What do you think
that radio's for?

526
00:43:38,470 --> 00:43:39,973
They're not
calling Domino's Pizza.

527
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:41,274
I know what
the fucking radio's for.

528
00:43:41,340 --> 00:43:42,643
That radio's fucking Tali.

529
00:43:42,708 --> 00:43:44,044
It's a cell phone
to the Taliban.

530
00:43:44,209 --> 00:43:46,949
So you just think it'll just
be our little secret? Huh?

531
00:43:49,949 --> 00:43:51,452
That's a warrior.

532
00:43:51,684 --> 00:43:52,752
Schwack them.

533
00:43:54,454 --> 00:43:56,324
We cannot do that.

534
00:43:56,389 --> 00:43:58,459
This is a soft compromise.

535
00:43:58,525 --> 00:43:59,660
You want to
go to Leavenworth?

536
00:43:59,726 --> 00:44:01,831
You don't know how many hajis
they have down there, man.

537
00:44:01,895 --> 00:44:03,097
Don't let him influence you.

538
00:44:03,163 --> 00:44:04,398
Marcus, I'm iust saying,
you can't just say...

539
00:44:04,464 --> 00:44:05,700
Look at that child.

540
00:44:05,766 --> 00:44:07,569
Make up your fucking mind and
don't let him influence you.

541
00:44:07,635 --> 00:44:08,670
Schwack them.

542
00:44:08,735 --> 00:44:10,506
Mikey, it's your fucking
call. I ain't fucking voting.

543
00:44:10,571 --> 00:44:12,308
This is not a vote.

544
00:44:13,641 --> 00:44:17,448
This is what we're gonna do.
This op is compromised.

545
00:44:20,815 --> 00:44:23,352
So we're going to
pack up everything.

546
00:44:23,651 --> 00:44:26,691
We're gonna cut them loose
and we're gonna make this peak.

547
00:44:26,754 --> 00:44:29,760
When we make this peak,
you're gonna get comms up.

548
00:44:29,991 --> 00:44:34,500
When we get these comms up, we're gonna
call for extract and we're going home.

549
00:44:35,830 --> 00:44:36,932
Roger that, sir.

550
00:44:36,998 --> 00:44:38,701
Roger that.
Roger.

551
00:44:38,766 --> 00:44:40,704
Spartan O-1.
Spartan O-1, do you copy?

552
00:44:40,768 --> 00:44:42,439
Fisher? Coffee.

553
00:44:43,338 --> 00:44:46,077
Spartan O-1,
radio check, do you copy?

554
00:44:50,012 --> 00:44:54,454
Radio check for Spartan O-1.
Radio check. Spartan O-1.

555
00:44:58,854 --> 00:45:02,194
Spartan O-1...
Spartan O-1, do you copy?

556
00:45:07,864 --> 00:45:09,299
Where are you guys going?

557
00:45:09,733 --> 00:45:11,135
Just got called north!

558
00:45:11,201 --> 00:45:12,369
We're QRF!

559
00:45:12,435 --> 00:45:13,771
We have troops in contact!

560
00:45:13,837 --> 00:45:15,373
But we're fucking QRF!

561
00:45:15,439 --> 00:45:17,776
We're going! We have TIC!

562
00:45:25,649 --> 00:45:27,252
What the fuck is
with the Apaches?

563
00:45:27,317 --> 00:45:28,520
Troops in contact.

564
00:45:28,585 --> 00:45:32,292
Limited resources, Chief.
There ain't enough Apaches.

565
00:45:33,891 --> 00:45:35,193
That's fucked up.

566
00:45:35,493 --> 00:45:36,895
They'll be back.

567
00:45:52,277 --> 00:45:53,545
Hey. Hey.

568
00:45:54,579 --> 00:45:56,349
You just won the lottery.

569
00:47:38,521 --> 00:47:41,827
Any station, listen up.
Please relay to Spartan O-1.

570
00:47:43,559 --> 00:47:45,698
Spartan to base,
do you copy?

571
00:47:46,797 --> 00:47:50,604
Spartan O-1, Spartan
O-1 to base, do you copy?

572
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:16,429
Fuck.

573
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:38,586
Oh, fuck!

574
00:48:43,589 --> 00:48:45,059
False summit.

575
00:48:55,101 --> 00:48:56,436
Fuck!
Yeah.

576
00:48:57,437 --> 00:48:58,973
Danny, get me some comms.

577
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,379
Come on. Spartan Base,
this is Spartan O-1. Over.

578
00:49:02,609 --> 00:49:04,312
What do you want to do?

579
00:49:04,378 --> 00:49:07,049
Go home. Get in bed, watch Anchorman.

580
00:49:07,281 --> 00:49:08,650
Yeah, roger that.
What do you think?

581
00:49:09,116 --> 00:49:10,885
I think we did
the right thing.

582
00:49:10,952 --> 00:49:12,054
I think we let
our love light shine.

583
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:13,955
Fuck me!

584
00:49:14,455 --> 00:49:16,325
I mean, isn't that
how things work?

585
00:49:16,390 --> 00:49:17,926
Good things
happen to good people?

586
00:49:18,392 --> 00:49:19,561
This is a bad spot.

587
00:49:20,561 --> 00:49:22,666
Danny, I got nothing here
on sat. Give me something.

588
00:49:22,730 --> 00:49:23,765
I don't have fucking shit.

589
00:49:24,966 --> 00:49:26,068
How do you feel?

590
00:49:26,133 --> 00:49:27,870
This is a bad spot.

591
00:49:28,803 --> 00:49:30,139
You okay?

592
00:49:30,372 --> 00:49:31,474
All set.

593
00:49:31,806 --> 00:49:35,613
Good. Let's fall back to that
tree line. Wait till sundown.

594
00:49:35,676 --> 00:49:37,614
If we can't make comms, we're
walking home anyways, gents.

595
00:49:37,678 --> 00:49:39,082
Let's get some rest.

596
00:49:39,147 --> 00:49:40,917
Pack up, let's move.

597
00:49:41,383 --> 00:49:43,053
Fuck.

598
00:49:53,162 --> 00:49:55,499
Spartan O-1,
Spartan to base, do you copy?

599
00:49:56,332 --> 00:49:59,004
Spartan O-1,
radio check, do you copy?

600
00:49:59,335 --> 00:50:01,605
Sir, they've now
missed three windows.

601
00:50:04,507 --> 00:50:05,776
Okay.

602
00:50:13,150 --> 00:50:15,754
Commander Shriyer, there's
a call for you on line 17.

603
00:50:15,819 --> 00:50:16,988
Roger.

604
00:50:22,259 --> 00:50:23,427
Commander Shriver.

605
00:50:23,727 --> 00:50:24,796
Uh, sir, this is Erik.

606
00:50:24,862 --> 00:50:28,970
For your S.A., we have missed
three comm windows with Spartan O-1.

607
00:50:29,467 --> 00:50:32,104
Last known comms were at 0700.

608
00:50:32,169 --> 00:50:33,372
Why am I hearing this
from you right now?

609
00:50:34,038 --> 00:50:36,576
Sir, we expected
to have some comms problems.

610
00:50:36,974 --> 00:50:39,813
Murphy and I discussed and agreed
that we would not start a spin

611
00:50:39,877 --> 00:50:41,413
until after
he missed two windows.

612
00:50:41,880 --> 00:50:43,682
Is there
a fucking problem here, Erik?

613
00:50:44,549 --> 00:50:46,386
Sir, I've told you everything
I have at this point.

614
00:50:46,451 --> 00:50:48,321
I will call you when I
have more information.

615
00:50:48,386 --> 00:50:50,223
This is
Commander Kristensen out.

616
00:50:52,290 --> 00:50:53,393
Fuck.

617
00:52:22,818 --> 00:52:26,392
I'm going to do some recon.
Be back in two minutes.

618
00:52:26,822 --> 00:52:29,127
You want some company?
Negative.

619
00:52:33,262 --> 00:52:36,837
I'm going to do about two
minutes of recon. Be right back.

620
00:53:40,233 --> 00:53:42,670
We're about to get contacted.

621
00:53:51,077 --> 00:53:52,947
How fucking fast
are these guys?

622
00:53:53,012 --> 00:53:54,114
Fast.

623
00:53:54,947 --> 00:53:56,050
What are you thinking?

624
00:53:57,417 --> 00:54:00,089
I'm thinking we're about getting fixing
to get into a pretty good gun fight.

625
00:54:00,687 --> 00:54:01,722
Copy that.

626
00:54:02,855 --> 00:54:04,526
Looks like I voted wrong.

627
00:54:05,425 --> 00:54:06,693
Negative.

628
00:54:07,194 --> 00:54:08,396
We just got the opportunity

629
00:54:08,461 --> 00:54:11,434
to make hell fucking strong contact
with our friend from the other side.

630
00:54:11,498 --> 00:54:12,634
Job well done.

631
00:54:13,400 --> 00:54:14,870
Hoo-yah to that, sir.

632
00:54:17,237 --> 00:54:19,609
Danny, get ready to fight.

633
00:54:29,017 --> 00:54:30,352
Hey, Mikey...

634
00:54:32,486 --> 00:54:34,390
I'm about ready to
punch that timecard.

635
00:54:34,756 --> 00:54:35,757
Do it.

636
00:55:26,209 --> 00:55:28,714
Push left!
Marcus, move!

637
00:55:58,643 --> 00:55:59,644
Moving!

638
00:56:31,945 --> 00:56:33,615
Motherfucker.

639
00:56:52,734 --> 00:56:54,771
Spartan Base,
this is Spartan O-1.

640
00:56:55,770 --> 00:56:58,175
Request immediate QRF!
Troops in contact!

641
00:57:00,375 --> 00:57:02,779
Fuck! Fuck.

642
00:57:08,283 --> 00:57:10,788
Fucking shit!
Motherfuck!

643
00:57:11,653 --> 00:57:12,789
Motherfucker!

644
00:57:22,531 --> 00:57:23,532
Allahu Akbar!

645
00:57:27,069 --> 00:57:28,907
Contact, twelve o'clock!

646
00:57:50,660 --> 00:57:51,728
Axe?

647
00:57:52,396 --> 00:57:53,431
Yeah.

648
00:57:59,703 --> 00:58:01,874
Mikey.
Left is good.

649
00:58:02,072 --> 00:58:03,642
I say again,
left is good.

650
00:58:11,883 --> 00:58:13,051
Mikey!

651
00:58:13,384 --> 00:58:16,758
Left is not good! I say
again, left is not good!

652
00:58:16,822 --> 00:58:17,924
Roger that!
Push right!

653
00:58:35,707 --> 00:58:37,343
We are good right.

654
00:58:37,743 --> 00:58:39,580
Push right. Push right.

655
00:58:39,645 --> 00:58:40,647
Push right.

656
00:58:44,116 --> 00:58:45,385
Murph, down!

657
00:58:49,322 --> 00:58:50,857
Goddamn motherfuckers!

658
00:58:51,724 --> 00:58:53,561
Fuck you!

659
00:58:56,329 --> 00:58:57,764
Smoke out!

660
00:58:58,198 --> 00:59:00,368
Hey! Consolidate on Mikey!

661
00:59:11,912 --> 00:59:13,582
Shit! Fuck!

662
00:59:16,250 --> 00:59:18,387
Right is no good!
Right is no good!

663
00:59:19,353 --> 00:59:20,421
Move!

664
00:59:27,596 --> 00:59:29,933
Back! Back!

665
00:59:31,699 --> 00:59:32,768
First man!

666
00:59:33,735 --> 00:59:36,307
Mikey! Consolidate on me!

667
00:59:46,081 --> 00:59:47,216
Fuck.

668
00:59:57,627 --> 00:59:59,931
I think we can take 'em, Mikey,
but we're gonna need a new spot!

669
01:00:00,029 --> 01:00:02,267
Roger that!
Danny, comms!

670
01:00:02,398 --> 01:00:05,403
Negative! Radio's down
hard, it took some rounds!

671
01:00:06,136 --> 01:00:07,806
You got crypto?
Yeah!

672
01:00:08,071 --> 01:00:09,707
Gas the fucking radio,
we're moving!

673
01:00:09,873 --> 01:00:10,941
Roger that!

674
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:13,877
Shit!

675
01:00:17,581 --> 01:00:18,950
Ow, fuck!

676
01:00:20,151 --> 01:00:21,720
Ow! Fuck!

677
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,924
Marcus, on me!

678
01:00:27,825 --> 01:00:29,160
Fuck!

679
01:00:30,995 --> 01:00:32,330
We're falling back!

680
01:00:32,463 --> 01:00:33,566
You mean fall off?

681
01:00:33,631 --> 01:00:34,966
Yeah!
Fuck!

682
01:00:35,032 --> 01:00:36,300
Axe!

683
01:00:36,834 --> 01:00:38,504
Axe, on me!

684
01:00:38,736 --> 01:00:41,006
Ready? Move it!

685
01:00:44,008 --> 01:00:45,511
Ready?
Roger!

686
01:00:45,577 --> 01:00:47,080
Go, go, go!

687
01:00:54,987 --> 01:00:56,055
Jesus.

688
01:00:57,222 --> 01:00:58,290
Shit.

689
01:01:00,759 --> 01:01:02,762
Oh, my God.

690
01:01:07,533 --> 01:01:08,635
Fuck.

691
01:01:48,842 --> 01:01:50,179
I lost my rifle.

692
01:01:51,379 --> 01:01:53,883
My rifle. My...

693
01:01:57,451 --> 01:01:58,587
Shit.

694
01:02:11,032 --> 01:02:13,035
You see?
God's looking out for us.

695
01:02:13,101 --> 01:02:16,842
If that's God looking out for
us, I'd hate to see him pissed.

696
01:02:17,206 --> 01:02:19,878
Oh, God... thank you,
thank you!

697
01:02:22,978 --> 01:02:24,414
Where's Axe?

698
01:02:26,115 --> 01:02:27,852
That sucked.

699
01:02:29,351 --> 01:02:31,154
They fuck...
They fucking shot me.

700
01:02:31,220 --> 01:02:32,423
Livin' in the past, Danny.

701
01:02:32,488 --> 01:02:33,657
We're all shot, bro.
Can you fight?

702
01:02:33,923 --> 01:02:36,828
Messed up my drawing
hand, that pisses me off.

703
01:02:38,528 --> 01:02:40,832
All right, we're good.

I got two mags, one frag.

733
01:05:23,200 --> 01:05:24,703
Hey.

734
01:05:29,607 --> 01:05:30,942
Oh, man.

735
01:05:31,108 --> 01:05:32,311
Hey.

736
01:05:32,443 --> 01:05:33,745
Oh.

737
01:05:33,844 --> 01:05:35,447
This is bad here.

738
01:05:35,546 --> 01:05:36,748
Mmm.

739
01:05:36,814 --> 01:05:37,916
This is a fucking problem.

740
01:05:39,717 --> 01:05:41,387
Fucking no comms.

741
01:05:41,786 --> 01:05:43,189
Fucking comms.

742
01:05:43,654 --> 01:05:45,257
You're okay, right? Shot
me up pretty good, bro.

743
01:05:47,893 --> 01:05:49,730
This hand, let me see.

744
01:05:51,830 --> 01:05:55,304
You're all right. Look
at me. Hey, look at me.

745
01:05:55,767 --> 01:05:57,637
You okay? Huh?

746
01:05:57,702 --> 01:06:00,208
Suck it the fuck up, okay,
Danny? You're a fucking frogman.

747
01:06:00,906 --> 01:06:03,144
Fuck, I lost my med kit.

748
01:06:03,208 --> 01:06:05,580
You got a little hit in
the leg, okay? Lookit here.

749
01:06:05,912 --> 01:06:07,214
You okay?

750
01:06:08,514 --> 01:06:10,117
Hold on. Okay.

751
01:06:10,482 --> 01:06:11,885
There.

752
01:06:11,951 --> 01:06:16,292
Okay? Okay. Okay.
Lay back. Lay back.

753
01:06:16,923 --> 01:06:19,762
Let me see, Mikey. Come

754
01:06:20,993 --> 01:06:22,262
Fuck.

755
01:06:25,265 --> 01:06:27,168
You pack it with some fuckin'
dirt, tight, you hear me?

756
01:06:27,334 --> 01:06:29,671
Keep it packed tight,
all right?

757
01:06:30,070 --> 01:06:32,474
I fucking love Afghanistan.

758
01:06:33,006 --> 01:06:34,576
Come here, buddy. Hold up.
Yeah, we're all set.

759
01:06:34,641 --> 01:06:36,479
Let me see.
Let me see you.

760
01:06:36,544 --> 01:06:37,679
Get your head down.
Let me see.

761
01:06:37,744 --> 01:06:38,780
All right, heads down.
Get your head down.

762
01:06:38,846 --> 01:06:41,150
Let me see you. Come here.
Keep your head down.

763
01:06:42,783 --> 01:06:44,119
Let me see you.
I'm good.

764
01:06:44,185 --> 01:06:46,789
Yeah, I know you're good.
I know you're good. Easy.

765
01:06:47,121 --> 01:06:49,191
Mikey, how'd they get us
so fast? Shut the fuck up!

766
01:06:52,060 --> 01:06:53,730
Do you fucking see them?

767
01:06:53,795 --> 01:06:54,997
Bro...

768
01:06:55,697 --> 01:06:59,303
I just don't understand how
fucking fast they were, man.

769
01:06:59,568 --> 01:07:01,438
Oh, fuck. I just...

770
01:07:02,036 --> 01:07:03,539
Fucking faster
than we are?

771
01:07:04,105 --> 01:07:05,274
They're not faster than us.

772
01:07:05,773 --> 01:07:07,911
I was fucking talkin'
to my mom.

773
01:07:07,976 --> 01:07:10,614
She didn't fuckin'
say nothin' about...

774
01:07:10,678 --> 01:07:12,015
She didn't fucking say nothing!
Danny, suck it the fuck up.

775
01:07:20,523 --> 01:07:23,462
Oh, fuck,
such vivid reds. Oh!

776
01:07:23,692 --> 01:07:25,028
We got to move, Mikey.

777
01:07:36,940 --> 01:07:38,843
Fuck.
Mikey, what do you want?

778
01:07:38,909 --> 01:07:40,077
Axe, smoke!

779
01:07:40,343 --> 01:07:41,378
Smoke up!

780
01:07:41,444 --> 01:07:42,547
Smoke 'em!

781
01:07:42,613 --> 01:07:44,315
Oh, they're coming!

782
01:07:45,849 --> 01:07:48,053
Get the fuck up and get
your fucking legs working,

783
01:07:48,151 --> 01:07:49,287
you hear me?
Yeah.

784
01:07:49,353 --> 01:07:50,688
Come on, let's go!

785
01:07:56,826 --> 01:07:57,863
Let's go!

786
01:07:59,096 --> 01:08:00,766
You got Danny?
I got him.

787
01:08:00,831 --> 01:08:02,669
Axe, we're moving down!
Move where?

788
01:08:03,267 --> 01:08:04,435
Down!

789
01:08:05,670 --> 01:08:06,705
Good to go.

790
01:08:18,951 --> 01:08:20,453
Danny! Danny!

791
01:09:26,354 --> 01:09:28,691
RPG. RPG.

792
01:09:32,927 --> 01:09:33,996
Fuck!

793
01:09:45,274 --> 01:09:46,275
You good Danny?

794
01:09:48,944 --> 01:09:50,714
Where's Danny? Where's
Danny? I don't see him.

795
01:09:52,514 --> 01:09:54,284
Is he hit?
Is he hit?

796
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:55,418
Is he hit?

797
01:09:56,118 --> 01:09:58,121
Where is he? Where's
Danny? I don't see him.

798
01:09:58,254 --> 01:09:59,255
Where is he?

799
01:09:59,655 --> 01:10:01,158
He's up top.
What?

800
01:10:01,223 --> 01:10:02,793
He's up top. He got...
Where?

801
01:10:02,859 --> 01:10:04,127
He got hit in the head. Up top where?

802
01:10:04,194 --> 01:10:05,462
Fuck.

803
01:10:05,628 --> 01:10:07,198
We gotta go get him.
Up top where?

804
01:10:07,264 --> 01:10:08,265
We got to go get him.
Up top.

805
01:10:08,565 --> 01:10:10,168
Where's Danny?
Did he get hit?

806
01:10:10,233 --> 01:10:11,268
We got to go get him.
We gotta get him.

807
01:10:11,368 --> 01:10:12,470
We got to get up
there and get him.

808
01:10:12,535 --> 01:10:14,372
We can take 'em on flat
ground. We gotta get up top.

809
01:10:14,504 --> 01:10:16,040
We get up there, we get him,
get him down the hill,

810
01:10:16,106 --> 01:10:17,541
and them we can take 'em on flat
ground. We take 'em on flat ground.

811
01:10:17,741 --> 01:10:19,176
Fuck!

812
01:10:22,580 --> 01:10:24,917
Come on!
Axe, get up here now!

813
01:10:25,349 --> 01:10:26,350
Get him up here.

814
01:10:26,417 --> 01:10:28,254
Come on, Axe,
you gotta get down!

815
01:10:49,507 --> 01:10:50,910
Oh, fuck!

816
01:10:51,543 --> 01:10:53,513
We're gonna go
get Danny up top

817
01:10:53,578 --> 01:10:55,682
and then we're gonna come back
down and fight on flat ground,

818
01:10:55,780 --> 01:10:57,550
we're gonna kill 'em all.

819
01:10:57,616 --> 01:10:58,718
Marcus, you good?

820
01:10:59,885 --> 01:11:00,987
I'm good!

821
01:11:01,086 --> 01:11:02,923
Axe, you're security,
and let's go.

822
01:11:02,988 --> 01:11:04,290
Roger.

823
01:11:04,356 --> 01:11:05,458
Let's move.

824
01:11:10,228 --> 01:11:11,565
Moving!

825
01:11:18,138 --> 01:11:19,473
Let's move!

826
01:11:27,981 --> 01:11:30,419
You can die for your country.
I'm going to live for mine.

827
01:11:31,518 --> 01:11:32,620
Fuck.

828
01:11:34,053 --> 01:11:35,157
Fuck!

829
01:11:39,259 --> 01:11:41,063
Marcus, move!

830
01:11:41,828 --> 01:11:43,164
Moving!

831
01:11:55,276 --> 01:11:56,846
I don't think
we can get up from here.

832
01:11:56,911 --> 01:11:58,247
We ain't out-fuckin'- flankin'
'em, Mikey.

833
01:11:59,347 --> 01:12:00,882
We got to find another way.

834
01:12:19,235 --> 01:12:20,570
M-4.

835
01:12:22,538 --> 01:12:24,875
I'm going to make
the call to QRF.

836
01:12:25,141 --> 01:12:27,645
You ain't making no fuckin'
comms with that sat phone, Mikey.

837
01:12:27,977 --> 01:12:29,312
Look at me.

838
01:12:30,546 --> 01:12:32,651
I'm going to make the call.

839
01:12:37,721 --> 01:12:39,724
No. No, Mikey.

840
01:12:41,324 --> 01:12:42,894
No. Fuck that.

841
01:12:50,434 --> 01:12:53,406
No. No.
Fuck that, Mikey.

842
01:12:54,137 --> 01:12:55,741
Take it.
You fuckin' take it.

843
01:12:57,708 --> 01:12:58,976
Mikey,
give me the fuckin'...

844
01:13:15,126 --> 01:13:16,127
I'm sorry, Mike.

845
01:13:16,928 --> 01:13:18,196
For what?

846
01:13:20,766 --> 01:13:22,469
That we haven't killed
more of these fuckers.

847
01:13:23,001 --> 01:13:26,541
Oh, don't be fuckin' sorry. We're
gonna fuckin' kill way more of 'em.

848
01:13:28,173 --> 01:13:29,175
Fuck!

849
01:13:34,613 --> 01:13:35,782
Marcus.

850
01:13:38,550 --> 01:13:40,287
Never out of the fight.

851
01:13:51,631 --> 01:13:53,134
What's he doing,
Marcus?

852
01:13:53,966 --> 01:13:56,438
Murphy's moving!
Murphy's moving!

853
01:14:02,175 --> 01:14:03,845
Where is he going?

854
01:14:15,323 --> 01:14:16,993
Oh, fuck!

855
01:14:22,229 --> 01:14:23,498
Murphy's moving!

856
01:14:34,242 --> 01:14:35,311
Oh, fuck.

857
01:14:44,619 --> 01:14:46,222
I am the Reaper.

858
01:14:57,867 --> 01:14:58,902
Fuck.

01:16:02,501 --> 01:16:06,442
This is Lieutenant

863
01:16:06,939 --> 01:16:08,709
We need
immediate air support.

864
01:16:12,812 --> 01:16:13,947
We need help.

865
01:16:14,046 --> 01:16:18,623
We are heading down the ravine
towards the Chichal Village.

866
01:16:19,519 --> 01:16:20,520
Roger that, Murphy.

867
01:16:20,754 --> 01:16:23,191

01:16:25,925 --> 01:16:26,960

Murphy, I need those grids. Thank you.

871
01:16:28,895 --> 01:16:31,433
Oh, God.

No go! You're grounded!

882
01:18:14,839 --> 01:18:16,609
What's the fucking problem?

883
01:18:16,674 --> 01:18:19,447
These Black Hawks cannot fly
without Apache cover!

884
01:18:20,212 --> 01:18:22,215
Where are
the fucking Apaches?

885
01:18:22,480 --> 01:18:24,551
On their way back now.
They're turning around.

886
01:18:24,883 --> 01:18:26,553
This is fucking
unbelievable!

887
01:18:26,618 --> 01:18:27,619
No shit!

888
01:18:30,055 --> 01:18:32,092
Sir, we are four mikes out
from the zone.

889
01:18:32,157 --> 01:18:33,158
Four mikes!

890
01:18:33,992 --> 01:18:35,663
Look alive, gentlemen.

891
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:40,738
Bruno 64 report Mike Bravo
plus five. Altimeter 2998.

892
01:18:58,552 --> 01:19:00,054
Where's Mike?

893
01:19:03,957 --> 01:19:05,293
Where's Murphy?

894
01:19:05,859 --> 01:19:07,095
Up top.

895
01:19:07,661 --> 01:19:09,164
Where up top?

896
01:19:09,330 --> 01:19:10,398
He's getting the QRF.

897
01:19:14,902 --> 01:19:15,937
Where exactly is Mike?

898
01:19:16,070 --> 01:19:19,744
If I knew exactly where the fuck
he was, I would tell you, brother!

899
01:19:19,807 --> 01:19:21,610
Is he squared away?

900
01:19:22,877 --> 01:19:24,780
Oh, fuck. Let me see you.

901
01:19:25,647 --> 01:19:26,949
Oh.

902
01:19:27,882 --> 01:19:29,552
Motherfuckers.

903
01:19:31,019 --> 01:19:33,022
Did they really shoot me
in the fucking head?

904
01:19:34,356 --> 01:19:35,792
Yeah, buddy.

905
01:19:51,039 --> 01:19:53,377
Are Mikey and
Danny really dead?

906
01:19:56,012 --> 01:19:57,514
I don't know.

907
01:19:58,982 --> 01:20:00,384
Are we dead?

908
01:20:01,784 --> 01:20:02,987
Negative.

909
01:20:04,621 --> 01:20:06,323
We're good, right?

910
01:20:06,490 --> 01:20:07,491
Fuck, yeah.

911
01:20:08,024 --> 01:20:09,460
We're solid.

912
01:20:14,831 --> 01:20:18,371
If I die,
I need you to make sure

913
01:20:18,435 --> 01:20:22,276
that Cindy knows
how much I love her.

914
01:20:22,339 --> 01:20:23,374
She knows.

915
01:20:23,440 --> 01:20:25,778
And that I died
with my brothers

916
01:20:27,578 --> 01:20:29,415
with a full fucking heart.

917
01:20:33,951 --> 01:20:35,988
You're not dying, Axe.
We're not gonna...

918
01:20:38,789 --> 01:20:41,594
We gotta spread out. Get
yourself some real estate.

919
01:20:48,967 --> 01:20:50,202
64, be advised.

920
01:20:50,268 --> 01:20:53,675
Negative Apache support.
LZ is too hot. Stand down.

921
01:20:53,739 --> 01:20:54,807
What's the problem?

922
01:20:54,906 --> 01:20:57,244
The Apaches were pulled.
We're grounded.

923
01:20:57,309 --> 01:20:58,344
Why?

924
01:20:58,410 --> 01:21:00,080
Some Army troops
in contact.

925
01:21:00,145 --> 01:21:01,748
They took
our gunship support.

926
01:21:02,214 --> 01:21:04,418
Can you put us on the ground
without the Apaches?

927
01:21:04,683 --> 01:21:05,786
We'll do what we have
to do to get you

928
01:21:05,851 --> 01:21:07,020
on the ground
with your men.

929
01:21:07,386 --> 01:21:08,722
Thank you.

930
01:21:08,955 --> 01:21:12,161
Bruno 65, continue 030,
we're still a go.

931
01:21:12,559 --> 01:21:13,727
Roger, 65.

932
01:21:13,793 --> 01:21:14,961
We're on our own.
Stay tight.

933
01:21:17,162 --> 01:21:18,432
Axe?

934
01:21:27,173 --> 01:21:28,442
Axe?

935
01:21:47,495 --> 01:21:48,763
Commander, we're two mikes out.

936
01:21:48,829 --> 01:21:50,332
Get your men ready.
Uh-huh. Uh, roger that.

937
01:21:50,598 --> 01:21:52,535
Two mikes! Two mikes!

938
01:21:53,901 --> 01:21:55,237
Marcus!

939
01:21:55,703 --> 01:21:57,039
Marcus!

940
01:22:11,887 --> 01:22:13,122
Yeah!

941
01:22:15,290 --> 01:22:16,860
Bruno 64, two mikes out. Go!

942
01:22:17,126 --> 01:22:19,296
Gonna be a fast infil.
Establish overwatch.

943
01:22:22,731 --> 01:22:24,302
Rope deployed
and on the ground.

944
01:22:24,367 --> 01:22:25,836
Whoo! Axe!

945
01:22:29,805 --> 01:22:30,973
Fast infil now.

946
01:22:31,041 --> 01:22:34,414
Let's do this! Patton!
You're first! Move!

947
01:22:34,477 --> 01:22:35,679
First team member
on the rope.

948
01:22:38,381 --> 01:22:39,483
You good?

949
01:22:39,716 --> 01:22:41,351
Couldn't be more good!

950
01:22:45,556 --> 01:22:46,891
RPG! Fuck!

951
01:22:54,264 --> 01:22:55,333
No.

952
01:22:55,499 --> 01:22:57,436
Fuck, throttle's off
throttle's oFF!

953
01:22:57,501 --> 01:22:59,438
Oh, shit, throttle's off!

954
01:22:59,503 --> 01:23:02,075
Brace for impact!
Brace for impact!

955
01:23:09,013 --> 01:23:10,181
Fucking down!

956
01:23:10,248 --> 01:23:12,619
Mayday, mayday!
Bruno 64 is down.

957
01:23:12,684 --> 01:23:14,187
Duck!

958
01:23:15,853 --> 01:23:17,856
Put us down!
Put us the fuck down!

959
01:23:20,092 --> 01:23:21,727
Put this fucking
helicopter down!

960
01:23:21,793 --> 01:23:23,163
Stand the fuck down,
Lieutenant.

961
01:23:24,029 --> 01:23:25,097
Wait!

962
01:23:27,332 --> 01:23:28,635
Don't you fucking stop!
Come on!

963
01:23:28,701 --> 01:23:30,871
Stand down, Lieutenant.
We're not going down there.

964
01:23:30,936 --> 01:23:32,339
Keep fucking firing!

965
01:23:32,405 --> 01:23:33,640
We have a fallen angel.

966
01:23:33,706 --> 01:23:36,144
64 is down hard.
Broke up on impact.

967
01:23:36,209 --> 01:23:38,079
LZ is too hot.
We have to break contact.

968
01:23:40,046 --> 01:23:41,214
No...

969
01:23:41,680 --> 01:23:45,087
No, no, fucking no.

970
01:23:45,317 --> 01:23:46,553
Ah!

971
01:26:18,578 --> 01:26:22,485
Razor 11 en route to crash site,
five mikes out, rejoining QRf.

972
01:26:22,816 --> 01:26:25,821
06 copy, five mikes out.
Be advised, AO is still hot.

973
01:26:31,291 --> 01:26:32,627
Axe?

974
01:26:36,630 --> 01:26:38,100
Oh, my God.

975
01:26:41,001 --> 01:26:43,005
Fuck! Axe?

976
01:26:47,341 --> 01:26:48,677
Fuck.

977
01:27:39,996 --> 01:27:41,733
You see any movement?

978
01:27:42,166 --> 01:27:43,568
I got nothing.

979
01:27:44,401 --> 01:27:48,575
O6, 11. Infrared negative.
Movement negative.

980
01:27:48,906 --> 01:27:50,575
Copy all, 11.

981
01:27:50,908 --> 01:27:54,749
06, we just hit fuel reserve.
We need to come oFF-station.

982
01:27:55,078 --> 01:27:56,749
11 returning to base.

983
01:27:57,080 --> 01:27:58,584
Roger. Copy all.

984
01:29:16,697 --> 01:29:18,033
Oh, fuck.

985
01:29:56,205 --> 01:29:57,474
Fuck.

986
01:31:06,312 --> 01:31:07,514
Fuck.

987
01:32:28,297 --> 01:32:30,568
No. No.

988
01:32:32,402 --> 01:32:34,138
Stay back!
Stay the fuck back!

989
01:32:34,804 --> 01:32:35,805
Back up!

990
01:32:36,273 --> 01:32:37,608
Stay back.

991
01:32:40,043 --> 01:32:41,880
I don't care.
I fucking...

992
01:32:55,225 --> 01:32:57,797
What the fuck is this?
Oh, fuck.

993
01:33:01,199 --> 01:33:02,834
I got this.

994
01:33:44,244 --> 01:33:46,448
No. No. No.

995
01:34:09,937 --> 01:34:10,938
What?

996
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:15,811
You... You know where
to find Americans?

997
01:34:15,877 --> 01:34:17,512
Americayee.

998
01:34:23,117 --> 01:34:24,720
Show... Show me
where we are.

999
01:34:32,327 --> 01:34:33,395
Are you sure?
Yes.

1000
01:34:45,741 --> 01:34:46,809
Who's that?

1001
01:34:49,578 --> 01:34:51,748
Who's that?
Who is that?

1002
01:34:51,814 --> 01:34:54,186
Who is that? Who is that? Who is that?

1003
01:34:54,250 --> 01:34:57,289

I will fucking kill you. I

1007
01:35:07,464 --> 01:35:08,999
I know he fucking
knows something.

1008
01:35:09,065 --> 01:35:11,637
You tell him I will
fucking kill him.

1009
01:35:12,202 --> 01:35:13,604
Look at me
in my fuckin' eyes

1010
01:35:13,670 --> 01:35:16,208
and you ask me
ifyou think I give a fuck!

1011
01:35:16,273 --> 01:35:18,610
I don't care. I don't go
home, you don't go home.

1012
01:35:18,675 --> 01:35:19,710
You hear me?

01:35:28,085 --> 01:35:29,253
Do you help me?

1016

Can I trust you?

1017
01:35:32,222 --> 01:35:33,558
Americayee.

1018
01:35:35,226 --> 01:35:36,394
Okay.

1019
01:35:37,795 --> 01:35:38,930
Okay.

1020
01:35:40,431 --> 01:35:43,537
There's an American base
located here. Give this to them.

1021
01:35:44,002 --> 01:35:45,805
Tell them where I am.
Tell them where I am.

1022
01:35:45,904 --> 01:35:47,206

Yeah, fuck you!

1033

01:39:16,023 --> 01:39:18,862
Go get me a knife.
Please? Please.

1043
01:39:37,979 --> 01:39:40,284
No, I... I said a knife.
That's not a knife.

1044
01:39:40,949 --> 01:39:42,051
Knife.

1045
01:39:42,317 --> 01:39:44,889
No. It's not a knife.

01:39:52,628 --> 01:39:53,797
I need a knife.

1050
01:39:54,830 --> 01:39:56,601
A knife...
You know, a knife?

1051
01:39:56,666 --> 01:39:57,868
Chaku.

1052
01:40:04,039 --> 01:40:05,243
Chaku?

Fuck.

1058
01:44:20,909 --> 01:44:22,244
Americayee?

1060
01:44:25,980 --> 01:44:27,382
Americayee?

1061
01:44:28,382 --> 01:44:30,553
Yes, Texas.
America is Texas, yes.

1062
01:44:31,019 --> 01:44:32,020
Tex.

1063

Update ready to follow.

1123
01:50:52,851 --> 01:50:56,023
Braye men haye fought and died
building the proud tradition

1124
01:50:56,087 --> 01:50:59,360
and fear of reputation
that I am bound to uphold.

1125
01:51:08,033 --> 01:51:10,204
I died up on that mountain.

1126
01:51:12,304 --> 01:51:13,807
No pulse.
Okay, start CPR.

1127
01:51:13,873 --> 01:51:15,343
One, two, three...

1128
01:51:15,942 --> 01:51:18,146
There is no question

1129
01:51:18,210 --> 01:51:21,550
a part of me will forever be
up on that mountain, dead...

1130
01:51:21,747 --> 01:51:23,685
As my brothers died.

1131
01:51:24,851 --> 01:51:28,625
But there is a part of me that
lived because of my brothers.

1132
01:51:29,389 --> 01:51:31,559
Because of them,
I am still alive.

1133
01:51:31,892 --> 01:51:35,466
And I can never forget that
no matter how much it hurts,

1134
01:51:35,529 --> 01:51:38,601
how dark it gets,
or how far you fall...

1135
01:51:40,233 --> 01:51:42,371
Hey, Luttrell. Luttrell!

1136
01:51:49,510 --> 01:51:50,980
We got a pulse.

1137
01:51:51,245 --> 01:51:53,750
...you are never
out of the fight.

1138
01:51:56,740 --> 01:52:01,323
Sync, fix: titler
