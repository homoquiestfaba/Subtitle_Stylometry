00:16:04,039 --> 00:16:08,218
[Mimicking Claire] Silvana, drive me
to the drug dealer.

177
00:16:08,261 --> 00:16:09,930
I said, be quiet.

178
00:16:09,973 --> 00:16:12,967
She doesn't pay you enough to put up
with her shit, ma.

179
00:16:14,175 --> 00:16:16,676
If I were you I would just quit.

180
00:16:18,244 --> 00:16:21,525
But you're not me, alright?

181
00:16:23,498 --> 00:16:25,498
Can I make you something to eat.

182
00:16:25,541 --> 00:16:28,673
No, my stomach is bothering me.
I don't feel so good.

183
00:16:29,352 --> 00:16:31,836
It's that bitches fault.

184
00:16:32,047 --> 00:16:34,414
I told you to be quiet.

185
00:16:34,872 --> 00:16:37,315
So pretty with such an ugly mouth...

186
00:16:37,358 --> 00:16:39,358
It's true.

187
00:17:08,077 --> 00:17:10,062
Fuck.

188
00:17:20,331 --> 00:17:23,948
[Claire moaning]

189
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:35,470
[Loud knocking on door]

190
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:39,099
Arturo, go away.

191
00:17:40,133 --> 00:17:41,789
[Knocking continues]

192
00:17:41,979 --> 00:17:44,265
I said go away!

193
00:17:44,541 --> 00:17:46,846
[Knocking continues loudly and slower]

194
00:18:19,654 --> 00:18:24,183
- What the fuck do you want?
- I could use something to drink.

195
00:18:24,306 --> 00:18:26,023
Oh god.

196
00:18:26,065 --> 00:18:28,065
Go away.

197
00:18:28,642 --> 00:18:30,642
Go away.

198
00:18:33,913 --> 00:18:36,473
Why are you such a cunt?!

199
00:18:38,509 --> 00:18:42,209
I hate to break it to you, but I don't
believe in ghosts.

200
00:18:42,291 --> 00:18:45,677
Ah, it doesn't really matter coward.

201
00:18:46,278 --> 00:18:48,278
I know.

202
00:18:50,681 --> 00:18:56,275
What's stopping you? You don't believe
in God...

203
00:18:56,807 --> 00:19:00,315
heaven or hell.

204
00:19:00,516 --> 00:19:02,516
You don't believe in anything.

205
00:19:06,313 --> 00:19:08,313
I know.

206
00:19:08,557 --> 00:19:10,557
What about now.

207
00:19:11,902 --> 00:19:13,442
- What?
- Just do it.

208
00:19:13,484 --> 00:19:15,031
- Stop that.
- Why don't you just do it.

209
00:19:15,073 --> 00:19:15,793
Get away from me.

210
00:19:15,835 --> 00:19:17,175
- Don't be such a coward.
- Stop it!

211
00:19:17,217 --> 00:19:19,217
No!

212
00:19:37,988 --> 00:19:40,149
- [Claire] God damn it hurts.
- [Bonnie] I understand.

213
00:19:40,195 --> 00:19:41,731
No, you obviously don't.

214
00:19:41,773 --> 00:19:45,204
C'mon, spread your hips a bit wider.

215
00:19:45,378 --> 00:19:48,315
Spin your pelvis. You feel your hip
sockets loosen?

216
00:19:48,358 --> 00:19:49,362
I can't.

217
00:19:49,404 --> 00:19:52,468
- You can.
- Jesus fucking christ!

218
00:19:53,419 --> 00:19:54,641
What are you looking at!?

219
00:19:54,684 --> 00:19:55,796
Hey!

220
00:19:55,838 --> 00:19:57,490
- You have to focus.
- I am focused.

221
00:19:57,532 --> 00:20:00,255
- No, no you're not.
- It fucking hurts.

222
00:20:00,478 --> 00:20:05,646
You've had pins in your legs for over a
year. It's gonna hurt.

223
00:20:12,254 --> 00:20:15,281
Your doctor wants me to write an
assessment.

224
00:20:15,323 --> 00:20:18,176
Ah right, c'mon. Fancy ballet moves?

225
00:20:18,218 --> 00:20:22,674
No, I'm worried that it's been zero
improvement, in six months.

226
00:20:27,519 --> 00:20:30,585
I have shown up to every fucking appointment.

227
00:20:30,628 --> 00:20:35,365
Well maybe you would do better with
a... someone else.

228
00:20:35,842 --> 00:20:37,842
Oh, okay.

229
00:22:47,818 --> 00:22:52,732
- [Silvana] Where now?
- South on the 110.

230
00:22:52,932 --> 00:22:56,828
- Tell me when you get near the 105.
- Okay.

231
00:23:13,219 --> 00:23:16,549
[Road worker] So I was on break and
I was looking like this, and...

232
00:23:16,620 --> 00:23:20,205
all of a sudden I see a lady climb
up on the ledge...

233
00:23:20,406 --> 00:23:22,738
and I'm like, oh fuck, she bout to jump.

234
00:23:22,793 --> 00:23:24,730
What did you do?

235
00:23:24,897 --> 00:23:28,006
I started yelling at her and I was like,
"don't jump, don't jump".

236
00:23:28,049 --> 00:23:30,264
And I guess she couldn't hear me...

237
00:23:30,394 --> 00:23:31,850
cause it was so far.

238
00:23:31,892 --> 00:23:35,326
Well how long before she jumped?

239
00:23:35,671 --> 00:23:38,005
It was... it was a pretty long time.

240
00:23:38,048 --> 00:23:40,607
Was it a few minutes before she jumped?

241
00:23:41,380 --> 00:23:43,380
Maybe.

242
00:23:45,092 --> 00:23:47,234
She wasn't 100 percent certain.

243
00:23:48,610 --> 00:23:52,709
Well I wouldn't say that cause... cause
she did it and...

244
00:23:52,874 --> 00:23:55,382
she was 100 percent successful.

245
00:23:55,436 --> 00:23:57,436
Right.

246
00:23:58,130 --> 00:24:00,034
[Worker] Oh look, I gotta go back
to work, okay?

247
00:24:00,076 --> 00:24:01,965
Do we... oh, okay.

248
00:24:02,007 --> 00:24:05,194
So, was she a really good friend of yours?

249
00:24:05,529 --> 00:24:07,808
Yeah... yeah.

250
00:24:08,029 --> 00:24:11,016
- Sorry to hear that.
- Yeah.

251
00:24:12,761 --> 00:24:13,907
What?!

252
00:24:13,950 --> 00:24:14,587
[Horns blaring]

253
00:24:14,630 --> 00:24:17,525
[Claire] Okay you guys, I just wanna
take a look.

254
00:24:17,634 --> 00:24:19,936
Come back. It's not safe.

255
00:24:19,979 --> 00:24:22,571
Silvana, just stay with the car.

256
00:24:22,698 --> 00:24:25,767
- It's not safe.
- It's okay.

257
00:24:26,831 --> 00:24:28,831
Come back!

258
00:25:31,485 --> 00:25:33,938
[Claire gasps]

259
00:25:35,203 --> 00:25:36,726
Oh.

260
00:25:49,352 --> 00:25:54,194
- Well, hello Claire. How are we doing?
- Oh we're doing great!

261
00:25:54,342 --> 00:25:59,982
Well, that's super. Did you find a
new support group?

262
00:26:00,025 --> 00:26:01,931
Oh it's funny you brought that up.

263
00:26:01,973 --> 00:26:05,510
I've actually decided to sue the
support group.

264
00:26:05,752 --> 00:26:06,734
Goodness.

265
00:26:06,776 --> 00:26:09,144
I mean technically I'm not suing
the support group...

266
00:26:09,229 --> 00:26:12,010
but... Los Angeles County cause
they oversee...

267
00:26:12,150 --> 00:26:15,927
the community center that sponsors
the group.

268
00:26:16,165 --> 00:26:16,736
Well..

269
00:26:16,779 --> 00:26:20,831
It's an interesting little case a few years
ago, I thought you would have heard of it.

270
00:26:20,873 --> 00:26:24,920
McDonald vs. City of Glendale, where it
was ruled that support groups could...

271
00:26:25,297 --> 00:26:28,594
"Discriminate on the basis of membership..."

272
00:26:28,735 --> 00:26:32,195
"but not when said discrimination was
legally prohibited..."

273
00:26:32,318 --> 00:26:36,430
"i.e. race, or religion or when it
involved...

274
00:26:36,485 --> 00:26:41,722
"intangible or subjective personality
traits."

275
00:26:42,346 --> 00:26:44,997
I.E. Claire's a raving bitch.

276
00:26:46,206 --> 00:26:49,255
Well but, but a lawsuit...

277
00:26:49,298 --> 00:26:51,883
I'm kidding.

278
00:26:52,329 --> 00:26:55,141
I just came here for Nina's address.

279
00:26:56,126 --> 00:26:57,983
Nina from group?

280
00:26:58,151 --> 00:27:00,870
The one who killed herself? Yeah
that Nina.

281
00:27:01,273 --> 00:27:05,208
Well I'm certain I can't give you
that information, I'm sorry.

282
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:08,285
Remember when I said I was kidding
about the lawsuit?

283
00:27:08,571 --> 00:27:12,693
- Uh huh.
- Now I'm not.

284
00:27:25,776 --> 00:27:27,776
- Hi.
- Hey.

285
00:27:28,062 --> 00:27:31,412
- I'm Claire.
- Hi, Claire.

286
00:27:32,941 --> 00:27:36,490
I lived in this house when I was
a little girl.

287
00:27:36,564 --> 00:27:39,981
- Oh.
- That probably sounded very strange.

288
00:27:41,086 --> 00:27:42,388
No.

289
00:27:42,430 --> 00:27:45,146
Well I was wondering if I could
take a look...

290
00:27:45,512 --> 00:27:50,414
but... seems like that would be a bad
idea, now that I'm standing here.

291
00:27:50,457 --> 00:27:52,539
Sure, come in.

292
00:27:52,582 --> 00:27:54,707
- May I.
- Sure it's a bit of a mess.

293
00:27:54,750 --> 00:27:57,302
You know, but uh...

294
00:28:00,030 --> 00:28:03,540
I uh, I'm trying some things.

295
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:07,371
- Right.
- We knocked out the whole kitchen.

296
00:28:07,838 --> 00:28:09,382
Right, wow...

297
00:28:09,425 --> 00:28:14,220
- Now we can dine in there.
- Hmm, I'll bet.

298
00:28:16,857 --> 00:28:19,285
Uh, could I take a look upstairs?

299
00:28:22,166 --> 00:28:24,154
Yeah, sure.

300
00:28:24,196 --> 00:28:26,196
Okay.

301
00:28:26,540 --> 00:28:30,694
So I'm guessing that this was
your room?

302
00:28:32,425 --> 00:28:34,454
Yeah.

303
00:28:35,642 --> 00:28:38,853
I didn't have the Sponge Bob mural
in those days.

304
00:28:39,261 --> 00:28:43,706
- I guess not. - I was more
purples and pinks and...

305
00:28:44,537 --> 00:28:45,841
And what else?

306
00:28:46,273 --> 00:28:53,349
Ah, let's see, my mom painted a scene
from the Nutcracker Suite on the wall.

307
00:28:53,922 --> 00:28:58,779
- What scene?
- The one with the mice.

308
00:29:01,111 --> 00:29:03,608
- How old is um...
- Casey.

309
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:04,757
- Casey's...
- Five.

310
00:29:04,800 --> 00:29:06,994
Five, that's a handful, huh?

311
00:29:07,037 --> 00:29:09,448
[Laughs] Yeah.

312
00:29:10,623 --> 00:29:15,466
He uh, he sleeps at my mum's cause
he has nightmares.

313
00:29:17,290 --> 00:29:19,282
That's too bad.

314
00:29:21,114 --> 00:29:22,970
- Okay?
- Uh huh.

315
00:29:23,021 --> 00:29:24,990
[Roy starts slowly down stairs]

316
00:29:25,043 --> 00:29:27,746
[Roy runs back up stairs]

317
00:29:29,694 --> 00:29:34,233
Yeah, this is still the same.

318
00:29:34,738 --> 00:29:36,769
We didn't do anything to the bedroom.

319
00:29:38,070 --> 00:29:40,122
We were gonna but we didn't.

320
00:29:40,406 --> 00:29:43,566
Kind of lost track, you know.

321
00:29:48,651 --> 00:29:50,651
I should go.

322
00:29:51,832 --> 00:29:54,598
- Well thank you, again.
- Uh huh.

323
00:29:55,003 --> 00:29:56,604
And...

324
00:29:56,746 --> 00:30:00,911
- Well it was interesting.
- Well I'm glad.

325
00:30:01,566 --> 00:30:03,771
Yeah your performance was impressive.

326
00:30:03,814 --> 00:30:06,234
We didn't do a damn thing to
this house.

327
00:30:06,405 --> 00:30:10,848
- So...
- Annette, she called me after you left her.

328
00:30:11,716 --> 00:30:13,782
Did you really threaten her?

329
00:30:16,477 --> 00:30:17,953
Yes.

330
00:30:20,416 --> 00:30:22,416
Why?

331
00:30:24,210 --> 00:30:29,095
I don't know. Honestly... I don't know.

332
00:30:30,414 --> 00:30:32,676
You and Nina never even talked about it.

333
00:30:32,757 --> 00:30:34,280
Why did you let me go on like that?

334
00:30:34,404 --> 00:30:38,643
I don't know. Just wanted to see how
far you'd go with it.

335
00:30:39,528 --> 00:30:42,633
- I'm sorry.
- Don't be sorry, that's fine.

336
00:30:42,675 --> 00:30:44,675
I enjoyed myself.

337
00:30:46,531 --> 00:30:49,841
- That's fucked up.
- So are you.

338
00:31:10,218 --> 00:31:13,302
Uh... I wanna go to Tijuana tomorrow.

339
00:31:14,151 --> 00:31:17,989
- Why?
- To that pharmacy I was asking you about.

340
00:31:19,781 --> 00:31:23,443
- Not a good idea.
- You have a green card, right?

341
00:31:23,485 --> 00:31:25,485
Yes.

342
00:31:26,149 --> 00:31:30,377
- But no drive...
- Silvana if you don't wanna go, I'll just hire someone.

343
00:31:30,716 --> 00:31:32,837
Okay, I'll try.

344
00:31:36,894 --> 00:31:40,808
- Are we in Orange Country yet?
- I don't know.

345
00:31:41,537 --> 00:31:43,688
Do you only see white people?

346
00:31:44,239 --> 00:31:45,520
I don't know, maybe.

347
00:31:45,562 --> 00:31:47,252
That means fucking Orange County.

348
00:31:47,295 --> 00:31:49,295
Pretty houses.

349
00:31:50,314 --> 00:31:53,500
Ah I hated trials in Orange County.

350
00:31:53,607 --> 00:31:57,256
A. you assume that everyone's a
fucking retard...

351
00:31:57,299 --> 00:32:01,939
or B. you have to assume that everyone is
a fucking right wing Nazi sympathizer.

352
00:32:02,282 --> 00:32:06,246
Hey I'm Claire the ACLU defense attorney.

353
00:32:06,289 --> 00:32:11,110
Please don't hold that against my client
and sentence him to death for shoplifting.

354
00:32:12,484 --> 00:32:13,308
Okay.

355
00:32:13,351 --> 00:32:16,519
And don't get me started on that
fucking Nixon library.

356
00:32:16,562 --> 00:32:18,979
Did you take your medicine today?

357
00:32:20,592 --> 00:32:25,077
Would we be driving to Tijuana if I took
my fucking medicine today?!

358
00:32:25,139 --> 00:32:29,460
[Upbeat Spanish music playing]

359
00:33:00,331 --> 00:33:02,949
- Alright so how does this work?
- Don't worry, I speak English.

360
00:33:02,992 --> 00:33:04,852
Oh great, okay.

361
00:33:04,894 --> 00:33:06,894
- What do you need?
- I made a list.

362
00:33:07,149 --> 00:33:11,181
And then I checked on the internet to see
if they were available in Mexico.

363
00:33:14,495 --> 00:33:18,995
It's a lot. Trying to sedate a small city?

364
00:33:24,381 --> 00:33:28,158
- This is a very good soap. I need it at home.
- Get it, get it.

365
00:33:31,337 --> 00:33:36,236
- Do you have prescriptions?
- I thought we didn't need prescriptions!

366
00:33:36,439 --> 00:33:40,516
Well at the border, unless you have
prescriptions, they will take them away.

367
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:41,822
Okay, so what do we do?

368
00:33:41,985 --> 00:33:43,671
What do we do?!

369
00:33:51,840 --> 00:33:54,326
We open up Mary...

370
00:33:54,475 --> 00:33:57,905
That's very tricky. What if we get caught?

371
00:33:57,947 --> 00:34:00,989
You're a rich white woman. Have you ever
been caught at anything?!

372
00:34:02,802 --> 00:34:05,230
Will you just get me something
other than Mary?!

373
00:34:05,272 --> 00:34:07,757
I have problems with anything religious.

374
00:34:08,166 --> 00:34:10,515
I think you have bigger problems.

375
00:34:11,052 --> 00:34:13,377
Perceptive.

376
00:34:18,097 --> 00:34:20,097
Ah, that's the one.

377
00:34:20,738 --> 00:34:24,242
What was your favorite restaurant
when you lived here?

378
00:34:24,360 --> 00:34:27,120
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah.

379
00:34:27,162 --> 00:34:28,802
I am hungry.

380
00:34:28,845 --> 00:34:33,705
I knew a very good place, but
it's not cheap.

381
00:34:33,750 --> 00:34:39,484
- Sky’s the limit. C'mon. Let's go.
- Okay.

382
00:34:40,006 --> 00:34:43,987
- Who's this guy again?
- San Judas Tadeo.

383
00:34:44,029 --> 00:34:45,907
Saint Jude.

384
00:34:46,285 --> 00:34:50,026
The saint patron of lost and
desperate causes.

385
00:34:50,266 --> 00:34:52,266
Perfect.

386
00:34:55,427 --> 00:34:57,376
- What?
- Silvana?

387
00:34:58,016 --> 00:35:00,126
Ay Chatita...

388
00:35:00,190 --> 00:35:02,675
What a surprise! How are you?

389
00:35:02,772 --> 00:35:05,483
Very good. What a miracle!

390
00:35:05,729 --> 00:35:07,862
This is Mrs. Bennet.

391
00:35:07,862 --> 00:35:13,201
- My friends Irma and Innocencia.
- Oh, nice to meet you.

392
00:35:13,279 --> 00:35:14,982
Delighted.

393
00:35:15,807 --> 00:35:18,674
Chatita, I heard a rumor...

394
00:35:18,717 --> 00:35:21,064
that Nuncio can't find a job.

395
00:35:21,347 --> 00:35:25,167
No, my husband has a job.

396
00:35:25,293 --> 00:35:26,932
Is that right?

397
00:35:26,975 --> 00:35:28,597
Yes, of course. He has a great job.

398
00:35:28,710 --> 00:35:31,765
He's building pools. Really big pools.

399
00:35:32,318 --> 00:35:33,827
- Really?
- Yes, really nice ones.

400
00:35:33,870 --> 00:35:35,124
I'll be right back.

401
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:37,050
How is Christina?

402
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,668
My daughter is doing really
well, thank you.

403
00:35:38,711 --> 00:35:42,675
She was always so beautiful.
Did she finally get married?

404
00:35:44,673 --> 00:35:48,875
No, she's not married yet...
She is a nurse.

405
00:35:48,918 --> 00:35:50,569
That's what happens in America.

406
00:35:50,612 --> 00:35:55,815
Silvana do you wanna go shopping more
or do I have to get you home?

407
00:35:56,697 --> 00:35:58,712
- Shopping.
- Yeah? Okay great.

408
00:35:58,755 --> 00:36:00,776
Excuse me.
Your change senora.

409
00:36:00,905 --> 00:36:04,567
Silvana, thank you for lunch.
It was just wonderful.

410
00:36:08,403 --> 00:36:10,987
Very nice to meet you ladies.

411
00:36:11,371 --> 00:36:15,380
Well, ladies. It was good to
see you.

412
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:19,348
Maybe we'll see each other
again soon.

413
00:36:19,396 --> 00:36:22,193
Goodbye Chatitas.
All the best.

414
00:36:29,808 --> 00:36:32,540
I was afraid you don't speak
Spanish.

415
00:36:32,583 --> 00:36:36,256
I understood a few words, but mostly
it was those bitches attitudes.

416
00:36:39,234 --> 00:36:41,234
- Thank you.
- De Nada [You're welcome].

417
00:36:42,612 --> 00:36:47,360
They are friends when I was young,
you know. Now they're not my friends.

418
00:36:48,493 --> 00:36:50,629
Because of money.

419
00:36:52,486 --> 00:36:55,853
- That's fucked up.
- That's life.

420
00:37:00,881 --> 00:37:04,641
- What's going on?
- Why don't you sit up.

421
00:37:05,246 --> 00:37:07,854
I'd really rather not.

422
00:37:07,897 --> 00:37:09,691
But it doesn't hurt you to sit up.

423
00:37:09,776 --> 00:37:13,710
- Silvana, I don't want to.
- Maybe it's good to do now.

424
00:37:14,652 --> 00:37:16,652
Please!

425
00:37:20,976 --> 00:37:23,673
- I need you to pull over, please.
- Yes.

426
00:37:24,446 --> 00:37:26,790
Oh god. Shit!

427
00:37:36,591 --> 00:37:37,869
Can I make a phone call?

428
00:37:37,911 --> 00:37:39,636
- To who?
- My husband.

429
00:37:39,678 --> 00:37:41,808
I just wanna let him know we're
running late.

430
00:37:41,871 --> 00:37:43,015
Alright.

431
00:37:43,058 --> 00:37:45,058
Thank you.

432
00:37:51,356 --> 00:37:54,668
<i>- [On phone] Jason Bennets office.</i>
- It's Claire. Will you please put me through.

433
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:58,248
<i>- He's on another call.</i>
- This is important.

434
00:38:13,905 --> 00:38:16,536
What are you doing here?

435
00:38:16,799 --> 00:38:19,323
I wanted to make sure you got home okay.

436
00:38:19,370 --> 00:38:21,854
- You could have called.
- Well...

437
00:38:22,551 --> 00:38:27,353
Your phone always goes to voice-mail
and you never really call me back.

438
00:38:27,396 --> 00:38:28,962
Oh, right.

439
00:38:29,004 --> 00:38:30,478
Hey.

440
00:38:30,520 --> 00:38:32,687
- Silvana.
- Mr. Bennet.

441
00:38:33,898 --> 00:38:37,977
Good to see you. You look thin, you know.

442
00:38:38,019 --> 00:38:40,195
- Good to see you.
- We're okay.

443
00:38:40,237 --> 00:38:41,916
We're okay. You can leave now.

444
00:38:42,001 --> 00:38:45,562
Uh you're not gonna... I don't get
a thank you?

445
00:38:46,060 --> 00:38:49,717
Oh yes. Thank you for abusing your
position within the federal government...

446
00:38:49,760 --> 00:38:52,455
- To save your ass.
- For some stupid laundry detergent.

447
00:38:52,498 --> 00:38:55,358
And whatever you put in that statue
that they didn't find.

448
00:38:59,099 --> 00:39:01,099
Goodbye.

449
00:39:02,569 --> 00:39:04,303
Goodbye Silvana.

450
00:39:04,428 --> 00:39:06,597
Okay, goodbye Jason.

451
00:39:06,639 --> 00:39:10,762
Uh, maybe I should...get the rest of
my stuff while I'm here?

452
00:39:10,804 --> 00:39:12,661
Not tonight.

453
00:39:12,704 --> 00:39:14,704
Wouldn't be prudent.

454
00:39:17,079 --> 00:39:20,169
- You never called my assistant.
- I know, I will call her tomorrow.

455
00:39:20,212 --> 00:39:23,515
- You're lying.
- Couldn't get it past you, huh.

456
00:39:38,671 --> 00:39:41,093
That doesn't say I'm leaving.

457
00:39:42,425 --> 00:39:44,680
I'd love to know how you're doing.

458
00:40:17,840 --> 00:40:20,002
[Sobbing slightly] I've been better.

459
00:40:25,869 --> 00:40:27,869
I'm sorry.

460
00:40:35,253 --> 00:40:42,935
This is gonna sound weird and full of
all kinds of inappropriate intentions...

461
00:40:43,535 --> 00:40:45,535
I can handle it.

462
00:40:47,106 --> 00:40:49,786
And I don't wanna have sex or
anything...

463
00:40:50,391 --> 00:40:55,019
could you just stay in my room with me
until I fall asleep?

464
00:40:57,233 --> 00:40:59,233
Of course.

465
00:41:08,912 --> 00:41:10,912
That was easy.

466
00:41:20,049 --> 00:41:22,823
- There you go.
- Thank you.

467
00:41:23,343 --> 00:41:25,588
Do you want me to lie down next to you?

468
00:41:25,812 --> 00:41:30,057
- No. That's ok.
- Ok.

469
00:41:40,443 --> 00:41:42,994
Do you want me to tell you a
bedtime story?

470
00:41:44,775 --> 00:41:46,775
Yeah.

471
00:41:50,505 --> 00:41:52,844
Yeah, tell me a story.

472
00:41:53,807 --> 00:41:57,602
Where everyone’s angry at the evil witch.

473
00:41:58,909 --> 00:42:01,004
I can do that.

474
00:42:02,340 --> 00:42:03,979
Thank you.

475
00:42:05,706 --> 00:42:08,964
Once upon a time...

476
00:42:09,613 --> 00:42:15,738
<i>This lady traveled to a magical, distant
land called... Tijuana.</i>

477
00:42:30,326 --> 00:42:32,326
Jason?

[Claire sighs]

479
00:42:47,141 --> 00:42:49,008
[Door closes]

480
00:42:53,383 --> 00:42:55,383
I need a ride.

481
00:42:57,404 --> 00:43:00,724
- Just running an errand.
- Never mind.

482
00:43:15,463 --> 00:43:18,330
Thanks for not asking me why I
sit like this.

483
00:43:18,708 --> 00:43:21,043
Or why you keep turning up
at my house.

484
00:43:23,608 --> 00:43:26,508
Look, I'm not a stalker.

485
00:43:27,061 --> 00:43:30,823
- Okay.
- I mean not in the traditional sense.

486
00:43:31,096 --> 00:43:33,597
I don't care. It doesn't bother me either way.

487
00:43:35,192 --> 00:43:37,192
I like your attitude.

[Roy] Did a nice job. Real fast.

490
00:43:48,255 --> 00:43:50,672
- [Claire] Is that granite?
- Uh huh.

491
00:43:50,824 --> 00:43:52,119
Do you know where they got it?

492
00:43:52,162 --> 00:43:54,925
I'm thinking of putting a kitchen island
in my back yard.

493
00:43:55,796 --> 00:43:59,834
- Some Greek guy. I'll get you his card.
- That'd be great.

494
00:44:00,391 --> 00:44:02,391
Great.

495
00:44:05,881 --> 00:44:10,655
- She was 31.
- Yeah.

496
00:44:11,845 --> 00:44:14,419
- I never would have thought that.
- Why's that?

497
00:44:14,633 --> 00:44:16,633
She just looked younger.

498
00:44:16,839 --> 00:44:23,488
[Chimes ringing]

499
00:44:23,531 --> 00:44:26,726
- Could you uh...
- Oh yeah.

500
00:44:35,560 --> 00:44:37,779
- Give me that.
- Okay.

502
00:44:47,125 --> 00:44:50,708
- I think that's illegal.
- I don't give a shit.

503
00:45:03,151 --> 00:45:05,151
Oh great, thanks.

504
00:45:07,070 --> 00:45:11,089
- I was just in Tijuana.
- Oh, what for?

505
00:45:11,131 --> 00:45:13,297
This guy I was dating.

506
00:45:13,409 --> 00:45:16,187
He wanted to go down there and get
drunk on cheap booze...

507
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:18,826
and then watch women have sex
with donkeys.

508
00:45:23,500 --> 00:45:26,543
- I'm kidding.
- Good.

509
00:45:26,962 --> 00:45:29,912
- I was just down there for work.
- What kind of work?

510
00:45:29,988 --> 00:45:31,745
Nothing, nothing interesting.

511
00:45:31,787 --> 00:45:33,787
- Really?
- Uh huh.

512
00:45:36,137 --> 00:45:38,320
You know how my wife killed herself?

513
00:45:39,385 --> 00:45:40,980
Yes.

514
00:45:44,562 --> 00:45:46,562
Did she leave a note?

515
00:45:48,586 --> 00:45:50,112
No.

516
00:45:53,591 --> 00:45:58,183
I did this exercise in the suicide
support group where they...

517
00:45:58,225 --> 00:46:02,018
your partner pretends to be the
one who died.

518
00:46:04,958 --> 00:46:07,527
Do you want to know what I said
to my beautiful wife.

519
00:46:08,393 --> 00:46:12,399
- Yeah.

01:05:01,996 --> 01:05:04,464
- Silvana?!
- Yes?

694
01:05:04,506 --> 01:05:09,001
Can you... can you just come and help
me for a second.

695
01:05:09,043 --> 01:05:11,038
Where are you?

696
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:13,080
I'm in... oh...

697
01:05:15,983 --> 01:05:18,657
- What are you doing here?
- I need to...

698
01:05:18,926 --> 01:05:21,609
I just need to find a bathing suit
for Casey.

699
01:05:22,904 --> 01:05:24,653
- Maybe...
- I will find it.

700
01:05:25,228 --> 01:05:27,907
- I will find it.
- Thank you.

701
01:05:39,037 --> 01:05:41,037
I left my support group.

702
01:05:42,348 --> 01:05:47,863
- Oh.
- Yeah, there was just... too much anger.

703
01:05:48,080 --> 01:05:50,846
- It was tiring.
- Hmm.

704
01:05:51,078 --> 01:05:55,650
- Anger feels so good.
- It's just a drug.

705
01:05:57,301 --> 01:06:00,041
I think I'm gonna go back to work,
next week.

706
01:06:00,254 --> 01:06:03,507
- Really.
- Yeah, I gotta get out of my head.

707
01:06:03,549 --> 01:06:05,878
- They've got great drugs for that.
- Yeah.

708
01:06:06,405 --> 01:06:08,405
I think I'm gonna move too.

709
01:06:10,313 --> 01:06:15,693
- You're full of resolutions today.
- I might wanna get my hair done.

710
01:06:15,736 --> 01:06:17,736
I didn't get my hair done.

711
01:06:18,197 --> 01:06:22,657
- Why, what's wrong with my hair?
- Nothing. It's very nice.

712
01:06:30,112 --> 01:06:33,845
- Can I ask you something?
- Sure.

713
01:06:36,632 --> 01:06:38,664
How can you still live here?

714
01:06:41,095 --> 01:06:43,095
I like my house.

715
01:06:44,357 --> 01:06:50,905
Maybe, but don't you feel like you're
surrounded by ghosts?

716
01:06:51,434 --> 01:06:52,815
No... no.

717
01:06:52,857 --> 01:06:57,753
- You know what I mean. All the memories.
- Why don't you try some wine?

718
01:06:57,795 --> 01:06:59,609
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

719
01:06:59,651 --> 01:07:01,651
Okay.

720
01:07:09,895 --> 01:07:14,739
Hey, little pirate. Wanna dive for some
treasure? Okay, gold.

721
01:07:15,474 --> 01:07:17,474
Ready?

722
01:07:28,240 --> 01:07:33,068
[Sound of Roy and Casey playing
in the pool in the background]

723
01:07:40,510 --> 01:07:42,002
I think we should applaud.

724
01:07:42,072 --> 01:07:48,714
No, no, no. That's okay.. that's okay.

725
01:07:49,038 --> 01:07:54,916

- Thank you. I am too.

727

- Silvana, ignore it.
- [Silvana] One second.

728
01:07:59,891 --> 01:08:02,607
What did you used to have on the wall?

729
01:08:03,196 --> 01:08:07,869
Oh just something, I need to get something
that works better in the room.

730
01:08:08,870 --> 01:08:10,288
- [Silvana] Mrs. Bennet?
- Hmm?

731
01:08:10,331 --> 01:08:13,817
- There's a man, he asks for you.
- What's his name?

732
01:08:14,432 --> 01:08:16,494
- He not say.
- Well do you know who he is?

733
01:08:16,565 --> 01:08:18,368
- Nope.
- Well tell him to go away.

734
01:08:18,410 --> 01:08:19,924
He's probably a Jehova's witness.

735
01:08:19,966 --> 01:08:22,434
Well I did but he say he wait outside.

736
01:08:22,476 --> 01:08:25,283
Oh, Jesus Christ, I'll have to do it
myself.

737
01:08:25,325 --> 01:08:27,476
He won't say his name.

738
01:08:40,349 --> 01:08:43,716
Get off my fucking property before
I call the police.

739
01:08:43,801 --> 01:08:50,009
I'm sorry... I wish I could do something.
I can't live with myself.

740
01:08:50,437 --> 01:08:55,567
If I can switch places, I would. I wanted
to tell you that, at the trial.

741
01:08:55,680 --> 01:08:57,468
But my lawyers wouldn't let me.

742

- Please get the fuck out of here.

- Thanks.

- Wish I could say the same about you.
- No. I might go with a [??] bouquet.

761
01:13:50,495 --> 01:13:53,601
You're probably wondering about the cake.

762
01:13:53,706 --> 01:13:56,272
I didn't wanna be rude, but yes.

763
01:13:56,315 --> 01:13:58,918
Remember when Annette asked us what
our dream would be...

764
01:13:59,100 --> 01:14:00,438
if we didn't have chronic pain?

765
01:14:00,481 --> 01:14:03,251
God I always hated her drippy little
exercises.

766
01:14:03,880 --> 01:14:07,612
Yours was to have sex with the entire
Madrid soccer team.

767
01:14:10,943 --> 01:14:14,048
And yours was sickeningly sincere.

768
01:14:14,154 --> 01:14:18,829
What's wrong with a mother wanting to make
her son a birthday cake from scratch?

told mine.

I had my reasons.

- I know that now.
- I know you know.

773
01:14:39,756 --> 01:14:44,493
To be honest, I was never impressed
with the whole saint Nina thing.

774
01:14:44,903 --> 01:14:47,212
Saints don't jump off bridges.

775
01:14:47,407 --> 01:14:51,399

that applesauce?

- We went to a drive-in.
- Who?

01:16:18,064 --> 01:16:22,368
It was our first date. We were law
students at UCLA.

01:23:10,778 --> 01:23:13,764
Silvana, I'm gonna let you rant in Spanish
as long as you want...

860
01:23:13,806 --> 01:23:16,034
because I can only imagine how frustrated
you must be with me.

861
01:23:16,077 --> 01:23:17,983
I'm not frustrated, senora.

862
01:23:18,064 --> 01:23:22,143
"Frustrated" is too small a word to
describe what I'm feeling.

863
01:23:22,271 --> 01:23:25,044
I should've left you months ago,
you know.

864
01:23:25,400 --> 01:23:27,490
- Silvana.
- What?!

865
01:23:27,795 --> 01:23:29,970
We have a bigger problem.

866
01:23:33,422 --> 01:23:35,844
This is all we need!

867
01:23:36,508 --> 01:23:39,400
They said that they would bring the
rental in the morning.

868
01:23:40,419 --> 01:23:41,967
You call your family, okay.

869
01:23:42,009 --> 01:23:44,009
Okay.

870
01:23:49,539 --> 01:23:53,567
Oh, Jesus. That's not gonna happen.

871
01:23:55,858 --> 01:23:57,492
[Claire] Oh thank God.

872
01:24:07,062 --> 01:24:09,658
- [Silvana] I'll sleep in the chair.
- No.

873
01:24:10,056 --> 01:24:14,259
- Silvana no. No, please.
- I don't mind.

874
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:56,345
- Good night, Silvana.
- Buenos Noches.

875
01:25:40,484 --> 01:25:41,960
Oh!

876
01:25:42,061 --> 01:25:46,207
- Can I help you?
- No, I wasn't gonna steal anything.

877
01:25:46,332 --> 01:25:49,726
Ah, where'd you run away from?

878
01:25:51,327 --> 01:25:52,952
Boise.

879
01:25:53,031 --> 01:25:55,031
I've never been to Boise.

880
01:25:55,700 --> 01:25:58,167
- It's beautiful.
- Let me guess.

881
01:25:58,244 --> 01:26:01,192
You are on your way to LA.

882
01:26:01,706 --> 01:26:03,231
Yeah!

883
01:26:15,011 --> 01:26:18,246
So what happened? Was it gory?

884
01:26:19,557 --> 01:26:24,349
My parachute failed to open and I fell
ten thousand feet to the ground.

885
01:26:25,764 --> 01:26:28,817
- Did not.
- Did too.

886
01:26:30,203 --> 01:26:33,510
- What's in LA?
- I'm gonna be an actress.

887
01:26:34,507 --> 01:26:38,150
Yeah, that's a sad story.

888
01:26:39,587 --> 01:26:41,914
I hate to tell you but you're gonna end
up in porn...

889
01:26:42,440 --> 01:26:45,022
cause that's what happens to girls
from Idaho.

890
01:26:45,065 --> 01:26:47,007
Gross. I won't do porn!

891
01:26:47,050 --> 01:26:50,031
Yes, this is what happens to bad girls.

892
01:26:51,154 --> 01:26:53,984
I'm just trying to help you avoid some
of the many mistakes...

893
01:26:54,027 --> 01:26:56,554
that you seem so intent on making.

894
01:26:56,761 --> 01:26:58,873
Where you always such a fucking shrew.

895
01:26:58,936 --> 01:27:00,592
[Claire laughs]

896
01:27:00,635 --> 01:27:04,642
Oh, someone took a Shakespeare class.

897
01:27:20,192 --> 01:27:23,426
God you know what sounds so good
right now?

898
01:27:24,411 --> 01:27:29,615
A homemade yellow cake with
fudge frosting.

899
01:27:32,432 --> 01:27:34,432
Wanna make 100 bucks?

900
01:27:36,790 --> 01:27:39,814
I just want you to make me a cake.

901
01:27:41,867 --> 01:27:43,937
Sure.

902
01:27:51,677 --> 01:27:58,081
Okay, so, the kitchen... is in here.
Anything I can do to help?

903
01:27:58,413 --> 01:28:01,822
Uh, no. Stay out of my fucking way.

904
01:28:01,895 --> 01:28:03,895
Okay.

905
01:28:12,621 --> 01:28:16,350
HE BELONGS HERE.

906
01:29:41,280 --> 01:29:44,013
Yes. I'd like to speak to Jason, please.

907
01:29:46,764 --> 01:29:49,810
Yes, um, I'd like to leave a message.

908
01:29:51,039 --> 01:29:55,598
Would you just tell him, thank you
for the gift.

909
01:29:56,513 --> 01:29:58,513
Yeah.

910
01:31:18,225 --> 01:31:22,735
[Silvana] Mrs. Bennet. Mrs. Bennet.
Mrs. Bennet!

911
01:31:22,777 --> 01:31:23,795
What, what's...

912
01:31:23,837 --> 01:31:26,989
- What time is it?
- Tomorrow. The girl stole.

913
01:31:27,031 --> 01:31:30,805
She took your purse, the money on
the counter.

914
01:31:31,611 --> 01:31:33,611
Oh God.

915
01:31:34,122 --> 01:31:36,997
- You underestimate me.
- I call the police.

916
01:31:37,040 --> 01:31:39,791
Oh, no, no, no, no. It's fine. I'll
just cancel my credit cards.

917
01:31:39,834 --> 01:31:41,561
Not only, because...

918
01:31:41,645 --> 01:31:44,180
- She [??]
- She's...

919
01:31:45,091 --> 01:31:47,213
- I knew from the beginning.
- I know.

920
01:31:47,256 --> 01:31:50,679
- She was a bad girl, you know.
- She's a kid.

921
01:31:50,722 --> 01:31:53,095
- I told you.
- I know you did.

922
01:31:59,373 --> 01:32:03,213
That is homemade fudge frosting. Taste that.

923
01:32:08,753 --> 01:32:10,324
[Silvana] Hmm.

924
01:32:11,376 --> 01:32:14,765
- This thief can cook.
- Right.

925
01:32:22,562 --> 01:32:24,562
- Hey.
- Hey.

926
01:32:25,295 --> 01:32:28,537
- Is Casey here?
- He's playing at the neighbors.

927
01:32:28,640 --> 01:32:31,201
Okay. Can I come in?

928
01:32:32,347 --> 01:32:34,966
- Sure.
- Thank you.

929
01:35:53,924 --> 01:35:55,686
- Wait.
- What?

930
01:35:55,728 --> 01:35:57,728
Just give me one second.

931
01:36:11,250 --> 01:36:15,543
All right. Never mind.

932
01:36:21,784 --> 01:36:24,003
[Car starts]

933
01:36:34,995 --> 01:36:37,058
[Exhales]
