1
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:15,280
Okay, ladies, move out.

2
00:00:19,120 --> 00:00:20,080
Follow me.

3
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:25,920
Come on, Amy, let's go.

4
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,880
Let's ditch.

5
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:27,600
Okay.

6
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,800
Where did you get those?

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,280
My mom's purse.

8
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:34,880
You are so busted.

9
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:36,200
She won't know the difference.

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,480
She doesn't even
know I'm here today.

11
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:39,280
Come on, hurry up.

12
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:44,480
Dork.

13
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:45,480
Shut up.

14
00:00:57,640 --> 00:00:59,680
Well, we've got a Jane Doe.

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:02,280
I guess she could
be a runaway.

16
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,320
She's not a street kid.
Not with these nails.

17
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:06,320
Hit-and-run?

18
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,960
I don't think so. She's too far from
the road to be tossed by a car.

19
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,320
Looks like she's been hit by every
bug in South Florida, though.

20
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,720
Poor baby's been eaten alive.

21
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,400
Smells like beer.

22
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:20,880
You are much too young
to be out drinking, sweetheart.

23
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:23,880
Maybe the poor thing was
just coming home from a party.

24
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:27,480
She hasn't been here that long.
Check her lividity.

25
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:32,320
I've got double-lividity.

26
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,320
Her blood settled twice.
She's been moved.

27
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,360
Then it's a body dump.

28
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,360
So we are in search
of a crime scene.

29
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:18,600
1x11 Camp Fear

30
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,040
Calleigh, please.

31
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:29,040
Coming.

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:35,480
Hmm ...

33
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:38,480
What do you think of this?

34
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:42,280
Okay, well ...

35
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,960
faint tread impression, knobby tire,
narrow track width.

36
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:48,080
Put it all together, it spells ATV.

37
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:50,160
Pretty fragile, though.
You think you can cast them?

38
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:53,560
Hair spray.

39
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:54,960
I like it.

40
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,880
Detective Delacroix says
guy's a wharf rat.

41
00:03:09,880 --> 00:03:11,240
So do we have a name on him?

42
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:12,880
Willie Stango.

43
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,800
His ex-wife came by this
morning to check up on him.

44
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,040
Said he'd been ducking
her calls for a week.

45
00:03:18,040 --> 00:03:19,080
Ugh.

46
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:21,760
Okay, that's bad.

47
00:03:25,600 --> 00:03:27,800
Oh, god, it smells well done.

48
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:28,800
Well done.

49
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,880
Oh, yeah. That looks like
someone torched him.

50
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:43,880
No signs of forced entry.

51
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:46,320
Probably someone he knew.

52
00:03:47,160 --> 00:03:48,480
Like a bitter ex-wife?

53
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:54,560
Got milk?

54
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:57,760
It's all over the place.

55
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:13,400
A cell phone.

56
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:14,800
It's still working.

57
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:20,600
Lots of missed calls.

58
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,200
That's a good place to start.

59
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:25,440
Liver temp says she died between
three and five this morning.

60
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,080
Welts on her body appear
to be insect bites:

61
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:30,880
ants, mosquitoes,
god knows what else.

62
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,880
Blunt force trauma to the right aspect
of the forehead an inch from the midline.

63
00:04:36,640 --> 00:04:40,480
Blood loss could've led to endotoxic
shock but I'll have to do more testing.

64
00:04:40,480 --> 00:04:43,120
Okay, so somebody hit
her and dumped her.

65
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,640
The cause of death is still uncertain.
Could've been an accident.

66
00:04:45,640 --> 00:04:49,320
Teenage girl doesn't wind up by the side
of the road dead and it'd be an accident.

67
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:50,520
What about sexual assault?

68
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:53,520
Minor vaginal tearing
around the opening.

69
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,120
And this.

70
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:57,080
Diaphragm.

71
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:00,640
Fifteen years old and she 
was planning on having sex.

72
00:05:00,640 --> 00:05:01,640
Or someone was.

73
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,640
Maybe someone who
didn't get their way.

74
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:07,440
Here's the tox you wanted.

75
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,240
Oh, okay.
Cool room.

76
00:05:12,920 --> 00:05:14,320
Ruben, have you
seen Megan?

77
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:15,760
She had court today.

78
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:19,440
I thought she had
court yesterday.

79
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:22,760
She stopped by,
told me to give you this.

80
00:05:28,480 --> 00:05:31,520
Uh, your Jane Doe's blood
alcohol was 0.0.

81
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:32,400
What?

82
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,400
So she smelled of beer but
didn't drink any? Okay, that's odd.

83
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:38,640
Not as odd as this --her pro-time's
up to about 25 seconds.

84
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:41,440
Her blood wasn't clotting?

85
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:43,360
Well, she could've been
taking a blood thinner.

86
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:44,160
I'm still running more tests.

87
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,160
No, a blood thinner would've
caused extensive bruising.

88
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:49,560
Especially with her injuries. 
And there's not a bruise on her.

89
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:52,920
We've got no ID, no primary crime
scene and no cause of death, right?

90
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,400
Pretty much sums it up.

91
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:58,400
Well, we know she was doing
one thing before she passed away.

92
00:05:58,520 --> 00:05:59,720
She was breathing.

93
00:05:59,720 --> 00:06:02,240
Yes, breathing air filled
with contaminants.

94
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:05,040
I'll swab her nasal passages
and sinus cavities.

95
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,760
Okay. Keep me posted.

96
00:06:24,040 --> 00:06:28,160
Tread marks are from DTP
mud gator's quad-claw design.

97
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,040
Standard issue on
650 series ATVs.

98
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,320
Got some nice
scuffing on the outside ribs.

99
00:06:33,320 --> 00:06:36,520
Nice work. I've got a standard
issue situation here, too.

100
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,840
I think it's some
type of, uh ...

101
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:41,960
uniform.

102
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,000
It's a laundry mark used to separate
identical quantities of clothing.

103
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,000
An invisible laundry mark,

104
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:51,320
just like our Jane Doe who's not been
reported missing yet, has she?

105
00:06:51,480 --> 00:06:55,300
Detective Sevilla has blanketed all
the local agencies with her pictures,

106
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,000
but no hits yet.

107
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,040
Okay.

108
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:00,320
By the way ...

109
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:02,640
a present for you from Alexx.

110
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:05,800
Nasal mucus.

111
00:07:06,320 --> 00:07:08,040
And it isn't even my birthday.

112
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:09,040
Sorry about that.

113
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:13,960
Hey.
Hey.

114
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:16,320
You mind if I observe?

115
00:07:16,320 --> 00:07:17,920
When have I ever?

116
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,520
So, Mr. Observer,
what do you see?

117
00:07:28,640 --> 00:07:31,520
Uh, partial thickness burns ...

118
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:35,800
... of the lips, tongue
and oral mucosa.

119
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,160
Stomach lining appears
to be red and inflamed.

120
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:41,680
What about the lungs?

121
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,840
Swelling of the main stem bronchi.
Release of edema fluid.

122
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:49,720
Meaning?

123
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:52,760
Meaning he was
fried from the inside.

124
00:07:52,760 --> 00:07:56,760
And the heat from the burns
blocked off his airway.

125
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,800
Not bad, not bad at all.

126
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:04,200
You know, Speed, anytime you want
to cross over to our side of the street ...

127
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:06,360
Do you have any idea
what could've caused it?

128
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:08,120
No. We're running tox.

129
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,120
But if you want first dibs 
on the stomach lining...

130
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,120
Well, yeah.

131
00:08:20,680 --> 00:08:23,560
Great thing about the
nose is it acts like a filter.

132
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:25,160
Everything we breathe gets 
trapped inside --

133
00:08:25,160 --> 00:08:27,760
spores, dirt, live dust mites ...

134
00:08:27,760 --> 00:08:30,640
Ugh. Remind me
never to breathe again.

135
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:32,760
Bingo.
That's pollen.

136
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:39,880
Excuse me.

137
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:42,240
You get something
on the laundry mark?

138
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:43,960
Yes, Pharos Academy...

139
00:08:43,960 --> 00:08:46,480
a juvenile detention camp
for girls in Southwest Dade.

140
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,680
Ah, tough love.

141
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:49,640
Parents ship their children off
when they lose control.

142
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:51,080
Last chance before
the courts get involved.

143
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:52,560
Yes, well, now we're involved.

144
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,320
At least we know what
Jane Doe was running from.

145
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:26,680
Sergeant Marcus Cawdrey, Horatio Caine, 
Calleigh Duquesne, Miami Crime Lab.

146
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:27,640
How do you do, Sergeant?

147
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:30,240
Hello.
Pleasure.

148
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,840
There's been no crime committed on
this property. I can tell you that.

149
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,240
Well, how about a couple
of miles up the road?

150
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:37,240
We found one of your girls.

151
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:41,840
Well, that's not one of my cadets.
I've never seen that girl before.

152
00:09:41,840 --> 00:09:43,440
This is not one of your girls?

153
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:44,440
No, sir.

154
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:53,840
Excuse me.

155
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:58,440
Sergeant Cawdrey, how many
ATV's do you have on this ...

156
00:09:58,440 --> 00:09:59,640
Take a look at this.

157
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:03,520
It's a match.

158
00:10:04,520 --> 00:10:07,840
It also means that we're
going to be here for a while.

159
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:18,640
I don't know how that ATV
got off property.

160
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:21,160
Access is strictly 
limited to instructors.

161
00:10:21,320 --> 00:10:23,000
What about this young
lady right over here?

162
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:25,640
Senior Cadets are
considered part of our staff.

163
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:29,360
Okay, we'll need
a list of those names.

164
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:30,720
These girls are minors.

165
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,920
I can't give you  anything
without parental permission.

166
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:35,360
Okay, we'll get it right after 
we inform their parents...

167
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:37,520
they're part of an ongoing
murder investigation.

168
00:10:37,520 --> 00:10:39,520
Now, let's talk about the
property for a minute, Sergeant.

169
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:40,960
I noticed that you
don't have a fence.

170
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:43,440
In life there are no fences.

171
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:46,160
We rely on a
strict code of discipline.

172
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:47,760
We monitor everything
these girls do.

173
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:49,640
We tell them when to eat,
sleep and shower.

174
00:10:49,640 --> 00:10:50,840
When to go to the bathroom?

175
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,720
Yes, ma'am. Extreme problems
require extreme measures.

176
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:56,720
And do those measures
ever get too extreme?

177
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,120
That can never happen.
We have safety protocols in place.

178
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,400
Do you recognize this shirt?

179
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:06,760
Looks like one of ours.

180
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:07,880
And the number?

181
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:10,720
Barracks two.

182
00:11:14,520 --> 00:11:15,240
Ladies ...

183
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,480
Sergeant on deck!

184
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:19,520
Heads down!

185
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,080
This won't be necessary,
Sergeant.

186
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:25,600
We have to earn the right to face
others with dignity and respect, sir.

187
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,160
Senior Cadet Barreiro is one
of our success stories.

188
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:32,240
She used to steal, fight and 
disrespect her parents.

189
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:35,800
Now she's planning on going to
college. Isn't that right, Senior Cadet?

190
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:37,040
Yes, Sergeant!

191
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:38,360
Congratulations, Cadet.

192
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:41,880
Now, sergeant am I to understand the
young ladies are issued uniform shirts?

193
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:43,160
Yes, sir. Three.

194
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:46,160
Three shirts. What is the significance
of the single yellow bar.

195
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:47,960
Denotes a cadet first class, sir.

196
00:11:47,960 --> 00:11:49,520
Okay, could I see them, please?

197
00:11:49,520 --> 00:11:50,320
Yes, sir.

198
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:53,320
Cadet first class,
locker inspection!

199
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,880
Cadet Julie Morales,
sir, front and center.

200
00:12:13,880 --> 00:12:16,280
Cadet Morales,
you're missing a shirt.

201
00:12:16,280 --> 00:12:17,320
Where's your third shirt?

202
00:12:17,320 --> 00:12:19,520
Sir, this Cadet does
not know, sir.

203
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,840
Okay, maybe I can be helpful.

204
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:27,560
We believe that we found the
missing shirt on this young lady.

205
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:29,160
Does she seem familiar to you?

206
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:31,920
Sir, no, sir!

207
00:12:32,600 --> 00:12:33,680
Okay.

208
00:12:33,880 --> 00:12:35,880
I'm going to go through
your locker, okay?

209
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:51,920
Is this your boyfriend?

210
00:12:54,400 --> 00:12:57,080
No, that's my brother.

211
00:12:57,080 --> 00:12:58,080
Eyes front, cadet!

212
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:16,240
Horatio.

213
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,480
Same color as Jane Doe's.

214
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:21,600
Yes, it is.

215
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:27,320
Sergeant, we're going to have
to process this whole barracks.

216
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:28,960
On what grounds?

217
00:13:28,960 --> 00:13:30,240
Bad hair day.

218
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:01,440
What have you got?

219
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:04,240
I'm not sure.

220
00:14:05,520 --> 00:14:06,640
I'm not sure about any of this.

221
00:14:06,640 --> 00:14:10,960
I hear you. Like, why would anyone
sneak into a detention camp?

222
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,320
Maybe she was desperate.

223
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,320
Is this going to take much longer?

224
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,280
My girls need to get 
back to their routine.

225
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:22,320
Actually, uh ...
actually, we are finished.

226
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:25,440
I am going to need one
other thing, though.

227
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,320
I need your belt
and your pants.

228
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:34,400
What for?

229
00:14:35,200 --> 00:14:36,720
Why don't you tell me?

230
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:48,640
Managed to extract one hundred
incomings from Willie's cell phone.

231
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:51,040
Delacroix's tracking them
through teleshore.

232
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:55,040
So, Mr. Wizard, you, uh ... any
idea yet what killed our guy?

233
00:14:55,320 --> 00:14:56,920
Yeah, he had gas.

234
00:14:58,760 --> 00:15:01,760
Gasoline to be more precise. All the
way down to his stomach lining.

235
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,760
Someone poured gas down
his throat and lit him up.

236
00:15:06,760 --> 00:15:08,840
Human molotov cocktail.

237
00:15:08,840 --> 00:15:11,840
The interesting thing about that sample is
that it has trace amounts of sodium.

238
00:15:12,080 --> 00:15:16,960
I see. Sodium and gasoline
comes from saltwater contamination.

239
00:15:16,960 --> 00:15:18,760
There's a lot of gas
around that marina.

240
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:21,160
You think Willie Stango
owned a boat?

241
00:15:21,160 --> 00:15:22,360
Could be.

242
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,080
Could be?
Could be.

243
00:15:25,080 --> 00:15:26,200
Let's go find out.

244
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:29,240
Never fumed one
of these before.

245
00:15:30,040 --> 00:15:31,280
Talk to me, guys.

246
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:34,640
Tested the diaphragm for semen.
Negative.

247
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,120
But then I thought
I spotted a partial ...

248
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:37,520
He spotted more than that.

249
00:15:37,520 --> 00:15:39,960
Jane Doe's print on
her own diaphragm.

250
00:15:39,960 --> 00:15:41,000
Hardly the crime of the century.

251
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:42,480
Not just her prints.

252
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:45,120
Plural.
Two sets.

253
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,440
Two sets?

254
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:48,720
Interesting.

255
00:16:04,040 --> 00:16:07,960
The substance on Marcus's zipper 
is definitely human blood.

256
00:16:07,960 --> 00:16:10,360
DNA is on it right now.

257
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:12,240
Well, tell them
there's more coming.

258
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,640
There's some evidence
of a wipe-down,

259
00:16:15,640 --> 00:16:18,040
but dollars to donuts
this blood's from our vic.

260
00:16:21,760 --> 00:16:24,280
Yeah, but we still don't know
where she was killed.

261
00:16:24,280 --> 00:16:25,120
Or who killed her.

262
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:26,000
That's correct.

263
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,600
You know what, swab the intake system
and the air filter. ATV's got to breathe, too.

264
00:16:30,080 --> 00:16:32,080
Yeah, Horatio.

265
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:35,720
Okay.

266
00:16:36,200 --> 00:16:38,400
Our victim's name is Dara Winters.

267
00:16:38,400 --> 00:16:41,180
Her mother just filed a missing persons
report less than two hours ago.

268
00:16:41,180 --> 00:16:42,680
She was a teen model.

269
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,160
She was so beautiful.

270
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:50,520
Yes, she was.

271
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:55,440
We were planning a trip to Milan.
It was her first time.

272
00:16:56,440 --> 00:16:58,680
When was the last time you
saw your daughter, Mrs. Winters?

273
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,440
Last night, about eight o'clock.

274
00:17:02,080 --> 00:17:03,360
She was going out
with some friends.

275
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:05,320
I'm going to need those names.

276
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:08,720
Do you remember
what she was wearing?

277
00:17:10,280 --> 00:17:15,280
A red halter top, a black miniskirt.
Actually, we argued about it.

278
00:17:15,880 --> 00:17:17,180
You had a fight?

279
00:17:20,649 --> 00:17:22,760
Why did it take you so long
to report her missing?

280
00:17:22,760 --> 00:17:25,699
Sometimes I wouldn't see 
my daughter all morning.

281
00:17:25,699 --> 00:17:29,199
But in the afternoon, I called some
of her friends then I called the police.

282
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:32,520
Did she have a
friend named Julie Morales?

283
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,160
Julie Morales?
No.

284
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:38,882
Because we believe she was
at a Juvenile Detention Camp ...

285
00:17:38,882 --> 00:17:39,960
named Pharos Academy.

286
00:17:39,960 --> 00:17:42,480
A detention camp?
Why would she be there?

287
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:44,440
I don't know.
Maybe to visit a friend.

288
00:17:44,840 --> 00:17:46,200
I don't think so.

289
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,038
Okay,

290
00:17:47,038 --> 00:17:50,300
is it possible, Mrs. Winters that you didn't
know everything about your daughter?

291
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,980
Lieutenant Caine,
do you have teenage children?

292
00:17:53,480 --> 00:17:54,520
No, I don't.

293
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:56,518
Dara was an "A" student.

294
00:17:56,518 --> 00:17:58,429
She didn't smoke,
she didn't do drugs.

295
00:17:58,429 --> 00:18:00,880
She was going to save her
modeling money to go to college.

296
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:02,940
Did you know Dara
had a P.O. Box?

297
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:05,400
No.

298
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:08,400
No return address. Signed by
someone named "Louise."

299
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,575
Well, she went to grammar
school with a girl named Louise...

300
00:18:11,575 --> 00:18:12,575
something.

301
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,200
She was my whole life.

302
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,000
Mrs. Winters,

303
00:18:20,956 --> 00:18:22,956
we're going to find out who
did this to your daughter.

304
00:18:26,795 --> 00:18:27,795
Okay?

305
00:18:28,680 --> 00:18:29,960
Yes.

306
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:35,747
Super-vee, twin-engines,
900 horsepower each.

307
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:38,547
Engines on that baby cost
more than your car.

308
00:18:38,920 --> 00:18:40,560
Maybe more than your car.

309
00:18:40,560 --> 00:18:44,160
Yeah, well, our friend Willie
wasn't exactly living large.

310
00:18:53,720 --> 00:18:54,720
Gasoline.

311
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:57,100
Yeah, and there's gas
cans under here.

312
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,400
Yep. That's a lot of
tanks for a little boat.

313
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:02,520
Obviously not for his boat.

314
00:19:02,520 --> 00:19:03,500
Obviously.

315
00:19:03,800 --> 00:19:04,960
The idiot was siphoning.

316
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:07,816
Yeah, but why steal cheap
gas at a buck-thirty?

317
00:19:07,816 --> 00:19:09,416
He could've gone to
the corner pump.

318
00:19:09,560 --> 00:19:10,860
Maybe it wasn't cheap.

319
00:19:12,560 --> 00:19:13,560
Let's find out.

320
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:31,600
Crystals we found on the barracks
floor are ordinary table salt.

321
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:34,300
So somebody's guilty
of seasoning.

322
00:19:35,000 --> 00:19:38,209
The yellow substance found in
the air filter of the ATV...

323
00:19:38,209 --> 00:19:41,069
matches the  pollen found in 
Dara's nasal cavity.

324
00:19:42,069 --> 00:19:43,120
Lignum vitae.

325
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:44,620
The hardest wood in the world.

326
00:19:46,232 --> 00:19:48,634
The U.S. Navy almost wiped
them out during World War II...

327
00:19:48,634 --> 00:19:50,234
using them for propeller pins.

328
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:51,835
They're very rare.

329
00:19:51,835 --> 00:19:55,125
The only places that they grow down here
are in Southwest Dade or in the keys.

330
00:19:55,125 --> 00:19:57,560
And there are none on the grounds
of Pharos Academy. I checked.

331
00:19:57,560 --> 00:20:01,760
So the ATV was where
Dara was killed.

332
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,900
It's too bad it can't
tell us what happened.

333
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:06,320
Maybe it can.
Hang on a second.

334
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:08,320
Horatio.

335
00:20:10,263 --> 00:20:11,363
Okay...
thank you.

336
00:20:12,680 --> 00:20:14,380
Well, there you have it.

337
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:20,146
blood from your
camouflaged pants ...

338
00:20:20,146 --> 00:20:22,209
matches a 15-year-old girl 
you've never seen.

339
00:20:22,209 --> 00:20:23,160
Can you explain that?

340
00:20:23,160 --> 00:20:24,600
I already told you.

341
00:20:25,152 --> 00:20:27,552
I never laid eyes on
this girl before in my life.

342
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:30,520
Right. But we found her
blood on your zipper.

343
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:32,520
I don't know
how it got there.

344
00:20:32,746 --> 00:20:36,968
Look, I'm very sorry for this girl and her 
family but if she was in my camp,

345
00:20:36,968 --> 00:20:37,800
then she was trespassing.

346
00:20:37,800 --> 00:20:39,201
Okay, fair enough.

347
00:20:39,201 --> 00:20:41,101
Then why don't we discuss
the ride that night.

348
00:20:41,800 --> 00:20:43,300
You got it all wrong.

349
00:20:44,196 --> 00:20:46,696
Last time I rode that ATV
was yesterday morning.

350
00:20:47,363 --> 00:20:51,363
I ran it out to the chapel then to
the latrine and back to admin.

351
00:20:54,564 --> 00:20:56,564
Whatever you guys are thinking,

352
00:20:57,827 --> 00:20:59,827
I didn't touch any of these girls.

353
00:21:00,996 --> 00:21:02,396
I'll take a lie-detector test ...

354
00:21:03,692 --> 00:21:04,520
Whatever you want.

355
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:06,680
All we need is your prints
and a nasal swab.

356
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:08,280
Knock yourself out.

357
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:16,602
AFIS kicked back nothing on 
the second set of diaphragm prints.

358
00:21:16,602 --> 00:21:17,840
Do you think 
his might match?

359
00:21:17,840 --> 00:21:18,640
I don't know.

360
00:21:19,448 --> 00:21:23,360
No bruising, no semen ... and
anyone could've ridden this ATV.

361
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:24,960
Yeah, but the blood on his zipper.

362
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:27,160
I think there might
be another explanation.

363
00:21:47,040 --> 00:21:48,760
Are you thinking
passive transfer?

364
00:21:48,760 --> 00:21:49,700
For now.

365
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,120
Hey, man.

366
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:56,240
Where have you been?

367
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:58,449
Waiting at DNA.

368
00:21:58,449 --> 00:22:01,560
They're back-logged into next week. 
I got to talk to Megan about that.

369
00:22:01,560 --> 00:22:03,960
Well, stand in line, because I left
her three messages already.

370
00:22:03,960 --> 00:22:04,720
Yeah?

371
00:22:05,757 --> 00:22:06,720
Something's going on.

372
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:08,720
Yeah. What'd you get?

373
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:11,711
Willie's saliva on the
last inch of that hose.

374
00:22:11,711 --> 00:22:13,711
Means that it wasn't shoved
all the way down his throat.

375
00:22:14,120 --> 00:22:16,176
Means he was siphoning.

376
00:22:16,176 --> 00:22:17,176
Look at this.

377
00:22:18,467 --> 00:22:21,467
Gas in those tanks was
straight-up park place.

378
00:22:21,958 --> 00:22:26,158
High octane; 120-plus.
It's got zero alcohols or oxygenates.

379
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:28,640
Yeah, it's used for, uh ...

380
00:22:28,640 --> 00:22:30,824
high-performance,
large bore engines.

381
00:22:30,824 --> 00:22:32,135
Super-vee's.

382
00:22:32,135 --> 00:22:33,520
He was stealing
from his neighbors.

383
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,018
The thing about 120-plus
is that it's very dangerous.

384
00:22:36,018 --> 00:22:37,487
It's got a low flash point.

385
00:22:37,487 --> 00:22:38,800
So you're not even supposed
to store it in the sun.

386
00:22:38,800 --> 00:22:40,480
Yeah, you can't buy it
at the pump, either.

387
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:42,320
Willie wasn't exactly
making friends.

388
00:22:42,320 --> 00:22:45,023
Well, you wouldn't know it
from his cell phone log.

389
00:22:45,023 --> 00:22:46,873
Delacroix sent over this fax.

390
00:22:46,873 --> 00:22:50,073
Willie's last hundred incomings; 
seventy-four came from one person.

391
00:22:50,160 --> 00:22:51,120
Ex-wife?

392
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,820
No, someone named motor.

393
00:22:56,680 --> 00:23:00,380
Willie's phone stalker is one
Timmy Diehl, A.K.A. Motor.

394
00:23:02,280 --> 00:23:03,926
He's a Bal Harbour Brat.

395
00:23:03,926 --> 00:23:05,326
Leads one of those
jet ski clubs.

396
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:07,040
How'd you get
him to come down?

397
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,360
I told him we found Willie.

398
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:11,320
Where's Willie?

399
00:23:11,320 --> 00:23:12,840
That's what we wanted
to talk to you about.

400
00:23:12,840 --> 00:23:15,960
Hey, motor, what do you
got under there? 800 cc's?

401
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:17,960
Try 1250, bored out.

402
00:23:17,960 --> 00:23:21,040
Wow, that's a big engine
for a little machine.

403
00:23:21,040 --> 00:23:23,160
It'll top-end anything
in this marina.

404
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:26,306
Engine that size really begs
for the good stuff, doesn't it?

405
00:23:26,306 --> 00:23:29,175
You know what I'm talking about 
--gas, 120-plus.

406
00:23:29,175 --> 00:23:32,875
Hey, do you think you could
outrun that? It's got triple 575'S.

407
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:43,120
Get me within a five-mile radius of
where the body was dumped, please.

408
00:23:44,320 --> 00:23:46,854
Lignum vitae is a short tree
with a heavy pollen.

409
00:23:46,854 --> 00:23:48,960
Fall rate's about twelve
centimeters per second.

410
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:51,720
Weather service had wind out of the
southwest at three-to-four knots.

411
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:53,230
With your average
eight-foot tree...

412
00:23:53,230 --> 00:23:56,230
you'll get a pollen footprint
of about fifty yards.

413
00:23:56,440 --> 00:23:59,819
So she took her last breath
within fifty yards of the pond...

414
00:23:59,819 --> 00:24:01,840
and just inside the 
academy perimeter.

415
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:04,000
It's about three miles from
where we found the body.

416
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,800
So somebody wanted
her off property, didn't they?

417
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,520
You see these outgoing
tracks right here?

418
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:20,280
Yeah.

419
00:24:20,280 --> 00:24:22,438
They're deeper and
about half an inch wider.

420
00:24:22,438 --> 00:24:23,540
So that says to me...

421
00:24:23,540 --> 00:24:27,340
the ATV came in with one passenger
and probably went out with two.

422
00:24:28,053 --> 00:24:31,753
It also says to me that
Jane Doe was here.

423
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:34,120
I've got something.

424
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:49,700
Got a red halter top ...

425
00:24:52,772 --> 00:24:55,172
and a black miniskirt.

426
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:00,720
This, ladies, is our
primary crime scene.

427
00:25:07,040 --> 00:25:09,260
Whoa. You picked up
a few passengers.

428
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,780
Hey, leeches.

429
00:25:12,080 --> 00:25:13,809
Take a look at that, please.

430
00:25:13,809 --> 00:25:15,858
Yes, it's a leech.

431
00:25:15,858 --> 00:25:17,358
Can leave his jaw behind.

432
00:25:18,826 --> 00:25:21,953
Instead, let's use some 
good old-fashioned saline solution.

433
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:22,953
May I?

434
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:30,520
Bye.

435
00:25:35,400 --> 00:25:36,800
Take care.
All right.

436
00:25:38,200 --> 00:25:39,200
So ...

437
00:25:40,390 --> 00:25:42,190
saline solution.

438
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:48,300
Salt.

439
00:25:48,600 --> 00:25:49,800
You got it.

440
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,861
Can you believe
these little piggies...

441
00:25:53,861 --> 00:25:57,261
will engorge themselves up to
ten times their original size?

442
00:26:02,440 --> 00:26:04,080
Leeches just fascinate me.

443
00:26:04,080 --> 00:26:06,649
Leech saliva.

444
00:26:06,649 --> 00:26:08,578
Medical marvel, you know.

445
00:26:08,578 --> 00:26:11,080
It contains enzymes that
expand your blood vessels.

446
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,660
Kind of like viagra.

447
00:26:13,160 --> 00:26:14,160
Well, not quite.

448
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:19,229
Unlike viagra it contains a mild
anesthetic so you don't feel the bite.

449
00:26:19,480 --> 00:26:21,620
Don't you hate it
when that happens?

450
00:26:21,720 --> 00:26:26,520
It also has plenty of hirudin.
Nature's own anticoagulant.

451
00:26:26,520 --> 00:26:28,390
You know, my mother
still doesn't believe me ...

452
00:26:28,390 --> 00:26:30,360
that they use leeches
in modern microsurgery.

453
00:26:30,360 --> 00:26:33,660
Yeah, well, let her lose a finger
she'll become a believer.

454
00:26:33,960 --> 00:26:38,054
Just slap this little mouth right
on to any reattached limb ...

455
00:26:38,054 --> 00:26:40,506
and watch them
do the housework.

456
00:26:40,506 --> 00:26:44,280
Vacuuming up all that used blood
so it doesn't cause gangrene.

457
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:47,401
Which explains why there was
no bruising on Dara Winters.

458
00:26:47,401 --> 00:26:49,981
The leeches removed
the surface blood.

459
00:26:49,981 --> 00:26:53,543
The high level of anticoagulant
acted like a blood thinner,

460
00:26:53,543 --> 00:26:56,843
so she never clotted.
Those bites...

461
00:26:56,960 --> 00:26:59,960
they bled for hours after the
leeches finished feeding.

462
00:27:02,160 --> 00:27:03,400
It's the beer.

463
00:27:05,000 --> 00:27:05,840
What about the beer?

464
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:08,779
The scent of beer is
like catnip for leeches.

465
00:27:08,779 --> 00:27:09,518
When I was little,

466
00:27:09,518 --> 00:27:13,018
we used to pour beer on leeches and
watch them whip into a feeding frenzy.

467
00:27:13,715 --> 00:27:15,715
That's why she had so 
many leeches on her body.

468
00:27:15,920 --> 00:27:17,760
At least she never felt it.

469
00:27:18,560 --> 00:27:19,560
Yeah.

470
00:27:29,720 --> 00:27:30,800
Got a minute?

471
00:27:32,800 --> 00:27:35,947
So we've been going through the
letters that we found in Dara's room ...

472
00:27:35,947 --> 00:27:38,447
and they seem to be written
in some type of a code.

473
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,600
It's typical for fifteen-year-old girls.

474
00:27:41,600 --> 00:27:44,281
Listen to this.
"Tell Q.B. No more.

475
00:27:44,281 --> 00:27:46,581
You have to get the
hell out of there."

476
00:27:48,917 --> 00:27:50,917
This girl has a secret,
doesn't she?

477
00:27:51,600 --> 00:27:53,640
Our leeches just
gave up their secret.

478
00:27:55,640 --> 00:27:57,080
You recovered the
rest of her blood?

479
00:27:57,080 --> 00:27:58,862
In over half the samples.

480
00:27:58,862 --> 00:28:01,788
And lord knows how many more are
burrowed out there, digesting.
It was death by leech.

481
00:28:01,788 --> 00:28:03,120
It was death by leech.

482
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:05,635
Well, they may
have killed her ...

483
00:28:05,635 --> 00:28:07,635
but they didn't move
her body, did they?

484
00:28:08,560 --> 00:28:11,960
Megan, it's Horatio.
Call me on my cell, will you?

485
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:18,300
Sergeant Marcus?

486
00:28:18,600 --> 00:28:20,560
No match on pollen or prints.
He's clean.

487
00:28:20,560 --> 00:28:23,960
He's clean. So that means
the answer is right over here.

488
00:28:24,960 --> 00:28:27,431
All right, ladies, listen up.

489
00:28:27,431 --> 00:28:29,131
We need you all to
roll up your pant legs.

490
00:28:36,600 --> 00:28:39,269
Ladies, we found salt 
crystals in your barracks and...

491
00:28:39,269 --> 00:28:42,120
we believe they were used 
to remove a certain parasite.

492
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:43,980
Come on, ladies, double time!

493
00:28:46,680 --> 00:28:47,900
You heard her, "Louise".

494
00:28:51,400 --> 00:28:52,740
That's your nickname, isn't it?

495
00:28:53,040 --> 00:28:55,640
Sir, this Cadet's name is
Julie Morales, sir!

496
00:28:58,680 --> 00:28:59,880
Will that be all, sir?

497
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:01,140
No, ma'am, it's not.

498
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:02,840
Now you.

499
00:29:04,569 --> 00:29:05,569
Let's go.

500
00:29:31,280 --> 00:29:32,280
Well, there you have it.

501
00:29:37,680 --> 00:29:39,680
Hey, sport, how you doing?

502
00:29:42,570 --> 00:29:45,970
Okay, let me help you out with this.
See that there?

503
00:29:46,400 --> 00:29:50,280
Now, that's 120-plus
high-performance gasoline.

504
00:29:50,280 --> 00:29:51,900
It's what you thought
you were buying.

505
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:55,479
And this one ...

506
00:29:55,479 --> 00:29:58,079
is not exactly
the Ferrari of fuels, is it?

507
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:01,200
And we got that from the
gas tank of your jet ski.

508
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:06,200
So, Willie was cutting your 120-plus
with gas from the corner pump...

509
00:30:07,370 --> 00:30:08,970
and trying to sell it 
to you for the real deal.

510
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,880
That bunk locked up my engine.
It cost me three grand.

511
00:30:13,280 --> 00:30:14,280
Yeah...

512
00:30:15,194 --> 00:30:18,194
I'd be pissed.
Sounds like motive for murder.

513
00:30:22,040 --> 00:30:23,360
What are you talking about?

514
00:30:23,560 --> 00:30:25,423
Well, you know, the guy's...

515
00:30:25,423 --> 00:30:28,345
ripping you off and you
know he's siphoning.

516
00:30:28,345 --> 00:30:29,445
So, you light him up.

517
00:30:30,560 --> 00:30:32,400
Look, I didn't kill anybody.

518
00:30:32,800 --> 00:30:34,860
Phone records
got you for stalking.

519
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:37,120
'Cause he was ducking me.

520
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,560
Seventy-four calls?

521
00:30:41,560 --> 00:30:42,880
He never answered.

522
00:30:43,280 --> 00:30:45,840
But he managed to pick up
the phone the morning he died.

523
00:30:48,040 --> 00:30:50,758
Look. I star-67'd him.

524
00:30:50,758 --> 00:30:53,758
And the minute he picked up,
the phone line went dead.

525
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:05,920
Horatio.

526
00:31:06,520 --> 00:31:08,520
Yeah?
Message for you, from Megan.

527
00:31:10,520 --> 00:31:11,520
Excuse me?

528
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:12,720
Message from Megan.

529
00:31:16,120 --> 00:31:17,120
Thank you.

530
00:31:19,126 --> 00:31:22,091
Um ... hang on a second.
This, uh ...

531
00:31:22,091 --> 00:31:22,891
this can't be right.

532
00:31:23,160 --> 00:31:25,660
She asked that you try not
to contact her anymore.

533
00:31:31,400 --> 00:31:32,760
Thank you.

534
00:31:35,760 --> 00:31:37,891
I wanted to cut Julie a break.

535
00:31:37,891 --> 00:31:39,030
I was on bed check.

536
00:31:39,030 --> 00:31:41,230
I heard talking coming from 
number two after lights out.

537
00:31:41,560 --> 00:31:43,120
And that's when you saw Dara?

538
00:31:43,320 --> 00:31:45,320
Yeah, I didn't know
who she was.

539
00:31:58,400 --> 00:32:01,105
The senior cadet is being
interrogated in the other room.

540
00:32:01,105 --> 00:32:03,205
I need you to talk to me.
Okay?

541
00:32:06,400 --> 00:32:08,280
I don't want to get in
any more trouble.

542
00:32:08,280 --> 00:32:11,002
Then you just have 
to help us out, Julie.

543
00:32:11,002 --> 00:32:13,802
We just want to find out what happened 
to Dara and why she came to you.

544
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:17,380
She was my best friend.

545
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:21,480
I told her she had
to leave immediately.

546
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,440
I escorted her to the
front gate and I left her there.

547
00:32:28,040 --> 00:32:30,654
See, leeches need a water source.

548
00:32:30,654 --> 00:32:33,854
And those leech bites on your legs
indicate to me that you were at the pond.

549
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,680
And going by your record ...

550
00:32:38,242 --> 00:32:40,442
and your history of violence...

551
00:32:42,653 --> 00:32:45,653
I think you roughed her up
and you left her there.

552
00:32:46,838 --> 00:32:48,838
And then you found
her dead the next morning,

553
00:32:50,201 --> 00:32:52,401
then you dumped her body
a few miles away ...

554
00:32:53,410 --> 00:32:55,410
just to cover it up.

555
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:09,220
I found her by the pond at 0700
during morning rounds.

556
00:33:12,641 --> 00:33:14,741
I drove up and she
was just lying there.

557
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:42,120
I didn't want to get in trouble for not
reporting her the night before.

558
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,640
I'm sorry.

559
00:33:49,240 --> 00:33:50,840
Why did Dara cut her hair?

560
00:33:51,640 --> 00:33:52,740
She hated it.

561
00:33:55,618 --> 00:33:57,418
Hated those stupid clothes, too.

562
00:34:04,960 --> 00:34:07,160
Why was she running away, Julie?

563
00:34:08,657 --> 00:34:10,657
Did it have anything to do
with why you assaulted her mom?

564
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:15,419
We talked to your parents. 
They told us the whole story.

565
00:34:17,200 --> 00:34:19,040
They didn't tell you my story.

566
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:22,240
They didn't believe me.

567
00:34:24,738 --> 00:34:26,138
No one ever believed me.

568
00:34:28,080 --> 00:34:29,080
I'll believe you ...

569
00:34:30,387 --> 00:34:31,387
if you tell me the truth.

570
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:42,200
Dara was sick of the modeling.

571
00:34:43,609 --> 00:34:48,609
She was sick of everything.
Always having to be perfect.

572
00:34:49,520 --> 00:34:52,520
You're beautiful,
you're going to be great.

573
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:59,120
But queen bitch
wouldn't let her quit.

574
00:34:59,720 --> 00:35:00,980
You mean her mother?

575
00:35:01,680 --> 00:35:03,640
She made her do a lot of things.

576
00:35:05,040 --> 00:35:06,040
What kind of things?

577
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:10,980
No, mom, please.
Dara.

578
00:35:11,880 --> 00:35:12,920
No, mom ...

579
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:14,840
Dara.
Please.

580
00:35:15,720 --> 00:35:17,320
Her mom always told her:

581
00:35:18,885 --> 00:35:21,485
"no choir girl ever made the A-list."

582
00:35:26,080 --> 00:35:29,008
So, Willie was siphoning
gas as a side gig.

583
00:35:29,008 --> 00:35:30,908
Which means he was
sucking in a lot of fumes.

584
00:35:32,360 --> 00:35:35,460
That explains his milk Jones.
He was trying to settle his stomach.

585
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:42,740
Gasoline has only one use.
To ignite.

586
00:35:43,440 --> 00:35:44,780
So what ignited it?

587
00:35:46,480 --> 00:35:49,680
I don't know, maybe fillings
in his mouth caused a spark.

588
00:35:51,880 --> 00:35:53,869
Not according to his dental records.

589
00:35:53,869 --> 00:35:56,869
This guy had perfect teeth.
Maybe static electricity.

590
00:35:57,080 --> 00:35:58,589
A heck of a shag carpet.

591
00:35:58,589 --> 00:36:00,589
Maybe he had some
build-up from it.

592
00:36:05,040 --> 00:36:06,324
You know when you're pumping gas...

593
00:36:06,324 --> 00:36:07,924
you're not supposed
to get in and out of your car?

594
00:36:08,714 --> 00:36:10,214
Or talk on the cell phone.

595
00:36:17,400 --> 00:36:21,300
Lithium batteries put out
3.7 volts of electricity.

596
00:36:26,920 --> 00:36:28,020
What do you want?

597
00:36:33,000 --> 00:36:35,020
I guess he had to take
that phone call.

598
00:36:37,720 --> 00:36:38,760
Trip out.

599
00:36:38,760 --> 00:36:40,360
They say these things
can kill you.

600
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:52,920
Thanks.

601
00:37:08,520 --> 00:37:11,020
Bet you even money
that's airborne pollen.

602
00:37:11,978 --> 00:37:12,978
Let's print this car.

603
00:37:13,960 --> 00:37:15,580
Will someone please
tell me why I'm here?

604
00:37:17,080 --> 00:37:18,120
They took my car.

605
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:19,720
Beautiful girl.

606
00:37:23,180 --> 00:37:24,380
Sad eyes, though.

607
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:29,460
What the hell is this?

608
00:37:29,760 --> 00:37:32,280
You were out there the night
Dara died, weren't you?

609
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:33,440
Of course not.

610
00:37:33,640 --> 00:37:37,969
We found a very specific airborne 
pollen on the headrest of your car...

611
00:37:37,969 --> 00:37:40,769
which would put you within fifty 
yards of where she took her last breath.

612
00:37:42,040 --> 00:37:44,240
She was running
away from you, wasn't she?

613
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:46,240
To Julie.

614
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:48,619
She would go wherever Julie was.

615
00:37:51,796 --> 00:37:53,558
So you drove out there...

616
00:37:53,558 --> 00:37:56,108
to bring her back to bring
her back to everything...

617
00:37:56,108 --> 00:37:57,608
she was running away from, right?

618
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:04,400
Dara?

619
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:08,000
What have you done to your hair?!
Dara, you stay there!

620
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:09,800
I'm not gonna do it anymore.
I won't go back!

621
00:38:09,800 --> 00:38:10,760
You don't have a choice.

622
00:38:10,760 --> 00:38:11,600
It's my life!

623
00:38:11,600 --> 00:38:13,160
No, life is about making sacrifices.

624
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:15,040
I'm gonna tell!
I'm gonna tell everyone!

625
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:16,080
Shut up!

626
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:19,880
No, Dara, don't! Dara!

627
00:38:33,240 --> 00:38:34,440
And then you left her there.

628
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:37,375
No, I was expecting her
to come home the next day.

629
00:38:39,375 --> 00:38:42,067
Dara was special.
She was going places.

630
00:38:42,067 --> 00:38:44,100
Anyone could tell.
But she was throwing it all away.

631
00:38:45,212 --> 00:38:47,413
And for what?
A date at the mall?

632
00:38:48,013 --> 00:38:49,596
High school football
on Friday nights?

633
00:38:49,596 --> 00:38:52,600
Some kind of average
Briar Bay existence?

634
00:38:52,600 --> 00:38:55,500
To three-quarters of the world
that sounds like a slice of heaven.

635
00:38:56,014 --> 00:38:58,714
She was running away from you
because you made her home-life hell.

636
00:38:58,760 --> 00:39:01,561
All I did was set up auditions.

637
00:39:01,561 --> 00:39:03,320
I was trying to help
her to succeed.

638
00:39:03,320 --> 00:39:06,420
You were forcing her to market
herself to get modeling jobs.

639
00:39:08,560 --> 00:39:09,300
Right?

640
00:39:13,000 --> 00:39:17,700
Now, we have a second
print on her diaphragm...

641
00:39:19,313 --> 00:39:20,313
--your prints.

642
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:27,280
We matched it to the
prints we found in your car.

643
00:39:28,280 --> 00:39:30,400
"No choir girl ever made the A-list."

644
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:31,920
Isn't that what you told her?

645
00:39:32,800 --> 00:39:34,080
No, you don't understand.

646
00:39:35,080 --> 00:39:36,080
No, I don't.

647
00:39:37,280 --> 00:39:41,880
I told you that I would figure out
who did this, didn't I?

648
00:39:53,040 --> 00:39:54,020
Knock, knock.

649
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:57,160
Come on in.

650
00:39:58,360 --> 00:39:59,960
Me and the guys are
going for a beer.

651
00:40:01,238 --> 00:40:02,238
You want to come?

652
00:40:03,760 --> 00:40:05,360
Mind if I take a rain check?

653
00:40:11,600 --> 00:40:12,840
You all right?

654
00:40:15,840 --> 00:40:17,140
Megan resigned.

655
00:40:19,896 --> 00:40:23,396
She said that work was too much
of a reminder of her husband's death.

656
00:40:24,720 --> 00:40:25,720
It's a shame.

657
00:40:27,865 --> 00:40:29,265
She was a good criminalist.

658
00:40:29,760 --> 00:40:30,760
She was.

659
00:40:32,644 --> 00:40:33,644
She was indeed.

660
00:40:38,200 --> 00:40:39,700
I almost walked once.

661
00:40:52,840 --> 00:40:54,220
I'll see you tomorrow.

662
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:56,320
Yep.
