1
00:03:20,687 --> 00:03:24,057
What the...? Who's that?

2
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:25,491
You're bad

3
00:03:25,592 --> 00:03:26,726
Who grabbed me?

4
00:03:26,793 --> 00:03:28,761
Who grabbed me?

5
00:03:28,895 --> 00:03:30,930
Who grabbed me?

6
00:03:32,232 --> 00:03:33,466
Honey, you're gonna be late

7
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:34,934
What'd you grab me for?

8
00:03:36,102 --> 00:03:38,304
Mom, I can't find my shoes for school

9
00:03:38,471 --> 00:03:40,006
They're under the couch

10
00:03:41,975 --> 00:03:43,910
Dad, will you sign
my permission slip for tomorrow?

11
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:45,445
Give it to your mother

12
00:03:45,845 --> 00:03:47,547
Your mother's arms are full

13
00:03:48,681 --> 00:03:49,716
You got time for pancakes?

14
00:03:49,816 --> 00:03:50,783
Nope

15
00:03:50,884 --> 00:03:52,552
Give us another one, Dad

16
00:03:53,820 --> 00:03:55,188
Secretary of Defense?

17
00:03:55,288 --> 00:03:56,222
Dean Rusk

18
00:03:56,356 --> 00:03:57,557
Wrong

19
00:03:57,624 --> 00:03:59,225
And you get to wax my car

20
00:03:59,292 --> 00:04:02,328
Rusk is State, moron
It's Robert McNamara

21
00:04:02,462 --> 00:04:03,530
Attorney General?

22
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:04,697
Too Easy!

23
00:04:04,764 --> 00:04:06,366
It's Bobby Kennedy

24
00:04:08,535 --> 00:04:12,672
All right, wise guys. Assistant
Secretary of State for Latin America

25
00:04:12,805 --> 00:04:14,274
That's too hard

26
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:16,242
Wait a minute

27
00:04:16,509 --> 00:04:18,244
This isn't a permission slip

28
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:22,782
This is your report card!

29
00:04:23,149 --> 00:04:24,951
Have you seen these grades?

30
00:04:25,084 --> 00:04:26,386
No

31
00:04:27,620 --> 00:04:28,888
All right. Gotta go

32
00:04:28,955 --> 00:04:30,623
Be good

33
00:04:32,692 --> 00:04:34,327
You...

34
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:36,095
And I'm talking to you later

35
00:07:12,585 --> 00:07:13,419
Morning, Evelyn

36
00:07:13,553 --> 00:07:15,021
Hi, Ken

37
00:07:16,523 --> 00:07:19,058
Those candies are for the kids

38
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:38,711
Morning, Floyd

39
00:07:38,811 --> 00:07:40,180
Morning, Mr. O'Donnell

40
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:53,760
Morning, Jackie

41
00:07:53,860 --> 00:07:54,327
Hi, Kenny

42
00:07:54,427 --> 00:07:54,928
Want a schedule?

43
00:07:55,061 --> 00:07:55,962
No

44
00:07:56,062 --> 00:07:59,032
Why'd you cross
all my people off the list?

45
00:07:59,098 --> 00:08:01,768
You don't have anybody on it
who means anything

46
00:08:01,868 --> 00:08:03,169
No votes there, there's not money

47
00:08:03,269 --> 00:08:04,504
It's party, Kenny

48
00:08:04,637 --> 00:08:06,239
And the one thing
that we both can be sure of

49
00:08:06,372 --> 00:08:08,474
is that you don't know
how to have a party

50
00:08:08,575 --> 00:08:10,810
Well, party to you, politics to me

51
00:08:12,178 --> 00:08:14,581
So, who do you want? For real

52
00:08:14,681 --> 00:08:16,149
Everyone on my list

53
00:08:16,282 --> 00:08:18,484
I don't want to spend
an entire evening pretending that

54
00:08:18,618 --> 00:08:21,487
your votes and money are more
interesting than they really are

55
00:08:21,588 --> 00:08:23,957
And I want my kids to stop
eating the candy in the Oval Office

56
00:08:24,057 --> 00:08:25,158
That's not me

57
00:08:25,291 --> 00:08:26,559
Then who is it?

58
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:28,828
I don't rat on my friends

59
00:08:29,462 --> 00:08:32,165
I'm going to take this whole
list thing up with your "friend"

60
00:08:32,265 --> 00:08:33,900
Are you trying to go around me?

61
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,469
Go around you, over you, through you

62
00:08:36,503 --> 00:08:37,971
Whatever it takes

63
00:08:38,404 --> 00:08:39,873
You're starting to bug me

64
00:08:40,006 --> 00:08:41,307
Good

65
00:08:41,641 --> 00:08:43,209
I'll get back to you

66
00:08:48,014 --> 00:08:49,782
Top of the morning, Mr. President

67
00:08:49,849 --> 00:08:51,284
Morning, Kenny

68
00:08:51,784 --> 00:08:53,419
Just ran into your wife

69
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:55,355
Wanna talk about this party?

70
00:08:55,488 --> 00:08:56,756
No

71
00:08:57,223 --> 00:09:00,693
You see Homer Capehart's tirade today?

72
00:09:00,793 --> 00:09:01,594
I did

73
00:09:01,694 --> 00:09:02,862
Don't see why
he needs to invent an issue

74
00:09:02,896 --> 00:09:05,131
He's got his election sewn up

75
00:09:05,532 --> 00:09:07,433
Even so
we should still go out for Bayh

76
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:09,602
It's good groundwork for us in '64

77
00:09:10,270 --> 00:09:13,173
I'm looking for that...

78
00:09:13,239 --> 00:09:15,208
Vietnam thing

79
00:09:15,308 --> 00:09:16,342
The two planes that went down?

80
00:09:16,509 --> 00:09:17,777
Yeah

81
00:09:17,911 --> 00:09:20,013
It didn't make it before press time

82
00:09:20,113 --> 00:09:21,814
I haven't taken a look
at the West Coast papers yet

83
00:09:21,915 --> 00:09:24,117
but I doubt
we'll see anything 'til tomorrow

84
00:09:25,919 --> 00:09:27,754
I was eating that

85
00:09:28,588 --> 00:09:29,122
No, you weren't

86
00:09:29,255 --> 00:09:30,723
I was

87
00:09:30,824 --> 00:09:31,424
No, you weren't

88
00:09:31,524 --> 00:09:38,231
I was, you bastard

89
00:09:38,331 --> 00:09:40,433
so what have we got today?

90
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:41,768
Today...

91
00:09:51,578 --> 00:09:52,779
That's it

92
00:09:52,812 --> 00:09:54,681
That's the one we're looking for

93
00:09:56,182 --> 00:09:58,484
I nee dot see the president, Kenny

94
00:09:59,018 --> 00:10:01,087
2:30 to 2:45

95
00:10:01,154 --> 00:10:02,589
or 4:30 to 5:00. Take your pick

96
00:10:02,689 --> 00:10:04,691
I need to see him now, Ken

97
00:10:07,494 --> 00:10:09,729
Then go on up
I'll let him know you're coming

98
00:10:14,434 --> 00:10:15,602
Coffee?

99
00:10:15,668 --> 00:10:17,103
Yeah

100
00:10:18,571 --> 00:10:21,374
That's not what you said

101
00:10:21,508 --> 00:10:22,842
That's not what...

102
00:10:22,976 --> 00:10:25,245
Listen to me
you worthless piece of shit

103
00:10:25,311 --> 00:10:27,313
You will put Daly's man on the circuit

104
00:10:27,413 --> 00:10:29,482
and you'll do it today

105
00:10:29,582 --> 00:10:32,619
You owe your gaddamn job
to this administration

106
00:10:32,685 --> 00:10:34,754
Are you saying I'm not grateful?

107
00:10:34,888 --> 00:10:38,091
Yeah, I can hear how grateful you are

108
00:10:38,191 --> 00:10:39,926
There's a word you need to learn

109
00:10:39,993 --> 00:10:41,828
It's the only word in politics

110
00:10:41,895 --> 00:10:43,029
It's called loyalty

111
00:10:43,163 --> 00:10:44,898
Loyalty

112
00:10:45,532 --> 00:10:48,434
Now, is there any part of this
you don't understand?

113
00:10:49,002 --> 00:10:50,203
Good

114
00:10:52,038 --> 00:10:53,473
What?

115
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,376
This isn't the blessed order
of St. Mary the Meek

116
00:10:56,476 --> 00:10:58,545
You better come in here

117
00:10:59,746 --> 00:11:01,948
What was it you were saying to me
the other day about Cuba?

118
00:11:02,048 --> 00:11:03,516
That it wasn't important

119
00:11:03,650 --> 00:11:04,817
Not as far as the election goes

120
00:11:04,984 --> 00:11:05,819
Mac!

121
00:11:05,952 --> 00:11:08,154
Can I see that for a second, please?

122
00:11:09,222 --> 00:11:10,924
Here, Kenny. You used to
look down a bombsight for a living

123
00:11:11,057 --> 00:11:15,061
Just ignore the labels
What does that look like to you?

124
00:11:19,432 --> 00:11:20,900
I don't know

125
00:11:22,101 --> 00:11:22,836
What is it?

126
00:11:23,002 --> 00:11:28,708
Our U-2's took these pictures of Soviet
medium- range ballistic missiles in Cuba

127
00:11:28,842 --> 00:11:31,110
They appear to be the SS-4
range of a thousand miles

128
00:11:31,211 --> 00:11:34,514
three megaton nuclear warheads

129
00:11:34,581 --> 00:11:37,417
Seen here in this year's
May Day Parade in Red Square

130
00:11:41,888 --> 00:11:43,923
Jesus Christ in heaven

131
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:48,261
White House operator

132
00:11:48,394 --> 00:11:52,298
Mr. O'Donnell, please
for Secretary McNamara

133
00:11:54,334 --> 00:11:57,003
White House operator

134
00:11:59,205 --> 00:12:00,507
What the crap is going on today?

135
00:12:00,607 --> 00:12:01,407
That's right

136
00:12:01,541 --> 00:12:03,643
The principals
are assembling in an hour

137
00:12:03,776 --> 00:12:04,878
See you then

138
00:12:05,411 --> 00:12:06,779
Where's Bobby?

139
00:12:06,813 --> 00:12:07,881
He should be here any minute

140
00:12:07,947 --> 00:12:08,815
Oh, good

141
00:12:13,786 --> 00:12:15,522
Good

142
00:12:17,590 --> 00:12:18,825
Where the hell are you?

143
00:12:18,958 --> 00:12:20,860
We're in here

144
00:12:23,363 --> 00:12:25,098
Jesus Christ, guys

145
00:12:25,231 --> 00:12:26,366
What the hell is Kruschev thinking?

146
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:28,902
Did you have any indication of this
from your KGB pal, Bolshakov?

147
00:12:29,068 --> 00:12:31,404
Any possible warning
or sense of motivation?

148
00:12:31,538 --> 00:12:32,705
Complete snowjob

149
00:12:32,805 --> 00:12:35,542
Then we went out and told the country
they weren't putting missiles into Cuba

150
00:12:36,376 --> 00:12:37,844
Jesus

151
00:12:38,378 --> 00:12:41,548
I feel like we caught the Jap
carrier steaming for Pearl Harbor

152
00:13:03,303 --> 00:13:04,137
Morning, gentlemen

153
00:13:04,204 --> 00:13:05,839
Morning, Mr. President

154
00:13:05,939 --> 00:13:06,706
Mr. Secretary

155
00:13:06,840 --> 00:13:07,841
Mr. President

156
00:13:07,941 --> 00:13:09,542
Bob. Bet you had a late night

157
00:13:09,642 --> 00:13:11,311
Sleep is for the week, Mr. President

158
00:13:11,377 --> 00:13:12,779
Mr. President

159
00:13:12,912 --> 00:13:14,647
CIA's been notified

160
00:13:14,814 --> 00:13:17,083
McCone's on his way back
from the West coast

161
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:19,219
He's been burying his step-son

162
00:13:19,285 --> 00:13:20,887
General Carter's here, though

163
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:25,091
Ted

164
00:13:25,158 --> 00:13:26,526
Kenny

165
00:13:27,126 --> 00:13:28,728
Okay

166
00:13:31,197 --> 00:13:32,599
Let's have it

167
00:13:33,099 --> 00:13:34,367
Arthur?

168
00:13:34,767 --> 00:13:36,336
Gentlemen, as most of you now know

169
00:13:36,436 --> 00:13:39,305
a U-2 over Cuba

170
00:13:39,405 --> 00:13:41,841
Sunday morning took
a series of disturbing photographs

171
00:13:41,908 --> 00:13:43,810
Our analysis at NPIC indicates
that the Soviet Union

172
00:13:43,910 --> 00:13:48,448
has followed up its conventional
weapons build-up in Cuba

173
00:13:48,548 --> 00:13:49,215
with the introduction of

174
00:13:49,282 --> 00:13:55,421
surface- to-surface medium range
ballistic missiles, or MRBM's

175
00:13:55,488 --> 00:13:58,858
Our official estimate at this time
is that this missiles system

176
00:13:58,958 --> 00:14:01,828
is the SS-4 Sandal

177
00:14:01,961 --> 00:14:04,597
We do not believe that

178
00:14:04,731 --> 00:14:06,065
the missiles are as yet operational

179
00:14:06,199 --> 00:14:09,502
IRONBARK reports that the SS-4

180
00:14:09,569 --> 00:14:12,071
can deliver a 3-megaton
nuclear weapon 1, 000 miles

181
00:14:12,172 --> 00:14:14,641
So far we've identified 32 missiles
serviced by about 3, 400 men

182
00:14:14,774 --> 00:14:19,879
undoubtedly all Soviet personnel

183
00:14:20,046 --> 00:14:22,782
Our cities and military installations
in the southeast

184
00:14:22,816 --> 00:14:25,218
as far north as Washington, D. C.

185
00:14:25,285 --> 00:14:27,687
are in range of these weapons

186
00:14:27,787 --> 00:14:30,890
and in the event of a launch would
have only five minutes of warning

187
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:32,392
Five minutes, gentlemen

188
00:14:32,458 --> 00:14:33,660
In those five minutes

189
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,563
they could kill 80 million Americans

190
00:14:36,596 --> 00:14:42,235
and destroy a significant
percentage of our bomber bases

191
00:14:43,803 --> 00:14:46,272
The Joint Chiefs' consensus
Mr. President

192
00:14:46,339 --> 00:14:50,009
is that this signals a major
doctrinal shift in Soviet thinking

193
00:14:50,076 --> 00:14:52,846
to a first-strike policy

194
00:14:52,946 --> 00:14:56,182
It is a massively destabilizing move

195
00:14:56,282 --> 00:14:58,084
How long until they're operational?

196
00:14:58,184 --> 00:15:00,787
General Taylor can answer
that question better than I can

197
00:15:00,954 --> 00:15:03,423
GMAIC- Guided Missiles
Intelligence Committee

198
00:15:03,490 --> 00:15:06,159
estimates ten to fourteen days

199
00:15:07,093 --> 00:15:09,395
A crash program could limit that time

200
00:15:09,529 --> 00:15:13,199
However, I must stress that
there may be more missiles

201
00:15:13,299 --> 00:15:15,034
that we don't know about

202
00:15:15,468 --> 00:15:17,504
We need more U-2 coverage

203
00:15:17,570 --> 00:15:19,572
Gentlemen, I want first reactions here

204
00:15:19,639 --> 00:15:21,307
Assuming for the moment that Krushev
has not gone off the deep end

205
00:15:21,407 --> 00:15:23,710
and intends to start World War Three

206
00:15:23,810 --> 00:15:25,111
What are we looking for?

207
00:15:25,245 --> 00:15:28,848
Mr. President, My team is in agreement

208
00:15:28,915 --> 00:15:31,117
If we permit
the introduction of nuclear missiles

209
00:15:31,184 --> 00:15:34,154
to a Soviet satellite nation
in our hemisphere

210
00:15:34,254 --> 00:15:38,925
the diplomatic consequences
will be too terrible to contemplate

211
00:15:38,992 --> 00:15:42,028
The Russians are trying to show the
world they can do whatever they want

212
00:15:42,095 --> 00:15:43,496
wherever they want
and we're powerless to stop them

213
00:15:43,596 --> 00:15:44,531
If they succeed

214
00:15:44,597 --> 00:15:46,466
It'll be Munich all over again

215
00:15:46,566 --> 00:15:50,036
Yes. Appeasement only makes
the aggressor more aggressive

216
00:15:50,136 --> 00:15:52,839
And the Soviets will be
emboldened to push us even harder

217
00:15:52,906 --> 00:15:55,775
No, we must remove the missiles
one way or another

218
00:15:55,909 --> 00:15:57,810
It seems to me the options are either

219
00:15:57,977 --> 00:15:59,445
some combination of
international pressure

220
00:15:59,546 --> 00:16:02,649
and action on our part
till they give up

221
00:16:02,782 --> 00:16:04,617
or...

222
00:16:04,751 --> 00:16:06,352
we hit them

223
00:16:06,452 --> 00:16:08,354
An air strike

224
00:16:08,488 --> 00:16:09,589
Bob?

225
00:16:09,722 --> 00:16:12,158
We've worked up
several military scenarios

226
00:16:12,292 --> 00:16:14,761
Before I ask General Taylor to
take us through the various options

227
00:16:14,828 --> 00:16:16,796
I'd like for us to adopt a rule

228
00:16:16,930 --> 00:16:19,032
If we strike

229
00:16:19,132 --> 00:16:23,570
we must agree to do it before
the missiles become operational

230
00:16:23,636 --> 00:16:26,573
Because once they are

231
00:16:26,639 --> 00:16:28,641
I don't think we can guarantee

232
00:16:28,775 --> 00:16:30,844
getting them all before
at least some of them are launched

233
00:16:32,278 --> 00:16:33,146
It's clear

234
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:35,982
we cannot permit Soviet
nuclear missiles in Cuba

235
00:16:41,921 --> 00:16:44,424
We have to get those missiles out

236
00:16:45,391 --> 00:16:48,761
I don't think it's going to matter
what Kruschev's intentions are

237
00:16:49,629 --> 00:16:50,430
Right now

238
00:16:50,497 --> 00:16:53,633
I don't see any way
around hitting them

239
00:16:53,700 --> 00:16:55,301
If we kill a lot of Russians

240
00:16:55,435 --> 00:16:56,903
they'll move against Berlin

241
00:16:57,003 --> 00:17:00,340
If they attack Berlin, that's NATO

242
00:17:00,406 --> 00:17:01,641
and we're at war

243
00:17:01,741 --> 00:17:03,176
We're damned if we do, but if we don't

244
00:17:03,309 --> 00:17:04,644
we're in a war for sure
somewhere else in six months

245
00:17:04,711 --> 00:17:06,179
If there are alternatives
that make sense

246
00:17:06,246 --> 00:17:08,248
and I'm not saying that there are

247
00:17:08,348 --> 00:17:09,682
then we need 'em, and fast

248
00:17:09,816 --> 00:17:11,784
What about Congress?

249
00:17:11,885 --> 00:17:13,753
We may need to
start letting key people know

250
00:17:13,920 --> 00:17:15,688
And they're all scattered
across the country for the campaign

251
00:17:15,788 --> 00:17:16,689
We can get Congress back

252
00:17:16,756 --> 00:17:19,359
We're gonna need to
get the U. N. staff in and warmed up

253
00:17:19,425 --> 00:17:20,527
What about the allies?

254
00:17:20,660 --> 00:17:22,395
We can't start
worrying about everything

255
00:17:22,495 --> 00:17:23,463
Right now we gotta figure out
what we're gonna do

256
00:17:23,596 --> 00:17:25,331
before we worry about
how we're gonna do it

257
00:17:25,431 --> 00:17:27,367
Well, we've got a bunch of smart guys

258
00:17:27,433 --> 00:17:29,669
We lock 'em in a room
and kick 'em in the ass

259
00:17:29,736 --> 00:17:32,205
until they come up
with some solutions

260
00:17:33,973 --> 00:17:35,708
I'll do it

261
00:17:37,844 --> 00:17:40,380
It's too politicized with you
in there anyway

262
00:17:40,446 --> 00:17:42,048
They need to be able to
stick their necks out

263
00:17:42,148 --> 00:17:43,516
Yeah. It'll be the principals

264
00:17:43,583 --> 00:17:46,286
a couple of they key guys
from each department

265
00:17:46,386 --> 00:17:49,823
The Executive Committee
of the National Security Council

266
00:17:49,923 --> 00:17:52,592
We'll can it EXCOM

267
00:17:52,725 --> 00:17:54,093
Okay

268
00:17:54,194 --> 00:17:57,397
So I'm only gonna show
for the meetings that you call me into

269
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:59,132
Impress us

270
00:17:59,265 --> 00:18:01,134
Did it fast

271
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:03,970
Kenny, you're in charge of
keeping this thing quiet

272
00:18:04,070 --> 00:18:05,004
If word gets out
before we know what we're gonna do

273
00:18:05,138 --> 00:18:07,473
there's gonna be panic

274
00:18:07,607 --> 00:18:08,708
And it's gonna ruin any chance

275
00:18:08,808 --> 00:18:11,177
we might have of surprise
if we decide to hit them

276
00:18:11,277 --> 00:18:13,880
We're gonna need to
do a few things right away

277
00:18:13,980 --> 00:18:15,682
No Pierre

278
00:18:15,782 --> 00:18:17,984
He knows, the press knows

279
00:18:18,518 --> 00:18:20,286
And you're gonna have to
keep up your schedule

280
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,288
Your movements
are followed too closely

281
00:18:22,388 --> 00:18:24,190
George Ball's
got a conference room at State

282
00:18:24,257 --> 00:18:25,058
Good

283
00:18:25,158 --> 00:18:26,759
You meet over there this afternoon

284
00:18:26,893 --> 00:18:29,329
We'll figure out a way to
sneak you guys back in here tonight

285
00:18:29,429 --> 00:18:32,298
I think we should
bring in Dean Acheson

286
00:18:33,399 --> 00:18:33,833
Ken

287
00:18:33,967 --> 00:18:37,804
he was fighting Soviets while we were
still playing ball together at school

288
00:18:39,372 --> 00:18:41,074
Find him, Kenny

289
00:18:42,142 --> 00:18:43,977
We're gonna need
all the help we can get

290
00:18:45,812 --> 00:18:47,981
Screw secrecy

291
00:18:52,352 --> 00:18:56,789
Try having that fat-ass, sit on your
lap all the way from Foggy Bottom

292
00:18:56,856 --> 00:18:59,859
You were excited. I say no more

293
00:18:59,993 --> 00:19:02,695
Everybody agrees
the diplomatic route won't work

294
00:19:02,795 --> 00:19:05,765
It's too slow and they'll finish the
missiles while we're still talking

295
00:19:06,232 --> 00:19:09,802
I hear old Warren Harding
used to get his grills in through here

296
00:19:09,936 --> 00:19:12,772
We have 850 planes
assembling at Homestead

297
00:19:12,906 --> 00:19:18,611
Eglin, Opa Locka, MacDill
Partick, Pensacola, and Key West

298
00:19:19,445 --> 00:19:21,381
Due to the tropical foliage

299
00:19:21,514 --> 00:19:24,150
the OPLAN calls for high explosive

300
00:19:24,184 --> 00:19:25,919
and napalm loadouts
for our ground attack sorties

301
00:19:25,985 --> 00:19:28,488
I still think
there are diplomatic approaches

302
00:19:28,655 --> 00:19:29,756
we haven't considered yet

303
00:19:29,856 --> 00:19:31,825
Peace at any price?

304
00:19:31,891 --> 00:19:33,626
We have a gun to our head

305
00:19:34,460 --> 00:19:38,231
We have high confidence in the expanded
air strike option, Mr. President

306
00:19:38,364 --> 00:19:39,732
The problem, sir

307
00:19:39,833 --> 00:19:42,135
is that it's a short-term solution

308
00:19:42,268 --> 00:19:44,804
Kruschev can send in
more missiles next month

309
00:19:44,971 --> 00:19:46,439
The Chiefs and I believe
we should follow up the air strikes

310
00:19:46,573 --> 00:19:50,810
with the full version of OPLAN 316

311
00:19:50,910 --> 00:19:51,478
An invasion?

312
00:19:51,578 --> 00:19:52,946
Yes, sir

313
00:19:53,046 --> 00:19:54,681
We can be sure we get all the missiles

314
00:19:54,747 --> 00:19:56,483
and we remove Castro

315
00:19:56,516 --> 00:19:58,184
so this can never happen again

316
00:19:58,284 --> 00:19:59,853
Is this
the Joint Chief's recommendation?

317
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:01,020
Yes, sir

318
00:20:01,187 --> 00:20:03,490
Our best option
as Bob pointed out this morning

319
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:07,660
would be to commence the strikes
before the missiles become operational

320
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:10,797
The invasion happens eight days later

321
00:20:12,665 --> 00:20:14,534
Dean

322
00:20:15,168 --> 00:20:16,769
What do you think?

323
00:20:17,103 --> 00:20:18,137
Gentlemen

324
00:20:18,271 --> 00:20:20,440
for the last fifteen years
I have fought here at this table

325
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,909
alongside your predecessors

326
00:20:22,942 --> 00:20:25,078
in a struggle against the Soviet

327
00:20:25,211 --> 00:20:27,413
I do not wish to seem melodramatic

328
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:29,449
but I do wish to impress upon you

329
00:20:29,549 --> 00:20:31,618
a lesson I learned with bitter tears

330
00:20:31,718 --> 00:20:33,052
and great sacrifice

331
00:20:33,186 --> 00:20:35,088
The Soviet understands
only one language

332
00:20:35,188 --> 00:20:36,222
action

333
00:20:36,389 --> 00:20:38,024
Respects only one word

334
00:20:38,124 --> 00:20:39,359
Force

335
00:20:39,459 --> 00:20:41,528
I concur with General Taylor

336
00:20:41,661 --> 00:20:44,797
I recommend air strikes
followed by invasion

337
00:20:44,864 --> 00:20:46,466
perhaps

338
00:20:46,599 --> 00:20:48,401
proceeded by an ultimatum
to dismantle the missiles

339
00:20:48,501 --> 00:20:50,036
If that is militarily viable

340
00:20:50,203 --> 00:20:52,539
So it appears we have three options

341
00:20:52,705 --> 00:20:56,910
Number one, a surgical air strike
against the missiles themselves

342
00:20:57,010 --> 00:20:59,212
Two, a much larger air strike
against their air defenses

343
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,350
along with the missiles. And three

344
00:21:04,484 --> 00:21:06,152
invasion

345
00:21:06,252 --> 00:21:09,989
So we're certainly gonna do number one
We're gonna take these missiles out

346
00:21:10,123 --> 00:21:11,457
It seems to me we can't wait very long

347
00:21:11,591 --> 00:21:13,560
We should at leat
be making those preparations

348
00:21:13,660 --> 00:21:14,360
We're preparing to
implement all three options

349
00:21:14,427 --> 00:21:17,997
Though I must stress again, sir
there are risks to the strikes

350
00:21:18,131 --> 00:21:22,202
without the follow-on invasion

351
00:21:22,302 --> 00:21:23,570
You want to be clear, Mr. President

352
00:21:23,703 --> 00:21:26,105
that we've definitely decided
against a political track

353
00:21:28,374 --> 00:21:29,776
Dean

354
00:21:30,910 --> 00:21:34,280
How does this all play out?

355
00:21:34,347 --> 00:21:36,850
Your first step, sir
will be to demand that the Soviet

356
00:21:36,983 --> 00:21:39,719
withdraw the missiles
within 12 to 24 hours

357
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:41,421
The will refuse

358
00:21:41,554 --> 00:21:43,356
When they do
you will order the strikes

359
00:21:43,423 --> 00:21:44,891
followed by the invasion

360
00:21:45,024 --> 00:21:47,527
They will resist and be overrun

361
00:21:47,594 --> 00:21:51,064
They will retaliate against another
target somewhere else in the world

362
00:21:51,164 --> 00:21:52,432
most likely Berlin

363
00:21:52,932 --> 00:21:55,001
We will honor our treaty commitments

364
00:21:55,068 --> 00:21:56,703
and resist them there

365
00:21:56,803 --> 00:21:59,005
defeating them per our plans

366
00:22:00,507 --> 00:22:03,309
Those plans call for
the use of nuclear weapons

367
00:22:08,448 --> 00:22:10,717
So...

368
00:22:10,817 --> 00:22:12,118
what is the next step?

369
00:22:12,218 --> 00:22:14,087
Hopeful cooler heads will prevail

370
00:22:14,187 --> 00:22:16,022
before we reach the next step

371
00:22:20,493 --> 00:22:21,728
Thank you, gentlemen

372
00:22:35,975 --> 00:22:38,111
What happened in there?

373
00:22:38,244 --> 00:22:39,712
I thought he was going to
give us his decision

374
00:22:39,813 --> 00:22:41,614
Look, I know them. They just need to...

375
00:22:41,681 --> 00:22:43,049
make sure there's no other way
They'll get there

376
00:22:43,116 --> 00:22:45,618
The Kennedys' father
was one of the architects of Munich

377
00:22:45,752 --> 00:22:47,921
There's only one
responsible choice here

378
00:22:48,021 --> 00:22:50,657
So let's hope appeasement
doesn't run in families

379
00:22:50,723 --> 00:22:52,492
I fear weakness does

380
00:23:12,212 --> 00:23:14,848
Jesus Christ

381
00:23:18,218 --> 00:23:21,721
Call me Irish, but I don't
believe in cooler heads prevailing

382
00:23:21,855 --> 00:23:23,056
You know, they think I froze in there

383
00:23:23,189 --> 00:23:24,257
You didn't freeze

384
00:23:24,357 --> 00:23:25,458
You did exactly
what you should have done

385
00:23:25,558 --> 00:23:26,960
you stayed out of the corner

386
00:23:27,093 --> 00:23:28,027
You didn't decide

387
00:23:28,161 --> 00:23:30,396
Acheson's scenario is just...

388
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:31,431
unacceptable

389
00:23:31,531 --> 00:23:32,765
And he's got more experience
than anyone

390
00:23:32,866 --> 00:23:34,033
There's no expert on the subject

391
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:37,237
There's no wise old man

392
00:23:37,303 --> 00:23:39,205
Shit, there's just us

393
00:23:39,806 --> 00:23:42,208
Acheson's right

394
00:23:42,275 --> 00:23:44,177
Talk alone is not gonna
accomplish anything

395
00:23:46,079 --> 00:23:47,947
Well, let's bomb the shit out of them

396
00:23:48,414 --> 00:23:49,549
Everybody wants to

397
00:23:49,616 --> 00:23:51,084
Even you

398
00:23:51,217 --> 00:23:52,919
Even me

399
00:23:53,353 --> 00:23:55,188
Right? It sure would feel good

400
00:23:55,688 --> 00:23:56,890
Jack

401
00:23:57,257 --> 00:23:58,358
I'm as conniving as they come

402
00:23:58,458 --> 00:24:01,728
but a sneak attack is just wrong

403
00:24:01,828 --> 00:24:02,996
Things are happening too fast

404
00:24:03,062 --> 00:24:05,398
This is starting to smell like
the Bay of Pigs all over again

405
00:24:05,532 --> 00:24:08,935
Tonight
listening to Taylor and Acheson

406
00:24:09,035 --> 00:24:11,171
I kept seeing Lemnitzer and Dulles

407
00:24:11,237 --> 00:24:12,272
telling me all I had to do was
sign on the dotted line

408
00:24:12,405 --> 00:24:13,373
And that the invasion would succeed

409
00:24:13,540 --> 00:24:16,442
and Castro...

410
00:24:17,110 --> 00:24:18,645
and Castro would be gone

411
00:24:20,413 --> 00:24:21,714
Easy, just like that

412
00:24:27,620 --> 00:24:30,924
There's something...

413
00:24:30,990 --> 00:24:33,259
immoral about
abandoning your own judgment

414
00:24:36,729 --> 00:24:38,631
We just can't let this get out of hand

415
00:24:39,833 --> 00:24:40,934
And we'll do whatever we have to do

416
00:24:41,034 --> 00:24:43,169
to make this come out right

417
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:48,274
I'm gonna stay here tomorrow

418
00:24:48,374 --> 00:24:49,476
You can't

419
00:24:49,609 --> 00:24:51,945
We talked about this. Your schedule?

420
00:24:51,978 --> 00:24:54,881
Best thing you can do tomorrow
is go to Connecticut

421
00:24:55,515 --> 00:24:56,783
He's right

422
00:24:59,686 --> 00:25:01,387
Yeah

423
00:25:01,488 --> 00:25:02,689
Jesus

424
00:25:17,937 --> 00:25:21,040
Doesn't anybody in Connecticut
have to work today?

425
00:25:21,107 --> 00:25:23,409
We love you, JFK

426
00:25:31,484 --> 00:25:33,653
The shole spectrum of air strikes
is the minumum response

427
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:34,854
the Joint Chiefs will accept

428
00:25:34,954 --> 00:25:37,390
No, no, no

429
00:25:37,524 --> 00:25:40,026
There is more than one option here

430
00:25:40,126 --> 00:25:41,094
And if one isn't occurring to us

431
00:25:41,227 --> 00:25:42,862
it's because
we haven't thought hard enough

432
00:25:42,929 --> 00:25:45,899
Bobby, sometimes
there is only one right choice

433
00:25:46,032 --> 00:25:47,600
and you thank God when it's so clear

434
00:25:47,734 --> 00:25:49,602
You're talking about a sneak attack

435
00:25:49,669 --> 00:25:51,638
How would that make us look?

436
00:25:51,671 --> 00:25:54,874
A big country blasting a little one
into the stone age

437
00:25:55,008 --> 00:25:56,276
We'll be everyone's favorites

438
00:25:56,342 --> 00:25:59,412
Come on, Bobby. That's naive

439
00:25:59,479 --> 00:26:01,014
You know that better than anybody

440
00:26:01,181 --> 00:26:03,817
And you weren't
so ethically particular

441
00:26:03,917 --> 00:26:06,519
when we were talking about
options for moving Castro at CIA

442
00:26:18,131 --> 00:26:20,066
Bob

443
00:26:20,099 --> 00:26:22,802
If we go ahead with these air strikes

444
00:26:22,902 --> 00:26:26,105
you know what it'll come to in the end

445
00:26:26,172 --> 00:26:28,174
There has got to be something else

446
00:26:28,241 --> 00:26:29,342
Give it to me

447
00:26:29,476 --> 00:26:34,547
I don't care how crazy, inadequate
or stupid it sounds

448
00:26:34,714 --> 00:26:36,583
Give it to me

449
00:26:37,317 --> 00:26:39,619
Six months ago
we gamed out a scenario

450
00:26:39,752 --> 00:26:41,287
It's slow
It doesn't get rid of the missiles

451
00:26:41,421 --> 00:26:43,723
It's got a lot of drawbacks

452
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:50,330
The scenario
calls for a blockade of Cuba

453
00:27:21,094 --> 00:27:22,962
The situation is worse than we thought

454
00:27:23,029 --> 00:27:25,632
We now count 40 missiles

455
00:27:25,665 --> 00:27:27,767
40 missiles

456
00:27:27,867 --> 00:27:29,002
Longer range IRBM's

457
00:27:29,068 --> 00:27:34,107
They can hit every place
in the country, except Seattle

458
00:27:34,240 --> 00:27:35,942
Mr. President

459
00:27:36,042 --> 00:27:37,710
you give me the order right now

460
00:27:37,844 --> 00:27:41,681
my planes will be ready
to strike in 3 days time

461
00:27:41,815 --> 00:27:43,183
Just say "go"

462
00:27:43,283 --> 00:27:45,652
and my boys
will get those red bastards

463
00:27:47,887 --> 00:27:50,790
General, how long
until the Army's ready?

464
00:27:50,857 --> 00:27:51,858
We've just begun the mobilization

465
00:27:51,958 --> 00:27:54,093
under cover of
a pre-arranged exercise, sir

466
00:27:54,194 --> 00:27:56,162
We're looking at
another week and a half

467
00:27:56,329 --> 00:27:58,832
But you can order the strikes now

468
00:27:59,466 --> 00:28:02,202
The plans call for
an eight day air campaign

469
00:28:02,268 --> 00:28:05,405
It'll light a fire
under the army's ass to get in place

470
00:28:06,339 --> 00:28:08,975
General Lemay, do you truly believe
that's our best course of action?

471
00:28:09,108 --> 00:28:09,676
Mr. President

472
00:28:09,776 --> 00:28:11,878
I believe
it is the only course of action

473
00:28:12,011 --> 00:28:13,913
America is in danger

474
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,115
Those missiles are a threat
to our bomber bases

475
00:28:16,282 --> 00:28:18,184
and the safety of
our nuclear deterrent

476
00:28:18,351 --> 00:28:19,419
Without our deterrent

477
00:28:19,452 --> 00:28:24,157
there's nothing to keep the enemy
from choosing general nuclear war

478
00:28:24,257 --> 00:28:25,458
It's out duty

479
00:28:25,525 --> 00:28:29,062
Our responsibility to the American
people to take out those missiles

480
00:28:29,129 --> 00:28:32,031
and return stability
to the strategic situation

481
00:28:32,165 --> 00:28:34,567
The Big Red Dog
is digging in our back yard

482
00:28:34,701 --> 00:28:36,402
and we are justified in shooting him

483
00:28:36,469 --> 00:28:37,670
Sir

484
00:28:37,770 --> 00:28:41,007
we have a rapidly
closing window of opportunity

485
00:28:41,174 --> 00:28:44,410
where we can to prevent those missiles
from becoming operational

486
00:28:44,544 --> 00:28:46,446
The other options

487
00:28:46,513 --> 00:28:50,316
do not guarantee the end result
that we can guarantee

488
00:28:50,450 --> 00:28:53,086
However, as more time goes by

489
00:28:53,186 --> 00:28:56,256
the less reliable the choice
we can offer you becomes

490
00:28:56,322 --> 00:28:57,190
Mr. President

491
00:28:57,323 --> 00:28:59,526
the motto I chose for SAC

492
00:28:59,626 --> 00:29:01,528
is "Peace is our Profession"

493
00:29:01,594 --> 00:29:04,430
God forbid we find ourselves
in a nuclear exchange

494
00:29:04,464 --> 00:29:06,766
But launched

495
00:29:06,833 --> 00:29:09,002
missiles from Cuba
would kill a lot of Americans

496
00:29:09,102 --> 00:29:10,603
The very presence of those missiles

497
00:29:10,670 --> 00:29:13,072
gives the Soviets
first- strike capability

498
00:29:13,139 --> 00:29:16,409
Those missiles
make a nuclear exchange more likely

499
00:29:16,509 --> 00:29:19,879
And that is why
I'm being such a pain in the ass

500
00:29:20,013 --> 00:29:23,216
abut destroying them
and destroying them immediately

501
00:29:23,316 --> 00:29:25,018
Hell, even Mac agrees

502
00:29:27,086 --> 00:29:28,254
And sir

503
00:29:28,388 --> 00:29:30,924
given your own statements about Cuba

504
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:35,528
I think a blockade
or a bunch of political talk

505
00:29:35,595 --> 00:29:38,231
would be considered
by a lot of our friends and neutrals

506
00:29:38,364 --> 00:29:40,800
as a pretty weak response

507
00:29:40,934 --> 00:29:46,072
And I suspect many of our own citizens
feel the same way

508
00:29:46,606 --> 00:29:51,544
You're in a pretty bad fix
Mr. President

509
00:29:52,745 --> 00:29:54,848
What did you say?

510
00:29:55,949 --> 00:29:57,984
You're in a pretty bad fix

511
00:29:59,619 --> 00:30:02,956
Maybe you hadn't noticed
you're in it with me

512
00:30:05,592 --> 00:30:06,526
General

513
00:30:06,593 --> 00:30:09,796
what are the Soviets gonna do
when we attack?

514
00:30:10,997 --> 00:30:12,232
Nothing

515
00:30:12,866 --> 00:30:13,800
Nothing?

516
00:30:13,900 --> 00:30:15,368
Nothing

517
00:30:15,435 --> 00:30:18,805
Because the only alternative
open to them

518
00:30:18,905 --> 00:30:21,841
is one they can't choose

519
00:30:22,342 --> 00:30:23,843
You know, they're...

520
00:30:24,010 --> 00:30:26,713
they're not just missiles
we're gonna be destroying, General

521
00:30:26,779 --> 00:30:31,351
If we kill Soviet soldiers
they're gonna respond

522
00:30:31,718 --> 00:30:33,486
How would we respond
if they killed ours?

523
00:30:33,620 --> 00:30:34,854
They're gonna do something, General

524
00:30:34,954 --> 00:30:37,457
I can promise you that

525
00:30:40,994 --> 00:30:42,328
Those goddamn Kennedys
are gonna destroy this country

526
00:30:42,462 --> 00:30:45,331
if we don't do something about this

527
00:30:46,900 --> 00:30:50,203
We're headed out to the back yard
to look for that Big Red Dog

528
00:30:51,137 --> 00:30:52,272
Thanks, Bob

529
00:30:52,772 --> 00:30:55,108
I was hoping Lemay pushed you

530
00:30:55,241 --> 00:30:57,610
'Cause I was ready to knock
that son-of-a-bitch across the room

531
00:30:57,710 --> 00:30:58,545
We knew it was coming
And I'll tell you one thing, Kenny

532
00:30:58,645 --> 00:31:00,513
Those brass hats
have one big advantage

533
00:31:00,580 --> 00:31:01,981
That is that
if we do what they want us to do

534
00:31:02,115 --> 00:31:04,150
none of us will be left alive
to tell them they were wrong

535
00:31:04,951 --> 00:31:05,685
Mr. President

536
00:31:05,785 --> 00:31:07,720
we need to go over
what you're going to say

537
00:31:08,254 --> 00:31:09,989
Gromyko should be on his way by now

538
00:31:10,123 --> 00:31:12,525
There's still no sign they know that
we know about the missiles

539
00:31:12,625 --> 00:31:13,927
We're gonna keep it that way

540
00:31:29,809 --> 00:31:31,511
Kenny

541
00:31:31,578 --> 00:31:33,880
Be right there

542
00:31:33,980 --> 00:31:36,049
I'm getting funny questions
from the guys

543
00:31:36,149 --> 00:31:37,884
Yeah? What sort of questions?

544
00:31:37,984 --> 00:31:40,220
About some sort of
"military exercises"?

545
00:31:40,353 --> 00:31:41,254
You want me to do my job
handling the press

546
00:31:41,387 --> 00:31:43,189
I need to know what's going on

547
00:31:43,289 --> 00:31:44,157
Military exercises?

548
00:31:44,224 --> 00:31:46,726
Yeah. Military exercises

549
00:31:46,826 --> 00:31:48,595
Haven't heard anything about it

550
00:31:48,728 --> 00:31:49,395
Ask Bundy

551
00:31:49,462 --> 00:31:51,431
I did. He said to ask you

552
00:31:53,566 --> 00:31:56,035
Mr. Gromyko! This way, please!

553
00:32:01,374 --> 00:32:02,675
Robert

554
00:32:03,209 --> 00:32:04,377
Hugh, how are you?

555
00:32:08,114 --> 00:32:09,115
Excuse me, Joan

556
00:32:09,983 --> 00:32:12,886
So, tell me about this military
exercise going on in Puerto Rico

557
00:32:12,952 --> 00:32:13,553
What?

558
00:32:13,686 --> 00:32:15,989
It's called... ORTSAC, I believe

559
00:32:16,055 --> 00:32:17,657
Castro spelled backwards

560
00:32:17,757 --> 00:32:19,359
ORTSAC?

561
00:32:19,793 --> 00:32:21,394
I don't know what you're talking about

562
00:32:21,461 --> 00:32:22,395
Me either

563
00:32:22,495 --> 00:32:23,429
Why?

564
00:32:23,530 --> 00:32:25,899
Because maybe the President
and Gromyko are gonna talk about it

565
00:32:25,965 --> 00:32:28,535
You're trying to drum something up
Johnny. Forget it

566
00:32:28,635 --> 00:32:30,603
This meeting's been
on the books for months

567
00:32:31,204 --> 00:32:34,274
Far as I know, it's just a friendly
talk on U. S -Soviet relations

568
00:32:38,311 --> 00:32:40,814
Mr. President!
Will you make a statement, sir?

569
00:32:40,947 --> 00:32:42,382
Alright, hold it, fellas

570
00:32:42,448 --> 00:32:44,951
You'll get your pictures

571
00:32:45,051 --> 00:32:46,085
Does it?

572
00:32:48,822 --> 00:32:50,390
I'll be damned

573
00:32:52,192 --> 00:32:53,960
Kind of simple for the Pentagon

574
00:33:04,103 --> 00:33:06,005
Mr. Gromyko

575
00:33:06,105 --> 00:33:08,107
Hold on one minute

576
00:33:12,946 --> 00:33:14,781
Gentlemen
would you mind shaking hands?

577
00:33:16,483 --> 00:33:19,319
So that there should be
no misunderstanding

578
00:33:19,385 --> 00:33:20,787
the position of the United States

579
00:33:20,854 --> 00:33:21,754
which has been made clear
by the Attorney General

580
00:33:21,921 --> 00:33:23,756
to Ambassador Dobrynin here

581
00:33:23,857 --> 00:33:25,091
I shall read a sentence
from my statement

582
00:33:25,258 --> 00:33:27,527
to the press dated September 13th

583
00:33:28,027 --> 00:33:31,898
"Should missiles or offensive weapon
be placed in Cuba"

584
00:33:31,998 --> 00:33:35,135
"it would present the gravest threat
to U. S. national security"

585
00:33:35,268 --> 00:33:36,836
Mr. President

586
00:33:36,970 --> 00:33:40,440
as Premier Kruschev's own statement
of September 13th assured you

587
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:42,075
our military assistance to Cuba

588
00:33:42,208 --> 00:33:44,511
is of a defensive nature only

589
00:33:49,849 --> 00:33:51,818
So I did not misunderstand you?

590
00:33:51,918 --> 00:33:55,054
There are no offensive weapons in Cuba

591
00:33:55,188 --> 00:33:57,957
Premier Kruschev's statement
of September 13th

592
00:33:57,991 --> 00:34:00,660
remains the position
of the Soviet government

593
00:34:00,727 --> 00:34:03,163
To that I have nothing to add

594
00:34:04,197 --> 00:34:05,765
Well, that's good enough for me

595
00:34:06,566 --> 00:34:07,700
Thanks so much

596
00:34:07,801 --> 00:34:09,369
Thank you

597
00:34:11,871 --> 00:34:14,541
Gentlemen
if you'll come with me, please

598
00:34:14,607 --> 00:34:16,309
A most instructive meeting

599
00:34:22,315 --> 00:34:23,216
What happened?

600
00:34:23,316 --> 00:34:24,918
Lying bastard

601
00:34:25,018 --> 00:34:26,085
Lied right to my face

602
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:27,320
We're split down the middle

603
00:34:27,353 --> 00:34:30,256
If I held a vote, I think air strike
would beat blockade by a vote or two

604
00:34:30,323 --> 00:34:33,993
I want a consensus
Either air strike or blockade

605
00:34:34,060 --> 00:34:35,128
Something everyone's gonna stand by

606
00:34:35,261 --> 00:34:37,263
even if they don't like it

607
00:34:37,397 --> 00:34:39,032
And I need it by Saturday

608
00:34:39,065 --> 00:34:40,500
So make it happen

609
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:42,068
What if I can't?

610
00:34:43,436 --> 00:34:46,272
We go into this split
the Russians will know it

611
00:34:46,406 --> 00:34:47,907
And they'll use it against us

612
00:34:47,974 --> 00:34:50,677
Have you cancelled Chicago
and the rest of the weekend yet?

613
00:34:50,777 --> 00:34:53,613
You don't show for Chicago, everyone
will know there's something going on

614
00:34:53,746 --> 00:34:54,848
I don't care. Just cancel it

615
00:34:55,014 --> 00:34:56,883
Forget it

616
00:34:57,750 --> 00:35:00,453
I'm not calling
and canceling on Daley

617
00:35:02,555 --> 00:35:04,624
You call and cancel on Daley

618
00:35:04,757 --> 00:35:06,025
You're scared to cancel on Daley

619
00:35:06,159 --> 00:35:08,394
You're damn right, I'm scared

620
00:35:10,964 --> 00:35:12,899
Well, I'm not

621
00:35:16,202 --> 00:35:17,737
Watch this

622
00:35:19,205 --> 00:35:21,107
Welcome to Chicago, Mr. President

623
00:35:21,141 --> 00:35:23,176
Mr. Mayor, I wouldn't
miss this event for the world

624
00:35:28,181 --> 00:35:29,282
Let's go

625
00:35:29,883 --> 00:35:32,619
Tonight you're going to
experience true Midwest cunning

626
00:35:33,419 --> 00:35:34,287
What's going on?
Now the guys are hounding me

627
00:35:34,420 --> 00:35:36,723
about some sort of troop movements
in Florida

628
00:35:36,790 --> 00:35:37,724
What are you telling them?

629
00:35:37,791 --> 00:35:38,758
The truth. I don't know

630
00:35:38,892 --> 00:35:39,926
Am I out of the loop on something?

631
00:35:40,026 --> 00:35:41,828
No

632
00:35:41,895 --> 00:35:45,398
Tell 'em you've looked into it
and all it is an exercise

633
00:35:46,599 --> 00:35:49,602
And Pierre, tomorrow
the President may have a cold

634
00:35:49,769 --> 00:35:50,503
A what?

635
00:35:50,603 --> 00:35:52,105
A cold

636
00:35:54,274 --> 00:35:56,376
Do I get any input around here?

637
00:35:58,211 --> 00:35:59,546
Yeah

638
00:35:59,646 --> 00:36:01,714
How bad it is, is up to you

639
00:36:09,722 --> 00:36:11,891
There are major rail disruptions
in the south

640
00:36:12,025 --> 00:36:13,993
two airbome divisions are on alert

641
00:36:14,227 --> 00:36:17,330
Sounds to me like that
exercise is an invasion

642
00:36:17,497 --> 00:36:19,866
You know how Bobby has it in
for the state of Mississippi

643
00:36:19,899 --> 00:36:21,401
We're invading Cuba

644
00:36:22,469 --> 00:36:24,804
Dammit, we are not invading Cuba!

645
00:36:24,871 --> 00:36:26,272
Are you crazy?

646
00:36:26,406 --> 00:36:28,475
Nobody gives a rat's ass about Cuba!

647
00:36:28,608 --> 00:36:30,076
Not now, not ever!

648
00:36:30,210 --> 00:36:33,012
If you print that, all you're
gonna do is inflame the situation

649
00:36:33,112 --> 00:36:34,714
And nobody talks to assholes
who inflame situations

650
00:36:34,781 --> 00:36:36,749
Assholes like that

651
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:41,087
can find themselves cut
out of the loop

652
00:36:41,187 --> 00:36:43,590
That's the first time
you've ever threatened me

653
00:36:46,092 --> 00:36:47,160
All right

654
00:36:47,260 --> 00:36:49,362
I won't print anything
until I have another source

655
00:36:49,429 --> 00:36:50,797
But I promise you I'll get one

656
00:36:56,136 --> 00:36:57,003
Bobby?

657
00:36:57,070 --> 00:36:58,838
We've got a consensus for a blockade

658
00:36:58,938 --> 00:37:00,673
but it won't last past tomorrow

659
00:37:00,773 --> 00:37:02,475
You have to bring him back

660
00:37:02,575 --> 00:37:03,309
By the way

661
00:37:03,443 --> 00:37:04,911
China invaded India today

662
00:37:05,044 --> 00:37:05,912
You're kidding, aren't you?

663
00:37:06,012 --> 00:37:07,547
I wish I were

664
00:37:07,647 --> 00:37:10,650
Galbraith's handling it in New Delhi

665
00:37:10,750 --> 00:37:12,585
Makes you wonder what's coming next

666
00:37:12,652 --> 00:37:16,656
What is it about the free world that
pisses the rest of the world off?

667
00:37:16,723 --> 00:37:18,958
I don't know
We have Tupperware parties?

668
00:37:19,726 --> 00:37:20,994
Maybe

669
00:37:21,461 --> 00:37:22,295
I'll see you tomorrow

670
00:37:22,362 --> 00:37:23,329
Okay

671
00:37:23,396 --> 00:37:25,031
The President has a cold

672
00:37:25,098 --> 00:37:27,367
He's canceling
the remainder of this trip

673
00:37:27,467 --> 00:37:29,502
and returning to Washington
on the advice of his doctor

674
00:37:29,602 --> 00:37:31,571
Is that the final word?

675
00:37:35,975 --> 00:37:39,145
President Kennedy!
How do you feel, Mr. President?

676
00:37:48,588 --> 00:37:52,091
Mr. President, our deliberations
have led us to the conclusion

677
00:37:52,158 --> 00:37:56,463
that a blockade of offensive weapons
to Cuba is our best option

678
00:37:56,563 --> 00:37:59,799
A strong showing of support from
the Organization of American States

679
00:37:59,866 --> 00:38:01,401
would give us
an umbrella of legitimacy

680
00:38:01,534 --> 00:38:03,603
A blockade
is technically an act of war

681
00:38:03,670 --> 00:38:06,506
Therefore we recommend
calling the action a quarantine

682
00:38:06,606 --> 00:38:10,443
Let's hope that translates
into Russian the way we want it to

683
00:38:11,478 --> 00:38:13,947
There are between 20...

684
00:38:14,047 --> 00:38:16,282
and 30 Soviet ships
underway to cuba at this time

685
00:38:16,783 --> 00:38:18,284
800 miles out

686
00:38:18,351 --> 00:38:19,853
the navy will stop them

687
00:38:19,986 --> 00:38:20,854
board

688
00:38:20,920 --> 00:38:22,956
and any vessels containing weapons
will be turned back

689
00:38:23,123 --> 00:38:25,892
A quarantine prevents
any more missiles from reaching Cuba

690
00:38:26,025 --> 00:38:28,161
but it doesn't remove
the missiles already there

691
00:38:28,261 --> 00:38:31,898
It gives the Soviets a chance
to pull back without a war

692
00:38:31,931 --> 00:38:33,600
If they refuse to remove the missiles

693
00:38:33,733 --> 00:38:36,636
we retain the option
to strike and invade

694
00:38:36,769 --> 00:38:40,440
A sneak attack is counter to
what the United States stands for

695
00:38:40,540 --> 00:38:42,842
It leaves us no room for maneuver

696
00:38:42,942 --> 00:38:45,812
And the inevitable Soviet response
would force us into a war

697
00:38:45,979 --> 00:38:47,914
Mr. President
there are still those of us

698
00:38:47,981 --> 00:38:50,683
who believe
we should proceed with the strikes

699
00:38:50,850 --> 00:38:54,187
With the blockade
we lose strategic surprise

700
00:38:54,254 --> 00:38:56,856
and we also run the risk of the Soviets
launching the first strike against us

701
00:38:56,923 --> 00:38:59,058
if they decide they have to
use the missiles or lose them

702
00:39:01,961 --> 00:39:03,797
So quarantine...

703
00:39:03,930 --> 00:39:05,598
or air strike

704
00:39:05,698 --> 00:39:08,201
There is a third option

705
00:39:08,701 --> 00:39:13,740
With either course we undertake
the risk of nuclear war

706
00:39:13,873 --> 00:39:18,478
So maybe one of us in this room
should be a coward

707
00:39:19,078 --> 00:39:21,648
So I guess I'll be

708
00:39:21,714 --> 00:39:24,451
A third course is to strike a deal

709
00:39:24,884 --> 00:39:27,754
We trade Guantanamo
and our missiles in Turkey

710
00:39:27,821 --> 00:39:29,522
get them to pull their missiles out

711
00:39:29,656 --> 00:39:31,558
We employ a back channel

712
00:39:31,591 --> 00:39:34,727
We attribute the idea to U. N. Thant

713
00:39:34,828 --> 00:39:37,964
U Thant then raises it at the U. N.

714
00:39:39,732 --> 00:39:42,202
I don't think that's possible, Adlai

715
00:39:45,338 --> 00:39:47,307
I've not yet made my final decision

716
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:50,210
I'll be asking the networks
for airtime on Monday night

717
00:39:50,276 --> 00:39:52,545
We'll announce
our course of action then

718
00:39:54,180 --> 00:39:57,117
Ted, get to work on speeches
for both quarantine

719
00:39:57,183 --> 00:39:58,785
and air strike

720
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:02,255
Thank you for all your advice
gentlemen

721
00:40:03,823 --> 00:40:05,658
Did you hear Adlai?

722
00:40:05,725 --> 00:40:08,428
You'd think nobody
learned anything from World War Two

723
00:40:08,528 --> 00:40:09,762
Somebody had to say it

724
00:40:09,863 --> 00:40:12,532
I respect Adlai for having the guts
to risk looking like an appeaser

725
00:40:12,632 --> 00:40:13,933
We have to pull him

726
00:40:14,033 --> 00:40:17,237
He won't be able to handle
the Soviets in front of the U. N.

727
00:40:17,370 --> 00:40:18,071
Zorin will eat him alive

728
00:40:18,138 --> 00:40:19,706
We've got bigger problems right now

729
00:40:20,907 --> 00:40:22,108
Ladies?

730
00:40:22,208 --> 00:40:23,376
No, thank you

731
00:40:27,514 --> 00:40:29,382
Honey, I'll be right back

732
00:40:37,257 --> 00:40:38,458
Adlai

733
00:40:40,960 --> 00:40:43,563
Just can't seem to
get away from you guys

734
00:40:43,663 --> 00:40:45,799
Escaping from a night on the town?

735
00:40:45,865 --> 00:40:47,734
As D. C. 's most popular playboy

736
00:40:47,834 --> 00:40:50,637
the President felt my presence
would be sorely missed, so...

737
00:40:50,770 --> 00:40:53,773
in the interest of National Security

738
00:40:53,807 --> 00:40:55,275
here I am

739
00:40:55,375 --> 00:40:57,544
Yes. Gotta keep up appearances

740
00:40:57,644 --> 00:40:59,879
Of course, I don't any more

741
00:41:01,347 --> 00:41:03,216
I'm a political dead man

742
00:41:03,616 --> 00:41:07,454
Did you ever see anyone
cut his own throat like I did today?

743
00:41:08,688 --> 00:41:10,690
No

744
00:41:10,790 --> 00:41:12,325
It's alright

745
00:41:12,425 --> 00:41:13,359
By the way

746
00:41:13,493 --> 00:41:15,361
I spoke to a friend

747
00:41:15,428 --> 00:41:17,597
Reston and Frankel have the story

748
00:41:17,664 --> 00:41:20,066
The Times is going to run it tomorrow

749
00:41:22,769 --> 00:41:24,404
We're not gonna make it to Monday

750
00:41:24,537 --> 00:41:25,338
Shit

751
00:41:25,472 --> 00:41:27,373
I'll get Sorenson
to try to lean on Reston

752
00:41:27,540 --> 00:41:29,676
But you're gonna
have to call Orville Dryfoos

753
00:41:29,809 --> 00:41:32,412
This is the sort of decision
a publisher makes himself

754
00:41:32,846 --> 00:41:34,214
Alright

755
00:41:34,280 --> 00:41:36,116
Thanks, Kenny

756
00:41:37,117 --> 00:41:38,184
Yes sir, I understand

757
00:41:38,284 --> 00:41:40,320
But we held on the Bay of Pigs

758
00:41:40,420 --> 00:41:41,788
and it was the
biggest mistake of my life

759
00:41:41,855 --> 00:41:42,622
What makes this different?

760
00:41:42,722 --> 00:41:43,723
Orville, I'm asking you
to hold the story

761
00:41:43,890 --> 00:41:47,293
until I can present
our course of action on Monday night

762
00:41:49,729 --> 00:41:50,330
Alright

763
00:41:50,463 --> 00:41:52,365
But I'm gonna need a reason
to give my boys

764
00:41:52,499 --> 00:41:53,833
They're gonna be screaming
for my head on a plate

765
00:41:53,967 --> 00:41:56,436
Orville, you tell them this

766
00:41:56,503 --> 00:41:58,438
That they'll be saving lives

767
00:41:58,605 --> 00:42:00,440
including their own

768
00:42:02,408 --> 00:42:04,043
Yes, Mr. President

769
00:42:30,737 --> 00:42:32,772
How many Congressmen
have not responded yet?

770
00:42:32,872 --> 00:42:34,207
Fourteen

771
00:42:34,641 --> 00:42:36,543
Boggs is in the Gulf fishing?

772
00:42:36,609 --> 00:42:38,678
I thought
he was supposed to be campaigning

773
00:42:38,745 --> 00:42:39,846
He's not gone for long, sir

774
00:42:39,913 --> 00:42:42,949
Jesus. Get a plane out there
and get him back

775
00:42:44,484 --> 00:42:46,286
He wants to talk to LeMay again

776
00:42:46,653 --> 00:42:48,021
He's still considering air strikes

777
00:42:57,897 --> 00:42:59,566
None of this works tomorrow

778
00:42:59,632 --> 00:43:00,834
Figure out how to cancel it

779
00:43:00,900 --> 00:43:02,135
Yes, sir

780
00:43:03,937 --> 00:43:05,905
We're on the phones

781
00:43:15,081 --> 00:43:17,784
Cam, can you guarantee me
you'll get all the missiles?

782
00:43:21,387 --> 00:43:23,823
Sir, I guarantee we'll get
all the missiles we know about

783
00:43:23,923 --> 00:43:24,858
Mr. President

784
00:43:24,991 --> 00:43:27,293
we can get better than
90 percent of them

785
00:43:31,498 --> 00:43:34,601
I'll brief the Congressional
leadership tomorrow evening at five

786
00:43:36,069 --> 00:43:39,372
At seven o'clock, all United States
armed forces worldwide

787
00:43:39,506 --> 00:43:41,341
will stand up to DEFCON 3

788
00:43:42,475 --> 00:43:44,711
I have a brief statement

789
00:43:44,811 --> 00:43:46,880
President Kennedy
will address the nation tonight

790
00:43:47,013 --> 00:43:48,515
On radio and television

791
00:43:48,648 --> 00:43:51,684
on a subject of
the hightest national urgency

792
00:43:51,751 --> 00:43:54,687
He has requested airtime
on all three networks for seven p. m.

793
00:43:54,821 --> 00:43:55,855
Thank you very much

794
00:44:25,718 --> 00:44:26,953
Mr. President

795
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:32,025
Congress cannot give you
the support you're looking for

796
00:44:32,158 --> 00:44:32,759
Mr. President?

797
00:44:32,859 --> 00:44:33,893
Sir?

798
00:44:33,993 --> 00:44:36,429
If they want this goddamn job
they can have it

799
00:44:36,529 --> 00:44:37,897
It's no great joy to me

800
00:44:37,964 --> 00:44:39,999
Mr. President, here's the speech
with those changes you wanted

801
00:44:40,133 --> 00:44:40,800
I need a minute

802
00:44:40,900 --> 00:44:41,968
Kenny, no

803
00:44:42,068 --> 00:44:43,837
A minute

804
00:44:48,808 --> 00:44:50,443
I don't want a goddamn pep talk

805
00:44:50,577 --> 00:44:52,345
You're not the Harvard
quarterback anymore

806
00:44:52,879 --> 00:44:54,414
We're on the brink here

807
00:44:54,481 --> 00:44:56,883
They're trying to second-guess me
into World War Three

808
00:44:56,983 --> 00:44:57,884
Well, it's not gonna happen

809
00:44:57,951 --> 00:44:59,085
What did you think
Congress was gonna do?

810
00:44:59,219 --> 00:45:02,255
Offer you unconditional support?

811
00:45:02,355 --> 00:45:04,424
Kiss your Catholic ass?

812
00:45:04,858 --> 00:45:06,493
They don't think
we even deserve to be here

813
00:45:06,826 --> 00:45:08,228
What the hell do you think?

814
00:45:08,695 --> 00:45:10,430
I think we haven't been
that impressive to date

815
00:45:10,563 --> 00:45:12,632
and they have good reason
to question our judgment

816
00:45:13,099 --> 00:45:14,934
What do you want, Kenny?

817
00:45:15,802 --> 00:45:16,469
I want you to sit down

818
00:45:16,569 --> 00:45:18,071
I'm not gonna sit down

819
00:45:19,072 --> 00:45:20,440
I want you to sit down

820
00:45:20,540 --> 00:45:21,875
loosen your tie
and take a minute for yourself

821
00:45:21,941 --> 00:45:22,909
I haven't got a minute!

822
00:45:23,009 --> 00:45:25,912
You're the President
of the United States

823
00:45:26,012 --> 00:45:28,481
They can wait for you

824
00:45:33,253 --> 00:45:34,921
Why not

825
00:45:37,957 --> 00:45:39,359
Things can't get much worse

826
00:45:39,459 --> 00:45:41,628
We could have to...

827
00:45:41,761 --> 00:45:44,931
go down to Lyndon's ranch again
dressed up as cowboys

828
00:45:47,333 --> 00:45:50,170
Shoot deer
out of the back of his convertible

829
00:45:52,272 --> 00:45:54,207
That was a bad day

830
00:45:57,477 --> 00:46:02,081
You know
I thought there'd be ore good days

831
00:46:04,417 --> 00:46:06,619
You know
back when we were in the wards

832
00:46:07,353 --> 00:46:09,689
the day Bobby
made me come down to meet you

833
00:46:10,824 --> 00:46:12,659
I didn't get you at first

834
00:46:13,726 --> 00:46:15,161
I thought you were lucky

835
00:46:16,262 --> 00:46:17,630
Your father had a lot of money

836
00:46:18,498 --> 00:46:19,699
You were skinny

837
00:46:20,266 --> 00:46:22,135
Girls loved you

838
00:46:22,869 --> 00:46:25,805
I thought I could
beat you and Bobby up together

839
00:46:26,706 --> 00:46:28,007
But he...

840
00:46:28,575 --> 00:46:32,545
just kept going on and on about you

841
00:46:33,079 --> 00:46:35,482
I thought it was
because he was your brother

842
00:46:38,718 --> 00:46:40,820
But I was wrong

843
00:46:43,456 --> 00:46:44,991
I was wrong

844
00:47:02,709 --> 00:47:04,511
You sleeping?

845
00:47:05,345 --> 00:47:07,380
No, not much

846
00:47:08,014 --> 00:47:10,483
I slept last night, though

847
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:15,155
And when I woke up

848
00:47:15,221 --> 00:47:19,259
I'd forgotten that
all this had happened

849
00:47:19,993 --> 00:47:21,928
And then I remembered

850
00:47:22,061 --> 00:47:27,200
and I just wished for
a second somebody else was President

851
00:47:28,234 --> 00:47:29,869
You mean that?

852
00:47:31,471 --> 00:47:33,506
I said for a second

853
00:47:39,512 --> 00:47:43,283
Boy, there is
a lot of noise out there, Kenny

854
00:47:47,520 --> 00:47:49,756
You know what you're doing
Mr. President

855
00:47:51,324 --> 00:47:53,460
You're gonna make
the best call you can

856
00:47:53,526 --> 00:47:54,961
And you know
they're gonna second-guess you

857
00:47:55,028 --> 00:47:56,563
So what?

858
00:47:58,131 --> 00:48:00,733
We're just gonna have to
take our beatings as we go

859
00:48:06,406 --> 00:48:08,074
So what are we gonna do now?

860
00:48:10,009 --> 00:48:11,344
I'm going on TV

861
00:48:20,620 --> 00:48:22,922
Maybe the American people
will go with me

862
00:48:24,457 --> 00:48:26,292
Even if their...

863
00:48:27,494 --> 00:48:30,029
elected representatives won't

864
00:48:35,568 --> 00:48:37,971
You wear something nice for the TV

865
00:48:38,037 --> 00:48:39,572
Make sure Jackie picks it

866
00:48:45,779 --> 00:48:47,914
Excuse me

867
00:48:51,818 --> 00:48:53,820
Okay, everybody. I think we're ready

868
00:48:57,123 --> 00:48:58,558
No. I'm fine

869
00:48:59,993 --> 00:49:01,461
Mr. President, in five...

870
00:49:01,561 --> 00:49:04,831
four... three... two...

871
00:49:04,931 --> 00:49:06,966
Good evening, my fellow citizens

872
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,102
This government, as promised

873
00:49:09,235 --> 00:49:11,271
has maintained
the closest surveillance

874
00:49:11,404 --> 00:49:14,741
of the Soviet military build-up
on the island of Cuba

875
00:49:14,808 --> 00:49:16,376
Within the past week

876
00:49:16,443 --> 00:49:18,044
unmistakable evidence
has established the fact

877
00:49:18,144 --> 00:49:22,215
that a series of
offensive missile sites

878
00:49:22,282 --> 00:49:25,318
is now in preparation
on that imprisoned island

879
00:49:25,418 --> 00:49:27,554
The purpose of these bases
can be none other than to provide

880
00:49:27,620 --> 00:49:29,222
a nuclear strike capability

881
00:49:29,289 --> 00:49:32,592
against the Western Hemisphere

882
00:49:32,659 --> 00:49:35,295
Acting therefore
in the defense of our own security

883
00:49:35,328 --> 00:49:38,031
and under the authority entrusted
to me by the Constitution

884
00:49:38,164 --> 00:49:42,202
I have directed that the following
initial steps be taken immediately

885
00:49:42,235 --> 00:49:43,103
First

886
00:49:43,203 --> 00:49:45,205
to halt this offensive build-up

887
00:49:45,338 --> 00:49:47,740
a strict quarantine on
all offensive military equipment

888
00:49:47,907 --> 00:49:50,110
under shipment to Cuba
is being initiated

889
00:49:50,176 --> 00:49:52,912
All ships of any kind bound for Cuba

890
00:49:52,979 --> 00:49:54,948
form whatever nation or port

891
00:49:55,014 --> 00:49:58,785
will, if found to contain cargoes
of offensive weapons, be turned back

892
00:49:58,818 --> 00:49:59,652
Second

893
00:49:59,719 --> 00:50:02,522
I have directed
the continued and increased

894
00:50:02,655 --> 00:50:04,457
close surveillance of Cuba
and its military build-up

895
00:50:04,591 --> 00:50:06,860
Should these military
preparations continue

896
00:50:06,993 --> 00:50:09,062
further action will be justified

897
00:50:09,229 --> 00:50:12,766
I have directed the Armed Forces
to prepare for any eventualities

898
00:50:12,866 --> 00:50:13,900
And third

899
00:50:14,067 --> 00:50:16,236
It shall be the policy of this nation

900
00:50:16,336 --> 00:50:18,671
to regard any nuclear missile
launched from Cuba

901
00:50:18,738 --> 00:50:23,176
against any nation in the
Western Hemisphere as an attack

902
00:50:23,309 --> 00:50:25,078
by the Soviet Union
on the United States

903
00:50:25,211 --> 00:50:28,615
requiring a full retaliatory response
upon the Soviet Union

904
00:50:37,590 --> 00:50:38,992
Good speech, Teddy

905
00:50:39,526 --> 00:50:41,961
I guess I get to keep my job

906
00:50:44,264 --> 00:50:45,432
No

907
00:50:45,532 --> 00:50:47,634
It was a really good speech

908
00:50:47,734 --> 00:50:50,603
I can't imagine what you did
with the air strikes version

909
00:50:54,607 --> 00:50:56,075
I wasn't able to write, Kenny

910
00:50:58,711 --> 00:51:01,881
It's kind of hard
to write the unthinkable

911
00:51:01,981 --> 00:51:05,552
I tried, I just...

912
00:51:07,454 --> 00:51:10,790
I couldn't

913
00:51:12,892 --> 00:51:14,794
We're getting the Soviet response

914
00:51:14,894 --> 00:51:16,563
It's coming in on the teletype

915
00:51:18,064 --> 00:51:19,499
"The community of nations recognizes"

916
00:51:19,599 --> 00:51:22,001
"the fundamental right
of freedom of the seas... "

917
00:51:22,035 --> 00:51:23,570
THis is horseshit

918
00:51:24,270 --> 00:51:25,371
I agree

919
00:51:32,112 --> 00:51:34,647
They don't know how to respond yet

920
00:51:35,648 --> 00:51:37,951
So now you're Kruschev

921
00:51:38,017 --> 00:51:39,552
What do you do?

922
00:51:43,890 --> 00:51:46,559
You run the blockade

923
00:51:46,626 --> 00:51:47,660
They'll run the blockade

924
00:51:47,727 --> 00:51:51,397
Which is what they appear to
be preparing to do, Mr. President

925
00:51:51,431 --> 00:51:54,167
We're tracking 26 ships
inbound for Cuba

926
00:51:54,234 --> 00:51:56,603
They show no sign of changing course

927
00:51:56,703 --> 00:51:59,139
The closest ships
the Gagarin and the Kimovsk

928
00:51:59,205 --> 00:52:01,775
will make the quarantine line
by this time tomorrow

929
00:52:01,875 --> 00:52:04,711
Admiral Anderson
if the ships do not stop

930
00:52:04,811 --> 00:52:07,580
exactly what are
our rules of engagement?

931
00:52:07,580 --> 00:52:10,884
Russian- speaking personnel
have been transferred to our ships

932
00:52:10,950 --> 00:52:12,886
When the quarantine
takes place in the morning

933
00:52:12,886 --> 00:52:16,389
our ships will attempt radio contact
with approaching vessels

934
00:52:16,556 --> 00:52:20,193
They'll be ordered to reduce speed
and stand by for inspection

935
00:52:20,260 --> 00:52:23,263
An inspection team will then
board and search the vessel

936
00:52:23,329 --> 00:52:26,566
If weapons are found, the ship will be
ordered out of the quarantine area

937
00:52:26,666 --> 00:52:27,801
If they refuse

938
00:52:27,967 --> 00:52:29,669
they'll be towed into the nearest port

939
00:52:29,769 --> 00:52:33,206
What if the ship doesn't stop
for inspection or want to be towed?

940
00:52:33,273 --> 00:52:35,241
We fire a warning shot
across their bow

941
00:52:35,341 --> 00:52:37,944
And what happens
if the ship ignores the warning shot?

942
00:52:38,044 --> 00:52:40,146
Wen then fire at its rudder

943
00:52:40,280 --> 00:52:41,648
disable it
and carry on our inspection

944
00:52:41,781 --> 00:52:45,151
There will be no shooting
without my explicit orders

945
00:52:45,185 --> 00:52:46,786
Is that understood?

946
00:52:46,886 --> 00:52:48,221
Yes sir

947
00:52:48,321 --> 00:52:50,156
Well, Admiral
looks like it's up to the navy

948
00:52:50,223 --> 00:52:52,025
The navy won't let you down, sir

949
00:52:52,058 --> 00:52:53,760
There is one other thing
Mr. President

950
00:52:53,827 --> 00:52:57,130
We're commencing low-level photography
runs over Cuba this morning

951
00:52:57,263 --> 00:52:59,899
It'll be more detailed
than the U-2 photography

952
00:53:00,033 --> 00:53:03,169
We'll firm up our estimates
of the missiles' readiness

953
00:53:03,269 --> 00:53:06,739
and develop target packages for strikes
if you should order them, sir

954
00:53:06,806 --> 00:53:07,574
To protect our pilots

955
00:53:07,640 --> 00:53:10,143
we're prepared to retaliate
against any SAM site

956
00:53:10,310 --> 00:53:12,545
or anti-aircraft battery
that may open fire

957
00:53:12,579 --> 00:53:14,114
We have a flight of Thunderchiefs
that'll be able to

958
00:53:14,180 --> 00:53:17,717
respond within minutes
to any attacks on our planes

959
00:53:25,458 --> 00:53:26,693
I've got a bad feeling about
what's going on in there

960
00:53:26,826 --> 00:53:28,261
In the morning

961
00:53:28,394 --> 00:53:30,330
I'm taking charge of the blockade
from the situation room

962
00:53:30,463 --> 00:53:32,899
And McNamara is gonna set up shop
in the flag plot at the Pentagon

963
00:53:32,999 --> 00:53:33,433
He'll keep an eye on things there

964
00:53:33,533 --> 00:53:34,234
Good

965
00:53:34,300 --> 00:53:36,569
You get armed boarders
climbing on the Soviet ships

966
00:53:36,636 --> 00:53:38,371
with shots being fired across bows

967
00:53:38,471 --> 00:53:39,906
What about these low-level flights?

968
00:53:39,973 --> 00:53:40,573
We need the flights

969
00:53:40,707 --> 00:53:41,374
They're starting in what?

970
00:53:41,441 --> 00:53:43,076
An hour

971
00:53:43,143 --> 00:53:44,711
Do you realize what you're in for?

972
00:53:44,778 --> 00:53:46,279
We need the flights

973
00:53:46,412 --> 00:53:47,680
because the minute that
first missile becomes operational

974
00:53:47,781 --> 00:53:48,748
we gotta go in there and destroy them

975
00:53:48,815 --> 00:53:50,750
Fair enough. But Castro's on alert

976
00:53:50,850 --> 00:53:54,554
and we're flying attack planes
over their sites on the deck

977
00:53:55,054 --> 00:53:58,525
There's no way for them to know
we're carrying cameras, not bombs

978
00:53:58,591 --> 00:53:59,125
They're going to be shot at

979
00:53:59,225 --> 00:54:01,161
plain and simple

980
00:54:02,629 --> 00:54:04,664
I'm your political advisor

981
00:54:04,731 --> 00:54:08,301
I'm giving you a political analysis

982
00:54:08,401 --> 00:54:10,170
This is a set-up

983
00:54:10,804 --> 00:54:12,806
The Chiefs want to go in

984
00:54:12,872 --> 00:54:15,575
They need to redeem themselves
for the Bay of Pigs

985
00:54:15,708 --> 00:54:17,811
They gotta go in this time
and do it right

986
00:54:18,545 --> 00:54:20,246
I'm gonna protect those pilots

987
00:54:22,315 --> 00:54:24,851
They're boxing us in
with these rules of engagement

988
00:54:24,951 --> 00:54:26,553
If you agree and
one of our planes gets knocked down

989
00:54:26,653 --> 00:54:28,121
or one of the ships
won't stop fro inspection

990
00:54:28,221 --> 00:54:29,756
the Chiefs will have us by the balls

991
00:54:29,856 --> 00:54:31,991
and will force us to start shooting

992
00:54:32,091 --> 00:54:33,993
They want a war

993
00:54:37,297 --> 00:54:41,367
and they're arranging thing to get one

994
00:54:43,703 --> 00:54:45,338
How does a man get to a place

995
00:54:45,405 --> 00:54:49,542
where he can say
"Throw those lives away" so easily?

996
00:54:49,676 --> 00:54:51,411
Maybe it's harder for them
to say than they let on

997
00:54:51,478 --> 00:54:52,212
but at the very least

998
00:54:52,278 --> 00:54:55,181
they believe it's in our best interest

999
00:54:55,281 --> 00:54:57,383
And you know what?

1000
00:54:57,517 --> 00:55:00,086
At the end of the day they may well

1001
00:55:00,220 --> 00:55:01,721
end up being right

1002
00:55:06,826 --> 00:55:07,560
I'll tell you one thing

1003
00:55:07,627 --> 00:55:09,095
We have to triple-check

1004
00:55:09,229 --> 00:55:13,633
everything the Chiefs say to us
with the guys that actually do it

1005
00:55:13,733 --> 00:55:14,601
And nobody's to know about this

1006
00:55:14,701 --> 00:55:16,369
but Bobby

1007
00:55:16,469 --> 00:55:19,105
I need redundant control over
what happens out there

1008
00:55:19,205 --> 00:55:20,173
If things aren't advertised

1009
00:55:20,240 --> 00:55:21,174
then you are gonna make sure
they come out the way I want

1010
00:55:21,274 --> 00:55:24,544
Starting with
this low-level flight thing

1011
00:55:25,011 --> 00:55:26,112
That's gonna be tough

1012
00:55:26,246 --> 00:55:28,815
You know how these guys are
about their chains of command

1013
00:55:29,382 --> 00:55:30,884
Listen, tell them
those chains of command

1014
00:55:30,950 --> 00:55:32,719
end at one place - me

1015
00:55:35,855 --> 00:55:37,190
Go ahead, sir

1016
00:55:37,357 --> 00:55:38,892
Speak up, lady. I cannot hear you

1017
00:55:39,025 --> 00:55:42,429
I got a train to catch
and I'd like to be home by Christmas

1018
00:55:42,562 --> 00:55:43,963
That's the one

1019
00:55:44,063 --> 00:55:44,998
What's her name?

1020
00:55:45,131 --> 00:55:46,232
Margaret

1021
00:55:47,233 --> 00:55:48,568
Margaret

1022
00:55:50,470 --> 00:55:52,338
Yes sir, I understand exactly
what you're talking about

1023
00:55:52,439 --> 00:55:53,773
I speak the language, too

1024
00:55:53,840 --> 00:55:54,774
What?

1025
00:55:54,841 --> 00:55:56,943
Margaret, would you mind
helping me with something?

1026
00:55:57,043 --> 00:55:58,812
What do you need, honey?

1027
00:55:58,912 --> 00:56:00,980
That tone of voice, specifically

1028
00:56:02,582 --> 00:56:04,918
What tone of voice?
What the hell is he talking about?

1029
00:56:05,051 --> 00:56:07,086
I told you, sir
I'm sorry, you're outta here

1030
00:56:12,625 --> 00:56:14,127
Ready Room

1031
00:56:14,561 --> 00:56:16,196
Skipper. What are you doing?

1032
00:56:16,329 --> 00:56:17,430
Looking out the door

1033
00:56:17,497 --> 00:56:18,498
I'll get him for you

1034
00:56:18,565 --> 00:56:19,365
At what?

1035
00:56:19,466 --> 00:56:20,200
Cuba

1036
00:56:20,333 --> 00:56:21,634
Skipper!

1037
00:56:21,734 --> 00:56:22,969
Telephone

1038
00:56:29,175 --> 00:56:29,843
Commander Ecker

1039
00:56:29,976 --> 00:56:30,944
Commander Ecker

1040
00:56:31,111 --> 00:56:32,812
This is the White House Operator

1041
00:56:32,912 --> 00:56:33,746
Please hold

1042
00:56:33,813 --> 00:56:34,814
Shit

1043
00:56:34,914 --> 00:56:38,017
Honey, you don't know what shit is

1044
00:56:38,685 --> 00:56:40,019
Commander

1045
00:56:40,086 --> 00:56:41,521
my name's Ken O'Donnell

1046
00:56:41,621 --> 00:56:43,256
Special Assistant to the President

1047
00:56:43,423 --> 00:56:44,324
Yes, sir

1048
00:56:44,457 --> 00:56:47,527
The Presiden'ts instructed me
to pass along an order to you

1049
00:56:47,627 --> 00:56:50,396
You are not to get shot down

1050
00:56:51,030 --> 00:56:52,365
We'll do our best, sir

1051
00:56:52,499 --> 00:56:54,300
I don't think
you understand me, Commander

1052
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,202
You are not to get shot down

1053
00:56:56,269 --> 00:56:57,604
under any circumstances

1054
00:56:58,772 --> 00:56:59,572
Whatever happens up there

1055
00:56:59,606 --> 00:57:00,807
you were not shot at

1056
00:57:00,874 --> 00:57:02,308
Mechanical failures are fine

1057
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:04,310
crashing into mountains, fine

1058
00:57:04,410 --> 00:57:08,181
You are not to be shot at, fired at

1059
00:57:08,248 --> 00:57:09,649
or launched upon

1060
00:57:09,749 --> 00:57:12,252
Excuse me, sir
What the hell is going on here?

1061
00:57:12,352 --> 00:57:14,154
Commander, if you are fired upon

1062
00:57:14,254 --> 00:57:17,190
the President will be forced to
attack the sites that fired upon you

1063
00:57:17,624 --> 00:57:18,992
He doesn't want to have to do that

1064
00:57:19,526 --> 00:57:21,828
It's very important that he doesn't

1065
00:57:21,928 --> 00:57:23,663
or things could go
very badly out of control

1066
00:57:23,730 --> 00:57:25,231
What about my men?

1067
00:57:25,365 --> 00:57:27,600
If we don't have anybody to protect us

1068
00:57:27,700 --> 00:57:28,935
I'm gonna be writing
letters home for parents

1069
00:57:29,068 --> 00:57:30,503
If the President
protects you, Commander

1070
00:57:30,603 --> 00:57:34,107
he may have to do it with the Bomb

1071
00:57:34,707 --> 00:57:37,911
I've known the man for fifteen years
The problem is

1072
00:57:38,044 --> 00:57:39,946
he will protect you

1073
00:57:40,079 --> 00:57:43,216
So I'm asking you
don't make him protect you

1074
00:57:43,316 --> 00:57:45,018
Don't get shot at

1075
00:57:45,952 --> 00:57:48,655
Okay, Mr. O'Donnell
We'll do what we can

1076
00:57:49,289 --> 00:57:50,723
I know you will

1077
00:57:51,758 --> 00:57:53,393
Good luck

1078
00:58:01,267 --> 00:58:02,368
Hey, Joey

1079
00:58:16,649 --> 00:58:17,050
See you, Joey

1080
00:58:17,150 --> 00:58:18,685
Thanks, Joey

1081
00:58:18,751 --> 00:58:20,587
There you go, Jeremy

1082
00:58:20,653 --> 00:58:21,387
Hey, Bruce

1083
00:58:21,454 --> 00:58:22,856
Skipper?

1084
00:58:22,989 --> 00:58:24,357
Never mind. Just do what I do

1085
00:58:24,491 --> 00:58:25,859
Hand signs only

1086
00:58:38,238 --> 00:58:39,005
You are clear

1087
00:58:39,072 --> 00:58:40,106
Ready to go, sir

1088
00:58:40,173 --> 00:58:41,741
Good luck, Skipper

1089
01:00:54,441 --> 01:00:55,775
Shit!

1090
01:00:55,842 --> 01:00:57,310
Did you see it?

1091
01:01:00,280 --> 01:01:01,714
Man! You were lucky, Skipper!

1092
01:01:01,781 --> 01:01:03,450
Danm sparrows

1093
01:01:03,550 --> 01:01:04,918
Musta been migrating

1094
01:01:05,018 --> 01:01:05,819
Sparrows?

1095
01:01:05,919 --> 01:01:07,253
Probably hit a couple hundred of them

1096
01:01:07,353 --> 01:01:08,721
How many did you hit, Bruce?

1097
01:01:08,822 --> 01:01:10,857
Sparrows?

1098
01:01:13,259 --> 01:01:15,061
A few, I guess

1099
01:01:15,528 --> 01:01:17,630
These 20 millimeter
or 40 millimeter sparrows, sir?

1100
01:01:17,730 --> 01:01:19,399
Those are bird strikes

1101
01:01:19,532 --> 01:01:21,868
Sparrows, to be precise

1102
01:01:22,335 --> 01:01:23,903
That's the way it is, guys

1103
01:01:24,637 --> 01:01:26,239
Get that film packed up!

1104
01:01:30,877 --> 01:01:31,911
Commander Ecker

1105
01:01:31,978 --> 01:01:32,579
Hello?

1106
01:01:32,679 --> 01:01:33,313
Sir

1107
01:01:33,413 --> 01:01:34,013
Commander

1108
01:01:34,080 --> 01:01:35,315
Mr. O'Donnell, I've been ordered

1109
01:01:35,415 --> 01:01:37,717
to deliver the film
to the Pentagon personally

1110
01:01:37,784 --> 01:01:39,085
What's going on here?

1111
01:01:39,219 --> 01:01:41,855
The Chiefs must wanna talk to you

1112
01:01:42,288 --> 01:01:44,157
They're gonna want to know
if you were fired on

1113
01:01:44,290 --> 01:01:45,125
Were you?

1114
01:01:45,258 --> 01:01:47,293
You could say that, sir

1115
01:01:51,064 --> 01:01:53,099
Commander, listen to me

1116
01:01:53,166 --> 01:01:57,971
I know this must fly in the face
of everything you've come to serve

1117
01:01:58,004 --> 01:02:01,007
but I'm asking you to look
through this to the other side

1118
01:02:04,110 --> 01:02:06,045
Commander William B. Ecker
reporting as ordered

1119
01:02:06,112 --> 01:02:06,946
Commander

1120
01:02:07,013 --> 01:02:07,814
Sir

1121
01:02:07,947 --> 01:02:09,516
Put your gear down over here

1122
01:02:10,817 --> 01:02:12,419
Would you like
a glass of water or anything?

1123
01:02:12,552 --> 01:02:13,820
No, thank you, sir

1124
01:02:14,888 --> 01:02:15,455
Sir

1125
01:02:15,588 --> 01:02:16,156
Ecker

1126
01:02:16,256 --> 01:02:18,158
Have a seat

1127
01:02:21,060 --> 01:02:23,329
Commander
I assume you know why you're here

1128
01:02:23,463 --> 01:02:24,397
Son

1129
01:02:24,531 --> 01:02:26,733
I wanna know just one thing

1130
01:02:26,833 --> 01:02:30,103
Did those bastards shoot so much
as a BB gun at you?

1131
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:34,674
It was a cakewalk, sir

1132
01:02:36,709 --> 01:02:37,377
Mr. President

1133
01:02:37,510 --> 01:02:39,846
The OAS meeting starts
in less than an hour

1134
01:02:39,946 --> 01:02:41,848
Good. I think we need this one. Dean

1135
01:02:41,981 --> 01:02:43,850
We can't expect miracles

1136
01:02:43,950 --> 01:02:47,687
The quarantine is legal
if we get a mandate

1137
01:02:47,821 --> 01:02:49,389
Otherwise it's an act of war
in the eyes of the world

1138
01:02:49,522 --> 01:02:51,257
So you gotta get me the vote

1139
01:02:51,357 --> 01:02:52,492
And make it unanimous

1140
01:02:52,625 --> 01:02:54,027
Mr. President
the Organization of American States

1141
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,228
hasn't had a unanimous vote since...

1142
01:02:55,328 --> 01:02:57,163
Unanimous, Dean

1143
01:03:23,490 --> 01:03:25,458
In accordance
with this afternoon's vote

1144
01:03:25,558 --> 01:03:27,660
at the Organization of American States

1145
01:03:27,761 --> 01:03:30,029
the quarantine
will hereby be effective

1146
01:03:30,163 --> 01:03:32,165
as of ten o'clock tomorrow morning

1147
01:03:48,281 --> 01:03:49,349
At eight a. m. this morning

1148
01:03:49,482 --> 01:03:51,618
the United States

1149
01:03:51,684 --> 01:03:54,521
detonated a hydrogen bomb above
Johnston Island in the South Pacific

1150
01:03:54,621 --> 01:03:57,490
The blast was quickly condemned
by the Soviet Union

1151
01:03:57,657 --> 01:04:01,261
who called upon all nations
to denounce the United States

1152
01:04:01,327 --> 01:04:02,695
for bringing the world
to the brink of destruction

1153
01:04:02,762 --> 01:04:04,230
Who the hell authorized the test?

1154
01:04:04,297 --> 01:04:05,598
What is this gonna say
to the Russians?

1155
01:04:05,732 --> 01:04:07,400
They look warlike?

1156
01:04:07,467 --> 01:04:09,302
Jesus Christ
we're lighting off nuclear weapons

1157
01:04:09,402 --> 01:04:11,104
like it's our own
private Fourth of July

1158
01:04:11,204 --> 01:04:12,038
You know what?

1159
01:04:12,172 --> 01:04:15,642
We should have brought in the guys
from the Atomic Energy Commission

1160
01:04:15,775 --> 01:04:17,477
and talked this through

1161
01:04:17,577 --> 01:04:20,113
Looked at these tests a little harder

1162
01:04:20,213 --> 01:04:22,282
before just giving the go-ahead

1163
01:04:24,584 --> 01:04:28,154
You know, last summer I read a book
"The Guns of August"

1164
01:04:28,788 --> 01:04:31,624
I wish every man on that blockade line
had read that book

1165
01:04:31,691 --> 01:04:32,759
It's World War One

1166
01:04:32,892 --> 01:04:34,694
There's thirteen million killed

1167
01:04:34,794 --> 01:04:36,129
It's all because the militaries
of both alliances believed

1168
01:04:36,262 --> 01:04:39,032
that they were so highly
attuned to one another's movements

1169
01:04:39,099 --> 01:04:41,935
and dispositions, they could
predict one another's intentions

1170
01:04:42,001 --> 01:04:44,370
But all their theories
were based on the last war

1171
01:04:44,471 --> 01:04:46,239
And the world
and technology had changed

1172
01:04:46,306 --> 01:04:48,641
and those lessons
were no longer valid

1173
01:04:48,708 --> 01:04:50,009
But it was all they knew

1174
01:04:50,143 --> 01:04:52,178
so the orders went out

1175
01:04:52,278 --> 01:04:54,180
couldn't be rescinded

1176
01:04:56,916 --> 01:04:58,985
The man in the field, his family
at home, they couldn't even tell

1177
01:04:59,052 --> 01:05:01,254
the reasons
why their lives were being destroyed

1178
01:05:04,657 --> 01:05:06,726
But why couldn't they stop it?

1179
01:05:07,494 --> 01:05:08,828
What could they have done?

1180
01:05:09,729 --> 01:05:11,731
Here we are 50 years later

1181
01:05:12,766 --> 01:05:15,969
Say one of their ships
resists the inspection

1182
01:05:16,102 --> 01:05:17,871
and we shoot out its rudder

1183
01:05:18,004 --> 01:05:19,572
and board

1184
01:05:19,672 --> 01:05:23,309
They shoot down
one of our planes in response

1185
01:05:23,443 --> 01:05:27,514
So we bomb their anti-aircraft sites
in response to that

1186
01:05:27,580 --> 01:05:29,416
They attack Berlin

1187
01:05:31,484 --> 01:05:33,253
So we invade Cuba

1188
01:05:36,156 --> 01:05:38,191
And they fire their missiles

1189
01:05:49,269 --> 01:05:52,505
Helen, I want you
to keep the kids close tomorrow

1190
01:05:53,173 --> 01:05:55,442
I want you to leave the TV on

1191
01:05:55,575 --> 01:05:58,311
I want you to sleep with it on
in the bedroom

1192
01:05:58,478 --> 01:06:00,880
until I call you
and tell you can turn it off

1193
01:06:01,014 --> 01:06:03,083
What's happened?

1194
01:06:03,183 --> 01:06:04,617
Nothing

1195
01:06:04,751 --> 01:06:07,420
you don't already know about

1196
01:06:07,520 --> 01:06:10,056
Just have the car ready to go
in case I call

1197
01:06:10,123 --> 01:06:12,625
or a Civil Defense Warning comes on

1198
01:06:13,293 --> 01:06:15,061
What happens to you?

1199
01:06:16,029 --> 01:06:18,131
I'm not leaving without you

1200
01:06:19,466 --> 01:06:22,469
I'll be evacuated with the President

1201
01:06:25,138 --> 01:06:26,539
Great

1202
01:06:29,576 --> 01:06:32,879
And while you're under a rock
somewhere with the President

1203
01:06:32,979 --> 01:06:34,414
what am I supposed to do
with our five children, Kenny?

1204
01:06:34,514 --> 01:06:35,515
Honey

1205
01:06:35,648 --> 01:06:38,551
We're not gonna let it come to that

1206
01:06:38,852 --> 01:06:40,320
I promise

1207
01:06:40,987 --> 01:06:43,590
Jack and Bobby

1208
01:06:43,990 --> 01:06:45,759
they're smart guys

1209
01:06:48,762 --> 01:06:50,497
You're smart, too

1210
01:06:54,567 --> 01:06:56,469
Not like them

1211
01:07:02,609 --> 01:07:03,977
Hi, Ken

1212
01:07:09,649 --> 01:07:13,586
Helen just asked me what arrangements
we have for the families

1213
01:07:13,653 --> 01:07:15,989
I just checked that myself

1214
01:07:16,022 --> 01:07:18,291
They're being issued identity cards

1215
01:07:18,425 --> 01:07:19,526
And if the call comes

1216
01:07:19,659 --> 01:07:23,363
evacuation officers meet them
at pre-arranged departure areas

1217
01:07:23,463 --> 01:07:25,231
They go by helicopter to Mount Weather

1218
01:07:25,331 --> 01:07:27,000
We meet them there

1219
01:07:31,104 --> 01:07:33,773
Course that's for morale

1220
01:07:33,940 --> 01:07:36,176
Missiles only take five minutes
to get here

1221
01:07:40,146 --> 01:07:42,449
The President
has asked Jackie and the children

1222
01:07:42,549 --> 01:07:45,552
to come back from the country
to be with him

1223
01:07:47,187 --> 01:07:49,322
You know those pictures upstairs...

1224
01:07:49,923 --> 01:07:51,458
of Lincoln?

1225
01:07:52,959 --> 01:07:55,361
He looked so old near the end

1226
01:07:56,963 --> 01:07:58,398
When we got here, I said

1227
01:07:58,531 --> 01:08:01,401
it's not gonna happen to us

1228
01:08:01,468 --> 01:08:03,636
We were too young

1229
01:08:04,704 --> 01:08:06,906
Why don't you go home tonight?

1230
01:08:07,941 --> 01:08:09,209
Go on home

1231
01:08:10,410 --> 01:08:11,711
Nah

1232
01:08:11,778 --> 01:08:13,913
It's too much trouble to get a car

1233
01:08:14,013 --> 01:08:16,950
Ken, we can get you a car
in 15 minutes

1234
01:08:17,050 --> 01:08:17,450
No

1235
01:08:17,584 --> 01:08:19,119
Go ahead

1236
01:08:19,185 --> 01:08:20,587
No

1237
01:08:20,920 --> 01:08:22,655
I'll let her sleep

1238
01:08:24,758 --> 01:08:26,659
I'll let 'em sleep

1239
01:08:27,160 --> 01:08:30,196
It almost seemed today as
if time stood still

1240
01:08:30,263 --> 01:08:32,165
The shooting hadn't started yet

1241
01:08:32,298 --> 01:08:34,067
but there weren't any
really encouraging signs

1242
01:08:34,167 --> 01:08:36,302
that it could be avoided

1243
01:08:36,369 --> 01:08:39,506
But worried, alarmed
afraid perhaps even...

1244
01:08:39,606 --> 01:08:42,108
the American public nonetheless

1245
01:08:42,175 --> 01:08:43,877
appeared determined and resolved

1246
01:08:45,712 --> 01:08:46,780
This is Walter Cronkite

1247
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:47,514
Good night

1248
01:10:30,016 --> 01:10:30,884
Gentlemen

1249
01:10:31,017 --> 01:10:32,252
can you hear me?

1250
01:10:32,318 --> 01:10:34,187
Yes, we hear you fine

1251
01:10:34,354 --> 01:10:36,589
I've got one minute 'til ten here

1252
01:10:36,723 --> 01:10:40,126
The quarantine commences in one minute

1253
01:10:45,331 --> 01:10:47,400
And no sign of them stopping

1254
01:11:02,515 --> 01:11:04,050
Sir

1255
01:11:11,491 --> 01:11:13,726
The quarantine is now in effect

1256
01:11:14,260 --> 01:11:18,098
And it looks like our first customers
are the Gagarin and Kimovsk

1257
01:11:36,916 --> 01:11:39,819
Chief, I've got something
at zero three zero

1258
01:11:40,653 --> 01:11:43,189
XO, take a look at this

1259
01:11:46,192 --> 01:11:47,794
New contact, Skipper

1260
01:11:54,801 --> 01:11:56,102
What do we got?

1261
01:11:56,202 --> 01:11:58,104
A Russian sub

1262
01:12:00,173 --> 01:12:09,082
General Quarters!
All hands, man your battle stations

1263
01:12:13,453 --> 01:12:17,390
Breaker 231, correlates
to our Submarine at 9, 000 yards

1264
01:12:21,828 --> 01:12:23,930
It's protecting the freighters

1265
01:12:32,539 --> 01:12:36,076
Bob, is there any way to
avoid stopping the submarine first?

1266
01:12:36,176 --> 01:12:37,977
I'm afraid not, Mr. President

1267
01:12:38,111 --> 01:12:41,114
The sub has positioned itself between
the Pierce and the Soviet ships

1268
01:12:41,181 --> 01:12:42,982
Admiral Anderson insists
it's too much of a risk

1269
01:12:43,083 --> 01:12:44,517
to proceed with
stopping the freighters

1270
01:12:44,651 --> 01:12:47,053
The Pierce would be
a sitting duck for the sub

1271
01:12:48,488 --> 01:12:49,656
Put me through to the Pierce

1272
01:12:49,789 --> 01:12:50,590
Yes, sir

1273
01:12:50,657 --> 01:12:51,891
Admiral Anderson

1274
01:12:51,991 --> 01:12:55,295
the President wishes to speak
directly to the Captain of the Pierce

1275
01:12:55,762 --> 01:12:57,130
Is that a problem?

1276
01:12:57,230 --> 01:12:58,965
No, it isn't, sir

1277
01:12:59,766 --> 01:13:01,668
He's putting you through, sir

1278
01:13:01,801 --> 01:13:03,536
Sir, I'm patching you
through to the bridge now

1279
01:13:05,638 --> 01:13:07,107
This is the Captain of the Pierce

1280
01:13:07,173 --> 01:13:09,209
Captain
this is the President speaking

1281
01:13:09,309 --> 01:13:10,376
Mr. President

1282
01:13:10,477 --> 01:13:13,079
Is there any way you can
force that sub to the surface

1283
01:13:13,179 --> 01:13:15,315
without damaging it or yourself?

1284
01:13:15,448 --> 01:13:16,983
I can bring it up, Mr. President

1285
01:13:17,050 --> 01:13:19,853
But whether it's damaged or not
is up to the sub

1286
01:13:19,953 --> 01:13:21,755
Even if they do force it up

1287
01:13:21,855 --> 01:13:24,324
that sub'll be inspected
over the crew's dead bodies

1288
01:13:24,390 --> 01:13:27,427
They'd be executed for allowing it
when they got home

1289
01:13:39,272 --> 01:13:40,740
Captain, force the sub to the surface

1290
01:13:40,874 --> 01:13:42,409
Yes, Mr. President

1291
01:13:43,877 --> 01:13:44,978
Prepare to fire torpedoes

1292
01:13:45,078 --> 01:13:46,446
Prepare to fire torpedoes. Aye, sir

1293
01:13:46,546 --> 01:13:47,414
Prepare to launch ASROC

1294
01:13:47,447 --> 01:13:48,915
Prepare to launch ASROC! Aye, sir

1295
01:14:17,744 --> 01:14:19,446
What're they up to?

1296
01:14:21,281 --> 01:14:22,649
Slowing down

1297
01:14:30,790 --> 01:14:32,992
They stopped

1298
01:14:33,126 --> 01:14:33,793
Mr. Secretary!

1299
01:14:33,927 --> 01:14:36,563
We're receiving reports
the Russian ships are stopping

1300
01:14:36,696 --> 01:14:37,497
Mr. President

1301
01:14:37,564 --> 01:14:39,432
Reports are coming in here
to the Pentagon that

1302
01:14:39,566 --> 01:14:41,401
the ships appear to b stopping

1303
01:14:41,568 --> 01:14:43,403
Captain, belay that order!

1304
01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:44,404
Hold you fire!

1305
01:14:44,504 --> 01:14:45,305
Where's that coming from?

1306
01:14:45,371 --> 01:14:46,573
One second, Mr. President

1307
01:14:46,639 --> 01:14:49,175
Somebody find out what's going on

1308
01:14:52,078 --> 01:14:54,114
Those ships are definitely stopping

1309
01:14:56,182 --> 01:14:57,951
Some are turning around

1310
01:15:00,186 --> 01:15:01,087
Are they stopping?

1311
01:15:01,221 --> 01:15:02,122
I don't know what they're doing

1312
01:15:02,255 --> 01:15:03,556
Admiral

1313
01:15:03,723 --> 01:15:04,958
Admiral, what's happening?

1314
01:15:05,024 --> 01:15:06,993
Yes, sir. They are... stopping

1315
01:15:08,495 --> 01:15:09,796
Mr. President

1316
01:15:09,863 --> 01:15:11,698
reports are coming in from all around

1317
01:15:11,831 --> 01:15:14,567
The ships are stopping

1318
01:15:14,667 --> 01:15:16,503
Some are turning around

1319
01:15:16,603 --> 01:15:19,139
Soem are turning around

1320
01:15:28,248 --> 01:15:31,918
We were eyeball to eyeball, and I
think the other fellow just blinked

1321
01:15:47,767 --> 01:15:49,235
Sir

1322
01:15:49,335 --> 01:15:51,538
Mr. President

1323
01:15:51,604 --> 01:15:53,139
Sir?

1324
01:15:53,273 --> 01:15:55,375
We have the tally from NSA

1325
01:15:55,442 --> 01:15:57,977
We have 20 ships
stopping and/or turning around

1326
01:15:58,111 --> 01:16:01,114
Six, however
appear to be continuing for the line

1327
01:16:04,250 --> 01:16:06,953
It's a mistake

1328
01:16:06,986 --> 01:16:09,923
They must not have gotten
their orders yet. Let 'em go

1329
01:16:09,989 --> 01:16:11,791
That's unlikely, Bobby

1330
01:16:11,891 --> 01:16:13,359
We've been monitoring
the radio transmissions

1331
01:16:13,460 --> 01:16:15,295
from the Gagarin and the Kimovsk

1332
01:16:15,361 --> 01:16:17,831
Their radios are working
just fine, Mr. President

1333
01:16:17,997 --> 01:16:21,000
One ship, an accident, maybe

1334
01:16:21,167 --> 01:16:23,303
Six, Mr. President, is intentional

1335
01:16:23,403 --> 01:16:24,771
Mr. President, let them go

1336
01:16:24,838 --> 01:16:25,939
You're still here?

1337
01:16:26,039 --> 01:16:29,609
4 of the 6 continuing ships
are still a day away from the line

1338
01:16:29,709 --> 01:16:32,512
They stopped the ones
we suspect have weapons aboard

1339
01:16:32,679 --> 01:16:35,281
We'd look pretty bad shooting up
a freighter full of baby food

1340
01:16:35,415 --> 01:16:37,250
We sure as shit would

1341
01:16:38,752 --> 01:16:41,254
Captain, I want you
to maintain contact with those ships

1342
01:16:41,321 --> 01:16:44,424
and do nothing until I order otherwise
Is that clear?

1343
01:16:44,491 --> 01:16:45,925
Yes, Mr. President

1344
01:16:45,992 --> 01:16:47,694
Contact only

1345
01:16:54,100 --> 01:16:55,034
At its beginning

1346
01:16:55,135 --> 01:16:57,637
this day looked as though
it might be one of...

1347
01:16:57,737 --> 01:16:59,305
armed conflict between
Soviet vessels and American war ships

1348
01:16:59,372 --> 01:17:03,943
on the sea lanes leading to Cuba

1349
01:17:04,043 --> 01:17:06,146
Find out how close
our exercises are coming...

1350
01:17:06,279 --> 01:17:08,815
to their anti-ship missiles

1351
01:17:32,539 --> 01:17:33,773
Goddammit

1352
01:17:33,840 --> 01:17:35,241
How the goddamn hell
could this happen?

1353
01:17:35,375 --> 01:17:37,343
I will have Power's head on a platter

1354
01:17:37,477 --> 01:17:39,612
Next to LeMay's

1355
01:17:39,712 --> 01:17:42,315
Kenny, you hear me
give the order to got o DEFCON 2?

1356
01:17:42,816 --> 01:17:45,318
'Cause I remember
giving the order to go to DEFCON 3

1357
01:17:45,452 --> 01:17:47,454
but I must be suffering from amnesia

1358
01:17:47,921 --> 01:17:50,990
I've just been informed
our nuclear forces are at DEFCON 2

1359
01:17:51,391 --> 01:17:52,225
Mr. President

1360
01:17:52,358 --> 01:17:53,426
the orders were limited...

1361
01:17:53,493 --> 01:17:57,464
to our strategic forces
in the continental United States

1362
01:17:57,530 --> 01:17:59,165
General LeMay is correct

1363
01:17:59,232 --> 01:18:01,234
Technically
SAC has the statutory authority...

1364
01:18:01,301 --> 01:18:03,103
I have the authority!

1365
01:18:03,636 --> 01:18:05,605
I am the commander-in-chief
of the United States

1366
01:18:05,672 --> 01:18:07,774
and I say when we go to war

1367
01:18:09,609 --> 01:18:12,846
We're not at war, sir
Not until DEFCON 1

1368
01:18:17,083 --> 01:18:18,585
General

1369
01:18:19,085 --> 01:18:23,223
the Joint Chiefs have just signaled
our intent to escalate to the Soviets

1370
01:18:23,289 --> 01:18:24,290
You've signaled an escalation

1371
01:18:24,424 --> 01:18:28,027
which I had no wish to signal
and which I did not approve

1372
01:18:29,963 --> 01:18:30,997
Get out of here, Max

1373
01:18:31,064 --> 01:18:32,665
Yes, sir

1374
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:42,709
Rescind the order. Can all the Chiefs

1375
01:18:42,809 --> 01:18:44,644
Put Nitze, Gilpatric
and the Undersecretaries in charge

1376
01:18:44,711 --> 01:18:45,445
Yes, we can

1377
01:18:45,512 --> 01:18:47,947
We can't fire the Chiefs, Bobby

1378
01:18:48,081 --> 01:18:50,150
Our invasion talk
would look like a bluff

1379
01:18:50,817 --> 01:18:53,920
Or even worse
if there's been an attempted coup

1380
01:18:57,123 --> 01:18:58,792
Jesus

1381
01:19:05,331 --> 01:19:06,966
Kenny

1382
01:19:07,067 --> 01:19:09,803
give me a couple minutes
alone with Bobby

1383
01:19:19,479 --> 01:19:22,515
Just try this on for size

1384
01:19:22,649 --> 01:19:24,818
We get a hold of Walter Lippman

1385
01:19:24,918 --> 01:19:28,955
and we leak the idea of pulling
our Jupiter missiles out of Turkey

1386
01:19:29,022 --> 01:19:31,624
The Soviets
pull their missiles out of Cuba

1387
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:35,161
We back JFK! K. and K. must talk!

1388
01:19:35,228 --> 01:19:36,696
End the arms race, not the human race

1389
01:19:36,763 --> 01:19:40,633
Hey, hey, JFK!
Let's not start a war today!

1390
01:19:48,007 --> 01:19:49,476
Kenny

1391
01:19:49,509 --> 01:19:50,276
Mac

1392
01:19:50,343 --> 01:19:51,811
What did you think of
the Lippman column this morning?

1393
01:19:51,945 --> 01:19:52,912
It's a bad idea

1394
01:19:53,046 --> 01:19:54,714
Thank God. Look
everybody's furious about it

1395
01:19:54,781 --> 01:19:57,283
We trade away our missiles in Turkey
and we are dead politically

1396
01:19:57,450 --> 01:19:58,551
You've gotta stop it

1397
01:19:58,685 --> 01:19:59,719
We know it was Jack and Bobby's idea

1398
01:19:59,819 --> 01:20:01,020
They leaked it to Lippman

1399
01:20:01,121 --> 01:20:02,455
The military guys are going ape
and they're not alone

1400
01:20:02,555 --> 01:20:04,591
They should speak up

1401
01:20:04,657 --> 01:20:05,658
Christ, Ken, it's not that easy

1402
01:20:05,792 --> 01:20:06,259
It is

1403
01:20:06,426 --> 01:20:07,961
It isn't. They don't trust
the people that feel this way

1404
01:20:08,061 --> 01:20:10,196
But these people are right
and the Kennedys are wrong

1405
01:20:10,263 --> 01:20:12,432
We need you to talk to them
They'll listen to you

1406
01:20:12,532 --> 01:20:13,900
Jack and Bobby are good men
But it takes a certain kind of...

1407
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,769
You mean the President
of the United States?

1408
01:20:15,869 --> 01:20:17,604
And the Attorney General?

1409
01:20:17,737 --> 01:20:18,905
Kenny, they are good men
but it takes certain character

1410
01:20:19,005 --> 01:20:21,241
moral toughness
to stand up to the Soviets

1411
01:20:22,509 --> 01:20:25,378
You're in the White House right now
because of the Kennedys

1412
01:20:25,445 --> 01:20:28,114
They may be wrong. They make mistakes

1413
01:20:28,248 --> 01:20:30,283
But they are not weak

1414
01:20:30,383 --> 01:20:32,719
The weak ones are these people
who can't speak their own minds

1415
01:20:32,786 --> 01:20:33,920
You know I don't mean
that they're weak

1416
01:20:34,020 --> 01:20:36,089
No, you just lack a "moral toughness"

1417
01:20:36,222 --> 01:20:39,392
Jesus Christ, Mac!

1418
01:20:39,459 --> 01:20:43,029
You think I'll play your Judas for you

1419
01:20:43,463 --> 01:20:44,931
You never understood us, for you

1420
01:20:45,031 --> 01:20:46,966
We've been fighting with each other
our whole lives

1421
01:20:47,100 --> 01:20:48,735
But nobody plays us off each other

1422
01:20:48,868 --> 01:20:50,336
and nobody ever

1423
01:20:50,503 --> 01:20:51,971
ever gets between us

1424
01:20:53,139 --> 01:20:54,808
It's trial balloon, Kenny

1425
01:20:54,941 --> 01:20:57,544
Then somebody better publicly deny it

1426
01:20:57,644 --> 01:21:00,146
because there's only one way
the world is gonna read this

1427
01:21:00,246 --> 01:21:04,217
We sell out one of our own friends
for own safety

1428
01:21:04,317 --> 01:21:05,919
Fuck!

1429
01:21:06,052 --> 01:21:07,587
Exactly

1430
01:21:08,822 --> 01:21:11,524
Jesus Christ. They're killing us

1431
01:21:11,591 --> 01:21:15,228
... and enter into negotiations...

1432
01:21:15,328 --> 01:21:17,464
in order to normalize
this confrontation

1433
01:21:17,564 --> 01:21:19,866
and avert the threat of a world war

1434
01:21:19,966 --> 01:21:22,602
What is that Sun Tzu says?

1435
01:21:23,870 --> 01:21:25,105
"War is a moral contest

1436
01:21:25,205 --> 01:21:27,674
and they're won in the temples
before they're ever fought. "

1437
01:21:27,807 --> 01:21:31,111
This enormous danger for all mankind...

1438
01:21:31,211 --> 01:21:34,147
which exists at this moment...

1439
01:21:34,247 --> 01:21:35,515
It's right here

1440
01:21:35,648 --> 01:21:37,016
This is where we turn it around

1441
01:21:37,083 --> 01:21:40,653
You all Adlai. You tell him
to stick it to this son of a bitch!

1442
01:21:44,190 --> 01:21:47,560
The U. S. believes that
with their economic boycott

1443
01:21:47,660 --> 01:21:51,898
by pressuring other countries
to cease trade with Cuba

1444
01:21:52,031 --> 01:21:54,701
we would surrender due to hunger

1445
01:21:54,768 --> 01:21:57,637
How does it feel, Mr. President,

1446
01:21:57,704 --> 01:21:59,873
to be this heroic...

1447
01:21:59,973 --> 01:22:02,442
and force a country
to surrender due to...

1448
01:22:02,509 --> 01:22:03,576
Am I still on hold?

1449
01:22:03,710 --> 01:22:05,678
They're trying to find him right now

1450
01:22:06,713 --> 01:22:07,881
Adlai's too weak!

1451
01:22:07,947 --> 01:22:10,316
We have to convince Jack to pull him
Get McCloy in there

1452
01:22:10,417 --> 01:22:11,885
You can't talk him out this
late in the game, bobby

1453
01:22:11,951 --> 01:22:14,254
Zorin will eat him alive

1454
01:22:14,287 --> 01:22:16,423
Then talk to your brother, goddammit!

1455
01:22:16,556 --> 01:22:19,225
The two of you don't need my advice
to get into trouble

1456
01:22:19,292 --> 01:22:21,127
What's gotten into you?

1457
01:22:24,964 --> 01:22:26,699
Are you still sore
about this Lippman thing?

1458
01:22:26,833 --> 01:22:29,803
That's something
your father would have done

1459
01:22:34,174 --> 01:22:35,675
My father?

1460
01:22:36,476 --> 01:22:38,144
I'm just trying to make a pint

1461
01:22:38,244 --> 01:22:41,281
This idea is that fucking bad

1462
01:22:43,450 --> 01:22:46,453
Adlai can handle Zorin
He knows the inning and the score

1463
01:22:46,553 --> 01:22:48,054
He's better

1464
01:22:48,188 --> 01:22:50,957
Because nobody believes
he's up to this

1465
01:22:51,091 --> 01:22:52,692
Nobody

1466
01:22:54,461 --> 01:22:55,128
Yes?

1467
01:22:55,228 --> 01:22:55,729
Adlai

1468
01:22:55,829 --> 01:22:56,262
Yes

1469
01:22:56,362 --> 01:22:57,964
It's Ken. How are you doing?

1470
01:22:58,064 --> 01:22:59,199
I'm busy, Ken

1471
01:22:59,265 --> 01:23:00,266
What do you need?

1472
01:23:00,400 --> 01:23:02,736
The President told me
to pass the word to you

1473
01:23:02,802 --> 01:23:04,738
stick it to them

1474
01:23:05,905 --> 01:23:07,140
I hear you

1475
01:23:07,273 --> 01:23:09,509
I'm glad it's you calling

1476
01:23:09,609 --> 01:23:11,144
I thought it would be Bobby

1477
01:23:11,277 --> 01:23:13,813
Adlai, the world has to know
we're right

1478
01:23:15,181 --> 01:23:16,082
If we're gonna have a chance
at a political solution

1479
01:23:16,149 --> 01:23:18,718
we're gonna need
international pressure

1480
01:23:19,452 --> 01:23:21,955
You gotta be tough, Adlai

1481
01:23:22,055 --> 01:23:24,691
You need to find it, Buddy

1482
01:23:25,191 --> 01:23:27,527
If they're still sticking
to their stonewalling strategy

1483
01:23:27,627 --> 01:23:29,596
I'll get them

1484
01:23:29,662 --> 01:23:32,265
I'm an old political cat, Kenny

1485
01:23:32,365 --> 01:23:34,334
But I've got onw life left

1486
01:23:34,434 --> 01:23:35,835
I know you do

1487
01:23:35,902 --> 01:23:37,404
See you, Ken

1488
01:23:41,141 --> 01:23:42,242
Boddy

1489
01:23:55,088 --> 01:23:56,723
we call upon the world

1490
01:23:56,856 --> 01:23:59,793
to condemn this purely
American provocation

1491
01:24:01,061 --> 01:24:04,064
We, the people of Romania

1492
01:24:04,130 --> 01:24:08,835
stand in solidarity with
the people of the Republic of Cuba

1493
01:24:08,968 --> 01:24:14,107
and their revolution in the face of
the American threat to world peace

1494
01:24:14,207 --> 01:24:16,276
Thank you, Mr. Chairman

1495
01:24:20,413 --> 01:24:28,888
We're very glad that
you could join us, Mr. Stevenson

1496
01:24:29,689 --> 01:24:32,992
For the last two hours

1497
01:24:33,093 --> 01:24:36,896
the entire world here
is asking only questions

1498
01:24:38,431 --> 01:24:42,001
The United States
is pushing the entire world

1499
01:24:42,102 --> 01:24:44,904
to the brink of catastrophe

1500
01:24:46,940 --> 01:24:51,478
People of the whole world
want to know why

1501
01:24:53,346 --> 01:24:56,349
We are told again and again about some

1502
01:24:56,416 --> 01:25:02,489
incontrovertible evidence
of offensive weapons in Cuba

1503
01:25:03,757 --> 01:25:09,295
But no evidence can be shown to us

1504
01:25:12,665 --> 01:25:16,770
Perhaps your spy planes are so secret

1505
01:25:16,903 --> 01:25:21,141
that you are simply incapable
to present such evidence

1506
01:25:21,241 --> 01:25:22,642
Some Planes!

1507
01:25:22,776 --> 01:25:24,110
I make the call, Adlai is out

1508
01:25:24,177 --> 01:25:25,478
McCloy goes in

1509
01:25:25,578 --> 01:25:28,982
simply don't have such evidence

1510
01:25:35,088 --> 01:25:40,360
Perhaps the United States of American
is simply mistaken

1511
01:25:44,197 --> 01:25:47,434
The United States of America
does not have any facts

1512
01:25:47,534 --> 01:25:49,836
it has only falsifications
False evidence...

1513
01:25:51,738 --> 01:25:56,643
John, get ready to
send your staffer in. He's coming out

1514
01:25:56,709 --> 01:25:58,511
The Chair recognizes

1515
01:25:58,645 --> 01:26:01,481
The representative
from the United States of America

1516
01:26:03,149 --> 01:26:07,087
Well, let me say something to you
Mr. Ambassador

1517
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:08,988
We do have the evidence

1518
01:26:09,055 --> 01:26:12,726
We do have it, and it is clear
and incontrovertible

1519
01:26:12,826 --> 01:26:14,961
And let me say something else

1520
01:26:15,061 --> 01:26:18,064
Those weapons
must be taken out of Cuba

1521
01:26:18,198 --> 01:26:21,101
You, the Soviet Union
have created this new danger

1522
01:26:21,167 --> 01:26:23,570
not the United States

1523
01:26:24,170 --> 01:26:26,339
Mr. Zorin, I remind you that

1524
01:26:26,439 --> 01:26:28,942
the other day you did not deny
the existence of these weapons

1525
01:26:29,008 --> 01:26:29,743
but today again

1526
01:26:29,809 --> 01:26:32,879
if I heard you correctly

1527
01:26:32,979 --> 01:26:35,582
you now say they do not exist

1528
01:26:41,588 --> 01:26:44,924
Sir, let me ask you
one simple question

1529
01:26:45,024 --> 01:26:46,793
Come on, Adlai. Don't let him off

1530
01:26:46,926 --> 01:26:51,831
Do you, Ambassador Zorin
deny that the USSR

1531
01:26:51,965 --> 01:26:52,365
has placed and is placing medium

1532
01:26:52,432 --> 01:26:55,769
and intermediate range missiles
and sites in Cuba?

1533
01:26:55,902 --> 01:26:56,803
Yes or no?

1534
01:26:56,870 --> 01:26:59,606
Don't wait for the translation
Yes or no?

1535
01:26:59,739 --> 01:27:02,742
Yeah

1536
01:27:05,478 --> 01:27:10,917
I am not in the American courtroom

1537
01:27:11,384 --> 01:27:16,790
and I do not wish to
respond to questions...

1538
01:27:16,923 --> 01:27:22,595
that a prosecutor
would put to the defendant

1539
01:27:22,662 --> 01:27:26,499
You will get all the answers
to your questions...

1540
01:27:26,599 --> 01:27:27,834
as this session progresses

1541
01:27:27,901 --> 01:27:30,437
You are in the courtroom
of world opinion right now

1542
01:27:30,570 --> 01:27:33,106
and you can answer yes or no

1543
01:27:33,173 --> 01:27:34,441
You have denied they exist

1544
01:27:34,607 --> 01:27:37,777
and I want to know
if I have understood you correctly

1545
01:27:38,611 --> 01:27:44,584
Continue your statement

1546
01:27:44,684 --> 01:27:47,253
You will get your answers
in due course. Don't worry

1547
01:27:51,024 --> 01:27:53,193
I'm prepared to wait for my answer
until Hell freezes over

1548
01:27:53,326 --> 01:27:56,763
if that's you decision

1549
01:28:00,133 --> 01:28:03,269
John, I'll get back to you

1550
01:28:04,104 --> 01:28:05,705
to present the evidence in this room

1551
01:28:05,805 --> 01:28:08,408
proving that the Soviet Union
has lied to the world

1552
01:28:09,442 --> 01:28:17,584
If you have decided
not to continue your statement

1553
01:28:17,717 --> 01:28:21,654
the Chair recognizes
the representative from Chile

1554
01:28:21,755 --> 01:28:26,059
I yield my time and the floor to the
representative of the United States

1555
01:28:26,993 --> 01:28:29,062
Ladies and gentlemen

1556
01:28:29,129 --> 01:28:32,098
since it appears
we're going to be here for a while

1557
01:28:32,232 --> 01:28:36,035
shall we have a look at
what the Soviets are doing in Cuba?

1558
01:28:36,136 --> 01:28:38,505
May we have the presentation, please?

1559
01:28:39,038 --> 01:28:42,575
Ladies and gentlemen
If you will observe in photograph A -

1560
01:28:43,243 --> 01:28:46,146
Yeah

1561
01:28:47,180 --> 01:28:48,648
So Adlai had it in him after all

1562
01:28:48,815 --> 01:28:50,984
Zorin must not
have gotten instructions

1563
01:28:51,084 --> 01:28:54,054
Somebody in their foreign
ministry's blown it big-time

1564
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,355
we have October 14th
a photograph taken then

1565
01:28:55,422 --> 01:29:00,627
There are at least
three missile sites being constructed

1566
01:29:00,760 --> 01:29:03,063
The ship is called the Grozny

1567
01:29:04,030 --> 01:29:06,466
We lost track of it
yesterday at nightfall

1568
01:29:07,100 --> 01:29:10,737
We thought we gave it plenty of room
when we moved the quarantine line back

1569
01:29:10,904 --> 01:29:12,939
We just reacquired it

1570
01:29:13,573 --> 01:29:14,707
It crossed the line hours ago

1571
01:29:14,841 --> 01:29:16,943
How the hell do you
lose a goddamn tanker?

1572
01:29:16,976 --> 01:29:18,478
What the hell's going on over there?

1573
01:29:20,180 --> 01:29:24,150
Friday, October 26th

1574
01:29:30,123 --> 01:29:32,092
Hail them again

1575
01:29:33,460 --> 01:29:35,662
I want you to try them again

1576
01:29:44,003 --> 01:29:45,305
We are kidding ourselves

1577
01:29:45,371 --> 01:29:47,307
The coordinates for the Pierce

1578
01:29:48,808 --> 01:29:51,010
Pierce coordinates, 25 degrees
30 minutes north

1579
01:29:51,111 --> 01:29:52,846
78 degrees, 10 minutes west

1580
01:30:12,365 --> 01:30:13,666
Not responding, Chief!

1581
01:30:13,700 --> 01:30:15,935
Tell the Skipper

1582
01:30:16,069 --> 01:30:17,604
They're not responding, sir

1583
01:30:17,737 --> 01:30:19,706
General quarters!

1584
01:30:19,773 --> 01:30:23,543
All hands man your battle stations!

1585
01:30:33,520 --> 01:30:35,455
Very well. Load your guns

1586
01:30:35,588 --> 01:30:37,757
Guns are loaded, sir

1587
01:30:37,891 --> 01:30:39,159
What was that, Admiral?

1588
01:30:39,225 --> 01:30:42,629
We've been hailing the Grozny
for the last hour, Mr. Secretary

1589
01:30:42,762 --> 01:30:44,464
The Grozny refuses to stop

1590
01:30:44,597 --> 01:30:46,366
What are you doing?

1591
01:30:46,433 --> 01:30:48,868
We're carrying out our mission
Mr. Secretary

1592
01:30:48,935 --> 01:30:51,371
We're very busy right now
We need to able to do our job

1593
01:30:51,504 --> 01:30:54,874
Admiral! I asked you a question

1594
01:30:54,974 --> 01:30:57,944
We're going to
follow the rules of engagement

1595
01:30:58,044 --> 01:31:01,848
The rules of engagement
which the President

1596
01:31:01,915 --> 01:31:03,616
has approved and signed
in his order of 23 October

1597
01:31:04,751 --> 01:31:06,519
Yes

1598
01:31:07,120 --> 01:31:09,022
You may proceed, Captain

1599
01:31:09,189 --> 01:31:10,490
Cler your guns

1600
01:31:13,860 --> 01:31:14,794
Dammit!

1601
01:31:14,928 --> 01:31:15,628
Stop that firing!

1602
01:31:15,762 --> 01:31:16,129
What?

1603
01:31:16,196 --> 01:31:18,298
Stop that firing!

1604
01:31:18,364 --> 01:31:20,266
Cease fire

1605
01:31:20,366 --> 01:31:21,835
God help us

1606
01:31:24,337 --> 01:31:26,239
That ship was firing starshells!

1607
01:31:26,372 --> 01:31:28,875
Starshells -- Flares, Mr. Secretary!

1608
01:31:28,942 --> 01:31:31,144
Goddammit, I've got a job to do here!

1609
01:31:31,244 --> 01:31:33,380
You've been camped out up there
since Monday night

1610
01:31:33,513 --> 01:31:36,649
You're exhausted
you're making mistakes

1611
01:31:36,750 --> 01:31:38,918
You interfere with me and
you will get some of my men killed

1612
01:31:38,985 --> 01:31:41,354
and I will not allow that!

1613
01:31:41,454 --> 01:31:43,056
Starshells

1614
01:31:43,156 --> 01:31:45,658
Get out of our way, Mr. Secretart!

1615
01:31:45,692 --> 01:31:47,394
The navy's been running blockades...

1616
01:31:47,494 --> 01:31:49,028
since the days of John Paul Jones!

1617
01:31:49,095 --> 01:31:50,597
I believe the President
made it clear that there will be...

1618
01:31:50,730 --> 01:31:53,666
no firing on ships
without his express permission

1619
01:31:53,800 --> 01:31:56,369
With all due respect, Mr. Secretary

1620
01:31:56,436 --> 01:31:58,371
we were not firing on that ship

1621
01:31:58,438 --> 01:31:59,472
What was that?

1622
01:31:59,572 --> 01:32:01,674
Firing on a ship
means attacking a ship!

1623
01:32:01,775 --> 01:32:03,910
We were not attacking that ship!

1624
01:32:04,010 --> 01:32:05,678
We were firing over it!

1625
01:32:05,779 --> 01:32:09,049
That was not the President's intention
when he gave that order

1626
01:32:09,149 --> 01:32:11,117
What if the Soviets
don't see the distinction?

1627
01:32:11,284 --> 01:32:14,654
What if they make the same mistake
I just made?

1628
01:32:14,788 --> 01:32:15,922
There will be no firing anything
near any Soviet ships

1629
01:32:16,022 --> 01:32:19,192
without my express permission!

1630
01:32:19,292 --> 01:32:22,162
Is that understood, Admiral?

1631
01:32:22,595 --> 01:32:24,497
Is it?

1632
01:32:25,799 --> 01:32:27,233
Yes, sir

1633
01:32:27,300 --> 01:32:29,069
And I will only
issue such instructions...

1634
01:32:29,202 --> 01:32:32,072
when ordered to by the President!

1635
01:32:33,673 --> 01:32:36,076
John Paul Jones!

1636
01:32:36,609 --> 01:32:38,978
You don't understand a thing
do you, Admiral?

1637
01:32:39,045 --> 01:32:41,047
This is not a blockade!

1638
01:32:41,147 --> 01:32:43,583
This is language!

1639
01:32:43,650 --> 01:32:46,720
A new vocabulary, the likes of
which the world has never seen!

1640
01:32:46,820 --> 01:32:51,458
This is President Kennedy
communicating with Secretary Krushcev

1641
01:32:59,065 --> 01:33:03,369
(Atlas Missile Launch Vandenberg, AFB)

1642
01:33:03,503 --> 01:33:05,472
Who the hell
authorized this missile test?

1643
01:33:05,572 --> 01:33:06,639
Who do you think?

1644
01:33:06,773 --> 01:33:08,908
God knows what this is
gonna communicate to the Soviets

1645
01:33:09,008 --> 01:33:11,077
Communicate with the Soviets?

1646
01:33:11,144 --> 01:33:12,746
We can't communitcate
with the Pentagon

1647
01:33:12,779 --> 01:33:15,081
and it's just across the goddam river

1648
01:33:15,148 --> 01:33:17,317
LaMay must think you're afraid of him

1649
01:33:17,417 --> 01:33:19,452
I'm not taking that biat

1650
01:33:19,552 --> 01:33:21,388
The right move here is to move on

1651
01:33:23,623 --> 01:33:24,924
Marcula!

1652
01:33:25,058 --> 01:33:31,664
This is United States Destroyer
Joseph P. Kennedy!

1653
01:33:33,266 --> 01:33:34,467
This is point
at which we are concemed...

1654
01:33:34,567 --> 01:33:38,571
that there might be shooting
among the ships at sea

1655
01:33:38,571 --> 01:33:41,875
with the possibility that invasion
might have to be undertaken

1656
01:33:41,875 --> 01:33:45,445
to assure that
those bases are eliminated

1657
01:33:45,612 --> 01:33:47,814
If invasion is undertaken
the Russians have said

1658
01:33:47,947 --> 01:33:51,484
that they would
retaliate with rocket fire

1659
01:33:51,618 --> 01:33:53,420
We have said
if there's rocket fire from Cuba

1660
01:33:53,486 --> 01:33:57,524
we will retaliate
And there goes the whole ballgame

1661
01:33:57,624 --> 01:33:58,992
Kenny

1662
01:33:59,092 --> 01:34:00,660
What's this?

1663
01:34:00,760 --> 01:34:02,328
Can anyone just walk in here now?

1664
01:34:02,429 --> 01:34:03,963
Ken, don't worry
I'm not here to do an interview

1665
01:34:04,097 --> 01:34:06,166
If you're looking for a cup of sugar
John, you got the wrong door

1666
01:34:06,232 --> 01:34:07,467
Kenny

1667
01:34:07,567 --> 01:34:09,169
we need to see the President

1668
01:34:09,269 --> 01:34:10,737
Something's happened

1669
01:34:12,939 --> 01:34:15,742
I have lunch with him
Maybe once a month

1670
01:34:15,842 --> 01:34:18,244
Way the talks, he acts like
he knows Kruschev personally

1671
01:34:18,344 --> 01:34:20,180
but he's never elaborated

1672
01:34:20,880 --> 01:34:23,249
I've used him as a source
in a couple of stories

1673
01:34:23,383 --> 01:34:28,021
The FBI has identified
this Alexander Fomin as the...

1674
01:34:28,088 --> 01:34:30,990
Soviet Rezident, the KGB equivalent
of one of our station chiefs

1675
01:34:31,057 --> 01:34:34,160
He's their highest ranking spy
in this country

1676
01:34:34,227 --> 01:34:35,428
And he knows John's a friend of mine

1677
01:34:35,562 --> 01:34:37,864
All the trademarks of
a back-channel overture

1678
01:34:37,931 --> 01:34:40,667
Yeah. Some back channel

1679
01:34:40,734 --> 01:34:44,037
ABC News guy
My goddamn next-door neighbor

1680
01:34:46,272 --> 01:34:48,208
So they'll remove the missiles

1681
01:34:48,274 --> 01:34:51,010
And we'll pledge not to
invade Cuba or de-stabilize Castro

1682
01:34:51,111 --> 01:34:53,380
or assist anyone who plans on doing so

1683
01:34:57,283 --> 01:35:00,520
I think this may be
our first real message from Kruschev

1684
01:35:00,587 --> 01:35:01,888
The alternative, Mr. President

1685
01:35:02,021 --> 01:35:04,858
is that is this could be a trap

1686
01:35:05,358 --> 01:35:06,760
And how is that exactly?

1687
01:35:06,860 --> 01:35:08,428
Dangle a settlement

1688
01:35:08,561 --> 01:35:11,264
tie us down in negotiations
we come up short

1689
01:35:11,931 --> 01:35:14,300
Why else would they
approach us this way?

1690
01:35:14,401 --> 01:35:15,835
It's deniable

1691
01:35:15,935 --> 01:35:16,870
The Soviets have done nothing
but lie to us

1692
01:35:16,936 --> 01:35:18,772
This could just be more of the same

1693
01:35:18,838 --> 01:35:21,641
That may be
why Kruschev's introducing this guy

1694
01:35:22,042 --> 01:35:24,778
We're been burned by his usual players
in the formal channels

1695
01:35:24,878 --> 01:35:27,414
so he brings in an honest broker

1696
01:35:27,480 --> 01:35:29,582
That may be what they want us to think

1697
01:35:29,949 --> 01:35:30,917
The truth is

1698
01:35:31,017 --> 01:35:33,820
we don't really know
who Fomin speaks for

1699
01:35:33,953 --> 01:35:35,055
It could be Kruschev

1700
01:35:35,155 --> 01:35:37,090
It could be some faction
in the Politburo

1701
01:35:37,223 --> 01:35:38,758
Or the KGB itself

1702
01:35:38,825 --> 01:35:40,026
We just don't know

1703
01:35:40,493 --> 01:35:43,863
By the way, Scali
your activities now fall under...

1704
01:35:43,963 --> 01:35:45,765
the secrecy codicils
of the National Security Act

1705
01:35:45,899 --> 01:35:47,300
Sorry, John

1706
01:35:47,367 --> 01:35:49,035
No Pulitzer

1707
01:35:50,370 --> 01:35:52,772
Mr. President, we haven't much time

1708
01:35:52,872 --> 01:35:55,575
I'm scheduled to meet with him again
in three and a half hours

1709
01:35:55,709 --> 01:35:57,777
So it seems the question of the day is

1710
01:35:57,844 --> 01:35:59,546
is the offer legitimate?

1711
01:36:00,380 --> 01:36:02,048
And if it is

1712
01:36:02,115 --> 01:36:04,818
we can't afford to ignore it

1713
01:36:05,685 --> 01:36:07,987
So, John...

1714
01:36:08,488 --> 01:36:11,991
We'll have instructions for you
in a couple of hours

1715
01:36:12,125 --> 01:36:13,460
Thank you

1716
01:36:15,295 --> 01:36:16,730
Thank you

1717
01:36:18,598 --> 01:36:22,435
We don't have much time
to play out back-channe

1718
01:36:26,639 --> 01:36:29,075
Kenny

1719
01:36:30,410 --> 01:36:32,479
I want you to get over
to your old stomping grounds...

1720
01:36:32,545 --> 01:36:35,281
and go through everything
the FBI has on Fomin

1721
01:36:35,382 --> 01:36:37,450
I need your best call
Is the guy legit

1722
01:36:37,517 --> 01:36:39,419
and is he speaking for Kruschev?

1723
01:36:39,886 --> 01:36:40,954
So what we've got here is this guy

1724
01:36:41,087 --> 01:36:44,157
Alexander Feklisov
AKA Alexander Fomin

1725
01:36:44,224 --> 01:36:46,926
delclared Consul to the Soviet Embassy

1726
01:36:47,093 --> 01:36:49,095
but in reality the KGB Papa Spy

1727
01:36:49,863 --> 01:36:52,432
An illustrious tour of duty
during the Great Patriotic War

1728
01:36:52,532 --> 01:36:54,801
gets him on the Party fast track

1729
01:36:54,901 --> 01:36:59,706
Various tours of duty in KGB
American postings

1730
01:36:59,773 --> 01:37:01,141
He's an expert on us

1731
01:37:01,207 --> 01:37:03,777
And that is all we got on Papa Spy

1732
01:37:06,913 --> 01:37:10,050
How do you become the KGB top spy
in the United States?

1733
01:37:10,116 --> 01:37:12,152
Gotta know someone

1734
01:37:12,552 --> 01:37:13,853
You gotta know someone

1735
01:37:15,722 --> 01:37:17,624
So politics is politics

1736
01:37:29,469 --> 01:37:32,272
Walter, get me Kruschev's files

1737
01:37:32,338 --> 01:37:32,939
Pass me that

1738
01:37:33,039 --> 01:37:37,243
I wanna see their career
chronologies side by side

1739
01:37:37,310 --> 01:37:39,045
We know they're not related, right?

1740
01:37:39,145 --> 01:37:39,746
Right

1741
01:37:39,846 --> 01:37:42,082
They're not from the same hometown

1742
01:37:42,148 --> 01:37:43,450
They went to different schools

1743
01:37:43,583 --> 01:37:45,452
Right

1744
01:37:45,552 --> 01:37:47,787
So if they were gonna meet

1745
01:37:47,854 --> 01:37:49,823
they should have met here

1746
01:37:49,956 --> 01:37:50,824
I think they could've met

1747
01:37:50,924 --> 01:37:52,492
They could not

1748
01:37:52,625 --> 01:37:54,661
He was an engineer
stationed outside of Moscow

1749
01:37:54,728 --> 01:37:56,629
at the end of '41

1750
01:37:57,864 --> 01:37:59,499
That's it

1751
01:38:00,033 --> 01:38:01,434
They know each other

1752
01:38:02,035 --> 01:38:02,902
They're war buddies

1753
01:38:03,036 --> 01:38:04,504
That's pretty thin, Kenny

1754
01:38:04,637 --> 01:38:06,840
Real life usually is, Walter

1755
01:38:08,808 --> 01:38:10,577
They know each other, Jack

1756
01:38:10,643 --> 01:38:12,545
Kruschev and Fomin were war buddies

1757
01:38:12,612 --> 01:38:13,513
You sure?

1758
01:38:13,613 --> 01:38:16,583
Don't take it to court, but we've
got good circumstantial evidenct

1759
01:38:16,716 --> 01:38:22,389
What's your instinct?
I gotta move on this

1760
01:38:22,455 --> 01:38:23,690
My gut's telling me that

1761
01:38:23,823 --> 01:38:28,695
Kruschev's tuming to a trusted
old friend to carry his message

1762
01:38:28,828 --> 01:38:30,930
Okay. We're going

1763
01:38:32,499 --> 01:38:33,767
I've been instructed to tell you

1764
01:38:33,900 --> 01:38:36,202
that the American government
would respond favorably

1765
01:38:36,302 --> 01:38:38,972
to an offer along the lines
that you have discussed

1766
01:38:39,372 --> 01:38:42,509
If such a solution were raised
at the U. N. by Ambassador Zorin

1767
01:38:42,542 --> 01:38:45,478
he would find a favorable reply
from Ambassador Stevenson

1768
01:38:46,146 --> 01:38:49,449
So I understand you correctly

1769
01:38:49,616 --> 01:38:52,986
if the missiles in Cuba
were dismantled

1770
01:38:53,086 --> 01:38:55,188
returned to the Soviet Union

1771
01:38:55,355 --> 01:38:57,724
and a guarantee was made
not to reintroduce them

1772
01:38:57,857 --> 01:38:59,692
the United States
would be prepared to guarantee

1773
01:38:59,759 --> 01:39:02,695
that it would never invade Cuba

1774
01:39:02,829 --> 01:39:04,631
That is correct

1775
01:39:04,731 --> 01:39:06,166
And this is from
the Highest Authority?

1776
01:39:06,232 --> 01:39:08,101
Yes. The Highest Authority

1777
01:39:09,402 --> 01:39:11,004
There are two conditions

1778
01:39:11,071 --> 01:39:14,708
The U. N. must be allowed to
inspect the removal of the missiles

1779
01:39:15,208 --> 01:39:17,777
Of course the U. N.
must also be allowed to observe

1780
01:39:17,911 --> 01:39:20,313
the re-deployment of forces
from the American Southeast

1781
01:39:20,447 --> 01:39:21,781
I can't speak to that

1782
01:39:23,416 --> 01:39:25,585
What's the second condition?

1783
01:39:25,618 --> 01:39:27,220
Time is of the essence

1784
01:39:27,320 --> 01:39:28,288
How much time?

1785
01:39:28,421 --> 01:39:29,756
48 hours

1786
01:39:29,889 --> 01:39:33,026
In 48 hours, there can be no deals

1787
01:39:36,229 --> 01:39:37,297
I'll see what I can do

1788
01:39:54,247 --> 01:39:56,816
I think it's very difficult
to make a decision from this document

1789
01:39:56,883 --> 01:39:59,185
It looks to me like
Fomin's overture was genuine

1790
01:39:59,319 --> 01:40:00,553
It's a big "if", Bobby

1791
01:40:00,720 --> 01:40:02,322
It's ten pages of sentimental fluff

1792
01:40:02,455 --> 01:40:03,957
but he's saying it right here

1793
01:40:03,990 --> 01:40:07,660
He'll remove the missiles
in return for a no-invasion pledge

1794
01:40:07,727 --> 01:40:10,830
Mr. President, our early analysis
says this probably...

1795
01:40:10,897 --> 01:40:12,465
was written by Kruschev himself
It's a first draft

1796
01:40:12,932 --> 01:40:14,401
It shows no signs of being polished
by the foreign ministry

1797
01:40:14,501 --> 01:40:16,469
It probably wasn't
even approved by the Politburo

1798
01:40:16,536 --> 01:40:21,374
as they wouldn't
let the emotionalism go by

1799
01:40:21,474 --> 01:40:25,578
The analysts say it was written
by someone under considerable stress

1800
01:40:26,346 --> 01:40:28,281
Glad to know we're not alone

1801
01:40:31,251 --> 01:40:34,521
It never was my intention
to invade Cuba anyway

1802
01:40:34,587 --> 01:40:37,057
till they put the missiles in there

1803
01:40:38,425 --> 01:40:42,662
Gentlemen, I think we should
seriously consider this deal

1804
01:41:15,128 --> 01:41:15,962
Hi

1805
01:41:16,062 --> 01:41:17,530
Hi

1806
01:41:17,997 --> 01:41:20,033
You look old, O'Donnell

1807
01:41:20,967 --> 01:41:22,869
You don't

1808
01:41:23,002 --> 01:41:28,908
It's 2:30 in the morning
You flirting with me?

1809
01:41:28,975 --> 01:41:31,845
We got a back-channel communication

1810
01:41:32,011 --> 01:41:36,182
form Kruschev this evening
feeling us out about a deal

1811
01:41:36,282 --> 01:41:38,385
He confirmed it
just a little while ago in a letter

1812
01:41:38,518 --> 01:41:40,387
Thank God

1813
01:41:40,487 --> 01:41:44,257
Jack kicked us out of his house
for the night

1814
01:41:44,691 --> 01:41:46,526
Darn it

1815
01:41:46,626 --> 01:41:49,095
For a second there
I thought you'd been fired

1816
01:41:49,229 --> 01:41:51,164
No such luck

1817
01:41:57,237 --> 01:41:59,572
Driving home

1818
01:42:00,840 --> 01:42:04,277
there was something
I wanted to tell you

1819
01:42:10,683 --> 01:42:12,719
Finish that thought

1820
01:42:16,389 --> 01:42:16,956
Yes?

1821
01:42:17,090 --> 01:42:17,957
Kenny, It's Bob

1822
01:42:18,024 --> 01:42:20,527
We're getting another letter
over the teletype from Kruschev

1823
01:42:20,627 --> 01:42:21,394
I have a bad feeling

1824
01:42:21,528 --> 01:42:22,996
I'll be right there

1825
01:42:29,903 --> 01:42:31,237
You're beautiful

1826
01:42:37,677 --> 01:42:39,746
It looks like
Fomin was a ploy after all

1827
01:42:39,813 --> 01:42:41,448
and they were just stalling for time

1828
01:42:48,621 --> 01:42:50,390
It gets worse

1829
01:42:51,124 --> 01:42:52,025
Gentlemen

1830
01:42:52,125 --> 01:42:54,194
my specialists are in agreement

1831
01:42:54,728 --> 01:42:56,463
This morning's letter is not Kruschev
Last night's letter was

1832
01:42:56,596 --> 01:42:58,064
The evidence supports
only one conclusion

1833
01:42:58,665 --> 01:43:03,770
There's been a coup
and Kruschev was replaced overnight

1834
01:43:04,304 --> 01:43:05,205
Dean?

1835
01:43:05,338 --> 01:43:08,775
It does suggest he's been co-opted
by hard-line elements

1836
01:43:08,908 --> 01:43:11,144
Which at the end of the day
amounts to the same thing

1837
01:43:11,277 --> 01:43:12,412
A puppet Kruschev

1838
01:43:12,545 --> 01:43:14,981
and a hard-line Soviet government
pulling the strings

1839
01:43:15,048 --> 01:43:18,451
No deal. And the missiles
are almost operational

1840
01:43:18,485 --> 01:43:21,154
What if the Soviets have no intention
of honoring this second deal?

1841
01:43:21,254 --> 01:43:23,189
The tomorrow
they make another condition

1842
01:43:23,289 --> 01:43:25,825
Meanwhile
the quarantine isn't working

1843
01:43:25,925 --> 01:43:28,395
and they're completing work
on the missiles sites

1844
01:43:29,162 --> 01:43:32,532
Sir, I think we have to issue
pre- invasion orders for our forces

1845
01:43:33,033 --> 01:43:34,601
Mr. President

1846
01:43:34,701 --> 01:43:36,469
This morning's photography is in

1847
01:43:37,037 --> 01:43:41,274
It appears the Soviet have commenced a
crash program to ready their missiles

1848
01:43:41,408 --> 01:43:44,210
The first missiles
become operational last night

1849
01:43:44,611 --> 01:43:47,147
We expect they'll all be operational
in 36 hours

1850
01:43:47,280 --> 01:43:48,581
Then we're out of time

1851
01:43:48,648 --> 01:43:49,382
We have to go in

1852
01:43:49,449 --> 01:43:51,351
That may not be
as easy as we thought, either

1853
01:43:51,518 --> 01:43:54,954
We have confirmation
the Soviets have also deployed

1854
01:43:55,088 --> 01:43:56,222
battlefield nuclear weapons to Cuba

1855
01:43:56,356 --> 01:43:57,490
FROGS, we call them

1856
01:43:57,590 --> 01:43:59,726
Short- range tactical nukes

1857
01:43:59,793 --> 01:44:02,462
We don't know whether
they've delegated release authority

1858
01:44:02,595 --> 01:44:05,665
to their local commanders
for use on our invasion troops

1859
01:44:05,799 --> 01:44:08,068
But the good news is
as of this moment

1860
01:44:08,134 --> 01:44:10,704
we know where the FROGS are
and we can target them, too

1861
01:44:11,938 --> 01:44:15,508
But the longer we wait
the harder it's going to get

1862
01:44:31,057 --> 01:44:32,792
We have no choice

1863
01:44:37,230 --> 01:44:39,232
General, issue orders to our forces

1864
01:44:39,366 --> 01:44:41,935
to be prepared to execute
the air strikes Monday morning

1865
01:44:43,136 --> 01:44:46,306
and the follow-on invasion
according to the schedule thereafter

1866
01:44:47,240 --> 01:44:50,143
I'll need the official release orders
on my desk Sunday night

1867
01:44:50,310 --> 01:44:51,745
Understood, sir

1868
01:44:52,212 --> 01:44:54,013
We need to step up our over flights

1869
01:44:54,114 --> 01:44:58,251
finalize our pilots' target folders
in order to carry out the strikes

1870
01:44:59,285 --> 01:45:00,286
Permission granted

1871
01:45:00,387 --> 01:45:01,488
Yes, sir

1872
01:45:11,865 --> 01:45:12,966
Gentlemen

1873
01:45:13,400 --> 01:45:16,336
if anybody's got any great ideas
now's the time

1874
01:45:24,711 --> 01:45:26,613
Major Anderson
there's a phone call for you

1875
01:45:26,713 --> 01:45:28,581
Thank you

1876
01:45:28,915 --> 01:45:30,583
Gimme just a second here, guys

1877
01:45:34,054 --> 01:45:35,555
This is Major Anderson

1878
01:45:37,290 --> 01:45:39,259
Hello? Anyone there?

1879
01:45:39,359 --> 01:45:39,859
Major?

1880
01:45:39,993 --> 01:45:41,194
Yes, sir

1881
01:45:41,294 --> 01:45:45,632
My name's Kenneth O'Donnell
Special Assistant to the President

1882
01:45:45,699 --> 01:45:48,201
Major, a few days ago
the President ordered me to...

1883
01:45:48,368 --> 01:45:51,104
help him keep control of
what's going on out there

1884
01:45:51,604 --> 01:45:56,676
I've been brow-beating pilots
navy guys left and right

1885
01:45:56,776 --> 01:46:00,380
to make sure you don't get us here
in Washington into trouble

1886
01:46:00,547 --> 01:46:02,949
But you know what?

1887
01:46:03,349 --> 01:46:06,653
We're pretty damn good ourselves
at getting into trouble

1888
01:46:06,720 --> 01:46:09,289
So instead of riding your ass

1889
01:46:09,756 --> 01:46:11,224
I'm just gonna tell you
what's going on here

1890
01:46:11,324 --> 01:46:13,159
and let you figure out
how best to help us out up here

1891
01:46:13,293 --> 01:46:14,894
Go ahead, sir

1892
01:46:15,528 --> 01:46:17,564
Last night, it looked like

1893
01:46:17,664 --> 01:46:20,367
we were gonna cut a deal
to get us all out of this mess

1894
01:46:20,834 --> 01:46:23,803
Today the Soviets are reneging

1895
01:46:23,870 --> 01:46:25,572
We're gonna try
and salvage the situation

1896
01:46:25,705 --> 01:46:30,009
but a lot of things
are going wrong today

1897
01:46:30,143 --> 01:46:32,679
It's making everyone nervous

1898
01:46:32,812 --> 01:46:35,515
If more things go wrong
people will become more nervous

1899
01:46:35,615 --> 01:46:39,119
and it will be very hard
to aviod going to war

1900
01:46:40,520 --> 01:46:42,789
I'm not sure
what you're trying to tell me, sir

1901
01:46:42,956 --> 01:46:44,224
Just my standard line

1902
01:46:44,357 --> 01:46:48,395
I've been repeating
to guys like you all week

1903
01:46:48,828 --> 01:46:50,630
Don't get shot down

1904
01:46:52,532 --> 01:46:53,466
Beyond that

1905
01:46:53,633 --> 01:46:56,236
whatever else you can do to help us
I'd appreciate it

1906
01:46:56,369 --> 01:46:58,271
Sir

1907
01:47:00,640 --> 01:47:05,779
When you're at 72, 000 feet
a million things can go wrong

1908
01:47:05,845 --> 01:47:09,616
Is your Oxygen mix right?
Are your cameras gonna freeze up?

1909
01:47:09,749 --> 01:47:10,717
Are you leaving a contrail?

1910
01:47:10,850 --> 01:47:13,753
Those million things
they're beyond your control, mostly

1911
01:47:13,820 --> 01:47:16,589
But...

1912
01:47:16,690 --> 01:47:19,159
when you realize that

1913
01:47:19,225 --> 01:47:21,061
there's a kind of peace

1914
01:47:21,127 --> 01:47:23,830
If you're a good man
and if your ground crew are good men

1915
01:47:23,897 --> 01:47:25,665
that is all you can ask for

1916
01:47:25,765 --> 01:47:28,668
And with the grace of God
that'll get you through

1917
01:47:29,135 --> 01:47:30,970
Are you a religious man?

1918
01:47:31,037 --> 01:47:32,472
I am

1919
01:47:34,808 --> 01:47:36,042
Good

1920
01:49:54,748 --> 01:49:56,549
The plane is missing, Kenny

1921
01:49:57,183 --> 01:49:59,552
We are presuming the pilot is dead

1922
01:50:12,032 --> 01:50:16,036
It's hard to believe with the Soviet
centralized command structure

1923
01:50:16,136 --> 01:50:17,971
that this could have been
an accidental launch

1924
01:50:18,104 --> 01:50:19,873
The question is, does this
attack on our plane represent

1925
01:50:20,040 --> 01:50:23,676
a definitive intentional escalation
on the part of the Soviets?

1926
01:50:23,810 --> 01:50:25,245
Mr. President

1927
01:50:25,311 --> 01:50:27,680
taken with the events
of the past few hours

1928
01:50:27,814 --> 01:50:30,083
I believe
this confirms our worst fears

1929
01:50:30,183 --> 01:50:32,585
We're now dealing with
a hard-line Soviet government

1930
01:50:32,652 --> 01:50:34,688
perhaps with Kruschev
as a puppet head, perhaps not

1931
01:50:34,821 --> 01:50:35,955
You okay?

1932
01:50:36,056 --> 01:50:37,557
Yeah

1933
01:50:38,191 --> 01:50:39,325
I'm fine

1934
01:50:41,261 --> 01:50:42,262
Mr. President

1935
01:50:42,896 --> 01:50:43,797
What now?

1936
01:50:43,930 --> 01:50:46,533
A U-2 on a routine
air- sampling mission got lost

1937
01:50:46,633 --> 01:50:48,401
and penetrated
Soviet airspace over Siberia

1938
01:50:48,468 --> 01:50:49,703
Oh, goddammit

1939
01:50:49,803 --> 01:50:52,505
The Soviets scrambled MIG's in pursuit
thinking it was a bomber

1940
01:50:52,605 --> 01:50:53,773
It got out okay

1941
01:50:53,873 --> 01:50:55,275
Somebody forgot to cancel the mission

1942
01:50:55,375 --> 01:50:57,977
There's always some sonofabitch
who doesn't get the word!

1943
01:50:58,078 --> 01:50:59,879
This is just what we need

1944
01:51:00,413 --> 01:51:02,248
the Soviets thinking
we're bombing them

1945
01:51:06,152 --> 01:51:07,420
Anybody else?

1946
01:51:07,520 --> 01:51:08,855
Mr. President

1947
01:51:08,988 --> 01:51:11,024
our pilots are in danger

1948
01:51:11,057 --> 01:51:14,894
We must order punitive air strikes
against the SAM site

1949
01:51:14,994 --> 01:51:17,697
that shot down Major Anderson
per our rules of engagement

1950
01:51:32,812 --> 01:51:34,147
No

1951
01:51:35,348 --> 01:51:37,684
I want confirmation
it wasn't some sort of accident first

1952
01:51:37,751 --> 01:51:38,284
Mr. President

1953
01:51:38,418 --> 01:51:42,555
Good idea, Mr. President
I can wait a day and half

1954
01:51:42,689 --> 01:51:45,325
Be safer for my boys
to get the SAM's on Monday

1955
01:51:45,425 --> 01:51:47,160
when we get the rest of the bastards

1956
01:53:34,534 --> 01:53:36,069
That's the quarter!

1957
01:53:42,342 --> 01:53:42,776
Hey, Dad

1958
01:53:42,876 --> 01:53:44,144
Hey, Sport

1959
01:53:44,244 --> 01:53:45,278
You winning?

1960
01:53:45,412 --> 01:53:46,946
Yeah

1961
01:53:47,514 --> 01:53:49,516
Is everything gonna be okay, Dad?

1962
01:53:51,718 --> 01:53:53,787
Everything's gonna be fine, Kenny

1963
01:53:55,155 --> 01:53:59,159
I guess
you won't be coming home tonight?

1964
01:54:01,628 --> 01:54:04,097
I...

1965
01:54:07,233 --> 01:54:10,503
Let's got! Second quarter!

1966
01:54:13,339 --> 01:54:15,675
It's okay. Go on back to your game

1967
01:54:16,076 --> 01:54:18,111
Alright. I'll see you around, Dad

1968
01:54:48,641 --> 01:54:49,709
Dammit!

1969
01:54:52,679 --> 01:54:53,813
Jesus, Mary and Joseph...

1970
01:54:53,913 --> 01:54:55,582
Take off for two hours
you're gonna miss a little drama

1971
01:54:55,715 --> 01:54:57,650
I told you how stupid it was
to float that Lippman article

1972
01:54:57,784 --> 01:54:59,452
Now you're gonna do it for real?

1973
01:54:59,552 --> 01:55:00,687
The Jupiters are obsolete, Kenny

1974
01:55:00,820 --> 01:55:02,188
They were supposed to
have been dismantled last summer

1975
01:55:02,288 --> 01:55:05,091
I know they're obsolete
That's not the point!

1976
01:55:05,525 --> 01:55:08,795
The point is you trade our missiles
in Turkey for theirs in Cuba

1977
01:55:08,962 --> 01:55:11,364
they're gonna force us into
trade after trade, until finally

1978
01:55:11,464 --> 01:55:14,200
a couple of months from now
they demand something we won't trade

1979
01:55:14,334 --> 01:55:15,635
like Berlin

1980
01:55:16,069 --> 01:55:17,704
And we do end up in a war

1981
01:55:18,304 --> 01:55:19,606
Not to mention that
long before that happens

1982
01:55:19,639 --> 01:55:21,708
this administration
will be politically dead

1983
01:55:21,808 --> 01:55:24,844
I don't care if this administration
ends up in the freaking toilet

1984
01:55:24,944 --> 01:55:26,980
We don't do a deal tonight
there won't be any administration

1985
01:55:27,080 --> 01:55:30,183
It's the wrong move, Bobby
and it's not just me who thinks that

1986
01:55:30,316 --> 01:55:33,953
Everyone on this so-called EXCOM's
telling you the same thing

1987
01:55:34,621 --> 01:55:36,923
Whose side are you on now, Ken?

1988
01:55:37,557 --> 01:55:39,893
Oh, goddammit

1989
01:55:41,428 --> 01:55:43,363
What if there
hasn't been a coup at all?

1990
01:55:45,098 --> 01:55:47,067
What if it's you two?

1991
01:55:47,434 --> 01:55:48,201
What is that supposed to mean?

1992
01:55:48,268 --> 01:55:50,003
What if it was you two

1993
01:55:50,103 --> 01:55:54,307
who invited that second letter by
raising the possibility of a trade?

1994
01:56:00,313 --> 01:56:02,782
Mr. President
we have only 30 hours left

1995
01:56:02,916 --> 01:56:04,150
and whatever response we send

1996
01:56:04,284 --> 01:56:06,553
it'll take several hours
to reach our embassy

1997
01:56:06,619 --> 01:56:09,522
and be delievered to the Kremlin

1998
01:56:09,622 --> 01:56:11,925
So early tomorrow morning
is the earliest

1999
01:56:12,058 --> 01:56:13,927
Kruschev could respond

2000
01:56:14,728 --> 01:56:17,297
Which one of you geniuses
is gonna tell me how to

2001
01:56:17,397 --> 01:56:19,599
explain it to the world
if we don't make this trade?

2002
01:56:20,734 --> 01:56:23,169
So what are we gonna say
to the Soviets

2003
01:56:23,269 --> 01:56:25,038
about this offer?

2004
01:56:25,138 --> 01:56:26,306
Well, it depends, doesn't it?

2005
01:56:26,406 --> 01:56:29,943
Do we really believe
there's been a coup?

2006
01:56:30,310 --> 01:56:31,978
What if Fomin wasn't a ploy?

2007
01:56:32,712 --> 01:56:34,514
What if his message was real?

2008
01:56:34,681 --> 01:56:37,951
What if what is happening
is a series of accidents?

2009
01:56:38,084 --> 01:56:41,054
Accidents like them
shooting down our U-2?

2010
01:56:42,355 --> 01:56:43,957
Yes. Accidents like that

2011
01:56:44,391 --> 01:56:46,960
And the accidents are making the
second letter seem more aggressive

2012
01:56:47,594 --> 01:56:51,097
and the whole situation
appear worse than it really is

2013
01:56:51,197 --> 01:56:52,098
"The Gun of August"

2014
01:56:52,165 --> 01:56:53,466
That's right

2015
01:56:53,900 --> 01:56:56,169
So we just reject the second letter?

2016
01:56:56,770 --> 01:56:57,470
No

2017
01:56:58,038 --> 01:56:59,239
We don't...

2018
01:56:59,305 --> 01:57:00,674
reject it

2019
01:57:00,774 --> 01:57:02,075
We accept the first letter

2020
01:57:02,175 --> 01:57:04,411
and pretend
the second one doesn't exist

2021
01:57:06,613 --> 01:57:08,748
It won't work
because that's wishful thinking

2022
01:57:08,882 --> 01:57:10,150
Look, he made an offer. So I...

2023
01:57:10,216 --> 01:57:12,152
The same wishful thinking, Bobby
that blinded us all these months

2024
01:57:12,318 --> 01:57:16,222
while the Soviets were sneaking
those missiles in under our noses

2025
01:57:16,356 --> 01:57:17,457
Ignore the second letter

2026
01:57:17,524 --> 01:57:18,958
agree to the conditions of the first

2027
01:57:19,059 --> 01:57:20,894
There is no reason to believe
the Soviets will let it go

2028
01:57:21,027 --> 01:57:23,329
Max is right. Why will they accept it?

2029
01:57:23,430 --> 01:57:24,698
It can work

2030
01:57:24,764 --> 01:57:28,201
If they believe
we're gonna hit 'em hard

2031
01:57:28,268 --> 01:57:31,404
We've got time for one more round
of diplomacy, and that's it

2032
01:57:31,504 --> 01:57:33,473
First airstrikes start in 28 hours

2033
01:57:33,540 --> 01:57:34,941
But we have to make them agree to it

2034
01:57:35,141 --> 01:57:36,343
So how do we do that?

2035
01:57:36,343 --> 01:57:37,711
We give them something

2036
01:57:37,844 --> 01:57:40,180
We tell them
we'll remove the missiles from Turkey

2037
01:57:40,180 --> 01:57:41,281
Hang on

2038
01:57:41,281 --> 01:57:44,951
But we don that six months from now
so it appears there's no linkage

2039
01:57:45,051 --> 01:57:47,420
We also tell them
if they go public about it

2040
01:57:47,554 --> 01:57:48,254
we'll deny it

2041
01:57:48,355 --> 01:57:49,456
Right we deny it. The deal's off

2042
01:57:49,589 --> 01:57:52,092
And we do it under the table
so we can disavow any knowledge of it

2043
01:57:52,225 --> 01:57:54,594
It's transparent, Kenny
The press will be all over it

2044
01:57:54,694 --> 01:57:57,630
Six months from now
we're not gonna care, are we?

2045
01:57:57,764 --> 01:57:58,498
We'll deal with it then

2046
01:57:58,631 --> 01:58:01,634
At the least, it'll expulse
whether Kruschev has been overthrown

2047
01:58:01,768 --> 01:58:03,002
We'll know who we're up against

2048
01:58:03,103 --> 01:58:04,704
I've been thinking about Kruschev

2049
01:58:04,804 --> 01:58:07,674
And if this is a move to appease
the hard-liners in his government

2050
01:58:07,841 --> 01:58:11,044
it may be just the bone he needs to
regain control of his own house

2051
01:58:11,111 --> 01:58:14,647
Whoever carries the message
has to hit the nail on the head

2052
01:58:14,748 --> 01:58:17,083
If we come across as too soft
they'll push us

2053
01:58:17,150 --> 01:58:20,720
Too hard, they'll be cornered
and even more dangerous

2054
01:58:20,854 --> 01:58:22,756
All of you do understand

2055
01:58:22,856 --> 01:58:25,625
that there is an enormous risk
in offering this deal

2056
01:58:25,759 --> 01:58:27,961
Because if they turn us down
and we've already told them

2057
01:58:28,028 --> 01:58:29,229
that we're coming in on Monday morning

2058
01:58:29,329 --> 01:58:30,196
They'll strike first

2059
01:58:30,296 --> 01:58:31,398
Yes

2060
01:58:34,601 --> 01:58:35,735
Bobby

2061
01:58:36,302 --> 01:58:38,471
You know Dobrynin best

2062
01:58:38,571 --> 01:58:40,840
Yeah

2063
01:58:40,940 --> 01:58:42,375
Then you're it

2064
01:58:44,010 --> 01:58:46,012
Ted, I want you
to start working the draft

2065
01:58:46,446 --> 01:58:49,249
Bobby, you gotta go in there
and make them understand

2066
01:58:49,416 --> 01:58:51,317
that we have to
have an answer tomorrow

2067
01:58:51,384 --> 01:58:53,620
Because Monday we go to war

2068
01:59:10,470 --> 01:59:12,906
What do you want, a goodbye kiss?

2069
01:59:15,775 --> 01:59:17,210
Listen

2070
01:59:17,344 --> 01:59:18,445
I'll take care of him

2071
01:59:18,578 --> 01:59:20,747
Go on inside, grab some coffee
We'll be back pretty quick

2072
01:59:20,847 --> 01:59:21,448
Are you sure?

2073
01:59:21,548 --> 01:59:22,282
Sure

2074
01:59:22,382 --> 01:59:23,983
What's the matter with you?

2075
01:59:24,050 --> 01:59:25,952
Forget how to open a car door?

2076
01:59:28,588 --> 01:59:30,523
Jesus!

2077
01:59:30,590 --> 01:59:32,292
You rich people

2078
01:59:40,834 --> 01:59:44,437
I promised the girls
I'd take them riding tomorrow

2079
01:59:46,106 --> 01:59:49,042
Make sure you keep that date

2080
01:59:51,311 --> 01:59:56,049
We gave up so much to get here

2081
01:59:56,149 --> 01:59:58,318
Sometimes I think
"What the hell did we do it for? "

2082
01:59:58,918 --> 01:59:59,986
I don't know about you

2083
02:00:00,120 --> 02:00:02,922
but I'm in it for the money

2084
02:00:08,795 --> 02:00:12,332
We knew we could do a better job
than everyone else

2085
02:00:12,465 --> 02:00:13,800
Remember?

2086
02:00:14,768 --> 02:00:16,469
You know, I...

2087
02:00:16,603 --> 02:00:21,608
I hate being called the brilliant one

2088
02:00:21,741 --> 02:00:23,743
The ruthless one

2089
02:00:24,210 --> 02:00:26,646
The guy everybody's afraid of

2090
02:00:26,746 --> 02:00:28,181
I hate it

2091
02:00:29,482 --> 02:00:31,384
I'm not so smart

2092
02:00:32,786 --> 02:00:34,254
I'm not so ruthless

2093
02:00:34,688 --> 02:00:37,257
Well, you're right
about the smart part

2094
02:00:46,733 --> 02:00:48,835
I don't know if I can do this

2095
02:00:49,903 --> 02:00:52,472
There's nobody else I'd rather
have going in there than you

2096
02:00:52,605 --> 02:00:56,176
Nobody else I trust

2097
02:00:56,309 --> 02:00:58,244
Helen and the kids' lives to

2098
02:01:00,613 --> 02:01:01,948
Take a left

2099
02:01:21,101 --> 02:01:22,435
You smell that?

2100
02:01:22,969 --> 02:01:24,537
They're burning their documents

2101
02:01:25,972 --> 02:01:27,507
They think we're going to war

2102
02:01:30,310 --> 02:01:32,012
God help us, Ken

2103
02:02:13,319 --> 02:02:16,256
Sir, Ambassador Dobrynin is here
He's in your office

2104
02:02:27,367 --> 02:02:29,302
I'll whistle up some luck for you

2105
02:02:37,911 --> 02:02:39,212
Mr. Ambassador

2106
02:02:39,312 --> 02:02:40,613
Thank you for coming

2107
02:03:30,797 --> 02:03:32,399
Who are you?

2108
02:03:42,776 --> 02:03:44,344
The friend

2109
02:04:05,165 --> 02:04:08,368
My brother, my friends
my countrymen, and I

2110
02:04:08,501 --> 02:04:11,504
cannot and will not permit
those missiles to become operational

2111
02:04:11,638 --> 02:04:12,872
I promise you that

2112
02:04:12,906 --> 02:04:16,476
Then I fear our two nations
will go to war

2113
02:04:16,609 --> 02:04:18,945
And I fear where war will lead us

2114
02:04:19,045 --> 02:04:21,881
If the missiles
do not become operational

2115
02:04:21,948 --> 02:04:25,352
if you remove them
there will be no war

2116
02:04:26,686 --> 02:04:28,955
At this moment, the President
is accepting the terms of

2117
02:04:29,089 --> 02:04:31,558
Secretary Kruschev's letter
of Friday night

2118
02:04:32,025 --> 02:04:34,427
If the Soviet Union
halts construction immediately

2119
02:04:34,494 --> 02:04:37,464
removes the missiles
and submits to U. N. inspection

2120
02:04:37,530 --> 02:04:40,734
the United States
will pledge to never invade Cuba

2121
02:04:40,800 --> 02:04:42,969
or aid others in that enterprise

2122
02:04:43,069 --> 02:04:46,106
If you Jupiter missiles in Turkey
were removed also

2123
02:04:46,206 --> 02:04:48,908
such an accommodation could be reached

2124
02:04:49,242 --> 02:04:50,643
That's not possible

2125
02:04:53,747 --> 02:04:57,250
The United States cannot agree
to such terms under threat

2126
02:04:58,084 --> 02:05:01,421
Any belief to the contrary
was in error

2127
02:05:02,455 --> 02:05:04,691
You want war?

2128
02:05:14,234 --> 02:05:15,468
However

2129
02:05:15,502 --> 02:05:18,505
While there can be no quid pro
on this issue

2130
02:05:18,605 --> 02:05:21,841
the United States
can offer a private assurance

2131
02:05:23,443 --> 02:05:25,979
Our Jupiter missiles in Turkey
are obsolete

2132
02:05:26,146 --> 02:05:29,015
and have been scheduled
for withdrawal for some time

2133
02:05:29,082 --> 02:05:32,986
This withdrawal should take place
within six months

2134
02:05:33,687 --> 02:05:36,022
Of course, any public disclosure
of this assurance

2135
02:05:36,122 --> 02:05:39,492
would negate the deal and produce...

2136
02:05:39,626 --> 02:05:41,695
the most stringent denials
from our government

2137
02:05:41,828 --> 02:05:43,730
This private assurance...

2138
02:05:43,863 --> 02:05:47,300
represents the word
of the Highest Authority?

2139
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:49,336
Yes

2140
02:05:49,402 --> 02:05:52,405
And it can be relayed
beyond Comrade Krushcev's ears

2141
02:05:52,539 --> 02:05:54,441
to the top circles of my government?

2142
02:05:54,507 --> 02:05:58,278
Our pledge can be relayed to
any government officials

2143
02:05:58,378 --> 02:06:00,046
Secretary Kruschev sees fit to satisfy

2144
02:06:00,513 --> 02:06:01,414
With the caveat that...

2145
02:06:01,514 --> 02:06:05,385
it is not to be made public
in any way, shape or form

2146
02:06:09,489 --> 02:06:13,426
And we must have an answer tomorrow
at the latest

2147
02:06:13,526 --> 02:06:15,895
I cannot stress this point enough

2148
02:06:15,996 --> 02:06:17,130
Tomorrow?

2149
02:06:18,832 --> 02:06:19,899
Tomorrow

2150
02:06:22,002 --> 02:06:24,004
Then you must excuse me
and permit me to relay...

2151
02:06:24,070 --> 02:06:27,474
the substance of our discussion
to my superiors

2152
02:06:27,607 --> 02:06:29,075
Of course

2153
02:06:31,111 --> 02:06:35,148
We've heard stories that
some of your military men wish for war

2154
02:06:36,616 --> 02:06:38,485
You are a good man

2155
02:06:38,618 --> 02:06:40,387
Your brother is a good man

2156
02:06:40,453 --> 02:06:43,390
I assure you there are other good men

2157
02:06:43,523 --> 02:06:45,058
Let us hope the will of good men
is enough to counter

2158
02:06:45,225 --> 02:06:49,796
the terrible strength of this thing
that was put in motion

2159
02:07:29,903 --> 02:07:31,871
What's going to happen?

2160
02:07:34,741 --> 02:07:38,345
If the sun comes up tomorrow

2161
02:07:38,478 --> 02:07:41,014
it is only because of men of good will

2162
02:07:43,683 --> 02:07:45,785
And that's...

2163
02:07:45,852 --> 02:07:48,955
all there is between us and the Devil

2164
02:08:21,955 --> 02:08:24,658
This is Radio Moscow

2165
02:08:24,791 --> 02:08:26,259
Premier Kruschev...

2166
02:08:26,393 --> 02:08:29,663
has sent a message
to President Kennedy today

2167
02:08:29,763 --> 02:08:32,465
This message re-emphasizes

2168
02:08:32,565 --> 02:08:36,536
the need for urgent measures
to prevent a fatal turn of events

2169
02:08:36,636 --> 02:08:38,538
and to preserve world peace

2170
02:08:39,205 --> 02:08:42,008
In addition to
instructions earlier transmitted

2171
02:08:42,108 --> 02:08:45,011
to stop construction work
on installations in Cuba

2172
02:08:45,178 --> 02:08:49,249
the Soviet government has ordered
the dismantling of weapons in Cuba

2173
02:08:49,349 --> 02:08:53,019
as well as their crating
and return to the Soviet Union

2174
02:09:04,030 --> 02:09:05,965
Is everybody ready for church?

2175
02:09:13,973 --> 02:09:15,675
It's a beautiful morning

2176
02:09:19,646 --> 02:09:21,348
Pass the butter up to Dad

2177
02:09:26,586 --> 02:09:29,089
Dad, you want your paper?

2178
02:09:32,826 --> 02:09:34,561
Dad, what's wrong?

2179
02:09:39,065 --> 02:09:41,001
The sun came up

2180
02:09:42,569 --> 02:09:46,439
Every day the sun comes up
says something about us

2181
02:09:55,482 --> 02:09:57,584
What does it say, Dad?

2182
02:09:58,918 --> 02:10:01,421
What's wrong with Daddy?

2183
02:10:35,422 --> 02:10:38,425
This is the foreign policy trophy
we were hoping for

2184
02:10:42,329 --> 02:10:43,263
Mr. President

2185
02:10:43,363 --> 02:10:44,631
great job

2186
02:10:44,764 --> 02:10:46,866
Hold it

2187
02:10:46,966 --> 02:10:49,002
Well, Mr. President

2188
02:10:49,135 --> 02:10:51,304
I think I can speak for everyone here

2189
02:10:51,371 --> 02:10:53,873
when I say bring on those mid-terms

2190
02:10:54,007 --> 02:10:57,110
there's no stopping us now

2191
02:10:57,210 --> 02:10:59,646
Four more years! All right!

2192
02:10:59,746 --> 02:11:02,582
You know, it's been a long two weeks

2193
02:11:02,682 --> 02:11:03,883
Whatever

2194
02:11:04,017 --> 02:11:06,886
And I'd like to thank you all
I think you did a great job

2195
02:11:07,020 --> 02:11:11,458
I just don't think
we should be gloating too much

2196
02:11:13,059 --> 02:11:16,930
It was just as much a victory
for them as it was for us

2197
02:11:17,097 --> 02:11:18,531
Hear hear!

2198
02:11:18,698 --> 02:11:19,799
Enjoy your morning

2199
02:11:19,866 --> 02:11:21,468
Thank you, Mr. President

2200
02:11:24,037 --> 02:11:25,905
Get some rest, Mr. President

2201
02:11:26,840 --> 02:11:29,042
We've got a lot of new clout right now

2202
02:11:29,109 --> 02:11:30,477
We can run the table on Kruschev

2203
02:11:30,543 --> 02:11:31,845
the Middle East and Southeast Asia

2204
02:11:31,978 --> 02:11:33,680
You're right

2205
02:11:44,758 --> 02:11:47,894
Dear Mr. and Mrs. Anderson

2206
02:11:47,961 --> 02:11:51,898
I was deeply shocked
when advised your son was lost

2207
02:11:51,965 --> 02:11:56,503
in an operational mission on Saturday

2208
02:11:58,438 --> 02:12:00,140
October 27th, 1962

2209
02:12:00,273 --> 02:12:01,808
Your son rendered distinguished
and dedicated service to his country

2210
02:12:01,975 --> 02:12:03,843
throughout his career

2211
02:12:04,644 --> 02:12:08,648
He was admired

2212
02:12:08,748 --> 02:12:10,650
and respected for his courage

2213
02:12:10,750 --> 02:12:13,653
and his professional skill
by all with whom he served

2214
02:12:14,120 --> 02:12:16,890
His tragic loss will be deeply felt

2215
02:12:17,557 --> 02:12:19,793
and a grateful nation
will be forever in his debt

2216
02:12:40,947 --> 02:12:42,515
Ken! We're out here

2217
02:13:01,601 --> 02:13:04,070
What kind of a peace do we seek?

2218
02:13:04,170 --> 02:13:06,773
I am talking about genuine peace

2219
02:13:06,873 --> 02:13:09,909
The kind of peace that
makes life on earth worth living

2220
02:13:10,010 --> 02:13:12,012
Not merely peace in our time

2221
02:13:12,145 --> 02:13:14,381
but peace in all time

2222
02:13:14,547 --> 02:13:16,516
Our problems are man-made

2223
02:13:16,649 --> 02:13:19,486
therefor they can be solved by man

2224
02:13:19,586 --> 02:13:21,254
For in the final analysis

2225
02:13:21,321 --> 02:13:23,790
our most basic common link

2226
02:13:23,890 --> 02:13:27,794
is that we all
inhabit this small planet

2227
02:13:27,927 --> 02:13:30,063
We all breathe the same air

2228
02:13:30,163 --> 02:13:32,766
We all cherish our children's futures
