1
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,000
Hey, let's order some clubs this weekend?

2
00:00:40,269 --> 00:00:41,549
No club, Ace.

3
00:00:42,113 --> 00:00:44,493
It is a hut in the middle of nowhere.

4
00:00:45,768 --> 00:00:47,508
And do not forget this.

5
00:00:52,951 --> 00:00:54,001
Sorry Jason.

6
00:00:55,412 --> 00:00:58,108
I hope there is enough clean sheets.

7
00:00:58,108 --> 00:01:00,928
Yeah. As if they stayed clean long.

8
00:01:00,928 --> 00:01:04,248
I take a few more washed, just in case.

9
00:01:04,572 --> 00:01:06,930
You will finally tell me who you invited?

10
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:07,620
Okay.

11
00:01:07,861 --> 00:01:10,178
It's too late for you to affect the plans,

12
00:01:10,178 --> 00:01:11,715
I invited a kind of my office

13
00:01:11,715 --> 00:01:12,645
called Mac

14
00:01:13,083 --> 00:01:15,003
It is a kind of computers.

15
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:15,530
Hot?

16
00:01:16,482 --> 00:01:16,942
Warm.

17
00:01:17,707 --> 00:01:18,927
A bit shy.

18
00:01:19,215 --> 00:01:22,115
I think this will be good for him.
It will help you get out.

19
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:23,435
Your turn Coop.

20
00:01:24,876 --> 00:01:26,096
I invited Kevin.

21
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,380
My yoga instructor.

22
00:01:28,775 --> 00:01:29,815
You do yoga?

23
00:01:30,297 --> 00:01:31,397
You do yoga?

24
00:01:31,730 --> 00:01:32,830
Yes, I do yoga.

25
00:01:33,733 --> 00:01:35,966
I have to keep in shape for my boy.

26
00:01:35,966 --> 00:01:37,706
So hurray for yoga.

27
00:01:39,405 --> 00:01:42,092
Maybe he gives us a lesson this weekend weekend.

28
00:01:42,092 --> 00:01:43,022
Yoga nudist.

29
00:01:43,904 --> 00:01:44,414
What?

30
00:01:44,761 --> 00:01:46,451
He teaches yoga nudist.

31
00:01:46,555 --> 00:01:48,065
This is so exciting.

32
00:01:49,534 --> 00:01:50,514
I think not.

33
00:01:52,318 --> 00:01:55,121
Who will be your guest, kid?

34
00:01:55,121 --> 00:01:56,631
It will be a surprise.

35
00:01:57,527 --> 00:01:59,406
He continues to not tell me.

36
00:01:59,406 --> 00:02:00,326
Neither Simon.

37
00:02:00,874 --> 00:02:02,624
Idiot secretive, right?

38
00:02:03,044 --> 00:02:03,384
No.

39
00:02:03,993 --> 00:02:05,903
Simon is an open book.

40
00:02:26,693 --> 00:02:27,153
Simon.

41
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:28,359
Yes

42
00:02:30,206 --> 00:02:32,093
Are you sure you want me to go?

43
00:02:32,093 --> 00:02:32,723
Again?

44
00:02:36,564 --> 00:02:37,544
I'm serious.

45
00:02:39,787 --> 00:02:41,569
What's the end of this weekend?

46
00:02:41,569 --> 00:02:42,609
I told you...

47
00:02:43,377 --> 00:02:45,852
All weekends are long weekends like this.

48
00:02:45,852 --> 00:02:50,422
Jason and I are going with his friend,
Cooper and her boyfriend at the moment

49
00:02:50,422 --> 00:02:52,872
the same place, the same conversations.

50
00:02:53,104 --> 00:02:54,684
Blah... Blah... Blah...

51
00:02:55,054 --> 00:02:56,284
It seems boring.

52
00:02:56,647 --> 00:02:57,037
And it is!

53
00:02:58,174 --> 00:03:00,661
Is why we decided to shake things up.

54
00:03:00,661 --> 00:03:05,077
This end-of-week, four of us,
each invites a friend to go.

55
00:03:05,077 --> 00:03:06,378
The matchmakers do?

56
00:03:06,378 --> 00:03:08,018
Something.

57
00:03:08,249 --> 00:03:09,589
It should be funny.

58
00:03:09,861 --> 00:03:11,551
Or at least different.

59
00:03:12,657 --> 00:03:15,517
God! I'm ready for different.

60
00:03:17,277 --> 00:03:20,390
And are you sure you want me to be your guest?

61
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:24,290
Just do not tell Jason to the frequency with which you see.

62
00:03:25,497 --> 00:03:28,963
You have the strangest in an open relationship I've ever seen.

63
00:03:28,963 --> 00:03:31,643
Open is one thing, my dear Andrew.

64
00:03:32,795 --> 00:03:33,715
You're another.

65
00:03:40,138 --> 00:03:40,658
Wait.

66
00:03:49,192 --> 00:03:52,342
These are the directions to get to the hut.

67
00:03:53,001 --> 00:03:54,101
Do not be late.

68
00:03:55,220 --> 00:03:56,030
Yes, sir.

69
00:04:01,184 --> 00:04:02,394
This is for today.

70
00:04:06,226 --> 00:04:06,976
E. .. ah...

71
00:04:08,104 --> 00:04:11,004
This is the three days of the end-of-week.

72
00:04:17,885 --> 00:04:20,155
It's a business can take pleasure.

73
00:04:44,888 --> 00:04:46,178
END-OF-WEEK LONG

74
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:30,660
Fuck!

75
00:06:51,657 --> 00:06:54,087
Do not worry,
I take the bag.

76
00:06:57,077 --> 00:06:59,867
This is the most incredible site ever!

77
00:07:01,863 --> 00:07:02,812
You think he likes?

78
00:07:02,812 --> 00:07:05,091
I'm not sure.
Kids today are difficult to understand.

79
00:07:05,091 --> 00:07:06,968
That door is my space.

80
00:07:06,968 --> 00:07:08,538
Look, there's a fireplace!

81
00:07:10,290 --> 00:07:11,707
My room usual?

82
00:07:11,707 --> 00:07:13,266
Ready and waiting for you.

83
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:14,918
We stayed with the fourth corner.

84
00:07:14,918 --> 00:07:16,096
What do you mean "we were"?

85
00:07:16,096 --> 00:07:16,676
We were!

86
00:07:16,931 --> 00:07:18,614
As if it were him and had taken?

87
00:07:18,614 --> 00:07:19,867
Do not be ridiculous, I just said...

88
00:07:19,867 --> 00:07:22,524
He'll think we were the best
quarter only because we have first.

89
00:07:22,524 --> 00:07:23,096
We are always.

90
00:07:23,096 --> 00:07:24,306
Is not the issue.

91
00:07:24,954 --> 00:07:25,584
Hello Mac

92
00:07:26,499 --> 00:07:29,440
Hello, this is Cooper.
Cooper this is the Mac, my colleague.

93
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:30,900
Nice to meet you.

94
00:07:31,011 --> 00:07:31,991
You too.

95
00:07:33,802 --> 00:07:35,772
This is my boyfriend, Ace.

96
00:07:36,176 --> 00:07:36,516
Hello

97
00:07:38,087 --> 00:07:41,916
I put my things in the room with double beds.
Can it be?

98
00:07:41,916 --> 00:07:42,786
Are great.

99
00:07:42,864 --> 00:07:45,453
But you'll have to share it with someone.

100
00:07:45,453 --> 00:07:46,143
Okay.

101
00:07:47,224 --> 00:07:48,504
The Cameroon snoring.

102
00:07:49,027 --> 00:07:49,801
Who is Cameroon?

103
00:07:49,801 --> 00:07:50,721
Is my friend.

104
00:07:50,961 --> 00:07:53,033
Yet arrived. We were roommates in college.

105
00:07:53,033 --> 00:07:56,512
And though he moved to the city.
I thought this would be fun for him.

106
00:07:56,512 --> 00:07:59,814
But man... he snores like a fucking train.

107
00:07:59,814 --> 00:08:01,734
He is in the small room.

108
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:04,350
And someone will have to sleep on the couch.

109
00:08:05,749 --> 00:08:08,139
Share with whoever comes next.

110
00:08:10,682 --> 00:08:11,312
I open.

111
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,000
Namaste, my friend.

112
00:08:27,895 --> 00:08:30,055
There is tremendous energy here.

113
00:08:31,343 --> 00:08:35,193
This will be a weekend of wonderful weekend and plainly in public.

114
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:38,469
Even if I do not know any of you.

115
00:08:39,516 --> 00:08:41,276
We enjoy ourselves immensely.

116
00:08:44,093 --> 00:08:44,673
Namaste.

117
00:08:50,167 --> 00:08:50,747
Namaste.

118
00:08:55,926 --> 00:08:57,486
Namaste.
I'm Kevin.

119
00:09:03,149 --> 00:09:05,129
You have an amazing aura.

120
00:09:06,848 --> 00:09:08,188
A haunting?

121
00:09:09,075 --> 00:09:09,595
Well...

122
00:09:10,307 --> 00:09:12,237
Roommates perfect.

123
00:09:21,089 --> 00:09:21,669
So...

124
00:09:22,151 --> 00:09:24,691
We met in freshmen over the course of art history.

125
00:09:24,691 --> 00:09:25,971
History of Art?

126
00:09:26,658 --> 00:09:28,578
Hey! I am a boy enduncado.

127
00:09:28,890 --> 00:09:31,062
Once we went to an art exhibition,

128
00:09:31,062 --> 00:09:32,462
It was so annoying.

129
00:09:32,757 --> 00:09:34,097
Totally in the face.

130
00:09:34,407 --> 00:09:37,016
He could not take the face of graphic images.

131
00:09:37,016 --> 00:09:39,696
Did not believe what he saw, was going to vomit.

132
00:09:39,923 --> 00:09:41,665
On what was the exposure?

133
00:09:41,665 --> 00:09:44,425
Orchids, flowers binding of Georgia

134
00:09:45,034 --> 00:09:48,701
So I ended up making fun of him outside the exhibition.

135
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:50,201
Best friends since then.

136
00:09:50,201 --> 00:09:50,951
Is darling.

137
00:09:52,508 --> 00:09:55,945
It helped a lot, know ourselves, when I came to town.

138
00:09:55,945 --> 00:09:57,925
Despite being married.

139
00:09:58,765 --> 00:10:01,615
"Married" can be a bit strong.

140
00:10:02,292 --> 00:10:03,212
I do not think.

141
00:10:09,514 --> 00:10:10,784
Look at the sky.

142
00:10:12,549 --> 00:10:16,169
Can you feel this as strength to your back?

143
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:25,909
You say I say Cosmo Cosmos
and quickly.

144
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:33,513
This place reminds me of that movie.

145
00:10:34,537 --> 00:10:35,707
"Friday 13th"?

146
00:10:36,166 --> 00:10:37,446
Hopefully not.

147
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:38,730
Tell them what it is.

148
00:10:39,623 --> 00:10:42,143
Native Americans have suffered so much.

149
00:10:43,952 --> 00:10:45,632
"The Boys in the Band"?

150
00:10:45,832 --> 00:10:47,572
No. It was a musical.

151
00:10:47,581 --> 00:10:48,151
O God

152
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:50,769
"Love! Valor! Compassion"?

153
00:10:50,950 --> 00:10:51,520
That's it!

154
00:10:51,830 --> 00:10:52,927
Anything but that.

155
00:10:52,927 --> 00:10:54,777
I will not use a tutu.

156
00:10:58,685 --> 00:10:59,145
No. ..

157
00:11:00,384 --> 00:11:01,834
a group of guys...

158
00:11:01,904 --> 00:11:03,542
a cabin in the woods...

159
00:11:03,542 --> 00:11:04,810
pass the end-to-week.

160
00:11:04,810 --> 00:11:07,200
Yes A group of guys who do not like each other,

161
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:09,439
full of arrogance, sleeping around,

162
00:11:09,439 --> 00:11:09,839
E. ..!

163
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:14,157
dying with AIDS.
We can not do this to this weekend?

164
00:11:14,157 --> 00:11:18,117
I saw this movie was a classic product of its time.

165
00:11:18,473 --> 00:11:20,202
Thank God that time is over.

166
00:11:20,202 --> 00:11:22,592
I do not think you have said that.

167
00:11:22,703 --> 00:11:24,113
Here we go again!

168
00:11:24,113 --> 00:11:26,557
Accepts! We saw always the same in all movies gay.

169
00:11:26,557 --> 00:11:30,675
They were either noble victims of AIDS, or angry
with AIDS, or friends of victims of AIDS.

170
00:11:30,675 --> 00:11:35,591
Yes, because it was the main problem that our
community was facing at the time. Still is.

171
00:11:35,591 --> 00:11:39,794
We really want our legacy
film are stories about death?

172
00:11:39,794 --> 00:11:42,702
They always have the same discussion every six months.

173
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:46,530
At least there is a legacy, not better
a betrayal of the suffering of gays,

174
00:11:46,530 --> 00:11:49,126
brought the total absence of gays in movies?

175
00:11:49,126 --> 00:11:50,885
And Jason will respond with:

176
00:11:50,885 --> 00:11:52,810
At least in the movies gay current

177
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:53,737
That suck!

178
00:11:53,737 --> 00:11:54,668
That is not the point.

179
00:11:54,668 --> 00:11:58,235
At least cover a wide range of topics in general.

180
00:11:58,235 --> 00:11:59,675
No!
He's right!

181
00:12:00,182 --> 00:12:01,812
I rent lots of movies. I mean...

182
00:12:01,812 --> 00:12:02,862
Plenty of movies.

183
00:12:03,214 --> 00:12:04,134
And it's true.

184
00:12:04,182 --> 00:12:07,054
AIDS is a milestone in gay cinema for a long time.

185
00:12:07,054 --> 00:12:12,129
But now we have gay romantic comedies, and.
documentaries about the struggle for equal rights...

186
00:12:12,129 --> 00:12:15,572
and horror movies, and any other topic you like.
I think it's a good thing.

187
00:12:15,572 --> 00:12:19,249
But it decreases where we, our history, and that includes...

188
00:12:19,249 --> 00:12:24,379
films of the past, films about the
death and the struggles of our community.

189
00:12:26,821 --> 00:12:32,340
What I say is that I prefer the "Longtime Companion"
this Ethan Green to make gay.

190
00:12:32,340 --> 00:12:33,900
Everything I say...

191
00:12:33,965 --> 00:12:36,295
do I need another beer.

192
00:12:38,515 --> 00:12:40,145
Aid to the barbecue?

193
00:12:41,625 --> 00:12:42,955
There was a request.

194
00:13:00,922 --> 00:13:05,507
Never heard you speak so passionately
about an issue before.

195
00:13:05,507 --> 00:13:05,907
You?

196
00:13:11,067 --> 00:13:11,407
No.

197
00:13:12,317 --> 00:13:13,067
Do not.

198
00:13:14,352 --> 00:13:16,342
But thanks for asking.

199
00:13:17,065 --> 00:13:23,315
When you reach a certain age, and is
with a particular aspect, assume all soon.

200
00:13:24,302 --> 00:13:25,872
You have friends who are?

201
00:13:29,662 --> 00:13:30,422
Too many.

202
00:13:35,538 --> 00:13:37,079
The Daddy exercises even.

203
00:13:37,079 --> 00:13:37,539
No. ..

204
00:13:38,148 --> 00:13:39,548
... call him that!

205
00:13:40,478 --> 00:13:42,825
Just me is that I can call it that.

206
00:13:42,825 --> 00:13:45,493
Man still can not believe you are with an old man.

207
00:13:45,493 --> 00:13:46,703
He is not old!

208
00:13:47,899 --> 00:13:48,239
It...

209
00:13:48,574 --> 00:13:49,094
mature.

210
00:13:51,806 --> 00:13:53,246
This is your kind now?

211
00:13:53,378 --> 00:13:54,878
He is not a "type".

212
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:55,730
It...

213
00:13:57,955 --> 00:13:59,705
It makes me feel like...

214
00:14:02,179 --> 00:14:02,929
Oh .. No!

215
00:14:03,528 --> 00:14:05,048
You do not understand.

216
00:14:10,212 --> 00:14:11,182
He is the one.

217
00:14:13,332 --> 00:14:15,062
I've been to this before.

218
00:14:16,033 --> 00:14:17,253
It was in college.

219
00:14:18,082 --> 00:14:19,822
It was a stage, nothing more.

220
00:14:21,749 --> 00:14:25,414
Why you do not expect the granddaddy go to sleep...

221
00:14:25,414 --> 00:14:27,744
and sneak up to my room?

222
00:14:27,961 --> 00:14:29,351
It is time to Mecca.

223
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,050
I do not think Cam

224
00:14:33,268 --> 00:14:37,408
I never slept with anyone else since I met Cooper.

225
00:14:38,386 --> 00:14:40,095
How long ago was this?

226
00:14:40,095 --> 00:14:40,895
A year ago.

227
00:14:41,780 --> 00:14:43,060
Are you monogamous now?

228
00:14:45,254 --> 00:14:45,944
Do you like it?

229
00:14:50,095 --> 00:14:50,785
I love it.

230
00:15:07,651 --> 00:15:10,971
So... how do you know each other?

231
00:15:11,773 --> 00:15:15,959
The Jason rented a room in my guesthouse.
When he moved to the city.

232
00:15:15,959 --> 00:15:17,420
You have a guest house?

233
00:15:17,420 --> 00:15:17,880
Easy!

234
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:19,418
It is rented.

235
00:15:21,740 --> 00:15:22,610
A landlord.

236
00:15:23,755 --> 00:15:24,745
So... mature.

237
00:15:28,827 --> 00:15:30,593
I think your friend will not come.

238
00:15:30,593 --> 00:15:31,676
I do not understand what happened.

239
00:15:31,676 --> 00:15:33,476
I spoke with him this morning.

240
00:15:33,722 --> 00:15:35,052
Already here it should be.

241
00:15:37,531 --> 00:15:39,544
So what are the plans for tonight?

242
00:15:39,544 --> 00:15:40,114
That's it.

243
00:15:41,379 --> 00:15:42,818
How about a movie?

244
00:15:42,818 --> 00:15:43,158
No!

245
00:15:43,556 --> 00:15:43,896
No!

246
00:15:46,183 --> 00:15:47,860
A dip in the jacuzzi at night?

247
00:15:47,860 --> 00:15:49,020
It's too cold!

248
00:15:53,226 --> 00:15:55,966
I brought sunscreen creams and skin.

249
00:15:56,406 --> 00:15:59,786
I was expecting a crazy night in the desert...

250
00:16:00,721 --> 00:16:01,181
not...

251
00:16:02,083 --> 00:16:02,204
Exactly.

252
00:16:02,204 --> 00:16:03,144
Tranquility?

253
00:16:04,046 --> 00:16:04,906
Whatever.

254
00:16:05,643 --> 00:16:08,410
We chose this place to escape to the clubs and the crowds.

255
00:16:08,410 --> 00:16:11,910
When you're a little older...
you will enjoy.

256
00:16:12,623 --> 00:16:14,723
It reminds me of where I grew up.

257
00:16:15,518 --> 00:16:16,498
And as I left.

258
00:16:47,569 --> 00:16:49,729
Have you ever tried to do yoga?

259
00:16:50,446 --> 00:16:50,786
No!

260
00:16:52,101 --> 00:16:53,151
I thought about it...

261
00:16:53,546 --> 00:16:56,546
but a bit intimidating when you do not know what you're doing.

262
00:16:56,546 --> 00:16:58,176
Did not want anyone...

263
00:16:58,203 --> 00:16:59,073
judge me.

264
00:16:59,557 --> 00:17:00,957
I can teach you.

265
00:17:01,213 --> 00:17:02,023
Without judging.

266
00:17:03,729 --> 00:17:04,359
Seriously

267
00:17:04,817 --> 00:17:06,667
Bright!
It's what I do.

268
00:17:07,041 --> 00:17:09,779
Share with others, help them relax.

269
00:17:09,779 --> 00:17:10,529
Relax.

270
00:17:11,979 --> 00:17:12,969
I could use.

271
00:17:15,405 --> 00:17:15,625
OK

272
00:17:17,767 --> 00:17:18,287
Tomorrow.

273
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:21,575
You and I, private yoga class.

274
00:17:23,785 --> 00:17:24,895
Deal.

275
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:34,760
It must be my friend.

276
00:17:34,760 --> 00:17:36,602
How did you two meet, anyway?

277
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:38,222
It comes from a long time.

278
00:17:38,726 --> 00:17:42,156
I hope he does not mind sleeping on the couch.

279
00:17:49,736 --> 00:17:50,436
People...

280
00:17:52,183 --> 00:17:52,873
this is...

281
00:17:53,179 --> 00:17:53,639
André!

282
00:17:55,549 --> 00:17:56,069
Andrew?

283
00:17:57,929 --> 00:17:58,389
Andrew?

284
00:18:02,105 --> 00:18:02,975
Hello everybody.

285
00:18:07,646 --> 00:18:08,808
You convidaste a prostitute?

286
00:18:08,808 --> 00:18:09,268
Jason!

287
00:18:09,344 --> 00:18:10,438
For our cabin...

288
00:18:10,438 --> 00:18:11,428
a whore!

289
00:18:11,972 --> 00:18:13,255
A rent boy!

290
00:18:13,255 --> 00:18:15,175
No one calls them that.

291
00:18:17,501 --> 00:18:19,291
Not the subject, I know.

292
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:25,944
It was supposed that somebody knew what he does in life.

293
00:18:25,944 --> 00:18:27,779
How could I guess that our friends...

294
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:30,399
They pay someone to fuck with them?!?

295
00:18:38,453 --> 00:18:40,203
You sit for a moment?

296
00:18:53,864 --> 00:18:58,484
We agreed early in our relationship,
we could sleep with others.

297
00:18:58,718 --> 00:18:59,288
I know!

298
00:19:00,259 --> 00:19:01,129
And we did it!

299
00:19:02,035 --> 00:19:03,195
Both did.

300
00:19:03,286 --> 00:19:07,822
We do not talk about it.
And do not bring them home. Never at home!

301
00:19:07,822 --> 00:19:10,502
Technically, this is not our home.

302
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:15,483
It's as if you wanted to rub in my face...
or worse... show me what I am not!

303
00:19:15,483 --> 00:19:17,453
It is not like that.

304
00:19:22,433 --> 00:19:23,953
You do not understand.

305
00:19:25,116 --> 00:19:25,576
Try it!

306
00:19:33,684 --> 00:19:35,724
I do not have many friends...

307
00:19:37,504 --> 00:19:38,904
even my friends...

308
00:19:41,722 --> 00:19:44,352
those who have also interact,

309
00:19:46,384 --> 00:19:48,814
and you know how my work

310
00:19:49,756 --> 00:19:57,096
nothing but a group of women in middle age,
who just want to municipalities in their meetings Mach.com.

311
00:19:59,359 --> 00:20:01,929
There was no one else to invite.

312
00:20:06,230 --> 00:20:10,550
I had to pay someone to be my friend this weekend to weekend.

313
00:20:18,365 --> 00:20:19,705
You could have told me.

314
00:20:24,358 --> 00:20:26,448
I wish I had done so.

315
00:20:30,029 --> 00:20:33,299
So... extent to which this well know Andrew?

316
00:20:33,692 --> 00:20:35,082
It was a long time.

317
00:20:36,550 --> 00:20:37,710
How long?

318
00:20:38,173 --> 00:20:40,863
Before you being more likely.

319
00:20:41,549 --> 00:20:43,879
He must have started early then.

320
00:20:45,060 --> 00:20:46,740
How much does he charge?

321
00:20:47,836 --> 00:20:50,866
We are neighbors is how long?
Three years?

322
00:20:51,448 --> 00:20:53,237
Yes! I'm on top and below it.

323
00:20:53,237 --> 00:20:55,737
In my building. He lives on top.

324
00:20:56,267 --> 00:20:56,727
Sure.

325
00:20:57,486 --> 00:21:00,796
All beds are occupied.
You'll have to sleep on the couch.

326
00:21:00,796 --> 00:21:03,406
Okay.
I've slept in worse places.

327
00:21:05,194 --> 00:21:07,284
Who wants another drink?

328
00:21:15,403 --> 00:21:18,801
I think we are not allowed friends of lovers in the house.

329
00:21:18,801 --> 00:21:23,111
Or boyfriends who do not bring me a drink are not my friends.

330
00:21:33,076 --> 00:21:33,416
Wow

331
00:21:34,027 --> 00:21:36,915
You are even comfortable with the history of nudity.

332
00:21:36,915 --> 00:21:37,485
Thou?

333
00:21:38,333 --> 00:21:39,773
Well!
Not really.

334
00:21:40,610 --> 00:21:42,480
You should be. Everyone should.

335
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,100
Is what is most natural.

336
00:21:46,008 --> 00:21:51,478
If you are not comfortable in your own skin
and waits to be with someone else?

337
00:21:57,971 --> 00:21:58,311
Hello

338
00:21:59,595 --> 00:21:59,935
Hello

339
00:22:01,300 --> 00:22:02,230
We will....

340
00:22:02,954 --> 00:22:04,584
look at the stars.

341
00:22:04,859 --> 00:22:05,319
Goodbye.

342
00:22:18,231 --> 00:22:20,151
You have everything you need?

343
00:22:21,102 --> 00:22:21,562
Yes.

344
00:22:22,428 --> 00:22:23,068
Thank you.

345
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:32,959
I. .. really regret it.

346
00:22:35,391 --> 00:22:36,771
The fault is not yours.

347
00:22:40,342 --> 00:22:42,562
Simon talks about you constantly.

348
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:43,590
Seriously?

349
00:22:45,662 --> 00:22:46,362
Funny!

350
00:22:47,205 --> 00:22:48,825
He never mentioned you.

351
00:23:01,218 --> 00:23:02,028
I heard you.

352
00:23:04,248 --> 00:23:04,758
What?

353
00:23:05,730 --> 00:23:09,230
I heard you say the name of Andrew when he appeared.

354
00:23:11,818 --> 00:23:12,338
This...

355
00:23:12,843 --> 00:23:15,063
Not have to be ashamed.

356
00:23:16,622 --> 00:23:17,372
I'm not.

357
00:23:18,077 --> 00:23:18,647
Just...

358
00:23:22,063 --> 00:23:24,173
well... I am mortified.

359
00:23:25,470 --> 00:23:27,620
When I moved here, I...

360
00:23:28,380 --> 00:23:30,397
not know where to meet people,

361
00:23:30,397 --> 00:23:32,907
was not frequenter of clubs, e. ..

362
00:23:33,365 --> 00:23:36,115
and most of the staff of the clubs was not interested in me.

363
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,265
Do not despise yourself.

364
00:23:39,316 --> 00:23:40,826
Believed. I do not.

365
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:42,860
Is how things are.

366
00:23:44,581 --> 00:23:45,161
So...

367
00:23:46,431 --> 00:23:48,821
I... was watching one of those...

368
00:23:50,355 --> 00:23:52,165
local gay magazines, e. ..

369
00:23:55,334 --> 00:23:57,074
I saw the announcement of Andrew...

370
00:23:58,144 --> 00:24:01,164
and thought it might be a good way to...

371
00:24:02,956 --> 00:24:03,826
You understand.

372
00:24:04,244 --> 00:24:05,004
Learn...

373
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,298
what they liked.

374
00:24:08,270 --> 00:24:09,260
And you get it?

375
00:24:10,789 --> 00:24:11,949
Largely.

376
00:24:13,581 --> 00:24:15,166
Nothing of value judgments, remember?

377
00:24:15,166 --> 00:24:16,666
'm Not doing.

378
00:24:22,393 --> 00:24:23,073
What is it?

379
00:24:23,877 --> 00:24:24,737
Your aura.

380
00:24:26,018 --> 00:24:27,708
There is so much confidence in it.

381
00:24:29,031 --> 00:24:31,301
But it has been pushed by fear.

382
00:24:32,117 --> 00:24:33,037
Scared of what?

383
00:24:34,183 --> 00:24:36,043
I'm not sure yet.

384
00:24:46,533 --> 00:24:46,873
Yes?

385
00:24:51,597 --> 00:24:52,647
Still awake?

386
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,100
Yes!

387
00:24:58,011 --> 00:24:58,591
Busy?

388
00:25:01,216 --> 00:25:01,966
A bit.

389
00:25:04,631 --> 00:25:06,501
Do you need a hand?

390
00:25:07,075 --> 00:25:07,595
Maybe.

391
00:25:08,951 --> 00:25:10,811
But I must warn you...

392
00:25:11,095 --> 00:25:12,025
I'm broke.

393
00:25:14,865 --> 00:25:15,555
Okay.

394
00:25:16,836 --> 00:25:19,386
The first time is on the house.

395
00:27:24,142 --> 00:27:24,952
My God!

396
00:27:26,234 --> 00:27:28,641
I wish I had their energy at this time of morning.

397
00:27:28,641 --> 00:27:30,831
Someone is feeling her age today?

398
00:27:30,831 --> 00:27:32,712
I did not sleep enough last.

399
00:27:32,712 --> 00:27:33,403
Funny!

400
00:27:33,403 --> 00:27:34,383
I slept well.

401
00:27:37,151 --> 00:27:37,731
Jesus!

402
00:27:38,467 --> 00:27:39,821
You are still arguing?

403
00:27:39,821 --> 00:27:41,215
No. Of course not.
Do not be silly.

404
00:27:41,215 --> 00:27:41,905
A bagel?

405
00:27:46,223 --> 00:27:49,173
I'll see if Kevin and Mac have already agreed.

406
00:27:55,115 --> 00:27:56,805
God! Give him a chance!

407
00:27:57,964 --> 00:27:59,393
It was the worst thing he ever did.

408
00:27:59,393 --> 00:28:00,867
But it is very close.

409
00:28:00,867 --> 00:28:04,127
It seems that you two have more in common for someone besides me.

410
00:28:04,127 --> 00:28:05,637
Do not be so obtuse.

411
00:28:06,586 --> 00:28:08,300
I know your past remember?

412
00:28:08,300 --> 00:28:11,160
Not the boy you have always been well behaved.

413
00:28:14,611 --> 00:28:16,761
What is the story of these two?

414
00:28:16,922 --> 00:28:18,422
Who?
Jason and Simon?

415
00:28:19,508 --> 00:28:20,258
They are rich?

416
00:28:20,966 --> 00:28:22,486
Why do you ask that?

417
00:28:22,641 --> 00:28:24,282
They have this house, right?

418
00:28:24,282 --> 00:28:25,262
I think so.

419
00:28:26,088 --> 00:28:26,948
It's Jason.

420
00:28:28,314 --> 00:28:29,414
Or... Simon.

421
00:28:30,337 --> 00:28:32,307
One... the house is theirs.

422
00:28:33,179 --> 00:28:34,159
Should be good.

423
00:28:35,318 --> 00:28:37,888
Perhaps they need a house-boy.

424
00:28:38,023 --> 00:28:38,483
Kevin!

425
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:41,970
They do not have that kind of relationship.

426
00:28:42,759 --> 00:28:44,209
But sleep outside.

427
00:28:45,265 --> 00:28:46,025
Obviously.

428
00:28:51,911 --> 00:28:55,241
You probably know most of them rotten I am.

429
00:28:56,122 --> 00:28:57,600
How long do you...

430
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:59,000
know... Simon?

431
00:29:00,548 --> 00:29:01,588
A couple of years.

432
00:29:02,377 --> 00:29:04,687
What is it like to do?

433
00:29:06,920 --> 00:29:08,920
Confidentiality of clients.

434
00:29:09,832 --> 00:29:10,822
So tell us?

435
00:29:12,453 --> 00:29:14,093
That old pervert.

436
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:19,000
You want to talk?

437
00:29:27,246 --> 00:29:29,596
We discussed a lot lately.

438
00:29:29,933 --> 00:29:32,358
You have always argued,
but resolved things.

439
00:29:32,358 --> 00:29:32,698
No.

440
00:29:33,244 --> 00:29:37,274
Implicávamos with one another.
Never discussed, not so.

441
00:29:38,343 --> 00:29:38,973
Seriously

442
00:29:41,455 --> 00:29:43,207
Why do not you say something?

443
00:29:43,207 --> 00:29:46,427
Continuous with hopes that things will improve.

444
00:29:46,855 --> 00:29:49,365
What are the reasons for the discussions?

445
00:29:49,733 --> 00:29:50,663
About anything...

446
00:29:51,712 --> 00:29:52,522
about everything.

447
00:30:00,691 --> 00:30:01,971
You know something...

448
00:30:02,592 --> 00:30:04,581
let's take a walk this afternoon.

449
00:30:04,581 --> 00:30:05,731
Just the two.

450
00:30:06,917 --> 00:30:08,827
We talk to the setting sun.

451
00:30:09,201 --> 00:30:10,371
How old?

452
00:30:11,669 --> 00:30:12,839
As before.

453
00:30:14,341 --> 00:30:15,331
Liked it.

454
00:30:16,061 --> 00:30:16,701
Thank you.

455
00:30:21,959 --> 00:30:23,299
Slice these bagles.

456
00:30:24,531 --> 00:30:25,811
Correctly.

457
00:30:28,617 --> 00:30:30,137
Are you awake?

458
00:30:47,763 --> 00:30:49,783
So how are you going and Ace?

459
00:30:49,965 --> 00:30:50,485
Great.

460
00:30:51,405 --> 00:30:52,915
No reason to complain.

461
00:30:53,531 --> 00:30:55,683
Glad you finally joined us.

462
00:30:55,683 --> 00:30:56,023
Yes

463
00:30:57,154 --> 00:31:01,874
He really likes this place,
I am sure you will want to return.

464
00:31:03,978 --> 00:31:05,389
Looking at you now...

465
00:31:05,389 --> 00:31:09,809
is difficult to imagine that you've already been to half a happy couple.

466
00:31:10,966 --> 00:31:16,100
Kevin says I'm trying
rebuild my relationship with Sam.

467
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:18,140
There are worse things to emulate.

468
00:31:18,712 --> 00:31:20,922
Sam was a great person.

469
00:31:21,075 --> 00:31:21,995
There it was.

470
00:31:23,076 --> 00:31:24,396
As is the Ace.

471
00:31:25,725 --> 00:31:27,166
And if Kevin tells...

472
00:31:27,166 --> 00:31:28,386
must be true!

473
00:31:28,983 --> 00:31:30,723
I mean...
seriously...

474
00:31:33,186 --> 00:31:36,276
Look to the skies, all that blue! Wow!

475
00:31:37,528 --> 00:31:38,108
Namaste!

476
00:31:38,650 --> 00:31:39,690
Stop it.

477
00:31:40,226 --> 00:31:43,512
You should come to yoga with me sometimes.
To know him, he is...

478
00:31:43,512 --> 00:31:44,708
enough inside.

479
00:31:44,708 --> 00:31:46,238
No one wants to see me naked.

480
00:31:46,238 --> 00:31:48,228
Especially during yoga.

481
00:31:49,224 --> 00:31:50,734
Simon back with you.

482
00:31:50,846 --> 00:31:52,877
Maybe you give the necessary spark.

483
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:55,858
And give Simon a chance to assess new prey?

484
00:31:55,858 --> 00:31:57,138
It will not happen.

485
00:31:57,548 --> 00:32:00,918
Seriously, you should take a chance on Kevin, you'll like it.

486
00:32:00,918 --> 00:32:02,478
You will not be the only one!

487
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:02,990
Huh?

488
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:07,870
It seems that our Mac likes of Kevin too.

489
00:32:07,883 --> 00:32:09,043
You're kidding!

490
00:32:28,916 --> 00:32:30,486
You were not kidding!

491
00:32:35,595 --> 00:32:37,455
I love this site even.

492
00:32:37,739 --> 00:32:40,649
Not believe that never came here before.

493
00:32:41,231 --> 00:32:42,681
I could live here.

494
00:32:43,769 --> 00:32:45,859
It would be bad for business?

495
00:32:47,941 --> 00:32:49,681
I like to be kept.

496
00:32:49,719 --> 00:32:52,629
Speaking of which...
Good work with the Coop.

497
00:32:52,913 --> 00:32:53,433
Wooff!

498
00:32:54,328 --> 00:32:57,677
I'm not supported!
If this is what you are insinuating.

499
00:32:57,677 --> 00:32:59,307
I work to live.

500
00:33:00,055 --> 00:33:01,145
Doing what?

501
00:33:01,656 --> 00:33:04,076
I am currently serving at the table.

502
00:33:04,076 --> 00:33:05,056
But one day...

503
00:33:05,306 --> 00:33:06,346
'll be an actor.

504
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:07,218
Well!

505
00:33:07,773 --> 00:33:09,463
I used to say that.

506
00:33:10,282 --> 00:33:14,142
Believe me, it's easier to do something else.

507
00:33:14,142 --> 00:33:17,112
How do customers find you right?

508
00:33:17,693 --> 00:33:19,913
Ads, Web pages, normal.

509
00:33:21,426 --> 00:33:22,826
It was hard to get?

510
00:33:23,956 --> 00:33:24,936
Not really.

511
00:33:25,296 --> 00:33:26,156
And it pays well?

512
00:33:28,399 --> 00:33:30,039
Why so many questions?

513
00:33:31,964 --> 00:33:34,654
Are you interested in entering the business?

514
00:33:35,553 --> 00:33:36,073
Maybe.

515
00:33:38,927 --> 00:33:40,197
Man!
Seriously?

516
00:33:42,727 --> 00:33:44,647
The work can be sanded.

517
00:33:45,019 --> 00:33:48,169
Billy takes the minimum wage at this time.

518
00:33:48,638 --> 00:33:52,352
I have no real skills
give me to make some money.

519
00:33:52,352 --> 00:33:52,632
Ouch!

520
00:33:53,221 --> 00:33:54,686
Can not be that bad.

521
00:33:54,686 --> 00:33:55,436
Yes You!

522
00:33:56,644 --> 00:33:57,573
Being a prostitute...

523
00:33:57,573 --> 00:33:58,376
Escort!

524
00:33:58,376 --> 00:33:59,016
Sorry.

525
00:33:59,527 --> 00:34:00,407
Escort.

526
00:34:01,079 --> 00:34:03,581
I get paid to do something I enjoy.

527
00:34:03,581 --> 00:34:08,283
Not what career counselors
always told us to do?

528
00:34:08,283 --> 00:34:08,563
Hey!

529
00:34:08,934 --> 00:34:10,974
You receive more for bareback?

530
00:34:12,120 --> 00:34:13,220
I have no idea!

531
00:34:14,534 --> 00:34:16,624
And you shouldn 't think about it.

532
00:34:17,105 --> 00:34:18,725
I'm serious.

533
00:34:20,039 --> 00:34:20,969
Just asking.

534
00:34:22,380 --> 00:34:23,890
Listen, do not fool yourself.

535
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:24,915
It's work.

536
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:28,395
You should see most of my clients.

537
00:34:28,395 --> 00:34:31,355
They are not all like Cooper or Simon...

538
00:34:31,355 --> 00:34:32,505
or even the Mac!

539
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,505
How are they?

540
00:34:36,125 --> 00:34:37,115
Two words:

541
00:34:37,707 --> 00:34:38,927
Hairs on the back!

542
00:34:51,012 --> 00:34:52,172
Wow Is incredible!

543
00:34:52,696 --> 00:34:56,423
The union of two souls is always a beautiful experience.

544
00:34:56,423 --> 00:34:57,343
Not mine.

545
00:34:57,630 --> 00:35:00,483
I'm not talking about sex, I am
speaking we see us both.

546
00:35:00,483 --> 00:35:02,184
And we got it right?

547
00:35:02,184 --> 00:35:04,100
I'm trying to talk seriously.

548
00:35:04,100 --> 00:35:04,740
Sorry.

549
00:35:05,142 --> 00:35:05,782
Sorry!

550
00:35:06,363 --> 00:35:08,893
I'm not used to conversations in the morning after.

551
00:35:08,893 --> 00:35:10,523
You are accustomed to what?

552
00:35:12,567 --> 00:35:13,611
Uncomfortable conversations condition.

553
00:35:13,611 --> 00:35:18,519
When the type looks much to me in the light of day,
and in no hurry to dress.

554
00:35:18,519 --> 00:35:21,069
I'm not to rush into anything.

555
00:35:21,437 --> 00:35:22,537
I do not know why.

556
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:24,998
You do not know me.

557
00:35:24,998 --> 00:35:25,748
Not yet.

558
00:35:28,001 --> 00:35:30,184
I know some things about you.

559
00:35:30,184 --> 00:35:30,824
Tell me!

560
00:35:32,669 --> 00:35:35,745
I know you got a sense of serenity that I never have;

561
00:35:35,745 --> 00:35:38,355
I know you are much more cool than I;

562
00:35:39,436 --> 00:35:39,776
e. ..

563
00:35:40,589 --> 00:35:45,419
you are comfortable with your body
in a way that I never will be.

564
00:35:47,853 --> 00:35:48,423
Come.

565
00:35:50,770 --> 00:35:51,340
Come.

566
00:35:54,205 --> 00:35:55,475
Tell me what time.

567
00:35:55,584 --> 00:35:56,104
Christ!

568
00:35:56,848 --> 00:35:58,588
Look at your body...

569
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,676
pretend that you are viewing for the first time.

570
00:36:05,065 --> 00:36:06,285
I see a parvinho.

571
00:36:08,385 --> 00:36:10,905
I see a boring, normal, parvinho.

572
00:36:12,859 --> 00:36:15,239
You need to go to a gym.

573
00:36:15,422 --> 00:36:17,812
Let me say what I see.

574
00:36:18,318 --> 00:36:19,888
I see a beautiful eyes,

575
00:36:20,935 --> 00:36:24,485
that have more than what others are capable.

576
00:36:25,027 --> 00:36:29,737
I see a mouth capable of maintaining a
conversation with anyone.

577
00:36:32,354 --> 00:36:33,634
A warm heart,

578
00:36:35,140 --> 00:36:38,460
who cares more about others than you.

579
00:36:38,543 --> 00:36:42,103
I see a very sexy body that I know better.

580
00:36:44,474 --> 00:36:49,324
I see a strong man who needs it recognizes and accepts its strength.

581
00:36:50,835 --> 00:36:51,415
See you!

582
00:36:54,294 --> 00:36:56,324
I see what you see.

583
00:36:57,003 --> 00:36:57,283
OK.

584
00:37:05,612 --> 00:37:08,932
You have not promised me a private yoga lesson?

585
00:37:10,023 --> 00:37:10,363
Yes

586
00:37:11,196 --> 00:37:14,346
Let's start with my towel against your.

587
00:37:21,321 --> 00:37:23,131
Missed breakfast.

588
00:37:25,292 --> 00:37:26,392
I'm not hungry.

589
00:37:26,695 --> 00:37:28,265
You eat at home.

590
00:37:28,512 --> 00:37:29,322
Already eat.

591
00:37:30,752 --> 00:37:31,852
It was expected!

592
00:37:38,730 --> 00:37:40,070
You need something?

593
00:37:42,526 --> 00:37:44,676
You have to avoid me, you know?

594
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:47,515
Do not avoid!

595
00:37:47,764 --> 00:37:48,574
Yes You!

596
00:37:49,610 --> 00:37:51,940
Mal spoke to me last night.

597
00:37:53,328 --> 00:37:53,788
Yes ..

598
00:37:54,033 --> 00:37:57,603
for consideration for the feelings of your partner.

599
00:38:01,499 --> 00:38:02,139
Thank you.

600
00:38:07,363 --> 00:38:10,003
I am sorry to put you in this situation.

601
00:38:12,533 --> 00:38:13,993
You could not guess.

602
00:38:14,436 --> 00:38:15,186
True.

603
00:38:17,220 --> 00:38:20,080
I never realized that you were so popular.

604
00:38:21,398 --> 00:38:23,268
Quality is rewarded.

605
00:38:25,806 --> 00:38:26,846
Give me a hand.

606
00:38:32,168 --> 00:38:32,808
Thank you.

607
00:38:37,186 --> 00:38:41,146
The Jason will do a walk this afternoon with Cooper.

608
00:38:43,197 --> 00:38:45,767
Must be absent for some time.

609
00:38:49,269 --> 00:38:51,119
I'll be at your room.

610
00:39:01,823 --> 00:39:03,033
What's the hurry?

611
00:39:03,656 --> 00:39:05,610
Sorry madam,
forgot that he was going to walk this morning?

612
00:39:05,610 --> 00:39:06,540
Fuck you!

613
00:39:09,426 --> 00:39:11,696
How long have we to walk?

614
00:39:11,960 --> 00:39:12,830
Ten minutes!

615
00:39:14,388 --> 00:39:15,018
Seriously

616
00:39:16,156 --> 00:39:16,616
Crap!

617
00:39:23,340 --> 00:39:25,030
I do not like getting older.

618
00:39:26,154 --> 00:39:28,074
It's better than the alternative.

619
00:39:29,673 --> 00:39:31,682
I did a check-up this week...

620
00:39:31,682 --> 00:39:34,954
and wants my cholesterol or my blood pressure is too high.

621
00:39:34,954 --> 00:39:36,020
God! Really?

622
00:39:36,020 --> 00:39:39,529
The curse of my family genetics are finally catching me.

623
00:39:39,529 --> 00:39:42,425
I'll get a gun and end up with this agony.

624
00:39:42,425 --> 00:39:44,285
Fuck you again!

625
00:39:46,672 --> 00:39:48,242
When I was a kid...

626
00:39:48,358 --> 00:39:49,398
heard my father...

627
00:39:49,398 --> 00:39:50,776
talking with friends,

628
00:39:50,776 --> 00:39:53,586
complain about this evil and that revenue.

629
00:39:54,354 --> 00:39:56,214
Seemed so sad.
Know?

630
00:39:57,670 --> 00:39:59,715
It seemed so old at the time.

631
00:39:59,715 --> 00:40:02,515
Now I'm about to go through the same.

632
00:40:05,346 --> 00:40:06,686
Do you miss him?

633
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:10,999
Will be two years next week.

634
00:40:13,908 --> 00:40:15,948
He would have loved this place.

635
00:40:17,232 --> 00:40:18,042
Yes I would.

636
00:40:20,602 --> 00:40:21,122
Christ!

637
00:40:21,334 --> 00:40:25,166
When you check for me I will be
complain about kids and rap music.

638
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:25,976
It's ridiculous!

639
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:29,600
Yes?

640
00:40:42,289 --> 00:40:44,459
I present myself to the service, sir.

641
00:40:45,535 --> 00:40:46,575
Stop it.

642
00:40:53,129 --> 00:40:54,879
The boys were walking.

643
00:40:56,382 --> 00:40:59,122
Must be absent for a good time.

644
00:40:59,870 --> 00:41:01,620
Any idea in particular?

645
00:41:06,555 --> 00:41:08,465
How do I read about it?

646
00:41:08,939 --> 00:41:10,417
With what? Aging?

647
00:41:10,417 --> 00:41:10,757
Yes

648
00:41:12,006 --> 00:41:13,744
I accept the fact that it has to be.

649
00:41:13,744 --> 00:41:14,575
I'm serious.

650
00:41:14,575 --> 00:41:15,325
Me too.

651
00:41:16,547 --> 00:41:19,047
Age is just a state of mind.

652
00:41:19,047 --> 00:41:21,827
Says the guy with a boyfriend of 25 years.

653
00:41:22,379 --> 00:41:23,779
I've been through enough.

654
00:41:24,035 --> 00:41:25,845
Survived where others did not.

655
00:41:26,544 --> 00:41:30,327
I refuse to feel or act
different just because I have 45 years.

656
00:41:30,327 --> 00:41:31,736
You do not have 48 years?

657
00:41:31,736 --> 00:41:32,860
And now it's my turn...

658
00:41:32,860 --> 00:41:33,790
Fuck you!

659
00:41:34,431 --> 00:41:36,294
I was fine until last year.

660
00:41:36,294 --> 00:41:38,832
And suddenly I started getting that look in bars,

661
00:41:38,832 --> 00:41:39,986
You know what?

662
00:41:39,986 --> 00:41:41,539
The look of "who-is-the-old"?

663
00:41:41,539 --> 00:41:42,359
Exactly!

664
00:41:42,833 --> 00:41:46,789
And suddenly all seem young,
young and even younger.

665
00:41:46,789 --> 00:41:48,915
Yes, but does it matter?
Are you Simon!

666
00:41:48,915 --> 00:41:49,835
Fuck.

667
00:41:51,959 --> 00:41:53,292
Well .. there is only one thing to do.

668
00:41:53,292 --> 00:41:53,862
Whats up

669
00:41:54,606 --> 00:41:58,866
Make room in a retirement home and learn to play bridge.

670
00:42:02,604 --> 00:42:04,846
Mind if I go back earlier?

671
00:42:04,846 --> 00:42:07,095
I would like to spend some time with Simon.

672
00:42:07,095 --> 00:42:07,785
Okay.

673
00:42:23,940 --> 00:42:27,066
I do not believe you have never had a massage.

674
00:42:27,066 --> 00:42:30,746
Just the thought of someone touching me used to scare me.

675
00:42:30,792 --> 00:42:31,612
"I used to?

676
00:42:32,723 --> 00:42:33,063
Yes

677
00:42:34,174 --> 00:42:34,874
Used.

678
00:42:35,975 --> 00:42:37,945
It is a good way to relax.

679
00:42:38,517 --> 00:42:40,967
Release toxins from your system.

680
00:42:43,202 --> 00:42:47,282
My work is almost therapeutic.
It is true that matter.

681
00:42:47,688 --> 00:42:50,708
Is there some kind of joke with a happy ending here?

682
00:42:51,588 --> 00:42:51,716
I can not imagine that.

683
00:42:51,716 --> 00:42:54,746
I am sure you will eventually get there.

684
00:42:55,193 --> 00:42:58,474
You know, my mother would say that you are a bad influence.

685
00:42:58,474 --> 00:43:00,814
I can give you a massage too.

686
00:43:01,887 --> 00:43:04,517
This is wrong in so many ways...

687
00:43:04,940 --> 00:43:06,954
I bet you're closer to your father, is not Mac?

688
00:43:06,954 --> 00:43:07,294
Yes

689
00:43:08,604 --> 00:43:13,264
I know it's not cool to say, but my parents are fantastic.

690
00:43:13,317 --> 00:43:14,127
They know?

691
00:43:14,852 --> 00:43:16,002
I'm gay?

692
00:43:16,321 --> 00:43:19,101
Sim.
Already known for some time.

693
00:43:19,304 --> 00:43:19,704
E. ..?

694
00:43:20,542 --> 00:43:21,522
E.... And nothing.

695
00:43:23,371 --> 00:43:25,351
They love me. They are my parents.

696
00:43:25,696 --> 00:43:26,676
Should be good.

697
00:43:29,563 --> 00:43:31,303
And about your family?

698
00:43:33,719 --> 00:43:34,879
My family?

699
00:43:36,032 --> 00:43:36,902
Lets see...

700
00:43:37,238 --> 00:43:38,388
There's my brother

701
00:43:40,013 --> 00:43:41,873
he joined his friends,

702
00:43:41,926 --> 00:43:44,946
and beat me up when I knew I was gay.

703
00:43:48,692 --> 00:43:49,492
My father

704
00:43:51,072 --> 00:43:53,342
drove me home at 17.

705
00:43:56,420 --> 00:43:57,740
And there's my mother,

706
00:43:59,622 --> 00:44:01,992
that returned all my letters unopened.

707
00:44:01,992 --> 00:44:04,672
After ten years finally gave up.

708
00:44:06,291 --> 00:44:07,691
I very much Kevin.

709
00:44:10,058 --> 00:44:11,717
Everything happens for a reason.

710
00:44:11,717 --> 00:44:13,337
The past is the past.

711
00:44:14,765 --> 00:44:19,515
And it led me here to meet someone with thoughts of love

712
00:44:19,515 --> 00:44:21,085
and a loving family.

713
00:44:22,689 --> 00:44:24,539
You're a lucky man Mac

714
00:44:25,539 --> 00:44:25,879
Yes

715
00:44:27,328 --> 00:44:28,308
I think I am.

716
00:44:35,601 --> 00:44:37,233
I'll talk to the Ace for a while.

717
00:44:37,233 --> 00:44:37,993
Enjoy.

718
00:44:38,588 --> 00:44:39,338
You too.

719
00:44:52,255 --> 00:44:54,551
A dollar and a half for your thoughts.

720
00:44:54,551 --> 00:44:56,361
What happened to walking?

721
00:44:57,544 --> 00:45:00,044
The Jason was not even order it.

722
00:45:01,226 --> 00:45:02,545
He is quite old.

723
00:45:02,545 --> 00:45:03,125
Care!

724
00:45:06,789 --> 00:45:08,189
Something wrong?

725
00:45:08,720 --> 00:45:09,060
No.

726
00:45:11,017 --> 00:45:14,407
I got it because you are so fond of this place.

727
00:45:14,501 --> 00:45:15,421
It's so peaceful.

728
00:45:16,859 --> 00:45:19,769
It is a great place to think about things.

729
00:45:20,703 --> 00:45:21,563
Like what?

730
00:45:22,708 --> 00:45:23,928
Ahhh, you know...

731
00:45:24,173 --> 00:45:24,863
Life...

732
00:45:25,765 --> 00:45:26,695
the universe...

733
00:45:29,320 --> 00:45:29,720
Everything.

734
00:45:31,641 --> 00:45:33,331
So nothing serious, right?

735
00:45:37,395 --> 00:45:39,835
How long have you come here?

736
00:45:41,790 --> 00:45:42,480
God!

737
00:45:44,576 --> 00:45:45,326
Seven years.

738
00:45:48,140 --> 00:45:49,180
I want it.

739
00:45:51,120 --> 00:45:52,510
I want to return here.

740
00:45:53,761 --> 00:45:54,811
Back to you.

741
00:45:56,560 --> 00:45:58,770
I want to be part of your group.

742
00:45:59,037 --> 00:46:01,597
And not just your last achievement.

743
00:46:04,886 --> 00:46:05,576
Thou shalt.

744
00:46:07,722 --> 00:46:08,232
Thou.

745
00:46:10,752 --> 00:46:12,552
What purpose does this come from?

746
00:46:13,300 --> 00:46:15,690
It was something you said to Cameroon.

747
00:46:16,231 --> 00:46:19,321
About getting to know Jason twenty years...

748
00:46:22,233 --> 00:46:22,863
And?

749
00:46:24,342 --> 00:46:28,139
You know I do not care about our age difference.

750
00:46:28,139 --> 00:46:28,839
Except...

751
00:46:35,237 --> 00:46:36,277
Except what?

752
00:46:38,618 --> 00:46:40,778
Except when I think of the future.

753
00:46:46,411 --> 00:46:49,901
Are you afraid to take care of me in my old age?

754
00:46:50,149 --> 00:46:50,899
God! No!

755
00:46:55,249 --> 00:46:56,989
I'm afraid to lose you!

756
00:46:57,427 --> 00:47:00,357
Before we have time together.

757
00:47:01,609 --> 00:47:04,529
I mean... I have twenty years to you?

758
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:09,519
Or you'll get sick of me long before that?

759
00:47:20,855 --> 00:47:23,465
Nobody knows what the future will be.

760
00:47:28,208 --> 00:47:29,538
But this I know...

761
00:47:31,899 --> 00:47:36,509
I had the great fortune to really love two men in my life...

762
00:47:39,500 --> 00:47:41,010
One when he was young...

763
00:47:44,669 --> 00:47:45,529
And now you.

764
00:47:52,595 --> 00:47:56,485
You're everything I need for the rest of my life.

765
00:47:58,557 --> 00:47:59,777
And after that...

766
00:48:01,793 --> 00:48:03,728
You'll find someone else.

767
00:48:03,728 --> 00:48:04,068
No!

768
00:48:06,823 --> 00:48:07,513
Okay!

769
00:48:13,156 --> 00:48:17,176
It's something we will not have to think for a long, long time.

770
00:49:10,473 --> 00:49:11,563
It's my turn!

771
00:50:20,189 --> 00:50:22,529
Damn! I must have left me to sleep.

772
00:50:25,400 --> 00:50:27,080
Where is everybody?

773
00:50:29,327 --> 00:50:29,667
Hello?

774
00:50:31,579 --> 00:50:31,979
Hello?

775
00:50:37,904 --> 00:50:38,544
You like?

776
00:50:41,657 --> 00:50:43,227
I understand you see it.

777
00:50:45,428 --> 00:50:48,278
And I know what I would like to see it now.

778
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:48,908
Seriously

779
00:50:51,524 --> 00:50:53,734
Why do not you take a shower?

780
00:50:54,841 --> 00:50:55,351
What?

781
00:50:56,343 --> 00:50:57,043
Clean up.

782
00:50:58,341 --> 00:50:59,381
Drink a glass.

783
00:51:00,579 --> 00:51:01,629
Anything.

784
00:51:05,075 --> 00:51:06,235
We were right.

785
00:51:34,802 --> 00:51:35,082
15!

786
00:51:37,238 --> 00:51:37,518
20!

787
00:51:38,341 --> 00:51:38,621
21!

788
00:51:40,370 --> 00:51:40,650
17!

789
00:51:43,106 --> 00:51:43,386
26!

790
00:51:46,315 --> 00:51:46,595
13!

791
00:51:48,176 --> 00:51:48,511
Bullshit!

792
00:51:48,511 --> 00:51:49,031
Thirteen?

793
00:51:49,102 --> 00:51:50,682
Assumed you thirteen?

794
00:51:50,769 --> 00:51:53,619
Hey! If you like wood, wood you like.

795
00:51:53,946 --> 00:51:55,017
Truth!
Truth!

796
00:51:55,017 --> 00:51:57,447
What wood did you enjoy the 13?

797
00:51:57,656 --> 00:51:58,466
From Gregory.

798
00:51:58,794 --> 00:52:00,424
Do your cousin Gregory??

799
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:01,621
This is sexy.

800
00:52:01,621 --> 00:52:02,251
It relays.

801
00:52:03,156 --> 00:52:05,807
I met Gregory,
is definitely sexy.

802
00:52:05,807 --> 00:52:07,077
He is also gay?

803
00:52:07,340 --> 00:52:10,300
The florist in San Francisco.
What do you think?

804
00:52:11,032 --> 00:52:13,397
I think you should invite to a trio.

805
00:52:13,397 --> 00:52:17,277
No more groups for me.
I am a man of one man.

806
00:52:33,685 --> 00:52:35,715
When will you marry?

807
00:52:36,578 --> 00:52:38,028
So what is legal.

808
00:52:38,111 --> 00:52:40,888
Well! As if that were to succeed in the near future.

809
00:52:40,888 --> 00:52:43,227
It may not happen so fast...

810
00:52:43,227 --> 00:52:44,507
but it will happen.

811
00:52:46,712 --> 00:52:48,510
You are all so cynical.

812
00:52:48,510 --> 00:52:49,680
Only realistic.

813
00:52:50,547 --> 00:52:52,779
When you two make a
those commitment ceremonies?

814
00:52:52,779 --> 00:52:55,529
Why? It means nothing legally.

815
00:52:55,888 --> 00:52:56,446
It is symbolic.

816
00:52:56,446 --> 00:53:02,448
The symbolism does not protect from nurses that homophobic
do not let you see your partner if he is in the hospital.

817
00:53:02,448 --> 00:53:05,656
Or you protect your family back to your partner crazy.

818
00:53:05,656 --> 00:53:07,493
That's what good are lawyers.

819
00:53:07,493 --> 00:53:08,450
And a will.

820
00:53:08,450 --> 00:53:09,618
And a will made in life.

821
00:53:09,618 --> 00:53:10,948
And a good lawyer.

822
00:53:11,682 --> 00:53:13,662
And hire a good lawyer.

823
00:53:13,912 --> 00:53:14,902
So romantic!

824
00:53:16,438 --> 00:53:20,168
Do you think that a ceremony makes you a couple?

825
00:53:20,272 --> 00:53:26,851
Simon and I have spent thousands of dollars just to protect ourselves in case something...

826
00:53:26,851 --> 00:53:29,251
in the event something happens.

827
00:53:29,294 --> 00:53:30,504
And it is worth?

828
00:53:42,262 --> 00:53:43,302
Sure.

829
00:53:45,816 --> 00:53:48,536
I do not care if it is legal or not.

830
00:53:50,279 --> 00:53:52,209
I want to marry me any day.

831
00:53:56,389 --> 00:53:57,549
Maybe you cases.

832
00:53:58,817 --> 00:53:59,397
Contigo!

833
00:54:02,262 --> 00:54:03,422
Maybe you cases.

834
00:54:05,886 --> 00:54:08,388
I do not care if I ever marry.

835
00:54:08,388 --> 00:54:09,248
That's good.

836
00:54:10,591 --> 00:54:12,923
Has anyone seen Kevin or Mac today?

837
00:54:12,923 --> 00:54:13,843
I have not seen...

838
00:54:14,385 --> 00:54:16,265
but definitely heard them.

839
00:54:16,432 --> 00:54:17,062
Seriously

840
00:54:18,283 --> 00:54:18,623
Yes

841
00:54:19,590 --> 00:54:21,160
You know what would meditate?

842
00:54:21,213 --> 00:54:24,843
Well, "Namaste" means "I'll come" in yoga.

843
00:54:29,814 --> 00:54:31,034
Good for them.

844
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:41,479
Yes, fine for them.

845
00:55:34,501 --> 00:55:35,371
Going to sleep?

846
00:55:36,844 --> 00:55:37,604
Obviously.

847
00:55:38,822 --> 00:55:40,417
What is your problem?

848
00:55:40,417 --> 00:55:40,937
None!

849
00:55:41,229 --> 00:55:43,480
So why the fuck are you be so stupid to this weekend?

850
00:55:43,480 --> 00:55:43,880
I??

851
00:55:44,727 --> 00:55:46,448
What was it this afternoon?

852
00:55:46,448 --> 00:55:46,958
What?

853
00:55:47,193 --> 00:55:51,214
I join with you and your whore
for an afternoon of consensual sex?

854
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:52,666
Is not that what we do.

855
00:55:52,666 --> 00:55:53,791
Maybe we should!

856
00:55:53,791 --> 00:55:55,278
It's all very good, but...

857
00:55:55,278 --> 00:55:57,133
second thought, you know it well!

858
00:55:57,133 --> 00:55:58,461
We have a deal!

859
00:55:58,461 --> 00:55:59,975
I did nothing wrong!

860
00:55:59,975 --> 00:56:00,315
No.

861
00:56:00,544 --> 00:56:04,045
You never doing anything wrong.
Not here, not at home. Never!

862
00:56:04,045 --> 00:56:04,903
You are perfect!

863
00:56:04,903 --> 00:56:06,420
I never said that was!

864
00:56:06,420 --> 00:56:07,525
That is not the case!

865
00:56:07,525 --> 00:56:08,461
So what is the case?

866
00:56:08,461 --> 00:56:09,321
The case is...

867
00:56:10,357 --> 00:56:12,087
I fuck if I know!

868
00:56:23,196 --> 00:56:25,176
Are you not tired of discussing?

869
00:56:29,021 --> 00:56:31,231
You're not sick of me cause?

870
00:56:35,572 --> 00:56:38,942
Are you not tired of pretending you're better than me?

871
00:56:39,816 --> 00:56:40,806
Away from me?

872
00:56:41,594 --> 00:56:47,084
When it suits your purposes.
And then you ask excuse when you feel alone.

873
00:56:52,296 --> 00:56:55,026
You're not tired of pretending that you love me?

874
00:56:58,783 --> 00:57:00,463
As much as I love you?

875
00:57:13,105 --> 00:57:13,445
Yes!

876
00:57:15,612 --> 00:57:16,072
I!

877
00:58:23,357 --> 00:58:23,697
Hello!

878
00:58:26,956 --> 00:58:28,103
What is going on?

879
00:58:28,103 --> 00:58:28,503
Nothing!

880
00:58:34,817 --> 00:58:36,567
You have enough meat there?

881
00:58:39,178 --> 00:58:39,518
Yes

882
00:58:39,954 --> 00:58:40,414
Sure.

883
00:58:41,807 --> 00:58:44,723
Kevin believes a diet of high protein value.

884
00:58:44,723 --> 00:58:46,463
I sure hope so.

885
00:58:47,689 --> 00:58:48,329
Thank you.

886
00:58:49,204 --> 00:58:50,014
You know...

887
00:58:50,606 --> 00:58:51,886
for inviting me.

888
00:58:52,067 --> 00:58:55,026
This has been the best weekend ever weeks.

889
00:58:55,026 --> 00:58:56,354
Glad you're going through a good bit.

890
00:58:56,354 --> 00:58:56,694
Good?

891
00:58:57,305 --> 00:58:59,148
"Good" or even used to describe it.

892
00:58:59,148 --> 00:59:03,318
I mean, I feel a completely different person here.

893
00:59:03,328 --> 00:59:05,851
As if he could do whatever I want.

894
00:59:05,851 --> 00:59:08,109
Usually have that effect on people.

895
00:59:08,109 --> 00:59:10,039
Can I ask you a question?

896
00:59:10,207 --> 00:59:10,667
Strength

897
00:59:12,219 --> 00:59:12,679
You....

898
00:59:14,214 --> 00:59:14,724
What?

899
00:59:17,482 --> 00:59:18,872
You arranged this?

900
00:59:18,872 --> 00:59:20,420
I mean, you thought that Kevin and I...

901
00:59:20,420 --> 00:59:21,420
Honestly...

902
00:59:22,115 --> 00:59:25,158
had never met Kevin before the end of this weekend.

903
00:59:25,158 --> 00:59:26,558
Cooper invited him.

904
00:59:28,132 --> 00:59:31,300
But I have a feeling we'll see you more often.

905
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:31,640
Yes

906
00:59:32,113 --> 00:59:32,863
Me too.

907
00:59:33,453 --> 00:59:35,834
Remind me to send Cooper a thank you card.

908
00:59:35,834 --> 00:59:37,394
Or a basket of cakes.

909
00:59:37,864 --> 00:59:39,254
He likes to carp?

910
00:59:39,393 --> 00:59:40,733
He prefers chicken.

911
00:59:50,587 --> 00:59:53,507
Listen... I know that you are still in the closet at work.

912
00:59:53,507 --> 00:59:55,077
No. Not in the closet...

913
00:59:55,827 --> 00:59:57,259
But it is reality, right?

914
00:59:57,259 --> 00:59:59,059
I always thought it was someone else's problem.

915
00:59:59,059 --> 00:59:59,739
And it is not.

916
01:00:00,103 --> 01:00:07,003
Actually I was a little surprised when you invited me,
always thought it was a bit macho.

917
01:00:07,354 --> 01:00:08,700
Ok, maybe not. But...

918
01:00:08,700 --> 01:00:13,281
I am grateful that you have asked me instead
the presumption to speak on my back.

919
01:00:13,281 --> 01:00:14,904
It takes one to know another, right?

920
01:00:14,904 --> 01:00:16,234
Yes, I think so.

921
01:00:18,532 --> 01:00:19,540
Anyway...

922
01:00:19,540 --> 01:00:22,990
for the week when we go back to the office,

923
01:00:23,065 --> 01:00:24,568
You can rely on my discretion.

924
01:00:24,568 --> 01:00:27,698
I'm not talking about you or this weekend the weekend.

925
01:00:28,214 --> 01:00:28,854
Thank you.

926
01:00:29,305 --> 01:00:30,755
But you know what?

927
01:00:31,877 --> 01:00:32,387
What?

928
01:00:33,443 --> 01:00:34,483
It's okay.

929
01:00:36,022 --> 01:00:37,882
I will not think about them.

930
01:00:38,028 --> 01:00:40,238
You can tell whoever you want.

931
01:00:52,842 --> 01:00:53,482
Thank you.

932
01:00:55,597 --> 01:00:57,347
I will never forget it.

933
01:03:01,417 --> 01:03:03,148
Are you sure you're ready for this?

934
01:03:03,148 --> 01:03:04,699
What did you say?

935
01:03:04,699 --> 01:03:06,411
I have to face my fears.

936
01:03:06,411 --> 01:03:08,454
Or your fears will face you.

937
01:03:08,454 --> 01:03:11,686
So why...
this has to be my greatest fear?

938
01:03:11,686 --> 01:03:14,715
Because we are taught since childhood to be ashamed of our bodies.

939
01:03:14,715 --> 01:03:19,445
You must overcome this fear if you want to be at peace with yourself.

940
01:03:22,392 --> 01:03:24,625
You are only vanities, do you know that?

941
01:03:24,625 --> 01:03:25,384
Are you ready?

942
01:03:25,384 --> 01:03:25,844
Yes.

943
01:03:28,818 --> 01:03:31,198
Anybody want to go naked to the jacuzzi?

944
01:03:41,335 --> 01:03:44,135
Anyone for a little jacuzzi morning?

945
01:03:46,833 --> 01:03:47,413
Nobody?

946
01:03:51,178 --> 01:03:52,918
Seems it's just us.

947
01:03:53,641 --> 01:03:55,971
Farewell to face my fears.

948
01:05:23,638 --> 01:05:24,388
I'm fine!

949
01:05:25,020 --> 01:05:25,480
Seriously!

950
01:05:27,908 --> 01:05:28,658
He returns.

951
01:05:35,128 --> 01:05:37,927
If I had something to do with this sorry lot.

952
01:05:37,927 --> 01:05:39,497
Of course you had not!

953
01:05:43,441 --> 01:05:44,371
But thank you.

954
01:05:52,568 --> 01:05:54,178
My name is Mac

955
01:05:55,523 --> 01:05:57,843
It is a nickname.
E. .. me hate it.

956
01:06:02,072 --> 01:06:02,822
Well!

957
01:06:03,464 --> 01:06:05,436
But it's what everyone call you at work.

958
01:06:05,436 --> 01:06:05,776
Yes

959
01:06:06,501 --> 01:06:09,541
But... I never wanted to correct one before.

960
01:06:09,613 --> 01:06:11,873
I think I will go to do.

961
01:06:14,673 --> 01:06:16,883
You know my real name?

962
01:06:17,311 --> 01:06:17,711
It....

963
01:06:19,774 --> 01:06:20,934
Crap!
Sorry.

964
01:06:22,594 --> 01:06:24,154
How's your name?

965
01:06:26,865 --> 01:06:27,555
It Hamish!

966
01:06:32,299 --> 01:06:33,919
And prefer it to Mac?

967
01:06:36,586 --> 01:06:37,106
Hamish!

968
01:06:38,197 --> 01:06:38,887
I like it.

969
01:06:42,242 --> 01:06:44,622
So why do they call you Mac?

970
01:06:46,254 --> 01:06:51,514
There was a TV series, a long time,
people loved to tell me.

971
01:06:54,159 --> 01:06:55,439
Yet realized.

972
01:06:57,822 --> 01:06:59,038
It is my full name.

973
01:06:59,038 --> 01:06:59,438
It....

974
01:06:59,981 --> 01:07:01,441
Hamish Wallace Gyver.

975
01:07:05,623 --> 01:07:06,373
Like...

976
01:07:06,755 --> 01:07:07,685
Mac .. Gyver?

977
01:07:08,770 --> 01:07:09,470
MacGyver?

978
01:07:18,024 --> 01:07:19,304
Still not got it!

979
01:07:20,340 --> 01:07:20,860
Kids!

980
01:07:26,141 --> 01:07:29,391
Your aura was not compatible with the name Mac

981
01:07:31,166 --> 01:07:33,426
So what's the plan for today?

982
01:07:34,085 --> 01:07:35,897
I thought that there were no plans.

983
01:07:35,897 --> 01:07:38,374
Fuck that.
I need work...

984
01:07:38,374 --> 01:07:39,944
and need friends.

985
01:07:41,593 --> 01:07:43,103
Let's take a walk.

986
01:07:43,837 --> 01:07:44,997
A walk is.

987
01:07:46,175 --> 01:07:47,762
You come with us for a change?

988
01:07:47,762 --> 01:07:50,912
Yes, do some exercise stand for a change.

989
01:07:51,975 --> 01:07:53,135
We have done it.

990
01:07:56,900 --> 01:07:59,976
Well!
In a 5 minutes all out there.

991
01:07:59,976 --> 01:08:01,952
Who needs to change?

992
01:08:01,952 --> 01:08:02,882
Sure. Come!

993
01:08:17,974 --> 01:08:20,972
It's been 10 minutes.
You'll get old fart?

994
01:08:20,972 --> 01:08:21,552
Shut up!

995
01:08:22,423 --> 01:08:23,233
Give me water!

996
01:08:24,346 --> 01:08:26,315
Are you sure that you can not run with the tenants?

997
01:08:26,315 --> 01:08:27,945
I will work to Cooper.

998
01:08:29,083 --> 01:08:30,473
Nature is so...

999
01:08:30,767 --> 01:08:32,010
... Natural!
Do not you think?

1000
01:08:32,010 --> 01:08:33,980
I would not have said it better.

1001
01:08:36,251 --> 01:08:37,941
Yes .. this is fun!

1002
01:08:40,296 --> 01:08:43,156
Free the mind of all thoughts.

1003
01:08:45,961 --> 01:08:49,651
Concentrate on the noise made by wind in the trees.

1004
01:08:51,268 --> 01:08:54,188
Feel the presence of those around you.

1005
01:08:55,125 --> 01:08:56,755
Feel their energy.

1006
01:08:57,784 --> 01:08:59,234
Feel their love.

1007
01:09:02,566 --> 01:09:03,606
Stop it!

1008
01:09:03,758 --> 01:09:06,078
But I wanted to feel your love.

1009
01:09:07,408 --> 01:09:08,338
Let go.

1010
01:09:10,699 --> 01:09:13,969
Feel the negative energy out of each exhalation.

1011
01:09:16,118 --> 01:09:19,798
Feel the life force of these woods and penetrate you.

1012
01:09:21,355 --> 01:09:22,235
Concentrate!

1013
01:09:26,516 --> 01:09:28,386
Now a final inspiration.

1014
01:09:32,392 --> 01:09:35,312
Think of all the possibilities of life.

1015
01:09:53,129 --> 01:09:55,023
I know this is not easy.

1016
01:09:55,023 --> 01:09:56,201
Can I do anything?

1017
01:09:56,201 --> 01:09:57,951
'm Not in the mood.

1018
01:09:58,017 --> 01:09:59,927
I'm not talking about sex.

1019
01:10:01,162 --> 01:10:03,262
I'm talking about... talk.

1020
01:10:03,746 --> 01:10:06,146
I'm really an excellent listener.

1021
01:10:07,848 --> 01:10:10,828
Simon told you things... about me?

1022
01:10:10,979 --> 01:10:12,019
About us?

1023
01:10:13,662 --> 01:10:15,580
It would be strange to you?

1024
01:10:15,580 --> 01:10:17,090
No. Not at all.

1025
01:10:17,259 --> 01:10:20,639
Hearing both sides maybe I can help.

1026
01:10:20,652 --> 01:10:21,922
I'm not gonna pay.

1027
01:10:24,946 --> 01:10:25,986
At least now.

1028
01:10:37,236 --> 01:10:39,276
I do not want to reality.

1029
01:10:39,871 --> 01:10:42,302
The reality follows you where to go.

1030
01:10:42,302 --> 01:10:43,752
Not taught you anything?

1031
01:10:44,432 --> 01:10:46,062
I speak in fact real.

1032
01:10:46,534 --> 01:10:47,934
This site seems...

1033
01:10:48,206 --> 01:10:49,846
a hidden reality.

1034
01:10:50,477 --> 01:10:52,697
Are you saying that the cabin is like the Matrix?

1035
01:10:52,697 --> 01:10:53,517
Exactly!

1036
01:10:55,122 --> 01:10:57,572
I do not want to be presumptuous, but...

1037
01:10:58,258 --> 01:11:00,068
can ever again?

1038
01:11:00,269 --> 01:11:01,139
Absolutely.

1039
01:11:01,895 --> 01:11:02,945
You said "we"?

1040
01:11:03,169 --> 01:11:03,859
Yes, we.

1041
01:11:09,449 --> 01:11:11,839
Accept advice from an old...

1042
01:11:12,032 --> 01:11:14,062
You is not... so old!

1043
01:11:14,263 --> 01:11:15,543
So old?!?

1044
01:11:15,663 --> 01:11:16,833
You understand me.

1045
01:11:18,669 --> 01:11:20,059
My advice is...

1046
01:11:20,726 --> 01:11:22,246
enjoy these days.

1047
01:11:24,383 --> 01:11:26,543
You only have one opportunity...

1048
01:11:27,005 --> 01:11:29,105
in the beginning of a relationship.

1049
01:11:31,344 --> 01:11:32,284
Enjoy it!

1050
01:11:34,474 --> 01:11:35,464
We will do so.

1051
01:11:36,681 --> 01:11:37,961
Anything else?

1052
01:11:41,032 --> 01:11:42,082
Be honest.

1053
01:11:43,612 --> 01:11:44,652
Even if it hurts.

1054
01:11:47,827 --> 01:11:51,258
And when you find the right kind, will not let you escape.

1055
01:11:51,258 --> 01:11:52,178
Amen to that!

1056
01:11:57,193 --> 01:11:59,524
Any advice for us single people?

1057
01:11:59,524 --> 01:12:02,537
Depends if they want to remain single or not.

1058
01:12:02,537 --> 01:12:03,517
I'm fine.

1059
01:12:03,985 --> 01:12:05,785
I like to play open.

1060
01:12:06,984 --> 01:12:08,828
There is nothing wrong with that.

1061
01:12:08,828 --> 01:12:12,158
I personally do not feel the call to a relationship.

1062
01:12:12,716 --> 01:12:16,406
It seems that monogamy only leads to boredom.

1063
01:12:17,305 --> 01:12:22,265
There because you are in a relationship does not mean you have to be monogamous.

1064
01:12:22,794 --> 01:12:23,134
Yes

1065
01:12:24,925 --> 01:12:27,255
Love and sex are separate things.

1066
01:12:28,586 --> 01:12:29,566
Not for me!

1067
01:12:30,727 --> 01:12:33,287
I mean... have had sex without love.

1068
01:12:34,380 --> 01:12:35,480
But with love...

1069
01:12:36,948 --> 01:12:38,348
is much better.

1070
01:12:40,835 --> 01:12:41,475
Weird!

1071
01:12:43,495 --> 01:12:44,955
You said weird?

1072
01:12:46,010 --> 01:12:46,650
Fascism.

1073
01:12:51,870 --> 01:12:52,970
Do not do it.

1074
01:12:54,156 --> 01:12:54,846
Okay.

1075
01:12:57,618 --> 01:13:00,538
Are you saying that since you been in love?

1076
01:13:02,021 --> 01:13:02,481
Bright!

1077
01:13:06,559 --> 01:13:07,499
Surprises me!

1078
01:13:13,135 --> 01:13:15,745
What I do is my job.

1079
01:13:17,909 --> 01:13:21,099
It has nothing to do with my private life.

1080
01:13:21,511 --> 01:13:23,091
Are you in love now?

1081
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:25,910
Definitely not!

1082
01:13:27,537 --> 01:13:28,757
But since you been?

1083
01:13:32,505 --> 01:13:34,065
And not long ago.

1084
01:13:37,906 --> 01:13:41,326
And he did not care what you do in life?

1085
01:13:45,784 --> 01:13:47,354
No! Did not care.

1086
01:13:50,574 --> 01:13:51,734
But you breaks?

1087
01:13:56,531 --> 01:13:56,871
Yes

1088
01:13:59,029 --> 01:14:01,309
For many reasons, least that.

1089
01:14:04,169 --> 01:14:06,629
Definitely not because of this.

1090
01:14:18,437 --> 01:14:21,177
I do not think Simon is gone.

1091
01:14:22,676 --> 01:14:23,776
They look good.

1092
01:14:26,937 --> 01:14:28,447
But if they end up...

1093
01:14:33,073 --> 01:14:34,523
Everything will be fine.

1094
01:14:37,244 --> 01:14:37,884
Promise?

1095
01:14:46,433 --> 01:14:47,013
I promise!

1096
01:14:54,082 --> 01:14:55,762
What are you doing here?

1097
01:14:56,482 --> 01:14:57,932
I was waiting for you.

1098
01:15:00,074 --> 01:15:00,704
Seriously

1099
01:15:02,978 --> 01:15:04,268
Looking for company?

1100
01:15:07,868 --> 01:15:08,968
Not tonight.

1101
01:15:21,183 --> 01:15:23,983
But I could use someone to talk to.

1102
01:15:25,027 --> 01:15:25,487
Really?

1103
01:15:27,683 --> 01:15:31,003
I was never friends with talk of anyone before.

1104
01:15:32,599 --> 01:15:33,699
Are you up to?

1105
01:15:34,977 --> 01:15:35,437
I!

1106
01:16:21,876 --> 01:16:24,533
If you were speaking seriously, call me this week.

1107
01:16:24,533 --> 01:16:26,583
I can give you some advice.

1108
01:16:27,721 --> 01:16:30,028
Are you sure you want to get into this line of work?

1109
01:16:30,028 --> 01:16:30,488
I!

1110
01:16:31,818 --> 01:16:32,448
I think.

1111
01:16:34,195 --> 01:16:34,775
We'll see.

1112
01:16:49,945 --> 01:16:50,525
So...

1113
01:16:50,911 --> 01:16:52,191
we see us soon?

1114
01:17:01,136 --> 01:17:02,486
We accompany you.

1115
01:17:03,323 --> 01:17:06,559
I told you that this would be an end-of-wonderful weeks.

1116
01:17:06,559 --> 01:17:07,779
There you said it.

1117
01:17:08,359 --> 01:17:09,719
But you know what?

1118
01:17:09,719 --> 01:17:11,929
We have to make the path.

1119
01:17:11,964 --> 01:17:14,377
We have dinner with my parents tonight.

1120
01:17:14,377 --> 01:17:14,837
Let?

1121
01:17:15,674 --> 01:17:16,014
Yes!

1122
01:17:17,155 --> 01:17:18,595
- Come on!
- Namaste!

1123
01:17:21,938 --> 01:17:23,278
Get a room!

1124
01:17:26,848 --> 01:17:28,308
See you at work.

1125
01:17:33,528 --> 01:17:35,618
The crazy yoga was right.

1126
01:17:35,920 --> 01:17:37,380
This was wonderful!

1127
01:17:38,473 --> 01:17:41,513
Except... the subject of the departure of Simon!

1128
01:17:42,158 --> 01:17:43,788
Well! Except for that.

1129
01:17:47,672 --> 01:17:50,880
I'm really glad I came to this weekend.

1130
01:17:50,880 --> 01:17:51,630
Me too.

1131
01:17:52,388 --> 01:17:54,761
Not have been the same without you kid.

1132
01:17:54,761 --> 01:17:56,501
Stop calling me kid!

1133
01:17:57,045 --> 01:17:58,605
Stop being a kid.

1134
01:17:59,460 --> 01:18:01,080
No, do not stop to be.

1135
01:18:01,619 --> 01:18:02,659
What they want.

1136
01:18:04,416 --> 01:18:06,129
You want to hit him or hit him I?

1137
01:18:06,129 --> 01:18:06,999
I beat him.

1138
01:18:07,668 --> 01:18:08,478
Later!

1139
01:18:47,607 --> 01:18:49,747
Not going to be the same.

1140
01:18:50,270 --> 01:18:51,200
You're wrong!

1141
01:18:52,734 --> 01:18:54,764
This will always be the same.

1142
01:18:55,484 --> 01:18:57,514
It will always be here for you.

1143
01:18:58,453 --> 01:19:03,113
Until a drought causes a
fire that destroys the entire mountain.

1144
01:19:04,074 --> 01:19:06,995
I'm trying to take a moment...
collaborates with me!

1145
01:19:06,995 --> 01:19:07,685
Okay.

1146
01:19:07,909 --> 01:19:10,279
- Has your time.
- Thank you.

1147
01:19:10,874 --> 01:19:13,144
This will always be here for you.

1148
01:19:13,181 --> 01:19:16,451
You can change the relationships may change, but...

1149
01:19:17,547 --> 01:19:21,917
Here you can ever forget
your problems and your own living.

1150
01:19:22,629 --> 01:19:24,019
And if you want me...

1151
01:19:24,871 --> 01:19:26,851
'll be here for you too.

1152
01:19:26,894 --> 01:19:28,404
That will never change.

1153
01:19:29,945 --> 01:19:33,085
I need you with the departure of Simon.

1154
01:19:33,274 --> 01:19:35,784
Do not talk like that, you'll solve everything.

1155
01:19:39,810 --> 01:19:40,150
No.

1156
01:19:42,324 --> 01:19:43,014
No more.

1157
01:19:49,413 --> 01:19:51,553
Not going to be the same.

1158
01:19:53,332 --> 01:19:53,672
No.

1159
01:19:57,397 --> 01:19:58,847
But it may be better!

1160
01:20:09,363 --> 01:20:09,823
Come!

1161
01:20:12,845 --> 01:20:13,715
It's annoying!

1162
01:20:14,417 --> 01:20:15,447
And it's all mine!

1163
01:20:18,101 --> 01:20:19,031
Are you ready?

1164
01:20:29,712 --> 01:20:30,052
Yes

1165
01:20:32,866 --> 01:20:33,796
I'm ready.
