[honking continues]

13
00:03:04,118 --> 00:03:05,552
[officer] Sir.

14
00:03:06,320 --> 00:03:07,855
Sir, can you hear me?

15
00:03:11,225 --> 00:03:14,929
Control, 2-Adam-3,
we're gonna need medical

16
00:03:15,062 --> 00:03:17,965
for a male who's been
shot to the left shoulder.

[heart rate monitor beeping]

18
00:03:44,557 --> 00:03:47,228
Mmm. Mmm.

19
00:03:47,361 --> 00:03:49,163
You sure about that?

20
00:03:49,296 --> 00:03:50,663
Your move.

21
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:54,201
[sighs]

22
00:04:00,374 --> 00:04:02,009
What?

23
00:04:02,143 --> 00:04:03,710
King. All right.

24
00:04:03,844 --> 00:04:05,612
That's two out of three.

25
00:04:06,881 --> 00:04:09,749
Okay, you are a winner.

26
00:04:11,285 --> 00:04:12,887
Then why am I here?

27
00:04:17,425 --> 00:04:20,261
Dad, I want to go home.

28
00:04:23,998 --> 00:04:26,000
I know. I know. I'm sorry.

29
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:29,236
Look, everything's
going to be okay.

30
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,905
It's not gonna be okay.

31
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:35,976
Listen, right now this is...

32
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:37,812
This is where you
have to be, okay?

33
00:04:37,945 --> 00:04:40,147
You have to be here
until you get better.

34
00:04:40,848 --> 00:04:43,716
Dad, it's not gonna work.

35
00:04:44,351 --> 00:04:45,419
Don't you get it?

36
00:04:45,553 --> 00:04:46,854
I am working on it.

37
00:04:46,987 --> 00:04:49,622
You can't stop things
from happening.

38
00:04:50,091 --> 00:04:51,092
Stop.

39
00:04:51,724 --> 00:04:53,461
You can't save me.

40
00:04:53,894 --> 00:04:55,362
I don't need you.

41
00:04:55,496 --> 00:04:58,065
You weren't there for
Mom when she needed you.

42
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:01,402
Stop it, okay? Stop, please.

43
00:05:01,535 --> 00:05:03,070
What exactly do
you want me to say?

44
00:05:03,204 --> 00:05:05,473
That it's my fault
that she's gone?

45
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,174
Fine.

46
00:05:07,308 --> 00:05:09,910
But I am not gonna
lose my daughter.

47
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,346
It's just not gonna happen.

48
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:16,317
Dad, just leave.

49
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:18,886
No. No, I'm not giving up.

50
00:05:19,487 --> 00:05:20,988
You can't help.

51
00:05:21,122 --> 00:05:23,190
There are other
treatments, Emma.

52
00:05:25,559 --> 00:05:27,394
Please leave.

53
00:05:28,295 --> 00:05:29,897
I wanna be alone.

54
00:05:31,764 --> 00:05:33,334
[sniffles]

55
00:05:36,070 --> 00:05:41,008
Emma, please do
not give up on me.

56
00:05:41,708 --> 00:05:42,977
Hmm?

57
00:05:43,110 --> 00:05:45,579
[sniffles] I'm just tired.

58
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:46,947
Go.

59
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:55,823
[sighs]

60
00:06:12,373 --> 00:06:13,373
Excuse me.

61
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:14,741
Excuse me. Mr. Gibson?

62
00:06:14,875 --> 00:06:16,177
Mr. Gibson.

63
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:21,215
[sighs] Yeah.

64
00:06:24,784 --> 00:06:27,021
I will have your
money, I promise.

65
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:29,756
If it were up to me, she could
stay as long as she wants.

66
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,724
I appreciate it.

67
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:41,902
[police siren
wailing in distance]

68
00:07:10,831 --> 00:07:14,868
It's there. I saw a couple of
Valenti's guys in there this morning.

69
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,170
You sure?

70
00:07:17,238 --> 00:07:19,673
Yeah, a guy named
Cameron, their lawyer.

71
00:07:19,807 --> 00:07:21,242
They insured it
for a lot of money.

72
00:07:21,375 --> 00:07:23,811
I was the one who
arranged the insurance.

73
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:27,214
Okay, so this is legit.

74
00:07:28,182 --> 00:07:30,618
The seed phrase is in there
with the thumb drives.

75
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,186
You better hurry though.

76
00:07:33,020 --> 00:07:34,255
And why is that?

77
00:07:35,956 --> 00:07:38,525
Armored car is gonna
pick it up in a few days.

78
00:07:41,528 --> 00:07:43,230
What about our buyer?

79
00:07:43,731 --> 00:07:45,032
All set.

80
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:49,670
[sniffs]

81
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:51,238
Ooh! Eh?

82
00:07:51,372 --> 00:07:52,406
No, I'm good.

83
00:07:52,539 --> 00:07:54,308
Suit yourself.

84
00:07:55,409 --> 00:07:57,845
[sniffs, sighs]

85
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:04,118
So this guy, uh,
you're sure about him?

86
00:08:04,251 --> 00:08:06,491
Yeah, you can come in and meet
him right now, if you want.

87
00:08:06,587 --> 00:08:09,056
Been playing poker with him
once a week. He's a whale.

88
00:08:09,189 --> 00:08:11,425
[Nick] No, no, no.
It's better if I don't.

89
00:08:15,562 --> 00:08:19,533
He's not too happy with me now
anyways. I owe him a ton of money.

90
00:08:20,734 --> 00:08:21,734
Wait, no tip?

91
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,904
You'll get it soon enough.

92
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,080
[sighs]

93
00:08:33,714 --> 00:08:34,948
Okay.

94
00:08:47,161 --> 00:08:48,262
Hey.

95
00:08:54,868 --> 00:08:57,638
These guys really stuck it to
me. Can't believe I fell for it.

96
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,139
We're all set.

97
00:08:59,273 --> 00:09:01,608
[sighs] It was supposed
to be for collateral.

98
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,680
These guys are still
holding on to my property.

99
00:09:06,815 --> 00:09:09,049
Pricks. They want
me to keep paying.

100
00:09:14,955 --> 00:09:16,290
<i>Merde.</i>

101
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:02,403
[upbeat electronic music
playing on speakers]

102
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,185
Hey, Nick.

103
00:10:20,754 --> 00:10:22,556
So you own this place?

104
00:10:23,056 --> 00:10:24,458
More or less.

105
00:10:26,895 --> 00:10:30,832
You can sign up for an
annual contract, or monthly.

106
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:32,533
It's cheaper to do the annual.

107
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,102
But that means you have
to make a commitment.

108
00:10:36,103 --> 00:10:39,673
Ah, funny. Funny. But
that was a long time ago.

109
00:10:45,179 --> 00:10:47,414
Still got that
sense of humor, huh?

110
00:11:02,529 --> 00:11:03,597
So...

111
00:11:05,699 --> 00:11:08,435
do you think Jack would
be interested in this?

112
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:11,972
I mean, it's 500 grand for Jack.

113
00:11:12,706 --> 00:11:13,808
And plus,

114
00:11:13,942 --> 00:11:15,910
more for your guys...
His guys, I guess.

115
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:17,678
And for you.

116
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:21,315
I actually can't do
this without a crew.

117
00:11:21,448 --> 00:11:23,617
It's good to see you too.

118
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:27,856
You doing this for Emma?

119
00:11:27,988 --> 00:11:29,223
[sighs] Yeah.

120
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:31,960
There's an experimental
procedure in LA,

121
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:35,128
but insurance won't
cover it, so...

122
00:11:36,763 --> 00:11:38,365
I'm sorry.

123
00:11:39,299 --> 00:11:40,835
I'll see what I can do.

124
00:11:41,301 --> 00:11:43,036
I'll talk to him.

125
00:11:49,643 --> 00:11:51,011
All right.

126
00:11:52,613 --> 00:11:53,680
Uh...

127
00:11:55,249 --> 00:11:57,050
Funny, huh?

128
00:11:58,452 --> 00:12:00,220
[chuckles]

129
00:12:03,156 --> 00:12:04,658
Where did you find this?

130
00:12:05,827 --> 00:12:07,728
Figured you'd want it back.

131
00:12:12,099 --> 00:12:13,467
Keep it.

132
00:12:15,602 --> 00:12:17,237
Thank you.

133
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:21,508
[door closes]

134
00:13:07,788 --> 00:13:11,658
Business is slow, but I'm making
my payments. You'll get your money.

135
00:13:23,303 --> 00:13:26,773
It's a hundred K. It'll
take ten years at this rate.

136
00:13:30,078 --> 00:13:32,746
There is a way I could
get you a bigger payment.

137
00:13:34,015 --> 00:13:35,850
I have a connection to a job,

138
00:13:36,683 --> 00:13:39,419
but only if it means
I'm out of our deal.

139
00:13:40,955 --> 00:13:42,189
Okay?

140
00:13:42,623 --> 00:13:43,757
Paid in full.

141
00:14:20,794 --> 00:14:22,796
[phone ringing]

142
00:14:27,035 --> 00:14:28,402
Hey, Jim.

143
00:14:28,535 --> 00:14:30,604
Yeah, no, I got your messages.

144
00:14:34,108 --> 00:14:36,044
Really? Um...

145
00:14:36,176 --> 00:14:37,611
That can't be right. I'm...

146
00:14:37,744 --> 00:14:40,081
I'm pretty sure I already
sent the check in.

147
00:14:40,213 --> 00:14:42,549
Okay. Okay, fine.

148
00:14:42,683 --> 00:14:46,154
Fine. Yeah, no, I will,
uh... I'll look into it.

149
00:14:46,988 --> 00:14:49,556
And I'll get back to
you as soon as I can.

150
00:14:50,691 --> 00:14:51,725
Okay.

151
00:14:52,894 --> 00:14:53,928
Fuck.

152
00:14:58,900 --> 00:15:02,837
We can't move in until
the bank manager leaves.

153
00:15:02,970 --> 00:15:06,606
Fortunately for us,
every weekday at 2:30,

154
00:15:06,740 --> 00:15:09,676
she leaves to pick up her
kid from school, okay?

155
00:15:09,811 --> 00:15:11,813
So that'll be our
window right here.

156
00:15:11,946 --> 00:15:13,213
2:30.

157
00:15:13,747 --> 00:15:15,016
Twenty minutes.

158
00:15:15,149 --> 00:15:18,618
Once Jack gets everyone
inside, you'll need my contact.

159
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:20,822
This is Ryan.

160
00:15:20,955 --> 00:15:23,390
He's the assistant
branch manager.

161
00:15:24,424 --> 00:15:26,928
He'll have the keys to
the boxes and the vault.

162
00:15:27,627 --> 00:15:28,996
Now,

163
00:15:29,130 --> 00:15:31,665
you can push him
around a little,

164
00:15:31,798 --> 00:15:33,433
but only a little.

165
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:36,403
Okay, it's just for show.

166
00:15:36,536 --> 00:15:38,338
Why would we do that
if he's your contact?

167
00:15:38,472 --> 00:15:42,676
[sighs] Because the idea here is to
make this look like a messy amateur job.

168
00:15:45,046 --> 00:15:46,379
Thank you.

169
00:15:46,948 --> 00:15:48,515
Now,

170
00:15:48,648 --> 00:15:51,219
once you have his keys,
you can get the boxes open

171
00:15:51,351 --> 00:15:54,454
despite not having the
customers' keys as well, correct?

172
00:15:54,588 --> 00:15:57,390
I can get the boxes open.
I don't need the keys.

173
00:15:57,524 --> 00:16:00,260
It won't be pretty, but
I can get them open.

174
00:16:00,962 --> 00:16:02,196
That's good. That's good.

175
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:04,598
The uglier, the
better. All right?

176
00:16:04,731 --> 00:16:07,201
You wanna focus on the
larger boxes, all right,

177
00:16:07,334 --> 00:16:09,503
on the left side
of the wall, here.

178
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:11,973
Box 23.

179
00:16:13,908 --> 00:16:15,509
That is our box.

180
00:16:15,642 --> 00:16:19,412
And inside, you will
find this briefcase.

181
00:16:20,447 --> 00:16:22,884
Feel free to hit as
many boxes as you can,

182
00:16:23,017 --> 00:16:25,853
but Jack will handle box 23.

183
00:16:26,954 --> 00:16:29,056
Whatever's in the
other boxes and...

184
00:16:29,190 --> 00:16:33,360
And whatever cash is in the
vault, that's all yours.

185
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,428
So what's in that case?

186
00:16:38,232 --> 00:16:40,134
None of your fucking business.

187
00:16:40,268 --> 00:16:43,703
There'll be plenty of cash in the
vault and the other boxes. Got it?

188
00:16:47,741 --> 00:16:49,844
Who's this mousy little freak?

189
00:16:49,977 --> 00:16:51,813
[Nick] Shit. Right.

190
00:16:51,946 --> 00:16:53,047
This is Xander.

191
00:16:53,181 --> 00:16:54,481
He'll be remote.

192
00:16:54,614 --> 00:16:57,985
He's gonna monitor
cameras, intercept alarms,

193
00:16:58,119 --> 00:16:59,619
listen for cops.

194
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:02,556
No one gets hurt.

195
00:17:02,689 --> 00:17:06,928
Are you running this
job, Jack? Or is he?

196
00:17:07,761 --> 00:17:08,896
[grunts]

197
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:12,300
You listen to me.
I'm running this job.

198
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:15,169
It's the last time I'm gonna tell
you, 'cause I don't have time

199
00:17:15,303 --> 00:17:16,971
to trade your ass out.

200
00:17:17,671 --> 00:17:20,774
I'm running you.
You understand?

201
00:17:26,379 --> 00:17:27,614
[sighs]

202
00:17:28,950 --> 00:17:31,252
People will be
looking for that case.

203
00:17:31,384 --> 00:17:33,587
And for you, okay?

204
00:17:33,720 --> 00:17:35,655
We start really hurting people,

205
00:17:35,789 --> 00:17:38,658
the cops are gonna take
a keen interest as well.

206
00:17:38,792 --> 00:17:40,694
It's just heat we don't need.

207
00:17:40,828 --> 00:17:42,729
[Jerry] That's one
way to look at it.

208
00:17:42,864 --> 00:17:45,432
Sometimes things
happen in there.

209
00:17:46,968 --> 00:17:48,368
Not this time.

210
00:17:49,536 --> 00:17:51,471
We do the job, we leave.

211
00:17:51,605 --> 00:17:56,710
Feds lose interest and think that some
amateur made a mess and got lucky.

212
00:17:56,844 --> 00:18:00,680
Okay, they might be
looking, just not for us.

213
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:04,018
Listen, fellas,
we do this right,

214
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:07,822
there's a fat payday and
everyone gets their share.

215
00:18:09,656 --> 00:18:11,758
Okay. We cool?

216
00:18:13,261 --> 00:18:14,728
All right.

217
00:18:18,900 --> 00:18:19,934
[door opens]

218
00:18:27,474 --> 00:18:28,775
That's crap.

219
00:18:29,509 --> 00:18:31,112
How much you think
Jack's getting?

220
00:18:31,245 --> 00:18:33,589
I never done a job where we
didn't know how much the take is.

221
00:18:33,613 --> 00:18:36,416
This shit don't feel right.

222
00:18:49,196 --> 00:18:50,932
[Veronica sighs]

223
00:18:52,766 --> 00:18:55,937
No, don't worry
about him. All right?

224
00:18:57,371 --> 00:18:58,738
His dad looked
after me in prison,

225
00:18:58,873 --> 00:19:02,442
and so I promised him that
I would look after his son

226
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,145
when I got out.

227
00:19:04,278 --> 00:19:05,512
That's it.

228
00:19:06,314 --> 00:19:09,116
Plus, he's got skills.

229
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:10,717
[typing on keyboard]

230
00:19:10,851 --> 00:19:13,421
Did you get the buyer
info I sent you? Yeah.

231
00:19:13,586 --> 00:19:14,754
Okay.

232
00:19:15,588 --> 00:19:17,224
Five days is a long
time to lay low

233
00:19:17,358 --> 00:19:19,126
before we make the sale.

234
00:19:21,028 --> 00:19:22,930
The exchange is
person-to-person.

235
00:19:23,064 --> 00:19:25,104
I already confirmed the date
and time with the buyer.

236
00:19:25,166 --> 00:19:27,835
Changing it now, that
would just... Nah.

237
00:19:28,970 --> 00:19:30,104
Leave it.

238
00:19:30,972 --> 00:19:32,572
But I'm gonna need
some insurance

239
00:19:32,706 --> 00:19:35,542
so things fly straight
after the bank.

240
00:19:37,644 --> 00:19:38,879
No problem.

241
00:19:44,617 --> 00:19:47,188
[typing on keyboard]

242
00:19:54,028 --> 00:19:55,595
Standing by.

243
00:19:56,663 --> 00:19:57,898
[Nick] <i>Copy that.</i>

244
00:20:02,403 --> 00:20:03,838
2:30.

245
00:20:10,744 --> 00:20:13,247
[Nick] Bingo, there she is.

246
00:20:14,382 --> 00:20:15,816
Right on time.

247
00:20:17,084 --> 00:20:18,119
Xander,

248
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:20,620
start the feed.

249
00:20:22,056 --> 00:20:23,124
Copy that.

250
00:20:23,891 --> 00:20:28,795
New feed starting
in three, two, one.

251
00:20:28,929 --> 00:20:31,899
[Nick] <i>Yeah, copy that.</i> Feed
is live, clock is running.

252
00:20:32,632 --> 00:20:34,168
[Nick] All right, let's dance.

253
00:20:34,802 --> 00:20:36,170
Stick to the plan.

254
00:20:41,942 --> 00:20:43,543
Everybody on the floor now!

255
00:20:43,676 --> 00:20:45,346
Oh, God! Get back!

256
00:20:45,479 --> 00:20:48,182
[screaming] Heads
down, right now!

257
00:20:48,315 --> 00:20:51,085
[Sullivan] Shut your mouth.
[Jerry] Get down, get down!

258
00:20:51,218 --> 00:20:53,888
Open the door. [Sullivan]
Keep your head down!

259
00:20:54,021 --> 00:20:56,023
[Jack] Open the fucking
door! [Ryan] Open the door.

260
00:20:56,157 --> 00:20:58,359
[Sullivan] You wanna die?
Head down, right now!

261
00:20:58,492 --> 00:21:01,429
[Sullivan] Shut your mouth.
What are you looking at? Huh?

262
00:21:01,561 --> 00:21:02,796
[Willis] Get the fuck back!

263
00:21:08,069 --> 00:21:09,170
[chuckles]

264
00:21:11,072 --> 00:21:13,174
Hurry. Open the door. Come on.

265
00:21:13,307 --> 00:21:14,975
[Willis] Stay the fuck down!

266
00:21:15,843 --> 00:21:17,812
[Sullivan] Don't be a hero.

267
00:21:20,548 --> 00:21:22,450
[whimpering, crying]

268
00:21:22,582 --> 00:21:23,918
Shut up.

269
00:21:24,051 --> 00:21:25,685
You do not look at me, okay?

270
00:21:25,820 --> 00:21:27,687
Don't fucking look at me!

271
00:21:28,956 --> 00:21:30,657
Where's the key to the boxes?

272
00:21:30,790 --> 00:21:32,259
They won't work.

273
00:21:33,660 --> 00:21:34,995
I'm not asking ya.

274
00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:37,098
Give me the keys. Good boy.

275
00:21:37,231 --> 00:21:40,267
[whimpering, crying]

276
00:21:40,401 --> 00:21:41,836
Stay down!

277
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:07,660
[Jack] Back in the lobby
with the rest of them. Go.

278
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:09,729
Manager's coming out!

279
00:22:10,297 --> 00:22:11,499
Get over here.

280
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:13,267
Get down! Stay right there!

281
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:15,302
I hear anything out of
you, I won't think twice

282
00:22:15,436 --> 00:22:17,805
about putting a bullet
through your skull!

283
00:22:31,051 --> 00:22:32,086
Box 23.

284
00:22:37,191 --> 00:22:40,094
[locks breaking]

285
00:22:43,297 --> 00:22:44,298
Let's move.

286
00:22:48,169 --> 00:22:50,104
Don't you fucking look at me!

287
00:23:01,081 --> 00:23:03,817
[police sirens
wailing in distance]

288
00:23:08,923 --> 00:23:11,559
Don't fucking look
at me! [whimpering]

289
00:23:11,691 --> 00:23:15,129
[lock breaking continues]

290
00:23:15,262 --> 00:23:16,931
[crying]

291
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:18,999
Stay down! Stay down!

292
00:23:19,133 --> 00:23:20,834
Four minutes. Let's go.

293
00:23:29,043 --> 00:23:30,743
[person crying] No.

294
00:23:31,679 --> 00:23:32,913
Let's go.

295
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,422
Faces down!

296
00:23:46,793 --> 00:23:49,163
I said stay down! Head down!

297
00:23:49,697 --> 00:23:50,763
Come on! Hey.

298
00:23:50,898 --> 00:23:52,566
What are you doing?
[person] No! No.

299
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:53,766
Hey.

300
00:23:53,901 --> 00:23:55,336
Stop! Come on.

301
00:24:00,941 --> 00:24:02,309
[Nick] Where the hell is he?

302
00:24:07,681 --> 00:24:09,216
Hey, what the hell, man?

303
00:24:09,883 --> 00:24:11,385
Hey, we're all set.

304
00:24:12,519 --> 00:24:13,654
Yo, hey, what is this?

305
00:24:13,821 --> 00:24:15,422
[person screams]

306
00:24:27,635 --> 00:24:30,504
[Nick] What the hell were
you doing in there? Huh?

307
00:24:30,638 --> 00:24:32,473
[tires screech]

308
00:24:34,141 --> 00:24:36,877
Show me your hands!
Show me your hands!

309
00:24:37,011 --> 00:24:38,746
Hands up! Hands up!

310
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:39,980
All clear.

311
00:24:40,114 --> 00:24:42,349
HQ, we've got the
wrong location.

312
00:24:44,318 --> 00:24:46,720
[laughing] Whoo!

313
00:24:46,887 --> 00:24:48,989
That's why they
call me the Xan Man.

314
00:24:49,123 --> 00:24:50,991
[singsongy] That's
the B-I-G X-A-N.

315
00:24:51,125 --> 00:24:53,560
[singing continues]

316
00:24:53,694 --> 00:24:55,829
[all cheering, screaming]

317
00:24:55,963 --> 00:24:57,264
Yes! Yeah!

318
00:24:57,398 --> 00:25:01,302
We did it, guys!
Yeah! Fuck yeah!

319
00:25:01,435 --> 00:25:02,603
Goddamn!

320
00:25:02,736 --> 00:25:04,447
[Nick] Nobody following
us. We're free and clear.

321
00:25:04,471 --> 00:25:06,573
Oh, my God. You
gotta see this thing.

322
00:25:06,707 --> 00:25:08,375
[Veronica] Whoo! Hell yeah.

323
00:25:11,445 --> 00:25:12,813
Hell yeah.

324
00:25:22,856 --> 00:25:25,192
Hey, look at
that. You like it?

325
00:25:26,727 --> 00:25:28,262
See what you can do.

326
00:25:35,669 --> 00:25:37,271
I could've done that.

327
00:25:43,210 --> 00:25:47,114
Hey, hey, hey. You
guys knew the deal.

328
00:25:47,247 --> 00:25:49,750
You guys keep the cash and
whatever else you can find,

329
00:25:49,883 --> 00:25:51,919
but not this.

330
00:25:59,560 --> 00:26:01,962
There's 500 grand on that thing.

331
00:26:02,096 --> 00:26:03,464
Don't lose it.

332
00:26:08,502 --> 00:26:10,137
[exhales]

333
00:26:10,270 --> 00:26:12,139
[Jack] All right, well,
stick with the plan.

334
00:26:12,272 --> 00:26:15,309
Can't have you guys out
running around like idiots.

335
00:26:15,442 --> 00:26:20,347
Wait a few days, and we
all get our cut. All right?

336
00:26:21,515 --> 00:26:22,750
We cool?

337
00:26:22,883 --> 00:26:24,284
Here's a little taste.

338
00:26:27,187 --> 00:26:29,323
[chuckling, chattering]

339
00:26:30,724 --> 00:26:32,092
Yes.

340
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:11,632
[car door opens, closes]

341
00:27:34,488 --> 00:27:36,323
[engine starts]

342
00:27:40,227 --> 00:27:41,462
[car alarm chirps]

343
00:27:54,174 --> 00:27:55,509
What the...

344
00:28:03,283 --> 00:28:06,153
[grunting, gasping]

345
00:28:08,422 --> 00:28:09,623
[gunshots]

346
00:28:09,756 --> 00:28:11,658
[groans]

347
00:28:22,102 --> 00:28:24,104
[horn honking] Let's go!

348
00:28:28,509 --> 00:28:31,178
[horn honking] Fuck him.
Come on, guys. We gotta go!

349
00:28:31,311 --> 00:28:33,146
[engine starts]

350
00:29:10,217 --> 00:29:13,120
[grunts]

351
00:29:15,689 --> 00:29:16,790

[horn honking]

353
00:29:46,186 --> 00:29:47,554
Sir, can you hear me?

354
00:29:51,826 --> 00:29:55,362
[sighs] You know, there was
cops already here, okay?

355
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:58,866
I told them everything
that I knew.

356
00:30:00,334 --> 00:30:02,736
Mr. Thompson?

357
00:30:02,870 --> 00:30:06,139
Look, like I said, right?

358
00:30:06,273 --> 00:30:07,774
Well, I had...

359
00:30:08,609 --> 00:30:11,645
I checked my tire, had a flat,

360
00:30:11,778 --> 00:30:14,281
and then someone tapped
me on the shoulder.

361
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:18,285
That's it. That's
all I remember.

362
00:30:19,553 --> 00:30:20,721
All right.

363
00:30:20,855 --> 00:30:24,591
Well, feel free to call us
if any details come to mind.

364
00:30:25,059 --> 00:30:26,293
Yep.

365
00:30:27,661 --> 00:30:28,863
[exhales]

366
00:30:30,631 --> 00:30:31,665
Okay.

367
00:30:37,805 --> 00:30:39,373
[door closes]

368
00:30:44,611 --> 00:30:45,913
[groans]

369
00:30:49,851 --> 00:30:51,019
[beeping]

370
00:30:51,151 --> 00:30:52,686
He's hiding something.

371
00:30:52,820 --> 00:30:55,455
Yeah, most ride-share drivers
are scammers anyway, you know?

372
00:30:55,589 --> 00:30:59,292
Working with fake IDs, primarily for the
strip clubs, bringing them customers.

373
00:30:59,426 --> 00:31:01,795
Maybe he just doesn't
want us to know about it.

374
00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:03,630
[phone buzzes] Hold on.

375
00:31:04,966 --> 00:31:06,934
Hey, Reed. It's Cooper.

376
00:31:08,502 --> 00:31:10,237
Yeah, do me a favor.

377
00:31:10,370 --> 00:31:12,305
[door opens]

378
00:31:15,109 --> 00:31:16,109
Hey. Hey.

379
00:31:16,176 --> 00:31:17,444
Is everything okay? Yeah.

380
00:31:17,577 --> 00:31:19,147
I need to use the bathroom.

381
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,580
All right, here.

382
00:31:21,214 --> 00:31:22,950
Hang on to this. Okay.

383
00:31:27,421 --> 00:31:29,756
Yeah. All right, let's go.

384
00:31:29,891 --> 00:31:32,793
Actually, I think I
can manage from here.

385
00:31:32,927 --> 00:31:34,128
You got it? Yeah.

386
00:31:34,261 --> 00:31:36,730
I might be a minute, if
you know what I mean.

387
00:31:59,020 --> 00:32:00,253
[sniffs]

388
00:32:04,992 --> 00:32:07,594
[phone ringing]

389
00:32:14,668 --> 00:32:17,304
That shit's gonna
make you stupid.

390
00:32:19,107 --> 00:32:21,308
[ringing continues]

391
00:32:21,441 --> 00:32:23,376
I told you not to call.

392
00:32:26,246 --> 00:32:29,783
Every time we talk to each
other, it's a risk we don't need.

393
00:32:30,517 --> 00:32:31,953
I haven't heard about Nick.

394
00:32:32,086 --> 00:32:35,489
Well, if they found his
body, it'd be out by now.

395
00:32:38,926 --> 00:32:41,963
You sure? You
don't sound sure.

396
00:32:43,697 --> 00:32:44,765
Then what?

397
00:32:46,466 --> 00:32:48,568
That wasn't part
of the agreement.

398
00:32:48,702 --> 00:32:51,671
Like I said, 50K to do Nick.

399
00:32:51,806 --> 00:32:55,275
You don't get paid till I
sell the case. That's it.

400
00:32:56,077 --> 00:32:57,912
What are you saying, Jerry?

401
00:32:58,045 --> 00:33:00,781
You're trying to hold
out? Is that a threat?

402
00:33:02,682 --> 00:33:04,819
You better think
about how you answer.

403
00:33:06,053 --> 00:33:07,053
Listen to me.

404
00:33:07,121 --> 00:33:08,622
I have the leverage, Jack.

405
00:33:08,755 --> 00:33:11,859
Either you get me the money
or I'm not showing up.

406
00:33:11,993 --> 00:33:14,162
You're gonna screw
this whole deal.

407
00:33:14,294 --> 00:33:18,099
The buyer is ready. There's
nothing I can do about that.

408
00:33:18,232 --> 00:33:19,432
Guaranteed money.

409
00:33:19,566 --> 00:33:21,735
I want Nick's share,
and that's it.

410
00:33:21,869 --> 00:33:24,604
I'm not budging.
You figure it out.

411
00:33:24,738 --> 00:33:28,976
I will text you when it's
time to get your cash.

412
00:33:33,780 --> 00:33:35,448
Hello?

413
00:33:35,883 --> 00:33:37,084
Hello?

414
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,231
Willis,

415
00:33:50,363 --> 00:33:52,967
I need you to do me a favor.

416
00:33:59,506 --> 00:34:01,341
[groans]

417
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:34,075
Thank you.

418
00:35:49,216 --> 00:35:50,650
Can I help you?

419
00:35:50,784 --> 00:35:53,020
Uh, yeah. I'm looking
for Emma Gibson's room.

420
00:35:53,154 --> 00:35:54,155
Are you a relative?

421
00:35:54,288 --> 00:35:57,024
No, a friend of the family.

422
00:35:57,158 --> 00:35:59,927
Oh, I'm sorry,
sir. No visitors.

423
00:36:00,061 --> 00:36:02,462
Only immediate family allowed.

424
00:36:02,595 --> 00:36:03,931
Can I give those to her?

425
00:36:04,065 --> 00:36:08,069
Could you? That'd be
great. Thanks so much.

426
00:36:08,202 --> 00:36:11,571
Can we give these to
her after her MRI?

427
00:36:21,015 --> 00:36:22,216
[beep]

428
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:29,689
[heart rate monitor beeping]

429
00:36:38,099 --> 00:36:41,268
[bear squeaks] [recording] <i>Hi,
Emma. Uncle Willis says hello.</i>

430
00:36:48,876 --> 00:36:49,944
Dad.

431
00:36:52,013 --> 00:36:53,047
Hey.

432
00:36:54,915 --> 00:36:56,884
I'm gonna get you
outta here soon.

433
00:36:57,018 --> 00:37:00,787
Where have you been
these days anyway?

434
00:37:00,921 --> 00:37:03,157
Don't worry. Why are
you dressed like that?

435
00:37:05,026 --> 00:37:07,995
Don't tell me. I
don't wanna know.

436
00:37:08,561 --> 00:37:10,064
Don't worry about it.

437
00:37:11,298 --> 00:37:13,134
[coughs]

438
00:37:13,267 --> 00:37:14,301
Here.

439
00:37:16,137 --> 00:37:18,738
[coughing]

440
00:37:25,413 --> 00:37:26,981
[sighs]

441
00:37:33,821 --> 00:37:35,923
I'm gonna be back, okay?

442
00:37:52,173 --> 00:37:53,640
You call for a ride?

443
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:57,445
I got you.

444
00:37:58,145 --> 00:38:00,580
Let's get the hell outta here.

445
00:38:07,620 --> 00:38:09,622
I never trusted those guys.

446
00:38:10,324 --> 00:38:11,791
Got you some clothes.

447
00:38:12,860 --> 00:38:14,962
You think Jack and
Veronica are in on it?

448
00:38:17,031 --> 00:38:19,300
Is there something we
can do in the blockchain?

449
00:38:19,433 --> 00:38:21,068
Or, I don't know, uh...

450
00:38:21,202 --> 00:38:24,038
Get the transaction
reversed or get it back?

451
00:38:24,171 --> 00:38:25,973
We can't do anything
without the drives.

452
00:38:26,107 --> 00:38:29,009
Without the seed phrase, it's
impossible to access them.

453
00:38:29,143 --> 00:38:32,313
I'm gonna get it
back. All of it.

454
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:36,884
[crackling]

455
00:38:37,017 --> 00:38:39,686
What? What's that? Got
a great deal on Amazon.

456
00:38:39,820 --> 00:38:41,889
[crackles] You're
gonna need it.

457
00:38:49,762 --> 00:38:51,132
[groans]

458
00:38:52,399 --> 00:38:53,633
Damn.

459
00:38:54,902 --> 00:38:56,137
Looks pretty bad.

460
00:38:58,771 --> 00:39:03,244
Look, I need you to go back to
the hospital. To keep an eye out.

461
00:39:04,744 --> 00:39:07,248
Okay, yeah. I'll
take care of Emma.

462
00:39:16,323 --> 00:39:19,692
Okay, here's the footage from
before the robbery, on the cloud.

463
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:22,530
The on-site hard
drives were destroyed.

464
00:39:23,197 --> 00:39:26,100
What time is this?
This is 2:29.

465
00:39:26,834 --> 00:39:28,969
Who's that? [Reed]
Bank manager.

466
00:39:30,471 --> 00:39:32,106
And the robbery starts...

467
00:39:32,239 --> 00:39:36,110
Just after 2:30,
right around here.

468
00:39:38,412 --> 00:39:39,413
Nothing.

469
00:39:40,247 --> 00:39:41,714
It's a fake feed. [Reed] Yep.

470
00:39:41,849 --> 00:39:43,217
Now, quick, go back.

471
00:39:47,054 --> 00:39:48,389
That's the cut point.

472
00:39:49,390 --> 00:39:51,892
And that's where
the robbery starts.

473
00:39:52,026 --> 00:39:55,029
And they switched the feed
as it uploaded to the cloud.

474
00:39:57,131 --> 00:39:59,766
This ain't no smash
and grab. They're pros.

475
00:39:59,900 --> 00:40:02,136
You have any other footage
from outside the business?

476
00:40:02,269 --> 00:40:03,871
Yes.

477
00:40:09,476 --> 00:40:10,743
There it is.

478
00:40:12,479 --> 00:40:13,514
Any plates?

479
00:40:13,647 --> 00:40:14,925
They knew where
the cameras were.

480
00:40:14,949 --> 00:40:16,389
Only a partial.
We're running it now.

481
00:40:16,450 --> 00:40:19,719
Okay. Call us when
something comes in.

482
00:40:19,853 --> 00:40:22,623
Let's go see what's up with
those safety deposit boxes.

483
00:40:22,789 --> 00:40:24,058
Thanks, Reed.

484
00:40:52,953 --> 00:40:56,190
No. [lighter clicks]

485
00:41:23,617 --> 00:41:25,853

490
00:41:47,875 --> 00:41:50,244
Where is it, huh?

491
00:41:50,377 --> 00:41:53,147
Hey, asshole, where
is my goddamn case?

492
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:56,216
It wasn't me.
Jack! It was Jack.

493
00:41:56,350 --> 00:41:58,452
All right, where is he? Hmm?

494
00:41:58,585 --> 00:41:59,720
Screw you.

495
00:41:59,853 --> 00:42:02,289
Where the hell is he, huh?

00:42:02,423 --> 00:42:04,858
[both grunting]

497
00:42:04,992 --> 00:42:06,493
Where is he?

498
00:42:07,027 --> 00:42:08,027
Where is he?

499
00:42:08,095 --> 00:42:11,832
[grunting, screaming]

500
00:42:12,766 --> 00:42:15,202
I don't know! I don't know!

501
00:42:15,336 --> 00:42:17,671
He said he was gonna
cut us a deal, okay?

502
00:42:17,806 --> 00:42:19,086
He said we were gonna get a cut.

503
00:42:19,139 --> 00:42:20,874
I don't know where
he is, I swear!

504
00:42:21,008 --> 00:42:24,278
[choking] All I know is he's hanging
out with that coked-up whore.

You know what?

508
00:42:34,688 --> 00:42:38,625
Never go near my daughter
again! You hear me?

509
00:42:38,759 --> 00:42:40,394
[grunts] Do you
fucking hear me?

How you doing?

521
00:43:47,995 --> 00:43:49,096
[sighs] You know.

522
00:43:49,229 --> 00:43:51,432
Oh, shit. That
doesn't look good.

523

I'm... I'm not doing that
sort of stuff anymore.

I just can't...

526
00:43:57,806 --> 00:43:59,306
I see that.

Oh, shit. Let me get
this out of your way.

I'm gonna have you
sit right there.

All right, I got,
uh... Let's see.

532
00:44:13,320 --> 00:44:15,022
Let me get this bag over here.

533
00:44:15,155 --> 00:44:16,657
I got a clean sheet.

534
00:44:17,724 --> 00:44:19,159
I think this will work.

Oh, man. Yep, it's clean.

All right, let's see.

539
00:44:31,705 --> 00:44:33,040
Okay, good.

540
00:44:36,310 --> 00:44:38,779
All right, looks like
you got two wounds.

541
00:44:38,913 --> 00:44:39,914
Right?

542
00:44:40,047 --> 00:44:41,682
Yep. All right.

543
00:44:41,816 --> 00:44:44,785
Looks like you had a
collision with some lead.

544
00:44:45,486 --> 00:44:47,521
Yeah, you could
say that. Yeah.

545
00:44:48,489 --> 00:44:50,991
I got bad news for you. The
sutures have come undone.

546
00:44:51,124 --> 00:44:53,327
You're losing a lot
of blood back here.

547
00:44:54,261 --> 00:44:55,729
Any problems with
your breathing?

548
00:44:55,864 --> 00:44:57,631
No, no. Okay.

549
00:44:58,232 --> 00:44:59,500
I'm gonna have to...

550
00:44:59,633 --> 00:45:01,068
I'm gonna have to clean this up.

551
00:45:01,201 --> 00:45:02,669
This is gonna
sting a little bit.

552
00:45:02,804 --> 00:45:04,873
But I gotta see what I'm
doing back here, all right?

553
00:45:05,005 --> 00:45:06,240
Mm-hmm.

554
00:45:07,074 --> 00:45:09,510
[groans] Fuck, yeah.

555
00:45:09,643 --> 00:45:12,412
All right, let me see if I
have a clean needle here.

556
00:45:12,546 --> 00:45:14,348
No, I'm just
kidding. [chuckles]

557
00:45:14,481 --> 00:45:16,885
Despite what the
state of Nevada says,

558
00:45:17,017 --> 00:45:19,921
I am a very capable physician.

559
00:45:20,053 --> 00:45:22,293
This is gonna help. I don't
have anything really for pain.

560
00:45:22,422 --> 00:45:25,259
I got this... I got
this numbing gel.

561
00:45:26,226 --> 00:45:29,162
Works on the gums
pretty good. [chuckles]

562
00:45:31,198 --> 00:45:34,801
You ready? This is gonna... This is gonna
hurt, 'cause this is the first poke.

563
00:45:34,936 --> 00:45:36,737
[Nick exhales] Okay.

564
00:45:36,871 --> 00:45:38,305
You all right? Yeah.

565
00:45:41,943 --> 00:45:44,378
[groans] Just about done.

566
00:45:46,480 --> 00:45:47,548
All right.

567
00:45:48,482 --> 00:45:50,217
Whew. Uh...

568
00:45:50,350 --> 00:45:55,055
You want some, uh... I might have
some pills for some pain, right here.

569
00:45:56,323 --> 00:45:57,791
Use only as directed.

570
00:45:59,027 --> 00:46:01,728
These look old and expired.

571
00:46:02,195 --> 00:46:03,297
They still work?

572
00:46:03,430 --> 00:46:05,599
Well, they work
pretty good for me.

573
00:46:06,767 --> 00:46:08,870
I just wanna finish
that beer. Mmm.

574
00:46:09,003 --> 00:46:10,237
You want one?

575
00:46:11,138 --> 00:46:13,340
Sure. Take mine.

576
00:46:19,780 --> 00:46:23,350
Hey, boss, that van that
we found, it was stolen.

577
00:46:23,483 --> 00:46:25,519
The partial license
plate matches.

578
00:46:25,652 --> 00:46:27,521
Any prints? So far nothing.

579
00:46:27,654 --> 00:46:29,156
[phone buzzes]

580
00:46:29,891 --> 00:46:31,124
Cooper.

581
00:46:33,760 --> 00:46:34,829
Uh-huh.

582
00:46:36,030 --> 00:46:37,464
Is that right?

583
00:46:37,598 --> 00:46:39,867
Okay. Yeah, you got it.

584
00:46:40,601 --> 00:46:41,435
Thanks.

585
00:46:41,568 --> 00:46:43,704
A lawyer named
Cameron just called.

586
00:46:43,838 --> 00:46:46,173
Owner of one of the
safety deposit boxes.

587
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:50,477
Filed for a missing item. It's insured for
a lot of money. This guy's making a claim.

588
00:47:21,876 --> 00:47:22,877
Can I help you?

589
00:47:23,011 --> 00:47:25,712
Yes. Mr. Gibson
for Mr. Cameron.

590
00:47:27,381 --> 00:47:30,250
I have some information
for him. Regarding?

591
00:47:30,384 --> 00:47:32,586
Something of his that
was recently stolen.

592
00:47:38,792 --> 00:47:41,428
[whispers] Yeah, we have a
guy that's waiting for him.

593
00:47:43,163 --> 00:47:44,398
Okay.

594
00:47:45,833 --> 00:47:47,167
Follow me.

595
00:48:01,748 --> 00:48:04,184
Mr. Gibson, how
can I help you?

596
00:48:06,054 --> 00:48:07,721
All right, well, um...

597
00:48:09,623 --> 00:48:12,759
kinda hoping that we can...
We can help each other.

598
00:48:13,360 --> 00:48:14,394
I, uh...

599
00:48:14,528 --> 00:48:17,431
I have information
about that item

600
00:48:17,564 --> 00:48:19,800
that was stolen from
one of your clients.

601
00:48:21,102 --> 00:48:25,372
Yeah, but it needs to be
presented directly to Mr. Valenti.

602
00:48:25,505 --> 00:48:28,142
My client list is strictly
confidential, Mr. Gibson.

603
00:48:28,275 --> 00:48:32,379
Even if I had a client with that
name, I wouldn't discuss it with you.

604
00:48:33,313 --> 00:48:34,581
Okay.

605
00:48:35,549 --> 00:48:37,451
Okay. Never mind then.

606
00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:38,719
Um...

607
00:48:39,352 --> 00:48:41,388
Appreciate your time.

608
00:48:44,524 --> 00:48:48,029
You know, I really hope
that what I have to say

609
00:48:48,162 --> 00:48:52,365
does not reach Mr. Valenti
from someone else, you know?

610
00:48:54,836 --> 00:48:57,571
All right, wait.
Close the door.

611
00:48:58,973 --> 00:49:02,342
I don't know who you think you are
or what game you're playing at,

612
00:49:02,476 --> 00:49:04,178
but be at this address.

613
00:49:04,311 --> 00:49:08,415
Call this number in one hour.
You'll receive further instructions.

614
00:49:10,818 --> 00:49:14,588
But be careful, Mr. Gibson.
Be very, very careful.

615
00:49:21,428 --> 00:49:22,930
[door closes]

616
00:49:23,797 --> 00:49:26,299
[line ringing]

617
00:49:40,982 --> 00:49:42,649
[elevator bell dings]

618
00:50:04,105 --> 00:50:07,241
I hope you're here to report
progress in recovering our property.

619
00:50:07,374 --> 00:50:09,110
The investigation's developing.

620
00:50:09,243 --> 00:50:10,878
How are you related to the item?

621
00:50:11,012 --> 00:50:13,080
My firm represents the
holding company that owns it.

622
00:50:13,214 --> 00:50:16,026
They operate outside the US, and we're
registered to act as their agent here,

623
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:20,387
so when we learned of the loss,
we reported it as their agent.

624
00:50:20,520 --> 00:50:21,960
And what's the
holding company again?

625
00:50:22,089 --> 00:50:25,193
Argenti International.
Have you heard of it? Yes.

626
00:50:25,325 --> 00:50:28,830
Probably read our write-up in <i>The
Wall Street Journal.</i> Actually, no.

627
00:50:28,963 --> 00:50:32,099
I saw Interpol reports on front
companies for mob families.

628
00:50:32,233 --> 00:50:35,937
You must have confused Argenti with
some other less-reputable company.

629
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:38,505
I assure you, we're a perfectly
legitimate holding company.

630
00:50:38,638 --> 00:50:41,042
We specialize in global
real estate ventures.

631
00:50:41,175 --> 00:50:44,312
So, would you mind telling us what
the item was that you insured?

632
00:50:44,444 --> 00:50:46,013
Not at all, Mr...

633
00:50:46,147 --> 00:50:47,982
Agent Cooper. Owens.

634
00:50:48,615 --> 00:50:50,117
Cryptocurrency.

635
00:50:50,251 --> 00:50:51,986
And how much was it insured for?

636
00:50:52,119 --> 00:50:54,922
An amount equal to its current market
value, around two million dollars.

637
00:50:55,056 --> 00:50:56,423
[phone chimes]

638
00:50:58,092 --> 00:50:59,937
If there's nothing else I can
assist you gentlemen with,

639
00:50:59,961 --> 00:51:01,771
I have an important
conference call to attend to.

640
00:51:01,795 --> 00:51:04,497
We'll be in touch. Thank you.

641
00:51:10,637 --> 00:51:12,006
So what do you think?

642
00:51:12,139 --> 00:51:14,108
Two million? Yeah.

643
00:51:14,242 --> 00:51:17,187
No wonder these guys don't wanna scan the
neighborhood to find out what happened.

644
00:51:17,211 --> 00:51:19,113
They wanna claim insurance.

645
00:51:30,291 --> 00:51:32,492
[Afrobeat playing on radio]

646
00:51:32,626 --> 00:51:33,995
Thanks, man.

647
00:51:44,504 --> 00:51:45,739
Shit.

648
00:51:48,675 --> 00:51:51,279
[line ringing]

649
00:51:51,411 --> 00:51:55,482
Yeah, no. I was told to
call this number in an hour.

650
00:51:58,286 --> 00:51:59,519
Lamp store?

651
00:52:12,934 --> 00:52:14,368
Okay, thanks.

652
00:52:14,501 --> 00:52:17,737
Seems our ride-share driver
wasn't as bad off as we thought.

653
00:52:17,872 --> 00:52:20,374
Hospital called. This guy
checked himself out early.

654
00:52:20,507 --> 00:52:23,443
That's not a normal thing to do.
Apparently, right after we left.

655
00:52:23,576 --> 00:52:25,880
We'll look a little deeper.
Have Reed run his name again.

656
00:52:26,013 --> 00:52:28,950
Have her really run it, see what
she comes up with. Copy that.

657
00:52:30,117 --> 00:52:31,152
[Cooper] Hi, guys.

658
00:52:32,219 --> 00:52:35,856
So, Mr. Gibson, you have
something you wanna tell us?

659
00:52:36,924 --> 00:52:39,526
[Nick] Where is
Mr. Valenti? Hmm?

660
00:52:40,460 --> 00:52:41,963
Do you believe this guy?

661
00:52:42,930 --> 00:52:45,099
Let me tell you
something, wiseass.

662
00:52:45,232 --> 00:52:48,468
The only reason you're not
spitting out your teeth right now

663
00:52:48,601 --> 00:52:51,172
is I was told to listen
to what you had to say.

664
00:52:51,872 --> 00:52:54,275
You don't talk to Mr. Valenti.

665
00:52:55,443 --> 00:52:58,112
So you better start telling
me something I wanna hear.

666
00:52:58,245 --> 00:53:02,482
I want Mr. Valenti to know who robbed
him and that I can get it back for him.

667
00:53:02,615 --> 00:53:04,718
Don't mess with me, jackass.

668
00:53:05,820 --> 00:53:07,780
[Valenti] It's all right,
Joey. [Nick] Son of a...

669
00:53:07,822 --> 00:53:09,556
I wanna hear it for myself.

670
00:53:18,399 --> 00:53:23,971
Mr. Valenti, I can get you your
case that was stolen from the bank.

671
00:53:25,139 --> 00:53:26,173
How?

672
00:53:27,640 --> 00:53:29,176
I was in on the robbery.

673
00:53:31,846 --> 00:53:34,748
Tell me why I shouldn't
drop you here right now.

674
00:53:35,648 --> 00:53:37,451
Okay, okay.

675
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:40,687
The assistant bank
manager, he was in on it.

676
00:53:40,821 --> 00:53:43,157
That's how they
knew it was there.

677
00:53:43,290 --> 00:53:47,594
Now he's dead, but
I know who has it.

678
00:53:48,628 --> 00:53:49,729
Really? Yeah.

679
00:53:49,864 --> 00:53:51,932
'Cause they tried
to kill me too.

680
00:53:52,066 --> 00:53:55,302
So I see. You need protection.

681
00:53:55,436 --> 00:53:57,338
Yeah, but...

682
00:53:57,471 --> 00:53:58,839
[sighs] Mr. Valenti,

683
00:53:58,973 --> 00:54:02,642
I imagine that you have
this property well insured.

684
00:54:03,444 --> 00:54:04,912
And if so,

685
00:54:05,046 --> 00:54:07,515
you're positioned right
now to collect on that.

686
00:54:07,647 --> 00:54:11,886
But what if you could get the
insurance money and the case?

687
00:54:12,019 --> 00:54:14,687
Hmm? I mean,
that... [chuckles]

688
00:54:14,822 --> 00:54:16,190
That's win-win.

689
00:54:16,323 --> 00:54:19,592
And I'm the only one who
can get it back for you.

690
00:54:20,895 --> 00:54:23,264
And if you don't succeed?

691
00:54:24,065 --> 00:54:26,233
You still collect
the insurance money.

692
00:54:28,169 --> 00:54:30,247
So I'm sitting here, wondering,
why don't I have Pete here

693
00:54:30,271 --> 00:54:33,340
just break your fingers one by
one until you tell me who has it?

694
00:54:34,375 --> 00:54:37,211
Because I can get it
back for you a lot easier

695
00:54:37,344 --> 00:54:39,712
with all my fingers.

696
00:54:41,015 --> 00:54:43,250
[chuckles]

697
00:54:43,384 --> 00:54:45,352
You got some balls on you.

698
00:54:45,486 --> 00:54:49,090
But you screw with us, and I will feed
them to you. Do you understand me?

699
00:54:49,223 --> 00:54:50,391
Yeah.

700
00:54:50,524 --> 00:54:51,892
Whoa.

701
00:54:52,026 --> 00:54:53,693
Look, I need your guys' help.

702
00:54:59,500 --> 00:55:01,068
Let me see if I
got this straight.

703
00:55:01,202 --> 00:55:03,270
You steal from me,
they steal from you,

704
00:55:03,404 --> 00:55:06,941
and now you wanna steal back from
them so you can give it to me?

705
00:55:07,074 --> 00:55:08,442
What's in it for you?

706
00:55:08,576 --> 00:55:10,244
Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.

707
00:55:12,379 --> 00:55:13,981
[sighs]

708
00:55:17,750 --> 00:55:20,720
A procedure for my daughter.

709
00:55:20,855 --> 00:55:22,289
She's very sick.

710
00:55:23,124 --> 00:55:24,191
So I get it.

711
00:55:24,325 --> 00:55:26,726
You want what's coming to you.

712
00:55:26,861 --> 00:55:29,263
Fifteen percent of
about four million.

713
00:55:29,396 --> 00:55:30,931
500 grand?

714
00:55:33,633 --> 00:55:35,635
I'm not gonna let her die.

715
00:55:43,844 --> 00:55:45,279
[exhales]

716
00:55:45,412 --> 00:55:48,315
At ease, boys. Jesus.

717
00:55:56,323 --> 00:55:59,260
[Owens] That's a lot of Eric
Thompsons. Twenty-six in Nevada State.

718
00:55:59,393 --> 00:56:02,830
Any of them have a record? One.
Breaking, entering and forgery.

719
00:56:02,963 --> 00:56:04,565
Well, that's good.
Does he have an ID?

720
00:56:04,697 --> 00:56:07,001
[typing on keyboard]

721
00:56:08,369 --> 00:56:09,870
Erica Thompson.

722
00:56:11,172 --> 00:56:13,641
None of us could get
a match either. No.

723
00:56:13,773 --> 00:56:15,876
And Ride said he's
squeaky clean.

724
00:56:16,010 --> 00:56:18,812
Been driving there six
months, just like he said.

725
00:56:20,014 --> 00:56:21,815
Okay, square one.

726
00:56:23,017 --> 00:56:24,760
This ain't working. Let's
get everyone together.

727
00:56:24,784 --> 00:56:26,320
We gotta try
something different.

728
00:56:28,422 --> 00:56:29,924
Okay, listen up.

729
00:56:30,858 --> 00:56:33,394
We need to cast a wider
net here. All right?

730
00:56:33,527 --> 00:56:36,597
I wanna pull every assault
with a deadly weapon record,

731
00:56:36,729 --> 00:56:38,365
every robbery within
the last six months,

732
00:56:38,499 --> 00:56:41,801
every Snickers bar shoplifted in
the state of Nevada. You with me?

733
00:56:41,936 --> 00:56:45,573
Then we need to pull the vacation
or sick days of every employee

734
00:56:45,705 --> 00:56:49,210
working for the hotels, local
unions, construction companies

735
00:56:49,343 --> 00:56:51,278
or whatever
companies we can get.

736
00:56:51,412 --> 00:56:53,857
And we need to cross-reference those
together for the date of the robbery.

737
00:56:53,881 --> 00:56:57,885
And if anyone gets a hit, or
anything remotely resembling a hit,

738
00:56:58,018 --> 00:56:59,752
you contact me or
you contact Owens.

739
00:56:59,887 --> 00:57:00,887
You got it? [all] Got it.

740
00:57:00,921 --> 00:57:02,156
Let's go.

741
00:57:10,030 --> 00:57:12,799
[phone buzzing]

742
00:57:16,470 --> 00:57:18,339
[Jack sighs]

743
00:57:22,509 --> 00:57:26,213
What's with you guys not
following simple instructions?

744
00:57:27,047 --> 00:57:28,515
Jack, Willis is dead.

745
00:57:28,649 --> 00:57:29,883
What?

746
00:57:33,387 --> 00:57:34,421
Where?

747
00:57:38,993 --> 00:57:40,327
How'd it happen?

748
00:57:44,732 --> 00:57:47,134
You talk to any cops?

749
00:57:48,035 --> 00:57:49,802
Where's the case?

750
00:57:49,937 --> 00:57:51,905
Jerry has it at his place.

751
00:57:52,039 --> 00:57:54,308
Go get it now.

752
00:57:54,441 --> 00:57:57,111
Get the hell out of
there and don't go back.

753
00:57:58,979 --> 00:58:01,081
They will tie Willis to you.

754
00:58:02,816 --> 00:58:05,953
<i>Dump this phone and get
a new number and call me.</i>

755
00:58:06,086 --> 00:58:08,055
I'll text you, got it?

756
00:58:08,188 --> 00:58:10,057
Hey, who gets his share?

757
00:58:10,991 --> 00:58:11,991
[phone beeps]

758
00:58:12,026 --> 00:58:14,295
What's going on?

759
00:58:14,928 --> 00:58:16,730
Willis is dead.

760
00:58:16,864 --> 00:58:18,365
What? How?

761
00:58:19,400 --> 00:58:21,068
[sighs]

762
00:58:22,069 --> 00:58:24,138
These guys are getting greedy.

763
00:58:26,307 --> 00:58:29,276
Willis was a stupid
junkie, always has been.

764
00:58:29,410 --> 00:58:32,112
One less dumbass to deal with.

765
00:58:36,950 --> 00:58:38,319
Where you going?

766
00:58:41,021 --> 00:58:42,523
I gotta go to work.

767
00:58:54,101 --> 00:58:58,238
[electronic music
playing on radio]

768
00:59:00,407 --> 00:59:03,010
How long you been in
this line of work, Pete?

769
00:59:10,017 --> 00:59:12,019
You are going to need this.

770
00:59:15,656 --> 00:59:17,826
[phone rings]

771
00:59:20,160 --> 00:59:22,930
Hey, Xander. What's going on?

772
00:59:23,931 --> 00:59:25,265
Yeah, okay.

773
00:59:38,912 --> 00:59:40,948
Get my hot sauce? Yeah.

774
00:59:42,683 --> 00:59:43,917
Nice.

775
00:59:44,752 --> 00:59:46,186
How's she doing?

776
00:59:46,320 --> 00:59:48,322
She's hungry.
That's a good sign.

777
00:59:48,455 --> 00:59:49,490
Yeah.

778
00:59:50,224 --> 00:59:51,592
I appreciate you doing this.

779
00:59:51,725 --> 00:59:53,527
Of course, man. I got you.

780
00:59:55,763 --> 00:59:56,997
Oh, hey.

781
00:59:57,798 --> 00:59:59,299
Might need that.

782
01:00:00,601 --> 01:00:02,201
[Nick] This is how you
do it... like this.

783
01:00:02,302 --> 01:00:04,047
And then you go like
that. Dad, that's boring.

784
01:00:04,071 --> 01:00:05,239
And then you do this.

785
01:00:05,372 --> 01:00:06,774
Let's eat. You do the twist.

786
01:00:06,907 --> 01:00:08,942
Twist? I'm gonna
get everything.

787
01:00:09,076 --> 01:00:10,611
I'm gonna get a big
bite. Oh, my God.

788
01:00:10,744 --> 01:00:12,946
What? [nurse] She's
not allowed visitors.

789
01:00:13,080 --> 01:00:15,582
I'm sorry. Immediate
family only.

790
01:00:16,250 --> 01:00:19,052
Uh, it's okay. She's okay.

791
01:00:20,020 --> 01:00:21,922
How are you, Emma?

792
01:00:23,056 --> 01:00:25,292
You know, great.

793
01:00:28,128 --> 01:00:30,197
You dating my dad
again, or what?

794
01:00:31,765 --> 01:00:35,436
I'm sorry. I need to take
Emma for a scheduled MRI.

795
01:00:37,037 --> 01:00:38,639
I'll see you in a
little bit, okay?

796
01:00:38,772 --> 01:00:40,307
She's not gonna be that long.

797
01:00:40,441 --> 01:00:42,109
Are you ready, dear? Mm-hmm.

798
01:00:54,755 --> 01:00:56,523
I bet you're here a lot.

799
01:00:58,058 --> 01:01:00,093
Any news on Emma's progress?

800
01:01:02,563 --> 01:01:04,364
Why are you here?

801
01:01:04,498 --> 01:01:07,534
Look, I didn't know.
I'm glad you're okay.

802
01:01:08,569 --> 01:01:10,537
Does your boyfriend
know that you're here?

803
01:01:10,671 --> 01:01:12,406
No.

804
01:01:14,141 --> 01:01:16,543
[sighs] Nick. Where
are my drives?

805
01:01:18,813 --> 01:01:20,047
Hmm?

806
01:01:27,488 --> 01:01:28,589
[sighs]

807
01:01:30,691 --> 01:01:32,025
What's this?

808
01:01:32,159 --> 01:01:34,294
It's what you want.

809
01:01:34,428 --> 01:01:35,762
[sniffs]

810
01:01:48,542 --> 01:01:50,677
And how do I know
that's not a setup?

811
01:01:50,812 --> 01:01:53,882
You have to believe me. I didn't
mean for any of this to happen.

812
01:01:54,014 --> 01:01:56,083
How can I trust you?

813
01:01:56,216 --> 01:01:57,751
What is wrong with you?

814
01:01:57,886 --> 01:02:00,687
What... What is wrong with me?

815
01:02:01,555 --> 01:02:03,858
Your boyfriend tried to kill me.

816
01:02:03,992 --> 01:02:05,659
I had nothing to do with it.

817
01:02:05,792 --> 01:02:07,996
Wow. Wait, wait.

818
01:02:08,128 --> 01:02:10,364
Goodbye, Nick. Veronica, wait.

819
01:02:10,497 --> 01:02:11,532
God...

820
01:02:16,236 --> 01:02:19,673
No, no, that's okay. I have the
file. I can send it right now.

821
01:02:21,074 --> 01:02:24,077
What do you got? Do you remember
the dead guy we found in the car?

822
01:02:24,211 --> 01:02:25,479
Mm-hmm. Bobby Willis.

823
01:02:25,612 --> 01:02:27,323
The medical examiner just
finished with this guy.

824
01:02:27,347 --> 01:02:31,718
Check it out. Heart attack,
asphyxiation, overdose.

825
01:02:31,853 --> 01:02:34,053
They found large amounts of
cocaine in this guy's system.

826
01:02:34,154 --> 01:02:35,789
Mostly likely,
fentanyl. Is that right?

827
01:02:35,924 --> 01:02:39,393
And he called in sick
the day of the robbery.

828
01:02:39,526 --> 01:02:42,229
Bobby Willis. I
know that name.

829
01:02:42,362 --> 01:02:45,098
Two armed robberies. One of
them was an armored truck.

830
01:02:45,232 --> 01:02:46,700
Mm-hmm, that's right.

831
01:02:46,834 --> 01:02:49,003
So listen, toxicology report's
gonna take a few days,

832
01:02:49,136 --> 01:02:51,772
but they found he had
a crushed trachea.

833
01:03:00,647 --> 01:03:01,748
Now what?

834
01:03:01,883 --> 01:03:04,953
Now we see if Willis was
involved in the robbery

835
01:03:05,085 --> 01:03:06,620
and who his associates were.

836
01:03:06,753 --> 01:03:08,522
I did a last-known-associates
checkup,

837
01:03:08,655 --> 01:03:10,925
and I came up with
one name only.

838
01:03:11,059 --> 01:03:12,125
Jerry Foster.

839
01:03:12,259 --> 01:03:13,694
Jerry Foster.

840
01:03:13,828 --> 01:03:16,064
Parole officer says he and
Willis did a stint together.

841
01:03:16,196 --> 01:03:17,865
Got released about
the same time.

842
01:03:17,999 --> 01:03:21,335
And the PO officer also says that
Foster has been seeing a dancer

843
01:03:21,468 --> 01:03:24,104
that goes by the name of
Monica Smith, aka Monique.

844
01:03:24,237 --> 01:03:26,040
Monique. You got an address?

845
01:03:26,173 --> 01:03:29,676
Sure do. Kenwood 1519.

846
01:03:30,377 --> 01:03:33,447
1519. Let's go.
[engine starts]

847
01:03:40,120 --> 01:03:45,726
Well, I mean, if this is what I think
it is, two guys should live here.

Jerry, is that you?

853
01:05:47,081 --> 01:05:48,850
Are you kidding me?

854
01:05:48,983 --> 01:05:50,283
I don't know.

Shh. [Ms. Foster]
Jerry, is that you?

857
01:06:07,634 --> 01:06:11,038
It's okay, Ms. Foster.
It's just me, Sully.

858
01:06:11,671 --> 01:06:12,706
Shit.

859
01:06:14,441 --> 01:06:16,309
You son of a...

860

[Nick groans]

868
01:06:58,752 --> 01:07:00,620
You need somewhere to take him?

869
01:07:01,454 --> 01:07:03,291
Yeah, I have...

870
01:07:03,423 --> 01:07:04,992
I have some questions.

871
01:07:06,928 --> 01:07:08,361
I know a place.

Police.

874
01:07:35,089 --> 01:07:36,456
What can I do for you?

875
01:07:36,590 --> 01:07:39,026
Hi. We're wondering if
a Jerry Foster's here.

876
01:07:39,160 --> 01:07:40,594
What'd he do now?

877
01:07:42,562 --> 01:07:44,598
He ain't been around
for a few days.

878
01:07:44,731 --> 01:07:46,433
Okay. Does he live here?

879
01:07:46,566 --> 01:07:48,602
Comes and goes.

880
01:07:49,237 --> 01:07:50,537
Okay.

881
01:07:50,670 --> 01:07:52,706
Can you tell us anything
about any of his friends?

882
01:07:55,675 --> 01:07:58,179
Can we come in and
take a look around?

883
01:07:58,312 --> 01:07:59,613
You got a warrant?
[Owens] Hey.

884
01:07:59,746 --> 01:08:01,949
[Cooper] No, what we do
have is probable cause,

885
01:08:02,083 --> 01:08:03,450
and you are on probation,

886
01:08:03,583 --> 01:08:06,120
so maybe you should work
with us a little bit.

887
01:08:08,022 --> 01:08:10,724
Only guy I know of is
someone named Sullivan.

888
01:08:10,858 --> 01:08:12,792
Sometimes he crashes at
Jerry's mother's house

889
01:08:12,927 --> 01:08:14,996
somewhere on Durango Terrace.

890
01:08:16,931 --> 01:08:18,933
We don't talk much
when he's here.

891
01:08:19,066 --> 01:08:22,702
Okay. Thank you.
We appreciate it.

892
01:08:24,338 --> 01:08:25,572
[Owens] Thank you.

893
01:08:28,976 --> 01:08:32,512
Okay, call Reed. Have her check
on that Durango Terrace address.

894
01:08:32,646 --> 01:08:34,481
Already on it.

895
01:08:35,482 --> 01:08:37,084
[gasps]

896
01:08:37,484 --> 01:08:38,785
[coughs]

897
01:08:39,519 --> 01:08:40,821
Hey!

898
01:08:42,256 --> 01:08:44,658
[grunts] What the hell?

899
01:08:45,692 --> 01:08:48,229
Hey, hey, hey.

900
01:08:48,362 --> 01:08:49,763
Where you meeting Jack?

901
01:08:50,664 --> 01:08:52,532
Hmm? What are you
talking about?

902
01:08:52,666 --> 01:08:55,769
Where's my goddamn
briefcase, hmm?

903
01:08:57,405 --> 01:08:59,173
Screw you.

904
01:09:01,175 --> 01:09:02,575
Can I try?

905
01:09:03,144 --> 01:09:04,178
Please.

906
01:09:04,845 --> 01:09:07,181
Who's this, your boyfriend?

907
01:09:07,315 --> 01:09:09,616
[chuckles] You'll find out.

908
01:09:12,153 --> 01:09:14,922
[screams]

909
01:09:15,056 --> 01:09:16,357
God.

910
01:09:16,489 --> 01:09:17,959
[groans]

911
01:09:18,826 --> 01:09:20,527
He ask you a question.

912
01:09:21,062 --> 01:09:23,064
[laughing]

913
01:09:25,498 --> 01:09:28,903
Oh, I am looking at
a dead man right now.

914
01:09:31,339 --> 01:09:32,572
[groans]

915
01:09:36,310 --> 01:09:37,777
[Sullivan] No. No.

916
01:09:38,478 --> 01:09:40,047
No. [grunts]

917
01:09:41,048 --> 01:09:43,217
No. No. Mm-mmm.

918
01:09:44,018 --> 01:09:46,854
No. [groaning]

919
01:09:51,325 --> 01:09:53,526
No. No. No.

920
01:09:54,561 --> 01:09:58,798
No. [screams]

921
01:10:02,236 --> 01:10:05,072
Okay, okay, okay.

922
01:10:06,974 --> 01:10:08,242
Talk!

923
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:15,883
I don't know where he is.

924
01:10:17,885 --> 01:10:19,353
Really. [sighs]

925
01:10:19,487 --> 01:10:21,521
Really, I don't.

926
01:10:24,791 --> 01:10:26,626
I don't know where he is.

927
01:10:28,229 --> 01:10:29,529
Really.

928
01:10:41,175 --> 01:10:42,810
What the hell is this?

929
01:10:44,145 --> 01:10:47,415
[motor whirring]
Shit just got real.

930
01:10:47,547 --> 01:10:49,183
[electricity crackles]

931
01:10:54,889 --> 01:10:56,857
What the hell is this?

932
01:10:58,792 --> 01:11:03,097
I won't stop until I know
where I can find Jack.

933
01:11:05,632 --> 01:11:09,803
And how far we go is up to you.

934
01:11:10,371 --> 01:11:13,340
[current humming]

935
01:11:16,177 --> 01:11:18,778
[screaming]

936
01:11:22,049 --> 01:11:23,716
Okay! Okay!

937
01:11:25,618 --> 01:11:27,754
Free... Freeport Casino.

938
01:11:28,489 --> 01:11:29,890
Tomorrow night.

939
01:11:34,428 --> 01:11:35,695
Attaboy.

940
01:11:42,069 --> 01:11:43,137
Good work.

941
01:11:49,243 --> 01:11:50,277
How's my gym?

942
01:11:52,279 --> 01:11:53,746
My gym is fine.

943
01:11:59,386 --> 01:12:00,753
Where were you?

944
01:12:01,555 --> 01:12:02,857
You know where I was.

945
01:12:02,990 --> 01:12:05,326
No, I don't. You
weren't at the gym.

946
01:12:11,599 --> 01:12:13,067
I don't care.

947
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:15,503
I know you have
feelings for him.

948
01:12:15,635 --> 01:12:18,705
You don't care about me or you
don't care that he's alive?

949
01:12:21,842 --> 01:12:23,277
What the hell, Jack?

950
01:12:23,410 --> 01:12:24,777
Calm down.

951
01:12:24,912 --> 01:12:26,247
Don't tell me to calm down.

952
01:12:26,380 --> 01:12:28,648
You went behind my back,
tried to take out my friend.

953
01:12:28,781 --> 01:12:30,650
You wanna take me out too, huh?

954
01:12:30,783 --> 01:12:33,521
[gasps] I saw an opportunity.

955
01:12:33,653 --> 01:12:35,722
So I took it. So what?

956
01:12:35,856 --> 01:12:40,227
That's the difference between
people like you and people like me.

957
01:12:40,727 --> 01:12:42,530
I make things happen.

958
01:12:42,662 --> 01:12:44,664
I'm a winner. [spits]

959
01:12:44,797 --> 01:12:46,834
Ran out of coke, huh?

960
01:12:46,967 --> 01:12:49,669
I got you a little
refill there. [shouts]

961
01:12:49,802 --> 01:12:52,705
You going through withdrawals
here? Is that what's going on here?

962
01:12:53,740 --> 01:12:54,975
Hmm?

963
01:12:57,111 --> 01:12:58,445
[screams]

964
01:12:58,579 --> 01:13:00,881
[shouting, grunts]

965
01:13:01,015 --> 01:13:02,850
You need a little snort?

966
01:13:04,585 --> 01:13:05,853
[shouts]

967
01:13:08,923 --> 01:13:13,227
How about you stay here? I'll go do
this deal, and you just stay grateful.

968
01:13:13,360 --> 01:13:15,663
No! We had a deal.

969
01:13:15,795 --> 01:13:18,098
I do this, and I'm paid off.

970
01:13:18,933 --> 01:13:22,236
You want him? You
wanna be a lowlife?

971
01:13:24,004 --> 01:13:25,705
There's the door.

972
01:13:25,839 --> 01:13:27,942
You better get
your shit straight.

973
01:13:28,075 --> 01:13:30,444
[breathing heavily]

974
01:13:54,767 --> 01:13:58,439
[cartoon music,
sounds playing on TV]

975
01:14:04,912 --> 01:14:06,146
Police.

976
01:14:24,498 --> 01:14:25,532
[Owens] Gun!

977
01:14:36,844 --> 01:14:38,612
Come on, Jerry. We got
the place surrounded.

978
01:14:38,746 --> 01:14:40,881
Jerry, is that you?

979
01:14:45,152 --> 01:14:46,186
Jerry?

980
01:14:47,621 --> 01:14:49,490
[glass shatters, clattering]

981
01:14:51,859 --> 01:14:53,127
[door slams open]

982
01:14:59,967 --> 01:15:02,236
Call it in. Copy that.

983
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:04,438
[radio beeps]

984
01:15:10,577 --> 01:15:13,113
[lock turns, clicks]

985
01:15:39,740 --> 01:15:41,942
[phone rings]

986
01:15:44,378 --> 01:15:46,980
[sighs] You get my
text about the drop?

987
01:15:47,114 --> 01:15:49,116
Yeah, I'll be there.

988
01:15:49,249 --> 01:15:51,085
Good. Don't screw this up.

989
01:15:51,218 --> 01:15:53,654
Easy exchange, and
we all get a cut.

990
01:15:53,787 --> 01:15:55,189
We'll see.

991
01:15:56,890 --> 01:15:58,325
[alarm chirps]

992
01:16:25,052 --> 01:16:27,154
[vehicle approaching]

993
01:16:42,703 --> 01:16:44,204
[police radio chatter]

994
01:16:44,338 --> 01:16:47,641
Where you taking that stuff?
That's my stuff. Don't...

995
01:16:47,775 --> 01:16:50,544
Bring that back here. I'm
gonna call the police.

996
01:16:53,680 --> 01:16:56,116
It's okay, sweetheart.
We are the police.

997
01:16:56,250 --> 01:16:58,152
You're okay. Listen. I'm
gonna call the police.

998
01:16:58,285 --> 01:16:59,888
We... We are the police, love.

999
01:17:00,020 --> 01:17:01,688
It's okay.

1000
01:17:01,823 --> 01:17:03,590
Look after her. Sir, got 'em.

1001
01:17:03,724 --> 01:17:05,626
Good. Catalog that.

1002
01:17:05,759 --> 01:17:08,595
Take a look at this.
Found it on the fridge.

1003
01:17:08,729 --> 01:17:12,499
Before you ask, it's a cell phone
number. It belongs to a Jerry Foster.

1004
01:17:12,633 --> 01:17:15,035
Call us when you get
a ping. You got it.

1005
01:17:15,169 --> 01:17:16,970
That's for you.

1006
01:17:54,675 --> 01:17:56,310
Pull over here.

1007
01:19:10,818 --> 01:19:12,686
Yep, what do you got?

1008
01:19:14,454 --> 01:19:16,891
Yeah, of course I know where
that is. We're on our way.

1009
01:19:17,025 --> 01:19:18,759
Send for backup.
We may need it.

1010
01:19:18,893 --> 01:19:21,495
Reed got a ping on
that number. Let's go.

1011
01:19:53,660 --> 01:19:54,528
What the hell?

1012
01:19:54,661 --> 01:19:57,297
Somebody must've paid the bill.

1013
01:20:42,175 --> 01:20:43,210
Dead?

1014
01:20:43,343 --> 01:20:44,812
Still a pulse.

1015
01:20:44,946 --> 01:20:46,680
[gunshots]

1016
01:20:50,717 --> 01:20:51,752
[gunshot]

1017
01:20:51,886 --> 01:20:54,287
What the hell did
you do to him, Jack?

1018
01:20:59,127 --> 01:21:00,962
Just taking us out one by one?

1019
01:21:01,095 --> 01:21:03,263
What are you talking
about, Jerry?

1020
01:21:04,665 --> 01:21:05,699
[gunshot]

1021
01:21:07,434 --> 01:21:09,202
You and that stupid
whore do this?

1022
01:21:10,972 --> 01:21:14,474
You guys are the ones that
got greedy. This wasn't us.

1023
01:21:18,578 --> 01:21:21,381
What are you talking
about? Then who did?

1024
01:21:36,998 --> 01:21:38,498
Where's the money?

1025
01:21:41,401 --> 01:21:44,939
Okay, easy. It's close by.

1026
01:21:46,174 --> 01:21:47,407
Here's the deal.

1027
01:21:47,541 --> 01:21:50,577
You give me the case,
and you get your money.

1028
01:21:54,048 --> 01:21:55,917
Set it down.

1029
01:21:57,718 --> 01:22:00,787
Tell you what. You want more?

1030
01:22:05,492 --> 01:22:07,627
Easy now. Easy.

1031
01:22:10,098 --> 01:22:11,465
Jerry, don't be stupid.

1032
01:22:29,449 --> 01:22:30,784
[exhales]

1033
01:22:36,523 --> 01:22:38,391
[exhales] [gunshot]

1034
01:22:43,764 --> 01:22:44,798
Nick?

1035
01:22:48,870 --> 01:22:50,504
Drop the gun, Jack.

1036
01:22:54,441 --> 01:22:56,276
Oh, we make a nice threesome.

1037
01:22:59,881 --> 01:23:01,581
Do you love her?

1038
01:23:04,317 --> 01:23:05,752
[gunshot]

1039
01:23:07,221 --> 01:23:08,956
[grunts]

1040
01:23:09,090 --> 01:23:10,490
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1041
01:23:10,624 --> 01:23:12,692
No, no. Oh, shit.

1042
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:14,862
No, no, no, hang on, hang on.

1043
01:23:14,996 --> 01:23:17,464
You're gonna be okay. I'm
gonna get you out of here.

1044
01:23:17,597 --> 01:23:20,500
Shit, shit, shit, shit.

1045
01:23:20,634 --> 01:23:23,336
Hang on, hang on.
You stay with me.

1046
01:23:24,105 --> 01:23:26,339
Okay? You'll be fine.

1047
01:23:29,609 --> 01:23:31,478
What took you so long?

1048
01:23:36,783 --> 01:23:39,653
Shh. It's fine, it's fine.

1049
01:23:39,786 --> 01:23:42,589
Mr. Valenti wanted
me to give you this,

1050
01:23:43,356 --> 01:23:44,926
for your daughter.

1051
01:23:47,627 --> 01:23:50,965
Shh. Hang on, hang
on. Nick, I'm sorry.

1052
01:23:52,300 --> 01:23:54,902
[groaning]

1053
01:23:55,036 --> 01:23:56,803
[gasps]

1054
01:24:01,976 --> 01:24:03,010
You need my help?

1055
01:24:03,978 --> 01:24:05,012
No.

1056
01:25:38,005 --> 01:25:40,207
Looks like we're a little
late for this party.

1057
01:25:40,341 --> 01:25:41,775
Yeah, I guess so.

1058
01:25:42,542 --> 01:25:44,145
You remember this guy?

1059
01:25:45,146 --> 01:25:47,048
[Owens] Jerry Foster.

1060
01:25:47,181 --> 01:25:48,215
[Cooper] That's right.

1061
01:25:50,750 --> 01:25:53,220
What are we
missing, Owens? Hmm?

1062
01:25:53,354 --> 01:25:54,754
What are we missing here?

1063
01:25:57,657 --> 01:25:58,893
What are you thinking?

1064
01:26:00,995 --> 01:26:03,097
Trajectory. It
doesn't make sense.

1065
01:26:03,230 --> 01:26:04,597
Look at his feet.

1066
01:26:04,966 --> 01:26:06,000
Okay?

1067
01:26:14,774 --> 01:26:16,010
Dust 'em up.

1068
01:26:16,844 --> 01:26:18,813
Anything? No, sir.

1069
01:26:20,047 --> 01:26:23,050
Okay, keep looking.
I'm gonna be outside.

1070
01:26:27,520 --> 01:26:29,556
I mean, who knows?

1071
01:26:29,689 --> 01:26:33,227
I'm sure these guys all probably
had side deals with each other.

1072
01:26:33,361 --> 01:26:36,596
That's why they met here, right?
Split the proceeds from the robbery.

1073
01:26:36,730 --> 01:26:38,132
Where's the money?

1074
01:26:39,100 --> 01:26:40,134
Give me that.

1075
01:26:43,703 --> 01:26:47,341
Okay, the getaway van and all
the crew have been accounted for,

1076
01:26:47,475 --> 01:26:49,810
so, you think...

1077
01:26:49,944 --> 01:26:51,912
What about the cryptocurrency?

1078
01:26:52,512 --> 01:26:53,848
Unaccounted for.

1079
01:26:53,981 --> 01:26:56,450
All accounted for,
but no Eric Thompson.

1080
01:26:56,583 --> 01:26:59,253
What, you were expecting
to find him here?

1081
01:27:00,421 --> 01:27:01,721
Now do me a favor.

1082
01:27:01,856 --> 01:27:04,557
See if any of these
folks worked or rode

1083
01:27:04,691 --> 01:27:07,194
for any of these
ride-share companies, okay?

1084
01:27:07,328 --> 01:27:08,561
Okay.

1085
01:28:18,966 --> 01:28:20,868
[Pete] Monsieur Charpentier?

1086
01:28:21,001 --> 01:28:22,369
Pete.

1087
01:28:22,503 --> 01:28:24,004
Right on time. [speaks French]

1088
01:28:24,138 --> 01:28:25,206
[speaks French]

1089
01:28:27,308 --> 01:28:28,708
What happened?

1090
01:28:38,819 --> 01:28:40,087
Where's the seed phrase?

1091
01:28:40,221 --> 01:28:42,923
Seeds? It was in the
case. Now it's not.

1092
01:28:43,057 --> 01:28:46,994
Mr. Valenti told us to
drop it off. That's all.

1093
01:28:47,128 --> 01:28:49,930
Other than that, we know
nothing about seeds.

1094
01:28:51,599 --> 01:28:53,666
Payment's due in 30 days.

1095
01:29:03,511 --> 01:29:05,813
They're worthless
without the seed phrase.

1096
01:29:05,946 --> 01:29:08,048
It's out of our hands, okay?

1097
01:29:10,084 --> 01:29:12,752
What can I say? Pete.

1098
01:29:13,988 --> 01:29:16,123
<i>Merde!</i> [grunts]

1099
01:29:21,328 --> 01:29:23,364
[laughs]
