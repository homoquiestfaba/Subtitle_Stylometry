1
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:16,085
"It's time for you to be asleep, Billy."

2
00:00:16,149 --> 00:00:17,719
"I'm not a bit sleepy."

3
00:00:17,784 --> 00:00:19,923
"You have to get up early tomorrow,
remember?"

4
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:21,932
"Oh, I don't want to go to bed yet."

5
00:00:21,988 --> 00:00:27,097
"It's bed time and sleep time."

6
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:29,800
"You'll be asleep before you know it.'

7
00:00:29,863 --> 00:00:31,774
"Goodnight, Billy."

8
00:00:31,831 --> 00:00:35,643
"Billy's mother didn't know the real reason
why he didn't want to go to bed."

9
00:03:05,151 --> 00:03:12,296
Even though I've had lots and lots of people tell me, "You've given
me nightmares," for years, they always have a smile on their face.

10
00:03:12,358 --> 00:03:16,670
Freddy operates on a lot of levels: as a character,
as a symbol, now as a logo.

11
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:20,541
He's an American original. I can't think of
anybody like Freddy.

12
00:03:20,600 --> 00:03:22,546
He's kind of the rock star of boogeymen.

13
00:03:22,602 --> 00:03:25,674
I think Freddy was to dreams
what Jaws was to swimmers.

14
00:03:25,738 --> 00:03:30,847
It is so on the surface scary, it is so scary when
you think about who he is and where he comes from.

15
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:34,221
He was this child molester, you know, that
the parents came after him and they burned him.

16
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:37,022
And then he comes back

17
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,494
and kills what they love.

18
00:03:38,551 --> 00:03:42,192
Freddy makes no apologies,
Freddy is on a revenge motif.

19
00:03:42,255 --> 00:03:46,635
Freddy Krueger has a plan,
Freddy Krueger has a reason.

20
00:03:46,693 --> 00:03:48,730
He is a metaphysical monster.

21
00:03:48,795 --> 00:03:50,741
He moves into our dreams.

22
00:03:50,797 --> 00:03:56,008
He doesn't have any time and space limitation.
That's what makes Freddy a little more fun to watch.

23
00:03:56,069 --> 00:03:59,380
The "Nightmare" movies were more
complicated and ambitious.

24
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,581
It's different from "Texas Chainsaw Massacre"
or "Halloween" or "Friday the 13th."

25
00:04:03,643 --> 00:04:05,884
You never, ever feel like you're

26
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,151
in a slasher movie.

27
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:10,285
It's more fun, it's more open ended,
it's more infinite.

28
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:15,163
It wasn't superficial.
That's one of the things that makes honor films great.

29
00:04:15,221 --> 00:04:16,859
"Nightmare on Elm Street" series,

30
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,995
particularly, speaks to these adolescent fears

31
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:21,834
of not having control.

32
00:04:21,894 --> 00:04:26,172
You can only trust kids of your own age
to even believe in Freddy Krueger.

33
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:27,905
And all the adults are telling you,

34
00:04:27,967 --> 00:04:30,573
"Get some sleep." "Get to sleep."
"Get some rest."

35
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:32,742
And you know that's the worst
possible thing you can do.

36
00:04:32,805 --> 00:04:36,116
You can look at classic movie monsters -

37
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:37,586
Frankenstein's monster, the Mummy, Dracula --

38
00:04:37,644 --> 00:04:39,646
and Freddy just fits right in there with them.

39
00:04:39,712 --> 00:04:43,785
"A Nightmare on Elm Street" not only speaks
the language of cinema, but it speaks

40
00:04:43,850 --> 00:04:49,562
this universal story of the bad dream,
the nightmare and the boogeyman.

41
00:05:02,368 --> 00:05:07,249
In the early 1980s, Wes Craven --
best known for such brutal films as

42
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:10,288
"Last House On The Left" and "The Hills Have Eyes"

43
00:05:10,343 --> 00:05:15,224
would find the inspiration for his
most innovative project in the pages of real life.

44
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:19,423
The beginning of "Nightmare on Elm Street"
really came to me with a series of articles

45
00:05:19,485 --> 00:05:23,695
in the L.A. Times about a young men who were
dying in the middle of nightmares.

46
00:05:23,756 --> 00:05:27,465
They were specifically from the Asian Rim
and in this particular case

47
00:05:27,527 --> 00:05:30,133
a young man had a severe nightmare
and told his parents,

48
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:32,938
"I can't go back to sleep, I'm gonna die,
I just know it."

49
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:37,573
And the father was a physician and said,
"Let me give you some sleeping pills."

50
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:41,881
The kid didn't sleep the first night,
then the second night he didn't sleep again.

51
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:45,684
And then it became clear that he was
trying to stay awake despite everything.

52
00:05:45,745 --> 00:05:50,990
Then finally the kid fell asleep and
they took him upstairs and put him to bed thinking,

53
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,291
"Thank God that little crisis is over."

54
00:05:53,353 --> 00:05:57,426
And in the middle of the night they heard
screams and ran into the room and he was thrashing

55
00:05:57,490 --> 00:05:58,662
on the bed horribly.

56
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:02,332
Literally, before they got to him he fell still
and he was dead.

57
00:06:02,395 --> 00:06:04,932
In the aftermath, the parents found

58
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:08,035
all the sleeping pills. He had not taken them,
he had hidden them in the bed.

59
00:06:08,101 --> 00:06:13,642
And they also found a Mr. Coffee machine in his closet
with the hidden extension cord that went to the nearest plug

60
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:17,552
which, to me, was just so out of a movie.

61
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:20,216
What if there was somebody in his dream that <i>was,</i>

62
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:24,989
who killed him? What killed him? What if it's a guy?
My ovim Bible training of the sins of the parents

63
00:06:25,051 --> 00:06:30,091
being visited on the children. That's perfect as
something the parents did to him and just kind of

64
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:30,861
pieced it together from there.

65
00:06:30,957 --> 00:06:34,769
The reason Elm Street was used is that
I wanted to have an idea

66
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:37,501
of a place that was just pure Americana.

67
00:06:37,563 --> 00:06:41,978
The school I taught at before l jumped ship
out of academic teaching

68
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:47,143
was Clarkson College of Technology in Potsdam, New York
and the main street of Potsdam is Elm Street.

69
00:06:47,206 --> 00:06:49,311
And then, of course, Elm Street was the street that

70
00:06:49,375 --> 00:06:51,821
Kennedy was shot on.

71
00:06:51,878 --> 00:06:54,984
I remember showing it to Sean Cunningham,
who did "Friday the 13th."

72
00:06:55,047 --> 00:06:56,185
He was my first producer

73
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:58,422
and he said, "I hate to say it, but
nobody's going to be afraid of this

74
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:00,862
'cause it's a dream, they'll know
it's a dream so they won't be afraid."

75
00:07:00,953 --> 00:07:04,025
And it went around Hollywood for three years.

76
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:07,367
The one guy who thought that the script was interesting
was Bob Shaye.

77
00:07:07,427 --> 00:07:15,403
Freddy came along after 10 or 15 years and we had had
some successes before "Nightmare on Elm Street."

78
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:20,178
We had made 3 or 4 films before that, small films, all of which

79
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:24,847
we were able to sell and make our money back,
but none of which did particularly well.

80
00:07:24,911 --> 00:07:31,886
I always did think that producers had something to offer besides
raising money. And I didn't get into this business because

81
00:07:31,951 --> 00:07:33,624
I wanted to make a lot of money, I got into the business

82
00:07:33,686 --> 00:07:35,461
because I wanted to entertain people.

83
00:07:35,521 --> 00:07:41,938
When he started the company, which was 1968,
originally it was not a production company, it was

84
00:07:41,994 --> 00:07:43,632
a distribution company.

85
00:07:43,696 --> 00:07:51,410
New Line Cinema at that time was a small, tiny, tiny company,
I think a few people out of a storefront in the Lower East Side.

86
00:07:51,471 --> 00:07:57,911
Bob was a copyright lawyer and the way Bob
started New Line was that he discovered that the copyright on

87
00:07:57,977 --> 00:08:00,457
"Reefer Madness" had expired and he picked it up.

88
00:08:00,513 --> 00:08:03,084
When I came to him he had just gotten

89
00:08:03,149 --> 00:08:05,652
"Pink Flamingos" and it proved to be a big hit.

90
00:08:05,718 --> 00:08:10,064
I think he would carry it around in the trunk of his car
and show it at midnight shows.

91
00:08:10,156 --> 00:08:17,040
They would distribute them in 16 mm to army bases
and prisons and colleges. Those were their three venues.

92
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,576
That was the very, very, very beginning of New Line
as a distribution company.

93
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:25,445
There was a lot of blood, sweat and toil that went into
the whole process over 40 years.

94
00:08:25,538 --> 00:08:27,950
To everyone's credit that worked there

95
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:33,285
they worked as hard as they could for something
they loved because it certainly wasn't for money.

96
00:08:33,379 --> 00:08:38,021
It was rough, it was rough.
There were times we couldn't cash our paychecks.

97
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,257
We'd go down to the bank and they'd go,
"You can't do this," you know.

98
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:48,033
One of the guys said, "You know, we know the youth market
so well that if we could come up with a low budget horror film,

99
00:08:48,094 --> 00:08:48,765
we could really make money."

100
00:08:48,861 --> 00:08:52,900
"Nightmare on Elm Street" came to Bob Shaye,
he read it and liked it very much.

101
00:08:52,965 --> 00:08:54,638
He immediately knew there was a premise there

102
00:08:54,734 --> 00:08:56,042
that was strong and original.

103
00:08:56,102 --> 00:09:01,916
And I thought it was incredibly inspired because it had this
great marketing hook that was a familiarity

104
00:09:01,974 --> 00:09:06,184
to the entire world,
because we’ve all had nightmares. Everybody sleeps.

105
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:12,252
Bob is many different things, but he has
an extraordinary intelligence and he was

106
00:09:12,318 --> 00:09:14,423
able to see how that could grab an audience.

107
00:09:14,487 --> 00:09:20,836
We worked with Wes for six months, maybe even a year,
on the story - again -- with very little money.

108
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:25,740
"Nightmare" had a killer story. it's one of the two scripts
I've ever picked up and read straight through.

109
00:09:25,798 --> 00:09:30,144
It tried to be something as deep as it could be, you know,

110
00:09:30,236 --> 00:09:34,685
to get right into your soul. What's the source of fear?

111
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,118
It scared me so much, I actually didn't sleep
the night after I read it.

112
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:41,420
I don't think there's any film I've ever worked on
since then that was effective like that in terms of

113
00:09:41,514 --> 00:09:44,825
just being sheer, plain-ahead terrifying.

114
00:09:44,917 --> 00:09:51,766
Now one step closer to making "Elm Street" a reality,
the time had come to find the cast of characters:

115
00:09:51,824 --> 00:09:58,070
sympathetic victims, a resourceful heroine and
the man who would terrorize their dreams.

116
00:09:58,130 --> 00:10:00,440
We had a brilliant young casting woman,

117
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:03,173
Annette Benson, and she found everyone.

118
00:10:03,235 --> 00:10:08,184
I wanted very much to do young heroines
who didn't trip and fall down, who could fight if they had to.

119
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:13,349
"Moving angle favoring Nancy.
She's a pretty gin in a letter sweater

120
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:16,222
with an easy, athletic stride and the look
of a natural leader."

121
00:10:16,315 --> 00:10:21,958
I really feel that she's a totally different
kind of heroine and

122
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:25,696
I don't think she is interchangeable like a lot
of the girls in slasher movies.

123
00:10:25,791 --> 00:10:27,737
<i>'Heather was interesting to me because'</i>

124
00:10:27,793 --> 00:10:32,264
she embodied sort of what I was looking for,
which was a legitimate girl next door.

125
00:10:32,365 --> 00:10:37,371
A survivor girl, one of the leading, classic ingredients
of contemporary horror.

126
00:10:37,436 --> 00:10:39,814
Heather probably being the leading example.

127
00:10:39,872 --> 00:10:44,218
I never felt like, "Oh gosh, I really need to take
a lot of time

128
00:10:44,276 --> 00:10:46,256
and develop a character.

129
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:48,314
I really felt like I was going to bring myself to the set

130
00:10:48,381 --> 00:10:49,655
and be as close to me as I could.

131
00:10:49,749 --> 00:10:55,791
I think Freddy considered her a worthy adversary,
but she also has to be the one to go.

132
00:10:55,855 --> 00:10:59,962
She's like his penultimate, if not ultimate, challenge.

133
00:11:00,026 --> 00:11:03,371
As hard as Nancy tries, the only life
she can really save is her own.

134
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:08,344
And I think that that's actually kind of a very
tragic part of Nancy's character

135
00:11:08,401 --> 00:11:11,405
is that as hard as she tries, she isn't that successful.

136
00:11:11,537 --> 00:11:17,078
"Tina Gray, a strong girl of fifteen in a thin night shift,
moves toward us

137
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:18,588
down a dark corridor."

138
00:11:18,644 --> 00:11:23,753
I did find the character Tina when I read it,
there was something intrinsically sad about her because

139
00:11:23,816 --> 00:11:25,318
she as sort of a victim

140
00:11:25,384 --> 00:11:26,556
of this broken home and

141
00:11:26,619 --> 00:11:28,030
she's left to really raise herself.

142
00:11:28,087 --> 00:11:32,399
Tina's experience <i>was,</i> "I want to feel good
and sort of escape

143
00:11:32,458 --> 00:11:35,996
this life that I have," but I don't think Tina's character was

144
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:36,506
much of a survivor.

145
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:43,774
"''Tina turns to Nancy, but before either can say more,
Rod Lane, a lean, Richard Gere sort in black leather interrupts.

146
00:11:43,869 --> 00:11:49,319
I was pretending to be Italian.
My agent at the time gave me a name

147
00:11:49,375 --> 00:11:50,615
called Nick Carri.

148
00:11:50,676 --> 00:11:53,418
It was taboo. No Latin actor was going to make it.

149
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:56,119
"Hey, up yours with a twirling mower."

150
00:11:56,182 --> 00:12:02,224
Just, there was a lot of me in it, a lot of me:
cocky, big ego, womanizer.

151
00:12:02,288 --> 00:12:08,671
We weren't really typecast, but our essence of
who we are really was displayed in those characters

152
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:12,835
and I think that's why all of us were very successful
in portraying that group of teenagers.

153
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:14,104
<i>'(spooky sound)'</i>

154
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,477
The character of Glen was kind of the romantic

155
00:12:17,570 --> 00:12:21,706
lead in a sense. He was the heroine's boyfriend.

156
00:12:21,707 --> 00:12:26,588
We were looking at all the standard Hollywood guys,
but I didn't see anybody that seemed to be

157
00:12:26,645 --> 00:12:27,851
that really charismatic.

158
00:12:27,913 --> 00:12:31,918
Charlie Sheen wanted the role but he wanted $3000 bucks
a week and we didn't have it.

159
00:12:32,017 --> 00:12:33,894
Johnny hadn't done any acting, I don't think.

160
00:12:33,986 --> 00:12:35,556
He was in a band.

161
00:12:35,621 --> 00:12:40,366
I remember Wes saying that it was between
Johnny and one other guy.

162
00:12:40,459 --> 00:12:46,307
My daughter said, "Dad, Johnny Depp." I said, "Really?
But he looks kind of sickly and pale."

163
00:12:46,365 --> 00:12:48,538
She <i>says,</i> "He's beautiful."
(laughing) And that was it.

164
00:12:48,634 --> 00:12:53,447
The role of Johnny's was supposed to be a jock,

165
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:56,282
some white dude, big muscular guy.

166
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:59,652
Johnny comes in with a little baby voice, really sensitive.

167
00:12:59,745 --> 00:13:02,487
<i>(laughing)</i> "Did <i>you see his face?"
(mocking)</i> "Did <i>you see his face?"</i>

168
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:07,587
But he really went for the straight-laced.
He did everything he could do to be that wholesome guy.

169
00:13:07,653 --> 00:13:10,099
I thought he was really successful in it.

170
00:13:10,156 --> 00:13:13,694
Johnny was so terrified when he was first performing.

171
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:17,036
He would always be in sort of a cold,
clammy sweat and his hands would be trembling.

172
00:13:17,096 --> 00:13:21,738
He was really pushing himself, you know,
into an area that was totally different and

173
00:13:21,801 --> 00:13:23,576
I don't think, something that he felt prepared for at all.

174
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:25,979
He had an energy level that

175
00:13:26,038 --> 00:13:31,818
just a lot of actors don't have and I think
that's why he's become such a superstar.

176
00:13:31,877 --> 00:13:35,825
He's always been very sweet about
acknowledging that I gave him a start

177
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:39,260
and I think on "Actor's Studio" I've heard that he
has a nice comment about

178
00:13:39,318 --> 00:13:40,797
"Nightmare on Elm Street."

179
00:13:40,853 --> 00:13:44,198
What was your role in "Nightmare on Elm Street?"
(laughing) I played Glen.

180
00:13:44,256 --> 00:13:45,496
And what happened to Glen?

181
00:13:45,558 --> 00:13:50,007
<i>I get sucked into bed. (audience laughter)
Not</i> a <i>bad gig, you</i> know.

182
00:13:50,129 --> 00:13:53,076
It's interesting the people you get to work with
on lower budget films

183
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:55,305
because a lot of them have quite distinguished careers

184
00:13:55,367 --> 00:13:59,543
and then their careers have maybe gone down a little bit
and they don't get that much work.

185
00:13:59,605 --> 00:14:04,987
So, you can get somebody that's affordable and
at the same time has fantastic experience and chops.

186
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:07,887
Whether it's Lieutenant Fuller

187
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:09,290
in "Black Christmas"

188
00:14:09,381 --> 00:14:11,292
to Lieutenant Thompson,

189
00:14:11,350 --> 00:14:14,888
I guess I made a bridge between the two in some way.

190
00:14:15,020 --> 00:14:15,998
He's worked with everybody

191
00:14:16,055 --> 00:14:18,228
I mean, John Saxon is the man.

192
00:14:18,290 --> 00:14:19,200
You know, you realize

193
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:21,295
this guy's a legend and he can act and he's awesome.

194
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:25,034
It's funny, he arrived at the first makeup
session with two little boxes

195
00:14:25,097 --> 00:14:28,442
and he opened them up and there were hairpieces.
I don't think he'll mind me telling this story.

196
00:14:28,500 --> 00:14:33,006
He said, "Would you like this one, it's a little bit more full,
or this one, I look a little bit more aged."

197
00:14:33,105 --> 00:14:36,643
I think it's kind of rare in horror movies that the heroine has

198
00:14:36,709 --> 00:14:38,211
so many different

199
00:14:38,277 --> 00:14:40,723
relationships going through the plotlines.

200
00:14:40,813 --> 00:14:48,163
We all clicked and that's part of his genius is picking the right
people that had chemistry, that he clearly saw had chemistry.

201
00:14:48,254 --> 00:14:53,897
We would have serious discussions with Wes about,
"Look, we don't want this to be another "Friday the 13th"

202
00:14:53,959 --> 00:14:55,404
where it's just we're camping and

203
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,030
then a knife goes through the bed

204
00:14:57,229 --> 00:14:58,640
and it's, "uhhh uhhh." (knife sound)

205
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:01,712
Let's really make it psychologically damaging and real

206
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,939
and that's what the movie ultimately became.

207
00:15:04,069 --> 00:15:09,951
Freddy's origins, they're sort of multi-various and they all
come together with this character. One <i>was,</i> there was this kid

208
00:15:10,042 --> 00:15:12,613
named Freddy in elementary school

209
00:15:12,678 --> 00:15:15,181
(laughing) and he would beat me up with some regularity.

210
00:15:15,247 --> 00:15:20,492
So the name Fred/Freddy to me was like one of those
names that just brings up all these bad memories.

211
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:24,033
And then there was this incident of myself as a child

212
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,433
lying in bed at night and I heard this mumbling

213
00:15:26,492 --> 00:15:30,565
and couldn't figure out what the hell it was, you know.
So I crept to the window and there was

214
00:15:30,629 --> 00:15:34,304
this man who, if you would say,
"Oh, put Freddy down the street,"

215
00:15:34,366 --> 00:15:35,845
that's what he would look like, you know.

216
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:40,714
Somehow he sensed that somebody was watching
and he looked right up into my eyes

217
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:45,277
and l jumped back in the room and sat on the
edge of the bed waiting for him to go away

218
00:15:45,377 --> 00:15:49,154
and I went back and he was still there and he just
went and then he started walking.

219
00:15:49,248 --> 00:15:54,960
The thing that struck me most about that particular man
was that he had a lot of malice in his face and

220
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:58,058
he also had this sort of sick sense of humor

221
00:15:58,123 --> 00:16:01,969
about how delightful it was to terrify a child.

222
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:06,772
The way most villains are cast in these kinds of movies
are usually stuntmen.

223
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:13,613
Wes' idea was to get a real actor in the role
to add some personality and some elan to it.

224
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,617
I was casting for an old man

225
00:16:15,674 --> 00:16:20,316
because that's how Freddy was written.
When I was reading older men, there was a softness to them,

226
00:16:20,446 --> 00:16:22,050
there was something about having seen,

227
00:16:22,114 --> 00:16:27,757
I think, so much of life, there was a tenderness
to them (laughing) as far as they couldn't really be evil.

228
00:16:27,853 --> 00:16:30,333
David Warner was origin ally cast as Freddy

229
00:16:30,489 --> 00:16:33,698
and I was excited because I saw "Afier Time."

230
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,069
I loved him as the villain and I was kind of excited about
working with him and then

231
00:16:36,128 --> 00:16:42,568
at the last minute he said he had a prior commitment
that he couldn’t commit to their timeframe and all that,

232
00:16:42,634 --> 00:16:43,578
and that's when Robert came in.

233
00:16:43,635 --> 00:16:51,577
I was really sort of self-preoccupied with my first
boom of success <i>as</i> a result of

234
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:53,020
the miniseries

235
00:16:53,112 --> 00:16:56,685
My agent had suggested this film called
"A Nightmare on Elm Street"

236
00:16:56,782 --> 00:17:01,094
with this guy Wes Craven, and I went on this interview

237
00:17:01,153 --> 00:17:03,827
expecting to meet the prince of darkness and there was

238
00:17:03,922 --> 00:17:08,098
erudite, tall, preppy, Ralph Lauren-attired Wes Craven there.

239
00:17:08,193 --> 00:17:10,332
He looked kind of semi-geeky

240
00:17:10,429 --> 00:17:13,000
and he was much younger than I was looking for.

241
00:17:13,065 --> 00:17:14,840
I saw him coming and it was like

242
00:17:14,900 --> 00:17:19,042
"They want him to play Freddy?"
He just didn't look it, he was kind of happy-go-lucky.

243
00:17:19,104 --> 00:17:22,176
Wes is very kind to me

244
00:17:22,241 --> 00:17:25,984
and says that he saw something in me.
And perhaps he did. I hope that's the truth.

245
00:17:26,078 --> 00:17:27,614
He just relished being evil

246
00:17:27,713 --> 00:17:30,421
and it brought out that wonderful thing about Freddy

247
00:17:30,482 --> 00:17:33,156
of, it's the guy on the sidewalk frightening the kid,

248
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,698
but he was also was able to do it in almost a funny way.

249
00:17:35,754 --> 00:17:38,758
Robert created the character, he created a real, real character.

250
00:17:38,824 --> 00:17:43,739
So everyone was thrilled because Robert brought
much more to the table than a guy in a hockey mask.

251
00:17:43,829 --> 00:17:47,242
The rest was makeup and once the makeup was on
you didn't know how old he was anyway.

252
00:17:47,332 --> 00:17:49,608
(laughing) It was like, "Duh, what was I thinking?"

253
00:17:49,701 --> 00:17:51,772
David Miller

254
00:17:51,837 --> 00:17:53,942
was of "Thriller" with John Landis,

255
00:17:54,006 --> 00:17:57,920
so I knew I was in good hands because that
was the state-of-the-an phenomenon.

256
00:17:58,010 --> 00:18:01,423
The final design for Freddy was based on pepperoni pizza.

257
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:06,656
I was at a restaurant one night and I was having pizza
and I was just kind of deep in thought.

258
00:18:06,752 --> 00:18:09,790
I started playing around with the cheese,

259
00:18:09,855 --> 00:18:12,335
putting it around the pepperoni and I actually
made Freddy's face on the pizza.

260
00:18:12,424 --> 00:18:16,895
David just whipped open this medical textbook for me

261
00:18:16,962 --> 00:18:18,339
the first day I sat down

262
00:18:18,497 --> 00:18:21,501
and he said, "This is what we're going to do to you."

263
00:18:21,600 --> 00:18:23,375
And it was real burn victims.

264
00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:26,507
It's hard to imagine that Robert alone could have
the patience for someone

265
00:18:26,605 --> 00:18:30,849
touching his face like that all the time.
Always touching, always prodding.

266
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:35,654
A lot of what I discovered that I used for the
entire experience of playing Freddy

267
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:40,218
was those first few makeup applications

268
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:42,731
in David Millers garage somewhere,

269
00:18:42,788 --> 00:18:44,790
teasing him or telling him to get a brush out of my eye.

270
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,099
(menacing) "David!"
I found a little bit of Freddy in there.

271
00:18:48,193 --> 00:18:51,367
When Robert was done with the day,
as soon as they yelled "Cut!"

272
00:18:51,430 --> 00:18:54,673
he would start ripping it to pieces and throw them behind him

273
00:18:54,733 --> 00:18:59,580
as he would walk to the makeup room for me to take
the makeup off, and by the time

274
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:03,415
he would get there, half his makeup was off already,
and there would be people behind him

275
00:19:03,475 --> 00:19:07,082
with plastic bags picking up the pieces,

276
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:08,750
(laughing) and they'd come to me later on and say,

277
00:19:08,814 --> 00:19:10,054
(laughing) "What pan do I have?"

278
00:19:10,149 --> 00:19:13,562
He came up with a lot more physicality, you know,

279
00:19:13,652 --> 00:19:15,689
the way he was moving the claws and everything

280
00:19:15,754 --> 00:19:16,858
that were very original and distinctive.

281
00:19:16,922 --> 00:19:19,459
I really made conscious choices

282
00:19:19,525 --> 00:19:22,870
I recognized how great the silhouette was

283
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:27,035
and how great the shadow was.
And so I really physicalized him a lot.

284
00:19:27,099 --> 00:19:28,908
I used Klaus Kinski but I also used a little bit

285
00:19:29,001 --> 00:19:31,538
of Jimmy Cagney in there,

286
00:19:31,603 --> 00:19:37,212
that little spread-legged, strong gangster stance that
Cagney uses, was something I kind of had

287
00:19:37,276 --> 00:19:38,277
going on in the back of my head, too.

288
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:42,621
A lot of the monsters of past were misunderstood,

289
00:19:42,681 --> 00:19:44,422
they were kind of innocent.

290
00:19:44,483 --> 00:19:47,089
But Freddy Krueger is not innocent.

291
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:49,928
The real fact of Freddy that nobody really talks about,

292
00:19:50,022 --> 00:19:53,299
I think it was that Freddy molested the kids,
but they really kind of...

293
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:54,496
side-stepped that.

294
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:57,473
While we were filming the original film,
there was this

295
00:19:57,529 --> 00:20:00,874
huge national news story.

296
00:20:00,966 --> 00:20:07,576
The McMartin trial was going on endlessly. A school for children
where the children had accused teachers of molesting them,

297
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:08,583
on a very systematic way.

298
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:12,486
We had to salt-pedal the sexuality a little bit,
but that was probably even better

299
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,957
because it becomes subtext.

300
00:20:16,048 --> 00:20:23,330
That's a character entire modus operandi is about
the fact that he knows the fear he's causing you, he knows

301
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,231
that he's screwing with you before the kill.

302
00:20:25,324 --> 00:20:31,434
He could kill you right away, that's not the point.
The fun is in prolonging it. It's the foreplay, in Freddy's case.

303
00:20:31,496 --> 00:20:35,808
Freddy's in those teenage girls' bedrooms,

304
00:20:35,901 --> 00:20:38,711
he's in their bed with them,

305
00:20:38,770 --> 00:20:43,651
he's in their dreams with them, and that's about
as much as you could ever hope to violate anyone.

306
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:48,742
That's more of a violation than rape and so I think that, in and of
itself, is one of the great hooks to "A Nightmare on Elm Street."

307
00:20:53,885 --> 00:20:58,061
You know, in my mind, the killer of children
is about the most despicable

308
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,033
thing you can think and the most,

309
00:20:59,157 --> 00:21:02,001
the deepest and most profound betrayal
of the innocence of a child.

310
00:21:02,060 --> 00:21:10,844
But at the same time, there was something deeper in the original
about morality play with Freddy being a child molester

311
00:21:10,902 --> 00:21:13,348
and the whole town having their dirty secret

312
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,078
that they had committed murder,

313
00:21:15,140 --> 00:21:16,118
group murder, themselves.

314
00:21:16,208 --> 00:21:21,487
And it also made the moral issue of if it's a really
despicable human being, do you have the right

315
00:21:21,546 --> 00:21:22,650
to take the law into your hands.

316
00:21:22,714 --> 00:21:31,634
It is this story that makes you search your own soul about
vigilante justice and decent people doing bad things

317
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:33,363
in the name of what they consider justice.

318
00:21:33,458 --> 00:21:36,735
Two wrongs don't make a right and,
certainly, being burned alive is not

319
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,139
<i>'due process..</i>

320
00:21:39,197 --> 00:21:42,838
Oh, I do think that vigilante justice is an answer
to someone like Freddy Krueger.

321
00:21:42,968 --> 00:21:47,246
I would never want that kind of crime on my hands, but

322
00:21:47,306 --> 00:21:49,411
it happens, it happens all the time.

323
00:21:49,508 --> 00:21:54,548
Freddy is a warning. He is talked about and
he's whispered about.

324
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:58,457
The spectre has infiltrated their imaginations.

325
00:21:58,583 --> 00:22:05,262
I love the idea that behind one of those garage doors,
in a white trash neighborhood, Fred Krueger was there

326
00:22:05,324 --> 00:22:07,804
with his vise making that thing...

327
00:22:07,859 --> 00:22:10,738
and dreaming and fantasizing about
what he was going to do and

328
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,572
when he put it on it emboldened him.

329
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:17,011
There was a lot of killers with masks and with
some sort of an edged weapon.

330
00:22:17,102 --> 00:22:20,845
Wes was sort of stuck on what the weapon was going to be.

331
00:22:20,939 --> 00:22:25,649
What's the earliest weapon that mankind
might have been afraid of?

332
00:22:25,711 --> 00:22:27,384
And it would be, well, the weapon of an animal.

333
00:22:27,446 --> 00:22:29,687
The cave bear, you know, something that could
reach around the comer

334
00:22:29,748 --> 00:22:30,726
with these big giant claws.

335
00:22:30,816 --> 00:22:34,286
And he described it as something like "long fingernails,"

336
00:22:34,353 --> 00:22:36,094
<i>so</i> I <i>went off and did some sketches</i>

337
00:22:36,154 --> 00:22:39,067
and actually built the test fingers,
how the glove might look and function.

338
00:22:39,157 --> 00:22:44,197
Reading that script and knowing that I had to build that glove,

339
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:48,711
I felt I was just building this character
that was part of the film.

340
00:22:48,800 --> 00:22:51,076
The claw extends Freddy,

341
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:54,777
it extends his evil, it extends his anger.

342
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,183
Freddy made it in the basement,

343
00:22:56,274 --> 00:22:59,483
so the glove had to actually be kind of crude.

344
00:22:59,544 --> 00:23:04,994
It almost looks like a junior high
school shop project from hell.

345
00:23:05,183 --> 00:23:11,464
I think in those boiler room scenes he's the scariest,
'cause he was always scratching those nails against the pipes.

346
00:23:11,523 --> 00:23:13,400
He would really do that and annoy everybody.

347
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:14,436
<i>'(nails scratching)'</i>

348
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:15,527
Aaahhh!

349
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:19,369
How the glove affected me <i>was,</i>
it's heavy, and when I put it on

350
00:23:19,464 --> 00:23:23,378
one shoulder dropped a bit and it affected my movement

351
00:23:23,435 --> 00:23:26,575
and it affected my posture, and I immediately thought,

352
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:28,208
it's like a holster, it's like a gunslinger's thing.

353
00:23:28,273 --> 00:23:31,743
So that posture became signature

354
00:23:31,810 --> 00:23:32,811
for Freddy Krueger.

355
00:23:32,878 --> 00:23:36,018
When I first meet Freddy head-on in the alley

356
00:23:36,081 --> 00:23:38,618
we shot that in the middle of the night in Venice, California

357
00:23:38,717 --> 00:23:39,991
it was freezing.

358
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,827
Freddy was coming down the alleyway

359
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,993
and his arms were extending.

360
00:23:45,090 --> 00:23:47,798
That was all simple marionetting,

361
00:23:47,859 --> 00:23:51,033
where you've got guys on the garage roofs

362
00:23:51,096 --> 00:23:52,632
with long versions of fishing poles,

363
00:23:52,731 --> 00:23:55,007
with wire holding up the Freddy arms.

364
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:56,875
It looked ridiculous.

365
00:23:56,968 --> 00:23:59,642
Jacques hated this thing and with good reason.

366
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:06,519
I was a little concerned that it was going to look too fake,
too cheesy, not scary enough.

367
00:24:06,611 --> 00:24:08,022
I was surprised...

368
00:24:08,079 --> 00:24:11,959
at how well it came out in terms of people accepting it.

369
00:24:12,050 --> 00:24:14,223
The death of Tina

370
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,232
is pretty brutal stuff, I mean, it really holds up.

371
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:19,633
It appeared to be a little bit of a red herring because
you almost kind of think...

372
00:24:19,724 --> 00:24:23,001
Tina's going to be the heroine at the beginning, in a way.

373
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,268
That's the real nod to Hitchcock.

374
00:24:25,363 --> 00:24:31,575
Since Wes wanted something really big and fantastic
and out there for the first death, Tina's death,

375
00:24:31,636 --> 00:24:33,115
I suggested that we do a rotating room.

376
00:24:33,205 --> 00:24:34,707
They took it from Fred Astaire

377
00:24:34,806 --> 00:24:37,218
dancing on the walls and the roof.

378
00:24:37,309 --> 00:24:40,552
And that situation was quite a hairy situation,

379
00:24:40,612 --> 00:24:41,750
that scene where she's dragged up the wall,

380
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:44,953
there were no wires or anything dragging her,
we were rotating the entire set.

381
00:24:45,016 --> 00:24:47,792
<i>Everything in the room was naked down,'</i>

382
00:24:47,853 --> 00:24:52,302
the cameraman was in like an
airplane seat attached to the wall.

383
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:54,530
It would take a couple of people

384
00:24:54,593 --> 00:24:56,595
to just turn that room

385
00:24:56,661 --> 00:24:58,766
and actually make it move without

386
00:24:58,830 --> 00:25:00,969
using any mechanical means.

387
00:25:01,099 --> 00:25:04,740
As you get turned upside down,
you're still operating the camera,

388
00:25:04,803 --> 00:25:06,407
but you're brain is upside down.

389
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:10,476
I was either crawling or being dragged,

390
00:25:10,542 --> 00:25:11,850
however I was always on the ï¬‚oor.

391
00:25:11,943 --> 00:25:14,549
Boy, did she ever do that
that moment when she's killed

392
00:25:14,613 --> 00:25:16,320
she just nailed it.

393
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:20,260
The blood and her being dragged
up the walls and down walls,

394
00:25:20,318 --> 00:25:23,162
a brutal sequence.

395
00:25:23,255 --> 00:25:29,763
It was extremely disorienting. I know at the end of the take,
she stood up and she said, "I can't move."

396
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:32,399
I had the sensation I was falling

397
00:25:32,464 --> 00:25:35,877
and I completely ï¬‚ipped out. It was like,
"Stop, I have to get out! I have to get out!"

398
00:25:35,934 --> 00:25:39,381
And then here comes Wes, all calm,
sticking his up through the window.

399
00:25:39,437 --> 00:25:42,179
He's like, "Check this out, I'm standing on the ground,

400
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:46,916
you're laying here, we're looking at each other, you're not
falling." (laughing) It's like, "onnnn!"

401
00:25:47,012 --> 00:25:51,085
As I looked around thinking I was going to reassure her,
I started feeling nauseated.

402
00:25:51,149 --> 00:25:53,151
It was a very, very strange set.

403
00:25:53,218 --> 00:25:58,031
I remember that when the stuntwoman slammed
onto the bed, blood slapped me on the face.

404
00:25:58,089 --> 00:26:01,798
There was this beautiful, sort of slow-motion
(blood splashing sound)

405
00:26:01,860 --> 00:26:06,639
because we had the bed just loaded with blood.
And the censors, the censors

406
00:26:06,698 --> 00:26:08,769
went after that whole scene.
As soon as she hit the bed,

407
00:26:08,833 --> 00:26:11,279
we were not allowed to show any splash whatsoever.

408
00:26:11,336 --> 00:26:16,684
There was nothing fake in the first one. We were all there
in the same room, we were all acting together.

409
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:21,713
The reality of it being really there with the actor
makes such a difference in their performance.

410
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:23,350
The fact that we do the stuff live

411
00:26:23,448 --> 00:26:27,396
and that we do it on camera and we get it in one take
or two takes, or whatever,

412
00:26:27,452 --> 00:26:30,296
is pan of the romance of the genre.

413
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:33,562
In the high school scene Where I'm sitting in the class,

414
00:26:33,625 --> 00:26:34,933
we had a lot of extras there.

415
00:26:34,993 --> 00:26:39,305
It's the first time that Heather
is really confronted with the dream.

416
00:26:39,431 --> 00:26:44,107
Lin Sh aye is the sister of the producer, so she had
this really important part as the teacher.

417
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:48,708
I gotta say, I was somewhat shocked how much impact

418
00:26:48,773 --> 00:26:49,717
the English teacher

419
00:26:49,808 --> 00:26:53,881
had on people. That they remembered her and,
"I have a teacherjust like that."

420
00:26:53,945 --> 00:26:58,553
And then the strange reading of "Hamlet,"
which is <i>so Wes,</i> you know,

421
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,790
to have some classic Shakespeare reference on top of that.

422
00:27:00,852 --> 00:27:07,098
I read it straight, and then Wes came up and asked me if I'd
repeat it again in a stage whisper.

423
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:09,433
<i>(whispering) "Bad dreams."</i>

424
00:27:09,561 --> 00:27:15,637
When "Cut!" was called, people started kind of laughing
and then I received a standing ovation.

425
00:27:15,767 --> 00:27:17,906
Wes and I, we always had a joke.

426
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:22,440
I'm like, "Try to explain this to me, Wes,"
and he's like, "I can't explain it, it's just a dream."

427
00:27:22,540 --> 00:27:24,850
And I'm like, "Okay, thank you." (laughing)

428
00:27:24,909 --> 00:27:26,855
The image of the body bag

429
00:27:26,945 --> 00:27:28,947
just in the hallway, scared me so much.

430
00:27:29,047 --> 00:27:33,655
First of all, your psyche does not want
to be in a bodybag when you're alive.

431
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:38,633
Your body and your brain says, "Don't let them zip this up,"
because there's not a zipper on the in side

432
00:27:38,690 --> 00:27:41,034
so you're really at the mercy of the people

433
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:41,934
taking care of you.

434
00:27:41,993 --> 00:27:47,238
My heart was going out to Amanda because she
had to do the grossest things.

435
00:27:47,298 --> 00:27:49,574
There were eels and centipedes and

436
00:27:49,634 --> 00:27:53,639
it was very disturbing and I was upset. Both Heather and I
were very upset while we were filming those scenes.

437
00:27:53,705 --> 00:27:56,242
And she's always such a trouper

438
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:57,615
and they always kind of push the envelope
to see how much she would do.

439
00:27:57,709 --> 00:28:00,280
And then, finally, she would say,
"Okay, three centipedes... that's enough

440
00:28:00,345 --> 00:28:03,622
The hall pass line is, of course,

441
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:05,355
became a favorite of people's, actually.

442
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,088
"Where's your pass?"

443
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,630
"Screw your pass!"

444
00:28:08,753 --> 00:28:17,730
With Robert's voice coming out of my mouth, I guess kids
didn't expect it and it just really grossed them out.

445
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:20,606
"No running in the hallway."

446
00:28:20,665 --> 00:28:23,236
It's an archetype that Wes just tapped into,

447
00:28:23,334 --> 00:28:27,043
even the clothes that he wears, the stripes.

448
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:31,679
And the red and the green together
actually were from an article on how

449
00:28:31,743 --> 00:28:34,383
the eye and the retina deal with color and those two colors

450
00:28:34,446 --> 00:28:38,451
were very diff cult for the eye to see side by side. So I <i>said,
</i> "Great, that will be the stripes of the sweater." (laughing)

451
00:28:38,516 --> 00:28:43,158
So I, literally, made him into a sort of painful optical effect.

452
00:28:43,254 --> 00:28:46,360
There was a lot of pressure on the original film, I think,
because...

453
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:48,028
there was no money.

454
00:28:48,126 --> 00:28:51,471
There were tensions between Bob and Wes,
and it was obvious to everybody.

455
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:55,943
And I knew that Bob had mortgaged his company
and his life and his house and everything

456
00:28:56,000 --> 00:29:02,747
to create this film. And I knew that Wes had signed away
the rights to the characters and all this to create this film.

457
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:04,650
Wes and I had a little bit of a disagreement

458
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:08,088
about who was doing what,
and he wanted me to stick in my role as a producer.

459
00:29:08,146 --> 00:29:13,357
You've got two strong personalities,
both ofvimich shared a vision of the end

460
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:16,422
but they might not have shared every day

461
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:17,660
the vision of how to get there.

462
00:29:17,756 --> 00:29:22,227
One of the big fights I remember between Bob and Wes
was over the sticky stairs.

463
00:29:22,293 --> 00:29:24,364
<i>'Bob was obsessed with this image and Wes'</i>

464
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:26,170
wasn't particulany interested in it.

465
00:29:26,264 --> 00:29:30,041
The Bob Shaye imprint in large measure came
from some of my own nightmares

466
00:29:30,135 --> 00:29:34,379
that's why I was just
offering them up to Wes. (laughing)

467
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:37,578
I don't know if it was in the script, but they decided to have

468
00:29:37,642 --> 00:29:38,586
the carpet just cut

469
00:29:38,676 --> 00:29:42,818
and then they poured in a bunch of oatmeal mixed with
mushroom soup or something like that.

470
00:29:42,881 --> 00:29:44,292
<i>'K was Bisquick'</i>

471
00:29:44,382 --> 00:29:51,266
If you mix Bisquick up too thick and you let it sit
for about an hour, it becomes the most sticky, gooey,

472
00:29:51,356 --> 00:29:53,495
tenacious stuff on the planet.

473
00:29:53,591 --> 00:30:01,237
Wes fin ally deigned to let me say "Action!" at least.
(laughing) There wasn't very much directing to go on.

474
00:30:01,299 --> 00:30:06,977
Letting him "direct," call "Action!" and "Cut!" on that,
was kind of a way of saying, "Come on, we're friends,"

475
00:30:07,038 --> 00:30:09,018
and you know, "We're in this together."

476
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:13,453
You know, ultimately, I think Bob and I both respected
each other all the way through and we both knew

477
00:30:13,511 --> 00:30:16,151
we had everything to win or lose with the film.

478
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:18,888
We had 80 effects, shots

479
00:30:18,950 --> 00:30:20,088
OI' SEQUEHCES

480
00:30:20,151 --> 00:30:21,789
in a 90-minute film

481
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:23,628
that we were shooting in 26 days.

482
00:30:23,688 --> 00:30:24,792
Poor Heather's been haunted by

483
00:30:24,856 --> 00:30:27,359
phallic moments, you know. (laughing)
The first one with Freddy coming out of the bathtub

484
00:30:27,425 --> 00:30:28,631
between her legs.

485
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:35,108
They built a bathtub on our soundstage that
had no bottom and then it had, instead, a tank.

486
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,546
So I had the distinct pleasure of having
Heather Langenkamp sitting on my knees

487
00:30:39,604 --> 00:30:42,084
with her feet resting on my shoulders for an entire day.

488
00:30:42,173 --> 00:30:46,144
And he's the one who has the hand
that comes up with the Freddy glove on it.

489
00:30:46,244 --> 00:30:48,451
Rod's death scene in the jail

490
00:30:48,513 --> 00:30:50,254
was technically complicated.

491
00:30:50,348 --> 00:30:52,328
When they try to hang me, they hang me

492
00:30:52,383 --> 00:30:54,420
on fishwire, but the fishwire wasn't

493
00:30:54,485 --> 00:30:57,864
strong enough, so the first time I crashed and burned, I fell.

494
00:30:57,922 --> 00:31:00,903
There's one shot in there where it's shot in reverse

495
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,064
where the thing actually snakes around his neck.

496
00:31:03,161 --> 00:31:07,906
It was the old days, it was the way to do it, you know.
Kind of archaic, but it works.

497
00:31:07,966 --> 00:31:10,105
"I couldn't even see the fucker."

498
00:31:10,168 --> 00:31:14,241
Well the jail scene, I was really depressed.
I'm not going to say the drug I was doing,

499
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:15,716
but I was ripped.

500
00:31:15,807 --> 00:31:16,808
I was passed out

501
00:31:16,908 --> 00:31:18,888
and Wes, I think, Wes was like,
"Are you ready for this shoot?"

502
00:31:19,010 --> 00:31:21,490
I'm crying, not because of the scene,

503
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:23,616
I'm crying because my life is shitty at the time.

504
00:31:23,681 --> 00:31:28,426
I really regret that I brought a substance
and changed my acting,

505
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:31,329
but I'm clean after 25 years. I'm sober.

506
00:31:31,389 --> 00:31:34,632
What I like so much about the story,

507
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:37,263
and about Renee Blakley and John Saxon's

508
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:44,576
portrayal, is that you really don't understand at the beginning
why they have this kind of conspiratorial relationship.

509
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,012
I guess I played the role,

510
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:50,712
or it was intended to be,
someone who is harsh and a little tough.

511
00:31:50,775 --> 00:31:54,484
My relationship with my father is
the most distant and the most diff cult.

512
00:31:54,579 --> 00:31:57,651
He's not willing to go there and admit that Nancy's

513
00:31:57,749 --> 00:31:59,023
having these real dreams.

514
00:31:59,083 --> 00:32:01,154
Heather was saying things about

515
00:32:01,219 --> 00:32:02,755
"Fred Krueger"

516
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:07,269
and I'd say, "Stop that kind of stuff, this is nonsense.
Don't talk to me about that."

517
00:32:07,325 --> 00:32:12,104
Ronee Blakley's character was interesting, you know.
She's this alcoholic mother and it was important to me

518
00:32:12,196 --> 00:32:15,234
that there was this drifi from a woman who was saying

519
00:32:15,300 --> 00:32:16,540
"You're crazy," to her child.

520
00:32:16,634 --> 00:32:21,845
And she actually has the weight of the world
on her shoulders because of her crime

521
00:32:21,906 --> 00:32:23,817
in creating Freddy Krueger.

522
00:32:23,875 --> 00:32:28,756
And once she has disclosed that she and her cohorts
of the other parents have essentially caused

523
00:32:28,846 --> 00:32:30,291
the deaths of their own children,

524
00:32:30,415 --> 00:32:32,019
starts drinking heavily

525
00:32:32,083 --> 00:32:37,863
to the point where when Nancy is about to face
her worst test, her mother isn't there and has to be

526
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:38,923
kind of put to bed like a little child.

527
00:32:39,023 --> 00:32:43,301
She becomes such an important yin to my yang.

528
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:49,107
I don't think the movie would have been as good without
her being a little bit more intense than I think

529
00:32:49,167 --> 00:32:51,704
our average parent character is these days.

530
00:32:51,803 --> 00:32:53,870
Nancy comes home and there's bars on all the windows.

531
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:56,943
And then, later, when she needs to get out
of the house, she can't because

532
00:32:57,008 --> 00:32:58,544
she's locked from the inside.

533
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:00,111
And goes to her mother and the mother <i>says,</i>

534
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:02,691
"Locked, locked, locked." (laughing)

535
00:33:02,747 --> 00:33:04,249
The battle's about to be

536
00:33:04,315 --> 00:33:07,421
enjoined with Freddy and it's going
to take place in the house.

537
00:33:07,485 --> 00:33:10,898
And what her mom has done
by putting bars on is ensured that

538
00:33:10,955 --> 00:33:13,299
there will be no escape.

539
00:33:13,358 --> 00:33:18,068
I'm trying to talk to Glen and trying to wam him that,
you know, he's about to get killed by Freddy

540
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:19,472
if he falls asleep

541
00:33:19,530 --> 00:33:23,774
and I look dovm and it's Freddy's
mouth and tongue and he <i>says,</i>

542
00:33:23,835 --> 00:33:27,282
<i>"I'm your boyfriend now, Nancy."</i>

543
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,613
That shocked people so much.

544
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:31,847
It was one of the most
startling moments of the first film

545
00:33:31,909 --> 00:33:33,445
and the special effects cost $5.

546
00:33:33,544 --> 00:33:35,922
Heather unwanted to, eventually,

547
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:37,254
take that thing home

548
00:33:37,315 --> 00:33:38,589
and we thought it was a little strange.

549
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:41,390
Then the rotating room ended up getting used again

550
00:33:41,452 --> 00:33:44,058
for Johnny Depp's death,
but that wasn't originally planned that way.

551
00:33:44,155 --> 00:33:47,261
Johnny Depp went through a mattress.

552
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:51,204
(laughing) He's got his headphones on,
and all of a sudden

553
00:33:51,329 --> 00:33:54,173
The blood spilling out of the bed,

554
00:33:54,232 --> 00:33:55,711
that was a one take deal.

555
00:33:55,767 --> 00:33:56,711
Big pressure there.

556
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,476
Wes, who is now strapped to one of the camera chairs,
would say, "Go."

557
00:33:59,570 --> 00:34:03,108
We tumed the room upside down, the bed was now

558
00:34:03,174 --> 00:34:04,152
at the top.

559
00:34:04,208 --> 00:34:09,886
When they started dumping the red water, the blood,
through the thing, as soon as it hit the ceiling

560
00:34:09,947 --> 00:34:10,789
and hit the light

561
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:17,629
it immediately electrified the water,
so the guy pouring the water got electrocuted.

562
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:19,599
<i>(laughing) Oops.</i>

563
00:34:19,690 --> 00:34:23,763
You got hundreds of gallons of water
now sloshing on the ï¬‚oor.

564
00:34:23,861 --> 00:34:27,900
Which threw the weight off entirely,
and the WhOIE thing suddenlyjust shifted.

565
00:34:28,032 --> 00:34:30,911
And the room started going like this.

566
00:34:31,002 --> 00:34:33,380
That room started to turn.

567
00:34:33,438 --> 00:34:35,611
And the room got out of control from the operators.

568
00:34:35,673 --> 00:34:37,914
And there was no way we were stopping it.

569
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,511
It rolled all the way over

570
00:34:39,577 --> 00:34:41,579
because the weight of the blood
went to the wrong side of the ceiling.

571
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:44,125
And we were up there

572
00:34:44,182 --> 00:34:46,287
jumping out of the way of

573
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:48,193
cables and ropes that were ripping out.

574
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:53,099
Water went into all the lights and there were these huge
ï¬‚ashes in the dark, and we were spinning in the dark

575
00:34:53,157 --> 00:34:54,192
(laughing) with sparks going off.

576
00:34:54,292 --> 00:34:56,033
And the wall had a window in it.

577
00:34:56,094 --> 00:34:59,200
And, of course, the blood all poured out the window on us,

578
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,335
so the crew that was turning the room is
standing there completely covered in blood.

579
00:35:02,433 --> 00:35:07,678
So, the room stopped upside dovm and
we were hanging upside dovm for at least 20 minutes.

580
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:12,949
Caused Jacques to make noises that no man should
ever have to make unless he's actually dying.

581
00:35:13,044 --> 00:35:13,852
Itwas pretty funny, though.

582
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,514
<i>(laughing)</i>

583
00:35:15,646 --> 00:35:17,922
No one was hurt, we got the shot.

584
00:35:18,049 --> 00:35:21,622
It just came out so totally cool. So, pan of the reason

585
00:35:21,686 --> 00:35:22,721
that that effect looks like that

586
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:25,528
is because of this fortuitous mistake.

587
00:35:25,590 --> 00:35:27,365
I think there was a little bit more to John ny Depp's

588
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:29,734
bloody room scene.

589
00:35:29,827 --> 00:35:32,933
I guess his head was going to come out of the bed
once he gets sucked down in there

590
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:34,670
and it spits him back out.

591
00:35:34,732 --> 00:35:37,303
Actually, I remember it was pretty scary.
I don't know why it was cut.

592
00:35:37,368 --> 00:35:39,348
At a certain point, you felt like,
"Well, the scene's over."

593
00:35:39,403 --> 00:35:42,441
We did use the room again

594
00:35:42,507 --> 00:35:45,351
in "Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo."

595
00:35:45,409 --> 00:35:48,390
"Booby Traps and Improvised Anti-Personnel Devices?"

596
00:35:48,446 --> 00:35:53,259
I had read this Army manual called "Improvised Weapons"

597
00:35:53,317 --> 00:35:55,820
and it was all about how to make booby traps.

598
00:35:55,887 --> 00:36:00,666
Every one of those little gags and all those things were
things that came out of either somebody's

599
00:36:00,725 --> 00:36:02,500
imagination

600
00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:05,507
or we got from one of the books on doing booby traps.

601
00:36:05,563 --> 00:36:08,737
(laughing) There were several films that I did that had booby
traps.

602
00:36:08,799 --> 00:36:11,245
I just thought they were fun.

603
00:36:11,402 --> 00:36:13,678
After a while I just said, (laughing) "You can't have
any more booby traps, Craven."

604
00:36:13,771 --> 00:36:18,720
The whole sequence of Freddy getting lit up in the cellar-

605
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:20,881
turning, running up the stairs,

606
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:23,016
falling down, rolling back dovm the stairs -

607
00:36:23,147 --> 00:36:24,649
is all one shot.

608
00:36:24,749 --> 00:36:25,750
That was one take.

609
00:36:25,816 --> 00:36:28,092
And I wouldn't have believed that anybody

610
00:36:28,186 --> 00:36:31,793
could burn for that long and then get up and
start back up the stairs again.

611
00:36:31,889 --> 00:36:33,095
We were just standing there in awe.

612
00:36:33,191 --> 00:36:37,833
The scene where my mom gets pulled dowrn
into the bed in the fiery blaze of light,

613
00:36:37,895 --> 00:36:40,637
of all the scenes in the movie, it's the most fantastic.

614
00:36:40,698 --> 00:36:42,234
You have Freddy, you have my mother,

615
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:42,869
you have my dad, you have me,

616
00:36:42,934 --> 00:36:45,278
and nothing really makes sense at this point.

617
00:36:45,369 --> 00:36:48,316
"I take back every bit of energy I gave you."

618
00:36:48,406 --> 00:36:54,823
What the ending of the original "Nightmare on Elm Street"
means, symbolically with Nancy turning her back on Freddy, is

619
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:57,621
"I won't participate in fear."

620
00:36:57,682 --> 00:36:59,252
The fear that Freddy engenders.

621
00:36:59,350 --> 00:37:02,490
It's a very simple solution to all this mayhem.

622
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:05,397
Nancy realizes that that's how you stop it

623
00:37:05,456 --> 00:37:10,735
is not to surrender to it. So that's actually,
I think, a very satisfying ending.

624
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:18,642
It's a confusing scene because with the ending that we
now have, it doesn't quite make sense. If I turn my back and

625
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:23,982
and that was supposed to be a successful resolution, then
the fact that Freddy comes back means I failed.

626
00:37:24,075 --> 00:37:28,649
We were uncertain about the ending.
We didn't really feel like we had it right.

627
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:33,856
Wes wanted the ending to be that Heather woke up in the
morning and the sun was shining and she walked away.

628
00:37:33,951 --> 00:37:39,526
He wanted to have a big hook to the picture
so that he could have a sequel.

629
00:37:39,624 --> 00:37:43,401
And I thought he was crazy.
There will never be a sequel. Boy, was I stupid.

630
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:46,838
I've been accused of fighting for a
movie that could have sequels

631
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:48,638
but that wasn't really the case.
I just felt that

632
00:37:48,699 --> 00:37:51,771
the ending to the movie didn't send the audience out

633
00:37:51,869 --> 00:37:54,850
with any great excitement.

634
00:37:54,939 --> 00:37:56,885
He and I had lots of arguments.

635
00:37:56,974 --> 00:38:00,854
I even think my father got involved.
(laughing) They were asking his opinion.

636
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:03,118
I said, "Okay, fine I'll put them in a car

637
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,420
and we'll have the car have Freddy's stripes.

638
00:38:04,515 --> 00:38:11,364
They asked us to do three or four different versions
of different things happening surrounding the car.

639
00:38:11,489 --> 00:38:12,968
There always was this sense

640
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:14,935
that Freddy was the car.

641
00:38:15,026 --> 00:38:18,269
We ended up shooting two or three different endings.

642
00:38:18,329 --> 00:38:20,673
There was one Wnere I drive the car.

643
00:38:20,731 --> 00:38:22,039
There was one where Johnny drives the car.

644
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,512
We shot it without the top coming up,
we shot it with the top coming up.

645
00:38:25,603 --> 00:38:29,107
The irony is that we used all of the endings, just about.

646
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:34,713
But it was always Wes' idea to pan
to the little ginsjumping rope,

647
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:37,055
which is such an evocative ending.

648
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:38,889
That's the real ending and it's brilliant.

649
00:38:38,949 --> 00:38:42,897
But he did get his hook.
We kind of compromised on the hook.

650
00:38:42,953 --> 00:38:44,193
<i>(screaming)</i>

651
00:38:44,288 --> 00:38:48,862
The effect with Ronee works great on film,
but When we shot it, it was really silly shit. (laughing)

652
00:38:48,993 --> 00:38:50,631
It was just so comical looking.

653
00:38:50,728 --> 00:38:53,231
I couldn't figure out how they did it,
so I thought it was totally cool.

654
00:38:53,297 --> 00:38:57,473
We had an articulated dummy that we used
for several different things in the film,

655
00:38:57,535 --> 00:38:58,912
and so we just dressed it up as Renee.

656
00:38:58,969 --> 00:39:03,247
It had to be all very squishy 'cause he wanted it
to go through a window.

657
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:07,346
And the dummy went (swooshing)
and was sucked through the window. (laughing)

658
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:13,293
it worked well enough, there's no question about that, but,
you know, when you see it today it's a little silly. But, so what?

659
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:18,384
I felt actually very bad about doing that,
but I also felt very much that Bob was the only person

660
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:25,104
that was able to get this picture going and championed it,
so I gave him his hook.

661
00:39:25,162 --> 00:39:28,575
I look at the entire film "Nightmare on Elm Street"

662
00:39:28,799 --> 00:39:30,938
as a precognitive nightmare of Nancy.

663
00:39:31,035 --> 00:39:37,543
Everything in it will happen, but it hasn't really happened,
she's just dreamt that it's going to happen and she's trying to

664
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,678
wam everybody.
And then it begins

665
00:39:39,810 --> 00:39:40,948
at the very ending there.

666
00:39:41,078 --> 00:39:45,754
<i>(singing) "...three, four, better lock your door..."</i>

667
00:39:45,850 --> 00:39:53,598
Before I came on "Nightmare on Elm Street"
the little jump rope nursery rhyme thing had been worked out.

668
00:39:53,691 --> 00:39:56,638
(Singing) "One, two, Freddy's coming for you..."

669
00:39:56,694 --> 00:39:58,731
<i>(humming)</i>

670
00:39:58,796 --> 00:40:03,245
which was set to this little nursery rhyme that I had written,
but I had no idea of how that could be set to music.

671
00:40:03,334 --> 00:40:06,872
And I think it was Heather's boyfriend
who came up with that little rhyme.

672
00:40:06,937 --> 00:40:12,148
My boyfriend was a musician. We were just sitting
around the piano one time and he sat down

673
00:40:12,243 --> 00:40:15,622
and he just did this little minor key thing.

674
00:40:15,679 --> 00:40:22,654
And I kept that element and kind of worked it into the score
in a few places because it seemed to be important,

675
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,630
and I'm sewing the film.

676
00:40:23,721 --> 00:40:29,865
If you can get just the right musical phrase and then play it
a million different ways, and backwards and upside dovm and

677
00:40:29,927 --> 00:40:31,873
different instrumentation, it unifies the entire film.

678
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:36,138
And then I thought, "Let's have a theme.

679
00:40:36,200 --> 00:40:38,737
Let's get a melody involved here."

680
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:44,446
<i>(Playing piano)</i>

681
00:40:44,508 --> 00:40:49,508
<i>So, the melody is playing with your sense of order
(playing piano), maybe we</i> go <i>to there (playing piano),</i>

682
00:40:56,921 --> 00:40:59,697
and another note that doesn't belong (playing piano).

683
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:04,297
That theme really created the ï¬‚avor for the film.

684
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:09,538
When "ANightmare on Elm Street" was
rejected by every major Hollywood studio,

685
00:41:09,633 --> 00:41:15,743
Robert Shaye and New Line Cinema took the
ultimate gamble by releasing the film on their OWH.

686
00:41:15,806 --> 00:41:22,951
And on November 9, 1984, all eyes watched
to see if that bet would pay off.

687
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:27,517
The film could have, literally, destroyed the company,

688
00:41:27,518 --> 00:41:33,127
and, so, there was a lot of tension around
that during the release of the film.

689
00:41:33,290 --> 00:41:34,963
When the film open ed

690
00:41:35,025 --> 00:41:37,562
to see this huge line around the block on Broadway

691
00:41:37,628 --> 00:41:41,735
of people waiting to get into the theater,
then I knew that the fuse had been lit.

692
00:41:41,832 --> 00:41:46,838
I took my son, who was 12. We sat and watched it.

693
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:51,910
My <i>son nudged me and said, "Pop, this is really</i> good."
<i>And</i> I <i>said, "Yeah, I think it is, it really is."</i>

694
00:41:52,042 --> 00:41:57,583
Completely scared me. I think I was enough removed
from it that I got lost in the story.

695
00:41:57,715 --> 00:42:00,195
Even though I worked on the film,
there were parts that scared me.

696
00:42:00,317 --> 00:42:02,524
It got into your bones on some level.

697
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:07,653
That's why Wes is so good at this. He really loves to
explore the psychology of people's minds

698
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:13,467
and understands that fear is one of the
most important emotions that people have.

699
00:42:13,631 --> 00:42:18,239
The fact that "Nightmare on Elm Street" was
a critical success and a financial <i>success</i>

700
00:42:18,302 --> 00:42:21,408
helped me immensely.
When I started on the film I was penniless.

701
00:42:21,572 --> 00:42:26,681
It was the first film that made that amount of money for us.
I mean it wasnt like hundreds of millions of dollars,

702
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,448
but it was a few million anyhow.

703
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:30,253
It put New Line Cinema on the map.

704
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:39,199
To think that it was such a big financial issue that a company's
life depended on <i>less</i> than $2 million -- that's pretty amazing.

705
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:45,797
I think "Nightmare on Elm Street" put me into the big time,
so to speak. I mean, it certainly gave me recognition.

706
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:50,936
Wes became "Horror Meister" Wes Craven and
I became "Horror Star,"

707
00:42:51,001 --> 00:42:53,003
"Slasher Starâ€œ Robert Englund.

708
00:42:53,103 --> 00:42:57,779
It had already achieved a cult status
very quickly, and very shortly

709
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:00,616
after that it began to snowball.

710
00:43:00,778 --> 00:43:06,490
"1" was the real seminal movie and it still has
some really genius scenes in it.

711
00:43:06,617 --> 00:43:10,121
And I think I did some things that were really innovative

712
00:43:10,187 --> 00:43:17,628
and have had the chance to work with some enormously
talented and wonderfully spirited people.

713
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:20,141
And it doesn't get much better than that in the business.

714
00:43:33,344 --> 00:43:40,922
Aiter their first taste of mainstream success, New Line Cinema
immediately realized it was time to think about Freddy's future

715
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:42,758
and the "Nightmare" they now owned.

716
00:43:42,820 --> 00:43:48,327
I don't think that we were thinking about a sequel. Who
knew that it would even be this successful? We didn't know.

717
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:51,030
After the film opened so big on the weekend

718
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:55,543
the head of distribution went right in to Bob Shaye
and said, "We need a sequel."

719
00:43:55,633 --> 00:43:59,638
We weren't calculatedly trying to capitalize on the thing,

720
00:43:59,703 --> 00:44:05,278
we just, this was the only project we had that had sequel
potential.

721
00:44:05,342 --> 00:44:13,523
Bob Sh aye had basically leveraged his ass off on the first one.
He'd sold all the rights off to get the movie made.

722
00:44:13,684 --> 00:44:20,067
The other entity, the other financial entity, I think,
just kind of crucified him and took a lot ofvmat he had.

723
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:25,104
So that when "Nightmare on Elm Street"
the original made a healthy profit

724
00:44:25,162 --> 00:44:28,632
it wasn't really a profit that went into Bob's pockets,
nor did it really help his studio.

725
00:44:28,766 --> 00:44:33,806
What Bob came away with was a copyright on something
that could be very, very valuable.

726
00:44:33,937 --> 00:44:38,937
And New Line was always stumbling ï¬‚'om one
distribution movie to another distribution movie,

727
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:43,949
and, so, this was a chance to be able
to create a little bit of cash ï¬‚ow.

728
00:44:44,081 --> 00:44:48,291
The signal definitely was there that,
"I own this and I'm gonna do with it what I want."

729
00:44:48,419 --> 00:44:51,923
Wes didn't want this movie to be a franchise.

730
00:44:52,056 --> 00:44:55,128
I didn't want to keep going on something that
was owned by somebody else.

731
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:59,035
I don't think that there was a real conversation about
Wes doing "Nightmare 2"

732
00:44:59,229 --> 00:45:05,771
because he and Bob had such a stressed relationship.
It was a longtime before, I think, they spoke to each other.

733
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:13,720
The bone of contention really was a profit participation and
not so much about having the courtesy to offer him

734
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:14,847
to direct the next movie.

735
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:19,017
So, we ended up going to a young man, David Chaskin,

736
00:45:19,083 --> 00:45:23,554
who worked in our 16mm distribution department,
(laughing) but he had written a script that we'd

737
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:24,325
option ed because we liked it.

738
00:45:24,455 --> 00:45:28,835
I just thought that it would be fun for

739
00:45:28,892 --> 00:45:31,498
Freddy to have a human avatar

740
00:45:31,562 --> 00:45:35,669
that's actually doing stuff in the real world.
That was where I took ofifrom:

741
00:45:35,799 --> 00:45:36,504
possession.

742
00:45:36,600 --> 00:45:42,414
I thought the script was quite inferior and I had a lot of notes.
And they said, "We just want to shoot this," so off they went.

743
00:45:42,506 --> 00:45:46,318
A good friend of mine, Jack Sh older, agreed to direct the film.

744
00:45:46,443 --> 00:45:51,017
Jack Sholder had been making trailers for us
and he was very talented.

745
00:45:51,081 --> 00:45:53,561
One of our first films that we ever produced

746
00:45:53,617 --> 00:45:57,394
he directed, called "Alone in the Dark."

747
00:45:57,454 --> 00:46:04,099
Jack was pretty good technically.
He had come out of editing, so he knew how to tell stories.

748
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,732
I was never a huge fan of the original.

749
00:46:06,797 --> 00:46:09,141
I mean, I understood why it was good

750
00:46:09,199 --> 00:46:12,009
and I understood why it was successful,

751
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:18,042
but I felt no compunction to follow the template of the first film.

752
00:46:18,208 --> 00:46:23,749
I wasn't asked to do "Nightmare 2." I think that the script was
probably developed quickly aï¬‚er "Nightmare 1."

753
00:46:23,881 --> 00:46:28,523
To my knowledge, nobody ever talked about bringing
Heather Ian genkamp back

754
00:46:28,585 --> 00:46:35,332
to do "Nightmare 2" simply because I think they had
determined, at that point, to do a completely different story.

755
00:46:35,492 --> 00:46:38,530
And, you know, that house was so iconic,

756
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:41,940
that it made a lot of sense to focus on the house
and the next inhabitants of that house.

757
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,773
There was a problem with Robert

758
00:46:44,835 --> 00:46:47,213
because Robert's agent started getting wise.

759
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:50,648
I was already feeling ownership

760
00:46:50,707 --> 00:46:52,277
of Freddy by then.

761
00:46:52,442 --> 00:46:58,256
They were asking all kinds of money that we didn't have and
we were certainly in a dither about what to do.

762
00:46:58,382 --> 00:47:05,129
And Bob Shaye said, "Why do we need to have Robert
Englund? Because it's just a guy in a rubber mask."

763
00:47:05,189 --> 00:47:07,760
They didn't even know that Freddy was the franchise.

764
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:14,705
We started "Nightmare on Elm Street Part 2"
with an extra in a rubber suit and mask.

765
00:47:14,765 --> 00:47:18,008
And he was just atrocious. He would walk like a

766
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:20,048
dime store monster. He would sort of hunker around.

767
00:47:20,137 --> 00:47:21,946
Moving around like Frankenstein,

768
00:47:22,072 --> 00:47:23,050
going like this.

769
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:25,175
He was just terrible, terrible.

770
00:47:25,275 --> 00:47:29,312
Jack said to Bob, "You're a fool if you use
anybody else besides Robert."

771
00:47:29,313 --> 00:47:33,182
So, by him saying that, I think eany on,
to Bob Shaye

772
00:47:33,183 --> 00:47:33,593
I think that kind of helped me.

773
00:47:33,717 --> 00:47:37,290
It really proved to everyone that it's not just
a guy in a rubber mask.

774
00:47:37,454 --> 00:47:40,663
Casting "Nightmare 2" was

775
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:42,032
a fascinating experience.

776
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:45,902
We really were looking for the best actors, period.

777
00:47:46,063 --> 00:47:55,177
"Closer angle - the boy, about 17, four-eyes, bad skin,
lousy posture and an obvious inferiority complex."

778
00:47:55,239 --> 00:48:00,239
I was cast as Jesse in the lead role in
"Nightmare on Elm Street Pan 2"

779
00:48:01,111 --> 00:48:04,684
after auditioning for the first
"Nightmare on Elm Street" forWes Craven.

780
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:07,489
I knew who Mark Patton was from

781
00:48:07,551 --> 00:48:11,761
"Come Back to the Five & Dime, Jimmy Dean, Jimmy Dean."
I'd seen that and I just thought he was wonderful in that.

782
00:48:11,922 --> 00:48:15,426
He had a real kind of vulnerability about him that I liked.

783
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:19,463
Brad Pitt and Christian Slater also came in to read for the role

784
00:48:19,529 --> 00:48:20,701
and I had no idea who they were.

785
00:48:20,831 --> 00:48:25,280
How many famous people I actually rejected
in favor of Mark Patton.

786
00:48:25,335 --> 00:48:29,647
"Ronny Grady, a tou gh-looking wise-ass type,
steps up to the plate."

787
00:48:29,773 --> 00:48:29,805
'

788
00:48:29,806 --> 00:48:32,787
The last day of filming "Weird Science"

789
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:36,450
was the day I had an audition for "Nightmare 2."

790
00:48:36,513 --> 00:48:39,926
Robert Dovmey Jr. gave me a ride to my audition

791
00:48:39,983 --> 00:48:42,486
and Mark and I went in and we read together

792
00:48:42,552 --> 00:48:43,724
and they hired us on the spot.

793
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:49,964
Robert Rusler and I were allowed to sit in on
the casting of the girl, for the lead, for Lisa.

794
00:48:50,127 --> 00:48:57,978
"Jesse opens the front door to Lisa Poletti. Real pretty, with
an intelligence and sweetness about her. She is truly lovely."

795
00:48:58,035 --> 00:49:00,481
The bond that Mark and I had

796
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:03,108
really began from the time we met.

797
00:49:03,173 --> 00:49:05,779
There was just an easy quality in how we related.

798
00:49:05,909 --> 00:49:08,651
I just loved her from the minute I met her. She was adorable.

799
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:10,519
It was her first, you know, big break.

800
00:49:10,614 --> 00:49:17,054
We auditioned her and we cast her
simply based on her talent.

801
00:49:17,120 --> 00:49:19,726
And the fact that she looked like Meryl Streep.

802
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:27,240
"Kerry, a dizzy, Bloomingdale's-punk, steps up
alongside Lisa as the latter catches Jesse's stare."

803
00:49:27,297 --> 00:49:30,210
The reason I love this movie is that it changed my life.

804
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:32,346
I had a ticket to go back to NewYom,

805
00:49:32,469 --> 00:49:39,478
move back to New York and be done with Hollywood and
they cast me in the movie. And it was like the deciding thing

806
00:49:39,543 --> 00:49:41,386
of me staying here, and I never left.

807
00:49:41,545 --> 00:49:43,923
And then it was just off and running, it was ofiand running.

808
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:45,924
The first big gag was the scene

809
00:49:45,983 --> 00:49:49,897
when the bus is hurtling through the burnt out desert.

810
00:49:50,053 --> 00:49:52,556
Jesse was this nerdy outcast

811
00:49:52,622 --> 00:49:55,228
and Freddy is taking over

812
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:57,670
and about to take him for this ride.

813
00:49:57,728 --> 00:50:00,004
The whole movie is the ride that Freddy takes him through.

814
00:50:00,163 --> 00:50:04,873
We had this mechanical bus up on a thing
and it would tilt back and forth

815
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:06,676
and we got into the bus.

816
00:50:06,737 --> 00:50:12,710
And at, one point, there wasn't a whole lot of acting for me
going on 'cause we were getting jostled all over the place

817
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:20,194
At one point, it <i>was,</i> like, "Wham!" and I slam my nose on the fiont of the
bar and the rest of the day I was in such pain I was screaming and crying.

818
00:50:20,250 --> 00:50:22,662
Robert was very into it, which is great. You need that, you know.

819
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:25,325
It's great to feed off of. For me, I love that.

820
00:50:25,389 --> 00:50:28,393
For the first one, you didn't see anything of Freddy.

821
00:50:28,458 --> 00:50:31,064
I mean, you saw him in the shadows, he barely said a word.

822
00:50:31,128 --> 00:50:36,134
We tried to make Freddy a little more talkative.

823
00:50:36,266 --> 00:50:39,713
Freddy got more vocal, his character
got more dimensionalized.

824
00:50:39,870 --> 00:50:43,181
"We got special work to do here, you and me."

825
00:50:43,340 --> 00:50:46,287
At the time, horror movie villains --

826
00:50:46,343 --> 00:50:48,789
Jason, Michael Myers -- they didn't talk.

827
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:49,755
Freddy talked.

828
00:50:49,913 --> 00:50:52,393
He had a certain black sense of humor.

829
00:50:52,549 --> 00:50:57,294
David Miller started off doing the special makeup effects for
Freddy Krueger

830
00:50:57,354 --> 00:51:04,329
and did a brilliant job. So brilliant, I guess, that when we came
in to do the sequel, we decided to bring another guy in.

831
00:51:04,528 --> 00:51:11,969
I just didn't have time to do another "Nightmare on Elm Street." I
just finished the other one and I thought, "Okay, time to move on."

832
00:51:12,135 --> 00:51:15,582
We got another guy, Kevin Yagher,
who we'd worked with in the past.

833
00:51:15,705 --> 00:51:22,213
Dave Miller and I just spoke at the very beginning about
basically passing on the torch, passing the baton to me.

834
00:51:22,279 --> 00:51:25,886
There's a big myth that we have a big rivalry going
and all that stuff,

835
00:51:26,016 --> 00:51:29,259
'cause he stole Freddy and all that. It's not like that at all.

836
00:51:29,319 --> 00:51:30,953
They didn't know what they had

837
00:51:30,954 --> 00:51:36,063
in "Nightmare on Elm Street 1," they had no idea what kind
ofhit it was going to be, so they barely took any photographs.

838
00:51:36,126 --> 00:51:43,669
Kevin had a really hard time just trying to figure out what was going on on the face.
It was like, "What is all this? I can't figure it out."

839
00:51:43,867 --> 00:51:49,340
I wanted to give it bone structure.
I wanted to give it cheekbones and kind of make it

840
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:51,249
more like a male witch. You know, give it a hook nose.

841
00:51:51,374 --> 00:51:57,586
I had convinced Bob Shaye to change Freddy's eyes from
Robert Englund's normal green eyes to these sort of

842
00:51:57,647 --> 00:52:00,321
demonic, red and yellow/amber-colored eyes.

843
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:04,923
There was something odd about it and
it fits in fine, it actually worked.

844
00:52:04,988 --> 00:52:07,161
"What that boy needs is a good goddamn kick in the butt."

845
00:52:07,257 --> 00:52:16,177
The parents in a horror movie usually don't get to be
up front and center and doing really cool thin gs.

846
00:52:16,233 --> 00:52:18,235
They're usually in sort of reactive roles.

847
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:21,440
It's very dangerous being a male actor in motion pictures.

848
00:52:22,372 --> 00:52:24,784
As I discovered, repairing a home

849
00:52:24,875 --> 00:52:26,081
is equally dangerous.

850
00:52:28,378 --> 00:52:37,924
One of my favorite moments in Nightmare's sophisticated
mechanical effects history, was the parakeet on a stick.

851
00:52:38,054 --> 00:52:40,933
There was a scene in mmich the father

852
00:52:40,991 --> 00:52:43,028
was attacked by a bird in the living room.

853
00:52:43,093 --> 00:52:45,300
I think that was a reference to the movie "The Birds."

854
00:52:45,462 --> 00:52:54,212
The birds are the first ones to react to, like in a mine, they
react to the gas, that was basically the concept. That the bird

855
00:52:54,271 --> 00:52:57,343
was the warning signal of Freddy coming.

856
00:52:57,407 --> 00:53:00,854
So we built this demonic parakeet
and itwas demonic, I'll tell ya.

857
00:53:00,911 --> 00:53:03,858
It was oversized, it had a rod coming out of its butt

858
00:53:03,914 --> 00:53:05,985
and it could ï¬‚ap its wings and move its head.

859
00:53:06,049 --> 00:53:08,689
I think it didn't get used because
it wasn't parakeet-like enough.

860
00:53:08,952 --> 00:53:13,799
The physical effects guy was a guy
named Dick Albain, he was an old-timer.

861
00:53:14,224 --> 00:53:19,867
When I interviewed him I asked him what he felt his
greatest work was and he thought a minute and he said,

862
00:53:19,930 --> 00:53:22,604
"I think the work I did with the Three Stooges'

863
00:53:22,666 --> 00:53:24,009
was my greatest work."

864
00:53:24,067 --> 00:53:26,104
So that probably should have given me pause.

865
00:53:26,236 --> 00:53:33,051
He had this big long stick with this invisible fishing
cord tied to this prosthetic bird and

866
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:35,350
he would wave it back and forth in front of my face.

867
00:53:35,412 --> 00:53:36,652
He wanted it to attack.

868
00:53:36,813 --> 00:53:39,919
The parakeet was not exactly what I had in mind.

869
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:42,964
It was one of those things that we just did in five minutes.

870
00:53:43,019 --> 00:53:45,522
It just was so obvious that it wasn't going to work.

871
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:50,000
And sure enough, it cracked right into my eye, scarred it.

872
00:53:50,227 --> 00:53:54,698
I don't know if Clu ever recovered from the parakeet scene.
He's a little tweaked by it still.

873
00:53:54,898 --> 00:53:59,142
It scared the shit out of me. I was just petrified.

874
00:53:59,302 --> 00:54:04,274
It was a kind of a dopey scene.
I mean, a lot of the scenes in the movie were.

875
00:54:04,341 --> 00:54:06,878
Any movie with Clu Gulager and an exploding bird,
gotta be good.

876
00:54:07,110 --> 00:54:15,052
One of the film's many detours saw a role reversal that
introduced audiences to a new kind of horror hero,

877
00:54:15,118 --> 00:54:18,930
bringing Freddy out of the boiler room,
and most memorably, out of the closet.

878
00:54:18,989 --> 00:54:22,163
I think there was a certain amount of seduction
going on between Freddy and Jesse.

879
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:24,637
There always is a dance with Freddy.

880
00:54:24,694 --> 00:54:27,732
There always is a seduction, there always is a dare.

881
00:54:27,797 --> 00:54:35,045
And if Freddy was in fact what they always say Freddy was --
he was a pedophile, child killer -- sex meant nothing to him.

882
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:37,176
All he wanted was me.

883
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,913
Because I was the vehicle he was going to move through.

884
00:54:39,042 --> 00:54:44,458
Almost all the horror films of the '80s featured
women as the protagonist

885
00:54:44,514 --> 00:54:47,051
and it's not hard to understand why.

886
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:50,394
They were easier to portray as victims.

887
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:54,959
It just made the sexual threat and the chemistry richer.

888
00:54:55,025 --> 00:54:59,030
But I think they had to have made
"Nightmare on Elm Street Pan 2" to discover that.

889
00:54:59,162 --> 00:55:08,173
Because when you suddenly cast your male lead in the victim
role, and then you have him scream like a gin for 90 minutes,

890
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:15,383
you're going to have some people going,
"Well, that's not the manliest performance I've ever seen."

891
00:55:15,445 --> 00:55:16,753
<i>(screaming)</i>

892
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:19,861
In fact, I may be the first male scream queen.

893
00:55:20,016 --> 00:55:26,558
I simply did not have the self-awareness to realize
that any of this might be interpreted as gay.

894
00:55:26,723 --> 00:55:28,464
And I actually don't think that, originally,

895
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:30,627
Jesse was written as a gay character.

896
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:34,503
I think it's something that happened
along the line by serendipity.

897
00:55:34,664 --> 00:55:38,942
I also had not the slightest idea that
one of my lead actors was gay.

898
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:46,385
The fact that Mark Patton was an openly gay actor
I don't think had been revealed at that time yet.

899
00:55:46,443 --> 00:55:53,327
We made "Nightmare 2" absolutely clueless that it had
any gay overtones whatsoever.

900
00:55:53,450 --> 00:55:58,331
I'm absolutely sure there's not one moment
that I remember that it was discussed.

901
00:55:58,488 --> 00:55:59,728
I never saw it.

902
00:55:59,923 --> 00:56:00,731
I didn't get it.

903
00:56:00,890 --> 00:56:08,240
When I was shooting I had no notion this was happening. Although,
I didn't get a blowjob on the set, if that's what you mean.

904
00:56:08,431 --> 00:56:09,705
But looking back,

905
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:14,612
it was so gay, it was amazing.

906
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:20,117
If you're called the "Homo Nightmare on Elm Street"
on the net by a million pre-pubescent boys,

907
00:56:20,176 --> 00:56:23,282
<i>'men a bunch of grown men had m know what may were doing..</i>

908
00:56:23,713 --> 00:56:30,756
All I can say is we were all incredibly naive or
all incredibly latently gay. I'm not sure which.

909
00:56:30,820 --> 00:56:35,929
But I do think it remains one of the most sort of debated
movies of all time because it's so,

910
00:56:35,992 --> 00:56:37,801
it's not even under the surface, it's so there.

911
00:56:37,961 --> 00:56:39,963
You know, we've always pussyfooted around this.

912
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:45,512
Look, it was supposed to be subtext, alright, it really was.

913
00:56:45,668 --> 00:56:50,208
David Chaskin, without a doubt, knewvimat he was writing.

914
00:56:50,273 --> 00:56:53,652
You have to remember again, this was the 1980s,

915
00:56:53,710 --> 00:56:57,214
this was post-AIDS.
People were really out a lot then...

916
00:56:57,280 --> 00:57:00,557
maybe not in Kansas, but certainly on both coasts.

917
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:05,828
And I started thinking about guys being unsure of their sexuality

918
00:57:05,889 --> 00:57:08,233
and I thought, "Well, that's pretty scary."

919
00:57:08,291 --> 00:57:11,864
If David said that I am astounded,
because I certainly didn't get it either.

920
00:57:11,928 --> 00:57:18,368
There was so much like S & M and this
really precarious relationship

921
00:57:18,435 --> 00:57:21,006
between Mark Patton and I throughout the movie.

922
00:57:21,070 --> 00:57:24,449
It, you know, this is probably the "Top Gun"
of franchise horror films.

923
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:28,887
I kind of think there was this subliminal thing that was
going on in Jack's mind

924
00:57:28,945 --> 00:57:34,293
where he didn't really realize it,
but everything he did amplified it.

925
00:57:34,350 --> 00:57:37,297
You have a board game named "Probe" on it,

926
00:57:37,353 --> 00:57:40,266
he has a sign on the door that says "No Chicks Allowed."

927
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:42,530
The production designer in the film was gay.

928
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:47,003
And I think it became like an inside joke which
they thought nobody would really pick up on.

929
00:57:47,063 --> 00:57:55,107
But in terms of the kinky gimmick of "Part 2,"
I think it's really interesting.

930
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:57,117
Freddy appeals to that

931
00:57:57,173 --> 00:58:04,022
gay part that's like, the questions, he appeals to
the questions that Jesse's asking himself.

932
00:58:04,147 --> 00:58:08,960
Freddy could represent the self-hatred, you know,
in the gay community. He could also represent

933
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:10,725
just the taunt.

934
00:58:10,820 --> 00:58:12,925
"You son of a bitch!"

935
00:58:13,022 --> 00:58:19,268
I think that Mark gave a really great performance because
there were so many levels of his insecurities.

936
00:58:19,329 --> 00:58:21,605
And I think that's what I was doing in "Nightmare on Elm Street"

937
00:58:21,664 --> 00:58:24,076
is I was revealing who I really <i>was,</i>

938
00:58:24,133 --> 00:58:28,377
and I think that came clearly through the screen.

939
00:58:28,571 --> 00:58:33,281
The gayest thing in the movie, by the way,
is Bob Shaye himself.

940
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:39,157
Bob Shaye has always been a slightly fiustrated actor.
He had wanted to play

941
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:41,957
the father of Robert Rusler.

942
00:58:42,018 --> 00:58:49,493
I said, "I need a real actor to play that role."
Bob got very offended by that and, at one point,

943
00:58:49,559 --> 00:58:50,799
he even threatened to fire me.

944
00:58:50,960 --> 00:58:57,673
Jack could end up being a jerk from time to time
and that uvas one of his jerkier episodes.

945
00:58:57,734 --> 00:59:03,343
I said, "Well, let me give you another role."
So I thought, "Hey, I'll put him in this gay bar."

946
00:59:03,406 --> 00:59:07,013
Jack said, "Go to the Pleasure Chest

947
00:59:07,076 --> 00:59:09,283
and get yourself an outfit."

948
00:59:09,345 --> 00:59:13,122
So, I went to the Pleasure Chest and I happened
to have my two young daughters with me,

949
00:59:13,283 --> 00:59:18,392
who were like 10 and 12 at the time.
The guywho was the clerk was watching

950
00:59:18,454 --> 00:59:19,990
and my little daughter said, "Oh, there's a great

951
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:26,496
...thing to put on your arms with spikes and stuff," and
"Here's a great T-shirt for you, Papa," and stuff like that.

952
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:32,878
So the clerk comes over to me and he said, (laughing)
"I think these children should wait outside while you

953
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:34,472
purchase what you're going to be purchasing." (laughing)

954
00:59:34,537 --> 00:59:38,542
Bob Shaye looked darling in his leather costume.

955
00:59:38,608 --> 00:59:45,992
As the bartender. He was so sweet.
And I want you to know that we all believed him.

956
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:47,355
Hmm.

957
00:59:48,184 --> 00:59:49,060
(sighiï¬‚g)

958
00:59:50,887 --> 00:59:53,834
And then you have Coach Schneider's character.

959
00:59:53,890 --> 00:59:58,635
<i>He, like the character of Jesse, had some secrets.</i>

960
00:59:58,828 --> 01:00:02,207
I don't think Coach Schneiderwas ever a very good guy.

961
01:00:02,265 --> 01:00:06,736
I did direct a lot of the shower scene with Marshall Bell and,

962
01:00:06,803 --> 01:00:09,249
wow, what was I thinking?

963
01:00:09,305 --> 01:00:12,946
The Coach's balls being pan of the attack.

964
01:00:13,009 --> 01:00:17,822
I'm trying to think through whether or not
there was something Freudian about that.

965
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:23,796
I love that scene in the movie. I mean, I don't care for
Marshall Bell's ass, though. (laughing)

966
01:00:23,953 --> 01:00:28,163
I don't think it was my idea to
snap Marshall's bare ass with towels.

967
01:00:28,224 --> 01:00:31,603
It's what I would've liked to have seen happen to
my Phys. Ed. teacher in school.

968
01:00:31,661 --> 01:00:39,102
You get what you give in life and Coach Schneider was
really good at giving and he wasn't really great at receiving.

969
01:00:39,168 --> 01:00:44,379
Read into it what you will,
but I just thought it was a horror scene,

970
01:00:44,440 --> 01:00:46,920
which really makes me feel stupid.

971
01:00:48,878 --> 01:00:53,486
If there was one thing that I could delete from
my filmography and my entire life,

972
01:00:53,549 --> 01:00:55,392
it would be that dance scene in my bedroom.

973
01:00:55,451 --> 01:00:57,931
I actually find that scene a little bit embarrassing.

974
01:00:58,087 --> 01:01:01,534
"Risky Business" had had this very successful
scene with Tom Cruise.

975
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:04,071
We were just riffing on that particular

976
01:01:04,127 --> 01:01:07,700
pop culture deal. It was some really

977
01:01:07,764 --> 01:01:09,334
uncool dance moves.

978
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:10,543
Mark didn't want to do it.

979
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:16,651
And Mark kept kind of postponing it and finally, when
it came time getting closer to the scene, he said,

980
01:01:16,706 --> 01:01:21,177
"Look, I've got it all worked out,
just roll the cameras and let it go and I'll

981
01:01:21,244 --> 01:01:23,246
give you a whole performance."

982
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:27,590
And I'm going, "Oh God, this is not what I had in
mind." (laughing)

983
01:01:27,650 --> 01:01:31,655
I understand the video was played in gay clubs a lot.

984
01:01:31,721 --> 01:01:34,133
It will go along forever and ever and ever

985
01:01:34,190 --> 01:01:37,865
and my butt will bouncing and I'll have that
horrible hair and those hideous glasses.

986
01:01:37,927 --> 01:01:45,402
And, again, it was a choice. It was another one of those choices
that really brought the subtext way up right in yourface.

987
01:01:45,468 --> 01:01:47,141
When the shit hits the fan,

988
01:01:47,336 --> 01:01:50,010
Jesse rejects his girlfriend to go and stay at the house

989
01:01:50,073 --> 01:01:50,642
with the best friend.

990
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:53,845
"I need you to let me stay here tonight."
"Are you out of your mind?"

991
01:01:54,010 --> 01:01:58,083
I can't believe that this particular line is written this way.

992
01:01:58,147 --> 01:02:02,391
"Something is trying to get inside my body."
"And you want to sleep with me?"

993
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:06,992
(laughing) Sounds like, "And you want to sleep with me."

994
01:02:07,123 --> 01:02:12,368
At that point I realized, you know, a lot of people are
going to go down this road with these two boys.

995
01:02:12,428 --> 01:02:19,312
And you get the, one of the strangest,
most symbolic scenes potentially, in horror history,

996
01:02:19,368 --> 01:02:20,972
as Freddy tears his way out ofJesse's body.

997
01:02:21,104 --> 01:02:25,450
I remember the screenplay said distinctly,
"Freddy bursts out of Jesse."

998
01:02:25,508 --> 01:02:28,512
That's all it said. There was no
description of what we're going to do.

999
01:02:28,778 --> 01:02:32,453
Mark Shostrom created those effects
and he did a tremendous job.

1000
01:02:32,515 --> 01:02:35,325
And the effect of making the prosthesis

1001
01:02:35,384 --> 01:02:39,491
was very, very intense because you have to be buried alive
basically.

1002
01:02:39,555 --> 01:02:42,798
My main memories of Mark was like kind of reassuring him

1003
01:02:42,859 --> 01:02:45,635
because he had to have some life masks done

1004
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:48,232
that up until that time, I think, were maybe the best ones ever
achieved.

1005
01:02:48,297 --> 01:02:51,540
We did everything involving Jesse. The main sequence was
Freddy

1006
01:02:51,601 --> 01:02:53,080
breaking out of his body at the end.

1007
01:02:53,202 --> 01:02:58,379
It took us like 11 weeks to build everything
forthis one sequence

1008
01:02:58,441 --> 01:03:01,581
and pretty much every cut of that is a different effect.

1009
01:03:01,644 --> 01:03:04,022
The different phases of the transformation

1010
01:03:04,080 --> 01:03:07,391
it was storyboarded, designed very specifically.

1011
01:03:07,450 --> 01:03:11,523
We designed several different concepts for Jesse's
transformation.

1012
01:03:11,587 --> 01:03:13,498
The blades growing... the eye in the throat.

1013
01:03:13,556 --> 01:03:16,503
Probably a little too reminiscent of "American Werewolf in
London?

1014
01:03:16,559 --> 01:03:18,766
We had a dummy head of <i>Jesse's</i> face...

1015
01:03:18,828 --> 01:03:20,865
which actually Kevin Yaghefs girlfriend

1016
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:23,137
played Freddy's eye looking up at the back of the throat

1017
01:03:23,199 --> 01:03:27,477
because she had a head small enough to fit inside our dummy
head.

1018
01:03:27,537 --> 01:03:32,111
I'd never seen anything like that. It was the most
extraordinary thing I had ever seen.

1019
01:03:32,175 --> 01:03:34,553
In Grady's death, lthought

1020
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:35,748
it came out really well.

1021
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:40,521
I thought that I was gonna get a major prosthetic slash.

1022
01:03:40,583 --> 01:03:45,828
I wanted to see this mist of blood all over the place
and we didn't quite get that.

1023
01:03:45,888 --> 01:03:48,095
We didn't have time to do...

1024
01:03:48,157 --> 01:03:50,364
proper makeup

1025
01:03:50,426 --> 01:03:54,841
and as an actor, you're like, "Well, wait a minute,
you know, hook me up.

1026
01:03:54,897 --> 01:03:58,208
Let's do the mmole thing." I don't know how to explain it,

1027
01:03:58,267 --> 01:04:01,874
but the rhythm of the movie, wnen I die it stunned everybody.

1028
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:10,358
There's a lot of "oohs" and "aahs" and abrupt screams, you
know. And in that whole movie the whole theater was silent.

1029
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:17,126
Despite its daring choices, the film prompted
the biggest debate in the history of the franchise.

1030
01:04:17,186 --> 01:04:22,431
You know, everybody says that "Nightmare 2" kind of
took a turn from the rest of the series,

1031
01:04:22,491 --> 01:04:24,767
but there was no rest of the series at the time.

1032
01:04:24,827 --> 01:04:25,532
I can remember

1033
01:04:25,595 --> 01:04:29,202
those awkward times on the set,
it just didn't feel right already.

1034
01:04:29,365 --> 01:04:36,647
I remember really bringing up the script issues and saying,
"This is really, really problematic. Especially the ending."

1035
01:04:36,706 --> 01:04:39,016
I do remember Freddy

1036
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:40,110
coming out of a pool party and feeling like, "Oh my God."

1037
01:04:40,243 --> 01:04:44,714
Wes objected to the fact that Freddy appears
when everybody's awake.

1038
01:04:44,780 --> 01:04:49,388
There are certain rules you don't break and in the
Wes Craven Bible, we broke a couple of rules.

1039
01:04:49,452 --> 01:04:52,899
If he's out someplace, just out in the open
and surrounded by big teenagers,

1040
01:04:52,955 --> 01:04:59,395
it's not going to have the power, you're just running
up against the wall right away as a director to make that scary.

1041
01:04:59,462 --> 01:05:02,807
The pool sequence I remember.
I think we were there for two weeks.

1042
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:04,742
It was a lot of shooting. Chaos

1043
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,040
and swimming and fire.

1044
01:05:06,168 --> 01:05:14,644
And I think there was more tension in terms of Jacques Haitkin
just struggling all the time to make the film look good knowing

1045
01:05:14,710 --> 01:05:17,748
there were things like this pool party that
just made absolutely no sense.

1046
01:05:17,813 --> 01:05:20,885
We were bound to some extent by the script.

1047
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:25,194
New Line developed the script and we're hired to shoot pages.

1048
01:05:25,254 --> 01:05:27,894
We were all just basically trying to get the work done.

1049
01:05:27,957 --> 01:05:33,168
I do have a couple of bad memories of just going, "This isn't
going to work, this scene. Why are we doing this scene?"

1050
01:05:33,229 --> 01:05:36,904
"You are all my children now."

1051
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:43,279
"You're all my children now" I think, was the phrase he made up.
He got into the character to the point Wnere the character

1052
01:05:43,339 --> 01:05:46,081
was telling him more about himself.

1053
01:05:46,142 --> 01:05:50,591
There comes a point when you're playing a character a lot
When you know more about him than anybody else.

1054
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:54,116
You just have this sixth sense about mmafs
right and what's wrong.

1055
01:05:54,183 --> 01:06:03,592
What we were looking for at the end was to open up our film as
much as we could in a movie that could not afford visual effects

1056
01:06:03,659 --> 01:06:05,969
or big map paintings or big sets.

1057
01:06:06,028 --> 01:06:08,907
Lisa confronts Freddy to save her boyfriend

1058
01:06:08,965 --> 01:06:09,807
to save Jesse.

1059
01:06:09,865 --> 01:06:15,076
We found spectacular iron foundry that is so incredibly huge

1060
01:06:15,137 --> 01:06:16,980
that we don't have enough lights to light it.

1061
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:19,246
There was a scene involving a mutant rat

1062
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:20,548
and a mutant cat.

1063
01:06:20,609 --> 01:06:24,421
And I have to be honest, because I was working on "Aliens"

1064
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:28,986
I didn't pay too much attention and
those didn't turn out too good.

1065
01:06:30,453 --> 01:06:32,455
The same thing with the dogs from hell,

1066
01:06:32,521 --> 01:06:34,398
you know, with the masks on.

1067
01:06:34,457 --> 01:06:37,336
I was imagining them a little more frightening.

1068
01:06:37,393 --> 01:06:41,364
I did a robotic life mask for the very end
when I burn up in that.

1069
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:42,909
This meltdown head that I built,

1070
01:06:42,965 --> 01:06:47,846
it was simple mechanisms with toothpicks and super glue
and dental acrylic and it was just thrown together,

1071
01:06:47,903 --> 01:06:50,315
but, to me it was this big huge thing we were building.

1072
01:06:50,373 --> 01:06:54,913
Awax bust was put under hair dryers andjust melted.

1073
01:06:54,977 --> 01:06:59,187
So, he melted away and that was the
only set up we had of that shot.

1074
01:06:59,248 --> 01:07:01,728
I save the hero.

1075
01:07:01,784 --> 01:07:05,630
Her character tumed out to be the backbone of the movie.

1076
01:07:05,688 --> 01:07:09,101
That's why she's the one that finally
confronted Freddy and won.

1077
01:07:09,158 --> 01:07:14,540
The character of Jesse <i>is,</i>
in theater and movies, a female pan.

1078
01:07:14,597 --> 01:07:17,703
I was the woman and Lisa was the man.

1079
01:07:17,767 --> 01:07:21,374
Ultimately, he finds love through a heterosexual encounter,

1080
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:25,408
at the end, but they could just be good friends after that,
I don't know. (laughing)

1081
01:07:25,574 --> 01:07:32,014
Lisa and Jesse could've been sort of the "Will and Grace"
of the horror genre.

1082
01:07:32,148 --> 01:07:33,923
Then the coda comes,

1083
01:07:33,983 --> 01:07:35,690
you know, the famous Bob Shaye coda.

1084
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:36,957
Back on the bus.

1085
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:45,097
There was a guy underneath my chair with his hand basically
up inside my shirt ready to go like this at the end of the movie.

1086
01:07:45,161 --> 01:07:48,074
"It's all over."

1087
01:07:48,130 --> 01:07:52,977
We didn't have a happy ending on "Nightmare 2" either,
did we? We sent 'em off down on a bus to hell.

1088
01:07:53,035 --> 01:07:53,877
We kill 'em all.

1089
01:07:53,936 --> 01:07:55,745
I do believe that he survived. I don't think

1090
01:07:55,805 --> 01:07:58,809
they went off into the desert and burned him up or something.

1091
01:07:58,874 --> 01:08:00,717
He didn't go to Burning Man, let's put it that way.

1092
01:08:00,876 --> 01:08:05,347
Opening on November 1, 1985 to mixed reviews

1093
01:08:05,448 --> 01:08:10,193
Freddy proved his power at the box office
with numbers that New Line could not ignore.

1094
01:08:10,286 --> 01:08:16,328
At that time sequels would make 60, 50%
of what the original made,

1095
01:08:16,392 --> 01:08:19,635
so they were expecting that "Nightmare on Elm Street 2"

1096
01:08:19,795 --> 01:08:27,737
they were hoping it would do 70% of what the first one did. it
ended up doing 150% ofwlwat the first one did.

1097
01:08:27,970 --> 01:08:33,613
"Nightmare on Elm Street" was sold out in every theater in
New York for every show by 10:30 in the morning.

1098
01:08:33,676 --> 01:08:38,676
I don't think it was until after "Nightmare 2" came out and
we started seeing these huge numbers

1099
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:43,928
that they realized that they had a franchise.

1100
01:08:44,019 --> 01:08:48,695
You saw a man who suddenly opened up andjust was
staring into the future

1101
01:08:48,757 --> 01:08:51,260
with the most shit-eating grin you ever saw.

1102
01:08:51,393 --> 01:08:59,210
"Nightmare on Elm Street 2" rocked Europe because they
picked up on the whole psychosexual, homoerotic subtext.

1103
01:08:59,268 --> 01:09:01,111
They love that film in Europe.

1104
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:06,170
<i>I give New Line</i> a <i>lot of credit for the success of
the series because what they were</i>

1105
01:09:07,443 --> 01:09:10,890
willing to do was not just do
the same thing over and over again.

1106
01:09:11,046 --> 01:09:15,683
It's pretty interesting that in that day and age,
as a sequel to a pretty successful film,

1107
01:09:15,684 --> 01:09:18,987
that they went that direction and made those choices.
Pretty ballsy. No pun intended.

1108
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:24,438
I mean just to take the chances with the sequel
that they did was bravery or stupidity.

1109
01:09:24,493 --> 01:09:30,739
We definitely earned our share of criticisms of pretty much
everything from

1110
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:35,179
the nature of the film to the execution of the film.

1111
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:42,621
We were trying to do something different, something original that hadn't
been done in the first one. it was clear that it didn't work as well.

1112
01:09:42,678 --> 01:09:46,057
It's always hard to do a sequel
'cause the first one'sjust so good.

1113
01:09:46,115 --> 01:09:52,532
The second one was not quite as pure.
It was much more of a commercial piece.

1114
01:09:52,588 --> 01:10:01,804
I don't thinkWes communicated his displeasure with the thing to me directly,
but I realized that soon afierwards that it was really a bad idea. (laughing)

1115
01:10:01,931 --> 01:10:08,541
it didn't have a unity to it, it just had a bunch of scenes,
which I thinkthe worst of the sequels or the worst moments...

1116
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:16,750
of the sequels, were just kind of striking scenes,
but "overall" the story didn't often cohere very well.

1117
01:10:16,946 --> 01:10:23,454
I'm proud that I did the film. The film really was the film
that gave me a career as a film director.

1118
01:10:23,519 --> 01:10:25,226
Jack knew what he was doing.

1119
01:10:25,287 --> 01:10:29,497
We found out his next film, "Hidden," an American classic.

1120
01:10:29,625 --> 01:10:34,506
Cracked Magazine sent me
'The 10 Gayest Horror Movies Ever Made,'

1121
01:10:34,630 --> 01:10:37,611
and "Nightmare on Elm Street 2" was #1.

1122
01:10:37,666 --> 01:10:39,043
That I wear like a badge of honor.

1123
01:10:39,201 --> 01:10:44,651
I'm so proud to be pan of that, (laughing) I really am.
That makes me really happy. Cool.

1124
01:10:44,707 --> 01:10:47,654
The experience of making "Nightmare on Elm Street" was
wonderful.

1125
01:10:47,710 --> 01:10:51,658
Even ifClu didn't get a blowjob (laughing) on the set.

1126
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:58,288
One day I did discover a hand in my trousers, but I just
thought, "Boys will be boys." (sighing) Hmm.

1127
01:11:09,565 --> 01:11:14,565
Aware of Freddy's potential, but dismayed by the lukewarm
reception irom critics and fans alike,

1128
01:11:15,271 --> 01:11:22,246
New Line Cinema was determined to get their franchise back
on track, by recruiting some old friends and some new blood.

1129
01:11:22,311 --> 01:11:26,191
"2" had its serious difficulties,

1130
01:11:26,248 --> 01:11:30,196
although it did well just based on the reputation

1131
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:33,392
and the growing interest in this storyline

1132
01:11:33,455 --> 01:11:35,264
and particularly in Freddy.

1133
01:11:35,324 --> 01:11:37,895
Even though it was a successful film in terms of box ofï¬‚ce,

1134
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:43,171
it was a great disappointment, so I thinkthere was a
huge amount riding on what to do in "Nightmare 3."

1135
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:48,978
On every "Nightmare" I would go back to Wes Craven and
ask him if he was interested, so Wes wrote the

1136
01:11:49,038 --> 01:11:51,040
original script for "Nightmare 3."

1137
01:11:51,106 --> 01:11:56,249
I wanted to take it up to the next level. I felt like if I'm going
to do another one I want it to be somehow better.

1138
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,189
I came up with the idea and then

1139
01:11:58,247 --> 01:12:02,559
Bruce Wagner and I wrote, I think,
a really interesting first draft.

1140
01:12:02,618 --> 01:12:04,291
It had a lot of good stuff in it

1141
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:08,802
and I think Wes did less of the writing and Bruce did more.

1142
01:12:08,857 --> 01:12:11,360
I was just about to start shooting "Deadly Friend."

1143
01:12:11,427 --> 01:12:14,374
I'd go away into pre-production and
Bruce would be (typing sound).

1144
01:12:14,430 --> 01:12:19,133
But it didn't quite work. it was a very ambitious script,
but it didn't have

1145
01:12:19,134 --> 01:12:24,134
a lot of the human vulnerabilities and
the characteristics we wanted.

1146
01:12:25,441 --> 01:12:32,051
There were no rules. Everybody could do everything.
So it was just the kitchen sink thrown in and all the really

1147
01:12:32,114 --> 01:12:36,688
elemental, scary things that in "Nightmare 1"
had worked so well, was just,

1148
01:12:36,752 --> 01:12:39,198
it felt like, "I'm just gonna throw a bunch of junk in

1149
01:12:39,254 --> 01:12:40,995
<i>'k was good for mat it was..</i>

1150
01:12:41,056 --> 01:12:42,558
Wejust believed it needed more.

1151
01:12:42,624 --> 01:12:46,766
We were in the process of rewriting that script with Wes

1152
01:12:46,829 --> 01:12:50,333
when our producers at the time had met with

1153
01:12:50,399 --> 01:12:56,145
some young, smart up-an-coming writer-directors,
Frank Darabont and Chuck Russell.

1154
01:12:56,205 --> 01:13:01,154
And they said, "Please hear their pitch. They have a
great pitch. We thinkthis is the best way to go."

1155
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:06,956
When I convinced Bob and Sara that Chuck was the guy,
that he was going to be able to write a really good scnpt for it.

1156
01:13:07,049 --> 01:13:11,327
The whole series was in question. They really didn't know
ifth ey wanted to continue,

1157
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:15,836
so I was pushing the company itself. Let's make the third
more fun, let's take

1158
01:13:15,891 --> 01:13:19,065
the boundaries of imagination a little bit further
in the whole series.

1159
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:23,508
I give Chuck complete credit for wrhat happen ed with the script
in "Nightmare 3." -- he and Frank Darabont.

1160
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:27,775
The original script to "Elm Street 3" was darker and

1161
01:13:27,836 --> 01:13:34,583
actually profane. I think Wes was trying to take it even into a
more horrific place.

1162
01:13:34,643 --> 01:13:38,147
And I was much more interested in the imaginative
element to the piece.

1163
01:13:38,213 --> 01:13:42,787
In fairness to the others who participated,
Frank Darabont and his partner,

1164
01:13:42,851 --> 01:13:43,989
they did some great stuff to it.

1165
01:13:44,052 --> 01:13:47,056
And they changed the game completely.

1166
01:13:47,122 --> 01:13:50,160
But, the script came in and it's like, "Holy shit, this is huge."

1167
01:13:50,225 --> 01:13:53,001
This is like a $20 million script that nowwe have to make.

1168
01:13:53,061 --> 01:14:00,309
The budgets involved in the series, that was another limitation, but
you know, that brings out the best in you. I think every filmmaker

1169
01:14:00,369 --> 01:14:04,374
has to kind of rise to the occasion when you
start your career on a limited budget.

1170
01:14:04,440 --> 01:14:12,018
Despite Wes Craven's eany departure from the project, another
familiar face would make a welcome return to Elm Street.

1171
01:14:12,080 --> 01:14:16,825
Bringing Nancy back was another hook that I thought
was great for the series.

1172
01:14:16,885 --> 01:14:19,331
Wes Craven called me and asked if I would mind if he included

1173
01:14:19,388 --> 01:14:27,273
my character in a script he was writing for "Nightmare 3" and he
gave me the basic idea ofhow she comes back

1174
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:29,832
and is a psychologist for kids

1175
01:14:29,898 --> 01:14:31,969
who are having these terrible nightmares.

1176
01:14:32,034 --> 01:14:36,176
It took some convincing. She had other things
going on in her life at the time, but she did a great job

1177
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:40,846
and the character became a leader of sort of
a new generation of "Elm Street" kids.

1178
01:14:40,943 --> 01:14:43,856
You've got this great gimmick of
Heather as the binding element

1179
01:14:43,912 --> 01:14:46,688
Heathers the one that's been through it
and can tell them all mmats going on

1180
01:14:46,782 --> 01:14:50,355
"You are the last of the Elm Street children."

1181
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:54,993
The cast was just sensational, all these
young actors were so good,

1182
01:14:55,057 --> 01:15:00,302
which made this particular film stand out from
other horror films at the time.

1183
01:15:00,362 --> 01:15:08,304
"Kincaid, an enormous and powerful-looking 17-year-old with a
shaved head is huddled in the corner of a white padded room."

1184
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:13,370
It was a well-built, muscular guy and I looked in the mirror and
looked at me and said, "Oh, hell no." So... (laughing)

1185
01:15:18,447 --> 01:15:22,793
But my agent talked me into going anyway. So I had to catch
the bus and get to the audition. It was just pouring down rain,

1186
01:15:22,851 --> 01:15:26,196
it was running late and I was getting pissed.

1187
01:15:26,255 --> 01:15:32,763
So when I went in the director said,
"Just do whatever you want to."

1188
01:15:32,828 --> 01:15:34,068
And I said, "Fuck you!"

1189
01:15:34,129 --> 01:15:37,667
And that's how I got it. I cussed his ass out. (laughing)

1190
01:15:37,733 --> 01:15:42,079
"Pan to Joey, a wan 16-year-old watching them
fiom around the comer.

1191
01:15:42,137 --> 01:15:44,515
<i>'He has a tear drop drawn in ink under one eye?'</i>

1192
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:46,575
In preparing for the role of Joey,

1193
01:15:46,642 --> 01:15:49,646
I had no lines until the very end of the script.

1194
01:15:49,711 --> 01:15:51,554
The characterwas completely mute.

1195
01:15:51,613 --> 01:15:54,719
Showing as much as I could with my eyes.

1196
01:15:54,783 --> 01:16:01,064
"Jennifer, a girl of 14, approaches. She extends her hand for
inspection -- it is scarred with cigarette burns."

1197
01:16:01,123 --> 01:16:05,594
There wasn't a lot of rehearsal for the role.

1198
01:16:05,661 --> 01:16:09,131
That was something we all had to do on our ovm.

1199
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:13,145
I just tried to connect with the
emotional state of that character.

1200
01:16:13,201 --> 01:16:20,278
"Taryn, a 17-year-old girl, approaches.
She appears exhausted, dark tired circles under her eyes."

1201
01:16:20,342 --> 01:16:26,122
How I approached the characterwas
pretty much in the moment.

1202
01:16:26,181 --> 01:16:29,355
She has a drug problem. I think she has something hidden.

1203
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:31,056
She has some kind of secret.

1204
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:38,936
"All the kids of the Adolescent Care Unit are gathered:
Kincaid, Phillip, Taryn, Joey, Jennifer, and VIï¬‚II,

1205
01:16:38,994 --> 01:16:42,237
a 17-year-old confined to an electric wheelchair."

1206
01:16:42,297 --> 01:16:46,006
I have to tell you, growing up I played
so much Dungeons & Dragons,

1207
01:16:46,068 --> 01:16:50,073
I really felt secure with the aspect of the Wizard Master.

1208
01:16:50,138 --> 01:16:52,049
I mean, I was meant to play this role.

1209
01:16:52,107 --> 01:16:54,178
The cast member that stuck out to me was Patricia Arquette.

1210
01:16:54,242 --> 01:16:59,351
It was her first film. There was something so interesting
and so haunting about her.

1211
01:16:59,414 --> 01:17:05,228
And I think that's always been a special gifi for her
in her other work as well.

1212
01:17:05,287 --> 01:17:08,996
At least a third of the male cast fell in love with Patricia.

1213
01:17:09,057 --> 01:17:10,468
<i>â€œKnow Rodney'</i>

1214
01:17:10,525 --> 01:17:12,368
was in love with Patricia.

1215
01:17:12,427 --> 01:17:13,838
I'm mean like lovelorn.

1216
01:17:13,895 --> 01:17:22,280
He had mad affection for Patricia Arqu ette, you know. He didn't
talk in the film but his ass was talking off the film. (laughing)

1217
01:17:22,337 --> 01:17:28,344
It was so funny because they were all coming to me for advice,
like, you know, I was dating her or something.

1218
01:17:28,410 --> 01:17:30,481
Nobody had a crush on me.

1219
01:17:30,545 --> 01:17:32,616
Everybody was in love with somebody else.

1220
01:17:32,681 --> 01:17:37,687
I think it also helped us off-set. We all became good friends.

1221
01:17:37,753 --> 01:17:39,994
I wanted to do something about

1222
01:17:40,055 --> 01:17:42,558
the bonding of kids at that age.

1223
01:17:42,624 --> 01:17:49,599
I think the beauty of the uvhole "Elm Street" series is that
there's something the kids know that their parents don't believe.

1224
01:17:49,665 --> 01:17:54,665
In "Nightmare 1" and "3" Wes really explores why
authority figures are trying the best they can and are failing.

1225
01:18:00,409 --> 01:18:06,257
At that time there was kind of a movement of such places
that even advertised on television,

1226
01:18:06,314 --> 01:18:11,957
"Send us yourtroubled child and we'll make them okay." And,
essentially, they were like prisons or, you know, insane asylums.

1227
01:18:12,020 --> 01:18:14,728
(screaming)
"Take her to a quiet room and sedate her."

1228
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:22,436
A lot of afï¬‚cionados of the show would come up and say,
"Why were you so mean?" And I'd think, "Was I mean?

1229
01:18:22,497 --> 01:18:25,103
I didn't mean to be mean." (laughing) Because

1230
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:28,614
I had thought ofher as a very respectable person
who was doing her best.

1231
01:18:28,670 --> 01:18:29,910
So I thought I was a good guy.

1232
01:18:29,971 --> 01:18:37,219
It was a great horror riff on adolescence, on the point in our lives
vlmen we all realize the world is not such a nice place, and maybe

1233
01:18:37,279 --> 01:18:41,921
everything weve learned in school or our parents have told us
isn't exactly true.

1234
01:18:41,983 --> 01:18:46,056
One of the worst threats to them is the parents,
(laughing) the "good intentions" of the parents.

1235
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:51,571
When it happens in "Nightmare 3" where Kristen
is, like, in her bedroom and her mom has some guy over,

1236
01:18:51,626 --> 01:18:54,903
"Honey, I've got a guest."
"And you don't want to keep him waiting."

1237
01:18:54,963 --> 01:18:57,102
it's just tawdry and it's sad.

1238
01:18:57,299 --> 01:19:05,480
My daughter 'Fiffany and I had a difficult relationship.
She was a teenager at the time, and, interestingly enough,

1239
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:08,544
she has done several horror movies herself.

1240
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:14,788
So I used it, I just kind of fell into that mode of "mom with
teen age daughterâ€œ thing that really didn't require a lot of acting.

1241
01:19:14,850 --> 01:19:20,163
And there's just something so real about that scene.
Every time I look at it, I'm like, "Whew." (sighing)

1242
01:19:20,222 --> 01:19:25,331
I do believe that my character was definitely
part of the mob that went after Freddy.

1243
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:29,808
Elaine was guilt-ridden and she had
this kind of bravado to cover it up.

1244
01:19:29,865 --> 01:19:33,108
But deep dovm inside, it's like,
"Oh my God, what have I done?"

1245
01:19:33,168 --> 01:19:34,511
I got demoted from

1246
01:19:34,569 --> 01:19:42,886
Lt. Thompson to a security guard with suggestions of
being a little bit of a drunkard, I think.

1247
01:19:43,044 --> 01:19:47,220
He realizes that he's made the wrong choices
regarding his daughter.

1248
01:19:47,282 --> 01:19:50,422
I think he realizes right there that he's ruined Nancy's life.

1249
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:54,028
He was a broken man as a result ofvmat had happened.

1250
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:58,102
And that leads to his sense of failure as a man and as a father.

1251
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:00,299
"Fred Krueger is dead."

1252
01:20:00,462 --> 01:20:03,671
It touched a little bit on the idea of

1253
01:20:03,732 --> 01:20:05,712
suicide in the young.

1254
01:20:05,767 --> 01:20:08,338
Young people and suicide is a tremendous question.

1255
01:20:08,403 --> 01:20:11,407
Looking back now, there was a whole lot

1256
01:20:11,473 --> 01:20:15,182
of suicide movies in the '80s. There really were.

1257
01:20:15,310 --> 01:20:22,125
I thinkthe "Nightmare" series, it's a message to parents
to please listen to your kid. Your kid's not crazy,

1258
01:20:22,184 --> 01:20:23,720
your kid's not making stuff up.

1259
01:20:23,885 --> 01:20:30,029
To me that was the metaphor of "Elm Street," and
"Dream Warriors" took it just a step further.

1260
01:20:30,091 --> 01:20:36,167
While the young cast immersed themselves in their roles,
the team of special effects wizards behind "Nightmare 3"

1261
01:20:36,231 --> 01:20:40,441
found themselves faced with a mmole new set of challenges.

1262
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:42,945
I read the script and loved it because it was just full of effects.

1263
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:48,920
And I kind of pitched to them, "Listen, I'll do the movie,
but I want to do all the effects."

1264
01:20:48,977 --> 01:20:52,390
And they were stupid enough to do it. No, they actually were
really kind enough to give me the mmole show.

1265
01:20:52,547 --> 01:20:57,496
It looked like the script was going to be more fantasy,
you know, and fun.

1266
01:20:57,552 --> 01:21:00,897
I had to make it magical. I was going to be the one who was
going to give it the look.

1267
01:21:01,122 --> 01:21:08,040
All the money that was spent was not spent on anything other
than effects. Effects got everything.

1268
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:13,739
There was an image with a roasted pig on a table that was a
kind of a classic, nightmarish image.

1269
01:21:14,002 --> 01:21:17,074
All of a sudden this pig said, (growling pig)
(screaming)

1270
01:21:17,138 --> 01:21:26,217
The budget was astronomical for making an animatronic pig.
We ultimately just roasted a pig and let it spoil and

1271
01:21:26,281 --> 01:21:31,822
the prop guys had to choose straws
as to who got to puppet it from beneath.

1272
01:21:31,887 --> 01:21:34,026
The pig absolutely stunk.

1273
01:21:34,089 --> 01:21:38,094
But ultimately it looks gnanier because it's real.

1274
01:21:38,159 --> 01:21:38,637
I can still

1275
01:21:38,693 --> 01:21:40,229
smell that pig to this day.

1276
01:21:40,295 --> 01:21:42,536
My main job for "Nightmare 3" was

1277
01:21:42,597 --> 01:21:44,304
the baby in the beginning of the film.

1278
01:21:44,366 --> 01:21:48,644
Patricia Arquette is running through the house
and she rescues the little girl.

1279
01:21:48,703 --> 01:21:53,982
And when I met with Chuck Russell and I asked him kind of
what he was looking for, he told me two words.

1280
01:21:54,042 --> 01:21:55,817
He goes, "ThinkAuschm/itz."

1281
01:21:55,877 --> 01:22:00,849
And I did a life-size sculpture of the 5-year-old girl
that was emaciated and shriveled

1282
01:22:00,916 --> 01:22:01,986
and skeletal,

1283
01:22:02,050 --> 01:22:07,363
I spent 10 weeks constructing this mechanical puppet,
which is very realistic in detail.

1284
01:22:07,422 --> 01:22:09,698
When they brought it in to Chuck and I

1285
01:22:09,758 --> 01:22:14,173
it was so terrifying and so grotesque and horrific that

1286
01:22:14,229 --> 01:22:16,209
we felt like it just, we shouldn't do it.

1287
01:22:16,364 --> 01:22:18,537
And they never even rolled film on it.

1288
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:21,911
I think they ended up having a prop guy super glue some

1289
01:22:21,970 --> 01:22:23,813
fake skeleton together in about 10 minutes.

1290
01:22:23,872 --> 01:22:24,350
So they used that.

1291
01:22:24,539 --> 01:22:28,453
Well the biggest challenge for "Nightmare on Elm Street 3"
was probably the snake sequence.

1292
01:22:28,510 --> 01:22:31,423
The scene with PatriciaArquette and the worm monster

1293
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:36,087
is often mentioned as a wild point in the picture.

1294
01:22:36,151 --> 01:22:41,123
That was a really exciting thing for me because it was
the first, you know, gigantic puppet I've ever made.

1295
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:42,634
When I first saw the prop

1296
01:22:42,691 --> 01:22:45,604
I was stunned, because it was very, very phallic.

1297
01:22:45,660 --> 01:22:47,469
Chuck and I started laughing when we saw it.

1298
01:22:47,529 --> 01:22:50,373
I said, "You think what I think?"

1299
01:22:50,432 --> 01:22:55,814
He just said, "This looks like a penis." And I said, "Yeah,
remember we talked about it? We had meetings about this."

1300
01:22:55,870 --> 01:22:58,908
He said, "I can't do that. We can't make it look like a penis."

1301
01:22:59,107 --> 01:23:06,753
I immediately called in the set painters and said, "Look, at least change
the color." (laughing) We tried to throw the thing into blues and greens

1302
01:23:06,815 --> 01:23:08,954
so it wouldn't be quite so Freudian.

1303
01:23:09,017 --> 01:23:12,760
That monster was wonderful in concept an.

1304
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:17,463
In reality, it was a big prop that was actually a bit dangerous.

1305
01:23:17,525 --> 01:23:20,529
"Ready? Go!"
(screaming)

1306
01:23:20,762 --> 01:23:25,472
It was really a scary thing to watch Patricia being eaten by that.

1307
01:23:25,667 --> 01:23:28,238
It was huge and so she was like in there.

1308
01:23:28,436 --> 01:23:30,245
We did a lot of reverse in those days.

1309
01:23:30,305 --> 01:23:33,081
In fact, when Patricia Arquette's being eaten by the snake,

1310
01:23:33,141 --> 01:23:35,382
she's actually being pulled off.

1311
01:23:35,443 --> 01:23:41,450
The whole piece actually looked quite good that way.
It gave it an eerie, dreamy aspect. But really we did it

1312
01:23:41,516 --> 01:23:43,257
that way because the prop didn't work.

1313
01:23:43,318 --> 01:23:47,425
But also, we had three or four different puppets. We had
one that swallowed Patricia that was only like 6 feet long.

1314
01:23:47,489 --> 01:23:51,995
Then we had one that was even longer for this overhead shot,
then he regurgitates her. That was another one.

1315
01:23:52,060 --> 01:23:53,004
And then the final one was this

1316
01:23:53,061 --> 01:23:56,167
whole mechanical thing that was a big,
huge snake that kind of rears up and

1317
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:57,403
it was a radio-controlled face.

1318
01:23:57,565 --> 01:24:00,011
Knowing how much work went into that and knowing

1319
01:24:00,068 --> 01:24:02,947
how diff cult it was to kind of get that thing to set,

1320
01:24:03,004 --> 01:24:09,478
I would've gone and bowed on hands and knees to him then
because it was really an imaginative, really unusual effect.

1321
01:24:09,644 --> 01:24:12,352
<i>'The puppet sequence -â€˜</i>

1322
01:24:12,414 --> 01:24:14,189
mmere the marionette that's hanging on the wall
turns into Freddy

1323
01:24:14,249 --> 01:24:16,058
then he severs himself off

1324
01:24:16,117 --> 01:24:17,528
and then grows to be normal size --

1325
01:24:17,585 --> 01:24:18,393
that was pretty creepy.

1326
01:24:18,453 --> 01:24:19,363
We actually made

1327
01:24:19,421 --> 01:24:24,598
a series of heads that we would, in camera, dissolve

1328
01:24:24,659 --> 01:24:25,763
from one head to the next.

1329
01:24:25,827 --> 01:24:28,137
Bradley and the marionette

1330
01:24:28,196 --> 01:24:29,266
tendons, you know,

1331
01:24:29,330 --> 01:24:31,469
people just love that imagery.

1332
01:24:31,533 --> 01:24:34,844
It was done by Greg Cannom -- my old boss --
and he did a fantasticjob.

1333
01:24:34,903 --> 01:24:39,443
I also remember Bradley Gregg during lunchtime

1334
01:24:39,507 --> 01:24:42,716
just looked like spaghetti sauce all over him
and spaghetti arms.

1335
01:24:42,777 --> 01:24:45,656
Eating lunch, you know, as if it was no problem.

1336
01:24:45,713 --> 01:24:47,784
And he's sitting next to me and they had to

1337
01:24:47,849 --> 01:24:50,659
roll the veins so they didn't like get knotted or anything.

1338
01:24:50,718 --> 01:24:56,760
I'm sitting next to him reading and I'm just looking at him, going,
"Oh My God, Oh My God, Oh My God. Oh, this is awful."

1339
01:24:56,825 --> 01:25:01,570
The work that Greg and everyone did in effects
was absolutely extraordinary.

1340
01:25:01,629 --> 01:25:06,738
And the funny thing you have to remember about this film
is virtually everything was done physically on it.

1341
01:25:06,801 --> 01:25:14,686
You know, in a way we're responsible for making the Freddy
character a little bit more of a pop character.A media character.

1342
01:25:14,742 --> 01:25:17,279
And the Dick Cavett scene was a big part of that.

1343
01:25:17,345 --> 01:25:19,416
We spent a half a day shooting

1344
01:25:19,481 --> 01:25:21,017
Dick Cavett and he said, "Well they told me I could pick

1345
01:25:21,082 --> 01:25:22,220
whoever I wanted.

1346
01:25:22,283 --> 01:25:26,163
So I picked Zsa Zsa Gabor because I think she's
the dumbest person I've ever met in my life

1347
01:25:26,221 --> 01:25:31,466
and I'd never have her on my show.
And if there was one person I would want to see killed

1348
01:25:31,526 --> 01:25:33,301
by Freddy, it would be her."
(screaming)

1349
01:25:33,495 --> 01:25:37,568
My other favorite kill from "Nightmare 3" was

1350
01:25:37,632 --> 01:25:41,444
when Penelope Sudrows character was lifted up

1351
01:25:41,503 --> 01:25:44,416
by the TV set with the great line,

1352
01:25:44,472 --> 01:25:48,682
"Welcome to prime time, bitch."
(screaming)

1353
01:25:48,743 --> 01:25:50,120
"Welcome to prime time, bitch."

1354
01:25:50,178 --> 01:25:51,418
"Welcome to prime time, bitch."

1355
01:25:51,479 --> 01:25:53,481
"Welcome to prime time, bitch."

1356
01:25:53,548 --> 01:25:54,993
(laughing) Really a priceless line.

1357
01:25:55,049 --> 01:25:55,789
It was just classic.

1358
01:25:55,917 --> 01:26:00,491
"Welcome to prime time, bitch" was not a scripted line.
That was from Ruben.

1359
01:26:00,555 --> 01:26:03,832
That which, you know, was a modification of the original line

1360
01:26:03,892 --> 01:26:05,997
because it didn't quite fit in my mouth, but people love that.

1361
01:26:06,161 --> 01:26:13,136
The one-liners and Robert's delivery of them, made the film,
I think, a little more popular.

1362
01:26:13,201 --> 01:26:15,044
I actually enjoyed that scene

1363
01:26:15,103 --> 01:26:15,877
when they had

1364
01:26:15,937 --> 01:26:20,010
the mechanical arms come out and grab me.

1365
01:26:20,074 --> 01:26:21,644
That <i>was,</i> like, my favorite pan

1366
01:26:21,709 --> 01:26:22,881
just to scream.

1367
01:26:22,944 --> 01:26:24,423
<i>(screaming)</i>

1368
01:26:24,579 --> 01:26:25,887
(laughing) That was great.

1369
01:26:31,452 --> 01:26:34,524
We had to basically make a vacu-form
puppet head that I made.

1370
01:26:34,589 --> 01:26:36,535
It would come out of this TV. We always had to use cut-aways,

1371
01:26:36,591 --> 01:26:40,835
so we'd cut-away and it was Robert's head
sticking through the TV (laughing)

1372
01:26:40,895 --> 01:26:43,000
with antennas on his head. It was pretty hokey.

1373
01:26:43,064 --> 01:26:45,510
People have said that's their favorite death scene

1374
01:26:45,567 --> 01:26:46,409
of the series.

1375
01:26:46,634 --> 01:26:52,141
It's just a great kind of surreal, surreal
"Nightmare on Elm Street" '80s moment.

1376
01:26:52,307 --> 01:26:59,191
Having met his match in the form of the "Dream Warriors,"
Freddy Krueger became even more resourceful in

1377
01:26:59,247 --> 01:27:02,990
finding ways to prey on his victim's darkest fears.

1378
01:27:03,051 --> 01:27:08,763
What "Nightmare on Elm Street Pan 3" did was
it went to the logical conclusion ofhow Freddy

1379
01:27:08,823 --> 01:27:12,327
would operate within your subconcious and haunt you.

1380
01:27:12,393 --> 01:27:15,704
Freddy is in there with those private thoughts, with those

1381
01:27:15,763 --> 01:27:19,643
private fears. He knows what makes you tick.

1382
01:27:19,701 --> 01:27:22,648
He knows what he can use against
you because he gets in there.

1383
01:27:22,704 --> 01:27:24,445
My characters

1384
01:27:24,505 --> 01:27:28,681
weakness was always women and not much has changed.

1385
01:27:28,743 --> 01:27:31,053
One of the more memorable moments from the film is

1386
01:27:31,112 --> 01:27:36,653
the sexy nurse scene where Freddy is using
kind of a sexuality trap in a dream.

1387
01:27:36,718 --> 01:27:42,691
The one character that we spent the most time
interviewing and auditioning was the nurse

1388
01:27:42,757 --> 01:27:44,600
who has to bare her breasts.

1389
01:27:44,659 --> 01:27:52,100
I had to go in and strip, which, you know, isn't easy, but
that was the process. It was a little out of the norm.

1390
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:56,841
She would have to stand there naked and stufffor
the lighting and stuff. It was a pleasure.

1391
01:27:56,904 --> 01:28:01,904
I've had guys tell me, "Watching that scene was the first thing
that really got me interested in girls and you've changed my life."

1392
01:28:08,850 --> 01:28:12,161
That's very ï¬‚attering, and, wow.
That's amazing.

1393
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:17,065
The physical effect of switching the nurse with Freddy was

1394
01:28:17,125 --> 01:28:21,665
something we tried in a makeup effect that got a little too
out of control and it wasn't exactly right.

1395
01:28:21,729 --> 01:28:23,709
What Chuck Russell wanted was

1396
01:28:23,765 --> 01:28:28,043
her to have the head of Freddy and then
have it trail off into this beautiful woman.

1397
01:28:28,102 --> 01:28:29,581
Freddy with breasts,

1398
01:28:29,637 --> 01:28:31,310
it was too ofi-kilter.

1399
01:28:31,372 --> 01:28:33,477
Somehow the imagery was just,

1400
01:28:33,541 --> 01:28:34,451
it didn't quite go.

1401
01:28:34,509 --> 01:28:38,150
Again, this was one of those points that no one
can play Robert like Robert.

1402
01:28:38,212 --> 01:28:43,184
And it just looked like a gin with a Freddy face on,
you know, talking like Robert.

1403
01:28:43,251 --> 01:28:44,252
It just didn't quite work.

1404
01:28:44,319 --> 01:28:45,855
The spitting of the tongues

1405
01:28:45,920 --> 01:28:51,927
was really just a small piece of,
it was like a type of latex that was rolled up.

1406
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:53,904
I would open my mouth and

1407
01:28:53,961 --> 01:28:55,736
do this barking thing.

1408
01:28:55,797 --> 01:28:57,037
The tongues

1409
01:28:57,098 --> 01:28:58,372
were extraordinary.

1410
01:28:58,433 --> 01:29:01,175
You could stand right next to them and look at them

1411
01:29:01,235 --> 01:29:06,048
and the puppeteering was so good that
you couldn't see any phoniness to it whatsoever.

1412
01:29:06,107 --> 01:29:10,249
That was actually shot in a room that they built sideways,

1413
01:29:10,311 --> 01:29:15,283
so I had to climb up on a ladder and be strapped to the bed.

1414
01:29:15,350 --> 01:29:16,954
Standing up.

1415
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:23,094
That's what kills you in a crucifixion. Eventually, your heart
can't pump blood to your extremities, so I

1416
01:29:23,157 --> 01:29:26,798
actually passed out while I was up in this contraption.

1417
01:29:26,861 --> 01:29:31,810
And I also think it's Wnythey hire young actors to be in all
these horror movies, 'cause they can take the abuse.

1418
01:29:31,866 --> 01:29:37,043
The one I remember the most is when
Jennifer Rubin got killed.

1419
01:29:37,105 --> 01:29:39,847
It was kind of the time when punkwas really hot.

1420
01:29:39,907 --> 01:29:43,377
We were developing the character still,
so I hadjust walked up to Chuck Russell and said,

1421
01:29:43,444 --> 01:29:46,084
"Can I do this hairdo?" And he said, "Sure."

1422
01:29:46,147 --> 01:29:47,854
That line that she <i>says,</i>

1423
01:29:47,915 --> 01:29:49,861
"In my dreams, I'm beautiful...

1424
01:29:49,917 --> 01:29:51,828
and bad."

1425
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:56,335
Oh my God, I mean, talk about one of the
worst lines you would ever have to say on film.

1426
01:29:56,391 --> 01:29:58,302
One of the funniest things was

1427
01:29:58,359 --> 01:30:03,035
Taryn was in her full-blown makeup,
we went to a Chinese restaurant for dinner (laughing)

1428
01:30:03,097 --> 01:30:07,136
and it was hysterical, because the way that people
were looking at her, you would've thought that

1429
01:30:07,201 --> 01:30:09,340
she was like an alien from a different world.

1430
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:11,145
She ordered the chop suey with a look in her eyes

1431
01:30:11,205 --> 01:30:13,185
and they backed off. It was very funny.

1432
01:30:13,241 --> 01:30:15,721
I have a little bit of a problem being emotional.

1433
01:30:15,777 --> 01:30:17,188
"Let-s dance."

1434
01:30:17,245 --> 01:30:20,488
lfl get into it, I kind of will try to kill you.

1435
01:30:20,548 --> 01:30:24,086
I remember I did stab him once (laughing)

1436
01:30:24,152 --> 01:30:25,927
when we were really fighting and I got him.

1437
01:30:25,987 --> 01:30:27,330
Track marks on her arms

1438
01:30:27,388 --> 01:30:30,164
turning into sucking little mouths was just brilliant.

1439
01:30:30,224 --> 01:30:32,431
Incredible stuff. Absolutely incredible stuff.

1440
01:30:32,493 --> 01:30:34,097
"Lars <i>get</i> high," <i>(hissing)</i>

1441
01:30:34,162 --> 01:30:35,869
Jennifer Rubin's sequence

1442
01:30:35,930 --> 01:30:38,672
with an exploding head didn't quite make it to film.

1443
01:30:38,733 --> 01:30:44,046
<i>"3, 2, 1. Oh no!" (laughing)</i>

1444
01:30:44,105 --> 01:30:46,244
They didn't figure out how to work

1445
01:30:46,307 --> 01:30:48,184
my special effect.

1446
01:30:48,242 --> 01:30:50,984
Freddy's hypodermic needle fingers

1447
01:30:51,045 --> 01:30:55,585
was my little anti-drug statement that is
very, was very effective.

1448
01:30:55,650 --> 01:30:58,563
I got a lot of fan mail from people

1449
01:30:58,619 --> 01:31:02,533
having quit drugs because of her.
It touch es my heart to be remembered

1450
01:31:02,590 --> 01:31:04,126
that way because

1451
01:31:04,192 --> 01:31:10,404
this girl fights and never says die. But then I had to.

1452
01:31:10,465 --> 01:31:12,877
"I am the Wizard Master!"

1453
01:31:12,934 --> 01:31:14,743
I was a pre-Harry Potter.

1454
01:31:14,802 --> 01:31:18,340
And that <i>was,</i> again, the greatest thing about
my character being a Wizard Master.

1455
01:31:18,406 --> 01:31:23,116
And having played Dungeons & Dragons,
I was able to conjure up the spells.

1456
01:31:23,177 --> 01:31:23,780
That wheelchair

1457
01:31:23,845 --> 01:31:26,553
was huge. And it was so huge,

1458
01:31:26,614 --> 01:31:29,993
it virtually could not get dovlm the hallway.
It had been built too large,

1459
01:31:30,051 --> 01:31:30,722
but it looks

1460
01:31:30,785 --> 01:31:35,564
really frightening when you see it in the film.

1461
01:31:35,623 --> 01:31:36,795
But there was also difficulty

1462
01:31:36,858 --> 01:31:40,135
because Freddy's claws were not retracting,

1463
01:31:40,194 --> 01:31:44,472
so they put a 2-by-4 right by my heart, underneath my cape

1464
01:31:44,532 --> 01:31:49,447
and I was just praying to God that Robert
made sure that he hit it. (screaming)

1465
01:31:49,504 --> 01:31:52,974
I did get to show off who I was and I got to use my power,

1466
01:31:53,040 --> 01:31:57,921
mmich I felt was pretty important, you know,
you get to see exactly what these kids get to do.

1467
01:31:57,979 --> 01:32:01,051
Whether they got killed or not, that's a mmole different story.

1468
01:32:01,115 --> 01:32:06,793
Faced with a grueling production schedule,
diff cult working conditions and an overburdened

1469
01:32:06,854 --> 01:32:12,361
first-time director, tensions on the set of
"Nightmare 3" began to rise.

1470
01:32:12,426 --> 01:32:17,398
Chuck came in with this massive passion,
but what came out of that

1471
01:32:17,465 --> 01:32:19,968
was how difficult it was to work with Chuck. (laughing)

1472
01:32:20,034 --> 01:32:24,505
They were very touchy about the imagery of
Freddy Krueger and where we took it,

1473
01:32:24,572 --> 01:32:29,646
and I was trying to, frankly, loosen them up, you know,
and take it into a crazier place

1474
01:32:29,710 --> 01:32:31,986
and move it further, or there's! be no point.

1475
01:32:32,046 --> 01:32:37,997
He was getting a lot of frustration
from the powers that be over him.

1476
01:32:38,052 --> 01:32:40,862
It was just a really hard shoot.

1477
01:32:40,922 --> 01:32:44,267
I think there was more tension
on that set than any set I've ever been on.

1478
01:32:44,325 --> 01:32:46,134
I think Chuck really had his hands full.

1479
01:32:46,193 --> 01:32:50,039
We were always hours and hours
behind because the stuff was so difficult.

1480
01:32:50,097 --> 01:32:52,373
Lots and lots of effects.

1481
01:32:52,433 --> 01:32:54,140
Diff cult effects.

1482
01:32:54,201 --> 01:32:57,774
Chuck Russell, he was really somebody with
tremendous detail

1483
01:32:57,838 --> 01:33:00,341
with everything. Didn't let anything slide.

1484
01:33:00,408 --> 01:33:09,123
There was a couple of times, for me, that I think Chuck
did not know how speak to some ofus actors.

1485
01:33:09,317 --> 01:33:13,231
I don't think he had a great deal of
experience before doing that film.

1486
01:33:13,287 --> 01:33:16,234
You were aware that there was
this expectation of you

1487
01:33:16,290 --> 01:33:19,533
to do certain things, but you just
didn't really kn ow what they were.

1488
01:33:19,594 --> 01:33:22,097
It was Patricia Arquette's first film and

1489
01:33:22,163 --> 01:33:26,236
the first night that she shot,
we didn't get to her 'til 4 in the morning.

1490
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:27,779
She couldn't remember her lines.

1491
01:33:27,835 --> 01:33:30,577
We did 52 takes with her and still couldn't get it right.

1492
01:33:30,638 --> 01:33:33,517
She just couldn't do it, you know. We had to do cue cards.

1493
01:33:33,574 --> 01:33:36,282
She really rose to the game, but Chuck

1494
01:33:36,344 --> 01:33:39,120
never got over that original discomfort

1495
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:43,094
and never really gave her the support
that I thought that she deserved.

1496
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:49,328
One thing about, I think, maybe any "Elm Street" film
is you're trying to take young performers and get

1497
01:33:49,390 --> 01:33:53,930
<i>'that sense ct tension, get the tear, take them to the edge..</i>

1498
01:33:53,995 --> 01:33:56,737
And it's not an easy kind of film to make.

1499
01:33:56,797 --> 01:34:01,075
The dream set at the end, kind of the climax of the film,

1500
01:34:01,135 --> 01:34:05,550
was kind of an elaborate boiler room set
that was stretching the limits

1501
01:34:05,606 --> 01:34:07,711
for what we could do on budget and time.

1502
01:34:07,775 --> 01:34:11,154
I just remember it was like they, literally, cut

1503
01:34:11,212 --> 01:34:14,193
the air conditioner ofiand it was

1504
01:34:14,248 --> 01:34:16,990
crowded in there, it was hot.

1505
01:34:17,051 --> 01:34:19,657
Those scenes are hard because there's
lots of fire, lots of smoke.

1506
01:34:19,787 --> 01:34:21,323
That smoke smells really bad.

1507
01:34:21,489 --> 01:34:23,696
Always the fire department was

1508
01:34:23,758 --> 01:34:27,729
on our rear end. Always threatening to
close us dovm.

1509
01:34:27,795 --> 01:34:28,865
It was mayhem.

1510
01:34:28,929 --> 01:34:33,537
If we could have photographed behind the scenes
what was happening, it would have been a bigger circus

1511
01:34:33,601 --> 01:34:34,944
than what was in front of the camera.

1512
01:34:35,002 --> 01:34:37,107
And I remember, at one point,

1513
01:34:37,171 --> 01:34:39,811
the tension on the set was so thick

1514
01:34:39,874 --> 01:34:43,720
that one of the producers stopped
the whole shooting and he called

1515
01:34:43,778 --> 01:34:46,384
everybody together and he went to the top of the

1516
01:34:46,447 --> 01:34:50,554
stairs and he said, "This shit is going to stop."

1517
01:34:50,618 --> 01:34:57,558
After the 21st hour one day, I said,
"Chuck, can you define for me what is a director?"

1518
01:34:57,625 --> 01:35:00,333
And he said, "The last man standing."

1519
01:35:00,394 --> 01:35:02,635
And I've never heard a better definition.

1520
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:06,873
We put in long hours, but it was interesting.
Everyone had their hearts in it.

1521
01:35:06,934 --> 01:35:09,710
And I think the results are on the screen.

1522
01:35:09,770 --> 01:35:13,343
The junkyard scene was filmed

1523
01:35:13,407 --> 01:35:18,254
very late at night, early morning.
I think I was there until 3:30 or so.

1524
01:35:18,312 --> 01:35:20,690
The sun almost began coming up.

1525
01:35:20,748 --> 01:35:24,195
Frank Darabont, who co-m/rote that script with me,
and I are both

1526
01:35:24,251 --> 01:35:26,288
big Ray Harryhausen fans, so we found

1527
01:35:26,353 --> 01:35:28,833
a way to get our little homage

1528
01:35:28,889 --> 01:35:30,459
to Harryhausen with

1529
01:35:30,524 --> 01:35:31,935
bringing Freddy's skeleton to life.

1530
01:35:32,026 --> 01:35:35,303
We decided to build a skeleton and found how diff cult it was

1531
01:35:35,362 --> 01:35:37,899
to build a stop-motion skeleton.

1532
01:35:37,965 --> 01:35:40,104
I wish he'd had Ray there because

1533
01:35:40,167 --> 01:35:42,010
maybe we could have done a better job of it.

1534
01:35:42,069 --> 01:35:44,640
We used Robert Englund's attitude,

1535
01:35:44,705 --> 01:35:49,450
his posture and stuff for the Freddy skeleton
as much as we could so it looked like him.

1536
01:35:49,510 --> 01:35:54,289
I don't remember how they did it, but they
must have put me on some sort of a dolly

1537
01:35:54,348 --> 01:35:59,559
going toward this Cadillac fender in the back,

1538
01:35:59,620 --> 01:36:02,191
the tail which pierced me.

1539
01:36:02,256 --> 01:36:04,600
I must say I didn't like the scene.

1540
01:36:04,658 --> 01:36:06,137
"3" was the first time when you see the souls

1541
01:36:06,193 --> 01:36:10,699
of children. This is an effect where all the souls
that are trapped inside of Freddy make

1542
01:36:10,765 --> 01:36:12,438
an appearance on his body.

1543
01:36:12,500 --> 01:36:15,606
The screaming souls on Freddy's chest was something that

1544
01:36:15,669 --> 01:36:19,674
we didn't really know we could pull off,
but that particular effect

1545
01:36:19,740 --> 01:36:23,779
actually is a quite haunting, strange
concept that worked well.

1546
01:36:23,844 --> 01:36:28,691
It was actually a chest piece that fit under Robert's
own chest. It was about 3 inches thick and inside

1547
01:36:28,749 --> 01:36:33,664
there were cables that came out the back of him and all that.
And they blinked the eyes and moved the jaws and all that stuff.

1548
01:36:33,721 --> 01:36:35,701
"It's a dead end."

1549
01:36:35,756 --> 01:36:38,532
One of the very toughest things, strangely, was

1550
01:36:38,592 --> 01:36:40,799
the mirror sequence, the mirror hallway.

1551
01:36:40,861 --> 01:36:42,966
My character screams and

1552
01:36:43,030 --> 01:36:44,805
breaks all the mirrors and

1553
01:36:44,865 --> 01:36:48,574
it turns out that my dream power is my voice.

1554
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:52,083
Mirrors shattering in that hallway was a really huge effect.

1555
01:36:52,239 --> 01:36:55,846
And this is before CGI, so we had to get very inventive.

1556
01:36:55,910 --> 01:36:59,255
I mean, unbelievably technically diff cult.

1557
01:36:59,313 --> 01:37:03,955
It was something we ended up getting done
at the optical house, at the last minute,

1558
01:37:04,018 --> 01:37:07,124
literally manipulating mylar in front of a camera.

1559
01:37:07,188 --> 01:37:10,397
That sequence and where Freddy gets blown apart

1560
01:37:10,457 --> 01:37:12,562
were two very, very complicated sequences.

1561
01:37:12,626 --> 01:37:13,969
We had to build this puppet head

1562
01:37:14,028 --> 01:37:15,473
<i>'and this 'make thing was mechanical.</i>

1563
01:37:15,529 --> 01:37:17,008
And then, later, the guys, the optical guys, went in there

1564
01:37:17,064 --> 01:37:20,511
and rotoscoped light pouring out of him
and that's how he sort of just tore apart

1565
01:37:20,568 --> 01:37:22,639
with the light of God.

1566
01:37:22,703 --> 01:37:25,115
They had to bury Freddy in the hallowed ground,
that made sense.

1567
01:37:25,172 --> 01:37:28,153
And so Chuck understood sort of the
religious connotations and things like that.

1568
01:37:28,209 --> 01:37:29,552
I wanted to bring in these kind of

1569
01:37:29,610 --> 01:37:34,889
classic Christian values almost.
We kill Freddy with a cross.

1570
01:37:34,949 --> 01:37:37,987
I mean, this is old school vampire stuff.

1571
01:37:38,052 --> 01:37:41,898
"Nightmare on Elm Street 2" <i>was,</i> I guess,
the gayest horrorfilm ever made and

1572
01:37:41,956 --> 01:37:44,334
"Nightmare on Elm Street 3" was the Christian version.

1573
01:37:44,391 --> 01:37:49,170
I think in doing the third one I knew
we had to fill in a little bit of the Freddy backstory.

1574
01:37:49,230 --> 01:37:54,646
And in the "Elm Street" series that means
it has to be something big and dangerous.

1575
01:37:54,702 --> 01:37:55,942
I love the idea that

1576
01:37:56,003 --> 01:38:00,975
some twisted DNA somehow made
its way into this poor little nun,

1577
01:38:01,041 --> 01:38:05,615
Amanda Krueger, who got the Christmas shifi
in the asylum, getting raped by a hundred maniacs.

1578
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:06,248
"Freddy?!"

1579
01:38:06,614 --> 01:38:10,926
"The bastard son of a hundred maniacs."

1580
01:38:10,985 --> 01:38:16,298
And this was just one of the ideas that came out
that we realized was appropriate,

1581
01:38:16,357 --> 01:38:19,167
but, in a way, dangerous to put on film.

1582
01:38:19,226 --> 01:38:23,641
It's always a balancing act between
how much you're going to reveal the monster

1583
01:38:23,697 --> 01:38:26,303
and how much you're going to keep mysterious.

1584
01:38:26,367 --> 01:38:33,046
V\ï¬‚th his dark history revealed and his bones laid to rest,
the time had come for Freddy's final reckoning.

1585
01:38:33,107 --> 01:38:39,456
But if Krueger had to go, he would take with him
one of Elm Street's finest.

1586
01:38:39,513 --> 01:38:40,491
"Die!"

1587
01:38:40,547 --> 01:38:42,458
Heather being killed offis not that unusual.

1588
01:38:42,516 --> 01:38:47,693
If the original characters were in the sequel,
usually they didn't last until the end because

1589
01:38:47,755 --> 01:38:52,363
they either aged or the studio would feel like
now we have to have new characters.

1590
01:38:52,426 --> 01:38:56,932
I do believe that it's very appropriate that
Nancy dies at the end of

1591
01:38:56,997 --> 01:39:00,968
It's almost like killing a recurring character
or a regular off of a television <i>show,</i>

1592
01:39:01,035 --> 01:39:02,708
and it takes some courage.

1593
01:39:02,770 --> 01:39:06,912
Her dying off was in the original screenplay

1594
01:39:06,974 --> 01:39:08,851
and it was a bold thing to do.

1595
01:39:08,909 --> 01:39:11,856
She goes out heroically, which is, I think, very fitting.

1596
01:39:11,912 --> 01:39:15,359
All stories of heroes have to come to an end and

1597
01:39:15,416 --> 01:39:20,297
I thought that the way that she died
in Patricia's arms was very touching.

1598
01:39:20,354 --> 01:39:24,700
But I knew it would in crease kind of the
whole suspense and jeopardy.

1599
01:39:24,758 --> 01:39:27,534
If Nancy can die, anything can happen in the series.

1600
01:39:27,594 --> 01:39:31,474
Now that Krueger had been vanquished,
at least for the moment,

1601
01:39:31,532 --> 01:39:36,003
the filmmakers wanted to find a way to
market Freddy to the masses.

1602
01:39:36,070 --> 01:39:39,916
There is something naturally heavy metal
about Freddy Krueger.

1603
01:39:39,974 --> 01:39:43,888
And there was a sudden opportunity to use Dokken.

1604
01:39:43,944 --> 01:39:48,017
I just moved out fiom Tampa, Florida.All I knew was Dokken.

1605
01:39:48,082 --> 01:39:51,928
Doing the movie was kind of like ourwhole career:
50% talent, 50% luck.

1606
01:39:51,986 --> 01:39:58,494
It was specific. It had to be called "Dream Warriors" and try
to make it spooky and the lyrics should be about the movie.

1607
01:39:58,559 --> 01:40:00,732
I still remember my version -- it didn't make it.

1608
01:40:00,794 --> 01:40:04,469
Mine was (singing), "Dream warriors,
we can be heroes inside of our dreams."

1609
01:40:04,531 --> 01:40:07,910
Which <i>is exactly why</i> it <i>didn't get accepted. (laughing)
That's how</i> it <i>went, yeah. (laughing)</i>

1610
01:40:07,968 --> 01:40:10,005
The Dokken video was kind of ahead of its time.

1611
01:40:10,070 --> 01:40:15,816
We were at the eany end of MTV and it was
kind of the perfect opportunity to take

1612
01:40:15,876 --> 01:40:18,117
heavy metal and horror and make one

1613
01:40:18,178 --> 01:40:19,782
nasty thing out of it.

1614
01:40:19,847 --> 01:40:21,918
It was cutting edge, you know.
Nobody had done it

1615
01:40:21,982 --> 01:40:25,293
and we were like the first band to do that,
you know, all that stuff and mix it with the movie.

1616
01:40:25,352 --> 01:40:27,059
I thought it was the greatest video.

1617
01:40:27,121 --> 01:40:30,193
It really helped our careers.
And, in fact, ours was the first video

1618
01:40:30,257 --> 01:40:33,329
ever included on a VHS of a movie. First one.

1619
01:40:33,394 --> 01:40:34,737
I can't sing the song anymore.

1620
01:40:34,795 --> 01:40:37,298
(singing) "...forever."

1621
01:40:37,364 --> 01:40:38,274
It's so high.

1622
01:40:38,332 --> 01:40:42,337
Even vmen I did it and I was young --
I was probably SO-something, in my eany 30s --

1623
01:40:42,403 --> 01:40:43,404
it just was too frickin' high.

1624
01:40:43,670 --> 01:40:45,013
(singing) "Dream warriors"

1625
01:40:45,072 --> 01:40:49,953
(singing) "We're the dream warriors...

1626
01:40:50,010 --> 01:40:53,014
(singing)"Don't want to dream no more."

1627
01:40:53,080 --> 01:41:00,658
(singing) "And maybe tonight, maybe tonight
you'll be gone. Dream warriors."

1628
01:41:00,721 --> 01:41:03,201
I have a platinum record from that Dokken song.

1629
01:41:03,257 --> 01:41:05,737
That is one of the few prop things that's
actually up in my house

1630
01:41:05,793 --> 01:41:09,605
because it's so funny that I could
possibly have a platinum record ever

1631
01:41:09,663 --> 01:41:10,869
with my mmite, Jewish rhythm.

1632
01:41:10,931 --> 01:41:13,673
I've never gone anywnere, or performed anywhere,

1633
01:41:13,734 --> 01:41:18,808
any of us, where we either don't see the EP
or an album, or get asked to do the song.

1634
01:41:18,872 --> 01:41:21,409
It's just part of our legacy.

1635
01:41:25,045 --> 01:41:27,286
"What a nightmare!"

1636
01:41:27,848 --> 01:41:34,959
"Dream Warriors" was released on February 27, 1987.
Aimed straight at the mainstream, "Nightmare 3"

1637
01:41:35,022 --> 01:41:38,936
paved the way for Freddy Kruegerto become
a household name.

1638
01:41:38,992 --> 01:41:44,340
I felt like, honestly, it couldn't be more frightening than
what Wes did in the original, but I thought adding an element

1639
01:41:44,398 --> 01:41:50,815
of wit and black humor would balance out
some of the really dark imagery in the piece.

1640
01:41:50,871 --> 01:41:55,479
The fact that they made Freddy more and more jokey,
took him farther and farther away fiom that child molester thing

1641
01:41:55,542 --> 01:41:57,954
that just kind of sticks to you in a way maybe you don't like.

1642
01:41:58,011 --> 01:42:02,585
I think there's a great combination between horror and humor.
And it always goes that way,

1643
01:42:02,649 --> 01:42:04,526
it doesn't matter how scary your first film is.

1644
01:42:04,585 --> 01:42:11,799
They really walked a fine line with it.
It was never cheesy or campy, it was always with a purpose.

1645
01:42:11,959 --> 01:42:16,959
It's why "3" was a little bit of a surprise for the series and for the
fans and I think maybe hard to get exactly right after that.

1646
01:42:22,803 --> 01:42:26,717
There's only so much you can do with Freddy's comedy
before it becomes too much.

1647
01:42:26,907 --> 01:42:33,085
After "2" there were not a lot of people that really thought
that it was going to be successful.

1648
01:42:33,147 --> 01:42:37,562
<i>So</i> it <i>was really up to Chuck to make</i> it <i>successful,
and I think he made</i> it <i>successful.</i>

1649
01:42:37,618 --> 01:42:43,364
"For the very first time in history, a small, independent film
has swept the weekend box office grosses."

1650
01:42:43,423 --> 01:42:49,567
"The number one movie in the country last week. In Syracuse they
called in the mounted police to control the crowds at theaters."

1651
01:42:49,863 --> 01:42:53,367
It was in the Top 10 grossers of the year that it came out.

1652
01:42:53,567 --> 01:42:55,069
That movie made a lot of money.

1653
01:42:55,569 --> 01:42:59,881
Seeing the audiences respond to it,
seeing the series become so successful

1654
01:42:59,940 --> 01:43:02,352
from that point on, was my payoff.

1655
01:43:02,409 --> 01:43:04,889
"Nightmare on Elm Street" went from being cult

1656
01:43:04,945 --> 01:43:08,415
to being an international, huge success.

1657
01:43:08,482 --> 01:43:12,760
"The worst!" "Don't leave
home without it!" (laughing)

1658
01:43:13,020 --> 01:43:16,467
When Siskel and Ebert reviewed the film

1659
01:43:16,523 --> 01:43:26,137
they got into a heated debate on the show and
Roger Ebert was very adamant that he felt like the film

1660
01:43:26,200 --> 01:43:27,975
deserved an "X" rating.

1661
01:43:28,035 --> 01:43:35,510
<i>Considering his movie is being pitched to teenagers and young teenagers. Don't talk
to me about the "R" rating, they know exactly who they want to see this movie."</i>

1662
01:43:35,576 --> 01:43:37,453
<i>'(shattered glass)'</i>

1663
01:43:37,511 --> 01:43:43,484
I have to say that over the years and having met
lots of fans all over the world, that I think

1664
01:43:43,550 --> 01:43:45,860
the fan favorite is "Nightmare on Elm Street Pan 3."

1665
01:43:46,253 --> 01:43:48,699
I mean, more of my fans say they like that movie
than any of them.

1666
01:43:49,156 --> 01:43:53,627
"Dream Warriors" is what the best franchise
sequels in any genre should be, because

1667
01:43:53,694 --> 01:44:00,111
it's a film that moves the franchise along,
adds to the mythology without taking anything auvay from

1668
01:44:00,167 --> 01:44:05,082
what's come before, and also manages --
and it is a very hard thing to do --

1669
01:44:05,138 --> 01:44:06,674
to maintain or reintroduce

1670
01:44:06,740 --> 01:44:10,552
characters that we already know and
care about while balancing them with new characters

1671
01:44:10,611 --> 01:44:13,057
that we ultimately actually care about just the same.

1672
01:44:13,113 --> 01:44:17,721
There were some successful "Elm Streets" after it
and some not so successful. But they were all,

1673
01:44:17,784 --> 01:44:19,923
from that point on, I think more imaginative.

1674
01:44:19,987 --> 01:44:24,766
We started getting into the groove, so to speak,
and everybody was wailing with ideas.

1675
01:44:24,825 --> 01:44:26,600
All the elements that worked in that

1676
01:44:26,660 --> 01:44:30,335
I was instrumental in trying to feed into the next scripts.

1677
01:44:30,397 --> 01:44:32,604
And I think we set the tone for the other sequels.

1678
01:44:46,413 --> 01:44:53,353
After "Dream Warriors," Freddy's audience expanded
far beyond expectations and New Line Cinema,

1679
01:44:53,420 --> 01:44:57,368
like Freddy Krueger himself,
began growing by leaps and bounds.

1680
01:44:57,724 --> 01:45:01,399
By this time "Nightmare" had a reputation
and New Line had a reputation.

1681
01:45:01,862 --> 01:45:04,968
The company was really evolving into

1682
01:45:05,032 --> 01:45:07,706
less of an unstable

1683
01:45:07,768 --> 01:45:09,042
and uncertain entity,

1684
01:45:09,102 --> 01:45:10,604
into one that was very financeable.

1685
01:45:11,004 --> 01:45:15,146
Bob was very good at promoting.
I mean, in a way that Roger Corman did the same thing.

1686
01:45:15,208 --> 01:45:19,020
He was very good at promoting people who he thought
were smart and he thought supported the company.

1687
01:45:19,079 --> 01:45:20,319
He was building an empire,

1688
01:45:20,380 --> 01:45:22,382
he wasn'tjust making movies.

1689
01:45:22,449 --> 01:45:25,828
That was the New Line way. lfth ey liked you,
they lefi you alone.

1690
01:45:25,886 --> 01:45:29,834
They worked the crap off of you and
they didn't pay you a lot, but you knew

1691
01:45:29,890 --> 01:45:31,267
you were doing their next movie.

1692
01:45:31,325 --> 01:45:33,669
So if you got on that New Line boat,

1693
01:45:33,727 --> 01:45:35,297
that was a good ship to be sailing on.

1694
01:45:35,829 --> 01:45:39,538
The way I got involved in "Nightmare on Elm Street 4" was

1695
01:45:39,599 --> 01:45:42,307
very unusual and very complicated.

1696
01:45:42,369 --> 01:45:48,809
We had our pick really of directors, but, again,
we wanted young, hot, up-and-coming, cheap.

1697
01:45:49,009 --> 01:45:50,579
I had come

1698
01:45:50,644 --> 01:45:53,591
from Finland a few years prior to seek my fortune.

1699
01:45:53,647 --> 01:45:55,024
He and his pal were living out of

1700
01:45:55,082 --> 01:45:58,495
baked bean cans in a single room
in Hollywood somewhere.

1701
01:45:58,552 --> 01:46:02,295
I'd lost all my credit cards, all my money,
I was really down on my luck.

1702
01:46:02,489 --> 01:46:04,332
I had seen the movie he made.

1703
01:46:04,391 --> 01:46:05,870
I think it was called "Prison."

1704
01:46:05,926 --> 01:46:07,872
It was made for about $1 million

1705
01:46:07,928 --> 01:46:10,238
and it had a lot of sort of homemade special effects.

1706
01:46:10,297 --> 01:46:14,404
I knew he would be great.
I met with him, I thought he was fantastic.

1707
01:46:14,468 --> 01:46:17,813
And after fifteen minutes Bob Shaye's like,
"Okay, goodbye."

1708
01:46:17,871 --> 01:46:20,181
And he pretty much throws me out of his ofï¬‚ce.

1709
01:46:20,240 --> 01:46:26,486
Bob kept saying, "He doesn't speak English." (laughing)
He said, "It's not his main language."

1710
01:46:26,546 --> 01:46:30,289
I went five times back to New Line,
pretty much unannounced.

1711
01:46:30,350 --> 01:46:35,322
I didn't, you know, call an assistant and make an appointment,
I just would go and hang out in the lobby and

1712
01:46:35,389 --> 01:46:40,134
go to Bob Sh eye's office and say, "Hi, I'm back."
And he's like, "The Finnish guy? What is he doing here?"

1713
01:46:40,193 --> 01:46:43,868
And every time he'd come in for an interview he looked, frankly,

1714
01:46:43,930 --> 01:46:47,810
dirtier and dirtier and he'd wear the same clothes. And I

1715
01:46:47,868 --> 01:46:50,872
really think they started to smell.

1716
01:46:50,937 --> 01:46:52,143
He was like a Viking, you know,

1717
01:46:52,205 --> 01:46:54,685
this guy's huge. He had hair down to his ass.

1718
01:46:54,741 --> 01:46:58,018
And I thought, "God, I've got to hire this guy
just to get him a bath."

1719
01:46:58,178 --> 01:47:03,594
We needed a director desperately and I knew it was
going to be a huge amount of work and

1720
01:47:03,650 --> 01:47:05,596
we decided, he's a big guy, you know (laughing)

1721
01:47:05,652 --> 01:47:10,431
he probably has a lot o energy and he can work really
hard 24 hours a day for six weeks to get the film ready.

1722
01:47:10,490 --> 01:47:15,906
So they kind of compromised and finally said, like,
"Okay, you won us over. You can direct the movie."

1723
01:47:15,962 --> 01:47:20,934
I was very scared stepping into this movie.
It was my first sort of a Hollywood movie and

1724
01:47:21,001 --> 01:47:25,472
though it was only a $5 million budget,
for me it was gigantic.

1725
01:47:25,539 --> 01:47:28,748
Brian Helgeland wrote "Nightmare 4"

1726
01:47:28,809 --> 01:47:33,087
and he was another hot, young,
up-and-coming writer that we could afford.

1727
01:47:33,146 --> 01:47:38,789
There was sort of a rough script, but a very,
very sort of like a blueprint for the movie.

1728
01:47:38,852 --> 01:47:42,129
And sooner than we knew, the writers' strike started.

1729
01:47:42,189 --> 01:47:45,068
"Nightmare 4" was just this writers' disaster.

1730
01:47:45,125 --> 01:47:50,097
So a lot of it was really made up,
because we had no writer to write it.

1731
01:47:50,163 --> 01:47:54,339
Mostly I would come up with the nightmares
because I had an endless amount of nightmares

1732
01:47:54,401 --> 01:47:55,903
in my memories from my childhood.

1733
01:47:56,102 --> 01:48:02,075
He knew that he had to make the film more visual
and he had to up those stakes because

1734
01:48:02,142 --> 01:48:03,450
we didn't have as strong a script.

1735
01:48:03,610 --> 01:48:09,060
What I felt was very important was to
sort of reinvent the series.

1736
01:48:09,115 --> 01:48:12,221
From the very get-go I said,
"I feel that Freddy has sort of become

1737
01:48:12,285 --> 01:48:15,095
like James Bond of horror films

1738
01:48:15,155 --> 01:48:18,364
and we should make him, in a way,
the hero of the movie."

1739
01:48:18,425 --> 01:48:21,235
We saw a movie before the movie was made,
which was called

1740
01:48:21,294 --> 01:48:24,275
"Chinese Ghost Story."
We were inspired by the feel of it.

1741
01:48:24,498 --> 01:48:28,913
And this movie was really meant to be done in that

1742
01:48:28,969 --> 01:48:33,042
Hung Kong action style,
which is a lot of quick cuts, a lot of different shots.

1743
01:48:33,306 --> 01:48:37,880
Renny was like ahead of everybody on that film.

1744
01:48:37,944 --> 01:48:41,357
He totally understood the youth culture,
he was young himself.

1745
01:48:41,414 --> 01:48:43,917
He completely understood how to make the script work.

1746
01:48:44,084 --> 01:48:47,725
Looking to preserve the continuity of the previous film

1747
01:48:47,787 --> 01:48:49,289
<i>Renny Hamâ€œ sought out a new cast'</i>

1748
01:48:49,356 --> 01:48:52,565
of likeable young actors to team up with the last

1749
01:48:52,626 --> 01:48:54,333
of the "Elm Street" children.

1750
01:48:54,394 --> 01:49:01,209
The casting of the movie was an interesting process.
I wanted to see really ï¬‚'esh faces in the film,

1751
01:49:01,268 --> 01:49:03,145
people that nobody had seen before.

1752
01:49:03,203 --> 01:49:06,650
"Alice is not especially well put together.
And yet there's something about this

1753
01:49:06,706 --> 01:49:12,657
shy-loooking girl that suggests that
she might be incredibly attractive if she had any confidence."

1754
01:49:12,712 --> 01:49:16,489
I was that gin. I uvas that shy girl.
I thought I would never have a boyfriend.

1755
01:49:16,550 --> 01:49:19,861
Alice was a daydreamer,
that was mmere she felt most comfortable.

1756
01:49:19,920 --> 01:49:22,992
In her mind, imagining being with the hunky Dan.

1757
01:49:23,256 --> 01:49:27,432
"Alice's attention drifts to a tough pick-up
that is pulling up not far from them.

1758
01:49:27,494 --> 01:49:30,532
A handsome, dark-haired teenager,
Dan, climbs out of the car."

1759
01:49:30,597 --> 01:49:35,307
Well, they made a joke, because they
gave me the pan pretty eany on and the script-

1760
01:49:35,368 --> 01:49:38,542
I don't know if his name was Dan - they were like,
"Just call him Dan, that'll work."

1761
01:49:38,605 --> 01:49:42,075
At first I <i>was,</i> like, man, these guys think
I'm so bad, they're giving me

1762
01:49:42,142 --> 01:49:43,678
my own name so I answer to it. (laughing)

1763
01:49:43,843 --> 01:49:50,283
I didn't know I was going to be in the
film until my agent called and

1764
01:49:50,350 --> 01:49:54,821
told me there was a script for "Nightmare on Elm Street 4"
and I was in it.

1765
01:49:54,888 --> 01:49:59,962
They forgot to kill me in "Pan 3" so that's why
they brought me back in "Part 4." (laughing)

1766
01:50:00,026 --> 01:50:02,529
Oh, they let the black man live? (laughing)

1767
01:50:02,596 --> 01:50:04,303
We'll fiX that.

1768
01:50:04,364 --> 01:50:10,576
I would tell my friends, "If you're going to the movie
to see me in "Part 4," go straight to the theaters,

1769
01:50:10,637 --> 01:50:15,882
don't get no popcorn, don't get no drinks or nothin',
'cause my ass will be dead by the time you sit down."

1770
01:50:16,042 --> 01:50:20,149
I remember our disappointment in "Nightmare 4"
that we couldn't get Patricia Arquette.

1771
01:50:20,213 --> 01:50:25,629
She had been such an integral pan to "Nightmare 3"
and people liked her so much.

1772
01:50:25,685 --> 01:50:31,567
I'm not 100% sure why Patricia Arquette did not return.

1773
01:50:31,791 --> 01:50:34,965
To this day, I don't know why.

1774
01:50:35,028 --> 01:50:39,602
I don't think there's any untoward reason,
I think maybe she was busy.

1775
01:50:39,666 --> 01:50:43,113
Patricia was already starring in other movies then

1776
01:50:43,169 --> 01:50:44,944
and it just simply may have been a conï¬‚ict.

1777
01:50:45,005 --> 01:50:45,847
Maybe her agents

1778
01:50:45,905 --> 01:50:49,546
wanted too much money and Bob Shaye
didn't want to pay and said, you know,

1779
01:50:49,609 --> 01:50:51,850
Bob Shays-style, "Screw you."

1780
01:50:51,911 --> 01:51:00,922
They just wouldn't pay her the money that she asked for, and
it was very little and definitely what she deserved.

1781
01:51:01,121 --> 01:51:06,161
"Kristen, a beautiful, but pensive-looking blonde teenager,

1782
01:51:06,226 --> 01:51:09,673
is walking slowiy towards the ominous house."

1783
01:51:09,729 --> 01:51:11,800
I think stepping into that role

1784
01:51:11,865 --> 01:51:16,075
at first I was nervous, 'cause I'm like,
"I'm not Kristen. Oh no."

1785
01:51:16,136 --> 01:51:17,274
You know, "I'm not Patricia Arquette."

1786
01:51:17,437 --> 01:51:24,218
The chemistry between Tuesday Knight was not as great

1787
01:51:24,277 --> 01:51:26,655
as it was with Patricia Arquette.

1788
01:51:26,713 --> 01:51:27,088
"Hi guys."

1789
01:51:27,247 --> 01:51:30,353
It was quite difficult to do a scene

1790
01:51:30,417 --> 01:51:34,024
that was a heartfelt reunion on the page

1791
01:51:34,087 --> 01:51:36,795
with somebody I hadn't worked before.

1792
01:51:36,856 --> 01:51:42,397
I would have loved to have seen what that movie
could have become had Patricia Arquette participated in it.

1793
01:51:42,629 --> 01:51:47,874
We ran into Jim Cameron, so Renny's quite
excited and he introduces himself

1794
01:51:47,934 --> 01:51:54,180
and Jim <i>says,</i> "Well, <i>so</i> how are you resurrecting Freddy this
time?" And Rennyjust looks at him and goes,

1795
01:51:54,240 --> 01:51:57,380
"A dog pisses fire."

1796
01:51:57,577 --> 01:52:03,357
Renny was really the one who
did the mmole dog pee thing to resurrect Freddy,

1797
01:52:03,550 --> 01:52:04,995
mmich <i>was,</i> what a great way, right?

1798
01:52:05,051 --> 01:52:06,530
Someone just pees on it,

1799
01:52:06,586 --> 01:52:07,929
he's back.

1800
01:52:07,987 --> 01:52:11,400
I'm a dog lover, so it just came naturally, this whole dog idea.

1801
01:52:11,558 --> 01:52:13,629
Because it is an animal

1802
01:52:13,693 --> 01:52:14,637
and another animal

1803
01:52:14,694 --> 01:52:16,469
together with the pee.

1804
01:52:16,529 --> 01:52:17,405
It's lovely.

1805
01:52:17,464 --> 01:52:19,375
It comes out beautiful when you do it that way.

1806
01:52:19,532 --> 01:52:22,513
That's some strong pee.

1807
01:52:22,569 --> 01:52:25,015
(laughing) He had a urine infection like hell.

1808
01:52:25,171 --> 01:52:31,952
I think that a dog peeing on Freddy is, you know,
again it's mythic. It's like, if you start to examine that

1809
01:52:32,011 --> 01:52:34,855
and you want to be intellectual,
it's a hound from hell.

1810
01:52:34,914 --> 01:52:37,588
Freddy come back, why you runnin'?
Piss on his ass.

1811
01:52:37,650 --> 01:52:40,824
"Hows this for a wet dream?"

1812
01:52:40,887 --> 01:52:46,860
The sequence that was maybe one of the
more challenging ones was the water bed sequence.

1813
01:52:46,926 --> 01:52:49,964
I really did appreciate my death scene,

1814
01:52:50,029 --> 01:52:53,670
and again, at the hands of a beautiful naked woman.

1815
01:52:53,733 --> 01:52:55,041
Always my weakness.

1816
01:52:55,101 --> 01:52:58,446
That bedroom was built on about a 4 foot high

1817
01:52:58,505 --> 01:53:00,348
platform with

1818
01:53:00,406 --> 01:53:03,979
a water tank that was the actual water bed.

1819
01:53:04,210 --> 01:53:09,717
Very complicated. I don't know how we pulled it off.
And it was one of those scenes where

1820
01:53:09,783 --> 01:53:10,557
everybody was getting fiustrated.

1821
01:53:10,683 --> 01:53:16,292
"It's like 20-something takes. You guys have been shooting this
for 6 fucking hours. if you can't get it, it's your problem."

1822
01:53:16,489 --> 01:53:22,735
There was definitely tension on the set on that day,
but in the end it worked out perfectly.

1823
01:53:22,929 --> 01:53:31,110
Ken and Tuesday and I were the last of
the "Elm Street" children and to just sort of summarily

1824
01:53:31,171 --> 01:53:32,946
wipe us out

1825
01:53:33,006 --> 01:53:33,984
at the beginning

1826
01:53:34,040 --> 01:53:35,417
of "Pan 4"

1827
01:53:35,475 --> 01:53:37,751
just felt like a real sort of cheap trick.

1828
01:53:37,911 --> 01:53:42,018
What were we going to say, you know?
We're going to go up to Bob Shaye and say,

1829
01:53:42,081 --> 01:53:44,288
"Look, we want to be in the whole movie."

1830
01:53:44,484 --> 01:53:46,623
it was on page 11 , I think is when he got rid of me.

1831
01:53:46,820 --> 01:53:48,731
Should've got rid of me on page 2.

1832
01:53:48,888 --> 01:53:52,836
Kristen's death scene was kind of bizarre.

1833
01:53:52,892 --> 01:53:55,839
There was a beautiful beach,
palm trees and all that, and she's

1834
01:53:55,895 --> 01:53:57,340
suntanning herself there

1835
01:53:57,397 --> 01:53:58,569
and Freddy turns into a shark.

1836
01:53:58,765 --> 01:54:03,236
Renny wanted my bathing suits to be like the size of a,

1837
01:54:03,303 --> 01:54:05,374
like string, so I put it on and go,

1838
01:54:05,438 --> 01:54:11,320
"There's no way that I'm coming out like this. There's no way."
And he goes, "Oh Tuesday, your buttocks looks beautiful.

1839
01:54:11,377 --> 01:54:11,912
You come out like that."

1840
01:54:12,078 --> 01:54:18,256
And I want to get this shot and I get really pissed off at Tuesday,
I'm like, "Come on," you know. And she's like, "I can't, I can't."

1841
01:54:18,418 --> 01:54:20,659
I'm like, "No, I'm not coming out!"

1842
01:54:20,720 --> 01:54:24,759
"No, no, it's beautiful. No, it brings love."

1843
01:54:24,824 --> 01:54:29,705
It's not because I'm some, you know, sex pervert,
but I know what teenage boys want to watch.

1844
01:54:29,863 --> 01:54:31,171
So they had to sew

1845
01:54:31,231 --> 01:54:34,303
a little thing. That's why I had that little Hawaiian job.

1846
01:54:34,367 --> 01:54:36,404
I do remember that just to stay with

1847
01:54:36,469 --> 01:54:39,916
the sort of superhero concept with Freddy,

1848
01:54:39,973 --> 01:54:41,611
I said, "Let's give him sunglasses."

1849
01:54:41,674 --> 01:54:44,052
Almost like now he's like Tom Cruise.

1850
01:54:44,110 --> 01:54:47,614
Which was again, it was kind of like
against all the rules of the "Nightmare" movies.

1851
01:54:47,680 --> 01:54:49,523
After that, we cut to the scene where, you know, I'm

1852
01:54:51,084 --> 01:54:52,256
in the big fight With him

1853
01:54:52,318 --> 01:54:53,854
and so, I mean,

1854
01:54:53,920 --> 01:54:55,126
<i>'she does sort of go down in sort of'</i>

1855
01:54:55,188 --> 01:54:55,723
a blaze of glory.

1856
01:54:55,889 --> 01:54:58,369
It's kind of too late for her, but then she does pass it on

1857
01:54:58,424 --> 01:54:59,300
to Alice.

1858
01:54:59,459 --> 01:55:05,432
Alice did take on the qualities of her friends
as they were killed.

1859
01:55:05,598 --> 01:55:09,478
You could really see that arc in the character
in the course of the movie.

1860
01:55:09,535 --> 01:55:13,347
Somebody I could make seem timid and
vulnerable in the beginning

1861
01:55:13,406 --> 01:55:17,411
and who can then, in a believable way,
become kind of like

1862
01:55:17,477 --> 01:55:19,616
Sigourney Weaver in "Aliens"
or something like that.

1863
01:55:19,779 --> 01:55:26,663
Poor Lisa. I just remember her being so shiny
and they were always, always powdering her

1864
01:55:26,719 --> 01:55:28,824
because she was exerting so much energy because she

1865
01:55:28,888 --> 01:55:30,492
was so physical in that one.

1866
01:55:30,556 --> 01:55:31,694
They did send me

1867
01:55:31,758 --> 01:55:33,362
off to a day of karate school.

1868
01:55:33,426 --> 01:55:35,804
I was terrified I was going to hit myself
in the head with nunchucks.

1869
01:55:35,862 --> 01:55:38,468
And I've heard this comment so many,
it's like, "The wig was so bad,

1870
01:55:38,531 --> 01:55:39,373
it doesn't even look like

1871
01:55:39,432 --> 01:55:40,638
Alice from the back."

1872
01:55:40,700 --> 01:55:43,840
That's all acting, you know,
'cause she's really kind of

1873
01:55:43,903 --> 01:55:45,746
like a femme fatale in real life.

1874
01:55:45,805 --> 01:55:50,811
Your villain, to put a ï¬‚ip on a famous adage,
is only as good as his hero. And when we look at

1875
01:55:50,877 --> 01:55:54,415
the best of these franchises, be it "Dream Warriors"
or "The Dream Master,"

1876
01:55:54,480 --> 01:55:56,482
in which case he fighting against a capable hero,

1877
01:55:56,549 --> 01:55:58,620
those are the ones the fans generally like the best.

1878
01:55:58,685 --> 01:56:05,694
"Nightmare 3" and "Nightmare 4" has been
the highest making movies. I ain't braggin'

1879
01:56:05,758 --> 01:56:07,533
but those were the two I was in.

1880
01:56:07,694 --> 01:56:11,039
One of the cool things about "Nightmare 4"
is it's sort of a who's who of makeup effects.

1881
01:56:11,297 --> 01:56:13,299
I had done makeup effects for

1882
01:56:13,366 --> 01:56:16,006
"Prison" and so I got a call

1883
01:56:16,069 --> 01:56:20,540
from Renny saying, "Would you like to do this film?"
Yeah, okay, sure, absolutely.

1884
01:56:20,606 --> 01:56:23,883
I liked working with Ren ny. He was very creative

1885
01:56:23,943 --> 01:56:27,186
and really began to push what we could do

1886
01:56:27,246 --> 01:56:28,816
live, in camera.

1887
01:56:28,881 --> 01:56:31,088
I ended up passing the makeup off to

1888
01:56:31,150 --> 01:56:32,254
Howard Berger.

1889
01:56:32,318 --> 01:56:34,855
"Here, go make Robert up for the next six weeks.
And you can hear all his stories."

1890
01:56:35,021 --> 01:56:39,436
I was very polite and so I was waiting for Robert to finish talking
before I would do stuff.

1891
01:56:39,492 --> 01:56:41,597
But Robert talks and talks and talks and talks.

1892
01:56:41,661 --> 01:56:44,904
"I saw Barbra Streisand in New York,
my first time she was singing,

1893
01:56:44,964 --> 01:56:46,739
she was still singing like small clubs."

1894
01:56:46,799 --> 01:56:50,611
I've heard every Robert Englund story ever.
I mean, by year three or four I would sit there,

1895
01:56:50,670 --> 01:56:52,013
I could finish them for him.

1896
01:56:52,071 --> 01:56:57,544
"I ï¬‚ew, no one grabbed me, and 37 stitches.
I thought my careerwas over."

1897
01:56:57,610 --> 01:57:00,682
I could just say, "No, no, rest your voice."
"So, this is uvhat happen ed to Robert when he did this movie."

1898
01:57:00,813 --> 01:57:04,693
There would be times where I, literally, wouldjust
put my arm on Robert's head and hold him,

1899
01:57:04,751 --> 01:57:07,755
you know, like put him in a headlock almost,
and do his makeup, you know.

1900
01:57:07,820 --> 01:57:10,357
'Cause Kevin said, "Just get in there.
Just disregard what he has to say.

1901
01:57:10,423 --> 01:57:11,458
Justjump in and start doing the makeup."

1902
01:57:11,657 --> 01:57:14,501
It was a completely collaborative unit

1903
01:57:14,560 --> 01:57:17,632
that created those effects

1904
01:57:17,697 --> 01:57:19,233
and anybody could come in with

1905
01:57:19,298 --> 01:57:20,276
their ideas.

1906
01:57:20,333 --> 01:57:25,715
But they had no idea what the hell we were gonna
be doing, so we would brainstorm and figure,

1907
01:57:25,772 --> 01:57:27,718
"Well, what if we did this and what if this happened."

1908
01:57:27,774 --> 01:57:33,383
They would have a release date before they even had a script,
so we were just always up against the gun.

1909
01:57:33,446 --> 01:57:36,893
I think on "Nightmare 4" we, literally, were shooting something, I
want to say, like, two weeks before the movie came out.

1910
01:57:36,949 --> 01:57:38,622
Kevin called and was like,
"Oh, we've got a pickup to do." And I'm like,

1911
01:57:38,684 --> 01:57:42,689
"The movie comes out next week," or whatever.
But it didn't matter, it's just the way those movies work.

1912
01:57:42,789 --> 01:57:47,204
I think I remember seeing the poster for "Nightmare 4"
before we ever started shooting.

1913
01:57:47,260 --> 01:57:49,262
I was like, "This is just insanity."

1914
01:57:49,328 --> 01:57:52,673
I was pretty beat up from other work

1915
01:57:52,732 --> 01:57:55,906
wnen I began "Part 4". I was committed, I just wasn't

1916
01:57:55,968 --> 01:57:59,506
completely behind the project, I think, with enthusiasm.

1917
01:57:59,639 --> 01:58:06,215
Atter the first week of shooting, When I cut some footage together
and showed it to everybody, I think everybody sort of woke up.

1918
01:58:06,279 --> 01:58:09,783
I went, "Aha! this is the 'MTV' Nightmare."

1919
01:58:09,849 --> 01:58:12,295
It's energetic, it's kinetic.

1920
01:58:12,351 --> 01:58:14,991
They were using tricks and techniques, both in camera

1921
01:58:15,054 --> 01:58:16,590
and for post,

1922
01:58:16,656 --> 01:58:18,693
that I couldn't imagine.

1923
01:58:18,758 --> 01:58:25,471
I was so excited about seeing that, that I mean, I, literally,
got my second wind that night and for the rest of that shoot.

1924
01:58:25,531 --> 01:58:30,378
With Robert Englund back in the saddle again,
Freddy set his sights on fresh meat.

1925
01:58:30,436 --> 01:58:35,283
Once again, taking each of his victim's fears
to a mmole new level.

1926
01:58:35,341 --> 01:58:42,259
"The Black Girl looks a bit nerdy, with thick glasses short hair,
but makes up for it with a hip sense of style."

1927
01:58:42,315 --> 01:58:48,755
I loved my death scene.
(laughing) It was actually my first on-camera kiss.

1928
01:58:48,821 --> 01:58:50,425
The idea of the

1929
01:58:50,490 --> 01:58:53,096
hand coming through the desk,

1930
01:58:53,159 --> 01:58:54,570
I thought that uvas kind of

1931
01:58:54,627 --> 01:58:55,605
900W and

1932
01:58:55,661 --> 01:58:55,729
stupid.

1933
01:58:55,795 --> 01:58:56,239
Stupid.

1934
01:58:56,295 --> 01:58:59,003
It was like from another movie,
I don't know what I was thinking.

1935
01:58:59,065 --> 01:59:00,601
I was thinking "Terminator" or something.

1936
01:59:00,666 --> 01:59:04,944
And I just remember When he was coming towards me,
they said they had to use the real claws

1937
01:59:05,004 --> 01:59:07,484
because it was such an extreme close-up.

1938
01:59:07,540 --> 01:59:09,247
So they were really sharp.

1939
01:59:09,308 --> 01:59:13,051
And I just remember he pulled my skin with

1940
01:59:13,112 --> 01:59:14,250
the real claw

1941
01:59:14,313 --> 01:59:18,989
so when I was done with the day I had
these pin pricks all underneath my chin.

1942
01:59:19,051 --> 01:59:22,089
"Want to suck face?" "No."

1943
01:59:22,155 --> 01:59:23,327
When I said, "No,"

1944
01:59:23,389 --> 01:59:29,101
he came dovm and his dentures ï¬‚ew out of his mouth,
he was like this close, straight into my mouth.

1945
01:59:29,162 --> 01:59:34,009
And it was like saliva and probably what
he ate that day andjust crud.

1946
01:59:34,066 --> 01:59:38,276
I heard that Toy said something about us doing ADR,
looping her lines

1947
01:59:38,337 --> 01:59:40,214
because she didn't sound "black" enough.

1948
01:59:40,273 --> 01:59:43,584
Renny came up to me and he's like,
"You're going to redo all your lines."

1949
01:59:43,643 --> 01:59:48,149
And I was like, "Excuse me?"
And he's like, "Yeah, because you don't sound

1950
01:59:48,214 --> 01:59:51,093
like a black girl and this is not how a black gin is."

1951
01:59:51,150 --> 01:59:54,654
And it kind of pissed me off, to be quite frank.
And so I confronted him on it.

1952
01:59:54,720 --> 01:59:56,893
And, it didn't go so well.

1953
01:59:56,956 --> 02:00:00,335
I don't remember this. I'm from Finland.
What do I know?

1954
02:00:00,393 --> 02:00:03,272
I would deny it, too. Hell. (laughing)

1955
02:00:03,329 --> 02:00:08,642
if that's true, that must have come from somebody else.
it sounds like Bob Sh aye.

1956
02:00:08,701 --> 02:00:12,649
When it finally came out, Rennywalked up to me
and he put his arm around me and

1957
02:00:12,705 --> 02:00:18,587
he's like, "I didn't know any better. I'm really sorry," you know.
"You're getting some really good reviews

1958
02:00:18,644 --> 02:00:20,282
and thank you for challenging me on that."

1959
02:00:20,513 --> 02:00:27,260
"Rick, Alice's brother, is shimmying out of an
upper ï¬‚oor window and with surprising grace,

1960
02:00:27,320 --> 02:00:30,927
he maneuvers to the ground and lands
smiling in front of the girls."

1961
02:00:30,990 --> 02:00:34,437
First, Lisa and I were twins and then <i>I was,</i> I think,
I was supposed to live.

1962
02:00:34,493 --> 02:00:36,632
And then there was this very elaborate, cool death scene.

1963
02:00:36,796 --> 02:00:40,107
Originally what happened is he went into the elevator

1964
02:00:40,166 --> 02:00:41,804
and it was a nightmare elevator

1965
02:00:41,867 --> 02:00:45,940
and the elevator started falling apart and the walls came off

1966
02:00:46,005 --> 02:00:49,043
and he's like falling through space, darkness.

1967
02:00:49,108 --> 02:00:51,247
That <i>was,</i> literally, a scene mmere we ran out

1968
02:00:51,310 --> 02:00:56,623
of money. And nobody knewmmat to do,
how was he going to be killed and what's going to happen.

1969
02:00:56,682 --> 02:01:00,755
We were working with an unfinished script
that we were finishing while we were doing it.

1970
02:01:00,820 --> 02:01:06,361
Somebody said, "Look, why does he have to die at all?
Let's just not even have the scene."

1971
02:01:06,425 --> 02:01:09,634
And then, well, we already shot the funeral scene,

1972
02:01:09,695 --> 02:01:11,299
he is dead, he's in the coffin.

1973
02:01:11,364 --> 02:01:13,742
And I said, "Well, he should die in some kind of

1974
02:01:13,799 --> 02:01:16,109
martial ans scene, because we've already set that up."

1975
02:01:16,168 --> 02:01:20,446
We have no money to build any kind of a set,
so all we could do was hang these fabrics

1976
02:01:20,506 --> 02:01:23,680
and make it look like it's like Japanese or something.

1977
02:01:23,743 --> 02:01:30,183
One of the epic fails, I think, of the sequences in
"Nightmare 4" is when Rick fights invisible Freddy.

1978
02:01:30,249 --> 02:01:35,961
The only death scene probably in any "Nightmare on Elm
Street" where Freddy is not actually there.

1979
02:01:36,022 --> 02:01:39,094
And I worked really hard for about two and a half, three weeks

1980
02:01:39,158 --> 02:01:42,071
just to get some basic skills dovm.

1981
02:01:42,128 --> 02:01:45,439
And then I got on the set and they pretty much said,

1982
02:01:45,498 --> 02:01:47,375
"No, no, no, we don't want that," you know.

1983
02:01:47,433 --> 02:01:50,004
It was just, they wanted all big roundhouse punches.

1984
02:01:50,069 --> 02:01:53,710
That's not karate at all, it's full-on John Wayne bullshit.

1985
02:01:53,773 --> 02:01:56,652
So cheaply done, and so kind of cheesy.

1986
02:01:56,709 --> 02:01:58,689
I mean, massively lame.

1987
02:01:58,744 --> 02:02:00,246
I'd had an appendix operation.

1988
02:02:00,313 --> 02:02:01,189
I ended up like

1989
02:02:01,247 --> 02:02:04,091
tearing my scars doing that scene and
had to go to the hospital for that.

1990
02:02:04,550 --> 02:02:08,657
I love the cockroach scene. That's great.

1991
02:02:08,721 --> 02:02:14,034
Youve got "Raiders of the Lost Ark" where you go,
"lndy's frightened of snakes," right.

1992
02:02:14,093 --> 02:02:17,267
Okay, so what happens later on in the film?
He gets thrown in the snake pit.

1993
02:02:17,330 --> 02:02:20,277
So we have this character who's frightened of bu gs, right,

1994
02:02:20,333 --> 02:02:26,181
<i>so</i> what do you expect? You expect the same thing, you know, <i>she's
</i> gonna be taken over by tons of cockroaches. And, you know,

1995
02:02:26,238 --> 02:02:30,380
what we did was we completely turned it around and
we had her tum into a cockroach.

1996
02:02:30,443 --> 02:02:36,416
"Debbie Stevens, is one well put together item.
A tough but smart gin from the wrong side of the tracks."

1997
02:02:36,482 --> 02:02:39,395
I was working with Screaming Mad George,
who was the makeup artist

1998
02:02:39,452 --> 02:02:42,023
who did all of my cockroach stuff, and he

1999
02:02:42,088 --> 02:02:43,829
was just fabulous.

2000
02:02:43,889 --> 02:02:45,698
I don't even know why he's called
Screaming Mad George.

2001
02:02:45,758 --> 02:02:47,203
I think hejust came up with that,

2002
02:02:47,259 --> 02:02:48,397
you know, it's kind of crazy.

2003
02:02:48,461 --> 02:02:49,531
<i>(giggling)</i>

2004
02:02:49,795 --> 02:02:56,405
The makeup was in credibly challenging.
Sitting in the seat for probably about

2005
02:02:56,469 --> 02:02:59,575
three and a half hours getting all of the

2006
02:02:59,638 --> 02:03:02,812
prosthetics put on and all of the makeup and

2007
02:03:02,875 --> 02:03:03,615
all of the blood

2008
02:03:03,676 --> 02:03:06,657
and all the guts that they had to attach.
And then I had these huge arms.

2009
02:03:06,812 --> 02:03:11,192
It was all very visceral, you know,
you had like tons of stretchy chunks of ï¬‚esh stuff

2010
02:03:11,250 --> 02:03:12,490
covered in slime

2011
02:03:12,551 --> 02:03:13,291
and covered in blood.

2012
02:03:13,352 --> 02:03:16,993
I remember doing it and feeling like,
"Oh my God, this is going to look so goofy,"

2013
02:03:17,056 --> 02:03:18,433
'cause the arms

2014
02:03:18,491 --> 02:03:20,334
were ï¬‚oppy and ï¬‚ipping and ï¬‚opping

2015
02:03:20,393 --> 02:03:22,805
this and that way and nothing seemed to quite work.

2016
02:03:23,028 --> 02:03:25,702
When my arms break and fall off

2017
02:03:25,765 --> 02:03:27,574
it's only my head.

2018
02:03:27,633 --> 02:03:32,981
So I'm in a box, I'm like low in a box like that,
and on top is this big fake body that

2019
02:03:33,038 --> 02:03:34,016
I had to do a bodycast for.

2020
02:03:34,140 --> 02:03:39,590
So theyve got me all glued in, I'm all in this thing.
I sat in that box for

2021
02:03:39,645 --> 02:03:42,387
five hours and I finally was like,

2022
02:03:42,448 --> 02:03:46,021
"I have to pee." (giggling)
And they're like handing me a styrofoam cup.

2023
02:03:46,085 --> 02:03:51,558
I don't have a penis! I can't pee in the cup!
Can't do it, won't do it! Gotta get me out.

2024
02:03:51,724 --> 02:03:54,637
By building the set in a very specific way, making

2025
02:03:54,693 --> 02:03:56,570
it sort of a forced perspective set

2026
02:03:56,629 --> 02:03:57,699
and all that,

2027
02:03:57,763 --> 02:04:02,872
it actually sort of ended up being
kind of scary and surreal and weird.

2028
02:04:02,935 --> 02:04:04,642
I'm in goo in a cockroach

2029
02:04:04,703 --> 02:04:06,876
cast and they're paying me to do this.

2030
02:04:07,072 --> 02:04:09,746
I love, my favorite shot is Freddy looks

2031
02:04:09,809 --> 02:04:12,688
into the roach motel and it's his eye looking into it.

2032
02:04:12,745 --> 02:04:15,021
Ohhhhh, you know, in the roach motel

2033
02:04:15,080 --> 02:04:15,285
and, "Splat!"

2034
02:04:15,448 --> 02:04:24,596
Working on the "Nightmare on Elm Street" movies are a
complete hoot because you don't just get to rip people apart,

2035
02:04:24,657 --> 02:04:25,795
you get to do things that are

2036
02:04:25,858 --> 02:04:29,738
imaginative and fun and surrealistic and it is an artist's dream.

2037
02:04:29,895 --> 02:04:34,173
The Rialto Cinema sequence is my

2038
02:04:34,233 --> 02:04:37,339
favorite scene in the movie. It was very hard to

2039
02:04:37,403 --> 02:04:38,780
accomplish the mmole sequence.

2040
02:04:38,838 --> 02:04:40,784
We built pan of the balcony

2041
02:04:40,840 --> 02:04:42,251
seaï¬‚ng

2042
02:04:42,308 --> 02:04:45,255
sideways, so that she was actually hanging from the chair.

2043
02:04:45,311 --> 02:04:50,351
They mounted the camera on that balcony
and that mmole balcony turned

2044
02:04:50,416 --> 02:04:52,657
so it became vertical.

2045
02:04:52,718 --> 02:04:57,724
And I wanted it to sort of build slowiy with, you know,
things starting to ï¬‚y toward the screen

2046
02:04:57,790 --> 02:04:59,064
and the popcorn starts ï¬‚ying

2047
02:04:59,124 --> 02:05:00,569
and the drink goes.

2048
02:05:00,626 --> 02:05:02,867
<i>'And, of course, the hardest part was were'</i>

2049
02:05:02,928 --> 02:05:05,670
she actually hits the screen and kind of blends

2050
02:05:05,731 --> 02:05:07,210
and becomes pan of the movie.

2051
02:05:07,266 --> 02:05:11,408
You actually see her hit the screen and
go from a 3-dimensional person to a

2052
02:05:11,470 --> 02:05:13,143
Z-dimen sional movie and

2053
02:05:13,205 --> 02:05:14,650
that had never been done.

2054
02:05:14,707 --> 02:05:18,678
To me, it was like a movie lover's sequence and kind of

2055
02:05:18,744 --> 02:05:19,620
a homage to

2056
02:05:19,678 --> 02:05:21,316
cinema in general.

2057
02:05:21,380 --> 02:05:23,656
PlayingAlice - the one who never got married

2058
02:05:23,716 --> 02:05:25,855
(laughing) and never left the restaurant, old Alice -

2059
02:05:25,918 --> 02:05:27,625
we tried old-age makeup

2060
02:05:27,686 --> 02:05:29,666
and Renny didn't like it. So then, I think

2061
02:05:29,722 --> 02:05:31,759
we finally ended up using a prosthetic.

2062
02:05:31,824 --> 02:05:34,168
Thick, rubbery stuff glued on

2063
02:05:34,226 --> 02:05:35,204
to really get me looking old.

2064
02:05:36,762 --> 02:05:38,036
I came up with the idea of

2065
02:05:38,097 --> 02:05:39,940
the faces in the pizza.

2066
02:05:39,999 --> 02:05:41,603
We did the horror pizza,

2067
02:05:41,667 --> 02:05:42,975
the soul food.

2068
02:05:43,035 --> 02:05:44,241
"Rick, you little meatball."

2069
02:05:44,303 --> 02:05:45,748
We ordered from Domino's,

2070
02:05:45,804 --> 02:05:46,748
we took pictures of him

2071
02:05:46,805 --> 02:05:50,844
and did a clay press out of it. Sculpted all these

2072
02:05:50,910 --> 02:05:52,184
individual little meatball

2073
02:05:52,244 --> 02:05:53,222
heads.

2074
02:05:53,279 --> 02:05:55,953
And then we did a full-scale pizza with

2075
02:05:56,015 --> 02:05:58,586
the real actors' faces in it.

2076
02:05:58,651 --> 02:06:02,929
And we made them all move around, "Aaahhhh."
You know, doing weird things.

2077
02:06:02,988 --> 02:06:05,559
(laughing) I remember when

2078
02:06:05,624 --> 02:06:07,467
he puts the fork into his

2079
02:06:07,526 --> 02:06:11,269
face and it just kind of goes like that,
it just worked so well.

2080
02:06:11,330 --> 02:06:14,038
My favorite sequence of all the
"Nightmare on Elm Street" films

2081
02:06:14,099 --> 02:06:15,373
is in "Part 4" when

2082
02:06:15,434 --> 02:06:20,008
Lisa Wilcox leaves The Crave Inn. Get it, The Crave Inn?

2083
02:06:20,072 --> 02:06:22,143
"Come on, we have to hurry!" "What's going on?"

2084
02:06:22,207 --> 02:06:24,915
I remember coming up with this idea of a loop in the scene

2085
02:06:24,977 --> 02:06:28,982
where it keeps repeating itself and
that's how they figured out they were in a dream.

2086
02:06:29,048 --> 02:06:29,992
By the second time I'm in

2087
02:06:30,049 --> 02:06:31,653
the loop, I have an upset stomach

2088
02:06:31,717 --> 02:06:33,697
because I kn ow something bad's gonna happen.

2089
02:06:33,752 --> 02:06:35,129
"Come on, we have to hurry!" "What's going on?"

2090
02:06:35,187 --> 02:06:41,263
And that's just such a brilliant realization of a dream, to me.

2091
02:06:41,327 --> 02:06:47,209
When we sat down to think about the ending
and how to kill Freddy,

2092
02:06:47,266 --> 02:06:50,145
we, literally, said, "Okay, well, how do monsters

2093
02:06:50,202 --> 02:06:52,808
get killed in movies?" You can

2094
02:06:52,871 --> 02:06:53,645
chop them up,

2095
02:06:53,706 --> 02:06:54,844
you can shoot them,

2096
02:06:54,907 --> 02:06:56,443
you can bum them,

2097
02:06:56,508 --> 02:06:58,078
you can blow them up.

2098
02:06:58,143 --> 02:07:04,025
But what all those ways have in common is that
it's always a force coming ï¬‚'om outside

2099
02:07:04,083 --> 02:07:06,029
that destroys the evil.

2100
02:07:06,085 --> 02:07:07,291
I brought in a picture of

2101
02:07:07,353 --> 02:07:11,130
"The Ecstasy of St. Theresa,"
which is this Bernini sculpture.

2102
02:07:11,190 --> 02:07:14,967
The expression on her face is of divine ecstasy,

2103
02:07:15,027 --> 02:07:17,633
of having seen God. And so there's a scene

2104
02:07:17,696 --> 02:07:19,175
she's supposedly defeated

2105
02:07:19,231 --> 02:07:20,608
and she looks up at these

2106
02:07:20,666 --> 02:07:26,344
little children who are like angels. And what we wanted
was the idea that in that moment,

2107
02:07:26,405 --> 02:07:28,908
God is filling her with ecstatic grace.

2108
02:07:28,974 --> 02:07:32,478
Then she could see him for what he <i>was,</i>
mmich was just evil and,

2109
02:07:32,544 --> 02:07:34,820
"just look at yourself, look how low you are."

2110
02:07:34,880 --> 02:07:40,159
That's howwe created the mmole idea of
these souls trapped inside Freddy and that

2111
02:07:40,219 --> 02:07:43,200
they're gonna be set free and they are from inside out.

2112
02:07:43,255 --> 02:07:45,599
They're gonna rip him apart and destroy him.

2113
02:07:45,658 --> 02:07:48,332
"1, 2, S!"

2114
02:07:48,394 --> 02:07:51,102
We actually did all these little radio-controlled faces that

2115
02:07:51,163 --> 02:07:53,234
kind of (shrieking) and moved around

2116
02:07:53,298 --> 02:07:55,039
and screamed and stuff.

2117
02:07:55,100 --> 02:07:57,410
(laughing) I remember the little stubby hands coming in

2118
02:07:57,469 --> 02:08:03,681
and grabbing stuff and grabbing his head and
it was so goofy and looked so silly when we were doing it.

2119
02:08:03,742 --> 02:08:05,722
Steve Johnson built this enormous,

2120
02:08:05,778 --> 02:08:08,452
gigantic Freddy Krueger chest and all these

2121
02:08:08,514 --> 02:08:11,927
nude people were all painted up and pressing through
this dental dam chest, and I just thought

2122
02:08:11,984 --> 02:08:12,962
thatwas so cool.

2123
02:08:13,018 --> 02:08:15,464
You go on the set one day and there's, like,

2124
02:08:15,521 --> 02:08:17,501
a bunch of girls walking around topless.

2125
02:08:17,556 --> 02:08:21,094
It's very important, symbolically, for this thing
and you're bare, you're naked.

2126
02:08:21,160 --> 02:08:22,366
So I got them to take their clothes off

2127
02:08:22,428 --> 02:08:24,931
and then I had these girls pressing
themselves against the chest.

2128
02:08:24,997 --> 02:08:28,240
And I was like, "This is genius. Every teenage boy
is going to love this."

2129
02:08:28,300 --> 02:08:32,009
"Linnea, push out! Push your chest out, Linnea!"

2130
02:08:32,071 --> 02:08:34,051
They were shooting this piece

2131
02:08:34,106 --> 02:08:35,847
and people are pressing on it, you know,

2132
02:08:35,908 --> 02:08:36,978
and pushing through it

2133
02:08:37,042 --> 02:08:40,216
and I don't think it was mounted as
stable as they had requested and

2134
02:08:40,279 --> 02:08:42,657
up on top was this little Japanese woman, Michiko.

2135
02:08:42,715 --> 02:08:44,991
You know something went a little bit wrong and

2136
02:08:45,050 --> 02:08:46,654
the whole thing came tumbling dovm.

2137
02:08:46,719 --> 02:08:48,824
"Oh no!"

2138
02:08:48,987 --> 02:08:52,434
You know, crew members are falling from the rafters.

2139
02:08:52,491 --> 02:08:55,028
Here's poor little Michiko crushed by a
giant Freddy Krueger chest.

2140
02:08:55,194 --> 02:09:01,440
There <i>was,</i> in general, on the set an aura of panic.

2141
02:09:01,500 --> 02:09:07,075
Bob Shaye was sure that he had made the wrong choice,
all through the production, so he would come to the set

2142
02:09:07,139 --> 02:09:09,210
and look around and had this really grumpy expression

2143
02:09:09,274 --> 02:09:15,816
on his face and this really sort of suspicious look, like,
"This Finnish guy has no idea what he is doing."

2144
02:09:15,881 --> 02:09:17,656
No one wants Bob on set.

2145
02:09:17,716 --> 02:09:23,189
Renny being the worst. Renny being,
"You take care of it, Rachel! You take care ofhim!" (laughing)

2146
02:09:23,255 --> 02:09:26,702
And I would try to work hard and come up with great ideas and

2147
02:09:26,759 --> 02:09:32,471
win him over, but I couldn't. He pretty much never
spoke to me during the WhOIE production, except, like,

2148
02:09:32,531 --> 02:09:34,875
grunting and looking really unhappy.

2149
02:09:34,933 --> 02:09:39,780
Nightmare 4's success would ultimately
be left up to audiences and the response

2150
02:09:39,838 --> 02:09:45,754
to the film's release on August 19, 1988
was a surprise to everyone.

2151
02:09:45,811 --> 02:09:49,384
Pretty much all I could read <i>was,</i> like,

2152
02:09:49,448 --> 02:09:50,483
great reviews.

2153
02:09:50,549 --> 02:09:53,155
They found all kinds of hidden meanings in the movie that

2154
02:09:53,218 --> 02:09:55,129
I didn't even know the movie had and

2155
02:09:55,187 --> 02:09:58,168
I was completely blovm away.
That was the last thing I expected.

2156
02:09:58,223 --> 02:09:59,133
It was the biggest

2157
02:09:59,191 --> 02:10:01,762
of all of them. It far out-grossed anything.

2158
02:10:01,827 --> 02:10:04,171
And then, eventually, the movie made about $50 million

2159
02:10:04,229 --> 02:10:06,505
dollars in domestic box office,

2160
02:10:06,565 --> 02:10:10,877
which was at the time, the most successful
independent movie ever made.

2161
02:10:10,936 --> 02:10:13,712
He delivered a great film, in my opinion,
he did a really good job.

2162
02:10:13,772 --> 02:10:16,582
Ren ny Harlin I thought was a very talented director.

2163
02:10:16,642 --> 02:10:18,553
It's a tough thing to make fresh and he did.

2164
02:10:18,610 --> 02:10:19,918
Bob Sh aye called me

2165
02:10:19,978 --> 02:10:25,985
opening day and called me and said,
"You know, I have a habit of taking a limo

2166
02:10:26,051 --> 02:10:31,330
and driving around, going to different theaters
and looking at the reactions of the audience.

2167
02:10:31,390 --> 02:10:32,562
Would you like to join me?"

2168
02:10:32,624 --> 02:10:35,070
And we start driving around going to these theaters

2169
02:10:35,127 --> 02:10:36,800
and there's lines around the block.

2170
02:10:36,862 --> 02:10:42,813
I said to Bob, I said, "I gotta call my mom."
Because my mom in Finland had been worried

2171
02:10:42,868 --> 02:10:47,112
to death now for three years. Most months I didn't
even have money to call my mom and

2172
02:10:47,172 --> 02:10:48,913
she didn't knowmmat was going on with me.

2173
02:10:48,974 --> 02:10:53,320
And I called his mother and told her in Swedish
what a great guy her son was.

2174
02:10:53,378 --> 02:10:58,657
And my mother is like, "I'm talking to the head of
the studio and he's telling that my son is a genius

2175
02:10:58,717 --> 02:11:01,220
and he's made the biggest hit of the company."

2176
02:11:01,286 --> 02:11:05,792
At the time that "Nightmare 4" came out,
I think it was probably, in a strange way, the hippest,

2177
02:11:05,858 --> 02:11:06,996
deconstructed,

2178
02:11:07,059 --> 02:11:09,767
kind of MTV film made.

2179
02:11:09,828 --> 02:11:16,006
Over that weekend my life changed completely.
And the first phone call I got on Monday in my ï¬‚eabag hotel,

2180
02:11:16,068 --> 02:11:20,608
I thought somebody was pulling a prank on me when
the manager called my room and said,

2181
02:11:20,672 --> 02:11:23,915
"I have Mr. Spielberg on the line."
And that was the first call on Monday.

2182
02:11:23,976 --> 02:11:28,789
Just a struggling loser like the rest ofus
in Hollywood and within a year he was directing

2183
02:11:28,847 --> 02:11:31,851
"Die Hard 2" and hanging out with Sylvester Stallone.

2184
02:11:31,917 --> 02:11:36,491
It's one of those crazy things in Hollywood.
You just never know who's gonna become huge.

2185
02:11:36,555 --> 02:11:41,368
It wasn't long before other studios tried
to cash in on the Freddy phenomenon.

2186
02:11:41,426 --> 02:11:47,377
Even Bollywood got into the act.

2187
02:11:47,566 --> 02:11:50,638
By now, there's Johnny Carson jokes,

2188
02:11:50,702 --> 02:11:52,010
there's political cartoons of Freddy,

2189
02:11:52,070 --> 02:11:53,208
Freddy's in the funny papers,

2190
02:11:53,272 --> 02:11:56,151
Tom Hanks is making Freddy jokes in movies.

2191
02:11:56,208 --> 02:11:59,246
"It's 'Nightmare on Elm Street,' and that
would make him Freddy Krueger."

2192
02:11:59,378 --> 02:12:01,380
Anything that's bad is

2193
02:12:01,446 --> 02:12:02,789
"A Nightmare in the National League,"

2194
02:12:02,848 --> 02:12:03,883
"ANightmare in the NFL,"

2195
02:12:03,949 --> 02:12:05,223
"A Nightmare in the N BA,"

2196
02:12:05,284 --> 02:12:06,524
it's "A Nightmare in Iraq."

2197
02:12:06,585 --> 02:12:13,059
"When you take a walk down our opposition's memory lane, it starts
to look like "Nightmare on Elm Street." (laughing audience)

2198
02:12:13,258 --> 02:12:14,498
We were so pan of the vernacular.

2199
02:12:14,660 --> 02:12:18,802
Everything - from the beginning of the fact that it could be
made into a sequel to the merchandising -

2200
02:12:18,864 --> 02:12:20,969
were things that never, ever occurred to me.

2201
02:12:21,033 --> 02:12:23,070
It was interesting to see all the Freddy stuff,

2202
02:12:23,135 --> 02:12:24,546
all the merchandise, you know, 'cause

2203
02:12:24,603 --> 02:12:25,604
it was a million toys.

2204
02:12:25,671 --> 02:12:26,877
The Freddy gloves, the hat.

2205
02:12:26,939 --> 02:12:27,849
The early merchandising

2206
02:12:27,906 --> 02:12:29,214
they just thought toys

2207
02:12:29,274 --> 02:12:30,514
they just went for kids.

2208
02:12:30,575 --> 02:12:33,317
A misconceived idea, incidentally, a Freddy doll.

2209
02:12:33,378 --> 02:12:35,255
<i>'(cackling Freddy doll)'</i>

2210
02:12:35,314 --> 02:12:36,258
<i>(laughing)</i>

2211
02:12:36,315 --> 02:12:37,851
He became kind of

2212
02:12:37,916 --> 02:12:39,657
the ultimate cuddly toy to have next to you.

2213
02:12:39,718 --> 02:12:40,958
He became cool.

2214
02:12:41,019 --> 02:12:42,896
I'm like, "Okay, I made it!"

2215
02:12:42,955 --> 02:12:44,366
"I'm an action figure!"

2216
02:12:44,423 --> 02:12:45,333
Nobody ever takes them out of

2217
02:12:45,390 --> 02:12:47,700
their packages anyway,
so they're all hanging up on people's walls.

2218
02:12:47,759 --> 02:12:50,330
"We've got 12 of these Wall O'ffect Freddy Faces,

2219
02:12:50,395 --> 02:12:52,341
12 Deluxe Freddy Masks and

2220
02:12:52,397 --> 02:12:55,207
12 Screaming Freddy Chests of Souls."

2221
02:12:55,267 --> 02:12:57,543
There were watches, jewelry.

2222
02:12:57,602 --> 02:12:59,047
Freddy Krueger pillowcases.

2223
02:12:59,104 --> 02:13:00,105
At one point,

2224
02:13:00,172 --> 02:13:03,517
some company even made Freddy pajamas for little kids,

2225
02:13:03,575 --> 02:13:05,782
which, considering Freddy started out as a child molester...

2226
02:13:05,911 --> 02:13:10,758
"Kids, go put on your Charles Manson pajamas on
before you go to bed." Kind of the same thing, you know.

2227
02:13:10,816 --> 02:13:13,126
The strangest piece of Freddy merchandise was

2228
02:13:13,185 --> 02:13:15,290
Valium in St. Petersburg.

2229
02:13:15,354 --> 02:13:18,426
It said in Cyrillic, "Take one and he will come for you."

2230
02:13:18,490 --> 02:13:21,403
Unlicensed, I'm sure. Tough luck, New Line.

2231
02:13:21,460 --> 02:13:23,633
I think there was a point mmere

2232
02:13:23,695 --> 02:13:25,231
I thought there was a little bit

2233
02:13:25,297 --> 02:13:27,299
too much Freddy out there in pop culture.

2234
02:13:27,366 --> 02:13:31,576
It seemed like, for a certain amount of time,
people just couldn't get enough of the character.

2235
02:13:31,770 --> 02:13:35,650
One of the nice things is Robert is
a loveable ham and

2236
02:13:35,707 --> 02:13:37,550
he was just into all of it.

2237
02:13:37,609 --> 02:13:40,317
"I'm Freddy, and this is for you."

2238
02:13:40,379 --> 02:13:42,655
<i>(laughing maniacally)</i>

2239
02:13:42,714 --> 02:13:43,692
You could see the twinkle

2240
02:13:43,749 --> 02:13:46,855
in his eye when he gets underneath
all that makeup and -- be it

2241
02:13:46,918 --> 02:13:48,420
rapping with the Fat Boys,

2242
02:13:48,487 --> 02:13:51,195
"It's time for Freddy."

2243
02:13:51,256 --> 02:13:53,429
or selling his own 900 number,

2244
02:13:53,492 --> 02:13:57,531
"Freddy Krueger is just a phone call away."

2245
02:13:57,696 --> 02:13:59,334
-- he's having the time of his life.

2246
02:13:59,498 --> 02:14:04,004
You suddenly become woven into Americana
then and you become legendary.

2247
02:14:04,069 --> 02:14:05,605
When you travel the globe

2248
02:14:05,670 --> 02:14:06,580
and you say "Freddy Krueger"

2249
02:14:06,638 --> 02:14:07,378
people know who you are talking about.

2250
02:14:19,284 --> 02:14:22,595
By the time it got to television, (laughing)
it was so much like, "Ah, they're going to drag this

2251
02:14:22,654 --> 02:14:24,429
for every possible venue they can."

2252
02:14:24,489 --> 02:14:25,593
We said, "You know,

2253
02:14:25,657 --> 02:14:28,331
maybe we can turn this into
a syndicated television show."

2254
02:14:28,393 --> 02:14:29,633
The show that wound up being

2255
02:14:29,694 --> 02:14:32,140
"Nightmare on Elm Street: Freddy's Nightmares."

2256
02:14:32,197 --> 02:14:35,735
It was going to really be this novel approach to television.

2257
02:14:35,801 --> 02:14:39,146
This was the promise I was told.
That we were gonna be on late at night and

2258
02:14:39,204 --> 02:14:42,515
we could be dark and we could really push the envelope.

2259
02:14:42,574 --> 02:14:45,384
This show gave a lot of sort of up-and-comers a chance

2260
02:14:45,444 --> 02:14:47,685
to, you know, to get a start.

2261
02:14:47,746 --> 02:14:52,991
Anybody who wanted to direct one, could direct one, anybody who wanted to be in
one, could be in one, (laughing) anyone who wanted to write one, could write one.

2262
02:14:53,151 --> 02:14:55,825
They had a guest star every single week.

2263
02:14:55,987 --> 02:14:57,933
Brad Pitt's in there,

2264
02:14:58,523 --> 02:14:59,695
Mariska Hargitay.

2265
02:15:00,292 --> 02:15:03,171
I got to decapitate Lori Petty.

2266
02:15:03,395 --> 02:15:06,808
Not many people have that on their resume
and I'm proud of it.

2267
02:15:06,865 --> 02:15:10,745
It was interesting having done a "Friday the 13th"
TV series and then

2268
02:15:10,802 --> 02:15:15,478
a "Nightmare on Elm Street" TV series.
Both things really didn't represent

2269
02:15:15,540 --> 02:15:17,850
what the movie franchises were.

2270
02:15:17,909 --> 02:15:20,788
"Freddy's Nightmares" as a concept
was always anthological

2271
02:15:20,846 --> 02:15:23,759
and to have him introduced,
he was the Cryptkeeper,

2272
02:15:23,815 --> 02:15:24,953
he was Alfred Hitchcock,

2273
02:15:25,016 --> 02:15:26,120
he was Rod Sening.

2274
02:15:26,184 --> 02:15:27,822
We were going to call ourselves, like,

2275
02:15:27,886 --> 02:15:32,631
a dark, violent "Twilight Zone" with Freddy as a sort of

2276
02:15:32,691 --> 02:15:33,795
host and

2277
02:15:33,859 --> 02:15:35,566
participant.

2278
02:15:35,627 --> 02:15:39,803
I thinkthey basically had him in for, you know,
one day, two days orvmatever,

2279
02:15:39,865 --> 02:15:42,903
and did all those things
so he didn't have to go in and out of the makeup.

2280
02:15:42,968 --> 02:15:48,646
He was only in the wrap-arounds really to my episode,
but they also asked me to do two of the other wrap-arounds

2281
02:15:48,707 --> 02:15:49,708
aside from my show.

2282
02:15:49,774 --> 02:15:54,621
And those were getting shot at the same time
you were doing your episodes, so you would, literally,

2283
02:15:54,679 --> 02:15:58,217
run to another set, which was not in the same building,

2284
02:15:58,283 --> 02:15:59,387
do the stuff with Robert Englund,

2285
02:15:59,551 --> 02:16:04,523
and as soon as you yell "Cut!" you ran back and
did your other shot on the other stage.

2286
02:16:04,589 --> 02:16:04,896
So, it was crazy. (laughing)

2287
02:16:05,056 --> 02:16:08,094
"Freddy's Nightmares" -- certainly a nightmare
in many respects.

2288
02:16:08,160 --> 02:16:10,766
In a way it was like film school because I learned

2289
02:16:10,829 --> 02:16:14,834
how to really be well prepared when you came on to the set
because you were doomed otherwise. (laughing)

2290
02:16:14,900 --> 02:16:16,379
The only thing I could remember about the series

2291
02:16:16,434 --> 02:16:19,540
was it was so cheap.
Cheap, cheap, cheap. (laughing)

2292
02:16:19,604 --> 02:16:20,776
"No one's perfect, bubble head."

2293
02:16:20,839 --> 02:16:24,719
The budgets were quite low and
they went lower as time went on.

2294
02:16:24,776 --> 02:16:28,986
I would say by the tenth one they were
pretty miserable and I stopped paying attention.

2295
02:16:29,047 --> 02:16:34,224
They really didn't care about the <i>show,</i>
it was just a cash cow, and so we just ran amok.

2296
02:16:34,286 --> 02:16:35,060
I mean, we'd do

2297
02:16:35,120 --> 02:16:37,031
whatever it was we wanted to do.

2298
02:16:37,189 --> 02:16:42,298
"Action! <i>"</i> " B len d-o-m ati c ! ! " (laughing maniacaffy)

2299
02:16:42,360 --> 02:16:43,668
All of the early episodes

2300
02:16:43,728 --> 02:16:48,108
were originally intended to be
two half hours that were vaguely linked.

2301
02:16:48,400 --> 02:16:51,244
And I would say the first five or six episodes
are pretty good.

2302
02:16:51,603 --> 02:16:53,776
In fact, I play significantly in one of them.

2303
02:16:54,005 --> 02:16:59,250
If you ever see the Pilot for "Freddy's Nightmares"
you'll knowmmat the show is supposed to be.

2304
02:16:59,311 --> 02:17:03,020
The "No More Mr. Nice Guy" episode of
"Freddy's Nightmares" was great because

2305
02:17:03,081 --> 02:17:04,355
it was the backstory

2306
02:17:04,416 --> 02:17:06,896
of Freddy Kru eger. It's the history of how

2307
02:17:06,952 --> 02:17:08,363
Freddy became Freddy.

2308
02:17:08,420 --> 02:17:10,661
Tobe Hooper did the Pilot.

2309
02:17:10,722 --> 02:17:12,759
He's one of my favorite directors, and people,
in Hollywood.

2310
02:17:12,857 --> 02:17:15,838
And Tobe did this dark, wonderful Pilot.

2311
02:17:15,927 --> 02:17:20,273
"Springwoorfs nightmares are just beginning."

2312
02:17:20,498 --> 02:17:27,245
My daughter at that time was 15 years old, or something like
that, and she had just had a birthday and I got

2313
02:17:27,305 --> 02:17:29,573
Robert to wish her "Happy Birthday" on camera.

2314
02:17:29,574 --> 02:17:35,456
"Happy Birthday, Robin. What are you, 15?"

2315
02:17:35,513 --> 02:17:38,926
She was like the star of her school, you know.

2316
02:17:38,984 --> 02:17:42,932
"Bet you wish you had a leamefs permit, or better yet,
a drivers license.

2317
02:17:42,988 --> 02:17:49,428
Too bad you're not going to see Sweet 16, bitch!" (evil laugh)

2318
02:17:49,494 --> 02:17:55,342
We really crossed the boundaries quite often in terms of
what was acceptable on commercial television.

2319
02:17:55,400 --> 02:17:58,847
"Freddy's Nightmares" was very politically incorrect.

2320
02:17:58,903 --> 02:17:59,938
That was pan of the fun of it.

2321
02:18:00,005 --> 02:18:03,976
"Yes-haw! Ride 'em, cowboy!'

2322
02:18:04,042 --> 02:18:06,113
"You got any saddle sores yet?"

2323
02:18:06,344 --> 02:18:09,416
You could go places that no other show

2324
02:18:09,481 --> 02:18:10,619
would let you go.

2325
02:18:10,682 --> 02:18:12,855
There are scenes of relatively

2326
02:18:12,917 --> 02:18:14,396
graphic sex and violence.

2327
02:18:14,452 --> 02:18:17,695
We did shoot a lot of extra footage,
so to speak, (laughing)

2328
02:18:17,756 --> 02:18:21,135
and we'd just go, "Yeah, let's have her naked in this shot,"
or something like that. (laughing)

2329
02:18:21,192 --> 02:18:27,165
Knowing full well none of this would wind up in the show.
(laughing) Or we'd have some bloodbath knowing it

2330
02:18:27,232 --> 02:18:29,439
was gonna get cut anyway, so we'djust do it.

2331
02:18:29,501 --> 02:18:32,914
There was lots of that stuff, I mean,
one of the ones I directed

2332
02:18:32,971 --> 02:18:35,042
had like a full Peckinpah

2333
02:18:35,106 --> 02:18:36,016
male-on-female

2334
02:18:36,074 --> 02:18:37,382
violent sequence.

2335
02:18:37,442 --> 02:18:43,290
Because it was syndicated it played at different times
in different markets and each of the stations could

2336
02:18:43,348 --> 02:18:45,021
put it on whenever they unwanted to.

2337
02:18:45,083 --> 02:18:47,427
But what happened was they put us on at

2338
02:18:47,485 --> 02:18:49,829
4 and 5, 6 o'clock in the afternoon in the Bible Belt

2339
02:18:49,888 --> 02:18:52,732
and there was all this reaction and complaining.

2340
02:18:52,791 --> 02:18:57,069
The network clamps down heavily on censorship issues.

2341
02:18:57,128 --> 02:19:00,234
The "Safe Sex" episode, which was the last episode
they bought for the first season,

2342
02:19:00,298 --> 02:19:01,971
they said, "Cut out eight minutes."

2343
02:19:05,070 --> 02:19:08,108
"'l'lme for the Big Bang, Cherry Bomb!" (kissing)

2344
02:19:08,406 --> 02:19:11,944
It really was not great television.

2345
02:19:12,010 --> 02:19:17,050
I can't bear to watch them now because
they're just so wracked.

2346
02:19:17,115 --> 02:19:21,962
"How 'bout I make you a Bloody Harry?"

2347
02:19:22,020 --> 02:19:23,795
<i>(screaming)</i>

2348
02:19:23,855 --> 02:19:28,167
It was fun. It was fun to do. (laughing)
It has not stood the test of time.

2349
02:19:28,226 --> 02:19:35,144
I blame, to some extent, the quality of the
production that really hastened its demise.

2350
02:19:35,200 --> 02:19:38,340
Our crew from "Freddy's Nightmares,"
when we were canceled,

2351
02:19:38,403 --> 02:19:40,212
went over and took over "Tales from the Crypt"

2352
02:19:40,271 --> 02:19:42,615
and single-handedly brought dovm
the budget of that show

2353
02:19:42,674 --> 02:19:45,484
so that it was manageable, or that show
would have been long gone, too.

2354
02:19:45,543 --> 02:19:49,150
<i>(laughing)</i>

2355
02:19:49,214 --> 02:19:51,785
<i>(laughing)</i>

2356
02:20:04,729 --> 02:20:11,203
After the stellar box office success of "Dream Masterâ€œ
and with the series at the height of its popularity,

2357
02:20:11,269 --> 02:20:16,218
New Line Cinema decided the time had come to tackle
deeper, more mature themes.

2358
02:20:16,274 --> 02:20:18,777
Freddy would become a father.

2359
02:20:18,843 --> 02:20:22,290
The story for "Nightmare 5" was
controversial with some people.

2360
02:20:22,347 --> 02:20:24,725
I really think that I came up with the story. (laughing)

2361
02:20:24,783 --> 02:20:32,395
Because I was a new mother and I was consumed
by my child who could very possibly have been the devil,

2362
02:20:32,457 --> 02:20:33,936
he had "Omen" type qualities. (laughing)

2363
02:20:34,225 --> 02:20:39,732
I mean, the target audience was originally teenagers
and to scare the holy bejesus out of them and

2364
02:20:39,798 --> 02:20:42,335
that teenage audience was now growing up.

2365
02:20:42,400 --> 02:20:47,509
And I remember stressing that during
the whole creation of the script.

2366
02:20:47,572 --> 02:20:51,577
In the late '80s, early '90s there was
a minor movement in horror.

2367
02:20:51,810 --> 02:20:55,952
This kind of hardcore, unbridled,
rock 'n' roll horror fiction.

2368
02:20:56,414 --> 02:21:01,227
We were radical, troublemaking horror writers
who all emerged at right about the same time.

2369
02:21:01,286 --> 02:21:06,463
Splatterpunk writing had a direct influence on
how the movie fianchises were going.

2370
02:21:06,524 --> 02:21:09,937
Basically, as I understand it with "Nightmare 5,"
there was a

2371
02:21:09,994 --> 02:21:15,603
Splatterpunk cattle call, vi/nere every horror writer
who was working in that milieu got contacted

2372
02:21:15,667 --> 02:21:17,772
by New Line going, "Pitch us."

2373
02:21:17,836 --> 02:21:20,077
Mike DeLuca, then a

2374
02:21:20,138 --> 02:21:24,348
development guy at New Line,
called me in to ask me if I'd be interested in writing

2375
02:21:24,409 --> 02:21:27,481
and I went in and wrote, gave them a treatment called

2376
02:21:27,545 --> 02:21:32,927
"Freddy Rules." It posited the existence of a dream reality
location

2377
02:21:32,984 --> 02:21:37,057
called "The Coma Pit." It's the one place Freddy's afraid of.

2378
02:21:37,121 --> 02:21:42,230
And I was the only person in Hollywood without
a script in their back pocket, so I did not get the job.

2379
02:21:42,760 --> 02:21:46,333
DeLuca was a huge fan of "The Light at the End."
That was the first novel that Craig and I wrote,

2380
02:21:46,397 --> 02:21:50,709
which was this punk vampire in the subways
of New York, and he was always a fan of this thing.

2381
02:21:50,768 --> 02:21:54,341
And out of all the guys that pitched,
Craig and I were the ones that won.

2382
02:21:54,405 --> 02:22:00,754
I thought it needed to have those themes
of abortion and birth and motherhood.

2383
02:22:00,945 --> 02:22:04,358
These were the elements all coming together

2384
02:22:04,415 --> 02:22:07,487
with Alice dreaming her baby's dreams, seeing

2385
02:22:07,552 --> 02:22:11,193
Freddy leak into them and then going into Freddy's dreams,

2386
02:22:11,256 --> 02:22:14,396
in the unconscious, to find out what made him a monster.

2387
02:22:14,459 --> 02:22:17,702
We wrote what we thought was a pretty solid first drafi.
They said, "Well, you know,

2388
02:22:17,762 --> 02:22:24,976
you wrote a "Nightmare on Elm Street" movie like
a Stanley Kubrick would do it." And then we said,

2389
02:22:25,036 --> 02:22:26,538
"Yeah, cool, huh?" And they said, "No."

2390
02:22:26,604 --> 02:22:27,412
And our ass was out the door.

2391
02:22:27,739 --> 02:22:35,715
For "Nightmare 3" I had pitched them Freddy as a baby.
And I went in - one of the executives was pregnant at the time -

2392
02:22:35,780 --> 02:22:42,698
and I <i>was,</i> literally, picturing, "Picture the claws clawing their
way out." And, no one liked my idea. (laughing)

2393
02:22:42,887 --> 02:22:46,767
So then I got a call for "Nightmare 5" and

2394
02:22:46,824 --> 02:22:50,738
when they came to me they said,
"Remember wnen you wanted Freddy to have a baby?

2395
02:22:50,795 --> 02:22:52,775
Well, we like that idea now.

2396
02:22:52,830 --> 02:22:54,537
What if Alice was the mom?"

2397
02:22:54,599 --> 02:23:00,641
Without an approved, finished script in hand and with
a looming release date on the calendar, New Line sought out

2398
02:23:00,705 --> 02:23:07,213
the next hungry filmmaker who could deliver
a visually stunning "Nightmare" on budget and on schedule.

2399
02:23:07,278 --> 02:23:11,385
Stephen Hopkins, who was our director, was terrific.

2400
02:23:11,449 --> 02:23:13,156
He had really come from

2401
02:23:13,217 --> 02:23:14,560
the an direction world.

2402
02:23:14,619 --> 02:23:16,895
He was just so visual.

2403
02:23:16,955 --> 02:23:22,462
I guess they'd been seeing a bunch of different people,
but I did big storyboards, I had a lot of ideas about, you know,

2404
02:23:22,527 --> 02:23:24,131
the three different scripts they had sent to me.

2405
02:23:24,195 --> 02:23:27,233
And Stephen was telling me some ideas and
he started to doodle,

2406
02:23:27,298 --> 02:23:30,905
like a cartoon, like a graphic novel.
It was like, "Well, this guy's great."

2407
02:23:30,969 --> 02:23:33,779
Stephen was a big comic book buff.

2408
02:23:33,838 --> 02:23:35,613
He has tens of thousands of comic books.

2409
02:23:35,673 --> 02:23:38,244
Nice English guy, we got along very well,
we were good friends.

2410
02:23:38,309 --> 02:23:45,193
Bob was very determined to make this one,
back to being, you know, more serious and creepy, I think.

2411
02:23:45,249 --> 02:23:47,627
The idea was to make Freddy scary again because

2412
02:23:47,685 --> 02:23:53,931
at this particular point he was definitely in danger of
turning into like a game show host or a breakfast cereal mascot,

2413
02:23:53,992 --> 02:23:55,164
which is, of course, what happened.

2414
02:23:55,226 --> 02:23:58,400
I got the job on Valentine's Day

2415
02:23:58,463 --> 02:24:01,376
and it was out in 3000 cinemas in August.

2416
02:24:01,432 --> 02:24:04,276
I think we only had like 4 weeks prep for this film.

2417
02:24:04,335 --> 02:24:08,806
I remember, "Nightmare on Elm Street Part 5"
I can't believe they're gettin,' it's so quick.

2418
02:24:08,873 --> 02:24:10,580
I mean, they did rush it.

2419
02:24:10,642 --> 02:24:13,020
The script wasn't really a complete script

2420
02:24:13,177 --> 02:24:20,095
and in the end, I think, Mike DeLuca and I
sort of just got all the different pages and put them into shape.

2421
02:24:20,151 --> 02:24:21,459
Basically it came dovm to

2422
02:24:21,519 --> 02:24:23,362
Alice is pregnant and

2423
02:24:23,421 --> 02:24:24,661
she's gonna give birth to Freddy,

2424
02:24:24,722 --> 02:24:26,531
so how was this going to play.

2425
02:24:26,591 --> 02:24:31,404
We had to make up a set of rules
for what he was doing to get himself into the real wand,

2426
02:24:31,462 --> 02:24:34,068
which may be a little muddy in the movie,
but it was essentially,

2427
02:24:34,132 --> 02:24:36,738
get all four of her friends' souls and then get them

2428
02:24:36,801 --> 02:24:37,074
into the baby.

2429
02:24:37,301 --> 02:24:39,247
Alice,

2430
02:24:39,303 --> 02:24:40,407
well, she was an important figure.

2431
02:24:40,471 --> 02:24:43,077
The story certainly wasn't finished in the fourth one.

2432
02:24:43,141 --> 02:24:48,113
I felt a lot more confident just from my experience
from doing "4" and doing a feature film.

2433
02:24:48,346 --> 02:24:56,766
The fact that they even called me back, I was super happy.
I was like, "Yes! They called me back to do another one?"

2434
02:24:56,821 --> 02:24:58,300
And I was like, "Lucky. Phew!"

2435
02:24:58,356 --> 02:25:03,305
"Through the sm/ining crowd we see Alice
standing with Yvonne, a very grounded black girl."

2436
02:25:03,361 --> 02:25:08,037
I thought it was really interesting when I played this character
because you don't always agree with your friends.

2437
02:25:08,099 --> 02:25:09,772
"Why don't you take off?"

2438
02:25:09,834 --> 02:25:12,337
Hey, you know, sometimes you tell your friend,
"You're full of shit."

2439
02:25:12,403 --> 02:25:15,441
Kelly Jo, she rocked.
She was a real firebrand.

2440
02:25:15,506 --> 02:25:23,948
"Mark, good-looking, though considerably off-th e-wall, steps into
shot holding a small sketchpad and a large, excessive lollipop."

2441
02:25:24,015 --> 02:25:25,926
I actually would have made the character darker.

2442
02:25:25,983 --> 02:25:32,093
I wanted him to be a bit more goth,
I wantedjet black hair and like bone shins,

2443
02:25:32,390 --> 02:25:37,305
but I got blond hair instead and
shins that looked better on camera, I guess.

2444
02:25:37,361 --> 02:25:40,604
It was hard to find the right actor for Joe's part,

2445
02:25:40,665 --> 02:25:41,700
the comic book artist.

2446
02:25:41,766 --> 02:25:45,612
The Mark characterwas Stephen's idea,
and it was based on Stephen, I would say.

2447
02:25:45,670 --> 02:25:46,648
He's a comic book guy.

2448
02:25:46,704 --> 02:25:49,878
It was my job to fall in love with Erika
and that wasn't hard.

2449
02:25:49,941 --> 02:25:54,651
"Pan over to Greta and her mother standing
at the edge of the group. Greta is living proof of

2450
02:25:54,712 --> 02:25:57,591
what God can create when he's having a good day."

2451
02:25:57,648 --> 02:25:59,753
I remember that Stephen Hopkins told me that he

2452
02:25:59,817 --> 02:26:04,288
chose me because I wasn't afraid to get really ugly. (laughing)

2453
02:26:04,355 --> 02:26:08,064
And I guess a lot of girls were concerned with that
and they didn't really want to go that far,

2454
02:26:08,226 --> 02:26:09,364
but I did.

2455
02:26:09,594 --> 02:26:11,801
Erika was just gorgeous,

2456
02:26:11,863 --> 02:26:12,898
she was the funniest one, I think, of the lot.

2457
02:26:13,097 --> 02:26:15,737
We didn't really have a bad apple in the bunch.

2458
02:26:15,800 --> 02:26:19,338
I think everybody was pretty game for
whatever they could do.

2459
02:26:19,403 --> 02:26:24,580
Inspired by the traditions of gothic horror,
the cast and crew of "The Dream Child"

2460
02:26:24,642 --> 02:26:29,250
set out to delve even further into the origins of Freddy's evil.

2461
02:26:29,313 --> 02:26:35,923
I thinkthe dark, gothic thing was partly me because
I remember Bob Shaye kept on saying, you know,

2462
02:26:35,987 --> 02:26:37,398
"Every time he hires Europeans

2463
02:26:37,455 --> 02:26:39,196
gargoyles end up on top of buildings,"

2464
02:26:39,257 --> 02:26:40,292
and all that kind of stuff. (laughing)

2465
02:26:40,491 --> 02:26:44,530
I also had my most thrilling experience on

2466
02:26:44,595 --> 02:26:48,702
You were going to see who Freddy's father was
in the asylum and it was Robert Englund without makeup,

2467
02:26:48,766 --> 02:26:51,747
with my hair all greased back to show my bald spot.

2468
02:26:51,803 --> 02:26:53,783
I play Amanda Krueger,

2469
02:26:53,838 --> 02:26:57,547
the nurse who gets locked into the asylum.
It was a dream sequence.

2470
02:26:57,775 --> 02:27:00,415
<i>'Hove the sort of Roger German, you know,'</i>

2471
02:27:00,478 --> 02:27:01,889
huge,

2472
02:27:01,946 --> 02:27:03,448
just the way the asylum looks.

2473
02:27:03,514 --> 02:27:05,357
And I got locked in a room and they'd gotten

2474
02:27:05,416 --> 02:27:07,692
every performance art actor

2475
02:27:07,752 --> 02:27:09,857
where they all got to do their crazy,

2476
02:27:09,921 --> 02:27:12,458
psycho snake pit, "Cuckoo's Nest" thing.

2477
02:27:12,523 --> 02:27:15,367
What you see is what you get, I mean,
it was a big room.

2478
02:27:15,426 --> 02:27:18,737
Hundreds of men walking around, acting crazy.

2479
02:27:18,796 --> 02:27:20,400
It got a little hinky, 'cause those actors

2480
02:27:20,464 --> 02:27:23,274
they got a little, you know,
it was like a mob.

2481
02:27:23,334 --> 02:27:25,245
And when they said, "Roll," on that

2482
02:27:25,303 --> 02:27:28,079
I was like, "Oh my gosh."

2483
02:27:28,139 --> 02:27:33,316
Yeah, I was really fighting the ï¬‚ow for a while
with those guys, 'cause not all of them were film actors

2484
02:27:33,377 --> 02:27:34,515
and they wouldn't hold back.

2485
02:27:34,579 --> 02:27:37,287
Like, "This is scary, this is really scary."

2486
02:27:37,348 --> 02:27:39,555
But it's a very effective sequence

2487
02:27:39,617 --> 02:27:41,619
and it looks like a trillion bucks.

2488
02:27:41,686 --> 02:27:43,893
The idea of a thousand maniacs (laughing)

2489
02:27:43,955 --> 02:27:46,663
raping a nun, that's always good stuff.

2490
02:27:46,891 --> 02:27:49,303
On "Elm Street 5," the changes

2491
02:27:49,360 --> 02:27:52,034
on Freddy were to make him a little more

2492
02:27:52,096 --> 02:27:53,200
aged

2493
02:27:53,264 --> 02:27:54,607
and a little more weathered.

2494
02:27:54,665 --> 02:27:58,203
They brought David Miller back because
they wanted to refine the makeup,

2495
02:27:58,269 --> 02:28:00,442
make it easier, make it simpler.

2496
02:28:00,504 --> 02:28:04,509
I just felt - and I don't knowvimat the limitations were,
maybe it was time, maybe it was money --

2497
02:28:04,575 --> 02:28:07,317
that the makeup for "Pan 5" was nowhere as

2498
02:28:07,378 --> 02:28:10,222
refined as the one that Kevin Yagher did.

2499
02:28:13,351 --> 02:28:17,322
Freddy gets born in that crazy birth sequence, (laughing)

2500
02:28:17,388 --> 02:28:20,198
he comes shooting out like the "Alien" out of her vagina

2501
02:28:20,258 --> 02:28:22,602
and runs all over the place. (laughing)

2502
02:28:22,660 --> 02:28:24,105
But it was quite disgusting, too.

2503
02:28:24,161 --> 02:28:25,003
We made a little puppet,

2504
02:28:25,062 --> 02:28:26,302
it was a little foam rubber puppet

2505
02:28:26,364 --> 02:28:28,935
and it had mechanics in the eyes and mouth.

2506
02:28:29,000 --> 02:28:30,877
I got to play with him off set

2507
02:28:30,935 --> 02:28:33,415
and I was making him do this.

2508
02:28:33,471 --> 02:28:36,941
That was kind of when we were
at the height of the latex prosthetic

2509
02:28:37,008 --> 02:28:38,487
monster innovation

2510
02:28:38,542 --> 02:28:42,217
period, right in the heartbeat before CGI.

2511
02:28:42,280 --> 02:28:47,457
It was a little challenging because
he had to go from being newborn

2512
02:28:47,518 --> 02:28:49,691
little baby,

2513
02:28:49,754 --> 02:28:51,927
all the way up 'til the final Freddy look.

2514
02:28:51,989 --> 02:28:54,833
We actually had a small person

2515
02:28:54,892 --> 02:28:57,236
for Freddy to make the set look bigger as the altar

2516
02:28:57,295 --> 02:28:59,070
rose out of the thing.

2517
02:28:59,130 --> 02:29:00,473
In the church scene

2518
02:29:00,531 --> 02:29:02,238
where I encounter Freddy

2519
02:29:02,300 --> 02:29:05,713
and I tell him that his birth was the
curse on the mmole of humanity,

2520
02:29:05,770 --> 02:29:07,545
"I will not allow it to happen again."

2521
02:29:07,605 --> 02:29:11,951
It was also very upsetting as a mother, 'cause Freddy curses.

2522
02:29:12,009 --> 02:29:14,853
"We'll see, bitch."

2523
02:29:14,912 --> 02:29:17,153
I'm his mom and I just didn't think that was very nice.

2524
02:29:17,214 --> 02:29:20,388
There was exactly one line of our dialogue lefi in the film,

2525
02:29:20,451 --> 02:29:23,955
"W5 a boy!"

2526
02:29:24,155 --> 02:29:25,463
but it's also the one they used

2527
02:29:25,523 --> 02:29:27,298
for the poster, so that worked out okay.

2528
02:29:27,358 --> 02:29:34,469
"Jacob, a boy of about six or seven years
stands there, watching Alice. He's frail. Other worldly.

2529
02:29:34,532 --> 02:29:38,309
Not ghost-like, but possessing a strange, transcendent quality."

2530
02:29:38,369 --> 02:29:41,714
The first day, admittedly, I was scared because

2531
02:29:41,772 --> 02:29:45,652
Robert's there and he's on set,
automatically looks over

2532
02:29:45,710 --> 02:29:51,126
(laughing) and he points at me and he walks
towards me, and I almost took a dump at that point.

2533
02:29:51,182 --> 02:29:53,822
The kid is terrific, he'sjust wonderful.

2534
02:29:53,884 --> 02:29:57,161
He'd gone through quite a diff cult period
of his life during that film.

2535
02:29:57,221 --> 02:29:59,326
My dad passed away in real life.

2536
02:29:59,390 --> 02:30:07,810
He was my hero and I loved him and it was really great
to get to work, you know, and kind of forget about it

2537
02:30:07,865 --> 02:30:10,744
and be in a real state of imagination,

2538
02:30:10,801 --> 02:30:12,940
which is what that set was.

2539
02:30:13,004 --> 02:30:20,479
Amid constant script changes and a rushed production
schedule, the cast and crew of "Nightmare 5"

2540
02:30:20,544 --> 02:30:23,718
were left to wonder how, or even if, the finished film would play.

2541
02:30:23,781 --> 02:30:28,389
Now "Nightmare 5" is shooting,
having gone through all of these other writers,

2542
02:30:28,452 --> 02:30:30,227
they bring it back to me --

2543
02:30:30,287 --> 02:30:32,130
the movie that I couldn't get hired to write -

2544
02:30:32,189 --> 02:30:34,260
they brought it back to me for dialogue polish.

2545
02:30:34,325 --> 02:30:37,829
I remember the script was changing
as we were going through it.

2546
02:30:37,895 --> 02:30:43,368
We were just racing to do it, and I mean,
I didn't really have much time to miss things that weren't there.

2547
02:30:43,434 --> 02:30:47,610
L, eventually, just stopped trying to memorize scenes
because I knew they'd be different the next day.

2548
02:30:47,671 --> 02:30:50,151
We would just put together sequences and

2549
02:30:50,207 --> 02:30:53,984
solve problems with storyboard ideas
when we couldn't figure out what to do.

2550
02:30:54,045 --> 02:30:58,619
He would sit while were doing the scene, literally, and go,
"it'll look like this," you know, and draw the picture.

2551
02:30:58,682 --> 02:31:06,066
There wasn't always a lot of direction happening.
Stephen was spread really thin and, he said at one point,

2552
02:31:06,123 --> 02:31:08,034
"You're gonna pretty much have to
direct yourself in these scenes."

2553
02:31:08,092 --> 02:31:12,939
We were at an old, like I think it was a Spaghetti Factory
or something like that, where they made noodles.

2554
02:31:12,997 --> 02:31:14,135
And there were sets

2555
02:31:14,198 --> 02:31:15,336
<i>everywhere.</i>

2556
02:31:15,399 --> 02:31:19,438
We'd have to shush people because they were
trying to build while we were shooting.

2557
02:31:19,503 --> 02:31:22,541
There were all these different levels there
and he'd be running up and down stairs

2558
02:31:22,606 --> 02:31:24,916
to all the different locations.

2559
02:31:24,975 --> 02:31:29,321
As I'm talking about it, I can't believe we actually did
all this stuff. I mean, I wouldn't even attempt it now.

2560
02:31:29,380 --> 02:31:33,920
If someone showed you a schedule to try and attempt to do
all these physical effects or something, you'd just laugh.

2561
02:31:33,984 --> 02:31:36,965
"This boy feels the need for speed."

2562
02:31:37,021 --> 02:31:38,694
I was the first one to die in

2563
02:31:38,756 --> 02:31:39,131
but it was a cool death scene.

2564
02:31:39,390 --> 02:31:45,204
They were working with special effects to build
a running motorcycle that looked like it had been beat to hell.

2565
02:31:45,262 --> 02:31:48,402
Every time he was getting stabbed by
something from the motorcycle,

2566
02:31:48,466 --> 02:31:51,242
it was starting to convert him into the iron man.

2567
02:31:51,302 --> 02:31:52,212
And, you know, I took a lot of inï¬‚uence from

2568
02:31:52,269 --> 02:31:54,249
Giger, I think, at the time, you know,

2569
02:31:54,305 --> 02:31:55,682
and a couple other great artists.

2570
02:31:55,940 --> 02:32:00,389
It was pretty fun to work with all that stuff and
make it look the way it did, because even today

2571
02:32:00,444 --> 02:32:01,479
people are like, "Wow."

2572
02:32:01,545 --> 02:32:03,684
Right on camera it was really good because
you could see the stuff

2573
02:32:03,747 --> 02:32:05,249
moving under the skin.

2574
02:32:05,316 --> 02:32:06,761
A lot of it was done in reverse,

2575
02:32:06,817 --> 02:32:09,957
you know, he had prosthetics put underneath the skin,
which would pull out.

2576
02:32:10,020 --> 02:32:12,057
<i>We did tests and tests and tests.</i>

2577
02:32:12,123 --> 02:32:13,761
We started with the hypodermics

2578
02:32:13,824 --> 02:32:15,167
then we injected this chemical into it.

2579
02:32:15,226 --> 02:32:19,106
<i>â€œOh, nice.â€œ "Bkchin." â€œCool?</i>

2580
02:32:19,263 --> 02:32:21,675
The biggest thing, though,
was of course the suit. We had to

2581
02:32:21,732 --> 02:32:23,803
build the suit -- boom -- ground up.

2582
02:32:23,868 --> 02:32:28,078
We didn't have time to do castings, molds.

2583
02:32:28,139 --> 02:32:29,482
The stunt driver was going to be wearing it.

2584
02:32:29,540 --> 02:32:31,918
He came over at least ten times to do fittings

2585
02:32:31,976 --> 02:32:34,752
and we actually had Dan wear the head one time for

2586
02:32:34,812 --> 02:32:36,655
a close-up of just his eyes.

2587
02:32:36,714 --> 02:32:37,988
The end of the scene, they put me inside

2588
02:32:38,048 --> 02:32:40,654
a cab of a truck with all this makeup, a thing on my eye

2589
02:32:40,718 --> 02:32:43,221
and this whole neck piece and I look just wrecked.

2590
02:32:43,287 --> 02:32:44,857
And I have a line where I'm like, "Hey, Alice."

2591
02:32:44,922 --> 02:32:46,162
"Want to make babies?"

2592
02:32:46,223 --> 02:32:50,797
People were pulling over and then I stepped out
and they're like, "Oh my God." (laughing)

2593
02:32:50,861 --> 02:32:54,468
And we're like, "No, it's a movie, it's a movie."
But it looked so real and it was pretty fun.

2594
02:32:54,532 --> 02:32:55,306
It was like the best

2595
02:32:55,366 --> 02:32:57,209
Halloween costume I've ever had.

2596
02:32:57,268 --> 02:32:58,042
I was devastated

2597
02:32:58,102 --> 02:32:59,547
when I found out they were cutting it dovm.

2598
02:32:59,603 --> 02:33:03,915
I've seen the uncut version and the cut version,
and the cut version is just so truncated.

2599
02:33:03,974 --> 02:33:06,113
There's a snake hose thing that comes out
of the exhaust pipe

2600
02:33:06,177 --> 02:33:08,179
and it stabs the back of his calf. It's like,

2601
02:33:08,245 --> 02:33:10,782
everything is just about to happen
and they cut.

2602
02:33:12,383 --> 02:33:15,262
<i>(screaming)</i>

2603
02:33:15,452 --> 02:33:20,401
We just had to keep on cutting and cutting and cutting.
We were sending it back and forward to the MPAA,

2604
02:33:20,457 --> 02:33:21,993
I don't know, twenty times or so.

2605
02:33:22,059 --> 02:33:25,233
They cut out half of everything we did.

2606
02:33:25,296 --> 02:33:28,277
<i>(screaming)</i>

2607
02:33:28,465 --> 02:33:33,881
Well, every sequence in that went a lot further.
That's about the best way to describe it.

2608
02:33:33,938 --> 02:33:35,918
"Open wide!"

2609
02:33:35,973 --> 02:33:37,646
My favorite kill would be Greta.

2610
02:33:37,708 --> 02:33:40,484
I think Greta's is really cool.
I really do like that one a lot.

2611
02:33:40,544 --> 02:33:45,892
Iwent to high school with a girl named Greta
who became a model and was as anorexic as possible.

2612
02:33:46,016 --> 02:33:49,486
Then there was the Monty Python
"Meaning of Life" eating scene.

2613
02:33:49,687 --> 02:33:55,000
It just became almost like a vomiting food fight,
I mean, it really was gross.

2614
02:33:55,059 --> 02:33:56,561
All the people at the dinner party were

2615
02:33:56,627 --> 02:33:57,935
all laughing and there was something

2616
02:33:57,995 --> 02:33:59,269
clownish and weird about it.

2617
02:33:59,396 --> 02:34:00,773
I like Greta's mom.

2618
02:34:00,998 --> 02:34:02,875
"Don't talk with your mouth full, dear."

2619
02:34:03,167 --> 02:34:07,980
Todd Masters did my makeup and
he was fantastic and the first day that

2620
02:34:08,038 --> 02:34:11,747
I went in for a makeup test,
we did everything in three stages.

2621
02:34:11,809 --> 02:34:12,981
Spent a lot of time with Todd

2622
02:34:13,043 --> 02:34:18,994
just moving my mouth around and my jaw to see
what was the most horrifying way to sell it. (laughing)

2623
02:34:19,049 --> 02:34:20,027
And they wouldn't let me eat.

2624
02:34:20,084 --> 02:34:21,757
They told me that I had to have everything
through a straw and we had

2625
02:34:21,819 --> 02:34:24,891
long days and I got hungry.

2626
02:34:24,955 --> 02:34:29,370
And on, like, the third day or something I just said,
"You know, forget it. I'm gonna eat, I don't care."

2627
02:34:29,426 --> 02:34:35,604
They served spaghetti with tomato sauce and
all that tomato sauce was living in the pocket of

2628
02:34:35,666 --> 02:34:39,512
my chin and I could smell it all day, it was gross.

2629
02:34:39,570 --> 02:34:41,743
And I haven't done heavy prosthetics ever since. (laughing)

2630
02:34:41,805 --> 02:34:47,585
They actually gave me a copy of Erika's head
that didn't work for them,

2631
02:34:47,645 --> 02:34:51,991
and I teased her one time that it was my bath toy
and she kind of freaked out. (laughing)

2632
02:34:52,049 --> 02:34:55,462
Greta's death was deemed to be
much too foul.

2633
02:34:55,519 --> 02:34:56,862
I just know that the scene

2634
02:34:56,920 --> 02:34:58,365
was much longer.

2635
02:34:58,422 --> 02:35:00,129
Much longer and gorier.

2636
02:35:00,190 --> 02:35:02,534
I think Freddy fed herself to herself in the end.

2637
02:35:02,626 --> 02:35:06,836
But it just kind of just happened super fast,
the way that it ended up.

2638
02:35:06,897 --> 02:35:09,776
I don't think it uvas as good,
it didn't have as much impact.

2639
02:35:09,833 --> 02:35:14,805
It's so silly in nature to take it seriously.

2640
02:35:14,872 --> 02:35:17,216
I think if we had longer post
we could've fought more about it.

2641
02:35:19,943 --> 02:35:21,388
Well, the diving board

2642
02:35:21,445 --> 02:35:25,552
scene was complicated because
I had food poisoning.

2643
02:35:25,616 --> 02:35:27,596
I was so sick.

2644
02:35:27,651 --> 02:35:28,721
I thought I was going to die.

2645
02:35:28,786 --> 02:35:29,696
But, you know, the show must go on.

2646
02:35:29,887 --> 02:35:35,394
That <i>was,</i> maybe, one of the more complicated ones
because everything about it was stop-motion animation.

2647
02:35:35,459 --> 02:35:37,336
We did lots of stop-motion animation in the film.

2648
02:35:37,394 --> 02:35:42,070
We had made foam claws, you know,
at the end of the diving board,

2649
02:35:42,132 --> 02:35:44,112
that we animated frame by ï¬‚ame.

2650
02:35:44,168 --> 02:35:46,808
And then the background was projected.

2651
02:35:46,870 --> 02:35:48,543
It was a rear-screen projection.

2652
02:35:48,605 --> 02:35:49,982
And that board had to tum into a claw.

2653
02:35:50,040 --> 02:35:51,815
And that was a difficult one for Kelly to act

2654
02:35:51,875 --> 02:35:53,548
because she had nothing to work with.

2655
02:35:53,610 --> 02:35:54,680
I had never done anything with

2656
02:35:54,745 --> 02:35:56,452
special effects before.

2657
02:35:56,513 --> 02:36:01,019
'Cause it's one thing to see it and you're on the set
and then really come to life and you're seeing it on the film.

2658
02:36:01,285 --> 02:36:05,062
There's something, to this day I think,
stop-motion gets that nothing else does.

2659
02:36:05,122 --> 02:36:06,624
Digital doesn't really do it

2660
02:36:06,690 --> 02:36:09,102
because, in the end, stop-motion just charms you, I think.

2661
02:36:09,159 --> 02:36:10,638
I think I was surprised

2662
02:36:10,694 --> 02:36:12,002
that that character lived.

2663
02:36:12,062 --> 02:36:14,303
(laughing) Freddy did not kill the black girl!

2664
02:36:14,365 --> 02:36:18,040
I know that he did in another series,
but he didn't get me.

2665
02:36:18,102 --> 02:36:21,083
The ultimate thing that I learned from
this uvhole experience was that

2666
02:36:21,205 --> 02:36:23,685
hell is writing for other people.

2667
02:36:23,741 --> 02:36:26,153
We had this elaborate sequence

2668
02:36:26,210 --> 02:36:33,287
in this artist's loft where all of her artworks came to life
and it uvas really cool. And, eventually, it got turned,

2669
02:36:33,350 --> 02:36:34,488
in the subsequent 13 drafts,

2670
02:36:34,551 --> 02:36:36,394
into a comic book scene where Freddy's on a skateboard.

2671
02:36:36,453 --> 02:36:37,363
'

2672
02:36:37,421 --> 02:36:39,059
Obviously, the comic book sequence itself

2673
02:36:39,189 --> 02:36:39,963
is preposterous.

2674
02:36:40,023 --> 02:36:43,971
I think I put the superhero sequences in
'cause I'm a comic book freak.

2675
02:36:44,027 --> 02:36:44,971
'

2676
02:36:45,028 --> 02:36:46,939
I love the reinforcement of the nightmare of the boy

2677
02:36:46,997 --> 02:36:48,874
falling into his own cartoons.

2678
02:36:48,932 --> 02:36:52,106
Mark being sucked into the comic book
was pretty straighfom/ard and

2679
02:36:52,169 --> 02:36:54,615
easy, I think. That was pure animation.

2680
02:36:54,705 --> 02:36:56,048
The whole set

2681
02:36:56,106 --> 02:36:57,710
<i>km my death scene was painted mack and mite..</i>

2682
02:36:57,775 --> 02:36:58,480
You would think it uvas

2683
02:36:58,575 --> 02:37:00,680
just color taken out of the film, but no.

2684
02:37:00,778 --> 02:37:06,057
When they shot those, they made my face really red,
they got really bright

2685
02:37:06,116 --> 02:37:07,754
clothes that I was supposed to be in,

2686
02:37:07,818 --> 02:37:09,297
then they keyed everything back.

2687
02:37:09,420 --> 02:37:15,564
That was an interesting day. That <i>was,</i> you know,
another actor doing the kind of cartoon Freddy in that.

2688
02:37:15,626 --> 02:37:20,234
"Black and White Freddy leaps to his feet!
He is now transformed into Super Freddy."

2689
02:37:20,297 --> 02:37:22,675
They took Robert Englund's prosthetics

2690
02:37:22,733 --> 02:37:23,803
and fit them on my face

2691
02:37:23,901 --> 02:37:27,644
and then put other bits and pieces in there,
'cause I have a bigger head than he has.

2692
02:37:27,738 --> 02:37:30,878
The design for the Phantom Prowler had the 9 mm.

2693
02:37:30,941 --> 02:37:32,318
Th at was the first time I ever shot

2694
02:37:32,376 --> 02:37:33,411
a9mm.

2695
02:37:33,477 --> 02:37:36,890
Just having it "chbk-click" like that, (gunshot)
that was really fun.

2696
02:37:36,980 --> 02:37:40,189
That lightning bolt on my shin wasn't
supposed to be there, but

2697
02:37:40,250 --> 02:37:44,460
one of the squibs went off and my shirt caught on fire.
For me, I thought that uvas normal.

2698
02:37:44,521 --> 02:37:49,061
It's kind of crazy to think of what
I had to do just for those couple lines.

2699
02:37:49,126 --> 02:37:52,596
The interesting thing is my death scene,
I had almost nothing to do with it.

2700
02:37:52,663 --> 02:37:56,543
We used a replacement animation series

2701
02:37:56,600 --> 02:37:58,341
of cut-outs and I animated it

2702
02:37:58,402 --> 02:37:59,745
frame by ï¬‚ame

2703
02:37:59,803 --> 02:38:02,943
to finish the action.
That's the one that took the slash.

2704
02:38:03,006 --> 02:38:06,010
So, it was all done in the camera, basically,
there was no

2705
02:38:06,076 --> 02:38:07,384
opticals involved.

2706
02:38:07,444 --> 02:38:11,324
<i>I was,</i> I found out aï¬‚er it happened,
and I saw

2707
02:38:11,381 --> 02:38:13,452
Kelly Jo and Lisa crying and

2708
02:38:13,517 --> 02:38:16,396
they were shooting the scene after
I'd died and they said,

2709
02:38:16,453 --> 02:38:18,797
"You died last night."
And I went, "Huh? What?"

2710
02:38:18,856 --> 02:38:23,100
After we finished, I finish ed the Freddy Krueger stuff,
the next thing you know I was laying in bed with this hot chick.

2711
02:38:23,160 --> 02:38:26,539
You see those two bodies at the beginning
when the credits are rolling and they're making love.

2712
02:38:26,597 --> 02:38:27,871
That's me.

2713
02:38:27,931 --> 02:38:32,607
It was just sort of a supposed, you know,
stylized love sequence we were shooting.

2714
02:38:32,669 --> 02:38:37,550
And they said, "So Michael,
what would you think about doing a love scene?"

2715
02:38:37,608 --> 02:38:39,554
I said, "As Super Freddy?"

2716
02:38:39,610 --> 02:38:44,992
And he's buff, (laughing) he's like Lou Ferrigno buff.
So, it's like, however they made it look,

2717
02:38:45,048 --> 02:38:46,186
it made me look good.

2718
02:38:46,250 --> 02:38:46,557
Thanks, Michael.

2719
02:38:46,683 --> 02:38:51,189
Definitely an experience. I'm like, "Damn, this is Hollywood.
I love it. I want to do this more ofien."

2720
02:38:51,255 --> 02:38:58,104
After the loss of Dan and her friends, the stage was now set
for Alice's final showdown with Freddy.

2721
02:38:58,161 --> 02:39:01,631
But with the fate of Alice's unbom dream child
hanging in the balance,

2722
02:39:01,698 --> 02:39:06,204
the filmmakers were desperate to find
yet another fitting end for Freddy Krueger.

2723
02:39:06,970 --> 02:39:08,950
We had no ending to this movie, so

2724
02:39:09,006 --> 02:39:12,249
Stephen did some wonderful sketches.

2725
02:39:12,309 --> 02:39:16,257
The exorcism sequence is something I wanted to do
'cause I'm a big "Exorcist" fan and I stuck it in.

2726
02:39:16,313 --> 02:39:17,815
Stephen had such a vision

2727
02:39:17,881 --> 02:39:20,293
for that set. it was just in credible.

2728
02:39:20,350 --> 02:39:24,389
There was a certain quiet eeriness about it.

2729
02:39:24,454 --> 02:39:27,663
It was mind-bending to work out
because you had to really,

2730
02:39:27,724 --> 02:39:29,670
really work out in your head not

2731
02:39:29,726 --> 02:39:31,433
the reality of what was going on, but

2732
02:39:31,495 --> 02:39:34,101
the unreality. So getting all the angles right and stuff.

2733
02:39:34,164 --> 02:39:35,336
I had to hang upside down.

2734
02:39:35,432 --> 02:39:38,709
It was the single-most diff cult thing
I had to do, though, in any of the movies.

2735
02:39:38,769 --> 02:39:40,749
I mean, the moment they said "Cut" it was
"Guys, come and lift me up."

2736
02:39:40,804 --> 02:39:42,545
But, you know, the blood rushes to your head.

2737
02:39:42,606 --> 02:39:46,076
There were so many high points in visual effects
and fantasy in the film, trying to beat them all

2738
02:39:46,143 --> 02:39:47,315
at the end was pretty tough.

2739
02:39:47,411 --> 02:39:52,986
Mostly, what I remember about "Nightmare 5"
was that it gave K.N.B. the opportunity to really go nuts.

2740
02:39:53,050 --> 02:39:58,864
We basically handled this transformation sequence
where Lisa turns into Freddy and then splits.

2741
02:39:58,956 --> 02:40:02,335
I had to wear the Freddy makeup for a mmole day,

2742
02:40:02,392 --> 02:40:03,268
about twelve hours.

2743
02:40:03,327 --> 02:40:05,170
It was not comfortable. (laughing)

2744
02:40:05,228 --> 02:40:06,263
And in the final stage

2745
02:40:06,330 --> 02:40:07,604
it was Lisa's head and Robert's head, you know,

2746
02:40:07,664 --> 02:40:09,337
it's a puppet head in like this

2747
02:40:09,399 --> 02:40:11,072
and then pulled apart like this.

2748
02:40:11,134 --> 02:40:13,910
It was a challenge wnen Freddy's
coming out of me.

2749
02:40:13,971 --> 02:40:18,078
There's a paraplegic gentleman there
and she was having to hang onto him.

2750
02:40:18,141 --> 02:40:25,320
They took his, you know, legless torso
and kind of harnessed it to Lisa Wilcox's body.

2751
02:40:25,382 --> 02:40:28,295
He was on wires, I mean,
it was just endless.

2752
02:40:28,352 --> 02:40:32,562
I don't know, in a million years I wouldnt have thought
they would find a legless actor to do that.

2753
02:40:32,623 --> 02:40:38,938
Probably no one's seen anything quite like the final battle of
"Nightmare on Elm Street." It came out of desperate

2754
02:40:38,996 --> 02:40:41,806
script writing at the end, trying to work out
really how to end it and

2755
02:40:41,865 --> 02:40:46,541
how to show this kid's anger with Freddy.

2756
02:40:46,603 --> 02:40:48,844
I'd say, "I kill Freddy."
And they'd say, "How?" and I'd go,

2757
02:40:48,905 --> 02:40:55,754
"How do I describe that?" I, and literally this is the only way
that a 10- or 11-year-old can describe it,

2758
02:40:55,812 --> 02:40:58,019
"I barf on him."

2759
02:40:58,615 --> 02:40:59,753
That's what I would say.

2760
02:40:59,883 --> 02:41:01,021
I'd say I barf on him and it
goes through him and there's

2761
02:41:01,084 --> 02:41:02,222
heads on it.

2762
02:41:02,285 --> 02:41:03,355
Having all these creatures

2763
02:41:03,420 --> 02:41:08,130
that Freddy had eaten
coming out of his chest on long tendrils

2764
02:41:08,191 --> 02:41:10,262
like umbilical chords, which were all

2765
02:41:10,327 --> 02:41:12,568
on wires and puppets.

2766
02:41:12,629 --> 02:41:13,937
Visually very interesting,

2767
02:41:13,997 --> 02:41:20,380
but I think that a lot of those things were
attempts to cover the fact that they had

2768
02:41:20,437 --> 02:41:23,975
liposuctioned all the soul and intelligence out of the story.

2769
02:41:24,041 --> 02:41:26,954
I don't think you can ever kill Freddy, right?
I mean, you can do what you like,

2770
02:41:27,010 --> 02:41:28,648
he doesn't exist, he's a dream.

2771
02:41:28,712 --> 02:41:30,885
He was still struggling at the end to get out.

2772
02:41:30,947 --> 02:41:35,054
I think it's one of the things about a bad guy:
that is, you can't kill him.

2773
02:41:35,118 --> 02:41:36,563
You can make as many as you like.

2774
02:41:36,620 --> 02:41:43,196
After four hugely successful "Nightmares",
each one having outperformed the last, "The Dream Child"

2775
02:41:43,260 --> 02:41:50,075
was released less than a year after its predecessor
on August 11 <i>,</i> 1989 to generally negative reviews,

2776
02:41:50,133 --> 02:41:53,444
becoming the lowest grossing film of the series.

2777
02:41:53,503 --> 02:41:57,918
People forget, "Nightmare on Elm Street 5"
was a success - it was even a hit --

2778
02:41:57,974 --> 02:41:59,419
it just wasn't a blockbuster.

2779
02:41:59,476 --> 02:42:02,082
I think it came out very quickly after "4"

2780
02:42:02,145 --> 02:42:05,718
and I'm not sure ifthafs, you know,
it's a little less of an event.

2781
02:42:05,782 --> 02:42:09,127
Stephen did a lot of wonderful,
disorienting work on that.

2782
02:42:09,186 --> 02:42:15,865
I thought he did a wonderful job,
so I wouldn't blame necessarily any of the people

2783
02:42:15,926 --> 02:42:17,234
making the movie.

2784
02:42:17,294 --> 02:42:20,832
Maybe it was the fact that Freddy was a little played out.

2785
02:42:20,897 --> 02:42:23,343
This was a period mmere, fans will tell you,

2786
02:42:23,400 --> 02:42:25,175
the series was in decline.

2787
02:42:25,235 --> 02:42:30,878
And I tried to live up to the promise that I made to the fans
that we were not going to make a movie that

2788
02:42:30,941 --> 02:42:32,249
we did not think was going to be good,

2789
02:42:32,309 --> 02:42:35,222
"5" was arguably lame.

2790
02:42:35,278 --> 02:42:39,920
Honestly I wish it was scarier. If it's a series,
you have to work really hard at

2791
02:42:39,983 --> 02:42:44,193
keeping it at what it's original roots were
and I think it kind of strayed fiom that.

2792
02:42:44,254 --> 02:42:46,234
As an ongoing narrative

2793
02:42:46,289 --> 02:42:47,700
of what happens to everybody

2794
02:42:47,758 --> 02:42:49,032
on Elm Street,

2795
02:42:49,092 --> 02:42:51,595
probably a lesser movie in the canon.

2796
02:42:51,661 --> 02:42:54,904
I have to take some of the blame for

2797
02:42:54,965 --> 02:42:58,003
"Nightmare 5" not working
since the story was so much a pan of

2798
02:42:58,068 --> 02:43:00,048
what I wanted to say.

2799
02:43:00,103 --> 02:43:05,143
They touched on some really serious issues.
Abortion. I mean, that's heavy.

2800
02:43:05,208 --> 02:43:09,054
I don't think it was the "Pro-choice Nightmare."
I think it was like

2801
02:43:09,112 --> 02:43:14,084
controversy for controversy's sake
and if we made a political point, fine.

2802
02:43:14,151 --> 02:43:16,597
So it's like the "Juno" of horror movies. (laughing)

2803
02:43:16,653 --> 02:43:19,031
I guess she should have aborted him, right?

2804
02:43:19,089 --> 02:43:20,534
Maybe it shows abortion's a good thing. (laughing)

2805
02:43:36,139 --> 02:43:40,554
After the disappointment of "The Dream Child,"
New Line Cinema found itself at a crossroads with

2806
02:43:40,610 --> 02:43:44,854
the future of Freddy Krueger,
prompting their boldest move yet.

2807
02:43:44,915 --> 02:43:49,057
Frankly, like with everything in the world,
it's time to move on. I mean, we were

2808
02:43:49,119 --> 02:43:52,657
truly running out of good ideas
and I sensed that.

2809
02:43:52,722 --> 02:43:56,363
And so they wanted to do, you know,
what could they do to go outwith a bang.

2810
02:43:56,426 --> 02:44:01,535
The only way now to revive it after "5"
hadn't been as successful, is let's make sure that

2811
02:44:01,598 --> 02:44:04,306
everyone knew it was the last "Nightmare."

2812
02:44:04,367 --> 02:44:07,814
So it will be the end of Freddy,
we'll kill off Freddy and it's the end.

2813
02:44:07,871 --> 02:44:09,475
There was always multiple drafts going

2814
02:44:09,539 --> 02:44:14,318
and I had been a big, big fan of a young
New Zealand filmmaker by the name of Peter Jackson

2815
02:44:14,377 --> 02:44:17,256
and I'd been talking him up for a while
and I made the case.

2816
02:44:17,314 --> 02:44:21,353
Peter and his -- he had a writing partner at that time
named Danny Mulharen --

2817
02:44:21,418 --> 02:44:22,920
the two of them wrote a script.

2818
02:44:22,986 --> 02:44:28,834
Peter Jackson, actually, he tu med out a draft of "Elm Street 6."

2819
02:44:28,892 --> 02:44:32,135
He was in our ofï¬‚ce typing away at the time.

2820
02:44:32,195 --> 02:44:35,335
In his conception Freddy is this kind of.

2821
02:44:35,398 --> 02:44:38,242
Tired, decrepit figure. No one takes him
seriously anymore.

2822
02:44:38,301 --> 02:44:40,542
In fact, in the ultimate sort of insult,

2823
02:44:40,604 --> 02:44:45,383
kids put themselves to sleep with
laughing gas or sleeping pills just so they can go and

2824
02:44:45,442 --> 02:44:47,786
kick him and beat on him,
kind of "Clockwork Orange"-style.

2825
02:44:47,844 --> 02:44:51,849
That's what the kids of Elm Street do now
'cause he's such a joke.

2826
02:44:51,915 --> 02:44:58,059
And at one point, you know, Freddy sort of manages
to kill one of these kids, you know,

2827
02:44:58,121 --> 02:45:01,500
just enough to sort of get some energy back.

2828
02:45:01,558 --> 02:45:04,664
And there's a cop. He gets involved in
a fire in a house and is sort of

2829
02:45:04,728 --> 02:45:07,334
knocked out and ends up in a coma.

2830
02:45:07,397 --> 02:45:11,243
And because he's in the coma,
he's permanently in Freddy-world.

2831
02:45:11,301 --> 02:45:13,804
When "Nightmare 6" came up I basically said,

2832
02:45:13,870 --> 02:45:16,043
"Would you allow me to direct it?"

2833
02:45:16,106 --> 02:45:20,020
You've given me these promotions and
they expected me to come back and produce it.

2834
02:45:20,076 --> 02:45:23,023
So, Peter and Danny were writing this draft and

2835
02:45:23,079 --> 02:45:27,585
DeLuca was also writing a drafi
-- totally different -- and

2836
02:45:27,651 --> 02:45:29,688
that draft became "Freddy's Dead."

2837
02:45:29,753 --> 02:45:33,530
I said, "We shouldn't call it "Nightmare on Elm Street Part 6,"
we should call it "Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare,"

2838
02:45:33,590 --> 02:45:35,126
which everyone loved.

2839
02:45:35,191 --> 02:45:38,331
When the smoke cleared, everyone decided that
DeLuca's script for Rachel was the way to go.

2840
02:45:38,395 --> 02:45:43,003
But, you know, the great benefit of
what Peter and Danny did

2841
02:45:43,066 --> 02:45:48,846
is through that process of really working at New Line,
that sort of sealed Peters introduction

2842
02:45:48,905 --> 02:45:52,580
to Shaye and really laid the foundation for

2843
02:45:52,642 --> 02:45:55,179
what would come mu ch later,
which was "Lord of the Rings."

2844
02:45:55,245 --> 02:45:57,748
I was happy to do "6" because of Rachel.

2845
02:45:57,814 --> 02:46:01,591
Rachel was getting to direct.
I go way back to Roger Corman days with Rachel.

2846
02:46:01,651 --> 02:46:04,461
I was very excited to hear she was
directing one of them,

2847
02:46:04,521 --> 02:46:06,967
that's, I thought,
"Wow, that's a great story."

2848
02:46:07,023 --> 02:46:10,596
Going from sitting in an office desk
to going up to directing one of the films.

2849
02:46:10,660 --> 02:46:16,338
For the first time in Elm Street's history,
the story moved from suburban Springwood -

2850
02:46:16,399 --> 02:46:23,408
the now abandoned tov\m that Krueger had all but destroyed -
to an inner city shelterv\mere a young man with no memory,

2851
02:46:23,473 --> 02:46:29,424
a group of outcast teens and a woman with a secret,
battled Freddy once and for all.

2852
02:46:29,479 --> 02:46:31,459
It was very diff cult making the choice

2853
02:46:31,514 --> 02:46:32,720
of Shun Greenblatt.

2854
02:46:32,782 --> 02:46:37,697
I know that we had the most difficulty casting that pan
because the pan <i>was,</i> you know,

2855
02:46:37,754 --> 02:46:39,256
somebody who doesn't have a memory.

2856
02:46:39,322 --> 02:46:45,762
"Close up on an eighteen-year-old named John.
His face betrays a map of anxieties, an expression

2857
02:46:45,829 --> 02:46:47,604
better suited to a middle-aged neurotic."

2858
02:46:47,664 --> 02:46:53,239
You think I'm Freddy's son, that was the big hook.
You know, Freddy had a child, who was he,

2859
02:46:53,303 --> 02:46:54,839
how come I'm still alive

2860
02:46:54,904 --> 02:46:57,407
all the other kids are dead in Springwood.

2861
02:46:57,474 --> 02:47:02,890
Then using that as a catalyst for the story
and for Freddy's character,

2862
02:47:02,946 --> 02:47:04,118
to use me as a catalyst

2863
02:47:04,180 --> 02:47:05,659
to get out of Springwood

2864
02:47:05,715 --> 02:47:06,819
to torment the rest of the world.

2865
02:47:06,883 --> 02:47:11,229
The kids I remember because you fall in love with,
you know, you meet all these really interesting kids.

2866
02:47:11,287 --> 02:47:16,760
"Carlos, a 16-year-old deaf boy,
"narrates" like a sports commentator as Tracy

2867
02:47:16,826 --> 02:47:19,705
rigorously works out on a punching bag."

2868
02:47:19,763 --> 02:47:25,304
I was supposed to play the lead.
I was brought in to play Shun Greenblatfs pan.

2869
02:47:25,368 --> 02:47:28,713
When I read the script I just felt
more connected to Carlos.

2870
02:47:28,772 --> 02:47:33,016
I immediately clicked with the character
when I read it and that's how I do everything.

2871
02:47:33,076 --> 02:47:37,081
I guess you could say, you know,
worked out for me and worked out for him.

2872
02:47:37,147 --> 02:47:40,526
Then I got this wonderful actress,
Lezlie Deane, who starred

2873
02:47:40,583 --> 02:47:42,392
for me in "976-EVIL"

2874
02:47:42,452 --> 02:47:44,955
<i>New evocative of Jodie Foster 'amen she was young..</i>

2875
02:47:45,021 --> 02:47:48,434
"Maggie tums and moves toward
two security guards struggling with

2876
02:47:48,491 --> 02:47:50,835
a seventeen-year-old gin named Tracy."

2877
02:47:50,894 --> 02:47:54,740
Well I think Rachel read the scene with me and

2878
02:47:54,798 --> 02:47:57,608
we actually, you know, got up and started fighting.

2879
02:47:57,667 --> 02:48:01,945
We got like a little like, "yeah, yeah, yeah."
It got aggressive, I mean, you know

2880
02:48:02,005 --> 02:48:03,245
in a safe kind ofway, but it was really,

2881
02:48:03,306 --> 02:48:06,549
that was actually one of the
funnest interviews I'd ever done before.

2882
02:48:06,609 --> 02:48:09,317
Breckin Meyers an amazing guy.

2883
02:48:09,379 --> 02:48:12,019
He's come a long way,
he's got a great career going right now.

2884
02:48:12,082 --> 02:48:17,657
He's a good guy. Lezlie Deane's one of my best fiiends.
We all stayed connected, which was really cool.

2885
02:48:17,720 --> 02:48:20,200
Me and Ricky and Breckin, I mean,
we were like

2886
02:48:20,256 --> 02:48:21,257
three peas in a pod.

2887
02:48:21,324 --> 02:48:22,428
You couldn't separate us.

2888
02:48:22,492 --> 02:48:25,564
Then we got class actors in there,
like Lisa Zane and

2889
02:48:25,628 --> 02:48:28,108
Yaphet Kotto giving it gravitas.

2890
02:48:28,164 --> 02:48:32,237
"We see that Maggie's a striking woman,
lucky enough to possess that rare combination

2891
02:48:32,302 --> 02:48:34,543
of beauty, strength, and confidence."

2892
02:48:34,604 --> 02:48:40,577
She <i>was,</i> you know, somehow innerly compelled
to protect children, not knowing what

2893
02:48:40,643 --> 02:48:41,644
her own secret was yet.

2894
02:48:41,711 --> 02:48:45,488
Lisa Zane I really liked for the pan
because she had this sort of waif-like feel that

2895
02:48:45,548 --> 02:48:48,586
you sometimes thought she was quite lost.

2896
02:48:48,651 --> 02:48:51,928
You can't keep your eyes off her on the set.
She's like a cat, she's so feline.

2897
02:48:51,988 --> 02:48:54,594
And she would throw you offtrack.
You would never believe that she was

2898
02:48:54,657 --> 02:48:56,227
Freddy's daughter in some way.

2899
02:48:56,292 --> 02:48:57,566
<i>'They said,'</i>

2900
02:48:57,627 --> 02:48:59,197
"You're his daughter and
you get to kill him."

2901
02:48:59,262 --> 02:49:01,037
I was like, "Wow, alright.
That sounds pretty good.

2902
02:49:01,097 --> 02:49:02,974
Can I get that in m/riting?" (laughing)

2903
02:49:03,032 --> 02:49:08,175
If you're going to make a story about Freddy's daughter
then you're talking about the mythology to start with,

2904
02:49:08,238 --> 02:49:11,742
so that was basically where we
started with the original story ideas.

2905
02:49:11,808 --> 02:49:14,721
Rachel, you know, certainly had

2906
02:49:14,777 --> 02:49:18,782
a bit of a stain from her work with John Waters,
you know, she has that sensibility.

2907
02:49:18,848 --> 02:49:20,418
Let's not be coy about this.

2908
02:49:20,483 --> 02:49:22,759
A lot of the crew members were

2909
02:49:22,819 --> 02:49:24,821
John Waters crew members.

2910
02:49:24,888 --> 02:49:30,361
Our Prop Master at the time was married to Traci Lords. I mean,
you know, it just doesn't get any better than that. (laughing)

2911
02:49:30,426 --> 02:49:34,169
We set out to have fun on that movie and
there's stuff in that movie that I love.

2912
02:49:34,230 --> 02:49:35,641
The first scene

2913
02:49:35,698 --> 02:49:39,976
in the airplane, the beautiful,
robust actress to my right

2914
02:49:40,036 --> 02:49:44,644
was actually a replacement.
The original person who was supposed to do that role was

2915
02:49:44,707 --> 02:49:45,879
the great Divine,

2916
02:49:45,942 --> 02:49:49,048
who had passed away
right before we started shooting.

2917
02:49:49,112 --> 02:49:56,758
We intentionally made a decision, you know,
to kind of do a Warner Bros. cartoon.

2918
02:49:56,819 --> 02:49:59,060
It was just after "Twin Peaks" came out and so

2919
02:49:59,122 --> 02:50:02,763
there's a huge influence of "Twin Peaks" in it,
which is why I went toward humor, quirky humor

2920
02:50:02,825 --> 02:50:06,295
more than horror.

2921
02:50:06,362 --> 02:50:08,740
It does have a great sight gag, though,
when Freddy drags out

2922
02:50:08,798 --> 02:50:10,471
the big can of spikes.

2923
02:50:10,533 --> 02:50:11,978
That image in my mind

2924
02:50:12,035 --> 02:50:16,484
is like Bugs Bunny doing it in
some old Bugs Bunny cartoon that I loved.

2925
02:50:16,539 --> 02:50:20,248
There's a town just full of adults who are sad
because their children are gone and

2926
02:50:20,310 --> 02:50:23,621
seeing that carnival scene
with all the adults wandering

2927
02:50:23,680 --> 02:50:26,183
around kind of aimlessly and heartbroken.

2928
02:50:26,249 --> 02:50:28,695
The carnival scene was so creepy

2929
02:50:28,751 --> 02:50:30,753
because there weren't any kids left but us.

2930
02:50:30,820 --> 02:50:33,266
And we wanted it to be chock full of cameos.
We got

2931
02:50:33,323 --> 02:50:34,961
Tom and Roseanne in that,

2932
02:50:35,024 --> 02:50:38,233
who were like the biggest tabloid couple
in the world at that time.

2933
02:50:38,294 --> 02:50:40,501
Obviously they weren't doing it for the money
or anything else; they were doing it

2934
02:50:40,563 --> 02:50:41,735
because they were a fan of the series

2935
02:50:41,798 --> 02:50:43,937
and they were like wanting to be
a pan of the last one.

2936
02:50:44,000 --> 02:50:46,207
They just spent most of theirtime
pawing each other.

2937
02:50:46,269 --> 02:50:49,341
Dry humping each other
in the makeup trailer, you know. (laughing)

2938
02:50:49,405 --> 02:50:51,112
And I get kissed on the face

2939
02:50:51,174 --> 02:50:54,018
by Roseanne. I mean, that was amazing.

2940
02:50:54,077 --> 02:50:58,025
Unfortunately, we ended up keeping her
for like the whole day. I think she thought she'd be in

2941
02:50:58,081 --> 02:51:01,221
and out in two hours.
I think it was not a good experience for her.

2942
02:51:01,284 --> 02:51:04,697
One of the cool things was the kid Carlos

2943
02:51:04,754 --> 02:51:06,097
who wore the hearing aid.

2944
02:51:06,155 --> 02:51:10,467
"Aaaaahhh, mommy, not my ear!"

2945
02:51:10,526 --> 02:51:12,301
The q-tip from hell.

2946
02:51:12,362 --> 02:51:17,573
Any child who's ever had an earache
knows what it's like when somebody comes

2947
02:51:17,634 --> 02:51:18,942
towards you with a q-tip.

2948
02:51:19,002 --> 02:51:23,644
Canes' death, which I think is probably
the most effective death that I did in "Freddy's Dead."

2949
02:51:23,706 --> 02:51:25,811
We worked our butts off to do that.

2950
02:51:25,875 --> 02:51:27,616
I mean, just the makeup every day,

2951
02:51:27,677 --> 02:51:32,387
to put the earpiece on that you saw.
You know, I was in four hours of makeup

2952
02:51:32,448 --> 02:51:33,984
before we even started shooting.
We were shooting

2953
02:51:34,050 --> 02:51:36,496
in this electric plant

2954
02:51:36,552 --> 02:51:37,656
that was like the real deal.

2955
02:51:37,720 --> 02:51:39,859
We weren't allowed to get any blood in there,

2956
02:51:39,922 --> 02:51:41,765
but we had to blow the kid's head up.

2957
02:51:41,824 --> 02:51:45,135
It was sort of a "Scanners" kind of a deal.

2958
02:51:45,194 --> 02:51:48,835
And Bob wanted to do something more
interesting and he had this idea that we could

2959
02:51:48,898 --> 02:51:50,844
blow the head up like puzzle pieces.

2960
02:51:50,900 --> 02:51:52,811
Weird, organic head parts.

2961
02:51:52,869 --> 02:51:56,840
And I really now wish that we had done
something like that, that was more visual

2962
02:51:56,906 --> 02:51:58,010
and more interesting.

2963
02:51:58,074 --> 02:52:00,554
"Nice hearing from you, Canes." (laughing)

2964
02:52:00,810 --> 02:52:03,416
When Breckin did the whole
video game and got sucked into

2965
02:52:03,479 --> 02:52:07,950
the TV, and to see that mmole thing on set,
<i>was,</i> you know, was really cool.

2966
02:52:08,017 --> 02:52:10,497
Some of the scripts, the writers will indict

2967
02:52:10,553 --> 02:52:12,430
a particular teen fad and

2968
02:52:12,488 --> 02:52:14,434
Freddy kind of throws it back

2969
02:52:14,490 --> 02:52:16,629
at 'em, you know.
I mean, "Nightmare 6" when he <i>says,</i>

2970
02:52:16,693 --> 02:52:18,172
"Great graphics,"

2971
02:52:18,227 --> 02:52:20,366
you know, is like
one of the first gamerjokes ever.

2972
02:52:20,430 --> 02:52:23,172
Before the Wii,
Nintendo had this Power Glove

2973
02:52:23,232 --> 02:52:24,905
it didn't work at all, but

2974
02:52:24,967 --> 02:52:30,576
was this totally groovy looking glove,
and you sort of moved it around like the Wii and said,

2975
02:52:30,640 --> 02:52:32,210
"Now I'm playing with power."

2976
02:52:32,275 --> 02:52:35,552
And we wanted to use the Power Glove

2977
02:52:35,611 --> 02:52:40,685
and Nintendo said, "No." And Bob said,
"I don't care that they said no, I'm going to do it anyway."

2978
02:52:40,750 --> 02:52:43,731
"Now I'm playing with power."

2979
02:52:43,786 --> 02:52:49,429
I really want to do this and it's really a great line, but I think it's
really risky. Bob said, "I don't care," you know, "whatever."

2980
02:52:49,492 --> 02:52:54,771
And we used it and it's great and it sold more Power Gloves
and Nintendo never sued. (laughing)

2981
02:52:54,831 --> 02:52:57,607
But that's the kind of maverick Bob story that I absolutely love.

2982
02:52:57,667 --> 02:53:04,551
One of the more disturbing scenes in the movie
deals with child molestation.

2983
02:53:04,607 --> 02:53:07,087
It was really interesting whenever I shot

2984
02:53:07,143 --> 02:53:09,885
the scene with my father. I thought to myself,

2985
02:53:09,946 --> 02:53:14,122
"God this scene's coming really easy to me,
I don't have to go prepare for it or anything.

2986
02:53:14,183 --> 02:53:20,464
And I was like, that's cool in a way because it wasn't
really hard work. And then, maybe three weeks later

2987
02:53:20,523 --> 02:53:22,264
after that, I started getting ï¬‚ashes

2988
02:53:22,325 --> 02:53:24,100
of being molested. It was weird how

2989
02:53:24,160 --> 02:53:26,572
it just sort of pulled that scar back.

2990
02:53:26,629 --> 02:53:31,772
Ultimately, in her dream, she sort of realizes her fantasy

2991
02:53:31,834 --> 02:53:33,871
and she beats the crap out of this guy

2992
02:53:33,936 --> 02:53:35,244
that's been abusing her.

2993
02:53:35,304 --> 02:53:37,250
That scene actually changed my life.

2994
02:53:37,306 --> 02:53:39,809
It set me on a journey in life

2995
02:53:39,876 --> 02:53:43,653
of dealing with things and
dealing with my own fears.

2996
02:53:43,713 --> 02:53:47,820
So that scene right there was very poignant.

2997
02:53:47,884 --> 02:53:52,594
I think all that father-daughter stufiis nasty and cool
and no one could've come up with that but Rachel.

2998
02:53:52,789 --> 02:53:55,702
We were doing the fighting scene

2999
02:53:55,758 --> 02:53:59,763
and he went back like that to hit me
with his glove and he actually

3000
02:53:59,829 --> 02:54:01,331
hit me.

3001
02:54:01,397 --> 02:54:06,471
I had to go to the hospital, get stitches,
get a tetanus shot. So, I have a scar.

3002
02:54:06,536 --> 02:54:12,509
So that scar on me I get to look at every day
in the mirror and be reminded of Robert Englund.

3003
02:54:12,575 --> 02:54:14,384
Why does Lezlie Deane survive

3004
02:54:14,444 --> 02:54:17,857
in that movie? She has no business
surviving in that movie.

3005
02:54:17,914 --> 02:54:20,087
Way too many people survive in that movie.

3006
02:54:20,149 --> 02:54:20,786
It's ridiculous.

3007
02:54:20,983 --> 02:54:23,691
It was important to me to

3008
02:54:23,753 --> 02:54:25,630
come up with things that
expanded the mythology.

3009
02:54:25,688 --> 02:54:30,797
And I think that was important in order to kill Freddy,
that you had to understand more about his backstory.

3010
02:54:30,860 --> 02:54:32,737
And in the original script,

3011
02:54:32,795 --> 02:54:35,207
there was this sequence that was described as

3012
02:54:35,264 --> 02:54:38,211
"a Mr. Toad's Wild Ride through his psyche,"

3013
02:54:38,267 --> 02:54:40,076
and that sounded wild.

3014
02:54:40,136 --> 02:54:42,742
I thought it was a really clever way of

3015
02:54:42,805 --> 02:54:46,048
making you feel a little sorry for him or

3016
02:54:46,108 --> 02:54:48,884
vulnerable for a split second.

3017
02:54:48,945 --> 02:54:50,947
I get offers all the time to play villains in

3018
02:54:51,013 --> 02:54:55,962
certain things and, at that point, when they said
to play Freddy's father, I said, "Well,

3019
02:54:56,018 --> 02:54:58,157
as long as I don't have to look like Alice Cooper.

3020
02:54:58,221 --> 02:55:03,170
If I can look like a hayseed,
really degenerate, old drunk."

3021
02:55:03,226 --> 02:55:04,864
I thought I'd play the most disgusting

3022
02:55:04,927 --> 02:55:06,531
father I can play.

3023
02:55:06,596 --> 02:55:11,375
The coolest thing ever (laughing)
was getting Alice Cooper and

3024
02:55:11,434 --> 02:55:13,004
the most excited I'd ever seen the crew.

3025
02:55:13,069 --> 02:55:16,346
I mean, the crews excited to see
Johnny Depp and all that,

3026
02:55:16,405 --> 02:55:20,353
but, the crew having Alice Cooper on set
was like, "Aaaahhhh!"

3027
02:55:20,409 --> 02:55:25,688
I always knew they'd find a way
to blame me for Freddy. (laughing)

3028
02:55:25,748 --> 02:55:27,056
I got blamed for the Vietnam War, for everything else.

3029
02:55:27,316 --> 02:55:32,231
That was very cooLA lot of people wanted
to killAlice Cooper, you know, early on in his career,

3030
02:55:32,288 --> 02:55:33,392
and I got to.

3031
02:55:33,456 --> 02:55:39,270
Tobe Sexton, who played young Freddy,
really had it dovm.

3032
02:55:39,328 --> 02:55:42,468
To play the young version of Freddy Krueger
was something I really took seriously and

3033
02:55:42,532 --> 02:55:48,915
something I really took time to, like, work on.
And, actually, I met up with Robert Englund and

3034
02:55:48,971 --> 02:55:53,920
found out about the character, how he did the voice,
where he kind of brought it from.

3035
02:55:53,976 --> 02:55:56,957
'Cause I thinkthafs kind of the essence of Freddy.

3036
02:55:57,013 --> 02:55:58,549
And he really did play it well.

3037
02:55:58,614 --> 02:56:02,221
He really had the eyes down on the mmole thing.

3038
02:56:02,285 --> 02:56:05,630
There was a secondary scene there
where he goes after me with a blade,

3039
02:56:05,688 --> 02:56:07,292
but maybe it was too heavy.

3040
02:56:07,356 --> 02:56:08,926
"Go inside honey."

3041
02:56:08,991 --> 02:56:11,096
You see Freddy and his daughter,

3042
02:56:11,160 --> 02:56:13,800
you see her as a little girl in that creepy backyard.

3043
02:56:13,863 --> 02:56:15,433
Working on this film as a little girl, was a really

3044
02:56:15,498 --> 02:56:18,445
terrifying experience, to say the least. (laughing)

3045
02:56:18,501 --> 02:56:21,243
This is supposed to be my father and he's,
you know, brutally murdering

3046
02:56:21,304 --> 02:56:22,681
my mother, banging her head against the

3047
02:56:22,738 --> 02:56:25,514
house. And seeing that, the tears just kind of

3048
02:56:25,575 --> 02:56:28,488
started to ï¬‚ow.

3049
02:56:28,544 --> 02:56:34,085
You know, I just went with it and tried
to imagine that that uvas really happening.

3050
02:56:34,150 --> 02:56:39,930
For Kruegefis last stand, New Line Cinema tried
to live up to the promise to save the best for last,

3051
02:56:39,989 --> 02:56:44,734
employing a gimmick that would make
Freddy's finale trulyjump off the screen.

3052
02:56:44,794 --> 02:56:50,972
There's the great thing that Rachel came up with
and for me, it's that wonderful 3-D sequence.

3053
02:56:51,033 --> 02:56:54,310
The 3-D element <i>was,</i> again, a gimmick

3054
02:56:54,370 --> 02:56:57,249
that we thought could revive the series.

3055
02:56:57,306 --> 02:56:59,877
This idea of doing the last ten minutes in 3-D,

3056
02:56:59,942 --> 02:57:02,980
which was a tremendously complex technology at that point.

3057
02:57:03,045 --> 02:57:06,083
I don't kn ow if the 3-D was really all that effective.

3058
02:57:06,148 --> 02:57:09,152
The audience didn't know when
to put on the glasses, they weren't sure

3059
02:57:09,218 --> 02:57:10,595
when they were supposed to do it.

3060
02:57:10,653 --> 02:57:15,602
When Maggie in the film puts on her 3-D glasses
that's wnen you put on yours, at the very end

3061
02:57:15,658 --> 02:57:20,038
"You're going to need these 3-D
glasses to navigate the dreamscape.

3062
02:57:20,096 --> 02:57:21,473
Put 'em on now."

3063
02:57:21,530 --> 02:57:23,771
It was funny to watch people, like, that didn't know,

3064
02:57:23,833 --> 02:57:26,245
were going, "What's wrong with the screen."

3065
02:57:26,302 --> 02:57:28,248
They're like, "You're supposed to put on the glasses."
They're like, "Oh, okay."

3066
02:57:28,304 --> 02:57:32,775
How about Freddy Kru eger
in IMAX in 3-D like "Avatar"? (laughing)

3067
02:57:32,842 --> 02:57:37,313
We actually did some groundbreaking work
at that point on the technology,

3068
02:57:37,380 --> 02:57:38,222
but a lot of it didn't work.

3069
02:57:38,280 --> 02:57:39,987
She just had mejut some things

3070
02:57:40,049 --> 02:57:41,426
toward camera

3071
02:57:41,484 --> 02:57:43,020
in an unnatural wvay a few times.

3072
02:57:43,085 --> 02:57:46,032
This camera was like huge and
it was like a million dollar camera.

3073
02:57:46,088 --> 02:57:48,694
You had to be so precise

3074
02:57:48,758 --> 02:57:50,499
in hitting your marks,

3075
02:57:50,559 --> 02:57:51,970
otherwise the whole gag wouldn't work.

3076
02:57:52,028 --> 02:57:54,668
Rachel was really on the cutting edge and,

3077
02:57:54,730 --> 02:57:57,210
you know, the little dream

3078
02:57:57,266 --> 02:57:59,143
demons that she wanted in there

3079
02:57:59,201 --> 02:58:01,044
they were all CGI

3080
02:58:01,103 --> 02:58:03,049
in a time where nobody did CGI.

3081
02:58:03,105 --> 02:58:04,675
<i>PM was into he'</i>

3082
02:58:04,740 --> 02:58:08,916
beginning of the computer technology because
they were working with, they had been working

3083
02:58:08,978 --> 02:58:13,188
with Jim Cameron on "Terminator 2." And at one point -
and they'll kill me for telling this story -

3084
02:58:13,249 --> 02:58:15,855
they sent us a clip from "Terminator 2"

3085
02:58:15,918 --> 02:58:17,898
with our footage of Arnold on the bike.

3086
02:58:17,953 --> 02:58:22,368
Jim Cameron would never, like that would be
the end of our career forever, if he ever knew

3087
02:58:22,425 --> 02:58:25,338
that one piece of his footage got out by mistake.

3088
02:58:25,394 --> 02:58:28,000
I'm like, "I'm cutting this into my film." (laughing)

3089
02:58:28,064 --> 02:58:30,271
I love the fight, the big fight to the death, though.

3090
02:58:30,332 --> 02:58:31,834
That was my favorite.

3091
02:58:31,901 --> 02:58:33,312
It wasn't clearly

3092
02:58:33,369 --> 02:58:35,610
imagined, in terms of what awful things

3093
02:58:35,671 --> 02:58:37,480
they'd be doing to each other,

3094
02:58:37,540 --> 02:58:39,315
so, a lot of it was sort of

3095
02:58:39,375 --> 02:58:41,821
invented there on the set.

3096
02:58:41,877 --> 02:58:44,187
And I'm having to hold this, like, pipe bomb

3097
02:58:44,246 --> 02:58:45,554
with the sparkles coming out.

3098
02:58:45,614 --> 02:58:47,184
And we're gonna blow up Freddy

3099
02:58:47,249 --> 02:58:50,128
and <i>his,</i> you know, <i>snot,</i> blood and
bones is gonna be all over your lap.

3100
02:58:53,823 --> 02:58:54,824
We blew the shit out of him.

3101
02:58:54,890 --> 02:58:58,167
And in Freddy's case I would argue,
at some level, his death

3102
02:58:58,227 --> 02:58:59,535
in "The Dream Master" and

3103
02:58:59,595 --> 02:59:02,371
in "Dream Warriors" are
more fitting final deaths

3104
02:59:02,431 --> 02:59:04,240
than the death he gets in

3105
02:59:04,300 --> 02:59:06,871
Given the fact that we've done
several others alter--

3106
02:59:06,936 --> 02:59:10,179
Freddy didn't really die -- it makes
that one look a little more

3107
02:59:10,239 --> 02:59:13,118
facetious, I guess, in its execution.

3108
02:59:13,175 --> 02:59:19,785
On September 13, 1991, fans swarmed
to the final "Nightmare" and the film delivered

3109
02:59:19,849 --> 02:59:24,696
a box office take that showed even in death,
there might still be some life left in Freddy.

3110
02:59:24,754 --> 02:59:29,635
As one of the publicity stunts for the film,
they created Freddy's funeral.

3111
02:59:29,692 --> 02:59:31,262
Freddy's funeral was held

3112
02:59:31,327 --> 02:59:32,670
at the Hollywood Forever Cemetary

3113
02:59:32,728 --> 02:59:35,265
kind of to put a cap on the whole

3114
02:59:35,331 --> 02:59:37,140
wand of Freddy Krueger.

3115
02:59:37,199 --> 02:59:40,373
They brought the press in and
we all had to stand over a fake coffin

3116
02:59:40,436 --> 02:59:43,042
with Freddy's stuff all around it.

3117
02:59:43,105 --> 02:59:45,244
And I had to go and look mournful.

3118
02:59:45,307 --> 02:59:48,151
There was a bunch of other cast members from other

3119
02:59:48,210 --> 02:59:50,520
movies of the "Elm Street" series there.

3120
02:59:50,579 --> 02:59:52,525
It was like a big reunion.

3121
02:59:52,581 --> 02:59:55,084
It was like a burial, like a real burial deal.

3122
02:59:55,151 --> 02:59:58,928
It was a really clever way, once again,
of them promoting the film, of going,

3123
02:59:58,988 --> 03:00:00,399
<i>"Guys, this is it. </i>

3124
03:00:00,456 --> 03:00:02,663
This is the last one. He's dead and gone."

3125
03:00:02,725 --> 03:00:04,762
Freddy's really dead this time. Not.

3126
03:00:04,827 --> 03:00:07,603
I remember seeing on Fifth Avenue a bus rolls by and

3127
03:00:07,663 --> 03:00:10,109
there was the poster "Freddy is Dead," and I said,

3128
03:00:10,166 --> 03:00:13,704
"Well, it must mean that they've milked the
cow as much as they could," you know. (laughing)

3129
03:00:13,769 --> 03:00:17,410
it wasn't standing very tall itself and then,
so after that, we realized that

3130
03:00:17,473 --> 03:00:19,316
we were at the end of the line.

3131
03:00:19,375 --> 03:00:25,018
We jumped the shark a little. I'm not going to denythat.
But we wanted to. We wanted to do the movie we made.

3132
03:00:25,080 --> 03:00:27,458
"I'll get you, my pretty!"

3133
03:00:27,516 --> 03:00:29,655
"And you're little dog, too!"

3134
03:00:29,718 --> 03:00:32,221
But it may have been a mistake
to take it so humorous. I think

3135
03:00:32,288 --> 03:00:35,565
we shouldve gone from the humor into something

3136
03:00:35,624 --> 03:00:36,796
that was more scary.

3137
03:00:36,859 --> 03:00:38,930
I think because we thought it was gonna be

3138
03:00:38,994 --> 03:00:43,204
the last one, I think it was okay to kind of deconstruct

3139
03:00:43,265 --> 03:00:44,835
and self-destruct.

3140
03:00:44,900 --> 03:00:48,643
I told everyone it was going to be the last one, of course,
but I didn't know. (laughing)

3141
03:00:48,737 --> 03:00:50,683
"Freddy's dead."

3142
03:00:50,773 --> 03:00:53,508
<i>"Is there any chance he's going to be coming back?"</i>

3143
03:00:53,509 --> 03:00:55,318
No.
No, no, no.

3144
03:00:55,411 --> 03:00:58,046
No, no, no.
No.

3145
03:00:58,047 --> 03:00:59,681
<i>'(Freddys evil laughter)'</i>

3146
03:00:59,682 --> 03:00:59,784
<i>'(Freddys evil laughter)'</i>

3147
03:01:11,927 --> 03:01:13,702
Now that Freddy was dead and buried

3148
03:01:13,762 --> 03:01:17,642
and with the tenth anniversary of
the original "Elm Street" approaching,

3149
03:01:17,700 --> 03:01:24,379
the inevitable question was raised:
Could everyone's favorite boogeyman be resurrected again?

3150
03:01:24,440 --> 03:01:27,216
The answer to that question would
come from Wes Craven himself,

3151
03:01:27,276 --> 03:01:30,917
who conceived a radical new approach to the story.

3152
03:01:30,980 --> 03:01:36,521
Most people say their sequels are the last sequels
that are going to <i>be</i> made and then they make ten more.

3153
03:01:36,585 --> 03:01:40,431
We didn't know that we were going
to be able to work with Wes again.

3154
03:01:40,489 --> 03:01:44,699
And the way "New Nightmare" happened was
I got a call from Bob Shaye out of the blue.

3155
03:01:44,760 --> 03:01:47,900
And, to his credit, he said,

3156
03:01:47,963 --> 03:01:53,037
"I've heard some interviews with you saying you felt you
didn't get a fair shake and I'd like to try to make that better."

3157
03:01:53,102 --> 03:01:54,775
And he did. He went back

3158
03:01:54,837 --> 03:02:00,048
and gave me retroactive cuts in sequels and he
also gave me a little bit of the merchandising, and <i>so</i> forth.

3159
03:02:00,109 --> 03:02:02,555
Wes and I had ironed out our differences

3160
03:02:02,611 --> 03:02:06,491
and I was anxious to do something with Wes.

3161
03:02:06,548 --> 03:02:08,027
And he said, "Look,

3162
03:02:08,083 --> 03:02:15,331
we killed Freddy, we admit it. We said he was dead forever,
but we thought maybe there's one more film there."

3163
03:02:15,391 --> 03:02:21,535
Wes has to come back and answer his critics
and finally put the nail in the coffin, and

3164
03:02:21,597 --> 03:02:23,474
apologize a little bit for "Freddy's Dead."

3165
03:02:23,532 --> 03:02:26,308
I went off and looked at all the other films and said,

3166
03:02:26,368 --> 03:02:28,143
I don't know how I can make any sense of it.

3167
03:02:28,203 --> 03:02:30,809
And then it kind of jumped the shark and thought,

3168
03:02:30,873 --> 03:02:33,615
I'll do it about all the different people who
participated in the first one.

3169
03:02:33,676 --> 03:02:38,921
There was the idea, well, Robert's not Freddy, you know,
Freddy is Freddy. Freddy is an entity unto itself,

3170
03:02:38,981 --> 03:02:42,690
that is now out of control and, once again,

3171
03:02:42,751 --> 03:02:43,786
it is allowed to be terrifying.

3172
03:02:43,852 --> 03:02:44,956
"Miss me?"

3173
03:02:45,020 --> 03:02:48,866
Because there was no place else logically
to go that was original and suddenly it was like,

3174
03:02:48,924 --> 03:02:50,232
"Wait a minute. We can do this

3175
03:02:50,292 --> 03:02:51,965
and make some interesting comments."

3176
03:02:52,027 --> 03:02:58,000
Bringing a menace into the real world
from your imagination and having

3177
03:02:58,067 --> 03:02:59,512
that menace not go away,

3178
03:02:59,568 --> 03:03:01,570
is a terrific idea.

3179
03:03:01,637 --> 03:03:06,382
It was so special and unique that it was
worth reviving the whole series.

3180
03:03:06,442 --> 03:03:12,449
I was very consciously taking the reality of the first film
and bringing it over into "real life" in a way

3181
03:03:12,514 --> 03:03:14,050
that it was always quoting the original.

3182
03:03:15,084 --> 03:03:16,084
<i>(screaming)</i>

3183
03:03:16,085 --> 03:03:20,321
Well, it was really cool to see my name in a script.

3184
03:03:20,322 --> 03:03:24,634
But then after I digested the uvhole idea, then I thought,

3185
03:03:24,693 --> 03:03:30,006
"Well, you know, average people are going to think that this is
really about me and this is my story or something like that."

3186
03:03:30,065 --> 03:03:32,739
Heather had gone on and done a television series,

3187
03:03:32,801 --> 03:03:34,576
"Just the Ten of Us,"

3188
03:03:34,636 --> 03:03:36,775
which was very, very sort of mom-and-apple-pie-ish.

3189
03:03:36,839 --> 03:03:40,480
Just by coincidence -- and it wasn't planned
on the pan of the producers or anything -

3190
03:03:40,542 --> 03:03:42,681
three of us had been on
"Nightmare on Elm Street" movies.

3191
03:03:42,745 --> 03:03:46,124
So it was definitely a running inside joke on the set.

3192
03:03:46,181 --> 03:03:50,027
This looks like something out of "Nightmare on Elm Street"

3193
03:03:50,085 --> 03:03:55,967
I still get all of these letters from people
with this fascination of the Lubbock babes from

3194
03:03:56,025 --> 03:03:58,335
"Just the Ten of Us" all being Freddy Krueger

3195
03:03:58,394 --> 03:03:59,737
you know, victims.

3196
03:03:59,795 --> 03:04:04,676
As it turns out, a stalker that had started, you know,
calling Heather at all odd hours and

3197
03:04:04,733 --> 03:04:06,269
threatening her life,

3198
03:04:06,335 --> 03:04:11,114
turned out to be a fan who was ticked off
because the series had been stopped.

3199
03:04:11,173 --> 03:04:17,749
And, as a result, I ended up moving to London
for a couple, maybe five months just getting axnray from it all.

3200
03:04:17,813 --> 03:04:21,522
And it struck me as such an incredible irony
that everybody had been telling me

3201
03:04:21,583 --> 03:04:23,494
my mmole career that, "What you're writing is bad

3202
03:04:23,552 --> 03:04:25,259
and it's going to make people want
to go out and kill somebody."

3203
03:04:25,320 --> 03:04:26,594
And it was afan of this

3204
03:04:26,655 --> 03:04:29,329
very bland show that actually
tumed out to be threatening.

3205
03:04:29,391 --> 03:04:31,166
And so this idea,

3206
03:04:31,226 --> 03:04:34,469
I think it was maybe some food
for Wes' thought process.

3207
03:04:34,530 --> 03:04:38,501
Wes came to me and said he had been
talking to Heather a little bit about how

3208
03:04:38,567 --> 03:04:42,140
if he can delve into her private life
and put some of it on the screen

3209
03:04:42,204 --> 03:04:45,549
and would I mind if he screwed around
with me a little bit.

3210
03:04:45,607 --> 03:04:50,818
There was a theme of how this actual movie
we had all participated in had kind of

3211
03:04:50,879 --> 03:04:53,587
haunted our lives and, in a sense, made it

3212
03:04:53,649 --> 03:04:56,630
like we could not be something
totally different from that film ever.

3213
03:04:56,685 --> 03:05:00,656
So I said, "Yeah, count me in,"
you know, "I'm on board."

3214
03:05:00,722 --> 03:05:02,360
And then I saw the script and I loved it.

3215
03:05:02,424 --> 03:05:04,495
I pitched that to Bob and
I remember just thinking and saying,

3216
03:05:04,560 --> 03:05:06,005
"And Bob, you'll have a big scene."

3217
03:05:06,061 --> 03:05:09,042
(laughing) He <i>says,</i> "Ah, I kind of like that."

3218
03:05:09,098 --> 03:05:11,942
I don't think I did a particularly good job,
but it was okay.

3219
03:05:12,000 --> 03:05:14,606
"Oh come on, Heather, kids love horror."

3220
03:05:14,670 --> 03:05:17,014
It was kind of like a valentine to

3221
03:05:17,072 --> 03:05:18,244
the fans.

3222
03:05:18,307 --> 03:05:20,218
And, at the sametime,
it was a great reunion for us.

3223
03:05:20,275 --> 03:05:21,879
And also I think we all got to go,

3224
03:05:21,944 --> 03:05:23,389
"What have we done?"

3225
03:05:23,445 --> 03:05:29,521
It was like everybody that worked on the first one
had come back and it was just

3226
03:05:29,585 --> 03:05:31,155
interesting to see how they'd grown

3227
03:05:31,220 --> 03:05:32,893
and how their careers had changed.

3228
03:05:32,955 --> 03:05:35,526
Coming back to work with Wes is always a treat.

3229
03:05:35,591 --> 03:05:37,696
I came back, not as a teacher, but as a nurse,

3230
03:05:37,759 --> 03:05:42,333
so, but, it was still one of those generic public servants.
(laughing)

3231
03:05:42,397 --> 03:05:44,138
John Saxon had renaissanced, yet again.

3232
03:05:44,199 --> 03:05:49,239
This guy's the guy that's worked with
everybody from Elvis to Quentin Tarantino and Robert Redford

3233
03:05:49,304 --> 03:05:51,614
and Bruce Lee and Freddy Krueger and everybody else.

3234
03:05:51,673 --> 03:05:54,244
I suppose I imagined it might be the last.

3235
03:05:54,309 --> 03:05:56,550
It sounded like a fin ale.

3236
03:05:56,612 --> 03:05:59,183
All the other directors had been first-timers

3237
03:05:59,248 --> 03:06:00,852
and they had to be

3238
03:06:00,916 --> 03:06:02,896
helped through a little bit, but

3239
03:06:02,951 --> 03:06:05,932
Wes <i>was,</i> by then, the master.

3240
03:06:05,988 --> 03:06:07,695
It was a very pleasant film. I remember

3241
03:06:07,756 --> 03:06:12,102
how fun it was and what a sense of
love there was on the set.

3242
03:06:12,161 --> 03:06:16,837
Not to be mushy, but just everybody
really liked each other and was having

3243
03:06:16,899 --> 03:06:19,505
a great time.

3244
03:06:19,568 --> 03:06:24,313
<i>'(practical joke, laughter on set)'</i>

3245
03:06:24,373 --> 03:06:25,351
Heather Langenkamp

3246
03:06:25,407 --> 03:06:27,512
playing herself was so

3247
03:06:27,576 --> 03:06:31,285
smart and one of her best performances ever.

3248
03:06:31,346 --> 03:06:34,691
And she <i>was,</i> you know, a young mother
at the time and so finding all those

3249
03:06:34,750 --> 03:06:39,096
elements from her own reality, that she
could bring into the movie, worked so beautifully.

3250
03:06:39,154 --> 03:06:44,001
Some of the things that Wes kind of brought in
that were similar, is that I'm married to a makeup artist.

3251
03:06:44,059 --> 03:06:47,871
"Chase Porter, good-looking, early 30s, tweaks the levers of a

3252
03:06:47,930 --> 03:06:49,500
remote control device."

3253
03:06:49,565 --> 03:06:52,546
I was playing Heather's real life husband, David, who was

3254
03:06:52,601 --> 03:06:57,243
Wes' special effects guy, who didn't want to play himself

3255
03:06:57,306 --> 03:07:00,082
because it would be a curse.
So, I was more concerned about the curse.

3256
03:07:00,142 --> 03:07:03,589
When lwent in and met all the real
special effects team that were doing the movie

3257
03:07:03,645 --> 03:07:09,652
and I met David, I realized, like, lwasthe least
non-special effects looking guy on the planet. They're like

3258
03:07:09,718 --> 03:07:10,992
blue-collar, hardworking,

3259
03:07:11,053 --> 03:07:13,897
beard. They all had heavy metal T-shins on,

3260
03:07:13,956 --> 03:07:16,630
they all looked like they hadn't slept in about nine years.

3261
03:07:16,692 --> 03:07:19,195
I'm like the dorkiest special effects guy ever.

3262
03:07:19,261 --> 03:07:25,212
"Behind them, at the edge of the set, Chase's wife,
Heather Langenkamp, 30, dressed in woman's pajamas,

3263
03:07:25,267 --> 03:07:26,507
and his son Dylan, 5,

3264
03:07:26,568 --> 03:07:28,411
watch from their ch airs."

3265
03:07:28,470 --> 03:07:30,746
I remember having a blast on this film.

3266
03:07:30,806 --> 03:07:33,013
This <i>was,</i> every day was an adventure.

3267
03:07:33,075 --> 03:07:37,023
Who doesn't want to be chased around
by Freddy when they're 7, like, for real.

3268
03:07:37,079 --> 03:07:38,558
We got along, you know,

3269
03:07:38,614 --> 03:07:42,824
just like mom and son.
And I <i>was,</i> of course, very protective ofhim.

3270
03:07:42,884 --> 03:07:44,454
He had some scenes where
he had to really go through

3271
03:07:44,519 --> 03:07:46,430
difficult emotional things.

3272
03:07:46,488 --> 03:07:52,632
And there was a time when his parents came to me and said,
"We have a way to make him cry and we don't like to do it

3273
03:07:52,694 --> 03:07:55,197
too often, but we'll do it." I said, "Okay, fine." And so

3274
03:07:55,264 --> 03:08:00,475
the mother lefi the set and the father Whispered in his ear
and said, "OK, your mothers dead." (laughing)

3275
03:08:00,535 --> 03:08:02,674
And after he'd go through some hellacious scene,

3276
03:08:02,738 --> 03:08:04,911
his reward was a Happy Meal.

3277
03:08:04,973 --> 03:08:07,852
I don't think horror movies or being a kid

3278
03:08:07,909 --> 03:08:11,447
in a horror movie is inherently bad or going to do any

3279
03:08:11,513 --> 03:08:14,494
psychological damage or anything like that.

3280
03:08:14,549 --> 03:08:20,124
All little kids do anyway is play pretend,
so if you can do it professionally, rock it.

3281
03:08:20,188 --> 03:08:24,193
"Heather opens the door to Julie, a direct, open-faced

3282
03:08:24,259 --> 03:08:25,431
young woman."

3283
03:08:25,494 --> 03:08:32,139
Even though most of the people in the film
had been in the original film, I didn't feel at all

3284
03:08:32,200 --> 03:08:35,044
like I wasn't a pan of the group
or pan of the ensemble.

3285
03:08:35,103 --> 03:08:36,639
In the original script that I read,

3286
03:08:36,705 --> 03:08:41,017
Julie, the babysitter, was a pawn of Freddy's.

3287
03:08:41,076 --> 03:08:43,386
Julie was the stalker, Julie was the one

3288
03:08:43,445 --> 03:08:44,981
harrassing them. Julie, yeah,

3289
03:08:45,047 --> 03:08:46,355
she was all those things.

3290
03:08:46,415 --> 03:08:51,888
Wes said to all of us that, "You might be the one
that's causing this," and so, but none of us really,

3291
03:08:51,953 --> 03:08:54,866
we didn't really need to know that in order to play the part.

3292
03:08:54,923 --> 03:09:00,896
I had done a number of films with David Cronenberg:
"Scanners," "Videodrome," The Dead Zone," "The Fly."

3293
03:09:00,962 --> 03:09:06,469
But Wes has a very narrow mind,
in the sense of this is what's going to scare people

3294
03:09:06,535 --> 03:09:08,572
and a broad mind to extract.

3295
03:09:08,637 --> 03:09:12,414
There's something that goes on in the
making of a horror film where you're dealing with these things

3296
03:09:12,474 --> 03:09:14,112
that in real life are terrifying

3297
03:09:14,176 --> 03:09:15,814
and sometimes morbid and horrible,

3298
03:09:15,877 --> 03:09:20,383
but by acting it out

3299
03:09:20,449 --> 03:09:24,420
you release some sort of childish laughter,
which is totally

3300
03:09:24,486 --> 03:09:26,591
contradictory from what you would expect, but it just

3301
03:09:26,655 --> 03:09:28,794
makes for a very tight-knit

3302
03:09:28,857 --> 03:09:30,234
crew and cast.

3303
03:09:30,292 --> 03:09:37,767
As pan ofWes Craven's darker reality-based "Nightmare,"
Freddy himself would undergo a major reinvention.

3304
03:09:37,833 --> 03:09:42,873
It was discussions with Wes
that Freddy was not to be the kind of

3305
03:09:42,938 --> 03:09:44,679
wisecracker that he had become.

3306
03:09:44,740 --> 03:09:49,587
I wanted it to be something that
was not quite what was in the movie.

3307
03:09:49,644 --> 03:09:51,385
He wanted it to be something different,

3308
03:09:51,446 --> 03:09:54,984
something new, more bulky, more muscular.
Everything on it was different.

3309
03:09:55,050 --> 03:09:56,461
It was supposed to be the real Freddy.

3310
03:09:56,518 --> 03:09:59,192
I felt it looked great to have him look that, kind of German,

3311
03:09:59,254 --> 03:10:01,165
sleek.

3312
03:10:01,223 --> 03:10:03,567
He's not really burned in that one, like, his skin

3313
03:10:03,625 --> 03:10:06,765
is split, like you'd see in a real anatomy book.

3314
03:10:06,828 --> 03:10:10,002
This was an actual, real hand and

3315
03:10:10,065 --> 03:10:12,875
real blades that grew out of his fingertips.

3316
03:10:12,934 --> 03:10:15,039
It was a whole different design and

3317
03:10:15,103 --> 03:10:16,582
I thought it was kind of an interesting look.

3318
03:10:16,638 --> 03:10:19,244
What I found out from Robert was

3319
03:10:19,307 --> 03:10:22,117
that the thumb was a little clumsy

3320
03:10:22,177 --> 03:10:24,885
to work with when it had a blade on it, but

3321
03:10:24,946 --> 03:10:25,981
it looked good.

3322
03:10:26,047 --> 03:10:28,152
Sometimes I think it was smart,

3323
03:10:28,216 --> 03:10:29,661
sometimes I think it was a mistake.

3324
03:10:29,718 --> 03:10:33,598
I don't know. I've gone around and around
with that in my mind over the years.

3325
03:10:33,655 --> 03:10:36,067
The opening of "New Nightmare"

3326
03:10:36,124 --> 03:10:38,627
is actually a tribute to Roman Polanski's

3327
03:10:38,693 --> 03:10:40,229
"Repulsion."

3328
03:10:40,295 --> 03:10:45,244
When the woman first starts to go mad,
the walls of her apartment crack.

3329
03:10:45,300 --> 03:10:49,612
Of course, we shot the earthquake scene
where I'm in bed with Chase and

3330
03:10:49,671 --> 03:10:51,241
then we're rocked out of bed

3331
03:10:51,306 --> 03:10:52,546
by this earthquake,

3332
03:10:52,607 --> 03:10:54,678
probably the first or second day.

3333
03:10:54,743 --> 03:10:57,189
And then we did have that
very devastating earthquake.

3334
03:10:57,245 --> 03:11:01,284
On January 17th was
the big Northridge quake.

3335
03:11:01,349 --> 03:11:02,692
A lot of us had close calls.

3336
03:11:02,751 --> 03:11:06,597
When we came to the set, the crew
just looked at me like,

3337
03:11:06,655 --> 03:11:09,602
"What are you making a date
with the devil or something?" (laughing)

3338
03:11:09,658 --> 03:11:12,730
At that point everybody thought,
well, it's game on. We basically,

3339
03:11:12,794 --> 03:11:14,967
we've opened Pandora's Box.

3340
03:11:15,030 --> 03:11:16,976
This was the reality that was invading our movie.

3341
03:11:17,032 --> 03:11:20,445
Fact and fiction were strangely combining.

3342
03:11:20,502 --> 03:11:23,483
This is great. We're all gonna die. It's fantastic.

3343
03:11:23,538 --> 03:11:25,643
But what was interesting <i>was,</i> Wes was able to

3344
03:11:25,707 --> 03:11:27,550
work that into the movie.

3345
03:11:27,609 --> 03:11:29,589
We got a secondary crew

3346
03:11:29,644 --> 03:11:30,952
and went out and shot second unit

3347
03:11:31,012 --> 03:11:33,322
because we're never gonna get
shots like this otherwise.

3348
03:11:33,381 --> 03:11:37,329
There were jackets that were given
to the cast and crew that had Freddy on the back.

3349
03:11:37,385 --> 03:11:42,061
They had "7.1" put in the corner because it
was right after North ridge.

3350
03:11:42,123 --> 03:11:44,103
We have the one scene

3351
03:11:44,159 --> 03:11:46,400
mmere I go to the TV studio to have the interview

3352
03:11:46,461 --> 03:11:48,964
and then Freddy shows up and he's in makeup.

3353
03:11:49,030 --> 03:11:50,737
Being on a talk show as Freddy,

3354
03:11:50,799 --> 03:11:53,302
you know, really just being a whore

3355
03:11:53,368 --> 03:11:58,374
and working the crowd with the Freddy fanatics,
which of course is all true. There really were those things.

3356
03:11:58,440 --> 03:11:59,714
Robert Englund and I

3357
03:11:59,774 --> 03:12:03,153
did a public appearance together
on a television show in the San Francisco area

3358
03:12:03,211 --> 03:12:05,282
and it was about mmether

3359
03:12:05,347 --> 03:12:07,349
this kind of movie is bad for children or not.

3360
03:12:07,415 --> 03:12:09,622
There were parents in the audience and then kids.

3361
03:12:09,684 --> 03:12:11,630
All the kids leapt to their feet and started going,

3362
03:12:11,686 --> 03:12:13,757
(chanting) "Freddy! Freddy!"

3363
03:12:13,822 --> 03:12:18,737
And I remember looking at the show host
and the parents and they were all like...

3364
03:12:18,793 --> 03:12:22,468
Robert is just like, "You're all my children
And it was like,

3365
03:12:22,531 --> 03:12:24,636
"We've taken over the asylum."

3366
03:12:24,699 --> 03:12:27,908
It is that empowerment of
embracing the symbol

3367
03:12:27,969 --> 03:12:30,677
of the evil thing in a way that you're in control of it.

3368
03:12:30,739 --> 03:12:32,446
What we're doing is good, you know,

3369
03:12:32,507 --> 03:12:34,817
because the kids, it was giving them
a sense of empowerment

3370
03:12:34,876 --> 03:12:36,514
in a way that I could never have guessed.

3371
03:12:36,578 --> 03:12:40,253
I remember that scene is so great
because I'm sitting there in the background, you know,

3372
03:12:40,315 --> 03:12:43,194
there's a million fans wanting his autograph
and then, you know,

3373
03:12:43,251 --> 03:12:48,462
I'm sitting there looking at my watch, like,
"Can we go yet?" which is the story of my life. (laughing)

3374
03:12:48,523 --> 03:12:50,298
When I got sent the first draft,

3375
03:12:50,358 --> 03:12:53,032
there were some scenes that aren't in it,
that were never shot.

3376
03:12:53,094 --> 03:12:55,870
Rather than Wes being in the house up on the hill,

3377
03:12:55,931 --> 03:12:58,138
he showed up in a van driven by, I think,

3378
03:12:58,199 --> 03:13:01,806
Michael Barryman from "The Hills Have Eyes"
and he had cut his own eyelids off

3379
03:13:01,870 --> 03:13:03,816
and he was trying to stay awake.

3380
03:13:03,872 --> 03:13:05,909
I was constantly on the run from Freddy.

3381
03:13:05,974 --> 03:13:08,682
The way to save my life was to write the script.

3382
03:13:08,743 --> 03:13:12,190
I remember reading it just going,
"Wow, that's really weird." (laughing)

3383
03:13:12,247 --> 03:13:15,524
Of course, I ended up going with,
"I'd rather be in the luxurious house

3384
03:13:15,584 --> 03:13:17,427
living like a king. (laughing)

3385
03:13:17,485 --> 03:13:19,965
And Wes comes off as this kind of creepy,

3386
03:13:20,021 --> 03:13:25,164
horror-meister in a way. And then wnen he shows
that the script is actually on his computer,

3387
03:13:25,226 --> 03:13:28,264
the exact words we've just spoken one minute earlier,

3388
03:13:28,330 --> 03:13:29,604
(whispering) "What kind of choice?"

3389
03:13:29,664 --> 03:13:33,510
"Whether or not you're willing to play Nancy one last time."

3390
03:13:33,568 --> 03:13:36,242
those are the moments that make that movie so terrific.

3391
03:13:36,304 --> 03:13:41,117
I remember liking very much the scene where

3392
03:13:41,176 --> 03:13:44,350
Heathers husband is coming home in the car.

3393
03:13:44,412 --> 03:13:48,224
When you think about a Wes Craven movie,
you think, "Well, how do I die?"

3394
03:13:48,283 --> 03:13:51,025
(singing) "That's me in the corner..."

3395
03:13:51,086 --> 03:13:54,158
Son of crooning R.E.M. "Losing My Religion,"

3396
03:13:54,222 --> 03:13:56,168
getting eviscerated.

3397
03:13:56,224 --> 03:13:58,465
It <i>was,</i> of course, very violent.

3398
03:13:58,526 --> 03:14:00,301
Freddy's claws coming up.

3399
03:14:00,362 --> 03:14:05,107
But, the fact that he was a husband and
he had a little child or something,

3400
03:14:05,166 --> 03:14:07,737
I felt very touched by that scene.

3401
03:14:07,802 --> 03:14:09,873
But the one thing that they did later
When lsawthe movie,

3402
03:14:09,938 --> 03:14:11,747
was they did this thing where they did

3403
03:14:11,806 --> 03:14:15,049
an insert of me scratching my balls.

3404
03:14:15,110 --> 03:14:18,648
We had a ball stand-in for him. (laughing)

3405
03:14:18,713 --> 03:14:23,184
I just want to say to you, Wes,
that is not how I would scratch my balls, 0k? It's not.

3406
03:14:23,251 --> 03:14:28,997
This is how I would scratch my balls.

3407
03:14:29,057 --> 03:14:31,560
And, of course, the scenes that followed were the

3408
03:14:31,626 --> 03:14:35,972
<i>'cemetery scenes and that was interesting, mo..</i>

3409
03:14:36,031 --> 03:14:38,637
Everybody comes to be a mourner.

3410
03:14:38,700 --> 03:14:41,840
If you look in the background,
everybody's somehow affiliated with

3411
03:14:41,903 --> 03:14:43,041
"Nightmare on Elm Street."

3412
03:14:43,104 --> 03:14:44,344
Tuesday Knight was there,

3413
03:14:44,406 --> 03:14:45,407
Jsu Garcia.

3414
03:14:45,473 --> 03:14:49,046
So it's just a great way to catch up
with people and see how they're all doing.

3415
03:14:49,110 --> 03:14:53,058
A warm family farewell,
now it's turned into something horrible.

3416
03:14:53,114 --> 03:14:55,151
And that's the nice thing about Wes:
he's not afraid to

3417
03:14:55,216 --> 03:14:57,628
create horror in broad daylight.

3418
03:14:57,686 --> 03:14:59,632
The park scene is,

3419
03:14:59,688 --> 03:15:02,328
for me personally, one of the most
moving scenes because the little boy

3420
03:15:02,390 --> 03:15:04,870
climbs the tower, tries to reach to God

3421
03:15:04,926 --> 03:15:06,132
and then falls and <i>says,</i>

3422
03:15:06,194 --> 03:15:08,071
"God wouldn't take me."

3423
03:15:08,129 --> 03:15:12,168
It's one of the more profound moments in humanity,
you know, when one's faith is contradicted by

3424
03:15:12,233 --> 03:15:13,507
the events that happen.

3425
03:15:13,568 --> 03:15:15,377
They ended up actually getting rid of the park.

3426
03:15:15,437 --> 03:15:18,680
We asked them - we have 10 acres out in the desert --

3427
03:15:18,740 --> 03:15:21,550
and we said, "What are you going to do with it?"
and they were going to haul it to the dump.

3428
03:15:21,609 --> 03:15:23,611
So we rented the ï¬‚at bed trucks.

3429
03:15:23,678 --> 03:15:27,148
And growing up I've had that park
in my backyard ever since the filming.

3430
03:15:27,215 --> 03:15:31,823
There's a lot of ways to bring childhood into
a horror movie that I realized

3431
03:15:31,886 --> 03:15:35,356
And one of the ways is to bring an old story

3432
03:15:35,423 --> 03:15:36,959
that we all are really familiar with.

3433
03:15:37,025 --> 03:15:39,733
"Hansel and Gretel" was interesting to me
because there's been

3434
03:15:39,794 --> 03:15:44,436
a lot written. It's very hard to find Grimm fairytales
in a children's bookstore anymore. (laughing)

3435
03:15:44,499 --> 03:15:49,346
That was one of the most horrifying child stories.
When you think about the witch fattening up

3436
03:15:49,404 --> 03:15:50,178
the little kid inside the cage,

3437
03:15:50,238 --> 03:15:52,184
it is absolutely horrifying.

3438
03:15:52,240 --> 03:15:53,981
So, that Wes picked that story was perfect.

3439
03:15:54,042 --> 03:15:59,788
In a sense, children need literature
to recognize the nightmares that children have.

3440
03:15:59,848 --> 03:16:02,351
And then you had all these toys in Dylan's

3441
03:16:02,417 --> 03:16:04,920
room that were his protectors.

3442
03:16:04,986 --> 03:16:10,527
Rex was my stuffed animal bodyguard
who would keep Freddy at bay

3443
03:16:10,592 --> 03:16:11,832
from the bottom of my bed.

3444
03:16:11,893 --> 03:16:14,806
Imaginary, although effective.

3445
03:16:14,863 --> 03:16:17,867
I was lucky enough to keep
some props fiom the film.

3446
03:16:17,932 --> 03:16:22,506
This is Rex. This one is the repaired one
with the claw slashes on it.

3447
03:16:22,570 --> 03:16:27,280
It's funny because I have the other copy
of Rex in my house to this day.

3448
03:16:27,342 --> 03:16:32,121
And it always kind of takes a tug at my heart because
it's this thing that protects you but also

3449
03:16:32,180 --> 03:16:34,126
gets slashed in the process

3450
03:16:34,182 --> 03:16:38,688
but can be repaired and that sort of
childhood innocence in the form of a little animal.

3451
03:16:38,753 --> 03:16:41,825
My character, she has <i>so</i> much pressure and <i>she's,</i> like,

3452
03:16:41,890 --> 03:16:45,269
really kind of not dealing with it that great.

3453
03:16:45,326 --> 03:16:50,002
You need a lot of other supporting characters
to lift up the spirit of the movie, to keep it moving.

3454
03:16:50,064 --> 03:16:51,737
And so you had Fran Bennett.

3455
03:16:51,800 --> 03:16:53,780
Fran Bennett was incredible, she was

3456
03:16:53,835 --> 03:16:59,615
definitely our favorite. We loved her performance
and would quote her lines constantly in editorial. (laughing)

3457
03:16:59,674 --> 03:17:00,948
"Miss Ian gen kamp!

3458
03:17:01,009 --> 03:17:02,147
Miss Ian gen ka mp!"

3459
03:17:02,210 --> 03:17:04,486
"The man fiom your film?"
Yeah, it was just great fun.

3460
03:17:04,546 --> 03:17:10,053
I asked Wes how my name got to be Dr. Heffner.

3461
03:17:10,118 --> 03:17:14,032
He named it after somebody in the
Motion Picture Association of America.

3462
03:17:14,088 --> 03:17:17,535
"You have let your child see your films, haven't you?"

3463
03:17:17,592 --> 03:17:24,942
it was almost me just saying the lines without
adding anything at all, until it came to the glove.

3464
03:17:24,999 --> 03:17:32,975
Each time that glove got on my hand, it was like
some electric something happened in my body.

3465
03:17:34,275 --> 03:17:35,879
"Cut this evil out of him."

3466
03:17:35,944 --> 03:17:39,050
That was like, "Whoa, man. This is strange."

3467
03:17:39,113 --> 03:17:40,649
My favorite scene in the film

3468
03:17:40,715 --> 03:17:41,955
was the death of the babysitter

3469
03:17:42,016 --> 03:17:44,724
in the hospital when she's dragged around the room.

3470
03:17:44,786 --> 03:17:47,733
We, again, had a rotating room.

3471
03:17:47,789 --> 03:17:49,166
I'd done something similar

3472
03:17:49,224 --> 03:17:50,567
with a 40-foot room

3473
03:17:50,625 --> 03:17:52,332
with Jeff Goldblum as "The Fly."

3474
03:17:52,393 --> 03:17:57,240
This time we decided to actually show

3475
03:17:57,298 --> 03:17:59,539
Freddy in some of the scenes

3476
03:17:59,601 --> 03:18:01,342
dragging her up the wall.

3477
03:18:01,402 --> 03:18:03,348
Wes said, "You have to scream.

3478
03:18:03,404 --> 03:18:06,044
It's a horror film, you have to scream." So when

3479
03:18:06,107 --> 03:18:09,145
I'm getting drug up the ceiling,

3480
03:18:09,210 --> 03:18:10,780
I had to do a lot of yelling

3481
03:18:10,845 --> 03:18:13,018
and it was scary.

3482
03:18:13,081 --> 03:18:16,255
That was a particularly hard scene to film.

3483
03:18:16,317 --> 03:18:20,424
When they were filming my shot,
there was nobody behind, but they would put a

3484
03:18:20,488 --> 03:18:23,833
cross of tape on it and say, "That's your babysitter

3485
03:18:23,892 --> 03:18:25,269
getting killed, you're terrified,

3486
03:18:25,326 --> 03:18:27,363
it's horrifying, you need to cry."

3487
03:18:27,428 --> 03:18:28,065
<i>(screaming)</i>

3488
03:18:29,430 --> 03:18:34,311
When we previewed the film, it was amazing
to watch the audience reaction to it and, you know,

3489
03:18:34,369 --> 03:18:36,645
just how Heathers finally

3490
03:18:36,704 --> 03:18:38,149
taking control of the situation,

3491
03:18:38,206 --> 03:18:41,119
but it's too late to save Julie

3492
03:18:41,175 --> 03:18:42,745
The fieeway scene was probably, by far,

3493
03:18:42,810 --> 03:18:44,448
the most ambitious thing in the film.

3494
03:18:44,512 --> 03:18:46,082
We were allowed to have a mile

3495
03:18:46,147 --> 03:18:49,356
of this freeway.
And we were out there night after night

3496
03:18:49,417 --> 03:18:51,090
after night doing all these

3497
03:18:51,152 --> 03:18:53,792
very elaborate, sort of choreographed scenes.

3498
03:18:53,855 --> 03:18:57,302
Where Freddy's all lined up at that center median.

3499
03:18:57,358 --> 03:19:01,238
We had a stuntman who owned a truck and we

3500
03:19:01,296 --> 03:19:02,969
kind of built the sequence around that.

3501
03:19:03,031 --> 03:19:07,741
We projected a picture of the truck on a screen

3502
03:19:07,802 --> 03:19:08,507
behind me.

3503
03:19:08,569 --> 03:19:12,483
Fifty or a hundred takes probably
to get the crouched down

3504
03:19:12,540 --> 03:19:14,281
at the exact moment.

3505
03:19:14,342 --> 03:19:16,822
We did that and then the next day
I couldn't walk.

3506
03:19:16,878 --> 03:19:18,323
In the film it almost looks like I'm

3507
03:19:18,379 --> 03:19:21,588
hit by these cars.
They had a big fake claw,

3508
03:19:21,649 --> 03:19:26,098
'cause there's a point mmere he picks me up
with it and that was really fun,

3509
03:19:26,154 --> 03:19:27,599
'cause they had a harness,

3510
03:19:27,655 --> 03:19:31,262
it drops and I think that was
my first stunt I had to do.

3511
03:19:31,326 --> 03:19:34,500
In the original script that I read there was
a scene with the claw mobile,

3512
03:19:34,562 --> 03:19:38,032
with Freddy behind the mmeel of a giant claw
that was kicking up sparks on the road.

3513
03:19:38,099 --> 03:19:40,079
It would have been awesome to see that,
you know, the claw mobile,

3514
03:19:40,134 --> 03:19:42,444
but there was no money to do such things.

3515
03:19:42,503 --> 03:19:45,313
And everything just gets completely
messed up from then on.

3516
03:19:45,373 --> 03:19:48,911
It's this strange, like other-worldly reality

3517
03:19:48,977 --> 03:19:51,253
that I enter, once I enter that house.

3518
03:19:51,312 --> 03:19:53,519
Dylan leaves for me the pills to follow him

3519
03:19:53,581 --> 03:19:55,993
into the netherworld.

3520
03:19:56,050 --> 03:19:57,961
The end sequence takes place in kind of hell.

3521
03:19:58,019 --> 03:20:00,625
Cynthia Charette had done "Shocker" with me and

3522
03:20:00,688 --> 03:20:04,602
she designed it based on Etruscan ruins,

3523
03:20:04,659 --> 03:20:07,936
kind of being taken dovm to the
essence of where evil would live.

3524
03:20:07,996 --> 03:20:12,741
We were working, you know,
in subterranean sets and boiler rooms

3525
03:20:12,800 --> 03:20:14,143
with live fire.

3526
03:20:14,202 --> 03:20:17,615
And I just rememberwalking around
and shooting tons of photos, you know,

3527
03:20:17,672 --> 03:20:19,345
of everything. I'm like, "This is cool."

3528
03:20:19,407 --> 03:20:21,580
And this wall, there's like a
Cerberus stone carving and

3529
03:20:21,642 --> 03:20:23,553
this big demon thing.

3530
03:20:23,611 --> 03:20:24,783
Weird paintings

3531
03:20:24,846 --> 03:20:26,416
and iron rod gates

3532
03:20:26,481 --> 03:20:29,621
and weird stuff like that,
the mmole way through.

3533
03:20:29,684 --> 03:20:32,130
I'd rather go there than
Chuck E. Cheese any day.

3534
03:20:32,186 --> 03:20:35,065
I think Heath er probably
deserved stunt pay

3535
03:20:35,123 --> 03:20:36,864
after all the times
she's worked with me.

3536
03:20:36,924 --> 03:20:40,371
There's got to be at least one stunt check
from New Line Cinema she didn't get.

3537
03:20:40,428 --> 03:20:42,908
We're really hand-to-hand combat.

3538
03:20:42,964 --> 03:20:48,038
I mean, it's really fighting and I stick him in the eye
with the eel and then I try to catch him on fire and

3539
03:20:48,102 --> 03:20:50,241
then I actually, you know, say,

3540
03:20:50,304 --> 03:20:51,977
"Fuck you!"

3541
03:20:52,040 --> 03:20:55,613
And I loved that, 'cause Nancyjust
never gets to say that. (laughing)

3542
03:20:55,676 --> 03:20:57,155
And then he yanks me

3543
03:20:57,211 --> 03:20:59,020
by the hair and he throws me up against the wall,

3544
03:20:59,080 --> 03:21:01,458
and if you'll notice, right next to my head it <i>says,</i>

3545
03:21:01,516 --> 03:21:01,926
"Lust."

3546
03:21:02,150 --> 03:21:07,566
At that point, you know, Nancy and Freddy's
relationship always had a sexual

3547
03:21:07,622 --> 03:21:10,034
componenLAm I gonna kiss her

3548
03:21:10,091 --> 03:21:11,661
or gut her?

3549
03:21:11,726 --> 03:21:13,865
You know? it had to be that fine line there.

3550
03:21:13,928 --> 03:21:18,604
To me, that is just the embodiment of
our battle through the whole, all the movies.

3551
03:21:18,666 --> 03:21:21,647
K.N.B. made a reallly long tongue

3552
03:21:21,702 --> 03:21:26,014
that, you know, wraps around my neck and my head.

3553
03:21:26,074 --> 03:21:29,283
It's actually, like, my least favorite thing
I've done for "A Nightmare on Elm Street."

3554
03:21:29,343 --> 03:21:35,419
<i>(screaming)</i>

3555
03:21:35,483 --> 03:21:39,431
We built a big, you know, foam latex
cable-operated tongue and

3556
03:21:39,487 --> 03:21:42,161
lubed it up. And, of course, that's always going to
bring about jokes

3557
03:21:42,223 --> 03:21:44,328
no matter what. You know, like, "Hey, ha ha ha."

3558
03:21:44,392 --> 03:21:48,272
When you're the only woman there
and men are wrapping, like,

3559
03:21:48,329 --> 03:21:53,278
a giant phallic symbol around your head,
(laughing) it really was awful.

3560
03:21:53,334 --> 03:21:57,874
I can remember telling, sort of lecturing the crew,
"Come on now, she's a human being and

3561
03:21:57,939 --> 03:22:00,112
don't have a laugh at her expense."

3562
03:22:01,442 --> 03:22:03,683
There's also a Wnole transformation thing,

3563
03:22:03,744 --> 03:22:07,624
<i>'which we got to do a 'make Freddy Kmeger change-o head..</i>

3564
03:22:07,682 --> 03:22:09,889
A bunch of crazy stuff in that film.

3565
03:22:09,951 --> 03:22:11,362
Well I remember Wes

3566
03:22:11,419 --> 03:22:14,127
unwanted to get a real reaction out of
Mike at one point.

3567
03:22:14,188 --> 03:22:18,398
And I said, "Wes, I can scare anybody.
I can scare the biggest grip on this set.

3568
03:22:18,459 --> 03:22:20,871
You want me to really tum it up?" And I did.

3569
03:22:20,928 --> 03:22:22,703
And I'm supposed to run up some stairs,

3570
03:22:22,763 --> 03:22:25,073
<i>run down some stairs, and he pops up..</i>

3571
03:22:25,133 --> 03:22:28,273
They didn't tell me he was
gonna be there to scare me.

3572
03:22:28,336 --> 03:22:31,283
Scared the bejesus out of Mike.

3573
03:22:31,339 --> 03:22:33,842
I didn't blame it all on Wes. I could have.

3574
03:22:33,908 --> 03:22:35,012
"Wes made me do it!"

3575
03:22:35,076 --> 03:22:37,647
I totally don't mind now, I get it.
I mean, it was probably good 'cause

3576
03:22:37,712 --> 03:22:38,918
they got a good reaction.

3577
03:22:38,980 --> 03:22:42,223
The nice thing about that movie is that
my character is really like

3578
03:22:42,283 --> 03:22:43,193
Gretel

3579
03:22:43,251 --> 03:22:44,787
and my son is Hansel.

3580
03:22:44,852 --> 03:22:47,025
We're both just trying to get back

3581
03:22:47,088 --> 03:22:51,764
to the normal life that we had before Freddy
started invading our dreams again.

3582
03:22:51,826 --> 03:22:53,203
And at the end we come back out of it

3583
03:22:53,261 --> 03:22:55,707
and go back to the normal wand.

3584
03:22:55,763 --> 03:22:59,472
This is something that's ageless.
That's kind of what I wanted to say,

3585
03:22:59,534 --> 03:23:02,105
is that this kind of movie, this kind of story

3586
03:23:02,170 --> 03:23:03,945
could be found in "The Odyssey,"
could be found

3587
03:23:04,005 --> 03:23:05,279
in Greek tragedies.

3588
03:23:05,339 --> 03:23:09,185
It's the type of story that's been
pan of humanity for millennia.

3589
03:23:09,243 --> 03:23:15,125
Hailed by the NewYorkTimes as,
"an ingenious, cathartic exercise in illusion and fear,"

3590
03:23:15,183 --> 03:23:22,101
Wes Craven's "N ew Nightmare" was released on
October 14, 1994 to glowing reviews but

3591
03:23:22,156 --> 03:23:27,799
disappointing box office. However, to many,
Wes Craven's final nod to Freddy

3592
03:23:27,862 --> 03:23:30,775
remains a high point in the franchise

3593
03:23:30,831 --> 03:23:35,974
To me, it's the end of the "Nightmare" series,
you know, despite what all other nonsense

3594
03:23:36,037 --> 03:23:37,175
they did after that.

3595
03:23:37,238 --> 03:23:38,945
<i>(laughing)</i>

3596
03:23:39,006 --> 03:23:43,421
But, to me, that really was the finale
and I think Wes wrapped it up quite well.

3597
03:23:43,477 --> 03:23:48,551
And, I think, without a doubt, it's my
favorite of the films now. I think it's so smart.

3598
03:23:48,616 --> 03:23:50,994
Every time I see it I find something new.

3599
03:23:51,052 --> 03:23:53,999
I love what we say about Hollywood and ourselves

3600
03:23:54,055 --> 03:23:57,730
When the movie opened I think it
opened opposite "Pulp Fiction," so

3601
03:23:57,792 --> 03:24:00,466
"Pulp Fiction" was obviously a tour de force.

3602
03:24:00,528 --> 03:24:04,806
Ithinkthe film kind of got lost a little bit in that,
but thanks to, you know, DVD and everything like that,

3603
03:24:04,865 --> 03:24:06,776
it still has a fan base.

3604
03:24:06,834 --> 03:24:10,179
That film was very much ahead of it's time.
I think that's one of the reasons why it's had

3605
03:24:10,238 --> 03:24:12,445
a pretty good afterlife and pretty good legs.

3606
03:24:12,506 --> 03:24:15,919
When we look back, it was actually a relatively
well-reviewed film at the time.

3607
03:24:15,977 --> 03:24:23,623
It was almost a little too unique and cerebral.
So, it wasn't so much scary, it was just clever.

3608
03:24:23,684 --> 03:24:25,288
It had a lot of story,

3609
03:24:25,353 --> 03:24:29,665
a lot of logic, a lot of reason.
And those things aren't necessarily important

3610
03:24:29,724 --> 03:24:33,001
to a Friday night crowd of teenagers.

3611
03:24:33,060 --> 03:24:35,904
I think it was the precursor to "Scream."

3612
03:24:35,963 --> 03:24:40,002
"New Nightmare" was made for the people
who made the film, kind of adults.

3613
03:24:40,067 --> 03:24:44,846
"Scream" was made for the audience that
watches the film and those were the central characters.

3614
03:24:44,905 --> 03:24:48,876
"Is that the one where the guy
had knives for fingers? Yeah, Freddy Krueger."

3615
03:24:48,943 --> 03:24:53,915
And you notice that Wes, a lot of the characters
take a swipe at 'Nightmare on Elm Street."

3616
03:24:53,981 --> 03:24:57,485
"It was scary. Well, the first one was but the rest sucked."

3617
03:24:57,551 --> 03:25:01,021
She did it with great relish, I noticed as well.

3618
03:25:01,088 --> 03:25:03,500
So many years later, it's like,

3619
03:25:03,557 --> 03:25:05,002
I'm just philosophical about it,

3620
03:25:05,059 --> 03:25:10,202
so I tapped into something. Half of it I was aware of and half-
maybe much more than half-- I wasn't aware of what I had.

3621
03:25:10,264 --> 03:25:15,441
And it's just like something you step back and say,
"Wow. I might've started that, but it took on

3622
03:25:15,503 --> 03:25:16,675
<i>a Me of its awn?'</i>

3623
03:25:29,417 --> 03:25:36,699
Fueled by fans' desire to see two titans of terror battle
to the death, "Freddy vs. Jason" was a film inspired by

3624
03:25:36,757 --> 03:25:40,864
the classic horror match-ups of the '30s and '40s.

3625
03:25:40,928 --> 03:25:45,673
"Freddy vs. Jason" has been incubating since the first
14-year-old boy came up to me after the first

3626
03:25:45,733 --> 03:25:50,773
"Nightmare on Elm Street" and <i>said,</i>
"Dude, you think you could kick Jason's ass?"

3627
03:25:50,838 --> 03:25:55,753
Each time I did another "Friday the 13th" movie
it was talked about.

3628
03:25:55,810 --> 03:25:57,915
Which is that male adolescent fantasy.

3629
03:25:57,978 --> 03:26:01,653
It goes back to "Frankenstein Meets the Wolf man."
This is nothing new.

3630
03:26:01,716 --> 03:26:06,597
And then when we finally got to "Jason Goes to Hell,"
of course, at the end

3631
03:26:06,654 --> 03:26:10,864
the hockey mask is on the ground and Freddy's
hand comes out of the ground and grabs the mask,

3632
03:26:10,925 --> 03:26:15,374
which, by the my, was my hand.
So, I technically did a shot as Freddy.

3633
03:26:15,429 --> 03:26:16,840
There was a problem with it because

3634
03:26:16,897 --> 03:26:18,342
we didn't have the rights to "Jason" -

3635
03:26:18,399 --> 03:26:21,312
that was Paramount. And it took a long time for

3636
03:26:21,369 --> 03:26:25,943
Paramount to finally lose their option.
They wanted to distribute the film and

3637
03:26:26,006 --> 03:26:28,384
so it was a combination of things.

3638
03:26:28,442 --> 03:26:30,217
I never really had any participation after

3639
03:26:30,277 --> 03:26:32,917
"New Nightmare" -- that was kind of
the end of it for me.

3640
03:26:33,180 --> 03:26:37,322
There was always this little bit of a conï¬‚ict
in terms of how to

3641
03:26:37,418 --> 03:26:41,662
conceive of "Freddy vs. Jason," of how to write
"Freddy vs. Jason," how to tell the story.

3642
03:26:41,722 --> 03:26:46,102
The problem <i>was,</i> even if you have these
two characters together and they're both box office bofio,

3643
03:26:46,160 --> 03:26:47,605
<i>Jason fives in this wand and than'</i>

3644
03:26:47,661 --> 03:26:49,163
Freddy is over in the dream world.

3645
03:26:49,230 --> 03:26:52,768
How do you get those two together
in a way that they can successfully fight each other.

3646
03:26:52,833 --> 03:26:58,215
I remember being at New Line during the gestation of
"Freddy vs. Jason" and it seemed to go on for years

3647
03:26:58,272 --> 03:26:59,979
because it did go on for years.

3648
03:27:00,040 --> 03:27:06,821
It is, arguably, the single longest developed
project in the history of Hollywood.

3649
03:27:06,881 --> 03:27:09,521
I just thought it was always one of those
legend projects, but I didn't realize that

3650
03:27:09,583 --> 03:27:11,153
so many people had actually been working on it.

3651
03:27:11,452 --> 03:27:14,160
I thinkthere were 13, 14, 15 writers on that script.

3652
03:27:14,221 --> 03:27:15,962
Something like 17 or 18 writers.

3653
03:27:16,023 --> 03:27:19,903
So many dreams, so many ways that Jason has killed people.

3654
03:27:19,960 --> 03:27:23,169
It was a real challenge to try
to kind of reinvigorate everything.

3655
03:27:23,230 --> 03:27:27,872
I believe I uvas playing off of a draft they had,
so some of the things in the draft I did were

3656
03:27:27,935 --> 03:27:32,042
original, but some were also in
whatever the previous draft was.

3657
03:27:32,106 --> 03:27:33,551
The only thing we were given,

3658
03:27:33,607 --> 03:27:39,182
was the notion of, that everybody across the board liked,
was the notion of the Freddy cult.

3659
03:27:39,246 --> 03:27:43,251
I created the head of a cult of Freddy fanatics
who were called Fred Heads.

3660
03:27:43,317 --> 03:27:50,235
And they all wore, like, the striped sweaters and everything.
And that cult was somehow instrumental in the plot

3661
03:27:50,291 --> 03:27:52,168
and trying to sort of resurrect Freddy.

3662
03:27:52,226 --> 03:27:56,197
Ron Moore, of now "Battlestar Galactica" fame, and I

3663
03:27:56,263 --> 03:27:57,799
came up with a take.

3664
03:27:57,865 --> 03:28:02,974
The O.J. Simpson trial was going on during the time
we wrote it and one of the drafts had this uvhole thing where

3665
03:28:03,037 --> 03:28:06,507
Jason actually gets caught and he's actually going to go on trial.

3666
03:28:06,574 --> 03:28:08,520
And the main character's the defense lawyer.

3667
03:28:08,576 --> 03:28:11,785
I mean there was a lot of weird-ass shit in those screenplays.

3668
03:28:11,846 --> 03:28:16,955
One of the highlights was when Freddy Krueger
actually pissed in the Holy Grail. (laughing)

3669
03:28:17,017 --> 03:28:20,123
I know that there was a boxing scene.
I know there was a hockey scene.

3670
03:28:20,187 --> 03:28:24,431
I know that Freddy got beamed as a satellite ray into the sun.

3671
03:28:24,492 --> 03:28:28,668
He had to collect thirteen dream demons
or something like that.

3672
03:28:28,729 --> 03:28:34,236
Freddy raped Jason's mother or Jason at one point. They had a
love baby, I don't kn ow. Some of th em got a little weird.

3673
03:28:34,301 --> 03:28:37,305
You got all these pieces sort of
built on top of each other Wnen,

3674
03:28:37,371 --> 03:28:40,818
at the end of the day, I think if you ask
most of the fans, I want to see Freddy

3675
03:28:40,875 --> 03:28:42,320
as I know and love him best,

3676
03:28:42,376 --> 03:28:44,219
Jason as I know him and love him best and just let these two

3677
03:28:44,278 --> 03:28:46,781
sort of forces of nature go head-to-head.

3678
03:28:46,847 --> 03:28:53,230
It's Ali vs. Tyson, it's the irresistible force vs. the immovable object,
and let them go. And ultimately, thankfully, it ended up in that place.

3679
03:28:53,420 --> 03:28:57,163
I think it was the fact that we didn't change their mythologies.

3680
03:28:57,224 --> 03:29:00,797
We came in saying, "There's a way to really screw this up."

3681
03:29:00,861 --> 03:29:03,603
and that's if you start changing who Freddy is,

3682
03:29:03,664 --> 03:29:05,769
who Jason is. If you start reinventing their backstory

3683
03:29:05,833 --> 03:29:07,835
fans are going to go nuts.

3684
03:29:07,902 --> 03:29:11,372
Those guys, ultimately, because they grew up as fans
of both these franchises, got it.

3685
03:29:11,438 --> 03:29:18,151
I think what we tried to do, and succeeded in some fronts and didn't
in others, was make them at least truly evil, scary characters again.

3686
03:29:18,212 --> 03:29:21,955
Things we always thought about were, what were the fans
going to think and what will Wes Craven think.

3687
03:29:22,016 --> 03:29:25,554
And, you know, we just tried to basically, God, not screw it up.

3688
03:29:25,619 --> 03:29:30,329
When it finally got together,
we had trouble finding a director, too.

3689
03:29:30,391 --> 03:29:32,667
They met with probably 40 directors.

3690
03:29:32,726 --> 03:29:35,798
They met with every director you could think of.
We went to one of the executives and said,

3691
03:29:35,863 --> 03:29:37,570
"You should really think about this guy Ronny Yu,"

3692
03:29:37,631 --> 03:29:39,076
because we were big fans of

3693
03:29:39,133 --> 03:29:40,407
"The Bride With White Hair."

3694
03:29:40,467 --> 03:29:44,916
We always were pushing for Ronny from day one. We really
liked Ronny. And then, at the beginning, I think he said no.

3695
03:29:45,039 --> 03:29:51,285
That first meeting my intention really was to go in
to tell Bob that I don't want to do the movie.

3696
03:29:51,378 --> 03:29:56,327
We had a lot of meetings with Ronny.
I remember a meeting at least 5 hours long where

3697
03:29:56,383 --> 03:29:58,294
Damian and I were literally acting out the script.

3698
03:29:58,419 --> 03:30:03,334
I told him straight away that I'm not a fan of both fianchises,

3699
03:30:03,390 --> 03:30:08,305
but he said to me, "That's great,"
because he wants somebody to come in with a different angle.

3700
03:30:08,362 --> 03:30:10,603
At this point we were looking forjourneymen.

3701
03:30:10,664 --> 03:30:13,201
I like the guy's cultural inï¬‚uences,

3702
03:30:13,267 --> 03:30:15,042
he's also a nice guythat

3703
03:30:15,102 --> 03:30:17,412
I felt like I could get along with, and he got hired.

3704
03:30:17,471 --> 03:30:21,613
There was an assistant, a gentleman by the name of

3705
03:30:21,675 --> 03:30:25,521
Jeff Katz and I think he's been a great help to me.

3706
03:30:25,579 --> 03:30:31,086
When I dropped out of college to intem at New Line,
my real goal <i>was,</i> I need to get on "Freddy vs. Jason"

3707
03:30:31,151 --> 03:30:35,327
before it comes out, because that's like my dream movie
to go make. I grew up on these things.

3708
03:30:35,389 --> 03:30:38,927
And when I started writing Bob Shaye as a little kid,
it was built around the idea

3709
03:30:38,993 --> 03:30:41,132
that some day I'm going to come out and make
a "Nightmare on Elm Street" movie.

3710
03:30:41,195 --> 03:30:43,436
He is the hardcore audience,

3711
03:30:43,497 --> 03:30:48,412
you know, of "Freddy" and "Jason" and he told me everything.

3712
03:30:48,469 --> 03:30:51,006
I was lucky enough to be a 24-year-old kid living the dream.

3713
03:30:51,071 --> 03:30:56,521
And to have your first movie you work on be your childhood
dream movie is a pretty cool and surreal experience.

3714
03:30:56,577 --> 03:31:04,997
I was very involved once they started developing the idea.
I was in contact with people at New Line.

3715
03:31:05,052 --> 03:31:07,692
They were saying, you know, "We're finally going to do this."

3716
03:31:07,755 --> 03:31:10,065
We always assumed that it would be Kane.

3717
03:31:10,124 --> 03:31:14,994
I always envisioned him as a Jason
that could beat the shit out of Freddy.

3718
03:31:14,995 --> 03:31:22,743
And then they hired a director and then all of a sudden I started
getting the feeling that something was changing.

3719
03:31:22,803 --> 03:31:29,482
Immediately we had some casting issues
because before I'm on board

3720
03:31:29,543 --> 03:31:33,992
already the studio decided that they want a new Jason

3721
03:31:34,048 --> 03:31:36,551
And I was never given any kind of reason.

3722
03:31:36,617 --> 03:31:41,532
I mean, I know the thinking there. I think, physically,
they were looking for somebody that was taller.

3723
03:31:41,588 --> 03:31:43,693
Could Kane probably have done it? Sure.

3724
03:31:43,757 --> 03:31:48,035
But I also do think that you were dealing with the idea that
from a directorial point of view,

3725
03:31:48,095 --> 03:31:49,733
they were very clear, they wanted the idea of

3726
03:31:49,797 --> 03:31:51,834
one guy big and burly, one guy small and lanky.

3727
03:31:51,899 --> 03:31:54,880
I think, that to me, really was the largest piece to that decision.

3728
03:31:54,935 --> 03:31:59,441
I said, "Fine," you know, "this is their call and I'm fine with it."

3729
03:31:59,506 --> 03:32:01,213
It was nice to hear that a lot of fans

3730
03:32:01,275 --> 03:32:04,188
were not happy withe idea either, but

3731
03:32:04,244 --> 03:32:08,784
it was going to be a success to matter mmat,
just because people wanted to see the

3732
03:32:08,849 --> 03:32:10,328
two characters together.

3733
03:32:10,384 --> 03:32:18,599
The biggest question <i>was,</i> who would win the high stakes
match-up: a maniacal dream stalker or a brutal force of nature?

3734
03:32:18,659 --> 03:32:20,935
When I was making "Bride of Chucky,"

3735
03:32:20,994 --> 03:32:23,440
I learned, "Don't take this too seriously," you know,

3736
03:32:23,497 --> 03:32:30,847
have fun with the monster. So, I used the same
sort of principle to apply on "Freddy vs Jason."

3737
03:32:30,904 --> 03:32:35,410
Just that little outsideness that Ronny Yu brought to it,

3738
03:32:35,476 --> 03:32:37,114
being a Hung Kong director,

3739
03:32:37,177 --> 03:32:39,817
really helped it, I think. It's got a terrific cast, you know,

3740
03:32:39,880 --> 03:32:41,587
Jason Ritter, Monica Keena,

3741
03:32:41,648 --> 03:32:42,854
Kelly Remand,

3742
03:32:42,916 --> 03:32:44,122
Katharine Isabelle

3743
03:32:44,184 --> 03:32:47,597
from all of the "Ginger Snap" films. So, a terrific little cast.

3744
03:32:47,654 --> 03:32:54,071
"Lori, 17, pulls a stuffed toy, like a Furby but creepier,
away from her friend Kia.

3745
03:32:54,128 --> 03:32:56,904
Lori is an attractive, trusting gin next door."

3746
03:32:56,964 --> 03:33:03,609
When I was 8 years old I lived in Brooklyn
and I went dovm the street to my best friend LeeAnn's house

3747
03:33:03,670 --> 03:33:06,947
and they were watching "Nightmare on Elm Street,"
and I thought,

3748
03:33:07,107 --> 03:33:13,183
"This is just too terrifying." I had never seen anything like that
before, I'd never been allowed to watch horror movies before.

3749
03:33:13,247 --> 03:33:18,247
I was so traumatized by this movie that I couldn't,
literally, couldn't sleep forweeks

3750
03:33:18,886 --> 03:33:22,834
and it changed my physical appearance. At the age of 8,

3751
03:33:22,890 --> 03:33:28,306
I lost like 10 pounds. My teachers got so concerned that
they called my mother and said,

3752
03:33:28,362 --> 03:33:31,366
"ls there something going on? Is she being abused at home?"

3753
03:33:31,431 --> 03:33:35,004
And my mother found a picture of Robert Englund the actor,

3754
03:33:35,068 --> 03:33:37,981
and Robert Englund in the Freddy Krueger makeup and

3755
03:33:38,038 --> 03:33:44,614
pasted them up near my bedside table.
And every night before I'd go to sleep, literally for like a year,

3756
03:33:44,678 --> 03:33:48,649
I would have to look at it and say,
"lt'sjust a movie, it's just a movie. He's not a real guy."

3757
03:33:48,715 --> 03:33:52,527
And I rememberthinking,
"I'm gonna grow up one day and I'm gonna be an actress

3758
03:33:52,586 --> 03:33:55,089
and I'm never gonna make movies that scare little kids."

3759
03:33:55,155 --> 03:33:57,396
Cut to, a couple years later.

3760
03:33:57,457 --> 03:34:01,599
I was always joking to her, I said,
"Your scream can break glasses."

3761
03:34:01,662 --> 03:34:02,800
<i>(screaming)</i>

3762
03:34:02,996 --> 03:34:11,245
When I was screaming and hysterical, I really feel that
came from a place that I've repressed for so long that

3763
03:34:11,305 --> 03:34:13,251
I was able to tap back into immediately.

3764
03:34:13,307 --> 03:34:16,049
She almost, like, lost her voice after the movie.

3765
03:34:16,109 --> 03:34:18,282
And I didn't tell Robert this story

3766
03:34:18,345 --> 03:34:22,384
until the last day ofï¬‚lming and he thought
that was just so hysterical.

3767
03:34:22,449 --> 03:34:24,793
I was reallly excited to work with Jason Ritter

3768
03:34:24,852 --> 03:34:28,823
and he was actually a late addition because, I don't know if
people know this, but

3769
03:34:28,889 --> 03:34:33,099
Brad Renfro was originally playing that part of Will.

3770
03:34:33,160 --> 03:34:36,505
I was a big fan, I thought he was a really good actor
and we were excited.

3771
03:34:36,563 --> 03:34:38,839
You know, rest in peace, Brad Renfro. Brad Renfro,

3772
03:34:38,966 --> 03:34:45,315
I think, <i>was,</i> like, one of the more promising
young actors that we'd seen in a while.

3773
03:34:45,372 --> 03:34:52,312
As I'm sure everybody knows, he had a lot of personal problems
and those problems became clear when he showed up to the set.

3774
03:34:52,379 --> 03:34:58,523
I actually had to screen test with him and they thought
our chemistry was so good together,

3775
03:34:58,585 --> 03:35:01,293
that really kind of part of the reason

3776
03:35:01,355 --> 03:35:03,767
I ended up being cast was because of Brad.

3777
03:35:03,824 --> 03:35:04,802
Suddenly I remember

3778
03:35:04,858 --> 03:35:08,169
John Ritter, who worked on "Bride of Chucky."

3779
03:35:08,228 --> 03:35:10,640
And I also then remembered that he has a son

3780
03:35:10,697 --> 03:35:12,643
that also is an actor.

3781
03:35:12,699 --> 03:35:14,406
I was thrilled with Jason Ritter,

3782
03:35:14,468 --> 03:35:18,416
he's one of my favorite people now. It was sad, it was sad

3783
03:35:18,472 --> 03:35:22,750
to have to lose one to get the other.
In my ideal wand, there would have been two V\ï¬‚lls.

3784
03:35:22,976 --> 03:35:31,361
You need to have one guy that the audience
should invest a little bit of their emotion.

3785
03:35:31,418 --> 03:35:32,829
Person ally, I thought

3786
03:35:32,886 --> 03:35:35,093
we should invest a little bit more on Jason.

3787
03:35:35,155 --> 03:35:38,364
For me, he's almost like a samurai that went nuts.

3788
03:35:38,425 --> 03:35:40,132
You know a samurai is so loyal

3789
03:35:40,193 --> 03:35:42,366
and Jason is so loyal to his mother.

3790
03:35:42,429 --> 03:35:44,875
We have Freddy here, really tormented him,

3791
03:35:44,932 --> 03:35:46,309
humiliated him.

3792
03:35:46,366 --> 03:35:48,346
I never asked anybody

3793
03:35:48,402 --> 03:35:49,642
to like Freddy,

3794
03:35:49,703 --> 03:35:51,649
certainly not to feel sympathetic for Freddy.

3795
03:35:51,705 --> 03:35:54,311
Freddy likes his work.

3796
03:35:54,374 --> 03:35:57,878
We always saw it as, you know,
Freddy was the psychological manipulator.

3797
03:35:57,945 --> 03:36:01,654
I don't think that Wes ever saw this as
a high body count type thing.

3798
03:36:01,715 --> 03:36:04,662
Freddy was more cerebral, plot-driven, manipulative.

3799
03:36:04,718 --> 03:36:07,756
For us, "Friday the 13th" was more fun, bloody,

3800
03:36:07,821 --> 03:36:08,856
high body count.

3801
03:36:08,922 --> 03:36:11,061
So, in that sense, we tried to stay true
to both characters.

3802
03:36:11,124 --> 03:36:16,073
Freddy sort of enlisted Jason to be
his little minion to help him kill people.

3803
03:36:16,129 --> 03:36:22,774
One of the funniest things I thought about in that movie
was that, you know, Freddy was about to kill people

3804
03:36:22,836 --> 03:36:25,407
and then Jason would kind of circumvent him,

3805
03:36:25,472 --> 03:36:27,509
you know, beat him to the punch.

3806
03:36:27,574 --> 03:36:29,850
"She's mine! Mine!"

3807
03:36:29,910 --> 03:36:32,789
And then it became a competition of them fighting

3808
03:36:32,846 --> 03:36:34,848
after the same prey.

3809
03:36:34,915 --> 03:36:40,024
<i>And so that's how they became adversaries,</i>
which <i>was kind of</i> cool.

3810
03:36:40,087 --> 03:36:44,263
I'm actually the only one that Freddy actually kills

3811
03:36:44,324 --> 03:36:45,769
in "Freddy vs. Jason."

3812
03:36:45,826 --> 03:36:48,432
So, I'm a very lucky, lucky, lucky man.

3813
03:36:48,495 --> 03:36:51,101
"Mark sits at his desk, going through drawers.

3814
03:36:51,164 --> 03:36:56,307
He pulls out a framed black-and-white photo of
him on the shoulders of his older brother Bobby."

3815
03:36:56,370 --> 03:37:03,515
The character I play in "Freddy vs. Jason Bobby,
ends up becoming a tormenter of Mark,

3816
03:37:03,577 --> 03:37:06,581
but he's actually his older brother. And,

3817
03:37:06,646 --> 03:37:09,252
even though I am Scut Farkus from
"A Christmas Story,"

3818
03:37:09,316 --> 03:37:11,956
and I'm kn own as a turd woï¬‚dwide around Christmas,

3819
03:37:12,019 --> 03:37:17,367
I don't think that was a motivating factor
for hiring me as Bobby because you had to have

3820
03:37:17,424 --> 03:37:19,301
a lot of sympathy and pathos for Bobby.

3821
03:37:19,359 --> 03:37:23,364
That was two of my favorite characters;
we loved that relationship.

3822
03:37:23,430 --> 03:37:31,110
There was this kind of unspoken history vi/nere
Mark's brother was, you know, killed at some point by Freddy.

3823
03:37:31,171 --> 03:37:32,980
And it really ramped up

3824
03:37:33,040 --> 03:37:35,850
the pain that Mark's character felt in losing his older brother

3825
03:37:35,909 --> 03:37:40,289
and gave him a lot more momentum and
impetus as to why he reacted the way he did.

3826
03:37:40,347 --> 03:37:42,349
And that did just get hacked to shit.

3827
03:37:42,482 --> 03:37:46,123
I'm walking through this elaborate bathroom set

3828
03:37:46,186 --> 03:37:47,995
and then committing suicide

3829
03:37:48,055 --> 03:37:51,901
was a full day and a half of shooting

3830
03:37:51,958 --> 03:37:55,462
wearing nothing but what we call in the industry, a "cock sock."

3831
03:37:55,529 --> 03:37:57,907
Shooting the bathroom scene, I had

3832
03:37:57,964 --> 03:37:59,910
the prosthetics coming out,

3833
03:37:59,966 --> 03:38:02,105
the blood tendrils coming out of my feet,

3834
03:38:02,169 --> 03:38:03,614
rooting me to the ï¬‚oor.

3835
03:38:03,670 --> 03:38:08,085
And so, those took like three or four hours to set.

3836
03:38:08,141 --> 03:38:11,748
And then we had the other sequence
where I'm walking towards Mark.

3837
03:38:11,812 --> 03:38:13,155
This prosthetic has got

3838
03:38:13,213 --> 03:38:17,457
all these little air bubbles in it
that expand and contract

3839
03:38:17,517 --> 03:38:19,292
and some of them are filled with smoke

3840
03:38:19,352 --> 03:38:22,424
and some of them are filled with blood,
some of them are filled with pus.

3841
03:38:22,489 --> 03:38:32,433
And right behind me, you've got five special effects guys
on their knees, smoking cigarettes, blowing the smoke

3842
03:38:32,499 --> 03:38:34,206
through the tube, pumping these things. (laughing)

3843
03:38:34,267 --> 03:38:37,942
And on their knees waddling as quietly as they can
and you're trying to be all

3844
03:38:38,004 --> 03:38:40,644
sexy and scary, you know, while you do this
monologue towards Brendan,

3845
03:38:40,707 --> 03:38:43,051
and you've got five people up your butt.

3846
03:38:43,110 --> 03:38:49,288
We shot more with Mark, that dream stuff, that I would
love to see actually go back in at some point on DVD,

3847
03:38:49,349 --> 03:38:52,057
that has a little more of Freddy screwing with him
and is a little more

3848
03:38:52,152 --> 03:38:54,598
sort of drawn out in the classic Freddy tradition.

3849
03:38:54,721 --> 03:39:02,139
It was really cool for me, you know, to be in scenes with Freddy
and have him be doing these very, like, classic things.

3850
03:39:02,195 --> 03:39:06,007
Like, he would be stalking me when I was
in the corner in the bathroom

3851
03:39:06,066 --> 03:39:09,878
and he'd be taking his claws out and, like,
dragging them dovm my face.

3852
03:39:09,936 --> 03:39:12,917
And, you know, I'm trying to act scared, but in my mind,

3853
03:39:12,973 --> 03:39:16,853
I'm like,"Oh my God, this is so classic." Like, "I can't believe

3854
03:39:16,910 --> 03:39:18,548
he's doing this.

3855
03:39:18,612 --> 03:39:20,023
He must really like me."

3856
03:39:20,080 --> 03:39:21,684
Originally, Brendan was gonna vomit all this stuff.

3857
03:39:21,748 --> 03:39:23,421
I can't even remember if it's in the final cut.

3858
03:39:23,483 --> 03:39:27,056
When you're working on a Freddy movie,
there's so much going on that you're like,

3859
03:39:27,120 --> 03:39:28,599
"Oh, really? We're setting me on fire now?

3860
03:39:28,655 --> 03:39:30,931
OK, sweet, nice, good. What's next?

3861
03:39:30,991 --> 03:39:36,134
Me getting my face slashed? Awesome. Let's do that."

3862
03:39:36,196 --> 03:39:39,200
Brendan Fletcher is a very, a really good actor.

3863
03:39:39,266 --> 03:39:44,340
He's got a fantastic range and a lot of passion
and integrity and a pleasure to work with.

3864
03:39:44,404 --> 03:39:48,978
Zack Ward is a liar. Absolute liar.

3865
03:39:49,042 --> 03:39:51,420
"Dude, that goalie was pissed about something."

3866
03:39:51,478 --> 03:39:53,185
The character of Freeburg, I think <i>was,</i>

3867
03:39:53,246 --> 03:39:56,352
I don't even know if you would say inspired by

3868
03:39:56,416 --> 03:39:58,123
the "Jay & Silent Bob" character.

3869
03:39:58,251 --> 03:40:00,891
I feel like it was sort of a direct rip off.

3870
03:40:00,954 --> 03:40:03,298
It almost takes you out of it because you're like,

3871
03:40:03,356 --> 03:40:07,566
"Wait, is that that guyfrom "Jay & Silent Bob"?
And what is he doing here?"

3872
03:40:07,627 --> 03:40:10,301
I mean it was amazing. When they offered this

3873
03:40:10,397 --> 03:40:12,104
and I went and I played Freeburg

3874
03:40:12,165 --> 03:40:14,202
and it <i>was,</i> like, a lifelong dream come

3875
03:40:14,267 --> 03:40:17,646
Wait, I didn't play Freeburg. I wasn't in that movie!

3876
03:40:17,704 --> 03:40:20,150
But it's never gonna be the way you picture it, you know.

3877
03:40:20,207 --> 03:40:21,584
Stuff gets rewritten and

3878
03:40:21,641 --> 03:40:23,643
they change things. I mean, you know, it's an organic thing.

3879
03:40:23,710 --> 03:40:29,217
I think most of my regrets about the cuts
are stuff that made the movie illogical.

3880
03:40:29,282 --> 03:40:31,319
As a writer, the stuff that drives you crazy, is like,

3881
03:40:31,384 --> 03:40:34,058
"Well that doesn't make sense anymore
because you cut this scene."

3882
03:40:34,120 --> 03:40:37,658
Or, you know, dialogue that just seems
ridiculous now 'cause it's out of context.

3883
03:40:37,724 --> 03:40:40,534
"Freddy died by fire. Jason by water.

3884
03:40:40,594 --> 03:40:41,834
How can we use that?"

3885
03:40:41,895 --> 03:40:43,067
My philosophy is

3886
03:40:43,129 --> 03:40:45,405
everything in the movie

3887
03:40:45,465 --> 03:40:48,105
should set up for the end fight.

3888
03:40:48,168 --> 03:40:52,310
I finally had dragged Freddy back into reality,

3889
03:40:52,372 --> 03:40:53,817
into Camp Crystal Lake

3890
03:40:53,873 --> 03:40:55,409
where Jason's there waiting.

3891
03:40:55,475 --> 03:40:56,886
And it was a grueler because,

3892
03:40:56,943 --> 03:40:58,479
instead of chasing Heather around in her underwear

3893
03:40:58,545 --> 03:41:01,048
or lovely Lisa Wilcox in her teddy,

3894
03:41:01,114 --> 03:41:04,061
instead I'm rassling with

3895
03:41:04,117 --> 03:41:06,393
a 6 foot 7 Canadian who's been in over a hundred movies

3896
03:41:06,453 --> 03:41:08,865
and is buff and hard and can drink me under the table.

3897
03:41:08,922 --> 03:41:12,233
It was a rough shoot. I did a lot of my stunts.

3898
03:41:12,292 --> 03:41:14,272
I think the final battle was a lot of fun.

3899
03:41:14,327 --> 03:41:16,000
So over the top,

3900
03:41:16,062 --> 03:41:19,805
the violence and everything, that the audience would laugh

3901
03:41:19,866 --> 03:41:21,470
at the violence, rather than

3902
03:41:21,534 --> 03:41:23,343
really affected by the violence.

3903
03:41:23,403 --> 03:41:26,282
I got such a kick out of that because I thought, like,

3904
03:41:26,339 --> 03:41:28,512
they finally deserve it and they're

3905
03:41:28,575 --> 03:41:30,521
the only two that can torture each other

3906
03:41:30,577 --> 03:41:33,057
the way they've been torturing everybody else.

3907
03:41:33,113 --> 03:41:35,024
Maybe the thing that I hate the most

3908
03:41:35,081 --> 03:41:37,584
is Kelly Rowland's monologue right before she dies.

3909
03:41:37,651 --> 03:41:39,255
We didn't write a word of it.

3910
03:41:39,319 --> 03:41:43,267
"What kind of faggot runs
around in a Christmas sweater?"

3911
03:41:43,323 --> 03:41:47,829
And when I saw it, I mean, it actually really bothered me
that she used that word.

3912
03:41:47,894 --> 03:41:49,396
I'm surprised they kept it in.

3913
03:41:49,462 --> 03:41:55,743
Interesting enough that nobody, not New Line,
not the studio, nobody sort of picked it out.

3914
03:41:55,802 --> 03:41:57,179
What our original idea was

3915
03:41:57,237 --> 03:41:58,910
she's talking to Jason and she basically says

3916
03:41:58,972 --> 03:42:01,509
the lines that Nancy said in the original "Nightmare."

3917
03:42:01,574 --> 03:42:04,316
"I take back every bit of energy I gave you."

3918
03:42:04,377 --> 03:42:07,085
She says, "I'm no longer afraid of you. I take back all my fear."

3919
03:42:07,147 --> 03:42:08,751
And Freddy's behind her and <i>says,</i> "Wrong one, bitch,"

3920
03:42:08,815 --> 03:42:12,353
and that's what kills her because she is
mistaking one mythology for the other.

3921
03:42:12,419 --> 03:42:15,332
But, um, the faggot line made it. (laughing)

3922
03:42:15,388 --> 03:42:20,667
I actually did do a lot of my own stunts to the point where
I uvas like, a little frightened, you know.

3923
03:42:20,727 --> 03:42:24,300
There's this one scene where I'm running
out of the burning building

3924
03:42:24,364 --> 03:42:27,470
and, like, the mmole dock is about to blow up.

3925
03:42:27,534 --> 03:42:31,311
It was only supposed to blow up about,
you know, 30 feet ï¬‚'om us

3926
03:42:31,371 --> 03:42:34,648
and it ended up blowing up, it like ricocheted.

3927
03:42:34,708 --> 03:42:36,881
And everything, all hell broke loose.

3928
03:42:36,943 --> 03:42:38,820
<i>(explosion)</i>

3929
03:42:38,878 --> 03:42:40,949
We were hauling ass to get out of there and then

3930
03:42:41,014 --> 03:42:42,891
we just dive right into the water

3931
03:42:42,949 --> 03:42:48,399
and I remember aften-vards you could tell,
from the look on the director's face and sort of all

3932
03:42:48,455 --> 03:42:53,598
the people in production's face, like,
that something went drastically wrong.

3933
03:42:53,660 --> 03:42:56,698
My shoes would get burned and I don't even notice.

3934
03:42:56,763 --> 03:42:58,868
Well they just sort of said, "Okay,
well we got that. Moving on.

3935
03:42:58,932 --> 03:43:01,776
That's destroyed. ls everyone okay?"

3936
03:43:01,835 --> 03:43:03,610
But it was a great sequence, you know,

3937
03:43:03,670 --> 03:43:05,809
at the end, you know. It's all worth it.

3938
03:43:05,872 --> 03:43:11,220
The most cathartic part about it
is that I get to cut Freddy's head off.

3939
03:43:11,277 --> 03:43:12,779
It was like, "Fuck you.

3940
03:43:12,846 --> 03:43:16,350
Why'd you have to play that guy to traumatize me
for all those years?"

3941
03:43:16,416 --> 03:43:19,488
That's my favorite moment I've ever had on film.

3942
03:43:19,552 --> 03:43:20,394
Even

3943
03:43:20,553 --> 03:43:23,534
They did a couple endings that usually ended up in hell

3944
03:43:23,590 --> 03:43:29,302
that was a very sort of classic third act sort of set piece location,
a lot of those eany drafts.

3945
03:43:29,362 --> 03:43:32,070
Freddy and Jason were coming at each other
and then just before

3946
03:43:32,132 --> 03:43:34,669
chains went into both of them and pulled them apart

3947
03:43:34,734 --> 03:43:36,270
and, I believe, Pinhead came out

3948
03:43:36,336 --> 03:43:38,441
and said, "N ow gentlemen,
what seems to be the problem?,"

3949
03:43:38,505 --> 03:43:43,181
mmich I thought was hilarious.
That didn't work for a variety of reasons,

3950
03:43:43,243 --> 03:43:45,780
not the least ofvmich was that New Line
did not ovm the character.

3951
03:43:45,845 --> 03:43:48,451
We have a title name, "Freddy vs Jason."

3952
03:43:48,515 --> 03:43:50,495
I always thought that the ending

3953
03:43:50,550 --> 03:43:53,224
should be on these two monsters.

3954
03:43:53,286 --> 03:43:55,892
It shouldn't be on any other people.

3955
03:43:55,955 --> 03:44:00,097
But somehow the studio thought differently,

3956
03:44:00,160 --> 03:44:02,868
and so we shot the ending with a love scene.

3957
03:44:02,929 --> 03:44:05,170
I'm about the be de-virginized.

3958
03:44:05,231 --> 03:44:07,734
VWI was having sex with Lori for the first time

3959
03:44:07,801 --> 03:44:09,747
and hand turns into a glove, which confuses me.

3960
03:44:09,803 --> 03:44:14,718
For me, it's a little bit sort of wimpy.

3961
03:44:14,774 --> 03:44:17,448
I thinkthey only showed it once and, I mean,

3962
03:44:17,510 --> 03:44:19,456
the audience hated it and I hated it, too.
It didn't really make any sense.

3963
03:44:19,512 --> 03:44:23,426
Bob came in and <i>says,</i>
"Okay, guys, we have a problem here because

3964
03:44:23,483 --> 03:44:26,794
the audience hated the ending. So what are we gonna do?"

3965
03:44:26,853 --> 03:44:29,857
And I hate to say, "I told you so, Bob," you know.

3966
03:44:29,923 --> 03:44:31,596
I immediately come up with

3967
03:44:31,658 --> 03:44:33,103
Jason coming out from the lake.

3968
03:44:33,159 --> 03:44:36,402
I remember "Apocalypse Now,"

3969
03:44:36,463 --> 03:44:40,309
Martin Sheen's head coming out from the water.
That is the inspiration, that's

3970
03:44:40,366 --> 03:44:42,403
how I got the idea.

3971
03:44:42,469 --> 03:44:46,884
And Bob <i>says,</i> "There'sjust one thing I want to add."
I say, "What?" "

3972
03:44:46,940 --> 03:44:49,216
"I want Freddyto wink

3973
03:44:49,275 --> 03:44:51,482
at the end." I said, "Great!"

3974
03:44:51,544 --> 03:44:58,792
Nearly two decades in the making, "Freddy vs. Jason"
finally arrived on August 13, 2003 and fans turned out in droves

3975
03:44:58,852 --> 03:45:06,998
making it the highest grossing entry in both the "Elm Street"
and "Friday the 13th" franchises. The film's success proved

3976
03:45:07,060 --> 03:45:13,978
that by themselves Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees were
forces to be reckoned with, but together they were unstoppable.

3977
03:45:14,033 --> 03:45:15,740
Before the release of the movie we had

3978
03:45:15,802 --> 03:45:18,715
<i>this,</i> like, press conference, you know,

3979
03:45:18,771 --> 03:45:23,914
in Las Vegas, you know, almost like a boxing match,
like a Rocky boxing match, you know.

3980
03:45:23,977 --> 03:45:25,513
"Mama's boy here

3981
03:45:25,578 --> 03:45:28,582
he's stupid and he ain't got no style!" (audience boos)

3982
03:45:28,648 --> 03:45:31,857
And then they both come out and then
they fight each other.

3983
03:45:31,918 --> 03:45:33,795
They smash the table

3984
03:45:33,853 --> 03:45:35,833
and smash the chair

3985
03:45:35,889 --> 03:45:37,334
and I'm stuck in the middle.

3986
03:45:37,390 --> 03:45:42,203
I'm scared. It scared the hell out of me. (laughing)

3987
03:45:42,262 --> 03:45:45,436
When the movie came out it was the
highest horror opening of all time.

3988
03:45:45,498 --> 03:45:47,842
I think it was the highest grossing of the bunch.

3989
03:45:47,901 --> 03:45:51,849
I think it opened to $25 million or
something the first weekend.

3990
03:45:51,905 --> 03:45:54,044
Like, it was huge.

3991
03:45:54,107 --> 03:45:59,648
That's really a fan-inspired film and
that's probably one reason it did $135 million worldwide.

3992
03:45:59,712 --> 03:46:04,684
This movie made a lot of money.
So, if you think about it, a lot of people

3993
03:46:04,751 --> 03:46:06,253
have seen my bum.

3994
03:46:06,319 --> 03:46:07,627
Like a lot.

3995
03:46:07,687 --> 03:46:12,830
That performance at the box office was really driven by
convening the non-fans, getting those guys back that

3996
03:46:12,892 --> 03:46:14,838
had not seen one of these movies in several years.

3997
03:46:14,894 --> 03:46:18,740
There's nothing that brought it up to the
level where you could feel,

3998
03:46:18,798 --> 03:46:20,903
this is about some important human issues, aside from

3999
03:46:20,967 --> 03:46:22,810
just two men smashing each other.

4000
03:46:22,869 --> 03:46:24,280
So, it didn't do it for me.

4001
03:46:24,337 --> 03:46:29,685
It's just a fun movie. It's kind of like a big comic book.

4002
03:46:29,742 --> 03:46:30,982
Personally,

4003
03:46:31,044 --> 03:46:33,650
I just felt that my instinct was right,

4004
03:46:33,713 --> 03:46:38,287
even though I don't have that much experience,
you know, with both franchises.

4005
03:46:38,351 --> 03:46:42,629
I'm so happy that the audience also endorsed that.

4006
03:46:42,689 --> 03:46:46,660
There were some interesting ideas at one time.
There was a, you know,

4007
03:46:46,726 --> 03:46:48,865
a "Freddy vs.Ash vs. Jason" that was talked about.

4008
03:46:48,928 --> 03:46:53,274
At that point we had all pretty much gone with the idea that
it would be fun to go and get a real hero to go against them

4009
03:46:53,333 --> 03:46:55,438
and not try to mix the mythology.

4010
03:46:55,501 --> 03:46:56,809
I think that Sam Raimi wanted

4011
03:46:56,869 --> 03:46:59,349
Bruce Campbell to win,
mmich I thought was a terrific idea.

4012
03:46:59,405 --> 03:47:01,908
Making the world safe from sequels, Ash.

4013
03:47:01,975 --> 03:47:05,286
But I think that would be even
harder than it was to pull off "Freddy vs Jason."

4014
03:47:05,345 --> 03:47:06,619
As you can see it, it wasn't that easy.

4015
03:47:06,679 --> 03:47:09,558
It was debated for a second,
but it was never a serious consideration.

4016
03:47:09,616 --> 03:47:12,825
We didn't find the right combination
of elements to make it work.

4017
03:47:12,885 --> 03:47:15,263
I think with me, it's about time for "Freddy Meets Viagra."

4018
03:47:15,321 --> 03:47:16,925
Who won,

4019
03:47:16,990 --> 03:47:18,560
Jason or Freddy?

4020
03:47:18,625 --> 03:47:21,231
It's fair to say it's a draw, ultimately.

4021
03:47:21,294 --> 03:47:22,796
They both sort of won.

4022
03:47:22,862 --> 03:47:26,332
I think the winners probably Jason Ritter because
he gets to do a love scene with Monica Keena at the end.

4023
03:47:26,399 --> 03:47:30,973
I think that if you were a fan of Jason you definitely thought he
won, and if you were a fan of Freddy, he won.

4024
03:47:31,037 --> 03:47:32,209
And that really, to me, is actually the perfect ending.

4025
03:47:32,271 --> 03:47:36,879
Freddy's winking at the end there, so,
you know, he's still clickin'.

4026
03:47:36,943 --> 03:47:43,155
Well, in my mind, not necessarily in
other people's minds, I think it's Freddy.

4027
03:47:43,216 --> 03:47:45,423
I think it's Freddy, Freddy, Freddy.

4028
03:48:03,569 --> 03:48:09,986
After forty years, the company that started from the trunk of its
founder's car, saw itself at the end of an era.

4029
03:48:10,043 --> 03:48:17,120
In 2008 Bob Shaye's mini-major empire was consolidated into
its parent company, Time Wamer.

4030
03:48:17,183 --> 03:48:19,459
<i>'Merging with Warner Bros, of course, gave them'</i>

4031
03:48:19,519 --> 03:48:24,867
almost unlimited resources in terms of financing,
but it also tied their hands in many ways and

4032
03:48:24,924 --> 03:48:32,138
already then New Line changed from this really
maverick, independent company that it had been.

4033
03:48:32,198 --> 03:48:34,508
By the time we were making "Nightmare 7," New Line

4034
03:48:34,567 --> 03:48:40,574
was already, you know they called it "mini-major," it had no
resemblance to an independent film studio whatsoever.

4035
03:48:40,640 --> 03:48:44,588
You could never make a film anymore there
for less than 20 or 30 million dollars.

4036
03:48:44,644 --> 03:48:47,682
You know, I'm like, "Don't you understand we made these films
for 5 dollars."

4037
03:48:47,747 --> 03:48:55,427
But all the son of small, more interesting stuff got lost
in a bunch of corporate people working within the company.

4038
03:48:55,488 --> 03:48:57,832
Bob could no longer say, "Screw it, this is what I'm doing."

4039
03:48:57,890 --> 03:49:02,600
The company was getting unwieldy and
the politics were getting unpleasant.

4040
03:49:02,662 --> 03:49:06,303
It was probably time to move on.

4041
03:49:06,365 --> 03:49:10,472
When Bob was then forced out of the company,

4042
03:49:10,536 --> 03:49:13,642
that was incredibly sad and incredibly shocking.

4043
03:49:13,706 --> 03:49:17,848
I still have sad feelings about the tum of events,

4044
03:49:17,910 --> 03:49:21,483
but I think, as somebody once said to me,
divorce can also be a good deed.

4045
03:49:21,547 --> 03:49:26,826
I was sad, but in a way it felt like, okay, this has been

4046
03:49:26,886 --> 03:49:28,092
a blessed run.

4047
03:49:28,154 --> 03:49:29,497
And they made some absolutely amazing,

4048
03:49:29,555 --> 03:49:32,092
obviously, some phenomenal films within that.

4049
03:49:32,158 --> 03:49:34,536
Afier the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy it was

4050
03:49:34,594 --> 03:49:40,840
kind of like an epiphany and it may have been
good to go outwith a bang.

4051
03:49:40,900 --> 03:49:46,407
And imagine that this guy created this company
from nothing and it became

4052
03:49:46,472 --> 03:49:50,887
a billion-dollar-making company winning Oscars.

4053
03:49:50,943 --> 03:49:57,622
That's the American Dream, and Bob Shaye and Sara Risher,
they have lived it.

4054
03:49:57,683 --> 03:50:01,790
It's, obviously, a sort of triumph of the underdog.

4055
03:50:01,854 --> 03:50:06,633
It changed our lives forever.
So, we owe a lot to Freddy Krueger.

4056
03:50:06,692 --> 03:50:13,371
Forged with passion, ingenuity and a maverick spirit,
New Line Cinema entered the annals of Hollywood history

4057
03:50:13,432 --> 03:50:16,777
as a pioneer in the world of independent filmmaking.

4058
03:50:16,836 --> 03:50:22,684
And those who were there tram the beginning
will never forget the house that Freddy built.

4059
03:50:22,742 --> 03:50:25,746
Bob Shaye launched some incredible careers.

4060
03:50:25,812 --> 03:50:28,418
There was something really special going on during that time.

4061
03:50:28,481 --> 03:50:31,394
New Line really was a filmmaker's studio,

4062
03:50:31,450 --> 03:50:33,623
because Bob always saw himself as a filmmaker.

4063
03:50:33,686 --> 03:50:36,360
Whether you worked in the mail room,
you were an unpaid intern,

4064
03:50:36,422 --> 03:50:38,834
wherever you came from, if you had a good idea, they'd use it.

4065
03:50:38,891 --> 03:50:41,701
One of the greatest times of my life,
those years that I spent there.

4066
03:50:41,761 --> 03:50:46,107
That's what drove us all, was just this excitement
to be working on a, you know, Hollywood film

4067
03:50:46,165 --> 03:50:50,477
and I get to be inventive, I get to be creative and
think of things that have never been done before.

4068
03:50:50,536 --> 03:50:56,384
I'm very fond of the "Nightmare" series and
I love looking back at them and I'm very proud of them.

4069
03:50:56,442 --> 03:51:02,324
There's actually so much more in this series than, I think,
even the people who make it sometimes are aware.

4070
03:51:02,381 --> 03:51:08,525
They're kind of hallmarks of the era and,
I think, the best ones. Take that, Jason.

4071
03:51:08,588 --> 03:51:11,000
I'm even going after Jason 'cause I don't care,

4072
03:51:11,057 --> 03:51:12,297
'cause I'm gangster.

4073
03:51:12,358 --> 03:51:16,738
It's become pan of, it's pan of my life. There's not a day that I
don't think of "Nightmare on Elm Street."

4074
03:51:16,796 --> 03:51:20,243
I was the boy in school that people threw rocks at, and then

4075
03:51:20,299 --> 03:51:23,644
I was the one that ended up on the silver screen.

4076
03:51:23,703 --> 03:51:25,376
So, you never know how it's gonna go.

4077
03:51:25,438 --> 03:51:30,547
What was once sort of, like,
"Yeah, I was in "Nightmare on Elm Street 3,"

4078
03:51:30,610 --> 03:51:34,148
has tumed into a definite sense of pride about it.

4079
03:51:34,213 --> 03:51:38,525
And I think that that's going to live on and on and on.

4080
03:51:38,584 --> 03:51:47,197
I have literally met executives,"I'm having a meeting. But I'm a Freddy
fan, you've got to sign this." I'm like, "Okay, this is off the chain."

4081
03:51:47,260 --> 03:51:52,471
it's still in my life. Look, it's been years and years
and no other movie I did is still in my life like this.

4082
03:51:52,531 --> 03:51:54,977
Still, now, I mean, even after all the other work I've done,

4083
03:51:55,034 --> 03:51:58,675
it's always, you know, Kristen from "Nightmare on Elm Street."

4084
03:51:58,738 --> 03:51:59,682
You were the guy.

4085
03:51:59,739 --> 03:52:01,878
Wow, I was so scared.

4086
03:52:01,941 --> 03:52:06,356
That, to me, is, "Wow, it really meant that much?"

4087
03:52:06,412 --> 03:52:14,957
It's incredible how these films have impacted people
who are fans of horror films.

4088
03:52:15,021 --> 03:52:18,093
Horror fans are really hardcore and they're loyal.

4089
03:52:18,157 --> 03:52:21,331
So, that for me is the greatest part of all of it.

4090
03:52:21,394 --> 03:52:24,807
They're just the most rabid, you know,
and they want to know everything.

4091
03:52:24,864 --> 03:52:28,334
And, I'm like, (whispering) "I don't know.
I didn't Write it, I just got killed in it."

4092
03:52:28,401 --> 03:52:31,143
lam very proud to be a part of something that became

4093
03:52:31,203 --> 03:52:34,582
such an iconic film of its era and

4094
03:52:34,640 --> 03:52:38,110
I'm very proud to have been a pan of Wes' vision.

4095
03:52:38,177 --> 03:52:42,523
I thinkthis film has its place firmly planted in film history.

4096
03:52:42,581 --> 03:52:45,289
I'm proud to be a part of what I think is

4097
03:52:45,351 --> 03:52:49,925
probably the best horror film series ever done.

4098
03:52:49,989 --> 03:52:53,562
I learned to believe in imagination in films.

4099
03:52:53,626 --> 03:52:57,369
I learned that there's a way to do it.
It's such a brilliant, elastic media.

4100
03:52:57,430 --> 03:53:03,005
Now I've done it and I began to love it,
you know, I became a fan now.

4101
03:53:03,069 --> 03:53:07,017
The best thing that ever happened to me
was "Nightmare on Elm Street."

4102
03:53:07,073 --> 03:53:11,453
It changed my life. It made my career
and pulled me out of poverty

4103
03:53:11,510 --> 03:53:16,459
and paved the way for a career that has
lasted now over twenty years.

4104
03:53:16,515 --> 03:53:22,591
If New Line is the house that Freddy built, my career is the
career that Freddy certainly launched and built at some level.

4105
03:53:22,655 --> 03:53:27,968
And so, what can I say?
I love that crispy, burnt motherfucker. I love him.

4106
03:53:28,027 --> 03:53:32,203
Freddy will always be Robert Englund to me and

4107
03:53:32,264 --> 03:53:33,971
he just created this persona.

4108
03:53:34,033 --> 03:53:37,503
I think if you got the wrong guy under that makeup
it wouldn't have worked at all.

4109
03:53:37,570 --> 03:53:39,880
Without Wes Craven and without Robert
I don't think it would have been,

4110
03:53:39,939 --> 03:53:45,412
obviously, it wouldn't even have existed, but I think it's just
a testament to their talent that that character became so big.

4111
03:53:45,478 --> 03:53:53,761
We only get so many great, classic stones. That's what
separates us fiom the animals, are the stories we tell.

4112
03:53:53,819 --> 03:53:56,925
And "ANightmare on Elm Street" by Wes Craven
is just a great goddamn story.

4113
03:53:56,989 --> 03:53:58,969
I can overemphasize

4114
03:53:59,025 --> 03:54:02,598
how important Wes Craven is in my life. I think back,

4115
03:54:02,661 --> 03:54:05,938
you know, he's given me this role of a lifetime.

4116
03:54:05,998 --> 03:54:11,914
If I never work again, I can kind of die happy
that I played a role that is so important in American cinema.

4117
03:54:11,971 --> 03:54:20,322
As Garrett Morris used to say, "Baseball has been berra, berra
good to me "Freddy's been very, very good to me and Wes taught me

4118
03:54:20,379 --> 03:54:23,986
to respect the genre and I'm glad I listened.

4119
03:54:24,050 --> 03:54:31,730
What I say to the fans is thank you.
And I say that to everybody Mo's participated

4120
03:54:31,791 --> 03:54:33,998
in making all the films.

4121
03:54:34,060 --> 03:54:37,041
There were better ones, there were not so good ones, but

4122
03:54:37,096 --> 03:54:39,736
they're all good in and of themselves and I know

4123
03:54:39,799 --> 03:54:43,645
everybody broke their back to do the best
that they possibly could.

4124
03:54:43,702 --> 03:54:46,308
And so, it was a fantastic experience.

4125
03:54:46,372 --> 03:54:53,551
We were able to do what I always like to do,
is to really entertain people.

4126
03:54:53,612 --> 03:55:01,622
When I die, it'll be, you know, in my obituary, I'll probably be
best kn own for inventing Freddy Krueger. (laughing)

4127
03:55:01,687 --> 03:55:04,566
it will be something like that that will
summarize my entire career.

4128
03:55:04,657 --> 03:55:08,605
And I think for Robert it will be, it's the man
who played Freddy Krueger.

4129
03:55:08,794 --> 03:55:15,302
You know, no matter what else you do in life, it's just one
of those things that a film has it's way with you. (laughing)

4130
03:55:17,837 --> 03:55:22,837
And now a reading from "Freddy vs. Jason,"
as the part of Bobby played by Zach Ward

4131
03:55:23,876 --> 03:55:26,152
And scene commences.

4132
03:55:26,612 --> 03:55:31,960
"Oh, that's right! Everyone forgot.
That's why they weren't afraid anymore."

4133
03:55:32,017 --> 03:55:37,558
"Let's kick this motherfuckers ass all over dreamland.
Hey Freddy! Where you at, you bumt faced pussy!"

4134
03:55:37,623 --> 03:55:41,196
"I guess I better go gnash my teeth for the paparazzi."

4135
03:55:41,260 --> 03:55:43,968
"Hello, baby!"

4136
03:55:44,029 --> 03:55:48,978
"How much longer will you go on blaming your dreams
for your own weaknesses?"

4137
03:55:49,034 --> 03:55:51,344
<i>Hesse! Jesse?'</i>

4138
03:55:51,403 --> 03:55:52,313
"Hello, dirtballs."

4139
03:55:52,638 --> 03:55:54,515
"You'll need a hallpass."

4140
03:55:54,573 --> 03:55:56,075
"Screw your pass!"

4141
03:55:56,342 --> 03:55:59,050
"Miss Langenkamp. Miss Langenkamp!"

4142
03:55:59,378 --> 03:56:04,885
"I am the wizard master! I am the wizard master!"

4143
03:56:04,950 --> 03:56:07,362
"Free me, you idiot, I'm your fucking memory!"

4144
03:56:07,586 --> 03:56:09,896
"Hey, up yours with a twirling lawn mower!"

4145
03:56:10,122 --> 03:56:14,935
"There's four letters in my name, Rod.
How can there be room on yourjoint for four letters?"

4146
03:56:14,994 --> 03:56:20,967
"Hey, yo, needle dick. I bet you're the only male in this school
suffering from penis envy."

4147
03:56:21,033 --> 03:56:23,377
"Faster than a bastard maniac!"

4148
03:56:23,435 --> 03:56:26,678
"'l'lme to die, scarf ace limp dick!"

4149
03:56:26,739 --> 03:56:30,186
<i>"It's super Freddy!" (laughing maniacally)</i>

4150
03:56:30,242 --> 03:56:36,158
"Come back to me, Jesse. I love you, come back to me!"

4151
03:56:36,215 --> 03:56:38,525
"I'm right here." "Oh." (screaming)

4152
03:56:38,817 --> 03:56:45,757
"Are you ready for it, boy? You been a waste since
the day I took you in. Now it's time to take your medicine."

4153
03:56:45,824 --> 03:56:49,465
"Thank you, sir. May I have another?"

4154
03:56:49,528 --> 03:56:54,102
"Jesse, it's okay, it's all over."

4155
03:56:54,166 --> 03:56:58,205
"Just step away from her, son,
just like your ass depended upon it."

4156
03:56:58,337 --> 03:57:01,716
"Oh great, now it's my dick that's killing me."

4157
03:57:01,874 --> 03:57:07,017
"You know, you're one major league hunk."

4158
03:57:07,079 --> 03:57:08,956
"Yes, I am one major league hunk."

4159
03:57:09,081 --> 03:57:10,185
"Hi, handsome."

4160
03:57:10,249 --> 03:57:10,283
<i>THU'</i>

4161
03:57:10,416 --> 03:57:11,827
"Andale."

4162
03:57:11,884 --> 03:57:16,094
"No, mother, you just murdered me.
Take that to your goddamn therapy."

4163
03:57:16,222 --> 03:57:18,668
"Somebody please wake me up!"

4164
03:57:18,824 --> 03:57:20,497
"Look for me in the tower."

4165
03:57:20,593 --> 03:57:23,096
"School's out, Krueger."

4166
03:57:23,162 --> 03:57:28,805
"Stay with me, Heather." (squirting sound) That's the blood
coming out of my eye. (laughing)

4167
03:57:28,867 --> 03:57:30,437
"What the fuck are you doing in my room, dude?"

4168
03:57:30,536 --> 03:57:33,312
"Welcome to my world, bitch!"

4169
03:57:33,472 --> 03:57:35,816
"Gin, you better put a lock on that window."

4170
03:57:35,941 --> 03:57:39,912
"In my dreams I'm beautiful and bad."

4171
03:57:40,045 --> 03:57:41,718
<i>"Rex!" (screaming)</i>

4172
03:57:41,847 --> 03:57:43,383
"The deadly dinosaur?"

4173
03:57:43,515 --> 03:57:48,328
"Goddamn it, Kristen, you ruin everything!
Every time I bring a man home, you spoil it!"

4174
03:57:48,387 --> 03:57:49,832
"The map says we're fucked!"

4175
03:57:49,955 --> 03:57:55,337
"It's a goddamn cherry bomb! Jesus, Jesse! What the fuck!"

4176
03:57:55,394 --> 03:57:59,467
"I have a feeling we've done this before."

4177
03:57:59,531 --> 03:58:05,880
"Cut the evil out of him."
"N000000000000oooooooooooooooooczï¬‚!!!!"

4178
03:58:11,176 --> 03:58:11,984
"Freddy's dead."

4179
03:58:12,111 --> 03:58:17,993
"When that time comes, you're going to have to make a choice
whether you're willing to play Nancy one last time."

4180
03:58:18,117 --> 03:58:24,329
"Whatever you do, don't fall asleep."
