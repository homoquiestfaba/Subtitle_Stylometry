so he is for your pruning

He grinds and he kneads you

And then he assigns
you to his sacred fire

That you may become sacred bread
for God's sacred feast

702

All these things shall love do unto you

the secrets of your heart

but not all of your tears

For love is enough

715
00:51:54,520 --> 00:52:00,260
You should say,
"I am in the heart of God"

716
00:52:00,360 --> 00:52:04,860
You cannot direct the course of Love

717
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:11,889
If Love, it finds you worthy,
directs your course

00:52:13,640 --> 00:52:18,340
To wake at dawn with a winged heart

719
00:52:18,440 --> 00:52:22,940
To come home in
the evening with gratitude

720
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:27,820
Then to sleep with a prayer
for the beloved in your heart

721
00:52:27,920 --> 00:52:33,540
And a song of praise on your lips

722
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:37,380
"And then to sleep with a prayer
for the beloved in your heart

723
00:52:37,480 --> 00:52:40,609
"And a song of praise upon your lips"

724
00:52:41,560 --> 00:52:42,561
Ah!

725
00:52:47,120 --> 00:52:49,088
Ah! Caught you. (LAUGHS)

726
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:51,540
- Yes.
- (GRUNTING)

727
00:52:51,640 --> 00:52:55,770
Excuse me, have you met my friend?
Her name is Almitra.

728
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,042
Your friend, you say. Oh.

729
00:52:59,440 --> 00:53:01,408
(STUTTERS) We have met, yes.

730
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,620
Oh, good, I'll feel better
knowing she has friends

731
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:12,768
to look after her when I'm gone.

732
00:53:14,160 --> 00:53:15,810
What is it, Yousef?

733
00:53:16,760 --> 00:53:18,340
It's just that, you see...

734
00:53:18,440 --> 00:53:22,700
Well, it can be hard to get to know
someone who refuses to speak.

735
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:25,167
I can see how that might be.

736
00:53:25,800 --> 00:53:26,961
On the other hand,

737
00:53:27,920 --> 00:53:32,642
sometimes people talk when they cease
to be at peace with their thoughts.

738
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,060
But there are those who have the truth

739
00:53:35,160 --> 00:53:38,801
within them, only they
tell it not in words.

740
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:44,924
In the heart of these,
the spirit dwells in rhythmic silence.

741
00:53:48,840 --> 00:53:49,841
(ALL SIGH)

742
00:54:03,960 --> 00:54:05,325
Oh. How did you...

743
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:12,380
And if I find that little ruffian,
I'll throw her in irons!

744
00:54:12,480 --> 00:54:15,211
Break time's over.
Come on, let's get a move on.

745
00:54:15,320 --> 00:54:16,900
- Shh.
- Oh. Don't leave now.

746
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:17,940
Mustafa, please.

747
00:54:18,040 --> 00:54:20,281
You just got here, for Pete's sake.

748
00:54:20,400 --> 00:54:21,460
Come on. Move it, move it.

749
00:54:21,560 --> 00:54:22,580
Please step away!

750
00:54:22,680 --> 00:54:24,580
Go on, go on, let's break this up!

751
00:54:24,680 --> 00:54:25,820
Enough of this.

752
00:54:25,920 --> 00:54:27,900
Get up. We haven't got all day.

753
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:31,060
Sorry, sir. You're right.
That ship won't wait forever.

754
00:54:31,160 --> 00:54:34,926
Mustafa, sir, food for your voyage
from all your friends here.

755
00:54:35,040 --> 00:54:39,220
Come on, Mustafa.
Time to leave all your admirers.

756
00:54:39,320 --> 00:54:41,846
Go with God. We will miss you.

757
00:54:43,600 --> 00:54:45,140
- Goodbye!
- WOMAN: Come back to us.

758
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:46,220
WOMAN 2: Goodbye! Take care of yourself.

759
00:54:46,320 --> 00:54:47,980
Stay here in the cafe, okay?

760
00:54:48,080 --> 00:54:50,321
You'll be safe until
I can find your mother.

761
00:54:50,440 --> 00:54:52,940
- Safe travels!
- Thank you, everybody! Thank you!

762
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:54,100
GIRL: Goodbye!

763
00:54:54,200 --> 00:54:55,201
MAN: Goodbye!

764
00:54:59,720 --> 00:55:03,380
There you are! I have
looked all over for you!

765
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:04,620
Huh? Kamila.

766
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:08,725
Oh, no, just tell me what I owe you,
and let's be done with it.

767
00:55:09,800 --> 00:55:12,380
My dear lady, no, no.
Everything is fine.

768
00:55:12,480 --> 00:55:14,687
You owe me nothing.

769
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:16,601
Okay.

770
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:18,605
Thank you.

771
00:55:20,400 --> 00:55:23,324
I have been out of my mind with worry.

772
00:55:23,720 --> 00:55:24,980
Mmm!

773
00:55:25,080 --> 00:55:26,980
Oh, no, you don't. Not this time.

774
00:55:27,080 --> 00:55:31,369
I've lost Mustafa today.
I am not losing you to a police cell!

775
00:55:31,480 --> 00:55:32,891
(SQUAWKING)

776
00:55:33,320 --> 00:55:35,220
What, what? What do you want?

777
00:55:35,320 --> 00:55:37,140
So help me, Almitra, don't test...

778
00:55:37,240 --> 00:55:38,605
(SCREECHES)

779
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:42,761
Mmm.

780
00:55:43,880 --> 00:55:45,450
What is it?

781
00:55:48,760 --> 00:55:52,526
Do you know what's going on?
Because I sure don't.

782
00:55:54,440 --> 00:55:56,044
(CHATTER)

783
00:55:56,320 --> 00:55:57,765
MAN: Goodbye, Mustafa!

784
00:55:58,600 --> 00:56:00,762
(SQUAWKING)

785
00:56:02,320 --> 00:56:03,380
MAN: Look, it's him.

786
00:56:03,480 --> 00:56:05,060
- There he is!
- Yay!

787
00:56:05,160 --> 00:56:06,491
Mustafa!

788
00:56:06,680 --> 00:56:08,125
(CHEERING)

789
00:56:11,320 --> 00:56:12,940
One minute, Mustafa.

790
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:17,540
There are some details
to be attended to at headquarters.

791
00:56:17,640 --> 00:56:19,529
Please. Come with me.

792
00:56:21,200 --> 00:56:23,180
I had no idea.

793
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:25,248
Of course not, Halim. (SIGHS)

794
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:28,004
Very well, Sergeant.

795
00:56:29,480 --> 00:56:31,740
- MAN: Hey, where are you taking him?
- GUARD: Please step away.

796
00:56:31,840 --> 00:56:33,380
What are you doing?
The ship is this way.

797
00:56:33,480 --> 00:56:34,740
Nothing to see here!

798
00:56:34,840 --> 00:56:36,060
Where is he going?

799
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,260
Let him go!

800
00:56:37,360 --> 00:56:39,060
WOMAN: What's going on?

801
00:56:39,160 --> 00:56:40,180
WOMAN 2: Ludicrous!

802
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:41,420
I can't believe this!

803
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:42,620
I thought he was free!

804
00:56:42,720 --> 00:56:44,340
MAN: No, he was free!

805
00:56:44,440 --> 00:56:46,169
Almitra, you knew?

806
00:56:47,560 --> 00:56:49,820
- MAN: Let him go!
- MAN 2: He's done nothing wrong!

807
00:56:49,920 --> 00:56:51,060
WOMAN: This is an outrage!

808
00:56:51,160 --> 00:56:52,180
GUARD: Out of our way.

809
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,611
No! Bring him back!

810
00:56:53,720 --> 00:56:55,460
- Please step away!
- Return to your homes!

811
00:56:55,560 --> 00:56:56,780
- Make way.
- He is an innocent man!

812
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,723
Almitra, no!

813
00:56:58,840 --> 00:56:59,841
Ahh!

814
00:57:00,320 --> 00:57:01,845
Almitra!

815
00:57:03,160 --> 00:57:04,220
More men over here!

816
00:57:04,320 --> 00:57:05,620
Move these people!

817
00:57:05,720 --> 00:57:07,404
Watch it! Careful!

818
00:57:08,160 --> 00:57:11,130
There! The girl! Get her!

819
00:57:13,560 --> 00:57:14,580
Leave her alone!

820
00:57:14,680 --> 00:57:15,727
WOMAN: You swine!

821
00:57:16,200 --> 00:57:17,340
(SHOUTING)

822
00:57:17,440 --> 00:57:18,441
(GRUNTING)

823
00:57:18,960 --> 00:57:20,166
HALIM: Almitra.

824
00:57:21,160 --> 00:57:22,571
- No!
- Wait!

825
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:24,806
GUARD: Clear the square!

826
00:57:24,920 --> 00:57:26,160
- Return to your homes!
- Ahh!

827
00:57:27,720 --> 00:57:30,724
Clear the area!
This is your last warning!

828
00:57:30,840 --> 00:57:32,420
Let me help you disappear
into the crowd.

829
00:57:32,520 --> 00:57:34,780
The people won't give you away. Quickly!

830
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:36,848
Thank you, Halim. But I won't put you...

831
00:57:36,960 --> 00:57:37,961
(GRUNTING)

832
00:57:38,280 --> 00:57:39,281
(GROANS)

833
00:57:40,200 --> 00:57:41,725
Ahhh!

834
00:57:44,560 --> 00:57:46,881
No, Sergeant. Let me help.

835
00:57:49,400 --> 00:57:53,540
People of Orphalese!
My friends, I beg you!

836
00:57:53,640 --> 00:57:55,802
Please! Be calm!

837
00:57:58,200 --> 00:57:59,300
But they're taking you!

838
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:00,460
They're liars!

839
00:58:00,560 --> 00:58:01,860
They're evil!

840
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:05,407
Let us not be too quick
to call others evil.

841
00:58:06,360 --> 00:58:13,005
"For what is evil but good tortured
By its own hunger and thirst?

842
00:58:17,800 --> 00:58:23,842
"Truly when good is hungry
It seeks food even in dark caves

843
00:58:26,280 --> 00:58:30,922
"And when it thirsts
It drinks even of dead waters

844
00:58:36,360 --> 00:58:39,860
"You are good
When you strive to give of yourself

845
00:58:39,960 --> 00:58:44,488
"Yet you are not evil
When you seek gain for yourself

846
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,260
"For when you strive for gain

847
00:58:47,360 --> 00:58:52,082
"You are but a root that clings to the earth
And sucks at her breast

848
00:58:53,840 --> 00:58:56,860
"Surely the fruit cannot say to the root

849
00:58:56,960 --> 00:59:01,940
"'Be like me, ripe and full
And ever giving of your abundance'

850
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:04,860
"For the fruit giving is a need

851
00:59:04,960 --> 00:59:07,804
"As receiving is a need for the root

852
00:59:26,040 --> 00:59:28,691
"You are good
When you are one with yourself

853
00:59:32,640 --> 00:59:37,806
"Yet when you are not one with yourself
You are not evil

"In your longing for your greater self

863
01:00:48,240 --> 01:00:53,700
"But in some of you, that longing
is a torrent rushing with might to the sea

"Carrying the secrets of the hillsides
And the songs of the forest

865

"While in others, it is a flat stream

01:01:06,680 --> 01:01:09,980
"That loses itself in angles and bends

"And lingers before it reaches the shore

01:01:22,800 --> 01:01:26,691
"In our longing for our greater selves
Lies our goodness

01:01:30,320 --> 01:01:33,688
"And that longing is in all of us"

870
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:08,765
So, Mustafa.

871
01:02:09,560 --> 01:02:14,020
Your first day of freedom,
and you bring a riot to our doorstep.

872
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:17,283
It was your men and their billy clubs
that brought on the riot.

873
01:02:17,600 --> 01:02:22,731
Order in the streets must be maintained.
Otherwise, anarchy.

874
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:25,180
I'm disappointed to see your presence

875
01:02:25,280 --> 01:02:28,740
is just as incendiary
as it was seven years ago.

876
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:32,740
Did your stay on the mountain
give you no time for reflection?

877
01:02:32,840 --> 01:02:34,300
Quite a bit, thanks.

878
01:02:34,400 --> 01:02:36,140
Then why do you persist with these

879
01:02:36,240 --> 01:02:38,900
treasonous acts and rebellious speeches?

880
01:02:39,000 --> 01:02:42,209
Treasonous?
I have only spoken with love.

881
01:02:42,520 --> 01:02:45,729
Oh. Only love and flowers, was it?

882
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:49,780
I believe this is yours.

883
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:53,420
"Pity the nation that
raises not its voice

884
01:02:53,520 --> 01:02:56,060
"Save when it walks in a funeral

885
01:02:56,160 --> 01:02:59,260
"Boasts not except among its ruins

886
01:02:59,360 --> 01:03:01,580
"And will not rebel until its neck

887
01:03:01,680 --> 01:03:04,365
"Is laid between
the sword and the block"

888
01:03:06,280 --> 01:03:08,100
"Love and flowers."

889
01:03:08,200 --> 01:03:11,060
Nothing less than a call to rebellion!

890
01:03:11,160 --> 01:03:12,300
I don't see it that way.

891
01:03:12,400 --> 01:03:14,721
Apparently, we disagree.

892
01:03:15,360 --> 01:03:18,364
It would, indeed, be tragic
