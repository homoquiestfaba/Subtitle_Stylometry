1
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:23,841
Know what I want to do?

2
00:01:23,917 --> 00:01:25,179
Yeah.

3
00:01:25,251 --> 00:01:27,219
What do I want to do?

4
00:01:27,287 --> 00:01:29,949
You want to fuck me.

5
00:01:30,023 --> 00:01:32,548
But you can't fuck me.

6
00:01:32,625 --> 00:01:34,024
Why not?

7
00:01:34,094 --> 00:01:36,494
You know why.

8
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,190
'Cause you're a virgin?

9
00:01:38,264 --> 00:01:40,198
'Cause I don't want no baby.

10
00:01:41,501 --> 00:01:44,527
You think I want a baby?

11
00:01:44,604 --> 00:01:48,199
With me, you don't have to worry
about that kind of shit.

12
00:01:48,274 --> 00:01:50,003
Why is that?

13
00:01:50,076 --> 00:01:52,203
'Cause I like you.

14
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:54,109
I think you're beautiful...

15
00:01:55,181 --> 00:01:57,809
And I think if we fucked,
you'd love it.

16
00:01:58,852 --> 00:02:00,547
You wouldn't believe it.

17
00:02:02,021 --> 00:02:03,784
I wouldn't believe it?

18
00:02:05,058 --> 00:02:08,516
I don't know, I just think
you would love it, that's all.

19
00:02:09,796 --> 00:02:13,163
I don't know. I'm scared
that things would change...

20
00:02:13,233 --> 00:02:14,723
between us.

21
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,702
What things?
Nothing's going to change.

22
00:02:20,573 --> 00:02:22,939
I just want to make
you happy, that's all.

23
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:38,320
You know
it won't hurt.

24
00:02:40,727 --> 00:02:42,786
I'll be gentle,
I promise.

25
00:02:45,131 --> 00:02:46,792
Do you care about me?

26
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:50,130
Of course I do.

27
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:50,086
(grunting and moaning)

28
00:03:52,665 --> 00:03:55,190
Boy: Virgins.
I love them.

29
00:03:55,268 --> 00:03:56,394
No diseases,

30
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:59,438
no loose-as-a-goose pussy,
no skank,

31
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:00,904
no nothing.

32
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:02,737
J ust pure pleasure.

33
00:04:05,812 --> 00:04:07,040
Girl: Wait...

34
00:04:08,748 --> 00:04:10,045
That hurts.

35
00:05:53,786 --> 00:05:55,879
- What's up, bitch?
- Shit, yo.

36
00:05:55,955 --> 00:05:57,354
- What happened?
- Guess.

37
00:05:57,423 --> 00:05:58,913
You fucked her?

38
00:05:58,991 --> 00:06:01,983
I knew you fucked her.
I sat here for like two hours.

39
00:06:02,061 --> 00:06:03,961
She was 12,
you hit that shit up.

40
00:06:04,030 --> 00:06:07,898
Well, who I am?
I'm the motherfucking virgin surgeon.

41
00:06:07,967 --> 00:06:09,434
How was that shit, yo?

42
00:06:09,502 --> 00:06:12,665
Oh, my God, so good.
That girl can fuck.

43
00:06:12,739 --> 00:06:14,604
Word, she can fuck, yo?

44
00:06:14,674 --> 00:06:17,404
Hells, yeah! Halfway through,
I'm thinking about...

45
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:20,935
"This girl's no virgin.
No virgin can fuck like this."

46
00:06:21,013 --> 00:06:22,708
You sure she's a virgin?

47
00:06:23,983 --> 00:06:26,042
Hell, yeah.
That bitch was bleeding, dude.

48
00:06:26,119 --> 00:06:27,882
When I first put it in,

49
00:06:27,954 --> 00:06:31,082
she all screamed all loud,
and then like...

50
00:06:31,157 --> 00:06:34,854
I think I saw her bite down
on her pillow, but I don't know.

51
00:06:34,927 --> 00:06:37,054
- How long did it take?
- Did what take?

52
00:06:37,130 --> 00:06:38,995
How long you fuck her for?

53
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:41,556
Well, you know,
it took me 15 minutes

54
00:06:41,634 --> 00:06:43,431
to talk her into it
and everything.

55
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:46,233
It took a little longer
than I expected.

56
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:49,604
But once it was on, we fucked
for a good half an hour.

57
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:52,508
I had to keep taking it out
and putting it back in.

58
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:56,276
It hurt the first time.
Didn't want to come too quick.

59
00:06:56,349 --> 00:06:57,976
Did her puss stink?

60
00:06:58,050 --> 00:06:59,108
Take a whiff.

61
00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:00,447
(inhaling)

62
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:02,317
Mmm...
Butterscotch, yo.

63
00:07:02,388 --> 00:07:03,685
That's the best.

64
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:07,092
That bitch
was so clean, dude.

65
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,092
Word?

66
00:07:08,161 --> 00:07:10,595
You could tell she took
care of herself.

67
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:11,823
How?

68
00:07:11,898 --> 00:07:13,695
'Cause she, like,
had all these like...

69
00:07:13,766 --> 00:07:16,564
powders and creams
in her bathroom.

70
00:07:16,636 --> 00:07:18,126
Let me smell
that shit again.

71
00:07:19,705 --> 00:07:22,265
I'm telling you, man,
that's why I love virgins.

72
00:07:22,341 --> 00:07:23,569
They're the best.

73
00:07:23,643 --> 00:07:25,133
Purity, man.

74
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,008
- You know what else?
- What?

75
00:07:27,079 --> 00:07:29,070
You can tell she just
entered puberty.

76
00:07:29,148 --> 00:07:30,080
How?

77
00:07:30,149 --> 00:07:33,346
'Cause I was flipping through
this picture book of her family.

78
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:36,946
And there was this picture
of her painting Easter eggs.

79
00:07:37,023 --> 00:07:40,481
And I was like, "Damn, you were
pretty cute when you were little."

80
00:07:42,862 --> 00:07:44,955
All right?
So, like, she was all like...

81
00:07:45,031 --> 00:07:47,431
"That picture was taken
less than a year ago.

82
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:49,229
I look younger
without makeup."

83
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:51,731
That's a good one.

84
00:07:53,306 --> 00:07:56,070
So I was like,
"Shit, this girl's a baby."

85
00:07:56,142 --> 00:07:57,803
Then I was like,
"Oh, shit...

86
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:01,574
that turns me on.
I want to fuck this baby girl."

87
00:08:01,647 --> 00:08:03,638
Fucking perverted bastard,
I swear.

88
00:08:03,716 --> 00:08:05,149
I'm tellin' you, Cas,

89
00:08:05,218 --> 00:08:06,685
I'm getting addicted
to this shit.

90
00:08:06,752 --> 00:08:08,276
To what, virgins?

91
00:08:08,354 --> 00:08:11,152
It's all I think about now.

92
00:08:11,224 --> 00:08:13,158
Having complex fantasies
and shit.

93
00:08:13,226 --> 00:08:16,093
- What do you mean?
- Like going all out.

94
00:08:16,162 --> 00:08:18,756
You mean, like fucking
two virgins at once?

95
00:08:18,831 --> 00:08:21,698
That would be kinda sweet,
but I mean like...

96
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:24,031
when I was fucking her,
right...

97
00:08:24,103 --> 00:08:27,539
I kept thinking how much
I wanted to put it in her ass.

98
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,939
She'd probably smash you
in the grille, kid.

99
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:32,944
I don't know about that.
She was pretty into it.

100
00:08:34,113 --> 00:08:35,603
What do you want to do?

101
00:08:35,681 --> 00:08:38,013
Get another 40.
Smoke a blunt or some shit.

102
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:40,348
- You hungry?
- I'm fucking starving, yo.

103
00:08:40,419 --> 00:08:42,887
Wait up a sec.
I'm taking a piss.

104
00:08:42,955 --> 00:08:44,752
Right up on this piece.

105
00:08:44,824 --> 00:08:46,951
Hey, let's go to Paul's house.

106
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:48,857
Paul, what for?
That guy's a dick.

107
00:08:48,928 --> 00:08:50,418
Yeah, but he always got food.

108
00:08:50,496 --> 00:08:52,726
He got them microwave
burrito things, you know?

109
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:54,493
Think he's got any herb
on him?

110
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:57,536
He quit dealing,
but I'm sure he'll smoke us out.

111
00:08:57,603 --> 00:09:00,163
- You think?
- Probably.

112
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:04,476
He lives on 76th, right?

113
00:09:04,544 --> 00:09:06,205
78th.

114
00:09:07,380 --> 00:09:08,938
Let's be ghosts, man.

115
00:09:10,449 --> 00:09:12,679
Hey, Telly,
she suck your dick, man?

116
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,812
A little bit,
but I really didn't want her to.

117
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,287
Why not, man?

118
00:09:17,356 --> 00:09:20,018
Having a virgin suck your dick,
that's so basic, man.

119
00:09:20,092 --> 00:09:22,026
It's simple. It's easy.

120
00:09:22,094 --> 00:09:24,585
But like, if you deflower a girl,
man...

121
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:25,790
You're the man!

122
00:09:25,865 --> 00:09:27,890
No one can ever
do that again.

123
00:09:27,967 --> 00:09:29,867
You're the only one.

124
00:09:29,936 --> 00:09:32,268
No one has the power
to do that again.

125
00:09:32,338 --> 00:09:32,827
Right.

126
00:09:32,905 --> 00:09:36,705
The way I see it,
my outlook on the situation...

127
00:09:36,776 --> 00:09:37,765
Mr. Wizard.

128
00:09:37,843 --> 00:09:39,743
It's like getting fame,
you know?

129
00:09:39,812 --> 00:09:41,939
Say you was to die
tomorrow, right?

130
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:43,709
50 years from now,

131
00:09:43,783 --> 00:09:46,274
all the virgins you ever fucked
will remember you.

132
00:09:46,352 --> 00:09:48,411
They'll tell their grandkids
about that shit.

133
00:09:48,487 --> 00:09:50,853
"That Telly, he sure
was good in the sack."

134
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,288
You thirsty?

135
00:09:53,359 --> 00:09:55,623
Hells, yeah.
I'm fucking dehydrated.

136
00:09:55,695 --> 00:09:56,684
You got any money?

137
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,821
Three pennies
and a ball of lint, kid.

138
00:09:58,898 --> 00:10:00,422
You down with the boost?

139
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:01,431
True.

140
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:03,627
Chill a second.

141
00:10:21,854 --> 00:10:23,287
You happen to have diss digg?

142
00:10:23,356 --> 00:10:24,550
What?

143
00:10:24,624 --> 00:10:27,149
Diss digg.
I'm curious, do you have it?

144
00:10:27,226 --> 00:10:28,693
What is "diss digg"?

145
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:30,490
Diss digg.

146
00:10:30,563 --> 00:10:31,552
What are you saying?

147
00:10:31,631 --> 00:10:33,792
Diss digg here.
Do you have it?

148
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:34,833
What?

149
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:37,892
Diss digg.
Diss digg.

150
00:10:37,970 --> 00:10:40,939
I don't...
I don't understand you.

151
00:10:41,007 --> 00:10:43,498
A'ight, one last time.
Do you have diss digg?

152
00:10:43,576 --> 00:10:45,134
What you say, diss digg?

153
00:10:45,211 --> 00:10:46,803
He said, "this dick,"
motherfucker.

154
00:10:46,879 --> 00:10:49,074
Don't you understand English?

155
00:10:58,724 --> 00:11:01,352
Stupid fuck boys.
Fuck you.

156
00:11:15,808 --> 00:11:17,139
(belches)

157
00:11:18,978 --> 00:11:20,411
What's up?

158
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,470
- It's Telly.
- You like peaches?

159
00:11:22,548 --> 00:11:25,881
It's Telly, man. Open up.

160
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,426
Yo, yo!

161
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,003
What's up?
What's going on?

162
00:11:50,076 --> 00:11:51,873
What's up?

163
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:04,947
Shit.

164
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:07,951
What's all this shit, man?

165
00:12:08,027 --> 00:12:10,621
Fuckin' up our crib.

166
00:12:10,696 --> 00:12:11,560
Fuck the crib.

167
00:12:11,630 --> 00:12:14,224
Move the fuck over,
you bitch ass.

168
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:15,692
What's going on?

169
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:18,896
Nothin'. Chillin'.
What y'all up to?

170
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:20,268
You want a whip-it?

171
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:23,137
Give me one of them shits.

172
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:26,269
This balloon almost busted,
so be careful.

173
00:12:29,048 --> 00:12:30,743
This video is phat.

174
00:12:32,651 --> 00:12:34,619
Listen for that crack.

175
00:12:37,022 --> 00:12:38,717
Pop that shit.

176
00:12:41,861 --> 00:12:43,294
I told you, be careful.

177
00:12:49,368 --> 00:12:50,801
How you doin' there?

178
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:58,007
You're going to be a vegetable
when you're older.

179
00:12:58,077 --> 00:12:59,874
Fuck off.

180
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:02,539
- My God. Look at his lip.
- Check it out, nigga.

181
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:04,640
Shut the fuck up, bitch!

182
00:13:05,918 --> 00:13:07,943
Your lips are blue.

183
00:13:08,020 --> 00:13:10,454
Shut up!
You don't even know me, nigga.

184
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,452
Look at this kid, yo.
He's like a fiend.

185
00:13:17,530 --> 00:13:19,623
That's why I like this shit.

186
00:13:19,698 --> 00:13:21,563
They wake my brain up.

187
00:13:22,635 --> 00:13:24,159
There's more, man.

188
00:13:24,236 --> 00:13:27,433
- How many people live here?
- Too many.

189
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:30,407
No, only eight or nine.

190
00:13:30,476 --> 00:13:33,309
Where does everyone sleep?
You homosexuals?

191
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:37,081
No, get the fuck out of here.

192
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,208
Everywhere.
It's a flophouse, man.

193
00:13:39,285 --> 00:13:40,946
We're still short on the rent.

194
00:13:41,020 --> 00:13:43,955
If we had a faggot,
he'd pay the rent.

195
00:13:44,023 --> 00:13:45,820
You and Casper can move in.

196
00:13:45,891 --> 00:13:47,756
You could share the bathtub.

197
00:13:47,827 --> 00:13:49,692
- I don't know about that.
- Yo, Telly...

198
00:13:49,762 --> 00:13:51,286
Jenny says, "What's up?"

199
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:52,694
Jenny who?

200
00:13:52,765 --> 00:13:54,255
You know, Jenny.

201
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,301
Casper: That pretty girl you boned
last summer.

202
00:13:56,368 --> 00:13:59,826
I haven't seen her in forever.
What's she up to?

203
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:03,866
I knew he wouldn't
speak to me. That dick.

204
00:14:03,943 --> 00:14:05,342
You still mad at him?

205
00:14:05,411 --> 00:14:07,208
Of course.
How can I forgive him?

206
00:14:07,279 --> 00:14:09,839
- What did he do?
- He stole her virginity.

207
00:14:09,915 --> 00:14:13,373
He took it away
and now it's gone forever.

208
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,750
It's not the fact
that he devirginized me,

209
00:14:15,821 --> 00:14:18,619
it's that he never
spoke to me again.

210
00:14:18,691 --> 00:14:21,558
He talked all this bullshit
and then just broke out.

211
00:14:21,627 --> 00:14:26,030
But he was all like, "Jenny,
I like you so much," and...

212
00:14:26,098 --> 00:14:28,760
"I promise,
I won't use you."

213
00:14:28,834 --> 00:14:29,960
Same lines.

214
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,559
He was talking mad shit.

215
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,468
The first time
is always whacked.

216
00:14:33,539 --> 00:14:37,270
Be glad you didn't lose your
virginity in the back seat of a car.

217
00:14:37,343 --> 00:14:40,335
- That's right.
- That's nothing.

218
00:14:40,412 --> 00:14:44,007
I had just turned 14.
With this asshole who was 18.

219
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:45,880
I can't remember his name.

220
00:14:45,951 --> 00:14:49,887
This was at sleep away camp
with your friends and shit.

221
00:14:49,955 --> 00:14:52,617
We were getting it on
in the bushes, around midnight.

222
00:14:52,691 --> 00:14:55,660
I got fucking mosquito bites
all over my ass.

223
00:14:55,728 --> 00:14:59,164
I thought nobody knew about it,
but everyone knew the next day.

224
00:14:59,231 --> 00:15:01,096
- And the pain was...
- Hell, yeah!

225
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,136
- The fucking pain! Jesus!
- That's the shit.

226
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:07,468
God, the pain!
The fucking pain! Jesus!

227
00:15:07,539 --> 00:15:09,473
You feel like
you're being ripped open.

228
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:12,408
You are being
ripped open inside.

229
00:15:12,478 --> 00:15:14,537
- Did you bleed?
- No, I didn't.

230
00:15:14,613 --> 00:15:18,276
- You didn't bleed?
- I bled all over.

231
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:20,284
On the condom, everywhere.

232
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:24,015
You know what he started singing?
"Sunday, Bloody Sunday."

233
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:26,080
- "Sunday, Bloody Sunday."
- That stupid fucking song.

234
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:27,955
I was like, "What the hell?"

235
00:15:28,027 --> 00:15:29,961
I couldn't believe
he did that to me.

236
00:15:30,029 --> 00:15:33,294
Then everyone at camp was singing
that the whole time.

237
00:15:33,365 --> 00:15:37,233
You know what?
I have sex and I like fucking.

238
00:15:37,303 --> 00:15:39,032
Hell, yeah.

239
00:15:39,104 --> 00:15:40,765
I love sex, girl.

240
00:15:40,839 --> 00:15:44,002
It's the best.
There's nothing better.

241
00:15:44,076 --> 00:15:46,306
It's the best thing, right?
That's it.

242
00:15:47,112 --> 00:15:48,704
No, no, not sex.

243
00:15:48,781 --> 00:15:51,614
Foreplay.
Foreplay.

244
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,082
Hardcore pound fucking.

245
00:15:56,155 --> 00:15:57,884
That's the shit right there, man.

246
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,084
That's the only way to do it.

247
00:16:00,159 --> 00:16:02,457
It's that boom, boom, boom.

248
00:16:04,330 --> 00:16:06,958
But there's a difference
between making love...

249
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:09,057
having sex and then fucking.

250
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,362
Right.

251
00:16:10,436 --> 00:16:11,767
Making love is like...

252
00:16:11,837 --> 00:16:13,964
It's, like, sweet.

253
00:16:14,039 --> 00:16:15,802
It's real slow.
Real slow.

254
00:16:15,874 --> 00:16:17,000
Sex is like,

255
00:16:17,076 --> 00:16:20,204
"All right,
let's have sex.

256
00:16:20,279 --> 00:16:22,474
Let's go, come on."

257
00:16:23,115 --> 00:16:25,481
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

258
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:26,677
That's the whole thing.

259
00:16:26,752 --> 00:16:29,482
They want you to be
so kind, so gentle,

260
00:16:29,555 --> 00:16:32,217
like you give a fuck
or something.

261
00:16:36,395 --> 00:16:37,953
- What's up, Jav?
- What's up?

262
00:16:38,030 --> 00:16:41,022
What are you doing
with a cigarette?

263
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:42,624
Like you care?

264
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:43,725
Yeah, right.

265
00:16:45,637 --> 00:16:49,334
Most of the time, you just want
to be all pounding that shit.

266
00:16:49,408 --> 00:16:51,740
I like that part.

267
00:16:51,810 --> 00:16:54,404
My God!
That motherfucker's the bomb.

268
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,175
If you could just be like,

269
00:16:56,248 --> 00:16:58,307
"Excuse me, miss,
can I borrow your hole?

270
00:16:58,384 --> 00:16:59,817
(laughing)

271
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:02,752
It'll only take a little bit.
I'll give it right back."

272
00:17:02,855 --> 00:17:04,982
- Right.
- "I'm done."

273
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,089
But that's it.
You got to take it slow.

274
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,221
You got to be smooth.
Girls like it slow and romantic.

275
00:17:12,297 --> 00:17:14,663
Fuck romance.
I like it hard and nasty.

276
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,293
I've been with a lot of girls,
so I know.

277
00:17:17,369 --> 00:17:19,200
Me too, nigga.
What's up?

278
00:17:20,639 --> 00:17:24,735
But it depends.
I was at Eric's house.

279
00:17:24,810 --> 00:17:26,141
Smash J was there.

280
00:17:26,211 --> 00:17:28,202
D.J. Flipper was there.

281
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,544
All right?
He was horny.

282
00:17:30,616 --> 00:17:33,949
He threw me on the bed.
We started getting it on.

283
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,886
They were in the room
getting dressed.

284
00:17:36,955 --> 00:17:40,220
They were going to a disco.
That shit was so good.

285
00:17:40,292 --> 00:17:42,556
He was fucking fingering me,
sucking on my tits.

286
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:44,960
I was like, "You go, boy."

287
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,691
We ripped each other's hair out.

288
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:49,734
We kissed so hard,
our lips were busted.

289
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:52,293
I was like,
"Work it, boy."

290
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:55,340
But y'all know why
I go out with Alex, right?

291
00:17:55,407 --> 00:17:59,537
He has the best fucking fingers
I ever had.

292
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:01,875
I'm going out with him.

293
00:18:01,980 --> 00:18:04,380
He got it going on.
That's that.

294
00:18:04,416 --> 00:18:06,884
That's why foreplay
is better than sex.

295
00:18:06,952 --> 00:18:09,216
They can touch you
and you're going crazy

296
00:18:09,288 --> 00:18:12,553
and all of a sudden, it's like,
"What the hell happened?"

297
00:18:12,624 --> 00:18:15,115
- J ust a big disappointment.
- It's a letdown.

298
00:18:15,194 --> 00:18:17,856
Then it takes them either
too long,

299
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:19,363
or too short to come.

300
00:18:19,431 --> 00:18:22,161
Have you ever had someone
who took forever?

301
00:18:22,234 --> 00:18:23,667
What, to come?

302
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,295
Let me tell you.
I was having sex with Jake,

303
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:29,135
and it took my man
an hour and a half.

304
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:31,142
I don't have
no hour and a half.

305
00:18:31,210 --> 00:18:33,337
No, no, no.

306
00:18:33,412 --> 00:18:36,313
You know what I notice,
though?

307
00:18:36,381 --> 00:18:38,611
Bitches love to suck dick.

308
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:42,085
It's like some secret
hobby for them or some shit.

309
00:18:42,154 --> 00:18:43,917
Some freaks.

310
00:18:43,989 --> 00:18:46,355
All bitches, man.
I know, man, I'm telling you.

311
00:18:46,425 --> 00:18:47,949
Casper's right.

312
00:18:48,026 --> 00:18:50,688
They act like they don't
in front of their friends,

313
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:52,161
to try to get respect.

314
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:55,632
When you get them alone,
it's the first thing they go for.

315
00:18:55,701 --> 00:18:59,296
The girls just grab your dick,
start sucking.

316
00:18:59,371 --> 00:19:01,737
They know they're
in charge of something.

317
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:03,398
Only time they feel prosperous.

318
00:19:03,442 --> 00:19:06,605
- I'm telling you.
- They love that shit.

319
00:19:06,678 --> 00:19:08,339
That's why girls
live longer than guys.

320
00:19:08,413 --> 00:19:10,881
Sperm's got vitamin C
in that shit.

321
00:19:10,949 --> 00:19:13,816
The shit's nutritious, right?

322
00:19:17,122 --> 00:19:19,090
Looking at your watch.

323
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,493
You know what's the worst?

324
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,394
Sucking dick.
I hate sucking dick.

325
00:19:25,464 --> 00:19:28,729
They'll be shooting you in the eye,
and the ear and shit.

326
00:19:28,800 --> 00:19:31,291
And you don't know
what to do.

327
00:19:32,237 --> 00:19:33,534
It hits that little thing...

328
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:36,540
the tonsils, the esophagus,
whatever the hell it is.

329
00:19:37,643 --> 00:19:40,806
- You don't get anything out of it.
- You'll be gagging.

330
00:19:40,879 --> 00:19:43,211
How much more can you bob?

331
00:19:43,282 --> 00:19:44,977
You don't get shit.

332
00:19:45,050 --> 00:19:47,143
Have you ever swallowed
it before?

333
00:19:47,219 --> 00:19:48,777
No.

334
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,845
Me neither.

335
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,652
- I have.
- Of course.

336
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,024
No, but it was like...

337
00:19:57,095 --> 00:20:00,531
No, it's like sweet and sour
and salty butter.

338
00:20:02,234 --> 00:20:04,065
It's like...
it's just nasty.

339
00:20:04,136 --> 00:20:06,263
You drink and drink
and you cannot get...

340
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:08,602
the taste out of your mouth.

341
00:20:08,674 --> 00:20:11,507
The sperm get stuck in your teeth.
They're disgusting.

342
00:20:11,577 --> 00:20:14,705
You gotta sit down and eat
a whole real meal.

343
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,771
All I know is that
condoms suck.

344
00:20:16,848 --> 00:20:18,145
They don't work.

345
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:21,414
They either slip off, or break,
or make your dick shrink.

346
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:22,851
(laughter)

347
00:20:22,921 --> 00:20:25,651
You got a small condom, huh?

348
00:20:25,724 --> 00:20:27,453
We still got to use them.

349
00:20:27,526 --> 00:20:29,118
I did once.

350
00:20:29,194 --> 00:20:31,719
Telly's the only guy
I've had sex with.

351
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:35,392
- I thought you had sex with A.J.
- No, we just messed around.

352
00:20:40,072 --> 00:20:41,972
That's the whole thing,
you know?

353
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:44,235
You hear of all these diseases.

354
00:20:44,309 --> 00:20:46,869
Disease this,
disease that...

355
00:20:46,945 --> 00:20:50,312
fucking everyone's dying and shit.
That shit is made up.

356
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,316
I don't know no kid with AIDS.

357
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:54,978
Ain't no one I know died
from that shit.

358
00:20:55,053 --> 00:20:57,681
Fucking, that's just
some make-believe story.

359
00:20:57,756 --> 00:21:00,350
(laughter and clapping)

360
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:01,687
It's bullshit!

361
00:21:03,895 --> 00:21:06,989
We all going to die anyway.
I'm going to go out fucking.

362
00:21:07,065 --> 00:21:08,862
- Yeah.
- You know what I'm saying?

363
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:15,030
(hooting)

364
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:21,301
One guy got tested.
He was negative.

365
00:21:21,380 --> 00:21:22,972
This other guy...

366
00:21:23,048 --> 00:21:26,245
he'd fucked only two other girls,
and they were virgins,

367
00:21:26,318 --> 00:21:28,218
so he was safe.

368
00:21:28,287 --> 00:21:32,246
But then this other guy I just fucked,
which was a mistake.

369
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:34,849
Heat of the moment
kind of thing.

370
00:21:34,926 --> 00:21:37,861
But I went to the clinic last week
with Jenny...

371
00:21:37,929 --> 00:21:39,988
to get ourselves checked,
to be safe.

372
00:21:40,065 --> 00:21:41,498
Jenny went?

373
00:21:41,566 --> 00:21:44,729
She got tested with me
so that I didn't have to be alone.

374
00:21:44,803 --> 00:21:46,532
Word, they ask
a lot of questions?

375
00:21:46,605 --> 00:21:48,334
Jenny...

376
00:21:48,407 --> 00:21:49,704
how old are you?

377
00:21:49,775 --> 00:21:50,901
16.

378
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,410
How many people have you
had vaginal intercourse with?

379
00:21:53,478 --> 00:21:56,675
- One.
- Were you protected?

380
00:21:56,748 --> 00:21:57,510
No.

381
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:01,979
- How old are you, honey?
- 17.

382
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,749
How many people have
you had vaginal intercourse with?

383
00:22:04,790 --> 00:22:05,722
Altogether?

384
00:22:05,791 --> 00:22:07,520
Yes, altogether.

385
00:22:07,592 --> 00:22:10,720
I'd say eight.
Maybe nine.

386
00:22:10,796 --> 00:22:13,856
How many times
did you go in unprotected?

387
00:22:13,932 --> 00:22:15,661
Four times
I went unprotected.

388
00:22:15,734 --> 00:22:17,258
Maybe it was three.

389
00:22:18,270 --> 00:22:20,238
Have you ever had anal
intercourse?

390
00:22:20,305 --> 00:22:21,397
No.

391
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:26,710
Have you ever had anal
intercourse?

392
00:22:26,778 --> 00:22:28,040
Yeah.

393
00:22:28,113 --> 00:22:30,172
With how many
different people?

394
00:22:34,953 --> 00:22:38,389
I think three,
but I'm not sure.

395
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:40,516
Were they wearing condoms?

396
00:22:40,592 --> 00:22:43,527
Yes, with two of them.
Twice I didn't.

397
00:22:43,595 --> 00:22:44,789
I didn't...

398
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:46,125
two times.

399
00:22:46,965 --> 00:22:49,991
We're going to draw
some blood from you.

400
00:22:50,068 --> 00:22:51,968
Come back in seven days...

401
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:55,632
and we should have the results
of your tests, okay?

402
00:22:55,707 --> 00:22:57,538
Thanks.

403
00:22:58,210 --> 00:23:00,303
You see that
pork fried rice store?

404
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:01,311
The Chinese joint?

405
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,507
Yeah.
My cousin lives right up there.

406
00:23:03,582 --> 00:23:06,312
He's mad. Crazy.
His name is Harmonoff.

407
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:10,854
One time we went to
Special Olympics on a school trip.

408
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:13,390
Seventh grade, whatever.

409
00:23:13,458 --> 00:23:16,120
He tried to pick up
these retarded bitches.

410
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:19,254
That nigga's crazy.
He's still got a thing for them.

411
00:23:19,331 --> 00:23:21,595
He caught one
dope bitch that day...

412
00:23:21,666 --> 00:23:23,725
she had those leg braces
and shit.

413
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:25,599
But she had a fat ass.

414
00:23:25,670 --> 00:23:27,331
You're crazy. Ruthless.

415
00:23:27,406 --> 00:23:31,570
He brought her into the bathroom
and fucked the shit out of her.

416
00:23:31,643 --> 00:23:35,079
He was telling me that the leg
braces were scratching up his shit.

417
00:23:35,147 --> 00:23:38,082
He hit her hard, yo.
She was all drooling and shit.

418
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:54,531
So, he's pretty crazy;
he'll do whatever to bust a nut.

419
00:23:54,599 --> 00:23:56,191
- You know?
- That's ruthless shit.

420
00:23:56,268 --> 00:24:00,568
He wanted to take the leg braces off,
but he was just like "Fuck it."

421
00:24:00,639 --> 00:24:02,630
"Let's hit this up real quick."

422
00:24:04,242 --> 00:24:05,709
Telly: Like quickie style.

423
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:11,881
¢Ü The summer's gone ¢Ü

424
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:14,885
¢Ü And all the roses dying... ¢Ü

425
00:24:16,354 --> 00:24:18,845
Man, this guy's really good, yo.

426
00:24:18,924 --> 00:24:20,858
He reminds me of my uncle.

427
00:24:20,926 --> 00:24:23,724
- I bet he brings mad dough in, yo.
- Hells, yeah.

428
00:24:26,531 --> 00:24:30,592
¢Ü... when summer's
in the meadow ¢Ü

429
00:24:30,669 --> 00:24:37,598
¢Ü Or when the valley's hushed
and white with snow ¢Ü

430
00:24:37,676 --> 00:24:41,203
¢Ü It's I'll be here ¢Ü

431
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,045
¢Ü I n sunshine or shadow... ¢Ü

432
00:24:56,361 --> 00:24:59,194
I don't think I want
to be seein' him anymore.

433
00:24:59,264 --> 00:25:01,664
I want to date other people.
I don't know.

434
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:05,031
I think he's mad at me
or something. But who cares?

435
00:25:05,070 --> 00:25:07,038
It's like,
"Get off your high horse.

436
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:10,336
If I want to see other guys
I'll see other guys."

437
00:25:10,408 --> 00:25:12,035
So it's just like...

438
00:25:12,110 --> 00:25:14,305
I can't deal with
that jealous crap.

439
00:25:14,379 --> 00:25:17,041
I don't know why I see him
in the first place.

440
00:25:17,115 --> 00:25:20,551
He's a jerk!
Giving me a hard time. That crap.

441
00:25:20,619 --> 00:25:22,849
I think I'm just gonna
dump him completely.

442
00:25:22,921 --> 00:25:26,516
I was just tryin' to be nice,
but if he's gonna get...

443
00:25:26,591 --> 00:25:28,058
(coughing)

444
00:25:28,126 --> 00:25:29,855
It must have been
something I ate.

445
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,725
Ruby, follow me.

446
00:25:31,796 --> 00:25:34,094
- Wish me luck.
- Good luck.

447
00:25:44,242 --> 00:25:45,334
Jenny...

448
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:07,660
You tested negative

449
00:26:07,732 --> 00:26:11,168
for all sexually transmitted
diseases and infections.

450
00:26:11,236 --> 00:26:12,965
Yes!

451
00:26:13,038 --> 00:26:14,505
You're clean.

452
00:26:14,573 --> 00:26:16,541
I can't tell you
how nervous I was.

453
00:26:16,608 --> 00:26:18,041
I didn't sleep last night.

454
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:20,509
Now you have to be careful,
Ruby, okay?

455
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:24,709
I want you to take these
pamphlets and read them.

456
00:26:24,783 --> 00:26:26,614
And, Ruby, read them.

457
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:34,859
Jenny, you've tested
positive for the H IV virus.

458
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:35,915
What?

459
00:26:35,994 --> 00:26:37,985
The test isn't 100% accurate.

460
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,928
I tested positive?

461
00:26:39,998 --> 00:26:41,863
I'm sorry.

462
00:26:41,933 --> 00:26:43,833
I only had sex with Telly.

463
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:50,799
I just came to keep
Ruby company.

464
00:27:08,293 --> 00:27:09,885
Yo, I want to fuck Darcy.

465
00:27:09,961 --> 00:27:11,087
Who?

466
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:12,629
You know Darcy.
Bennie's little sister.

467
00:27:12,697 --> 00:27:14,062
You like her, uh-huh?

468
00:27:14,132 --> 00:27:15,997
Yo, I liked her
for a while, yeah.

469
00:27:16,067 --> 00:27:17,056
Darcy, yo?

470
00:27:17,135 --> 00:27:20,104
She's so little,
innocent and pretty.

471
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,798
She's only 13, man.

472
00:27:21,873 --> 00:27:23,431
Shit.

473
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:26,238
You remember the last week
at the block party?

474
00:27:26,311 --> 00:27:28,905
She was handing out
watermelon slices.

475
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:32,916
I just sat across from her
and started watching her.

476
00:27:32,984 --> 00:27:35,043
- She was eating this watermelon.
- U h-huh.

477
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,851
J uices just start runnin'
off her chin onto her shirt.

478
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:40,049
After about three seconds, yo,

479
00:27:40,125 --> 00:27:43,117
I got the biggest
fuckin' hard on, yo.

480
00:27:43,194 --> 00:27:46,994
I just wanted to take out my dick
right there and start jerking off.

481
00:27:47,065 --> 00:27:48,726
Shit, yo.

482
00:27:48,800 --> 00:27:51,462
Like at that point,
and moment, like...

483
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:54,004
she was like a vision
of perfection.

484
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:55,733
I know what you mean, yo.

485
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:59,573
Like, like she represented
everything holy about a virgin.

486
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:02,511
I know what you're saying.
I know.

487
00:28:02,614 --> 00:28:04,241
She works for Nasa, man.

488
00:28:04,282 --> 00:28:06,250
I think she promotes for them.

489
00:28:06,317 --> 00:28:09,047
I'm going to fuck her
tonight, I swear to God.

490
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:12,180
How you going to fuck
two virgins in one day?

491
00:28:12,257 --> 00:28:15,124
That shit's got to be
against the law or some shit.

492
00:28:15,193 --> 00:28:18,720
I'm still going to fuck her.
I'll bet you money I'll fuck her.

493
00:28:18,797 --> 00:28:20,594
Bet, yo.

494
00:28:30,008 --> 00:28:32,238
¢Ü I have no legs ¢Ü

495
00:28:32,310 --> 00:28:34,540

¢Ü I have no legs ¢Ü

Run by the park and get zooted?
See what the fellas are doing?

498
00:28:39,718 --> 00:28:42,778
Yeah, yeah.
But I also got to run home.

499
00:28:42,854 --> 00:28:44,719
Yeah, yeah,
that's cool. That's cool.

500
00:28:46,858 --> 00:28:48,723
¢Ü I have no legs ¢Ü

501
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:53,354

¢Ü I have no legs ¢Ü

511
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:42,309
Peter, is Mom there?

512
00:29:42,380 --> 00:29:44,905
No, I need to speak to Mom.

513
00:29:44,983 --> 00:29:46,450
(sighs)

514
00:29:46,518 --> 00:29:48,247
Peter, where's Mommy?

515
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,221
No, I can't talk to you
right now.

516
00:29:53,224 --> 00:29:56,057
Yeah, I hear it.

517
00:30:00,832 --> 00:30:02,231
J ust tell her that...

518
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:05,529
Never mind.
J ust go watch television.

519
00:30:06,971 --> 00:30:08,268
(sobbing)

520
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:12,910
Come on.
It's gonna be okay.

521
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:16,511
It's gonna be okay.

522
00:30:17,215 --> 00:30:20,844
I'm gonna have to tell
my little brother I'm gonna die.

523
00:30:20,919 --> 00:30:23,979
I can't make him
his lunches any more.

524
00:30:24,055 --> 00:30:28,185
Come on. I mean, don't cry.
We'll work it out.

525
00:30:28,259 --> 00:30:30,124
I only did it once.

526
00:30:43,007 --> 00:30:44,838
I gotta go.
I gotta find Telly.

527
00:30:44,909 --> 00:30:46,638
Don't go anywhere,
just stay with me.

528
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:50,044
- No, I gotta find him.
- Then I'm coming.

529
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,139
- No, I just gotta go.
- Jen...

530
00:30:52,717 --> 00:30:54,241
Jenny!

531
00:31:12,804 --> 00:31:14,704
- What's up, yo?
- Yo, chillin'.

532
00:31:42,100 --> 00:31:42,862
Hi, Mom.

533
00:31:42,934 --> 00:31:44,526
Hi, Telly,
where you been?

534
00:31:44,602 --> 00:31:46,593
- What's up?
- Hi, Casper.

535
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:50,373
We were just out
trying to find jobs.

536
00:31:50,441 --> 00:31:53,239
- Any luck?
- No, no.

537
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:58,177
What are you gonna do
about money this summer?

538
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:02,376
I don't know. Find a job.

539
00:32:02,453 --> 00:32:03,920
Can I borrow some money?

540
00:32:03,988 --> 00:32:07,082
Your dad made me promise
not to give you any money

541
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:08,785
until you find a job.

542
00:32:08,860 --> 00:32:11,522
- Then I won't need your money.
- That's right.

543
00:32:11,596 --> 00:32:13,996
Come on, Mom.

544
00:32:14,065 --> 00:32:16,056
N - O.

545
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:21,872
Come on, Casper.

546
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,410
Damn, Telly.
Your little brother's getting big.

547
00:32:26,477 --> 00:32:28,445
Yeah, man, I know.

548
00:32:32,350 --> 00:32:34,910
Yo, Telly, your mom's
titties are looking good.

549
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:36,112
Shut the fuck up, man.

550
00:32:36,187 --> 00:32:37,449
Damn.

551
00:32:46,564 --> 00:32:48,191
Cardizems.

552
00:33:00,745 --> 00:33:02,508
Hey, how do these things work?

553
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:05,105
How am I supposed to know?

554
00:33:06,951 --> 00:33:08,612
How much you gonna take?

555
00:33:08,686 --> 00:33:10,415
I don't know.
How much you want?

556
00:33:10,488 --> 00:33:13,389
$10. $15's good, though.

557
00:33:23,001 --> 00:33:25,595
You ever take one of these
things out with your teeth?

558
00:33:25,670 --> 00:33:27,035
Stoops.

559
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:30,975
Your girls don't bleed yet,
that's why.

560
00:33:31,042 --> 00:33:33,636
My girls got mad flavor.

561
00:33:34,712 --> 00:33:36,145
Heavy flow.

562
00:33:49,494 --> 00:33:51,587
$15 for me.
$10 for you.

563
00:33:51,662 --> 00:33:54,062
You cheap motherfucker, yo.

564
00:33:54,132 --> 00:33:55,759
But I'm supporting your ass.

565
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:58,028
Thanks a lot.

566
00:33:58,102 --> 00:33:59,535
Thievin' bastard.

567
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,363
The fuck outta here, cat.

568
00:34:04,809 --> 00:34:06,902
It's damn hot out!

569
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:09,037
It's a fucking sauna
in here, man.

570
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:12,842
Yo, is crazy hot out.

571
00:34:12,917 --> 00:34:14,748
Word, yo.

572
00:34:14,819 --> 00:34:16,844
Shit.

573
00:34:21,025 --> 00:34:22,788
Come on, nigga.

574
00:34:22,860 --> 00:34:24,919
You think Darcy
will be at Nasa tonight?

575
00:34:24,996 --> 00:34:26,463
Yeah, probably.

576
00:34:26,531 --> 00:34:28,465
You got any weed
around here?

577
00:34:28,533 --> 00:34:31,263
No. We should run by the park
and pick up some.

578
00:34:31,335 --> 00:34:32,996
Maybe Darcy'll be there.

579
00:34:33,071 --> 00:34:34,663
True. True.

580
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:37,173
Yo, I gotta start wearin'
more hats.

581
00:34:39,744 --> 00:34:41,837
This is my tape, man.

582
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:43,505
Hey, my hair looks busted, B.

583
00:34:43,581 --> 00:34:45,947
- I'm gonna get buff, B.
- You are?

584
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:46,915
Hells, yeah.

585
00:34:46,984 --> 00:34:50,147
The other day, this Chinese bitch
said I'd look good with muscles.

586
00:34:51,689 --> 00:34:54,954
I'll get mad diesel. Fuck up
any nigga that step to me.

587
00:34:56,694 --> 00:34:59,254
You got hairy armpits.
Word up.

588
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,389
You got Buckwheat
in a headlock there.

589
00:35:01,499 --> 00:35:02,659
You want some?

590
00:35:02,700 --> 00:35:04,668
Get the fuck out of here
with that.

591
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:06,669
- You fucking stink, dude.
- So?

592
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:07,795
You stink.

593
00:35:07,872 --> 00:35:12,138
That shit gives me a rash
all over my armpits and my stomach.

594
00:35:12,210 --> 00:35:14,235
I like my smell.
It's fuckin' natural.

595
00:35:14,312 --> 00:35:15,779
You still stink.

596
00:35:15,847 --> 00:35:17,439
Your mother stinks.

597
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:21,351
These chips are stale.

598
00:35:22,820 --> 00:35:24,651
Look at this busted-ass nigga.

599
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:28,258
That's me, nigga.

600
00:35:28,326 --> 00:35:29,850
Me and your bitch.

601
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,053
Stoops.

602
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:35,263
TV: He wants to spend
time together.

603
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:36,857
I hardly know my old man.

604
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:40,931
Shh...

605
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,905
I'm going out
for a little while.

606
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:45,135
- When are you gonna be back?
- Not too late.

607
00:35:45,209 --> 00:35:46,870
4:30 in the morning?

608
00:35:46,944 --> 00:35:48,707
Not too late.

609
00:35:50,014 --> 00:35:53,575
You sure I can't get
any money?

610
00:35:53,651 --> 00:35:57,246
If I had some, maybe.
Right now, I don't have a penny.

611
00:36:02,226 --> 00:36:04,251
All right, then. Bye.

612
00:36:12,270 --> 00:36:13,737
(door slams)

613
00:36:13,804 --> 00:36:16,034
Shit.

614
00:36:45,336 --> 00:36:46,462
What's up, Ras?

615
00:36:46,537 --> 00:36:48,505
Casper.

616
00:36:50,474 --> 00:36:53,841
Back off of my customer
there, man.

617
00:36:56,280 --> 00:36:57,907
Ras, you got some?

618
00:36:57,982 --> 00:36:59,074
Yeah, mon.

619
00:36:59,150 --> 00:37:02,244
Let me check out a dime
of that.

620
00:37:02,353 --> 00:37:03,684
Come here.

621
00:37:04,355 --> 00:37:06,846
I want no twigs
or pebbles neither.

622
00:37:06,924 --> 00:37:08,824
I wouldn't do you.

623
00:37:16,133 --> 00:37:19,102
Check this.
Good sinsemilla.

624
00:37:19,170 --> 00:37:20,364
Smells delicious.

625
00:37:20,438 --> 00:37:22,531
- I the best.
- Definitely.

626
00:37:22,607 --> 00:37:25,303
How about a dime of that shit?

627
00:37:25,376 --> 00:37:27,105
Drop it.

628
00:37:33,484 --> 00:37:35,111
Good looking out.

629
00:37:35,186 --> 00:37:36,619
Come check me out again.

630
00:37:36,687 --> 00:37:39,121
- See you tomorrow.
- Later, man.

631
00:37:54,338 --> 00:37:57,307
Yo, Paul, is Telly there?

632
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,172
Is Telly there?

633
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:00,767
This is Paul.
Who's this?

634
00:38:00,878 --> 00:38:02,937
It's Jenny.
J ust tell me if Telly's there.

635
00:38:02,980 --> 00:38:04,174
Hello, Jenny.

636
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:06,512
Wanna come upstairs
and make out with me?

637
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:09,109
Listen, I'm fucking serious.
Where's Telly?

638
00:38:09,186 --> 00:38:11,154
Telly's not here.

639
00:38:11,222 --> 00:38:13,520
I think he went downtown
with Casper.

640
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:19,657
My dolly's black Lucy.

641
00:38:38,382 --> 00:38:41,215
Telly: Tracy's talking
to another guy over there.

642
00:38:41,285 --> 00:38:42,843
Casper: Tracy?

643
00:38:42,920 --> 00:38:45,320
Whatever.
She can suck my dick.

644
00:38:51,829 --> 00:38:52,887
What's up, nigga?

645
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:57,226
What's up, dude?

646
00:38:58,536 --> 00:38:59,525
What's up, guy?

647
00:39:10,614 --> 00:39:13,412
Shut the fuck up,
you four-eyed bitch!

648
00:39:34,505 --> 00:39:38,032
(rapping)

649
00:39:47,685 --> 00:39:49,414
I tell you what.
That body.

650
00:39:49,487 --> 00:39:51,250
Yeah, I'm in that piece,
kid.

651
00:40:04,268 --> 00:40:05,735
- What's up, Harold?
- What's up?

652
00:40:07,605 --> 00:40:10,130
- Where you at?
- I'm right here, you know?

653
00:40:10,207 --> 00:40:13,301
- You going out tonight?
- Yeah, maybe Nasa or some shit.

654
00:40:13,377 --> 00:40:15,038
Yo, word?
You're on the list?

655
00:40:15,112 --> 00:40:17,842
Probably.
But fuck that shit. I'll sneak in.

656
00:40:17,915 --> 00:40:19,906
I need some female
vagina tonight.

657
00:40:19,984 --> 00:40:22,646
I had some female vagina
last night.

658
00:40:22,953 --> 00:40:24,648
You did? All right!

659
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:27,922
You want to do any pot?
You got a Phillie?

660
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:31,189
- Got one.
- Make a trade.

661
00:40:34,498 --> 00:40:36,329
You got this in the park?

662
00:40:37,535 --> 00:40:38,797
Break that shit up.

663
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:41,929
Break it.

664
00:40:46,143 --> 00:40:47,770
Scrape it.

665
00:40:49,213 --> 00:40:50,908
Lick it.

666
00:40:53,017 --> 00:40:54,712
Dump it.

667
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:16,901
You got it.

668
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:20,576
Smoke it.

669
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,615
(speaking Spanish)

670
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:46,931
What's up?

671
00:41:52,543 --> 00:41:54,010
Can I fuck with that?

672
00:41:54,078 --> 00:41:55,705
Sure.

673
00:42:01,919 --> 00:42:03,784
Yeah, boy.

674
00:42:03,854 --> 00:42:06,049
(coughing)

675
00:42:09,293 --> 00:42:11,488
Mad hot, right?

676
00:42:11,562 --> 00:42:12,426
Mad hot.

677
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:14,020
I want to go swimmin', kid.

678
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:16,032
Word.

679
00:42:16,100 --> 00:42:17,465
Look at that shit, man.

680
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:19,864
Gay guys.

681
00:42:19,937 --> 00:42:20,995
That shit is sick.

682
00:42:21,071 --> 00:42:22,538
Faggots!

683
00:42:22,606 --> 00:42:23,971
Fucking faggots!

684
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:25,508
Butt pirate!

685
00:42:25,576 --> 00:42:26,838
Bitch ass faggot!

686
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:30,480
Fuck out of here,
motherfucker!

687
00:42:30,548 --> 00:42:32,277
J ungle fever.

688
00:42:36,186 --> 00:42:38,518
Fucking faggot!
Bitch ass faggot!

689
00:42:44,161 --> 00:42:45,958
How can you hang out
with Casper?

690
00:42:46,030 --> 00:42:47,964
That nigga's a jerk.

691
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:50,626
- You think?
- Yeah, yo. I've always hated him.

692
00:42:50,701 --> 00:42:53,169
He used to eat glue
in the seventh grade.

693
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:54,727
- Still does.
- I hate him.

694
00:42:57,408 --> 00:42:59,899
Give me a taste of that
motherfuckin' chronic, kid.

695
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:04,810
This weed is mad good, yo.

696
00:43:06,116 --> 00:43:07,344
This your board?

697
00:43:21,932 --> 00:43:23,763
- Watch it.
- Sorry.

698
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:26,098
Well, watch where
the fuck you're skating at.

699
00:43:26,170 --> 00:43:28,035
- Watch where you walk, yo.
- What?

700
00:43:28,105 --> 00:43:29,936
- What I said, yo.
- What?

701
00:43:30,007 --> 00:43:31,201
Forget it, B. Nothin'.

702
00:43:31,275 --> 00:43:32,105
What?

703
00:43:32,176 --> 00:43:33,609
Whatever, yo.
J ust forget it.

704
00:43:33,677 --> 00:43:35,542
Do you want to get fucked up,
motherfucker?

705
00:43:35,613 --> 00:43:38,138
- What's up, then?
- What do you mean?

706
00:43:38,215 --> 00:43:40,706
- What's up?
- What's up, motherfucker?

707
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:53,396
Casper: Suck my dick.
Fuckin' suck my dick.

708
00:44:01,639 --> 00:44:04,073
- Beat his ass, fuckers.
- Motherfucker!

709
00:44:04,141 --> 00:44:05,540
Punk ass motherfucker.

710
00:44:33,037 --> 00:44:35,028
He's out, man!

711
00:44:35,105 --> 00:44:37,335
Word up, that shit is out!

712
00:44:44,915 --> 00:44:47,475
Now get in my way, bitch!

713
00:44:47,551 --> 00:44:48,745
Motherfucker.

714
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,422
Man: Excuse me.

715
00:44:56,493 --> 00:44:58,791
Can I ask you a question?

716
00:45:00,464 --> 00:45:02,694
Can I ask you a question?

717
00:45:02,766 --> 00:45:04,996
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to be a pest.

718
00:45:05,903 --> 00:45:08,997
It's just that I was looking
at you and you look upset.

719
00:45:09,840 --> 00:45:12,707
I like looking at you, but...

720
00:45:12,776 --> 00:45:15,540
but your face looks upset.

721
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:16,943
So I was wondering...

722
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:19,676
if I could be
of any assistance.

723
00:45:20,651 --> 00:45:22,482
Maybe cheer you up
or something?

724
00:45:22,553 --> 00:45:24,544
No, I'm okay, thanks.

725
00:45:24,621 --> 00:45:26,612
Okay?

726
00:45:26,690 --> 00:45:29,420
Because you don't look okay.

727
00:45:29,493 --> 00:45:31,688
You're a very pretty
young lady.

728
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,229
It's just...

729
00:45:33,297 --> 00:45:35,356
that your face looks troubled.

730
00:45:35,432 --> 00:45:37,423
It's just been a bad day.

731
00:45:38,035 --> 00:45:39,366
Miss...

732
00:45:40,904 --> 00:45:44,965
Would I be prying
if I asked you what was wrong?

733
00:45:45,042 --> 00:45:46,942
Would I be prying?

734
00:45:47,010 --> 00:45:48,944
Everything's wrong.

735
00:45:49,012 --> 00:45:51,947
No, not everything.

736
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:54,950
The sun is still shining.

737
00:45:55,018 --> 00:45:57,350
It's a beautiful day.

738
00:45:58,388 --> 00:46:00,253
Some things are okay, right?

739
00:46:00,357 --> 00:46:01,915
I guess so.

740
00:46:01,959 --> 00:46:03,722
Did you break up
with your boyfriend?

741
00:46:03,794 --> 00:46:04,419
No.

742
00:46:04,495 --> 00:46:05,985
You in trouble with the law?

743
00:46:06,063 --> 00:46:07,223
No.

744
00:46:07,297 --> 00:46:09,231
Am I getting closer?

745
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:10,288
That's better.

746
00:46:10,367 --> 00:46:12,562
You look like a prom queen
when you smile.

747
00:46:12,636 --> 00:46:14,297
A glamour girl.

748
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:18,864
When I was a kid...

749
00:46:20,077 --> 00:46:22,807
I had a crush
on the prom queen.

750
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:24,677
Darlene Lewis.

751
00:46:25,849 --> 00:46:28,409
She had a big black mole...

752
00:46:28,485 --> 00:46:30,953
in the middle of her face...

753
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:34,013
that used to make me
so excited.

754
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:36,025
You look a little bit
like her.

755
00:46:36,093 --> 00:46:38,084
Right around the cheeks
and the chin.

756
00:46:38,162 --> 00:46:39,094
Thanks.

757
00:46:39,163 --> 00:46:42,621
Boy, did I have a crush
on her.

758
00:46:42,699 --> 00:46:46,226
She was the first girl
I put my tongue in her mouth.

759
00:46:48,038 --> 00:46:51,633
Hey, look. Whatever it is,
just forget about it.

760
00:46:51,708 --> 00:46:55,075
Life is too short.
Try to be happy.

761
00:46:55,145 --> 00:46:57,705
But what if you
can't make yourself happy?

762
00:46:57,781 --> 00:46:59,112
Well...

763
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:02,482
...then I don't know.

764
00:47:02,553 --> 00:47:05,147
You know what you do then?
You forget.

765
00:47:05,222 --> 00:47:06,746
Block it out.

766
00:47:07,791 --> 00:47:09,759
I remember...

767
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:14,628
when my grandmother told me
how to be happy.

768
00:47:14,698 --> 00:47:15,756
She said, "Leon...

769
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:17,994
Leon,
my darling little grandson,

770
00:47:18,068 --> 00:47:19,695
if you want to be happy...

771
00:47:19,770 --> 00:47:21,294
don't think.

772
00:47:21,905 --> 00:47:24,874
Don't bump into any walls.

773
00:47:24,942 --> 00:47:26,807
If you stutter...

774
00:47:26,877 --> 00:47:28,742
don't talk."

775
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:30,939
I listened to my grandmother.

776
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:32,948
Look at me now.

777
00:47:33,016 --> 00:47:35,484
Couldn't be happier.

778
00:47:35,552 --> 00:47:38,146
That's life.

779
00:47:38,989 --> 00:47:40,684
Darcy!

780
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:43,284
Darcy!

781
00:47:44,595 --> 00:47:46,756
Darcy!

782
00:47:47,731 --> 00:47:49,824
Darcy!

783
00:47:50,434 --> 00:47:52,402
Darcy!

784
00:47:52,970 --> 00:47:54,961
Bennie, what's up?

785
00:47:55,038 --> 00:47:56,699
Nothing. What's up?

786
00:47:56,773 --> 00:47:59,139
Yo, is your sister home?

787
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:01,473
- You want Darcy?
- Yeah.

788
00:48:01,578 --> 00:48:03,842
Hold on.
Let me see if she's here.

789
00:48:05,115 --> 00:48:07,879
Yo, hurry the fuck up, man.
I want to go swimming.

790
00:48:07,951 --> 00:48:10,078
Hold up, man. Damn.

791
00:48:12,155 --> 00:48:13,315
Hey.

792
00:48:13,390 --> 00:48:16,689
Hey, what's up?
What are you doin' right now?

793
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:19,194
I was just getting ready
to take a bath.

794
00:48:19,263 --> 00:48:21,493
Don't take a bath.
Come swim with us.

795
00:48:21,565 --> 00:48:23,556
Hi, Darcy!

796
00:48:23,634 --> 00:48:26,296
Hi, Kim.
Hi, Joy.

797
00:48:26,370 --> 00:48:28,668
Come on.
Come swimmin'.

798
00:48:28,739 --> 00:48:29,831
Right now?

799
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,374
Yeah. Come on.

800
00:48:31,441 --> 00:48:32,908
Hold on.

801
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:36,935
So that's your new girl, huh?

802
00:48:37,014 --> 00:48:38,276
I hope so. For now.

803
00:48:38,348 --> 00:48:39,815
You like 'em kinda young,
right?

804
00:48:39,883 --> 00:48:41,145
Fuckin' babies.

805
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:43,743
I like 'em new.
Not like you.

806
00:48:43,820 --> 00:48:45,151
Fuck you.

807
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:47,816
Damn, bitch,
don't kill the shit.

808
00:48:47,891 --> 00:48:49,950
What the fuck?

809
00:48:50,027 --> 00:48:52,552
You think we might've killed
that guy?

810
00:48:52,629 --> 00:48:53,755
No, man.

811
00:48:53,830 --> 00:48:54,762
You sure?

812
00:48:54,831 --> 00:48:55,991
Casper: I don't know,
though.

813
00:48:56,066 --> 00:48:59,763
I kicked him so many times,
my fuckin' toes are broken.

814
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:04,640
No, man. We didn't kill him,
'cause when we were through,

815
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,505
he was all twitching.

816
00:49:06,576 --> 00:49:09,704
Word, he was crawling
around the floor and shit.

817
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:11,680
You guys are fuckin' sick,
you know that?

818
00:49:11,748 --> 00:49:14,649
That's all right.
That's how I'm living.

819
00:49:16,687 --> 00:49:18,348
It's unreal out here,
right, Harold?

820
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:39,672
Ready.

821
00:49:39,743 --> 00:49:41,608
You look nice.

822
00:50:28,725 --> 00:50:30,420
Hey, girl, what's up?

823
00:50:30,494 --> 00:50:32,894
Nothin'.
J ust some crazy shit.

824
00:50:32,963 --> 00:50:34,294
Have you seen Telly around?

825
00:50:34,364 --> 00:50:36,025
Yeah.
Speaking of stupid shit...

826
00:50:36,099 --> 00:50:38,294
him and his ape-ass
of a friend, Casper,

827
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:39,892
they almost just
killed some kid.

828
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:42,495
- What happened?
- Some messy little scrap.

829
00:50:42,572 --> 00:50:45,439
- You know that bullshit.
- Yeah. You know where he went?

830
00:50:45,509 --> 00:50:48,535
I don't know. He said some shit
about meeting Darcy.

831
00:50:48,612 --> 00:50:51,274
- I think he likes her now.
- Bennie's little sister?

832
00:50:51,348 --> 00:50:53,179
She should be
at Nasa tonight.

833
00:50:53,250 --> 00:50:55,775
Why are you looking for him?
You like him now?

834
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,814
Come on, man.
H urry up.

835
00:50:59,890 --> 00:51:02,154
Get in this piece.

836
00:51:02,259 --> 00:51:04,090
H urry up, Kim.

837
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:09,160
Harold: You think I ain't
motherfuckin' hot naked?

838
00:51:09,232 --> 00:51:11,291
Shit.

839
00:51:11,368 --> 00:51:14,963
I'm jumpin' in before everybody.
I don't give a fuck.

840
00:51:15,038 --> 00:51:18,098
Girl: Take your fucking clothes off
and shut the fuck up, Harold.

841
00:51:28,185 --> 00:51:32,281
Motherfucker,
you know what I'm saying?

842
00:51:32,355 --> 00:51:35,381
Damn, Kim. Your body
looks fucking dope.

843
00:51:37,127 --> 00:51:38,958
You think so?

844
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,519
Hells, yeah.
I'm serious, yo.

845
00:51:40,597 --> 00:51:43,623
It's funny, you don't know
how dope a girl's body is

846
00:51:43,700 --> 00:51:45,668
until she takes
all her clothes off.

847
00:51:46,703 --> 00:51:48,398
It looks good, right?

848
00:51:48,472 --> 00:51:50,736
Think it don't
when it does?

849
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:53,002
Aw, you don't look
so bad yourself, Casper.

850
00:51:54,911 --> 00:51:58,074
That shit is rare.
What about me?

851
00:51:58,148 --> 00:52:01,276
That's what I like about you.
A girl's ass.

852
00:52:01,384 --> 00:52:04,478
Joy, ever seen
a black man's lasso?

853
00:52:04,521 --> 00:52:05,488
(laughter)

854
00:52:05,555 --> 00:52:08,080
Oh, my God!

855
00:52:13,530 --> 00:52:15,361
Harold: Look at it.

856
00:52:17,534 --> 00:52:20,059
Girl: Harold's dick is black
and beautiful. Look at him.

857
00:52:20,971 --> 00:52:22,939
All right. Chill.
Be quiet, be quiet.

858
00:52:24,941 --> 00:52:26,772
(flapping sounds resume)

859
00:52:29,513 --> 00:52:31,708
Look at that fuckin' shit.

860
00:52:31,781 --> 00:52:34,773
That's how I'm gonna be
up against your ass, like this.

861
00:52:34,851 --> 00:52:36,250
(flapping sounds and laughter)

862
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:44,093
It's all gonna be against your ass.
I'm gonna be on the floor, like,

863
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:45,685
down, break-break-breakin'
that shit.

864
00:52:45,762 --> 00:52:49,425
- You know what I'm saying?
- We've seen enough, Harold.

865
00:52:49,499 --> 00:52:52,468
Harold: Break your back.
Break, break, break.

866
00:52:52,536 --> 00:52:54,367
Hi-ho, Silver!

867
00:52:57,974 --> 00:53:01,535
Oh, shit!
That shit is cold.

868
00:53:01,645 --> 00:53:03,408
I'm going to piss in the pool.

869
00:53:04,714 --> 00:53:06,705
I'm tellin' you,
somebody's gonna piss in it.

870
00:53:06,783 --> 00:53:08,375
What's that?

871
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:11,079
Damn, girl,
that's my triple nipple.

872
00:53:16,259 --> 00:53:18,750
You're gonna give me
goose bumps.

873
00:53:24,301 --> 00:53:26,769
I've been thinkin' about you
a lot lately.

874
00:53:26,836 --> 00:53:28,269
- You have?
- Yeah.

875
00:53:28,338 --> 00:53:31,068
- After I seen you last week.
- At the block party.

876
00:53:31,141 --> 00:53:32,301
Yeah.

877
00:53:33,577 --> 00:53:35,875
I was looking for you
all day today.

878
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:37,743
You were?

879
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:39,805
I thought about you
when I woke up.

880
00:53:42,652 --> 00:53:46,554
"Where could Darcy be at?"
I was looking all over.

881
00:53:46,623 --> 00:53:50,753
I'll give you a dollar
if you let me suck your tit.

882
00:53:50,827 --> 00:53:54,228
No, though, I'm serious.
Either of you guys.

883
00:53:54,297 --> 00:53:57,164
What really makes you think
I'll let you suck my tits?

884
00:53:57,234 --> 00:54:00,829
I don't know. They're just
sittin' there all ripe and firm.

885
00:54:00,937 --> 00:54:03,235
It makes you want to
suck on them.

886
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:04,934
Don't touch!

887
00:54:05,976 --> 00:54:07,603
Harold: Yeah, me too.

888
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:11,214
Harold! Fuck you.

889
00:54:15,185 --> 00:54:17,278
I thought you had a girlfriend.

890
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:19,345
No, I ain't seeing nobody.

891
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:20,946
What about you?

892
00:54:21,024 --> 00:54:24,255
I can't. My mom won't let me
have a boyfriend.

893
00:54:24,327 --> 00:54:26,557
She won't?
Why not?

894
00:54:26,630 --> 00:54:28,097
I don't know.

895
00:54:28,164 --> 00:54:30,098
I guess it's 'cause
my sister Nicki...

896
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:32,600
had a baby when she was 15.

897
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:36,469
She was real young so my mom's
very protective over me.

898
00:54:36,539 --> 00:54:38,803
I can understand that.

899
00:54:40,443 --> 00:54:43,674
They just look so fucking good.

900
00:54:43,747 --> 00:54:46,807
Yo, I truth or dare
you guys to kiss each other.

901
00:54:46,883 --> 00:54:49,545
Sure.
We do it all the time.

902
00:54:52,656 --> 00:54:55,284
- Holy shit.
- Holy s... damn!

903
00:54:56,159 --> 00:54:58,320
Casper:
You guys are dykes, right?

904
00:54:58,395 --> 00:54:59,327
Shit!

905
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:03,663
- No.
- How can you kiss each other?

906
00:55:03,733 --> 00:55:05,098
How can you do that?

907
00:55:05,168 --> 00:55:06,965
It don't matter.
It just feels good.

908
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:08,163
It's not like we're gay.

909
00:55:08,238 --> 00:55:10,604
It's just like kissing
another person, a friend.

910
00:55:10,674 --> 00:55:12,869
- Oh, yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

911
00:55:12,942 --> 00:55:15,069
- Yeah, it's no big deal.
- Not at all.

912
00:55:15,145 --> 00:55:17,045
I don't know.
I never seen...

913
00:55:17,113 --> 00:55:19,047
no shit like that
in my life.

914
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:20,912
I think it looks nice,
though.

915
00:55:20,984 --> 00:55:23,885
- I know you think it's nice.
- Do it again.

916
00:55:23,953 --> 00:55:25,682
Fuck outta here,
you guys.

917
00:55:25,755 --> 00:55:27,552
Come on.
One more time.

918
00:55:27,624 --> 00:55:29,387
Shut the fuck up.

919
00:55:29,459 --> 00:55:32,792
You just did it. How the fuck
you ain't gonna do it again?

920
00:55:32,862 --> 00:55:34,989
- Do it again.
- Joy, do it again.

921
00:55:35,065 --> 00:55:37,499
- Stop sweatin' it, you guys
- Suck her titty then.

922
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:39,592
Why don't you suck
each other's dicks?

923
00:55:39,669 --> 00:55:41,864
- I'm not gay.
- I'll fuck you up.

924
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:43,701
Why don't you kiss me,
then?

925
00:55:43,773 --> 00:55:46,503
I don't want to kiss you.
You're not a girl.

926
00:55:46,576 --> 00:55:48,237
Yes, I am.

927
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:50,438
- What's that?
- A clit.

928
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:52,777
Harold will do anything
for a kiss.

929
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:54,714
I don't want to kiss you,
Harold.

930
00:55:54,784 --> 00:55:57,184
- Come on, just one kiss.
- You're so fuckin' aggressive.

931
00:55:57,253 --> 00:55:58,584
I got to represent.

932
00:55:58,655 --> 00:56:00,179
Casper:
"It just feels good, that's all."

933
00:56:00,290 --> 00:56:02,019
- Shut up.
- We're just friends.

934
00:56:02,058 --> 00:56:03,650
You made me horny
right now.

935
00:56:03,727 --> 00:56:06,389
Come on.
Why you gotta be like that?

936
00:56:06,463 --> 00:56:07,521
J ust one kiss.

937
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:09,326
(muffled screaming)

938
00:56:12,535 --> 00:56:14,264
Give her one kiss.
Come on, man.

939
00:56:16,072 --> 00:56:17,903
Harold. Fuck you.

940
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:35,755
I say we go skinny-dipping, man.
Fuck this.

941
00:56:35,825 --> 00:56:38,020
- Let's just do it.
- Want to go skinny-dipping?

942
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:42,054
You should come back
to Steven's house tonight.

943
00:56:42,132 --> 00:56:43,656
Tonight?

944
00:56:43,733 --> 00:56:46,725
Come on. We'll bug out.
His parents are away.

945
00:56:46,803 --> 00:56:49,636
I don't know.
I'm supposed to go to Nasa tonight.

946
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:52,436
You can rave another night.
A bunch of people'll be there.

947
00:56:52,509 --> 00:56:54,170
- It'll be fun, I promise.
- Yeah?

948
00:56:55,412 --> 00:56:58,040
Come on, it'll be nice.
It'll be a change of pace.

949
00:56:58,114 --> 00:57:00,582
That club shit gets boring.

950
00:57:11,895 --> 00:57:13,260
Jenny!
What's up, girl?

951
00:57:13,329 --> 00:57:15,160
- How you doin'?
- Let's go.

952
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:24,030
- Hey, Jenny.
- Hey.

953
00:57:45,829 --> 00:57:47,922
(techno music)

954
00:58:04,881 --> 00:58:07,315
How you doin'?
My name is Chi.

955
00:58:07,383 --> 00:58:08,543
Hi, Chi.

956
00:58:08,618 --> 00:58:09,880
All right, baby.

957
00:58:27,270 --> 00:58:28,999
Jenny-Jen!
What's up?

958
00:58:30,173 --> 00:58:32,107
- How do you feel?
- What's goin' on?

959
00:58:32,175 --> 00:58:34,109
Oh, shit!
I got to show you something.

960
00:58:34,177 --> 00:58:36,611
It's a spectacle.
It's a real spectacle.

961
00:58:36,679 --> 00:58:38,146
Jesus Christ, look at this!

962
00:58:45,822 --> 00:58:47,312
What's up?

963
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:02,397
Holy,
they're still goin'!

964
00:59:02,472 --> 00:59:05,532
It's like amazing
sexual exploration!

965
00:59:06,409 --> 00:59:09,708
You don't have to look at us.
It's not a free show.

966
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:19,477
Who are they?

967
00:59:19,556 --> 00:59:20,750
I don't know.

968
00:59:20,823 --> 00:59:23,656
I saw that one girl once before,
but she's like...

969
00:59:23,726 --> 00:59:26,661
like I don't know, like her face
is all mangled and shit.

970
00:59:26,729 --> 00:59:29,254
But they look like cornballs
from Jersey on Ecstasy,

971
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:30,663
feelin' the effects-tasy.

972
00:59:48,785 --> 00:59:51,777
I got something for you.
Check it out.

973
00:59:51,854 --> 00:59:53,788
It's a present.
It's a pres.

974
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:54,788
What is it?

975
00:59:54,857 --> 00:59:56,381
It's a pres, Jenny-Jen.

976
00:59:57,594 --> 00:59:59,152
It's like bang-up stuff.

977
01:00:00,830 --> 01:00:03,321
Yeah, it's called
the euphoric blockbuster

978
01:00:03,399 --> 01:00:05,731
and it's supposed
to make Special K look weak.

979
01:00:05,802 --> 01:00:06,894
- Take it.
- I don't...

980
01:00:06,970 --> 01:00:09,404
You look sad. Take it.
J ust swallow it.

981
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:11,940
I promise.
J ust swallow it.

982
01:00:12,008 --> 01:00:15,569
You swallow it, you be floatin'
up in heaven with the angels.

983
01:00:15,645 --> 01:00:17,613
You'll be singing
with Sammy Davis, Jr.

984
01:00:17,680 --> 01:00:20,376
You'll be kissing
Leo Gorcey on the chops.

985
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:23,010
Don't you know, don't you know
Trix are for kids, silly?

986
01:00:29,659 --> 01:00:31,149
Fucking asshole.

987
01:00:45,842 --> 01:00:47,002
Fuck that, nigga.

988
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:51,847
I'm gonna throw a rocket
at your ass.

989
01:01:43,833 --> 01:01:45,824
Yo, I got that fool.

990
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:48,737
I got that one.

991
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:53,608
What's up, nigga?
Niggas is buggin'.

992
01:02:00,149 --> 01:02:03,118
- Ass crazed, ugly bitch.
- Ass crazed.

993
01:02:03,186 --> 01:02:06,349
He said, he said, he said,
you're ass crazed.

994
01:02:06,422 --> 01:02:09,016
He said you're ass crazed.

995
01:02:09,092 --> 01:02:10,354
What's up, yo?

996
01:02:13,396 --> 01:02:14,727
Chillin', yo.

997
01:02:14,797 --> 01:02:17,664
Casper: What's a little nigga
like you doing drinking beer?

998
01:02:20,803 --> 01:02:23,271
What's up, Trix?

999
01:02:23,339 --> 01:02:25,307
Gravediggers.

1000
01:02:26,175 --> 01:02:28,769
Who'd want to make out
with those nasty-ass bitches, huh?

1001
01:02:31,748 --> 01:02:33,545
Them bitches that left.

1002
01:02:33,616 --> 01:02:36,585
You don't know pussy
has no face, Javier.

1003
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:38,279
- Stoops.
- Come on, man.

1004
01:02:38,354 --> 01:02:40,185
You've never seen a puss.

1005
01:02:40,256 --> 01:02:42,383
I've seen a lot of puss.

1006
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,525
Hey, yo, Casper.

1007
01:02:47,597 --> 01:02:49,588
- Why are you called Casper?
- It's my name.

1008
01:02:49,665 --> 01:02:51,656
Nobody's real name
is Casper.

1009
01:02:51,734 --> 01:02:53,258
That's my real name,
bitch.

1010
01:02:53,336 --> 01:02:56,703
Why do you keep asking me
the same shit for?

1011
01:02:56,773 --> 01:02:59,742
Why don't you go lose
some fuckin' weight for anyway?

1012
01:02:59,809 --> 01:03:01,834
Ought to go
to Weight Watchers.

1013
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:08,250
Casper: Nick, what kind of bitches
do you like to fuck?

1014
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:13,114
You like black bitches,
white bitches, what?

1015
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:16,181
- Anything. It don't matter.
- You like any old thing?

1016
01:03:16,259 --> 01:03:17,385
What age?

1017
01:03:21,430 --> 01:03:24,524
- 16, 15...
- I bet you're a virgin now.

1018
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,568
Well, bet whatever
you want to bet, then.

1019
01:03:26,636 --> 01:03:28,035
So when'd you hit it, yo?

1020
01:03:28,104 --> 01:03:29,867
Don't worry about that.

1021
01:03:29,939 --> 01:03:33,033
How'd you hit it then.
Doggy? What? Never, right?

1022
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:34,303
Probably a doggy.

1023
01:03:34,377 --> 01:03:36,242
You ever get a blow job?

1024
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:38,776
(choking and coughing)

1025
01:03:51,894 --> 01:03:54,055
Jenny, come on. Let's dance.
Come on, let's dance.

1026
01:03:54,130 --> 01:03:55,563
- What?
- Come on, let's dance.

1027
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:57,895
I don't feel all right.
You seen Telly around?

1028
01:03:57,967 --> 01:04:00,094
Telly's at Steven's house
with a bunch of people.

1029
01:04:00,203 --> 01:04:01,602
Come on, dance.

1030
01:04:01,637 --> 01:04:03,571
- Telly's at Steven's?
- Yeah, I guess so.

1031
01:04:34,770 --> 01:04:37,500
(giggling)

1032
01:04:51,787 --> 01:04:53,948
(retching)

1033
01:05:07,670 --> 01:05:09,797
Oh, shit.

1034
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:13,734
Why won't you give me
the time of day, Gertie?

1035
01:05:13,809 --> 01:05:14,741
Billy...

1036
01:05:14,810 --> 01:05:18,302
I love you, Gertie.
I feel like I love you.

1037
01:05:18,381 --> 01:05:21,612
You just best get yourself
out of my face, Billy.

1038
01:05:21,684 --> 01:05:24,118
What do you mean, Gertie?
I love you.

1039
01:05:24,186 --> 01:05:26,154
I want to do somethin' for you.

1040
01:05:26,222 --> 01:05:30,591
I want to take you out to dinner.
I want to take you out to eat.

1041
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:34,118
Billy, take your
cracker ass out of my face.

1042
01:05:34,196 --> 01:05:38,394
Gertie, I didn't mean it.
Gertie.

1043
01:05:38,467 --> 01:05:42,494
I want to buy you food,
corn dogs, anything.

1044
01:05:42,571 --> 01:05:44,835
Come on, baby.
J ust one more kiss.

1045
01:05:44,907 --> 01:05:46,340
No, Harold, no.

1046
01:05:46,409 --> 01:05:48,377
Come on, no.

1047
01:06:35,091 --> 01:06:36,581
You know what I'm sayin'?

1048
01:06:36,659 --> 01:06:39,389
I love you.
I want to get close to you.

1049
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:44,263
I want to, I want to feel you.
I want to be with you.

1050
01:06:44,333 --> 01:06:47,131
It's real like that.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1051
01:06:47,203 --> 01:06:49,694
I want to... I want to sleep
with you, Gertie.

1052
01:06:51,807 --> 01:06:53,570
- Come on.
- No, no.

1053
01:07:02,351 --> 01:07:04,717
Where did you get that shit?

1054
01:07:04,787 --> 01:07:06,448
My brother.

1055
01:07:48,097 --> 01:07:51,328
That is some good weed
that your brother has.

1056
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:53,595
Where does he get it at?

1057
01:07:53,669 --> 01:07:56,399
I don't know.
He won't tell me.

1058
01:07:56,472 --> 01:07:59,066
That sucks, your brother
won't tell you about it.

1059
01:07:59,141 --> 01:08:01,507
'Cause it's kinda whacked.

1060
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:04,909
If I knew where to get this,
I would get this every day.

1061
01:08:12,755 --> 01:08:13,983
Yo, Ham...

1062
01:08:15,624 --> 01:08:17,387
Pussy.

1063
01:08:17,460 --> 01:08:20,258
You takin' big hits
for a little guy.

1064
01:08:20,329 --> 01:08:21,853
You're a fiend,
that's why.

1065
01:08:21,931 --> 01:08:25,662
And you got,
you got gold on your neck, too?

1066
01:08:25,734 --> 01:08:27,258
That's crazy.

1067
01:08:27,336 --> 01:08:29,634
That's nice.
Christ on your neck.

1068
01:08:29,705 --> 01:08:31,673
That's nice.
I like that.

1069
01:08:38,147 --> 01:08:41,480
- Jesus Christ.
- You believe in Him?

1070
01:08:41,550 --> 01:08:43,916
Yeah, I believe in Him.

1071
01:08:43,986 --> 01:08:46,181
That guy is the Saver, man.

1072
01:08:46,255 --> 01:08:48,018
He's cool.

1073
01:08:48,090 --> 01:08:49,387
Saved his life.

1074
01:08:53,429 --> 01:08:55,124
- What's up, Jeff?
- 'S up?

1075
01:08:55,865 --> 01:08:57,730
Chillin'.

1076
01:08:57,800 --> 01:09:00,997
My man fucked up right here.

1077
01:09:01,103 --> 01:09:02,695
Oh, shit.

1078
01:09:10,246 --> 01:09:12,510
Oh, shit.

1079
01:09:16,752 --> 01:09:21,587
That weed got you so fucked up
where you don't want to hit it?

1080
01:09:21,657 --> 01:09:23,625
- That shit got me open.
- Yeah.

1081
01:09:23,692 --> 01:09:26,058
- Like it?
- Yeah, dig it, y'all.

1082
01:09:26,128 --> 01:09:28,392
It feels different,
like you're in another world...

1083
01:09:28,464 --> 01:09:31,331
like you zone out.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1084
01:09:31,400 --> 01:09:32,594
You're straight man.

1085
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:35,136
You straight?

1086
01:09:35,204 --> 01:09:38,435
That's my limit.
You know what I'm sayin'?

1087
01:09:38,507 --> 01:09:39,940
The big hit man.

1088
01:09:40,009 --> 01:09:42,170
You know what I'm sayin'?
Big hit, baby.

1089
01:09:42,244 --> 01:09:44,769
Get high quick.
Big hits.

1090
01:09:44,847 --> 01:09:46,712
I see the cherry go big, yo.

1091
01:09:46,782 --> 01:09:47,908
Word?

1092
01:09:47,983 --> 01:09:51,111
Steam that shit.
Big hit man.

1093
01:09:51,187 --> 01:09:53,155
Big hit.

1094
01:09:53,222 --> 01:09:57,124
Well, see, a person like me
smoke weed until I hallucinate.

1095
01:09:57,193 --> 01:09:58,785
I don't know why, either.

1096
01:09:58,861 --> 01:10:00,988
Crazy, right?

1097
01:10:01,063 --> 01:10:04,726
This party was dope,
but that shit got played quick.

1098
01:10:04,800 --> 01:10:06,893
But the bitches
are freaky here.

1099
01:10:06,969 --> 01:10:11,702
¢Ü Casper, the friendly ghost,
the friendly ghost ¢Ü

1100
01:10:11,774 --> 01:10:14,436
¢Ü The dopest ghost in town. ¢Ü

1101
01:10:14,510 --> 01:10:18,708
¢Ü The bitches love me because
I'm fuckin' Casper ¢Ü

1102
01:10:18,781 --> 01:10:21,443
¢Ü The dopest ghost around. ¢Ü

1103
01:10:21,517 --> 01:10:23,314
Fuck, yeah.

1104
01:10:26,689 --> 01:10:29,453
I'm not gonna die.

1105
01:10:43,572 --> 01:10:45,005
Do you like kissin' me?

1106
01:10:45,074 --> 01:10:46,405
Yes.

1107
01:10:46,475 --> 01:10:50,070
- Do you like me?
- U h-huh.

1108
01:10:50,145 --> 01:10:52,807
I think you're like the best girl
I've ever kissed.

1109
01:11:00,322 --> 01:11:02,790
(sobbing)

1110
01:11:07,830 --> 01:11:10,230
I couldn't stop thinking
about you

1111
01:11:10,299 --> 01:11:12,460
ever since I seen you
at the block party.

1112
01:11:12,534 --> 01:11:14,058
Come on.

1113
01:11:14,136 --> 01:11:17,105
I'm serious.
I'm not jokin'.

1114
01:11:17,172 --> 01:11:19,265
I just like you. That's all.

1115
01:11:19,341 --> 01:11:21,241
I like you, too.

1116
01:11:59,548 --> 01:12:01,880
Hey, yo, Steven.

1117
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:03,918
Come on, man.
Steven!

1118
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:05,419
What, man?

1119
01:12:05,487 --> 01:12:08,354
Let me in your parents' room.
J ust for a while.

1120
01:12:08,424 --> 01:12:09,584
No, I can't, man.

1121
01:12:09,658 --> 01:12:11,683
Come on, man.
Hook me up.

1122
01:12:11,760 --> 01:12:14,160
Do me this solid.

1123
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:17,164
Come on, man.
Yo, I gotta get Darcy alone, man.

1124
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:19,894
She's gonna let me fuck her.

1125
01:12:19,968 --> 01:12:23,335
All right, man. J ust don't fuck
with anything, all right?

1126
01:12:23,405 --> 01:12:24,337
All right.

1127
01:13:13,922 --> 01:13:16,049
Telly, I'm nervous.

1128
01:13:17,259 --> 01:13:20,228
Trust me.
Don't be nervous.

1129
01:14:43,879 --> 01:14:45,312
Sorry.

1130
01:15:09,838 --> 01:15:12,671
I like you so much.

1131
01:15:12,741 --> 01:15:15,710
I think you're beautiful.

1132
01:15:15,777 --> 01:15:18,268
If we fucked,
you would love it.

1133
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:20,815
You wouldn't believe it.

1134
01:15:20,883 --> 01:15:22,680
How do you know?

1135
01:15:25,654 --> 01:15:28,555
I just know.
You'll love it.

1136
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:32,553
But I'm scared, Telly.

1137
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:37,498
I'm tellin' you, there's nothin'
in the world to worry about.

1138
01:15:37,566 --> 01:15:39,295
Nothing?

1139
01:15:51,313 --> 01:15:52,541
Nothing.

1140
01:15:54,116 --> 01:15:57,415
I just want to make you
happy, that's all.

1141
01:15:57,486 --> 01:15:59,818
Trust me.

1142
01:16:00,322 --> 01:16:03,689
I don't want you to hurt me.

1143
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:05,954
You know it won't hurt.

1144
01:16:06,028 --> 01:16:07,962
I'll be gentle, I promise.

1145
01:16:09,731 --> 01:16:12,894
Do you care about me?

1146
01:16:12,968 --> 01:16:15,232
Of course I do.

1147
01:16:23,779 --> 01:16:26,339
¢Ü The friendly ghost ¢Ü

1148
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:30,408
¢Ü You know
I'm the dopest ghost in town. ¢Ü

1149
01:16:30,485 --> 01:16:35,752
¢Ü The bitches all love me
'cause I'm fuckin' Casper. ¢Ü

1150
01:16:35,824 --> 01:16:37,951
Fuckin' shit.

1151
01:16:38,026 --> 01:16:40,221
Casper.

1152
01:16:40,295 --> 01:16:41,728
What's up, Jenny?

1153
01:16:41,797 --> 01:16:44,425
What are you doin' here?
Long time no see.

1154
01:16:44,499 --> 01:16:45,693
Casper, where's Telly?

1155
01:16:45,767 --> 01:16:47,735
What do you want
with Telly for?

1156
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:50,237
That guy's got
enough bitches.

1157
01:16:50,305 --> 01:16:51,772
Where is he?

1158
01:16:53,408 --> 01:16:55,899
Well, don't look for him.
He's doin' fine.

1159
01:16:55,978 --> 01:16:57,673
He got a girl.

1160
01:16:59,247 --> 01:17:01,943
He's fucking her right now
in Steven's parents' room.

1161
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:03,449
(laughing)

1162
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:06,079
So what you know, Joe?

1163
01:17:10,659 --> 01:17:13,492
What's she lookin' worried
about that nigga for, huh?

1164
01:17:14,863 --> 01:17:18,560
Oh, Ham.
Hit this yo. Ham.

1165
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:31,044
Telly, it hurts.

1166
01:17:32,914 --> 01:17:34,779
That's it.
You're doin' fine.

1167
01:17:34,850 --> 01:17:37,011
Come on.
Come on. That's it.

1168
01:17:41,423 --> 01:17:44,119
(moaning in pain)

1169
01:17:47,295 --> 01:17:49,388
That's it.
You're doin' fine.

1170
01:17:49,464 --> 01:17:52,331
Come on, Darcy.
That's it.

1171
01:18:04,746 --> 01:18:06,907
Telly, it hurts.
Ow.

1172
01:18:06,982 --> 01:18:09,576
Come on, Darcy.
That's it. Come on.

1173
01:18:12,421 --> 01:18:14,446
Shut the fuckin' door!

1174
01:19:13,849 --> 01:19:15,908
(glass shatters)

1175
01:19:24,192 --> 01:19:25,784
What's up, Ham?

1176
01:19:28,897 --> 01:19:31,127
(laughing)

1177
01:20:19,414 --> 01:20:21,382
(coughing)

1178
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:35,462
Lucky fuckin' bastard.

1179
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:42,761
Hey, Jenny, wake up.

1180
01:21:46,268 --> 01:21:48,099
Hey, Jenny, wake up.

1181
01:22:06,254 --> 01:22:07,983
Jenny, wake up.

1182
01:23:43,084 --> 01:23:45,052
Don't worry, Jenny.
It's me, Casper.

1183
01:23:46,221 --> 01:23:48,052
Don't worry, Jenny.

1184
01:23:59,334 --> 01:24:00,460
Jenny: No.

1185
01:24:00,568 --> 01:24:02,468
Shh. Shh.

1186
01:24:12,881 --> 01:24:14,212
Shh.

1187
01:24:23,591 --> 01:24:26,287
It's me, Casper.
Don't worry.

1188
01:25:42,737 --> 01:25:44,364
Shh...

1189
01:25:46,641 --> 01:25:48,040
Don't.

1190
01:27:56,771 --> 01:27:59,001
Telly: When you're young,
not much matters.

1191
01:27:59,073 --> 01:28:01,200
When you find something
that you care about,

1192
01:28:01,309 --> 01:28:03,140
then that's all you got.

1193
01:28:03,177 --> 01:28:06,374
When you go to sleep at night,
you dream of pussy.

1194
01:28:06,447 --> 01:28:08,642
When you wake up,
it's the same thing.

1195
01:28:08,716 --> 01:28:11,913
It's there in your face.
You can't escape it.

1196
01:28:11,986 --> 01:28:13,510
Sometimes when you're young,

1197
01:28:13,588 --> 01:28:15,522
the only place to go is inside.

1198
01:28:15,590 --> 01:28:18,650
That's just it.
Fuckin' is what I love.

1199
01:28:18,726 --> 01:28:21,593
That that away from me
and I really got nothin'.

1200
01:28:29,070 --> 01:28:31,163
Jesus Christ,
what happened?
