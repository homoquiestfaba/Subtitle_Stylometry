00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:05,130
[Vincent] Thinking back
over the last year, I realize,

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:08,927
the moment I met Roma
is when it all started
to change.

3
00:00:15,015 --> 00:00:16,015
Un...

4
00:00:16,809 --> 00:00:17,809
Deux...

5
00:00:19,478 --> 00:00:20,478
Troi...

6
00:00:21,313 --> 00:00:22,313
Quatre...

7
00:00:23,315 --> 00:00:24,315
Cinq...

8
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:26,109
Six...

9
00:00:26,986 --> 00:00:27,986
Sept...

10
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:29,780
Huit...

11
00:00:30,406 --> 00:00:31,406
Neuf...

12
00:00:31,908 --> 00:00:32,908
Dix.

13
00:00:39,164 --> 00:00:40,291
This is me.

14
00:00:40,875 --> 00:00:46,088
1988, three years old,
before things got complicated.

15
00:00:48,007 --> 00:00:49,926
This is my best friend Steve.

16
00:00:50,885 --> 00:00:52,511
We still have sleepovers.

17
00:00:53,596 --> 00:00:54,806
These are my parents.

18
00:00:55,890 --> 00:00:57,642
I was the ring bearer
at their wedding,

19
00:00:57,725 --> 00:01:00,311
which I guess
makes me a bastard.

20
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,608
For so long they were...
so in love.

21
00:01:06,191 --> 00:01:08,945
It was just their friends
and me.

22
00:01:09,612 --> 00:01:13,658
Eventually, a little sister
and... it was perfect.

23
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:16,160
And then, I don't know,

24
00:01:16,535 --> 00:01:21,081
life, time, age, bills, routine,

25
00:01:22,207 --> 00:01:25,044
I guess life always finds
a way to complicate itself,

26
00:01:25,127 --> 00:01:26,127
if you let it.

27
00:01:27,463 --> 00:01:28,589
And it did.

28
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:31,717
One house turned into two...

29
00:01:33,302 --> 00:01:35,638
And that's when I became
a latchkey kid.

30
00:01:36,806 --> 00:01:39,976
Just always had a key
and a shoelace
around my neck.

31
00:01:41,769 --> 00:01:43,521
My mom thought
that if I had my own key,

32
00:01:43,604 --> 00:01:45,064
I would feel
more like a grown up,

33
00:01:45,147 --> 00:01:47,775
but I don't know if I ever did.

34
00:01:50,402 --> 00:01:51,863
[heavy breathing]

35
00:01:56,034 --> 00:01:57,660
[female moaning]

36
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:07,419
[female panting]

37
00:02:33,738 --> 00:02:34,738
[moans]

38
00:02:45,041 --> 00:02:46,542
[Roma]
How are we going to do this?

39
00:02:48,711 --> 00:02:51,005
[Vincent]
I think we have to tell
Steve today.

40
00:03:35,925 --> 00:03:38,302
[screaming]
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

41
00:04:18,592 --> 00:04:21,095
[phone vibrating]

42
00:04:22,554 --> 00:04:23,597
[message ring tone]

43
00:04:24,723 --> 00:04:27,518
[dial tone]

44
00:04:39,279 --> 00:04:40,799
[Steve's voice]
Hey, guys,
you've reached Steve.

45
00:04:40,823 --> 00:04:42,992
I'm out of town
and away from the phone
this weekend,

46
00:04:43,075 --> 00:04:45,661
but can check
on my messages
so leave one.

47
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:47,412
[beeps]

48
00:04:47,538 --> 00:04:50,499
[Vincent]
Steve-O, what up. It's me, man.

49
00:04:51,375 --> 00:04:53,502
Um. Hope you got back
in town all right?

50
00:04:53,585 --> 00:04:56,380
You're probably at work
now, um...

51
00:04:58,007 --> 00:05:00,009
Listen, I want to talk to you
about something.

52
00:05:00,425 --> 00:05:05,223
So, let's meet at St. Nick's
tonight, seven?

53
00:05:06,057 --> 00:05:07,307
Call you later, dude, peace.

54
00:05:27,369 --> 00:05:28,412
[Vincent] Directly at me.

55
00:05:32,208 --> 00:05:33,251
Can we focus, please?

56
00:05:34,085 --> 00:05:35,253
That hurt... that hurt you?

57
00:05:35,335 --> 00:05:37,231
- [Vincent] You went straight...
- I know. It was kind of hard.

58
00:05:37,255 --> 00:05:38,463
[Vincent]
Yeah, that one hurt.

59
00:05:38,547 --> 00:05:40,567
Look, no, but seriously,
we have to focus
for a second, okay?

60
00:05:40,591 --> 00:05:42,152
'cause this is really...
this is important.

61
00:05:42,176 --> 00:05:44,238
What we do can affect
the temperature
of the whole place,

62
00:05:44,262 --> 00:05:46,364
all these people are
counting on us.
They need to know...

63
00:05:46,388 --> 00:05:47,782
Okay, all the people
are counting on us.

64
00:05:47,806 --> 00:05:49,006
All of them.
They need to know.

65
00:05:49,058 --> 00:05:51,659
So like, what order,
we're figuring out,
there's a science to this.

66
00:05:51,685 --> 00:05:52,561
[beeps]

67
00:05:52,644 --> 00:05:53,644
Whoa, whoa...

68
00:05:53,687 --> 00:05:55,231
You can't just go
pressing it, either.

69
00:05:55,314 --> 00:05:57,608
Let's make sure
we're on the same page here,

70
00:05:57,775 --> 00:05:58,650
you know what I mean?

71
00:05:58,734 --> 00:05:59,944
- Okay.
- Okay, good.

72
00:06:00,069 --> 00:06:01,570
Look at these album covers
right here.

73
00:06:01,653 --> 00:06:04,031
Simon & Garfunkel,
this dude's directly behind him.

74
00:06:04,115 --> 00:06:05,490
- And he's like...
- Seriously.

75
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:08,095
-He's like eating...
-It's like, if I were standing
in front of you...

76
00:06:08,119 --> 00:06:11,289
Cougar, that's a strange
position to be in,
for a cover.

77
00:06:11,371 --> 00:06:13,457
But that's fine,
we'll give that one to him.

78
00:06:14,083 --> 00:06:16,043
Let's see.
That is perfect.

79
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:17,962
This is like...

80
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:19,504
- You kind of look like him.
- Yeah?

81
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:20,839
You know Joe Cocker?

82
00:06:20,923 --> 00:06:24,426
Yes, of course, he's the only
one to cover a Beatles song

83
00:06:24,509 --> 00:06:25,552
and do it better.

84
00:06:25,844 --> 00:06:27,525
And, you know,
some things you don't touch.

85
00:06:27,554 --> 00:06:29,473
Some things are just off limits,

86
00:06:29,556 --> 00:06:32,310
but he went there
and he did it to perfection.

87
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,354
He did it better. Mmm-hmm.

88
00:06:35,437 --> 00:06:37,731
I'm impressed, I'm impressed.
I just want to say that.

89
00:06:37,815 --> 00:06:40,109
- [beeps]
- No. You just pressed it.

90
00:06:40,651 --> 00:06:42,778
We didn't even have
a dialog about it.

91
00:06:42,861 --> 00:06:44,029
- Ooo...
- Now you're...

92
00:06:44,196 --> 00:06:46,157
["Notre bloc"
by Les Fées de Paris playing]

93
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,641
[Roma giggling]

94
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:54,933
Whoo! [laughing]

95
00:07:55,767 --> 00:07:57,353
[giggling] Hey, baby.

96
00:07:58,770 --> 00:07:59,813
[both kissing]

97
00:07:59,897 --> 00:08:01,481
- [Steve] Whoo!
- [Roma giggling]

98
00:08:01,565 --> 00:08:02,900
So beautiful.

99
00:08:05,152 --> 00:08:06,320
[Steve laughs maniacally]

100
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:09,257
[Steve]
Getting wild tonight, boy?

101
00:08:09,281 --> 00:08:10,408
Yeah, milady.

102
00:08:13,618 --> 00:08:15,138
[Roma] Slow down!
Slow down! [chuckles]

103
00:08:18,082 --> 00:08:20,334
- Come here. Threesome.
- Hey, man.

104
00:08:20,418 --> 00:08:22,294
- [Roma] No...
- Whoo!

105
00:08:23,921 --> 00:08:25,089
Where's my drink?

106
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:26,547
It's right there.

107
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:27,590
Yeah!

108
00:08:29,260 --> 00:08:30,302
I missed you.

109
00:08:30,386 --> 00:08:31,429
[Steve]
I missed you!

110
00:09:03,127 --> 00:09:05,170
Excusez moi, excusez moi.

111
00:09:05,254 --> 00:09:06,422
Sorry, I don't speak it.

112
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:09,925
No, pardon, uh,
I'm looking for...

113
00:09:10,342 --> 00:09:11,469
Coeur esprit.

114
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:15,055
- Yeah, I don't...
- Yes, uh, no.

115
00:09:15,431 --> 00:09:17,682
Melrose Avenue,
Hearts and Spirits.

116
00:09:17,766 --> 00:09:20,102
Melrose, yeah.
If you just keep
on going that way

117
00:09:20,685 --> 00:09:22,729
and then you make a right,
and then another left

118
00:09:22,813 --> 00:09:24,273
and you'll find it.

119
00:09:24,648 --> 00:09:26,733
-Okay?
-Okay, yeah.
And can I feet?

120
00:09:28,152 --> 00:09:29,194
Can you what?

121
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,446
Can I feet?

122
00:09:32,364 --> 00:09:33,573
Yeah, see, I'm not...

123
00:09:33,698 --> 00:09:38,787
I'm joking. Can I walk there,
with my foot, by feet? [giggles]

124
00:09:39,288 --> 00:09:40,288
With your foot by feet.

125
00:09:40,331 --> 00:09:41,331
Yeah.

126
00:09:42,624 --> 00:09:43,792
Come on, I'll feet you.

127
00:09:43,875 --> 00:09:44,751
Yeah?

128
00:09:44,835 --> 00:09:45,835
I'll... yeah.

129
00:09:46,170 --> 00:09:47,796
Nice, thank you.

130
00:09:54,761 --> 00:09:56,054
These maps.

131
00:09:56,721 --> 00:09:58,349
It's a big city, LA, huh?

132
00:09:59,391 --> 00:10:00,892
I like the weather here.

133
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,356
I mean, it's pretty smoggy here.

134
00:10:05,981 --> 00:10:06,981
Huh?

135
00:10:07,399 --> 00:10:10,319
Smoggy, like,
[imitating choking]
you know?

136
00:10:10,402 --> 00:10:12,196
- Don't do that. Yeah.
- Can't breathe.

137
00:10:19,786 --> 00:10:20,786
Hmm.

138
00:10:21,205 --> 00:10:23,832
Do you know, um...
Do you know a joke?

139
00:10:26,293 --> 00:10:28,920
Joke? No. I'm not
really funny, you know?

140
00:10:29,671 --> 00:10:34,092
Well, I have one joke.
Want to hear my joke? Okay.

141
00:10:34,176 --> 00:10:35,176
It's...

142
00:10:35,719 --> 00:10:40,015
A couple in bed,
they wake up,
it's in the morning,

143
00:10:40,182 --> 00:10:42,767
the man, he wants to have sex,
he's like...
[imitating kissing]

144
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:45,687
And the girl is like,
"Oh, no, I cannot today

145
00:10:45,770 --> 00:10:49,024
'cause I'm seeing the lady
doctor, the genecologist."

146
00:10:49,483 --> 00:10:50,817
The gynecologist, yeah?

147
00:10:50,901 --> 00:10:52,986
Yeah, genecologist and...

148
00:10:53,571 --> 00:10:56,490
And she said I don't want,
you know, her to see...

149
00:10:56,781 --> 00:10:58,158
It's disgusting.

150
00:10:58,617 --> 00:11:01,036
So, the man is sad, 'cause he
really want to have sex.

151
00:11:01,953 --> 00:11:06,250
And then he said to her,
"Yes, but are you seeing
the dentist today?"

152
00:11:09,711 --> 00:11:11,338
- That's funny.
- That's funny.

153
00:11:11,755 --> 00:11:12,964
[Vincent]
You got a boyfriend?

154
00:11:13,131 --> 00:11:14,341
[Josephine] Yes, I do.

155
00:11:14,466 --> 00:11:16,468
We've been together,
like, two years,

156
00:11:17,553 --> 00:11:19,888
and, uh, yeah.

157
00:11:19,971 --> 00:11:20,971
You love him?

158
00:11:21,223 --> 00:11:22,823
- Of course, I do. Yes.
- [phone ringing]

159
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:24,560
He's perfect, you know.

160
00:11:24,643 --> 00:11:26,895
I mean, you know, for me.

161
00:11:27,854 --> 00:11:28,897
Anything.

162
00:11:29,231 --> 00:11:30,732
Hey, I'm sorry, I just gotta...

163
00:11:31,525 --> 00:11:32,526
Sure.

164
00:11:32,610 --> 00:11:33,610
Hello?

165
00:11:35,279 --> 00:11:36,321
Hey, Ma.

166
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:40,325
No, I'm kind of in the middle
of something right now.

167
00:11:43,203 --> 00:11:44,371
Cookies?

168
00:11:46,957 --> 00:11:48,959
I see you all the time,
you know.

169
00:11:51,462 --> 00:11:55,633
Yeah, okay. Bye.

170
00:12:00,011 --> 00:12:01,054
- Hey.
- Hey.

171
00:12:02,139 --> 00:12:03,848
I heard cookies.

172
00:12:04,308 --> 00:12:07,811
Yeah, my mom she wants me
to bring her cookies. Um...

173
00:12:08,145 --> 00:12:09,980
But look, Melrose
is just right over there.

174
00:12:10,063 --> 00:12:12,125
I'm sorry I have to run,
it was really nice meeting you.

175
00:12:12,149 --> 00:12:13,651
I would love to meet your mom.

176
00:12:14,067 --> 00:12:16,236
I'd love to eat cookies

187
00:12:48,352 --> 00:12:49,269

192
00:12:58,195 --> 00:12:59,446
[laughing]

193
00:12:59,530 --> 00:13:00,548
You're just going to leave me?

194
00:13:00,572 --> 00:13:01,572
[Steve] Bye.

195
00:13:01,699 --> 00:13:04,951
That's cool.
Let's go get in the jacuzzi.

196
00:13:05,494 --> 00:13:08,372

197
00:13:08,497 --> 00:13:09,540
[female howling]

198
00:13:09,623 --> 00:13:10,957
[Vincent] Let's go.

00:13:25,180 --> 00:13:26,180
Love.

206
00:13:26,431 --> 00:13:27,431
Wristwatch?

207
00:13:27,516 --> 00:13:30,227
Time, time, love, time.

208
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:32,937
Love in the Time of Cholera!
[laughs] Got it!

209
00:13:35,023 --> 00:13:37,735
- She got cholera!
- That was unbelievable!

210
00:13:39,069 --> 00:13:42,531
You're absolutely...
They're cheating!
That was cheating!

211
00:13:42,656 --> 00:13:44,057
We'll show you
how it's really done.

212
00:13:44,115 --> 00:13:46,093
-[Roma] Oh, really?
I'm going to show you
-how it's really done.

213
00:13:46,117 --> 00:13:46,993
That's what you're gonna do?

214
00:13:47,077 --> 00:13:48,471
I'm absolutely gonna show
you how it's done.

215
00:13:48,495 --> 00:13:49,597
You're gonna show
us how it's done?

216
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,790
- Absolutely, positively.
- How are you gonna do that?

217
00:13:51,873 --> 00:13:53,833
-Show me, baby.
-I'll show you all day,
baby girl.

218
00:13:53,917 --> 00:13:55,753
I'mma show you all day.

219
00:13:56,587 --> 00:13:58,422
[Steve]
Game time. Let's get it.

220
00:14:00,048 --> 00:14:03,009
Uh... A pirate? Maybe pirate?

221
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:04,386
It's a movie.

222
00:14:04,469 --> 00:14:05,550
[Steve]
Addict, drug addict.

223
00:14:05,596 --> 00:14:07,431
Heroin, heroin! Addict!

224
00:14:07,972 --> 00:14:09,474
Heroin junkie!
Yes, heroin junkie!

225
00:14:09,558 --> 00:14:11,411
What game are you playing,
do you know how this works?

226
00:14:11,435 --> 00:14:13,413
- [Steve] Stay sharp, baby.
- Yea, baby. Stay sharp.

227
00:14:13,437 --> 00:14:15,773
What, what, what...
Let's get this.

228
00:14:15,855 --> 00:14:17,649
What the "H" is that?

229
00:14:17,733 --> 00:14:22,487
Okay, sounds like, movie,
syl-la-ble.

230
00:14:22,571 --> 00:14:24,448
Do you know how to fucking draw
a straight line

231
00:14:24,531 --> 00:14:26,366
or are you some retarded
kindergartener?

232
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,911
Jessica, I be learning still.

233
00:14:30,829 --> 00:14:33,248
Please don't be mad,
we be friends.

234
00:14:34,040 --> 00:14:36,918
And just like a side-note,
people, I think this
should be said,

235
00:14:37,001 --> 00:14:39,921
but, like, it's charades,
so no one should be talking.

236
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:42,966
You know, like don't use your
words kind of thing, right.

237
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,926
Time for the 'cuzz.

238
00:14:45,009 --> 00:14:46,219
- Whoo!
- Woo-hoo!

239
00:14:46,303 --> 00:14:47,846
I wanna go in the 'cuzz.

240
00:14:50,265 --> 00:14:52,810
[Roma]
Oh, yes, girl,
drink it up. Mmm-hmm.

241
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:55,813
I feel you, I really do.

242
00:14:55,895 --> 00:14:58,565
- What? Oh, my God!
- Whoa-ho-hoo!

243
00:14:58,649 --> 00:15:00,317
She just put that bottle to bed.

244
00:15:00,400 --> 00:15:01,943
That's sexy, babe, I like that.

245
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,069
Thank you.

246
00:15:03,153 --> 00:15:04,154
You're welcome.

247
00:15:05,656 --> 00:15:06,698
Mamacita.

248
00:15:06,865 --> 00:15:07,866
[Roma]
Yeah, baby.

249
00:15:08,241 --> 00:15:09,660
Tiger time.

250
00:15:09,951 --> 00:15:13,079
Oh, I love it when you wear
those googles on your head.

251
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,706
- Rawr! Rawr!
- Rawr!

252
00:15:14,956 --> 00:15:16,458
[Vincent]
We're going to go, too.

253
00:15:35,352 --> 00:15:36,520
[Roma] You guys coming?

254
00:15:37,354 --> 00:15:38,480
Maybe in a bit.

255
00:15:38,689 --> 00:15:40,649
Aye! You little fuckers.

256
00:15:40,732 --> 00:15:42,053
- They're gonna have sex!
- Do it!

257
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:45,987
Yeah, we'll see you in five,
you fuckin' fuckers.

258
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:47,113
[Roma giggling] Hurry up.

259
00:15:47,656 --> 00:15:48,824
We'll be out there.

260
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,868
- [Roma] Yeah!
- [Steve] Whoo!

261
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,328
'Cuzzi, 'cuzzi, 'cuzzi.

262
00:15:53,787 --> 00:15:57,374
'Cuzzi, cuzzi, cuzzi, cuzzi.

263
00:15:59,167 --> 00:16:00,167
Babe?

264
00:16:01,294 --> 00:16:02,379
What is that?

265
00:16:02,921 --> 00:16:03,922
What?

266
00:16:04,422 --> 00:16:05,423
That.

267
00:16:06,758 --> 00:16:08,719
No. Please don't do that.

268
00:16:09,803 --> 00:16:11,221
What, why are you acting
like this?

269
00:16:11,304 --> 00:16:12,347
Vince.

270
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:13,473
Yes?

271
00:16:18,937 --> 00:16:20,313
What? What is it?

272
00:16:21,815 --> 00:16:23,525
[sighs] You know what.

273
00:16:25,402 --> 00:16:28,196
Yeah, I wanted to go
in the jacuzzi,
but it's cool.

274
00:16:29,197 --> 00:16:31,282
You're in love with her,
it's obvious.

275
00:16:32,576 --> 00:16:33,493
What?

276
00:16:33,577 --> 00:16:35,995
It is. And it's embarrassing.

277
00:16:37,455 --> 00:16:39,249
You used to be
so in love with me.

278
00:16:39,958 --> 00:16:41,877
I don't know,
maybe somewhere you still are,

279
00:16:41,960 --> 00:16:43,962
but what am I supposed
to do with this?

280
00:16:47,883 --> 00:16:50,552
- Come on.
- No, don't. Tell me!

281
00:16:50,719 --> 00:16:52,679
What do you want me
to do with this?

282
00:16:59,352 --> 00:17:00,938
You have nothing to say.

283
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,356
[sighs]

284
00:17:05,066 --> 00:17:06,944
You know everyone loves you,

285
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:09,195
but really deep down,

286
00:17:09,905 --> 00:17:11,489
you're an asshole

287
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:13,491
and it sucks.

288
00:17:52,906 --> 00:17:53,907
You want gum?

289
00:17:53,991 --> 00:17:54,991
No, thanks.

290
00:17:55,241 --> 00:17:56,785
Cookies, cookies.
[giggles]

291
00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,663
Cookie monster.

292
00:18:02,373 --> 00:18:05,710
Hey, no way,
what did you just do?

293
00:18:05,794 --> 00:18:06,794
What?

294
00:18:06,920 --> 00:18:09,172
You just put
the papers in the street.

295
00:18:10,548 --> 00:18:12,509
Oh. Why would you do that?

296
00:18:14,427 --> 00:18:15,553
You should not.

297
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:17,639
Yeah, you're right, I just...

298
00:18:17,806 --> 00:18:19,349
You should care, you live in LA.

299
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:20,308
I do care.

300
00:18:20,391 --> 00:18:22,060
This is the planet.
No, you don't.

301
00:18:22,143 --> 00:18:23,743
- I care about the planet.
- You do that.

302
00:18:23,812 --> 00:18:25,605
Of course I care
about the planet,
I'm sorry.

303
00:18:25,689 --> 00:18:28,274
You know that when
the planet is mad,
it's really bad.

304
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:31,402
Really bad.
Should not do that.

305
00:18:33,697 --> 00:18:34,990
You want me to go get it?

306
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:40,495
No, for real, do you want me
to go back and get it or no?

307
00:18:41,788 --> 00:18:43,665
Once it's done,
it's done, come on.

308
00:18:43,748 --> 00:18:47,044
You cannot go back
when you trash the world
like this.

309
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:51,798
But, I'll make you
think about
it on the way back.

310
00:18:54,634 --> 00:18:55,802
[phone beeps]

311
00:18:58,722 --> 00:18:59,973
Who's that? Roma?

312
00:19:01,391 --> 00:19:02,392
Hmm.

313
00:19:06,270 --> 00:19:07,313
[Steve]
Dude, you gotta...

314
00:19:07,438 --> 00:19:09,273
You gotta stop it, man,
for real, all right?

315
00:19:09,357 --> 00:19:11,359
-Can't stop, won't stop, baby.
Stay sharp.
-Okay.

316
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:13,904
Dude, we got to get you
out of this shit, you up?

317
00:19:14,821 --> 00:19:16,489
What? Wake the fuck up!
Stay sharp.

318
00:19:16,573 --> 00:19:18,282
I'm up, man, I'm fucking sharp.

319
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,200
Man, you ain't sharp,

320
00:19:19,283 --> 00:19:21,411
you as dull as an
old man's dick
reading Dostoevsky.

321
00:19:21,494 --> 00:19:23,538
Okay, this is not helping
the situation, all right?

322
00:19:23,621 --> 00:19:25,040
Stop! For real man,
what the fuck?

323
00:19:25,123 --> 00:19:27,250
You tell me, brother.
You tell me what the fuck is up.

324
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,418
[Vincent groans]

325
00:19:28,501 --> 00:19:30,921
Fuck! That one kind of hurt,
all right?

326
00:19:31,004 --> 00:19:33,715
That's good, that's good.
I want them all
to fucking hurt, man.

327
00:19:33,798 --> 00:19:34,966
That means you're alive.

328
00:19:35,050 --> 00:19:38,136
How's that feeling?
That's what feelings is.

329
00:19:38,219 --> 00:19:39,679
- Okay.
- Come on, man.

330
00:19:40,430 --> 00:19:41,430
[Vincent] Thank you.

331
00:19:41,848 --> 00:19:42,724
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

332
00:19:42,807 --> 00:19:45,435
Enough! All right?
That's fucking enough.

333
00:19:45,518 --> 00:19:47,771
Smile bigger, smile bigger.
Uh...

334
00:19:47,938 --> 00:19:49,331
Smile bigger
or else the pile driver's
coming.

335
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:50,416
Do you want the pile driver?

336
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:51,733
I do not want the pile drivers.

337
00:19:52,442 --> 00:19:53,651
[Steve]
Come on, come on.

338
00:19:54,402 --> 00:19:56,947
- What?
- Fuck her, fuck her.

339
00:19:57,739 --> 00:20:00,241
Jess is, listen, man,
real talk, real talk.

340
00:20:00,909 --> 00:20:02,452
Put out those positive vibes,

341
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:05,080
and the world's going
to reciprocate ten-fold,

342
00:20:05,163 --> 00:20:06,497
I promise you, man.

343
00:20:06,957 --> 00:20:08,499
You'll find your sweetheart.

344
00:20:08,708 --> 00:20:10,627
[police siren wailing]

345
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:19,468
Boom! [laughs]

346
00:20:19,844 --> 00:20:21,763
Do it again,
do it fucking again.

347
00:20:21,846 --> 00:20:24,474
-Stay sharp, baby!
Stay fucking sharp!
-Yeah, baby!

348
00:20:24,599 --> 00:20:26,810

00:20:28,227 --> 00:20:30,188
Yeah! That's what
I'm fucking talking about, dude.

350
00:20:30,396 --> 00:20:31,481
Woo-hoo-hoo!

351
00:20:32,315 --> 00:20:33,566
Get the fuck off.

[Roma's voice]
How are we going to do this?

353
00:21:35,045 --> 00:21:36,587
I think you're good
to drive home.

354
00:21:38,464 --> 00:21:40,633
No, baby, we're shacking up

Nee-Noo.

366
00:22:17,879 --> 00:22:21,507
Seriously, man, we gotta
get you out of this state,
man, you gotta clean up.

367
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:24,552
God, is this what
I think this is?

368
00:22:24,635 --> 00:22:26,137
Yep, Jess's toothbrush.

369
00:22:26,221 --> 00:22:27,221
Nope.

370
00:22:27,764 --> 00:22:28,765
- Why would you?
- Nope.

371
00:22:28,973 --> 00:22:30,808
And is this, is this...

372
00:22:31,893 --> 00:22:33,561
- Nope.
- Those are her bobby pins.

373
00:22:33,937 --> 00:22:35,105
Absolutely not.

374
00:22:35,563 --> 00:22:36,683
She used to have bobby pins,

375
00:22:36,731 --> 00:22:38,942
but thanks for helping me
clean up, I appreciate that.

376
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:41,319
The truth is, I think,
what I think the solution is,

377
00:22:41,402 --> 00:22:44,114
I think you just need to
bang a chick.

378
00:22:45,323 --> 00:22:47,242
Whoa. That felt aggressive.

379
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:50,578
When did the words for sex
just get so violent?

380
00:22:51,621 --> 00:22:53,039
I smashed her softly.

381
00:22:53,123 --> 00:22:55,875
Uh... I read
those cheeks, gently.

382
00:22:56,042 --> 00:22:58,461
I laid that pipe,
constructively.

383
00:22:58,586 --> 00:23:01,131
You say it is like
a god damn construction site.

384
00:23:01,339 --> 00:23:02,673
I raided her with my cock!

385
00:23:02,757 --> 00:23:05,635
I ram-shackled her...
to the bed.

386
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:09,889
It's definitely...
it's definitely
a conquering situation.

387
00:23:09,973 --> 00:23:12,433
It's kind of like Genghis Khan
to the rescue.

388
00:23:12,516 --> 00:23:14,602
Sex, we're going to have sex.

389
00:23:15,103 --> 00:23:18,356
Yeah, except when
you're in love
though, baby. Mmm...

390
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:21,692
No, definitely when you're
in love. Kinda, like, specially
when you're in love.

391
00:23:21,776 --> 00:23:25,655
-No, no, see,
when you're in love...
-We're in love.

392
00:23:26,405 --> 00:23:28,950
When you're in love,
it's just... it's different.

393
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,411
You know, I mean,
there's energy
and there's vigor.

394
00:23:32,536 --> 00:23:36,958
But it's, um...
How do I put it?
It's like a conversation.

395
00:23:37,041 --> 00:23:39,919
You know what I mean?
It's intense!

396
00:23:41,712 --> 00:23:43,190
Like me, I'm definitely
destroying her,

397
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:44,942
You know what I mean?
That's definitely
what's happening.

398
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:49,262
But it's just, like,
I'm destroying her in...
in the best of ways,

399
00:23:49,346 --> 00:23:50,867
you know what I mean?
It's just like...

400
00:23:51,306 --> 00:23:54,392
I'm just truthfully
and righteously

401
00:23:54,475 --> 00:23:56,477
and honorably,

402
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:58,355
destroying her.

403
00:23:58,938 --> 00:24:01,482
In... just the best ways.

404
00:24:02,566 --> 00:24:05,028
With chivalry, I mean,
does that make sense?

405
00:24:07,030 --> 00:24:10,158
Did you really bring that over
to my house to sleep tonight?

406
00:24:10,491 --> 00:24:11,409
Yeah.

407
00:24:11,492 --> 00:24:13,012
You carry that with you
wherever you go?

408
00:24:13,036 --> 00:24:16,414
Every night, baby.
You know, if I miss
one night of this guy,

409
00:24:17,332 --> 00:24:18,958
that's what happens
to my teeth. Whee!

410
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:20,918
No, can't get out of the rhythm.

411
00:24:21,252 --> 00:24:22,420
Sleep time!

412
00:24:43,900 --> 00:24:46,069
- Hi, Ma.
- Look at you.

413
00:24:46,569 --> 00:24:48,363
My baby's such a handsome man.

414
00:24:49,655 --> 00:24:51,991
I just wish you didn't look
so much like him.

415
00:24:53,034 --> 00:24:54,077
Come on in.

416
00:24:59,498 --> 00:25:01,418
Um... What happened?

417
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,602
I don't want to
talk about it,
okay?

418
00:25:02,626 --> 00:25:04,295
- So?
- I just...

419
00:25:04,379 --> 00:25:06,505
No, I said what happened?

420
00:25:06,589 --> 00:25:07,924
- Can I get...
- No, just go on.

421
00:25:08,007 --> 00:25:09,443
Are you going to let me talk?
Or you just...

422
00:25:09,467 --> 00:25:10,301
You always do this!

423
00:25:10,385 --> 00:25:13,346
Okay, you get these girls
to like you and then you
go down this road and...

424
00:25:13,721 --> 00:25:15,098
Okay, I like Jess.

425
00:25:15,514 --> 00:25:16,766
I mean I wish I had that.

426
00:25:16,849 --> 00:25:19,643
You better get your
own life together before
you get yourself a man.

427
00:25:19,894 --> 00:25:22,188
Talking about
"you wish you had that."

428
00:25:22,272 --> 00:25:23,272
You look good.

429
00:25:23,856 --> 00:25:24,941
I've been working out,

430
00:25:25,024 --> 00:25:27,151
-I've been doing burpees.
Okay, watch.
-Yeah?

431
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:28,778
Whoa!

432
00:25:28,861 --> 00:25:31,239
You gotta really
throw yourself
on the ground like that.

433
00:25:32,073 --> 00:25:33,991
Most guys don't even know
how to do it right.

434
00:25:34,075 --> 00:25:35,243
- [grunts]
- Right.

435
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:39,247
Tanny, please, not in the house.

436
00:25:39,705 --> 00:25:41,546
And Vincent, you going to
introduce your friend

437
00:25:41,624 --> 00:25:43,852
or are you just going to
let her stand
over there in the corner?

438
00:25:43,876 --> 00:25:45,916
-This is Josephine.
-[Tanny] Already
got someone new.

439
00:25:45,962 --> 00:25:47,546
Don't take this one long at all.

440
00:25:47,630 --> 00:25:48,672
Hello.

441
00:25:48,756 --> 00:25:49,799
[Vincent]
She's a friend.

442
00:25:49,924 --> 00:25:51,175
- [Ma] Uh-huh.
- [Tanny] Uh-huh.

443
00:25:51,259 --> 00:25:52,802
Come on, baby.
Come on in the kitchen.

444
00:25:53,428 --> 00:25:54,304
[Ma] What you got in the bag?

445
00:25:54,387 --> 00:25:55,221
Cookies.

446
00:25:55,305 --> 00:25:56,389
- Vincent.
- What?

447
00:25:56,473 --> 00:25:57,348
What happened?

448
00:25:57,432 --> 00:25:58,266
With what?

449
00:25:58,349 --> 00:25:59,725
With Jess, what happened?

450
00:26:00,643 --> 00:26:02,603
We broke up two months ago,
okay, Tanny?

451
00:26:02,686 --> 00:26:04,647
Okay, well, I just haven't
seen you in a while.

452
00:26:04,730 --> 00:26:06,524
Well, I guess that makes me
a bad brother.

453
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:07,984
Okay, I didn't say all that.

454
00:26:08,443 --> 00:26:09,527
So, what happened?

455
00:26:09,610 --> 00:26:10,810
I don't want to talk about it.

456
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:12,237
Who is she?

457
00:26:12,322 --> 00:26:13,906
- She's a friend.
- A friend?

458
00:26:13,990 --> 00:26:14,990
Take a look at this.

459
00:26:15,492 --> 00:26:16,867
I got this last night.

460
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:19,472
-They say it's French food.
-[Tanny] So you already
at it again.

461
00:26:19,496 --> 00:26:20,330
- I don't know.
- Oh, yes!

462
00:26:20,413 --> 00:26:21,664
It is! Ratatouille.

463
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:22,623
- Yeah?
- Yeah!

464
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:25,209
I didn't think
it was that good,
but you try it.

465
00:26:25,293 --> 00:26:26,544
Tell me if you think it's good.

466
00:26:26,627 --> 00:26:27,938
...this thing that you
keep doing.

467
00:26:27,962 --> 00:26:31,090
I really don't need
life advice from you right now,
okay? Please.

468
00:26:31,174 --> 00:26:33,009
[Grandma]
Vincent, is that you?

469
00:26:33,926 --> 00:26:35,303
Grandma's here?

470
00:26:35,761 --> 00:26:37,138
You better go say hi.

471
00:26:39,849 --> 00:26:42,035
Hey, baby, can you get
that lemonade
and bring it in here?

472
00:26:42,059 --> 00:26:43,059
Yeah.

473
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,147
I missed you when I came in.

474
00:26:46,230 --> 00:26:47,773
I was outside getting lemons.

475
00:26:48,316 --> 00:26:49,233
Hi.

476
00:26:49,317 --> 00:26:50,401
[kissing]

477
00:26:52,945 --> 00:26:53,946
I'll pay you back.

478
00:26:54,030 --> 00:26:55,174
[Grandma]
Hey, I won't hold
my breath.

479
00:26:55,198 --> 00:26:56,198
Set it down right here.

480
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,074
Now who's this?

481
00:26:57,158 --> 00:26:58,576
This is Josephine, Ma.

482
00:26:59,160 --> 00:27:01,371
That's Vincent's friend.
She lives in Paris.

483
00:27:01,454 --> 00:27:02,663
I wanna live in Paris.

484
00:27:02,872 --> 00:27:04,999
Half the year.
Six months on, six months off.

485
00:27:05,082 --> 00:27:08,123
That's cool, Ma.
But how am I going to bring you
cookies if you live in Paris?

486
00:27:08,461 --> 00:27:10,129
- How is your father?
- He's good.

487
00:27:11,214 --> 00:27:12,549
They moved not too far
from here.

488
00:27:12,882 --> 00:27:16,427
Yeah? That's good,
I'm glad they got
out of that other place.

489
00:27:16,969 --> 00:27:18,388
I mean, maybe
they'll be happier.

490
00:27:18,471 --> 00:27:19,805
Dad's happy, all right?

491
00:27:20,014 --> 00:27:21,950
They're actually talking
about having another kid.

492
00:27:21,974 --> 00:27:23,434
[Grandma and Tanny chuckling]

493
00:27:24,310 --> 00:27:25,978
Oh, that's something, isn't it?

494
00:27:27,146 --> 00:27:29,607
Hush, Tanny. It's a good thing.

495
00:27:29,815 --> 00:27:30,815
It is.

496
00:27:30,983 --> 00:27:33,027
[Grandma]
Vincent, could you
hand me my purse?

497
00:27:34,862 --> 00:27:35,988
Thank you.

498
00:27:37,615 --> 00:27:39,658
You didn't steal anything,
did you?

499
00:27:40,368 --> 00:27:41,869
I always say to your mother,

500
00:27:41,952 --> 00:27:44,288
don't lie, don't cheat,
don't steal.

501
00:27:44,705 --> 00:27:45,998
Don't I always say that?

502
00:27:46,707 --> 00:27:48,042
Hmm. Who has a joke?

503
00:27:48,709 --> 00:27:49,752
Do you know a joke?

504
00:27:50,794 --> 00:27:51,837
I have a joke.

505
00:27:52,755 --> 00:27:54,215
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

506
00:27:54,298 --> 00:27:55,925
Shut the fuck up
and get out of my house.

507
00:28:06,310 --> 00:28:08,354
Oh, come on,
that was funny. [giggles]

508
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:10,940
You guys didn't think
that was funny?

509
00:28:11,107 --> 00:28:12,983
Yeah.
You're funny, Ma.

510
00:28:13,067 --> 00:28:14,068
Yeah, that's funny.

511
00:28:14,151 --> 00:28:15,551
[chuckles]
She's right, she's funny.

512
00:28:15,778 --> 00:28:16,820
What about you, Ma?

513
00:28:17,655 --> 00:28:19,616
You seeing anybody?
It's kind of been a while.

514
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:21,492
You're still wearing that ring.

515
00:28:27,164 --> 00:28:28,416
I need the key back.

516
00:28:29,500 --> 00:28:31,752
I mean you just come barging in.

517
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:33,920
It's fine.

518
00:28:37,634 --> 00:28:39,176
It's time to get the key back.

519
00:28:44,474 --> 00:28:46,142
[Ma]
Keep it, for now.

520
00:28:46,684 --> 00:28:48,686
[Vincent]
A few years after
my parents split up,

521
00:28:48,769 --> 00:28:51,439
I found an old letter
left open on my
mom's desk.

522
00:28:52,898 --> 00:28:55,859
Basically I saw that
she was the one
that actually cheated.

523
00:28:56,277 --> 00:28:57,403
[Ma] Whoo!

524
00:28:57,528 --> 00:28:59,238
You are Mr. Clown.

525
00:28:59,322 --> 00:29:01,198
Yeah, I'm Mr. Clown.

526
00:29:01,324 --> 00:29:05,286
- [Ma] All right.
- [Pa] Very good.

527
00:29:05,453 --> 00:29:07,788
[Ma laughs] Is that enough?

528
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:10,291
Is that enough makeup?

529
00:29:10,374 --> 00:29:11,459
[Pa]
What's it all mean?

530
00:29:11,542 --> 00:29:13,794
What are you going to think
when you look back on this,

531
00:29:14,044 --> 00:29:15,630
20 years from now?

532
00:29:18,382 --> 00:29:19,842
[Ma]
I'm going to be happy.

533
00:29:23,053 --> 00:29:24,180
[Pa] What else?

534
00:29:26,599 --> 00:29:28,976
Uh, I don't know,
these are good times.

535
00:29:29,185 --> 00:29:32,647
I'm happy, I'm thrilled.
I want that ring.
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

536
00:29:34,398 --> 00:29:35,983
[Vincent] Mom!

537
00:29:36,526 --> 00:29:38,194
Come this way.
Let's see the kitchen.

538
00:29:38,902 --> 00:29:41,739
This is Stephanie,
the matron of the house.

539
00:29:43,282 --> 00:29:45,368
Okay, Steph, say "I love you."

540
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:48,579
Baby, you don't know
how to do that.

541
00:29:49,121 --> 00:29:51,165
You can say, "Steph, action."
You can say something.

542
00:29:51,248 --> 00:29:52,934
You don't have to say,
"Steph talk to yourself."

543
00:29:52,958 --> 00:29:55,211
It kind of seems like
you're making me do it!

544
00:29:57,254 --> 00:29:59,590
[Vincent coughing]

545
00:30:00,550 --> 00:30:01,634
Spit it up.

546
00:30:04,387 --> 00:30:05,513
You all right?

547
00:30:06,263 --> 00:30:08,932
The closet, no skeletons
in the closet quite yet.

548
00:30:10,560 --> 00:30:11,620
Steph, why are you throwing...

549
00:30:11,644 --> 00:30:14,355
I'm not throwing.
Just for a second...

550
00:30:14,438 --> 00:30:16,357
- That's recyclable.
- No, no...

551
00:30:17,107 --> 00:30:19,527
-Why are you throwing?
All right.
-I'm not throwing.

552
00:30:21,696 --> 00:30:24,699
[Pa]
Good thing we don't have tubes
anymore in these cameras.

553
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:28,619
And now is our chance.

554
00:30:28,703 --> 00:30:30,538
[Pa laughing]

555
00:30:55,479 --> 00:30:56,606
That was fun.

556
00:30:57,898 --> 00:30:59,817
Your mom, I mean.

557
00:31:00,859 --> 00:31:03,946
She's very spontaneous,
um, I would say.

558
00:31:05,239 --> 00:31:06,365
She's like...

559
00:31:06,657 --> 00:31:08,951
No, no, no...
And then... [screams]

560
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:13,706
Don't get on me, all right?
You're the one who
wanted to come.

561
00:31:14,039 --> 00:31:16,125
Oh, come on,
don't be a rotten tomato.

562
00:31:17,167 --> 00:31:18,167
What?

563
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:22,214
You know when there's
a ripe tomato and you put it
with the rotten ones?

564
00:31:22,298 --> 00:31:23,215
Then, the ripe ones...

565
00:31:23,299 --> 00:31:26,260
What are you saying?
Can you just say
what you mean, please?

566
00:31:26,552 --> 00:31:29,472
I mean, shit happens.

567
00:31:29,972 --> 00:31:30,972
To everyone.

568
00:31:31,014 --> 00:31:32,099
All the time.

569
00:31:32,683 --> 00:31:35,478
This is our job,
to separate ourselves.

570
00:31:35,812 --> 00:31:37,229
You know, just to stay good.

571
00:31:38,939 --> 00:31:39,939
I mean...

572
00:31:40,357 --> 00:31:43,026
Don't get me wrong,
I was surprised by her joke.
[giggles]

573
00:31:43,569 --> 00:31:48,658
Although I think she might...
she seems to keep things
inside too long.

574
00:31:49,074 --> 00:31:51,243
Yeah, her and my dad
had a nasty breakup,

575
00:31:52,161 --> 00:31:53,830
and I don't think
she really got over it.

576
00:31:54,789 --> 00:31:56,666
You know, she never really
forgave herself.

577
00:32:00,002 --> 00:32:01,814
I warned you though, all right?
You wanted to come.

578
00:32:01,838 --> 00:32:03,297
- Oh, stop.
- That was you.

579
00:32:03,380 --> 00:32:04,380
I loved it.

580
00:32:07,968 --> 00:32:10,248
Un, deux, trois, quatre, cinq,
six, sept, huit, neuf, dix.

581
00:32:10,763 --> 00:32:11,763
Tada.

582
00:32:12,640 --> 00:32:14,057
Every time I need to
let things go,

583
00:32:14,141 --> 00:32:16,310
this is what I do,
feels much better.

584
00:32:16,602 --> 00:32:17,602
You should do that.

585
00:32:18,479 --> 00:32:19,479
Okay.

586
00:32:20,397 --> 00:32:22,501
If someone just told her to
breathe in and count to ten

587
00:32:22,525 --> 00:32:23,918
and everything
will be all right, yeah?

588
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:28,531
Uh, no, it won't solve
everything,
but it's a start.

589
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:31,659
What's up with you?

590
00:32:32,827 --> 00:32:34,161
Is this like you for real?

591
00:32:34,244 --> 00:32:36,044
Like, are you this
chippery all the time or...

592
00:32:37,915 --> 00:32:39,500
Why did you want to
come with me today?

593
00:32:40,334 --> 00:32:43,003
Um, 'cause you were there,
at the corner.

594
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:44,086
I was there.

595
00:32:44,129 --> 00:32:47,675
Yeah, I mean, it could easily
have been someone else,

596
00:32:48,008 --> 00:32:49,259
but it happened to be you,

597
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:51,220
so I guess
we were to meet today.

598
00:32:52,012 --> 00:32:53,013
[giggles]

599
00:32:54,932 --> 00:32:56,600
And, hey, that's mine.
[laughs]

600
00:32:56,684 --> 00:32:58,871
- Which one? This one's yours?
- Oh, that one in your mouth.

601
00:32:58,895 --> 00:33:00,735
- Butthead, that's my taco.
- This one's yours?

602
00:33:00,771 --> 00:33:02,648
You're going to continue
to eat that, also?

603
00:33:02,732 --> 00:33:03,774
Thank you.

604
00:33:05,108 --> 00:33:08,404
Butthead, where did you learn
to speak English, the 90s?

605
00:33:08,487 --> 00:33:09,822
Did the 90s teach you?

606
00:33:10,239 --> 00:33:11,824
[phone ringing]

607
00:33:13,576 --> 00:33:16,161
Hey! do you wanna
watch any music tonight?

608
00:33:18,497 --> 00:33:19,497
Oh!

609
00:33:20,499 --> 00:33:21,625
And he quiets it.

610
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:24,545
Hold my calls, please.

611
00:33:28,716 --> 00:33:31,677
No, actually, I have some stuff
to do tonight. You done?

612
00:33:31,802 --> 00:33:33,053
[phone ringing]

613
00:33:33,512 --> 00:33:35,073
I think she wants
to talk to you though.

614
00:33:36,682 --> 00:33:37,683
I'll talk to her later.

615
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:40,644
Maybe it's important.

616
00:33:44,607 --> 00:33:45,887
I don't know,
should we find out?

617
00:33:54,784 --> 00:33:56,911
[phone keeps ringing]

618
00:34:00,038 --> 00:34:01,248
[phone stops ringing]

619
00:34:05,502 --> 00:34:06,502
Ready?

620
00:34:16,179 --> 00:34:18,223
Bye, gracias.

621
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:23,100
-That was good, right?
That's my favorite spot.
-Yes.

622
00:34:23,813 --> 00:34:26,106
I think that was the best
tacos I've ever had.

623
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:31,988
I never really eat tacos though.

624
00:34:35,157 --> 00:34:36,867
- They must be your friends.
- Why?

625
00:34:37,451 --> 00:34:39,161
Because they pollute the planet.

626
00:34:41,371 --> 00:34:44,249
Yo, brother,
you live around here?

627
00:34:45,501 --> 00:34:47,419
-What's up?
-I said, do you live
around here?

628
00:34:47,503 --> 00:34:49,379
What do you mean,
do we live
around here, bro?

629
00:34:49,463 --> 00:34:51,064
Hey, have a nice day
with your girl, man.

630
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:52,609
No, no, no.
I don't think you heard me.

631
00:34:52,925 --> 00:34:54,927
Well, I heard you,
but what does it
mean to you?

632
00:34:55,011 --> 00:34:56,303
There's a trash can right there.

633
00:34:56,595 --> 00:34:57,471
Meaning?

634
00:34:57,554 --> 00:35:00,366
Meaning you should probably
just pick it up, throw it away,
it takes two seconds.

635
00:35:00,390 --> 00:35:01,266
Excuse me?

636
00:35:01,350 --> 00:35:03,119
Yeah, man, go for it,
don't pollute the planet.

637
00:35:03,143 --> 00:35:04,983
Look, I don't think
you want to walk over here.

638
00:35:06,939 --> 00:35:08,220
Looks like I'm already
over here.

639
00:35:09,483 --> 00:35:10,651
Pick up that fucking butt.

640
00:35:16,365 --> 00:35:17,282
You good?

641
00:35:17,366 --> 00:35:18,241
After you pick it up.

642
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:20,077
Okay, how about I pick it up?

643
00:35:20,202 --> 00:35:21,912
You all wanna be childs.

644
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:23,517
- Come on, man, pick up that...
- What?

645
00:35:23,664 --> 00:35:24,790
Hey, stop!

646
00:35:24,915 --> 00:35:26,196
What are you talking about, bro?

647
00:35:26,416 --> 00:35:29,670
All right, fuck him, fuck him.

648
00:35:31,547 --> 00:35:33,007
Just teach your man
some manners.

649
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:34,550
Have a nice one.

650
00:35:40,389 --> 00:35:42,016
Why would you do that?

651
00:35:46,020 --> 00:35:47,063
You think it's funny?

652
00:35:50,273 --> 00:35:52,192
Why would you do that
to them or to yourself?

653
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:53,275
I don't get it.

654
00:35:55,237 --> 00:35:56,906
This is what you want,
you want to fight?

655
00:35:57,614 --> 00:36:00,158
You want to be bad, huh?
You want to hurt someone.

656
00:36:06,540 --> 00:36:07,958
I think this day is over.

657
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,754
I thought you were someone good.

658
00:36:14,048 --> 00:36:15,758
But I don't want to
be your friend.

659
00:36:20,137 --> 00:36:22,598
You have litter in your heart.

660
00:36:32,942 --> 00:36:36,862
-It's an earthquake, babe.
It's an earthquake.
-[giggling]

661
00:36:38,072 --> 00:36:39,531
Hey, it's an earthquake.

662
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,885
- Hey, it's an earthquake.
- [giggling]

663
00:36:42,118 --> 00:36:44,512
Seriously, an earthquake.
You gotta get under
something sturdy.

664
00:36:44,536 --> 00:36:45,996
Okay, be my something sturdy.

665
00:36:46,080 --> 00:36:47,641
No, there's no time
for that, all right?

666
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:49,583
There's a earthquake,
it's a earthquake.

667
00:36:49,666 --> 00:36:52,252
Come on, there's always time
to kiss my babe.

668
00:37:06,391 --> 00:37:09,019
I could lay here with you
on this island forever.

669
00:37:09,853 --> 00:37:14,650
And ever, and ever,
and ever, and ever...
And ever!

670
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,234
Hmm.

671
00:37:19,321 --> 00:37:20,530
I could too.

672
00:37:23,993 --> 00:37:26,120
But I gotta go, come on.

673
00:37:28,038 --> 00:37:30,759
-Babe, babe, you don't want to
burn those little toes.
-[laughs] What?

674
00:37:30,791 --> 00:37:33,512
That's lava, all right?
You're only safe from
the volcano in this bed.

675
00:37:33,543 --> 00:37:36,713
Wait a second,
I thought it was an earthquake,
now it's a volcano?

676
00:37:36,922 --> 00:37:38,298
Get your story straight, mister.

677
00:37:39,549 --> 00:37:42,344
This is our fantasy island,
it could be whatever
we want it to be.

678
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:45,483
[Vincent]
What am I supposed
to do with this?

679
00:37:45,931 --> 00:37:47,641
- With what?
- This!

680
00:37:47,724 --> 00:37:51,520
Babe, put that away,
they're going to be here
any second.

681
00:37:52,062 --> 00:37:54,272
No, I love it. [laughs]

682
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:56,692
I love it.
No, put it away.

683
00:37:58,777 --> 00:38:00,863
Just jerk off by my lone-ski.

684
00:38:02,447 --> 00:38:04,867
-No, wait.
Save me from the lava.
-[Vincent screams]

685
00:38:04,950 --> 00:38:06,576
[both laughing]

686
00:38:06,702 --> 00:38:08,078
Give me that.

687
00:38:08,162 --> 00:38:10,706
But I...
that was mine.

688
00:38:11,081 --> 00:38:12,166
Now it's mine.

689
00:38:12,249 --> 00:38:13,333
Share.

690
00:38:14,793 --> 00:38:16,003
[both grunting]

691
00:38:16,086 --> 00:38:17,420
In your face.
That was your face.

692
00:38:17,546 --> 00:38:19,048
[both groaning]

693
00:38:19,131 --> 00:38:20,590
[Jess]
What are you guys doing?

694
00:38:21,175 --> 00:38:22,676
Why are you doing
that to each other?

695
00:38:22,759 --> 00:38:23,635
Because it's fun.

696
00:38:23,719 --> 00:38:24,636
Because we're men.

697
00:38:24,720 --> 00:38:26,400
Why does anybody do
anything to each other?

698
00:38:26,429 --> 00:38:27,429
[Steve shouts]
A man!

699
00:38:27,472 --> 00:38:29,016
Come on, get off the roof.

700
00:38:30,142 --> 00:38:31,161
I almost ate your hot dog.

701
00:38:31,185 --> 00:38:32,185
Holster that.

702
00:38:32,228 --> 00:38:33,228
- Bam!
- Bro... whoa!

703
00:38:34,479 --> 00:38:35,898
[Steve]
Right in the face. Ack!

704
00:38:35,981 --> 00:38:37,440
So gross. Surprise attack!

705
00:38:37,524 --> 00:38:38,400
[Vincent and Steve shout]

706
00:38:38,483 --> 00:38:39,669
- Boom! Boom!
- [Steve] That's not fair.

707
00:38:39,693 --> 00:38:42,173
You're going to get roughed up.
You're going to get roughed up.

708
00:38:42,238 --> 00:38:43,280
Is it time to eat?

709
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:44,322
Yeah.

710
00:38:44,489 --> 00:38:46,909
- Meow.
- Oh, poor Stevie.

711
00:38:46,992 --> 00:38:47,992
[Roma] Got buns.

712
00:38:52,998 --> 00:38:54,416
Ooh, thank you, sir.

713
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:56,752
Uh... feed me
my grapes, woman.

714
00:38:57,127 --> 00:38:58,212
- You want grapes?
- Uh-huh.

715
00:38:58,295 --> 00:39:00,547
Oh-ho-ho. Oh, no! Oh...

716
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,069
- [Steve]Look at that.
- [Roma] I got you everywhere.

717
00:39:04,093 --> 00:39:05,468
I deserved it.

718
00:39:06,303 --> 00:39:07,637
[Jess and Vincent kissing]

719
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:10,057
You guys are cute.

720
00:39:10,974 --> 00:39:12,392
How long have you been together?

721
00:39:13,143 --> 00:39:14,144
Six months.

722
00:39:14,228 --> 00:39:16,438
Babe, it's been 11 months.

723
00:39:16,521 --> 00:39:19,649
That's what I said,
11 glorious moons.

724
00:39:20,483 --> 00:39:22,360
And you, you...

725
00:39:22,736 --> 00:39:24,130
Stop making trouble,
you troublemaker.

726
00:39:24,154 --> 00:39:27,116
Wait, don't blame her
because you're terrible
at keeping time.

727
00:39:27,199 --> 00:39:29,920
Don't worry about it.
My boy V, he's always been
a little out of step.

728
00:39:29,952 --> 00:39:30,869
What?

729
00:39:30,953 --> 00:39:31,954
Always late to work,

730
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:35,415
used to hand in his homework
with the most awful excuse.

731
00:39:35,498 --> 00:39:37,518
I feel like you're
assassinating
my character right now.

732
00:39:37,542 --> 00:39:39,920
-And he missed my star
making turn as Peter Pan.
-[gasps]

733
00:39:40,045 --> 00:39:41,922
No, no, no,
hey, I didn't miss it,

734
00:39:42,005 --> 00:39:45,759
I just walked
in the auditorium doors
and you were like, "thank you."

735
00:39:45,926 --> 00:39:47,136
That's missing it.

736
00:39:47,219 --> 00:39:48,345
Yeah, but whatever though.

737
00:39:48,470 --> 00:39:49,512
At least I told you.

738
00:39:49,846 --> 00:39:52,099
Could've just lied
and said you killed it.

739
00:39:52,182 --> 00:39:54,517
But you didn't
because you're a good man.

740
00:39:54,726 --> 00:39:55,644
[both growl]

741
00:39:55,727 --> 00:39:56,645
Thank you.

742
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:59,189
- It was a riveting bout, man.
- Oh, get outta here.

743
00:39:59,606 --> 00:40:00,899
Shit, now I feel bad.

744
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:03,693
I feel like I need a time
machine to go back
and redeem myself.

745
00:40:03,777 --> 00:40:05,237
Ooh, I'd love a time machine.

746
00:40:05,362 --> 00:40:07,006
[Steve]
You know where I'd go
with a time machine?

747
00:40:07,030 --> 00:40:08,365
- [Roma] Where?
- Nowhere.

748
00:40:08,490 --> 00:40:09,825
I wouldn't change shit.

749
00:40:09,950 --> 00:40:12,119
My life is perfect
the way it is right now.

750
00:40:12,202 --> 00:40:15,538
I wouldn't change shit
'cause then I wouldn't have
met you, or you or you.

751
00:40:15,664 --> 00:40:17,166
- Aww.
- [Vincent] That's so sweet.

752
00:40:17,249 --> 00:40:18,334
Aww... [blows raspberry]

753
00:40:19,001 --> 00:40:21,628
- Uh... I heard that.
- [laughs] Ow.

754
00:40:21,711 --> 00:40:23,088
[Steve laughing] Aaack!

755
00:40:23,588 --> 00:40:25,757
That's nice, but I know
exactly where I would go.

756
00:40:25,841 --> 00:40:28,260
I would get in my time machine
and go right to ancient Egypt

757
00:40:28,344 --> 00:40:29,427
and be Cleopatra.

758
00:40:29,511 --> 00:40:31,906
Wait. What are the rules
of this game? Now we
can just be people?

759
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:33,015
It's not your turn.

760
00:40:33,098 --> 00:40:36,101
[Jess]
I would rule as queen.
I would wear lots of jewelry,

761
00:40:36,185 --> 00:40:38,061
and have, like,
beautiful snakes.

762
00:40:38,145 --> 00:40:39,146
[Roma] Get it, girl.

763
00:40:39,229 --> 00:40:40,105
That sounds good,

764
00:40:40,189 --> 00:40:41,648
I could do ancient Egypt,
let's go.

765
00:40:41,731 --> 00:40:43,168
No, your ass
would be a servant, man,

766
00:40:43,192 --> 00:40:45,378
carrying around a cart
on your shoulders, like...
[groaning]

767
00:40:45,402 --> 00:40:48,071
Oh, yeah, but I'd be, like,
that big, beautiful
brown servant,

768
00:40:48,155 --> 00:40:50,032
who rose through the ranks
and became Pharaoh.

769
00:40:50,157 --> 00:40:51,158
[Roma and Jess laughing]

770
00:40:51,241 --> 00:40:53,160
You'd be Aladdin
without the genie, my man.

771
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:55,704
A common street thief,
right down there.

772
00:40:55,787 --> 00:40:57,289
Oh, save me, Roma.

773
00:40:57,914 --> 00:41:01,668
Okay, I'd go to Germany
early 1900s.

774
00:41:01,751 --> 00:41:04,087
I'd be Hitler's
childhood art teacher.

775
00:41:04,171 --> 00:41:05,172
What?

776
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,049
For real, listen.

777
00:41:07,132 --> 00:41:09,759
He was supposed to be
a really talented painter.

778
00:41:09,843 --> 00:41:13,596
So, I feel like if he was just
supported and nurtured

779
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:16,683
and encouraged a little bit,
things could've been different.

780
00:41:18,435 --> 00:41:21,063
Yeah, maybe you can give him
a little nickname, right?

781
00:41:21,897 --> 00:41:23,106
[Steve] Yeah, like Dolphy.

782
00:41:23,315 --> 00:41:25,067
Hey, nice finger painting,
Dolphy.

783
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,360
- Babe.
- Paintbrush!

784
00:41:26,484 --> 00:41:27,485
[Steve laughing]

785
00:41:27,569 --> 00:41:31,323
All right, you guys, you guys
can laugh all you want,

786
00:41:31,448 --> 00:41:33,742
but I'm using my time machine
to change history,

787
00:41:33,825 --> 00:41:35,035
what are you guys doing?

788
00:41:35,118 --> 00:41:36,595
[Vincent]
I'll tell you exactly
what I'm doing.

789
00:41:36,619 --> 00:41:38,663
I'm just biffing the shit
out of this motherfucker

790
00:41:38,788 --> 00:41:41,124
and going back in time and
betting on all the Superbowls

791
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,044
and then I'm going to invent
something crazy,
like the jigsaw puzzle.

792
00:41:44,127 --> 00:41:47,172
That's not crazy,
why wouldn't you invent, like,
the iPhone or something?

793
00:41:47,256 --> 00:41:49,299
'Cause I don't know
how to invent an iPhone, man.

794
00:41:49,466 --> 00:41:50,717
A jigsaw puzzle's easy,

795
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,344
just take a picture,
cut it out...

796
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,264
Sell it to people.
Jumanji. I'm rich.

797
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,973
Cleopatra has to use the loo.

798
00:41:57,057 --> 00:41:58,058
Go use, darling.

799
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:00,203
Is it number one or number two?

800
00:42:00,227 --> 00:42:01,103
- Gross.
- [Steve] Bro...

801
00:42:01,186 --> 00:42:03,813
I'm just saying,
if it's number two
it's also number one

802
00:42:03,897 --> 00:42:05,023
or maybe it's number three.

803
00:42:05,107 --> 00:42:06,400
No, conversation stops now.

804
00:42:06,483 --> 00:42:07,793
[Steve]
Stop badgering the witness.

805
00:42:07,817 --> 00:42:09,503
Jessica, you don't have to
answer these questions.

806
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:11,154
No one knows
what I'm talking about?

807
00:42:11,238 --> 00:42:14,157
These are not lady questions,
therefore, you do not ask us
ladies.

808
00:42:14,241 --> 00:42:15,241
Thank you.

809
00:42:15,284 --> 00:42:17,764
And besides, wasn't this about
you redeeming yourself, anyways.

810
00:42:17,827 --> 00:42:20,289
You missed your best friend
in Peter Pan jammy jam.

811
00:42:20,372 --> 00:42:21,915
How many chances
you get at that?

812
00:42:24,376 --> 00:42:26,753
But, I totally pee too.

813
00:42:27,837 --> 00:42:29,131
Pee-pee when I poo-poo.

814
00:42:29,214 --> 00:42:30,214
Pee.

815
00:42:31,674 --> 00:42:33,843
- What? what did I miss?
- Nothing.

816
00:42:34,928 --> 00:42:38,432
Ooh. Vincent, bro...
You gotta show them
the spaghetti...

817
00:42:38,515 --> 00:42:40,116
-You gotta show them
the spaghetti.
-What?

818
00:42:40,267 --> 00:42:41,643
Spaghetti, right now?

819
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:43,979
Yeah, you gotta see this,
it's crazy, Spaghetti arms.

820
00:42:44,062 --> 00:42:45,062
Are you ready?

821
00:42:46,231 --> 00:42:47,774
[Steve laughs loudly]

822
00:42:47,857 --> 00:42:48,733
It's like spaghetti.

823
00:42:48,858 --> 00:42:50,693
- So floppy, Spaghetti arms.
- [laughing]

824
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,531
Oh, I love this.

825
00:42:58,076 --> 00:43:01,913
Hey, I'm glad you're here,
all right?

826
00:43:06,376 --> 00:43:07,377
Babe?

827
00:43:19,014 --> 00:43:20,014
[Ozzie] Vincent.

828
00:43:20,223 --> 00:43:21,308
Ozzie, what's going on man?

829
00:43:21,391 --> 00:43:22,391
What's up?

830
00:43:22,684 --> 00:43:25,270
Hey, you mind if I come in
and grab a drink or something?

831
00:43:26,146 --> 00:43:27,730
Yeah, I mean, I'm setting up.

832
00:43:27,814 --> 00:43:29,614
You want to come in
and hang out, that's fine.

833
00:43:29,691 --> 00:43:30,691
Please.

834
00:43:33,862 --> 00:43:34,988
Where you been?

835
00:43:35,655 --> 00:43:36,739
I haven't seen you around.

836
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:40,660
[sighs] Been around.

837
00:43:40,994 --> 00:43:44,914
I was...
I was in here
the other night.

838
00:43:49,669 --> 00:43:52,797
Yeah? I must've...

839
00:43:53,340 --> 00:43:55,675
I must've missed you.
Were you with Steve and Roma?

840
00:43:58,345 --> 00:43:59,345
Yep.

841
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,102
[dial tone]

842
00:44:08,021 --> 00:44:09,981
[Steve] Ha-ha. You found me.

843
00:44:10,315 --> 00:44:12,359
I'm probably in the midst
of a wild encounter.

844
00:44:12,442 --> 00:44:14,861
So, leave a detailed request

845
00:44:15,070 --> 00:44:17,780
and your boy will surely
take care of you, peace.

846
00:44:19,282 --> 00:44:20,700
What up? It's me, man.

847
00:44:21,117 --> 00:44:22,827
Give me a call
when you get off work.

848
00:44:23,286 --> 00:44:26,873
Let's get a drink or something,
fucking do it.

849
00:44:38,510 --> 00:44:42,138
Well, I guess what I'm saying
is that everything is elastic.

850
00:44:42,514 --> 00:44:43,848
You know, like this trampoline.

851
00:44:43,932 --> 00:44:45,725
Like when you're on the ground,
you're down.

852
00:44:46,059 --> 00:44:47,185
But when you're up,

853
00:44:47,310 --> 00:44:49,414
well, you never feel like
you're going to hit
the ground again,

854
00:44:49,438 --> 00:44:52,190
until, well, you do, you know?

855
00:44:52,399 --> 00:44:54,109
Yeah, man,
I feel you 100 percent.

856
00:44:54,192 --> 00:44:56,612
- Whoo! Okay, whoa!
- Yeah!

857
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:57,946
Hey, don't hurt yourself.

858
00:44:58,029 --> 00:45:00,365
Seriously, stay sharp, man.
I need you to stay sharp.

859
00:45:01,157 --> 00:45:03,410
Hurt myself? Vincent!

860
00:45:03,785 --> 00:45:06,121
I'm helping myself
right now, man.

861
00:45:06,204 --> 00:45:07,830
I am literally...

862
00:45:08,582 --> 00:45:10,459
- Whoo!
- I'm literally flying!

863
00:45:10,542 --> 00:45:12,710
Whoa! Whoo!

864
00:45:12,961 --> 00:45:17,299
And even if it wasn't
for this trampoline,
I am so damn high right now.

865
00:45:17,382 --> 00:45:19,050
It's all because of you, baby.

866
00:45:19,175 --> 00:45:21,219
No, honestly,
it's so beautiful, man.

867
00:45:21,303 --> 00:45:23,513
Look, you are
a beautiful human being,

868
00:45:23,888 --> 00:45:25,223
she's a beautiful girl

869
00:45:25,807 --> 00:45:27,826
and I just love that
you guys are together.
It's great.

870
00:45:27,850 --> 00:45:29,561
Such a good thing, man, finally.

871
00:45:38,278 --> 00:45:40,071
Listen, I think
she could be the one.

872
00:45:41,990 --> 00:45:43,741
I mean, craziest part
about it, man, is...

873
00:45:44,451 --> 00:45:46,536
it's not even just
about who she is

874
00:45:46,620 --> 00:45:48,746
because, I mean,
who she is incredible.

875
00:45:49,289 --> 00:45:51,082
But it's also about
where she came from.

876
00:45:52,375 --> 00:45:56,129
Dude, she came from you.

877
00:45:57,255 --> 00:45:58,340
My brother.

878
00:45:58,881 --> 00:46:00,883
I mean, it makes
perfect sense to me

879
00:46:00,967 --> 00:46:03,637
that you would be the one
to bring her to me.

880
00:46:04,053 --> 00:46:05,639
God, I love you, man.

881
00:46:07,683 --> 00:46:09,976
Honestly, I'm just happy
we can double date again.

882
00:46:10,059 --> 00:46:12,812
Because I was getting
tired of you third wheeling
on us all the time.

883
00:46:13,480 --> 00:46:16,316
You were just third wheeling.
It's like, this ain't a menage.

884
00:46:16,399 --> 00:46:17,609
Bitty ass tricycle.

885
00:46:18,401 --> 00:46:19,486
Bitty ass tricycle.

886
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:22,489
Vincent.

887
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:23,657
Yes.

888
00:46:23,823 --> 00:46:24,949
Scream with me.

889
00:46:25,659 --> 00:46:27,994
[both scream]

890
00:46:30,955 --> 00:46:33,082
Think of all the babies
we're going to have, Vincent.

891
00:46:33,166 --> 00:46:34,792
All of these little red balls
are babies

892
00:46:34,876 --> 00:46:37,587
and I'm going to name one of
them after you, little Vincent.

893
00:46:38,046 --> 00:46:40,382
Honduran-Indian,
Vince the Great.

894
00:46:41,216 --> 00:46:42,967
- Vincent the Great!
- Okay! That's great...

895
00:46:43,218 --> 00:46:44,469
[chuckles] Watch yourself.

896
00:46:46,680 --> 00:46:49,098
[Steve]
I mean, to be honest,
I was almost a little surprised

897
00:46:49,182 --> 00:46:50,684
you didn't go after her
yourself.

898
00:46:54,020 --> 00:46:55,020
Vincent.

899
00:48:14,392 --> 00:48:16,603
Give me that necklace.

900
00:48:16,686 --> 00:48:18,438
Oh, nice guy.

901
00:48:18,563 --> 00:48:19,773
- 'Sup, car lady?
- Hey!

902
00:48:20,064 --> 00:48:21,650
- How are you?
- [laughs]

903
00:48:22,150 --> 00:48:26,237
Good. You know, I was thinking
seeing as you don't have
your own car,

904
00:48:26,446 --> 00:48:28,615
I do have this hook up
on this truck.

905
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,760
A truck?
Is that what you think
I should be driving?

906
00:48:30,784 --> 00:48:32,745
'Cause I think I look
pretty dope
in that ice blue.

907
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:35,705
Yeah, but that's not your car,
that's your girlfriend's.

908
00:48:37,749 --> 00:48:40,710
Actually,
that's my car,
but, shh!

909
00:48:40,836 --> 00:48:42,671
Let's just keep
that between you and me,
huh?

910
00:48:42,754 --> 00:48:44,172
- Okay.
- Can we do that?

911
00:48:44,255 --> 00:48:46,132
We can do that, secret's safe.

912
00:48:46,215 --> 00:48:47,216
I appreciate that.

913
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:48,300
You're welcome.

914
00:48:48,926 --> 00:48:52,597
[chuckles] Whoa. Well,
hi, skippity poo-pie!

915
00:48:52,681 --> 00:48:54,474
Who is this little belle
and a half?

916
00:48:54,641 --> 00:48:56,643
- Ola.
- Ola.

917
00:48:56,726 --> 00:48:59,312
Roma, Steve.
Steve, Roma.

918
00:48:59,395 --> 00:49:00,897
We met at the car wash today.

919
00:49:00,980 --> 00:49:03,191
Well, aren't you
just a little mogwai?

920
00:49:03,274 --> 00:49:04,474
Did you come from the Tropics?

921
00:49:04,567 --> 00:49:05,401
[giggles]

922
00:49:05,485 --> 00:49:09,030
Yes, actually, I come
from the ancient rain forest

923
00:49:09,113 --> 00:49:11,157
in the deep jungles of Honduras.

924
00:49:11,240 --> 00:49:12,784
- I've been there.
- No.

925
00:49:12,868 --> 00:49:15,411
Many times,
18 times to be exact.

926
00:49:15,495 --> 00:49:17,997
I like to be exact,
it's very important.

927
00:49:18,080 --> 00:49:19,875
We must always be exact

928
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:22,669
because to be exact
is to be divine.

929
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:24,170
You two behave.

930
00:49:25,004 --> 00:49:27,507
- [whispers] My gift to you.
- [chuckles]

931
00:49:27,757 --> 00:49:30,134
And I'll catch you all
in a momentito.

932
00:49:31,302 --> 00:49:32,970
Behave?
What the fuck is that?

933
00:49:33,179 --> 00:49:34,639
- Oh, I don't know,
- [chuckles]

934
00:49:34,723 --> 00:49:37,183
behavior is something I choose
not to acknowledge, I...

935
00:49:37,266 --> 00:49:40,019
-it's very existence
seems primitive.
-Mmm-hmm.

936
00:49:43,398 --> 00:49:45,859
I said that. Why?
Is this your place?

937
00:49:45,942 --> 00:49:47,402
No, my creation.

938
00:49:47,610 --> 00:49:51,781
I do not live here,
but I did create this
wonderland of wondery.

939
00:49:51,865 --> 00:49:52,990
And it's wonderful.

940
00:49:53,074 --> 00:49:54,075
May I?

941
00:49:54,242 --> 00:49:56,411
You may, show me.

942
00:49:56,494 --> 00:49:59,247
- Yes, ma'am or senorita.
- [Roma chuckles]

943
00:50:01,541 --> 00:50:03,960
[people chattering]

944
00:50:13,678 --> 00:50:17,807
Hey, pretty,
nice to meet you.
Love it.

945
00:50:22,520 --> 00:50:25,648
[people chattering, cheering]

946
00:50:31,571 --> 00:50:34,115
[cheering]

947
00:50:44,960 --> 00:50:47,670
Hello, I'm going to...
Oh, my God!

948
00:50:48,421 --> 00:50:49,965
Both of you are really drunk.

949
00:50:50,339 --> 00:50:52,717
I wasn't looking for you,
but I found you!

950
00:50:53,384 --> 00:50:56,930
Come here. I'm sorry,
I won't enjoy.
You enjoy, you stay here.

951
00:50:57,013 --> 00:50:59,390
You just do that
for the rest of your life.

952
00:50:59,474 --> 00:51:02,411
-Never stop! Keep on going.
-[Jess] Oh, my God. How did you
guys meet today?

953
00:51:02,435 --> 00:51:04,896
[Roma]
I met him yesterday
at the car wash.

954
00:51:04,980 --> 00:51:06,415
[Jess]
He's making friends everywhere.

955
00:51:06,439 --> 00:51:07,899
We're in here.
Someone's in here.

956
00:51:07,983 --> 00:51:09,651
[screams]

957
00:51:49,524 --> 00:51:51,233
- Knock, knock.
- Who's there?

958
00:51:51,317 --> 00:51:52,944
- Beware of dog.
- Beware of...

959
00:51:53,028 --> 00:51:55,237
- [screams] Whoo!
- [giggling]

960
00:52:08,543 --> 00:52:10,127
Who's got it?
Does someone have a smoke?

961
00:52:10,837 --> 00:52:11,963
I want to smoke right now.

962
00:52:12,672 --> 00:52:14,131
This gentleman? Okay.

963
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:18,553
Um, excuse me, sir, would you
happen to have a cigarette?

964
00:52:20,471 --> 00:52:24,934
Oh, you're such a good man.
I'm not gonna take
your last one.

965
00:52:25,018 --> 00:52:27,062
- No, I'm not gonna...
- Hey, hey, please.

966
00:52:28,771 --> 00:52:29,898
Do you have a light as well?

967
00:52:29,981 --> 00:52:31,190
Yeah. No problem.

968
00:52:31,774 --> 00:52:32,774
Please.

969
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:34,652
Hold it.

970
00:52:35,778 --> 00:52:36,612
Thank you for everything.

971
00:52:36,696 --> 00:52:39,198
You are a gentleman,
thank you so very much,
good sir.

972
00:52:39,281 --> 00:52:40,281
You get in there.

973
00:52:43,285 --> 00:52:44,787
Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

974
00:53:02,430 --> 00:53:04,348
- Guys!
- Somebody's feeling good.

975
00:53:04,432 --> 00:53:06,392
- Yes!
- Look at this, bastard.

976
00:53:06,893 --> 00:53:09,729
Guy, guys, Okay, guys,
I need to ask you a question.

977
00:53:09,812 --> 00:53:11,613
You know what's happening?
It's question time.

978
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:12,607
Pregunta.

979
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:13,566
Pregunta.

980
00:53:13,649 --> 00:53:14,984
- Pregunta.
- Yes.

981
00:53:15,068 --> 00:53:17,486
Um, how is a
fall wedding for you?

982
00:53:17,570 --> 00:53:19,423
- [gasps, laughs]
- Is a fall wedding excellent?

983
00:53:19,447 --> 00:53:22,658
I'm seeing a new theme,
all white.

984
00:53:22,742 --> 00:53:23,618
Yeah...

985
00:53:23,701 --> 00:53:25,912
- Everyday!
- Everyday!

986
00:53:26,662 --> 00:53:27,662
No!

987
00:53:29,165 --> 00:53:30,750
I'm being serious though, guys.

988
00:53:30,833 --> 00:53:32,752
I've always wanted an exotic
from the Tropics

989
00:53:32,835 --> 00:53:35,421
and she arrived, she's here.

990
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:37,105
- I think you better go grab her.
- What?

991
00:53:37,757 --> 00:53:38,758
Oh, hello.

992
00:53:38,841 --> 00:53:41,844
What's going on here, guys,
secret huddle?

993
00:53:41,928 --> 00:53:44,472
You've been brought inside,
are you cool with that?

994
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:45,473
I think so.

995
00:53:45,556 --> 00:53:49,435
It is here, that you will be
privy to the most private of
information.

996
00:53:49,518 --> 00:53:50,812
You better not say it too loud.

997
00:53:53,022 --> 00:53:54,356
[shushing]

998
00:53:54,482 --> 00:53:57,568
You guys, you guys,
the president's listening.

999
00:53:58,778 --> 00:54:02,991
He's gonna talk, he's gonna talk
to you and you and you.

1000
00:54:03,324 --> 00:54:05,660
And tell you what you need,

1001
00:54:05,743 --> 00:54:08,245
he's gonna tell you
what you need.

1002
00:54:44,448 --> 00:54:46,868
[people chattering]

1003
00:55:15,396 --> 00:55:18,274
Hi. What's up, baby?
Oh, started without me?

1004
00:55:18,357 --> 00:55:19,608
Couldn't order your boy one?

1005
00:55:19,692 --> 00:55:20,693
Mine.

1006
00:55:25,907 --> 00:55:27,075
Whoa, whoa.

1007
00:55:27,158 --> 00:55:29,035
You all right, man?
What's going on?

1008
00:55:29,410 --> 00:55:30,554
Why are you looking
at me like that?

1009
00:55:30,578 --> 00:55:32,496
Hold on for a second.
Hey, Ozzie. Let me... Oh!

1010
00:55:32,580 --> 00:55:33,956
[Ozzie]
Steve, I'm slammed, bro.

1011
00:55:34,040 --> 00:55:36,918
Okay. Sorry, man,
What were you...
you were going to say something.

1012
00:55:37,001 --> 00:55:38,044
Yeah? Maybe...

1013
00:55:40,046 --> 00:55:41,214
Any day now, man.

1014
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:43,340
I slept with Roma.

1015
00:55:55,394 --> 00:55:56,562
[laughing]

1016
00:56:00,108 --> 00:56:02,818
[growls, laughing]

1017
00:56:04,153 --> 00:56:05,404
You're funny, dude.

1018
00:56:09,158 --> 00:56:11,744
Yeah, it's not a joke, man.
We slept together.

1019
00:56:11,827 --> 00:56:13,913
Oh, did you?
How'd you do it?

1020
00:56:13,996 --> 00:56:15,290
Did you get her from the front?

1021
00:56:15,414 --> 00:56:17,292
Did you flip her over
and get her from behind?

1022
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:19,085
Oh! Did she sit on your face?

1023
00:56:23,214 --> 00:56:24,799
[mockingly]
Sleeping with Roma.

1024
00:56:34,683 --> 00:56:36,352
I'm sorry, man.

1025
00:56:44,110 --> 00:56:45,194
I think...

1026
00:57:01,877 --> 00:57:02,962
Yo.

1027
00:57:04,463 --> 00:57:05,547
Get the fuck off me.

1028
00:57:05,631 --> 00:57:06,715
I fucked up, all right.

1029
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:09,520
I don't know how
or why it happened. We didn't
mean for it to go down.

1030
00:57:09,551 --> 00:57:11,804
No, don't!
Don't you...
Don't you fucking...

1031
00:57:16,184 --> 00:57:17,310
What were you thinking?

1032
00:57:17,393 --> 00:57:18,453
I wasn't thinking, all right?

1033
00:57:18,477 --> 00:57:20,398
- I wasn't fucking thinking.
- Get the fuck away!

1034
00:57:20,813 --> 00:57:22,148
What are we cool now?

1035
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:23,983
No, look, I can't ask you
to feel anything.

1036
00:57:24,066 --> 00:57:26,128
Of course you're going to feel
and be how you're going to be,

1037
00:57:26,152 --> 00:57:29,446
but you gotta know man,
you're the one who keeps me
sharp, dawg.

1038
00:57:29,530 --> 00:57:32,241
You're my wingman,
you are my fucking wing,
all right?

1039
00:57:32,325 --> 00:57:33,551
I'd be no one without you.
So...

1040
00:57:33,575 --> 00:57:36,204
Stop it!
Shut your fucking mouth.

1041
00:57:36,871 --> 00:57:38,539
Shut your fucking mouth!

1042
00:57:47,131 --> 00:57:48,525
Okay, I need to ask you
three questions

1043
00:57:48,549 --> 00:57:50,361
and I need you to answer them
immediately, okay?

1044
00:57:50,385 --> 00:57:51,677
How many times did this happen?

1045
00:57:51,927 --> 00:57:52,927
Once.

1046
00:57:53,679 --> 00:57:54,679
When?

1047
00:57:54,847 --> 00:57:55,848
Last night.

1048
00:57:58,351 --> 00:57:59,351
Do you love her?

1049
00:58:04,315 --> 00:58:05,649
[Steve]
Answer to me.
Answer.

1050
00:58:08,236 --> 00:58:09,570
I fucking love you.

1051
00:58:09,653 --> 00:58:10,881
No, Vincent, do you
fucking love her?

1052
00:58:10,905 --> 00:58:14,658
I don't know! I don't know!
I don't know.

1053
00:58:18,037 --> 00:58:19,372
[sobbing]
God-damn you.

1054
00:58:26,670 --> 00:58:27,880
Scream with me, man.

1055
00:58:29,131 --> 00:58:30,483
Come on,
fucking scream with me,
man.

1056
00:58:30,507 --> 00:58:31,675
No. Don't fucking...

1057
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:33,386
Don't run away, scream with me.

1058
00:58:33,469 --> 00:58:35,447
All right, we'll work out
that other shit, come on.

1059
00:58:35,471 --> 00:58:37,139
Just fucking...
Just scream with me.

1060
00:58:37,223 --> 00:58:39,725
Look me in my face like we
fucking do and just do it,

1061
00:58:39,808 --> 00:58:42,186
just scream with me, all right?

1062
00:58:42,270 --> 00:58:43,270
You don't get it.

1063
00:58:43,729 --> 00:58:45,606
[sobbing]

1064
00:58:50,736 --> 00:58:55,283
How did you...
You destroyed me.

1065
00:58:58,786 --> 00:59:00,288
You destroyed me.

1066
00:59:01,247 --> 00:59:02,248
You did.

1067
00:59:06,001 --> 00:59:07,462
How could you do that to me?

1068
00:59:09,046 --> 00:59:10,256
I'm sorry, man.

1069
00:59:12,758 --> 00:59:14,218
I'm so sorry.

1070
00:59:15,136 --> 00:59:19,140
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry.

1071
00:59:48,085 --> 00:59:49,753
[phone ringing]

1072
00:59:50,629 --> 00:59:53,215
[Vincent]
Hello, Roma?

1073
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:01,098
[Roma]
Where are you?

1074
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:04,393
Look, I just called to tell you
what happened.

1075
01:00:07,146 --> 01:00:09,023
You didn't want to talk
to me first?

1076
01:00:09,315 --> 01:00:11,233
I thought we were going to do
this together.

1077
01:00:14,695 --> 01:00:18,157
Vincent, can't we just be in
the same room and we can
talk about this?

1078
01:00:18,574 --> 01:00:21,785
For what? All right. There's
nothing else to talk about.

1079
01:00:23,454 --> 01:00:26,999
I think there's a lot
to fucking talk about.
Last night?

1080
01:00:27,958 --> 01:00:32,296
Where are you right now?
Can you just come here
or I'll meet you?

1081
01:00:34,756 --> 01:00:36,467
If you need me to say it,
I will.

1082
01:00:38,844 --> 01:00:41,472
Please, please say something,
say it.

1083
01:00:41,556 --> 01:00:46,643
I'm not that guy,
I'm not that guy for you,
all right?

1084
01:00:49,230 --> 01:00:54,151
That is not your decision
to make, I get to say who
the guy is for me.

1085
01:00:55,694 --> 01:00:57,446
I want you to be happy.

1086
01:01:06,163 --> 01:01:07,915
You want me to be happy?

1087
01:01:10,251 --> 01:01:13,670
I haven't been able to answer
my phone all day

1088
01:01:13,754 --> 01:01:15,381
or find you

1089
01:01:15,464 --> 01:01:18,467
and now we're having
this conversation
like we're strangers.

1090
01:01:19,927 --> 01:01:21,637
And you want me to be happy?

1091
01:01:26,434 --> 01:01:29,562
Vincent! Hello?

1092
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:33,982
What happened last night
was a mistake.

1093
01:01:40,656 --> 01:01:42,699
I know you don't believe that.

1094
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:47,622
You do not believe that.

1095
01:01:47,704 --> 01:01:50,499
You're right, okay?
Because I just wanted
to fuck you.

1096
01:01:51,500 --> 01:01:53,252
I don't want to be with you,

1097
01:01:53,335 --> 01:01:57,005
I don't love you, I never did.

1098
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:01,760
I guess you got what you wanted.

1099
01:02:06,307 --> 01:02:07,349
I see.

1100
01:02:13,689 --> 01:02:16,233
Look, I called out of courtesy
to tell you what happened.

1101
01:02:18,694 --> 01:02:19,528
Vincent.

1102
01:02:19,612 --> 01:02:21,447
I made a mistake
and I'm trying
to correct it.

1103
01:02:22,531 --> 01:02:23,616
Vincent!

1104
01:02:23,699 --> 01:02:24,980
Take care of yourself,
all right?

1105
01:02:25,033 --> 01:02:26,494
So just fuck me then?

1106
01:02:27,161 --> 01:02:28,829
[car engine revving]

1107
01:02:31,499 --> 01:02:34,960
Vincent? Vincent?

1108
01:03:37,231 --> 01:03:39,816
[Vincent]
I always wondered if my mom
was going to come clean.

1109
01:03:41,318 --> 01:03:42,528
But she never did.

1110
01:03:43,987 --> 01:03:45,698
And I watched
what it did to her.

1111
01:03:47,824 --> 01:03:49,243
That's not happening to me.

1112
01:04:00,087 --> 01:04:05,175
Un, deux, trois, quatre...

1113
01:04:05,342 --> 01:04:08,303
cinq, six...

1114
01:04:08,387 --> 01:04:13,016
sept, huit, neuf, dix.

1115
01:04:20,482 --> 01:04:21,692
Whoa-hoo!

1116
01:04:35,872 --> 01:04:36,915
- Hey.
- Hey.

1117
01:04:36,998 --> 01:04:38,799
I just want to say,
like, you know,
in America,

1118
01:04:38,834 --> 01:04:40,168
we usually come in
from this way.

1119
01:04:40,252 --> 01:04:43,714
It's like a first come,
first serve basis.

1120
01:04:43,798 --> 01:04:45,478
But it's cool,
I'm a gentleman,
so I just...

1121
01:04:46,133 --> 01:04:47,468
Nice to meet you.

1122
01:04:47,635 --> 01:04:50,345
Thank you,
I'll try to remember
that the next time

1123
01:04:50,429 --> 01:04:52,807
I forget I'm in the states,
silly me.

1124
01:04:55,016 --> 01:04:57,645
I do appreciate
your gentlemanliness though,

1125
01:04:57,728 --> 01:04:58,895
helping out the little lady.

1126
01:05:03,275 --> 01:05:04,401
Think nothing of it.

1127
01:05:05,152 --> 01:05:08,905
Except, I always thought
here in America this shit
would manifest as

1128
01:05:08,989 --> 01:05:10,115
take what you want,

1129
01:05:10,198 --> 01:05:11,992
first come, first serve
doesn't really apply.

1130
01:05:12,159 --> 01:05:13,410
Manly man.

1131
01:05:15,162 --> 01:05:17,581
We have too many problems
in America, you know.

1132
01:05:18,666 --> 01:05:20,459
Yeah, so many.

1133
01:05:21,460 --> 01:05:24,713
One being how dirty
your cute little car is.

1134
01:05:26,131 --> 01:05:27,591
- Cute?
- Yeah.

1135
01:05:28,676 --> 01:05:30,135
[chuckles]

1136
01:05:30,886 --> 01:05:32,179
It's my girlfriend's car.

1137
01:05:33,722 --> 01:05:36,141
I don't know, maybe
you should
get your own car?

1138
01:05:37,100 --> 01:05:38,435
What, are you a car dealer?

1139
01:05:38,519 --> 01:05:40,719
I'm just being a gentleman,
washing my girlfriend's car.

1140
01:05:41,814 --> 01:05:44,859
Oh, okay. Mr. Nice Guy.

1141
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:46,443
Thank you.

1142
01:05:59,874 --> 01:06:01,375
So you just galloped on in.

1143
01:06:05,086 --> 01:06:06,338
Actually, I drove it.

1144
01:06:07,882 --> 01:06:08,924
Welcome.

1145
01:06:09,800 --> 01:06:11,259
I just drove in.

1146
01:06:11,677 --> 01:06:12,678
I see.

1147
01:06:14,971 --> 01:06:18,099
So, what is there
for fun to do around here?

1148
01:06:20,644 --> 01:06:22,354
- I know about a party tonight.
- Yeah?

1149
01:06:22,437 --> 01:06:23,437
Yeah.

1150
01:06:25,190 --> 01:06:28,569
Can you, um, can you share
this information?

1151
01:06:28,652 --> 01:06:30,487
Or is this some
top secret spy shit?

1152
01:06:30,571 --> 01:06:31,822
I can share, you got a phone?

1153
01:06:31,906 --> 01:06:33,156
No, no phone.

1154
01:06:33,448 --> 01:06:34,448
Oh.

1155
01:06:34,491 --> 01:06:35,701
Well...

1156
01:06:35,784 --> 01:06:38,161
Yes, I have a phone.

1157
01:06:51,174 --> 01:06:54,219
Okay, everything you need
is now in there.

1158
01:06:54,302 --> 01:06:55,136
Everything?

1159
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:58,766
No, nothing else at all
in the entire world, universe,

1160
01:06:58,849 --> 01:07:02,770
galaxy, manifest, destiny,
Louisiana Purchase be damned.

1161
01:07:03,228 --> 01:07:05,940
- Wow, that is everything,
- It is.

1162
01:07:06,774 --> 01:07:07,774
Vincent.

1163
01:07:12,696 --> 01:07:13,781
You got a name?

1164
01:07:18,702 --> 01:07:19,745
Uh-huh.

1165
01:07:24,124 --> 01:07:26,167
- That's a nice necklace.
- Mmm-hmm.

1166
01:07:27,252 --> 01:07:30,714
Thank you, nice guy.
Don't try to steal it.

1167
01:07:33,550 --> 01:07:36,052
Don't be a menace out there,
all right. Drive safe.

1168
01:07:42,392 --> 01:07:43,685
Roma.
