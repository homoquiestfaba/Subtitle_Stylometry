1
00:00:16,583 --> 00:00:19,177
All right, y'all, you're jammin' with Dr. D...

00:00:19,386 --> 00:00:21,980
on the number one station in Decatur,
Georgia.

3
00:00:22,122 --> 00:00:24,352
I want to see y'all down at my club...

4
00:00:24,591 --> 00:00:25,523
the Gold Tooth...

5
00:00:25,726 --> 00:00:28,786
the place to be on Saturday night
with Dr. D.

6
00:00:28,996 --> 00:00:30,623
Coming up next, we're going to give you...

00:00:30,898 --> 00:00:36,359
the 411 from MTV vj Idalis,
so stay where you're at.

8
00:00:56,790 --> 00:01:00,089
Why did you have to burn my toast, baby?

9
00:01:03,297 --> 00:01:06,323
Now, you know you said
you wanted everything well-done.

10
00:01:06,867 --> 00:01:08,596
And you know I didn't.

11
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:09,858
All right there, Nate.

12
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:18,605
Girl, don't pay him no mind.
He think he dolomite.

13
00:01:33,694 --> 00:01:34,786
What's good on the menu?

14
00:01:35,028 --> 00:01:35,926
Nothing.

15
00:01:36,096 --> 00:01:37,256
There you go, Nate.

16
00:01:37,865 --> 00:01:40,095
Just the way you like it.

17
00:01:42,936 --> 00:01:45,598
Hey, Georgia, this is Idalis from MTV...

18
00:01:45,806 --> 00:01:47,637
with a hot tip from you Southern gals.

19
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:51,107
Heavy D is looking for one special girl
who can dance...

20
00:01:51,278 --> 00:01:53,746
has a great spirit, and loves to travel...

21
00:01:53,914 --> 00:01:57,441
to be the video dance girl of the world
for his new video.

22
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:00,814
And get this, the lucky winner gets
$10,000 in cash.

23
00:02:01,021 --> 00:02:03,888
You heard that right.
Auditions are this week in L. A...

24
00:02:04,124 --> 00:02:04,988
So get a pen and paper...

25
00:02:05,125 --> 00:02:05,989
Nisi?

26
00:02:07,261 --> 00:02:08,353
You're daydreaming again.

27
00:02:08,528 --> 00:02:10,257
No, no, no, I was taking their order.

28
00:02:10,497 --> 00:02:12,294
Uh-uh. It's my second time
I done told you.

29
00:02:12,466 --> 00:02:14,400
I'm taking $10 out of your doggone pay.

30
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:17,170
Ohh, Mr. Johnson!

31
00:02:17,471 --> 00:02:18,597
Ohh!

32
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:20,402
$10?

33
00:02:20,607 --> 00:02:21,665
I don't want to hear nothing, Nisi.

34
00:02:21,975 --> 00:02:23,499
Not another word, another phrase,
another syllable.

35
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:24,938
Hey! Shut up!

36
00:02:25,412 --> 00:02:26,709
I'm the captain of this doggone ship.

37
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:29,414
If it's too hot in the kitchen, Nisi, leave.

38
00:02:29,816 --> 00:02:31,181
If the shoe fit, wear it.

39
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:32,442
If it too tight, take it off!

40
00:02:44,798 --> 00:02:47,198
I can't believe Ali and James
stand us up again.

41
00:02:47,401 --> 00:02:48,390
I'm through with them, girl.

42
00:02:48,602 --> 00:02:49,569
Now, you see what I mean?

43
00:02:49,803 --> 00:02:50,735
I ain't got nothing to lose.

44
00:02:50,904 --> 00:02:52,838
What you mean you ain't got
nothing to lose?

45
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,769
You talking about
using all the money we have...

46
00:02:54,975 --> 00:02:57,500
to go to some audition in California.

47
00:02:57,711 --> 00:02:59,178
Nisi, you ain't even a dancer.

48
00:02:59,346 --> 00:03:01,678
I am a dancer,
and I'll be dancin' my butt off...

49
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,244
for some $10,000.

50
00:03:03,417 --> 00:03:04,714
Now, if I get this job, Mick...

51
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:05,976
we're going to have
more than enough money...

52
00:03:06,253 --> 00:03:07,550
for the salon and the restaurant.

53
00:03:07,788 --> 00:03:08,720
You ain't using our life savings...

54
00:03:09,022 --> 00:03:10,512
to go to California on
some maybe mission.

55
00:03:10,857 --> 00:03:11,949
Your life is right here.

56
00:03:12,125 --> 00:03:13,456
We don't deserve this.

57
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:14,922
We deserve the best.

58
00:03:15,262 --> 00:03:16,422
That's why you got me.

59
00:03:16,997 --> 00:03:19,295
And you... You got me.

60
00:03:22,002 --> 00:03:23,833
Aw, come on, baby, I'm sorry I'm late...

61
00:03:24,037 --> 00:03:25,868
but, you know, sometimes
businessmen stuff can't wait.

62
00:03:26,073 --> 00:03:27,836
Well, you can just keep your '"Sorry'"...

63
00:03:28,041 --> 00:03:30,168
because you're a sorry excuse
for a boyfriend.

64
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:32,310
Hold on, hold on, hold on now.

65
00:03:32,546 --> 00:03:33,843
You ain't know why we late, girl.

66
00:03:34,147 --> 00:03:35,842
I don't know that y'all couldn't show up
here on time...

67
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:37,309
to walk us home from work.

68
00:03:37,651 --> 00:03:40,643
We've been checking out
this classic 1935 Ford...

69
00:03:40,887 --> 00:03:42,252
Eric's grandfather's selling.

70
00:03:42,522 --> 00:03:43,921
That's right, and he's gonna sell it to us...

71
00:03:44,491 --> 00:03:45,458
half the price.

72
00:03:45,625 --> 00:03:48,185
If he was giving it away,
it still wouldn't matter.

73
00:03:48,395 --> 00:03:50,056
Y'all ain't got no jobs.

74
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:51,727
We've been thinking about
putting applications in...

75
00:03:52,032 --> 00:03:52,828
for the last month, baby...

76
00:03:53,166 --> 00:03:54,633
but, you know,
the buses don't run everywhere.

77
00:03:54,935 --> 00:03:55,993
But, look here, we're gonna buy the car...

78
00:03:56,203 --> 00:03:57,568
and we're gonna start our own...

79
00:03:57,771 --> 00:04:00,831
page-a-cab luxury cab company.

80
00:04:01,675 --> 00:04:03,734
Oh, no. Come on, Mick.

81
00:04:03,944 --> 00:04:04,842
Bye.

82
00:04:05,312 --> 00:04:06,472
Hey, come on, come on.

83
00:04:06,747 --> 00:04:07,839
Nisi, why you act like that?

84
00:04:09,683 --> 00:04:11,412
Ali, I guess I'm tired...

85
00:04:11,585 --> 00:04:13,678
of hearing about all your pipe dreams.

86
00:04:14,621 --> 00:04:16,384
If you really cared about me...

87
00:04:16,556 --> 00:04:18,717
you would get rid of that tired perm...

88
00:04:18,925 --> 00:04:20,290
I've been telling you about forever.

89
00:04:20,494 --> 00:04:22,689
Oh, I don't cut my hair!
I ain't cutting the hair, no.

90
00:04:22,896 --> 00:04:24,261
If anything, I'm gonna bring
the perm back.

91
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:28,264
I was so mad, I just walked out.

92
00:04:28,502 --> 00:04:30,129
And he said that was his cousin?

93
00:04:30,404 --> 00:04:31,336
That's what he said.

94
00:04:33,974 --> 00:04:38,070
Bopping around here with that
cracked up perm he got.

95
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:39,479
You know he's wrong.

96
00:04:39,846 --> 00:04:42,371
Girl, why won't he let you cut his hair?

97
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:46,209
I don't know. I've been trying forever.

98
00:04:46,553 --> 00:04:47,986
Now, I'm a hairdresser, right?

99
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:49,621
And my man walking around here...

100
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,281
Iooking like a broke-down Superfly.

101
00:04:52,492 --> 00:04:54,824
No. No, Superfly's little brother.

102
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:56,622
Right, right. Superflea.

103
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:01,868
- Ow! - Be still then!

104
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:05,396
Shoot, you said you wanted
these pompoms, so you got 'em.

105
00:05:06,773 --> 00:05:08,206
Girl, we need to move on...

106
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:10,035
and we need to get us some new jobs.

107
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,575
Hey, what's up, kids?
Idalis kickin' it MTV style.

108
00:05:12,779 --> 00:05:14,804
Listen, y'all, I got the inside scoop...

109
00:05:15,015 --> 00:05:17,006
on the biggest video audition
to hit the airwaves...

110
00:05:17,217 --> 00:05:19,185
since the artist formerly
known as Prince...

111
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:21,078
was looking for that special girl
for his video...

112
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,321
The Most Beautiful Girl in the World.

113
00:05:22,489 --> 00:05:23,046
Remember that?

114
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:26,350
Well, Heavy D is doing
a unique video himself.

115
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:28,585
He's going to be shooting this video
all over the world...

116
00:05:28,829 --> 00:05:32,265
in beautiful, exotic places
like Brazil and Italy.

117
00:05:32,466 --> 00:05:34,798
He's looking for that oh, so special girl...

118
00:05:35,035 --> 00:05:37,128
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Go back.

119
00:05:37,304 --> 00:05:38,134
A great body, a great smile...

120
00:05:38,371 --> 00:05:39,929
and that twinkle in her eye.

121
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,969
He's looking for...

122
00:05:42,209 --> 00:05:43,176
- Look! - Huh?

123
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,241
So, that's the same audition!

124
00:05:45,812 --> 00:05:46,403
Girl?

125
00:05:46,613 --> 00:05:48,137
I think it's a sign from God.

126
00:05:48,315 --> 00:05:51,216
My mama always told me
good things come in 3.

127
00:05:51,451 --> 00:05:54,215
I heard it on the radio,
now read it in a magazine...

128
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:55,513
and now it's on TV!

129
00:05:55,689 --> 00:05:56,621
This is it, Mick!

130
00:05:57,824 --> 00:05:59,155
Nisi, you buggin'.

131
00:05:59,926 --> 00:06:00,893
But what if I ain't?

132
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:05,264
Come on, Mick. Let's go to L.A.

133
00:06:08,034 --> 00:06:09,126
Let's do it.

134
00:06:14,040 --> 00:06:15,632
Hell, yeah...

135
00:06:15,842 --> 00:06:19,801
'cause there ain't nothing
but some fine young rich men in L.A.

136
00:06:23,116 --> 00:06:25,050
I feel like partying right now. Come on.

137
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:28,785
Partying? We've got to try to
save every penny now.

138
00:06:29,289 --> 00:06:32,554
Uh-uh. It's Tuesday night.
You know what that means.

139
00:06:32,726 --> 00:06:35,058
Ladies night at the Gold Tooth.

140
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,422
We get in free!

141
00:06:37,364 --> 00:06:41,664
Go, go. Git it, git it.
Go, go. Git it, git it.

142
00:06:42,369 --> 00:06:44,735
I want everyone to have their I.D.s. Ready.

143
00:06:52,412 --> 00:06:53,606
It's just so ridiculous.

144
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:57,012
Everybody in here want to be a player,
pimp, hustler.

145
00:06:57,250 --> 00:06:58,114
Not me.

146
00:06:58,351 --> 00:07:00,979
I just want a simple woman.

147
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:02,951
That's you. I'm telling you it's you.

148
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:04,249
Oh, really?

149
00:07:04,624 --> 00:07:06,216
You're very special to me.

150
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,995
You see, I never met nobody like you
before in my life.

151
00:07:10,597 --> 00:07:12,588
Your name is etched in my heart.

152
00:07:13,233 --> 00:07:14,530
Shakima, right?

153
00:07:16,002 --> 00:07:17,060
Keesha?

154
00:07:17,304 --> 00:07:18,828
Mm-hmm...

155
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:21,667
I went to school with her.

156
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:23,431
All right, step forward.

157
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,486
Ooh, damn!

158
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,925
Fine and vivacious and beautiful.

159
00:07:47,167 --> 00:07:47,963
Y'all look gooda-than-a-mug!

160
00:07:48,168 --> 00:07:49,135
That's what he's trying to say.

161
00:07:49,436 --> 00:07:50,562
Thank you.

162
00:07:51,438 --> 00:07:53,599
Nisi, ain't you thirsty?

163
00:08:03,984 --> 00:08:08,114
Yeah, let me get 4 hurricanes, bro.

164
00:08:09,889 --> 00:08:12,323
Ooh, now, y'all look good
not like these hootchy girls.

165
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:13,490
Y'all got class.

166
00:08:13,827 --> 00:08:14,987
Like waitresses or something.

167
00:08:16,730 --> 00:08:18,527
That'll be $16 even.

168
00:08:30,844 --> 00:08:33,074
Hell, no. Let's go. I ain't thirsty.

169
00:08:33,313 --> 00:08:34,837
Come on, let's go to the bathroom.

170
00:08:38,084 --> 00:08:39,881
Hey, hey, hey, wait a minute.

171
00:08:40,053 --> 00:08:41,486
Hold it... hold it, girl.

172
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:43,379
Now, look, it was ladies night, right?

173
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:45,319
Y'all didn't have to pay to get in.
Y'all could have bought our drinks.

174
00:08:45,659 --> 00:08:46,717
Uh, not in this life.

175
00:08:46,993 --> 00:08:48,984
Now, hold on.
I ain't finished talking to you.

176
00:08:49,696 --> 00:08:52,460
Will you let go of her arm?
You ain't her damn daddy.

177
00:08:52,966 --> 00:08:55,161
Shut your ass up, you playa-hatin' heifer.

178
00:08:56,136 --> 00:08:57,228
Get off me.

179
00:08:57,437 --> 00:08:58,734
Hey, what you... what did I do?

180
00:08:59,406 --> 00:09:01,374
Oh, what you gonna do,
captain save-a-ho? Humm?

181
00:09:03,777 --> 00:09:04,937
Oh, no, it's on now, brother.

182
00:09:05,111 --> 00:09:05,941
Get on up!

183
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,704
I'll knock your ass back down again.

184
00:09:09,616 --> 00:09:10,480
Come on, here.

185
00:09:11,151 --> 00:09:13,210
I swallowed my gold tooth!

186
00:09:13,720 --> 00:09:16,018
Coming through here.

187
00:09:23,063 --> 00:09:24,963
Ladies, ladies, ladies.

188
00:09:31,237 --> 00:09:31,999
Hey, my man...

189
00:09:32,172 --> 00:09:34,140
let me hear 4 of them hurricanes, partner.

190
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,337
Oh, he good for it. They good for it.

191
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:47,980
That'll be $16 even.

192
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:56,625
Oh, hell, no! Come on, Mick.

193
00:09:56,863 --> 00:09:57,795
Come on, it's ladies night!

194
00:09:58,164 --> 00:09:59,461
- Nisi! - Y'all got in free.

195
00:10:00,533 --> 00:10:01,227
Nisi!

196
00:10:01,434 --> 00:10:01,923
What's your problem?

197
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:03,625
Why you treating me like some stepchild?

198
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:05,771
Because I deserve better than this, Ali.

199
00:10:05,939 --> 00:10:07,429
Don't you think I know that, baby?

200
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:09,537
I'm a businessman.
I'm trying to make things happen.

201
00:10:09,709 --> 00:10:11,700
You've been trying to
make things happen forever now.

202
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:13,310
You can't even keep a job.

203
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,640
I want a real man...

204
00:10:14,848 --> 00:10:18,306
a man with ambition, goals, real dreams.

205
00:10:18,718 --> 00:10:19,446
I got dreams.

206
00:10:19,619 --> 00:10:22,179
What you think my page-a-cab
luxury cab service is?

207
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,480
You ain't even got a driver's license.

208
00:10:35,969 --> 00:10:37,994
Like your dreams are just wired
for sound...

209
00:10:38,171 --> 00:10:39,502
and ready to roll, right?

210
00:10:39,806 --> 00:10:41,205
Owning a hair salon.

211
00:10:41,741 --> 00:10:43,936
That's you and Mickey's problem.

212
00:10:44,244 --> 00:10:45,836
You need to get a grip on life.

213
00:10:46,446 --> 00:10:47,777
I ain't never heard somebody
owning a restaurant...

214
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:48,708
with a hair salon in back.

215
00:10:49,048 --> 00:10:50,208
What kind of bullshit is that?

216
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:53,050
Oh... all right.

217
00:10:54,587 --> 00:10:56,077
Well, that's gonna happen.

218
00:10:56,489 --> 00:10:57,421
You'll see.

219
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:58,756
Nisi, Nisi, Nisi...

220
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:00,721
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

221
00:11:01,194 --> 00:11:03,424
Come on, baby.
They're playing our song.

222
00:11:05,131 --> 00:11:06,655
Used to be our song.

223
00:11:29,823 --> 00:11:32,087
Nisi, do you think you overdid it
with our hair?

224
00:11:32,926 --> 00:11:35,258
Mm-mmm. Nope.

225
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:39,965
I sure don't because
we're going to Beverly Hills.

226
00:11:40,166 --> 00:11:41,394
Now, if I'm going to do good
at that audition...

227
00:11:41,568 --> 00:11:43,126
we've got to look like stars.

228
00:11:47,540 --> 00:11:48,370
Nisi!

229
00:11:48,808 --> 00:11:49,900
- Nisi! - What, girl?

230
00:11:50,143 --> 00:11:51,872
Can't you see I'm trying to read up
on our manners?

231
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,312
I know, but we're going to need
more than manners...

232
00:11:54,514 --> 00:11:55,446
because right here it says...

233
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:58,216
that the rich and famous people
hang out at the Polo Lounge.

234
00:11:59,719 --> 00:12:00,481
So?

235
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:02,852
- So?! Oh, shit.

236
00:12:03,389 --> 00:12:05,687
We don't know nothin' about playing
no damn polo.

237
00:12:07,460 --> 00:12:08,449
Then look up in the book...

238
00:12:08,661 --> 00:12:12,358
and see if you can find
a basketball lounge.

239
00:12:13,066 --> 00:12:14,624
- Yeah! - Yeah!

240
00:12:16,169 --> 00:12:17,466
Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen.

241
00:12:17,670 --> 00:12:19,968
Our in-flight movie is about to begin.

242
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,640
Please lower your shade
if you're sitting next to a window.

243
00:12:22,775 --> 00:12:23,673
Thank you.

244
00:12:27,514 --> 00:12:30,142
- Where my thing at?
- Hey, I can't see.

245
00:12:30,316 --> 00:12:31,180
Miss?

246
00:12:31,918 --> 00:12:33,351
What's going on?

247
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:35,052
What's blocking the screen?

248
00:12:35,421 --> 00:12:38,254
- I paid money to see this.
- I can't see!

249
00:12:38,458 --> 00:12:39,447
Please, can I have another seat?

250
00:12:39,626 --> 00:12:40,888
I'll pay you any amount of money.

251
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:43,162
I'm sorry. The flight is all booked up.

252
00:12:43,463 --> 00:12:44,555
Aw, fuck!

253
00:12:45,698 --> 00:12:46,722
Hello?

254
00:12:47,901 --> 00:12:51,803
Ladies, would you mind
lowering your hair?

255
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:54,098
No problem.

256
00:12:56,676 --> 00:12:57,700
It's beautiful.

257
00:12:59,946 --> 00:13:02,540
Maybe you overdid it just a little bit.

258
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,181
Maybe I did, huh?

259
00:13:05,051 --> 00:13:07,042
Can I get my money back
for these headphones?

260
00:13:07,687 --> 00:13:09,177
Oh, there, there. That's much better.

261
00:13:09,622 --> 00:13:12,591
The white zone is for
the immediate loading and unloading...

262
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,900
Oh, shit, lady, look!

263
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:29,172
Nis, look!

264
00:13:29,375 --> 00:13:33,072
- LL! LL! - LL! LL!

265
00:13:33,813 --> 00:13:35,542
Damn! Lady love in the flesh!

266
00:13:35,748 --> 00:13:38,046
Ain't nothing like a brother
who practices what he preaches.

267
00:13:38,351 --> 00:13:40,615
Remember we read in
right on magazine...

268
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:41,844
he done married his baby's mama!

269
00:13:42,055 --> 00:13:44,046
- Sure did!
- You're a good man, too.

270
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:45,622
I know that hoochie's been
throwing that ass at you, too.

271
00:13:45,858 --> 00:13:47,723
I know! Remember when tit-tit said
she slept with him?

272
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:49,622
Precious, too!
She said he got it goin' on!

273
00:13:49,929 --> 00:13:50,827
She sure did!

274
00:13:50,997 --> 00:13:54,398
Ladies, ladies, ladies, it's nice to
meet y'all, but I got to go to the studio.

275
00:13:54,667 --> 00:13:55,429
OK. LL!

276
00:13:55,635 --> 00:13:57,796
I'm gonna be in the Heavy D video!
I'm about to blow up!

277
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,028
Boo yeah! She is!

278
00:13:59,205 --> 00:14:01,105
Well, check it out.
I don't mean to be rude or anything...

279
00:14:01,307 --> 00:14:03,138
but, unfortunately, I gotta go.
I'm running late, OK?

280
00:14:03,343 --> 00:14:04,970
OK, uncle L. OK.

281
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:08,013
- OK, baby.
- Keep licking them lips!

282
00:14:08,081 --> 00:14:10,242
Oh, and I know you're with
your baby's mama...

283
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:12,918
but if the shit don't work out
you know you can come...

284
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:16,451
Girl! Let's go get our luggage! Go!

285
00:14:20,827 --> 00:14:22,852
Girl, you said good things come in 3s.

286
00:14:23,062 --> 00:14:24,529
That's sure what my mama said.

287
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:27,325
Ow! If I see LL 2 more times, it's on!

288
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:30,697
Come on! We just saw LL!
Ring my bell!

289
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,013
We're the first ones here.

290
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,349
For real? You're about to get his job, girl!

291
00:14:51,524 --> 00:14:52,752
You're gonna get this!

292
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:06,301
Will number 865 please step up?

293
00:15:06,839 --> 00:15:10,570
Will number 865
please join the group over there?

294
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:16,212
Oh, girl, I'm gonna blow this audition up!

295
00:15:16,416 --> 00:15:18,281
You got to, 'cause we only have
enough money...

296
00:15:18,518 --> 00:15:20,247
for one night in a motel room.

297
00:15:20,553 --> 00:15:22,783
I'm gonna get this. Get this.

298
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:26,024
Oh, look at her trying to show out.

299
00:15:26,359 --> 00:15:27,451
Come on. Mm-hmm.

300
00:15:27,694 --> 00:15:29,753
She thinks she got it going on.

301
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:31,122
You the bomb.

302
00:15:33,032 --> 00:15:34,397
- Oh, yeah. - I got this.

303
00:15:34,667 --> 00:15:35,861
No problem.

304
00:15:36,903 --> 00:15:38,131
Eww, she wrong for that.

305
00:15:38,404 --> 00:15:40,065
Uh, uh, that was good...

306
00:15:40,273 --> 00:15:43,174
but you might want to go on home now
'cause I'm here.

307
00:15:43,342 --> 00:15:45,970
No, stay, 'cause we're going to need
a few extras in the video.

308
00:15:47,313 --> 00:15:48,177
Excuse me.

309
00:16:24,083 --> 00:16:26,950
That's my girl! That's my girl!

310
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:29,488
Yeah. Yeah!

311
00:16:30,089 --> 00:16:31,716
Baby, we got this!

312
00:16:37,396 --> 00:16:40,422
Girl, can you believe he gonna accuse
me of hitting everybody with my hair?

313
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,059
I didn't hit nobody with my hair.

314
00:16:42,235 --> 00:16:43,463
I did hit a few of them, though...

315
00:16:43,636 --> 00:16:46,127
because I was rooting for you.
I wanted you to win.

316
00:16:46,405 --> 00:16:48,168
I ain't like that song no way.

317
00:16:49,375 --> 00:16:54,312
Come on, let's just find a hotel
so we can get out of here in the morning.

318
00:16:54,514 --> 00:16:56,948
Where are we going to find a taxi
around here anyway?

319
00:16:57,884 --> 00:17:01,752
Excuse me. Excuse me.

320
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:08,386
I couldn't help to notice you earlier.
You are a very good dancer.

321
00:17:08,928 --> 00:17:11,294
Uh-huh. Well, they ain't think so.

322
00:17:12,198 --> 00:17:14,098
My boss is doing a music video.

323
00:17:14,267 --> 00:17:15,996
I thought you'd be perfect for it.

324
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,031
Hold up. How many C-notes
we talking here?

325
00:17:19,872 --> 00:17:21,339
Uh, C-notes?

326
00:17:21,674 --> 00:17:22,902
Cash money?

327
00:17:25,344 --> 00:17:27,175
Room and board
in his Beverly Hills mansion...

328
00:17:27,346 --> 00:17:28,813
and $10,000.

329
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,316
- A mansion? - $10,000?

330
00:17:32,752 --> 00:17:33,719
Where he at?

331
00:17:35,688 --> 00:17:36,712
Follow me.

332
00:18:25,805 --> 00:18:28,171
Come on, girl.
We got to take care of business.

333
00:18:43,256 --> 00:18:45,224
Wait, wait, wait! Don't!
Don't ring the doorbell yet.

334
00:18:45,358 --> 00:18:48,122
It say right here in my etiquette notes...

335
00:18:48,628 --> 00:18:51,563
that if they say, '"How are you? '" We say...

336
00:18:51,731 --> 00:18:54,393
Livin' large and takin' charge, big boy!

337
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:56,329
I don't want you doing that kind of stuff.

338
00:18:56,502 --> 00:18:58,094
We're in Beverly Hills...

339
00:18:58,170 --> 00:19:00,263
so when they say, '"How are you,'"

340
00:19:00,439 --> 00:19:01,997
We smile sweetly...

341
00:19:03,976 --> 00:19:07,275
And said, '"Very well, thank you.
And yourself? '"

342
00:19:08,247 --> 00:19:09,305
You cool?

343
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:10,781
Ring the doorbell.

344
00:19:25,264 --> 00:19:27,630
How did you get past security
at the gate?

345
00:19:28,267 --> 00:19:31,134
Begging is not permitted in Beverly Hills.

346
00:19:31,704 --> 00:19:33,194
Oh, well, that's cool,
because where we come from.

347
00:19:33,472 --> 00:19:34,769
Crackheads be beggin' all the time.

348
00:19:35,174 --> 00:19:38,337
Snap! We can't even
walk down the street...

349
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:41,379
Oh, no, see, it's on!

350
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:43,777
- It's on now in Beverly Hills!
- Mick, we're not doin' no fighting...

351
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:45,144
Ladies, welcome.

352
00:19:46,319 --> 00:19:48,810
I'm Isaac Blakemore, and you are?

353
00:19:49,188 --> 00:19:51,383
I'm Denise, and this is my friend Tamika.

354
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:54,583
You can just call me Nisi and her Mickey.

355
00:20:01,233 --> 00:20:03,098
Uh, sorry. Please, come on in.

356
00:20:03,302 --> 00:20:05,133
I'm sorry. How very rude of me.

357
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:08,869
I just have to finish up
a phone conversation.

358
00:20:10,276 --> 00:20:12,107
You know, just looking at you...

359
00:20:12,311 --> 00:20:15,803
I can tell you're exactly
what I've been looking for.

360
00:20:19,352 --> 00:20:20,444
So, I got the job?

361
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:24,146
Well, yeah. It certainly seems that way,
doesn't it?

362
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:28,583
Well, Manley here will be happy
to show you up to your room.

363
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:30,695
You can just relax, you know,
freshen up a little bit.

364
00:20:30,930 --> 00:20:33,364
Just make yourself at home,
then we'll meet again shortly...

365
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,796
to go over the terms of your contract.

366
00:20:36,302 --> 00:20:37,360
Thank you.

367
00:20:37,703 --> 00:20:39,603
Oh, good. Good, good, good.

368
00:20:40,206 --> 00:20:41,195
I'll see you in a bit.

369
00:20:42,842 --> 00:20:44,901
Thank you. Thank you.

370
00:20:52,985 --> 00:20:53,974
Follow me.

371
00:21:09,735 --> 00:21:10,759
Mickey, look!

372
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:14,131
Ooh, he got a little one!

373
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:38,690
Ooh, look! Check this out!

374
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:40,590
It's a real famous piece.

375
00:21:40,800 --> 00:21:42,165
They done pay crazy cash for this.

376
00:21:42,368 --> 00:21:43,392
For that?

377
00:21:43,602 --> 00:21:45,968
Some ugly woman he tried to hook up?

378
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,436
If she was ugly,
he should have left her ugly.

379
00:21:49,842 --> 00:21:53,107
She look like Loquisha Jenkins
with a bad hair weave.

380
00:21:55,681 --> 00:21:57,945
You need some throat lozenges
or something?

381
00:21:58,284 --> 00:21:59,649
Lead the way, Alfred.

382
00:21:59,952 --> 00:22:02,079
The name is Mr. Manley.

383
00:22:02,288 --> 00:22:04,950
Manley will do very nicely, thank you.

384
00:22:06,625 --> 00:22:07,614
Who is Alfred?

385
00:22:08,260 --> 00:22:10,820
You know. Batman's homeboy.

386
00:22:11,030 --> 00:22:13,521
Oh, you right, girl.
I see what you're saying.

387
00:22:13,833 --> 00:22:16,631
You would be so good in the sequel!

388
00:22:16,869 --> 00:22:18,393
- Oh, he'd be phat! - He would!

389
00:22:21,173 --> 00:22:23,573
And you'd have to do is say,
'"Batman to the cave! '"

390
00:22:23,776 --> 00:22:25,437
And everybody would
lose their job that day.

391
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:26,908
And you'd get that job!

392
00:22:27,546 --> 00:22:29,138
To the batcave!

393
00:22:30,382 --> 00:22:31,280
Ask him to say it, Mick.

394
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:33,247
You do it. I already called the man Alfred.

395
00:22:33,486 --> 00:22:34,043
Oh, come on.

396
00:22:34,253 --> 00:22:36,118
No, I just want to know
where we're sleeping tonight.

397
00:22:37,022 --> 00:22:37,716
Hi.

398
00:22:40,526 --> 00:22:41,823
Wait in there.

399
00:22:43,529 --> 00:22:45,019
What kind of welcome is that?

400
00:22:45,297 --> 00:22:46,787
- Wait in there. - Come on.

401
00:23:04,517 --> 00:23:06,883
Mick! Come in here. Look at this.

402
00:23:10,022 --> 00:23:11,387
Ooh, it's pretty, ain't it?

403
00:23:11,624 --> 00:23:13,114
It's beautiful.

404
00:23:18,964 --> 00:23:20,056
Hey...

405
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:21,799
Why they got 2 toilets?

406
00:23:23,836 --> 00:23:25,201
You know how rich folks is.

407
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:28,635
They got to feel like they got a choice
in everything they do.

408
00:23:29,041 --> 00:23:29,871
Now, that one right there...

409
00:23:30,142 --> 00:23:31,541
Iook like it's for number one...

410
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:34,676
And that one look like it's for number 2.

411
00:23:35,648 --> 00:23:37,445
How do you flush number one?

412
00:23:40,085 --> 00:23:42,952
You just turn these 2 handles right here.

413
00:23:46,792 --> 00:23:48,225
Oh, no, girl!

414
00:23:48,994 --> 00:23:50,461
What did you do?

415
00:23:51,263 --> 00:23:52,958
The water's getting all over the floor!

416
00:23:53,132 --> 00:23:54,963
Do something! Hurry!

417
00:23:55,134 --> 00:23:56,123
I'm trying!

418
00:23:56,335 --> 00:23:59,566
Turn it off, Nisi! Turn it off! Turn it off!

419
00:24:00,306 --> 00:24:02,900
- Nis, let me! - OK!

420
00:24:07,580 --> 00:24:08,604
I'm gonna turn it off!

421
00:24:08,781 --> 00:24:10,043
Mick, sit on it! Sit on it, Mick!

422
00:24:10,216 --> 00:24:12,047
They're gonna throw us out of here, Mick!

423
00:24:12,251 --> 00:24:14,913
Come on! Come on! OK! OK!

424
00:24:15,154 --> 00:24:17,418
Girl, that's my back!
Girl, that's my back!

425
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:20,790
Girl, you're on my back!
You're on my back, girl!

426
00:24:21,026 --> 00:24:22,015
Come on now!

427
00:24:22,861 --> 00:24:24,590
Is everything all right in there?

428
00:24:26,599 --> 00:24:29,693
- I say, is everything all right in there?
- Mick, the intercom!

429
00:24:30,135 --> 00:24:31,067
Hurry up, girl!

430
00:24:32,104 --> 00:24:33,128
Come on now!

431
00:24:34,873 --> 00:24:36,932
Hello? Hello, ladies?

432
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:39,910
C'mon, shit!

433
00:24:41,313 --> 00:24:43,178
Are you all right in there?

434
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,076
Damn! Talk to the man!

435
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:49,045
Is everything all right in there?

436
00:24:49,221 --> 00:24:51,519
Yes... everything is fine.

437
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,554
Have you got a mop?

438
00:24:52,925 --> 00:24:54,756
Mr. Isaac will see you now.

439
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:58,025
Mm-hmm. We'll be down in 5 minutes.

440
00:24:58,197 --> 00:24:59,164
5 hours!

441
00:24:59,465 --> 00:25:00,432
Shut up, Mick!

442
00:25:09,041 --> 00:25:10,167
Together.

443
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:17,504
Over here.

444
00:25:26,592 --> 00:25:28,719
Wait, wait. Slow down. Slow down.

445
00:25:29,228 --> 00:25:30,354
I don't want you to trip.

446
00:25:31,664 --> 00:25:33,859
Hi. Please have a seat.

447
00:25:35,301 --> 00:25:36,268
How do you like your room?

448
00:25:36,468 --> 00:25:39,369
Oh, snap! This whole place is the bomb!

449
00:25:40,406 --> 00:25:41,532
It's lovely.

450
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:44,065
Now, uh, before we begin...

451
00:25:44,610 --> 00:25:47,977
well, there's just one little thing
I have to tell you.

452
00:25:48,881 --> 00:25:51,372
I'm not making a music video.

453
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:55,681
I just didn't know how else
I was going to find...

454
00:25:56,155 --> 00:25:58,817
an actress like yourself.

455
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:03,318
I can act, too!

456
00:26:04,163 --> 00:26:05,994
This job involves...

457
00:26:06,965 --> 00:26:09,900
And old man who is dying from cancer.

458
00:26:10,069 --> 00:26:12,128
Oh, that's sad.

459
00:26:12,571 --> 00:26:13,936
Know what's even sadder?

460
00:26:15,607 --> 00:26:18,235
He was never able to marry...

461
00:26:18,410 --> 00:26:20,605
the one woman that he truly loved.

462
00:26:21,747 --> 00:26:23,078
Why come?

463
00:26:24,016 --> 00:26:26,246
Because he's white...

464
00:26:27,653 --> 00:26:29,621
and she was black.

465
00:26:30,189 --> 00:26:32,680
She was the housekeeper
at the family's estate.

466
00:26:32,891 --> 00:26:34,119
Her name was Lily.

467
00:26:34,460 --> 00:26:37,224
- Oh, that's who I'm going to play?
- Well, not quite.

468
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:44,867
When his family
discovered their relationship...

469
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,503
they separated them.

470
00:26:46,739 --> 00:26:50,766
They immediately married him off
to a white woman.

471
00:26:51,944 --> 00:26:54,208
And he never saw Lily again.

472
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,976
Anyway, he's dying...

473
00:26:58,183 --> 00:27:01,516
and the only family that he has left
is his nephew.

474
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:04,178
That's me.
Sorry. I'm his nephew.

475
00:27:04,590 --> 00:27:06,057
Uh, and when I learned...

476
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:08,851
that he has less than 2 weeks to live...

477
00:27:09,428 --> 00:27:14,889
well, I decided that maybe I should try
and find the love of his life. Find Lily.

478
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:16,959
That is so sweet of you.

479
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:19,603
Well, it was also impossible.

480
00:27:20,005 --> 00:27:24,271
But, seems I have managed to find...

481
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,138
Lily's granddaughter.

482
00:27:29,181 --> 00:27:32,981
- Oh, that's who I'm going to play.
- Yes. Yes, exactly.

483
00:27:33,118 --> 00:27:34,415
Well, my idea was...

484
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,248
You know how much
your grandmother loved him...

485
00:27:38,457 --> 00:27:40,118
so, you show up here...

486
00:27:40,325 --> 00:27:41,587
out of the goodness of your heart.

487
00:27:41,794 --> 00:27:44,422
You just do anything and everything
that you can...

488
00:27:44,563 --> 00:27:45,996
to make sure that his final days...

489
00:27:46,265 --> 00:27:50,292
are filled with... with kindness and love.

490
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:55,238
- Bravo. - Man.

491
00:27:55,407 --> 00:27:58,205
- That's beautiful.
- Aw, I'm glad you think so.

492
00:27:58,444 --> 00:28:02,039
So, if you'd be so kind as to follow me.

493
00:28:03,382 --> 00:28:04,371
Right this way.

494
00:28:21,867 --> 00:28:24,335
Uncle Don, I have a surprise for you.

495
00:28:24,570 --> 00:28:27,664
I'd like you to meet Denise.

496
00:28:28,841 --> 00:28:32,038
Denise is Lily's granddaughter.

497
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:41,979
Why didn't you tell me they were coming?

498
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:46,256
How dare you bring them in like this.

499
00:28:46,492 --> 00:28:47,652
How dare you!

500
00:28:51,597 --> 00:28:52,325
No.

501
00:28:52,498 --> 00:28:55,058
Put... get... get out. Get out.

502
00:29:01,974 --> 00:29:03,441
Nisi, let's not get scared.

503
00:29:03,642 --> 00:29:05,109
We can handle that old man.

504
00:29:05,310 --> 00:29:08,837
We gonna get this $10,000
and make all our dreams come true.

505
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:12,143
Oh, my goodness.

506
00:29:14,219 --> 00:29:15,709
Oh, my god.

507
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:17,719
This is the bomb.

508
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,115
It's the bomb.

509
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,559
OK.

510
00:29:23,061 --> 00:29:24,187
We going to get this money.

511
00:29:24,396 --> 00:29:25,363
Let's go to dinner.

512
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:26,792
He said it was this way.

513
00:29:27,032 --> 00:29:28,021
Come on!

514
00:29:28,734 --> 00:29:31,532
I'm sorry I scared you.
I meant it as a surprise.

515
00:29:31,737 --> 00:29:35,366
It's all right, Isaac.
Just don't ever do that to me again.

516
00:29:35,674 --> 00:29:37,005
I won't.

517
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:41,471
Well, hello there.

518
00:29:42,614 --> 00:29:43,876
Have a seat.

519
00:29:59,565 --> 00:30:01,624
Forgive me for my behavior earlier.

520
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,994
I'm sorry if I was rude.

521
00:30:03,201 --> 00:30:06,170
I... I don't like surprises.

522
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,432
So...

523
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:13,242
I can't tell you how happy I am
to have you in my home.

524
00:30:14,146 --> 00:30:18,014
The first years of my life were touched
by the magic of Lily.

525
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:20,916
I welcome you.

526
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:24,522
I suppose she told you all about life
on the estate.

527
00:30:30,829 --> 00:30:32,387
Yeah, she did.

528
00:30:32,664 --> 00:30:34,291
What exactly did she say?

529
00:30:36,768 --> 00:30:47,042
Uh, well, she... told me about the trees.

530
00:30:47,245 --> 00:30:49,179
There were wonderful trees.

531
00:30:49,381 --> 00:30:53,283
There was this beautiful, majestic oak
as you drove...

532
00:30:53,485 --> 00:30:54,713
That's the one. The oak.

533
00:30:54,953 --> 00:30:56,386
She told us about the oak, didn't she?

534
00:30:59,558 --> 00:31:00,786
Ah, here's dinner.

535
00:31:07,499 --> 00:31:08,193
Thanks.

536
00:31:11,003 --> 00:31:12,197
Thank you, Manley.

537
00:31:18,010 --> 00:31:19,170
What's this?

538
00:31:19,378 --> 00:31:21,778
I'm only permitted to eat certain foods.

539
00:31:22,347 --> 00:31:24,144
No wonder why you sick.

540
00:31:25,217 --> 00:31:28,482
I don't mean to be rude,
but you ain't dead yet.

541
00:31:28,920 --> 00:31:30,820
You can still eat hearty.

542
00:31:33,892 --> 00:31:34,756
What she mean is...

543
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:37,053
you can still eat hearty
and be healthy, too.

544
00:31:37,663 --> 00:31:39,255
You sound just like Lily.

545
00:31:41,033 --> 00:31:43,024
There's no food like soul food.

546
00:31:43,201 --> 00:31:44,065
You right about that.

547
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:46,363
Ain't no food like soul food. Excuse me.

548
00:31:47,239 --> 00:31:48,797
- Give me your plate. - What?

549
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:50,334
Give me your plate.

550
00:32:52,704 --> 00:32:53,762
Yes.

551
00:33:08,420 --> 00:33:10,479
92.3 The Beat with Jesse Collins.

552
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:12,316
Off the request lines from L.A.

553
00:33:14,292 --> 00:33:16,351
Do you think Ali and James miss us?

554
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:19,224
I don't know, but I know I miss my man.

555
00:33:19,698 --> 00:33:21,461
You need to scoot over,
because I ain't got no problem...

556
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,362
sleeping on this expensive white carpet
because I know it's poodle hair.

557
00:33:27,005 --> 00:33:28,029
Excuse me.

558
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:30,202
I must talk to you.

559
00:33:30,942 --> 00:33:33,467
Oh, yes, Antonio! I'm coming!

560
00:33:33,845 --> 00:33:34,709
Hold on.

561
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:38,745
- Antonio. - Mickey.

562
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:41,245
- Antonio. - Mickey.

563
00:33:48,059 --> 00:33:50,527
Perhaps we can go someplace private.

564
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,257
Hold on.

565
00:33:53,732 --> 00:33:56,826
You need to go take a cold shower
like I told you to.

566
00:33:58,403 --> 00:34:00,200
Come with me, bellissima.

567
00:34:09,948 --> 00:34:12,610
Hey, hey!
You said we came down here to talk.

568
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:14,008
No more lies.

569
00:34:14,152 --> 00:34:17,178
I felt that maybe you were feeling
the same thing that I feel for you.

570
00:34:17,355 --> 00:34:18,413
You were?

571
00:34:18,957 --> 00:34:20,788
We are destiny, I'm convinced.

572
00:34:20,959 --> 00:34:23,519
- We are? - Si, bellissima.

573
00:34:24,863 --> 00:34:26,490
But I have a secret.

574
00:34:29,401 --> 00:34:32,461
Well, got on ahead, Antonio.
You can tell me.

575
00:34:33,405 --> 00:34:35,202
My family is very wealthy.

576
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:38,370
For real?

577
00:34:39,945 --> 00:34:43,073
I came to America to find somebody
who likes me for me.

578
00:34:43,815 --> 00:34:45,373
Somebody like you.

579
00:34:45,617 --> 00:34:47,346
You got some money?

580
00:34:48,887 --> 00:34:51,913
More money than you can spend
in one lifetime.

581
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:55,217
Oh, please let me try
in this lifetime, please.

582
00:34:55,393 --> 00:34:57,452
I will. I promise.

583
00:34:58,196 --> 00:34:59,720
I need to go now.

584
00:35:00,098 --> 00:35:01,565
Until we meet again.

585
00:35:07,405 --> 00:35:08,963
Arrivederci.

586
00:35:11,977 --> 00:35:14,070
Aria derchi to you, too.

587
00:35:14,279 --> 00:35:16,907
And some mozzarella and fettuccini.

588
00:35:18,016 --> 00:35:19,347
Hell, yeah.

589
00:35:25,390 --> 00:35:27,415
I swear to God it ain't no dream.

590
00:35:27,626 --> 00:35:30,493
I know you think he's just hired help
but it's all an act.

591
00:35:30,695 --> 00:35:32,128
Well, if he's so rich...

592
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:36,700
why did he have to come
all the way to America to find his wife?

593
00:35:37,002 --> 00:35:38,094
I don't know.

594
00:35:38,370 --> 00:35:40,065
But I ain't got no rock on my finger...

595
00:35:40,238 --> 00:35:42,468
so I say we keep shopping
for our babies' daddies.

596
00:35:42,674 --> 00:35:44,369
And may the fattest wallet him.

597
00:35:44,609 --> 00:35:48,409
I tell you, Master Isaac,
they're disrupting M. Blakemore's diet.

598
00:35:48,580 --> 00:35:52,243
They're poisoning him
with this soul food as he calls it.

599
00:35:52,450 --> 00:35:53,883
Mm-mmm, he love Mickey's soul food.

600
00:35:54,052 --> 00:35:56,953
My soul food is created
to nourish the soul, OK?

601
00:35:57,222 --> 00:35:59,247
I ain't used pork
since Thelma was on Good Times...

602
00:35:59,457 --> 00:36:01,084
about to marry Ebay the African prince,

603
00:36:01,259 --> 00:36:03,352
'cause he didn't eat pork in his food
and I said no, no, no.

604
00:36:03,561 --> 00:36:04,323
I'm waiting on my African prince...

605
00:36:04,629 --> 00:36:06,722
to be my baby's daddy,
so I stopped using pork...

606
00:36:06,965 --> 00:36:09,126
because I started using chicken broth.
I could be doing that.

607
00:36:09,301 --> 00:36:10,893
So I don't know what you talking about.

608
00:36:11,102 --> 00:36:15,163
See, what I cook is much healthier than
that bird stuff Alfred is cooking for him.

609
00:36:15,473 --> 00:36:16,667
The name is Manley, thank you.

610
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:18,570
I spoke with the nutritionist this morning.

611
00:36:18,777 --> 00:36:22,543
And he warned me that
this so-called soul food...

612
00:36:22,747 --> 00:36:25,011
has been know to clog the arteries,
cramp the colon...

613
00:36:25,283 --> 00:36:27,274
and eventually stop the heart.

614
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:28,452
Is that true?

615
00:36:28,653 --> 00:36:30,018
Mm-mmm, not the way she do it.

616
00:36:30,221 --> 00:36:33,384
- Good grief, would you look at that?
- Yes.

617
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:36,156
Let me have that from you.

618
00:36:36,761 --> 00:36:39,127
You're alarming me a little bit.
I want you to relax.

619
00:36:40,031 --> 00:36:41,396
I think you're overreacting.

620
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:44,432
Ladies, I want you to continue to cook...

621
00:36:44,636 --> 00:36:46,570
whatever you think is going to
make my uncle happy.

622
00:36:46,771 --> 00:36:48,762
And if there's anything else you need
from the store...

623
00:36:49,007 --> 00:36:52,807
well, I'm sure that Manley will be
more than delighted to go get it for you.

624
00:36:53,011 --> 00:36:54,569
Oh, you think he could go
by the record store?

625
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:55,507
Oh, sure.

626
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:58,011
And don't forget my Ice Cube cd, Manley.

627
00:36:58,216 --> 00:37:00,616
Good morning, everybody.
How are you? Isaac, good to see you.

628
00:37:01,186 --> 00:37:04,087
Ah, I don't know
what you put in that meal last night...

629
00:37:04,356 --> 00:37:06,256
but I feel great.

630
00:37:06,458 --> 00:37:07,322
Excuse me.

631
00:37:13,331 --> 00:37:14,491
What's for breakfast?

632
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:42,791
Excuse me.

633
00:37:47,399 --> 00:37:48,093
Excuse me, please.

634
00:37:48,333 --> 00:37:49,630
I wonder if you could help me.

635
00:37:50,201 --> 00:37:52,999
Oh, yeah, yeah. You're looking for the
classical section, back there by the jazz.

636
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:56,334
No, no, no, no.
I am not looking for the classical section.

637
00:37:56,608 --> 00:37:59,372
I'm looking for the rap section as follows:

638
00:37:59,644 --> 00:38:01,475
2 Pac, Too Short, the Dogg Pound...

639
00:38:01,679 --> 00:38:04,477
Ice Cube, Ice T,
Bitch Betta Have My Money...

640
00:38:04,682 --> 00:38:06,274
and Pull Up to the Bumper, Baby.

641
00:38:06,584 --> 00:38:09,747
All right, right, right.
OK, you trying to get your groove on.

642
00:38:09,921 --> 00:38:11,081
Right this way, dog.

643
00:38:11,756 --> 00:38:14,782
Got that Too Short player's style
right there. Yeah.

644
00:38:14,959 --> 00:38:17,154
What else? We got that Mack 10,
baby, yeah.

645
00:38:17,429 --> 00:38:18,361
West Side!

646
00:38:19,497 --> 00:38:20,464
Yeah, what you know about that?

647
00:38:20,698 --> 00:38:22,666
Got that east coast Busta Rhymes
in the house.

648
00:38:22,867 --> 00:38:24,027
What you know, boy?

649
00:38:26,571 --> 00:38:27,936
Yeah, what else we got here?

650
00:38:28,273 --> 00:38:29,706
An, got that Miami Bass, baby.

651
00:38:29,908 --> 00:38:31,773
What you know about
that Luke Skywalker, huh?

652
00:38:31,976 --> 00:38:35,377
Uhh-uhh, get it, get it
Get it, get it

653
00:38:37,082 --> 00:38:37,548
Check it out.

654
00:38:37,816 --> 00:38:39,010
We got the bomb in the back, though.

655
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:42,017
- Hey, you know Dre left Death Row, right?
- What?

656
00:38:48,793 --> 00:38:50,385
Now who's got the ball?

657
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:51,686
I hear you.

658
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:55,457
Ah ah, I got the ball now.

659
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,039
You can't shoot from there.

660
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:07,709
My shot!

661
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:10,843
- Mr. B shoots. - 2, chalk upo 2!

662
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:15,913
- Tie score. - I shot 2.

663
00:39:16,121 --> 00:39:17,315
4 seconds, 3 seconds.

664
00:39:17,856 --> 00:39:19,016
Here we go around.

665
00:39:21,993 --> 00:39:23,358
Mickey.

666
00:39:24,295 --> 00:39:25,125
You all right?

667
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,056
My hair.

668
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:33,402
My hair got wet! Oh, God!

669
00:39:35,206 --> 00:39:36,230
Mickey!

670
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:38,664
Mickey!

671
00:39:40,411 --> 00:39:43,380
I told that girl
she should wear a swimming cap!

672
00:39:43,615 --> 00:39:44,582
What's the problem?

673
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:46,646
Nothing.

674
00:39:46,851 --> 00:39:48,216
She done got her hair wet.

675
00:39:48,553 --> 00:39:51,113
Now she's mad
because she going to be nappy.

676
00:39:51,890 --> 00:39:53,687
I tell you what, send for the car...

677
00:39:53,858 --> 00:39:55,587
and make an appointment
at a hair salon I know.

678
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,194
Have them call me
and charge it to my account.

679
00:39:58,930 --> 00:40:00,625
Wait, I got a better idea.

680
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:02,664
I can use some new clothes.

681
00:40:02,867 --> 00:40:05,233
What say we... we go on
a shopping spree?

682
00:40:05,904 --> 00:40:07,132
A shopping spree?

683
00:40:08,506 --> 00:40:10,872
Today must be my lucky day!

684
00:40:12,377 --> 00:40:13,708
I'm going on a shopping spree.

685
00:40:13,912 --> 00:40:15,277
I never been on a shopping spree.

686
00:40:15,713 --> 00:40:17,408
I'm going on a shopping spree!

687
00:41:49,874 --> 00:41:51,899
I... yeah, yeah, yeah.

688
00:41:52,744 --> 00:41:54,075
Would you relax?

689
00:41:54,345 --> 00:41:55,403
Relax.

690
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:57,945
Stop worrying about those girls.

691
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:01,278
Because they're idiots.

692
00:42:01,486 --> 00:42:03,579
They're not going to suspect anything.

693
00:42:03,788 --> 00:42:05,085
No, they won't.

694
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:06,689
Look... look, all you have to do...

695
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:07,948
just be set up on your end.

696
00:42:08,159 --> 00:42:09,626
Everything's going to be fine.

697
00:42:09,994 --> 00:42:11,621
Because I know it will.

698
00:42:12,497 --> 00:42:14,761
I already have all the pictures
I'm going to need.

699
00:42:16,367 --> 00:42:18,392
Just get a grip on yourself.

700
00:42:19,470 --> 00:42:23,201
You're going to be very wealthy

00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:34,306
I know. It was the housekeeper.

720
00:43:34,545 --> 00:43:36,274
No, it was the stepdaughter

That Jillian.

724
00:43:41,886 --> 00:43:44,354
She is a nasty piece of work, isn't she?

Who killed Adam's wife?

731
00:43:57,435 --> 00:44:00,199
It was that dirty,
rotten swine Dr. Matthew.

732
00:44:00,371 --> 00:44:02,271
I always did suspect him.

733
00:44:03,307 --> 00:44:05,969

00:45:56,787 --> 00:45:57,412
Wait a minute.

00:45:57,688 --> 00:46:00,350
Ain't you that girl that hit the other girl

00:46:09,333 --> 00:46:11,062
No, she can dance.
And I'm the next Monifa.

Please, no, with the booty!

792
00:46:27,084 --> 00:46:29,382
Oh, Mr. Heavy D, I'm so sorry.

793
00:46:29,654 --> 00:46:32,282
I did not mean for this to be heavy.
You know what I mean?

794
00:46:32,490 --> 00:46:33,422
It's OK. It's all right.

795
00:46:33,658 --> 00:46:34,920

It's fine. It's fine.

799
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:42,963
I didn't mean it.

800
00:46:43,267 --> 00:46:43,858
I just wanted to show you.

801
00:46:43,935 --> 00:46:44,560
We'll call the office.

802
00:46:44,802 --> 00:46:45,359
Have a good night.

803
00:46:46,203 --> 00:46:48,398

Oh, good to see you again,
Mr. Blakemore.

00:46:58,683 --> 00:46:59,809
Whoa, no, what a night.

808
00:47:03,621 --> 00:47:05,589
Will there be anything else for you,
Mr. Blakemore?

809
00:47:05,756 --> 00:47:06,780
No, thank you, Albert.

810
00:47:06,991 --> 00:47:08,822
- I'll have the check, though.
- Thank you.

811
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:10,186
You know what, Mr. B?

812
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:11,722
This food ain't all that.

813
00:47:11,896 --> 00:47:13,761
They should've had Mickey up
in the kitchen.

814
00:47:13,998 --> 00:47:14,828
Amen.

815
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:16,460
Nisi, do you cook?

816
00:47:16,634 --> 00:47:18,829
Mm-mmm. I do hair. That's my thing.

817
00:47:19,036 --> 00:47:21,903
- Really? So did Lily. - Who?

818
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:24,997
Oh, grandma. Yeah, Lily.

819
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:26,504
Grandma could grease a scalp,
couldn't she?

820
00:47:26,711 --> 00:47:27,609
Uh-huh.

821
00:47:27,812 --> 00:47:30,406
Tell me more about her. It's been so long.

822
00:47:33,584 --> 00:47:34,642
Let's see.

823
00:47:37,288 --> 00:47:38,220
Grandma.

824
00:47:38,456 --> 00:47:44,395
Oh, Lily, she have a big...

825
00:47:44,629 --> 00:47:45,493
Take care, Mr. Blakemore.

826
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:47,093
I hope everything was
to your satisfaction.

827
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:48,028
Thank you.

828
00:47:56,774 --> 00:47:58,503
Oh, Ali, stop.

829
00:48:01,612 --> 00:48:04,604
Mmm-hmm, I miss you, too.

830
00:48:04,815 --> 00:48:08,717
You know, I'm sorry things got
kind of crazy before I left, you know?

831
00:48:08,919 --> 00:48:10,546
But that's how that go.

832
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:14,752
What?

833
00:48:16,193 --> 00:48:19,458
Oh, so you think I'm going to
come crawling back?

834
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:26,199
I hope them negative words
taste real good rolling off your lips...

835
00:48:26,404 --> 00:48:28,099
because one day
you're going to have to eat them.

836
00:48:31,042 --> 00:48:32,669
Is everything all right, Miss?

837
00:48:35,813 --> 00:48:38,407
Now, then, who could be calling
at this time of night?

838
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,080
It's my boyfriend.

839
00:48:42,353 --> 00:48:43,615
Shall I answer?

840
00:48:48,192 --> 00:48:50,160
This is the Blakemore residence.

841
00:48:50,895 --> 00:48:52,089
One moment, please.

842
00:48:52,596 --> 00:48:53,824
It's for you.

843
00:48:56,033 --> 00:48:58,968
You tell him I'm through with his sorry ass.

844
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:02,199
Go on, tell him.

845
00:49:05,609 --> 00:49:06,701
Hello, sir.

846
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:09,411
She's through with your sorry ass.

847
00:49:12,583 --> 00:49:15,552
I wonder, would you mind
repeating that, sir?

848
00:49:17,088 --> 00:49:17,679
Thank you.

849
00:49:17,888 --> 00:49:20,982
He says you're tripping
because you're in Hollywood...

850
00:49:21,125 --> 00:49:23,958
and he hopes you don't get played.

851
00:49:25,529 --> 00:49:29,863
Oh, I'm tripping, and he hope
I don't get played?

852
00:49:30,134 --> 00:49:31,761
Tell him he better hop his mama
don't get played.

853
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:33,268
Hello, sir.

854
00:49:33,471 --> 00:49:36,099
She hopes your mama don't get played.

855
00:49:37,842 --> 00:49:39,332
Wait a moment, sir.

856
00:49:40,044 --> 00:49:43,775
- Yes, she is, as a matter of fact.
- What?

857
00:49:44,281 --> 00:49:46,408
He asked if you were biting your lip.

858
00:49:47,017 --> 00:49:48,541
Yes, yes.

859
00:49:49,019 --> 00:49:52,113
But that's truly extraordinary, isn't it?

860
00:49:53,290 --> 00:49:54,416
All right, sir, I will.

861
00:49:54,592 --> 00:49:55,559
Good night now.

862
00:49:56,060 --> 00:49:56,856
What he say?

863
00:49:56,994 --> 00:50:00,555
Well, he said he's sorry,
maybe he's tripping...

864
00:50:00,798 --> 00:50:04,859
but he misses you very much on the real.

865
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:08,868
Good night, Miss.

866
00:50:12,376 --> 00:50:13,434
On the real.

867
00:50:23,420 --> 00:50:27,083
This little piggy ate the ravioli.

868
00:50:32,163 --> 00:50:34,290
Why you wearing them gloves
in the house?

869
00:50:36,567 --> 00:50:40,196
Because, my love, your skin is too soft...

870
00:50:40,371 --> 00:50:43,636
to suffer the roughness
of my hard-working hands.

871
00:50:45,409 --> 00:50:47,240
You are so sweet.

872
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:56,717
Wait, wait, wait, whoa. Wait.

873
00:50:56,887 --> 00:50:58,752
I ain't doing that till I get married.

874
00:50:59,056 --> 00:51:00,751
You putting a ring on this finger?

875
00:51:01,792 --> 00:51:02,952
A ring?

876
00:51:04,862 --> 00:51:06,489
I already have a ring.

877
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:08,157
You do?

878
00:51:08,632 --> 00:51:09,621
Come with me.

879
00:51:12,803 --> 00:51:17,467
Mr. Blakemore was kind enough
to let me keep the ring safe in here.

880
00:51:26,550 --> 00:51:27,983
- Ready? - Yes.

881
00:51:43,801 --> 00:51:44,961
I can't open it.

882
00:51:45,135 --> 00:51:46,898
Oh, OK. Well, let me try. Let me try.

883
00:51:47,104 --> 00:51:48,093
What's the combo?

884
00:51:48,706 --> 00:51:51,368
- 5 left. - 5 left.

885
00:51:51,642 --> 00:51:55,373
- Zero right. - Zero right.

886
00:51:55,579 --> 00:51:56,944
And 10 left.

887
00:51:58,449 --> 00:51:59,814
10 left.

888
00:52:03,988 --> 00:52:05,580
It's not opening, is it?

889
00:52:05,789 --> 00:52:07,154
That's not it.

890
00:52:08,392 --> 00:52:10,087
It's all right, bellissima.

891
00:52:10,327 --> 00:52:13,592
I will verify the code
with Mr. Blakemore in the morning.

892
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:15,287
Promise?

893
00:52:17,001 --> 00:52:17,899
Promise.

894
00:52:19,937 --> 00:52:20,995
OK.

895
00:52:30,814 --> 00:52:31,872
Have a good night.

896
00:52:34,418 --> 00:52:35,544
Sleep tight.

897
00:52:46,997 --> 00:52:48,988
Welcome to
the British Overseas Network.

898
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:53,029
The following BBC program
can be heard again on Thursday at...

899
00:53:47,458 --> 00:53:49,983
Oh, so you stealing, huh?

900
00:53:52,963 --> 00:53:55,557
I'm going to have to beat you
like you stole something then.

901
00:54:09,780 --> 00:54:13,113
Oh, I'm going to have to hit you hard,
like Tyson.

902
00:54:17,821 --> 00:54:18,685
Nisi?

903
00:54:19,656 --> 00:54:20,588
Ooh, what?

904
00:54:20,758 --> 00:54:21,486
Nisi?

905
00:54:21,859 --> 00:54:24,054
Ooh! Ha ha ha. What?

906
00:54:24,395 --> 00:54:25,862
Tyson wouldn't hit him like that.

907
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:27,020
He wouldn't?

908
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:30,365
No. He'd hit him like this.

909
00:54:32,536 --> 00:54:33,764
Oh, no, no, no.

910
00:54:33,904 --> 00:54:34,893
You ain't seen his last fight...

911
00:54:35,105 --> 00:54:36,766
'cause you was in the kitchen
getting popcorn.

912
00:54:37,541 --> 00:54:40,135
Tyson... would do it like...

913
00:54:40,310 --> 00:54:41,106
This!

914
00:54:41,245 --> 00:54:43,042
No, Tyson...

915
00:54:43,247 --> 00:54:45,044
Would really hit him like...

916
00:54:45,215 --> 00:54:46,546
- this! - This!

917
00:54:49,720 --> 00:54:51,551
Yeah, come on.

918
00:55:06,303 --> 00:55:07,702
Antonio.

919
00:55:10,941 --> 00:55:12,203
What's going on here?

920
00:55:12,409 --> 00:55:13,535
What is this?

921
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:16,042
Help me out.

922
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:18,913
Help you out?

923
00:55:20,150 --> 00:55:21,674
I'm calling the police.

924
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:23,853
The three of you are stealing
from my uncle.

925
00:55:24,054 --> 00:55:26,045
No, the girls had nothing to do with it.

926
00:55:29,093 --> 00:55:32,187
- It was Antonio. - Antonio?

927
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:35,356
Isaac, our plan can still work.

928
00:55:35,532 --> 00:55:37,864
It will be our words against theirs.

929
00:55:38,135 --> 00:55:41,127
Her fingerprints are still on the safe, man.

930
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:42,370
I beg your pardon?

931
00:55:42,539 --> 00:55:44,803
I don't know what you're talking about.
What plan?

932
00:55:45,442 --> 00:55:46,636
I'm calling the police.

933
00:55:48,779 --> 00:55:50,804
Oh, my dear, I'm so sorry.

934
00:55:58,355 --> 00:56:01,756
Look what you've done,
you little skeezers!

935
00:56:02,693 --> 00:56:03,682
Skeezers?

936
00:56:04,428 --> 00:56:05,554
Uh-huh.

937
00:56:09,700 --> 00:56:12,100
Now, I'm going to have to
spank that ass like Tyson.

938
00:56:17,441 --> 00:56:18,533
I said come on!

939
00:56:19,309 --> 00:56:20,606
And stay on your feet!

940
00:56:29,686 --> 00:56:33,178
And he was there,
and he hit me from behind.

941
00:56:33,390 --> 00:56:34,618
Well, that was that.

942
00:56:34,825 --> 00:56:39,592
I'll report more fully to you in the morning
and, I promise I'll be there as early as I can.

943
00:56:39,897 --> 00:56:41,296
Thank you so much, officer.

944
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,426
Oh, for goodness sake, let's go.

945
00:56:43,734 --> 00:56:44,962
I'll read you your rights.

946
00:56:45,536 --> 00:56:47,163
You have the right to remain silent.

947
00:56:48,105 --> 00:56:49,595
Hello? You there?

948
00:56:49,940 --> 00:56:52,966
Come on, look at me. Look at me!

949
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:56,172
Did you say right or fight?

950
00:56:56,346 --> 00:56:59,338
Right. You have the right to remain slient.

951
00:56:59,550 --> 00:57:02,485
Anything you say can and will be used
against you in a court of law.

952
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:51,427
I don't know how he slept through all that.
You think he's still alive?

953
00:57:52,369 --> 00:57:53,631
I don't know.

954
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:55,937
Maybe we should check his pulse.

955
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:59,203
Wait a minute, you took a CPR class,
didn't you?

956
00:57:59,343 --> 00:58:03,006
Yeah. 'Cause all the cute guys
was in there.

957
00:58:03,213 --> 00:58:05,773
No! Didn't you learn anything?

958
00:58:06,083 --> 00:58:09,109
No. But I did meet James.

959
00:58:10,854 --> 00:58:14,290
We're going to check his heart
to see if it's still beating.

960
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:16,690
Go on, you check it.

961
00:58:16,927 --> 00:58:17,757
You check it.

962
00:58:17,894 --> 00:58:18,792
- You check it. - You check it.

963
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:20,290
You check it.

964
00:58:21,598 --> 00:58:22,826
It's on your side.

965
00:58:35,712 --> 00:58:37,077
He's alive.

966
00:58:37,481 --> 00:58:38,505
I'm going to bed.

967
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:39,881
Nisi?

968
00:58:42,152 --> 00:58:43,380
Nisi?

969
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:17,917
That's OK. We got it.

970
00:59:25,329 --> 00:59:27,388
Hello. Good morning.

971
00:59:28,732 --> 00:59:31,462
I'm Tracy Shaw,
Mr. Blakemore's attorney.

972
00:59:31,635 --> 00:59:33,796
Look, here, we ain't had nothing to do
with what happened last night.

973
00:59:33,970 --> 00:59:34,959
I swear to God.

974
00:59:35,505 --> 00:59:36,597
Oh, I know.

975
00:59:36,840 --> 00:59:38,535
And if anybody says differently...

976
00:59:38,675 --> 00:59:40,506
you make sure you have them call me.

977
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:45,742
Everything is OK now.

978
00:59:45,916 --> 00:59:48,885
Thank God we caught this
before Isaac went too far.

979
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:53,980
I received this package
from his attorney this morning.

980
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:01,860
Mr. Blakemore...

981
01:00:02,032 --> 01:00:05,524
Isaac has filed documents
of incompetency against you.

982
01:00:05,836 --> 01:00:07,497
I guess once he got the photos
he needed...

983
01:00:07,704 --> 01:00:09,865
this girls were no longer of
any value to him.

984
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:15,371
He claims you befriended two girls
from the ghetto...

985
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,445
after you caught them
trying to break into your home.

986
01:00:19,149 --> 01:00:21,310
You then moved the girls into your home...

987
01:00:21,485 --> 01:00:24,477
and, for a lack of a better phrase...

988
01:00:24,788 --> 01:00:27,256
you've been allowing them
to rob you blind.

989
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,952
How dare he!

990
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:34,995
Girl, I can't believe
Isaac would do this to Mr. Blakemore.

991
01:00:35,165 --> 01:00:37,360
Yeah, that is kind of messed up.

992
01:00:39,202 --> 01:00:42,194
Mickey, Nisi, it was a pleasure
meeting the both of you.

993
01:00:42,406 --> 01:00:44,033
How's he doing?
Does he want something to eat?

994
01:00:44,541 --> 01:00:47,237
I think he just needs to rest right now.

995
01:00:49,146 --> 01:00:52,081
- He will be fine. Good-bye. - Bye.

996
01:00:54,351 --> 01:00:56,182
All he needs is energy.

997
01:00:57,687 --> 01:00:58,585
Remember when I told you...

998
01:00:58,789 --> 01:01:01,087
my grandmama used to make
my granddaddy a special drink...

999
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:02,622
that would get him going?

1000
01:01:04,194 --> 01:01:05,252
Yeah?

1001
01:01:06,129 --> 01:01:08,359
But didn't you tell me
that is not only got him up...

1002
01:01:08,598 --> 01:01:10,498
but that it got him... up?

1003
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:11,997
Up is up.

1004
01:01:14,171 --> 01:01:17,629
I don't know how we're going to
get him to drink all them egg yolks.

1005
01:01:18,909 --> 01:01:21,139
The same way my grandmama did.

1006
01:01:28,418 --> 01:01:30,545
Ladies, I didn't hear you come in.

1007
01:01:30,754 --> 01:01:31,618
- Hi. - Hi.

1008
01:01:31,822 --> 01:01:32,811
Hello.

1009
01:01:33,023 --> 01:01:35,184
We decided to make you
a breakfast drink.

1010
01:01:37,661 --> 01:01:38,992
You didn't have to do that.

1011
01:01:39,229 --> 01:01:40,355
But we wanted to.

1012
01:01:40,864 --> 01:01:42,729
We're sorry about what happened
last night.

1013
01:01:42,966 --> 01:01:43,762
Yeah.

1014
01:01:44,334 --> 01:01:45,858
Yeah, so am I.

1015
01:01:46,770 --> 01:01:47,896
Please have a seat.

1016
01:01:55,612 --> 01:01:57,045
Money.

1017
01:02:00,317 --> 01:02:03,445
Money makes people
do the strangest things.

1018
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:07,651
Isaac brought you here
for his own selfish reasons...

1019
01:02:07,924 --> 01:02:11,018
but did he promise you anything?

1020
01:02:14,698 --> 01:02:15,892
Like a fee?

1021
01:02:17,200 --> 01:02:19,600
- Wasn't no fee involved, was there?
- No.

1022
01:02:20,136 --> 01:02:22,161
We here because we want to be.

1023
01:02:24,574 --> 01:02:30,376
Which is all the more reason
why you should have these.

1024
01:02:35,485 --> 01:02:38,283
- $50,000? - Holy shit!

1025
01:02:40,457 --> 01:02:41,446
I mean shoot.

1026
01:02:41,691 --> 01:02:43,591
Uh-uh, Mr. B.

1027
01:02:44,027 --> 01:02:46,495
Ain't no way we could take this.

1028
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:49,892
We're here because we want to be.

1029
01:02:57,107 --> 01:03:00,702
You know, until this very second...

1030
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:05,738
the only person I ever totally trusted
in my entire life was Lily.

1031
01:03:09,185 --> 01:03:12,484
I feel like dancing.

1032
01:03:33,877 --> 01:03:35,936
Go, go! Get it! Get it!

1033
01:03:49,326 --> 01:03:51,487
Let's get this party jumpin'!

1034
01:03:56,800 --> 01:03:59,166
West Side!

1035
01:04:31,568 --> 01:04:33,263
The roof! The roof!

1036
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:36,132
The roof is on fire!

1037
01:04:58,662 --> 01:05:01,028
Mr. B, you OK?

1038
01:05:01,965 --> 01:05:03,125
Let's go sit down.

1039
01:05:03,767 --> 01:05:04,699
You don't look so good.

1040
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,095
You feeling kind of dizzy?

1041
01:05:07,637 --> 01:05:08,934
Let's sit him down right here.

1042
01:05:09,205 --> 01:05:10,172
Right here.

1043
01:05:10,306 --> 01:05:12,501
OK, I'm fine, really.

1044
01:05:12,709 --> 01:05:13,266
You sure?

1045
01:05:13,476 --> 01:05:15,569
I just got a little short of breath
for a second. I'm OK.

1046
01:05:15,745 --> 01:05:17,872
You was getting down out there, Mr. B.

1047
01:05:18,515 --> 01:05:20,073
I think it's time for us to go home.

1048
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:22,218
Yeah, 'cause Manley's embarrassing us.

1049
01:05:22,385 --> 01:05:24,751
So that's why we made you fall out.
Let's go.

1050
01:05:26,623 --> 01:05:27,681
Come on.

1051
01:05:34,264 --> 01:05:36,164
We had no idea
you could dance like that, Mr. B.

1052
01:05:36,332 --> 01:05:38,562
I haven't had this much fun
since I used to dance with Lily.

1053
01:05:38,802 --> 01:05:40,565
You girls are truly amazing.

1054
01:05:41,337 --> 01:05:44,272
Ah, Lily.
Lily, what a lady.

1055
01:05:44,441 --> 01:05:45,601
What a lady.

1056
01:05:46,976 --> 01:05:49,103
Oh, I'm sorry you didn't meet
the man of your dreams tonight...

1057
01:05:49,312 --> 01:05:50,802
but maybe next time.

1058
01:05:52,415 --> 01:05:53,609
That's OK.

1059
01:05:54,617 --> 01:05:56,517
I've known him since high school anyway.

1060
01:05:57,020 --> 01:05:58,009
Oh?

1061
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:00,646
His name is Ali.

1062
01:06:01,624 --> 01:06:03,148
He's back in Georgia.

1063
01:06:04,961 --> 01:06:06,792
I really love him, too.

1064
01:06:08,131 --> 01:06:09,564
What's the problem, then?

1065
01:06:10,734 --> 01:06:12,929
Ali don't have no dreams...

1066
01:06:13,136 --> 01:06:15,468
no drive, no ambition.

1067
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:16,696
Nothing.

1068
01:06:19,943 --> 01:06:21,274
Just like me.

1069
01:06:25,815 --> 01:06:26,873
No, it's true.

1070
01:06:28,418 --> 01:06:32,354
I almost lost all of my dreams
when I was a very young man.

1071
01:06:33,223 --> 01:06:35,191
Fortunately, there was a...

1072
01:06:36,126 --> 01:06:40,290
a skinny, bowlegged girl
who was filled with dreams.

1073
01:06:41,464 --> 01:06:44,262
Everything I have today
is because of her.

1074
01:06:44,501 --> 01:06:46,560
I mean, I had no ambition.

1075
01:06:46,770 --> 01:06:48,601
But she had enough for the both of us.

1076
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:50,738
What do you mean by that?

1077
01:06:52,142 --> 01:06:55,805
Well, she always dreamt about
becoming a clothing designer...

1078
01:06:56,613 --> 01:06:59,207
and I loved her so much that...

1079
01:06:59,415 --> 01:07:04,079
Oh, so that's how you got interested in
the fabric business.

1080
01:07:05,321 --> 01:07:06,219
Yeah.

1081
01:07:10,760 --> 01:07:12,159
Well, who was she?

1082
01:07:14,297 --> 01:07:15,696
Your grandmother.

1083
01:07:26,509 --> 01:07:30,070
See, that's what I'm... talking about.

1084
01:07:30,280 --> 01:07:33,943
- Ali is different. - Nisi...

1085
01:07:36,252 --> 01:07:39,278
This is no fortune worth
the loss of a true love.

1086
01:07:42,125 --> 01:07:44,184
Some things are priceless.

1087
01:08:19,195 --> 01:08:20,526
Where have you been?

1088
01:08:21,998 --> 01:08:24,967
You know, you've been acting strange
ever since we got home.

1089
01:08:25,168 --> 01:08:26,795
What's up with you, Nisi?

1090
01:08:27,237 --> 01:08:28,261
Nisi?!

1091
01:08:28,504 --> 01:08:30,995
What? I've been thinking, OK...

1092
01:08:31,174 --> 01:08:32,801
about how we going to get up out of here.

1093
01:08:33,076 --> 01:08:36,568
- What?
- Don't act like you don't know, Mickey.

1094
01:08:36,746 --> 01:08:40,580
The guilt... the guilt of what we doing.

1095
01:08:40,783 --> 01:08:43,581
Now, that old man down
there is a nice old man.

1096
01:08:43,753 --> 01:08:47,245
And he ain't got nothing around him
but people trying to use him...

1097
01:08:47,457 --> 01:08:48,719
like you and me.

1098
01:08:48,892 --> 01:08:51,417
I know. Why do you think
I got up and left.

1099
01:08:51,628 --> 01:08:53,926
We should've been done got up and left.

1100
01:09:08,611 --> 01:09:13,048
D, don't you think that
we could at least say good-bye?

1101
01:09:15,718 --> 01:09:18,050
- We can't. - Why?

1102
01:09:21,124 --> 01:09:25,925
Cause if I go to him and I say we leaving...

1103
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:28,626
he going to say, '"Why? '"

1104
01:09:30,033 --> 01:09:32,194
And I'm going to have to tell him...

1105
01:09:32,535 --> 01:09:37,472
that you and me been
a part of this whole big lie.

1106
01:09:39,242 --> 01:09:40,573
I can't do it.

1107
01:09:43,146 --> 01:09:44,579
So we're going to write him a letter...

1108
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:47,215
and we're going to
tell him the truth, everything.

1109
01:09:47,417 --> 01:09:50,045
- Everything? - Everything!

1110
01:10:28,157 --> 01:10:29,556
What time is it?

1111
01:10:32,195 --> 01:10:33,526
12:15.

1112
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:37,493
Why are you still up?

1113
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:40,927
I guess I can't sleep.

1114
01:10:44,307 --> 01:10:46,104
You go on, go back to bed.

1115
01:10:46,275 --> 01:10:48,573
Flight don't leave for another 7 hours.

1116
01:10:48,878 --> 01:10:50,277
I'm going to be downstairs.

1117
01:10:53,683 --> 01:10:55,150
Hey, D...

1118
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:58,883
what we going to do
when we get off that plane?

1119
01:10:59,222 --> 01:11:02,680
We ain't got no money,
no apartment, nothin'.

1120
01:11:04,427 --> 01:11:06,520
We worse than when we started out.

1121
01:11:13,069 --> 01:11:16,368
Maybe, but maybe not.

1122
01:11:17,740 --> 01:11:21,198
Some things is priceless,
you know, Mick?

1123
01:12:48,898 --> 01:12:50,126
Excuse me, Miss.

1124
01:12:50,933 --> 01:12:54,801
It was never my intention
to involve myself in your private affairs...

1125
01:12:55,138 --> 01:12:57,663
or to come off like a player-hater...

1126
01:12:58,741 --> 01:13:00,971
but I have become
a kind of a middleman...

1127
01:13:01,777 --> 01:13:03,244
and I think it's high time...

1128
01:13:03,446 --> 01:13:06,938
that you two talked with each other,
face to face.

1129
01:13:24,333 --> 01:13:28,064
I took your advice
and decided to help myself.

1130
01:13:32,742 --> 01:13:34,437
How did you get here, Ali?

1131
01:13:35,044 --> 01:13:36,739
Your boy Alfred hooked me up.

1132
01:13:37,313 --> 01:13:40,043
He called me late last night and
insisted that we come out right away.

1133
01:13:41,150 --> 01:13:44,677
- We? James here, too? - Yeah.

1134
01:13:45,688 --> 01:13:48,316
Nisi, I don't know if you want to stay here...

1135
01:13:48,524 --> 01:13:51,391
if you want to go home,
or what you want to do.

1136
01:13:52,195 --> 01:13:54,254
All I know is I've had one dream...

1137
01:13:54,597 --> 01:13:56,827
and one dream only since high school...

1138
01:13:59,368 --> 01:14:02,565
And that's... and that's to be with you.

1139
01:14:09,779 --> 01:14:11,747
Come on, they're playing our song.

1140
01:14:43,412 --> 01:14:44,401
You know what?

1141
01:14:44,647 --> 01:14:51,951
Everything you said about me was true.
I do need to change.

1142
01:14:54,457 --> 01:14:55,890
So from now on...

1143
01:14:56,092 --> 01:14:57,753
I promise you, I'm going to change.

1144
01:14:58,894 --> 01:15:00,418
For real?

1145
01:15:01,130 --> 01:15:02,392
For real.

1146
01:15:05,368 --> 01:15:09,304
This... this is the kind of stuff
you deserve.

1147
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:19,975
But I just... I just can't give it to you.

1148
01:15:22,518 --> 01:15:25,078
I mean, you... you deserve nice stuff.

1149
01:15:25,755 --> 01:15:27,882
You deserve a big old house...

1150
01:15:28,791 --> 01:15:31,055
and... and... you... you...

1151
01:15:31,294 --> 01:15:34,889
you... you... deserve your...
your own backyard.

1152
01:15:35,931 --> 01:15:39,992
And... every... everybody else
got a little white dog.

1153
01:15:40,202 --> 01:15:42,432
Why... why you can't have one?

1154
01:15:44,573 --> 01:15:45,938
I want to take you out to dinner...

1155
01:15:46,142 --> 01:15:48,736
and... and every time we go out,
we got to watch...

1156
01:15:49,545 --> 01:15:51,103
other people eat.

1157
01:15:51,714 --> 01:15:53,147
Hell, I want to eat, too.

1158
01:15:57,853 --> 01:16:00,253
And you need... you need some clothes.

1159
01:16:00,489 --> 01:16:03,185
Why... why should you have to wear
your Sunday clothes...

1160
01:16:03,359 --> 01:16:04,724
on... on Wednesday?

1161
01:16:07,363 --> 01:16:08,557
Now, look, girl...

1162
01:16:09,298 --> 01:16:11,266
don't think... don't think
the brother a punk...

1163
01:16:11,434 --> 01:16:13,402
because he crying like a little girl, but...

1164
01:16:14,136 --> 01:16:15,467
You're my queen.

1165
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:17,904
And...

1166
01:16:18,140 --> 01:16:21,007
I... love... Love you!

1167
01:16:22,878 --> 01:16:26,211
James, you ain't never said
nothing like this.

1168
01:16:27,183 --> 01:16:31,017
- Don't say it if you don't mean it.
- I mean it!

1169
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:39,322
Girl, what's wrong with you?

1170
01:16:39,462 --> 01:16:40,895
I'm sorry, James!

1171
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:42,222
I said I mean it!

1172
01:16:53,809 --> 01:16:54,741
Come on!

1173
01:16:55,711 --> 01:16:58,703
Oh, dear. Hurry, hurry. Oh, oh!

1174
01:16:59,815 --> 01:17:01,077
Thank you! Thank you!

1175
01:17:02,952 --> 01:17:04,419
Sir, please, can I get in there?

1176
01:17:04,587 --> 01:17:05,747
It's all right. It's all right.

1177
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:07,547
Don't panic. Manley's here.

1178
01:17:08,758 --> 01:17:10,020
Nisi, hurry up.

1179
01:17:10,226 --> 01:17:12,126
They just took Mr. B to the hospital.

1180
01:17:12,361 --> 01:17:13,726
Come on, hurry!

1181
01:17:46,462 --> 01:17:47,429
I'm glad you came.

1182
01:17:49,832 --> 01:17:53,529
I... I want to thank you for everything
that you've done.

1183
01:17:55,938 --> 01:17:56,836
I, uh...

1184
01:18:04,213 --> 01:18:08,149
You was the one
who was about the money, not us.

1185
01:18:08,451 --> 01:18:10,976
I can't believe that Mr. B is related...

1186
01:18:11,187 --> 01:18:13,849
Speaking of relatives, how's Lily?

1187
01:18:36,178 --> 01:18:37,975
Oh, Mickey, Nisi, come, please.

1188
01:19:02,738 --> 01:19:04,763
You're going to be OK.

1189
01:19:10,145 --> 01:19:11,669
Mr. B...

1190
01:19:16,952 --> 01:19:19,079
I, uh, um...

1191
01:19:26,395 --> 01:19:29,523
I ain't Lily's...

1192
01:19:55,791 --> 01:19:57,190
Mr. B?

1193
01:20:04,199 --> 01:20:06,690
We're losing him.
Get Dr. Russell in here now.

1194
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:10,333
Get me Dr. Jennings
down here immediately.

1195
01:20:10,506 --> 01:20:11,905
Give me a hand, will you, doctor?

1196
01:20:12,107 --> 01:20:13,699
Uh, nurse, get a respirator over here.

1197
01:20:14,209 --> 01:20:15,471
Mr. Blakemore, can you hear me?

1198
01:20:15,678 --> 01:20:17,168
- Oxygen, oxygen. - Mr. Blakemore?

1199
01:20:17,680 --> 01:20:19,409
I didn't get a chance to tell him.

1200
01:20:19,682 --> 01:20:20,808
About Lily?

1201
01:20:26,355 --> 01:20:27,879
You didn't have to.

1202
01:20:30,726 --> 01:20:32,091
He already knew.

1203
01:20:36,065 --> 01:20:39,159
You see, Lily never had any children.

1204
01:20:57,987 --> 01:20:59,045
Go up there and look at the picture.

1205
01:20:59,221 --> 01:21:01,121
Look at the picture.
Now, who the picture remind you of?

1206
01:21:04,159 --> 01:21:05,820
Loquisha Jenkins!

1207
01:21:06,028 --> 01:21:07,518
Yecch, that's so ugly.

1208
01:21:09,365 --> 01:21:10,923
There she go, right there.

1209
01:21:12,001 --> 01:21:13,525
This all your stuff here?

1210
01:21:13,936 --> 01:21:14,925
Don't drag it.

1211
01:21:15,137 --> 01:21:17,002
I'm not gonna drag it.

1212
01:21:17,640 --> 01:21:18,664
You ready to go?

1213
01:21:19,975 --> 01:21:20,999
Wait a minute.

1214
01:21:33,689 --> 01:21:35,122
I...

1215
01:21:37,059 --> 01:21:39,220
I wish you a very pleasant journey.

1216
01:21:44,767 --> 01:21:48,430
Flying first class
is extremely comfortable.

1217
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:52,072
So I've been told.

1218
01:21:59,214 --> 01:22:00,442
We shall miss you.

1219
01:22:05,354 --> 01:22:06,844
We're gonna miss you, too.

1220
01:22:12,728 --> 01:22:14,696
Thank you for everything.

1221
01:22:18,734 --> 01:22:19,996
Manley.

1222
01:22:26,642 --> 01:22:29,907
Alfred will do very nicely, thank you.

1223
01:22:38,887 --> 01:22:40,184
We should get going.

1224
01:22:40,522 --> 01:22:41,454
Not yet.

1225
01:22:42,458 --> 01:22:43,891
I'm glad I caught you.

1226
01:22:44,359 --> 01:22:46,020
This will only take a second.

1227
01:22:46,195 --> 01:22:47,856
Please, follow me.

1228
01:22:49,765 --> 01:22:52,598
I just have a document.
I'd like to review with you all.

1229
01:22:54,903 --> 01:22:57,337
Good morning to you.
Oh, you're still here?

1230
01:22:57,940 --> 01:22:59,202
Good morning, Isaac.

1231
01:23:02,010 --> 01:23:05,946
This is Mr. Blakemore's last will
and testament.

1232
01:23:07,449 --> 01:23:08,677
'"First... '"

1233
01:23:09,618 --> 01:23:11,711
Mr. Blakemore states...

1234
01:23:12,054 --> 01:23:15,512
'"I'd like to thank my B.A.P. S
Nisi and Mickey...

1235
01:23:16,325 --> 01:23:20,386
'"for making the last days of my life
as pleasant as my first year.'"

1236
01:23:20,596 --> 01:23:22,120
Oh, that's sweet.

1237
01:23:24,032 --> 01:23:25,226
B.A.P. S?

1238
01:23:26,802 --> 01:23:29,327
Black American Princesses.

1239
01:23:33,709 --> 01:23:36,109
Uh, yeah. Please continue.
They have a plane to catch.

1240
01:23:36,779 --> 01:23:37,541
Of course.

1241
01:23:38,914 --> 01:23:43,010
'"Second, I, Donald William Blakemore...

1242
01:23:43,185 --> 01:23:45,346
Being of sound heart and mind...

1243
01:23:45,687 --> 01:23:48,155
Hereby request the affairs
of my estate...

1244
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:51,383
To be incontestably implemented
as follows:

1245
01:23:52,461 --> 01:23:54,952
To my B.A.P. S I leave... '"

1246
01:25:18,647 --> 01:25:20,239
Ladies and gentlemen,
I'm Jesse Collins...

1247
01:25:20,515 --> 01:25:22,244
and we are broadcasting live...

1248
01:25:22,451 --> 01:25:26,182
at the only salon-restaurant
in Beverly Hills.

1249
01:25:26,355 --> 01:25:27,151
There are the owners.

1250
01:25:27,389 --> 01:25:29,152
Let's give 'em a big round of applause.

1251
01:25:37,065 --> 01:25:38,794
- I am this impressed! - Roger that.

1252
01:25:38,967 --> 01:25:40,867
Brother, check out the name.
What the name say, huh?

1253
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:45,166
And we got numerous slogans like...

1254
01:25:45,374 --> 01:25:46,306
Now, if you really must be there...

1255
01:25:46,508 --> 01:25:47,566
but you feel you're underage...

1256
01:25:47,743 --> 01:25:49,335
Don't hesitate to give one of us a page.

1257
01:25:49,511 --> 01:25:51,979
And if you're tired of riding
that raggedy-ass bus...

1258
01:25:52,247 --> 01:25:53,874
I ain't got a problem with you pagin' us.

1259
01:25:54,082 --> 01:25:55,481
Now step to the side
while we hit the street...

1260
01:25:55,617 --> 01:25:57,710
then turn to your left and check the fleet.

1261
01:26:09,731 --> 01:26:11,892
This is the grand opening of Lily'Z...

1262
01:26:12,134 --> 01:26:13,965
the only spot in Beverly Hills
where you can get...

1263
01:26:14,136 --> 01:26:17,833
bangs 'n' bacon, weaves 'n' waffles
and eggs and extensions.

1264
01:26:20,842 --> 01:26:21,831
Look.

1265
01:26:24,146 --> 01:26:26,671
Whoa! Rod-man!

1266
01:26:27,215 --> 01:26:29,649
You know, I'm gonna have to
take you blue.

1267
01:26:29,818 --> 01:26:31,979
You ever get tired of that guy
who has the beeper company...

1268
01:26:32,321 --> 01:26:33,879
beep me. I'll take care of you.

1269
01:26:34,089 --> 01:26:35,784
I'm tired. Already.

1270
01:26:39,428 --> 01:26:40,395
Can we talk about the girls?

1271
01:26:40,495 --> 01:26:42,190
Oh, the girls are enchanting!

1272
01:26:42,397 --> 01:26:43,591
Yes, they are.

1273
01:26:43,899 --> 01:26:46,629
Ahh! There you are!

1274
01:26:46,835 --> 01:26:48,427
The telephones haven't stopped ringing.

1275
01:26:48,670 --> 01:26:49,659
They want an exclusive...

1276
01:26:49,838 --> 01:26:52,102
on the grand opening
in New York next month.

1277
01:26:52,607 --> 01:26:55,576
Well, tell E. T,
they can have the Paris opening.

1278
01:26:55,744 --> 01:26:57,974
Absolutely. And give MTV New York.

1279
01:26:58,347 --> 01:26:59,041
Yes.

1280
01:26:59,715 --> 01:27:01,444
And please make sure that
everybody comes...

1281
01:27:01,683 --> 01:27:03,378
to the grand opening
in Decatur, Georgia.

1282
01:27:03,618 --> 01:27:05,552
Ahh, of course.

1283
01:27:06,555 --> 01:27:08,079
Welcome again, ladies and gentlemen...

1284
01:27:08,290 --> 01:27:11,623
the owners of the place to be
in Beverly Hills... Lily'Z!

1285
01:27:11,994 --> 01:27:14,121
Now that the owners are here,
Nisi and Mickey...

1286
01:27:14,296 --> 01:27:16,491
it's time to kick off the grand opening!

1287
01:27:16,665 --> 01:27:17,432
Ladies, come on up here.

1288
01:27:17,432 --> 01:27:19,127
Come and get in your party!
