1
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,040
Kushimori!

2
00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:20,996
- You'll be late.
- Hurry!

3
00:03:53,508 --> 00:03:55,833
I made it.

4
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,295
Move!

5
00:03:58,389 --> 00:04:00,762
Good morning.

6
00:04:01,977 --> 00:04:04,053
- That bike again...
- Road racer.

7
00:04:04,146 --> 00:04:06,186
Why don’t you take the train?

8
00:04:06,274 --> 00:04:08,481
I brought the bourbon. 4,500 yen.

9
00:04:08,568 --> 00:04:10,858
- 4,000.
- 4,500, I said!

10
00:04:10,946 --> 00:04:14,613
- Come on.
- You don’t have to buy it.

11
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:16,741
Okay.

12
00:04:18,915 --> 00:04:23,128
You drink too much.
Is Harper any good?

13
00:04:23,212 --> 00:04:25,751
Sit down.

14
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:35,926
Good morning.

15
00:04:38,315 --> 00:04:40,604
- Aoki?
- Here.

16
00:04:41,152 --> 00:04:43,478
- Iida?
- Here.

17
00:04:43,989 --> 00:04:46,278
Ishioka?

18
00:04:49,371 --> 00:04:51,779
Ishioka?

19
00:04:52,708 --> 00:04:53,954
- Ueno?
- Here.

20
00:04:54,043 --> 00:04:56,036
- Oikawa?
- Here.

21
00:04:56,797 --> 00:04:59,123
- Kushimori?
- Here.

22
00:05:00,426 --> 00:05:02,752
- Sato?
- Here.

23
00:05:03,388 --> 00:05:05,595
- Shinozaki?
- Here.

24
00:05:06,559 --> 00:05:07,674
- Shimizu?
- Here.

25
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,116
Kushimori, what were you
day-dreaming about in class?

26
00:05:19,200 --> 00:05:22,238
- Nothing.
- You just sat there and stared.

27
00:05:24,874 --> 00:05:27,033
I just have a headache.

28
00:05:27,127 --> 00:05:30,129
You've been drinking too much.

29
00:05:30,214 --> 00:05:33,834
Look at the board, not at me.

30
00:05:33,927 --> 00:05:38,057
Do you know why Ishioka
has stopped coming to school?

31
00:05:38,141 --> 00:05:39,933
- No.
- You don't?

32
00:05:40,019 --> 00:05:42,095
No. Why?

33
00:05:42,188 --> 00:05:44,015
I heard...

34
00:05:44,107 --> 00:05:48,735
...you got him so upset
that he hit his parents and his brother.

35
00:05:48,822 --> 00:05:53,699
- That's not true.
- But he did hit them.

36
00:05:54,954 --> 00:05:57,909
What's wrong with that?

37
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,370
If people won't listen,
you have to use force.

38
00:06:01,463 --> 00:06:04,583
You have to draw the line somewhere.

39
00:06:04,675 --> 00:06:08,721
Take it easy. I just want to know
what happened to Ishioka.

40
00:06:08,805 --> 00:06:12,555
- Don't get so upset.
- Fuck off!

41
00:06:12,644 --> 00:06:14,886
You probably don't even realize it...

42
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,765
Sometimes he just gets this smile
on his face.

43
00:06:18,860 --> 00:06:22,859
There! If you keep smiling like that,
people will think you're a psychopath.

44
00:06:22,948 --> 00:06:28,656
People get suspicious
if you’re 17 and smile funny.

45
00:06:28,748 --> 00:06:33,411
I don't stab people
just because I feel like it.

46
00:06:33,504 --> 00:06:37,372
That's not thinking about the future.
It's like dogs fucking on the road.

47
00:06:37,467 --> 00:06:40,385
It's a lack of imagination.

48
00:06:40,471 --> 00:06:43,722
Dogs lack imagination?

49
00:06:43,808 --> 00:06:48,436
Would you want to be a dog?

50
00:06:50,025 --> 00:06:53,976
Anyway, murder requires imagination.

51
00:06:54,072 --> 00:06:56,610
Imagination?

52
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,942
Yeah, imagination.

53
00:06:59,036 --> 00:07:01,326
Look.

54
00:07:58,612 --> 00:08:04,984
I screwed up.
Daimon's been watching me in class.

55
00:08:05,079 --> 00:08:08,864
I have to be more careful.

56
00:08:13,924 --> 00:08:16,795
Dogs don’t have imagination.

57
00:08:17,303 --> 00:08:21,171
It's the same thing
with cats and sheep.

58
00:08:21,266 --> 00:08:26,013
That's why they don’t brood,
get depressed, and hang themselves.

59
00:08:26,898 --> 00:08:29,984
I'm not losing my imagination.

60
00:08:30,737 --> 00:08:34,522
I have a lot of things to do
before I hang myself.

61
00:08:36,870 --> 00:08:42,114
How do I get rid of that asshole?
Do I burn the house down?

62
00:08:43,545 --> 00:08:47,959
Maybe I can make it look like
he got run over in an accident.

63
00:08:49,803 --> 00:08:52,923
I have to think of something.

64
00:08:53,015 --> 00:08:55,887
How do I save my family?

65
00:08:59,816 --> 00:09:02,687
Think, think, think!

66
00:09:08,118 --> 00:09:10,360
- Dressing?
- Thanks.

67
00:09:10,454 --> 00:09:13,456
Shuichi, have some vegetables.

68
00:09:16,128 --> 00:09:20,341
- I'll have some more.
- It'll just make you fatter.

69
00:09:20,425 --> 00:09:23,178
Shut up.

70
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:26,430
- I'll help you eat.
- Stop it!

71
00:09:26,892 --> 00:09:29,562
Listen to him!

72
00:09:29,645 --> 00:09:32,315
- Stop it.
- I'll eat some...

73
00:09:43,288 --> 00:09:46,159
Do you want dinner?

74
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:49,002
Sake.

75
00:09:49,796 --> 00:09:52,584
Okay... Sure.

76
00:10:08,862 --> 00:10:13,656
Where did that come from?
Did you buy it for him?

77
00:10:18,833 --> 00:10:23,413
You must have.
Nobody else here drinks shochu.

78
00:10:25,341 --> 00:10:28,343
Is he paying you for it?

79
00:10:28,429 --> 00:10:32,262
- Why do you do that?
- Why not?

80
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:37,097
What's he doing here?
He's not our concern anymore!

81
00:10:37,190 --> 00:10:39,598
Where else would he go?

82
00:10:39,693 --> 00:10:41,686
Don’t tell me he's moving back in.

83
00:10:41,779 --> 00:10:45,825
- No, he's not.
- Then get rid of him!

84
00:10:45,909 --> 00:10:50,869
- He’ll find a place soon.
- Do you really believe that?

85
00:10:51,750 --> 00:10:55,120
- Do something.
- Stop it!

86
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:52,656
Can you hear that sound?

87
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:57,408
Mom and Haruka are probably in bed
with their hands over their ears.

88
00:11:57,668 --> 00:12:01,287
I'm the only one
who can get rid of him.

89
00:12:16,066 --> 00:12:19,021
I'm sorry you had to wait.

90
00:12:24,702 --> 00:12:27,953
Kushimori Shuichi. Nice to meet you.

91
00:12:30,793 --> 00:12:34,460
Try to relax. Have a seat.

92
00:12:34,548 --> 00:12:37,218
Pull up a chair.

93
00:12:38,261 --> 00:12:41,133
Sit down.

94
00:12:42,100 --> 00:12:45,434
You told me you had a legal problem.

95
00:12:45,562 --> 00:12:50,142
How do you get rid of someone-

96
00:12:50,235 --> 00:12:53,153
- who's moved into your house?

97
00:12:53,656 --> 00:12:56,693
Are you talking about Sone Takashi?

98
00:12:56,868 --> 00:12:59,158
How did you know?

99
00:12:59,246 --> 00:13:02,533
I thought of him when you called.

100
00:13:02,626 --> 00:13:05,331
We don't need tea right now.

101
00:13:08,842 --> 00:13:11,512
He put up such a fight
over the divorce.

102
00:13:11,596 --> 00:13:14,681
He just turned up and moved back in.

103
00:13:14,766 --> 00:13:18,267
Isn’t there a legal way
of getting rid of him?

104
00:13:21,108 --> 00:13:26,696
The court could act
if your mother filed a complaint.

105
00:13:26,782 --> 00:13:29,700
But why did she let him back in?

106
00:13:29,785 --> 00:13:33,072
She wouldn’t have,
not if I had been there.

107
00:13:33,540 --> 00:13:36,744
He just turned up one day
when Haruka...

108
00:13:36,836 --> 00:13:42,294
...my kid sister,
happened to be home by herself.

109
00:13:43,470 --> 00:13:46,922
Are you sure that's just a coincidence?

110
00:13:55,443 --> 00:13:58,065
When did Sone turn up?

111
00:13:58,197 --> 00:14:00,439
Ten days ago.

112
00:14:00,533 --> 00:14:04,033
- Has he been there since?
- Yes.

113
00:14:05,581 --> 00:14:10,708
I wonder why your mom
hasn’t told him to leave.

114
00:14:11,380 --> 00:14:13,919
I don’t know.

115
00:14:14,009 --> 00:14:17,675
She must be worried about something.

116
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:25,808
Can you tell me anything
about their divorce?

117
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:30,104
Anything might be useful.

118
00:14:31,030 --> 00:14:35,243
Your father died in a car accident,
if my memory serves me.

119
00:14:35,328 --> 00:14:38,163
That's right.

120
00:14:38,248 --> 00:14:44,086
Then your mom met Sone.
He seemed nice at first-

121
00:14:44,172 --> 00:14:48,716
- but the longer he stayed with you,
the worse he got.

122
00:14:49,888 --> 00:14:55,132
I don't know what his problem is...

123
00:14:55,228 --> 00:15:00,472
...but he drank all the time,
and he hit your mother.

124
00:15:01,736 --> 00:15:06,483
She divorced him
because she was concerned for you.

125
00:15:06,576 --> 00:15:11,286
She told me she was afraid
that he would kill you.

126
00:15:11,916 --> 00:15:15,749
Didn’t he use to beat you up?

127
00:15:18,675 --> 00:15:22,044
I can’t remember.

128
00:15:22,388 --> 00:15:26,386
I just have some vague memories.

129
00:15:28,020 --> 00:15:31,639
Mom talking quietly...

130
00:15:32,901 --> 00:15:36,105
Haruka was still a baby...

131
00:15:36,197 --> 00:15:39,531
Something smelled nice...

132
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:50,288
But I can’t remember
anything about myself.

133
00:15:52,718 --> 00:15:55,589
I don't know why.

134
00:16:13,369 --> 00:16:15,612
Hi.

135
00:16:15,706 --> 00:16:20,120
- Where's Haruka?
- She's at a friend's place.

136
00:16:23,132 --> 00:16:26,668
No. He's not back yet.

137
00:16:30,934 --> 00:16:34,469
You're home late.
Where have you been?

138
00:16:35,189 --> 00:16:37,597
Around.

139
00:16:37,692 --> 00:16:40,564
Shopping?

140
00:16:41,447 --> 00:16:45,398
- I saw a lawyer.
- A lawyer?

141
00:16:45,494 --> 00:16:48,698
Mr. Kano. You know him.

142
00:16:48,790 --> 00:16:52,623
He handled your divorce ten years ago.

143
00:16:57,926 --> 00:17:01,877
I asked him
what we should do about "him".

144
00:17:06,229 --> 00:17:10,274
Mr. Kano told me
he wants to meet you.

145
00:17:10,359 --> 00:17:13,111
- Why?
- What do you mean?

146
00:17:13,196 --> 00:17:16,945
You have to file a complaint
to get rid of him.

147
00:17:17,118 --> 00:17:20,238
- I’ll think about it.
- For how long?

148
00:17:20,330 --> 00:17:22,869
Just a little while. Okay?

149
00:17:22,958 --> 00:17:25,664
- Not yet.
- Why not?

150
00:17:25,754 --> 00:17:28,755
The longer he stays,
the worse off we’ll be.

151
00:17:28,841 --> 00:17:30,917
He might do something to Haruka!

152
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,716
I haven’t forgotten Haruka, or you.

153
00:17:33,806 --> 00:17:38,516
Then why would you let him stay?
I don't get it!

154
00:17:40,314 --> 00:17:44,894
I hope you're not planning
to get back together again.

155
00:18:08,433 --> 00:18:11,435
Quiet, everybody!

156
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,270
Roll call.

157
00:18:16,318 --> 00:18:21,907
Aoki? Lida? Ishioka?
Ishioka's not here.

158
00:18:21,992 --> 00:18:26,121
Ueno? Emoto? And so on...

159
00:18:28,751 --> 00:18:32,584
Okay, work on your paintings.

160
00:18:48,526 --> 00:18:52,228
- What's that?
- It's a seascape.

161
00:18:52,323 --> 00:18:55,408
What's Doraemon doing in a seascape?

162
00:18:55,493 --> 00:18:59,955
That's not a cat.
It's a cloud, damn it!

163
00:19:00,666 --> 00:19:03,289
What the hell are you doing?

164
00:19:03,378 --> 00:19:05,917
I'm sorry... sucker.

165
00:19:06,007 --> 00:19:08,083
Bastard!

166
00:19:14,100 --> 00:19:18,051
Look what you did! Stupid!

167
00:19:29,829 --> 00:19:32,367
- I'm sorry.
- Really?

168
00:19:32,457 --> 00:19:35,375
Yes.

169
00:19:35,461 --> 00:19:39,674
Then come with me
to the art-supply store tomorrow.

170
00:20:11,424 --> 00:20:13,215
I don't get it.

171
00:20:13,301 --> 00:20:16,885
Superpowers... on!

172
00:20:18,474 --> 00:20:21,559
- No customers.
- I've noticed that.

173
00:20:21,645 --> 00:20:25,596
"I wanna go home... "

174
00:20:25,692 --> 00:20:29,228
- Then go.
- I was just singing.

175
00:20:29,321 --> 00:20:32,988
It's fine. I’ll finish up here.

176
00:20:33,076 --> 00:20:36,280
If you're sure it's okay...

177
00:20:36,414 --> 00:20:38,573
Thanks. Good night.

178
00:20:50,807 --> 00:20:54,509
You can’t wear a face guard
inside the store.

179
00:20:58,776 --> 00:21:02,477
Take the helmet off, Ishioka Takuya.

180
00:21:03,824 --> 00:21:07,953
- How did you know it was me?
- It wasn’t difficult to figure out.

181
00:21:08,288 --> 00:21:11,243
- How are you?
- I'm okay. How about you?

182
00:21:11,333 --> 00:21:14,419
My family keeps avoiding me.

183
00:21:14,504 --> 00:21:17,839
I don't really mind-

184
00:21:17,925 --> 00:21:22,838
- but they look the other way when
I bump into them in the bathroom.

185
00:21:23,349 --> 00:21:26,019
It's tough in the long run.

186
00:21:26,102 --> 00:21:29,187
I want to get out of there.

187
00:21:29,648 --> 00:21:35,735
I feel like there's no air there.
I can’t breathe.

188
00:21:35,823 --> 00:21:39,608
- I want my knife back.
- No. Not yet.

189
00:21:39,703 --> 00:21:42,325
Why not? It's expensive.

190
00:21:42,415 --> 00:21:45,619
You’ll just do something foolish again.

191
00:21:47,672 --> 00:21:51,753
I wish something good would happen.

192
00:21:52,761 --> 00:21:55,087
Get yourself something to drink.

193
00:21:55,181 --> 00:21:59,346
- Is it okay?
- Just one.

194
00:22:00,605 --> 00:22:05,102
Maybe I should start working
in a convenience store, too.

195
00:22:05,194 --> 00:22:09,656
They check, stupid. My treat.

196
00:22:10,701 --> 00:22:12,860
Really?

197
00:22:17,126 --> 00:22:19,452
Thank you.

198
00:22:21,381 --> 00:22:24,300
I'll drop by again.

199
00:22:42,200 --> 00:22:44,905
Didn’t you want art supplies?

200
00:22:44,995 --> 00:22:46,952
What?

201
00:22:47,039 --> 00:22:49,875
Nothing.

202
00:22:51,712 --> 00:22:54,797
Why won’t Ishioka come to school?

203
00:22:55,592 --> 00:22:59,460
- I don’t know.
- I heard...

204
00:22:59,597 --> 00:23:03,927
...that you told him to hit his family.

205
00:23:06,105 --> 00:23:08,858
Why did you do that?

206
00:23:08,942 --> 00:23:12,608
He had a knife.
He was going to kill them.

207
00:23:12,697 --> 00:23:15,449
What?!

208
00:23:15,534 --> 00:23:19,283
His family never has anytime for him.

209
00:23:19,372 --> 00:23:22,623
His wonderful brother
gets all their attention.

210
00:23:22,710 --> 00:23:24,335
But killing them...?

211
00:23:24,420 --> 00:23:26,793
That's why I took his knife away-

212
00:23:26,882 --> 00:23:29,967
- and talked him into just hitting them.

213
00:23:30,094 --> 00:23:35,719
- To turn the heat down a bit?
- Yeah. Let's change the subject.

214
00:23:41,150 --> 00:23:45,694
There's something
I've been meaning to tell you.

215
00:23:47,491 --> 00:23:50,861
- Dogs have imagination.
- What?

216
00:23:51,663 --> 00:23:56,576
The other day
you told Daimon and Oikawa...

217
00:23:56,670 --> 00:23:58,710
...that they don't.

218
00:23:58,797 --> 00:24:01,289
Stop eavesdropping.

219
00:24:02,218 --> 00:24:06,264
Our dog has nightmares.

220
00:24:07,141 --> 00:24:12,386
They're pretty bad, I think.
He talks in his sleep.

221
00:24:12,482 --> 00:24:15,602
He talks?

222
00:24:15,777 --> 00:24:20,654
- "I'm not a dog," he says.
- "I'm not a dog?"

223
00:24:20,742 --> 00:24:23,993
"I'm not a dog!"

224
00:24:25,123 --> 00:24:29,418
You looked in your notebook
and stared at me.

225
00:24:29,920 --> 00:24:32,329
Why?

226
00:24:32,424 --> 00:24:34,583
No reason.

227
00:24:34,718 --> 00:24:39,013
I'd drawn a picture of a yawning lion
with long eyelashes.

228
00:24:39,099 --> 00:24:41,769
What?

229
00:24:42,270 --> 00:24:46,648
<i>Report and revision.
First, the report.</i>

230
00:24:47,318 --> 00:24:52,740
<i>I had a date with Noriko today.
I think you could call it a date.</i>

231
00:24:53,159 --> 00:24:56,992
<i>She's not as stuck-up
as everyone says.</i>

232
00:24:57,497 --> 00:24:59,574
<i>Revision...</i>

233
00:24:59,667 --> 00:25:02,918
Dogs may have imagination.

234
00:25:03,422 --> 00:25:05,913
"I'm not a dog... "

235
00:25:06,634 --> 00:25:09,802
Can’t you say hi to your own dad?

236
00:25:10,472 --> 00:25:12,715
No. Stop it!

237
00:25:13,518 --> 00:25:16,389
Shuichi!

238
00:25:17,064 --> 00:25:21,526
Let go! What are you doing?

239
00:25:23,072 --> 00:25:27,486
- What's all this shouting?
- Keep your hands off Haruka!

240
00:25:27,577 --> 00:25:30,782
Keep your hands off her!

241
00:25:30,873 --> 00:25:33,579
Shut up, you brat!

242
00:25:33,669 --> 00:25:38,083
You're the one
who's all over her all the time.

243
00:25:39,343 --> 00:25:44,302
You've got your eye
on her yourself, right? Don’t you?

244
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:47,058
Son of a bitch!

245
00:25:47,144 --> 00:25:50,846
Why are you waving
that thing around?

246
00:25:53,027 --> 00:25:56,728
Shuichi, don't!

247
00:25:56,823 --> 00:26:01,617
You're all talk.
What are you going to do?

248
00:26:01,704 --> 00:26:04,279
- Come on, you bastard!
- Shut up!

249
00:26:04,374 --> 00:26:06,997
I mean it.

250
00:26:07,086 --> 00:26:11,251
Stop it! What are you doing?

251
00:26:12,385 --> 00:26:14,923
What's wrong with you?

252
00:26:15,931 --> 00:26:20,224
Stop it!

253
00:26:20,979 --> 00:26:22,853
You promised!

254
00:26:22,940 --> 00:26:29,276
I'm not the one who started this.
He came running and screamed at me.

255
00:26:31,326 --> 00:26:34,280
Take this.

256
00:26:34,371 --> 00:26:36,910
Cut it out now.

257
00:26:57,567 --> 00:26:59,608
Shuichi?

258
00:27:00,947 --> 00:27:03,735
Can I come in?

259
00:27:45,921 --> 00:27:52,127
There's something
I really have to tell you.

260
00:27:55,934 --> 00:27:58,639
Are you listening?

261
00:28:03,235 --> 00:28:07,530
I know it’s not good for us
to have Sone staying here.

262
00:28:07,615 --> 00:28:11,614
But there’s a problem.

263
00:28:13,081 --> 00:28:19,915
Haruka came here with Sone.
She's not really your sister.

264
00:28:22,468 --> 00:28:28,424
When we got divorced, I took you
and me off Sone's family register.

265
00:28:29,018 --> 00:28:33,480
But Haruka's still on it,
as his daughter.

266
00:28:35,276 --> 00:28:40,520
I thought about adopting her...

267
00:28:42,869 --> 00:28:49,074
...but they told me I would
have to get permission from Sone.

268
00:28:50,420 --> 00:28:53,541
He refused.

269
00:29:01,267 --> 00:29:06,690
If I make him leave,
he's sure to bring it up.

270
00:29:07,066 --> 00:29:09,736
I don’t want...

271
00:29:10,112 --> 00:29:14,989
...you or Haruka
to get dragged into this.

272
00:29:27,884 --> 00:29:31,420
Haruka will be 15 this spring.

273
00:29:32,349 --> 00:29:36,264
Then she can decide for herself
if she wants me to adopt her-

274
00:29:36,354 --> 00:29:39,024
- and become your sister for real.

275
00:29:39,107 --> 00:29:42,442
I'm begging you...

276
00:29:44,406 --> 00:29:47,740
Just hang in there a little longer.

277
00:29:49,495 --> 00:29:52,581
Haruka doesn’t know.

278
00:29:53,959 --> 00:29:57,626
I should have told you.

279
00:29:58,966 --> 00:30:01,255
I'm sorry.

280
00:30:33,510 --> 00:30:36,512
Leave this house.

281
00:30:40,436 --> 00:30:43,437
Do you need money?

282
00:32:56,985 --> 00:33:00,569
<i>...and this produces
vast amounts of energy.</i>

283
00:33:00,781 --> 00:33:06,239
<i>A high-energy particle
transmitted through water-</i>

284
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:10,578
<i>- produces a blue glow-</i>

285
00:33:10,669 --> 00:33:14,798
<i>- called "Cherenkov light".</i>

286
00:33:14,883 --> 00:33:20,341
<i>This can be seen
with highly radioactive substances-</i>

287
00:33:20,432 --> 00:33:24,300
<i>- like spent nuclear fuel.</i>

288
00:33:25,313 --> 00:33:30,771
<i>Radioactive phenomena
are considered very dangerous-</i>

289
00:33:30,862 --> 00:33:35,691
<i>- but they occur in nature
and even within the human body.</i>

290
00:33:39,790 --> 00:33:45,627
<i>I'll get rid of this intruder
who's threatening my family.</i>

291
00:33:47,758 --> 00:33:53,929
<i>Matsuoka Shiro... will be my name.
A new me.</i>

292
00:33:56,227 --> 00:33:58,517
Mr. Matsuoka Shiro...

293
00:33:58,605 --> 00:34:02,687
<i>You can be anonymous
on the Internet.</i>

294
00:34:03,236 --> 00:34:09,822
<i>I'll do a search on things
like medicine and juvenile crime-</i>

295
00:34:09,911 --> 00:34:12,450
<i>- and look at underground sites.</i>

296
00:34:12,540 --> 00:34:17,962
<i>"Aqueous cyanide... "
This looks interesting.</i>

297
00:34:18,047 --> 00:34:20,883
<i>"Feels like a bad hangover. "</i>

298
00:34:22,177 --> 00:34:26,757
<i>I can use this to knock him out...</i>

299
00:34:28,352 --> 00:34:31,603
<i>...and he won't have his way anymore.</i>

300
00:34:32,106 --> 00:34:35,642
<i>Matsuoka Shiro, at a PO box address.</i>

301
00:34:37,071 --> 00:34:41,616
<i>This way I won't leave a trace.</i>

302
00:34:45,916 --> 00:34:49,416
<i>I'm Matsuoka Shiro.</i>

303
00:34:50,046 --> 00:34:54,756
<i>The drug comes to his PO box.</i>

304
00:34:54,844 --> 00:34:58,428
<i>But Matsuoka Shiro doesn't exist.</i>

305
00:34:58,515 --> 00:35:02,217
<i>You can't see him, you can't hear him.</i>

306
00:35:02,854 --> 00:35:06,306
<i>My tape recorder,
the thing that records me-</i>

307
00:35:06,400 --> 00:35:11,277
<i>- turns my pain into words.</i>

308
00:35:11,365 --> 00:35:17,037
<i>My words... The secret story
about everything that troubles me.</i>

309
00:35:17,122 --> 00:35:21,786
<i>Proof... "The perfect crime. "
What is that?</i>

310
00:35:22,588 --> 00:35:27,417
<i>I have the poison.
Let the experiment begin.</i>

311
00:35:28,178 --> 00:35:31,513
<i>I'll put some in his shochu.</i>

312
00:35:33,518 --> 00:35:38,894
<i>I'll use a title at first, and then
I'll gradually increase the dose.</i>

313
00:35:40,736 --> 00:35:46,657
<i>I can weaken his body that way.</i>

314
00:35:49,539 --> 00:35:52,540
<i>The decision has been made.</i>

315
00:35:53,252 --> 00:35:56,207
<i>It's easy.</i>

316
00:35:56,297 --> 00:35:59,714
<i>I just have to close my eyes-</i>

317
00:35:59,802 --> 00:36:04,382
<i>- and wait
for the inevitable to happen.</i>

318
00:36:06,394 --> 00:36:11,271
<i>Now there’s just the question
of what I'll actually kill him with.</i>

319
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:19,196
Shuichi...

320
00:36:19,285 --> 00:36:21,741
You hid something.
It's a dirty book!

321
00:36:21,830 --> 00:36:23,954
Don't come in here.

322
00:36:24,041 --> 00:36:26,794
Put a shirt on.

323
00:36:26,878 --> 00:36:29,915
There's a lady present.

324
00:36:33,053 --> 00:36:35,924
What do you want?

325
00:36:36,015 --> 00:36:41,473
I just wondered what you were doing
cooped up in here all the time.

326
00:36:42,857 --> 00:36:44,233
Mom's worried.

327
00:36:44,317 --> 00:36:48,482
Mind your own business.
Get out, or I’ll take off all my clothes.

328
00:36:48,572 --> 00:36:50,981
Go ahead.

329
00:36:51,994 --> 00:36:55,198
- What does this mean?
- What?

330
00:36:58,043 --> 00:37:01,793
It's an electrical formula.
You wouldn’t understand it.

331
00:37:01,881 --> 00:37:03,874
I'm not stupid!

332
00:37:03,967 --> 00:37:06,210
Bye.

333
00:37:17,401 --> 00:37:19,774
"The Joule effect... "

334
00:37:21,281 --> 00:37:24,117
"The creation of heat... "

335
00:37:35,215 --> 00:37:38,632
Electrocution

336
00:37:58,203 --> 00:38:00,909
- Hello.
- I'll have these.

337
00:38:01,749 --> 00:38:03,374
That's 5,000 yen.

338
00:38:06,339 --> 00:38:09,340
I got it!

339
00:38:10,052 --> 00:38:15,759
The shochu you wanted.

340
00:38:16,059 --> 00:38:20,473
Do you know how hard it was
to get it out of the store?

341
00:38:20,565 --> 00:38:24,480
Fine. I'll pay you what it’s worth.

342
00:38:25,238 --> 00:38:28,489
But you drink bourbon.

343
00:38:28,575 --> 00:38:31,114
Why do you want shochu?

344
00:39:19,474 --> 00:39:21,514
Can I come in?

345
00:39:21,601 --> 00:39:23,844
No.

346
00:39:24,063 --> 00:39:26,637
I'm reading a dirty book.

347
00:39:26,733 --> 00:39:29,225
Dinner's ready.

348
00:39:30,613 --> 00:39:33,105
I'll be right there.

349
00:39:46,717 --> 00:39:50,846
No one would ever suspect
that these were the tools of murder.

350
00:39:52,266 --> 00:39:58,056
It's simple-
that way it won't attract attention.

351
00:40:00,443 --> 00:40:03,647
The law books really helped.

352
00:40:03,739 --> 00:40:08,781
They told me who I will be up against.

353
00:40:11,206 --> 00:40:14,374
This is basically a test of imagination.

354
00:40:15,670 --> 00:40:18,458
Do I have to go through with it?

355
00:40:20,176 --> 00:40:22,383
I guess so.

356
00:40:22,888 --> 00:40:27,635
I may have nightmares every night
starting tomorrow.

357
00:40:32,275 --> 00:40:37,318
Maybe I'll talkin my sleep,
just like Noriko's dog.

358
00:40:38,700 --> 00:40:41,867
"I'm not human... "

359
00:40:43,998 --> 00:40:48,626
There are some things
you can’t laugh about.

360
00:41:43,700 --> 00:41:47,912
- Good morning.
- Where's your bike?

361
00:41:47,997 --> 00:41:52,743
It's a road racer.
Anyway, I took the train.

362
00:41:52,836 --> 00:41:56,289
Were we on the same train?

363
00:41:56,382 --> 00:41:58,672
Yes.

364
00:41:58,760 --> 00:42:01,383
I didn't see you.

365
00:42:04,560 --> 00:42:07,347
Roll call.

366
00:42:07,438 --> 00:42:10,357
Grade 11A?

367
00:42:12,528 --> 00:42:15,020
Good.

368
00:42:23,167 --> 00:42:25,326
Where are you going?

369
00:42:25,461 --> 00:42:27,122
Outside.

370
00:49:02,552 --> 00:49:05,340
Finally! Where have you been?

371
00:49:05,431 --> 00:49:08,266
I told you I was painting outside.

372
00:49:09,185 --> 00:49:12,353
- You got a lot of work done.
- Yeah...

373
00:49:22,995 --> 00:49:28,287
- Aren’t you going to eat?
- I'm not really hungry.

374
00:49:44,772 --> 00:49:48,024
- Did you report this?
- Yes.

375
00:49:48,110 --> 00:49:51,895
Why don’t you tell me what happened?

376
00:49:52,991 --> 00:49:57,322
Shuichi? How many people
are there in your family?

377
00:49:57,747 --> 00:50:03,419
Three. There's me,
my mom, and my kid sister.

378
00:50:03,546 --> 00:50:07,166
- And your dad.
- No...

379
00:50:07,426 --> 00:50:11,508
My dad died in a car accident
when I was younger.

380
00:50:13,059 --> 00:50:17,437
Then who died here today?

381
00:50:17,773 --> 00:50:20,347
Sone Takashi.

382
00:50:20,944 --> 00:50:25,406
My mom married him,
and then they got divorced.

383
00:50:25,908 --> 00:50:29,907
Did he stay here after the divorce?

384
00:50:29,997 --> 00:50:34,541
No. He just turned up
and moved back in.

385
00:50:34,628 --> 00:50:37,499
He moved back in with you?

386
00:50:45,684 --> 00:50:48,851
Where's your mom now?

387
00:50:48,938 --> 00:50:53,897
She works in a friend's
decorating store.

388
00:50:55,530 --> 00:50:59,694
While you and your sister
were in school today-

389
00:50:59,785 --> 00:51:03,369
- was Sone here by himself?

390
00:51:04,374 --> 00:51:07,246
As far as I know.

391
00:51:10,340 --> 00:51:14,386
This blood-pressure monitor
keeps a record.

392
00:51:14,470 --> 00:51:18,006
- You turn it on...
- I have one just like it.

393
00:51:19,685 --> 00:51:23,020
Have you ever seen one of these?

394
00:51:23,983 --> 00:51:26,937
I think it's my mom's.

395
00:51:27,779 --> 00:51:29,856
Shuichi!

396
00:51:30,616 --> 00:51:33,024
What's happened?

397
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:35,658
Mom...

398
00:51:36,707 --> 00:51:39,329
Sone's dead.

399
00:51:41,213 --> 00:51:44,049
Dead?!

400
00:51:45,552 --> 00:51:48,388
What happened?

401
00:51:56,900 --> 00:52:00,186
I don’t know.

402
00:52:05,703 --> 00:52:09,203
My name’s Yamamoto.

403
00:52:11,919 --> 00:52:15,170
Can I ask you some questions?

404
00:52:15,256 --> 00:52:18,792
Is this your blood-pressure monitor?

405
00:52:18,886 --> 00:52:21,674
Yes, that's mine.

406
00:52:21,765 --> 00:52:26,724
We found it in Sone's room.
Did you lend it to him?

407
00:52:26,896 --> 00:52:30,064
- No.
- You didn't?

408
00:52:30,568 --> 00:52:36,156
The monitor keeps a record
of every test.

409
00:52:36,242 --> 00:52:40,157
I know that for a fact.
I have one of these myself.

410
00:52:40,330 --> 00:52:43,332
Look at this.

411
00:52:44,168 --> 00:52:48,915
That's not my blood-pressure.
And I was at work.

412
00:52:49,842 --> 00:52:54,506
Maybe Sone took
his own blood-pressure?

413
00:52:55,391 --> 00:52:57,680
I guess so.

414
00:52:57,769 --> 00:53:00,343
I see.

415
00:53:00,439 --> 00:53:02,729
Excuse me.

416
00:53:33,769 --> 00:53:36,059
You're dripping.

417
00:53:36,147 --> 00:53:38,983
What? Oh.

418
00:53:42,572 --> 00:53:45,028
You're still up...

419
00:53:45,451 --> 00:53:48,453
I'm still wide awake.

420
00:53:50,040 --> 00:53:52,958
I haven’t been feeling well-

421
00:53:53,044 --> 00:53:57,422
- ever since Sone turned up
and made things difficult for us.

422
00:53:59,844 --> 00:54:05,220
I know it’s been hard on you.
I just want to...

423
00:54:05,310 --> 00:54:08,145
He's dead.

424
00:54:09,023 --> 00:54:11,514
It's over.

425
00:54:16,240 --> 00:54:19,076
Shuichi...

426
00:54:28,089 --> 00:54:31,790
...just tell me one thing.

427
00:54:34,680 --> 00:54:41,930
The police told me you took
the train to school today.

428
00:54:44,526 --> 00:54:47,611
I did?

429
00:54:48,323 --> 00:54:51,408
Maybe I did.

430
00:54:51,494 --> 00:54:54,495
I can’t remember.

431
00:54:55,958 --> 00:54:58,710
You can't?

432
00:55:00,964 --> 00:55:04,381
Why do you ask?

433
00:55:08,724 --> 00:55:13,471
I'm going to bed.
You should do the same.

434
00:55:15,900 --> 00:55:20,729
You're right. I will. Good night.

435
00:55:21,699 --> 00:55:24,701
Good night.

436
00:55:52,238 --> 00:55:54,231
I'm not a dog

437
00:56:05,004 --> 00:56:09,667
- Where are you going with that?
- I’ll finish it at home.

438
00:56:09,760 --> 00:56:12,513
Why can’t you finish it here?

439
00:56:12,597 --> 00:56:15,884
It shouldn’t matter where I do it.

440
00:56:48,184 --> 00:56:50,854
The police called.

441
00:56:52,607 --> 00:56:58,777
He died of natural causes.
They want us to pick up the body.

442
00:56:59,157 --> 00:57:01,945
Mom, we're eating.

443
00:57:31,156 --> 00:57:35,404
Time's up. Pass your papers forward.

444
00:57:45,007 --> 00:57:47,499
Where's your umbrella?

445
00:57:47,719 --> 00:57:52,263
- Somebody took it.
- Really? That's too bad.

446
00:58:05,825 --> 00:58:09,658
- Did you bring your bike?
- It's a road racer! Here.

447
00:58:09,789 --> 00:58:12,743
- Thanks.
- It was raining this morning.

448
00:58:14,878 --> 00:58:18,165
You've been acting strange lately.

449
00:58:18,258 --> 00:58:20,796
In what way?

450
00:58:20,886 --> 00:58:25,964
- You never come to Art Club...
- You've been skipping out on that, too.

451
00:58:26,059 --> 00:58:32,349
I had to today.
There's something wrong with my dog.

452
00:58:32,901 --> 00:58:37,280
I told you about him.
He talks in his sleep.

453
00:58:37,365 --> 00:58:40,035
I remember that.

454
00:58:41,454 --> 00:58:45,785
- Can I ask you something?
- What?

455
00:58:45,876 --> 00:58:49,827
Where did you go to
during art class the other day?

456
00:58:50,007 --> 00:58:53,792
I went outside. The weather was nice.

457
00:58:53,887 --> 00:58:56,046
You're lying.

458
00:58:56,139 --> 00:59:01,218
I went outside, but you weren't there.

459
00:59:06,319 --> 00:59:08,775
Question number two:

460
00:59:08,906 --> 00:59:14,946
Why was your painting dry
when you got back?

461
00:59:15,122 --> 00:59:17,115
- It was?
- Yes.

462
00:59:17,208 --> 00:59:20,660
I don’t remember that.

463
00:59:26,553 --> 00:59:31,133
Question number three: Have you
looked at your painting recently?

464
00:59:31,226 --> 00:59:32,851
No.

465
00:59:32,936 --> 00:59:38,394
You should.
Especially on a rainy day like this.

466
00:59:38,485 --> 00:59:41,855
- Why?
- You might want to think about that.

467
00:59:50,876 --> 00:59:53,913
- Thanks for the umbrella.
- See you later. Get going.

468
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:44,750
- You again...
- Can't I come in here?

469
01:01:44,838 --> 01:01:49,882
- I need a favor from you.
- You're not getting your knife back.

470
01:01:50,012 --> 01:01:53,513
That's not it. I need to
borrow some money from you.

471
01:01:53,684 --> 01:01:57,385
- Money?
- I need 300,000 yen.

472
01:01:57,480 --> 01:01:59,853
You're out of your mind.

473
01:01:59,942 --> 01:02:03,988
You shouldn’t be so quick to say no...

474
01:02:04,073 --> 01:02:06,778
...to someone who knows your secret.

475
01:02:06,868 --> 01:02:08,826
Secret?

476
01:02:08,912 --> 01:02:13,208
Don’t play dumb with me... "Dad-killer".

477
01:02:22,264 --> 01:02:25,716
I saw you close to the school that day.

478
01:02:25,810 --> 01:02:29,394
I followed you on my motorbike.

479
01:02:29,482 --> 01:02:32,437
You didn't see me.

480
01:02:32,527 --> 01:02:37,986
You went home, came back out again,
and then you hid your little toy.

481
01:02:38,076 --> 01:02:43,702
- So you're the one who took it...
- Yeah, I'll exchange it for my knife.

482
01:02:43,792 --> 01:02:47,578
I didn't know what it was for at first.

483
01:02:47,673 --> 01:02:51,672
Then I heard that your old man
had died from a heart attack-

484
01:02:51,761 --> 01:02:54,597
- and that’s when I pieced it together.

485
01:02:54,682 --> 01:02:57,600
Do you want me to go on?

486
01:03:04,153 --> 01:03:08,698
What's so funny?
Do you find me amusing?

487
01:03:08,868 --> 01:03:14,659
It's always pissed me off
how you think you're so damn smart...

488
01:03:15,001 --> 01:03:20,839
You think you know everything,
and that the rest of us are stupid.

489
01:03:20,925 --> 01:03:25,221
You only help people
so you can feel superior to them.

490
01:03:42,705 --> 01:03:45,660
Don’t think I won't do anything.

491
01:03:45,750 --> 01:03:48,421
You killed your old man in cold blood.

492
01:03:48,504 --> 01:03:53,547
What happens when you're like me,
gasping for breath...

493
01:03:53,636 --> 01:03:56,673
...and begging for help?

494
01:03:58,684 --> 01:04:01,805
- 300,000?
- Yeah.

495
01:04:01,897 --> 01:04:04,436
All right.

496
01:04:04,525 --> 01:04:08,821
But I don’t have it now.
I need some time.

497
01:04:09,198 --> 01:04:13,032
- How much time?
- A week.

498
01:04:14,288 --> 01:04:19,711
Fine, a week. But don't try to run.

499
01:04:21,089 --> 01:04:26,334
Where would I run?

500
01:04:26,930 --> 01:04:30,846
I have nowhere to go.

501
01:04:34,315 --> 01:04:37,935
No juice today?

502
01:04:38,070 --> 01:04:41,737
No. I shouldn’t take advantage of you.

503
01:04:57,263 --> 01:04:59,933
Shuichi? I'm coming in.

504
01:05:01,310 --> 01:05:03,599
Are you hiding again?

505
01:05:03,688 --> 01:05:06,643
You can't just barge in here.
I've told you that.

506
01:05:06,734 --> 01:05:10,068
Mom will be home late.
I'm making dinner.

507
01:05:10,155 --> 01:05:13,110
What do you want?

508
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:17,113
- An ostrich-egg omelet.
- You got it.

509
01:05:19,250 --> 01:05:23,415
Well? Go find me an ostrich.

510
01:05:29,764 --> 01:05:34,642
Is it true
that I'm not really your sister?

511
01:05:36,273 --> 01:05:39,975
Who told you that?

512
01:05:40,070 --> 01:05:44,532
He did- Sone Takashi.

513
01:05:44,618 --> 01:05:49,328
That's bullshit.
You don’t believe him, do you?

514
01:05:51,293 --> 01:05:55,838
Do you remember the night
I went to the bathroom-

515
01:05:55,966 --> 01:05:58,885
- and he was out in the hallway?

516
01:05:59,930 --> 01:06:04,474
He told me that night-

517
01:06:04,561 --> 01:06:09,984
- that I was his daughter
and that he was dying of cancer.

518
01:06:10,068 --> 01:06:13,189
He had come back to see me.

519
01:06:13,281 --> 01:06:16,734
Cancer? He told you that?

520
01:06:19,539 --> 01:06:22,874
Why didn’t you tell me?

521
01:06:23,670 --> 01:06:26,209
I'm sorry.

522
01:06:31,055 --> 01:06:35,968
Is it true
that I'm not really your sister?

523
01:06:38,565 --> 01:06:41,235
You're my baby sister.

524
01:06:41,319 --> 01:06:44,439
Stop worrying.

525
01:06:53,126 --> 01:06:58,834
Hurry up and get dinner ready.
Chicken eggs will be fine.

526
01:07:02,096 --> 01:07:05,930
I'll be right back.

527
01:07:37,811 --> 01:07:44,432
He had cancer...
He would have died anyway.

528
01:07:47,908 --> 01:07:51,693
I'm such an idiot.

529
01:07:55,209 --> 01:07:57,915
- Well?
- I don’t have it yet.

530
01:07:58,005 --> 01:08:02,964
What? You asked me to wait a week,
and I did.

531
01:08:05,389 --> 01:08:08,890
I've thought of a way to get it.

532
01:08:10,438 --> 01:08:12,727
A robbery.

533
01:08:12,858 --> 01:08:15,776
A robbery?
What are you going to rob?

534
01:08:15,862 --> 01:08:19,398
Not me-you.

535
01:08:22,537 --> 01:08:26,406
Hang on.
I'm the one blackmailing you.

536
01:08:26,501 --> 01:08:29,456
Why should I commit a robbery?

537
01:08:31,716 --> 01:08:37,507
You'll rob my convenience store.
I'll be the only one there.

538
01:08:37,599 --> 01:08:40,850
You're kidding.

539
01:08:41,646 --> 01:08:45,313
We'll both be in on it. Don’t worry.

540
01:08:46,069 --> 01:08:48,027
But they’ve got cameras.

541
01:08:48,155 --> 01:08:53,495
The picture quality is terrible.
They won't be able to identify you.

542
01:08:56,583 --> 01:08:59,620
And you won't go to the cops?

543
01:08:59,712 --> 01:09:02,334
Of course not.

544
01:09:02,883 --> 01:09:07,796
No, I guess not.
You killed your old man.

545
01:09:09,058 --> 01:09:13,306
I'm curious-
how much cash are we talking?

546
01:09:13,856 --> 01:09:20,691
- Almost a million yen, I think.
- Really?!

547
01:09:21,616 --> 01:09:25,402
- Did you see his bones?
- No.

548
01:09:25,497 --> 01:09:28,534
You didn't? I'm sorry.

549
01:09:28,626 --> 01:09:31,711
I guess we'll all end up
as nothing but bones.

550
01:09:31,797 --> 01:09:37,422
How would you like it if your bones
were on displayin a hundred years?

551
01:09:37,513 --> 01:09:40,799
That would be embarrassing.

552
01:09:41,226 --> 01:09:47,183
Say something.
You remember what I said?

553
01:09:47,276 --> 01:09:50,978
Yeah. I'll call you if the plan changes.

554
01:09:51,406 --> 01:09:54,278
- Can I use this knife?
- No.

555
01:09:56,580 --> 01:09:59,154
Use this one.

556
01:09:59,918 --> 01:10:03,454
That's my knife. I'm not using that!

557
01:10:03,548 --> 01:10:06,715
It's a copy. I've made it.

558
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:09,638
- No shit?
- Don’t touch the blade!

559
01:10:09,722 --> 01:10:14,220
Keep it in the sheath
until it's time to use it.

560
01:10:14,312 --> 01:10:18,014
Wow! It looks just like the real one.

561
01:10:18,609 --> 01:10:21,944
Put it away, you moron!

562
01:10:25,118 --> 01:10:29,947
It's a good thing it's the store's money
and not yours.

563
01:10:31,418 --> 01:10:34,835
Cheer up. I'll get it right.

564
01:10:34,923 --> 01:10:38,507
- Save your sympathy.
- I'm sorry.

565
01:10:38,594 --> 01:10:43,424
When I get the money,
I'll be able to get my own place.

566
01:10:44,018 --> 01:10:48,183
Free at last, thanks to you.

567
01:10:50,569 --> 01:10:54,354
Let's get some dinner.

568
01:10:54,449 --> 01:10:56,857
I have to work.

569
01:10:56,952 --> 01:10:59,195
Tonight, too?

570
01:10:59,289 --> 01:11:03,288
I'll check out the place,
so we know it'll work.

571
01:11:03,378 --> 01:11:09,085
- You'll be up all night.
- I can't sleep anyway.

572
01:11:54,154 --> 01:11:58,402
Wake up, Haruka. This isn’t your room.

573
01:12:01,247 --> 01:12:04,083
Did you kill him?

574
01:12:21,274 --> 01:12:26,020
Yeah, I killed him.

575
01:12:29,242 --> 01:12:31,781
That's what I thought.

576
01:12:46,516 --> 01:12:48,556
Hello.

577
01:12:49,102 --> 01:12:51,226
The money.

578
01:12:52,857 --> 01:12:55,895
Give me the money. Now!

579
01:12:56,487 --> 01:12:59,062
Hurry up!

580
01:12:59,491 --> 01:13:02,066
- How am I doing?
- Shut up.

581
01:13:02,871 --> 01:13:05,197
Give me the money!

582
01:13:08,879 --> 01:13:11,371
You bastard!

583
01:13:12,133 --> 01:13:14,376
What?

584
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:17,175
Let go!

585
01:13:22,772 --> 01:13:25,858
This isn't how we planned it.

586
01:13:32,702 --> 01:13:35,194
Let go!

587
01:13:43,592 --> 01:13:46,000
Shuichi...

588
01:13:46,095 --> 01:13:48,302
Why?

589
01:13:48,557 --> 01:13:51,429
Why?

590
01:15:14,797 --> 01:15:16,791
Get lost!

591
01:15:18,803 --> 01:15:21,176
Get out of here!

592
01:15:37,202 --> 01:15:39,611
You’ll feel better.

593
01:15:41,750 --> 01:15:44,372
Can't eat?

594
01:15:45,964 --> 01:15:49,251
So we meet again...

595
01:15:49,969 --> 01:15:54,598
First Mr. Sone, and now this robber.

596
01:15:54,684 --> 01:15:57,721
Take this, please.

597
01:15:58,022 --> 01:16:00,478
You've had it rough.

598
01:16:00,567 --> 01:16:03,403
Let me get this clear...

599
01:16:03,488 --> 01:16:07,652
When did you realize
that it was Ishioka Takuya?

600
01:16:08,995 --> 01:16:12,412
When his helmet came off.

601
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:15,371
When he was on the floor.

602
01:16:15,462 --> 01:16:20,706
That's not what you said
when you called the police.

603
01:16:21,470 --> 01:16:25,386
Why didn’t you say
that you knew him?

604
01:16:26,727 --> 01:16:31,854
I really don’t know.
I couldn’t think straight.

605
01:16:35,030 --> 01:16:38,067
I see.

606
01:16:38,993 --> 01:16:41,781
I can understand that.

607
01:16:43,124 --> 01:16:48,037
That's it for tonight.
You must be tired.

608
01:16:48,131 --> 01:16:51,999
But I'll want to talk to you tomorrow.

609
01:16:52,553 --> 01:16:55,472
- Can I go?
- Yes.

610
01:17:39,950 --> 01:17:42,868
Can I try that?

611
01:17:44,080 --> 01:17:47,082
- Do you think you can do it?
- Sure.

612
01:17:47,794 --> 01:17:50,368
I've always wanted to try it.

613
01:17:50,506 --> 01:17:54,552
- Don’t fall.
- I'll be fine.

614
01:17:54,636 --> 01:18:00,724
You're not very athletic.
Can you put your feet down?

615
01:18:04,650 --> 01:18:07,735
Take it easy.

616
01:18:15,664 --> 01:18:19,616
- Did you sleep well?
- Not really.

617
01:18:20,629 --> 01:18:23,168
Come in and have a seat.

618
01:18:23,258 --> 01:18:28,171
We'll get this over with
as soon as possible.

619
01:18:40,322 --> 01:18:42,993
To be frank-

620
01:18:43,076 --> 01:18:49,413
- I think it's odd
that you and Ishioka were classmates.

621
01:18:50,670 --> 01:18:56,757
- Do you think we planned this?
- No, I doubt it.

622
01:18:56,845 --> 01:19:00,464
This probably wouldn’t
have happened then.

623
01:19:00,558 --> 01:19:05,767
You knew there wasn't
much money in the store.

624
01:19:08,193 --> 01:19:11,361
I want to show you something.

625
01:19:22,921 --> 01:19:26,338
Do you notice anything strange?

626
01:19:27,177 --> 01:19:30,381
Not really.

627
01:19:30,473 --> 01:19:36,478
Ishioka comes into the store
and walks right over to you.

628
01:19:36,564 --> 01:19:40,065
A person who's about
to rob the place-

629
01:19:40,152 --> 01:19:46,193
- would look around to see
if there are any customers around.

630
01:19:46,286 --> 01:19:49,288
A customer could be a problem.

631
01:19:49,373 --> 01:19:53,372
We almost never have customers
at that hour.

632
01:19:53,462 --> 01:19:57,710
That's right,
but how did Ishioka know that?

633
01:19:58,844 --> 01:20:02,760
I don’t know, but apparently he did.

634
01:20:04,143 --> 01:20:06,551
"Apparently he did... "

635
01:20:17,619 --> 01:20:19,197
There!

636
01:20:19,288 --> 01:20:24,533
It looks like the knife was up
against your neck. Was it?

637
01:20:24,629 --> 01:20:27,500
I really don’t remember.

638
01:20:27,591 --> 01:20:32,800
Look at it! It looks like he's
pressing it against your neck.

639
01:20:32,890 --> 01:20:36,971
But you don’t have a mark on you.

640
01:20:39,774 --> 01:20:43,725
I don’t think
it was actually on my neck.

641
01:20:43,821 --> 01:20:49,446
Probably not. It wasn’t a toy, was it?

642
01:20:53,417 --> 01:20:56,289
You're very brave.

643
01:20:56,379 --> 01:21:01,589
Most people wouldn't dare
take on someone with a knife.

644
01:21:04,432 --> 01:21:07,102
Watch closely.

645
01:21:07,227 --> 01:21:13,149
His feet aren’t moving here.
Then they start twitching.

646
01:21:13,235 --> 01:21:18,113
Now they move less and less...

647
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:23,408
...and here they stop moving.

648
01:21:23,499 --> 01:21:27,997
- Isn’t that odd?
- What?

649
01:21:28,089 --> 01:21:34,509
I thought the knife went into Ishioka
when you both fell.

650
01:21:34,597 --> 01:21:41,349
But after looking at the tape,
I think I may have been wrong.

651
01:21:44,277 --> 01:21:47,694
I don't understand what you mean.

652
01:21:47,782 --> 01:21:51,068
Right after he falls...

653
01:21:51,161 --> 01:21:55,741
...his feet aren’t moving
as if he’d been stabbed.

654
01:21:55,834 --> 01:22:00,747
Then they freeze and start twitching.

655
01:22:01,049 --> 01:22:04,550
The logical assumption here would be-

656
01:22:04,638 --> 01:22:10,144
- that his feet froze
right as the knife went in.

657
01:22:12,440 --> 01:22:15,395
What do you mean?

658
01:22:15,485 --> 01:22:20,149
Do you think I took the knife from him
and used it to kill him?

659
01:22:20,242 --> 01:22:23,694
Even it that were true,
it would still be self-defense.

660
01:22:23,788 --> 01:22:25,947
That's crazy.

661
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:30,919
How would I have been able
to get the knife away from him-

662
01:22:31,006 --> 01:22:33,580
- without getting
so much as a scratch?

663
01:22:33,676 --> 01:22:36,714
You're quite right.

664
01:22:36,889 --> 01:22:43,938
But there are too many holes
in your story.

665
01:22:44,649 --> 01:22:50,737
For one thing, we didn’t find a sheath.

666
01:22:50,824 --> 01:22:57,790
It's a sharp, doubled-edged knife.
He wouldn't carry it around like that.

667
01:22:58,167 --> 01:22:59,876
Would he?

668
01:22:59,962 --> 01:23:05,587
And we found a folding knife
in his back pocket.

669
01:23:05,678 --> 01:23:10,555
Don’t you find it weird
that he brought two knifes-

670
01:23:10,643 --> 01:23:13,847
- to rob a convenience store?

671
01:23:25,913 --> 01:23:29,117
Cool bike!

672
01:23:29,209 --> 01:23:32,626
It's not a bike, it's a road racer.

673
01:23:32,714 --> 01:23:35,384
It's really nice.

674
01:23:35,467 --> 01:23:38,754
Can I try it?

675
01:23:39,514 --> 01:23:41,757
Sure.

676
01:23:42,185 --> 01:23:45,222
It's so light.

677
01:23:47,025 --> 01:23:49,861
You lean forward...

678
01:24:01,377 --> 01:24:03,785
Kushimori.

679
01:24:03,880 --> 01:24:06,088
Come here.

680
01:24:18,942 --> 01:24:22,359
I was going
to drop by your house later.

681
01:24:23,198 --> 01:24:26,568
I thought you'd take the day off.

682
01:24:27,120 --> 01:24:29,362
Have a seat.

683
01:24:31,376 --> 01:24:34,627
You didn’t have to show up today.

684
01:24:34,755 --> 01:24:38,457
Why should I miss school?

685
01:24:39,845 --> 01:24:43,796
Why should I miss school? Answer me!

686
01:24:43,892 --> 01:24:47,428
Kushimori! Watch it.

687
01:24:47,522 --> 01:24:50,809
Mr. Inukai's not making any sense.

688
01:24:50,902 --> 01:24:54,901
Is that anyway to talk to a teacher?

689
01:24:54,990 --> 01:25:00,283
- Think about it.
- What should I think about?

690
01:25:00,790 --> 01:25:04,326
One of your classmates is dead, and...

691
01:25:04,420 --> 01:25:08,715
- And it's my fault?
- Maybe not in a legal sense...

692
01:25:08,801 --> 01:25:12,253
- But in a moral sense?
- I didn't say that!

693
01:25:12,347 --> 01:25:14,803
Please, Mr. Konaka...

694
01:25:14,892 --> 01:25:17,930
It must’ve been hard on him.

695
01:25:20,149 --> 01:25:24,647
He tried to kill me!
Do you want me to feel sorry for him?

696
01:25:24,739 --> 01:25:29,817
I don't think he wanted to kill you.
He was just after the money.

697
01:25:29,912 --> 01:25:33,958
Did Ishioka talk about this
with any of you?

698
01:25:34,043 --> 01:25:35,751
What?!

699
01:25:35,837 --> 01:25:39,587
Then how do you know
what he meant to do?!

700
01:25:40,176 --> 01:25:45,005
Ishioka Takuya came into the store
where I was working.

701
01:25:45,099 --> 01:25:48,054
He pulled out a knife
and demanded money.

702
01:25:48,145 --> 01:25:53,853
We struggled, he fell,
the knife went in, and he died.

703
01:25:54,278 --> 01:25:57,980
There's no reason
I shouldn’t be in school.

704
01:26:00,537 --> 01:26:03,325
Excuse me.

705
01:26:09,298 --> 01:26:13,796
I'm sorry I raised my voice.
I'll get to class.

706
01:27:03,454 --> 01:27:08,581
I haven't seen you
in the Art Club room for a while.

707
01:27:11,840 --> 01:27:14,712
Are you leaving already?

708
01:27:14,803 --> 01:27:17,758
- He died.
- What?

709
01:27:17,848 --> 01:27:23,770
- My dog. Early this morning.
- Yeah?

710
01:27:23,856 --> 01:27:28,436
I didn’t hear the last words
he said in his sleep.

711
01:27:43,967 --> 01:27:47,752
Screw Art Club. Let's get out of here.

712
01:27:54,147 --> 01:27:57,398
Have a seat.

713
01:28:15,258 --> 01:28:19,340
Tell me about your dog.

714
01:28:19,431 --> 01:28:22,931
- Like what?
- Anything.

715
01:28:27,900 --> 01:28:31,602
Sometimes he talked in his sleep.

716
01:28:33,867 --> 01:28:37,284
I know that. What else?

717
01:28:43,338 --> 01:28:46,957
He was hairier than me.

718
01:28:47,051 --> 01:28:50,421
I figured that.

719
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:58,687
I'm actually being serious.

720
01:29:01,153 --> 01:29:06,113
I just can't put it into words.

721
01:29:08,163 --> 01:29:14,285
I don't want to remember his color
or how big he was.

722
01:29:14,421 --> 01:29:19,713
I don’t want to be
like some TV digest-

723
01:29:19,803 --> 01:29:24,383
- Looking back
on all the superficial details.

724
01:29:26,854 --> 01:29:32,942
He'd gone cold this morning.
That's what I thought then.

725
01:29:36,033 --> 01:29:40,578
Do you think it’s silly?

726
01:29:43,043 --> 01:29:46,495
How did he die?

727
01:29:48,425 --> 01:29:52,590
Do you really want to know?

728
01:30:08,994 --> 01:30:12,245
What's this?

729
01:30:12,332 --> 01:30:15,536
The parts to my old road racer.

730
01:30:15,628 --> 01:30:21,051
So it comes apart like that,
piece by piece?

731
01:30:21,219 --> 01:30:23,627
Cool.

732
01:30:23,722 --> 01:30:28,516
It makes it look
like the bike hanged itself.

733
01:30:33,610 --> 01:30:36,529
What?

734
01:30:38,867 --> 01:30:41,953
I should be going home.

735
01:30:43,582 --> 01:30:49,836
Hang on! You just go there.
Have a cup of tea at least.

736
01:30:56,975 --> 01:30:59,431
No, thanks. See you.

737
01:30:59,520 --> 01:31:03,601
- Don't go!
- Let go of me.

738
01:31:03,692 --> 01:31:06,694
Are you that scared of me?

739
01:31:06,780 --> 01:31:10,446
If you are, then say so!

740
01:31:17,169 --> 01:31:19,660
Just go!

741
01:31:19,881 --> 01:31:22,088
Get out of here.

742
01:33:38,441 --> 01:33:41,941
<i>- Favorite things?
- Yeah, anything.</i>

743
01:33:42,029 --> 01:33:47,238
<i>I write it down when I think of it.</i>

744
01:33:47,411 --> 01:33:50,413
<i>- Like what?
- Like...</i>

745
01:33:50,999 --> 01:33:56,126
<i>No, I'm not telling you.
You won’t tell me anything important.</i>

746
01:33:56,215 --> 01:34:01,128
<i>But if you write it down,
it's amazing how calm you get.</i>

747
01:34:01,221 --> 01:34:04,426
<i>What if you can’t think of anything?</i>

748
01:34:04,559 --> 01:34:08,938
<i>Write a list of things you hate,
and then burn it.</i>

749
01:34:19,079 --> 01:34:21,321
See you.

750
01:34:23,251 --> 01:34:25,921
I...

751
01:34:27,131 --> 01:34:30,335
...have killed someone.

752
01:34:31,011 --> 01:34:34,049
I see.

753
01:36:06,180 --> 01:36:11,722
When Sone died
and I first talked to Shuichi-

754
01:36:11,813 --> 01:36:18,103
- I assumed
that he was Shuichi's father.

755
01:36:19,365 --> 01:36:25,037
When I mentioned that,
he firmly denied it.

756
01:36:26,082 --> 01:36:31,078
That was something that struck me.

757
01:36:34,260 --> 01:36:40,015
When Sone came back
and wanted to live with you...

758
01:36:40,101 --> 01:36:43,685
...why did you let him in?

759
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:52,947
Shuichi's liked drawing
ever since he was little.

760
01:36:54,370 --> 01:36:58,286
He would draw pictures
of Haruka and me.

761
01:36:59,585 --> 01:37:03,999
One time he drew a picture of Sone-

762
01:37:04,091 --> 01:37:09,051
- with his head inside a lion's mouth.

763
01:37:11,101 --> 01:37:17,900
He said the lion had a bad tooth
and that Sone was pulling it out.

764
01:37:19,904 --> 01:37:23,072
It was the only time
he drew a picture of Sone-

765
01:37:23,158 --> 01:37:26,575
- and the first time he lied to me.

766
01:37:29,500 --> 01:37:32,835
I shouldn’t have let Sone in.

767
01:37:33,464 --> 01:37:36,170
I knew that...

768
01:37:38,596 --> 01:37:41,681
...but it just happened.

769
01:37:47,733 --> 01:37:51,352
My brother’s busy.
Can you come back later?

770
01:37:51,446 --> 01:37:55,944
- Fine, I'll come.
- Ignore them!

771
01:37:56,036 --> 01:37:58,658
Don’t worry. I'll be right back.

772
01:37:58,748 --> 01:38:02,165
- I'll call Mom.
- Haruka!

773
01:38:02,795 --> 01:38:05,963
Please don't do that.

774
01:38:08,928 --> 01:38:11,716
No, Shuichi. Don't go!

775
01:38:11,807 --> 01:38:16,102
It's fine. I'll be right back.

776
01:38:16,188 --> 01:38:18,726
Do your homework.

777
01:38:19,609 --> 01:38:22,646
- Shuichi!
- Let's go.

778
01:38:22,738 --> 01:38:24,815
Shuichi!

779
01:38:34,754 --> 01:38:41,008
The day that Sone died,
you left your art class.

780
01:38:43,683 --> 01:38:49,688
<i>Sone was completely wasted,
and you electrocuted him.</i>

781
01:38:56,742 --> 01:38:59,863
<i>You used the blood-pressure monitor
to check-</i>

782
01:38:59,955 --> 01:39:05,331
<i>- but the heat loosened
a crown from Mr. Sone's teeth.</i>

783
01:39:07,590 --> 01:39:13,132
<i>We found the transformer and
the wire you used at Ishioka's home.</i>

784
01:39:13,222 --> 01:39:17,933
Maybe Ishioka found out
and threatened to expose you.

785
01:39:20,065 --> 01:39:24,527
<i>You would've had to shut him up.</i>

786
01:39:34,793 --> 01:39:39,373
Shouldn’t you just come clean?

787
01:39:41,719 --> 01:39:47,344
All right.
I'll tell you everything tomorrow.

788
01:39:47,727 --> 01:39:51,227
This is the police
you're talking to, kid!

789
01:39:52,775 --> 01:39:55,481
Why tomorrow?

790
01:39:55,654 --> 01:39:59,570
So I can say goodbye to my friends.

791
01:40:00,160 --> 01:40:02,830
If that's okay...

792
01:40:02,914 --> 01:40:08,372
All right...
You promise you'll come back?

793
01:40:11,050 --> 01:40:14,254
- Yes.
- All right.

794
01:40:15,639 --> 01:40:18,427
I'll trust you.

795
01:40:19,645 --> 01:40:23,691
Tomorrow. I'll be waiting here.

796
01:40:33,330 --> 01:40:36,166
So...

797
01:40:36,751 --> 01:40:39,290
Did you buy one?

798
01:40:39,379 --> 01:40:42,714
That road racer. Did you buy it?

799
01:40:42,801 --> 01:40:46,716
Yes, I actually did. How did you know?

800
01:40:46,806 --> 01:40:50,639
I saw you on the beach.

801
01:40:50,728 --> 01:40:53,398
You did?

802
01:40:53,481 --> 01:40:56,020
Did you see me?

803
01:40:56,110 --> 01:40:58,649
They're expensive!

804
01:40:58,739 --> 01:41:02,440
I almost fainted
when I found out how much they cost.

805
01:41:02,535 --> 01:41:07,329
I had promised to buy
a game machine for my kids-

806
01:41:07,417 --> 01:41:10,335
- but I couldn't resist it.

807
01:41:10,421 --> 01:41:13,091
Why not?

808
01:41:13,175 --> 01:41:16,011
That's a good question.

809
01:41:16,095 --> 01:41:20,924
I wanted to understand you better.

810
01:42:53,809 --> 01:42:58,389
- This yogurt is good.
- It is?

811
01:42:58,482 --> 01:43:02,315
It's really nice- kiwi and orange.

812
01:43:02,404 --> 01:43:05,240
- Are you going out?
- Just for a while.

813
01:43:05,325 --> 01:43:08,362
- He's meeting a girl.
- A girl?

814
01:43:08,454 --> 01:43:12,239
- Her name is Noriko.
- How did you know that?

815
01:43:12,334 --> 01:43:17,294
- I heard you talking on the phone.
- You're just jealous.

816
01:43:17,382 --> 01:43:20,966
- Get going.
- Jerk!

817
01:43:21,847 --> 01:43:24,517
Will you be back for lunch?

818
01:43:24,642 --> 01:43:27,181
I think so.

819
01:43:27,271 --> 01:43:30,308
What do you want?

820
01:43:31,109 --> 01:43:34,064
You decide.

821
01:43:34,155 --> 01:43:37,821
But I wanted
to make you something special.

822
01:43:38,369 --> 01:43:42,415
I'm sorry. I'm going.

823
01:43:44,210 --> 01:43:46,666
Bye.

824
01:43:50,927 --> 01:43:57,050
Haruka, I'm going.
What are you mad at, stupid?

825
01:43:57,144 --> 01:44:00,015
I'm not stupid!

826
01:45:45,205 --> 01:45:48,741
- You're early.
- So are you.

827
01:45:48,835 --> 01:45:52,336
I wanted to finish this picture.

828
01:45:52,423 --> 01:45:57,134
- What is it?
- You in 30 years.

829
01:45:58,097 --> 01:46:02,975
In 30 years? I'll be 47 by then.

830
01:46:05,065 --> 01:46:08,649
What will you be like?

831
01:46:10,406 --> 01:46:14,357
I'll probably have
more flesh under my jaw.

832
01:46:14,453 --> 01:46:18,499
I'll have wrinkles
and may even be bald.

833
01:46:18,583 --> 01:46:23,876
- And a pot-belly?
- Yeah, a typical middle-aged fart.

834
01:46:23,965 --> 01:46:28,546
- With smelly feet.
- Don't overdo it.

835
01:46:37,233 --> 01:46:42,111
That cop was asking
all kinds of questions about you.

836
01:46:43,366 --> 01:46:45,905
I know.

837
01:46:45,995 --> 01:46:50,908
I was in the schoolyard
when we had art class.

838
01:46:51,669 --> 01:46:57,211
You saw me through the window
and came out to talk to me.

839
01:46:58,136 --> 01:47:01,969
- Is that what you said?
- Pretty much.

840
01:47:02,058 --> 01:47:07,434
- Why did you lie?
- I wasn't trying to help you.

841
01:47:07,524 --> 01:47:11,357
I just didn't like that cop's face.

842
01:47:11,446 --> 01:47:15,030
Daimon and Oikawa lied to him, too.

843
01:47:15,117 --> 01:47:19,199
But the cop said
that their stories didn't add up.

844
01:47:19,289 --> 01:47:23,585
They didn't like his face, either.

845
01:47:24,505 --> 01:47:31,044
Neither do I,
but he seems pretty smart.

846
01:47:33,225 --> 01:47:36,559
He'll probably get me.

847
01:47:41,653 --> 01:47:45,105
Did you really kill them?

848
01:47:48,453 --> 01:47:55,289
I can’t think of anyone
that I would want to kill.

849
01:47:56,297 --> 01:48:02,172
But I guess people
get caught up in situations-

850
01:48:02,264 --> 01:48:05,634
- where they're forced to kill.

851
01:48:19,161 --> 01:48:23,243
- You said you wanted to meet me.
- Yeah.

852
01:48:26,171 --> 01:48:30,384
- I wanted to say goodbye.
- Goodbye?

853
01:48:34,056 --> 01:48:39,397
If I get arrested, it'll be big news.

854
01:48:40,982 --> 01:48:46,025
I don’t want to cause trouble
for Mom and Haruka.

855
01:48:48,242 --> 01:48:52,407
I don’t want to mess up their future.

856
01:48:54,500 --> 01:48:58,665
It's all right. Don’t worry.

857
01:49:00,133 --> 01:49:05,888
If there's a trial, I'll stick to my story.

858
01:49:08,686 --> 01:49:11,641
Hang in there.

859
01:49:11,732 --> 01:49:15,398
Don't let them get you down.

860
01:49:15,487 --> 01:49:19,355
For your mother's sake,
and your sister's, too.

861
01:49:21,620 --> 01:49:24,194
Thanks.

862
01:49:27,294 --> 01:49:30,331
I should be going.

863
01:49:34,387 --> 01:49:37,887
I'm sorry I dragged you over here.

864
01:50:36,011 --> 01:50:39,927
<i>My favorite things... My road racer.</i>

865
01:50:40,016 --> 01:50:43,184
<i>The world-
as I see it from my road racer.</i>

866
01:50:43,271 --> 01:50:44,931
<i>Mom's cooking.</i>

867
01:50:45,023 --> 01:50:49,521
<i>Haruka's chubby face.
Daimon's lousy pictures.</i>

868
01:50:49,613 --> 01:50:51,689
<i>Oikawa's jokes.</i>

869
01:50:51,782 --> 01:50:56,446
<i>The nude sketch of Noriko.
Her dog-who talked in his sleep.</i>

870
01:50:56,539 --> 01:50:59,540
