1
00:01:16,576 --> 00:01:21,377
This is your final boarding call
for flight number 732 to Hong Kong.

2
00:01:21,648 --> 00:01:22,842
Excuse me.

3
00:01:22,916 --> 00:01:25,680
All passengers must proceed
to Gate 31A at this time.

4
00:01:25,752 --> 00:01:26,912
Wait!

5
00:01:27,887 --> 00:01:29,684
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

6
00:01:30,490 --> 00:01:32,082
Cutting it close, sir.

7
00:01:34,594 --> 00:01:36,061
Have a good flight.

8
00:02:58,378 --> 00:03:00,539
We made our expectations very clear.

9
00:03:01,247 --> 00:03:02,578
We thought you'd be happy.

10
00:03:02,649 --> 00:03:05,209
You see, our production is two months
ahead of schedule.

11
00:03:05,285 --> 00:03:07,685
Chen, we've been over this and over this.

12
00:03:08,755 --> 00:03:12,054
HouseMart operates on the basis
of just-in-time delivery.

13
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:15,023
Hell, just about every company
in America does the same.

14
00:03:15,094 --> 00:03:17,085
We get the product in,
we put it on the shelves,

15
00:03:17,163 --> 00:03:20,462
we move it out the door.
No warehousing, no excess costs.

16
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,634
But with more merchandise,
you have more to sell, happy customers.

17
00:03:24,704 --> 00:03:26,296
Let me make this really clear.

18
00:03:26,372 --> 00:03:29,398
If any more shipments arrive early,
we will refuse them.

19
00:03:29,576 --> 00:03:33,273
You want to produce all this surplus,
you pay the warehousing costs.

20
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:52,429
Tell your bosses everything will be
just as they want it.

21
00:03:52,498 --> 00:03:54,363
-They'll be glad to hear that.
-lt was a mistake is all.

22
00:03:54,434 --> 00:03:55,423
Okay.

23
00:03:57,403 --> 00:03:59,428
What kind of shifts
do you got these guys pulling, Chen?

24
00:03:59,505 --> 00:04:03,669
We are very strict, very fair.
Never more than 12 hours.

25
00:04:04,677 --> 00:04:06,042
This way please.

26
00:04:15,688 --> 00:04:19,454
Yeah, I got a three-hour layover in LA
before the Washington flight.

27
00:04:21,527 --> 00:04:24,325
No, you better tell Toby
I'm gonna miss the game.

28
00:04:25,265 --> 00:04:29,258
I'm gonna try like hell to make it though.
I hate for him to be disappointed.

29
00:04:29,335 --> 00:04:31,803
Everything went great here. Crazy though.

30
00:04:31,871 --> 00:04:35,568
Eleven meetings in three countries
in six days. Never again.

31
00:04:56,262 --> 00:04:57,251
Towel, sir?

32
00:04:58,865 --> 00:05:00,332
Excuse me. Ma'am?

33
00:05:02,035 --> 00:05:03,127
Bless you.

34
00:05:06,572 --> 00:05:07,698
Excuse me.

35
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:09,741
Your towel, please.

36
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:41,467
I thought doctors were supposed
to know better.

37
00:05:41,941 --> 00:05:43,909
I quit seven years ago.

38
00:05:44,544 --> 00:05:46,011
Promise not to tell?

39
00:05:46,412 --> 00:05:49,108
As long as you promise
to meet me in Washington next month.

40
00:05:49,182 --> 00:05:52,618
I wish I could, but God knows where I'll be.

41
00:05:53,052 --> 00:05:54,246
That's it?

42
00:05:55,188 --> 00:05:57,884
I enjoy my vices but only in moderation.

43
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:00,925
So much control.

44
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,128
It's second nature.

45
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:06,231
Why don't you stay a few days?

46
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:08,834
I'm better in small doses.

47
00:06:08,901 --> 00:06:10,493
Oh, says who?

48
00:06:10,803 --> 00:06:14,102
Everyone who's ever tried
to make it more permanent.

49
00:06:20,646 --> 00:06:23,206
I'm impressed.
Almost six hours without a page.

50
00:06:23,282 --> 00:06:24,408
I gotta go.

51
00:06:39,065 --> 00:06:40,157
Thank you.

52
00:06:40,466 --> 00:06:41,831
Hey. How are you?

53
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,194
How many confirmed?

54
00:06:43,269 --> 00:06:44,531
Only one dead.

55
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,761
Infected?

56
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:47,529
Eight as of last night.

57
00:06:47,607 --> 00:06:50,132
So there's still a chance of containment.

58
00:06:50,576 --> 00:06:54,876
We need to monitor all news services
in Asia for any potential cases.

59
00:06:55,415 --> 00:06:56,609
You have everything you need?

60
00:06:56,682 --> 00:06:59,378
Yeah, like a Boy Scout. Always prepared.

61
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:18,669
Hey, anybody here?

62
00:07:22,008 --> 00:07:23,373
Do I count?

63
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:26,073
-More than anyone.
-Hi.

64
00:07:27,547 --> 00:07:30,812
Six days ago the Chinese government
informed the WHO

65
00:07:30,883 --> 00:07:34,080
that a strain of the H5N1 virus

66
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,018
had been discovered in a marketplace

67
00:07:36,088 --> 00:07:37,817
in the Guangdong province.

68
00:07:38,024 --> 00:07:40,993
Now over 1.2 million birds were slaughtered

69
00:07:41,060 --> 00:07:43,494
in an attempt to eradicate the strain.

70
00:07:43,563 --> 00:07:45,724
But not only does it appear that they failed,

71
00:07:45,798 --> 00:07:48,961
but some of their equipment
may not have been properly sanitized

72
00:07:49,035 --> 00:07:52,732
which may have inadvertently lead
to spreading the disease.

73
00:07:52,872 --> 00:07:56,171
At least six of the victims
work at a manufacturing facility

74
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,733
where a lot of the villagers are employed.

75
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:02,244
And there is a very real possibility
that we may be looking

76
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:06,342
at the first human-to-human transmission
of the avian flu virus.

77
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:09,787
The village has been contained
though, right?

78
00:08:09,856 --> 00:08:11,983
Well, as soon as the government
was alerted.

79
00:08:12,058 --> 00:08:14,026
So we might be able to stop it?

80
00:08:14,093 --> 00:08:16,459
Only if less than 20 people are infected.

81
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:17,996
But there are only eight so far.

82
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:22,524
Look, the reality of containment
will be difficult if not impossible.

83
00:08:22,835 --> 00:08:25,099
But in this case
the global surveillance system

84
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:27,696
seems to have worked
and we caught it early.

85
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:30,540
So let's think positive thoughts, okay?

86
00:08:36,849 --> 00:08:39,613
The respiratory distress is quite severe.

87
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:41,175
Continues to worsen.

88
00:08:47,059 --> 00:08:49,391
There's a lot more than eight patients.

89
00:08:50,096 --> 00:08:52,564
Twenty-five in the last 1 2 hours.

90
00:08:52,865 --> 00:08:55,663
Which means we've lost any chance
of containment.

91
00:08:56,369 --> 00:09:00,203
I do not believe
we ever had any such chance.

92
00:09:07,213 --> 00:09:08,680
You seem surprised.

93
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:13,747
Aren't you the one who always said
it's not a matter of "if" but "when"?

94
00:09:14,520 --> 00:09:16,545
How bad do you think it'll be?

95
00:09:17,123 --> 00:09:18,715
Maybe we'll get lucky.

96
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:23,123
The pandemic could be mild like 1957 or '68.

97
00:09:23,663 --> 00:09:25,961
Those weren't mild symptoms.

98
00:09:26,599 --> 00:09:27,588
No.

99
00:09:28,167 --> 00:09:29,794
I think at this moment,

100
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:32,533
Iuck is not on our side.

101
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,903
Great hit! Run, Toby! Run! Run!

102
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:44,511
-Run, Toby!
-Go, Toby!

103
00:09:47,253 --> 00:09:48,345
Good job, son!

104
00:09:48,421 --> 00:09:50,912
-Hey, Ed, how's it going?
-Hey, good, good.

105
00:09:51,991 --> 00:09:53,481
Hey, Dan told me you got that promotion.

106
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,288
Yeah, yeah,
I took your advice and went for it.

107
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,761
That's great. They're lucky to have you.

108
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:00,122
So what did you say to him?

109
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:02,827
I told him he was being a jerk
and to grow up.

110
00:10:03,502 --> 00:10:04,560
Good.

111
00:10:05,304 --> 00:10:07,397
You know, maybe you shouldn't
hang around him so much.

112
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,441
I can handle myself, Mom.

113
00:10:09,508 --> 00:10:12,534
I'm not saying you can't,
I'm just suggesting...

114
00:10:12,845 --> 00:10:14,210
Are you okay?

115
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:17,677
Here, Dad.

116
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,980
You're coming down with something.

117
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,112
No way.

118
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:25,282
Connellys don't get sick, right?

119
00:10:26,092 --> 00:10:27,855
I think I'll turn the straw around just in case.

120
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,656
"O ye of little faith."

121
00:10:30,096 --> 00:10:32,792
Okay, Toby, it's two outs!
Run on anything! That's it!

122
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:34,332
Go, Toby!

123
00:10:34,634 --> 00:10:36,693
-That's it! Run! Slide!
-Run! Run!

124
00:10:38,938 --> 00:10:40,337
It's really unprecedented.

125
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:44,399
Forty-three governors from around the
country flew in for this emergency session.

126
00:10:44,610 --> 00:10:46,703
I'm glad they're taking it seriously.

127
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:48,076
Very seriously.

128
00:10:48,314 --> 00:10:51,909
They've been meeting with the secretary
and director of FEMA for an hour already.

129
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:53,383
We'd encourage each of you

130
00:10:53,452 --> 00:10:56,580
to update your emergency
response protocols immediately.

131
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:59,887
Make sure your comprehensive pandemic
flu planning effort integrates...

132
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:03,725
Secretary Reed, she's here.
Dr. Varnack, Secretary Reed.

133
00:11:03,796 --> 00:11:07,129
Dr. Varnack, I saw your speech
at WHO last year.

134
00:11:07,199 --> 00:11:09,133
It's nice to finally meet you in person.

135
00:11:09,201 --> 00:11:10,862
You, too, Secretary Reed.

136
00:11:10,936 --> 00:11:12,130
Call me Collin, please.

137
00:11:12,204 --> 00:11:14,365
I have a feeling
we're going to be seeing a lot of each other.

138
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,464
Yeah.

139
00:11:15,541 --> 00:11:17,736
They're a little worked up.

140
00:11:18,377 --> 00:11:20,368
Director McGarrett,
when will we have an answer?

141
00:11:20,446 --> 00:11:22,573
Some time over the next two weeks.

142
00:11:23,449 --> 00:11:24,507
All right,

143
00:11:25,685 --> 00:11:28,586
in order to answer some of your questions,

144
00:11:28,988 --> 00:11:32,719
we've invited Dr. Iris Varnack
from the Epidemic lntelligence Service

145
00:11:32,792 --> 00:11:33,918
to brief us.

146
00:11:33,993 --> 00:11:36,257
She just returned from China. Dr. Varnack...

147
00:11:36,328 --> 00:11:37,420
Thank you.

148
00:11:37,496 --> 00:11:41,728
We have been tracking the H5N1 flu virus

149
00:11:41,867 --> 00:11:43,801
since 1996.

150
00:11:44,170 --> 00:11:46,968
Now, over that time,
less than 100 people have died

151
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:50,406
and most of them
handled poultry on a daily basis.

152
00:11:50,943 --> 00:11:53,173
Two weeks ago, everything changed.

153
00:11:54,013 --> 00:11:56,345
The H5 virus mutated

154
00:11:56,415 --> 00:11:59,248
and is now transmissible
from human to human.

155
00:12:03,322 --> 00:12:05,756
So you're saying
this is the start of a pandemic?

156
00:12:05,825 --> 00:12:09,022
Come on, we can't start
throwing around the word "pandemic."

157
00:12:09,462 --> 00:12:11,191
-The public will panic.
-Well, that's what it is, isn't it?

158
00:12:11,263 --> 00:12:14,824
-Like the Spanish flu.
-The Spanish flu killed 50 million people.

159
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:18,031
-That's not what you're suggesting, right?
-No.

160
00:12:19,004 --> 00:12:22,201
Actually we believe
that it could be much worse.

161
00:12:22,975 --> 00:12:26,001
The H5 virus has a much higher fatality rate

162
00:12:26,078 --> 00:12:29,172
than the 1918 Spanish flu virus.

163
00:12:29,548 --> 00:12:33,075
We expect two to three waves
in the next year or so.

164
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:37,649
I mean, we believe
that the ultimate global loss of lives

165
00:12:37,757 --> 00:12:42,285
could reach as high as 150 or 350 million.

166
00:12:45,464 --> 00:12:47,489
And what if we close our borders?

167
00:12:47,566 --> 00:12:48,931
Now. Today.

168
00:12:49,034 --> 00:12:51,195
Shut down all the airports,
seal ourselves off.

169
00:12:51,270 --> 00:12:53,135
I'm afraid it's too late for that.

170
00:12:53,205 --> 00:12:55,264
Well, since 9/11 and hurricane Katrina

171
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,241
we've upgraded
our emergency response plans.

172
00:12:57,309 --> 00:13:00,710
This is much worse than Katrina.
This is like a hurricane Katrina

173
00:13:00,813 --> 00:13:03,008
hitting every city in every state
at the same time.

174
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:05,175
It is going to be a long and brutal ordeal

175
00:13:05,251 --> 00:13:08,084
that will rip apart the fabric of society.

176
00:13:08,220 --> 00:13:11,485
The public is gonna be demanding
a vaccine and we don't have one

177
00:13:11,557 --> 00:13:13,889
and we may not have one
for four or five months.

178
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:17,554
Well, why don't we have one
if we've known about it since 1996?

179
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:21,122
Because every single strain
of influenza is unique

180
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,259
and so you can't develop a vaccine

181
00:13:23,335 --> 00:13:26,566
until that particular strain
comes into existence.

182
00:13:26,939 --> 00:13:28,429
Rest assured though,

183
00:13:28,507 --> 00:13:31,305
every pharmaceutical company in the world

184
00:13:31,410 --> 00:13:34,140
is working around the clock
to develop a vaccine.

185
00:13:34,213 --> 00:13:35,544
It's just a very slow process.

186
00:13:35,614 --> 00:13:37,138
Well, you know what, Collin?

187
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:38,774
That's not gonna be exactly comforting

188
00:13:38,851 --> 00:13:41,445
to the people sitting at home
scared out of their minds.

189
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:44,148
They're going to be looking to us
for answers.

190
00:13:45,424 --> 00:13:46,652
Governor Newsome,

191
00:13:46,725 --> 00:13:50,593
what I can tell you is that time is our friend.

192
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:55,796
The longer the flu virus is around,
the less lethal it becomes.

193
00:13:55,868 --> 00:13:59,395
So the more time we can buy,
the more lives we can save.

194
00:13:59,738 --> 00:14:01,831
And how long before it hits here?

195
00:14:04,276 --> 00:14:07,973
We're sure that we have at least
a few weeks before it hits America.

196
00:14:12,585 --> 00:14:14,519
That's if we're lucky.

197
00:14:15,754 --> 00:14:18,154
Sixteen hundred rolls so they get $50 a roll.

198
00:14:18,257 --> 00:14:21,488
If we put them, I think it was this aisle
right here, we got them stacked down there.

199
00:14:21,560 --> 00:14:23,460
Really, all in all,
after adding the six extra aisles,

200
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:27,021
probably 16 months,
18 months to recoup all the costs on it.

201
00:14:27,366 --> 00:14:28,458
It's basically gonna be good.

202
00:14:28,534 --> 00:14:30,263
The other stores around the country
are finding the same.

203
00:14:30,336 --> 00:14:32,736
Seems like switching the placement
of the toy aisles with the hardware

204
00:14:32,805 --> 00:14:34,932
has actually worked really well.
It's a great suggestion, Ed.

205
00:14:35,007 --> 00:14:38,534
The new signage also seems
to be having a positive effect.

206
00:14:38,978 --> 00:14:39,967
Ed?

207
00:14:41,046 --> 00:14:42,638
You feeling all right?

208
00:14:43,949 --> 00:14:45,974
Ed? You all right?

209
00:14:47,820 --> 00:14:49,685
Could you get her to stop?

210
00:14:55,828 --> 00:14:57,090
Make her stop.

211
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,125
It's all right. I think they're buying the bat.

212
00:15:00,199 --> 00:15:01,632
No, it's...

213
00:15:02,868 --> 00:15:04,665
Oh, jeez man, your nose.

214
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:06,932
Here...

215
00:15:08,307 --> 00:15:10,036
Maybe you should call a doctor.

216
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:12,009
Get the hell away from me!

217
00:15:16,248 --> 00:15:18,011
Get the hell away from me!

218
00:15:25,491 --> 00:15:27,118
Somebody call 911!

219
00:15:27,860 --> 00:15:28,849
Hello!

220
00:15:30,796 --> 00:15:33,526
Dr. Daily, please report to ER seven.

221
00:15:34,099 --> 00:15:35,259
Hello?

222
00:15:36,635 --> 00:15:38,626
I want to see my husband!

223
00:15:39,138 --> 00:15:42,073
What's going on, Mom?
Why won't they let us out?

224
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,632
Oh, it must be some kind of mistake.

225
00:15:50,816 --> 00:15:53,546
Mrs. Connelly, I'm sorry to have kept you.

226
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:55,211
What the hell is going on?

227
00:15:55,287 --> 00:15:58,188
If you could just
come back this way with me please.

228
00:15:58,324 --> 00:16:00,019
I'm sorry. Alone.

229
00:16:01,760 --> 00:16:06,356
An associate of mine is gonna come
and take a few samples from you.

230
00:16:06,832 --> 00:16:08,629
What kind of samples?

231
00:16:09,368 --> 00:16:11,097
Just precautionary.

232
00:16:13,572 --> 00:16:15,096
I want to see my dad.

233
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,308
It'll be okay, guys.

234
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:27,978
I'm just going to go see him
and then I'll come back and tell you.

235
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:31,250
It'll be all right.

236
00:16:38,163 --> 00:16:39,926
He's dead, isn't he?

237
00:16:41,734 --> 00:16:44,897
In New York, representatives
to the United Nations met today

238
00:16:44,970 --> 00:16:48,133
in a rare closed door session
as fears continue to mount

239
00:16:48,207 --> 00:16:51,267
over the recent outbreak
of avian flu in China.

240
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:54,206
Speculation that the virus
has now become transmissible

241
00:16:54,279 --> 00:16:58,147
from human to human has reached
a fevered pitch around the globe.

242
00:16:58,217 --> 00:17:00,310
Kelly Firland is live from Hong Kong.

243
00:17:06,058 --> 00:17:07,650
He was fine.

244
00:17:08,093 --> 00:17:10,926
He just had a little cough, that's all.

245
00:17:11,230 --> 00:17:12,822
What's wrong with him?

246
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,695
I'm not currently at liberty to discuss this...

247
00:17:16,769 --> 00:17:18,134
He's my husband.

248
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:42,985
I need to be with him.

249
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:47,030
Of course.

250
00:17:48,934 --> 00:17:50,526
She'll take you.

251
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:11,511
I need to speak with Secretary Reed.
It's lris Varnack.

252
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,783
Well, could you please find him?

253
00:18:16,628 --> 00:18:18,687
Yes. It's an emergency.

254
00:18:35,147 --> 00:18:36,546
Secretary Reed?

255
00:18:36,615 --> 00:18:39,948
It's lris Varnack. I'm sorry to call so late.

256
00:18:40,853 --> 00:18:44,289
Yes, we've confirmed that it's the H5N1.

257
00:18:45,090 --> 00:18:47,524
The patient lives in Richmond
but he's Just returned

258
00:18:47,593 --> 00:18:49,390
from the Guangdong province.

259
00:18:50,596 --> 00:18:53,963
There's no telling how many people
he's been in contact with.

260
00:18:57,302 --> 00:19:01,170
Well, whether or not Ed Connelly
is our patient zero here in America, I mean,

261
00:19:02,407 --> 00:19:05,968
you can Just bet that he's one of many
we'll see in the next few days.

262
00:19:08,580 --> 00:19:11,515
The President wants to meet the press
and address the nation.

263
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,414
He needs to do it quickly.

264
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:17,486
The avian flu is in America.

265
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:22,887
He's coding. Let's start compression.

266
00:19:25,330 --> 00:19:26,763
Push some epi here.

267
00:19:42,481 --> 00:19:45,006
All I can tell you
is what the President said last night.

268
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:48,383
The avian flu is here.

269
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,611
We're doing everything possible to ensure...

270
00:19:50,689 --> 00:19:54,125
First we're educating medical personnel
around the country about the flu

271
00:19:54,193 --> 00:19:55,626
to ensure the highest level...

272
00:19:55,694 --> 00:19:58,458
Hospitals have detailed plans
about the isolation of infected patients...

273
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,657
Developing a vaccine is our highest priority.

274
00:20:00,732 --> 00:20:02,461
-What kind of precautions?
-Will you be closing schools?

275
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,128
What about churches and malls and
all the other places where people gather?

276
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:07,672
Look, this administration
believes that those decisions

277
00:20:07,739 --> 00:20:09,866
are best left to the respective states.

278
00:20:09,942 --> 00:20:12,103
There is still a lot of debate
about whether or not masks

279
00:20:12,177 --> 00:20:15,544
are an effective means
of keeping the virus from spreading.

280
00:20:15,614 --> 00:20:17,844
Washing your hands thoroughly,

281
00:20:18,183 --> 00:20:20,879
those are the kinds
of common-sense precautions

282
00:20:20,953 --> 00:20:23,046
everybody should be taking.

283
00:20:23,255 --> 00:20:27,658
I want to reiterate
there is absolutely no need for panic.

284
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:34,258
The pneumonia on the lungs causes the
acute respiratory distress syndrome.

285
00:20:35,667 --> 00:20:38,761
Not all patients with H5 get ARDS,

286
00:20:38,971 --> 00:20:40,563
but those that do,

287
00:20:40,772 --> 00:20:43,798
at least 40 to 60% of them will die.

288
00:20:45,010 --> 00:20:46,739
An hour prior to his death

289
00:20:46,979 --> 00:20:49,243
he complained of body aches so intense,

290
00:20:49,314 --> 00:20:51,714
he thought his bones were breaking.

291
00:20:52,517 --> 00:20:56,647
Coughed so violently
that he tore apart his abdominal muscles

292
00:20:57,256 --> 00:20:59,349
and his rib cartilage.

293
00:21:00,192 --> 00:21:02,820
Basically, he drowned in his own blood.

294
00:21:47,773 --> 00:21:50,537
Does anyone here actually have symptoms?

295
00:21:51,209 --> 00:21:52,836
This is worse than last week.

296
00:21:52,911 --> 00:21:55,675
We got more Tamiflu but only 300 doses.

297
00:21:55,947 --> 00:21:57,778
What, they're all gonna be screaming
at us again?

298
00:21:57,849 --> 00:22:00,409
There isn't any us, hon.
I'm off in 15 minutes.

299
00:22:00,485 --> 00:22:01,816
You can't just stay a little longer?

300
00:22:01,887 --> 00:22:03,718
I can't. They closed my kids' pre-school.

301
00:22:03,789 --> 00:22:06,917
I gotta pick them up before my
neighbor leaves for her night shift.

302
00:22:06,992 --> 00:22:09,552
What am I gonna tell all these people here?

303
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:12,991
You'll figure something out
or they'll eat you alive.

304
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:29,042
Hi, Judy.

305
00:22:29,114 --> 00:22:32,550
Why are so many people dying
while others seem fine?

306
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:34,746
That's an important question, Richard.

307
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,812
Not everyone who is exposed
to the virus will get sick.

308
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:41,017
Now, we think that factors like age
and genetics and your immune system

309
00:22:41,093 --> 00:22:42,219
do play a part...

310
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,660
-Hey, Sandra.
-Are you at the Connelly neighborhood?

311
00:22:44,730 --> 00:22:46,425
Yeah, I just got here.

312
00:22:46,498 --> 00:22:47,863
Is it as bad as we heard?

313
00:22:47,933 --> 00:22:49,491
It's even worse.

314
00:22:49,568 --> 00:22:52,332
I'm on my way to see
Governor Newsome now,

315
00:22:52,404 --> 00:22:55,805
provided they let me
into the fortress of solitude.

316
00:22:56,875 --> 00:22:58,342
I'll call you back.

317
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:22,155
Thanks.

318
00:23:51,196 --> 00:23:53,562
Dr. Varnack, sorry to keep you waiting.

319
00:23:54,466 --> 00:23:56,058
What can I do for you?

320
00:23:56,835 --> 00:23:58,200
Flip that switch.

321
00:23:59,771 --> 00:24:00,999
There you go.

322
00:24:02,974 --> 00:24:07,035
Governor Newsome,
it's quite a setup you've created

323
00:24:07,112 --> 00:24:08,511
for you and your staff here.

324
00:24:08,580 --> 00:24:10,514
As bio-secure as we can make it.

325
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:13,483
We even have a re-circulating
air filtration system.

326
00:24:13,652 --> 00:24:16,416
From here I have contact
with every governmental department

327
00:24:16,488 --> 00:24:18,217
in Virginia and DC.

328
00:24:18,723 --> 00:24:21,089
My job is to protect the people of this state,

329
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:23,024
and the best way I know how to do that

330
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:25,392
is to ensure continuity of leadership.

331
00:24:25,464 --> 00:24:27,489
Now is there something you needed?

332
00:24:27,566 --> 00:24:30,967
Yes. The director of the CDC
asked me to come see you.

333
00:24:31,036 --> 00:24:34,995
You've instituted quarantines
in several neighborhoods around the state.

334
00:24:35,073 --> 00:24:36,199
That's right.

335
00:24:36,274 --> 00:24:38,834
A couple of housing projects,
a military base, and the neighborhood

336
00:24:38,910 --> 00:24:40,172
where that first victim lived.

337
00:24:40,245 --> 00:24:43,544
Well, at this point, quarantines won't stop
the spread of the virus.

338
00:24:43,615 --> 00:24:44,843
It's already here.

339
00:24:44,916 --> 00:24:47,942
And it sends a terrible message
to the rest of the country.

340
00:24:48,019 --> 00:24:50,283
I think it lets the public know
we're doing something pro-active.

341
00:24:50,355 --> 00:24:51,583
It makes them feel safe.

342
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:54,420
These are gonna be extremely trying times

343
00:24:54,493 --> 00:24:56,893
and people are gonna resort
to desperate measures.

344
00:24:56,962 --> 00:25:00,227
Now, all the quarantine does is
make them feel like caged animals.

345
00:25:00,332 --> 00:25:03,392
The residents in all those areas, they're
getting food, water, medical supplies...

346
00:25:03,435 --> 00:25:05,562
You're cutting them off from their humanity

347
00:25:05,637 --> 00:25:09,334
which is the one thing that is gonna
get us through this pandemic!

348
00:25:09,774 --> 00:25:11,002
Doctor,

349
00:25:11,510 --> 00:25:15,071
maybe you've spent too much
time in Africa or Bangladesh

350
00:25:15,146 --> 00:25:16,545
or wherever.

351
00:25:17,249 --> 00:25:20,844
Maybe you're used to people
sitting back and accepting their fate.

352
00:25:20,986 --> 00:25:23,250
But that's not what we do in this country.

353
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:26,688
What we do is fight
with every weapon in our arsenal.

354
00:25:26,758 --> 00:25:29,693
Now, if that means we have to make
some tough choices, then so be it.

355
00:25:29,761 --> 00:25:32,252
I was elected to make those tough choices.

356
00:25:32,564 --> 00:25:35,158
We have to take care of each other.

357
00:25:35,333 --> 00:25:39,429
I couldn't agree with you more.
That's exactly what I'm doing!

358
00:25:42,007 --> 00:25:44,134
I assume you can see yourself out.

359
00:26:05,797 --> 00:26:06,923
There you go.

360
00:26:06,998 --> 00:26:08,090
Thank you.

361
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:13,161
Steve Stuart.

362
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:18,702
Three days.

363
00:26:25,784 --> 00:26:26,773
Address?

364
00:26:26,851 --> 00:26:28,375
602 Oleander.

365
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:33,747
There you go.
These'll last you for three days.

366
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,292
When are they gonna let us out of here?

367
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:37,294
I don't have that information.

368
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:41,588
My mom wanted me to get
some more gloves and masks.

369
00:26:41,666 --> 00:26:42,655
That's impossible.

370
00:26:42,734 --> 00:26:44,099
They're all made in China

371
00:26:44,169 --> 00:26:46,865
and there's nothing coming
from over there right now.

372
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:05,480
Lauren?

373
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:07,314
Hi, Mrs. Koppel.

374
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,218
How are you all doing?

375
00:27:09,761 --> 00:27:11,558
As well as we can, I guess.

376
00:27:11,696 --> 00:27:13,789
We were all cleared of the virus.

377
00:27:14,032 --> 00:27:15,329
Thank the Lord.

378
00:27:15,934 --> 00:27:18,198
I've been saying prayers for you.

379
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:20,202
We all have.

380
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:40,486
Tensions escalated as the
New York City Mayor's proposed

381
00:27:40,558 --> 00:27:44,289
electricity rationing met with
stiff resistance from the city council.

382
00:27:44,362 --> 00:27:46,887
And on Wall Street today
transportation stocks

383
00:27:46,965 --> 00:27:50,059
continue their tumble
for the 18th straight day.

384
00:27:50,135 --> 00:27:52,933
Congressional debate over closure of the
financial market...

385
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:56,939
Your husband is doing well, I hope?

386
00:27:57,776 --> 00:27:59,641
I wish I knew. He's still in lraq.

387
00:27:59,711 --> 00:28:02,509
He hasn't answered his e-mail
in a couple of days.

388
00:28:02,580 --> 00:28:05,413
My husband Albert, he was a soldier, too.

389
00:28:05,483 --> 00:28:08,418
Many months would go by
and I would hear not a word.

390
00:28:08,486 --> 00:28:10,420
I don't know how you stood it.

391
00:28:10,922 --> 00:28:12,890
No one gave me the choice.

392
00:28:14,459 --> 00:28:17,053
$19? For coffee?

393
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:22,695
Nobody has fresh coffee anywhere else
around here. You can't get it.

394
00:28:24,302 --> 00:28:26,896
For you, $17.

395
00:28:48,426 --> 00:28:51,327
I've called the police. The baby's in there.

396
00:28:51,529 --> 00:28:54,327
Devon? What's going on? Where's Tracy?

397
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,833
They're all sick. I was afraid to go in.

398
00:29:08,546 --> 00:29:09,911
I couldn't...

399
00:29:11,182 --> 00:29:14,345
Scott what are you doing?
Come on, don't do this...

400
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:17,283
I couldn't save her.

401
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:20,822
Nobody could.

402
00:29:21,192 --> 00:29:24,059
Okay, well, we'll get you some help, okay?

403
00:29:25,764 --> 00:29:27,288
We're all gonna die.

404
00:29:27,365 --> 00:29:29,026
Oh, God!

405
00:29:36,107 --> 00:29:37,233
Jesus.

406
00:29:46,317 --> 00:29:50,117
It's been three weeks now
since the first victim of avian flu died.

407
00:29:50,221 --> 00:29:53,486
But citizens here in Moscow
are less concerned with health risks

408
00:29:53,558 --> 00:29:57,858
than with Russian president Alexandrov's
recent ban on all public gatherings.

409
00:29:57,929 --> 00:30:00,295
Crowds poured into Red Square today
in protest

410
00:30:00,365 --> 00:30:02,833
and were met with resistance
from the state police.

411
00:30:02,901 --> 00:30:04,596
So tell me what's happening.

412
00:30:04,669 --> 00:30:06,500
It's like the Wild West out here.

413
00:30:06,571 --> 00:30:09,438
Criminal gangs hitting delivery
trucks, warehouses.

414
00:30:09,507 --> 00:30:11,805
There's a huge black market opening up.

415
00:30:11,876 --> 00:30:13,070
Are you guys having any problems

416
00:30:13,144 --> 00:30:15,442
with local law enforcement
walking off the job?

417
00:30:15,513 --> 00:30:17,538
Yeah, we've lost 25% of our force.

418
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:20,049
How many inmates is he talking about
putting on the streets?

419
00:30:20,118 --> 00:30:21,449
As many as possible.

420
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,783
Evidently, it's really bad inside the prison.

421
00:30:23,855 --> 00:30:26,949
They've got no way
to treat or isolate all the sick.

422
00:30:28,359 --> 00:30:32,386
Well, we can't just release
convicted felons into the population.

423
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:34,658
-You want to do this another time?
-Yeah.

424
00:30:34,732 --> 00:30:39,066
We have to demand that they send back
our National Guard units immediately.

425
00:30:39,137 --> 00:30:42,629
Now, when I make this call,
can I count on you two to support me?

426
00:30:42,707 --> 00:30:44,004
-Absolutely.
-Yes, of course.

427
00:30:44,075 --> 00:30:45,303
Okay, thanks.

428
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,000
I'll call you later.

429
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:49,043
-Mike.
-Yeah?

430
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:51,478
We just got word from the White House.

431
00:30:51,916 --> 00:30:56,182
They're not releasing any of the strategic
national stockpile of Tamiflu to us.

432
00:30:56,754 --> 00:30:58,221
Why the hell not?

433
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:00,018
New York and California
are declaring priority

434
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,855
because of the number of infected.

435
00:31:01,926 --> 00:31:05,191
Plus the Pentagon's saying
it needs more for the military.

436
00:31:06,097 --> 00:31:08,065
That's part of our emergency protocol.

437
00:31:08,132 --> 00:31:09,463
I don't know how much it matters.

438
00:31:09,534 --> 00:31:12,970
Everything I'm hearing is that
the anti-virals aren't working anyway.

439
00:31:13,037 --> 00:31:16,529
That is not the point.
We were told we could count on it!

440
00:31:16,608 --> 00:31:20,066
What's the use of having a plan
if nobody wants to follow it?

441
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:30,353
Finally. Two faces I actually want to see.

442
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:34,857
Your father called.

443
00:31:34,926 --> 00:31:37,053
He and your mom are up at the cabin
like you suggested.

444
00:31:37,128 --> 00:31:39,926
-Good. Did they take lots of food?
-Yeah.

445
00:31:39,998 --> 00:31:42,398
You really think it's gonna get that bad?

446
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:44,933
Might as well be prepared for the worst.

447
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:49,570
Bored out of your mind yet?

448
00:31:49,641 --> 00:31:52,906
I never thought I'd say it,
but I'm sick of my PlayStation.

449
00:32:01,085 --> 00:32:03,553
How long are we going to be here, anyway?

450
00:32:04,322 --> 00:32:07,120
We're going to be out of here
before you know it.

451
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:09,758
Every vaccine manufacturer in the world

452
00:32:09,827 --> 00:32:11,954
is working on
developing something to stop this.

453
00:32:12,030 --> 00:32:15,056
I just never thought the flu
would be such a big deal.

454
00:32:15,433 --> 00:32:17,424
How long do you think it'll be?

455
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:19,228
Soon.

456
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:22,338
We're going to be out of here real soon.

457
00:32:32,784 --> 00:32:34,251
This is ridiculous.

458
00:32:37,755 --> 00:32:40,019
All we have left is rice and flour.

459
00:32:40,858 --> 00:32:41,847
All right.

460
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:43,325
No, it's not all right.

461
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,419
You have to go down
to those idiots at the barricades

462
00:32:45,496 --> 00:32:47,521
and tell them we need real food.

463
00:32:48,466 --> 00:32:49,626
Okay, honey.

464
00:32:52,770 --> 00:32:53,862
Mom...

465
00:32:58,343 --> 00:32:59,332
Mom!

466
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:01,404
What is it?

467
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,011
Toby. He's sick!

468
00:33:03,548 --> 00:33:06,711
No. No, he can't be.

469
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:08,115
He can't be.

470
00:33:09,420 --> 00:33:11,411
We were fine. We were all fine.

471
00:33:11,556 --> 00:33:14,320
Oh, my God. Oh, sweetie.

472
00:33:14,959 --> 00:33:16,153
Oh, my God.

473
00:33:32,810 --> 00:33:36,541
I can't have my baby here!
I shouldn't even be in here!

474
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:39,447
Do you know how dangerous this is for me?
For my baby?

475
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,007
Excuse me.
We gotta get some help over here.

476
00:33:41,085 --> 00:33:42,484
Somebody will be right with you, sir.

477
00:33:42,553 --> 00:33:44,350
Just, my mama needs something.

478
00:33:44,422 --> 00:33:45,719
You gotta give her something for the pain.

479
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,054
If you just sit with her,
we'll get you some help.

480
00:33:48,126 --> 00:33:51,152
We've been waiting a real long time, okay?

481
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:52,890
She's hurting bad.

482
00:33:53,398 --> 00:33:57,357
Okay, just... I'm going to find you
something, okay? Just sit tight.

483
00:34:00,271 --> 00:34:01,966
They just closed the 8th and 9th floors.

484
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:03,064
They're full?

485
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:05,166
The whole damn hospital's full.

486
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:07,709
The hallways, the cafeteria. Everywhere.

487
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:09,744
What is that?

488
00:34:09,814 --> 00:34:11,509
I'm not staying here.

489
00:34:11,582 --> 00:34:15,313
Tell me, what is that?
Are you taking the supplies?

490
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:18,480
My mom and my little boy are sick at home

491
00:34:18,556 --> 00:34:20,524
and it was probably me
that got them that way.

492
00:34:20,591 --> 00:34:25,392
I'm not doing this anymore, and don't
you dare make me feel guilty about it!

493
00:34:31,469 --> 00:34:32,800
Alma?

494
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:35,097
Alma?

495
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:36,664
Alma?

496
00:34:37,041 --> 00:34:38,303
-Alma!
-Curtis?

497
00:34:39,143 --> 00:34:40,974
-Curtis? Curtis!
-Alma.

498
00:34:41,512 --> 00:34:42,501
Curtis!

499
00:34:44,082 --> 00:34:45,777
Curtis, you're home!

500
00:34:49,287 --> 00:34:52,051
They brought us back.
The whole damn National Guard,

501
00:34:52,123 --> 00:34:53,215
they brought us back.

502
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:54,781
Look at you. You're so thin.

503
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:57,555
I was sick a couple of weeks.
I didn't want to worry you.

504
00:34:57,628 --> 00:34:58,822
With the flu?

505
00:34:58,896 --> 00:35:01,194
I'm okay, look at me. I'm better now.

506
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,460
You were sick and you didn't tell me?

507
00:35:03,534 --> 00:35:05,502
Sweetie, you have enough to worry about.

508
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,595
I know, but you should've told me.

509
00:35:07,672 --> 00:35:09,469
Everything's gonna be fine.

510
00:35:10,241 --> 00:35:12,539
It's okay, everything's gonna be fine.

511
00:35:13,411 --> 00:35:15,208
Everything's gonna be fine.

512
00:35:23,187 --> 00:35:24,882
Dr. Varnack,

513
00:35:24,956 --> 00:35:28,619
I hope your efforts there
are proving more successful than our own.

514
00:35:29,026 --> 00:35:30,994
These are dark times indeed.

515
00:35:32,296 --> 00:35:35,231
The reason for my writing is to let you know

516
00:35:35,299 --> 00:35:37,790
that our common foe has mutated yet again.

517
00:35:38,369 --> 00:35:41,463
The H5 has become resistant to anti-virals

518
00:35:41,539 --> 00:35:45,031
which means we have no more
weapons left with which to fight.

519
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:51,710
The government is keeping it quiet,
but we are in terrible trouble.

520
00:35:52,917 --> 00:35:55,818
What you have witnessed so far
has been bad, I know.

521
00:35:56,554 --> 00:36:00,991
But America and the rest of the world
must prepare for worse.

522
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,350
Much, much worse.

523
00:36:54,111 --> 00:36:55,339
I missed you.

524
00:36:56,214 --> 00:36:58,944
I can't believe you were sick
and I didn't know.

525
00:37:01,352 --> 00:37:02,751
I know, it just...

526
00:37:04,188 --> 00:37:08,784
It hit me and I literally started having
these hallucinations and...

527
00:37:10,695 --> 00:37:12,128
I was out. I just

528
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:14,426
dropped down right there.

529
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:17,058
A couple guys actually
thought I'd been shot.

530
00:37:19,370 --> 00:37:22,601
I'm better now. Mostly better anyway.

531
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:26,301
It takes some people months,
even years for their body to fully recover.

532
00:37:26,377 --> 00:37:30,575
No, not me, baby. I'm invincible.

533
00:37:31,282 --> 00:37:32,977
Girl, I'm like superman.

534
00:37:34,885 --> 00:37:37,183
You've only got resistance
to this particular strain.

535
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,950
If it mutates, you're...

536
00:37:39,323 --> 00:37:42,622
Just let me enjoy my little power
for a while, okay?

537
00:37:44,095 --> 00:37:45,187
Okay.

538
00:37:48,399 --> 00:37:51,368
So what exactly are you and the Guard
gonna be doing?

539
00:37:54,138 --> 00:37:55,799
Just keeping order.

540
00:37:55,873 --> 00:37:57,204
Just helping out.

541
00:37:58,509 --> 00:38:01,569
Whatever the police or fire department need.
Whoever needs us.

542
00:38:01,646 --> 00:38:03,944
Well, I need you more than any of them.

543
00:38:04,815 --> 00:38:05,941
And I need you.

544
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:07,143
I need you.

545
00:38:10,955 --> 00:38:13,219
I need you but I'm gonna be late.

546
00:38:13,291 --> 00:38:15,418
I have to go. I'm late!

547
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,460
-Don't go!
-Are you kidding me?

548
00:38:20,531 --> 00:38:23,159
My overtime's gonna get us
a bigger apartment.

549
00:38:29,507 --> 00:38:33,739
We're all facing dire shortages of
everything from food to aspirin to soap

550
00:38:33,811 --> 00:38:37,178
as warehouses around the globe
continue to empty out.

551
00:38:37,481 --> 00:38:41,611
Though the worldwide death toll
has now passed 350, 000,

552
00:38:41,952 --> 00:38:46,821
experts warn that we will see these numbers
double or even triple very quickly.

553
00:38:47,158 --> 00:38:48,250
Now it's time to go to...

554
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:51,591
There weren't any more coffee beans
anywhere but there's instant if you want...

555
00:38:51,662 --> 00:38:53,926
Six of the largest national
insurance companies

556
00:38:53,998 --> 00:38:57,593
all filed for bankruptcy protection
in federal courts today.

557
00:38:57,668 --> 00:39:01,069
Attorneys contend that it would take
several billion dollars to pay off

558
00:39:01,138 --> 00:39:02,230
Iife insurance policies for those already...

559
00:39:02,306 --> 00:39:03,864
Did you hear me?

560
00:39:05,676 --> 00:39:07,906
-Alma, don't go.
-What?

561
00:39:09,547 --> 00:39:12,778
Don't go. Just call them and quit.
Something.

562
00:39:12,850 --> 00:39:14,579
Just don't go back.

563
00:39:14,752 --> 00:39:18,188
I can't do that.
We don't have enough people as it is.

564
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:21,721
Every day you work there is like...

565
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:26,058
Like you're going down a street
full of land mines.

566
00:39:26,897 --> 00:39:28,660
I'm careful, Curtis.

567
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:34,970
Can't get away from this, you know?
Can't get away for two minutes.

568
00:39:35,072 --> 00:39:38,200
What's the point of running
when there's nowhere to run?

569
00:39:57,128 --> 00:39:58,686
Tensions are at a breaking point

570
00:39:58,763 --> 00:40:02,221
with both the NAACP and the ACLU
sharply condemning

571
00:40:02,299 --> 00:40:04,859
Governor Mike Newsome's
continued quarantine

572
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:07,597
of several housing proJects
around the state.

573
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:10,772
Family and friends
of those under quarantine

574
00:40:10,841 --> 00:40:13,639
have been converging on the Governor's
emergency headquarters

575
00:40:13,711 --> 00:40:15,440
in growing numbers.

576
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:18,907
Calling the quarantined neighborhoods
death traps,

577
00:40:18,983 --> 00:40:22,316
they are demanding the release
of their loved ones immediately.

578
00:40:22,386 --> 00:40:24,513
The scene is much the same
across the nation

579
00:40:24,588 --> 00:40:28,388
with critics insisting that current strategies
are clearly not working.

580
00:40:28,459 --> 00:40:30,324
Like the protestors gathered here,

581
00:40:30,394 --> 00:40:33,727
these critics believe
that political leaders and emergency...

582
00:40:56,387 --> 00:40:57,979
Mike?
