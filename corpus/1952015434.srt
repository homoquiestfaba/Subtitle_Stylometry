1
00:02:21,350 --> 00:02:23,436
- Donald?

2
00:02:26,397 --> 00:02:28,065
- Catherine...

3
00:02:29,900 --> 00:02:32,319
...this just isn't working out, right?

4
00:04:31,355 --> 00:04:33,482
....sculpture or..

5
00:04:33,858 --> 00:04:36,277
...computer generated graphics.

6
00:04:37,361 --> 00:04:39,739
It doesn't matter what style
you chose to work in.

7
00:04:39,822 --> 00:04:41,032
Whether it's primitivism, -

8
00:04:41,198 --> 00:04:44,535
- ...romantic realism,
postmodern deconstructivism.

9
00:04:44,869 --> 00:04:46,829
The same rules apply.

10
00:04:47,121 --> 00:04:49,040
Everything is governed by
the laws of nature.

11
00:04:49,915 --> 00:04:51,500
Nowhere is this principle -

12
00:04:51,667 --> 00:04:54,795
- more perfectly manifested
than in the human form.

13
00:04:56,339 --> 00:04:57,506
- Excuse me.

14
00:04:57,590 --> 00:04:59,800
Ehm, is this the, eh...

15
00:04:59,925 --> 00:05:01,010
- Light study?

16
00:05:02,219 --> 00:05:04,347
Wait a minute, don't tell me,
let me guess.

17
00:05:05,890 --> 00:05:07,350
Lily Leonetti.

18
00:05:08,893 --> 00:05:10,519
Two weeks and 30 minutes late.

19
00:05:10,853 --> 00:05:13,439
Sorry. Family emergency.

20
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,149
- It's alright, come on in.

21
00:05:16,275 --> 00:05:18,235
Let's get you setup over here.

22
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:20,029
I don't think Catherine's coming back.

23
00:05:21,447 --> 00:05:23,449
Alright, let's stay focused, folks.

24
00:05:24,575 --> 00:05:27,828
We were talking about
learning the rules -

25
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:29,538
- before you break them.

26
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,001
Specifically, perspective
and proportion -

27
00:05:34,168 --> 00:05:35,836
- as it relates to
the human body.

28
00:05:37,129 --> 00:05:38,506
Which brings us back to Isabel.

29
00:05:42,301 --> 00:05:44,261
So, see if you can discover
the hidden truths -

30
00:05:44,428 --> 00:05:47,723
- of shadows and the light.

31
00:05:47,848 --> 00:05:51,185
Translate what you see through
your arms and finger tips -

32
00:05:51,268 --> 00:05:52,520
- on to the page.

33
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,081
- Is this 508 Alta?

34
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:03,341
- I'm Gredin.

35
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:05,760
- Lily.

36
00:07:06,886 --> 00:07:07,970
- I know.

37
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:11,390
- Thank you.

38
00:07:17,229 --> 00:07:18,189
- Follow me.

39
00:07:23,527 --> 00:07:25,279
The entrance is in the back.

40
00:08:23,421 --> 00:08:26,090
- I'm Lily, the new room mate.

41
00:08:27,258 --> 00:08:29,093
- Oh, you're here.

42
00:08:31,178 --> 00:08:32,430
I'm Tanya, by the way.

43
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:38,185
- Anything in this cupboard is mine.

44
00:08:38,269 --> 00:08:39,270
And the living room is off limits -

45
00:08:41,063 --> 00:08:42,356
And the living room is off limits
because that's where I practice.

46
00:08:45,276 --> 00:08:47,820
Bridgette, Lily.

47
00:08:47,945 --> 00:08:49,488
- English major, right?

48
00:08:51,866 --> 00:08:53,075
- No, art.

49
00:08:53,159 --> 00:08:54,160
Painting.

50
00:08:54,243 --> 00:08:55,703
- That's funny, I would never have guessed.

51
00:08:57,329 --> 00:08:59,457
- Well, I can see we're off to a good start.

52
00:09:01,375 --> 00:09:02,418
Hai.

53
00:09:32,448 --> 00:09:33,741
- Is she always like that?

54
00:09:33,866 --> 00:09:35,743
- Unfortunately yes.

55
00:09:35,868 --> 00:09:37,912
- What about that guy, Gredin?

56
00:09:38,037 --> 00:09:41,332
- Gredin is really cool
and an amazing sculptor.

57
00:09:41,499 --> 00:09:43,250
And that's Robert.

58
00:09:43,376 --> 00:09:45,127
A major talent.

59
00:09:51,425 --> 00:09:53,302
Well, here we are.

60
00:09:56,305 --> 00:09:58,140
It's not exactly the Beal Air.

61
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:03,229
In fact it's not even The Ramada.

62
00:10:03,312 --> 00:10:04,271
- It's nice.

63
00:10:06,148 --> 00:10:07,149
- Where did you say you were from again?

64
00:10:08,567 --> 00:10:09,819
- Michigan.

65
00:10:11,278 --> 00:10:12,780
- First time to L.A.?

66
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:14,240
- First time anywhere, really!

67
00:10:16,242 --> 00:10:18,369
- Well, the world of bytes is calling.

68
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:19,412
I gotta run.

69
00:12:30,209 --> 00:12:31,502
- How's L.A., kiddo?

70
00:12:31,919 --> 00:12:34,422
- Hi dad, it's good.

71
00:12:34,588 --> 00:12:35,840
It's nice.

72
00:12:35,923 --> 00:12:38,801
- Well, this place feels
pretty empty without you.

73
00:12:39,176 --> 00:12:40,803
Hold on, your mum wants to talk to you.

74
00:12:40,970 --> 00:12:42,096
- OK.

75
00:12:43,347 --> 00:12:45,057
Hi mum.

76
00:12:45,141 --> 00:12:46,809
- Did you like your surprise?

77
00:12:49,020 --> 00:12:50,187
- Hold on a sec.

78
00:12:58,946 --> 00:12:59,989
What is it?

79
00:13:01,365 --> 00:13:03,451
- It's just a little something
to remind you of us.

80
00:13:07,413 --> 00:13:09,457
You know, I don't know why you
had to go all the way to L.A. -

81
00:13:09,498 --> 00:13:12,209
- to be an artist.

82
00:13:12,376 --> 00:13:14,837
We could have bought you
a car if you wanted to stay.

83
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:17,381
Mary Jane you know,
Catherine's daughter -

84
00:13:17,548 --> 00:13:19,508
- she went to state and she's very happy -

85
00:13:19,675 --> 00:13:21,969
- making all sorts of arts and crafts.

86
00:13:23,137 --> 00:13:25,806
- Mum, do we have to have
this conversation again?

87
00:13:27,558 --> 00:13:28,809
Where's daddy?

88
00:13:29,518 --> 00:13:30,770
- Bob!

89
00:13:31,896 --> 00:13:33,481
Oh, he's gone off somewhere.

90
00:13:33,606 --> 00:13:35,566
- I gotta go.

91
00:13:35,900 --> 00:13:37,318
- Go? We just got on?

92
00:13:38,319 --> 00:13:40,529
- Mum, I'm gonna be late for class?

93
00:13:41,655 --> 00:13:44,825
- OK, will we see you at Thanksgiving?

94
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:47,453
- I don't know yet, mum.
I haven't looked up my schedule.

95
00:13:50,539 --> 00:13:51,499
I try, OK?

96
00:13:51,916 --> 00:13:53,876
- Fine, don't forget to call me!

97
00:17:23,836 --> 00:17:26,422
- That's Peter, performance artist.

98
00:17:26,589 --> 00:17:27,757
Or as he likes to refer to it:

99
00:17:28,049 --> 00:17:30,092
"Self as show".

100
00:17:30,259 --> 00:17:31,260
Some day with any luck -

101
00:17:31,427 --> 00:17:33,220
- somebody will put him
out of his misery.

102
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:20,810
- Look at her, Lily.

103
00:18:21,811 --> 00:18:22,978
What do you see?

104
00:18:24,855 --> 00:18:26,732
- I see...

105
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,025
... a face.

106
00:18:29,527 --> 00:18:31,070
And a body.

107
00:18:31,195 --> 00:18:32,238
- And what else?

108
00:18:34,907 --> 00:18:37,118
- I see a naked woman.

109
00:18:37,159 --> 00:18:38,327
- Right.

110
00:18:38,369 --> 00:18:41,122
The whole naked woman, not just parts.

111
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,000
Not just the head.

112
00:18:47,128 --> 00:18:49,130
Soft skin.

113
00:18:49,296 --> 00:18:51,048
Cloaked breast.

114
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:54,010
And a waist.

115
00:18:55,386 --> 00:18:56,762
Legs, the whole thing.

116
00:18:56,887 --> 00:18:58,305
Get it all on the page.

117
00:18:59,348 --> 00:19:01,517
Keep going over again and
again and eventually -

118
00:19:01,851 --> 00:19:03,769
- Technic will give way for expression.

119
00:19:06,897 --> 00:19:07,982
- Thank you.

120
00:19:08,107 --> 00:19:10,401
Or expression -

121
00:19:11,527 --> 00:19:14,196
- will give way to expression.

122
00:19:16,907 --> 00:19:18,367
- You have some thoughts
you'd like to share with us?

123
00:19:18,451 --> 00:19:20,077
- Me?

124
00:19:20,161 --> 00:19:22,997
Thought? Share?

125
00:19:24,540 --> 00:19:27,126
No, I couldn't possibly.

126
00:19:27,209 --> 00:19:29,378
I'm here to listen and learn.

127
00:19:30,838 --> 00:19:32,089
Copy and conform.

128
00:19:32,256 --> 00:19:34,008
- From the masterpiece you just created, -

129
00:19:34,050 --> 00:19:36,218
- it's obvious you have transcended -

130
00:19:36,385 --> 00:19:37,970
- all need for traditional form.

131
00:19:41,390 --> 00:19:44,769
- This, my fellow students was created -

132
00:19:44,935 --> 00:19:46,479
- out of no other tradition -

133
00:19:47,563 --> 00:19:49,106
- without form.

134
00:19:55,279 --> 00:19:56,238
This -

135
00:19:57,490 --> 00:19:58,991
- this is an A plus.

136
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:02,787
This is a perfect example -

137
00:20:02,828 --> 00:20:05,247
of a 100 percent surrender -

138
00:20:05,289 --> 00:20:08,167
- to the process of tradition.

139
00:20:08,250 --> 00:20:09,460
It is so lifelike -

140
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:12,296
- you can almost fuck it.

141
00:20:20,429 --> 00:20:21,430
- You through?

142
00:20:23,099 --> 00:20:24,392
Will you get back to work?

143
00:20:36,487 --> 00:20:37,780
- Jack ass.

144
00:20:50,501 --> 00:20:51,460
- You OK?

145
00:21:12,440 --> 00:21:13,399
- Can I come in?

146
00:21:14,859 --> 00:21:16,819
- No, I'm not dressed.

147
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:20,322
- I'm sorry about earlier.

148
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:22,033
It had nothing to do with you.

149
00:21:46,849 --> 00:21:48,309
January 28th.

150
00:21:48,351 --> 00:21:50,728
It's late and I'm wide awake.

151
00:21:50,811 --> 00:21:52,980
Burning up, bored.

152
00:21:53,105 --> 00:21:54,440
Feel like dancing.

153
00:21:54,565 --> 00:21:56,067
Having some fun.

154
00:21:57,193 --> 00:21:58,778
Like turning someone over.

155
00:22:00,237 --> 00:22:02,740
Tease, taunt...

156
00:22:02,865 --> 00:22:04,992
... twist him around my little finger.

157
00:22:07,370 --> 00:22:10,289
Taking him to places he
never knew he wanted to go.

158
00:22:11,540 --> 00:22:13,501
Bad places.

159
00:22:13,876 --> 00:22:15,419
Dark places.

160
00:22:15,503 --> 00:22:16,837
Great places.

161
00:22:22,259 --> 00:22:25,096
February 1st. Selfportraits.

162
00:22:26,597 --> 00:22:28,808
To expose it all.

163
00:22:28,891 --> 00:22:30,810
To see myself the way a lover would.

164
00:22:32,269 --> 00:22:34,271
No shame, no fear.

165
00:22:35,439 --> 00:22:36,982
Not a fear in the world.

166
00:22:41,278 --> 00:22:44,407
Nothing hidden, no secrets.

167
00:23:42,840 --> 00:23:44,133
- Nothing hidden...

168
00:23:45,843 --> 00:23:47,470
... no secrets.

169
00:24:06,947 --> 00:24:08,866
With you I'm so foolish it hurts.

170
00:24:08,949 --> 00:24:10,242
The mouth wants to speak -

171
00:24:10,368 --> 00:24:12,411
- but only knows the wrong thing to say.

172
00:24:13,621 --> 00:24:15,539
Without you there is no flower -

173
00:24:15,623 --> 00:24:18,292
- and nothing good grows
in the garden of my heart

174
00:24:29,595 --> 00:24:32,139
- I understand you are looking
for a babysitting job?

175
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:37,770
- Bridgette! Shut that shit off!

176
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:45,111
I'm gonna kill her.

177
00:24:45,277 --> 00:24:47,530
You wanna help? Good!

178
00:24:47,613 --> 00:24:49,323
I was thinking fat pills.

179
00:24:49,490 --> 00:24:51,742
She's always saying if
she gains one more pound -

180
00:24:51,909 --> 00:24:53,160
- she's gonna kill herself.

181
00:24:53,285 --> 00:24:54,537
- Suicide? Very good.

182
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:56,789
- Thank you.

183
00:24:59,208 --> 00:25:00,126
- I got a job!

184
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:01,210
- Doing what?

185
00:25:01,377 --> 00:25:02,336
- Babysitting.

186
00:25:03,379 --> 00:25:06,340
- How totally sweet!

187
00:25:06,507 --> 00:25:08,009
...

188
00:25:10,428 --> 00:25:11,470
- She hates me.

189
00:25:12,888 --> 00:25:14,306
I'm a little sensitive now.

190
00:25:15,599 --> 00:25:17,309
- You two know each other?

191
00:25:18,978 --> 00:25:21,230
- We do but she might
not wanna know me now.

192
00:25:23,399 --> 00:25:25,109
Tell her I'm not half bad, Tanya.

193
00:25:27,403 --> 00:25:30,156
- I wish I was half as
good as you, Gredin.

194
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:35,077
Come on, I'll make it up to you.

195
00:25:36,412 --> 00:25:39,040
- Nothing ventured,
nothing gained, right?

196
00:25:57,600 --> 00:25:59,310
- I got carried away with Donald -

197
00:25:59,477 --> 00:26:01,062
- I shouldn't have put
you in the middle of it.

198
00:26:01,937 --> 00:26:04,732
- No, I probably overreacted.

199
00:26:04,899 --> 00:26:08,069
I can sometimes be hypersensitive.

200
00:26:08,235 --> 00:26:10,321
- You shouldn't be, you got it.

201
00:26:14,158 --> 00:26:16,285
- The only person in class -

202
00:26:16,369 --> 00:26:19,789
- whose hand the teacher has to hold.

203
00:26:21,916 --> 00:26:25,419
- Well, Falk has a thing for
his female undergraduates.

204
00:26:25,461 --> 00:26:27,296
Especially when they look like you.

205
00:26:29,590 --> 00:26:30,800
- What is this?

206
00:26:32,176 --> 00:26:34,261
- This is my magical craft.

207
00:26:34,428 --> 00:26:36,972
I'm sort of hoping it
will win me at Guggenheim.

208
00:26:38,516 --> 00:26:39,517
- You'll get it.

209
00:26:41,185 --> 00:26:43,062
- You psychic?

210
00:26:43,187 --> 00:26:45,272
- No. You deserve it.

211
00:26:48,359 --> 00:26:50,486
- So where were you
the first two weeks?

212
00:26:52,446 --> 00:26:53,447
- Well...

213
00:26:55,241 --> 00:26:56,409
... when I applied -

214
00:26:56,492 --> 00:26:58,828
- I never thought I'd get accepted.

215
00:26:59,870 --> 00:27:03,791
And I was...
I just freaked.

216
00:27:05,251 --> 00:27:06,961
No big family emergency.

217
00:27:08,295 --> 00:27:09,797
Just my little private one.

218
00:27:11,882 --> 00:27:13,050
That's all.

219
00:27:14,343 --> 00:27:15,761
- That's enough.

220
00:27:17,388 --> 00:27:19,515
You see that hill over there?

221
00:27:22,101 --> 00:27:24,228
That's Beverly Hills.
That's my home.

222
00:27:25,438 --> 00:27:27,148
Might as well be Timbuktu.

223
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:31,152
My father and I we don't talk any more.

224
00:27:44,498 --> 00:27:45,499
What are you thinking?

225
00:27:47,418 --> 00:27:48,419
- Making a wish.

226
00:27:52,089 --> 00:27:53,049
- What do you wish?

227
00:27:55,259 --> 00:27:56,802
- That I could just...

228
00:27:58,429 --> 00:28:00,806
... open my eyes and be different.

229
00:28:02,892 --> 00:28:04,268
Silly of me.

230
00:28:05,936 --> 00:28:07,438
- Hey, listen.

231
00:28:14,362 --> 00:28:16,113
...

232
00:28:18,949 --> 00:28:20,076
You're beautiful.

233
00:28:22,078 --> 00:28:23,037
- No, I'm not.

234
00:28:24,497 --> 00:28:25,498
- Yes, you are.

235
00:28:27,083 --> 00:28:28,125
You're sweet.

236
00:28:29,418 --> 00:28:30,419
You're beautiful.

237
00:28:33,047 --> 00:28:34,090
And different.

238
00:29:03,577 --> 00:29:04,787
March 1st.

239
00:29:06,497 --> 00:29:08,249
How do you know what you can do -

240
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:09,417
- until you do it?

241
00:29:11,043 --> 00:29:13,129
How do you know who you can have -

242
00:29:13,212 --> 00:29:14,296
until you've had them?

243
00:29:16,090 --> 00:29:18,509
I didn't know him from Adam.

244
00:29:18,843 --> 00:29:21,178
But I knew exactly what he needed.

245
00:29:22,471 --> 00:29:24,098
What he needed was me.

246
00:29:25,558 --> 00:29:27,018
A dark club.

247
00:29:27,101 --> 00:29:29,020
Loud music.

248
00:29:29,186 --> 00:29:30,438
A corner to ourselves.

249
00:29:32,023 --> 00:29:34,150
Anonymous. Shameless.

250
00:29:35,317 --> 00:29:38,195
No past. No future.

251
00:30:47,181 --> 00:30:59,694
Valeria Andrews: What's Come Over Me

252
00:32:07,219 --> 00:32:08,220
Tease.

253
00:32:09,347 --> 00:32:10,348
Taunt.

254
00:32:11,891 --> 00:32:14,393
Twist him around my little finger.

255
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:19,482
No shame. No fear.

256
00:32:19,857 --> 00:32:21,400
Without a fear in the world.

257
00:32:48,177 --> 00:32:50,012
- Looking good.

258
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:53,265
- That guy's a loser.

259
00:32:55,309 --> 00:32:59,271
Besides, I have a lot more to offer
than just a fine young body.

260
00:32:59,438 --> 00:33:00,272
I have it up here.

261
00:33:01,399 --> 00:33:03,859
- That's too bad.

262
00:33:03,901 --> 00:33:07,196
All I'm really interested in is your body.

263
00:33:10,950 --> 00:33:13,077
- Same time, same place?

264
00:33:13,160 --> 00:33:14,412
Maybe.

265
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:43,399
- Hey there.

266
00:33:46,485 --> 00:33:48,237
Well, what do you think?

267
00:33:49,572 --> 00:33:51,032
- It's...

268
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:53,492
... intense.

269
00:34:08,090 --> 00:34:09,842
- There's something very tragic and terribly -

270
00:34:09,967 --> 00:34:11,802
- exciting that has happened in your life.

271
00:34:18,309 --> 00:34:20,478
See, women only change their
hair if it's one of the two.

272
00:34:23,272 --> 00:34:25,066
- I don't know.

273
00:34:25,149 --> 00:34:26,776
I think I was just bored.

274
00:34:26,859 --> 00:34:28,819
- Oh, come on, I bet
it was something exciting.

275
00:34:28,903 --> 00:34:30,780
- Like what?

276
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:32,740
- I confess, I'm not
really a fortune teller.

277
00:34:35,159 --> 00:34:38,537
You've such a pretty face, you shouldn't
hide it behind that new hairstyle.

278
00:34:38,829 --> 00:34:39,789
- Donald?

279
00:34:41,957 --> 00:34:43,376
Thought I'd find you here.

280
00:34:43,459 --> 00:34:45,419
- Lily, meet Angela, my wife.

281
00:34:45,586 --> 00:34:48,798
Angela, this is Lily, our new babysitter.

282
00:34:51,175 --> 00:34:52,259
- Nice to meet you, Lily.

283
00:34:54,470 --> 00:34:56,347
- 12 Mississippi.

284
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,017
13 Mississippi.

285
00:35:01,227 --> 00:35:02,978
14 Mississippi.

286
00:35:09,193 --> 00:35:11,278
15 Mississippi.

287
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:12,989
- I'm ready!

288
00:35:13,155 --> 00:35:15,866
- 16 Mississippi.

289
00:35:15,950 --> 00:35:17,827
- Lily, hurry up!

290
00:35:19,120 --> 00:35:20,830
- 17,18, 19 -

291
00:35:20,997 --> 00:35:23,249
20!

292
00:35:25,918 --> 00:35:27,837
Daphna?

293
00:35:48,399 --> 00:35:49,859
Got you!

294
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:51,819
I must say, Daphna -

295
00:35:51,902 --> 00:35:53,529
- you are a great hider.

296
00:35:53,863 --> 00:35:54,822
- Thank you!

297
00:35:54,947 --> 00:35:56,365
- You're welcome.

298
00:36:00,202 --> 00:36:03,331
- Those are pictures of daddy's paintings.

299
00:36:03,497 --> 00:36:05,082
He doesn't like to paint anymore.

300
00:36:10,212 --> 00:36:11,255
- Why?

301
00:36:12,590 --> 00:36:15,509
- Mama says it's because
painting makes him crazy.

302
00:36:21,891 --> 00:36:24,060
- Daphna, where are you?

303
00:36:24,226 --> 00:36:25,728
- I'm gonna hide again.

304
00:36:43,245 --> 00:36:44,163
- Hi baby!

305
00:36:48,626 --> 00:36:50,252
What you've been up to?

306
00:36:50,419 --> 00:36:51,796
- I did the portrait.

307
00:36:51,879 --> 00:36:53,130
- Great!

308
00:36:53,297 --> 00:36:55,800
- Angela's getting back to her photography.

309
00:36:55,966 --> 00:36:57,510
She always said she'd give Daphna four years -

310
00:36:57,593 --> 00:36:59,470
- but lucky Daphna got a full seven!

311
00:37:01,305 --> 00:37:02,306
- Right.

312
00:37:03,432 --> 00:37:05,226
- Why don't you take Lily home?

313
00:37:05,309 --> 00:37:08,437
- Hello, I'm hiding but no
one's coming to find me!

314
00:37:12,108 --> 00:37:13,109
...

315
00:37:18,239 --> 00:37:19,240
- So...

316
00:37:22,868 --> 00:37:25,329
- So, why don't you tell me a
little bit about yourself, Lily?

317
00:37:26,497 --> 00:37:27,999
Where was it you were from?

318
00:37:29,166 --> 00:37:30,251
- You'll laugh.

319
00:37:33,587 --> 00:37:35,089
Kalamazoo, Michigan.

320
00:37:36,882 --> 00:37:38,509
Born and bred.

321
00:37:38,592 --> 00:37:40,177
....

322
00:37:40,261 --> 00:37:42,430
Well, that's a big move, huh?

323
00:37:42,471 --> 00:37:45,016
All the way out to California by yourself?

324
00:37:46,892 --> 00:37:49,061
- I was really scared at first.

325
00:37:49,186 --> 00:37:52,189
I think I made the right decision.

326
00:37:52,356 --> 00:37:53,399
- Definitely.

327
00:37:53,482 --> 00:37:56,819
Can't afford to be afraid
at your stage of the game.

328
00:38:01,198 --> 00:38:02,450
Right up here?

329
00:38:02,616 --> 00:38:03,826
- Yeah, that's it.

330
00:38:06,329 --> 00:38:07,830
- I guess I better let you off.

331
00:38:09,290 --> 00:38:10,249
- Thanks a lot.

332
00:38:11,500 --> 00:38:13,127
- Your bag!

333
00:38:13,169 --> 00:38:14,170
- Thanks.

334
00:38:15,296 --> 00:38:18,049
- Listen, if you wanna show me some
of your other works sometime -

335
00:38:18,215 --> 00:38:20,176
- I'd love to see it.

336
00:38:20,259 --> 00:38:21,969
- Like when, right after class?

337
00:38:22,136 --> 00:38:24,180
- Yeah, I'm in the studio every afternoon.

338
00:38:24,347 --> 00:38:25,348
Back of the faculty building.

339
00:38:28,267 --> 00:38:29,268
- Yeah, maybe I'll do that.

340
00:38:29,352 --> 00:38:30,353
...

341
00:39:02,927 --> 00:39:04,387
June 1st.

342
00:39:04,470 --> 00:39:07,473
Ivy's philosophy, number 21.

343
00:39:07,848 --> 00:39:09,100
Never fall in love.

344
00:39:11,310 --> 00:39:13,771
For as long as I can
break somebody's heart -

345
00:39:13,938 --> 00:39:15,398
- that's love enough for me.

346
00:39:29,829 --> 00:39:31,747
How do you know what you can do -

347
00:39:31,789 --> 00:39:32,999
- until you do it?

348
00:39:54,937 --> 00:39:56,272
- How are you?

349
00:39:56,439 --> 00:39:57,732
- Good, and you?

350
00:39:59,108 --> 00:40:00,067
- I'm good.

351
00:40:01,319 --> 00:40:02,320
- Thirsty?

352
00:40:03,946 --> 00:40:05,031
- Sure.

353
00:40:49,200 --> 00:40:50,242
- You don't like it?

354
00:40:53,913 --> 00:40:55,331
- I think you look incredibly sexy!

355
00:40:58,542 --> 00:41:00,252
- I'm glad you like it.

356
00:41:00,378 --> 00:41:01,462
- Did Donald like it?

357
00:41:06,342 --> 00:41:08,302
I saw him dropping you off.

358
00:41:08,469 --> 00:41:10,429
Seems like you're becoming
a regular teacher's pet.

359
00:41:13,849 --> 00:41:15,101
- No, just his babysitter.

360
00:41:31,242 --> 00:41:33,119
Do you still think that I'm different?

361
00:41:34,537 --> 00:41:35,663
Beautiful?

362
00:41:42,336 --> 00:41:43,337
- May I?

363
00:41:55,182 --> 00:41:56,225
- May I?

364
00:42:19,540 --> 00:42:32,053
Valeria Andrews: Aching for You

365
00:44:53,319 --> 00:44:54,779
There I was again.

366
00:44:54,862 --> 00:44:58,491
Going out into the unknown,
just because.

367
00:45:43,452 --> 00:45:45,287
- Do you remember me?

368
00:45:53,546 --> 00:45:55,256
Take me with you!

369
00:45:57,299 --> 00:45:58,342
- I can't.

370
00:46:50,227 --> 00:46:51,979
- You didn't think I'd come, did you?

371
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:55,816
- I wasn't sure.

372
00:46:58,069 --> 00:46:59,111
Bring it here.

373
00:47:22,176 --> 00:47:23,719
Great Midwest.

374
00:47:27,098 --> 00:47:28,265
Looks nice.

375
00:47:29,558 --> 00:47:30,768
- Thanks.

376
00:47:32,561 --> 00:47:34,063
- Good student.

377
00:47:37,483 --> 00:47:38,526
Student?

378
00:47:39,819 --> 00:47:43,155
- Well... Still very cautious.

379
00:47:44,865 --> 00:47:45,992
Careful.

380
00:47:50,913 --> 00:47:53,249
- You know, it's ...

381
00:47:53,290 --> 00:47:55,001
... it's sort of funny to me -

382
00:47:55,126 --> 00:47:57,211
- the way you can -

383
00:47:57,378 --> 00:47:59,797
- teach and judge -

384
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:02,800
- and yet you yourself
no longer paint.

385
00:48:05,302 --> 00:48:06,470
- You think that's funny?

386
00:48:08,139 --> 00:48:10,349
- No, actually I think it's bullshit.

387
00:48:15,271 --> 00:48:17,189
- What do you propose
to do about it?

388
00:48:19,150 --> 00:48:20,109
- I don't know.

389
00:48:23,279 --> 00:48:24,739
- See...

390
00:48:25,781 --> 00:48:27,199
... being an artist ...

391
00:48:29,869 --> 00:48:32,038
... in order to be a serious artist -

392
00:48:33,456 --> 00:48:36,250
- you have to be willing
to sacrifice everything.

393
00:48:36,417 --> 00:48:39,420
You have to confront
your demons.

394
00:48:39,462 --> 00:48:41,088
Go into battle with them.

395
00:48:43,883 --> 00:48:45,259
- That's what I want.

396
00:48:46,927 --> 00:48:48,137
I'm ready for that.

397
00:48:48,220 --> 00:48:50,056
Really?

398
00:48:53,851 --> 00:48:57,188
I lost a few battles
along the way myself.

399
00:48:58,939 --> 00:49:00,399
That's why I stopped painting.

400
00:49:07,281 --> 00:49:10,743
- Well then, maybe -

401
00:49:10,910 --> 00:49:12,787
- I can help you face your fears?

402
00:49:14,413 --> 00:49:16,791
And you can help me face mine?

403
00:49:18,876 --> 00:49:20,002
- You sure?

404
00:49:32,390 --> 00:49:33,349
Sit down.

405
00:49:37,186 --> 00:49:38,145
Do it.

406
00:50:06,215 --> 00:50:08,009
Take off your clothes.

407
00:50:13,556 --> 00:50:15,016
Does that prospect frighten you?

408
00:50:15,891 --> 00:50:18,102
- Yeah, a little.

409
00:50:21,897 --> 00:50:23,899
- Then all the more
reason to do it, right?

410
00:51:05,066 --> 00:51:13,407
Simone Shook: Deeper

411
00:53:55,152 --> 00:53:56,237
- See ya.

412
00:53:57,989 --> 00:53:59,073
- Tomorrow?

413
00:54:12,420 --> 00:54:14,380
- I'm really late for work.

414
00:54:15,881 --> 00:54:19,260
You know, you make me feel like one of
those seduced and abandonded cases.

415
00:54:20,678 --> 00:54:23,431
This isn't a boy-girl thing, Gredin.

416
00:54:23,597 --> 00:54:25,057
This is a work thing

417
00:54:27,309 --> 00:54:28,269
- Are you sure?

418
00:54:31,397 --> 00:54:33,316
- Don't be so insecure.

419
00:55:28,371 --> 00:55:31,040
Hi, this is Lily.
I can't get to the phone -

420
00:55:31,123 --> 00:55:34,210
- so leave your message
after the beep. Thanks.

421
00:56:11,372 --> 00:56:13,249
- Got you!

422
00:56:13,290 --> 00:56:15,042
We're having a party tonight.

423
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:16,168
It's gonna be pretty loud so -

424
00:56:16,252 --> 00:56:19,046
- I just thought I'd let you know.

425
00:56:27,388 --> 00:56:28,723
Fuck her.

426
00:56:37,898 --> 00:56:39,400
- Yo, over here!

427
00:56:40,568 --> 00:56:42,528
Hey, you  beautiful man!

428
00:56:44,572 --> 00:56:46,365
Stop pushing to me!

429
00:56:47,450 --> 00:56:48,951
My god, it's so high.

430
00:56:49,118 --> 00:56:51,287
Why put a sculpture all the way up here?

431
00:56:52,496 --> 00:56:53,497
Here's beer.

432
00:56:56,083 --> 00:56:57,251
...

433
00:57:00,212 --> 00:57:04,300
You better not dance with
anybody but me tonight.

434
00:57:04,383 --> 00:57:06,302
You're so sexy!

435
00:57:08,888 --> 00:57:10,139
Fuck him.

436
00:57:11,182 --> 00:57:13,517
- Oh, there's gonna be so much fun.

437
00:57:16,228 --> 00:57:17,229
Fuck'em all.

438
00:58:20,418 --> 00:58:21,961
- Are you out of your mind?

439
00:58:23,212 --> 00:58:25,047
Why would you wanna do
something like that?

440
00:58:26,549 --> 00:58:28,050
- Self expression?

441
00:58:29,552 --> 00:58:32,221
- Wait a minute, first you cut off all your hair -

442
00:58:32,388 --> 00:58:33,889
- then you pierce your belly button -

443
00:58:34,056 --> 00:58:35,891
- and now you're smoking?

444
00:58:36,058 --> 00:58:37,727
What the hell's going on with you?

445
00:58:41,355 --> 00:58:44,358
Tanya, don't you have a super highway -

446
00:58:44,442 --> 00:58:45,776
- you need to get on?

447
00:58:47,320 --> 00:58:49,030
Why don't you go out
and have some fun?

448
00:58:54,201 --> 00:58:55,703
- I was just leaving.

449
00:59:00,833 --> 00:59:03,252
Guess I won't introduce you to Roxanne.

450
00:59:52,176 --> 00:59:54,220
- What should I have?

451
00:59:54,387 --> 00:59:55,721
- How about an Ice breaker?

452
00:59:57,348 --> 01:00:00,059
- And what exactly is an Ice breaker?

453
01:00:00,142 --> 01:00:01,769
- Turn around and I'll show you.

454
01:00:05,189 --> 01:00:06,190
Don't move.

455
01:00:29,130 --> 01:00:31,507
Ice breaker it is.

456
01:00:35,052 --> 01:00:36,053
Thanks.

457
01:01:12,882 --> 01:01:14,091
Dance with me.

458
01:01:48,793 --> 01:01:49,752
Oh my god.

459
01:01:54,256 --> 01:01:56,175
- No one's safe with you around!

460
01:01:57,426 --> 01:01:59,053
Yeah, you've got a problem with that?

461
01:05:49,200 --> 01:05:52,370
Hi, this is Lily,
I can't get to the phone -

462
01:05:52,453 --> 01:05:54,789
- so leave me a message
after the beep.

463
01:05:54,955 --> 01:05:56,499
Thanks.

464
01:05:56,582 --> 01:05:58,793
- Lily, it's your mum.

465
01:05:58,918 --> 01:06:00,920
Lily, we're worried about you.

466
01:06:01,087 --> 01:06:02,380
Your dad want's to talk to you.

467
01:06:02,463 --> 01:06:04,507
- Hey kiddo, how you doing?

468
01:06:04,548 --> 01:06:06,175
Please call home, darling -

469
01:06:06,258 --> 01:06:08,219
- your mother's driving me crazy.

470
01:06:08,302 --> 01:06:10,137
Hey, we'll see you
at Thanksgiving, right?

471
01:06:13,599 --> 01:06:15,059
- God.

472
01:06:21,983 --> 01:06:23,192
- Is that the time?

473
01:06:27,321 --> 01:06:29,490
I'm late for Donald's class.

474
01:06:29,615 --> 01:06:31,701
- So we're late for professor Falks class?

475
01:06:31,867 --> 01:06:33,703
What's the big deal?

476
01:06:33,869 --> 01:06:35,830
I wanna go.
That's what the big deal is.

477
01:06:37,206 --> 01:06:38,165
- So go.

478
01:06:39,917 --> 01:06:41,460
- What do you think I'm trying to do?

479
01:06:58,519 --> 01:07:00,479
- What are you doing for Thanksgiving?

480
01:07:00,896 --> 01:07:02,023
- I don't know yet.

481
01:07:04,317 --> 01:07:07,820
- Bridgette, Tanya and Robert
are gonna go home.

482
01:07:17,163 --> 01:07:19,040
It's gonna get rather lonely around here.

483
01:07:20,583 --> 01:07:22,460
- What about you?
What are you gonna do?

484
01:08:12,093 --> 01:08:13,260
- Who was that on the phone?

485
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:23,980
- I don't know.

486
01:08:24,063 --> 01:08:26,357
Somebody who obviously
didn't want to talk to me.

487
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:29,110
You know, there seem to be
a whole lot of "I don't know".

488
01:08:35,449 --> 01:08:36,409
Don't.

489
01:08:42,206 --> 01:08:43,207
- What's the matter?

490
01:08:44,792 --> 01:08:45,960
What did I do?

491
01:08:46,127 --> 01:08:47,128
- You tell me.

492
01:08:50,339 --> 01:08:52,008
What are you doing?

493
01:08:55,052 --> 01:08:56,345
I wanna know, Lily.

494
01:08:56,429 --> 01:08:59,765
- I really can't have this
conversation right now -

495
01:08:59,849 --> 01:09:01,767
- because I'm late for class.

496
01:09:18,659 --> 01:09:20,202
- I don't know who you are anymore.

497
01:09:22,079 --> 01:09:24,040
I don't know who I'm
making love to anymore.

498
01:09:26,375 --> 01:09:28,377
If this is some kind of contest, Lily...

499
01:09:30,379 --> 01:09:31,380
... I don't wanna compete.

500
01:10:11,379 --> 01:10:13,756
I thought you wrote these.

501
01:10:52,503 --> 01:10:53,796
- What a nice surprise!

502
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:56,465
- Thought you might be hungry.

503
01:10:56,549 --> 01:10:58,009
- As a matter of fact I am, thanks.

504
01:10:58,092 --> 01:10:59,301
- Since when do you lock the door?

505
01:11:00,636 --> 01:11:02,430
- Since last ...

506
01:11:15,901 --> 01:11:17,320
- You're painting again?

507
01:11:17,361 --> 01:11:19,071
- Delicious honey, thanks!

508
01:11:21,073 --> 01:11:21,991
- Can I have a look?

509
01:11:23,826 --> 01:11:24,910
- No, you don't have to ask.

510
01:11:25,077 --> 01:11:27,788
When I have something to
show you, I'll show you.

511
01:11:36,839 --> 01:11:38,007
- You OK?

512
01:11:38,090 --> 01:11:39,300
- Yeah, I'm fine.

513
01:11:39,467 --> 01:11:40,468
Why?

514
01:11:42,178 --> 01:11:43,262
- So you're painting?

515
01:11:45,473 --> 01:11:47,141
- No one in particular.

516
01:11:51,228 --> 01:11:52,772
- OK, fine.

517
01:11:52,938 --> 01:11:56,275
- What do you want me to do,
stand in front of my class
for the rest of my life -

518
01:11:56,359 --> 01:11:57,360
- and nag about stuff
I don't have the guts to do anymore,
like a hipocrite?

519
01:11:57,443 --> 01:11:59,779
- That's not what we're talking about.

520
01:11:59,862 --> 01:12:02,031
I don't want to lose you again.

521
01:12:02,198 --> 01:12:04,992
And especially not to some 21 year old -

522
01:12:05,117 --> 01:12:08,079
- undergraduate who looks up to
you as a god as poses between fucks.

523
01:12:09,580 --> 01:12:12,333
- You and Daphna are my life.

524
01:12:12,458 --> 01:12:14,210
And I love you very much.

525
01:12:15,419 --> 01:12:18,172
...

526
01:12:19,173 --> 01:12:22,093
The last time nearly killed us, Donald.

527
01:12:22,218 --> 01:12:23,469
- Right.

528
01:13:11,392 --> 01:13:13,436
- Well, where were you today?

529
01:13:14,478 --> 01:13:15,438
- What do you mean?

530
01:13:17,648 --> 01:13:20,401
- You weren't in class, neither was Gredin.

531
01:13:20,568 --> 01:13:22,486
Any connection between the two?

532
01:13:24,488 --> 01:13:26,365
- You know, I'm gonna go...

533
01:13:26,449 --> 01:13:28,242
- Wait, wait, just tell me.

534
01:13:29,410 --> 01:13:30,369
Were you with him?

535
01:13:36,208 --> 01:13:37,501
- Wait.

536
01:13:37,626 --> 01:13:38,753
Don't go.

537
01:13:40,296 --> 01:13:41,339
I don't want you to go.

538
01:13:42,882 --> 01:13:44,133
Can't let you go.

539
01:13:45,593 --> 01:13:47,470
Can't stop thinking about you.

540
01:13:49,221 --> 01:13:51,098
That painting is the first
one I've made in years -

541
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:52,350
- and it's because of you.

542
01:13:56,228 --> 01:13:58,439
I've never felt this way
before in my life.

543
01:14:00,399 --> 01:14:01,817
Help me overcome my fear.

544
01:14:05,112 --> 01:14:06,113
- Big scary cat.

545
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:11,786
- Love you for it.

546
01:14:16,916 --> 01:14:18,000
- Donald, what are you doing?

547
01:14:19,418 --> 01:14:20,419
- Kissing you.

548
01:14:21,420 --> 01:14:23,005
Falling in love with you.

549
01:14:24,340 --> 01:14:25,341
- Don't.

550
01:14:27,259 --> 01:14:28,219
- Why?

551
01:14:29,178 --> 01:14:30,471
- Just don't.

552
01:14:34,809 --> 01:14:35,810
- Come here.

553
01:15:50,593 --> 01:15:52,178
- What?

554
01:15:52,219 --> 01:15:54,180
- Beauty scares me.

555
01:15:57,183 --> 01:15:58,517
Terrifies me.

556
01:17:28,357 --> 01:17:29,775
Wait, wait.

557
01:17:36,615 --> 01:17:37,783
Who is it?

558
01:17:37,908 --> 01:17:39,160
- It's Diana.

559
01:17:39,201 --> 01:17:40,536
- Not right now, OK?

560
01:17:40,870 --> 01:17:42,830
- Alright, I come back.

561
01:17:52,173 --> 01:17:54,091
- It's alright.

562
01:17:54,216 --> 01:17:55,217
Stay.

563
01:19:14,130 --> 01:19:16,007
- I'm really sorry -

564
01:19:16,090 --> 01:19:18,301
- about the way I've been acting lately.

565
01:19:21,262 --> 01:19:24,348
This is just a really hard transition for me -

566
01:19:24,432 --> 01:19:25,766
- and I...

567
01:19:30,313 --> 01:19:32,023
I've been confused.

568
01:19:35,109 --> 01:19:36,736
But I'm not confused anymore.

569
01:20:03,471 --> 01:20:05,139
Please don't give up on me.

570
01:20:23,366 --> 01:20:26,369
- Don't just stand there, Donald.
Invite them in.

571
01:20:26,452 --> 01:20:29,038
This is Gredin, he was kinda
homeless so I invited him.

572
01:20:29,121 --> 01:20:30,790
I hope you don't mind.

573
01:20:31,040 --> 01:20:33,000
- No, not at all. Hi Gredin.

574
01:20:33,125 --> 01:20:34,752
You two know each other?

575
01:20:34,877 --> 01:20:36,671
- Yeah, he's in my class.

576
01:20:37,838 --> 01:20:40,216
- Oh.

577
01:20:43,886 --> 01:20:46,847
- Wow, it feels great in here.
Can I do anything?

578
01:20:46,889 --> 01:20:48,766
- You can set a plate for Gredin.

579
01:20:48,849 --> 01:20:50,726
- Hi, Lily!

580
01:20:52,937 --> 01:20:54,313
Can I ask you something?

581
01:20:54,438 --> 01:20:55,773
Is Gredin your boyfriend?

582
01:20:57,566 --> 01:20:58,526
- Is that you?

583
01:20:58,859 --> 01:21:02,029
- Yeah. Yes, it is.

584
01:21:02,071 --> 01:21:04,198
Donald painted that a long time ago.

585
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:05,741
That's me.

586
01:21:07,868 --> 01:21:10,329
Come in.

587
01:21:10,496 --> 01:21:11,497
I'll show you around.

588
01:21:37,440 --> 01:21:38,399
- Very good.

589
01:21:38,482 --> 01:21:39,775
- Very nice.

590
01:21:51,329 --> 01:21:54,040
- Why didn't you tell me
you were inviting Lily?

591
01:21:54,081 --> 01:21:55,082
- Thought I did.

592
01:21:56,083 --> 01:21:57,460
- You didn't.

593
01:21:57,835 --> 01:21:59,086
- All set.

594
01:22:00,880 --> 01:22:01,797
- Good idea.

595
01:22:02,089 --> 01:22:03,049
Thanks.

596
01:22:10,097 --> 01:22:12,308
Will be good with this one, Lily.

597
01:22:12,391 --> 01:22:13,392
Please.

598
01:22:14,393 --> 01:22:15,978
Will you bring the cranberries for me?

599
01:22:19,649 --> 01:22:21,150
Lily, grab the mineral water, would you?

600
01:22:21,275 --> 01:22:22,401
It's in the fridge.

601
01:22:31,410 --> 01:22:33,829
I'm glad you're here.

602
01:22:37,249 --> 01:22:38,292
What's up, where are you going?

603
01:22:39,919 --> 01:22:41,379
- Into the other room.

604
01:22:41,462 --> 01:22:42,463
Where do you think I'm going?

605
01:22:42,630 --> 01:22:44,799
- Wait just a second.

606
01:22:44,840 --> 01:22:46,050
- Don't.

607
01:22:46,175 --> 01:22:47,218
- Let me just look at you.

608
01:22:51,555 --> 01:22:52,807
Why did you bring him?

609
01:22:53,891 --> 01:22:55,351
- Because he's my boyfriend.

610
01:23:05,111 --> 01:23:07,321
- So, Gredin, why don't you sit over here?

611
01:23:07,488 --> 01:23:09,240
Lily, next to Gredin.

612
01:23:09,323 --> 01:23:11,325
Daphna, you're here beside Lily.

613
01:23:19,291 --> 01:23:21,043
Donald,
you're over here next to me.

614
01:23:28,509 --> 01:23:30,052
- Do you have a cake for Johnny?

615
01:23:30,219 --> 01:23:31,429
- Of course.

616
01:24:30,571 --> 01:24:33,366
- I'm finished mum. I'm gonna hide.

617
01:24:33,449 --> 01:24:35,368
- Fine honey, you go ahead.

618
01:24:47,630 --> 01:24:50,257
- So, Lily tells me you're a photographer.

619
01:24:50,341 --> 01:24:54,178
I used to be.
Making a comeback.

620
01:24:54,261 --> 01:24:55,471
And you're a painter?

621
01:24:55,638 --> 01:24:58,057
I'm a sculptor mostly.

622
01:24:58,099 --> 01:24:59,266
- An amazing sculptor.

623
01:24:59,350 --> 01:25:01,102
- A diversion of life study.

624
01:25:02,269 --> 01:25:04,146
- That's not entirely true.

625
01:25:04,230 --> 01:25:06,232
- Really, used to be.

626
01:25:08,442 --> 01:25:10,486
- Me and Donald agree on a couple of things.

627
01:25:12,613 --> 01:25:14,448
Like your beauty, for example.

628
01:25:17,618 --> 01:25:20,037
I've never seen your work before.

629
01:25:20,121 --> 01:25:21,122
It's good.

630
01:25:21,288 --> 01:25:24,041
- It's amazing what you can do
with the right subject.

631
01:25:27,420 --> 01:25:29,296
- Donald's painting again.

632
01:25:30,589 --> 01:25:33,759
First time in a long while.

633
01:25:33,801 --> 01:25:35,177
- I'll get some more wine.

634
01:25:35,261 --> 01:25:36,262
- He's really serious about it.

635
01:25:38,347 --> 01:25:39,432
It's a secret.

636
01:25:42,310 --> 01:25:44,478
- So, ehm ...

637
01:25:44,562 --> 01:25:46,731
... how did you and Donald meet?

638
01:25:50,609 --> 01:25:52,361
- I wanted to do a life study class.

639
01:25:52,528 --> 01:25:56,073
I heard about this single,
brilliant, good looking -

640
01:25:56,198 --> 01:25:59,076
- professor -

641
01:25:59,160 --> 01:26:01,037
- and weazled my way into his class.

642
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:03,289
And the rest is history.

643
01:26:03,372 --> 01:26:05,333
Bit of a cliche, I know.

644
01:26:08,586 --> 01:26:10,046
- Some more?

645
01:26:10,129 --> 01:26:11,130
- Thanks.

646
01:26:12,840 --> 01:26:16,469
- Angela was just telling us
how the two of you met.

647
01:26:16,510 --> 01:26:19,180
- For God's sake, let's not
bore them with out trivia.

648
01:26:20,598 --> 01:26:24,393
- I never actually thought of
it as trivia, Donald.

649
01:26:59,595 --> 01:27:00,513
- Where's Daphna?

650
01:27:00,638 --> 01:27:02,098
- Sound asleep.

651
01:27:03,265 --> 01:27:05,017
- She should be in bed, shouldn't she?

652
01:27:10,231 --> 01:27:13,109
Come on sweety, let's go.

653
01:27:15,152 --> 01:27:16,237
- I'll take her.

654
01:27:16,278 --> 01:27:20,199
- No, I want daddy and Lily to take me.

655
01:27:20,282 --> 01:27:22,076
- Well...

656
01:27:23,369 --> 01:27:24,370
- Good night.

657
01:27:36,590 --> 01:27:38,175
- Let me give you a hand.

658
01:27:38,259 --> 01:27:39,260
- Yeah, thank you.

659
01:27:51,188 --> 01:27:52,732
- There you go.

660
01:27:54,108 --> 01:27:55,443
Sleep tight, beautiful.

661
01:27:59,238 --> 01:28:00,489
- Good night, little girl.

662
01:28:00,531 --> 01:28:02,158
- Good night, big girl.

663
01:28:12,460 --> 01:28:13,502
- What are you doing?

664
01:28:13,669 --> 01:28:15,296
- What does it feel like I'm doing?

665
01:28:16,505 --> 01:28:18,466
- Are you fucking crazy?

666
01:28:18,549 --> 01:28:20,259
- I'm fucking crazy about you.

667
01:28:25,848 --> 01:28:27,141
- What was that?

668
01:28:31,979 --> 01:28:32,980
I cut myself.

669
01:28:35,566 --> 01:28:36,776
- Here.

670
01:28:36,859 --> 01:28:38,778
- Right here?

671
01:28:38,819 --> 01:28:40,988
Will you fuck me right here?

672
01:28:44,283 --> 01:28:46,160
You don't love me.

673
01:28:46,285 --> 01:28:48,245
Let go of me.

674
01:28:49,163 --> 01:28:50,206
- Love me.

675
01:29:00,216 --> 01:29:01,258
Lily, love me.

676
01:29:19,193 --> 01:29:21,237
- Get off me.

677
01:30:11,120 --> 01:30:12,371
- Don't you dare touch her!

678
01:30:15,249 --> 01:30:17,418
- Shit.

679
01:30:17,501 --> 01:30:18,502
- Don't you dare touch her!

680
01:30:18,878 --> 01:30:19,837
- Calm down.

681
01:30:26,052 --> 01:30:28,137
- 911, state your emergency.

682
01:30:28,220 --> 01:30:29,722
Mama?

683
01:32:30,509 --> 01:32:32,053
- Fuck you, Ivy.

684
01:33:12,259 --> 01:33:13,260
Shit.

685
01:35:34,568 --> 01:35:36,195
- Daphna's gonna be fine.

686
01:35:38,239 --> 01:35:39,782
I don't know if you care.

687
01:35:41,158 --> 01:35:42,201
- And you?

688
01:35:43,869 --> 01:35:46,789
- Am I fine or do I care?

689
01:36:12,523 --> 01:36:14,066
- I can't let you go, Lily!

690
01:36:16,610 --> 01:36:18,362
Not after everything we've been through.

691
01:36:21,073 --> 01:36:22,033
- It's over, Donald.

692
01:36:25,077 --> 01:36:27,496
- Don't fight me, Lily.

693
01:36:35,546 --> 01:36:37,298
Don't shut me out.

694
01:36:41,427 --> 01:36:44,263
I can't let you go, Lily.

695
01:36:44,388 --> 01:36:46,140
I love you too much, I ...

696
01:37:03,491 --> 01:37:04,742
Get off!

697
01:37:38,192 --> 01:37:40,319
- I'm not gonna hurt you Lily, just let me in.

698
01:37:40,403 --> 01:37:41,779
- The police are on their way.

699
01:38:05,469 --> 01:38:08,806
- I never meant to hurt you.

700
01:38:08,889 --> 01:38:11,100
You'll have to believe me.

701
01:38:12,476 --> 01:38:13,769
What are you doing?

702
01:38:50,890 --> 01:38:52,350
Go, baby.

703
01:38:55,269 --> 01:38:58,272
Go, go.

704
01:40:50,092 --> 01:40:52,470
- I know it's pointless to
ask you to forgive me.

705
01:40:55,348 --> 01:40:57,391
OK, well.
I just gotta talk.

706
01:40:57,558 --> 01:41:00,436
Then you won't have to
deal with me anymore.

707
01:41:07,568 --> 01:41:08,986
My whole life -

708
01:41:10,112 --> 01:41:12,490
- I've felt like a freak.

709
01:41:12,907 --> 01:41:14,825
You know, back home in Michigan -

710
01:41:16,619 --> 01:41:19,538
- I wasn't accepted because
I was different -

711
01:41:19,580 --> 01:41:22,166
- and then I come here -

712
01:41:22,249 --> 01:41:24,669
- I'm not different enough.

713
01:41:30,216 --> 01:41:32,093
So -

714
01:41:32,218 --> 01:41:33,219
- I decided -

715
01:41:34,470 --> 01:41:36,305
- to become someone else.

716
01:41:37,848 --> 01:41:38,933
Someone -

717
01:41:40,059 --> 01:41:42,728
- tough and infallible.

718
01:41:44,772 --> 01:41:47,692
Beautiful and sexy.

719
01:41:49,819 --> 01:41:50,987
Fearless.

720
01:41:53,280 --> 01:41:54,740
And it worked.

721
01:41:56,867 --> 01:42:01,122
For the first time in my
life I was accepted.

722
01:42:05,501 --> 01:42:08,963
And I became intoxicated by
the freedom of it all.

723
01:42:11,841 --> 01:42:13,301
Until it was too late.

724
01:42:16,262 --> 01:42:17,722
It's too late, isn't it?

725
01:42:28,357 --> 01:42:29,317
Well ...

726
01:42:31,235 --> 01:42:32,320
For what it's worth...

727
01:42:36,407 --> 01:42:37,450
I love you.

728
01:42:43,331 --> 01:42:48,336
- I love you.
