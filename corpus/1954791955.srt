00:01:06,491 --> 00:01:09,491
Ha ha ha!

8
00:01:12,596 --> 00:01:15,697
What are you waiting on, Tony?

9
00:01:22,204 --> 00:01:24,170
Handle your business.

10
00:01:25,173 --> 00:01:27,473
I've got $100 in this pocket

11
00:01:27,475 --> 00:01:29,575
that says he don't do it.

12
00:01:29,577 --> 00:01:31,209
You got a bet.

13
00:01:31,211 --> 00:01:33,244
Here you go, Tony.

14
00:01:33,246 --> 00:01:35,746
Don't let me down, man.

15
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:39,282
I'm betting on you.

16
00:01:41,853 --> 00:01:44,654
Tony, voice-over:
Now, a lot of you guys

17
00:01:44,655 --> 00:01:47,456
might be surprised
at what I'm about to say.

18
00:01:47,458 --> 00:01:49,825
And you'll want to know,
who is this guy

19
00:01:49,827 --> 00:01:51,827
that talks so sly,

20
00:01:51,829 --> 00:01:54,830
and where did he learn to play?

21
00:01:54,832 --> 00:01:59,134
Well, I'm about to tell you
the way that I failed...

22
00:01:59,136 --> 00:02:03,304
And the dirty trick
that fate played on me.

23
00:02:03,306 --> 00:02:05,539
These are swinging sounds
I'm running down

24
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:08,808
so you will dig my history.

25
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:18,936
Man: Come on, Manny.

26
00:04:18,937 --> 00:04:19,903
Show them what you got, baby.

27
00:04:19,905 --> 00:04:21,804
Manny: Yeah, I told you.

28
00:04:21,806 --> 00:04:22,771
Oh, yeah, chino.

29
00:04:24,941 --> 00:04:27,574
Be jamming it! Be jamming it!

30
00:04:27,576 --> 00:04:28,808
Oh, look at that!

31
00:04:28,810 --> 00:04:31,977
Sammy sosa!

32
00:04:31,979 --> 00:04:32,944
<i>Oye, Hector.</i>

33
00:04:36,248 --> 00:04:38,715
No trick-or-treat on pope.

34
00:04:38,717 --> 00:04:39,582
Cool deal.

35
00:04:43,787 --> 00:04:47,889
Oh! Oh, you...
Look at that shit.

36
00:04:47,891 --> 00:04:49,523
Oh, yeah, Freddie.

37
00:04:49,525 --> 00:04:52,459
Come on, papa. Get off
my fucking car, man.

38
00:04:53,929 --> 00:04:55,795
What's that look like to you?

39
00:04:55,797 --> 00:04:56,662
Fucking lunch cart?

40
00:04:56,664 --> 00:04:58,430
Get off the fucking car.

41
00:05:04,403 --> 00:05:06,669
Shit, man.

42
00:05:07,405 --> 00:05:08,904
Get this motherfucker
off my car, man.

43
00:05:08,906 --> 00:05:11,006
Get him off my fucking car.

44
00:05:11,008 --> 00:05:12,407
Hector: Hey, yo, asshole!

45
00:05:12,409 --> 00:05:13,708
Yo, what are you doing
to my Uncle's car?

46
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:16,343
Manny: Bring this
motherfucker over here.

47
00:05:16,945 --> 00:05:19,578
Aah! Aah! Aah! I'm sorry!

48
00:05:19,580 --> 00:05:21,479
What did I tell you, huh?

49
00:05:21,481 --> 00:05:23,197
Get off my car.

50
00:05:23,198 --> 00:05:24,914
Get off my fucking car,
didn't I?

51
00:05:26,852 --> 00:05:28,284
I'm sorry, Manny.

52
00:05:28,286 --> 00:05:29,669
Running your life, Freddie.

53
00:05:29,670 --> 00:05:31,053
<i>Dar me. Dar me. Dar me. Dar me.</i>

54
00:05:31,055 --> 00:05:32,471
Here you go, bro.

55
00:05:32,472 --> 00:05:33,888
This better not
be short, either.

56
00:05:33,891 --> 00:05:35,207
No way,<i> papi.</i>

57
00:05:35,208 --> 00:05:36,524
I sold that shit
lock, stock, and barrel.

58
00:05:36,526 --> 00:05:37,958
Believe that!

59
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:39,392
This ain't funny, man.

60
00:05:40,361 --> 00:05:41,460
Stop fucking around.

61
00:05:41,462 --> 00:05:42,884
You should've
seen them, too, man.

62
00:05:42,885 --> 00:05:44,307
They were sweating me.
They were all, like,

63
00:05:44,308 --> 00:05:45,730
"yo, please, Freddie.
Hook me up, man.

64
00:05:45,732 --> 00:05:47,515
I'm sick."

65
00:05:47,516 --> 00:05:49,299
But I was hard,
just like you told me.

66
00:05:49,302 --> 00:05:50,534
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

67
00:05:50,536 --> 00:05:51,735
Listen. I'm putting
Hector on a run.

68
00:05:51,737 --> 00:05:54,304
I want you to go with him.

69
00:05:58,476 --> 00:05:59,641
Damn it, Manny.

70
00:05:59,643 --> 00:06:00,642
What?

71
00:06:00,644 --> 00:06:01,643
You said you would hook me up

72
00:06:01,645 --> 00:06:02,727
with my own franchise, man.

73
00:06:02,728 --> 00:06:03,810
Why do I got to
deliver with Hector?

74
00:06:03,813 --> 00:06:05,329
Because he's my nephew

75
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:06,846
and I don't want anything
to happen to him, ok?

76
00:06:06,849 --> 00:06:07,981
Now I want you go with him,

77
00:06:07,983 --> 00:06:10,516
make sure the shit
gets delivered,

78
00:06:10,518 --> 00:06:11,984
then maybe... Hey.

79
00:06:11,986 --> 00:06:14,786
Maybe we'll talk
about a franchise.

80
00:06:14,988 --> 00:06:16,988
Yeah. How many keys?

81
00:06:16,990 --> 00:06:18,389
<i>Cuatro.</i>

82
00:06:18,391 --> 00:06:19,523
Ok.

83
00:06:19,524 --> 00:06:20,656
Make sure they get there.

84
00:06:20,659 --> 00:06:21,491
Yeah. No problem.

85
00:06:21,493 --> 00:06:22,658
Get the fuck out of here.

86
00:06:22,660 --> 00:06:23,892
<i>Oye, gato.</i>

87
00:06:23,894 --> 00:06:25,760
You fuck up on this one,

88
00:06:25,762 --> 00:06:28,462
that's another life you lose.

89
00:07:13,374 --> 00:07:15,540
Woman: Aah!

90
00:07:35,662 --> 00:07:37,662
Fuck me.

91
00:07:42,635 --> 00:07:45,502
Oh, yeah, taxi, taxi, taxi!

92
00:07:45,504 --> 00:07:48,403
Come on.

93
00:07:51,007 --> 00:07:54,008
Over here. Over here.

94
00:08:02,684 --> 00:08:04,417
I'm going to Livingston street.

95
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:06,018
Where's that? In tribecka?

96
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,753
No, no, no. Downtown Brooklyn.

97
00:08:07,755 --> 00:08:09,721
Oh, no, no. I'm sorry, no.

98
00:08:09,723 --> 00:08:11,055
I cannot take you to Brooklyn.

99
00:08:11,057 --> 00:08:12,790
What do you mean
you can't take me?

100
00:08:12,792 --> 00:08:14,691
It's quitting time
in one half hour.

101
00:08:14,693 --> 00:08:16,426
I cannot take you to Brooklyn.

102
00:08:16,428 --> 00:08:17,961
I must go to queens.

103
00:08:17,962 --> 00:08:19,495
You must take me
to my destination.

104
00:08:19,497 --> 00:08:20,863
I'm going to Brooklyn.
Let's go.

105
00:08:20,865 --> 00:08:21,864
No, no. I must ask you

106
00:08:21,866 --> 00:08:23,532
to leave my cab now, please.

107
00:08:23,534 --> 00:08:24,966
You either take me to Brooklyn,

108
00:08:24,968 --> 00:08:27,068
or you take me
to the police station.

109
00:08:27,070 --> 00:08:28,936
I cannot go.

110
00:08:28,938 --> 00:08:30,470
Either you take me to Brooklyn,

111
00:08:30,472 --> 00:08:31,971
or take my ass
to the police station.

112
00:08:31,973 --> 00:08:35,073
Otherwise, I'm not
getting out of your cab.

113
00:08:37,043 --> 00:08:39,176
Can we move this along
with a little alacrity?

114
00:08:39,178 --> 00:08:40,710
I got to take a fucking piss.

115
00:08:40,712 --> 00:08:42,912
What's this jackoff's name?

116
00:08:42,914 --> 00:08:43,963
Michael Williams.

117
00:08:43,964 --> 00:08:45,013
Want to write it
in fucking braille?

118
00:08:45,016 --> 00:08:46,482
Oh, excuse me. Gentlemen,

119
00:08:46,484 --> 00:08:47,983
could you please
escort Mr. Williams

120
00:08:47,985 --> 00:08:49,951
to the holding tank?

121
00:08:55,023 --> 00:08:56,222
Woman: Gentlemen! Gentlemen!

122
00:08:56,224 --> 00:08:58,724
Gentlemen, please!

123
00:08:58,726 --> 00:09:00,892
What seems to be
the problem here?

124
00:09:00,894 --> 00:09:03,227
Officer, I would like
to fill out a complaint.

125
00:09:03,229 --> 00:09:04,528
Oh, would you now?

126
00:09:04,530 --> 00:09:05,674
That's right.

127
00:09:05,675 --> 00:09:06,819
This<i> pendejo</i> picked me up...

128
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:07,964
refused to take me
to my destination.

129
00:09:07,966 --> 00:09:10,232
Cab driver: No.
My off-duty light was on.

130
00:09:10,234 --> 00:09:11,166
This guy got in

131
00:09:11,167 --> 00:09:12,099
while I'm stopped
at a red light.

132
00:09:12,102 --> 00:09:13,234
Liar. The man is lying.

133
00:09:13,236 --> 00:09:14,835
All right. Shut up! Shut up!

134
00:09:14,837 --> 00:09:16,136
Before I fucking smack you.

135
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:19,038
You want to fill out
a complaint?

136
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:20,806
I need your name.

137
00:09:21,942 --> 00:09:23,841
Michael Williams.

138
00:09:34,086 --> 00:09:36,219
What's the problem, officer?

139
00:09:36,221 --> 00:09:37,987
No problem at all.

140
00:09:37,989 --> 00:09:39,755
I just have to ask you
a few questions.

141
00:09:39,757 --> 00:09:40,822
That's all.

142
00:09:40,824 --> 00:09:42,257
What kind of questions?

143
00:09:42,258 --> 00:09:43,691
Just some routine
questions, sir,

144
00:09:43,693 --> 00:09:45,159
starting with your name.

145
00:09:45,161 --> 00:09:47,161
I told you before.
Michael Williams.

146
00:09:47,163 --> 00:09:48,529
Michael Williams Leon?

147
00:09:48,531 --> 00:09:49,997
No, no.<i> Lay-on.</i>

148
00:09:49,999 --> 00:09:50,998
What about my complaint?

149
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:51,965
We'll get to that in a minute.

150
00:09:51,967 --> 00:09:56,902
Date of birth,
October 31, 1967?

151
00:09:56,904 --> 00:09:57,969
What's this about?

152
00:09:57,971 --> 00:09:59,270
This is about you, nitwit.

153
00:09:59,272 --> 00:10:01,005
Michael Williams Leon?

154
00:10:01,007 --> 00:10:02,523
You got a list of prior arrests

155
00:10:02,524 --> 00:10:04,040
dating back 10 years,
but who's counting?

156
00:10:04,043 --> 00:10:05,492
I didn't do nothing.

157
00:10:05,493 --> 00:10:06,942
Not today, but you
did a bullet on riker's

158
00:10:06,945 --> 00:10:08,044
a couple of years ago,

159
00:10:08,046 --> 00:10:09,011
and that's the good news.

160
00:10:09,013 --> 00:10:10,612
You want to hear the bad news?

161
00:10:10,614 --> 00:10:12,981
You ain't been to see
your p.O. In two months.

162
00:10:12,983 --> 00:10:15,016
Now you know what
that means, don't you?

163
00:10:15,018 --> 00:10:15,983
He misses me?

164
00:10:15,985 --> 00:10:16,951
Woman: Move it.

165
00:10:16,952 --> 00:10:17,918
All you got to do
is call on him.

166
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:19,336
I was going to see him.

167
00:10:19,337 --> 00:10:20,753
Look, don't I at least
get a phone call?

168
00:10:20,756 --> 00:10:21,888
I got something better.

169
00:10:21,890 --> 00:10:23,923
Williams! Come here!

170
00:10:23,925 --> 00:10:27,159
I got someone here
I want you to meet.

171
00:10:56,289 --> 00:10:58,423
Daddy?

172
00:10:58,425 --> 00:11:00,057
What?

173
00:11:00,059 --> 00:11:03,093
What?

174
00:11:03,361 --> 00:11:05,060
Billy, stay here, all right?

175
00:11:05,062 --> 00:11:06,394
Just going to stay in the car?

176
00:11:06,396 --> 00:11:10,130
All right. Stay here.

177
00:11:12,667 --> 00:11:16,168
Jackie. Jackie! Hey!

178
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:23,041
Come on, Jackie.
Hey. Hey, come on.

179
00:11:24,377 --> 00:11:25,342
Man: There. Hey, Mikey.

180
00:11:25,344 --> 00:11:26,376
Give your daddy a kiss.

181
00:11:26,378 --> 00:11:27,310
Come over here. Come on.

182
00:11:27,312 --> 00:11:28,844
Excuse me, but you haven't seen

183
00:11:28,846 --> 00:11:30,278
this kid but twice
since he's been born.

184
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:33,114
Now all of a sudden,
you want to come around here

185
00:11:33,116 --> 00:11:35,049
and play daddy?

186
00:11:35,051 --> 00:11:36,750
Jesus, he's my kid, too,

187
00:11:36,752 --> 00:11:38,451
for Christ's sakes. Come on.

188
00:11:38,453 --> 00:11:40,152
That's not what you said to me

189
00:11:40,154 --> 00:11:42,954
when I told you
that I was pregnant.

190
00:11:46,993 --> 00:11:48,209
Fuck you, Billy.

191
00:11:48,210 --> 00:11:49,426
Whoa! Why you got
to talk to me like that

192
00:11:49,428 --> 00:11:51,662
in front of the kid?

193
00:11:51,663 --> 00:11:53,897
Why? Because you are just
such a fucking asshole.

194
00:11:53,899 --> 00:11:55,365
Don't you come
stepping into my life

195
00:11:55,367 --> 00:11:58,234
and telling me that
you care about my son.

196
00:11:58,236 --> 00:12:00,570
Hey, "our" son.

197
00:12:00,571 --> 00:12:02,905
Tony, voice-over:
Dig. Like last new year's night,

198
00:12:02,907 --> 00:12:05,974
when the whole scene
shown bright

199
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:10,044
and all the goons
was stalking their prey.

200
00:12:10,046 --> 00:12:12,946
The cold was pure crime
on them neon lights

201
00:12:12,948 --> 00:12:15,114
and all the tricks
were doomed to pay.

202
00:12:15,116 --> 00:12:19,118
Crime suddenly begun
soon as daughters made sons.

203
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:22,855
Some of them's
only 5 years old.

204
00:12:22,857 --> 00:12:25,141
You know, there's been
many, many a night

205
00:12:25,142 --> 00:12:27,426
I had to settle for
a bite off of some old...

206
00:12:27,428 --> 00:12:29,795
Moldy roll.

207
00:12:36,236 --> 00:12:37,835
Seen your father lately?

208
00:12:37,837 --> 00:12:40,237
He's dead.

209
00:12:41,106 --> 00:12:43,206
He's dead? You sure?

210
00:12:43,208 --> 00:12:45,508
Yeah, I'm sure.

211
00:12:47,144 --> 00:12:49,711
Positive?

212
00:12:49,712 --> 00:12:52,279
Absolutely.
Absolutely positive.

213
00:12:57,987 --> 00:13:00,454
A fucking deadbeat.

214
00:13:00,456 --> 00:13:04,157
A fucking prick is what he was.

215
00:13:16,170 --> 00:13:17,269
Are you hungry? You want to go

216
00:13:17,271 --> 00:13:18,870
get a slice of pizza
or something?

217
00:13:18,872 --> 00:13:21,439
Come on. Take a walk with me.

218
00:13:21,441 --> 00:13:22,840
I'll buy you a slice,
all right?

219
00:13:22,842 --> 00:13:25,175
That's all right. I'm good.

220
00:13:25,977 --> 00:13:27,810
Like you got something
better to do?

221
00:13:27,812 --> 00:13:31,913
Come on. Take a walk
with me, bro.

222
00:13:32,849 --> 00:13:36,083
Ok. But don't call me that.

223
00:13:42,390 --> 00:13:43,856
What can I do you fellas?

224
00:13:43,858 --> 00:13:45,224
Let me get two slices
and a coke.

225
00:13:45,226 --> 00:13:46,992
What you want to drink, bro?

226
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,160
Dr. Pepper.

227
00:13:48,161 --> 00:13:49,327
Dr. Pepper? You need something

228
00:13:49,329 --> 00:13:50,494
with vitamin c, yo.

229
00:13:50,496 --> 00:13:52,295
Hey, let me get
an orange drink with that.

230
00:13:52,297 --> 00:13:53,963
Man: 10 minutes on the pizza.

231
00:13:53,965 --> 00:13:55,797
Yeah. No problem.

232
00:13:58,835 --> 00:13:59,533
What?

233
00:13:59,535 --> 00:14:02,002
Look at you.

234
00:14:02,004 --> 00:14:03,837
Wipe your nose.

235
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:04,838
Thanks.

236
00:14:04,840 --> 00:14:06,339
You know you got to eat, bro.

237
00:14:06,341 --> 00:14:08,274
Feed a cold, starve a fever.

238
00:14:08,276 --> 00:14:09,975
That's what they say.

239
00:14:09,977 --> 00:14:12,410
I fucking told you
not to call me that.

240
00:14:12,412 --> 00:14:15,212
Now, see, look what you did.

241
00:14:15,214 --> 00:14:17,280
Are you stupid or what?

242
00:14:17,282 --> 00:14:19,415
Why the fuck you got
to talk to me like that?

243
00:14:19,417 --> 00:14:21,817
You put me back
another 10 minutes.

244
00:14:21,819 --> 00:14:23,041
I'm sorry.

245
00:14:23,042 --> 00:14:24,264
Yeah, sorry.
It does nothing for me.

246
00:14:24,265 --> 00:14:25,487
"You're sorry."
You know what? Get out.

247
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:26,821
What? We just want
some pizza, man.

248
00:14:26,823 --> 00:14:28,522
Oh, get a fucking haircut.

249
00:14:28,524 --> 00:14:30,957
Two of you are knuckleheads.

250
00:14:31,492 --> 00:14:33,425
Aah! What the fuck!

251
00:14:33,427 --> 00:14:34,492
Fuck, man!

252
00:14:34,494 --> 00:14:37,127
Torch: Say it
to my fucking face.

253
00:14:37,429 --> 00:14:40,596
Who's stupid now, motherfucker?

254
00:14:40,598 --> 00:14:42,264
Wait a minute. We got to go.

255
00:14:42,266 --> 00:14:43,565
We got to go.
The cops are coming.

256
00:14:43,567 --> 00:14:45,099
What are you talking about?

257
00:14:45,101 --> 00:14:46,584
What cops?

258
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:48,068
The ones behind me, yo.

259
00:14:48,603 --> 00:14:50,603
Holy shit.

260
00:14:52,306 --> 00:14:55,324
Officers: Hold it!
Hold it! Police!

261
00:14:55,325 --> 00:14:58,343
Stop right there!
Police officer! Stop!

262
00:15:07,287 --> 00:15:09,954
Get the fuck out of the way!

263
00:15:15,594 --> 00:15:18,294
Torch: Wait up, man. Wait up.

264
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:25,366
How did you know
those cops were coming?

265
00:15:25,368 --> 00:15:27,101
I got eyes in the back
of my head.

266
00:15:27,103 --> 00:15:29,503
20/20 Mike. That's me.

267
00:15:29,505 --> 00:15:30,487
What's the matter with you?

268
00:15:30,488 --> 00:15:31,470
What? Are you fucking crazy?

269
00:15:31,473 --> 00:15:32,538
You're trying to
get us busted again?

270
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:34,106
We just got out, man.

271
00:15:34,108 --> 00:15:36,341
Yeah, well, I may be crazy,

272
00:15:36,343 --> 00:15:37,375
but I ain't stupid.

273
00:15:37,376 --> 00:15:38,408
What do you mean
"we" just got out?

274
00:15:38,411 --> 00:15:39,421
We ain't together.

275
00:15:39,422 --> 00:15:40,432
Come on. Don't be
like that, bro.

276
00:15:40,433 --> 00:15:41,443
Don't fucking call me that.

277
00:15:41,447 --> 00:15:42,412
Just because my old man

278
00:15:42,414 --> 00:15:43,413
was fucking your mother

279
00:15:43,415 --> 00:15:44,580
don't make us brothers.

280
00:15:44,582 --> 00:15:45,792
Oh, wait a minute.

281
00:15:45,793 --> 00:15:47,003
Why you got to talk
about my mother, huh?

282
00:15:47,004 --> 00:15:48,214
Why you got to talk
about my mom?

283
00:15:48,218 --> 00:15:49,250
Ha ha ha!

284
00:15:49,252 --> 00:15:50,351
Fucking asshole.

285
00:15:50,352 --> 00:15:51,451
You fucking put
your hands up to me again,

286
00:15:51,452 --> 00:15:52,551
I'll throw you
a fucking beating

287
00:15:52,555 --> 00:15:53,921
you'll never forget.

288
00:15:53,923 --> 00:15:55,522
I'm sorry, all right?

289
00:15:55,524 --> 00:15:56,523
Look. You're pretty good

290
00:15:56,525 --> 00:15:57,657
with the smitties, right?

291
00:15:57,659 --> 00:16:00,459
Maybe we could make
some money together.

292
00:16:00,461 --> 00:16:01,426
Doing what?

293
00:16:01,428 --> 00:16:02,927
This and that. A little flim,

294
00:16:02,929 --> 00:16:05,429
a little flam, you know.

295
00:16:06,298 --> 00:16:07,397
I don't know.

296
00:16:07,399 --> 00:16:08,609
What? Like you got

297
00:16:08,610 --> 00:16:09,820
something better
to do, Mr. Williams?

298
00:16:09,821 --> 00:16:11,031
Cut me a break with
that Mr. Williams shit.

299
00:16:11,035 --> 00:16:13,201
Ok. Whatever the
fuck your name is.

300
00:16:13,203 --> 00:16:14,435
Billy.

301
00:16:14,437 --> 00:16:15,636
Billy?

302
00:16:15,638 --> 00:16:17,504
Yeah. Billy.

303
00:16:17,506 --> 00:16:21,007
You want to make
some money or not?

304
00:16:23,011 --> 00:16:25,244
Ok.

305
00:16:43,997 --> 00:16:46,097
What you want from me, Max?

306
00:16:46,099 --> 00:16:47,265
You know what I want?

307
00:16:47,266 --> 00:16:48,432
I want you to do what
you fucking promised.

308
00:16:48,434 --> 00:16:49,599
It's not that
fucking complicated.

309
00:16:49,601 --> 00:16:51,100
You say you're going
to do something,

310
00:16:51,102 --> 00:16:51,967
you do it.

311
00:16:51,969 --> 00:16:52,634
It's not my fault.

312
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:54,535
Whose fault is it? Mine?

313
00:16:54,537 --> 00:16:55,502
No.

314
00:16:55,504 --> 00:16:57,203
And I bet you won't tell her

315
00:16:57,205 --> 00:16:59,138
you won't take her
trick-or-treating.

316
00:16:59,140 --> 00:17:00,072
Maxine!

317
00:17:00,074 --> 00:17:02,507
Maxine what?

318
00:17:02,509 --> 00:17:04,342
I knew this shit
was going to happen.

319
00:17:04,344 --> 00:17:05,344
It's the same fucking shit

320
00:17:05,345 --> 00:17:06,828
that happened last year.

321
00:17:06,829 --> 00:17:08,312
Look. I got business
to take care of.

322
00:17:08,314 --> 00:17:10,380
You're going to have to
take her this year.

323
00:17:10,382 --> 00:17:11,731
You know what?

324
00:17:11,732 --> 00:17:13,081
She doesn't
want me to take her.

325
00:17:13,084 --> 00:17:14,416
She wants her father
to take her.

326
00:17:14,418 --> 00:17:16,418
All right? She's a little girl.

327
00:17:16,420 --> 00:17:18,386
Halloween is important to her.

328
00:17:18,388 --> 00:17:19,620
I know that.

329
00:17:19,622 --> 00:17:20,687
Think I don't know that?

330
00:17:20,689 --> 00:17:23,156
Why don't you
fucking act like it?

331
00:17:23,158 --> 00:17:25,625
She's not going to
be little forever.

332
00:17:25,627 --> 00:17:26,626
Where you going?

333
00:17:26,628 --> 00:17:28,128
Where you going?

334
00:17:28,129 --> 00:17:29,629
Going to pick her up
from school.

335
00:17:29,631 --> 00:17:31,197
This is bullshit!

336
00:17:31,199 --> 00:17:33,665
Now just stop it, all right?

337
00:17:36,670 --> 00:17:41,706
Max... You know the game.

338
00:17:46,412 --> 00:17:48,111
I'll be back.

339
00:17:48,113 --> 00:17:51,280
I'll be back as soon as I can.

340
00:17:59,022 --> 00:18:03,057
Just do what you got to do.

341
00:18:05,561 --> 00:18:08,361
Come here. Don't be scared.

342
00:18:08,363 --> 00:18:09,729
It'll be ok.

343
00:18:09,731 --> 00:18:12,164
You go get precious.

344
00:18:12,166 --> 00:18:15,000
Tell her daddy's sorry.

345
00:18:15,002 --> 00:18:17,068
Will you do that for me?

346
00:18:18,204 --> 00:18:20,270
Yeah.

347
00:18:26,677 --> 00:18:28,594
I'll do that for you.

348
00:18:28,595 --> 00:18:30,512
I'll tell her you're sorry.

349
00:18:37,186 --> 00:18:38,318
Maxine: I don't know why

350
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:42,121
I'm with your sorry ass anyway.

351
00:18:43,157 --> 00:18:44,623
Tony, voice-over:
Wayward daughters

352
00:18:44,625 --> 00:18:45,624
for dollars and quarters

353
00:18:45,626 --> 00:18:48,727
would sell
their youthful selves,

354
00:18:48,729 --> 00:18:51,429
and in the morning they awoke

355
00:18:51,431 --> 00:18:54,565
to find their hearts
near broke,

356
00:18:54,567 --> 00:18:57,334
crying themselves to death.

357
00:19:01,340 --> 00:19:03,740
While junkies prowl
with a tiger's growl

358
00:19:03,742 --> 00:19:06,375
in search of their
much needed blow,

359
00:19:06,377 --> 00:19:09,311
and winos cringe
on their canned heat bins

360
00:19:09,313 --> 00:19:12,647
to find their graves
in the snow.

361
00:19:12,649 --> 00:19:16,217
Where belles of vice
sell love for a price

362
00:19:16,219 --> 00:19:19,587
and even the law gets corrupt,

363
00:19:19,589 --> 00:19:21,622
man, you keep on trying.

364
00:19:21,624 --> 00:19:28,595
But nevertheless crime,
like gin... what a bitter cup.

365
00:19:28,597 --> 00:19:31,264
The jungle creed says,

366
00:19:31,266 --> 00:19:35,601
"the strongest feed
off of any prey at hand,"

367
00:19:35,603 --> 00:19:39,738
and I was branded "beast"
at every feast,

368
00:19:39,740 --> 00:19:43,274
before I ever became a man.

369
00:20:19,744 --> 00:20:21,710
They're here.

370
00:20:21,712 --> 00:20:22,744
You sure?

371
00:20:22,745 --> 00:20:23,777
Yeah, I'm sure. Positive?

372
00:20:23,780 --> 00:20:25,212
Absolutely.
Absolutely positive.

373
00:20:25,214 --> 00:20:27,847
Go upstairs. Wait for my call.

374
00:21:28,809 --> 00:21:31,676
Man on TV: Hey, all right!

375
00:21:31,678 --> 00:21:32,843
I'm here. You're here.

376
00:21:32,845 --> 00:21:34,778
We're all here together.

377
00:21:34,779 --> 00:21:36,712
Do you have any idea
what we're doing here?

378
00:21:36,715 --> 00:21:39,682
Hey, Michael. You know?

379
00:21:39,684 --> 00:21:41,717
All right! That's what
we're going to do!

380
00:21:43,020 --> 00:21:44,753
Hi, Catherine. Hi, bill.

381
00:21:44,755 --> 00:21:47,622
Bill: How are you today?
Are you hungry?

382
00:21:47,624 --> 00:21:49,457
Happy Halloween, fellas.

383
00:21:49,459 --> 00:21:50,424
Trick or treat.

384
00:21:50,426 --> 00:21:52,359
Hey, come on, man!

385
00:21:52,361 --> 00:21:54,627
You think I'm
fucking stupid, b?

386
00:21:54,629 --> 00:21:57,329
Fuck. This is the kid
from the elevator.

387
00:21:57,331 --> 00:21:59,331
Yo, where the fuck is Freddie?

388
00:21:59,333 --> 00:22:00,899
He's downstairs.
He's on lookout.

389
00:22:00,901 --> 00:22:02,400
Hey, man, I ain't
packing nothing.

390
00:22:02,402 --> 00:22:04,568
I ain't packing nothing, ok?

391
00:22:10,942 --> 00:22:14,076
How you doing?

392
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:18,379
Good. Yeah.

393
00:22:21,450 --> 00:22:22,615
Listen. You guys
want to show me

394
00:22:22,617 --> 00:22:24,083
the product or what?

395
00:22:24,085 --> 00:22:26,852
Hector: No doubt.

396
00:22:34,027 --> 00:22:35,359
<i>Esta bien.</i>

397
00:22:35,361 --> 00:22:36,660
Oh, so it's money time
though, right?

398
00:22:36,662 --> 00:22:38,662
It's money time. So why
don't you call your boy

399
00:22:38,664 --> 00:22:40,697
and we get this money
and we do this?

400
00:22:44,969 --> 00:22:45,934
Yeah?

401
00:22:45,936 --> 00:22:47,435
It's that time. You ready, bro?

402
00:22:47,437 --> 00:22:48,803
Don't fucking call me that.

403
00:22:48,805 --> 00:22:50,838
Well, come on up.
We're waiting.

404
00:22:50,840 --> 00:22:52,072
Keep your fucking
shirt on, Mikey.

405
00:22:52,074 --> 00:22:53,006
I'm coming, all right?

406
00:22:53,008 --> 00:22:53,940
Hurry up. These guys want

407
00:22:53,942 --> 00:22:56,776
their fucking money, all right?

408
00:23:01,616 --> 00:23:04,116
Yeah. Heard you
twice the first time.

409
00:23:08,621 --> 00:23:10,487
Damn!

410
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,626
Mike: So, fellas,
today's your lucky day.

411
00:23:16,628 --> 00:23:18,561
You're under arrest.

412
00:23:29,505 --> 00:23:30,770
Man: Give me the fucking...

413
00:23:34,508 --> 00:23:36,440
Oh, shit!

414
00:23:39,378 --> 00:23:41,010
Watch where the fuck
you're going, man.

415
00:23:41,012 --> 00:23:42,261
I'm sorry, yo.

416
00:23:42,262 --> 00:23:43,511
What are you
doing here, Freddie?

417
00:23:43,514 --> 00:23:44,646
Nothing.

418
00:23:44,648 --> 00:23:45,847
I didn't recognize you.

419
00:23:45,849 --> 00:23:47,448
How you doing?

420
00:23:47,450 --> 00:23:48,148
Manny send you?

421
00:23:48,150 --> 00:23:50,483
Yeah. No. I mean no.

422
00:23:50,485 --> 00:23:52,485
I was just... what?

423
00:23:52,487 --> 00:23:53,820
Ow! Aah!

424
00:23:53,821 --> 00:23:55,154
Easy, man.
Why you bugging, dude?

425
00:23:55,156 --> 00:23:56,455
Aah! What the fuck?

426
00:23:56,457 --> 00:23:59,090
You're coming with me,
motherfucker.

427
00:24:01,461 --> 00:24:04,427
What the fuck, man?

428
00:24:07,765 --> 00:24:10,966
What's your
fucking problem, man?

429
00:24:10,968 --> 00:24:12,834
Hey, yo!

430
00:24:17,740 --> 00:24:19,039
Bill on TV: Ooh, boy.

431
00:24:19,041 --> 00:24:21,508
Hey, Michael, can you
smell the aromas?

432
00:24:21,510 --> 00:24:25,078
Boy, these guys know how
to play along real well...

433
00:24:50,605 --> 00:24:51,704
You sure this is where

434
00:24:51,706 --> 00:24:52,938
we're supposed to meet them?

435
00:24:52,940 --> 00:24:54,072
Yeah, I'm sure.

436
00:24:55,542 --> 00:24:56,841
You positive?

437
00:24:56,843 --> 00:25:00,477
Absolutely.
Absolutely positive.

438
00:25:00,679 --> 00:25:03,646
Yeah. We can't wait
here all night.

439
00:25:03,648 --> 00:25:06,582
Yeah. Tell me about it.

440
00:25:10,487 --> 00:25:11,919
Who you calling?

441
00:25:11,921 --> 00:25:14,087
A friend of mine.

442
00:25:16,958 --> 00:25:17,723
Hello.

443
00:25:17,725 --> 00:25:18,623
Mike: Trick or treat.

444
00:25:18,625 --> 00:25:19,724
Precious, how you doing?

445
00:25:19,726 --> 00:25:21,459
Hello. Go put your costume on.

446
00:25:21,461 --> 00:25:22,126
Hey.

447
00:25:22,128 --> 00:25:22,926
Who's this?

448
00:25:22,928 --> 00:25:24,694
Hey, Max. It's Mike.

449
00:25:24,696 --> 00:25:26,095
Oh, shit.

450
00:25:26,097 --> 00:25:27,930
Aw, damn, she got so big.

451
00:25:27,932 --> 00:25:29,498
What do you want, Michael?

452
00:25:29,500 --> 00:25:30,699
How you doing, Max?

453
00:25:30,701 --> 00:25:32,967
Oh, I'm fine. Yeah. Mm-hmm.

454
00:25:32,969 --> 00:25:33,867
What do you want?

455
00:25:33,869 --> 00:25:34,851
Let me talk to Tony.

456
00:25:34,852 --> 00:25:35,834
Let me talk to Tony.

457
00:25:35,837 --> 00:25:37,270
Well, Tony's not here.

458
00:25:37,271 --> 00:25:38,704
Listen, can you tell him
to meet me later tonight?

459
00:25:38,706 --> 00:25:40,672
Maxine: Well, Tony's
taking care of business,

460
00:25:40,674 --> 00:25:42,140
and I don't know
where to reach him.

461
00:25:42,142 --> 00:25:43,642
Max, please, Max.

462
00:25:43,643 --> 00:25:45,143
I'm in trouble now, all right?

463
00:25:45,144 --> 00:25:46,644
That's the fucking problem.
You always in trouble.

464
00:25:46,646 --> 00:25:48,646
That's the only time
we ever hear from you.

465
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:50,547
I know, Max,
and I'm sorry. I just...

466
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:53,483
you just what?
You in jail again?

467
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:55,785
No. No, it's just...

468
00:25:55,787 --> 00:25:57,486
It's my sister.

469
00:25:58,055 --> 00:25:59,555
Debbie?

470
00:25:59,556 --> 00:26:01,056
Yeah. She's shooting
dope again,

471
00:26:01,057 --> 00:26:02,557
and listen, can you
tell Tony to meet me

472
00:26:02,559 --> 00:26:03,624
at the old spot tonight?

473
00:26:03,626 --> 00:26:05,759
Help me look for her maybe?

474
00:26:05,761 --> 00:26:07,978
Please.

475
00:26:07,979 --> 00:26:10,196
Yeah, all right.
I'll tell him you called.

476
00:26:10,198 --> 00:26:12,598
Thanks, Max.

477
00:26:14,101 --> 00:26:16,534
Yeah. Give precious
a big hug for me, all right?

478
00:26:16,536 --> 00:26:20,771
Operator: If you need help,
hang up and then dial...

479
00:26:21,206 --> 00:26:23,639

480
00:26:23,641 --> 00:26:25,758
Never mind.

481
00:26:25,759 --> 00:26:27,876

Ok, ok, ok. You made it, Mikey.

508
00:27:54,046 --> 00:27:55,745
You made it.

509
00:27:55,747 --> 00:27:57,113
Ha ha! Ha ha ha!

510
00:27:57,115 --> 00:27:59,782
Hey, we made it.

511
00:28:00,651 --> 00:28:05,653
All you got to do
is calm the fuck down.

512
00:28:05,655 --> 00:28:06,320
Think, baby.

513
00:28:06,322 --> 00:28:09,256
You just got to think.

514
00:28:09,258 --> 00:28:12,025
Yo, Billy, where the fuck
are you? Hurry up.

515
00:28:12,027 --> 00:28:12,959
I'm coming. I'm coming.

516
00:28:12,961 --> 00:28:13,961
Keep your shirt on, Mike.

517
00:28:13,962 --> 00:28:17,263
It's fucking dark up here.

518
00:28:23,370 --> 00:28:25,870
You almost there.

519
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:27,371
You can make it, bro.

520
00:28:27,373 --> 00:28:30,173
I told you not to call me that.

521
00:28:30,175 --> 00:28:32,376
You sure we're
going to be safe up here?

522
00:28:32,378 --> 00:28:34,811
Yeah, I'm sure.

523
00:28:39,350 --> 00:28:42,884
Torch: Huh? Oh, shit.
This is it?

524
00:28:42,886 --> 00:28:44,852
This is your fucking hideout?

525
00:28:44,854 --> 00:28:46,153
Yeah, yeah, this is it.

526
00:28:46,155 --> 00:28:48,889
Go ahead. Make
yourself at home.

527
00:28:48,891 --> 00:28:51,892
You sure Manny won't
come looking for us here?

528
00:28:51,894 --> 00:28:52,726
Yeah, I'm sure.

529
00:28:52,728 --> 00:28:53,893
You positive?

530
00:28:53,895 --> 00:28:55,261
I'm telling you, absolutely.

531
00:28:55,263 --> 00:28:57,496
Absolutely positive.

532
00:28:57,498 --> 00:28:58,586
Let me tell you something.

533
00:28:58,587 --> 00:28:59,675
It looks like
quite a few people found

534
00:28:59,676 --> 00:29:00,764
your little
fucking hideaway here.

535
00:29:00,767 --> 00:29:03,434
Will you just go ahead
and sit down?

536
00:29:04,236 --> 00:29:07,904
Yeah, yeah. I'll do that.

537
00:29:09,073 --> 00:29:10,739
Let me tell you something else.

538
00:29:10,740 --> 00:29:12,406
I sure as shit ain't taking
my shoes off in this joint.

539
00:29:12,409 --> 00:29:14,742
God forbid, I get fucking aids.

540
00:29:14,744 --> 00:29:17,878
What are you so fucking
worried about, huh?

541
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:18,962
I don't know.

542
00:29:18,963 --> 00:29:20,045
What if Manny
and his boys find us?

543
00:29:20,048 --> 00:29:21,280
What about that, huh?

544
00:29:21,282 --> 00:29:23,081
<i>Mierda,</i> look it, I told you.

545
00:29:23,083 --> 00:29:26,350
This place is like
fucking fort knox.

546
00:29:26,352 --> 00:29:27,517
Nobody comes in our out

547
00:29:27,519 --> 00:29:29,202
unless they know the way.

548
00:29:29,203 --> 00:29:30,886
All right? Me and my man Tony,

549
00:29:30,889 --> 00:29:32,255
we used to hide out
here all the time.

550
00:29:32,257 --> 00:29:34,824
What you keep saying.
Are you sure nobody saw us?

551
00:29:34,826 --> 00:29:38,260
Yeah. Yeah.

552
00:29:41,832 --> 00:29:43,832
Jesus Christ. Damn
place is a mess.

553
00:29:43,834 --> 00:29:45,400
No shit.

554
00:29:45,902 --> 00:29:47,067
I don't know if I like this.

555
00:29:47,069 --> 00:29:48,151
I think we should blow.

556
00:29:48,152 --> 00:29:49,234
I think we should get
the fuck out of here.

557
00:29:49,237 --> 00:29:50,670
And do what? What,
you want to ride

558
00:29:50,671 --> 00:29:52,104
the fucking subway
till somebody spots us?

559
00:29:52,106 --> 00:29:53,171
No. We take our chances
on the street.

560
00:29:53,173 --> 00:29:54,522
We're better off.
I'm telling you.

561
00:29:54,523 --> 00:29:55,872
No. Forget about it.
We got half the dealers

562
00:29:55,875 --> 00:29:57,174
in the city looking
for us probably,

563
00:29:57,176 --> 00:29:58,108
not to mention the cops.

564
00:29:58,109 --> 00:29:59,041
We got to do some
fucking thing.

565
00:29:59,044 --> 00:30:00,043
At least get out of New York.

566
00:30:00,045 --> 00:30:02,512
To Jersey, Philly, maybe Miami.

567
00:30:02,514 --> 00:30:04,046
I hear the weather's nice.

568
00:30:04,048 --> 00:30:05,464
Miami?

569
00:30:05,465 --> 00:30:06,881
Miami? What are
you, fucking crazy?

570
00:30:06,884 --> 00:30:08,817
Manny's got connections
up the ass

571
00:30:08,819 --> 00:30:09,484
on the east coast.

572
00:30:09,486 --> 00:30:11,118
We got to go out west.

573
00:30:11,120 --> 00:30:12,519
California, Seattle, maybe.

574
00:30:12,521 --> 00:30:14,787
Maybe this guy Tony,
the friend you called,

575
00:30:14,789 --> 00:30:16,522
maybe we could sell
the shit to him.

576
00:30:16,524 --> 00:30:18,123
No way. No way.

577
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:19,791
Tony's out of the life now.

578
00:30:19,793 --> 00:30:21,125
Let me tell you something.

579
00:30:21,127 --> 00:30:22,392
Once you got a taste
of the life, that's it.

580
00:30:22,394 --> 00:30:24,961
Once in the life,
always in the life, Mikey.

581
00:30:24,963 --> 00:30:28,197
Not my man Tony, man. He's out.

582
00:30:28,199 --> 00:30:30,399
Lucky motherfucker.

583
00:30:31,835 --> 00:30:33,835
Oh, we used to come
up here all the time

584
00:30:33,837 --> 00:30:35,002
back in the day.

585
00:30:35,004 --> 00:30:36,470
Me, him, fucking Freddie.

586
00:30:36,472 --> 00:30:38,405
Fucking Freddie nine lives.

587
00:30:38,407 --> 00:30:39,773
A piece of work, he is.

588
00:30:39,774 --> 00:30:41,140
Catch that motherfucker,
throw him off a roof.

589
00:30:41,143 --> 00:30:43,409
Freddie: Aah!
I don't know nothing.

590
00:30:43,411 --> 00:30:44,543
I don't know nothing.

591
00:30:44,545 --> 00:30:46,378
I swear I don't know anything.

592
00:30:46,380 --> 00:30:47,812
I swear to God, please!

593
00:30:47,814 --> 00:30:50,347
Come on, Freddie, who was it?

594
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:51,838
Come on.

595
00:30:51,839 --> 00:30:53,328
Freddie: I don't know
nothing, man. I swear to God.

596
00:30:53,329 --> 00:30:54,818
You don't tell me,
I'm going to throw you

597
00:30:54,820 --> 00:30:56,586
off this fucking roof. Tell me.

598
00:30:56,588 --> 00:30:58,921
Please, Manny, please.
I don't know anything.

599
00:30:58,923 --> 00:31:01,457
Oh, God, no!

600
00:31:01,458 --> 00:31:03,992
Hey, Buddha, don't cats
usually land on their feet?

601
00:31:03,994 --> 00:31:06,027
Yeah, but at this
height, I don't know.

602
00:31:06,029 --> 00:31:09,230
No, Manny, please.
Don't drop me, Manny.

603
00:31:09,232 --> 00:31:11,865
Don't kill me. Not like
this, Manny, please.

604
00:31:11,867 --> 00:31:12,832
Drop him.

605
00:31:12,834 --> 00:31:14,366
No! No! No!

606
00:31:14,368 --> 00:31:15,617
It was Mike!

607
00:31:15,618 --> 00:31:16,867
It was Mike, 20/20 Mike!

608
00:31:16,870 --> 00:31:18,502
Come on, Freddie,
stop fucking around.

609
00:31:18,504 --> 00:31:20,136
Come on. The other guy, huh?

610
00:31:20,138 --> 00:31:22,571
It was some crazy white boy
with long hair,

611
00:31:22,573 --> 00:31:23,806
a dope fiend.

612
00:31:23,807 --> 00:31:25,040
I swear that's all
I know, Manny.

613
00:31:25,042 --> 00:31:28,310
Oh, my God, don't...

614
00:31:28,311 --> 00:31:31,579
20/20. Ain't that Tony's boy?

615
00:31:31,948 --> 00:31:35,249
Yo, Manny. I ain't seen
this cat in, like, years,

616
00:31:35,251 --> 00:31:36,850
you know what I'm saying?

617
00:31:36,852 --> 00:31:38,918
Freddie: I swear.
Don't drop me.

618
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,020
I swear to God! Please.

619
00:31:41,022 --> 00:31:42,554
It's ok, Tony.

620
00:31:42,556 --> 00:31:44,056
Really, it's ok.

621
00:31:44,057 --> 00:31:45,557
Freddie: Oh, my God,
don't kill me, Manny.

622
00:31:45,559 --> 00:31:46,624
Please, not like this!

623
00:31:46,626 --> 00:31:48,626
Ruffhouse, Buddha,

624
00:31:48,628 --> 00:31:50,027
why don't you take
Freddie downstairs

625
00:31:50,029 --> 00:31:50,994
and hang out, huh?

626
00:31:50,996 --> 00:31:52,628
Me and Tony got to talk.

627
00:31:52,630 --> 00:31:54,596
I can't believe he fucking
left us hanging, man.

628
00:31:54,598 --> 00:31:56,197
Cocksucker said the job
would be a cinch.

629
00:31:56,199 --> 00:31:57,498
Said it would be easy.
Now look at us

630
00:31:57,500 --> 00:31:59,266
sitting here
in a fucking firetrap.

631
00:31:59,268 --> 00:32:00,250
It would have been a cinch

632
00:32:00,251 --> 00:32:01,233
if you'd have chilled
the fuck out.

633
00:32:01,236 --> 00:32:02,335
Don't fucking start with me.

634
00:32:02,336 --> 00:32:03,435
I can't believe you
fucking shot those guys.

635
00:32:03,436 --> 00:32:04,535
How many fucking times
are you going to say it?

636
00:32:04,539 --> 00:32:06,005
You fucking shot two kids, man.

637
00:32:06,007 --> 00:32:06,872
I can't believe that.

638
00:32:06,874 --> 00:32:08,039
Forget about it, will you?

639
00:32:08,041 --> 00:32:10,440
What's done is done.

640
00:32:12,544 --> 00:32:13,576
Yeah.

641
00:32:13,577 --> 00:32:14,609
You came to me
about a year ago.

642
00:32:14,612 --> 00:32:15,911
You asked
for your own franchise.

643
00:32:15,913 --> 00:32:17,612
I gave it to you,
and what happens?

644
00:32:17,614 --> 00:32:19,880
Is this how you show
your fucking appreciation?

645
00:32:19,882 --> 00:32:20,914
Manny, you got to believe...

646
00:32:20,916 --> 00:32:21,881
shut the fuck up!

647
00:32:21,883 --> 00:32:23,649
Just keep on talking.

648
00:32:23,651 --> 00:32:25,117
Keep on talking.

649
00:32:25,119 --> 00:32:27,652
Freddie: Don't hit me... ohh!

650
00:32:28,955 --> 00:32:31,121
Now, I know this motherfucker

651
00:32:31,123 --> 00:32:32,388
set me up.

652
00:32:32,390 --> 00:32:34,623
Now, I know he's
responsible for Hector.

653
00:32:34,625 --> 00:32:36,592
All I want to know is

654
00:32:36,593 --> 00:32:38,560
when, where, why, what, who.

655
00:32:38,562 --> 00:32:40,112
Come on.

656
00:32:40,113 --> 00:32:41,663
I got to the hotel, all right?

657
00:32:51,006 --> 00:32:52,438
Yeah.

658
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,606
Yeah, baby.

659
00:32:54,608 --> 00:32:56,124
No.

660
00:32:56,125 --> 00:32:57,641
Look, Max, I'm kind of
tied up right now, ok?

661
00:32:57,644 --> 00:32:58,609
How's your hand, bro?

662
00:32:58,611 --> 00:32:59,977
Stop calling me that.

663
00:32:59,979 --> 00:33:01,411
I ain't your brother.

664
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:02,345
So it's like that now?

665
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:04,680
You bet your ass it is.

666
00:33:04,682 --> 00:33:06,515
You're a sick man,
Mr. Williams.

667
00:33:06,517 --> 00:33:07,649
I told you not to call me that.

668
00:33:07,651 --> 00:33:10,351
Yep. You're a very sick man.

669
00:33:10,353 --> 00:33:12,152
I'm not sick.

670
00:33:12,154 --> 00:33:14,037
Just got a cold,

671
00:33:14,038 --> 00:33:15,921
and my fucking
hand's killing me.

672
00:33:17,025 --> 00:33:19,191
Come on, Tony.
Where the fuck are you?

673
00:33:19,193 --> 00:33:21,927
I think I know where
they are, Manny.

674
00:33:21,929 --> 00:33:23,128
That's good, Tony.

675
00:33:23,130 --> 00:33:24,229
Now we're going to talk about

676
00:33:24,231 --> 00:33:26,598
how you should handle it.

677
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:27,498
Me?

678
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:28,932
Yeah, you.

679
00:33:28,934 --> 00:33:30,533
I can't do that, man.

680
00:33:30,535 --> 00:33:32,285
Why is that?

681
00:33:32,286 --> 00:33:34,036
I ain't never killed
nobody before, man.

682
00:33:34,038 --> 00:33:35,738
Well, guess what, Tony.

683
00:33:35,739 --> 00:33:37,439
There's a first time
for everything.

684
00:33:38,542 --> 00:33:40,275
What?

685
00:33:40,510 --> 00:33:43,344
It's your product
we're talking about here.

686
00:33:43,346 --> 00:33:44,545
It's your responsibility.

687
00:33:44,547 --> 00:33:48,549
You wanted to be
your own boss, right?

688
00:33:48,551 --> 00:33:51,468
Guess what.

689
00:33:51,469 --> 00:33:54,386
You got to pay the cost
if you want to be the boss.

690
00:33:56,958 --> 00:33:59,525
You take that with you.

691
00:34:01,428 --> 00:34:03,015
Fuck this sitting around

692
00:34:03,016 --> 00:34:04,603
waiting for your friend
to show up.

693
00:34:04,604 --> 00:34:06,191
God forbid, Manny
and his boys find us.

694
00:34:06,192 --> 00:34:07,779
Forget it. They'll fucking
have us for breakfast.

695
00:34:07,780 --> 00:34:09,367
Hold up. Hold up.
What the fuck is that?

696
00:34:09,369 --> 00:34:10,368
What?

697
00:34:10,370 --> 00:34:11,469
Listen.

698
00:34:11,471 --> 00:34:12,437
What the fuck is that?

699
00:34:12,438 --> 00:34:13,404
I don't know.
Maybe it's your friend.

700
00:34:13,406 --> 00:34:14,372
No. That's something else.

701
00:34:14,373 --> 00:34:15,339
I know I've heard
that sound before.

702
00:34:15,341 --> 00:34:16,673
So what are you asking me for?

703
00:34:16,675 --> 00:34:17,640
I don't know...

704
00:34:17,642 --> 00:34:19,607
shh! Shh! Wait.

705
00:34:22,011 --> 00:34:23,076
Oh, shit!

706
00:34:23,078 --> 00:34:24,143
Fuck!

707
00:34:24,145 --> 00:34:25,410
That's a fucking rat, man.

708
00:34:25,412 --> 00:34:26,644
Don't do that shit, man!

709
00:34:26,646 --> 00:34:28,979
I'm telling you,
that's a fucking rat, man.

710
00:34:39,157 --> 00:34:40,489
I hate rats.

711
00:34:40,491 --> 00:34:42,390
I can't stand them shits.

712
00:34:42,392 --> 00:34:44,258
I remember I was
dating this girl.

713
00:34:44,260 --> 00:34:45,726
She lived down by mill basin...

714
00:34:45,728 --> 00:34:47,260
candy brown.

715
00:34:47,262 --> 00:34:48,261
Bitch was fine, bro.

716
00:34:48,263 --> 00:34:49,495
Told you not to call me...

717
00:34:49,497 --> 00:34:51,196
I mean, fine.

718
00:34:51,198 --> 00:34:52,630
This chick was so fine,
I spent all the bread

719
00:34:52,632 --> 00:34:53,631
I could get my hands on

720
00:34:53,633 --> 00:34:55,433
trying to get into her panties.

721
00:34:55,434 --> 00:34:57,234
Took her to coney island,
the aquarium, the movies.

722
00:34:57,236 --> 00:34:58,668
Any place in Brooklyn
I thought she might give it up,

723
00:34:58,670 --> 00:35:00,770
that's where I
would take her, right?

724
00:35:00,772 --> 00:35:02,638
So after we had gone out
a few times...

725
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:04,406
I don't know to this date
how I knew,

726
00:35:04,408 --> 00:35:06,141
but I could tell
she had finally decided

727
00:35:06,143 --> 00:35:07,509
to give me some, right?

728
00:35:07,511 --> 00:35:09,611
So, we had gone to the movies

729
00:35:09,613 --> 00:35:11,530
over on church Avenue,

730
00:35:11,531 --> 00:35:13,448
and when the flick was over,
she asked me to walk her home,

731
00:35:13,450 --> 00:35:14,482
so I go like a bat.

732
00:35:14,484 --> 00:35:16,150
So, we start walking, talking,

733
00:35:16,152 --> 00:35:17,618
shooting the breeze, you know.

734
00:35:17,620 --> 00:35:19,152
And bing bing!

735
00:35:19,154 --> 00:35:21,420
My 20/20 start going off
like crazy.

736
00:35:21,422 --> 00:35:23,522
It was like I could feel
all the fellas around her way,

737
00:35:23,524 --> 00:35:24,656
they were checking
me out, you know,

738
00:35:24,658 --> 00:35:25,657
like, "who's this chump?

739
00:35:25,659 --> 00:35:27,659
What's she doing
with him," right?

740
00:35:27,661 --> 00:35:29,661
So, we finally get
to her building,

741
00:35:29,663 --> 00:35:31,163
and it's all run-down and shit.

742
00:35:31,164 --> 00:35:32,664
I'm like, "what the fuck
is a chick this fine

743
00:35:32,666 --> 00:35:34,566
doing living in a place
like this?"

744
00:35:34,567 --> 00:35:36,467
<i>Mierda,</i> she was fine as wine.
I'm telling you,

745
00:35:36,469 --> 00:35:37,568
dress her up in garbage bags,

746
00:35:37,569 --> 00:35:38,668
put fucking TV dinners
on her head,

747
00:35:38,671 --> 00:35:40,554
you could not hide
this kind of beauty,

748
00:35:40,555 --> 00:35:42,438
and after I'd taken
her out all them times?

749
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,508
Said I was going to
get these panties.

750
00:35:44,509 --> 00:35:46,576
I mean, I was very serious
about this pussy, ok?

751
00:35:46,578 --> 00:35:48,711
Is there a point to this story?

752
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,647
Oh, yeah, check it out,
I forgot.

753
00:35:50,649 --> 00:35:54,717
We had stopped to get some
bacardi on the way, right?

754
00:35:54,719 --> 00:35:57,753
When we get to her apartment
on the fourth floor,

755
00:35:57,755 --> 00:35:58,820
that shit was hooked up.

756
00:35:58,822 --> 00:36:01,189
Top to bottom,
all exotic and whatnot.

757
00:36:01,191 --> 00:36:04,158
The bitch got beads hanging
over the bedroom door,

758
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,592
different colored
light bulbs in the ceiling,

759
00:36:05,594 --> 00:36:07,694
and pillows on the floor...
that type of shit.

760
00:36:07,696 --> 00:36:10,196
Yeah, she lit up a joint,
some incense,

761
00:36:10,198 --> 00:36:11,848
asked me to make some drinks

762
00:36:11,849 --> 00:36:13,499
while she goes
and gets comfortable.

763
00:36:16,904 --> 00:36:19,771
I made it. I made it
to mill basin alive.

764
00:36:19,773 --> 00:36:21,122
I'm going to fuck
the finest girl

765
00:36:21,123 --> 00:36:22,472
I ever seen in my life, right?

766
00:36:22,475 --> 00:36:24,708
So, I make the drinks.

767
00:36:24,710 --> 00:36:26,609
One for me, right?

768
00:36:26,611 --> 00:36:28,544
One for her.

769
00:36:28,546 --> 00:36:30,412
I'm sitting on the floor.

770
00:36:30,414 --> 00:36:32,213
I'm sipping my drink.
I'm taking it all in, right?

771
00:36:32,215 --> 00:36:34,915
The lights, the reefer,
the incense...

772
00:36:34,917 --> 00:36:36,650
bling bing bing!

773
00:36:36,652 --> 00:36:38,718
My 20/20 goes off again, right?

774
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:41,587
It's like I could feel
something in the room.

775
00:36:41,589 --> 00:36:45,657
So, I go to put
my drink down, right?

776
00:36:45,659 --> 00:36:46,791
The shit spills over.

777
00:36:46,792 --> 00:36:47,924
Fucking floor was slanted, bro.

778
00:36:47,927 --> 00:36:49,493
No lie, the shit was like this.

779
00:36:49,495 --> 00:36:52,362
So, now I'm trying
to clean up my mess,

780
00:36:52,364 --> 00:36:53,663
and I hear
this scratching sound

781
00:36:53,665 --> 00:36:55,865
on the floor behind me.

782
00:36:55,867 --> 00:36:58,500
I turn around.

783
00:36:58,502 --> 00:37:00,085
I see this rat.

784
00:37:00,086 --> 00:37:01,669
Go on, yo, a fucking rat
this fucking big.

785
00:37:01,671 --> 00:37:03,771
Swear to God, it was
as big as your fucking head.

786
00:37:03,773 --> 00:37:06,540
Ahh, I can't stand them shits.

787
00:37:06,542 --> 00:37:07,841
I'm telling you, man,
that shit blew my mind.

788
00:37:07,843 --> 00:37:09,776
I mean, I couldn't
concentrate on nothing else

789
00:37:09,778 --> 00:37:12,745
for the whole rest
of the night.

790
00:37:12,913 --> 00:37:14,212
See, what happened was,
when I was little,

791
00:37:14,214 --> 00:37:15,646
my sister Debbie,
she got bit by a rat.

792
00:37:15,648 --> 00:37:18,682
She was only, what,
2 or 3 years old at the time.

793
00:37:18,684 --> 00:37:19,716
I didn't know it then,

794
00:37:19,717 --> 00:37:20,749
but I kept that shit locked up

795
00:37:20,752 --> 00:37:23,219
in the back of my mind.

796
00:37:23,487 --> 00:37:25,220
Like, in my subconscience,
you know?

797
00:37:25,222 --> 00:37:27,989
So when the chick
came out of the bathroom...

798
00:37:27,991 --> 00:37:29,474
I mean, all ready to go, man,

799
00:37:29,475 --> 00:37:30,958
looking finer than
a motherfucker...

800
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:35,295
pussy? Furthest thing
from my mind.

801
00:37:40,600 --> 00:37:43,901
About time, yo. Here he comes.

802
00:38:06,324 --> 00:38:07,456
We got to get out
of here, Mike.

803
00:38:07,457 --> 00:38:08,589
Shut up. I'm trying
to think of something.

804
00:38:08,592 --> 00:38:10,025
While you're doing that,
I'm bleeding

805
00:38:10,026 --> 00:38:11,459
like a stuck pig. I got
to take a piss...

806
00:38:11,461 --> 00:38:13,360
ow, ow, ow!

807
00:38:13,362 --> 00:38:14,561
You fuck!

808
00:38:14,563 --> 00:38:16,829
Tony: Yo, Mike.

809
00:38:20,401 --> 00:38:22,601
Yo, Mikey!

810
00:38:24,037 --> 00:38:25,803
Fuck.

811
00:38:39,718 --> 00:38:42,185
Yo, Mike.

812
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:44,653
Ok. I'm going to go
up on the roof.

813
00:38:44,656 --> 00:38:45,688
I'm coming with you.

814
00:38:45,689 --> 00:38:46,721
No way you're
leaving me by myself.

815
00:38:46,724 --> 00:38:48,173
No. You move around too much,

816
00:38:48,174 --> 00:38:49,623
you'll only make
yourself bleed more.

817
00:38:49,626 --> 00:38:51,359
Are you stupid?

818
00:38:51,361 --> 00:38:53,361
Don't call me stupid
one more fucking time!

819
00:38:53,363 --> 00:38:54,795
Ok, I'm sorry, ok?

820
00:38:54,797 --> 00:38:56,663
Tony: Yo, Mike.

821
00:38:56,665 --> 00:39:00,666
Yo, Mike, you there?

822
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:04,602
Where you at, baby?

823
00:39:04,604 --> 00:39:06,704
I don't know, Mike.
I don't know this guy.

824
00:39:06,706 --> 00:39:07,938
How many times
I got to tell you?

825
00:39:07,940 --> 00:39:09,506
He's a friend of mine.

826
00:39:09,508 --> 00:39:10,974
You keep saying that. Big deal.

827
00:39:10,975 --> 00:39:12,441
He ain't no
fucking friend of mine.

828
00:39:12,444 --> 00:39:13,743
Ok.

829
00:39:16,581 --> 00:39:19,715
Ha ha ha!

830
00:39:19,717 --> 00:39:22,717
You playing, right?

831
00:39:26,089 --> 00:39:30,891
Ok. Keep it out, all right?

832
00:39:30,893 --> 00:39:32,692
Now, don't let him leave,

833
00:39:32,694 --> 00:39:34,593
and whatever you do,

834
00:39:34,595 --> 00:39:36,828
don't fucking shoot him.

835
00:39:36,830 --> 00:39:38,329
Ok?

836
00:39:38,331 --> 00:39:40,664
I'm going to go up on the roof.

837
00:39:40,666 --> 00:39:42,399
Mike.

838
00:39:42,401 --> 00:39:43,867
Mike.

839
00:40:24,541 --> 00:40:29,544
Goddamn, this place
is fucked up.

840
00:40:45,594 --> 00:40:46,726
Trick or treat, motherfucker.

841
00:40:46,728 --> 00:40:49,762
Yo! No problem, baby,
all right?

842
00:40:49,764 --> 00:40:50,929
Shut up!

843
00:40:50,931 --> 00:40:52,964
Step in the middle
of the floor, slick.

844
00:40:52,966 --> 00:40:53,831
Nice and easy.

845
00:40:53,833 --> 00:40:54,765
Right here ok, chief?

846
00:40:54,767 --> 00:40:56,133
That's fine. Just fine.

847
00:40:56,135 --> 00:40:57,835
Ok.

848
00:40:57,836 --> 00:40:59,536
Hey, hey, fucker!
Use your head.

849
00:40:59,538 --> 00:41:01,004
Empty out your pockets
on the table there

850
00:41:01,006 --> 00:41:02,605
and be very, very careful.

851
00:41:02,607 --> 00:41:04,673
Careful is my middle name, man.

852
00:41:04,675 --> 00:41:06,741
Just don't shoot
a brother is all I'm saying.

853
00:41:06,743 --> 00:41:08,626
Just so long as the brother

854
00:41:08,627 --> 00:41:10,510
keeps his hands
where I can see them.

855
00:41:19,788 --> 00:41:21,621
It's all I got, chief.

856
00:41:21,623 --> 00:41:23,823
I hate carrying this thing.
Keeps the old lady

857
00:41:23,825 --> 00:41:25,241
off my case, you know
what I'm saying?

858
00:41:25,242 --> 00:41:26,658
Hey, I ain't interested
in your life story, pal.

859
00:41:26,661 --> 00:41:28,694
You sit down over there
nice and easy,

860
00:41:28,696 --> 00:41:32,964
and keep your fucking hands up.

861
00:41:33,733 --> 00:41:36,033
You got it.

862
00:41:44,142 --> 00:41:45,124
Yo, my man.

863
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:46,107
What the fuck do you want?

864
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,068
Is Mike here?

865
00:41:47,069 --> 00:41:48,027
How the fuck should I know?

866
00:41:48,028 --> 00:41:48,986
Didn't I hear
two people up here?

867
00:41:48,987 --> 00:41:49,945
Who gives a fuck
what you heard?

868
00:41:49,947 --> 00:41:51,697
Look, I'm just
trying to make sure

869
00:41:51,698 --> 00:41:53,448
I'm in the right place.
That's all I'm saying.

870
00:41:53,450 --> 00:41:54,850
Now, he called my old lady,

871
00:41:54,851 --> 00:41:56,251
said he was trying to
find his sister Debbie.

872
00:41:56,252 --> 00:41:57,652
I just want to see if I
can help a brother out.

873
00:41:57,654 --> 00:42:02,657
Oh, great. Another one
with the brother shit.

874
00:42:06,896 --> 00:42:08,862
So, you're a friend
of his, huh?

875
00:42:08,864 --> 00:42:11,497
Look, man, that's
my motherfucking man.

876
00:42:11,499 --> 00:42:12,698
Go back like car seats, baby.

877
00:42:12,700 --> 00:42:15,901
There's too much crime
and too much time.

878
00:42:15,903 --> 00:42:17,869
See what I'm saying?

879
00:42:18,738 --> 00:42:20,471
Oh, Christ almighty.

880
00:42:20,473 --> 00:42:21,605
You all right, man?

881
00:42:21,607 --> 00:42:22,939
Yeah, I'm fine.

882
00:42:22,941 --> 00:42:24,023
I got to take a piss.

883
00:42:24,024 --> 00:42:25,106
Go ahead, man, take a break.

884
00:42:25,109 --> 00:42:26,809
I ain't gonna give you no...

885
00:42:26,810 --> 00:42:28,510
you, just be quiet
till Mike gets back.

886
00:42:28,512 --> 00:42:29,867
Oh, so he's here?

887
00:42:29,868 --> 00:42:31,223
Yeah, he's up at the roof.

888
00:42:31,224 --> 00:42:32,579
He said you was to wait
for him till he comes down.

889
00:42:32,582 --> 00:42:34,181
Said to keep you here.

890
00:42:45,994 --> 00:42:47,093
Yo, my man.

891
00:42:47,095 --> 00:42:48,194
What?

892
00:42:48,196 --> 00:42:50,596
Can I put my hands down now?

893
00:42:50,598 --> 00:42:52,965
Yeah.

894
00:42:53,734 --> 00:42:55,200
Don't think I won't cap you one

895
00:42:55,201 --> 00:42:56,667
just because you're
a friend of Mike's.

896
00:42:56,670 --> 00:42:59,270
No problem, man.

897
00:42:59,272 --> 00:43:00,504
Yo, what's your name?

898
00:43:00,506 --> 00:43:01,738
What? Are we fucking friends?

899
00:43:01,740 --> 00:43:04,006
What's your name, man?

900
00:43:04,008 --> 00:43:05,124
Torch.

901
00:43:05,125 --> 00:43:06,241
I'm Tony t. Nice to meet you.

902
00:43:06,243 --> 00:43:07,842
Whatever.

903
00:43:11,180 --> 00:43:13,013
I seen you somewhere
before, right?

904
00:43:13,015 --> 00:43:14,081
Never.

905
00:43:14,082 --> 00:43:15,148
You sure I ain't
never met you before?

906
00:43:15,150 --> 00:43:17,334
Hey, let me tell you something.

907
00:43:17,335 --> 00:43:19,519
I never seen you before.
You never seen me before.

908
00:43:19,521 --> 00:43:21,104
I don't know you.
I don't want to know you.

909
00:43:21,105 --> 00:43:22,688
I'd just as soon shoot you
as look at you. You got it?

910
00:43:22,690 --> 00:43:24,623
I got it, man.
No problem, all right?

911
00:43:24,625 --> 00:43:26,891
Put your fucking hands
behind your head.

912
00:43:26,893 --> 00:43:28,726
Mikey?

913
00:43:28,728 --> 00:43:30,094
Mikey, man.

914
00:43:30,096 --> 00:43:31,228
I got to take a leak, man.

915
00:43:31,230 --> 00:43:32,496
You better get down here fast,

916
00:43:32,497 --> 00:43:33,763
or I'm going to fucking
put one in your friend here.

917
00:43:33,765 --> 00:43:35,931
Hey, yo, take it
easy, all right?

918
00:43:35,933 --> 00:43:38,166
You, shut the fuck up.

919
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,738
Oh, shit.

920
00:43:45,740 --> 00:43:47,039
Ohh!

921
00:43:49,009 --> 00:43:53,544
Ohh... Ohh, shit!

922
00:43:53,546 --> 00:43:54,278
Shit, no.

923
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:55,612
Mike: Oh, yeah, Billy.

924
00:43:55,614 --> 00:43:56,613
Motherfucker!

925
00:43:56,615 --> 00:43:58,715
Oh, shit! Fuck, man, whoa!

926
00:43:58,717 --> 00:44:00,850
Take it easy, torch.

927
00:44:00,852 --> 00:44:04,053
Give me the gun.
Don't shoot, ok?

928
00:44:04,055 --> 00:44:05,220
What's the matter? You ok, bro?

929
00:44:05,222 --> 00:44:06,688
Don't fucking call me that.

930
00:44:06,690 --> 00:44:08,790
What's the matter?
Tony, what happened?

931
00:44:08,792 --> 00:44:09,891
I think your boy had
a little accident.

932
00:44:09,893 --> 00:44:12,260
I pissed my fucking pants, man.

933
00:44:12,262 --> 00:44:17,698
Oh... Shit, uh...
I'm sorry, bro.

934
00:44:17,700 --> 00:44:20,734
Hold up. Hold up.
Come here. Come on.

935
00:44:20,736 --> 00:44:23,670
Now, you sit
over here, all right?

936
00:44:23,672 --> 00:44:24,737
There you go.

937
00:44:24,739 --> 00:44:25,704
20/20 Mike.

938
00:44:25,706 --> 00:44:28,707
Tony t., what's up, huh? Ha ha!

939
00:44:28,709 --> 00:44:29,841
So, what happened, Mike?

940
00:44:29,843 --> 00:44:31,609
Fellas, can I get
a hand over here?

941
00:44:31,611 --> 00:44:33,678
Hey, yo, chill.

942
00:44:33,679 --> 00:44:35,746
We'll get you cleaned up
in a second, ok?

943
00:44:37,583 --> 00:44:39,249
Tony: What up, Mike?

944
00:44:39,251 --> 00:44:40,600
Well, it's a long story.

945
00:44:40,601 --> 00:44:41,950
Hey, you ain't seen nobody
following you, did you?

946
00:44:41,953 --> 00:44:43,619
No. Two dudes on the corner

947
00:44:43,621 --> 00:44:45,621
using the pay phone.

948
00:44:45,623 --> 00:44:47,145
Word?

949
00:44:47,146 --> 00:44:48,668
Word.<i> Suave,</i> Mike.

950
00:44:48,669 --> 00:44:50,191
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
<i>Suave.</i> We cool.

951
00:44:50,194 --> 00:44:53,762
You bet. Torch, ok?

952
00:44:53,764 --> 00:44:54,997
Fuck you.

953
00:44:54,998 --> 00:44:56,231
Torch: Fuck the both
of you cocksuckers.

954
00:44:56,232 --> 00:44:57,465
I'm bleeding.
My fucking hand's killing me.

955
00:44:57,466 --> 00:44:58,699
I'm soaked to the gills
in my own piss,

956
00:44:58,702 --> 00:45:00,168
for Christ's sakes.

957
00:45:00,170 --> 00:45:01,269
Torch, just take it easy, ok?

958
00:45:01,271 --> 00:45:02,937
It's all right.
I got some old sweats

959
00:45:02,939 --> 00:45:04,204
in my ride downstairs.

960
00:45:04,206 --> 00:45:05,905
I'll go get them,
bring them up,

961
00:45:05,907 --> 00:45:07,356
get you out
of them pissy pants,

962
00:45:07,357 --> 00:45:08,806
get you cleaned up, all right?

963
00:45:08,809 --> 00:45:10,642
Well, hurry up. What the fuck
are waiting on?

964
00:45:10,644 --> 00:45:12,160
I'm dying over here.

965
00:45:12,161 --> 00:45:13,677
Damn, Mike. Where you find
this evil motherfucker?

966
00:45:13,680 --> 00:45:14,645
It's a long story.

967
00:45:14,647 --> 00:45:16,046
Can you get us
something to eat,

968
00:45:16,048 --> 00:45:17,680
and maybe something
to drink, too?

969
00:45:17,682 --> 00:45:19,037
No problem.

970
00:45:19,038 --> 00:45:20,393
Yeah, some cigarettes
and something sweet.

971
00:45:20,394 --> 00:45:21,749
And maybe some stuff
to clean up his hand?

972
00:45:21,752 --> 00:45:23,786
You know, it's
pretty fucked up.

973
00:45:23,788 --> 00:45:25,304
Yeah. No problem, man.

974
00:45:25,305 --> 00:45:26,821
What happened, man?
What did y'all do?

975
00:45:26,824 --> 00:45:29,991
We tried to beat somebody

976
00:45:29,993 --> 00:45:31,325
and we ran
into a little problem.

977
00:45:31,327 --> 00:45:32,359
Tried to beat somebody? Who?

978
00:45:32,361 --> 00:45:33,827
Yeah, well, you
don't want to know.

979
00:45:33,829 --> 00:45:34,894
Manny Rivera, that's who.

980
00:45:34,896 --> 00:45:36,329
Torch: Ok? You can
fucking go now.

981
00:45:36,330 --> 00:45:37,763
Wait a minute. Wait
the fuck a minute here.

982
00:45:37,765 --> 00:45:40,098
You beat Manny Rivera?

983
00:45:40,733 --> 00:45:42,499
For how many keys?

984
00:45:42,501 --> 00:45:44,151
3. Supposed to be 4.

985
00:45:44,152 --> 00:45:45,802
Torch: We lost one.
What a fucking waste.

986
00:45:45,804 --> 00:45:47,148
You got a lot of nerve

987
00:45:47,149 --> 00:45:48,493
talking that shit
after what you did.

988
00:45:48,494 --> 00:45:49,838
You going to start that
fucking shit with me again?

989
00:45:49,841 --> 00:45:50,990
You're so fucking stupid.

990
00:45:50,991 --> 00:45:52,140
The next time you
call me fucking stupid...

991
00:45:52,143 --> 00:45:53,959
there won't be no next time,

992
00:45:53,960 --> 00:45:55,776
Manny Rivera find
you two motherfuckers.

993
00:46:28,877 --> 00:46:31,477
I'm not feeling too good, Mike.

994
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:36,113
You got to stop moving
around so much.

995
00:46:38,550 --> 00:46:41,951
Look, Tony will be back
in a minute, all right?

996
00:46:41,953 --> 00:46:43,252
Let me see your hand.

997
00:46:43,254 --> 00:46:44,553
I can't feel my fingers.

998
00:46:44,555 --> 00:46:47,822
I think I'm going to pass out.

999
00:46:48,891 --> 00:46:50,790
Jesus, man, you all
fucking sweaty and shit.

1000
00:46:50,792 --> 00:46:52,024
That's this fucking cold
I'm trying to catch.

1001
00:46:52,026 --> 00:46:53,291
I'll be fine as soon as
we get out of here.

1002
00:46:53,293 --> 00:46:55,092
All right, all right.
Let me see that hand.

1003
00:46:55,094 --> 00:46:56,960
No, just leave it alone.
It will be fine.

1004
00:46:56,962 --> 00:46:58,362
Come on. You keep it
in your pocket,

1005
00:46:58,363 --> 00:47:00,830
it's only going to get
infected. Let me see.

1006
00:47:00,832 --> 00:47:01,564
No. Ow!

1007
00:47:01,566 --> 00:47:02,531
Let me see.

1008
00:47:02,533 --> 00:47:04,122
No, man, stop.

1009
00:47:04,123 --> 00:47:05,712
Let go of my fucking arm,
for Christ's sakes, will you?

1010
00:47:05,713 --> 00:47:07,302
Yeah, ok, go ahead.
Keep in your pocket.

1011
00:47:07,304 --> 00:47:08,481
Bleed to death, stupid.

1012
00:47:08,482 --> 00:47:09,659
Hey, next fucking time
you call me stupid,

1013
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:10,837
I'll throw you a beating
you'll never forget.

1014
00:47:10,840 --> 00:47:13,841
Oh, right. With one
fucking hand, right?

1015
00:47:13,843 --> 00:47:16,543
You know, that shit gets
infected bad enough,

1016
00:47:16,545 --> 00:47:18,444
you get gangrene.

1017
00:47:18,446 --> 00:47:19,962
Cut the fucking thing
off of you.

1018
00:47:19,963 --> 00:47:21,479
The fuck they will.
Besides, it ain't that bad.

1019
00:47:21,482 --> 00:47:22,914
Oh, that's what you think?

1020
00:47:22,916 --> 00:47:24,032
Well, then, hey.

1021
00:47:24,033 --> 00:47:25,149
See if I give a marvelous fuck

1022
00:47:25,151 --> 00:47:26,049
when it falls off.

1023
00:47:26,051 --> 00:47:28,217
It ain't gonna fall off.

1024
00:47:28,219 --> 00:47:31,286
It ain't that bad.
I'm telling you.

1025
00:47:36,993 --> 00:47:39,960
Just a scratch.

1026
00:47:41,596 --> 00:47:43,095
Ok.

1027
00:47:45,065 --> 00:47:46,531
Yo, house, where's Manny?

1028
00:47:46,533 --> 00:47:48,866
I got to talk to him.

1029
00:47:48,868 --> 00:47:51,335
Manny went to see his mother.

1030
00:47:51,337 --> 00:47:53,403
You take care of your boy?

1031
00:47:53,405 --> 00:47:55,471
I'm working on him.

1032
00:47:55,840 --> 00:47:58,407
Buddha: Hmm.

1033
00:47:59,610 --> 00:48:02,510
Ruffy, you owe me $100.

1034
00:48:02,512 --> 00:48:09,383
Nah, nah. Give him
a chance. He's a virgin.

1035
00:48:12,588 --> 00:48:16,056
What you going to do now?

1036
00:48:16,858 --> 00:48:19,558
Buddha: I don't know
what happened,

1037
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:23,395
but something's
got to be a deal.

1038
00:48:23,397 --> 00:48:24,863
We'll give you another
couple of hours

1039
00:48:24,865 --> 00:48:26,331
to take care of your business.

1040
00:48:26,333 --> 00:48:31,069
Or your business
becomes our business.

1041
00:48:31,071 --> 00:48:33,237
Ahh-ahh!

1042
00:48:33,239 --> 00:48:36,440
Make me some money, baby.

1043
00:48:43,047 --> 00:48:44,613
Look, I didn't want
to say nothing,

1044
00:48:44,615 --> 00:48:46,648
but I think I seen him before.

1045
00:48:46,650 --> 00:48:47,982
Who?

1046
00:48:47,984 --> 00:48:50,918
Your friend there.
Frosted flakes.

1047
00:48:50,920 --> 00:48:51,585
Tony?

1048
00:48:51,587 --> 00:48:53,286
Yeah. You sure?

1049
00:48:53,288 --> 00:48:54,320
Yeah, I'm sure.

1050
00:48:54,322 --> 00:48:56,622
You positive?

1051
00:48:56,624 --> 00:48:58,557
I don't know.
I can't remember where.

1052
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:00,659
How could you forget
somebody like Tony?

1053
00:49:00,661 --> 00:49:02,427
I don't know,
but it will come to me.

1054
00:49:02,429 --> 00:49:03,895
I'll tell you
one fucking thing for sure,

1055
00:49:03,897 --> 00:49:04,929
I don't like him.

1056
00:49:04,930 --> 00:49:05,962
Yeah, well, you didn't like me

1057
00:49:05,965 --> 00:49:08,398
when you met me either,
Mr. Williams.

1058
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,502
Cut me a break with that
Mr. Williams shit.

1059
00:49:12,504 --> 00:49:13,369
Sorry, bro.

1060
00:49:13,371 --> 00:49:15,037
Stop calling me bro.

1061
00:49:15,039 --> 00:49:16,327
Jesus. I've known you
two weeks.

1062
00:49:16,328 --> 00:49:17,616
Already the biggest
pain in the ass

1063
00:49:17,617 --> 00:49:18,905
I've ever had in my
whole fucking life.

1064
00:49:18,909 --> 00:49:20,208
Well, that's only natural

1065
00:49:20,209 --> 00:49:21,508
seeing as how me and you
got the same fucking father.

1066
00:49:21,511 --> 00:49:23,010
You and me is
different, period.

1067
00:49:23,012 --> 00:49:24,244
What you and me got in common,

1068
00:49:24,246 --> 00:49:25,345
I don't want to talk about.

1069
00:49:25,347 --> 00:49:26,646
What I want to know about

1070
00:49:26,648 --> 00:49:28,414
is your friend there...

1071
00:49:28,415 --> 00:49:30,181
fucking Tony the frosted flake.

1072
00:49:30,517 --> 00:49:32,550
Mike: Come on, man.
Fucking Tony the tiger.

1073
00:49:32,552 --> 00:49:33,951
Torch: What's the difference?

1074
00:49:33,952 --> 00:49:35,351
We're talking about
the same guy, right?

1075
00:49:35,354 --> 00:49:36,419
So, what about him?

1076
00:49:36,421 --> 00:49:37,586
How you know we can trust him?

1077
00:49:37,588 --> 00:49:38,871
You see what I'm saying?

1078
00:49:38,872 --> 00:49:40,155
How do you know
he won't rat us out?

1079
00:49:40,157 --> 00:49:42,541
No way!

1080
00:49:42,542 --> 00:49:44,926
Look, man. Me and Tony did
too much time together for that.

1081
00:49:44,928 --> 00:49:45,626
You sure?

1082
00:49:45,628 --> 00:49:46,927
Yeah, I'm sure.

1083
00:49:46,929 --> 00:49:49,546
Positive?

1084
00:49:49,547 --> 00:49:52,164
Absolutely.
Absolutely positive.

1085
00:49:53,268 --> 00:49:55,268
Ok.

1086
00:49:55,270 --> 00:49:58,937
Ok.

1087
00:50:00,707 --> 00:50:01,972
Hey, Mike.

1088
00:50:01,974 --> 00:50:03,139
What?

1089
00:50:03,141 --> 00:50:06,675
You think they'll
really cut my hand off?

1090
00:50:12,014 --> 00:50:15,248
Tony, voice-over:
I was young, impressive,

1091
00:50:15,250 --> 00:50:17,116
hot with my fancy.

1092
00:50:17,118 --> 00:50:21,420
I was known as
the adequate male.

1093
00:50:21,422 --> 00:50:25,290
Oh, but how I cursed the day
I made my play

1094
00:50:25,292 --> 00:50:27,292
for that sidewalk jezebel.

1095
00:50:27,294 --> 00:50:29,527
Manny: Precious.
Hey, come here.

1096
00:50:29,529 --> 00:50:32,263
She was a brown-skinned moll
like a China doll

1097
00:50:32,265 --> 00:50:34,231
walking the path of sin.

1098
00:50:34,233 --> 00:50:37,400
Up and down she trod
with a wink and a nod,

1099
00:50:37,402 --> 00:50:39,535
and this bitch I had to win.

1100
00:50:39,537 --> 00:50:42,004
What's up, Manny?

1101
00:50:42,006 --> 00:50:44,373
No, it was not by chance
I caught her glance

1102
00:50:44,375 --> 00:50:47,309
because I meant
to steal this thing,

1103
00:50:47,311 --> 00:50:50,078
and when she looked at me,
I jumped a league.

1104
00:50:50,080 --> 00:50:53,247
Said it's time
for old slim again.

1105
00:50:54,283 --> 00:50:56,549
Freddie, did you miss us?

1106
00:50:58,535 --> 00:51:00,518
Boo hoo hoo. Trying
to say something?

1107
00:51:00,521 --> 00:51:02,287
What?

1108
00:51:02,289 --> 00:51:04,455
Huh?

1109
00:51:04,457 --> 00:51:06,223
What's the matter?

1110
00:51:06,225 --> 00:51:09,993
You got problems with language?

1111
00:51:09,995 --> 00:51:12,395
Come on, fellas.
Give me a break, man.

1112
00:51:12,397 --> 00:51:14,663
Why you got to treat
a brother like this?

1113
00:51:14,665 --> 00:51:16,048
A brother?

1114
00:51:16,049 --> 00:51:17,432
What are you, a comedian now?

1115
00:51:17,434 --> 00:51:18,599
You a funny man?

1116
00:51:18,601 --> 00:51:20,267
No, man, I'm just trying to add

1117
00:51:20,269 --> 00:51:21,368
a little levity

1118
00:51:21,369 --> 00:51:22,468
to the situation, you know.

1119
00:51:22,471 --> 00:51:23,570
Levity?

1120
00:51:23,572 --> 00:51:24,737
Oh, that's a good idea.

1121
00:51:24,739 --> 00:51:26,438
Here's levity.

1122
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,039
Seriously, fellas,
life's too short.

1123
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:30,307
You shouldn't take
everything so serious.

1124
00:51:30,309 --> 00:51:33,343
Oh, philosophy now, huh?

1125
00:51:34,713 --> 00:51:35,778
Make me laugh.

1126
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:37,063
He's right.

1127
00:51:37,064 --> 00:51:38,347
Make... make Buddha laugh.

1128
00:51:38,349 --> 00:51:39,314
You make him laugh,

1129
00:51:39,316 --> 00:51:41,783
you get to live
a little longer.

1130
00:51:41,785 --> 00:51:44,152
Yeah. Ok. Yeah. All right.

1131
00:51:44,154 --> 00:51:45,186
Show your best.

1132
00:51:45,188 --> 00:51:47,154
Ok. All right,
here's a good one.

1133
00:51:47,156 --> 00:51:48,622
There's a... there's a white guy,

1134
00:51:48,624 --> 00:51:51,358
a Chinese guy, and a black guy,

1135
00:51:51,360 --> 00:51:52,726
all in the fifth grade.

1136
00:51:52,728 --> 00:51:55,595
Who's got the biggest dick?

1137
00:51:55,597 --> 00:51:56,663
I don't know.

1138
00:51:56,664 --> 00:51:57,730
Who's got the biggest dick?

1139
00:51:57,732 --> 00:52:00,065
The black guy, of course.

1140
00:52:00,067 --> 00:52:01,566
He's 18.

1141
00:52:01,568 --> 00:52:03,534
Ha ha ha!

1142
00:52:03,536 --> 00:52:04,568
18...

1143
00:52:04,570 --> 00:52:06,336
You motherfuck...

1144
00:52:06,338 --> 00:52:07,470
ow!

1145
00:52:07,472 --> 00:52:09,104
Looks like you lost
a lot of blood, Billy.

1146
00:52:09,106 --> 00:52:11,172
Yeah. You should have
seen the other guy.

1147
00:52:11,174 --> 00:52:12,573
Yeah. Very funny, very funny.

1148
00:52:12,575 --> 00:52:13,830
Now don't move.

1149
00:52:13,831 --> 00:52:15,086
All right, but it's fucking...

1150
00:52:15,087 --> 00:52:16,342
I told you
it fucking hurts... ow!

1151
00:52:16,345 --> 00:52:17,644
Hey. Quit moving, then.

1152
00:52:17,646 --> 00:52:20,546
You know, we're lucky
to be alive.

1153
00:52:20,548 --> 00:52:22,481
Come on. Quit
fucking moving, Billy.

1154
00:52:22,483 --> 00:52:23,648
You keep fucking
poking, and I told you

1155
00:52:23,650 --> 00:52:25,282
it hurts me,
for Christ's sakes.

1156
00:52:25,284 --> 00:52:26,549
You know, I swear to God
if I get any more

1157
00:52:26,551 --> 00:52:27,834
of your blood on me,
I'm gonna...

1158
00:52:27,835 --> 00:52:29,118
you think you're gonna
fucking catch something?

1159
00:52:29,120 --> 00:52:30,552
Don't worry, I've been
tested more times

1160
00:52:30,554 --> 00:52:31,519
than I can count.

1161
00:52:31,521 --> 00:52:34,038
Yeah. Yeah. Me, too.

1162
00:52:34,039 --> 00:52:36,556
Great. Makes us one
happy fucking family.

1163
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:38,425
Ha ha ha!

1164
00:52:38,427 --> 00:52:39,626
You fucking asshole.

1165
00:52:39,628 --> 00:52:40,827
What are you talking about?

1166
00:52:40,829 --> 00:52:43,229
Look at you, man.

1167
00:52:43,231 --> 00:52:45,364
What?

1168
00:52:45,365 --> 00:52:47,498
You're all fucking
pissy and shit.

1169
00:52:47,501 --> 00:52:48,950
I'm sorry.

1170
00:52:48,951 --> 00:52:50,400
Look, we got to get you
out of the jacket.

1171
00:52:50,403 --> 00:52:51,301
Ok.

1172
00:52:51,303 --> 00:52:52,302
All right?

1173
00:52:52,303 --> 00:52:53,303
Yeah. Take it easy because

1174
00:52:53,305 --> 00:52:54,537
it fucking hurts, all right?

1175
00:52:54,539 --> 00:52:57,573
Don't fuck around.

1176
00:52:57,575 --> 00:52:59,541
Ok.

1177
00:52:59,543 --> 00:53:00,676
On 3...

1178
00:53:00,678 --> 00:53:01,743
let me help you.

1179
00:53:01,745 --> 00:53:02,910
All right. Ready?

1180
00:53:02,912 --> 00:53:05,379
1, 2, 3, go.

1181
00:53:05,381 --> 00:53:06,646
Aah! Fucking shit.

1182
00:53:06,648 --> 00:53:07,680
Attaboy. Attaboy.

1183
00:53:07,682 --> 00:53:10,416
Motherfucking son of a bitch.

1184
00:53:10,418 --> 00:53:12,384
There you go, Billy.

1185
00:53:12,386 --> 00:53:13,852
You did it, huh?

1186
00:53:13,854 --> 00:53:15,253
You did it, all right?

1187
00:53:15,255 --> 00:53:16,220
Fuck, yeah.

1188
00:53:16,222 --> 00:53:17,354
Good. Good.

1189
00:53:17,356 --> 00:53:20,657
Ok. Ok? All right.

1190
00:53:20,659 --> 00:53:21,858
Hey, Mike, wait.

1191
00:53:21,860 --> 00:53:22,792
What? What?

1192
00:53:22,793 --> 00:53:23,725
You ain't gonna tell anybody

1193
00:53:23,728 --> 00:53:25,494
I pissed my pants, are you?

1194
00:53:25,496 --> 00:53:26,728
No, I'm not gonna tell anybody

1195
00:53:26,730 --> 00:53:27,729
you pissed your pants.

1196
00:53:27,731 --> 00:53:28,696
You swear?

1197
00:53:28,698 --> 00:53:31,231
I swear to my mother. Ok?

1198
00:53:31,233 --> 00:53:32,765
Ok.

1199
00:53:32,767 --> 00:53:34,533
Come on, come on.

1200
00:53:34,535 --> 00:53:36,635
Ok.

1201
00:53:36,637 --> 00:53:38,654
All right.

1202
00:53:38,655 --> 00:53:40,672
A guy's going to buy
a brain, right?

1203
00:53:40,674 --> 00:53:42,540
There's a white guy's brain,

1204
00:53:42,542 --> 00:53:43,674
a Chinese guy's brain,

1205
00:53:43,676 --> 00:53:46,710
and a black guy's brain.

1206
00:53:46,712 --> 00:53:48,578
White guy's brain is $200,

1207
00:53:48,580 --> 00:53:51,314
Chinese guy's brain is $300,

1208
00:53:51,316 --> 00:53:54,383
the black guy's brain
is $5,000.

1209
00:53:54,385 --> 00:53:56,551
This guy goes, "hey, how come

1210
00:53:56,553 --> 00:53:59,387
the black guy's brain
is so expensive?"

1211
00:53:59,389 --> 00:54:03,891
The guy goes, "it's
never been used."

1212
00:54:03,893 --> 00:54:04,758
Ha ha ha!

1213
00:54:04,760 --> 00:54:06,893
Never been used, you dumb...

1214
00:54:16,737 --> 00:54:19,304
go ahead. Lay down.

1215
00:54:19,306 --> 00:54:22,440
I like two pillows.

1216
00:54:28,314 --> 00:54:29,813
Mmm.

1217
00:54:51,602 --> 00:54:53,735
So what's up with
you and him, huh?

1218
00:54:53,737 --> 00:54:55,770
What's all this too much crime,

1219
00:54:55,772 --> 00:54:57,671
too much time shit all about?

1220
00:54:57,673 --> 00:54:58,672
Like I say, man,

1221
00:54:58,674 --> 00:54:59,874
too much time, too much crime.

1222
00:54:59,875 --> 00:55:01,097
I mean, it's funny

1223
00:55:01,098 --> 00:55:02,320
we even ended up being friends.

1224
00:55:02,321 --> 00:55:03,543
We were supposed to have
this big fucking fight

1225
00:55:03,545 --> 00:55:05,595
when we met.

1226
00:55:05,596 --> 00:55:07,646
The two of youse was
supposed to fight?

1227
00:55:07,649 --> 00:55:08,615
I'd pay good money

1228
00:55:08,616 --> 00:55:09,582
to see you get your ass kicked.

1229
00:55:09,584 --> 00:55:11,584
Ain't that much
kung foolishness

1230
00:55:11,586 --> 00:55:13,052
in the world, all right?

1231
00:55:13,054 --> 00:55:14,387
I'd have paid.

1232
00:55:14,388 --> 00:55:15,721
Yeah. You and the guy
that started it.

1233
00:55:15,723 --> 00:55:17,489
Fucking garnett...

1234
00:55:17,491 --> 00:55:19,724
little guy
with a big mouth, right?

1235
00:55:19,726 --> 00:55:20,726
Said he was Tony's cousin,

1236
00:55:20,727 --> 00:55:22,316
but he wasn't, right?

1237
00:55:22,317 --> 00:55:23,906
See, what happened was,
we was in the eighth grade.

1238
00:55:23,907 --> 00:55:25,496
It was just before school
was getting out for summer.

1239
00:55:25,498 --> 00:55:26,731
I remember it was hot that day.

1240
00:55:26,732 --> 00:55:27,965
Me and some of my boys
were in the bathroom

1241
00:55:27,967 --> 00:55:29,700
smoking cigarettes
after lunch period.

1242
00:55:29,702 --> 00:55:33,370
So, fucking garnett
comes in with his boys.

1243
00:55:33,372 --> 00:55:34,671
You know. He's wearing, like,

1244
00:55:34,673 --> 00:55:36,351
a brand-new leather jacket,

1245
00:55:36,352 --> 00:55:38,030
talking shit about how
he robbed it off somebody,

1246
00:55:38,031 --> 00:55:39,709
about how he did this,
that, the other thing

1247
00:55:39,711 --> 00:55:40,919
to the guy.

1248
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,128
Anyway, I said
to garnett, I said,

1249
00:55:42,129 --> 00:55:43,337
"what's the big
fucking deal, man?

1250
00:55:43,338 --> 00:55:44,546
It's only
a fucking jacket, right?"

1251
00:55:44,549 --> 00:55:46,782
The next thing I know,

1252
00:55:46,784 --> 00:55:48,250
the punk jumps up in my face.

1253
00:55:48,251 --> 00:55:49,717
You know, talking about
he was gonna kick my ass

1254
00:55:49,720 --> 00:55:50,985
if I didn't mind my business.

1255
00:55:50,987 --> 00:55:52,853
So, I picked him up,
I threw him headfirst

1256
00:55:52,855 --> 00:55:56,056
right into the fucking
toilet bowl.

1257
00:55:57,092 --> 00:55:58,825
Motherfucker did not know
whether to shit

1258
00:55:58,827 --> 00:56:00,927
or go blind, but that
ain't stopping him

1259
00:56:00,929 --> 00:56:02,795
from running his mouth.
No. Mm-mmm.

1260
00:56:02,797 --> 00:56:04,163
He's all like, uh,

1261
00:56:04,164 --> 00:56:05,530
"my cousin Tony's gonna
make you sorry

1262
00:56:05,533 --> 00:56:06,765
you ever messed with me,"
right?

1263
00:56:06,767 --> 00:56:10,034
The next thing I know,
everybody around my way,

1264
00:56:10,036 --> 00:56:12,002
they're telling me
about some big dude

1265
00:56:12,004 --> 00:56:13,704
who's looking for me,

1266
00:56:13,705 --> 00:56:15,405
he's into that fucking
kung fu, karate-type shit.

1267
00:56:15,407 --> 00:56:16,973
So now, I'm bugging
the fuck out, right?

1268
00:56:16,975 --> 00:56:18,474
I mean, I got my switchblade,

1269
00:56:18,476 --> 00:56:19,608
I'm all up and down the Avenue

1270
00:56:19,610 --> 00:56:21,643
looking for this guy.

1271
00:56:21,645 --> 00:56:23,562
I'm standing across the street

1272
00:56:23,563 --> 00:56:25,480
from Danny's candy
store... ping ping.

1273
00:56:25,482 --> 00:56:27,449
Ping ping.

1274
00:56:27,450 --> 00:56:29,417
So I turn around,
and I could see it was him.

1275
00:56:29,419 --> 00:56:32,620
He says to me, "you're Mike?"

1276
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:34,822
I'm like, "yeah, you're Tony?"

1277
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:36,201
He's like, "yeah,"

1278
00:56:36,202 --> 00:56:37,579
so now I got my hand
on the switchblade,

1279
00:56:37,580 --> 00:56:38,957
and I'm hoping I get it
out of my pocket, you know,

1280
00:56:38,961 --> 00:56:42,095
before he commences
to kung foo-ing my ass.

1281
00:56:42,097 --> 00:56:43,863
Next thing I know,
he says to me,

1282
00:56:43,864 --> 00:56:45,630
"you want to go
for a walk?" "Yeah."

1283
00:56:45,633 --> 00:56:46,965
I'm telling you, bro, it was,

1284
00:56:46,967 --> 00:56:49,534
it was like we were
strangers to each other,

1285
00:56:49,536 --> 00:56:50,968
but we wasn't.

1286
00:56:50,970 --> 00:56:54,905
And we've been like this
ever since, man.

1287
00:56:54,907 --> 00:56:57,741
Went to erasmus hall together,

1288
00:56:57,743 --> 00:56:59,876
drank, smoke, got high...

1289
00:56:59,878 --> 00:57:02,445
Ate at each other's house
all the time.

1290
00:57:02,447 --> 00:57:06,615
You saw him, you saw me
and vice versa, yo.

1291
00:57:07,818 --> 00:57:09,117
My mom's practically
adopted him,

1292
00:57:09,119 --> 00:57:12,620
and my sister, Debbie,
forget about it, man.

1293
00:57:12,622 --> 00:57:16,690
She loved her some Tony.

1294
00:57:16,692 --> 00:57:18,141
Senior year, we...

1295
00:57:18,142 --> 00:57:19,591
we got tired
of doing school, you know...

1296
00:57:19,594 --> 00:57:20,960
dropped out, started
doing crime instead.

1297
00:57:20,962 --> 00:57:26,731
Got busted. They done
put us on riker's island.

1298
00:57:26,733 --> 00:57:30,801
I spent a whole 18 months
locked up with this dude.

1299
00:57:30,803 --> 00:57:32,068
I don't even know how
I would have

1300
00:57:32,070 --> 00:57:35,004
done my time without him,
you know?

1301
00:57:35,006 --> 00:57:39,842
He used to recite this...
this poem all the time.

1302
00:57:39,844 --> 00:57:43,779
This crazy, jailhouse
poetry-type shit,

1303
00:57:43,781 --> 00:57:46,348
know what I'm saying?

1304
00:57:46,349 --> 00:57:48,916
Tony: And under them neon
lights, her eyes shone bright,

1305
00:57:48,919 --> 00:57:51,653
and from them, a teardrop fell.

1306
00:57:51,655 --> 00:57:53,955
When I asked her why,
she began to cry

1307
00:57:53,957 --> 00:57:55,690
and tell me this bitter tale,

1308
00:57:55,692 --> 00:57:57,758
all about some guy
that blacks her eye

1309
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,061
and takes all the bread
she gets.

1310
00:58:01,063 --> 00:58:03,563
When she lands in jail,
he won't go for bail,

1311
00:58:03,565 --> 00:58:07,633
and he defies her
to call it quits.

1312
00:58:07,635 --> 00:58:11,670
Well, I said, darling,
dry them tears.

1313
00:58:11,672 --> 00:58:13,655
Have no fear,

1314
00:58:13,656 --> 00:58:15,639
because the tender,
kind lover is here,

1315
00:58:15,642 --> 00:58:19,443
and I'm staking a claim
on all parts of your game.

1316
00:58:19,445 --> 00:58:21,144
I'm vowing to have no peer.

1317
00:58:21,146 --> 00:58:24,080
Well, she looked at me
like a slave set free

1318
00:58:24,082 --> 00:58:26,449
and said, "I'll be your woman."

1319
00:58:26,451 --> 00:58:30,152
And when I left with her,
her man did not stir.

1320
00:58:30,154 --> 00:58:33,722
Yeah. I knew I had me one.

1321
00:58:37,761 --> 00:58:40,628
That shit really
got me through, bro.

1322
00:58:40,630 --> 00:58:42,596
Helped me hang
in there, you know,

1323
00:58:42,598 --> 00:58:43,797
and do my time.

1324
00:58:43,799 --> 00:58:45,632
Mike: And then when we got out,

1325
00:58:45,634 --> 00:58:47,667
and he had Maxine pregnant
with precious,

1326
00:58:47,669 --> 00:58:49,735
he asked me
to be the godfather.

1327
00:58:49,737 --> 00:58:53,638
Me... nobody but me.

1328
00:58:55,675 --> 00:58:59,576
Nah, man. Fuck that noise, man.

1329
00:58:59,744 --> 00:59:02,211
Ain't no way that
he would rat us out.

1330
00:59:02,213 --> 00:59:05,447
That's my motherfucking man.

1331
00:59:05,448 --> 00:59:08,682
Mike: Too much time,
too much crime.

1332
00:59:08,685 --> 00:59:10,885
You know what I'm saying?

1333
00:59:10,887 --> 00:59:14,054
Mike: Torch, you ok?

1334
00:59:14,056 --> 00:59:17,023
Billy.

1335
00:59:17,725 --> 00:59:21,692
Come on. Wake up, bro.

1336
00:59:23,028 --> 00:59:25,161
Yo, Mike.

1337
00:59:29,900 --> 00:59:33,001
I got something sweet, man.

1338
00:59:33,003 --> 00:59:38,639
¶ And the itsy bitsy spider ¶

1339
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:44,211
¶ climbed up the spout again ¶

1340
00:59:44,213 --> 00:59:47,814
somebody's not singing here.

1341
00:59:48,783 --> 00:59:51,917
Who's not singing here?

1342
00:59:51,919 --> 00:59:54,753
Who's not singing here?

1343
00:59:54,755 --> 00:59:57,256
Mommy.

1344
00:59:57,257 --> 00:59:59,758
What's the matter,
mommy? Sing with us.

1345
00:59:59,760 --> 01:00:02,193
Yeah, mommy.

1346
01:00:05,665 --> 01:00:06,730
What time does a Chinese guy

1347
01:00:06,732 --> 01:00:08,064
go to the dentist?

1348
01:00:08,066 --> 01:00:09,665
Look out now.

1349
01:00:09,667 --> 01:00:10,799
2:30.

1350
01:00:10,801 --> 01:00:12,751
Ok.

1351
01:00:12,752 --> 01:00:14,702
"Tooth hurty,"
you fucking... aah!

1352
01:00:17,173 --> 01:00:22,042
Oh, no. It's tooth hurty.

1353
01:00:22,044 --> 01:00:23,943
Aah.

1354
01:00:26,647 --> 01:00:27,879
Come on, come on.

1355
01:00:27,881 --> 01:00:29,731
Why do white people

1356
01:00:29,732 --> 01:00:31,582
go to black people's
garage sales?

1357
01:00:31,584 --> 01:00:32,950
I don't know. Why?

1358
01:00:32,952 --> 01:00:35,052
To get their stuff back.

1359
01:00:35,054 --> 01:00:37,587
Ha ha ha!

1360
01:00:41,793 --> 01:00:42,992
Why did the black guy

1361
01:00:42,994 --> 01:00:45,995
hit the white guy?

1362
01:00:45,997 --> 01:00:49,231
Because he wasn't funny.

1363
01:00:50,167 --> 01:00:52,867
Pace yourself now,
ruffy, come on.

1364
01:00:52,869 --> 01:00:56,203
Don't give yourself
a heart attack.

1365
01:00:56,205 --> 01:00:59,639
Be in control of your emotions.

1366
01:00:59,641 --> 01:01:01,940
Knock, knock.

1367
01:01:04,010 --> 01:01:06,676
Knock, knock.

1368
01:01:08,713 --> 01:01:10,979
Knock, knock.

1369
01:01:11,881 --> 01:01:15,181
No one's home.

1370
01:01:17,318 --> 01:01:18,467
Just one more time,

1371
01:01:18,468 --> 01:01:19,617
break it down for me, man.

1372
01:01:19,620 --> 01:01:21,953
Make me understand.

1373
01:01:21,955 --> 01:01:24,789
Ok?

1374
01:01:24,791 --> 01:01:26,257
Ok.

1375
01:01:26,258 --> 01:01:27,724
Like I say, we got to

1376
01:01:27,727 --> 01:01:30,627
the stuyvesant
hotel around 3:00,

1377
01:01:30,629 --> 01:01:32,228
cased the joint,
like me and you

1378
01:01:32,230 --> 01:01:33,563
used to do back in the day

1379
01:01:33,564 --> 01:01:34,897
when we flim-flammed all
them wall street types.

1380
01:01:34,899 --> 01:01:37,232
Tony: I hear you.

1381
01:01:37,234 --> 01:01:39,867
Now, we were supposed to meet,

1382
01:01:39,869 --> 01:01:41,134
like around 4:00.

1383
01:01:41,136 --> 01:01:43,069
Around about 3:30,
these 3<i> chulitos</i>

1384
01:01:43,071 --> 01:01:44,603
show up I never
seen before, man...

1385
01:01:44,605 --> 01:01:46,121
real young cats.

1386
01:01:46,122 --> 01:01:47,638
Really young... couldn't
have been no more

1387
01:01:47,641 --> 01:01:49,907
than what, 19, 20
years old at the most?

1388
01:01:49,909 --> 01:01:52,276
Yeah. Had on them
baggy clothes,

1389
01:01:52,278 --> 01:01:53,561
fucking cornbred hair...

1390
01:01:53,562 --> 01:01:54,845
they were straight up
stickup kids.

1391
01:01:54,847 --> 01:01:55,779
Mike: They was babies, man.

1392
01:01:55,781 --> 01:01:57,247
Tony, I mean, they were riding

1393
01:01:57,249 --> 01:01:58,948
in an elevator
with 4 kilos of heroin

1394
01:01:58,950 --> 01:02:00,483
and looked like they was still

1395
01:02:00,484 --> 01:02:02,017
on their mama's titty,
<i>ni me pregunte.</i>

1396
01:02:02,019 --> 01:02:04,386
So, we get to the eighth floor.

1397
01:02:04,388 --> 01:02:05,571
I break left. They break right.

1398
01:02:05,572 --> 01:02:06,755
I can feel them
clocking me, right,

1399
01:02:06,757 --> 01:02:07,756
but I never look back.

1400
01:02:07,758 --> 01:02:08,790
No, no, no. I just keep walking

1401
01:02:08,792 --> 01:02:10,091
like I'm going towards my room,

1402
01:02:10,093 --> 01:02:11,826
and what happened?

1403
01:02:11,828 --> 01:02:14,361
Ping ping.

1404
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:16,029
My 20/20 goes off, right?

1405
01:02:16,031 --> 01:02:17,730
Tells me exactly what room

1406
01:02:17,732 --> 01:02:19,098
they go to, right?

1407
01:02:19,100 --> 01:02:20,199
Fucking guy got eyes

1408
01:02:20,201 --> 01:02:21,300
in the back of his head, man.

1409
01:02:21,302 --> 01:02:23,302
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Ping ping.

1410
01:02:23,304 --> 01:02:24,804
So check it:

1411
01:02:24,805 --> 01:02:26,305
I just ease down the hall.

1412
01:02:26,306 --> 01:02:27,806
I couldn't believe
that Manny would send

1413
01:02:27,808 --> 01:02:28,773
such young, dumb motherfuckers

1414
01:02:28,775 --> 01:02:30,207
to deal with all this weight,

1415
01:02:30,209 --> 01:02:31,191
but I figure, ok,

1416
01:02:31,192 --> 01:02:32,174
it makes the job easier, right?

1417
01:02:32,177 --> 01:02:34,510
I knock on the door.
They let me in.

1418
01:02:34,512 --> 01:02:35,628
They frisk me.

1419
01:02:35,629 --> 01:02:36,745
They ask me who I got with me,

1420
01:02:36,747 --> 01:02:38,263
that type of shit.

1421
01:02:38,264 --> 01:02:39,780
I see they're getting
a little nervous.

1422
01:02:39,783 --> 01:02:40,632
So what do I do?

1423
01:02:40,633 --> 01:02:41,482
Try to chill them out
a little bit.

1424
01:02:41,484 --> 01:02:42,867
You know, try to make

1425
01:02:42,868 --> 01:02:44,251
a little light conversation.

1426
01:02:44,253 --> 01:02:45,497
Chill them out,

1427
01:02:45,498 --> 01:02:46,742
tell them how
professional they are.

1428
01:02:46,743 --> 01:02:47,987
You know, how Manny's
a stand-up guy,

1429
01:02:47,990 --> 01:02:49,155
he's always bringing
up new talent,

1430
01:02:49,157 --> 01:02:50,823
it's always a pleasure
doing business

1431
01:02:50,825 --> 01:02:52,325
with him and his people,

1432
01:02:52,326 --> 01:02:53,826
blahsy, blahsy, blahsy,
blip, blip, blip,

1433
01:02:53,828 --> 01:02:54,760
bullshit, bullshit, bullshit.

1434
01:02:54,762 --> 01:02:56,428
Carlito? Chill,<i> papi.</i>

1435
01:02:56,430 --> 01:02:58,863
Mike: They seemed
to chill out after that.

1436
01:02:58,865 --> 01:03:02,365
So, torch knocks on the door.

1437
01:03:03,835 --> 01:03:06,202
The kid lets him in
because he thinks

1438
01:03:06,204 --> 01:03:08,470
that we've got Manny's money.

1439
01:03:08,472 --> 01:03:09,871
Money talks. Bullshit walks.

1440
01:03:09,873 --> 01:03:10,905
Here endeth the lesson.

1441
01:03:10,907 --> 01:03:12,506
That's why the shit
went wrong, bro.

1442
01:03:12,508 --> 01:03:14,174
You came in sweaty

1443
01:03:14,176 --> 01:03:15,875
with your jaws all tight.

1444
01:03:15,877 --> 01:03:16,876
You wasn't cool.

1445
01:03:16,877 --> 01:03:17,876
Fucking guy was reaching
for his piece.

1446
01:03:17,879 --> 01:03:19,011
He never would have fired on us

1447
01:03:19,013 --> 01:03:20,279
if you'd have just chilled.

1448
01:03:20,280 --> 01:03:21,546
Get the fuck out of here.
You don't know that.

1449
01:03:21,548 --> 01:03:23,080
Yeah, I do.
Let me tell you why.

1450
01:03:23,082 --> 01:03:25,782
Because I done it.
Me and Tony, man.

1451
01:03:25,784 --> 01:03:27,817
We were in the same game
with a lot of people, man.

1452
01:03:27,819 --> 01:03:31,386
And you got busted,
though, Mr. Pro.

1453
01:03:32,155 --> 01:03:33,053
Anyway...

1454
01:03:33,055 --> 01:03:34,805
Yeah, anyway...

1455
01:03:34,806 --> 01:03:36,556
So you started shooting.

1456
01:03:36,558 --> 01:03:37,724
Then what?

1457
01:03:37,725 --> 01:03:38,891
You should have seen it, man.

1458
01:03:38,893 --> 01:03:40,053
Fucking bullets are flying...

1459
01:03:41,061 --> 01:03:42,427
Fucking blood was everywhere.

1460
01:03:42,429 --> 01:03:44,262
Man, I must have
fucking shot these kids

1461
01:03:44,264 --> 01:03:46,130
5, 6 fucking times.

1462
01:03:46,132 --> 01:03:47,865
Lit their asses up, man.

1463
01:03:47,867 --> 01:03:49,867
Fucking the whole joint
smelled like gunpowder.

1464
01:03:49,869 --> 01:03:51,902
I didn't even know
I was shot at first.

1465
01:03:51,904 --> 01:03:53,870
It felt more like
something burned me.

1466
01:03:53,872 --> 01:03:54,949
Yeah, yeah.

1467
01:03:54,950 --> 01:03:56,027
And then we lost
one of the 4 kilos

1468
01:03:56,028 --> 01:03:57,105
because you started shooting.

1469
01:03:57,108 --> 01:03:58,341
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1470
01:03:58,342 --> 01:03:59,575
I tried to pick up
what was left.

1471
01:03:59,577 --> 01:04:00,509
The shit was everywhere.

1472
01:04:00,511 --> 01:04:01,855
It was mixed up

1473
01:04:01,856 --> 01:04:03,200
with the shooter's blood
and whatnot.

1474
01:04:03,201 --> 01:04:04,545
Tasted like some very
high-quality shit, though.

1475
01:04:04,548 --> 01:04:06,514
Yeah. Thank you
very fucking much.

1476
01:04:06,516 --> 01:04:08,516
So you picked up
the rest of the shit.

1477
01:04:08,518 --> 01:04:10,050
You got the fuck out of dodge.

1478
01:04:10,052 --> 01:04:12,052
Tony: So afterwards,
where did you go?

1479
01:04:12,054 --> 01:04:13,186
Went to Brooklyn.

1480
01:04:13,188 --> 01:04:14,087
Brooklyn?

1481
01:04:14,088 --> 01:04:14,987
Yeah. Let me
tell you something.

1482
01:04:14,989 --> 01:04:16,288
We could've got busted

1483
01:04:16,289 --> 01:04:17,588
waiting for that
fucking asshole.

1484
01:04:17,591 --> 01:04:18,590
Who?

1485
01:04:18,591 --> 01:04:19,590
Freddie: So what's up, fellas?

1486
01:04:19,593 --> 01:04:20,858
Are we going to
do this or what?

1487
01:04:20,860 --> 01:04:22,860
He's all fucking
worried over here.

1488
01:04:22,862 --> 01:04:24,528
Are we going to move the shit?

1489
01:04:24,530 --> 01:04:25,595
Don't worry about it.

1490
01:04:25,597 --> 01:04:27,597
Yeah, yeah. I got
this guy in sales

1491
01:04:27,598 --> 01:04:29,598
says he can
move the shit no problem.

1492
01:04:29,601 --> 01:04:32,602
So where and when?

1493
01:04:32,604 --> 01:04:34,503
The stuyvesant hotel...

1494
01:04:34,505 --> 01:04:36,071
get this...

1495
01:04:36,073 --> 01:04:37,272
on Halloween.

1496
01:04:37,274 --> 01:04:39,274
Tony: What the fuck
made you think

1497
01:04:39,276 --> 01:04:41,342
you could trust that
motherfucker, Mike?

1498
01:04:41,344 --> 01:04:42,627
Come on, man.

1499
01:04:42,628 --> 01:04:43,911
We used to get all
our flimflam victims

1500
01:04:43,913 --> 01:04:45,713
from him, right?

1501
01:04:45,714 --> 01:04:47,514
Yeah, but didn't you
never stop to think, Mike?

1502
01:04:47,516 --> 01:04:49,482
It might have been him
that set us up

1503
01:04:49,484 --> 01:04:51,250
to get busted, man.

1504
01:04:51,252 --> 01:04:52,351
Yeah, yeah, but...

1505
01:04:52,353 --> 01:04:54,603
But nothing.

1506
01:04:54,604 --> 01:04:56,854
The fucking guy has been
working for Manny for years.

1507
01:04:56,857 --> 01:04:57,856
Word?

1508
01:04:57,858 --> 01:04:59,391
Word.

1509
01:04:59,392 --> 01:05:00,925
Right over here
in the fucking park.

1510
01:05:00,926 --> 01:05:02,459
Yo. Remember when nine lives
got shot in the head?

1511
01:05:02,462 --> 01:05:04,562
Yeah, when Manny...
I remember that.

1512
01:05:04,564 --> 01:05:06,196
That's how he got his name.

1513
01:05:06,198 --> 01:05:06,963
Mm-hmm.

1514
01:05:06,965 --> 01:05:07,964
Well, ever since then,

1515
01:05:07,966 --> 01:05:09,398
Manny has been real
superstitious

1516
01:05:09,400 --> 01:05:10,458
about nine lives.

1517
01:05:10,459 --> 01:05:11,517
I mean, he keeps
that motherfucker around

1518
01:05:11,518 --> 01:05:12,576
like a fucking rabbit's foot.

1519
01:05:12,577 --> 01:05:13,635
They ain't even invented
the type of shit

1520
01:05:13,637 --> 01:05:15,136
that can kill nine lives.

1521
01:05:15,138 --> 01:05:16,804
Where did you hear all this?

1522
01:05:16,805 --> 01:05:18,471
What do you mean,
where did I hear all this?

1523
01:05:18,474 --> 01:05:19,785
I heard it around.

1524
01:05:19,786 --> 01:05:21,097
What do you mean,
you heard it around?

1525
01:05:21,098 --> 01:05:22,409
Around, man. You know, around.

1526
01:05:22,411 --> 01:05:23,443
No, I don't know.

1527
01:05:23,444 --> 01:05:24,476
Around the corner?
Around the block?

1528
01:05:24,479 --> 01:05:26,545
Around the fucking world? What?

1529
01:05:26,547 --> 01:05:28,547
Mike: Come on, torch,
lighten up, all right?

1530
01:05:28,549 --> 01:05:30,582
What the fuck
is your problem, man?

1531
01:05:30,584 --> 01:05:31,861
No problem, Mike.

1532
01:05:31,862 --> 01:05:33,139
I just want to know where
you heard about nine lives.

1533
01:05:33,140 --> 01:05:34,417
You said he's
out of the life, remember?

1534
01:05:34,421 --> 01:05:36,654
So how the fuck does he know?

1535
01:05:41,060 --> 01:05:44,561
Yeah. Where did you
hear all this, Tony?

1536
01:05:44,563 --> 01:05:46,613
Tony: Mike,

1537
01:05:46,614 --> 01:05:48,664
I come to the city sometimes
with my old lady, all right?

1538
01:05:48,667 --> 01:05:50,634
Now, you know Maxine.

1539
01:05:50,635 --> 01:05:52,602
She likes the restaurants,
the shops over here,

1540
01:05:52,604 --> 01:05:54,804
and whatnot.

1541
01:05:54,805 --> 01:05:57,005
I run into people
from back in the day.

1542
01:05:57,008 --> 01:05:59,008
I hear things.

1543
01:05:59,510 --> 01:06:01,443
Hears things.

1544
01:06:01,445 --> 01:06:03,211
Fucking hears things.

1545
01:06:03,213 --> 01:06:04,512
Hear that, Mr. Williams?

1546
01:06:04,514 --> 01:06:05,446
Mike: What?

1547
01:06:05,448 --> 01:06:06,580
Fucking rat is...

1548
01:06:06,582 --> 01:06:07,581
where?

1549
01:06:07,583 --> 01:06:09,549
Right here, bro. Your friend...

1550
01:06:09,551 --> 01:06:12,919
Tony the frosted flake.

1551
01:06:14,088 --> 01:06:15,120
What's the matter, Mike?

1552
01:06:15,122 --> 01:06:16,654
Your fucking ping-ping
ain't working?

1553
01:06:16,656 --> 01:06:18,088
I told you I seen
this guy before.

1554
01:06:18,090 --> 01:06:21,357
All I got
is the white girl, baby.

1555
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:22,624
If you're looking
to score dope,

1556
01:06:22,626 --> 01:06:25,393
you have to take your
business elsewhere.

1557
01:06:25,395 --> 01:06:26,660
See what I'm saying?

1558
01:06:26,662 --> 01:06:27,560
Mike: You sure?

1559
01:06:27,562 --> 01:06:28,994
Torch: Yeah, I'm sure.

1560
01:06:28,996 --> 01:06:30,279
You positive?

1561
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:31,563
Absolutely, absolutely
positive.

1562
01:06:31,565 --> 01:06:33,932
Torch: Freddie,
I got to get well.

1563
01:06:33,934 --> 01:06:35,099
Ok.

1564
01:06:35,101 --> 01:06:37,434
Freddie, what the fuck
you doing?

1565
01:06:37,436 --> 01:06:38,885
What?

1566
01:06:38,886 --> 01:06:40,335
Manny find out
you selling dope,

1567
01:06:40,338 --> 01:06:43,339
he going to crucify your ass.

1568
01:06:43,341 --> 01:06:44,640
Fuck Manny, all right?

1569
01:06:44,642 --> 01:06:47,042
But you wasn't shopping
with your old lady,

1570
01:06:47,044 --> 01:06:48,543
was you, my man?

1571
01:06:48,545 --> 01:06:51,345
You know who I was with, punk.

1572
01:06:51,547 --> 01:06:52,546
Ohh, fuck!

1573
01:06:52,548 --> 01:06:53,713
<i>¡Ay, Tony, coño!</i>

1574
01:06:53,715 --> 01:06:55,581
Not the balls, man!

1575
01:06:55,583 --> 01:06:56,916
Oh, shit! Ow!

1576
01:06:56,917 --> 01:06:58,250
Hey, hey, Tony.
Be careful, man.

1577
01:06:58,252 --> 01:06:59,985
What the fuck are you doing?

1578
01:06:59,987 --> 01:07:01,086
You ok, Billy?

1579
01:07:01,087 --> 01:07:02,186
Hey, what the fuck
is wrong, fellas?

1580
01:07:02,189 --> 01:07:03,233
He's wrong, Mike.

1581
01:07:03,234 --> 01:07:04,278
They're wrong... him
and nine lives.

1582
01:07:04,279 --> 01:07:05,323
I seen them dealing
in the park together.

1583
01:07:05,325 --> 01:07:06,357
They's both working for Manny.

1584
01:07:06,359 --> 01:07:07,958
Who's stupid now, motherfucker?

1585
01:07:07,960 --> 01:07:09,659
Mike. Mike, I can explain.

1586
01:07:09,661 --> 01:07:11,661
Please, Mike. Mike,
you got to listen to me.

1587
01:07:11,663 --> 01:07:13,396
Fucking listen to me, man!

1588
01:07:13,398 --> 01:07:14,630
I'll fuck you up!

1589
01:07:14,632 --> 01:07:16,064
Tony: Listen to me, Mike.

1590
01:07:16,066 --> 01:07:17,298
Mike! Put the gun away, Mike.

1591
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:18,532
Put the fucking gun away!

1592
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:20,700
Ok, ok. I put it away.

1593
01:07:20,702 --> 01:07:22,501
All right.

1594
01:07:28,375 --> 01:07:31,109
Ok. Ok, now I'm
kind of confused, Tony,

1595
01:07:31,111 --> 01:07:32,344
because I don't remember you

1596
01:07:32,345 --> 01:07:33,578
telling me nothing
like that, right?

1597
01:07:33,580 --> 01:07:34,545
Let me explain.

1598
01:07:34,547 --> 01:07:35,512
I remember coming to Jersey

1599
01:07:35,514 --> 01:07:36,679
when precious got baptized.

1600
01:07:36,681 --> 01:07:38,247
You told me you was
out of the life, right?

1601
01:07:38,249 --> 01:07:40,515
You and Maxine,
you opened up a laundromat

1602
01:07:40,517 --> 01:07:41,649
or some shit, right?

1603
01:07:41,651 --> 01:07:42,683
Ok. So what happened to that?

1604
01:07:42,685 --> 01:07:43,968
I don't understand.

1605
01:07:43,969 --> 01:07:45,252
You understand how I could
be a little confused

1606
01:07:45,254 --> 01:07:46,519
when you tell me
you out of the life?

1607
01:07:46,521 --> 01:07:48,387
Now you tell me you
working for Manny, right?

1608
01:07:48,389 --> 01:07:49,588
Mike, I'm sorry, all right?

1609
01:07:49,590 --> 01:07:50,639
Tony, I love you.

1610
01:07:50,640 --> 01:07:51,689
I love you like you
was my own blood.

1611
01:07:51,692 --> 01:07:53,425
<i>Te amo como mi sangre,</i>

1612
01:07:53,426 --> 01:07:55,159
but if you're lying to me,
I swear to God,

1613
01:07:55,162 --> 01:07:56,161
I will fucking kill you.

1614
01:07:56,163 --> 01:07:57,329
Fuck him. Let's waste him,

1615
01:07:57,330 --> 01:07:58,496
take his car, get
the fuck out of dodge

1616
01:07:58,498 --> 01:07:59,463
while we can, man.

1617
01:08:05,536 --> 01:08:06,535
Come on!

1618
01:08:06,537 --> 01:08:08,303
Hold up.

1619
01:08:08,538 --> 01:08:10,054
Hold up.

1620
01:08:10,055 --> 01:08:11,571
What are you waiting for?
Fucking waste him.

1621
01:08:11,574 --> 01:08:14,007
Hold up a minute, all right?

1622
01:08:14,009 --> 01:08:16,609
Go get the phone.

1623
01:08:22,116 --> 01:08:24,316
Torch...

1624
01:08:24,551 --> 01:08:27,285
Check the pay phone.

1625
01:08:28,288 --> 01:08:31,222
Mike: You see anybody there?

1626
01:08:31,224 --> 01:08:34,358
Bet your ass, Mr. Williams.

1627
01:08:35,728 --> 01:08:38,361
Answer it.

1628
01:08:42,666 --> 01:08:44,499
Yeah.

1629
01:08:51,640 --> 01:08:54,073
Yeah.

1630
01:08:54,075 --> 01:08:55,674
No.

1631
01:08:55,676 --> 01:08:58,143
No. Uh-uh.

1632
01:08:58,145 --> 01:08:59,611
Not yet.

1633
01:08:59,613 --> 01:09:02,313
Listen up, you motherfucker.

1634
01:09:02,315 --> 01:09:05,549
Michael, it's Max.

1635
01:09:05,551 --> 01:09:08,585
Max? Hey, hey, Maxine.

1636
01:09:08,587 --> 01:09:10,320
How you doing, girl?

1637
01:09:10,322 --> 01:09:12,588
You know, how come you
always got to drag us

1638
01:09:12,590 --> 01:09:14,122
into your bullshit, Mikey?

1639
01:09:14,124 --> 01:09:16,124
We ain't even heard from
you for 2 or 3 years.

1640
01:09:16,126 --> 01:09:17,792
Yeah, I know, Max,
but what can I do?

1641
01:09:17,794 --> 01:09:20,094
Debbie's my sister,
you know. I love her.

1642
01:09:20,096 --> 01:09:20,895
I got to find her.

1643
01:09:20,896 --> 01:09:21,695
All right. I don't want to hear

1644
01:09:21,697 --> 01:09:22,662
about your fucking sister.

1645
01:09:22,664 --> 01:09:24,330
Just put Tony on the phone.

1646
01:09:24,332 --> 01:09:25,631
Come on, Maxine.
Don't be like that.

1647
01:09:25,633 --> 01:09:28,734
Just put Tony on the phone!

1648
01:09:29,336 --> 01:09:31,636
Yeah, ok.

1649
01:09:32,138 --> 01:09:33,570
Yeah, baby.

1650
01:09:34,673 --> 01:09:35,805
I'm sorry, baby.

1651
01:09:35,807 --> 01:09:39,441
Yeah, me, too. You all right?

1652
01:09:39,743 --> 01:09:41,309
Maxine, are you all right?

1653
01:09:41,311 --> 01:09:42,543
Yeah, I'm all right.

1654
01:09:42,545 --> 01:09:44,545
How's my little girl?

1655
01:09:44,547 --> 01:09:45,579
She's sleeping.

1656
01:09:45,581 --> 01:09:47,614
Manny is singing to her.

1657
01:09:47,616 --> 01:09:51,751
You got to get us
out of here, baby.

1658
01:09:51,753 --> 01:09:54,386
You got to get us now.
He's singing to my baby.

1659
01:09:54,388 --> 01:09:56,554
You got to come and
get us right now.

1660
01:09:56,556 --> 01:10:00,790
Maxine, I'll do that
on my way home, ok?

1661
01:10:02,894 --> 01:10:05,461
I'm scared.

1662
01:10:05,463 --> 01:10:07,629
I-I'm scared.

1663
01:10:07,631 --> 01:10:11,199
I'll be there soon as I can.

1664
01:10:11,201 --> 01:10:13,768
I just got to help
Mike out, that's all.

1665
01:10:13,770 --> 01:10:15,636
Maxine: Do it.

1666
01:10:15,638 --> 01:10:16,954
Just do it, ok?

1667
01:10:16,955 --> 01:10:18,271
Just do what you got
to do, you hear me?

1668
01:10:18,273 --> 01:10:20,773
Just do what you got to do.

1669
01:10:20,775 --> 01:10:22,741
Yeah, I hear you.

1670
01:10:22,743 --> 01:10:24,275
I love you.

1671
01:10:24,277 --> 01:10:26,577
Love you, too, baby.

1672
01:10:32,517 --> 01:10:34,216
Maxine sounds good, bro.

1673
01:10:34,218 --> 01:10:35,650
Sounds the same.

1674
01:10:35,652 --> 01:10:38,552
She's the same old Max.

1675
01:10:38,687 --> 01:10:40,219
So what? His old lady called?

1676
01:10:40,221 --> 01:10:41,487
That don't prove shit.

1677
01:10:41,488 --> 01:10:42,754
Still don't mean he ain't
working for Manny.

1678
01:10:42,756 --> 01:10:44,622
I know, but we got
to be cool, right?

1679
01:10:44,624 --> 01:10:45,656
I'm through being cool.

1680
01:10:45,658 --> 01:10:47,691
I say we fucking waste him now.

1681
01:10:47,959 --> 01:10:49,625
You just got to calm down, ok?

1682
01:10:49,627 --> 01:10:51,160
Yeah. Calm down, torch.

1683
01:10:51,161 --> 01:10:52,694
You already got two murder
beats hanging over your head.

1684
01:10:52,696 --> 01:10:54,295
I ain't interested
in being the third.

1685
01:10:54,297 --> 01:10:57,364
The night is young,
motherfucker.

1686
01:10:58,500 --> 01:11:00,299
Where are you going, Tony?

1687
01:11:00,301 --> 01:11:01,566
Where are you going?

1688
01:11:01,568 --> 01:11:03,334
Ooh!

1689
01:11:03,336 --> 01:11:04,702
How your balls
feel there, fucko?

1690
01:11:04,704 --> 01:11:05,969
Ok,<i> maricón.</i>

1691
01:11:05,971 --> 01:11:07,971
Tell me something, t.

1692
01:11:07,973 --> 01:11:10,573
Come on. Talk to me.

1693
01:11:10,575 --> 01:11:11,440
<i>Dime.</i>

1694
01:11:11,442 --> 01:11:13,508
All right. All right.

1695
01:11:13,510 --> 01:11:15,527
All right.

1696
01:11:15,528 --> 01:11:17,545
I started working for Manny
after we got out of riker's.

1697
01:11:17,547 --> 01:11:20,581
Me and nine lives were slinging
jobs over in seward park.

1698
01:11:20,583 --> 01:11:22,349
Now, I never liked
being around him,

1699
01:11:22,351 --> 01:11:23,634
but business is business.

1700
01:11:23,635 --> 01:11:24,918
We only worked together
for about a year.

1701
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,452
He could never stop
running his mouth

1702
01:11:26,454 --> 01:11:28,654
about how much money
he was going to be making,

1703
01:11:28,656 --> 01:11:29,721
how Manny was going
to hook him up

1704
01:11:29,723 --> 01:11:31,022
with a franchise
of his own now.

1705
01:11:31,024 --> 01:11:32,823
You know what I mean, Mike?

1706
01:11:32,825 --> 01:11:36,259
I kept my mouth shut
and went about my business,

1707
01:11:36,261 --> 01:11:37,427
but Manny heard.

1708
01:11:37,428 --> 01:11:38,594
Man, all the wolf tickets
that nine lives was selling

1709
01:11:38,596 --> 01:11:40,295
decided to cash in on him.

1710
01:11:40,297 --> 01:11:41,530
One day, I look up,

1711
01:11:41,531 --> 01:11:42,764
walks up to nine lives
in seward park,

1712
01:11:42,766 --> 01:11:44,265
shot him in the head.

1713
01:11:44,267 --> 01:11:46,700
Then I come into thinking, man,

1714
01:11:46,702 --> 01:11:49,536
about getting
out of the life, you know?

1715
01:11:49,538 --> 01:11:52,438
About getting my shit together.

1716
01:11:52,440 --> 01:11:55,741
Max was pregnant with
precious at the time, man.

1717
01:11:55,743 --> 01:11:59,845
I wanted to be around
to see my firstborn,

1718
01:11:59,847 --> 01:12:01,479
so I went to Manny.

1719
01:12:01,481 --> 01:12:03,781
I told him how I was feeling
about my situation,

1720
01:12:03,783 --> 01:12:05,516
and he was cool, man,

1721
01:12:05,518 --> 01:12:07,718
so I took my little bit
of chump change that I made

1722
01:12:07,719 --> 01:12:09,919
from slinging them rocks,
and I stepped the fuck off,

1723
01:12:09,922 --> 01:12:10,921
moved to Jersey.

1724
01:12:10,923 --> 01:12:12,355
I got my little storefront...

1725
01:12:12,357 --> 01:12:13,989
some washing machines,
a couple of dryers,

1726
01:12:13,991 --> 01:12:16,558
and that's when I went
into business for myself.

1727
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:19,027
So I swear to you, Mike,

1728
01:12:19,029 --> 01:12:21,596
on my little girl, man,

1729
01:12:21,598 --> 01:12:23,965
I ain't had no further
conversations with Manny

1730
01:12:23,967 --> 01:12:27,635
or fucking Freddie nine lives
or anybody else in the life

1731
01:12:27,637 --> 01:12:29,737
except for you.

1732
01:12:29,939 --> 01:12:31,905
The only reason
I didn't tell you

1733
01:12:31,907 --> 01:12:36,676
was I didn't want
to let you down.

1734
01:12:37,645 --> 01:12:39,011
Word is bond, man?

1735
01:12:39,013 --> 01:12:41,680
My word is bond.

1736
01:12:41,682 --> 01:12:43,581
Now she caught on kind of fast

1737
01:12:43,583 --> 01:12:44,782
as the months rolled past.

1738
01:12:44,783 --> 01:12:45,982
Are we game
till the bitter end?

1739
01:12:45,985 --> 01:12:48,719
A better ho I have yet to know,

1740
01:12:48,721 --> 01:12:51,621
and they claim a dog
is a man's best friend.

1741
01:12:51,623 --> 01:12:55,091
She ran with the best,
from the east to the west.

1742
01:12:55,093 --> 01:12:57,326
I liked when her
boosting hand came down.

1743
01:12:57,328 --> 01:12:59,728
Many, many a chump
got left in the dumps

1744
01:12:59,730 --> 01:13:01,996
as we stole from them
in all of them towns.

1745
01:13:01,998 --> 01:13:04,732
Yeah, I laid, and I played

1746
01:13:04,734 --> 01:13:06,033
off the bread this bitch made

1747
01:13:06,035 --> 01:13:07,601
from the coast to old Broadway.

1748
01:13:07,603 --> 01:13:09,736
My habits were small,
and the money was tall.

1749
01:13:09,738 --> 01:13:11,804
I really made
this business pay.

1750
01:13:11,806 --> 01:13:13,539
Torch: What a fucking
fairy tale.

1751
01:13:13,541 --> 01:13:14,606
Don't believe him.
Don't believe him.

1752
01:13:14,608 --> 01:13:15,791
He's only trying
to save his ass.

1753
01:13:15,792 --> 01:13:16,975
We're going to have
to trust him.

1754
01:13:16,977 --> 01:13:17,742
Why?

1755
01:13:17,744 --> 01:13:18,793
Because I say so.

1756
01:13:18,794 --> 01:13:19,843
Look. Fuck that.
Give me the piece.

1757
01:13:19,844 --> 01:13:20,893
You don't want to do him?
I'll do him.

1758
01:13:20,894 --> 01:13:21,943
How many fucking times
I got to tell you "no"?

1759
01:13:21,948 --> 01:13:23,547
We ain't going
to do it your way.

1760
01:13:23,549 --> 01:13:24,648
Why the fuck not?

1761
01:13:24,649 --> 01:13:25,748
Look. If I was
working for Manny,

1762
01:13:25,751 --> 01:13:26,816
you'd be dead already.

1763
01:13:26,818 --> 01:13:27,683
Ah, yeah. Maybe.

1764
01:13:27,685 --> 01:13:28,717
Ain't no maybe about it

1765
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:30,452
because the longer
you sit here,

1766
01:13:30,454 --> 01:13:33,555
it's only a matter of time
before he finds you.

1767
01:13:33,557 --> 01:13:34,990
Come on. Think
for a minute, man.

1768
01:13:34,991 --> 01:13:36,424
Use your head. Maybe
he's telling the truth.

1769
01:13:36,426 --> 01:13:37,492
Yeah, maybe, but...

1770
01:13:37,493 --> 01:13:38,559
come on. I want you
to trust me on this,

1771
01:13:38,561 --> 01:13:39,605
all right?

1772
01:13:39,606 --> 01:13:40,650
I've known this guy
over half my life.

1773
01:13:40,651 --> 01:13:41,695
If he says he quit
Manny, I believe him.

1774
01:13:41,697 --> 01:13:43,063
Ok. We let him live for now.

1775
01:13:43,065 --> 01:13:46,466
I still don't
like you, motherfucker.

1776
01:13:46,468 --> 01:13:47,667
Check the pay phone.

1777
01:13:47,669 --> 01:13:51,904
See if our friend
is still there.

1778
01:14:34,781 --> 01:14:36,847
Mike.

1779
01:14:37,416 --> 01:14:38,715
Why heroin, man?

1780
01:14:38,717 --> 01:14:40,717
Thought you'd stay
away from that shit.

1781
01:14:40,719 --> 01:14:42,685
Debbie being
a dope fiend, and all.

1782
01:14:42,687 --> 01:14:44,053
I told you before, Tony.

1783
01:14:44,054 --> 01:14:45,420
My sister ain't got
nothing to do with this.

1784
01:14:45,423 --> 01:14:46,578
You understand me?

1785
01:14:46,579 --> 01:14:47,734
Debbie's clean. She's clean.

1786
01:14:47,735 --> 01:14:48,890
Oh, she's clean?
I didn't know that, man.

1787
01:14:48,893 --> 01:14:50,659
That's really beautiful.

1788
01:14:50,660 --> 01:14:52,426
How's she doing anyway?
Where she at?

1789
01:14:52,429 --> 01:14:53,484
Arizona.

1790
01:14:53,485 --> 01:14:54,540
They got some kind of
rehab program out there.

1791
01:14:54,541 --> 01:14:55,596
Yeah? What's it like
in Arizona?

1792
01:14:55,598 --> 01:14:56,730
How the fuck should I know?

1793
01:14:56,732 --> 01:14:57,997
Thought maybe your
sister might call you

1794
01:14:57,999 --> 01:14:58,964
or write you or something.

1795
01:14:58,966 --> 01:15:00,282
Jeez, it's a normal question.

1796
01:15:00,283 --> 01:15:01,599
People have families,
they try to stick close,

1797
01:15:01,601 --> 01:15:02,683
that's all.

1798
01:15:02,684 --> 01:15:03,766
Oh, so now you want to
talk about family, right?

1799
01:15:03,769 --> 01:15:04,634
Forget it!

1800
01:15:04,636 --> 01:15:06,386
Yeah. Thought so.

1801
01:15:06,387 --> 01:15:08,137
If it wasn't your idea,
whose was it? Nine lives?

1802
01:15:08,139 --> 01:15:09,037
No, it was mine.

1803
01:15:09,039 --> 01:15:10,088
That fucking figures.

1804
01:15:10,089 --> 01:15:11,138
Fuck is that supposed to mean?

1805
01:15:11,141 --> 01:15:12,640
How's your cold, my man?

1806
01:15:12,642 --> 01:15:13,775
Fuck you.

1807
01:15:13,776 --> 01:15:14,909
Don't fuck with me.
How's your cold, junkie?

1808
01:15:14,910 --> 01:15:16,043
Hey, Tony, what the fuck
you talking about?

1809
01:15:16,045 --> 01:15:17,144
I'm talking
about your boy there.

1810
01:15:17,146 --> 01:15:18,112
Can't you see he's jonesing?

1811
01:15:18,113 --> 01:15:19,079
Don't listen to this guy, Mike.

1812
01:15:19,080 --> 01:15:20,046
He's full of shit.
He doesn't know

1813
01:15:20,048 --> 01:15:21,614
what the fuck
he's talking about.

1814
01:15:21,615 --> 01:15:23,181
He ain't no junkie, Tony.
He's just got a cold.

1815
01:15:23,184 --> 01:15:24,016
That's all.

1816
01:15:24,018 --> 01:15:25,017
Wake the fuck up, bro.

1817
01:15:25,019 --> 01:15:26,936
Boy's got the chills.

1818
01:15:26,937 --> 01:15:28,854
His nose is running like
a fucking v-8 engine.

1819
01:15:28,856 --> 01:15:29,988
Got no tracks, motherfucker.

1820
01:15:29,990 --> 01:15:31,022
See, Mike? No tracks.

1821
01:15:31,024 --> 01:15:32,089
What about your feet?

1822
01:15:32,091 --> 01:15:32,956
What about them?

1823
01:15:32,958 --> 01:15:34,441
I peeked them after you

1824
01:15:34,442 --> 01:15:35,925
had your little accident,
stupid-ass junkie.

1825
01:15:35,927 --> 01:15:38,627
Should have killed you
when I had the chance,

1826
01:15:38,629 --> 01:15:40,829
you motherfucker.

1827
01:15:41,898 --> 01:15:43,197
Aah!

1828
01:15:43,199 --> 01:15:44,849
Aah!

1829
01:15:44,850 --> 01:15:46,500
Mother, sit your
fucking ass down.

1830
01:15:46,502 --> 01:15:47,167
Come on, man.

1831
01:15:47,169 --> 01:15:48,518
Check his feet, Mike.

1832
01:15:48,519 --> 01:15:49,868
If you don't believe me,
check out his fucking feet.

1833
01:15:49,871 --> 01:15:50,953
Get off me, man! Ow!

1834
01:15:50,954 --> 01:15:52,036
I swear to God, Mike. No lie.

1835
01:15:52,039 --> 01:15:53,638
Check out his fucking feet.

1836
01:15:53,640 --> 01:15:56,707
Ow! Get the fu... ow! Fuck! Ow!

1837
01:15:56,709 --> 01:15:57,958
It ain't what
it looks like, Mike.

1838
01:15:57,959 --> 01:15:59,208
I swear to God,
it ain't that bad.

1839
01:15:59,211 --> 01:16:01,544
Man, I'm just chipping,
that's all.

1840
01:16:01,546 --> 01:16:03,145
Ow. Fuck! Let me up, man.

1841
01:16:03,147 --> 01:16:05,747
Everybody in my family
got to be hooked on dope.

1842
01:16:05,749 --> 01:16:07,048
You related to this asshole?

1843
01:16:07,050 --> 01:16:08,333
He's my brother, man.

1844
01:16:08,334 --> 01:16:09,617
Half brother,
you fucking prick.

1845
01:16:09,619 --> 01:16:10,618
Shut the fuck up!

1846
01:16:10,620 --> 01:16:11,936
Ow! Ow! Fuck! Ow!

1847
01:16:11,937 --> 01:16:13,253
What's the matter,
junkie? You sick?

1848
01:16:13,255 --> 01:16:14,854
Say "please," dope fiend.

1849
01:16:14,856 --> 01:16:16,088
Say "please"!

1850
01:16:16,090 --> 01:16:17,722
Leave him alone.

1851
01:16:17,724 --> 01:16:20,490
Ow!

1852
01:16:22,727 --> 01:16:25,027
Oh, Mike. That
fucking hurt, Mike.

1853
01:16:25,029 --> 01:16:28,697
Oh, man, you got to
fucking help me, man.

1854
01:16:28,699 --> 01:16:32,667
Ok. Ok. I got you.
I got you, all right?

1855
01:16:32,669 --> 01:16:33,834
We're brothers, right?

1856
01:16:33,836 --> 01:16:35,035
<i>Somos hermanos ¿verdad?</i>

1857
01:16:35,037 --> 01:16:37,003
We got to look after
each other, right?

1858
01:16:37,005 --> 01:16:38,955
Damn, Mike.

1859
01:16:38,956 --> 01:16:40,906
I ain't even know
you had a brother,

1860
01:16:40,908 --> 01:16:43,008
let alone one who was...

1861
01:16:43,010 --> 01:16:45,744
Well, you know it.

1862
01:16:45,746 --> 01:16:49,280
I'm sorry, all right?

1863
01:16:50,716 --> 01:16:52,048
Tony: I'm sorry, man.

1864
01:16:52,050 --> 01:16:54,283
So you all never
met before, right?

1865
01:16:54,285 --> 01:16:57,119
You never knew anything
about each other

1866
01:16:57,121 --> 01:16:58,787
or nothing?

1867
01:16:58,789 --> 01:17:00,088
Damn.

1868
01:17:00,090 --> 01:17:01,823
Your pops was a player.

1869
01:17:01,825 --> 01:17:03,558
Yeah. I'd like to kill him
for what he did

1870
01:17:03,560 --> 01:17:04,793
to me and my mother.

1871
01:17:04,794 --> 01:17:06,027
He didn't break
your mother's heart

1872
01:17:06,028 --> 01:17:07,261
by knocking up some poor
bitch from the projects.

1873
01:17:07,263 --> 01:17:09,529
Hey, listen. You can
talk about your father

1874
01:17:09,531 --> 01:17:10,930
any way you want to, ok?

1875
01:17:10,932 --> 01:17:12,231
But when you talk
about my mother,

1876
01:17:12,232 --> 01:17:13,531
you better show her
some fucking respect.

1877
01:17:13,534 --> 01:17:15,000
<i>¿Oiste?</i> You heard what I said?

1878
01:17:15,002 --> 01:17:18,103
Yeah, yeah. I heard you
twice the first time.

1879
01:17:18,105 --> 01:17:19,204
Let me tell you something

1880
01:17:19,206 --> 01:17:21,739
about your old man, Mike.

1881
01:17:21,741 --> 01:17:23,540
When I was in high school,

1882
01:17:23,542 --> 01:17:24,874
I was a complete
fucking ignoramus

1883
01:17:24,876 --> 01:17:27,643
when it came to reading,
writing, arithmetic,

1884
01:17:27,645 --> 01:17:29,778
but I always got
good grades in math.

1885
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:32,381
You know why?

1886
01:17:32,382 --> 01:17:34,983
Because the old man was
fucking my math teacher.

1887
01:17:34,985 --> 01:17:36,217
Miss delvecchio.

1888
01:17:36,219 --> 01:17:37,551
Never paid attention

1889
01:17:37,553 --> 01:17:40,221
to what we were
supposed to be learning,

1890
01:17:40,223 --> 01:17:41,222
so she calls my parents

1891
01:17:41,224 --> 01:17:44,325
to have a meeting
about my grades.

1892
01:17:44,327 --> 01:17:46,894
So the old man comes
down to the school,

1893
01:17:46,896 --> 01:17:48,145
off we go

1894
01:17:48,146 --> 01:17:49,395
to the guidance
counselor's office.

1895
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:52,132
So after about 5, 10
minutes of conversation

1896
01:17:52,134 --> 01:17:53,800
about my grades, my attitude,

1897
01:17:53,802 --> 01:17:56,002
my attention span, whatever,

1898
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:57,837
she goes to me and Mr. D.,

1899
01:17:57,839 --> 01:17:58,971
"would you gentlemen
step outside

1900
01:17:58,973 --> 01:18:01,840
so I can talk to
Mr. Murphy in private?"

1901
01:18:01,842 --> 01:18:05,210
So I'm sitting in class
just after she came in.

1902
01:18:05,212 --> 01:18:06,945
I remember thinking,

1903
01:18:06,946 --> 01:18:08,679
"there's something
different about her."

1904
01:18:08,682 --> 01:18:11,049
She was always kind of
an uptight broad,

1905
01:18:11,051 --> 01:18:13,718
wore her hair
pinned up in a bun.

1906
01:18:13,720 --> 01:18:16,854
She comes back from
talking to the old man.

1907
01:18:16,856 --> 01:18:18,088
All of a sudden
she's wearing it

1908
01:18:18,090 --> 01:18:19,355
down around her shoulders.

1909
01:18:19,357 --> 01:18:20,823
You know, like out of nowhere,

1910
01:18:20,825 --> 01:18:22,825
she's all relaxed.

1911
01:18:22,827 --> 01:18:24,693
She's got that
well-fucked look,

1912
01:18:24,695 --> 01:18:25,827
you know?

1913
01:18:25,828 --> 01:18:26,960
She never said
another word to me

1914
01:18:26,963 --> 01:18:29,129
for the rest of the year,

1915
01:18:29,131 --> 01:18:30,730
not a fucking word except,

1916
01:18:30,732 --> 01:18:31,831
"thank you, Mr. Murphy,"

1917
01:18:31,833 --> 01:18:32,932
when I handed in my test,

1918
01:18:32,934 --> 01:18:34,800
and that was the reason

1919
01:18:34,802 --> 01:18:38,169
I suddenly became
a mathematical genius.

1920
01:18:40,706 --> 01:18:44,741
Broke my mother's heart.

1921
01:18:44,743 --> 01:18:47,227
Because I knew about it,

1922
01:18:47,228 --> 01:18:49,712
I could never look her
in her eyes again.

1923
01:18:49,714 --> 01:18:52,848
Now I ain't going
to sit here and tell you

1924
01:18:52,850 --> 01:18:54,850
that he didn't give you
and your poor mother

1925
01:18:54,852 --> 01:18:56,140
a hard way to go,

1926
01:18:56,141 --> 01:18:57,429
but me and my mother
put up with more

1927
01:18:57,430 --> 01:18:58,718
of his bullshit
on a day-to-day basis

1928
01:18:58,722 --> 01:19:01,856
than you could ever
imagine, Mike.

1929
01:19:01,858 --> 01:19:04,291
So believe me when I tell you

1930
01:19:04,293 --> 01:19:08,161
I know how you feel, bro.

1931
01:19:08,163 --> 01:19:10,897
Believe me, man, I do.

1932
01:19:10,899 --> 01:19:12,965
Damn.

1933
01:19:13,400 --> 01:19:15,833
That's fucked up, yo.

1934
01:19:16,969 --> 01:19:18,935
Tony: Now, you know
how some bitches cry

1935
01:19:18,937 --> 01:19:22,371
about the wind being high,
cops being on their trail,

1936
01:19:22,373 --> 01:19:25,941
about the snow and the sleet
being asshole-deep

1937
01:19:25,943 --> 01:19:28,443
and all the pimps
can go to hell.

1938
01:19:28,445 --> 01:19:30,978
Sitting in greasy spoons,
jukebox saloons,

1939
01:19:30,980 --> 01:19:32,079
killing a lot of time,

1940
01:19:32,081 --> 01:19:34,448
sucking on beers,
crying hard-luck tears

1941
01:19:34,450 --> 01:19:37,384
while the pimps
ain't got a dime.

1942
01:19:37,386 --> 01:19:38,485
Both: Just sitting

1943
01:19:38,487 --> 01:19:40,453
and bullshitting,

1944
01:19:40,455 --> 01:19:42,288
sucking them party friends.

1945
01:19:42,290 --> 01:19:44,490
Nodding so tough...
they're out messing with stuff...

1946
01:19:44,492 --> 01:19:47,392
that they miss
all the righteous tricks.

1947
01:19:47,394 --> 01:19:49,594
Why, you could lap their lid

1948
01:19:49,595 --> 01:19:51,795
for the lowest bid,
set that young ass on fire...

1949
01:19:51,798 --> 01:19:54,832
the cheapest young girl
you could buy.

1950
01:19:54,834 --> 01:19:57,501
Digging that cunt
for a solid month

1951
01:19:57,503 --> 01:20:00,937
while it's dope that's been
doing all the pimping.

1952
01:20:00,939 --> 01:20:04,206
But not this triple-a
broad of mine.

1953
01:20:04,208 --> 01:20:07,542
She was a sex machine
that could walk between

1954
01:20:07,544 --> 01:20:11,846
raindrops come typhoon,
blizzard, or Gale.

1955
01:20:11,848 --> 01:20:14,782
Standing on the hot brick,
she'd turn a trick.

1956
01:20:14,784 --> 01:20:17,050
Man, she'd trick
with creeps and freaks,

1957
01:20:17,052 --> 01:20:20,820
toenail creeps,
breeds I can't even name,

1958
01:20:20,822 --> 01:20:24,557
eskimo, negroes, Jews,
apache, sioux.

1959
01:20:24,559 --> 01:20:27,526
To her, it was all the same.

1960
01:20:27,528 --> 01:20:30,829
Any way she would follow
that righteous dollar

1961
01:20:30,831 --> 01:20:32,964
to hell if she had to go.

1962
01:20:32,966 --> 01:20:35,066
And be down there just waiting

1963
01:20:35,068 --> 01:20:36,333
that trick with Satan.

1964
01:20:36,335 --> 01:20:38,134
She was really
a money-making ho.

1965
01:20:38,136 --> 01:20:41,003
Why, for a lick or a lap
of that mental trap,

1966
01:20:41,005 --> 01:20:42,504
the tricks defied her due.

1967
01:20:42,506 --> 01:20:45,473
Of course, her longest bread
was made by head,

1968
01:20:45,475 --> 01:20:48,409
and, Jim, how that bitch
could chew.

1969
01:20:48,411 --> 01:20:50,844
Now all my troubles began,

1970
01:20:50,846 --> 01:20:55,314
and I quit snorting
and commenced the hit.

1971
01:20:55,316 --> 01:20:57,816
Now, you know how that go.

1972
01:20:57,818 --> 01:21:01,920
I shot up more dope
than any one bitch could get.

1973
01:21:01,922 --> 01:21:05,523
I sold my shack, my Cadillac,

1974
01:21:05,525 --> 01:21:07,124
the rug from up off my floor.

1975
01:21:07,126 --> 01:21:09,025
I stole from ma and pa,

1976
01:21:09,027 --> 01:21:10,393
and I shot up all that dough.

1977
01:21:10,395 --> 01:21:12,862
My woman cried
and damn near died

1978
01:21:12,864 --> 01:21:14,430
when I ran up with her mink,

1979
01:21:14,432 --> 01:21:17,833
but I stayed in my role,

1980
01:21:17,834 --> 01:21:21,235
and I stole, and I sold
everything but the kitchen sink.

1981
01:21:21,238 --> 01:21:25,306
Down I fell
to the depths of hell.

1982
01:21:25,308 --> 01:21:28,309
I had put myself in a cross.

1983
01:21:28,311 --> 01:21:31,412
My habits got tall,
my money got small,

1984
01:21:31,414 --> 01:21:34,281
but the deadliest blow of all

1985
01:21:34,282 --> 01:21:37,149
came when this bitch
took ill on short notice

1986
01:21:37,152 --> 01:21:39,585
and could no longer gin.

1987
01:21:39,587 --> 01:21:42,087
Her head was dead,
her ass was red,

1988
01:21:42,089 --> 01:21:44,489
the lips on her cunt was cold.

1989
01:21:44,491 --> 01:21:46,508
I figured, what the hell,

1990
01:21:46,509 --> 01:21:48,526
since the bitch ain't well,
I'll get me a wife-in-law.

1991
01:21:48,528 --> 01:21:52,096
Now there's this redhead bitch
with a whorehouse itch

1992
01:21:52,098 --> 01:21:53,897
over in Bernie Willis' stable.

1993
01:21:53,899 --> 01:21:56,483
I call her big mabel,

1994
01:21:56,484 --> 01:21:59,068
do my best while you convalesce,
get back on your feet again.

1995
01:21:59,070 --> 01:22:01,437
"Like hell," she cried.

1996
01:22:01,439 --> 01:22:04,373
"I'll see you dead
before I see you go.

1997
01:22:04,375 --> 01:22:08,610
"May the black coach of sorrow
pick your ass up tomorrow

1998
01:22:08,612 --> 01:22:10,445
"if you walk beyond that door.

1999
01:22:10,447 --> 01:22:13,114
"Now, I ruined my health
and a bid for wealth

2000
01:22:13,116 --> 01:22:14,482
"so that you
could have your bed.

2001
01:22:14,484 --> 01:22:16,650
"But you done went dopehead...

2002
01:22:16,652 --> 01:22:17,917
"shot up all of that bread.

2003
01:22:17,919 --> 01:22:19,518
"Now, you talking
that stable shit?

2004
01:22:19,520 --> 01:22:21,620
"But you see,
I'm wise to the lines

2005
01:22:21,622 --> 01:22:23,521
"that you pimps
drop on the frails

2006
01:22:23,523 --> 01:22:25,189
"and the games you try to play,

2007
01:22:25,191 --> 01:22:29,459
"and if this shit
don't cease like motherfucker,

2008
01:22:29,461 --> 01:22:30,893
"I'm calling the po-lice.

2009
01:22:30,895 --> 01:22:33,629
Have them carry your ass away."

2010
01:22:34,131 --> 01:22:36,598
Well, I just kept on
fixing my shit

2011
01:22:36,600 --> 01:22:38,533
because I was aiming to split.

2012
01:22:38,535 --> 01:22:40,268
This is what I said.

2013
01:22:40,270 --> 01:22:42,069
Mike: What did you say?

2014
01:22:42,071 --> 01:22:45,138
"Bitch, you ain't no lady.

2015
01:22:45,140 --> 01:22:48,908
"You know the game,
but they call it cop and blow.

2016
01:22:48,910 --> 01:22:50,676
"You done had your run,
and now you're done.

2017
01:22:50,678 --> 01:22:52,361
"I'm going to find me
another ho.

2018
01:22:52,362 --> 01:22:54,045
"Now, wouldn't I look silly
with a broke-down filly

2019
01:22:54,048 --> 01:22:55,547
on a track that
was way too fast?"

2020
01:22:55,549 --> 01:22:57,065
Mike: Mm-hmm.

2021
01:22:57,066 --> 01:22:58,582
"Besides, a bitch ain't shit
without a good man's wit,

2022
01:22:58,585 --> 01:23:00,284
"and your thoroughbred
days are past.

2023
01:23:00,286 --> 01:23:03,553
"No, I'll put you in charge
of my whorehouse at large,

2024
01:23:03,555 --> 01:23:04,987
"give some girls the rule.

2025
01:23:04,989 --> 01:23:06,421
"But you sound like hell

2026
01:23:06,423 --> 01:23:08,523
"talking about
putting me in jail,

2027
01:23:08,525 --> 01:23:12,493
"you must be
a goddamn fool, bitch.

2028
01:23:12,495 --> 01:23:15,362
"Step aside. Let me slide.

2029
01:23:15,364 --> 01:23:18,498
Hurry up. Get off my back."

2030
01:23:18,666 --> 01:23:20,499
"I'm going to find me
another young woman

2031
01:23:20,501 --> 01:23:22,133
who can run
the real fast track."

2032
01:23:22,135 --> 01:23:26,103
Now I lean on my back
in another ho's shack

2033
01:23:26,105 --> 01:23:27,504
running down my pedigree.

2034
01:23:27,506 --> 01:23:31,074
We heard a tremendous thunder
that shook the door under,

2035
01:23:31,076 --> 01:23:34,377
and I'm wondering
who in the fuck that could be.

2036
01:23:34,379 --> 01:23:36,679
Just then a policeman walked in

2037
01:23:36,681 --> 01:23:40,683
with a great big grin
fixed in a deadly expression.

2038
01:23:40,685 --> 01:23:44,353
Wants to know,
"your name rock?"

2039
01:23:44,355 --> 01:23:45,554
"Pimping rock."

2040
01:23:45,556 --> 01:23:48,056
"Hurry up.
Sign this confession."

2041
01:23:48,058 --> 01:23:50,391
"That's him," she cried,

2042
01:23:50,393 --> 01:23:52,693
swinging her arms
in the deepest of glee.

2043
01:23:52,695 --> 01:23:56,530
"That's the dirty son of a bitch
with the con man pitch

2044
01:23:56,532 --> 01:23:58,498
that made a stinking ho
out of me."

2045
01:23:58,500 --> 01:24:02,301
Just then, a deadly blow
knocked me to the floor,

2046
01:24:02,303 --> 01:24:05,370
and I fell into a black repose.

2047
01:24:05,372 --> 01:24:09,407
When I awoke, my jaw was broke.

2048
01:24:09,409 --> 01:24:12,009
Blood was all over my clothes.

2049
01:24:12,011 --> 01:24:17,647
And that's the tale that I tell
from my prison cell,

2050
01:24:17,649 --> 01:24:19,615
sitting here on my bed.

2051
01:24:19,617 --> 01:24:23,752
Murder one, possession of a gun,

2052
01:24:23,754 --> 01:24:30,224
and, yeah, I shot that
stinking bitch dead.

2053
01:24:47,609 --> 01:24:49,508
Torch: I'm really sick, Mike.

2054
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:51,710
You got to help me.

2055
01:24:54,114 --> 01:24:57,682
Mike, I'm really
fucking sick, man.

2056
01:24:57,684 --> 01:25:00,151
You got to just let me
have a little taste.

2057
01:25:00,153 --> 01:25:01,336
No way, man.

2058
01:25:01,337 --> 01:25:02,520
No way I can let you
have any of that shit.

2059
01:25:02,522 --> 01:25:03,654
I just need a little bit, man.

2060
01:25:03,656 --> 01:25:05,255
That's all.
I just need a little bit.

2061
01:25:05,257 --> 01:25:06,623
Sorry. You got to
excuse me, bro,

2062
01:25:06,625 --> 01:25:08,324
but I can't let you
do that. All right?

2063
01:25:08,326 --> 01:25:10,659
I'm going to be sick.

2064
01:25:10,661 --> 01:25:13,194
Hey. Come on. Billy?

2065
01:25:13,196 --> 01:25:14,595
Billy.

2066
01:25:14,597 --> 01:25:17,464
You ok? Huh? You ok, bro?

2067
01:25:17,466 --> 01:25:18,665
You all right?

2068
01:25:18,667 --> 01:25:21,300
Oh, shit.

2069
01:25:23,270 --> 01:25:24,419
Shh.

2070
01:25:24,420 --> 01:25:25,569
Motherfucker, let me
have a little bit, man.

2071
01:25:25,572 --> 01:25:26,637
I just need a little bit.

2072
01:25:26,639 --> 01:25:28,505
Come on, man.
I need a little bit.

2073
01:25:28,507 --> 01:25:29,539
Come on.

2074
01:25:29,540 --> 01:25:30,572
I don't fix soon,
I'm going to fucking die.

2075
01:25:30,575 --> 01:25:31,607
Come on. Come on. Come on.

2076
01:25:31,609 --> 01:25:32,641
Don't say that.

2077
01:25:32,643 --> 01:25:33,575
You ain't going to die.

2078
01:25:33,577 --> 01:25:34,642
He's going to wish he was dead

2079
01:25:34,644 --> 01:25:36,143
if he don't get straight.

2080
01:25:36,145 --> 01:25:37,310
It still don't make no sense

2081
01:25:37,312 --> 01:25:39,111
in putting that shit
in his veins, Tony.

2082
01:25:39,113 --> 01:25:40,178
He ain't going to get better

2083
01:25:40,180 --> 01:25:41,913
no time soon without it.

2084
01:25:41,914 --> 01:25:43,647
Torch, when's the last
time you fixed?

2085
01:25:43,650 --> 01:25:44,716
Yesterday.

2086
01:25:44,717 --> 01:25:45,783
Come on, Mike.
I'm fucking sick, man.

2087
01:25:45,785 --> 01:25:46,683
Come on.

2088
01:25:46,685 --> 01:25:47,868
Man, why I got to have

2089
01:25:47,869 --> 01:25:49,052
a dopesick junkie
for a brother?

2090
01:25:49,054 --> 01:25:50,153
Huh?

2091
01:25:50,154 --> 01:25:51,253
You don't want him to be sick?

2092
01:25:51,256 --> 01:25:52,655
Let him fix.

2093
01:25:56,693 --> 01:25:58,142
Ok.

2094
01:25:58,143 --> 01:25:59,592
Ok. Go ahead. <i>Comé mierda.</i>

2095
01:25:59,595 --> 01:26:01,461
Put that fucking
poison in your body.

2096
01:26:01,463 --> 01:26:02,795
Why the fuck should I care?

2097
01:26:02,797 --> 01:26:03,695
Come on.

2098
01:26:03,697 --> 01:26:05,129
Sit over here.

2099
01:26:05,131 --> 01:26:06,230
Thanks, bro.

2100
01:26:06,232 --> 01:26:08,198
Don't call me that.

2101
01:26:08,200 --> 01:26:09,365
Sh...

2102
01:26:09,367 --> 01:26:10,265
I'm sorry, bro.

2103
01:26:10,267 --> 01:26:11,666
Hey, don't call me that.

2104
01:26:11,668 --> 01:26:12,667
Aah! Mike!

2105
01:26:12,669 --> 01:26:13,601
You heard what I said?

2106
01:26:13,603 --> 01:26:14,768
Don't you ever call me that

2107
01:26:14,770 --> 01:26:16,236
as long as you live.

2108
01:26:16,238 --> 01:26:17,403
Aah!

2109
01:26:17,405 --> 01:26:18,838
Mike!

2110
01:26:18,839 --> 01:26:20,272
First my sister.
Now this fucking shit?

2111
01:26:20,275 --> 01:26:21,707
Put your head
out the window, man.

2112
01:26:21,709 --> 01:26:22,691
You need to chill.

2113
01:26:22,692 --> 01:26:23,674
You're only
my half brother anyway.

2114
01:26:23,677 --> 01:26:24,943
I don't even know why

2115
01:26:24,944 --> 01:26:26,210
I thought that shit
meant anything to me.

2116
01:26:26,212 --> 01:26:28,578
Get the fuck out.

2117
01:26:31,516 --> 01:26:32,581
Fuck.

2118
01:26:32,583 --> 01:26:33,882
You got your works, baby?

2119
01:26:33,884 --> 01:26:35,750
Yeah, in my jacket.

2120
01:26:36,652 --> 01:26:38,351
All right.

2121
01:26:58,839 --> 01:27:01,206
Fuck.

2122
01:27:02,742 --> 01:27:05,275
You guys got to help me, man.

2123
01:27:05,277 --> 01:27:07,343
My hand don't work no more.

2124
01:27:07,345 --> 01:27:09,378
I can't do this one by myself.

2125
01:27:09,380 --> 01:27:11,780
Don't you even
fucking look at me.

2126
01:27:11,782 --> 01:27:13,381
I hope that shit kills you.

2127
01:27:13,383 --> 01:27:15,449
Don't say that.

2128
01:27:18,720 --> 01:27:20,786
I got it, baby.

2129
01:27:21,655 --> 01:27:22,587
What you need?

2130
01:27:22,589 --> 01:27:23,588
I just need you

2131
01:27:23,590 --> 01:27:26,290
to hook it up for me.

2132
01:27:26,292 --> 01:27:28,492
Ok.

2133
01:27:38,336 --> 01:27:39,268
Like this?

2134
01:27:39,270 --> 01:27:40,802
Yeah, that's good.

2135
01:27:48,944 --> 01:27:50,944
Hey, Tony, man...

2136
01:27:52,647 --> 01:27:54,346
Thanks.

2137
01:27:54,348 --> 01:27:56,281
No problem.

2138
01:28:00,453 --> 01:28:01,718
I'm sorry about
throwing up on you.

2139
01:28:01,720 --> 01:28:04,587
It's just when I get
sick like this,

2140
01:28:04,589 --> 01:28:06,422
I can't help myself.

2141
01:28:08,592 --> 01:28:09,591
And you, too, Mike.

2142
01:28:09,593 --> 01:28:11,693
I'm sorry about
pissing my pants

2143
01:28:11,695 --> 01:28:13,528
in front of your
friend here, man.

2144
01:28:13,530 --> 01:28:14,629
Hope I didn't embarrass you.

2145
01:28:14,631 --> 01:28:16,263
It's just when I get sick,

2146
01:28:16,265 --> 01:28:17,764
I can't help...

2147
01:28:45,927 --> 01:28:46,859
Torch: Come on, man.

2148
01:28:46,861 --> 01:28:47,993
Don't look at me like that.

2149
01:28:47,995 --> 01:28:49,627
I hate it when people

2150
01:28:49,629 --> 01:28:51,462
look at me like that.

2151
01:28:52,698 --> 01:28:55,632
Don't fucking look
at me like that.

2152
01:28:55,634 --> 01:28:58,034
What you do that
shit for anyway, man?

2153
01:28:58,036 --> 01:28:58,834
I don't know.

2154
01:28:58,836 --> 01:29:00,635
Because it's all I got.

2155
01:29:00,637 --> 01:29:01,636
That's bullshit.

2156
01:29:01,638 --> 01:29:03,537
No, it's not bullshit.

2157
01:29:03,539 --> 01:29:04,671
It's not bullshit.

2158
01:29:04,673 --> 01:29:06,572
You are bullshit, man.

2159
01:29:06,574 --> 01:29:07,639
You're bullshit.

2160
01:29:07,641 --> 01:29:08,973
Oh, no, I almost forgot,

2161
01:29:08,975 --> 01:29:10,708
you're my long lost
half brother, right?

2162
01:29:10,710 --> 01:29:13,343
You tell me, what
else have I got?

2163
01:29:13,345 --> 01:29:15,645
I got no real family.

2164
01:29:15,647 --> 01:29:16,812
Got no job.

2165
01:29:16,814 --> 01:29:18,914
Ain't been able to keep one

2166
01:29:18,916 --> 01:29:19,832
the past 5 years.

2167
01:29:19,833 --> 01:29:20,749
Last job I had, I missed

2168
01:29:20,751 --> 01:29:22,417
so many workdays
from being sick,

2169
01:29:22,419 --> 01:29:23,501
I said "fuck it."

2170
01:29:23,502 --> 01:29:24,584
Started stealing full-time

2171
01:29:24,587 --> 01:29:25,586
to support my habit.

2172
01:29:25,588 --> 01:29:26,720
It's part of the reason

2173
01:29:26,722 --> 01:29:28,855
I started hitting
myself in the feet.

2174
01:29:28,857 --> 01:29:30,756
This way, I don't
got to walk around

2175
01:29:30,758 --> 01:29:31,790
wearing long sleeves
all the time.

2176
01:29:31,792 --> 01:29:33,424
Sure, you know, it gets messy...

2177
01:29:33,426 --> 01:29:34,408
walking around,

2178
01:29:34,409 --> 01:29:35,391
blood dripping
out of your shoe.

2179
01:29:35,394 --> 01:29:36,926
It's easy to hide.

2180
01:29:37,595 --> 01:29:38,760
You want to know why, Mike?

2181
01:29:38,762 --> 01:29:40,528
You really want to know why

2182
01:29:40,530 --> 01:29:41,629
I shoot dope?

2183
01:29:41,631 --> 01:29:42,796
Because I have to.

2184
01:29:42,798 --> 01:29:44,531
The colds, they come.

2185
01:29:44,533 --> 01:29:45,665
I don't, I get sick.

2186
01:29:45,667 --> 01:29:48,000
You ever been sick?

2187
01:29:48,002 --> 01:29:49,768
So fucking sick your
whole body aches,

2188
01:29:49,770 --> 01:29:51,536
your guts feel like
it's on fire,

2189
01:29:51,538 --> 01:29:52,520
your blood's boiling?

2190
01:29:52,521 --> 01:29:53,503
There's not a fucking thing

2191
01:29:53,506 --> 01:29:54,605
in the whole wide world

2192
01:29:54,607 --> 01:29:55,689
you can do about it.

2193
01:29:55,690 --> 01:29:56,772
It's not a good feeling, bro.

2194
01:29:56,775 --> 01:29:58,374
Stop looking at me like that.

2195
01:29:58,376 --> 01:30:00,743
20/20 my ass.

2196
01:30:00,745 --> 01:30:02,511
Yeah, you got eyes

2197
01:30:02,513 --> 01:30:03,712
in the back of your head.

2198
01:30:03,714 --> 01:30:04,879
You got any idea what it's like

2199
01:30:04,881 --> 01:30:06,113
to want to quit and
know that you can't?

2200
01:30:06,115 --> 01:30:08,081
Like you really,
really want to quit,

2201
01:30:08,083 --> 01:30:09,766
but you just can't?

2202
01:30:09,767 --> 01:30:11,450
Like in the past 5 years alone,

2203
01:30:11,453 --> 01:30:13,419
I tried to kick
3 different times.

2204
01:30:13,421 --> 01:30:15,721
Cold Turkey the first time.

2205
01:30:15,723 --> 01:30:17,622
Next two times,

2206
01:30:17,624 --> 01:30:19,490
tried a 10-day
methadone program

2207
01:30:19,492 --> 01:30:20,757
they got over in Brooklyn.

2208
01:30:20,759 --> 01:30:22,592
I had 7 out of 10 days clean

2209
01:30:22,594 --> 01:30:23,759
on my first go-around.

2210
01:30:23,761 --> 01:30:26,728
Big fucking deal, right?

2211
01:30:29,432 --> 01:30:32,366
Next time, two years later,

2212
01:30:32,368 --> 01:30:35,435
on the 11th day,
my girlfriend pattie

2213
01:30:35,437 --> 01:30:36,436
came to pick me up.

2214
01:30:36,438 --> 01:30:38,838
Off we went to cup.

2215
01:30:39,073 --> 01:30:40,806
I had 11 days clean,

2216
01:30:40,808 --> 01:30:43,008
$60 in my pocket.

2217
01:30:43,010 --> 01:30:45,543
Bought 5 bags of dope,

2218
01:30:45,545 --> 01:30:46,477
a pack of cigarettes.

2219
01:30:46,479 --> 01:30:50,447
Shot them up just like...

2220
01:31:14,606 --> 01:31:17,006
I remember the high
I got from that shit

2221
01:31:17,008 --> 01:31:19,475
like it was yesterday.

2222
01:31:27,784 --> 01:31:31,886
Felt like superman.

2223
01:31:31,888 --> 01:31:34,654
Invincible, you know?

2224
01:31:37,959 --> 01:31:40,092
Here I come, man...

2225
01:31:40,094 --> 01:31:42,627
Looking at you with those eyes.

2226
01:31:42,629 --> 01:31:44,595
Only it wasn't your face

2227
01:31:44,597 --> 01:31:45,662
I'd be looking at.

2228
01:31:45,664 --> 01:31:46,696
It was my own.

2229
01:31:46,698 --> 01:31:49,165
I'd be staring in the mirror,

2230
01:31:49,167 --> 01:31:49,999
begging and crying

2231
01:31:50,001 --> 01:31:51,600
for him to let me stop,

2232
01:31:51,602 --> 01:31:52,851
but he wouldn't.

2233
01:31:52,852 --> 01:31:54,101
Just kept staring back at me

2234
01:31:54,104 --> 01:31:55,770
with this look on his face

2235
01:31:55,772 --> 01:31:56,988
that's saying,

2236
01:31:56,989 --> 01:31:58,205
"who's that crazy
strung-out junkie

2237
01:31:58,207 --> 01:31:59,456
"looking at me?

2238
01:31:59,457 --> 01:32:00,706
"Can't be who I think it is.

2239
01:32:00,709 --> 01:32:02,575
"I don't look like that, do I?

2240
01:32:02,577 --> 01:32:04,743
"This guy looks dangerous.

2241
01:32:04,745 --> 01:32:06,611
"Too dangerous to be
on the street.

2242
01:32:06,613 --> 01:32:08,779
Too dangerous to be me."

2243
01:32:08,781 --> 01:32:10,647
But it is you.

2244
01:32:10,649 --> 01:32:12,882
It's you exactly
the way you are,

2245
01:32:12,884 --> 01:32:13,782
sure as shit.

2246
01:32:13,784 --> 01:32:15,950
What scares you the most is,

2247
01:32:15,952 --> 01:32:17,017
that's what people see

2248
01:32:17,019 --> 01:32:18,585
when they look at you

2249
01:32:18,587 --> 01:32:21,487
the way you look at me.

2250
01:32:30,964 --> 01:32:33,130
Whoa.

2251
01:32:34,833 --> 01:32:36,999
Mike?

2252
01:32:37,001 --> 01:32:41,069
I'm not feeling too good, man.

2253
01:32:45,508 --> 01:32:48,975
Mike: Billy, stop
fucking around, man.

2254
01:32:52,246 --> 01:32:54,012
Billy?

2255
01:32:55,215 --> 01:32:56,681
Billy?

2256
01:33:00,118 --> 01:33:03,919
Ok, um...

2257
01:33:03,921 --> 01:33:05,938
Ok.

2258
01:33:05,939 --> 01:33:07,956
I got to pick
you up. All right?

2259
01:33:09,592 --> 01:33:11,491
We're going to walk,
Billy. Come on.

2260
01:33:11,493 --> 01:33:13,693
Going to walk with me, bro?

2261
01:33:13,695 --> 01:33:15,828
That's it, huh? Come on.

2262
01:33:20,601 --> 01:33:22,634
What's the difference
between the police

2263
01:33:22,636 --> 01:33:24,602
and the po-lice?

2264
01:33:24,604 --> 01:33:25,970
No idea.

2265
01:33:25,972 --> 01:33:28,639
Well, obviously you've never

2266
01:33:28,641 --> 01:33:30,641
been chased by them.

2267
01:33:32,578 --> 01:33:34,778
Come on, Billy.

2268
01:33:35,580 --> 01:33:36,812
Come on.

2269
01:33:36,814 --> 01:33:38,780
Come on, Mike. Look at you.

2270
01:33:38,782 --> 01:33:40,848
What you look like, man?

2271
01:33:40,850 --> 01:33:43,984
Tony, you're supposed
to be helping me, man.

2272
01:33:43,986 --> 01:33:45,819
Oh, I'm supposed
to be helping you?

2273
01:33:45,821 --> 01:33:47,687
Ain't that a bitch?

2274
01:33:47,689 --> 01:33:49,055
Don't move, Billy.

2275
01:33:49,057 --> 01:33:51,090
You stay right there.

2276
01:33:51,092 --> 01:33:52,926
I'm going to fix you up, ok?

2277
01:33:52,928 --> 01:33:54,827
We're going to fix you up.

2278
01:33:54,829 --> 01:33:55,828
Ok.

2279
01:33:55,830 --> 01:33:58,163
Come on. Don't be dead.

2280
01:33:58,732 --> 01:33:59,764
Come on. Don't be dead.

2281
01:33:59,766 --> 01:34:01,031
Don't be dead, ok?

2282
01:34:01,033 --> 01:34:03,733
Billy, Billy,
don't be dead, ok?

2283
01:34:03,735 --> 01:34:05,468
Come on.

2284
01:34:05,469 --> 01:34:07,202
It's supposed to be my dope.

2285
01:34:12,676 --> 01:34:13,374
Yeah.

2286
01:34:13,376 --> 01:34:14,908
The dope you stole?

2287
01:34:14,910 --> 01:34:16,242
Mine.

2288
01:34:16,244 --> 01:34:17,460
But you said...

2289
01:34:17,461 --> 01:34:18,677
you said you
was out of the life.

2290
01:34:18,679 --> 01:34:20,262
Oh, come on, Mike.

2291
01:34:20,263 --> 01:34:21,846
Once in the life,
always in the life.

2292
01:34:21,848 --> 01:34:23,747
You know the game.

2293
01:34:24,382 --> 01:34:28,684
Hey, Tony. Look, uh,

2294
01:34:28,686 --> 01:34:31,253
I need you to help me now.

2295
01:34:31,255 --> 01:34:32,287
Ok?

2296
01:34:32,289 --> 01:34:34,255
I want to, Mike.

2297
01:34:34,257 --> 01:34:36,323
I really do.

2298
01:34:36,325 --> 01:34:39,759
Besides killing you myself...

2299
01:34:40,728 --> 01:34:43,961
I can't do nothing
for you, baby.

2300
01:34:47,333 --> 01:34:48,932
You going to kill me, man?

2301
01:34:48,934 --> 01:34:50,700
I don't know, man.

2302
01:34:50,702 --> 01:34:52,802
You don't know?

2303
01:34:52,804 --> 01:34:53,969
You don't know?

2304
01:34:53,971 --> 01:34:54,903
Come on, man.

2305
01:34:54,905 --> 01:34:55,854
You just now said

2306
01:34:55,855 --> 01:34:56,804
you was going to kill me.

2307
01:34:56,806 --> 01:34:58,071
Me... godfather
to your firstborn.

2308
01:34:58,073 --> 01:34:59,072
You remember me?

2309
01:34:59,074 --> 01:35:00,073
Too much crime,

2310
01:35:00,075 --> 01:35:03,810
too much time like this, yo.

2311
01:35:03,812 --> 01:35:05,144
Now you standing
there telling me

2312
01:35:05,146 --> 01:35:06,712
that all that shit don't count?

2313
01:35:06,714 --> 01:35:07,713
Like it don't mean nothing?

2314
01:35:07,715 --> 01:35:08,814
Like, what, all of a sudden

2315
01:35:08,816 --> 01:35:09,981
I'm... I'm... I'm
a fucking stranger?

2316
01:35:09,983 --> 01:35:11,248
I don't mean shit
to you no more?

2317
01:35:11,250 --> 01:35:12,349
I can't believe that, man.

2318
01:35:12,351 --> 01:35:14,250
I mean, I know a lot of shit

2319
01:35:14,252 --> 01:35:15,684
can happen in 2 or 3 years.

2320
01:35:15,686 --> 01:35:16,918
You know, people change.

2321
01:35:16,920 --> 01:35:18,542
But, Tony, yo,

2322
01:35:18,543 --> 01:35:20,165
what the fuck happened to you?

2323
01:35:20,166 --> 01:35:21,788
The fucking world
happened to me, Mike.

2324
01:35:21,791 --> 01:35:23,357
I got a criminal record, Mike.

2325
01:35:23,359 --> 01:35:25,792
The world don't want
no parts of me.

2326
01:35:25,794 --> 01:35:27,059
It don't give a fuck about me.

2327
01:35:27,061 --> 01:35:30,929
It don't owe me shit.
Not a goddamn thing.

2328
01:35:30,931 --> 01:35:33,865
So I did what
I had to do, Mike.

2329
01:35:33,867 --> 01:35:36,100
Now I don't owe nobody nothing.

2330
01:35:36,102 --> 01:35:37,968
Yeah, nobody but Manny.

2331
01:35:37,970 --> 01:35:39,553
You owe him.

2332
01:35:39,554 --> 01:35:41,137
The motherfucker owns you.

2333
01:35:41,139 --> 01:35:42,805
No, motherfucker. Oh?

2334
01:35:42,807 --> 01:35:44,290
You own me.

2335
01:35:44,291 --> 01:35:45,774
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
about the dope, man.

2336
01:35:45,776 --> 01:35:47,008
I didn't know it
was yours, you know?

2337
01:35:47,010 --> 01:35:48,376
Talk to Manny. Maybe...

2338
01:35:48,378 --> 01:35:49,727
Manny ain't interested

2339
01:35:49,728 --> 01:35:51,077
in no conversations
about nothing.

2340
01:35:51,080 --> 01:35:53,713
Take a look
out the window, Mike.

2341
01:35:53,715 --> 01:35:55,715
Go ahead. Take a look
out the window.

2342
01:35:55,717 --> 01:35:57,783
This ain't no flimflam.

2343
01:35:57,785 --> 01:35:59,484
This ain't no
riker's fucking island.

2344
01:35:59,486 --> 01:36:00,751
This is the life, Mike.

2345
01:36:00,753 --> 01:36:02,385
What do you think
they're going to do

2346
01:36:02,387 --> 01:36:03,486
to me when I don't
come through?

2347
01:36:03,488 --> 01:36:05,187
What do you think
they're going to do

2348
01:36:05,189 --> 01:36:07,289
to Maxine, my little girl?

2349
01:36:07,291 --> 01:36:09,124
They got Max?

2350
01:36:09,126 --> 01:36:10,725
They got precious?

2351
01:36:10,727 --> 01:36:11,793
I'm sorry, Tony, man.

2352
01:36:11,794 --> 01:36:12,860
I didn't mean to put
you in no shit.

2353
01:36:12,862 --> 01:36:15,395
You are so fucking
full of shit, Mike.

2354
01:36:15,397 --> 01:36:17,096
I just thought that I could...

2355
01:36:17,098 --> 01:36:18,230
you thought?

2356
01:36:18,232 --> 01:36:19,464
You thought what?

2357
01:36:19,466 --> 01:36:21,165
That you could be Manny?

2358
01:36:21,167 --> 01:36:23,800
That you could
trust nine lives?

2359
01:36:23,802 --> 01:36:25,101
You see, that's your problem

2360
01:36:25,103 --> 01:36:27,103
right there, Mike.

2361
01:36:27,104 --> 01:36:29,104
You don't think.
You never fucking did.

2362
01:36:29,107 --> 01:36:30,739
20/20 Mike.

2363
01:36:30,741 --> 01:36:31,873
You walk around like

2364
01:36:31,875 --> 01:36:34,175
a fucking blind man, man.

2365
01:36:36,179 --> 01:36:38,746
I ain't ready
to die today, Tony.

2366
01:36:38,748 --> 01:36:42,049
Brother, I ain't ready
to die for you.

2367
01:36:42,051 --> 01:36:43,483
Ok.

2368
01:36:43,485 --> 01:36:46,519
Ok, I'll make a deal
with you then.

2369
01:36:46,521 --> 01:36:48,053
Fuck a deal.

2370
01:36:48,055 --> 01:36:49,354
Come on, man.

2371
01:36:49,356 --> 01:36:50,855
Look, I'm going
to go downstairs

2372
01:36:50,857 --> 01:36:51,939
like you said. I just...

2373
01:36:51,940 --> 01:36:53,022
ok, I'm going to go
downstairs. I'm...

2374
01:36:53,025 --> 01:36:54,124
shut the fuck up, Mike.

2375
01:36:54,126 --> 01:36:55,125
I ain't trying to hear you.

2376
01:36:55,127 --> 01:36:56,960
I need you to stall
them for me.

2377
01:36:56,962 --> 01:36:58,761
I ain't trying
to hear you, Mike.

2378
01:36:58,763 --> 01:36:59,495
Listen to me.

2379
01:36:59,497 --> 01:37:00,830
I'm going to go downstairs

2380
01:37:00,831 --> 01:37:02,164
like you said, but
I'm going to try...

2381
01:37:02,166 --> 01:37:03,265
fuck that, Mike.

2382
01:37:03,266 --> 01:37:04,365
Get your fucking ass in here.

2383
01:37:04,366 --> 01:37:05,465
I'm going to try
and make it. I just...

2384
01:37:05,469 --> 01:37:06,935
I'm going to make it.
I'm going to...

2385
01:37:06,937 --> 01:37:08,069
get that fucking hand down.

2386
01:37:08,071 --> 01:37:09,370
Tony, I'm begging you.

2387
01:37:10,873 --> 01:37:12,373
I'm begging you, man.
Please don't kill me, all right?

2388
01:37:12,374 --> 01:37:13,874
Tony, I'm begging you.
I'm begging you, please.

2389
01:37:13,876 --> 01:37:14,975
Please don't kill me, Tony.

2390
01:37:14,977 --> 01:37:17,211
Tony. Tony, don't kill me.

2391
01:37:17,212 --> 01:37:19,446
<i>No me mates,</i> man. <i>No me mates.</i>

2392
01:37:19,448 --> 01:37:20,413
Tony.

2393
01:37:20,415 --> 01:37:22,848
Get up.

2394
01:37:22,850 --> 01:37:23,915
Huh?

2395
01:37:23,917 --> 01:37:26,550
Get the fuck up, Mike.

2396
01:37:30,956 --> 01:37:33,256
I don't even know
why I'm doing this,

2397
01:37:33,258 --> 01:37:34,090
but...

2398
01:37:34,092 --> 01:37:35,558
Because I'm your boy.

2399
01:37:35,560 --> 01:37:37,059
Too much crime,

2400
01:37:37,061 --> 01:37:38,493
too much time. Too much time.

2401
01:37:38,495 --> 01:37:40,094
Mike...

2402
01:37:40,096 --> 01:37:40,994
What the fuck

2403
01:37:40,996 --> 01:37:42,795
am I going to say to Manny?

2404
01:37:42,797 --> 01:37:43,946
Hey, hey. Come on. Come on.

2405
01:37:43,947 --> 01:37:45,096
Come on, Tony.
You'll think of something.

2406
01:37:45,099 --> 01:37:46,531
You'll think of something, man.

2407
01:37:46,533 --> 01:37:47,682
You're smart.

2408
01:37:47,683 --> 01:37:48,832
Are we going
to do this? Mm-hmm?

2409
01:37:48,835 --> 01:37:50,568
We're going to do
this right now, Mike.

2410
01:37:50,570 --> 01:37:52,570
Ok. Ok. Do-or-die time, right?

2411
01:37:52,572 --> 01:37:53,904
Right. Ok.

2412
01:37:53,906 --> 01:37:55,906
Do-or-die time.

2413
01:37:56,508 --> 01:37:57,940
In all these years
I've known you,

2414
01:37:57,942 --> 01:37:59,908
you ain't never
laughed at my shit,

2415
01:37:59,910 --> 01:38:01,943
and my shit is funny.

2416
01:38:01,945 --> 01:38:03,311
According to you.

2417
01:38:03,313 --> 01:38:05,813
That... that police, po-lice...

2418
01:38:05,815 --> 01:38:07,181
That's funny shit.

2419
01:38:07,183 --> 01:38:10,017
Then why didn't I laugh?

2420
01:38:10,285 --> 01:38:14,853
You know, there's
funny, and there's...

2421
01:38:14,855 --> 01:38:15,520
You.

2422
01:38:15,522 --> 01:38:17,188
Oh, man.

2423
01:38:17,190 --> 01:38:18,522
Yo, Mike.

2424
01:38:20,526 --> 01:38:22,425
Take care of yourself, man.

2425
01:38:22,427 --> 01:38:23,660
Hell, yeah.

2426
01:38:23,661 --> 01:38:24,894
Listen, Tony, you give precious

2427
01:38:24,896 --> 01:38:27,496
a big hug from Uncle Mikey, ok?

2428
01:38:27,498 --> 01:38:29,030
Yeah.

2429
01:38:40,309 --> 01:38:41,541
He was not funny. I'm funny.

2430
01:38:41,543 --> 01:38:44,176
Are... are we being
a little sensitive?

2431
01:38:44,178 --> 01:38:45,010
No.

2432
01:38:45,012 --> 01:38:46,178
Come on, now.

2433
01:38:46,179 --> 01:38:47,345
Did he hurt your
feelings, ruffy?

2434
01:38:47,347 --> 01:38:49,380
You hurt my feelings.

2435
01:38:49,382 --> 01:38:50,214
I'm funny.

2436
01:38:50,216 --> 01:38:52,849
You got a... please.

2437
01:39:04,428 --> 01:39:07,562
That shit was funny,
what I said.

2438
01:39:32,020 --> 01:39:36,922
Come on, motherfucker.
Answer the phone.

2439
01:39:52,337 --> 01:39:54,537
All right.

2440
01:40:31,408 --> 01:40:32,707
Mike: Oh, shit!

2441
01:40:32,709 --> 01:40:34,341
Mike?

2442
01:40:34,343 --> 01:40:35,408
Yeah?

2443
01:40:35,410 --> 01:40:36,475
You all right?

2444
01:40:36,477 --> 01:40:38,176
Yeah, yeah. I'm ok.

2445
01:40:38,178 --> 01:40:39,610
What happened?

2446
01:40:39,612 --> 01:40:43,646
I thought I saw
a fucking rat, man.

2447
01:40:46,283 --> 01:40:51,018
All aboard for the night train.

2448
01:40:51,220 --> 01:40:52,652
Mike, it's do-or-die time, man.

2449
01:40:52,654 --> 01:40:54,453
What are you going to do?

2450
01:40:54,455 --> 01:40:55,520
I'm going to try to go out

2451
01:40:55,522 --> 01:40:57,688
a back window on another floor.

2452
01:41:03,295 --> 01:41:06,129
Hold up a minute, Mike.

2453
01:41:07,599 --> 01:41:10,566
You almost forgot
your piece, man.

2454
01:41:20,577 --> 01:41:22,476
Tony.

2455
01:41:29,985 --> 01:41:31,484
Thanks a lot, bro.

2456
01:41:31,486 --> 01:41:33,352
Goddamn, man.

2457
01:41:38,258 --> 01:41:39,857
Tony.

2458
01:41:40,659 --> 01:41:43,726
Take that with you, baby.

2459
01:42:11,788 --> 01:42:14,255
Knock knock.

2460
01:42:18,761 --> 01:42:21,561
Oh, isn't that precious?

2461
01:42:28,770 --> 01:42:30,736
First degree, baby.

2462
01:42:31,839 --> 01:42:34,272
First degree.

2463
01:43:11,710 --> 01:43:13,710
Tony on cell phone: Manny.

2464
01:43:13,712 --> 01:43:15,178
Tony. You got it?

2465
01:43:15,180 --> 01:43:16,379
Yeah. I got it.

2466
01:43:16,381 --> 01:43:17,580
All of it?

2467
01:43:17,582 --> 01:43:19,381
I said it's done.

2468
01:43:19,383 --> 01:43:21,816
Very nice, Tony.

2469
01:44:23,846 --> 01:44:26,613
Tony, voice-over:
And that's the tale that I tell

2470
01:44:26,615 --> 01:44:28,748
from my prison cell,

2471
01:44:28,750 --> 01:44:30,783
sitting here on my bed.

2472
01:44:30,785 --> 01:44:32,918
Murder one,

2473
01:44:32,920 --> 01:44:34,686
