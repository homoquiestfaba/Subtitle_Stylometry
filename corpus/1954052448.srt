00:00:05,365 --> 00:00:07,603
<i>... we continue our series
this morning called...</i>

3
00:00:08,223 --> 00:00:09,407
Okay, Zack. Belly up.

4
00:00:12,356 --> 00:00:13,670
- Morning.
- Put me down.

5
00:00:14,677 --> 00:00:16,217
- Pancakes?
- No, thanks.

6
00:00:16,633 --> 00:00:18,016
- How did you sleep?
- Good, you?

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:19,372
No, I tossed and turned.

8
00:00:19,522 --> 00:00:21,356
It may be the mayor story
stressing you out.

9
00:00:21,492 --> 00:00:23,403
The stories don't stress me out.

10
00:00:23,525 --> 00:00:25,609
Deadlines? Maybe.

11
00:00:26,689 --> 00:00:29,160
There's been an accident on Van Ness,
you wanna take Corero.

12
00:00:29,531 --> 00:00:30,715
Great, thanks.

13
00:00:31,722 --> 00:00:33,948
And Katie?
Happy anniversary.

14
00:00:34,209 --> 00:00:36,044
Happy aniversary to you, Mr. Vasser.

15
00:00:37,034 --> 00:00:38,103
You thought I forgot.

16
00:00:38,226 --> 00:00:39,917
- Never crossed my mind!
- Yeah, you did.

17
00:00:40,906 --> 00:00:42,859
- Bye, Dad!
- Take care. I'll see you tonight.

18
00:00:42,979 --> 00:00:43,979
Come here, you.

19
00:00:44,127 --> 00:00:45,139
- And Katie?
- Yeah?

20
00:00:45,724 --> 00:00:46,754
Try not to be late.

21
00:00:47,098 --> 00:00:48,098
That's funny.

22
00:00:48,767 --> 00:00:49,940
Your Dad's a funny guy.

23
00:00:56,353 --> 00:00:57,353
Vasser!

24
00:00:57,727 --> 00:00:59,118
- Where is it?
- You're the one

25
00:00:59,255 --> 00:01:01,006
who's all anal
about getting two sources.

26
00:01:01,157 --> 00:01:02,691
That's the mayor, we have to nail him.

27
00:01:02,813 --> 00:01:04,196
It's the age of the blog, Hugh.

28
00:01:04,318 --> 00:01:06,386
You get the story first,
you get it right second.

29
00:01:06,508 --> 00:01:08,056
Well, lately we've done neither.

30
00:01:08,178 --> 00:01:10,437
- I'm pushing it to tomorrow.
- Hugh, come on!

31
00:01:10,559 --> 00:01:12,884
Don't you have
a wedding aniversary tonight?

32
00:01:14,567 --> 00:01:17,152
- I forgot to pick up her ring.
- I've seen this movie before.

33
00:01:17,317 --> 00:01:19,738
I don't need you
when it comes to my marriage.

34
00:01:19,875 --> 00:01:20,875
Yes, you do.

35
00:01:21,138 --> 00:01:22,178
Yeah, you're right.

36
00:01:22,315 --> 00:01:25,369
You got an aspirine?
I got a killer headache coming on.

37
00:01:26,778 --> 00:01:27,778
Taxi!

38
00:01:31,092 --> 00:01:33,541
North Beach, Luna restaurant.
Thanks.

39
00:02:02,893 --> 00:02:03,919
What's going on?

40
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:07,142
Come on, you idiot!
Owens made an amazing catch.

41
00:02:07,264 --> 00:02:08,783
That game was eight years ago.

42
00:02:09,016 --> 00:02:10,972
Dude, I'm gonna have to cut you off.

43
00:02:30,602 --> 00:02:31,602
Livia!

44
00:02:53,095 --> 00:02:54,436
How long have you been in here?

45
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,897
- I don't know.
- This ain't no Bed & Breakfast.

46
00:02:59,143 --> 00:03:00,279
Do you want a ride?

47
00:03:01,332 --> 00:03:02,728
Yeah, Luna restaurant.

48
00:03:10,453 --> 00:03:12,314
I know...

49
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:14,079
Champagne, please.

50
00:03:18,248 --> 00:03:19,617
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

51
00:03:19,739 --> 00:03:22,366
Now, if it was our anniversary...
Wait, it is.

52
00:03:24,524 --> 00:03:26,441
Maybe we should skip dinner.

53
00:03:26,563 --> 00:03:29,464
Bad idea.
You'll need your energy for later.

54
00:03:30,764 --> 00:03:33,424
<i>... and then, Like-a-Mink...</i>

55
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:34,846
Sir, your table's ready.

56
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:36,665
A friend of mine had the winning horse.

57
00:03:37,158 --> 00:03:39,060
A friend of mine had the loser?

58
00:03:39,744 --> 00:03:40,921
Are you all right?

59
00:03:42,569 --> 00:03:44,581
Kind of fell asleep in the cab,
I had this...

60
00:03:44,936 --> 00:03:46,250
weird dream.

61
00:03:47,186 --> 00:03:50,101
- It all took place in here.
- Really?

62
00:03:51,168 --> 00:03:52,565
The last day I saw Livia,

63
00:03:52,687 --> 00:03:55,576
I couldn't take her to the airport,
she took a cab.

64
00:03:57,580 --> 00:03:58,592
I'm sorry.

65
00:03:58,729 --> 00:04:00,345
- It's okay.
- Look at you.

66
00:04:00,467 --> 00:04:02,410
Is there such a thing
as too beautiful?

67
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:03,545
You're good.

68
00:04:04,038 --> 00:04:05,051
Happy aniversary.

69
00:04:06,391 --> 00:04:07,596
They said it wouldn't last.

70
00:04:07,947 --> 00:04:09,234
Here's to getting it wrong.

71
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:18,741
- How you doing?
- Good.

72
00:04:21,874 --> 00:04:23,647
What number
are you gonna play for recital?

73
00:04:23,784 --> 00:04:25,042
It's a song, not a number.

74
00:04:25,452 --> 00:04:26,486
You ready?

75
00:04:26,608 --> 00:04:27,621
I think so.

76
00:04:27,762 --> 00:04:30,746
You're gonna do great. Now remember,
practice + confidence = ...

77
00:04:30,868 --> 00:04:32,140
- Success.
- Very good.

78
00:04:33,591 --> 00:04:34,603
You're gonna be there?

79
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:37,651
Count on it.

80
00:04:47,626 --> 00:04:49,172
That looks expensive.

81
00:04:49,295 --> 00:04:51,101
It has extended us quite a bit, yes.

82
00:04:51,393 --> 00:04:54,567
Well, open yours first,
I'm not following a velvet box.

83
00:04:55,347 --> 00:04:58,037
I'm in the process
of upgrading your wedding ring,

84
00:04:58,159 --> 00:05:00,831
- this will have to hold you.
- <i>You</i> stole my wedding ring.

85
00:05:00,951 --> 00:05:04,118
- You filled out an insurance claim.
- I didn't mail it.

86
00:05:17,119 --> 00:05:18,843
I'd better be in my A game.

87
00:05:19,814 --> 00:05:21,251
That may not be enough.

88
00:06:09,373 --> 00:06:11,316
Get off!

89
00:06:14,832 --> 00:06:15,995
Where am I?

90
00:06:16,844 --> 00:06:17,966
Golden Gate Park.

91
00:06:19,496 --> 00:06:21,247
Someone had fun last night.

92
00:06:22,725 --> 00:06:25,626
Let's go, people. Get up!
You know the drill.

93
00:06:25,858 --> 00:06:27,008
Get up, now!

94
00:06:57,551 --> 00:06:58,551
Katie?

95
00:07:04,081 --> 00:07:05,932
<i>Good morning and welcome to Today,</i>

96
00:07:06,052 --> 00:07:07,998
<i>some of us got back from China
a little slower</i>

97
00:07:08,118 --> 00:07:10,242
<i>but all are present,
including Willard Scott, </i>

98
00:07:10,362 --> 00:07:12,325
<i>who's going to be stepping in
with the weather.</i>

99
00:07:12,445 --> 00:07:15,293
<i>John Palmer will give us details
on those NFL strike talk</i>

100
00:07:15,415 --> 00:07:16,597
<i>the rest of the day's news...</i>

101
00:07:16,717 --> 00:07:19,469
<i>And then after weeks of hearings,
the Senate Judiciary Committee</i>

102
00:07:19,591 --> 00:07:22,560
<i>has scheduled a vote today
on the nomination of Judge Walter...</i>

103
00:07:42,635 --> 00:07:43,635
Get out of my house.

104
00:07:43,771 --> 00:07:45,528
- Get out of my head.
- What do you want?

105
00:07:45,911 --> 00:07:47,006
Waking up would be nice.

106
00:07:47,188 --> 00:07:49,487
Wake your ass up,
I'll knock you into next week.

107
00:07:51,703 --> 00:07:52,716
Yeah, okay. Good.

108
00:07:53,154 --> 00:07:55,521
- Good, do it.
- No, just leave.

109
00:08:00,698 --> 00:08:01,861
That didn't work.

110
00:08:03,174 --> 00:08:04,187
Take the shoes.

111
00:08:04,761 --> 00:08:05,774
Just get out of here.

112
00:08:10,070 --> 00:08:11,164
What's today's date?

113
00:08:11,753 --> 00:08:12,753
October 6th.

114
00:08:13,149 --> 00:08:14,149
What year?

115
00:08:14,927 --> 00:08:15,960
1987.

116
00:08:40,628 --> 00:08:41,709
Sorry to bother you.

117
00:08:42,499 --> 00:08:44,538
- What are you doing here?
- I can't find Dan.

118
00:08:44,758 --> 00:08:46,852
- When was the last time you saw him?
- Last night.

119
00:08:46,975 --> 00:08:48,794
I woke up this morning
and he wasn't there,

120
00:08:48,916 --> 00:08:50,881
he didn't show up to work,
missed the deadline,

121
00:08:51,032 --> 00:08:53,159
he hasn't called,
it's just not like him.

122
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:55,250
I heard you guys
were having some problems.

123
00:08:55,770 --> 00:08:56,933
That was a while ago.

124
00:08:59,274 --> 00:09:00,840
Could there be anyone else in his life?

125
00:09:00,964 --> 00:09:02,108
You mean like another woman?

126
00:09:02,228 --> 00:09:03,897
I have to ask these questions, Kate.

127
00:09:05,177 --> 00:09:06,463
No one I know of.

128
00:09:07,421 --> 00:09:08,556
Except maybe Livia.

129
00:09:09,733 --> 00:09:11,266
Yeah, well... he married you.

130
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,224
And Livia's been dead for like, 9 years.

131
00:09:13,346 --> 00:09:16,513
I don't think he left me, Jack,
if that's what you mean.

132
00:09:18,103 --> 00:09:19,335
So what do you want me to do?

133
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:22,253
You're a cop and his brother,
you tell me.

134
00:09:22,373 --> 00:09:24,439
It's a little early
to file a Missing Persons.

135
00:09:25,681 --> 00:09:26,693
All right.

136
00:09:27,555 --> 00:09:29,389
I'll talk to some of the guys and...

137
00:09:29,923 --> 00:09:31,045
put the word out.

138
00:09:33,111 --> 00:09:34,111
Thank you.

139
00:10:45,292 --> 00:10:46,292
You okay?

140
00:10:46,578 --> 00:10:48,357
I'm okay, yeah.

141
00:10:48,713 --> 00:10:49,713
I think so.

142
00:10:52,392 --> 00:10:53,637
Maybe you should go home.

143
00:10:54,116 --> 00:10:55,116
Sleep it off.

144
00:10:55,950 --> 00:10:57,879
I almost killed myself...

145
00:10:59,151 --> 00:11:00,151
over a woman.

146
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:02,463
Crazy, uh?

147
00:11:03,724 --> 00:11:05,311
They can make you do that some times.

148
00:11:07,282 --> 00:11:08,282
What's your name?

149
00:11:08,636 --> 00:11:09,636
Dan.

150
00:11:10,278 --> 00:11:12,207
I'm Neal Gaines.
Neal.

151
00:11:13,856 --> 00:11:14,856
Thanks, man.

152
00:11:16,237 --> 00:11:17,893
Lot of time left in the clock.

153
00:11:18,988 --> 00:11:19,988
Move on.

154
00:11:23,352 --> 00:11:24,433
And no kidding.

155
00:11:42,446 --> 00:11:44,457
I'll be fine.
I'll take something to sleep.

156
00:11:44,991 --> 00:11:46,975
I'm just running out of things
to tell Zack.

157
00:12:01,548 --> 00:12:02,548
I'm home.

158
00:12:13,747 --> 00:12:15,047
Zack might still be awake.

159
00:12:21,586 --> 00:12:22,817
Where have you been, Dan?

160
00:12:23,994 --> 00:12:24,994
I don't know.

161
00:12:25,239 --> 00:12:27,209
- You don't know, because...
- I don't remember.

162
00:12:28,294 --> 00:12:31,375
Just going to bed last night
and having this long vivid dream.

163
00:12:31,497 --> 00:12:32,837
I save this guy's life,

164
00:12:33,275 --> 00:12:34,944
Neal something, and then I woke up.

165
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:37,713
So you're saying
this is some sleep disorder.

166
00:12:37,835 --> 00:12:39,518
I don't know what else it can be.

167
00:12:39,682 --> 00:12:40,709
Unless I was drugged.

168
00:12:40,969 --> 00:12:43,063
Something's happening to me,
I can't explain it.

169
00:12:43,185 --> 00:12:44,335
Like the other night,

170
00:12:44,792 --> 00:12:46,762
I fell asleep in one cab
and woke up in another.

171
00:12:46,886 --> 00:12:49,053
Maybe you should go see Dr. Paulin
in the morning.

172
00:12:49,175 --> 00:12:50,379
- Yeah, I will.
- Unless...

173
00:12:51,912 --> 00:12:53,458
you're hanging out with Eddie again.

174
00:12:53,731 --> 00:12:54,786
You can tell me the truth.

175
00:12:54,910 --> 00:12:57,523
I have been here,
here in this house, in this city.

176
00:12:57,645 --> 00:12:59,095
No, you've been gone for two days!

177
00:13:04,211 --> 00:13:05,211
Two days?

178
00:13:08,767 --> 00:13:09,821
Maybe you could have...

179
00:13:10,833 --> 00:13:12,147
lobbed in a phone call.

180
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:15,962
I couldn't.

181
00:13:16,180 --> 00:13:17,180
Why?

182
00:13:20,107 --> 00:13:21,517
This was 20 years ago.

183
00:13:24,312 --> 00:13:26,447
- So?
- I'd rather not get into it.

184
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:27,570
Really?

185
00:13:27,925 --> 00:13:31,046
You missed the deadline on your story,
you scared the hell out of your wife,

186
00:13:31,168 --> 00:13:32,979
and there's not gonna
be any accountability.

187
00:13:33,102 --> 00:13:35,114
You said
the story wasn't time sensitive.

188
00:13:35,236 --> 00:13:36,593
It wasn't then, but now it is.

189
00:13:36,715 --> 00:13:38,725
You'll get it today.
All I need...

190
00:13:39,286 --> 00:13:41,434
is a second source,
it just takes a phone call.

191
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:43,160
What's going on, Dan?

192
00:13:44,016 --> 00:13:46,548
I mean, is it gambling
or... something else?

193
00:13:46,670 --> 00:13:48,545
It's not gambling,
and it won't happen again.

194
00:13:50,596 --> 00:13:51,937
Finish the mayor story.

195
00:13:52,553 --> 00:13:54,634
- I want it by noon.
- Right, thank you.

196
00:13:55,864 --> 00:13:57,205
And yet, you're standing.

197
00:14:05,918 --> 00:14:08,271
Dan Vasser for Gary Tucker?
Thank you.

198
00:14:13,333 --> 00:14:14,401
Well, how long?

199
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:16,070
You said that last time.

200
00:14:23,299 --> 00:14:24,299
He exists.

201
00:14:32,156 --> 00:14:34,936
<i>You've reached the offices
of the of the brain psychiatry.</i>

202
00:14:35,058 --> 00:14:37,657
<i>Our directory has changed,
so listen carefully...</i>

203
00:14:41,622 --> 00:14:43,141
I won't like being nervous.

204
00:14:43,647 --> 00:14:46,233
Just remember that the other kids
are gonna be nervous too.

205
00:14:46,753 --> 00:14:47,766
And remember,

206
00:14:47,889 --> 00:14:50,913
the more you know the song,
the less nervous you'll be.

207
00:14:51,053 --> 00:14:53,052
Practice + Confidence = Success.

208
00:14:53,174 --> 00:14:55,637
- Exactly.
- Dad's car looks like that.

209
00:14:56,914 --> 00:14:58,720
Dad's car looks like that one!

210
00:15:00,491 --> 00:15:03,748
<i>You can see a late model blue Mustang
directly below me,</i>

211
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:06,675
<i>which appears to be the car
that started the collision.</i>

212
00:15:15,788 --> 00:15:17,649
- Hello?
- Katie, it's Hugh.

213
00:15:18,005 --> 00:15:20,360
Is Dan around?
He's two hours late on a deadline.

214
00:15:20,482 --> 00:15:22,564
- No, he's been in a car accident.
- Is he okay?

215
00:15:22,686 --> 00:15:24,137
I don't know, he...

216
00:15:24,479 --> 00:15:26,244
ran a red light, hit two cars and...

217
00:15:26,517 --> 00:15:27,735
<i>he left the scene, Hugh.</i>

218
00:15:27,927 --> 00:15:29,925
- Oh, God.
- No one else was hurt, thank god.

219
00:15:34,582 --> 00:15:35,950
<i>I think Dan needs help.</i>

220
00:15:36,156 --> 00:15:37,168
No kidding?

221
00:15:38,974 --> 00:15:40,972
There's a facility in Auburn
I know is good.

222
00:15:42,190 --> 00:15:43,763
Auburn is for drug users.

223
00:16:20,664 --> 00:16:22,554
Hold on. See this guy next to me?

224
00:16:22,676 --> 00:16:24,331
Beam me up Scotty

225
00:16:27,383 --> 00:16:28,383
Is there a problem?

226
00:16:41,403 --> 00:16:42,415
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

227
00:17:07,994 --> 00:17:09,064
Neal, I think we should...

228
00:17:09,186 --> 00:17:10,882
Nicole, please.
I want to make this work.

229
00:17:11,004 --> 00:17:12,264
- I do too.
- I love you

230
00:17:12,386 --> 00:17:14,697
- and I want to start a family with you.
- But not now.

231
00:17:14,819 --> 00:17:16,091
You always say that.

232
00:17:16,625 --> 00:17:19,717
Neal, I've made up my mind.
I'm not keeping it.

233
00:17:20,593 --> 00:17:21,824
You know where I stand.

234
00:17:22,741 --> 00:17:24,479
And you know what I want.

235
00:17:25,827 --> 00:17:27,373
- Fine, Nicole.
- Neal!

236
00:17:32,532 --> 00:17:33,532
Sorry.

237
00:17:34,064 --> 00:17:35,064
I'm so sorry.

238
00:17:40,601 --> 00:17:41,601
Livia?

239
00:17:42,599 --> 00:17:43,599
Do I know you?

240
00:17:46,321 --> 00:17:47,333
Not yet.

241
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:51,415
You're freaking me out with the staring.

242
00:17:51,990 --> 00:17:54,700
The hooker outfits is my day job,
I'm a student by night.

243
00:17:54,822 --> 00:17:55,822
Sorry.

244
00:17:57,299 --> 00:17:58,299
It's just...

245
00:17:58,861 --> 00:18:00,380
You look like someone I once knew.

246
00:18:01,187 --> 00:18:02,350
You once knew?

247
00:18:03,596 --> 00:18:04,596
Didn't end well.

248
00:18:04,745 --> 00:18:06,963
Well, don't take it out on my gratuity

249
00:18:07,085 --> 00:18:09,206
Try to spill any more drinks on me
and I won't.

250
00:18:10,204 --> 00:18:12,653
Sorry, I'm just... having a bad day.

251
00:18:21,357 --> 00:18:24,176
You shouldn't stress about school,
you'll be a great lawyer some day.

252
00:18:25,435 --> 00:18:26,872
Who said anything about law school?

253
00:18:28,472 --> 00:18:29,594
I thought you did.

254
00:18:33,978 --> 00:18:35,401
The conversation's over.

255
00:18:36,907 --> 00:18:37,933
Hey, Neal!

256
00:18:43,781 --> 00:18:44,971
What did he do to you?

257
00:18:45,833 --> 00:18:48,282
Nothing, he owes me some money.

258
00:18:50,855 --> 00:18:51,855
You?

259
00:18:52,203 --> 00:18:53,243
Knocked me up.

260
00:18:55,911 --> 00:18:57,666
There's not gonna be a baby shower.

261
00:18:57,786 --> 00:18:58,806
Got that right.

262
00:18:58,943 --> 00:19:01,398
I told him from the start "no kids,"
I just...

263
00:19:01,644 --> 00:19:02,985
I just got this job.

264
00:19:04,756 --> 00:19:07,479
We went through the same thing
with Zack, my son.

265
00:19:10,011 --> 00:19:11,023
Do you regret it?

266
00:19:12,597 --> 00:19:13,678
Having a kid?

267
00:19:18,421 --> 00:19:20,295
I'd do anything right now
to be back to him.

268
00:19:30,570 --> 00:19:32,376
- Good luck with that.
- Thanks.

269
00:19:35,885 --> 00:19:36,885
You too!

270
00:20:10,880 --> 00:20:13,126
So... were you high
when you ran the red light?

271
00:20:13,248 --> 00:20:15,260
- Is that why you took off?
- It's not drugs.

272
00:20:15,382 --> 00:20:17,695
I told you the truth
and I go on these...

273
00:20:18,359 --> 00:20:19,906
- These trips
- Through time.

274
00:20:20,201 --> 00:20:21,318
Go ahead, you can say that.

275
00:20:21,438 --> 00:20:22,618
That's exactly what I mean,

276
00:20:22,738 --> 00:20:25,373
I'd rather people think
I'm a crack addict than think I'm crazy.

277
00:20:25,495 --> 00:20:26,810
Where did you trip to this time?

278
00:20:26,932 --> 00:20:28,615
- You'll never believe me.
- Try me.

279
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:33,067
Remember that guy I told you about?
His name is Neal Gaines.

280
00:20:33,997 --> 00:20:35,858
Now I think I am tracking his life.

281
00:20:37,041 --> 00:20:38,725
I think I just helped him
start a family.

282
00:20:38,848 --> 00:20:41,573
Well, that's great! How about
sticking around and saving this one?

283
00:20:41,693 --> 00:20:43,431
No, I've got from thinking that...

284
00:20:43,595 --> 00:20:46,988
that you ran out on us to wondering
if you're lying bleeding in some alley.

285
00:20:47,980 --> 00:20:50,730
I've stuck with you
for some pretty tough times.

286
00:20:51,791 --> 00:20:53,761
But at least back then
you came home at night.

287
00:21:05,255 --> 00:21:06,268
It's not ready.

288
00:21:08,005 --> 00:21:10,335
Here's the thing,
it was supposed to be ready last week,

289
00:21:10,455 --> 00:21:12,756
I need that ring today,
so I need you to do it now.

290
00:21:12,876 --> 00:21:15,695
I'll sit here all day if I have to
but I'm not leaving without it.

291
00:21:29,446 --> 00:21:30,814
It's not my birthday.

292
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:33,674
So I'm gonna go with an...

293
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:35,637
- intervention?
- Don't be mad.

294
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:37,011
- Where's Zack?
- At my Mum's.

295
00:21:37,134 --> 00:21:38,824
Everyone's here
'cause we care about you.

296
00:21:38,947 --> 00:21:40,637
Everyone here is getting it wrong.

297
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:41,884
I've been where you've been.

298
00:21:42,020 --> 00:21:44,878
I guarantee you you have not been
where I have been.

299
00:21:45,058 --> 00:21:47,604
Guys, I know you all care about me
and I appreciate it

300
00:21:47,726 --> 00:21:50,299
but substance abuse is not my problem.

301
00:21:50,901 --> 00:21:55,348
And don't say I am in denial,
even though I am in full denial mode.

302
00:21:55,579 --> 00:21:56,837
I'm not going anywhere.

303
00:21:57,332 --> 00:21:58,825
I'll still be here when you get back.

304
00:21:58,945 --> 00:21:59,945
Come on.

305
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,913
Seriously. If any Vasser
has a drinking problem, it's me.

306
00:22:03,679 --> 00:22:05,047
Can I talk to you a sec?

307
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,866
You're the last person
I expected to come to my defense.

308
00:22:12,988 --> 00:22:13,988
I didn't.

309
00:22:14,767 --> 00:22:16,942
I'm here to arrest you
for felony hit-and-run.

310
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:19,522
Can I call my lawyer?

311
00:22:19,946 --> 00:22:21,323
I'm pretty sure you can't do that.

312
00:22:21,446 --> 00:22:22,455
Where have you been?

313
00:22:22,586 --> 00:22:25,314
- Am I under arrest, or not ?
- I bring you in for questioning.

314
00:22:26,354 --> 00:22:29,071
Katie did a story on how you ask
questions at this precinct

315
00:22:29,193 --> 00:22:30,520
and believe me, I need a lawyer.

316
00:22:31,050 --> 00:22:33,701
You don't need a lawyer
'cause I'm not gonna charge you.

317
00:22:33,821 --> 00:22:35,449
No one saw you flee the scene, in fact,

318
00:22:35,586 --> 00:22:37,435
one witness says
no one wasn't even driving

319
00:22:37,557 --> 00:22:40,219
so, short of nailing you
for not setting the parking brake,

320
00:22:40,341 --> 00:22:41,341
I got nothing.

321
00:22:41,904 --> 00:22:42,904
Sit down.

322
00:22:43,368 --> 00:22:44,368
So...

323
00:22:45,257 --> 00:22:48,188
Why don't you tell me what the hell
is going on and we can all go home?

324
00:22:48,308 --> 00:22:49,308
I wish I knew.

325
00:22:49,430 --> 00:22:52,959
Katie says you disappeared for a couple
days and didn't even know it.

326
00:22:53,079 --> 00:22:54,079
Something like that.

327
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:55,515
And you went back in time.

328
00:22:58,019 --> 00:23:00,773
It's just these dreams,
but I'm glad you two are talking again.

329
00:23:00,893 --> 00:23:03,273
- She came to me.
- This may work out great for you.

330
00:23:06,928 --> 00:23:08,365
I wouldn't do that to a brother.

331
00:23:10,677 --> 00:23:12,087
You only have yourself to blame.

332
00:23:15,199 --> 00:23:16,199
Can I go now?

333
00:23:17,621 --> 00:23:18,743
Sure, Dan.

334
00:23:19,687 --> 00:23:20,687
But...

335
00:23:21,329 --> 00:23:23,053
tell your wife I tried to listen.

336
00:23:32,531 --> 00:23:33,584
I saw Livia.

337
00:23:35,308 --> 00:23:36,308
On this...

338
00:23:38,220 --> 00:23:40,095
On this last... trip,

339
00:23:40,546 --> 00:23:41,546
or whatever.

340
00:23:46,256 --> 00:23:48,760
I wanted to tell her not to get
on that plane, but I didn't.

341
00:23:49,390 --> 00:23:51,717
I said something about her life
that hadn't happened yet.

342
00:23:51,867 --> 00:23:52,879
I spooked her.

343
00:23:54,251 --> 00:23:57,918
I might have blown my chance
of her liking me before we ever met.

344
00:24:00,983 --> 00:24:01,983
Anyway...

345
00:24:02,598 --> 00:24:03,598
Forget it.

346
00:24:07,536 --> 00:24:08,536
Get some help.

347
00:24:09,302 --> 00:24:10,302
Seriously.

348
00:24:53,877 --> 00:24:54,877
Dead?

349
00:25:21,409 --> 00:25:22,409
Taxi!

350
00:25:31,643 --> 00:25:33,066
18.97.

351
00:25:33,887 --> 00:25:36,131
- Just-- Keep the change.
- Thank you.

352
00:26:01,457 --> 00:26:02,469
Howard Street.

353
00:26:03,195 --> 00:26:04,195
Howard next.

354
00:26:23,678 --> 00:26:25,758
I locked myself out again Mrs. Shay.

355
00:27:16,001 --> 00:27:18,929
Hey, what are you doing here?
You're never home during the day.

356
00:27:23,009 --> 00:27:24,637
I needed something for work.

357
00:27:26,006 --> 00:27:27,526
The fitness hearing got cancelled,

358
00:27:27,648 --> 00:27:30,315
so you wanna go off
to the restaurant together?

359
00:27:30,869 --> 00:27:31,869
I can't, I...

360
00:27:32,645 --> 00:27:33,876
- I'll see you there
- Okay.

361
00:27:34,451 --> 00:27:35,751
I was talking to Gerald.

362
00:27:36,216 --> 00:27:38,434
He agreed. Napa's too expensive.

363
00:27:38,556 --> 00:27:40,760
And he knows
about these old officer's quarters

364
00:27:40,882 --> 00:27:42,442
and a procedure that's better.

365
00:27:43,446 --> 00:27:44,472
For what?

366
00:27:44,979 --> 00:27:46,484
Our wedding reception, dummy.

367
00:27:51,533 --> 00:27:52,533
Livia...

368
00:27:54,662 --> 00:27:56,837
Unless you have changed your mind
about marrying me.

369
00:27:58,069 --> 00:27:59,711
- Never.
- Are you okay?

370
00:28:00,080 --> 00:28:01,312
Yeah, why?

371
00:28:02,228 --> 00:28:04,185
- You look different.
- Different?

372
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:05,730
Tired.

373
00:28:06,741 --> 00:28:08,219
It's been a long week.

374
00:28:08,903 --> 00:28:10,080
You wanna talk about it?

375
00:28:12,310 --> 00:28:13,977
Wouldn't know where to start.I

376
00:28:15,191 --> 00:28:16,847
I don't know if I can save the week,

377
00:28:17,244 --> 00:28:18,913
but your day's about to get better.

378
00:28:34,961 --> 00:28:35,961
I gotta go.

379
00:28:36,141 --> 00:28:37,414
Are you sure you're all right?

380
00:28:42,942 --> 00:28:43,968
I'm on a deadline.

381
00:28:46,298 --> 00:28:47,639
We'll finish this later.

382
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:00,903
How did you--

383
00:29:01,423 --> 00:29:02,627
It is you.

384
00:29:07,874 --> 00:29:09,352
How did you get out of here?

385
00:29:10,378 --> 00:29:11,514
Don't go in there.

386
00:29:15,181 --> 00:29:16,316
This way. Now.

387
00:29:25,973 --> 00:29:26,986
Stop!

388
00:29:30,558 --> 00:29:33,037
They found the plane in the water
but not your body.

389
00:29:33,157 --> 00:29:34,526
So, did you even get on that plane

390
00:29:34,662 --> 00:29:36,455
or am I just talking to a ghost?

391
00:29:37,495 --> 00:29:38,495
It's me.

392
00:29:39,647 --> 00:29:41,248
I left before it went down.

393
00:29:42,137 --> 00:29:43,698
- What?
- Do you know why you're here?

394
00:29:43,820 --> 00:29:45,356
- No.
- You now who you're following?

395
00:29:45,476 --> 00:29:46,476
Some guy and his family.

396
00:29:46,694 --> 00:29:48,433
Stay on it. Go with your instincts.

397
00:29:48,555 --> 00:29:49,676
What if I get it wrong?

398
00:29:49,798 --> 00:29:52,535
You will, that's part of it.
Just don't mess with anything.

399
00:29:53,069 --> 00:29:54,875
I don't think I'm not supposed
to be here.

400
00:30:33,455 --> 00:30:34,455
<i>Hello?</i>

401
00:30:34,783 --> 00:30:36,961
Hey, it's me.
I need a favor, it's kind of urgent.

402
00:30:37,081 --> 00:30:38,081
Like what?

403
00:30:38,239 --> 00:30:40,054
I gotta find someone
and I only have a name.

404
00:30:40,174 --> 00:30:41,869
- I tried information.
- You're asking,

405
00:30:41,991 --> 00:30:44,085
"Can I violate protocol
and use the police database

406
00:30:44,208 --> 00:30:45,345
to help out my kid brother?"

407
00:30:45,467 --> 00:30:48,434
I forgot that you weren't just recently
a prick, that goes back years

408
00:30:48,617 --> 00:30:50,055
- Excuse me?
- <i>Nothing, listen.</i>

409
00:30:50,177 --> 00:30:52,731
At least two people I know
are gonna die tonight.

410
00:30:52,853 --> 00:30:54,427
- <i>You're kidding. How?</i>
- I don't know.

411
00:30:54,549 --> 00:30:58,227
This is gonna sound crazy
but I know they're gonna die in 1997

412
00:30:58,349 --> 00:30:59,805
<i>and there's only a few hours left.</i>

413
00:30:59,928 --> 00:31:01,021
What are you talking about?

414
00:31:01,141 --> 00:31:03,454
<i>Forget it, I just need you
to help me find someone.</i>

415
00:31:03,576 --> 00:31:04,944
<i>His name is Neal Gaines.</i>

416
00:31:07,104 --> 00:31:08,513
<i>Hello, are you there?</i>

417
00:31:09,128 --> 00:31:10,807
- Who is this?
- What do you mean?

418
00:31:10,927 --> 00:31:12,815
- You're not my brother.
- Of course, I am.

419
00:31:13,198 --> 00:31:15,218
You're not,
'cause I'm looking at him right now.

420
00:31:15,338 --> 00:31:17,048
You know, we're having lunch at Luna,

421
00:31:17,322 --> 00:31:20,100
if you want to come by and meet him,
get pass, we'll kick your ass.

422
00:31:57,578 --> 00:31:59,248
Hey, guys. Quiet, I wanna make a toast!

423
00:32:01,998 --> 00:32:03,435
- What?
- Thank you.

424
00:32:03,995 --> 00:32:05,952
I wanna make a toast to Dan and Livia.

425
00:32:06,511 --> 00:32:07,825
You guys make wanna just say,

426
00:32:08,304 --> 00:32:10,945
Gee, this stuff that's better
left in a Hallmark card, but...

427
00:32:11,095 --> 00:32:13,708
champagne has emboldened me, so...

428
00:32:14,674 --> 00:32:17,569
Dan, I've never seen you
so happy as you are with Livia.

429
00:32:17,691 --> 00:32:19,717
and now, hanging around her,
I can see why.

430
00:32:19,839 --> 00:32:21,515
She is loving

431
00:32:21,707 --> 00:32:25,497
and brilliant and beautiful
and that's why I hate her.

432
00:32:27,708 --> 00:32:28,939
And Livia,

433
00:32:29,364 --> 00:32:31,019
- May I--
- * your brother's.

434
00:32:34,659 --> 00:32:39,521
May I say you have as a future husband
a smart and handsome...

435
00:32:39,876 --> 00:32:44,939
and passionate man who makes me
and you and all of us laugh.

436
00:32:45,923 --> 00:32:47,983
So I hope that your commitment
to one another

437
00:32:48,105 --> 00:32:49,618
will stand the test of time.

438
00:32:49,768 --> 00:32:52,163
and Y2K
'cause you know that's gonna be bad.

439
00:32:52,299 --> 00:32:54,982
I shouldn't of had that third glass

440
00:32:55,104 --> 00:32:57,183
so I'm just gonna finish up by saying...

441
00:32:59,171 --> 00:33:00,950
to an enduring love.

442
00:33:02,907 --> 00:33:04,015
To an enduring love.

443
00:33:04,727 --> 00:33:06,451
- Cheers.
- Thank you.

444
00:33:08,271 --> 00:33:09,271
Was I good?

445
00:33:10,999 --> 00:33:12,108
I'll be right there.

446
00:33:12,853 --> 00:33:15,870
There's been a break in this last
new case, and the * want to talk to me

447
00:33:17,252 --> 00:33:18,777
This is an engagement lunch.

448
00:33:18,899 --> 00:33:21,527
I know, Dan has been working on it
for the last 6 months.

449
00:33:21,649 --> 00:33:23,674
I'll... hook up later.

450
00:33:23,838 --> 00:33:27,013
- Take in 1998 like it's 1997.
- Baby.

451
00:33:28,744 --> 00:33:29,894
You can't leave on that.

452
00:33:47,096 --> 00:33:48,642
- Hey, you forgot something?
- Yeah.

453
00:33:49,057 --> 00:33:50,644
More champaign?

454
00:33:50,781 --> 00:33:52,053
Can I talk to you for a sec?

455
00:33:52,218 --> 00:33:53,813
I need an adress and a phone number

456
00:33:53,935 --> 00:33:55,503
- that's not listed.
- Why?

457
00:33:55,625 --> 00:33:58,157
That's for the deep background
in the Harris story.

458
00:33:58,279 --> 00:33:59,333
Why don't you ask Jack?

459
00:33:59,644 --> 00:34:01,081
I already did, he's not helping.

460
00:34:01,587 --> 00:34:04,283
You're deputy D.A., you have access.

461
00:34:04,789 --> 00:34:05,789
It's really important.

462
00:34:06,595 --> 00:34:09,387
- What are the names?
- Neil Gaines and Nicole Gaines.

463
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:12,803
I'll try, I can't promise anything.

464
00:34:13,843 --> 00:34:15,362
And my cell battery just died.

465
00:34:16,046 --> 00:34:18,168
So I'm gonna meet Mrs. Harris
at the noodle bar,

466
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:19,290
can you call me there?

467
00:34:19,868 --> 00:34:20,868
And...

468
00:34:22,167 --> 00:34:24,562
I need some money for a cab,
I forgot my wallet.

469
00:34:24,684 --> 00:34:26,627
Okay, that's a first.
I love you.

470
00:34:31,348 --> 00:34:32,348
Me too.

471
00:34:44,506 --> 00:34:45,628
- Hello?
- <i>Hey.</i>

472
00:34:45,901 --> 00:34:49,186
So, it's a Neal Gaines who works
at Foogade & Town Realty

473
00:34:49,308 --> 00:34:50,978
at 7298, 3rd Street.

474
00:34:51,201 --> 00:34:53,322
- 7298, thanks.
- You owe me.

475
00:34:53,595 --> 00:34:54,799
I do. Bye.

476
00:35:31,082 --> 00:35:32,082
Neal?

477
00:35:32,875 --> 00:35:33,875
Neal Gaines?

478
00:35:37,038 --> 00:35:38,214
Greg Flooler.

479
00:35:38,693 --> 00:35:40,416
I went to high school with you.

480
00:35:41,416 --> 00:35:43,044
I haven't seen you since the reunion.

481
00:35:43,879 --> 00:35:45,201
- I don't remember you.
- Sure,

482
00:35:45,323 --> 00:35:48,565
we went to Berkeley together,
you married Nicole and you had a kid.

483
00:35:48,702 --> 00:35:49,702
How are they?

484
00:35:56,785 --> 00:35:58,399
They're moving to L.A. today.

485
00:35:58,755 --> 00:35:59,781
Really?

486
00:36:00,620 --> 00:36:01,620
Right.

487
00:36:03,795 --> 00:36:05,491
So you guys are splitting up?

488
00:36:08,725 --> 00:36:09,943
Do you still love her?

489
00:36:12,419 --> 00:36:14,157
That's why I'm not gonna let her go.

490
00:37:02,388 --> 00:37:03,962
Take Jacob inside the house.

491
00:37:12,281 --> 00:37:13,281
Oh, my God!

492
00:37:16,232 --> 00:37:17,340
Oh, my God.

493
00:37:21,801 --> 00:37:23,142
He just jumped in front.

494
00:37:25,316 --> 00:37:26,698
He was gonna do it.

495
00:37:29,326 --> 00:37:32,350
He said he was coming to kill us
if we left him.

496
00:37:34,620 --> 00:37:36,084
He said it this morning.

497
00:38:10,117 --> 00:38:11,130
Hey, it's me.

498
00:38:12,088 --> 00:38:13,100
I need a ride home.

499
00:38:21,020 --> 00:38:22,390
What do you mean, Jacob Gaines?

500
00:38:22,512 --> 00:38:23,825
Neal Gaines' son.

501
00:38:24,017 --> 00:38:26,536
Jacob graduated pre-med
from Stanford at 17

502
00:38:26,658 --> 00:38:28,233
and I'm thinking he's gonna go on

503
00:38:28,355 --> 00:38:30,886
and map the human genome or something
but instead...

504
00:38:36,156 --> 00:38:37,456
You know what I'm looking at?

505
00:38:37,866 --> 00:38:40,617
A schoolbus wreck in Gilroy, last year.

506
00:38:40,908 --> 00:38:42,837
Jacob pulled out six kids,

507
00:38:43,139 --> 00:38:44,534
performed a tracheotomy on one.

508
00:38:48,434 --> 00:38:50,377
It was all about
protecting Neal Gaines' son.

509
00:38:53,534 --> 00:38:55,586
And you think you had something
to do with this?

510
00:38:58,515 --> 00:38:59,883
You're gonna lose KAtie.

511
00:39:00,389 --> 00:39:01,607
Right? You know that?

512
00:39:05,503 --> 00:39:06,503
Not without a fight.

513
00:39:20,293 --> 00:39:22,333
- I think you need to leave.
- Just give me 5 min.

514
00:39:22,455 --> 00:39:24,571
We'll talk about this tomorrow.
Not in front of...

515
00:39:26,116 --> 00:39:27,334
- Hey!
- Dad!

516
00:39:28,559 --> 00:39:29,674
I'm glad to see you.

517
00:39:30,166 --> 00:39:31,166
You're back for good?

518
00:39:32,985 --> 00:39:35,009
Mom and Dad need to have a little talk,
okay?

519
00:39:35,129 --> 00:39:36,470
I'll come say good night, okay?

520
00:39:43,530 --> 00:39:44,734
Just bear with me.

521
00:39:56,535 --> 00:39:57,739
I'm not what you married.

522
00:39:58,259 --> 00:39:59,327
And I'm sorry about that.

523
00:40:09,692 --> 00:40:10,967
When did we put this patio in?

524
00:40:11,089 --> 00:40:12,252
Right after we moved in.

525
00:40:12,374 --> 00:40:13,523
Seven years ago, right?

526
00:40:13,674 --> 00:40:14,674
Right?

527
00:40:15,945 --> 00:40:16,971
