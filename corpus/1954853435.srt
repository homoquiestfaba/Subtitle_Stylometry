1
00:00:38,533 --> 00:00:40,900
Now I lay me down to sleep.

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,700
<i>Now I lay me down to sleep.</i>

3
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,733
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
<i>Now I lay me down to sleep.</i>

4
00:00:47,833 --> 00:00:52,033
<i>If I should die before I wake.
If I should die before I wake.</i>

5
00:00:52,133 --> 00:00:55,666
Now I lay me down to sleep. <i>I
pray the Lord my soul to keep.</i>

6
00:00:55,766 --> 00:00:58,766
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.
<i>If I should die before I wake.</i>

7
00:00:58,866 --> 00:00:59,999
If I should die before I wake. <i>I
pray the Lord my soul to take.</i>

8
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,433
If I should die before I wake. <i>I
pray the Lord my soul to take.</i>

9
00:01:03,533 --> 00:01:06,133
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

10
00:02:44,212 --> 00:02:47,478
Bet I'll beat you there. Oh, yeah?
Bet you won't.

11
00:03:12,478 --> 00:03:16,212
My mother says that's where
the weird kids live.

12
00:03:16,312 --> 00:03:21,512
<i>They're not weird. They're
just foster children.</i>

13
00:03:21,612 --> 00:03:26,078
It's the scariest house I've ever seen.
I'm not afraid of it.

14
00:03:29,212 --> 00:03:29,999
I guess you're not so tough <i>now.</i>

15
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,512
I guess you're not so tough <i>now.</i>

16
00:03:35,178 --> 00:03:37,878
Wait. What are you doing?

17
00:03:38,745 --> 00:03:42,278
Are you crazy?
You can't go in there!

18
00:03:42,378 --> 00:03:44,278
Watch me.

19
00:03:54,478 --> 00:03:58,878
- <i>Come back!
- Come back!</i>

20
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:15,912
Hello?

21
00:04:24,312 --> 00:04:26,245
Are you o--

22
00:04:27,245 --> 00:04:29,945
Oh!

23
00:07:34,612 --> 00:07:36,912
Be strong.

24
00:07:46,512 --> 00:07:49,845
Are we gonna play games today,
Claire, or have a real discussion?

25
00:07:49,945 --> 00:07:53,345
A real discussion. Good.

26
00:07:53,445 --> 00:07:56,445
And don't even try to claim
you're taking your prescriptions,

27
00:07:56,545 --> 00:07:58,245
'cause I can tell you're not.

28
00:07:58,345 --> 00:07:59,999
I don't wanna go through my whole
life feeling like a zombie.

29
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,112
I don't wanna go through my whole
life feeling like a zombie.

30
00:08:01,212 --> 00:08:03,312
- I understand that.
- No, you don't understand,

31
00:08:03,412 --> 00:08:05,845
'cause you don't
have to take all that shit.

32
00:08:05,945 --> 00:08:07,845
Well, is the alternative better?

33
00:08:07,945 --> 00:08:10,245
Night terrors,
the panic attacks,

34
00:08:10,345 --> 00:08:13,278
the serious episodes of
depression-- You know what?

35
00:08:13,378 --> 00:08:15,845
The only thing
that I wanna do is act,

36
00:08:15,945 --> 00:08:18,778
and I can't do that if I'm
cut off from my emotions.

37
00:08:18,878 --> 00:08:22,578
If I can't do the only thing that makes
me happy, I might as well be dead.

38
00:08:30,345 --> 00:08:33,345
I agree with you that the meds
are a Band-Aid solution.

39
00:08:33,445 --> 00:08:38,078
Have you given any thought
to my suggestion?

40
00:08:38,178 --> 00:08:40,678
Have you visited
the Darrode house?

41
00:08:43,445 --> 00:08:47,278
I've tried to...
a whole bunch of times.

42
00:08:47,378 --> 00:08:50,045
- Really?
- Yep.

43
00:08:50,145 --> 00:08:53,078
I-- I stand out front...

44
00:08:53,178 --> 00:08:58,245
and I can't breathe
and my whole body shakes.

45
00:08:58,345 --> 00:08:59,999
I've tried to make it through
the gate, but I just can't.

46
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,078
I've tried to make it through
the gate, but I just can't.

47
00:09:01,178 --> 00:09:04,545
I can't get past it.

48
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:09,078
What happened to you
in that house was so terrible,

49
00:09:09,178 --> 00:09:12,645
your mind just locked it
in a steel vault.

50
00:09:12,745 --> 00:09:15,045
Should I really
want to open it up?

51
00:09:15,145 --> 00:09:18,045
Until you unlock those events
and face your past,

52
00:09:18,145 --> 00:09:20,778
your disorders
will never dissipate.

53
00:09:20,878 --> 00:09:23,512
We've tried
everything else, Claire--

54
00:09:23,612 --> 00:09:26,612
Hypnosis, regression therapy--

55
00:09:26,712 --> 00:09:29,345
You know what? I'm scared, okay?

56
00:09:29,445 --> 00:09:29,999
I'm too fucking scared.

57
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:32,245
I'm too fucking scared.

58
00:09:32,345 --> 00:09:34,778
Find a way.

59
00:09:34,878 --> 00:09:38,345
Take an army in there
with you if you have to.

60
00:09:38,445 --> 00:09:42,045
Only by returning to the scene of
the traumas can you overcome them.

61
00:09:42,145 --> 00:09:46,012
Even if going there
is traumatic?

62
00:09:46,112 --> 00:09:48,912
You can never know who you are
until you can remember...

63
00:09:49,012 --> 00:09:51,878
what took place
at the Darrode house.

64
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:57,612
But once those repressed
memories come back,

65
00:09:57,712 --> 00:09:59,512
you will finally be free.

66
00:10:08,612 --> 00:10:12,278
What is
the essence of performance?

67
00:10:12,378 --> 00:10:17,045
Acting is the art of communicating
with the audience...

68
00:10:17,145 --> 00:10:22,012
through the use of truthful
and authentic behavior.

69
00:10:22,112 --> 00:10:26,845
Authenticity is a muscle.
<i>You have to exercise it.</i>

70
00:10:26,945 --> 00:10:29,978
So, before today's scenes--

71
00:10:30,078 --> 00:10:33,778
This punishment
is both cruel and unusual.

72
00:10:33,878 --> 00:10:36,745
I want my lawyer.

73
00:10:36,845 --> 00:10:37,023
Well, let's play
a little challenge and response.

74
00:10:37,024 --> 00:10:39,245
Well, let's play
a little challenge and response.

75
00:10:39,345 --> 00:10:44,145
Bruce, since you just volunteered,
get up here. Uh, you too, Eldon.

76
00:10:47,378 --> 00:10:49,312
Me first? Yeah.

77
00:10:50,778 --> 00:10:54,545
Okay. Why are you
such a smart-ass punk?

78
00:10:54,645 --> 00:10:56,812
I'm a comedian.
It's good practice.

79
00:10:56,912 --> 00:10:58,578
Why are you
such an uptight prick?

80
00:10:58,678 --> 00:11:00,378
I'm not uptight.
I'm serious-minded.

81
00:11:00,478 --> 00:11:03,778
- Did you get your butt kicked a lot in high school?
- I still do.

82
00:11:03,878 --> 00:11:07,012
- You don't like me very much, do you?
- No, I like you. I like you.

83
00:11:07,112 --> 00:11:09,945
You're cool. See, I just
like to mess with you.

84
00:11:10,045 --> 00:11:13,278
Good honesty.
Uh, Rudy, replace Bruce.

85
00:11:21,112 --> 00:11:25,245
What kind of black guy
plays chess and watches PBS?

86
00:11:25,345 --> 00:11:27,412
The thoughtful
and intelligent kind?

87
00:11:27,512 --> 00:11:30,212
Right. Why do you feel the
need to stereotype me?

88
00:11:30,312 --> 00:11:33,478
I just think it's nuts that I'm more
into basketball and rap than you.

89
00:11:33,578 --> 00:11:37,022
Are you overcompensating because
you grew up in a "white" area?

90
00:11:37,023 --> 00:11:37,078
Are you overcompensating because
you grew up in a "white" area?

91
00:11:37,178 --> 00:11:39,912
I've never thought about it.
Are you overcompensating...

92
00:11:40,012 --> 00:11:41,812
because you play sports
with "the brothers"?

93
00:11:41,912 --> 00:11:46,945
Possibly. I mean, don't you think it's
time you started dating sisters for once?

94
00:11:47,045 --> 00:11:48,912
They don't like me.

95
00:11:49,012 --> 00:11:51,112
Isn't the only reason
why you're acting...

96
00:11:51,212 --> 00:11:53,445
because you tore up your fucking knee
and can't play football anymore?

97
00:11:53,545 --> 00:11:57,278
Damn right. You think you're actually
gonna be the next Denzel or Will Smith?

98
00:11:57,378 --> 00:11:59,412
Why are you comin' down
so hard on me, man?

99
00:11:59,512 --> 00:12:03,978
- I'm just playing a game.
- You know I got love for you.

100
00:12:04,078 --> 00:12:07,022
<i>All right. Ariel, uh,
come up for Eldon.</i>

101
00:12:07,023 --> 00:12:08,583
<i>All right. Ariel, uh,
come up for Eldon.</i>

102
00:12:14,445 --> 00:12:16,778
Okay.

103
00:12:16,878 --> 00:12:21,045
So-- Who's the hottest-looking
babe in this class?

104
00:12:21,145 --> 00:12:23,912
You are.

105
00:12:24,012 --> 00:12:27,112
Why do you need me
to validate it?

106
00:12:27,212 --> 00:12:31,278
Because you're cute and...
I like to hear you say it.

107
00:12:31,378 --> 00:12:35,312
But why are you always
chasing after Claire...

108
00:12:35,412 --> 00:12:37,022
when she's obviously...
not good enough for you?

109
00:12:37,023 --> 00:12:38,678
When she's obviously...
not good enough for you?

110
00:12:38,778 --> 00:12:41,178
I'm not "always"
chasing after Claire.

111
00:12:41,278 --> 00:12:44,045
Rudy, you're now
a convicted liar.

112
00:12:44,145 --> 00:12:49,078
- Shut up.
- <i>Claire, come up and replace Rudy.</i>

113
00:12:50,912 --> 00:12:54,245
- Why are you such a sketchy bitch?
- Takes one to know one, honey.

114
00:12:54,345 --> 00:12:59,012
Why don't you just go ahead and tell Rudy you're
a lesbian freak and you're just not into guys?

115
00:12:59,112 --> 00:13:01,412
Because I'm not one.
The question is,

116
00:13:01,512 --> 00:13:04,032
which plastic surgeon is gonna fix
your face after I tear it off?

117
00:13:04,045 --> 00:13:07,022
Okay, Claire. Sit down.

118
00:13:07,023 --> 00:13:08,478
Okay, Claire. Sit down.

119
00:13:08,578 --> 00:13:10,512
Uh, Lily? Bye, Claire.

120
00:13:14,112 --> 00:13:17,512
Did you know that blondes tend
to lose their looks by age 35?

121
00:13:17,612 --> 00:13:21,345
Oh. Well, it's a really good thing you
don't have to worry about losing yours.

122
00:13:21,445 --> 00:13:24,678
What are you anyways-- a vampire
or a refugee from Salem?

123
00:13:24,778 --> 00:13:29,212
I'm just a demure, girl-next-door,
take-home-to-Mommy type.

124
00:13:29,312 --> 00:13:31,245
But I do have enough brains...

125
00:13:31,345 --> 00:13:34,945
to know that this entire exercise
is a total bullshit waste of time.

126
00:13:35,045 --> 00:13:37,022
<i>Agreed.</i>

127
00:13:37,023 --> 00:13:38,078
<i>Agreed.</i>

128
00:13:38,178 --> 00:13:42,278
Just being authentic.
Can we get to our scenes now?

129
00:13:42,378 --> 00:13:46,112
Is this
the advanced acting class?

130
00:13:47,112 --> 00:13:50,378
Yes, and class is in session.

131
00:13:50,478 --> 00:13:53,045
- Excellent. Excellent.
- How can I help you?

132
00:13:53,145 --> 00:13:55,545
Only a moment of your time,
if you please. Only a moment.

133
00:13:55,645 --> 00:14:00,512
Thank you. Thank you.
Hi. My name is Walston Ray,

134
00:14:00,612 --> 00:14:05,178
and I am the king
of horror haunts.

135
00:14:05,278 --> 00:14:07,022
And I'd like to speak
to your students--

136
00:14:07,023 --> 00:14:07,178
And I'd like to speak
to your students--

137
00:14:07,278 --> 00:14:09,178
Only for a moment, if
you don't mind-- But--

138
00:14:09,278 --> 00:14:12,812
To offer them a rare opportunity
to ply their trade...

139
00:14:12,912 --> 00:14:15,345
and practice
their craft of acting.

140
00:14:15,445 --> 00:14:17,845
And make a little money
while you're doing it.

141
00:14:17,945 --> 00:14:21,012
You know, I'm sort of
a teacher myself, in a way.

142
00:14:21,112 --> 00:14:25,312
They call me
the Professor... of Fear!

143
00:14:25,412 --> 00:14:28,712
Do they give out
degrees in that?

144
00:14:28,812 --> 00:14:33,112
I have created 36...

145
00:14:33,212 --> 00:14:37,022
of the most successful horror
attractions in this country.

146
00:14:37,023 --> 00:14:38,512
Of the most successful horror
attractions in this country.

147
00:14:38,612 --> 00:14:41,645
Ghost Castle. Spookville.

148
00:14:41,745 --> 00:14:43,912
The Ghastly Pit. Terrordome.

149
00:14:44,012 --> 00:14:46,178
Hey, I've been to Spookville.
It's in Florida, right?

150
00:14:46,278 --> 00:14:50,412
Yes. One of my more profitable
enterprises, thank you.

151
00:14:50,512 --> 00:14:54,012
But... I am about to open...

152
00:14:56,045 --> 00:14:58,312
my greatest masterpiece.

153
00:14:58,412 --> 00:15:02,078
My crew has been slaving
around the clock...

154
00:15:02,178 --> 00:15:05,145
to transform the scene
of an infamous local crime...

155
00:15:05,245 --> 00:15:07,022
into a haunted house
for the ages!

156
00:15:07,023 --> 00:15:08,912
Into a haunted house
for the ages!

157
00:15:09,012 --> 00:15:12,612
I am turning
the Darrode foster home into...

158
00:15:12,712 --> 00:15:15,612
Dark House!

159
00:15:16,612 --> 00:15:19,112
- What?
- I've heard of the place.

160
00:15:19,212 --> 00:15:21,645
The, uh-- the lady who ran it
killed, like, 20 kids, right?

161
00:15:21,745 --> 00:15:24,878
Dude, I heard it was 40, and then
they shut that place down for good.

162
00:15:24,978 --> 00:15:27,878
Seriously? Well--

163
00:15:27,978 --> 00:15:31,512
Hey, Claire. You're from here.
What do you know about it?

164
00:15:31,612 --> 00:15:33,512
Nothing. I've never heard of it.

165
00:15:33,612 --> 00:15:35,312
So why am I here?

166
00:15:35,412 --> 00:15:37,022
I have two reporters
from national publications...

167
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:38,345
I have two reporters
from national publications...

168
00:15:38,445 --> 00:15:41,012
coming tomorrow night
to review the show.

169
00:15:41,112 --> 00:15:43,512
And I need actors,
and I need them now,

170
00:15:43,612 --> 00:15:47,412
which is why I'm willing to offer
each and every one of you...

171
00:15:47,512 --> 00:15:50,212
$300 for a day's work,

172
00:15:50,312 --> 00:15:54,178
and if you're good, you'll be
signed on for the whole season.

173
00:15:55,745 --> 00:15:57,678
Do the math.

174
00:15:58,778 --> 00:16:02,178
How many people are working there?
Ten, including you,

175
00:16:02,278 --> 00:16:05,845
if you all agree to join me for tomorrow
night-- more for the real show.

176
00:16:05,945 --> 00:16:07,022
Well, thespians?

177
00:16:07,023 --> 00:16:09,212
Well, thespians?

178
00:16:09,312 --> 00:16:11,378
<i>I don't know. I'm--
I'm a serious actor.</i>

179
00:16:11,478 --> 00:16:14,112
I'm not really interested in doing
some corny show. No offense.

180
00:16:14,212 --> 00:16:18,778
- Ah.
- I really don't want to get fake blood in my hair, so--

181
00:16:18,878 --> 00:16:21,778
Yeah. Hollywood's
gonna typecast me as it is.

182
00:16:21,878 --> 00:16:25,645
Are you guys crazy? You'd pass on
a chance to do a horror movie?

183
00:16:25,745 --> 00:16:28,678
Half of the best actors got
their start in horror movies.

184
00:16:28,778 --> 00:16:31,112
Yeah, but this
isn't a movie.Exactly.

185
00:16:31,212 --> 00:16:33,732
You guys are always bitching about
Caldecote's stupid exercises.

186
00:16:34,912 --> 00:16:37,022
I beg your pardon? Now we get a chance to
actually perform in front of the public,

187
00:16:37,023 --> 00:16:37,578
I beg your pardon? Now we get a chance to
actually perform in front of the public,

188
00:16:37,678 --> 00:16:39,545
and you're gonna be snobs?

189
00:16:39,645 --> 00:16:43,512
Acting is acting. Actors act.

190
00:16:43,612 --> 00:16:47,045
<i>You know what? If-- If Claire's
with it, it's good enough for me.</i>

191
00:16:50,812 --> 00:16:53,678
- I'm in.
- All right. Me too.

192
00:16:53,778 --> 00:16:56,878
I guess I could use the money.

193
00:16:58,412 --> 00:17:00,478
Come on, man.

194
00:17:05,212 --> 00:17:07,022
All right. Whatever. Whatever.
I'd better not regret it.

195
00:17:07,023 --> 00:17:08,878
All right. Whatever. Whatever.
I'd better not regret it.

196
00:17:08,978 --> 00:17:12,345
Excellent! Bravo, all of you!

197
00:17:12,445 --> 00:17:16,845
<i>Well, I will see you tomorrow
morning at Dark House at 9:00 a.m.</i>

198
00:17:16,945 --> 00:17:18,878
Don't be late.

199
00:17:20,045 --> 00:17:23,178
I thank you, sir, for your time.

200
00:17:23,278 --> 00:17:26,145
Players! Play on!

201
00:18:17,245 --> 00:18:19,645
I'm standing in front of
the Darrode foster group home,

202
00:18:19,745 --> 00:18:23,012
where yesterday, seven children
were brutally murdered...

203
00:18:23,112 --> 00:18:25,212
by 50-year-old
Janet Cooper Darrode,

204
00:18:25,312 --> 00:18:28,712
who then took her own life
in gruesome fashion.

205
00:18:28,812 --> 00:18:30,978
No motive has been found
for the killings.

206
00:18:31,078 --> 00:18:33,245
The identities of all the
children have been withheld.

207
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:36,112
From Bridge Haven,
I'm Karen Blake, Cable 8 News.

208
00:19:22,634 --> 00:19:24,567
It's just as creepy
as they said.

209
00:19:24,667 --> 00:19:27,134
Yeah. Victorian architecture
does that every time.

210
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:30,600
Let's go.

211
00:19:40,300 --> 00:19:44,134
So, Lily. I heard you're a dominatrix.
Is that true?

212
00:19:44,234 --> 00:19:47,067
Fuck off, Bruce. Oh, please.
Hurt me more!

213
00:19:47,167 --> 00:19:50,500
<i>How about I just kill you?</i>

214
00:19:58,900 --> 00:20:02,167
- You guys the actors?
- Uh-huh.

215
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:05,700
Come on in.

216
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,022
Okay.

217
00:20:07,023 --> 00:20:08,200
Okay.

218
00:20:08,300 --> 00:20:12,234
I'll be right back. Don't-- Yeah.
You do that. Yeah.

219
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:19,667
Claire, you okay? Yeah.

220
00:20:19,767 --> 00:20:23,067
What are you waiting for?
This is your idea.

221
00:20:23,167 --> 00:20:25,067
Let's go.

222
00:20:30,067 --> 00:20:33,267
Oh, my goodness.
Is that 16th century Etruscan?

223
00:20:33,367 --> 00:20:35,234
Man, it's cold.

224
00:20:37,267 --> 00:20:42,900
Welcome to my latest nightmare,
my thespian friends.

225
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:47,734
Allow me to introduce you to my
brilliant artistic director, Samantha.

226
00:20:47,834 --> 00:20:51,700
Hello-- Ooh. What's your name?

227
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:54,467
Ariel.

228
00:20:54,567 --> 00:20:59,834
And my head usher,
the maleficent Moreton.

229
00:20:59,934 --> 00:21:02,300
You dudes ready to scare
the fuck out of some people?

230
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,500
Yeah, <i>dude.
We can't fuckin' wait.</i>

231
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:07,000
Is it always this cold in here?

232
00:21:07,100 --> 00:21:09,000
No, you're right.
That's strange. It's freezing.

233
00:21:09,100 --> 00:21:11,540
- Maybe somebody left a window open.
- No. That's not possible.

234
00:21:11,567 --> 00:21:16,267
All of the windows are sealed shut
in this house, except for the attic.

235
00:21:16,367 --> 00:21:19,134
We maintain a completely
controlled environment, so--

236
00:21:19,234 --> 00:21:23,100
That way no one here
gets out alive! Rock on!

237
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:25,367
Well, we'll check
the thermostat...

238
00:21:25,467 --> 00:21:27,434
or perhaps
you could wear more clothes.

239
00:21:27,534 --> 00:21:30,413
Or not.

240
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:30,914
Or not.

241
00:22:39,167 --> 00:22:44,000
Ooh. There's time for you to explore the
house later, but we have work to do.

242
00:22:44,100 --> 00:22:46,000
Come on.

243
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:49,800
All right, people. Let's go.
Your time is my money.

244
00:22:49,900 --> 00:22:52,534
Uh, yeah. About that-- Speaking of
which, can we get paid in cash?

245
00:22:52,634 --> 00:22:54,500
Absolutely. After the show.

246
00:22:54,600 --> 00:22:56,767
No problemo, dude.

247
00:22:57,800 --> 00:22:59,734
Looks like you got yourself
a new admirer.

248
00:22:59,834 --> 00:23:00,413
Story of my life.
Man-eater, dyke bait.

249
00:23:00,414 --> 00:23:02,234
Story of my life.
Man-eater, dyke bait.

250
00:23:12,034 --> 00:23:15,434
Ladies and gentlemen,
I present...

251
00:23:15,534 --> 00:23:18,000
the Corridor of Blood.

252
00:23:25,767 --> 00:23:30,413
<i>Excuse me, sir. I thought you said this
was supposed to be your masterpiece.</i>

253
00:23:30,414 --> 00:23:30,434
<i>Excuse me, sir. I thought you said this
was supposed to be your masterpiece.</i>

254
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,834
I-I mean, with all due respect,

255
00:23:32,934 --> 00:23:35,534
<i>Spookville seemed like it had a
lot more going on than this.</i>

256
00:23:38,567 --> 00:23:40,500
Sorry.

257
00:23:40,600 --> 00:23:43,800
You're probably right, but...

258
00:23:43,900 --> 00:23:48,267
sometimes looks
can be deceiving.

259
00:23:48,367 --> 00:23:53,100
<i>I would like the bravest
member of your little group...</i>

260
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,234
to stand right here.

261
00:23:56,334 --> 00:23:58,234
Mm-hmm. Okay.

262
00:24:01,367 --> 00:24:04,534
<i>Ah. Okay. What you got for me?</i>

263
00:24:04,634 --> 00:24:08,300
Say hello to my friend...

264
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,767
Evil Clown.

265
00:24:26,134 --> 00:24:30,167
Hey. Hey, why don't you
get a job at Jack in the Box?

266
00:24:32,567 --> 00:24:35,134
You're not gonna scare me
with some rubber ax!

267
00:24:40,934 --> 00:24:43,567
Oh. Mofo the Clown
ain't playin' around, man.

268
00:24:43,667 --> 00:24:46,100
Well, neither am I,
so bring it on, Bozo!

269
00:24:50,267 --> 00:24:52,900
<i>Gone up against linebackers
way tougher than you!</i>

270
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:05,200
Oh, dude. You just got punked!

271
00:25:05,300 --> 00:25:07,500
Oh, my God. Rudy. Are you okay?

272
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:09,634
Fine.

273
00:25:09,734 --> 00:25:11,800
That was amazing. That was amazing.
What the hell was it?

274
00:25:11,900 --> 00:25:15,367
It was the world's most advanced
holographic illusion system.

275
00:25:15,467 --> 00:25:19,167
- <i>I thought that holographs were clear like ghosts.
- Yeah.</i>

276
00:25:19,267 --> 00:25:20,967
Not any more.

277
00:25:21,067 --> 00:25:23,800
My technicians
have spent the last month...

278
00:25:23,900 --> 00:25:29,234
installing over 2,000 laser image
projectors all over this building.

279
00:25:29,334 --> 00:25:30,413
We can project anything anywhere
inside the walls of Dark House...

280
00:25:30,414 --> 00:25:34,500
We can project anything anywhere
inside the walls of Dark House...

281
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:37,800
and make it look
absolutely real.

282
00:25:37,900 --> 00:25:39,934
But wait. There's more. Oh?

283
00:25:40,034 --> 00:25:44,134
Infrared sensors are set to
trigger the holographs...

284
00:25:44,234 --> 00:25:47,367
any time they sense
extreme excitement or--

285
00:25:47,467 --> 00:25:49,700
Fear. Fear.

286
00:25:49,800 --> 00:25:53,900
Oh! Or if not, we can use this
handy little remote control.

287
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,767
We have a library
of over 100 creepy characters.

288
00:25:56,867 --> 00:25:59,434
<i>Designed by yours truly.</i>

289
00:25:59,534 --> 00:26:00,413
No applause necessary.

290
00:26:00,414 --> 00:26:01,900
No applause necessary.

291
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:04,234
Check this out.

292
00:26:09,100 --> 00:26:11,867
- Oh, yeah.
- Sweet. Brain eaters.

293
00:26:14,267 --> 00:26:16,500
- Cool!
- That is bad-ass.

294
00:26:16,600 --> 00:26:18,800
Yeah. Different fiends
come at you every time.

295
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:21,300
It's fuckin' great
for repeat business.

296
00:26:24,100 --> 00:26:26,834
Now, you actors
will be our hosts...

297
00:26:26,934 --> 00:26:29,634
and play characters that
interact with the holographs.

298
00:26:29,734 --> 00:26:30,413
Moreton will show you
everything you need to know.

299
00:26:30,414 --> 00:26:32,374
Moreton will show you
everything you need to know.

300
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:36,000
<i>Can we check out your mainframe?</i>

301
00:26:36,100 --> 00:26:38,867
I mean, you guys must be processing
at least 300 teraflops a second...

302
00:26:38,967 --> 00:26:40,900
to produce
such dynamic 3-D algorithms.

303
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:43,234
You are correct.
Would you like to see it?

304
00:26:43,334 --> 00:26:47,234
Please. Uh, how the hell
did you know all that?

305
00:26:47,334 --> 00:26:49,967
- I read <i>Wired.
- Follow me.</i>

306
00:26:50,067 --> 00:26:52,934
Uh, not often, just--

307
00:26:59,867 --> 00:27:00,413
Harris, we're not alone.

308
00:27:00,414 --> 00:27:02,934
Harris, we're not alone.

309
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:04,700
♪

310
00:27:08,734 --> 00:27:11,767
<i>Oh. You're not
feeling well, are you?</i>

311
00:27:11,867 --> 00:27:15,400
Why don't you just go ahead and go home,
and I'll take care of Rudy for you.

312
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:19,867
Oh, my goodness, ladies and gentlemen.
The IBM Blue Gene.

313
00:27:19,967 --> 00:27:21,867
This sucker's a multi-cluster,
hyper-threading,

314
00:27:21,967 --> 00:27:24,267
symmetric multi-processing
monster, ladies and gentlemen.

315
00:27:24,367 --> 00:27:26,967
This is a piece of work.

316
00:27:27,067 --> 00:27:30,413
You are the biggest fucking nerd sometimes.
It's embarrassing, man.

317
00:27:30,414 --> 00:27:30,967
You are the biggest fucking nerd sometimes.
It's embarrassing, man.

318
00:27:31,067 --> 00:27:33,334
Thank you for saying that
so I didn't have to.

319
00:27:33,434 --> 00:27:37,434
<i>Both of you promote the idiot male
stereotype every time you open your mouth.</i>

320
00:27:37,534 --> 00:27:40,900
- Oh, you're sweet.
- Preach.

321
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:43,600
Is there a reason you're bringing
tourists down here, Walston?

322
00:27:43,700 --> 00:27:47,800
I didn't want to deprive our new actors of
your scintillating personality, Harris.

323
00:27:47,900 --> 00:27:51,667
This is Harris, our
unquestionably brilliant,

324
00:27:51,767 --> 00:27:55,100
visionary creator of the
holographic illusion system.

325
00:27:59,667 --> 00:28:00,413
You!

326
00:28:00,414 --> 00:28:01,634
You!

327
00:28:01,734 --> 00:28:04,867
You get out!

328
00:28:06,834 --> 00:28:10,500
- Do you mind?
- Oh.

329
00:28:10,600 --> 00:28:13,534
The only thing Harris dislikes more
than his fellow human beings...

330
00:28:13,634 --> 00:28:18,067
is the fact that he has to come to an evil
capitalist like me in order to fund his research.

331
00:28:18,167 --> 00:28:21,767
- Isn't that true, Harris?
- I don't dislike everyone, Walston.

332
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:25,334
Mainly just you.

333
00:28:25,434 --> 00:28:30,413
All right. Moving on. Let us, uh, go
back upstairs to get our scripts,

334
00:28:30,414 --> 00:28:30,434
All right. Moving on. Let us, uh, go
back upstairs to get our scripts,

335
00:28:30,534 --> 00:28:32,300
change into our costumes
and rehearse!

336
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:35,467
Reporters will be here before we
know it, so time is of the essence.

337
00:28:35,567 --> 00:28:37,300
Let's go, go, go!

338
00:28:37,400 --> 00:28:40,567
Awesome. Awesome. Thank you very much.
We have to move.

339
00:29:01,834 --> 00:29:03,634
Ow! Ow!

340
00:29:39,467 --> 00:29:41,867
Leave him alone!

341
00:29:45,167 --> 00:29:47,967
What the fuck
are you looking at?

342
00:30:02,334 --> 00:30:06,334
Knew they were gonna cast me
as the fucking witch.

343
00:30:06,434 --> 00:30:08,167
So goddamn predictable, I swear.

344
00:30:08,267 --> 00:30:10,967
Oh, and guess who gets to play
the damsel in distress.

345
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:17,000
Yep, Miss Blonde
Waste of Space, Ariel.

346
00:30:17,100 --> 00:30:20,167
I don't know why you let that
bitch talk so much shit to you.

347
00:30:22,967 --> 00:30:25,534
What's the mirror
covered up for?

348
00:30:25,634 --> 00:30:28,267
I... just didn't feel like
looking at myself.

349
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:30,414
Oh.

350
00:30:30,415 --> 00:30:31,400
Oh.

351
00:30:32,467 --> 00:30:34,967
Have you read this cheesy-ass
shit that we have to say?

352
00:30:35,067 --> 00:30:37,400
Moreton the gore geek thinks
it's better than Shakespeare.

353
00:30:40,134 --> 00:30:45,234
Well, at least-- at least you're a cool
character. They made me a fear guide.

354
00:30:45,334 --> 00:30:49,634
So, Rudy's been grilling me
about how you feel about him.

355
00:30:50,567 --> 00:30:52,734
How am I supposed to know?

356
00:30:54,667 --> 00:30:56,600
So what's the deal
with that, anyway?

357
00:30:56,700 --> 00:30:59,434
I mean, obviously
the guy's nuts about you...

358
00:30:59,534 --> 00:31:00,413
and I love that, because
it makes Ariel miserable.

359
00:31:00,414 --> 00:31:03,400
And I love that, because
it makes Ariel miserable.

360
00:31:03,500 --> 00:31:07,834
I don't know. I really... have too much to
deal with to worry about guys right now.

361
00:31:10,167 --> 00:31:12,800
You know why you're the only
one in class I can trust? Why?

362
00:31:12,900 --> 00:31:16,600
Because you're even more
fucked up than I am.

363
00:31:17,967 --> 00:31:19,734
Thanks.

364
00:31:19,834 --> 00:31:23,034
We've both been members of
the self-slicers of America.

365
00:31:27,934 --> 00:31:30,413
I never noticed.
I wear long pants.

366
00:31:30,414 --> 00:31:31,834
I never noticed.
I wear long pants.

367
00:31:33,434 --> 00:31:37,700
Hey, have you ever tried Welbutrin?
I highly recommend it.

368
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:41,467
I've tried Paxil, but you just absolutely
cannot come with that stuff in you,

369
00:31:41,567 --> 00:31:43,600
and then you just
get depressed all over again.

370
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,767
I'll try and remember that.
All right.

371
00:31:46,867 --> 00:31:49,167
Well, I'm gonna
go to the bathroom,

372
00:31:49,267 --> 00:31:52,567
because I need a mirror
to put this together.

373
00:32:21,448 --> 00:32:24,315
I-- I tripped.

374
00:32:27,548 --> 00:32:30,730
People ask me... "Why fear?"

375
00:32:30,830 --> 00:32:35,130
But to me, that's like asking,
"Why food and water?

376
00:32:35,230 --> 00:32:38,497
The stimulation of terror,

377
00:32:38,597 --> 00:32:40,663
the quickening of the blood,

378
00:32:40,763 --> 00:32:42,697
the rapid breath
of anticipation,

379
00:32:42,797 --> 00:32:45,797
<i>the activation of
the fight-or-flight response...</i>

380
00:32:45,897 --> 00:32:48,963
<i>are all part of our sustenance.</i>

381
00:32:49,063 --> 00:32:54,363
Human beings seek danger and
the resulting fear because...

382
00:32:54,463 --> 00:32:57,403
it's what makes us truly alive.

383
00:32:57,404 --> 00:32:58,397
It's what makes us truly alive.

384
00:32:58,497 --> 00:33:01,963
Oh, God! Preach it, Walston! Oh!

385
00:33:02,063 --> 00:33:03,530
Feel the fear.

386
00:33:03,630 --> 00:33:06,597
So often,
the glorious rush of fear...

387
00:33:06,697 --> 00:33:09,963
can only be obtained
by risking life and limb.

388
00:33:10,063 --> 00:33:13,997
<i>But throughout human history,</i>

389
00:33:14,097 --> 00:33:19,697
we few-- we happy few,
we entertainers--

390
00:33:19,797 --> 00:33:24,363
<i>We have been charged with providing
the release of that fear...</i>

391
00:33:24,463 --> 00:33:27,030
in a safe and harmless way.

392
00:33:27,130 --> 00:33:27,404
We are the merchants of
adrenaline in a civilized world.

393
00:33:27,405 --> 00:33:32,397
We are the merchants of
adrenaline in a civilized world.

394
00:33:32,497 --> 00:33:35,030
Through us, people can face
their worst fears...

395
00:33:35,130 --> 00:33:36,897
and live to tell the tale.

396
00:33:36,997 --> 00:33:41,163
Through us, they can die
a thousand deaths...

397
00:33:41,263 --> 00:33:45,730
and... truly live.

398
00:33:46,630 --> 00:33:48,563
This guy loves his work.

399
00:33:48,663 --> 00:33:50,797
Impress those reporters tonight.

400
00:33:50,897 --> 00:33:54,563
Be proud
you're in a horror show.

401
00:33:54,663 --> 00:33:57,403
Know your lines well.
Perform them with passion.

402
00:33:57,404 --> 00:33:58,463
Know your lines well.
Perform them with passion.

403
00:33:58,563 --> 00:34:04,663
And above all, always--
Always-- leave them screaming!

404
00:34:24,963 --> 00:34:26,597
What the hell?

405
00:34:28,263 --> 00:34:30,730
What the--

406
00:34:38,930 --> 00:34:41,563
Who the hell
put you in my system?

407
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:54,763
I'm gonna have to reboot
the whole damn system.

408
00:34:54,863 --> 00:34:56,763
Damn it!

409
00:35:04,830 --> 00:35:07,597
Harris.

410
00:35:10,563 --> 00:35:13,697
<i>Harris. The hell?</i>

411
00:35:18,097 --> 00:35:19,830
What's that?

412
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:23,397
Harris.

413
00:35:41,230 --> 00:35:44,563
<i>I've reviewed over 200 Halloween haunts
for Fright Night magazine, Walston.</i>

414
00:35:44,663 --> 00:35:46,730
You used to have the top five
attractions in the country,

415
00:35:46,830 --> 00:35:48,730
but people think
you're falling off now.

416
00:35:48,830 --> 00:35:51,697
The effects over at Graveside
in Seattle absolutely rule.

417
00:35:51,797 --> 00:35:55,330
<i>So? Is this the place that's
gonna put you back on top?</i>

418
00:35:55,430 --> 00:35:57,403
I have never left the top.

419
00:35:57,404 --> 00:35:58,263
I have never left the top.

420
00:35:58,363 --> 00:36:00,530
But once you've experienced
Dark House,

421
00:36:00,630 --> 00:36:05,030
your readers will know that I have
raised the bar to the stratosphere.

422
00:36:05,130 --> 00:36:07,097
Well, we'll see about that.

423
00:36:07,197 --> 00:36:12,363
My readers at <i>U.S.A. News will be more concerned
about your exploitation of a tragedy.</i>

424
00:36:12,463 --> 00:36:16,297
I'm not sure that the use of the
word "exploitation" is quite fair.

425
00:36:16,397 --> 00:36:19,930
And when you say "my readers" are
concerned, Paula, don't you mean you?

426
00:36:20,030 --> 00:36:22,230
Seven children were brutally
killed in this house.

427
00:36:22,330 --> 00:36:24,097
That's common knowledge.
Well, it is,

428
00:36:24,197 --> 00:36:26,797
now that you've plastered the details
of the massacre all over the Internet.

429
00:36:26,897 --> 00:36:27,403
I haven't used
the names of the victims.

430
00:36:27,404 --> 00:36:29,097
I haven't used
the names of the victims.

431
00:36:30,863 --> 00:36:32,797
But you're taking advantage of the murder of
children to sell tickets to a horror attraction.

432
00:36:32,897 --> 00:36:34,997
You don't see
anything wrong with that?

433
00:36:36,830 --> 00:36:38,630
<i>Not any more than you writing about
it in order to sell magazines.</i>

434
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:40,763
<i>It's merely background.</i>

435
00:36:40,863 --> 00:36:42,830
The tragic events
that occurred in this house...

436
00:36:42,930 --> 00:36:45,263
are not mentioned,
they're not referred to,

437
00:36:45,363 --> 00:36:47,463
they're not depicted
in any way in my show.

438
00:36:47,563 --> 00:36:49,997
I don't know why not.
Ghostly kids are pretty freaky.

439
00:36:51,130 --> 00:36:53,930
<i>Paula, all I ask is that
you keep an open mind,</i>

440
00:36:54,030 --> 00:36:55,930
<i>and whatever moral
judgments you may have,</i>

441
00:36:56,030 --> 00:36:57,403
just report accurately
whether my show is scary or not.

442
00:36:57,404 --> 00:36:59,363
Just report accurately
whether my show is scary or not.

443
00:36:59,463 --> 00:37:02,063
That's fair, isn't it?

444
00:37:03,297 --> 00:37:07,863
- Okay. Let's see what you've got here.
- Splendid.

445
00:37:18,197 --> 00:37:20,130
Here we go.

446
00:37:20,230 --> 00:37:23,397
Dark House is under way.
Mmm-hmm.

447
00:37:23,497 --> 00:37:27,403
And now,
let the frightmare begin.

448
00:37:27,404 --> 00:37:27,463
And now,
let the frightmare begin.

449
00:37:27,563 --> 00:37:31,263
Allow me to introduce
your host this evening:

450
00:37:31,363 --> 00:37:33,330
The Shroud!

451
00:37:33,430 --> 00:37:35,530
Welcome to Dark House,

452
00:37:35,630 --> 00:37:39,263
the most evil house
on the East Coast.

453
00:37:39,363 --> 00:37:42,963
<i>In just a moment, you'll
witness horrors so freakish,</i>

454
00:37:43,063 --> 00:37:45,997
terrors so mind-bending...

455
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:49,997
that I can't promise
you'll leave with your sanity...

456
00:37:50,097 --> 00:37:52,597
or your life.

457
00:37:52,697 --> 00:37:54,630
Welcome to Dark House.

458
00:37:54,730 --> 00:37:57,403
It's time to face your fears.

459
00:37:57,404 --> 00:37:58,564
It's time to face your fears.

460
00:38:02,463 --> 00:38:04,463
Yes! Now that is bad-ass!

461
00:38:04,563 --> 00:38:06,463
Have these bats
been checked for rabies?

462
00:38:06,563 --> 00:38:09,663
Ascend. Come on. Let's go.

463
00:38:11,163 --> 00:38:16,630
Hey. I like to improvise a lot, so
just roll with the punches. Thanks.

464
00:38:34,563 --> 00:38:37,030
<i>What in the hell?</i>

465
00:38:43,763 --> 00:38:47,497
Down the Corridor of Blood
lurk the Six Rooms of Doom.

466
00:38:47,597 --> 00:38:52,763
But to get there, you must first get
past the beings that guard the hallways.

467
00:38:55,597 --> 00:38:57,403
Oh.

468
00:38:57,404 --> 00:38:58,963
Oh.

469
00:39:01,363 --> 00:39:07,130
Yeah. Wow. Stand back. We must
repel this underworld spawn.

470
00:39:10,297 --> 00:39:14,130
Begone, foul wraith!
Back to hell!

471
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:27,403
Oh, shit!

472
00:39:27,404 --> 00:39:27,930
Oh, shit!

473
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:35,430
Fuck!

474
00:39:42,897 --> 00:39:47,263
Wow! Nailed him!

475
00:39:47,363 --> 00:39:50,063
It's so real. Yeah.

476
00:39:50,163 --> 00:39:53,997
All right. Let's get going before
the wraith comes back for us.

477
00:39:54,097 --> 00:39:56,763
Yeah. I'm with that. Please
lead the-- Go. Uh, yeah.

478
00:39:56,863 --> 00:39:57,403
- <i>Way to bleed out, dude.
- You're disgusting.</i>

479
00:39:57,404 --> 00:40:00,897
- <i>Way to bleed out, dude.
- You're disgusting.</i>

480
00:40:09,463 --> 00:40:12,297
Moreton, you asshole.

481
00:40:23,097 --> 00:40:26,963
My name... is Thaddeus Payne,

482
00:40:27,063 --> 00:40:27,404
and I'm a mortician...

483
00:40:27,405 --> 00:40:29,663
and I'm a mortician...

484
00:40:29,763 --> 00:40:33,063
who specializes in
the internment of the damned.

485
00:40:33,163 --> 00:40:36,997
Please step forward and see the body of
a sadistic killer of 93 innocent women.

486
00:40:38,997 --> 00:40:41,863
What's different about
preparing the damned for burial?

487
00:40:41,963 --> 00:40:44,197
The body must be sealed,

488
00:40:44,297 --> 00:40:49,497
with every orifice
tightly sewn shut.

489
00:40:49,597 --> 00:40:52,930
And if the body's not sealed?

490
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:54,830
The damned soul will escape.

491
00:41:00,597 --> 00:41:02,197
Wanna see?

492
00:41:02,297 --> 00:41:04,763
Uh, yeah. Yeah. Totally.

493
00:41:19,297 --> 00:41:21,430
Be released.

494
00:41:29,609 --> 00:41:32,475
God! Get away from me!

495
00:41:32,575 --> 00:41:36,109
It's like they can see us!

496
00:41:36,209 --> 00:41:39,442
Let's get out of here
while we still can.

497
00:41:39,542 --> 00:41:42,742
What in the hell
is going on up there?

498
00:41:42,842 --> 00:41:46,042
Do you realize how much money
I have sunk into this place?

499
00:41:46,142 --> 00:41:47,875
Well, why don't you just relax?

500
00:41:47,975 --> 00:41:50,742
I mean, it's out of our
control right now. What?

501
00:41:50,842 --> 00:41:53,909
Asking me to relax is like
asking you to sleep with a man!

502
00:41:55,175 --> 00:41:57,973
It's against my nature.

503
00:41:57,974 --> 00:41:58,894
It's against my nature.

504
00:41:59,742 --> 00:42:02,742
Please. Please help me.

505
00:42:02,842 --> 00:42:07,942
<i>Help me!
Dad's gonna kill me! Help!</i>

506
00:42:08,042 --> 00:42:10,975
Be afraid. Run for your lives.

507
00:42:11,075 --> 00:42:13,942
Be very afraid. <i>Get out.</i>

508
00:42:14,042 --> 00:42:17,342
Help me. Please help me.
Help me.

509
00:42:17,442 --> 00:42:19,375
<i>Please help me.</i>

510
00:42:19,475 --> 00:42:22,909
He's gonna
cut me up next. Please help.

511
00:42:23,009 --> 00:42:25,309
Please help!

512
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:27,973
- Daddy, I love you.
- There's no escape.

513
00:42:27,974 --> 00:42:29,574
- Daddy, I love you.
- There's no escape.

514
00:42:30,442 --> 00:42:33,042
Get out. Get out while you can.

515
00:42:33,142 --> 00:42:34,875
<i>Run!</i>

516
00:42:34,975 --> 00:42:39,342
Please help me! He's gonna
cut me up next! Please!

517
00:42:44,009 --> 00:42:48,775
The prisoners who are kept here are
of a very dangerous type-- vampires.

518
00:42:48,875 --> 00:42:51,275
Heed the warning.

519
00:42:54,109 --> 00:42:57,775
You know, when a sign says "Do
not cross," we got to cross it.

520
00:42:57,875 --> 00:42:57,974
Come on. No. No!

521
00:42:57,975 --> 00:42:59,409
Come on. No. No!

522
00:43:03,375 --> 00:43:05,309
Do not do that again!

523
00:43:05,409 --> 00:43:07,109
Would you relax?

524
00:43:07,209 --> 00:43:10,809
That was-- You almost got me that time.
That was awesome. Wow.

525
00:43:10,909 --> 00:43:13,442
Okay. Let's move on. Yeah.

526
00:43:24,342 --> 00:43:27,973
No!

527
00:43:27,974 --> 00:43:29,575
No!

528
00:43:33,275 --> 00:43:36,675
No! No! Ohh!

529
00:43:38,742 --> 00:43:43,975
<i>Leave me alone! Leave me alone!</i>

530
00:43:44,075 --> 00:43:47,809
Oh, now we're talking. Some
mark of the devil action. Yeah!

531
00:43:49,375 --> 00:43:53,609
- This is terrible.
- <i>These criminals don't deserve your sympathy.</i>

532
00:43:53,709 --> 00:43:56,809
- I'm innocent!
- <i>The choice is yours, sir.</i>

533
00:43:56,909 --> 00:43:57,973
Thumbs up or thumbs down?
<i>Please. Don't do it.</i>

534
00:43:57,974 --> 00:44:00,042
Thumbs up or thumbs down?
<i>Please. Don't do it.</i>

535
00:44:00,142 --> 00:44:03,342
<i>I'm innocent. Innocent.</i>

536
00:44:04,175 --> 00:44:05,275
Yeah. <i>No!</i>

537
00:44:05,375 --> 00:44:09,075
- A wise decision.
- No, don't do it.

538
00:44:09,175 --> 00:44:12,309
Don't!

539
00:44:14,975 --> 00:44:18,975
I've brought two more
sacrifices for you, Zimba.

540
00:44:19,075 --> 00:44:24,842
Come, my children, to the center of
the star. The Sabbath is at hand.

541
00:44:26,609 --> 00:44:27,973
Come, come.

542
00:44:27,974 --> 00:44:28,609
Come, come.

543
00:44:29,675 --> 00:44:32,142
You.

544
00:44:32,242 --> 00:44:35,242
Your fate is clear to me,
my dear.

545
00:44:36,542 --> 00:44:39,309
I see you married to a corpse...

546
00:44:39,409 --> 00:44:41,675
and living in a grave.

547
00:44:41,775 --> 00:44:46,275
But wait. Do you hear that?

548
00:44:48,242 --> 00:44:51,542
The coven arrives.

549
00:44:51,642 --> 00:44:54,209
You're doomed.

550
00:45:37,375 --> 00:45:42,442
Sometimes to find a cure,
sacrifices must be made.

551
00:45:42,542 --> 00:45:45,242
In this room, a dedicated
scientist searches...

552
00:45:45,342 --> 00:45:48,175
for new ways
to end human suffering.

553
00:45:48,275 --> 00:45:50,742
A quest--

554
00:45:50,842 --> 00:45:54,342
Which, at times,
requires human suffering.

555
00:46:02,442 --> 00:46:07,742
I've invented a new fluid that will make
scalpels unnecessary during surgery.

556
00:46:17,242 --> 00:46:20,709
Allow me to demonstrate.

557
00:46:47,742 --> 00:46:50,209
Observe the results.

558
00:46:55,542 --> 00:46:57,609
<i>Oh, wow.</i>

559
00:46:58,942 --> 00:47:03,509
<i>I know this is a hologram,
but this looks so real.</i>

560
00:47:14,409 --> 00:47:17,042
- Oh, cut the shit, Reed.
- This isn't a trick!

561
00:47:17,142 --> 00:47:23,409
Go get help! Go! Go get help!
Hurry! Hurry! Go! Go!

562
00:47:23,509 --> 00:47:25,542
Oh, God!

563
00:47:28,909 --> 00:47:30,842
Oh, my God!

564
00:47:42,309 --> 00:47:44,509
Miss Cummings.

565
00:47:46,109 --> 00:47:49,209
Help! Somebody, help!

566
00:47:49,309 --> 00:47:51,409
Help! Claire?

567
00:47:51,509 --> 00:47:55,809
Help! Somebody!

568
00:47:57,942 --> 00:47:57,972
<i>- Fuck!
- That's just makeup, isn't it? Tell me that's just makeup.</i>

569
00:47:57,973 --> 00:48:00,709
<i>- Fuck!
- That's just makeup, isn't it? Tell me that's just makeup.</i>

570
00:48:00,809 --> 00:48:04,742
- Oh, my God.
- <i>Oh, Jesus. What happened?</i>

571
00:48:04,842 --> 00:48:10,775
The mad scientist threw acid in his face!
He threw acid!

572
00:48:10,875 --> 00:48:12,809
That's impossible. The mad
scientist is-- It's a hologram.

573
00:48:12,909 --> 00:48:14,875
Yeah. So is the acid.
They're just illusions.

574
00:48:14,975 --> 00:48:19,009
You look at his face and you tell
me that is an illusion! He is dead!

575
00:48:19,109 --> 00:48:22,009
Please! Please!

576
00:48:22,109 --> 00:48:24,209
Shit! Help me!

577
00:48:24,309 --> 00:48:26,575
You got to help me! Please!

578
00:48:26,675 --> 00:48:27,973
Okay, she's dead.

579
00:48:27,974 --> 00:48:28,842
Okay, she's dead.

580
00:48:28,942 --> 00:48:31,842
- A reporter for a national magazine is dead.
- This is terrible.

581
00:48:31,942 --> 00:48:35,875
Yeah, no kidding. Publicity
is going to be disastrous.

582
00:48:35,975 --> 00:48:39,309
What-- Not to mention that
she's a human being, Walston.

583
00:48:39,409 --> 00:48:42,642
- Aah! Shit! Shit!
- <i>Thumbs up! Thumbs up!</i>

584
00:48:42,742 --> 00:48:45,109
Thumbs up! Thumbs up! Thumbs up!
Thumbs up! No! No! No!

585
00:48:45,209 --> 00:48:47,609
Thumbs up! Thumbs up!
Thumbs up! Thumbs up!

586
00:48:47,709 --> 00:48:52,209
<i>No! Thumbs up! I'm gonna go find
out what's going on up there.</i>

587
00:48:54,275 --> 00:48:57,542
- What?
- Okay, okay, okay. Get over there,

588
00:48:57,642 --> 00:48:57,974
and you're gonna help me
put her on the couch.

589
00:48:57,975 --> 00:48:59,775
And you're gonna help me
put her on the couch.

590
00:48:59,809 --> 00:49:02,675
Yeah, we wouldn't want the press
to find her lying on the ground.

591
00:49:02,775 --> 00:49:04,475
Oh, shut up.

592
00:49:04,575 --> 00:49:08,175
Come on. Ready?

593
00:49:08,275 --> 00:49:10,409
Thumbs up! Thumbs up! Stop!

594
00:49:10,509 --> 00:49:13,909
What are you guys doing?
Who's the idiot in the kilt?

595
00:49:14,009 --> 00:49:16,375
- That idiot can really hurt Bruce.
- Please.

596
00:49:16,475 --> 00:49:17,909
Stop! Thumbs up! Thumbs up!

597
00:49:18,009 --> 00:49:21,442
- <i>Don't let him close it!
- All right, all right! Enough!</i>

598
00:49:21,542 --> 00:49:23,442
Bruce, you're scaring everybody.

599
00:49:23,542 --> 00:49:25,942
You got to help me! Please!

600
00:49:26,042 --> 00:49:27,973
<i>Please!</i>

601
00:49:27,974 --> 00:49:28,309
<i>Please!</i>

602
00:49:28,409 --> 00:49:30,909
- No!
- <i>Stop!</i>

603
00:49:33,409 --> 00:49:35,842
Go get him out.

604
00:49:40,809 --> 00:49:45,575
Fuck. He's dead.
How could this happen?

605
00:49:45,675 --> 00:49:47,509
- I can't believe it.
- Oh, fuck.

606
00:49:47,609 --> 00:49:50,842
It's her! It's Miss Darrode!

607
00:49:52,975 --> 00:49:55,175
Oh, man. That was--

608
00:49:57,075 --> 00:49:57,973
Damn.

609
00:49:57,974 --> 00:50:00,842
Damn.

610
00:50:00,942 --> 00:50:05,375
There might be a way for us to spin
this to our benefit. Listen to this.

611
00:50:05,475 --> 00:50:10,542
"Famous reporter scared to death
in haunted attraction."

612
00:50:10,642 --> 00:50:13,409
That could work. That could pack 'em in.
What do you think?

613
00:50:14,742 --> 00:50:16,742
Wow.

614
00:50:19,975 --> 00:50:21,675
Claire! Claire!

615
00:50:21,775 --> 00:50:23,742
She's having a panic attack.
Shh, shh, shh.

616
00:50:23,842 --> 00:50:27,642
Claire. Claire. Claire.
Shh. Breathe, okay? Breathe.

617
00:50:27,742 --> 00:50:27,974
Breathe. We need you to be
here with us, okay? Breathe.

618
00:50:27,975 --> 00:50:29,809
Breathe. We need you to be
here with us, okay? Breathe.

619
00:50:29,909 --> 00:50:33,709
Listen, I don't know what the hell is going
on, but we got to get off of this floor!

620
00:50:33,809 --> 00:50:37,642
Look, he's right. We got to go.
Come on. Come on!

621
00:50:41,175 --> 00:50:43,375
Whoa!

622
00:50:44,242 --> 00:50:46,675
What is this?

623
00:50:47,642 --> 00:50:49,842
What the hell
are you people doing?

624
00:50:49,942 --> 00:50:52,842
What the hell are you doing? One of
your holograms has killed two people!

625
00:50:52,942 --> 00:50:56,342
Hey! Are you insane? No, seriously, dude.
We just all saw it happen.

626
00:50:56,442 --> 00:50:57,973
That fucking thing just closed on Bruce!
It didn't even give him a goddamn chance!

627
00:50:57,974 --> 00:50:59,442
That fucking thing just closed on Bruce!
It didn't even give him a goddamn chance!

628
00:50:59,542 --> 00:51:01,675
A chance to get
ventilated is all!

629
00:51:01,775 --> 00:51:03,742
What the hell happened to her?

630
00:51:05,309 --> 00:51:06,509
- <i>She fell down the stairs, broke her neck.
- It was an accident.</i>

631
00:51:07,709 --> 00:51:09,442
No, it wasn't. One of your
holograms must have pushed her.

632
00:51:09,542 --> 00:51:11,675
What? <i>Okay, look. Listen. Okay?</i>

633
00:51:11,775 --> 00:51:16,042
Holograms are illusions created by laser
light. Okay, that's all they are.

634
00:51:16,142 --> 00:51:18,909
Okay, a bad accident
has happened here,

635
00:51:19,009 --> 00:51:21,575
which has made everyone naturally a
little upset <i>and a little confused.</i>

636
00:51:21,675 --> 00:51:23,835
- I'm not getting a signal.
- <i>I'm off-network. - Me too.</i>

637
00:51:23,842 --> 00:51:25,875
- Shit!
- Walston, call the police on the landline.

638
00:51:27,609 --> 00:51:27,974
I already tried that. The lines are down. We
have some sort of strange interference going--

639
00:51:27,975 --> 00:51:29,409
I already tried that. The lines are down. We
have some sort of strange interference going--

640
00:51:29,509 --> 00:51:32,242
Fucking interference! We're
staying alive, is that clear?

641
00:51:32,342 --> 00:51:35,542
- Let's all discuss this calmly.
- I'm getting the fuck out of here, man.

642
00:51:35,642 --> 00:51:38,542
- Wait, wait, wait.
- You are a psycho!

643
00:51:41,909 --> 00:51:44,975
Walston, unlock this fucking
door before I break it down!

644
00:51:45,075 --> 00:51:48,175
Well, it shouldn't be locked.
It opens from the inside. <i>- Fuck!</i>

645
00:51:51,209 --> 00:51:54,242
- Oh, fuck!
- Eldon, watch out! Turn around!

646
00:51:55,709 --> 00:51:57,742
<i>Turn it off!</i>

647
00:51:57,842 --> 00:51:57,974
- <i>Eldon!
- Move!</i>

648
00:51:57,975 --> 00:51:59,909
- <i>Eldon!
- Move!</i>

649
00:52:02,009 --> 00:52:04,175
- I got to get you out of here.
- Turn it off!

650
00:52:04,275 --> 00:52:07,442
<i>Stop! Wait! Rudy.</i>

651
00:52:07,542 --> 00:52:09,642
God, why won't it open?

652
00:52:11,942 --> 00:52:15,675
Fuck! Shit! Come on!

653
00:52:19,775 --> 00:52:22,675
<i>Something's wrong.
Oh, my God! Don't!</i>

654
00:52:24,575 --> 00:52:27,973
Rudy, listen to me.
It's not the holographs.

655
00:52:27,974 --> 00:52:28,275
Rudy, listen to me.
It's not the holographs.

656
00:52:28,375 --> 00:52:32,009
It's the woman who killed all those
kids-- the spirit of Miss Darrode.

657
00:52:32,109 --> 00:52:33,875
What is going on?
I have no idea.

658
00:52:33,975 --> 00:52:36,542
Can't somebody turn
this fucking thing off!

659
00:52:36,642 --> 00:52:39,342
<i>Make it stop!</i>

660
00:52:41,375 --> 00:52:44,175
- Hah!
- Get him, Eldon!

661
00:52:44,275 --> 00:52:47,109
All right, ugly.
I'm done fuckin' running!

662
00:52:47,209 --> 00:52:51,142
I saw her. Right before Bruce and
Reed were killed, I saw her.

663
00:52:51,242 --> 00:52:52,482
- Claire, no!
- <i>Come on, fucker!</i>

664
00:52:52,509 --> 00:52:54,742
Eldon! Shit! Come on!

665
00:52:54,842 --> 00:52:57,709
- Let's do this!
- Eldon!

666
00:53:11,675 --> 00:53:14,742
That's impossible. We got to get
out of this fucking crazy place.

667
00:53:14,842 --> 00:53:16,742
How the fuck do we get out
of here, Walston?

668
00:53:16,842 --> 00:53:19,442
The doors are locked!
The windows are bricked up!

669
00:53:19,542 --> 00:53:24,775
Everybody, shut up! There's
nothing we can do about it now.

670
00:53:24,875 --> 00:53:27,973
Come with me if you want to live.
Come on.

671
00:53:27,974 --> 00:53:28,042
Come with me if you want to live.
Come on.

672
00:53:28,142 --> 00:53:31,709
- Samantha, now where the hell are you going?
- Fuck you, Walston!

673
00:53:31,809 --> 00:53:35,042
What the fuck are we gonna do now?
Let's get the fuck out of here.

674
00:53:35,142 --> 00:53:35,254
Come, come, come.
Where are we going?

675
00:53:35,255 --> 00:53:37,242
Come, come, come.
Where are we going?

676
00:53:37,342 --> 00:53:40,382
There's an unlocked window in this
bathroom. I think we can get out this way.

677
00:53:40,442 --> 00:53:42,142
Well, what about the others?

678
00:53:42,242 --> 00:53:45,809
One of the others is some kind of maniac.
I don't know what happened back there,

679
00:53:45,909 --> 00:53:47,809
but holograms do not kill.

680
00:53:47,909 --> 00:53:51,742
What is fucking happening? I don't know.
Just help me with this window.

681
00:53:51,842 --> 00:53:54,742
How do you know
I'm not the maniac?

682
00:53:54,842 --> 00:53:56,242
Because you're too cute.

683
00:53:56,342 --> 00:53:59,742
So if you get me out of here alive,
does that mean I have to do you?

684
00:53:59,842 --> 00:54:01,309
Yes. Okay.

685
00:54:01,409 --> 00:54:04,542
Okay.

686
00:54:15,642 --> 00:54:18,275
It's not gonna open!

687
00:54:18,375 --> 00:54:21,542
Yeah, no kidding. I told you.
It's a security door!

688
00:54:21,642 --> 00:54:24,009
You're gonna need a battering
ram to take it down.

689
00:54:24,109 --> 00:54:26,809
<i>It's her. She won't let us out.</i>

690
00:54:26,909 --> 00:54:28,375
Who? Miss Darrode.

691
00:54:28,475 --> 00:54:30,709
She's haunting this house.

692
00:54:30,809 --> 00:54:35,253
<i>No. No. That is such
superstitious drivel!</i>

693
00:54:35,254 --> 00:54:35,475
<i>No. No. That is such
superstitious drivel!</i>

694
00:54:35,575 --> 00:54:40,509
There's someone responsible for this,
and I know who it is-- Harris.

695
00:54:48,575 --> 00:54:50,275
Why Harris?

696
00:54:50,375 --> 00:54:52,775
Because that bastard
has somehow figured out...

697
00:54:52,875 --> 00:54:55,409
how to make his holographs
solid-- I know it!

698
00:54:55,509 --> 00:54:57,875
And he's always hated me,
so he's trying to kill me...

699
00:54:57,975 --> 00:54:59,975
so that he can steal
our research!

700
00:55:00,075 --> 00:55:02,795
How is that even possible? I mean,
aren't holographs made of nothing?

701
00:55:02,875 --> 00:55:05,253
Huh? Dense photons. Coherent light waves.
How the hell do I know?

702
00:55:05,254 --> 00:55:07,375
Huh? Dense photons. Coherent light waves.
How the hell do I know?

703
00:55:07,475 --> 00:55:09,709
He's the genius. Take that.

704
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,042
Harris, you open this door!

705
00:55:14,142 --> 00:55:18,775
I know what you're trying to do, you
miscreant, maladjusted, misfit motherfucker!

706
00:55:18,875 --> 00:55:21,775
Why won't anyone listen to me? It
is the spirit of Miss Darrode.

707
00:55:21,875 --> 00:55:24,609
I-I don't know who sounds
crazier, Walston or you.

708
00:55:28,742 --> 00:55:31,675
Okay, who goes first?
Okay. Be my guest, baby.

709
00:55:31,775 --> 00:55:35,009
Oh, my God! Are you okay?
You okay?

710
00:55:35,109 --> 00:55:35,254
Oh, you poor baby. What?

711
00:55:35,255 --> 00:55:38,342
Oh, you poor baby. What?

712
00:55:45,142 --> 00:55:46,909
Oh, my God.

713
00:55:51,175 --> 00:55:53,075
Open up! Please!

714
00:56:03,075 --> 00:56:04,842
It's a security door.

715
00:56:04,942 --> 00:56:05,254
Walston, you need a battering
ram to open it. Oh, shut up.

716
00:56:05,255 --> 00:56:07,709
Walston, you need a battering
ram to open it. Oh, shut up.

717
00:56:07,809 --> 00:56:10,742
Look, isn't there a way to shut
down the holograph system? Yes.

718
00:56:10,842 --> 00:56:13,309
The fuse box,
which is in the basement!

719
00:56:14,175 --> 00:56:15,909
Wa-Wa-Wa-Wait a minute.

720
00:56:16,009 --> 00:56:19,909
We installed a backup fuse box
to handle power overloads.

721
00:56:20,009 --> 00:56:21,342
Where is it? Second floor.

722
00:56:21,442 --> 00:56:23,842
- Let's go.
- How did I know you were gonna say that?

723
00:56:23,942 --> 00:56:26,382
Did you really think we're being
attacked by a woman's spirit?

724
00:56:26,409 --> 00:56:29,775
Yes! And I think it's because of me.
I'm sorry.

725
00:56:29,875 --> 00:56:34,342
<i>Why? What would the ghost of
some murderer have against you?</i>

726
00:56:34,442 --> 00:56:35,253
I lied when I said I hadn't
heard of this place before.

727
00:56:35,254 --> 00:56:37,675
I lied when I said I hadn't
heard of this place before.

728
00:56:38,775 --> 00:56:41,109
I was here 14 years ago,
the day of the massacre.

729
00:56:41,209 --> 00:56:42,709
What?

730
00:56:44,175 --> 00:56:46,975
I was here.
I was seven years old.

731
00:56:47,075 --> 00:56:52,109
But I can't remember anything.
Just images and flashes.

732
00:56:52,209 --> 00:56:54,809
I can't remember
what happened to me!

733
00:56:54,909 --> 00:57:00,342
And my psychiatrist said that if I came
back here, my memories would return.

734
00:57:02,042 --> 00:57:05,009
So that's why you talked us
all into taking this job?

735
00:57:05,109 --> 00:57:05,254
I was scared. I was scared.

736
00:57:05,255 --> 00:57:07,209
I was scared. I was scared.

737
00:57:07,309 --> 00:57:11,609
And I thought that with everybody
working here, I'd be able to handle it.

738
00:57:15,042 --> 00:57:17,642
You fucking bitch.

739
00:57:17,742 --> 00:57:20,275
I trusted you.

740
00:57:20,375 --> 00:57:22,475
You-- You fucking
got people killed...

741
00:57:22,575 --> 00:57:24,309
<i>being pawns in
your fucking therapy?</i>

742
00:57:24,409 --> 00:57:26,609
You fucking bitch!

743
00:57:26,709 --> 00:57:28,975
Calm down, Lily!

744
00:57:29,075 --> 00:57:31,955
Look, how could Claire know this was
gonna happen? How could anyone know?

745
00:57:31,975 --> 00:57:34,409
Look, this is all so ridiculous!

746
00:57:34,509 --> 00:57:35,253
Harris is behind this,
all right?

747
00:57:35,254 --> 00:57:36,975
Harris is behind this,
all right?

748
00:57:37,075 --> 00:57:40,342
Now, if you're done with the soap opera
interlude, get on with this! Come on!

749
00:57:40,442 --> 00:57:43,009
He's right. All right, we don't
have time to fight, you know,

750
00:57:43,109 --> 00:57:44,809
whether it's with Harris
or some spirit.

751
00:57:44,909 --> 00:57:48,709
They're using the system to kill us.
We gotta shut it down.

752
00:58:17,109 --> 00:58:21,075
Okay, so there's a gray metal panel
behind that painting on the far wall.

753
00:58:21,175 --> 00:58:22,875
Past all the rooms--
Awesome.

754
00:58:22,975 --> 00:58:26,342
So one of us has to got to go down there
and unscrew the panel with this...

755
00:58:26,442 --> 00:58:28,342
and disconnect the red wires.

756
00:58:28,442 --> 00:58:30,342
- So, volunteers?
- I'll do it.

757
00:58:30,442 --> 00:58:32,342
No. Excellent idea.

758
00:58:32,442 --> 00:58:34,475
This is up to me.
All right, look.

759
00:58:34,575 --> 00:58:35,253
Red wires, you got that?
All right.

760
00:58:35,254 --> 00:58:36,574
Red wires, you got that?
All right.

761
00:58:36,575 --> 00:58:39,542
Whatever you do, remain calm.

762
00:58:39,642 --> 00:58:44,342
Holographs are triggered by fear.
Calm. Red wires. Good man.

763
00:58:44,442 --> 00:58:47,409
Be careful, Rudy.

764
00:58:49,675 --> 00:58:52,975
Ohh. No, no, no, no.
Remain calm.

765
00:58:55,109 --> 00:58:57,509
<i>All right, all right.
Good, good, good.</i>

766
00:58:59,709 --> 00:59:02,009
You can do it.

767
00:59:02,109 --> 00:59:04,009
Hurry! Good man.

768
00:59:04,109 --> 00:59:05,253
- Shit. - Come on!
- You're almost there.

769
00:59:05,254 --> 00:59:06,854
- Shit. - Come on!
- You're almost there.

770
00:59:12,242 --> 00:59:15,775
- Oh, my God!
- Oh, fuck! He's coming after you! Rudy, look--

771
00:59:15,875 --> 00:59:18,375
- Hurry!
- No! Don't turn around! Just keep doing it!

772
00:59:18,475 --> 00:59:21,542
- Oh, my God! Hurry! Hurry, Rudy!
<i>- Rudy!</i>

773
00:59:21,642 --> 00:59:24,042
- Rudy! - Hurry!
<i>- Rudy, look out!</i>

774
00:59:24,142 --> 00:59:26,242
Rudy! Oh, my God!

775
00:59:26,342 --> 00:59:28,675
<i>The last one! Rudy!</i>

776
00:59:28,775 --> 00:59:31,642
- Hurry, Rudy!
- Oh, God! Rudy! Hurry!

777
00:59:31,742 --> 00:59:34,375
<i>He's coming! Don't look!</i>

778
00:59:34,475 --> 00:59:35,253
Hurry! Hurry! Go! Go! Look out!

779
00:59:35,254 --> 00:59:37,042
Hurry! Hurry! Go! Go! Look out!

780
00:59:37,142 --> 00:59:39,475
I got it!

781
00:59:39,575 --> 00:59:41,209
Hurry! Oh, my God!

782
00:59:41,309 --> 00:59:43,842
<i>Go!</i>

783
00:59:55,942 --> 00:59:59,342
Oh, my God! Rudy! Oh, my God!

784
00:59:59,442 --> 01:00:01,709
Oh, my God.

785
01:00:01,809 --> 01:00:04,109
Go and help Rudy.

786
01:00:04,209 --> 01:00:05,253
He's dead, Claire.
All right, he's dead.

787
01:00:05,254 --> 01:00:06,814
He's dead, Claire.
All right, he's dead.

788
01:00:09,142 --> 01:00:11,542
It's a good thing
we're all smokers.

789
01:00:11,642 --> 01:00:15,742
Hey, wait a minute.
What is this?

790
01:00:15,842 --> 01:00:18,502
Oh, I don't believe it.

791
01:00:18,602 --> 01:00:21,302
These are the basement
door keys in my pocket.

792
01:00:21,402 --> 01:00:23,369
What now, Walston?
What do you mean, "what now?"

793
01:00:23,469 --> 01:00:25,369
I'm going back to the
basement to get Harris.

794
01:00:25,469 --> 01:00:27,369
And we can probably unlock
the doors from there.

795
01:00:27,469 --> 01:00:29,569
<i>- Come on.
- Wait a minute.</i>

796
01:00:29,669 --> 01:00:31,802
Didn't you say there was
an open window in the attic?

797
01:00:31,902 --> 01:00:33,802
- Yes.
- Well, how do you get there?

798
01:00:33,902 --> 01:00:35,253
There's an access door inside that
storage closet right there. Why?

799
01:00:35,254 --> 01:00:36,269
There's an access door inside that
storage closet right there. Why?

800
01:00:36,369 --> 01:00:39,102
That's where I'm going.
You can do what you want.

801
01:00:41,469 --> 01:00:45,035
You go ahead. I don't care.
I know where I'm going.

802
01:00:45,135 --> 01:00:48,102
Claire, are you with me
or with her?

803
01:00:48,202 --> 01:00:50,335
<i>I'd go with him, Claire.</i>

804
01:00:50,435 --> 01:00:52,569
You're not safe alone with me.

805
01:00:54,335 --> 01:00:57,535
- Let's go.
- Fine.

806
01:00:59,002 --> 01:01:01,769
<i>Hey, Claire? Yeah?</i>

807
01:01:01,869 --> 01:01:04,035
You got your closure now?

808
01:01:25,235 --> 01:01:27,235
Fuck.

809
01:01:41,502 --> 01:01:43,535
Okay.

810
01:01:43,635 --> 01:01:45,602
Oh, shit! Shit!

811
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:48,969
You know, there's an emergency generator
in the garage. That fucker, Harris.

812
01:01:49,069 --> 01:01:53,235
It's not Harris! Let's go.

813
01:01:57,635 --> 01:02:00,635
War is hell.

814
01:02:02,869 --> 01:02:05,253
Jesus! Ah, here we go.

815
01:02:05,254 --> 01:02:06,835
Jesus! Ah, here we go.

816
01:02:06,935 --> 01:02:09,002
Oh, damn it! Damn it!

817
01:02:12,802 --> 01:02:15,202
No!

818
01:02:15,302 --> 01:02:18,069
No! Claire!

819
01:02:18,169 --> 01:02:19,735
Claire!

820
01:02:19,835 --> 01:02:21,702
No! No!

821
01:02:24,869 --> 01:02:30,469
No! No! Aah!

822
01:02:46,269 --> 01:02:49,102
No!

823
01:03:16,002 --> 01:03:19,502
Walston.

824
01:03:19,602 --> 01:03:21,602
Oh, my God.

825
01:03:35,102 --> 01:03:36,573
<i>Don't let him close it! Please!</i>

826
01:03:36,574 --> 01:03:39,835
<i>Don't let him close it! Please!</i>

827
01:03:39,935 --> 01:03:41,935
Stop it! Somebody's coming!

828
01:03:56,935 --> 01:04:00,602
<i>Let me out of here!</i>

829
01:04:59,169 --> 01:05:02,669
<i>"And some trumpet players." Ow.</i>

830
01:05:04,602 --> 01:05:06,573
"And I saw an angel
come down from heaven,

831
01:05:06,574 --> 01:05:08,069
"And I saw an angel
come down from heaven,

832
01:05:08,169 --> 01:05:11,302
"holding the key
to the bottomless pit...

833
01:05:11,402 --> 01:05:14,969
and a great chain
in his hands." Ow!

834
01:05:15,069 --> 01:05:18,569
Ow! Ohh!
Hear the words of God...

835
01:05:18,669 --> 01:05:22,302
and leave this child,
foul demon Azazel.

836
01:05:22,402 --> 01:05:25,769
"...the dragon,
that old s-serpent,

837
01:05:25,869 --> 01:05:27,869
"which is the devil and Satan,

838
01:05:27,969 --> 01:05:29,835
and bound him a thousand years."

839
01:05:32,802 --> 01:05:36,573
And I do unbind you from
this child, demon Lamia.

840
01:05:36,574 --> 01:05:37,102
And I do unbind you from
this child, demon Lamia.

841
01:05:37,202 --> 01:05:39,369
"He cast him into
this bottomless pit.

842
01:05:39,469 --> 01:05:45,535
He shut him up and set a seal upon
him, as to deceive nations no more."

843
01:05:47,435 --> 01:05:51,902
I exorcise you into the
bottomless pit, demon Mammon,

844
01:05:52,002 --> 01:05:54,069
subverter of the pure
and innocent.

845
01:05:54,169 --> 01:05:57,002
Be gone, hellions!

846
01:06:08,135 --> 01:06:11,702
Now it's just the two of us,

847
01:06:11,802 --> 01:06:16,935
you most evil of all demons.

848
01:06:28,169 --> 01:06:32,669
I've come for you,
cursed Juvaar.

849
01:06:35,569 --> 01:06:36,573
If you came for me, why did
you kill all the others?

850
01:06:36,574 --> 01:06:39,835
If you came for me, why did
you kill all the others?

851
01:06:39,935 --> 01:06:44,302
The deaths of those sinners--

852
01:06:44,402 --> 01:06:48,969
Brought me back to the flesh.

853
01:06:49,069 --> 01:06:52,569
Why are you still here?

854
01:06:52,669 --> 01:06:56,569
<i>I was damned...</i>

855
01:06:56,669 --> 01:06:59,735
because I let you get away.

856
01:07:01,102 --> 01:07:04,235
But I'll soon be free!

857
01:07:04,335 --> 01:07:06,573
Because now I'm sending you
back where you belong,

858
01:07:06,574 --> 01:07:09,369
Because now I'm sending you
back where you belong,

859
01:07:09,469 --> 01:07:12,302
demon!

860
01:07:12,402 --> 01:07:15,569
Why do you think I'm a demon?
What did I do?

861
01:07:15,669 --> 01:07:17,735
Oh.

862
01:07:23,502 --> 01:07:28,069
You'll have plenty of time
to remember it all...

863
01:07:28,169 --> 01:07:31,502
while you rot in hell!

864
01:07:38,069 --> 01:07:40,335
No!

865
01:08:38,402 --> 01:08:40,435
No more!

866
01:08:46,235 --> 01:08:51,535
What's wrong?
What are you doing?

867
01:08:54,969 --> 01:08:57,969
No more.

868
01:09:40,302 --> 01:09:42,135
No!

869
01:09:42,235 --> 01:09:45,235
You fucking demons!

870
01:09:45,335 --> 01:09:48,435
You stay right where you are!

871
01:09:51,802 --> 01:09:53,702
Help! Help!

872
01:09:56,635 --> 01:09:59,235
Die! Die!

873
01:10:03,169 --> 01:10:06,069
<i>The house of the-- No!</i>

874
01:10:06,169 --> 01:10:06,574
<i>No!</i>

875
01:10:06,575 --> 01:10:08,302
<i>No!</i>

876
01:10:08,402 --> 01:10:10,935
<i>Die, you demons!</i>

877
01:10:11,035 --> 01:10:15,502
<i>You filthy demons,
may you rot in hell!</i>

878
01:10:15,602 --> 01:10:19,202
<i>No! No! Please!</i>

879
01:10:19,302 --> 01:10:22,635
<i>Die!</i>

880
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:29,235
<i>- No! No!
- Die! Die!</i>

881
01:11:24,602 --> 01:11:26,602
Claire?

882
01:11:28,169 --> 01:11:31,035
I know you're here somewhere.

883
01:11:32,502 --> 01:11:34,535
<i>Claire?</i>

884
01:11:41,102 --> 01:11:46,102
You're possessed
by the demon named Juvaar.

885
01:11:46,202 --> 01:11:49,569
I need to save your soul.

886
01:11:50,402 --> 01:11:55,602
Claire, do you hear me? Claire?

887
01:11:57,635 --> 01:11:59,702
<i>Claire?</i>

888
01:12:06,535 --> 01:12:06,574
It's all your fault!

889
01:12:06,575 --> 01:12:09,669
It's all your fault!

890
01:12:09,769 --> 01:12:11,969
Claire!

891
01:12:13,269 --> 01:12:17,069
Why did you make this happen?

892
01:12:22,835 --> 01:12:26,102
Oh, God!

893
01:12:28,469 --> 01:12:30,502
I--

894
01:12:32,035 --> 01:12:34,535
Oh, God. Oh, God.

895
01:12:34,635 --> 01:12:36,573
Oh, God, forgive me, please.
Oh, God, please.

896
01:12:36,574 --> 01:12:38,635
Oh, God, forgive me, please.
Oh, God, please.

897
01:12:38,735 --> 01:12:41,502
Oh, God!

898
01:12:44,369 --> 01:12:46,869
What did I do?

899
01:12:46,969 --> 01:12:49,835
What have I done?

900
01:13:56,502 --> 01:13:59,802
It wasn't my fault.

901
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:02,302
<i>I was a child.</i>

902
01:14:02,402 --> 01:14:06,402
We were all children
who didn't know any better.

903
01:14:14,169 --> 01:14:18,435
We were never the sinners!
You were.

904
01:14:18,535 --> 01:14:21,769
You took a religion that was about
love and you made us hate it!

905
01:14:25,569 --> 01:14:29,802
I have been running from you
my whole life!

906
01:14:29,902 --> 01:14:31,802
I am through running!

907
01:14:37,269 --> 01:14:40,235
Miss Darrode,
you go to hell, bitch!

908
01:14:52,002 --> 01:14:55,202
Go to hell, bitch.

909
01:14:55,302 --> 01:14:58,069
Miss Darrode, go to hell!

910
01:14:58,169 --> 01:15:01,035
Go to hell, bitch.

911
01:15:01,135 --> 01:15:03,569
Go to hell, bitch.

912
01:15:03,669 --> 01:15:06,535
Go! Go!

913
01:15:06,635 --> 01:15:08,935
Go to hell, bitch.

914
01:15:09,035 --> 01:15:13,302
Bitch, go to hell.

915
01:15:13,402 --> 01:15:15,335
Go to hell.

916
01:15:15,435 --> 01:15:18,169
Go to hell.

917
01:15:19,402 --> 01:15:23,035
Go to hell. Hey, Detective, in here!
We found one alive!

918
01:15:28,935 --> 01:15:31,435
Go to hell, bitch.

919
01:15:31,535 --> 01:15:34,369
Go to hell, bitch.

920
01:15:34,469 --> 01:15:36,435
Go to hell.

921
01:15:41,335 --> 01:15:43,802
Kill. Kill.

922
01:15:43,902 --> 01:15:46,269
Kill.

923
01:15:46,369 --> 01:15:48,635
Kill.

924
01:15:50,802 --> 01:15:54,202
Kill. Kill.

925
01:16:01,202 --> 01:16:04,135
<i>Hey. Hey.</i>

926
01:16:04,235 --> 01:16:06,902
Need some help analyzing
all this evidence?

927
01:16:07,002 --> 01:16:10,069
No. I got it all figured out.

928
01:16:10,169 --> 01:16:12,369
I'll write up my report
and we can close the case.

929
01:16:12,469 --> 01:16:15,735
All right, Sherlock,

930
01:16:15,835 --> 01:16:18,102
<i>dazzle me, won't you?</i>

931
01:16:18,202 --> 01:16:19,025
Janet Darrode inherited
this old house 17 years ago.

932
01:16:19,026 --> 01:16:20,769
Janet Darrode inherited
this old house 17 years ago.

933
01:16:20,869 --> 01:16:25,302
She started bringing in income
by taking in foster children.

934
01:16:25,402 --> 01:16:28,969
She goes cuckoo one day
and kills seven of 'em.

935
01:16:29,069 --> 01:16:30,969
Darrode House massacre.

936
01:16:31,069 --> 01:16:33,702
So here's where
it gets real interesting.

937
01:16:33,802 --> 01:16:35,835
Only one kid lives--

938
01:16:35,935 --> 01:16:38,102
A little girl by the name
of Claire.

939
01:16:38,202 --> 01:16:42,269
Bingo. Claire's identity
is kept secret.

940
01:16:42,369 --> 01:16:44,269
She's adopted by a local couple.

941
01:16:44,369 --> 01:16:46,335
But the girl's traumatized.

942
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:48,702
She develops more bugs
than Windows Vista.

943
01:16:48,802 --> 01:16:49,026
I mean, a cutter, suicide
tries, psych meds up the wazoo.

944
01:16:49,027 --> 01:16:52,769
I mean, a cutter, suicide
tries, psych meds up the wazoo.

945
01:16:52,869 --> 01:16:57,235
Her idiot shrink tells her to go
back to recover her memories.

946
01:16:57,335 --> 01:17:01,669
<i>Claire takes this haunted house gig, but
it's way too much for her mind to handle.</i>

947
01:17:01,769 --> 01:17:05,969
Plus, she's off her meds.
A lethal combination.

948
01:17:06,069 --> 01:17:08,035
Claire goes psycho.

949
01:17:08,135 --> 01:17:10,335
She takes out the guy
controlling the holographs...

950
01:17:10,435 --> 01:17:12,969
and sets the computer
on overdrive.

951
01:17:13,069 --> 01:17:15,802
She puts glue
into the door locks.

952
01:17:15,902 --> 01:17:19,025
Now these holographs start to run crazy.
Confusion erupts all over.

953
01:17:19,026 --> 01:17:20,102
Now these holographs start to run crazy.
Confusion erupts all over.

954
01:17:20,202 --> 01:17:22,202
And in the midst
of all this chaos,

955
01:17:22,302 --> 01:17:27,102
our little Claire takes everybody
out one by two by three.

956
01:17:27,202 --> 01:17:30,802
We found her fingerprints
on all of the murder weapons.

957
01:17:30,902 --> 01:17:34,069
And Claire keeps mumbling that
Miss Darrode killed everyone.

958
01:17:34,169 --> 01:17:38,069
That's how it happened--
In her head.

959
01:17:38,169 --> 01:17:40,669
Still hard to believe that...

960
01:17:40,769 --> 01:17:45,702
one little girl took out all
these people all by herself.

961
01:17:45,802 --> 01:17:48,235
The facts don't lie, buddy.

962
01:17:49,169 --> 01:17:51,969
They never lie.

963
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:56,035
We'll see.

964
01:18:03,135 --> 01:18:07,235
Babe, it's either now or never.

965
01:18:07,335 --> 01:18:09,602
You ready?

966
01:18:09,702 --> 01:18:11,669
Okay, I'm ready.

967
01:18:27,802 --> 01:18:31,669
So... this is it.

968
01:18:33,569 --> 01:18:36,535
Does it look the same
as you remember it?

969
01:18:36,635 --> 01:18:39,102
Pretty much.

970
01:18:39,202 --> 01:18:42,669
I found the first body there.

971
01:18:42,769 --> 01:18:45,269
Then another one on the stairs.

972
01:18:47,302 --> 01:18:49,025
You said there were more
of them in here, right?

973
01:18:49,026 --> 01:18:49,802
You said there were more
of them in here, right?

974
01:18:49,902 --> 01:18:52,202
Yeah. Four more.

975
01:18:54,402 --> 01:18:56,135
It's so weird.

976
01:18:56,235 --> 01:18:57,935
After the police found me
on the floor,

977
01:18:58,035 --> 01:19:02,535
my family moved out of town so fast
that I never saw this house again,

978
01:19:02,635 --> 01:19:07,102
but I remember everything
like it was yesterday.

979
01:19:11,169 --> 01:19:14,335
Not everybody discovers
a massacre.

980
01:19:16,135 --> 01:19:19,025
So, was the therapist right?

981
01:19:19,026 --> 01:19:19,469
So, was the therapist right?

982
01:19:19,569 --> 01:19:22,802
Do you feel better
now that you've seen it?

983
01:19:22,902 --> 01:19:25,502
Yeah, I do.

984
01:19:26,969 --> 01:19:29,035
Thanks for driving me
up here, babe.

985
01:19:29,135 --> 01:19:33,002
That's what us boyfriends
are for.

986
01:19:34,702 --> 01:19:38,469
Oh, I've had nightmares about
this place my whole life.

987
01:19:38,569 --> 01:19:44,535
But now that I'm here,
I can see it's just a house.

988
01:19:44,635 --> 01:19:46,735
That's all it is.

989
01:19:54,102 --> 01:19:57,369
What's happening?

990
01:20:04,835 --> 01:20:06,935
I didn't--

991
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:08,935
I-I didn't do it.

992
01:20:09,035 --> 01:20:12,269
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

993
01:20:12,369 --> 01:20:15,169
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

994
01:20:15,269 --> 01:20:18,735
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

995
01:20:18,835 --> 01:20:19,026
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

996
01:20:19,027 --> 01:20:22,202
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

997
01:20:22,302 --> 01:20:26,135
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

998
01:20:26,235 --> 01:20:29,935
I didn't do it. I didn't do it.

999
01:20:30,035 --> 01:20:33,369
She's still out there!
