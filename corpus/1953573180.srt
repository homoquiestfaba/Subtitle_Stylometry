- [laughs]

6
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,202
- HEY!
[speaking Spanish]

7
00:01:10,204 --> 00:01:14,206
- SHH! SHH! NO, NO.
JUST BE QUIET.

8
00:01:14,208 --> 00:01:15,307
SHIT.

9
00:01:15,309 --> 00:01:18,577
SHIT. SHIT. SHIT.

10
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:20,279
- HEY!
HEY!

11
00:01:20,281 --> 00:01:21,780
GET THE FUCK BACK HERE!

12
00:01:21,782 --> 00:01:24,116
HEY, GIVE ME
THAT FUCKING CAMERA!

13
00:01:24,118 --> 00:01:26,452
[indistinct shouts]

14
00:01:36,563 --> 00:01:38,263
- YEAH, SO YOU'RE WATCHING
THAT FOOTAGE I SENT?

15
00:01:38,265 --> 00:01:40,099
- YEAH, I'M LOOKING, SON,
AND YOU--

16
00:01:40,101 --> 00:01:42,468
- SO AS YOU PROBABLY GUESSED,
YOUR WIFE HIRED ME TO GET THAT.

17
00:01:42,470 --> 00:01:45,137
THE PROBLEM IS IF I SHOW IT
TO HER, SHE STOPS PAYING ME.

18
00:01:45,139 --> 00:01:47,506
SO I WAS THINKING YOU MIGHT WANT
TO MAKE A COUNTER-OFFER THERE.

19
00:01:47,508 --> 00:01:49,541
OH, AND WHATEVER NUMBER
YOU COME UP WITH,

20
00:01:49,543 --> 00:01:53,312
YOU CAN PUT 300 BUCKS ON TOP
FOR THE DENT YOU PUT IN MY CAR.

21
00:01:53,314 --> 00:01:55,681
WELL, YOU SCRATCHED THE PAINT
ANYWAY.

22
00:01:55,683 --> 00:01:57,649
YOU KNOW WHAT, IF I DON'T HEAR
FROM YOU BY TOMORROW,

23
00:01:57,651 --> 00:01:59,585
YOUR WIFE GETS THAT FILE.
GOOD-BYE.

24
00:01:59,587 --> 00:02:02,521
[phone beeps off]
- SO WHAT'S THE DEAL NOW?

25
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:04,523
- AH, PROBABLY NOTHING.
JUST THIS WOMAN THINKS

26
00:02:04,525 --> 00:02:07,326
HER SON IS MISSING.

27
00:02:07,328 --> 00:02:08,393
HE HASN'T BEEN TO CLASS
IN A WEEK.

28
00:02:08,395 --> 00:02:10,229
HE WON'T ANSWER HER CALLS.

29
00:02:10,231 --> 00:02:12,764
HE'S PROBABLY PASSED OUT
IN A PILE OF BEER CANS.

30
00:02:12,766 --> 00:02:15,167
IN WHICH CASE WE'RE GONNA
TAKE THE KID ON A ROAD TRIP

31
00:02:15,169 --> 00:02:16,635
AND RACK UP SOME EXPENSES,
'CAUSE WE'RE GETTING

32
00:02:16,637 --> 00:02:18,203
1,000 BUCKS A DAY
ON THIS ONE.

33
00:02:18,205 --> 00:02:21,607
TURN LEFT UP HERE.

34
00:02:21,609 --> 00:02:23,675
- YOUR BUTTON CAM'S WORKING?

35
00:02:23,677 --> 00:02:26,512
- YEAH, IT'S WORKING.

36
00:02:30,517 --> 00:02:31,850
- THIS IS IT?

37
00:02:31,852 --> 00:02:34,820
- YEAH.

38
00:02:34,822 --> 00:02:37,689
- IT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE
ANYONE'S HOME.

39
00:02:37,691 --> 00:02:39,525
SHE COULDN'T GIVE YOU A KEY?

40
00:02:39,527 --> 00:02:41,793
- SHE DOESN'T HAVE ONE.
SHE SAID THE LOCK

41
00:02:41,795 --> 00:02:43,328
ON THE BACK WINDOW'S BUSTED,

42
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:44,630
SO MAYBE WE CAN GET IN
THAT WAY.

43
00:02:44,632 --> 00:02:46,498
- AND THE COPS HAVEN'T
BEEN HERE?

44
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:48,567
- NO, THE COPS DON'T GIVE A SHIT
ABOUT SOME COLLEGE KID

45
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:49,935
WHO'S MISSING
FOR A COUPLE DAYS.

46
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:52,471
[dog barking in distance]

47
00:02:52,473 --> 00:02:54,540
HERE.

48
00:03:01,514 --> 00:03:04,683
[sharp bang inside]
- IS THERE SOMEONE IN THERE?

49
00:03:04,685 --> 00:03:07,886
- HERE.
COME ON, GIVE ME THE CAM.

50
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:18,897
THERE'S NOTHING THERE.

51
00:03:18,899 --> 00:03:21,667
- IT SURE AS FUCK SOUNDED
LIKE THERE'S SOMETHING THERE.

52
00:03:21,669 --> 00:03:23,535
- IT'S AN OLD HOUSE.

53
00:03:23,537 --> 00:03:24,970
BESIDES, IF THERE IS SOMEBODY
IN THERE,

54
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:28,707
I'M GONNA WANT TO TALK TO 'EM.

55
00:03:28,709 --> 00:03:30,909
HERE.

56
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,565
YOU ALL RIGHT?

57
00:03:53,567 --> 00:03:55,968
- JUST GREAT. OW.

58
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,237
- YOU OKAY?

59
00:04:08,848 --> 00:04:11,917
[static white noise]

60
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,289
- HUH.

61
00:04:49,055 --> 00:04:52,758
- UM...
- WHAT?

62
00:04:52,760 --> 00:04:54,426
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
STAY IN HERE, OKAY?

63
00:04:54,428 --> 00:04:56,528
I'M GONNA GO CHECK
THE REST OF THIS APARTMENT

64
00:04:56,530 --> 00:04:58,563
AND MAKE SURE NO ONE ELSE IS
IN HERE, OKAY?

65
00:04:58,565 --> 00:05:00,832
YOU GOT YOUR GUN?
- YEAH.

66
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:03,502
- ALL RIGHT, GOOD.
JUST--JUST, UM,

67
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:05,871
PULL ANYTHING RELEVANT
ONTO THAT DRIVE. OKAY?

68
00:05:05,873 --> 00:05:07,639
AND RECORD EVERYTHING.

69
00:05:07,641 --> 00:05:09,074
THAT WAS PART OF THE DEAL.
SHE LIKES ME TO DO THAT.

70
00:05:09,076 --> 00:05:10,909
- WELL, YOU TOOK MY CAMERA.

71
00:05:10,911 --> 00:05:15,414
- OH. THEN...

72
00:05:15,416 --> 00:05:17,316
ALL RIGHT,
SO I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

73
00:05:17,318 --> 00:05:18,984
JUST, UM--
JUST, I DON'T KNOW,

74
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:20,552
SEE WHAT'S ON THAT COMPUTER,
OKAY?

75
00:05:20,554 --> 00:05:21,853
IF IT'S ENCRYPTED,
WE CAN TAKE IT HOME.

76
00:05:21,855 --> 00:05:23,355
IF NOT,
JUST PULL WHAT YOU CAN.

77
00:05:23,357 --> 00:05:25,424
- GOT IT.

78
00:05:48,981 --> 00:05:53,452
- SHOW HER TITS!
[woman cries out]

79
00:06:06,866 --> 00:06:09,701
[door creaks]

80
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,518
- [sighs]
I FOUND A NEW ONE.

81
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,088
IT'S THIRD OR FOURTH GENERATION
FROM THE QUALITY.

82
00:06:30,090 --> 00:06:32,691
I GOT IT FROM SOME GUY DOWN
IN LITTLE ARMENIA

83
00:06:32,693 --> 00:06:35,026
WITH A PAWN SHOP.

84
00:06:35,028 --> 00:06:36,928
HE IS DEFINITELY NOT THE TYPE
OF GUY YOU USUALLY SEE

85
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,631
ON HERE TRADING WITH US,
BUT I THINK HE'S SOMEBODY

86
00:06:39,633 --> 00:06:41,700
WHO'S WORTH
CHECKING IN ON AGAIN.

87
00:06:56,482 --> 00:07:00,152
- OKAY.
THAT'S FUCKING WEIRD.

88
00:07:02,555 --> 00:07:04,790
- MOST OF HIS COLLECTION,
I WOULD SAY,

89
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,758
WAS SNUFF AND CP,
BUT HE HAD AT LEAST ONE

90
00:07:06,760 --> 00:07:08,727
THAT WAS THE REAL THING.

91
00:07:08,729 --> 00:07:10,429
I DON'T EVEN THINK
HE KNEW WHAT IT WAS.

92
00:07:10,431 --> 00:07:12,831
ANYWAY--
[video paused]

93
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,061
[floor creaks]

94
00:08:01,547 --> 00:08:05,150

[electronic noise,
distorted voices]

97
00:08:27,073 --> 00:08:30,175
- A LITTLE BIT OF REDNESS,
SOME IRRITATION,

98
00:08:30,177 --> 00:08:32,644
BUT IT LOOKS OKAY.
HOW'S IT WORKING?

99
00:08:32,646 --> 00:08:35,146
- IT'S GOOD.
YEAH, I CAN SEE,

100
00:08:35,148 --> 00:08:36,581
BUT WHAT ABOUT
MY OTHER EYE?

101
00:08:36,583 --> 00:08:40,252
- FOLLOW.
- OKAY.

102
00:08:40,254 --> 00:08:42,787
- YOU CAN'T SEE ANYTHING
OUT OF YOUR BIOLOGICAL EYE?

103
00:08:42,789 --> 00:08:44,723
- NO.

104
00:08:44,725 --> 00:08:49,561
- OKAY.
HOW ABOUT NOW?

105
00:08:49,563 --> 00:08:51,263
- YEAH.
I MEAN, IT'S A LITTLE BETTER.

106
00:08:51,265 --> 00:08:53,698
IT'S JUST KIND OF BLURRY
AND SHADOWY.

107
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:56,801
- YEAH.
ALL RIGHT.

108
00:08:56,803 --> 00:08:58,837
WELL, BECAUSE YOUR PROSTHESIS
IS ATTACHED DIRECTLY

109
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,739
TO YOUR VISUAL CORTEX,

110
00:09:00,741 --> 00:09:03,241
YOU REAL EYE'S ESSENTIALLY
BATTLING WITH YOUR CAMERA EYE

111
00:09:03,243 --> 00:09:05,143
TO GIVE YOU INPUT RIGHT NOW.

112
00:09:05,145 --> 00:09:06,912
SO WHEN YOUR BRAIN GETS USED
TO HAVING THAT CHIP IN THERE,

113
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:08,246
YOU SHOULD START TO SEE
MORE AND MORE

114
00:09:08,248 --> 00:09:09,781
OUT OF YOUR UNINJURED EYE AGAIN.

115
00:09:09,783 --> 00:09:12,817
UNTIL THEN, YOU MIGHT SEE
SOME GLITCHES.

116
00:09:12,819 --> 00:09:14,753
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY GLITCHES?

117
00:09:14,755 --> 00:09:16,254
- WELL, THIS IS JUST BEING
TESTED NOW.

118
00:09:16,256 --> 00:09:19,758
EYE INJURIES LIKE YOURS
ARE QUITE RARE.

119
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:22,060
SO THAT'S WHY WE'VE INSTALLED
A RECORDING CHIP

120
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,896
INTO THE EYE ITSELF SO WE CAN
TEST THE DATA IT'S RECEIVING.

121
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:26,831
- RIGHT.
YEAH, ABOUT THAT.

122
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,167
- YES?
- OH, MY GOD.

123
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,203
SO IF I WANT PRIVATE TIME,
WHAT DO I DO?

124
00:09:32,205 --> 00:09:35,040
HOW DO I TURN THIS OFF?
- WELL, YOU CAN'T.

125
00:09:35,042 --> 00:09:36,908
BUT THAT'S JUST
FOR THIS TRIAL PERIOD.

126
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,644
YOU CAN'T EXPECT
THE KPG CORPORATION TO JUST

127
00:09:39,646 --> 00:09:43,615
GIVE YOU THIS IMPLANT
AND NOT EXPECT TO TEST ITS DATA.

128
00:09:43,617 --> 00:09:45,083
- OF COURSE NOT.

129
00:09:45,085 --> 00:09:47,218
SO YOU GUYS ARE GONNA SIT AROUND
AND WATCH ME TAKE SHITS?

130
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:50,722
- I'D SAY THAT'S A FAIR
COMPROMISE, MR. MIDDLETON.

131
00:09:50,724 --> 00:09:52,357
YOU CAN READ A NEWSPAPER DURING,
OR SOMETHING.

132
00:09:52,359 --> 00:09:53,925
- MM-HMM.

133
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:56,227
- SO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT
FOR NEXT WEEK.

134
00:09:56,229 --> 00:09:57,662
WE'LL SEE HOW IT'S WORKING.

135
00:09:57,664 --> 00:09:59,264
CALL ME IF YOU HAVE
ANY CONCERNS.

136
00:09:59,266 --> 00:10:00,799
- ALL RIGHT.
THANK YOU.

[voice drones over p.a.]

138
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:14,646

141
00:10:36,870 --> 00:10:38,069
ALL RIGHT, MAN.
- ALL RIGHT.

142
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:39,371
YOU SURE YOU GONNA
BE OKAY, BUD?

143
00:10:39,373 --> 00:10:40,905
- YEAH, DUDE, I'M GOOD.
I'M GOOD.

144
00:10:40,907 --> 00:10:42,207
- GIVE ME A SHOUT
IF YOU NEED ANYTHING.

145
00:10:42,209 --> 00:10:44,275
- SEE YA.

146
00:11:02,161 --> 00:11:04,129

ALL RIGHTY, THEN.

OKAY.

HELLO?

HELLO?
OH, COME ON.

OH, SHIT.

THE DIFFERENCE

00:13:27,474 --> 00:13:31,309
BETWEEN A BURST OF LIGHT AND
A FUCKING BLOODY PERSON, OKAY?

167
00:13:31,311 --> 00:13:34,979
I DON'T KNOW, YOU TELL ME.
YOU'RE THE DOCTOR.

168
00:13:34,981 --> 00:13:38,183
LOOK, I'M COMING IN THERE
TOMORROW, AND YOU'RE GONNA FIX

169

DON'T FUCK WITH ME.

176
00:14:29,336 --> 00:14:31,469
[whispers]
OH, GOD DAMN IT.

177
00:14:31,471 --> 00:14:34,873
HELLO?
[floor creaking]

178
00:14:38,344 --> 00:14:40,378
SHIT!

179
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,448
[panting]

180
00:14:43,450 --> 00:14:48,286
OH, FUCK.
[heavy bang]

181
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:51,022
WHAT THE FUCK?

182
00:15:01,667 --> 00:15:02,667
[heavy bang on door]

183
00:15:02,669 --> 00:15:05,036
[whimpers]

184
00:15:05,038 --> 00:15:06,271
HELLO?
[heavy bang]

185
00:15:06,273 --> 00:15:08,539
SHIT! UH, OKAY!

186
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:11,309
I'M GOOD.
THANK YOU, YOU CAN GO.

187
00:15:11,311 --> 00:15:13,678
[bang]
OH, SHIT!

188
00:15:13,680 --> 00:15:18,316
OH, FUCK!
[panicked breathing]

189
00:15:28,661 --> 00:15:32,063
OH, MY GOD.

190
00:15:50,382 --> 00:15:52,717
[whispers]
GOD DAMN IT.

191
00:16:13,005 --> 00:16:16,975
[relieved sighs]

192
00:16:30,322 --> 00:16:34,659
[doorbell chimes distortedly]

193
00:16:34,661 --> 00:16:37,328
OH, SHIT.

194
00:16:37,330 --> 00:16:41,599
[sighs]

195
00:16:41,601 --> 00:16:45,770
OH, SHIT.
[grunts]

196
00:16:59,251 --> 00:17:02,153
- HEY, ARE YOU IN THERE?

197
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:06,724
LOOK, I CAN SEE YOU
THROUGH THE PEEPHOLE.

198
00:17:06,726 --> 00:17:09,160
- WEREN'T YOU AT THE DOCTOR'S
OFFICE YESTERDAY?

199
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:11,362
- YEAH.

200
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:14,499
- OKAY, SO WHAT'S THE DEAL?
ARE YOU FOLLOWING ME?

201
00:17:14,501 --> 00:17:19,570
- I'M NOT FOLLOWING YOU.
LOOK, JUST OPEN THE DOOR.

202
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:22,306
- ALL RIGHT, LISTEN,
I DON'T MEAN TO BE RUDE,

203
00:17:22,308 --> 00:17:23,741
BUT IT'S KIND OF WEIRD,
YOU KNOW?

204
00:17:23,743 --> 00:17:25,743
- LOOK, ARE YOU SEEING
WEIRD STUFF?

205
00:17:25,745 --> 00:17:28,479
LIKE PEOPLE WHO LOOK DEAD?

206
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:31,749
YOU SHOULD REALLY
OPEN THE DOOR.

207
00:17:31,751 --> 00:17:33,818
- [sighs]

208
00:17:38,223 --> 00:17:40,691
- THANK YOU.
I'M CLARISSA.

209
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:43,628
- YEAH, COME ON IN.

210
00:17:43,630 --> 00:17:46,564
- NICE PLACE, MAN.
- THANKS.

211
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:48,366
- DO YOU HAVE ANY BEER?

212
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,401
- I DO. YES.

213
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,770
- WHAT ABOUT PAINKILLERS?
DID THE DOCTOR GIVE YOU ANY?

214
00:17:52,772 --> 00:17:55,306
- NO, I'M NOT ACTUALLY
IN ANY PAIN.

215
00:17:55,308 --> 00:17:57,308
- I'LL JUST TAKE A BEER THEN.

216
00:17:57,310 --> 00:18:00,545
- LOOK, CLARISSA, I'M ACTUALLY
ON MY WAY OUT OF HERE.

217
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,146
- DUDE, YOU'RE NOT GONNA
GET ANYWHERE

218
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:03,614
IF YOU DON'T HEAR
WHAT I HAVE TO SAY.

219
00:18:03,616 --> 00:18:06,317
JUST GIVE ME A BEER,
GET ONE FOR YOURSELF.

220
00:18:06,319 --> 00:18:09,387
YOU'RE GONNA NEED IT.

221
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:11,656
- RIGHT.

222
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:22,567
- THANKS.
- SURE.

223
00:18:22,569 --> 00:18:25,403
- I WAS BORN DEAF.

224
00:18:25,405 --> 00:18:27,438
WHEN I WAS 16,
MY PARENTS PUT ME UP

225
00:18:27,440 --> 00:18:30,241
FOR A NEW COCHLEAR IMPLANT.

226
00:18:30,243 --> 00:18:32,877
IT WORKED, OBVIOUSLY.

227
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:34,512
BUT I BEGAN TO BE ABLE
TO PICK UP

228
00:18:34,514 --> 00:18:38,182
CERTAIN FREQUENCIES
IN MY ENVIRONMENTS.

229
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:40,785
WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR EYE ANYWAY?

230
00:18:40,787 --> 00:18:46,190
- I WAS IN A, UM--
IN A CAR ACCIDENT.

231
00:18:46,192 --> 00:18:49,427
- SO WHO'S THE LITTLE GIRL?

232
00:18:49,429 --> 00:18:50,761
- WHAT LITTLE GIRL?

233
00:18:50,763 --> 00:18:52,563
- THERE'S A LITTLE GIRL HERE.

234
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:57,368
I HEARD HER CRYING
WHEN I CAME IN.

235
00:18:57,370 --> 00:18:59,637
BUT YOU KNOW...

236
00:18:59,639 --> 00:19:03,674
I DON'T HEAR HER NOW.

237
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:06,310
SOME PEOPLE NEVER HEAR THEM
OR SEE THEM.

238
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,312
MAYBE ONCE
IN THEIR ENTIRE LIVES,

239
00:19:08,314 --> 00:19:10,248
IF THEY'RE OPEN TO IT.

240
00:19:10,250 --> 00:19:15,620
SO WHEN YOU CAN SENSE THEM,
THEY KNOW.

241
00:19:15,622 --> 00:19:18,156
THEY CAN TELL.

242
00:19:18,158 --> 00:19:22,727
THAT'S WHY I WANTED TO FIND YOU.
TO WARN YOU.

243
00:19:22,729 --> 00:19:26,197
- WARN ME ABOUT WHAT?

244
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:28,366
- YEAH.

245
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:29,834
THE MORE YOU INTERACT
WITH THEM,

246
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:33,571
THE MORE THEY CAN TOUCH YOU,

247
00:19:33,573 --> 00:19:37,341
HURT YOU, STUFF.

248
00:19:37,343 --> 00:19:39,277
- WELL, TOMORROW I'M GONNA
GET THIS FUCKIN' THING

249
00:19:39,279 --> 00:19:41,512
TAKEN OUT OF MY HEAD,
AND THAT'LL BE THAT, RIGHT?

250
00:19:41,514 --> 00:19:43,247
- DON'T BE SO SURE.

251
00:19:43,249 --> 00:19:46,350
HAVE YOU EVER DONE ANYTHING BAD
TO ANYBODY?

252
00:19:46,352 --> 00:19:48,519
LOOK, IF YOU GET THE IMPLANT
TAKEN OUT,

253
00:19:48,521 --> 00:19:50,521
THEY'RE STILL GONNA
BE THERE.

254
00:19:50,523 --> 00:19:52,890
YOU'RE JUST NOT GONNA
BE ABLE TO SEE THEM.

255
00:19:52,892 --> 00:19:55,893
I DON'T KNOW,
MAYBE THAT'S BETTER.

256
00:19:55,895 --> 00:19:59,330
- WELL, I GUESS.
OH, SHIT!

257
00:19:59,332 --> 00:20:01,265
UM, I DON'T WANT TO ALARM YOU
RIGHT NOW,

258
00:20:01,267 --> 00:20:03,601
BUT THERE'S A FUCKING CREEPY
DUDE STANDING RIGHT BEHIND YOU.

259
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:06,270
- I KNOW.
I CAN HEAR HIM.

260
00:20:06,272 --> 00:20:09,607
- DO YOU KNOW HIM OR SOMETHING?
- HE WAS MY UNCLE.

261
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:12,243
- OH, OF COURSE, RIGHT.
I MEAN--

262
00:20:12,245 --> 00:20:14,979
WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN TO
CALL HIM CREEPY, BUT I MEAN--

263
00:20:14,981 --> 00:20:16,747
- HE WASN'T A NICE PERSON.

264
00:20:16,749 --> 00:20:20,685
- OKAY...
[techno dance music plays]

265
00:20:20,687 --> 00:20:23,287
- LISTEN, I KNOW HOW
TO MAKE HIM GO AWAY.

266
00:20:23,289 --> 00:20:24,922
JUST FOCUS ON ME.
- OKAY.

267
00:20:24,924 --> 00:20:26,924
OH!

268
00:20:26,926 --> 00:20:31,362
OH, SHIT.

269
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:35,499
- NO, DON'T LOOK AT HIM,
LOOK AT ME.

270
00:20:35,501 --> 00:20:43,241
¶

271
00:20:50,482 --> 00:20:53,684
- OH, SHIT.

272
00:21:12,838 --> 00:21:14,972
ALL RIGHT,
YOU SCIENTIST ASSHOLES,

273
00:21:14,974 --> 00:21:16,974
I WANT A COPY OF THAT FOOTAGE.

274
00:21:16,976 --> 00:21:18,809
LIKE, I WANT YOU TO PUT IT
ON A DISC OR SOMETHING,

275
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:20,978
BUT DON'T WATCH IT.

276
00:21:20,980 --> 00:21:24,815
JUST GET IT TO ME, OKAY?

277
00:21:24,817 --> 00:21:27,551
ALL RIGHT.

278
00:21:31,690 --> 00:21:34,992
OH, FUCK.

279
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:40,765
OH, GOD DAMN IT.

280
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:45,403
CLARISSA...
IS THAT YOU?

281
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:48,539
HEY.

282
00:21:48,541 --> 00:21:51,008
OH, SHIT!

283
00:21:57,049 --> 00:21:58,582
HEY.

284
00:21:58,584 --> 00:22:01,319
OH, GOD.

285
00:22:04,089 --> 00:22:06,924
OH, SHIT.

286

- [screaming]

287
00:22:15,401 --> 00:22:17,401
- WHAT THE FUCK?

[Clarissa screaming,
struggling]

00:22:20,907 --> 00:22:23,074
- [gasping]

290
00:22:23,076 --> 00:22:26,577
- CLARISSA,
GIVE ME YOUR HAND!

291
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:28,646
FUCK.

292
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,785
I GOT YOU.
I GOT YOU.

293
00:22:34,787 --> 00:22:38,356
[muted scream underwater]

294
00:23:06,785 --> 00:23:10,154

[distorted voices, moans]

297
00:23:42,053 --> 00:23:44,121
OH, FUCK!

00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:50,528
[cries out]

299
00:23:50,530 --> 00:23:52,930
[panting]

300
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,834
OH...OH...OH...OH...

301
00:24:03,675 --> 00:24:05,776
ALL RIGHT.

302
00:24:05,778 --> 00:24:09,747
YOU'RE COMING OUT OF HERE,
YOU FUCKER.

303
00:24:11,950 --> 00:24:15,085
EWW...OH, I CAN'T LOOK
AT THIS SHIT.

304
00:24:15,087 --> 00:24:18,689
OH, GOD.
[panting]

305
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:22,159
OKAY.

306
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:24,662
[pained grunts]

307
00:24:26,765 --> 00:24:29,099
[gasps]

OH, SHIT!
[screams]

310
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:26,023
- LARRY.
LARRY!

311
00:25:28,860 --> 00:25:31,228
- HEY, KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN.
WHAT?

312
00:25:31,230 --> 00:25:32,696
WHAT'S WRONG?
- NOTHING.

313
00:25:32,698 --> 00:25:34,899
I JUST WATCHED SOMETHING
REALLY WEIRD.

314
00:25:34,901 --> 00:25:37,768
IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN REAL,
SO--

315
00:25:37,770 --> 00:25:41,138
- OKAY. IS THERE ANYTHING
ON THAT COMPUTER?

316
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,773
- I'M CLONING
HIS HARD DRIVE NOW.

317
00:25:42,775 --> 00:25:44,241
IT SHOULDN'T TAKE TOO LONG.

318
00:25:44,243 --> 00:25:47,578
HERE, LOOK AT THIS.

319
00:25:47,580 --> 00:25:49,747
- TAPE IS THE FINAL LINK
FOR ME.

320
00:25:49,749 --> 00:25:53,918
I KNOW A LOT OF YOU HAVE POSTED
THAT IT ONLY AFFECTS YOU

321
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:55,853
IF YOU PLAY IT
IN A CORRECT SEQUENCE.

322
00:25:55,855 --> 00:25:59,723
BUT I'VE BEEN
EXPERIMENTING ON--

323
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:02,560
[volume off]
- IS THIS THE KID?

324
00:26:02,562 --> 00:26:04,562
- YEAH, THAT'S HIM.

325
00:26:04,564 --> 00:26:06,163
I FOUND SOME NOTEBOOKS
IN HIS ROOM.

326
00:26:06,165 --> 00:26:08,098
KIND OF LIKE JOURNALS.
MOSTLY JUST NONSENSE, THOUGH.

327
00:26:08,100 --> 00:26:12,069
I'M GOING THROUGH THEM
RIGHT NOW.

328
00:26:12,071 --> 00:26:13,971
WHY DON'T YOU, LIKE, KEEP
LOOKING AT THESE TAPES?

329
00:26:13,973 --> 00:26:16,206
KID'S A COLLECTOR.
I DON'T KNOW. WHO KNOWS?

330
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:18,008
MAYBE THERE'S SOMETHING RELEVANT
ON THEM.

331
00:26:18,010 --> 00:26:21,278
- OH. UM...
OKAY.

332
00:26:21,280 --> 00:26:23,180
- WE'RE ALL JUST
ELECTROMAGNETIC ENERGY,

333
00:26:23,182 --> 00:26:25,616
THEN THESE ANALOG TAPES
CAPTURING IMAGES

334
00:26:25,618 --> 00:26:26,984
OF THE SUPERNATURAL,

335
00:26:26,986 --> 00:26:29,286
THEY CAN AFFECT
OUR CEREBRAL CORTEX.

336
00:26:29,288 --> 00:26:33,223
THEY--THEY--
[video stopped, static droning]

337
00:27:07,859 --> 00:27:11,295
[cell phone chiming]

338
00:27:11,297 --> 00:27:12,896
- HEY, BABE.

339
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:14,732
- DON'T "HEY, BABE" ME,
MIKE SULLIVAN.

340
00:27:14,734 --> 00:27:16,133
WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE
HAVING BREAKFAST.

341
00:27:16,135 --> 00:27:18,102
- YEAH, BUT IT'S
A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

342
00:27:18,104 --> 00:27:19,937
I JUST WANT TO TAKE THE BIKE OUT
FOR A SPIN.

343
00:27:19,939 --> 00:27:22,206
- I WANTED YOU TO TAKE ME
FOR A SPIN.

344
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:25,142
YOU KNOW, YOU RIDE THAT BIKE
MORE THAN YOU RIDE ME.

345
00:27:25,144 --> 00:27:28,979
- YEAH, BUT YOU KNOW THE BIKE
IS JUST A PHYSICAL THING, BABE.

346
00:27:28,981 --> 00:27:31,181
- [chuckles]
MM-HMM.

347
00:27:31,183 --> 00:27:34,284
NOW, TELL ME YOU LOVE ME.

348
00:27:34,286 --> 00:27:36,353
- I LOVE YOU.

349
00:27:36,355 --> 00:27:39,256
