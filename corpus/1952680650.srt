00:26:28,560 --> 00:26:32,620
... Couple with their baby, who was returning from a family reunion ...

179
00:26:33,610 --> 00:26:35,932
his wife was sleeping in the front seat ...

180
00:26:36,490 --> 00:26:39,500
... The child was doing the same in the back seat, a few hours before.

181
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:42,110
The husband was driving.

182
00:26:42,145 --> 00:26:43,900
Suddenly ...

183
00:26:44,050 --> 00:26:47,750
The man thinks he sees something ...

184
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:50,580
- She was good?
I don't know" responded Ligio, who then went on.

185
00:26:51,350 --> 00:26:55,350
Looking better in the night, was able to see what ...

186
00:26:55,385 --> 00:27:00,580
a naked girl walking on the roadside.

187
00:27:03,790 --> 00:27:06,130
My God, we must do something.
Yes

188
00:27:10,910 --> 00:27:12,800
Okay ... we'll help you, come on.

189
00:27:13,560 --> 00:27:15,415
They decided that they could not let it roam.

190
00:27:15,417 --> 00:27:19,561
Cosi 'made it up, and they put her in the back seat of the car.

191
00:27:20,920 --> 00:27:22,950
They thought to take her to the police station more 'close ...

192
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:25,071
... And they would know what to do for her.

193
00:27:26,640 --> 00:27:30,340
Her husband felt 'a strange noise from the back seat.

194
00:27:31,380 --> 00:27:32,825
I watch 'in the rearview mirror ...

195
00:27:32,860 --> 00:27:37,860
There was a woman ... this time with a bullet hole in his head ...

196
00:27:39,850 --> 00:27:47,410
The wife cried, 'as crazy, the husband brake' and the woman was carrying the baby.

197
00:27:48,870 --> 00:27:51,270
The couple look 'on the back of the car e. ..

198
00:27:52,800 --> 00:27:56,980
and their son was safe and sound in the seat.

199
00:27:57,130 --> 00:27:58,800
The woman ... gone.

200
00:28:01,120 --> 00:28:05,140
The allocation husband 'again, when suddenly ...

201
00:28:06,130 --> 00:28:06,930
Look in the back seat and there was a woman ...

202
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,960
But this time ... she cut 'head!

203
00:28:14,990 --> 00:28:20,590
When the police came 'on the bloody crime scene, in the following days ...

204
00:28:21,565 --> 00:28:25,165
they found the decapitated bodies of the two parents

205
00:28:26,150 --> 00:28:28,265
but the baby was ... disappeared.

206
00:28:33,280 --> 00:28:34,910
People think, 'that ...

207
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:37,040
Mary Hatchet ...

208
00:28:38,090 --> 00:28:41,420
had brought the child to the grave with her.

209
00:28:41,490 --> 00:28:44,690
'Cause before he died, the mother had separated from her daughter.

210
00:28:44,700 --> 00:28:46,240
They never had to do it.

211
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:53,400
She was buried here in the shadow of King Park.

212
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,610
Each year in the "Night of Blood"

213
00:28:56,820 --> 00:28:59,820
she comes back to claim some other head.

214
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,760
And he will 'until' not rediscover 'his own daughter.

215
00:29:09,400 --> 00:29:12,550
Boys ... look up ...

216
00:29:18,290 --> 00:29:23,270
not 'a plane flying low ... so be careful ...

217
00:29:24,990 --> 00:29:27,020
because 'this is the "Night of Blood"

218
00:29:35,650 --> 00:29:36,650
What a fool.

219
00:29:54,130 --> 00:29:55,180
Damn!

220
00:29:57,330 --> 00:29:58,790
Someone for this service?

221
00:29:58,792 --> 00:30:00,220
I understand. Where is the fuse box?

222
00:30:00,230 --> 00:30:01,000
In the basement.

223
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:03,450
Jen! Bring the ass here.

224
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,360
- Jen you've opened the door?
- No.

225
00:30:20,130 --> 00:30:23,130
- You never open this door?
- No.

226
00:30:26,630 --> 00:30:27,330
What the fuck?

227
00:30:28,050 --> 00:30:29,930
But who cares, just close it!

228
00:30:34,130 --> 00:30:36,190
Oh, it looks a bit 'creepy.

229
00:30:36,225 --> 00:30:38,040
That this terrible thing.

230
00:30:38,410 --> 00:30:40,410
Hey guys, look.

231
00:30:42,920 --> 00:30:43,920
Oh, my God

232
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:56,800
Give me something.

233
00:31:07,480 --> 00:31:10,960
- Chris, opened the door.
- No, you open it, the damn door.

234
00:31:10,965 --> 00:31:11,355
I do not open anything.

235
00:31:11,365 --> 00:31:13,650
- Open it yourself.
- Okay.

236
00:31:21,895 --> 00:31:23,500
Good night, boys!

237
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:24,895

What ails them? Give it to me.

241
00:31:31,595 --> 00:31:33,320
What the fuck is going on here?

242
00:31:33,355 --> 00:31:33,850
There are two shits.

243
00:31:34,670 --> 00:31:38,480
Have you lost all your friends we did scream like puppies.

244
00:31:38,515 --> 00:31:40,095
What a good, little brother ...

245
00:31:40,130 --> 00:31:41,970
What the fuck! We want to stay.

246
00:31:41,980 --> 00:31:42,530
Come on, we took the liquor.

247
00:31:42,540 --> 00:31:44,800
A whole box, man.

I'm telling you, "Mom wants my sausage."

255
00:32:33,260 --> 00:32:37,260
No, no, no friend I can, 'cause she wants to keep secret.

256
00:32:38,600 --> 00:32:40,300
You know, only VIP friend.

257
00:32:40,335 --> 00:32:42,000
And how did you do, man?

258
00:32:42,290 --> 00:32:44,290

259
00:32:46,270 --> 00:32:48,660

What was it?

263
00:33:01,660 --> 00:33:04,660
I do not want to see these things, man.

264
00:33:08,360 --> 00:33:12,360
This fucking DiToma Jones reminds me of my father's prick, man.

265
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,370
Friend ... You have inherited this house from your father?

266
00:33:23,090 --> 00:33:25,860
Fantastic ... have earned a point for that. You know, right?

267
00:33:25,980 --> 00:33:27,980
- A point?
- There is no point to enter.

268
00:33:27,990 --> 00:33:30,880
- Great.
- Do not wear limits.

269
00:33:31,890 --> 00:33:34,520
Well ... you guys have fun.

270
00:33:40,260 --> 00:33:41,520
Hello,

271
00:33:53,530 --> 00:33:55,870
- How are you doing, man?
- How are you, bastard?

272
00:33:58,040 --> 00:33:59,785
How's this fresh meat?

273
00:33:59,820 --> 00:34:01,820
- Be more 'kind, you idiot.
- What did you say?

274
00:34:02,560 --> 00:34:04,930
I said you were a head of ...

275
00:34:05,030 --> 00:34:07,170
Want a cold margarita?

276
00:34:07,205 --> 00:34:10,020
Come on man, I need a cold drink. Look, look.

277
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:13,950
I was nine. I got up to go pee '.

278
00:34:14,623 --> 00:34:18,829
I ... I heard this noise coming from the bedroom of my parents ...

279
00:34:18,835 --> 00:34:21,451
looked like a pig screaming.

280
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:25,771
So 'I got out of bed, walked down the aisle ...

281
00:34:25,780 --> 00:34:27,205
... I opened the door ...

282
00:34:28,580 --> 00:34:31,530
... And I saw that my father fucked my ass ... my mother ...

283
00:34:36,130 --> 00:34:39,440
and this damn album of Tom Jones, a friend ... very touching, my friend ...

284
00:34:40,150 --> 00:34:42,150
It looks very sexy, man ... hot.

285
00:34:42,880 --> 00:34:44,220
No, I hate ...

286
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:47,610
You and Mom 'hot ... I hate that.

287
00:34:49,490 --> 00:34:51,020
That '... Tom Rey.

288
00:34:55,280 --> 00:34:57,690
Hey man, it seems as if ... something you were breaking.

289
00:34:57,725 --> 00:34:58,870
Calm down man, calm down.

290
00:34:59,210 --> 00:35:00,835
There 's an icebreaker in the fridge ...

291
00:35:01,670 --> 00:35:02,903
That does not make sense.

292
00:35:02,906 --> 00:35:04,800
This is 'the most' surprising of all the blades of blenders.

293
00:35:04,860 --> 00:35:05,860
No, no, my friend I think you're right.

294
00:35:06,020 --> 00:35:07,020
- I tell you, is wrong.
- Small ...

295
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:08,850
You're wrong!

296
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:10,460
What the fuck is going on here, guys?

297
00:35:10,670 --> 00:35:12,915
My love can not 'do a cold margarita.

298
00:35:12,950 --> 00:35:15,470
The blender does not work ... It breaks the ice.

299
00:35:15,860 --> 00:35:19,290
No, no, 'an old blender, there is' an icebreaker in the fridge, you idiot.

300
00:35:20,580 --> 00:35:21,980
Just put it in the ice-breaker.

301
00:35:23,110 --> 00:35:27,930
Your mom and hours' sleep with your father, as we speak ...

302
00:35:27,940 --> 00:35:30,640
and your uncle is picking them to sell the video on the street.

303
00:35:32,630 --> 00:35:33,865
Holy shit!

304
00:35:33,900 --> 00:35:37,900
- Attack of the Killer Tomatoes, man.
- What 'this?

305
00:35:37,930 --> 00:35:40,330
A horror movie old school, man.

306
00:35:41,410 --> 00:35:43,100
We must see this.

307
00:35:47,050 --> 00:35:55,640
No, I know ... I feel it 'better if I stay here and keep your ass ...

308
00:35:55,675 --> 00:35:57,330
... To touch me everywhere all night.

309
00:35:57,365 --> 00:36:00,030
However, men's shorts are much more 'comfortable ....

310
00:36:00,065 --> 00:36:01,490
... And I take the piss easy.

311
00:36:01,525 --> 00:36:03,190
This' baby, but you do not have the ass.

312
00:36:03,310 --> 00:36:08,570
What? What 'this?
- Oh my God!

313
00:36:09,660 --> 00:36:11,530
You're right ... to kill this cute little thing.

314
00:36:11,920 --> 00:36:16,020
No, no, I think you're one of the hind most 'beautiful I have ever seen.

315
00:36:16,630 --> 00:36:18,500
- With small ...
- It ', nothing.

316
00:36:18,535 --> 00:36:21,880
What do you prefer? Do you prefer shorts or thongs?

317
00:36:21,915 --> 00:36:25,760
That 's a good question ... depends on the ass honestly.

318
00:36:25,795 --> 00:36:28,200
if the woman has a flat ass like an ant, there 'nothing that is fine ...

319
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:29,680
Wait, that means a flat ass like an ant?

320
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:35,160
And 'the butt plate ... and oval ... understood.

321
00:36:35,930 --> 00:36:38,260
But if you want an opinion, I would say shorts for men ...

322
00:36:38,295 --> 00:36:41,720
Specialemnte the Brazilian. They are made for the thong.

323
00:36:41,755 --> 00:36:46,450
You got it right there, I'm dying to see one.

324
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,190
Leaving little to the imagination ...

325
00:36:48,225 --> 00:36:50,490
Very nice boobs ...

326
00:36:50,500 --> 00:36:54,420
I do not know, I still think that thongs are better ... I mean ...

327
00:36:55,340 --> 00:36:57,380
You know I love to see this stretch out ...

328
00:36:57,540 --> 00:37:00,540
something happens to me when I see shorts on the Brazilian.

329
00:37:00,575 --> 00:37:02,980
Excuse me but what do you think?

330
00:37:04,980 --> 00:37:07,670
- I should have thought ...
- Come on ...

331
00:37:07,705 --> 00:37:10,830
I do not know ... to know what 's more, I touch with my hands.

332
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:13,690
I know that you like.

333
00:37:14,010 --> 00:37:16,690
We are interrupting something?

334
00:37:17,990 --> 00:37:19,220
What 'this?

335
00:37:19,530 --> 00:37:22,530
It '... Attack of the Killer Tomatoes.

336
00:37:23,530 --> 00:37:26,280
Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!

337
00:37:35,870 --> 00:37:37,380
What the fuck ...

338
00:37:37,770 --> 00:37:39,930
Oh, man, I'm sorry.

339
00:37:40,590 --> 00:37:42,790
- Dude, what did you wrong?
- I can not believe you did.

340
00:37:42,800 --> 00:37:43,800
Hey, stop.

341
00:37:43,835 --> 00:37:45,740
Collaborate and listen ...

342
00:37:45,775 --> 00:37:49,810
I was just trying to scare you, ok? "I think my shot was a bit 'wrong ...

343
00:37:49,910 --> 00:37:51,670
Obviously, you broke my window, shit.

344
00:37:51,840 --> 00:37:53,300
Look, Nicol, possiamoi adjust this window ...

345
00:37:53,302 --> 00:37:54,840
before your parents come home.

346
00:37:54,850 --> 00:37:56,725
Damn, you broke the damn window.

347
00:37:56,760 --> 00:37:59,760
It 'seems that I have not had any luck, right?

348
00:38:01,020 --> 00:38:04,630
Do you plan to sleep here tonight? Bring your ass into it.

349
00:38:08,240 --> 00:38:10,650
- What is it?
- Nice shot friend.

350
00:38:15,450 --> 00:38:17,295
I thought you were with Daniels.

351
00:38:17,330 --> 00:38:19,660
There I was, but it smelled so I came here.

359
00:38:40,050 --> 00:38:42,380

360
00:38:42,620 --> 00:38:44,300

361
00:38:44,970 --> 00:38:46,310

00:38:56,780 --> 00:38:58,000
No, no, no ...

366
00:39:00,980 --> 00:39:02,980
Let me help you, my lady ...

367
00:39:12,920 --> 00:39:14,790
How did you meet you and Mary?

368
00:39:14,800 --> 00:39:19,333
Oh, we have lived side by side.

369
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:21,730
And then I moved to Chicago because of my father's work.

370
00:39:22,820 --> 00:39:24,380
So 'you came to see her?

371
00:39:24,415 --> 00:39:26,170
It '. I have to go back in a couple of weeks.

372
00:39:27,170 --> 00:39:28,170
Oh my God, this stinks ...

373
00:39:28,205 --> 00:39:29,920
Well, Chicago would be nice but ...

374
00:39:30,830 --> 00:39:34,830
I know ... I was born here and die 'here.

375
00:39:36,150 --> 00:39:37,620
I absolutely love 's Arizona.

376
00:39:38,080 --> 00:39:40,140
What was it?
- What does the Arizona?

377
00:39:42,290 --> 00:39:47,350
I die, I say, new school, new way of living ...

378
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:51,740
Until 'I realized that the school where I was going was very popular ...

379
00:39:51,775 --> 00:39:54,590
And I did not have to prove anything ... but I have always been very careful.

380
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,590
My God, how in prison.

381
00:39:56,625 --> 00:39:59,410
- Well, you never know ...
What is it?

382
00:39:59,445 --> 00:40:00,410
What do you mean?

383
00:40:01,600 --> 00:40:04,040
Well, in reality '...

384
00:40:07,500 --> 00:40:09,830
I have problems with the girls' large.

385
00:40:12,600 --> 00:40:19,810
They call me ... rat, 'cause I'm young and stuff ...

386
00:40:21,150 --> 00:40:28,820
were very possessive with the boys, as if I were to follow them and go with them ...

387
00:40:28,830 --> 00:40:30,480
- What I've done ...
- What was that ...

388
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:36,000
what 'that counts, I say,' the guy broke up with his girlfriend three months later.

389
00:40:36,630 --> 00:40:41,630
After we met at a party and behaved as if I had committed ...

390
00:40:41,665 --> 00:40:47,110
a horrible crime, and really were afraid of me.

391
00:40:47,145 --> 00:40:50,910
That and 'stupid, I mean, who cares ...

392
00:40:51,770 --> 00:40:54,550
But then, on Monday '...

393
00:40:56,110 --> 00:41:01,070
after the gym ... I was taking a shower e. ..

394
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:02,440
laughing all e. ..

395
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:11,100
I was on my own, and I found it odd, but I have not paid much attention ...

396
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,590
and the last thing I realized after ...

397
00:41:16,360 --> 00:41:21,860
and 'I was with my face on the floor and the water on the head ...

398
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:25,480
I was kicking ass and taking.

399
00:41:27,420 --> 00:41:29,500
You must not talk about these things ...

400
00:41:29,720 --> 00:41:32,085
Do not worry, I have no problems.

401
00:41:32,120 --> 00:41:36,670
It 'was an attack on a group ... and I almost died in the showers.

402
00:41:37,870 --> 00:41:39,670
Shit!

403
00:41:39,750 --> 00:41:41,890
And they have marked me ...

404
00:41:43,390 --> 00:41:45,710
the old way ...

405
00:41:47,610 --> 00:41:50,350
with a knife and a type ...

406
00:41:51,450 --> 00:41:54,280
In short I tattooed a mouse

407
00:41:54,700 --> 00:41:57,700
leg, 'cause that was my nickname ...

408
00:41:59,060 --> 00:42:03,190
- Want to see it?
- Let me see ...

409
00:42:04,060 --> 00:42:05,800

410
00:42:06,970 --> 00:42:08,040
- The mouse ...

411
00:42:09,830 --> 00:42:11,360
I think my vagina if it is eaten ...

00:42:12,960 --> 00:42:16,960
- Oh, my God ..
- Fantastic ...

413
00:42:18,350 --> 00:42:20,180
I was too afraid ...

00:42:45,410 --> 00:42:47,410
Where 'the bathroom?

415
00:42:47,430 --> 00:42:49,185
In this direction ...

416
00:42:49,220 --> 00:42:52,220
I think we have a winner ...

417
00:42:54,450 --> 00:42:55,620
Guys, look for a room.

418
00:43:04,360 --> 00:43:06,800
Do not use my bed ...

You did some shit?

481
00:53:30,030 --> 00:53:33,720
Can I make you something? A "Bloody Mary"?

Can anyone tell me what is happening and do not tell me and 'the wind.

00:54:28,065 --> 00:54:29,320
I don't know" responded Ligio, who then went on.

494
00:54:36,730 --> 00:54:39,570
The damn door and then it flies off the lights.

495
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,320
Probably 'the storm or wind, right?

496
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:44,260
It 's not the storm or wind, Jen.

497
00:54:44,730 --> 00:54:46,810
Come on guys, and 'obvious that someone is trying to deceive us.

Oh, hush!

501
00:54:49,630 --> 00:54:51,470
I was thinking the same thing.

502
00:54:51,480 --> 00:54:56,230
Alex decided to go to the cemetery to lose time and he woke up.

503
00:54:56,265 --> 00:54:59,150
And I tell you what 'happened to another girl, what did you think Alex?

00:54:59,260 --> 00:55:01,010
Listen, you look like a moron.

00:55:01,110 --> 00:55:02,110
Dude, even the ghost replied.

506
00:55:02,820 --> 00:55:03,460
Now you say it was a ghost at the cemetery?

507
00:55:03,740 --> 00:55:06,500
- What are you talking about?
- Of a fucking ghost, Leyna.

508
00:55:06,510 --> 00:55:07,880
Dude, shut up ... there 'no ghost.

509
00:55:07,915 --> 00:55:09,240

I can not leave here.

523
00:56:55,690 --> 00:56:56,730
They died.

524
00:56:57,110 --> 00:56:58,710
Wait, Alex!

525
00:57:03,820 --> 00:57:06,830
Wait a minute, wait a moment ... here.

00:57:13,710 --> 00:57:15,020

528
00:57:18,275 --> 00:57:19,250
Alex, come on!

529
00:57:27,640 --> 00:57:29,360
They died ... let's go.

530
00:57:30,830 --> 00:57:32,690
Corey and Lindsay died.

531
00:57:33,910 --> 00:57:34,910
I forgot the keys.

532
00:58:07,450 --> 00:58:08,450
Come on.

533
00:58:13,440 --> 00:58:16,580
- Are you crazy?
- Gus, we're in deep shit!

534
00:58:16,615 --> 00:58:17,640
What are you talking about?

535
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:18,800
Mary Hatchet ...

536
00:58:18,835 --> 00:58:21,800
Not uscirtene with this nonsense of "Night of Blood" ...

537
00:58:21,860 --> 00:58:23,860
I'm serious, Gus.

538
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,410
Climb ...

539
00:58:37,340 --> 00:58:38,580
Climb!

540
00:58:38,615 --> 00:58:40,510
I will not go 'never in the car with the madman.

541
00:58:40,545 --> 00:58:41,340
Are you kidding?

542
00:58:41,375 --> 00:58:43,080
What do you know him you're at home?

543
00:58:43,090 --> 00:58:45,550
By God, Jen ... and 'Clifford Gus.

544
00:58:47,730 --> 00:58:48,910
Okay, stay here.

545
00:58:48,945 --> 00:58:50,210
Jen, in your car, please!

546
00:58:50,840 --> 00:58:52,830
Oh God, get in the van.

547
00:58:58,760 --> 00:58:59,840
Come on!

548
00:59:02,370 --> 00:59:04,450
Where are we going? We have to go to the police.

549
00:59:04,460 --> 00:59:06,650
What the fuck do you want the police to a ghost?

550
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:11,320
They would have thought 20 years ago.

551
00:59:18,340 --> 00:59:20,540
People think that the old Gus is just a drunk ...

552
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:23,070
But I've seen things you people would not believe ever ...

553
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:30,960
The things that he spent in Vietnam can not be compared to what I have seen

554
00:59:30,995 --> 00:59:33,510
Mary Hatchet by my colleagues ...

I'll stay with you ... I'll stay with her.

565
01:00:54,440 --> 01:00:56,100
And 'this is the place, Gus?

566
01:00:56,980 --> 01:00:59,940
It 'the only grave that I dug in Kings Park.

567
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:05,620
It is a bond between mother and daughter should not have been broken.

568
01:01:05,655 --> 01:01:08,480
E 'to this evil that continues to live.

569
01:01:10,330 --> 01:01:11,900
I told you so ...

570
01:01:12,620 --> 01:01:15,620
She will continue 'until his research' will not find her child ...

571
01:01:17,870 --> 01:01:21,500
Damn idiots ... I told you to bury them together.

572
01:01:23,510 --> 01:01:25,080
What will we do now?

573
01:01:28,890 --> 01:01:29,940
We begin to dig ...

574
01:01:56,710 --> 01:01:58,240
E 'is empty.

575
01:02:27,150 --> 01:02:29,790
Let's see if my key still works ..

576
01:03:56,270 --> 01:03:59,660
Hey ... hey you.

577
01:04:18,110 --> 01:04:19,300
Have you seen them?

578
01:04:21,530 --> 01:04:22,510
See what?

579
01:04:28,950 --> 01:04:30,590
And 'here.

580
01:04:51,310 --> 01:04:52,620
Let's go ... come on ...

581
01:04:56,140 --> 01:04:57,120
Do not tell ...

582
01:05:24,140 --> 01:05:27,040
- What the fuck are we doing here?
- How the hell do I know?

583
01:05:27,075 --> 01:05:31,330
This 'stupid, we had to go to the police, Gus will make them' kill everyone.

584
01:05:31,420 --> 01:05:33,750
Shit, you're right. I'm going to find them.

585
01:05:33,785 --> 01:05:34,760
No

586
01:05:34,795 --> 01:05:36,310
You stay with me and I do not go there.

587
01:05:36,345 --> 01:05:37,570
- But you said ...
- No

588
01:05:37,605 --> 01:05:39,580
I only said to call the police, cursed the police.

589
01:05:40,930 --> 01:05:43,500
Okay, okay ...

590
01:05:45,040 --> 01:05:47,780
- I'm calling them '...
- Okay.

591
01:07:13,850 --> 01:07:15,510
Shit!

592
01:07:16,250 --> 01:07:18,390
Here, I found it!

593
01:07:20,380 --> 01:07:21,430
Let me see.

594
01:07:28,530 --> 01:07:30,830
Well, you think okay?

595
01:07:31,800 --> 01:07:32,750
Of course it is.

596
01:07:34,790 --> 01:07:37,270
These sons of bitches ... Damn!

597
01:07:39,190 --> 01:07:42,770
It says here that Mary gave birth to a healthy baby girl.

598
01:07:44,620 --> 01:07:47,220
Decided it was best to let them believe that the child was born dead ...

599
01:08:08,150 --> 01:08:11,500
I do believe that someone 'that fucking bitch crazy about Mary Hatchet.

600
01:08:12,220 --> 01:08:13,760
The know this thing ...

601
01:08:14,250 --> 01:08:16,050
She was raped by a night watchman.

602
01:08:18,230 --> 01:08:19,520
That was the straw that broke the camel's back.

603
01:08:20,230 --> 01:08:21,840
'Cause they did not do an abortion?

604
01:08:22,580 --> 01:08:23,450
I don't know" responded Ligio, who then went on.

605
01:08:23,485 --> 01:08:25,270
Perhaps the decision was more 'easy to take.

606
01:08:26,020 --> 01:08:28,770
But why 'to make her believe that her baby was dead?

607
01:08:28,850 --> 01:08:30,280
What can I say?

608
01:08:32,910 --> 01:08:36,560
It says here that the child was adopted by Michael and Leslie Jordano.

609
01:08:40,990 --> 01:08:41,320
All this and '...

610
01:09:42,260 --> 01:09:44,730
I hope that is not crazy like her mother

611
01:10:20,880 --> 01:10:23,020
Go away please!

612
01:10:23,550 --> 01:10:25,710
I understand, but I want to be alone at times like these.

613
01:10:44,140 --> 01:10:47,270
Well ... ok.

614
01:10:53,280 --> 01:10:55,200
Can not 'be ...

615
01:10:56,900 --> 01:10:58,790
Do not you think I know my best friend?

616
01:11:01,210 --> 01:11:04,180
You said you saw them both dead in the cellar, she and Corey.

617
01:11:09,880 --> 01:11:11,880
Well, where is' the box?

618
01:11:13,620 --> 01:11:14,620
Great, you ...

619
01:11:22,310 --> 01:11:24,310
Excellent!

620
01:11:26,690 --> 01:11:28,670
Alex?

621
01:11:30,810 --> 01:11:32,220
I never saw the bodies ...

622
01:11:33,040 --> 01:11:35,580
Only blood.

623
01:11:41,910 --> 01:11:43,780
Mary and 'here.

624
01:11:44,160 --> 01:11:46,140
There 'no ghost, Gus!

625
01:11:46,175 --> 01:11:48,290
It 's the daughter of Mary ...

626
01:12:48,100 --> 01:12:49,270
Hither, here ...

627
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:31,850
Are you okay?

628
01:13:33,380 --> 01:13:34,950
Listen, you have to remain silent.

629
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:38,020
Listen to me ... listen ...

630
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:39,520
Come on out of here, ok.

631
01:13:41,070 --> 01:13:42,910
Let's go ... from here.

632
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,010
Shit ...

633
01:13:59,310 --> 01:14:03,130
- My God ..
- Sorry, sorry ...

634
01:14:03,165 --> 01:14:05,730

Look, look ...

637
01:14:11,730 --> 01:14:14,200
I will not let 'anything happen to you.

638
01:14:14,280 --> 01:14:15,640
You know this.

639
01:14:40,290 --> 01:14:41,900

640
01:14:43,210 --> 01:14:46,720

- No. .. and 'in my purse at home.

641
01:14:46,970 --> 01:14:49,550
