00:17:51,868 --> 00:17:54,271
that's a beautiful name,
it suits you.

349
00:17:54,405 --> 00:17:56,040
Yeah, it's the eyes.

350
00:17:56,606 --> 00:17:58,775
Those pretty eyes on you.
It's the...

351
00:18:00,543 --> 00:18:02,545
Just... just put it
down right here?

352
00:18:07,418 --> 00:18:08,651
Uh...
[clearing throat]

353
00:18:08,785 --> 00:18:10,454
Hey,
you know, me and my friends,

354
00:18:10,587 --> 00:18:12,756
we're in town, for just tonight,

355
00:18:12,889 --> 00:18:14,624
and we're getting ready
to throw a little shindig.

356
00:18:14,758 --> 00:18:15,925
A little party at the rental.

357
00:18:16,360 --> 00:18:18,462
You should stop by
when you get off from here.

358
00:18:18,895 --> 00:18:21,165
I'm going out
with friends tonight.

359
00:18:21,831 --> 00:18:24,435
Oh. Boyfriends?

360
00:18:24,567 --> 00:18:27,338
No. Girls' night.

361
00:18:28,172 --> 00:18:30,107
Even better.
Tell 'em to come.

362
00:18:30,241 --> 00:18:33,077
It's gonna be a nice time,
music, beer,

363
00:18:33,210 --> 00:18:35,279
- good times, vibes.
- Anything else?

364
00:18:35,645 --> 00:18:37,914
Um... oh, ice cream.

365
00:18:38,049 --> 00:18:40,084
I'm gonna get some ice cream.

366
00:18:41,185 --> 00:18:45,688
And your phone number
so I can text you the address.

367
00:18:47,425 --> 00:18:48,925
12 Turtle Lake Road?

368
00:18:51,362 --> 00:18:54,999
Wait, what?
How... how'd you know that?

369
00:18:55,732 --> 00:18:57,101
I saw you drive past earlier.

370
00:18:57,234 --> 00:18:59,970
The cabin's
the only thing out that way.

371
00:19:00,804 --> 00:19:03,840
Oh, great.
I was trippin' for a second.

372
00:19:03,974 --> 00:19:05,742
I don't... my bad. Uh...

373
00:19:05,875 --> 00:19:08,912
Girl, you stalkin' me
already, huh? [indistinct]

374
00:19:09,046 --> 00:19:11,415
So, what time's
the party starting?

375
00:19:11,549 --> 00:19:13,017
[Eli] Well, it depends.

376
00:19:13,984 --> 00:19:15,618
What time you get off?

377
00:19:19,056 --> 00:19:21,125
I like to
get off around 6:00.

378
00:19:21,258 --> 00:19:23,994
Mm. And I aim to please.

379
00:19:24,528 --> 00:19:25,862
6:00 it is.

380
00:19:26,263 --> 00:19:27,864
[Chloe] $37.50.

381
00:19:27,998 --> 00:19:30,000
Oh, that's it?
That's light work.

382
00:19:30,733 --> 00:19:32,269
Light work's light work.

383
00:19:32,403 --> 00:19:33,703
You know what I'm sayin'?

384
00:19:35,705 --> 00:19:38,042
Yeah, go ahead, keep the change.

385
00:19:40,311 --> 00:19:44,081
I will see you later,
twilight eyes.

386
00:19:44,215 --> 00:19:46,117
[phone ringing]

387
00:19:46,484 --> 00:19:47,750
[door bell ringing]

388
00:19:48,618 --> 00:19:52,323
[cicadas buzzing]

389
00:20:01,631 --> 00:20:03,134
I still smell it.

390
00:20:07,505 --> 00:20:08,872
[Mark sighing]

391
00:20:10,174 --> 00:20:13,110
Maybe something died
under the cabin.

392
00:20:13,244 --> 00:20:14,478
- [growling]
- Don't say that.

393
00:20:14,612 --> 00:20:16,046
[both chuckling]

394
00:20:16,180 --> 00:20:17,381
Stupid.

395
00:20:22,752 --> 00:20:24,821
I think I know
where it's coming from.

396
00:20:26,923 --> 00:20:28,559
- Is it locked?
- Yeah.

397
00:20:28,691 --> 00:20:30,060
You don't smell it?

398
00:20:31,228 --> 00:20:32,329
A little.

399
00:20:33,030 --> 00:20:34,797
Well, spray
some of Eli's cologne.

400
00:20:34,932 --> 00:20:36,333
That'll get rid of the smell.

401
00:20:36,467 --> 00:20:38,269
I'm not trying to make
this place smell worse.

402
00:20:38,402 --> 00:20:40,204
[Mark] Oh, yeah,
I hear you on that one.

403
00:20:40,337 --> 00:20:41,804
[Shaina chuckling]

404
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:44,975
[Mark] Water.

405
00:20:46,277 --> 00:20:48,112
[Shaina]
We gotta jiggle it, baby.

406
00:20:49,480 --> 00:20:51,215
[both chuckling]

407
00:20:51,348 --> 00:20:52,950
[water rushing]

408
00:20:57,421 --> 00:20:59,822
Oh, that's actually good.
This... this is well water.

409
00:20:59,957 --> 00:21:01,458
- [Shaina muttering]
- You want a sip?

410
00:21:01,592 --> 00:21:03,793
No, I'm gonna stick
to my spring water, thanks.

411
00:21:04,295 --> 00:21:06,630
You know that's actually
tap water in the bottle, right?

412
00:21:06,763 --> 00:21:08,065
I don't believe you.

413
00:21:10,867 --> 00:21:13,270
Oh, took him long enough.
Eli's back.

414
00:21:13,836 --> 00:21:15,072
Yeah, well, shoot,

415
00:21:15,206 --> 00:21:16,440
at least he made it
back one piece.

416
00:21:19,043 --> 00:21:20,910
- Where you been?
- Damn. Gettin' the goods.

417
00:21:21,045 --> 00:21:22,513
Whatchu mean where I been?

418
00:21:22,646 --> 00:21:23,880
You know what it is,
you know what I'm sayin'?

419
00:21:24,014 --> 00:21:26,250
Think fast. All right.

420
00:21:26,883 --> 00:21:28,918
Yeah, see, I'm here.

421
00:21:29,053 --> 00:21:30,787
- [Eli hissing]
- Ow, asshole, that's cold.

422
00:21:30,920 --> 00:21:32,855
- Yeah, here you go.
- [Shaina] Thank you.

423
00:21:32,990 --> 00:21:34,391
[Eli] Yo.

424
00:21:34,525 --> 00:21:36,759
I met this bad shorty
at the store today, man.

425
00:21:36,893 --> 00:21:38,229
- Word.
- Word.

426
00:21:38,362 --> 00:21:39,964
I'm startin'
to feel like this town

427
00:21:40,097 --> 00:21:41,764
is full of, like... like, tens.

428
00:21:41,898 --> 00:21:43,367
Might need a little help with
the fashion and everything,

429
00:21:43,500 --> 00:21:44,734
but...

430
00:21:44,867 --> 00:21:45,868
might be somethin' in the water.

431
00:21:46,470 --> 00:21:48,405
See? That's what
I'm trying to tell you.

432
00:21:48,539 --> 00:21:50,207
You sure you don't wanna
drink this water?

433
00:21:50,341 --> 00:21:52,042
I mean, we have
a straight ten on our hands.

434
00:21:52,176 --> 00:21:53,978
[Eli] What the hell
are y'all talkin' about?

435
00:21:54,111 --> 00:21:57,414
A... anyway, so, I... I...
I told her that, you know,

436
00:21:57,548 --> 00:22:00,251
after she get off she should,
you know, stop by...

437
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:02,486
for a party.

438
00:22:02,620 --> 00:22:04,622
Wait, what? Wait... we were
supposed to have a recoup day.

439
00:22:05,289 --> 00:22:07,291
It... it is.
Whatchu talkin' about?

440
00:22:07,424 --> 00:22:09,293
It's gonna be a nice night,
you know what I'm sayin'?

441
00:22:09,426 --> 00:22:11,161
It's not like
I'm suggesting that,

442
00:22:11,295 --> 00:22:13,863
you know,
we throw a rager or nothing.

443
00:22:13,998 --> 00:22:15,099
Fuck you, Eli.

444
00:22:15,232 --> 00:22:17,635
Wow.
What is wrong with her?

445
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:19,470
I thought you... you didn't do
your job in the shower?

446
00:22:19,603 --> 00:22:21,739
What is... what's...
She all tense and everything.

447
00:22:21,871 --> 00:22:23,974
We're just trying to have
a peaceful night, that's all.

448
00:22:24,108 --> 00:22:25,509
- [Shaina] Mm-hmm.
- Okay. Chill.

449
00:22:25,643 --> 00:22:28,445
Besides, Shaina
and I have somethin' we wanted

450
00:22:28,579 --> 00:22:29,647
to tell you.

451
00:22:30,447 --> 00:22:32,116
Oh, here you go
with the Malcom X voice

452
00:22:32,249 --> 00:22:34,051
and everything, [mumbling]

453
00:22:34,184 --> 00:22:35,552
Why y'all trippin', man?

454
00:22:35,686 --> 00:22:36,786
Whatchu... what, you pregnant
or something?

455
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:38,455
Relax.

456
00:22:38,589 --> 00:22:40,457
We supposed to be chillin',
havin' a good time...

457
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:44,461
Wait.

458
00:22:47,164 --> 00:22:49,233
Are y'all kidding me?

459
00:22:50,668 --> 00:22:52,069
Y'all serious?

460
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:56,906
This is amazing, man.

461
00:22:57,041 --> 00:22:58,942
- What, you serious?
- It is?

462
00:22:59,076 --> 00:23:00,411
[Eli] Yeah, it is.

463
00:23:00,544 --> 00:23:02,379
Y'all have been together
for fuckin' ever.

464
00:23:02,513 --> 00:23:04,748
Y'all are like a... like an
old-ass wrinkled couple, man.

465
00:23:04,881 --> 00:23:05,915
Hey, I was startin' to worry

466
00:23:06,050 --> 00:23:07,117
'cause I thought my man here

467
00:23:07,251 --> 00:23:08,285
was, you know, shootin' blanks.

468
00:23:08,419 --> 00:23:09,687
Pow, you know what I'm sayin'?

469
00:23:09,819 --> 00:23:10,920
Shit, not with this 12-gauge.

470
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:12,456
Okay, whatever.
You know what...

471
00:23:12,589 --> 00:23:14,258
Thanks for your vote
of confidence, though.

472
00:23:14,391 --> 00:23:16,126
I'mma tell you something.
This calls for a toast.

473
00:23:16,260 --> 00:23:18,228
Wait, wait. Yes.
Come on, come on.

474
00:23:18,362 --> 00:23:19,997
- I can't. You know I can't.
- Aw, come on, Shaina.

475
00:23:20,130 --> 00:23:21,732
[mockingly] What do you mean,
"No, I can't?"

476
00:23:21,864 --> 00:23:23,434
You been smokin' weed this
whole dang trip, man, okay?

477
00:23:23,567 --> 00:23:25,402
- And a baby glass of wine...
- No judgements.

478
00:23:25,536 --> 00:23:28,172
...Is not going

479
00:23:28,305 --> 00:23:30,174
Get that, get some... all right,

480
00:23:30,307 --> 00:23:32,743
Come on, come on, come on.

00:23:32,875 --> 00:23:34,111

All right, come on,

00:23:36,680 --> 00:23:37,914
So, cheers.

484
00:23:38,048 --> 00:23:39,916

00:23:40,050 --> 00:23:42,086
- Where... where we at again?

486
00:23:42,219 --> 00:23:45,322
Cheers to havin'

487
00:23:45,456 --> 00:23:46,824
in Shady Grove.

488
00:23:46,957 --> 00:23:49,993
- Wassup.
- [Eli] Yeah, yeah. Mm.

489
00:23:50,494 --> 00:23:52,262
- Yeah, not bad.
- [Shaina] Mm.

490
00:23:53,197 --> 00:23:55,065
- [Mark] Yeah, that's not bad.
- Yeah.

491
00:23:55,499 --> 00:23:57,434
You know what I'm sayin',
you about to be a daddy.

492
00:23:57,568 --> 00:23:58,702
Daddy. Dada.

493
00:23:58,836 --> 00:24:00,471
[chuckling]

494
00:24:06,076 --> 00:24:09,113
[crickets chirping]

495
00:24:12,249 --> 00:24:13,517
[Mark speaking indistinctly]

496
00:24:14,084 --> 00:24:15,352
[Shaina] I'm tired.

497
00:24:15,486 --> 00:24:16,820
[both chuckling]

498
00:24:16,954 --> 00:24:18,489
[Mark] Ah...
Get this fire started.

499
00:24:18,622 --> 00:24:20,791
[Eli] Man, where...
Where is the fire?

500
00:24:20,923 --> 00:24:22,760
What's going on
with all these sticks?

501
00:24:22,892 --> 00:24:24,161
We playin' Tetris
with the sticks

502
00:24:24,294 --> 00:24:25,662
while there supposed
to be a fire?

503
00:24:25,796 --> 00:24:27,698
First of all, that's how
you make a fire, genius.

504
00:24:27,831 --> 00:24:30,300
All right? You... you do teepee
style with, you know, sticks.

505
00:24:30,434 --> 00:24:31,935
Well, this brother think
he a light skin Indian.

506
00:24:32,069 --> 00:24:33,637
What are you, Cherokee?

507
00:24:33,771 --> 00:24:36,340
Man, you supposed to grab it,
like, douse it, poof!

508
00:24:36,473 --> 00:24:38,142
Fire. There you go,
like a microwave.

509
00:24:38,275 --> 00:24:39,943
- What are you doing?
- [Mark] So, right, so,

510
00:24:40,077 --> 00:24:42,079
after you eat the marshmallows,
you gon' eat it with chemicals

511
00:24:42,212 --> 00:24:43,714
and then kill yourself,
that what you're saying?

512
00:24:43,847 --> 00:24:45,282
What are you talkin' about,
eat the marshmallows

513
00:24:45,416 --> 00:24:47,184
- and then kill yourself?
- Chemicals.

514
00:24:47,317 --> 00:24:48,786
So, you a woke, uh, uh, uh,
lumberjack right now.

515
00:24:48,918 --> 00:24:50,421
That's what this is?

516
00:24:50,554 --> 00:24:53,290
- [argument continues]
- [peaceful music playing]

517
00:25:06,904 --> 00:25:07,905

00:41:21,911 --> 00:41:24,415
All right, look,
maybe it was the owner.

866
00:41:24,548 --> 00:41:26,283
Right, what if she came
when we was out?

867
00:41:26,417 --> 00:41:28,085
We weren't gone longer
than an hour,

868
00:41:28,218 --> 00:41:30,354
and did you hear any cars
coming up the driveway?

869
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:32,523
No, baby,
I wasn't paying attention.

870
00:41:34,425 --> 00:41:36,727
Look, I mean,
Chloe's truck is gone.

871
00:41:36,860 --> 00:41:38,162
Did you hear that?

872
00:41:39,730 --> 00:41:42,399
All right, whatever.
But I don't like it.

873
00:41:42,533 --> 00:41:45,068
I don't like this place,
I don't like it here,

874
00:41:45,202 --> 00:41:47,504
I don't like not knowing
where Eli is,

875
00:41:47,638 --> 00:41:50,007
and what's
in this fuckin' pantry

876
00:41:50,140 --> 00:41:52,009
that smells so damn bad...

877
00:41:52,142 --> 00:41:53,644
All right, okay,
okay, okay, okay.

878
00:41:53,777 --> 00:41:55,112
Look, just do me a favor.

879
00:41:55,245 --> 00:41:57,281
Calm down. Breathe.

880
00:41:57,915 --> 00:41:59,216
And this is what today

881
00:41:59,349 --> 00:42:00,184
was supposed to be
all about, right?

882
00:42:00,751 --> 00:42:02,453
We're gonna have
plenty more freakouts

883
00:42:02,586 --> 00:42:04,221
for the rest of our lives.

884
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:06,523
Let's not worry about Eli,

885
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:08,926
or the dead bodies
under the cabin.

886
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:10,594
That's not funny.

887
00:42:10,727 --> 00:42:12,362
[Mark chuckling]

888
00:42:12,496 --> 00:42:14,798
Let's just enjoy our last
few hours of peace and quiet.

889
00:42:15,799 --> 00:42:17,267
Now come have
this nightcap with me.

890
00:42:17,401 --> 00:42:19,203
Okay.
All right.

891
00:42:21,104 --> 00:42:22,406

892
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:30,514

[Shaina sighing]

895
00:42:39,189 --> 00:42:41,792
Tired. What time is it?

896
00:42:42,359 --> 00:42:44,728
[sniffing] Like 9:30.

897
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:49,166
It's cold out here, too.

898
00:42:51,535 --> 00:42:54,104
Let's see if there's a little
life left in this fire.

899
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:00,544
[sighing]

900
00:43:03,313 --> 00:43:04,748
[frightening music]

901
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:06,149
[Shaina] What... look.

902
00:43:06,283 --> 00:43:07,751
There's something out there.

903
00:43:08,519 --> 00:43:09,620
What?

904
00:43:10,287 --> 00:43:12,256
Don't you see it?
There's something out there.

905
00:43:13,190 --> 00:43:14,458
Watching us.

906
00:43:15,492 --> 00:43:17,160
Babe, I don't see anything.

907
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:19,730
Maybe it's just shadows
or somethin' playin' tricks.

908
00:43:19,863 --> 00:43:22,633
Mark, I know what I saw.
And someone is watching us.

909
00:43:22,766 --> 00:43:25,536
O... okay. All right, all right.
I believe you.

910
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,072
Just go inside.

911
00:43:34,578 --> 00:43:35,980
You're not gonna come with me?

912
00:43:36,580 --> 00:43:38,215
I'm gonna put
the fire out first.

913
00:43:38,615 --> 00:43:41,285
Just go on inside,
lock the door and...

914
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:44,154
- wait for me.
- [Shaina] Well, don't be long.

915
00:43:44,288 --> 00:43:45,822
Right behind you.

916
00:43:51,094 --> 00:43:52,629

[foliage rustling]

919
00:44:28,632 --> 00:44:29,700
Eli?

923
00:44:38,875 --> 00:44:42,179
Y'all hear that ringin'?
It's the cops.

924
00:44:42,312 --> 00:44:44,715
[dispatcher] <i>9-1-1 operator.</i>
<i>What's your emergency?</i>

925
00:44:44,848 --> 00:44:48,785
Hello... hello? Yes, yes, yes.
Um, I called earlier.

926
00:44:49,553 --> 00:44:51,888
Me and my girlfriend
are stayin' up over at,

927
00:44:52,023 --> 00:44:53,757
uh, 12 Turtle Lake Road.

928
00:44:53,890 --> 00:44:56,827
<i>- Sir, is this about the cow?</i>
- It's not about the damn cow.

929
00:44:57,527 --> 00:44:59,563
Somebody's out here
messin' with us.

[frightening chord]

937
00:45:45,676 --> 00:45:47,444
- [Shaina] What happened?
- Close all the windows

938
00:45:47,577 --> 00:45:49,379
- a... a... and lock 'em.
- What happened? What's wrong?

939
00:45:49,513 --> 00:45:51,248
- [Mark] Just do it!
- Okay.

940

Fuck.

943
00:45:57,721 --> 00:45:59,389
[Shaina]
What did you see out there?

944
00:46:01,391 --> 00:46:02,826
What was it, Mark?

945
00:46:02,960 --> 00:46:04,227
Um...

946
00:46:04,361 --> 00:46:06,130
[Shaina] What was it?

947
00:46:06,596 --> 00:46:09,100
Uh... I think I saw
somethin' I... in the lake.

948
00:46:09,533 --> 00:46:10,834
I think it was a hand.

949
00:46:10,968 --> 00:46:12,335
What?

950
00:46:12,469 --> 00:46:13,971
I saw a fuckin' hand
in the lake, Shaina.

951
00:46:15,739 --> 00:46:17,708
[Shaina]
Like, a human hand?

952
00:46:17,841 --> 00:46:20,111
[Mark]
Yeah. I'm pretty sure of it.

953
00:46:20,777 --> 00:46:22,279
We need to get outta here.

954
00:46:22,713 --> 00:46:25,215
Right, right, right.
Give me your phone.

955
00:46:25,348 --> 00:46:26,450
It's in the car.

956
00:46:26,883 --> 00:46:28,719
Why the fuck
would you leave it in the car?

957
00:46:28,852 --> 00:46:31,254
I don't know, Mark.
Where's your phone?

958
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:34,058
Where are the keys?

959
00:46:34,725 --> 00:46:36,194
[Shaina]
You're not going out there.

960
00:46:36,326 --> 00:46:37,527
I'm just going to get the phone.

961
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:39,063
- Mm-mm.
- Babe, I'll be right back,

Eli, it's me.

972
00:47:36,020 --> 00:47:38,688
Call Shaina's phone as soon
as you get this message.

973
00:47:38,822 --> 00:47:40,258
Somebody's out here
fuckin' with us

974
00:47:40,390 --> 00:47:41,858
and we're about to bounce.

975
00:47:41,993 --> 00:47:43,560
I'mma try texting you.

976
00:47:47,165 --> 00:47:48,732

Did you recognize the car?

980
00:48:05,983 --> 00:48:07,018
No.

981
00:48:07,751 --> 00:48:09,519
Look,
just turn off all the lights

982
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:11,321
and stay away from the windows.

983
00:48:21,398 --> 00:48:23,067
You called Eli, didn't you?

984
00:48:24,068 --> 00:48:25,102
Yeah.

985
00:48:25,669 --> 00:48:27,838
But he, uh... he didn't pick up.

986
00:48:29,673 --> 00:48:30,807
[Shaina] Sounds weird, but...

987
00:48:30,942 --> 00:48:32,642
I heard you calling him, Mark.

988
00:48:33,410 --> 00:48:35,612
From in here.
I heard you calling him.

989
00:48:36,913 --> 00:48:38,448
That doesn't make sense.
Are you sure?

990
00:48:38,582 --> 00:48:39,850
[Shaina] Call him again.

991
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:46,556
Shh. Get... get down.

- Taylor?

- Hey.
- Oh, hey, sorry.

999
00:49:19,389 --> 00:49:20,624
I didn't know anyone was home.

1000
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:22,492
Uh, nah, it's all good,
we were, uh,

1001
00:49:22,626 --> 00:49:25,562
just in the back
takin' a, uh, nap.

1002
00:49:26,197 --> 00:49:27,298
Uh, come in, come in.

1003
00:49:27,931 --> 00:49:29,566
I really didn't mean to
interrupt.

1004
00:49:29,699 --> 00:49:31,601
It's just I can't
seem to find my car keys.

1005
00:49:31,735 --> 00:49:33,271
Have you guys seen them?

1006
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:36,340
No, I, uh... I haven't seen ca...
Have you seen car keys?

1007
00:49:36,473 --> 00:49:38,142
I haven't seen anything,
I'm sorry.

1008
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,510
Okay, thanks.
It was worth a shot.

1009
00:49:40,644 --> 00:49:42,013
I'm just gonna go check outside.

1010
00:49:42,146 --> 00:49:43,981
[Shaina] No, wait.
Maybe you can help us.

1011
00:49:44,115 --> 00:49:47,351
Um, when we got back,
Eli was gone, and...

1012
00:49:48,119 --> 00:49:50,720
he's not picking up his phone,
so, I was just thinking,

1013
00:49:50,854 --> 00:49:53,057
maybe since he was
with your friend...

1014
00:49:53,190 --> 00:49:55,159
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
you want me to text Chloe?

1015
00:49:55,293 --> 00:49:57,527
- That would be great.
- Yeah, of course. No problem.

1016
00:49:58,162 --> 00:50:00,597
Hey, uh, you, uh,
want some water or somethin'?

1017
00:50:00,730 --> 00:50:01,999
Yeah, I'd love water.

1018
00:50:02,432 --> 00:50:03,667
Thank you.

1019
00:50:04,335 --> 00:50:06,903
[keyboard clacking]

1020
00:50:10,840 --> 00:50:11,908
Hey.

1021
00:50:14,045 --> 00:50:15,179
Are these yours?

1022
00:50:16,147 --> 00:50:18,682
Oh, my gosh, thank you so much.

1023
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:23,154
- You're a lifesaver.
- Where'd you find those?

1024
00:50:24,654 --> 00:50:25,922
Just over there on the counter.

1025
00:50:27,358 --> 00:50:29,659
But Taylor, you didn't
come in here, did you?

1026
00:50:30,995 --> 00:50:33,064
No, you guys
didn't bring them inside?

1027
00:50:33,530 --> 00:50:36,233
[Mark] Um, maybe Eli.

1028
00:50:37,301 --> 00:50:38,568
[cell phone buzzing]

1029
00:50:39,536 --> 00:50:40,804
Oh, it's Chloe.

1030
00:50:41,571 --> 00:50:42,906
Okay, she said,
"We're at drifters."

1031
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:44,674
Which is a bar in town, so...

1032
00:50:44,808 --> 00:50:46,177
And Eli's with her?

1033
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:47,945
[Taylor] Yes,
she said Eli is with her,

1034
00:50:48,079 --> 00:50:50,081
but he's really
not feeling well.

1035
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:53,184
He's sick, so he's been
in the bathroom, I guess.

1036
00:50:54,218 --> 00:50:55,852
[Mark] I mean,
that sound about right.

1037
00:50:55,987 --> 00:50:57,121
Yeah.

1038
00:50:57,254 --> 00:50:58,822
Uh, so... so, I mean,
what you wanna do,

1039
00:50:58,956 --> 00:51:00,324
you wanna wait for him here
or you wanna go

1040
00:51:00,458 --> 00:51:01,691
- pick him up?
- I wanna go.

1041
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:02,994
We can find us some cheapy hotel

1042
00:51:03,127 --> 00:51:04,594
along the way, I don't care.

1043
00:51:04,728 --> 00:51:07,031
But this place
is freaking me out.

1044
00:51:07,999 --> 00:51:09,967
All right, well, let's just
go pack up our things

1045
00:51:10,101 --> 00:51:11,568
and we'll just
get him on the way out.

1046
00:51:11,701 --> 00:51:12,970
Okay.

1047
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:15,306
Is everything all right?

1048
00:51:15,739 --> 00:51:17,074
[Shaina] Yeah, it's just...

1049
00:51:17,208 --> 00:51:18,908
I'm not used to
all this peace and quiet.

1050
00:51:19,043 --> 00:51:19,944
It's just...

1051
00:51:20,077 --> 00:51:21,678
It's kind of making me crazy,

1052
00:51:21,811 --> 00:51:23,646
and so I think
we're just gonna cut this short

1053
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:24,949
and go home a little early.

1054
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,417
Mm, okay.

1055
00:51:26,549 --> 00:51:27,884
[knocking on door]

1056
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:31,088
Are you guys expecting someone?

1057
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:34,891
No.

1058
00:51:39,430 --> 00:51:41,232
[door creaks open]

1059
00:51:43,733 --> 00:51:44,868
[Wingrad] Howdy, folks.

1060
00:51:45,002 --> 00:51:46,504
I'm Sherriff Wingrad.

1061
00:51:47,138 --> 00:51:49,407
I heard there was a disturbance
out here this evening.

1062
00:51:49,539 --> 00:51:51,608
Yeah, yeah, that... that was me.

1063
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:57,547
Taylor, what are you doing here?

1064
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:00,017
I was hangin' out with Chloe.

1065
00:52:00,451 --> 00:52:02,186
Did she ditch you again?

1066
00:52:03,753 --> 00:52:04,854
When are you
gonna learn that girl

1067
00:52:04,989 --> 00:52:06,357
only has one thing on her mind?

1068
00:52:06,490 --> 00:52:07,458
[Taylor] I know.

1069
00:52:07,590 --> 00:52:09,559
[eerie music plays]

1070
00:52:09,692 --> 00:52:12,129
All right.
What seems to be the problem?

1071
00:52:13,364 --> 00:52:14,999
Um...

1072
00:52:15,698 --> 00:52:17,501
somebody's been messin' with us.

1073
00:52:17,634 --> 00:52:19,003
Messin' how?

1074
00:52:19,836 --> 00:52:22,073
Somebody was
watching us down by the fire.

1075
00:52:23,307 --> 00:52:24,475
All right.

1076
00:52:24,607 --> 00:52:26,143
Can you describe 'em for me?

1077
00:52:27,344 --> 00:52:30,580
It was dark,
and I only got a glimpse.

1078
00:52:32,450 --> 00:52:33,783
What about you?

1079
00:52:34,584 --> 00:52:36,886
Well, no, I mean,

1080
00:52:37,021 --> 00:52:39,656
I actually...
I didn't see anything.

1081
00:52:42,326 --> 00:52:46,230
So, you think you saw
somebody but you can't be sure.

1082
00:52:47,664 --> 00:52:48,966
Mark, why don't you tell her

1083
00:52:49,100 --> 00:52:50,900
about what you saw
down at the lake?

1084
00:52:54,305 --> 00:52:56,207
It's probably best
if I show you.

1085
00:52:59,210 --> 00:53:00,277
Lead the way.

1086
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:02,980
Taylor, do you think
you can keep an eye

1087
00:53:03,114 --> 00:53:04,714
on that young lady
while we're gone?

1088
00:53:04,848 --> 00:53:07,251
Yeah, not like I have
anywhere else to be.

1089
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:09,053
All right.

1090
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,155
Lock the door behind us,
just to be safe.

1091
00:53:13,457 --> 00:53:14,724
All right, let's go.

1092
00:53:16,659 --> 00:53:17,927
What'd I miss?

1093
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:29,006
Look. It was...

1094
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:31,674
it was over here.

1095
00:53:33,643 --> 00:53:35,879
[mysterious music plays]

1096
00:53:36,846 --> 00:53:38,115
Hey, watch it, watch it.

1097
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:44,021
What am I lookin' for?

1098
00:53:44,754 --> 00:53:46,756
I... I came down to get water

1099
00:53:46,890 --> 00:53:48,725
to... to put out the fire,
okay, and...

1100
00:53:49,759 --> 00:53:51,195
I'm tellin' you, it was a noise,

1101
00:53:51,328 --> 00:53:52,896
or a splash or somethin',

1102
00:53:53,030 --> 00:53:55,399
and I shine my light
and it was right there.

1103
00:53:55,533 --> 00:53:56,766
It was a fuckin' hand.

1104
00:53:56,900 --> 00:53:59,669
[eerie chanting]

1105
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:02,540
I notice you kids
are having a little party

1106
00:54:02,672 --> 00:54:03,941
back in the cabin.

1107
00:54:04,707 --> 00:54:05,842
You take any drugs?

1108
00:54:06,377 --> 00:54:08,412
I mean, I had
a couple beers, all right?

1109
00:54:08,546 --> 00:54:11,681
But... I know it sounds crazy,
but I know what I saw.

1110
00:54:11,814 --> 00:54:13,384
It was
a severed hand in the water.

1111
00:54:13,517 --> 00:54:14,851
[Wingrad] Okay, relax now.

1112
00:54:14,985 --> 00:54:16,520
I'm not trying
to bust you, I'm just

1113
00:54:16,654 --> 00:54:19,190
trying to figure out
what it is you really saw.

1114
00:54:19,323 --> 00:54:23,060
[eerie chanting]

1115
00:54:28,332 --> 00:54:29,400
Oh, shit.

1116
00:54:31,202 --> 00:54:32,269
Yo...

1117
00:54:33,504 --> 00:54:34,837
Fuck.

1118
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:38,309
[sighs]

1119
00:54:38,442 --> 00:54:40,044
Do you wear glasses or contacts?

1120
00:54:41,878 --> 00:54:43,180
When I read, yeah.

1121
00:54:43,314 --> 00:54:46,083
And did you have 'em in earlier?

1122
00:54:47,017 --> 00:54:49,119
- No.
- [Taylor] Okay.

1123
00:54:49,253 --> 00:54:51,522
Chloe just said
that they're gonna head back

1124
00:54:51,655 --> 00:54:53,524
once your friend is
good enough to ride in her car

1125
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:54,791
without getting too sick.

1126
00:54:54,924 --> 00:54:56,460
[Shaina sighing]
Fuckin' asshole.

1127
00:54:56,594 --> 00:54:58,295
Uh, in his defense,
no one ever says no to Chloe.

1128
00:54:58,429 --> 00:54:59,964
I could see that.

1129
00:55:00,097 --> 00:55:02,199
Eli made a joke that it must be
something in the water.

1130
00:55:03,100 --> 00:55:04,901
It's more like
a limited gene pool.

1131
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:06,303
Everyone in Shady Grove
is related,

1132
00:55:06,437 --> 00:55:08,105
which makes dating a nightmare.

1133
00:55:08,239 --> 00:55:09,940
It's also
really hard to stand out

1134
00:55:10,074 --> 00:55:11,741
when everyone
looks the exact same.

1135
00:55:12,376 --> 00:55:14,211
It's why I got the ink.
To stand out.

1136
00:55:14,844 --> 00:55:17,181
- Do you wanna see?
- Sure.

1137
00:55:27,324 --> 00:55:29,126
- [peaceful music plays]
- Check it out.

1138
00:55:29,260 --> 00:55:31,629
[Shaina] Oh, my God.
It's amazing.

1139
00:55:32,563 --> 00:55:34,064
[Taylor] I mean,
that's what everyone tells me,

1140
00:55:34,198 --> 00:55:35,798
but I can't really
see it for myself.

1141
00:55:37,134 --> 00:55:38,868
How long did it take?

1142
00:55:41,105 --> 00:55:42,539
Took about a year, on and off.

1143
00:55:42,673 --> 00:55:44,608
Basically whenever
I had money to pay for it.

1144
00:55:45,175 --> 00:55:46,977
[Shaina] It looks painful.
Did it hurt?

1145
00:55:47,678 --> 00:55:51,548
Not really, I mean,
it's kind of the point, right?

1146
00:55:51,682 --> 00:55:53,450
Yeah, I guess.

1147
00:55:54,051 --> 00:55:55,152
Do you have any tattoos?

1148
00:55:55,286 --> 00:55:57,021
Yeah, just this little...

1149
00:55:59,957 --> 00:56:02,026
I actually got it with Eli.

1150
00:56:05,029 --> 00:56:06,363
It's so cute.

1151
00:56:07,298 --> 00:56:09,433
[Shaina] Mark used to
have this really tiny coupe.

1152
00:56:09,566 --> 00:56:12,802
Um, and I'm... mind you,
I'm super claustrophobic,

1153
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:14,772
so I refused to sit in the back,

1154
00:56:14,904 --> 00:56:16,540
and Eli
had to every single time.

1155
00:56:16,674 --> 00:56:18,808
And so, he used to kick the
back of the seat and scream,

1156
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:21,045
"Oh, Shaina needs
to spread her wings."

1157
00:56:21,679 --> 00:56:23,614
Now, I know
that he was making fun of me,

1158
00:56:23,747 --> 00:56:25,049
but it kinda stuck.

1159
00:56:25,182 --> 00:56:28,085
- Like, literally.
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

1160
00:56:28,918 --> 00:56:30,721
Do you remember seein' a farm

1161
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:32,456
that you passed on the way here?

1162
00:56:33,757 --> 00:56:35,392
Yes, what... why?

1163
00:56:35,526 --> 00:56:37,927
Yeah, well,
that's the Hilton boys' farm.

1164
00:56:38,062 --> 00:56:40,497
We've been
gettin' complaints for years

1165
00:56:40,631 --> 00:56:43,133
about their improper
disposal of livestock.

1166
00:56:43,267 --> 00:56:46,070
Sometimes they just pile 'em up

1167
00:56:46,203 --> 00:56:48,005
in a big pile and burn 'em.

1168
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:50,941
Causing a funk
you would not believe.

1169
00:56:51,075 --> 00:56:53,910
Other times,
they'll just chop up the bits

1170
00:56:54,044 --> 00:56:55,979
and toss 'em right in there.

1171
00:56:57,614 --> 00:57:00,451
The... well,
I don't know, all right?

1172
00:57:00,584 --> 00:57:02,453
Maybe. I... maybe.

1173
00:57:03,287 --> 00:57:05,255
Look,
you are not the first person

1174
00:57:05,389 --> 00:57:07,458
who's called
in a panic because some

1175
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:11,195
nasty carcass parts
have washed up to shore.

1176
00:57:11,829 --> 00:57:13,863
But, um,
while the Hilton boys are

1177
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:16,200
certainly not rocket scientists,

1178
00:57:16,333 --> 00:57:19,103
they are not killers.

1179
00:57:22,973 --> 00:57:25,509
[eerie chanting]

1180
00:57:25,642 --> 00:57:29,146
[Wingrad] All right, hoh, hoh!
Hey, are you okay?

1181
00:57:30,514 --> 00:57:32,282
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah, I just...

1182
00:57:32,983 --> 00:57:34,318
got lightheaded for a second.

1183
00:57:36,387 --> 00:57:38,155
I'm gonna
ask you one more time...

1184
00:57:39,356 --> 00:57:40,657
are you on somethin'?

1185
00:57:40,791 --> 00:57:42,192
No.

1186
00:57:42,760 --> 00:57:44,128
All right, look, this is...

1187
00:57:44,261 --> 00:57:45,262
A lot's been happenin'
in the day, okay?

1188
00:57:45,396 --> 00:57:47,164
I... I just forgot to eat.

1189
00:57:48,599 --> 00:57:49,867
All right, well,

1190
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:51,468
let's get you back to the cabin.

1191
00:57:52,069 --> 00:57:53,337
Come on.

1192
00:57:55,139 --> 00:57:56,707
Did you and Eli ever hook up?

1193
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,509
No. God, no.

1194
00:57:58,642 --> 00:58:00,144
He is not my type.

1195
00:58:01,345 --> 00:58:04,214
- And your boyfriend is...
- More my type?

1196
00:58:04,348 --> 00:58:05,616
- Oh.
- [Shaina] Yeah.

1197
00:58:06,116 --> 00:58:07,917
- Nice.
- Mm-hmm.

1198
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:10,387
They're both really cute.

1199
00:58:11,822 --> 00:58:12,890
[Shaina] Oh, you have to...

1200
00:58:13,023 --> 00:58:14,591
[sinister music plays]

1201
00:58:14,725 --> 00:58:15,993
[Shaina] Wait...

1202
00:58:17,494 --> 00:58:18,928
how did you know to do that?

1203
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:20,330
Jiggle it?

1204
00:58:21,298 --> 00:58:24,401
Oh, I... I guess
I saw you guys do it earlier.

1205
00:58:27,204 --> 00:58:29,373
- [knocking on door]
- [Wingrad] Hey!

1206
00:58:31,275 --> 00:58:33,076
[Shaina] What...
What happened to him?

1207
00:58:34,211 --> 00:58:35,746
[Wingrad] Exactly
what I've been askin'.

1208
00:58:35,879 --> 00:58:37,448
[Mark] I'm good.

1209
00:58:37,581 --> 00:58:39,583
[Wingrad] I already asked him
