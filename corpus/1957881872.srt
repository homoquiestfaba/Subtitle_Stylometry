I don't honestly think either

one of us is ever gonna look

31
00:03:00,847 --> 00:03:01,982
like that, do you?

32
00:03:01,982 --> 00:03:03,016
Not if you sit in that chair,

33
00:03:03,016 --> 00:03:04,384
you won't.

34
00:03:04,384 --> 00:03:05,786
Maybe if I wore that outfit.

35
00:03:05,786 --> 00:03:07,387
What outfit?

36
00:03:07,387 --> 00:03:08,588
She's wearing a bra

37
00:03:08,588 --> 00:03:10,824
and dental floss.

38
00:03:10,824 --> 00:03:12,325
Did I leave the door open?

39
00:03:12,325 --> 00:03:13,760
I used my key.

40
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:15,562
It's amazing, isn't it,

41
00:03:15,562 --> 00:03:17,864
how simply watching an exercise

42
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,566
program can actually affect

43
00:03:19,566 --> 00:03:22,636
the metabolic process?

44
00:03:22,636 --> 00:03:24,438
Might those be cookies in a bowl

45
00:03:24,438 --> 00:03:25,705
of milk?

46
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,808
They have fiber in them.

47
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:28,942
Besides, haven't you heard

48
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:30,277
your whole life how cookies

49
00:03:30,277 --> 00:03:31,344
and milk make the perfect

50
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:32,379

00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,483
Oh, joy, more workmen

00:03:36,483 --> 00:03:37,551
have arrived.

54
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:38,585
Well, at least they're

55
00:03:38,585 --> 00:03:40,420
on schedule.

56
00:03:45,692 --> 00:03:46,726
Do your best.

57
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:48,462
Always.

58
00:03:51,565 --> 00:03:53,300
Thanks, Dad.

59
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:55,669
Hey, guys.

60
00:03:55,669 --> 00:03:56,770
Yo, Tim, how's it going?

61
00:03:56,770 --> 00:03:57,804
Good, my mom baked

62
00:03:57,804 --> 00:03:59,673
Mrs. Hutman some muffins.

63
00:04:05,579 --> 00:04:06,913
Does this go in

64
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,983
the dishwasher?

65
00:04:09,983 --> 00:04:11,885
Mary?

66
00:04:11,885 --> 00:04:12,919
Brian was good

67
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:14,087
with his hands.

68
00:04:14,087 --> 00:04:15,388
He built the gardening shed

69
00:04:15,388 --> 00:04:16,690
for Mom.

70
00:04:16,690 --> 00:04:17,891
Just about single handedly kept

71
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:19,059
this house on its

72
00:04:19,059 --> 00:04:20,827
foundation until she died.

73
00:04:20,827 --> 00:04:21,928
Your mother would be very

74
00:04:21,928 --> 00:04:23,063
proud of how beautifully you've

75
00:04:23,063 --> 00:04:27,334
taken care of this house.

76
00:04:27,334 --> 00:04:28,401
Say, are you in the mood

77
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:29,503
to peel beets?

78
00:04:29,503 --> 00:04:31,538
Ooh, no, thank you.

79
00:04:31,538 --> 00:04:32,672
I don't even want to be in the

80
00:04:32,672 --> 00:04:34,708
same house with beets.

81
00:04:34,708 --> 00:04:36,009
Bye, neighbor.

82
00:04:36,009 --> 00:04:37,911
(vegetables snapping)

83
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:43,783
(drill saw powering down)

84
00:04:45,118 --> 00:04:47,754
Hey, Tim, do me a favor.

85
00:04:47,754 --> 00:04:48,822
I have a problem with the hose.

86
00:04:48,822 --> 00:04:49,990
Some kind of blockage.

87
00:04:49,990 --> 00:04:51,024
It'll only take a minute.

88
00:04:51,024 --> 00:04:52,659
I'd really appreciate the help.

89
00:04:52,659 --> 00:04:53,760
Let me get these boards in

90
00:04:53,760 --> 00:04:55,529
the house. Good thinking.

91
00:05:04,938 --> 00:05:06,473
I just called you.

92
00:05:06,473 --> 00:05:07,908
I'm not home.

93
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:08,942
And I won't be

94
00:05:08,942 --> 00:05:09,976
until much later.

95
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:11,011
You want some more coffee?

96
00:05:11,011 --> 00:05:12,045
No, I want to tell you why

97
00:05:12,045 --> 00:05:13,146
I came over in the first place.

98
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,748
Okay, tell.

99
00:05:14,748 --> 00:05:16,750
Well, "ask" really.

100
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:18,118
Are you doing anything tonight?

101
00:05:18,118 --> 00:05:19,152
Several things is more

102
00:05:19,152 --> 00:05:20,387
like it.

103
00:05:20,387 --> 00:05:21,421
I'm spending a few hours at the

104
00:05:21,421 --> 00:05:22,689
animal shelter.

105
00:05:22,689 --> 00:05:24,157
And then I'm spying on another

106
00:05:24,157 --> 00:05:25,492
bookstore to see what their book

107
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:26,760
signings are like.

108
00:05:26,760 --> 00:05:28,161
Okay, just chalk it up

109
00:05:28,161 --> 00:05:31,097
to another lost opportunity.

110
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:32,766
Let me guess.

111
00:05:32,766 --> 00:05:34,134
Another last minute fix-up and

112
00:05:34,134 --> 00:05:35,569
this time he's really

113
00:05:35,569 --> 00:05:36,636
Mister Perfect.

114
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,438
Well, no, he's not, but I did

115
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,173
mention to him that you were,

116
00:05:40,173 --> 00:05:42,776
and that you might be at dinner.

117
00:05:42,776 --> 00:05:44,477
Sorry, thanks anyway.

118
00:05:44,477 --> 00:05:46,613
Good luck.

119
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,484
Look down inside and tell me

120
00:05:51,484 --> 00:05:54,421
if you see anything.

121
00:05:57,891 --> 00:06:00,594
You see anything?

122
00:06:02,529 --> 00:06:03,964
What's going on?

123
00:06:05,465 --> 00:06:08,969
Now?

124
00:06:08,969 --> 00:06:11,638
(laughing)

125
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:15,041
Oh!

126
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:23,450
Ow!

127
00:06:24,684 --> 00:06:26,019
Are you all right?

128
00:06:26,019 --> 00:06:27,520
Yes.

129
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:28,755
What happened?

130
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:29,856
He's accident-prone.

131
00:06:29,856 --> 00:06:30,991
Bill, turn off the water.

132
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:32,592
Steve.

133
00:06:34,461 --> 00:06:36,997
Get back to work.

134
00:06:40,467 --> 00:06:42,636
I'm really sorry.

135
00:06:42,636 --> 00:06:45,772
I could do something to fix it.

136
00:06:45,772 --> 00:06:46,873
I know how,

137
00:06:46,873 --> 00:06:48,141
and I could if you wanted.

138
00:06:48,141 --> 00:06:50,010
Go on, I'll work it out.

139
00:06:50,010 --> 00:06:52,045
Hey, we know you didn't do it

140
00:06:52,045 --> 00:06:53,913
on purpose, huh?

141
00:06:53,913 --> 00:06:55,482
It's okay.

142
00:06:55,482 --> 00:06:57,484
Go on, that's a good guy.

143
00:06:58,485 --> 00:06:59,819
How in the world did that

144
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:02,756
happen?

145
00:07:02,756 --> 00:07:03,790
Have your gardener replace

146
00:07:03,790 --> 00:07:05,492
the plants and you, uh,

147
00:07:05,492 --> 00:07:07,160
send me the bill.

148
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,129
Thank you.

149
00:07:09,129 --> 00:07:11,164
I don't have a gardener.

150
00:07:11,164 --> 00:07:13,066
He quit last week.

151
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:15,535
Something about hay fever.

152
00:07:15,535 --> 00:07:16,736
Just tell me what to order

153
00:07:16,736 --> 00:07:18,705
and I'll find somebody.

154
00:07:18,705 --> 00:07:20,940
Well, let's see: foxgloves,

155
00:07:20,940 --> 00:07:23,610
impatiens, marigolds...

156
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:26,112
Dale's azalea.

157
00:07:26,112 --> 00:07:29,582
What about your worker?

158
00:07:29,582 --> 00:07:30,884
Which worker?

159
00:07:30,884 --> 00:07:32,252
The one who did it.

160
00:07:32,252 --> 00:07:34,621
You mean to fix it up?

161
00:07:34,621 --> 00:07:36,256
Well, he said he could.

162
00:07:36,256 --> 00:07:39,592
That, uh, young man, uh,

163
00:07:39,592 --> 00:07:41,194
he's a few cans short

164
00:07:41,194 --> 00:07:42,262
of a six-pack,

165
00:07:42,262 --> 00:07:43,663
if you know what I mean.

166
00:07:43,663 --> 00:07:44,731
I don't care if he has two

167
00:07:44,731 --> 00:07:45,865
heads as long as he can do

168
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:46,900
the work.

169
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,034
Is there a possibility he knows

170
00:07:48,034 --> 00:07:49,169
something about gardening?

171
00:07:49,169 --> 00:07:50,303
His old man's a retired

172
00:07:50,303 --> 00:07:51,538
landscaper.

173
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:54,040
We go back a ways.

174
00:07:54,040 --> 00:07:57,143
Tell me what you want him to do.

175
00:08:02,048 --> 00:08:03,316
This guy has played tricks

176
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,051
on you before, right?

177
00:08:05,051 --> 00:08:06,686
He plays lot of tricks on me.

178
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:07,854
All right, so you should have

179
00:08:07,854 --> 00:08:09,322
been on your guard against him,

180
00:08:09,322 --> 00:08:10,724
right?

181
00:08:10,724 --> 00:08:11,758
I should have been on my

182
00:08:11,758 --> 00:08:12,859
guard with him, that's for sure.

183
00:08:12,859 --> 00:08:13,993
Okay, now.

184
00:08:13,993 --> 00:08:15,762
The next time, this same guy

185
00:08:15,762 --> 00:08:17,097
asks you to do something for

186
00:08:17,097 --> 00:08:18,965
him, what's the first thing

187
00:08:18,965 --> 00:08:20,133
that's going to pop up in your

188
00:08:20,133 --> 00:08:22,135
mind, huh?

189
00:08:23,136 --> 00:08:25,038
The first thing, the first

190
00:08:25,038 --> 00:08:28,241
thing... that's going to pop up

191
00:08:28,241 --> 00:08:30,243
in your mind is "This guy plays

192
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,078
tricks on me.

193
00:08:32,078 --> 00:08:33,213
Maybe he doesn't really want me

194
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:34,247
to do something for him at all.

195
00:08:34,247 --> 00:08:35,315
Maybe he just wants

196
00:08:35,315 --> 00:08:37,684
to play a trick."

197
00:08:37,684 --> 00:08:38,818
I'm never going to fix

198
00:08:38,818 --> 00:08:39,853
the hose for him anymore.

199
00:08:39,853 --> 00:08:41,955
You're damn right you're not.

200
00:08:41,955 --> 00:08:43,123
You're never going to do

201
00:08:43,123 --> 00:08:44,190
anything for him anymore 'cause

202
00:08:44,190 --> 00:08:45,225
he can't be trusted.

203
00:08:45,225 --> 00:08:46,292
That's for sure.

204
00:08:46,292 --> 00:08:48,661
Good boy.

205
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,163
Except I might do something

206
00:08:50,163 --> 00:08:51,664
for him sometimes because

207
00:08:51,664 --> 00:08:53,867
he's a pretty nice guy.

208
00:08:59,873 --> 00:09:01,074
Go tell your sister and

209
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:03,209
Steven to wash up for supper.

210
00:09:08,214 --> 00:09:09,382
What would you say if I asked

211
00:09:09,382 --> 00:09:12,118
you to marry me?

212
00:09:12,118 --> 00:09:13,386
(chuckling)

213
00:09:13,386 --> 00:09:15,855
If you asked me to marry you?

214
00:09:15,855 --> 00:09:17,157
I'm conducting the Justine

215
00:09:17,157 --> 00:09:21,628
Melville preliminary survey.

216
00:09:21,628 --> 00:09:24,330
(laughing)

217
00:09:24,330 --> 00:09:26,065
Oh, oh.

218
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:39,145
Mom says it's time to wash up

219
00:09:39,145 --> 00:09:40,180
for supper.

220
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:41,214
(gasping)

221
00:09:41,214 --> 00:09:42,816
Tim, don't ever do that!

222
00:09:42,816 --> 00:09:43,917
Mom told me to.

223
00:09:43,917 --> 00:09:46,052
(laughing)

224
00:09:46,052 --> 00:09:47,720
No, I know, but what I mean

225
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:50,290
is, um, don't, uh, sneak up on

226
00:09:50,290 --> 00:09:51,825
people, especially when they're

227
00:09:51,825 --> 00:09:53,993
together.

228
00:09:53,993 --> 00:09:55,061
Alone.

229
00:09:55,061 --> 00:09:56,396
Let them know you're there

230
00:09:56,396 --> 00:09:57,831
by knocking on the door and

231
00:09:57,831 --> 00:09:59,732
saying, "Excuse me."

232
00:10:01,301 --> 00:10:02,936
Excuse me.

233
00:10:03,937 --> 00:10:05,004
Hey, guess who I ran into

234
00:10:05,004 --> 00:10:07,907
downtown this afternoon?

235
00:10:07,907 --> 00:10:09,142
Hank Pearn.

236
00:10:09,142 --> 00:10:10,176
Hank? Mm-hmm.

237
00:10:10,176 --> 00:10:11,311
That lived across the street

238
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:12,412
from us when the kids were

239
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,147
little? Same guy.

240
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:15,215
Oh, for heaven's sake.

241
00:10:15,215 --> 00:10:17,951
Heavier, same frizzy hair,

242
00:10:17,951 --> 00:10:20,286
only less of it.

243
00:10:20,286 --> 00:10:21,387
I told him Justine was

244
00:10:21,387 --> 00:10:22,989
practically a judge now.

245
00:10:22,989 --> 00:10:24,090
Dad, that would make me the

246
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:25,191
only person in history

247
00:10:25,191 --> 00:10:26,259
to graduate law school

248
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:27,894
and go directly to the bench.

249
00:10:27,894 --> 00:10:28,962
He asked me if I was talking

250
00:10:28,962 --> 00:10:29,996
about the little kid with the

251
00:10:29,996 --> 00:10:31,097
two front teeth missing.

252
00:10:31,097 --> 00:10:32,198
Dad!

253
00:10:32,198 --> 00:10:33,233
(chuckling)

254
00:10:33,233 --> 00:10:34,434
Steven, you've hardly eaten.

255
00:10:34,434 --> 00:10:36,135
Are you sick?

256
00:10:36,135 --> 00:10:38,738
No, no...

257
00:10:38,738 --> 00:10:41,040
Um...

258
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:43,776
I'm just a little nervous.

259
00:10:47,814 --> 00:10:49,282
Okay, um, there's something

260
00:10:49,282 --> 00:10:52,018
I have to do, and...

261
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:53,052
I guess I'd better get it

262
00:10:53,052 --> 00:10:55,021
over with.

263
00:11:03,897 --> 00:11:05,798
(chuckling)

264
00:11:05,798 --> 00:11:08,835
Justine, with your family

265
00:11:08,835 --> 00:11:11,104
as my witness,

266
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:12,872
I'm kneeling on your kitchen

267
00:11:12,872 --> 00:11:15,775
floor, which is murder on my

268
00:11:15,775 --> 00:11:19,512
right patella,

269
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:26,886
to ask you to be my wife.

270
00:11:26,886 --> 00:11:28,521
It's a ring.

271
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:30,890
(chuckling)

272
00:11:30,890 --> 00:11:32,158
So if it so pleases the

273
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:35,795
Court, the plaintiff...

274
00:11:35,795 --> 00:11:37,397
(chuckling)

275
00:11:37,397 --> 00:11:38,464
requests an answer

276
00:11:38,464 --> 00:11:41,501
of "yes" or "no".

277
00:11:41,501 --> 00:11:44,904
Your Honor?

278
00:11:44,904 --> 00:11:46,306
Honey?

279
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:49,475
Yes, yes.

280
00:11:49,475 --> 00:11:50,810
(laughing)

281
00:11:50,810 --> 00:11:52,145
Oh, that's great.

282
00:11:54,214 --> 00:11:55,381
Congratulations.

283
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,550
Congratulations, darling.

284
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:58,918
That's wonderful.

285
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:04,357
Come here.

286
00:12:04,357 --> 00:12:06,392
I'm getting married, Timmy.

287
00:12:06,392 --> 00:12:09,195
I thought that's what it was.

288
00:12:09,195 --> 00:12:11,030
Come here, give me a hug.

289
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:12,065
(all laughing)

290
00:12:24,043 --> 00:12:26,346
(light knocking on door)

291
00:12:28,881 --> 00:12:31,884
I'm not sleepy.

292
00:12:31,884 --> 00:12:36,322
Mom: Any idea why?

293
00:12:36,322 --> 00:12:38,157
Is Justine going away?

294
00:12:38,157 --> 00:12:39,258
You mean when she marries

295
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:40,360
Steven?

296
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:42,195
Uh-huh.

297
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:43,830
Yes.

298
00:12:43,830 --> 00:12:44,864
She and Steven will live

299
00:12:44,864 --> 00:12:47,066
together.

300
00:12:47,066 --> 00:12:48,134
Will she come back like when

301
00:12:48,134 --> 00:12:50,236
she came back from college?

302
00:12:50,236 --> 00:12:52,138
She'll come back to visit,

303
00:12:52,138 --> 00:12:55,842
but she won't live here again.

304
00:12:55,842 --> 00:12:56,976
Will she still be my little

305
00:12:56,976 --> 00:12:58,511
sister?

306
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:01,147
Forever and always.

307
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,348
But I'm going to have a life

308
00:13:02,348 --> 00:13:03,883
with Steven now, Timmy.

309
00:13:03,883 --> 00:13:05,018
We're going to have our

310
00:13:05,018 --> 00:13:07,053
own home together.

311
00:13:07,053 --> 00:13:08,121
Someday we'll even

312
00:13:08,121 --> 00:13:09,889
have children.

313
00:13:09,889 --> 00:13:11,291
Everything that's the end

314
00:13:11,291 --> 00:13:12,458
of one thing, Tim, is the

315
00:13:12,458 --> 00:13:14,494
beginning of something else.

316
00:13:14,494 --> 00:13:17,130
Ant that makes this happy and

317
00:13:17,130 --> 00:13:18,865
sad at the same time.

318
00:13:21,167 --> 00:13:22,301
Why can't Steven come

319
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:23,870
live here?

320
00:13:23,870 --> 00:13:25,071
He's leaving his family, too

321
00:13:25,071 --> 00:13:26,339
to be with me.

322
00:13:26,339 --> 00:13:27,540
That's what you do

323
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,242
when you grow up.

324
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:31,444
I want you to live with me.

325
00:13:31,444 --> 00:13:32,512
We'll live together again

326
00:13:32,512 --> 00:13:33,579
someday, Timmy.

327
00:13:33,579 --> 00:13:37,183
When?

328
00:13:37,183 --> 00:13:38,484
You know, my brother missed

329
00:13:38,484 --> 00:13:40,153
me when I left home to marry

330
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:42,655
your dad.

331
00:13:42,655 --> 00:13:44,524
But if I hadn't married him,

332
00:13:44,524 --> 00:13:46,659
I wouldn't have you two angels,

333
00:13:46,659 --> 00:13:49,629
would I?

334
00:13:49,629 --> 00:13:51,931
Sometimes I'm not an angel.

335
00:13:51,931 --> 00:13:53,399
No...

336
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,102
(chuckling)

337
00:13:57,537 --> 00:13:59,472
It's time for sleep.

338
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:02,542
Okay, I guess you can marry

339
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:04,210
Steven.

340
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:05,645
Thanks, big brother.

341
00:14:05,645 --> 00:14:06,913
Now that I have your permission,

342
00:14:06,913 --> 00:14:09,282
I will.

343
00:14:09,282 --> 00:14:10,950
Good night.

344
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:18,057
(meowing)

345
00:14:18,057 --> 00:14:19,459
You know, as long as I have

346
00:14:19,459 --> 00:14:20,626
to get up every four hours to

347
00:14:20,626 --> 00:14:21,694
dole this stuff out, the least

348
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,929
you could do is to have

349
00:14:22,929 --> 00:14:24,230
a good attitude.

350
00:14:24,230 --> 00:14:28,968
Come on, come on.

351
00:14:28,968 --> 00:14:30,636
Good.

352
00:14:30,636 --> 00:14:32,138
(meowing)

353
00:14:32,138 --> 00:14:34,373
All right, that's it.

354
00:14:34,373 --> 00:14:39,145
Cats.

355
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:40,546
(meowing)

356
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:41,714
They ought to make tuna-flavored

357
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:44,317
medicine for cats.

358
00:14:47,453 --> 00:14:50,490
Remember, it's Saturday.

359
00:14:50,490 --> 00:14:52,091
It's the day we sleep in.

360
00:14:52,091 --> 00:14:54,560
(dog whimpering)

361
00:14:59,398 --> 00:15:02,435
(lawn mower powering up)

362
00:15:02,435 --> 00:15:05,605
(motor revving loudly)

363
00:15:19,452 --> 00:15:21,587
(dog barking)

364
00:15:29,061 --> 00:15:30,563
Excuse me.

365
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:31,731
Excuse me.

366
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:33,666
What do you think you're doing?

367
00:15:33,666 --> 00:15:35,001
That must be a trick

368
00:15:35,001 --> 00:15:36,068
question.

369
00:15:36,068 --> 00:15:37,136
No, it's not a trick

370
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,204
question, I just wanna know.

371
00:15:38,204 --> 00:15:39,338
What exactly do you think

372
00:15:39,338 --> 00:15:40,573
you're doing?

373
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:43,276
Cutting the grass.

374
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,746
Well, would you stop, please?

375
00:15:46,746 --> 00:15:48,481
Would you stop?

376
00:15:48,481 --> 00:15:49,782
I'd like...

377
00:15:49,782 --> 00:15:53,085
Stop!

378
00:15:53,085 --> 00:15:54,520
Do you have any idea how

379
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,057
inappropriate it is to just

380
00:15:58,057 --> 00:15:59,625
march into someone's garage

381
00:15:59,625 --> 00:16:02,028
without permission and create

382
00:16:02,028 --> 00:16:04,163
ear-splitting pandemonium,

383
00:16:04,163 --> 00:16:05,598
mowing a lawn nobody asked you

384
00:16:05,598 --> 00:16:07,033
to mow in the first place

385
00:16:07,033 --> 00:16:09,669
at 6:00-- What?

386
00:16:09,669 --> 00:16:11,737
It's yellow.

387
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,576
It's cat medicine.

388
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:17,710
You have a sick cat?

389
00:16:17,710 --> 00:16:20,479
No, I'm a volunteer

390
00:16:20,479 --> 00:16:22,181
at the shelter.

391
00:16:22,181 --> 00:16:23,349
Some cats needed medicating

392
00:16:23,349 --> 00:16:24,383
through the night,

393
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,752
so I took them home.

394
00:16:29,522 --> 00:16:31,791
I fixed the flowers.

395
00:16:31,791 --> 00:16:34,060
Thank you.

396
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,629
You want to see?

397
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:37,997
Okay.

398
00:16:47,540 --> 00:16:48,641
It's perfect.

399
00:16:48,641 --> 00:16:49,742
How long have you been here?

400
00:16:49,742 --> 00:16:51,177
Few hours.

401
00:16:51,177 --> 00:16:53,779
I like to see the sun come up.

402
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:55,214
Did you ever think that if you

403
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,549
got up after sunrise, that you

404
00:16:56,549 --> 00:16:58,084
could've slept for two days and

405
00:16:58,084 --> 00:16:59,585
skipped a whole day in between

406
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:02,121
and you'd never know?

407
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:04,323
No, I never thought that.

408
00:17:04,323 --> 00:17:05,391
I don't want to skip

409
00:17:05,391 --> 00:17:07,260
any days, that's for sure.

410
00:17:07,260 --> 00:17:09,462
No, I don't either.

411
00:17:09,462 --> 00:17:11,197
I weeded and fed the flowers

412
00:17:11,197 --> 00:17:12,331
and I turned the compost

413
00:17:12,331 --> 00:17:13,366
in the back.

414
00:17:13,366 --> 00:17:14,433
That was very thoughtful.

415
00:17:14,433 --> 00:17:15,468
Thank you.

416
00:17:15,468 --> 00:17:16,536
I'll pay you for any

417
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:17,603
extra work you've done.

418
00:17:17,603 --> 00:17:18,638
Oh, no, you won't.

419
00:17:18,638 --> 00:17:19,739
I broke the flowers

420
00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:21,307
'cause I wasn't on my guard.

421
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:22,575
My dad says you have to take

422
00:17:22,575 --> 00:17:25,111
responsibility for your actions.

423
00:17:25,111 --> 00:17:26,679
He says "Do more than people

424
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,481
expect," "Always mind your

425
00:17:28,481 --> 00:17:29,849
P's' and Q's" and "Never

426
00:17:29,849 --> 00:17:31,684
take 'no' for an answer."

427
00:17:31,684 --> 00:17:33,152
Your father has a lot to say.

428
00:17:33,152 --> 00:17:35,588
That's for sure.

429
00:17:35,588 --> 00:17:36,656
You can put the mower

430
00:17:36,656 --> 00:17:37,723
away now.

431
00:17:37,723 --> 00:17:39,458
Sorry, no can do.

432
00:17:39,458 --> 00:17:41,527
I've got to finish the job.

433
00:17:41,527 --> 00:17:42,628
You've got to finish the jobs

434
00:17:42,628 --> 00:17:43,763
you start.

435
00:17:43,763 --> 00:17:44,797
Your dad said that?

436
00:17:44,797 --> 00:17:46,132
My dad says that.

437
00:17:46,132 --> 00:17:47,500
He says a garden is like

438
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,635
the person who grows it,

439
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:52,471
and yours is pretty happy,

440
00:17:52,471 --> 00:17:54,473
but it could be more

441
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:57,343
taken care of.

442
00:18:00,479 --> 00:18:01,714
What's your name?

443
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,716
Tim.

444
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:08,154
I'm Mary, Mary Horton.

445
00:18:08,154 --> 00:18:10,256
Tim, how would you like a job?

446
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:13,225
Well, I've got a job.

447
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:15,361
No, I mean, on Saturdays.

448
00:18:15,361 --> 00:18:19,265
Taking care of my garden.

449
00:18:19,265 --> 00:18:20,700
Sure.

450
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:22,902
I'd like that a lot.

451
00:18:22,902 --> 00:18:24,704
Okay then, Saturdays.

452
00:18:24,704 --> 00:18:26,405
But not before 9:00.

453
00:18:26,405 --> 00:18:27,506
Not before 9:00,

454
00:18:27,506 --> 00:18:29,275
that's for sure.

455
00:18:30,576 --> 00:18:33,546
Mary Mary Horton?

456
00:18:33,546 --> 00:18:36,482
You're a very nice person.

457
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:38,351
It's, it's just one "Mary".

458
00:18:38,351 --> 00:18:39,585
Thank you.

459
00:18:39,585 --> 00:18:42,455
You're a very nice person, too.

460
00:18:42,455 --> 00:18:44,590
Yes, I am.

461
00:19:44,016 --> 00:19:45,785
Good morning, Forbsie.

462
00:19:45,785 --> 00:19:46,886
It might be good, if it

463
00:19:46,886 --> 00:19:48,988
weren't for the damn cicadas.

464
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:50,256
I don't know how they can hear

465
00:19:50,256 --> 00:19:51,691
themselves think.

466
00:19:51,691 --> 00:19:52,925
Well, the way I understand

467
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:54,560
it, cicadae don't have brains or

468
00:19:54,560 --> 00:19:56,529
ears, so as far as they're

469
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:57,730
concerned, it's just good

470
00:19:57,730 --> 00:19:59,732
vibrations.

471
00:19:59,732 --> 00:20:00,933
Anything happening I should

472
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:01,967
know about?

473
00:20:01,967 --> 00:20:03,002
Oh, your travel agent

474
00:20:03,002 --> 00:20:04,036
left a packet by the door.

475
00:20:04,036 --> 00:20:05,571
It's under the counter.

476
00:20:05,571 --> 00:20:06,605
Where are you off to

477
00:20:06,605 --> 00:20:07,840
this year?

478
00:20:07,840 --> 00:20:09,508
Well, I don't know.

479
00:20:09,508 --> 00:20:11,410
Someplace quiet.

480
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:14,346
Bali, I think.

481
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:15,548
It's the rainy season there.

482
00:20:15,548 --> 00:20:17,383
You better bring a good book,

483
00:20:17,383 --> 00:20:19,919
if you can find one.

484
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:21,654
So, what's the scoop

485
00:20:21,654 --> 00:20:22,755
about tonight?

486
00:20:22,755 --> 00:20:24,490
I got the coffee, and, uh,

487
00:20:24,490 --> 00:20:25,591
the rental place will deliver

488
00:20:25,591 --> 00:20:27,493
the chairs by 3:00, and the

489
00:20:27,493 --> 00:20:28,761
bakery called to say the

490
00:20:28,761 --> 00:20:31,630
pastries will be here at 11:00.

491
00:20:31,630 --> 00:20:32,698
You know when I was

492
00:20:32,698 --> 00:20:33,933
spying at "Pages" the other

493
00:20:33,933 --> 00:20:35,301
night, they were handing out

494
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:36,335
free bookmarks.

495
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:37,503
We don't have bookmarks.

496
00:20:37,503 --> 00:20:38,537
Well, I have to go to

497
00:20:38,537 --> 00:20:39,572
the nursery later, I could pick

498
00:20:39,572 --> 00:20:41,340
some up on my way.

499
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:42,374
You haven't found

500
00:20:42,374 --> 00:20:43,742
a gardener yet?

501
00:20:43,742 --> 00:20:46,579
Actually, I think I have.

502
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:47,613
Why can't he go to

503
00:20:47,613 --> 00:20:49,849
the nursery?

504
00:20:49,849 --> 00:20:52,418
I'm not sure he drives.

505
00:20:52,418 --> 00:20:54,353
Oh, you hired a kid?

506
00:20:54,353 --> 00:20:56,555
No, a man.

507
00:20:56,555 --> 00:20:58,357
Apparently with some

508
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:00,693
limitations.

509
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:02,761
How unusual.

510
00:21:02,761 --> 00:21:03,996
Can he garden?

511
00:21:03,996 --> 00:21:05,097
He can most definitely

512
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:08,601
garden.

513
00:21:08,601 --> 00:21:11,103
And he's charming.

514
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,371
"Charming" is important

515
00:21:12,371 --> 00:21:13,439
in a gardener.

516
00:21:13,439 --> 00:21:14,607
At least Lady Chatterley

517
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,041
thought so.

518
00:21:20,079 --> 00:21:24,650
(chatter)

519
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:26,752
Ah, one for the champ.

520
00:21:26,752 --> 00:21:27,787
There you go.

521
00:21:27,787 --> 00:21:28,821
Hey, Ron.

522
00:21:28,821 --> 00:21:30,422
Hey, Ed, how you doing?

523
00:21:30,422 --> 00:21:31,457
How you doing buddy?

524
00:21:31,457 --> 00:21:32,591
Good.

525
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:33,759
Still doing construction?

526
00:21:33,759 --> 00:21:35,060
Yup, and I got a new job,

527
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:36,095
too.

528
00:21:36,095 --> 00:21:37,363
Oh, yeah?

529
00:21:37,363 --> 00:21:38,497
I'm going to be a gardener

530
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:39,532
for the lady next door

531
00:21:39,532 --> 00:21:41,367
to my other job.

532
00:21:41,367 --> 00:21:42,434
I could use a little

533
00:21:42,434 --> 00:21:43,702
work myself.

534
00:21:43,702 --> 00:21:45,404
Tell me your secret.

535
00:21:45,404 --> 00:21:47,439
I fell into the lady's bed.

536
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:51,443
(all laughing)

537
00:21:52,645 --> 00:21:53,679
Come on, knock it off,

538
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:54,713
will you?

539
00:21:54,713 --> 00:21:55,881
Get your minds out

540
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:56,949
of the gutter.

541
00:21:56,949 --> 00:21:58,083
He had an accident and fell

542
00:21:58,083 --> 00:21:59,552
into the lady's flower bed.

543
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:01,720
Yeah, right.

544
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:04,456
My boy don't think that way.

545
00:22:06,525 --> 00:22:08,627
Take another look, Ron.

546
00:22:08,627 --> 00:22:09,728
And remember.

547
00:22:09,728 --> 00:22:11,797
Boys will be boys.

548
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:14,333
(laughing)

549
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,635
(applause)

550
00:22:21,640 --> 00:22:22,875
Thank you all very much

551
00:22:22,875 --> 00:22:23,909
for joining us.

552
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:25,611
Um, in a few minutes, our

553
00:22:25,611 --> 00:22:26,946
esteemed guest will be ready to

554
00:22:26,946 --> 00:22:28,881
sign your books and, in the

555
00:22:28,881 --> 00:22:30,416
meantime, we have refreshments

556
00:22:30,416 --> 00:22:31,483
for you.

557
00:22:31,483 --> 00:22:33,552
(applause)

558
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,191
Terrific, really terrific.

559
00:22:39,191 --> 00:22:40,426
Thanks.

560
00:22:40,426 --> 00:22:41,994
Mary, it was great.

561
00:22:41,994 --> 00:22:43,028
I may have mentioned Joel to

562
00:22:43,028 --> 00:22:44,063
you, Mary.

563
00:22:44,063 --> 00:22:45,497
David's old college friend?

564
00:22:45,497 --> 00:22:46,599
Uh, David's former college

565
00:22:46,599 --> 00:22:47,700
friend, if you don't mind.

566
00:22:47,700 --> 00:22:48,767
(chuckling)

567
00:22:48,767 --> 00:22:50,169
Well, anyway, Mary Horton,

568
00:22:50,169 --> 00:22:51,470
Joel Shore.

569
00:22:51,470 --> 00:22:52,504
Hello.

570
00:22:52,504 --> 00:22:53,639
How do you do?

571
00:22:53,639 --> 00:22:54,773
Your program was nicely done.

572
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:55,808
Thank you.

573
00:22:55,808 --> 00:22:56,842
As a matter of fact, I do

574
00:22:56,842 --> 00:22:58,110
freelance consulting for event

575
00:22:58,110 --> 00:22:59,645
packaging, so if you're

576
00:22:59,645 --> 00:23:01,080
interested, uh, there may be

577
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:02,114
some ways of making these

578
00:23:02,114 --> 00:23:03,482
evenings of yours even more

579
00:23:03,482 --> 00:23:04,583
successful than they

580
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:05,651
already are.

581
00:23:05,651 --> 00:23:07,953
We're, uh, going for a drink.

582
00:23:07,953 --> 00:23:09,622
Why don't you join us and take

583
00:23:09,622 --> 00:23:13,726
advantage of some free advice?

584
00:23:13,726 --> 00:23:15,494
Sounds great, but I really

585
00:23:15,494 --> 00:23:16,795
should stay here.

586
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:19,565
Maybe another time?

587
00:23:19,565 --> 00:23:21,767
Absolutely, another time.

588
00:23:21,767 --> 00:23:23,969
Nice having met you.

589
00:23:23,969 --> 00:23:25,704
Joel.

590
00:23:29,642 --> 00:23:30,676
You didn't even give

591
00:23:30,676 --> 00:23:31,777
him a chance.

592
00:23:31,777 --> 00:23:33,045
He could've been Mr. Right.

593
00:23:33,045 --> 00:23:34,079
He could only have been

594
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:35,214
Mr. Right Now.

595
00:23:35,214 --> 00:23:36,248
Dale, there's no such thing

596
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:38,484
as Mr. Right.

597
00:23:38,484 --> 00:23:40,719
Right.

598
00:23:50,596 --> 00:23:51,964
Do your best.

599
00:23:51,964 --> 00:23:53,832
Always.

600
00:23:57,603 --> 00:23:58,837
Thanks, Dad.

601
00:24:03,275 --> 00:24:04,510
Son!

602
00:24:08,614 --> 00:24:11,884
Remember, be a gentleman.

603
00:24:25,130 --> 00:24:26,598
So, you know how to

604
00:24:26,598 --> 00:24:28,600
prepare a plot for planting.

605
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:29,668
I know how to do that,

606
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:30,970
that's for sure.

607
00:24:30,970 --> 00:24:33,605
Okay, well, um, everything

608
00:24:33,605 --> 00:24:35,307
you'll need is here.

609
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:37,643
I've made a, a planting plan.

610
00:24:37,643 --> 00:24:38,911
It shows where I want all the

611
00:24:38,911 --> 00:24:42,848
various crops to be, um...

612
00:24:42,848 --> 00:24:45,951
For example, the, uh, shelling

613
00:24:45,951 --> 00:24:48,821
peas go there, and the snap peas

614
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:52,257
go over here, and, um,

615
00:24:52,257 --> 00:24:54,093
so on and so on.

616
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:56,228
Does that make sense to you?

617
00:24:56,228 --> 00:24:57,763
I've planted vegetables

618
00:24:57,763 --> 00:24:59,198
lots of times.

619
00:24:59,198 --> 00:25:00,232
Okay, well, let me know

620
00:25:00,232 --> 00:25:01,567
if you need anything?

621
00:25:01,567 --> 00:25:03,268
Okay.

622
00:25:21,787 --> 00:25:25,691
(sound of digging continues)

623
00:26:11,036 --> 00:26:13,772
Excuse me.

624
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:14,940
I didn't knock on the door

625
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:15,974
because there isn't any,

626
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:18,343
but I said "Excuse me."

627
00:26:18,343 --> 00:26:20,012
So, you're finished then?

628
00:26:20,012 --> 00:26:21,914
Easy as pie.

629
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:23,048
Well, now I know there's at

630
00:26:23,048 --> 00:26:24,149
least one other person on the

631
00:26:24,149 --> 00:26:28,087
planet who can read my writing.

632
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:29,988
I didn't need the plan.

633
00:26:31,990 --> 00:26:33,225
But I asked you to use

634
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:34,960
the plan for a reason.

635
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:36,795
I like to rotate my crops.

636
00:26:36,795 --> 00:26:38,030
I did.

637
00:26:38,030 --> 00:26:39,064
I rotated them.

638
00:26:39,064 --> 00:26:40,098
How could you have

639
00:26:40,098 --> 00:26:41,433
without the plan?

640
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:42,801
I can tell where you planted

641
00:26:42,801 --> 00:26:43,869
things last year by the old

642
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:45,804
leaves and vines on the ground.

643
00:26:45,804 --> 00:26:47,072
That's certainly a special

644
00:26:47,072 --> 00:26:49,074
gift, but...

645
00:26:49,074 --> 00:26:50,108
Do you by any chance wear

646
00:26:50,108 --> 00:26:52,411
glasses?

647
00:26:52,411 --> 00:26:54,780
No.

648
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:58,350
Tim...

649
00:26:59,918 --> 00:27:02,020
Can you read?

650
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,391
Are you going to have

651
00:27:06,391 --> 00:27:10,028
to let me go?

652
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:12,464
The thing is,

653
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:13,999
I may not always be here

654
00:27:13,999 --> 00:27:16,335
when you come to garden.

655
00:27:16,335 --> 00:27:18,070
In fact, I'm going away

656
00:27:18,070 --> 00:27:20,172
in a few weeks, I...

657
00:27:20,172 --> 00:27:21,473
I'd hoped I'd be able to leave

658
00:27:21,473 --> 00:27:22,341
you instructions.

659
00:27:22,341 --> 00:27:24,476
(cicadae chirping loudly)

660
00:27:24,476 --> 00:27:26,211
(sighing)

661
00:27:26,211 --> 00:27:28,881
They give me such a headache.

662
00:27:49,268 --> 00:27:52,037
(chirping stops)

663
00:27:52,037 --> 00:27:53,972
How did you do that?

664
00:27:53,972 --> 00:27:56,742
He's the choirmaster.

665
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:57,943
When you stop him from singing,

666
00:27:57,943 --> 00:28:00,212
they all stop.

667
00:28:00,212 --> 00:28:01,246
How did you know where

668
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:02,414
to find him?

669
00:28:02,414 --> 00:28:04,049
His voice is different.

670
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:07,019
I can hear him.

671
00:28:07,019 --> 00:28:09,087
I can't.

672
00:28:10,389 --> 00:28:14,126
I can't really read.

673
00:28:14,126 --> 00:28:15,827
Have you ever tried to learn?

674
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:16,929
Once.

675
00:28:16,929 --> 00:28:19,064
It's real hard.

676
00:28:21,466 --> 00:28:22,868
You don't want to get

677
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:27,139
rid of him, do you?

678
00:28:27,139 --> 00:28:29,374
No.

679
00:28:29,374 --> 00:28:30,509
He just does

680
00:28:30,509 --> 00:28:32,778
what he's made to do.

681
00:28:39,418 --> 00:28:41,353
(chirping begins again)

682
00:28:41,353 --> 00:28:45,023
I own a bookstore.

683
00:28:45,023 --> 00:28:46,258
I bet you a nickel

684
00:28:46,258 --> 00:28:47,492
I could pick out some

685
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:49,494
stories you'd like.

686
00:28:49,494 --> 00:28:51,964
Probably.

687
00:28:51,964 --> 00:28:52,998
Or I could teach you

688
00:28:52,998 --> 00:28:54,967
how to read.

689
00:28:54,967 --> 00:28:56,001
No.

690
00:28:56,001 --> 00:28:58,437
Why?

691
00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:00,806
Well, it would be bad if I..

692
00:29:00,806 --> 00:29:02,174
If what?

693
00:29:02,174 --> 00:29:04,843
If, if it were hard or,

694
00:29:04,843 --> 00:29:07,446
or if it took time?

695
00:29:07,446 --> 00:29:09,548
If I couldn't do it.

696
00:29:09,548 --> 00:29:11,917
That'd feel bad.

697
00:29:11,917 --> 00:29:13,085
Well, and I don't know

698
00:29:13,085 --> 00:29:14,453
absolutely that I could teach

699
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:19,091
you, but still, we could try.

700
00:29:23,562 --> 00:29:24,963
I really like you, Mary

701
00:29:24,963 --> 00:29:26,932
Horton, that's for sure.

702
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:31,436
And you like me too.

703
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:47,386
(reading haltingly) "Frog... ran

704
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:53,358
up... the... path...

705
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:59,598
to... Toad's...

706
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:00,832
house.

707
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:05,637
He...

708
00:30:05,637 --> 00:30:07,539
kan-nocked..."

709
00:30:07,539 --> 00:30:09,274
The "K" is silent.

710
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:10,509
She's just keeping the "N"

711
00:30:10,509 --> 00:30:11,910
company while he does the

712
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:15,947
talking, so it's...

713
00:30:15,947 --> 00:30:19,618
"He...

714
00:30:19,618 --> 00:30:23,555
knocked...

715
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:27,192
on... the...

716
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:31,129
front... door."

717
00:30:31,129 --> 00:30:32,898
That's it.

718
00:30:32,898 --> 00:30:36,435
"There was no answer."

719
00:30:36,435 --> 00:30:39,404
"'Toad, Toad,'

720
00:30:39,404 --> 00:30:45,010
shouted... Frog.

721
00:30:45,010 --> 00:30:48,413
'Wake up.

722
00:30:48,413 --> 00:30:54,553
It is spring.'"

723
00:30:56,421 --> 00:30:58,056
"'Blah,' said a voice from

724
00:30:58,056 --> 00:30:59,257
inside the house."

725
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:00,425
(chuckling)

726
00:31:00,425 --> 00:31:01,693
Read that part again.

727
00:31:01,693 --> 00:31:03,195
"'Blah,' said a voice from

728
00:31:03,195 --> 00:31:04,329
inside the house."

729
00:31:04,329 --> 00:31:05,964
(laughing)

730
00:31:05,964 --> 00:31:07,999
All right, your homework

731
00:31:07,999 --> 00:31:10,135
is to work on this story until

732
00:31:10,135 --> 00:31:11,369
you can read the whole thing

733
00:31:11,369 --> 00:31:12,571
just as beautifully as you read

734
00:31:12,571 --> 00:31:14,206
this part.

735
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:16,942
Okay.

736
00:31:16,942 --> 00:31:18,076
Did I tell you I'm keeping

737
00:31:18,076 --> 00:31:20,011
our lessons a secret?

738
00:31:20,011 --> 00:31:22,114
I'm not telling Mom or Dad.

739
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:23,315
And I'm especially not telling

740
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:24,649
Justine.

741
00:31:24,649 --> 00:31:25,684
Really?

742
00:31:25,684 --> 00:31:27,419
Who's Justine?

743
00:31:27,419 --> 00:31:29,154
Oh, there you are.

744
00:31:29,154 --> 00:31:30,288
I brought back the magazines

745
00:31:30,288 --> 00:31:31,490
I borrowed.

746
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:33,358
I was just on my way in.

747
00:31:33,358 --> 00:31:34,493
Uh, you remember Tim.

748
00:31:34,493 --> 00:31:35,527
Hi.

749
00:31:35,527 --> 00:31:36,561
Hello.

750
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:38,063
I'll be in the house

751
00:31:38,063 --> 00:31:39,431
if you need me.

752
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,368
(dog whimpering)

753
00:31:46,104 --> 00:31:47,172
Oh, giving a party

754
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:49,007
I'm not invited to?

755
00:31:49,007 --> 00:31:50,509
It's Mother's china.

756
00:31:50,509 --> 00:31:51,710
So it is.

757
00:31:51,710 --> 00:31:53,044
I take it down every so

758
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:54,079
often and wash it.

759
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:55,113
You should use it,

760
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:56,181
not clean it.

761
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:59,651
Well, I did use it, but then

762
00:31:59,651 --> 00:32:01,419
one day, not long after Brian

763
00:32:01,419 --> 00:32:03,989
died, I dropped a cup and it

764
00:32:03,989 --> 00:32:05,290
broke into about a million

765
00:32:05,290 --> 00:32:09,227
pieces, and so did I.

766
00:32:09,227 --> 00:32:10,328
That one little cup made me

767
00:32:10,328 --> 00:32:11,463
feel like I lost my mother

768
00:32:11,463 --> 00:32:14,633
and Brian all over again.

769
00:32:14,633 --> 00:32:16,501
Stay and keep me company?

770
00:32:16,501 --> 00:32:18,303
I'll dry if you trust me.

771
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:19,771
(dog barking)

772
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:22,307
So, he's the new gardener?

773
00:32:22,307 --> 00:32:23,475
Well, he fixed the damage

774
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:24,543
he did so well,

775
00:32:24,543 --> 00:32:25,710
I decided to hire him.

776
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,012
You don't mind, do you?

777
00:32:27,012 --> 00:32:28,113
Not at all.

778
00:32:28,113 --> 00:32:29,214
I was just wondering

779
00:32:29,214 --> 00:32:30,382
if the picnic lunch

780
00:32:30,382 --> 00:32:32,617
was part of his contract.

781
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:34,753
It wasn't lunch.

782
00:32:34,753 --> 00:32:37,322
(dog barking)

783
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:39,124
It was a snack.

784
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:42,227
(chuckling) A snack.

785
00:32:42,227 --> 00:32:44,262
He brings his lunch.

786
00:32:44,262 --> 00:32:45,664
His mother makes it.

787
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:47,432
Oh, I get it.

788
00:32:47,432 --> 00:32:48,700
The lunch isn't part of the

789
00:32:48,700 --> 00:32:52,070
contract, but the blanket and

790
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,206
the lying in the grass...

791
00:32:54,206 --> 00:32:55,273
You know, I would imagine

792
00:32:55,273 --> 00:32:56,408
that living in the clouds would

793
00:32:56,408 --> 00:32:58,210
get to you after a while.

794
00:32:58,210 --> 00:33:00,445
(chuckling) Hasn't yet.

795
00:33:00,445 --> 00:33:01,513
He is stunning, though,

796
00:33:01,513 --> 00:33:03,215
isn't he?

797
00:33:03,215 --> 00:33:06,251
He has a mild impairment.

798
00:33:06,251 --> 00:33:07,519
I discovered he couldn't read

799
00:33:07,519 --> 00:33:08,687
well enough to follow the

800
00:33:08,687 --> 00:33:10,355
written instructions I left

801
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:11,590
him, so I decided to work

802
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,791
with him on it.

803
00:33:12,791 --> 00:33:14,826
Even so, it could fall into

804
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:16,428
the category of a stray

805
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:19,431
cat rescue.

806
00:33:19,431 --> 00:33:20,632
I didn't find out he had the

807
00:33:20,632 --> 00:33:23,401
problem until after I hired him.

808
00:33:23,401 --> 00:33:24,569
He was so thrilled to have the

809
00:33:24,569 --> 00:33:25,604
work, I couldn't bring myself

810
00:33:25,604 --> 00:33:27,439
to disappoint him.

811
00:33:30,075 --> 00:33:31,676
Okay, I admit,

812
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,545
I have a mushy heart.

813
00:33:33,545 --> 00:33:34,613
(chuckling)

814
00:33:34,613 --> 00:33:35,680
Except when it comes

815
00:33:35,680 --> 00:33:37,182
to getting fixed up.

816
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,586
Dale...

817
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:43,388
I had one magical,

818
00:33:43,388 --> 00:33:46,591
truly wonderful relationship.

819
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:47,726
That's more than some people

820
00:33:47,726 --> 00:33:49,794
ever get, you know?

821
00:33:49,794 --> 00:33:51,596
I do.

822
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:56,201
And I like my life, and...

823
00:33:56,201 --> 00:33:58,370
I like working,

824
00:33:58,370 --> 00:34:01,306
and I like rescuing cats.

825
00:34:01,306 --> 00:34:03,408
And I even like having nosy

826
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,176
neighbors as friends.

827
00:34:05,176 --> 00:34:07,379
(chuckling)

828
00:34:07,379 --> 00:34:11,116
And I admit he's painfully

829
00:34:11,116 --> 00:34:14,619
attractive and very sweet

830
00:34:14,619 --> 00:34:16,655
and really very pleasant

831
00:34:16,655 --> 00:34:18,790
to be with.

832
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:20,225
But I'm not interested

833
00:34:20,225 --> 00:34:22,794
in another relationship, Dale.

834
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,196
Sorry.

835
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:27,265
Whoa!

836
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:28,633
(chuckling)

837
00:34:30,669 --> 00:34:33,405
(car departing)

838
00:34:37,309 --> 00:34:38,576
Well, let's have a little

839
00:34:38,576 --> 00:34:41,579
drink to our kids, shall we?

840
00:34:41,579 --> 00:34:43,882
You know, I'm not much

841
00:34:43,882 --> 00:34:45,650
of a champagne man.

842
00:34:45,650 --> 00:34:47,686
How would you rate that one?

843
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:48,720
I believe that's

844
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,455
a wedding vintage.

845
00:34:50,455 --> 00:34:51,523
I told the guy in the

846
00:34:51,523 --> 00:34:52,891
store, I said these folks are

847
00:34:52,891 --> 00:34:55,360
used to the best.

848
00:34:58,797 --> 00:35:00,398
What's the matter?

849
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:02,500
Oh, nothing.

850
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:03,568
Huh?

851
00:35:06,204 --> 00:35:07,238
I just thought we should

852
00:35:07,238 --> 00:35:08,473
wait for Tim.

853
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:09,507
Well, if we do, we're going

854
00:35:09,507 --> 00:35:11,409
to have flat champagne.

855
00:35:11,409 --> 00:35:13,712
And a cold dinner.

856
00:35:13,712 --> 00:35:15,246
Tim's got two jobs now.

857
00:35:15,246 --> 00:35:16,348
We never know when we're

858
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:17,415
going to see him.

859
00:35:17,415 --> 00:35:18,883
Gardening's the job he loves.

860
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:21,286
He takes after Ron that way.

861
00:35:21,286 --> 00:35:22,487
And even though he's only hired

862
00:35:22,487 --> 00:35:23,855
for Saturday, he goes over every

863
00:35:23,855 --> 00:35:26,591
day and checks things out.

864
00:35:26,591 --> 00:35:27,926
All he ever talks about is

865
00:35:27,926 --> 00:35:30,362
what's growing, what's blooming.

866
00:35:30,362 --> 00:35:31,396
And Mary.

867
00:35:31,396 --> 00:35:32,430
His boss.

868
00:35:32,430 --> 00:35:34,132
The old-lady-gardener type.

869
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:37,469
Well, here's to Justine

870
00:35:37,469 --> 00:35:38,536
and Steven.

871
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:39,804
Hear, hear!

872
00:35:39,804 --> 00:35:40,872
May the wedding go off

873
00:35:40,872 --> 00:35:41,940
without a hitch.

874
00:35:41,940 --> 00:35:43,341
Except theirs.

875
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,377
(all laughing)

876
00:35:49,614 --> 00:35:51,282
Hi, Mom! Hi, Dad!

877
00:35:51,282 --> 00:35:52,317
Mary brought me home because

878
00:35:52,317 --> 00:35:53,718
we have a surprise for you.

879
00:35:53,718 --> 00:35:55,787
Oh, Mary, I'm Esther.

880
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:56,921
I'm Tim's mother.

881
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:57,956
Hello.

882
00:35:57,956 --> 00:35:59,290
Well, we didn't realize

883
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,358
you had company.

884
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:01,426
Maybe we should do this

885
00:36:01,426 --> 00:36:02,661
another time.

886
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:04,529
No, no, no, Mary.

887
00:36:04,529 --> 00:36:05,597
Mary, this is John

888
00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:06,665
and Beth Willis.

889
00:36:06,665 --> 00:36:07,699
Hello.

890
00:36:07,699 --> 00:36:08,767
And, uh, this here is their

891
00:36:08,767 --> 00:36:10,435
boy, Steven, about

892
00:36:10,435 --> 00:36:11,536
to be the groom.

893
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:12,637
Nice to meet you.

894
00:36:12,637 --> 00:36:13,872
And this is Tim's sister,

895
00:36:13,872 --> 00:36:16,307
Justine, about to be the bride.

896
00:36:16,307 --> 00:36:18,476
Congratulations.

897
00:36:18,476 --> 00:36:19,577
There you go, Mary.

898
00:36:19,577 --> 00:36:20,612
Thank you.

899
00:36:20,612 --> 00:36:21,646
Timmy, this is Steven's

900
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:22,714
parents.

901
00:36:22,714 --> 00:36:24,549
Hi. Hello.

902
00:36:24,549 --> 00:36:25,683
Don't you want to hear

903
00:36:25,683 --> 00:36:26,851
the surprise?

904
00:36:26,851 --> 00:36:28,820
Of course we do, Tim.

905
00:36:28,820 --> 00:36:31,222
Sure we do, son.

906
00:36:37,996 --> 00:36:42,033
"Frog walked into the house.

907
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:44,302
It was dark.

908
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:46,037
All the shutters

909
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,473
were closed.

910
00:36:48,473 --> 00:36:50,742
'Toad, where are you?'

911
00:36:50,742 --> 00:36:52,577
called Frog.

912
00:36:52,577 --> 00:36:55,346
'Go away,' said the voice

913
00:36:55,346 --> 00:36:59,617
from a corner of the room.

914
00:36:59,617 --> 00:37:03,688
Toad was lying in bed.

915
00:37:03,688 --> 00:37:07,325
He had pulled all the covers

916
00:37:07,325 --> 00:37:09,360
over his head.

917
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,931
Frog pushed Toad out of bed."

918
00:37:15,500 --> 00:37:16,601
(joyful laughter)

919
00:37:16,601 --> 00:37:19,971
Tim, that's wonderful!

920
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:21,339
You did that?

921
00:37:21,339 --> 00:37:23,441
Well, actually, Tim did it.

922
00:37:23,441 --> 00:37:24,743
His teachers could never

923
00:37:24,743 --> 00:37:27,779
do that.

924
00:37:27,779 --> 00:37:30,381
(sobbing) Oh, Tim.

925
00:37:30,381 --> 00:37:31,449
Let's have a drink to Mary

926
00:37:31,449 --> 00:37:32,484
and Tim.

927
00:37:32,484 --> 00:37:33,518
And don't forget Frog and

928
00:37:33,518 --> 00:37:34,552
Toad.

929
00:37:34,552 --> 00:37:35,587
All right then, Frog and

930
00:37:35,587 --> 00:37:37,589
Toad, and Mary and Tim.

931
00:37:37,589 --> 00:37:38,756
(chuckling)

932
00:37:41,926 --> 00:37:43,895
I'll just go...

933
00:37:43,895 --> 00:37:46,798
fill this up again.

934
00:37:46,798 --> 00:37:48,800
Let me help.

935
00:37:55,673 --> 00:37:56,975
What can I do?

936
00:37:56,975 --> 00:37:59,410
Not a thing.

937
00:37:59,410 --> 00:38:00,478
It's lovely that Tim

938
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:01,846
is learning to read.

939
00:38:01,846 --> 00:38:03,815
Oh, he's a fine young man.

940
00:38:03,815 --> 00:38:05,717
Yes, he seems that way.

941
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,752
And so sensitive.

942
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,420
Yes, he is.

943
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:10,788
Makes me wonder, the way this

944
00:38:10,788 --> 00:38:11,890
wedding affair has

945
00:38:11,890 --> 00:38:13,691
mushroomed so.

946
00:38:13,691 --> 00:38:14,926
I wonder how comfortable

947
00:38:14,926 --> 00:38:17,362
it will be for Tim.

948
00:38:17,362 --> 00:38:18,830
Justine wouldn't dream

949
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:19,998
of getting married without

950
00:38:19,998 --> 00:38:21,866
her brother there.

951
00:38:21,866 --> 00:38:24,068
And I believe Steven has chosen

952
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:26,404
him for one the groomsmen.

953
00:38:26,404 --> 00:38:28,640
I didn't mean the ceremony.

954
00:38:28,640 --> 00:38:29,707
I was thinking

955
00:38:29,707 --> 00:38:30,742
about the reception.

956
00:38:30,742 --> 00:38:33,077
Oh, he's very familiar

957
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:34,546
with the social hall

958
00:38:34,546 --> 00:38:36,014
at the church.

959
00:38:36,014 --> 00:38:37,782
And as long as we keep it to

960
00:38:37,782 --> 00:38:39,817
family and close friends,

961
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:41,519
the way the kids want...

962
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,654
Don't tell me John's

963
00:38:42,654 --> 00:38:45,089
secretary didn't call you.

964
00:38:45,089 --> 00:38:46,124
Oh, I don't know why he doesn't

965
00:38:46,124 --> 00:38:47,392
just fire this woman.

966
00:38:47,392 --> 00:38:49,727
She does this all the time.

967
00:38:49,727 --> 00:38:52,797
We've booked the Park Pavilion

968
00:38:52,797 --> 00:38:53,865
for the reception.

969
00:38:53,865 --> 00:38:55,099
There's so many of John's

970
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,134
business associates that we just

971
00:38:56,134 --> 00:39:00,471
can't... leave out.

972
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:01,539
Tim, Tim knocked

973
00:39:01,539 --> 00:39:02,807
his glass over.

974
00:39:02,807 --> 00:39:03,875
Oh, is he okay?

975
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:05,577
Yes, he's fine, you know, I,

976
00:39:05,577 --> 00:39:06,811
I couldn't help overhearing what

977
00:39:06,811 --> 00:39:09,180
you were saying and, um...

978
00:39:09,180 --> 00:39:10,415
I don't know if Tim told you,

979
00:39:10,415 --> 00:39:11,549
but I have a beach house

980
00:39:11,549 --> 00:39:12,984
where I spend the weekends.

981
00:39:12,984 --> 00:39:16,921
It has a, it has a guest room.

982
00:39:16,921 --> 00:39:18,056
Actually, I was thinking of

983
00:39:18,056 --> 00:39:19,190
asking Tim to do some work

984
00:39:19,190 --> 00:39:20,892
for me there.

985
00:39:20,892 --> 00:39:23,461
Maybe after the wedding,

986
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:25,430
Tim could forgo the disturbance

987
00:39:25,430 --> 00:39:26,764
of the reception and come out

988
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:31,803
to the beach with me.

989
00:39:31,803 --> 00:39:33,137
Tim's right.

990
00:39:33,137 --> 00:39:36,040
You are very nice.

991
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:41,212
(church bells tolling)

992
00:39:41,212 --> 00:39:44,616
(friendly chatter)

993
00:40:04,502 --> 00:40:06,104
Hi. Congratulations,

994
00:40:06,104 --> 00:40:07,138
brother of the bride.

995
00:40:07,138 --> 00:40:08,206
Thanks,

996
00:40:08,206 --> 00:40:09,240
she looked beautiful.

997
00:40:09,240 --> 00:40:10,608
And you look very handsome.

998
00:40:10,608 --> 00:40:12,644
Thanks.

999
00:40:12,644 --> 00:40:13,778
We're awfully grateful

1000
00:40:13,778 --> 00:40:14,846
to you.

1001
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:15,980
Oh, it's my pleasure.

1002
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:18,149
Be a good boy now, huh?

1003
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,722
I don't think Justine

1004
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:25,990
likes you.

1005
00:40:25,990 --> 00:40:27,659
Why not?

1006
00:40:27,659 --> 00:40:30,128
She says you're too young.

1007
00:40:30,128 --> 00:40:33,164
(whooping)

1008
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:44,642
(gulls crying)

1009
00:40:59,524 --> 00:41:00,658
I'm ready.

1010
00:41:00,658 --> 00:41:01,993
Okay, give me a minute.

1011
00:41:07,999 --> 00:41:10,101
(Mary chuckling)

1012
00:41:10,101 --> 00:41:11,936
Okay, ready.

1013
00:41:13,137 --> 00:41:14,205
No, you're not.

1014
00:41:14,205 --> 00:41:15,239
You have to put on

1015
00:41:15,239 --> 00:41:16,274
your bathing suit.

1016
00:41:16,274 --> 00:41:17,575
Well, I'm not going

1017
00:41:17,575 --> 00:41:19,210
to go swimming. Yes, you are.

1018
00:41:19,210 --> 00:41:20,578
I come here almost every

1019
00:41:20,578 --> 00:41:21,980
weekend, I never swim.

1020
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:24,615
But I want you to.

1021
00:41:24,615 --> 00:41:26,050
I'll watch you.

1022
00:41:26,050 --> 00:41:27,085
I don't want you

1023
00:41:27,085 --> 00:41:28,119
to watch me.

1024
00:41:28,119 --> 00:41:29,287
I want you to swim with me.

1025
00:41:29,287 --> 00:41:30,688
Besides, it's silly to live

1026
00:41:30,688 --> 00:41:31,889
at the ocean and not go

1027
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,024
in the water.

1028
00:41:33,024 --> 00:41:35,827
You should go in the water.

1029
00:41:35,827 --> 00:41:38,796
Please, Mary Mary Horton.

1030
00:41:38,796 --> 00:41:41,165
It won't be any fun without you.

1031
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:53,011
This okay?

1032
00:41:54,312 --> 00:41:55,780
Why don't you try the water?

1033
00:41:55,780 --> 00:41:56,814
You come too.

1034
00:41:56,814 --> 00:41:58,049
I will.

1035
00:41:58,049 --> 00:41:59,183
Now.

1036
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:01,185
I'll catch up to you.

1037
00:42:12,330 --> 00:42:13,631
Come on!

1038
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,305
Come on!

1039
00:42:45,863 --> 00:42:48,733
(both laughing)

1040
00:42:51,302 --> 00:42:54,005
See, you're having fun!

1041
00:43:01,078 --> 00:43:02,113
Did you ever love someone

1042
00:43:02,113 --> 00:43:03,981
so much that you left your mom

1043
00:43:03,981 --> 00:43:06,317
and dad and brothers and sisters

1044
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:07,885
and went to live

1045
00:43:07,885 --> 00:43:10,054
in another place?

1046
00:43:10,054 --> 00:43:11,122
Well, I don't have any

1047
00:43:11,122 --> 00:43:12,223
brothers and sisters, and my

1048
00:43:12,223 --> 00:43:13,357
father passed away when I was

1049
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:15,893
a little girl.

1050
00:43:15,893 --> 00:43:17,995
But I loved someone once and

1051
00:43:17,995 --> 00:43:20,164
moved away from my mother and

1052
00:43:20,164 --> 00:43:22,800
lived someplace else with him.

1053
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:23,868
A husband?

1054
00:43:23,868 --> 00:43:24,902
Uh-huh.

1055
00:43:26,938 --> 00:43:29,006
Same as Justine.

1056
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:33,177
Steven's parents didn't

1057
00:43:33,177 --> 00:43:35,079
want me at the party.

1058
00:43:37,348 --> 00:43:40,151
No, they didn't.

1059
00:43:40,151 --> 00:43:41,385
I'm slow, so sometimes

1060
00:43:41,385 --> 00:43:43,688
people don't want me around.

1061
00:43:45,423 --> 00:43:48,292
I can tell you want me around.

1062
00:43:48,292 --> 00:43:49,427
And it's not just because

1063
00:43:49,427 --> 00:43:51,696
you're lonely.

1064
00:43:51,696 --> 00:43:54,699
See, I think you don't like

1065
00:43:54,699 --> 00:43:57,335
that many people, at least

1066
00:43:57,335 --> 00:43:58,903
not as much as you like cats

1067
00:43:58,903 --> 00:44:01,806
and dogs.

1068
00:44:01,806 --> 00:44:02,874
But when I'm around, I can

1069
00:44:02,874 --> 00:44:05,042
tell right away you feel happy,

1070
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:07,278
that's for sure.

1071
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:14,085
We better go in now.

1072
00:44:14,085 --> 00:44:15,786
Just five more minutes?

1073
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:35,239
Doesn't look like

1074
00:44:35,239 --> 00:44:36,307
anyone's home.

1075
00:44:36,307 --> 00:44:37,742
Mom's home.

1076
00:44:37,742 --> 00:44:39,043
She rests in the afternoon.

1077
00:44:43,814 --> 00:44:46,951
Mom, we're home!

1078
00:44:49,387 --> 00:44:50,821
Mom?

1079
00:44:58,863 --> 00:45:00,398
Mom's resting.

1080
00:45:02,934 --> 00:45:04,168
But she must've been really

1081
00:45:04,168 --> 00:45:07,038
sleepy to rest on the floor.

1082
00:45:21,886 --> 00:45:23,788
Tim, your mother is sick.

1083
00:45:23,788 --> 00:45:24,855
You stay with her,

1084
00:45:24,855 --> 00:45:27,258
I'm going to call for help.

1085
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:38,903
Mom?

1086
00:45:38,903 --> 00:45:40,004
Mom?

1087
00:45:46,110 --> 00:45:49,013
Esther Burke Melville.

1088
00:45:49,013 --> 00:45:51,482
We who have known and loved you

1089
00:45:51,482 --> 00:45:53,017
return that part of you which

1090
00:45:53,017 --> 00:45:56,020
is earth to the earth.

1091
00:47:01,252 --> 00:47:03,988
And that of you which is spirit,

1092
00:47:03,988 --> 00:47:05,923
we consign to God's loving

1093
00:47:05,923 --> 00:47:08,092
and everlasting care,

1094
00:47:08,092 --> 00:47:10,194
where it may find peace.

1095
00:47:11,195 --> 00:47:14,198
The Lord bless and keep you.

1096
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:15,366
The Lord make his face to shine

1097
00:47:15,366 --> 00:47:19,103
upon you and give you peace.

1098
00:47:19,103 --> 00:47:21,105
Amen.

1099
00:47:36,253 --> 00:47:38,189
Will she be cold?

1100
00:47:38,189 --> 00:47:39,690
No.

1101
00:47:39,690 --> 00:47:41,058
Her body doesn't feel

1102
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:42,893
anything now.

1103
00:47:45,329 --> 00:47:48,199
But she'll miss me,

1104
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:50,334
won't she?

1105
00:47:52,169 --> 00:47:53,571
She won't feel any pain

1106
00:47:53,571 --> 00:47:55,706
or sadness.

1107
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:59,276
But she'll always love you.

1108
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:02,046
Come on, Timmy.

1109
00:48:02,046 --> 00:48:04,148
It's time to be with family.

1110
00:48:04,148 --> 00:48:06,016
Thank you.

1111
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:10,121
(Justine sniffles)

1112
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:56,333
(sobbing quietly)

1113
00:49:31,168 --> 00:49:32,336
(knocking on door)

1114
00:49:32,336 --> 00:49:35,139
Tim? Ron?

1115
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:36,740
(voices chatter on TV)

1116
00:49:44,481 --> 00:49:46,350
Hello, anybody home?

1117
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:48,319
<i> When you say interactive...</i>

1118
00:49:48,319 --> 00:49:49,353
Hello?

1119
00:49:49,353 --> 00:49:51,789
<i> How can it be interactive?</i>

1120
00:49:51,789 --> 00:49:53,657
<i> Well, it's very important</i>

1121
00:49:53,657 --> 00:49:55,226
<i> that there's some kind of, uh,</i>

1122
00:49:55,226 --> 00:49:56,727
<i> exchange between the person</i>

1123
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:58,495
<i> and the program, the, uh...</i>

1124
00:49:58,495 --> 00:49:59,530
You two need a change

1125
00:49:59,530 --> 00:50:01,365
of scenery.

1126
00:50:03,667 --> 00:50:05,502
You know, given the choice

1127
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:06,704
between your beach house

1128
00:50:06,704 --> 00:50:07,738
and Bali, I would have gone

1129
00:50:07,738 --> 00:50:09,573
for Bali.

1130
00:50:09,573 --> 00:50:10,708
The trip's postponed,

1131
00:50:10,708 --> 00:50:13,277
Dale, it's not canceled.

1132
00:50:13,277 --> 00:50:14,578
Now these need a good soak

1133
00:50:14,578 --> 00:50:15,713
every three days or so,

1134
00:50:15,713 --> 00:50:17,815
depending on the weather.

1135
00:50:17,815 --> 00:50:20,451
How's Tim?

1136
00:50:20,451 --> 00:50:21,552
I'm not sure it's real

1137
00:50:21,552 --> 00:50:22,820
for him yet.

1138
00:50:22,820 --> 00:50:24,121
It's his father who's having

1139
00:50:24,121 --> 00:50:26,323
the hard time.

1140
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:28,125
Mary?

1141
00:50:28,125 --> 00:50:29,260
Do you think you've gotten into

1142
00:50:29,260 --> 00:50:31,862
this thing over your head?

1143
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:34,098
Maybe.

1144
00:50:34,098 --> 00:50:37,268
But I don't think so.

1145
00:50:37,268 --> 00:50:38,435
I feel like what I'm doing

1146
00:50:38,435 --> 00:50:39,770
is a good thing.

1147
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:41,572
And I'm just taking it

1148
00:50:41,572 --> 00:50:43,507
one step at a time.

1149
00:50:44,775 --> 00:50:46,844
Well...

1150
00:50:46,844 --> 00:50:49,213
Watch your step.

1151
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:05,129
You should walk as much

1152
00:51:05,129 --> 00:51:06,230
as possible.

1153
00:51:06,230 --> 00:51:08,532
It helps.

1154
00:51:08,532 --> 00:51:09,667
All I want is to be

1155
00:51:09,667 --> 00:51:12,403
where she is.

1156
00:51:12,403 --> 00:51:13,504
That's how my mother felt

1157
00:51:13,504 --> 00:51:15,539
after my father died.

1158
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:17,875
She said it over and over.

1159
00:51:17,875 --> 00:51:19,143
All she wanted

1160
00:51:19,143 --> 00:51:21,578
was to be with him.

1161
00:51:21,578 --> 00:51:23,180
She just wanted him,

1162
00:51:23,180 --> 00:51:25,582
and I just wanted her.

1163
00:51:46,370 --> 00:51:47,538
Never in a million years

1164
00:51:47,538 --> 00:51:49,440
thought she'd go before me.

1165
00:51:51,208 --> 00:51:52,343
I was the one taking all

1166
00:51:52,343 --> 00:51:54,378
the pills.

1167
00:51:57,448 --> 00:52:01,352
We used to talk about how Tim

1168
00:52:01,352 --> 00:52:02,620
and her would manage after

1169
00:52:02,620 --> 00:52:04,254
I was gone.

1170
00:52:08,926 --> 00:52:11,895
You and Tim will be fine.

1171
00:52:11,895 --> 00:52:14,298
It won't hurt this much forever.

1172
00:52:14,298 --> 00:52:15,833
I promise.

1173
00:52:27,544 --> 00:52:29,213
I'll go get him.

1174
00:52:29,213 --> 00:52:30,547
(door opens)

1175
00:52:30,547 --> 00:52:32,783
(sighing)

1176
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:38,489
Tim, speak to me.

1177
00:52:39,857 --> 00:52:40,891
You're always touching

1178
00:52:40,891 --> 00:52:42,393
my dad!

1179
00:52:42,393 --> 00:52:44,294
I don't want you touching him!

1180
00:52:44,294 --> 00:52:45,329
He's sad, Tim.

1181
00:52:45,329 --> 00:52:46,797
I'm comforting him.

1182
00:52:50,501 --> 00:52:52,603
I'm sad, too.

1183
00:52:52,603 --> 00:52:54,671
I know you are.

1184
00:52:55,839 --> 00:52:58,609
You don't comfort me.

1185
00:53:02,446 --> 00:53:04,648
Why don't you comfort me, Mary?

1186
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:37,848
Mary? Tim?

1187
00:53:40,017 --> 00:53:41,985
We're here, Ron.

1188
00:53:41,985 --> 00:53:43,887
Tim's with me.

1189
00:53:50,527 --> 00:53:52,529
We have to talk about

1190
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:55,966
what just happened privately.

1191
00:53:55,966 --> 00:53:58,368
Just the two of us.

1192
00:54:00,370 --> 00:54:01,438
We have to go back

1193
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:02,873
to the house now.

1194
00:54:08,879 --> 00:54:11,281
Tim, please.

1195
00:54:38,809 --> 00:54:39,977
Good morning.

1196
00:54:39,977 --> 00:54:42,713
Oh, morning.

1197
00:54:42,713 --> 00:54:45,048
I've made some coffee.

1198
00:54:45,048 --> 00:54:46,617
I'm glad.

1199
00:54:48,485 --> 00:54:50,888
Oh, I made a...

1200
00:54:50,888 --> 00:54:52,489
I made a long distance call

1201
00:54:52,489 --> 00:54:53,690
this morning...

1202
00:54:56,493 --> 00:54:58,295
to my lawyer.

1203
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,533
Something I had to discuss with

1204
00:55:02,533 --> 00:55:05,936
him, and, uh...

1205
00:55:05,936 --> 00:55:07,371
it involves you.

1206
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:18,081
See, me and Esther saved for Tim

1207
00:55:18,081 --> 00:55:21,018
for after we're gone, enough

1208
00:55:21,018 --> 00:55:23,754
to put him in a group home.

1209
00:55:23,754 --> 00:55:25,822
It's not a bad place.

1210
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,824
No...

1211
00:55:27,824 --> 00:55:29,026
And there'll be others like him

1212
00:55:29,026 --> 00:55:30,394
there for companionship,

1213
00:55:30,394 --> 00:55:32,062
and, uh...

1214
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:35,732
Well, they say the happiest ones

1215
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:39,002
have family that visit and,

1216
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:40,404
you know, look after how they're

1217
00:55:40,404 --> 00:55:41,672
doing and help them manage

1218
00:55:41,672 --> 00:55:43,073
and...

1219
00:55:43,073 --> 00:55:45,075
That sounds right.

1220
00:55:45,075 --> 00:55:47,878
So, last night it came to me

1221
00:55:47,878 --> 00:55:52,616
to, uh...

1222
00:55:52,616 --> 00:55:54,451
ask if you'd be Tim's family

1223
00:55:54,451 --> 00:55:56,787
after I'm gone.

1224
00:55:56,787 --> 00:55:59,356
To be his legal guardian.

1225
00:56:00,958 --> 00:56:02,960
What about Justine?

1226
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:05,095
Me and Esther agreed, Tim

1227
00:56:05,095 --> 00:56:07,531
would be out of place with her

1228
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:10,467
and Steven and the high-powered

1229
00:56:10,467 --> 00:56:12,769
careers and a lot of little kids

1230
00:56:12,769 --> 00:56:13,937
running around.

1231
00:56:13,937 --> 00:56:15,038
Oh, look, you can tell me

1232
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:18,008
I'm way out of line for this.

1233
00:56:22,813 --> 00:56:24,014
I couldn't talk it over with

1234
00:56:24,014 --> 00:56:26,883
Esther like I'm used to doing.

1235
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:33,056
It's just that...

1236
00:56:38,562 --> 00:56:40,964
You've got a way with him.

1237
00:56:47,804 --> 00:56:50,440
Okay, talk.

1238
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:57,247
Last night, when I comforted

1239
00:56:57,247 --> 00:56:59,916
you, we started hugging each

1240
00:56:59,916 --> 00:57:03,754
other in a different way.

1241
00:57:05,689 --> 00:57:07,724
And then we kissed.

1242
00:57:10,527 --> 00:57:12,929
The first part,

1243
00:57:12,929 --> 00:57:15,232
when I put my arms around you,

1244
00:57:15,232 --> 00:57:17,434
that was comforting.

1245
00:57:18,235 --> 00:57:21,138
The next part,

1246
00:57:21,138 --> 00:57:25,042
when we kissed each other,

1247
00:57:25,042 --> 00:57:27,611
that was something else.

1248
00:57:27,611 --> 00:57:29,813
I know that, Mary.

1249
00:57:31,748 --> 00:57:34,651
That's something...

1250
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:36,853
married people do.

1251
00:57:36,853 --> 00:57:38,121
Hold and kiss each other

1252
00:57:38,121 --> 00:57:40,290
that way.

1253
00:57:40,290 --> 00:57:41,658
Justine and Steven did it

1254
00:57:41,658 --> 00:57:42,926
when they weren't married.

1255
00:57:42,926 --> 00:57:43,994
Well, they were planning

1256
00:57:43,994 --> 00:57:46,029
to be married.

1257
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:48,532
Tim...

1258
00:57:51,535 --> 00:57:53,770
We're friends and

1259
00:57:53,770 --> 00:57:57,641
I want us to be friends forever.

1260
00:57:57,641 --> 00:57:58,975
But we can't be friends unless

1261
00:57:58,975 --> 00:58:00,811
we promise each other

1262
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:02,045
never to do what we did

1263
00:58:02,045 --> 00:58:05,115
last night again.

1264
00:58:05,115 --> 00:58:06,917
Why?

1265
00:58:09,186 --> 00:58:10,287
Because it changes things

1266
00:58:10,287 --> 00:58:12,889
that I don't want changed.

1267
00:58:16,093 --> 00:58:17,828
Okay?

1268
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:21,732
Okay?

1269
00:58:26,703 --> 00:58:28,171
Okay.

1270
00:58:43,787 --> 00:58:45,722
(distant cheering)

1271
00:59:07,144 --> 00:59:09,646
(horn honking)

1272
00:59:38,809 --> 00:59:40,043
You know your dad and I have

1273
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:43,680
been discussing your future.

1274
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:46,149
He's concerned because he's not

1275
00:59:46,149 --> 00:59:48,919
so young anymore and he wants

1276
00:59:48,919 --> 00:59:51,221
to prepare for the time when

1277
00:59:51,221 --> 00:59:55,091
he goes to be with your mom.

1278
00:59:55,091 --> 00:59:58,728
You mean when he dies.

1279
00:59:58,728 --> 01:00:00,430
Yes.

1280
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:03,400
It's already been arranged.

1281
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,901
I'm going to live with Steven

1282
01:00:04,901 --> 01:00:06,069
and Justine and whatever kids

1283
01:00:06,069 --> 01:00:08,038
they have by then.

1284
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:12,442
Your dad mentioned to me,

1285
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:13,810
he thought you'd be happier

1286
01:00:13,810 --> 01:00:16,246
with some other arrangement.

1287
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:23,119
He found a place.

1288
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,121
It's a converted house,

1289
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:26,857
actually.

1290
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:32,062
A center where people--

1291
01:00:32,062 --> 01:00:34,097
where you could live and

1292
01:00:34,097 --> 01:00:36,199
have friends.

1293
01:00:39,269 --> 01:00:41,872
He asked me if I would become

1294
01:00:41,872 --> 01:00:43,740
what is called your legal

1295
01:00:43,740 --> 01:00:45,742
guardian.

1296
01:00:47,210 --> 01:00:48,445
It's someone who would visit

1297
01:00:48,445 --> 01:00:50,046
you and help you whenever

1298
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:51,815
you needed it.

1299
01:00:55,352 --> 01:00:56,786
I went to see the place

1300
01:00:56,786 --> 01:00:58,788
last week.

1301
01:01:00,290 --> 01:01:01,391
If you lived there, you could

1302
01:01:01,391 --> 01:01:03,360
have your own life.

1303
01:01:03,360 --> 01:01:04,461
And I would be available

1304
01:01:04,461 --> 01:01:06,796
whenever you needed me.

1305
01:01:09,165 --> 01:01:10,433
Would you know

1306
01:01:10,433 --> 01:01:12,068
when I needed you?

1307
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:15,038
Or would I have to tell you?

1308
01:01:23,013 --> 01:01:24,180
Whoa.

1309
01:01:24,180 --> 01:01:25,215
You okay?

1310
01:01:25,215 --> 01:01:26,483
Yeah, I'm fine.

1311
01:01:26,483 --> 01:01:27,517
Just that every time I wear

1312
01:01:27,517 --> 01:01:33,924
this shirt, I get a spot on it.

1313
01:01:33,924 --> 01:01:36,793
Here.

1314
01:01:36,793 --> 01:01:37,994
Thank you.

1315
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:40,997
You're welcome.

1316
01:01:40,997 --> 01:01:42,098
Do you know the difference

1317
01:01:42,098 --> 01:01:43,266
between stew and mush?

1318
01:01:43,266 --> 01:01:45,869
No, do you?

1319
01:01:45,869 --> 01:01:47,270
Well, if your father and

1320
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:48,438
sister get here in two minutes,

1321
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:50,006
we'll be having stew for dinner.

1322
01:01:50,006 --> 01:01:51,074
If they're much later,

1323
01:01:51,074 --> 01:01:53,009
we'll be having-- Mush.

1324
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:54,878
Ron: Something smells good!

1325
01:01:55,879 --> 01:01:56,913
You're early, Dad.

1326
01:01:56,913 --> 01:01:57,981
In two minutes,

1327
01:01:57,981 --> 01:01:59,082
we're having mush.

1328
01:01:59,082 --> 01:02:00,216
What's cooking?

1329
01:02:00,216 --> 01:02:01,351
Or should I say who's cooking?

1330
01:02:01,351 --> 01:02:02,485
Technically, I'm cooking,

1331
01:02:02,485 --> 01:02:03,954
but the truth is without Tim's

1332
01:02:03,954 --> 01:02:05,088
gardening talents, we'd all be

1333
01:02:05,088 --> 01:02:06,556
drinking broth for dinner.

1334
01:02:06,556 --> 01:02:08,491
No, the truth is I grew the

1335
01:02:08,491 --> 01:02:09,926
vegetables, but Mary seasoned

1336
01:02:09,926 --> 01:02:11,061
them just right, that's for

1337
01:02:11,061 --> 01:02:12,963
sure, and there's magic in the

1338
01:02:12,963 --> 01:02:15,065
way she's stirring them.

1339
01:02:15,065 --> 01:02:16,232
Magic in my stirring.

1340
01:02:16,232 --> 01:02:17,334
How about that?

1341
01:02:17,334 --> 01:02:18,368
(Ron chuckling)

1342
01:02:26,810 --> 01:02:27,944
Excuse me.

1343
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:38,421
What's going on?

1344
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:39,456
Could you please tell me

1345
01:02:39,456 --> 01:02:40,557
what business Mary Horton has

1346
01:02:40,557 --> 01:02:41,858
in my mother's kitchen?

1347
01:02:41,858 --> 01:02:44,194
Wearing my mother's<i> apron?</i>

1348
01:02:44,194 --> 01:02:45,362
She's cooking vegetables

1349
01:02:45,362 --> 01:02:47,197
she and Tim grew together.

1350
01:02:47,197 --> 01:02:49,399
What's the matter with you?

1351
01:02:49,399 --> 01:02:50,900
Mary's been a godsend to this

1352
01:02:50,900 --> 01:02:52,002
family since your mother died.

1353
01:02:52,002 --> 01:02:53,036
You know, I would really

1354
01:02:53,036 --> 01:02:54,137
like to know just what

1355
01:02:54,137 --> 01:02:56,473
goes on at the beach house.

1356
01:02:57,507 --> 01:02:58,908
Justine, what's gotten

1357
01:02:58,908 --> 01:03:00,377
into you?

1358
01:03:00,377 --> 01:03:01,544
That woman in there's been like

1359
01:03:01,544 --> 01:03:02,612
an angel of mercy

1360
01:03:02,612 --> 01:03:03,947
to me and your brother.

1361
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:05,181
As far as I'm concerned, she's

1362
01:03:05,181 --> 01:03:06,950
like a member of this family.

1363
01:03:06,950 --> 01:03:07,984
She may be like one,

1364
01:03:07,984 --> 01:03:09,119
but the truth of the matter is

1365
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:10,153
she isn't one, and unless you're

1366
01:03:10,153 --> 01:03:11,187
thinking about adopting her,

1367
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:12,222
I'd like her to get the hell

1368
01:03:12,222 --> 01:03:13,289
out of my mother's apron.

1369
01:03:13,289 --> 01:03:14,391
What are you talking about...

1370
01:03:14,391 --> 01:03:15,425
(knocking)

1371
01:03:15,425 --> 01:03:16,459
Excuse me.

1372
01:03:16,459 --> 01:03:17,560
Dinner's ready.

1373
01:03:17,560 --> 01:03:20,930
Oh, yeah, well, Tim, just,

1374
01:03:20,930 --> 01:03:22,065
just give us a,

1375
01:03:22,065 --> 01:03:24,334
give us a few minutes, will you?

1376
01:03:28,138 --> 01:03:29,506
I've drawn up papers to make

1377
01:03:29,506 --> 01:03:31,241
her Tim's legal guardian

1378
01:03:31,241 --> 01:03:32,976
after I'm gone.

1379
01:03:32,976 --> 01:03:34,010
What?

1380
01:03:34,010 --> 01:03:35,111
I've thought this through,

1381
01:03:35,111 --> 01:03:36,179
Justine.

1382
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:38,915
She's got no kids of her own.

1383
01:03:38,915 --> 01:03:40,016
She's free to give him all the

1384
01:03:40,016 --> 01:03:41,251
attention he needs.

1385
01:03:41,251 --> 01:03:42,385
And like as not, she'll leave

1386
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:43,486
him some security

1387
01:03:43,486 --> 01:03:44,921
when she passes on.

1388
01:03:44,921 --> 01:03:46,423
Dad, have you lost your mind?

1389
01:03:46,423 --> 01:03:47,557
I'm his sister.

1390
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:49,092
Yes, and you're married now

1391
01:03:49,092 --> 01:03:50,393
and soon you'll have children

1392
01:03:50,393 --> 01:03:51,428
of your own.

1393
01:03:51,428 --> 01:03:52,495
Not soon, Steven

1394
01:03:52,495 --> 01:03:53,530
and I have discussed this.

1395
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:54,564
You will have...

1396
01:03:54,564 --> 01:03:55,598
(whispering) a family of

1397
01:03:55,598 --> 01:03:56,633
your own.

1398
01:03:56,633 --> 01:03:58,935
(sighing)

1399
01:04:00,470 --> 01:04:01,905
Honey, I know you love your

1400
01:04:01,905 --> 01:04:03,073
brother and he loves you, but

1401
01:04:03,073 --> 01:04:06,076
believe me, with a career and

1402
01:04:06,076 --> 01:04:07,444
Steven and children,

1403
01:04:07,444 --> 01:04:09,979
it just wouldn't work.

1404
01:04:09,979 --> 01:04:11,114
You've got to look

1405
01:04:11,114 --> 01:04:13,283
at the big picture, Justine.

1406
01:04:13,283 --> 01:04:14,617
Dad, why don't<i> you</i> look

1407
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:16,653
at the big picture?

1408
01:04:16,653 --> 01:04:18,254
What does that mean?

1409
01:04:20,156 --> 01:04:22,058
Come with me.

1410
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:30,166
Mary said we could eat

1411
01:04:30,166 --> 01:04:31,668
because Miss Manners says after

1412
01:04:31,668 --> 01:04:32,936
two people are seated,

1413
01:04:32,936 --> 01:04:34,437
you can start eating.

1414
01:04:34,437 --> 01:04:35,538
Gee, I'd have never guessed

1415
01:04:35,538 --> 01:04:36,639
that Mary even knew

1416
01:04:36,639 --> 01:04:38,208
Miss Manners.

1417
01:04:38,208 --> 01:04:39,309
But since we're talking

1418
01:04:39,309 --> 01:04:40,376
about acceptable behavior,

1419
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:41,544
why don't we bring my father

1420
01:04:41,544 --> 01:04:42,612
into the 20th century and

1421
01:04:42,612 --> 01:04:43,680
explain to him what your

1422
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:45,014
relationship with my

1423
01:04:45,014 --> 01:04:46,049
brother is all about.

1424
01:04:46,049 --> 01:04:47,083
Justine, that's enough.

1425
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:48,118
I'd be happy to.

1426
01:04:48,118 --> 01:04:49,319
My relationship with your

1427
01:04:49,319 --> 01:04:52,255
brother is all about friendship.

1428
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:54,290
All right, I'll give you the

1429
01:04:54,290 --> 01:04:55,725
benefit of the doubt.

1430
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:57,227
I suppose there is a remote

1431
01:04:57,227 --> 01:04:58,328
possibility that you actually

1432
01:04:58,328 --> 01:04:59,395
don't see it yourself.

1433
01:04:59,395 --> 01:05:00,430
You're attracted to my brother,

1434
01:05:00,430 --> 01:05:01,564
whether you're willing to admit

1435
01:05:01,564 --> 01:05:02,599
it or not.

1436
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:03,967
Justine, this is uncalled--

1437
01:05:03,967 --> 01:05:05,034
I think it's time

1438
01:05:05,034 --> 01:05:06,069
for me to go.

1439
01:05:06,069 --> 01:05:07,103
I don't want you to go.

1440
01:05:07,103 --> 01:05:08,171
You know, Justine, you're not

1441
01:05:08,171 --> 01:05:09,205
the only girl that likes me.

1442
01:05:09,205 --> 01:05:10,273
I know that, Timmy.

1443
01:05:10,273 --> 01:05:11,374
And I want you

1444
01:05:11,374 --> 01:05:12,442
to call me Tim.

1445
01:05:12,442 --> 01:05:13,576
You don't call Steven "Stevie".

1446
01:05:13,576 --> 01:05:15,211
Timmy-- Tim.

1447
01:05:15,211 --> 01:05:16,412
I'm trying to protect you.

1448
01:05:16,412 --> 01:05:17,447
Because you think

1449
01:05:17,447 --> 01:05:18,748
I'm a freak. I do not!

1450
01:05:18,748 --> 01:05:20,016
Is that what Mary tells you

1451
01:05:20,016 --> 01:05:21,050
your family thinks?

1452
01:05:21,050 --> 01:05:22,152
I never have and never would

1453
01:05:22,152 --> 01:05:23,253
in my entire life say

1454
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:24,320
such a thing.

1455
01:05:24,320 --> 01:05:25,488
I'm sorry my friendship

1456
01:05:25,488 --> 01:05:26,523
with your brother is

1457
01:05:26,523 --> 01:05:27,757
so difficult for you.

1458
01:05:27,757 --> 01:05:29,025
I respect how much

1459
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:30,193
you care for him.

1460
01:05:30,193 --> 01:05:31,461
You have no idea about my

1461
01:05:31,461 --> 01:05:33,029
feelings for my brother any more

1462
01:05:33,029 --> 01:05:35,398
than you know anything about me.

1463
01:05:37,000 --> 01:05:38,501
But maybe you should.

1464
01:05:38,501 --> 01:05:39,536
Maybe you should know

1465
01:05:39,536 --> 01:05:41,237
that all my life

1466
01:05:41,237 --> 01:05:42,739
I've done everything double.

1467
01:05:42,739 --> 01:05:44,507
Once for me and once for Tim

1468
01:05:44,507 --> 01:05:46,075
because he couldn't.

1469
01:05:46,075 --> 01:05:47,110
And I've done it better

1470
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,144
than perfect, so there would be

1471
01:05:48,144 --> 01:05:49,679
so much accomplishment

1472
01:05:49,679 --> 01:05:51,181
and so much recognition that it

1473
01:05:51,181 --> 01:05:52,382
would spill over onto him and

1474
01:05:52,382 --> 01:05:54,517
he could shine, too.

1475
01:05:54,517 --> 01:05:56,052
And it worked.

1476
01:05:56,052 --> 01:05:57,287
Every time I did something good,

1477
01:05:57,287 --> 01:05:58,354
you could see how it built

1478
01:05:58,354 --> 01:05:59,622
him up.

1479
01:05:59,622 --> 01:06:01,524
But now I'm built, Justine.

1480
01:06:01,524 --> 01:06:04,060
Just like you are.

1481
01:06:04,060 --> 01:06:05,228
And I don't want to live in a

1482
01:06:05,228 --> 01:06:07,630
center when Dad is gone.

1483
01:06:07,630 --> 01:06:08,765
And I don't want to live

1484
01:06:08,765 --> 01:06:10,567
with you, either.

1485
01:06:10,567 --> 01:06:14,103
That's not what I want.

1486
01:06:14,103 --> 01:06:15,271
I was going to ask you,

1487
01:06:15,271 --> 01:06:16,406
but I don't have a ring

1488
01:06:16,406 --> 01:06:19,742
and I know I'm supposed to.

1489
01:06:21,611 --> 01:06:23,079
I want to be Mary's husband and

1490
01:06:23,079 --> 01:06:25,582
flive with her in her house.

1491
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,755
Mary Horton,

1492
01:06:32,755 --> 01:06:35,391
would you marry me?

1493
01:06:42,098 --> 01:06:43,600
Enjoy your book.

1494
01:06:44,601 --> 01:06:45,635
Did you file the Liberty

1495
01:06:45,635 --> 01:06:46,803
shipment packing list?

1496
01:06:46,803 --> 01:06:48,404
Probably, why?

1497
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:49,472
There was an item missing.

1498
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:51,207
I need to follow up on it.

1499
01:06:51,207 --> 01:06:52,442
Oh, no, they shipped it.

1500
01:06:52,442 --> 01:06:53,810
I shelved it and sold it

1501
01:06:53,810 --> 01:06:55,745
a week ago.

1502
01:06:56,779 --> 01:06:58,748
Sorry, I guess I'm not up

1503
01:06:58,748 --> 01:07:00,116
to speed.

1504
01:07:00,116 --> 01:07:01,351
On the contrary, it looks

1505
01:07:01,351 --> 01:07:04,254
to me like you're in overdrive.

1506
01:07:04,254 --> 01:07:05,788
Oh, your travel agent called

1507
01:07:05,788 --> 01:07:07,657
a few minutes ago.

1508
01:07:07,657 --> 01:07:08,691
Couldn't he get me

1509
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:09,759
on a flight?

1510
01:07:09,759 --> 01:07:10,793
I don't know.

1511
01:07:10,793 --> 01:07:11,828
He called to ask me

1512
01:07:11,828 --> 01:07:13,129
if you're all right,

1513
01:07:13,129 --> 01:07:14,764
and he said if you are,

1514
01:07:14,764 --> 01:07:17,133
he's going to kill you.

1515
01:07:18,534 --> 01:07:19,602
I realize you've been

1516
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:20,770
holding this place together

1517
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:22,872
on your own lately, Forbsie.

1518
01:07:22,872 --> 01:07:25,174
I appreciate it.

1519
01:07:25,174 --> 01:07:27,443
I know that.

1520
01:07:27,443 --> 01:07:30,546
I've, um...

1521
01:07:30,546 --> 01:07:31,848
I've gotten myself

1522
01:07:31,848 --> 01:07:33,549
into a situation

1523
01:07:33,549 --> 01:07:36,619
that started out simple...

1524
01:07:38,721 --> 01:07:42,458
and ended up not simple.

1525
01:07:45,361 --> 01:07:48,731
It needs a cooling-off period.

1526
01:07:48,731 --> 01:07:49,766
That's why I'm trying

1527
01:07:49,766 --> 01:07:51,434
to get away.

1528
01:07:51,434 --> 01:07:52,535
You don't need to worry about

1529
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:54,304
anything here.

1530
01:07:54,304 --> 01:07:55,905
After 15 years, I pretty much

1531
01:07:55,905 --> 01:07:59,742
have the drill down cold.

1532
01:07:59,742 --> 01:08:01,210
There is, however,

1533
01:08:01,210 --> 01:08:03,413
one thing you might consider.

1534
01:08:03,413 --> 01:08:04,681
There's a possibility

1535
01:08:04,681 --> 01:08:05,915
that you will finally get to

1536
01:08:05,915 --> 01:08:08,184
Bali and find out that what

1537
01:08:08,184 --> 01:08:09,485
you're running from has come

1538
01:08:09,485 --> 01:08:11,688
along for the ride.

1539
01:08:24,334 --> 01:08:27,203
(distant train whistle blowing)

1540
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:30,707
You going to eat anything?

1541
01:08:30,707 --> 01:08:32,675
I'm not hungry.

1542
01:08:34,177 --> 01:08:35,545
I know I don't cook like your

1543
01:08:35,545 --> 01:08:39,182
mom, but... it's still food.

1544
01:08:48,891 --> 01:08:53,262
Have you been to bed with Mary?

1545
01:08:53,262 --> 01:08:55,431
Have you kissed her?

1546
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:56,833
Made love to her?

1547
01:09:00,737 --> 01:09:03,606
We kissed each other once.

1548
01:09:03,606 --> 01:09:04,774
She made me promise

1549
01:09:04,774 --> 01:09:06,843
never to do it again.

1550
01:09:06,843 --> 01:09:08,878
And you didn't?

1551
01:09:08,878 --> 01:09:12,615
I kept my promise.

1552
01:09:12,615 --> 01:09:15,218
You taught me to keep a promise.

1553
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:21,257
Even though it hurt your

1554
01:09:21,257 --> 01:09:23,893
pride, she was right to stop

1555
01:09:23,893 --> 01:09:25,361
you from doing that again.

1556
01:09:25,361 --> 01:09:27,397
No, she wasn't.

1557
01:09:27,397 --> 01:09:28,431
She liked kissing me.

1558
01:09:28,431 --> 01:09:29,499
I could tell.

1559
01:09:29,499 --> 01:09:30,666
That may be true, but she

1560
01:09:30,666 --> 01:09:33,636
knows something you don't.

1561
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:35,671
And that is that what you take

1562
01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:40,643
for true love is really just...

1563
01:09:40,643 --> 01:09:43,246
a crush you have on her.

1564
01:09:43,246 --> 01:09:44,747
I want to marry her.

1565
01:09:44,747 --> 01:09:45,948
I know that's what you think

1566
01:09:45,948 --> 01:09:49,685
you want.

1567
01:09:49,685 --> 01:09:51,421
Your body wants a woman, Tim.

1568
01:09:51,421 --> 01:09:52,488
That's different.

1569
01:09:52,488 --> 01:09:55,324
My body wants Mary.

1570
01:09:58,261 --> 01:10:00,863
I know it smarts, son, but

1571
01:10:00,863 --> 01:10:03,633
believe me, it will pass.

1572
01:10:04,801 --> 01:10:05,835
Do you know what I'm

1573
01:10:05,835 --> 01:10:06,903
going to do?

1574
01:10:06,903 --> 01:10:08,271
I'm going to enroll you in

1575
01:10:08,271 --> 01:10:10,506
a social program at the center.

1576
01:10:10,506 --> 01:10:12,275
Then you'll see.

1577
01:10:12,275 --> 01:10:14,610
There'll be other women there

1578
01:10:14,610 --> 01:10:16,646
that are more...

1579
01:10:16,646 --> 01:10:19,315
suitable for you.

1580
01:10:19,315 --> 01:10:20,583
And who knows, maybe you'll

1581
01:10:20,583 --> 01:10:22,885
find one that's just right.

1582
01:10:25,955 --> 01:10:27,924
(plates crashing)

1583
01:10:36,899 --> 01:10:38,768
Tell me something, Dad.

1584
01:10:42,338 --> 01:10:44,941
Were you ever "slow"?

1585
01:10:53,483 --> 01:10:55,485
So then that means

1586
01:10:55,485 --> 01:10:58,387
you're not me.

1587
01:10:58,387 --> 01:10:59,522
And that means

1588
01:10:59,522 --> 01:11:02,692
you don't know how I feel.

1589
01:11:02,692 --> 01:11:03,793
Not exactly, Tim.

1590
01:11:03,793 --> 01:11:05,428
I don't want somebody

1591
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:07,897
suitable.

1592
01:11:07,897 --> 01:11:09,432
And I don't want somebody

1593
01:11:09,432 --> 01:11:13,035
just right.

1594
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:16,873
I don't want somebody at all.

1595
01:11:16,873 --> 01:11:19,642
I want Mary.

1596
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:22,044
And if you're ever interested

1597
01:11:22,044 --> 01:11:23,446
in how<i> I</i> feel instead

1598
01:11:23,446 --> 01:11:26,916
of how<i> you</i> feel,

1599
01:11:26,916 --> 01:11:28,050
then I'll tell you

1600
01:11:28,050 --> 01:11:30,786
<i> why</i> I want her.

1601
01:11:42,565 --> 01:11:43,699
I sure wish Mom was here,

1602
01:11:43,699 --> 01:11:46,002
don't you?

1603
01:11:59,649 --> 01:12:00,683
If you like historical

1604
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:01,751
fiction, you'll love this.

1605
01:12:01,751 --> 01:12:03,452
Thanks.

1606
01:12:39,889 --> 01:12:40,957
I'm going away for

1607
01:12:40,957 --> 01:12:42,191
a while to make things easier

1608
01:12:42,191 --> 01:12:44,894
for both of us.

1609
01:12:44,894 --> 01:12:45,962
You didn't answer my

1610
01:12:45,962 --> 01:12:47,663
question last night.

1611
01:12:50,900 --> 01:12:51,968
We can't marry

1612
01:12:51,968 --> 01:12:54,670
each other, Tim.

1613
01:12:54,670 --> 01:12:58,441
Why not?

1614
01:12:58,441 --> 01:13:00,443
Well...

1615
01:13:00,443 --> 01:13:03,212
for one thing...

1616
01:13:03,212 --> 01:13:04,547
there's the difference

1617
01:13:04,547 --> 01:13:05,681
in our ages.

1618
01:13:05,681 --> 01:13:07,583
When I'm an old woman, you'll,

1619
01:13:07,583 --> 01:13:09,885
you'll still be young.

1620
01:13:09,885 --> 01:13:10,987
Then I can take

1621
01:13:10,987 --> 01:13:12,855
care of you, Mary.

1622
01:13:12,855 --> 01:13:15,992
And...

1623
01:13:15,992 --> 01:13:18,728
a good marriage

1624
01:13:18,728 --> 01:13:21,030
is based on similarities,

1625
01:13:21,030 --> 01:13:23,566
so that...

1626
01:13:23,566 --> 01:13:26,202
people who marry each other

1627
01:13:26,202 --> 01:13:28,971
are alike and...

1628
01:13:28,971 --> 01:13:32,174
and they enjoy the same things.

1629
01:13:32,174 --> 01:13:34,944
We like to garden.

1630
01:13:34,944 --> 01:13:36,846
We like to swim together.

1631
01:13:36,846 --> 01:13:39,949
We like to read to each other.

1632
01:13:48,491 --> 01:13:51,060
I can't marry you, Tim.

1633
01:13:53,529 --> 01:13:55,765
Because I'm slow.

1634
01:14:00,736 --> 01:14:01,804
You love me, Mary,

1635
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:03,906
that's for sure.

1636
01:14:09,245 --> 01:14:11,180
That's for sure.

1637
01:14:12,615 --> 01:14:14,717
Then why?

1638
01:14:28,564 --> 01:14:30,900
I'll drive you home.

1639
01:14:37,006 --> 01:14:38,174
(keys jingling)

1640
01:14:51,053 --> 01:14:54,290
Is that all you have to say?

1641
01:14:54,290 --> 01:14:55,624
I haven't lived this long

1642
01:14:55,624 --> 01:14:58,627
by giving advice.

1643
01:15:25,087 --> 01:15:26,822
I'll miss you, Tim.

1644
01:15:28,591 --> 01:15:30,092
That's for sure.

1645
01:15:32,361 --> 01:15:33,729
You think you know

1646
01:15:33,729 --> 01:15:35,331
how much you'll miss me,

1647
01:15:35,331 --> 01:15:38,134
but you don't.

1648
01:15:38,134 --> 01:15:40,035
Because missing someone happens

1649
01:15:40,035 --> 01:15:42,905
when you don't expect it, and

1650
01:15:42,905 --> 01:15:45,007
you feel like the ground is gone

1651
01:15:45,007 --> 01:15:46,275
and you're falling and there's

1652
01:15:46,275 --> 01:15:48,911
nothing to hold onto.

1653
01:15:51,013 --> 01:15:52,214
Isn't that how it feels when you

1654
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:55,251
miss your mom and your husband?

1655
01:15:56,819 --> 01:15:57,953
That's how it's going to feel

1656
01:15:57,953 --> 01:16:00,723
about me, too.

1657
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:43,098
(door opens)

1658
01:16:45,367 --> 01:16:46,902
(door closes)

1659
01:16:49,972 --> 01:16:52,341
(keyboard clacking)

1660
01:16:57,713 --> 01:16:58,747
What are you still

1661
01:16:58,747 --> 01:16:59,782
doing here?

1662
01:16:59,782 --> 01:17:00,850
It's after 9:00.

1663
01:17:00,850 --> 01:17:01,884
At the moment, I'm trying to

1664
01:17:01,884 --> 01:17:04,019
find a sale that I lost.

1665
01:17:05,855 --> 01:17:07,790
But I'm willing to admit

1666
01:17:07,790 --> 01:17:09,024
that only a minute ago I was

1667
01:17:09,024 --> 01:17:11,393
locked in a torrid embrace.

1668
01:17:12,394 --> 01:17:14,830
It's good, you should read it.

1669
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:19,935
Did you come to keep me company?

1670
01:17:19,935 --> 01:17:21,036
I came to look for a book

1671
01:17:21,036 --> 01:17:22,071
on relationships.

1672
01:17:24,240 --> 01:17:25,708
That would be psychology.

1673
01:17:25,708 --> 01:17:27,977
Two aisles down on your left.

1674
01:17:27,977 --> 01:17:30,212
Tell me, Forbsie,

1675
01:17:30,212 --> 01:17:33,015
when you think about your life,

1676
01:17:33,015 --> 01:17:37,086
I mean... your life up till now,

1677
01:17:37,086 --> 01:17:39,088
do you have regrets?

1678
01:17:40,356 --> 01:17:41,757
Is this a near-death

1679
01:17:41,757 --> 01:17:42,892
experience?

1680
01:17:42,892 --> 01:17:44,059
I mean, are you the one that's

1681
01:17:44,059 --> 01:17:45,361
going to take me through my life

1682
01:17:45,361 --> 01:17:47,730
in review?

1683
01:17:47,730 --> 01:17:49,231
No.

1684
01:17:50,833 --> 01:17:53,035
I just want to know.

1685
01:17:55,938 --> 01:17:57,039
Sure.

1686
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,910
I wish that I had let my gut

1687
01:18:00,910 --> 01:18:03,078
navigate my life's journey,

1688
01:18:03,078 --> 01:18:04,380
more than all the "shoulds"

1689
01:18:04,380 --> 01:18:07,883
I heard from everyone around me.

1690
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:09,151
And where do you think

1691
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:10,352
your "gut" would've taken you

1692
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:12,321
that the "shoulds" didn't?

1693
01:18:12,321 --> 01:18:14,089
Into some wonderful trouble,

1694
01:18:14,089 --> 01:18:16,525
I imagine.

1695
01:18:16,525 --> 01:18:18,127
The truth is that

1696
01:18:18,127 --> 01:18:19,995
all my life I had damn good

1697
01:18:19,995 --> 01:18:21,830
reasons why not to do this and

1698
01:18:21,830 --> 01:18:24,133
why not to do that.

1699
01:18:24,133 --> 01:18:26,068
And now all I can remember are

1700
01:18:26,068 --> 01:18:28,137
the things that I didn't do.

1701
01:18:31,941 --> 01:18:33,475
Has it ever occurred to you

1702
01:18:33,475 --> 01:18:35,978
that all of these tomes,

1703
01:18:35,978 --> 01:18:39,248
all these pages, all these words

1704
01:18:39,248 --> 01:18:41,917
are nothing more than the

1705
01:18:41,917 --> 01:18:44,320
ongoing age-old attempt

1706
01:18:44,320 --> 01:18:48,290
to figure it all out?

1707
01:18:48,290 --> 01:18:50,793
It has occurred to me.

1708
01:18:50,793 --> 01:18:51,894
And have you ever realized

1709
01:18:51,894 --> 01:18:54,330
that nobody has yet?

1710
01:18:54,330 --> 01:18:55,397
And if they ever do,

1711
01:18:55,397 --> 01:18:58,000
we'll be out of business.

1712
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:00,836
So, by logical progression,

1713
01:19:00,836 --> 01:19:02,805
it seems to me that the only

1714
01:19:02,805 --> 01:19:05,274
thing to do in this life is to

1715
01:19:05,274 --> 01:19:06,575
write your own book.

1716
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:09,478
Make it up as you go along.

1717
01:19:15,818 --> 01:19:16,852
Hey, I hadn't finished

1718
01:19:16,852 --> 01:19:18,287
reading that!

1719
01:19:19,555 --> 01:19:21,857
(Mary's footsteps fading)

1720
01:19:27,863 --> 01:19:29,498
(door closes)

1721
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:48,217
I have something

1722
01:19:48,217 --> 01:19:50,319
I want to say.

1723
01:19:51,553 --> 01:19:53,322
Would you like to sit down?

1724
01:19:53,322 --> 01:19:54,923
No.

1725
01:20:01,163 --> 01:20:03,932
Mostly, I listened to my dad

1726
01:20:03,932 --> 01:20:07,903
all my life because he's a man.

1727
01:20:07,903 --> 01:20:10,105
My mom didn't say very much,

1728
01:20:10,105 --> 01:20:11,307
but she was very nice

1729
01:20:11,307 --> 01:20:13,042
and very good.

1730
01:20:13,042 --> 01:20:15,944
She seemed that way to me.

1731
01:20:15,944 --> 01:20:17,212
And she told me something

1732
01:20:17,212 --> 01:20:20,983
about married people.

1733
01:20:20,983 --> 01:20:22,117
Maybe she thought

1734
01:20:22,117 --> 01:20:25,287
I would be married someday.

1735
01:20:25,287 --> 01:20:26,355
It was different than

1736
01:20:26,355 --> 01:20:29,291
what you said.

1737
01:20:29,291 --> 01:20:32,628
She said the reason

1738
01:20:32,628 --> 01:20:34,296
she and Dad stayed together

1739
01:20:34,296 --> 01:20:36,365
so long wasn't because

1740
01:20:36,365 --> 01:20:38,067
they liked the same things.

1741
01:20:38,067 --> 01:20:40,335
Tim...

1742
01:20:40,335 --> 01:20:41,503
I'm not sure you should--

1743
01:20:41,503 --> 01:20:43,038
She said they were good

1744
01:20:43,038 --> 01:20:45,908
together because of how they

1745
01:20:45,908 --> 01:20:47,943
worked out the things about each

1746
01:20:47,943 --> 01:20:50,412
other that were different.

1747
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:51,914
Especially if they were

1748
01:20:51,914 --> 01:20:54,083
really different, like my

1749
01:20:54,083 --> 01:20:55,918
dad bowls and my mom hated

1750
01:20:55,918 --> 01:20:59,555
bowling, like that.

1751
01:20:59,555 --> 01:21:00,689
Did she tell you how they

1752
01:21:00,689 --> 01:21:03,392
worked out their differences?

1753
01:21:03,392 --> 01:21:07,696
She was patient.

1754
01:21:07,696 --> 01:21:09,498
And she said my dad didn't mind

1755
01:21:09,498 --> 01:21:10,699
it so much when people

1756
01:21:10,699 --> 01:21:13,235
had different ideas.

1757
01:21:16,472 --> 01:21:20,509
Dad gave me advice,

1758
01:21:20,509 --> 01:21:25,247
but my mom knew how I felt.

1759
01:21:27,950 --> 01:21:32,621
I know I'm slow, Mary,

1760
01:21:32,621 --> 01:21:34,656
but I'm not stupid.

1761
01:21:35,724 --> 01:21:39,561
And I'm not a child.

1762
01:21:39,561 --> 01:21:41,964
Mary...

1763
01:21:41,964 --> 01:21:43,265
I'm not taking "no"

1764
01:21:43,265 --> 01:21:44,967
for an answer.

1765
01:21:49,037 --> 01:21:51,340
You don't have to.

1766
01:21:51,340 --> 01:21:53,275
My answer is yes.

1767
01:22:20,102 --> 01:22:21,503
I'm sorry, but this is kind

1768
01:22:21,503 --> 01:22:24,273
of a shock to me.

1769
01:22:24,273 --> 01:22:26,041
Tim told me he was serious,

1770
01:22:26,041 --> 01:22:27,176
but I had no idea.

1771
01:22:27,176 --> 01:22:28,544
How come you married Mom?

1772
01:22:28,544 --> 01:22:30,045
Because he loved her.

1773
01:22:30,045 --> 01:22:31,313
Can we please try to figure out

1774
01:22:31,313 --> 01:22:32,347
what we're gonna do about this?

1775
01:22:32,347 --> 01:22:33,382
What did you love about her?

1776
01:22:33,382 --> 01:22:34,450
For crying out loud, Tim.

1777
01:22:34,450 --> 01:22:35,517
You know what, Justine?

1778
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:36,752
What?

1779
01:22:36,752 --> 01:22:38,253
There are things about Steven

1780
01:22:38,253 --> 01:22:39,488
that I don't like.

1781
01:22:39,488 --> 01:22:40,622
Tim.

1782
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:42,024
And I don't

1783
01:22:42,024 --> 01:22:44,193
like his parents either.

1784
01:22:44,193 --> 01:22:45,360
And there are even things about

1785
01:22:45,360 --> 01:22:46,628
you that I don't like,

1786
01:22:46,628 --> 01:22:48,597
but that's okay.

1787
01:22:48,597 --> 01:22:52,167
Because mostly, I love you.

1788
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:56,438
I fell in love

1789
01:22:56,438 --> 01:22:58,807
with your mom because

1790
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:02,311
she was gentle and good

1791
01:23:02,311 --> 01:23:06,081
and because she loved me.

1792
01:23:07,382 --> 01:23:09,751
That's why I love Mary.

1793
01:23:09,751 --> 01:23:12,387
We understand that, Tim.

1794
01:23:12,387 --> 01:23:13,689
But the question is,

1795
01:23:13,689 --> 01:23:15,457
and I'm trying as hard as I can

1796
01:23:15,457 --> 01:23:19,828
not to be insulting...

1797
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:22,798
Why does Mary love you?

1798
01:23:22,798 --> 01:23:24,700
Ask Mary.

1799
01:23:32,374 --> 01:23:33,642
You're young, Justine, so

1800
01:23:33,642 --> 01:23:35,310
I'm, I'm not certain you'll

1801
01:23:35,310 --> 01:23:36,512
understand this.

1802
01:23:36,512 --> 01:23:38,113
I've only just begun

1803
01:23:38,113 --> 01:23:41,316
to understand it myself.

1804
01:23:41,316 --> 01:23:45,087
But the needs of companionship

1805
01:23:45,087 --> 01:23:47,389
change when you get older.

1806
01:23:56,498 --> 01:23:57,799
I loved one man for a very

1807
01:23:57,799 --> 01:24:02,604
long time, and he loved me.

1808
01:24:02,604 --> 01:24:05,607
And after he died, I didn't want

1809
01:24:05,607 --> 01:24:08,443
to love anyone anymore

1810
01:24:08,443 --> 01:24:12,347
or be loved by anyone.

1811
01:24:12,347 --> 01:24:17,553
But when Tim started loving me,

1812
01:24:17,553 --> 01:24:21,390
I realized how much I wanted

1813
01:24:21,390 --> 01:24:23,525
not just a man

1814
01:24:23,525 --> 01:24:26,428
or a relationship,

1815
01:24:26,428 --> 01:24:28,430
but a kind of love I'd given up

1816
01:24:28,430 --> 01:24:30,299
all hope of ever finding.

1817
01:24:33,635 --> 01:24:37,239
I love Tim

1818
01:24:37,239 --> 01:24:39,641
because he's Tim.

1819
01:24:40,642 --> 01:24:41,777
It's different having a kid

1820
01:24:41,777 --> 01:24:44,780
like Tim.

1821
01:24:44,780 --> 01:24:48,383
The rest of us, we...

1822
01:24:48,383 --> 01:24:50,585
give our hearts away a few times

1823
01:24:50,585 --> 01:24:54,256
and get them punched out...

1824
01:24:54,256 --> 01:24:55,724
and build up walls

1825
01:24:55,724 --> 01:25:00,662
for protection, but...

1826
01:25:00,662 --> 01:25:03,832
With Tim, there's a part that's

1827
01:25:03,832 --> 01:25:06,735
always a kid,

1828
01:25:06,735 --> 01:25:09,538
open and trusting.

1829
01:25:13,809 --> 01:25:15,344
I guess it just scares us

1830
01:25:15,344 --> 01:25:16,878
to see how easy it is for Tim

1831
01:25:16,878 --> 01:25:21,283
when he lets himself love.

1832
01:25:24,920 --> 01:25:26,421
Justine: Mr. and Mrs.

1833
01:25:26,421 --> 01:25:29,825
Tim Melville.

1834
01:25:29,825 --> 01:25:33,562
(string trio playing)

1835
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:07,763
(cat meows)

1836
01:26:07,763 --> 01:26:09,398
Do I look like a bride?

1837
01:26:09,398 --> 01:26:11,199
You look beautiful.

1838
01:26:13,402 --> 01:26:14,469
Bet you never thought

1839
01:26:14,469 --> 01:26:15,604
Tim would be my type.

1840
01:26:15,604 --> 01:26:16,972
Listen, dear, after all the

1841
01:26:16,972 --> 01:26:18,407
years I've spent trying to put

1842
01:26:18,407 --> 01:26:20,342
you in a pair, I'm delighted.

1843
01:26:20,342 --> 01:26:21,476
I was beginning to think

1844
01:26:21,476 --> 01:26:23,412
you didn't even have a type!

1845
01:26:24,980 --> 01:26:26,314
What do you think Mother

1846
01:26:26,314 --> 01:26:27,749
would say about all this?

1847
01:26:27,749 --> 01:26:28,784
Oh, I know exactly

1848
01:26:28,784 --> 01:26:30,452
what she'd say.

1849
01:26:30,452 --> 01:26:32,921
"Mary dear, have you given

1850
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:36,024
any thought to taking the cats

1851
01:26:36,024 --> 01:26:38,260
out of your bedroom?"

1852
01:26:38,260 --> 01:26:39,361
(dog whimpers)

1853
01:26:39,361 --> 01:26:41,329
(knocking on door)

1854
01:26:43,698 --> 01:26:44,733
Hi. Hi.

1855
01:26:48,503 --> 01:26:49,671
Justine, this is my friend,

1856
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:51,473
Dale.

1857
01:26:51,473 --> 01:26:54,910
This is Tim's sister, Justine.

1858
01:26:54,910 --> 01:26:57,312
Holler if you need me.

1859
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:05,987
Open it.

1860
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:07,823
It's not a bomb or anything.

1861
01:27:16,031 --> 01:27:17,365
The apron my mom always wore

1862
01:27:17,365 --> 01:27:18,834
was one that Tim gave her.

1863
01:27:18,834 --> 01:27:19,968
I gave her this one, but she

1864
01:27:19,968 --> 01:27:22,604
never wore it.

1865
01:27:22,604 --> 01:27:24,873
Not even once.

1866
01:27:24,873 --> 01:27:28,777
I thought maybe you might.

1867
01:27:28,777 --> 01:27:31,012
I will.

1868
01:27:31,012 --> 01:27:32,714
Thank you.

1869
01:27:38,420 --> 01:27:39,588
I'm not crazy about

1870
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:41,623
Steven's parents either.

1871
01:27:43,592 --> 01:27:45,560
You know when the time comes,

1872
01:27:45,560 --> 01:27:47,362
Tim and I would be very happy

1873
01:27:47,362 --> 01:27:49,898
to babysit.

1874
01:28:06,715 --> 01:28:07,782
Wish me luck.

1875
01:28:07,782 --> 01:28:09,818
(barks)

1876
01:28:11,486 --> 01:28:14,856
(friendly chatter)

1877
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:33,441
It looks like we're about

1878
01:28:33,441 --> 01:28:34,910
ready to start, so if we can all

1879
01:28:34,910 --> 01:28:36,011
quiet down.

1880
01:28:37,846 --> 01:28:38,980
I understand that the groom

1881
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:40,849
has a short reading for us.

1882
01:28:40,849 --> 01:28:42,117
It's a passage he's chosen

1883
01:28:42,117 --> 01:28:43,752
from a favorite book of his,

1884
01:28:43,752 --> 01:28:45,520
especially for this occasion.

1885
01:28:46,555 --> 01:28:48,390
(paper rustling)

1886
01:28:53,495 --> 01:28:54,829
"Toad blinked in the

1887
01:28:54,829 --> 01:28:57,465
bright sun.

1888
01:28:57,465 --> 01:28:59,734
'Help,' said Toad.

1889
01:28:59,734 --> 01:29:02,637
'I cannot see anything.'

1890
01:29:08,410 --> 01:29:11,146
'Don't be silly,' said Frog.

1891
01:29:11,146 --> 01:29:14,182
'What you see is the clear

1892
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:19,154
warm light of April.

1893
01:29:19,154 --> 01:29:22,591
And it means that we can begin

1894
01:29:22,591 --> 01:29:24,092
a whole new year together,

1895
01:29:24,092 --> 01:29:26,361
Toad.'"

1896
01:29:28,129 --> 01:29:31,099
"'Think of it,' said Frog.

1897
01:29:31,099 --> 01:29:32,601
'We will skip through the

1898
01:29:32,601 --> 01:29:33,935
meadow and run through the

1899
01:29:33,935 --> 01:29:38,039
woods and swim in the river.

1900
01:29:38,039 --> 01:29:40,508
In the evenings, we will sit

1901
01:29:40,508 --> 01:29:41,810
right here on this

1902
01:29:41,810 --> 01:29:43,044
front porch and

1903
01:29:43,044 --> 01:29:46,147
count the stars.'"

1904
01:29:57,192 --> 01:29:59,694
And on that note,

1905
01:29:59,694 --> 01:30:01,463
Dearly Beloved, we are gathered

1906
01:30:01,463 --> 01:30:02,864
together here in the presence of

1907
01:30:02,864 --> 01:30:05,200
God to witness and to celebrate

1908
01:30:05,200 --> 01:30:06,768
the joining in marriage

1909
01:30:06,768 --> 01:30:10,672
of this man and this woman.

1910
01:30:10,672 --> 01:30:12,540
The union of husband and wife

1911
01:30:12,540 --> 01:30:13,942
in heart, body, and mind is

1912
01:30:13,942 --> 01:30:15,543
intended by God for their mutual

1913
01:30:15,543 --> 01:30:17,746
joy, for the help and comfort

1914
01:30:17,746 --> 01:30:19,614
given one another in prosperity

1915
01:30:19,614 --> 01:30:22,050
and adversity.

1916
01:30:22,050 --> 01:30:23,184
Therefore marriage is

1917
01:30:23,184 --> 01:30:24,619
not to be entered into

1918
01:30:24,619 --> 01:30:26,821
unadvisedly or lightly...

1919
01:30:26,821 --> 01:30:30,659
