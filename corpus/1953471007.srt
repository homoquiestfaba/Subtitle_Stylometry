You know,
if you come over here,

I talked to a lot
of sculptors,

and

00:04:50,824 --> 00:04:56,695
I wanted to capture
the moment that
I discovered masturbation.

That's a  <i>Playboy</i> I'm reading,

and a lot of times
my dog, Rex,

75

would watch me masturbate.

It got so annoying that
I'd have to climb a tree
just to get away from Rex,

that he'd watch me.

out of it.

melted perfectly.

00:09:39,212 --> 00:09:41,346
How could you
forget, man?
LARRY: I'm sorry.

169
00:09:41,348 --> 00:09:46,351
Hey, Bill, I got a question.
Have you heard anything
strange going on?

170
00:09:46,353 --> 00:09:48,520
We've been hearing
weird noises

171
00:09:48,522 --> 00:09:53,291
and doors opening and closing
for no reason and stuff.

172
00:09:53,392 --> 00:09:54,926
Could be gnomes.
Gnomes?

173
00:09:54,928 --> 00:09:57,462
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah,
gnomes. They're like
little leprechauns.

174
00:09:57,464 --> 00:10:00,465
They get in through the walls.
They cause all kinds
of problems.

175
00:10:00,467 --> 00:10:03,835
You gotta watch
out for them.
Okay.

176
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:07,772
Hey, do we have any strong
sedatives in the house?

177
00:10:07,774 --> 00:10:10,241
Sedatives?
Yeah, I need

178
00:10:10,243 --> 00:10:15,146
something that's gonna
knock a 400-pound woman
on her ass.

179
00:10:15,414 --> 00:10:18,350
I've been keeping this girl
down in the basement

180
00:10:18,352 --> 00:10:19,417
for about half a year,

181
00:10:19,419 --> 00:10:23,421
and I feed her nothing
but 18 pounds of catfish
every day.

182
00:10:23,423 --> 00:10:27,559
She's gotten so fat, she
can't even move anymore.

183
00:10:27,561 --> 00:10:30,795
She's completely dependent
on me to keep her alive.

184
00:10:30,797 --> 00:10:32,897
That's terrible.
Yeah.

185
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:37,302
But, you know, when
you've been as famous
as I have,

186
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:38,336
for as long as I have,

187
00:10:38,338 --> 00:10:42,340
you've got to do whatever
you can to get your
rocks off, right?

188
00:10:42,908 --> 00:10:48,346
What? Whoa! God damn it!
Look out! Look out!

189
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:50,715
Whoa!
What?

190
00:10:52,451 --> 00:10:54,419
Did you see him?
LARRY & KATIE: What?

191
00:10:54,421 --> 00:10:56,187
The gnome?
LARRY: A gnome?

192
00:10:56,189 --> 00:10:58,089
KATIE: Gnome?
Oh, come on, Larry.

193
00:10:58,091 --> 00:11:00,525
You didn't
see the gnome?
KATIE: No.

194
00:11:00,527 --> 00:11:02,360
BILL: It was right there.

195
00:11:02,362 --> 00:11:04,295
LARRY: I didn't see it.

196
00:11:04,297 --> 00:11:07,832
You know,
I did a little angel dust
a little while ago.

197
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:09,567
I don't know,
maybe that's it.

198
00:11:09,569 --> 00:11:11,102
I think you dropped
something, Bill.

199
00:11:11,104 --> 00:11:13,705
LARRY: Yeah, you
dropped something.
What's that?

200
00:11:13,707 --> 00:11:15,073
Is that...

201
00:11:15,075 --> 00:11:17,409
KATIE: Is that a finger?

202
00:11:17,411 --> 00:11:20,612
Oh... Oh, yes.

203
00:11:20,614 --> 00:11:23,748
Yes, indeed.
That is a finger.

204
00:11:24,183 --> 00:11:24,616
(CHUCKLES)

205
00:11:24,618 --> 00:11:29,854
I won this off a Somali pirate
some years ago in a game
of five-finger fillet.

206
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:34,726
Little bastards. Not nearly
as good with the blade
as you'd think they are.

207
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:37,429
Okay. All right.
Going back down
to my basement.

208
00:11:37,431 --> 00:11:40,565
Goodbye. Goodbye, Larry.
Goodbye.

209
00:11:40,567 --> 00:11:41,866
LARRY: Good night.
BILL: Good night.

210
00:11:41,868 --> 00:11:43,234
KATIE: Good night, Bill.
BILL: Have a good one.

211
00:11:43,236 --> 00:11:45,870
LARRY: Have a good one.
Jesus!
BILL: God damn it!
Son of a bitch!

212
00:11:45,872 --> 00:11:49,808
LARRY: Look out! Look out.
BILL: Fuck. God damn!

213
00:11:50,409 --> 00:11:54,145
Watch out for
those little fuckers, man.
LARRY: Okay.

214
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,081
You can't be
too careful.
LARRY: Okay.

215
00:11:56,083 --> 00:11:58,450
Okay?
LARRY: Yeah.

216
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,153
LARRY: Love that guy.

217
00:12:02,155 --> 00:12:04,089
LARRY: Can we do
a sound test real quick?

218
00:12:04,091 --> 00:12:08,259
I want to see how good
this mike is.
What should I do?

219
00:12:08,261 --> 00:12:10,962
Just whisper something creepy.

220
00:12:11,230 --> 00:12:13,298
(ANIMAL-LIKE GROWL)

221
00:12:13,866 --> 00:12:18,002
Okay. But this time
try to speak up. I'm
testing the mike here.

222
00:12:18,004 --> 00:12:20,205
Okay. One more time.

223
00:12:20,940 --> 00:12:23,341
(ANIMAL-LIKE GROWL)

224
00:12:23,343 --> 00:12:25,143
LARRY: Okay, go ahead!

225
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:26,478
(KATIE GROWLS ANIMALISTICALLY)

226
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:30,648
Wow! This mike is really
good. It's like you're
standing right...

227
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:32,383
(ANIMAL-LIKE GROWL)

228
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:35,286
Okay. That looks pretty good.

229
00:12:35,288 --> 00:12:36,855
Are you gonna
have that camera
on every night now?

230
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:40,558
We have to
if we want to
catch this thing in action.

231
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:44,529
All right. Camera man,
what do you think?

232
00:12:44,531 --> 00:12:48,266
I'm flying a 12K par on a
condor and a couple of 650s

233
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:52,003
with CTB
for an ang light, nigga.

234
00:12:52,005 --> 00:12:55,774
Where do you want me, sir?
What scene number
is this again?

235
00:12:57,109 --> 00:13:00,111
What was that?
LARRY: I don't know.

236
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,813
Larry!

237
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,616
(SHUSHING)

238
00:13:05,217 --> 00:13:07,685
It's coming from here.

239
00:13:08,788 --> 00:13:11,356
Wait! Composer?

240
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:14,092
Yes, sir.

241
00:13:14,094 --> 00:13:18,363
Can I get a little
scary music swell
here, please?

242
00:13:18,864 --> 00:13:20,965
Of course, sir.

243
00:13:24,136 --> 00:13:26,538
(SUSPENSEFUL MUSIC PLAYING)

244
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:30,608
(SIGHS) Don't worry.
It's just a vibrator.

245
00:13:30,910 --> 00:13:32,343
Why would it go off
on its own?

246
00:13:32,345 --> 00:13:36,447
I don't know. Must have
some sort of timer on it.

247
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:39,184
Why would a vibrator
have a timer on it?

248
00:13:39,186 --> 00:13:40,218
I don't know.

249
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:42,787
So you know
when to go
(BLEEP) yourself?

250
00:13:42,789 --> 00:13:46,624
Hey, wait.
Why was that
(BLEEP) bleeped?

251
00:13:46,626 --> 00:13:52,363
Because, sir, the distributors
want you to maintain
a PG-13 rating.

252
00:13:52,365 --> 00:13:54,666
So I can't say (BLEEP)?
I'm afraid not.

253
00:13:54,668 --> 00:13:58,636
I can't say pig (BLEEP)?
No, you can't
say that either.

254
00:13:58,638 --> 00:14:04,409
Well, what good does
it do in a scary movie
if I can't say pig (BLEEP)?

255
00:14:05,544 --> 00:14:07,178
I'm sorry.

256
00:14:07,180 --> 00:14:09,781
But the script
has a gnarly
decapitation scene

257
00:14:09,783 --> 00:14:13,551
where a paraplegic woman
gets raped and
brutally murdered.

258
00:14:13,553 --> 00:14:18,656
Yeah, and that's fine.
The MPAA doesn't care
about shocking violence

259
00:14:18,658 --> 00:14:23,161
as long as you don't
say any naughty words.
I see.

260
00:14:28,767 --> 00:14:30,568
I feel better.

261
00:14:30,570 --> 00:14:32,804
What the (BLEEP)?

262
00:17:12,498 --> 00:17:15,967
Okay.
Nothing out of the ordinary.

263
00:17:18,771 --> 00:17:20,872
Yeah, just...

264
00:17:20,874 --> 00:17:24,075
Wait. Whoa.
Where's the clown?

265
00:17:25,711 --> 00:17:29,013
Oh, there he is.
(CHUCKLES)

266
00:17:29,581 --> 00:17:31,315
Yeah, no biggie, right?

267
00:17:31,317 --> 00:17:34,185
KATIE: No, seems
like a normal night.

268
00:17:34,753 --> 00:17:37,955
You know, I was thinking
about calling a psychic
to help with our problem.

269
00:17:37,957 --> 00:17:41,893
We don't need a psychic
for that. The pump I ordered
came in yesterday.

270
00:17:41,895 --> 00:17:44,395
No, not that problem.

271
00:17:44,397 --> 00:17:46,564
The problem with our
house being haunted.

272
00:17:46,566 --> 00:17:49,333
Oh! I know a
great psychic
we could call.

273
00:17:49,335 --> 00:17:50,868
He's a waiter at
the dim sum place.

274
00:17:50,870 --> 00:17:53,271
He's always sticking
notes in my dessert.

275
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:54,572
What does it say?

276
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:57,108
"Cheer up,
it's only chlamydia."

277
00:17:57,110 --> 00:17:59,677
There's a lot
of truth to that.
Yeah. A lot.

278
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:02,413
Listen, Katie, this is
a serious matter.

279
00:18:02,415 --> 00:18:05,917
I don't think we can rely
on Chinese mumbo-jumbo.

280
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,518
Okay,
this is what we need.

281
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:10,221
You mind zooming in here?
I don't feel like getting up.

282
00:18:10,223 --> 00:18:14,659
Okay. This guy's
been a practicing psychic
for over 500 years.

283
00:18:14,661 --> 00:18:18,296
He even attended
a psychic retreat
in India for two weeks.

284
00:18:18,298 --> 00:18:21,466
That's a
foreign country.
Yeah. Exactly!

285
00:18:21,468 --> 00:18:24,368
For a one-time fee,
he'll not only
communicate with spirits,

286
00:18:24,370 --> 00:18:27,872
but he'll also pop out
a dent in your car.

287
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:32,543
Okay. We're just waiting
for our psychic to arrive.

288
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:41,252
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

289
00:18:41,254 --> 00:18:42,420
Look at that.
Perfect timing.

290
00:18:42,422 --> 00:18:46,157
Not really. Wish that
would have happened
about 10 seconds ago.

291
00:18:46,159 --> 00:18:48,493
But here we go.

292
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,561
Hi.
Hi, there, folks.

293
00:18:50,563 --> 00:18:52,897
We are going
door to door doing
missionary work

294
00:18:52,899 --> 00:18:54,031
for the Church of
the Latter-day Saints.

295
00:18:54,033 --> 00:18:59,704
We'd like to share our message
of peace and love.
Here, take a pamphlet.

296
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:01,539
It just says, "Fuck the Jews."

297
00:19:01,541 --> 00:19:04,542
LARRY: Oh, you know what?
We're already fans
of Mel Gibson,

298
00:19:04,544 --> 00:19:06,310
but we appreciate it.
Thanks for coming.

299
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:11,149
Hold on a minute.
Hold on, Larry.
Hold on. Hold on.

300
00:19:14,019 --> 00:19:16,053
These folks are
from the Mormon church.

301
00:19:16,055 --> 00:19:17,922
The Mormon church,
right?
That's right.

302
00:19:17,924 --> 00:19:19,190
Yes, yes.
We are.

303
00:19:19,192 --> 00:19:22,260
Well, that is wonderful.
Absolutely wonderful.

304
00:19:22,262 --> 00:19:24,295
I want to hear
all about it, all right?
Great.

305
00:19:24,297 --> 00:19:28,432
Let's go down into
the basement, and we can
talk down there.

306
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:31,135
I have so many questions.
Great.

307
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:32,670
Okay, let's go,
all right.

308
00:19:32,672 --> 00:19:34,005
Hey, let me ask you something.

309
00:19:34,007 --> 00:19:37,308
Do you know how to
get semen out of cat fur?

310
00:19:37,310 --> 00:19:39,944
'Cause I have been
trying for the longest time.

311
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:45,950
You know...
And I used baby powder
and detergent.

312
00:19:45,952 --> 00:19:47,285
(WHISPERS) Where's our cat?

313
00:19:47,287 --> 00:19:49,453
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

314
00:19:50,522 --> 00:19:51,255
Hi!
KATIE: Hi.

315
00:19:51,257 --> 00:19:53,157
I'm Dr. Lipschitz.
KATIE: Nice to meet you.

316
00:19:53,159 --> 00:19:54,959
Good to meet you,
too, darling.

317
00:19:54,961 --> 00:19:57,428
So, why we're here.

318
00:19:57,430 --> 00:20:01,832
You think something paranormal

319
00:20:02,334 --> 00:20:04,936
is occurring
within this residence.

320
00:20:04,938 --> 00:20:07,205
Yes, there's been lots
of odd things happening,

321
00:20:07,207 --> 00:20:09,407
with wall noises,
doors squeaking,

322
00:20:09,409 --> 00:20:12,276
lights switching on and off,
dildos turning on...

323
00:20:12,278 --> 00:20:12,944
Yes!

324
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:14,745
(BUZZING)
(CHUCKLES)

325
00:20:14,747 --> 00:20:20,017
You certainly have some type
of presence here. Nice pink.

326
00:20:20,118 --> 00:20:20,818
(BUZZING STOPS)

327
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:22,453
What will happen
to us, Doctor?

328
00:20:22,455 --> 00:20:26,324
Well, the events you
have been describing

329
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:29,994
are going to slowly get worse.

330
00:20:30,262 --> 00:20:30,795
LARRY: Why?

331
00:20:30,797 --> 00:20:33,197
Ghosts know formula.
Mmm-hmm. I mean,

332
00:20:33,199 --> 00:20:37,735
for the first, like, 45
minutes, they'll slam doors
and whisper your name.

333
00:20:37,737 --> 00:20:40,771
But then things will escalate,

334
00:20:40,773 --> 00:20:43,174
and the last 10 minutes

335
00:20:43,176 --> 00:20:44,942
should be quite compelling.

336
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:47,878
But, Doctor, why is this ghost
after us? What does it want?

337
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:53,918
Well, I believe Larry
knows the answer to that.
Don't you, Larry?

338
00:20:55,153 --> 00:20:56,454
Larry?

339
00:20:56,456 --> 00:20:58,222
LARRY: Well, it's true.

340
00:20:58,224 --> 00:21:01,659
It all happened
when I was 15 years old.

341
00:21:01,661 --> 00:21:04,795
I had an imaginary friend
named Toby,

342
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:06,564
and Toby and I would...
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

343
00:21:06,566 --> 00:21:09,467
Oh, my God. If we're
going to have a
flashback moment,

344
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:11,936
somebody else ought to
be behind the camera.

345
00:21:11,938 --> 00:21:13,504
I mean, really,
where's the dramatic effect

346
00:21:13,506 --> 00:21:15,840
with you on the wrong side
of the lens?

347
00:21:15,842 --> 00:21:20,111
He's got a point.
I'm filled
with points.

348
00:21:24,950 --> 00:21:28,185
Well, yeah, this is...
This is better.

349
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:29,787
Um, okay.

350
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:34,558
It all started
when I was 14 years old.

351
00:21:35,193 --> 00:21:38,896
My dad had just passed away
from alcohol poisoning.

352
00:21:38,898 --> 00:21:43,134
He drank 144
non-alcoholic beers.

353
00:21:43,935 --> 00:21:45,303
That's a gross.

354
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,937
KATIE: That is gross.

355
00:21:46,939 --> 00:21:49,407
No... Never mind.

356
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:52,443
My stepdad used to like
to videotape me at night.

357
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:56,514
He even went so far
as to put a video camera
in my room.

358
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:57,782
<i>I could never figure out why.</i>

359

363
00:22:12,964 --> 00:22:14,899
Yeah. All right.

364
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:19,570
It's bed time.
Why don't you
put on your PJs?

365
00:22:20,005 --> 00:22:20,438
Yeah.

366
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:23,140

Oh, no, no, no.
Not those. Not those.

367

put the training ones on.

381
00:22:57,477 --> 00:23:00,811

It got worse two days later.

391
00:23:39,318 --> 00:23:42,052
My stepdad came into my room
to play a game of catch

392
00:23:42,054 --> 00:23:46,223
and next thing I know
I was being questioned
by the police.

393
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:52,263
Apparently his brains
and his hemorrhoids
exploded simultaneously.

394
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,799
He died instantly.

395
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:57,668

396
00:23:57,803 --> 00:24:00,871

KATIE: It sounds like
Larry was possessed.

401
00:24:17,156 --> 00:24:19,757
Can you help us, Doctor?
I'm afraid I can't, Katie.

402
00:24:19,759 --> 00:24:25,129
What I sensed when I walked
in here and what Larry
has now just confirmed,

403
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:29,300
this is not a ghost
we're dealing with, honey.

404
00:24:29,302 --> 00:24:32,136
This is a demon.

405
00:24:32,838 --> 00:24:33,537
What's the difference?

406
00:24:33,539 --> 00:24:36,106
Well, a ghost will sell you
crack on a street corner.

407
00:24:36,108 --> 00:24:39,610
But a demon will wash
your crack and sell it
back to you.

408
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:44,215
No, I'm sorry. That's
a drug dealer and a hooker.

409
00:24:44,217 --> 00:24:46,250
This is terrible.
I know it is, Katie.

410
00:24:46,252 --> 00:24:47,751
The jokes are stale,
the plot unoriginal,

411
00:24:47,753 --> 00:24:49,954
but nothing
we can do about it, so...

412
00:24:49,956 --> 00:24:52,957
I suggest we do what
Brendan Fraser does.

413
00:24:52,959 --> 00:24:56,794
Take that money and run.
Maybe there's
something we can do.

414
00:24:56,796 --> 00:24:59,396
Should we move
out of the house?

415
00:24:59,398 --> 00:25:01,799
No, I'm afraid that
won't work either, Larry,
you see,

416
00:25:01,801 --> 00:25:04,468
this demon is
attached to you,
so if you leave this house,

417
00:25:04,470 --> 00:25:06,170
it ain't gonna
make a difference.

418
00:25:06,172 --> 00:25:07,338
I suggest you stay here.

419
00:25:07,340 --> 00:25:11,308
Plus, save you a bundle
on below-the-line budget.

420
00:25:11,310 --> 00:25:11,876
Mmm-hmm.

421
00:25:11,878 --> 00:25:14,144
Well, I mean,
should we try
to communicate with it?

422
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:16,313
I mean,
find out what it wants?

423
00:25:16,315 --> 00:25:17,281
Hmm.

424
00:25:17,283 --> 00:25:19,483
No, I don't recommend
that either. You see,

425
00:25:19,485 --> 00:25:23,053
when you start to communicate
with this kind of creature,

426
00:25:23,055 --> 00:25:26,056
you open the door for it
to come on in.

427
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:27,858
So we should just do nothing?
Mmm-hmm.

428
00:25:27,860 --> 00:25:31,762
Yeah. Absolutely nothing.
We should do
absolutely nothing.

429
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:33,697
And end the movie right here.

430

but he is an expert.

437

if you need me.

Yeah.

439
00:26:15,106 --> 00:26:17,308

a lot worse?

about filming me

with it, too.

to be missing.

That's where they get you.

heard something.

Hey.

if you heard anything?

Well, I heard you
knock at the door.
That's why I'm here.

more specific than that, okay?

of a sea sponge, so...

I mean, just look at it.

Certainly is. You should be
ashamed of yourself, man.

next to cleanliness?

would break into a house

broken into, you immediately

is thinking about is Jews.

a bigger problem on
our hands than Jews.

00:41:35,293 --> 00:41:36,459
Larry!

668
00:41:36,461 --> 00:41:37,060
All right!

669
00:41:37,062 --> 00:41:40,530
Boy, first you want
the vote, then you
want equal wages.

670
00:41:40,532 --> 00:41:43,800
Why don't you go
down and check out
creepy sounds?

671
00:41:43,802 --> 00:41:44,701
Larry.

672
00:41:44,703 --> 00:41:46,936
Do you have to
bring the camera?

673
00:41:46,938 --> 00:41:48,938
LARRY: Yes, I do.

674
00:41:59,216 --> 00:42:00,517
Hey! What the hell?

675
00:42:00,519 --> 00:42:02,252
LARRY: Hey, what are you
doing in here?

676
00:42:02,254 --> 00:42:03,887
I'm making a
found-footage film.

677
00:42:03,889 --> 00:42:06,089
LARRY: No, I'm making
a found-footage film!

678
00:42:06,091 --> 00:42:07,090
I was doing it first.

679
00:42:07,092 --> 00:42:07,857
Well, mine's a spoof!

680
00:42:07,859 --> 00:42:11,361
Well, I was making spoofs
when you were pooping
your diapers, you little fart.

681
00:42:11,363 --> 00:42:14,230
Besides, I starred
in a Zucker film.

682
00:42:14,232 --> 00:42:16,366
I starred in a Zucker film.

683
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:18,768
Look, get out of my house.
Get out of my movie.

684
00:42:18,770 --> 00:42:20,570
That doesn't count.
You get out of my movie.

685
00:42:20,572 --> 00:42:22,539
Get out of my movie!
Get out of my movie!

686
00:42:22,541 --> 00:42:23,406
You get out of my movie.

687
00:42:23,408 --> 00:42:25,642
Get out of my movie!
You get out of my movie...

(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

689
00:42:30,214 --> 00:42:33,483
Did somebody call
for a demon hunter?

690
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:34,617
LARRY: I don't think so.

691
00:42:34,619 --> 00:42:39,122
Well, with the economy
being in the toilet, I was
sure hoping to find a job.

692
00:42:39,124 --> 00:42:41,691
I'm so happy you're here.
We haven't slept all night.

693
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:45,094
Well, you know what you
should do is take a
light walk before bedtime.

694
00:42:45,096 --> 00:42:49,599
It boosts serotonin levels
and promotes relaxation.

695
00:42:50,234 --> 00:42:53,770
LARRY: Is that some sort
of ghost hunting tool?

696
00:42:53,772 --> 00:42:54,537
No, it's a cell phone.

697
00:42:54,539 --> 00:42:58,675
I got a new app that
locates Christian singles
in the neighborhood.

698
00:42:58,677 --> 00:43:02,378
There's a real cutie
about four doors down.

699
00:43:02,380 --> 00:43:04,747
Catholic girls
like to do anal.

(CAMERA CLICKS)

701
00:43:05,550 --> 00:43:10,153
Yeah. I think your place
is definitely haunted.

702
00:43:10,155 --> 00:43:12,021
How can you be sure?

703
00:43:12,023 --> 00:43:13,923
I've got a sixth sense.

704
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:14,891
You can see ghosts?

705
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:18,595
No, but I can communicate
with household pets.

706
00:43:18,597 --> 00:43:20,897
Your goldfish is
definitely depressed

707
00:43:20,899 --> 00:43:23,266
and probably seen a demon.

708
00:43:23,734 --> 00:43:24,267
What can we do?

709
00:43:24,269 --> 00:43:28,504
Well, he could do with
a little of this.
There you go, fishy.

710
00:43:28,506 --> 00:43:32,375
She should be better in
the morning. That's for sure.

711
00:43:33,744 --> 00:43:37,413
Yeah. She'll get much
better in the morning.

712
00:43:37,415 --> 00:43:41,351
Where's my manners?
My name's Goff.

713
00:43:41,452 --> 00:43:42,285
Jack Goff.

714
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:43,786
LARRY: Ah. Nope, no way.

715
00:43:43,788 --> 00:43:46,522
My friends call me Jack.
You can call me Jack.

716
00:43:46,524 --> 00:43:49,459
LARRY: What do
your enemies call you?

717
00:43:49,526 --> 00:43:52,428
Inmate 2571044.

718
00:43:55,466 --> 00:43:58,368
But that's in the past,
God willing.

719
00:43:58,370 --> 00:44:03,539
Listen, I don't mind you
filming me, but I'm not going
to sign any release forms.

720
00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:07,543
Ever since I did  <i>Corky Romano,</i>
<i>I've been a little cautious.</i>

721
00:44:07,545 --> 00:44:08,544
LARRY: How do we proceed here?

722
00:44:08,546 --> 00:44:12,582
I'd like to walk
around a bit.
Get a lay of the land.

723
00:44:12,584 --> 00:44:13,683
LARRY: Have you ever
done this before?

724
00:44:13,685 --> 00:44:15,918
Walking? Sure. Ever since
I was three years old.

725
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:18,921
I'd like to think
I'm pretty good at it.

726
00:44:18,923 --> 00:44:22,892
LARRY: No. Demon hunting.
(SHUSHING)

727
00:44:22,894 --> 00:44:24,994
You hear that?

728
00:44:25,195 --> 00:44:27,096
No.
LARRY: No.

729
00:44:27,098 --> 00:44:28,531
Neither do I.

730
00:44:28,533 --> 00:44:29,966
Quick! Go to night vision.

731
00:44:29,968 --> 00:44:32,001
It's going to make it seem
a lot more suspenseful,

732
00:44:32,003 --> 00:44:33,736
when actually
I'm just gonna monolog
about my history.

733
00:44:33,738 --> 00:44:38,541
I've been hunting ghosts
and dealing with the
paranormal for years now.

734
00:44:38,543 --> 00:44:39,609
It all started
way back when,

735
00:44:39,611 --> 00:44:43,179
when I auditioned
for this reality TV show
and I landed the lead.

736
00:44:43,181 --> 00:44:46,716
I thought you looked familiar.
You were on that show
<i>Demon Hunters.</i>

737
00:44:46,718 --> 00:44:49,118
One and the same.
26 episodes.

738
00:44:49,120 --> 00:44:51,087
Yeah, they had me
going all over the world.

739
00:44:51,089 --> 00:44:54,757
Chasing down ghosts
and haunted houses and such.

740
00:44:54,759 --> 00:44:55,925
LARRY: I thought
that stuff was bogus.

741
00:44:55,927 --> 00:45:01,764
There's nothing bogus
about a 2.7 ratings share
on a Wednesday night, sir.

742
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:03,733
Yeah, we made it all up.

743
00:45:03,735 --> 00:45:10,707
Yeah, after three years
of pretending to hear doors
creak and ghosts talk,

744
00:45:10,709 --> 00:45:12,875
something really
strange happened.

745
00:45:12,877 --> 00:45:15,311
LARRY: You started
hearing them for real?

746
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:17,313
No. We got canceled.

747
00:45:17,315 --> 00:45:18,514
LARRY: Oh, I'm sorry.

748
00:45:18,516 --> 00:45:19,649
It's all right.

749
00:45:19,651 --> 00:45:23,086
Yeah, I got pretty
depressed here for a while.

750
00:45:23,088 --> 00:45:26,856
Kept hearing voices
in my head going,
"You're an idiot, Jack.

751
00:45:26,858 --> 00:45:27,924
"You're a loser, Jack.

752
00:45:27,926 --> 00:45:30,827
"You're a loser. Loser.
You're a loser."

753
00:45:34,331 --> 00:45:38,267
At first, I thought
it was my intuition.

754
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:43,673
But then my intuition
was telling me
it wasn't my intuition.

755
00:45:46,310 --> 00:45:48,244
It was a demon.

756
00:45:49,613 --> 00:45:52,782
So ever since then,
I've been using
my powers to...

757
00:45:52,784 --> 00:45:54,217
Help all mankind?

758
00:45:54,219 --> 00:45:56,452
(SCOFFING) What? No.

759
00:45:56,454 --> 00:45:57,687
To try to build
an audience back,

760
00:45:57,689 --> 00:46:01,457
so I can get back
on a reality TV show
where I belong.

00:46:03,762 --> 00:46:05,428
It senses me.

764
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:09,198
Oh, it senses me,
all right.

765
00:46:09,200 --> 00:46:10,666
Yeah.

766
00:46:11,602 --> 00:46:12,835
You feel that?

767
00:46:12,837 --> 00:46:16,906
It senses me, and it
doesn't like what it...

768
00:46:16,908 --> 00:46:18,441
(SHOUTS)

769
00:46:18,443 --> 00:46:20,343
(GROANING)

770
00:46:22,646 --> 00:46:23,246
Didn't spill a drop.

771
00:46:23,248 --> 00:46:28,050
I'm okay. I think we should
check out your bedroom next.

772
00:46:28,986 --> 00:46:31,921
So is this the room where most
of the disturbances happen?

773
00:46:31,923 --> 00:46:33,990
Yeah. A lot of them
do happen in here.

774
00:46:33,992 --> 00:46:36,259
Yeah. Yeah. I can feel it.

775
00:46:36,261 --> 00:46:38,461
I'm feeling stuff.

776
00:46:38,896 --> 00:46:42,298
It's kind of like
a tingling sensation.
Who's that whore?

777
00:46:42,300 --> 00:46:45,301
LARRY: What?
That's my Aunt Linda.

778
00:46:45,303 --> 00:46:46,936
Yeah. I'm feeling,
like, a heat.

779
00:46:46,938 --> 00:46:51,073
Kind of a tingling,
tingling feel.
I don't know.

780
00:46:51,075 --> 00:46:53,910
Oh! They like to possess
stuffed animals a lot.

781
00:46:53,912 --> 00:46:57,647
You know what,
that's my grandmother's.
Can you not...

782
00:46:57,649 --> 00:46:58,714
Pop. Pop.
Hey!

783
00:46:58,716 --> 00:47:00,449
Get over it.
She's dead.

784
00:47:00,451 --> 00:47:01,450
She's not dead.

785
00:47:01,452 --> 00:47:02,118
She will be.

786
00:47:02,120 --> 00:47:06,756
All right. They like
to creep into walls
sometimes.

787
00:47:07,057 --> 00:47:09,192
Feel them out.

788
00:47:09,194 --> 00:47:10,459
LARRY: What is that thing?

789
00:47:10,461 --> 00:47:14,730
That's a, uh...
It's an imaging, uh...

790
00:47:14,732 --> 00:47:16,199
You hear stuff with it.

791
00:47:16,201 --> 00:47:18,201
It's a hearing device.

792
00:47:18,203 --> 00:47:20,536
It looks like
a stethoscope.
LARRY: Yeah.

793
00:47:20,538 --> 00:47:23,706
It's getting warm.
It's a warm kind
of a feeling that I...

794
00:47:23,708 --> 00:47:24,640
You know what,
can you not...

795
00:47:24,642 --> 00:47:28,411
It's okay, Katie. I'm a
professional ghost hunter.
You know what...

796
00:47:28,413 --> 00:47:30,313
Oh, ho, ho! Bingo!

797
00:47:30,315 --> 00:47:34,684
Look what we got here.
The possession of a vampire,

798

Count Juggula!

799
00:47:35,720 --> 00:47:36,786
LARRY: You know what,

800
00:47:36,788 --> 00:47:39,088
I don't think that's
appropriate at all.

801
00:47:39,090 --> 00:47:42,058
All right. Jeez,
I was just kidding around.

802
00:47:42,060 --> 00:47:45,528
All right, where's your
bathroom anyway?

803
00:47:45,596 --> 00:47:47,496
(SHIVERING)

804
00:47:48,565 --> 00:47:50,366
Got a little dribble.

805
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:50,800
(SNIFFING)

806
00:47:50,802 --> 00:47:52,301
Yeah, I'd wash
that if I were you.

807
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:54,570
All right.
LARRY: You were
in there for a while.

808
00:47:54,572 --> 00:47:57,974
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Focus up.
Let's get to work.

809
00:47:57,976 --> 00:48:01,577
All right, let's do
a little peeping.

810
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:04,680
Got anything? Nothing.

811
00:48:04,682 --> 00:48:07,149
Hope I didn't lose him.

812
00:48:07,384 --> 00:48:10,786
Nothing there. Damn it!

813
00:48:10,788 --> 00:48:12,822
Where, oh, where could you be?

814
00:48:12,824 --> 00:48:15,358
Oh, yeah,
I'm getting something.

815
00:48:15,360 --> 00:48:19,362
Yeah, it's big.
It's real big.

816
00:48:20,330 --> 00:48:22,431
I'm getting a rod.
(LAUGHING)

817
00:48:22,433 --> 00:48:24,100
LARRY: All right,
that's enough!

818
00:48:24,102 --> 00:48:26,802
Hey, man. It's cool.
We're cool, right?

819
00:48:26,804 --> 00:48:28,671
LARRY: Yeah. Come on, Goff.

820
00:48:28,673 --> 00:48:31,207
JACK: All right. This is
what's called
a thermal imaging camera.

821
00:48:31,209 --> 00:48:35,478
Let's just scan
the area for anything
out of the ordinary.

822
00:48:35,480 --> 00:48:36,612
How does this thing work?

823
00:48:36,614 --> 00:48:38,781
JACK: I got no ideas.
I just like the pretty colors.

824
00:48:38,783 --> 00:48:42,018
Just stand over there.
Let me get a reading.
Okay.

825
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:44,487
Right here?
Okay.

826
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:45,288
(FARTS)

827
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:47,757
Good God!
I got a reading.
I got a reading.

828
00:48:47,759 --> 00:48:48,758
What? Where?
(FARTS)

829
00:48:48,760 --> 00:48:52,028
Jesus.
This thing's amazing.
What? What do you see?

830
00:48:52,030 --> 00:48:56,732
God dang it!
I lost him.
I lost him.

831
00:48:56,934 --> 00:48:57,767
Wait. Wait.
(FARTS)

832
00:48:57,769 --> 00:48:59,869
I think it's trying to
communicate with us.

833
00:48:59,871 --> 00:49:01,437
Well, okay,
what is it saying?

834
00:49:01,439 --> 00:49:03,139
I'm not sure.
The message may
be too advanced

835
00:49:03,141 --> 00:49:05,141
for our feeble human
minds to comprehend.

836
00:49:05,143 --> 00:49:11,147
Ah, damn it! I lost him.
We know where you are,
you son of a bitch!

837
00:49:11,149 --> 00:49:12,348
(FARTS)

838
00:49:12,350 --> 00:49:14,050
I brought in a cognitive
psychologist

839
00:49:14,052 --> 00:49:17,653
to help relate to your
demon you got there, Larry.

840
00:49:17,655 --> 00:49:20,856
I'm Dr. Luni.
But you can call me Ima.

841
00:49:20,858 --> 00:49:22,591
Ima Luni.

842
00:49:22,593 --> 00:49:24,961
Sounds like you're the guy
I'm here to see.

843
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:26,662
(CHUCKLING)

844
00:49:27,130 --> 00:49:30,733
Pretty hot for a doctor,
right, honey? I mean, wow.

845
00:49:30,735 --> 00:49:33,302
KATIE:
Larry, get to the point.
Right. No.

846
00:49:33,304 --> 00:49:35,071
So tell me what
you're seeing.

847
00:49:35,073 --> 00:49:37,807
Yeah, you know.
I've been living
in the house.

848
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:42,945
It's just been weird that
all of sudden I get
taken over by a demon.

849
00:49:42,947 --> 00:49:44,280
I think it's got to
be a demon,

850
00:49:44,282 --> 00:49:49,485
'cause it makes me
say stuff and do things
I would never do.

851
00:49:49,487 --> 00:49:52,822
But it takes over me
and I don't know
how to stop...

852
00:49:52,824 --> 00:49:54,724
(GURGLING)

853
00:49:55,292 --> 00:49:57,693
This is the demon
inside of Larry!

854
00:49:57,695 --> 00:50:00,329
And he's thinking
that you're pretty hot,

855
00:50:00,331 --> 00:50:05,001
and maybe you,
Katie and me could go out
to dinner and drinks sometime

856
00:50:05,003 --> 00:50:09,739
and maybe get to know
each other and
fool around, I don't know.

857
00:50:09,741 --> 00:50:14,610
Whoa, God! It happened.
It happened.

858
00:50:14,778 --> 00:50:16,045
What did it say?

859
00:50:16,047 --> 00:50:19,382
Nothing. He just
introduced himself.

860
00:50:19,583 --> 00:50:21,584
Oh, that's... That's weird.

861
00:50:21,586 --> 00:50:22,918
Usually he's
a lot more forward.

862
00:50:22,920 --> 00:50:28,958
He's a demon,
he's kind of a dick...
He didn't say anything?

863
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,526
Nope.

864
00:50:31,395 --> 00:50:35,998
Get the cotton out of your
ears, you dummy!
I'm talking about fucking!

865
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:40,503
I'm a demon, let's get
it on. You, me and Katie!
Come on, baby.

866
00:50:40,505 --> 00:50:42,905
I can fuck all night,
I can fuck all night.

867
00:50:42,907 --> 00:50:48,477
Whoa, man. Oh, boy.
Felt that one.
That was a big one.

868
00:50:48,479 --> 00:50:49,779
What'd he say?

869
00:50:49,781 --> 00:50:53,282
He gave me a recipe
for chocolate chip cookies.

870
00:50:53,284 --> 00:50:55,418
Cookies?
Yeah.

871
00:50:55,420 --> 00:50:56,919
Oh, that's bizarre.

872
00:50:56,921 --> 00:51:01,657
Weird. Sometimes he says
stuff that's really rude.

873
00:51:03,226 --> 00:51:07,430
I'm talking about a
threesome, you dumbass.
I'm talking about me...

874
00:51:07,432 --> 00:51:11,634
I'm talking about a foursome.
Me, you, Katie and you.

875
00:51:11,636 --> 00:51:15,971
We all get it on.
We'll go upstairs
and watch dirty movies,

876
00:51:15,973 --> 00:51:19,575
get in the bathtub,
put some hot lotion on us.

877
00:51:19,577 --> 00:51:21,944
We can jerk it and suck it
and fuck it all night.

878
00:51:21,946 --> 00:51:26,382
Sticking fingers in holes,
you get it front side,
I'll get backside,

879
00:51:26,384 --> 00:51:31,287
up top and we're going
to get to town and...
(GRUNTING)

880
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:35,758
Whoa. My goodness.
I got possessed.

881
00:51:35,760 --> 00:51:36,425
I think I had your guy!

882
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:40,830
No, I don't think you did,
because she's the doctor and
I know it doesn't jump people.

883
00:51:40,832 --> 00:51:41,931
No, it does.
I'm a demon hunter

884
00:51:41,933 --> 00:51:45,668
and this one, I think he was
Italian and really strong.

885
00:51:45,670 --> 00:51:49,672
No, I don't think it was,
'cause I don't think...
My demon...

886
00:51:49,674 --> 00:51:54,043
The fuck are you doing, Goff?
Get the hell outta here! This
is my thing going on here.

887
00:51:54,045 --> 00:51:57,680
Why do you have to be
so selfish all the time,
for God's sake?

888
00:51:57,682 --> 00:51:59,048
I'll just sit in the corner
and whack off.

889
00:51:59,050 --> 00:52:01,784
What the fuck?
I don't want to
see you whack off!

890
00:52:01,786 --> 00:52:03,152
My dick won't even
touch your dick!

891
00:52:03,154 --> 00:52:05,020
I don't wanna see
your fucking dick!

892
00:52:05,022 --> 00:52:07,389
Wait! Stop! Enough!

893
00:52:07,391 --> 00:52:08,524
(GROANING)

894
00:52:08,526 --> 00:52:10,392
(DEMONIC VOICE)
Oh, my goodness!
I'm going to hit you!

895
00:52:10,394 --> 00:52:12,928
I'm going to fucking kill you,
you fucking psychos!

896
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:15,097
I fucking can't stand
the two of you!

897
00:52:15,099 --> 00:52:19,034
I'm going to fucking pepper
spray both of you!

898
00:52:20,704 --> 00:52:22,071
Whoa.

899
00:52:22,073 --> 00:52:24,340
What just happened?
That was so weird.

900
00:52:24,342 --> 00:52:27,076
I feel like I was possessed!

901
00:52:27,310 --> 00:52:28,511
What did I say?

902
00:52:28,513 --> 00:52:30,646
BOTH:
You said you wanted
to have sex with...

903
00:52:30,648 --> 00:52:32,214
Me.
Us.

904
00:52:32,216 --> 00:52:34,517
No, me.
Us. All of us.

905
00:52:34,519 --> 00:52:36,352
(BOTH GROANING)

906
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:39,688
My demon has a big dick,
did I tell you that?

907
00:52:39,690 --> 00:52:40,723
Shut up, Goff.

908
00:52:40,725 --> 00:52:43,292
KATIE: Nice one, guys.

909
00:52:43,294 --> 00:52:44,927
That was a bust. Jeez.

910
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:46,629
Hey, I was possessed.
Well...

911
00:52:46,631 --> 00:52:48,464
I was possessed.
Yeah. Me...

912
00:52:48,466 --> 00:52:49,632
KATIE: Sure, Larry.

913
00:52:49,634 --> 00:52:51,000
I was, Katie.

914
00:52:51,002 --> 00:52:51,767
(GROANS)

915
00:52:51,769 --> 00:52:52,568
We still got, Katie.

916
00:52:52,570 --> 00:52:54,904
We could probably get
a threesome going.
Shut up, Goff!

917
00:52:54,906 --> 00:52:56,338
Come on, jeez.

918
00:52:56,873 --> 00:52:58,641
Well, that was a bust, huh?
Sorry.

919
00:52:58,643 --> 00:53:00,409
KATIE: Can we please figure
out how to talk to this demon?

920
00:53:00,411 --> 00:53:02,311
Hey, you want to put
a sock in it, hot pants?

921
00:53:02,313 --> 00:53:03,512
Big boys are talking here.

922
00:53:03,514 --> 00:53:04,446
Whoa, hang on a minute.

923
00:53:04,448 --> 00:53:06,949
All right, all right.
Sorry about that.

924
00:53:06,951 --> 00:53:10,553
All right, listen.
Demon! Demon!

925
00:53:10,555 --> 00:53:14,857
Demon, I'm trying
to communicate with you
right now, listen up!

926
00:53:14,859 --> 00:53:15,291
Um...

927
00:53:15,293 --> 00:53:20,362
I know you're a supernatural
being and probably
prefer to communicate

928
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:24,166
through grunts or
unidentifiable noises.

929
00:53:24,168 --> 00:53:25,568
So let's keep this simple.

930
00:53:25,570 --> 00:53:29,371
One grunt means "yes,"
two grunts mean "no."

931
00:53:29,373 --> 00:53:30,773
How does that sound?

932
00:53:30,775 --> 00:53:32,141
(DEMON GRUNTS TWICE)

933
00:53:32,143 --> 00:53:35,644
Okay, I think I just got
a "yes" and another "yes."

934
00:53:35,646 --> 00:53:38,447
This is going great.
Okay!

935
00:53:38,449 --> 00:53:40,749
We're on a roll here.

936
00:53:40,751 --> 00:53:43,285
Demon, um...

937
00:53:43,486 --> 00:53:45,487
Can you see us?

938
00:53:45,722 --> 00:53:47,289
(DEMON GRUNTS)

939
00:53:47,291 --> 00:53:49,325
All right. This is great.

940
00:53:49,327 --> 00:53:54,096
Demon, are you
the only presence here?

941
00:53:54,664 --> 00:53:56,365
(DEMON GRUNTS)

942
00:53:56,367 --> 00:53:57,866
All right.

943
00:53:57,868 --> 00:54:02,771
Demon, have you been
with Larry all his life?

944
00:54:03,406 --> 00:54:05,007
(DEMON GRUNTS)

945
00:54:05,009 --> 00:54:07,109
Oh, okay.

946
00:54:07,477 --> 00:54:11,447
Hey, Demon, have you
ever, like, sharted?

947
00:54:11,982 --> 00:54:13,115
DEMON: Uh-huh.

948
00:54:13,117 --> 00:54:15,317
Oh, man, I knew it!

949
00:54:15,319 --> 00:54:16,085
I shart all the time.

950
00:54:16,087 --> 00:54:19,955
I sharted on the way over
here, that's why I asked,
'cause my underwear is full.

951
00:54:19,957 --> 00:54:20,956
KATIE: Enough
with the sharting.

952
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:23,292
All right, honey,
I had a question,
okay?

953
00:54:23,294 --> 00:54:24,593
Why don't you just
let me talk to him?

954
00:54:24,595 --> 00:54:28,130
Hold on a second!
Let me talk to
him for a second.

955
00:54:28,132 --> 00:54:29,231
Hang on.

956
00:54:29,233 --> 00:54:32,801
What is it that
you want from us?

957
00:54:33,069 --> 00:54:33,602
(CLATTERING)

958
00:54:33,604 --> 00:54:35,137
What was that?
KATIE: Something
fell in the kitchen.

959
00:54:35,139 --> 00:54:38,741
JACK: Maybe he's trying
to communicate with us.

960
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:42,878
LARRY: He wants us to
use the Louigi board.

961
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:44,246
What's a Louigi board?

962
00:54:44,248 --> 00:54:45,648
Well, it's just
like the real one,

963
00:54:45,650 --> 00:54:48,917
but we don't have to
get clearance from Hasbro.

964
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:52,755
It's working.
It's working!

965
00:54:53,890 --> 00:54:54,423
"I."

966
00:54:54,425 --> 00:54:58,060
Write this down.
Write this down. "I."

967
00:55:02,365 --> 00:55:04,500
Are you moving it?

968
00:55:05,635 --> 00:55:07,136
"A."

969
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:18,447
"M."
He put an "M" in there.

970
00:55:18,449 --> 00:55:21,216
You know what, Larry,
can we get a crossfade
on this thing?

971
00:55:21,218 --> 00:55:24,253
'Cause it's
taking a long time.

972
00:55:29,693 --> 00:55:32,161
"D." Put a "D" down.

973
00:55:32,163 --> 00:55:34,496
What does it say?

974
00:55:35,365 --> 00:55:38,400
"I'm extraordinarily bored."

975
00:55:39,069 --> 00:55:39,468
Huh?

976
00:55:39,470 --> 00:55:43,038
God damn,
you're black-hearted,
Demon. Come on!

977
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:44,873
Quit playing games!

978
00:55:44,875 --> 00:55:47,343
LARRY: Well it is a game.

979
00:55:47,345 --> 00:55:51,347
What do you want
from Larry? What?

980
00:55:52,082 --> 00:55:52,715
Answer us!

981
00:55:52,717 --> 00:55:56,318
Put your hands on here.
Let's get this done.

982
00:55:59,122 --> 00:55:59,588
"Y."

983
00:55:59,590 --> 00:56:03,892
Hey, Larry, can we just
go montage? I'm getting
kind of tired here.

984
00:56:04,327 --> 00:56:05,728
(LAUGHTER)

985
00:56:05,730 --> 00:56:09,131
Oh, no! The demon
killed Grandma!

986
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:10,999
ALL: Oh!

987
00:56:11,267 --> 00:56:13,168
(LAUGHTER)

988
00:56:13,170 --> 00:56:14,803
I get to go to hell!

989
00:56:14,805 --> 00:56:16,638
ALL: Yay!

990
00:56:17,173 --> 00:56:19,141
(LAUGHTER)

991
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:22,177
The demon says
I'm an alcoholic!

992
00:56:22,179 --> 00:56:23,512
ALL: Whoa!

993
00:56:23,514 --> 00:56:25,481
(LAUGHTER)

994
00:56:25,483 --> 00:56:29,017
The demon gave me herpes,
and I gave it to you!

995
00:56:29,019 --> 00:56:30,386
Herpes!

996
00:56:30,388 --> 00:56:32,621
(LAUGHTER)

997
00:56:32,623 --> 00:56:36,125
You shut your fat faces!
Why am I angry?

998
00:56:36,127 --> 00:56:38,093
We shouldn't be playing this.

999
00:56:38,095 --> 00:56:40,396
ALL: Louigi!

1000
00:56:41,131 --> 00:56:44,700
JACK: "E." All right.
Jeez, what do we got?

1001
00:56:45,702 --> 00:56:47,236
Looks like a poem.

1002
00:56:47,238 --> 00:56:49,104
"Winter wind of death blows,

1003
00:56:49,106 --> 00:56:51,874
"love smells sweet,
soon we'll be one."

1004
00:56:51,876 --> 00:56:52,674
What does that mean?

1005
00:56:52,676 --> 00:56:55,177
LARRY: That's not a poem.
That's a haiku.

1006
00:56:55,179 --> 00:56:55,844
That's not a haiku.

1007
00:56:55,846 --> 00:56:57,980
Guys, I took a class
in college, okay?

1008
00:56:57,982 --> 00:57:01,150
For it to be a poem,
it has to rhyme.

1009
00:57:01,152 --> 00:57:02,384
LARRY: Good point, honey.

1010
00:57:02,386 --> 00:57:03,285
My nose is running.

1011
00:57:03,287 --> 00:57:04,219
That's a poem.
Shut up!

1012
00:57:04,221 --> 00:57:07,856
Okay, what this poem
is trying to tell us...
Uh, haiku.

1013
00:57:07,858 --> 00:57:08,791
Shut up.

1014
00:57:08,793 --> 00:57:14,563
This poem is saying
there's one thing for
certain that this demon

1015
00:57:14,697 --> 00:57:16,965
is in love with you!

1016
00:57:16,967 --> 00:57:18,767
LARRY: Get out of here!
What are you talking about?

1017
00:57:18,769 --> 00:57:21,804
No, it is.
It's in love with you.

1018
00:57:21,806 --> 00:57:23,605
Read between the lines.
Look at it.

1019
00:57:23,607 --> 00:57:28,110
It's saying it wants you and
nobody else to have you!

1020
00:57:28,112 --> 00:57:31,113
That is why he's been
with you your whole life.

1021
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:33,148
That's why you killed
your stepfather!

1022
00:57:33,150 --> 00:57:33,816
How'd you know that?

1023
00:57:33,818 --> 00:57:35,951
I saw the first half
of this movie.
Any good?

1024
00:57:35,953 --> 00:57:38,921
Eh...
Well,
what you're saying is...

1025
00:57:38,923 --> 00:57:40,989
What I'm saying is,

1026
00:57:40,991 --> 00:57:46,328
we've got to kill this
demon before it kills Katie.

1027
00:57:47,263 --> 00:57:48,297
Here! Dramatic effect!

1028
00:57:48,299 --> 00:57:50,165
Zoom in on Katie's face
for this one.

1029
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:55,971
We've got to kill this
demon before it kills, Katie!

1030
00:57:57,340 --> 00:57:59,341
Okay,
how do we kill it?

1031
00:57:59,343 --> 00:58:01,844
We kill it with this.

1032
00:58:04,180 --> 00:58:05,614
Booyah!

1033
00:58:05,616 --> 00:58:10,152
Your demon exists
in a completely different
plane of reality,

1034
00:58:10,154 --> 00:58:12,387
but with this lens
we got right here,

1035
00:58:12,389 --> 00:58:14,556
oh, yeah,
this lens focuses
kinetic energy

1036
00:58:14,558 --> 00:58:17,092
emitted from all kinds of
different objects in the view

1037
00:58:17,094 --> 00:58:22,197
and then focuses this energy
with a phased array
of infrared detectors,

1038
00:58:22,199 --> 00:58:26,535
and elements,
thus transmitting the
electromagnetic pulses

1039
00:58:26,537 --> 00:58:30,906
and allowing us
to view alternate
planes of reality.

1040
00:58:30,908 --> 00:58:32,007
So that's what you got.

1041
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:37,246
And we'll be able
to definitely see your
demon in the flesh.

1042
00:58:38,047 --> 00:58:39,281
Flesh...

1043
00:58:39,283 --> 00:58:40,716
That's what I got for you.

1044
00:58:40,718 --> 00:58:42,117
I have no idea what
you just said to me,

1045
00:58:42,119 --> 00:58:44,052
but I know you've
been drinking all day.

1046
00:58:44,054 --> 00:58:45,454
What? Are you
a drink counter, boy?

1047
00:58:45,456 --> 00:58:47,089
No, I'm saying
you're an alcoholic.

1048
00:58:47,091 --> 00:58:48,924
Yeah, yeah, I already
got a mother, so shut it.

1049
00:58:48,926 --> 00:58:51,026
LARRY: This looks
exactly the same.

1050
00:58:51,028 --> 00:58:51,927
What are you
talking about?

1051
00:58:51,929 --> 00:58:54,997
It's all blurry right there
and the edges are blacked out.

1052
00:58:54,999 --> 00:58:56,031
LARRY: Check upstairs.

1053
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:57,266
We gotta go
this way then.

1054
00:58:57,268 --> 00:58:58,600
LARRY: Okay, you see anything?
Nothing yet.

1055
00:58:58,602 --> 00:59:01,904
LARRY: Okay, if you see
something, just give me
a tap on the fanny.

1056
00:59:01,906 --> 00:59:02,704
What? No.

1057
00:59:02,706 --> 00:59:04,006
Oh, look out!
Look out!

1058
00:59:04,008 --> 00:59:08,277

LARRY: It's a scream light.

(SCREAMING)
It's gone. It's gone.

1063
00:59:16,253 --> 00:59:18,387
Where the fuck is it?
Where'd it go?

1064
00:59:18,389 --> 00:59:19,187
What was that?

1065
00:59:19,189 --> 00:59:21,523
I don't know.
I don't...

1071

The little bastard.

LARRY: Whoa.

1075
00:59:43,614 --> 00:59:45,714
JACK: What happened?
Are you okay?

1076
00:59:45,716 --> 00:59:47,182
Oh, my God! What?

1077
00:59:47,184 --> 00:59:48,283
Are you okay?
You're...

1078
00:59:48,285 --> 00:59:51,053
Are you okay?
Do I look okay?

1079
00:59:51,055 --> 00:59:54,323
I just got shivved
by a demon up there!

(MOANING)

1081
00:59:54,892 --> 00:59:59,027
Okay, okay.
I got one last idea
for you two.

1082
00:59:59,029 --> 00:59:59,461
What?

1083
00:59:59,463 --> 01:00:03,932
Run. Run.
That's what I say!

1084
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:05,467
I'm used to TV show blood.

1085
01:00:05,469 --> 01:00:08,337
This is my blood.
Real blood. Ugh!

1086
01:00:08,339 --> 01:00:12,741
Too real for me.
I'm out of here. Goodbye!

1087
01:00:13,409 --> 01:00:15,344
Larry, I think we should
get out of here.

1088
01:00:15,346 --> 01:00:19,848
Nah, I think we
should stick around,
see what happens.

1089
01:00:20,650 --> 01:00:21,083
Okay.

1090
01:00:21,085 --> 01:00:23,485
Want to go to bed?
Yeah. Sure.

(DEMON GROWLING)

1092
01:00:28,424 --> 01:00:31,526
I can't sleep with
that demon growling!

1093
01:00:31,528 --> 01:00:33,228
Neither can I.

1094
01:00:33,230 --> 01:00:35,597
How are we going
to sleep, Larry?

1095
01:00:35,599 --> 01:00:39,234
I'm going to call
Dr. Conrad Murray.

1096
01:00:41,838 --> 01:00:45,540
Hi, Conrad. It's me.
Yeah, we need you.

1097
01:00:50,580 --> 01:00:53,315
Can we get some
of that Propofol...

1098
01:00:53,317 --> 01:00:56,118
Of course.
Great.

I don't care what they say,
you're a good man.

1102

It's like you're possessed.

trying to come up
with something clever
to end this scene

happened last night.

LARRY: Something happened.

with a gun!

Oh, my God, Larry.

It's not a gun.

That's a penis.

It's balls and a shaft.
Stop it!

Stop it now! It's a handle
of a gun and a muzzle.

Stop it. It hurts.
Balls and a penis

1138

a mushroom head.

brand a penis on you?

Call a priest, but
tell him it's a gun.

It's definitely a penis.
I've seen a million of them.

a gun is? It's a gun,
it's a gun like this.

and I've seen a penis

said we don't want any.

help, though. We're

you've seen them.

entering your home.

it doesn't ring a bell.

It's in the script. Page 35.

Now I see. Yeah.

I have a question. Let me
ask you all something.

1163

If you were stranded on
the ocean, dying of thirst,

1164

would it be better to drink
sea water or your own urine?

think about it.

the basement and
we'll discuss it.

I played Big Mike.
KATIE: I love that movie.

1337
01:18:40,183 --> 01:18:44,418
I heard some commotion.
Just, I got your back.

1338
01:18:44,420 --> 01:18:46,287

1339
01:18:48,757 --> 01:18:51,325

(GROANS)

1341
01:18:53,562 --> 01:18:55,663
This is some bullshit.

1342
01:18:59,167 --> 01:19:01,769

Hey!

1351
01:20:59,121 --> 01:21:04,058
Why don't you pick on someone
in your own universe, Demon?

1352
01:21:04,125 --> 01:21:06,093
Yeah. I tell you what.

1353
01:21:06,095 --> 01:21:10,097
Why don't you and I
discuss this over a brewski?

1354
01:21:10,099 --> 01:21:12,900
Come on,
sit over here with me.

1355
01:21:15,270 --> 01:21:17,071
You like beer, don't you?

1356
01:21:17,073 --> 01:21:18,606
Uh-huh.

1357
01:21:21,376 --> 01:21:26,547
So tell me, why do you
want this guy so bad?

1358
01:21:27,249 --> 01:21:28,115
(DISTORTED)
Well, I don't know.

1359
01:21:28,117 --> 01:21:32,820
I mean, really. I've taken
shits that are more
interesting than him.

1360
01:21:32,822 --> 01:21:33,654
(DISTORTED) I don't know.

1361
01:21:33,656 --> 01:21:36,724
Wouldn't you want someone
with a little more flavor?

1362
01:21:36,726 --> 01:21:41,095
Someone with
a little more pizzazz?

1363
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:46,367
Someone in the top thousand
of IMDb's STARmeter.

1364
01:21:46,501 --> 01:21:49,003
(DISTORTED) Oh.
Mmm-hmm.

1365
01:21:49,005 --> 01:21:52,373
I tell you what.
I know you're bored.

1366
01:21:56,745 --> 01:22:00,080
Why don't you and
I get a little weird?

1367
01:22:00,082 --> 01:22:00,915
Just you and me together.

1368
01:22:00,917 --> 01:22:05,619
That's right. Look over here.
Right here. Now open your
mouth nice and wide.

(BOTH SCREAMING)

1370
01:22:13,561 --> 01:22:15,029
Whoa! What happened?

Larry, you're back.
Oh, Katie!

1372
01:22:17,533 --> 01:22:20,367
His plan worked.
Bill saved you.

1373

He's the best squatter
a guy could ever have.

Where are you going, Bill?

1376
01:22:29,577 --> 01:22:31,745
To the moon, Larry!

Bye, Bill.
Bye, Bill.

1381
01:23:48,523 --> 01:23:53,260

looking for a theater release?

01:23:58,334 --> 01:23:59,733
No way!

1385

you didn't even know it.
