Melinda?

5
00:00:50,651 --> 00:00:52,818
This is your last chance!

6
00:00:55,589 --> 00:00:58,057
Do not fuck with me!

00:00:58,059 --> 00:01:01,994

We forget what we want.

13
00:01:41,635 --> 00:01:44,103
Our imagination has
been traumatized

14
00:01:44,105 --> 00:01:47,539
and relies beyond what
others have laid out for us.

15
00:01:47,541 --> 00:01:48,774

Excuse me, sir.

29
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:45,197
I'm sorry, but it's against
the rules to smoke near a pump.

30
00:02:45,199 --> 00:02:46,632
Well what do
you want me to do?

31
00:02:46,634 --> 00:02:48,133
I just lit this.

I know, and I have
nothing against smoking.

33
00:02:50,971 --> 00:02:52,171
I smoke too.

34
00:02:52,173 --> 00:02:55,274

over there by my van

00:03:02,316 --> 00:03:04,783
Nah, I'm almost done here.

37
00:03:06,453 --> 00:03:08,320
It's just really dangerous
to smoke by the pump.

38
00:03:08,322 --> 00:03:10,189
The whole gas station
can light on fire.

39

I'm not a fucking
idiot, all right?

40
00:03:12,226 --> 00:03:15,961
What do you think, I'd take
this and stick it in a pump?

I wasn't trying
to be mean to you.

They're my favorite
nut in the store.

53
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:10,616
Cool.

54
00:04:10,618 --> 00:04:14,820
If you don't like them,
I'll give you a refund.

the bathroom.

ought to put a sign

What do you mean, people?

107
00:07:43,664 --> 00:07:45,297
Wait, people coming
into the store?

please delete that?

00:07:48,635 --> 00:07:49,835
[Sheila] What are you doing?

111
00:07:49,837 --> 00:07:54,105
What do you care, no
one knows who you are.

- Please can you delete it?

113
00:07:55,342 --> 00:07:56,342
Oh god.

114

Oh, what are you doing, freak?

anyone to see that.

00:08:10,824 --> 00:08:12,324
How can I help you?

122
00:08:12,326 --> 00:08:14,192
Um, what's her name?

123

[Melinda] Sheila.

124
00:08:16,363 --> 00:08:17,762
Sheila, right.

125
00:08:17,764 --> 00:08:18,764
Hi Sheila.

126
00:08:19,666 --> 00:08:22,100
Uh, I was in here
a few nights ago.

127
00:08:22,102 --> 00:08:23,201
Do you remember?

128
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:24,302
It's Fred.

129
00:08:24,304 --> 00:08:26,938
No, I see a lot
of faces in here.

130
00:08:26,940 --> 00:08:29,374
Hi Fred, my name is Melinda.

131
00:08:29,376 --> 00:08:32,143
Um, we were talking and
you were telling me how

132
00:08:32,145 --> 00:08:37,883
your feet hurt so much from
standing all night and so um,

133
00:08:37,885 --> 00:08:41,186
uh, I thought these might help.

134
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:44,456
They're padded insoles
for your shoes.

135
00:08:46,059 --> 00:08:48,927
I'm guessing you're
uh, size nine?

136
00:08:50,030 --> 00:08:52,931
Here, you should uh, try em out.

137
00:08:55,536 --> 00:08:58,236
Wow, these look
really comfortable.

138
00:08:58,238 --> 00:09:03,275
She's right, after a long
shift, we all have aching feet.

139
00:09:04,578 --> 00:09:06,144
I'm not a size nine.

140
00:09:06,146 --> 00:09:08,980
Oh well that's okay because
you can cut these down

141
00:09:08,982 --> 00:09:10,081
if they're too big.

142
00:09:10,083 --> 00:09:11,750
Okay, okay, stop,
stop, stop, okay?

143
00:09:11,752 --> 00:09:13,084
- You could get planters...
- Just stop, stop.

144
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:16,221
I don't want your
foot pads, okay?

145
00:09:17,190 --> 00:09:18,089
I don't want anything from you.

146
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:19,257
Well they're um...

147
00:09:19,259 --> 00:09:20,525
Sheila, I think
he's just being nice.

148
00:09:20,527 --> 00:09:22,060
I don't care how nice
he thinks he's being.

149
00:09:22,062 --> 00:09:24,029
He comes in here every night.

150
00:09:24,031 --> 00:09:26,097
We're not gonna have
some sort of thing

151
00:09:26,099 --> 00:09:27,899
happening between us, okay?

152
00:09:27,901 --> 00:09:29,167
You understand?

153
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:32,470
Excuse me, is there
another register open?

154
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:34,639
[Fred] Um,

155
00:09:37,411 --> 00:09:38,276
Fred, your insoles.

156
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:41,179
I swear to god, he's pathetic.

157
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:43,181
(doorbell rings)

158
00:09:43,183 --> 00:09:46,251
[Customer] Can I get two
of the Lucky 7 scratchers

159
00:09:46,253 --> 00:09:49,087
and two of the Platinum Payout?

160
00:09:50,257 --> 00:09:53,258
(doorbell rings)

161
00:09:56,563 --> 00:09:59,397
The insoles fit
my shoes perfectly.

162
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:00,799
What?

163
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:03,268
It's like Cinderella.

164
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:05,036
The shoe fits.

165
00:10:05,038 --> 00:10:07,339
(door opens)

166
00:10:09,476 --> 00:10:11,776
Your insoles fit my shoes.

167
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,948
(chuckles)

168
00:10:16,950 --> 00:10:18,483
(door closes)

169
00:10:18,485 --> 00:10:22,120
(quiet orchestral music)

170
00:10:27,294 --> 00:10:28,294
Hi there.

171
00:10:29,296 --> 00:10:31,596
Let me know if you need
help with anything.

172
00:10:31,598 --> 00:10:35,066
My name is Melinda, I work here.

173
00:10:35,068 --> 00:10:36,901
Hi Melinda.

174
00:10:36,903 --> 00:10:39,170
Um, that's very kind of you.

175
00:10:39,172 --> 00:10:42,474
Is everyone else that works
here as nice as you are?

176
00:10:42,476 --> 00:10:44,275
Not really.

177
00:10:44,277 --> 00:10:46,111
Sheila over there
can be quite mean,

178
00:10:46,113 --> 00:10:49,814
but that's because
everyone talks to her.

179
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:50,649
I understand.

180
00:10:50,651 --> 00:10:52,083
She's very pretty.

181
00:10:53,320 --> 00:10:54,320
Okay, um,

182
00:10:56,023 --> 00:10:57,789
maybe you can help
me out by telling me

183
00:10:57,791 --> 00:10:59,290
where the cigarettes are?

184
00:10:59,292 --> 00:11:02,027
Oh that's easy, the cigarettes
are always by the counter.

185
00:11:02,029 --> 00:11:04,829
(humming engine)

186
00:11:07,367 --> 00:11:08,367
Great.

187
00:11:16,143 --> 00:11:19,577
(gentle orchestral music)

188
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:33,725
Don't you wish people
picked up after themselves?

189
00:11:33,727 --> 00:11:37,896
I guess that means you
wouldn't have a job then.

190
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:39,230
How are you, Melinda?

191
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:40,532
Everything good tonight?

192
00:11:40,534 --> 00:11:42,801
Yeah, everything's good.

193
00:11:44,671 --> 00:11:46,404
Is that your new car?

194
00:11:48,508 --> 00:11:50,341
Yes it is.

195
00:11:50,343 --> 00:11:52,711
It's my first night going solo.

196
00:11:52,713 --> 00:11:54,546
Does that make you nervous?

197
00:11:54,548 --> 00:11:58,216
No, I've been training
for this for a long time.

198
00:11:58,218 --> 00:12:00,685
Feels great being by myself.

199
00:12:00,687 --> 00:12:03,054
[Melinda] Looks powerful.

200
00:12:04,925 --> 00:12:06,491
Do you need help?

201
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:09,060
No.

202
00:12:09,062 --> 00:12:12,230
Zero to 60 in 5.3 seconds.

203
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:13,232
Wow.

204
00:12:14,568 --> 00:12:18,203
The back of it kind of looks
like a robot with sunglasses.

205
00:12:18,205 --> 00:12:20,872
No I'm uh, just
looking for condoms.

206
00:12:20,874 --> 00:12:22,207
Really?

207
00:12:22,209 --> 00:12:23,541
You've been looking
for like five minutes,

208
00:12:23,543 --> 00:12:25,677
do you need me to
assist you with that?

209
00:12:25,679 --> 00:12:30,448
Can't imagine how
you could. (chuckles)

210
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:32,550
Are the windows bullet proof?

211
00:12:32,552 --> 00:12:34,519
Like, if bad guys
were shooting at you,

212
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:36,855
would the bullets
just bounce off?

213
00:12:36,857 --> 00:12:38,490
No, they'd hit me.

214
00:12:40,794 --> 00:12:42,127
I can take my break right now.

215
00:12:42,129 --> 00:12:44,262
Can you take me for a ride?

216
00:12:53,273 --> 00:12:55,540
Here, these should work.

217
00:12:56,476 --> 00:12:57,475
Yeah.

218
00:12:57,477 --> 00:13:00,278
I'll ring you
up at the counter.

219
00:13:00,280 --> 00:13:04,115
It's amazing,
it's like an office.

220
00:13:04,117 --> 00:13:05,150
Yeah, it is.

221
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:08,620
This is one of the newer models.

222
00:13:08,622 --> 00:13:09,721
What about the parking lot,

223
00:13:09,723 --> 00:13:12,123
can we just go around
the parking lot?

224
00:13:12,125 --> 00:13:16,594
I wish I could, but I really
need to stay on schedule.

225
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:18,296
Maybe I could get
arrested and then you could

226
00:13:18,298 --> 00:13:21,232
take me on a ride
and do your job.

227
00:13:21,234 --> 00:13:23,368
What if I took this?
- No!

228
00:13:26,273 --> 00:13:27,273
I'm sorry.

229
00:13:29,609 --> 00:13:32,177
I'll take you on a ride later.

230
00:13:32,179 --> 00:13:33,845
I promise.

231
00:13:33,847 --> 00:13:38,183
I'm gonna go get a
coffee, stay on schedule.

232
00:13:38,185 --> 00:13:39,350
Okay.

233
00:13:39,352 --> 00:13:42,687
(beeping register keys)
(doorbell rings)

234
00:13:42,689 --> 00:13:43,822
Hi Sheila.

235
00:13:43,824 --> 00:13:45,490
Hi Officer Lou.

236
00:13:45,492 --> 00:13:46,658
That's $9.45.

237
00:13:49,262 --> 00:13:52,831
Hey you know what,
uh, keep the change.

238
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,266
You sure?

239
00:13:55,268 --> 00:13:58,002
I believe in karma.

240
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,871
So is there a
bathroom I could use?

241
00:13:59,873 --> 00:14:02,173
Yeah, right around the corner.

242
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:03,274
[Man] All right.

243
00:14:03,276 --> 00:14:04,876
(doorbell rings)

244
00:14:04,878 --> 00:14:07,879
(dribbling coffee)

245
00:14:11,117 --> 00:14:13,351
How's everything tonight?

246
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:15,286
Ready to go home, but I can't

247
00:14:15,288 --> 00:14:17,889
because Perry's being
an asshole right now.

248
00:14:17,891 --> 00:14:20,959
He just does not care that
he's late everywhere he goes.

249
00:14:20,961 --> 00:14:22,527
I'm sorry to hear that.

250
00:14:22,529 --> 00:14:26,130
(laughing) This cracks me up.

251
00:14:26,132 --> 00:14:29,834
Fast action, extra
stimulating sex enhancements,

252
00:14:29,836 --> 00:14:32,303
100% guaranteed.

253
00:14:32,305 --> 00:14:35,306
[Sheila] It's always about
sex with you boys, isn't it?

254
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,075
Oh I, no, I don't,

255
00:14:37,077 --> 00:14:39,143
no, it's not me.

256
00:14:39,145 --> 00:14:43,081
Oh, I see, you've
never had that problem.

257
00:14:43,083 --> 00:14:46,084
[Officer Lou] No, no.

258
00:14:46,086 --> 00:14:47,385
Melinda, what the
hell are you doing?

259
00:14:47,387 --> 00:14:49,420
(clatters)

260
00:14:49,422 --> 00:14:51,756
Were you just taking
pictures of us?

261
00:14:51,758 --> 00:14:53,024
I wasn't.

262
00:14:53,026 --> 00:14:54,025
[Sheila] Officer Lou
is a police officer...

263
00:14:54,027 --> 00:14:55,059
I wasn't.

264
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:56,694
That's so inappropriate.

265
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:59,664
Sheila, Sheila,
it's okay, relax.

266
00:15:01,902 --> 00:15:04,869
Is your phone all
right, Melinda?

267
00:15:04,871 --> 00:15:07,872
[Sheila] Melinda,
show us your phone.

268
00:15:07,874 --> 00:15:09,741
Oh, that's not good.

269
00:15:13,713 --> 00:15:16,714
I broke my screen as well.

270
00:15:16,716 --> 00:15:19,217
[Radio] Attention all units,
we have a 503 in progress.

271
00:15:19,219 --> 00:15:21,586
Suspect, white male,
he may be armed,

272
00:15:21,588 --> 00:15:25,456
last seen in a gray sedan
driving south on 93.

273
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:26,524
That's me.

274
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:30,561
Sorry about your phone, Melinda.

275
00:15:30,563 --> 00:15:31,629
I gotta run.

276
00:15:34,200 --> 00:15:38,503
(doorbell rings)
- You are so creepy.

277
00:15:39,973 --> 00:15:42,307
Who else do you take pictures
of when they're not looking?

278
00:15:42,309 --> 00:15:45,276
Do you take pictures of me?

279
00:15:45,278 --> 00:15:48,546
Give me your phone,
Melinda or I'll report you

280
00:15:48,548 --> 00:15:50,148
and you'll lose your job.

281
00:15:50,150 --> 00:15:51,950
Show me your phone.

282
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:55,420
I wasn't taking
pictures of you.

283
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:57,322
Oh, just Officer Lou?

284
00:15:57,324 --> 00:16:00,124
That's fucking creepy, he
probably thinks you're so weird.

285
00:16:00,126 --> 00:16:01,225
I would.

286
00:16:02,329 --> 00:16:04,128
(laughing) Oh.

287
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:08,166
Oh my god, you have an
entire album for him?

288
00:16:08,168 --> 00:16:09,968
What do you do?

289
00:16:09,970 --> 00:16:13,604
Do you go home and rub yourself
looking at pictures of him?

290
00:16:13,606 --> 00:16:15,239
Officer Lou?

291
00:16:15,241 --> 00:16:19,143
Don't tell me you're some
kind of weird virgin.

292
00:16:19,145 --> 00:16:21,179
Stop it, Sheila.

293
00:16:21,181 --> 00:16:24,082
Oh my god, are you
holding out or something

294
00:16:24,084 --> 00:16:25,850
cause I'm sure one of
these truckers out here

295
00:16:25,852 --> 00:16:28,519
will bang you in the
bathroom if you ask them to.

296
00:16:28,521 --> 00:16:32,123
I can probably set
something up for you.

297
00:16:32,125 --> 00:16:33,491
(crying) You sick bitch.

298
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,526
Uh, did you just hit me?

299
00:16:35,528 --> 00:16:39,230
(somber orchestral music)

300
00:16:50,210 --> 00:16:53,111
(running water)

301
00:16:58,985 --> 00:17:00,718
[Man] Hi Melinda.

302
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:03,221
Don't be afraid, okay?

303
00:17:03,223 --> 00:17:04,555
I was just in the middle of
explaining to your friend,

304
00:17:04,557 --> 00:17:08,493
Sheila here that I am
not here to hurt anybody.

305
00:17:08,495 --> 00:17:10,728
That's not why I'm here,

306
00:17:10,730 --> 00:17:13,064
but I do need your cooperation.

307
00:17:13,066 --> 00:17:16,067
Can you follow some
simple instructions?

308
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:17,069
Yes, great.

309
00:17:18,204 --> 00:17:19,370
Would you mind going over there

310
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:20,805
and standing next to
your friend, Sheila?

311
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,540
She's not my friend.

312
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:26,144
[Man] Okay, regardless,
get over there.

313
00:17:30,917 --> 00:17:33,217
Where the hell were you?

314
00:17:33,219 --> 00:17:34,719
I'm not even
supposed to be here.

315
00:17:34,721 --> 00:17:35,721
Hey!

316
00:17:37,023 --> 00:17:40,858
Okay, now listen, no one is
going to be getting hurt,

317
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:41,692
all right?

318
00:17:41,694 --> 00:17:43,261
I am not some evil criminal.

319
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:47,231
Do I look like some
evil criminal, Melinda?

320
00:17:47,233 --> 00:17:48,366
No, great.

321
00:17:48,368 --> 00:17:50,568
I am just in a
little bit of trouble

322
00:17:50,570 --> 00:17:52,336
and I know that it's
not your guy's fault,

323
00:17:52,338 --> 00:17:54,939
however, I will be
needing your cooperation.

324
00:17:54,941 --> 00:17:56,274
When this is all said and done,

325
00:17:56,276 --> 00:17:59,110
you are going to have one
hell of a story to tell.

326
00:17:59,112 --> 00:18:01,446
There are some very
unreasonable people

327
00:18:01,448 --> 00:18:03,181
who are trying to kill me

328
00:18:03,183 --> 00:18:06,217
and it wasn't even
my fucking fault.

329
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:08,953
I did lose my
temper, but anyways,

330
00:18:08,955 --> 00:18:11,622
I'm sure that you ladies
wouldn't want a face like this

331
00:18:11,624 --> 00:18:14,058
going to waste on a dead man.

332
00:18:14,060 --> 00:18:15,193
Right, Melinda?

333
00:18:15,195 --> 00:18:17,195
Can you hurry up?

334
00:18:17,197 --> 00:18:18,029
You're robbing us, right?

335
00:18:18,031 --> 00:18:20,098
That's what's happening?

336
00:18:22,035 --> 00:18:25,069
You need to calm
the fuck down.

337
00:18:25,071 --> 00:18:26,071
Okay, now,

338
00:18:27,373 --> 00:18:30,408
neither of you two ladies own
this gas station, correct?

339
00:18:30,410 --> 00:18:31,410
No.

340
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:34,445
No.

341
00:18:34,447 --> 00:18:35,980
That's great news.

342
00:18:35,982 --> 00:18:38,883
That's great news, cause you
know why, this is not personal.

343
00:18:38,885 --> 00:18:41,486
Okay, I'm not robbing you
guys, it's not your money.

344
00:18:41,488 --> 00:18:43,387
Everything inside
both the registers

345
00:18:43,389 --> 00:18:45,156
and everything in the safe.

346
00:18:45,158 --> 00:18:48,226
Well, we don't have
the keys to the safe.

347
00:18:48,228 --> 00:18:50,495
Only the managers do.

348
00:18:50,497 --> 00:18:53,498
(sighing) Fuck.

349
00:18:53,500 --> 00:18:57,168
Okay, then just give me
everything in the registers.

350
00:18:57,170 --> 00:18:59,170
It's less than $100.

351
00:18:59,172 --> 00:19:01,339
People really don't
pay with cash anymore.

352
00:19:01,341 --> 00:19:02,974
Well, except you.

353
00:19:04,911 --> 00:19:07,945
Here, you want your change back?

354
00:19:07,947 --> 00:19:09,981
You're really being
a buzz kill, Sheila.

355
00:19:09,983 --> 00:19:14,152
Well, you're the genius
trying to rob a gas station.

356
00:19:14,154 --> 00:19:15,953
Is that thing even real?

357
00:19:15,955 --> 00:19:17,355
(fires gun)

358
00:19:17,357 --> 00:19:18,589
Fucking asshole.

359
00:19:18,591 --> 00:19:19,457
Shut the fuck up!

360
00:19:19,459 --> 00:19:20,958
Okay?

361
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:22,126
Melinda, could you please
tell your friend here

362
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:23,661
to quit being so
fucking difficult?

363
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,164
She's not my friend.

364
00:19:26,166 --> 00:19:28,432
Sheila, stop being
so fucking difficult.

365
00:19:28,434 --> 00:19:29,767
Hey, fuck you.

366
00:19:29,769 --> 00:19:32,303
Okay, that's enough, all
right, here, thank you.

367
00:19:32,305 --> 00:19:34,338
Money, bag, let's go.

368
00:19:35,875 --> 00:19:39,810
What are you gonna
do with the money?

369
00:19:39,812 --> 00:19:42,180
I am going to
go pay off my debt

370
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:44,749
to these fucking stupid bikers.

371
00:19:46,519 --> 00:19:49,487
Is this gonna be enough?

372
00:19:49,489 --> 00:19:51,222
No, apparently not.

373
00:19:52,859 --> 00:19:53,991
There's more
money in the safe.

374
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,193
I can get it for you.

375
00:19:55,195 --> 00:19:56,561
You're gonna
help this asshole?

376
00:19:56,563 --> 00:19:58,196
Sheila, he has a gun.

377
00:19:58,198 --> 00:20:00,231
I have a gun.

378
00:20:00,233 --> 00:20:02,700
I'll go get it.

379
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,435
How much do you need?

380
00:20:05,705 --> 00:20:07,638
All of it.

381
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:08,640
Okay.

382
00:20:15,148 --> 00:20:18,816
(clicks)
(beeping)

383
00:20:18,818 --> 00:20:22,386
(energetic rhythmic music)

384
00:20:26,659 --> 00:20:29,760
Shouldn't you be wearing
a mask or something?

385
00:20:29,762 --> 00:20:31,495
(doorbell rings)

386
00:20:31,497 --> 00:20:32,497
Uh oh.

387
00:20:37,170 --> 00:20:39,103
(whispers) Don't
you fuck around.

388
00:20:39,105 --> 00:20:40,504
Okay, I need this money.

389
00:20:40,506 --> 00:20:41,539
If I don't get it, I'll
kill everybody in the store.

390
00:20:41,541 --> 00:20:43,774
I don't give a shit,
you understand?

391
00:20:43,776 --> 00:20:44,742
Hey.

392
00:20:44,744 --> 00:20:46,410
Yes, okay, got it.

393
00:20:47,447 --> 00:20:51,949
(soft suspenseful
orchestral music)

394
00:21:19,212 --> 00:21:20,611
- Evening.
- Hi.

395
00:21:26,052 --> 00:21:31,122
(sniffs)
(suspenseful orchestral music)

396
00:21:38,264 --> 00:21:39,730
That's $12.45.

397
00:21:43,269 --> 00:21:45,303
(crinkling bill)

398
00:21:45,305 --> 00:21:46,971
(sighs)

399
00:21:46,973 --> 00:21:49,440
(rattles)

400
00:21:49,442 --> 00:21:53,144
Oh, we actually don't
have any change right now.

401
00:21:53,146 --> 00:21:55,579
You don't have
any change for a 20?

402
00:21:55,581 --> 00:21:59,283
We just counted the register
with the new shift person.

403
00:21:59,285 --> 00:22:01,152
Can you ring me over here?

404
00:22:01,154 --> 00:22:04,288
That register's
not open right now.

405
00:22:04,290 --> 00:22:07,191
Sorry, it's a really
weird situation.

406
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:09,794
Credit card, is that good?

407
00:22:09,796 --> 00:22:12,263
- [Sheila] Yeah.
- All right.

408
00:22:12,265 --> 00:22:13,864
Do you know how to get
to Wrightwood from here?

409
00:22:13,866 --> 00:22:15,499
There's no service.

410
00:22:15,501 --> 00:22:16,500
It's a few miles, right?
- [Sheila] Yeah,

411
00:22:16,502 --> 00:22:17,702
it's just a few miles down.

412
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:20,171
Hop on 18, right,
it's only a few miles?

413
00:22:20,173 --> 00:22:25,276
Yeah you just, um
(conversation fades).

414
00:22:28,781 --> 00:22:31,682
Just a couple of
miles down here.

415
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:35,619
(suspenseful orchestral music)

416
00:22:36,989 --> 00:22:38,489
(crinkles)

417
00:22:38,491 --> 00:22:40,224
Where were you trying to go?

418
00:22:40,226 --> 00:22:41,158
[Customer] Wrightwood.

419
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:42,727
Oh, Wrightwood is simple.

420
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:44,562
Just get on the 18 east
and you'll be there

421
00:22:44,564 --> 00:22:46,897
in about 12 miles,
you can't miss it.

422
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:49,700
All right, thank you.

423
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,135
Come on, let's go.

424
00:22:55,208 --> 00:22:58,309
(doorbell rings)

425
00:22:58,311 --> 00:22:59,977
What was that?

426
00:22:59,979 --> 00:23:01,846
I have the money
all ready to go.

427
00:23:01,848 --> 00:23:03,914
(sighing) Thank you.

428
00:23:03,916 --> 00:23:08,986
Melinda, you're an angel, thank
you for making this so easy.

429
00:23:11,858 --> 00:23:14,191
Can I have the backpack?

430
00:23:14,193 --> 00:23:17,061
Where are you
headed to after this?

431
00:23:17,063 --> 00:23:18,763
I'm gonna go pay off my debt

432
00:23:18,765 --> 00:23:21,532
and then get the hell out of
wherever the hell this is.

433
00:23:21,534 --> 00:23:24,001
Can I go with you?

434
00:23:24,003 --> 00:23:25,069
What?

435
00:23:25,071 --> 00:23:28,239
Can you take me
with you, please?

436
00:23:28,241 --> 00:23:29,940
Are you out of your mind?

437
00:23:29,942 --> 00:23:32,042
[Man] (laughs)
Melinda, come on.

438
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:33,244
You know what, you should go.

439
00:23:33,246 --> 00:23:34,745
- No, no...
- You two belong together.

440
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,947
Come on, come on, Melinda.

441
00:23:36,949 --> 00:23:38,749
Are you being serious?

442
00:23:38,751 --> 00:23:39,751
Yes.

443
00:23:41,387 --> 00:23:43,687
Melinda, just give me
the backpack, please.

444
00:23:43,689 --> 00:23:46,223
Take me with you, I'd
like to go with you.

445
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:48,626
No, that, that's
not gonna happen.

446
00:23:48,628 --> 00:23:51,362
Okay, just give me
the fucking backpack.

447
00:23:51,364 --> 00:23:54,031
You don't want to
get involved in this.

448
00:23:54,033 --> 00:23:56,066
I do want to get involved.

449
00:23:56,068 --> 00:23:57,868
I can be useful.

450
00:23:57,870 --> 00:24:00,438
Melinda, I have no
use for you, okay?

451
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,541
Give me the fucking money.

452
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:06,110
You do have use for me.

453
00:24:06,112 --> 00:24:07,645
I just got you the
money from the safe.

454
00:24:07,647 --> 00:24:09,246
You wouldn't have
gotten that without me.

455
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:10,781
Yes, and I appreciate that,

456
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,216
but Melinda, I don't
have time for this.

457
00:24:12,218 --> 00:24:13,250
Give me the fucking backpack.

458
00:24:13,252 --> 00:24:14,084
Melinda, just
give him the back...

459
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:15,286
Stop.

460
00:24:15,288 --> 00:24:16,153
Melinda, give him
the fucking backpack.

461
00:24:16,155 --> 00:24:17,254
Give me the goddamn backpack.

462
00:24:17,256 --> 00:24:20,257
Melinda give it.
(rustling)

463
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:22,326
(sighs)

464
00:24:24,497 --> 00:24:27,498
God, you are such
a little bitch.

465
00:24:29,135 --> 00:24:31,001
Yeah, you're just a
little bitch with a gun,

466
00:24:31,003 --> 00:24:32,837
bullying two girls.

467
00:24:32,839 --> 00:24:34,171
You call yourself a man?

468
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:36,574
When did I ever
say that I was a man?

469
00:24:36,576 --> 00:24:39,009
Oh good, cause you're not.

470
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:40,311
You know what your
fucking problem is?

471
00:24:40,313 --> 00:24:41,445
You don't know when
to shut the fuck up.

472
00:24:41,447 --> 00:24:42,413
Yeah, you think
I'm scared of you?

473
00:24:42,415 --> 00:24:44,181
Shut your fucking mouth.

474
00:24:44,183 --> 00:24:46,183
I'm not trying to be
tough, I was nice to you.

475
00:24:46,185 --> 00:24:47,418
What are you gonna shoot me?

476
00:24:47,420 --> 00:24:48,786
Why are you being
so fucking difficult?

477
00:24:48,788 --> 00:24:50,788
You're lucky my boyfriend
isn't here right now.

478
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:51,655
Oh wow, am I?

479
00:24:51,657 --> 00:24:52,456
Yeah, the fucking boyfriend...

480
00:24:52,458 --> 00:24:53,524
Yeah, he's got guns too,

481
00:24:53,526 --> 00:24:55,192
definitely has a
bigger dick than you.

482
00:24:55,194 --> 00:24:57,261
Why the fuck are we talking
about your boyfriend's dick?

483
00:24:57,263 --> 00:24:58,028
You're not tough.

484
00:24:58,030 --> 00:24:58,863
You want to see tough?

485
00:24:58,865 --> 00:25:00,197
I can...
- Take your money

486
00:25:00,199 --> 00:25:03,434
and get the fuck outta
here, like a little bitch.

487
00:25:03,436 --> 00:25:06,437
(scuffling)
(screams)

488
00:25:06,439 --> 00:25:07,505
I fucking told you!

489
00:25:07,507 --> 00:25:08,305
I told you!

490
00:25:08,307 --> 00:25:09,840
You made this happen!

491
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:12,343
I was trying to be nice and
you wouldn't shut the fuck up!

492
00:25:12,345 --> 00:25:14,278
Melinda, lock the door.

493
00:25:14,280 --> 00:25:16,780
Lock the fucking door, Melinda.

494
00:25:16,782 --> 00:25:18,983
You need to learn how to
fucking talk to people.

495
00:25:18,985 --> 00:25:20,217
I would have been out of her

496
00:25:20,219 --> 00:25:22,052
if you would have shut
your dumb fucking mouth!

497
00:25:22,054 --> 00:25:23,120
Give me your phone, Melinda.

498
00:25:23,122 --> 00:25:24,188
Shh.

499
00:25:26,826 --> 00:25:30,461
Go in the bathroom til
I tell you to come out.

500
00:25:30,463 --> 00:25:31,795
You know what?

501
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:32,496
I'm gonna fucking teach
you how to talk to people.

502
00:25:32,498 --> 00:25:33,464
Get up.

503
00:25:33,466 --> 00:25:35,533
Get the fuck up, get up.

504
00:25:40,039 --> 00:25:41,138
Come on.

505
00:25:42,074 --> 00:25:44,542
(pounds)

506
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:47,344
(yells)

507
00:25:47,346 --> 00:25:48,646
(door slams)

508
00:25:48,648 --> 00:25:51,181
(muffled talking)
Get on your knees.

509
00:25:51,183 --> 00:25:53,250
(slams)

510
00:25:55,388 --> 00:25:59,089
(muffled arguing)

511
00:25:59,091 --> 00:26:00,925
(door closes)

512
00:26:00,927 --> 00:26:03,761
(muffled arguing)

513
00:26:06,933 --> 00:26:10,734
(energetic orchestral music)

514
00:26:47,073 --> 00:26:49,306
(dribbling)

515
00:27:00,152 --> 00:27:03,287
(muffled arguing)

516
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:08,325
- Now fuck you!
- [Sheila] Get off me!

517
00:27:08,327 --> 00:27:10,227
- Dumb ass!
- [Sheila] Fuck you!

518
00:27:10,229 --> 00:27:11,428
I told you to wait in
the fucking bathroom!

519
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,731
(splashing)
(screams)

520
00:27:13,733 --> 00:27:18,802
(groaning)
(menacing orchestral music)

521
00:27:22,975 --> 00:27:23,974
(clanks)
(grunts)

522
00:27:23,976 --> 00:27:27,578
(menacing orchestral music)

523
00:27:48,167 --> 00:27:50,334
(swishing)

524
00:27:55,207 --> 00:27:57,441
(shallow breathing)

525
00:27:57,443 --> 00:27:59,276
(painful swallow)

526
00:27:59,278 --> 00:28:03,681
(whooshing)
(groaning)

527
00:28:03,683 --> 00:28:06,316
(clanks)

528
00:28:06,318 --> 00:28:11,355
(crinkling)
(shallow breathing)

529
00:28:18,364 --> 00:28:21,699
Melinda, Melinda
you're stupid.

530
00:28:21,701 --> 00:28:23,400
Stupid idiot.

531
00:28:23,402 --> 00:28:26,403
(pained breathing)

532
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:33,877
(swishing)
Fuck.

533
00:28:33,879 --> 00:28:37,014
(grunting)

534
00:28:37,016 --> 00:28:40,084
(labored breathing)

535
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:49,426
I wasn't going to shoot her.

536
00:28:51,897 --> 00:28:54,665
You can clean up all
you fucking want,

537
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:56,300
but it's your fault.

538
00:28:58,571 --> 00:29:00,938
(grunting)

539
00:29:05,077 --> 00:29:07,444
Why are you cleaning it up?

540
00:29:09,281 --> 00:29:10,281
Huh?

541
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:13,751
What are you going to tell
some bullshit story to the cops

542
00:29:13,753 --> 00:29:16,019
when they get here?

543
00:29:16,021 --> 00:29:18,055
(shallow breathing)

544
00:29:18,057 --> 00:29:20,257
(grunts)

545
00:29:26,198 --> 00:29:28,899
I wasn't going to shoot her.

546
00:29:28,901 --> 00:29:30,367
I'm not a murderer.

547
00:29:32,304 --> 00:29:34,471
(grunts)

548
00:29:35,875 --> 00:29:37,074
All right, what are you
going to tell the cops

549
00:29:37,076 --> 00:29:38,609
when they get here?

550
00:29:40,045 --> 00:29:42,146
Fuck, did you throw
hot coffee on my face?

551
00:29:42,148 --> 00:29:44,181
It's fucking on fire.

552
00:29:45,885 --> 00:29:46,917
God.

553
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:49,987
(labored breathing)

554
00:29:51,390 --> 00:29:54,825
What, what the fuck
are you looking at?

555
00:29:54,827 --> 00:29:56,760
Just looking at your face.

556
00:29:56,762 --> 00:29:58,262
Yeah?

557
00:29:58,264 --> 00:30:02,499
Yeah, well I'm sure it looks
pretty fucked up, thank you.

558
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:06,003
Why didn't you want
me to go with you?

559
00:30:06,939 --> 00:30:08,405
What?

560
00:30:08,407 --> 00:30:11,108
When I asked to
leave with you,

561
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:13,577
why didn't you want
me to come with you?

562
00:30:13,579 --> 00:30:14,579
Why?

563
00:30:16,248 --> 00:30:18,849
That's fucking crazy.

564
00:30:18,851 --> 00:30:20,684
I don't know you.

565
00:30:20,686 --> 00:30:23,353
There's no reason for
you to get involved.

566
00:30:23,355 --> 00:30:27,324
This didn't have to
be this complicated.

567
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:29,026
I didn't think
Sheila would get shot.

568
00:30:29,028 --> 00:30:31,028
That wasn't what I wanted.

569
00:30:31,030 --> 00:30:32,963
Well you made it happen.

570
00:30:32,965 --> 00:30:35,165
(panicky breathing)

571
00:30:35,167 --> 00:30:38,101
Okay, Melinda seriously,

572
00:30:38,103 --> 00:30:39,536
you gotta let me outta here.

573
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:41,438
Okay, I'm not gonna hurt you.

574
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,140
Okay, I just need to
give them their money

575
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:45,175
or else they're
going to kill me.

576
00:30:45,177 --> 00:30:47,144
Who's gonna kill you?

577
00:30:47,146 --> 00:30:48,378
(stuttering) The bikers.

578
00:30:48,380 --> 00:30:52,015
The fucking clown
stupid assholes

579
00:30:52,017 --> 00:30:56,053
who care too much about
their dumb motorcycles.

580
00:30:56,055 --> 00:30:58,355
(sighing)

581
00:30:58,357 --> 00:31:00,057
Okay, well they know that
I'm robbing this place

582
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:01,191
and if I don't give
them their money,

583
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:04,895
they're gonna come
here looking for me.

584
00:31:04,897 --> 00:31:08,866
Well, why didn't you
just leave with me then?

585
00:31:12,304 --> 00:31:15,739
You haven't called
the cops, have you?

586
00:31:20,079 --> 00:31:21,411
What's your plan?

587
00:31:22,414 --> 00:31:23,814
I'm not sure.

588
00:31:26,986 --> 00:31:28,418
Listen, Melinda,

589
00:31:29,922 --> 00:31:33,590
you and I are in a lot
of trouble right now.

590
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:37,995
At this point,
you're my accomplice.

591
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:41,164
You helped me get the money.

592
00:31:41,166 --> 00:31:46,403
Because you threw hot coffee
on my face, Sheila is dead.

593
00:31:46,405 --> 00:31:48,238
And at some point,

594
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,041
someone's gonna figure
out that Sheila's dead,

595
00:31:51,043 --> 00:31:53,911
so let's get out of here
while we still can together.

596
00:31:53,913 --> 00:31:56,580
Look, I know I can trust you now

597
00:31:57,549 --> 00:31:59,883
because we're on the same team.

598
00:31:59,885 --> 00:32:03,120
But I was always on your team.

599
00:32:03,122 --> 00:32:06,690
I got you the money
from the safe.

600
00:32:06,692 --> 00:32:08,025
You're right.

601
00:32:11,797 --> 00:32:15,265
I just didn't want
you to get in trouble.

602
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,366
I didn't want you to get hurt.

603
00:32:16,368 --> 00:32:19,169
I didn't want
anybody to get hurt.

604
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:22,139
Except Sheila.

605
00:32:22,141 --> 00:32:23,473
No.

606
00:32:23,475 --> 00:32:25,742
Instead of leaving with
me, you decided to stay

607
00:32:25,744 --> 00:32:27,044
and try to have sex with her.

608
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:30,147
I wasn't trying to
have sex with Sheila.

609
00:32:30,149 --> 00:32:33,050
Melinda, I lost my temper.

610
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:35,285
Okay, it's a problem that I have

611
00:32:35,287 --> 00:32:38,655
and it's something
that I'm working on,

612
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,325
but what were you gonna do?

613
00:32:41,327 --> 00:32:43,560
What, you gonna come with me?

614
00:32:43,562 --> 00:32:45,295
To deliver the money?

615
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:48,932
I mean, come on, if those guys,

616
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:51,768
if they saw you, a pretty,
pretty girl like you,

617
00:32:51,770 --> 00:32:53,670
with me, they could
have murdered you.

618
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:56,440
They could have raped you,
just to get back at me.

619
00:32:56,442 --> 00:32:58,575
I didn't want that, okay?

620
00:33:08,253 --> 00:33:12,255
I mean I guess, also
why I didn't say yes was

621
00:33:13,192 --> 00:33:15,192
I didn't believe you.

622
00:33:16,462 --> 00:33:18,428
Believe what?

623
00:33:18,430 --> 00:33:22,966
Believe that you'd actually
want to leave with me.

624
00:33:22,968 --> 00:33:25,836
I wasn't lying to you.

625
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:26,838
No.

626
00:33:27,873 --> 00:33:30,874
Yeah, no, I believe you now.

627
00:33:30,876 --> 00:33:32,609
It's just, it didn't make
sense to me at the time,

628
00:33:32,611 --> 00:33:35,112
why you'd want to
come away with me.

629
00:33:35,114 --> 00:33:38,015
I'm breaking the law
because I have to.

630
00:33:38,017 --> 00:33:41,351
I don't want to be
doing this, okay?

631
00:33:41,353 --> 00:33:44,221
And it didn't make sense
to me that someone like you

632
00:33:44,223 --> 00:33:45,856
would want to just
throw their life away

633
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:48,158
and take off with a
stranger with a gun.

634
00:33:48,160 --> 00:33:53,330
I mean, I know I'm
handsome, but (laughs).

635
00:33:53,332 --> 00:33:55,632
Unless, you were just planning

636
00:33:55,634 --> 00:33:57,067
on robbing the place yourself.

637
00:33:57,069 --> 00:34:02,139
(laughs) Or you're just
that unhappy with your life.

638
00:34:03,542 --> 00:34:04,542
Are you?

639
00:34:05,477 --> 00:34:08,979
Are you that unhappy
with your life?

640
00:34:08,981 --> 00:34:12,082
I mean you do work
at a gas station.

641
00:34:12,084 --> 00:34:15,052
There's nothing wrong with
working at a gas station.

642
00:34:15,054 --> 00:34:17,721
I meet a lot of
interesting people.

643
00:34:17,723 --> 00:34:20,524
Gas stations are community
gathering centers.

644
00:34:20,526 --> 00:34:21,425
Oh.

645
00:34:21,427 --> 00:34:22,726
There was this
famous architect

646
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:24,094
named Frank Lloyd Wright,

647
00:34:24,096 --> 00:34:26,496
everyone thought
he was a genius and

648
00:34:26,498 --> 00:34:28,732
he was obsessed
with gas stations.

649
00:34:28,734 --> 00:34:31,935
He even built this really
artistic one in Minnesota.

650
00:34:31,937 --> 00:34:34,438
He said in the future,
gas stations will be

651
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:37,674
where every town would
gather to socialize and talk

652
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:40,143
and get to know one another.

653
00:34:41,547 --> 00:34:43,914
I'm going to visit it one day.

654
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:46,049
Wow, that's very interesting.

655
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:48,585
I didn't think of it
that way, I guess, yeah.

656
00:34:48,587 --> 00:34:49,719
I mean on a busy shift,

657
00:34:49,721 --> 00:34:52,422
I usually meet
around 240 customers.

658
00:34:52,424 --> 00:34:53,790
Some of them are regulars,

659
00:34:53,792 --> 00:34:56,226
but I'm always
meeting new people,

660
00:34:56,228 --> 00:34:59,196
unless I work a graveyard
shift like tonight. (laughs)

661
00:34:59,198 --> 00:35:02,099
After midnight, I sometimes
only meet like 20 people.

662
00:35:02,101 --> 00:35:04,034
And then you meet
an asshole like me,

663
00:35:04,036 --> 00:35:07,037
(laughs)
but hey,

664
00:35:07,039 --> 00:35:08,839
I'm glad I met you.

665
00:35:10,375 --> 00:35:14,044
People don't usually give me
the chance to get to know me.

666
00:35:14,046 --> 00:35:16,146
They usually want to
get to know Sheila.

667
00:35:16,148 --> 00:35:20,150
(sighs) Fuck Sheila.

668
00:35:20,152 --> 00:35:22,085
Melinda, I've met
1000 girls like Sheila

669
00:35:22,087 --> 00:35:25,622
and there's nothing
special about her.

670
00:35:25,624 --> 00:35:27,157
But you, you and I?

671
00:35:28,760 --> 00:35:30,894
We're a lot alike.

672
00:35:30,896 --> 00:35:32,162
In a good way.

673
00:35:34,066 --> 00:35:35,999
We go for what we want.

674
00:35:39,238 --> 00:35:42,439
(sighing loudly)

675
00:35:42,441 --> 00:35:44,074
I would love a cigarette.

676
00:35:44,076 --> 00:35:45,809
Do you have a cigarette?

677
00:35:45,811 --> 00:35:46,811
Yeah.

678
00:35:52,518 --> 00:35:55,418
(flicks)

679
00:35:55,420 --> 00:35:57,020
(inhaling)

680
00:35:57,022 --> 00:35:59,523
(sighs) Thanks.

681
00:35:59,525 --> 00:36:00,590
(laughing) I still can't believe

682
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:03,426
you threw hot coffee in my face.

683
00:36:03,428 --> 00:36:05,695
Burns like hell.

684
00:36:05,697 --> 00:36:07,964
It's not a bad thing.

685
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:10,433
I burn myself all the time.

686
00:36:13,672 --> 00:36:14,922
See?

687
00:36:14,923 --> 00:36:16,173
You're just feeling
a quick change.

688
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:20,043
I know it hurts, but it
doesn't have to be a bad thing.

689
00:36:20,045 --> 00:36:23,113
Fire just forces things
to change really fast.

690
00:36:23,115 --> 00:36:25,448
Like when a forest burns down,

691
00:36:25,450 --> 00:36:28,785
it all just grows
back even better.

692
00:36:28,787 --> 00:36:30,687
And the fire was
just turning it back

693
00:36:30,689 --> 00:36:32,455
to what it used to be
in the first place.

694
00:36:32,457 --> 00:36:34,024
Okay, Melinda, you
know how (laughs)

695
00:36:34,026 --> 00:36:36,459
I really want to keep
talking with you,

696
00:36:36,461 --> 00:36:40,363
but I could use some
Advil or something.

697
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:42,098
If you wouldn't mind.

698
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:48,906
Hey.

699
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:54,411
I'm really sorry about all this.

700
00:36:55,347 --> 00:36:57,147
You deserve better.

701
00:36:58,250 --> 00:37:01,484
I wish I would have
just left with you.

702
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:08,592
(dramatic orchestral music)

703
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:17,901
(rattling)

704
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:22,973
(knocking)
(siren sounding)

705
00:37:26,245 --> 00:37:31,314
(dramatic orchestral music)
(rattling)

706
00:37:33,352 --> 00:37:35,919
(knocking)

707
00:37:35,921 --> 00:37:39,589
(dramatic orchestral music)

708
00:38:03,248 --> 00:38:06,750
(door closes)

709
00:38:06,752 --> 00:38:08,018
Oh, thank you.

710
00:38:10,956 --> 00:38:11,956
Mm, mmhmm.

711
00:38:14,993 --> 00:38:16,126
Thanks.

712
00:38:17,396 --> 00:38:19,496
Hey, you know what
I was thinking?

713
00:38:19,498 --> 00:38:22,132
I really want to go see
that gas station in Montana

714
00:38:22,134 --> 00:38:22,932
you were talking about.

715
00:38:22,934 --> 00:38:25,302
That sounds so cool.

716
00:38:25,304 --> 00:38:26,403
All right, once we
get out of town,

717
00:38:26,405 --> 00:38:28,672
that's the first
place we're gonna go.

718
00:38:28,674 --> 00:38:31,508
I want to leave with you, but

719
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:35,645
I just need to figure out
what to tell my boyfriend.

720
00:38:35,647 --> 00:38:37,981
You have a boyfriend?

721
00:38:37,983 --> 00:38:39,182
I do, yeah.

722
00:38:44,356 --> 00:38:48,191
Has he, will he be
worried about you or...

723
00:38:50,028 --> 00:38:51,161
Maybe.

724
00:38:52,164 --> 00:38:53,730
But I don't care.

725
00:38:55,033 --> 00:38:57,334
I want to leave with
you like you said.

726
00:38:57,336 --> 00:38:58,601
(sighs) Right,

727
00:38:58,603 --> 00:39:00,770
it just makes things a
lot more complicated.

728
00:39:00,772 --> 00:39:01,638
It's not that big of a deal,

729
00:39:01,640 --> 00:39:03,873
I don't really like him anyway.

730
00:39:03,875 --> 00:39:07,177
Okay, uh, okay yeah,
but how about this,

731
00:39:07,179 --> 00:39:10,146
how about I go alone
to give them the money

732
00:39:10,148 --> 00:39:12,849
and then you stay here
and you call the cops

733
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:15,118
and once they get here,
you can just tell them that

734
00:39:15,120 --> 00:39:17,987
somebody robbed the store
and then shot Sheila

735
00:39:17,989 --> 00:39:19,389
and then once that's all sorted,

736
00:39:19,391 --> 00:39:21,524
we'll meet back up and
then we'll get out of town

737
00:39:21,526 --> 00:39:25,061
before anybody
realized what happened.

738
00:39:25,063 --> 00:39:27,664
Don't you want to
leave together still?

739
00:39:27,666 --> 00:39:30,300
Yes, but you have a boyfriend.

740
00:39:31,536 --> 00:39:33,737
Is that gonna stop you?

741
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:35,238
No, but Melinda, (sighs)

742
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:37,173
it just makes things
really complicated

743
00:39:37,175 --> 00:39:39,209
for us to leave right now.

744
00:39:40,345 --> 00:39:42,078
Does it still hurt?

745
00:39:43,415 --> 00:39:48,485
Uh yeah, (laughs) yeah,
thanks for reminding me.

746
00:39:56,094 --> 00:39:58,762
Wa... (slurping)

747
00:39:59,931 --> 00:40:00,931
Thanks.

748
00:40:06,338 --> 00:40:08,304
Melinda, you know what?

749
00:40:09,775 --> 00:40:11,341
Look, if you really don't give
a fuck about your boyfriend,

750
00:40:11,343 --> 00:40:16,246
then let's do it, let's go,
but only if we do it right now.

751
00:40:17,416 --> 00:40:18,416
Okay?

752
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:23,019
Come on, (stuttering)
what are you doing?

753
00:40:23,021 --> 00:40:25,188
(sighs)

754
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:28,124
(pained breathing)

755
00:40:31,196 --> 00:40:32,196
Fuck.

756
00:40:32,964 --> 00:40:34,597
My heart.

757
00:40:34,599 --> 00:40:35,598
(grunts)

758
00:40:35,600 --> 00:40:36,866
Okay, Melinda,

759
00:40:38,103 --> 00:40:40,103
(shuffles)

760
00:40:40,105 --> 00:40:41,771
Did you fucking drug me?

761
00:40:41,773 --> 00:40:44,707
(nervous breathing)
Oh come on, Melinda.

762
00:40:44,709 --> 00:40:46,543
Stop fucking around,
okay, let's go.

763
00:40:46,545 --> 00:40:49,245
Let's get the fuck
out of here, please.

764
00:40:49,247 --> 00:40:51,381
(grunts)

765
00:40:53,385 --> 00:40:54,417
Oh no, no, no.

766
00:40:54,419 --> 00:40:56,219
Stop please, please
stop, please.

767
00:40:56,221 --> 00:41:00,023
No, what are you doing,
what are you doing?

768
00:41:01,059 --> 00:41:03,226
Oh. (nervous breathing)

769
00:41:03,228 --> 00:41:05,962
Look, we can do
this later, okay?

770
00:41:07,065 --> 00:41:09,532
Just, let's get out of here.

771
00:41:11,403 --> 00:41:14,304
I know you're lying to me.

772
00:41:14,306 --> 00:41:16,673
I know you don't like me.

773
00:41:16,675 --> 00:41:20,176
The second I untie you, I
know you're gonna kill me.

774
00:41:20,178 --> 00:41:22,345
I know this is all a lie.

775
00:41:25,750 --> 00:41:28,518
But I'm going to
be okay with it.

776
00:41:31,323 --> 00:41:35,124
(suspenseful orchestral music)

777
00:41:35,126 --> 00:41:37,160
(tearing)

778
00:41:41,967 --> 00:41:43,032
God, fuck!

779
00:41:44,302 --> 00:41:46,870
(mumbles) Fucking bitch.

780
00:41:46,872 --> 00:41:50,473
(muffled protests)

781
00:41:50,475 --> 00:41:54,110
(dramatic orchestral music)

782
00:41:59,718 --> 00:42:02,151
(clinking belt buckle)

783
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:04,087
(zips)

784
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:13,196
(panicked breathing)
(dramatic orchestral music)

785
00:42:39,024 --> 00:42:40,390
(grunting)

786
00:42:40,392 --> 00:42:41,724
(clatters)

787
00:42:41,726 --> 00:42:44,894
(muffled struggling)

788
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:54,737
(suspenseful orchestral music)

789
00:42:59,044 --> 00:43:01,077
(grunting)

790
00:43:01,079 --> 00:43:03,446
(clattering)

791
00:43:19,130 --> 00:43:21,464
(clattering)

792
00:43:46,391 --> 00:43:48,958
(thumps)

793
00:43:48,960 --> 00:43:51,227
(sliding)

794
00:43:54,432 --> 00:43:56,566
(thumps)

795
00:43:59,437 --> 00:44:03,072
(menacing orchestral music)

796
00:44:57,062 --> 00:44:59,429
(rattling)

797
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,900
(doorbell rings)
- Since when the hell

798
00:45:03,902 --> 00:45:05,668
do you all close at night?

799
00:45:05,670 --> 00:45:10,139
I've been out there 10
minutes banging on that door.

800
00:45:16,014 --> 00:45:18,247
(crinkling)

801
00:45:25,156 --> 00:45:28,191
Hey where's the regular coffee?

802
00:45:28,193 --> 00:45:30,827
We don't have any right now.

803
00:45:32,097 --> 00:45:34,864
[Customer] Don't
have any right now?

804
00:45:34,866 --> 00:45:36,833
You're a damn gas station.

805
00:45:36,835 --> 00:45:38,267
Can you make some?

806
00:45:39,604 --> 00:45:40,604
No.

807
00:45:41,773 --> 00:45:44,540
We have iced coffee and
energy drinks in the fridge.

808
00:45:44,542 --> 00:45:46,242
Energy drinks?

809
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:48,411
That's goddam ridiculous.

810
00:45:51,516 --> 00:45:52,782
No hot coffee.

811
00:45:54,085 --> 00:45:56,018
I can't have energy drinks.

812
00:45:56,020 --> 00:45:58,588
I can get a damn heart attack,

813
00:45:58,590 --> 00:46:01,290
lose control of the wheel,

814
00:46:01,292 --> 00:46:02,292
hit a bus.

815
00:46:03,928 --> 00:46:05,194
What the hell?

816
00:46:07,031 --> 00:46:09,532
I don't even know what
half this shit is.

817
00:46:09,534 --> 00:46:11,067
What ever happened to coffee?

818
00:46:11,069 --> 00:46:13,636
Why do we have to have choices?

819
00:46:14,773 --> 00:46:17,273
(crying)
This whole country,

820
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:21,477
this whole country is
going to hell in a handbag.

821
00:46:23,414 --> 00:46:27,283
(melancholy orchestral music)

822
00:46:31,055 --> 00:46:33,189
(crying)

823
00:46:38,263 --> 00:46:41,731
Look, I don't know
what your issue is,

824
00:46:43,968 --> 00:46:47,136
but I just want some coffee.

825
00:46:47,138 --> 00:46:48,771
Can I pay for this?

826
00:46:48,773 --> 00:46:52,008
(crying) Please just take
what you want and leave.

827
00:46:52,010 --> 00:46:54,076
Look, I'm not asking
for any handout.

828
00:46:54,078 --> 00:46:56,679
Please just leave me alone.

829
00:46:56,681 --> 00:46:58,848
(crying)

830
00:47:00,952 --> 00:47:04,821
(melancholy orchestral music)

831
00:47:10,361 --> 00:47:15,364
(doorbell rings)
(crying)

832
00:47:41,326 --> 00:47:43,593
(beeping)

833
00:47:47,665 --> 00:47:51,500
[Operator] Filson County,
911 where's your emergency?

834
00:47:51,502 --> 00:47:53,169
Hello?
(doorbell rings)

835
00:47:53,171 --> 00:47:56,839
This is a 911 operator...
- Hey, Melinda.

836
00:47:56,841 --> 00:47:58,407
What are you doing?

837
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:02,211
Where's Sheila at?

838
00:48:02,213 --> 00:48:04,180
She's not here.

839
00:48:04,182 --> 00:48:06,015
What do you mean
she's not here?

840
00:48:06,017 --> 00:48:07,483
What'd she leave already?

841
00:48:07,485 --> 00:48:09,652
She's not here anymore.

842
00:48:11,089 --> 00:48:13,189
Uh, what's the matter?

843
00:48:13,191 --> 00:48:14,191
Nothing.

844
00:48:16,427 --> 00:48:19,362
Trying to call her
for like an hour.

845
00:48:19,364 --> 00:48:21,998
She knew I was
picking her up, but

846
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:24,267
what, did she get a ride?

847
00:48:24,269 --> 00:48:27,403
Who the hell gave her a ride?

848
00:48:27,405 --> 00:48:28,537
I don't know, I didn't see.

849
00:48:28,539 --> 00:48:31,173
I just know she's gone.

850
00:48:31,175 --> 00:48:33,943
Well what did she say to you?

851
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:37,013
Well was she mad at me?

852
00:48:37,015 --> 00:48:40,449
I told her I was
finishing up at the shop.

853
00:48:41,386 --> 00:48:44,186
Dammit, she always
does this shit.

854
00:48:57,068 --> 00:49:00,303
If I see her,
I'll let you know.

855
00:49:00,305 --> 00:49:01,305
Yeah.

856
00:49:03,875 --> 00:49:06,142
(buzzing)

857
00:49:10,281 --> 00:49:11,480
What is that?

858
00:49:12,917 --> 00:49:13,917
Shh.

859
00:49:14,986 --> 00:49:19,455
(buzzing)
Is that her phone vibrating?

860
00:49:36,307 --> 00:49:39,508
What's her phone
doing on the ground?

861
00:49:41,980 --> 00:49:44,847
She can't go two minutes
without her phone.

862
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:46,282
Where is she?

863
00:49:46,284 --> 00:49:47,650
She still here?

864
00:49:47,652 --> 00:49:49,618
No, she left.

865
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:53,089
You're, you're not
lying to me, are you?

866
00:49:53,091 --> 00:49:56,859
She's not like in the bathroom
or in the back or something?

867
00:49:56,861 --> 00:49:59,028
Because if she left,
she's gonna realize

868
00:49:59,030 --> 00:50:01,030
that her phone is missing
in like two minutes

869
00:50:01,032 --> 00:50:02,631
and come back for it.

870
00:50:02,633 --> 00:50:04,000
Why do you keep crying?

871
00:50:04,002 --> 00:50:06,802
(crying) I'm sorry.

872
00:50:06,804 --> 00:50:11,974
Look, hey, hey hey, Melinda,
listen to me, it's okay.

873
00:50:11,976 --> 00:50:13,175
All right, this is my
girl we're talking about.

874
00:50:13,177 --> 00:50:16,045
All right, I just,
I don't give a shit.

875
00:50:16,047 --> 00:50:17,513
All right, if she's mad at me

876
00:50:17,515 --> 00:50:19,515
or if she got you to
lie for her, all right?

877
00:50:19,517 --> 00:50:21,117
I just need to know where she is

878
00:50:21,119 --> 00:50:22,885
all right, and that she's okay.

879
00:50:22,887 --> 00:50:23,953
That's all that matters
to me, all right?

880
00:50:23,955 --> 00:50:26,655
That's all I care about.

881
00:50:26,657 --> 00:50:27,657
Look, if

882
00:50:29,060 --> 00:50:33,195
if you're lying to me and
something happens to her,

883
00:50:34,165 --> 00:50:36,399
Melinda, I swear to god...

884
00:50:36,401 --> 00:50:37,401
She left

885
00:50:39,237 --> 00:50:40,970
with a guy.

886
00:50:40,972 --> 00:50:44,940
(chuckles) Shut up, a guy?

887
00:50:46,010 --> 00:50:47,843
What guy?

888
00:50:47,845 --> 00:50:51,013
I don't know, I'd
never seen him before.

889
00:50:51,015 --> 00:50:53,749
What do, what did,
what did he look like?

890
00:50:53,751 --> 00:50:57,053
Some guy, had like
a jean jacket on.

891
00:50:57,989 --> 00:51:00,322
Well, did she know him?

892
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:02,425
Were they like touchy
or something together?

893
00:51:02,427 --> 00:51:03,659
Yeah.

894
00:51:03,661 --> 00:51:05,061
I think they went to
a motel or something.

895
00:51:05,063 --> 00:51:06,063
A what?

896
00:51:10,001 --> 00:51:12,068
(sniffs)

897
00:51:12,070 --> 00:51:14,270
Uh, did you get his name?

898
00:51:15,506 --> 00:51:17,907
Was he named Devon,
was it Devon?

899
00:51:17,909 --> 00:51:19,842
I didn't hear it,
I'm really sorry.

900
00:51:19,844 --> 00:51:22,578
What motel did
they go to, Melinda?

901
00:51:22,580 --> 00:51:24,180
I don't know.

902
00:51:24,182 --> 00:51:27,349
Everything just
happened really fast.

903
00:51:34,092 --> 00:51:36,725
Okay, (clears throat) okay,

904
00:51:36,727 --> 00:51:40,296
I'm gonna, I'm gonna
go to the Motel 6,

905
00:51:40,298 --> 00:51:42,064
on the 18, all right?

906
00:51:42,066 --> 00:51:45,134
If she comes back for her
phone, you tell her I have it.

907
00:51:45,136 --> 00:51:47,770
All right, she better
wait here for me.

908
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:51,974
All right, do not let her
leave before I get back.

909
00:51:51,976 --> 00:51:53,209
Okay.

910
00:51:53,211 --> 00:51:56,946
All right, thanks for
telling me, Melinda.

911
00:52:02,487 --> 00:52:05,287
(doorbell rings)

912
00:52:10,394 --> 00:52:14,330
(suspenseful orchestral music)

913
00:52:22,073 --> 00:52:24,240
(clanks)

914
00:52:25,843 --> 00:52:26,742
(slams)

915
00:52:26,744 --> 00:52:30,579
(suspenseful orchestral music)

916
00:53:24,035 --> 00:53:27,069
(revving motorcycles)

917
00:53:39,183 --> 00:53:43,085
(menacing orchestral music)

918
00:53:51,162 --> 00:53:52,995
Can I help you guys?

919
00:53:54,432 --> 00:53:57,333
Yeah, we were thinking about
going in the store and uh,

920
00:53:57,335 --> 00:53:59,201
buying some things.

921
00:53:59,203 --> 00:54:01,036
I'm sorry, I'd really
like to help you guys,

922
00:54:01,038 --> 00:54:02,104
and normally I would,

923
00:54:02,106 --> 00:54:03,939
but right now, the
store is closed.

924
00:54:03,941 --> 00:54:07,276
[Man] The sign says 24 hours.

925
00:54:07,278 --> 00:54:08,278
Yes,

926
00:54:09,714 --> 00:54:11,847
but not today's 24 hours.

927
00:54:14,051 --> 00:54:15,951
Did something
happen here tonight?

928
00:54:15,953 --> 00:54:18,053
No, nothing happened.

929
00:54:18,055 --> 00:54:20,623
I'm just cleaning
up a little mess.

930
00:54:20,625 --> 00:54:22,558
We're looking for
a friend of ours,

931
00:54:22,560 --> 00:54:24,960
little wannabe cowboy type,

932
00:54:24,962 --> 00:54:27,529
bout this tall with
his high heel boots on?

933
00:54:27,531 --> 00:54:30,199
You'd know him if you saw him.

934
00:54:32,236 --> 00:54:34,570
Do you guys do illegal things?

935
00:54:34,572 --> 00:54:36,905
(laughing)

936
00:54:36,907 --> 00:54:38,607
Of course not.

937
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,776
You don't
accidentally kill people

938
00:54:40,778 --> 00:54:42,544
and get rid of dead bodies?

939
00:54:42,546 --> 00:54:46,282
[Man] What kind of
people do we look like?

940
00:54:46,284 --> 00:54:48,550
We're just looking
for our friend.

941
00:54:48,552 --> 00:54:50,753
I haven't seen him.

942
00:54:50,755 --> 00:54:52,888
How are you so sure?

943
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:54,323
Well he said I'd
know if he came

944
00:54:54,325 --> 00:54:58,661
and I don't know if he
came, so nothing happened.

945
00:54:58,663 --> 00:55:00,663
I'm gonna get some smokes.

946
00:55:00,665 --> 00:55:02,164
Uh, excuse me, I
said we're closed.

947
00:55:02,166 --> 00:55:03,465
You can't go in.

948
00:55:03,467 --> 00:55:05,434
In fact, I was just
going to lock the door.

949
00:55:05,436 --> 00:55:06,568
You can do that
right after I get my...

950
00:55:06,570 --> 00:55:08,704
I said you can't go in.

951
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:11,240
(sighs) What are you doing?

952
00:55:11,242 --> 00:55:12,775
What are you doing?

953
00:55:12,777 --> 00:55:13,842
(clatters)

954
00:55:13,844 --> 00:55:16,345
(guns cocking)

955
00:55:16,347 --> 00:55:19,014
Have you lost your fucking mind?

956
00:55:19,016 --> 00:55:20,949
It's very possible.

957
00:55:20,951 --> 00:55:23,452
Now can you please just leave?

958
00:55:23,454 --> 00:55:27,323
I am, I am just really,
really busy right now.

959
00:55:29,093 --> 00:55:31,627
Put your pieces down.

960
00:55:31,629 --> 00:55:33,028
What?

961
00:55:33,030 --> 00:55:35,531
You heard me, put em away.

962
00:55:36,701 --> 00:55:38,934
There's cameras everywhere.

963
00:55:38,936 --> 00:55:40,969
No need to make a scene.

964
00:55:40,971 --> 00:55:45,207
She says the store's
closed, I guess it's closed.

965
00:55:45,209 --> 00:55:48,010
We're gonna take a look around.

966
00:55:48,012 --> 00:55:52,614
And if we don't find our
friend, we're coming back.

967
00:55:52,616 --> 00:55:55,751
Maybe the store will
be open by then.

968
00:56:00,324 --> 00:56:03,192
(engines revving)

969
00:56:24,982 --> 00:56:28,884
(dramatic orchestral music)

970
00:56:43,334 --> 00:56:45,667
(rattling)

971
00:56:49,106 --> 00:56:51,473
(pounding)

972
00:56:56,180 --> 00:56:58,280
(clanking)

973
00:57:07,625 --> 00:57:11,293
(dramatic orchestral music)

974
00:57:22,039 --> 00:57:24,173
(flicks)

975
00:57:28,212 --> 00:57:30,546
(flicking)

976
00:57:47,097 --> 00:57:50,632
(dramatic energetic music)

977
00:58:41,318 --> 00:58:44,052
(doorbell rings)

978
00:58:50,127 --> 00:58:50,959
(thumps)

979
00:58:50,961 --> 00:58:54,763
(dramatic energetic music)

980
00:59:06,677 --> 00:59:08,944
(zipping)

981
00:59:13,651 --> 00:59:16,051
(clatters)

982
00:59:17,688 --> 00:59:18,754
(thumps)

983
00:59:18,756 --> 00:59:21,123
(rattling)

984
00:59:24,528 --> 00:59:27,262
(doorbell rings)

985
00:59:28,999 --> 00:59:29,999
Oh, Melinda.

986
00:59:31,168 --> 00:59:32,334
Are you okay?

987
00:59:34,171 --> 00:59:36,371
Is there anyone else
in here with you?

988
00:59:36,373 --> 00:59:38,440
No, it's just me.

989
00:59:38,442 --> 00:59:40,175
[Officer Lou] You're
here by yourself?

990
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:41,177
Yes.

991
00:59:44,915 --> 00:59:45,781
[Officer Lou] Did you notice

992
00:59:45,783 --> 00:59:48,784
anyone suspicious come through?

993
00:59:48,786 --> 00:59:50,352
Uh, I don't know.

994
00:59:52,089 --> 00:59:53,422
Who's suspicious?

995
00:59:54,425 --> 00:59:57,125
You can put your hands down.

996
01:00:00,097 --> 01:00:01,930
There's a gray Toyota
Camry in the parking lot,

997
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:03,699
right next to your van.

998
01:00:03,701 --> 01:00:06,969
That's the stolen
vehicle I'm looking for.

999
01:00:06,971 --> 01:00:09,104
Did you notice it outside?

1000
01:00:09,106 --> 01:00:10,106
No.

1001
01:00:12,076 --> 01:00:15,077
Keys were still
in the ignition.

1002
01:00:15,079 --> 01:00:18,046
When was the last time
you looked outside?

1003
01:00:18,048 --> 01:00:20,015
Maybe 20 minutes ago?

1004
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:22,218
Okay.

1005
01:00:23,387 --> 01:00:24,853
Check the tapes.

1006
01:00:25,756 --> 01:00:28,757
Tom 66, 1124 on the 503, copy.

1007
01:00:28,759 --> 01:00:31,927
[Woman] Uh Lou, you don't
need to use codes every time.

1008
01:00:31,929 --> 01:00:33,662
Just say it.

1009
01:00:33,664 --> 01:00:37,265
Stolen vehicle abandoned
at Paradise Pumps on the 63.

1010
01:00:37,267 --> 01:00:40,869
Suspect missing, I'll
clear the location.

1011
01:00:45,009 --> 01:00:46,608
Melinda, you okay?

1012
01:00:46,610 --> 01:00:48,677
Yeah, I'm fine.

1013
01:00:48,679 --> 01:00:50,445
I don't think we can
look at the tapes though.

1014
01:00:50,447 --> 01:00:52,280
I can't access them.

1015
01:00:52,282 --> 01:00:54,016
Well who has access?

1016
01:00:54,018 --> 01:00:55,150
Diane?

1017
01:00:56,687 --> 01:00:58,987
Yes, but she's not here.

1018
01:01:01,492 --> 01:01:05,193
I hate to have her
drive down at this hour.

1019
01:01:05,195 --> 01:01:06,294
Eh, I gotta do it.

1020
01:01:06,296 --> 01:01:07,696
What's her number?

1021
01:01:07,698 --> 01:01:10,098
[Melinda] Uh, she's
definitely sleeping right now.

1022
01:01:10,100 --> 01:01:12,034
I hear what you're saying.

1023
01:01:12,036 --> 01:01:15,704
I hate to wake her, but I'm
just trying to do my job,

1024
01:01:15,706 --> 01:01:17,506
you know, just follow procedure.

1025
01:01:17,508 --> 01:01:19,274
What's her number?

1026
01:01:19,276 --> 01:01:21,009
I actually,

1027
01:01:21,011 --> 01:01:23,945
I remember now something
suspicious happening.

1028
01:01:23,947 --> 01:01:26,014
Oh, okay, let's
call Diane first

1029
01:01:26,016 --> 01:01:27,215
and once she's on her way,

1030
01:01:27,217 --> 01:01:28,884
then I want to hear what
you have to tell me.

1031
01:01:28,886 --> 01:01:31,119
That way we're firing
on all cylinders

1032
01:01:31,121 --> 01:01:33,622
and not wasting any time, okay?

1033
01:01:34,792 --> 01:01:35,792
Okay.

1034
01:01:37,294 --> 01:01:41,196
(menacing orchestral music)

1035
01:01:43,867 --> 01:01:45,067
They should really
give you the keys.

1036
01:01:45,069 --> 01:01:48,136
You're the most
dependable one here.

1037
01:01:54,078 --> 01:01:55,177
And I think you're right.

1038
01:01:55,179 --> 01:01:56,645
She's probably asleep.

1039
01:01:56,647 --> 01:01:58,346
Yeah, she was really tired,

1040
01:01:58,348 --> 01:01:59,514
plus I don't think you'll...

1041
01:01:59,516 --> 01:02:00,315
Hold on, let me try again.

1042
01:02:00,317 --> 01:02:01,917
[Melinda] What?

1043
01:02:01,919 --> 01:02:05,087
Sometimes when you, it
takes a couple of tries.

1044
01:02:05,089 --> 01:02:06,354
You know, when you call twice,

1045
01:02:06,356 --> 01:02:08,990
people generally take
that as an emergency.

1046
01:02:08,992 --> 01:02:10,225
Diane?

1047
01:02:10,227 --> 01:02:13,195
Hi, I'm sorry to wake
you, this is Officer Lou

1048
01:02:13,197 --> 01:02:16,264
of the Filson County
sheriff's department.

1049
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:18,066
Yes, hi.

1050
01:02:18,068 --> 01:02:20,335
Uh, we have a situation
here at the Paradise Pumps

1051
01:02:20,337 --> 01:02:25,173
and we're gonna need to see
the surveillance tapes ASAP.

1052
01:02:25,175 --> 01:02:26,575
Yeah, Melinda's right here.

1053
01:02:26,577 --> 01:02:30,378
She says you're the only
one that has access to them.

1054
01:02:30,380 --> 01:02:31,380
Uh huh.

1055
01:02:33,450 --> 01:02:35,584
I'm sorry, Diane, I
know this is unfair,

1056
01:02:35,586 --> 01:02:37,786
but we have a situation...

1057
01:02:41,225 --> 01:02:44,626
I'm not authorized
to give you a raise.

1058
01:02:45,963 --> 01:02:48,263
I personally can't compensate
you to drive down here...

1059
01:02:48,265 --> 01:02:49,798
As a police officer,
I'm ordering you

1060
01:02:49,800 --> 01:02:52,300
to come down with the keys
and show me the tapes.

1061
01:02:52,302 --> 01:02:53,602
Is that clear?

1062
01:02:54,638 --> 01:02:55,638
Thank you.

1063
01:02:57,975 --> 01:03:00,342
She's a very negative person.

1064
01:03:02,479 --> 01:03:04,112
Okay.

1065
01:03:04,114 --> 01:03:06,248
So what were you saying?

1066
01:03:06,250 --> 01:03:09,751
I was saying that I remember
something suspicious now.

1067
01:03:09,753 --> 01:03:11,653
About half an hour
ago, someone came in

1068
01:03:11,655 --> 01:03:14,289
asking about the nearest
hotel and I told them

1069
01:03:14,291 --> 01:03:16,825
about the Motel 6 by the 18.

1070
01:03:16,827 --> 01:03:20,095
He was the last person I
saw since that car showed up

1071
01:03:20,097 --> 01:03:22,931
and I think he left
in a green Jeep.

1072
01:03:22,933 --> 01:03:28,003
And you're saying this
person was suspicious, how?

1073
01:03:28,005 --> 01:03:30,205
He was just suspicious.

1074
01:03:31,141 --> 01:03:34,009
You can take my word for it.

1075
01:03:34,011 --> 01:03:35,076
Okay, um...

1076
01:03:37,147 --> 01:03:40,081
Sorry I couldn't
remember that earlier

1077
01:03:40,083 --> 01:03:43,018
when you were pointing
the gun at me.

1078
01:03:44,021 --> 01:03:46,588
I apologize about that.

1079
01:03:46,590 --> 01:03:48,423
I didn't mean to scare you.

1080
01:03:48,425 --> 01:03:50,125
I'm fine.

1081
01:03:50,127 --> 01:03:51,860
You might actually be
able to catch him still

1082
01:03:51,862 --> 01:03:53,929
if you leave right now.

1083
01:03:53,931 --> 01:03:55,764
[Officer Lou] Did you
get a license plate?

1084
01:03:55,766 --> 01:03:56,766
Uh no.

1085
01:04:01,305 --> 01:04:04,873
Well, that's one
hell of a first night.

1086
01:04:05,976 --> 01:04:08,710
Tom 66, possible
suspect in a green Jeep,

1087
01:04:08,712 --> 01:04:13,081
be on the look out for all
green Jeeps near the 18.

1088
01:04:14,318 --> 01:04:16,017
All right, I'm gonna go
check out the Motel 6

1089
01:04:16,019 --> 01:04:18,119
and by the time I get
back, Diane should be here

1090
01:04:18,121 --> 01:04:20,355
and we'll check the tapes.

1091
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:21,957
I'm just gonna do a
quick sweep of the store

1092
01:04:21,959 --> 01:04:23,124
just to make sure
we're all clear.

1093
01:04:23,126 --> 01:04:24,292
Quick sweep.

1094
01:04:24,294 --> 01:04:25,961
Yeah, it's just procedure.

1095
01:04:25,963 --> 01:04:28,096
But I said he's not here.

1096
01:04:30,567 --> 01:04:32,968
Melinda, is
everything all right?

1097
01:04:32,970 --> 01:04:34,402
Yes.

1098
01:04:34,404 --> 01:04:39,040
You keep asking me that and
I keep telling you, yes.

1099
01:04:39,042 --> 01:04:41,142
Do you not believe me?

1100
01:04:43,046 --> 01:04:46,882
Hey, if there's
something you know

1101
01:04:46,884 --> 01:04:49,818
or is there something wrong,

1102
01:04:49,820 --> 01:04:51,653
you know you can tell me, right?

1103
01:04:51,655 --> 01:04:53,154
I just want to make
sure you're safe

1104
01:04:53,156 --> 01:04:55,824
and I don't want anything
happening to you.

1105
01:04:55,826 --> 01:04:57,058
I care about you.

1106
01:04:57,060 --> 01:04:59,828
You don't need to say that.

1107
01:04:59,830 --> 01:05:01,930
(stuttering) Say what?

1108
01:05:01,932 --> 01:05:05,433
I know you're
just doing your job.

1109
01:05:05,435 --> 01:05:08,203
You're always just
doing your job.

1110
01:05:08,205 --> 01:05:11,106
You don't need to say all
that extra stuff to me.

1111
01:05:11,108 --> 01:05:12,173
You've never said
it to me before,

1112
01:05:12,175 --> 01:05:15,076
you don't need to say it now.

1113
01:05:15,078 --> 01:05:16,845
It's too late.

1114
01:05:16,847 --> 01:05:19,714
I'm sorry, but I mean it
when I say I care about you.

1115
01:05:19,716 --> 01:05:24,586
(crying) You don't even
really know who I am, so.

1116
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:25,854
It's not real.

1117
01:05:33,063 --> 01:05:35,563
I'm gonna go
sweep the premises.

1118
01:05:35,565 --> 01:05:39,501
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1119
01:06:02,492 --> 01:06:05,193
(door creaks)

1120
01:06:06,930 --> 01:06:11,166
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1121
01:06:29,319 --> 01:06:32,087
All right, everything
looks good.

1122
01:06:33,857 --> 01:06:36,291
I'll go check on the Motel 6.

1123
01:06:36,293 --> 01:06:38,927
Who has the morning shift?

1124
01:06:38,929 --> 01:06:40,428
Uh, I'm not sure.

1125
01:06:44,001 --> 01:06:45,600
Okay.

1126
01:06:45,602 --> 01:06:47,268
I'll go check on the Jeep.

1127
01:06:47,270 --> 01:06:48,603
I'll be back.

1128
01:06:48,605 --> 01:06:50,271
Okay.

1129
01:06:50,273 --> 01:06:53,008
You didn't find
anything strange?

1130
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:56,878
Nope, just like you said.

1131
01:06:58,315 --> 01:07:00,982
I believed you the whole time.

1132
01:07:00,984 --> 01:07:05,020
If you see anything
or need anything,

1133
01:07:05,022 --> 01:07:08,089
my cell phone
number's on this card.

1134
01:07:10,027 --> 01:07:12,227
You can call me directly.

1135
01:07:20,237 --> 01:07:22,971
(doorbell rings)

1136
01:07:45,896 --> 01:07:48,963
(walking footsteps)

1137
01:08:18,095 --> 01:08:20,462
(clanking)

1138
01:08:32,042 --> 01:08:33,708
(door closes)

1139
01:08:33,710 --> 01:08:36,644
(distant rattling)

1140
01:08:37,547 --> 01:08:38,547
Hello?

1141
01:09:10,347 --> 01:09:13,214
(humming traffic)

1142
01:09:16,319 --> 01:09:20,021
(gentle orchestral music)

1143
01:10:34,864 --> 01:10:37,265
(rumbling)

1144
01:10:42,772 --> 01:10:44,572
(banging)

1145
01:10:44,574 --> 01:10:46,641
(gasps)

1146
01:11:04,394 --> 01:11:07,395
(loud bang)

1147
01:11:07,397 --> 01:11:11,032
(menacing orchestral music)

1148
01:11:12,869 --> 01:11:15,203
(rattling)

1149
01:11:18,975 --> 01:11:21,376
(clinking)

1150
01:11:23,480 --> 01:11:25,847
(rattling)

1151
01:11:30,954 --> 01:11:35,156
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1152
01:11:45,635 --> 01:11:47,135
[Man] Melinda?

1153
01:11:50,407 --> 01:11:52,540
This is your last chance!

1154
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:56,010
Do not fuck with me!

1155
01:11:56,012 --> 01:11:59,681
(dramatic orchestral music)

1156
01:12:17,634 --> 01:12:18,700
Melinda!

1157
01:12:18,702 --> 01:12:19,867
Okay, stop.

1158
01:12:21,771 --> 01:12:24,138
Can you just stop now, please?

1159
01:12:24,140 --> 01:12:26,641
I'll burn this whole
place down right now.

1160
01:12:26,643 --> 01:12:28,943
The floor is covered
with gasoline.

1161
01:12:28,945 --> 01:12:32,580
(dramatic orchestral music)

1162
01:12:35,719 --> 01:12:37,618
Give me the fucking backpack.

1163
01:12:37,620 --> 01:12:40,955
You can have it
if you let me go and

1164
01:12:40,957 --> 01:12:42,357
and if you don't tell
anybody what happened,

1165
01:12:42,359 --> 01:12:44,025
I'll give it to you.

1166
01:12:46,296 --> 01:12:48,563
What's going on?

1167
01:12:48,565 --> 01:12:49,731
What are you doing?

1168
01:12:49,733 --> 01:12:51,833
Uh, it won't open.

1169
01:12:51,835 --> 01:12:54,902
The security locks the
doors when the power's out.

1170
01:12:54,904 --> 01:12:56,971
(rattling)

1171
01:12:56,973 --> 01:12:58,873
Why is the power out?

1172
01:12:58,875 --> 01:13:00,708
Did Sheila come back?

1173
01:13:00,710 --> 01:13:03,411
Melinda, is Sheila
here? (knocks)

1174
01:13:03,413 --> 01:13:04,679
Hey. (rattling)

1175
01:13:04,681 --> 01:13:06,180
Melinda!

1176
01:13:06,182 --> 01:13:08,082
Where are you going?

1177
01:13:08,084 --> 01:13:10,017
(knocking)

1178
01:13:10,019 --> 01:13:12,019
(rattling)

1179
01:13:12,021 --> 01:13:15,957
(suspenseful orchestral music)

1180
01:13:34,544 --> 01:13:35,343
Hey, who are you?

1181
01:13:35,345 --> 01:13:36,344
Listen you...

1182
01:13:36,346 --> 01:13:37,278
Whoa, whoa, what
happened to you?

1183
01:13:37,280 --> 01:13:38,112
You've got to trust me...

1184
01:13:38,114 --> 01:13:39,614
- Back up.
- Okay, okay.

1185
01:13:39,616 --> 01:13:40,782
She's fucking crazy, man.

1186
01:13:40,784 --> 01:13:42,049
She burned my fucking face.

1187
01:13:42,051 --> 01:13:44,085
She tied me to a chair,
she tried to rape me.

1188
01:13:44,087 --> 01:13:45,353
She shot her fucking coworker

1189
01:13:45,355 --> 01:13:46,387
and now she's gonna burn
the whole place down!

1190
01:13:46,389 --> 01:13:47,422
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what'd you say?

1191
01:13:47,424 --> 01:13:48,756
I said she's gonna
burn the whole...

1192
01:13:48,758 --> 01:13:49,791
No, no, no, no, about
her coworker, what'd ou...

1193
01:13:49,793 --> 01:13:50,725
She shot her fuckincoworker.

1194
01:13:50,727 --> 01:13:51,559
She's out of her fucking mind.

1195
01:13:51,561 --> 01:13:52,794
Her coworker...

1196
01:13:52,796 --> 01:13:53,694
I don't fucking believe
you, what do you...

1197
01:13:53,696 --> 01:13:54,695
Stop!

1198
01:13:54,697 --> 01:13:55,530
What are you talking about?

1199
01:13:55,532 --> 01:13:56,297
Are you fu...

1200
01:13:56,299 --> 01:13:57,265
I'm staying back...

1201
01:13:57,267 --> 01:13:58,299
What are you talking about?

1202
01:13:58,301 --> 01:13:59,534
I promise, I promise, okay?

1203
01:13:59,536 --> 01:14:00,601
What's he talking about?

1204
01:14:00,603 --> 01:14:01,702
I'm just a customer, okay?

1205
01:14:01,704 --> 01:14:03,237
Where's Sheila?

1206
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:04,472
Where the fuck is she?

1207
01:14:04,474 --> 01:14:05,773
Did you do something to her?

1208
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:06,607
No.

1209
01:14:06,609 --> 01:14:07,375
Did you fucking shoot her?

1210
01:14:07,377 --> 01:14:08,242
No, no, it wasn't me.

1211
01:14:08,244 --> 01:14:09,577
Why did you hurt her?

1212
01:14:09,579 --> 01:14:10,445
- I was just trying to help.
- Tell me the truth!

1213
01:14:10,447 --> 01:14:12,280
He's the one that shot Sheila.

1214
01:14:12,282 --> 01:14:16,083
(grunting)
(dramatic orchestral music)

1215
01:14:16,085 --> 01:14:19,220
Hey stop it, just, you
can have it, just leave.

1216
01:14:19,222 --> 01:14:22,790
You can take it and leave
just like you wanted to.

1217
01:14:22,792 --> 01:14:24,425
Stop!

1218
01:14:24,427 --> 01:14:26,794
(grunting)

1219
01:14:27,764 --> 01:14:29,096
Stop!

1220
01:14:29,098 --> 01:14:33,968
(grunting)
(menacing orchestral music)

1221
01:14:33,970 --> 01:14:35,937
Stop it.

1222
01:14:35,939 --> 01:14:38,306
(grunting)

1223
01:14:45,648 --> 01:14:47,915
(hissing)

1224
01:14:51,488 --> 01:14:53,754
(choking)

1225
01:15:04,367 --> 01:15:07,435
(labored breathing)

1226
01:15:26,189 --> 01:15:29,090
(engine starts)

1227
01:15:50,146 --> 01:15:51,212
Officer Lou?

1228
01:15:52,215 --> 01:15:53,781
Hi, it's Melinda.

1229
01:15:55,218 --> 01:15:58,586
(crying) No, it's not okay.

1230
01:15:58,588 --> 01:16:01,989
Lou, can you please
just come back, I...

1231
01:16:03,092 --> 01:16:04,625
No, just listen, I,

1232
01:16:05,762 --> 01:16:06,762
I lied.

1233
01:16:07,664 --> 01:16:10,364
I lied about the guy, I...

1234
01:16:10,366 --> 01:16:12,867
Yes, I think so, but
the door's locked

1235
01:16:12,869 --> 01:16:14,001
and the power's out
and I can't get out.

1236
01:16:14,003 --> 01:16:19,106
(screeching)
(glass shattering)

1237
01:16:19,108 --> 01:16:23,010
(menacing orchestral music)

1238
01:16:29,953 --> 01:16:33,054
(crunching)

1239
01:16:33,056 --> 01:16:34,388
The money's right
there on the counter.

1240
01:16:34,390 --> 01:16:37,792
Please, you can just
take it and leave.

1241
01:16:41,197 --> 01:16:42,197
I'm sorry.

1242
01:16:43,232 --> 01:16:46,100
I really didn't mean for
all of this to happen.

1243
01:16:46,102 --> 01:16:47,802
Please, I'll burn
the whole place down

1244
01:16:47,804 --> 01:16:49,403
and we can just forget it.

1245
01:16:49,405 --> 01:16:53,040
(menacing orchestral music)

1246
01:16:55,979 --> 01:16:57,645
You were gonna take the
fuckin' money and run,

1247
01:16:57,647 --> 01:16:59,547
weren't you?

1248
01:16:59,549 --> 01:17:03,784
Yes, but I thought you
were dead and I just figured,

1249
01:17:03,786 --> 01:17:04,585
but you can have it.

1250
01:17:04,587 --> 01:17:07,254
It's all there, I promise.

1251
01:17:07,256 --> 01:17:08,756
Oh and your gun,
don't forget that.

1252
01:17:08,758 --> 01:17:10,625
You can have that too.

1253
01:17:11,828 --> 01:17:14,662
Look the police are
gonna be here any minute.

1254
01:17:14,664 --> 01:17:16,998
You, you called the police?

1255
01:17:18,401 --> 01:17:20,434
Yes, but you still have time.

1256
01:17:20,436 --> 01:17:21,902
You can just leave.

1257
01:17:21,904 --> 01:17:25,840
(crying) You can just leave.

1258
01:17:25,842 --> 01:17:28,843
This didn't have to
be complicated, Melinda.

1259
01:17:28,845 --> 01:17:30,945
(crying) I know.

1260
01:17:30,947 --> 01:17:33,948
You made me into a killer.

1261
01:17:33,950 --> 01:17:36,784
I don't think I
made you kill anybody.

1262
01:17:36,786 --> 01:17:38,819
I mean, you definitely
didn't need to kill Perry.

1263
01:17:38,821 --> 01:17:42,857
He was just really
in love with Sheila.

1264
01:17:42,859 --> 01:17:44,792
You're right, I'm
sorry, I screwed up.

1265
01:17:44,794 --> 01:17:48,229
Stop with all your
fucking, I'm sorry's.

1266
01:17:49,766 --> 01:17:52,833
You drugged me and
tried to rape me.

1267
01:17:55,872 --> 01:17:59,473
Do you think that you were
just gonna get away with that?

1268
01:17:59,475 --> 01:18:02,009
(crying) I just,

1269
01:18:02,011 --> 01:18:03,678
I just wanted to
be with someone.

1270
01:18:03,680 --> 01:18:08,949
I just (crying) I just
forgot what I wanted.

1271
01:18:08,951 --> 01:18:13,821
What, what are you gonna tell
the cops when they get here?

1272
01:18:13,823 --> 01:18:15,156
Are you going to
tell them about me?

1273
01:18:15,158 --> 01:18:18,359
Are you going to
tell them about you?

1274
01:18:18,361 --> 01:18:20,161
I'll tell them the truth.

1275
01:18:20,163 --> 01:18:23,230
(crying) All of it.

1276
01:18:25,968 --> 01:18:27,034
The truth.

1277
01:18:27,970 --> 01:18:29,070
Hm, no.

1278
01:18:33,076 --> 01:18:36,243
No, that's, that's
not gonna be enough,

1279
01:18:40,216 --> 01:18:42,983
not after what you did.

1280
01:18:42,985 --> 01:18:45,686

1281

(sirens sounding)

1293
01:20:05,134 --> 01:20:07,301
Melinda, Melinda,
come on, come on.

1294
01:20:07,303 --> 01:20:08,869
Come on, got you.

1295
01:20:10,740 --> 01:20:11,672

1296
01:20:11,674 --> 01:20:12,674
I got you.

1297
01:20:13,509 --> 01:20:14,909
I got you.

1298
01:20:14,911 --> 01:20:17,011
Okay, here we go, let's go.

Okay, don't be scared,
we'll get you to safety.

Come on.

1302

Watch your head,

1303
01:20:26,656 --> 01:20:29,657
Hold tight here, everything's
going to be okay.

1304
01:20:29,659 --> 01:20:31,959
Help is on the way.

1305
01:20:31,961 --> 01:20:34,962
Tom 66, we have a large
fire at Paradise Pumps.

1306
01:20:34,964 --> 01:20:37,531
I have a conscious adult female,

1307

severe burns on the legs,
I need EMS immediately.

1308
01:20:40,970 --> 01:20:44,271
Oh my gosh, I'm so
sorry, I'm so sorry.

1309
01:20:44,273 --> 01:20:46,774
I shouldn't have left you.

1310
01:20:46,776 --> 01:20:49,043
I was just trying
to follow procedure.

1311
01:20:49,045 --> 01:20:50,045
I'm so sorry.

1312
01:20:52,281 --> 01:20:53,614
What can I do?

1313

Tell me, what can I do,
