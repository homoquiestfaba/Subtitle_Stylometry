And that right there...

00:00:12,729 --> 00:00:14,606
Well, that's me
and my brother Luke.

5
00:00:18,635 --> 00:00:20,615
The big guy's our Uncle Connor.

00:00:20,637 --> 00:00:22,082
He's our Dad's twin.

7
00:00:23,006 --> 00:00:26,647
As you can see,
twins run in our family.

8
00:00:31,581 --> 00:00:33,857
That, unfortunately
is our parents.

9
00:00:33,883 --> 00:00:36,056
They were killed
by a drunk driver

10
00:00:36,086 --> 00:00:37,929
when we were five.

11
00:00:37,954 --> 00:00:41,197
Ironic, when you consider
they made beer for a living.

12
00:00:41,958 --> 00:00:44,199

Our parents founded
Left Hand Brewing Company

57
00:03:44,240 --> 00:03:45,844
with our Uncle Connor.

58
00:03:45,875 --> 00:03:47,252
And after Luke and I were born,

59
00:03:47,277 --> 00:03:50,281
the three of them started
working on a family beer.

60
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:53,453
But our parents had died while
it was still in development,

61
00:03:53,483 --> 00:03:55,520
and our Uncle just
didn't have the heart

62
00:03:55,752 --> 00:03:57,288
to finish it without them,
you know.

63
00:03:58,521 --> 00:04:01,365
He talked about it
all the time, though.

64
00:04:01,391 --> 00:04:02,836
Said, that one day

65
00:04:02,859 --> 00:04:05,100
he, Luke, and I were gonna
finish ft together.

66
00:04:05,128 --> 00:04:08,234
But first, we'd have to learn the
fundamentals of brewing at home,

67
00:04:08,264 --> 00:04:11,108
before we could ever hope
to work at the brewery.

68
00:04:11,134 --> 00:04:13,546
He said that the virtues
we would learn

69
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:15,977
over the years it took
to become great brewers,

70
00:04:16,005 --> 00:04:18,383
would one day
make Luke and I men.

71
00:04:18,408 --> 00:04:21,355
He told us that one day
we were gonna have to finish

72
00:04:21,377 --> 00:04:23,323
the family ale,
and when we did,

73
00:04:23,346 --> 00:04:25,417
it better not taste like piss.

74
00:04:30,787 --> 00:04:32,528
Jesus, did you piss in this?

75
00:04:35,291 --> 00:04:38,170
In high school, we developed
a certain reputation

76
00:04:38,194 --> 00:04:40,140
with the ladies.

77
00:04:46,803 --> 00:04:49,079
In college,
we partied pretty hard.

78
00:04:51,074 --> 00:04:53,111
And looking back on it, shit,

79
00:04:53,142 --> 00:04:55,486
hard to believe we went
to school for anything else.

00:04:56,512 --> 00:04:58,287
[all yelling]

81
00:05:02,285 --> 00:05:03,593
well, why don't you let me

82
00:05:03,820 --> 00:05:05,299
take you to dinner
some time and show you.

83
00:05:05,321 --> 00:05:08,598
You're kind of cute,
but I have a boyfriend.

84
00:05:08,825 --> 00:05:09,599
Really?!

85
00:05:19,836 --> 00:05:21,611
So are we still gonna
get that dinner later?

86
00:05:22,472 --> 00:05:24,349
It's OK, Luke, I get it.

87
00:05:24,374 --> 00:05:25,444
What?

88
00:05:25,475 --> 00:05:27,079
I know what this is.

89
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:31,520
That girl slnglehandedly ruined
my last semester of college.

90
00:05:31,547 --> 00:05:34,050
Ever since then
Luke felt all guilty

91
00:05:34,083 --> 00:05:37,496
and went on this huge mission
to find a girlfriend.

92
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,194
However, with five months
until graduation,

93
00:05:40,223 --> 00:05:43,636
I too had asked myself what the
hell l was doing with my life.

94
00:05:43,860 --> 00:05:45,965
And so, Luke and I
decided it was time

95
00:05:45,995 --> 00:05:49,499
We would ask Connor permission
to finish the family ale.

96
00:05:49,999 --> 00:05:51,410

See what you can do.

103
00:06:14,891 --> 00:06:16,063
Connor gave us his blessing;

104
00:06:16,092 --> 00:06:18,129
We set off
to finish the family ale.

105
00:06:18,161 --> 00:06:21,267
It was our one chance to prove
to him and the other brewers

106
00:06:21,297 --> 00:06:24,073
that we could
one day run this brewery.

107
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,340
But it wasn't just that...

108
00:06:25,368 --> 00:06:27,644
I mean, this beer
was everything to us.

109
00:06:27,670 --> 00:06:32,016
It represented who we were
and where we came from...

110
00:06:32,041 --> 00:06:34,521
Nothing would stop
us from finishing it.

You Know, beer's actually
the only reason

116

we have civilization
to begin with.

117
00:07:10,446 --> 00:07:12,289
It gave birth to agriculture.

118
00:07:12,315 --> 00:07:14,454
Before beer, no one wanted
to live around each other.

119
00:07:14,484 --> 00:07:15,622
Then we invent it and like,

120
00:07:15,651 --> 00:07:17,460
"As long as we have
this stuff, I think

121
00:07:17,487 --> 00:07:20,195
we can tolerate each other,
and we could form communities."

122
00:07:20,223 --> 00:07:21,293
You're stupid.

123
00:07:21,324 --> 00:07:23,497
That's Derek.
Luke and I just met him

You're gonna love it.

129
00:07:32,135 --> 00:07:34,081
We've been to couple parties,
and they're insane.

130
00:07:34,103 --> 00:07:35,480
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

131
00:07:35,505 --> 00:07:37,451
I really don't
know much about that.

132
00:07:37,473 --> 00:07:40,010
I was never a really big partier
in high school, you know?

I love you, man!

137
00:07:53,222 --> 00:07:54,633
Way to go, Derek!

138
00:07:55,057 --> 00:07:56,502
I don't feel so good.

139
00:08:01,397 --> 00:08:03,172
What's wrong?

140
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,008
Nothin', man.

And will you please grab
a beer, for God's sakes!

147
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:25,156
It pains me when you drink
these drinks in front of me!

developing your palate.

being so...

00:08:39,368 --> 00:08:40,438

And...let's go...

No, no, no.
Slow down, slow down.

156
00:08:48,044 --> 00:08:49,216
I don't think
we're ready for this.

157
00:08:49,245 --> 00:08:50,747
- What?
- Just slow down.

158
00:08:51,547 --> 00:08:54,323
- Are you gay?
- No! I'm trying to be mature.

159
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:56,796
OK, what's mature
about celibacy, Luke?

160
00:08:56,819 --> 00:08:58,423
Between you and Corey,

161
00:08:58,454 --> 00:08:59,762
you've slept with
half the campus.

162
00:08:59,789 --> 00:09:01,359
And I'm trying
to move on from that.

163
00:09:01,390 --> 00:09:03,700
You Know, have a relationship.

164

start a family with.

00:09:08,397 --> 00:09:10,138
That's creepy.

How the hell is that creepy?

when she was 23.

171

Just kiss me.

172
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:18,216
No, I really want
to talk about this.

173
00:09:18,241 --> 00:09:19,584
Luke, just kiss me!

174
00:09:19,609 --> 00:09:20,587
I'm trying to...

175
00:09:20,610 --> 00:09:23,523
Whoa! You Know what, Luke,
this is, um...

- I'm sorry.

00:53:42,269 --> 00:53:44,806
Other than that,
I really love you.

1073
00:53:44,838 --> 00:53:46,249
I really love you too, man.

1074
00:53:46,273 --> 00:53:48,776
If you did you wouldn't have
done what you did to me today!

1075
00:53:48,808 --> 00:53:51,186
It's only because I know Kelly
isn't the right girl for you.

1076
00:53:51,211 --> 00:53:53,418
- How would you Know?
- Because I Know you!

1077
00:53:53,446 --> 00:53:56,052
You've never been in a serious
relationship in your life.

1078
00:53:56,082 --> 00:53:59,120
You don't know what it's like
to lose a girl you love.

1079
00:53:59,152 --> 00:54:00,529
Wait, dude,
that's not true, man.

1080
00:54:00,754 --> 00:54:01,528
That's not fair.

1081
00:54:01,755 --> 00:54:03,996
What? Who?

1082
00:54:04,024 --> 00:54:05,264
Samantha Cooper.

1083
00:54:06,826 --> 00:54:09,136
Dude, that was in,
like, grade 4.

1084
00:54:09,162 --> 00:54:11,108
It doesn't make it
any less real, man.

1085
00:54:11,131 --> 00:54:12,337
I think I really loved her,

1086
00:54:12,365 --> 00:54:14,868
and then she just up and moved
to Florida with her family.

1087
00:54:14,901 --> 00:54:16,471
Couldn't do anything about it.

1088
00:54:17,771 --> 00:54:20,274
It's OK, man.
I know what it's like to lose.

1089
00:54:24,177 --> 00:54:27,249
I lost the girl...I love.

1090
00:54:28,281 --> 00:54:30,557
I was gonna marry her.

1091
00:54:30,784 --> 00:54:34,095
Dude, Luke, seriously...
You're trippin' balls right now.

1092
00:54:34,120 --> 00:54:35,394
You do not want to marry...

1093
00:54:35,422 --> 00:54:37,902
Yes, I do!
I want a family!

1094
00:54:37,924 --> 00:54:40,063
You do not want a family.
You're too young for that!

1095
00:54:40,093 --> 00:54:42,004
I'm too young?
Might be!

1096
00:54:42,028 --> 00:54:43,166
But we were too young!

1097
00:54:43,196 --> 00:54:45,039
It wasn't fair that we
never got to have a family

1098
00:54:45,065 --> 00:54:46,544
like other people!

1099
00:55:02,482 --> 00:55:05,429
It's you and me, man.
We have a family.

1100
00:55:05,452 --> 00:55:07,454
It's always been you and me.

1101
00:55:16,262 --> 00:55:18,242
I'm just tired of this...

1102
00:55:21,835 --> 00:55:23,075
I'm gonna hug the wall.

1103
00:55:23,103 --> 00:55:24,275
You hug the wall,

1104
00:55:24,304 --> 00:55:27,183
and we'll be hugging
the wall together...

1105
00:55:27,207 --> 00:55:28,914
- OK?
- All right.

1106
00:55:28,942 --> 00:55:30,615
- Are you doin' it?
- I'm doin' it, man.

1107
00:55:30,844 --> 00:55:32,414
I think I can feel it.

1108
00:55:32,445 --> 00:55:34,982
I can feel it too.
I can feel the connection.

1109
00:55:42,489 --> 00:55:44,526
God...

1110
00:55:44,557 --> 00:55:47,094
Somebody really needs
to kick your ass.

1111
00:55:47,861 --> 00:55:48,999
This bullshit.

1112
00:55:52,298 --> 00:55:53,299
[laughs]

1113
00:55:56,069 --> 00:55:57,173
Sit down!

1114
00:55:58,505 --> 00:56:00,246
Are you alive?

1115
00:56:00,273 --> 00:56:02,651
Just, you Know,
you're just sittin' there.

1116
00:56:02,876 --> 00:56:04,184
I was drugged today!

1117
00:56:04,210 --> 00:56:06,212
But aren't you
pissed off what he did to ya?

1118
00:56:06,246 --> 00:56:07,384
We already made up.

1119
00:56:07,414 --> 00:56:08,654
We're cool.

1120
00:56:08,882 --> 00:56:10,555
- That's bullshit.
- I'm high.

1121
00:56:10,583 --> 00:56:12,221
Ah, just...

1122
00:56:12,252 --> 00:56:14,425
Just shut up with
the whole high thing.

1123
00:56:14,454 --> 00:56:15,432
You know what...

1124
00:56:15,455 --> 00:56:16,957
How am I gonna get
Kelly to take me back?

1125
00:56:16,990 --> 00:56:18,128
Did you ever think about that?

1126
00:56:18,158 --> 00:56:20,138
You Know, the brother
bonding thing doesn't work

1127
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:22,367
when you do shitty things
to each other.

1128
00:56:22,395 --> 00:56:25,672
I don't give a shit,
how crazy you guys are...

1129
00:56:25,899 --> 00:56:28,209
The crazy shit you do.
I don't care.

1130
00:56:28,234 --> 00:56:29,975
As long as you're
good to each other,

1131
00:56:30,003 --> 00:56:30,947
and you're good
to other people,

1132
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:32,950
I don't give a shit.
It's OK with me.

1133
00:56:32,972 --> 00:56:34,315
But you hurt
your brother tonight.

1134
00:56:34,340 --> 00:56:35,580
And how do you
think your parents

1135
00:56:35,608 --> 00:56:36,985
would have felt about that?

1136
00:56:37,010 --> 00:56:38,614
How do you think
your dad would have felt

1137
00:56:38,645 --> 00:56:40,454
about you drugging your brother?

1138
00:56:40,480 --> 00:56:43,051
How do you think your mom
would feel,

1139
00:56:43,083 --> 00:56:45,495
even about you
letting him get away with this?

1140
00:56:49,255 --> 00:56:51,257
I shouldn't have done it to you.

1141
00:56:56,663 --> 00:56:59,234
Would you just...
come alive, man?

1142
00:56:59,265 --> 00:57:01,245
- What do you want me to do?!
- Hit him!

1143
00:57:01,267 --> 00:57:03,042
Hit him in the face!

1144
00:57:03,069 --> 00:57:04,377
I already did that.

1145
00:57:13,246 --> 00:57:14,486
[speaking Russian]

1146
00:57:15,482 --> 00:57:16,984
[door squeaks open]

1147
00:57:17,016 --> 00:57:19,189
Misha, Misha...

1148
00:57:31,197 --> 00:57:32,676
Ahh!

1149
00:57:33,299 --> 00:57:34,369
[speaks Russian]

1150
00:57:38,438 --> 00:57:39,746
Hey, man, thanks.

1151
00:57:39,973 --> 00:57:40,644
Yes, sir.

1152
00:57:41,641 --> 00:57:43,314
You can't be in such a hurry

1153
00:57:43,343 --> 00:57:44,981
to make things happen
with Kelly.

1154
00:57:45,011 --> 00:57:46,991
It takes time.

1155
00:57:48,381 --> 00:57:51,453
To become...
the kind of a man...

1156
00:57:51,484 --> 00:57:54,328
That, uh, can truly become
a great...

1157
00:57:54,354 --> 00:57:56,425
Father, and husband,
you know...

1158
00:57:56,456 --> 00:57:58,231
But I'm doin'
all these things, right?

1159
00:57:58,258 --> 00:57:59,999
I want to be that guy for her.

1160
00:58:00,226 --> 00:58:01,637
You and Kelly...

1161
00:58:01,661 --> 00:58:03,641
Both need to focus...

1162
00:58:03,663 --> 00:58:05,472
On yourselves right now.

1163
00:58:05,498 --> 00:58:07,409
Because neither one of you

1164
00:58:07,433 --> 00:58:09,538
is ready to make
that kind of commitment.

1165
00:58:09,569 --> 00:58:11,640
Believe you me.
All right?

1166
00:58:11,671 --> 00:58:14,049
Because in relationships,
my friend,

1167
00:58:14,073 --> 00:58:17,714
things just...happen.

1168
00:58:17,744 --> 00:58:20,691
And, you Know, are you
gonna be the Kind of a guy

1169
00:58:20,713 --> 00:58:24,024
who's gonna stick around
for the good stuff...

1170
00:58:24,050 --> 00:58:27,497
The bad stuff,
the ugly stuff...

1171
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:29,295
It can get messy sometimes.

1172
00:58:29,322 --> 00:58:31,302
But men don't leave.

1173
00:58:35,228 --> 00:58:36,639
Hey, Kelly...

1174
00:58:38,531 --> 00:58:40,033
Can I come in?

1175
00:58:40,667 --> 00:58:42,146
Be my guest.

1176
00:58:43,469 --> 00:58:45,142
What do you want?

1177
00:58:45,705 --> 00:58:48,413
I like your setup here...
it's nice.

1178
00:58:49,175 --> 00:58:52,054
You came to talk to me
about my setup?

1179
00:58:52,579 --> 00:58:53,557
Come on.

1180
00:58:53,580 --> 00:58:55,651
I don't think you're
being very fair to Luke.

1181
00:58:55,682 --> 00:58:58,390
Oh? I'm not being fair to Luke?

1182
00:58:58,418 --> 00:59:00,125
Didn't you just drug him?

1183
00:59:00,153 --> 00:59:01,496
Yes.

1184
00:59:01,521 --> 00:59:03,432
That is why I have
come here to tell you

1185
00:59:03,456 --> 00:59:05,697
that you should
give him another chance.

1186
00:59:05,725 --> 00:59:06,829
Corey...

1187
00:59:07,060 --> 00:59:09,131
You're not gonna find
another guy as good as Luke.

1188
00:59:09,162 --> 00:59:10,732
He's not ready.

1189
00:59:10,763 --> 00:59:12,640
If you give him the chance...

1190
00:59:12,665 --> 00:59:14,372
I'm not ready.

1191
00:59:16,269 --> 00:59:17,646
Please talk to him then.

1192
00:59:17,670 --> 00:59:18,808
Just don't end it like that.

1193
00:59:18,838 --> 00:59:20,283
Don't do that to him.

1194
00:59:21,107 --> 00:59:23,178
- Because...
- Is there anything else?

1195
00:59:24,811 --> 00:59:26,222
I am sorry.

1196
00:59:27,480 --> 00:59:29,585
You...you're apologizing?

1197
00:59:29,616 --> 00:59:31,857
I am apologizing
because the way

1198
00:59:32,085 --> 00:59:33,860
I've been treating you
has been unacceptable.

1199
00:59:34,854 --> 00:59:38,165
Um, apology accepted.

1200
00:59:38,191 --> 00:59:39,329
Thank you.

1201
00:59:40,126 --> 00:59:42,231
Hey, uh...
I like your paintings.

1202
00:59:42,262 --> 00:59:45,141
- Get out.
- I'm interested.

1203
00:59:45,164 --> 00:59:46,734
Like, what's the art...

1204
00:59:46,766 --> 00:59:48,473
- Out.
- OK, I'll leave.

1205
00:59:48,501 --> 00:59:49,605
Thank you for your time.

1206
00:59:49,836 --> 00:59:51,509
I like that one, by the way.

1207
00:59:53,106 --> 00:59:58,180
[band plays, people chattering]

1208
01:00:12,592 --> 01:00:15,300
OK, come on, dude.
Even I think that's excessive.

1209
01:00:16,129 --> 01:00:17,267
Shut up, Corey.

1210
01:00:19,465 --> 01:00:20,876
- Hey.
- Hey.

1211
01:00:20,900 --> 01:00:23,380
Costume like that,
you could raise the dead.

1212
01:00:23,403 --> 01:00:25,781
[both laughing]

1213
01:00:25,805 --> 01:00:27,648
- That was funny.
- Thank you.

1214
01:00:27,674 --> 01:00:29,881
Corey used the exact
same line on me last year,

1215
01:00:29,909 --> 01:00:32,651
Wearing the exact same
douche bag costume.

1216
01:00:32,679 --> 01:00:33,817
He did?

1217
01:00:33,846 --> 01:00:35,519
Yeah...
And it didn't work then.

1218
01:00:38,518 --> 01:00:40,293
But I'm...
I'm Frankenstein.

1219
01:00:42,288 --> 01:00:43,266
Dude?

1220
01:00:44,223 --> 01:00:46,260
I'm sorry, bud, not her.

1221
01:00:46,292 --> 01:00:48,169
You gotta tell me
stuff like that.

1222
01:00:49,162 --> 01:00:50,664
Or her...

1223
01:00:51,464 --> 01:00:52,807
Or her.

1224
01:00:54,467 --> 01:00:55,605
What?!

1225
01:00:56,302 --> 01:00:57,440
Read chapter 11.

1226
01:00:57,770 --> 01:00:58,748
Dammit!

1227
01:01:00,707 --> 01:01:01,742
Hey, Luke.

1228
01:01:01,774 --> 01:01:04,414
I heard you were coming as a
cowboy, so I came as an Indian.

1229
01:01:05,178 --> 01:01:06,213
Gross.

1230
01:01:06,779 --> 01:01:07,814
I'm sorry?

1231
01:01:11,951 --> 01:01:13,487
So good to see you.

1232
01:01:13,519 --> 01:01:14,827
Uh, thanks.

1233
01:01:15,555 --> 01:01:16,693
Dad and I were wondering

1234
01:01:16,723 --> 01:01:18,430
if you're still coming
to the wedding tomorrow?

1235
01:01:18,458 --> 01:01:19,528
Wedding?

1236
01:01:19,559 --> 01:01:20,970
I'm not ready to
go to any weddings.

1237
01:01:21,194 --> 01:01:23,401
Luke, I'm trying here, OK?

1238
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:25,773
You know cowboys hate Indians?

1239
01:01:25,798 --> 01:01:28,836
Didn't know that was the point.
Does it matter?

1240
01:01:28,868 --> 01:01:30,370
Yes, it does.

1241
01:01:30,403 --> 01:01:32,349
If this was 100 ago,
I'd probably kill you.

1242
01:01:32,372 --> 01:01:35,410
Well, I'm just trying
to say I'm sorry, OK?

1243
01:01:35,441 --> 01:01:36,852
Apology accepted.

1244
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:42,323
I'm glad we're not together.

1245
01:01:43,249 --> 01:01:44,592

in the pubs of Europe.

1424
01:11:59,465 --> 01:12:00,876
Love, Kelly.

1425
01:12:06,205 --> 01:12:08,082
She's hot!

1426
01:12:08,107 --> 01:12:09,552
It's alive..

1427
01:12:09,575 --> 01:12:11,248
It's alive!

1428
01:12:17,216 --> 01:12:18,388
Corey...

1429
01:12:18,417 --> 01:12:20,090
Look who I found.

1430
01:12:21,587 --> 01:12:24,363
For us, this beer
was just the beginning.

1431
01:12:24,390 --> 01:12:26,563
More so than ever before,
we had no idea

1432
01:12:26,592 --> 01:12:28,401
Where this life
was gonna take us.

1433
01:12:28,427 --> 01:12:31,033
But what we did know
was that we had each other.

1434
01:12:31,063 --> 01:12:32,508
I guess it's all
you can ask for;

1435
01:12:32,531 --> 01:12:34,169
And frankly
that's all I need...

1436
01:12:34,199 --> 01:12:36,975
Friends that are family
and family that are friends.

1437
01:12:37,636 --> 01:12:39,411
This beer's to you.

1438
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:41,577
Cheers.
