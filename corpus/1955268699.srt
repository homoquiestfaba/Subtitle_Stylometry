00:29:38,176 --> 00:29:40,378
 Keep moving, maggots.
 Any of you puke or die

528
00:29:40,444 --> 00:29:43,214
 and I'm adding
 10 more laps.

529
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,450
 I'm glad I got
 my degree in PE.

530
00:29:48,019 --> 00:29:52,957
 Miss Saltzer,
 you get a... Oh, a D.

531
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:55,527
 Not good, Miss Saltzer.
 Not good at all.

532
00:29:56,861 --> 00:29:59,563
All right.
Dear Shredderman,

533
00:29:59,630 --> 00:30:02,767
I already loved the website
when you used it
to bring Bubba down,

534
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:05,536
but now, by exposing
all the injustices
in this school,

535
00:30:05,603 --> 00:30:07,172
you're making life
better for everyone.

536
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,240
You're my hero.

537
00:30:10,475 --> 00:30:12,476
"Keep up the good work."

538
00:30:12,543 --> 00:30:13,912
This is too good.

539
00:30:14,578 --> 00:30:16,848
Dear Isabel...

540
00:30:19,684 --> 00:30:21,085
Bubba?

541
00:30:21,151 --> 00:30:23,021
I know who you are,
Chicken Little.

542
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:26,124
And you'll be sorry
you were ever even hatched.

543
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:30,228
No.

544
00:30:30,294 --> 00:30:33,464
No way he knows it's me.
He couldn't. Could he?

545
00:30:33,530 --> 00:30:37,001
I have a firewall.
No, he's gotta be faking it.

546
00:30:37,068 --> 00:30:38,403
He has to be.

547
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:42,340
No. I'm not falling for it.

548
00:30:46,577 --> 00:30:49,580
Well, this Chicken Little

549
00:30:49,647 --> 00:30:54,551
is dropping the sky
on your head, loser.

550
00:30:54,618 --> 00:30:56,353
Take that, sucker.

551
00:30:56,420 --> 00:30:58,523
 (MUSIC PLAYING)

552
00:31:08,332 --> 00:31:10,301
Nole, everything
okay up there?

553
00:31:10,367 --> 00:31:12,503
Yeah. Just doing
some homework.

554
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:14,405
It's actually kind of fun.

555
00:31:14,471 --> 00:31:16,808
Homework, fun?
You want me to
come up there and...

556
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,276
No. No, thanks.
Fun's over.

557
00:31:18,342 --> 00:31:19,978
Back to the grind.
Thanks, Dad.

558
00:31:20,978 --> 00:31:22,447
Gotta hit the books.

559
00:31:30,821 --> 00:31:33,691
What? No.
Where's my jet pen?

560
00:31:33,758 --> 00:31:35,627
I definitely put it in here
before the bell.

561

00:31:47,638 --> 00:31:49,106
All right, that's it.

564
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,208
There's no way
you're getting away
with this, this time.

565
00:31:51,275 --> 00:31:54,278
Prepare to be shredded.

566
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:57,514
Hey, Nole,
it's awfully quiet up there,
what you doing?

567
00:31:57,581 --> 00:32:00,918
Noth... I'm splitting atoms
with Mom's hairdryer.

568
00:32:00,984 --> 00:32:04,055
Okay, buddy, keep it up.

569
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:07,324
Just hand over the jet pen
and no one gets hurt.

570
00:32:07,391 --> 00:32:11,328
Hand over the jet pen
or I'll turn mashed
potatoes into your face.

571
00:32:11,395 --> 00:32:12,797
I'll give you to
the count of three

572
00:32:12,863 --> 00:32:14,531
before I have
to call in the sheriff

573
00:32:14,598 --> 00:32:15,766
and the deputy.

574
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,268
Don't make me get backup.

575
00:32:17,335 --> 00:32:18,369
MR. BIXBY: Come on,
let's take a spin
in the dumper.

576
00:32:18,436 --> 00:32:19,303
I'll show you some
tricks of the trade.

577
00:32:19,370 --> 00:32:20,337
Sweet.

578
00:32:20,404 --> 00:32:22,340
Remember,
in the sewage business,

579
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:24,809
"Tide and time
wait for no man."

580
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:24,809
Yeah!

581
00:32:24,875 --> 00:32:28,112
These are all things to know
if all this one day
is gonna be yours.

583
00:32:30,648 --> 00:32:35,386
No, you stupendously
misinformed child.

584
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:37,388
The business.

585
00:32:37,454 --> 00:32:38,623
Right. Sorry.

586
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,391
Cool.

587
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:41,392
Let's go.

588
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:56,040
That Shredderman site's
just some stupid,
cruddy cartoon show

589
00:32:56,107 --> 00:32:58,075
some no-life loser
at school made up.

590
00:32:58,142 --> 00:32:59,610
And you don't know
who's behind it.

00:32:59,676 --> 00:33:01,612
Oh, yeah...

All right. All right.
Don't let it get you down.

595
00:33:08,519 --> 00:33:10,621
Desperate little
people always take
cheap shots

596
00:33:10,687 --> 00:33:12,389
at big people like us.

597
00:33:12,456 --> 00:33:14,458
Bubba, they're jealous of us.

598
00:33:14,525 --> 00:33:15,626
Yeah?

599
00:33:15,692 --> 00:33:17,327
Look at the two of us.

Me, I'm good-looking,
I'm rich, I'm smart.

You, you take
after your mother.

is working on a plan
to outsmart the entire town.

You are?

606
00:33:35,779 --> 00:33:38,048
Yes.

607
00:33:38,115 --> 00:33:39,450
I've generously
offered to rebuild

608
00:33:39,516 --> 00:33:40,851
the old water
reclamation plant

609
00:33:40,917 --> 00:33:42,653
down by the pond.

610
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:44,355
Once I have
the town's support
for my phony eco-mission,

611
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:46,423
I'll enact my real plan.

612
00:33:46,490 --> 00:33:49,026
A plan that gives me
access to a pond.

613
00:33:49,092 --> 00:33:54,598
A pond that I can use
for my own advantage,
if you catch my drift.

Oh, yeah!

I don't catch it.

616
00:33:59,503 --> 00:34:00,671
What's important
is that you understand

617
00:34:00,738 --> 00:34:02,006
that your old man
is trying to build

618
00:34:02,072 --> 00:34:05,242
a sewage dynasty
that stretches from
sea to shining sea.

619
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:07,912
And then one day,
one glorious day,

620

whenever anybody
hears the name Bixby,

621
00:34:11,716 --> 00:34:13,050
they'll think of crap.

622
00:34:13,117 --> 00:34:15,686

701
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:03,046
Well, what's the story
with the pond?

702
00:38:03,113 --> 00:38:06,683
Well, Mr. Bixby is
getting final approval

703
00:38:06,750 --> 00:38:10,821
to renovate the historic
water reclamation plant
at the pond.

704
00:38:10,887 --> 00:38:13,690
There's gonna be a big
groundbreaking ceremony.

705
00:38:13,757 --> 00:38:16,827
The Mayor's going to be there.
It's gonna be quite a hoo-ha.

706
00:38:16,894 --> 00:38:17,995
Hoo-ha?

707
00:38:18,061 --> 00:38:19,630
Yeah, you know...

708
00:38:19,697 --> 00:38:24,668
You see, Bixby says
he wants to give something
back to the town

709
00:38:24,735 --> 00:38:28,071
and in exchange
the town will
grant him the deed

710
00:38:28,138 --> 00:38:30,874
to the surrounding parkland,
which he'll beautify

711
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:33,210
as part of his
new eco-mission.

712
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:34,811
Bixby made his
money in sewage.

713
00:38:34,878 --> 00:38:36,681
Since when is he into
making plants happy?

714
00:38:37,548 --> 00:38:38,949
Something stinks.

715
00:38:39,016 --> 00:38:41,251
Oh, I'm sorry,
I just burped
my anchovy pizza.

716
00:38:41,318 --> 00:38:43,386
Something stinks
with the pond deal, Dad.

717
00:38:43,453 --> 00:38:46,356
I mean, what if
his supposed reclamation
system hurts the pond?

718
00:38:46,423 --> 00:38:50,394
Well, Nolan, he's got oodles
and oodles of studies here,

719
00:38:50,461 --> 00:38:52,629
saying it's perfectly safe.

720
00:38:52,696 --> 00:38:56,266
It's all right here
in black and white.

721
00:38:56,333 --> 00:39:01,771
Look, Nolan,
I know how much
you love the pond.

722
00:39:01,838 --> 00:39:04,007
And I also know
how much you
dislike the Bixbys.

723
00:39:04,074 --> 00:39:07,611
But believe it or not,
Bob Bixby is doing
this town a favor.

724
00:39:07,678 --> 00:39:09,980
A very expensive favor.

725
00:39:12,349 --> 00:39:17,421
So, Nolan, just remember,
the first rule of journalism
is objectivity.

726
00:39:17,488 --> 00:39:20,424
You see, you have
to maintain a certain...

727
00:39:22,026 --> 00:39:23,127
Nolan?

728
00:39:36,140 --> 00:39:37,441
(SCREAMS)

729
00:39:41,211 --> 00:39:43,981
Why?

730
00:39:44,048 --> 00:39:46,183
Sorry. Sorry.

731
00:39:46,249 --> 00:39:47,885
It's not fair.

732
00:39:47,951 --> 00:39:50,354
I mean,
we've been taking care
of this park for years,

733
00:39:50,420 --> 00:39:52,088
and now Bixby gets it?

734
00:39:52,155 --> 00:39:54,658
Someone like Bixby
shouldn't even be
allowed to walk by it,

735
00:39:54,725 --> 00:39:56,961
much less have
responsibility for it.

736
00:39:58,562 --> 00:39:59,930
I don't trust him.

737
00:39:59,996 --> 00:40:03,600
And the sad part is,
we can yell and
scream all we want.

738
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:06,437
But the truth is,
Isabel Lopez or Tina Atkins

739
00:40:06,504 --> 00:40:09,506
can't do a thing to stop Bixby
from taking over this place.

740
00:40:09,573 --> 00:40:11,074
Yeah.

741
00:40:11,141 --> 00:40:13,177
(MUMBLING)
Bixby... And the pond...

742
00:40:14,678 --> 00:40:17,081
Sure, Nolan.
It's like what he said.

744
00:40:24,087 --> 00:40:25,689
Isabel's right.

745
00:40:25,756 --> 00:40:28,826
Nolan Byrd
can't save the pond
from Bixby's clutches.

746
00:40:30,727 --> 00:40:32,630
But Shredderman can.

747
00:40:44,141 --> 00:40:47,545
"Doesn't Mr. Bixby's
eco-mission stink
of yesterday's sewage?"

748
00:40:47,611 --> 00:40:49,045
I love it.

749
00:40:49,112 --> 00:40:51,181
Finally,

to ask the tough questions.

Bubba's dad's number.

"Bixby smells of deceit,
and he who smelled it
dealt it."

754
00:41:02,726 --> 00:41:04,294
I just hope Shredderman
knows what he's doing,

755
00:41:04,361 --> 00:41:06,797
putting all those accusations
and stuff on the site.

756
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:09,032
Bixby's dad doesn't
seem all that nice.

757
00:41:09,099 --> 00:41:11,268
I mean, Shredderman could
really be in trouble.

758
00:41:11,334 --> 00:41:13,003
Are you kidding?

759
00:41:13,069 --> 00:41:15,972
Shredderman can stand up
to a hack like Bixby.

760
00:41:16,039 --> 00:41:19,276
Brains will always
conquer brawn.

761
00:41:19,343 --> 00:41:22,613
If anyone thinks
that Shredderman
doesn't have brains,

762
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:25,916
they're going to get
their butt kicked by  moi.

Well, as you all know,
tomorrow is our field trip
to the pond.

768
00:41:49,506 --> 00:41:50,707
Yeah!

00:41:49,506 --> 00:41:50,707

It's going to be great.

00:41:52,108 --> 00:41:54,578
Now, don't forget to pack
your lunches, okay?

772
00:41:54,645 --> 00:41:59,082
And just in case you care,
I love egg salad,

773
00:41:59,149 --> 00:42:02,452
and whole grain is
good for the heart, too.

Claudette.

on how pets

Nolan, Claudette.

I like to have
my fuzzy stomach
rubbed, too.

782

No, no. My guinea pig, Diego,
he likes to have his
fuzzy stomach rubbed.

783
00:42:36,453 --> 00:42:39,322
Well, then you should both
be nice and relaxed.

784
00:42:39,389 --> 00:42:43,660
Okay, now think of something
that you care about.

Something that
calms you down.

00:42:47,464 --> 00:42:48,999
I like the pond.

What?

788
00:42:50,934 --> 00:42:53,003
Okay, now pet Claudette.

calming you down.

As most of you are aware,

a certain website is making
outlandish accusations

about one of our most
outstanding citizens,
Mr. Bixby.

but to order
an immediate search

report to their lockers
now and wait there

really traumatic.

into their stuff?

think about all this?

864
00:47:58,174 --> 00:48:01,178
I agree.
I don't wanna hear
about the dressing room.

865

I was talking
about Mr. Green.

I'm not sure what
I think anymore.

Well, here goes everything.

868
00:48:19,095 --> 00:48:25,435
As we all know,
Mr. Green has been unfairly
removed from our school.

Hey, Mrs. Smith.

1211
01:06:10,066 --> 01:06:13,502
Nolan, how nice to see you.

1212
01:06:13,569 --> 01:06:15,804
Mr. Smith and I
have been wondering
how you've been.

1213
01:06:15,871 --> 01:06:17,206
Fine. Just fine.

1214
01:06:17,272 --> 01:06:18,607
Is Max around?

1215
01:06:18,673 --> 01:06:21,076
Oh, sure. You know him,
doing his homework as usual.

1216
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:22,445
Thanks.

1217
01:06:32,054 --> 01:06:33,555
Doing homework, huh?

1218
01:06:33,622 --> 01:06:34,557
Huh?

1219
01:06:35,624 --> 01:06:38,026
Never could beat me
at that game.

said something to me.

Must I remind you,
you proposed to me?

1226
01:06:51,273 --> 01:06:52,908
Do you want the whole school
to know about that?

1227

ever believe you.

it's not too late.

Bubba brought
her here yesterday.

Hopefully she
hasn't been sold.

the best in a person.

I want to be the best for.

01:07:49,031 --> 01:07:50,099
I want that guinea pig.

1246
01:07:50,166 --> 01:07:51,867
Sorry, dude.
I just sold it.

have a black spot

This guinea pig
isn't yours.

I'll report you.

She's better off
with you anyway.
Take her.

one of those.

It was mine.

01:08:18,560 --> 01:08:20,595
I had to.

01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:28,750
 NOLAN: Things were even
 different for Bubba.

1558
01:26:31,953 --> 01:26:34,522
Hey, Miriam,
I love your hair.

1559
01:26:36,591 --> 01:26:38,459
Would you like to
go out sometime?

1560
01:26:40,628 --> 01:26:42,263
 NOLAN: Just kidding.

1561
01:26:44,431 --> 01:26:47,302
Hey, Miriam,
I hear guys keep
taking you out.

1562
01:26:47,368 --> 01:26:49,837
But you seem to find
your way back home.

1563
01:26:49,904 --> 01:26:51,172
(LAUGHS)

1564
01:26:51,239 --> 01:26:53,341
That is so funny.

1565
01:26:54,475 --> 01:26:56,143
Did you guys hear that?
So good. So good.

1566
01:26:56,210 --> 01:26:58,479
 NOLAN: Bubba was gonna be
 Bubba till the day he died.

1567
01:26:58,546 --> 01:27:01,415
 But what had changed
 was the way we all
 dealt with him.

1568
01:27:01,482 --> 01:27:03,484
BUBBA: Good times.

1569
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:05,319
 And as for me? Well...

1570
01:27:05,386 --> 01:27:07,321
Nolan. Nolan. Guess what.

1571
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:09,156
Claudette is pregnant.

1572
01:27:07,388 --> 01:27:09,156
Huh?

1573
01:27:09,223 --> 01:27:12,627
Claudette is
going to have babies.
Isn't that cool?

1574
01:27:12,694 --> 01:27:14,829
I just wish I knew
how that happened.

1575
01:27:22,203 --> 01:27:23,838
A miracle, I guess.

1576
01:27:25,540 --> 01:27:27,608
I'm so glad
Shredderman
saved the pond.

1577
01:27:27,674 --> 01:27:31,345
He showed up just in time,
in true superhero fashion.

1578
01:27:31,412 --> 01:27:33,647
Oh, you would
have loved it, Nolan.

1579
01:27:33,714 --> 01:27:37,652
You know, he seems
to care about all
the same things you do.

1580
01:27:39,253 --> 01:27:41,021
Really?

1581
01:27:41,088 --> 01:27:42,890
Funny how you
and Shredderman
are never around

1582
01:27:42,956 --> 01:27:44,125
at the same time.

1583
01:27:44,191 --> 01:27:45,460
Um...

1584
01:27:45,526 --> 01:27:47,227
Scheduling conflicts,
I guess.

1585
01:27:47,294 --> 01:27:48,396
Oh.

1586
01:27:51,132 --> 01:27:53,534
Well, see you later.

1587
01:27:55,502 --> 01:27:57,005
Isabel?

1588
01:27:55,502 --> 01:27:57,005
Yes?

1589
01:27:58,505 --> 01:28:01,008
(STAMMERING)
I was wondering...

1590
01:28:01,074 --> 01:28:02,677
Right...

1591
01:28:02,743 --> 01:28:04,612
If...

1592
01:28:02,743 --> 01:28:04,612
If...

1593
01:28:05,412 --> 01:28:06,680
You...

1594
01:28:06,747 --> 01:28:07,749
I...

1595
01:28:09,450 --> 01:28:10,984
If you would...

1596
01:28:11,051 --> 01:28:13,620
You can do this.

1597
01:28:13,687 --> 01:28:15,857
If you'd like to go hang out
at the pond tomorrow?

1598
01:28:15,923 --> 01:28:17,925
I did it. I'm the man.

1599
01:28:17,992 --> 01:28:19,460
Nolan?

1600
01:28:19,527 --> 01:28:21,129
I've waited nine years
for this moment.

1601
01:28:21,195 --> 01:28:22,796
I asked Isabel out.

1602
01:28:22,863 --> 01:28:24,465
Yo.

1603
01:28:24,532 --> 01:28:26,801
I didn't even give
you an answer yet.

1604
01:28:27,935 --> 01:28:29,504
Oh, right.

1605
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:31,238
So do you want to?

1606
01:28:29,570 --> 01:28:31,238
Yes.

1607
01:28:31,305 --> 01:28:32,573
Awesome.

1608
01:28:32,639 --> 01:28:35,442
Nolan Byrd,
you are so weird.

1609
