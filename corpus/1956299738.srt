177
00:11:55,549 --> 00:11:58,302
You've obviously
never been to Ohio.

178
00:11:59,595 --> 00:12:01,388
I don't travel much.

179
00:12:01,389 --> 00:12:02,806
You work at an airport.

180
00:12:02,807 --> 00:12:06,476
- I've never flown.
- What? Really?

181
00:12:06,477 --> 00:12:10,605
I...
How is that even possible?

182
00:12:10,606 --> 00:12:13,608
You, my friend, are a disgrace
to the aviation industry.

183
00:12:13,609 --> 00:12:15,069
[laughs]

184
00:12:16,445 --> 00:12:19,280
So, what do you
write in there?

185
00:12:19,281 --> 00:12:22,242
Oh, um, stuff, you know.

186
00:12:22,243 --> 00:12:24,078
Sounds like a bestseller.

187
00:12:26,247 --> 00:12:29,082
[woman on PA]
<i>Calvin Lewis to the information desk.</i>

188
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,959
<i>Calvin Lewis to
the information desk.</i>

189
00:12:30,960 --> 00:12:34,337
- That's me.
- Guess you should go then.

190
00:12:34,338 --> 00:12:35,840
I'm Izzy.

191
00:12:37,842 --> 00:12:39,885
- Um...
- Um...

192
00:12:41,887 --> 00:12:43,097
OK.

193
00:12:43,806 --> 00:12:44,682
See ya.

194
00:12:58,070 --> 00:13:00,781
Hi, I'm Calvin Lewis.

195
00:13:04,910 --> 00:13:07,328
- Hi, Calvin!
- [Calvin] Hi.

196
00:13:07,329 --> 00:13:09,414
- [Skye] Hi.
- What are you doing here?

197
00:13:09,415 --> 00:13:10,790
Oh, you dropped this
at the meeting.

198
00:13:10,791 --> 00:13:12,459
Oh, you have another one.

199
00:13:12,460 --> 00:13:13,752
[Calvin] Do you not have,
like, school?

200
00:13:13,753 --> 00:13:15,044
Is this your ride?

201
00:13:15,045 --> 00:13:16,463
- Wow.
- Yes.

202
00:13:16,464 --> 00:13:18,298
- Can I take it for a spin?
- No.

203
00:13:18,299 --> 00:13:19,257
- Please?
- No.

204
00:13:19,258 --> 00:13:20,633
But I'm dying.

205
00:13:20,634 --> 00:13:23,720
OK, it's not insured
for civilians, so...

206
00:13:23,721 --> 00:13:26,139
Civilians? Oh, come on,
I'm not gonna sue.

207
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:27,932
- Cross my heart and hope to...
- Skye.

208
00:13:27,933 --> 00:13:29,893
So, are you one of these guys

209
00:13:29,894 --> 00:13:33,229
that's always going on strike
and breaking people's stuff?

210
00:13:33,230 --> 00:13:34,689
[groans] No.

211
00:13:34,690 --> 00:13:37,609
Have you ever gone through
someone's luggage?

212
00:13:37,610 --> 00:13:39,360
What's the weirdest thing
you've ever found?

213
00:13:39,361 --> 00:13:41,529
I bet you've found some
filthy things, haven't you?

214
00:13:41,530 --> 00:13:43,490
Go on, you can tell me, I'm
really good at keeping secrets.

215
00:13:43,491 --> 00:13:46,993
- I'm about to go on shift, so...
- Oh, amazing, I will come with.

216
00:13:46,994 --> 00:13:48,829
What?
No, I'm...

217
00:13:49,914 --> 00:13:51,332
Is that a goldfish?

218
00:13:52,249 --> 00:13:54,125
Yeah, he's for you.

219
00:13:54,126 --> 00:13:55,627
This is Boris.

220
00:13:55,628 --> 00:13:57,295
But you can call him
whatever you want

221
00:13:57,296 --> 00:13:59,214
because, you know, the whole
three second memory thing.

222
00:13:59,215 --> 00:14:01,008
Oh, my God.
Um...

223
00:14:01,926 --> 00:14:04,761
Why are you here?

224
00:14:04,762 --> 00:14:08,431
You are just as bad as Boris.
I'm here to return your ID.

225
00:14:08,432 --> 00:14:10,058
OK.
Thank you.

226
00:14:10,059 --> 00:14:13,729
Um... now,
could you please go?

227
00:14:14,939 --> 00:14:16,649
I mean, I could.

228
00:14:18,984 --> 00:14:20,652
Look, I'm sorry
to be blunt, OK?

229
00:14:20,653 --> 00:14:22,654
It's just the way I am.

230
00:14:22,655 --> 00:14:24,072
But if you're gonna beat
this thing, you're gonna

231
00:14:24,073 --> 00:14:25,532
have to grow a pair.

232
00:14:25,533 --> 00:14:27,325
You don't have cancer of
the balls, do you? Because that

233
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:28,409
would make me kind of a dick.

234
00:14:28,410 --> 00:14:30,245
- No, I do not have...
- Oh, thank God.

235
00:14:30,246 --> 00:14:33,540
OK, so we start tomorrow.

236
00:14:33,541 --> 00:14:36,042
- Start what?
- My to-die list.

237
00:14:36,043 --> 00:14:38,670
It's like a bucket list
but not as lame.

238
00:14:38,671 --> 00:14:40,713
Don't worry, I'm not gonna
drag you to Amsterdam.

239
00:14:40,714 --> 00:14:43,800
- I've got work tomorrow, so...
- Play the cancer card.

240
00:14:43,801 --> 00:14:44,802
Cancer card?

241
00:14:46,011 --> 00:14:47,012
I have cancer.

242
00:14:49,807 --> 00:14:51,641
Sometimes they give you money.

243
00:14:51,642 --> 00:14:53,142
- So what do you say?
- Um...

244
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:55,813
Are you down or are you down?
Mm! Let's do this.

245
00:14:56,438 --> 00:14:58,815
Um...

246
00:14:58,816 --> 00:15:00,900
I'll meet you
at the fountain at four.

247
00:15:00,901 --> 00:15:03,237
Take good care of Boris!

248
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:08,324
So, Lucy, seriously,
what do you think?

249
00:15:08,325 --> 00:15:10,535
On time, week early, week late?

250
00:15:10,536 --> 00:15:13,204
No, no, no, no, just pick a day.
Pick a day.

251
00:15:13,205 --> 00:15:16,875
- Wait, what are you guys doing?
- It's a gentleman's bet.

252
00:15:16,876 --> 00:15:18,626
Just trying to get a gauge.

253
00:15:18,627 --> 00:15:22,005
OK. The baby's gonna come
when it's gonna come, Bob.

254
00:15:22,006 --> 00:15:25,633
OK, well, just so you know,
these Lewis boys all came late.

255
00:15:25,634 --> 00:15:26,886
Isn't that right, Ellen?

256
00:15:32,057 --> 00:15:35,561
So, you gonna head back
to college next year?

257
00:15:36,645 --> 00:15:37,812
I don't know.

258
00:15:37,813 --> 00:15:39,689
Haven't really thought about it.

259
00:15:39,690 --> 00:15:42,191
Figured after six months at the
airport, you'd be running back.

260
00:15:42,192 --> 00:15:45,278
You know, I don't mind
working there.

261
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,488
Twelve hour shifts,
back-breaking labor?

262
00:15:47,489 --> 00:15:48,531
Yeah, what's not to like?

263
00:15:48,532 --> 00:15:50,074
All right, take it easy.

264
00:15:50,075 --> 00:15:52,619
[scoffs] How's that
working out for ya?

265
00:15:52,620 --> 00:15:54,287
You can stay here
as long as you like.

266
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:56,831
- His tests came back clean.
- Leave him alone.

267
00:15:56,832 --> 00:15:59,626
No, no, no, you just spent money
that you don't have,

268
00:15:59,627 --> 00:16:02,086
testing for something
that he never had.

269
00:16:02,087 --> 00:16:03,881
Thanks for dinner.

270
00:16:16,769 --> 00:16:20,605
Ashley, please tell me
Will is coming to your party.

271
00:16:20,606 --> 00:16:21,815
Did someone say "party"?

272
00:16:22,858 --> 00:16:24,068
Skye.

273
00:16:25,861 --> 00:16:28,571
You look like you seen a ghost.

274
00:16:28,572 --> 00:16:30,823
Just haven't seen
you around lately.

275
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:32,867
Been busy.

276
00:16:32,868 --> 00:16:35,703
Who knew dying could be
so time-consuming?

277
00:16:35,704 --> 00:16:38,332
So... we've gotta go.

278
00:16:39,333 --> 00:16:41,042
You coming, Ashley?

279
00:16:41,043 --> 00:16:42,585
[Ashley] I'll catch up
with you guys.

280
00:16:42,586 --> 00:16:45,339
OK. See you, Skye.

281
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:51,345
So, I'm having a party
this weekend.

282
00:16:52,054 --> 00:16:53,137
Cool.

283
00:16:53,138 --> 00:16:54,764
You should come.

284
00:16:54,765 --> 00:16:56,933
If I have the time, sure.

285
00:16:56,934 --> 00:16:58,602
Cool.

286
00:17:00,980 --> 00:17:03,440
I should catch up with them.

287
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:05,442
- Right.
- Bye.

288
00:17:12,741 --> 00:17:14,743
I thought we were
meeting by the fountain.

289
00:17:15,536 --> 00:17:16,704
You came.

290
00:17:17,913 --> 00:17:19,747
- You OK?
- I have cancer.

291
00:17:19,748 --> 00:17:22,125
Right... about that...

292
00:17:22,126 --> 00:17:25,336
- Less talk, more shopping.
- [Calvin] OK.

293
00:17:25,337 --> 00:17:27,088
[Skye] You know, it's kinda
creepy that you're hanging out

294
00:17:27,089 --> 00:17:29,550
outside the ladies'
changing room.

295
00:17:32,261 --> 00:17:33,262
I'm fine.

296
00:17:36,932 --> 00:17:39,017
So, how long you
been in the States?

297
00:17:39,018 --> 00:17:41,645
Dad moved us here
when I was ten.

298
00:17:43,480 --> 00:17:44,605
You at Kingston High?

299
00:17:44,606 --> 00:17:46,524
East Kingston.

300
00:17:46,525 --> 00:17:48,568
Go Bluebirds, whoo.

301
00:17:48,569 --> 00:17:50,820
Skye, you know,

302
00:17:50,821 --> 00:17:53,448
- something I should tell you...
- Let's go.

303
00:17:53,449 --> 00:17:56,117
The kind of support group thing
we were at?

304
00:17:56,118 --> 00:17:59,662
- Can you run in those shoes?
- I don't... What?

305
00:17:59,663 --> 00:18:01,581
Never mind.
Hold this.

306
00:18:01,582 --> 00:18:04,417
What's in it?
Skye.

307
00:18:04,418 --> 00:18:06,044
[Skye] Run!

308
00:18:06,045 --> 00:18:07,129
Run?

309
00:18:08,088 --> 00:18:08,922
Oh.

310
00:18:09,965 --> 00:18:11,425
[taser buzzing]

311
00:18:14,553 --> 00:18:16,012
Wow.

312
00:18:16,013 --> 00:18:19,557
Doesn't even match.

313
00:18:19,558 --> 00:18:22,977
[woman] That is some stone cold
pervert 101 shit right there.

314
00:18:22,978 --> 00:18:26,856
Wait a minute.
I knew I recognized you,

315
00:18:26,857 --> 00:18:28,691
I never forget a face.

316
00:18:28,692 --> 00:18:31,110
This guy goes to my old man's
cancer support group.

317
00:18:31,111 --> 00:18:32,153
No shit.

318
00:18:32,154 --> 00:18:35,490
Oh, new meds, right?

319
00:18:35,491 --> 00:18:37,283
When my old man's
medications change,

320
00:18:37,284 --> 00:18:38,951
he goes batshit crazy too.

321
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:40,369
[woman] Come on, you
should have said something.

322
00:18:40,370 --> 00:18:42,288
All right, get up,
boy, you're OK.

323
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,123
All right, not your fault.

324
00:18:44,124 --> 00:18:47,461
Not your fault.
OK, case closed.

325
00:18:48,962 --> 00:18:50,338
Hey.

326
00:18:50,339 --> 00:18:53,675
You fight this shit,
you hear me?

327
00:18:59,515 --> 00:19:01,307
- Yeah!
- [Calvin grunts]

328
00:19:01,308 --> 00:19:03,768
That was so balls-out amazing!

329
00:19:03,769 --> 00:19:05,853
- You get off me!
- They full on tasered you!

330
00:19:05,854 --> 00:19:07,563
I can't believe that
wasn't on my list!

331
00:19:07,564 --> 00:19:08,356
You set me up!

332
00:19:08,357 --> 00:19:09,398
I told you to run.

333
00:19:09,399 --> 00:19:10,483
I could have been arrested!

334
00:19:10,484 --> 00:19:12,443
And I could have lived to 102.

335
00:19:12,444 --> 00:19:15,071
You stole some shit,
you got away with it.

336
00:19:15,072 --> 00:19:16,489
Just enjoy the moment.

337
00:19:16,490 --> 00:19:18,533
OK, so you got tasered.

338
00:19:18,534 --> 00:19:22,036
And pissed yourself? Eww.

339
00:19:22,037 --> 00:19:24,080
But you did something
you've never done before.

340
00:19:24,081 --> 00:19:25,998
Doesn't that feel good?

341
00:19:25,999 --> 00:19:27,543
Admit it, it's a rush.

342
00:19:28,585 --> 00:19:29,920
Give me your hand.

343
00:19:31,338 --> 00:19:32,380
Feel that?

344
00:19:32,381 --> 00:19:34,423
Do you feel that?

345
00:19:34,424 --> 00:19:36,634
- Yes.
- [Skye] What does that mean?

346
00:19:36,635 --> 00:19:37,844
Means I'm alive.

347
00:19:37,845 --> 00:19:40,721
No, Calvin, it means
you're a pussy.

348
00:19:40,722 --> 00:19:42,682
How do you expect
to beat a lie detector test

349
00:19:42,683 --> 00:19:44,183
if you can't regulate
your heartbeat?

350
00:19:44,184 --> 00:19:46,435
Why would I need

I used to think you were cool,
Calvin, but you're not.

354
00:19:54,528 --> 00:19:56,070
Don't ever call me again.

355
00:19:56,071 --> 00:19:58,115
I don't even have your number.

356

on, come on, come on, come on.

Does what's-her-name
have a name?

367
00:22:09,288 --> 00:22:10,830
Izzy.

No.

Skye, I need to
tell you something.

372
00:22:18,005 --> 00:22:19,547
You're a virgin, I know.

373
00:22:19,548 --> 00:22:21,007
I'm not a virgin.

- Really?
- Why?

I... I'm just surprised.
You kinda have that aura.

Now can you be serious
about something?

377
00:22:27,180 --> 00:22:29,473
I can be serious
about finding Izzy.

378
00:22:29,474 --> 00:22:30,892
Get off the road!

379
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:34,937

take any selfies.

what's on the inside.

383
00:22:42,070 --> 00:22:45,323
Do you think
she's too cool for me?

384

Drive up there

I see her all the time.

What if she says no?

396
00:23:53,058 --> 00:23:55,184
When you call her,
ask her what she's wearing.

this was a costume party.

00:31:22,090 --> 00:31:24,550
Skye, get in the car.

525
00:31:24,551 --> 00:31:26,051
Stranger danger!

526
00:31:26,052 --> 00:31:28,720
- Stranger danger!
- Can you keep your voice down?

527
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:29,848
[whispers] Stranger danger.

528
00:31:30,723 --> 00:31:32,432
Skye.

529
00:31:32,433 --> 00:31:34,435
Ashley knows how much
I like him.

530
00:31:35,228 --> 00:31:36,604
Skye, please.

531
00:31:37,814 --> 00:31:39,731
Your parents are gonna kill me.

532
00:31:39,732 --> 00:31:42,442
I don't feel so good.

533
00:31:42,443 --> 00:31:45,070
- Are you...? No, don't, don't!
- [vomiting]

534
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:47,156
[groans]

535
00:31:53,830 --> 00:31:58,041
- [woman] Hey, Bob.
- Hi, girl. How you feeling?

536
00:31:58,042 --> 00:31:59,377
You wanna hop up front?

537
00:32:00,169 --> 00:32:01,337
I'm good.

538
00:32:01,546 --> 00:32:03,089
- Okay.
- Hey.

539
00:32:21,649 --> 00:32:23,901
[Skye] Hey, Calvin.

540
00:32:23,902 --> 00:32:27,487
- [Calvin] Skye.
- Back from the dead.

541
00:32:27,488 --> 00:32:29,948
- Are you OK?
- No thanks to you.

542
00:32:29,949 --> 00:32:32,117
"Come to the party", you said.
"It'll be fun."

543
00:32:32,118 --> 00:32:35,246
- No, you invited me.
- [Skye] Tomato, tomahto.

544
00:32:38,875 --> 00:32:40,876
Are your parents mad at me?

545
00:32:40,877 --> 00:32:43,295
You left me on the porch
and ran away.

546
00:32:43,296 --> 00:32:45,088
You completely
bailed on me, man.

547
00:32:45,089 --> 00:32:47,674
Well, you shouldn't have
put me in that position, Skye.

548
00:32:47,675 --> 00:32:49,968
Do you know how worried I was?

549
00:32:49,969 --> 00:32:52,262
No, Calvin, I must
have missed your calls.

550
00:32:52,263 --> 00:32:53,472
Is this a game to you?

551
00:32:53,473 --> 00:32:55,223
I'm dying.

552
00:32:55,224 --> 00:32:56,558
You can't keep
pulling that on me.

553
00:32:56,559 --> 00:32:59,686
No, Calvin, I mean I'm dying.

554
00:32:59,687 --> 00:33:02,147
What am I supposed to do,
curl up in a ball and cry?

555
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:04,983
I've done that,
all right? I just...

556
00:33:04,984 --> 00:33:07,736
I wanted to have some fun.
I'm sorry I ruined your life.

557
00:33:07,737 --> 00:33:10,447
I mean, you were doing great
before I came along.

558
00:33:10,448 --> 00:33:13,116
[Izzy] Hey, guys.

559
00:33:13,117 --> 00:33:16,161
- Izzy.
- Hey, girlfriend.

560
00:33:16,162 --> 00:33:18,872
- What's up?
- Did you call that number?

561
00:33:18,873 --> 00:33:20,666
They're sending out
the information.

562
00:33:20,667 --> 00:33:23,418
I think you'll be a great
flight attendant someday.

563
00:33:23,419 --> 00:33:25,837
Maybe you can even get
your brother to fly with you.

564
00:33:25,838 --> 00:33:27,881
- [softly] Brother?
- [Skye] That's the dream.

565
00:33:27,882 --> 00:33:30,050
- Join us, sit down.
- [Calvin] Skye.

566
00:33:30,051 --> 00:33:32,135
I really should get going.

567
00:33:32,136 --> 00:33:33,929
Boyfriend waiting for you?

568
00:33:33,930 --> 00:33:38,183
No, no, no boyfriend.

569
00:33:38,184 --> 00:33:39,393
[clears throat]

570
00:33:39,394 --> 00:33:42,896
Well, what are you waiting for?
Pull up a pew.

571
00:33:42,897 --> 00:33:45,941
OK.
Just for a second maybe.

572
00:33:45,942 --> 00:33:49,903
Have you tried these muffins?
They are to die for.

573
00:33:49,904 --> 00:33:52,864
- Um... OK.
- [Skye] So, Izzy.

574
00:33:52,865 --> 00:33:55,158
I've got this dilemma.

575
00:33:55,159 --> 00:33:58,453
There's, like, this boy
that I really like

576
00:33:58,454 --> 00:34:01,206
and I want to go on a date
with him, like, so bad,

577
00:34:01,207 --> 00:34:04,376
but our parents are being all
psychotically parental about it.

578
00:34:04,377 --> 00:34:06,545
Anyway, long story short,

579
00:34:06,546 --> 00:34:08,714
I can't go without a chaperone.

580
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:13,969
So I came here to beg my big
brother to help his sister out.

581
00:34:13,970 --> 00:34:16,847
Calvin here thinks
it's way too late

582
00:34:16,848 --> 00:34:19,933
to ask someone and...
[gasps] Oh, my God.

583
00:34:19,934 --> 00:34:22,894
- You guys should go together.
- [Calvin] Skye.

584
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:24,271
Not like a "date" date,
that would be weird,

585
00:34:24,272 --> 00:34:25,313
you guys just met,

586
00:34:25,314 --> 00:34:26,398
but, FYI, if you wanted to,
like,

587
00:34:26,399 --> 00:34:27,899
you could totally
pull that off.

588
00:34:27,900 --> 00:34:29,026
[Calvin clears throat]

589
00:34:29,027 --> 00:34:30,652
Just go, you know,
as colleagues.

590
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:33,739
We're not exactly "colleagues".

591
00:34:33,740 --> 00:34:35,407
Aren't we all colleagues,
though?

592
00:34:35,408 --> 00:34:37,409
You know, like when you
really think about it?

593
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,578
- [Calvin clears throat]
- Huh.

594
00:34:39,579 --> 00:34:40,788
Hm?

595
00:34:42,206 --> 00:34:43,874
- Please? Please?
- Well...

596
00:34:43,875 --> 00:34:46,084
Please, please, please,
please, please, please?

597
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:48,003
Oh, I would love to help,

598
00:34:48,004 --> 00:34:50,881
but I've had a crazy week
and I just...

599
00:34:50,882 --> 00:34:52,925
- [gasping]
- What did I say?

600
00:34:55,636 --> 00:34:57,095
There's no way
she could have known.

601
00:34:57,096 --> 00:34:58,598
Known what?

602
00:35:00,475 --> 00:35:01,809
You tell her.

603
00:35:03,186 --> 00:35:04,645
Tell me what?

604
00:35:07,231 --> 00:35:08,900
I have cancer.

605
00:35:11,194 --> 00:35:14,404
It's a rare strand,
I don't have much time left.

606
00:35:14,405 --> 00:35:17,407
I don't know what to say.

607
00:35:17,408 --> 00:35:19,035
[Skye] You don't
have to say anything.

608
00:35:20,119 --> 00:35:21,370
Just come to the movies with us.

609
00:35:27,919 --> 00:35:29,462
[Izzy] What just happened?

610
00:35:30,505 --> 00:35:31,881
(announcer)
<i>Thank you for choosing Starlight Cinema</i>

611
00:35:32,090 --> 00:35:35,675
[clears throat] You look
nice out of uniform.

612
00:35:35,676 --> 00:35:37,552
I don't look nice in uniform?

613
00:35:37,553 --> 00:35:39,763
Well, no.
I mean, I didn't, I...

614
00:35:39,764 --> 00:35:40,932
[laughs]

615
00:35:41,849 --> 00:35:43,601
(announcer)
<i>Please silence your cell phones</i>

616
00:35:43,810 --> 00:35:46,062
<i>and refrain from texting during the movie.</i>

617
00:35:46,437 --> 00:35:48,855
Maybe you should
try Skye again.

618
00:35:48,856 --> 00:35:51,983
She does stuff like this
all the time.

619
00:35:51,984 --> 00:35:54,070
Like pretend
she's your sister?

620
00:35:55,738 --> 00:35:57,280
Yeah.

621
00:35:57,281 --> 00:35:59,324
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

622
00:35:59,325 --> 00:36:00,910
I'm sure she's fine.

623
00:36:02,495 --> 00:36:04,830
But she really
is sick, right?

624
00:36:04,831 --> 00:36:08,501
Yeah, um, we met at some
cancer support group.

625
00:36:10,503 --> 00:36:11,670
Oh, my God.

626
00:36:11,671 --> 00:36:14,464
- I had no idea.
- No, I...

627
00:36:14,465 --> 00:36:17,092
Yo, yo, yo, make some room
for your girl Skye.

628
00:36:17,093 --> 00:36:19,052
What up, peeps? Miss me?

629
00:36:19,053 --> 00:36:22,389
- Jig is up, Skye.
- Bollocks.

630
00:36:22,390 --> 00:36:25,101
- You're late.
- [Skye] Shh, it's starting.

631
00:36:34,819 --> 00:36:36,236
A little thank you
would be nice.

632
00:36:36,237 --> 00:36:38,572
What, for ruining
my chances with Izzy?

633
00:36:38,573 --> 00:36:41,116
Oh, come on, I set you guys up.
I'm like a postmodern Cupid.

634
00:36:41,117 --> 00:36:42,534
She thinks I have cancer!

635
00:36:42,535 --> 00:36:45,078
- So?
- Well, Skye, I don't.

636
00:36:45,079 --> 00:36:46,204
I know.

637
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:47,831
What?

638
00:36:47,832 --> 00:36:49,583
I overheard you
talking with Dan.

639
00:36:49,584 --> 00:36:51,293
And you didn't say anything?

640
00:36:51,294 --> 00:36:53,003
You're the one pretending
to have cancer.

641
00:36:53,004 --> 00:36:55,589
- Oh, no, no, I never said...
- Anything?

642
00:36:55,590 --> 00:36:58,216
- I tried to tell you.
- Right.

643
00:36:58,217 --> 00:37:01,387
Congrats, it must be real nice
having a clean bill of health.

644
00:37:03,472 --> 00:37:05,056
Where are you going?

645
00:37:05,057 --> 00:37:07,434
- Home.
- No.

646
00:37:07,435 --> 00:37:10,020
No, Skye, you're the one
who came to me.

647
00:37:10,021 --> 00:37:12,022
- My bad.
- No, I wanna know why.

648
00:37:12,023 --> 00:37:13,732
- Just leave me alone.
- Tell me why.

649
00:37:13,733 --> 00:37:16,151
Because it's on the list, OK?

650
00:37:16,152 --> 00:37:17,736
Where?

651
00:37:17,737 --> 00:37:20,113
What?

652
00:37:20,114 --> 00:37:21,448
"Punch someone
in the face"?

653
00:37:21,449 --> 00:37:23,825
No, help a sad case.

654
00:37:23,826 --> 00:37:27,204
Wow. Thanks.

655
00:37:27,205 --> 00:37:31,499
Before I got sick, I was just
waiting for my life to start.

656
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:33,168
Turns out,
life doesn't work that way.

657
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:35,337
I thought maybe I could
help you see that.

658
00:37:35,338 --> 00:37:37,047
I didn't ask
for your help.

659
00:37:37,048 --> 00:37:40,175
Friends don't wait
to be asked.

660
00:37:40,176 --> 00:37:42,469
You know,
I actually liked you.

661
00:37:42,470 --> 00:37:45,222
I mean, sure,
you're hung up and weird,

662
00:37:45,223 --> 00:37:48,099
and if I had a single other
friend in the entire world,

663
00:37:48,100 --> 00:37:51,019
I'd probably have
nothing to do with you.

664
00:37:51,020 --> 00:37:53,730
But as messed up as that is,
I liked you.

665
00:37:53,731 --> 00:37:55,733
I thought
you liked me too.

666
00:37:57,443 --> 00:38:00,111
Skye, I d... I do!

667
00:38:00,112 --> 00:38:03,032
- I want to be your friend.
- Why?

668
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:06,618
Because...

669
00:38:06,619 --> 00:38:08,745
you terrify me

670
00:38:08,746 --> 00:38:12,165
and... you excite me

671
00:38:12,166 --> 00:38:14,126
and when you're not around...

672
00:38:15,253 --> 00:38:16,754
I miss you.

673
00:38:19,257 --> 00:38:20,757
You really miss me?

674
00:38:20,758 --> 00:38:23,219
Yes, I do.

675
00:38:26,681 --> 00:38:28,640
Like, how much?
Like, on a scale of one to 10?

676
00:38:28,641 --> 00:38:31,519
Oh, my God, Skye. Stop.

677
00:38:34,105 --> 00:38:35,731
You're not gonna try
and kiss me now, are you?

678
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:43,322
Are you really gonna
punch someone in the face?

679
00:38:43,990 --> 00:38:45,199
Ooh!

680
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:50,912
[Calvin]
<i>Are you sure we're allowed to be</i>

681
00:38:50,913 --> 00:38:51,997
<i>in here this late?</i>

682
00:38:51,998 --> 00:38:53,832
Before state,
coach gave us key cards

683
00:38:53,833 --> 00:38:56,668
so as we could train here
whenever we liked.

684
00:38:56,669 --> 00:39:00,006
You can change in...
there.

685
00:39:01,507 --> 00:39:02,966
It's fine,
don't worry about it.

686
00:39:02,967 --> 00:39:04,801
Then why
are we whispering?

687
00:39:04,802 --> 00:39:06,886
I don't make the rules.

688
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:08,471
You make all the rules.

689
00:39:08,472 --> 00:39:09,974
[Skye whispers] I heard that.

690
00:39:11,267 --> 00:39:13,311
[Skye retching]

691
00:39:21,277 --> 00:39:23,570
[toilet flushing]

692
00:39:23,571 --> 00:39:25,906
[breathing heavily]

693
00:39:59,357 --> 00:40:00,899
You jumped off of that?

694
00:40:00,900 --> 00:40:03,401
I didn't jump, Calvin.

695
00:40:03,402 --> 00:40:06,155
It's not called
"state jumping championship".

696
00:40:07,782 --> 00:40:09,533

What do you even see
in this guy?

876
00:52:26,394 --> 00:52:28,813
Are you jealous?

877
00:52:28,814 --> 00:52:31,899
No.

878
00:52:31,900 --> 00:52:34,193
Oh, my God,
you're totally jealous.

879
00:52:34,194 --> 00:52:36,946
I'm not jealous.

880
00:52:36,947 --> 00:52:39,198
- Come here, just a little bit.
- Yeah.

881
00:52:39,199 --> 00:52:40,491
Skye Aitken, you know her?

882
00:52:40,492 --> 00:52:42,535
Skye Aitken, like,
look at like eight o'clock.

883
00:52:42,536 --> 00:52:44,203
- Eight o'clock.
- Over there.

884
00:52:44,204 --> 00:52:45,830
- Da-da-da-da-da!
- Just the eyes, keep the face.

885
00:52:45,831 --> 00:52:48,207
There you go.

886
00:52:48,208 --> 00:52:50,668
Listen, she's...

887
00:52:50,669 --> 00:52:52,753
I mean, you know
her situation, right?

888
00:52:52,754 --> 00:52:53,712
Guys...

889
00:52:53,713 --> 00:52:56,298
It would be amazing
if you could

890
00:52:56,299 --> 00:52:58,134
give us your phone number.

891
00:52:58,135 --> 00:52:59,802
Is this for you
or is this for her?

892
00:52:59,803 --> 00:53:01,178
It's for her,
just write it down.

893
00:53:01,179 --> 00:53:05,141
You know, sir, stop resisting.

894
00:53:05,142 --> 00:53:06,392
- Come on.
- Thank you so much.

895
00:53:06,393 --> 00:53:08,435
I really, really
appreciate this.

896
00:53:08,436 --> 00:53:12,023
Seriously, I will have you
and your whole family arrested.

897
00:53:13,316 --> 00:53:16,110
All right.
You absolutely suck!

898
00:53:16,111 --> 00:53:19,989
- Thank you very much.
- Are you serious?

899
00:53:19,990 --> 00:53:21,365
Hey, do you want us to run

900
00:53:21,366 --> 00:53:23,200
a background check on him,
sweetie?

901
00:53:23,201 --> 00:53:25,829
No, I'm sure his number
will be just fine.

902
00:53:30,125 --> 00:53:32,335
- [Skye laughs]
- [Calvin] What?

903
00:53:33,837 --> 00:53:36,380
- What's so funny?
- [Skye] Nothing.

904
00:53:36,381 --> 00:53:39,050
Skye, what's so funny?

905
00:53:40,218 --> 00:53:42,429
[Izzy] She packs a mean punch.

906
00:53:43,388 --> 00:53:44,346
Does it hurt?

907
00:53:44,347 --> 00:53:46,807
Uh, kinda, yeah.

908
00:53:46,808 --> 00:53:48,142
Oh.

909
00:53:48,143 --> 00:53:49,561
Here.

910
00:53:56,568 --> 00:53:57,444
Is that better?

911
00:53:58,612 --> 00:54:00,487
No, it hurts like hell.

912
00:54:00,488 --> 00:54:01,739
[both laugh]

913
00:54:01,740 --> 00:54:03,490
I still can't get over the fact

914
00:54:03,491 --> 00:54:07,328
that you work at an airport
but you're afraid of flying.

915
00:54:07,329 --> 00:54:10,372
Well, we have some
very important work

916
00:54:10,373 --> 00:54:11,874
down on the ground.

917
00:54:11,875 --> 00:54:14,418
Bet you've never
unloaded the cargo hold.

918
00:54:14,419 --> 00:54:16,921
Only because the unions
won't allow it.

919
00:54:16,922 --> 00:54:19,716
Otherwise, I'd be
all up on those bags.

920
00:54:22,886 --> 00:54:26,347
I was sick of him lying to me,
so I dumped him.

921
00:54:26,348 --> 00:54:30,643
And then this job came up,
and thought "What the hell?"

922
00:54:30,644 --> 00:54:32,728
Change of scenery
can't be all that bad.

923
00:54:32,729 --> 00:54:36,190
Get away from the ex,
get to see the world.

924
00:54:36,191 --> 00:54:38,984
Sounds like a win-win for me.
What about you?

925
00:54:38,985 --> 00:54:41,654
Do you think
you'll ever go back to school?

926
00:54:41,655 --> 00:54:43,322
I don't know.

927
00:54:43,323 --> 00:54:46,284
Did you drop out because of...

928
00:54:48,495 --> 00:54:50,579
Sorry, I shouldn't have asked.

929
00:54:50,580 --> 00:54:53,041
No, no, look.

930
00:54:54,417 --> 00:54:55,877
I...

931
00:54:57,003 --> 00:54:58,421
Yeah?

932
00:55:00,465 --> 00:55:02,759
I made you something.

933
00:55:12,435 --> 00:55:14,396
Oh, wow.

934
00:55:15,313 --> 00:55:16,939
Thank you.

935
00:55:16,940 --> 00:55:19,024
What is it?

936
00:55:19,025 --> 00:55:21,819
It's the sacred Ibis bird.

937
00:55:21,820 --> 00:55:23,487
The sacred what now?

938
00:55:23,488 --> 00:55:26,448
[chuckles]
Sacred Ibis bird.

939
00:55:26,449 --> 00:55:30,244
In ancient Egypt,
it represented the god Thoth.

940
00:55:30,245 --> 00:55:33,080
When you die, Thoth would
question you on your life

941
00:55:33,081 --> 00:55:35,124
and, if the scales
were balanced,

942
00:55:35,125 --> 00:55:38,003
he'd say your heart
was just and true.

943
00:55:40,130 --> 00:55:42,339
I love it.

944
00:55:42,340 --> 00:55:44,968
No one's ever made
anything for me before.

945
00:55:47,470 --> 00:55:48,555
Thank you.

946
00:55:53,977 --> 00:55:56,980
I think Thoth would say a lot
of good things about you.

947
00:56:07,782 --> 00:56:09,283
Is that all you got?

948
00:56:09,284 --> 00:56:12,037

Great.

959
00:56:54,037 --> 00:56:56,081
You didn't tell your parents
I punched you, did you?

960
00:56:58,416 --> 00:56:59,501
Did you?

961
00:57:00,752 --> 00:57:01,961
Did you?!

00:57:03,630 --> 00:57:05,255
[indistinct chatter]

963
00:57:05,256 --> 00:57:07,549
[Lucy] I can't get over
the change in Calvin.

964
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:10,427
What's your secret?
Maybe I can try it on Frank.

[both laugh]

966
00:57:15,350 --> 00:57:16,975
[Skye] Calvin's mom OK?

967
00:57:16,976 --> 00:57:18,853
He didn't tell you?

968
00:57:20,814 --> 00:57:22,315
Of course not.

969
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:25,610
He had a sister who died.

970
00:57:27,070 --> 00:57:30,532
After that, she just shut down.

971
00:57:31,491 --> 00:57:32,826
That's so sad.

972
00:57:34,702 --> 00:57:37,038
I hope my parents
will be able to cope.

973
00:57:48,258 --> 00:57:50,050
The way I see it,

974
00:57:50,051 --> 00:57:51,886
you have two options.

975
00:57:53,012 --> 00:57:54,805
You either get cancer

976
00:57:54,806 --> 00:57:57,224
or you never, ever
tell her the truth.

977
00:57:57,225 --> 00:57:59,059
I can't keep lying to her.

978
00:57:59,060 --> 00:58:03,814
I don't know, Calvin. I mean,
I like you for who you are,

979
00:58:03,815 --> 00:58:07,109
but what if Izzy only really
likes you for your cancer?

980
00:58:07,110 --> 00:58:09,028
[laughs] OK.

981
00:58:09,237 --> 00:58:12,198
- People really get off on that shit.
- OK, moving on.

982
00:58:13,491 --> 00:58:16,285
What's next on your list, eh?

983
00:58:16,286 --> 00:58:18,495
What adventure
you gonna take me on?

984
00:58:18,496 --> 00:58:21,498
So there's this one thing,

985
00:58:21,499 --> 00:58:23,500
but it's kind of embarrassing.

986
00:58:23,501 --> 00:58:24,751
I don't think you could say

987
00:58:24,752 --> 00:58:26,337
anything to surprise me anymore,
Skye.

988
00:58:28,339 --> 00:58:30,175
I've never made love.

989
00:58:33,636 --> 00:58:38,474
- [laughs] Your face!
- Funny.

990
00:58:38,475 --> 00:58:40,017
So what do you say?

991
00:58:40,018 --> 00:58:41,769
Your place or mine?

992
00:58:44,439 --> 00:58:45,856
Skye...

993
00:58:45,857 --> 00:58:48,485
I hate to break it to you...

994
00:58:49,444 --> 00:58:50,653
but you can't wink.

995
00:58:51,905 --> 00:58:54,239
- Yes, I can.
- You cannot wink.

996
00:58:54,240 --> 00:58:57,409
This wink you're doing with
your tongue and your eyes,

997
00:58:57,410 --> 00:58:58,577
it's not a wink.

998
00:58:58,578 --> 00:59:01,663
Like, your tongue comes out,
your eyes droop.

999
00:59:01,664 --> 00:59:02,831
It's unnecessary.

1000
00:59:02,832 --> 00:59:05,210
It's like... [babbling]

1001
00:59:08,463 --> 00:59:09,881
You OK?

1002
00:59:11,508 --> 00:59:12,717
[Calvin] You don't need
to involve the...

1003
00:59:16,763 --> 00:59:18,472
This better not be
a sex dungeon.

1004
00:59:18,473 --> 00:59:20,849
That is in the basement.

1005
00:59:20,850 --> 00:59:23,519
Calvin Lewis,
as I live and breathe,

1006
00:59:23,520 --> 00:59:25,980
I think you just made a joke.

1007
00:59:28,316 --> 00:59:29,150
What do you think?

1008
00:59:31,778 --> 00:59:33,612
It's a nice crib.

1009
00:59:33,613 --> 00:59:36,073
It's for Frank and Lucy's baby.

1010
00:59:36,074 --> 00:59:38,368
I'm almost finished.

1011
00:59:39,953 --> 00:59:41,328
Wait.

1012
00:59:41,329 --> 00:59:42,705
You made this?

1013
00:59:44,040 --> 00:59:46,667
Calvin, it's beautiful.

1014
00:59:46,668 --> 00:59:48,418
Wait, you made this?

1015
00:59:48,419 --> 00:59:52,881
Well, my dad kinda got me
into this when I was a kid.

1016
00:59:52,882 --> 00:59:55,552
Helps me take my mind
off things, you know?

1017
00:59:57,804 --> 00:59:59,138
I love it.

1018
01:00:02,642 --> 01:00:04,394
How about that sex dungeon?

1019
01:00:19,242 --> 01:00:21,493
Are you sure it's OK
for me to sleep here?

1020
01:00:21,494 --> 01:00:23,787
[Calvin] As long as
you're not afraid of heights.

1022
01:01:06,164 --> 01:01:08,541
[whispers] Calvin,
are you awake?

1023
01:01:12,295 --> 01:01:13,671
Maybe.

1024
01:02:16,984 --> 01:02:18,694
- This way, this way.
- Over here?

1025
01:02:18,695 --> 01:02:20,987
- Yes, right.
- God, where are you taking me?

1026
01:02:20,988 --> 01:02:23,031
You'll see.
It's just a bit further.

1027
01:02:23,032 --> 01:02:24,282
Yeah, we've got this.

1028
01:02:24,283 --> 01:02:26,284
[Calvin] Ooh,
there's a weird echo.

1029
01:02:26,285 --> 01:02:29,079
- Wait, where are we?
- [Izzy] You'll see. Be patient.

1030
01:02:29,080 --> 01:02:31,206
All will be revealed.

1031
01:02:31,207 --> 01:02:35,085
- Oh, no peeking!
- OK, OK.

1032
01:02:35,086 --> 01:02:36,421
Watch your step.

1033
01:02:39,632 --> 01:02:41,634
OK. You can open your eyes now.

1034
01:02:43,678 --> 01:02:45,555
May I have your boarding pass?

1035
01:02:52,729 --> 01:02:54,104
Straight ahead on your right.

1036

will be with you shortly.

in this plane,

the Mile High club.

It's a pleasure
to have you with us.

Sir, if you could please
return your seat

1047
01:03:28,765 --> 01:03:30,515
to its upright position.

1048
01:03:30,516 --> 01:03:33,769
To fasten your seatbelt,
place that metal tip

1049
01:03:33,770 --> 01:03:38,356
into the buckle
and tighten the strap.

1050
01:03:38,357 --> 01:03:40,442
If the cabin
