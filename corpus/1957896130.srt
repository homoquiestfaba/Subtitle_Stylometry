1
00:00:18,723 --> 00:00:20,523
- Morning, Bill.
- Good morning, sir.

2
00:00:22,323 --> 00:00:25,003
- How you doing?
- Doing well, sir. Thank you.

3
00:00:25,083 --> 00:00:26,483
Yourself? Sleep well?

4
00:00:26,563 --> 00:00:28,443
- Uh, not so well.
- No.

5
00:00:28,523 --> 00:00:30,203
No?

6
00:00:31,163 --> 00:00:35,243
Today is the last day
of shooting after six months.

7
00:00:36,003 --> 00:00:39,443
We are actually really shooting
the last scene of season one.

8
00:00:39,523 --> 00:00:41,323
Um, that was always planned.

9
00:00:42,203 --> 00:00:44,723
I like emotional
endings of shootings.

10
00:00:46,523 --> 00:00:48,243
It was really a
beautiful journey.

11
00:00:48,323 --> 00:00:50,483
Let's roll
the camera, please.

12
00:00:56,123 --> 00:00:57,323
And action!

13
00:00:59,563 --> 00:01:00,563
Let her go!

14
00:01:09,523 --> 00:01:10,803
Stop!

15
00:01:11,883 --> 00:01:13,203
No!

16
00:01:18,683 --> 00:01:20,683
Hi. My name is Jantje.

17
00:01:20,763 --> 00:01:24,443
I'm the showrunner and
head writer, um, of Dark.

18
00:01:24,523 --> 00:01:25,923
Of Dark.

19
00:01:27,403 --> 00:01:28,923
Bo and Jantje, take one.

20
00:01:29,003 --> 00:01:30,683
Uh, hi.
I'm Baran bo Odar.

21
00:01:30,763 --> 00:01:34,643
I'm the showrunner, director,
and executive producer of 1899.

22
00:01:37,523 --> 00:01:42,203
It's about a ship of
immigrants going from Europe to America.

23
00:01:42,283 --> 00:01:46,003
And on their journey, they
encounter something very mysterious.

24
00:01:54,763 --> 00:01:58,363
But we can talk spoiler now,
no? I guess, yeah. So it's…

25
00:01:58,883 --> 00:02:01,323
The whole show starts
as a period drama

26
00:02:01,403 --> 00:02:04,523
slash turning into some
kind of a horror show.

27
00:02:04,603 --> 00:02:06,603
But then it turns
into a sci-fi show

28
00:02:06,683 --> 00:02:10,083
because what we will reveal is that
they are stuck in a simulation.

29
00:02:10,163 --> 00:02:12,243
And what they will
have to find out is,

30
00:02:12,323 --> 00:02:14,283
first, who put them
in the simulation.

31
00:02:14,363 --> 00:02:17,763
And then, the bigger question, how
do they get out of the simulation?

32
00:02:19,803 --> 00:02:22,363
Ultimately,
it's about our existence.

33
00:02:22,443 --> 00:02:25,163
Why we're here on this planet

34
00:02:25,243 --> 00:02:27,483
and who we are and
who created us.

35
00:02:28,083 --> 00:02:29,003
Um…

36
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:32,763
- Very deep, deep, meaningful questions.
- It's all good.

37
00:02:34,163 --> 00:02:36,283
Everything is connected.

38
00:02:36,963 --> 00:02:38,203
Future,

39
00:02:38,803 --> 00:02:39,843
past,

40
00:02:40,483 --> 00:02:41,883
and present.

41
00:02:44,563 --> 00:02:47,563
We said to Bo and Jantje,
"Your cast in Dark was so amazing."

42
00:02:47,643 --> 00:02:49,203
"Who can come from Dark?"

43
00:02:50,163 --> 00:02:52,123
Even while we were
still shooting Dark,

44
00:02:52,203 --> 00:02:56,083
I knew that they were going to
do a new series, a big series.

45
00:02:56,643 --> 00:03:00,003
They really wanted to be surrounded
by new talents, by new people.

46
00:03:00,083 --> 00:03:03,923
They wanted, you know, just to
get new ideas and new impulses.

47
00:03:04,003 --> 00:03:06,803
And I knew that it was going
to be an international cast,

48
00:03:06,883 --> 00:03:09,283
so I didn't expect at all
to be involved in that.

49
00:03:09,803 --> 00:03:13,843
Eventually I received a
call from Bo telling me,

50
00:03:13,923 --> 00:03:16,403
"Listen, you know, we
always wanted to… to get

51
00:03:16,483 --> 00:03:20,603
some distance between the work on Dark
and now the new project and everything."

52
00:03:20,683 --> 00:03:24,963
"But actually, when we consider
it, there's enough distance now."

53
00:03:25,043 --> 00:03:27,043
"There's a part in that
show, the captain."

54
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:30,123
"And we just think you're
most apt to do it."

55
00:03:34,443 --> 00:03:36,403
That was a very
happy day for me.

56
00:03:42,443 --> 00:03:47,403
Six hours ago, we received a message,
coordinates southwest of our course.

57
00:03:48,803 --> 00:03:51,123
We believe this message
comes from the Prometheus.

58
00:03:52,803 --> 00:03:54,443
The
character of the captain,

59
00:03:54,483 --> 00:03:59,563
he was described as being a
sort of soulful, world-weary,

60
00:03:59,643 --> 00:04:03,083
kind of weathered but also
very handsome character.

61
00:04:03,163 --> 00:04:06,523
Andreas was someone that sort
of fits that brief perfectly.

62
00:04:06,603 --> 00:04:11,003
I think there's a kind of through
line of his character from Dark.

63
00:04:16,603 --> 00:04:18,699
In Dark, I had
to understand most of it,

64
00:04:18,723 --> 00:04:20,523
because I was the
traveler from the future,

65
00:04:20,603 --> 00:04:22,203
from the past, and
from everywhere.

66
00:04:22,283 --> 00:04:24,843
So I knew what was going on
and was trying to prevent it.

67
00:04:24,923 --> 00:04:31,003
Now, I'm more or less the one
experiencing those weird happenings

68
00:04:31,083 --> 00:04:32,443
and not understanding them.

69
00:04:32,523 --> 00:04:37,403
So I'm now on the voyage to understand
and to find out together with Maura.

70
00:04:42,563 --> 00:04:45,283
I think the story is like a
labyrinth, as Maura's mind

71
00:04:45,363 --> 00:04:47,323
and Maura's obsession
with neurology

72
00:04:47,403 --> 00:04:50,123
and connections in the brain.

73
00:04:51,323 --> 00:04:53,843
It probably has been the
most challenging character

74
00:04:53,923 --> 00:04:56,083
that I have ever played
and will ever play.

75
00:04:56,163 --> 00:04:57,803
I am Maura Franklin.

76
00:04:59,723 --> 00:05:01,723
I'm not crazy!

77
00:05:03,963 --> 00:05:06,443
I… I know what I've
seen. I'm not crazy!

78
00:05:09,163 --> 00:05:10,883
Emily's
character, Maura,

79
00:05:10,963 --> 00:05:13,483
seemed to be an
unconventional hero

80
00:05:13,563 --> 00:05:17,123
from the way that Bo and Jantje
described her as a character.

81
00:05:19,563 --> 00:05:23,643
Emily has shown in her huge
range of work up until now

82
00:05:23,723 --> 00:05:27,723
that she had all of those facets of
being slightly mysterious, unknowable,

83
00:05:28,403 --> 00:05:30,323
incredibly strong, dynamic.

84
00:05:30,403 --> 00:05:32,083
She nailed her audition.

85
00:05:32,683 --> 00:05:34,163
Eyk. Eyk Larsen.

86
00:05:40,723 --> 00:05:42,323
Maura Franklin.

87
00:05:47,283 --> 00:05:48,283
You're the captain.

88
00:05:51,483 --> 00:05:53,363
When Maura
first meets Eyk,

89
00:05:53,443 --> 00:05:58,283
she sees a certain
likeness to herself

90
00:05:58,363 --> 00:06:01,643
and… a vulnerability.

91
00:06:02,683 --> 00:06:08,363
Maura is a woman that is so different
from everyone he met before.

92
00:06:08,883 --> 00:06:11,283
It's not falling in
love at first glance,

93
00:06:11,363 --> 00:06:14,243
but he can sense
that this is a woman

94
00:06:14,323 --> 00:06:17,883
that is really different from
all the other women around him.

95
00:06:17,963 --> 00:06:21,643
They can feel, without telling,
that they have a similar problem.

96
00:06:25,923 --> 00:06:28,443
Why do you take such an
interest in the Prometheus?

97
00:06:30,763 --> 00:06:32,283
Did you know anyone on board?

98
00:06:37,283 --> 00:06:39,723
Normally we
would cast actors,

99
00:06:39,803 --> 00:06:42,403
auditioning them in
real time in this room.

100
00:06:42,483 --> 00:06:45,323
On 1899, we couldn't do that
'cause we were mid-pandemic,

101
00:06:45,403 --> 00:06:46,523
so we did it on Zoom.

102
00:06:48,003 --> 00:06:50,043
It was an opportunity
to reach out at a moment

103
00:06:50,123 --> 00:06:52,403
when the world was
really closing down.

104
00:06:56,003 --> 00:07:00,563
Bo and Jantje wanted to
have this truly international cast,

105
00:07:00,643 --> 00:07:03,443
and they wanted everyone
speaking their own language.

106
00:07:04,523 --> 00:07:09,603
We ended up casting out
of England, Germany,

107
00:07:09,683 --> 00:07:12,163
Norway, Iceland, France,

108
00:07:12,763 --> 00:07:13,883
Hong Kong…

109
00:07:15,363 --> 00:07:17,683
Spain, Poland, Portugal…

110
00:07:19,483 --> 00:07:20,803
Did you say Denmark?

111
00:07:21,923 --> 00:07:25,323
That was a truly
huge challenge for us,

112
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,163
and I think a really
groundbreaking idea from them.

113
00:07:29,563 --> 00:07:31,283
Ah, waiter.

114
00:07:32,643 --> 00:07:33,643
More.

115
00:07:34,563 --> 00:07:36,123
Don't you think
you've had enough?

116
00:07:36,203 --> 00:07:38,083
The problem is you're
a fucking bore.

117
00:07:38,163 --> 00:07:39,803
Ángel, lower your voice, please.

118
00:07:39,883 --> 00:07:42,003
"Ángel, lower your voice,
please. Calm down."

119
00:07:42,083 --> 00:07:46,323
None of these fuckers understands
a word I'm saying. Why should I?

120
00:07:47,763 --> 00:07:50,683
1899 is really
a complicated construct

121
00:07:50,763 --> 00:07:54,003
in terms of how to deal
with different languages.

122
00:07:54,083 --> 00:07:57,563
We have a crew from all
kinds of different countries,

123
00:07:57,643 --> 00:08:00,443
but our main cast is also
from all different countries,

124
00:08:00,523 --> 00:08:02,563
and so are the
characters in the show.

125
00:08:04,203 --> 00:08:08,723
I am Isabella Wei. My
character's name in 1899 is Ling Yi.

126
00:08:09,603 --> 00:08:11,123
The
people on the ship,

127
00:08:11,203 --> 00:08:13,603
they think that Ling
Yi is a Japanese geisha

128
00:08:13,683 --> 00:08:15,923
who is traveling
with her servant.

129
00:08:16,003 --> 00:08:19,643
In reality, she is a very
poor girl from Hong Kong.

130
00:08:20,323 --> 00:08:22,523
What would you
need that many knives for?

131
00:08:23,363 --> 00:08:24,443
I don't know.

132
00:08:26,083 --> 00:08:27,923
Try and pretend you know.

133
00:08:31,043 --> 00:08:33,363
We'd like
to add, "Just eat it."

134
00:08:33,443 --> 00:08:37,563
And so, I think you're picking
the knife and the fork.

135
00:08:37,643 --> 00:08:41,603
Maybe you share one more look, and
then you say, like, "Just eat it."

136
00:08:41,683 --> 00:08:43,003
- Okay.
- Yeah, okay.

137
00:08:43,083 --> 00:08:45,563
A certain… Do you know…?

138
00:08:45,643 --> 00:08:47,243
- That how you say it?
- Yeah.

139
00:08:47,283 --> 00:08:50,283
- Okay.
- Is that with "just," or is that "eat it"?

140
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:53,923
There are days where I have to
listen to Cantonese the whole day,

141
00:08:54,003 --> 00:08:57,963
and I have no clue what they're saying,
but I can tell what they're saying

142
00:08:58,043 --> 00:09:00,083
by rehearsing a lot

143
00:09:00,163 --> 00:09:02,243
and trusting the actors
that they tell me,

144
00:09:02,323 --> 00:09:05,403
"This is the angry version of
'I love you' in Cantonese,"

145
00:09:05,483 --> 00:09:08,723
as almost everything in Cantonese
sounds, to us, very angry.

146
00:09:09,243 --> 00:09:12,043
We had to come
up with a lot of systems

147
00:09:12,123 --> 00:09:14,803
for us to understand
what everyone is saying.

148
00:09:14,883 --> 00:09:17,843
Um, is this in character?
Is this not in character?

149
00:09:17,923 --> 00:09:20,403
And let's roll sound.

150
00:09:20,483 --> 00:09:22,723
You used me
to get what you wanted.

151
00:09:23,683 --> 00:09:27,803
Cantonese, Spanish,
Danish, Polish, German, French.

152
00:09:28,483 --> 00:09:31,363
We all have language
assistants with us on set

153
00:09:31,963 --> 00:09:37,283
who kind of help us if we have missed
a line or have said something wrong.

154
00:09:47,163 --> 00:09:49,123
My name is
Lucas Lynggaard Tønnesen.

155
00:09:49,203 --> 00:09:53,723
I play Krester in the
new Netflix series 1899.

156
00:09:54,323 --> 00:09:57,843
Everyone, from the start!

157
00:09:57,923 --> 00:09:59,459
The first
scene we see Krester in,

158
00:09:59,483 --> 00:10:02,563
it was actually one of the
scenes I was most worried about.

159
00:10:04,883 --> 00:10:08,443
The dining room is full of
these high-profile individuals,

160
00:10:08,523 --> 00:10:11,723
and this guy suddenly appears
who looks like a freak,

161
00:10:12,723 --> 00:10:16,603
asking something on a language
they don't understand.

162
00:10:17,843 --> 00:10:20,083
Excuse
me. Excuse me.

163
00:10:25,563 --> 00:10:26,483
Excuse me.

164
00:10:26,563 --> 00:10:29,283
We need help.

165
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:32,843
You embrace the fact that
you don't understand one another.

166
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:35,723
You don't have to spend the scene
going, "I don't understand you."

167
00:10:35,803 --> 00:10:39,043
It's just in the scene, and you
just have to get on with it.

168
00:10:39,963 --> 00:10:43,843
Much like you would in real life, if
you were found in these situations.

169
00:10:43,923 --> 00:10:46,843
You just have to
just… run with it.

170
00:10:51,003 --> 00:10:53,043
We need a
doctor! Let go of me!

171
00:10:53,123 --> 00:10:55,963
The weird part,
it's speaking your language

172
00:10:56,043 --> 00:10:58,763
to someone that you know
is not understanding you.

173
00:10:59,283 --> 00:11:02,043
I have a love interest
in the show, Krester,

174
00:11:02,123 --> 00:11:05,643
with whom I communicate a
lot… in very special ways.

175
00:11:06,363 --> 00:11:08,883
But not with words,
just with the eyes,

176
00:11:08,963 --> 00:11:10,443
with the body language.

177
00:11:10,523 --> 00:11:12,803
And I think that
makes it very special.

178
00:11:12,883 --> 00:11:14,323
A lot more special than

179
00:11:14,963 --> 00:11:16,803
what it would be if
I could just say it.

180
00:11:21,083 --> 00:11:23,843
'Cause of his eyes,
he can tell that

181
00:11:24,603 --> 00:11:27,123
Krester has a similar
past as he has.

182
00:11:27,723 --> 00:11:29,843
They understand each
other very well.

183
00:11:29,923 --> 00:11:31,923
They understand troubles
they've gone through

184
00:11:32,003 --> 00:11:35,443
because they're both gay in a
time where you can't be gay.

185
00:11:38,723 --> 00:11:42,963
It's absolutely amazing to
have all these nationalities combined.

186
00:11:43,043 --> 00:11:44,843
We can communicate
in sort of a way.

187
00:11:44,923 --> 00:11:48,403
It really depends on how we see
through the language barrier.

188
00:11:49,763 --> 00:11:51,003
Ladies and gentlemen…

189
00:11:52,363 --> 00:11:54,163
Ladies and gent… Oh, is it?

190
00:11:54,243 --> 00:11:55,683
- He's trying to…?
- Come here.

191
00:11:55,763 --> 00:11:59,403
Ladies and gentlemen,
welcome to… Word.

192
00:11:59,483 --> 00:12:02,643
What does "bangers
and mash" mean?

193
00:12:02,723 --> 00:12:04,443
- Bangers?
- Bangers?

194
00:12:04,523 --> 00:12:06,083
"Bangers and mash."

195
00:12:07,643 --> 00:12:09,643
Sorry.

196
00:12:13,363 --> 00:12:14,243
Oh, God.

197
00:12:18,163 --> 00:12:20,843
There's a lot of people from
different countries working.

198
00:12:20,923 --> 00:12:21,803
That's really cool.

199
00:12:25,043 --> 00:12:26,563
I feel like it's "custard."

200
00:12:26,643 --> 00:12:27,523
No, it's not.

201
00:12:36,723 --> 00:12:37,843
I agree.

202
00:12:37,923 --> 00:12:41,883
My name's Maciej
Musiał, and I play Olek in 1899.

203
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:44,083
It's fine.

204
00:12:47,643 --> 00:12:49,603
Olek
finds Ling Yi on the deck

205
00:12:49,683 --> 00:12:53,003
when she's trying to
hide from her mother.

206
00:12:53,083 --> 00:12:54,763
And he's like, "Oh,
come. I can hide you."

207
00:12:54,803 --> 00:12:56,003
Are you cold?

208
00:12:57,123 --> 00:13:00,483
It's a beautiful scene
'cause we don't understand each other.

209
00:13:00,563 --> 00:13:03,603
She speaks Cantonese,
and I speak Polish.

210
00:13:03,683 --> 00:13:07,243
Just by our intentions,
we understand each other.

211
00:13:07,323 --> 00:13:09,483
Dirty. But warm.

212
00:13:09,563 --> 00:13:12,443
I believe that in
languages, you have seeds of cultures,

213
00:13:12,523 --> 00:13:14,843
of feelings, of… of
different countries,

214
00:13:14,923 --> 00:13:17,003
and in order to,
like, meet them,

215
00:13:17,083 --> 00:13:19,923
you have to be brave
enough to listen to them.

216
00:13:20,803 --> 00:13:22,843
I think this show gives
you the opportunity.

217
00:13:22,923 --> 00:13:26,603
It feels like you're… you're
traveling to all those places.

218
00:13:27,123 --> 00:13:30,683
I've got something to send
you Josefine sent me from Denmark.

219
00:13:30,763 --> 00:13:32,003
There's no quarantine there

220
00:13:32,083 --> 00:13:34,843
so it looks like we might
be able to go to Denmark…

221
00:13:34,923 --> 00:13:37,963
The first issue we
were facing was the pandemic

222
00:13:38,043 --> 00:13:40,083
that happened that, yeah,

223
00:13:40,163 --> 00:13:42,603
turned this world upside down.

224
00:13:42,683 --> 00:13:44,883
We wanted to make
a European show

225
00:13:44,963 --> 00:13:47,483
with a European cast
and a European crew.

226
00:13:47,563 --> 00:13:50,403
Wanted, actually, also to
travel to all these places

227
00:13:50,483 --> 00:13:53,003
where we wanted to
shoot and just realized,

228
00:13:53,083 --> 00:13:54,643
"Wait, we can't
do that anymore."

229
00:13:54,723 --> 00:13:56,603
We have to
get special dispensation…

230
00:13:56,683 --> 00:14:00,363
Every production is always a
headache. It's always a crazy puzzle.

231
00:14:00,963 --> 00:14:02,803
But in COVID, it's insane.

232
00:14:03,443 --> 00:14:06,923
You're not only dealing with people
who are going to be in other shows

233
00:14:07,003 --> 00:14:09,443
or traveling from countries.
They've got families.

234
00:14:09,523 --> 00:14:11,123
You're also dealing
with quarantine.

235
00:14:11,203 --> 00:14:13,619
Quarantine when they go home,
quarantine when they come to us.

236
00:14:13,643 --> 00:14:17,003
So if someone's coming two days,
you're taking them out for three weeks.

237
00:14:17,083 --> 00:14:20,483
That's when the Volume
started to be talked about.

238
00:14:25,323 --> 00:14:30,283
Me and Bo, I think we're both quite
strong in stressful situations.

239
00:14:30,803 --> 00:14:33,603
There are people who just
crumble under stress.

240
00:14:33,683 --> 00:14:37,763
And I think both… Bo
and I, we kind of… grow.

241
00:14:38,363 --> 00:14:41,803
Someone at Netflix told
us about the Volume technology.

242
00:14:41,883 --> 00:14:45,203
At the beginning, we didn't really
take it seriously, to be honest,

243
00:14:45,283 --> 00:14:47,843
because we are more the
very traditional filmmakers.

244
00:14:47,923 --> 00:14:50,923
Anything that can be done
in camera, we prefer.

245
00:14:51,003 --> 00:14:53,003
Like, we really
hate green screen.

246
00:14:54,123 --> 00:14:57,443
Venturing into something that's
completely new is very difficult,

247
00:14:57,523 --> 00:14:59,923
and it helps if the
people at the table

248
00:15:00,003 --> 00:15:02,803
understand what each and
every one is talking about.

249
00:15:03,323 --> 00:15:07,803
Some key figures for us were
definitely Udo Kramer and Nik Summerer.

250
00:15:07,883 --> 00:15:10,803
They already know what kind
of look we're aiming for,

251
00:15:10,883 --> 00:15:12,883
and we know that we can
communicate with them

252
00:15:12,963 --> 00:15:14,843
and that the
communication works.

253
00:15:17,163 --> 00:15:22,603
The Volume is an incredible
artistic tool to work with.

254
00:15:23,243 --> 00:15:27,003
But it also is quite a
beast in its own rights,

255
00:15:27,083 --> 00:15:28,923
and it can be really challenging

256
00:15:29,003 --> 00:15:33,403
to actually tame
this Volume animal.

257
00:15:34,483 --> 00:15:36,523
Every person
who reads about it

258
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:40,243
or watches some "making of"
always thinks it's a magic tool.

259
00:15:40,323 --> 00:15:43,323
You just push a button, you
choose any landscape you want.

260
00:15:43,403 --> 00:15:46,043
And in seconds you have it,
and you can do it right away.

261
00:15:46,123 --> 00:15:47,603
It's a lot of prep work.

262
00:15:47,683 --> 00:15:49,563
It is a lot of frustration.

263
00:15:49,643 --> 00:15:52,163
It is literally a new
way of filmmaking.

264
00:15:52,883 --> 00:15:54,443
Going into production,

265
00:15:54,523 --> 00:15:57,963
we didn't know whether this
was actually going to work.

266
00:16:00,003 --> 00:16:01,243
We did a lot of research,

267
00:16:01,323 --> 00:16:03,643
but there wasn't so much
research we could do.

268
00:16:03,723 --> 00:16:08,003
There was just basically one show
that used this technology before.

269
00:16:08,083 --> 00:16:10,603
We did the
test shoot in London.

270
00:16:10,683 --> 00:16:13,043
Really tested things that
we knew will not work

271
00:16:13,123 --> 00:16:15,403
to understand why
it's not working.

272
00:16:15,483 --> 00:16:19,483
Really harsh sunlight scenes
are still tricky to create

273
00:16:19,563 --> 00:16:22,043
because the sun is
such a hot source

274
00:16:22,123 --> 00:16:24,963
that it's really hard
to create on stage.

275
00:16:25,723 --> 00:16:28,003
But the stuff that
actually then worked…

276
00:16:28,083 --> 00:16:31,203
And that was, for example,
the evening atmosphere.

277
00:16:31,283 --> 00:16:34,283
We shot with a woman
standing there in the desert

278
00:16:34,363 --> 00:16:37,683
and had this really
beautiful reddish sunlight

279
00:16:37,763 --> 00:16:39,763
on her hair and skin tone.

280
00:16:39,843 --> 00:16:43,483
It was really mind-blowing
for us that it looked so real.

281
00:16:43,563 --> 00:16:45,283
We've looked at each
other, Nik and I.

282
00:16:45,363 --> 00:16:48,123
And we knew, "Okay, this is
definitely the way we're going."

283
00:16:50,403 --> 00:16:51,819
How would
you describe the Volume

284
00:16:51,843 --> 00:16:53,403
to somebody who knows
nothing about it?

285
00:16:53,443 --> 00:16:55,723
Well, I tried to describe it
to my son, and I just said…

286
00:16:59,563 --> 00:17:02,523
"It's like the biggest
TV you'll ever see,

287
00:17:02,603 --> 00:17:04,323
and we just act in front of it."

288
00:17:05,843 --> 00:17:12,243
The Volume is a massive, massive
cylindrical wall of LED lights.

289
00:17:12,323 --> 00:17:15,523
And it literally can take
you anywhere in the world.

290
00:17:16,283 --> 00:17:17,523
Mother!

291
00:17:18,803 --> 00:17:20,243
Don't go! Help!

292
00:17:22,563 --> 00:17:24,043
We call
it the Dark Bay.

293
00:17:24,963 --> 00:17:28,483
It's built in the oldest
building complex here on the lot.

294
00:17:28,563 --> 00:17:31,403
That's the Marlene-Dietrich
stage, built in 1910.

295
00:17:31,483 --> 00:17:33,963
Fritz Lang's Metropolis
was shot in there.

296
00:17:34,043 --> 00:17:37,163
They used, on these
stages, rear projection.

297
00:17:37,243 --> 00:17:40,403
The Volume itself is the
development of that technology.

298
00:17:40,483 --> 00:17:42,403
It's rear projection
brought into the future.

299
00:17:43,403 --> 00:17:46,283
We have 350 square
meter shooting area,

300
00:17:46,363 --> 00:17:49,243
270 degrees of viewing angles.

301
00:17:49,323 --> 00:17:52,003
And has an industry-first
revolving stage,

302
00:17:52,083 --> 00:17:54,483
which can basically
move the entire set

303
00:17:54,563 --> 00:17:57,523
and enable the filmmaker
to shoot 360 degrees

304
00:17:57,603 --> 00:17:59,923
in whatever environment
you could think of.

305
00:18:02,043 --> 00:18:04,659
We thought
we could bring this on a new level

306
00:18:04,683 --> 00:18:08,403
and try to not change
the set all over again,

307
00:18:08,483 --> 00:18:13,003
but change part of the set that
fits in like a pizza slice.

308
00:18:13,603 --> 00:18:15,683
Get this part, bring it in here.

309
00:18:16,243 --> 00:18:17,323
Whoops.

310
00:18:18,523 --> 00:18:20,403
Go back, shoot it.

311
00:18:20,483 --> 00:18:23,363
So now we have
a turnaround situation

312
00:18:23,443 --> 00:18:25,563
of just a few minutes.

313
00:18:28,163 --> 00:18:30,283
Actually, we have camera
assistants complaining

314
00:18:30,363 --> 00:18:32,483
that they have no time
to have a cigarette.

315
00:18:33,443 --> 00:18:35,163
Start the rain, please.

316
00:18:35,243 --> 00:18:39,203
The other great thing
that we have in here is a rain rig.

317
00:18:39,283 --> 00:18:43,683
And this is something where I
think nobody believed in but Bo

318
00:18:43,763 --> 00:18:45,363
that this is possible.

319
00:18:45,443 --> 00:18:48,203
And I'm not talking about drizzle,
I'm talking about proper rain,

320
00:18:48,283 --> 00:18:50,843
where we've been all standing,
and the actors have been standing,

321
00:18:50,923 --> 00:18:52,603
and we all got really wet.

322
00:18:52,683 --> 00:18:54,763
And it worked like a breeze.

323
00:18:54,843 --> 00:18:56,683
Nice. Come here, I'll help you.

324
00:18:58,043 --> 00:18:59,443
And this boot.

325
00:19:04,483 --> 00:19:08,683
Yay, here's my
flying sweetheart!

326
00:19:08,763 --> 00:19:11,803
It's okay. It's okay. I'm
fine. Thank you so much.

327
00:19:13,923 --> 00:19:14,923
Hallelujah.

328
00:19:21,643 --> 00:19:25,283
It's really hard to kill people.

329
00:19:25,363 --> 00:19:27,483
Hiya. I'm, uh, Fflyn Edwards,

330
00:19:27,563 --> 00:19:30,963
um, and I just did a stunt.

331
00:19:32,203 --> 00:19:34,003
Hey. Nice to meet you, guys.

332
00:19:34,083 --> 00:19:35,443
Introduce yourself.

333
00:19:35,523 --> 00:19:37,683
I'm Antje, the stunt
coordinator on this show.

334
00:19:37,763 --> 00:19:41,603
I'm really proud to be here,
and he did just an awesome job.

335
00:19:42,523 --> 00:19:44,323
I don't wanna do this anymore.

336
00:19:45,483 --> 00:19:48,643
That's why I… I rest.

337
00:19:48,723 --> 00:19:53,563
I already killed him multiple
times. You know, the boy. So, um…

338
00:19:56,003 --> 00:19:58,923
Yeah, I think they're
doing it up there again.

339
00:19:59,003 --> 00:20:00,443
Throw
the boy overboard!

340
00:20:02,163 --> 00:20:03,163
Stop!

341
00:20:03,683 --> 00:20:05,043
Don't do this, please!

342
00:20:05,123 --> 00:20:06,723
Don't
let them stop us!

343
00:20:11,763 --> 00:20:15,763
To be honest, I feel
guilty that I start this riot,

344
00:20:15,843 --> 00:20:19,003
and I'm sick and sitting
right here in a robe.

345
00:20:26,523 --> 00:20:28,483
Three, two, one, go!

346
00:20:45,283 --> 00:20:47,683
When you do work in
a virtual production,

347
00:20:47,763 --> 00:20:50,323
you have to create
content beforehand.

348
00:20:50,403 --> 00:20:54,803
You're kind of pulling postproduction
up front before shooting.

349
00:20:54,883 --> 00:20:57,163
It was new for
everyone on both sides,

350
00:20:57,243 --> 00:20:59,843
on our traditional
filmmaker side,

351
00:20:59,923 --> 00:21:03,483
but also on the side of the guys who
are actually doing all the backgrounds,

352
00:21:03,563 --> 00:21:05,163
Framestore from London.

353
00:21:07,283 --> 00:21:09,283
We started this
when there was no script.

354
00:21:09,363 --> 00:21:12,323
Jantje was writing.
The story was evolving.

355
00:21:12,403 --> 00:21:13,843
There was just an idea.

356
00:21:13,923 --> 00:21:17,163
With virtual production,
we have to provide content,

357
00:21:17,243 --> 00:21:19,083
visual effects, before we film,

358
00:21:19,163 --> 00:21:20,683
so that on the day when we film,

359
00:21:20,763 --> 00:21:24,003
we have content that we can
provide and get it in camera.

360
00:21:24,603 --> 00:21:26,363
It's great, no?

361
00:21:26,443 --> 00:21:29,643
The basic key for me as
a designer is there is no virtual set

362
00:21:29,723 --> 00:21:32,123
and the physical set
or different sets.

363
00:21:32,203 --> 00:21:36,243
There's a set, and the set
is following the story.

364
00:21:37,283 --> 00:21:40,323
The Volume itself, it's
logistically challenging.

365
00:21:40,403 --> 00:21:42,803
It requires far more prep time.

366
00:21:42,883 --> 00:21:45,603
You need to be close in contact
with all your colleagues.

367
00:21:46,723 --> 00:21:49,403
Working with Udo on
the production design

368
00:21:49,483 --> 00:21:52,043
was a new experience, I
think, for some of our artists

369
00:21:52,123 --> 00:21:55,563
because they were used to
receiving production designs,

370
00:21:55,643 --> 00:21:57,243
and just translating them.

371
00:21:57,323 --> 00:22:01,763
In this case, for 1899, we were
developing them from scratch with him.

372
00:22:01,843 --> 00:22:05,963
His sets needed to fit into our
environments or our virtual sets,

373
00:22:06,043 --> 00:22:08,963
and our virtual sets
needed to work with his.

374
00:22:09,043 --> 00:22:13,323
It's a lot of fun to do it and see
so many people, um, being on it.

375
00:22:13,403 --> 00:22:15,563
Not that feeling, "Ah,
I'll fix it in post."

376
00:22:15,643 --> 00:22:18,283
Or, "We do it now, and we
see later what's going on."

377
00:22:18,363 --> 00:22:22,643
It's now or never, and you get
the magic to be on the point.

378
00:22:22,723 --> 00:22:24,843
It's stressful, but
the payoff is amazing.

379
00:22:24,923 --> 00:22:26,443
Can you see my screen?

380
00:22:26,963 --> 00:22:28,043
Yes.

381
00:22:28,123 --> 00:22:32,563
Can you show the LED wall just so
I understand where it would be?

382
00:22:33,883 --> 00:22:36,723
Christian Kästner
and the team of Framestore,

383
00:22:36,803 --> 00:22:40,243
they shaped all this
in the beginning.

384
00:22:40,323 --> 00:22:43,083
So we had a lot of scoutings

385
00:22:43,163 --> 00:22:45,523
in a virtual world
of where we wanna go.

386
00:22:45,603 --> 00:22:48,643
What angles are we shooting? Where
could we stand with the camera?

387
00:22:48,723 --> 00:22:49,923
Where we wanna be?

388
00:22:50,003 --> 00:22:52,083
This one is still the
trickiest to sort out.

389
00:22:52,163 --> 00:22:55,083
Uh-huh. So where's
the shopping center?

390
00:22:57,323 --> 00:22:59,243
It's fun. You're
like a little child.

391
00:22:59,323 --> 00:23:03,083
You create worlds, and then you
feel like it's not real enough,

392
00:23:03,163 --> 00:23:05,083
and then you add stuff
here and add there.

393
00:23:05,163 --> 00:23:07,643
And step by step,
you're getting closer,

394
00:23:07,723 --> 00:23:12,443
creating a reality that doesn't feel like
it was created, but it actually exists.

395
00:23:14,483 --> 00:23:15,963
Yes, thanks.

396
00:23:16,043 --> 00:23:17,443
Could you go back?

397
00:23:25,603 --> 00:23:28,003
I sent a screenshot

398
00:23:28,523 --> 00:23:29,803
of an area I really liked.

399
00:23:29,883 --> 00:23:30,883
Do you see that?

400
00:23:30,963 --> 00:23:33,403
Bo was shooting
ocean plates in Scotland,

401
00:23:33,483 --> 00:23:36,643
and the helicopter captured a
valley that he really liked.

402
00:23:36,723 --> 00:23:39,403
He told us, "You know when
we talked about Scotland?"

403
00:23:39,483 --> 00:23:42,043
"This is what I really
would like it to look like."

404
00:23:42,123 --> 00:23:43,563
We decided very quickly,

405
00:23:43,643 --> 00:23:45,843
"Okay, let's go up and
scan the environment."

406
00:23:45,923 --> 00:23:48,843
So we did a drone scanning of
the environment, photogrammetry.

407
00:23:48,923 --> 00:23:52,323
After that, we modeled and…
and stitched the environment,

408
00:23:52,403 --> 00:23:54,843
and that's our
background for Scotland.

409
00:24:01,523 --> 00:24:03,003
Um, already much better.

410
00:24:03,083 --> 00:24:05,443
There's still some
kind of strange plants,

411
00:24:05,523 --> 00:24:06,523
some stragglers.

412
00:24:06,563 --> 00:24:09,243
They stand out quite a bit, especially
when we rotate to the right.

413
00:24:09,323 --> 00:24:11,403
So that's real rock? Fake rock?

414
00:24:11,483 --> 00:24:12,763
That's us too, right?

415
00:24:12,843 --> 00:24:15,363
Being such a core
part of the production,

416
00:24:15,443 --> 00:24:17,923
with 16 people live here

417
00:24:18,003 --> 00:24:19,523
when we're shooting every day,

418
00:24:19,603 --> 00:24:20,683
that's super exciting

419
00:24:20,763 --> 00:24:24,963
because for a lot of visual
effects artists, this is new.

420
00:24:28,003 --> 00:24:31,483
It's been, you know, a little bit
of a dream come true, I must say,

421
00:24:31,563 --> 00:24:34,283
that you can be
part of the puzzle.

422
00:24:44,243 --> 00:24:45,243
Where are we?

423
00:24:45,323 --> 00:24:46,563
How did we get here?

424
00:24:51,883 --> 00:24:55,163
What is very important
for me when it comes to the Volume work

425
00:24:55,243 --> 00:24:56,243
is the pre-lighting,

426
00:24:56,323 --> 00:24:59,163
so that I have time to
establish this world,

427
00:24:59,243 --> 00:25:00,723
to create the lighting here,

428
00:25:00,803 --> 00:25:04,523
and that whatever light mood
is in the preproduction,

429
00:25:04,603 --> 00:25:07,923
created on the wall, is actually
going into the foreground.

430
00:25:08,003 --> 00:25:10,123
And they, you know,
fit well together.

431
00:25:10,203 --> 00:25:13,523
And we're still 1899, so there's
no florescent lights or anything,

432
00:25:13,603 --> 00:25:15,203
so it should be all warmish.

433
00:25:15,283 --> 00:25:17,403
It's all fire-based
flames, basically.

434
00:25:17,483 --> 00:25:20,443
The Hong Kong harbor is my
favorite set, I would say.

435
00:25:20,523 --> 00:25:23,643
The mood that is created,
everything that is on the screens

436
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:26,403
and the foreground are
marrying so nicely together.

437
00:25:26,483 --> 00:25:27,923
It's just such an…

438
00:25:28,003 --> 00:25:30,003
Yeah, beautiful scenery.

439
00:25:30,523 --> 00:25:34,803
The ambience, the
peacefulness of this set,

440
00:25:34,883 --> 00:25:38,843
the way Nik sees the
light, how fast he works,

441
00:25:38,923 --> 00:25:43,723
they managed to create
something that was so…

442
00:25:44,443 --> 00:25:46,403
I don't know, that was

443
00:25:46,483 --> 00:25:49,003
the most beautiful set
I've ever seen in my life.

444
00:25:52,243 --> 00:25:55,523
You don't need to have
a part of your brain focused

445
00:25:55,603 --> 00:25:58,203
on projecting and imagining.

446
00:25:58,283 --> 00:26:00,443
You can just receive it.

447
00:26:02,723 --> 00:26:04,723
It looks real. It
really looks real.

448
00:26:04,803 --> 00:26:06,443
And it's a huge help for us.

449
00:26:06,523 --> 00:26:11,203
So we don't have to travel to the desert
nor to the North Pole nor to the glaciers.

450
00:26:11,283 --> 00:26:13,483
You can change that
within a minute.

451
00:26:14,363 --> 00:26:17,283
It would be a different
experience on green screen.

452
00:26:17,363 --> 00:26:20,563
It just illuminates, like,
literally everything.

453
00:26:20,643 --> 00:26:23,883
You can see the whole landscape in
front of you and the lighting and…

454
00:26:23,963 --> 00:26:25,923
So you're really
looking at the sea.

455
00:26:26,443 --> 00:26:28,843
It doesn't
get less thrilling.

456
00:26:29,483 --> 00:26:33,283
You may stay on a sound
stage for 14, 15 hours,

457
00:26:33,363 --> 00:26:37,483
but it still takes your breath
away that this is possible.

458
00:26:38,403 --> 00:26:42,563
It's so real that a lot of us,
when we first stepped onto the Volume,

459
00:26:42,643 --> 00:26:47,323
got seasick when we were watching
waves in the background go up and down.

460
00:26:47,403 --> 00:26:48,963
I said to Izzy, I was like,

461
00:26:49,483 --> 00:26:53,803
"I just can't believe that we've been
able to make a series on here, you know?"

462
00:26:53,883 --> 00:26:55,563
"It's just… It's incredible."

463
00:26:55,643 --> 00:26:58,483
She was saying, "I wanna do
something on location next,"

464
00:26:58,563 --> 00:27:02,043
and I said, "I absolutely don't.
I just wanna stay in here."

465
00:27:14,523 --> 00:27:19,483
So much has been going into
this kimono over so many months.

466
00:27:19,563 --> 00:27:23,443
All of the designs on this costume
have actually Incorporated elements

467
00:27:23,523 --> 00:27:24,603
from the entire show.

468
00:27:24,683 --> 00:27:28,683
On the bottom of my kimono, we
actually have the waves from the ocean.

469
00:27:28,763 --> 00:27:31,163
And then we have this
Japanese landscape,

470
00:27:31,243 --> 00:27:32,523
and it's embroidered.

471
00:27:33,043 --> 00:27:36,003
On my sleeves, there
are some mountains,

472
00:27:36,083 --> 00:27:40,043
um, upside down, like the camera
flips upside down many times.

473
00:27:40,123 --> 00:27:44,003
My favorite detail of this whole
thing is actually on the obi.

474
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:47,083
We have a cockroach
in the front,

475
00:27:47,163 --> 00:27:51,603
and we have a bunch of little
cockroaches in the shape of a triangle,

476
00:27:51,683 --> 00:27:55,483
which is the earth sign that
is shown a lot in the series.

477
00:28:04,643 --> 00:28:06,763
Are
they waiting outside already?

478
00:28:08,323 --> 00:28:10,803
You are all
third-class passengers.

479
00:28:10,883 --> 00:28:14,603
You really need to look
tired and exhausted.

480
00:28:14,683 --> 00:28:17,923
Wonderful extras,
beautiful, with costume and makeup.

481
00:28:18,003 --> 00:28:21,123
Could you put on
the hat? Thanks.

482
00:28:22,123 --> 00:28:24,323
It's
great to work with people

483
00:28:24,403 --> 00:28:25,963
we've already
worked with on Dark,

484
00:28:26,043 --> 00:28:29,563
but I think it's also great to have
some new additions in the team.

485
00:28:29,643 --> 00:28:33,123
And I'm especially
really thankful for Bina

486
00:28:33,203 --> 00:28:37,443
because she's just such a talent
and such a hardworking person.

487
00:28:37,523 --> 00:28:40,523
- Do you like it?
- It's a nice souvenir, no?

488
00:28:41,403 --> 00:28:45,563
All the costumes,
they are all done in our workroom.

489
00:28:45,643 --> 00:28:47,003
We made everything.

490
00:28:47,083 --> 00:28:49,883
We made all the shoes, the hats.

491
00:28:49,963 --> 00:28:51,563
There's a lot of embroidery.

492
00:28:52,483 --> 00:28:54,963
We printed a lot of fabrics.

493
00:28:55,043 --> 00:28:57,523
It was all dyed and aged.

494
00:28:57,603 --> 00:29:01,723
So the workroom was huge
and a very long process.

495
00:29:01,803 --> 00:29:05,403
Do you think it's
prettier when you do it this way?

496
00:29:05,483 --> 00:29:07,363
At the beginning,

497
00:29:07,443 --> 00:29:12,403
all the characters had
like four or five changes

498
00:29:12,483 --> 00:29:15,203
because of the different
dates of the story.

499
00:29:15,723 --> 00:29:19,603
When we discussed the
evolution of each character,

500
00:29:20,123 --> 00:29:21,123
we realized that

501
00:29:22,243 --> 00:29:27,083
we rather prefer that each
character has one hero piece,

502
00:29:27,163 --> 00:29:29,883
like a superhero costume.

503
00:29:31,723 --> 00:29:33,923
Basically, our
characters don't change.

504
00:29:34,003 --> 00:29:36,483
There's many days, and they
are in the same costume.

505
00:29:36,563 --> 00:29:40,643
And that's, of course, a clue to
that this is not really as it seems

506
00:29:40,723 --> 00:29:42,523
and maybe we're
not in a reality.

507
00:29:43,043 --> 00:29:47,003
Yeah, Maura is a very modern
character for her time.

508
00:29:49,883 --> 00:29:53,083
For Maura, we wanted
to have a more simple hairstyle.

509
00:29:53,163 --> 00:29:57,363
In this period, women secretly
do blush and lip tint.

510
00:29:57,883 --> 00:29:58,883
Maura does not.

511
00:29:59,523 --> 00:30:03,243
She also has very simple,
um, hair accessories

512
00:30:03,323 --> 00:30:06,483
as she has just two golden pins

513
00:30:06,563 --> 00:30:07,763
in the hairstyle.

514
00:30:09,803 --> 00:30:13,363
In 1899, all the women
still were wearing corsets.

515
00:30:13,443 --> 00:30:16,403
Wouldn't Maura,
perhaps, be a person

516
00:30:16,483 --> 00:30:18,723
who, once she is on the boat,

517
00:30:18,803 --> 00:30:21,643
she just forgets about
the corset and just said,

518
00:30:22,163 --> 00:30:24,763
"I am without it.
I'm done with it."

519
00:30:26,443 --> 00:30:31,603
It has been such a joy to see
how the characters actually are shaped

520
00:30:31,683 --> 00:30:33,923
by the costumes
they are wearing.

521
00:30:34,003 --> 00:30:36,083
And it has been for
me, as a writer,

522
00:30:36,683 --> 00:30:38,163
really inspiring

523
00:30:38,243 --> 00:30:40,123
to see how costume and makeup

524
00:30:40,203 --> 00:30:43,483
influence also my choices
on the characters.

525
00:30:43,563 --> 00:30:45,323
You
know what they say?

526
00:30:46,283 --> 00:30:51,883
Men invented dresses and heels
so that women can't run away.

527
00:31:13,403 --> 00:31:17,123
To find that location,
to find the look of the story,

528
00:31:17,203 --> 00:31:20,803
was probably the biggest challenge
art department had to face.

529
00:31:21,323 --> 00:31:22,683
There's no ship of that era

530
00:31:22,763 --> 00:31:25,443
which is still floating
somewhere or in a museum.

531
00:31:25,523 --> 00:31:26,523
They're all gone.

532
00:31:27,883 --> 00:31:31,163
We're talking about a ship
which is 330 meters long

533
00:31:31,243 --> 00:31:35,043
and was made to travel
over the North Atlantic.

534
00:31:35,123 --> 00:31:37,803
And to recreate
these environments

535
00:31:37,883 --> 00:31:41,083
is something which takes a lot of
energy from a production designer.

536
00:31:41,163 --> 00:31:43,003
That's the
first pipe, second pipe.

537
00:31:43,043 --> 00:31:44,923
I'm
addicted to details.

538
00:31:45,963 --> 00:31:49,283
Could be the architecture, the
surfaces, the moldings, the props,

539
00:31:49,363 --> 00:31:52,683
the set decoration, the right
things at the right place.

540
00:31:57,843 --> 00:31:59,683
We had a lot
of reference materials.

541
00:31:59,763 --> 00:32:03,003
And I think this is a
good thing to start,

542
00:32:03,083 --> 00:32:07,283
so that you have a feeling for this
period, you have to know the rules.

543
00:32:07,363 --> 00:32:10,083
You have to know what you can
do and what you shouldn't do.

544
00:32:10,163 --> 00:32:13,883
Or if you break the rules, then
you should do it on purpose

545
00:32:13,963 --> 00:32:15,683
and not because you didn't know.

546
00:32:15,763 --> 00:32:17,803
1899, what would they have?

547
00:32:17,883 --> 00:32:19,803
No, you should be
sure about that,

548
00:32:19,883 --> 00:32:23,083
and then you see what you can
find, and you build it around that.

549
00:32:29,203 --> 00:32:31,803
We're moving on!

550
00:32:35,603 --> 00:32:37,843
The world is
very big, visually.

551
00:32:38,963 --> 00:32:41,323
The sets are incredible.

552
00:32:41,923 --> 00:32:44,083
One especially for me
is the engine room,

553
00:32:44,603 --> 00:32:46,803
where there's secret panels,

554
00:32:46,883 --> 00:32:50,563
and we find these incredible,
designed futuristic machines,

555
00:32:50,643 --> 00:32:53,763
which are mother brains,
to operate the simulation.

556
00:32:53,843 --> 00:32:55,963
And I seem to know
where all of them are,

557
00:32:56,043 --> 00:32:59,163
and… and I'm able
to manipulate them.

558
00:33:04,243 --> 00:33:06,923
I have a device, which is
this wonderful silver thing.

559
00:33:07,003 --> 00:33:08,363
It's got moving plates on it,

560
00:33:08,443 --> 00:33:10,883
which are different codings

561
00:33:11,603 --> 00:33:14,203
so I can plug it into
these motherboard computers

562
00:33:14,283 --> 00:33:17,203
and manipulate the
simulation itself.

563
00:33:19,883 --> 00:33:21,923
Even if we use something
like the Volume,

564
00:33:22,003 --> 00:33:24,803
we want to create as much
as possible in-camera.

565
00:33:24,883 --> 00:33:28,043
So everything needs
to feel believable

566
00:33:28,123 --> 00:33:29,923
and that you can touch it.

567
00:33:31,563 --> 00:33:34,923
In Dark, we had the time machine,
and here, we have a weird object.

568
00:33:35,003 --> 00:33:37,403
We're really fans of gadgets.

569
00:33:37,483 --> 00:33:42,243
The design behind these
gadgets are very, like, steampunk-esque

570
00:33:42,323 --> 00:33:44,523
but of a completely
different world.

571
00:33:45,603 --> 00:33:48,523
1899, through its design, is
creating its own genre almost.

572
00:34:20,723 --> 00:34:22,003
What's going on?

573
00:34:29,203 --> 00:34:30,203
Follow me.

574
00:34:32,123 --> 00:34:33,763
It's like a living organism.

575
00:34:33,843 --> 00:34:37,483
You don't know what it's doing with
you. It's a little bit alien-esque.

576
00:34:38,003 --> 00:34:42,363
We said from the beginning the
ship should be its own character.

577
00:34:42,443 --> 00:34:45,523
That you feel it's
like a weird monster.

578
00:34:46,803 --> 00:34:49,483
We wanted to see the
ship not just as a period ship,

579
00:34:49,563 --> 00:34:51,163
steaming across the Atlantic.

580
00:34:51,243 --> 00:34:53,923
It's more like a living
structure in itself.

581
00:34:54,003 --> 00:34:58,923
The anti-Titanic, leading directly
into the brain of each character.

582
00:35:07,243 --> 00:35:09,803
We can go from
one cabin to the next

583
00:35:09,883 --> 00:35:13,483
through hidden shafts,
ventilation chambers, tubes,

584
00:35:13,563 --> 00:35:16,963
places that transport
the sensation of,

585
00:35:17,043 --> 00:35:19,683
"My God, there's a door
behind the wall" feeling.

586
00:35:20,363 --> 00:35:21,803
"I want to see behind the wall."

587
00:35:21,883 --> 00:35:25,643
You feel that you get deeper and deeper
into something that you should stay out.

588
00:35:25,723 --> 00:35:27,603
I like this kind of tension.

589
00:35:28,363 --> 00:35:29,363
Look at this.

590
00:35:29,923 --> 00:35:30,923
Oh.

591
00:35:32,763 --> 00:35:34,123
Then I disappear.

592
00:35:43,203 --> 00:35:44,203
Whew!

593
00:36:03,003 --> 00:36:05,923
1899 was recorded
all over the world.

594
00:36:06,603 --> 00:36:09,363
The Tangram Ensemble
from London.

595
00:36:11,123 --> 00:36:13,203
Sinfonietta Cracovia,

596
00:36:13,283 --> 00:36:16,083
this amazing string section, the
same people I worked with on Dark.

597
00:36:18,523 --> 00:36:21,163
And then there's actually
quite a lot of vocal material.

598
00:36:23,643 --> 00:36:24,963
They are the three
main elements.

599
00:36:25,003 --> 00:36:28,243
And there's everything that
I'm sort of doing with that.

600
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:33,523
I took a lot of that
material with me

601
00:36:33,603 --> 00:36:37,043
here back to Iceland
and took it into

602
00:36:37,123 --> 00:36:39,923
various ships down
here in the harbor.

603
00:36:40,443 --> 00:36:41,683
So I'm taking those recordings

604
00:36:41,763 --> 00:36:44,723
and actually feeding them
through a speaker, um,

605
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:47,163
into various parts of the ship,

606
00:36:47,243 --> 00:36:50,523
and sort of using the
music to resonate…

607
00:36:50,603 --> 00:36:54,603
literally resonate
the hull of the boat.

608
00:36:58,603 --> 00:37:00,683
Kinda terrifying, honestly.

609
00:37:01,203 --> 00:37:02,843
It… It becomes something else.

610
00:37:02,923 --> 00:37:04,723
It becomes very, um, alive.

611
00:37:27,643 --> 00:37:30,723
Our brain is a
very complicated construct.

612
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:36,483
As much as we can try to forget the
things we don't want to remember,

613
00:37:36,563 --> 00:37:39,643
we will never be able
to delete them entirely.

614
00:37:39,723 --> 00:37:41,123
They're part of who we are.

615
00:37:42,883 --> 00:37:45,203
Woven into our very fabric.

616
00:37:46,723 --> 00:37:48,763
And landscape!

617
00:37:56,163 --> 00:37:57,723
There's no
reason to be afraid.

618
00:37:57,763 --> 00:37:59,443
This isn't real.

619
00:38:01,243 --> 00:38:02,803
Remember?

620
00:38:04,483 --> 00:38:07,883
It's so complex that I couldn't
say, "Well, it's about this."

621
00:38:07,963 --> 00:38:10,163
It's about
so many things.

622
00:38:10,243 --> 00:38:14,843
And, um, I guess if you
ask me what it's about

623
00:38:14,923 --> 00:38:17,803
and you ask someone else, and
you get different answers,

624
00:38:18,683 --> 00:38:20,003
in a way, they're both true.

625
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:23,643
I guess I think 1899… Yes,
it's incredibly confusing.

626
00:38:23,723 --> 00:38:25,443
And, um, all of these…

627
00:38:25,523 --> 00:38:28,723
No, I don't wanna say
that. Um, okay.

628
00:38:28,803 --> 00:38:31,083
Should not say it's
incredibly confusing.

629
00:38:31,163 --> 00:38:34,883
My picture of it is like a round
puzzle that is moving at great speed,

630
00:38:34,963 --> 00:38:36,803
and Jantje's putting
in the pieces.

631
00:38:36,883 --> 00:38:37,963
I have no idea.

632
00:38:38,043 --> 00:38:41,163
I mean, I have no idea how
she keeps it all straight.

633
00:38:41,243 --> 00:38:43,283
I mean, I don't
know how they do it.

634
00:38:45,003 --> 00:38:48,643
The only thing that I think
that's really important with mystery

635
00:38:48,723 --> 00:38:54,043
is that you don't listen to anyone
who says, "I didn't understand this,"

636
00:38:54,123 --> 00:38:56,923
or, "I think this needs
to be made clearer,"

637
00:38:57,003 --> 00:38:58,043
or anything like that.

638
00:38:58,123 --> 00:38:59,163
I just go, "La, la."

639
00:39:00,563 --> 00:39:04,363
I gave up to try and understand
her brain a long time ago.

640
00:39:04,963 --> 00:39:09,483
She puts different, strange
worlds together into one,

641
00:39:09,563 --> 00:39:11,643
and you think there's no way

642
00:39:11,723 --> 00:39:13,843
they can ever connect,
they can ever be combined.

643
00:39:13,923 --> 00:39:18,403
But then later on, it reveals that the one
is actually the source of the other one.

644
00:39:22,923 --> 00:39:24,723
I'm a
huge puzzle freak.

645
00:39:24,803 --> 00:39:25,923
I love mysteries,

646
00:39:26,003 --> 00:39:29,083
and I love, um, solving
any kind of riddles.

647
00:39:29,163 --> 00:39:31,563
For me now to be like the person

648
00:39:31,643 --> 00:39:34,803
who actually builds the
riddle is just pure pleasure.

649
00:39:34,883 --> 00:39:37,923
So I'm actually, yes, I'm
doing it for the fans,

650
00:39:38,003 --> 00:39:40,563
but I'm also doing
it for myself.

651
00:39:40,643 --> 00:39:43,243
Jantje is
doing all the writing.

652
00:39:43,843 --> 00:39:46,843
Uh, the rest of us are
on set with Bo directing.

653
00:39:46,923 --> 00:39:50,523
As things are being dripped back
to Jantje within the edit room,

654
00:39:50,603 --> 00:39:53,443
she can really see what's
working, what isn't working,

655
00:39:53,523 --> 00:39:55,843
how things could be
more interesting.

656
00:39:55,923 --> 00:39:59,243
They have this flexibility
to move the story

657
00:39:59,323 --> 00:40:00,763
in any direction they want.

658
00:40:03,043 --> 00:40:05,323
I might see a
prop in the background

659
00:40:05,403 --> 00:40:06,963
that art department put there.

660
00:40:07,043 --> 00:40:10,963
For example, in Ramiro
and Ángel's cabin,

661
00:40:11,043 --> 00:40:15,083
there is an old picture of a
wolf and a lamb on the wall,

662
00:40:15,163 --> 00:40:17,403
and that inspired me to
actually write a dialogue

663
00:40:17,483 --> 00:40:21,283
that kind of grasps
those two characters.

664
00:40:22,163 --> 00:40:24,643
Why don't you have
a little conversation with God?

665
00:40:25,403 --> 00:40:27,843
Ask him why he turned
you into a sheep

666
00:40:28,363 --> 00:40:29,643
and me into a wolf.

667
00:40:31,443 --> 00:40:33,203
The power of… of
decisions here in the show

668
00:40:33,283 --> 00:40:35,603
are very centralized in
them, in Bo and Jantje,

669
00:40:35,683 --> 00:40:37,243
and I think that's really good.

670
00:40:37,763 --> 00:40:40,723
It adds a lot of personality,
their personality.

671
00:40:42,123 --> 00:40:44,883
It's still the
mind of Bo and Jantje.

672
00:40:44,963 --> 00:40:48,123
They didn't step away from what
they want and what they like.

673
00:40:48,203 --> 00:40:50,083
They like weirdness.

674
00:40:50,163 --> 00:40:51,643
They like fantasies.

675
00:40:51,723 --> 00:40:53,123
They like mystery.

676
00:40:53,203 --> 00:40:54,963
They like fucking
with your mind.

677
00:40:55,043 --> 00:40:58,283
And that's what they do. Even
with us sometimes, actors.

678
00:40:58,363 --> 00:41:01,683
We were like, "We wanna ask about
season two for our characters."

679
00:41:01,763 --> 00:41:04,963
They were like, "No! You do
season one, and then you'll see."

680
00:41:05,043 --> 00:41:07,243
When you
go into a scene,

681
00:41:07,323 --> 00:41:10,483
and you've got 100
questions for Bo,

682
00:41:10,563 --> 00:41:12,883
and he goes, "I haven't
made that choice yet."

683
00:41:12,963 --> 00:41:16,403
"I don't know if I want this character
to go down that road or that one yet."

684
00:41:16,483 --> 00:41:20,483
"So let's see where we take
it where you don't know."

685
00:41:20,563 --> 00:41:22,083
"Yeah, okay, great."

686
00:41:22,163 --> 00:41:23,763
"That's really helpful."

687
00:41:23,843 --> 00:41:27,203
But, you know, that's the… that
is the interesting thing about it.

688
00:41:27,283 --> 00:41:30,523
In that moment, you have to make a
natural choice of the circumstances…

689
00:41:31,563 --> 00:41:34,643
…and play that and
play the honesty of the moment,

690
00:41:34,723 --> 00:41:36,363
regardless of where
it's going next.

691
00:41:36,443 --> 00:41:38,163
Maura, please.

692
00:41:38,243 --> 00:41:40,283
Get in there.

693
00:41:41,843 --> 00:41:44,123
I know all of this

694
00:41:44,203 --> 00:41:47,363
must be quite confusing for you.

695
00:41:49,723 --> 00:41:52,723
You feel a safety in the
hands of people who have this pedigree.

696
00:41:52,803 --> 00:41:54,843
They've done this
amazing series before.

697
00:41:54,923 --> 00:41:58,923
And yet you feel they are
operating in a very free way.

698
00:41:59,003 --> 00:42:04,323
And the way it starts out may be
the way it continues or it may not.

699
00:42:04,923 --> 00:42:08,963
I've not come across that
a lot in modern drama.

700
00:42:09,483 --> 00:42:10,363
The key.

701
00:42:14,803 --> 00:42:17,643
Everyone, please
assemble in the dining room.

702
00:42:17,723 --> 00:42:20,643
The captain would like to
address the current situation.

703
00:42:21,283 --> 00:42:22,363
What's happening?

704
00:42:22,443 --> 00:42:24,003
They're not telling us a thing.

705
00:42:24,083 --> 00:42:26,643
That's what you get when you
have a German running this.

706
00:42:29,123 --> 00:42:33,283
I don't know if it's similar because
I've never been a captain on a ship, um,

707
00:42:33,363 --> 00:42:37,163
but I guess it's
maybe as exhausting.

708
00:42:39,843 --> 00:42:40,843
Olek!

709
00:42:47,563 --> 00:42:49,283
If you wanna
have family on the set,

710
00:42:49,363 --> 00:42:52,083
then you also have to create
a safe place for everyone,

711
00:42:52,163 --> 00:42:56,243
and especially for the actors
because you ask so much from them

712
00:42:56,323 --> 00:42:59,203
to do in front of a
camera, almost being naked.

713
00:43:05,723 --> 00:43:08,283
He's a very dark
soul.

714
00:43:08,883 --> 00:43:10,443
Which is very cool.

715
00:43:11,483 --> 00:43:14,763
He's not afraid of
the ugliness or…

716
00:43:16,563 --> 00:43:18,883
the deep dark secrets

717
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:21,603
or sorrow or grief

718
00:43:21,683 --> 00:43:26,923
or… just all the dark
sides that humans have.

719
00:43:27,603 --> 00:43:31,203
And I just love to have a
director who wanna go in there.

720
00:43:32,003 --> 00:43:35,403
I'm not good if
I don't trust the director.

721
00:43:35,923 --> 00:43:39,323
And if a director doesn't make
me feel like I can go to places

722
00:43:39,403 --> 00:43:40,643
which are very vulnerable,

723
00:43:40,723 --> 00:43:43,043
I can't give you my all.

724
00:43:43,643 --> 00:43:48,163
I feel comfortable enough to explore
what the possibilities are because of Bo.

725
00:43:48,843 --> 00:43:51,323
And that's a good captain,
to make you feel safe

726
00:43:51,403 --> 00:43:53,003
in a very vulnerable place.

727
00:43:55,323 --> 00:43:58,323
Him and Jantje, they
both know what they want.

728
00:43:58,843 --> 00:44:01,163
Sometimes they don't know
how they wanna get there.

729
00:44:01,243 --> 00:44:05,403
Then you're a part of that creative
team, so you help them get there.

730
00:44:05,923 --> 00:44:08,363
And there's a great essence
of family because of that.

731
00:44:13,763 --> 00:44:16,963
It's been such a journey.
I get so emotional.

732
00:44:21,803 --> 00:44:23,163
People here are amazing.

733
00:44:24,723 --> 00:44:28,563
I met actors from all over the
world with different cultures.

734
00:44:29,323 --> 00:44:33,243
I hope that people see that
no matter where you're from,

735
00:44:33,323 --> 00:44:37,443
no matter your skin tone,
no matter your religion,

736
00:44:37,523 --> 00:44:41,123
we're just equal, we're
just all just human beings.

737
00:44:41,643 --> 00:44:45,563
It is the same hurt,
love, and happiness.

738
00:44:46,683 --> 00:44:47,763
We're on the same boat.

739
00:44:49,203 --> 00:44:53,483
You're looking for what you have in
common and you try to build up a synergy

740
00:44:53,563 --> 00:44:56,963
to create together, and that's what
we're doing here internationally.

741
00:44:57,883 --> 00:45:01,643
Especially during our time,
with COVID and Brexit,

742
00:45:01,723 --> 00:45:05,523
and everyone wants to
become way more selfish

743
00:45:05,603 --> 00:45:07,723
than they probably already were.

744
00:45:07,803 --> 00:45:10,883
It's just great just to see
that we're all together.

745
00:45:10,963 --> 00:45:13,643
And this is the beautiful
story about 1899.

746
00:45:13,723 --> 00:45:17,123
If you actually wanna survive,
we have to be together.

747
00:45:17,203 --> 00:45:18,883
No one can survive on their own.

748
00:45:33,203 --> 00:45:35,803
I will definitely
fall into a hole

749
00:45:35,883 --> 00:45:38,283
after the end of this shoot.

750
00:45:38,363 --> 00:45:39,723
You always do.

751
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:41,243
'Cause I really…

752
00:45:41,883 --> 00:45:44,363
No one sees me behind
my monitors in my tent,

753
00:45:44,443 --> 00:45:47,883
but I do, uh, live the
characters as well.

754
00:45:47,963 --> 00:45:50,643
And I do act in front of the
monitors. No one sees that.

755
00:45:50,723 --> 00:45:54,683
Just to try to understand what
that character could do or not.

756
00:45:55,283 --> 00:45:57,923
Of course, in a very bad way
because I'm not a good actor.

757
00:45:58,003 --> 00:46:00,763
But, like, I really
live these characters,

758
00:46:00,843 --> 00:46:03,603
and it's sad always to
say goodbye to them.

759
00:46:04,123 --> 00:46:07,923
But maybe hopefully we will say hello
again to them in another season.

760
00:46:10,683 --> 00:46:12,243
This is where they shot Alien.

761
00:46:12,763 --> 00:46:14,003
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

762
00:46:14,683 --> 00:46:16,403
So it has good history.

763
00:46:20,723 --> 00:46:21,563
Thank you, sir.

764
00:46:21,643 --> 00:46:22,723
You're welcome, sir.

765
00:46:27,843 --> 00:46:28,843
Hello.

766
00:46:29,403 --> 00:46:31,203
- Hello.
- Hello there.

767
00:46:31,283 --> 00:46:34,763
It is of course a bit
of an undercut, as we had discussed.

768
00:46:34,843 --> 00:46:35,843
Yeah.

769
00:46:36,443 --> 00:46:37,843
How
are you feeling?

770
00:46:37,923 --> 00:46:40,323
Yeah. It's
growing on me. I like it.

771
00:46:40,843 --> 00:46:42,283
It looks pretty cool.

772
00:46:45,123 --> 00:46:46,723
- Hello.
- Hello.

773
00:46:46,803 --> 00:46:49,883
- Ah! Now you're a footballer?
- I'm a footballer.

774
00:46:50,923 --> 00:46:52,003
Where is your beard?

775
00:46:52,083 --> 00:46:53,283
Yeah, man.

776
00:46:54,803 --> 00:46:57,363
- See ya in a minute. See you.
- See you.

777
00:46:57,443 --> 00:46:58,443
Yeah.

778
00:47:03,523 --> 00:47:05,523
Then we'll go…

779
00:47:05,603 --> 00:47:07,563
- It looks pretty amazing.
- Yeah.

780
00:47:07,643 --> 00:47:09,363
And we have to fit
all the actors in.

781
00:47:09,443 --> 00:47:11,923
Actually, let's start with
the people in the pods.

782
00:47:12,003 --> 00:47:14,963
Jérôme, Clémence, Virginia, Eyk,

783
00:47:15,483 --> 00:47:17,403
Maura, Krester,

784
00:47:17,483 --> 00:47:19,483
Tove, and Olek.

785
00:47:28,563 --> 00:47:29,563
Get used to it.

786
00:47:29,643 --> 00:47:31,163
This is season two,

787
00:47:31,243 --> 00:47:32,283
just like this.

788
00:47:33,283 --> 00:47:35,403
- In this box?
- But beautiful dialogues.

789
00:47:35,483 --> 00:47:37,243
Yeah, beautiful.
It's so well written.

790
00:47:37,323 --> 00:47:39,363
Okay, let's
stand by to shoot.

791
00:47:39,883 --> 00:47:41,203
Rolling sound.

792
00:47:42,203 --> 00:47:43,643
And action.

793
00:48:16,163 --> 00:48:17,523
The ring. The ring.

794
00:48:20,043 --> 00:48:23,403
- Cut. Very good. Moving on.
- Cut. And cut.

795
00:48:29,403 --> 00:48:31,243
Good news.
It looks awesome.

796
00:48:52,443 --> 00:48:54,763
Then at the end, your head
as straight as possible.

797
00:48:54,843 --> 00:48:56,203
'Cause you're going into…

798
00:49:08,483 --> 00:49:10,923
I want to wrap.

799
00:49:11,723 --> 00:49:15,763
- Aw, so sweet.
- "With love."

800
00:49:16,283 --> 00:49:19,683
And now my postcard. Thank you.

801
00:49:20,203 --> 00:49:22,203
There. Where's
the champagne?

802
00:49:22,963 --> 00:49:26,763
Everyone, we're super quiet 'cause
it's the last one on the cast.

803
00:49:26,843 --> 00:49:28,443
1899.

804
00:49:28,523 --> 00:49:29,523
Boom!

805
00:49:32,563 --> 00:49:33,963
If this isn't iconic…

806
00:49:40,123 --> 00:49:41,483
And…

807
00:49:44,123 --> 00:49:45,363
action!

808
00:50:09,123 --> 00:50:10,123
Cut!

809
00:50:12,043 --> 00:50:12,883
That's a wrap!

810
00:50:23,803 --> 00:50:27,683
So guys, it was a pleasure
and honor working with you.

811
00:50:27,763 --> 00:50:29,003
You're a fantastic cast.

812
00:50:29,083 --> 00:50:31,603
I thank you from the
bottom of my heart.

813
00:50:31,683 --> 00:50:34,203
It was a hell of a ride,

814
00:50:35,203 --> 00:50:37,763
hell of a cast,
hell of characters,

815
00:50:37,843 --> 00:50:39,523
hell of everything.

816
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:41,763
I love you all, really. Really.

817
00:50:41,843 --> 00:50:44,043
Thank you. Thank you very much.

818
00:50:53,243 --> 00:50:54,243
Well done.

819
00:51:08,643 --> 00:51:12,403
Bo, from all the cast,
this is a little gift.

820
00:51:12,483 --> 00:51:14,203
There you go. It's for you.

821
00:51:16,523 --> 00:51:18,363
This is awesome!

822
00:51:26,563 --> 00:51:27,683
I want this picture.

823
00:51:27,763 --> 00:51:30,363
This is amazing.
Thank you very much.
