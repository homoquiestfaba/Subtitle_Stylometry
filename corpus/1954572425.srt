1
00:00:41,742 --> 00:00:43,288
Mom?

2
00:00:45,943 --> 00:00:48,783
- Kat?
- You okay?

3
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,893
Yeah.

4
00:00:51,548 --> 00:00:53,438
I'm fine

5
00:00:54,186 --> 00:00:58,171
- Why are you all dressed up?
- What do you mean?

6
00:01:01,528 --> 00:01:04,537
- What time is it?
- Almost five.

7
00:01:04,637 --> 00:01:06,232
Really?

8
00:01:07,933 --> 00:01:10,300
I need to get dinner started.

9
00:01:18,679 --> 00:01:21,514
<i>I was 17 when my mother disappeared.</i>

10
00:01:22,115 --> 00:01:24,770
<i>Just as I was becoming
nothing but my body,</i>

11
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:28,787
<i>flesh and blood, and raging hormones.</i>

12
00:01:30,388 --> 00:01:33,089
<i>She stepped out of hers
and left it behind.</i>

13
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:10,657
Hi, Mrs. Hillman. Is Phil home?

14
00:03:10,757 --> 00:03:14,544
No. I'm sorry, Katrina.
He's... he's not back yet.

15
00:03:14,644 --> 00:03:16,114
Really?

16
00:03:17,362 --> 00:03:19,299
Supposed to pick me up from school.

17
00:03:19,699 --> 00:03:22,703
I'm sure he's on his way.
You know how he is.

18
00:03:23,299 --> 00:03:26,573
Would you like to come in and...
and wait for him?

19
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,676
That's okay.
Just tell him that I stopped by.

20
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:31,244
I will.

21
00:03:31,344 --> 00:03:35,347
- Thanks, Mrs. Hillman.
- Oh, no problem, dear.

22
00:04:09,649 --> 00:04:10,683
Dad?

23
00:04:11,884 --> 00:04:14,105
What are you doing home already?

24
00:04:16,787 --> 00:04:20,625
- Have you seen your mother?
- No, why?

25
00:04:23,227 --> 00:04:24,929
She's gone.

26
00:04:25,865 --> 00:04:28,000
What do you mean she's gone?

27
00:04:28,101 --> 00:04:30,736
I came home and she wasn't here.

28
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:34,038
She's probably at the
store or something.

29
00:04:35,373 --> 00:04:36,528
Her car is in the garage.

30
00:04:36,977 --> 00:04:40,410
Oh, my God, stop being so melodramatic.
She'll turn up.

31
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:45,318
I called everyone. Nobody's seen her.

32
00:04:45,418 --> 00:04:48,519
Dad, don't worry.
I'm sure everything's fine.

33
00:04:50,588 --> 00:04:52,123
Yeah.

34
00:04:53,925 --> 00:04:55,832
I'm going to my room.

35
00:05:00,133 --> 00:05:02,803
Yeah, it was weird.
She didn't leave a note or anything.

36
00:05:02,903 --> 00:05:05,272
And dad is totally freaking out.

37
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,774
Where do you think she is?

38
00:05:08,375 --> 00:05:12,941
Maybe she finally left him. She's been
threatening to for all these years.

39
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:17,184
Well, was she, like,
acting weird or something?

40
00:05:17,284 --> 00:05:19,186
<i>No weirder than usual.</i>

41
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:24,201
Actually, no. Last week I came home from
school and I found her sleeping in my bed.

42
00:05:24,757 --> 00:05:28,095
- What?
- Yeah. Random, right?

43
00:05:28,195 --> 00:05:31,565
When she woke up, she seemed like,
all confused and out of it.

44
00:05:31,665 --> 00:05:34,050
<i>I think she was still half in a dream.</i>

45
00:05:36,069 --> 00:05:39,602
So, anyways, where the
hell were you today?

46
00:05:40,373 --> 00:05:42,008
Oh, yeah.

47
00:05:42,108 --> 00:05:44,478
Sorry, I... I was hanging
out at Thomas', and...

48
00:05:44,578 --> 00:05:47,329
<i>And you were stoned.</i>

49
00:05:49,757 --> 00:05:51,317
Maybe.

50
00:05:51,951 --> 00:05:54,020
You want me to come over?

51
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:56,456
<i>I don't know, I kind of have
a lot of homework to do.</i>

52
00:05:56,556 --> 00:05:58,625
Since when do you give
a shit about homework?

53
00:05:58,725 --> 00:06:01,528
My mom's been on my case
lately about my grades.

54
00:06:01,628 --> 00:06:05,094
Phil, we haven't had sex in,
like, over a week.

55
00:06:06,131 --> 00:06:07,731
I miss fucking you.

56
00:06:08,667 --> 00:06:12,372
Same here, babe. But...
you know what they say.

57
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,374
Absence makes the heart get stronger.

58
00:06:17,968 --> 00:06:19,455
Yeah.

59
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:23,817
- Phil, are you in there?
- I'm on the phone.

60
00:06:23,917 --> 00:06:25,852
Could you come out here
for a minute, honey?

61
00:06:25,952 --> 00:06:28,655
I heard a strange noise outside.

62
00:06:28,755 --> 00:06:31,791
You're always hearing strange noises.

63
00:06:31,891 --> 00:06:34,126
Yeah, I'll be out in a sec.

64
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:38,060
I gotta go. My crazy mom
is imagining things again.

65
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:42,298
'Kay. Talk to you later.

66
00:06:42,769 --> 00:06:44,305
<i>Okay.</i>

67
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:59,017
So, no word?

68
00:07:39,492 --> 00:07:41,827
You think we should call the police?

69
00:07:46,898 --> 00:07:49,302
I don't want them coming here
for all the neighbours to see.

70
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,537
Your mother wouldn't like it.

71
00:08:02,014 --> 00:08:04,747
If we don't hear anything by morning,

72
00:08:05,652 --> 00:08:08,487
let's take a drive down to the station.

73
00:08:19,265 --> 00:08:20,846
Mom?

74
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:31,543
Mom?

75
00:08:52,832 --> 00:08:54,233
Mom?

76
00:08:56,134 --> 00:08:57,601
Mom, what happened?

77
00:09:14,020 --> 00:09:18,123
<i>When I was little, my mother
tried to curl my hair.</i>

78
00:09:23,162 --> 00:09:24,630
Oh, well. We tried.

79
00:09:26,031 --> 00:09:28,635
It looks a little fuller, I suppose.

80
00:09:28,735 --> 00:09:31,504
<i>She named me Katrina so
that she could call me Kat,</i>

81
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:33,974
<i>because she always wanted a pet.</i>

82
00:09:34,394 --> 00:09:35,285
Come here, Kat.

83
00:09:36,592 --> 00:09:40,071
Purr for me, kitty. Come on. Purr.

84
00:09:43,282 --> 00:09:46,848
That's it. Good, good little kitty.

85
00:09:47,053 --> 00:09:50,054
<i>For years I thought I was her pet.</i>

86
00:10:03,069 --> 00:10:05,230
Kat?

87
00:10:05,330 --> 00:10:07,604
Kat?

88
00:10:11,311 --> 00:10:13,045
Mama?

89
00:10:17,917 --> 00:10:19,239
I'm here, Kat.

90
00:10:20,451 --> 00:10:22,239
I'm here.

91
00:10:32,765 --> 00:10:34,037
No more for you.

92
00:10:34,937 --> 00:10:37,854
God, you're getting fatter by the hour.

93
00:10:37,954 --> 00:10:42,609
<i>My mother always wanted me to be a sylph,
all lithe and elegant like her.</i>

94
00:10:42,909 --> 00:10:46,679
<i>And when I hit puberty, my body
changed seemingly overnight,</i>

95
00:10:46,779 --> 00:10:49,849
<i>the bulk melting off like
I was a snowman in the sun.</i>

96
00:10:49,949 --> 00:10:52,218
<i>Only, instead of finally pleasing her,</i>

97
00:10:52,318 --> 00:10:55,054
<i>that somehow made her
resent me even more.</i>

98
00:10:55,154 --> 00:10:58,587
- Do you love the boy?
- God, Jesus, you scared me.

99
00:10:58,958 --> 00:11:01,160
How long have you been standing there?

100
00:11:01,861 --> 00:11:04,362
Sorry, I didn't mean to startle you.

101
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:10,426
- Well, are you going to answer my question?
- What question?

102
00:11:10,526 --> 00:11:13,740
That boy next door. Do you love him?

103
00:11:14,140 --> 00:11:17,575
What are you talking about?
It's none of your business.

104
00:11:20,313 --> 00:11:22,848
I don't love your father.

105
00:11:22,949 --> 00:11:25,952
- I can't stand him, as a matter of fact.
- What the fuck?

106
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:29,220
Why would you say that to me?
Go fuckin' tell it to someone else.

107
00:11:36,496 --> 00:11:37,695
So no note?

108
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,999
No. Nothing.

109
00:11:45,469 --> 00:11:47,707
You say she didn't pack a bag.

110
00:11:48,574 --> 00:11:52,777
Well, nothing seems to be
missing as far as I can tell.

111
00:11:59,252 --> 00:12:03,523
<i>The detective was the polar opposite
of men like my father, and Phil.</i>

112
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:06,559
<i>He was the kind of man who
carried a gun, got into fights,</i>

113
00:12:06,659 --> 00:12:09,162
<i>killed things with his bare hands.</i>

114
00:12:10,163 --> 00:12:14,968
Was she depressed? Was she on any
kind of medication, or taking anything?

115
00:12:15,068 --> 00:12:18,870
She didn't kill herself, if that's
what you're trying to imply.

116
00:12:24,510 --> 00:12:27,254
Well, the good news is, that...

117
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:30,547
there's no matches at any
of the hospitals or morgue.

118
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:34,194
No evidence of foul play.

119
00:12:34,294 --> 00:12:37,656
However, and I hate to be
the one to tell you this,

120
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:41,657
hundreds of wives go missing every week.

121
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:45,765
If a woman wants to vanish,
buddy, she can.

122
00:12:45,865 --> 00:12:48,266
Are you saying there's
nothing we can do?

123
00:12:48,467 --> 00:12:52,104
Oh, sure there is. I recommend you
alert your friends, your neighbours.

124
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,674
Tell them to be on the lookout.

125
00:12:54,774 --> 00:12:56,080
Keep an eye on your bank account,

126
00:12:56,180 --> 00:12:59,546
your credit cards,
for any kind of activity.

127
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:00,696
Got an answering machine?

128
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:06,152
Good, keep it on.
Your wife might try to contact you.

129
00:13:06,452 --> 00:13:08,615
Feel free to call me...

130
00:13:09,442 --> 00:13:11,445
if anything comes up.

131
00:13:39,786 --> 00:13:41,352
Dad?

132
00:13:44,087 --> 00:13:46,222
Your mother never loved me.

133
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,765
<i>I didn't know what to say,
because I couldn't remember my mother</i>

134
00:13:52,865 --> 00:13:56,268
<i>ever looking at my dad
with anything but contempt.</i>

135
00:13:56,469 --> 00:14:01,073
<i>Maybe a zillion eons ago when
they were young, it was different.</i>

136
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:09,913
It's perfect, right?

137
00:14:12,116 --> 00:14:14,287
It's everything I've ever wanted.

138
00:14:14,487 --> 00:14:16,889
<i>She was tall, stunning,</i>

139
00:14:16,989 --> 00:14:18,991
<i>like a movie star.</i>

140
00:14:19,091 --> 00:14:21,728
<i>They were the quintessential
American couple,</i>

141
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:25,860
<i>the future unfurling before them
like some endless magic carpet.</i>

142
00:14:26,766 --> 00:14:31,721
<i>If homemaking was an art or science,
my mother would have won a Nobel Prize.</i>

143
00:14:31,821 --> 00:14:35,808
<i>But once the house is immaculate,
and everything was in its place,</i>

144
00:14:35,908 --> 00:14:39,945
<i>she had nothing left to do but plan
the emptiness of days to come.</i>

145
00:14:40,046 --> 00:14:41,486
<i>And gradually,</i>

146
00:14:41,586 --> 00:14:46,447
<i>the beautiful woman she once was
became no more than a phantom,</i>

147
00:14:46,547 --> 00:14:49,452
<i>wandering away in a snowstorm.</i>

148
00:14:51,288 --> 00:14:54,639
- Hello, sweetheart. What's for dinner?
- Meatloaf.

149
00:14:54,739 --> 00:14:57,797
Yum. Your meatloaf is the cat's meow.

150
00:14:58,598 --> 00:15:01,868
So anyway, do you remember that
ticket I bought at the office raffle?

151
00:15:01,968 --> 00:15:04,104
- Not really.
- Well, guess what? I won.

152
00:15:05,004 --> 00:15:08,741
- It's a crock pot.
- We don't need a crock pot.

153
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:11,811
What are you talking about? These are
the latest thing. Everyone's getting one.

154
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:16,115
You can make, stews, pot roast, chilli.

155
00:15:16,215 --> 00:15:20,114
Well, I don't have time to fuss
with it now. I have to finish dinner.

156
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:24,586
Just put it out of the way.
Over there, on top of the fridge.

157
00:15:26,056 --> 00:15:30,158
<i>He was her doormat. She treated
him like shit and he let her.</i>

158
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:34,300
<i>So imagine my shock when I
visited my father at work one day</i>

159
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,836
<i>and discovered he had game.</i>

160
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:41,274
<i>Every woman there was into him.
Flirting with him, batting their eyelashes.</i>

161
00:15:41,874 --> 00:15:45,211
Good morning, Mr. Connors.
And who is this pretty young lady?

162
00:15:45,311 --> 00:15:48,680
Good morning, Mindy.
This is Kat, the new receptionist.

163
00:15:49,781 --> 00:15:54,253
<i>I was stunned. These women
actually thought my dad was hot.</i>

164
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:58,124
<i>But to my mother,
he would always be pathetic.</i>

165
00:15:58,224 --> 00:16:03,163
<i>A constant reminder of the unbearable
repetition and dullness of her life.</i>

166
00:16:04,664 --> 00:16:08,568
<i>My parents' marriage was like a long
drink of water from a frozen fountain.</i>

167
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:11,070
<i>So cold it turns your teeth to diamonds.</i>

168
00:16:12,271 --> 00:16:14,805
<i>It was hardly a surprise to
learn their sex life sucked.</i>

169
00:16:17,457 --> 00:16:18,351
<i>Meanwhile,</i>

170
00:16:19,590 --> 00:16:22,436
<i>my father had his
own drawer of secrets.</i>

171
00:16:28,387 --> 00:16:30,289
<i>So they just went on like that.</i>

172
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:33,960
<i>My mom never coming, my dad
jacking off in the basement,</i>

173
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:36,962
<i>all the while pretending
everything was fine.</i>

174
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:41,599
<i>That we were the perfect family
living this perfect fucking life.</i>

175
00:16:58,751 --> 00:17:00,452
Pass the butter.

176
00:17:08,961 --> 00:17:10,630
Thank you.

177
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:14,000
<i>There were times when I
thought she was going mad,</i>

178
00:17:14,100 --> 00:17:16,936
<i>that she was going to suffocate
my father one night with a pillow,</i>

179
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:19,705
<i>that she was going to burn
the fucking house down.</i>

180
00:17:20,406 --> 00:17:23,608
<i>But instead, she vanished.</i>

181
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:26,178
How does that make you feel?

182
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:28,413
I don't know.

183
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:30,382
You don't know?

184
00:17:31,183 --> 00:17:33,164
Do you miss her?

185
00:17:33,264 --> 00:17:35,294
No. Not really.

186
00:17:35,394 --> 00:17:38,752
<i>My dad made me see a shrink because he
thought I needed to process my feelings</i>

187
00:17:38,852 --> 00:17:43,696
<i>about my mother leaving. Thing is,
I didn't have any feelings.</i>

188
00:17:44,237 --> 00:17:47,166
<i>Dr. Thaler reminds me of an
actress playing a therapist.</i>

189
00:17:47,266 --> 00:17:51,070
<i>And when we have a session,
I feel like an actress playing myself.</i>

190
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:55,501
I act... I have been having
kind of weird dreams lately.

191
00:17:55,601 --> 00:17:59,612
<i>A bad actress. Doing a shitty job.</i>

192
00:17:59,892 --> 00:18:04,579
Like, I'm... I'm driving
through this gnarly snow storm

193
00:18:05,084 --> 00:18:07,607
<i>and I can't see anything,
I mean, there's snow everywhere.</i>

194
00:18:07,707 --> 00:18:10,483
And then out of nowhere,
this figure appears.

195
00:18:10,583 --> 00:18:13,532
I can't, like, make it out
in any detail or anything,

196
00:18:13,632 --> 00:18:15,862
but I just somehow know
that it's my mother.

197
00:18:16,682 --> 00:18:20,032
<i>And I try to swerve, but I can
feel the car hit something.</i>

198
00:18:20,192 --> 00:18:21,787
I get out, and I look all around

199
00:18:21,887 --> 00:18:25,729
<i>but there's nobody, nothing. Just...</i>

200
00:18:25,830 --> 00:18:29,304
<i>snow and blinding whiteness everywhere.</i>

201
00:18:30,382 --> 00:18:32,838
I've been having these dreams
ever since my mom left.

202
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:37,178
That's not unusual, especially given
the trauma of your situation.

203
00:18:37,997 --> 00:18:42,784
However, contrary to popular belief,
dreams don't necessarily mean anything.

204
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:45,846
We all have strange dreams.

205
00:18:45,946 --> 00:18:49,150
But in most cases, it's just your
brain's way of letting off steam

206
00:18:49,250 --> 00:18:51,157
at the end of the day.

207
00:18:51,936 --> 00:18:53,426
Oh.

208
00:18:56,100 --> 00:18:58,354
I'm worried about you, Kat.

209
00:18:58,737 --> 00:19:00,439
What do you mean?

210
00:19:00,820 --> 00:19:03,328
This is too much to
deal with on your own.

211
00:19:03,929 --> 00:19:06,212
Is that shrink you're
seeing helping any?

212
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:09,645
I guess. I've only
been a couple of times.

213
00:19:10,835 --> 00:19:15,639
Yeah, well, my mom said therapy
helped her a lot after my dad left.

214
00:19:22,328 --> 00:19:24,937
I still don't understand how
she could do this to you.

215
00:19:25,037 --> 00:19:29,605
- She wanted out, I guess.
- So? That's no excuse.

216
00:19:31,142 --> 00:19:33,802
Least my dad told us he was leaving.

217
00:19:33,933 --> 00:19:35,853
He didn't just...

218
00:19:36,358 --> 00:19:39,034
leave us in the dark, wondering.

219
00:19:39,345 --> 00:19:43,646
Whatever. Can we just
stop talking and fuck?

220
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:48,004
Gotta get back before my mom freaks out.

221
00:19:48,387 --> 00:19:52,905
- Plus isn't your dad coming home soon?
- No, not for at least an hour.

222
00:19:53,005 --> 00:19:55,868
Yeah, well, last thing I want
is for him to catch us again.

223
00:19:55,968 --> 00:19:58,942
Last time he got so mad I
thought he was gonna kill me.

224
00:20:01,205 --> 00:20:02,835
Just...

225
00:20:03,018 --> 00:20:05,992
- give your shrink a chance, will you?
- All right.

226
00:20:06,092 --> 00:20:09,755
Seriously. You need to let
some of your anger out.

227
00:20:09,855 --> 00:20:13,521
You're gonna crack. Just like your mom.

228
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:16,527
It's like a vicious "circus".

229
00:20:19,555 --> 00:20:21,249
Catch you later.

230
00:20:27,693 --> 00:20:30,686
I don't mean to sound crass,
but if I don't get some dick soon

231
00:20:30,786 --> 00:20:34,727
- I'm going to explode.
- Join the fucking club, sister.

232
00:20:34,827 --> 00:20:37,576
Look on the bright side.
At least you've had real sex.

233
00:20:37,676 --> 00:20:41,374
I'm so paranoid about AIDS I have
to live vicariously through you.

234
00:20:41,474 --> 00:20:43,823
Okay, well, the problem is
that once you've had real sex,

235
00:20:43,923 --> 00:20:46,359
it's, like, all you
can ever think about.

236
00:20:46,459 --> 00:20:50,449
And Phil barely even touches me anymore.
He gives me goodnight peck and that's it.

237
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:52,044
What? That's fucked up.

238
00:20:52,144 --> 00:20:54,587
I know. It's, like,
we're some old married couple.

239
00:20:54,807 --> 00:20:57,236
Maybe you should bang that
hot detective you're so into.

240
00:20:57,336 --> 00:21:00,493
What? What are you talking about?
He's, like, 40.

241
00:21:00,593 --> 00:21:02,368
That's not even legal I don't think.

242
00:21:02,468 --> 00:21:06,819
Kat, he's a cop. If anyone knows how to
do shit without getting caught, he does.

243
00:21:06,919 --> 00:21:09,468
Yeah, plus you'll be 18
in a few weeks anyway.

244
00:21:09,568 --> 00:21:14,787
Okay, whatever. I am not screwing
a 40 year old cop. Okay?

245
00:21:15,367 --> 00:21:17,703
Back to the problem at hand,
getting Phil to fuck me.

246
00:21:18,163 --> 00:21:19,712
Well, have you talked to him about it?

247
00:21:19,812 --> 00:21:24,377
I tried. All he says is that,
he's got a lot on his mind,

248
00:21:24,477 --> 00:21:27,609
and that I need to
cut him some "slacks".

249
00:21:27,709 --> 00:21:31,036
Oh, my God, what a fucking moron!

250
00:21:31,136 --> 00:21:34,033
I know. I know Phil's not the
brightest crayon in the box.

251
00:21:34,133 --> 00:21:37,243
That is the understatement
of the century.

252
00:21:37,343 --> 00:21:39,712
That's what I kind of
like about him, you know?

253
00:21:39,882 --> 00:21:42,501
He's just simple.

254
00:21:43,182 --> 00:21:46,338
I know that sounds perverse,
but he's kind of like my dad in that way.

255
00:21:46,438 --> 00:21:50,705
You can scratch the surface
and there's just more surface.

256
00:21:53,565 --> 00:21:55,768
I'm gonna get straight C's!

257
00:21:58,202 --> 00:22:00,023
Show me.

258
00:22:04,203 --> 00:22:06,931
My God, you're so fuckin' crazy!

259
00:22:10,568 --> 00:22:13,088
<i>Phil is literally the boy next door.</i>

260
00:22:13,188 --> 00:22:17,432
<i>And when he and his mother moved in
last year, I instantly despised him.</i>

261
00:22:18,123 --> 00:22:21,667
<i>He was so dull and stupid.
I made fun of him.</i>

262
00:22:21,767 --> 00:22:25,701
<i>Even earned a
special nickname: Garbage.</i>

263
00:22:27,318 --> 00:22:30,383
<i>But then, one night that summer,</i>

264
00:22:30,483 --> 00:22:32,136
<i>everything changed.</i>

265
00:22:37,700 --> 00:22:41,233
<i>Me, Beth and Mickey, we were
doing what we did every Wednesday.</i>

266
00:22:41,333 --> 00:22:42,876
<i>And even more bored than usual.</i>

267
00:22:43,242 --> 00:22:46,248
Sometimes I wish someone would
burn this place to the ground

268
00:22:46,348 --> 00:22:47,849
so we didn't have to come here anymore.

269
00:22:47,949 --> 00:22:51,369
Oh, tell me about it. Every week
it's the same fucking people

270
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:55,238
with the same fucking songs in
the exact same fucking order.

271
00:22:57,140 --> 00:23:00,352
- Oh, my God.
- What?

272
00:23:00,452 --> 00:23:02,760
Look what the bats dragged in.

273
00:23:03,781 --> 00:23:06,552
What the hell is Garbage doing here?

274
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:10,376
- Oh, shit, he's coming over here.
- Oh, God, what a fucking freak.

275
00:23:10,476 --> 00:23:12,911
Guys, be cool. Come on.

276
00:23:17,303 --> 00:23:18,744
Hey.

277
00:23:19,851 --> 00:23:21,136
Hey.

278
00:23:22,906 --> 00:23:25,374
You live across the street from me.

279
00:23:27,319 --> 00:23:28,300
I'm Phil.

280
00:23:28,980 --> 00:23:30,486
I'm Kat.

281
00:23:32,083 --> 00:23:35,015
This is, Beth and Mickey.

282
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:37,115
Hey.

283
00:23:40,326 --> 00:23:42,654
This place seems cool.

284
00:23:46,957 --> 00:23:48,866
You come here a lot?

285
00:23:49,121 --> 00:23:50,862
Sometimes.

286
00:24:00,065 --> 00:24:02,105
Is this your first time here?

287
00:24:10,582 --> 00:24:12,282
I love this song.

288
00:24:14,111 --> 00:24:15,758
Me too.

289
00:24:21,493 --> 00:24:23,687
Hey, do you wanna dance?

290
00:24:26,069 --> 00:24:27,398
Sure.

291
00:25:40,993 --> 00:25:42,528
Wait, what if your parents come home?

292
00:25:42,628 --> 00:25:44,927
It's my mom's shopping
day and my dad's at work.

293
00:26:01,180 --> 00:26:02,792
You sure?

294
00:26:05,166 --> 00:26:06,022
Yeah.

295
00:26:16,043 --> 00:26:19,744
- Sorry. Oops.
- Okay.

296
00:26:28,200 --> 00:26:30,764
- You okay?
- Yeah.

297
00:26:31,676 --> 00:26:34,351
- Okay.
- Oh, God.

298
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:37,071
<i>And like that, in a blink,</i>

299
00:26:37,171 --> 00:26:39,589
<i>my virginity disappeared.</i>

300
00:26:40,566 --> 00:26:42,467
<i>Just like my mother.</i>

301
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:49,173
Hold on. I'm coming.

302
00:26:57,402 --> 00:27:01,239
Good afternoon, Mrs. Hillman.
It's Eve Connors, from next door.

303
00:27:03,460 --> 00:27:04,778
Hello.

304
00:27:04,878 --> 00:27:06,704
Do you have a moment? May I come in?

305
00:27:06,804 --> 00:27:10,696
Yes, of... of course.
Is... is everything all right?

306
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:14,429
Everything's fine. I just thought
we should have a little chat.

307
00:27:16,167 --> 00:27:19,033
Oh, please, sit.

308
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:25,037
Can I get you a cup of tea,
or coffee, Mrs. Connors?

309
00:27:25,137 --> 00:27:29,165
No, no thank you.
And please, call me Eve.

310
00:27:30,988 --> 00:27:32,648
So...

311
00:27:33,592 --> 00:27:37,181
what can I help you with, Eve?

312
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:40,098
Well, it seems my daughter
Kat and your son are dating.

313
00:27:40,198 --> 00:27:45,224
I know. They're going to some
big fancy dance next week.

314
00:27:45,324 --> 00:27:48,320
- Fall formal.
- The... that's... that's it.

315
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:51,156
Phil is, he's so excited.

316
00:27:51,256 --> 00:27:53,459
I thought it might be a good
idea for us to get acquainted,

317
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:57,368
so I wanted to introduce myself, and...

318
00:27:58,717 --> 00:28:00,305
Phil?

319
00:28:00,405 --> 00:28:01,980
Sorry, I didn't know anyone was here.

320
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:05,751
Phil, this is Kat's mother, Mrs. Connors.

321
00:28:05,851 --> 00:28:06,673
Hey.

322
00:28:07,726 --> 00:28:11,375
She just... came by to say hello.

323
00:28:12,726 --> 00:28:14,175
Okay.

324
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:18,209
Well, I'm just gonna head to my room.

325
00:28:25,938 --> 00:28:27,840
He's a nice boy.

326
00:28:27,940 --> 00:28:32,770
You can rest assured, Eve, that my Phil
will take good care of your daughter.

327
00:28:33,231 --> 00:28:36,992
He's rented a tux, and everything.

328
00:28:37,962 --> 00:28:39,482
Yes.

329
00:28:41,313 --> 00:28:45,247
I'm taking Kat to the mall this
afternoon to buy a new dress.

330
00:28:46,950 --> 00:28:49,021
If your mother was so unhappy,

331
00:28:49,121 --> 00:28:52,029
why do you think she married
your father in the first place?

332
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:55,386
God, I have no idea.

333
00:28:56,927 --> 00:29:01,173
Because he was there?
I mean, he wanted to marry her.

334
00:29:02,394 --> 00:29:04,750
She had no other choice, maybe?

335
00:29:04,850 --> 00:29:07,286
I mean, she went to college,
and she was working as a receptionist,

336
00:29:07,386 --> 00:29:10,481
but what else was she gonna do?

337
00:29:14,506 --> 00:29:18,687
I guess life with my father must have
been pretty bleak and miserable for her.

338
00:29:20,756 --> 00:29:24,149
The night before she left I noticed
that she started dressing different.

339
00:29:24,249 --> 00:29:26,698
What do you mean, different?

340
00:29:26,939 --> 00:29:31,236
Like, her clothes got tighter. Sexier.

341
00:29:31,636 --> 00:29:34,079
I mean, she even bought a miniskirt.

342
00:29:34,740 --> 00:29:37,046
Then there was that night that
she walked in on me and Phil.

343
00:29:39,002 --> 00:29:40,815
I think it's time for Phil to go home.

344
00:29:41,259 --> 00:29:43,354
- What? Why?
- It's late.

345
00:29:44,295 --> 00:29:47,949
- It's not even midnight.
- Kat, what I say goes.

346
00:29:48,049 --> 00:29:50,621
And I say go to bed.

347
00:29:51,402 --> 00:29:53,467
The weirdest part was that
she had on this nightgown

348
00:29:53,567 --> 00:29:58,095
that was practically see-through. It was
almost like she was putting on a show.

349
00:29:58,376 --> 00:30:00,472
Could it be that's what she was doing?

350
00:30:00,572 --> 00:30:03,000
What? Putting on a show?

351
00:30:04,021 --> 00:30:06,102
For me, or for Phil?

352
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:09,352
No.

353
00:30:09,855 --> 00:30:12,243
I think she was just bored.

354
00:30:12,344 --> 00:30:16,980
And getting older, and trying to
get whatever attention she could.

355
00:30:19,718 --> 00:30:22,552
It was almost like she wanted
to have an affair or something.

356
00:30:25,314 --> 00:30:28,036
Do you think that's what was going on?

357
00:30:28,433 --> 00:30:31,129
No. I mean, I can't imagine it.

358
00:30:31,229 --> 00:30:34,829
But, I guess anything's possible, right?

359
00:30:35,327 --> 00:30:37,306
Oh. Sorry.

360
00:30:39,315 --> 00:30:41,740
I tried knocking but
there was no answer.

361
00:30:41,840 --> 00:30:45,686
That's all right.
Can I help you with something?

362
00:30:45,977 --> 00:30:48,510
I'm just looking for
my mom's stupid cat.

363
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:51,608
You seen him?

364
00:30:52,329 --> 00:30:54,203
Can't say that I have.

365
00:30:55,940 --> 00:30:59,331
Okay. Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Connors.

366
00:30:59,431 --> 00:31:04,065
Mrs. Connors sounds so formal.
Call me Eve.

367
00:31:06,401 --> 00:31:07,212
All right.

368
00:31:07,312 --> 00:31:11,227
You know, the time when I was your
age doesn't seem so far away to me.

369
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:15,656
Well,

370
00:31:15,756 --> 00:31:18,484
I should probably look for my mom's cat.

371
00:31:20,289 --> 00:31:23,715
Phil, would you like to
have dinner with us tonight?

372
00:31:23,815 --> 00:31:26,169
I'm making crab thermador.

373
00:31:29,582 --> 00:31:31,099
Sure.

374
00:31:32,022 --> 00:31:34,226
Dinner is at seven.

375
00:31:34,326 --> 00:31:38,227
Cool. Thanks, Mrs. Connor. I mean...

376
00:31:39,630 --> 00:31:41,139
Eve.

377
00:31:58,963 --> 00:32:01,006
<i>Yeah, you've reached
Detective Theo Scieziesciez.</i>

378
00:32:01,106 --> 00:32:03,487
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

379
00:32:04,616 --> 00:32:08,387
Hi. Detective. It's... it's Kat Connors.

380
00:32:08,487 --> 00:32:13,534
I'm just... I'm just calling because
I think I might have some information

381
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:16,567
about my mother.

382
00:33:02,221 --> 00:33:03,636
Hey.

383
00:33:04,141 --> 00:33:05,891
Thanks again for meeting me here.

384
00:33:05,991 --> 00:33:08,980
Couldn't bear the thought of going into
the office on my day off, you know?

385
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:12,009
- No problem.
- Come on in.

386
00:33:12,690 --> 00:33:14,157
Thank you.

387
00:33:17,079 --> 00:33:19,394
It ain't fancy, but it's home.

388
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:23,822
- Can I get you a drink?
- Yeah, sure.

389
00:33:23,922 --> 00:33:26,331
I'd offer you a beer,
but you're not of age.

390
00:33:26,431 --> 00:33:28,593
I'd take one anyway.

391
00:33:28,693 --> 00:33:30,528
All right then.

392
00:33:34,953 --> 00:33:36,567
Sit down.

393
00:33:56,488 --> 00:33:58,569
- Go on.
- Thanks.

394
00:34:02,734 --> 00:34:04,293
So?

395
00:34:05,293 --> 00:34:07,561
What do you want to talk to me about?

396
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:10,457
I...

397
00:34:11,182 --> 00:34:14,815
I called because I have
some new information.

398
00:34:15,126 --> 00:34:17,916
I just remembered some things, and,

399
00:34:18,016 --> 00:34:20,992
I think my mother may
have been having an affair.

400
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:22,419
Oh, yeah?

401
00:34:23,100 --> 00:34:25,761
I mean, it could explain
why she left, right?

402
00:34:27,584 --> 00:34:29,297
Maybe.

403
00:34:29,457 --> 00:34:31,778
I'll look into it on Monday.

404
00:34:31,878 --> 00:34:33,509
Okay.

405
00:34:37,335 --> 00:34:38,950
Is that it?

406
00:34:40,211 --> 00:34:43,847
I just thought that it might be,
like, relative to the case.

407
00:34:50,775 --> 00:34:52,202
Are you nervous?

408
00:34:54,323 --> 00:34:57,424
I guess. A little.

409
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:01,565
Well, you know you can leave
any time you want, right?

410
00:35:02,426 --> 00:35:04,140
I know.

411
00:35:05,321 --> 00:35:09,362
But, you don't want to leave, do you?

412
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:15,177
Because you came here to seduce me.

413
00:35:17,399 --> 00:35:21,721
Well, congratulations, sweetheart.
It worked.

414
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,653
I'm seduced.

415
00:35:27,009 --> 00:35:30,334
- And how old are you?
- Eighteen.

416
00:35:31,135 --> 00:35:34,206
- You're not a virgin, are you?
- No.

417
00:35:36,286 --> 00:35:37,800
So...

418
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:42,306
you know what's about to happen, right?

419
00:35:42,867 --> 00:35:45,709
And are you sure that's what you want?

420
00:35:49,007 --> 00:35:53,358
Because I'm not one of your punk
classmates from school, you know?

421
00:35:53,458 --> 00:35:55,085
I know.

422
00:36:06,531 --> 00:36:09,144
Well, you're hot, that's for sure.

423
00:36:10,514 --> 00:36:13,874
Your tits are perfect.

424
00:36:15,204 --> 00:36:17,998
But you already know that, don't you.

425
00:36:22,901 --> 00:36:25,746
Maybe I should come
over there and join you.

426
00:36:27,269 --> 00:36:28,722
Yeah.

427
00:36:39,784 --> 00:36:41,623
This better?

428
00:36:56,034 --> 00:36:58,882
Why don't you take this top off?

429
00:37:23,054 --> 00:37:24,945
Fucking amazing.

430
00:37:34,125 --> 00:37:37,761
- Is this what you want?
- Yeah.

431
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:02,446
- Hey.
- Hey.

432
00:38:06,551 --> 00:38:08,193
Everything all right?

433
00:38:08,293 --> 00:38:10,988
Yeah. I just don't sleep
so good sometime.

434
00:38:12,329 --> 00:38:14,689
I've seen a lot of bad shit.

435
00:38:15,772 --> 00:38:19,702
Dead people. Very unhappy about it.

436
00:38:20,102 --> 00:38:23,313
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

437
00:38:25,054 --> 00:38:27,539
Trust me, you don't wanna know.

438
00:38:27,639 --> 00:38:29,582
Try me.

439
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:33,615
All right.

440
00:38:36,518 --> 00:38:39,236
Once there was this...

441
00:38:39,591 --> 00:38:42,113
obese man,

442
00:38:44,119 --> 00:38:49,262
some sick fuck had doused him
with gasoline and lit him on fire.

443
00:38:49,928 --> 00:38:54,148
And by the time we got to the body,

444
00:38:54,666 --> 00:38:56,872
two days later,

445
00:38:58,588 --> 00:39:01,772
- he was still burning.
- What?

446
00:39:03,373 --> 00:39:06,420
Guy had so much body fat,

447
00:39:07,324 --> 00:39:09,597
he was like a human candle.

448
00:39:15,266 --> 00:39:18,263
And there's one thing I've learned,

449
00:39:18,363 --> 00:39:21,957
in all my years as a cop,

450
00:39:24,000 --> 00:39:28,714
it's that people are
capable of doing horrible,

451
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:32,936
unimaginable things to each other.

452
00:39:37,675 --> 00:39:40,257
Love how slippery you are.

453
00:39:40,678 --> 00:39:44,649
- Feel like I could break you in half.
- I'm tougher than I look.

454
00:39:44,749 --> 00:39:46,424
- Oh, yeah?
- Oh, yeah.

455
00:39:46,524 --> 00:39:49,359
- Wanna try me?
- Yes.

456
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:52,163
Oh, my God.

457
00:39:52,263 --> 00:39:56,267
- What? It was easy.
- What do you mean it was easy?

458
00:39:56,367 --> 00:39:59,136
I mean I went over
there and I fucked him.

459
00:40:00,972 --> 00:40:05,330
I'm impressed. Truly, truly impressed.
So was it hot?

460
00:40:05,430 --> 00:40:08,680
Oh, hell yes. Like,
so much better than Phil.

461
00:40:08,780 --> 00:40:12,243
- Deets, girl, deets.
- He's just, like, so manly.

462
00:40:12,343 --> 00:40:16,728
Like, cock, and balls, and, like,
hairy chest, and muscles, and,

463
00:40:16,828 --> 00:40:20,421
like, the way he smells, Beth,
is so intense. It's, like, primal.

464
00:40:21,865 --> 00:40:25,884
- Oh, I can still smell him on me now.
- I'mma have me some.

465
00:40:25,984 --> 00:40:28,493
Oh, God, that's so hot.

466
00:40:28,593 --> 00:40:32,290
One day I hope some musky macho
stud will fuck the shit out of me too.

467
00:40:32,390 --> 00:40:36,861
- Oh, it'll happen.
- Oh, yeah. When? When?

468
00:40:36,961 --> 00:40:39,303
I'm so proud of you.

469
00:40:39,504 --> 00:40:42,507
Why? Because I fucked an old guy?

470
00:40:42,607 --> 00:40:46,544
Yeah. I mean, don't take
this the wrong way, Kat,

471
00:40:46,644 --> 00:40:49,794
but for the longest time you were
acting like you were still fat.

472
00:40:49,894 --> 00:40:51,549
Oh, my God. What are you talking about?

473
00:40:51,649 --> 00:40:56,047
I mean, you lost all of that weight,
like, what, three years ago?

474
00:40:56,147 --> 00:40:59,043
But you're still skulking around
all angsty and awkward.

475
00:40:59,143 --> 00:41:02,233
Like a fat chick. Like me.

476
00:41:02,333 --> 00:41:06,759
And Mickey, who's basically a
fat chick in a skinny gay body.

477
00:41:07,785 --> 00:41:10,055
- You're crazy.
- It's true.

478
00:41:11,789 --> 00:41:14,899
<i>Mr.Connor, this is Sheryl from
the Loma Linda Police Department.</i>

479
00:41:14,999 --> 00:41:18,670
<i>I'm pleased to inform you that
you passed your lie detector test.</i>

480
00:41:18,770 --> 00:41:22,169
<i>Thank you for your cooperation,
and have a nice day.</i>

481
00:41:25,062 --> 00:41:27,525
Why would your dad need
to take a lie detector test?

482
00:41:27,625 --> 00:41:29,594
I have no idea.

483
00:41:29,694 --> 00:41:32,143
Well, do you think the cops
think he knows something?

484
00:41:32,243 --> 00:41:35,173
My dad? Beth, have you met him?

485
00:41:35,273 --> 00:41:38,529
You look up clueless in the dictionary
and there's a picture of him.

486
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,764
Must be some kind of mistake.

487
00:41:40,865 --> 00:41:42,686
Probably.

488
00:41:44,387 --> 00:41:47,405
I think that's his car. Just ask him.

489
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:48,839
Do you want me to leave?

490
00:41:48,939 --> 00:41:52,075
What? No. Whatever.
I'm sure it's nothing.

491
00:41:55,025 --> 00:41:56,666
Hi, sweetheart, Beth.

492
00:41:57,567 --> 00:42:00,038
Kids didn't spend too much
money at the mall, I hope?

493
00:42:00,138 --> 00:42:03,087
Nope. I just picked up a few things.

494
00:42:04,830 --> 00:42:07,225
Hey, dad, there was a...
message for you,

495
00:42:07,325 --> 00:42:11,259
on the machine,
from the police department.

496
00:42:12,463 --> 00:42:14,172
Is there news about your mother?

497
00:42:14,559 --> 00:42:18,889
No. They said that you passed
the lie detector test?

498
00:42:19,863 --> 00:42:23,601
Well, whoop-dee-do. So, you going
to join us for dinner, Beth?

499
00:42:23,701 --> 00:42:26,612
I... I don't think so, Mr. Connors.

500
00:42:27,665 --> 00:42:29,734
Dad, why would they want you
to take a lie detector test?

501
00:42:29,834 --> 00:42:33,582
Beats me. It's standard procedure
in cases like this, I guess.

502
00:42:35,717 --> 00:42:37,819
So what are you feeling, sweetheart?

503
00:42:38,409 --> 00:42:40,885
Should we order takeout
from that rib place?

504
00:42:40,985 --> 00:42:42,893
Yeah, sure.

505
00:42:53,931 --> 00:42:55,689
Mom?

506
00:42:57,973 --> 00:43:00,674
What is it? What's going on?

507
00:43:02,158 --> 00:43:04,232
Is Phil a good fuck?

508
00:43:06,028 --> 00:43:07,972
Go to bed, mom.

509
00:43:08,072 --> 00:43:12,490
- Don't you turn your back on me!
- Seriously, just go back to bed.

510
00:43:12,590 --> 00:43:16,953
I will not be dismissed by
the likes of you. Answer me!

511
00:43:17,173 --> 00:43:19,362
Is Phil a good fuck?

512
00:43:20,543 --> 00:43:23,071
What would you know
about fucking, anyway?

513
00:43:24,407 --> 00:43:27,965
- Oh, my... what are you doing?
- What is this?

514
00:43:28,065 --> 00:43:29,554
- Mom, what are you...
- Why are you naked?

515
00:43:29,654 --> 00:43:33,164
I was hot! Jesus! Get out of my room!

516
00:43:33,264 --> 00:43:37,652
Why are you doing this?
What did I ever do to you? Stop!

517
00:43:39,462 --> 00:43:42,476
I do too know what a good fuck is.

518
00:43:43,453 --> 00:43:45,740
You little slut.

519
00:43:47,383 --> 00:43:50,024
What is your problem?

520
00:43:50,761 --> 00:43:55,632
Are you insane?
What is fucking wrong with you?

521
00:44:03,100 --> 00:44:06,081
What kind of mother would
do something like that?

522
00:44:08,443 --> 00:44:10,471
My mother.

523
00:44:11,981 --> 00:44:13,326
What?

524
00:44:14,531 --> 00:44:16,181
What? That's just how she was.

525
00:44:16,581 --> 00:44:20,397
I mean, everyone has a crappy childhood.
It's not like she beat me.

526
00:44:21,138 --> 00:44:24,943
So my mom wasn't Hallmark
Card perfect. So fucking what?

527
00:44:28,573 --> 00:44:30,821
I just think she was lonely.

528
00:44:34,165 --> 00:44:36,454
I used to catch her staring at me,

529
00:44:36,554 --> 00:44:40,233
like I was wearing something
that I had stolen from her.

530
00:44:42,758 --> 00:44:46,817
- You look like I looked when I was you.
- What?

531
00:44:46,918 --> 00:44:51,124
I mean, you look like I looked
when I was your age.

532
00:44:51,528 --> 00:44:53,662
Whatever, lurker.

533
00:44:55,924 --> 00:44:58,492
What? What do you want?

534
00:45:00,116 --> 00:45:01,782
Nothing.

535
00:45:02,400 --> 00:45:06,232
Oh, my God, stop gawking at me.
You're creeping me out.

536
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:10,126
Just, like, get out of here.
Just leave me alone.

537
00:45:17,882 --> 00:45:21,245
About a week before she disappeared,

538
00:45:21,345 --> 00:45:25,159
Phil and I were in the
basement doing homework,

539
00:45:26,422 --> 00:45:28,371
just like any other ordinary night.

540
00:45:32,436 --> 00:45:35,212
Well, what do you think? You like?

541
00:45:35,372 --> 00:45:38,148
Pretty sexy for 42?

542
00:45:38,249 --> 00:45:42,519
- Mom, what are you doing?
- Oh, loosen up, Miss Prissypants.

543
00:45:43,140 --> 00:45:44,919
Phil.

544
00:45:45,686 --> 00:45:47,990
Why don't you and your
mother join us for dinner?

545
00:45:48,090 --> 00:45:51,415
I'm making my world-famous
Beef Wellington.

546
00:45:52,491 --> 00:45:56,985
- Yeah, o... okay, Mrs. Connors. I'll ask.
- Splendid.

547
00:45:59,161 --> 00:46:01,622
I'm in the mood to celebrating.

548
00:46:03,852 --> 00:46:07,632
- Okay, mom, whatever. We get it already.
- Oh, what's the matter, Kat?

549
00:46:07,912 --> 00:46:12,338
Can't stand seeing your mother
have a little fun for a change?

550
00:46:12,443 --> 00:46:14,917
Honey, I'm home!

551
00:46:16,291 --> 00:46:19,090
And the party is over
before it's even begun.

552
00:46:19,190 --> 00:46:22,031
Sweetheart, where are you?
There you are.

553
00:46:22,911 --> 00:46:24,868
What's for dinner?

554
00:46:26,928 --> 00:46:29,347
What's going on?
Why are you dressed like that?

555
00:46:29,447 --> 00:46:32,864
- What? You don't like it?
- No. I don't.

556
00:46:32,964 --> 00:46:35,980
Well, tough shit.
You don't like this skirt?

557
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,015
- Eve, stop it.
- I don't care.

558
00:46:38,115 --> 00:46:40,787
You don't like this skirt and I don't care.
You don't like this skirt and I don't...

559
00:46:40,887 --> 00:46:43,935
Get your goddamned hands off me!

560
00:46:44,335 --> 00:46:46,757
I'll wear whatever the hell I want.

561
00:46:46,857 --> 00:46:49,254
Whenever I want to!

562
00:46:49,954 --> 00:46:51,496
What are you doing?

563
00:46:51,596 --> 00:46:57,080
What I do every fucking night of my
fucking life, making your fucking dinner.

564
00:47:00,111 --> 00:47:03,654
- Oh, Jesus!
- Oh, shit! What reeks?

565
00:47:04,280 --> 00:47:07,331
- The meat. It's all rotten.
- Must have come unplugged.

566
00:47:07,431 --> 00:47:11,801
- Don't just stand there, plug it back in!
- Smells like a fucking dead body in here!

567
00:47:21,719 --> 00:47:24,639
Well, looks like we're
going out for dinner tonight.

568
00:47:25,543 --> 00:47:27,564
Wanna get Chinese?

569
00:47:27,665 --> 00:47:32,212
No. I don't want fucking Chinese.

570
00:47:33,375 --> 00:47:37,383
Okay, then, what would make you happy,
Evie? What do you want?

571
00:47:38,781 --> 00:47:41,088
I don't want this.

572
00:47:41,505 --> 00:47:44,101
I don't want any of it.

573
00:47:44,522 --> 00:47:46,224
You,

574
00:47:46,981 --> 00:47:49,766
- this house.
- Evie.

575
00:47:49,867 --> 00:47:52,964
I want my fucking life back.

576
00:47:55,510 --> 00:47:57,635
Come on, sweetheart. Let's go to dinner.

577
00:47:57,735 --> 00:48:01,050
I don't want fucking dinner!

578
00:48:01,285 --> 00:48:05,148
Why won't anyone listen to me?

579
00:48:36,113 --> 00:48:39,826
So out of the blue she
was just, like, poof?

580
00:48:40,638 --> 00:48:42,152
Pretty much.

581
00:48:43,134 --> 00:48:44,643
Wow.

582
00:48:45,423 --> 00:48:48,579
You told me your mom left,
but not like that.

583
00:48:48,679 --> 00:48:52,096
Well, we've been roommates
for almost a year, so.

584
00:48:52,997 --> 00:48:55,466
But don't you wonder where she is?
I mean, she's gotta be somewhere, right?

585
00:48:56,286 --> 00:49:00,191
I don't know, it's weird.
Hardly even think about her anymore.

586
00:49:00,291 --> 00:49:04,984
You know, it's, like, so much time has
passed, that kinda just gotten used to it.

587
00:49:06,235 --> 00:49:11,461
Guess going home next week for break has
kinda resurrected the ghost from my past.

588
00:49:11,922 --> 00:49:15,212
Speaking of ghosts, you're not gonna
go see that loser boyfriend of yours,

589
00:49:15,312 --> 00:49:17,979
- what's-his-name, are you?
- You mean Phil?

590
00:49:19,855 --> 00:49:22,323
Maybe. Why?

591
00:49:22,900 --> 00:49:25,082
Well, you know I'm team Oliver.

592
00:49:25,182 --> 00:49:27,338
We've only been dating
for a couple of months.

593
00:49:27,438 --> 00:49:29,967
So? That's enough to know
that he's hot, and smart,

594
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:33,037
and actually has a future,
unlike what's-his-name.

595
00:49:33,377 --> 00:49:36,107
Cindy, you met Phil once, for a weekend.

596
00:49:36,207 --> 00:49:38,648
Yeah, that was enough.

597
00:49:39,289 --> 00:49:41,202
Whatever.

598
00:49:41,302 --> 00:49:43,772
The future bores me.

599
00:49:44,386 --> 00:49:46,891
What's going on with you tonight?
Is everything okay?

600
00:49:46,991 --> 00:49:49,286
Yeah, why?

601
00:49:49,386 --> 00:49:51,988
I don't know, you seem
a million miles away.

602
00:49:52,089 --> 00:49:56,323
Sorry. Just a little preoccupied.

603
00:49:56,814 --> 00:49:58,528
I'm fine.

604
00:50:01,932 --> 00:50:03,522
What?

605
00:50:04,847 --> 00:50:06,512
Nothing.

606
00:50:07,304 --> 00:50:09,819
Don't say nothing when it's something.

607
00:50:10,220 --> 00:50:11,875
Okay, you know I don't
like it when you smoke.

608
00:50:11,975 --> 00:50:13,838
It's bad for you,
especially since you're on the pill.

609
00:50:13,938 --> 00:50:17,635
Yeah, well, this is only my second one today.
I'm cutting back, just for you.

610
00:50:17,735 --> 00:50:21,718
Don't cut back for me. Okay?
It's your health we're talking about.

611
00:50:25,990 --> 00:50:27,824
Okay, doctor.

612
00:50:29,385 --> 00:50:31,055
Are you satisfied?

613
00:50:31,155 --> 00:50:34,839
- Not if you're gonna be mad.
- Why would I be mad?

614
00:50:34,939 --> 00:50:36,988
Just because you're
telling me what to do?

615
00:50:37,088 --> 00:50:39,176
I mean, I can't smoke in my room
because Cindy says it stinks,

616
00:50:39,276 --> 00:50:41,299
and I can't smoke around you
because you say it's unhealthy.

617
00:50:41,399 --> 00:50:44,333
Kat, it's not like you're addicted to nicotine.
You've been smoking for two months.

618
00:50:44,433 --> 00:50:47,625
Okay, well, whatever. I just want
to be free to do what I want.

619
00:50:47,725 --> 00:50:51,781
Okay, find, go ahead and smoke.
I don't want to fight.

620
00:50:56,954 --> 00:51:01,057
Look, I'm sorry, okay?
I just... I want you to be happy.

621
00:51:02,818 --> 00:51:05,716
- I think I'm just gonna head home.
- Wait. What?

622
00:51:05,816 --> 00:51:07,872
I'm going. I have studying to do.

623
00:51:07,972 --> 00:51:10,381
Kat, come on. What are...
what are you doing? Just stay.

624
00:51:10,481 --> 00:51:12,202
Goodnight, Oliver.

625
00:51:14,703 --> 00:51:18,346
Oh, my God, what is the matter with you?
Seriously? What did I do?

626
00:51:18,446 --> 00:51:19,958
Kat?

627
00:51:20,619 --> 00:51:22,131
Kat!

628
00:51:33,483 --> 00:51:38,883
<i>I've been looking so long
at these pictures of you</i>

629
00:51:38,983 --> 00:51:44,427
<i>That I almost believe that they're real</i>

630
00:51:44,527 --> 00:51:50,021
<i>I've been living so long
with my pictures of you</i>

631
00:51:50,121 --> 00:51:54,511
<i>That I almost believe that the pictures</i>

632
00:51:54,611 --> 00:51:56,980
<i>Are all I can feel...</i>

633
00:51:57,080 --> 00:51:59,182
Hey! Hi, dad.

634
00:52:01,317 --> 00:52:04,395
- What?
- I can't believe how grown up you look.

635
00:52:04,495 --> 00:52:07,571
Oh, God. Can we forego
the theatrics, please?

636
00:52:07,671 --> 00:52:10,154
Whatever. Act as jaded as you want,

637
00:52:10,254 --> 00:52:13,431
I missed my little girl and
I'm not ashamed to say so.

638
00:52:13,664 --> 00:52:15,733
So how is Berkeley?
Thanks for all the letters, by the way.

639
00:52:15,833 --> 00:52:18,342
- Oh, sorry. Been studying my ass off.
- I know, I know.

640
00:52:18,442 --> 00:52:21,970
You're a big city girl now.
No time for your poor old dad.

641
00:52:24,305 --> 00:52:26,707
I'm glad you're home, sweetheart.

642
00:52:27,277 --> 00:52:29,418
Yeah.

643
00:52:32,105 --> 00:52:36,024
- Sh... should we?
- Yes. No, I got it. I got it.

644
00:52:36,453 --> 00:52:38,155
- Thank you.
- Here.

645
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:40,090
So, anything new and
exciting around here?

646
00:52:40,190 --> 00:52:43,790
Oh, not really. Pretty much
the same old, same old.

647
00:52:44,395 --> 00:52:45,828
What?

648
00:52:47,429 --> 00:52:48,830
Dad?

649
00:52:50,832 --> 00:52:52,836
Dad, what is it?
Why are you acting all weird?

650
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:55,254
Well, I do have a bit of news.

651
00:52:55,805 --> 00:52:57,174
Is everything okay?

652
00:52:57,274 --> 00:53:01,028
- Everything's fine. I just...
- Oh, my God, just spit it out already.

653
00:53:02,563 --> 00:53:05,112
I've been seeing someone.

654
00:53:06,382 --> 00:53:09,149
- Really?
- Yes. Does it make you angry?

655
00:53:09,353 --> 00:53:10,566
What? Are you kidding me?

656
00:53:10,666 --> 00:53:13,990
No, dad, mom's been gone a long time.
Why shouldn't you see other women?

657
00:53:15,824 --> 00:53:17,780
Well, good.

658
00:53:18,061 --> 00:53:20,511
- So, what's her name?
- May.

659
00:53:20,611 --> 00:53:23,933
- May?
- She's a sales rep I met at the office.

660
00:53:24,834 --> 00:53:28,806
Dad, that's so great.
Seriously, I'm really happy for you.

661
00:53:29,056 --> 00:53:31,155
Thank you, sweetheart.
That means a lot to me.

662
00:53:33,258 --> 00:53:35,479
So, what are your plans
while you're at home?

663
00:53:36,555 --> 00:53:41,501
I have some studying to do,
but mostly I just wanna relax.

664
00:53:41,602 --> 00:53:45,555
See some old friends.
You know, the usual.

665
00:53:50,377 --> 00:53:52,059
Welcome back, stranger.

666
00:53:54,195 --> 00:53:58,367
- Such a fucking rebel.
- Kat, you're my new idol.

667
00:53:59,668 --> 00:54:02,089
Oh, my God I've missed you guys.

668
00:54:02,189 --> 00:54:05,709
I mean, my friends at Berkley are nice
and everything, but just kind of boring.

669
00:54:05,809 --> 00:54:08,162
Oh, I missed you too.

670
00:54:08,262 --> 00:54:11,381
What I haven't missed is this
shitty little pisshole of a town.

671
00:54:11,481 --> 00:54:14,234
Oh, my God, my mom told me
to clean my room this morning.

672
00:54:14,334 --> 00:54:17,440
- I almost bludgeoned her to death.
- I can't believe we ever lived here.

673
00:54:17,690 --> 00:54:19,223
Oh, I know.

674
00:54:19,323 --> 00:54:22,609
Though I kind of find it reassuring how
this place never changes. You know?

675
00:54:22,709 --> 00:54:25,295
It's like it's frozen in time.

676
00:54:28,248 --> 00:54:30,600
And you think you've changed?

677
00:54:30,951 --> 00:54:36,005
Oh, yeah. I'd say so. I mean, I definitely
feel more comfortable in my own skin.

678
00:54:36,106 --> 00:54:38,138
School's going well?

679
00:54:39,708 --> 00:54:43,364
And I assume you haven't
heard from your mother.

680
00:54:43,464 --> 00:54:45,482
Nope. Not a word.

681
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:49,184
How are you feeling about that?
It's been over two years.

682
00:54:50,235 --> 00:54:53,474
I don't know. It's kind of
gotten to the point where

683
00:54:53,574 --> 00:54:56,510
I just don't even expect
to hear from her anymore.

684
00:54:56,610 --> 00:55:00,926
I've just come to this weird
sort of acceptance of it.

685
00:55:01,164 --> 00:55:06,451
Guess I've just moved on. I mean,
even my dad has himself a new girlfriend.

686
00:55:07,037 --> 00:55:09,539
Does that bother you at all?

687
00:55:10,504 --> 00:55:12,275
Why should it?

688
00:55:12,376 --> 00:55:15,611
My mother's gone.
She's never coming back.

689
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,961
Hey.

690
00:55:35,346 --> 00:55:36,700
Hey.

691
00:55:36,800 --> 00:55:38,704
How're you doing?

692
00:55:39,247 --> 00:55:41,054
You look great.

693
00:55:41,937 --> 00:55:44,788
Thank you. You too.

694
00:55:46,775 --> 00:55:49,980
Hey, Aaron, okay if I
grab a smoke break?

695
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:53,380
Make it quick. We got a
fuckload of work to do.

696
00:55:54,183 --> 00:55:55,683
Come on.

697
00:55:58,989 --> 00:56:00,941
So school's going good?

698
00:56:01,041 --> 00:56:04,658
It's all right. How about you?
How've you been?

699
00:56:06,161 --> 00:56:10,200
You know. Work, taking care of my mom.

700
00:56:10,300 --> 00:56:12,685
Same old, same old.

701
00:56:12,936 --> 00:56:14,136
How is she?

702
00:56:14,236 --> 00:56:16,473
- My mom?
- Yeah.

703
00:56:17,124 --> 00:56:19,075
Batshit crazy as ever.

704
00:56:25,983 --> 00:56:27,683
Can I have one?

705
00:56:29,084 --> 00:56:30,722
Sure.

706
00:56:31,705 --> 00:56:36,358
- You're smoking now?
- Sometimes. Thanks.

707
00:56:46,536 --> 00:56:48,471
When'd you get back into town?

708
00:56:50,044 --> 00:56:51,775
Couple of days ago.

709
00:56:51,875 --> 00:56:56,906
I'm sorry... I would have called sooner.
Just been really busy, and...

710
00:56:57,930 --> 00:57:00,680
Whatever. It's cool.

711
00:57:06,006 --> 00:57:09,493
But... we should, we should
hang out while I'm here.

712
00:57:09,593 --> 00:57:11,861
Catch a movie or something?

713
00:57:12,062 --> 00:57:14,595
Yeah. Sounds good.

714
00:57:16,265 --> 00:57:18,032
Here 'til Thursday.

715
00:57:18,969 --> 00:57:19,952
Cool.

716
00:57:28,261 --> 00:57:31,477
You don't have to, you know.

717
00:57:31,965 --> 00:57:33,835
Have to what?

718
00:57:35,283 --> 00:57:37,149
See me.

719
00:57:37,537 --> 00:57:39,156
I mean...

720
00:57:39,256 --> 00:57:41,456
I know you might not have
time for an asshole like me,

721
00:57:41,556 --> 00:57:43,030
now that you're a hot
shit college student.

722
00:57:44,928 --> 00:57:46,381
Phil...

723
00:57:47,014 --> 00:57:49,838
What are you talking about?
Of course I want to see you.

724
00:57:50,384 --> 00:57:52,101
Right, whatever.

725
00:57:55,322 --> 00:57:58,258
I better get back to work
before my boss has a cow.

726
00:57:58,358 --> 00:57:59,775
Yeah.

727
00:58:11,287 --> 00:58:15,392
I am so sorry that I'm late.
Traffic was ridiculous.

728
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:17,944
No problem, sweetheart.

729
00:58:18,295 --> 00:58:21,114
Kat, this is May. May, Kat.

730
00:58:21,214 --> 00:58:23,233
I'm so happy we finally
get the chance to meet.

731
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:26,737
- I've heard so much about you.
- Oh, me too.

732
00:58:28,088 --> 00:58:31,124
And you're even lovelier
than your father described.

733
00:58:31,224 --> 00:58:33,727
I'm sure that's not true,
but thank you anyway.

734
00:58:33,877 --> 00:58:36,096
So how long will you
be in town, Katrina?

735
00:58:36,346 --> 00:58:39,900
Oh, just a week.
Then it's back to the salt mines.

736
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:44,354
- Kat got almost all "A" s her first semester.
- Wow, congratulations.

737
00:58:44,454 --> 00:58:48,225
Yeah. I lucked out. Have you
guys ordered yet? I'm starved.

738
00:58:48,325 --> 00:58:50,772
Your favourite, the spinach artichoke
appetiser. It's already on its way.

739
00:58:50,872 --> 00:58:52,279
Oh, yes.

740
00:58:52,379 --> 00:58:55,671
I'm going to make a quick trip to
the ladies room. If the waiter comes,

741
00:58:55,771 --> 00:58:58,550
- you know what I want.
- Right, okay.

742
00:59:06,993 --> 00:59:08,518
So...

743
00:59:09,084 --> 00:59:13,650
- Are you all right with this?
- What? You mean May?

744
00:59:14,101 --> 00:59:17,054
Yeah, Dad I like her. She seems sweet.

745
00:59:17,254 --> 00:59:19,156
I just don't want it
to be awkward for you.

746
00:59:19,256 --> 00:59:21,892
Dad, I told you I am thrilled
that you met someone.

747
00:59:21,992 --> 00:59:24,593
Seriously, you deserve to be happy.

748
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:32,053
Took off your wedding ring.

749
00:59:35,172 --> 00:59:38,258
It makes May uncomfortable.

750
00:59:38,358 --> 00:59:41,100
I put it back on when she's not around.

751
00:59:41,411 --> 00:59:44,120
Why bother? I mean, mom left us.

752
00:59:44,220 --> 00:59:47,633
She's the one who made that choice.
I accept that now.

753
00:59:48,483 --> 00:59:51,593
It's about time we
get on with our lives.

754
01:00:03,934 --> 01:00:05,434
Mom?

755
01:00:09,022 --> 01:00:10,727
Kat.

756
01:00:10,827 --> 01:00:12,758
What is it? What's wrong?

757
01:00:13,709 --> 01:00:18,161
I put my hands in the water,
and they disappeared.

758
01:00:18,964 --> 01:00:20,502
What?

759
01:00:22,417 --> 01:00:27,318
I was doing the dishes
and the water was so cold.

760
01:00:27,907 --> 01:00:31,404
There was a spoon at the
bottom of the sink, and...

761
01:00:31,504 --> 01:00:35,497
when I lifted my hands out of the water...

762
01:00:48,128 --> 01:00:49,984
What's the matter?

763
01:00:50,190 --> 01:00:51,956
Nothing.

764
01:00:53,865 --> 01:00:56,928
Just have strange dreams sometimes.

765
01:00:59,020 --> 01:01:00,654
Oh, yeah?

766
01:01:01,574 --> 01:01:03,312
Yeah.

767
01:01:04,893 --> 01:01:07,644
They started after
my mother disappeared.

768
01:01:07,981 --> 01:01:12,783
Used to get them all the time. It's actually
the first one I've had in weeks.

769
01:01:14,086 --> 01:01:16,723
Hardly ever talk about your mother.

770
01:01:16,823 --> 01:01:20,174
There's not much to say. She's gone.

771
01:01:21,976 --> 01:01:24,994
The shrink says dreams are meaningless.

772
01:01:26,614 --> 01:01:28,515
I don't think I agree with that.

773
01:01:31,035 --> 01:01:33,836
What do you think my dreams mean?

774
01:01:43,900 --> 01:01:47,870
- You really want my opinion?
- Of course. Why wouldn't I?

775
01:01:54,027 --> 01:01:56,997
As you know, we did an
exhaustive search for your mother.

776
01:01:57,097 --> 01:02:00,250
Exhaustive? You guys
barely even looked for her.

777
01:02:00,350 --> 01:02:04,087
Actually, a very thorough
investigation was done.

778
01:02:04,187 --> 01:02:06,756
We spent over two years
looking for your mom.

779
01:02:06,956 --> 01:02:10,645
Not a single trace was ever found.

780
01:02:11,672 --> 01:02:13,431
Whatever.

781
01:02:14,763 --> 01:02:16,997
So where do you think she is?

782
01:02:20,503 --> 01:02:22,462
I think she's dead.

783
01:02:25,239 --> 01:02:26,860
What?

784
01:02:27,511 --> 01:02:30,784
Well, you said yourself
she was having an affair,

785
01:02:30,884 --> 01:02:34,393
which we confirmed. With your neighbour,

786
01:02:34,493 --> 01:02:37,254
- Mrs. Blangman?
- Mrs. Hillman.

787
01:02:38,455 --> 01:02:42,771
Whatever. She said...
your mom had a boyfriend.

788
01:02:43,125 --> 01:02:44,123
How would she know?

789
01:02:45,277 --> 01:02:49,098
- She's nosey.
- She can't see.

790
01:02:53,303 --> 01:02:56,139
Wait... whatever. Even if my
mom did have a boyfriend,

791
01:02:56,239 --> 01:03:00,359
doesn't it just make it that much more
likely that she just ran off somewhere?

792
01:03:05,365 --> 01:03:06,955
What?

793
01:03:08,151 --> 01:03:11,134
What? What is it?
What aren't you saying?

794
01:03:12,970 --> 01:03:16,126
We did a thorough background
check on your father.

795
01:03:16,226 --> 01:03:19,318
Several interviewees told us

796
01:03:19,418 --> 01:03:22,899
that he was a pretty
jealous and volatile man.

797
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:25,968
My dad is a fucking wimp.

798
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:28,221
That's why he used
to drive my mom crazy.

799
01:03:28,321 --> 01:03:31,913
- Not according to Bob and Margie Carlsen.
- Who are they?

800
01:03:32,063 --> 01:03:36,479
Your former neighbours. Your parents used
to live next door to them in Riverside.

801
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:39,322
They told us that when
your father suspected

802
01:03:39,422 --> 01:03:42,525
your mother had a thing for Bob Carlsen,

803
01:03:43,325 --> 01:03:47,654
he lit a trash can on fire and
he tossed it onto their patio.

804
01:03:50,074 --> 01:03:52,505
That's ridiculous.

805
01:03:54,512 --> 01:03:59,363
Never even heard of these people,
and that was two decades ago.

806
01:04:01,502 --> 01:04:05,270
Fine, if my dad was so dangerous,
then why didn't you ever arrest him?

807
01:04:06,158 --> 01:04:07,910
No evidence.

808
01:04:08,511 --> 01:04:11,815
We didn't even have sufficient
cause for a search warrant.

809
01:04:11,915 --> 01:04:16,036
Asked for my professional opinion,
and I told you.

810
01:04:16,136 --> 01:04:19,339
Kat, that's just what I think.

811
01:04:19,439 --> 01:04:20,889
Which is?

812
01:04:23,526 --> 01:04:27,460
I think you father caught your mother
fucking her boyfriend and he killed her.

813
01:04:28,863 --> 01:04:31,431
Well, then what did he do with the body?

814
01:04:34,051 --> 01:04:36,269
That's a damn mystery.

815
01:04:49,235 --> 01:04:50,769
Kat.

816
01:04:51,901 --> 01:04:54,841
Come on. Where are you going?

817
01:04:54,941 --> 01:04:57,542
You know what I think, Detective?

818
01:04:58,293 --> 01:05:00,660
I think you're full of shit.

819
01:05:18,098 --> 01:05:20,350
Come on, strong man.
You can do better than that.

820
01:05:21,072 --> 01:05:22,818
What, like this?

821
01:05:23,119 --> 01:05:26,387
No. Harder.

822
01:05:26,990 --> 01:05:29,820
Put those muscles to
good used for a change.

823
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:33,149
That's better. That's it.
Come on, give it a whack.

824
01:05:40,637 --> 01:05:42,350
You're already here?

825
01:05:43,259 --> 01:05:47,043
Yeah. I was just helping
your mom with dinner.

826
01:05:47,143 --> 01:05:49,094
Unlike some people.

827
01:06:05,545 --> 01:06:09,399
Hi, Mrs. Hillman. It's Kat.
I'm sorry, were you in bed?

828
01:06:09,499 --> 01:06:13,002
Oh, oh, no. I... I was just lying down.

829
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:15,872
I... I haven't been feeling well.

830
01:06:16,222 --> 01:06:18,758
Well, I'm sorry to bother you.
But... is Phil here?

831
01:06:18,858 --> 01:06:20,960
No. He isn't.

832
01:06:21,060 --> 01:06:22,833
Do you know where he is?

833
01:06:22,933 --> 01:06:26,427
I'm afraid not. That boy
sometimes goes out gallivanting

834
01:06:26,527 --> 01:06:29,437
'til all hours of the night.

835
01:06:29,786 --> 01:06:32,171
Okay, well, could you please tell him
to call me as soon as he gets home?

836
01:06:32,271 --> 01:06:35,041
- It's kind of important.
- Of course.

837
01:06:35,141 --> 01:06:37,677
Thank you.
Sorry again for bothering you.

838
01:06:37,777 --> 01:06:40,785
Oh, it's... it's no problem.

839
01:06:41,264 --> 01:06:43,765
- Goodnight, dear.
- Good night.

840
01:07:03,803 --> 01:07:05,889
I don't think it's right with her here.

841
01:07:06,089 --> 01:07:10,685
- But if Kat says she's comfortable, I don't...
- I don't care what Kat said.

842
01:07:11,310 --> 01:07:12,776
Dad?

843
01:07:13,146 --> 01:07:14,803
Honey?

844
01:07:16,078 --> 01:07:18,334
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

845
01:07:18,434 --> 01:07:23,855
If you two are arguing over whether or
not May can sleep over, it's totally fine.

846
01:07:23,956 --> 01:07:27,801
- Sweetheart, I don't think...
- No, no, no, dad, seriously. I don't mind.

847
01:07:28,094 --> 01:07:31,196
Well, you're sick, and we have to
get you to the airport tomorrow.

848
01:07:31,647 --> 01:07:34,597
I'm almost better.
My flight's not until the afternoon.

849
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:39,321
You know what, this is my house
and I call the shots around here.

850
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:47,445
Sorry, Kat.

851
01:07:48,147 --> 01:07:51,249
I didn't mean for you
to get dragged into this.

852
01:07:56,972 --> 01:07:59,742
To Phil, may he rest in pieces.

853
01:08:00,432 --> 01:08:02,625
Oh, my God.

854
01:08:03,994 --> 01:08:05,460
No, fuck Phil.

855
01:08:05,560 --> 01:08:09,252
Seriously, fuck him.
The jerk never even called me back.

856
01:08:09,352 --> 01:08:12,121
That's the spirit. Fuck Phil.

857
01:08:12,221 --> 01:08:14,971
Or, rather, don't fuck Phil.
Stop fucking Phil.

858
01:08:15,071 --> 01:08:18,678
Yeah. Fuck that hot stud cop instead.

859
01:08:18,778 --> 01:08:21,744
Done and done.

860
01:08:23,130 --> 01:08:25,485
You know, he said something
kind of weird the other night.

861
01:08:25,585 --> 01:08:30,001
What'd he say? "I'm gonna plough
you 'til you can't walk straight"?

862
01:08:31,291 --> 01:08:32,956
No.

863
01:08:34,241 --> 01:08:35,776
Yeah, it was so...

864
01:08:35,876 --> 01:08:40,949
He said that he thinks
my dad killed my mother.

865
01:08:44,687 --> 01:08:46,288
What?

866
01:08:49,675 --> 01:08:51,126
What?

867
01:08:52,327 --> 01:08:56,833
I... I told you that, Kat. Ages ago.

868
01:08:57,033 --> 01:08:58,433
We both did.

869
01:08:59,184 --> 01:09:00,587
What are you talking about?

870
01:09:00,687 --> 01:09:02,229
It was right after your mom disappeared,

871
01:09:02,329 --> 01:09:05,558
and you just didn't
seem to want to hear it.

872
01:09:05,658 --> 01:09:09,879
Remember? I asked if maybe
your dad had something to hide?

873
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:14,482
You just blew it off. You said he was
too transparent to hide anything.

874
01:09:18,588 --> 01:09:20,856
You guys are fucking crazy.

875
01:09:23,576 --> 01:09:25,979
Yeah. Forget it.

876
01:09:26,079 --> 01:09:28,448
We both watch way too much bad TV.

877
01:09:28,548 --> 01:09:31,098
But that's why you love us, right?

878
01:09:34,558 --> 01:09:37,874
God, there's nothing more disgusting
than warm, flat champagne.

879
01:09:37,974 --> 01:09:39,876
- Here, give me that.
- What?

880
01:09:39,976 --> 01:09:42,095
The bottle, please.

881
01:09:44,761 --> 01:09:48,334
- What are you doing?
- It's a trick I learned at school.

882
01:09:48,434 --> 01:09:50,753
You put the bottle in the
freezer for a few minutes,

883
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:55,168
and it is chilled to perfection.
Come and help me.

884
01:10:04,801 --> 01:10:07,107
- Mickey?
- There's no way that I am moving

885
01:10:07,207 --> 01:10:10,573
a bunch of old, mouldy newspapers.
Fuck that.

886
01:10:10,673 --> 01:10:13,606
Get your skinny gay ass over here.

887
01:10:17,095 --> 01:10:19,013
Get that one.

888
01:10:25,538 --> 01:10:27,323
It's stuck.

889
01:10:27,774 --> 01:10:29,405
What the...

890
01:10:31,475 --> 01:10:34,043
Why would you lock a fucking freezer?

891
01:10:34,764 --> 01:10:37,118
What the hell is going on down here?

892
01:10:37,483 --> 01:10:42,019
Nothing. We're just talking,
and drinking champagne.

893
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:47,193
Well, it's time for
your friends to leave.

894
01:10:47,293 --> 01:10:49,128
What are you talking about?

895
01:10:50,079 --> 01:10:52,165
You heard me, Kat. The party is over.

896
01:10:52,265 --> 01:10:53,996
Are you joking?

897
01:10:54,684 --> 01:10:56,986
Dad, I hate to break it to you,
but I'm a fuckin' adult.

898
01:10:57,086 --> 01:10:59,322
You can't tell me what to do.

899
01:10:59,472 --> 01:11:01,474
When you're under my roof,
you will do as I say.

900
01:11:01,574 --> 01:11:04,661
And I'm saying your friends
need to go home, now.

901
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:08,298
- Oh, my God. What is your problem?
- Cool it. It's... it's okay, Kat.

902
01:11:08,398 --> 01:11:10,566
- Yeah. Don't worry about it.
- No...

903
01:11:10,666 --> 01:11:12,801
Goodnight, Mr. Connors.

904
01:11:13,052 --> 01:11:15,270
Wait, I'll walk you guys out.

905
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:32,703
Thank you for completely humiliating
me in front of my friends.

906
01:11:32,989 --> 01:11:36,123
So fucking glad I'm getting
out of here tomorrow.

907
01:11:40,520 --> 01:11:42,932
Sorry my dad is being such a douche.

908
01:11:43,032 --> 01:11:45,668
Whatever. I gotta fly out
early tomorrow anyway.

909
01:11:45,768 --> 01:11:49,489
- Me too, and I'm not even packed yet.
- Sure you're okay to drive?

910
01:11:49,589 --> 01:11:52,010
Unlike you lightweights,
I can handle my liquor.

911
01:11:55,545 --> 01:11:59,298
- God, I'm gonna miss you guys.
- Oh, my God, drama queen.

912
01:11:59,398 --> 01:12:02,086
It'll be summer soon, and we'll
be back in this rancid hellhole

913
01:12:02,186 --> 01:12:04,812
for three freakin' months.

914
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:10,326
I know. Yeah, well, take care.
Don't forget to write.

915
01:12:10,426 --> 01:12:13,228
Yeah. You too, shithead.

916
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:16,565
- Bye, Kat. Have a safe flight, all right?
- You too.

917
01:13:00,176 --> 01:13:01,649
Hey.

918
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,372
Hey.

919
01:13:06,472 --> 01:13:08,449
Are you all right?

920
01:13:08,549 --> 01:13:11,649
- You look drunk.
- Oh, yeah?

921
01:13:11,799 --> 01:13:14,022
Look who's talking.

922
01:13:16,842 --> 01:13:19,709
So you've been avoiding
me on purpose, or what?

923
01:13:21,862 --> 01:13:25,463
- What do you mean?
- I came by your house last week.

924
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:28,104
Told your mother that
I needed to talk to you.

925
01:13:28,204 --> 01:13:29,777
Really?

926
01:13:31,454 --> 01:13:33,551
I didn't get the message.

927
01:13:34,041 --> 01:13:36,325
What did you want to talk to me about?

928
01:13:38,179 --> 01:13:41,046
Just been thinking
about a lot of things.

929
01:13:42,866 --> 01:13:45,344
You know, I feel like after...

930
01:13:45,653 --> 01:13:48,574
my mother left,
everything changed between us.

931
01:13:48,874 --> 01:13:52,275
We were different. You were different.

932
01:13:54,328 --> 01:13:57,083
Everything was different after that.

933
01:13:57,183 --> 01:14:01,111
Phil, where were you that day?
You were supposed to pick me up from school.

934
01:14:02,420 --> 01:14:06,337
I told you. I was at Thomas'.

935
01:14:07,558 --> 01:14:10,012
My God, don't you get it?

936
01:14:10,112 --> 01:14:12,415
It doesn't matter anymore.
You don't have to lie.

937
01:14:12,865 --> 01:14:15,568
What do you mean?
What makes you think that I'm lying?

938
01:14:15,668 --> 01:14:17,437
Okay, I'm not accusing you of lying.

939
01:14:17,537 --> 01:14:21,789
All I'm saying is whatever it is that
you know, you can just tell me.

940
01:14:29,065 --> 01:14:33,609
You know what? What we had was sweet,
and cute, and great and everything, but...

941
01:14:33,959 --> 01:14:35,737
I think we both know that it's over.

942
01:14:36,538 --> 01:14:37,755
It's in the past,

943
01:14:37,855 --> 01:14:41,591
and I need to know what happened that
day so that I can move on with my life.

944
01:14:42,494 --> 01:14:45,878
Please, Phil, I'm not gonna get
mad at you. I just want to know.

945
01:14:47,648 --> 01:14:51,215
I told you. I don't know anything.

946
01:14:53,037 --> 01:14:55,954
Was there something going on
between you and my mother?

947
01:14:58,741 --> 01:15:01,719
- What?
- You heard me. Were you fucking my mom?

948
01:15:01,819 --> 01:15:05,217
- Because some people think that you were.
- What... what... what people?

949
01:15:05,517 --> 01:15:09,455
Kat, you're... you're drunk. And crazy.

950
01:15:09,555 --> 01:15:13,283
Phil, I just need to know!
Please, I don't care what it is.

951
01:15:13,383 --> 01:15:18,411
I just cannot keep living my life in the
dark just, like, fucking wondering!

952
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:23,835
I can't help you, Kat.

953
01:15:29,442 --> 01:15:31,059
I'm sorry.

954
01:15:45,691 --> 01:15:48,053
But I will tell you one thing.

955
01:15:49,610 --> 01:15:51,967
Your dad knows where she is.

956
01:15:52,248 --> 01:15:54,566
He's been keeping her up
his sleeve this whole time.

957
01:15:57,820 --> 01:15:59,286
What do you mean?

958
01:16:01,521 --> 01:16:03,528
Don't ask me.

959
01:16:04,805 --> 01:16:06,738
Ask him.

960
01:17:04,904 --> 01:17:06,846
Kat!

961
01:17:07,296 --> 01:17:10,735
Kat! I'm up here!

962
01:17:12,777 --> 01:17:14,762
Over here!

963
01:17:15,955 --> 01:17:18,996
No! This way!

964
01:17:19,502 --> 01:17:23,161
Yes! Right in front of you!

965
01:17:24,539 --> 01:17:27,040
I'm right here, Kat.

966
01:17:30,579 --> 01:17:32,536
Help me!

967
01:17:32,915 --> 01:17:36,684
Please! Help me, Kat!

968
01:17:39,288 --> 01:17:41,618
Help me!

969
01:19:58,544 --> 01:19:59,848
Kat!

970
01:20:02,328 --> 01:20:03,980
What are you doing?

971
01:20:09,171 --> 01:20:10,839
Dad?

972
01:20:13,256 --> 01:20:15,707
Do you know where mom is?

973
01:20:28,590 --> 01:20:30,291
What?

974
01:20:30,992 --> 01:20:33,558
Do you know where mom is?

975
01:20:34,512 --> 01:20:37,294
Because Phil says that you do.

976
01:20:39,749 --> 01:20:43,667
Phil? Your stoner boyfriend
who can't keep a job?

977
01:20:55,483 --> 01:20:58,352
The answer is no, I don't.

978
01:21:05,677 --> 01:21:07,852
Anything else?

979
01:21:18,774 --> 01:21:23,111
Well, clean up this mess. We have to
get you to the airport in a few hours.

980
01:21:28,934 --> 01:21:29,720
Dad?

981
01:21:35,174 --> 01:21:37,492
I'm sorry.

982
01:21:40,646 --> 01:21:42,419
It's all right.

983
01:22:25,874 --> 01:22:29,211
So make sure to call so I know
that you landed all right.

984
01:22:29,311 --> 01:22:30,747
Okay.

985
01:22:33,696 --> 01:22:36,531
So see you in a couple of months?

986
01:22:54,453 --> 01:22:56,537
I love you, baby.

987
01:23:02,995 --> 01:23:04,948
I love you too.

988
01:23:12,721 --> 01:23:15,393
I should probably board.

989
01:23:20,879 --> 01:23:22,732
See you.

990
01:23:29,271 --> 01:23:31,197
Goodbye, sweetheart.

991
01:24:06,058 --> 01:24:08,794
<i>That was the last time I saw my father.</i>

992
01:24:08,894 --> 01:24:11,880
<i>It turns out Beth,
Mickey and Theo were right.</i>

993
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:16,444
<i>A few weeks after I left,
my dad got shitfaced drunk in a bar,</i>

994
01:24:16,544 --> 01:24:19,142
<i>and confessed to killing my mother.</i>

995
01:24:21,137 --> 01:24:24,238
<i>He hung himself in his
jail cell with a sheet.</i>

996
01:24:25,994 --> 01:24:30,132
<i>Before he died, he revealed that my
mother's body was in the freezer,</i>

997
01:24:30,232 --> 01:24:33,768
<i>and that he'd taken it out during
the night while I was sleeping.</i>

998
01:24:34,019 --> 01:24:38,106
<i>He buried her up in the mountains.
Since it'd been frozen for so long,</i>

999
01:24:38,206 --> 01:24:43,111
<i>her corpse decomposed freakishly fast,
turning to liquid as it melted.</i>

1000
01:24:43,562 --> 01:24:47,448
<i>By the time they dug her up,
there was basically nothing left.</i>

1001
01:24:51,803 --> 01:24:54,806
<i>I was seventeen when
my mother disappeared.</i>

1002
01:24:55,307 --> 01:24:59,127
<i>Like, one day she was there,
cleaning, making dinner,</i>

1003
01:24:59,227 --> 01:25:01,144
<i>and the next...</i>

1004
01:25:02,524 --> 01:25:04,380
<i>she was gone.</i>

1005
01:26:20,275 --> 01:26:21,900
Stop it.

1006
01:26:31,069 --> 01:26:33,204
Evie, stop.

1007
01:26:39,211 --> 01:26:40,778
Evie.

1008
01:26:42,029 --> 01:26:43,679
Stop.

1009
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:53,498
Please.

1010
01:26:56,325 --> 01:26:58,010
Evie.

1011
01:26:59,481 --> 01:27:01,630
Stop!

1012
01:27:04,920 --> 01:27:06,320
Stop.

1013
01:27:42,272 --> 01:27:44,618
<i>Because I never saw my mother again,</i>

1014
01:27:44,718 --> 01:27:47,353
<i>she remains in absence to me.</i>

1015
01:27:47,929 --> 01:27:50,001
<i>An empty space.</i>

1016
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:53,688
<i>An invisible, half remembered ghost.</i>

1017
01:27:55,802 --> 01:28:00,709
<i>So even now I catch myself thinking
that I'm gonna run into her some day.</i>

1018
01:28:01,009 --> 01:28:04,379
<i>Like I'll be at a stop light,
and look over at the car next to me</i>

1019
01:28:04,479 --> 01:28:08,678
<i>and there she'll be,
scowling at me with disapproval.</i>

1020
01:28:09,051 --> 01:28:12,487
<i>Or I'll spot her across some
crowded street, or train station,</i>

1021
01:28:12,587 --> 01:28:17,639
<i>and we'll run toward each other like
one of those cheesy TV movies.</i>

1022
01:28:18,608 --> 01:28:21,592
<i>She'll hug me like a long, lost lover,</i>

1023
01:28:22,397 --> 01:28:25,312
<i>then take my face in her long,</i>

1024
01:28:25,600 --> 01:28:27,697
<i>graceful hands,</i>

1025
01:28:28,320 --> 01:28:30,988
<i>look me in the eyes and say...</i>

1026
01:28:34,576 --> 01:28:36,641
<i>"I'm here, Kat.</i>

1027
01:28:38,161 --> 01:28:39,974
<i>I'm here."</i>
