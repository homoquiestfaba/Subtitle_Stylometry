1
00:02:48,768 --> 00:02:51,768
We're here! Time to muscle up.

2
00:04:15,888 --> 00:04:18,857
Hello?

3
00:04:18,858 --> 00:04:21,858
Who's there?

4
00:04:57,997 --> 00:05:00,997
You scared me to death, you mangy thing.

5
00:05:03,102 --> 00:05:06,102
I'm just looking for an old well. Know it?

6
00:05:09,242 --> 00:05:12,242
Not talking, huh?

7
00:05:13,012 --> 00:05:15,447
Magic dowser, magic dowser,

8
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,384
show me the well!

9
00:05:29,762 --> 00:05:31,563
Get away from me!

10
00:05:41,140 --> 00:05:42,341
Ooh.

11
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:45,342
Let me guess. You're from Texas or Utah,
someplace dried-out and barren, right?

12
00:05:46,779 --> 00:05:49,779
I heard about water witching before,
but it doesn't make sense.

13
00:05:49,949 --> 00:05:52,949
-I mean, it's just an ordinary branch.
-It's a dowsing rod.

14
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,820
Ow!

15
00:05:54,821 --> 00:05:57,821
And I don't like being stalked,
not by psycho nerds or their cats!

16
00:05:59,726 --> 00:06:02,726
He's not really my cat. He's kind of feral.
You know, wild.

17
00:06:03,563 --> 00:06:05,764
Of course, I do feed him every night,

18
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:08,765
and sometimes he'll come to my window
and bring me little dead things.

19
00:06:09,836 --> 00:06:12,371
Look, I'm from Pontiac.

20
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:13,572
Huh?

21
00:06:13,573 --> 00:06:16,573
Michigan. And if I'm a water witch,
then where's the secret well?

22
00:06:19,212 --> 00:06:21,747
You stomp too hard and you'll fall in it.

23
00:06:21,748 --> 00:06:24,748
Oh!

24
00:06:25,852 --> 00:06:26,918
See?

25
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:31,087
It's supposed to be so deep,
if you fell to the bottom and looked up,

26
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:34,524
you'd see a sky full of stars
in the middle of the day.

27
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,796
Ha!

28
00:06:37,797 --> 00:06:39,598
Surprised she let you move in.

29
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,599
My gramma, she owns the Pink Palace.
Won't rent to people with kids.

30
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:45,904
What do you mean?

31
00:06:45,905 --> 00:06:48,905
I'm not supposed to
talk about it. I'm Wybie. Wybie Lovat.

32
00:06:51,043 --> 00:06:53,578
-Wybie?
-Short for Wyborne.

33
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:56,579
Not my idea, of course.
What'd you get saddled with?

34
00:06:56,983 --> 00:06:59,983
I wasn't saddled with anything. It's Coraline.

35
00:07:00,486 --> 00:07:03,486
-Caroline what?
-Coraline. Coraline Jones.

36
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:06,689
It's not reaI scientific,
but I heard an ordinary name like Caroline

37
00:07:07,994 --> 00:07:10,462
can lead people to have
ordinary expectations about a person.

38
00:07:11,564 --> 00:07:14,299
Wyborne!

39
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:16,968
I think I heard
someone calling you, Wyborne.

40
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:19,969
-What? I didn't hear anything.
-I definitely heard someone,

41
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:24,776
Why-Were-You-Born.

42
00:07:24,777 --> 00:07:27,579
-Wyborne!
-Grandma!

43
00:07:30,917 --> 00:07:33,917
Well, great to meet a Michigan water witch,

44
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:38,488
but I'd wear gloves next time.

45
00:07:38,491 --> 00:07:41,491
-Why?
-'Cause that dowsing rod of yours,

46
00:07:41,861 --> 00:07:43,328
it's poison oak.

47
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:17,696
I almost fell down a well yesterday, Mom.

48
00:08:17,697 --> 00:08:19,464
Uh-huh.

49
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:21,867
I would've died.

50
00:08:21,868 --> 00:08:23,401
That's nice.

51
00:08:23,402 --> 00:08:24,836
Hmm.

52
00:08:24,837 --> 00:08:27,837
So, can I go out?
I think it's perfect weather for gardening.

53
00:08:28,708 --> 00:08:31,708
No, Coraline. Rain makes mud.
Mud makes a mess.

54
00:08:32,345 --> 00:08:35,345
But, Mom, I want stuff growing
when my friends come to visit.

55
00:08:35,848 --> 00:08:37,849
Isn't that why we moved here?

56
00:08:37,850 --> 00:08:40,850
Something like that.
But then we had the accident.

57
00:08:41,954 --> 00:08:44,954
-It wasn't my fault you hit that truck.
-I never said it was.

58
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,092
I can't believe it.

59
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:50,093
You and Dad get paid to write about plants,
and you hate dirt.

60
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:53,198
Coraline, I don't have time for you
right now,

61
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:56,199
and you still have unpacking to do.
Lots of unpacking.

62
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:59,869
That sounds exciting!

63
00:09:00,239 --> 00:09:03,239
Oh. Some kid left this on the front porch.

64
00:09:05,211 --> 00:09:08,211
Hey, Jonesy.
Look what I found in Gramma's trunk.

65
00:09:08,481 --> 00:09:10,682
Look familiar? Wybie.

66
00:09:13,452 --> 00:09:15,253
Huh.

67
00:09:15,254 --> 00:09:18,254
A little me? That's weird.

68
00:09:18,824 --> 00:09:20,458
What's his name, anyway?

69
00:09:20,459 --> 00:09:23,459
Wybie. And I'm way too old for dolls.

70
00:09:27,867 --> 00:09:30,867
Hey, Dad. How's the writing going?

71
00:09:34,707 --> 00:09:36,474
Dad!

72
00:09:36,475 --> 00:09:39,475
Hello, Coraline and Coraline doll.

73
00:09:42,915 --> 00:09:45,450
Do you know where the garden tools are?

74
00:09:45,451 --> 00:09:48,451
It's... It's pouring out there, isn't it?

75
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:52,789
-It's just raining.
-What'd the boss say?

76
00:09:52,925 --> 00:09:55,925
''Don't even think about going out,
Coraline Jones!''

77
00:09:56,796 --> 00:09:58,663
Then you won't need the tools.

78
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:12,909
You know, this house is 150 years old.

79
00:10:14,313 --> 00:10:17,215
-So?
-So explore it.

80
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:20,216
Go out and count all the doors and windows
and write that down on...

81
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:24,087
List everything that's blue. Just let me work.

82
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,528
Ew!

83
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:37,462
No. No, no, no. No.

84
00:12:15,067 --> 00:12:18,067
One boring blue boy
in a painfully boring painting.

85
00:12:23,075 --> 00:12:26,075
Four incredibly boring windows

86
00:12:26,979 --> 00:12:29,979
and no more doors.

87
00:12:33,452 --> 00:12:36,452
All right, little me. Where are you hiding?

88
00:12:45,264 --> 00:12:48,264
Huh?

89
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,772
Hey, Mom. Where does this door go?

90
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:56,541
I'm really, really busy.

91
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:59,310
I think it's locked.

92
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:00,578
Please!

93
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:13,523
Will you stop pestering me
if I do this for you?

94
00:13:16,128 --> 00:13:19,128
Fine.

95
00:13:34,980 --> 00:13:36,815
Bricks? I don't get it.

96
00:13:37,983 --> 00:13:40,983
They must've closed this off
when they divided up the house.

97
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:44,086
You're kidding.
And why is the door so small?

98
00:13:44,156 --> 00:13:47,156
We made a deal! Zip it!

99
00:13:49,295 --> 00:13:50,428
You didn't lock it.

100
00:13:59,104 --> 00:14:02,073
Oh, my twitchy-witchy girl

101
00:14:02,074 --> 00:14:05,074
I think you are so nice
I give you bowls ofporridge

102
00:14:05,344 --> 00:14:06,544
And I give you bowls of ice cream

103
00:14:08,047 --> 00:14:10,014
Why don't you ever cook, Mom?

104
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,850
Coraline, we've been through this before.

105
00:14:11,851 --> 00:14:14,851
Your dad cooks, I clean,
and you stay out of the way.

106
00:14:15,988 --> 00:14:18,988
I swear I'll go food shopping
soon as we finish the catalog.

107
00:14:19,959 --> 00:14:22,227
Try some of the chard.
You need a vegetable.

108
00:14:22,228 --> 00:14:25,063
It looks more like slime to me.

109
00:14:25,064 --> 00:14:28,064
Well, it's slime or bedtime, fusspot.
Now what's it gonna be?

110
00:14:29,568 --> 00:14:32,568
Think they're trying to poison me?

111
00:14:51,490 --> 00:14:54,490
Don't forget about me, guys. Okay?

112
00:15:03,002 --> 00:15:06,002
Good night, little me.

113
00:16:09,168 --> 00:16:12,168
Whoa!

114
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:33,656
Huh?

115
00:16:42,201 --> 00:16:45,201
Mmm. Something smells good.

116
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:58,214
Mom? What are you doing here
in the middle of the night?

117
00:16:58,817 --> 00:17:01,817
You're just in time for supper, dear.

118
00:17:04,590 --> 00:17:07,590
You're not my mother.
My mother doesn't have...

119
00:17:10,629 --> 00:17:13,629
Buttons? Do you like them?

120
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,900
I'm your other mother, silly.

121
00:17:15,901 --> 00:17:18,901
Now go tell your other father
that supper's ready.

122
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:23,939
Well, go on. He's in his study.

123
00:17:31,750 --> 00:17:33,251
Hello?

124
00:17:33,252 --> 00:17:36,252
Hello, Coraline.

125
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,923
Wanna hear my new song?

126
00:17:38,924 --> 00:17:41,924
-My father can't play piano.
-No need to.

127
00:17:44,430 --> 00:17:46,697
This piano plays me.

128
00:17:50,235 --> 00:17:53,235
Making up a song about Coraline

129
00:17:54,239 --> 00:17:57,239
She's a peach, she's a doll
She's a pal of mine

130
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:01,145
She's as cute as a button
in the eyes of everyone

131
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:04,146
Who ever laid their eyes on Coraline

132
00:18:06,285 --> 00:18:09,285
When she comes around exploring
Mom and I will never, ever make it boring

133
00:18:09,688 --> 00:18:12,688
Our eyes will be on Coraline

134
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:16,792
I'm sorry,
but she said to tell you the food's ready.

135
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:20,131
Mmm.

136
00:18:20,132 --> 00:18:22,166
Who's starving? Raise your hand.

137
00:18:22,167 --> 00:18:23,234
Whoa!

138
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:39,081
We give our thanks and ask to bless
our mother's golden chicken breast.

139
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:53,831
Mmm!

140
00:18:53,832 --> 00:18:56,832
-This chicken is good.
-Hungry, aren't you?

141
00:18:58,237 --> 00:19:01,237
-Do you have any gravy?
-Well, here comes the gravy train.

142
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:05,007
Choo, choo!

143
00:19:11,383 --> 00:19:12,483
Huh.

144
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:15,484
Another roll? Sweet peas? Corn on the cob?

145
00:19:17,823 --> 00:19:20,024
I'm real thirsty.

146
00:19:20,025 --> 00:19:22,994
Of course. Any requests?

147
00:19:22,995 --> 00:19:25,995
Mango milkshake?

148
00:19:39,144 --> 00:19:42,144
-Home?
-We've been waiting for you, Coraline.

149
00:19:43,015 --> 00:19:44,382
-For me?
-Yep.

150
00:19:44,383 --> 00:19:47,018
Wasn't the same here without you, kiddo.

151
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,819
I didn't know I had another mother.

152
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:51,820
Of course you do. Everyone does.

153
00:19:52,057 --> 00:19:53,591
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

154
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:56,592
And soon as you're through eating,
I thought we'd play a game.

155
00:20:00,265 --> 00:20:02,533
You mean like hide-and-seek?

156
00:20:02,534 --> 00:20:05,534
Perfect. Hide-and-seek in the rain.

157
00:20:07,573 --> 00:20:09,941
What rain?

158
00:20:11,476 --> 00:20:14,345
-What about the mud?
-We love mud here.

159
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:17,346
Mud facials, mud baths, mud pies.

160
00:20:18,283 --> 00:20:21,283
-It's great for poison oak.
-How'd you know I...

161
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:25,321
I... I'd love to play,
but I better get home to my other mother.

162
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:29,527
But I'm your other mother.

163
00:20:29,528 --> 00:20:32,528
I mean my other, other mother.
Mom number one?

164
00:20:36,335 --> 00:20:38,202
I think I should get to bed.

165
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:40,671
Of course, sweetheart. It's all made up.

166
00:20:40,672 --> 00:20:43,672
-But...
-Come along, sleepyhead.

167
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,553
-Wow.
-Hello, Coraline.

168
00:20:55,554 --> 00:20:58,356
Hello, hello, hello, hello.

169
00:20:58,357 --> 00:21:01,357
-What's shaking, baby?
-Hello.

170
00:21:07,966 --> 00:21:10,401
Hey. How's it going, Loper?

171
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:12,403
Where's your swampers and chook?

172
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:15,273
Cripes almighty! How are my best trolls?

173
00:21:15,274 --> 00:21:18,274
I can't wait till summer.
You're both coming, right?

174
00:21:18,377 --> 00:21:21,377
-We're already here, Coraline.
-Gone to Oregon.

175
00:21:24,549 --> 00:21:26,684
Oh.

176
00:21:26,685 --> 00:21:29,685
The mud.

177
00:21:38,130 --> 00:21:41,130
-See you soon.
-See you soon.

178
00:22:08,093 --> 00:22:11,093
It's gone. My poison oak! It's gone!

179
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,467
Huh.

180
00:22:20,272 --> 00:22:22,206
It was incredibly real, Mom.

181
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:25,207
Only you weren't really you.
You were my other mother.

182
00:22:25,243 --> 00:22:27,111
Buttons for eyes, huh?

183
00:22:27,112 --> 00:22:30,112
Coraline, you only dreamed
you ate all that chicken.

184
00:22:30,248 --> 00:22:31,916
Take your multivitamin at least.

185
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:33,250
You were in the dream, too, Dad.

186
00:22:33,251 --> 00:22:36,251
You had wild-looking pajamas
and orange monkey slippers.

187
00:22:37,189 --> 00:22:40,189
Orange?
My monkey slippers are blue.

188
00:22:40,826 --> 00:22:43,826
Psst! Can you get me some of that
magic mud you were talking about?

189
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:47,329
Because I have a terrible case
of writer's rash on my...

190
00:22:51,002 --> 00:22:54,002
If the real Charlie Jones
wants his pages edited,

191
00:22:54,005 --> 00:22:57,005
he better wrap them up ASAP.

192
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,178
Coraline,
why don't you go visit downstairs?

193
00:23:01,179 --> 00:23:04,179
I bet those actresses
would love to hear your dream.

194
00:23:04,883 --> 00:23:07,883
Miss Spink and Forcible?
But you said they're dingbats.

195
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:11,854
Mmm-hmm.

196
00:23:21,900 --> 00:23:24,900
Bobinsky. Bobinsky. Bobinsky.

197
00:23:50,762 --> 00:23:53,164
Hello?

198
00:23:53,165 --> 00:23:56,165
I think our mail got mixed up.

199
00:23:56,468 --> 00:23:58,436
Should I leave it outside, or...

200
00:24:08,947 --> 00:24:11,947
Hmm.

201
00:24:12,551 --> 00:24:14,118
Secret!

202
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,287
Famous jumping mouse circus not ready,

203
00:24:20,158 --> 00:24:22,393
little girl.

204
00:24:22,394 --> 00:24:23,894
Circus?

205
00:24:23,895 --> 00:24:25,062
Oh, uh...

206
00:24:25,063 --> 00:24:28,063
I brought this for you.

207
00:24:34,439 --> 00:24:35,606
Huh?

208
00:24:35,607 --> 00:24:38,209
New cheese samples.

209
00:24:41,480 --> 00:24:44,480
Very clever using this mix-up
to sneak my home and peek at mooshkas?

210
00:24:47,219 --> 00:24:50,219
-Mooshkas?
-The mice!

211
00:24:50,288 --> 00:24:51,489
Oh!

212
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,490
Sorry. I'm Coraline Jones.

213
00:24:55,227 --> 00:24:58,227
And I am the Amazing Bobinsky.

214
00:25:00,131 --> 00:25:02,766
But you call me Mr. B

215
00:25:02,767 --> 00:25:05,767
because amazing I already know that I am.

216
00:25:12,577 --> 00:25:14,044
Ha!

217
00:25:14,045 --> 00:25:17,045
You see, Caroline, the problem is...
My new songs go oompah, oompah,

218
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:22,851
but the jumping mice play only toodle-toot,
like that.

219
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:26,622
Is nice but not so much amazing.

220
00:25:27,292 --> 00:25:30,292
So now, I switch to stronger cheese
and soon, watch out!

221
00:25:34,566 --> 00:25:37,566
Here, have beet. Make you strong.

222
00:25:40,205 --> 00:25:43,205
Do svidaniya, Caroline.

223
00:25:44,442 --> 00:25:47,442
Coraline.

224
00:25:52,350 --> 00:25:55,350
Oompah, oompah. Toodle-toot. Toodle-toot.

225
00:25:55,420 --> 00:25:57,187
Hey, Caroline!

226
00:25:58,456 --> 00:25:59,790
Wait!

227
00:25:59,791 --> 00:26:01,592
No!

228
00:26:05,330 --> 00:26:08,330
The mice asked me to give you message.

229
00:26:08,533 --> 00:26:10,668
The jumping mice?

230
00:26:10,669 --> 00:26:13,669
They are saying
do not go through little door.

231
00:26:16,741 --> 00:26:18,375
Do you know such a thing?

232
00:26:18,376 --> 00:26:21,376
The one behind the wallpaper?
But it's all bricked up.

233
00:26:24,182 --> 00:26:27,182
Bah. So sorry. Is nothing.

234
00:26:27,519 --> 00:26:30,519
Sometimes the mice are little mixed-up.

235
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:35,693
They even get your name wrong, you know?

236
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:38,694
They call you Coraline instead of Caroline.

237
00:26:38,863 --> 00:26:41,863
Not Caroline at all.
Maybe I work them too hard.

238
00:27:21,673 --> 00:27:24,673
Cease your infernal yapping.

239
00:27:25,210 --> 00:27:27,845
How nice to see you, Caroline.

240
00:27:27,846 --> 00:27:30,648
Would you like to come in?
We're playing cards.

241
00:27:30,649 --> 00:27:32,850
Still Coraline, Miss Spink.

242
00:27:32,851 --> 00:27:35,851
Miriam! Put the kettle on!

243
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:49,333
April, I think you're being followed.

244
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,334
It's the new neighbor, Miriam. Caroline.

245
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:55,873
She'll be having the oolong tea.

246
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:58,874
No! Oh, no, no.
I'm sure she'd prefer jasmine.

247
00:27:59,644 --> 00:28:01,679
No, oolong.

248
00:28:01,680 --> 00:28:04,415
Ah. Jasmine it is, then.

249
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:11,253
Come on, boys.

250
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:20,230
Are those dogs real?

251
00:28:20,231 --> 00:28:23,231
Our sweet departed angels.

252
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:26,301
Couldn't bear to part with them,
so we had them stuffed.

253
00:28:27,672 --> 00:28:30,507
Now, there's Hamish the third...

254
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:32,543
Go on. Have one.

255
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,544
It's hand-pulled taffy from Brighton.
Best in the world.

256
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:40,415
...the third, the ninth, yes.
The fourth, I'm right.

257
00:28:40,585 --> 00:28:43,585
And Jock Jr., Jock Sr.,
Jock the third, the fourth,

258
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:47,155
and that's Jock's second cousin
thrice removed.

259
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:51,093
I'll read them if you like.

260
00:28:51,429 --> 00:28:54,429
-Read what?
-Your tea leaves, dear.

261
00:28:54,666 --> 00:28:57,666
They'll tell me your future.
Drink up then. Go on.

262
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:03,472
No, not all of it. Not all of it.
That's right. Now hand it over.

263
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:09,947
Oh!

264
00:29:09,948 --> 00:29:11,482
Oh, Caroline.

265
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:14,483
Caroline, Caroline, Caroline.

266
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:17,586
You are in terrible danger.

267
00:29:17,722 --> 00:29:20,722
Oh, give me that cup, April.
Your eyes are going.

268
00:29:21,526 --> 00:29:24,526
My eyes? You're blind as a bat.

269
00:29:24,829 --> 00:29:27,829
Well, not to worry, child.

270
00:29:28,500 --> 00:29:31,500
It's good news. There's a tall,
handsome beast in your future.

271
00:29:34,572 --> 00:29:37,074
-A what?
-Miriam, really.

272
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:40,075
You're holding it wrong. See? Danger.

273
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:43,080
What do you see?

274
00:29:43,081 --> 00:29:46,081
I see a very peculiar hand.

275
00:29:46,151 --> 00:29:48,318
I see a giraffe.

276
00:29:48,319 --> 00:29:51,319
Giraffes don't just fall from the sky, Miriam.

277
00:29:51,823 --> 00:29:52,956
Oh, Lord.

278
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,493
Well, what should I do?

279
00:29:56,494 --> 00:29:59,029
Never wear green in your dressing room.

280
00:29:59,030 --> 00:30:01,665
Acquire a very tall stepladder.

281
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:04,034
And be very, very careful.

282
00:30:06,404 --> 00:30:09,404
Now, was there something
you came to tell us?

283
00:30:10,775 --> 00:30:13,775
No. I guess not. Thanks for the tea, though.

284
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,380
Toodle-oo.
Cheery-bye.

285
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:18,348
Do you have
any nice queens for Mummy?

286
00:30:23,555 --> 00:30:26,555
Danger?

287
00:30:43,775 --> 00:30:45,509
Great! The village stalker.

288
00:30:45,510 --> 00:30:47,211
Ow!

289
00:30:47,212 --> 00:30:50,212
I wasn't stalking you.
We're hunting banana slugs.

290
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:52,683
What do you mean ''we?''

291
00:30:55,053 --> 00:30:58,053
Ha! Your cat's not wild. He's a wuss puss.

292
00:30:59,290 --> 00:31:02,259
What? He hates to get his feet wet. Jeez.

293
00:31:02,260 --> 00:31:05,260
Wuss puss.

294
00:31:07,565 --> 00:31:10,565
So, that doll. Did you make it look like me?

295
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:14,736
Oh, no. I found it that way.

296
00:31:14,739 --> 00:31:17,739
It's older than Grandma.
Old as this house, probably.

297
00:31:18,476 --> 00:31:21,476
Come on.
Blue hair, my swampers and raincoat?

298
00:31:22,280 --> 00:31:25,280
Dang! Check out Slugzilla.

299
00:31:27,552 --> 00:31:29,853
You're just like them.

300
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:31,021
Huh?

301
00:31:31,022 --> 00:31:34,022
I meant my parents.
They don't listen to me either.

302
00:31:34,259 --> 00:31:37,259
Uh-huh. You mind?

303
00:31:42,467 --> 00:31:43,767
Hmm.

304
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:46,768
Ew!

305
00:31:51,976 --> 00:31:54,976
You know, I've never been inside
the Pink Palace.

306
00:31:55,480 --> 00:31:57,180
You're kidding.

307
00:31:57,181 --> 00:32:00,181
Grandma'd kill me.
Thinks it's dangerous or something.

308
00:32:01,786 --> 00:32:03,387
Dangerous?

309
00:32:03,388 --> 00:32:06,388
-Well, she had a twin sister.
-So?

310
00:32:07,425 --> 00:32:10,425
When they were kids,
Grandma's sister disappeared.

311
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:13,263
She says she was stolen.

312
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:14,731
Stolen?

313
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,235
Well, what do you think?

314
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:21,236
I don't know. Maybe she just ran away.

315
00:32:22,106 --> 00:32:24,441
Wyborne!

316
00:32:24,442 --> 00:32:27,442
-Look, I gotta go.
-Wait a minute.

317
00:33:42,387 --> 00:33:45,387
-Welcome back, darling.
-Hi.

318
00:33:45,456 --> 00:33:48,456
So thoughtful of you
to send this nice cheddar, Coraline.

319
00:33:49,093 --> 00:33:52,093
Cheddar? Oh! The mice bait.

320
00:33:53,431 --> 00:33:56,431
Would you go fetch your father?
I bet he's hungry as a pumpkin by now.

321
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:00,370
You mean my other father.

322
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,340
Your better father, dear.
He's out in the garden.

323
00:34:03,341 --> 00:34:05,442
But my parents don't have time to garden.

324
00:34:07,812 --> 00:34:08,945
Mmm!

325
00:34:08,946 --> 00:34:11,946
Go on.

326
00:34:40,812 --> 00:34:41,912
Oh!

327
00:35:01,999 --> 00:35:04,634
Hey.

328
00:35:04,635 --> 00:35:06,870
I love your garden!

329
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:09,871
Our garden, Coraline.

330
00:35:13,845 --> 00:35:16,845
Stop tickling me!

331
00:35:17,482 --> 00:35:20,117
Daughter in distress.

332
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:35,130
Tickle no more, you dragon snappers.

333
00:35:38,302 --> 00:35:41,302
Well, she says it's time for dinner,
breakfast, food.

334
00:35:42,907 --> 00:35:45,907
Hop on, kiddo.
I wanna show you something.

335
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,355
I can't believe you did this.

336
00:35:58,356 --> 00:36:00,290
Mother said you'd like it.

337
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:03,291
Boy, she knows you
like the back of her hand.

338
00:36:06,864 --> 00:36:08,832
Mmm. So good.

339
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,468
I love dinner-breakfast-food.

340
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:13,737
Coraline, Mr. Bobinsky has invited you

341
00:36:13,738 --> 00:36:16,473
to come see the jumping mice perform
after dinner.

342
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:19,474
Really? That know-it-all Wybie
said it was all in Mr. B's head.

343
00:36:20,745 --> 00:36:22,012
I knew he was wrong.

344
00:36:22,013 --> 00:36:24,781
Well, everything's right in this world, kiddo.

345
00:36:24,782 --> 00:36:27,782
Your father and I will clean up
while you and your friend head upstairs.

346
00:36:29,921 --> 00:36:32,921
My friend?

347
00:36:33,457 --> 00:36:36,457
Great. Another Wybie.
Hello, Why-Were-You-Born.

348
00:36:40,398 --> 00:36:42,532
Hello!

349
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,533
I thought you'd like him more
if he spoke a little less. So I fixed him.

350
00:36:47,905 --> 00:36:50,905
-So he can't talk at all?
-Nope.

351
00:36:51,342 --> 00:36:52,542
Hmm.

352
00:36:52,543 --> 00:36:53,944
I like it.

353
00:36:53,945 --> 00:36:56,945
Now, run along, you two, and have fun.

354
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:03,218
You're awful cheerful
considering you can't say anything.

355
00:37:06,724 --> 00:37:09,724
It didn't hurt, did it, when she...

356
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:23,773
Whoa!

357
00:37:26,410 --> 00:37:29,410
Cool!

358
00:37:45,730 --> 00:37:46,830
Look at you!

359
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:52,800
Lady and gentleman,
for to tickle your eyes and ears

360
00:37:55,573 --> 00:37:57,907
and making hearts to thump,

361
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:00,908
I, Sergei Alexander Bobinsky,

362
00:38:01,712 --> 00:38:04,712
am introducing my astoundishing,

363
00:38:06,050 --> 00:38:09,050
stupendulous and amazing

364
00:38:10,521 --> 00:38:13,521
jumping mouse circus!

365
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:19,429
My name!

366
00:38:41,085 --> 00:38:44,085
It's wonderful, Wybie.

367
00:38:59,103 --> 00:39:01,705
Wow!

368
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:22,023
Yahoo! That was great!

369
00:39:23,260 --> 00:39:26,260
Very, very thank you, lady and gentleman.

370
00:39:43,247 --> 00:39:46,247
We loved it, Mr. B. It was so... So...

371
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:48,952
Ah...

372
00:39:48,953 --> 00:39:50,186
Amazing!

373
00:39:50,187 --> 00:39:53,187
You are very welcome anytime you like.
You and also your good friend there.

374
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:59,127
Do svidaniya, Coraline.

375
00:40:41,906 --> 00:40:44,906
There were garden squash
like balloon animals and snapdragons.

376
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,276
Oh, and upstairs, I saw a real mouse circus.

377
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:51,281
Not pretend like the crazy man's
in our house.

378
00:40:51,282 --> 00:40:52,982
You sure you won't come?

379
00:40:52,983 --> 00:40:55,919
Don't fret, Charlie.
They'll love the new catalog.

380
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,987
At least they'll love my chapters.

381
00:40:57,988 --> 00:41:00,988
I did not call him crazy, Coraline.
He's drunk.

382
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,459
Well, I guess I'll see you around,
you dizzy dreamer.

383
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:07,962
Dad! I'm not five anymore.

384
00:41:33,657 --> 00:41:36,657
My kingdom for a horse!

385
00:41:49,907 --> 00:41:51,207
Put them back.

386
00:41:51,208 --> 00:41:54,208
But, Mom, the whole school's gonna wear
boring gray clothes. No one will have these.

387
00:41:57,548 --> 00:42:00,548
Put them back.

388
00:42:01,118 --> 00:42:03,119
My other mother would get them.

389
00:42:03,120 --> 00:42:06,120
Maybe she should buy all your clothes.

390
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:12,428
So what do you think
is in the other apartment?

391
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:15,429
I don't know.
Not a family of Jones imposters.

392
00:42:16,767 --> 00:42:19,135
-Then why'd you lock the door?
-Oh!

393
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:22,136
I found some rat crap,
and I thought you'd feel safer.

394
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:27,041
They're jumping mice, Mom,
and the dreams aren't dangerous.

395
00:42:28,579 --> 00:42:31,579
They're the most fun I've had
since we've moved here.

396
00:42:31,715 --> 00:42:34,715
-Your school might be fun.
-With those stupid uniforms? Right.

397
00:42:37,254 --> 00:42:40,254
Had to give it a try.

398
00:42:52,169 --> 00:42:55,169
How do you feel about a mustard,
ketchup, salsa wrap for lunch?

399
00:42:56,373 --> 00:42:58,575
Are you kidding me?

400
00:42:58,576 --> 00:43:01,576
Had to go food shopping, anyway.
Dad's planning something special.

401
00:43:03,414 --> 00:43:05,348
Grossgusting.

402
00:43:05,349 --> 00:43:08,251
You wanna come along?
You can pick out something you like.

403
00:43:08,252 --> 00:43:10,286
Oh. Like the gloves.

404
00:43:11,388 --> 00:43:14,388
Look, Coraline, if things go well today,
I promise I'll make it up.

405
00:43:16,860 --> 00:43:19,860
That's what you always say.

406
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:24,701
Won't be long.

407
00:43:24,702 --> 00:43:27,702
But I might be.

408
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:10,177
I knew it was real.

409
00:44:32,503 --> 00:44:34,103
Dearest Coraline,

410
00:44:34,104 --> 00:44:37,104
Miss Spink and Miss Forcible
have invited you downstairs after lunch.

411
00:44:38,308 --> 00:44:41,308
I hope you like the new outfit I made you.
Love, Mother.

412
00:44:54,391 --> 00:44:56,526
Wybie's got a cat like you at home.

413
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:01,629
Not the quiet Wybie.
The one that talks too much.

414
00:45:02,733 --> 00:45:05,001
You must be the other cat.

415
00:45:05,002 --> 00:45:08,002
No, I'm not the other anything. I'm me.

416
00:45:09,606 --> 00:45:12,475
Um... I can see you don't have button eyes,

417
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:15,476
but if you're the same cat,
how can you talk?

418
00:45:17,181 --> 00:45:19,649
I just can.

419
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:21,150
Cats don't talk at home.

420
00:45:21,151 --> 00:45:22,585
-No?
-Nope.

421
00:45:22,586 --> 00:45:25,586
Well, you're clearly
the expert on these things.

422
00:45:26,423 --> 00:45:29,423
After all, I'm just a big fat wuss puss.

423
00:45:30,994 --> 00:45:33,994
Come back. Please?
I'm sorry I called you that. I really am.

424
00:45:35,299 --> 00:45:36,666
How'd you get here?

425
00:45:36,667 --> 00:45:39,667
I've been coming here for a while.

426
00:45:42,406 --> 00:45:44,640
It's a game we play.

427
00:45:44,641 --> 00:45:47,641
She hates cats and tries to keep me out,

428
00:45:48,779 --> 00:45:51,779
but she can't, of course.
I come and go as I please.

429
00:45:52,649 --> 00:45:54,684
The other mother hates cats?

430
00:45:54,685 --> 00:45:57,685
Not like any mother I've ever known.

431
00:45:57,855 --> 00:46:00,855
What do you mean? She's amazing.

432
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:03,924
You probably think this world
is a dream come true, but you're wrong.

433
00:46:06,196 --> 00:46:08,564
The other Wybie told me so.

434
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:10,800
That's nonsense. He can't talk.

435
00:46:10,801 --> 00:46:12,969
Perhaps not to you.

436
00:46:12,970 --> 00:46:15,970
We cats, however,
have far superior senses than humans,

437
00:46:17,407 --> 00:46:20,407
and can see and smell and...

438
00:46:20,444 --> 00:46:21,577
Shh!

439
00:46:21,578 --> 00:46:24,578
I hear something. Right over...

440
00:47:07,090 --> 00:47:10,090
Hey, Wybie.

441
00:47:22,673 --> 00:47:24,774
She's practically naked!

442
00:47:24,775 --> 00:47:27,775
I'm known as the siren
of all seven seas

443
00:47:28,812 --> 00:47:31,812
The breaker of hearts by the bay

444
00:47:32,616 --> 00:47:35,616
So ifyou go swimming
With bowlegged women

445
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,687
I might steal your weak heart away

446
00:47:53,570 --> 00:47:54,971
Oh, my God.

447
00:47:54,972 --> 00:47:57,972
A big-bottomed sea witch
May bob through the waves

448
00:47:59,076 --> 00:48:02,076
And hope to lead sailors astray

449
00:48:02,713 --> 00:48:05,713
But a true ocean goddess
Must fill out her bodice

450
00:48:08,352 --> 00:48:11,352
To present an alluring display

451
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:21,729
Oh! Beware of old oysters
too large in the chest

452
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:26,333
Let's banish them from the buffet

453
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:29,238
I'm far more nutritious

454
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:31,474
You smell like the fishes

455
00:48:31,475 --> 00:48:33,676
Did I hear a banshee?

456
00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:36,078
You're sea green with envy

457
00:48:36,079 --> 00:48:38,314
This mermaid enchantress

458
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:41,315
No, I, Birth of Venus

459
00:48:41,885 --> 00:48:44,787
-Will send sailors swooning...
-Will send sailors swooning all day

460
00:49:14,351 --> 00:49:15,985
I can't look.

461
00:49:15,986 --> 00:49:18,986
Ready to break a leg, Miriam?

462
00:49:19,623 --> 00:49:22,623
Our lives for the theater, April.

463
00:49:42,646 --> 00:49:45,646
''What a piece of work
is man! How noble in reason!''

464
00:49:48,352 --> 00:49:50,553
''How infinite in faculty.''

465
00:49:50,554 --> 00:49:53,554
''In form, in moving
how express and admirable!''

466
00:49:55,025 --> 00:49:58,025
''In action like an angel.''

467
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:01,929
''In apprehension how like a god!''

468
00:50:05,102 --> 00:50:07,837
''The beauty of the world!''

469
00:50:09,606 --> 00:50:12,606
''The paragon of animals!''

470
00:50:16,613 --> 00:50:19,613
Yeah!

471
00:50:52,516 --> 00:50:54,183
Hey, there.

472
00:50:54,184 --> 00:50:55,985
Was it wonderful, dear?

473
00:50:55,986 --> 00:50:58,986
Oh, yeah. They swooped down
and pulled me right out of my seat,

474
00:50:59,256 --> 00:51:01,690
Spink and Forcible,
only they weren't old ladies.

475
00:51:01,691 --> 00:51:04,691
That was just a disguise. But then,
I was flying through the air, and it was...

476
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,997
It was magic.

477
00:51:07,998 --> 00:51:10,266
You do like it here, don't you, Coraline?

478
00:51:10,267 --> 00:51:11,767
Uh-huh.

479
00:51:11,768 --> 00:51:14,768
Good night, Wybie.

480
00:51:23,780 --> 00:51:26,780
You could stay here forever if you want to.

481
00:51:27,317 --> 00:51:28,984
-Really?
-Sure.

482
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:31,985
We'll sing and play games,
and Mother will cook your favorite meals.

483
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:35,424
There's one tiny little thing we need to do.

484
00:51:35,425 --> 00:51:38,425
-What's that?
-Well, it's a surprise.

485
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:45,499
For you, our little doll.

486
00:51:50,574 --> 00:51:53,242
Black is traditional.

487
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:56,243
But if you'd prefer pink
or vermillion or chartreuse...

488
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,618
Though you might make me jealous.

489
00:52:02,619 --> 00:52:05,619
No way!
You're not sewing buttons in my eyes!

490
00:52:05,822 --> 00:52:08,822
But we need a ''yes''
if you want to stay here.

491
00:52:09,025 --> 00:52:10,893
So sharp you won't feel a...

492
00:52:10,894 --> 00:52:13,162
Ow!

493
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:16,163
There, now. It's your decision, darling.

494
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:20,236
We only want what's best for you.

495
00:52:20,237 --> 00:52:22,671
I'm going to bed. Right now!

496
00:52:22,672 --> 00:52:24,840
-Bed?
-Before dinner?

497
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:27,476
I'm really, really tired. Yeah.

498
00:52:28,612 --> 00:52:31,612
I just need to sleep on things.

499
00:52:31,715 --> 00:52:34,715
Well, of course you do, darling.
I'll be happy to tuck you in.

500
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:37,653
Oh, no, thanks.
You've done so much already.

501
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:40,654
You're welcome. And I...

502
00:52:42,058 --> 00:52:45,058
We aren't worried at all, darling.

503
00:52:45,128 --> 00:52:48,128
Soon you'll see things our way.

504
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,849
What's wrong, Coraline?
Don't you wanna play?

505
00:53:10,387 --> 00:53:13,155
Yeah! I wanna hug your face!

506
00:53:13,156 --> 00:53:15,090
Get a grip, soldier!

507
00:53:15,091 --> 00:53:16,392
Hey!
Hey!

508
00:53:16,393 --> 00:53:18,627
Where's your buttons, Loper?

509
00:53:18,628 --> 00:53:20,763
You want to stay, don't you?

510
00:53:20,764 --> 00:53:23,764
Going home tonight, robots,
and I won't be back.

511
00:53:32,008 --> 00:53:34,310
Go to sleep. Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

512
00:53:34,311 --> 00:53:35,377
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

513
00:53:35,378 --> 00:53:36,879
...a tiny little thing we need to do.

514
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,280
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

515
00:53:38,281 --> 00:53:40,115
So sharp you won't feel a thing.

516
00:53:40,116 --> 00:53:41,750
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

517
00:53:41,751 --> 00:53:44,751
Soon you'll see things our way.

518
00:53:51,695 --> 00:53:54,597
Mom! Dad!

519
00:53:55,699 --> 00:53:58,699
Oh, God. I'm still here?

520
00:54:15,619 --> 00:54:17,786
Hey, you!

521
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:20,787
Where's the other mother?
I wanna go home.

522
00:54:21,191 --> 00:54:24,191
All will be swell,
soon as Mother's refreshed.

523
00:54:24,794 --> 00:54:27,794
Her strength is our strength.

524
00:54:31,568 --> 00:54:34,069
Mustn't talk when Mother's not here.

525
00:54:34,070 --> 00:54:37,070
If you won't even talk to me,
I'm gonna find the other Wybie.

526
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,241
-He'll help me.
-No point.

527
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:42,242
He pulled a long face,
and Mother didn't like it.

528
00:55:08,571 --> 00:55:11,571
And what do you think you're doing?

529
00:55:11,741 --> 00:55:14,741
Well, I'm getting out of here.
That's what I'm doing.

530
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:18,647
Huh?

531
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:21,648
Something's wrong.
Shouldn't the old well be here?

532
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:24,153
Nothing out here.

533
00:55:24,154 --> 00:55:26,655
It's the empty part of this world.

534
00:55:26,656 --> 00:55:29,656
She only made
what she knew would impress you.

535
00:55:30,060 --> 00:55:33,060
But why? Why does she want me?

536
00:55:33,430 --> 00:55:36,430
She wants something to love, I think.

537
00:55:36,466 --> 00:55:39,001
Something that isn't her.

538
00:55:39,002 --> 00:55:42,002
Or maybe she'd just love something to eat.

539
00:55:43,973 --> 00:55:46,973
Eat? That's ridiculous.
Mothers don't eat daughters.

540
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:51,347
I don't know. How do you taste?

541
00:55:58,521 --> 00:56:00,389
Huh?

542
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:03,390
But how can you walk away from something
and still come back to it?

543
00:56:07,263 --> 00:56:09,365
Walk around the world.

544
00:56:09,366 --> 00:56:10,666
Small world.

545
00:56:11,901 --> 00:56:14,901
Hang on.

546
00:56:17,741 --> 00:56:20,741
Stop! He's one of the circus mice!

547
00:56:29,586 --> 00:56:32,521
I don't like rats at the best of times,

548
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:35,522
but this one was sounding an alarm.

549
00:56:38,395 --> 00:56:41,395
Good kitty.

550
00:57:16,766 --> 00:57:19,766
They say even the proudest spirit
can be broken with love.

551
00:57:26,576 --> 00:57:29,576
Of course, chocolate never hurts. Like one?

552
00:57:31,815 --> 00:57:34,815
They're cocoa beetles from Zanzibar.

553
00:57:38,822 --> 00:57:41,822
I want to be with my real mom and dad.

554
00:57:44,027 --> 00:57:47,027
I want you to let me go.

555
00:57:48,031 --> 00:57:50,499
Is that any way to talk to your mother?

556
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:53,135
You aren't my mother.

557
00:57:53,136 --> 00:57:56,136
Apologize at once, Coraline!

558
00:57:58,274 --> 00:58:00,642
No!

559
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:03,643
I'll give you to the count of three.

560
00:58:05,348 --> 00:58:07,850
One.

561
00:58:07,851 --> 00:58:10,851
Two.

562
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:12,888
Three!

563
00:58:12,889 --> 00:58:14,022
Ow!

564
00:58:14,023 --> 00:58:17,023
What are you doing? Ow! That hurts!

565
00:58:21,164 --> 00:58:24,164
You may come out when you've learned
to be a loving daughter.

566
00:58:37,080 --> 00:58:39,114
Who's there?

567
00:58:39,115 --> 00:58:42,115
Hush! And shush.
For the beldam might be listening.

568
00:58:45,722 --> 00:58:48,722
You... You mean the other mother?

569
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:02,905
Who are you?

570
00:59:02,906 --> 00:59:05,774
Don't remember our names,

571
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:08,775
but I 'member my true mommy.

572
00:59:10,446 --> 00:59:12,514
Why are you all here?

573
00:59:12,515 --> 00:59:15,117
The beldam.

574
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:18,118
She spied on our lives
through the little doll's eyes.

575
00:59:20,523 --> 00:59:23,523
And saw that we weren't happy.

576
00:59:24,227 --> 00:59:27,227
So she lured us away with treasures.

577
00:59:27,430 --> 00:59:30,430
-And treats.
-And games to play.

578
00:59:30,466 --> 00:59:32,801
Gave all that we asked.

579
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:35,802
Yet we still wanted more.

580
00:59:35,972 --> 00:59:38,972
So we let her sew the buttons.

581
00:59:42,645 --> 00:59:45,380
She said that she loved us.

582
00:59:45,381 --> 00:59:47,649
But she locked us here.

583
00:59:47,650 --> 00:59:50,650
And ate up our lives.

584
00:59:54,057 --> 00:59:57,057
Well, she can't keep me in the dark forever.

585
00:59:58,895 --> 01:00:01,895
Not if she wants to win my life.

586
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:05,765
Beating her is my only chance.

587
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:09,436
Perhaps, if you do win your escape,

588
01:00:09,505 --> 01:00:12,140
you could find our eyes.

589
01:00:12,141 --> 01:00:14,009
Has she taken those, too?

590
01:00:14,010 --> 01:00:16,812
Yes, miss. And hidden them.

591
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:19,813
Find our eyes, mistress,
and our souls will be freed.

592
01:00:22,452 --> 01:00:23,819
I...

593
01:00:23,820 --> 01:00:25,887
I'll try.

594
01:00:32,862 --> 01:00:35,664
Wybie?

595
01:00:37,266 --> 01:00:40,266
Did she do this to you?

596
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:48,441
-I hope that feels...
-Shh!

597
01:00:54,384 --> 01:00:56,785
Coraline? Is that you?

598
01:00:56,786 --> 01:00:59,786
Let's go!

599
01:01:01,591 --> 01:01:04,591
Coraline!

600
01:01:04,761 --> 01:01:07,761
Come on! She'll hurt you again.

601
01:01:12,468 --> 01:01:15,468
Coraline!
How dare you disobey your mother!

602
01:01:20,109 --> 01:01:23,109
Coraline!

603
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:39,359
I'm home!

604
01:01:41,664 --> 01:01:44,664
Anybody here?

605
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:48,303
Hello? Hello, hello!

606
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:51,173
Real Dad?

607
01:01:51,174 --> 01:01:53,208
Real Mom?

608
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:56,209
Oh, Mom's groceries!

609
01:01:57,146 --> 01:01:58,280
Ugh!

610
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:00,916
That's disgusting.

611
01:02:03,586 --> 01:02:06,586
I missed you guys so much, you'll never...

612
01:02:07,623 --> 01:02:10,623
-Oh. The Wybie that talks.
-Huh?

613
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:15,295
Yeah, so, you know that old doll I gave you?

614
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:18,233
Um...

615
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:21,234
My grandma's real mad.
Says it was her sister's.

616
01:02:21,671 --> 01:02:24,671
-The one that disappeared.
-You stole that doll, didn't you?

617
01:02:25,308 --> 01:02:28,110
Well, it looked just like you, and I figured...

618
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:31,111
It used to look like this pioneer girl,
then Huck Finn Jr.,

619
01:02:32,315 --> 01:02:35,315
then it was this Little Rascals chick
with all these ribbons and braids and...

620
01:02:36,786 --> 01:02:39,786
Grandma's missing sister.
I think I just met her. Come on.

621
01:02:42,592 --> 01:02:44,793
Listen,
I'm really not supposed to...

622
01:02:44,794 --> 01:02:47,794
Whoa!

623
01:02:50,433 --> 01:02:53,433
She's in there.

624
01:02:54,203 --> 01:02:56,638
Can you... Can you unlock it?

625
01:02:56,639 --> 01:02:59,574
Not in a million years.
But it wouldn't matter.

626
01:02:59,575 --> 01:03:02,575
She can't escape without her eyes.
None of the ghosts can.

627
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:07,947
Yeah. So I really need to get that doll.

628
01:03:08,785 --> 01:03:11,785
Great! I'd love to get rid of it.

629
01:03:12,688 --> 01:03:15,457
Where are you hiding, you little monster?

630
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:18,458
-You and Grandma been talking?
-The doll's her spy.

631
01:03:18,694 --> 01:03:21,694
It's how she watches you,
finds out what's wrong with your life.

632
01:03:22,165 --> 01:03:25,165
-The doll is my grandma's spy?
-No. The other mother.

633
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:28,870
She's got this whole world
where everything's better.

634
01:03:28,871 --> 01:03:31,871
The food, the garden, the neighbors.
But it's all a trap.

635
01:03:35,711 --> 01:03:38,711
Yeah, I think I heard
someone calling me, Jonesy.

636
01:03:39,081 --> 01:03:42,050
Don't believe me? You can ask the cat.

637
01:03:42,051 --> 01:03:45,051
The cat? I'll just tell Grandma
that you couldn't find the doll. Ow!

638
01:03:46,823 --> 01:03:48,790
You're not listening to me!

639
01:03:48,791 --> 01:03:51,693
That's 'cause you're crazy!

640
01:03:57,233 --> 01:03:59,634
-You creep!
-Crazy!

641
01:03:59,635 --> 01:04:02,635
Crazy?
You're the jerk wad that gave me the doll!

642
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:07,907
Mom! Dad!

643
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:17,016
Pick it up, Dad. Pick it up.

644
01:04:18,821 --> 01:04:19,955
Dad! Where...

645
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:22,057
Hi! I'm digging in my garden right now,

646
01:04:22,058 --> 01:04:25,058
but leave a message
and I'll get right back to you.

647
01:04:25,094 --> 01:04:28,094
Where have you gone?

648
01:04:34,804 --> 01:04:37,804
Uh... Don't you only make wings
for the dead ones?

649
01:04:38,040 --> 01:04:40,075
Just looking ahead, dear.

650
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:42,711
Angus hasn't been feeling very well of late.

651
01:04:42,712 --> 01:04:44,946
April? Aren't you getting ready?

652
01:04:44,947 --> 01:04:47,182
We've lost our ride, Miriam.

653
01:04:47,183 --> 01:04:50,183
Caroline says her parents
have vanished quite completely.

654
01:04:50,753 --> 01:04:53,753
What?
We've waited months for those tickets.

655
01:04:54,490 --> 01:04:56,524
I suppose we could walk.

656
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:59,525
With your gammy legs?
It's nearly two miles to the theater.

657
01:05:04,533 --> 01:05:07,533
Oh, yes. Your missing parents.

658
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:11,206
We know just what you need.

659
01:05:11,207 --> 01:05:14,207
Miriam, get... That's right.

660
01:05:16,846 --> 01:05:18,680
How is 100-year-old candy gonna help?

661
01:05:32,561 --> 01:05:35,561
There you go, sweetie.

662
01:05:35,998 --> 01:05:38,633
-What's it for?
-Well, it might help.

663
01:05:38,634 --> 01:05:41,002
They're good for bad things sometimes.

664
01:05:41,003 --> 01:05:44,003
No.
They're good for lost things.

665
01:05:44,106 --> 01:05:46,341
It's bad things, Miriam.

666
01:05:46,342 --> 01:05:48,843
-Lost things, April.
-Bad.

667
01:05:48,844 --> 01:05:50,712
-Lost.
-Bad things.

668
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:51,947
-Lost.
-Bad.

669
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:53,014
-Lost.
-Bad.

670
01:05:53,015 --> 01:05:54,115
-Lost.
-Bad.

671
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:57,116
Lost!

672
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:25,447
Good night, Mom.

673
01:06:25,448 --> 01:06:28,448
Good night, Dad.

674
01:06:57,279 --> 01:07:00,279
Hello. How did you get in?

675
01:07:01,117 --> 01:07:04,117
Do you know where Mom and Dad are?

676
01:07:16,298 --> 01:07:19,298
Mom? Dad!

677
01:07:38,654 --> 01:07:41,654
How did this happen?

678
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,901
She's taken them.

679
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:35,842
They're not coming back, are they?
Mom and Dad.

680
01:08:37,279 --> 01:08:40,279
Not on their own.

681
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:43,983
Only one thing to do.

682
01:09:14,416 --> 01:09:17,416
You know,
you're walking right into her trap.

683
01:09:18,988 --> 01:09:21,956
I have to go back.

684
01:09:21,957 --> 01:09:24,957
They are my parents.

685
01:09:25,561 --> 01:09:28,561
Challenge her, then.
She may not play fair, but she won't refuse.

686
01:09:30,699 --> 01:09:33,699
She's got a thing for games.

687
01:09:33,903 --> 01:09:35,637
Hmm.

688
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:38,206
Okay.

689
01:09:40,976 --> 01:09:43,545
-Coraline?
-Mom?

690
01:09:43,546 --> 01:09:46,381
Coraline! You came back for us.

691
01:09:46,382 --> 01:09:49,382
Mom!

692
01:09:50,686 --> 01:09:53,686
Darling, why would you run away from me?

693
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:01,429
Where are my parents?

694
01:10:01,430 --> 01:10:04,430
Gosh, I have no idea
where your old parents are.

695
01:10:05,534 --> 01:10:08,534
Perhaps they've grown bored of you
and run away to France.

696
01:10:08,604 --> 01:10:11,072
They weren't bored of me. You stole them!

697
01:10:11,073 --> 01:10:14,073
Now, don't be difficult, Coraline.

698
01:10:14,076 --> 01:10:16,911
Have a seat, won't you?

699
01:10:28,824 --> 01:10:31,824
Mmm.

700
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:38,798
-Why don't you have your own key?
-Only one key.

701
01:10:39,802 --> 01:10:41,035
Shh!

702
01:10:41,036 --> 01:10:44,036
The garden squash need tending,
don't you think, pumpkin?

703
01:10:44,907 --> 01:10:47,907
Squish-squash, pumpkin sauce.

704
01:10:52,615 --> 01:10:54,749
Mom?

705
01:10:54,750 --> 01:10:55,984
Dad?

706
01:10:57,586 --> 01:10:58,720
Where'd she hide you?

707
01:10:59,989 --> 01:11:02,989
Breakfast time!

708
01:11:07,563 --> 01:11:10,365
Be strong, Coraline.

709
01:11:24,179 --> 01:11:27,179
Why don't we play a game?

710
01:11:27,716 --> 01:11:30,716
-I know you like them.
-Everybody likes games.

711
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:33,087
Uh-huh.

712
01:11:33,088 --> 01:11:35,256
What kind of game would it be?

713
01:11:35,257 --> 01:11:38,257
An exploring game. A finding things game.

714
01:11:39,495 --> 01:11:42,495
And what is it you'd be finding, Coraline?

715
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:45,166
My real parents.

716
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:46,534
Too easy.

717
01:11:46,535 --> 01:11:49,535
And the eyes of the ghost children.

718
01:11:50,806 --> 01:11:52,173
Huh.

719
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:54,575
What if you don't find them?

720
01:11:54,576 --> 01:11:57,576
If I lose, I'll stay here with you forever
and let you love me.

721
01:12:00,749 --> 01:12:03,749
And I'll let you sew buttons into my eyes.

722
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:05,253
Hmm.

723
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:08,254
And if you somehow win this game?

724
01:12:08,891 --> 01:12:11,559
Then you let me go. You let everyone go.

725
01:12:11,560 --> 01:12:13,227
My real father and mother,

726
01:12:13,228 --> 01:12:16,030
the dead children,
everyone you've trapped here.

727
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:19,600
Deal.

728
01:12:19,601 --> 01:12:22,370
Not till you give me a clue.

729
01:12:22,371 --> 01:12:24,939
Oh, right.

730
01:12:24,940 --> 01:12:27,940
In each of three wonders
I've made just for you,

731
01:12:28,877 --> 01:12:31,877
a ghost's eye is lost in plain sight.

732
01:12:34,049 --> 01:12:35,883
And for my parents?

733
01:12:39,588 --> 01:12:42,523
Fine. Don't tell me.

734
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:46,461
It's a deal.

735
01:12:54,403 --> 01:12:57,403
What does she mean, ''wonders?''

736
01:13:04,046 --> 01:13:07,046
Hmm.

737
01:13:21,029 --> 01:13:24,029
Ugh!

738
01:13:36,311 --> 01:13:39,311
No!

739
01:13:57,966 --> 01:14:00,966
Stop!

740
01:14:17,019 --> 01:14:19,921
Why steal this?

741
01:14:21,890 --> 01:14:24,890
Wow!

742
01:14:31,066 --> 01:14:34,066
That must be it!

743
01:14:36,972 --> 01:14:39,972
Sorry.

744
01:14:40,175 --> 01:14:43,175
So sorry. Mother making me.

745
01:14:45,714 --> 01:14:48,714
Don't wanna hurt you!

746
01:14:57,426 --> 01:15:00,426
Take it!

747
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:15,643
Bless you, miss. You found me!

748
01:15:15,644 --> 01:15:18,644
But there's two eyes still lost.

749
01:15:19,548 --> 01:15:22,548
Don't worry. I'm getting the hang of it.

750
01:16:47,569 --> 01:16:50,569
The pearl.

751
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:53,207
-Thief!
-Thief!

752
01:16:53,208 --> 01:16:55,276
-Give it back!
-Give it back!

753
01:16:55,277 --> 01:16:56,477
-Thief!
-Thief!

754
01:16:56,478 --> 01:16:57,778
Give it back!

755
01:16:57,779 --> 01:16:59,280
-Thief!
-Thief!

756
01:16:59,281 --> 01:17:00,481
-Thief!
-Thief!

757
01:17:00,482 --> 01:17:01,916
-Give it back!
-Thief!

758
01:17:01,917 --> 01:17:03,551
-Thief!
-Give it back!

759
01:17:03,552 --> 01:17:04,685
-Give it back!
-Thief!

760
01:17:04,686 --> 01:17:06,587
-Give it back!
-Give it back!

761
01:17:06,588 --> 01:17:09,390
Thief!

762
01:17:09,391 --> 01:17:10,591
-Thief!
-Thief!

763
01:17:10,592 --> 01:17:13,127
Stop! Stop! Thief! Thief!

764
01:17:13,128 --> 01:17:16,128
Thief! Stop!

765
01:17:22,237 --> 01:17:25,237
Hurry on, girl. Her web is unwinding.

766
01:17:42,324 --> 01:17:44,825
Oh, Wybie.

767
01:17:44,826 --> 01:17:47,826
Evil witch! I'm not scared!

768
01:18:05,647 --> 01:18:08,647
Hello, galoobooshka.

769
01:18:09,418 --> 01:18:12,186
I'm Coraline.

770
01:18:12,187 --> 01:18:15,187
Is this what you're looking for?

771
01:18:17,626 --> 01:18:19,393
Uh-huh.

772
01:18:19,394 --> 01:18:22,394
You think winning game is good thing?

773
01:18:25,967 --> 01:18:28,967
You'll just go home and be bored
and neglected,

774
01:18:30,772 --> 01:18:33,772
same as always. Stay here with us.

775
01:18:36,945 --> 01:18:39,945
We will listen to you and laugh with you.

776
01:18:50,258 --> 01:18:53,258
If you stay here,
you can have whatever you want.

777
01:18:57,232 --> 01:18:59,667
Always!

778
01:18:59,668 --> 01:19:01,702
You don't get it, do you?

779
01:19:01,703 --> 01:19:04,703
I don't understand.

780
01:19:04,906 --> 01:19:06,941
Of course you don't understand.

781
01:19:06,942 --> 01:19:09,543
You're just a copy she made
of the real Mr. B.

782
01:19:09,544 --> 01:19:12,544
Not even that anymore.

783
01:19:28,730 --> 01:19:29,930
No!

784
01:19:38,340 --> 01:19:40,007
No!

785
01:19:45,714 --> 01:19:48,315
No!

786
01:20:09,070 --> 01:20:12,070
Oh, God. I've lost the game.
I've lost everything.

787
01:20:24,519 --> 01:20:27,519
I think I mentioned
that I don't like rats at the best of times.

788
01:20:30,659 --> 01:20:33,659
I think you might have said
something like that.

789
01:20:33,728 --> 01:20:36,728
It looked like you needed this one, however.

790
01:20:38,033 --> 01:20:41,033
Thank you.

791
01:20:44,806 --> 01:20:47,806
I'm heading inside.
I still have to find my parents.

792
01:21:13,935 --> 01:21:16,935
Come on, quickly!

793
01:21:59,047 --> 01:22:02,047
So you're back.

794
01:22:02,984 --> 01:22:05,519
And you brought vermin with you.

795
01:22:06,688 --> 01:22:09,688
No. I...

796
01:22:10,325 --> 01:22:12,760
I brought a friend.

797
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:15,761
You know I love you.

798
01:22:20,468 --> 01:22:23,468
You have a very funny way of showing it.

799
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:28,674
So where are they? The ghost eyes?

800
01:22:35,517 --> 01:22:38,517
Hold on. We aren't finished yet. Are we?

801
01:22:40,488 --> 01:22:42,890
No, I suppose not.

802
01:22:42,891 --> 01:22:45,891
After all, you still need to find
your old parents, don't you?

803
01:22:50,165 --> 01:22:53,165
Too bad you won't have this.

804
01:23:04,512 --> 01:23:07,512
Be clever, miss.
Even ifyou win, she'll never let you go!

805
01:23:17,192 --> 01:23:20,027
I already know where you've hidden them.

806
01:23:21,696 --> 01:23:24,696
Well, produce them.

807
01:23:26,167 --> 01:23:28,402
They're behind that door.

808
01:23:28,403 --> 01:23:31,403
Oh, they are, are they?

809
01:23:42,317 --> 01:23:45,317
There.

810
01:23:46,354 --> 01:23:48,455
Mom. Dad.

811
01:23:53,161 --> 01:23:56,161
Go on. Open it. They'll be there, all right.

812
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:02,434
You're wrong, Coraline. They aren't there.

813
01:24:06,608 --> 01:24:09,608
Now you're going to stay here forever.

814
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:15,547
No, I'm not!

815
01:24:28,663 --> 01:24:31,663
No!

816
01:24:32,834 --> 01:24:35,834
You horrible cheating girl!

817
01:24:53,855 --> 01:24:56,855
No! Where are you?

818
01:24:57,859 --> 01:25:00,859
You selfish brat!

819
01:25:17,445 --> 01:25:20,314
You dare disobey your mother?

820
01:25:26,721 --> 01:25:27,955
Please shut it!

821
01:25:43,571 --> 01:25:46,571
Don't leave me! Don't leave me!

822
01:25:47,242 --> 01:25:50,110
I'll die without you!

823
01:26:21,209 --> 01:26:22,709
Coraline, we're home.

824
01:26:22,710 --> 01:26:25,012
Mom! Dad! I missed you so much!

825
01:26:26,114 --> 01:26:29,114
Missed us? Oh, no.
You broke my favorite snow globe.

826
01:26:30,318 --> 01:26:33,220
I didn't break it.
It must've broke when you escaped.

827
01:26:33,221 --> 01:26:34,421
And cut your knee.

828
01:26:34,422 --> 01:26:37,124
Coraline, I asked you
to count all the windows,

829
01:26:37,125 --> 01:26:38,859
not put your knee through them.

830
01:26:38,860 --> 01:26:41,395
-But...
-Well, get yourself cleaned up.

831
01:26:41,396 --> 01:26:44,396
-We're going out tonight.
-We got a lot to celebrate.

832
01:26:45,433 --> 01:26:48,433
You're talking about your garden catalog?

833
01:26:49,037 --> 01:26:51,538
Of course. What else?

834
01:26:51,539 --> 01:26:54,208
But look at the snow on your...

835
01:26:54,209 --> 01:26:57,209
What's gotten into you, Coraline?

836
01:27:12,026 --> 01:27:14,761
-So, gonna order the tulips?
-What's that?

837
01:27:14,762 --> 01:27:16,430
For the garden party?

838
01:27:16,431 --> 01:27:19,032
I have no idea what you're talking about.

839
01:27:19,033 --> 01:27:22,033
Dad! So, Ma, invitations?

840
01:27:22,971 --> 01:27:25,971
-Don't forget the invitations.
-Even Bobinsky?

841
01:27:25,974 --> 01:27:28,974
Mr. B.'s not drunk, Mom. He's just eccentric.

842
01:27:32,313 --> 01:27:35,313
Good night, Coraline.

843
01:27:53,635 --> 01:27:55,502
Oh.

844
01:27:55,503 --> 01:27:57,804
Hello again.

845
01:27:57,805 --> 01:28:00,474
You still mad?

846
01:28:00,475 --> 01:28:03,475
I'm really sorry I threw you at her,
the other mother.

847
01:28:05,546 --> 01:28:08,546
It was all I could think of.

848
01:28:21,796 --> 01:28:24,796
I think it's time, don't you?

849
01:28:25,300 --> 01:28:28,300
To set them free?

850
01:28:49,891 --> 01:28:52,891
It's a fine, fine thing you did for us, miss.

851
01:28:53,561 --> 01:28:56,561
Well, I'm glad it's finally over.

852
01:28:58,032 --> 01:29:01,032
It is over and done with for us.

853
01:29:01,969 --> 01:29:03,537
What about me?

854
01:29:03,538 --> 01:29:05,739
You're in terrible danger, girl!

855
01:29:05,740 --> 01:29:08,408
But how? I locked the door!

856
01:29:08,409 --> 01:29:11,409
It's the key, miss.
There's only one, and the beldam will find it.

857
01:29:14,182 --> 01:29:17,017
'Tain't all bad, miss.

858
01:29:17,018 --> 01:29:20,018
Thou art alive. Thou art still living.

859
01:29:32,633 --> 01:29:35,633
I gotta hide this somewhere,
somewhere she can never...

860
01:29:44,078 --> 01:29:47,078
Out of my way!

861
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:03,895
Oh, my twitchy-witchy girl

862
01:30:04,399 --> 01:30:06,400
I think you are so nice

863
01:30:06,401 --> 01:30:09,401
I give you bowls ofporridge
and I give you bowls of ice cream

864
01:30:13,307 --> 01:30:16,307
I give you lots of kisses

865
01:30:17,445 --> 01:30:20,445
And I give you lots of hugs

866
01:30:20,548 --> 01:30:22,849
But I never give you sandwiches

867
01:30:22,850 --> 01:30:25,419
With grease and worms and mung...

868
01:30:26,587 --> 01:30:29,587
...beans

869
01:31:59,247 --> 01:32:02,247
I'm really sorry I didn't believe you
about all this evil stuff, Coraline.

870
01:32:06,120 --> 01:32:08,221
Why did you change your mind?

871
01:32:08,222 --> 01:32:11,222
Well, Grandma showed me this picture
after I called you crazy.

872
01:32:13,427 --> 01:32:16,427
It's her and her sister,
before she disappeared.

873
01:32:16,731 --> 01:32:18,665
The Sweet Ghost Girl.

874
01:32:18,666 --> 01:32:21,666
Wyborne! Come home!

875
01:32:23,471 --> 01:32:26,471
Oh, man. What am I gonna tell her?

876
01:32:27,208 --> 01:32:30,208
Just bring her by the house tomorrow.
We can tell her together.

877
01:32:31,979 --> 01:32:34,447
We... We can?

878
01:32:34,448 --> 01:32:37,448
You know, I'm glad you decided to stalk me.

879
01:32:39,921 --> 01:32:41,087
It wasn't my idea.

880
01:33:07,381 --> 01:33:10,350
Thanks for helping me,
Miss Spink, Miss Forcible.

881
01:33:10,351 --> 01:33:13,351
Oh, look, April. Pink ladies!

882
01:33:13,854 --> 01:33:16,854
Actually, it's just lemonade.
How's Angus doing?

883
01:33:17,391 --> 01:33:20,391
Oh, much better, dear,
but he can't duck his wings forever.

884
01:33:22,496 --> 01:33:23,597
Here comes a burp.

885
01:33:24,665 --> 01:33:25,765
Charlie!

886
01:33:25,766 --> 01:33:28,766
Excusez-moi, but that pizza,
that was delicious.

887
01:33:30,504 --> 01:33:32,806
-Cold drinks?
-Oh, yeah. Great.

888
01:33:32,807 --> 01:33:35,807
You were right, Coraline. I really hate dirt!

889
01:33:37,011 --> 01:33:39,879
But the tulips look nice.

890
01:33:39,880 --> 01:33:42,880
Thanks, Mom.

891
01:33:46,887 --> 01:33:48,321
That is possible.

892
01:33:50,958 --> 01:33:53,093
How are the mooshkas, Mr. B?

893
01:33:53,094 --> 01:33:56,094
They tell me that you are savior, Caroline.

894
01:33:56,497 --> 01:33:58,198
And soon as they are ready,

895
01:33:58,199 --> 01:34:01,199
they wish to give
special thanks you performance.

896
01:34:01,669 --> 01:34:04,669
Wyborne, I know where I'm going.

897
01:34:05,806 --> 01:34:07,674
I grew up here.

898
01:34:07,675 --> 01:34:10,343
Welcome, Miss Lovat!

899
01:34:10,344 --> 01:34:13,344
Oh. Hello.

900
01:34:14,015 --> 01:34:17,015
I'm Coraline Jones.
I've got so much to tell you.

901
01:34:17,685 --> 01:34:20,086
Here.
Thanks.

902
01:34:20,087 --> 01:34:22,222
Do you want to pop
a little gin in it, dear?

903
01:34:22,223 --> 01:34:25,223
Of course.
