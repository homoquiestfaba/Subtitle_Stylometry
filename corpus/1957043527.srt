1
00:01:42,992 --> 00:01:47,587
What is this item here?

2
00:01:47,617 --> 00:01:49,170
That's, uh...

3
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:51,295
You know, like, uh,

4
00:01:51,325 --> 00:01:53,629
Like a write-off.

5
00:01:53,659 --> 00:01:55,504
know.

6
00:01:55,534 --> 00:01:57,253
Uh... does it say marijuana?

7
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:58,712
Yeah.

8
00:01:58,742 --> 00:01:59,712
But i'm a painter,

9
00:01:59,742 --> 00:02:03,712
And i use it for, like...

10
00:02:03,742 --> 00:02:05,545
Inspiration.

11
00:02:05,575 --> 00:02:07,504
Inspiration and shit.

12
00:02:07,534 --> 00:02:09,796
Okay, you're

13
00:02:09,826 --> 00:02:11,253
A housepainter, brad.

14
00:02:11,283 --> 00:02:14,379
Yeah, but honestly, i paint

15
00:02:14,409 --> 00:02:15,671
Like, so much better

16
00:02:15,701 --> 00:02:17,212
When i'm baked.

17
00:02:17,242 --> 00:02:18,504
But you do realize that

18
00:02:18,534 --> 00:02:20,545
Marijuana is illegal?

19
00:02:20,575 --> 00:02:23,295
No. no, it's not.

20
00:02:23,325 --> 00:02:26,962
I have a medical card thing.

21
00:02:26,992 --> 00:02:28,253
Oh, a prescription.

22
00:02:28,283 --> 00:02:30,170
Okay, for what?

23
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:33,587
have no peripheral vision.

24
00:02:33,617 --> 00:02:36,462
Can't even see her.

25
00:02:36,492 --> 00:02:38,962
Yeah, okay.

26
00:02:38,992 --> 00:02:42,088
Um, okay, maybe i can find a way

27
00:02:42,118 --> 00:02:43,504
To deduct some of it as

28
00:02:43,534 --> 00:02:45,337
An uninsured medical expense.

29
00:02:45,367 --> 00:02:47,129
But honestly, compared to--

30
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:50,129
What if we wrote it off

31
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:52,504
As a cost of good soul thing?

32
00:02:52,534 --> 00:02:54,129
What are you talking about?

33
00:02:54,159 --> 00:02:56,462
You know, for...

34
00:02:56,492 --> 00:02:58,129
For the stuff we bought to sell

35
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,337
And not smoke ourselves.

36
00:03:01,367 --> 00:03:03,088
Smoke ourselves.

37
00:03:03,118 --> 00:03:04,879
Would that help?

38
00:03:04,909 --> 00:03:06,504
No, brad, it wouldn't.

39
00:03:06,534 --> 00:03:09,504
Hey, there's one more thing.

40
00:03:09,534 --> 00:03:11,004
What is it, brad?

41
00:03:11,034 --> 00:03:12,129
Someone else is scheduled for

42
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:13,129
The room.

43
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:14,379
Okay, look. we know you got

44
00:03:14,409 --> 00:03:16,170
A flat fee, but we don't got

45
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:18,253
That kind of cash right now.

46
00:03:18,283 --> 00:03:19,379
But we can pay you with part

47
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:21,379
Of this.

48
00:03:21,409 --> 00:03:23,379
What is that?

49
00:03:23,409 --> 00:03:24,921
It's the finest lebanese

50
00:03:24,951 --> 00:03:26,253
Blonde, baby.

51
00:03:26,283 --> 00:03:28,170
What?

52
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,504
It's hash.

53
00:03:30,534 --> 00:03:31,962
know it's hash.

54
00:03:31,992 --> 00:03:33,379
Hi, guys. you're overtime.

55
00:03:33,409 --> 00:03:35,420
Hey, mick. hey, we are just

56
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:37,170
Finishing up.

57
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,088
Mm-hmm.

58
00:03:41,118 --> 00:03:42,879
Your friend's cute.

59
00:03:42,909 --> 00:03:44,379
Is she single?

60
00:03:44,409 --> 00:03:47,088
No, she's engaged.

61
00:03:47,118 --> 00:03:49,170
Sucks.

62
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:51,671
The desk. yes.

63
00:03:51,701 --> 00:03:52,921
just get so nervous when

64
00:03:52,951 --> 00:03:54,671
I keep the fuzz waiting.

65
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:56,921
Right...

66
00:03:56,951 --> 00:04:00,712
That... that's your client?

67
00:04:00,742 --> 00:04:02,379
Mm-hmm.

68
00:04:02,409 --> 00:04:04,129
Hey, thank you so much.

69
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:05,629
Don't forget to take...

70
00:04:05,659 --> 00:04:07,253
Thanks.

71
00:04:07,283 --> 00:04:08,712
Imagine how frustrated he'll

72
00:04:08,742 --> 00:04:09,921
Be when he finds out that

73
00:04:09,951 --> 00:04:11,759
Doughnuts are an exemption.

74
00:04:12,867 --> 00:04:16,367
Chop-chop. yeah, okay.

75
00:04:21,826 --> 00:04:23,337
Need me to call you a cab?

76
00:04:23,367 --> 00:04:24,545
No, it's okay, it's okay.

77
00:04:24,575 --> 00:04:28,659
My roommate's picking me up.

78
00:04:36,367 --> 00:04:37,504
Recorded voice:

79
00:04:37,534 --> 00:04:38,629
the subscriber you are trying

80
00:04:38,659 --> 00:04:40,129
to reach is not accepting calls

81
00:04:40,159 --> 00:04:41,545
at this time.

82
00:04:41,575 --> 00:04:44,367
Oh, fuck.

83
00:04:52,701 --> 00:04:54,462
Hi, honey, you're home.

84
00:04:54,492 --> 00:04:55,462
Hey, kris.

85
00:04:55,492 --> 00:04:57,545
Where were you?

86
00:04:57,575 --> 00:04:58,545
pick you up on thursday

87
00:04:58,575 --> 00:05:01,129
Nights, right?

88
00:05:01,159 --> 00:05:02,712
Today is thursday, tara.

89
00:05:02,742 --> 00:05:04,337
Shit. with the restaurant

90
00:05:04,367 --> 00:05:06,337
Being closed, i totally lost

91
00:05:06,367 --> 00:05:07,587
Track of what day of the week

92
00:05:07,617 --> 00:05:08,796
It was.

93
00:05:08,826 --> 00:05:10,462
How'd you get home?

94
00:05:10,492 --> 00:05:12,420
The bus. the fucking bus.

95
00:05:12,450 --> 00:05:14,129
Eww. oh, my god.

96
00:05:14,159 --> 00:05:15,295
Why didn't you just--

97
00:05:15,325 --> 00:05:16,337
Call you? i did.

98
00:05:16,367 --> 00:05:17,337
Your cell phone's been cut off.

99
00:05:17,367 --> 00:05:18,337
Which is funny, because i

100
00:05:18,367 --> 00:05:20,337
Remember giving you money

101
00:05:20,367 --> 00:05:22,504
Last week to pay your cell bill.

102
00:05:22,534 --> 00:05:23,504
can totally explain.

103
00:05:23,534 --> 00:05:26,576
Right. kris. honey?

104
00:05:29,909 --> 00:05:31,545
Fuck!

105
00:05:31,575 --> 00:05:34,629
Yikes.

106
00:05:34,659 --> 00:05:37,295
Hi.

107
00:05:37,325 --> 00:05:39,879
I brought you a martini.

108
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:42,921
Here.

109
00:05:42,951 --> 00:05:44,909
No?

110
00:05:48,575 --> 00:05:51,671
Oh, my god.

111
00:05:51,701 --> 00:05:53,545
You won't believe the mess that

112
00:05:53,575 --> 00:05:54,754
Sammi's got herself into

113
00:05:54,784 --> 00:05:56,754
This time.

114
00:05:56,784 --> 00:05:59,129
It either involves men

115
00:05:59,159 --> 00:06:01,879
Or money, and, oh, wait, let

116
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:02,879
Me guess; it's not her fault.

117
00:06:02,909 --> 00:06:04,170
Am i right?

118
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:05,420
Come on, kris, she's not

119
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,962
That bad.

120
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:08,170
Not that bad? that bitch

121
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:10,170
Is a fucking disaster.

122
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:11,295
If we didn't need her help to

123
00:06:11,325 --> 00:06:12,504
Pay rent, i'd have kicked her

124
00:06:12,534 --> 00:06:14,671
Ass to the curb months ago.

125
00:06:14,701 --> 00:06:16,212
' M sorry i didn't pick you

126
00:06:16,242 --> 00:06:17,462
Up, kris.

127
00:06:17,492 --> 00:06:18,462
I thought i had more time on

128
00:06:18,492 --> 00:06:19,504
The phone.

129
00:06:19,534 --> 00:06:20,504
Yeah, what happened to the

130
00:06:20,534 --> 00:06:22,004
Phone money, tara?

131
00:06:22,034 --> 00:06:23,671
I could've fixed my car.

132
00:06:23,701 --> 00:06:25,754
know. i used it...

133
00:06:25,784 --> 00:06:28,129
To buy this.

134
00:06:28,159 --> 00:06:30,462
It's a lacoste.

135
00:06:30,492 --> 00:06:32,088
Another knife?

136
00:06:32,118 --> 00:06:33,462
Not just another knife.

137
00:06:33,492 --> 00:06:35,921
It completes my set.

138
00:06:35,951 --> 00:06:37,837
How's a chef supposed to get

139
00:06:37,867 --> 00:06:39,921
A better job without a full set?

140
00:06:39,951 --> 00:06:42,004
How's a chef supposed to get

141
00:06:42,034 --> 00:06:43,212
Another job if no one can

142
00:06:43,242 --> 00:06:45,587
Fucking call her?

143
00:06:45,617 --> 00:06:46,587
was gonna put it on my

144
00:06:46,617 --> 00:06:48,337
Card, and then it was overdrawn.

145
00:06:48,367 --> 00:06:49,796
Tara, you know what?

146
00:06:49,826 --> 00:06:51,212
You're my princess.

147
00:06:51,242 --> 00:06:52,754
All right, you know this.

148
00:06:52,784 --> 00:06:53,754
But i'm not your rich father,

149
00:06:53,784 --> 00:06:54,754
And i can't afford to keep

150
00:06:54,784 --> 00:06:55,754
Bailing you out.

151
00:06:55,784 --> 00:06:56,837
Kris, i don't care about

152
00:06:56,867 --> 00:06:58,129
That stuff; none of that stuff

153
00:06:58,159 --> 00:06:59,754
Matters to me.

154
00:06:59,784 --> 00:07:01,046
I'd be happy in a shack in the

155
00:07:01,076 --> 00:07:02,837
Middle of nowhere with you.

156
00:07:02,867 --> 00:07:04,337
Right. well, i've been there,

157
00:07:04,367 --> 00:07:07,253
And trust me, you wouldn't last.

158
00:07:07,283 --> 00:07:10,129
You'd just find someone like

159
00:07:10,159 --> 00:07:12,879
Sammi to go bar-hopping with.

160
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:16,587
Is that what this is about?

161
00:07:16,617 --> 00:07:17,796
You're pretty sexy when

162
00:07:17,826 --> 00:07:19,962
You're jealous, kris.

163
00:07:19,992 --> 00:07:21,295
' M not jealous.

164
00:07:21,325 --> 00:07:23,004
I'm not jealous.

165
00:07:23,034 --> 00:07:26,170
I'm just tired.

166
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:28,712
Oh. i know a good way to

167
00:07:28,742 --> 00:07:30,879
Relax you.

168
00:07:30,909 --> 00:07:31,962
Tara, stop it.

169
00:07:31,992 --> 00:07:34,587
I told you i'm tired.

170
00:07:34,617 --> 00:07:35,754
What if i put on the george

171
00:07:35,784 --> 00:07:37,587
Michael mix?

172
00:07:37,617 --> 00:07:39,170
No.

173
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:41,629
What if i put on the judas

174
00:07:41,659 --> 00:07:44,295
Priest mix...

175
00:07:44,325 --> 00:07:46,671
And i let you tie me up?

176
00:07:46,701 --> 00:07:47,837
' M just gonna get some

177
00:07:47,867 --> 00:07:49,700
Sleep.

178
00:07:54,826 --> 00:07:57,837
' M not tired, so...

179
00:07:57,867 --> 00:08:00,046
I'm gonna go back out there.

180
00:08:00,076 --> 00:08:01,587
I mean, if i can't get laid,

181
00:08:01,617 --> 00:08:02,587
I might as well get drunk,

182
00:08:02,617 --> 00:08:05,825
Right?

183
00:08:07,034 --> 00:08:09,427
Love you.

184
00:08:18,909 --> 00:08:21,801
Love you, too.

185
00:08:23,909 --> 00:08:27,088
Kris is so pissed at me.

186
00:08:27,118 --> 00:08:29,921
What? she just left you

187
00:08:29,951 --> 00:08:31,754
Like that?

188
00:08:31,784 --> 00:08:34,837
All horny and hard up?

189
00:08:34,867 --> 00:08:36,587
Yeah. she said it's tax

190
00:08:36,617 --> 00:08:38,170
Season.

191
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:40,921
Oh, right.

192
00:08:40,951 --> 00:08:43,921
Well, you know, i may be

193
00:08:43,951 --> 00:08:46,837
Straight, but i can tell when

194

Morning, sammi.

196
00:09:19,283 --> 00:09:20,837
Hey, a question for you.

197
00:09:20,867 --> 00:09:23,837
Whoa! fuck! what the fuck, karl?

00:09:23,867 --> 00:09:24,921
What's up with you bitches

Good morning to you, too.

204
00:09:32,659 --> 00:09:33,629
I don't understand why, if

205
00:09:33,659 --> 00:09:34,754
You're into chicks anyway,

206
00:09:34,784 --> 00:09:35,754
You get so uptight about me

207
00:09:35,784 --> 00:09:36,754
Being natural.

208
00:09:36,784 --> 00:09:37,754
don't care if you

209
00:09:37,784 --> 00:09:38,879
Understand or not, karl.

210
00:09:38,909 --> 00:09:39,879
When you're in my house, wear

211
00:09:39,909 --> 00:09:41,253

00:09:41,283 --> 00:09:44,253

What?

218
00:09:53,283 --> 00:09:54,712
Being naked's the most

219
00:09:54,742 --> 00:09:56,671
Natural thing in the world.

220
00:09:56,701 --> 00:09:57,796
In fact, in other countries,

221
00:09:57,826 --> 00:09:59,295
Like europe, they don't get all

222
00:09:59,325 --> 00:10:00,587

Shot? it's a peace offering.

226
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,088
Question for you.

00:10:11,118 --> 00:10:14,004
Oh, god, here it comes.

00:10:14,034 --> 00:10:15,212
No, for reals.

229
00:10:15,242 --> 00:10:16,962
What are you planning on doing

230
00:10:16,992 --> 00:10:18,212
With that big old brick of hash

231
00:10:18,242 --> 00:10:19,212
In your bag?

232
00:10:19,242 --> 00:10:20,212
How the fuck did you know

233
00:10:20,242 --> 00:10:21,253

234
00:10:21,283 --> 00:10:22,253

235
00:10:22,283 --> 00:10:23,587
A mile away.

And sell it on the street

333
00:14:13,617 --> 00:14:14,587

Why are those canadian dollars?

386
00:16:49,992 --> 00:16:51,088
They call 'em loonies up

387
00:16:51,118 --> 00:16:52,712
There.

388
00:16:52,742 --> 00:16:54,420
Oh, my god.

389
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:56,545
Tara, what did you do?

390
00:16:56,575 --> 00:16:57,796
Tara:okay, we were in this

391
00:16:57,826 --> 00:16:59,712
really shitty part of town--

392
00:16:59,742 --> 00:17:00,921
Sammi:it wasn't that shitty.

393
00:17:00,951 --> 00:17:02,088
it was pretty fuckin' shitty.

394
00:17:02,118 --> 00:17:03,545
anyway, sammi needed a ride

395
00:17:03,575 --> 00:17:04,837
home, so i picked her up, and

396
00:17:04,867 --> 00:17:05,837
she invited me to this rave,

397
00:17:05,867 --> 00:17:06,837
and i was, like,

398
00:17:06,867 --> 00:17:07,837
Kris:a rave?

399
00:17:07,867 --> 00:17:09,088
I know, i know, but just

400
00:17:09,118 --> 00:17:10,420
listen, okay?

401
00:17:10,450 --> 00:17:11,587
we must have gotten the

402
00:17:11,617 --> 00:17:12,712
directions wrong, because we

403
00:17:12,742 --> 00:17:16,504
found this instead.

404
00:17:16,534 --> 00:17:20,409
Holy shit!

405
00:17:22,909 --> 00:17:24,088
How do you know they were

406
00:17:24,118 --> 00:17:25,587
All dead?

407
00:17:25,617 --> 00:17:27,046
had to work in the abattoir

408
00:17:27,076 --> 00:17:28,129
As part of my culinary training.

409
00:17:28,159 --> 00:17:29,587
Trust me, i know what dead

410
00:17:29,617 --> 00:17:31,170
Looks like.

411
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,420
don't know about this.

412
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:34,004
I don't know what to say.

413
00:17:34,034 --> 00:17:35,587
Say "thank you, god, for

414
00:17:35,617 --> 00:17:37,420
Delivering us a miracle."

415
00:17:37,450 --> 00:17:38,879
Think about it, kris.

416
00:17:38,909 --> 00:17:40,962
This is the answer to every

417
00:17:40,992 --> 00:17:42,712
Prayer we've ever had.

418
00:17:42,742 --> 00:17:46,129
Let's just hope so.

419
00:17:46,159 --> 00:17:47,796
How much do you think

420
00:17:47,826 --> 00:17:50,921
All of this is?

421
00:17:50,951 --> 00:17:52,129
Okay, at the current exchange

422
00:17:52,159 --> 00:17:56,212
Rate, that is about 3.1 million

423
00:17:56,242 --> 00:17:58,343
American dollars, give or take.

424
00:18:00,325 --> 00:18:01,712
Wait, hold on.

425
00:18:01,742 --> 00:18:03,046
There's, like, a fake bottom

426
00:18:03,076 --> 00:18:04,671
In this.

427
00:18:04,701 --> 00:18:07,504
Ho! oh, my god! what?

428
00:18:07,534 --> 00:18:09,879
Oh, yeah, it's a gun!

429
00:18:09,909 --> 00:18:11,337
Jesus, sammi, sammi.

430
00:18:11,367 --> 00:18:12,379
What?

431
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:13,671
Be careful with that.

432
00:18:13,701 --> 00:18:14,754
Do either of you know anything

433
00:18:14,784 --> 00:18:15,754
About guns?

434
00:18:15,784 --> 00:18:16,921
Uh, yeah, of course.

435
00:18:16,951 --> 00:18:18,212
I know they're fucking cool

436
00:18:18,242 --> 00:18:19,379
As shit.

437
00:18:19,409 --> 00:18:20,712
Okay, then no one touch it.

438
00:18:20,742 --> 00:18:21,962
I don't want one of you to shoot

439
00:18:21,992 --> 00:18:23,462
Yourself in the face.

440
00:18:23,492 --> 00:18:25,212
Okay, here's what we do.

441
00:18:25,242 --> 00:18:27,379
We go to mexico, obviously,

442
00:18:27,409 --> 00:18:28,587
And we spend the rest of our

443
00:18:28,617 --> 00:18:29,921
Lives gettin' tan, drinkin'

444
00:18:29,951 --> 00:18:32,837
Margaritas and learning mexican.

445
00:18:32,867 --> 00:18:33,962
Sammi, we cannot cross the

446
00:18:33,992 --> 00:18:35,004
Border with a suitcase full of

447
00:18:35,034 --> 00:18:36,004
Money.

448
00:18:36,034 --> 00:18:37,046
Uh, why the fuck not?

449
00:18:37,076 --> 00:18:38,379
I've been to tijuana.

450
00:18:38,409 --> 00:18:39,420
They don't give a shit what you

451
00:18:39,450 --> 00:18:40,462
Bring in to mexico.

452
00:18:40,492 --> 00:18:41,545
Maybe, but if you're wrong,

453
00:18:41,575 --> 00:18:42,879
Then we go to prison.

454
00:18:42,909 --> 00:18:44,004
You have any idea what it's like

455
00:18:44,034 --> 00:18:45,004
In a mexican prison?

456
00:18:45,034 --> 00:18:46,587
No. uh-uh.

457
00:18:46,617 --> 00:18:48,088
All right, so what do we do?

458
00:18:48,118 --> 00:18:49,629
Honestly, i think we should

459
00:18:49,659 --> 00:18:50,712
Take it back.

460
00:18:50,742 --> 00:18:51,962
Back? what, no. are you

461
00:18:51,992 --> 00:18:53,046
Fucking insane?

462
00:18:53,076 --> 00:18:54,796
I am so sick and tired of people

463
00:18:54,826 --> 00:18:56,046
Buying me shit because i have

464
00:18:56,076 --> 00:18:57,379
Huge tits.

465
00:18:57,409 --> 00:18:58,671
Yes, they're awesome tits, but

466
00:18:58,701 --> 00:18:59,921
I wanna buy my own shit

467
00:18:59,951 --> 00:19:01,671
For a change.

468
00:19:01,701 --> 00:19:02,712
Now i can.

469
00:19:02,742 --> 00:19:03,879
Do you understand what that

470
00:19:03,909 --> 00:19:04,962
Does for me?

471
00:19:04,992 --> 00:19:06,046
Has it not occurred to you

472
00:19:06,076 --> 00:19:07,046
That someone out there is

473
00:19:07,076 --> 00:19:08,420
Looking for this money right

474
00:19:08,450 --> 00:19:09,545
Now?

475
00:19:09,575 --> 00:19:10,712
You mean like the police?

476
00:19:10,742 --> 00:19:11,754
mean like the homicidal

477
00:19:11,784 --> 00:19:12,837
Drug dealer you bitches stole

478
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:13,837
It from.

479
00:19:13,867 --> 00:19:14,879
Stop saying that.

480
00:19:14,909 --> 00:19:15,921
We don't know that they were

481
00:19:15,951 --> 00:19:16,921
Homicidal drug dealers or

482
00:19:16,951 --> 00:19:17,962
Whatever, and you know what?

483
00:19:17,992 --> 00:19:18,962
We didn't steal anything.

484
00:19:18,992 --> 00:19:20,129
They were dead.

485
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,170
Are you not listening to

486
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:22,545
Anything i am fucking saying?

487
00:19:22,575 --> 00:19:23,545
Even if every person in that

488
00:19:23,575 --> 00:19:25,754
Warehouse was dead, there are

489
00:19:25,784 --> 00:19:27,545
Going to be dozens more out

490
00:19:27,575 --> 00:19:28,796
Combing the earth looking for

491
00:19:28,826 --> 00:19:29,921
This cash right now.

492
00:19:29,951 --> 00:19:31,129
And then there's the police.

493
00:19:31,159 --> 00:19:32,462
Fuck, god only knows how much

494
00:19:32,492 --> 00:19:33,462
Evidence you two left in that

495
00:19:33,492 --> 00:19:34,629
Warehouse.

496
00:19:34,659 --> 00:19:35,629
No, i told you, we were

497
00:19:35,659 --> 00:19:36,629
Really careful.

498
00:19:36,659 --> 00:19:37,629
Careful? give me a break.

499
00:19:37,659 --> 00:19:38,629
A fucking drug dog could

500
00:19:38,659 --> 00:19:39,879
Probably sniff sammi's perfume

501
00:19:39,909 --> 00:19:41,420
To our front door.

502
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,712
Right, like i'm the only girl

503
00:19:42,742 --> 00:19:44,046
In this town who wears paris

504
00:19:44,076 --> 00:19:45,088
Hilton's "tease."

505
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:46,462
Fuck, i wish that were true.

506
00:19:46,492 --> 00:19:47,587
If what you're saying is

507
00:19:47,617 --> 00:19:48,712
True, then we should definitely

508
00:19:48,742 --> 00:19:50,046
Not take it back, because there

509
00:19:50,076 --> 00:19:51,796
Will either be, like, police,

510
00:19:51,826 --> 00:19:53,462
Or evil drug dealer killers.

511
00:19:53,492 --> 00:19:54,962
Yeah, okay, you're right.

512
00:19:54,992 --> 00:19:56,671
We can't take it back.

513
00:19:56,701 --> 00:19:57,879
got it.

514
00:19:57,909 --> 00:19:59,337
We hide the money.

515
00:19:59,367 --> 00:20:00,712
We put it away, we see if anyone

516
00:20:00,742 --> 00:20:01,921
Comes, if anyone comes,

517
00:20:01,951 --> 00:20:04,295
We play dumb, and if they don't,

518
00:20:04,325 --> 00:20:05,587
We go back, we get it,

519
00:20:05,617 --> 00:20:07,504
And we have it.

520
00:20:07,534 --> 00:20:08,712
We can't hide it somewheres

521
00:20:08,742 --> 00:20:09,921
Safe, okay?

522
00:20:09,951 --> 00:20:10,962
What if one of us decides to go

523
00:20:10,992 --> 00:20:12,295
Back and take the money, and

524
00:20:12,325 --> 00:20:13,796
Then we're all just screwed.

525
00:20:13,826 --> 00:20:14,962
Oh, come on.

526
00:20:14,992 --> 00:20:16,046
Wait a minute, sammi's right.

527
00:20:16,076 --> 00:20:17,462
Sammi's right?! i--

528
00:20:17,492 --> 00:20:18,587
Wait a second. we have to

529
00:20:18,617 --> 00:20:19,754
Find somewhere that we can put

530
00:20:19,784 --> 00:20:21,337
The money where no one else

531
00:20:21,367 --> 00:20:22,462
Can get to it without the

532
00:20:22,492 --> 00:20:23,587
Other two.

533
00:20:23,617 --> 00:20:24,712
You don't trust me?

534
00:20:24,742 --> 00:20:26,295
don't trust her.

535
00:20:26,325 --> 00:20:28,712
Ah, right back atcha, hon.

536
00:20:28,742 --> 00:20:30,295
Okay, so here's what we

537
00:20:30,325 --> 00:20:31,754
Can do.

538
00:20:31,784 --> 00:20:32,962
I'll spend the next week

539
00:20:32,992 --> 00:20:33,962
Figuring out how to get the

540
00:20:33,992 --> 00:20:35,504
Money out of the country.

541
00:20:35,534 --> 00:20:36,837
We put three locks on the door,

542
00:20:36,867 --> 00:20:37,879
One for each of us, and wait.

543
00:20:37,909 --> 00:20:39,379
When it seems like it's safe,

544
00:20:39,409 --> 00:20:40,796
We'll all go back and get it

545
00:20:40,826 --> 00:20:42,587
Together.

546
00:20:42,617 --> 00:20:43,754
Tara: sounds good to me.

547
00:20:43,784 --> 00:20:45,046
Kris: sammi?

548
00:20:45,076 --> 00:20:47,093
Sammi: whatever.

549
00:21:05,701 --> 00:21:07,545
What up, bitch?

550
00:21:07,575 --> 00:21:09,379
Hey.

551
00:21:09,409 --> 00:21:11,420
Why are you always so chipper?

552
00:21:11,450 --> 00:21:12,629
I heard you and karl going at it

553
00:21:12,659 --> 00:21:13,837
Till 5:00 in the morning

554
00:21:13,867 --> 00:21:15,337
Last night.

555
00:21:15,367 --> 00:21:16,796
Adderall. want some?

556
00:21:16,826 --> 00:21:17,837
No. kris doesn't like it

557
00:21:17,867 --> 00:21:19,629
When i take drugs.

558
00:21:19,659 --> 00:21:20,796
They're not drugs.

559
00:21:20,826 --> 00:21:22,295
They're prescription.

560
00:21:22,325 --> 00:21:23,962
Oh. your prescription?

561
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:26,379
Someone's.

562
00:21:26,409 --> 00:21:27,379
Whatever.

563
00:21:27,409 --> 00:21:28,462
I don't understand how you can

564
00:21:28,492 --> 00:21:29,754
Be with someone who's so

565
00:21:29,784 --> 00:21:31,129
Controlling.

566
00:21:31,159 --> 00:21:32,837
Because i love her,

567
00:21:32,867 --> 00:21:34,337
And the angry ferret that seems

568
00:21:34,367 --> 00:21:35,587
To have crawled up her ass

569
00:21:35,617 --> 00:21:36,587
Recently.

570
00:21:36,617 --> 00:21:39,212
ferret? i knew a guy

571
00:21:39,242 --> 00:21:42,170
Who could do that with hamsters.

572
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:45,295
It was really hot.

573
00:21:45,325 --> 00:21:46,837
What are you doing?

574
00:21:46,867 --> 00:21:48,212
Pay attention to me.

575
00:21:48,242 --> 00:21:49,754
Stop. i'm trying to balance

576
00:21:49,784 --> 00:21:51,004
My checkbook.

577
00:21:51,034 --> 00:21:53,587
It's not working for shit.

578
00:21:53,617 --> 00:21:55,212
All right, fine.

579
00:21:55,242 --> 00:21:57,129
Look, if you're not too busy

580
00:21:57,159 --> 00:21:59,088
Figuring out e=mc2, do you think

581
00:21:59,118 --> 00:22:00,170
Maybe you can pick me up

582
00:22:00,200 --> 00:22:01,504
After work?

583
00:22:01,534 --> 00:22:03,004

00:22:03,034 --> 00:22:04,337

585
00:22:04,367 --> 00:22:06,046
To do, and then...

586
00:22:06,076 --> 00:22:07,170
Kris doesn't like it when i'm

587
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:08,504
Out late.

588
00:22:08,534 --> 00:22:10,504
Oh, my god!

589
00:22:10,534 --> 00:22:12,921
Um, is she your girlfriend or

590
00:22:12,951 --> 00:22:15,253
Is she your mommy?

591
00:22:15,283 --> 00:22:16,504
Why don't you ask karl?

592
00:22:16,534 --> 00:22:18,004
would, but he's got

593
00:22:18,034 --> 00:22:19,504
A gig tonight.

594
00:22:19,534 --> 00:22:20,837
He's playing over at some

595
00:22:20,867 --> 00:22:22,253
High school keg party.

596
00:22:22,283 --> 00:22:23,253
And you have the nerve to

597
00:22:23,283 --> 00:22:24,504
Give me shit about kris?

598
00:22:24,534 --> 00:22:26,337
Why are you with that loser?

599
00:22:26,367 --> 00:22:28,837
Look, he's, like, a...

600
00:22:28,867 --> 00:22:31,088
He's like a classic car.

601
00:22:31,118 --> 00:22:33,337
You know, he doesn't always work

602
00:22:33,367 --> 00:22:35,170
When you want it to, but it's

603
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:36,837
Super sexy, so you drive it

604
00:22:36,867 --> 00:22:39,504
Anyway, and, let me tell you,

605
00:22:39,534 --> 00:22:42,129
He knows how to drive.

606
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:44,337
Ugh! please. stop.

607
00:22:44,367 --> 00:22:46,004
Your breeder sex stories

608
00:22:46,034 --> 00:22:47,253
Are making me nauseous.

609
00:22:47,283 --> 00:22:49,253
Whatever. look, i'm working

610
00:22:49,283 --> 00:22:50,337
The early shift, so i'll get off

611
00:22:50,367 --> 00:22:51,879
By 11:00, and i'll pay you

612
00:22:51,909 --> 00:22:53,295
The 20 bucks it would cost for

613
00:22:53,325 --> 00:22:55,545
A cab, but they just smell so

614
00:22:55,575 --> 00:22:57,712
Bad, and i feel like i'm walking

615
00:22:57,742 --> 00:22:59,170
Inside of an std.

616
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:00,462
Please!

617
00:23:00,492 --> 00:23:02,170
Fine. i can't believe i'm

618
00:23:02,200 --> 00:23:03,837
So fucking broke that i'm

619
00:23:03,867 --> 00:23:04,962
Picking you up from work

620
00:23:04,992 --> 00:23:06,212
For money.

621
00:23:06,242 --> 00:23:08,879
Just don't tell kris.

622
00:23:08,909 --> 00:23:10,754
She's jealous of you for reasons

623
00:23:10,784 --> 00:23:12,170
I cannot comprehend.

624
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,837
Oh, there are reasons.

625
00:23:14,867 --> 00:23:17,088
All this is a reason.

626
00:23:17,118 --> 00:23:20,295
Ew! you're so nasty.

627
00:23:20,325 --> 00:23:22,046
All righty. have a rockin'

628
00:23:22,076 --> 00:23:27,004
Time, old people.

629
00:23:27,034 --> 00:23:29,004
When do you get off tonight?

630
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:30,962
Whenever you bend over.

631
00:23:30,992 --> 00:23:34,170
My band's got a gig tonight,

632
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,170
So don't wait up for me, babe.

633
00:23:36,200 --> 00:23:37,837
Remember, no means no.

634
00:23:37,867 --> 00:23:43,201
What up, bitch?

635
00:23:46,909 --> 00:23:48,879
Hey, one of these days,

636
00:23:48,909 --> 00:23:49,879
You're gonna have to explain to

637
00:23:49,909 --> 00:23:52,004
Me why eve wears a bob.

638
00:23:52,034 --> 00:23:54,212
How was your night?

639
00:23:54,242 --> 00:23:56,088
Ugh. if you promise not to

640
00:23:56,118 --> 00:23:57,212
Ask me about it again, i'll

641
00:23:57,242 --> 00:23:58,712
Share this $1,000 bottle of wine

642
00:23:58,742 --> 00:23:59,962
With you.

643
00:23:59,992 --> 00:24:01,212
Seriously? fuck, yeah.

644
00:24:01,242 --> 00:24:04,671
Give me that.

645
00:24:04,701 --> 00:24:07,004
Okay, so tell me again why

646
00:24:07,034 --> 00:24:08,796
Is it that we're drinking

647
00:24:08,826 --> 00:24:11,754
A $1,000 bottle of vino.

648
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:12,962
We agreed not to talk

649
00:24:12,992 --> 00:24:14,004
About that.

650
00:24:14,034 --> 00:24:15,129
Right. sorry.

651
00:24:15,159 --> 00:24:16,712
I just, i don't know,

652
00:24:16,742 --> 00:24:17,837
I don't understand why you're

653
00:24:17,867 --> 00:24:19,754
Not, like, saving it to drink

654
00:24:19,784 --> 00:24:22,004
With your girlfriend kris.

655
00:24:22,034 --> 00:24:23,295
Because kris is asleep

656
00:24:23,325 --> 00:24:26,129
Already, and i need alcohol now.

657
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:28,253
Oh, well, in that case,

658
00:24:28,283 --> 00:24:29,837
I've got something convenient.

659
00:24:29,867 --> 00:24:32,295
I was just invited to a rave.

660
00:24:32,325 --> 00:24:33,712
Wanna come with?

661
00:24:33,742 --> 00:24:34,837
rave?

662
00:24:34,867 --> 00:24:36,004
Yeah. kris is already asleep,

663
00:24:36,034 --> 00:24:37,879
So what are you gonna do?

664
00:24:37,909 --> 00:24:40,712
Fine. fuck it. where is it?

665
00:24:40,742 --> 00:24:43,088
Mmm... warehouse district.

666
00:24:43,118 --> 00:24:44,837
I don't really know the exact

667
00:24:44,867 --> 00:24:46,253
Address, but, you know, we can

668
00:24:46,283 --> 00:24:48,004
Figure it out when we get there.

669
00:24:48,034 --> 00:24:50,170
can't believe you're

670
00:24:50,200 --> 00:24:51,253
Drinking a $1,000 bottle of wine

671
00:24:51,283 --> 00:24:52,253
With a blow pop.

672
00:24:52,283 --> 00:24:54,712
All right, wait.

673
00:24:54,742 --> 00:24:56,379
Ow, i think i broke a tooth.

674
00:24:56,409 --> 00:24:58,088
Freak your mouth out.

675
00:24:58,118 --> 00:25:00,253
Okay.

676
00:25:00,283 --> 00:25:01,295
So instead of paying me,

677
00:25:01,325 --> 00:25:02,295
They give me this thousand

678
00:25:02,325 --> 00:25:03,420
Fucking dollar bottle of wine.

679
00:25:03,450 --> 00:25:04,754
It's ridiculous.

680
00:25:04,784 --> 00:25:05,754
don't think this is

681
00:25:05,784 --> 00:25:06,879
The rave.

682
00:25:06,909 --> 00:25:08,379
Maybe they're shooting a movie.

683
00:25:08,409 --> 00:25:09,379
Oh, my god, maybe we can

684
00:25:09,409 --> 00:25:10,879
Be in it.

685
00:25:10,909 --> 00:25:14,451
Hi.

686
00:25:30,200 --> 00:25:34,379
Sammi, sammi.

687
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:37,295
Holy shit.

688
00:25:37,325 --> 00:25:39,379
Come on. we have to go.

689
00:25:39,409 --> 00:25:40,712
Wait, what's that?

690
00:25:40,742 --> 00:25:41,796
Is that real money?

691
00:25:41,826 --> 00:25:42,837
Sammi, we need to go.

692
00:25:42,867 --> 00:25:44,004
There might be more of them.

693
00:25:44,034 --> 00:25:45,796
What if that's money?

694
00:25:45,826 --> 00:25:47,552
Sammi...

695
00:25:49,492 --> 00:25:50,712
Ew. come help me.

696
00:25:50,742 --> 00:25:51,962
Ew. oh, god. ew.

697
00:25:51,992 --> 00:25:55,576
This is so heavy.

698
00:25:59,450 --> 00:26:02,088
Jesus christ, sammi!

699
00:26:02,118 --> 00:26:04,385
Will you help me?

700
00:26:06,992 --> 00:26:09,253
Oh, eww!

701
00:26:09,283 --> 00:26:11,962
He's looking at me.

702
00:26:11,992 --> 00:26:14,879
It's money, it's money.

703
00:26:14,909 --> 00:26:18,075
Wait.

704
00:26:20,409 --> 00:26:22,712
It's fine, it's fine.

705
00:26:22,742 --> 00:26:24,004
You can't even see it.

706
00:26:24,034 --> 00:26:26,962
Okay, come on.

707
00:26:26,992 --> 00:26:29,879
Oh. oh, yeah!

708
00:26:29,909 --> 00:26:31,253
Okay, you stay here.

709
00:26:31,283 --> 00:26:32,712
I'm gonna get the car.

710
00:26:32,742 --> 00:26:33,837
Whoa. fuck you!

711
00:26:33,867 --> 00:26:35,212
Fuck you. i am not staying here.

712
00:26:35,242 --> 00:26:36,253
Someone has to stay with

713
00:26:36,283 --> 00:26:37,712
The money, sammi.

714
00:26:37,742 --> 00:26:38,879
Then you stay here and--

715
00:26:38,909 --> 00:26:40,212
Fuck that. the last time you

716
00:26:40,242 --> 00:26:41,295
Used my car, you backed into

717
00:26:41,325 --> 00:26:42,379
A pole.

718
00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:43,837
Okay, well, i'm not fucking

719
00:26:43,867 --> 00:26:46,712
Staying here by myself.

720
00:26:46,742 --> 00:26:49,046
Fine. go get the car.

721
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:50,170
Jesus! oh, dingbat, you need

722
00:26:50,200 --> 00:26:51,504
The fucking keys.

723
00:26:51,534 --> 00:26:53,253
Well, give me the--

724
00:26:53,283 --> 00:26:55,837
Oh, really? that's smart.

725
00:26:55,867 --> 00:26:57,129
Hurry. i'm going!

726
00:26:57,159 --> 00:26:59,004
You've never had to run with

727
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:01,837
Boots before.

728
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:03,837
Oh!

729
00:27:03,867 --> 00:27:07,587
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

730
00:27:07,617 --> 00:27:09,129
What?

731
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:10,962

732
00:27:10,992 --> 00:27:12,337
I hate you so much.

733
00:27:12,367 --> 00:27:13,379
Why?

734
00:27:13,409 --> 00:27:14,504
Because you always do

735
00:27:14,534 --> 00:27:18,545
This shit.

736
00:27:18,575 --> 00:27:20,962
Ow. ow, ow.

737
00:27:20,992 --> 00:27:23,337
Oh, my god.

738
00:27:23,367 --> 00:27:24,504
Just get the hell

739
00:27:24,534 --> 00:27:26,337
Out of my car.

740
00:27:26,367 --> 00:27:28,462
Okay.

741
00:27:28,492 --> 00:27:30,379
You don't have to be so pushy.

742
00:27:30,409 --> 00:27:31,587
Stop goofing around.

743
00:27:31,617 --> 00:27:35,451
Get your ass in the car. get in!

744
00:27:50,951 --> 00:27:55,212
Kris!

745
00:27:55,242 --> 00:27:56,545
Tara, do you have any idea

746
00:27:56,575 --> 00:27:58,004
What time it is?

747
00:27:58,034 --> 00:27:59,462
Babe, i need to tell you

748
00:27:59,492 --> 00:28:01,295
Something.

749
00:28:01,325 --> 00:28:02,587
What the fuck?

750
00:28:02,617 --> 00:28:05,712
Tara, what did you do?

751
00:28:05,742 --> 00:28:07,004
You shouldn't have taken

752
00:28:07,034 --> 00:28:08,879
That money.

753
00:28:08,909 --> 00:28:10,796
God, if i get mixed up in

754
00:28:10,826 --> 00:28:12,046
Anything, you know what's

755
00:28:12,076 --> 00:28:13,587
Gonna happen to me.

756
00:28:13,617 --> 00:28:15,962
Oh... look, sammi wanted

757
00:28:15,992 --> 00:28:17,212
To keep it between ourselves,

758
00:28:17,242 --> 00:28:22,212
But i wasn't about to.

759
00:28:22,242 --> 00:28:24,671
This money is for us.

760
00:28:24,701 --> 00:28:26,129
I mean, think about it.

761
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:27,587
We can move to, like, a little

762
00:28:27,617 --> 00:28:29,504
Beach somewhere, and open a tiny

763
00:28:29,534 --> 00:28:30,587
Restaurant.

764
00:28:30,617 --> 00:28:31,796
It would be so great.

765
00:28:31,826 --> 00:28:34,004
I'll totally cook, you'll...

766
00:28:34,034 --> 00:28:37,837
You'll run the place.

767
00:28:37,867 --> 00:28:40,671
Oh, god.

768
00:28:40,701 --> 00:28:43,046
To do the books for just one

769
00:28:43,076 --> 00:28:44,671
Little place.

770
00:28:44,701 --> 00:28:46,796
No old ladies with boxes of

771
00:28:46,826 --> 00:28:48,552
Receipts.

772
00:28:50,867 --> 00:28:57,367
Like a fairy tale.

773
00:28:57,701 --> 00:28:59,129
Fairy tales just don't

774
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:01,004
Happen.

775
00:29:01,034 --> 00:29:02,212
You're wrong, kris.

776
00:29:02,242 --> 00:29:03,796
They can.

777
00:29:03,826 --> 00:29:05,170
Whatever happens,

778
00:29:05,200 --> 00:29:07,754
You cannot lie to me.

779
00:29:07,784 --> 00:29:09,129
Okay? if we can't trust each

780
00:29:09,159 --> 00:29:10,921
Other...

781
00:29:10,951 --> 00:29:12,671
can trust you, and you can

782
00:29:12,701 --> 00:29:14,671
Trust me.

783
00:29:14,701 --> 00:29:16,796
I promise.

784
00:29:16,826 --> 00:29:19,879
Okay.

785
00:29:19,909 --> 00:29:21,462
Thank you, miss petrie.

786
00:29:21,492 --> 00:29:22,879
Is there anything else i can do

787
00:29:22,909 --> 00:29:24,379
For you today?

788
00:29:24,409 --> 00:29:27,046
Oh, sorry. um...

789
00:29:27,076 --> 00:29:30,545
This says my balance is $5.42.

790
00:29:30,575 --> 00:29:32,962
Is that before my deposit?

791
00:29:32,992 --> 00:29:34,170
No, ma'am, your account

792
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:37,212
Was overdrawn.

793
00:29:37,242 --> 00:29:41,909
Oh. okay.

794
00:29:43,534 --> 00:29:45,088
One more question.

795
00:29:45,118 --> 00:29:47,088
I have a canadian friend

796
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,754
In town from canada, and she

797
00:29:48,784 --> 00:29:50,754
Has some canadian money, and she

798
00:29:50,784 --> 00:29:52,253
Needs to exchange it.

799
00:29:52,283 --> 00:29:53,295
Can she do that here?

800
00:29:53,325 --> 00:29:54,337
Of course, ma'am. just send

801
00:29:54,367 --> 00:29:55,587
Her in, we'll take care of her

802
00:29:55,617 --> 00:29:56,587
For you.

803
00:29:56,617 --> 00:29:58,504
Oh! and is there a limit

804
00:29:58,534 --> 00:30:00,462
To how much she can exchange

805
00:30:00,492 --> 00:30:01,629
At a time?

806
00:30:01,659 --> 00:30:02,754
We have a $3,000-a-day limit

807
00:30:02,784 --> 00:30:04,754
At this branch.

808
00:30:04,784 --> 00:30:08,253
Wow. thank you.

809
00:30:08,283 --> 00:30:11,343
Thank you. thank you!

810
00:30:14,575 --> 00:30:18,004
Hey!

811
00:30:18,034 --> 00:30:20,129
Tara, jesus christ. what?

812
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,337
Come here. i need to tell you

813
00:30:21,367 --> 00:30:22,379
Something.

814
00:30:22,409 --> 00:30:24,420
Karl: leave us alone!

815
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,088
Hi. come here.

816
00:30:26,118 --> 00:30:28,379
Look, we have to go.

817
00:30:28,409 --> 00:30:30,337
We have to go do something,

818
00:30:30,367 --> 00:30:31,504
And we gotta do it now.

819
00:30:31,534 --> 00:30:32,921
Wait, no. i...

820
00:30:32,951 --> 00:30:34,004
No, you're really gonna

821
00:30:34,034 --> 00:30:35,212
Like it, trust me.

822
00:30:35,242 --> 00:30:37,921
See, the thing is, kris is

823
00:30:37,951 --> 00:30:39,253
Just too uptight for her own

824
00:30:39,283 --> 00:30:40,504
Good.

825
00:30:40,534 --> 00:30:41,754
Thank you, captain obvious.

826
00:30:41,784 --> 00:30:43,046
That still doesn't explain what

827
00:30:43,076 --> 00:30:44,295
The hell we're doing here.

828
00:30:44,325 --> 00:30:45,504
We're here because i'm tired

829
00:30:45,534 --> 00:30:46,712
Of working my ass off and

830
00:30:46,742 --> 00:30:48,088
Getting nothing in return.

831
00:30:48,118 --> 00:30:49,629
Life is meant to be lived.

832
00:30:49,659 --> 00:30:52,129
Right. so you're saying...

833
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:54,587
What are you saying?

834
00:30:54,617 --> 00:30:56,295
What i'm saying is

835
00:30:56,325 --> 00:30:58,004
That what kris doesn't know

836
00:30:58,034 --> 00:31:00,004
Won't hurt her.

837
00:31:00,034 --> 00:31:03,004
Nice. i like that.

838
00:31:03,034 --> 00:31:04,671
Okay. ha!

839
00:31:04,701 --> 00:31:05,879
Hey, where did you learn

840
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:07,337
How to do that?

841
00:31:07,367 --> 00:31:08,712
Boarding school.

842
00:31:08,742 --> 00:31:10,170
We used to steal liquor from

843
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:11,379
The teachers' lounge.

844
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:12,545
guess that's one thing you

845
00:31:12,575 --> 00:31:13,879
Can't learn in public school.

846
00:31:13,909 --> 00:31:15,253
Now we're only taking

847
00:31:15,283 --> 00:31:16,671
A little, and we can't buy

848
00:31:16,701 --> 00:31:17,754
Anything that anyone

849
00:31:17,784 --> 00:31:19,088
Will notice.

850
00:31:19,118 --> 00:31:20,867
Okay.

851
00:31:28,242 --> 00:31:29,671
Wow. uh...

852
00:31:29,701 --> 00:31:31,337
Hey, babe.

853
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:32,545
Tara, what did you do?

854
00:31:32,575 --> 00:31:34,337
Okay, don't get upset.

855
00:31:34,367 --> 00:31:35,629
I got a card in the mail from

856
00:31:35,659 --> 00:31:37,337
My dad, and inside was a check

857
00:31:37,367 --> 00:31:39,462
For three grand.

858
00:31:39,492 --> 00:31:41,504
Why? i thought he disowned

859
00:31:41,534 --> 00:31:42,754
You, like, five years ago

860
00:31:42,784 --> 00:31:43,837
When you came out.

861
00:31:43,867 --> 00:31:45,212
don't know. the card was

862
00:31:45,242 --> 00:31:48,170
Empty, so...

863
00:31:48,200 --> 00:31:50,170
Okay. you didn't think you

864
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,170
Could use this little windfall

865
00:31:52,200 --> 00:31:54,337
For, i don't fuckin' know,

866
00:31:54,367 --> 00:31:55,712
Um, rent?

867
00:31:55,742 --> 00:31:58,921
Rent? babe, come on.

868
00:31:58,951 --> 00:32:00,671
It's really good that we're

869
00:32:00,701 --> 00:32:02,337
Being careful and everything,

870
00:32:02,367 --> 00:32:03,671
But our lives are about to

871
00:32:03,701 --> 00:32:05,587
Change, and i think we should

872
00:32:05,617 --> 00:32:06,879
Celebrate.

873
00:32:06,909 --> 00:32:08,337
Don't you want to celebrate

874
00:32:08,367 --> 00:32:10,754
With me?

875
00:32:10,784 --> 00:32:14,867
Yeah. yeah.

876
00:32:21,534 --> 00:32:24,462
Love and happiness forever.

877
00:32:24,492 --> 00:32:27,825
Whoo!

878
00:33:07,409 --> 00:33:09,337
knew you could be fun.

879
00:33:09,367 --> 00:33:10,545
You party like a rock star

880
00:33:10,575 --> 00:33:12,170
When you leave your ass stick

881
00:33:12,200 --> 00:33:13,337
At home.

882
00:33:13,367 --> 00:33:14,545
told you she was fun.

883
00:33:14,575 --> 00:33:15,712
Trust me, sammi, if anyone

884
00:33:15,742 --> 00:33:17,587
Here has an ass stick, it's you.

885
00:33:17,617 --> 00:33:18,837
Yeah, i want one.

886
00:33:18,867 --> 00:33:20,170
I want one.

887
00:33:20,200 --> 00:33:21,379
Want one what, babe?

888
00:33:21,409 --> 00:33:23,504
Wow, speak of the devil.

889
00:33:23,534 --> 00:33:24,504
Man, that is good.

890
00:33:24,534 --> 00:33:25,671
What happened to your hand,

891
00:33:25,701 --> 00:33:26,837
Karl?

892
00:33:26,867 --> 00:33:28,337
Band-related injury.

893
00:33:28,367 --> 00:33:29,462
Set my guitar on fire.

894
00:33:29,492 --> 00:33:30,712
I'm that bad-ass.

895
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:33,046
Oh, baby, that musta hurt.

896
00:33:33,076 --> 00:33:34,253
could use a little bit

897
00:33:34,283 --> 00:33:35,462
Of medicine.

898
00:33:35,492 --> 00:33:36,545
What do you say, kris, huh?

899
00:33:36,575 --> 00:33:38,170
Little bit of medicine, huh?

900
00:33:38,200 --> 00:33:39,962
Me? yeah.

901
00:33:39,992 --> 00:33:41,088
Like that super motherfucking

902
00:33:41,118 --> 00:33:42,587
Shit stone brick of kind-ass

903
00:33:42,617 --> 00:33:43,587
Hash you sold kostas.

904
00:33:43,617 --> 00:33:44,921
What are you talking about,

905
00:33:44,951 --> 00:33:46,129
Karl?

906
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:47,462
Why do you always make up lies?

907
00:33:47,492 --> 00:33:48,629
ain't makin' this up.

908
00:33:48,659 --> 00:33:49,629
She didn't tell you about

909
00:33:49,659 --> 00:33:51,004
The thc?

910
00:33:51,034 --> 00:33:52,170
Kris, what are you...?

911
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:54,420
Come on, like 5k worth of

912
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,088
The purest lebanese blonde.

913
00:33:56,118 --> 00:33:57,170
This shit was good.

914
00:33:57,200 --> 00:33:58,253
I had to help her move it

915
00:33:58,283 --> 00:33:59,295
With my guy.

916
00:33:59,325 --> 00:34:00,629
She knows quality, but she don't

917
00:34:00,659 --> 00:34:01,712
Know shit about selling.

918
00:34:01,742 --> 00:34:03,462
Kris, what are you...?

919
00:34:03,492 --> 00:34:04,587
That's just... i think we've

920
00:34:04,617 --> 00:34:05,587
Had about enough fun for one

921
00:34:05,617 --> 00:34:06,962
Night.

922
00:34:06,992 --> 00:34:09,088
You goin' to get it?

923
00:34:09,118 --> 00:34:10,337
Are they goin' to get it?

924
00:34:10,367 --> 00:34:12,462
Baby, i think i know a way

925
00:34:12,492 --> 00:34:15,212
That i can make you feel better.

926
00:34:15,242 --> 00:34:17,088
Oh, yeah!

927
00:34:17,118 --> 00:34:18,212
Sounds like he brought his

928
00:34:18,242 --> 00:34:19,253
Ass stick.

929
00:34:19,283 --> 00:34:20,420
Fucking karl should not

930
00:34:20,450 --> 00:34:21,587
Be here.

931
00:34:21,617 --> 00:34:23,253
Oh, what's wrong?

932
00:34:23,283 --> 00:34:24,545
You're afraid i'll find out

933
00:34:24,575 --> 00:34:25,921
More of your drug deals?

934
00:34:25,951 --> 00:34:27,004
Tara, come on. i told you

935
00:34:27,034 --> 00:34:28,379
It wasn't like that.

936
00:34:28,409 --> 00:34:29,629
No, no, i know.

937
00:34:29,659 --> 00:34:31,212
It was just some stoner tax

938
00:34:31,242 --> 00:34:32,253
Client who left you with

939
00:34:32,283 --> 00:34:33,587
No choice. i get it.

940
00:34:33,617 --> 00:34:35,295
I just didn't think we had

941
00:34:35,325 --> 00:34:36,921
Any secrets.

942
00:34:36,951 --> 00:34:38,921
It wasn't a secret, tara.

943
00:34:38,951 --> 00:34:40,587
I didn't... i didn't think

944
00:34:40,617 --> 00:34:42,587
It would concern you.

945
00:34:42,617 --> 00:34:44,170
But sammi... sammi can't keep

946
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:45,545
A fucking secret.

947
00:34:45,575 --> 00:34:47,046
Sammi's not gonna spill

948
00:34:47,076 --> 00:34:48,379
The beans.

949
00:34:48,409 --> 00:34:49,379
Yeah, are we talking about

950
00:34:49,409 --> 00:34:51,253
The same sammi?

951
00:34:51,283 --> 00:34:52,420
What is wrong with you?

952
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:57,921
What are you so upset about?

953
00:34:57,951 --> 00:34:59,451
Maybe...

954
00:35:01,951 --> 00:35:03,379
Maybe because you stole money

955
00:35:03,409 --> 00:35:05,046
Out of the case, and you didn't

956
00:35:05,076 --> 00:35:07,629
Tell me about it.

957
00:35:07,659 --> 00:35:09,004
You knew and didn't

958
00:35:09,034 --> 00:35:12,462
Say anything?

959
00:35:12,492 --> 00:35:15,088
Yeah, i just...

960
00:35:15,118 --> 00:35:17,088
I thought maybe you were

961
00:35:17,118 --> 00:35:18,545
Right about me, and i needed

962
00:35:18,575 --> 00:35:21,379
To loosen up a bit.

963
00:35:21,409 --> 00:35:23,004
You heard me say that?

964
00:35:23,034 --> 00:35:24,950
No, i just know that...

965
00:35:29,242 --> 00:35:30,796
You said that about me?

966
00:35:30,826 --> 00:35:33,545
didn't...

967
00:35:33,575 --> 00:35:35,253
Wow. you know what, tara?

968
00:35:35,283 --> 00:35:36,504
I know you think i'm too

969
00:35:36,534 --> 00:35:39,129
Uptight, but i get an extra

970
00:35:39,159 --> 00:35:41,046
15 years if i get caught.

971
00:35:41,076 --> 00:35:45,004
know.

972
00:35:45,034 --> 00:35:46,879
Kris.

973
00:35:46,909 --> 00:35:48,962
Damn it, kris. please.

974
00:35:48,992 --> 00:35:53,326
Kris, i'm sorry.

975
00:36:30,118 --> 00:36:31,462
Tara? what?

976
00:36:31,492 --> 00:36:35,796
It's me.

977
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:37,962
What are you doing outside?

978
00:36:37,992 --> 00:36:39,796
Oh, i walked karl to the

979
00:36:39,826 --> 00:36:41,129
Car, and then got a paper,

980
00:36:41,159 --> 00:36:47,659
But i forgot my key.

981
00:36:48,492 --> 00:36:51,462
So, what?

982
00:36:51,492 --> 00:36:53,921
Is there anything you wanna

983
00:36:53,951 --> 00:36:55,962
Tell me?

984
00:36:55,992 --> 00:36:57,295
Oh.

985
00:36:57,325 --> 00:36:58,962
Kris is so upset at me.

986
00:36:58,992 --> 00:37:00,420
I can't talk about it right now.

987
00:37:00,450 --> 00:37:01,962
She's still in the shower.

988
00:37:01,992 --> 00:37:04,088
Uh, nope. that's not

989
00:37:04,118 --> 00:37:05,962
What i was talking about.

990
00:37:05,992 --> 00:37:07,337
You sure there isn't maybe

991
00:37:07,367 --> 00:37:09,088
Something else you wanted

992
00:37:09,118 --> 00:37:11,295
To say?

993
00:37:11,325 --> 00:37:12,545
Oh, my god. what?

994
00:37:12,575 --> 00:37:14,004
They found the warehouse.

995
00:37:14,034 --> 00:37:15,337
Tara, they found the fucking

996
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:16,462
Warehouse.

997
00:37:16,492 --> 00:37:17,962
What? come here, look.

998
00:37:17,992 --> 00:37:19,462
Oh, my god.

999
00:37:19,492 --> 00:37:21,921
Oh, no.

1000
00:37:21,951 --> 00:37:23,253
They didn't find anything.

1001
00:37:23,283 --> 00:37:25,212
Look, they didn't find anything.

1002
00:37:25,242 --> 00:37:27,051
Everything's gonna be okay.

1003
00:37:27,617 --> 00:37:29,088
Jesus. that's really

1004
00:37:29,118 --> 00:37:30,587
Aggressive.

1005
00:37:30,617 --> 00:37:34,253
What the hell?

1006
00:37:34,283 --> 00:37:38,337
Come here, bitch!

1007
00:37:38,367 --> 00:37:41,295
Where's the other dyke?

1008
00:37:41,325 --> 00:37:43,088
She left for work.

1009
00:37:43,118 --> 00:37:44,587
Lie to me again, bitch,

1010
00:37:44,617 --> 00:37:45,962
And i'll blow your fucking

1011
00:37:45,992 --> 00:37:47,088
Head off! now where's the other

1012
00:37:47,118 --> 00:37:48,379
Fucking dyke?

1013
00:37:48,409 --> 00:37:52,451
Hey, asshole, i'm right here.

1014
00:37:55,283 --> 00:37:57,170
What the fuck?

1015
00:37:57,200 --> 00:37:59,671
Drop it.

1016
00:37:59,701 --> 00:38:04,576
Drop it or i'll cut her throat.

1017
00:38:24,617 --> 00:38:26,212
Sammi, go get a mop and clean

1018
00:38:26,242 --> 00:38:30,742
Up the blood so no one sees.

1019
00:38:57,450 --> 00:38:58,504
What's up?

1020
00:38:58,534 --> 00:38:59,587
Why are your titties ignoring

1021
00:38:59,617 --> 00:39:03,742
Me?

1022
00:39:09,575 --> 00:39:11,921
Can i trust you, karl?

1023
00:39:11,951 --> 00:39:13,754
Course you can, babe.

1024
00:39:13,784 --> 00:39:14,796
You're my billy joe

1025
00:39:14,826 --> 00:39:16,295
To my bobbi sue.

1026
00:39:16,325 --> 00:39:17,545
don't know what you just

1027
00:39:17,575 --> 00:39:21,671
Said, but i, like, really...

1028
00:39:21,701 --> 00:39:23,837
Like, really need to be able

1029
00:39:23,867 --> 00:39:25,545
To trust you.

1030
00:39:25,575 --> 00:39:26,629
just said you could.

1031
00:39:26,659 --> 00:39:27,962
What's up, buttercup?

1032
00:39:27,992 --> 00:39:32,462
Tara and i, we kinda sorta...

1033
00:39:32,492 --> 00:39:36,796
Found...

1034
00:39:36,826 --> 00:39:41,253
One million dollars!!

1035
00:39:41,283 --> 00:39:43,504
What do ya mean, sorta found?

1036
00:39:43,534 --> 00:39:44,629
Well, it was, like, a drug

1037
00:39:44,659 --> 00:39:46,253
Deal gone bad, or something.

1038
00:39:46,283 --> 00:39:47,504
It's not important.

1039
00:39:47,534 --> 00:39:48,754
The point is, is we found

1040
00:39:48,784 --> 00:39:50,004
A bunch of dead guys, and then

1041
00:39:50,034 --> 00:39:52,504
We took... borrowed, stole...

1042
00:39:52,534 --> 00:39:54,004
Whatever, this huge bag of

1043
00:39:54,034 --> 00:39:55,337
Money.

1044
00:39:55,367 --> 00:39:56,420
All right, then. let's pack

1045
00:39:56,450 --> 00:39:57,420
Up and go to mexico like

1046
00:39:57,450 --> 00:39:58,545
Tonight.

1047
00:39:58,575 --> 00:40:00,253
That's what i said.

1048
00:40:00,283 --> 00:40:02,004
But kris was being all fucking

1049
00:40:02,034 --> 00:40:04,337
Controlling like she always is,

1050
00:40:04,367 --> 00:40:05,379
And she said that we can't

1051
00:40:05,409 --> 00:40:06,754
Just bring that much money

1052
00:40:06,784 --> 00:40:07,962
Across the border, 'cause if we

1053
00:40:07,992 --> 00:40:09,587
Get caught, they'll arrest us

1054
00:40:09,617 --> 00:40:10,629
And put us in some mexican--

1055
00:40:10,659 --> 00:40:11,962
No, no, no.

1056
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,629
They only check on the way out.

1057
00:40:13,659 --> 00:40:15,088
On the way in, you can probably

1058
00:40:15,118 --> 00:40:16,462
Have a nuclear bomb in

1059
00:40:16,492 --> 00:40:17,587
A handbag, they won't even

1060
00:40:17,617 --> 00:40:18,671
Notice.

1061
00:40:18,701 --> 00:40:19,754
know. i said that, too.

1062
00:40:19,784 --> 00:40:22,088
I an so smart.

1063
00:40:22,118 --> 00:40:23,671
But kris is making us wait to

1064
00:40:23,701 --> 00:40:25,046
See if anyone's gonna come

1065
00:40:25,076 --> 00:40:26,504
Looking for it.

1066
00:40:26,534 --> 00:40:27,545
What do you mean, she's

1067
00:40:27,575 --> 00:40:28,712
Making you? she's not the boss

1068
00:40:28,742 --> 00:40:29,837
Of you, is she?

1069
00:40:29,867 --> 00:40:32,962
No. no one's the boss of me.

1070
00:40:32,992 --> 00:40:34,754
But she said it's really hard

1071
00:40:34,784 --> 00:40:36,754
To exchange canadian money

1072
00:40:36,784 --> 00:40:38,088
Into real money or something

1073
00:40:38,118 --> 00:40:39,587
Like that.

1074
00:40:39,617 --> 00:40:42,587
Canadian money, huh?

1075
00:40:42,617 --> 00:40:44,170
Yeah, i don't know about all

1076
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:45,420
That.

1077
00:40:45,450 --> 00:40:46,462
I'm pretty sure they just use

1078
00:40:46,492 --> 00:40:48,587
Regular money in canada.

1079
00:40:48,617 --> 00:40:51,587
Uh, no. it's canadian.

1080
00:40:51,617 --> 00:40:53,671
It has a picture of canada

1081
00:40:53,701 --> 00:40:55,754
On it, and it says "canada."

1082
00:40:55,784 --> 00:40:57,420
It's canadian.

1083
00:40:57,450 --> 00:40:58,545
Why were the drug dealers

1084
00:40:58,575 --> 00:41:00,379
Using canadian money in america?

1085
00:41:00,409 --> 00:41:01,921
don't fucking know, karl.

1086
00:41:01,951 --> 00:41:04,427
I didn't ask the dead guys.

1087
00:41:05,617 --> 00:41:06,587
Tara: hey.

1088
00:41:06,617 --> 00:41:08,129
Tara! come here.

1089
00:41:08,159 --> 00:41:09,337
I need to tell you something.

1090
00:41:09,367 --> 00:41:11,046
Ugh!

1091
00:41:11,076 --> 00:41:14,075
Leave us alone.

1092
00:41:15,367 --> 00:41:19,754
Hi. um, oh, my god.

1093
00:41:19,784 --> 00:41:21,129
Look, we have to go.

1094
00:41:21,159 --> 00:41:22,587
We have to go do something,

1095
00:41:22,617 --> 00:41:24,302
And we gotta do it now.

1096
00:41:26,450 --> 00:41:27,420
Hi. i brought my friend.

1097
00:41:27,450 --> 00:41:29,170
She's canadian.

1098
00:41:29,200 --> 00:41:30,170
Excuse me, but you can't

1099
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:31,968
Drink that in here.

1100
00:41:32,617 --> 00:41:36,075
Oh, sorry, eh.

1101
00:41:36,575 --> 00:41:38,492
Canadians.

1102
00:41:49,575 --> 00:41:50,754
hey, baby.

1103
00:41:50,784 --> 00:41:52,921
Karl, it's me.

1104
00:41:52,951 --> 00:41:54,879
Can you come to privilege?

1105
00:41:54,909 --> 00:41:56,962
I'm bored and lonely.

1106
00:41:56,992 --> 00:41:58,587
There's free booze.

1107
00:41:58,617 --> 00:41:59,587
' 'm there, mama.

1108
00:41:59,617 --> 00:42:00,712
What happened to your hand?

1109
00:42:00,742 --> 00:42:02,088
Band-related injury.

1110
00:42:02,118 --> 00:42:03,587
Set my guitar on fire.

1111
00:42:03,617 --> 00:42:04,962
I'm that bad-ass.

1112
00:42:04,992 --> 00:42:07,088
Oh! oh, yeah.

1113
00:42:07,118 --> 00:42:08,587
Give it to me.

1114
00:42:08,617 --> 00:42:10,462
Give it to me harder.

1115
00:42:10,492 --> 00:42:13,552
Oh, i want more. oh, yeah!

00:42:55,826 --> 00:42:57,879
We gonna have real sex now?

1139
00:42:57,909 --> 00:42:59,046
No. even better.

1140
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,337
We're goin' to the hardware

1141
00:43:00,367 --> 00:43:01,420
Store.

1142
00:43:01,450 --> 00:43:02,712
Get up!

1143
00:43:02,742 --> 00:43:04,700
Sounds kinky.

1144
00:43:08,450 --> 00:43:09,587
Why couldn't we just actually

1145
00:43:09,617 --> 00:43:10,587
Had real sex until they fell

1146
00:43:10,617 --> 00:43:12,004
Asleep?

1147
00:43:12,034 --> 00:43:13,587
Because you always pass out

1148
00:43:13,617 --> 00:43:16,534
After sex, karl.

1149
00:43:18,742 --> 00:43:21,921
Okay, so just cut the lock.

1150
00:43:21,951 --> 00:43:24,992
Let's see who's dumb now.

1151
00:43:45,118 --> 00:43:46,962
What's wrong, karl?

1152
00:43:46,992 --> 00:43:48,170
Just cut it.

1153
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:49,212
That's what i'm fucking

1154
00:43:49,242 --> 00:43:50,212
Trying to do.

1155
00:43:50,242 --> 00:43:51,545
Well, try fucking harder,

1156
00:43:51,575 --> 00:43:53,170
Or do i need to go find someone

1157
00:43:53,200 --> 00:43:54,420
Who's younger and stronger

1158
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:58,409
And hotter to do this?

1159
00:44:07,118 --> 00:44:08,379
That's a lot harder than it

1160
00:44:08,409 --> 00:44:09,879
Looks on tv.

1161
00:44:09,909 --> 00:44:10,879
Yeah, well, toughen up,

1162
00:44:10,909 --> 00:44:11,962
Buttercup, 'cause you still got

1163
00:44:11,992 --> 00:44:13,253
Two more locks to cut.

1164
00:44:13,283 --> 00:44:15,004
Two? what you talkin' about?

1165
00:44:15,034 --> 00:44:16,295
You got a key to one.

1166
00:44:16,325 --> 00:44:18,129
Yeah, but if their locks are

1167
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:19,295
The only ones that are cut,

1168
00:44:19,325 --> 00:44:20,420
They'll know it was me who took

1169
00:44:20,450 --> 00:44:22,129
The money, won't they, duh?

1170
00:44:22,159 --> 00:44:23,337
Who gives a shit?

1171
00:44:23,367 --> 00:44:25,088
We'll be in mexico by then.

1172
00:44:25,118 --> 00:44:26,212
Oh, my god. okay, just give

1173
00:44:26,242 --> 00:44:27,379
Me the freakin' thing--

1174
00:44:27,409 --> 00:44:28,629
Stay the fuck back, okay?

1175
00:44:28,659 --> 00:44:29,962
I got this.

1176
00:44:29,992 --> 00:44:32,545
What are you doin'?

1177
00:44:32,575 --> 00:44:34,379
Why are you laughing?

1178
00:44:34,409 --> 00:44:35,629
What are you doing?

1179
00:44:35,659 --> 00:44:37,545
' M gettin' down and dirty.

1180
00:44:37,575 --> 00:44:39,379
Isn't that the way you like it?

1181
00:44:39,409 --> 00:44:42,968
Um... okay. just get it open.

1182
00:44:43,909 --> 00:44:47,618
Motherfucker, come on!

1183
00:44:50,575 --> 00:44:53,420
Whoo!uno mas.

1184
00:44:53,450 --> 00:44:56,212
Whoo! out of the way, babe.

1185
00:44:56,242 --> 00:44:57,379
Get out of my way.

1186
00:44:57,409 --> 00:44:58,629
Here we go.

1187
00:44:58,659 --> 00:45:00,420
You can do it, baby.

1188
00:45:00,450 --> 00:45:02,420
You're so strong.

1189
00:45:02,450 --> 00:45:06,420
I can see it.

1190
00:45:06,450 --> 00:45:09,379
Ha! yeah, motherfucker!

1191
00:45:09,409 --> 00:45:11,420
( squeals ) see, aren't you

1192
00:45:11,450 --> 00:45:13,295
Happy we didn't have sex now?

1193
00:45:13,325 --> 00:45:14,420
You needed to save your

1194
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:15,545
Strength.

1195
00:45:15,575 --> 00:45:16,587
Good call, baby.

1196
00:45:16,617 --> 00:45:18,212
Ooh, you're so sweaty.

1197
00:45:18,242 --> 00:45:19,337
Okay, open it up, open it up,

1198
00:45:19,367 --> 00:45:20,629
Open it up, open, open.

1199
00:45:20,659 --> 00:45:22,451
Open, open, open.

1200
00:45:27,159 --> 00:45:29,129
don't get it.

1201
00:45:29,159 --> 00:45:32,046
Where's the money?

1202
00:45:32,076 --> 00:45:34,046
Hey, where's the fucking money?

1203
00:45:34,076 --> 00:45:36,504
don't fucking know, karl!

1204
00:45:36,534 --> 00:45:39,337
Oh, goddamn it!

1205
00:45:39,367 --> 00:45:42,545
Apparently, the fucking, lying,

1206
00:45:42,575 --> 00:45:44,545
Cheating bitch-face tara

1207
00:45:44,575 --> 00:45:46,212
Came back and took it.

1208
00:45:46,242 --> 00:45:47,545
God, that smart-aleck,

1209
00:45:47,575 --> 00:45:50,051
Two-timing traitor.

1210
00:45:52,242 --> 00:45:55,212
Oh, oh, she stole the money

1211
00:45:55,242 --> 00:45:57,462
Before you could steal it first.

1212
00:45:57,492 --> 00:45:59,295
Oh, my god, that's good.

1213
00:45:59,325 --> 00:46:00,462
It is not fucking funny,

1214
00:46:00,492 --> 00:46:02,337
Karl. stop laughing!

1215
00:46:02,367 --> 00:46:04,212
No shit, sparkles.

1216
00:46:04,242 --> 00:46:05,337
You're not the one who just

1217
00:46:05,367 --> 00:46:06,337
Dropped a nut trying to open

1218
00:46:06,367 --> 00:46:07,712
An empty locker.

1219
00:46:07,742 --> 00:46:08,837
cannot fucking believe

1220
00:46:08,867 --> 00:46:10,712
She would do this to me.

1221
00:46:10,742 --> 00:46:12,462
Goddamn it!

1222
00:46:12,492 --> 00:46:13,545
How do you know it was her

1223
00:46:13,575 --> 00:46:14,962
And not the other one?

1224
00:46:14,992 --> 00:46:16,295
Uh, i saw her pick one lock.

1225
00:46:16,325 --> 00:46:17,962
She could easily pick two locks,

1226
00:46:17,992 --> 00:46:19,545
Now, couldn't she?

1227
00:46:19,575 --> 00:46:21,046
Take me home. i'm gonna go kill

1228
00:46:21,076 --> 00:46:24,129
That fucking bitch.

1229
00:46:24,159 --> 00:46:27,337
Wait up, darlin'.

1230
00:46:27,367 --> 00:46:31,409
I got a better idea.

1231
00:46:42,492 --> 00:46:44,170
Just relax now.

1232
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:45,170
Do like we talked about, and

1233
00:46:45,200 --> 00:46:46,379
Everything's gonna be fine.

1234
00:46:46,409 --> 00:46:47,587
''ve never done anything

1235
00:46:47,617 --> 00:46:49,129
Like this before.

1236
00:46:49,159 --> 00:46:50,295
You still ain't gonna do

1237
00:46:50,325 --> 00:46:51,462
Nothin' like this; i am.

1238
00:46:51,492 --> 00:46:52,587
All's you gotta do is be your

1239
00:46:52,617 --> 00:46:54,170
Usual sunny little self.

1240
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:55,379
Soon as we know where the money

1241
00:46:55,409 --> 00:46:56,379
Is, we'll go get it, get the

1242
00:46:56,409 --> 00:46:57,629
Fuck outta dodge, okay?

1243
00:46:57,659 --> 00:46:58,962
Yeah, 'cause i'm so sunny

1244
00:46:58,992 --> 00:47:00,420
Right now.

1245
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:01,420
Listen, we don't have to do

1246
00:47:01,450 --> 00:47:03,004
This if you don't want to.

1247
00:47:03,034 --> 00:47:04,170
But if it was me, i'd be

1248
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:05,462
Pretty fuckin' pissed.

1249
00:47:05,492 --> 00:47:07,004
They wouldn't even have this

1250
00:47:07,034 --> 00:47:08,337
Money if it wasn't for you.

1251
00:47:08,367 --> 00:47:10,088
Yeah. you're right.

1252
00:47:10,118 --> 00:47:12,004
I'm just taking back what's mine

1253
00:47:12,034 --> 00:47:13,129
In the first place.

1254
00:47:13,159 --> 00:47:14,337
They think they're so much,

1255
00:47:14,367 --> 00:47:15,545
Like, smarter than me.

1256
00:47:15,575 --> 00:47:16,962
Exactly. you're just rightin'

1257
00:47:16,992 --> 00:47:18,420
A wrong that was done to you

1258
00:47:18,450 --> 00:47:19,420
Before you could do a wrong

1259
00:47:19,450 --> 00:47:20,921
To them first.

1260
00:47:20,951 --> 00:47:22,712
Huh?

1261
00:47:22,742 --> 00:47:24,129
Doesn't matter.

1262
00:47:24,159 --> 00:47:27,129
Just take a moment, clear

1263
00:47:27,159 --> 00:47:30,379
Your chakras, get in the zone.

1264
00:47:30,409 --> 00:47:32,129
Mm-hmm.

1265
00:47:32,159 --> 00:47:33,962
Yeah? i like that.

1266
00:47:33,992 --> 00:47:35,420
You there? uh-huh.

1267
00:47:35,450 --> 00:47:37,046
All right. you ready?

1268
00:47:37,076 --> 00:47:38,337
Yeah.

1269
00:47:38,367 --> 00:47:42,783
You go, girl.

1270
00:48:01,283 --> 00:48:03,921
Tara.

1271
00:48:03,951 --> 00:48:05,212
What?

1272
00:48:05,242 --> 00:48:09,129
It's me.

1273
00:48:09,159 --> 00:48:12,046
What are you doing outside?

1274
00:48:12,076 --> 00:48:14,088
Oh, i walked karl to the car

1275
00:48:14,118 --> 00:48:15,837
And then got a paper, but

1276
00:48:15,867 --> 00:48:17,742
I forgot my key.

1277
00:48:21,076 --> 00:48:24,825
Right here.

1278
00:48:28,909 --> 00:48:30,170
How does she know

1279
00:48:30,200 --> 00:48:31,545
How to do that?

1280
00:48:31,575 --> 00:48:33,046
Doesn't matter. just be

1281
00:48:33,076 --> 00:48:34,046
Grateful that she did,

1282
00:48:34,076 --> 00:48:36,046
Otherwise, we'd both be dead.

1283
00:48:36,076 --> 00:48:38,088
No. no, no, no, no, no.

1284
00:48:38,118 --> 00:48:40,129
That's not good enough,

1285
00:48:40,159 --> 00:48:41,295
Okay, tara?

1286
00:48:41,325 --> 00:48:42,545
People don't just know how to

1287
00:48:42,575 --> 00:48:44,879
Fucking execute people.

1288
00:48:44,909 --> 00:48:46,046
Sammi...

1289
00:48:46,076 --> 00:48:47,379
Do you know what that means?

1290
00:48:47,409 --> 00:48:48,921
That means that we're

1291
00:48:48,951 --> 00:48:50,212
Witnesses.

1292
00:48:50,242 --> 00:48:51,212
People don't just let witnesses

1293
00:48:51,242 --> 00:48:53,088
Lay around so that they can

1294
00:48:53,118 --> 00:48:55,004
Snatch on them.

1295
00:48:55,034 --> 00:48:56,545
Snitch.

1296
00:48:56,575 --> 00:48:58,046
There's a reason she knows how

1297
00:48:58,076 --> 00:48:59,253
To use a gun.

1298
00:48:59,283 --> 00:49:01,545
Yeah, yeah, like maybe she's

1299
00:49:01,575 --> 00:49:04,170
An enforcer for the mob.

1300
00:49:04,200 --> 00:49:05,921
For the mob!

1301
00:49:05,951 --> 00:49:07,921
That's probably where she went.

1302
00:49:07,951 --> 00:49:09,462
Oh, my god.

1303
00:49:09,492 --> 00:49:10,962
Oh, my god, yeah.

1304
00:49:10,992 --> 00:49:12,088
She probably went back to the

1305
00:49:12,118 --> 00:49:13,545
Mob, and she's going to get

1306
00:49:13,575 --> 00:49:15,545
More bullets, and now she's

1307
00:49:15,575 --> 00:49:18,427
Gonna fucking kill us, too.

1308
00:49:19,242 --> 00:49:20,962
Relax, okay?

1309
00:49:20,992 --> 00:49:22,088
You're right. it wasn't the

1310
00:49:22,118 --> 00:49:25,088
First time she's killed someone.

1311
00:49:25,118 --> 00:49:27,545
Oh, my god.

1312
00:49:27,575 --> 00:49:29,170
I fucking knew it.

1313
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:30,545
I fucking knew it.

1314
00:49:30,575 --> 00:49:32,545
All right.

1315
00:49:32,575 --> 00:49:34,796
I probably shouldn't tell you

1316
00:49:34,826 --> 00:49:38,046
This, but when kris was five,

1317
00:49:38,076 --> 00:49:39,337
Her mother married this guy,

1318
00:49:39,367 --> 00:49:41,212
And she was raised in this

1319
00:49:41,242 --> 00:49:42,253
Survivalist camp.

1320
00:49:42,283 --> 00:49:43,420
What the fuck is

1321
00:49:43,450 --> 00:49:45,046
A survivalist camp?

1322
00:49:45,076 --> 00:49:46,253
You know, like, white power,

1323
00:49:46,283 --> 00:49:48,088
Guys in the hills, hoarding

1324
00:49:48,118 --> 00:49:49,921
Guns.

1325
00:49:49,951 --> 00:49:51,253
She grew up with these

1326
00:49:51,283 --> 00:49:53,088
Religious nuts in this

1327
00:49:53,118 --> 00:49:54,587
Community.

1328
00:49:54,617 --> 00:49:56,629
Oh, my god. oh, fuck, fuck.

1329
00:49:56,659 --> 00:49:59,088
Well, the brainwashing didn't

1330
00:49:59,118 --> 00:50:01,337
Stick, and, you know, plus being

1331
00:50:01,367 --> 00:50:02,545
Into girls and all, they didn't

1332
00:50:02,575 --> 00:50:03,545
Have a lot of tolerance

1333
00:50:03,575 --> 00:50:05,129
For that.

1334
00:50:05,159 --> 00:50:08,253
Anyways, she escaped, but

1335
00:50:08,283 --> 00:50:11,462
She killed three of them.

1336
00:50:11,492 --> 00:50:14,295
The judge said it was

1337
00:50:14,325 --> 00:50:16,088
Extenuating circumstances,

1338
00:50:16,118 --> 00:50:17,545
So she didn't have to do

1339
00:50:17,575 --> 00:50:18,796
That much time.

1340
00:50:18,826 --> 00:50:20,504
Kris is a trained fucking

1341
00:50:20,534 --> 00:50:22,170
Killer.

1342
00:50:22,200 --> 00:50:23,295
That makes a lot of sense,

1343
00:50:23,325 --> 00:50:24,837
Actually.

1344
00:50:24,867 --> 00:50:26,545
am only telling you this

1345
00:50:26,575 --> 00:50:29,295
Because...

1346
00:50:29,325 --> 00:50:31,671
Look, it is her deepest,

1347
00:50:31,701 --> 00:50:33,629
Darkest secret, and if she

1348
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:35,796
Ever finds out that i told you,

1349
00:50:35,826 --> 00:50:38,796
She will be so upset with me.

1350
00:50:38,826 --> 00:50:40,295
Of course i'm not gonna say

1351
00:50:40,325 --> 00:50:43,379
Anything to her about this.

1352
00:50:43,409 --> 00:50:47,671
Okay.

1353
00:50:47,701 --> 00:50:50,545
Aren't you afraid?

1354
00:50:50,575 --> 00:50:52,379
Of what?

1355
00:50:52,409 --> 00:50:55,837
Of her.

1356
00:50:55,867 --> 00:50:58,295
Kris and i love each other.

1357
00:50:58,325 --> 00:51:03,159
Why would i be afraid of her?

1358
00:51:07,659 --> 00:51:09,337
Then why did you fucking go

1359
00:51:09,367 --> 00:51:10,337
Back and take the money?

1360
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:11,629
What the hell are you

1361
00:51:11,659 --> 00:51:12,837
Talking about?

1362
00:51:12,867 --> 00:51:14,629
Oh, please. i'm not dumb,

1363
00:51:14,659 --> 00:51:16,587
So don't treat me like i am.

1364
00:51:16,617 --> 00:51:18,129
I went back last night to take

1365
00:51:18,159 --> 00:51:19,629
The bag, but you had already

1366
00:51:19,659 --> 00:51:21,253
Gotten there.

1367
00:51:21,283 --> 00:51:22,671
You went back to take the

1368
00:51:22,701 --> 00:51:25,295
Money, and it was gone?

1369
00:51:25,325 --> 00:51:27,837
Oh, my god. really?

1370
00:51:27,867 --> 00:51:29,587
I know that you took the money.

1371
00:51:29,617 --> 00:51:30,671
Just admit it.

1372
00:51:30,701 --> 00:51:32,253
She didn't take the money,

1373
00:51:32,283 --> 00:51:33,587
Sammi. i did.

1374
00:51:33,617 --> 00:51:35,170
What?

1375
00:51:35,200 --> 00:51:36,420
Kris, what are you saying?

1376
00:51:36,450 --> 00:51:37,420
' M saying, i knew she

1377
00:51:37,450 --> 00:51:39,004
Couldn't be trusted.

1378
00:51:39,034 --> 00:51:40,170
By the way, you've been lying to

1379
00:51:40,200 --> 00:51:41,170
Me; i knew you couldn't be

1380
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:42,545
Trusted either.

1381
00:51:42,575 --> 00:51:44,420
You fucking bitch!

1382
00:51:44,450 --> 00:51:46,004
Sammi, your job is clothes.

1383
00:51:46,034 --> 00:51:47,337
I need you to pack us one bag

1384
00:51:47,367 --> 00:51:48,420
Of essentials each.

1385
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:49,545
Since your friends at the

1386
00:51:49,575 --> 00:51:51,046
Warehouse clearly know where

1387
00:51:51,076 --> 00:51:52,170
We live, we're not gonna be

1388
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,295
Coming back here.

1389
00:51:53,325 --> 00:51:54,504
Don't pack too much that they

1390
00:51:54,534 --> 00:51:55,712
Would know that we left.

1391
00:51:55,742 --> 00:51:56,754
We don't want them to think--

1392
00:51:56,784 --> 00:51:58,212
No, you are going to tell me

1393
00:51:58,242 --> 00:51:59,754
Where the fucking bag is--

1394
00:51:59,784 --> 00:52:01,129
You do not wanna fuck with me

1395
00:52:01,159 --> 00:52:04,796
Right now.

1396
00:52:04,826 --> 00:52:07,212
How did you open the locks?

1397
00:52:07,242 --> 00:52:08,212
made copies of your keys

1398
00:52:08,242 --> 00:52:10,295
Before i gave you your locks.

1399
00:52:10,325 --> 00:52:12,879
Here, help me with this.

1400
00:52:12,909 --> 00:52:14,170
So you didn't trust me

1401
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:15,712
To begin with.

1402
00:52:15,742 --> 00:52:17,420
Yeah, and you proved me

1403
00:52:17,450 --> 00:52:20,754
Right.

1404
00:52:20,784 --> 00:52:22,004
Time to put your abattoir skills

1405
00:52:22,034 --> 00:52:23,253
To work.

1406
00:52:23,283 --> 00:52:26,253
Grab your knives, follow me.

1407
00:52:26,283 --> 00:52:31,451
( quietly ) fuck.

1408
00:52:51,242 --> 00:52:52,712
All right, tara, start with

1409
00:52:52,742 --> 00:52:54,088
The bigger joints, and then

1410
00:52:54,118 --> 00:52:55,129
Work down.

1411
00:52:55,159 --> 00:52:56,129
got this, kris.

1412
00:52:56,159 --> 00:52:57,212
Do something about the back

1413
00:52:57,242 --> 00:52:59,754
Splatter.

1414
00:52:59,784 --> 00:53:01,295
Get in here.

1415
00:53:01,325 --> 00:53:02,420
I can keep the body still while

1416
00:53:02,450 --> 00:53:03,712
Tara cuts, but i need you to

1417
00:53:03,742 --> 00:53:04,754
Help soak up the blood that's

1418
00:53:04,784 --> 00:53:08,796
Getting on the floor.

1419
00:53:08,826 --> 00:53:12,576
Oh, god.

1420
00:53:18,200 --> 00:53:21,088
This is not over between us.

1421
00:53:21,118 --> 00:53:22,754
Tell me, kris.

1422
00:53:22,784 --> 00:53:23,837
What?

1423
00:53:23,867 --> 00:53:25,129
Why do you hate men so much?

1424
00:53:25,159 --> 00:53:26,837
don't. i don't hate men,

1425
00:53:26,867 --> 00:53:29,379
Karl, just you.

1426
00:53:29,409 --> 00:53:31,129
God, she wants me so fuckin'

1427
00:53:31,159 --> 00:53:32,420
Bad.

1428
00:53:32,450 --> 00:53:34,552
Oh, yes, yes, i can tell.

1429
00:53:36,242 --> 00:53:38,420
You know, i grew up not far

1430
00:53:38,450 --> 00:53:40,462
Away from the isle of lesbos.

1431
00:53:40,492 --> 00:53:42,046
That sounds real nice.

1432
00:53:42,076 --> 00:53:45,046
Right. now listen, fuck face!

1433
00:53:45,076 --> 00:53:46,337
Where's the rest?

1434
00:53:46,367 --> 00:53:47,879
God, it's so spooky when

1435
00:53:47,909 --> 00:53:49,170
You switch like that.

1436
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,212
Yeah? you oughta count

1437
00:53:51,242 --> 00:53:52,379
Yourself real privileged, son,

1438
00:53:52,409 --> 00:53:54,129
Because i've let you see my

1439
00:53:54,159 --> 00:53:55,295
True nature.

1440
00:53:55,325 --> 00:53:56,295
Now where is it?

1441
00:53:56,325 --> 00:53:57,462
Where's what? ow!

1442
00:53:57,492 --> 00:54:01,337
Get in the kitchen!

1443
00:54:01,367 --> 00:54:02,671
just did 5k.

1444
00:54:02,701 --> 00:54:03,754
That's good for a payment,

1445
00:54:03,784 --> 00:54:05,046
Right?

1446
00:54:05,076 --> 00:54:06,587
5k buys you two days, lad.

1447
00:54:06,617 --> 00:54:08,046
I want the balance of

1448
00:54:08,076 --> 00:54:09,379
The 50 grand by the weekend.

1449
00:54:09,409 --> 00:54:10,545
This weekend? come on,

1450
00:54:10,575 --> 00:54:12,545
Kostas, i can't...

1451
00:54:12,575 --> 00:54:14,253
I mean, you fuckin' serious?

1452
00:54:14,283 --> 00:54:15,837
Am i fuckin' serious?

1453
00:54:15,867 --> 00:54:17,504
George, do you think i'm

1454
00:54:17,534 --> 00:54:19,962
Fuckin' serious?

1455
00:54:19,992 --> 00:54:21,046
There you are.

1456
00:54:21,076 --> 00:54:22,962
George thinks i'm serious.

1457
00:54:22,992 --> 00:54:24,170
Now you answer me a little

1458
00:54:24,200 --> 00:54:25,879
Question, young man.

1459
00:54:25,909 --> 00:54:28,046
When you bash the bishop,

1460
00:54:28,076 --> 00:54:30,379
Do you favor the sinister

1461
00:54:30,409 --> 00:54:32,004
Or the dexter?

1462
00:54:32,034 --> 00:54:33,837
What? i don't know.

1463
00:54:33,867 --> 00:54:35,587
Left or right-handed?

1464
00:54:35,617 --> 00:54:36,879
' M right-handed.

1465
00:54:36,909 --> 00:54:38,170
I'm fuckin' right-handed.

1466
00:54:38,200 --> 00:54:39,879
Get that away from me.

1467
00:54:39,909 --> 00:54:41,129
Do his left hand.

1468
00:54:41,159 --> 00:54:42,337
What are you doing?

1469
00:54:42,367 --> 00:54:44,379
You're not... you're not.

1470
00:54:44,409 --> 00:54:46,046
Come on, kostas, i have the

00:54:47,575 --> 00:54:49,212
George, what are you doing?

1473
00:54:49,242 --> 00:54:50,718
I can get the money. no, no!

1474
00:54:52,325 --> 00:54:53,921
Ah, ah, ah, yeah.

1475
00:54:53,951 --> 00:54:57,462
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

1476
00:54:57,492 --> 00:54:58,879
Fuck, fuck.

1477
00:54:58,909 --> 00:55:02,420
Ah! heal, motherfucker.

1478
00:55:02,450 --> 00:55:06,587
One million dollars!

1479
00:55:06,617 --> 00:55:08,587
Let's pack up and go to

1480
00:55:08,617 --> 00:55:10,170
Mexico, like, tonight.

1481
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:11,379
You lookin' at this piece.

1482
00:55:11,409 --> 00:55:13,170
See, this is more your style.

1483
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,046
15 in the mag, one in the pipe,

1484
00:55:15,076 --> 00:55:16,837
Baby, that's right.

1485
00:55:16,867 --> 00:55:18,253
Can i hold it?

1486
00:55:18,283 --> 00:55:19,253
Yeah.

1487
00:55:19,283 --> 00:55:20,420
That's a taurus.

1488
00:55:20,450 --> 00:55:21,545
like that; it's heavy.

1489
00:55:21,575 --> 00:55:22,962
Yeah, it's real heavy.

1490
00:55:22,992 --> 00:55:23,962
What you think?

1491
00:55:23,992 --> 00:55:25,253
How much for this bad-ass

1492
00:55:25,283 --> 00:55:26,253
Sucker?

1493
00:55:26,283 --> 00:55:27,253

1494
00:55:27,283 --> 00:55:28,796
Special today, baby. special.

1495
00:55:28,826 --> 00:55:29,962
Do you have anything for,

00:55:29,992 --> 00:55:31,088

00:55:33,200 --> 00:55:36,337
Yeah, like 100 bucks, cash.

1499
00:55:36,367 --> 00:55:38,170
Look, this is my own personal

1500

Drop piece.

1501
00:55:39,534 --> 00:55:41,212
Okay, this is a .38 special.

1502
00:55:41,242 --> 00:55:42,837
All right?

1503
00:55:42,867 --> 00:55:44,837
See that? now, clean.

1504
00:55:44,867 --> 00:55:46,253
You do that in front of someone,

1505
00:55:46,283 --> 00:55:47,921
That'll scare 'em enough.

1506

I fucking told you to.

1596
00:58:29,701 --> 00:58:33,379
So how do we play it?

You go with him, you

00:58:35,409 --> 00:58:38,004
Frighten the girls,

1599
00:58:38,034 --> 00:58:39,379
You see if they've got anything

1600
00:58:39,409 --> 00:58:42,379
Worthwhile, and you take it.

1601
00:58:42,409 --> 00:58:44,253
Karl's not gonna let us--

1602
00:58:44,283 --> 00:58:46,129

Today, it would not trouble me

00:58:51,409 --> 00:58:54,712
One little bit.

1607
00:58:54,742 --> 00:58:56,088
What does that mean?

1608
00:58:56,118 --> 00:58:57,170
It means we're gonna kill

00:58:57,200 --> 00:58:58,712

Greaseball kostas off my back.

Kostas isn't italian.

1691
01:01:53,784 --> 01:01:55,295
You boys ready?

1692
01:01:55,325 --> 01:01:57,117
Both: yes.

1693
01:02:00,409 --> 01:02:02,159
All fuckin' right.

1694
01:02:23,367 --> 01:02:24,754
What the hell?

1695
01:02:24,784 --> 01:02:26,950
Where's she goin'?

1696
01:02:47,492 --> 01:02:49,034
Hmm.

1697
01:02:50,617 --> 01:02:52,576
Fuckin' hmm.

1698
01:03:03,617 --> 01:03:05,170
What is it with chicks?

1699
01:03:05,200 --> 01:03:06,629
Pack half a house...

1700
01:03:06,659 --> 01:03:07,796
Where the fuck are those

1701
01:03:07,826 --> 01:03:10,034
Assholes?

1702
01:03:13,701 --> 01:03:18,170
And one spanakopita starter.

1703
01:03:18,200 --> 01:03:20,046
Is fine.

1704
01:03:20,076 --> 01:03:21,379
Yes, very good, the water.

1705
01:03:21,409 --> 01:03:23,337
One moment, one moment.

1706
01:03:23,367 --> 01:03:25,295
Any luck?

1707
01:03:25,325 --> 01:03:27,879
Lars, felipe?

1708
01:03:27,909 --> 01:03:32,170

Listen to me, you dipshit.

1711
01:03:36,159 --> 01:03:38,295
This is the lunchtime rush.

1712
01:03:38,325 --> 01:03:40,420
The lunchtime rush is sacred.

1713
01:03:40,450 --> 01:03:42,545
Where are my men?!

1714
01:03:42,575 --> 01:03:44,170
I am one bartender and one

1715
01:03:44,200 --> 01:03:46,088

From three dumb bitches ♪

1723
01:04:07,867 --> 01:04:09,504
Oh, oh, okay.

01:04:09,534 --> 01:04:11,796

Oh, yeah.

That money better be out

1731
01:04:36,367 --> 01:04:39,962
Here, or i'm gonna kill these--

1732
01:04:39,992 --> 01:04:41,129
Kris: sammi, why aren't you

1733
01:04:41,159 --> 01:04:44,170
Digging?

1734
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:45,337
The faster we dig, the faster

1735
01:04:45,367 --> 01:04:48,962
We get the hell outta here.

1736
01:04:48,992 --> 01:04:51,796
Why are they burying it?

1737
01:04:51,826 --> 01:04:55,462
What is this chick, a pirate?

1738
01:04:55,492 --> 01:04:58,004
What are you...

1739
01:04:58,034 --> 01:05:00,295
Sammi, be steady,

1740
01:05:00,325 --> 01:05:02,088
For fuck's sake.

1741
01:05:02,118 --> 01:05:03,337
Jesus, sammi!

1742
01:05:03,367 --> 01:05:05,129
Oh, shit.

1743
01:05:05,159 --> 01:05:07,088
Lars and felipe are in bags.

1744
01:05:07,118 --> 01:05:08,253
That's lars and felipe

1745
01:05:08,283 --> 01:05:09,837
In bags.

1746
01:05:09,867 --> 01:05:11,618
Oh, my god!

1747
01:05:14,951 --> 01:05:16,462
Oh, yeah. oh, my god.

1748
01:05:16,492 --> 01:05:18,129
You're a frickin' genius.

1749
01:05:18,159 --> 01:05:20,462
You're a genius, you're so...

1750
01:05:20,492 --> 01:05:22,295
Oh, you're a genius.

1751
01:05:22,325 --> 01:05:25,046
Guess who's on video now,

1752
01:05:25,076 --> 01:05:28,712
Crazy, fucked-up psycho bitches.

1753
01:05:28,742 --> 01:05:30,420
I got your asses.

1754
01:05:30,450 --> 01:05:32,295
Huh? looksy-lou.

1755
01:05:32,325 --> 01:05:34,129
Looksy here.

1756
01:05:34,159 --> 01:05:37,962
See me? i see you.

1757
01:05:37,992 --> 01:05:39,962
Now i see you close.

1758
01:05:39,992 --> 01:05:42,004
I see you all close up.

1759
01:05:42,034 --> 01:05:43,837
You like that?

1760
01:05:43,867 --> 01:05:45,088
That doesn't work.

1761
01:05:45,118 --> 01:05:48,170
Come on.

1762
01:05:48,200 --> 01:05:50,253
Oh, where you goin' now?

1763
01:05:50,283 --> 01:05:51,420
Where you goin', where you

1764
01:05:51,450 --> 01:05:53,635
Goin'?

1765
01:05:57,118 --> 01:05:59,212
No, no. don't go.

1766
01:05:59,242 --> 01:06:02,326
Stay there. don't...

1767
01:06:07,034 --> 01:06:08,170
All right, gentlemen, this is

1768
01:06:08,200 --> 01:06:09,462
The situation.

1769
01:06:09,492 --> 01:06:12,796
That rat bag karl, whom you all

1770
01:06:12,826 --> 01:06:14,462
Know and loathe,

1771
01:06:14,492 --> 01:06:16,962
Has disappeared, along with

1772
01:06:16,992 --> 01:06:18,796
Our esteemed colleagues, lars

1773
01:06:18,826 --> 01:06:20,004
And felipe.

1774
01:06:20,034 --> 01:06:21,253
Now we are going to search

1775
01:06:21,283 --> 01:06:23,921
Every dive in this bloody town

1776
01:06:23,951 --> 01:06:25,796
Until we find him, and then,

1777
01:06:25,826 --> 01:06:27,879
You are going to stamp

1778
01:06:27,909 --> 01:06:32,088
His nuts off.

1779
01:06:32,118 --> 01:06:34,253
As a great greek once said,

1780
01:06:34,283 --> 01:06:38,088
"Cry havoc, and let slip

1781
01:06:38,118 --> 01:06:41,700
The dogs of war."

1782
01:07:03,450 --> 01:07:05,462
Jesus, sammi, kris said to

1783
01:07:05,492 --> 01:07:06,462
Pack the essentials.

1784
01:07:06,492 --> 01:07:08,337
We're not going to a strip club.

1785
01:07:08,367 --> 01:07:10,253
Shut the fuck up, tara.

1786
01:07:10,283 --> 01:07:11,379
Look, if i'm gonna die, i'm

1787
01:07:11,409 --> 01:07:12,796
Gonna look really, really

1788
01:07:12,826 --> 01:07:14,170
Fuckin' hot when i do.

1789
01:07:14,200 --> 01:07:16,295
And i brought disguises.

1790
01:07:16,325 --> 01:07:18,212
Disguises? we're not spies,

1791
01:07:18,242 --> 01:07:20,212
Dingbat.

1792
01:07:20,242 --> 01:07:22,796
No, she's right. we need to

1793
01:07:22,826 --> 01:07:26,212
Change our appearances.

1794
01:07:26,242 --> 01:07:27,796
Oh.

1795
01:07:27,826 --> 01:07:31,492
That's right. i'm right.

1796
01:07:59,534 --> 01:08:01,004
don't know where he

1797
01:08:01,034 --> 01:08:02,253
Went, man.

1798
01:08:02,283 --> 01:08:05,659
More kicking.

1799
01:08:27,867 --> 01:08:29,796
All right.

1800
01:08:29,826 --> 01:08:32,796
Where are you hot bitches?

1801
01:08:32,826 --> 01:08:34,462
Bingo.

1802
01:08:34,492 --> 01:08:36,462
There the fuck you are.

1803
01:08:36,492 --> 01:08:40,796
That bag must be my cash.

1804
01:08:40,826 --> 01:08:42,962
Damn, i kinda like the hair.

1805
01:08:42,992 --> 01:08:44,962
If they didn't just bury some

1806
01:08:44,992 --> 01:08:46,004
Chopped-up dudes in the woods,

1807
01:08:46,034 --> 01:08:49,962
I'd go for a lesbo sandwich.

1808
01:08:49,992 --> 01:08:51,129
Okay, sammi, let's get you

1809
01:08:51,159 --> 01:08:52,379
Your ticket and get you

1810
01:08:52,409 --> 01:08:54,088
On the road. where to?

1811
01:08:54,118 --> 01:08:55,462
What the fuck are you

1812
01:08:55,492 --> 01:08:56,962
Talking about?

1813
01:08:56,992 --> 01:08:58,004
You're not gonna stay here

1814
01:08:58,034 --> 01:08:59,879
Where people are looking for

1815
01:08:59,909 --> 01:09:01,295
You, are you?

1816
01:09:01,325 --> 01:09:03,046
Whoa. whoa.

1817
01:09:03,076 --> 01:09:05,796
Are you, like, cutting me loose?

1818
01:09:05,826 --> 01:09:07,504
Yeah. yeah, you can't be

1819
01:09:07,534 --> 01:09:09,253
Trusted, so...

1820
01:09:09,283 --> 01:09:11,046
We're gonna give you your share.

1821
01:09:11,076 --> 01:09:12,420
You can do whatever you want,

1822
01:09:12,450 --> 01:09:15,295
But tara and i are leaving town.

1823
01:09:15,325 --> 01:09:17,921
Huh. really?

1824
01:09:17,951 --> 01:09:20,004
Fine.

1825
01:09:20,034 --> 01:09:21,879
Fuck it. whatever.

1826
01:09:21,909 --> 01:09:23,587
Fuck you, fuck you.

1827
01:09:23,617 --> 01:09:24,754
Just give me my fucking half,

1828
01:09:24,784 --> 01:09:26,129
And then i'll be gone.

1829
01:09:26,159 --> 01:09:28,921
What? half? fuck, no.

1830
01:09:28,951 --> 01:09:30,253
No, we've been through way too

1831
01:09:30,283 --> 01:09:31,587
Much to give you more than

1832
01:09:31,617 --> 01:09:32,921
Your share.

1833
01:09:32,951 --> 01:09:36,587
Uh, bitch, my share is half.

1834
01:09:36,617 --> 01:09:38,545
You weren't at the fucking

1835
01:09:38,575 --> 01:09:39,754
Warehouse, and it's not my

1836
01:09:39,784 --> 01:09:41,253
Fault that there's two of you.

1837
01:09:41,283 --> 01:09:42,796
Sammi, i'm gonna tell you--

1838
01:09:42,826 --> 01:09:44,170
No, fuck you! fuck you!

1839
01:09:44,200 --> 01:09:45,253
Don't even try to fucking

1840
01:09:45,283 --> 01:09:46,379
Threaten me, okay, 'cause i'm

1841
01:09:46,409 --> 01:09:47,420
Not as dumb as you think,

1842
01:09:47,450 --> 01:09:48,712
And i'm not fucking scared of

1843
01:09:48,742 --> 01:09:50,420
You anymore, all right?

1844
01:09:50,450 --> 01:09:52,337
Fuck you! i am so sick of

1845
01:09:52,367 --> 01:09:54,754
Your fucking shit.

1846
01:09:54,784 --> 01:09:56,504
Even if you were some kind of

1847
01:09:56,534 --> 01:09:57,671
Fucking crazy paramilitary,

1848
01:09:57,701 --> 01:09:59,712
White trash, jesus freak fucking

1849
01:09:59,742 --> 01:10:01,088
Terrorist bitch, or whatever

1850
01:10:01,118 --> 01:10:02,754
The fuck you are.

1851
01:10:02,784 --> 01:10:05,462
You told? yeah.

1852
01:10:05,492 --> 01:10:07,088
You promised me.

1853
01:10:07,118 --> 01:10:09,129
Kris...

1854
01:10:09,159 --> 01:10:10,587
She was freaking out.

1855
01:10:10,617 --> 01:10:12,420
I had to tell her.

1856
01:10:12,450 --> 01:10:13,671
When you killed those guys...

1857
01:10:13,701 --> 01:10:15,129
Tara, what the fuck?

1858
01:10:15,159 --> 01:10:16,379
You brought blood money into

1859
01:10:16,409 --> 01:10:17,796
My house without even a thought

1860
01:10:17,826 --> 01:10:19,462
For my probation.

1861
01:10:19,492 --> 01:10:20,587
And then, you stole some of that

1862
01:10:20,617 --> 01:10:22,170
Money behind my back, and lied

1863
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,587
To me about it.

1864
01:10:23,617 --> 01:10:25,088
And to top it all off,

1865
01:10:25,118 --> 01:10:27,129
You talked about my past--

1866
01:10:27,159 --> 01:10:28,629
The one thing i fucking

1867
01:10:28,659 --> 01:10:31,671
Begged you never to talk about.

1868
01:10:31,701 --> 01:10:34,129
And what, to sammi?

1869
01:10:34,159 --> 01:10:36,587
To fucking sammi?!

1870
01:10:36,617 --> 01:10:37,796
know.

1871
01:10:37,826 --> 01:10:40,046
God, i'm so sorry, kris.

1872
01:10:40,076 --> 01:10:42,420
I did... i mean, sammi and i

1873
01:10:42,450 --> 01:10:45,253
Never meant for this to happen.

1874
01:10:45,283 --> 01:10:49,253

We will divide the money

1878
01:10:59,701 --> 01:11:00,921
By three, and we'll all go

1879
01:11:00,951 --> 01:11:01,921

The money!

1939
01:13:13,701 --> 01:13:14,671
It doesn't matter.

1940
01:13:14,701 --> 01:13:15,754
Of course it matters.

1941
01:13:15,784 --> 01:13:17,088
It doesn't. all we had to

1942
01:13:17,118 --> 01:13:18,629
Fucking do was trust each other.

1943
01:13:18,659 --> 01:13:19,837
Tara, you and i couldn't even

1944
01:13:19,867 --> 01:13:21,046

1945
01:13:21,076 --> 01:13:22,337
Kris...

1946
01:13:22,367 --> 01:13:23,337
Karl wants the money, so

We saw your car parked

1961
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:41,420
Behind the dumpster.

1962
01:14:41,450 --> 01:14:42,462
Isn't it supposed to be hidden?

1971
01:15:12,784 --> 01:15:14,629
' 'm on the p.a. so my voice

1972
01:15:14,659 --> 01:15:16,504
is coming from every direction.

1973
01:15:16,534 --> 01:15:19,420
you have no way of detecting

1974
01:15:19,450 --> 01:15:21,337
where its true location is

1975
01:15:21,367 --> 01:15:23,635
coming from.

1976
01:15:24,992 --> 01:15:26,545
How did you know...?

1977
01:15:26,575 --> 01:15:28,295
Everyone knows the p.a.

1979
01:15:29,492 --> 01:15:32,088

okay, i'm here, i'm here.

1993
01:16:01,409 --> 01:16:03,712
See, the problem is, that it's

1994
01:16:03,742 --> 01:16:05,088
Not exactly on tape.

1995
01:16:05,118 --> 01:16:06,754
It's on my cell phone.

1996
01:16:06,784 --> 01:16:07,796

Three million? i thought

2005
01:16:17,409 --> 01:16:19,671
It was only one million.

2006
01:16:19,701 --> 01:16:21,046
Well, i guess she lied to

2007
01:16:21,076 --> 01:16:22,212
You, too; it's three.

2008
01:16:22,242 --> 01:16:24,712
Now give me the fucking phone.

01:16:24,742 --> 01:16:27,379

Dude, you were totally gonna

2062
01:17:59,076 --> 01:18:00,337
Be my next stop.

2063
01:18:00,367 --> 01:18:02,754
Got your 100k right here.

2064
01:18:02,784 --> 01:18:04,504
Son, if that is just money,

2065
01:18:04,534 --> 01:18:06,129
That's more than 100k.

2066
01:18:06,159 --> 01:18:07,129
Well, yeah--

2067
01:18:07,159 --> 01:18:08,253
Now where are lars and

2068
01:18:08,283 --> 01:18:09,420
Felipe?

2069
01:18:09,450 --> 01:18:11,088
Karl killed them.

2070
01:18:11,118 --> 01:18:12,879
She's a liar.

2071
01:18:12,909 --> 01:18:14,088
So he wouldn't have to give

2072
01:18:14,118 --> 01:18:15,885
You your money.

2073
01:18:18,951 --> 01:18:20,545
Ah, bollocks to all this.

2074
01:18:20,575 --> 01:18:22,170
I haven't got the time to sort

2075
01:18:22,200 --> 01:18:23,462
This out.

2076
01:18:23,492 --> 01:18:25,159
Kill 'em all.

2077
01:18:49,450 --> 01:18:51,088
All right, you get the girls.

2078
01:18:51,118 --> 01:18:52,671
I'll get karl.

2079
01:18:52,701 --> 01:18:54,700
Karl!

2080
01:19:05,242 --> 01:19:06,712
Get up!

2081
01:19:06,742 --> 01:19:08,504
Shit! okay, come on, baby.

2082
01:19:08,534 --> 01:19:09,712
Baby, we gotta get going.

2083
01:19:09,742 --> 01:19:13,075
Come on.

2084
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,545
Coming, karl.

2085
01:19:20,575 --> 01:19:25,284
Ready or not.

2086
01:19:35,118 --> 01:19:38,618
Don't shoot!

2087
01:20:00,325 --> 01:20:02,671
' M coming for you, karl.

2088
01:20:02,701 --> 01:20:05,170
Come on, baby. come on.

2089
01:20:05,200 --> 01:20:07,046
Here, here.

2090
01:20:07,076 --> 01:20:08,504
Come here, come here.

2091
01:20:08,534 --> 01:20:09,879
Hold this here, tight.

2092
01:20:09,909 --> 01:20:11,801
Put pressure on it.

2093
01:20:13,575 --> 01:20:15,867
Come on.

2094
01:20:23,076 --> 01:20:24,759
I know, i know.

Come on, get in there.

2096
01:21:11,575 --> 01:21:16,212
Fuck you, greaseball!

2097
01:21:16,242 --> 01:21:20,618
Greaseball means italian.

2098
01:21:34,283 --> 01:21:36,379
Did you know that the english

2099
01:21:36,409 --> 01:21:39,379
Language has a number of

2100
01:21:39,409 --> 01:21:41,462
Derogatory epithets that cover

2101
01:21:41,492 --> 01:21:43,462
Almost every race and nation

2102
01:21:43,492 --> 01:21:45,629
On earth, but here's a thought

2103
01:21:45,659 --> 01:21:47,420
I want to leave you with.

2104
01:21:47,450 --> 01:21:52,420
There is no derogatory epithet

2105
01:21:52,450 --> 01:21:54,950
For greek.

2106
01:21:56,242 --> 01:21:57,742
Whatever, dude.

2107
01:22:12,951 --> 01:22:14,462
Bugger me. if it's not

2108
01:22:14,492 --> 01:22:17,212
One thing, it's another.

2109
01:22:17,242 --> 01:22:22,783
Put my money down!

2110
01:22:24,242 --> 01:22:26,700
Get on your knees.

2111
01:23:02,242 --> 01:23:04,676
You fucking shot her!

2112
01:23:41,659 --> 01:23:43,337
It's okay, it's okay.

2113
01:23:43,367 --> 01:23:44,545
It's okay, it's okay.

2114
01:23:44,575 --> 01:23:46,545
It's okay, it's okay.

2115
01:23:46,575 --> 01:23:52,159
It's okay, it's okay.

2116
01:23:55,409 --> 01:23:57,962
Come on. okay, okay.

2117
01:23:57,992 --> 01:23:59,879
Careful, careful, okay?

2118
01:23:59,909 --> 01:24:01,337
It's okay, it's okay.

2119
01:24:01,367 --> 01:24:03,921
It's okay. careful, sweetie.

2120
01:24:03,951 --> 01:24:06,004
I know, i know.

2121
01:24:06,034 --> 01:24:07,379
Just lean on me.

2122
01:24:07,409 --> 01:24:10,545
Lean on me.

2123
01:24:10,575 --> 01:24:12,950
You're okay.

2124
01:24:14,951 --> 01:24:17,962
Come on, darlings, come on.

2125
01:24:17,992 --> 01:24:21,504
Nice and gentle now.

2126
01:24:21,534 --> 01:24:23,420
' M so sorry.

2127
01:24:23,450 --> 01:24:25,129
I'm so sorry.

2128
01:24:25,159 --> 01:24:27,135
Shut up!

2129
01:24:28,242 --> 01:24:31,504
All right, that's close

2130
01:24:31,534 --> 01:24:33,117
Enough.

2131
01:24:35,826 --> 01:24:37,671
Where's george?

2132
01:24:37,701 --> 01:24:39,545
Ugly guy, short on words?

2133
01:24:39,575 --> 01:24:40,962
Yeah, that's george.

2134
01:24:40,992 --> 01:24:43,367
Yeah, we killed him.

2135
01:24:44,742 --> 01:24:47,671
You killed george?

2136
01:24:47,701 --> 01:24:50,253
You killed him?!

2137
01:24:50,283 --> 01:24:51,921
Listen, sweetie, i don't give

2138
01:24:51,951 --> 01:24:53,504
A flying fuck about the rest of

2139
01:24:53,534 --> 01:24:56,295
These people, but george

2140
01:24:56,325 --> 01:24:57,712
I liked.

2141
01:24:57,742 --> 01:24:59,088
' M sorry. i really wish

2142
01:24:59,118 --> 01:25:00,295
I hadn't have--

2143
01:25:00,325 --> 01:25:02,545
Shut up!!

2144
01:25:02,575 --> 01:25:05,379
Please. please.

2145
01:25:05,409 --> 01:25:06,879
It's going to be very harda

2146
01:25:06,909 --> 01:25:08,926
To replace george.

2147
01:25:10,409 --> 01:25:11,587
' M sorry about this,

2148
01:25:11,617 --> 01:25:13,545
But the code demands that

2149
01:25:13,575 --> 01:25:15,879
I take revenge for george.

2150
01:25:15,909 --> 01:25:18,004
Nothing personal.

2151
01:25:18,034 --> 01:25:21,534
An eye for an eye.

2152
01:25:28,325 --> 01:25:31,962
Now listen to me very carefully.

2153
01:25:31,992 --> 01:25:38,492
I am out of here with my money,

2154
01:25:38,575 --> 01:25:39,545
Unless you really wanna

2155
01:25:39,575 --> 01:25:44,004
Make a point.

2156
01:25:44,034 --> 01:25:46,576
Thought not.

2157
01:26:10,367 --> 01:26:11,921
She got us into this,

2158
01:26:11,951 --> 01:26:15,379
And she nearly got us killed.

2159
01:26:15,409 --> 01:26:19,046
She didn't deserve this.

2160
01:26:19,076 --> 01:26:20,962
Kris.

2161
01:26:20,992 --> 01:26:22,088
Oh, fuck, baby.

2162
01:26:22,118 --> 01:26:23,992
No, no.

2163
01:26:25,909 --> 01:26:27,504
It's so cold.

2164
01:26:27,534 --> 01:26:29,004

2165
01:26:29,034 --> 01:26:30,837
Wait. just wait, okay?

2166
01:26:30,867 --> 01:26:32,295
Tara, i need you to fight

01:26:32,325 --> 01:26:33,295

Fight for us, baby.

2169
01:26:34,951 --> 01:26:36,295
Come on, fight for our dream.

2171
01:26:37,575 --> 01:26:39,545
Baby, don't worry about that.

2172
01:26:39,575 --> 01:26:40,962
' M sorry.

2173
01:26:40,992 --> 01:26:42,921

In mexico, okay?
