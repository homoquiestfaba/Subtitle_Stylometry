You may not believe that, but there are.
Absolutely.

you naked after you were two.

00:29:26,807 --> 00:29:28,548
Lily, that's enough.

512
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:31,555
All I'm trying to say...

513
00:29:32,229 --> 00:29:35,393
is that nudity isn't
inherently sexual.

514
00:29:35,816 --> 00:29:37,808
And it's the same thing
with these photos.

515
00:29:37,859 --> 00:29:41,398
They're not sexual.
It's you guys that are making them sexual.

516
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:44,189
Okay, just because a young girl is naked,
doesn't mean it's sexual

517
00:29:44,241 --> 00:29:45,322
or creepy or pervy.

518
00:29:45,367 --> 00:29:47,324
And it doesn't make him
a child molester.

519
00:29:47,369 --> 00:29:49,577
Lily, give me a break.

520
00:29:49,621 --> 00:29:52,364
Mom, there's a naked photo of me on
the mantelpiece at two years old.

521
00:29:52,416 --> 00:29:54,658
Do you think
that is child pornography?

522
00:29:54,710 --> 00:29:58,454
Lily, I am not going to sit here and
listen to you defend a child molester.

523
00:29:58,505 --> 00:30:00,858
[Lily] But that's my point,
he's not a child molester. [scoffs]

524
00:30:00,882 --> 00:30:03,795
He is a victim in this.
Just like his daughter.

525
00:30:04,261 --> 00:30:06,173
Lily, you like to debate.

526
00:30:06,221 --> 00:30:08,008
And I respect that.

527
00:30:08,056 --> 00:30:09,701
You want to play devil's advocate.
You're smart.

528
00:30:09,725 --> 00:30:12,559
You don't know the first thing
about this world, sweetheart.

529
00:30:12,602 --> 00:30:17,393
And you call us prudes, old-fashioned,
but I'm gonna tell you something.

530
00:30:17,441 --> 00:30:19,398
I've been
on this earth 45 years,

531
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:20,809
and if there's one thing I know,

532
00:30:20,861 --> 00:30:23,023
men will be men,
girls will be girls,

533
00:30:23,071 --> 00:30:26,235
and until you can protect yourself,
I'm going to do that for you.

534
00:30:26,283 --> 00:30:27,524
[stabs at plate, exhales]

535
00:30:29,077 --> 00:30:30,077
[Lily] Wow.

536
00:30:36,043 --> 00:30:37,043
[door slams]

537
00:30:39,629 --> 00:30:43,122
You guys ever see that video of
the family on safari in Africa?

538
00:30:43,175 --> 00:30:45,918
And they get mauled
by like seven tigers?

539
00:30:47,095 --> 00:30:48,095
No, Donny.

540
00:30:49,014 --> 00:30:50,014
I missed it.

541
00:30:55,395 --> 00:30:56,727
It's pretty cool.

542
00:31:02,444 --> 00:31:03,901
[soft electronic music playing]

543
00:31:18,710 --> 00:31:19,791
[sent text tone]

544
00:31:20,712 --> 00:31:21,712
[dog barking in distance]

545
00:31:23,048 --> 00:31:24,048
[sent text tone]

546
00:31:25,717 --> 00:31:28,050
[keyboard clacking]

547
00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:30,045
[received text tone]

548
00:31:33,683 --> 00:31:34,683
[sent text tone]

549
00:31:49,282 --> 00:31:51,820
[keyboard clacking]

550
00:31:58,291 --> 00:31:59,782
[message received tone]

551
00:32:29,448 --> 00:32:30,564
[message received tone]

552
00:32:55,390 --> 00:32:56,722
Hey, Principal Turrell.

553
00:33:05,066 --> 00:33:06,866
[Sarah]What do you have
to hide anyway though?

554
00:33:07,235 --> 00:33:08,771
Excuse me?

555
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:10,311
Have you seen her...?

556
00:33:10,363 --> 00:33:14,232
I mean, like a million nudes,
super gross porn history,

557
00:33:14,284 --> 00:33:16,321
super pervy texts,

558
00:33:16,369 --> 00:33:20,204
and, like, life-altering shit-talk
about almost everyone at this school.

559
00:33:20,248 --> 00:33:21,248
And my family.

560
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:22,374
[Em] Fair enough.

561
00:33:22,792 --> 00:33:24,499
[Bex] Me too.
[Sarah] Me three.

562
00:33:24,544 --> 00:33:27,161
My iPhoto looks like
a fucking snuff film.

563
00:33:27,214 --> 00:33:28,921
[all laugh]

564
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:31,207
- [Lily] I love you.
- Hopefully nudes...

565
00:33:31,259 --> 00:33:32,295
[sarcastic laughter]

566
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:33,630
[girl 2] What are you doing?

567
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,135
[Bex] Looking
at Turrell's hack.

568
00:33:35,639 --> 00:33:39,007
[Lily] One hundred and forty-two
thousand downloads, that's like...

569
00:33:39,476 --> 00:33:41,183
three times the size of Salem.

570
00:33:41,228 --> 00:33:44,517
[scoffs] I'm sorry, but I just
don't have, like, any sympathy

571
00:33:44,856 --> 00:33:46,643
for people
that get their shit hacked.

572
00:33:47,192 --> 00:33:49,275
[Lily] For real?

573
00:33:49,611 --> 00:33:51,547
Yeah, I mean, there's two types of
people in this world, you know?

574
00:33:51,571 --> 00:33:55,030
Like, the people that have come to
terms with privacy is just dead.

575
00:33:55,075 --> 00:33:56,844
And, like, you know,
then there's the old people

576
00:33:56,868 --> 00:33:58,188
that are still trying
to fight it.

577
00:33:58,912 --> 00:34:01,996
I guess.
[girl 2] I mean, the Internet is amazing.

578
00:34:02,040 --> 00:34:05,954
Like, this guy in Minnesota,
he's like 42, whatever.

579
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:09,666
But basically he subscribed
to my Amazon wish list

580
00:34:09,714 --> 00:34:12,707
and now legit he just buys
me shit all the time.

581
00:34:12,759 --> 00:34:14,250
Why?

582
00:34:14,302 --> 00:34:16,072
I don't know. I guess he just
really likes my Insta, you know?

583
00:34:16,096 --> 00:34:19,214
Like, he likes that I'm real
and, like, I'm cool,

584
00:34:19,266 --> 00:34:21,202
- and, you know, I'm a free soul.
- [girls stifling laughter]

585
00:34:21,226 --> 00:34:24,139
It's really sad,
because basically 90 percent of people

586
00:34:24,187 --> 00:34:28,397
are just so sad and lonely and
have such an unfulfilling life.

587
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:33,190
If I'm, like, inspiring people,
you know, and my life is so cool

588
00:34:33,238 --> 00:34:35,696
and, like, people connect
with me on such a level,

589
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,949
then, like, basically my job
for the day is done.

590
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:42,431
[Bex, stifling laughter] But what's that got
to do with people's shit getting hacked?

591
00:34:42,455 --> 00:34:43,912
- [phone vibrates]
- Oh, hold on.

592
00:34:44,332 --> 00:34:46,494
I gotta get this. Hi, baby!

593
00:34:48,086 --> 00:34:49,086
[Em] Bye, baby!

594
00:34:49,129 --> 00:34:51,121
[Sarah] Um... Okay...

595
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,090
Come here.

596
00:34:54,050 --> 00:34:55,257
Yeah, come here.

597
00:34:56,011 --> 00:34:58,298
I love a little
Princess Leia hair.

598
00:35:01,725 --> 00:35:04,638
[whispered] Carrie, if you're
listening, we miss you.

599
00:35:08,064 --> 00:35:11,398
[administrator] The thing to do is to
go out there and speak from the heart.

600
00:35:11,860 --> 00:35:15,319
Tell the board and the parents what
being principal has meant to you

601
00:35:15,363 --> 00:35:16,979
for the last nine years.

602
00:35:17,032 --> 00:35:20,196
Tell them you understand
their concerns.

603
00:35:21,369 --> 00:35:23,156
And resign with grace.

604
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,169
Mark.

605
00:35:34,674 --> 00:35:35,674
Mark?

606
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:38,421
Hello?

607
00:35:40,347 --> 00:35:41,758
Dude, what are you doing?

608
00:35:42,974 --> 00:35:44,385
- Agh!
- [Lily screams]

609
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,245
- [Lily] What the fuck!
- Oh, yeah, got you now, bitch!

610
00:35:46,269 --> 00:35:47,509
- [Lily] Help me!
- Got you now!

611
00:35:47,604 --> 00:35:49,812
- [wild laughter]
- [Lily gasps]

612
00:35:49,856 --> 00:35:52,690
Oh, my God! You piece of shit.
You should have seen your fucking face.

613
00:35:52,734 --> 00:35:54,350
You piece of shit.
It was a fucking joke.

614
00:35:54,402 --> 00:35:56,985
Goddammit.
Oh, my God. Priceless.

615
00:35:57,030 --> 00:35:58,737
Hey, come here. Come here.

616
00:36:03,995 --> 00:36:05,736
You should have seen
your stupid face.

617
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:07,873
Whatever.

618
00:36:09,250 --> 00:36:10,330
What are you doing tonight?

619
00:36:11,127 --> 00:36:13,744
Em and Sarah might be having
some people over.

620
00:36:13,797 --> 00:36:16,835
Oh, yeah? That's what I heard.
Hmm. Look at you.

621
00:36:16,883 --> 00:36:19,626
Yeah, am I invited?
Hmm...

622
00:36:21,262 --> 00:36:22,594
Guess I can ask.

623
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,430
See you there.
[laughs]

624
00:36:26,101 --> 00:36:27,467
[tense music playing]

625
00:36:42,659 --> 00:36:44,571
[hostile clamoring]

626
00:36:47,080 --> 00:36:48,491
[clamor continues]

627
00:36:57,924 --> 00:36:59,961
I know I've met
a lot of you before.

628
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:02,460
But in light
of the circumstances...

629
00:37:02,512 --> 00:37:04,128
[woman 3] Please, let him speak.

630
00:37:04,556 --> 00:37:05,556
Thank you.

631
00:37:05,932 --> 00:37:08,015
I'd like to just
introduce myself to you.

632
00:37:08,727 --> 00:37:11,014
And tell you
why I became a teacher.

633
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:13,770
- [man 1] Because you're a pedophile!
- [crowd] Yeah!

634
00:37:14,649 --> 00:37:16,481
I grew up not far from here.

635
00:37:16,985 --> 00:37:20,524
In a neighborhood that didn't afford
the same opportunities as Salem.

636
00:37:20,572 --> 00:37:22,529
The schools were underfunded,

637
00:37:22,574 --> 00:37:25,863
the teachers, by and large,
didn't care as much, and...

638
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:30,284
Up until I was a sophomore in high school,
I never even dreamed of going to college.

639
00:37:30,331 --> 00:37:33,699
I was shy and,
to a certain extent, lost.

640
00:37:33,752 --> 00:37:37,541
[man 2] We don't need your fucking
life story, just fucking resign!

641
00:37:38,965 --> 00:37:41,298
[yelling, boos]

642
00:37:41,342 --> 00:37:45,177
[man 2] We fucking trusted you,
and you betrayed that trust.

643
00:37:45,221 --> 00:37:47,158
- [man 1] We saw the pictures!
- [man 2] We gonna stand here

644
00:37:47,182 --> 00:37:49,201
- and listen to this man?
- I will not walk away from these students.

645
00:37:49,225 --> 00:37:50,682
I will not resign!

646
00:37:50,727 --> 00:37:51,808
[man 2] What the fuck?

647
00:37:53,354 --> 00:37:54,435
This piece of shit!

648
00:37:54,481 --> 00:37:55,750
- [Turrell] Just listen...
- [spits]

649
00:37:55,774 --> 00:37:58,232
I will leave it to you,
my community.

650
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:00,984
My community of peers,
I leave it in your hands.

651
00:38:01,613 --> 00:38:03,024
[man 2] Lock him up!

652
00:38:03,072 --> 00:38:04,800
- [crowd takes up chant]
- [crowd] Lock him up!

653
00:38:04,824 --> 00:38:08,534
No matter how salacious
the details are,

654
00:38:08,912 --> 00:38:14,954
I invite you to look at the
context of who I am as a person.

655
00:38:15,502 --> 00:38:19,837
- Lock him up! Lock him up!
- I am not the monster that you think I am!

656
00:38:20,256 --> 00:38:22,088
[man 2] Lock him up!

657
00:38:22,133 --> 00:38:25,592
[crowd continues chanting]
Lock him up! Lock him up!

658
00:38:31,100 --> 00:38:33,808
- [glass shatters]
- [Allison screams] Mom!

659
00:38:33,853 --> 00:38:35,810
[vandal]
Kid molester motherfucker!

660
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:39,557
[chanting continues]

661
00:38:43,488 --> 00:38:46,856
There's no way
the hacker's a student, okay?

662
00:38:46,908 --> 00:38:51,573
He's probably just some like 20-something,
disgruntled-ass loner IT dude

663
00:38:51,621 --> 00:38:54,705
who jacks off to Fight Club in his
mom's basement like every night.

664
00:38:54,749 --> 00:38:56,832
Oh, my God.
Brad Pitt's abs? I can't.

665
00:38:56,876 --> 00:38:58,833
[boy] Why would he come
for Turrell?

666
00:38:58,878 --> 00:39:00,619
[Em] Motive's irrelevant.

667
00:39:00,672 --> 00:39:04,131
What's the motive behind
300 mass shootings every year?

668
00:39:04,175 --> 00:39:06,508
There is none.

669
00:39:06,553 --> 00:39:07,863
People just burn out,
want to take down their little universe.

670
00:39:07,887 --> 00:39:10,550
I just had this scary thought
that, like...

671
00:39:11,558 --> 00:39:14,926
we're all characters onThe Sims
and none of us know it.

672
00:39:15,895 --> 00:39:17,477
[boy] Porn taught me
how to fuck.

673
00:39:17,522 --> 00:39:18,979
But that's the problem.

674
00:39:19,023 --> 00:39:21,060
You think it taught you
how to fuck...

675
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:23,350
It didn't.

676
00:39:23,820 --> 00:39:26,549
This is why every guy I meet on Tinder
wants to choke me on our first date.

677
00:39:26,573 --> 00:39:29,566
[scoffs] I learned how to eat
pussy by watching porn.

678
00:39:29,617 --> 00:39:31,358
[girls laugh]

679
00:39:31,411 --> 00:39:33,323
Just by looking in your eyes,

680
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:35,931
I can tell that you don't know the
first thing about eating pussy.

681
00:39:36,207 --> 00:39:38,620
Whatever.
Guess you'll never know.

682
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:40,586
Tragic.

683
00:39:41,880 --> 00:39:42,996
What about you, Mark?

684
00:39:44,007 --> 00:39:46,465
What?
[Bex] Like eating pussy?

685
00:39:48,511 --> 00:39:49,877
[clears throat] Yeah.

686
00:39:50,513 --> 00:39:51,549
Yeah, I do.

687
00:39:52,223 --> 00:39:53,464
Is that true, Lil?

688
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,556
I'm gonna go to the bathroom.

689
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,613
[whispers] You are such a bitch.

690
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:17,200
I'm not a bitch. I'm a feminist.

691
00:40:17,999 --> 00:40:19,639
[Mark]Do you think it's cool
to be a slut?

692
00:40:21,085 --> 00:40:22,085
Huh?

693
00:40:23,046 --> 00:40:24,378
Keep going.

694
00:40:25,048 --> 00:40:27,335
It's fucking obvious
that you said something to Bex.

695
00:40:27,675 --> 00:40:28,675
Keep going.

696
00:40:29,302 --> 00:40:32,136
I don't know about, like,
me going down on you.

697
00:40:32,180 --> 00:40:33,921
Yeah, about the fact
that you haven't?

698
00:40:34,933 --> 00:40:37,801
What, do you think it's cool
to fucking tell your friends?

699
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:40,515
Let me ask you something, Mark.

700
00:40:40,563 --> 00:40:44,557
You think if I never went down on you,
you might mention it to Mason?

701
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:47,401
Matter of fact, I wouldn't.

702
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,299
I'd just bring it up to you. I'd be like,
"Hey, Lily, why don't you suck my dick?"

703
00:40:50,323 --> 00:40:52,110
Hey, Mark,
why don't you eat my pussy?

704
00:40:52,158 --> 00:40:54,491
Because I'm really fucking angry
at you right now.

705
00:40:55,453 --> 00:40:57,615
[scoffs] How fucking convenient.

706
00:40:58,957 --> 00:41:01,995
[Lily]Mark was the first guy
I ever had sex with,

707
00:41:03,169 --> 00:41:05,627
that I ever snuck out
of my house to meet,

708
00:41:05,964 --> 00:41:07,921
that told me I was beautiful,

709
00:41:08,216 --> 00:41:09,127
that I was smart.

710
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:10,586
Fuck you, Lily!

711
00:41:11,552 --> 00:41:13,885
Fuck you.

712
00:41:13,930 --> 00:41:15,407
- [Lily]That he missed me.
- [Mark] You think you're so fucking cool. Huh?

713
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:17,388
All the fucking time
in your little fucking skirt

714
00:41:17,433 --> 00:41:18,661
and your little fucking panties.

715
00:41:18,685 --> 00:41:20,551
[Lily]That he wanted me.

716
00:41:20,603 --> 00:41:22,873
Outside, dancing with Sarah,
with your tits out and your ass out,

717
00:41:22,897 --> 00:41:24,559
you look fucking ridiculous.

718
00:41:24,607 --> 00:41:26,769
[Lily]That he loved me.

719
00:41:26,818 --> 00:41:29,418
You think you're any different than
any fucking whore on Instagram?

720
00:41:29,737 --> 00:41:33,401
Do you think anyone cares about
what the fuck you have to say?

721
00:41:33,449 --> 00:41:37,193
[Lily]He was the first guy who ever
made me feel good about being me.

722
00:41:37,620 --> 00:41:40,158
You should have
some fucking self-respect.

723
00:41:42,166 --> 00:41:45,534
[Lily]And the first guy
that I ever wanted to hurt back.

724
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:57,930
[Mark]Don't cry, don't cry.
I'm sorry, okay? Hey, you shouldn't cry.

725
00:41:58,391 --> 00:41:59,802
I'm a little drunk.

726
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:05,641
[received text tone]

727
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:11,105
[Mark]You're fucking beautiful
when you cry.

728
00:42:27,462 --> 00:42:30,045
- [kissing sounds]
- [heavy breathing]

729
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:33,423
[instrumental music playing]

730
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:13,501
[door opens]

731
00:43:13,549 --> 00:43:14,735
[woman] Hon, when are you
coming to bed?

732
00:43:14,759 --> 00:43:16,591
[man clears throat] In a bit.

733
00:43:16,928 --> 00:43:19,295
I have some stuff to finish up.

734
00:43:19,847 --> 00:43:22,510
Okay, well, uh,
just don't forget that

735
00:43:22,558 --> 00:43:24,161
you have to take Carlie
to dance in the morning.

736
00:43:24,185 --> 00:43:25,596
Oh, right, yeah.
Okay?

737
00:43:25,645 --> 00:43:27,261
I'll come to bed soon.
Okay, love you.

738
00:43:28,356 --> 00:43:30,643
[door shuts]
Love you more.

739
00:43:37,740 --> 00:43:38,740
[soft moaning]

740
00:43:45,498 --> 00:43:46,784
[distorted audio]

741
00:43:53,381 --> 00:43:54,917
We're gonna start
with tweets here

742
00:43:54,966 --> 00:43:58,334
in which you used
the hashtag "we are legion."

743
00:43:59,971 --> 00:44:03,464
That would seem to insinuate that you're
a member of the hacker group Anonymous.

744
00:44:03,516 --> 00:44:06,054
[laughs] No, I'm not.

745
00:44:06,602 --> 00:44:08,639
No, I just... I'm a supporter.

746
00:44:09,147 --> 00:44:11,309
A supporter? Why?

747
00:44:12,733 --> 00:44:14,474
'Cause they're bad-ass.

748
00:44:14,527 --> 00:44:17,315
And they can do shit that, like,
no offense, but the police...

749
00:44:17,738 --> 00:44:19,900
[clears throat] police can't do.

750
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:22,361
Do you think this is a game?

751
00:44:22,785 --> 00:44:25,949
Ruining peoples' lives,
do you get your kicks from this?

752
00:44:25,997 --> 00:44:27,158
[laughs]

753
00:44:27,790 --> 00:44:29,372
Look up at me
when I'm talking to you.

754
00:44:29,917 --> 00:44:31,499
You know,
it just occurred to me...

755
00:44:31,836 --> 00:44:33,998
You ought to be careful
going after this guy.

756
00:44:35,006 --> 00:44:36,006
Why is that?

757
00:44:36,924 --> 00:44:39,883
I'd think about whether or not
you have anything to hide.

758
00:44:40,595 --> 00:44:41,755
[Patterson] Is that a threat?

759
00:44:42,013 --> 00:44:43,800
It sure sounded like
a threat to me.

760
00:44:44,473 --> 00:44:47,887
Look, I'm just playing this out
to its logical conclusion.

761
00:44:47,935 --> 00:44:49,495
- [phone vibrates]
- [text message ding]

762
00:44:50,146 --> 00:44:52,479
[officer] Your conclusion is
coming real soon. [phone dings]

763
00:44:53,232 --> 00:44:54,689
[laughs loudly]

764
00:44:54,734 --> 00:44:55,850
[more text message dings]

765
00:44:56,652 --> 00:44:59,235
Looks like half of Salem
just got hacked.

766
00:45:00,281 --> 00:45:01,738
[phone slides across table]

767
00:45:02,325 --> 00:45:03,406
[message dings continue]

768
00:45:04,827 --> 00:45:05,988
[Patterson sighs]

769
00:45:06,787 --> 00:45:07,787
[text message ding]

770
00:45:12,501 --> 00:45:13,662
[received text tone]

771
00:45:41,614 --> 00:45:44,652
[Lily moaning on video]

772
00:45:50,665 --> 00:45:51,665
[received message tone]

773
00:45:53,209 --> 00:45:54,245
[received message tone]

774
00:45:57,171 --> 00:45:58,207
[received message tone]

775
00:45:58,256 --> 00:45:59,256
[sniffling]

776
00:46:19,193 --> 00:46:20,980
[sobbing]

777
00:46:25,199 --> 00:46:26,385
- [received message tone]
- [Lily sobs]

778
00:46:26,409 --> 00:46:27,945
[Bex]But how did it start?

779
00:46:29,245 --> 00:46:31,282
I was babysitting for him.

780
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,953
And afterwards,
he'd always give me a ride home.

781
00:46:38,421 --> 00:46:43,166
The only guys that have ever been
into me were like dumb 16-year-olds.

782
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:45,967
In the car rides home, he'd...

783
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:51,344
ask me all these questions that
I've never been asked before.

784
00:46:52,601 --> 00:46:54,809
And he'd listen to what I'd say.

785
00:46:56,022 --> 00:46:58,059
And we never actually hooked up.

786
00:46:59,442 --> 00:47:01,479
There was one thing
that happened...

787
00:47:03,571 --> 00:47:06,860
where he put his hand
on my thigh one time.

788
00:47:11,329 --> 00:47:13,241
And I just melted.

789
00:47:16,167 --> 00:47:17,703
Then I freaked out.

790
00:47:19,670 --> 00:47:20,911
You know, 'cause of...

791
00:47:22,048 --> 00:47:27,043
Carlie and Rose and just
seeing them all the time, and...

792
00:47:28,262 --> 00:47:30,219
I quit babysitting.

793
00:47:32,641 --> 00:47:34,849
Then one night he texted me.

794
00:47:36,896 --> 00:47:38,558
And I wrote back.

795
00:47:39,398 --> 00:47:42,891
But you're 18
and he's, like, 40.

796
00:47:44,695 --> 00:47:48,314
I know,
but I really liked him, Bex.

797
00:47:49,784 --> 00:47:51,446
[softly] He has kids.

798
00:47:53,496 --> 00:47:56,955
- I'm not a bad person, Bex.
- I know, I know.

799
00:47:58,834 --> 00:48:00,120
I love you.

800
00:48:02,088 --> 00:48:03,579
I love you, too.

801
00:48:04,715 --> 00:48:06,126
No matter what.

802
00:48:08,552 --> 00:48:09,963
No matter what.

803
00:48:38,707 --> 00:48:39,948
Have a good day!

804
00:48:44,380 --> 00:48:47,748
[Lily]I read this quote from
this writer whose name I forget.

805
00:48:49,969 --> 00:48:51,176
[phone clicks]

806
00:48:52,221 --> 00:48:53,587
But it said something like,

807
00:48:56,392 --> 00:48:58,930
ten percent
of the population is cruel.

808
00:49:03,441 --> 00:49:04,477
[received text tone]

809
00:49:06,068 --> 00:49:07,980
And, like, ten percent
is merciful.

810
00:49:08,028 --> 00:49:09,028
[received text tone]

811
00:49:19,665 --> 00:49:23,625
And the other 80% can be
swayed in either direction.

812
00:49:27,715 --> 00:49:31,959
I'm also pretty sure that that writer
has never seen a WorldStar fight vid.

813
00:49:32,011 --> 00:49:33,968
Or 4chan or Twitter.

814
00:49:36,265 --> 00:49:37,265
[loud grunt]

815
00:49:39,143 --> 00:49:43,478
Or had their best friend share their
nudes with her boyfriend, and in turn,

816
00:49:43,522 --> 00:49:45,684
the entire fucking school.

817
00:49:45,733 --> 00:49:47,440
[Johnny]Yeah, fuck Diamond.

818
00:49:47,485 --> 00:49:49,245
I can't fucking believe
he sucked Bex's dick.

819
00:49:49,278 --> 00:49:50,485
It's disgusting.

820
00:49:51,697 --> 00:49:54,189
I'm still gagging.
I used to share drinks with that fucker.

821
00:49:55,493 --> 00:49:57,280
[Lily]
But it is scary to think about.

822
00:49:58,579 --> 00:50:00,411
Because you don't know
who's who.

823
00:50:01,874 --> 00:50:04,082
Or how easily
they can be swayed.

824
00:50:06,462 --> 00:50:07,919
And at the end of the day,

825
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:11,547
nothing unites us
like a good tragedy.

826
00:50:14,303 --> 00:50:16,503
[athlete 1] Did you hear when
he's coming back to school?

827
00:50:17,306 --> 00:50:18,306
No.

828
00:50:19,183 --> 00:50:21,675
I give him, like, five days
before he commits suicide.

829
00:50:23,395 --> 00:50:24,806
I would.

830
00:50:29,318 --> 00:50:30,809
[Lily]
And the worse it gets,

831
00:50:31,487 --> 00:50:33,854
the more entertaining
it is for you,

832
00:50:36,075 --> 00:50:37,282
this high school,

833
00:50:37,910 --> 00:50:39,401
this bullshit town,

834
00:50:40,287 --> 00:50:41,778
and the rest of the world.

835
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,071
Can I go to the bathroom?

836
00:50:43,874 --> 00:50:45,706
[Johnny]He's being a little
fucking bitch.

837
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,454
We should do
something about that.

838
00:50:48,087 --> 00:50:49,087
I'll drive.

839
00:50:52,508 --> 00:50:53,840
- I'm in.
- Come on, man.

840
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:55,170
I'm fucking in.

841
00:50:55,844 --> 00:50:56,844
[athlete 2]Me too.

842
00:50:57,471 --> 00:50:59,554
- You in? Yeah?
- Let's fuckin' do it.

843
00:50:59,598 --> 00:51:01,760
What about you?
You?

844
00:51:02,226 --> 00:51:03,262
You fucking in?

845
00:51:03,811 --> 00:51:04,892
You in?

846
00:51:05,312 --> 00:51:06,665
How about you fucking pussies,
you in?

847
00:51:06,689 --> 00:51:07,749
- Yeah!
- Teach Diamond a lesson?

848
00:51:07,773 --> 00:51:08,934
[athlete 3] Let's do it.

849
00:51:08,983 --> 00:51:10,565
[Johnny]Hey, gentlemen.

850
00:51:10,609 --> 00:51:12,521
[clears throat]
What do they call us?

Slay 'em High Killas!

852
00:51:15,406 --> 00:51:18,319
[Johnny]I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
What do they... What do they call us?

00:51:18,367 --> 00:51:19,927
[athletes, louder]
Slay 'em High Killas!

[Johnny]
What do they call us?

855
00:51:22,663 --> 00:51:24,655
What do they fucking call us?

856
00:51:25,124 --> 00:51:26,660
Slay 'em High Killas!

857
00:51:26,709 --> 00:51:28,701
Fuck these pussies!
Fuck these faggots!

858
00:51:54,069 --> 00:51:55,981
[Lily]'Cause it's all
just a movie, right?

859
00:52:15,633 --> 00:52:18,091
[Lily] Hey, what's up?

860
00:52:18,719 --> 00:52:20,426
Come here.
I want to ask you something.

861
00:52:21,639 --> 00:52:22,639
What?

862
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:28,667
Do you have a birthmark
on your back?

863
00:52:30,564 --> 00:52:31,805
- No.
- No?

864
00:52:33,275 --> 00:52:34,607
You sure about that, Lily?

865
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:36,647
Yeah.

866
00:52:37,071 --> 00:52:38,071
[laughs] You're lying.

867
00:52:38,572 --> 00:52:39,858
You're fucking lying.

868
00:52:40,616 --> 00:52:41,616
Show me.

869
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:43,567
No.

870
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:45,576
[metal bat dragging
on ground]

871
00:52:52,670 --> 00:52:53,670
[sharp clang]

872
00:52:55,381 --> 00:52:56,622

874
00:53:03,263 --> 00:53:04,424
[bat continues rolling]

875
00:53:07,101 --> 00:53:09,138
[gasps] What the fuck!

876
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:11,473
- What the fuck are you doing?
- [Mason] Stop fighting.

877
00:53:11,522 --> 00:53:13,333
- Get the fuck off of me!
- Stop fucking fighting, Lily.

878
00:53:13,357 --> 00:53:15,144
What the fuck are you doing?

879
00:53:15,567 --> 00:53:17,024
[Mark shushing]

880
00:53:17,069 --> 00:53:18,229
I want to tell you something.

881
00:53:18,946 --> 00:53:21,905
When I looked through all the
photos in Nick Mathers' leak,

882
00:53:23,117 --> 00:53:24,483
I started to think to myself,

883
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:28,282
"This girl looks
pretty fucking familiar."

884
00:53:28,831 --> 00:53:30,072
[Lily] Don't do this.

885
00:53:30,874 --> 00:53:32,206
What do you think, Lily?

886
00:53:35,504 --> 00:53:36,504
Lily.

887
00:53:36,880 --> 00:53:38,291
- [Lily sobs]
- Look familiar?

888
00:53:39,091 --> 00:53:41,048
- No.
- [Mark] It doesn't, huh?

889
00:53:41,719 --> 00:53:43,530
- [voice breaking] Get off me.
- [Mark] That's what I thought.

890
00:53:43,554 --> 00:53:46,137
I thought there's no fucking way
this could be Lily.

891
00:53:46,181 --> 00:53:48,468
- My little Lily.
- Get the fuck off me.

892
00:53:49,643 --> 00:53:50,884
I just wanna make sure.

893
00:53:53,814 --> 00:53:57,728
So turn around,
be a nice little girl, and show me.

894
00:53:58,819 --> 00:54:00,651
Show me
you're telling the truth.

895
00:54:01,071 --> 00:54:03,233
- Show it.
- Get the fuck off me.

896
00:54:04,158 --> 00:54:05,569
All right.

897
00:54:05,617 --> 00:54:08,200
[Lily gasps]
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

898
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,926
- [sobbing]
- Hold her down, hold her down.

899
00:54:11,582 --> 00:54:13,414
Oh, look. Hold it, hold it.

900
00:54:13,459 --> 00:54:15,325
Yup, there it is!
[laughs]

901
00:54:15,836 --> 00:54:17,543
- [Lily sobs]
- Here.

902
00:54:19,882 --> 00:54:21,123
Wow!

903
00:54:23,844 --> 00:54:26,244
Turn her face around.
Let me get her face in the fucking shot.

904
00:54:26,805 --> 00:54:28,967
Is it wrong that
I'm actually enjoying this?

905
00:54:29,016 --> 00:54:31,599
Didn't you used to
fucking babysit his kids?

906
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:34,556
- Get off me. I don't know. Get off me!
- [Mark] You listen to me.

907
00:54:34,605 --> 00:54:37,222
Now you listen to me.
You fucking humiliated me.

908
00:54:37,274 --> 00:54:39,812
Now it's my turn
to humiliate you.

909
00:54:40,235 --> 00:54:43,854
I'm going to show the whole fucking
world what a dirty whore you are.

910
00:54:44,406 --> 00:54:45,647
Stop fucking crying.

911
00:54:46,450 --> 00:54:48,237
Stop fucking feeling sorry
for yourself.

912
00:54:48,827 --> 00:54:50,284
There's gonna be no sympathy
for you.

913
00:54:50,329 --> 00:54:52,195
You brought this
on your fucking self.

914
00:54:52,956 --> 00:54:54,322
[spits]

915
00:54:57,044 --> 00:54:58,626
[Lily sobs]

916
00:54:58,670 --> 00:55:00,150
[Mark]
Let's get the fuck out of here.

917
00:55:00,798 --> 00:55:02,630
[Lily continues sobbing]

918
00:55:06,345 --> 00:55:08,507
[Mark] The world's gonna know!
[laughs]

919
00:55:28,325 --> 00:55:31,614
[camera shutter clicking]

920
00:55:34,373 --> 00:55:37,366
[clicking accelerates]

921
00:55:41,296 --> 00:55:43,776
The weird thing is,
you don't know how many people have seen it.

922
00:55:44,299 --> 00:55:46,791
You could have them saved
on your computer right now.

923
00:55:46,844 --> 00:55:49,257
You can look them up
after I leave

924
00:55:49,304 --> 00:55:52,092
and share them with
who-the-fuck-ever you want to.

925
00:55:53,100 --> 00:55:56,639
My entire life,
every room that I walk into,

926
00:55:56,687 --> 00:56:00,146
every job interview
or first date,

927
00:56:00,899 --> 00:56:03,562
I'll have that sinking feeling
in my stomach.

928
00:56:05,988 --> 00:56:07,570
So I made a promise.

929
00:56:07,865 --> 00:56:10,152
If I ever found out
who did this to me,

930
00:56:10,200 --> 00:56:12,863
I would hurt them
as much as they hurt me.

931
00:56:12,911 --> 00:56:14,118
[students cheering]

932
00:56:14,162 --> 00:56:15,369
Is that the right thing to do?

933
00:56:16,164 --> 00:56:19,532
I don't know. Don't tell me
it's not justifiable.

934
00:56:20,836 --> 00:56:22,418
It's not like
I fucking killed her.

935
00:56:25,132 --> 00:56:27,294
[phone dings]

936
00:56:27,926 --> 00:56:29,918
[dinging continues]

937
00:56:30,345 --> 00:56:32,382
[dings come faster]

938
00:56:34,433 --> 00:56:36,516
[dinging continues]

939
00:56:38,937 --> 00:56:40,553
Fuck me!

940
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:52,533
[Lawrence] Lillian.

941
00:56:54,912 --> 00:56:55,912
What?

942
00:56:56,705 --> 00:56:58,745
I can't... No, I'm sorry.
I can't do this right now.

943
00:56:59,291 --> 00:57:01,624
Lily, come back here.

944
00:57:03,211 --> 00:57:04,372
Lily?

945
00:57:06,548 --> 00:57:08,130
[Lily] I can't do it right now.

946
00:57:08,842 --> 00:57:09,842
[Rebecca] Lily?

947
00:57:10,385 --> 00:57:11,216
[Lawrence] Lillian.

948
00:57:11,261 --> 00:57:12,593
[doors slamming]

949
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:17,140
Lily?

950
00:57:21,229 --> 00:57:23,374
- I want to ask you a question, Lily.
- Let's not do this now...

951
00:57:23,398 --> 00:57:26,106
I just want to talk to you.
I want to ask you a question.

952
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:28,689
And I want you
to be honest with me.

953
00:57:28,737 --> 00:57:31,215
- Lily. Lily, look at me.
- [softly] Jesus, please don't do this, please.

954
00:57:31,239 --> 00:57:32,821
Lily, I just... I...

955
00:57:33,492 --> 00:57:35,154
I want to know the truth.

956
00:57:35,202 --> 00:57:38,411
Is... Was that you in the photos
on Nick Mathers' phone?

957
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,643
- Lily, look at me. Lily? Look at me.
- Please, don't do this.

958
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:43,533
This is a simple question
I'm asking you.

959
00:57:43,585 --> 00:57:45,577
I am begging you.
Don't do this.

960
00:57:45,629 --> 00:57:48,417
Is that you
in those photos? Lily?

961
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:52,212
Lily, I just want
to know the truth.

962
00:57:52,260 --> 00:57:54,217
Is this you?
Did you do this?

963
00:57:54,262 --> 00:57:56,449
[voice breaking] Stop, stop, stop.
Just stop. Please stop.

964
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:57,964
- Lily.
- Stop.

965
00:57:58,016 --> 00:57:59,882
I'm your mother. I...

966
00:57:59,935 --> 00:58:02,552
You... you are my daughter.
I have spent 18... Look at me.

967
00:58:02,604 --> 00:58:04,846
I have spent 18 years
raising you.

968
00:58:04,898 --> 00:58:06,685
I just want to know the truth.

969
00:58:06,733 --> 00:58:08,941
- Is that you in those photos?
- Dad?

970
00:58:08,986 --> 00:58:10,818
[Lawrence]
Answer the question, Lily.

971
00:58:19,037 --> 00:58:20,037
Yes.

972
00:58:21,873 --> 00:58:22,873
Yes.

973
00:58:23,291 --> 00:58:24,623
- It's you.
- Yes.

974
00:58:26,461 --> 00:58:27,827
What is wrong with you?

975
00:58:29,464 --> 00:58:31,251
What is wrong with you?

976
00:58:32,634 --> 00:58:34,500
How could you do that?

977
00:58:34,553 --> 00:58:36,656
- Now get up. Get up.
- No, please don't make me do this.

978
00:58:36,680 --> 00:58:38,512
Get up right now! Come on.

- Lily?
- I don't want to go.

980
00:58:39,850 --> 00:58:42,263
- [Lily] I love you! I love you!
- No.

981
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:44,205
- Please, I'm so sorry. I love you!

984
00:58:49,234 --> 00:58:51,817
- It's not possible.
- Please let me stay! Don't do this.

985
00:58:51,862 --> 00:58:53,899
Don't do this,

- I'm so sorry.
- [both sigh]

993
00:59:31,151 --> 00:59:32,187
Oh, no way.

That's Lily fucking Colson, dog.

995
00:59:34,112 --> 00:59:35,569
Holy shit.

996
00:59:37,783 --> 00:59:38,783
Yo!

997
00:59:39,451 --> 00:59:40,532
Big fan of your work.

Salem's own little porn star.

999
00:59:45,624 --> 00:59:48,207
Check it out, we're on our way

- Can you blow us a kiss, Lily?
- Leave me the fuck alone.

1004
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:02,075
I know she likes to use her mouth.
I don't know what the problem is.

1005
01:00:02,099 --> 01:00:04,160
- Leave me the fuck alone...
- Come on, Lily, blow us a kiss, baby.

1006
01:00:04,184 --> 01:00:06,767
[Lily] Leave me the fuck alone.

- What's that, bitch?
- Leave me the fuck alone.

1008
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:09,554
Leave me the fuck alone.

1009
01:00:10,065 --> 01:00:11,542
You think any man's
ever gonna wanna fuck

1010
01:00:11,566 --> 01:00:14,309
that nasty pussy of yours
after Googling you?

1011
01:00:14,361 --> 01:00:15,317
Your life is over.

1012
01:00:15,362 --> 01:00:16,523
You ought to just...

1013
01:00:17,030 --> 01:00:18,633
take what you can get
where you can get it.

1014
01:00:18,657 --> 01:00:19,818
You know what I'm saying?

1015
01:00:21,910 --> 01:00:24,072
- So come on and get it, bitch.
- Fuck you.

01:00:41,263 --> 01:00:43,423
[passenger] Where the fuck
you think you're going, Lily?

1022
01:00:44,266 --> 01:00:47,304
Hey, the harder you make me work,
the harder I'm gonna make you hurt, bitch!

1023
01:00:48,395 --> 01:00:49,761
Stupid bitch.

1029
01:01:17,090 --> 01:01:19,127
[Lily] So here's the thing
that really bothers me.

1030
01:01:20,260 --> 01:01:24,004
Who sees a naked photo of a girl
and their first thought is,

1031
01:01:24,055 --> 01:01:26,388
"Yo, I gotta kill this bitch"?

1032
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:28,475
Turns out,

1033
01:01:29,311 --> 01:01:31,473
way more people
than you'd think.

1034
01:01:33,190 --> 01:01:34,190
[cheering]

1035
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:38,050
And I know we're all, like,
a little desensitized to violence.

1036
01:01:39,196 --> 01:01:40,312
And mobs.

1037
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:42,984
And, like, violent mobs.

1038
01:01:43,033 --> 01:01:44,945
[woman]
Were you sorry

1039
01:01:44,993 --> 01:01:46,985
when my husband's dick was
in your fucking mouth?

1040
01:01:47,329 --> 01:01:51,369
[Lily] But when 17,000 people's

1041

1044
01:01:59,841 --> 01:02:02,675

An act of terrorism has been
committed right here in our town.

Let's kill the fucker!

1049
01:02:19,778 --> 01:02:24,648
And the police,
the government, the media

1050
01:02:24,699 --> 01:02:27,942
are either powerless
or complicit.

1051
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:31,324
And the rest of the world
is laughing at us,

1052

in our humiliation.

We will no longer be helpless.

We will root out this terrorist
by any means necessary.

If the government cannot
establish law and order,

1059
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:57,059
then believe me, we will.

we are just going to take the hood off, okay?

1073
01:03:51,619 --> 01:03:54,862
So we all saw when Chief Patterson's
information got leaked...

1074
01:03:55,874 --> 01:03:58,833
We saw your police interview.
We read the transcript.

1075
01:04:00,086 --> 01:04:01,793
I mean, you basically
told 'em you did it.

1076
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,500
No, no, I didn't.

1077
01:04:03,548 --> 01:04:05,540
- I didn't do it, I swear. I swear!
- Kid, no.

1078
01:04:05,592 --> 01:04:07,903
- Do you remember what I said?
- I was just fucking with them.

1079
01:04:07,927 --> 01:04:10,197
- I was just fucking with them!
- Marty, do you remember what I said?

1080
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:11,382
[sobbing] Yes.

1081
01:04:11,431 --> 01:04:13,093
- No... lies.
- No lies.

1083

We know that
you're behind this, Marty.

1084
01:04:19,147 --> 01:04:20,147
We know it.

1085
01:04:20,565 --> 01:04:22,431
[coughing, gasping]

1086
01:04:22,484 --> 01:04:23,565
I swear.

1087
01:04:23,943 --> 01:04:26,230
I swear, I didn't... I swear!

1088
01:04:26,279 --> 01:04:27,279
You didn't do it?

1089
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:29,154
Well, somebody did it, Marty.

1090
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:31,114
And if it wasn't you,
then who was it?

1091
01:04:31,951 --> 01:04:33,613
You need to give us a name.

1092
01:04:33,661 --> 01:04:35,277
Marty, who did it?

1093
01:04:35,330 --> 01:04:37,224
- I don't... I don't know. I don't know.
- Marty...

1094
01:04:37,248 --> 01:04:39,288
I don't know for sure,
but I think it's Lily Colson!

1095
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:40,540
Say that name again.

1096
01:04:40,835 --> 01:04:44,920

Lily Colson.

1097
01:04:44,964 --> 01:04:46,921
You don't know for sure?

1098
01:04:46,966 --> 01:04:51,085
No, no... I was monitoring data
traffic and I saw her IP address.

1099
01:04:52,097 --> 01:04:53,929
Data was off the charts.
I swear, I swear.

1100
01:04:53,973 --> 01:04:56,090
I think... I... It's her, I swear.

1101
01:04:56,810 --> 01:04:59,097
- You better not be fucking with us, Marty.
- I'm not.

1102
01:05:00,271 --> 01:05:01,603
Let's get him cleaned up.

hold back the truth.

01:06:29,694 --> 01:06:33,938
[Em] When I grow up, I wanna be a director
and only make male rape revenge films.

1121
01:06:33,990 --> 01:06:36,448
Like Deliverance?
Ew, no. That's gross.

1122
01:06:36,493 --> 01:06:37,654
I want it to be sexy.

1123
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:40,115
Like, if someone
remade Straw Dogs,

1124
01:06:40,163 --> 01:06:42,516
but instead of Susan George getting raped,
Dustin Hoffman gets raped.

1125
01:06:42,540 --> 01:06:45,408
[Bex] Why hasn't Nancy Meyers,
like, made that already?

1126
01:06:45,460 --> 01:06:47,292
If life were a movie,

1127
01:06:47,337 --> 01:06:49,750
this would be the obligatory
"girl shaves her head" scene.

1128
01:06:49,797 --> 01:06:51,459
Def.

1129
01:06:51,508 --> 01:06:54,125
Actually, no, that would've happened,
like, last week.

1130
01:06:54,177 --> 01:06:58,672
This would be, like, "girl burns this
motherfucking town to the ground" scene.

1131
01:06:58,723 --> 01:07:00,089
That would be dope.

1132
01:07:00,725 --> 01:07:02,466
Girl, I'm glad
this isn't a movie, though.

1133
01:07:02,519 --> 01:07:05,512
'Cause if it was,
you would definitely die at the end.

1134
01:07:05,563 --> 01:07:07,555
Why the fuck do I gotta die?

1135
01:07:07,607 --> 01:07:10,002
'Cause the slut's gotta go, baby.
"'Cause the slut's gotta go."

1136
01:07:10,026 --> 01:07:10,891
Fuck you, guys.

1137
01:07:10,944 --> 01:07:12,105
What the fuck?

1138
01:07:13,071 --> 01:07:15,028
[Lily] What?
Are you guys seeing this right now?

1139
01:07:15,073 --> 01:07:17,565
[Em] What now?
Marty Kolker uploaded a video.

1140
01:07:20,703 --> 01:07:23,070
[Marty on phone]
My name is Marty Kolker.

1141
01:07:23,790 --> 01:07:26,658
I'm not Erostratus.
This wasn't my idea.

1142
01:07:27,377 --> 01:07:29,960
But after Mayor Bartlett's
information was leaked,

1143
01:07:30,004 --> 01:07:32,997
I started to monitor the
amount of data being uploaded

1144
01:07:33,424 --> 01:07:37,088
and downloaded from each IP
address in and around Salem.

1145
01:07:38,304 --> 01:07:39,545
There was one that stood out.

1146
01:07:41,182 --> 01:07:42,514
Lily Colson's.

1147
01:07:45,228 --> 01:07:48,266
I then confronted her about it at school.
What the fuck?

1148
01:07:49,023 --> 01:07:50,980
She not only admitted
to being behind the hack,

1149
01:07:51,025 --> 01:07:53,142
but she also said
that if I didn't help her...

1150
01:07:54,988 --> 01:07:56,980
She said that
if I didn't help her,

1151
01:07:57,031 --> 01:07:58,425
she would release
all my personal information,

1152
01:07:58,449 --> 01:07:59,860
as well as my father's.

1153
01:08:00,451 --> 01:08:02,363
[sobbing]
I'm so sorry.

1154
01:08:02,412 --> 01:08:05,120
I was scared. I didn't know
what else to do. I'm so sorry.

1155
01:08:05,164 --> 01:08:06,371
Why would he say that?

1156
01:08:07,500 --> 01:08:09,812
[Bex] No, this is fucked up.
[Lily] I don't even know how to do this.

1157
01:08:09,836 --> 01:08:12,749
How can he just say that
without showing any proof

1158
01:08:12,797 --> 01:08:14,900
that that even happened?
[Em] Did he just make that shit up?

1159
01:08:14,924 --> 01:08:16,777
Or is, like...
Is it really coming from your house?

1160
01:08:16,801 --> 01:08:18,633
[Bex] Oh, shit.
[Sarah] This isn't good.

1161
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:19,863
[Bex]
Everyone's tweeting about it.

1162
01:08:19,887 --> 01:08:21,799
How many people
are gonna believe this?

1163
01:08:21,848 --> 01:08:23,728
How many people are gonna
think that I did this?

1164
01:08:24,100 --> 01:08:25,591
Did Mom set the alarm, Sarah?

1165
01:08:26,436 --> 01:08:27,802
[Sarah] Uh, I don't know.

1166
01:08:28,438 --> 01:08:29,678
[Em] I think I should go check.

1167
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:43,869
Did you set the alarm?

1168
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:45,528
[Nance] I think so, why?

1169
01:08:46,456 --> 01:08:48,163
I feel anxious. I don't know.

1170
01:08:49,042 --> 01:08:50,578
[Nance] You... You want a Xanax?

1171
01:08:51,169 --> 01:08:52,376
No.

1173

Cannot arm.

1174

[Em] Mom, what's Zone Four?

1175
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:21,147

Is everything okay?
Uh, no, not really.

1185
01:10:03,282 --> 01:10:04,398
Well, can I help?

and you believe it.

1202
01:12:35,560 --> 01:12:39,645
That I really need you to know
that it's not true.

1203
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:42,849
Because I wouldn't hurt people
like this.

1204
01:12:44,402 --> 01:12:48,021
And because of everything that's happened,
I know you're not gonna to believe that.

1205
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:53,325
But... I thought you should
hear it from me directly.

I didn't do this.

1207
01:12:57,039 --> 01:13:00,373
I... I wouldn't wish this
upon anyone.

1208
01:13:02,753 --> 01:13:08,374
And I know that I've made some mistakes,
but I'm... I'm not a bad person.

You know how
they ruined our town.

1263
01:17:36,986 --> 01:17:39,478
Are we gonna sit back

You can't be here.

1283
01:18:30,289 --> 01:18:31,289
Lily.

1284
01:18:31,332 --> 01:18:33,540
[sobs] They killed Nance.

1285
01:18:33,584 --> 01:18:35,826
They killed Nance,
and they took Sarah and Em.

1286
01:18:37,046 --> 01:18:39,286
And they're gonna come for me!
Everything's gonna be okay.

Okay? Let's go upstairs.

Come here, come here.
[continues sobbing]

Hi, hey.

1299
01:19:54,707 --> 01:19:57,996
You're okay. They probably just
took them to the police station.

1300
01:20:00,254 --> 01:20:02,416
We're gonna help, okay?
I promise.

1301
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:05,040
I'm so scared.
I know.

1302
01:20:05,092 --> 01:20:08,256
The whole fucking world
has lost its mind.

[Nick]
You fell in love with me.

1314
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:56,766
Did you think
I was in love with you?

1315
01:20:58,395 --> 01:20:59,476
That's why you did this.

1316
01:21:02,733 --> 01:21:06,898
[whispering] I would never
ever do something like this.

1317
01:21:11,367 --> 01:21:15,111
Tell the fucking truth.

1318
01:21:21,418 --> 01:21:24,411
All this pain and chaos, Lily...

1319
01:21:25,255 --> 01:21:26,255
[Lily gasps]

1320
01:21:27,716 --> 01:21:30,254
[breathing shortens] And I
never even got to fuck you.

1321
01:21:35,516 --> 01:21:37,599
No, no, no, no...

1322
01:21:37,976 --> 01:21:38,976

[Johnny]
First, we're gonna kill you.

1327
01:21:57,246 --> 01:21:58,703
Then the Lacey sisters.

1328
01:22:01,125 --> 01:22:02,125
And then...

1329
01:22:02,835 --> 01:22:05,122
we're gonna kill
that slut Lily Colson.

1330
01:22:10,467 --> 01:22:12,959
Hey, pussy. Get over here.
Tie her up, let's go.

I'm so sorry, Bex.

Please don't do this...

1336

I don't have a choice.

1337
01:22:45,752 --> 01:22:47,209
I'm begging you.

1338
01:22:48,255 --> 01:22:50,747
This isn't you.
You're not like this.

1339
01:22:56,847 --> 01:22:58,634
Please don't do this.

1341
01:23:05,939 --> 01:23:07,555
You want to kiss me, Daddy?

1342
01:23:09,610 --> 01:23:10,610

Yes.

1347
01:23:27,586 --> 01:23:29,578
You promise to be gentle?

1348
01:23:33,217 --> 01:23:34,217

Damn it, Lily!
I wasn't gonna hurt you.

Open the fucking door, Lily!

1359

Open the door.

1360
01:24:25,852 --> 01:24:28,686
It is not what it looks like,
Lily. I didn't kill him.

1361
01:24:29,022 --> 01:24:31,435
What the fuck are you doing?
Open it up.

Open the fucking door, Lily.

1363
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:38,400
Goddammit, Lily,
I wasn't gonna hurt you.

1364
01:24:38,907 --> 01:24:41,866
I have lost everything, okay?
I have nothing.

1365
01:24:42,578 --> 01:24:45,161
Open the door right now
or I'm leaving.

1366
01:24:45,205 --> 01:24:48,243
I need you to open the door
right fucking now!

1367
01:24:48,667 --> 01:24:49,748
Right now!

1368
01:24:51,878 --> 01:24:54,712
Open this fucking door,
you little shit.

1369
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:56,918
[banging]

1370
01:24:57,926 --> 01:24:59,542
Open the fucking door!

1371
01:25:04,016 --> 01:25:05,132
- [lock pops]
- [exclaims]

1372
01:25:10,772 --> 01:25:12,183
[knife slashes]

1373
01:25:16,486 --> 01:25:18,603
[gagging]

1374
01:25:23,952 --> 01:25:25,318
[gasping]

1375
01:25:28,624 --> 01:25:29,624
[head bumps floor]

1376
01:25:33,629 --> 01:25:35,165
[straining, gasping]

1377
01:25:56,818 --> 01:25:58,229
[sobbing]

1378
01:26:03,659 --> 01:26:04,866
[whispering] I'm so scared.

1379
01:26:07,037 --> 01:26:08,699
I don't want to die here.

1380
01:26:09,164 --> 01:26:11,121
[sobbing]
This isn't you, Diamond.

1381
01:26:20,967 --> 01:26:22,208
I'm not gonna do it.

1382
01:26:22,511 --> 01:26:23,672
I'm not gonna tie her up.

1383
01:26:23,720 --> 01:26:24,961
The fuck is wrong with you?

1384
01:26:26,139 --> 01:26:28,677
Look at your life.
She... She ruined it.

1385
01:26:29,101 --> 01:26:30,637
She humiliated you.

1386
01:26:40,153 --> 01:26:41,153
No.

1387
01:26:42,239 --> 01:26:43,901
She didn't humiliate me.
You did.

1388
01:26:52,582 --> 01:26:53,447
[Johnny]
Tie her up.

1389
01:26:53,500 --> 01:26:55,492
[Diamond]
No. Fuck you.

1390
01:26:57,629 --> 01:26:58,995
You're not a hero,
Diamond.

1391
01:27:03,176 --> 01:27:04,587
[grunts]
[thuds]

1392
01:27:04,636 --> 01:27:06,298
One of you motherfuckers
grab him.

1393
01:27:06,346 --> 01:27:08,116
Bring him out in the street.
Let's hang this bitch.

1394
01:27:08,140 --> 01:27:10,678
Let's get this show
on the fucking road, boys!

1395
01:27:49,264 --> 01:27:51,064
[Richter over loudspeaker]
Patriotic citizens.

1396
01:27:52,058 --> 01:27:54,050
Anybody with information

1397
01:27:54,978 --> 01:27:58,722
leading to the whereabouts
or capture of Lily Colson...

1398
01:28:00,525 --> 01:28:04,565
will not only be looked upon as a
hero amongst the good people of Salem

1399
01:28:04,988 --> 01:28:07,230
but will be
most handsomely rewarded.

1400
01:28:23,924 --> 01:28:25,085
What the fuck?

1401
01:28:29,262 --> 01:28:32,300
[Richter over loudspeaker]
Beware, we're gonna find you.

1402
01:28:33,391 --> 01:28:35,223
It's not just me looking.

1403
01:28:35,268 --> 01:28:38,432
It's the town. It's the FBI.

1404
01:28:38,814 --> 01:28:40,350
So you best do the right thing.

1405
01:28:40,398 --> 01:28:42,230
Make it easy on yourself.

1406
01:28:47,364 --> 01:28:49,401
I'm telling you.
She didn't fucking do this.

1407
01:28:49,908 --> 01:28:51,444
[Richter]
You tell that to the FBI.

1408
01:28:52,702 --> 01:28:54,193
They confirmed Marty's story

1409
01:28:54,246 --> 01:28:56,738
about the amount of data
that Lily was uploading.

1410
01:28:57,749 --> 01:28:59,490
Then why aren't they here?

1411
01:29:11,137 --> 01:29:12,344
[tires screech]

1412
01:29:13,181 --> 01:29:14,467
Who the fuck is that?

1413
01:29:19,896 --> 01:29:21,432
Lily, he's gonna kill you!

1414
01:29:29,573 --> 01:29:31,854
You sure you even know how to
hold that thing, little girl?

1415
01:29:39,332 --> 01:29:41,052
What are you gonna do?
You gonna kill a cop?

1416
01:29:41,585 --> 01:29:42,826
[Em] Lily!

1417
01:29:44,129 --> 01:29:45,449
You aren't allowed
to shoot a cop.

1418
01:29:46,548 --> 01:29:49,211
- [groans]
- [both scream]

1419
01:29:49,259 --> 01:29:50,340
[groans]

1420
01:29:54,598 --> 01:29:55,839
[body thuds]

1421
01:29:59,603 --> 01:30:01,060
Em! Sarah!

1422
01:30:01,104 --> 01:30:02,345
[Sarah whimpering]

1423
01:30:03,607 --> 01:30:04,893
Lily...

1424
01:30:04,941 --> 01:30:06,273
[Lily] Are you okay?
[Em] Yeah.

1425
01:30:06,318 --> 01:30:07,900
[Lily]
Are you okay? Are you hurt?

1426
01:30:07,944 --> 01:30:10,311
- [Sarah] I love you.
- Are you okay? I love you.

1427
01:30:10,363 --> 01:30:12,150
I love you both so much.

1428
01:30:12,198 --> 01:30:13,564
[all crying]

1429
01:30:13,617 --> 01:30:16,451
They killed her.
They fucking killed Nance.

1430
01:30:17,162 --> 01:30:18,698
Where's Bex?

1431
01:30:18,747 --> 01:30:20,099
- [engine starts]
- [Johnny] Let's fucking go!

1432
01:30:20,123 --> 01:30:22,080
[tires screeching]
[engine revving]

1433
01:30:22,959 --> 01:30:24,825
Sarah!

1434
01:30:26,546 --> 01:30:28,708
[Johnny, indistinct]

1435
01:30:28,757 --> 01:30:31,420
Let's go!
Slay 'em High, motherfuckers!

1436
01:30:39,017 --> 01:30:40,849
Why?

1437
01:30:41,394 --> 01:30:42,885
[screaming]

1438
01:30:51,571 --> 01:30:54,439
[Johnny] Film this shit.
We gotta show everybody.

1439
01:30:54,491 --> 01:30:56,949
- [athlete] Yeah!
- [Johnny] Spin those tires.

1440
01:30:56,993 --> 01:30:59,485
Slay 'em High,
all right, boys?

1441
01:30:59,537 --> 01:31:03,121
Don't fuck around! Finish it!
Keep going!

1442
01:31:07,504 --> 01:31:09,086
- [horn blares]
- [tires screeching]

1443
01:31:09,130 --> 01:31:11,247
[choking]

1444
01:31:19,307 --> 01:31:20,423
[all yelling]

1445
01:31:44,874 --> 01:31:46,365
Dude, they're fucking crazy.

1446
01:31:56,636 --> 01:31:58,423
I'm gonna take
these bitches out.

1447
01:31:58,471 --> 01:31:59,587
[shouting]

1448
01:32:06,146 --> 01:32:08,103
Fuck this! Fuck!

1449
01:32:30,754 --> 01:32:33,462
If you wanna surrender,
we'll stop shooting.

1450
01:32:35,508 --> 01:32:36,508
[Johnny]
Fuck you, cunts!

1451
01:32:38,344 --> 01:32:40,427
[weapons cocking]

1452
01:32:50,148 --> 01:32:51,148
You're good?

1453
01:32:52,108 --> 01:32:53,895
Yeah.
Fuck!

1454
01:32:59,991 --> 01:33:01,198
Fuck.

1455
01:33:11,169 --> 01:33:12,580
Son of a bitch.

1456
01:33:15,090 --> 01:33:16,090
Okay.

1457
01:33:17,133 --> 01:33:19,591
Okay, all right,
I-I surrender. Don't shoot!

1458
01:33:20,178 --> 01:33:21,714
[pistol clatters]

1459
01:33:22,222 --> 01:33:23,338
Don't shoot, please.

1460
01:33:24,015 --> 01:33:25,222
[Lily] Get on your knees.

1461
01:33:26,684 --> 01:33:29,222
- Get on your fucking knees!
- Okay.

1462
01:33:35,401 --> 01:33:36,608
Don't kill me, please.

1463
01:33:38,530 --> 01:33:39,530
I...

1464
01:33:40,198 --> 01:33:41,439
Pl-Please don't kill me.

1465
01:33:47,789 --> 01:33:50,372
Bex, I'm sorry, okay?
I'm sorry, please.

1466
01:33:51,751 --> 01:33:53,367
[whispers]
Please don't kill me.

1467
01:33:54,838 --> 01:33:56,625
All right, I didn't...
I didn't mean it.

1468
01:33:57,090 --> 01:34:00,629
God, please, Bex. Please, I'm begging you.
Don't fucking kill me.

1469
01:34:02,971 --> 01:34:04,758
Please!

1470
01:34:05,181 --> 01:34:07,423
Look... Look, it was fucking stupid,
all right? I know.

1471
01:34:07,976 --> 01:34:10,162
All right? I'm sorry for everything.
I regret everything.

1472
01:34:10,186 --> 01:34:12,769
I got carried away. I'm sorry.
Please don't fucking kill me.

1473
01:34:15,108 --> 01:34:16,519
Please.

1474
01:34:17,235 --> 01:34:18,521
Hey.

1475
01:34:19,737 --> 01:34:21,444
Please don't fucking kill me.

1476
01:34:31,666 --> 01:34:32,666
Let's go.

1477
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:46,424
Thank you.
[Bex] Mm-hmm.

1478
01:34:50,268 --> 01:34:51,634
You okay?
Uh, yeah.

1479
01:34:52,854 --> 01:34:54,470
[Diamond] You okay?
[Bex] Yeah.

1480
01:34:56,357 --> 01:35:00,317
Thanks for not murdering me,
I guess.

1481
01:35:00,361 --> 01:35:01,647
- [chuckles]
- You're welcome.

1482
01:35:03,781 --> 01:35:04,781
You should go.

1483
01:35:05,742 --> 01:35:06,482
Yeah.

1484
01:35:06,534 --> 01:35:08,321
Yeah, I should.
Yeah.

1485
01:35:08,369 --> 01:35:09,450
Okay.

1486
01:35:18,046 --> 01:35:19,582
[exhales]

1487
01:35:20,131 --> 01:35:21,247
I mean, uh...

1488
01:35:21,883 --> 01:35:22,883
Not all men.

1489
01:35:22,926 --> 01:35:23,926
[laughs]

1490
01:35:26,930 --> 01:35:29,138
[Bex] I don't know what
I'd do without you guys.

1491
01:35:29,182 --> 01:35:30,343
[kissing]

1492
01:35:32,227 --> 01:35:35,766
[Lily] My name is Lily Colson.
I'm 18 years old.

1493
01:35:36,231 --> 01:35:39,599
And I don't know if me and my friends
are gonna live through the night.

1494
01:35:42,237 --> 01:35:44,604
This entire fucking town
wants to kill us.

1495
01:35:46,115 --> 01:35:49,654
And they may say that it's because
they thought I was behind it

1496
01:35:50,078 --> 01:35:51,285
or that I'm a whore,

1497
01:35:51,329 --> 01:35:52,695
I'm immoral, I'm a homewrecker,

1498
01:35:52,747 --> 01:35:54,704
I deserve it, I have it coming.

1499
01:35:55,208 --> 01:35:57,746
Well, guess what?
I didn't hack anybody's shit.

1500
01:35:57,794 --> 01:35:59,831
I didn't do it.
And I don't know who did.

1501
01:36:01,005 --> 01:36:02,871
As for being a whore,

1502
01:36:03,299 --> 01:36:05,211
a homewrecker, immoral?

1503
01:36:05,260 --> 01:36:06,421
Sure.

1504
01:36:08,429 --> 01:36:10,921
It doesn't hold a fucking candle
to your righteousness.

1505
01:36:11,599 --> 01:36:13,056
That's the real sickness here,

1506
01:36:13,101 --> 01:36:15,263
your righteousness
and hypocrisy.

1507
01:36:16,104 --> 01:36:20,348
It's the simple fact that you
can't live by the rules you set,

1508
01:36:20,400 --> 01:36:22,107
yet you still pretend.

1509
01:36:22,860 --> 01:36:25,227
This is your world.
You built this.

1510
01:36:25,863 --> 01:36:28,571
If it's too strict,
tear it the fuck down.

1511
01:36:29,659 --> 01:36:30,945
But don't look at me.

1512
01:36:32,161 --> 01:36:34,744
Don't take your hate out on me.
I just got here.

1513
01:36:36,082 --> 01:36:37,948
[distant gunfire]

1514
01:36:38,001 --> 01:36:40,789
And I have no clue where to go,

1515
01:36:40,837 --> 01:36:44,706
because from the moment I arrived,
all I was ever given were orders.

1516
01:36:46,092 --> 01:36:47,048
Smile.

1517
01:36:47,093 --> 01:36:48,004
Open up.

1518
01:36:48,052 --> 01:36:49,839
Cross your legs.

1519
01:36:49,887 --> 01:36:50,990
Spread your pussy.
[pop song fades in]

1520
01:36:51,014 --> 01:36:52,050
Speak softer.

1521
01:36:52,098 --> 01:36:53,009
Scream louder.

1522
01:36:53,057 --> 01:36:54,264
Be quiet.

1523
01:36:54,309 --> 01:36:55,390
Be confident.

1524
01:36:55,435 --> 01:36:56,551
Be interesting.

1525
01:36:56,602 --> 01:36:58,013
Don't be so difficult.

1526
01:36:58,062 --> 01:36:59,182
[woman vocalizing]
Be strong.

1527
01:37:00,273 --> 01:37:02,230
Be an angel. Be a whore.

1528
01:37:02,275 --> 01:37:03,356
Be a princess.

1529
01:37:03,401 --> 01:37:05,768
Be anything you want to be.

1530
01:37:05,820 --> 01:37:09,313
Even the President of the
United States of America.

1531
01:37:11,159 --> 01:37:12,159
Just kidding.

1532
01:37:14,120 --> 01:37:15,281
Fuck you.

1533
01:37:16,706 --> 01:37:18,288
You still want to kill me?

1534
01:37:19,083 --> 01:37:20,083
Rape me?

1535
01:37:20,543 --> 01:37:21,624
Stab me?

1536
01:37:21,669 --> 01:37:22,705
