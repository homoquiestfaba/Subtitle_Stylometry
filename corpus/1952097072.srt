1
00:00:03,837 --> 00:00:05,771
Wake up, Los Angeles!

2
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:07,864
It's 9:02 A.M.
and already 78°

3
00:00:07,907 --> 00:00:10,102
on another beautiful
September Saturday.

4
00:00:10,143 --> 00:00:12,304
It's definitely gonna be a hot one,
boys and girls.

5
00:00:12,345 --> 00:00:14,711
Break out that sunblock
when you hit the beach.

6
00:00:14,748 --> 00:00:17,979
So get out of bed and let's
get this day started.

7
00:01:42,836 --> 00:01:44,770
Over here.

8
00:01:48,174 --> 00:01:51,302
- Good morning.
- Good morning. What...

9
00:01:51,344 --> 00:01:53,778
- What's with all the suits?
- Some big dealer thing.

10
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:04,815
You got two minutes.

11
00:02:04,858 --> 00:02:06,382
How do you feel?

12
00:02:06,426 --> 00:02:07,950
I'm ready.

13
00:02:07,994 --> 00:02:10,519
You fuckin' better be.

14
00:02:13,266 --> 00:02:14,392
Let's go.

15
00:02:29,582 --> 00:02:31,516
Everybody ready?

16
00:02:31,551 --> 00:02:33,746
Was that a roger,
Roger?

17
00:02:33,786 --> 00:02:35,344
Yeah.

18
00:02:35,388 --> 00:02:38,186
- Let's do it.
- Let's bang a gong.

19
00:02:49,269 --> 00:02:51,965
- You're early!
- What?

20
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:56,805
Get your hands
in the air!

21
00:02:56,843 --> 00:02:59,403
Get your hands up!

22
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:06,011
Oh, fuck.

23
00:03:27,373 --> 00:03:28,362
Shit.

24
00:03:31,077 --> 00:03:34,240
I'm sorry, Mr. Weston.
It's another tough one.

25
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,747
What are you doing here?
You're killing me.

26
00:03:35,782 --> 00:03:36,908
Whoo!
Yeah!

27
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:38,383
That's like 12 in a row.

28
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,319
That must be some
new local record.

29
00:03:41,354 --> 00:03:42,787
Do me a favor?

30
00:03:42,822 --> 00:03:45,757
You know, the next time,
if you would, don't hit on 16.

31
00:03:45,792 --> 00:03:47,157
Don't distract
the other players.

32
00:03:49,596 --> 00:03:51,427
Oh, there you are,
sweetheart.

33
00:03:51,464 --> 00:03:53,762
I thought you might
have gotten lost.

34
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:55,927
Hey, what are you
doing after work?

35
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:58,631
Curing cancer
then grabbing a snack.

36
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:00,832
You know, Chucky,

37
00:04:00,873 --> 00:04:03,068
it's the little
personal touches

38
00:04:03,109 --> 00:04:06,010
that set this place
apart from the rest.

39
00:04:09,349 --> 00:04:10,338
Yes, sir.

40
00:04:10,383 --> 00:04:12,044
I have half a mind

41
00:04:12,085 --> 00:04:14,815
to stop losing my money
at your establishment.

42
00:04:14,854 --> 00:04:17,618
Let's call it a night,
Mr. Weston.

43
00:04:17,657 --> 00:04:19,124
Oh, come on, guys.

44
00:04:19,158 --> 00:04:21,058
I was getting
on a roll here.

45
00:04:21,094 --> 00:04:23,119
Let's not make a scene.

46
00:04:23,162 --> 00:04:26,154
You know the deal. You've sort of worn
out your welcome for the moment.

47
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:29,430
I believe you still have some,
uh, unfinished business

48
00:04:29,469 --> 00:04:31,403
- with...
- Yeah, l... It's okay.

49
00:04:31,437 --> 00:04:34,372
It's okay, 'cause I've
taken care of all that now,

50
00:04:34,407 --> 00:04:36,773
so, if you would
just give me...

51
00:04:36,809 --> 00:04:39,539
a couple hands here,
a chance to win back what I lost...

52
00:04:39,579 --> 00:04:41,479
- Now, Mr. Weston.
- Chuck.

53
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:44,347
Hey hey!
Ow ow ow! Ooh!

54
00:04:46,219 --> 00:04:48,483
What the fuck, Chuck?

55
00:04:49,689 --> 00:04:52,681
You have a nice night,
Mr. Weston.

56
00:04:59,165 --> 00:05:00,996
Sweetie, it's just
two more weeks. I know.

57
00:05:01,034 --> 00:05:02,558
But what's the...?

58
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:04,399
Hon... honey?

59
00:05:04,437 --> 00:05:08,066
Okay, honey, in two weeks
you'll be able to shop until you drop.

60
00:05:10,643 --> 00:05:12,543
But if we don't put
the order in today,

61
00:05:12,578 --> 00:05:15,069
they won't have the Aviator chairs back
in stock for another month.

62
00:05:15,114 --> 00:05:16,775
Sherry, look, don't get
pissed off.

63
00:05:16,816 --> 00:05:19,410
I already explained this to you.
It's just how it has to work.

64
00:05:19,452 --> 00:05:21,682
Roger! You promised me
these types of things

65
00:05:21,721 --> 00:05:23,985
- wouldn't be a problem anymore.
- Listen, Sherry.

66
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:25,490
Jason just walked
in so I'll...

67
00:05:25,525 --> 00:05:28,085
we're gonna talk about
this later tonight, okay?

68
00:05:28,127 --> 00:05:30,857
Sherry?

69
00:05:30,897 --> 00:05:34,264
Sherry, we'll talk about
this later tonight, okay?

70
00:05:34,300 --> 00:05:35,460
I love...

71
00:05:40,673 --> 00:05:41,970
What's up?

72
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:44,306
That's the problem...
nothing's up.

73
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:47,074
And nothing's gonna
go up.

74
00:05:51,584 --> 00:05:52,846
No shit?

75
00:05:52,885 --> 00:05:55,285
Yeah.

76
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:57,721
Oh my fucking God.

77
00:06:22,415 --> 00:06:24,212
What the fuck happened?

78
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:25,842
Check it out yourself.

79
00:06:31,257 --> 00:06:33,191
What the fuck
is this shit?

80
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:43,267
Vinnie, JTS Brown
in a bucket.

81
00:06:43,302 --> 00:06:46,169
Paulie, cash, on the bar.

82
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:56,411
Cold night at the tables?

83
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:59,941
It's fucking Siberia
out there.

84
00:06:59,986 --> 00:07:01,954
But I'm due for
a good run.

85
00:07:01,988 --> 00:07:04,115
How's it going?

86
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,318
- Goes in streaks.
- Streaks?

87
00:07:06,359 --> 00:07:08,350
Yeah, streaks.

88
00:07:09,829 --> 00:07:13,162
The last good streak you had
was six months ago.

89
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:15,030
Now you lost all
your scratch...

90
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,797
you're in debt with these
lovely new friends of yours.

91
00:07:17,837 --> 00:07:19,361
I'm gonna pay 'em.

92
00:07:19,405 --> 00:07:20,963
Like you're gonna
pay your bar bill?

93
00:07:21,007 --> 00:07:22,372
Hey.

94
00:07:22,408 --> 00:07:25,275
I was up almost
100 grand.

95
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:28,212
You know Freddie and
that whole Valari crew.

96
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:31,648
You got a deathwish
or something?

97
00:07:31,684 --> 00:07:33,345
I can't afford it.

98
00:07:33,386 --> 00:07:35,718
You should have stayed
in San Mateo.

99
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,848
Palo Alto.

100
00:07:37,890 --> 00:07:41,382
Whatever it is. I want to know
what keeps you from going back.

101
00:07:41,427 --> 00:07:43,190
It was too much water.

102
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:44,924
The wife?

103
00:07:44,964 --> 00:07:48,297
Well, ex-wife,
I guess.

104
00:07:49,302 --> 00:07:52,829
You are legally retarded.

105
00:07:54,607 --> 00:07:57,974
Aw, you know, seemed like
a good idea and all that.

106
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:00,673
I was finally in a position

107
00:08:00,713 --> 00:08:04,171
where I could give her the kind
of life that she deserved.

108
00:08:04,217 --> 00:08:06,685
I mean, I was making it.

109
00:08:06,719 --> 00:08:07,947
My friend,

110
00:08:07,987 --> 00:08:10,046
you confuse a good run
at the blackjack table

111
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:11,852
for Shangri-La.

112
00:08:11,891 --> 00:08:14,519
Now your life depends on
whether or not

113
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,926
you're gonna take
a hit on 16.

114
00:08:16,963 --> 00:08:19,431
Well, what's the
dealer showing?

115
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:25,227
Hey, Vinnie,
how about another one?

116
00:08:25,271 --> 00:08:26,602
I'm cutting you off, kid.

117
00:08:28,040 --> 00:08:30,838
Aw, come on,
give me a break.

118
00:08:30,877 --> 00:08:32,811
Okay, I'll give
you a break...

119
00:08:32,845 --> 00:08:35,871
in the form of a tip:

120
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:40,249
The Valaris have given you
more rope than they give most.

121
00:08:40,286 --> 00:08:43,016
And if you don't find a way
to pay off these pricks,

122
00:08:43,055 --> 00:08:45,888
they're gonna
hang you with it.

123
00:08:47,093 --> 00:08:49,721
Jesus, Vin,
whatever happened to just

124
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:52,253
plain old "last call"?

125
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:55,260
Paulie.

126
00:09:01,107 --> 00:09:03,940
That's always
brought me luck.

127
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:19,214
Hey hey,
he's on the phone.

128
00:09:19,258 --> 00:09:21,249
Listen, Buster Brown,
when I throw a dog a bone,

129
00:09:21,294 --> 00:09:22,886
I don't want to know
if it's haute cuisine.

130
00:09:22,929 --> 00:09:24,988
Just eat it and say
"Bow-wow."

131
00:09:25,031 --> 00:09:27,522
I don't give a hog's ass
what the analysts say.

132
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:28,761
If you take that deal over mine,

133
00:09:28,801 --> 00:09:30,598
you're gonna feel like a gnat
fucked by a hippo.

134
00:09:33,372 --> 00:09:35,272
Yeah, well, when
your balls clank,

135
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:36,969
call me.

136
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:39,569
Boys, I'm having a shit day.

137
00:09:39,612 --> 00:09:41,170
My housekeeper didn't
wash the socks,

138
00:09:41,213 --> 00:09:43,374
hence I have to wear
black... with blue.

139
00:09:43,416 --> 00:09:45,179
I'm gauche.

140
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:48,316
What?
I'm working here. What?

141
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,221
We were wondering if you noticed
that Markable Metals was down

142
00:09:51,257 --> 00:09:52,849
12 points today.

143
00:09:52,892 --> 00:09:55,122
BF deal. When the
merger closes on Monday,

144
00:09:55,161 --> 00:09:56,719
it'll go
through the roof.

145
00:09:56,762 --> 00:09:58,730
I think you should check
your end-of-the-day reports.

146
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:01,198
- This merger's not closing.
- The hell you say.

147
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:09,069
Gonad.

148
00:10:12,011 --> 00:10:14,639
As soon as one
of these bondholders alerts the SEC

149
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:17,171
that this account is empty,
they're gonna be all over us.

150
00:10:17,216 --> 00:10:18,774
They know we
manage the fund.

151
00:10:18,818 --> 00:10:20,410
Whoa whoa whoa.
I don't manage it.

152
00:10:20,453 --> 00:10:21,681
You and Ed do.

153
00:10:21,721 --> 00:10:23,348
My name isn't in there
as a manager.

154
00:10:23,389 --> 00:10:25,550
I didn't move any money
around except for trades.

155
00:10:25,591 --> 00:10:28,116
No, Stephen, you just created
the bogus corporation

156
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,220
that sold the bogus bonds that we've all
been using the bogus profits of.

157
00:10:31,263 --> 00:10:33,493
Besides that, you should
be free-and-fucking-clear.

158
00:10:33,532 --> 00:10:35,466
Doesn't matter now who
did what to whom.

159
00:10:35,501 --> 00:10:38,561
Once they're onto us,
it'll be a matter of nanoseconds

160
00:10:38,604 --> 00:10:41,664
before they find out we've
been remiss to our bondholders.

161
00:10:41,707 --> 00:10:43,971
So...

162
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,602
So, what do we do?

163
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,909
So you guys get the fuck
out of here and leave it to me.

164
00:10:47,947 --> 00:10:50,245
I'll handle it.
But know this:

165
00:10:50,282 --> 00:10:52,978
if MM is really
going south...

166
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,082
we got ourselves a problem.

167
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:02,458
I should have been a fucking
plastic surgeon.

168
00:11:47,506 --> 00:11:49,804
You should have seen
the way he did that.

169
00:11:49,842 --> 00:11:52,709
Just like on TV.

170
00:11:52,745 --> 00:11:54,508
That really smarts,
doesn't it?

171
00:11:54,547 --> 00:11:57,516
Getting cold-cocked
really fucks you all up.

172
00:11:57,550 --> 00:11:59,541
You get those stars
in front of your eyes.

173
00:11:59,585 --> 00:12:00,677
No fun at all.

174
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:02,950
Freddie?

175
00:12:02,988 --> 00:12:06,685
We have a little
problem here, Paulie.

176
00:12:06,726 --> 00:12:09,718
Personally...

177
00:12:09,762 --> 00:12:12,026
we feel a little hurt.

178
00:12:12,064 --> 00:12:14,191
Don't we, Bennie?

179
00:12:15,201 --> 00:12:17,396
Downright distraught.

180
00:12:17,436 --> 00:12:20,872
We extend our courtesy
to you at my little casino,

181
00:12:20,906 --> 00:12:23,773
making your stay
in our establishment

182
00:12:23,809 --> 00:12:27,404
probably one of the most
enjoyable of your time.

183
00:12:27,446 --> 00:12:29,573
Then your luck changes.

184
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:31,879
You come to us for a loan,
we help you out,

185
00:12:31,917 --> 00:12:34,385
and how do you
repay us? You don't.

186
00:12:36,889 --> 00:12:38,789
Oh, that's rude.

187
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:40,815
That's rude.
I'm not finished. Get him up.

188
00:12:44,630 --> 00:12:47,531
Bennie, stop playing
with him.

189
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:56,403
It's nice to
have you back.

190
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,467
I don't have any money.

191
00:12:58,511 --> 00:13:00,376
I never did.

192
00:13:00,412 --> 00:13:02,642
What about
your car dealership?

193
00:13:06,719 --> 00:13:09,415
You mean you don't own
a car dealership?

194
00:13:09,455 --> 00:13:11,480
No, I never owned it.

195
00:13:11,524 --> 00:13:13,651
I only sold used cars.

196
00:13:15,394 --> 00:13:19,387
Kid, were you born stupid
or did you learn it somewhere?

197
00:13:19,431 --> 00:13:20,955
Huh?

198
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,332
Oh oh, God.

199
00:13:23,369 --> 00:13:26,930
He's so cute, isn't he?

200
00:13:26,972 --> 00:13:29,600
Isn't he, Bennie?

201
00:13:29,642 --> 00:13:31,735
Look, we know
you have nothing.

202
00:13:31,777 --> 00:13:34,439
We know that you thought
you conned us

203
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,041
into believing that you were the...
the "Wheel King."

204
00:13:38,083 --> 00:13:41,018
The little
"Tire King," yeah?

205
00:13:42,087 --> 00:13:44,282
You were pretty good
at first.

206
00:13:44,323 --> 00:13:46,416
As a matter of fact,
for about a minute

207
00:13:46,458 --> 00:13:48,688
we thought you might
be from the Feds.

208
00:13:48,727 --> 00:13:50,490
But...

209
00:13:50,529 --> 00:13:53,054
the minute you started
to lose and you didn't stop,

210
00:13:53,098 --> 00:13:56,295
we knew you were just another punk who
thought he was on a good roll.

211
00:13:56,335 --> 00:13:58,701
So, you see,

212
00:13:58,737 --> 00:14:02,730
we know the best you might
do is some clunker

213
00:14:02,775 --> 00:14:04,743
down in Palo Alto.

214
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:06,972
Oh, yeah.

215
00:14:07,012 --> 00:14:09,810
We know where
you come from.

216
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:14,115
It would take, oh, 20 secondhand cars
to make a dent

217
00:14:14,153 --> 00:14:15,745
in what you owe.

218
00:14:15,788 --> 00:14:17,312
So...

219
00:14:17,356 --> 00:14:19,756
in the course of wondering
how we're gonna deal

220
00:14:19,792 --> 00:14:21,487
with a little...

221
00:14:21,527 --> 00:14:25,395
cheap-shit-
wannabe-bigshot

222
00:14:25,431 --> 00:14:27,626
little fucker

223
00:14:27,666 --> 00:14:29,725
like yourself,

224
00:14:29,768 --> 00:14:33,226
we sent a couple of boys
down there to see

225
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,830
what your situation was...

226
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:37,968
paid a visit to...

227
00:14:40,512 --> 00:14:42,104
Natalie,
I believe it is.

228
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:45,241
- What did you do...?
- Hey.

229
00:14:45,284 --> 00:14:48,082
Do? Paul, what,
you think we're animals?

230
00:14:48,120 --> 00:14:50,611
We're divorced.

231
00:14:50,656 --> 00:14:52,624
Besides, she doesn't
have anything.

232
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,489
Oh, yes, she does.

233
00:14:54,526 --> 00:14:58,986
She has that cute little
blue house all paid for.

234
00:14:59,031 --> 00:15:01,158
You want her to
sell her house?

235
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:03,998
Oh, no.
You want her to sell the house.

236
00:15:04,036 --> 00:15:07,597
No, l... I never owned
the house.

237
00:15:07,640 --> 00:15:08,937
Oh.

238
00:15:10,376 --> 00:15:13,368
Besides, she won't
help me anymore.

239
00:15:13,412 --> 00:15:15,471
But that wouldn't be
our problem, would it?

240
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,539
That would be your problem.

241
00:15:17,583 --> 00:15:19,983
However, if you
can't deliver,

242
00:15:20,019 --> 00:15:23,113
we might be forced
to do something...

243
00:15:23,155 --> 00:15:24,713
very unpleasant.

244
00:15:24,757 --> 00:15:26,748
Look...

245
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:28,225
you know what?

246
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:29,693
Fuck it.

247
00:15:29,728 --> 00:15:31,696
You want to kill me,
go right ahead.

248
00:15:31,730 --> 00:15:34,790
Fuck it. You'll be
doing me a fuckin' favor.

249
00:15:36,201 --> 00:15:39,728
Tempting, but no.

250
00:15:39,772 --> 00:15:42,297
We wouldn't do that,
but we might be forced to...

251
00:15:42,341 --> 00:15:46,334
bring the lovely Natalie
up here for a visit.

252
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:50,212
Of course, she would
be traveling in a bag of kitty litter.

253
00:15:50,249 --> 00:15:51,841
- If you touch her...
- Hey.

254
00:15:55,487 --> 00:15:57,751
Look...

255
00:15:57,790 --> 00:16:01,191
You can't ask her
to sell that house.

256
00:16:01,226 --> 00:16:03,057
That's all she has.

257
00:16:03,095 --> 00:16:05,086
If you have another way

258
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:08,964
of paying
for what is mine,

259
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,492
I'm all for it.

260
00:16:11,537 --> 00:16:15,473
However, you
have one week...

261
00:16:15,507 --> 00:16:17,839
to make things right.

262
00:16:27,953 --> 00:16:29,284
Open it!

263
00:16:33,726 --> 00:16:36,593
Ah... oh!

264
00:16:36,628 --> 00:16:38,095
Shut it.

265
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,661
I know I should say
"I hate to do this,"

266
00:16:42,701 --> 00:16:44,362
but I don't.

267
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:55,777
Fuck.

268
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:57,645
Shit.

269
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:06,455
Shit.

270
00:17:09,728 --> 00:17:11,719
Fuck fuck.

271
00:17:14,133 --> 00:17:16,158
You gonna give yourself
an aneurysm, Roger.

272
00:17:16,201 --> 00:17:17,668
You got to
calm down, son.

273
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:19,796
That ought to be real easy
with you sneaking up on me.

274
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:21,100
What'd you find out?

275
00:17:21,140 --> 00:17:22,664
Well, our info is kosher.

276
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:24,437
The merger was
all set to close.

277
00:17:24,476 --> 00:17:26,137
But the buyers backed off
at the last second

278
00:17:26,178 --> 00:17:29,170
due to a new EPA investigation.
Fucking government.

279
00:17:29,214 --> 00:17:30,772
Stock is down
7.5 points.

280
00:17:33,185 --> 00:17:34,948
That's it then.
We're fucked.

281
00:17:34,987 --> 00:17:36,477
Not necessarily.

282
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:38,387
What do you mean?

283
00:17:38,424 --> 00:17:39,982
What I mean is, until the end of
the month,

284
00:17:40,025 --> 00:17:41,356
when the statements are generated,

285
00:17:41,393 --> 00:17:43,884
nobody but us is hip to the fact
that that account is empty,

286
00:17:43,929 --> 00:17:45,658
which buys us
a little time.

287
00:17:45,697 --> 00:17:46,994
To do what?

288
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:48,693
To raise the gelt,

289
00:17:48,734 --> 00:17:52,192
Roger... the cash, the loot.
What? You want to hear it in French?

290
00:17:52,237 --> 00:17:56,731
Well, you know, I really don't have
my share of the $5 million, Ed.

291
00:17:56,775 --> 00:18:00,575
Oh, wait, I'll just go run
to the ATM and...

292
00:18:00,612 --> 00:18:03,080
We all knew it'd be
a gamble, Roger Dodger.

293
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,015
Well, there's
a tune change, Eddie.

294
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:07,610
You know, what happened to the sure
thing, huh? The inside information.

295
00:18:07,653 --> 00:18:09,314
10 times our money
in a fucking month?

296
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:11,584
You know something, Roger?

297
00:18:11,623 --> 00:18:15,320
You haven't had a blow job in so long,
you forgot how good it tastes.

298
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,351
You know what this
business is. It's volatile.

299
00:18:17,396 --> 00:18:19,762
It's a risk.
It's never a sure thing,

300
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:22,494
and don't fucking ever...
call me Eddie.

301
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:25,401
All right.
Relax, Ed. Jesus.

302
00:18:25,437 --> 00:18:27,667
Relax? I don't know
the etymology of that word,

303
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:29,071
much less its meaning, Rog.

304
00:18:29,108 --> 00:18:31,076
But I do know the meaning
of the word "remember,"

305
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:33,476
as in "recall." Seems to me
I recall someone coming to me

306
00:18:33,512 --> 00:18:35,537
saying, "Anything you got, Ed,

307
00:18:35,581 --> 00:18:39,108
anything you got... under
the table, whatever, Ed. I'm in, Ed!

308
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:41,676
Sherry's giving me
a hard time at home, Ed.

309
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:43,688
I need the money, Ed."

310
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:46,748
You're the numbers guy, Rog.
You dig that little syllogism?

311
00:18:46,792 --> 00:18:48,783
"Sherry need money.

312
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:50,226
Money need Sherry.

313
00:18:50,262 --> 00:18:51,786
Sherry, money, need!"

314
00:18:51,830 --> 00:18:53,889
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

315
00:18:53,932 --> 00:18:55,263
I'm sorry, Ed.

316
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:56,665
Fucking gonad.

317
00:18:56,702 --> 00:18:57,726
Enough.

318
00:18:57,769 --> 00:18:59,498
Things have been
real great

319
00:18:59,538 --> 00:19:02,336
since the money situation
started to improve.

320
00:19:02,374 --> 00:19:03,966
You know?

321
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:06,273
She just needs
a little security.

322
00:19:06,311 --> 00:19:08,677
Women don't need security.
Men only think they do.

323
00:19:08,714 --> 00:19:10,181
Women need three things:

324
00:19:10,215 --> 00:19:13,082
Insurmountable attention,
to be licked, and shoes.

325
00:19:13,118 --> 00:19:14,881
Give me the ball.

326
00:19:19,224 --> 00:19:20,953
Look, if we sell now,
we're what,

327
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:22,893
three-and-a-half,
four million short?

328
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,418
If we're lucky.

329
00:19:24,463 --> 00:19:27,660
Well, that's it, then.
We're fucked.

330
00:19:28,734 --> 00:19:30,565
What if I told you
I got a way

331
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:33,093
to raise the cash
in less than five days?

332
00:19:33,138 --> 00:19:35,402
I'd say you're fucking nuts.

333
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:39,809
Have I ever remotely
resembled someone to you who's sane?

334
00:19:41,280 --> 00:19:43,441
I'll tell you this
though: if we pull it off,

335
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:45,211
get the money back
into the account,

336
00:19:45,250 --> 00:19:46,911
recall the bond,
we're home free.

337
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:50,952
- Two:
- I'm listening.

338
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:52,752
Not here, not now.

339
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,191
You call the boys together.
Meet at my house.

340
00:19:55,227 --> 00:19:57,422
I'll explain
everything then.

341
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,463
Don't worry, Roger Dodger.

342
00:20:04,169 --> 00:20:06,603
It's all gonna be
hunky-dory.

343
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:13,208
Hunky-dory.
Right.

344
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,151
Fucking gonad.

345
00:20:24,723 --> 00:20:25,883
Yeah, this is Max.

346
00:20:25,924 --> 00:20:27,323
Yeah, Colonel,
it's Koster.

347
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:13,866
Can't you answer
the phone? Yeah?

348
00:21:13,905 --> 00:21:17,306
Damn, Paul, I thought
you'd never pick up.

349
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:18,900
Vinnie?

350
00:21:18,944 --> 00:21:21,606
Word is Freddie and her brother
came over to see you last night.

351
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,080
Are you okay?

352
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:25,481
Define "okay."

353
00:21:25,517 --> 00:21:27,280
Hey, what time is it?

354
00:21:27,319 --> 00:21:30,618
It's just after 2:00.

355
00:21:30,656 --> 00:21:31,850
Do you need a doctor?

356
00:21:31,890 --> 00:21:34,154
More like a welder.

357
00:21:34,192 --> 00:21:36,456
Well, I know somebody
in South Lake...

358
00:21:36,495 --> 00:21:37,928
Dr. Charlie Brooks,

359
00:21:37,963 --> 00:21:40,989
off State Line Drive.
Can you get there?

360
00:21:41,033 --> 00:21:44,298
Yeah, I think so.

361
00:21:44,336 --> 00:21:47,931
Vinnie, they... they
want my wife's house,

362
00:21:47,973 --> 00:21:50,032
or they're gonna...

363
00:21:50,075 --> 00:21:53,306
they said they're gonna...
God, I can't even say it.

364
00:21:53,345 --> 00:21:54,642
Them motherfuckers.

365
00:21:54,680 --> 00:21:56,238
And what if
you were able

366
00:21:56,281 --> 00:21:58,306
to come up with
the cash right now?

367
00:21:58,350 --> 00:22:01,808
Well, gee, I lost
the cash fairy's number.

368
00:22:01,853 --> 00:22:04,845
And Nat's through with me.
She won't help me anymore,

369
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:07,791
not... not that I blame her
after what I put her through.

370
00:22:07,826 --> 00:22:09,521
All right all right
all right.

371
00:22:09,561 --> 00:22:12,428
There's always a way out.

372
00:22:12,464 --> 00:22:15,399
Look, I'm...
I'm not gambling.

373
00:22:15,434 --> 00:22:18,130
Meet me at the Hit-and-Miss
when you're done.

374
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,104
I might have
something for you.

375
00:22:20,138 --> 00:22:22,003
I told you, Vinnie,
no more gambling.

376
00:22:22,040 --> 00:22:23,302
Well, this ain't gambling.

377
00:22:50,235 --> 00:22:51,600
Hi, I'm Dr. Brooks.

378
00:22:57,075 --> 00:22:58,542
Broken finger.

379
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:01,705
Did you injure
your vocal cords, too?

380
00:23:02,714 --> 00:23:04,011
Aw, sorry.

381
00:23:04,049 --> 00:23:06,210
l... I was
expecting a man.

382
00:23:06,251 --> 00:23:10,153
Sorry to disappoint you.
Why don't you have a seat, please?

383
00:23:14,359 --> 00:23:16,953
So you were in some
kind of an accident?

384
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:19,589
I closed it in
a car door.

385
00:23:19,631 --> 00:23:21,690
Car door have a name?

386
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:26,566
Look, I know you're doing this
as a favor for Vinnie, so...

387
00:23:26,605 --> 00:23:28,971
Actually, you know,
I would have bought the car door,

388
00:23:29,007 --> 00:23:30,599
so I'm gonna
put that down.

389
00:23:30,642 --> 00:23:33,008
That's about what
it would look like.

390
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:37,504
And what about your nose? You have
a cold or you always sniffle like that?

391
00:23:37,549 --> 00:23:40,074
It got caught in
the door, too.

392
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:43,747
Burns, doesn't it?

393
00:23:43,789 --> 00:23:46,724
Yeah, okay.
Let's go get you an X-ray.

394
00:23:50,695 --> 00:23:53,391
It's a clean break.
You're lucky it didn't splinter.

395
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:55,764
You'll have to leave a brace
on for the next six weeks.

396
00:23:55,801 --> 00:23:57,894
And put some of this
in your nose.

397
00:24:03,175 --> 00:24:04,335
Wow, what is that?

398
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,207
It's a sample.
Keep it.

399
00:24:12,684 --> 00:24:14,811
Here's some painkillers.

400
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:23,159
You know what?
Here's some more.

401
00:24:30,635 --> 00:24:33,103
Feels better just
since you set it.

402
00:24:33,138 --> 00:24:35,129
Yeah, it usually does.

403
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:46,244
So, were you in the army?

404
00:24:46,284 --> 00:24:48,047
Marines, actually.

405
00:24:49,688 --> 00:24:52,589
But those aren't mine.
They belong to my father.

406
00:24:54,826 --> 00:24:57,294
And where's he stationed?

407
00:24:57,329 --> 00:24:59,126
He's dead.

408
00:24:59,164 --> 00:25:01,029
Is that all right?

409
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:05,332
Does that feel
all right?

410
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,832
No... yeah, that's fine.

411
00:25:11,176 --> 00:25:12,905
What's wrong?

412
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:15,174
- No, I'm fine.
- Let me look.

413
00:25:17,716 --> 00:25:19,581
More car injuries?

414
00:25:19,618 --> 00:25:21,677
It was a damn big door.

415
00:25:24,823 --> 00:25:25,847
Ow.

416
00:25:34,633 --> 00:25:37,193
Nothing's broken.

417
00:25:37,235 --> 00:25:40,033
It's just bruised.

418
00:25:40,071 --> 00:25:42,699
So, do you need
a cab home?

419
00:25:42,741 --> 00:25:44,572
Listen,

420
00:25:44,609 --> 00:25:47,203
I'm a little short on cash.

421
00:25:47,245 --> 00:25:50,442
Well, you're in luck. Wednesday is free
auto-related accident day.

422
00:25:50,482 --> 00:25:52,507
Okay.

423
00:26:05,063 --> 00:26:06,826
Anything else?

424
00:26:06,865 --> 00:26:09,698
No. Thank you.
I mean it.

425
00:26:09,734 --> 00:26:11,929
Don't mention it.

426
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,767
Say hello to
Vinnie for me.

427
00:26:13,805 --> 00:26:16,672
And tell him to stop
smoking those damn cigars.

428
00:26:17,709 --> 00:26:20,405
Well...

429
00:26:20,445 --> 00:26:22,470
I'll see you around.

430
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:28,346
Keep that finger out
of harm's way.

431
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:58,079
Listen, this thing
I want to talk to you about...

432
00:26:58,116 --> 00:27:00,516
I think I can help you.

433
00:27:00,552 --> 00:27:03,077
At least I know
a guy who can.

434
00:27:04,689 --> 00:27:05,747
Thanks.

435
00:27:05,790 --> 00:27:09,123
What do I have to do?
Knock somebody off?

436
00:27:11,796 --> 00:27:15,288
Listen, Vinnie, I told you
no more gambling.

437
00:27:15,333 --> 00:27:18,427
And I told you it has
nothing to do with gambling.

438
00:27:18,470 --> 00:27:21,530
But it ain't legal, either.

439
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:24,570
What are you
getting me into?

440
00:27:24,609 --> 00:27:27,476
Look, I know this guy.

441
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,550
He pulls an occasional job
now and then.

442
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,114
He's a pro.

443
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:47,295
Nobody fucking move!

444
00:27:47,332 --> 00:27:49,664
All you cocksuckers
on the ground.

445
00:27:49,701 --> 00:27:53,330
He's got something lined up
where he needs a fourth man.

446
00:27:53,371 --> 00:27:56,272
Don't even think about calling the cops,
you fucking whore.

447
00:27:56,307 --> 00:27:59,140
Get down or I'll blow your
fucking head off

448
00:27:59,177 --> 00:28:02,146
and they'll be mopping your brains off
the goddamn pavement.

449
00:28:03,148 --> 00:28:05,480
Go go go!

450
00:28:05,517 --> 00:28:08,350
Can't move without one.
He's got to move quick.

451
00:28:15,794 --> 00:28:16,988
Wait a minute...

452
00:28:17,028 --> 00:28:18,518
I filled him in.

453
00:28:18,563 --> 00:28:21,031
Says he'll use you
on my recommendation.

454
00:28:21,066 --> 00:28:24,763
And your end will take care
of your immediate problems...

455
00:28:24,803 --> 00:28:26,361
and then some.

456
00:28:26,404 --> 00:28:28,338
This guy is good.

457
00:28:28,373 --> 00:28:30,466
All you have to do
is work with him.

458
00:28:30,508 --> 00:28:31,975
Don't get in the way.

459
00:28:32,010 --> 00:28:35,844
Do what he says
and everything will be easy.

460
00:28:38,049 --> 00:28:40,040
Gentlemen.

461
00:28:56,034 --> 00:28:58,366
It's paper.

462
00:28:59,404 --> 00:29:01,770
You promised us a toy.

463
00:29:01,806 --> 00:29:03,273
Shit.

464
00:29:06,878 --> 00:29:08,175
I'm a little confused here.

465
00:29:08,213 --> 00:29:10,044
Are we talking
about armed robbery?

466
00:29:11,750 --> 00:29:15,015
You're insane.
I can't do that.

467
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,191
You... - 

468
00:29:21,226 --> 00:29:23,660
you got to be
fucking kidding.

469
00:29:25,096 --> 00:29:26,393
l...

470
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:28,160
I think maybe you've
been watching

471
00:29:28,199 --> 00:29:30,258
a little too much
late-night cable, Ed,

472
00:29:30,301 --> 00:29:33,168
but this... this uh...

473
00:29:33,204 --> 00:29:35,195
this ain't
"The Wild Bunch."

474
00:29:35,240 --> 00:29:37,902
Yeah, give me a T1 line
and a keyboard

475
00:29:37,942 --> 00:29:41,275
and I'll make sushi out of a Tokyo
trader's testicles for lunch.

476
00:29:41,312 --> 00:29:42,904
But this?

477
00:29:42,947 --> 00:29:44,915
No no see,
I can't do this.

478
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:47,543
My boys,
it's pretty simple.

479
00:29:47,585 --> 00:29:51,453
The SEC doesn't take kindly
to floating phony bonds.

480
00:29:51,489 --> 00:29:54,822
So unless one of you have
$5 million stuck away in a shoebox,

481
00:29:54,859 --> 00:29:57,384
I suggest we start organizing
and stop bitching.

482
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:59,555
Stephen, what about
your family?

483
00:29:59,597 --> 00:30:01,224
Shit.

484
00:30:01,266 --> 00:30:03,427
Yeah, your dad's
worth a fortune.

485
00:30:03,468 --> 00:30:05,095
Oh, what a marvy idea.

486
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:07,604
Yes, let's call up
Stephen's daddy.

487
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,630
I'm sure the senator
will appreciate that,

488
00:30:09,674 --> 00:30:11,869
especially in
an election year.

489
00:30:11,910 --> 00:30:14,105
Yeah, well, I don't
think that's gonna work out.

490
00:30:14,145 --> 00:30:15,840
"Hello, Daddy,
it's Stephen.

491
00:30:15,880 --> 00:30:18,849
Listen, I was wondering if
you could slip me $5 million

492
00:30:18,883 --> 00:30:21,579
to pay back grandmothers
I bamboozled.

493
00:30:21,619 --> 00:30:23,052
Oh, you can?

494
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:25,817
Well, goodie,
that should about do it.

495
00:30:25,857 --> 00:30:27,449
Bye."

496
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:31,223
That'll go over like a turd
in a punch bowl, brothers.

497
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:34,663
Plus which, there'd be a paper trail
longer than the federal tax code

498
00:30:34,699 --> 00:30:36,667
leading from the senator
right back to us.

499
00:30:36,701 --> 00:30:39,295
And the SEC and
the IRS and the FBI will be following it

500
00:30:39,337 --> 00:30:41,168
like smoke out of
the ass of a semi.

501
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:42,764
My way is clean.

502
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:44,274
My way is complete.

503
00:30:44,309 --> 00:30:46,641
Two weeks from now
we're back at our desks making loot.

504
00:30:46,678 --> 00:30:49,238
Now, that's what you want, isn't it?
Make some loot,

505
00:30:49,280 --> 00:30:51,111
stay out of jail?

506
00:30:51,149 --> 00:30:53,879
If so, this is the way.
This is the only way.

507
00:30:53,918 --> 00:30:55,351
No, God damn it.

508
00:30:55,386 --> 00:30:57,854
Hey hey.
Sit.

509
00:30:57,889 --> 00:31:00,289
- Sit down.
- Yeah.

510
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:02,919
Sit the fuck down.

511
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:06,463
I'm not a thief.

512
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:09,591
I can't put a gun to somebody's head
and say, "Hand it over."

513
00:31:09,634 --> 00:31:13,331
I put my neck on
the chopping block for you

514
00:31:13,371 --> 00:31:16,135
and you're gonna act this way?
What are you gonna do?

515
00:31:16,174 --> 00:31:17,573
Work it off?

516
00:31:17,609 --> 00:31:18,940
If I have to.

517
00:31:29,587 --> 00:31:32,147
What are you gonna do?
Be a pit boss?

518
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,919
A house manager?

519
00:31:33,958 --> 00:31:36,426
A clarinet player?

520
00:31:36,461 --> 00:31:38,486
Jesus,

521
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:41,362
you got nothing else.
You got nothing left.

522
00:31:42,700 --> 00:31:45,794
You're gonna do what
Freddie wants you to.

523
00:31:45,837 --> 00:31:48,533
Offer up your ex's house,
maybe even her,

524
00:31:48,573 --> 00:31:51,542
or get in on this

525
00:31:51,576 --> 00:31:55,034
and settle with Freddie
and have something left over.

526
00:31:57,415 --> 00:32:00,009
Personally, I would suggest
a down payment

527
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:02,144
on a new life
in San Mateo.

528
00:32:02,186 --> 00:32:03,710
Palo Alto.

529
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:07,617
Listen, if you got
a guy on the inside,

530
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:09,991
you know, and he's just
gonna hand 'em over anyway,

531
00:32:10,028 --> 00:32:12,519
why do we got to put on this big show
of robbing the place?

532
00:32:12,563 --> 00:32:16,158
Because my guy
ain't in this

533
00:32:16,200 --> 00:32:18,964
for the shits and
giggles, Roger.

534
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:21,198
My guy needs a robbery.

535
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:22,934
He can't just say,
"Oops, gee,

536
00:32:22,974 --> 00:32:26,068
I lost $15 million worth of diamonds.
Can you send some more over?"

537
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,941
He needs a robbery
with witnesses,

538
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:29,606
with guns, with cops.

539
00:32:29,647 --> 00:32:31,740
Plus which, those diamonds
are gonna be in his shop

540
00:32:31,783 --> 00:32:33,614
for about two hours before
they're allocated

541
00:32:33,651 --> 00:32:34,948
and dispersed to the retailers.

542
00:32:34,986 --> 00:32:38,387
So, this ain't
an absolute lock.

543
00:32:38,423 --> 00:32:40,857
An absolute lock, Jason?

544
00:32:40,892 --> 00:32:43,383
What, have you been going to
Roger's School of the Sure Thing?

545
00:32:43,428 --> 00:32:45,521
No, Jason!
I'm sorry.

546
00:32:45,563 --> 00:32:47,622
I can't come up with
a multimillion dollar

547
00:32:47,665 --> 00:32:50,998
absolute fucking lock!

548
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:53,060
Jesus!

549
00:32:57,976 --> 00:33:01,810
You guys absolutely
fucking slay me.

550
00:33:02,947 --> 00:33:05,177
We log on,
make a few phone calls...

551
00:33:05,216 --> 00:33:07,582
two weeks later,
250 geriatrics

552
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:09,677
hand over their entire
life's savings

553
00:33:09,721 --> 00:33:11,348
and that's okay.
"But gee, Ed,

554
00:33:11,389 --> 00:33:13,084
I don't wanna be
a real crook."

555
00:33:13,124 --> 00:33:15,115
We always intended
to pay that money back, Ed.

556
00:33:15,159 --> 00:33:17,127
And how were we gonna
pay back the money, Stephen?

557
00:33:17,161 --> 00:33:18,628
From the trading account.

558
00:33:18,663 --> 00:33:21,894
And the trading account
is what, Stephen?

559
00:33:21,933 --> 00:33:23,423
It's almost empty.

560
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:25,959
Excuse me?

561
00:33:26,004 --> 00:33:27,995
- Empty.
- Thank you, Stephen.

562
00:33:28,039 --> 00:33:31,065
Your voice was muffled,
you had your head so far up your ass.

563
00:33:31,109 --> 00:33:35,944
The trading account
is empty, earth people.

564
00:33:35,980 --> 00:33:38,676
Which leads me back to
question alpha:

565
00:33:38,716 --> 00:33:41,480
How do we get the scratch?

566
00:33:41,519 --> 00:33:43,680
Which leads me back
to plan A.

567
00:33:43,721 --> 00:33:46,554
Speaking of plan A, Ed...

568
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:48,991
not to look a gift horse
in the mouth...

569
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:52,155
Then don't look a gift horse
in the mouth, Roger.

570
00:33:52,196 --> 00:33:53,959
What, you think
we're the only folks

571
00:33:53,998 --> 00:33:55,761
that need a shitload of
change yesterday?

572
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:58,598
My guy's been waiting for
something like this a long time.

573
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:00,627
A long time... except it's
very difficult

574
00:34:00,671 --> 00:34:02,161
to find folks
who will pull it off.

575
00:34:02,206 --> 00:34:04,970
But we can pull it off, see?
This is it.

576
00:34:05,009 --> 00:34:06,874
So grow up!

577
00:34:06,911 --> 00:34:10,039
You got a better plan?
No, you do not.

578
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:13,539
So, get some balls
that clank,

579
00:34:13,584 --> 00:34:15,984
and let's get to work.

580
00:34:17,955 --> 00:34:20,014
Alrighty?

581
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:29,258
I don't know, Vinnie.
I just can't do it.

582
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:31,200
- Can't do what?
- Play softball.

583
00:34:31,235 --> 00:34:34,170
The bar's forming
a league for softball.

584
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:35,399
Man.

585
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:37,374
You sure fixed
my boy up good.

586
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:39,672
That's what I do.
May I?

587
00:34:39,710 --> 00:34:41,007
Yes yes.

588
00:34:41,045 --> 00:34:43,411
Let me help you there.

589
00:34:43,448 --> 00:34:45,973
Thanks again for...
for everything.

590
00:34:46,017 --> 00:34:48,315
Yeah, car doors
can be hell.

591
00:34:50,221 --> 00:34:51,483
So what brings you here?

592
00:34:51,522 --> 00:34:53,285
I was supposed to
meet some friend

593
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:55,087
after their shift change
at the Valarian.

594
00:34:55,126 --> 00:34:57,151
I think I got stood up.

595
00:34:57,195 --> 00:34:59,220
Yeah, and I saw my
patient over here,

596
00:34:59,263 --> 00:35:02,061
and I thought maybe
I should check up on him.

597
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:05,331
So, how are those
painkillers working?

598
00:35:05,369 --> 00:35:07,894
Oh,

599
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:11,397
a few more minutes, you might be able to
have your way with me.

600
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,070
Why do you think
I came over?

601
00:35:23,554 --> 00:35:25,454
Look, I gotta go.

602
00:35:25,490 --> 00:35:27,958
Good to see you again.
Thanks, Vinnie.

603
00:35:27,992 --> 00:35:30,119
Paul?

604
00:35:30,161 --> 00:35:31,958
I need your answer
tomorrow by noon,

605
00:35:31,996 --> 00:35:33,930
and it better
be positive.

606
00:35:50,815 --> 00:35:52,578
Need a ride,
cowboy?

607
00:35:52,617 --> 00:35:53,982
Aw, no thanks.

608
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:56,077
My horse is
just around the corner.

609
00:35:56,120 --> 00:35:58,714
Come on, get in the car.
You're full of drugs.

610
00:35:58,756 --> 00:36:00,246
You're gonna
kill yourself,

611
00:36:00,291 --> 00:36:01,815
or worse,
your horse.

612
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:04,987
That's okay,
my horse is sober.

613
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:08,487
Hey, I am your doctor.
You have to do what I say.

614
00:36:11,869 --> 00:36:15,134
Listen, I'm sorry I laughed
at you back there, okay?

615
00:36:16,641 --> 00:36:18,268
Hasn't been my week.

616
00:36:18,309 --> 00:36:21,642
Well, the week's
still young.

617
00:36:44,468 --> 00:36:47,369
So, are you
enjoying Tahoe?

618
00:36:50,174 --> 00:36:52,938
I guess you must be really
having a tough time.

619
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,375
Well, for what
it's worth,

620
00:36:57,415 --> 00:36:59,747
I've treated a lot
of Vinnie's friends,

621
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:03,686
but you're the first one
that I've ever given a ride to.

622
00:37:03,721 --> 00:37:05,552
Ah.

623
00:37:05,590 --> 00:37:08,354
So, out of all the losers,
I'm your favorite one.

624
00:37:08,392 --> 00:37:10,485
Without a doubt.

625
00:37:13,764 --> 00:37:16,255
Okay, I gotta ask...

626
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,860
so... so why didn't you
just take the money and run?

627
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:24,704
Well, it's nice to know
Vinnie can keep a secret.

628
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:27,802
Why didn't I just
take the money and run?

629
00:37:27,845 --> 00:37:30,905
Well, I guess the stock
answer to that question is

630
00:37:30,948 --> 00:37:34,008
it's not about the money.
It's about the power, the rush.

631
00:37:34,051 --> 00:37:36,042
Okay.

632
00:37:36,087 --> 00:37:38,180
But that's bullshit.

633
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:40,884
- It is about the money.
- Okay, so...

634
00:37:40,925 --> 00:37:43,485
So, why didn't I just
quit while I was ahead?

635
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:46,428
Ha, 'cause you
never know.

636
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:49,558
The most cash I'd ever
seen in my life

637
00:37:49,600 --> 00:37:51,591
was $2,500,

638
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:55,538
and it was a commissions check,
and that was before taxes.

639
00:37:55,573 --> 00:38:00,135
New Year's Eve,
I was sitting behind $95,000.

640
00:38:00,177 --> 00:38:03,442
Now, three days later,
it was $80,000.

641
00:38:03,481 --> 00:38:06,678
Now, that's pretty good,
but it's not... it's not 95.

642
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:09,686
And so on, and so on,
until it's...

643
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:12,450
it's not just the money
you've lost, but it's the job,

644
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:14,424
the girl,
the self-respect.

645
00:38:14,458 --> 00:38:18,588
- The girl?
- Oh, yeah, there's always a girl.

646
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,563
Wife, actually.

647
00:38:20,598 --> 00:38:23,362
She became part of
all the deals I was making.

648
00:38:23,401 --> 00:38:25,369
Deals?
Deals with who?

649
00:38:25,403 --> 00:38:28,804
Aw, fate, God, whoever.

650
00:38:31,175 --> 00:38:34,201
Natalie, my wife...

651
00:38:34,245 --> 00:38:36,907
she just wanted to
have a family,

652
00:38:36,947 --> 00:38:40,246
and a little house.

653
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:42,149
That wasn't good
enough for me.

654
00:38:42,186 --> 00:38:46,145
I wanted the
American Dream, you know?

655
00:38:46,190 --> 00:38:50,126
I was in a dead-end job
and I came up here on a whim.

656
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:53,324
And I just started
raking in the money.

657
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,127
It was unbelievable.

658
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,760
Okay, so now you had
80 grand...

659
00:38:57,802 --> 00:39:01,329
No, it was only
60 grand at that point.

660
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:03,465
Only.

661
00:39:03,507 --> 00:39:06,101
She begged me to stop.

662
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:09,237
Ah, and I swore
that I would.

663
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,340
But I just knew if I had
one more good run,

664
00:39:12,383 --> 00:39:15,978
I could get all that money back.
I just knew that I could.

665
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:19,683
The sad thing was,
I was still making deals,

666
00:39:19,724 --> 00:39:22,249
even after the money
was all gone

667
00:39:22,293 --> 00:39:24,284
and she had told me
to get lost.

668
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:26,922
- Well.
- Yeah.

669
00:39:26,964 --> 00:39:30,161
It's pretty damn impressive.

670
00:39:40,711 --> 00:39:43,145
- Hello?
- Colonel Max, it's Koster.

671
00:39:43,180 --> 00:39:44,909
- Are we set?
- Yes, sir,

672
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:47,315
we're all set to come through
the door at 0910 hours.

673
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:48,978
Very good.

674
00:39:49,019 --> 00:39:52,147
Remember that you can be inside
no more than two minutes.

675
00:39:52,189 --> 00:39:54,657
That's affirmative, sir.
We're ready.

676
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:58,651
Ah, my contact is set to
get 60¢ on the dollar,

677
00:39:58,696 --> 00:40:01,824
and we will rendezvous at
the safe house in two weeks.

678
00:40:01,866 --> 00:40:03,493
Alrighty,
sounds good to me.

679
00:40:03,534 --> 00:40:07,732
Oh, and Ed, l...
I appreciate this.

680
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:10,502
I would not ask
this of you

681
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:13,203
if there were
any other options.

682
00:40:13,244 --> 00:40:14,871
No need to
explain, sir.

683
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:18,541
I can't say I'm not
having fun.

684
00:40:39,503 --> 00:40:42,904
Look, you kind of
caught me in an off year.

685
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,805
Thanks for the ride.

686
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,742
What, no drink?

687
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:50,980
I don't have
anything here.

688
00:40:51,015 --> 00:40:54,041
l... I just want to make sure
you'll be okay.

689
00:40:55,386 --> 00:40:57,650
Sure.

690
00:40:57,688 --> 00:41:00,316
Would you excuse me
for a minute?

691
00:41:00,357 --> 00:41:02,120
Sure.

692
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:18,469
- It's the best I could do.
- Thank you.

693
00:41:23,047 --> 00:41:26,710
Yeah, I wasn't planning
on entertaining tonight.

694
00:41:36,093 --> 00:41:38,584
Make yourself comfortable.

695
00:41:38,629 --> 00:41:40,995
I always do.

696
00:41:45,102 --> 00:41:46,660
So...

697
00:41:48,172 --> 00:41:50,640
have you lived
in Tahoe long?

698
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,143
About a year.

699
00:41:57,848 --> 00:41:59,543
Do you like it?

700
00:41:59,583 --> 00:42:01,881
Well, take it or leave it.

701
00:42:07,124 --> 00:42:09,752
Was it hard to
become a doctor?

702
00:42:11,729 --> 00:42:15,961
Well, you do have to
go to medical school.

703
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:18,833
Hey, I'm sorry
I brought up your father.

704
00:42:18,869 --> 00:42:20,666
l... I didn't mean to.

705
00:42:20,704 --> 00:42:23,172
Oh, no, that's okay.

706
00:42:24,708 --> 00:42:28,701
I'm just still
very sensitive.

707
00:42:28,746 --> 00:42:32,204
It hasn't been that long
and we were very close.

708
00:42:33,517 --> 00:42:35,542
So, um...

709
00:42:37,888 --> 00:42:40,982
so, how long were
you married?

710
00:42:41,025 --> 00:42:44,722
A little over
three years.

711
00:42:48,098 --> 00:42:49,827
And when did you
get divorced?

712
00:42:49,867 --> 00:42:51,698
Couple of months ago.

713
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,533
- Really?
- Yeah.

714
00:42:55,973 --> 00:42:58,339
And you?
Have you ever been married?

715
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:00,434
No.

716
00:43:00,477 --> 00:43:03,344
No, I never found
the right guy.

717
00:43:04,882 --> 00:43:06,372
Oh.

718
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:09,181
Besides, the...

719
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:12,120
the guys that come
into my office...

720
00:43:12,156 --> 00:43:16,183
they're usually
not my type.

721
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:22,198
And what is your type?

722
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:14,639
Hello?

723
00:45:14,678 --> 00:45:17,579
Paul?

724
00:45:17,614 --> 00:45:20,310
Nat, is that you?

725
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,818
It's me.

726
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:28,988
- Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

727
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:30,687
You?

728
00:45:32,629 --> 00:45:35,325
How... how did you
find me?

729
00:45:35,365 --> 00:45:37,993
Your friends gave
me the number.

730
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:41,762
My friends?

731
00:45:41,805 --> 00:45:44,797
Yeah.
They came by.

732
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:48,141
They were looking at the house,
asking all these weird questions.

733
00:45:48,178 --> 00:45:49,873
Did...
did they do anything?

734
00:45:49,913 --> 00:45:52,313
I thought we were done
with all of this, Paul.

735
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:55,250
You said you'd walk away
and leave me alone.

736
00:45:55,285 --> 00:45:56,547
You said that.

737
00:45:56,587 --> 00:45:58,111
l... l...

738
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:02,319
I know, I'm...
Nat, did... what did they say?

739
00:46:02,359 --> 00:46:05,988
Listen, don't go thinking
you can borrow against the house again.

740
00:46:07,831 --> 00:46:10,800
Look, Nat...

741
00:46:10,834 --> 00:46:13,769
- I'm in... I'm in trouble.
- No no. Not again.

742
00:46:13,804 --> 00:46:17,171
My father left me this house
so I wouldn't have to worry,

743
00:46:17,207 --> 00:46:19,869
and there is no way in hell
I am going to let you ruin that.

744
00:46:19,910 --> 00:46:22,174
l... I'm sorry, Nat...

745
00:46:22,212 --> 00:46:25,010
You... look,
you're in trouble.

746
00:46:25,048 --> 00:46:26,743
Don't start.

747
00:46:35,225 --> 00:46:38,194
It wasn't supposed to
be like this.

748
00:46:38,228 --> 00:46:40,890
I know.

749
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:45,163
I've got a new life now.

750
00:46:45,202 --> 00:46:47,568
Time to move on.

751
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:49,231
I'm... I'm sorry.

752
00:46:49,273 --> 00:46:53,175
I'm sorry. You're right,
I'll take care of it.

753
00:46:54,378 --> 00:46:55,902
I'll leave you alone.

754
00:47:00,484 --> 00:47:03,783
- I miss you, Nat.
- Don't, Paul.

755
00:47:04,788 --> 00:47:06,255
I wish...

756
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:08,349
- What?
- Just...

757
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,421
take care of yourself.

758
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:32,510
Sherry?

759
00:47:37,921 --> 00:47:39,388
Honey?

760
00:47:40,891 --> 00:47:43,155
What the fuck?

761
00:47:43,193 --> 00:47:44,660
Sherry?

762
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,662
This is...

763
00:48:22,432 --> 00:48:23,456
Yeah?

764
00:48:23,500 --> 00:48:25,263
Roger?
Hey, it's Jason.

765
00:48:25,302 --> 00:48:26,633
Ah, Jason.

766
00:48:26,670 --> 00:48:30,106
Jason, you know,
this really isn't a good time.

767
00:48:30,140 --> 00:48:32,335
Why, what's wrong?

768
00:48:32,376 --> 00:48:34,276
Oh...

769
00:48:34,311 --> 00:48:37,246
You know, I don't know.
I may be in prison

770
00:48:37,281 --> 00:48:39,249
inside of a month,

771
00:48:39,283 --> 00:48:41,183
and...

772
00:48:41,218 --> 00:48:42,845
oh, yeah,

773
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:45,719
my wife... she seems
to have left me.

774
00:48:45,756 --> 00:48:48,452
Whoa whoa.
Why? What happened?

775
00:48:48,492 --> 00:48:50,289
Hell, you know what?
Let's ask Ed.

776
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:52,295
He seems to have
his finger on the pulse

777
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:54,263
of just about
fucking everything.

778
00:48:54,298 --> 00:48:56,698
God damn it.

779
00:48:56,733 --> 00:48:59,031
I don't even know what to say.
Did she leave a note?

780
00:48:59,069 --> 00:49:01,060
Took the furniture.
Pretty big clue.

781
00:49:01,104 --> 00:49:02,537
Oh, shit.

782
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:04,665
Yeah, man, shit.

783
00:49:04,708 --> 00:49:06,471
You know, Ed was right.

784
00:49:06,510 --> 00:49:08,478
Hmm, Ed was fucking right,
you know?

785
00:49:08,512 --> 00:49:10,343
I should have
seen this coming.

786
00:49:10,380 --> 00:49:13,315
It was always about the money
and the lack of it.

787
00:49:13,350 --> 00:49:14,578
Fuck.

788
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,882
Oh, fuck.

789
00:49:16,920 --> 00:49:19,286
She took the big screen!

790
00:49:20,891 --> 00:49:22,552
So what are you
gonna do?

791
00:49:22,592 --> 00:49:25,561
I don't know, since this just happened
about five fucking minutes ago,

792
00:49:25,595 --> 00:49:28,063
I really have no idea.
Hey, maybe I'll burn the house down,

793
00:49:28,098 --> 00:49:30,828
since it usually
comes in threes.

794
00:49:31,902 --> 00:49:34,769
So, what good news
do you have?

795
00:49:34,805 --> 00:49:37,501
Shit, man...

796
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:40,135
I don't even want to
bring it up now,

797
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:42,577
but Ed wants us to come out
to the cabin Friday after work.

798
00:49:42,612 --> 00:49:44,807
You know, planning
and all that stuff.

799
00:49:44,848 --> 00:49:49,012
Of course he does.
Have to keep on a tight schedule.

800
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:50,986
Can you make it?

801
00:49:51,021 --> 00:49:52,682
Hold on.

802
00:49:53,857 --> 00:49:56,417
Let me ask my wife.

803
00:49:56,460 --> 00:49:59,156
Sherry honey?

804
00:49:59,196 --> 00:50:01,687
I have to go meet up
with the guys on Friday

805
00:50:01,732 --> 00:50:03,962
to talk about this robbery
we're planning

806
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,026
to get back
the money I lost

807
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:08,731
trying to keep you
from leaving me.

808
00:50:08,772 --> 00:50:10,967
Okay?

809
00:50:12,776 --> 00:50:16,177
Yeah yeah,
that shouldn't be a problem.

810
00:50:51,815 --> 00:50:53,578
Hey hey.

811
00:50:53,617 --> 00:50:55,084
Remember what
I told you:

812
00:50:55,118 --> 00:50:56,915
This guy is a pro.

813
00:50:56,953 --> 00:50:59,717
And if you have any second
thoughts about getting out,

814
00:50:59,756 --> 00:51:03,214
now's the time to do it.
Because once you're in, you're in.

815
00:51:03,260 --> 00:51:06,696
You can't get out of it
like a job offer.

816
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:10,191
One more thing:
the vig is

817
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:13,361
I get 10% of your in.

818
00:51:13,403 --> 00:51:14,665
'Course you do.

819
00:51:14,704 --> 00:51:15,966
Thank you.

820
00:51:32,789 --> 00:51:34,586
Here's Paul.

821
00:51:34,624 --> 00:51:35,989
Come on.

822
00:51:36,026 --> 00:51:38,517
I'm gonna take
a walk outside.

823
00:51:50,607 --> 00:51:52,598
You rolled Freddie Green,

824
00:51:52,642 --> 00:51:56,271
and all she did was
break your little digit.

825
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:00,706
Man, are you lucky.

826
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:03,651
She must really
like you, son.

827
00:52:05,055 --> 00:52:07,751
What do you want?

828
00:52:07,791 --> 00:52:11,249
Vinnie said I could get in
on a job with you.

829
00:52:11,294 --> 00:52:13,125
What else he say?

830
00:52:13,163 --> 00:52:16,690
He didn't know all the details.

831
00:52:18,101 --> 00:52:20,467
Do you want to know
all the details?

832
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:23,803
Yeah, I want to.

833
00:52:25,242 --> 00:52:28,177
Pretty simple, actually.

834
00:52:30,080 --> 00:52:32,640
If you want in,

835
00:52:32,682 --> 00:52:34,946
you're in.

836
00:52:34,985 --> 00:52:37,180
If you want out,

837
00:52:37,220 --> 00:52:38,778
that's the door.

838
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:42,491
And if you fuck up,

839
00:52:44,694 --> 00:52:47,060
then I will kill you.

840
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:48,928
Now,

841
00:52:48,965 --> 00:52:51,559
are you in or out?

842
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:53,432
I'm in.

843
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:58,803
I like that.

844
00:53:00,076 --> 00:53:01,509
I like that.

845
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:03,137
You are in.

846
00:53:04,748 --> 00:53:07,216
I like you.

847
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:08,717
- You've got a shot.
- Hi.

848
00:53:08,752 --> 00:53:10,481
I'm Todd,
I'm the wheel man.

849
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:12,818
Oh, sorry.

850
00:53:16,526 --> 00:53:18,653
Let's start again.

851
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:20,959
"I'm Todd."

852
00:53:20,997 --> 00:53:22,225
I'm Todd.

853
00:53:22,265 --> 00:53:25,166
"And I'm an asshole."

854
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:27,295
And I'm an asshole.

855
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:30,101
And you will not
speak again

856
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:32,700
until you are told
to speak.

857
00:53:33,910 --> 00:53:36,242
And I will not speak again
until I am told to speak.

858
00:53:36,279 --> 00:53:39,339
- "And this is because..."
- And this is because...

859
00:53:39,382 --> 00:53:41,282
"I don't come into
a room

860
00:53:41,318 --> 00:53:45,345
whenever I want to
and introduce myself to people

861
00:53:45,388 --> 00:53:48,221
as a wheel man
or anything else."

862
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:51,455
Is that what you do?
You walk into a fucking casino

863
00:53:51,494 --> 00:53:54,895
and you say, "Yeah,
wheel man on the end.

864
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:57,024
I fold at 16.

865
00:53:57,067 --> 00:53:59,228
I'm not gonna go
for 21.

866
00:53:59,269 --> 00:54:02,432
I fold at 16. I just wanted you to
know that's what I do."

867
00:54:02,472 --> 00:54:04,940
You're a fucking asshole.

868
00:54:32,769 --> 00:54:35,033
You know, this sucks.

869
00:54:37,974 --> 00:54:39,441
- Huh?
- I mean, Jesus Christ.

870
00:54:39,476 --> 00:54:40,966
I mean, look at us.

871
00:54:41,011 --> 00:54:43,809
We drove all the way up
to a cabin to practice for a robbery,

872
00:54:43,847 --> 00:54:46,407
when we should be fucking
playing golf, man.

873
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:49,612
Yeah, it's a little
over our heads.

874
00:54:49,653 --> 00:54:52,645
But, it is a way out, man.

875
00:54:52,689 --> 00:54:54,054
Yeah.

876
00:54:54,090 --> 00:54:55,648
Let's talk about that.

877
00:54:55,692 --> 00:54:57,683
Doesn't it seem
a little odd to you?

878
00:54:57,727 --> 00:55:00,093
- What?
- Ed.

879
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:02,621
Look, he... he got us
into this, and what?

880
00:55:02,666 --> 00:55:05,362
It takes him what, about a whole day
to figure out a way out?

881
00:55:05,402 --> 00:55:07,165
Isn't that just
a little too convenient?

882
00:55:07,203 --> 00:55:10,001
Huh? It's almost like he wanted this
investment to go south.

883
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,803
Yeah, but why?

884
00:55:11,841 --> 00:55:13,604
I don't know.

885
00:55:13,643 --> 00:55:16,203
Maybe to give himself
permission to do something

886
00:55:16,246 --> 00:55:18,714
exactly like this.

887
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:21,239
Come on, Roger, don't you think
you're reaching just a little bit?

888
00:55:21,284 --> 00:55:23,081
Maybe, but you
got to admit, man,

889
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:25,280
he's a little too much
into that army shit.

890
00:55:25,322 --> 00:55:28,519
It's like time stood still the day
he was fucking discharged.

891
