00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,033
- BECAUSE IT LOOKED LIKE
HE HAD WHITE KNEE SOCKS ON.

181
00:12:03,100 --> 00:12:04,566
BEAT YOU UP THE STAIRS!

182
00:12:18,433 --> 00:12:21,866
- BEN! BEN!

183
00:12:22,833 --> 00:12:24,367
BEN TAYLOR, GET OVER HERE!

184
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:26,899
- MORNING, DALLAS.
HOW ARE YOU?

185
00:12:26,966 --> 00:12:28,133
MELINDA?

186
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:29,666
- I'M SICK AND TIRED
OF YOU BABYING MELINDA.

187
00:12:29,733 --> 00:12:31,200
- "MORNING TO YOU, BEN.
HOW YOU DOING?"

188
00:12:31,266 --> 00:12:32,367
- JUST LOOK AT THIS RING.

189
00:12:32,433 --> 00:12:35,333
IT'S WAY TOO SOFT
FOR COMPETITION.

190
00:12:35,400 --> 00:12:37,599
- DALLAS, THAT TRACK RING
KEEPS THE FOOTING SAFE.

191
00:12:37,666 --> 00:12:39,433
HORSES DON'T GET HURT,
THE KIDS DON'T GET HURT.

192
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:42,599
- I'M PAYING YOU GOOD MONEY
TO TEACH MELINDA TO RACE,

193
00:12:42,666 --> 00:12:44,632
AND YOU'RE NOT WORTH
A PLUGGED NICKEL.

194
00:12:44,699 --> 00:12:46,266
- IT SEEMS LIKE THIS PLUGGED
NICKEL HAS DONE GOOD ENOUGH

195
00:12:46,333 --> 00:12:48,133
TO GET YOUR DAUGHTER TO
THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP.

196
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:50,233
YOU KNOW, DALLAS, YOU
GOT A REAL ATTITUDE.

197
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,966
- PERSONALLY, BEN, I'D
RATHER BE A WIDOW WITH

198
00:12:53,033 --> 00:12:55,666
AN ATTITUDE THAN A
BROKEN DOWN OLD COWBOY

199
00:12:55,733 --> 00:12:58,266
WITHOUT A DIME TO HIS NAME.

200
00:12:58,333 --> 00:13:00,166
MELINDA, SADDLE YOUR HORSE.

201
00:13:02,233 --> 00:13:04,833
- DALLAS, YOU STILL MAKE A
PAIR OF WRANGLERS LOOK BETTER

202
00:13:04,899 --> 00:13:07,133
THAN ANY WOMAN I EVER SAW.

203
00:13:11,599 --> 00:13:12,433
THEY LOVE IT.

204
00:13:12,500 --> 00:13:13,566
COME ON.

205
00:13:14,933 --> 00:13:17,233
- YOU LIKE GETTING YOUR
NOSE SCRATCHED, DON'T YOU.

206
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:19,400
YOU'RE SO PRETTY.

207
00:13:19,467 --> 00:13:20,467
YES.

208
00:13:20,532 --> 00:13:22,233
HI, I'M SUNNY AND
THIS IS GINGER.

209
00:13:22,300 --> 00:13:23,699
DO YOU RIDE HERE?

210
00:13:28,566 --> 00:13:30,966
GEE, I WONDER WHAT
HER PROBLEM WAS.

211
00:13:34,666 --> 00:13:36,666
- HEY LITTLE GIRL, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING IN THERE?

212
00:13:36,733 --> 00:13:37,899
- GINGER, STOP THAT.

213
00:13:37,966 --> 00:13:40,233
THAT'S NO WAY TO BEHAVE.

214
00:13:40,300 --> 00:13:42,866
- HEY, DIDN'T YOU HEAR WHAT
I TOLD YOU ABOUT

215
00:13:42,933 --> 00:13:44,200
CLIMBING INTO PADDOCKS?

216
00:13:44,266 --> 00:13:45,433
- YES, SIR, MR. BEN.

217
00:13:45,500 --> 00:13:47,200
YOU SAID NOT TO CLIMB
INTO PENS WITH HORSES

218
00:13:47,266 --> 00:13:50,367
I DON'T KNOW. I KNOW GINGER.

219
00:13:50,433 --> 00:13:52,632
WE ALREADY MADE FRIENDS.

220
00:13:58,599 --> 00:13:59,999
- WELL, I GUESS YOU HAVE.

221
00:14:00,066 --> 00:14:02,033
- CRAZIEST THING I EVER SAW.

222
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:03,066
I WOULDN'T BELIEVE IT
IF I DIDN'T SEE IT

223
00:14:03,133 --> 00:14:04,666
WITH MY OWN EYES.

224
00:14:04,733 --> 00:14:06,400
I STILL DON'T BELIEVE IT.

225
00:14:06,467 --> 00:14:08,500
- SUNNY, THIS HERE IS BUDDY.

226
00:14:08,566 --> 00:14:09,899
BUDDY WORKS WITH ME.

227
00:14:09,966 --> 00:14:11,966
- HOWDY.
- HI.

228
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:14,532
- SUNNY, I TELL YOU WHAT,
YOU RUN OVER TO THE TACK ROM,

229
00:14:14,599 --> 00:14:15,799
GRAB DOWN A BRUSH.

230
00:14:15,866 --> 00:14:18,266
I'LL BET WE CAN CONVINCE
BUDDY HERE TO GIVE YOU A

231
00:14:18,333 --> 00:14:20,699
LESSON IN BRUSHING
GINGER DOWN.

232
00:14:20,766 --> 00:14:22,799
- REALLY?
- YEP.

233
00:14:22,866 --> 00:14:24,532
- OH, YOU'D LIKE
THAT, WOULDN'T YOU.

234
00:14:24,599 --> 00:14:25,799
YES, YOU WOULD.

235
00:14:25,866 --> 00:14:27,833
STAY RIGHT HERE, OKAY?

236
00:14:27,899 --> 00:14:29,333
DON'T YOU GO ANYWHERE.

237
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:30,166
- HERE YOU GO.

238
00:14:30,233 --> 00:14:30,899
YEAH.

239
00:14:30,966 --> 00:14:32,100
RIGHT UNDERNEATH.

240
00:14:32,166 --> 00:14:33,866
RIGHT UP ON THE WALL
YOU'LL SEE THEM UP THERE.

241
00:14:33,933 --> 00:14:35,066
- OKAY.

242
00:14:38,400 --> 00:14:40,467
- I STILL DON'T BELIEVE IT.

243
00:14:44,033 --> 00:14:45,833
- WHO IS THAT GIRL
WITH THE CRUTCH?

244
00:14:45,899 --> 00:14:46,899
- I DON'T KNOW HER NAME,

245
00:14:46,966 --> 00:14:49,100
BUT I THINK SHE'S A
FRIEND OF BEN'S.

246
00:14:49,166 --> 00:14:51,066
- I'VE SEEN HER AROUND HERE.

247
00:14:51,133 --> 00:14:54,166
- WHAT'S SHE DOING WITH
THAT OLD CROW BAIT GINGER?

248
00:14:54,233 --> 00:14:56,300
- I DON'T KNOW. WHY?

249
00:14:56,367 --> 00:14:58,866
- BECAUSE I WANT
TO KNOW, THAT'S WHY.

250
00:14:58,933 --> 00:15:00,266
- OKAY.

251
00:15:14,400 --> 00:15:15,766
- READY FOR SWEET DREAMS?

252
00:15:15,833 --> 00:15:17,033
- UH-HUH.

253
00:15:17,599 --> 00:15:18,833
WHAT'S THAT?

254
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:20,066
- THIS IS A BOOK THAT I HAD
WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL

255
00:15:20,133 --> 00:15:22,266
ABOUT HORSES. WANT ME
TO READ YOU SOME?

256
00:15:22,333 --> 00:15:23,999
- SURE.

257
00:15:26,566 --> 00:15:27,266
MOMMY?

258
00:15:27,333 --> 00:15:28,467
- HUH.

259
00:15:28,532 --> 00:15:29,966
- DO YOU THINK THERE
ARE HORSES IN HEAVEN?

260
00:15:30,033 --> 00:15:31,999
- I WOULD THINK SO.

261
00:15:32,066 --> 00:15:34,699
- DO YOU THINK DADDY WOULD
HAVE A HORSE IN HEAVEN?

262
00:15:39,666 --> 00:15:42,333
- I THINK THAT DADDY
WOULD PROBABLY RATHER

263
00:15:42,400 --> 00:15:44,333
HAVE A SAIL BOAT.

264
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:50,999
LET'S SEE...

265
00:15:53,500 --> 00:15:55,866
- YOU LOVE TO GET YOUR
TUMMY BRUSHED, DON'T YOU?

266
00:15:55,933 --> 00:15:58,066
YOU'RE LOOKING SO PRETTY.

267
00:15:59,200 --> 00:16:01,766
- THEY'RE SELLING
THAT HORSE, YOU KNOW.

268
00:16:02,467 --> 00:16:03,632
- ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?

269
00:16:03,699 --> 00:16:05,200
- THE GUY'S HERE RIGHT NOW
WHO BUYS HORSES TO

270
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:07,467
CHOP THEM UP AND SELL
THEM FOR DOG FOOD.

271
00:16:07,532 --> 00:16:08,566
I HEARD HIM TALKING TO BEN,

272
00:16:08,632 --> 00:16:10,966
AND THAT'S THE HORSE
HE'S HERE TO GET.

273
00:16:11,033 --> 00:16:12,666
- YOU'RE A LIAR!

274
00:16:12,733 --> 00:16:13,799
- WHATEVER.

275
00:16:14,532 --> 00:16:15,566
- DON'T WORRY, GINGER,

276
00:16:15,632 --> 00:16:17,766
I'M NOT GONNA LET
ANYBODY HURT YOU.

277
00:16:24,200 --> 00:16:25,100
- SUNNY, GO ON.

278
00:16:25,166 --> 00:16:26,200
CLEAR OUT OF HERE
FOR A MINUTE.

279
00:16:26,266 --> 00:16:27,966
GO AHEAD.

280
00:16:29,400 --> 00:16:31,400
- SO, THIS IS THE MAN KILLER

281
00:16:31,467 --> 00:16:33,733
I'VE HEARD SO
MUCH ABOUT, HUH?

282
00:16:35,133 --> 00:16:36,699
- HE SURE DON'T LIKE
ME, THAT'S FOR SURE.

283
00:16:37,899 --> 00:16:40,367
- I DON'T KNOW, BEN.
SHE'S PRETTY SKINNY.

284
00:16:40,433 --> 00:16:43,266
I'LL GIVE YOU $400
DOLLARS FOR HER.

285
00:16:43,333 --> 00:16:45,833
- BEN, I'D TAKE IT AND RUN.

286
00:16:47,433 --> 00:16:50,500
- SUNNY, SUNNY, WE'RE
DOING BUSINESS HERE.

287
00:16:50,566 --> 00:16:52,233
WHAT IS IT?

288
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,467
- I'LL BUY HER.

289
00:16:54,532 --> 00:16:58,467
- YOU'LL WHAT?

290
00:16:59,166 --> 00:17:01,066
- I'LL BUY GINGER.

291
00:17:04,233 --> 00:17:05,933

293
00:17:09,200 --> 00:17:11,333
- UH-HUH. $4 DOLLARS.

294
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,467
SUNNY, WHY SHOULD I GO

295
00:17:13,532 --> 00:17:14,799
FOR $4 DOLLARS.

296
00:17:14,866 --> 00:17:17,866
THIS MAN HERE IS
GONNA GIVE ME $400.

297
00:17:22,766 --> 00:17:24,799
- BECAUSE I LOVE HER.

298
00:17:34,500 --> 00:17:37,799
- BEN, COME ON. YOU
WANT THE $400 OR NOT?

299
00:17:41,666 --> 00:17:45,866
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,
YOU GO ON AND GET HER.

300
00:17:45,933 --> 00:17:47,966
SHE'S YOURS.

301
00:17:53,233 --> 00:17:55,467
- WOE, STEADY GIRL.

302
00:17:56,733 --> 00:17:57,833
STEADY... STEADY...

303
00:17:57,899 --> 00:17:59,000
WOE!

304
00:17:59,066 --> 00:18:00,367
WOE!

305
00:18:01,133 --> 00:18:03,300
- EASY. EASY, GINGER.

306
00:18:03,367 --> 00:18:04,566
- HERE, THAT HORSE
IS A KILLER, BEN!

307
00:18:04,632 --> 00:18:06,066
YOU OUGHT TO HAVE
HER PUT DOWN!

308
00:18:07,400 --> 00:18:13,467
- SUNNY. YOU LEAD HER OUT
OF THERE, SHE'S YOURS.

309
00:18:16,333 --> 00:18:17,233
- ARE YOU CRAZY?

310
00:18:17,300 --> 00:18:19,532
- LET HER GO. LET HER GO.

311
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:20,833
- HE'LL KILL HER.

312
00:18:22,033 --> 00:18:23,500
- THAT'S IT, SUNNY.

313
00:18:23,566 --> 00:18:25,166
WOE, WOE.

314
00:18:25,233 --> 00:18:27,166
AIN'T NO DEAL UNTIL
I GET MY MONEY.

315
00:18:34,066 --> 00:18:35,799
SHE'S YOURS.

316
00:18:36,333 --> 00:18:38,166
GO ON.

317
00:18:42,999 --> 00:18:45,899
- I WAS GONNA GO TO $500.

318
00:18:45,966 --> 00:18:48,467
NO WONDER I'M
BROKE ALL THE TIME.

319
00:18:51,699 --> 00:18:53,699
- YOU HAD TO DO IT, HUH?

320
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:55,666
- BUDDY, I COULDN'T
HELP MYSELF.

321
00:18:55,733 --> 00:18:57,166
- AWE!

322
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:04,266
- SHERRY, DID I
DO THE RIGHT THING?

323
00:19:07,066 --> 00:19:09,066
YOU'RE DARN RIGHT, I DID.

324
00:19:26,300 --> 00:19:28,766
- MOM, MOM, GUESS WHAT?
I BOUGHT GINGER!

325
00:19:28,833 --> 00:19:30,133
- YOU BOUGHT WHO?
- GINGER!

326
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:31,500
BEN WAS GOING TO SELL
HER FOR DOG FOOD,

327
00:19:31,566 --> 00:19:33,433
BUT I SAID I'D BUY
HER AND BEN SAID OKAY.

328
00:19:33,500 --> 00:19:34,566
- WAIT A MINUTE. YOU'RE
NOT MAKING ANY SENSE.

329
00:19:34,632 --> 00:19:35,599
WHO IS BEN?

330
00:19:35,666 --> 00:19:37,666
- THE COWBOY
WHO OWNS GINGER.

331
00:19:37,733 --> 00:19:39,467
- WHAT DOES HE HAVE
TO DO WITH DOG FOOD?

332
00:19:39,532 --> 00:19:40,699
DID YOU BUY A DOG?

333
00:19:40,766 --> 00:19:42,400
- NO, NO, A HORSE!
YOU'VE GOTTA SEE HER.

334
00:19:42,467 --> 00:19:43,500
COME ON! COME ON!

335
00:19:43,566 --> 00:19:44,899
- A HORSE?
- COME ON!

336
00:19:44,966 --> 00:19:46,532
- YOU BOUGHT A HORSE?

337
00:19:54,933 --> 00:19:58,400
- COME ON, MOM.
THIS IS GINGER.

338
00:19:58,467 --> 00:20:00,033
HI, GINGER.

339
00:20:01,666 --> 00:20:03,632
- HEY THERE. YOU MUST
BE SUNNY'S MOTHER.

340
00:20:03,699 --> 00:20:04,699
- BEN?

341
00:20:04,766 --> 00:20:07,233
- YEAH, BEN. BEN TAYLOR.

342
00:20:08,599 --> 00:20:10,833
- UM, THERE MUST BE SOME
KIND OF MISUNDERSTANDING.

343
00:20:10,899 --> 00:20:13,533
SUNNY SAYS YOU SOLD
HER THAT HORSE.

344
00:20:13,599 --> 00:20:16,066
- THAT'S ABOUT
THE SIZE OF IT.

345
00:20:16,133 --> 00:20:17,367
- SHE'S A LITTLE GIRL.

346
00:20:17,433 --> 00:20:19,367
YOU CAN'T SELL HER A HORSE
WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.

347
00:20:19,433 --> 00:20:20,766
- THAT'S A FACT.

348
00:20:20,833 --> 00:20:25,467
BUT YOU SEE, THERE WAS SOME
EXTENUATING CIRCUMSTANCES.

349
00:20:25,533 --> 00:20:26,999
- REALLY? SUCH AS?

350
00:20:27,066 --> 00:20:29,266
- WELL...

351
00:20:29,333 --> 00:20:31,467
[GIGGLING]

352
00:20:31,533 --> 00:20:34,632
YOU'RE A SWEETIE.

353
00:20:34,699 --> 00:20:35,833
YOU'RE FUNNY.

354
00:20:37,033 --> 00:20:38,467
- LOOK, THAT'S ALL
WELL AS GOOD, MISTER,

355
00:20:38,533 --> 00:20:40,200
BUT THE TRUTH IS I CAN'T
AFFORD TO FEED

356
00:20:40,266 --> 00:20:41,766
AND CARE FOR A HORSE.

357
00:20:41,833 --> 00:20:43,533
- SUNNY CAN DO A LITTLE WORK
FOR ME PART-TIME TO

358
00:20:43,599 --> 00:20:45,166
PAY FOR GINGER'S CARE.

359
00:20:45,233 --> 00:20:46,599
I THINK IT MIGHT
BE GOOD FOR HER.

360
00:20:46,666 --> 00:20:48,133
- CAN'T YOU SEE
SHE'S BEEN HURT?

361
00:20:48,200 --> 00:20:51,133
- I'M NO DOCTOR,
BUT LOOK AT THEM.

362
00:20:51,200 --> 00:20:54,367
IT KIND OF LOOKS LIKE
GOOD MEDICINE TO ME.

363
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:57,966
[GIGGLING]

364
00:20:58,033 --> 00:20:59,367
- YOU'RE RIGHT.
YOU'RE NO DOCTOR.

365
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:02,033
COME ON, SUNNY.
WE'RE GOING HOME.

366
00:21:02,100 --> 00:21:02,899
- COME ON, MOM!

367
00:21:02,966 --> 00:21:04,166
- SUNNY, WE'RE GOING HOME.

368
00:21:04,233 --> 00:21:05,467
COME ON, GET YOUR CRUTCH.

369
00:21:05,533 --> 00:21:07,100
- I JUST WANTED TO STAY
A LITTLE BIT LONGER.

370
00:21:07,166 --> 00:21:08,400
- LET'S GO.

371
00:21:08,467 --> 00:21:09,966
- BYE BYE, GINGER.

372
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:19,133
- YOU'RE CUTTING TOO
TIGHT IN THE TURN.

373
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:21,899
SWEETHEART, PAY ATTENTION!

374
00:21:24,966 --> 00:21:27,266
YOU'RE CUTTING TOO TIGHT.

375
00:21:29,666 --> 00:21:32,799
COME ON, MELINDA,
CONCENTRATE!

376
00:21:33,400 --> 00:21:35,033
COME ON!

377
00:21:36,333 --> 00:21:38,966
OH, NO!

378
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:45,367
- MELINDA, COME ON OVER.

379
00:21:46,666 --> 00:21:48,367
WE CUT THOSE A
LITTLE CLOSE, DID WE?

380
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:50,866
TAKE YOUR BOOT OUT
OF THE STIRRUP.

381
00:21:51,599 --> 00:21:52,666
DID YOU ADJUST THESE?

382
00:21:52,733 --> 00:21:54,933
- DALLAS DID. SAID
THEY WERE TOO SHORT.

383
00:21:54,999 --> 00:21:57,333
- UH-HUH. EVERYBODY'S
AN EXPERT.

384
00:21:57,400 --> 00:21:59,200
THAT'S WHY YOU
LOST A STIRRUP.

385
00:21:59,266 --> 00:22:02,266
GOOD NEWS. THAT RUN
WAS AN 18 FLAT.

386
00:22:02,333 --> 00:22:03,899
- BUT I KNOCKED
DOWN ALL THE BARRELS.

387
00:22:03,966 --> 00:22:06,966
- THAT'S WHY WE'RE
GONNA TRY AGAIN, HUH?

388
00:22:07,033 --> 00:22:08,899
HERE YOU GO.

389
00:22:09,400 --> 00:22:10,966
ALL SET?

390
00:22:11,033 --> 00:22:11,699
- YEP.

391
00:22:11,766 --> 00:22:15,632
- RIDE AWAY. HERE WE GO.

392
00:22:15,699 --> 00:22:17,467
READY?

393
00:22:18,766 --> 00:22:19,899
GO AHEAD!

GOOD!

397
00:22:29,966 --> 00:22:31,100
GOOD MELINDA.

398
00:22:31,166 --> 00:22:32,400
COME ON.

399
00:22:32,467 --> 00:22:34,999
KICK THE BARREL.

400
00:22:35,066 --> 00:22:36,899
NOW KICK IT. KICK IT.

401
00:22:36,966 --> 00:22:38,500
BRING IT ON. HERE WE GO.

THERE YOU GO!

403
00:22:39,766 --> 00:22:40,866
- YES!

404
00:22:40,933 --> 00:22:44,699
- ALL RIGHT, MELINDA,
THAT ONE WAS 15.9.

405
00:22:44,766 --> 00:22:46,033
- YES!

406
00:22:46,100 --> 00:22:48,566
- I DID IT! I BROKE 17!

407
00:22:48,632 --> 00:22:49,632
I WANNA RIDE AGAIN.

00:22:49,699 --> 00:22:51,400
- ALL RIGHT. YOU GOT IT.

409
00:22:51,467 --> 00:22:53,367
YOU'VE GOT IT.

410
00:22:53,966 --> 00:22:54,799
HEAD OVER.

411
00:22:55,766 --> 00:22:56,866
- 'CAUSE GINGER'S
HURT LIKE ME,

412
00:22:56,933 --> 00:22:58,733
I COULDN'T EVEN RIDE
HER IF I WANTED TO.

413
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:00,333
- THAT IS NOT THE POINT.

414
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:02,100
WHAT IF YOU GET
KICKED OR STEPPED ON?

415
00:23:02,166 --> 00:23:05,500
- GINGER WOULDN'T DO THAT.
SHE LOVES ME.

416
00:23:06,533 --> 00:23:07,766
YOU'RE NOT FAIR.

417
00:23:07,833 --> 00:23:10,333
YOU HAD A HORSE WHEN
YOU WERE MY AGE.

418
00:23:10,400 --> 00:23:12,833
- THAT WAS DIFFERENT.
I WASN'T INJURED.

419
00:23:13,866 --> 00:23:16,333
- I WISH DADDY WERE ALIVE.

420
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:18,733
HE'D LET ME HAVE GINGER.

421
00:23:26,233 --> 00:23:29,467
- SUNNY, DADDY WOULDN'T
LET YOU HAVE ANYTHING

422
00:23:29,533 --> 00:23:31,033
THAT WAS BAD FOR YOU.

423
00:23:31,100 --> 00:23:33,833
- GINGER'S NOT BAD FOR ME!

424
00:23:34,766 --> 00:23:37,367
SHE'S MY ONLY REAL FRIEND.

425
00:23:42,066 --> 00:23:44,433
- DO YOU THINK DR.
OLSON IS A SMART MAN?

426
00:23:44,500 --> 00:23:45,833
- I GUESS.

427
00:23:45,899 --> 00:23:48,367
- OKAY. I WILL MAKE
A DEAL WITH YOU.

428
00:23:48,433 --> 00:23:50,666
IF DR. OLSON SAYS THAT
IT'S OKAY FOR YOU TO BE

00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:53,766
AROUND GINGER, THEN
YOU CAN HAVE HER.

- YOU PROMISE?

431
00:24:01,866 --> 00:24:03,233
- I PROMISE.

432
00:24:11,333 --> 00:24:12,933
- MORNING, LADY.

433
00:24:12,999 --> 00:24:16,300
- DUTCH JOHN, YOU LOOK
MIGHTY FINE IN THIS NEW CAR.

434
00:24:16,367 --> 00:24:17,367
- THAT OLD THING?

435
00:24:17,433 --> 00:24:19,200
NOTHING BUT A
HORSE WITH WHEELS.

436
00:24:19,266 --> 00:24:21,966
- MELINDA, SAY HI
TO MR. HATHAWAY.

437
00:24:22,033 --> 00:24:23,333
- HI, MR. HATHAWAY.

438
00:24:23,400 --> 00:24:27,866
- GIRL, YOU'RE GROWING FASTER
THAN A WEED ON A CAL PINE

439
00:24:27,933 --> 00:24:30,367
AND YOU'RE JUST AS
PRETTY AS YOUR MOM.

440
00:24:30,433 --> 00:24:32,033
- LET'S GO INSIDE. WE'VE
GOT A LOT TO TALK ABOUT.

441
00:24:37,933 --> 00:24:39,699
- WELL, I TALKED TO MY
COMPANY ABOUT

442
00:24:39,766 --> 00:24:41,133
SPONSORING MELINDA.

443
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,566
HEAD HONCHO LIKES THE IDEA
BUT THERE'S A LITTLE WRINKLE.

444
00:24:44,632 --> 00:24:46,799
- WRINKLE? WHAT'S THAT?

445
00:24:46,866 --> 00:24:48,467
- IT'S NOT GONNA
HAPPEN THIS YEAR.

446
00:24:48,533 --> 00:24:51,166
MELINDA DID REAL GOOD LAST
YEAR ON THE REGIONALS,

447
00:24:51,233 --> 00:24:54,400
BUT TO SPONSOR HER, SHE'S
GONNA HAVE TO WIN

448
00:24:54,467 --> 00:24:55,799
THE STATE CHAMPIONSHIP.

449
00:24:55,866 --> 00:24:58,100
- THAT'S A LOT TO ASK
OF A TWELVE YEAR OLD.

450
00:24:58,166 --> 00:25:01,300
- FULL RIDE COLLEGE
SCHOLARSHIP, ALL EXPENSES,

452

OH, AND I FORGOT TO MENTION
$100,000 DOLLARS CASH.

[WHISTLING]

454
00:25:11,166 --> 00:25:13,866
TO WIN, SHE NEEDS
A NEW HORSE, JOHN.

455
00:25:13,933 --> 00:25:16,266
NOT THAT BROKEN DOWN BAG
OF BONES BEN'S GOT HER ON.

456
00:25:16,333 --> 00:25:18,766
- IF I WERE YOU, DALLAS,
I'D LISTEN TO BEN.

457
00:25:18,833 --> 00:25:21,833
IF HE'S GOT HER RIDING A NAG,
HE'S GOT REASONS FOR IT.

458
00:25:21,899 --> 00:25:26,833
- FORGET BEN. WHAT ABOUT
A NEW HORSE, JOHN?

459
00:25:28,632 --> 00:25:32,033
- OKAY. NAME'S STEEL.

460
00:25:32,100 --> 00:25:33,533
JOHNNY DOBSON'S SELLING HIM.

461
00:25:33,599 --> 00:25:34,533
BUT HE'S EXPENSIVE.

462
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:35,799
- HOW EXPENSIVE?

463
00:25:35,866 --> 00:25:37,733
- VERY.

464
00:25:41,766 --> 00:25:43,333
- I CAN HANDLE THAT.

465
00:25:45,500 --> 00:25:46,766
- BEN NAMED HER GINGER
BECAUSE SHE'S THE

466
00:25:46,833 --> 00:25:48,133
SAME COLOR AS GINGERBREAD.

467
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:49,766
HE SOLD HER TO ME
FOR $4 DOLLARS.

468
00:25:49,833 --> 00:25:52,733
SHE GOT BANGED UP IN A RODEO,
AND SHE LIMPS JUST LIKE ME.

469
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:54,666
- AND I DON'T THINK THAT A
GROWN MAN SHOULD BE SELLING A

470
00:25:54,733 --> 00:25:57,033
LITTLE GIRL A HORSE AND AN
INJURED LITTLE GIRL AT THAT.

471
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,933
AND HE DIDN'T EVEN
ASK ME MY PERMISSION.

472
00:25:58,999 --> 00:26:00,266
- WAIT, WAIT,
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.

473
00:26:00,333 --> 00:26:03,733
TIME OUT, EVERYONE. TAKE
A DEEP BREATH, HUH?

474
00:26:03,799 --> 00:26:05,699
SUNNY, WHY DON'T YOU
HOP UP ON THE TABLE NOW.

475
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:10,033
WELL, THAT WAS VERY GOOD.

476
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:13,533
- MY MOM SAID IF
YOU SAID IT WAS OKAY,

477
00:26:13,599 --> 00:26:15,300
I COULD KEEP GINGER.

478
00:26:15,367 --> 00:26:18,133
- ALL RIGHT, SO SUPPOSE YOU
TELL ME WHAT'S GOING ON.

479
00:26:18,200 --> 00:26:20,632
- WELL, SHE HAS BEEN HANGING
OUT AT THIS GUY'S STABLE,

480
00:26:20,699 --> 00:26:22,866
THIS BEN CHARACTER.

481
00:26:22,933 --> 00:26:24,533
AND HE SOLD HER
THIS CRIPPLED HORSE.

482
00:26:24,599 --> 00:26:25,966
- GINGER.

483
00:26:26,033 --> 00:26:27,333
- GINGER. FOR $4 DOLLARS.

484
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:28,766
I JUST DON'T THINK IT'S
A GOOD IDEA FOR HER

485
00:26:28,833 --> 00:26:30,000
TO BE AROUND HORSES.

486
00:26:30,066 --> 00:26:32,599
BUT I PROMISED HER THAT
I WOULD TALK TO YOU

487
00:26:32,666 --> 00:26:34,066
BEFORE I MADE MY DECISION.

488
00:26:34,133 --> 00:26:37,200
- OH, SO I CAN BE
THE BAD GUY, HUH?

489
00:26:37,266 --> 00:26:38,933
I GET THE PICTURE.

490
00:26:39,000 --> 00:26:40,733
YOUR MAIN CONCERN IS
THAT SUNNY DOESN'T

491
00:26:40,799 --> 00:26:42,467
RE-INJURE HER LEG, HUH?

492
00:26:42,533 --> 00:26:44,100
- YEAH. THAT'S
PRETTY MUCH IT.

493
00:26:44,166 --> 00:26:47,200
- WELL, IT'S TRUE THERE
CERTAINLY IS SOME RISK

494
00:26:47,266 --> 00:26:49,533
INVOLVED IN OWNING A HORSE.

495
00:26:49,599 --> 00:26:51,266
BUT THAT HAS TO BE WEIGHED
AGAINST THE POSSIBLE

496
00:26:51,333 --> 00:26:53,500
GOOD IT CAN DO.

497
00:26:53,566 --> 00:26:55,266
SO SUNNY, HOW IS
YOUR LEG DOING?

498
00:26:55,333 --> 00:26:56,300
- BETTER.

499
00:26:56,367 --> 00:26:57,666
- UH-HUH, HOW BETTER?

500
00:26:57,733 --> 00:26:59,666
- I DON'T LIMP AS BAD.

501
00:26:59,733 --> 00:27:01,632
AND IT DOESN'T
HURT LIKE BEFORE.

502
00:27:01,699 --> 00:27:04,166
- WELL YOU CERTAINLY SEEM TO
BE DOING A LOT BETTER THAN

503
00:27:04,233 --> 00:27:06,799
THE LAST TIME I SAW YOU,
WOULDN'T YOU AGREE?

504
00:27:07,799 --> 00:27:09,367
- YES, I WOULD
HAVE TO AGREE.

505
00:27:10,632 --> 00:27:11,999
- SUNNY, ARE YOU GONNA
BE RIDING THIS HORSE?

506
00:27:12,066 --> 00:27:14,433
- NO. I JUST WALK HER.

507
00:27:14,500 --> 00:27:17,133
BEN SAID NOBODY CAN RIDE
HER BECAUSE OF HER LEG.

508
00:27:18,467 --> 00:27:19,367
- DR. OLSON?

509
00:27:19,433 --> 00:27:21,066
- YES, DR. UPCHURCH?

510
00:27:21,133 --> 00:27:23,233
- I'VE CHECKED X-RAYS AND
I HAVE THEM IN MY OFFICE

511
00:27:23,300 --> 00:27:25,033
WHEN YOU CARE TO COME
IN TO DISCUSS THEM.

512
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:27,100
- ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU.
I'LL BE RIGHT IN.

513
00:27:28,367 --> 00:27:30,933
WELL, MEDICALLY
SPEAKING, MRS. MATHEWS,

514
00:27:30,999 --> 00:27:34,367
THERE'S REALLY NO REASON WHY
SUNNY SHOULDN'T HAVE GINGER.

515
00:27:34,433 --> 00:27:36,833
- OH, PLEASE, MOM?
YOU PROMISED.

516
00:27:37,666 --> 00:27:38,999
- OH, BOY.

517
00:27:39,933 --> 00:27:40,467
- PLEASE?

518
00:27:41,866 --> 00:27:44,333
- WELL, THIS IS AGAINST MY
BETTER JUDGMENT BUT, OKAY.

519
00:27:44,400 --> 00:27:46,133
A PROMISE IS A PROMISE.

520
00:27:46,200 --> 00:27:47,333
- THANK YOU! THANK YOU!
THANK YOU!

521
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,799
THANK YOU! THANK YOU!

522
00:27:54,866 --> 00:27:57,599
- HEY, STABLE GIRL, YOU
STILL WASTING YOUR TIME

523
00:27:57,666 --> 00:27:59,433
ON THAT OLD CROW BAIT?

524
00:27:59,500 --> 00:28:01,733
I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU THE ONLY
THING SHE'D BE GOOD FOR IS

525
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:05,733
GLUE. HEY, MAYBE YOU CAN
GET HER A WOODEN LEG.

526
00:28:05,799 --> 00:28:08,367
I HEAR THEY GOT THEM
REAL CHEAP AT SEARS.

527
00:28:08,433 --> 00:28:10,699
- DON'T YOU GIRLS HAVE
SOMEPLACE TO BE GETTING TO?

528
00:28:10,766 --> 00:28:13,566
GO ON.

529
00:28:16,899 --> 00:28:19,699
WHAT IS IT? WHY YOU CRYING?

530
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:22,733
- THOSE GIRLS SAID TERRIBLE
THINGS ABOUT GINGER.

531
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:24,632
- YOU BELIEVE IT?

532
00:28:26,333 --> 00:28:28,799
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING, IF
YOU'RE GONNA BE A COWGIRL,

533
00:28:28,866 --> 00:28:30,533
YOU GOT TO BE TOUGH.

534
00:28:30,599 --> 00:28:32,899
YOU CAN'T LET MEAN PEOPLE
HURT YOUR FEELINGS.

535
00:28:32,966 --> 00:28:35,300
BELIEVE ME, I KNOW.

536
00:28:35,367 --> 00:28:36,933
- IS BEN A REAL COWBOY?

537
00:28:36,999 --> 00:28:38,533
- YOU BET.

538
00:28:38,599 --> 00:28:40,899
BEN AND ME, WE RODE THE
RODEO CIRCUIT TOGETHER

539
00:28:40,966 --> 00:28:42,566
FOR A LOT OF YEARS.

540
00:28:43,500 --> 00:28:45,966
- BUDDY, CAN
GINGER GET WELL?

541
00:28:46,033 --> 00:28:49,033
- I DON'T KNOW. VET
SAYS SHE'S CRIPPLED.

542
00:28:49,100 --> 00:28:51,367
- MAYBE HE WAS WRONG.

543
00:28:51,433 --> 00:28:53,666
- COULD BE. BEN AND ME,

544
00:28:53,733 --> 00:28:56,766
WE'LL LOOK INTO IT A
LITTLE MORE FOR YOU, OKAY?

545
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:58,400
- THANK YOU!

546
00:28:59,533 --> 00:29:00,899
- OKAY, HONEY.

547
00:29:04,300 --> 00:29:05,966
- I DON'T KNOW, MR. TAYLOR.

548
00:29:06,033 --> 00:29:08,933
THE DAMAGE TO THE
ANKLE IS EXTENSIVE.

549
00:29:08,999 --> 00:29:10,733
THE NERVE ISN'T DAMAGED,
THAT'S FOR SURE.

550
00:29:10,799 --> 00:29:12,400
SHE CAN FEEL THIS INJURY.

551
00:29:12,467 --> 00:29:13,333
WOE.

552
00:29:13,400 --> 00:29:14,533
- EASY.

553
00:29:14,599 --> 00:29:15,799
- I'LL DO MY BEST TO
MAKE FRIENDS WITH GINGER.

554
00:29:15,866 --> 00:29:18,433
- DON'T WORRY, MOM. SHE'LL
LOVE YOU JUST FINE.

555
00:29:18,500 --> 00:29:19,533
WHAT ARE THEY DOING, MOM?

556
00:29:19,599 --> 00:29:20,566
- I DON'T KNOW.

557
00:29:20,632 --> 00:29:21,400
- THANKS A LOT, DOC.

558
00:29:22,733 --> 00:29:24,899
- I HEARD ABOUT A FELLOW
WITH A HORSE HOSPITAL WHO'S

559
00:29:24,966 --> 00:29:28,467
BEEN DOING SOME EXPERIMENTAL
SURGERY ON CRIPPLED HORSES.

560
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,333
DO YOU KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT HIM, DOC?

561
00:29:30,400 --> 00:29:32,166
- YOU MUST BE TALKING
ABOUT DALE JANSSEN.

562
00:29:32,233 --> 00:29:33,333
- THAT'S THE FELLOW.

563
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:35,367
- HE'S HAD SOME SUCCESS
WITH SOME NEW TECHNIQUES

564
00:29:35,433 --> 00:29:37,066
BUT HE'S EXPENSIVE.

565
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:38,666
HE COULD RUN YOU
AS HIGH AS 10,000

566
00:29:38,733 --> 00:29:41,166
AND IT STILL
AIN'T FOR SURE.

567
00:29:41,233 --> 00:29:44,100
- DOC, I'M GLAD YOU STOPPED
BY. APPRECIATE IT.

568
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:45,632
- SURE.

569
00:29:46,632 --> 00:29:48,100
- HOW MUCH IS
$10,000 DOLLARS?

570
00:29:48,166 --> 00:29:49,866
- A LOT. IT'S ENOUGH
TO BUY A CAR.

571
00:29:49,933 --> 00:29:51,333
- DO WE HAVE
$10,000 DOLLARS?

572
00:29:51,400 --> 00:29:53,467
- NO. I'M AFRAID WE
DON'T EVEN HAVE ONE.

573
00:29:53,533 --> 00:29:54,966
- HOWDY.

574
00:29:55,799 --> 00:29:57,266
- GINGER, THIS IS MY MOM.

575
00:29:57,333 --> 00:29:59,566
- HI, GINGER. WHAT
A NICE HORSE.

576
00:29:59,632 --> 00:30:01,166
- GINGER'S THE BEST.

577
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:02,233
IF SHE DIDN'T
HAVE THAT BAD LEG,

578
00:30:02,300 --> 00:30:03,467
SHE'D BE WORTH 50 GRAND.

579
00:30:03,533 --> 00:30:04,733
- YEAH, A LOT
MORE THAN THAT.

580
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:05,933
- WOW!

581
00:30:05,999 --> 00:30:07,033
- I'LL TALK TO THE DOC
JANSSEN AND SEE WHAT

582
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:08,133
HE HAS TO SAY.

583
00:30:08,200 --> 00:30:09,833
MAYBE HE CAN CUT
US A DISCOUNT.

584
00:30:09,899 --> 00:30:11,133
- I DON'T WANT YOU
TO GO TO ANY TROUBLE.

585
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,666
- NO TROUBLE TO ASK
A QUESTION OR TWO.

586
00:30:13,733 --> 00:30:15,133
LET'S GET HER PUT BACK.

587
00:30:20,066 --> 00:30:22,266
- THAT STEEL IS
A POWERFUL HORSE.

588
00:30:22,333 --> 00:30:23,666
THINK MELINDA CAN CANDLE HIM?

589
00:30:23,733 --> 00:30:26,866
- I TOLD MELINDA THAT I
DIDN'T SPEND $30,000 DOLLARS

590
00:30:26,933 --> 00:30:30,599
AND RISK LOSING THIS PLACE
TO HAVE HER HOLD BACK.

591
00:30:30,666 --> 00:30:31,999
SHE'LL DO IT.

592
00:30:32,733 --> 00:30:33,966
- WE'LL SEE.

593
00:30:37,699 --> 00:30:39,799
- COME ON, SUNNY.
GIVE ME THREE MORE.

594
00:30:39,866 --> 00:30:41,100
JUST THREE MORE AND
WE'RE DONE FOR THE DAY.

595
00:30:42,599 --> 00:30:45,133
- DOCTOR, I'VE BEEN ON THIS
THING FOR 20 MINUTES ALREADY.

596
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,033
- GO AHEAD AND
GET OFF, ALEXANDRA.

597
00:30:47,100 --> 00:30:48,233
- THANKS, DOCTOR.
SEE YOU TOMORROW.

598
00:30:48,300 --> 00:30:49,400
- BYE BYE. GOOD JOB.

599
00:30:50,033 --> 00:30:50,966
- I CAN'T.

600
00:30:51,033 --> 00:30:52,200
- COME ON, YOU
JUST DID, SUNNY.

601
00:30:52,266 --> 00:30:53,799
TWO MORE.

602
00:30:53,866 --> 00:30:55,066
- BUT IT HURTS.

603
00:30:55,133 --> 00:30:57,666
- I KNOW. KEEP GOING.

604
00:30:57,733 --> 00:30:58,899
LAST ONE.

605
00:30:58,966 --> 00:31:00,966
LAST ONE, SUNNY.

606
00:31:01,833 --> 00:31:04,733
YES! GOOD JOB! YES.

607
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,200
NOW THAT'S HOW HARD YOU
HAVE TO WORK EVERY TIME

608
00:31:07,266 --> 00:31:09,666
IF YOU WANT TO GET THAT
LEG BETTER, OKAY?

609
00:31:11,100 --> 00:31:13,367
- JESSE?
- YES?

610
00:31:13,433 --> 00:31:16,467
- COULD THERAPY HELP
A HORSE WITH A BAD LEG?

611
00:31:17,599 --> 00:31:19,233
- I DON'T KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT HORSES,

612
00:31:19,300 --> 00:31:21,200
BUT IF THERE'S
NO BONES BROKEN,

613
00:31:21,266 --> 00:31:23,100
I DON'T SEE HOW IT CAN HURT.

614
00:31:23,699 --> 00:31:24,999
- THANK YOU.

615
00:31:34,166 --> 00:31:36,200
- YOU SEE, I TOLD YOU IT
WOULD BE GOOD FOR YOU TO GET

616
00:31:36,266 --> 00:31:37,999
OUT OF THE HOUSE FOR A WHILE.

617
00:31:38,066 --> 00:31:40,766
- I'M STILL NOT SURE
I'M VERY GOOD COMPANY.

618
00:31:40,833 --> 00:31:43,500
- YOU'RE THE BEST COMPANY
I'VE HAD IN A LONG TIME.

619
00:31:43,566 --> 00:31:45,599
- OH, PLEASE. A
MAN LIKE YOU?

620
00:31:45,666 --> 00:31:48,500
A HANDSOME SUCCESSFUL
DOCTOR MUST HAVE WOMEN

621
00:31:48,566 --> 00:31:50,367
CHASING AFTER HIM.

622
00:31:50,433 --> 00:31:54,333
- KATHLEEN, THERE ARE SO
MANY GOLD DIGGERS OUT THERE.

623
00:31:54,400 --> 00:31:56,166
I DON'T EVEN TELL A
WOMAN WHAT I DO UNTIL A

624
00:31:56,233 --> 00:31:58,000
SECOND OR THIRD DATE.

625
00:31:59,066 --> 00:32:01,266
- WELL, YOUR SECRET
IS SAFE WITH ME.

626
00:32:05,166 --> 00:32:06,899
I HATE TO BRING THIS UP
DURING DINNER BUT HOW DO YOU

627
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:08,632
THINK SUNNY IS DOING?

628
00:32:08,699 --> 00:32:10,699
- WELL FOR A WHILE,
TO BE QUITE HONEST,

629
00:32:10,766 --> 00:32:14,133
I WAS CONCERNED. HER
ATTITUDE WAS SO DOWN.

630
00:32:14,200 --> 00:32:17,333
SHE DIDN'T SEEM TO BE
TRYING TO GET BETTER.

631
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:19,200
BUT I HAVE TO SAY, THIS
HORSE SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN

632
00:32:19,266 --> 00:32:21,300
JUST THE RIGHT MEDICINE
TO LIFT HER SPIRITS.

633
00:32:21,367 --> 00:32:22,300
- GINGER.

634
00:32:22,367 --> 00:32:24,799
- GINGER.

635
00:32:26,666 --> 00:32:29,367
- I STILL WORRY
ABOUT HER SOMETIMES.

636
00:32:31,833 --> 00:32:32,599
DR. OLSON--

637
00:32:32,666 --> 00:32:33,899
- HUGH.

638
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:35,666
HUGH.

639
00:32:37,899 --> 00:32:38,966
- HUGH.

640
00:32:49,533 --> 00:32:51,033
- HERE YOU GO.

641
00:32:55,833 --> 00:33:00,100
- NOW LISTEN GINGER, I'M
KEEPING MY END OF OUR DEAL.

642
00:33:00,166 --> 00:33:01,533
I'M WORKING MY BUTT OFF,

643
00:33:01,599 --> 00:33:04,066
AND JESSE SAYS I'M
GETTING BETTER.

644
00:33:04,133 --> 00:33:06,500
YOU'VE GOT TO TRY HARDER
AND LET ME HELP YOU

645
00:33:06,566 --> 00:33:09,133
GET YOUR LEG FIXED.

646
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,166
WE'RE GONNA RUN SO FAST,
THOSE GIRLS ARE GONNA

647
00:33:11,233 --> 00:33:15,200
BE SO SORRY THEY SAID
ANYTHING MEAN ABOUT YOU.

648
00:33:15,266 --> 00:33:16,566
YEAH.

649
00:33:16,632 --> 00:33:19,866
WE'RE GONNA LEAVE THEM WITH
A BIG MOUTHFUL OF DUST.

650
00:33:19,933 --> 00:33:22,200
YES, WE ARE. YES, WE ARE.

651
00:33:26,200 --> 00:33:30,467
DOES THAT FEEL A
LITTLE BIT BETTER?

652
00:34:05,899 --> 00:34:07,733
- HEY.

653
00:34:07,799 --> 00:34:10,100
JUST FINISHED BEDDING DOWN
AND FEEDING THE HORSES.

654
00:34:10,166 --> 00:34:11,333
EVERYTHING'S ALL
NICE AND QUIET.

655
00:34:11,400 --> 00:34:12,566
- GOOD.

656
00:34:12,632 --> 00:34:14,367
- I THOUGHT I'D GO OVER
THE WAGON WHEEL AND

657
00:34:14,433 --> 00:34:16,133
GET A BITE TO EAT.
WANNA COME ALONG?

658
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,100
- NO. NO THANKS, BUDDY.

659
00:34:18,166 --> 00:34:19,733
I'M NOT HUNGRY.

660
00:34:20,733 --> 00:34:22,200
- ALL RIGHT.

661
00:34:23,467 --> 00:34:25,100
HEY, NOW...

662
00:34:25,166 --> 00:34:27,833
DON'T YOU GO GETTING
DEPRESSED ON US, HUH?

663
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:31,200
WE WORKED THREE LONG
HARD YEARS TO END SOBER.

664
00:34:31,266 --> 00:34:32,467
DON'T MESS IT UP.

665
00:34:32,533 --> 00:34:34,400
- BUDDY, I'M FINE.

666
00:34:34,467 --> 00:34:36,133
YOU GO OUT AND HAVE
YOURSELF A GOOD DINNER.

667
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:37,467
SEE YOU BRIGHT AND

TACK ROOM DOOR.
IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.

00:36:27,467 --> 00:36:30,632
[GIRL BARKING]

697
00:36:33,333 --> 00:36:35,733
- THAT'S THE SOUND OF A
HAPPY LITTLE DOGGY KNOWING

698
00:36:35,799 --> 00:36:38,500
HER TUMMY IS GONNA BE
SO FULL OF GINGERBREAD.

699
00:36:38,566 --> 00:36:40,266
- SHUT UP, MELINDA!

700
00:36:41,433 --> 00:36:44,966
- WELL BEN'S TRAILER IS
GONE AND SO IS GINGER.

701
00:36:45,033 --> 00:36:47,833
NOW LET'S SEE,
WHAT'S ONE PLUS ONE.

702
00:36:47,899 --> 00:36:49,467
- SHUT UP!

703
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:56,333
- HEY! HEY!

704
00:36:57,133 --> 00:36:58,433
THAT'S IT. FIGHT'S OVER.

705
00:36:58,500 --> 00:36:59,933
COME ON. COME ON GIRLS.

706
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:00,833
GET UP.

707
00:37:00,899 --> 00:37:02,733
THAT'S IT. COME ON.

708
00:37:02,799 --> 00:37:04,400
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

709
00:37:04,467 --> 00:37:06,200
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

710
00:37:06,266 --> 00:37:07,733
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO PUT
YOURSELF BACK IN THE HOSPITAL

711
00:37:07,799 --> 00:37:10,233
OR JUST GIVE ME
A HEART ATTACK?

712
00:37:10,300 --> 00:37:11,966
- COME ON GIRLS,
START TALKING.

713
00:37:12,033 --> 00:37:13,400
- WELL I COULDN'T FIND YOU.

714
00:37:13,467 --> 00:37:17,233
SHE SAID YOU TOOK GINGER
TO THE DOG FOOD MAN.

715
00:37:19,632 --> 00:37:21,200
- GINGER'S FINE.

716
00:37:21,266 --> 00:37:22,699
NO ONE'S GONNA
HURT YOUR HORSE.

717
00:37:22,766 --> 00:37:24,300
WHAT IS GOING
THROUGH YOUR HEAD?

718
00:37:24,367 --> 00:37:26,833
DON'T SAY SOMETHING
HURTFUL LIKE THAT. HUH?

719
00:37:26,899 --> 00:37:27,999
- I DON'T KNOW.

720
00:37:28,066 --> 00:37:29,500
- WHY DON'T YOU GO THINK
ABOUT IT UNTIL YOU DO.

721
00:37:29,566 --> 00:37:31,666
WE DON'T TALK THAT
WAY AROUND HERE.

722
00:37:32,699 --> 00:37:34,066
- ARE YOU GONNA TELL DALLAS?

723
00:37:34,133 --> 00:37:35,866
- YOU GOT A REASON
I SHOULDN'T?

724
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,866
- SUNNY, I'M REAL SORRY.

725
00:37:41,933 --> 00:37:44,200
IF YOU WANT TO HATE ME,
YOU'VE GOT A RIGHT TO.

726
00:37:48,433 --> 00:37:52,433
- IT'S OKAY. I'M SORRY TOO.

727
00:37:58,666 --> 00:38:02,833
- WELL NOW, MRS. MATHEWS,
WOULD YOU AND SUNNY

728
00:38:02,899 --> 00:38:05,566
CARE TO JOIN ME ON
A SHORT TRIP?

729
00:38:05,632 --> 00:38:07,133
- WHERE TO?

730
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,367
- TO GO SEE GINGER.

731
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,733
- SHE SHOULD BE IN HER
RECOVERY STALL RIGHT UP HERE.

732
00:38:15,799 --> 00:38:18,033
SHE ALREADY HAD HER
SURGERY SO IT'S OKAY.

733
00:38:18,100 --> 00:38:19,933
GO ON IN. SAY HI.

734
00:38:22,266 --> 00:38:23,333
- IT'S OKAY, YOU
CAN TOUCH HER.

735
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,433
JUST BE CAREFUL.
A LITTLE SORE.

736
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:29,233
- GINGER, IT'S ME. IT'S ME.

737
00:38:30,300 --> 00:38:31,699
- BEN, WHO'S
GONNA PAY FOR THIS?

738
00:38:31,766 --> 00:38:34,066
- DOC SAID GINGER WAS SUCH
AN INTERESTING CASE THAT HE

739
00:38:34,133 --> 00:38:37,833
DID IT AS AN EXPERIMENT SO,
IT'S NOT GONNA COST A PENNY.

740
00:38:37,899 --> 00:38:40,100
HEY DOC, THIS HERE IS
KATHLEEN MATHEWS.

741
00:38:40,166 --> 00:38:41,566
HER DAUGHTER IS SUNNY.

742
00:38:41,632 --> 00:38:43,133
- HOWDY. NICE TO
MEET ALL OF YOU.

743
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,000
- DOC, TELL US
WHAT YOU FOUND.

744
00:38:45,066 --> 00:38:46,933
- AS IT TURNS OUT, THERE WAS
SIGNIFICANT DAMAGE TO THE

745
00:38:47,000 --> 00:38:49,766
FETLOCK BUT FORTUNATELY
MOST OF IT WAS SOFT TISSUE.

746
00:38:49,833 --> 00:38:52,632
I RECONSTRUCTED TWO
TENDONS AND REMOVED SOME

747
00:38:52,699 --> 00:38:54,433
BONE CHIPS FROM THE JOINT.

748
00:38:54,500 --> 00:38:56,367
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

749
00:38:56,433 --> 00:38:59,566
- THAT MEANS THAT I WOULD
GIVE HER ABOUT 30 DAYS OR SO

750
00:38:59,632 --> 00:39:01,933
BEFORE YOU RIDE HER,
BUT SHE SHOULD BE FINE.

751
00:39:01,999 --> 00:39:03,467
- GINGER, DID YOU HEAR THAT?

752
00:39:03,533 --> 00:39:05,799
YOU'RE GONNA BE THE FASTEST
HORSY IN THE WHOLE WORLD.

753
00:39:05,866 --> 00:39:06,999
YES, YOU ARE.

754
00:39:07,066 --> 00:39:08,799
- OKAY, I THINK IT'S
TIME WE WENT HOME.

755
00:39:10,000 --> 00:39:11,766
- I THINK GINGER COULD
USE A LITTLE REST.

756
00:39:11,833 --> 00:39:14,367
- OKAY. BYE, GINGER.

757
00:39:14,433 --> 00:39:15,833
I'LL SEE YOU LATER, OKAY?

758
00:39:15,899 --> 00:39:16,799
- WHAT DO YOU SAY?

759
00:39:16,866 --> 00:39:18,333
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

760
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:20,133
- WHY DON'T YOU GO ON AHEAD.

761
00:39:20,200 --> 00:39:21,533
I'LL BE WITH YOU
IN JUST A MINUTE.

762
00:39:26,933 --> 00:39:30,599
DOC, THERE'S 2,000.

763
00:39:31,699 --> 00:39:32,566
I'LL HAVE THE OTHER
EIGHT NEXT MONTH.

764
00:39:32,632 --> 00:39:33,632
- THAT'S A DEAL.

765
00:39:33,699 --> 00:39:35,632
- THANKS. THANKS FOR
PLAYING ALONG.

766
00:39:35,699 --> 00:39:36,966
- NOT A PROBLEM, BEN.

767
00:39:37,033 --> 00:39:38,433
- GINGER LOOKS GREAT.

768
00:39:42,367 --> 00:39:44,866
- WELL, DOC SAYS GINGER CAN
COME HOME IN A FEW DAYS.

769
00:39:44,933 --> 00:39:46,266
- OKAY, I WANT TO
MAKE THIS CLEAR.

770
00:39:46,333 --> 00:39:47,333
THIS DOESN'T CHANGE ANYTHING.

771
00:39:47,400 --> 00:39:48,599
SUNNY CAN'T RIDE HER.

772
00:39:48,666 --> 00:39:49,833
- BUT MOM, THAT'S NOT FAIR.

773
00:39:49,899 --> 00:39:51,333
- SUNNY, THAT'S THE
END OF THIS DISCUSSION.

774
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:52,566
YOU AND I HAVE AN AGREEMENT.

775
00:39:52,632 --> 00:39:53,966
- IF Y'ALL AREN'T DOING
ANYTHING RIGHT NOW,

776
00:39:54,033 --> 00:39:55,666
I'D LIKE TO SHOW
YOU SOMETHING.

777
00:39:55,733 --> 00:39:56,632
- I'M SORRY, WE HAVE PLANS.

778
00:39:56,699 --> 00:39:58,066
- NO, WE DON'T.
- EXCUSE ME?

779
00:39:58,133 --> 00:40:00,433
- LOOK, IT WON'T TAKE LONG.
LUNCH IS ON ME.

780
00:40:00,500 --> 00:40:03,166
- COME ON, PLEASE MOM?

781
00:40:03,233 --> 00:40:04,566
- EXACTLY WHERE
WOULD WE BE GOING?

782
00:40:04,632 --> 00:40:05,799
- WITH ALL DUE
RESPECT, MA'AM,

783
00:40:05,866 --> 00:40:08,533
I'D KIND OF LIKE THAT
TO BE A SURPRISE. HOP IN.

784
00:40:08,599 --> 00:40:10,266
- PLEASE? COME ON.

785
00:40:10,333 --> 00:40:12,666
- ALL RIGHT, BUT WE
CAN'T STAY OUT LONG.

786
00:40:12,733 --> 00:40:14,266
- YOU'RE THE GREATEST!

787
00:40:19,266 --> 00:40:20,500
- ANNOUNCER: FOLKS, NO RODEO
WOULD BE COMPLETE WITHOUT

788
00:40:20,566 --> 00:40:24,566
LADIES RODEO. UP NEXT,
MISS MELINDA JOHN.

789
00:40:28,500 --> 00:40:30,166
- HAH!

790
00:40:31,833 --> 00:40:33,533
YAH!

791
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:37,500
COME ON BOY!

792
00:40:37,566 --> 00:40:39,100
GO!

793
00:40:40,467 --> 00:40:41,733
YAH!

794
00:40:43,500 --> 00:40:44,866
- SUNNY, WHAT DID YOU THINK?

795
00:40:44,933 --> 00:40:46,233
- MELINDA WAS GREAT.

796
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:48,400
HER HORSE WAS AS FAST
AS LIGHTENING.

797
00:40:48,467 --> 00:40:49,599
CAN GINGER GO THAT FAST?

798
00:40:49,666 --> 00:40:50,966
- I DON'T KNOW. WE'LL SEE.

799
00:40:51,033 --> 00:40:52,000
- WE'LL SEE.

800
00:40:53,266 --> 00:40:54,666
- YOU KNOW, MELINDA IS
THE ONE WHO SAID THOSE

801
00:40:54,733 --> 00:40:56,300
MEAN THINGS ABOUT GINGER.

802
00:40:56,367 --> 00:40:57,433
- WELL, DON'T HOLD
IT AGAINST HER.

803
00:40:57,500 --> 00:40:58,733
SHE'S GOT A HARD ROW TO HOE.

804
00:40:58,799 --> 00:41:01,000
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
HARD ROW TO HOE.

805
00:41:01,066 --> 00:41:04,367
- IT MEANS MELINDA'S
GOT A LOT OF PROBLEMS.

806
00:41:04,433 --> 00:41:08,666
IN YOU GO. WATCH YOUR TOES.

807
00:41:11,367 --> 00:41:13,100
- YOU KNOW, YOU REALLY
SET ME UP HERE.

808
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:16,599
- MRS. MATHEWS, I JUST WANTED
SUNNY TO SEE A REAL RODEO.

809
00:41:16,666 --> 00:41:18,833
- WOULD YOU JUST
TAKE US HOME PLEASE.

810
00:41:18,899 --> 00:41:22,200
- YOU KNOW, EXPERIENCE HAS
TAUGHT ME WHEN A KID LOVES A

811
00:41:22,266 --> 00:41:25,300
HORSE THIS MUCH AND
WANTS TO RIDE SO BAD,

812
00:41:25,367 --> 00:41:28,266
THERE'S NOTHING ANYBODY CAN
DO EXCEPT TO LOVE THEM,

813
00:41:28,333 --> 00:41:30,799
GUIDE THEM AND STAY THE
HECK OUT OF THE WAY.

814
00:41:39,233 --> 00:41:40,266
- THAT WAS FUN, HUH MOM?

815
00:41:40,333 --> 00:41:41,632
- YEAH, GREAT FUN.

816
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:58,367
- HEY BUDDY. YOU SEEN SUNNY
AROUND THIS MORNING?

817
00:41:58,433 --> 00:42:00,666
- OH, YEAH, YEAH. SHE'S
AROUND HERE SOMEPLACE.

818
00:42:00,733 --> 00:42:03,599
I GOT TO TELL YOU, SHE
KEEPS HERSELF BUSY

819
00:42:03,666 --> 00:42:05,333
WITH THAT BAD LEG AND ALL.

820
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:07,567
SHE'S A CUTIE PIE.

821
00:42:09,300 --> 00:42:11,233
- WE'RE MAKING IT.

822
00:42:11,300 --> 00:42:13,533
YES, WE WON GINGER!

823
00:42:13,599 --> 00:42:14,467
WE WON!

824
00:42:14,533 --> 00:42:15,599
YES, WE DID.

825
00:42:15,666 --> 00:42:17,333
GINGER, WE WON!

826
00:42:17,400 --> 00:42:18,933
- THAT AIN'T
ALLOWED AROUND HERE.

827
00:42:19,999 --> 00:42:22,200
AT LEAST NOT
WITHOUT A GOOD HAT.

828
00:42:24,367 --> 00:42:26,799
EVERY REAL COWGIRL
SHOULD HAVE ONE.

829
00:42:30,966 --> 00:42:32,833
THAT'S IT. KEEP RIDING.

830
00:42:49,899 --> 00:42:51,866
- HEY.
- HEY.

831
00:42:51,933 --> 00:42:53,632
- WHICH ONE IS SUNNY'S PILE?

832
00:42:53,699 --> 00:42:56,166
- THE ONE ON THE RIGHT.

833
00:42:57,333 --> 00:42:59,766
- YOUR DAD GAVE ME
THIS BEFORE HE DIED.

834
00:42:59,833 --> 00:43:00,866
I DON'T KNOW WHAT IT'S WORTH,

835
00:43:00,933 --> 00:43:03,266
BUT I KNOW IT'S
WORTH SOMETHING.

836
00:43:03,333 --> 00:43:04,699
- YOU SURE BUDDY?

837
00:43:04,766 --> 00:43:06,266
THAT WATCH IS YOUR
PRIDE AND JOY.

838
00:43:06,333 --> 00:43:10,766
- IT IS. BUT SHE'S MY
PRIDE AND JOY NOW.

839
00:43:12,599 --> 00:43:14,166
- I APPRECIATE THAT.

840
00:43:31,233 --> 00:43:32,467
- WELL DON'T JUST STAND
THERE WITH YOUR TEETH

841
00:43:32,533 --> 00:43:33,899
IN YOUR MOUTH. WHAT IS IT?

842
00:43:33,966 --> 00:43:36,333
- I'M FINISHED
CLEANING THE STALLS.

843
00:43:36,400 --> 00:43:37,400
- DID YOU FILL
THE WATER BARRELS.

844
00:43:37,467 --> 00:43:39,166
- YEP.

845
00:43:39,233 --> 00:43:40,533
WHAT ARE THESE?

846
00:43:40,599 --> 00:43:43,200
- SOME OLD JUNK
I KEEP AROUND.

847
00:43:44,233 --> 00:43:45,433
- WHERE DID YOU
BUY THIS ONE?

848
00:43:45,500 --> 00:43:46,899
- I WON IT. I WAS YOUNGER.

849
00:43:46,966 --> 00:43:50,100
I USED TO DO RODEOING.

850
00:43:50,899 --> 00:43:52,699
- ARE THESE REAL GOLD?

851
00:43:52,766 --> 00:43:54,933
- 18 KARAT SOLID GOLD.

852
00:43:54,999 --> 00:43:56,266
- YOU MUST REALLY LOVE THEM.

853
00:43:56,333 --> 00:43:59,632
- YEAH. I WOULDN'T TRADE
THOSE SPURS FOR ANYTHING.

854
00:43:59,699 --> 00:44:01,666
- WHY'D YOU QUIT
BEING A COWBOY?

855
00:44:03,899 --> 00:44:05,367
WHO ARE THEY?

856
00:44:06,666 --> 00:44:09,933
- THE UGLY ONE'S ME.

857
00:44:09,999 --> 00:44:11,567
DALLAS YOU KNOW.

858
00:44:11,632 --> 00:44:13,699
- WHO'S THE LITTLE GIRL?

859
00:44:14,632 --> 00:44:15,966
- GO ON, GO ON,
GET OUT OF HERE!

860
00:44:16,033 --> 00:44:17,433
GO FEED THE HORSES
BEFORE THEY CLIMB

861
00:44:17,500 --> 00:44:18,433
OUT OF THEIR STALLS.

862
00:44:18,500 --> 00:44:20,233
GO.

863
00:44:43,699 --> 00:44:46,599
- BEN, WE NEED TO TALK.

864
00:44:46,666 --> 00:44:48,066
- SAY WHAT'S ON
YOUR MIND, DALLAS.

865
00:44:48,133 --> 00:44:50,200
DON'T SUGARCOAT
IT OR NOTHING.

866
00:44:50,266 --> 00:44:52,933
- MELINDA WON'T BE TAKING
LESSONS FROM YOU ANYMORE.

867
00:44:52,999 --> 00:44:54,100
- YOUR MONEY.

868
00:44:54,166 --> 00:44:55,866
BY THE WAY, I SAW
MELINDA'S NEW HORSE AT THE

869
00:44:55,933 --> 00:44:58,300
RODEO THE OTHER NIGHT.
STEEL'S A GOOD HORSE.

870
00:44:58,367 --> 00:44:59,966
- WE'RE GONNA STABLE
HIM AT OUR PLACE.

871
00:45:00,033 --> 00:45:02,100
- THAT'S SWELL.

872
00:45:02,166 --> 00:45:03,966
- I SUPPOSE YOU DON'T WANT
MELINDA RIDING OVER HERE

873
00:45:04,033 --> 00:45:05,367
WITH HER FRIENDS.

874
00:45:05,433 --> 00:45:08,166
- MELINDA CAN RIDE OVER
HERE ANY TIME SHE PLEASES.

875
00:45:08,233 --> 00:45:11,599
- BEN? ARE YOU FEELING OKAY?

876
00:45:11,666 --> 00:45:14,367
- DALLAS, YOU
REMEMBER WHAT HAPPENED.

877
00:45:14,433 --> 00:45:16,799
DON'T YOU DO THE SAME THING.

878
00:45:19,866 --> 00:45:22,033
- SHE CAN MAKE IT
TO THE TOP, BEN.

879
00:45:22,100 --> 00:45:25,066
AND I'M GOING TO MAKE
SURE SHE GETS THERE.

880
00:45:25,133 --> 00:45:28,033
- I SAW HER AT THE RODEO.
SHE STANDS A CHANCE.

881
00:45:28,100 --> 00:45:30,066
IF YOU DON'T
RIDE HER SO HARD.

882
00:45:30,133 --> 00:45:31,666
- REALLY, BEN.

883
00:45:31,733 --> 00:45:35,433
I CAN'T BELIEVE THIS
COMING FROM YOU.

884
00:45:35,500 --> 00:45:39,066
YOU'RE NOTHING BUT A CACTUS
COVERED MARSHMALLOW.

885
00:45:39,133 --> 00:45:41,599
IF YOU WANT TO WIN,
YOU'VE GOT TO GRAB IT.

886
00:45:41,666 --> 00:45:44,066
NOBODY'S GONNA
HAND IT TO YOU.

887
00:45:44,133 --> 00:45:47,000
AND YOU THINK OUR
PAST TO MAKE A POINT.

888
00:45:47,066 --> 00:45:49,333
IT'S CHEAP, BEN.

889
00:45:49,400 --> 00:45:52,033
MELINDA'S GOING
TO BE A WINNER.

890
00:45:52,100 --> 00:45:54,433
I'M NOTHING LIKE YOU.

891
00:45:55,166 --> 00:45:56,733
- YOU'RE RIGHT, DALLAS.

892
00:45:56,799 --> 00:45:58,133
- HOW IS THAT, BEN?

893
00:45:58,200 --> 00:46:00,632
- YOU'RE USING MELINDA
TO MAKE YOUR POINT.

894
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:09,866
- HEY THERE.

895
00:46:09,933 --> 00:46:13,200
- HI. WHATCHA DOING?

896
00:46:13,266 --> 00:46:16,533
- GOOD COWBOY TAKES
CARE OF HIS TACK.

897
00:46:21,666 --> 00:46:25,500
- I'M DONE.
- I FIGURED.

898
00:46:27,166 --> 00:46:29,999
- YOU KNOW MY MOM
IS REALLY MAD AT YOU.

899
00:46:30,066 --> 00:46:31,666
- I FIGURED THAT TOO.

900
00:46:33,632 --> 00:46:35,799
- SHE DOESN'T
WANT ME TO RIDE.

901
00:46:35,866 --> 00:46:39,333
- YEAH. SHE'S AFRAID
YOU'RE GONNA GET HURT.

902
00:46:40,799 --> 00:46:42,599
- COULD YOU TALK TO HER?

903
00:46:43,799 --> 00:46:46,966
- WELL, THAT'S BETWEEN
YOU AND YOUR MOM.

904
00:46:47,033 --> 00:46:50,266
SEE, I ALREADY STUCK MY NOSE
IN WHERE IT DON'T BELONG.

905
00:46:50,333 --> 00:46:51,833
I'LL TELL YOU
ONE THING THOUGH,

906
00:46:51,899 --> 00:46:53,699
YOU WANT TO RIDE GINGER,

907
00:46:53,766 --> 00:46:55,500
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO DO YOUR THERAPY.

908
00:46:55,567 --> 00:46:57,666
IT TAKES GOOD STRONG
LEGS TO RIDE A HORSE.

909
00:46:57,733 --> 00:47:01,599
GIMPY ONE LIKE YOURS
ISN'T GONNA CUT IT.

910
00:47:02,933 --> 00:47:04,899
- I'M GONNA RIDE GINGER.

911
00:47:06,367 --> 00:47:09,799
- YEAH? WE'LL SEE.

912
00:47:11,599 --> 00:47:12,699
- HE'S NOT A DOCTOR.

913
00:47:12,766 --> 00:47:14,300
HE DOESN'T KNOW WHAT'S
GOOD FOR YOUR LEG.

914
00:47:14,367 --> 00:47:15,400
- YES, HE DOES.

915
00:47:15,467 --> 00:47:16,899
HE SAID MY LEG
WASN'T STRONG ENOUGH.

916
00:47:16,966 --> 00:47:19,933
HE SAID I'LL HAVE TO DO MY
THERAPY IF I WANT TO RIDE.

917
00:47:19,999 --> 00:47:21,333
YOU JUST DON'T LIKE HIM.

918
00:47:21,400 --> 00:47:22,599
- I DON'T DISLIKE
HIM, SUNNY.

919
00:47:22,666 --> 00:47:24,467
I JUST DON'T LIKE HIM
MEDDLING IN OUR BUSINESS.

920
00:47:24,533 --> 00:47:25,899
- HE'S JUST
TRYING TO HELP ME.

921
00:47:25,966 --> 00:47:28,799
- YOU ARE NOT RIDING
AND THAT'S FINAL.

922
00:47:30,999 --> 00:47:34,133
- HI. I JUST SENT SUNNY
DOWN TO PHYSICAL THERAPY.

923
00:47:34,200 --> 00:47:37,866
NOW SHE WANTS TO RIDE THE
HORSE AND BEN'S GOT HER

924
00:47:37,933 --> 00:47:39,100
BELIEVING SHE CAN DO IT.

925
00:47:39,166 --> 00:47:40,433
- BEN AGAIN.

926
00:47:40,500 --> 00:47:42,666
- I WOULD REALLY FEEL
BETTER IF YOU WERE INVOLVED.

927
00:47:42,733 --> 00:47:44,666
- WELL, I'LL GO OUT THERE
AND CHECK ON THINGS

928
00:47:44,733 --> 00:47:45,699
IF YOU'D LIKE THAT.

929
00:47:45,766 --> 00:47:47,333
- WOULD YOU DO THAT HUGH?

930
00:47:47,400 --> 00:47:49,166
[CHUCKLES]

931
00:47:49,233 --> 00:47:50,899
- WHAT?

932
00:47:50,966 --> 00:47:52,966
- YOU CALLED ME HUGH.

933
00:47:58,467 --> 00:48:00,233
- WHAT'S GOTTEN INTO HER?

934
00:48:00,300 --> 00:48:01,500
SHE'S GONE CRAZY.

935
00:48:01,567 --> 00:48:03,100
- IN A GOOD WAY, I HOPE.

936
00:48:03,166 --> 00:48:05,200
- 110 PERCENT, DOC.

937
00:48:05,266 --> 00:48:07,133
I MEAN, I'M GONNA
HAVE TO SLOW HER DOWN.

938
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:09,033
SHE'S BURNING UP
ALL OF OUR MACHINES.

939
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:10,933
LOOK AT HER.

940
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:14,133
- BEN! BEN!

941
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:17,766
BEN! BEN! BEN!

942
00:48:17,833 --> 00:48:19,833
DR. OLSON IS GONNA COME
OUT AND SEE GINGER.

943
00:48:19,899 --> 00:48:21,733
IF HE THINKS IT'S
OKAY, I CAN RIDE.

944
00:48:21,799 --> 00:48:23,033
- IS THAT SO?

945
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,033
- I'VE BEEN DOING MY
THERAPY JUST LIKE YOU SAID.

946
00:48:25,100 --> 00:48:26,533
- THAT A GIRL.

947
00:48:26,599 --> 00:48:28,467
- AND JESSE SAYS
IF I KEEP WORKING,

948
00:48:28,533 --> 00:48:32,500
I MIGHT BE STRONG ENOUGH
BY THE TIME GINGER'S WELL.

949
00:48:32,567 --> 00:48:34,999
- I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THAT.

950
00:48:35,066 --> 00:48:36,632
YOU'VE GOT TO PROMISE ME
YOU'RE NOT GONNA TRY TO RIDE

951
00:48:36,699 --> 00:48:38,467
GINGER UNTIL I SAY IT'S OKAY.

952
00:48:38,533 --> 00:48:40,300
- I PROMISE.

953
00:48:42,567 --> 00:48:44,599
MY MOM SAYS YOU'RE A
BAD INFLUENCE ON ME.

954
00:48:44,666 --> 00:48:46,133
- IS THAT SO?

955
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:47,300
WHAT ELSE SHE SAY?

956
00:48:47,367 --> 00:48:49,400
- SHE DOESN'T LIKE
THE WAY YOU LOOK.

957
00:48:49,467 --> 00:48:50,699
- IS THAT A FACT?

958
00:48:50,766 --> 00:48:51,933
- YEP.

959
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:54,866
I GOTTA GO. MY MOM'S
COOKING DINNER.

960
00:48:55,467 --> 00:48:56,300
BYE BYE GINGER.

961
00:48:56,367 --> 00:48:57,599
- BYE.

962
00:48:58,599 --> 00:49:00,833
- GINGER, WHAT DO YOU THINK?

963
00:49:03,066 --> 00:49:04,333
I THOUGHT SO.

964
00:49:10,467 --> 00:49:13,733
- HEY, COWBOY, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

965
00:49:14,833 --> 00:49:17,599
- DALLAS, YOU
TOLD ME TO STOP BY.

966
00:49:18,599 --> 00:49:20,033
- BEN?

967
00:49:22,766 --> 00:49:24,300
WELL, I'LL BE!

968
00:49:24,367 --> 00:49:26,400
IS THAT REALLY YOU?

969
00:49:26,467 --> 00:49:28,266
- DALLAS, WHAT
IS IT YOU WANT?

970
00:49:29,367 --> 00:49:31,166
- JOHNNY'S GOING
TO TEACH MELINDA.

971
00:49:31,233 --> 00:49:33,567
- I SAID I'D TEACH
HER IF YOU AGREED, BEN.

972
00:49:33,632 --> 00:49:36,133
I AIN'T TRYING TO
CUT IN ON YOUR DEAL.

973
00:49:36,200 --> 00:49:37,799
- YOU'RE WELCOME
TO HER, JOHNNY.

974
00:49:37,866 --> 00:49:38,833
- ARE YOU SURE?

975
00:49:38,899 --> 00:49:41,433
- JOHNNY, YOU'D BE
DOING ME A FAVOR.

976
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,033
DALLAS HERE WAS ABOUT
TO DRIVE ME TO DRINK,

977
00:49:43,100 --> 00:49:44,266
WEREN'T YOU DALLAS?

978
00:49:44,333 --> 00:49:46,632
- NOW DON'T EXAGGERATE, BEN.

979
00:49:46,699 --> 00:49:48,266
WE DON'T SEE EYE TO
EYE ALL THE TIME,

980
00:49:48,333 --> 00:49:51,200
BUT THERE AREN'T
ANY HARD FEELINGS.

981
00:49:53,266 --> 00:49:55,966
- DALLAS, ONE DAY YOU'LL
MAKE SOMEBODY

982
00:49:56,033 --> 00:49:58,033
A GREAT HUSBAND.

983
00:49:59,666 --> 00:50:00,966
- FUNNY.

984
00:50:11,333 --> 00:50:13,999
- HEY ROCKY, WE'RE GONNA
GO DOWN TO THE RESERVOIR

985
00:50:14,066 --> 00:50:15,933
AND TAKE A SWIM. YOU
WANNA COME WITH US?

986
00:50:15,999 --> 00:50:18,333
- GEE, I'D LOVE TO.
BUT I CAN'T.

987
00:50:18,400 --> 00:50:19,866
I'VE STILL GOT A
LOT OF CHORES TO DO.

988
00:50:19,933 --> 00:50:21,200
THANKS ANYWAY.

989
00:50:21,266 --> 00:50:22,966
- WELL MAYBE NEXT TIME.

990
00:50:26,300 --> 00:50:28,467
- HI, MY NAME'S
SUSAN, AND THIS IS

991
00:50:28,533 --> 00:50:29,766
WHERE MY HORSE POKEY LIVES.

992
00:50:29,833 --> 00:50:31,333
YOU WANT SOME HELP,
SUNNY?

993
00:50:31,400 --> 00:50:33,333
- SURE, THANKS.

994
00:50:33,400 --> 00:50:35,567
I WAS KIND OF EXPECTING HER
TO SAY SOMETHING MEAN AGAIN.

995
00:50:35,632 --> 00:50:38,300
- NO ONE EVER STOOD
UP TO HER BEFORE.

996
00:50:38,367 --> 00:50:40,033
SHE'S BEEN TALKING
ABOUT IT ALL WEEK.

997
00:50:40,100 --> 00:50:42,300
SAID YOU TACKLED HER
RIGHT INTO THE GROUND.

998
00:50:42,367 --> 00:50:44,833
SHE CALLS YOU ROCKY
LIKE THE BOXER.

999
00:50:44,899 --> 00:50:47,833
- THAT'S WHAT SHE MEANT.

1000
00:50:47,899 --> 00:50:50,200
- HAVE YOU EVER MET DALLAS?

1001
00:50:50,266 --> 00:50:52,433
- I THINK I'VE SEEN HER OUT
IN THE RING WITH MELINDA.

1002
00:50:52,500 --> 00:50:54,666
WHY IS SHE SO HARD ON HER?

1003
00:50:54,733 --> 00:50:56,933
- YOU WANT TO
KNOW THE STORY?

1004
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,233
- SURE.

1005
00:51:01,699 --> 00:51:04,400
- WELL, THIS IS
WHAT MY MOM TOLD ME.

1006
00:51:04,467 --> 00:51:06,233
BEN MARRIED DALLAS A YEAR
BEFORE BEN'S

1007
00:51:06,300 --> 00:51:08,266
DAUGHTER SHERRY DIED.

1008
00:51:08,333 --> 00:51:09,666
- THAT MUST BE THE LITTLE
GIRL I SAW IN THE PICTURE

1009
00:51:09,733 --> 00:51:11,333
WITH DALLAS AND BEN.

1010
00:51:11,400 --> 00:51:13,200
- AND RIGHT AFTER SHERRY
DIED, DALLAS AND BEN

1011
00:51:13,266 --> 00:51:15,000
GOT A DIVORCE.

1012
00:51:15,066 --> 00:51:18,266
MEANWHILE, DALLAS' OWN
DAUGHTER, SHANNON, ELOPED AND

1013
00:51:18,333 --> 00:51:20,866
HAD A BABY, AND SHE AND
HER HUSBAND MOVED TO SOUTH

1014
00:51:20,933 --> 00:51:24,933
AMERICA, AND THEY LEFT
THE BABY WITH DALLAS.

1015
00:51:24,999 --> 00:51:26,966
- MELINDA IS DALLAS'
GRANDDAUGHTER?

1016
00:51:27,033 --> 00:51:30,166
- UH-HUH, ANYWAYS, MOM SAYS
DALLAS BLAMES HERSELF FOR

1017
00:51:30,233 --> 00:51:32,567
WHAT HAPPENED TO SHANNON ON
ACCOUNT SHE WAS THIS BIG

1018
00:51:32,632 --> 00:51:34,966
RODEO QUEEN AND WAS NEVER
HOME TO TAKE CARE OF HER.

1019
00:51:35,033 --> 00:51:37,100
SO WHEN MELINDA CAME ALONG,
IT WAS LIKE A SECOND

1020
00:51:37,166 --> 00:51:38,966
CHANCE TO DO IT RIGHT.

1021
00:51:39,033 --> 00:51:40,999
- SOUNDS LIKE MELINDA'S
GOT A HARD ROW TO HOE.

1022
00:51:41,066 --> 00:51:42,266
- WHAT?

1023
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:43,833
- WELL, THAT'S
WHAT BEN SAID.

1024
00:51:43,899 --> 00:51:46,133
MELINDA'S GOT A
HARD ROW TO HOE.

1025
00:51:46,200 --> 00:51:49,866
- OH, OKAY.

1026
00:51:51,799 --> 00:51:55,166
- GOOD GIRL, GOOD GIRL.

1027
00:51:55,233 --> 00:51:57,500
NOT BAD FOR BEING LAID
UP FOR FIVE MONTHS, HUH?

1028
00:51:57,567 --> 00:52:04,966
- WOW.

1029
00:52:05,033 --> 00:52:07,333
- SHE'S LOOKING
GOOD NOW, BEN.

1030
00:52:07,400 --> 00:52:09,733
WHAT'S SHE GONNA LOOK LIKE
WHEN SHE GETS IN SHAPE?

1031
00:52:09,799 --> 00:52:11,666
- BETTER AND
BETTER, RIGHT, SUNNY?

1032
00:52:11,733 --> 00:52:14,200
- YEAH.

1033
00:52:14,266 --> 00:52:16,666
- NOT BAD.

1034
00:52:19,899 --> 00:52:21,467
YEAH.

1035
00:52:21,533 --> 00:52:24,632
- BEN, SHE'S FABULOUS.

1036
00:52:24,699 --> 00:52:27,866
- WOW.

1037
00:52:33,133 --> 00:52:42,033
- SHE'S AS FRISKY
AS A YOUNG FILLY.

1038
00:52:42,100 --> 00:52:45,933
- COME ON IN,
BEEN EXPECTING YOU.

1039
00:52:45,999 --> 00:52:49,833
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN BY THAT?

1040
00:52:49,899 --> 00:52:51,866
- WELL, YOU'RE HERE TO TELL
ME THAT IF ANYTHING HAPPENS

1041
00:52:51,933 --> 00:52:55,666
TO SUNNY, YOU'RE GOING TO
BLAME ME, IS THAT RIGHT?

1042
00:52:55,733 --> 00:53:00,433
- SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

1043
00:53:00,500 --> 00:53:05,367
- LOOK, MISS MATTHEWS, I
DON'T WANT TO ARGUE WITH YOU.

1044
00:53:05,433 --> 00:53:07,266
YOU WANT TO BLAME ME IF
SOMETHING HAPPENS,

1045
00:53:07,333 --> 00:53:09,467
THAT'S FINE.

1046
00:53:09,533 --> 00:53:12,599
I CAN LIVE WITH THAT.

1047
00:53:12,666 --> 00:53:14,866
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO.

1048
00:53:18,133 --> 00:53:20,300
YOU LOOK BETTER
WITHOUT THE HAIR.

1049
00:53:24,899 --> 00:53:26,567
- WHAT ABOUT A SADDLE?

1050
00:53:26,632 --> 00:53:28,300
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LET HER
RIDE BAREBACK, ARE YOU?

1051
00:53:28,367 --> 00:53:31,733
- NOT HARDLY.

1052
00:53:31,799 --> 00:53:36,733
- EASY THERE, GINGER.

1053
00:53:36,799 --> 00:53:42,632
HEY, SUNNY, FROM NOW ON
THIS WILL BE YOUR SADDLE.

1054
00:53:42,699 --> 00:53:44,200
- WAIT A MINUTE, BEN.

1055
00:53:44,266 --> 00:53:46,266
- NOW, MRS. MATTHEWS, IT'S
JUST AN OLD KID'S SADDLE, I

1056
00:53:46,333 --> 00:53:47,799
DON'T HAVE ANY USE FOR IT.

1057
00:53:47,866 --> 00:53:49,367
SUNNY MIGHT AS WELL HAVE IT.

1058
00:53:49,433 --> 00:53:51,000
- SUNNY, I WANT YOU
TO WATCH ME DO THIS.

1059
00:53:51,066 --> 00:53:55,433
YOU'RE GOING TO
HAVE TO LEARN HOW.

1060
00:53:57,799 --> 00:54:00,000
- SUNNY, YOU REMEMBER ALL
THE THINGS I TOLD YOU.

1061
00:54:00,066 --> 00:54:01,400
- UH-HUH.

1062
00:54:01,467 --> 00:54:02,833
- NOW WE'RE GOING TO GO
THROUGH THEM ONE MORE TIME

1063
00:54:02,899 --> 00:54:04,233
BEFORE YOU TURN YOU LOOSE.

1064
00:54:04,300 --> 00:54:05,666
- OKAY.

1065
00:54:05,733 --> 00:54:09,266
- ALL RIGHT, COME
ON UP HERE, COME ON.

1066
00:54:09,333 --> 00:54:10,766
HERE YOU GO, READY?

1067
00:54:10,833 --> 00:54:12,133
- UH-HUH.

1068
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:13,899
- UP WE GO.

1069
00:54:13,966 --> 00:54:15,733
IN THE STIRRUPS.

1070
00:54:15,799 --> 00:54:17,333
- OKAY.

1071
00:54:17,400 --> 00:54:19,300
- HERE'S THE REIN, HONEY.

1072
00:54:19,367 --> 00:54:21,133
- THERE YOU GO, KEEP
THOSE HEELS DOWN.

1073
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:22,866
ALL RIGHT, SHOW ME HOW
YOU HOLD THOSE REINS.

1074
00:54:22,933 --> 00:54:24,666
GOOD, KEEP A GOOD
GRIP ON THOSE REINS.

1075
00:54:24,733 --> 00:54:26,400
YOU DROP THOSE,
SHE'LL TAKE OFF.

1076
00:54:26,467 --> 00:54:28,733
SHOW ME HOW YOU
TURN TO THE RIGHT.

1077
00:54:28,799 --> 00:54:31,666
GOOD, TURN TO THE LEFT.

1078
00:54:31,733 --> 00:54:33,966
REAL GOOD, SHOW ME HOW
YOU STOP HER, GOOD.

1079
00:54:34,033 --> 00:54:35,733
DON'T BE AFRAID
TO PULL BACK HARD.

1080
00:54:35,799 --> 00:54:37,766
SHE'S A BIG HORSE,
SHE CAN HANDLE IT.

1081
00:54:37,833 --> 00:54:39,367
- AND IF YOU RUN INTO SOME
TROUBLE, YOU JUST HOLD ONTO

1082
00:54:39,433 --> 00:54:41,133
THAT SADDLE HORN.

1083
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,632
- AND SUNNY, IF YOUR LEG
STARTS TO HURT,

1084
00:54:42,699 --> 00:54:44,367
YOU JUST STOP, RIGHT?

1085
00:54:44,433 --> 00:54:45,933
- READY TO GIVE HER A TRY?

1086
00:54:45,999 --> 00:54:49,666
ALL RIGHT, LET'S
GO, COME ON GINGER.

1087
00:54:49,733 --> 00:54:52,233
THERE YOU GO.

1088
00:54:52,300 --> 00:54:54,999
- HONEY, YOU BE CAREFUL.

1089
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,100
- SO FAR SO GOOD.

1090
00:54:59,166 --> 00:55:01,266
- YEAH.

1091
00:55:01,333 --> 00:55:02,933
HOW ABOUT THAT?

1092
00:55:02,999 --> 00:55:05,500
- UH-HUH.

1093
00:55:05,567 --> 00:55:08,200
- SHE'S A DARLING.

1094
00:55:08,266 --> 00:55:10,200
- LOOK, LOOK, I'M RIDING.

1095
00:55:10,266 --> 00:55:11,533
- SUNNY, SLOW DOWN.

1096
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:13,200
- KEEP IT SLOW, GAL.

1097
00:55:13,266 --> 00:55:14,833
- BEN, SHE WANTS TO
GO, I CAN FEEL IT.

1098
00:55:14,899 --> 00:55:16,999
- NO, NO, KEEP A TIGHT
GRIP ON THOSE REINS.

1099
00:55:17,066 --> 00:55:18,799
YOU'RE BE READY
TO RUN HER YET.

1100
00:55:18,866 --> 00:55:20,166
KEEP THE REINS TIGHT.

1101
00:55:20,233 --> 00:55:21,533
- SUNNY, YOU LISTEN
TO BEN, DO YOU HEAR ME?

1102
00:55:21,599 --> 00:55:25,866
- YES, MOM.

1103
00:55:34,300 --> 00:55:37,666
- SUNNY, SUNNY TAKE IT EASY.

1104
00:55:37,733 --> 00:55:38,966
SUNNY!

1105
00:55:39,033 --> 00:55:40,033
- SUNNY, SLOW DOWN!

1106
00:55:40,100 --> 00:55:42,866
- SUNNY!

1107
00:55:42,933 --> 00:55:44,799
SUNNY!

1108
00:55:44,866 --> 00:55:45,933
EASY, GINGER.

1109
00:55:45,999 --> 00:55:48,599
GINGER, GINGER.

1110
00:55:48,666 --> 00:55:53,066
YOUNG LADY, YOU CLIMB DOWN
OFF THAT HORSE RIGHT NOW!

1111
00:55:56,233 --> 00:55:58,233
NOW YOU JUST MADE
THREE BIG MISTAKES.

1112
00:55:58,300 --> 00:56:00,599
NUMBER ONE, YOU RAN GINGER
BEFORE SHE WAS WARMED UP.

1113
00:56:00,666 --> 00:56:02,300
YOU COULD HAVE CRIPPLED
HER ALL OVER AGAIN.

1114
00:56:02,367 --> 00:56:04,100
NUMBER TWO, YOU DISOBEYED ME.

1115
00:56:04,166 --> 00:56:06,100
NUMBER THREE, YOU
SCARED YOUR MOM.

1116
00:56:06,166 --> 00:56:09,433
NOW, I THINK YOU GOT IN
APOLOGIES TO MAKE HERE.

1117
00:56:14,400 --> 00:56:16,100
- I'M SORRY, MOM.

1118
00:56:16,166 --> 00:56:19,367
I'M SORRY, BEN.

1119
00:56:19,433 --> 00:56:21,367
AND I'M REALLY,
REALLY SORRY, GINGER.

1120
00:56:21,433 --> 00:56:24,066
I DIDN'T MEAN TO
HURT YOU, HONEST.

1121
00:56:24,133 --> 00:56:26,300
- YEAH, WELL, JUST SO YOU
DON'T FORGET, I WANT YOU TO

1122
00:56:26,367 --> 00:56:28,133
TAKE GINGER AND WALK HER
AROUND THIS ARENA FOR ONE

1123
00:56:28,200 --> 00:56:29,999
HOUR, YOU UNDERSTAND?

1124
00:56:30,066 --> 00:56:31,533
- YES, SIR.

1125
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:32,999
- ALL RIGHT.

1126
00:56:33,066 --> 00:56:36,033
GET TO IT.

1127
00:56:39,433 --> 00:56:40,733
- A LITTLE ROUGH
ON HER, WEREN'T YOU?

1128
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:42,066
- YOU EVER BEEN
UP ON A HORSE?

1129
00:56:42,133 --> 00:56:43,599
- THEN YOU STICK WITH THE
DOCTORING, AND I'LL

1130
00:56:43,666 --> 00:56:45,632
HANDLE THE RIDING.

1131
00:56:47,033 --> 00:56:48,632
- BEN?

1132
00:56:48,699 --> 00:56:51,233
SHE DID REALLY WELL
OUT THERE, DIDN'T SHE?

1133
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:52,966
- BUDDY, YOU EVER SEEN
ANYONE RIDE LIKE THAT FIRST

1134
00:56:53,033 --> 00:56:55,066
TIME OUT OF THE BOX?

1135
00:56:55,133 --> 00:56:57,899
- NOT IN 65 YEARS
OF RIDING HORSES.

1136
00:56:57,966 --> 00:57:00,233
- SHE DID DARN GOOD.

1137
00:57:02,866 --> 00:57:05,066
- COME ON, MELINDA,
GET OUT THERE, HONEY!

1138
00:57:05,133 --> 00:57:10,100
ATTA GIRL.

1139
00:57:16,467 --> 00:57:17,966
- HOW'S MELINDA
DOING, DALLAS?

1140
00:57:18,033 --> 00:57:20,300
- SHE'S GETTING THERE.

1141
00:57:20,367 --> 00:57:24,266
- COME ON!

1142
00:57:25,833 --> 00:57:29,400
- GOOD FOR WHAT AILS YOU.

1143
00:57:29,467 --> 00:57:30,999
WHAT'S THIS I HEAR ABOUT
YOU'RE FIRING BEN.

1144
00:57:31,066 --> 00:57:32,333
- WHO TOLD YOU?

1145
00:57:32,400 --> 00:57:34,233
- NOTHING'S SECRET
AROUND HERE, DARLING.

1146
00:57:34,300 --> 00:57:36,233
I THINK GETTING RID
OF BEN IS A MISTAKE.

1147
00:57:36,300 --> 00:57:37,966
- AND WHY IS THAT?

1148
00:57:38,033 --> 00:57:42,133
- BECAUSE BEN WILL STAND UP
TO YOU, AND JOHNNY WON'T.

1149
00:57:42,200 --> 00:57:44,567
- NOW DRIVE TO
THE BARREL, DRIVE!

1150
00:57:44,632 --> 00:57:46,266
- STAY DOWN IN THE SADDLE!

1151
00:57:46,333 --> 00:57:48,500
YOU WERE TOO HIGH
IN THE TURNS.

1152
00:57:48,567 --> 00:57:50,433
MELINDA'S GOING TO WIN THE
STATE CHAMPIONSHIP, YOU CAN

1153
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:51,933
BANK ON IT.

1154
00:57:51,999 --> 00:57:53,866
- I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

1155
00:57:53,933 --> 00:57:55,300
- GET OVER HERE, MELINDA.

1156
00:57:55,367 --> 00:57:56,632
- MORNING MR. HATHAWAY.

1157
00:57:56,699 --> 00:57:57,933
- HOWDY.

1158
00:57:57,999 --> 00:57:59,333
- NO MORE GOOFING OFF.

1159
00:57:59,400 --> 00:58:01,300
I WANT YOU OUT HERE SIX HOURS
A DAY AND I'M CANCELING

1160
00:58:01,367 --> 00:58:02,567
YOUR WEEK AT CAMP.

1161
00:58:02,632 --> 00:58:03,933
- BUT MOM, ALL OF
MY FRIENDS ARE GOING.

1162
00:58:03,999 --> 00:58:05,467
- USE YOUR HEAD, MELINDA.

1163
00:58:05,533 --> 00:58:09,766
NOW DO YOU WANT TO GO TO CAMP
OR BE A STATE CHAMPION, HUH?

1164
00:58:13,567 --> 00:58:16,599
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S TRY SOME
BIG CIRCLES, NICE AND WIDE.

1165
00:58:16,666 --> 00:58:19,433
KEEP THE HEELS DOWN.

1166
00:58:19,500 --> 00:58:21,733
HEELS DOWN, SUNNY.

1167
00:58:21,799 --> 00:58:27,166
GOOD, GOOD GRIP ON THE REINS.

1168
00:58:27,233 --> 00:58:29,166
JUST RELAX INTO THE
POSTING, JUST RELAX.

1169
00:58:29,233 --> 00:58:32,599
GOOD.

1170
00:58:32,666 --> 00:58:36,699
WELL, YOU'RE LOOKING
PRETTY DARN GOOD.

1171
00:58:36,766 --> 00:58:39,467
I TELL YOU WHAT, I'LL GO
AHEAD AND SET OUT THE

1172
00:58:39,533 --> 00:58:41,066
BARRELS.

1173
00:58:41,133 --> 00:58:42,766
YOU TROT GINGER THROUGH
FIVE TIMES AT A

1174
00:58:42,833 --> 00:58:44,433
TROT, YOU UNDERSTAND?

1175
00:58:44,500 --> 00:58:46,899
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

1176
00:58:53,699 --> 00:58:55,899
- HI.
- HI.

1177
00:58:55,966 --> 00:58:57,400
- BEN'S TEACHING ME TO RIDE.

1178
00:58:57,467 --> 00:58:58,999
- GATES ARE HARD.

1179
00:58:59,066 --> 00:59:01,699
POKEY DOESN'T LIKE TO DO
ANYTHING BUT WALK AND RUN.

1180
00:59:01,766 --> 00:59:03,899
ESPECIALLY COMING
BACK TO THE CORRAL.

1181
00:59:03,966 --> 00:59:05,899
- GINGER DON'T LIKE TO TROT.

1182
00:59:05,966 --> 00:59:07,966
- YOU GONNA ENTER THE
GYMKHANA SATURDAY?

1183
00:59:08,033 --> 00:59:09,533
IT'S ONLY A PRACTICE ONE.

1184
00:59:09,599 --> 00:59:11,300
- I DON'T THINK
I'M GOOD ENOUGH.

1185
00:59:11,367 --> 00:59:12,999
- YOU LOOK GOOD
ENOUGH TO ME.

1186
00:59:13,066 --> 00:59:15,833
THEY LET ANYONE ENTER,
EVEN ME AND POKEY.

1187
00:59:15,899 --> 00:59:20,033
- BEN, CAN I RIDE IN
THE GYMKHANA SATURDAY?

1188
00:59:20,100 --> 00:59:22,433
- WELL, I DON'T KNOW,
YOU WANT TO RIDE?

1189
00:59:22,500 --> 00:59:24,699
- SUSAN ASKED ME TO.

1190
00:59:24,766 --> 00:59:26,500
- WELL, IT'S FINE BY ME,
BUT YOU BETTER ASK YOUR MOM.

1191
00:59:26,567 --> 00:59:28,799
- OKAY.

1192
00:59:28,866 --> 00:59:30,899
- COOL. I GOTTA
GO, OKAY, BYE.

1193
00:59:30,966 --> 00:59:33,200
- BYE.

1194
00:59:35,066 --> 00:59:38,133
- SUNNY...

1195
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:40,033
WHOA, GINGER.

1196
00:59:40,100 --> 00:59:43,166
ALL RIGHT, NOW, I WANT YOU TO
RUN THE BARRELS

1197
00:59:43,233 --> 00:59:44,666
FIVE TIMES AT A...

1198
00:59:44,733 --> 00:59:46,333
- A TROT.

1199
00:59:46,400 --> 00:59:48,200
- AT A TROT, VERY GOOD.

1200
00:59:48,266 --> 00:59:49,567
AND THEN COOL HER DOWN
AND BRUSH HER OUT.

1201
00:59:49,632 --> 00:59:51,133
- YES, SIR, COACH.

1202
00:59:51,200 --> 00:59:52,866
- GET TO WORK, KID.

1203
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:55,933
- ANNOUNCER: FOLKS, BEN AND I
REALLY APPRECIATE THE

1204
00:59:55,999 --> 00:59:57,400
TURN OUT TODAY.

1205
00:59:57,467 --> 00:59:59,567
NOW, WE HOPE YOU'RE ALL
HAVING A GREAT TIME.

01:07:55,033 --> 01:07:59,533
DID A HECK OF A
JOB ON GINGER.

1375
01:07:59,600 --> 01:08:01,100
- THAT'S GOOD TO HEAR.

1376
01:08:01,166 --> 01:08:04,467
- I'LL TELL YOU WHAT, YOU
STOP BY ANY FRIDAY AND

1377
01:08:04,533 --> 01:08:08,433
WATCH GINGER RUN THOSE
BARRELS, HUH?

1378
01:08:08,500 --> 01:08:10,733
- I'LL TAKE YOU UP
ON THAT, ALL RIGHT.

1379
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:14,500
- THANKS AGAIN.

1380
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,567
- 16.3, NOT BAD, MELINDA.

1381
01:08:25,632 --> 01:08:26,866
- BUT IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

1382
01:08:26,933 --> 01:08:28,966
YESTERDAY, SUNNY RODE A 16.1.

1383
01:08:29,033 --> 01:08:31,699
- MELINDA, WHY
DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

1384
01:08:31,766 --> 01:08:33,533
- YOU'RE THE ONE THAT SAID
BEN WASN'T TEACHING ME RIGHT.

1385
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:41,367
- STAY ON THAT HORSE,
YOU'RE NOT FINISHED.

1386
01:08:41,433 --> 01:08:44,333
GO ON.

1387
01:08:46,233 --> 01:08:47,833
- I RODE A 15.9 YESTERDAY.

1388
01:08:47,899 --> 01:08:49,400
- WOW, THAT'S FAST.

1389
01:08:49,467 --> 01:08:50,733
- SUPER FAST.

1390
01:08:50,799 --> 01:08:53,600
- WATCH THIS, YAH!

1391
01:08:53,666 --> 01:08:55,799
COME ON, STEEL, LET'S GO!

1392

OH, STEEL, LET'S GO, COME ON!

1394
01:09:03,733 --> 01:09:05,266
- DID YOU SEE THAT?

1395
01:09:05,333 --> 01:09:06,733
STEEL'S DOGGING IT.

1396
01:09:06,799 --> 01:09:08,766
SHOULDN'T YOU WARM HIM UP A
LITTLE BEFORE YOU RUN HIM?

1397
01:09:08,833 --> 01:09:11,300
BEN SAID YOU CAN CRIPPLE A
HORSE BY RUNNING HIM COLD.

1398
01:09:11,367 --> 01:09:15,833
- NO, STEEL'S A
CHAMPION, WATCH THIS.

1399
01:09:15,899 --> 01:09:19,567
COME ON, STEEL,
COME ON, LET'S GO!

1400
01:09:19,632 --> 01:09:21,899

01:09:39,766 --> 01:09:41,033
THAT WAS MY BEST TIME YET AND
STEEL WASN'T EVEN

1407
01:09:41,100 --> 01:09:42,467
GOING ALL OUT.

1408
01:09:42,533 --> 01:09:43,999
WE'LL BE READY FOR REGIONALS.

1409
01:09:44,066 --> 01:09:45,400
- REGIONALS?

1410
01:09:45,467 --> 01:09:47,333
- THE REGIONAL
RODEO CHAMPIONSHIP.

1411
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,400
SUNNY, YOU SHOULD ENTER, BUT
YOU GOTTA HAVE THE

1412
01:09:49,467 --> 01:09:51,766
ENTRY FEE IN BY FRIDAY.

1413
01:09:51,833 --> 01:09:54,300
- I NEED TO.

1414
01:09:54,367 --> 01:09:57,133
I MEAN I WANT TO.

1415
01:09:57,200 --> 01:09:58,966
I MEAN, HOW MUCH IS IT?

1416
01:09:59,033 --> 01:10:00,533
- A HUNDRED DOLLARS.

1417
01:10:00,600 --> 01:10:01,966
COME ON, STEEL.

1418
01:10:02,033 --> 01:10:04,467
HIYA!

1419
01:10:04,533 --> 01:10:06,433
- I HAVE TO BEAT HER AT THE
REGIONAL RODEO, OR I DON'T

1420
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:07,966
GO TO STATE, RIGHT?

1421
01:10:08,033 --> 01:10:10,632
- NO, THE TWO FASTEST
REGIONAL RIDERS GO TO STAY,

1422
01:10:10,699 --> 01:10:12,433
NOT JUST THE WINNER, WHY?

1423
01:10:12,500 --> 01:10:15,333
- I GOTTA WIN, I
GOTTA WIN THEM BOTH.

1424
01:10:18,833 --> 01:10:21,200
- MOM?

1425
01:10:21,266 --> 01:10:23,266
I NEED A HUNDRED DOLLARS.

1426
01:10:23,333 --> 01:10:24,733
- WHAT FOR?

1427
01:10:24,799 --> 01:10:27,200
- I HAVE TO RIDE IN THE
REGIONAL RODEO,

1428
01:10:27,266 --> 01:10:28,733
THE BARREL RACE.

1429
01:10:28,799 --> 01:10:30,933
- THAT'S NONSENSE, YOU'RE
NOT READY TO RIDE IN A RODEO.

1430
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:32,799
- I'M BETTER THAN EVERYONE,
BUT MELINDA,

1431
01:10:32,866 --> 01:10:34,966
EVEN BEN SAID SO.

1432
01:10:35,033 --> 01:10:36,899
- HONEY, THOSE GIRLS HAVE
BEEN RIDING FOR YEARS.

1433
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:38,766
DON'T YOU THINK YOU SHOULD
WAIT FOR A YEAR OR TWO?

1434
01:10:38,833 --> 01:10:42,467
- I HAVE TO RIDE THIS YEAR.

1435
01:10:42,533 --> 01:10:44,233
- HAVE YOU ASKED
BEN THINKS ABOUT IT?

1436
01:10:44,300 --> 01:10:48,000
- NO.

1437
01:10:48,066 --> 01:10:49,866
- SUNNY, THERE'S A BIG
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RIDING

1438
01:10:49,933 --> 01:10:53,033
GINGER UP AT BEN'S PLACE
AND RIDING IN A RODEO.

1439
01:10:53,100 --> 01:10:56,799
BESIDES, I DON'T THINK I CAN
SPARE A HUNDRED DOLLARS.

1440
01:10:56,866 --> 01:10:59,999
- IF I WIN, I GET $5,000.

1441
01:11:00,066 --> 01:11:03,600
I COULD PAY YOU BACK.

1442
01:11:04,833 --> 01:11:06,500

COME ON, GINGER, TIME

COME ON.

1451

WHAT IF I DON'T DO GOOD?

1452
01:11:35,433 --> 01:11:36,899

01:11:36,966 --> 01:11:38,699
YOU'RE GONNA DO GOOD.

1454

GINGER, SHE DOESN'T
LOOK WORRIED, DOES SHE?

1455
01:11:40,999 --> 01:11:45,066
NO, COME ON.

1456
01:11:46,699 --> 01:11:49,467
- SUNNY, DON'T DAWDLE
NOW, GET HER BRUSHED DOWN.

1457
01:11:49,533 --> 01:11:51,632
THERE YOU GO.

1458
01:11:51,699 --> 01:11:56,367
GET HER OVER THERE
AND GET HER WARMED UP.

1459
01:12:06,733 --> 01:12:10,400
- ANNOUNCER: THAT WAS SUSAN
ANDREWS, BETTER LUCK NEXT TIME.

1460
01:12:10,467 --> 01:12:13,733
OUR NEXT RIDER IS MISS
SUNNY MATTHEWS ON GINGER.

1461
01:12:13,799 --> 01:12:15,400

1462
01:12:15,467 --> 01:12:17,133
- YOU'LL GET 'EM
NEXT TIME, SUSAN.

1463
01:12:17,200 --> 01:12:19,133
- NOW REMEMBER, IF YOU LOSE
YOUR HAT, YOU LOSE POINTS.

1464
01:12:19,200 --> 01:12:21,433
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO OUT
THERE AND HAVE SOME FUN, HUH?

1465
01:12:21,500 --> 01:12:23,333
JUST ANOTHER PRACTICE
RUN AROUND THE BARRELS.

1466
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:25,699
GO AHEAD, GINGER.

1467

1511
01:14:32,233 --> 01:14:33,766

01:14:41,266 --> 01:14:42,632
- THANK YOU.

1517
01:14:42,699 --> 01:14:44,033
- MELINDA?
- I HAVE TO GO.

1518
01:14:44,100 --> 01:14:48,400
- BYE.
- BYE.

1519
01:14:54,266 --> 01:15:02,400
- COME ON, BOY.

1520
01:15:02,467 --> 01:15:03,766
- HOW ARE YOU, DALLAS?

1521
01:15:03,833 --> 01:15:05,233
- I'VE BEEN WORSE.

1522
01:15:05,300 --> 01:15:07,100
- MELINDA LOOKED
REAL GOOD TODAY.

1523
01:15:07,166 --> 01:15:09,066
- OH, SHE CAN DO BETTER.

1524
01:15:09,133 --> 01:15:11,066
- YOU KNOW, DALLAS, IF
MELINDA WON TEN MILLION

1525
01:15:11,133 --> 01:15:14,033
DOLLARS IN THE LOTTERY, YOU'D
COMPLAIN THAT IT WASN'T 20.

1526
01:15:14,100 --> 01:15:18,133
- JUST SHOW ME THE TEN
MILLION, AND WE'LL SEE.

1527
01:15:18,200 --> 01:15:21,467
- I'M ROOTING FOR MELINDA,
BUT SUNNY LOOKED GOOD OUT

1528
01:15:21,533 --> 01:15:25,233
THERE, CONSIDERING SHE AIN'T
BEEN RIDING THAT LONG.

1529
01:15:25,300 --> 01:15:27,400
- YOU SAW WHO WON THAT,
JOHN, AND THAT'S

1530
01:15:27,467 --> 01:15:29,833
THE BOTTOM LINE.

1531
01:15:29,899 --> 01:15:31,699
- CAN'T ARGUE WITH YOU.

1532
01:15:41,699 --> 01:15:43,033
- YOU'RE UP EARLY.

1533
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:46,133
- GOOD MORNING.

1534
01:15:46,200 --> 01:15:48,300
BEN?

1535
01:15:48,367 --> 01:15:49,966
- HUH.

1536
01:15:50,033 --> 01:15:51,467
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1537
01:15:51,533 --> 01:15:53,533
IS STEEL FASTER THAN GINGER?

1538
01:15:53,600 --> 01:15:55,266
- NOT BY A LONG SHOT.

1539
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:57,966
GINGER CAN'T RUN FULL OUT
IF YOU'RE MAKING MISTAKES.

1540
01:15:58,033 --> 01:15:59,467
- WHAT DID I DO WRONG?

1541
01:15:59,533 --> 01:16:01,300
- WELL, YOU WERE FINE UP
UNTIL THAT LAST BARREL, BUT

SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT IT TAKES

1854
01:35:40,799 --> 01:35:44,799
TO BE A WINNER, BUT I
DIDN'T KNOW ANYTHING.

THE LITTLE I KNOW NOW I
JUST LEARNED FROM YOU.

1856
01:35:49,433 --> 01:35:52,300

01:35:59,766 --> 01:36:05,066
- I'M PROUD OF YOU,
TOO, AND YOU, TOO.

1862
01:36:06,833 --> 01:36:08,699

1863
01:36:08,766 --> 01:36:11,033
THERE'S NOTHING
BROKEN DOWN ABOUT YOU.

1864
01:36:11,100 --> 01:36:14,500
- NO, NO, SHE DID
IT ALL BY HERSELF.

1865
01:36:14,567 --> 01:36:17,300
- YOU TAUGHT HER.

1866
01:36:17,367 --> 01:36:19,966
WE WERE BETTER FRIENDS THAN
WE WERE HUSBAND AND WIFE,

1867
01:36:20,033 --> 01:36:22,100
WEREN'T WE, BEN?

1868
01:36:22,166 --> 01:36:24,633
MAYBE IF IT HAD BEEN THE
OTHER WAY AROUND, WE WOULDN'T

1869
01:36:24,699 --> 01:36:28,400
HAVE FALLEN APART
WHEN SHERRY DIED.

1870
01:36:28,467 --> 01:36:31,367
- MAYBE.

1871
01:36:31,433 --> 01:36:36,333
- STILL FRIENDS?

1872

- GO.

1877
01:36:52,567 --> 01:36:53,966
- HOW MANY TIMES HAS BEN
TOLD YOU NOT TO RUN

1878
01:36:54,033 --> 01:36:55,899
UNTIL YOU WARMED UP.

1879
01:36:55,966 --> 01:36:57,433
- BUT DALLAS...

1880
01:36:57,500 --> 01:36:59,133
- I HIRE THE BEST HORSEMAN
IN THE COUNTRY,

1881
01:36:59,200 --> 01:37:00,633
AND YOU DON'T LISTEN!

1882
01:37:00,699 --> 01:37:03,066
- OH, GRANDMA.

1883
01:37:05,367 --> 01:37:09,866
- SUNNY, COME HERE, I
GOT SOMETHING FOR YOU.

1884
01:37:12,866 --> 01:37:16,300
THESE ARE YOURS NOW.

1885
01:37:16,367 --> 01:37:19,533
WHEN YOU'RE OLD ENOUGH,
YOU CAN WEAR THEM.

1886
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:24,833
WHAT YOU DID TODAY, IT TOOK
A SPECIAL KIND OF PERSON.

1887
01:37:24,899 --> 01:37:29,533
YOU'VE EARNED THEM.

1888
01:37:29,600 --> 01:37:31,200
- SWEETHEART,
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

1889
01:37:31,266 --> 01:37:36,033
- THANK YOU.

1890
01:37:37,600 --> 01:37:39,533
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

1891
01:37:39,600 --> 01:37:40,999
HERE, KEEP THEM ALL WRAPPED
UP AND TAKE GOOD

1892
01:37:41,066 --> 01:37:43,666
CARE OF THEM.

1893
01:37:43,733 --> 01:37:45,600
GO PUT THEM AWAY
WHILE YOU'RE AT IT.

1894
01:37:45,666 --> 01:37:47,200
AND I'LL PUT GINGER AWAY.

1895
01:37:47,266 --> 01:37:51,500
- LET'S LOAD HER UP, HUH?

1896
01:37:51,567 --> 01:37:54,333
- COME ON, YES, COME ON.

1897

COME ON, GINGER.

1898
01:37:55,999 --> 01:37:59,600
- THAT WAS A REALLY
NICE THING YOU JUST DID.

1899
01:37:59,666 --> 01:38:00,899
- IT'S BEEN A WILD
DAY, HASN'T IT?

1900
01:38:00,966 --> 01:38:08,200
- YEAH, AND THEN SOME.

1901

DR. OLSON ASKED
ME TO MARRY HIM.

1903
01:38:14,933 --> 01:38:17,699
- YEAH?

1904
01:38:17,766 --> 01:38:20,467

PROBLEMS, THOUGH.

1905
01:38:20,533 --> 01:38:24,300
- YEAH?

1906
01:38:24,367 --> 01:38:28,066
[LAUGHING]

1907
01:38:28,133 --> 01:38:30,766
- A...

1908
01:38:30,833 --> 01:38:34,567
I DON'T LOVE HIM.

1909
01:38:34,633 --> 01:38:37,433
B...

I THINK I FOUND SOMEBODY
I MIGHT LIKE BETTER.

1914
01:38:48,933 --> 01:38:50,933

1915
01:38:51,000 --> 01:38:58,033
- MAYBE.

WHAT DO YOU THINK?

1917
01:39:00,133 --> 01:39:05,333
