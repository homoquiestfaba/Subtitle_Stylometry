1
00:00:11,011 --> 00:00:14,106
I don't think any of us had any
clue it was gonna go this long.

2
00:00:17,718 --> 00:00:20,552
I saw the pilot and I
thought, "Oh, right, great.

3
00:00:20,721 --> 00:00:21,882
Oh, my God."

4
00:00:23,590 --> 00:00:26,424
Nobody really knew.
Nobody had a clue, you know.

5
00:00:26,593 --> 00:00:29,427
We did the first episode
and it was fun, but...

6
00:00:29,897 --> 00:00:31,897
I remember when I saw
the pilot for the first time,

7
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:34,261
and I thought, "Well,
that's kind of okay.

8
00:00:34,434 --> 00:00:36,034
I don't know if it's
gonna get picked up.

9
00:00:36,203 --> 00:00:37,883
I should probably go
and find another job."

10
00:00:42,342 --> 00:00:44,140
It was a pretty
unanimous consensus

11
00:00:44,311 --> 00:00:46,803
that I'd be looking for
another job real soon.

12
00:00:47,014 --> 00:00:49,540
Well, it's okay, because
I can be a waitress.

13
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:55,251
I was supposed
to do eight shows.

14
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:02,621
It was funny because
when the show started,

15
00:01:02,796 --> 00:01:05,265
I was about to turn 17

16
00:01:05,432 --> 00:01:07,025
and I was gonna
go off to college.

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,066
And I remember when
the show got picked up,

18
00:01:09,236 --> 00:01:10,431
I deferred a year, thinking:

19
00:01:10,604 --> 00:01:12,698
"Oh, you know what?
It's never gonna go.

20
00:01:12,873 --> 00:01:14,068
Who makes teen dramas?"

21
00:01:14,241 --> 00:01:16,608
You know, "That's not gonna
last. No one wants to see that."

22
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:18,810
And then it turned into
weeks and months and months

23
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:22,416
and years and years and
years, and here we are.

24
00:01:22,616 --> 00:01:25,780
I'm obviously not going back to
college, but who would have thunk it?

25
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:27,445
ANNOUNCER: <i>Tonight:</i>

26
00:01:27,654 --> 00:01:31,887
(ANNOUNCER READS ON-SCREEN TEXT)

27
00:02:04,992 --> 00:02:06,460
It's kind of scary,

28
00:02:06,627 --> 00:02:09,187
first time I've been
on a big sound stage.

29
00:02:09,363 --> 00:02:11,389
Here I was embarking on a show

30
00:02:11,565 --> 00:02:14,797
that would inevitably
be globally successful.

31
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:16,231
Kind of scary.

32
00:02:16,703 --> 00:02:18,638
(CHUCKLES)

33
00:02:18,839 --> 00:02:21,707
You don't know whether it's actually
gonna get picked up, let alone,

34
00:02:21,875 --> 00:02:24,674
do you think it's gonna be a
series that's gonna run for ten years.

35
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,847
I just remember hoping
that everyone liked me

36
00:02:27,014 --> 00:02:28,482
and that we all got along.

37
00:02:28,682 --> 00:02:31,277
- You know her?
- Yeah, I know her.

38
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:33,252
DAVID: She's hot.

39
00:02:33,453 --> 00:02:36,423
She is the biggest bitch
at West Beverly High.

40
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:38,286
I had no idea what
to expect though.

41
00:02:38,458 --> 00:02:42,327
I had never done anything like this
with a group of my peers this large,

42
00:02:42,496 --> 00:02:46,058
so I was very nervous, actually.

43
00:02:46,266 --> 00:02:48,906
I remember seeing Luke, because I
knew him in New York, and saying:

44
00:02:49,069 --> 00:02:50,229
"Oh, man, hi. How you doing?"

45
00:02:50,337 --> 00:02:54,138
And he said, "Oh, Gabrielle."
He said, "Man, I'm so nervous."

46
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,833
And he said, "You know,
I hope this goes on."

47
00:02:57,044 --> 00:02:59,912
I was really nervous because
I felt kind of apart from them.

48
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:01,680
That I was kind of
just thrust into this,

49
00:03:01,782 --> 00:03:04,411
and they were kind of looking
at me weird because of my dad.

50
00:03:04,584 --> 00:03:06,712
Girls... It's the nature
of them to do this.

51
00:03:06,887 --> 00:03:09,254
They sort of form
little cliques and clubs

52
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:12,860
and they get mad at each other
about little things back and forth.

53
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:16,030
Oh, yeah, there
was vicious cliques.

54
00:03:16,196 --> 00:03:17,196
Yeah.

55
00:03:17,364 --> 00:03:19,724
There are only so many red
dresses you can have in one shot.

56
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:20,925
I mean, come on.

57
00:03:21,101 --> 00:03:22,535
We were all pretty
much the same age

58
00:03:22,703 --> 00:03:26,140
or at least lying that we
were the same age. Ha-ha-ha.

59
00:03:26,306 --> 00:03:29,242
And we spent a
lot of time together.

60
00:03:29,443 --> 00:03:31,378
We were all very
friendly, right off the bat.

61
00:03:31,578 --> 00:03:34,446
Tori is like my little sister
and that just sort of happened.

62
00:03:34,648 --> 00:03:37,379
Brian and I bonded instantly
because we were the same age.

63
00:03:37,584 --> 00:03:38,677
Well, you know, occas...

64
00:03:38,852 --> 00:03:41,913
There were occasional groupings
here and there, that's for sure.

65
00:03:42,122 --> 00:03:43,613
It was the girls
against the boys.

66
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:47,158
We had a torrid love affair, me
and Jennie, for quite some time.

67
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:50,354
It just ended, actually,
because her boyfriend found out.

68
00:03:50,530 --> 00:03:52,795
Anyways... No, I'm kidding.

69
00:03:52,999 --> 00:03:54,467
We were all thrown
in this together,

70
00:03:54,634 --> 00:03:56,660
no one knowing
anybody really too well.

71
00:03:56,837 --> 00:04:00,672
And we all started to form
relationships, you know,

72
00:04:00,841 --> 00:04:03,208
that grew into family, really.

73
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,730
It was very hard
for me and Brian

74
00:04:04,845 --> 00:04:07,314
because we were in a
relationship when I started the show.

75
00:04:07,481 --> 00:04:08,881
You owe me.

76
00:04:09,416 --> 00:04:10,679
What did you have in mind?

77
00:04:10,884 --> 00:04:11,884
(CHUCKLES)

78
00:04:12,052 --> 00:04:13,953
I'll think of something.

79
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,947
No, not like that, David. David.

80
00:04:17,157 --> 00:04:21,891
My first impression
of Gabby was...

81
00:04:22,095 --> 00:04:26,294
I remember meeting her,
just going, "Yeah, yeah.

82
00:04:26,466 --> 00:04:27,627
(LAUGHS)

83
00:04:27,801 --> 00:04:31,033
You're Andrea, perfect.
Absolutely perfect."

84
00:04:31,204 --> 00:04:33,469
And I remember Jason
walking in, he was so late.

85
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:35,700
And I was like, "What
are you doing being late?

86
00:04:35,876 --> 00:04:38,744
This is, like, Aaron Spelling.
And this is his house, and this is..."

87
00:04:38,912 --> 00:04:40,039
I was like, "Oh, my God."

88
00:04:41,815 --> 00:04:45,081
There was this guy
named Priestley. Ha-ha-ha.

89
00:04:45,252 --> 00:04:46,276
I love him.

90
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:49,422
He's Brandon. To me he's
just Brandon, you know?

91
00:04:49,589 --> 00:04:54,357
I try to really always
see him as Brandon.

92
00:04:54,528 --> 00:04:56,793
Jason does not exist.

93
00:04:56,997 --> 00:04:58,260
Early on in the show,

94
00:04:58,431 --> 00:05:01,060
you know, no one was
really discussing their age.

95
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:05,103
Jay... Jay was the most elusive.
No one knew how old he was.

96
00:05:05,272 --> 00:05:08,071
- He was probably 16 years old.
- When I started the show, I was 21.

97
00:05:08,275 --> 00:05:09,800
But he acted like
he was 30 years old.

98
00:05:09,976 --> 00:05:12,707
Finally, one day, Shannen
comes running on set:

99
00:05:12,879 --> 00:05:15,041
"I know how old
you are. You're..."

100
00:05:15,248 --> 00:05:17,479
- Twenty-one.
- And Jay turned red.

101
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,711
"How do you...? How did
you know how old I am?

102
00:05:19,886 --> 00:05:20,886
How do you know that?"

103
00:05:21,054 --> 00:05:22,654
She's like, "I went
in your dressing room

104
00:05:22,823 --> 00:05:25,315
and I looked in your wallet
and I saw your license."

105
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:27,927
And Jay just about
threw her through the wall.

106
00:05:28,094 --> 00:05:30,393
That was quite an exciting day.

107
00:05:30,597 --> 00:05:36,503
Jason was always very
gracious and friendly to everyone.

108
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:37,831
And the crew loves him.

109
00:05:38,004 --> 00:05:39,302
Everyone loves Jason, you know.

110
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:42,203
He's... He's a good guy.

111
00:05:42,409 --> 00:05:45,675
I hung out with Jason the most
when we first started doing the show.

112
00:05:48,215 --> 00:05:49,215
Just...

113
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:51,102
I don't know if there
was any reason for it.

114
00:05:51,251 --> 00:05:54,346
We just kind of seemed to have
a lot in common and had fun.

115
00:05:54,521 --> 00:05:56,080
GARTH: And I'll
love him forever. He...

116
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:59,226
You know, I have a very special
place in my heart for Jason.

117
00:06:00,527 --> 00:06:01,551
(CHUCKLES)

118
00:06:01,728 --> 00:06:02,821
Thanks.

119
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:04,294
When I watched the pilot,

120
00:06:04,464 --> 00:06:07,832
the one big thing that just
kept resounding in my head was:

121
00:06:08,001 --> 00:06:09,629
"I really need to cut my hair."

122
00:06:11,838 --> 00:06:16,003
I just had a bad mullet,
man. Really bad salad going.

123
00:06:16,209 --> 00:06:19,771
But, you know, it was the time,
right? You know, it was the '80s.

124
00:06:19,980 --> 00:06:21,972
(INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

125
00:06:32,459 --> 00:06:33,791
- That's great.
- Do some more.

126
00:06:33,994 --> 00:06:35,826
(INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

127
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:41,268
I'd probably would have had a more
consistent hairstyle over the years.

128
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:42,629
(INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

129
00:06:44,704 --> 00:06:48,698
You know, that classic, like,
you know, hockey-player haircut.

130
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:52,842
And I would have
cut out the blond.

131
00:06:53,046 --> 00:06:54,810
It's not plastic
surgery, it's a hair color.

132
00:06:54,981 --> 00:06:57,644
If you don't like it,
you'll change it back.

133
00:06:57,851 --> 00:06:59,843
(INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

134
00:07:08,762 --> 00:07:12,893
There are, you know, a lot of
horrifying images that come up

135
00:07:13,066 --> 00:07:16,036
but I just block
those out and say:

136
00:07:16,202 --> 00:07:18,034
"I love it. I love it all."

137
00:07:18,204 --> 00:07:21,072
The kinds of comments I
get from my mother are like:

138
00:07:21,241 --> 00:07:22,607
"Lindsay, don't
flare your nostrils

139
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:25,769
because on our TV, they're
the size of tennis balls."

140
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:28,967
It was almost like
a weird dream,

141
00:07:29,082 --> 00:07:32,382
like I was watching
myself on something that I...

142
00:07:32,552 --> 00:07:34,282
I can't explain
it, just strange.

143
00:07:34,487 --> 00:07:36,251
My butt was really big.

144
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:38,357
And I thought, "Man,
I gotta work on that."

145
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,789
My wife says I have no ass.

146
00:07:41,695 --> 00:07:42,788
Really?

147
00:07:42,996 --> 00:07:45,989
You know, it was loose, you know,
pretty long, but then long in the back.

148
00:07:46,199 --> 00:07:48,159
I had that kind of hair
curtain going in the back.

149
00:07:48,301 --> 00:07:49,394
Scary.

150
00:07:49,602 --> 00:07:51,036
Oh, how embarrassing.

151
00:07:53,807 --> 00:07:56,072
(INAUDIBLE DIALOGUE)

152
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:07,243
Yeah, you hate your voice,
you hate your hair, everything.

153
00:08:07,420 --> 00:08:08,940
You just... You know,
you can't believe

154
00:08:09,022 --> 00:08:12,151
that's really what you
look and sound like, I think.

155
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:16,319
He just gets to me.
He always gets to me.

156
00:08:16,529 --> 00:08:20,193
We all did bad things
in the '80s, didn't we?

I didn't know it
involved manual labor.

170
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:08,614
(LAUGHS)

171
00:09:08,815 --> 00:09:12,582
It's a... A passage.

172
00:09:12,752 --> 00:09:15,483
SPELLING: Oh, I had a such a
crush on Brian when we first started.

173
00:09:15,655 --> 00:09:18,420
I thought he was so cute, and I
felt so proud to get to work with him.

174
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:19,991
And to have that
bond over the years

175
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:23,722
has really helped endear, I
think, our characters to each other.

176
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,765
He was the most in love with
the David and Donna storyline.

177
00:09:34,774 --> 00:09:36,800
You like your surprise?

178
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:40,469
GREEN: Because that was
like two people really growing.

179
00:09:40,947 --> 00:09:42,882
How did I get so lucky?

180
00:09:44,017 --> 00:09:45,986
You waited.

181
00:09:48,621 --> 00:09:50,852
Ultimately, I just...

182
00:09:52,025 --> 00:09:54,859
Just want her to be with
David and see where their...

183
00:09:55,028 --> 00:09:58,624
I wish I could see where their
lives go when the show ends.

184
00:10:13,113 --> 00:10:15,810
It's funny, you know, in the
nature of our program, there's...

185
00:10:15,982 --> 00:10:17,541
Because we swap spit a lot.

186
00:10:17,717 --> 00:10:20,312
And we jump around
on each other a good bit.

187
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,920
Hygiene is a real issue.

188
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:27,483
Can I make one
teeny-weeny suggestion?

189
00:10:27,660 --> 00:10:29,219
- What?
- Brush your teeth.

190
00:10:29,395 --> 00:10:31,421
(GIGGLES)

191
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:34,263
You really know how to kill a
romantic moment, don't you?

192
00:10:55,455 --> 00:10:58,152
A lot of deodorant gets used
on our set, a lot of mouthwash.

193
00:10:58,324 --> 00:11:04,389
We probably have one of the bigger
mouthwash budgets in Hollywood,

194
00:11:04,564 --> 00:11:05,964
I would guess.

195
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:09,864
I'm reading the script for the first
time and then there's, like, a kiss.

196
00:11:10,036 --> 00:11:12,198
Like, "Oh, my God. I
have to kiss Jennie."

197
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:14,772
I've been through so many
boyfriends on the show.

198
00:11:14,974 --> 00:11:18,467
And I really don't know her all that
well. I think it was, like, episode ten.

199
00:11:18,645 --> 00:11:21,308
And I was nervous, you know?

200
00:11:21,481 --> 00:11:22,949
So I said, "Jennie..." Ha-ha.

201
00:11:23,116 --> 00:11:26,917
(LAUGHING) Actually,
I said, "Come here."

202
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:30,615
I've never kissed more boys in
my life than I have on this show.

203
00:11:30,790 --> 00:11:32,520
That is a scary concept.

204
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:34,525
"What do you say we
break the ice a little bit

205
00:11:34,661 --> 00:11:37,028
just so we're comfortable
with this scene?"

206
00:11:37,197 --> 00:11:39,557
And she's like, "What do you
mean? You wanna run the lines?"

207
00:11:39,699 --> 00:11:41,861
I said, "Yeah,
something like that."

208
00:11:42,035 --> 00:11:44,266
I've gotten more
action on this show...

209
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:45,996
(LAUGHS)

210
00:11:46,206 --> 00:11:49,404
And so I pulled her
into the garage, I said...

211
00:11:49,609 --> 00:11:50,702
Give me some sugar, baby.

212
00:11:50,910 --> 00:11:52,879
And I kissed her
a couple of times.

213
00:11:53,046 --> 00:11:58,075
And it was purely
research, or so I thought.

214
00:11:58,284 --> 00:12:01,652
I walked away feeling much more
than research had been done. Ha-ha-ha.

215
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:05,217
ZIERING: It's got my name
on it. WOMAN: Is that you?

216
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,950
I got the clothes
when they got there.

217
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:08,423
(INDISTINCT CHATTER)

218
00:12:08,595 --> 00:12:12,657
Oh. Oh. There's a reason
you wear bike shorts for these.

219
00:12:19,172 --> 00:12:20,936
WOMAN: Oh, God,
is he gonna crash?

220
00:12:21,107 --> 00:12:23,406
ZIERING: Whoo! GARTH:
This is our sanctuary.

221
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:25,841
When we come here,
everything's okay, you know.

222
00:12:26,012 --> 00:12:27,878
And it feels better
to come to work

223
00:12:28,047 --> 00:12:29,687
because you're
surrounded by your friends,

224
00:12:29,816 --> 00:12:32,513
and people that love
you and support you.

225
00:12:32,685 --> 00:12:36,315
It's just a really
amazing environment.

226
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,219
(LAUGHS)

227
00:12:38,391 --> 00:12:39,391
MAN: Grow...

228
00:12:40,727 --> 00:12:42,787
GARTH: Our initial
audience was very broad.

229
00:12:42,996 --> 00:12:46,023
Parents were watching it with
their children, their young children.

230
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:47,999
Teenagers were watching
it with their friends.

231
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:50,181
College students were
watching it with their friends.

232
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:52,567
And over the ten years,
they've just kept watching it.

233
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:54,173
Then those people
who have grown up

234
00:12:54,340 --> 00:12:56,332
now have children of
their own that watch it.

235
00:12:56,542 --> 00:12:58,511
Now, we have a whole
new generation of people...

236
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:01,045
Young kids, like the
13-year-olds that missed us before

237
00:13:01,214 --> 00:13:03,206
are watching FX
now and catching up.

238
00:13:03,416 --> 00:13:05,408
I swear that's half the
reason we're still on,

239
00:13:05,585 --> 00:13:07,816
is that parents
started watching too.

240
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:10,081
It's... You know, I
know so many parents

241
00:13:10,256 --> 00:13:13,158
that are addicted to the
show just like their kids are.

242
00:13:13,359 --> 00:13:17,524
You know, it's just
this weird food chain

243
00:13:17,697 --> 00:13:19,029
that just kept going.

244
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:22,202
I mean, how many people
now who are, you know, 25?

245
00:13:22,368 --> 00:13:24,303
They started watching the
show when they were 15.

246
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,939
It was a big family show,
I mean, I... Everywhere...

247
00:13:27,106 --> 00:13:29,075
Every time I went and did
an appearance somewhere

248
00:13:29,242 --> 00:13:30,471
or talked to somebody else

249
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:33,943
and, you know, these people
would stand in line for hours

250
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:35,433
to get an autograph
or something.

251
00:13:35,581 --> 00:13:38,449
You get this daughter and her
mother who is just as excited

252
00:13:38,618 --> 00:13:41,110
to be up at the front of the
line as her daughter was.

253
00:13:41,287 --> 00:13:42,311
And they would...

254
00:13:42,488 --> 00:13:44,047
I heard that 90
percent of the time,

255
00:13:44,223 --> 00:13:46,419
that the whole family
would sit down and watch it.

256
00:13:46,592 --> 00:13:48,272
I think the biggest
thing that the show did

257
00:13:48,428 --> 00:13:52,126
was bring families back
together on certain levels

258
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:57,066
because, ahem, <i>90210</i> was definitely,
I think, one of the first young shows

259
00:13:57,236 --> 00:13:59,467
that dealt with
really serious issues.

260
00:13:59,672 --> 00:14:02,870
Everybody has the same problems.
Everyone has the same experiences.

261
00:14:03,042 --> 00:14:05,068
You know, the life
experiences of growing up

262
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:06,769
are the life experiences
of growing up.

263
00:14:06,946 --> 00:14:10,246
Eating disorders, drug
abuse, you know, relationships,

264
00:14:10,416 --> 00:14:12,044
you know, family
problems, whatever.

265
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:15,710
And we kind of just go with the
times and the issues that are current.

266
00:14:15,888 --> 00:14:21,520
I got a few letters after the
first drug-addiction storyline

267
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:23,424
that my character went through

268
00:14:23,596 --> 00:14:25,895
of, you know,
somebody that said,

269
00:14:26,065 --> 00:14:28,534
you know, that
I... That watching...

270
00:14:28,701 --> 00:14:31,830
Basically, watching me
do it made them realize

271
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,905
how ridiculous it was
what they were doing

272
00:14:34,073 --> 00:14:35,097
and they stopped.

273
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:38,335
I was proud when we dealt
with issues that were really...

274
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:41,003
You know, that affect all of us.

275
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:44,150
You know, you do a show
just hoping to entertain people.

276
00:14:44,317 --> 00:14:47,685
And when your show can make
a difference in one person's life

277
00:14:47,854 --> 00:14:49,015
it's pretty huge.

278
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,462
Kids could relate, be able
to open up with their parents,

279
00:14:51,657 --> 00:14:54,491
be able to talk about these
issues that they're seeing on TV.

280
00:14:54,660 --> 00:14:57,061
GREEN: I think the show
opened doors for parents

281
00:14:57,230 --> 00:15:00,428
to communicate with their kids that
they didn't have before, you know?

282
00:15:00,633 --> 00:15:02,795
If you say that kids
don't need condoms

283
00:15:02,969 --> 00:15:05,564
because they shouldn't be
having sex in the first place,

284
00:15:05,738 --> 00:15:08,071
well, you're overlooking
two very important things.

285
00:15:08,274 --> 00:15:11,073
One is that a lot of
kids are having sex.

286
00:15:11,244 --> 00:15:13,008
And the other is
that they are kids.

287
00:15:13,212 --> 00:15:14,976
It's so easy to look
at your own problems

288
00:15:15,148 --> 00:15:17,748
and think that you're the only
one that's going through something,

289
00:15:17,850 --> 00:15:22,811
and all the pain that you're feeling
in life or something going on is...

290
00:15:22,989 --> 00:15:23,989
You're alone.

291
00:15:24,157 --> 00:15:25,625
And, I think, to watch a show

292
00:15:25,792 --> 00:15:29,490
and see other people,
you know, your age

293
00:15:29,662 --> 00:15:32,598
going through the same things
kind of takes the pain out of it.

294
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:38,102
I'd like the show to be remembered
as an issue-oriented program.

295
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:41,867
One that touched a lot of
people in a positive way,

296
00:15:42,041 --> 00:15:45,443
not just here in this country
but all over the world.

297
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,706
And then I'd like it to be
remembered as <i>The Ian Ziering Show.</i>

298
00:15:48,881 --> 00:15:51,248
Yes, ladies and
gentlemen. Ha-ha-ha.

299
00:15:53,019 --> 00:15:54,920
ZIERING: Ten years of <i>90210.</i>

300
00:15:55,488 --> 00:15:58,583
And don't I look
good? Ha-ha-ha. Yeah.

301
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,692
If Ian's on the set, you're
always gonna laugh.

302
00:16:00,860 --> 00:16:02,761
When he comes up with
that number-two grin...

303
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,328
(LAUGHS)

304
00:16:04,530 --> 00:16:07,762
Ian on caffeine is
something out of this world.

305
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,764
- Shaah!
- Ian's off the wall.

306
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:14,566
I've seen him actually go from standing
position on the ground, in this office,

307
00:16:14,740 --> 00:16:17,835
and leap onto the desk
in, like, one single jump.

308
00:16:18,044 --> 00:16:19,740
I was amazed by his hair,

309
00:16:19,946 --> 00:16:24,042
because I had never seen a big
white Afro like that ever in my life.

310
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:25,479
Ian, you're so bad.

311
00:16:25,751 --> 00:16:27,219
(GROWLS THEN LAUGHS)

312
00:16:27,420 --> 00:16:29,787
Ian would do anything
to make everybody laugh.

313
00:16:29,956 --> 00:16:31,686
I have done things,

314
00:16:32,158 --> 00:16:33,319
(CHUCKLES)

315
00:16:33,493 --> 00:16:35,587
some things that I
am not too proud of.

316
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:37,990
(LAUGHS)

317
00:16:38,197 --> 00:16:39,221
Ahem. Check, please.

318
00:16:39,398 --> 00:16:42,300
Ian Ziering has a lot of
Steve qualities in him.

319
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:43,697
He's a pretty funny guy.

320
00:16:44,203 --> 00:16:46,900
Oh. What would I change?

321
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:52,204
I'd change Ian's socks.

322
00:16:52,712 --> 00:16:55,011
Here's my buddy.
He'll drive me home.

323
00:16:55,882 --> 00:16:58,147
- Hey, buddy.
- I can't...

324
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:00,786
- This is my car.
- Oh, my God.

325
00:17:00,953 --> 00:17:01,953
GREEN: Ian's my brother.

326
00:17:02,121 --> 00:17:06,957
Ian is my older brother and
he will be for the rest of my life.

327
00:17:07,126 --> 00:17:11,564
And if I had to go home
the day after we wrap here

328
00:17:11,731 --> 00:17:16,294
and know in my mind that I
wasn't real and honest with him

329
00:17:16,469 --> 00:17:20,600
and he didn't get
100 percent of myself,

330
00:17:21,741 --> 00:17:27,647
that would be possibly one
of the biggest letdowns for me.

331
00:17:28,381 --> 00:17:30,213
Thanks a lot, buddy.

332
00:17:30,683 --> 00:17:33,084
I'm gonna remember you for this.

333
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:34,810
(LAUGHS)

334
00:17:36,255 --> 00:17:40,158
ANNOUNCER: <i>Coming up,
Luke Perry's tips on lovemaking.</i>

335
00:17:40,359 --> 00:17:41,418
I remember him teaching me

336
00:17:41,594 --> 00:17:47,932
that it's a much better,
like, sexier, sensual kiss

337
00:17:48,100 --> 00:17:51,593
if you drink really, really hot
water before, like, your love scenes

338
00:17:51,771 --> 00:17:54,502
and, like, when you're
making out with somebody.

339
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:56,735
I was always like,
"Let it happen to me.

340
00:17:56,909 --> 00:17:59,435
Let something really bad
actually happen to the character."

341
00:17:59,612 --> 00:18:03,640
So they did. They shot her,
they burned her, raped her.

342
00:18:03,849 --> 00:18:05,545
They really took me seriously.

343
00:18:05,751 --> 00:18:09,210
ANNOUNCER: <i>Jason talks about
what he doesn't miss at</i> 90210.

344
00:18:09,422 --> 00:18:13,484
We ate the worst food
every day, without fail.

345
00:18:13,659 --> 00:18:15,355
I do not miss lunch.

346
00:18:15,828 --> 00:18:18,161
ANNOUNCER: <i>And the cast
takes home some souvenirs.</i>

347
00:18:18,331 --> 00:18:20,596
- You think I'm kidding,
don't you? MAN: Take it...

348
00:18:20,800 --> 00:18:26,205
ANNOUNCER: <i>All when</i> Beverly
Hills, 90210: The Final Goodbye <i>returns.</i>

349
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,107
Make sure nobody
notices. What's up?

350
00:18:35,281 --> 00:18:36,841
See any souvenirs
you'd like here, Luke?

351
00:18:38,184 --> 00:18:39,184
Any souvenir?

352
00:18:39,352 --> 00:18:41,719
I like that Panavision camera.
I'd like to take that home.

353
00:18:41,887 --> 00:18:45,847
No, no, no, that's gotta stay.

354
00:18:46,025 --> 00:18:47,459
There's a reason for that.

355
00:18:48,027 --> 00:18:50,258
Next roll, please.

356
00:18:50,429 --> 00:18:52,549
PERRY: Everybody on this
crew can read me like a book.

357
00:18:52,698 --> 00:18:54,997
I don't hide anything from
these people. I don't have to.

358
00:18:55,201 --> 00:18:59,104
You wanna keep stuff from
them and you can't, a lot of times.

359
00:18:59,305 --> 00:19:01,740
And that's just something
that each and every one of them

360
00:19:01,907 --> 00:19:03,773
has earned that trust with me.

361
00:19:03,943 --> 00:19:05,571
And, hopefully, I
have with them.

362
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:07,338
You're a superhero to me, pal.

363
00:19:07,513 --> 00:19:09,072
I should wear a
medallion that says:

364
00:19:09,248 --> 00:19:10,944
"Ode to Dylan,"
because you're the man.

365
00:19:11,117 --> 00:19:14,019
- I always thought
so. MAN: Cut. Good.

366
00:19:14,220 --> 00:19:16,086
Thank you and good
night to the Peach Pit,

367
00:19:16,255 --> 00:19:17,382
ladies and gentlemen.

368
00:19:17,556 --> 00:19:21,118
- Thank you.
- That's a wrap on this set.

369
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:25,161
PERRY: It's only here towards the
end of it when we start doing these things

370
00:19:25,331 --> 00:19:26,856
and there's a lot of
news crews around,

371
00:19:27,033 --> 00:19:30,970
that you really have to stop and
think about the things that you say.

372
00:19:31,137 --> 00:19:33,097
- Here you go.
- You think I'm kidding, don't you?

373
00:19:33,205 --> 00:19:35,265
MAN: Take it... WOMAN:
That's the first time...

374
00:19:35,441 --> 00:19:37,774
Who is that?

375
00:19:38,978 --> 00:19:41,538
PERRY: The rest of the time,
it's pretty much a big free-for-all.

376
00:19:41,681 --> 00:19:45,448
They'll never come...
They'll never know.

377
00:19:45,651 --> 00:19:47,677
Because it's very safe.

378
00:19:48,654 --> 00:19:51,021
ZIERING: Luke
hasn't changed one bit.

379
00:19:51,557 --> 00:19:55,494
He is the same country
bumpkin that he has always been.

380
00:19:55,695 --> 00:19:57,254
My first year with Luke was...

381
00:19:57,430 --> 00:19:59,831
I remember my very first
love scene was with him.

382
00:20:00,266 --> 00:20:03,998
And I remember him
taking his shirt off, going:

383
00:20:04,170 --> 00:20:06,696
"Okay, that's not possible.
He's thinner than I am.

384
00:20:06,872 --> 00:20:10,365
He's got a tinier waist
than me. That's not right."

385
00:20:10,576 --> 00:20:12,010
Luke's really a hillbilly.

386
00:20:12,178 --> 00:20:14,841
I mean, he'll never admit
it but I know the true Luke.

387
00:20:15,047 --> 00:20:16,047
Luke and I would...

388
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:19,811
Whenever we had scenes
together we would strip naked

389
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:22,454
while we were doing the
scene with the other person.

390
00:20:22,621 --> 00:20:24,681
The person who was off
camera would strip naked,

391
00:20:24,857 --> 00:20:26,857
of course, trying to get
the other person to laugh,

392
00:20:27,026 --> 00:20:28,688
like you are now.

393
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:32,195
And... Yeah, we used to do
that to each other quite often.

394
00:20:32,398 --> 00:20:33,832
Oh, he's got lots
of farm animals.

395
00:20:34,033 --> 00:20:37,367
I remember him teaching
me that it's a much better,

396
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:41,632
like, sexier, sensual kiss

397
00:20:41,807 --> 00:20:45,300
if you drink really, really hot
water before, like, your love scenes

398
00:20:45,478 --> 00:20:48,243
and, like, when you're
making out with somebody.

399
00:20:48,848 --> 00:20:52,080
He is happiest
driving a tractor,

400
00:20:52,251 --> 00:20:54,743
playing, you know,
with his son and wife,

401
00:20:54,920 --> 00:20:56,548
and having a good time.

402
00:20:56,756 --> 00:20:58,452
I was really happy that
he was coming back.

403
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,991
Actually, I was excited.
It felt right, you know?

404
00:21:01,160 --> 00:21:03,391
It felt like, "Where did you
go? Why did you leave?

405
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:04,689
Here you are and..."

406
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:07,197
We were very happy
to have him back.

407
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:08,959
And I'm...

408
00:21:09,168 --> 00:21:12,832
You know, like, he's
one of us, you know.

409
00:21:13,005 --> 00:21:15,702
He's just like family.

410
00:21:15,908 --> 00:21:17,240
MAN: And action.

411
00:21:17,409 --> 00:21:19,640
Boy, you look great.

412
00:21:20,112 --> 00:21:22,445
(BOTH LAUGH)

413
00:21:22,615 --> 00:21:23,742
I am.

414
00:21:23,916 --> 00:21:26,394
WOMAN: Why don't we just
start with a "Hi, is this a bad time?"

415
00:21:26,418 --> 00:21:28,046
Just step right back.

416
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:30,580
My character, I think, more
than any of the other characters

417
00:21:30,723 --> 00:21:33,283
just has been through the most.

418
00:21:33,492 --> 00:21:36,860
Our show had always
been kind of, you know,

419
00:21:37,029 --> 00:21:39,294
bad things that almost
happen to beautiful people.

420
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,900
That was like... That the
joke was over in the offices.

421
00:21:42,067 --> 00:21:44,502
But I was always like,
"Let it happen to me.

422
00:21:44,670 --> 00:21:47,230
Let something really bad
actually happen to the character."

423
00:21:47,406 --> 00:21:48,533
So they did.

424
00:21:50,342 --> 00:21:53,244
They shot her, they
burned her, raped her.

425
00:21:53,412 --> 00:21:54,812
They really took me seriously.

426
00:21:55,014 --> 00:21:58,610
Untie me, please. Tara, I
don't wanna die like this.

427
00:22:01,587 --> 00:22:02,587
Well, that was scary.

428
00:22:02,755 --> 00:22:04,755
The lesbian tried to pick
up on me in the bathroom,

429
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,950
we were locked in a house
that was burning down.

430
00:22:07,159 --> 00:22:09,151
I got shot by a
drive-by shooter.

431
00:22:10,462 --> 00:22:12,124
(MOANS)

432
00:22:12,298 --> 00:22:13,960
Kel, I got you. I got you.

433
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:17,268
So many. There's just
so many great memories.

434
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:18,698
Jennie's really...

435
00:22:18,871 --> 00:22:21,272
She's complex and yet
simple at the same time.

436
00:22:23,042 --> 00:22:26,012
I mean, if you get a chance to
know her and get to dig a little deeper,

437
00:22:26,212 --> 00:22:29,114
you'll realize that she's
got a lot depth of character.

438
00:22:29,281 --> 00:22:32,877
But, you know, on the day
to day, she's very easygoing.

439
00:22:33,052 --> 00:22:35,044
Very carefree.

440
00:22:35,221 --> 00:22:36,621
Just a very loving person.

441
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,690
To be completely honest,

442
00:22:40,192 --> 00:22:43,026
we didn't get along when
I first started on the show.

443
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:45,027
Did she tell you that? Oh, no?

444
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,859
(LAUGHS)

445
00:22:47,032 --> 00:22:50,901
Yeah, no, no, I think
it was very strange.

446
00:22:51,103 --> 00:22:53,663
"Oh, gosh, new girl. What's
this about?" kind of thing.

447
00:22:53,839 --> 00:22:56,536
And that lasted for
the first few weeks.

448
00:22:56,709 --> 00:22:58,268
And then it just completely...

449
00:22:58,444 --> 00:23:00,072
That whole barrier
was broken down.

450
00:23:00,246 --> 00:23:01,926
And I just... I got to
see the real Jennie.

451
00:23:02,047 --> 00:23:04,243
I think Jennie really
got to see the real me.

452
00:23:04,416 --> 00:23:07,079
And we became really,
really, really close really fast.

453
00:23:07,253 --> 00:23:10,189
And, you know, she's been
a great friend ever since.

454
00:23:10,756 --> 00:23:12,190
I have to stay in
touch with Jen.

455
00:23:12,358 --> 00:23:14,827
Because I can't imagine Luca
Bella, her baby, growing up

456
00:23:14,994 --> 00:23:16,587
and me not seeing her grow up.

457
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:19,629
We've been through a lot
together. I mean, her having a child.

458
00:23:19,798 --> 00:23:23,496
And me going through lots of
boyfriends and... No, I'm kidding.

459
00:23:23,869 --> 00:23:25,861
That... I'm kidding,
I'm really kidding.

460
00:23:26,038 --> 00:23:27,529
(LAUGHS)

461
00:23:27,706 --> 00:23:29,641
That might be a little true.

462
00:23:30,009 --> 00:23:31,705
I was going through
a terrible divorce.

463
00:23:31,877 --> 00:23:35,405
And one day out of nowhere
she just walked up to me

464
00:23:36,115 --> 00:23:38,949
and gave me a hug,
didn't say a word.

465
00:23:39,118 --> 00:23:43,214
And I remember thinking,
"That's all I needed, just a hug."

466
00:23:43,389 --> 00:23:45,290
So to me that was...

467
00:23:45,457 --> 00:23:47,449
To me, that's what
Jennie will always be.

468
00:23:47,660 --> 00:23:50,789
Here it is, baby. Today's work.

469
00:23:54,300 --> 00:23:55,598
This would be me right here.

470
00:23:57,202 --> 00:23:59,137
(ZIERING LAUGHS)

471
00:23:59,338 --> 00:24:00,829
What would I have changed?

472
00:24:01,173 --> 00:24:04,974
Uh... Well, tummy
tuck, eye lift.

473
00:24:05,144 --> 00:24:07,170
Pull the ears back a little bit.

474
00:24:07,346 --> 00:24:09,508
Chin job, nose job.

475
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:12,777
Caps, you know. Doing it all.

476
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:16,149
It's been great working, you know, in
the warehouse here and everything.

477
00:24:17,756 --> 00:24:19,019
But not in Van Nuys.

478
00:24:19,224 --> 00:24:22,490
I'm sure we would have all liked to
have been originally at the Fox studio,

479
00:24:22,661 --> 00:24:24,254
but it didn't work out that way.

480
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:26,991
Yeah, there was nothing
else around us, absolutely.

481
00:24:27,166 --> 00:24:29,246
There was no other shows,
no other, you know, people.

482
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:31,199
Nobody else except
for our cast and crew.

483
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:32,701
Summers are really hot.

484
00:24:34,273 --> 00:24:35,741
Winters aren't too pleasant.

485
00:24:35,908 --> 00:24:37,774
It's not in the best
neighborhood, but...

486
00:24:39,378 --> 00:24:40,869
We wanted to be
on a lot somewhere

487
00:24:41,046 --> 00:24:43,174
and have a commissary
and, you know...

488
00:24:43,382 --> 00:24:46,819
We had the worst
lunches in history.

489
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:50,923
We ate the worst food
every day, without fail.

490
00:24:51,090 --> 00:24:52,649
I do not miss lunch.

491
00:24:53,192 --> 00:24:57,254
Try ten years of Ian's egg whites
in the makeup trailer in the morning.

492
00:24:57,429 --> 00:25:00,593
You'd wanna have a
commissary too. Trust me.

493
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:03,200
Come on, stop the complaining.

494
00:25:03,669 --> 00:25:05,535
Hair, makeup, where
the hell are you?

495
00:25:05,738 --> 00:25:08,833
What would happen is, everybody
said, "You're the luckiest in the world."

496
00:25:09,008 --> 00:25:11,448
And God knows we were really
the luckiest people on the world.

497
00:25:11,577 --> 00:25:14,046
But on the other hand it was
so hard to say, "I'm scared."

498
00:25:14,213 --> 00:25:16,079
Like, "I don't know
how to handle this."

499
00:25:16,882 --> 00:25:19,010
ZIERING: There were a
lot of times where we just,

500
00:25:19,218 --> 00:25:22,086
you know, sit back over a beer
and talk about what's happening to us

501
00:25:22,254 --> 00:25:25,782
and, you know, how we were all
gonna make sure we stayed grounded.

502
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:28,085
"This is like a lot going
on, it's overwhelming.

503
00:25:28,293 --> 00:25:31,286
I mean, there's no book on
this, and how do I handle it?"

504
00:25:31,497 --> 00:25:33,898
One of us was gonna throw
the other person a lifeline

505
00:25:34,066 --> 00:25:35,762
if we saw something wrong.

506
00:25:35,968 --> 00:25:38,870
I just retreated to my house

507
00:25:39,038 --> 00:25:42,008
and you know, tried to calm
my life down as much as I could.

508
00:25:42,174 --> 00:25:48,808
Because things got a little
frantic and frenetic for a while.

509
00:25:48,981 --> 00:25:51,610
It wasn't anything that made
me particularly comfortable.

510
00:25:51,817 --> 00:25:55,015
And everybody took it differently, some
people got very quiet and introverted.

511
00:25:55,187 --> 00:25:57,088
Some people
were really out there

512
00:25:57,256 --> 00:26:00,420
and, you know, exploring
the limits and going for it.

513
00:26:00,592 --> 00:26:01,855
And then we'd come back

514
00:26:02,027 --> 00:26:04,963
in the one place that things would
balance out, would be on-stage.

515
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:08,828
Because that was the one
place that we were all together.

516
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:10,034
ANNOUNCER: <i>Coming up:</i>

517
00:26:10,202 --> 00:26:13,832
<i>We'll show you some exclusive
behind-the-scenes home videos</i>

518
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:17,170
<i>of the</i> 90210 <i>cast.</i>

519
00:26:17,843 --> 00:26:20,039
I got some sideburns, okay?

520
00:26:22,047 --> 00:26:25,848
ANNOUNCER: <i>Luke Perry reveals
how difficult it is to leave</i> 90210.

521
00:26:26,285 --> 00:26:28,277
For me, you know,
because I've done this before,

522
00:26:28,454 --> 00:26:30,650
and so I've prepared
myself for a lot of it.

523
00:26:30,823 --> 00:26:33,383
Second time around hopefully
will be a little easier for me.

524
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:35,988
ANNOUNCER: <i>And which
of the</i> 90210 <i>cast members</i>

525
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:39,598
<i>has changed the
most in ten years?</i>

526
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:45,297
<i>All when</i> Beverly Hills, 90210:
The Final Goodbye <i>returns.</i>

527
00:26:58,851 --> 00:27:00,444
MAN: Action.

528
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:03,818
All right, shoot.

529
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:06,456
SPELLING: I think it's hard
to show people being friends

530
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:07,625
if they're not friends.

531
00:27:07,793 --> 00:27:10,627
And we're all such
good friends and family.

532
00:27:10,796 --> 00:27:12,276
And we look out for
each other so much

533
00:27:12,397 --> 00:27:16,164
that what you see on TV,
us being a group, it's real.

534
00:27:18,137 --> 00:27:22,233
I've come to know Tori
as an incredible woman.

535
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:23,568
Super talented.

536
00:27:23,742 --> 00:27:28,407
Anything from comedy to drama,
she's got her bases covered.

537
00:27:28,947 --> 00:27:33,442
I was thinking of Tori and
how much I'm going to miss her.

538
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:38,057
All the amazing things that
make up who she is, you know?

539
00:27:38,223 --> 00:27:40,886
The great things,
the funny things.

540
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:45,463
The weird things, the
sad things, the bad things.

541
00:27:45,631 --> 00:27:48,430
Everything. I'm gonna
miss every single thing.

542
00:27:48,634 --> 00:27:50,796
She was quite shy.

543
00:27:51,603 --> 00:27:52,696
But very warm.

544
00:27:52,871 --> 00:27:56,205
Still, you know, some people
when they're shy like they still...

545
00:27:56,375 --> 00:27:57,866
They exude a great
warmth to them.

546
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:01,013
And she's always
had that, great warmth.

547
00:28:01,847 --> 00:28:05,045
She's grown up to be a terrific
young lady. She's really funny.

548
00:28:05,250 --> 00:28:06,650
I wanna do a few impressions.

549
00:28:09,588 --> 00:28:12,956
Whose shot is this
on? Waterman. Honey.

550
00:28:13,158 --> 00:28:19,257
She's a lot of fun, and she's
really got some good style going.

551
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:22,629
And I'm finally glad she
got a haircut that she likes.

552
00:28:22,834 --> 00:28:23,834
(LAUGHS)

553
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:28,968
Sometimes success is not only
being in the right place at the right time,

554
00:28:29,141 --> 00:28:30,341
but leaving at the right time.

555
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:32,170
I know this last show
for everybody else

556
00:28:32,344 --> 00:28:35,371
is kind of how I felt about a
year and a half ago when I left.

557
00:28:35,948 --> 00:28:38,281
Never ever look back.

558
00:28:47,993 --> 00:28:50,792
- Bye.
- Bye.

559
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:56,402
For me, you know,
because I've done this before,

560
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,799
and so I've prepared
myself for a lot of it.

561
00:28:58,971 --> 00:29:01,497
Second time around hopefully
will be a little easier for me.

562
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:04,541
Take a really long vacation.

563
00:29:04,710 --> 00:29:06,406
That's the best thing.

564
00:29:06,612 --> 00:29:08,478
It's gonna take a lot of
courage for everybody.

565
00:29:08,647 --> 00:29:11,139
Not because they
don't want to move on,

566
00:29:11,316 --> 00:29:13,236
but because you just
don't know what's out there.

567
00:29:13,418 --> 00:29:15,353
You just... It's an unknown.

568
00:29:15,554 --> 00:29:19,548
They're all adults and they're
all very intelligent people.

569
00:29:19,725 --> 00:29:21,250
And they'll make
their own decisions

570
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,418
and they'll be the
right decisions for them.

571
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:26,360
- I have no regrets.
- Neither do I.

572
00:29:34,673 --> 00:29:37,040
It was the greatest thing to
do and the hardest thing to do.

573
00:29:37,209 --> 00:29:40,111
And I think that for me
now, I look at the cast,

574
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:43,181
and me as being emotional
as I am, I cry for them too.

575
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:45,579
Because I know
that they're afraid.

576
00:29:45,751 --> 00:29:48,915
And I know that they're
excited and anticipating so much,

577
00:29:49,087 --> 00:29:51,989
and not knowing what's it's
gonna be like to leave this cocoon,

578
00:29:52,157 --> 00:29:55,719
a security, you know, something
that's so familiar to them.

579
00:29:55,894 --> 00:29:58,090
Sometimes you almost wish
it hadn't gone on this long,

580
00:29:58,263 --> 00:30:02,633
because, you know, it's a deeper
hole you gotta dig yourself out of.

581
00:30:02,834 --> 00:30:04,063
Coming back?

582
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,838
Maybe someday. Maybe not.

583
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:10,532
You're in a relationship that's
a lot deeper than you thought

584
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:12,109
and you gotta say
goodbye to people.

585
00:30:12,277 --> 00:30:15,076
And you didn't realize the space
that someone occupied in your life

586
00:30:15,280 --> 00:30:18,614
until you really stop and think, "Okay,
they're not gonna be there tomorrow.

587
00:30:18,784 --> 00:30:20,264
They're not gonna
be there next week."

588
00:30:20,385 --> 00:30:23,253
And when you can really start
to get your mind around that,

589
00:30:23,455 --> 00:30:25,424
it's pretty sad.

590
00:30:33,732 --> 00:30:35,166
CARTERIS: Once
you've been together,

591
00:30:35,334 --> 00:30:36,700
you're together
forever, you know?

592
00:30:36,868 --> 00:30:40,100
Their movement, it's just an
extension of a great, great life.

593
00:30:40,272 --> 00:30:42,264
Just a great life.

594
00:30:43,542 --> 00:30:44,976
ANNOUNCER: <i>Coming up:</i>

595
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:48,443
<i>The special relationship between
Ian Ziering and Brian Austin Green.</i>

596
00:30:48,647 --> 00:30:52,277
He had a neck, I swear to God,
I could almost palm his neck.

597
00:30:52,718 --> 00:30:56,553
That was his show
of size and power,

598
00:30:56,722 --> 00:30:58,486
was to carry me
around by my neck.

599
00:30:59,224 --> 00:31:03,252
ANNOUNCER: <i>And the final</i>
90210 <i>cast-and-crew photo.</i>

600
00:31:05,597 --> 00:31:09,557
<i>When</i> Beverly Hills, 90210:
The Final Goodbye <i>returns.</i>

601
00:31:19,311 --> 00:31:21,644
Brian's the most different. I
think we'd all agree on that.

602
00:31:21,847 --> 00:31:23,577
He was shorter than me. Heh-heh.

603
00:31:23,782 --> 00:31:26,217
Oh, Brian was so
little when we started.

604
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:27,444
He was like a little boy.

605
00:31:27,619 --> 00:31:31,181
And now he's like this
big handsome actor boy.

606
00:31:31,390 --> 00:31:33,086
He was small.

607
00:31:33,258 --> 00:31:35,818
He's not anymore, but
he was small back then.

608
00:31:35,994 --> 00:31:38,987
And I remember, I...

609
00:31:39,698 --> 00:31:41,997
I remember him being small.

610
00:31:42,200 --> 00:31:44,040
His voice was so high,
it was higher than mine.

611
00:31:44,669 --> 00:31:46,001
Oh, what's in a name?

612
00:31:46,204 --> 00:31:51,370
He had a neck, I swear to God, I could
almost palm his neck when we started.

613
00:31:51,543 --> 00:31:53,637
Oh, little Brian. We used
to call him "Young Bri."

614
00:31:54,079 --> 00:31:56,844
Yeah, I was like 5'4" when
we started doing the show.

615
00:31:57,015 --> 00:31:59,780
So he would pick
me up by my neck.

616
00:31:59,951 --> 00:32:03,820
That was his show
of size and power,

617
00:32:04,022 --> 00:32:05,854
was to carry me
around by my neck.

618
00:32:06,024 --> 00:32:07,219
(LAUGHS)

619
00:32:07,392 --> 00:32:10,294
It's... There's not much
story to it, he did it every day.

620
00:32:10,462 --> 00:32:11,987
It was kind of a
daily thing, you know.

621
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:14,632
- See him in the makeup trailer, "Hey."
- Brian.

622
00:32:14,833 --> 00:32:17,064
"Z, good morning." Pick me
up and, "Hey, how you doing?"

623
00:32:17,269 --> 00:32:19,465
With friends like Z,
who needs enemies?

624
00:32:24,042 --> 00:32:25,533
Look, I got one.

625
00:32:25,710 --> 00:32:27,804
(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

626
00:32:31,917 --> 00:32:33,476
Yay.

627
00:32:34,453 --> 00:32:35,682
Thanks, guys.

628
00:32:35,854 --> 00:32:39,655
I need a new one. It's
broken, the light doesn't work.

629
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:43,426
I loved this crew. I've
never loved a crew more.

630
00:32:43,628 --> 00:32:47,030
I mean, it's amazing.

631
00:32:47,232 --> 00:32:49,224
(ALL CHATTERING)

632
00:32:55,674 --> 00:32:57,472
TATA: We got the best
crew and cast in town.

633
00:32:57,676 --> 00:33:00,202
I mean, everybody says that
I guess, but I really mean it.

634
00:33:02,848 --> 00:33:07,809
GREEN: Aaron is real good
at finding honest people.

635
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:11,821
If you look at the people on his
shows and the people that work for him,

636
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:15,084
and you meet our crew and
you meet everybody here...

637
00:33:16,294 --> 00:33:17,734
And it's an amazing
group of people.

638
00:33:17,896 --> 00:33:22,664
And it mirrors what
the man in charge is.

639
00:33:25,170 --> 00:33:27,196
CARTERIS: <i>When I
first met Aaron, I thought:</i>

640
00:33:27,372 --> 00:33:29,466
<i>"Oh, my God, he's the
one who did</i> Love Boat.

641
00:33:29,674 --> 00:33:32,872
<i>Oh, my God</i>, Fantasy Island.
<i>And he did</i> Charlie's Angels."

642
00:33:33,078 --> 00:33:36,913
First of all, I... From what I understand,
he's relatively new to the business.

643
00:33:37,115 --> 00:33:38,555
<i>I would say, "Hey,
keep your chin up.</i>

644
00:33:38,717 --> 00:33:40,447
<i>You have a bright
future in this business."</i>

645
00:33:40,652 --> 00:33:43,952
It's funny, he's amazing, he...

646
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:49,151
I mean, through every change of
time, he's done shows that just adapt.

647
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:51,728
<i>And it's the funniest thing,</i>

648
00:33:51,897 --> 00:33:54,890
<i>people would think he wouldn't know
anything about doing a teen drama.</i>

649
00:33:55,066 --> 00:33:57,558
And yet, he's so
hip to everything.

650
00:33:57,736 --> 00:33:59,762
You know, he tells
me about fashion.

651
00:33:59,938 --> 00:34:03,568
He's so in tune with all that,
and he's such a... He's so great.

652
00:34:03,775 --> 00:34:06,802
When I first came in and
auditioned for <i>90210...</i>

653
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:10,039
And I remember of course
being very nervous and excited.

654
00:34:10,248 --> 00:34:12,774
<i>And really thrilled
to even be there.</i>

655
00:34:12,984 --> 00:34:15,504
And I remember hearing my
name being called, "Tiffani, Tiffani."

656
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:17,054
Screaming, screaming, screaming.

657
00:34:17,222 --> 00:34:21,353
And I turn around and I look up in
this window with all the Fox executives.

658
00:34:21,560 --> 00:34:23,995
And Aaron, like, sitting
in the middle like God.

659
00:34:24,162 --> 00:34:26,688
You know, like he is, the boss,

660
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:29,664
saying with open arms, just:

661
00:34:29,834 --> 00:34:32,861
"Welcome to the show. We're
so excited. You've got the job."

662
00:34:33,505 --> 00:34:38,739
<i>Aaron's been sort of like, you
know, a father figure in a way.</i>

663
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:41,675
Like a
father-that-I-never-see figure.

664
00:34:41,846 --> 00:34:44,611
Like he's just kind of
there like God somehow.

665
00:34:44,816 --> 00:34:48,218
I've talked about
Aaron a million times,

666
00:34:48,386 --> 00:34:50,719
and tried to speak in
a million different ways,

667
00:34:50,889 --> 00:34:53,552
and always comes
around to the same thing:

668
00:34:53,725 --> 00:34:55,489
He's one of the most
loyal men I've ever met.

669
00:34:55,660 --> 00:34:58,562
He has picked up the phone
after the show had been on TV,

670
00:34:58,730 --> 00:34:59,857
you know, at 10:00 at night.

671
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,795
"Ian, great job tonight.

672
00:35:01,967 --> 00:35:04,869
Really, really sold it for
me. Working hard, guy."

673
00:35:05,036 --> 00:35:08,200
<i>You know, that just puts a big smile
on my face, makes me feel warm.</i>

674
00:35:08,640 --> 00:35:10,632
It changed my life, and
thank you a million times.

675
00:35:11,209 --> 00:35:13,371
<i>I've always tried
to say that to him.</i>

676
00:35:13,578 --> 00:35:16,275
<i>So I hope... Aaron, I
hope you get to see this.</i>

677
00:35:16,448 --> 00:35:18,417
You know, I'll say I
worked with the big guy.

678
00:35:18,583 --> 00:35:19,710
When this is over and done,

679
00:35:19,884 --> 00:35:22,581
people are gonna be remembering,
you know, the people of television,

680
00:35:22,754 --> 00:35:24,620
and he'll probably
be at the top of the list.

681
00:35:24,789 --> 00:35:27,623
And I'll say, "Yeah, and that
was the guy I started out with."

682
00:35:27,826 --> 00:35:31,228
Aaron was the greatest
teacher I ever had.

683
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:34,695
He taught me about television
and he taught me about producing,

684
00:35:34,899 --> 00:35:39,428
and he taught me about life,
and he taught me about friendship,

685
00:35:39,638 --> 00:35:41,197
and he taught me about honor.

686
00:35:41,373 --> 00:35:44,741
And I love Aaron with all my heart
and I will love him until the day I die.

687
00:35:44,909 --> 00:35:46,104
And he is just one of...

688
00:35:46,277 --> 00:35:49,042
Is absolutely one of the
greatest men I've ever known.

689
00:35:50,115 --> 00:35:53,381
Oh, you dirty people.

690
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:56,452
Okay, thank you.

691
00:35:57,489 --> 00:35:58,855
I've had it.

692

ANNOUNCER: <i>Coming up:</i>

693
00:36:00,859 --> 00:36:03,260
<i>A special thank you
to the fans of</i> 90210.

694
00:36:03,762 --> 00:36:05,856
Without them we
wouldn't have had a show.

695
00:36:06,031 --> 00:36:09,195
And, I mean, I'm just
so grateful to all of them.

696
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:13,203
<i>And the cast shares their private
thoughts on the final episode.</i>

697
00:36:13,405 --> 00:36:17,240
ANNOUNCER: To think what
life is gonna be like without them...

698
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:19,435
I can't imagine it.

699
00:36:19,644 --> 00:36:23,581
ANNOUNCER: <i>When</i> Beverly Hill,
90210: The Final Goodbye <i>returns.</i>

700
00:36:32,424 --> 00:36:34,904
WOMAN 1: Just wait here in
the next shot. Everybody, just wait.

701
00:36:35,060 --> 00:36:37,029
Here we go, ready and...

702
00:36:39,431 --> 00:36:42,094
- Roll, please.
WOMAN 2: Rolling.

703
00:36:42,867 --> 00:36:45,803
MAN: Okay, smile. Okay.

704
00:36:45,970 --> 00:36:46,970
Nice.

705
00:36:50,175 --> 00:36:52,007
We have great fans on our show.

706
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:53,644
It's really very flattering

707
00:36:53,812 --> 00:36:57,112
when people approach you
and they tell you, you know:

708
00:36:57,882 --> 00:37:00,044
"I was late to the prom
because I didn't wanna leave.

709
00:37:00,218 --> 00:37:02,538
Because your show was on.
You know, it was the last thing."

710
00:37:02,620 --> 00:37:05,590
"My wife wouldn't go to the
hospital, she was having a baby.

711
00:37:05,757 --> 00:37:07,623
She didn't wanna leave
till the show was over.

712
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:10,591
We had to drive in the
car watching a small TV.

713
00:37:10,762 --> 00:37:13,095
When we got there, she
named the baby after you."

714
00:37:13,264 --> 00:37:16,428
You know, we hear
stories like that, crazy stuff.

715
00:37:16,634 --> 00:37:19,297
I have people come up and
telling me all the time, you know:

716
00:37:19,471 --> 00:37:21,599
"You're such a great
addition to the cast."

717
00:37:21,773 --> 00:37:25,642
And that feels so good because
they've been doing this way before I was.

718
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,745
And it's their show,
I really believe that.

719
00:37:27,946 --> 00:37:30,438
People would send me
gifts when I had my baby.

720
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:33,380
They sent my baby
gifts. How nice is that?

721
00:37:33,551 --> 00:37:37,488
Like knitting her things, you know?
They don't even know me. It's so nice.

722
00:37:37,956 --> 00:37:40,084
Without them, we
wouldn't have had a show.

723
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:44,662
And, I mean, I'm just
so grateful to all of them.

724
00:37:45,563 --> 00:37:47,498
Send a big kiss:

725

OVER SPEAKERS)

726
00:38:07,786 --> 00:38:08,786

727

(CHEERS AND APPLAUSE)

728
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:22,360
I'm gonna miss every single
thing, the good and the bad and...

729
00:39:24,028 --> 00:39:25,860
I hope that people will
remember me that way.

730
00:39:26,030 --> 00:39:27,623
Remember all the facets of me

731
00:39:27,799 --> 00:39:30,200
and all the things that
make me who I am.

732
00:39:30,368 --> 00:39:34,829
Because they certainly know a
lot of different things about me.

733
00:39:35,006 --> 00:39:36,872
And that they still like me.

734
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:40,341
And they still love me is
a good thing, you know.

735
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:43,572
A lot of the funny little
antics that, you know, we did.

736
00:39:43,748 --> 00:39:46,513
In the makeup trailer and,
you know, stuff like that.

737
00:39:46,684 --> 00:39:48,676
Those are memories
that you'll never forget.

738
00:39:48,887 --> 00:39:52,153
And I'm hoping that will be
the same for them with me.

739
00:39:52,357 --> 00:39:53,437
I have my memories of them,

740
00:39:53,591 --> 00:39:56,151
they'll have memories
of me, and that's perfect.

741
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:59,748
You know, generally I
wanna be remembered as...

742
00:41:01,025 --> 00:41:02,220
A real person.

743
00:41:02,427 --> 00:41:04,396
That's what I want
people to know me for.

744
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:07,497
That, regardless, I put myself
out and I was honest to people.

745
00:41:07,665 --> 00:41:09,293
And that carries
over into everything.

746
00:41:09,500 --> 00:41:11,332
The thing that I would
like people to remember

747
00:41:11,502 --> 00:41:14,301
is that I came in with
a smile every day.

748
00:41:14,772 --> 00:41:16,452
I'd like to think that
I'd still know them.

749
00:41:16,607 --> 00:41:18,967
You know, I'd like to think
that we would still be in touch.

750
00:41:19,110 --> 00:41:24,310
I don't know how realistic that
is, but I think it's pretty realistic.

751
00:41:24,515 --> 00:41:28,646
I will remember all these people as
being a very significant part of my life.

752
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,982
I hope that that's how
I'm remembered to them.

753
00:41:31,189 --> 00:41:33,158
I'm so in the present right now.

754
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:37,625
I'm so full and so nourished with
my relationships with these people

755
00:41:37,829 --> 00:41:41,732
that I can't imagine thinking

756
00:41:42,800 --> 00:41:47,135
of them in a way
away from this show.

757
00:41:47,338 --> 00:41:50,399
To think what life's gonna
be like without them...

758
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:53,402
I can't imagine it.

759
00:41:53,611 --> 00:41:55,211
I don't want them to
have to remember me,

760
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:58,407
because I want to still be
very much still in their lives.

761
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:02,648
I don't want them to have to look
back and be like, "She was a great gal."

762
00:42:02,820 --> 00:42:04,254
I hope we're all still friends.

763
00:42:04,455 --> 00:42:08,620
Hopefully I'm the same guy
going out as I was coming in.

764
00:42:11,662 --> 00:42:14,655
We've gone through a lot of stuff,
and it's gonna make you different.

765
00:42:14,832 --> 00:42:19,133
But I think if you can basically
hold on to the core of who you are,

766
00:42:19,303 --> 00:42:21,295
you're really doing okay.
