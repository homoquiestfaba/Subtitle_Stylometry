1
00:00:35,335 --> 00:00:38,099
Let's roll!

2
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:49,614
Hey!
I'm coming!

3
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,658
Huh?!

4
00:01:12,072 --> 00:01:14,097
Yes!

5
00:01:17,077 --> 00:01:19,568
- Are you and I going fast?
- Hey!

6
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:39,328
- <i>Hello?</i>
- <i>Walter?</i>

7
00:01:39,365 --> 00:01:42,266
- <i>Yes?</i>
<i>- I have some bad news</i>.

8
00:01:42,302 --> 00:01:44,293
<i>It's about your</i>
<i>two uncles, son</i>.

9
00:01:45,338 --> 00:01:47,568
<i>Walter?</i>

10
00:01:47,607 --> 00:01:51,771
<i>Walter? Walter?</i>

11
00:01:51,811 --> 00:01:53,210
<i>Good news...</i>

12
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:56,044
you're spending the summer
with your two uncles.

13
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:01,785
It's just gonna be for a few weeks.
A month or two, tops.

14
00:02:02,789 --> 00:02:04,723
<i>Scout's honor, okay?</i>

15
00:02:06,559 --> 00:02:09,756
Cross my heart
and hope to die, okay?

16
00:02:10,763 --> 00:02:13,061
Where are you going
this time?

17
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:16,591
The Fort Worth College
of Court Reporting.

18
00:02:16,636 --> 00:02:18,103
I met a guy
last night.

19
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,163
<i>He's gonna pull</i>
<i>some strings</i>.

20
00:02:22,275 --> 00:02:25,676
Walter, you're gonna have
to learn to trust people,

21
00:02:25,712 --> 00:02:28,738
or you're gonna grow up
bitter and disappointed.

22
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:34,076
You're gonna have fun
with your two uncles. You'll see.

23
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:36,247
Mom, you're
an only child.

24
00:02:36,289 --> 00:02:38,814
I know
what uncles are.

25
00:02:39,826 --> 00:02:42,886
Well, Mr. Smarty Pants,

26
00:02:42,929 --> 00:02:45,955
It just so happens,
they really are your uncles.

27
00:02:45,999 --> 00:02:47,899
Your great-uncles.

28
00:02:47,934 --> 00:02:49,902
<i>My mother's brothers</i>.

29
00:02:49,936 --> 00:02:53,599
They disappeared 40 years ago
and just showed up back here in Texas.

30
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:55,699
- Can't I come with you?
- No!

31
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:01,806
Honey, I'm gonna be working my tail
off learning court reporting.

32
00:03:01,848 --> 00:03:04,715
I'm doing everything
I can to keep this family together.

33
00:03:04,751 --> 00:03:08,152
How about a little
help here, okay?

34
00:03:12,058 --> 00:03:15,824
Now, look...
they say these two old men

35
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:19,628
got millions
stashed away in cash.

36
00:03:19,666 --> 00:03:21,725
Nobody knows
where they got it.

37
00:03:21,768 --> 00:03:25,295
Got no kids, no one to leave
all that money to.

38
00:03:25,338 --> 00:03:27,863
You and me, we're as close
as any family they got.

39
00:03:30,343 --> 00:03:32,208
You want them
to like me

40
00:03:32,245 --> 00:03:35,214
so they'll die and leave us
their money?

41
00:03:36,616 --> 00:03:39,710
We could buy a house,
maybe settle down.

42
00:03:39,752 --> 00:03:41,947
<i>Oh, wouldn't that</i>
<i>be nice?</i>

43
00:03:43,156 --> 00:03:45,351
Oh, look! Here it is.

44
00:03:45,391 --> 00:03:47,951
Here it is, honey.
Here it is.

45
00:03:50,964 --> 00:03:52,295
By the way,

46
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:54,766
I hear these two were in
some state nuthouse for 40 years.

47
00:03:54,801 --> 00:03:56,962
Got all their money
from a big lawsuit or something.

48
00:03:57,003 --> 00:04:00,302
<i>But then there's</i>
<i>lots of stories about them</i>.

49
00:04:00,340 --> 00:04:03,309
<i>Who knows what</i>
<i>to believe?</i>

50
00:04:03,343 --> 00:04:07,143
<i>Just find out where they stashed</i>
<i>all that money, okay?</i>

51
00:04:07,180 --> 00:04:09,239
Maybe we should've
called first.

52
00:04:09,282 --> 00:04:12,683
No. Older people
just love surprises!

53
00:04:13,586 --> 00:04:15,884
Here we are.

54
00:04:18,625 --> 00:04:20,092
Okay.

55
00:04:29,302 --> 00:04:30,599
Go away, go away!

56
00:04:30,637 --> 00:04:33,367
Hey, go away! Shoo!

57
00:04:33,406 --> 00:04:36,603
Show 'em you're friendly, honey.
Let them smell your hand.

58
00:04:42,081 --> 00:04:44,174
They must be down there
by that lake.

59
00:04:44,217 --> 00:04:46,742
Let's go!
Come on!

60
00:04:49,222 --> 00:04:51,122
There he is!

61
00:04:52,425 --> 00:04:55,326
- Winged him.
- He's running for it.

62
00:05:00,066 --> 00:05:02,864
- Damn! Empty.
- Get ammo. I'll keep him covered.

63
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:03,891
<i>Yoo-hoo!</i>

64
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,338
Huh?

65
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:10,708
Yoo-hoo!

66
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:13,109
You send for a hooker?

67
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:16,604
Uncle Hub, Uncle Garth,
it's me, Mae!

68
00:05:19,285 --> 00:05:20,946
Mae!

69
00:05:22,422 --> 00:05:24,913
Pearl's daughter.

70
00:05:24,957 --> 00:05:27,084
And I brought Walter,

71
00:05:27,126 --> 00:05:28,491
your nephew.

72
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,988
- Relatives.
- Damn! God.

73
00:05:35,535 --> 00:05:37,298
We're old, damn it.
Leave us alone!

74
00:05:37,337 --> 00:05:39,828
The last thing we need is
some little sissy boy

75
00:05:39,872 --> 00:05:41,339
hanging around all summer.

76
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:43,707
Walter, honey,

77
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:46,940
why don't you wait out here
and play, okay? I'll be a minute.

78
00:05:55,988 --> 00:05:58,650
<i>He could help out around here,</i>
<i>do chores</i>.

79
00:05:58,691 --> 00:06:01,216
<i>Help out?</i>
<i>Your kid's a damn wienie</i>.

80
00:06:01,260 --> 00:06:04,957
<i>I know. That's why he needs</i>
<i>to be around real men,</i>

81
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:08,626
<i>like you two</i>.
<i>It won't be for long</i>.

82
00:06:08,668 --> 00:06:11,694
<i>He's got to cook for his</i>
<i>damn self. I'm not cooking</i>.

83
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:22,045
Nice doggie.
Come play.

84
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,852
This is for your own good,
Walter.

85
00:06:26,886 --> 00:06:28,183
You know...

86
00:06:28,221 --> 00:06:30,951
I bet all that money
is hidden real close by.

87
00:06:30,990 --> 00:06:32,890
Imagine,
a real buried treasure

88
00:06:32,925 --> 00:06:35,086
just like in those books
you're always reading.

89
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:41,164
Walter, maybe if you'd learn
to smile once in a while,

90
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,464
then people
might like you.

91
00:06:45,204 --> 00:06:48,605
Now, come on, how about a big smile
to remember you by?

92
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:51,508
Okay?
Come on!

93
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:59,983
You're gonna have to work on
that smile while I'm gone, okay?

94
00:07:03,022 --> 00:07:05,991
Bye, honey!
Bye!

95
00:07:27,947 --> 00:07:29,505
Well?

96
00:08:00,746 --> 00:08:03,214
If my mom calls,
can we hear the telephone out here?

97
00:08:03,249 --> 00:08:05,217
Don't have one.

98
00:08:05,251 --> 00:08:07,276
No telephone?!

99
00:08:11,424 --> 00:08:14,325
Is it okay if I go inside
and watch television?

100
00:08:15,361 --> 00:08:16,385
Ain't got one.

101
00:08:16,429 --> 00:08:18,556
No television?!

102
00:08:19,799 --> 00:08:21,892
What do you do?

103
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,450
Hey!

104
00:08:39,752 --> 00:08:42,983
Rumor has is you two have
millions stashed away.

105
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,320
<i>Why not put some of that money</i>
<i>to work for you</i>

106
00:08:45,358 --> 00:08:48,885
with the high yield only investing
in gold and silver can bring?

107
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:54,831
¤ <i>Wee-ooh!</i>
<i>Wee-ooh, wee-ooh!</i> ¤

108
00:08:54,867 --> 00:08:56,300
Can I leave you
some pamphlets?

109
00:08:59,472 --> 00:09:00,905
¤ <i>Wee-ooh, wee-ooh</i> ¤

110
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:05,468
¤ <i>Ooh, ooh, wee-ooh,</i>
<i>wee-ooh</i> ¤

111
00:09:05,511 --> 00:09:09,675
¤ <i>I can see them dancing,</i>
<i>the silhouettes on the shade</i> ¤

112
00:09:09,715 --> 00:09:11,706
¤ <i>I hear the music</i> ¤

113
00:09:11,751 --> 00:09:14,185
¤ <i>All the lovers on parade,</i>
<i>open up</i> ¤

114
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:17,189
¤ <i>I wanna come in again</i> ¤

115
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:20,454
¤ <i>I thought</i>
<i>you were my friend</i>... ¤

116
00:09:20,493 --> 00:09:22,757
Gentlemen, word is out...

117
00:09:22,795 --> 00:09:25,025
you are two sophisticated
men of means...

118
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:29,159
Hey!

119
00:09:29,201 --> 00:09:35,299
¤ <i>Movin' and a-groovin'</i>
<i>with that beat</i> ¤

120
00:09:35,341 --> 00:09:43,009
¤ <i>Jumpin' and stompin'</i>
<i>on the floor</i> ¤

121
00:09:43,049 --> 00:09:46,951
- ¤ <i>Let me in, open up</i> ¤
- ¤ <i>Let me in, open up</i> ¤

122
00:09:46,986 --> 00:09:50,251
¤ <i>I'll open up</i>
<i>that door</i> ¤

123
00:09:50,289 --> 00:09:54,521
¤ <i>I hear the music,</i>
<i>let me in</i> ¤

124
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:57,085
¤ <i>Wee-ooh, wee-ooh</i>. ¤

125
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:03,760
Nice evening. Peaceful.

126
00:10:10,543 --> 00:10:13,011
Hey, kid.

127
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:16,913
You sleep up there.
In the tower.

128
00:10:23,189 --> 00:10:27,683
Hey... we don't know
nothing about kids.

129
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:30,719
- So if you need something...
- Find it yourself.

130
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:33,163
Or better yet,
learn to do without.

131
00:10:33,199 --> 00:10:37,158
- We're both getting old.
- Fixing to die any time.

132
00:10:37,203 --> 00:10:40,639
So if we kick off
in the middle of the night,

133
00:10:41,674 --> 00:10:43,972
you're on your own.

134
00:10:52,018 --> 00:10:54,612
- Jumpy little fella.
- Mmm.

135
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:56,383
Quiet though.

136
00:13:58,938 --> 00:14:01,236
Uncle Hub?

137
00:14:02,308 --> 00:14:03,741
Uncle Hub?

138
00:14:20,092 --> 00:14:22,287
He's sleepwalking.

139
00:15:28,294 --> 00:15:31,957
Brand new mattress and I'm still
waking up tired and sore.

140
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:56,784
So...

141
00:15:56,822 --> 00:15:59,916
you two
disappeared for...

142
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:02,655
40 whole years.

143
00:16:02,695 --> 00:16:04,720
Where were you?

144
00:16:07,466 --> 00:16:10,128
Africa mostly...
Morocco,

145
00:16:10,169 --> 00:16:11,898
Algeria, Kenya...

146
00:16:11,937 --> 00:16:14,269
Not much sadder than a couple
of has-beens jabbering

147
00:16:14,306 --> 00:16:16,297
about the good old days.

148
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,867
Those days are through.
So are we.

149
00:16:32,458 --> 00:16:35,018
I hate this!

150
00:16:35,060 --> 00:16:38,621
- I hate it!
- We're retired.

151
00:16:38,664 --> 00:16:42,293
Gardening is what
retired people do.

152
00:16:42,334 --> 00:16:45,235
What do we want any
damn vegetables for anyway?

153
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:48,535
They're good for you.
Make you live to be 100.

154
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:52,408
Oh yeah? Yeah?
To hell with that.

155
00:16:53,479 --> 00:16:55,310
You live to be 100.

156
00:17:00,019 --> 00:17:03,682
- Hey, Uncle Hub!
- Hub, how are you doing?

157
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:05,053
Kids, say hi to Uncle Hub.

158
00:17:05,090 --> 00:17:07,354
Hub, come back here and see
who we brought.

159
00:17:07,393 --> 00:17:09,691
Uncle Garth!
Kids, say hi to Uncle Garth!

160
00:17:11,563 --> 00:17:13,531
We're here
for a nice long visit.

161
00:17:13,565 --> 00:17:17,695
The whole weekend. We know how lonely
our favorite uncles get.

162
00:17:23,942 --> 00:17:25,876
Who the hell are you?

163
00:17:27,513 --> 00:17:30,004
- Walter.
- Walter?!

164
00:17:30,049 --> 00:17:32,813
<i>Mae's boy?</i>

165
00:17:32,851 --> 00:17:36,878
Pearl's daughter... that loose widow
woman always running around.

166
00:17:36,922 --> 00:17:39,823
- It figures she'd muscle in.
- Is Mae here?

167
00:17:41,193 --> 00:17:42,785
How long
are you here for?

168
00:17:44,763 --> 00:17:46,993
Well, we'll just see
about that.

169
00:17:47,032 --> 00:17:49,364
We know
what you're up to.

170
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,495
Don't think you're gonna
get away with it.

171
00:17:52,538 --> 00:17:55,530
<i>Come on, boys</i>.
<i>Come on</i>.

172
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:58,202
His momma's gonna be back
before long.

173
00:17:58,243 --> 00:17:59,733
Oh, that woman? Huh!

174
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:02,008
From what I hear, she may never
come back. What then?

175
00:18:02,047 --> 00:18:03,537
Then you'd be stuck
with him.

176
00:18:06,118 --> 00:18:08,848
<i>I'm telling you, take him</i>
<i>to the orphanage right this minute</i>.

177
00:18:08,887 --> 00:18:10,514
Whether we take him
to the orphanage

178
00:18:10,556 --> 00:18:12,148
or tie him up and throw him
in the lake,

179

<i>it's our business,</i>
<i>not yours</i>.

180
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,819
Here he is now, spying!

181
00:18:18,263 --> 00:18:19,855
Ow! Ow, ow!

182
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:22,594
See what I'm saying?
Did you see what he just did?

183
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:23,623
Mmm-hmm.

184
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:39,050
<i>Fort Worth College</i>

185
00:18:39,084 --> 00:18:41,882
<i>I need to find my mom</i>.
<i>She's a student there</i>.

186
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,785
<i>I'm sorry, we're closed</i>.

187
00:18:43,822 --> 00:18:46,154
It's an emergency.
Please?

188
00:18:46,191 --> 00:18:48,250
Her name's Mae...
Mae Coleman.

189
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,522
Um...

190
00:18:52,564 --> 00:18:57,467
<i>No, I'm sorry, there's no</i>
<i>Mae Coleman registered here</i>.

191

Oh! Try Mae Carter.

192
00:19:03,008 --> 00:19:06,102
No, I'm sorry.

<i>Young man, are you</i>
<i>in some sort of trouble?</i>

197
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:19,416
She's gotta be there!
She just started.

198
00:19:19,458 --> 00:19:23,451
Listen, our classes
started back in January.

199
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:25,963
No one could have possibly
just started.

200
00:19:28,967 --> 00:19:32,403
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

201
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:35,563
<i>Hello?</i>

202
00:19:41,680 --> 00:19:44,672
Hub, I don't know why
you have to drive. It's my car.

203
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:46,274
Stop whining.

204
00:19:47,719 --> 00:19:51,086
If we find the kid, he's gonna
get a piece of my mind.

205
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:53,091
There he is.

206
00:20:02,634 --> 00:20:05,034
Lawyer...
stay in the car!

207
00:20:05,070 --> 00:20:07,470
Hub, come on!

208
00:20:07,506 --> 00:20:09,838
- No, no. You, not me, no.
- Hub!

209
00:20:09,875 --> 00:20:11,934
Get out of the car.

210
00:20:33,899 --> 00:20:35,867
Planning
your next move?

211
00:20:38,203 --> 00:20:40,398
Where you figure
on going?

212
00:20:42,841 --> 00:20:44,035
Here.

213
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,044
Area code 406...

214
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:48,638
Montana.

215
00:20:50,949 --> 00:20:55,283
How come you're not heading
to Fort Worth where your momma is?

216
00:20:57,089 --> 00:20:58,989
She's not there.

217
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,960
She lied...

218
00:21:01,994 --> 00:21:03,359
again.

219
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,028
<i>Listen, kid,</i>

220
00:21:08,066 --> 00:21:12,025
we know you got your heart set on
going to Montana,

221
00:21:13,071 --> 00:21:14,766
but it's late.

222
00:21:15,807 --> 00:21:18,207
Hub, help me out here.

223
00:21:18,243 --> 00:21:21,337
Why? It sounds like
his mind's made up.

224
00:21:22,381 --> 00:21:24,178
Good luck
in Montana, kid.

225
00:21:27,452 --> 00:21:30,080
We've got better maps than that one
at the house, right, Hub?

226
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:33,649
Yeah, a man needs a good map,
that's for sure.

227
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:34,954
Sure.

228
00:21:36,595 --> 00:21:38,961
I've been
to the orphan home before.

229
00:21:38,997 --> 00:21:40,794
I don't want to go back.

230
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:41,958
<i>Damn it, kid,</i>

231
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:44,628
it ain't our fault you got
a lousy damn mother.

232
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:01,481
<i>Guess I should get going</i>.

233
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:03,215
Which way is north?

234
00:22:10,162 --> 00:22:11,925
I'll say one thing
for this kid...

235
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:14,454
he sure pisses off
the relatives.

236
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:18,626
Listen, kid,
do us a favor.

237
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,797
If you come back
to the house

238
00:22:20,839 --> 00:22:23,103
and stay awhile,

239
00:22:23,141 --> 00:22:26,042
why, our relatives
are gonna hate it.

240
00:22:26,078 --> 00:22:28,546
I'll bet they hate it
so much,

241
00:22:28,580 --> 00:22:32,141
they go away and leave us all
the hell alone.

242
00:22:33,552 --> 00:22:37,613
- It's crazy enough it might work.
- Sure.

243
00:22:37,656 --> 00:22:41,422
Come on, kid,
help us out here.

244
00:22:44,796 --> 00:22:46,855
I guess I could
come back...

245
00:22:47,899 --> 00:22:49,594
for a while,

246
00:22:49,634 --> 00:22:52,364
seeing it's
so important.

247
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:09,747
So kid,

248
00:23:09,788 --> 00:23:11,779
how's that root beer?

249
00:23:23,368 --> 00:23:26,735
Uncle Hub,
Uncle Garth,

250
00:23:26,772 --> 00:23:28,763
this has been
such...

251
00:23:28,807 --> 00:23:30,934
a wonderful weekend.

252
00:23:30,976 --> 00:23:32,739
I hate
to bring this up,

253
00:23:32,778 --> 00:23:35,770
but have you two looked
at that will I left for you?

254
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:41,745
You both need to be thinking
about these things

255
00:23:41,787 --> 00:23:43,015
at your age.

256
00:23:57,169 --> 00:23:59,763
Don't shoot!
Don't shoot.

257
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,568
He's been
here before.

258
00:24:01,606 --> 00:24:03,597
Brothers McCann?

259
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:05,906
This is
no ordinary salesman.

260
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,912
Hell, I like me
a challenge.

261
00:24:07,946 --> 00:24:09,436
Can we talk?

262
00:24:09,481 --> 00:24:10,846
Come out where
we can see you.

263
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:12,907
Put down your guns
and I'll come out.

264
00:24:12,951 --> 00:24:15,112
This guy is good.

265
00:24:15,153 --> 00:24:17,815
I'll cover,
you sneak around.

266
00:24:17,856 --> 00:24:19,483
...<i>that's not complete</i>.

267
00:24:19,524 --> 00:24:21,515
What? What do you...
what? What?

268
00:24:21,560 --> 00:24:24,256
- Why not see what he's selling?
- <i>Let me just show it to you</i>.

269
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:27,231
- What the hell for?
- It's right behind my car.

270
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:29,563
What's the good having money
if you never spend it?

271
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,865
- Trust me.
- It could be the kid has a point.

272
00:24:31,903 --> 00:24:33,871
Yeah, well...

273
00:24:33,905 --> 00:24:36,066
we'll see
what the man's selling.

274
00:24:36,107 --> 00:24:38,803
- Then we shoot him.
- Good plan.

275
00:24:45,283 --> 00:24:47,251
Whew!

276
00:24:47,285 --> 00:24:49,981
Due to the...

277
00:24:50,021 --> 00:24:52,854
unsettling nature
of our previous encounters...

278
00:24:52,891 --> 00:24:55,758
I took it upon myself to search
the world over for that...

279
00:24:55,794 --> 00:24:57,853
that perfect item
that'd be just right

280
00:24:57,896 --> 00:25:00,626
for two exuberant sportsmen
such as yourselves.

281
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:01,723
And boys,

282
00:25:01,766 --> 00:25:04,564
well, I do believe
I found it.

283
00:25:06,705 --> 00:25:08,104
<i>Voilà!</i>

284
00:25:13,144 --> 00:25:14,406
What is it?

285
00:25:15,714 --> 00:25:17,807
Well, that right there
is the sport of kings.

286
00:25:17,849 --> 00:25:20,113
Up till now, only heads of state
have been able to afford

287
00:25:20,151 --> 00:25:21,641
a fine piece
of equipment like that,

288
00:25:21,686 --> 00:25:24,018
and it is so simple to operate
even this child could do it.

289
00:25:24,055 --> 00:25:25,522
Really?

290
00:25:25,557 --> 00:25:27,889
Here.
I'll tell you what...

291
00:25:27,926 --> 00:25:30,827
you step right up here and chunk
that lever back on my signal, okay?

292
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:35,990
Go ahead.

293
00:25:40,338 --> 00:25:41,600
Wow!

294
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,165
<i>The most powerful one</i>
<i>on the market,</i>

295
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,006
and very reasonably priced,
I might add.

296
00:25:46,044 --> 00:25:49,605
Well, that is the biggest waste of money
I have ever seen in my entire life.

297
00:25:49,648 --> 00:25:52,515
Mister, you load up that contraption
and get the hell off this land.

298
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,348
We'll take it.

299
00:25:54,386 --> 00:25:56,115
Oh no, you don't!

300
00:25:56,154 --> 00:25:58,520
I won't have my children
around this gun foolishness.

301
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,286
Then leave!

302
00:26:01,526 --> 00:26:06,327
- Come on, Daddy, let's go.
- Come on. Come on.

303
00:26:06,364 --> 00:26:08,332
You know what happens
when my feelings get hurt.

304
00:26:08,366 --> 00:26:09,560
Get in the car.
Get in the car.

305
00:26:09,601 --> 00:26:11,330
¤ <i>Ah, ha</i> ¤

306
00:26:24,449 --> 00:26:28,385
¤ <i>Oh, suey!</i> ¤

307
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:31,746
Pull!

308
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:36,286
<i>Pull!</i>

309
00:26:39,197 --> 00:26:41,256
Pull!

310
00:27:12,430 --> 00:27:16,764
- Uncle Hub?
- Don't. I tried to wake him once.

311
00:27:16,801 --> 00:27:18,962
He nearly tore
my head off.

312
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:21,199
Leave him
for a few minutes.

313
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:26,442
What are you doing
out here so late?

314
00:27:28,980 --> 00:27:30,971
What's wrong with him?

315
00:27:31,016 --> 00:27:33,348
Well, a man's body
may grow old,

316
00:27:33,385 --> 00:27:38,448
but inside his spirit can still be
as young and restless as ever.

317
00:27:39,524 --> 00:27:41,549
And him...

318
00:27:41,593 --> 00:27:44,426
in his day,
he had more spirit

319
00:27:44,462 --> 00:27:46,657
than 20 men.

320
00:27:49,768 --> 00:27:51,736
It looks like...

321
00:27:52,771 --> 00:27:54,261
he's looking
for something.

322
00:27:54,305 --> 00:27:56,830
- Mm-hmm.
- What?

323
00:28:00,578 --> 00:28:02,910
He's looking for her.

324
00:28:10,455 --> 00:28:12,082
Who?

325
00:28:12,123 --> 00:28:14,091
What was her name?

326
00:28:15,160 --> 00:28:16,923
Jasmine.

327
00:28:22,600 --> 00:28:24,591
Okay, tell me.

328
00:28:27,105 --> 00:28:29,938
You want me
to tell you the story?

329
00:28:29,974 --> 00:28:32,135
Now?

330
00:28:32,177 --> 00:28:34,475
That would take days.

331
00:28:39,818 --> 00:28:42,116
Well, uh...

332
00:28:43,354 --> 00:28:46,790
Hub was always
too restless for Texas.

333
00:28:46,825 --> 00:28:49,919
He convinced our folks

334
00:28:49,961 --> 00:28:52,156
that he needed to go
to Europe,

335
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:53,994
and I needed
to come along.

336
00:28:55,400 --> 00:28:59,336
That was
the summer of 1914.

337
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:30,894
I la-like you.

338
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:35,133
Extra, extra!
Germany invades!

339
00:29:35,173 --> 00:29:38,199
<i>Unfortunately,</i>
<i>just as we arrived in France,</i>

340
00:29:38,243 --> 00:29:43,647
so did the Kaiser
and the entire German Army.

341
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:45,512
<i>I wanted to go home,</i>

342
00:29:45,550 --> 00:29:49,486
<i>but Hub said we should tour Europe</i>
<i>one step ahead of the Germans</i>.

343
00:29:49,521 --> 00:29:53,617
<i>And we did</i>.
<i>What a time that was</i>.

344
00:29:55,126 --> 00:30:00,291
There were these girls
in Toulon... twins. And they...

345
00:30:03,234 --> 00:30:05,668
...anyway,

346
00:30:05,703 --> 00:30:09,730
we eventually wound up
in Marseilles

347
00:30:09,774 --> 00:30:12,868
with passage booked
on the last ship out of Europe.

348
00:30:12,911 --> 00:30:17,575
And Hub, he decided
that we should spend our last night

349
00:30:17,615 --> 00:30:20,607
enjoying
the local nightlife.

350
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:28,251
Three, three!

351
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:32,157
<i>He made friends</i>
<i>with these soldiers,</i>

352
00:30:33,832 --> 00:30:38,929
<i>and they bought us some drinks...</i>
<i>strong, strange drinks</i>.

353
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:43,405
<i>We woke up on a ship</i>

354
00:30:43,441 --> 00:30:47,844
<i>bound for North Africa...</i>
<i>shanghaied</i>.

355
00:30:47,879 --> 00:30:50,074
- Shanghaied?
- Yeah.

356
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:54,414
<i>We found ourselves</i>
<i>in the French Foreign Legion</i>.

357
00:30:54,452 --> 00:30:58,081
<i>"It's all my fault," Hub said,</i>
<i>but he told me not to worry</i>.

358
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:01,148
<i>He'd make sure</i>
<i>nothing happened to me</i>.

359
00:31:09,500 --> 00:31:12,526
<i>We fought many battles</i>
<i>against overwhelming odds</i>.

360
00:31:15,139 --> 00:31:17,767
<i>He saved my life</i>
<i>countless times</i>.

361
00:31:33,591 --> 00:31:37,288
<i>When the war was over,</i>
<i>we both went our separate ways</i>.

362
00:31:37,328 --> 00:31:39,888
I ended up
leading safaris

363
00:31:39,931 --> 00:31:44,368
mostly for writers
and Hollywood folk.

364
00:31:44,402 --> 00:31:46,563
But that was
too tame for Hub.

365
00:31:50,275 --> 00:31:54,143
<i>He got commissions from the new</i>
<i>North African governments,</i>

366
00:31:54,178 --> 00:31:56,476
<i>to put an end</i>
<i>to the slave trade</i>.

367
00:32:01,352 --> 00:32:04,185
<i>No one,</i>
<i>slave trader or Bedouin,</i>

368
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:08,420
<i>had ever seen anything</i>
<i>like this mad American</i>

369
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:10,723
who fought like 20 men.

370
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:16,328
<i>Hey!</i>

371
00:32:16,367 --> 00:32:19,530
What the hell are you two doing
out here in the middle of the night?

372
00:32:20,672 --> 00:32:22,731
Just enjoying
the cool night air.

373
00:32:24,909 --> 00:32:27,400
Either one of you
got a lick of sense,

374
00:32:27,445 --> 00:32:29,379
go to bed.

375
00:33:09,487 --> 00:33:13,753
¤ <i>I'm a rolling stone</i>
<i>from Texas</i> ¤

376
00:33:13,791 --> 00:33:16,851
¤ <i>Rolling stones</i>
<i>from the plains</i> ¤

377
00:33:16,894 --> 00:33:20,887
¤ <i>I am a rolling stone</i>
<i>from Texas, boys</i> ¤

378
00:33:20,932 --> 00:33:24,368
¤ <i>I long to be</i>
<i>back there again</i> ¤

379
00:33:24,402 --> 00:33:28,065
¤ <i>Well, say,</i>
<i>are you from Texas?</i> ¤

380
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:31,667
¤ <i>That's what</i>
<i>I'm wanting to know</i> ¤

381
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:35,475
¤ <i>'Cause if we're both</i>
<i>from Texas, boys</i> ¤

382
00:33:35,513 --> 00:33:38,812
¤ <i>Let's bundle up</i>
<i>our clothes and go</i>... ¤

383
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,862
<i>"Dear Walter,</i>

384
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,427
<i>how are you?</i>
<i>Found your uncles' money yet?</i>

385
00:34:32,470 --> 00:34:34,802
<i>Here I am at school</i>
<i>in Fort Worth,</i>

386
00:34:34,839 --> 00:34:37,103
<i>my nose to the court</i>
<i>reporting grind</i>... <i>"</i>

387
00:34:42,246 --> 00:34:45,443
Damn it, brother, I'm not going
anywhere looking like this.

388
00:34:49,420 --> 00:34:51,547
Look like a damn
sharecropper.

389
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:55,286
We're gardeners.
This is what gardeners wear.

390
00:34:55,326 --> 00:34:58,124
I bought you some clothes too.
They're in your room.

391
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:05,597
Think how good all these vegetables
are gonna taste.

392
00:35:05,636 --> 00:35:09,072
Peas, beans,

393
00:35:09,107 --> 00:35:12,634
<i>squash, tomatoes</i>.

394
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:14,907
- <i>Yeah</i>.
- What's this row?

395
00:35:16,614 --> 00:35:19,276
- Beets.
- Beets?

396
00:35:23,321 --> 00:35:24,583
And what about
this row?

397
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,113
- Potatoes.
- Potatoes?

398
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:28,284
<i>Yeah</i>.

399
00:35:30,962 --> 00:35:32,953
Wait one damn
minute here.

400
00:35:32,997 --> 00:35:36,125
- What's this row here?
- Tomatoes.

401
00:35:36,167 --> 00:35:38,761
- Tomatoes?
- Yeah.

402
00:35:38,803 --> 00:35:40,896
That's lettuce, squash,

403
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:45,136
sweet potatoes,
carrots, bok choy.

404
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:48,634
- Bok Choy? What is that?
- Chinese cabbage.

405
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:51,815
Hey, that row
looks right.

406
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:53,316
Yeah, well,
this is corn!

407
00:35:53,351 --> 00:35:56,809
All those seeds did look alike,
come to think of it.

408
00:35:56,854 --> 00:35:59,379
- Yeah, like corn.
- <i>Boy</i>...

409
00:35:59,423 --> 00:36:01,789
that seed salesman
sure saw us coming.

410
00:36:01,826 --> 00:36:03,054
No, saw you coming.

411
00:36:03,094 --> 00:36:06,291
<i>Corn, corn, corn!</i>

412
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:08,298
Nothing but corn.

413
00:36:09,500 --> 00:36:12,298
Corn. Corn.

414
00:36:14,338 --> 00:36:17,501
- By God, it's here!
- Kid, help him unload.

415
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:19,032
We'll be right back.

416
00:37:06,657 --> 00:37:09,558
Careful, kid.
He's a man-eater.

417
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:15,624
Is this the McCann place?
We brought your lion.

418
00:37:16,867 --> 00:37:21,861
King of the beasts.
Terror of the jungle.

419
00:37:35,686 --> 00:37:38,985
You bought a lion?
A used lion?

420
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:41,890
Stand back, kid, you don't want
to get mauled and eaten.

421
00:37:42,927 --> 00:37:44,417
- What are you doing?
- Brother,

422
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:47,226
this is the best idea
you ever had.

423
00:37:47,265 --> 00:37:50,530
This lion head will sure look good
hanging over our fireplace.

424
00:37:50,568 --> 00:37:53,230
What fireplace?
You don't have a fireplace.

425
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,171
We'll buy one.

426
00:37:56,607 --> 00:37:57,904
You're gonna shoot it?

427
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,842
Well, be seeing you.

428
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:04,045
He's in there, all right.

429
00:38:04,081 --> 00:38:06,174
I don't think this is
very sporting.

430
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:10,347
Kid, at our age,
this is as sporting as we get.

431
00:38:10,388 --> 00:38:12,515
Walter, come here.

432
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:15,116
When I give the word,
pull this.

433
00:38:21,666 --> 00:38:23,031
Pull!

434
00:38:32,343 --> 00:38:34,903
Hey.

435
00:38:34,945 --> 00:38:36,105
Come on out of there.

436
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:39,605
Hey, you
in the crate!

437
00:38:39,650 --> 00:38:43,086
<i>Get your lion butt</i>
<i>out of there</i>.

438
00:38:43,120 --> 00:38:44,644
Looks awful tame.

439
00:38:47,692 --> 00:38:50,092
This lion's no good.

440
00:38:50,127 --> 00:38:54,223
It's...
it's defective.

441
00:38:54,265 --> 00:38:58,599
- It's alive, that's the main thing.
- Go ahead and shoot it then.

442
00:38:58,636 --> 00:39:01,605
No, it wouldn't be sporting,
shooting it inside a crate.

443
00:39:01,639 --> 00:39:04,005
<i>Looks kind of old</i>...

444
00:39:04,041 --> 00:39:05,599
worn-out looking.

445
00:39:05,643 --> 00:39:08,510
Some kind of lion hunt
this is.

446
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:11,310
Perfect.
A reject.

447
00:39:11,349 --> 00:39:14,079
Some sick
zoo castoff.

448
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:19,620
So can I keep him?

449
00:39:19,657 --> 00:39:23,252
<i>I'll look after him and take care</i>
<i>of him and feed him and everything!</i>

450
00:39:23,294 --> 00:39:24,989
I never had a pet
of my very own before.

451
00:39:25,029 --> 00:39:28,965
So kid, you want to take care of it,
nurse it back to health?

452
00:39:28,999 --> 00:39:31,866
Good.
Then we shoot it.

453
00:39:38,642 --> 00:39:40,940
That's some lion
you bought.

454
00:39:40,978 --> 00:39:43,469
That's some garden seeds
you bought.

455
00:39:46,450 --> 00:39:50,409
Don't worry, they're not as bad
as they seem right at first.

456
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:53,480
I'll be right back
with supper.

457
00:40:03,901 --> 00:40:07,359
There.
Now you can see out.

458
00:40:12,209 --> 00:40:14,177
You sure
he can't get out?

459
00:40:15,413 --> 00:40:17,847
She.
It's a girl lion.

460
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:21,083
I named her Jasmine.

461
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:24,488
What did you just say?

462
00:40:30,661 --> 00:40:34,188
It seemed like a good name...
for a lion.

463
00:40:48,312 --> 00:40:50,507
I'm sorry it took
awhile to come in.

464
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:53,108
In 40 years, I never had
a call for it.

465
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:58,648
"Purina Lion Chow."

466
00:40:58,689 --> 00:41:00,850
I'll be!

467
00:41:00,891 --> 00:41:03,155
If you wait a few minutes,
my boys will load you up.

468
00:41:04,395 --> 00:41:06,386
I got it.

469
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:10,123
Garth, pay the man.

470
00:41:10,167 --> 00:41:11,600
Be careful.

471
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:16,166
Mr. McCann, those are bags
that weigh 50 pounds a piece.

472
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:21,534
Take the other end.

473
00:41:21,579 --> 00:41:23,774
Here we go.

474
00:41:35,226 --> 00:41:37,854
If you two old ladies want
to get in, I'll take you home now.

475
00:41:42,333 --> 00:41:44,130
Hub!

476
00:42:02,319 --> 00:42:03,809
Psst!

477
00:42:05,055 --> 00:42:06,044
Psst!

478
00:42:07,091 --> 00:42:09,423
Little boy!

479
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:11,826
You're with those
McCann brothers?

480
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:20,627
I know that they're
ex-mafia hit men.

481
00:42:20,671 --> 00:42:23,765
They're on the run
with millions

482
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:27,436
that they stole
from Al Capone.

483
00:42:45,696 --> 00:42:47,288
Tell me more
about Africa...

484
00:42:47,331 --> 00:42:50,698
about you and Uncle Hub
and Jasmine.

485
00:42:50,734 --> 00:42:53,862
Why would a smart kid like you
want to hear hokey old stories?

486
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,965
What else
do we have to do?

487
00:42:59,076 --> 00:43:00,543
Where was I?

488
00:43:03,147 --> 00:43:07,311
"No one, slave trader
or Bedouin,

489
00:43:07,351 --> 00:43:09,876
<i>had ever seen anything</i>
<i>like this mad American</i>

490
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,615
<i>who fought</i>
<i>like 20 men. "</i>

491
00:43:11,655 --> 00:43:14,419
Yeah right, right, right.
Well, it so happened...

492
00:43:15,526 --> 00:43:18,017
<i>one of the women</i>
<i>that Hub freed</i>

493
00:43:18,062 --> 00:43:20,690
<i>was handmaiden</i>
<i>to a princess</i>.

494
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:28,360
<i>When she told her mistress</i>
<i>the story of her rescue,</i>

495
00:43:28,405 --> 00:43:33,604
<i>most of all, she told her about</i>
<i>the handsome, heroic American</i>.

496
00:43:35,145 --> 00:43:39,013
<i>"I must meet this man!"</i>
<i>The princess said</i>.

497
00:43:42,086 --> 00:43:47,183
<i>One day, Hub was riding his horse</i>
<i>along the Mediterranean,</i>

498
00:43:47,224 --> 00:43:51,718
<i>when out of nowhere,</i>
<i>another rider came up alongside</i>.

499
00:43:54,198 --> 00:43:57,861
<i>But you know Hub... he wasn't</i>
<i>about to let a chance pass</i>.

500
00:43:57,901 --> 00:43:59,630
<i>It became a race</i>.

501
00:44:03,741 --> 00:44:08,303
<i>Most people say that Hub</i>
<i>was the best rider in North Africa</i>.

502
00:44:10,180 --> 00:44:12,876
<i>But this other rider</i>
<i>kept neck and neck</i>

503
00:44:12,916 --> 00:44:16,374
<i>as the race went</i>
<i>on and on</i>.

504
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:25,824
Then the two horses
collided.

505
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:28,832
<i>The riders went flying</i>
<i>into the sea</i>.

506
00:44:28,866 --> 00:44:32,199
<i>Hub leaped to his feet</i>
<i>ready for anything...</i>

507
00:44:32,236 --> 00:44:34,261
<i>or so he thought</i>.

508
00:44:44,748 --> 00:44:47,740
<i>This was the princess,</i>

509
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:51,653
<i>the most beautiful woman</i>
<i>he had ever seen</i>.

510
00:44:54,291 --> 00:44:58,125
- <i>Jasmine!</i>
<i>- Jasmine</i>.

511
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:08,070
<i>Many people say there's</i>
<i>no such thing nowadays,</i>

512
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:10,596
<i>it's something</i>
<i>you only find in stories,</i>

513
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:14,771
<i>but when these two set eyes</i>
<i>on each other for the first time,</i>

514
00:45:14,812 --> 00:45:18,543
<i>this was honest to god,</i>
<i>no kidding, sure enough,</i>

515
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:20,573
<i>once in a lifetime,</i>

516
00:45:20,617 --> 00:45:24,246
<i>love at first sight</i>.

517
00:45:30,928 --> 00:45:34,329
Wait a minute.
If it was true love

518
00:45:34,364 --> 00:45:36,832
they would've been married
and lived happily ever after, right?

519
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:39,028
Aren't you getting ahead
of the story?

520
00:45:40,738 --> 00:45:43,673
- Okay, keep going.
- Well...

521
00:45:43,707 --> 00:45:46,835
<i>things weren't easy</i>
<i>for them back then</i>.

522
00:45:46,877 --> 00:45:49,072
<i>She was promised</i>
<i>to another man,</i>

523
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:52,139
<i>a powerful sheik</i>
<i>in a neighboring kingdom</i>.

524
00:45:55,652 --> 00:45:59,486
<i>He heard that Jasmine</i>
<i>was in love with another,</i>

525
00:45:59,523 --> 00:46:01,684
<i>so he threatened</i>
<i>her father,</i>

526
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:04,125
<i>and took Jasmine off</i>
<i>to his kingdom</i>

527
00:46:04,161 --> 00:46:06,755
<i>and locked her up</i>
<i>in his harem</i>.

528
00:46:08,532 --> 00:46:12,696
<i>She told the other wives</i>
<i>that she would rather die</i>

529
00:46:12,736 --> 00:46:15,296
<i>than marry</i>
<i>this heartless sheik</i>.

530
00:46:15,339 --> 00:46:17,739
<i>She had a knife on her</i>.

531
00:46:18,742 --> 00:46:20,903
<i>And when he came for her</i>
<i>that night,</i>

532
00:46:20,944 --> 00:46:23,344
she was going
to slit her own throat.

533
00:46:24,548 --> 00:46:26,641
What did
Uncle Hub do?

534
00:47:01,151 --> 00:47:05,554
<i>They got married,</i>
<i>and lived happily ever after</i>.

535
00:47:05,589 --> 00:47:07,216
The end.

536
00:47:09,793 --> 00:47:11,852
But wait,

537
00:47:11,895 --> 00:47:13,556
if they lived
happily ever after,

538
00:47:13,597 --> 00:47:17,328
then they got married, and she'd
be here right now with us, right?

539
00:47:17,367 --> 00:47:19,562
Didn't they have kids?
Where are they?

540
00:47:19,603 --> 00:47:22,197
Nurse?
What's going on?

541
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:25,635
I wish they'd tell us
something.

542
00:47:29,847 --> 00:47:31,838
<i>Get out of my face!</i>

543
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:35,340
<i>Where'd you put my damn pants?</i>
<i>Where's my pants?</i>

544
00:47:35,385 --> 00:47:39,549
- You can't do that!
- Gimme my pants!

545
00:47:39,590 --> 00:47:43,321
Who put me in here?
Who put me in here? You two!

546
00:47:46,897 --> 00:47:49,263
Hospitals...
lot of good they are.

547
00:47:49,299 --> 00:47:53,099
How would you know? You're never
in one long enough to find out.

548
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:56,968
Hey, you missed
the turn.

549
00:47:57,007 --> 00:47:59,373
- I did not.
- Home is that way.

550
00:47:59,409 --> 00:48:01,309
I wanna go this way.

551
00:48:11,555 --> 00:48:15,457
Doctor,
where is Mr. McCann?

552
00:48:15,492 --> 00:48:18,620
Oh, I'm afraid
he's gone.

553
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:27,227
Well, he led
a long full life.

554
00:48:27,271 --> 00:48:29,296
Where is the body?

555
00:48:29,339 --> 00:48:32,706
No, he's gone... left.

556
00:48:32,743 --> 00:48:34,904
Mr. McCann checked
himself out.

557
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:36,845
Left?!

558
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:41,883
Brother,

559
00:48:41,919 --> 00:48:46,219
someday you're gonna have
to start acting your age.

560
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,690
What the hell
does that mean?

561
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:51,990
All your life, you've never been
frightened of anything.

562
00:48:52,029 --> 00:48:54,327
So what's eating
at you now?

563
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:56,628
Getting old?

564
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:59,329
- Dying?
- Hell no.

565
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:03,539
- What then?
- Being useless.

566
00:49:03,573 --> 00:49:06,041
<i>When we were young</i>
<i>there was always a reason,</i>

567
00:49:06,076 --> 00:49:08,340
there was a point.
Things made sense.

568
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:10,175
<i>Now there's</i>
<i>no point to anything</i>.

569
00:49:10,213 --> 00:49:11,680
So what do we do?
We garden.

570
00:49:11,715 --> 00:49:14,912
We outlived our time,
brother.

571
00:49:27,497 --> 00:49:29,931
- <i>Go get some beers</i>.
<i>- All right</i>.

572
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:32,959
Hey, old man,

573
00:49:33,003 --> 00:49:35,028
how's that barbecue?

574
00:49:35,072 --> 00:49:37,506
Give me some.

575
00:49:37,541 --> 00:49:40,977
We're busy, boy.
Get lost, all right?

576
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:44,475
<i>What did you say?</i>

577
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:48,109
Here's a perfect example
of what I've been talking about.

578
00:49:48,151 --> 00:49:50,585
Since this boy was suckling on
his momma's tit,

579
00:49:50,620 --> 00:49:52,781
he's been given
everything but discipline.

580
00:49:52,823 --> 00:49:54,882
<i>And now his idea</i>
<i>of courage and manhood</i>

581
00:49:54,925 --> 00:49:56,916
is to get together with
a bunch of punk friends

582
00:49:56,960 --> 00:49:58,985
and ride around
irritating folks...

583
00:49:59,029 --> 00:50:02,260
too good natured
to put a stop to it.

584
00:50:04,001 --> 00:50:06,128
Hey, who do you
think you are, huh?

585
00:50:07,938 --> 00:50:08,962
Just a dumb kid, Hub.

586
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,132
- Don't kill him.
- Right.

587
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:16,077
I'm Hub McCann.

588
00:50:16,113 --> 00:50:17,171
I fought in two World Wars

589
00:50:17,214 --> 00:50:19,375
and countless smaller ones
on three continents.

590
00:50:19,416 --> 00:50:21,543
I led thousands of men
into battle with everything

591
00:50:21,585 --> 00:50:24,110
from horses and swords
to artillery and tanks.

592
00:50:24,154 --> 00:50:26,247
I've seen the headwaters
of the Nile,

593
00:50:26,289 --> 00:50:29,190
and tribes of natives no white man
had ever seen before.

594
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:31,456
I've won and lost
a dozen fortunes,

595
00:50:31,495 --> 00:50:33,326
killed many men

596
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,524
and loved
only one woman

597
00:50:35,565 --> 00:50:37,328
with a passion
a <i>flea</i> like you

598
00:50:37,367 --> 00:50:38,994
could never begin
to understand.

599
00:50:39,036 --> 00:50:40,765
That's who I am.

600
00:50:42,339 --> 00:50:44,807
Now, go home, boy!

601
00:50:46,243 --> 00:50:48,211
We'll show these
old bastards who's tough!

602
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:49,837
- <i>Get out your knife</i>.
<i>- Yeah</i>.

603
00:50:52,849 --> 00:50:54,840
Now, boys,

604
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,251
you're fixing to let
those teenage hormones

605
00:50:57,287 --> 00:50:58,720
get you into a world
of trouble.

606
00:51:00,424 --> 00:51:02,392
Damn it, Garth.
Did I ask you to butt in?

607
00:51:02,426 --> 00:51:04,291
Hub, you just
come out of the hospital.

608
00:51:04,327 --> 00:51:07,819
Well, there's...
there's only four of 'em.

609
00:51:07,864 --> 00:51:10,196
Yeah, but...
look, you fight this one first.

610
00:51:10,233 --> 00:51:13,862
And then I'll let you fight
the other three after, okay?

611
00:51:13,904 --> 00:51:16,134
Yeah.
Watch this, kid!

612
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:18,835
Now you!
You better pick that knife up,

613
00:51:18,875 --> 00:51:23,471
'cause, son, you're gonna need
all the help you can get.

614
00:51:25,082 --> 00:51:26,606
- Come on, Frankie!
- Get him.

615
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:29,016
Get him, Frankie, cut him!

616
00:51:31,421 --> 00:51:33,048
Ahh!

617
00:51:33,090 --> 00:51:35,558
Shoot, oldest trick
in the book.

618
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,560
Okay, okay.

619
00:51:37,594 --> 00:51:39,824
You hold it wrong, son.
Not like this.

620
00:51:39,863 --> 00:51:41,990
You always
do it like this... smooth.

621
00:51:42,032 --> 00:51:44,023
- Try it again.
- <i>Come on, Frankie</i>.

622
00:51:44,067 --> 00:51:45,466
Come on, Frankie,
get him!

623
00:51:45,502 --> 00:51:47,561
- Cut him
- Come on. Okay.

624
00:51:47,604 --> 00:51:49,834
- Get him, Frankie, cut him.
- Yeah, you got him!

625
00:51:49,873 --> 00:51:50,862
Frankie, come on!

626
00:51:55,879 --> 00:51:58,143
- Stop, stop, ahh!
- You're breaking his arm!

627
00:51:58,181 --> 00:52:00,206
You three had better
get in there and help him.

628
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:16,826
Why aren't you
helping him?

629
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:20,963
Hub always hogs the bad guys.
He's selfish that way.

630
00:52:22,038 --> 00:52:24,233
But there's
four of them!

631
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:26,765
Three of them.

632
00:52:29,179 --> 00:52:33,946
Go on, Hub!
Hey, there's my boy!

633
00:52:33,984 --> 00:52:36,043
Like this, kid?
Pretty good, huh?

634
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:38,452
- Couldn't you share?
- Nah.

635
00:52:38,488 --> 00:52:40,649
After 40 years,
I'm used to it.

636
00:52:40,690 --> 00:52:42,783
Ahhh!

637
00:52:42,826 --> 00:52:47,058
Besides, right now, I figure
he needs them worse than I do.

638
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,157
Go on, Hub!

639
00:52:51,201 --> 00:52:53,226
This'll hold him though.
This'll hold him.

640
00:52:53,270 --> 00:52:54,294
Please! Please!

641
00:53:10,554 --> 00:53:12,146
They're not back yet, Daddy.

642
00:53:12,189 --> 00:53:14,749
I'm sure with Hub
just out of the hospital,

643
00:53:14,791 --> 00:53:16,986
they're taking it slow
and easy on the way home.

644
00:53:17,027 --> 00:53:18,016
Yeah.

645
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:21,563
Oh, I hate this house.
I hate it.

646
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:23,190
<i>When those two finally</i>
<i>drop dead,</i>

647
00:53:23,233 --> 00:53:25,463
<i>I want you to burn this place</i>
<i>to the ground, Daddy</i>.

648
00:53:25,502 --> 00:53:28,335
Hey, what's that?

649
00:53:28,371 --> 00:53:30,362
<i>Beats me</i>.

650
00:53:30,407 --> 00:53:34,173
- Let's tear it up!
- Yeah.

651
00:53:42,118 --> 00:53:43,107
What is it?

652
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:45,678
It's stuffed!

653
00:53:48,792 --> 00:53:51,693
- Mom!
- Mom!

654
00:54:02,339 --> 00:54:05,570
- He's alive!
- What? What happened?

655
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:07,839
I told you about
those lies of yours. No!

656
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:13,042
Hey, don't step on my shoes!

657
00:54:13,083 --> 00:54:14,846
What have you done
with Uncle Hub?

658
00:54:14,884 --> 00:54:18,479
Kid, get some meat.

659
00:54:18,521 --> 00:54:20,182
Where's Uncle Hub?

660
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:24,352
Oh, Lord, there's
been an accident.

661
00:54:25,695 --> 00:54:27,993
I wanna go home now.

662
00:54:28,031 --> 00:54:29,931
You're in no shape
to go home now.

663
00:54:29,966 --> 00:54:32,264
It was a fight. Uncle Hub won.
It was great.

664
00:54:32,302 --> 00:54:34,736
- Ahh!
- The lion really did try to eat us.

665
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:37,604
- <i>Shush</i>.
- Jasmine?

666
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:40,337
Oh Jasmine!
I haven't fed her all day.

667
00:54:40,377 --> 00:54:42,845
<i>I bet she's really hungry</i>.
<i>I got to go feed her</i>.

668
00:54:42,879 --> 00:54:45,177
Here, here!

669
00:54:50,754 --> 00:54:52,745
Here you go,
Jasmine.

670
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,521
Jasmine?

671
00:55:02,465 --> 00:55:05,901
- There really is a lion.
- Lion?! You got a lion?

672
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:09,371
- It's locked up.
- No it isn't. It tried to eat us.

673
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:11,874
- It really tried to eat us.
- Get the guns!

674
00:55:11,908 --> 00:55:13,671
- Get out of the way.
- Get the guns.

675
00:55:13,710 --> 00:55:15,575
Come here,
come here.

676
00:55:15,612 --> 00:55:17,580
Jasmine?

677
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:29,891
Jasmine? Jasmine?
Jasmine?

678
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:32,053
Come on. Oh!

679
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:38,765
Eew, lion spit. No, stop.

680
00:55:38,802 --> 00:55:41,828
Don't shoot,
you'll hit him.

681
00:55:41,871 --> 00:55:43,896
Come on.
Whoa!

682
00:55:49,179 --> 00:55:51,170
They're gone.

683
00:55:51,214 --> 00:55:53,876
- We might be too late.
- Move in.

684
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:57,615
You stay. Stay.

685
00:56:09,699 --> 00:56:11,564
<i>Jasmine!</i>

686
00:56:12,836 --> 00:56:15,703
Stop, stop.

687
00:56:17,607 --> 00:56:18,596
Attack him!

688
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:29,450
She's feeling
a lot better.

689
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:34,623
Get off of me!

690
00:56:35,859 --> 00:56:37,588
We're leaving.

691
00:56:39,028 --> 00:56:42,122
We are not coming back
until you get rid of that monster.

692
00:56:43,967 --> 00:56:47,232
Well, the lion stays.

693
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:51,029
All right, that's it.
Come on, Daddy.

694
00:56:51,074 --> 00:56:52,132
<i>Daddy! Come on!</i>

695
00:56:52,175 --> 00:56:54,370
<i>Bye, Uncle Hub</i>.
<i>Bye, Uncle Garth!</i>

696
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,971
Shut up.
Get in the car.

697
00:56:57,013 --> 00:56:59,345
<i>I need a drink bad</i>.
<i>I'm having a bad day</i>.

698
00:56:59,382 --> 00:57:02,180
You boys hungry?

699
00:57:02,218 --> 00:57:05,483
- Wanna stay for supper?
- What are we gonna eat?

700
00:57:05,522 --> 00:57:07,183
Meat.

701
00:57:07,223 --> 00:57:09,054
A lotta meat.

702
00:57:10,226 --> 00:57:12,319
She won't come
out of the cornfield.

703
00:57:12,362 --> 00:57:16,025
This cornfield's the closest thing
to a jungle she's ever seen.

704
00:57:16,065 --> 00:57:18,863
<i>She knows this is where</i>
<i>she belongs</i>.

705
00:57:27,510 --> 00:57:30,377
- I think she's happy.
- I think she is.

706
00:57:34,017 --> 00:57:36,781
What about you?
You happy?

707
00:57:49,933 --> 00:57:52,925
<i>What's he saying to them?</i>

708
00:57:52,969 --> 00:57:55,233
He's giving them his
"What every boy needs to know

709
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:56,863
about being a man" speech.

710
00:57:58,575 --> 00:58:01,601
A lot of men have heard
that speech over the years.

711
00:58:01,644 --> 00:58:04,738
<i>A lot of men</i>.

712
00:58:04,781 --> 00:58:08,273
- Will he give that speech to me?
- <i>Oh, I guarantee it</i>.

713
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,912
Assuming he's still around,
of course.

714
00:58:15,992 --> 00:58:19,018
Hey, you didn't finish that story
about Uncle Hub and Jasmine.

715
00:58:19,062 --> 00:58:20,723
You don't believe
all this Africa stuff?

716
00:58:20,763 --> 00:58:22,094
It's a good story.

717
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:28,033
Well, after he
rescued Jasmine,

718
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:31,700
several years passed,
wonderful years.

719
00:58:34,677 --> 00:58:37,168
<i>Never were two people</i>
<i>so happy,</i>

720
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:39,272
<i>so in love</i>.

721
00:58:39,315 --> 00:58:42,250
<i>It was perfect</i>.

722
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:45,186
<i>Except for one thing</i>.

723
00:58:45,221 --> 00:58:47,985
- The sheik.
- The sheik.

724
00:58:49,192 --> 00:58:51,990
<i>He hated Hub</i>
<i>for stealing Jasmine,</i>

725
00:58:52,028 --> 00:58:54,690
<i>so he put a price</i>
<i>on Hub's head</i>.

726
00:58:54,731 --> 00:58:59,191
<i>10,000 pieces of gold...</i>
<i>a fortune</i>.

727
00:58:59,235 --> 00:59:02,932
<i>Assassins came</i>
<i>from miles around</i>.

728
00:59:16,753 --> 00:59:18,243
Come on!

729
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:19,846
<i>He and Jasmine had</i>
<i>to be on guard</i>

730
00:59:19,889 --> 00:59:22,653
<i>every minute</i>
<i>of every day</i>.

731
00:59:44,113 --> 00:59:47,173
<i>Hub knew he and Jasmine</i>
<i>couldn't run forever,</i>

732
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:50,515
<i>that sooner or later</i>
<i>their luck would run out</i>.

733
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:56,055
<i>There was only</i>
<i>one thing to do</i>.

734
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:04,932
<i>So one day an assassin led Hub,</i>
<i>bound in chains,</i>

735
01:00:04,968 --> 01:00:06,902
<i>into the sheik's</i>
<i>fortress</i>

736
01:00:06,936 --> 01:00:09,632
<i>to claim his 10,000</i>
<i>pieces of gold</i>.

737
01:00:09,672 --> 01:00:11,162
What?!

738
01:00:13,076 --> 01:00:16,603
<i>They gave the assassin</i>
<i>bags and bags of gold</i>

739
01:00:16,646 --> 01:00:18,238
<i>as the sheik</i>
<i>ordered Hub</i>

740
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:24,447
<i>down to the notorious</i>
<i>Dungeon of 1,387 Tortures</i>.

741
01:00:27,690 --> 01:00:32,150
What kind of greedy, no-good scum
would turn in Uncle Hub for money?

742
01:00:32,195 --> 01:00:35,596
Well, I would.

743
01:00:40,069 --> 01:00:42,264
<i>Ah, it was a trick</i>.

744
01:00:42,305 --> 01:00:45,206
<i>Yeah, it was a trick</i>.

745
01:00:52,649 --> 01:00:54,378
In the dungeon,
I drew my sword...

746
01:01:04,527 --> 01:01:07,428
and single-handedly
slaughtered everyone in there

747
01:01:07,463 --> 01:01:10,159
and freed Hub
without dropping

748
01:01:10,199 --> 01:01:11,723
a single gold coin.

749
01:01:17,573 --> 01:01:19,803
<i>Wait a minute,</i>
<i>wait a minute</i>.

750
01:01:19,842 --> 01:01:21,810
You saved Uncle Hub,

751
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:24,608
all this time carrying
hundreds of pounds of gold?

752
01:01:26,149 --> 01:01:29,448
You don't believe I killed
all those men and saved Hub?

753
01:01:32,121 --> 01:01:35,682
Well, Hub might've helped
just a little.

754
01:01:53,242 --> 01:01:55,472
- Uh-oh.
<i>- We were greatly outnumbered</i>.

755
01:01:57,513 --> 01:01:59,481
<i>We fought against</i>
<i>incredible odds</i>.

756
01:01:59,515 --> 01:02:01,779
<i>And when it was over,</i>
<i>we split up</i>.

757
01:02:01,818 --> 01:02:04,446
<i>Each one knew what the other</i>
<i>had to do</i>.

758
01:02:09,425 --> 01:02:12,622
<i>High in his opulent</i>
<i>bedchamber,</i>

759
01:02:12,662 --> 01:02:14,562
<i>the sheik slept</i>.

760
01:02:16,599 --> 01:02:20,695
<i>He awoke with Hub's sword</i>
<i>across his throat</i>.

761
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:23,331
<i>The sheik was terrified,</i>

762
01:02:23,372 --> 01:02:26,637
<i>but Hub</i>
<i>just lowered his blade</i>.

763
01:02:33,216 --> 01:02:35,741
<i>"Defend yourself!"</i>
<i>Hub cried</i>.

764
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:38,379
<i>And he threw</i>
<i>the sheik a sword</i>.

765
01:03:06,415 --> 01:03:10,545
<i>The sheik knew that he would</i>
<i>surely die now,</i>

766
01:03:10,586 --> 01:03:13,146
<i>without even the right</i>
<i>to beg for mercy</i>.

767
01:03:24,467 --> 01:03:26,628
<i>But Hub just said,</i>

768
01:03:26,669 --> 01:03:31,163
<i>"Twice I have held</i>
<i>your life in my hands,</i>

769
01:03:31,207 --> 01:03:34,472
<i>and twice I have</i>
<i>given it back to you</i>.

770
01:03:34,510 --> 01:03:37,001
The next time..."

771
01:03:37,046 --> 01:03:40,209
...your life is mine.

772
01:03:48,090 --> 01:03:49,785
<i>And from that moment on,</i>

773
01:03:49,826 --> 01:03:52,590
<i>the assassination attempts</i>
<i>stopped</i>.

774
01:03:52,628 --> 01:03:55,654
<i>Some say it was</i>
<i>because the sheik</i>

775
01:03:55,698 --> 01:03:59,293
<i>was afraid that Hub</i>
<i>would return and kill him</i>.

776
01:03:59,335 --> 01:04:02,896
<i>Others said because Hub</i>
<i>had spared his life,</i>

777
01:04:02,939 --> 01:04:07,706
<i>the sheik did the honorable thing</i>
<i>and let his enemy live</i>.

778
01:04:10,646 --> 01:04:13,376
Personally,
I think it's because

779
01:04:13,416 --> 01:04:16,681
the sheik was so damn busy once they
discovered oil in his kingdom.

780
01:04:16,719 --> 01:04:19,745
He became one of the five
richest men in the world.

781
01:04:20,890 --> 01:04:24,758
What?! The bad guy
gets filthy rich?

782
01:04:25,895 --> 01:04:27,795
What the heck kind
of story ends that way?

783
01:04:27,830 --> 01:04:29,889
I just told it
the way it happened.

784
01:04:29,932 --> 01:04:31,900
- Bye.
- So long.

785
01:04:34,737 --> 01:04:36,500
So that's how you got
all your money?

786
01:04:36,539 --> 01:04:38,803
- The gold from the sheik?
- Well...

787
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:41,139
Yeah.

788
01:04:42,912 --> 01:04:45,540
Those young men'll
be okay now.

789
01:04:45,581 --> 01:04:48,573
- Will you?
- Yeah.

790
01:04:50,419 --> 01:04:53,252
I feel old and worn out.

791
01:04:53,289 --> 01:04:55,223
- You've been busy.
- Yeah.

792
01:04:55,258 --> 01:04:58,227
Terrorizing doctors
and nurses,

793
01:04:58,261 --> 01:05:02,163
beating up teenagers,
chasing after lions...

794
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:04,496
you've had a full day.

795
01:05:06,736 --> 01:05:09,762
Lucky those boys don't know
diddly-squat about fighting.

796
01:05:10,940 --> 01:05:13,534
Won't be long till the kid here
can whup my ass.

797
01:05:16,812 --> 01:05:19,212
Won't be long till I'll be
helpless in a fight.

798
01:05:19,248 --> 01:05:20,909
Useless!

799
01:05:20,950 --> 01:05:23,043
You'll feel better in a day
or two.

800
01:05:26,355 --> 01:05:28,414
Yeah, well...

801
01:05:28,457 --> 01:05:31,517
I'm going to bed.
Good night, kid.

802
01:05:48,244 --> 01:05:50,235
So...

803
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:52,907
you finally gonna tell me
what happened to Jasmine?

804
01:05:52,949 --> 01:05:54,348
- Nope.
- What?!

805
01:05:54,383 --> 01:05:56,874
You wanna know
what happened to Jasmine

806
01:05:56,919 --> 01:05:58,216
you're gonna have
to ask him.

807
01:05:59,789 --> 01:06:01,689
Ask Uncle Hub?

808
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:04,158
Are you crazy?
Look what happened last time.

809
01:06:04,193 --> 01:06:06,855
I'm tired of doing
all the dirty work around here.

810
01:06:06,896 --> 01:06:08,955
If you wanna hear
the end of this story,

811
01:06:08,998 --> 01:06:10,465
you're gonna
have to ask him.

812
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:42,756
- Hub?
- Yeah?

813
01:06:42,798 --> 01:06:45,767
- An airplane?
- Yep, always wanted one.

814
01:06:45,801 --> 01:06:48,361
You always said you'd never set foot
in an airplane.

815
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:50,998
You don't trust them
to fall right out of the sky.

816
01:06:51,040 --> 01:06:53,440
They're dangerous, all right,
plenty dangerous.

817
01:06:53,476 --> 01:06:55,876
You got a book of instructions
or something?

818
01:06:55,911 --> 01:06:57,469
Yeah, right here.

819
01:06:57,513 --> 01:07:00,277
You don't know
a damn thing about airplanes.

820
01:07:00,316 --> 01:07:02,750
Well, I'm gonna learn,
I tell you.

821
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:06,550
Aha!
It says right here,

822
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:08,318
"To climb,
pull back on the stick;

823
01:07:08,357 --> 01:07:10,450
to descend, push forward
on the stick."

824
01:07:10,493 --> 01:07:13,223
I'll have this thing up
in the air in no time.

825
01:07:13,262 --> 01:07:14,820
Whoo! Damn.

826
01:07:25,341 --> 01:07:27,832
<i>Maybe it's</i>
<i>just a new hobby</i>.

827
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:30,345
Maybe he doesn't really
mean to...

828
01:07:31,680 --> 01:07:34,376
you know,
do something crazy.

829
01:07:36,385 --> 01:07:38,182
You think so?

830
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:46,620
You ask him yet?

831
01:07:47,696 --> 01:07:49,493
<i>About Jasmine?</i>

832
01:07:53,903 --> 01:07:55,894
You'd better
make it quick.

833
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:59,434
What the hell?

834
01:08:59,468 --> 01:09:01,095
It's the middle
of the night.

835
01:09:02,671 --> 01:09:04,730
What's the matter?
What are you doing here?

836
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:07,833
<i>You got something</i>
<i>to say to me?</i>

837
01:09:07,877 --> 01:09:10,277
Spit it out.

838
01:09:12,314 --> 01:09:14,475
What happened to her,
Uncle Hub?

839
01:09:18,654 --> 01:09:20,884
What happened
to Jasmine?

840
01:09:34,036 --> 01:09:37,767
I have to know.
I have to.

841
01:09:42,244 --> 01:09:44,269
She died.

842
01:09:45,481 --> 01:09:47,745
Died in childbirth.
Her and the baby.

843
01:09:59,361 --> 01:10:01,329
What did you do?

844
01:10:04,567 --> 01:10:08,128
Went back to the only life
I knew... back to the Legion.

845
01:10:28,290 --> 01:10:32,124
<i>For the next 40 years, there was</i>
<i>always one more war to fight</i>.

846
01:10:33,896 --> 01:10:36,922
Then I got old
and came here.

847
01:10:39,835 --> 01:10:42,360
Here I am.

848
01:10:43,405 --> 01:10:45,896
Here I am.

849
01:10:45,941 --> 01:10:48,432
You cold, son?

850
01:10:48,477 --> 01:10:50,604
You'd better...
here.

851
01:10:50,646 --> 01:10:54,047
You'd better...
you'd better go inside.

852
01:10:55,150 --> 01:10:58,415
Good boy, thank you.
Good boy.

853
01:10:58,454 --> 01:11:00,888
Those stories about Africa...

854
01:11:02,791 --> 01:11:05,259
about you...

855
01:11:05,294 --> 01:11:08,058
they're true,
aren't they?

856
01:11:09,131 --> 01:11:11,964
- Doesn't matter.
- It does too.

857
01:11:13,636 --> 01:11:17,231
Around my mom all I hear is lies.
I don't know what to believe in.

858
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:19,571
If you want to believe in something,
then believe in it.

859
01:11:19,608 --> 01:11:22,941
Just because something isn't true,
no reason you can't believe in it.

860
01:11:25,314 --> 01:11:27,009
All right.

861
01:11:27,049 --> 01:11:29,074
There's a long speech
I give to young men.

862
01:11:29,118 --> 01:11:31,552
Sounds like you need
to hear a piece of it.

863
01:11:31,587 --> 01:11:33,919
Just a piece.

864
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:38,188
Sometimes the things
that may or may not be true

865
01:11:38,227 --> 01:11:41,856
are the things that a man needs
to believe in the most.

866
01:11:42,998 --> 01:11:46,161
That people are
basically good;

867
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:48,499
That honor...

868
01:11:48,537 --> 01:11:51,131
courage and virtue
mean everything;

869
01:11:52,408 --> 01:11:55,775
<i>That power and money,</i>
<i>money and power mean nothing;</i>

870
01:11:57,179 --> 01:12:00,046
That good always triumphs
over evil;

871
01:12:01,216 --> 01:12:03,810
And I want you
to remember this, that love...

872
01:12:10,626 --> 01:12:14,289
true love never dies.
You remember that, boy.

873
01:12:17,199 --> 01:12:19,429
<i>You remember that</i>.

874
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:22,699
<i>Doesn't matter if it's</i>
<i>true or not. You see,</i>

875
01:12:22,738 --> 01:12:25,332
a man should believe
in those things, because...

876
01:12:26,375 --> 01:12:29,276
those are the things
worth believing in.

877
01:12:31,013 --> 01:12:33,311
Got that?

878
01:12:34,483 --> 01:12:36,951
That was a good speech.

879
01:12:36,985 --> 01:12:39,783
Think so? Thanks.

880
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:42,222
Yeah...

881
01:12:42,257 --> 01:12:44,851
When are you gonna give me
the rest of the speech?

882
01:12:46,261 --> 01:12:48,661
When you're almost a man.

883
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:51,495
- You promise?
- Wait one minute here. Wait...

884
01:12:51,533 --> 01:12:55,264
I can't be a good man until you give me
the rest of the speech, right?

885
01:12:55,304 --> 01:12:58,501
You need to stick around until I'm
old enough to hear the whole thing.

886
01:12:58,540 --> 01:13:01,100
- I see what you're trying to pull.
- You have to stick around

887
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:03,043
- until I'm old enough...
- I'll write it down.

888
01:13:03,078 --> 01:13:05,569
No! I want <i>you</i>
to give me the speech!

889
01:13:05,614 --> 01:13:07,980
You won't be
living here then.

890
01:13:08,016 --> 01:13:11,543
You're my uncle. I need you to stick
around and be my uncle.

891
01:13:14,323 --> 01:13:16,120
<i>What about Uncle Garth?</i>

892
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:19,518
He needs you.

893
01:13:19,561 --> 01:13:22,587
W-what about the dogs
and the pig,

894
01:13:22,631 --> 01:13:25,293
and the lion?
We all need you. I need you.

895
01:13:25,334 --> 01:13:27,325
- No, you're just being silly.
- No, it's true!

896
01:13:27,369 --> 01:13:29,303
- <i>You're being silly</i>.
- It's true!

897
01:13:32,374 --> 01:13:35,468
I know you miss Jasmine
an awful, awful lot.

898
01:13:37,279 --> 01:13:39,747
But if you go,

899
01:13:40,783 --> 01:13:43,809
we'll miss you
just as much.

900
01:13:45,387 --> 01:13:47,821
It's true.

901
01:13:54,730 --> 01:13:56,857
All right, damn it,
you win.

902
01:13:56,899 --> 01:13:59,868
I'll stick around
and be your damn uncle.

903
01:13:59,902 --> 01:14:03,167
Don't expect me
to be happy about it.

904
01:14:07,943 --> 01:14:10,673
All right? Deal?

905
01:14:11,847 --> 01:14:14,213
Oh-hh!

906
01:14:15,250 --> 01:14:18,344
Ohh, ohh.

907
01:14:18,387 --> 01:14:20,287
You're a good boy.

908
01:14:23,826 --> 01:14:26,954
You're a good boy.
You're a good boy.

909
01:15:07,336 --> 01:15:09,031
Walter, Walter!

910
01:15:09,071 --> 01:15:11,096
Get ready. Walter!

911
01:17:37,419 --> 01:17:39,546
This money
look stolen to you?

912
01:18:13,855 --> 01:18:16,119
¤ <i>Try to help you</i> ¤

913
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:19,685
¤ <i>I can't do it</i>
<i>all by myself</i>... ¤

914
01:18:22,531 --> 01:18:25,466
¤ <i>Try to help you</i> ¤

915
01:18:25,500 --> 01:18:28,128
¤ <i>I can't do it</i>
<i>all by myself</i>. ¤

916
01:18:35,177 --> 01:18:38,305
Oh, honey,
you're so funny.

917
01:18:38,346 --> 01:18:40,177
No!

918
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:42,479
- Whoop!
- Oh!

919
01:18:42,517 --> 01:18:44,348
<i>Shh, quiet!</i>

920
01:18:47,689 --> 01:18:50,351
- Mom!
- Hi, honey.

921
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:55,219
Walter, Walter,
this is Stan.

922
01:18:55,263 --> 01:18:57,493
I've heard a lot
about you, Walter.

923
01:18:57,532 --> 01:18:59,591
Your uncles
still sleeping?

924
01:18:59,634 --> 01:19:01,192
Best not
wake 'em up.

925
01:19:01,236 --> 01:19:03,170
Shh, come on.
Wanna go sit down?

926
01:19:04,873 --> 01:19:07,433
You got so big.

927
01:19:11,046 --> 01:19:14,345
So Stan here
is a detective.

928
01:19:14,382 --> 01:19:17,374
A real private eye
just like in the movies.

929
01:19:17,419 --> 01:19:19,512
- Wow, really?
- Sure, sure.

930
01:19:19,554 --> 01:19:21,681
You wanna see my badge?

931
01:19:21,723 --> 01:19:23,850
<i>Stan works in Las Vegas</i>.
<i>How about that?</i>

932
01:19:27,129 --> 01:19:30,223
- What about court reporting school?
- <i>Oh, I had to quit</i>.

933
01:19:30,265 --> 01:19:33,234
Stan wants me to stay home
and be a wife and mother.

934
01:19:33,268 --> 01:19:34,895
<i>Won't that be wonderful?</i>

935
01:19:37,038 --> 01:19:40,997
I bet you found out where
your uncles hid all that money, huh?

936
01:19:44,146 --> 01:19:45,340
Why do you want to know?

937
01:19:46,815 --> 01:19:49,682
Walt, your uncles
match the description

938
01:19:49,718 --> 01:19:52,209
of two bank robbers
from the '20s and '30s.

939
01:19:52,254 --> 01:19:54,779
- No, you're wrong.
- When Mae told me about them,

940
01:19:54,823 --> 01:19:57,018
<i>I got copies of the reports</i>
<i>and showed them to her</i>.

941
01:19:57,058 --> 01:19:58,047
It's them, honey.

942
01:19:59,795 --> 01:20:02,263
They used shotguns.
They wore disguises.

943
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:05,528
<i>They stole all that money</i>.
<i>And they shot people...</i>

944
01:20:05,567 --> 01:20:07,034
innocent people.

945
01:20:07,068 --> 01:20:10,333
No, not them.
It can't be.

946
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:13,034
Stan knows what he's
talking about, honey.

947
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:14,974
What about Jasmine?

948
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:17,069
She and Uncle Hub
were in love. They...

949
01:20:17,112 --> 01:20:19,808
- I have her picture.
- Honey, wasn't Jasmine

950
01:20:19,848 --> 01:20:22,214
<i>the woman who was driving</i>
<i>the getaway car?</i>

951
01:20:22,250 --> 01:20:25,219
- Oh, right.
- <i>Oh, Jasmine</i>...

952
01:20:25,253 --> 01:20:27,721
<i>she was wounded</i>.

953
01:20:27,756 --> 01:20:30,725
<i>And they just</i>
<i>drove off</i>...

954
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:34,055
and left her for dead.

955
01:20:36,531 --> 01:20:38,328
<i>I know this hurts, son</i>.

956
01:20:40,702 --> 01:20:43,762
But they're criminals,
and they lied to you.

957
01:20:43,805 --> 01:20:46,774
My poor baby!

958
01:20:46,808 --> 01:20:49,936
Oh, in the arms
of vicious criminals.

959
01:20:49,978 --> 01:20:52,208
We came just as soon
as we found out.

960
01:20:52,247 --> 01:20:54,272
We've come
to take you away.

961
01:20:54,316 --> 01:20:56,511
Now, I want you to tell Stan
where the money is,

962
01:20:56,551 --> 01:20:58,246
then we'll
go pack your things, okay?

963
01:21:02,390 --> 01:21:04,984
Why do you need to know
where the money is?

964
01:21:05,026 --> 01:21:06,687
Look at me, son.

965
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:09,822
Because it doesn't
belong to them.

966
01:21:09,865 --> 01:21:12,800
It's stolen.

967
01:21:12,834 --> 01:21:16,292
Why, it's probably hidden
right outside here somewhere, right?

968
01:21:16,338 --> 01:21:18,169
Close by?

969
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:24,736
I'll tell you what, why don't we
take a little walk, huh?

970
01:21:24,779 --> 01:21:26,872
Show us around the place.
What do you say?

971
01:21:26,915 --> 01:21:27,904
<i>Let's go</i>.

972
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:36,415
Well, Walt, your mother
and I found a nice house.

973
01:21:36,458 --> 01:21:39,052
Don't have enough money
for the down payment though.

974
01:21:39,094 --> 01:21:42,188
We could always turn your uncles in
for the reward money,

975
01:21:42,230 --> 01:21:43,424
but they'd go to jail.

976
01:21:43,465 --> 01:21:45,126
Since all that money's
stolen, honey,

977
01:21:45,166 --> 01:21:47,532
we got a right to it
just as much as they do.

978
01:21:47,569 --> 01:21:49,935
We'll have a nice family
and nobody gets hurt.

979
01:21:49,971 --> 01:21:53,930
Isn't it wonderful, Walter?
It's what we always wanted.

980
01:21:53,975 --> 01:21:55,602
So where is it?

981
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:57,441
They're old, they're gonna
die soon anyway.

982
01:21:57,479 --> 01:21:59,379
You want Uncle Sam to end up
with all that dough?

983
01:21:59,414 --> 01:22:01,439
Just tell us.

984
01:22:11,026 --> 01:22:14,257
Hub and Garth didn't rob any banks.
They were in Africa.

985
01:22:14,296 --> 01:22:16,764
Africa!
Oh, Walter, be serious.

986
01:22:16,798 --> 01:22:19,358
Really! They were shanghaied
into the Foreign Legion,

987
01:22:19,401 --> 01:22:22,393
and had adventures for 40 years.
They couldn't have robbed any banks!

988
01:22:22,437 --> 01:22:24,405
Come on, pal.
You don't believe all that, do you?

989
01:22:24,439 --> 01:22:27,738
- Sure, I do!
- You?! Mr. Doubting Thomas?

990
01:22:27,776 --> 01:22:31,735
Here Stan's got actual evidence
and you believe that Africa crap?!

991
01:22:34,082 --> 01:22:35,879
Yes. Yes, I do.

992
01:22:37,686 --> 01:22:39,881
Mae, you should go wait
on the porch.

993
01:22:39,921 --> 01:22:42,151
We're gonna have a little chat,
man to man.

994
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:44,658
Why don't we talk in the barn?
What do you say?

995
01:22:56,504 --> 01:22:58,438
Come on!

996
01:22:59,474 --> 01:23:01,601
Getting warmer? Huh?

997
01:23:03,678 --> 01:23:05,441
No, let go!

998
01:23:08,817 --> 01:23:11,047
Let's you and me
get something straight.

999
01:23:11,086 --> 01:23:14,078
We can be friends
or we can be enemies.

1000
01:23:14,122 --> 01:23:16,022
I've had a run
of crummy luck lately.

1001
01:23:16,057 --> 01:23:18,992
I know some bad people who want
to cause a lot of trouble for me.

1002
01:23:19,027 --> 01:23:21,723
I need that money
and I know it's close.

1003
01:23:22,797 --> 01:23:26,324
I'll be damned if some snot-nosed kid
is gonna stand in my way.

1004
01:23:26,368 --> 01:23:28,802
So what's
it gonna be, pal?

1005
01:23:28,837 --> 01:23:32,068
Friends or enemies?

1006
01:23:40,548 --> 01:23:42,982
Defend yourself.

1007
01:23:43,018 --> 01:23:44,451
Huh?

1008
01:23:58,033 --> 01:24:00,501
Where is it?!

1009
01:24:00,535 --> 01:24:02,162
Where's the money?
Where is it?

1010
01:24:04,272 --> 01:24:06,365
<i>Where is it?</i>

1011
01:24:06,408 --> 01:24:08,706
Where is it?

1012
01:24:08,743 --> 01:24:11,007
Tell me where it is!

1013
01:24:12,580 --> 01:24:14,013
Tell me where it is!

1014
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:16,278
Where is it?!

1015
01:24:27,195 --> 01:24:29,663
I heard some noise.

1016
01:24:30,665 --> 01:24:32,360
Oh God!

1017
01:24:34,869 --> 01:24:35,858
Jasmine?

1018
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:45,138
Oh my goodness!
Oh my goodness! Stan!

1019
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:46,647
It's dead.

1020
01:24:46,681 --> 01:24:49,309
Oh my God, he's dead!
Stan's dead!

1021
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:51,181
No, he'll live.
I'm talking about the lion.

1022
01:24:51,219 --> 01:24:52,880
Oh!

1023
01:24:52,921 --> 01:24:56,015
We have to get him to the hospital.
Mae, get your car.

1024
01:24:56,057 --> 01:24:57,991
- I can't, I can't!
- Mae, your car!

1025
01:24:58,026 --> 01:25:00,586
- Get it, get it!
- Okay, okay.

1026
01:25:00,628 --> 01:25:02,994
- Let's get this lion off him.
- Okay.

1027
01:25:06,835 --> 01:25:08,700
This man's
gonna need some stitches.

1028
01:25:08,736 --> 01:25:10,670
A lotta damn stitches.

1029
01:25:10,705 --> 01:25:13,105
What happened to her?

1030
01:25:13,141 --> 01:25:17,100
It looks like her heart gave out
in all the excitement.

1031
01:25:17,145 --> 01:25:19,670
- Yeah.
- She was plenty old, you know?

1032
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:23,583
Look...

1033
01:25:25,019 --> 01:25:26,782
I think she's smiling.

1034
01:25:26,821 --> 01:25:30,757
Yeah.
I guess she died happy.

1035
01:25:32,594 --> 01:25:34,960
She died with her boots on,
that's the main thing.

1036
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:37,521
Protecting her cub.

1037
01:25:43,271 --> 01:25:46,365
She was a real lion,
wasn't she?

1038
01:25:46,407 --> 01:25:48,102
There at the end.

1039
01:25:49,377 --> 01:25:50,867
Sure.

1040
01:25:50,912 --> 01:25:53,244
<i>A real jungle lion</i>.

1041
01:25:55,917 --> 01:25:58,351
A real Africa lion.

1042
01:26:23,178 --> 01:26:25,442
You finished packing?

1043
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:31,480
Your momma's gonna be back
from the hospital soon.

1044
01:26:31,519 --> 01:26:35,080
You can wait for her
on the front porch.

1045
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:56,841
Stay right here.

1046
01:26:56,878 --> 01:26:58,937
Don't you move
a muscle.

1047
01:27:03,218 --> 01:27:06,745
So you all packed?
Where's your suitcase?

1048
01:27:07,889 --> 01:27:09,186
Don't be fresh.

1049
01:27:10,725 --> 01:27:14,024
- Upstairs in my room.
- Well, let's go get it.

1050
01:27:23,538 --> 01:27:26,006
Howdy, Stan.

1051
01:27:29,043 --> 01:27:31,409
You know,
you're lucky, Stan.

1052
01:27:31,446 --> 01:27:33,880
Lucky that lion got to you
before we did.

1053
01:27:36,751 --> 01:27:39,185
I wonder what your uncles
are saying to Stan.

1054
01:27:40,989 --> 01:27:44,516
Probably their "What every boy needs
to know about being a man" speech.

1055
01:27:44,559 --> 01:27:48,495
<i>Well, I'm glad to see</i>
<i>they're making friends</i>.

1056
01:27:48,529 --> 01:27:51,726
<i>So you all set?</i>

1057
01:27:53,468 --> 01:27:55,333
<i>Let's go</i>.

1058
01:27:55,370 --> 01:28:00,034
To make a long story short, Stan,
you and me, we can be friends...

1059
01:28:01,075 --> 01:28:04,203
or we can be enemies.

1060
01:28:06,481 --> 01:28:09,848
Well, boys, I hope Walter
wasn't too much trouble.

1061
01:28:09,884 --> 01:28:12,785
- We managed.
- What's gonna happen to him?

1062
01:28:12,820 --> 01:28:15,653
A man like that's got
no business being around your boy.

1063
01:28:15,690 --> 01:28:19,387
Well, of course not.
What kind of a mother would I be?

1064
01:28:19,427 --> 01:28:21,361
I'm gonna drop him off
in Las Vegas.

1065
01:28:34,042 --> 01:28:37,341
L... I'll be back
for the...

1066
01:28:37,378 --> 01:28:40,040
rest of that speech if...

1067
01:28:41,516 --> 01:28:43,780
I'll be here.

1068
01:28:51,492 --> 01:28:53,323
Good boy.

1069
01:28:59,901 --> 01:29:02,096
Thanks for the s-stories

1070
01:29:02,136 --> 01:29:05,162
and everything.
It... it...

1071
01:29:05,206 --> 01:29:07,697
it meant an...

1072
01:29:07,742 --> 01:29:10,677
an awful, awful lot.

1073
01:29:12,747 --> 01:29:14,612
I'm glad.

1074
01:29:29,931 --> 01:29:33,025
<i>Well, come on, honey</i>.
<i>We're burning daylight</i>.

1075
01:30:08,636 --> 01:30:10,604
<i>Damn</i>.

1076
01:30:10,638 --> 01:30:13,630
She doesn't deserve
that kid.

1077
01:30:13,674 --> 01:30:15,904
Maybe we should
get a lawyer.

1078
01:30:15,943 --> 01:30:18,275
No judge is gonna take a child
away from its mother

1079
01:30:18,312 --> 01:30:21,179
and give it to two old
bachelor uncles.

1080
01:30:21,215 --> 01:30:24,343
Maybe she'll sell him to us.
How much money we got?

1081
01:30:24,385 --> 01:30:26,182
Hub...

1082
01:30:26,220 --> 01:30:29,883
there's nothing we can do.
He's gone.

1083
01:31:05,326 --> 01:31:07,317
So where are we going?

1084
01:31:07,361 --> 01:31:10,660
I told you, Las Vegas.

1085
01:31:10,698 --> 01:31:14,259
I mean after.
After we drop Stan off.

1086
01:31:14,302 --> 01:31:18,295
Well, honey, Stan's gonna need
a lot of looking after.

1087
01:31:32,520 --> 01:31:34,249
Walter!

1088
01:31:35,823 --> 01:31:37,120
<i>What are you doing?!</i>

1089
01:31:39,660 --> 01:31:41,423
Oh my God!

1090
01:31:47,468 --> 01:31:50,733
Walter! Walter!

1091
01:31:51,839 --> 01:31:54,672
Walter, stop!

1092
01:31:54,709 --> 01:31:56,734
<i>Stop right there!</i>

1093
01:31:57,778 --> 01:31:59,609
What's gotten into you?

1094
01:32:01,115 --> 01:32:05,916
Oh, honey, are you all right?
You gave me a heart attack.

1095
01:32:05,953 --> 01:32:08,945
You're still marrying him
after everything.

1096
01:32:08,990 --> 01:32:10,617
Oh, he's not so bad.

1097
01:32:10,658 --> 01:32:13,218
A little rough around the edges,
but he can change.

1098
01:32:13,261 --> 01:32:14,888
Mom!

1099
01:32:16,464 --> 01:32:18,432
He says he loves me.

1100
01:32:18,466 --> 01:32:22,061
- Has he hit you yet?
- Mind your own business!

1101
01:32:24,705 --> 01:32:28,004
You always think a new boyfriend
solves everything,

1102
01:32:28,042 --> 01:32:31,102
but you always pick losers,
and he's the worst of them all.

1103
01:32:33,047 --> 01:32:37,279
Walter, I had no choice.

1104
01:32:39,987 --> 01:32:41,852
Maybe you don't.

1105
01:32:43,991 --> 01:32:45,720
What?

1106
01:32:49,964 --> 01:32:52,990
- Mom?
- What?

1107
01:32:58,105 --> 01:33:00,869
Do something for me.

1108
01:33:00,908 --> 01:33:03,399
For once.

1109
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:08,849
Do something
that's best for me.

1110
01:33:08,883 --> 01:33:10,908
Okay?

1111
01:33:52,960 --> 01:33:56,919
Salesmen ought to be here
in two, three hours.

1112
01:33:56,964 --> 01:33:59,762
- Whoop-de-doo.
- Uh-huh.

1113
01:34:08,442 --> 01:34:09,875
Lookie yonder.

1114
01:34:48,015 --> 01:34:50,176
Okay,
if I'm gonna live here,

1115
01:34:50,217 --> 01:34:52,208
there's gonna be
some conditions.

1116
01:34:52,253 --> 01:34:55,051
Conditions?

1117
01:34:55,089 --> 01:34:57,148
One, you two
gotta stick around

1118
01:34:57,191 --> 01:34:59,318
until I'm through
with high school at least,

1119
01:34:59,360 --> 01:35:00,884
preferably college.

1120
01:35:00,928 --> 01:35:02,987
<i>You both</i>
<i>got responsibilities now...</i>

1121
01:35:03,030 --> 01:35:05,794
PTA, Boy Scouts,
Little League,

1122
01:35:05,833 --> 01:35:07,698
the works.

1123
01:35:07,735 --> 01:35:09,760
Sounds like we don't have
much choice.

1124
01:35:11,072 --> 01:35:15,031
Two, you both gotta take
better care of yourselves.

1125
01:35:15,076 --> 01:35:18,239
More vegetables, less meat.

1126
01:35:18,279 --> 01:35:21,874
I wonder if traveling salesmen
sell school supplies?

1127
01:35:21,916 --> 01:35:23,713
And three,

1128
01:35:23,751 --> 01:35:26,151
no more
dangerous stuff.

1129
01:35:26,187 --> 01:35:28,587
No fighting teenagers,
no airplanes...

1130
01:35:28,622 --> 01:35:30,214
Now wait one minute...

1131
01:35:30,257 --> 01:35:31,952
At least till I'm through
with college.

1132
01:35:31,992 --> 01:35:34,256
- <i>Maybe longer</i>.
- What do you expect us to die of?

1133
01:35:34,295 --> 01:35:36,024
Old age?

1134
01:35:43,771 --> 01:35:45,830
Well...

1135
01:35:49,110 --> 01:35:51,340
welcome home.

1136
01:36:35,256 --> 01:36:37,349
- <i>Hello?</i>
<i>- Walter?</i>

1137
01:36:37,391 --> 01:36:40,326
- <i>Yes?</i>
<i>- This is Sheriff Grady</i>.

1138
01:36:40,361 --> 01:36:42,693
<i>I'm afraid I have</i>
<i>some bad news for you</i>.

1139
01:36:42,730 --> 01:36:45,255
<i>It's about</i>
<i>your two uncles</i>.

1140
01:36:45,299 --> 01:36:48,063
<i>I'm sorry,</i>
<i>they passed away</i>.

1141
01:36:48,102 --> 01:36:51,037
<i>There was an accident</i>...

1142
01:36:51,071 --> 01:36:53,665
<i>and it's a blessing</i>
<i>that they didn't suffer</i>.

1143
01:36:53,707 --> 01:36:57,666
<i>It's a blessing too,</i>
<i>in a way, that they went together</i>.

1144
01:36:57,711 --> 01:36:59,576
<i>You understand</i>.

1145
01:36:59,613 --> 01:37:02,514
<i>I'm over here</i>
<i>at your uncles' place now</i>.

1146
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:04,916
<i>You need to come on</i>
<i>over here</i>.

1147
01:37:04,952 --> 01:37:06,817
<i>You need to see this</i>
<i>for yourself</i>.

1148
01:38:13,087 --> 01:38:15,885
- Walter?
- How you doing?

1149
01:38:15,923 --> 01:38:17,754
All right.

1150
01:38:24,231 --> 01:38:26,222
Best I can figure,
they were trying to fly

1151
01:38:26,267 --> 01:38:28,462
through that barn
upside down.

1152
01:38:32,306 --> 01:38:35,867
Had a bunch of reporters
out here earlier, even CNN.

1153
01:38:35,910 --> 01:38:38,811
I guess any time a biplane...

1154
01:38:38,846 --> 01:38:41,781
from the First World War
crashes doing acrobatics,

1155
01:38:41,815 --> 01:38:44,113
being flown by two
90-year-old men...

1156
01:38:44,151 --> 01:38:46,711
neither one of them
with pilot's licenses...

1157
01:38:46,754 --> 01:38:49,154
well...

1158
01:38:50,324 --> 01:38:53,259
well, they had a good long run,
both of them.

1159
01:38:53,294 --> 01:38:56,559
They went out
with their boots on.

1160
01:39:00,234 --> 01:39:03,601
Here.
I found their will.

1161
01:39:12,179 --> 01:39:14,010
"The kid gets it all.

1162
01:39:15,549 --> 01:39:18,541
Just plant us
in the damn garden...

1163
01:39:19,753 --> 01:39:21,983
with the stupid lion."

1164
01:39:40,007 --> 01:39:42,100
<i>Hey!</i>

1165
01:39:42,142 --> 01:39:44,633
We've got some company.

1166
01:40:07,634 --> 01:40:09,864
This is it.

1167
01:40:09,903 --> 01:40:11,165
<i>This is where</i>
<i>they lived</i>.

1168
01:40:13,407 --> 01:40:15,170
It's okay.
Come here, buddy.

1169
01:40:15,209 --> 01:40:18,440
Come here.
Look at this.

1170
01:40:18,479 --> 01:40:20,606
Look at this.

1171
01:40:22,349 --> 01:40:24,374
Forgive me.

1172
01:40:24,418 --> 01:40:27,216
We were in Houston when we heard
their names on the news,

1173
01:40:27,254 --> 01:40:30,621
and, well,
we just had to come.

1174
01:40:30,657 --> 01:40:33,626
When I was a boy,
my grandfather told me such stories.

1175
01:40:33,660 --> 01:40:37,152
- Your grandfather?
- A very wealthy sheik.

1176
01:40:37,197 --> 01:40:40,997
He used to love to tell me
stories about his wild youth.

1177
01:40:41,035 --> 01:40:44,835
Amazing, unbelievable stories
all about two brothers,

1178
01:40:44,872 --> 01:40:46,669
Hub and Garth McCann,

1179
01:40:46,707 --> 01:40:50,302
the most valiant
and brave men, huh?

1180
01:40:50,344 --> 01:40:53,541
He called them his
"most honored adversaries."

1181
01:40:53,580 --> 01:40:55,844
"The only men who ever
outsmarted me."

1182
01:40:57,284 --> 01:40:58,774
Wait, so you...

1183
01:41:00,187 --> 01:41:02,052
you knew these two men?

1184
01:41:03,257 --> 01:41:05,521
They... they raised me.

1185
01:41:05,559 --> 01:41:07,493
It's an honor.

1186
01:41:08,829 --> 01:41:11,627
- Nice to meet you.
- It's nice to meet you.

1187
01:41:11,665 --> 01:41:13,565
Wow.

1188
01:41:15,936 --> 01:41:17,927
Aha.

1189
01:41:17,971 --> 01:41:20,371
I see they spent
my grandfather's gold wisely.

1190
01:41:20,407 --> 01:41:21,704
Yeah.

1191
01:41:24,545 --> 01:41:27,844
Well, there was this one
traveling salesman.

1192
01:41:30,050 --> 01:41:31,415
<i>So</i>...

1193
01:41:31,452 --> 01:41:34,421
the two men from great
grandfather's stories,

1194
01:41:34,455 --> 01:41:35,581
they really lived?

1195
01:41:38,692 --> 01:41:40,785
Yeah...

1196
01:41:42,429 --> 01:41:44,920
they really <i>lived</i>.
