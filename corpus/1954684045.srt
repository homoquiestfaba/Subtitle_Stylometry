00:45:27,842 --> 00:45:29,511
- I haven't seen them.
- Really?

349
00:45:29,711 --> 00:45:31,377
They're not in your jeans or something?

350
00:45:33,114 --> 00:45:35,183
Hold on a second. I'll be right there.

351
00:45:35,847 --> 00:45:37,914
All right.

352
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:53,835
Oh, listen, would you mind
hurrying up a little bit?

353
00:45:53,935 --> 00:45:56,237
I don't wanna get snagged up
in rush hour traffic.

354
00:45:56,337 --> 00:45:58,370
Actually...

355
00:45:59,340 --> 00:46:02,341
- Ah, here they are.
- Why don't we stay?

360
00:48:13,841 --> 00:48:16,909
Oh, hey. Morning.

361
00:48:18,212 --> 00:48:20,581
So why did you sleep
on the couch last night?

362
00:48:20,681 --> 00:48:22,584
Was I that bad in bed?

363
00:48:22,684 --> 00:48:25,420
No, I, uh... I just couldn't sleep.

364
00:48:25,520 --> 00:48:29,722
- Nightmares again?
- No, thank God.

365
00:49:16,838 --> 00:49:19,512
- All right, I won't be long.
- Okay, I'm gonna go and get gas.

366
00:49:19,612 --> 00:49:21,306
Okay.

00:49:56,877 --> 00:49:57,943
Excuse me.

369
00:50:00,548 --> 00:50:02,483
- More coffee?
- Uh, no, thanks.

370
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:06,654
I'm sorry, this might seem a bit random,
but do you know this woman?

371
00:50:06,954 --> 00:50:09,491
She built a modern style glass
house out here,

372
00:50:09,591 --> 00:50:12,108
about 10 miles north
of the old Gamma Ranch.

373
00:50:14,762 --> 00:50:18,797
You may want to talk to Joe over there.
He knows everyone in town.

374
00:50:20,001 --> 00:50:21,767
Thanks.

I'm sorry to bother you, but, um...

378
00:50:32,213 --> 00:50:35,617
my name's Anna and I'm looking
for someone from around here.

379
00:50:35,717 --> 00:50:38,551
The bartender said
that you might be able to help.

380
00:50:43,524 --> 00:50:47,942
I'm staying at the glass house.
It's 10 miles north. You know it?

381
00:50:48,629 --> 00:50:51,499
Yeah, I know that house. What about it?

382
00:50:52,199 --> 00:50:55,269
I'm looking for the architect,
Vera Palm.

383
00:50:55,369 --> 00:50:56,969
Does that ring any bells?

384
00:51:05,846 --> 00:51:07,132
Let's talk outside.

385
00:51:18,926 --> 00:51:20,995
I know her housekeeper.

386

- Jeremy?
- Yes. He...

387
00:51:23,564 --> 00:51:27,168
- comes in for guidance now and then.
- What sort of guidance?

388
00:51:27,268 --> 00:51:31,172
For $39 a session, you can find out.

389
00:51:31,272 --> 00:51:36,110
I also offer a lot of original
healing stones and native artwork.

390
00:51:36,210 --> 00:51:38,577
My shop is right over there.

391
00:51:41,749 --> 00:51:43,718
I think this has been
a misunderstanding.

392
00:51:44,318 --> 00:51:45,551
Are you sure?

393
00:51:48,156 --> 00:51:50,224
Hey, Anna, you ready?

394
00:51:50,624 --> 00:51:52,527
Look, I'm just trying to find
this woman.

395
00:51:52,827 --> 00:51:55,094
Well, you can't. She's missing.

396
00:51:56,030 --> 00:51:57,196
Since when?

397
00:51:59,867 --> 00:52:02,870
- Last March.
- Wait, what happened?

398
00:52:03,270 --> 00:52:05,804
JOE: Number's on the card.

399
00:52:27,862 --> 00:52:30,328
Oh, it's freezing in here.

400
00:52:32,366 --> 00:52:34,635
Why don't you take a little nap?

401
00:52:34,735 --> 00:52:38,873
Then when you wake up,
I can grill up some of these, uh...

402
00:52:39,173 --> 00:52:42,040
juicy local steaks I keep hearing about.

403
00:52:42,743 --> 00:52:45,940

we decided to stay in the end.

What?

00:52:54,922 --> 00:52:58,224

have a nice, quiet evening together.

00:53:04,382 --> 00:53:08,906
- You know what happened on March 2nd.
- Who have you been talking to now?

411
00:53:09,006 --> 00:53:13,605
Doesn't matter. What matters is you didn't
tell me the truth and I wanna know why.

00:53:14,441 --> 00:53:15,636
(SCOFFS)

413
00:53:15,736 --> 00:53:19,610
Okay, uh... the truth is
I didn't want to scare you.

414
00:53:20,181 --> 00:53:22,583
It can be pretty intimidating out here
when you're by yourself.

415
00:53:23,171 --> 00:53:26,120
I just didn't wanna fuel
your vivid imagination

416
00:53:26,220 --> 00:53:29,757
with legends about
disappearing people in the desert.

417
00:53:30,057 --> 00:53:32,527
Well, if it's just an urban legend,
then why not tell me?

418
00:53:32,627 --> 00:53:34,360
Because that's what they are.

The designer of this house,
the architect of this house...

422
00:53:48,709 --> 00:53:51,045
got lost in the desert.

423
00:53:51,245 --> 00:53:54,315
She went for a hike and never came back.

424
00:53:54,415 --> 00:53:59,616
Apparently it happens all the time.
People get lost, but she didn't come back.

425
00:54:00,521 --> 00:54:04,125
- And you're saying you didn't know her.
- Well, how would I?

426
00:54:04,305 --> 00:54:07,328
(SCOFFS) I don't believe you.

00:54:14,068 --> 00:54:16,771
I'm getting worried about you now, Anna.

429
00:54:16,871 --> 00:54:18,928
It's... it's somewhere down here.

430
00:54:23,978 --> 00:54:27,014
- Well, I guess you cleaned it out.
- The photograph? Yes, I did.

431
00:54:27,214 --> 00:54:28,549
Because you didn't want me
to see her with you.

432
00:54:28,649 --> 00:54:31,219
Of course I didn't want you
to see me with my ex.

433
00:54:31,952 --> 00:54:34,789
I wouldn't want to see photographs of you
lying around with your ex either.

434
00:54:35,189 --> 00:54:38,891
You're hiding something from me. And don't
just keep blaming it on my vivid imagination.

435
00:54:40,161 --> 00:54:43,264
Oh, really, Anna? Because considering
your history of mental illness...

436
00:54:43,364 --> 00:54:46,417
Nightmares are not
a mental illness, Paul!

437
00:54:46,517 --> 00:54:48,002
Well...

438
00:54:48,102 --> 00:54:51,069
judging by the amount
of medication you're tak...

439
00:54:55,609 --> 00:54:57,376
I know what I've seen.

440
00:55:06,287 --> 00:55:08,854
I made a terrible mistake.

441
00:55:12,460 --> 00:55:13,492

00:55:19,466 --> 00:55:21,833
You're right about one thing.

443
00:55:24,305 --> 00:55:26,344
I've been hiding something from you.

444
00:55:30,344 --> 00:55:35,114
I couldn't just watch you pounding
these things down day after day.

445
00:55:36,517 --> 00:55:38,759
They're placebos.

446
00:55:40,788 --> 00:55:43,457
At least you've been having plenty
of vitamin C the last few days.

447

Yeah.

449
00:55:49,196 --> 00:55:51,864
That's why you've been having
such extreme reactions.

450
00:55:54,769 --> 00:55:57,004
I'm sorry. I thought you could...

451
00:55:57,104 --> 00:55:59,340
do without them.

00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:01,407

Don't touch me!

You know, maybe this writing gig's
just a bit too much pressure for you.

- I can't stay here tonight.
- Oh, God.

- I'm gonna stay in town.
- You serious?

- We'll talk tomorrow.
- Okay, well, listen.

It's Anna. We met this afternoon.
I need to talk to you.

Let me know if you're interested
in anything

474
00:58:25,252 --> 00:58:27,454
and I'm sure we could work out
some kind of a discount.

pick one of these stones.

- This one?
- Sure.

Do you ever, uh...

501
01:00:52,099 --> 01:00:55,664
feel a growing pressure in your chest
when you... when you dream?

How did you know that?

In the native culture, it's known that
spirits can possess the body when you sleep.

505

They can capture the soul
and take control of the flesh.

To do what?

507
01:01:18,024 --> 01:01:20,528

to me, all right? You have to help me.

Please.

511
01:01:40,180 --> 01:01:42,755
The only... only way
to fight off this spirit

512
01:01:42,855 --> 01:01:46,186
is to control your dream
and command it to leave.

513
01:01:46,586 --> 01:01:51,490
We'll, uh... induce a wake-initiated
lucid dream and you'll become conscious.

514
01:01:53,927 --> 01:01:57,509
When you reach that state, I need you
to perform some sort of physical activity

515
01:01:57,609 --> 01:02:01,768
so that your muscles will echo
that movement in this realm.

they said, um...

615

stopped her from going over the cliff.

01:14:00,920 --> 01:14:04,454

but I just couldn't imagine...

624
01:14:06,259 --> 01:14:09,493
being her caretaker
for the rest of my life.

625
01:14:14,901 --> 01:14:18,171
So when she started to get better,

626
01:14:18,938 --> 01:14:21,405
I got her the dog.

627
01:14:22,875 --> 01:14:26,276
And she came to live out here
by herself.

628
01:14:28,748 --> 01:14:31,982

632
01:14:53,906 --> 01:14:57,674
Then Vera called me
one day and said, uh...

633
01:14:58,177 --> 01:15:00,813
said she wanted me to come out here

634
01:15:00,913 --> 01:15:02,813

we got to the salt lake,

637
01:15:12,825 --> 01:15:15,513
I realized what it was all about.

638
01:15:17,597 --> 01:15:21,334

to move back to Los Angeles,

639
01:15:22,034 --> 01:15:25,104

640
01:15:25,204 --> 01:15:27,941
It was the last thing I wanted to hear.

641
01:15:28,458 --> 01:15:31,008
So I told her about us.

642
01:15:31,944 --> 01:15:34,614
She was furious.

643
01:15:34,714 --> 01:15:37,417
She said she would divorce me.

644
01:15:37,517 --> 01:15:41,421
I would lose everything.
All my savings, the house.

645
01:15:41,521 --> 01:15:44,424
She said she would ruin me
if I didn't stay with her.

into the salt lake.

652
01:16:21,594 --> 01:16:24,228
took the dog and kept on walking.
