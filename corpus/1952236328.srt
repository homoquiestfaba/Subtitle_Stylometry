00:00:00,003 --> 00:00:01,975
PRIME SUSPECT
Episode 2
Operaton Nadine

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:04,813
<i>I´m Detective Chief Inspector
Jane Tenison</i>

3
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:07,778
<i>attached to Southampton Row
Police Station</i>

4
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:12,139
<i>We are in the interview room
at Southampton Row</i>

5
00:00:12,221 --> 00:00:15,452
<i>Would you please state
your full name and date of birth</i>

6
00:00:22,781 --> 00:00:25,534
Would you please state
your full name and date of birth.

7
00:00:29,981 --> 00:00:31,700
Robert Oswalde.

8
00:00:31,782 --> 00:00:33,500
13th of August...

9
00:00:33,582 --> 00:00:35,538
1961.

10
00:00:50,623 --> 00:00:52,579
It´s the police!

11
00:00:54,023 --> 00:00:55,979
Excuse me, please!

12
00:00:58,103 --> 00:01:01,937
We´re laying new drains.
I think it´s covered in polythene.

13
00:01:03,943 --> 00:01:07,219
So, she consented to sex with you?

14
00:01:07,303 --> 00:01:09,864
She was begging for it, man!

15
00:01:09,944 --> 00:01:13,732
If she was willing,
why did you use violence?

16
00:01:13,824 --> 00:01:15,894
You know how these things happen.

17
00:01:15,984 --> 00:01:18,054
No, I don´t know.

18
00:01:18,144 --> 00:01:21,773
Some of them white thing,
them like it rough, you know!

19
00:01:28,504 --> 00:01:32,817
Jesus, Frank, what is it with you
and red lights?

20
00:01:36,025 --> 00:01:37,902
Have the Pakis murdered someone?

21
00:01:37,985 --> 00:01:40,055
Shut your mouth and move that bike.

22
00:01:40,145 --> 00:01:44,423
Nobody talk to him like that!
We live here, not you!

23
00:01:44,505 --> 00:01:47,383
- Are you in charge?
- Yes, sir, for the time being.

24
00:01:47,465 --> 00:01:48,865
Then, please, take it away.

25
00:01:48,946 --> 00:01:50,937
We will, sir, as soon as possible.

26
00:01:51,026 --> 00:01:54,063
Not "as soon as possible" - now!
I pay my poll tax.

27
00:01:54,146 --> 00:01:57,616
It´s a suspicious death, sir.
All this has to be done properly.

28
00:01:57,706 --> 00:01:59,742
Can you go with this officer, please?

29
00:01:59,826 --> 00:02:01,782
I´ve just got to ask a few questions.

30
00:02:08,427 --> 00:02:12,625
How did you know
that this girl wanted it "rough"?

31
00:02:12,707 --> 00:02:15,141
I knew. The way she look.

32
00:02:15,227 --> 00:02:17,343
Well, how did she look?

33
00:02:22,827 --> 00:02:24,943
She had blonde hair...

34
00:02:26,548 --> 00:02:29,665
...and she was wearing a red blouse.

35
00:02:33,268 --> 00:02:36,738
And a tight, tight, black skirt,
like for you.

36
00:02:37,788 --> 00:02:42,100
So she didn´t actually
say anything to encourage you?

37
00:02:42,188 --> 00:02:45,898
But then, you did ram
her tights down her throat.

38
00:02:45,989 --> 00:02:47,980
It´s just her word against mine.

39
00:02:48,069 --> 00:02:52,028
It´s the doctor´s reports and
forensic evidence and her word!

40
00:02:52,109 --> 00:02:55,988
How many other women have you attacked?
How long before you kill someone?

41
00:02:56,069 --> 00:03:00,221
Kernan! If that is my Simone
that´s in there...

42
00:03:00,309 --> 00:03:03,824
Nola, I´ve just arrived. Give me a chance
to find out what´s happening.

43
00:03:03,909 --> 00:03:07,425
We won´t be issuing any statements tonight.
Now, go home.

44
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,705
You should all just go home!

45
00:03:09,790 --> 00:03:12,065
You never did try to find my daughter!

46
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:16,620
You people should go home!

47
00:03:16,710 --> 00:03:20,828
If it´s my Simone,
you can´t stop us from going into her.

48
00:03:21,790 --> 00:03:26,740
Cordon it off properly. If it is Simone Cameron,
we´ve got a real problem.

49
00:03:26,831 --> 00:03:28,025
Are Forensics here yet?

50
00:03:28,111 --> 00:03:30,067
Yeah, they´re waiting for you, guv.

51
00:03:33,791 --> 00:03:37,750
Were these slabs in place
when you bought the house?

52
00:03:37,831 --> 00:03:40,709
- Of course, yes.
- You haven´t done any work yourself?

53
00:03:40,791 --> 00:03:42,019
I´m telling you, no.

54
00:03:45,672 --> 00:03:47,583
- Thank you.
- Down here, sir!

55
00:03:47,672 --> 00:03:50,664
Right. Let´s take a dekko.

56
00:04:22,634 --> 00:04:25,751
- Look ´pon her now.
- Sit down please, Robert.

57
00:04:25,834 --> 00:04:28,712
She love it. Cock teaser, innit?

58
00:04:29,434 --> 00:04:32,585
What she say I did to that bitch
is just turning her on.

59
00:04:32,674 --> 00:04:34,904
Sit down, please, Robert.

60
00:04:40,314 --> 00:04:44,228
The thought of a woman being humiliated
doesn´t turn me on.

61
00:04:45,435 --> 00:04:47,665
Someone being frightened half to death.

62
00:04:49,555 --> 00:04:52,308
But that turns you on, doesn´t it?

63
00:04:52,395 --> 00:04:56,308
It must do.
Why else force yourself on someone?

64
00:04:56,395 --> 00:04:59,114
You´re a very attractive man.

65
00:05:00,756 --> 00:05:02,109
How tall are you?

66
00:05:02,196 --> 00:05:05,313
- 6´4".
- Oh, really?

67
00:05:05,396 --> 00:05:09,867
Well, I´m sure a lot of women do fall for you.
But not this one.

68
00:05:09,956 --> 00:05:12,789
- Some women say no when they mean yes.
- Ah! So she said no to you?

69
00:05:12,876 --> 00:05:14,594
- I said "some women".
- She said no?

70
00:05:14,676 --> 00:05:17,395
- I´ve nothing to say.
- That´s not begging for it.

71
00:05:17,476 --> 00:05:21,356
- Bullshit! She put words in my mouth.
- Now let me ask you this.

72
00:05:21,437 --> 00:05:23,997
- That´s a good place to stop.
- I haven´t finished yet.

73
00:05:24,077 --> 00:05:26,875
Unfortunately, we´ll have to,
since it´s well after six.

74
00:05:27,637 --> 00:05:29,593
Unbelievable!

75
00:05:32,517 --> 00:05:35,907
Excellent, though I would just add
one word of warning.

76
00:05:35,997 --> 00:05:40,514
Some of DCI Tennison´s
more unconventional questions

77
00:05:40,598 --> 00:05:43,749
might get a less-experienced officer
into difficulties.

78
00:05:43,838 --> 00:05:50,391
Remember, under PACE, no attempt
may be made to bully or threaten a suspect.

79
00:05:50,478 --> 00:05:54,710
Finally, well done DS Oswalde,
for playing his part so convincingly.

80
00:05:56,598 --> 00:06:01,878
And finally, tomorrow´s first sessión
will be on interviewing the victims of rape.

81
00:06:01,959 --> 00:06:03,870
See you all at ten o´clock.

82
00:06:05,879 --> 00:06:10,509
- You´re too good at that, Detective Sergeant.
- T´ank you, ma´am.

83
00:06:16,519 --> 00:06:20,035
- Are you having a drink later on?
- Maybe. Or I might have an early night.

84
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:21,712
Might see you, then.

85
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:29,630
Looks like it´s a female, Oscar.

86
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:32,280
Oh, yes? What makes you say that, Mr Gold?

87
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:34,633
It´s wearing a bra.

88
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,236
Oh, God. That´s all we need.

89
00:06:38,321 --> 00:06:40,277
Tony, take over till Tennison gets here.

90
00:06:43,641 --> 00:06:47,395
- But she´s still on that course, guv.
- Not any more, she´s not.

91
00:06:47,481 --> 00:06:49,278
Oh, great.

92
00:06:53,321 --> 00:06:56,234
Already?

93
00:06:59,842 --> 00:07:05,394
Yeah. Now what was it you were saying
about white women liking it rough?

94
00:07:05,482 --> 00:07:08,042
Hey, that wasn´t me. I don´t think like that!

95
00:07:12,162 --> 00:07:13,720
Oh, I know, I´m sorry.

96
00:07:14,562 --> 00:07:16,519
Hey...

97
00:07:18,323 --> 00:07:20,473
Know what I´d like to do now?

98
00:07:20,563 --> 00:07:21,518
What?

99
00:07:21,603 --> 00:07:23,958
Drink the entire contents of the minibar.

100
00:07:24,043 --> 00:07:25,158
Why?

101
00:07:25,243 --> 00:07:26,915
Dunno, I just feel like it.

102
00:07:27,003 --> 00:07:29,881
OK. What would you like first?

103
00:07:30,603 --> 00:07:32,514
Champagne.

104
00:07:32,603 --> 00:07:34,560
Right.

105
00:07:41,204 --> 00:07:45,356
Oh, God... That´s Dame Sybil.

106
00:07:45,444 --> 00:07:47,116
Don´t make a sound.

107
00:07:48,364 --> 00:07:50,320
Hello?

108
00:07:51,244 --> 00:07:53,200
Hello, guv.

109
00:07:54,485 --> 00:07:56,441
About two hours. Why?

110
00:07:58,325 --> 00:08:00,077
Right.

111
00:08:02,245 --> 00:08:03,473
OK.

112
00:08:04,325 --> 00:08:06,281
OK. See you. Bye.

113
00:08:07,445 --> 00:08:11,279
- What´s wrong?
- That was my guv. He wants me back.

114
00:08:12,325 --> 00:08:13,600
- Now.
- What?

115
00:08:13,686 --> 00:08:16,280
Yeah, he wants me to head a murder inquiry.

116
00:08:16,366 --> 00:08:20,917
I´ll have to tell Thorndike.
Damn, it´s my lecture tomorrow!

117
00:08:21,006 --> 00:08:25,204
- Look, sod Thorndike.
- Sorry, but there´s nothing I can do about it.

118
00:08:25,286 --> 00:08:26,844
I know that.

119
00:08:26,926 --> 00:08:28,917
What´s your problem, then?

120
00:08:29,006 --> 00:08:32,044
- What about us?
- What about us?

121
00:08:32,807 --> 00:08:34,240
I see.

122
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:39,402
Bob, I´m not saying
I don´t want to see you again.

123
00:08:39,487 --> 00:08:41,205
Aren´t you?

124
00:08:41,287 --> 00:08:44,165
Come on, this is hard enough as it is.

125
00:08:44,247 --> 00:08:47,876
I hear you. OK? The Detective Chief Inspector
has given her orders.

126
00:08:47,967 --> 00:08:49,639
What did you expect?

127
00:08:49,727 --> 00:08:53,357
That´s unfair.
It´s not as if the love of your life is walking out.

128
00:08:53,448 --> 00:08:55,757
I don´t like being treated like some black stud.

129
00:09:00,168 --> 00:09:04,002
- Is that what you think´s been going on?
- Yes, I do.

130
00:09:04,088 --> 00:09:05,601
Well, that´s in your head.

131
00:09:05,688 --> 00:09:07,246
Is it?

132
00:09:10,489 --> 00:09:12,161
I think you´d better go.

133
00:09:12,249 --> 00:09:14,365
Don´t worry. I´m going.

134
00:09:17,969 --> 00:09:21,279
I hope I can rely on you to be discreet.

135
00:09:22,089 --> 00:09:24,967
You really are something else, aren´t you?

136
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:48,399
Bitch.

137
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:50,846
I don´t know anything about rape victims.

138
00:09:50,931 --> 00:09:52,364
Then it´s time you did.

139
00:09:52,451 --> 00:09:56,683
Attitudes like that mean only 8% of rapes are
ever reported. There are my notes.

140
00:09:56,771 --> 00:09:59,649
It´ll be a help but it´s bloody annoying.

141
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:02,689
- What can I do, David?
- Isn´t another DCI available?

142
00:10:02,771 --> 00:10:04,443
Yes, but Kernan wants me.

143
00:10:04,531 --> 00:10:05,441
Why?

144
00:10:05,531 --> 00:10:07,442
Maybe he thinks I´m a good detective.

145
00:10:07,531 --> 00:10:09,966
But why this specific investigation?

146
00:10:10,052 --> 00:10:15,490
The body was found in Honeyford Road
where the Cameron family still live.

147
00:10:15,572 --> 00:10:18,450
It could be Simone Cameron.

148
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:21,881
Politically sensitive, certainly.

149
00:10:22,932 --> 00:10:24,650
A word of advice.

150
00:10:24,732 --> 00:10:30,842
Charges may be brought against the officers
in the Derrick Cameron case,

151
00:10:30,933 --> 00:10:32,730
if it goes to the Court of Appeal.

152
00:10:34,573 --> 00:10:38,202
Quite right too, if that boy was fitted up.

153
00:10:38,293 --> 00:10:40,090
What are you getting at?

154
00:10:40,173 --> 00:10:42,243
I´d be careful, if I were you.

155
00:10:42,333 --> 00:10:45,370
This may not turn out to be such a prize for you.

156
00:10:45,453 --> 00:10:50,209
- Obviously, you´re a liberated woman.
- Oh, thank you, David!

157
00:10:50,294 --> 00:10:54,207
But don´t be too trusting
of our Afro-Caribbean friend.

158
00:10:55,854 --> 00:10:58,209
That´s your advice, is it?

159
00:10:59,214 --> 00:11:01,170
Good luck tomorrow.

160
00:11:06,055 --> 00:11:08,728
Oh, and drive carefully if you´ve been drinking.

161
00:11:22,695 --> 00:11:24,651
OK, ma´am.

162
00:11:30,656 --> 00:11:32,612
Nola!

163
00:11:32,696 --> 00:11:34,607
Go on home!

164
00:11:34,696 --> 00:11:38,814
Not if it´s my Simone.
I don´t want to lose her a second time.

165
00:11:48,977 --> 00:11:51,491
Natural plant fibre such as cotton

166
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:55,855
disintegrates and forms part of the diet
of the early inhabitants of the corpse.

167
00:11:55,937 --> 00:12:00,055
But wool, like hair - they may be the same -
can be remarkably resilient.

168
00:12:00,137 --> 00:12:02,093
How old do you think she is, Oscar?

169
00:12:02,177 --> 00:12:05,887
She was still growing.
Still in her teens, I´d say.

170
00:12:05,978 --> 00:12:08,492
How long before a corpse gets like this?

171
00:12:08,578 --> 00:12:12,366
- That I can´t tell yet.
- Oh, come on, Oscar! Minimum time?

172
00:12:12,458 --> 00:12:15,177
Two years? Don´t quote me on that.

173
00:12:15,258 --> 00:12:16,976
So it could be Simone.

174
00:12:17,058 --> 00:12:20,175
You see, you´re doing it already.

175
00:12:21,738 --> 00:12:24,173
When were these garden slabs laid?

176
00:12:24,259 --> 00:12:27,934
Before the Viswandhas came here.
About 18 months ago.

177
00:12:28,019 --> 00:12:29,930
Who did they buy the house from?

178
00:12:30,019 --> 00:12:33,136
He named some property developer.

179
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:36,177
Have these slabs been disturbed since then?

180
00:12:36,259 --> 00:12:39,934
- Not according to the workmen, no.
- So she was buried before they were laid.

181
00:12:41,379 --> 00:12:44,770
Our prime suspect has to be
whoever lived here when she was buried.

182
00:12:45,860 --> 00:12:48,613
We need a definite date of death.

183
00:12:48,700 --> 00:12:50,850
Is there any of that soup left?

184
00:12:50,940 --> 00:12:55,730
Oh, if there is, could you get some out
to Nola Cameron? She´s still out there.

185
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:00,291
The rest of you go home.
I´ll aim to have a briefing at 10am.

186
00:13:01,141 --> 00:13:03,018
Right, guv.

187
00:13:06,701 --> 00:13:08,657
Can you get a shot of that for me?

188
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:16,056
Hands tied together at the back with...

189
00:13:17,581 --> 00:13:19,458
...a leather belt.

190
00:13:33,822 --> 00:13:35,141
Just a minute, madam.

191
00:13:35,222 --> 00:13:37,895
My daughter, Simone! Simone!

192
00:13:37,982 --> 00:13:40,372
- Simone!
- It´s all right.

193
00:13:40,463 --> 00:13:42,499
Simone!

194
00:13:51,743 --> 00:13:54,177
It was all arranged weeks ago.
I´d go with the CLO.

195
00:13:54,263 --> 00:13:57,778
I can´t back out now, but it´ll be a nightmare.

196
00:13:57,863 --> 00:14:01,982
I want you to be there.
Community centre, starts at eight.

197
00:14:04,704 --> 00:14:08,583
- No thanks, I´m trying to give up.
- Christ! Since when?

198
00:14:09,384 --> 00:14:14,902
Six days, five hours, and... about 15 minutes.

199
00:14:15,824 --> 00:14:19,261
The meeting is supposed to be
about community policing,

200
00:14:19,345 --> 00:14:20,698
but given what´s happening,

201
00:14:20,785 --> 00:14:23,583
we´ll be dragged through the shit
about the Cameron family.

202
00:14:23,665 --> 00:14:27,453
Phelps is coming down tonight.
He´s bound to have the media in tow.

203
00:14:27,545 --> 00:14:30,981
- He can smell a vote-winner for 50 miles.
- Let´s face it, guv.

204
00:14:31,065 --> 00:14:32,942
Nola may be jumping to conclusions,

205
00:14:33,025 --> 00:14:36,062
but we can´t claim
to have done well by her family.

206
00:14:36,145 --> 00:14:39,821
- Not if Derrick was fitted up.
- Let´s concentrate on the immediate problem.

207
00:14:39,906 --> 00:14:42,420
- Is it the Cameron girl or not?
- I don´t know.

208
00:14:42,506 --> 00:14:45,020
I won´t get anything from Oscar Bream
till tomorrow.

209
00:14:46,386 --> 00:14:48,104
Yep?

210
00:14:48,186 --> 00:14:50,142
Yes, I´ll hold.

211
00:14:52,186 --> 00:14:57,181
If we could find out before tonight´s meeting,
our lives would be a lot easier.

212
00:14:57,267 --> 00:15:01,704
I´ll talk to Forensics. And I want that garden
dug up in case there are any more bodies.

213
00:15:01,787 --> 00:15:04,824
Christ, what do you want -
another Nilsen? Sir!

214
00:15:06,187 --> 00:15:08,143
That´s right.

215
00:15:08,227 --> 00:15:10,946
I thought she was
the very best person for the job.

216
00:15:11,027 --> 00:15:12,938
It requires tact and...

217
00:15:16,788 --> 00:15:18,744
I´m sure she´ll be able to cope.

218
00:15:20,028 --> 00:15:21,984
I will do.

219
00:15:22,068 --> 00:15:24,024
Goodbye.

220
00:15:26,628 --> 00:15:30,382
Now, how in hell does the Commander know
what happened on your course already?

221
00:15:34,228 --> 00:15:35,628
What do you mean?

222
00:15:35,709 --> 00:15:37,984
That I brought you back to lead this inquiry.

223
00:15:39,629 --> 00:15:43,668
Well, I´ll give you one guess,
and it involves funny handshakes.

224
00:15:43,749 --> 00:15:47,378
- Thorndike? Same lodge?
- I´d put my money on it.

225
00:15:47,469 --> 00:15:49,460
Make sure you vindicate my decisión.

226
00:15:49,549 --> 00:15:51,619
I´ll do my best, sir.

227
00:16:17,431 --> 00:16:21,982
We need a name for this operation.
Where are we up to in the A to Z?

228
00:16:22,071 --> 00:16:23,789
I think it´s "N", guv.

229
00:16:23,871 --> 00:16:26,988
Look up the first "N" for us,
then, would you?

230
00:16:27,511 --> 00:16:29,149
No way, I am not opening a book.

231
00:16:29,231 --> 00:16:31,426
We could all earn a few quid.

232
00:16:31,511 --> 00:16:33,468
Because last time I was £75 out of pocket!

233
00:16:33,552 --> 00:16:35,622
You know why that was, don´t you?

234
00:16:35,712 --> 00:16:37,430
You talked me into it!

235
00:16:37,512 --> 00:16:41,425
Right, as some of you are aware,

236
00:16:41,512 --> 00:16:44,504
workmen digging in the back garden
of 15 Honeyford Road

237
00:16:44,592 --> 00:16:47,629
have uncovered skeletonised human remains.

238
00:16:47,712 --> 00:16:50,545
The hands were tied behind the back

239
00:16:50,632 --> 00:16:54,546
and the body wrapped in polythene,
so it´s definitely a suspicious death.

240
00:16:54,633 --> 00:16:59,229
Some of you will be aware
there´s a lot of speculation going on in the area

241
00:16:59,313 --> 00:17:05,024
that it could be Simone Cameron,
a local girl who went missing a few years ago.

242
00:17:05,113 --> 00:17:06,831
Put that up for me, Jonesy.

243
00:17:06,913 --> 00:17:13,149
Her mother Nola, who still lives near number 15,
is completely convinced that it´s Simone.

244
00:17:13,234 --> 00:17:18,513
I´ll get the forensic boys and the pathologists
to answer that as soon as possible.

245
00:17:18,594 --> 00:17:24,863
But in the meantime, we´ve got to take
Nola Cameron´s fears seriously.

246
00:17:24,954 --> 00:17:31,474
Unfortunately, the Cameron family have been
the centre of attention for some time now.

247
00:17:32,715 --> 00:17:35,275
The eldest boy, Derrick Cameron -
remember him?

248
00:17:35,355 --> 00:17:39,712
He was accused
of stabbing a white youth to death.

249
00:17:39,795 --> 00:17:44,994
He was sent to prison on the basis
of a confessión made here in this nick in 1985.

250
00:17:46,395 --> 00:17:50,912
Now there are doubts cast
upon the safety of that conviction.

251
00:17:50,996 --> 00:17:57,026
In fact, a campaign led by Jonathan Phelps,
Labour´s by-election candidate,

252
00:17:57,116 --> 00:18:02,349
to bring Derrick´s case before the Court
of Appeal, is gaining a lot of support.

253
00:18:02,436 --> 00:18:06,509
- So there´s a lot of anger against the police.
- There always is.

254
00:18:06,596 --> 00:18:08,712
We always take the brunt.

255
00:18:08,796 --> 00:18:11,106
We can rule out the present owners.

256
00:18:11,197 --> 00:18:14,553
So our priority is to find all former residents
of number 15.

257
00:18:14,637 --> 00:18:19,552
- Let´s get down there straight away.
- Passports at the ready!

258
00:18:19,637 --> 00:18:21,832
That´s out of order! Have you been listening?

259
00:18:21,917 --> 00:18:27,389
I don´t want the Camerons, not even
the uncles and aunts, interviewed at all.

260
00:18:27,477 --> 00:18:33,110
As far as the other residents go, if we go in there
expecting aggro, start leaning on people,

261
00:18:33,198 --> 00:18:36,873
well, we´ll get it. So it´s easy does it.

262
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:42,237
- You´re graduates of the Rank Charm School.
- Except Frank!

263
00:18:42,318 --> 00:18:45,674
I want a list of all former residents
of the Honeyford Road area

264
00:18:45,758 --> 00:18:48,398
- for the last ten years.
- Ten years?

265
00:18:48,479 --> 00:18:51,630
DS Haskons is our office manager.

266
00:18:51,719 --> 00:18:54,233
- Does he get a hat?
- Tony, have you got a name for us?

267
00:18:54,319 --> 00:18:56,879
The first "N" is Nadine St, guv.

268
00:18:56,959 --> 00:18:59,996
Nadine, very nice. So it´s Operation Nadine.

269
00:19:00,079 --> 00:19:04,391
Nadine, is it you?

270
00:19:04,919 --> 00:19:07,434
All right, come on, let´s go. Jonesy!

271
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:10,353
Go on, love. Run along. Quick!

272
00:19:10,440 --> 00:19:13,193
I´ll get all this stuff bagged up
for you as soon as possible,

273
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:15,350
so you can get Mrs Cameron to look at it.

274
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:22,036
Pullover remains.

275
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:23,917
Bra.

276
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,196
Label from her jeans.

277
00:19:26,281 --> 00:19:28,237
Pants.

278
00:19:28,841 --> 00:19:30,797
Trainers.

279
00:19:31,001 --> 00:19:33,435
And so on. Not very helpful.

280
00:19:33,521 --> 00:19:35,876
I´ve got a pair of those. Not cheap.

281
00:19:35,961 --> 00:19:39,317
Looks like a piece of skull.
Send it over to Bream.

282
00:19:39,401 --> 00:19:41,119
Adidas.

283
00:19:41,201 --> 00:19:45,559
But we have found several coins,
the most recent of which is 1986.

284
00:19:46,882 --> 00:19:50,591
But most promisingly so far,
the belt that secured her hands behind her back.

285
00:19:51,642 --> 00:19:54,873
Very distinctive buckle.
Could have belonged to her, I suppose.

286
00:19:54,962 --> 00:19:56,236
Or the killer.

287
00:20:05,883 --> 00:20:07,794
Morning. Local CID.

288
00:20:07,883 --> 00:20:10,841
Good morning. DC Lillie, local CID.

289
00:20:10,923 --> 00:20:14,711
We´re investigating
a suspicious death in this area.

290
00:20:16,603 --> 00:20:18,559
Excuse me.

291
00:20:20,243 --> 00:20:22,199
Jesus Christ, here we go.

292
00:20:22,963 --> 00:20:24,920
Shut your mouth!

293
00:20:26,124 --> 00:20:29,002
Now, calm down! Calm down! Relax!

294
00:20:37,644 --> 00:20:41,000
You wouldn´t wear them for tennis.
They´d do your ankles in.

295
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:45,080
What have we got on the property developer?

296
00:20:45,165 --> 00:20:48,874
Has since gone bankrupt and disappeared.

297
00:20:48,965 --> 00:20:50,842
Jane, a word.

298
00:20:50,925 --> 00:20:52,438
Yeah, in a minute, guv.

299
00:20:52,525 --> 00:20:54,481
My office. Now!

300
00:21:00,405 --> 00:21:02,397
Kernan the Barbarian!

301
00:21:08,886 --> 00:21:13,118
Burkin has just arrested
a young black lad for possessión.

302
00:21:13,206 --> 00:21:14,924
Oh, God!

303
00:21:15,006 --> 00:21:18,442
He´s doing his bloody house-to-house,
smells a spliff and barges in!

304
00:21:18,526 --> 00:21:20,482
Pulls the lad out by the scruff of the neck.

305
00:21:20,566 --> 00:21:22,159
I don´t believe it.

306
00:21:22,247 --> 00:21:25,125
So now we´ve got bricks
thrown into the garden at number 15,

307
00:21:25,207 --> 00:21:27,357
a reception full of people bleating on about

308
00:21:27,447 --> 00:21:30,962
infringement of civil liberties
and police harassment!

309
00:21:31,047 --> 00:21:34,517
With this bloody meeting,
I just don´t believe it!

310
00:21:34,607 --> 00:21:37,246
Shall I take Burkin off this inquiry?

311
00:21:37,327 --> 00:21:40,080
We can´t do that, Jane.
I´m up for promotion.

312
00:21:41,448 --> 00:21:42,961
Promotion?

313
00:21:43,048 --> 00:21:48,805
Chief Super. Right now,
I can´t afford to do my dirty washing in public.

314
00:21:48,888 --> 00:21:51,243
My interview would be a nightmare.

315
00:21:51,328 --> 00:21:53,558
I hope you´ll be recommending me
for your post?

316
00:21:54,568 --> 00:21:58,322
Oh, do you?
Don´t take too much for granted.

317
00:21:59,288 --> 00:22:04,886
Now, get this boy cautioned and released
and tear bloody Burkin up for arse paper!

318
00:22:04,969 --> 00:22:09,440
Guv, he was blatant, almost blowing the smoke
in my face, as if to say, "Nick me."

319
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:12,805
That´s not the point.
What with the Cameron case...

320
00:22:12,889 --> 00:22:15,881
- Cameron´s a villain, deserves to be banged up!
- Frank!

321
00:22:15,969 --> 00:22:18,039
So he had to be leaned on to confess.
So what?

322
00:22:18,129 --> 00:22:19,609
So what?

323
00:22:19,690 --> 00:22:21,760
So our reputation goes down the toilet!

324
00:22:21,850 --> 00:22:24,364
What reputation? They hate us!

325
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:28,807
I ain´t so keen on them.
One less on the streets isn´t no loss.

326
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,846
You´re making a fool of yourself.

327
00:22:30,930 --> 00:22:34,366
If they don´t want to be part of our country,
why don´t they go home?

328
00:22:34,450 --> 00:22:36,406
That´s enough, Frank! Just shut it!

329
00:22:37,770 --> 00:22:41,889
An outburst like that again,
it´ll be a disciplinary matter.

330
00:22:41,971 --> 00:22:46,647
Yeah? Then perhaps you´d better
take me off the case.

331
00:22:47,251 --> 00:22:50,288
You won´t be off the case, Frank.
You´ll be off the force.

332
00:22:52,051 --> 00:22:56,602
If you think fitting someone up cos
they´re black is OK, you shouldn´t be Old Bill.

333
00:23:01,092 --> 00:23:03,208
Yeah. I´ll be right there.

334
00:23:03,292 --> 00:23:06,602
Jesus, this is a murder investigation!

335
00:23:06,692 --> 00:23:10,571
A young girl finishes up buried
in someone´s back yard like the family cat,

336
00:23:10,652 --> 00:23:12,608
her skull smashed to pieces.

337
00:23:13,692 --> 00:23:16,047
What difference does her skin colour make?

338
00:23:17,893 --> 00:23:21,522
I want that boy cautioned and
released, and then get back to work.

339
00:23:30,853 --> 00:23:32,809
This way, Nola.

340
00:23:40,894 --> 00:23:45,604
Look at these things, and tell me
if any of them belonged to Simone.

341
00:23:45,694 --> 00:23:47,844
Yes, they are all her things.

342
00:23:47,934 --> 00:23:52,007
Nola. Take your time.
Look at them carefully.

343
00:23:53,414 --> 00:23:56,293
<i>Yes. These are her things.</i>

344
00:24:02,415 --> 00:24:07,728
We found this belt buried with her.
Do you recognise that?

345
00:24:07,815 --> 00:24:12,127
Yes. This is her belt.
She always wore this belt.

346
00:24:13,695 --> 00:24:15,414
I see.

347
00:24:20,016 --> 00:24:22,371
And what about this watch?

348
00:24:25,216 --> 00:24:27,172
That is hers.

349
00:24:27,256 --> 00:24:30,612
I bought her this watch!

350
00:24:30,696 --> 00:24:34,087
Do you want to sit down,
would you like a cup of tea?

351
00:24:34,177 --> 00:24:35,895
No, thank you.

352
00:24:35,977 --> 00:24:38,696
The experts will give us more information soon.

353
00:24:38,777 --> 00:24:42,565
Your dentist has supplied
Simone´s dental records.

354
00:24:42,657 --> 00:24:47,685
We can compare those,
and then we´ll know absolutely for sure.

355
00:24:47,777 --> 00:24:51,736
Until then, I´m afraid these things
are all we have got to go on.

356
00:24:51,817 --> 00:24:53,934
Are you sure you recognise all of them?

357
00:24:54,018 --> 00:24:56,054
Oh, yes.

358
00:24:56,858 --> 00:24:58,814
- Oh, yes.
- I see.

359
00:25:00,338 --> 00:25:02,294
Thank you very much.

360
00:25:20,139 --> 00:25:21,936
A report just in from Gold.

361
00:25:22,019 --> 00:25:25,375
He reckons Nadine´s body
was infested with maggots. Bluebottles.

362
00:25:25,459 --> 00:25:27,177
So?

363
00:25:27,259 --> 00:25:30,251
Bluebottles won´t lay eggs underground.

364
00:25:32,340 --> 00:25:35,377
So she was above ground
before she was buried?

365
00:25:35,460 --> 00:25:37,178
At least a few hours.

366
00:25:37,260 --> 00:25:42,129
And she must have been killed in the summer,
because that´s when the flies are active.

367
00:25:45,700 --> 00:25:49,010
And Simone went missing in February.

368
00:25:50,460 --> 00:25:54,136
So when I go into this meeting tonight,
I´m none the bloody wiser.

369
00:25:57,341 --> 00:26:02,131
I want Derrick Cameron´s case
to reach the Court of Appeal,

370
00:26:02,221 --> 00:26:07,295
so that someone who´s been wrongly
imprisoned for six years is released.

371
00:26:07,381 --> 00:26:09,372
The Police and Criminal Evidence Act

372
00:26:09,461 --> 00:26:14,377
brought in stricter safeguards
for the interrogating of suspects,

373
00:26:14,462 --> 00:26:16,578
but that was not much help to Derrick Cameron.

374
00:26:16,662 --> 00:26:18,892
If that means a no-go area...

375
00:26:20,782 --> 00:26:24,661
- If that means a no-go area, then...
- With respect...

376
00:26:24,742 --> 00:26:27,620
...I can´t make any such assurance.

377
00:26:27,702 --> 00:26:30,661
We don´t want to create no-go areas.

378
00:26:30,743 --> 00:26:33,462
We´ve heard
from your Community Liaison Officer,

379
00:26:33,543 --> 00:26:38,856
who is, of course, a white police officer...

380
00:26:38,943 --> 00:26:40,820
That´s a racist remark, isn´t it?

381
00:26:40,903 --> 00:26:44,452
...about sensitive policing, community policing.

382
00:26:44,543 --> 00:26:49,299
Yet once again, local people
are being treated as second-class citizens.

383
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:53,256
If you are talking
about our current investigation...

384
00:26:53,344 --> 00:26:56,256
- I am.
- ...then it is being carried out...

385
00:26:56,344 --> 00:26:58,300
In a hostile...

386
00:26:58,464 --> 00:27:02,093
...in a hostile and intimidatory manner,

387
00:27:02,184 --> 00:27:05,096
with violent arrests being made by your officers,

388
00:27:05,184 --> 00:27:07,459
though no charges were brought.

389
00:27:07,545 --> 00:27:11,220
One of my officers
was provoked into making an action

390
00:27:11,305 --> 00:27:14,217
which in retrospect can be seen as being hasty.

391
00:27:15,065 --> 00:27:19,502
Look, the most important thing is,
there´s a murderer out there walking free.

392
00:27:19,585 --> 00:27:25,023
We have to find that person.
To do that, we need the help of this community.

393
00:27:25,105 --> 00:27:29,816
Afterwards, myself and three of my colleagues
will be staying behind,

394
00:27:29,906 --> 00:27:34,616
in the hope you can give us
some crucial information.

395
00:27:34,706 --> 00:27:38,699
For example, who was staying
at 15 Honeyford Road before the Viswandhas?

396
00:27:38,786 --> 00:27:41,903
We know that!
He left when Simone went missing!

397
00:27:41,986 --> 00:27:44,102
Please, Mrs Cameron...

398
00:27:44,186 --> 00:27:45,380
Please!

399
00:27:45,466 --> 00:27:47,378
What was his name? Somebody!

400
00:27:47,467 --> 00:27:52,461
I would like to ask Mr Kernan
about the heavy police presence

401
00:27:52,547 --> 00:27:55,459
in the Honeyford Road area at the moment.

402
00:27:55,547 --> 00:27:59,779
I´d like to ask him how
he´s got the front to come here in the first place,

403
00:27:59,867 --> 00:28:04,543
when Derrick Cameron´s banged up
for something he didn´t do!

404
00:28:07,268 --> 00:28:09,224
Let him answer!

405
00:28:09,908 --> 00:28:12,706
I cannot discuss the details of that case,

406
00:28:12,788 --> 00:28:17,578
but I would have thought my presence here is
indication of good faith.

407
00:28:20,308 --> 00:28:24,267
The justifiable anger and unhappiness

408
00:28:24,348 --> 00:28:26,340
at what has happened to Derrick Cameron...

409
00:28:26,429 --> 00:28:31,787
cannot be so easily dismissed by a police officer
stationed at Southampton Row.

410
00:28:31,869 --> 00:28:35,908
- I´m not dismissing...
- This is the fundamental question!

411
00:28:35,989 --> 00:28:40,221
Is it possible to expect justice in this country...

412
00:28:40,309 --> 00:28:43,062
if you are a person of colour?

413
00:28:50,430 --> 00:28:52,386
Allen. A-L-L-E-N.

414
00:28:59,670 --> 00:29:02,548
Listen, I don´t like the police.

415
00:29:02,630 --> 00:29:03,984
Thank you.

416
00:29:04,071 --> 00:29:08,587
But I tell you this, you should talk to the guy
that Nola mentioned.

417
00:29:08,671 --> 00:29:13,461
- Yeah?
- White guy about 50. Worked as a builder.

418
00:29:13,551 --> 00:29:15,064
Can you give me his name, sir?

419
00:29:15,151 --> 00:29:18,029
We argued about parking space.

420
00:29:18,111 --> 00:29:22,867
And in the morning
all my car was covered in brake fluid.

421
00:29:22,952 --> 00:29:25,944
But don´t worry, I got my own back.

422
00:29:26,032 --> 00:29:27,988
Go on, then, tell me.

423
00:29:29,272 --> 00:29:30,864
I pissed in his petrol tank!

424
00:29:37,592 --> 00:29:42,462
Dave Hardy or Hartley. Something like that.

425
00:29:54,793 --> 00:30:01,029
Word is a family called Allen lived at No.13.
They might have owned No.17 as well.

426
00:30:01,114 --> 00:30:06,393
Esme Allen still runs a West Indian takeaway
which is nearby.

427
00:30:06,474 --> 00:30:12,071
Great. Give it another half an hour here,
and then call it a day.

428
00:30:58,276 --> 00:31:04,466
My son study for his school exam,
my daughter Sarah study law at university.

429
00:31:04,557 --> 00:31:10,029
Them think the worid´s at them feet.
They´ll never scrub floor or take out rubbish!

430
00:31:10,117 --> 00:31:13,712
Let´s hope
they don´t come down to earth with a bump!

431
00:31:13,797 --> 00:31:15,515
Mrs Esme Allen?

432
00:31:15,597 --> 00:31:17,315
Yes, dear?

433
00:31:17,397 --> 00:31:19,389
I´m DCI Jane Tennison.

434
00:31:19,918 --> 00:31:24,514
It´s not bad news? Has someone
been hurt? Sarah? Tony?

435
00:31:24,598 --> 00:31:28,591
It´s OK.
We´re just making some inquiries.

436
00:31:28,678 --> 00:31:32,796
My Lord! You gave me a fright!
Is it about that poor Cameron girl?

437
00:31:32,878 --> 00:31:35,517
Yes, that´s right. In a way it is.

438
00:31:35,598 --> 00:31:38,352
Is there somewhere more private?

439
00:31:38,439 --> 00:31:41,033
Take the lady downstairs.
I´ll look after the shop.

440
00:31:41,119 --> 00:31:43,349
All right. Come this way.

441
00:31:45,319 --> 00:31:51,030
I understand that in the ´80s, you and your
husband used to own No.15 Honeyford Road.

442
00:31:51,119 --> 00:31:53,075
Yes, that´s right.

443
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:55,993
But you lived at No.17 with your family.

444
00:31:56,080 --> 00:31:58,036
Yes.

445
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:05,629
I´m sorry to tell you this, but a body has been
found buried in the back garden of No.15.

446
00:32:05,720 --> 00:32:07,278
My God.

447
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:11,836
So we´re very anxious
to trace the former occupant.

448
00:32:11,920 --> 00:32:15,037
You think he killed poor Simone?

449
00:32:15,120 --> 00:32:20,912
We just want to eliminate him from our inquiries.
What was his name?

450
00:32:21,001 --> 00:32:22,957
David Harvey.

451
00:32:26,481 --> 00:32:29,200
And do you have any idea where he lives now?

452
00:32:29,281 --> 00:32:32,990
No. My husband might know, but...

453
00:32:34,361 --> 00:32:38,196
We tried not to have anything to do with him.

454
00:32:38,282 --> 00:32:41,797
I wouldn´t let my daughter go near that house.

455
00:32:41,882 --> 00:32:47,036
We all knew what he was like,
particularly with young giris.

456
00:32:47,122 --> 00:32:50,831
He wasn´t always like that,
but after his wife died...

457
00:32:50,922 --> 00:32:56,202
I thought they were a lovely couple,
but after she´d gone,

458
00:32:56,283 --> 00:33:00,913
drinking and cursing and, you know, carrying on.

459
00:33:01,883 --> 00:33:06,035
I´d better speak to your husband
and whole family as soon as possible.

460
00:33:06,123 --> 00:33:10,639
- Yes. We´ll all be there this evening.
- Fine, thank you.

461
00:33:10,723 --> 00:33:14,876
It´s Harvey. Not Hardy, not Harley. Harvey.
H- A-R-V-E-Y.

462
00:33:14,964 --> 00:33:19,799
We´ve got to start again.
I´m going to see Oscar Bream.

463
00:33:23,164 --> 00:33:28,192
It makes a pleasant change, not being
up to the armpits in someone´s viscera.

464
00:33:28,284 --> 00:33:33,313
Though this girlie is sorely taxing
my memory of anatomy classes.

465
00:33:33,405 --> 00:33:39,355
There are 206 named bones of the body.
26 to each foot for a kick-off.

466
00:33:39,445 --> 00:33:44,599
Luckily, most of those
were still inside her plimsolls.

467
00:33:44,685 --> 00:33:48,360
Fascinating, Oscar, but is it Simone Cameron?

468
00:33:48,445 --> 00:33:50,401
Absolutely not.

469
00:33:50,885 --> 00:33:52,604
What?

470
00:33:52,686 --> 00:33:54,597
As I said,

471
00:33:54,686 --> 00:33:59,077
like Simone, in her teens, 15 to 16, but taller.

472
00:34:00,006 --> 00:34:04,397
Simone was 5´7". This girl is 5´8", 5´9".

473
00:34:05,526 --> 00:34:10,680
It looks as if she was all there,
no mutilation. Good head of hair.

474
00:34:12,047 --> 00:34:15,164
Luckily, Paul here likes jigsaws.

475
00:34:18,927 --> 00:34:21,043
Bit of the zygomatic arch?

476
00:34:21,127 --> 00:34:23,083
Are you sure that it´s not Simone?

477
00:34:23,167 --> 00:34:25,123
Yeah.

478
00:34:30,488 --> 00:34:32,558
Want me to point out the differences?

479
00:34:32,648 --> 00:34:34,366
No, thank you.

480
00:34:34,448 --> 00:34:37,918
Fractured her wrist when she was younger.

481
00:34:38,008 --> 00:34:42,126
Playing netball? Fell off her bike?
That´s for you to discover.

482
00:34:42,208 --> 00:34:43,880
Don´t rub it in.

483
00:34:43,968 --> 00:34:46,038
Do you know if she´s black or white?

484
00:34:46,128 --> 00:34:48,847
- No.
- Shit!

485
00:34:48,928 --> 00:34:51,238
I´ve been going up a dead end.

486
00:34:51,329 --> 00:34:56,642
We´ve got a man who can do jiggery-pokery
with the skull to ascertain ethnic origins.

487
00:34:56,729 --> 00:35:01,678
Better still, a medical artist
who could make you a clay head at a price.

488
00:35:03,009 --> 00:35:04,124
Is he good?

489
00:35:04,209 --> 00:35:06,848
He´s our very own Auguste Rodin.

490
00:35:06,929 --> 00:35:07,964
Yeah, but is he good?

491
00:35:08,049 --> 00:35:09,768
Naturellement.

492
00:35:09,850 --> 00:35:11,169
That´s expensive, right?

493
00:35:11,250 --> 00:35:13,684
Do you want to put it to Kernan?

494
00:35:13,770 --> 00:35:16,603
- No, sod it. Let´s do it.
- OK.

495
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:18,965
How long before I get it?

496
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,928
- Three weeks?
- Fine.

497
00:35:22,010 --> 00:35:23,762
I´ll pick it up in three days.

498
00:35:23,850 --> 00:35:28,322
I´ll talk to him.
Perhaps if you were prepared to model nude?

499
00:35:28,411 --> 00:35:29,890
That´s sexual harassment.

500
00:35:29,971 --> 00:35:31,962
What isn´t these days?

501
00:35:34,851 --> 00:35:36,603
How did she die, Oscar?

502
00:35:36,691 --> 00:35:38,647
No idea.

503
00:35:38,731 --> 00:35:42,690
The skull could have been smashed after death.

504
00:35:42,771 --> 00:35:45,763
For all I know, she could have been buried alive.

505
00:35:47,292 --> 00:35:48,805
DA Harvey.

506
00:35:49,652 --> 00:35:53,486
No, Harvey. That´s H-A-R-V-E-Y.

507
00:35:53,572 --> 00:35:55,688
When can you confirm it?

508
00:35:55,972 --> 00:35:58,645
Yeah, it´s just I´m trying...

509
00:36:00,492 --> 00:36:02,722
I´m gonna do some myself.

510
00:36:03,252 --> 00:36:04,765
Have you got anything for me?

511
00:36:04,852 --> 00:36:06,571
Nothing so far, boss.

512
00:36:06,653 --> 00:36:10,771
But we´ve got more stuff from No.15.
Jonesy´s getting it.

513
00:36:10,853 --> 00:36:13,083
Let´s hope it´s good, then.

514
00:36:13,733 --> 00:36:19,330
Right, listen up. I´ve just come
from Oscar Bream at the path lab.

515
00:36:19,413 --> 00:36:22,723
It´s definitely not Simone Cameron.

516
00:36:24,813 --> 00:36:29,524
So we operate on two fronts:
Find David Harvey and identify "Nadine".

517
00:36:29,614 --> 00:36:33,687
It´s a bottle of Scotch
for whoever gets David Harvey.

518
00:36:33,774 --> 00:36:37,483
Guv. They found a plastic bag buried, as well.

519
00:36:37,574 --> 00:36:43,092
Gold has definitely linked it to the girl.
It contained this.

520
00:36:43,854 --> 00:36:47,450
The cloth is West African. Several yards of it.

521
00:36:48,375 --> 00:36:52,004
And those ivory bracelets are Nigerian.

522
00:36:54,055 --> 00:37:00,244
Yoruba amulets, supposed to ward off
evil spirits. Didn´t work for "Nadine".

523
00:37:00,335 --> 00:37:03,532
They´re very old and very valuable

524
00:37:14,096 --> 00:37:16,530
May I talk to Esme, your mum?

525
00:37:17,136 --> 00:37:19,127
Yes, please wait here.

526
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:22,813
Mum, someone´s at the door for you.

527
00:37:27,697 --> 00:37:29,096
Hello, it´s Jane Tennison.

528
00:37:29,177 --> 00:37:31,133
Yes, come in.

529
00:37:33,537 --> 00:37:35,493
This way.

530
00:37:35,857 --> 00:37:37,813
This is my son Tony.

531
00:37:39,257 --> 00:37:40,167
Hello, Tony.

532
00:37:40,257 --> 00:37:42,931
And his daughter Cleo. Say hello, Cleo.

533
00:37:43,018 --> 00:37:44,736
Hello.

534
00:37:44,818 --> 00:37:49,209
Tony and his girlfriend
are doing the decent thing at long last.

535
00:37:49,298 --> 00:37:54,895
Their daughter is to be a bridesmaid.
Lord, how times have changed!

536
00:37:54,978 --> 00:37:56,491
You wanted to see my husband?

537
00:37:56,578 --> 00:37:58,534
Yes, please. Thank you.

538
00:38:01,979 --> 00:38:04,209
So when´s the happy day, Tony?

539
00:38:04,299 --> 00:38:05,414
Uh...

540
00:38:05,499 --> 00:38:07,455
Do you like my dress?

541
00:38:08,099 --> 00:38:09,657
Yes, I do.

542
00:38:10,539 --> 00:38:12,131
I think that´s lovely.

543
00:38:13,299 --> 00:38:19,010
Tony, just a minute.
Could you have a look at this for me, please?

544
00:38:22,100 --> 00:38:24,056
That´s a description of the dead girl.

545
00:38:24,140 --> 00:38:28,736
Do you remember seeing anyone like that
in this area in the mid ´80s?

546
00:38:28,820 --> 00:38:32,017
- She might have been at school with you.
- I´m a bridesmaid.

547
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,056
You are, aren´t you?

548
00:38:34,940 --> 00:38:36,931
Have you ever been a bridesmaid?

549
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,853
Yes, I have, but never the bride.

550
00:38:39,940 --> 00:38:41,056
No.

551
00:38:41,141 --> 00:38:43,097
Come along, baby. Say bye-bye.

552
00:38:43,181 --> 00:38:45,137
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

553
00:38:51,821 --> 00:38:53,777
Wedding boy!

554
00:38:55,541 --> 00:38:57,497
What can I do for you?

555
00:38:58,861 --> 00:39:02,252
And you have no idea
where David Aloysius Harvey lives now?

556
00:39:02,342 --> 00:39:04,219
I´m afraid not.

557
00:39:04,302 --> 00:39:08,659
- You bought this property in 1989, right?
- Yes.

558
00:39:09,742 --> 00:39:13,530
And Mr Harvey obviously moved in
shortly afterwards.

559
00:39:13,622 --> 00:39:15,578
With his wife.

560
00:39:15,662 --> 00:39:19,258
After she died, he let things go.

561
00:39:22,463 --> 00:39:27,378
Then you sold the property in 1989
with Mr Harvey as a sitting tenant.

562
00:39:27,463 --> 00:39:30,341
Did that lead to any bad feeling
between you and Mr Harvey?

563
00:39:31,063 --> 00:39:32,621
Some.

564
00:39:37,303 --> 00:39:39,022
Not much.

565
00:39:39,104 --> 00:39:44,132
The problem we had was that
he was very erratic in paying the rent.

566
00:39:44,224 --> 00:39:47,773
Sometimes he had money, sometimes not.

567
00:39:49,104 --> 00:39:51,743
I presume you had a set of keys to No.15?

568
00:39:51,824 --> 00:39:53,143
Yes.

569
00:39:53,224 --> 00:39:56,660
Did you do anything to the garden
as the owner?

570
00:39:56,744 --> 00:39:58,861
No. Harvey laid the slabs.

571
00:39:58,945 --> 00:40:03,541
I didn´t want him to,
but he did very much as he pleased.

572
00:40:03,625 --> 00:40:05,820
And when were those slabs laid?

573
00:40:06,905 --> 00:40:09,897
I´d say... 1986, ´87?

574
00:40:09,985 --> 00:40:15,264
Because it´s almost certain that body was buried
before the slabs went down.

575
00:40:15,345 --> 00:40:17,064
Yes.

576
00:40:17,146 --> 00:40:19,102
I can see that.

577
00:40:19,986 --> 00:40:24,184
Mr Allen, how can you afford two properties
with your pay?

578
00:40:24,266 --> 00:40:27,383
Esme´s cafe has always done well.

579
00:40:28,786 --> 00:40:32,859
It was her money that paid the second
mortgage.

580
00:40:32,946 --> 00:40:34,902
And your son´s at public school?

581
00:40:34,986 --> 00:40:36,943
That´s right.

582
00:40:37,507 --> 00:40:39,259
When will you ever learn, Pop?

583
00:40:39,347 --> 00:40:44,137
Black people aren´t supposed to own
businesses, houses, get an education...

584
00:40:44,227 --> 00:40:46,502
This is my daughter Sarah.

585
00:40:46,587 --> 00:40:49,101
Now, there´s no need to be rude.

586
00:40:49,187 --> 00:40:51,143
I agree.

587
00:40:52,467 --> 00:40:57,258
Sarah, you´re the law student. And you´re 20.

588
00:40:57,348 --> 00:41:02,945
So that means in the summer of, say,
1986, you would have been...

589
00:41:03,228 --> 00:41:04,422
Um...

590
00:41:04,508 --> 00:41:08,296
14. Mathematics not your strong point?

591
00:41:08,388 --> 00:41:10,458
Not particularly, no.

592
00:41:10,548 --> 00:41:14,144
It´s my son David who´s a wizard at maths.

593
00:41:15,229 --> 00:41:21,259
Did you ever see anyone like this
in the vicinity of Honeyford Road?

594
00:41:21,349 --> 00:41:23,988
Yes, of course. Simone Cameron.

595
00:41:24,069 --> 00:41:29,348
No, it´s not Simone. We´re sure about that.
Please look at the description.

596
00:41:33,270 --> 00:41:35,909
Well, then, if it´s not Simone,

597
00:41:35,990 --> 00:41:38,868
you´ll need to be a bit more specific, won´t you?

598
00:41:38,950 --> 00:41:40,349
That´s if you can be bothered.

599
00:41:40,430 --> 00:41:42,307
And what does that mean?

600
00:41:42,390 --> 00:41:47,589
Well, the police aren´t exactly
noted for their... enthusiasm

601
00:41:47,670 --> 00:41:52,221
when it comes to solving cases
when the victim is black, are they?

602
00:41:52,310 --> 00:41:55,348
Was she black? It doesn´t say so here.

603
00:41:57,791 --> 00:42:00,589
Maybe it´s you who´s jumping to conclusions.

604
00:42:07,551 --> 00:42:09,985
When´s the happy day, Tony?

605
00:42:12,912 --> 00:42:14,868
Two weeks away now.

606
00:42:15,952 --> 00:42:20,468
Well, I´ll see you before then.
Thanks for your help.

607
00:42:20,552 --> 00:42:23,510
- Bye-bye. Thank you.
- Take care.

608
00:42:41,113 --> 00:42:43,502
Got anything on David Harvey yet?

609
00:42:43,593 --> 00:42:45,549
Not yet, guv.

610
00:42:46,393 --> 00:42:51,024
We´ve tried the electoral roll,
NHS, DSS, rates...

611
00:42:51,754 --> 00:42:54,985
I´ve just finished working my way
through the phone book.

612
00:43:05,754 --> 00:43:09,748
You know, Vernon said
he was erratic on paying his rent.

613
00:43:09,835 --> 00:43:12,395
Did you check the credit-reference agencies?

614
00:43:13,515 --> 00:43:15,471
No.

615
00:43:58,637 --> 00:43:59,911
Yes!

616
00:43:59,997 --> 00:44:01,953
Well done, boss.

617
00:44:05,077 --> 00:44:07,069
Mrs Eileen Reynolds.

618
00:44:07,158 --> 00:44:09,194
Got a pen?

619
00:44:11,758 --> 00:44:13,476
Fancy a drink?

620
00:44:13,558 --> 00:44:15,549
I should go home, really.

621
00:44:15,638 --> 00:44:18,232
Right, the twins. Off you go.

622
00:44:18,318 --> 00:44:20,991
- Night.
- Night, Richard.

623
00:44:29,439 --> 00:44:31,395
Got you! Got you.

624
00:44:41,839 --> 00:44:44,797
They´ve done the tests on the skull.

625
00:44:44,879 --> 00:44:49,556
"Nadine" was of mixed race,
West African and probably English.

626
00:44:49,640 --> 00:44:52,837
That explains the Nigerian bracelets, then.

627
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:56,754
Let´s see what David Harvey´s got to say.

628
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,400
Jesus, I hope the lift´s working.

629
00:45:04,400 --> 00:45:08,076
You know,
you ought to give up smoking cigarettes.

630
00:45:09,521 --> 00:45:13,673
Makes you feel a whole lot better.
Ah, here we are.

631
00:45:13,761 --> 00:45:16,321
There´s nothing worse
than a born-again nonsmoker.

632
00:45:28,002 --> 00:45:29,355
David Harvey?

633
00:45:29,442 --> 00:45:30,591
Yes.

634
00:45:31,522 --> 00:45:34,798
We´re police officers.
Can we have a word with you, please?

635
00:45:39,042 --> 00:45:41,192
So why did you move away, Mr Harvey?

636
00:45:41,282 --> 00:45:43,638
Had my first heart attack.

637
00:45:45,003 --> 00:45:49,235
After I left hospital, I came here
to be closer to Eileen, my sister.

638
00:45:49,323 --> 00:45:54,238
I didn´t want to live there anyway,
not after my wife died.

639
00:45:54,323 --> 00:45:58,077
I only stayed on
because a big darky wanted rid of me so badly.

640
00:45:59,563 --> 00:46:03,637
I should never have moved to this dump.
I´m a bloody prisoner.

641
00:46:03,724 --> 00:46:09,435
Lift´s always on the blink,
the place is full of junkies and pimps.

642
00:46:11,884 --> 00:46:14,444
That´s her. That´s the wife.

643
00:46:14,524 --> 00:46:19,314
She was the gardener.
Lovely garden when she was alive.

644
00:46:19,404 --> 00:46:22,556
I tried to keep it going after...

645
00:46:23,525 --> 00:46:25,004
Oh, well. You know.

646
00:46:26,125 --> 00:46:28,559
In the end, I paved it over.

647
00:46:29,805 --> 00:46:32,922
I can tell you exactly when, as well.

648
00:46:36,765 --> 00:46:40,201
I hired some stonecutting equipment.

649
00:46:41,766 --> 00:46:43,722
Ah.

650
00:46:44,606 --> 00:46:46,562
There you go.

651
00:46:49,806 --> 00:46:51,762
Last week in August.

652
00:46:53,646 --> 00:46:57,639
It was during all that week that I did the digging.

653
00:46:58,606 --> 00:47:02,043
Took up the grass, levelled it all off.

654
00:47:02,127 --> 00:47:06,279
I´d laid about half the slabs by the Saturday,

655
00:47:06,367 --> 00:47:09,757
stayed with Eileen Sunday morning,
stayed on till the Monday.

656
00:47:11,047 --> 00:47:12,605
And Eileen lives locally?

657
00:47:12,687 --> 00:47:15,326
Now, but in those days she lived in Margate.

658
00:47:15,407 --> 00:47:18,717
Anyway, when I got home on the Monday...

659
00:47:18,807 --> 00:47:23,120
I finished laying the rest of the slabs
and cemented them in.

660
00:47:24,248 --> 00:47:28,844
So, the only time
the house was left unattended was...

661
00:47:28,928 --> 00:47:32,398
That must have been on Sunday 31 st August.

662
00:47:32,488 --> 00:47:34,160
That´s right.

663
00:47:43,849 --> 00:47:47,398
- Notice anything unusual when you got back?
- Unusual?

664
00:47:47,489 --> 00:47:50,845
No-one else had been digging in the garden?
No extra earth anywhere?

665
00:47:51,929 --> 00:47:53,078
No.

666
00:47:55,569 --> 00:48:00,963
I must say, if someone asked me what I was
doing on the last weekend in August 1986,

667
00:48:01,050 --> 00:48:02,688
I don´t think I could remember.

668
00:48:02,770 --> 00:48:04,886
How can you recollect so clearly?

669
00:48:05,930 --> 00:48:08,888
Because my wife died on that day
the year before.

670
00:48:11,450 --> 00:48:13,406
Oh, I see.

671
00:48:15,690 --> 00:48:20,446
Eileen asked me down to stay with her
so I wouldn´t be on my own.

672
00:48:20,531 --> 00:48:22,169
Oh, that´ll be my lunch.

673
00:48:23,611 --> 00:48:26,569
I spend that weekend with her every year.

674
00:48:26,651 --> 00:48:31,008
Couldn´t manage without her.
She always sends my food over.

675
00:48:31,091 --> 00:48:33,730
Good. My colleague will want to speak to her.

676
00:48:33,811 --> 00:48:37,441
It´s not her. This is my nephew, Jason.

677
00:48:37,532 --> 00:48:38,851
What´s going on?

678
00:48:38,932 --> 00:48:40,604
We´re police officers.

679
00:48:40,692 --> 00:48:43,968
You´re certain you don´t recognise her?

680
00:48:44,052 --> 00:48:47,761
- What do you want with my uncle?
- Quite sure. I´ll tell you later.

681
00:48:47,852 --> 00:48:48,921
You know he´s not well?

682
00:48:49,012 --> 00:48:51,480
I´m fine, don´t worry about it.

683
00:48:51,572 --> 00:48:52,925
What´s all this about?

684
00:48:53,012 --> 00:48:55,401
Your uncle will tell you after we´ve gone, Jason.

685
00:48:55,492 --> 00:48:59,281
Thank you very much, Mr Harvey.
We´ll show ourselves out.

686
00:49:00,493 --> 00:49:05,009
- Lying bastard. He´d learnt his alibi by heart!
- Yeah, right.

687
00:49:05,093 --> 00:49:10,326
He didn´t shuffle six years ago. If he could lay
those slabs, he could smash a young girI´s skull.

688
00:49:10,413 --> 00:49:15,010
We´d better get a move on, then,
before David Aloysius Harvey dies on us.

689
00:49:26,734 --> 00:49:27,803
Where´s DCI Tennison?

690
00:49:27,894 --> 00:49:29,885
Following up a lead, guv.

691
00:49:29,974 --> 00:49:31,930
OK.

692
00:49:33,334 --> 00:49:36,452
Can I have your attention, please?

693
00:49:37,135 --> 00:49:40,730
This is Detective Sergeant Bob Oswalde.

694
00:49:40,815 --> 00:49:46,412
Bob´s joined us from West End Lane
to assist on Operation Nadine.

695
00:50:03,456 --> 00:50:05,606
Where´s the medical artist studio?

696
00:50:05,696 --> 00:50:07,652
First on the left.

697
00:50:14,577 --> 00:50:17,296
- Hello.
- Hi.

698
00:50:17,377 --> 00:50:20,608
I´m DCI Tennison. I believe
you´re making a clay head for me?

699
00:50:20,697 --> 00:50:22,653
Come in.

700
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:32,048
It may not look like much at the moment,
but... I have high hopes.

701
00:50:33,858 --> 00:50:36,133
She had the most beautiful skull I´ve ever seen.

702
00:50:36,218 --> 00:50:37,936
Really?

703
00:50:38,018 --> 00:50:39,690
Oh, yes. See this?

704
00:50:39,778 --> 00:50:44,852
The orbicularis oris.
The muscle overlays the maxilla and mandible,

705
00:50:44,938 --> 00:50:48,772
on the eminences
due to the incisor and canine teeth.

706
00:50:48,858 --> 00:50:51,498
Its fibres surround the oral aperture.

707
00:50:51,579 --> 00:50:56,733
Function: Closing of the mouth
and pursing of lips.

708
00:50:58,539 --> 00:51:03,408
I´m a scientist. Otherwise, I´d say it´s the muscle
that allows you to kiss someone.

709
00:51:05,979 --> 00:51:07,970
When will she be ready?

710
00:51:10,620 --> 00:51:12,611
By the end of the week.

711
00:51:15,220 --> 00:51:17,814
- Hang on, hang on, why me?
- Bob needs a desk.

712
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,539
No, that´s not an answer. Why me?

713
00:51:20,620 --> 00:51:23,498
Because you´re only ever at your desk
to drink coffee.

714
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:27,175
Cos I´m out making sure
the streets are safe to walk!

715
00:51:27,260 --> 00:51:28,978
Superlillie!

716
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:32,974
What is happening? Bad enough policing them,
let alone working with them.

717
00:51:33,061 --> 00:51:35,495
Just cos he´s taller than you.

718
00:51:35,581 --> 00:51:37,537
No, he ain´t!

719
00:51:39,621 --> 00:51:43,375
Can you shut up and get on with some work?

720
00:51:52,102 --> 00:51:54,855
Tony, can I have a word, please?

721
00:52:02,662 --> 00:52:04,618
Yes, guv?

722
00:52:05,462 --> 00:52:07,180
What´s Bob Oswalde doing here?

723
00:52:07,262 --> 00:52:08,981
Why? Do you know him?

724
00:52:09,063 --> 00:52:11,258
Answer the question, Tony.

725
00:52:11,343 --> 00:52:14,460
He´s part of the team. Kernan brought him in.

726
00:52:14,543 --> 00:52:16,499
Thank you.

727
00:52:23,703 --> 00:52:24,692
Jane.

728
00:52:24,783 --> 00:52:27,217
I want a word with you, guv. Now.

729
00:52:27,304 --> 00:52:29,260
Thank you, Sharon.

730
00:52:33,144 --> 00:52:36,773
What do you mean by co-opting someone onto
my team without telling me?

731
00:52:36,864 --> 00:52:43,258
It seemed to me that a black officer
would be a... How can I put it? A useful addition.

732
00:52:43,344 --> 00:52:45,096
Why didn´t you consult with me?

733
00:52:45,184 --> 00:52:48,257
Actually, I consulted
the Community Liaison Officer,

734
00:52:48,345 --> 00:52:50,142
who thought it was an excellent idea.

735
00:52:50,225 --> 00:52:54,184
A black face prominent in this inquiry,
an antidote to the Burkins of this worid.

736
00:52:54,265 --> 00:52:56,904
- Are you saying you can´t use an extra man?
- No.

737
00:52:56,985 --> 00:53:00,455
- Then what are you saying?
- He wasn´t in the original team.

738
00:53:00,545 --> 00:53:03,423
Now if I ask him to do something,
it can be misinterpreted.

739
00:53:03,505 --> 00:53:04,858
I don´t understand.

740
00:53:04,945 --> 00:53:08,780
It smacks of tokenism, political manoeuvring.

741
00:53:08,866 --> 00:53:12,654
You should have asked me.
Pulling rank undermines me.

742
00:53:12,746 --> 00:53:16,375
- I was just trying to help.
- Oh, bollocks!

743
00:53:17,586 --> 00:53:18,939
Sir.

744
00:53:19,026 --> 00:53:21,460
You can´t work with the man?

745
00:53:21,546 --> 00:53:23,377
Yes, I can work with him.

746
00:53:23,466 --> 00:53:26,425
- My sources say he´s a good officier.
- Yes, I´m sure he is.

747
00:53:26,507 --> 00:53:28,225
What have you got against him?

748
00:53:28,307 --> 00:53:33,301
Nothing. Well, we didn´t hit it off particularly well
on the course.

749
00:53:33,387 --> 00:53:34,820
I don´t want you to marry him!

750
00:53:34,907 --> 00:53:36,260
I don´t want him on my team!

751
00:53:36,347 --> 00:53:40,499
He´s on the team already. I´ve made my decisión
and I´m not going back on it.

752
00:53:40,587 --> 00:53:42,782
Get the man briefed and put him to work!

753
00:53:45,028 --> 00:53:47,781
We´ll review the situation at the end of the week.

754
00:53:48,868 --> 00:53:52,907
I´ll be watching the progress of this case
very carefully from now on.

755
00:53:58,828 --> 00:54:01,501
Do you expect me to believe
this is a coincidence?

756
00:54:01,588 --> 00:54:05,741
No. How many black detectives
did he have to choose from?

757
00:54:05,829 --> 00:54:11,267
It´s nothing to do with me.
I wouldn´t ask to be the token black.

758
00:54:11,349 --> 00:54:16,343
Don´t think what happened on that course
gives you any special privileges.

759
00:54:16,429 --> 00:54:18,306
I don´t.

760
00:54:18,389 --> 00:54:19,788
Don´t you dare tell anyone.

761
00:54:19,869 --> 00:54:21,666
Jane, what do you take me for?

762
00:54:21,749 --> 00:54:23,468
Don´t call me Jane!

763
00:54:23,550 --> 00:54:25,268
Give me some credit.

764
00:54:25,350 --> 00:54:29,502
What happened, happened. It´s gone.
Long since forgotten about.

765
00:54:29,590 --> 00:54:31,820
Let´s not give it another thought.

766
00:54:35,110 --> 00:54:37,066
Yes.

767
00:54:37,150 --> 00:54:43,101
Right. I´ll see you in back in the incident room.
I´ll be along in a minute.

768
00:55:00,391 --> 00:55:03,509
We could have the clay head tomorrow.
End of the week, at the latest.

769
00:55:03,592 --> 00:55:08,905
So, after talking to Harvey, let´s concentrate
on Sunday 31 st August, 1986.

770
00:55:08,992 --> 00:55:10,869
Has Harvey got an alibi?

771
00:55:10,952 --> 00:55:14,740
Yeah, his sister Eileen. I´ll see her shortly.

772
00:55:14,832 --> 00:55:16,550
But what we need now is a name,

773
00:55:16,632 --> 00:55:21,388
to build up "Nadine´s" life story.
Then we can connect her to Harvey.

774
00:55:21,473 --> 00:55:26,467
A couple of statements talk about
a girl staying in the basement at No.15.

775
00:55:26,553 --> 00:55:29,625
- Really?
- Conflicting reports, but it could have been ´86.

776
00:55:29,713 --> 00:55:31,431
Brilliant.

777
00:55:31,513 --> 00:55:34,391
Better start on missing persons.
Bob, handle that, please.

778
00:55:34,473 --> 00:55:39,707
Tony, speak with Harvey´s consultant.
Check he´s not just a bloody good actor.

779
00:55:39,794 --> 00:55:41,512
If he is, he should win an Oscar.

780
00:55:41,594 --> 00:55:43,346
Yeah, right. That´s it for now.

781
00:55:44,394 --> 00:55:48,592
Nice one. I´m glad to see the boss
is keeping our coloured friend in his place.

782
00:55:53,794 --> 00:55:56,513
Guv. Can I put someone else on mispers?

783
00:55:56,594 --> 00:55:58,312
Why?

784
00:55:58,394 --> 00:56:00,909
Ma´am, it´s ridiculous, a man of his experience...

785
00:56:00,995 --> 00:56:05,830
No. He might find something
a more junior man might miss.

786
00:56:05,915 --> 00:56:07,871
Don´t call me "ma´am".

787
00:56:15,515 --> 00:56:17,028
Of course I´m sure!

788
00:56:17,115 --> 00:56:21,587
Every year since his Jeanie died.
He wouldn´t have left until the Monday morning.

789
00:56:21,676 --> 00:56:25,191
He´s a sick man. You shouldn´t hound him.

790
00:56:25,276 --> 00:56:28,985
- Mum, they have got their job to do.
- He´s waiting for an operation, you know.

791
00:56:29,076 --> 00:56:30,589
You´ll be the bloody death of him.

792
00:56:30,676 --> 00:56:33,748
We´re trying to eliminate him from our inquiries.

793
00:56:33,836 --> 00:56:37,466
You wouldn´t hound him like this
if he was a black man!

794
00:56:37,557 --> 00:56:40,151
I´ve questioned your brother once, that´s all,

795
00:56:40,237 --> 00:56:43,593
which is not surprising, considering
a body was found in his garden.

796
00:56:43,677 --> 00:56:49,752
Rubbish! "Simone Cameron" this,
"Simone Cameron" that!

797
00:56:49,837 --> 00:56:52,271
- Was it Simone?
- No.

798
00:56:52,357 --> 00:56:58,672
Exactly. It´s my brother you should
be concerned about. He´s the one that´s dying!

799
00:56:58,758 --> 00:57:00,874
- Is that all for now?
- Yes. Thanks for coming.

800
00:57:00,958 --> 00:57:02,471
Come on, Mum.

801
00:57:02,558 --> 00:57:04,276
Don´t pull me about!

802
00:57:05,358 --> 00:57:08,987
Well, he´s in the hospital tomorrow,
thanks to you!

803
00:57:10,358 --> 00:57:11,916
Mum.

804
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:22,956
One last thing. You said you and Mr
Harvey fell out because he wouldn´t move.

805
00:57:23,039 --> 00:57:24,757
Yes.

806
00:57:24,839 --> 00:57:26,716
Is there nothing else?

807
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:29,359
What? No.

808
00:57:30,479 --> 00:57:33,118
But didn´t he sublet the basement
to a girl?

809
00:57:33,199 --> 00:57:34,837
That had nothing to do with me.

810
00:57:34,919 --> 00:57:36,751
What had nothing to do with you?

811
00:57:36,840 --> 00:57:40,355
- Whatever she was doing.
- And what was she doing?

812
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:43,989
I don´t know, it was none of my business!

813
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:48,119
It was if she was a prostitute, Vernon.

814
00:57:51,840 --> 00:57:52,989
Why?

815
00:57:53,080 --> 00:57:56,596
As the landlord, you could have been done
for running a brothel.

816
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:58,797
How dare you use the word "brotheI".

817
00:57:58,881 --> 00:58:01,111
What word would you use?

818
00:58:07,481 --> 00:58:10,678
I was at work all hours. Esme was too.

819
00:58:12,041 --> 00:58:14,681
A neighbour told us men were calling there.

820
00:58:14,762 --> 00:58:18,960
I spoke to Harvey straight away,
but I had no proof.

821
00:58:19,042 --> 00:58:21,033
Then, suddenly the...

822
00:58:22,522 --> 00:58:24,035
...girl...

823
00:58:24,122 --> 00:58:25,760
seemed to have gone.

824
00:58:25,842 --> 00:58:26,911
Did you see her?

825
00:58:28,322 --> 00:58:29,516
Yes.

826
00:58:29,602 --> 00:58:32,070
Was it the girl whose remains we´ve found?

827
00:58:32,162 --> 00:58:34,358
Is that why you won´t co-operate?

828
00:58:35,443 --> 00:58:37,399
Listen.

829
00:58:38,723 --> 00:58:41,283
My family are very upset.

830
00:58:41,363 --> 00:58:43,399
It is an important time for us.

831
00:58:44,443 --> 00:58:47,321
A wedding should be a time of joy.

832
00:58:48,283 --> 00:58:52,914
I have cooperated with you in every way so far.

833
00:58:53,004 --> 00:58:54,722
Then please answer the question.

834
00:58:54,804 --> 00:58:57,637
Did she answer to the description
I´ve given you?

835
00:58:57,724 --> 00:59:00,113
No. She was a white girl.

836
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:03,116
- Not just light-skinned?
- No. White.

837
00:59:03,204 --> 00:59:05,434
Can you describe her, please?

838
00:59:07,164 --> 00:59:09,075
Small.

839
00:59:09,164 --> 00:59:11,120
Perhaps 5´2".

840
00:59:12,605 --> 00:59:14,561
A tiny thing, really.

841
00:59:14,645 --> 00:59:17,637
Blonde hair - bleached, I´d say.

842
00:59:19,005 --> 00:59:23,362
Young, but not the girl you described.

843
00:59:26,525 --> 00:59:28,402
Did you have sexual relations with her?

844
00:59:29,445 --> 00:59:31,402
I did not.

845
00:59:31,486 --> 00:59:34,842
And what was the relationship
between Harvey and this girl?

846
00:59:34,926 --> 00:59:36,564
God knows.

847
00:59:38,206 --> 00:59:40,925
I wouldn´t put anything past that man.

848
00:59:41,966 --> 00:59:44,560
And when did all this happen, Vernon?

849
00:59:47,006 --> 00:59:49,726
It could have been the summer
you´ve been talking about.

850
00:59:53,647 --> 00:59:56,719
The Viswandhas´ brief´s been bending my ear.

851
00:59:56,807 --> 01:00:01,437
He tells me Forensic are still poking around,
lifting up carpets, floorboards...

852
01:00:01,527 --> 01:00:02,880
So?

853
01:00:03,847 --> 01:00:07,157
Let´s get them out of there as soon as possible.

854
01:00:07,247 --> 01:00:09,204
Of course.

855
01:00:18,168 --> 01:00:20,124
Let´s see it, then.

856
01:00:27,328 --> 01:00:29,285
Very nice.

857
01:00:34,009 --> 01:00:38,321
Right, I want these photos to appear
everywhere in local and national press.

858
01:00:38,409 --> 01:00:43,688
Show them to anyone who might be able to
help. Let´s get the Allens in to see this.

859
01:00:45,329 --> 01:00:50,245
Vernon Allen confirmed there was a tom
working from the basement of No.15.

860
01:00:50,330 --> 01:00:56,246
His description doesn´t fit our "Nadine",
but maybe Nadine was a tom, as well.

861
01:00:56,330 --> 01:00:59,527
Perhaps Harvey was a small-time pimp.

862
01:00:59,610 --> 01:01:03,808
He´s in hospital all day tomorrow,
so I can´t tackle him till the evening.

863
01:01:05,410 --> 01:01:08,483
She doesn´t look like a prostitute.

864
01:01:09,531 --> 01:01:11,487
No.

865
01:01:14,691 --> 01:01:16,409
Well.

866
01:01:16,491 --> 01:01:18,447
Ask around, anyway.

867
01:01:29,732 --> 01:01:33,964
Vernon Allen has confirmed the whereabouts
of his family on 31 st August.

868
01:01:35,052 --> 01:01:39,364
You know there´s that reggae concert in
Honeyford Park on the last Sunday in August?

869
01:01:39,452 --> 01:01:41,727
Some of you made enough overtime out of it!

870
01:01:41,812 --> 01:01:48,332
Vernon Allen says Esme was there and is
every year. She runs a West Indian food stall.

871
01:01:48,413 --> 01:01:54,124
Tony Allen was also at the concert.
It´s an all-day affair: 10am to 10pm.

872
01:01:54,213 --> 01:01:58,331
Vernon stayed at home with Sarah and David.

873
01:01:58,413 --> 01:02:03,362
Tony returned home at about 9pm
so that Vernon could go to work.

874
01:02:03,453 --> 01:02:08,482
I´ve checked with Vernon´s work records
and he definitely did do a late shift that night,

875
01:02:08,574 --> 01:02:11,088
right through Sunday night
and late into Monday.

876
01:02:11,174 --> 01:02:15,452
<i>By the time Esme had packed up
and got home, it was about 10:45.</i>

877
01:02:15,534 --> 01:02:19,163
She says by the time she got home,
all the three kids were asleep in bed.

878
01:02:19,254 --> 01:02:23,612
Obviously, I´d like these accounts verified
wherever possible, OK?

879
01:02:23,695 --> 01:02:26,767
Perhaps that´s the link between
"Nadine" and Honeyford Road.

880
01:02:26,855 --> 01:02:29,653
- Sorry, what is?
- Reggae Sunsplash.

881
01:02:31,575 --> 01:02:33,486
Yeah, go on.

882
01:02:33,575 --> 01:02:36,772
Harvey could have met her there. Or Tony Allen.

883
01:02:36,855 --> 01:02:40,245
Perhaps the victim´s bag of African cloth
was a costume.

884
01:02:40,335 --> 01:02:43,169
She might even have been performing
at the concert.

885
01:02:43,256 --> 01:02:44,655
That´s a good point.

886
01:02:44,736 --> 01:02:48,649
Well, that´s an interesting thought.
Worth following up.

887
01:02:50,776 --> 01:02:56,089
Frank, Gary, go first thing tomorrow morning
to the Sunsplash organisers.

888
01:02:56,176 --> 01:02:58,895
See if they can point you towards any bands

889
01:02:58,976 --> 01:03:03,050
using musicians or backing singers
wearing African gear.

890
01:03:03,137 --> 01:03:06,686
- Right. Any more bright thoughts?
- Nope.

891
01:03:06,777 --> 01:03:09,450
No? All right, well, that´s it, then.

892
01:03:19,017 --> 01:03:20,973
Why are you doing this to me?

893
01:03:21,057 --> 01:03:22,571
What?

894
01:03:24,178 --> 01:03:26,328
Treating me like the office boy.

895
01:03:27,138 --> 01:03:29,094
I don´t know what you´re talking about.

896
01:03:29,178 --> 01:03:32,170
<i>Why didn´t you send me
to see the concert organisers?</i>

897
01:03:33,778 --> 01:03:39,171
You´re busy already. Besides, you didn´t want
special tasks because of your skin colour.

898
01:03:39,258 --> 01:03:43,411
I don´t. I want tasks commensurate
with my abilities and experience.

899
01:03:48,699 --> 01:03:51,008
Well, I want you to continue overseeing mispers.

900
01:03:51,099 --> 01:03:55,092
But I would also like you
to arrange for the Allens to see the clay head.

901
01:03:55,179 --> 01:03:57,170
Watch their reactions.

902
01:03:57,259 --> 01:03:59,011
Thank you.

903
01:04:26,981 --> 01:04:28,300
No.

904
01:04:29,341 --> 01:04:31,332
Are you sure, Vernon?

905
01:04:32,741 --> 01:04:34,697
Absolutely.

906
01:04:37,421 --> 01:04:38,741
Esme?

907
01:04:39,542 --> 01:04:43,501
No, dear. I´d remember if I had.

908
01:04:43,582 --> 01:04:45,652
What a beautiful child!

909
01:04:48,222 --> 01:04:50,782
Tony? What´s wrong?

910
01:04:52,142 --> 01:04:54,098
Come, Tony. Sit down.

911
01:05:04,303 --> 01:05:06,259
Calm down.

912
01:05:06,983 --> 01:05:08,860
Don´t fuss.

913
01:05:13,863 --> 01:05:15,819
It´s all right.

914
01:05:20,824 --> 01:05:24,976
It´s very hot in here. He suffers from asthma.

915
01:05:25,064 --> 01:05:30,058
I see. Have you seen her before, Tony?

916
01:05:32,784 --> 01:05:35,776
No. I´ve never seen her.

917
01:05:36,585 --> 01:05:38,337
You´re certain?

918
01:05:38,425 --> 01:05:40,177
I´m certain.

919
01:05:44,825 --> 01:05:47,897
Our prime suspect´s dying.
I won´t sit back and watch.

920
01:05:47,985 --> 01:05:51,455
I don´t know why you´re so bothered.
It´s just another dead prostitute.

921
01:05:51,545 --> 01:05:53,137
You don´t mean that.

922
01:05:53,225 --> 01:05:56,263
I do, if it means climbing these poxy stairs again!

923
01:05:56,346 --> 01:05:57,938
She´s someone´s daughter.

924
01:05:58,026 --> 01:05:59,539
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

925
01:05:59,626 --> 01:06:03,335
Anything we get from the old sod
is likely to be thrown out of court anyway.

926
01:06:03,426 --> 01:06:05,018
He didn´t know what he was saying...

927
01:06:22,427 --> 01:06:23,985
No.

928
01:06:25,307 --> 01:06:27,741
I´ve never seen her before.

929
01:06:30,387 --> 01:06:34,176
I did let out the basement room that summer.
I admit it.

930
01:06:34,268 --> 01:06:36,259
Nothing wrong with that.

931
01:06:36,348 --> 01:06:41,297
The big darky complained
about everything I did. He just wanted me out.

932
01:06:42,588 --> 01:06:46,467
So why did you let the room, David?
Did you know the girl already?

933
01:06:47,548 --> 01:06:50,301
No, I´ve never seen her before. Look...

934
01:06:52,308 --> 01:06:57,099
...it seemed a very big house just for me,
and I needed the money.

935
01:06:57,189 --> 01:06:59,100
So I put a card in the newsagent´s.

936
01:06:59,189 --> 01:07:00,258
What was her name?

937
01:07:01,509 --> 01:07:04,228
Tracy? Sharon? I don´t remember.

938
01:07:04,309 --> 01:07:07,028
- How long did she stay?
- Couple of months.

939
01:07:07,109 --> 01:07:09,020
- Which months?
- June, July.

940
01:07:09,109 --> 01:07:10,144
Not August?

941
01:07:11,749 --> 01:07:13,980
No, she´d gone by then.

942
01:07:14,070 --> 01:07:16,300
Did you know she was a prostitute?

943
01:07:16,390 --> 01:07:18,665
No.

944
01:07:18,750 --> 01:07:21,389
Could she have been friends with this girl?

945
01:07:21,470 --> 01:07:22,585
It´s possible.

946
01:07:22,670 --> 01:07:27,027
- Do you think she had a set of flat keys?
- It´s possible, I suppose.

947
01:07:27,870 --> 01:07:31,830
Could she and some friends have used the flat
that Sunday you were at your sister´s?

948
01:07:31,911 --> 01:07:34,061
How should I know?

949
01:07:34,151 --> 01:07:37,348
As you say... I wasn´t there.

950
01:07:40,431 --> 01:07:44,185
Your father remembers her.
Bleached blonde, slim, about 5´2".

951
01:07:44,271 --> 01:07:45,863
Well, I don´t!

952
01:07:46,911 --> 01:07:48,105
Do you like reggae, Tony?

953
01:07:48,191 --> 01:07:49,909
What?

954
01:07:49,991 --> 01:07:53,462
I do. Reggae, soul, jazz. Do you like jazz?

955
01:07:53,552 --> 01:07:57,067
- What are you on about? Just leave me alone.
- Don´t jump the rails.

956
01:07:57,152 --> 01:07:59,507
I don´t remember any girl!

957
01:08:09,993 --> 01:08:11,949
There you go, mate.

958
01:08:17,673 --> 01:08:22,588
One last thing, David.
Could we have a photograph of you, please?

959
01:08:22,673 --> 01:08:23,628
Why?

960
01:08:23,713 --> 01:08:26,307
It´ll help to eliminate you from our inquiries.

961
01:08:26,393 --> 01:08:29,386
- Will I get it back?
- Yes, of course.

962
01:08:29,474 --> 01:08:32,113
One from the mid-´80s, if that´s possible.

963
01:08:33,474 --> 01:08:35,032
Are you the photographer?

964
01:08:35,114 --> 01:08:37,025
No, my nephew Jason.

965
01:08:37,114 --> 01:08:39,070
Mmm. Very good.

966
01:08:39,834 --> 01:08:41,552
Here.

967
01:08:41,634 --> 01:08:44,068
Younger and fitter there, eh?

968
01:08:44,154 --> 01:08:48,227
Thank you. I´ll get it copied and have it sent
back to you as soon as possible.

969
01:08:59,995 --> 01:09:03,032
I´d remove that, David. That´s not very safe.

970
01:09:03,115 --> 01:09:05,185
So somebody can get in if I collapse.

971
01:09:05,275 --> 01:09:07,152
All the same. Thank you.

972
01:09:07,235 --> 01:09:09,192
Thanks a lot.

973
01:09:09,916 --> 01:09:12,589
You´d make a wonderful
Crime Prevention Officer.

974
01:09:15,196 --> 01:09:17,346
Night, guv. I hope you get something.

975
01:09:17,436 --> 01:09:19,791
Thanks. See you tomorrow.

976
01:10:01,758 --> 01:10:04,431
I wouldn´t if I were you, dear.

977
01:10:09,839 --> 01:10:10,954
Hello.

978
01:10:11,039 --> 01:10:14,236
Hi, Rachel. Fancy something to eat?

979
01:10:19,159 --> 01:10:21,719
Well, if he´s a pimp, I´ve never seen him before.

980
01:10:23,799 --> 01:10:25,392
I´ll ask around about the blonde,

981
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:28,040
- but it´s not much to go on.
- You´re telling me!

982
01:10:28,120 --> 01:10:32,238
Maybe she was one of those that tried it for five
minutes and decided it was no kind of life.

983
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,752
One of the sensible ones.

984
01:10:36,520 --> 01:10:41,116
Still, I suppose someone might remember,
cos most of the giris who do that area are black.

985
01:10:42,800 --> 01:10:44,917
This is a likeness of the dead girl.

986
01:10:48,241 --> 01:10:50,197
Spooky!

987
01:10:51,361 --> 01:10:53,033
No.

988
01:10:53,121 --> 01:10:54,839
Never seen her before either.

989
01:10:58,121 --> 01:11:00,077
OK.

990
01:11:03,602 --> 01:11:05,558
Do your best, OK?

991
01:11:06,442 --> 01:11:08,160
I always do.

992
01:11:08,242 --> 01:11:10,358
See you around. Thanks.

993

We´re under the microscope.

Do you want to look at them, sir,
before you answer?

1014
01:12:56,327 --> 01:13:00,162
- I don´t know her!
- Right, mate? DC Rosper, Southampton Row.

1015
01:13:00,248 --> 01:13:02,523
Look at the photograph before you answer!

1016
01:13:02,608 --> 01:13:06,647
- You can´t make a man look at a photograph.
- Can´t I?

1017
01:13:06,728 --> 01:13:09,083
I can nick him for obstructing police inquiries.

1018
01:13:09,168 --> 01:13:10,806
He wasn´t even with the band then!

1019
01:13:10,888 --> 01:13:12,765
Can I have a word, Frank?

1020
01:13:12,848 --> 01:13:13,997
Let me take a look.

1021
01:13:14,088 --> 01:13:15,806
Guv?

1022
01:13:15,888 --> 01:13:18,767
Your battyman want a word with you, Frank.

1023
01:13:18,849 --> 01:13:20,805
Freedom...

1024
01:13:25,889 --> 01:13:27,242
What did he call me?

1025
01:13:27,329 --> 01:13:28,284
I don´t know.

1026
01:13:28,369 --> 01:13:30,485
You do. I´m gonna nick him.

1027
01:13:30,569 --> 01:13:32,287
That´ll be a big help!

1028
01:13:32,369 --> 01:13:34,325
Perhaps the guv gave you this lead

1029
01:13:34,409 --> 01:13:37,402
to see if you can talk to a black guy
without arresting him.

1030
01:13:37,490 --> 01:13:41,085
That drummer might know something.
I´m going back.

1031
01:13:41,170 --> 01:13:43,126
Go on, but you´re wasting your time.

1032
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:47,045
Guv?

1033
01:13:47,130 --> 01:13:48,882
Thought you´d like to know,

1034
01:13:48,970 --> 01:13:53,919
Forensics found a fragment of our girI´s tooth
between the floorboards of No.15.

1035
01:13:54,010 --> 01:13:57,686
- Yes!
- I think I might have found her.

1036
01:13:57,771 --> 01:14:01,525
Joanne Fagunwa. Mixed parentage,
went missing in ´85 from Birmingham.

1037
01:14:01,611 --> 01:14:04,489
- Got a photograph?
- With the file, that´s in Birmingham.

1038
01:14:04,571 --> 01:14:08,280
- Get it faxed. If it looks promising, then go.
- To Birmingham?

1039
01:14:08,371 --> 01:14:10,521
Did we check on when Mrs Harvey died?

1040
01:14:10,611 --> 01:14:13,364
- August ´85, wasn´t it?
- Boss, can we go?

1041
01:14:13,451 --> 01:14:15,328
Yeah, come on, let´s go.

1042
01:14:15,412 --> 01:14:17,368
Nice one, Bob.

1043
01:14:18,492 --> 01:14:20,448
- Later.
- Yeah, man, later.

1044
01:14:21,732 --> 01:14:22,767
Where´s Dirty Harry?

1045
01:14:22,852 --> 01:14:23,967
Eh?

1046
01:14:24,052 --> 01:14:25,770
- Your partner.
- Clint Eastwood.

1047
01:14:25,852 --> 01:14:27,683
Oh, yeah, sorry about that, man.

1048
01:14:27,772 --> 01:14:30,081
- Do you like reggae?
- Yeah - solid, guy.

1049
01:14:30,172 --> 01:14:32,128
Seen!

1050
01:14:38,373 --> 01:14:40,329
Cheers.

1051
01:14:41,533 --> 01:14:44,206
Peruse these at your leisure.

1052
01:14:44,293 --> 01:14:45,612
Wicked!

1053
01:14:49,213 --> 01:14:50,362
Cheers!

1054
01:15:02,454 --> 01:15:06,242
Vids from ´86. Apparently
two bands used girl backing singers.

1055
01:15:06,334 --> 01:15:09,406
Do I have what it takes,
or do I have what it takes?

1056
01:15:11,254 --> 01:15:17,364
<i>I´m not saying you killed her, David, but what I
am saying is that she was killed in your house.</i>

1057
01:15:24,895 --> 01:15:26,453
Are you all right, sir?

1058
01:15:26,535 --> 01:15:29,413
Shit. Call an ambulance, Tony.

1059
01:15:33,056 --> 01:15:35,172
Don´t move. Don´t move.

1060
01:15:36,896 --> 01:15:40,332
- Hello? Can I have an ambulance?
- Quick!

1061
01:15:40,416 --> 01:15:46,855
Jonesy, we´re going to the hospital,
so you can contact us there. All right.

1062
01:15:48,496 --> 01:15:50,771
We could lose this one, if Harvey croaks.

1063
01:15:50,856 --> 01:15:52,813
Right, come on.

1064
01:17:01,180 --> 01:17:03,136
Can I show you these photographs?

1065
01:17:03,220 --> 01:17:04,369
Yes.

1066
01:17:14,181 --> 01:17:17,651
Do you recognise these amulets, Mrs Fagunwa?

1067
01:17:17,741 --> 01:17:21,734
Yes. They belonged to my husband´s family.

1068
01:17:22,981 --> 01:17:24,778
He gave them to Joanne.

1069
01:17:29,262 --> 01:17:33,892
Then I´m sorry to tell you that they were found
with the remains of a young girl.

1070
01:17:34,982 --> 01:17:38,418
Can I show you a photograph
of a clay head we´ve had made?

1071
01:17:39,982 --> 01:17:41,131
Yes.

1072
01:17:54,503 --> 01:17:56,619
Does that look like your daughter?

1073
01:17:56,703 --> 01:17:58,295
Oh, yes.

1074
01:17:59,823 --> 01:18:01,779
It´s very like her.

1075
01:18:04,183 --> 01:18:05,696
It´s very clever.

1076
01:18:05,783 --> 01:18:07,536
I´m sorry.

1077
01:18:10,944 --> 01:18:13,060
How did she die?

1078
01:18:15,104 --> 01:18:19,495
Well, we´re not certain,
but the circumstances are suspicious.

1079
01:18:22,064 --> 01:18:23,975
Don´t tell me she suffered.

1080
01:18:25,064 --> 01:18:27,260
Please, please, don´t tell me that.

1081
01:18:28,665 --> 01:18:30,496
Reggae

1082
01:18:37,065 --> 01:18:38,623
How´s it going, Gary?

1083
01:18:38,705 --> 01:18:40,661
I´m having a skanking good time, skip!

1084
01:18:40,745 --> 01:18:42,701
Are you, indeed?

1085
01:18:49,546 --> 01:18:50,865
<i>Are you feeling all right?</i>

1086
01:18:51,306 --> 01:18:53,900
Her father died that year, you see.

1087
01:18:53,986 --> 01:18:56,500
I still don´t know why she left home.

1088
01:18:56,586 --> 01:18:58,383
She had everything.

1089
01:18:59,466 --> 01:19:02,538
She even had her own pony.
She had everything.

1090
01:19:04,067 --> 01:19:06,297
Did Joanne ever have any accidents as a child?

1091
01:19:06,387 --> 01:19:09,697
No. Well, you know, the usual cuts and bruises...

1092
01:19:09,787 --> 01:19:13,541
Oh, yes, she did. She broke her wrist.
She fell off her bike.

1093
01:19:19,667 --> 01:19:22,977
Anyway, she rejected it all.

1094
01:19:23,067 --> 01:19:27,107
She started having bits woven in her hair.
You know, beads.

1095
01:19:27,188 --> 01:19:32,057
Her hair isn´t even black, really,
it´s more a dark brown with gold threads.

1096
01:19:32,148 --> 01:19:34,423
She was almost blonde when she was little.

1097
01:19:34,508 --> 01:19:37,659
And her skin looks almost tanned,
more than anything else.

1098
01:19:38,748 --> 01:19:40,898
She was such a pretty little girl.

1099
01:19:41,988 --> 01:19:44,139
We´ve got so many photographs.

1100
01:19:44,229 --> 01:19:46,982
I keep meaning to sort them out.

1101
01:19:49,269 --> 01:19:53,148
I don´t think the local police treated
her disappearance seriously.

1102
01:19:53,229 --> 01:19:58,462
Just another young girl leaving home,
going to London. Loads of them do, don´t they?

1103
01:19:58,549 --> 01:20:02,304
I saw a documentary. It isn´t just Joanne.

1104
01:20:08,390 --> 01:20:10,346
Reggae

1105
01:20:19,950 --> 01:20:21,907
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1106
01:20:26,191 --> 01:20:28,261
She always thought the best of people.

1107
01:20:30,551 --> 01:20:33,270
Perhaps we protected her too much.

1108
01:20:36,711 --> 01:20:38,667
I don´t know.

1109
01:20:39,551 --> 01:20:41,224
Have you got children?

1110
01:20:42,032 --> 01:20:43,750
No, no.

1111
01:20:43,832 --> 01:20:45,584
Would you like a cup of coffee?

1112
01:20:45,672 --> 01:20:47,663
That would be lovely.

1113
01:20:49,752 --> 01:20:53,825
Perhaps if ours hadn´t been a mixed marriage...

1114
01:20:54,592 --> 01:20:57,026
Do you think that could have been the problem?

1115
01:20:58,072 --> 01:21:00,303
Made her go off like that?

1116
01:21:05,993 --> 01:21:10,544
That´s right. And Bob Oswalde called in.
He´s got a positive ID.

1117
01:21:10,633 --> 01:21:13,466
Joanne Fagunwa. He´s bringing Mum in now.

1118
01:21:13,553 --> 01:21:14,827
Brilliant.

1119
01:21:14,913 --> 01:21:16,869
Turn it down, please!

1120
01:21:16,953 --> 01:21:18,865
He didn´t look that bad.

1121
01:21:18,954 --> 01:21:21,388
He´s a very ill man, you´ve seen yourself.

1122
01:21:21,474 --> 01:21:26,628
He has great difficulty breathing, even lying flat.
He needs complete rest.

1123
01:21:26,714 --> 01:21:34,029
Dr Lim, we have reason to believe he was
involved in the murder of a 17-year-old girl.

1124
01:21:34,114 --> 01:21:37,869
I don´t mind what conditions you make,
but we have to talk to the man.

1125
01:22:14,796 --> 01:22:16,753
This I recognise.

1126
01:22:18,477 --> 01:22:22,106
It´s my one and only attempt at knitting.

1127
01:22:38,878 --> 01:22:40,834
Why her?

1128
01:22:45,878 --> 01:22:47,834
Why her?

1129
01:23:00,519 --> 01:23:02,953
Thank you for your kindness.

1130
01:23:03,039 --> 01:23:08,750
Do you think you´ll find out how it happened?
You know, find the person who did it?

1131
01:23:08,839 --> 01:23:10,795
I´m sure we will.

1132
01:23:14,880 --> 01:23:16,836
I wonder...

1133
01:23:18,280 --> 01:23:20,236
This may seem...

1134
01:23:22,320 --> 01:23:25,471
Could I buy the clay head
when your inquiries are over?

1135
01:23:27,200 --> 01:23:28,792
It´s just that...

1136
01:23:29,560 --> 01:23:31,437
Does that seem strange?

1137
01:23:31,520 --> 01:23:34,081
No, no. I´ll find out for you.

1138
01:23:35,281 --> 01:23:37,237
There´s nothing else, is there?

1139
01:23:40,521 --> 01:23:44,070
There´s nothing to remind me of my baby.

1140
01:23:53,762 --> 01:23:55,718
OK. Take care.

1141
01:24:24,683 --> 01:24:27,277
Did the Allens have keys to Harvey´s house?

1142
01:24:28,403 --> 01:24:30,633
I suppose they must have.

1143
01:24:33,164 --> 01:24:35,120
Where did Tony Allen go to school?

1144
01:24:40,604 --> 01:24:42,481
Have you seen this, Bob?

1145
01:24:42,564 --> 01:24:43,883
Is that the tape of Joanne?

1146
01:24:43,964 --> 01:24:46,239
You should have a look. I think I´m in love.

1147
01:24:54,045 --> 01:24:56,639
I was his head of year.
I remember him very well.

1148
01:24:56,725 --> 01:25:00,001
Bright lad. Did very well in the fifth form.

1149
01:25:00,085 --> 01:25:04,397
Good results, going on to A level,
sights set on a college place.

1150
01:25:04,485 --> 01:25:10,322
But when he came back in September, he´d
changed. He was surly and introverted. A loner.

1151
01:25:16,606 --> 01:25:19,439
- Let me know as soon as he wakes up.
- I will.

1152
01:25:19,526 --> 01:25:26,045
I spoke to him, the headmistress spoke to him,
I got Dad up. Nothing seemed to help.

1153
01:25:26,126 --> 01:25:29,483
Ah, there we are. September ´86.

1154
01:25:29,567 --> 01:25:33,924
I´m usually right.
Educational psychologist´s report. Help yourself.

1155
01:25:37,527 --> 01:25:39,040
I see Tony played in a band.

1156
01:25:39,127 --> 01:25:41,436
Did he? I didn´t know that.

1157
01:25:41,527 --> 01:25:46,043
We did our best,
but there was really no point in him staying.

1158
01:25:46,127 --> 01:25:50,724
The only person he related to was his Sarah.
He´d gone by Christmas.

1159
01:25:51,568 --> 01:25:56,323
I still see him in the supermarket from time
to time. Waste, really. Bright lad.

1160
01:26:11,449 --> 01:26:12,518
Hello?

1161
01:26:12,609 --> 01:26:14,565
<i>Jane?</i>

1162
01:26:15,929 --> 01:26:17,282
Who´s this?

1163
01:26:17,369 --> 01:26:19,121
<i>It´s Bob Oswalde</i>

1164
01:26:19,809 --> 01:26:23,518
<i>Jane Look I know this is a bit uexpected</i>

1165
01:26:23,609 --> 01:26:26,169
<i>but I want to talk to you</i>

1166
01:26:27,610 --> 01:26:31,398
Can´t it wait?
I´m expecting a call from the hospital.

1167
01:26:31,490 --> 01:26:33,446
<i>No</i>

1168
01:26:35,490 --> 01:26:37,446
All right.

1169
01:26:56,571 --> 01:26:58,687
This had better be good.

1170
01:27:07,372 --> 01:27:09,328
I´ve seen this.

1171
01:27:12,292 --> 01:27:13,407
There.

1172
01:27:13,492 --> 01:27:16,529
Your finger, very interesting.

1173
01:27:16,612 --> 01:27:18,568
There´s a better shot in a moment.

1174
01:27:21,412 --> 01:27:22,481
There.

1175
01:27:25,053 --> 01:27:27,009
Is that Tony Allen?

1176
01:27:27,093 --> 01:27:28,321
Tony Allen.

1177
01:27:28,413 --> 01:27:29,687
Jesus!

1178
01:27:29,773 --> 01:27:33,129
He concealed the fact he played
at Sunsplash and evidently knew Joanne.

1179
01:27:33,213 --> 01:27:36,171
The Allens had keys to Harvey´s house.
I´ve been to his school.

1180
01:27:36,253 --> 01:27:38,289
Wait, wait, wait. Let´s think this through.

1181
01:27:38,373 --> 01:27:40,682
Just cos he´s on the same bandstand
as Joanne...

1182
01:27:40,773 --> 01:27:43,493
Oh, shit!

1183
01:27:43,574 --> 01:27:46,930
This could be it.
I´m expecting Harvey to come round.

1184
01:27:49,174 --> 01:27:50,289
What´s this?

1185
01:27:50,374 --> 01:27:55,892
Last night´s dinner.
One of those frozen chilli con carne things.

1186
01:27:55,974 --> 01:27:58,488
What have you got for tonight?

1187
01:27:58,574 --> 01:28:00,724
One of those frozen chilli con carne things.

1188
01:28:04,695 --> 01:28:06,765
DCI Tennison.

1189
01:28:08,375 --> 01:28:10,730
<i>Where do you think you´re going?</i>

1190
01:28:10,815 --> 01:28:15,764
Oh, right. Good. She got a number?
It´s a call box, is it?

1191
01:28:16,615 --> 01:28:19,175
Two, three. Got it.

1192
01:28:19,255 --> 01:28:22,214
Tell her I´ll call her straight away. Thanks.

1193
01:28:22,296 --> 01:28:25,971
It´s not the hospital. It´s a snout of mine
trying to get through to me.

1194
01:28:26,056 --> 01:28:27,091
Right.

1195
01:28:28,416 --> 01:28:30,134
What are you up to?

1196
01:28:30,216 --> 01:28:34,289
Rachel. It´s me. What you got for me, darling?

1197
01:28:35,696 --> 01:28:37,812
Bye.

1198
01:28:40,216 --> 01:28:43,653
- What the hell do you think you´re doing?
- What´s this?

1199
01:28:44,857 --> 01:28:48,930
It´s lettuce. Well, it was, once.

1200
01:28:49,017 --> 01:28:52,453
You really need to eat some decent food.
What was the telephone call?

1201
01:28:52,537 --> 01:28:55,734
- Anything interesting?
- No, not really.

1202
01:28:55,817 --> 01:28:59,173
The girl who was at No.15 jacked it in soon after,
went legit.

1203
01:28:59,257 --> 01:29:02,534
No-one knows where she is,
but they´re sure she´s not on the game.

1204
01:29:02,618 --> 01:29:05,052
I took a look at Tony Allen´s school records.

1205
01:29:06,298 --> 01:29:08,766
Now, everything was fine until 1986.

1206
01:29:08,858 --> 01:29:11,213
He came back from summer holiday
a different person.

1207
01:29:11,298 --> 01:29:15,576
The psychologist´s report talks of anxiety,
depressión, low self-esteem...

1208
01:29:15,658 --> 01:29:17,376
What is it with you?

1209
01:29:17,458 --> 01:29:20,531
- What?
- What are you trying to prove?

1210
01:29:20,619 --> 01:29:22,177
Do you have any tomato puree?

1211
01:29:22,259 --> 01:29:23,738
No.

1212
01:29:23,819 --> 01:29:27,573
- How can I work in these conditions?
- It´s as if you´re trying to take a test.

1213
01:29:27,659 --> 01:29:30,253
You´re no different.
I watched you on the course.

1214
01:29:30,339 --> 01:29:33,376
You know they´re lined up wanting to see you
fall flat on your face.

1215
01:29:33,459 --> 01:29:35,415
Thorndike and the rest of the senior shits.

1216
01:29:35,499 --> 01:29:39,778
So you want to be the best, come out on top.
Well, I´m the same as you.

1217
01:29:39,860 --> 01:29:42,977
Which is why,
when I calmed down and thought about it,

1218
01:29:43,060 --> 01:29:45,699
I understood
why you´d treated me like the office boy.

1219
01:29:45,780 --> 01:29:50,171
And why you´ve gone off on your own?
Bob, you are a member of a team.

1220
01:29:50,260 --> 01:29:51,534
Am I?

1221
01:29:53,220 --> 01:29:55,211
Well, from now on you are.

1222
01:29:55,300 --> 01:29:59,055
OK. I don´t suppose
you´ve got anything to drink?

1223
01:29:59,141 --> 01:30:00,972
- So let´s pick him up!
- No. Not yet.

1224
01:30:02,301 --> 01:30:04,371
I know that boy´s involved in the murder.

1225
01:30:04,461 --> 01:30:06,179
You have no evidence.

1226
01:30:06,261 --> 01:30:09,890
- I saw him with the clay head.
- They were just on the same bandstand.

1227
01:30:09,981 --> 01:30:11,573
So he lied.

1228
01:30:11,661 --> 01:30:14,733
We´ll tackle him when the right time comes.

1229
01:30:14,821 --> 01:30:17,620
- What does that mean?
- It means, not yet!

1230
01:30:17,702 --> 01:30:20,136
I can crack Harvey. I´m sure he holds the key.

1231
01:30:20,222 --> 01:30:22,895
Except the bastard might croak on us
at any time.

1232
01:30:22,982 --> 01:30:25,860
- I thought you´d go for this.
- I don´t want to argue about it!

1233
01:30:25,942 --> 01:30:28,661
Obviously, the point is,
I shouldn´t have come here.

1234
01:30:28,742 --> 01:30:32,735
Well, no, you shouldn´t.
We said that at the hotel.

1235
01:30:33,382 --> 01:30:36,215
That´s not the point. All I´m trying to say...

1236
01:30:36,302 --> 01:30:38,419
Look, don´t bother.

1237
01:30:43,103 --> 01:30:46,539
- Oh, hello, guv.
- It went very well, since you ask.

1238
01:30:46,623 --> 01:30:47,738
Sorry, what?

1239
01:30:47,823 --> 01:30:50,291
- My interview.
- Oh, yeah, right. Good.

1240
01:30:50,383 --> 01:30:52,101
Any news on Harvey?

1241
01:30:52,183 --> 01:30:55,141
He´s regained consciousness.
I´m going to see him.

1242
01:30:55,223 --> 01:30:57,579
Gently does it, Jane.

1243
01:30:57,664 --> 01:31:01,134
Get him anything he wants -
solicitors, geisha giris, anything -

1244
01:31:01,224 --> 01:31:05,103
so his brief can´t suggest
you got his statement unfairly.

1245
01:31:05,184 --> 01:31:10,133
<i>Guv, apparently Harvey´s wife died
in October ´85, not August.</i>

1246
01:31:10,224 --> 01:31:12,977
- So his sister´s been telling fibs.
- So it would seem.

1247
01:31:14,024 --> 01:31:16,585
Let´s see what Harvey´s got to say about that.

1248
01:31:16,665 --> 01:31:19,896
- By-election today.
- Why are you not in your blue rosette?

1249
01:31:19,985 --> 01:31:23,864
Senior policemen are politicians
first and foremost, Jane.

1250
01:31:23,945 --> 01:31:26,413
Remember that, if you´re up for super.

1251
01:31:28,545 --> 01:31:32,060
- Are we in?
- Dr Lim is a bit jumpy, but, yeah, I think so.

1252
01:31:32,145 --> 01:31:33,863
Good.

1253
01:31:33,945 --> 01:31:37,939
I don´t want him upset. Any extra
pressure on his heart could be fatal.

1254
01:31:43,226 --> 01:31:45,182
Hello, Tony.

1255
01:31:46,666 --> 01:31:51,421
You don´t remember me?
Detective Sergeant Oswalde.

1256
01:31:53,507 --> 01:31:58,501
I´m doing a bit of shopping, and while I´m here,
perhaps you could look at this.

1257
01:31:59,507 --> 01:32:02,624
Do you recognise her? It´s Joanne.

1258
01:32:03,427 --> 01:32:06,385
Why don´t you people just leave me alone?

1259
01:32:06,467 --> 01:32:09,698
Because you´re telling us lies.
You knew Joanne.

1260
01:32:09,787 --> 01:32:11,505
No!

1261
01:32:11,587 --> 01:32:14,341
You were at Sunsplash together.

1262
01:32:14,428 --> 01:32:18,546
Better than that, you played in the same band.

1263
01:32:21,028 --> 01:32:25,226
Remember her African costume, Tony?
Her bracelets?

1264
01:32:28,308 --> 01:32:30,822
I don´t know what you´re talking about.

1265
01:32:30,908 --> 01:32:32,627
Oh, yes, you do.

1266
01:32:32,709 --> 01:32:34,665
I don´t.

1267
01:32:48,189 --> 01:32:52,786
Don´t you think it´d be a good idea
to talk to me, David?

1268
01:32:52,870 --> 01:32:54,826
Get it off your chest?

1269
01:32:56,190 --> 01:32:58,146
Why?

1270
01:33:00,310 --> 01:33:06,624
David, we know that Joanne -
that was her name -

1271
01:33:06,710 --> 01:33:09,986
we know that Joanne
was killed inside your home.

1272
01:33:11,751 --> 01:33:15,141
A fragment of her tooth was found in the house.

1273
01:33:17,391 --> 01:33:19,746
Doesn´t mean I killed her.

1274
01:33:25,631 --> 01:33:29,180
Your wife didn´t die in August, did she, David?

1275
01:33:29,912 --> 01:33:33,268
<i>Jeanie died in October 1985.</i>

1276
01:33:36,352 --> 01:33:40,789
What´s the point in lying, David?
Carrying all that guilt?

1277
01:33:41,472 --> 01:33:43,508
You know you´re a very ill man.

1278
01:33:44,992 --> 01:33:49,225
If you do tell me, nothing will happen to you.

1279
01:33:49,313 --> 01:33:51,747
It´ll never come to trial.

1280
01:33:53,833 --> 01:33:56,791
We´ll just be able to clear this whole thing up.

1281
01:33:58,113 --> 01:34:01,344
And most important of all,
you´ll feel so much better.

1282
01:34:04,673 --> 01:34:07,141
Yo, Tony!

1283
01:34:07,233 --> 01:34:09,190
All right?

1284
01:34:12,074 --> 01:34:15,544
What is wrong with you?
Why are you doing this to me?

1285
01:34:15,634 --> 01:34:18,273
Doing what, man? I´ve been shopping.

1286
01:34:18,354 --> 01:34:20,310
Leave me alone!

1287
01:34:21,074 --> 01:34:23,030
Just leave me alone!

1288
01:34:29,195 --> 01:34:32,392
You know, I´m a Catholic too, David.

1289
01:34:34,355 --> 01:34:37,108
It´s been a long time since my last confessión.

1290
01:34:38,395 --> 01:34:43,594
But the one thing I do remember
is that feeling of relief, you know?

1291
01:34:44,635 --> 01:34:47,389
A great weight being lifted off your shoulders.

1292
01:34:50,596 --> 01:34:53,235
I think we all want to believe in something,
don´t we?

1293
01:34:54,316 --> 01:34:58,275
We´d like to think we could just repent,
everything would be all right.

1294
01:35:01,956 --> 01:35:07,031
If only we could just turn the clock back
and make everything all right.

1295
01:35:11,437 --> 01:35:13,393
You´re dying, David.

1296
01:35:14,997 --> 01:35:19,787
Why don´t you just get it off your chest?
Just tell me what happened.

1297
01:35:23,157 --> 01:35:26,070
No more lies. It´s too late for lies.

1298
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:31,232
Come on, you can talk to me.

1299
01:35:33,720 --> 01:35:35,438
Can I?

1300
01:35:35,520 --> 01:35:39,653
Of course. You can have your doctor
present, a solicitor, Jason,

1301
01:35:39,656 --> 01:35:41,658
your sister, anyone.

1302
01:35:45,519 --> 01:35:48,272
You know, I´m only 55 years old.

1303
01:35:50,880 --> 01:35:52,836
It´s a joke.

1304
01:35:55,240 --> 01:35:57,276
I´m sure the doctors will do all they can.

1305
01:36:02,800 --> 01:36:04,756
I´m very frightened.

1306
01:36:08,840 --> 01:36:10,796
Leave me alone!

1307
01:36:13,080 --> 01:36:15,036
Leave me alone!
