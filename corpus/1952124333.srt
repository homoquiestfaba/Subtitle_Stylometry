1
00:01:01,084 --> 00:01:03,737
Dad...
What's happening?

2
00:01:04,408 --> 00:01:05,280
I need you to listen to me.

3
00:01:05,281 --> 00:01:07,923
Like where the last people on the planet.
Okay Nick?

4
00:01:08,813 --> 00:01:12,838
Someday a girl
is gonna give you a flower...

5
00:01:13,118 --> 00:01:16,286
You have to get that flower...
and you have to help her Nick.

6
00:01:16,287 --> 00:01:18,287
You help her and you help us all.

7
00:01:21,959 --> 00:01:23,971
I know this doesn't
makes any sense right now...

8
00:01:24,212 --> 00:01:26,835
But I believe the woman
who told me that...

9
00:01:27,125 --> 00:01:30,149
You think you could believe me?

10
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:33,503
I love you.

11
00:01:37,107 --> 00:01:42,404
Now they said you are special, Nick.
Turns out I was right.

12
00:01:49,943 --> 00:01:52,275
The Division is here Nick.
Just keep moving...

13
00:01:52,496 --> 00:01:55,820
and don't make any decision
that any watcher can track.

14
00:02:35,805 --> 00:02:37,255
Move!

15
00:02:37,256 --> 00:02:38,907
Everybody move out!

16
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:40,908
This one is a highly
compensation.

17
00:02:40,909 --> 00:02:43,909
Out the way! Out the way!

18
00:03:03,461 --> 00:03:04,587
What a waste.

19
00:03:06,588 --> 00:03:08,588
Take his body to the lab.

20
00:03:14,374 --> 00:03:17,067
There are special people in this world.

21
00:03:17,298 --> 00:03:21,422
We don't ask to be special...
were just born this way.

22
00:03:25,898 --> 00:03:28,065
We past you on the streets every day.

23
00:03:29,066 --> 00:03:31,066
And noticed by most.

24
00:03:40,696 --> 00:03:42,766
It started in 1945...

25
00:03:42,800 --> 00:03:46,500
The Nazis were conducting
an experiment in psychic warfare.

26
00:03:47,264 --> 00:03:51,248
Trying to turn those
with psychic abilities into soldiers.

27
00:03:52,849 --> 00:03:54,249
Lots of us died.

28
00:03:54,250 --> 00:03:58,427
The war ended but the experiments
never stopped.

29
00:03:58,657 --> 00:04:00,672
Other governments around the world...

30
00:04:00,673 --> 00:04:01,673
setup what they called "Divisions"

31
00:04:06,497 --> 00:04:08,121
Trying to do what the Nazis couldn't

32
00:04:08,122 --> 00:04:09,122
To turn us into weapons.

33
00:04:10,331 --> 00:04:11,795
The Division's agent are trained

34
00:04:11,796 --> 00:04:14,100
to track and hunt us down
like animals.

35
00:04:14,196 --> 00:04:16,489
Take us away
from our families and friends.

36
00:04:21,024 --> 00:04:23,079
They test us and
categorize us.

37
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,080
I'm they called a "Watcher".

38
00:04:25,329 --> 00:04:26,623
We can see the future...

39
00:04:26,624 --> 00:04:29,170
even if it's not always as simple
as it's sounds.

40
00:04:32,648 --> 00:04:34,653
Others are called "Movers"

41
00:04:34,654 --> 00:04:37,654
Just an easy way of saying telekinetic.

42
00:04:41,809 --> 00:04:44,005
Pushers put thoughts on your head...

43
00:04:44,006 --> 00:04:46,436
and make whatever lie they come-up
with the truth.

44
00:04:54,254 --> 00:04:57,780
Sniffs, shifters, shadows, bleeders...

45
00:04:57,781 --> 00:04:59,781
It goes on and on.

46
00:05:00,211 --> 00:05:03,695
And in Division's eyes,
we're all just lab rats.

47
00:05:03,926 --> 00:05:05,411
Only one problem...

48
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:07,600
we keep dying.

49
00:05:11,415 --> 00:05:15,139
No one has ever survived the drug
meant to boost our powers.

50
00:05:15,379 --> 00:05:17,202
My name is Cassie Holmes.

51
00:05:17,432 --> 00:05:19,049
Division took my mom from me.

52
00:05:19,050 --> 00:05:20,050
Right now...

53
00:05:20,051 --> 00:05:22,051
The future I see
doesn't look so great.

54
00:05:22,057 --> 00:05:25,251
The good news is
the future is always changing.

55
00:05:25,451 --> 00:05:29,847
In the largest of ways...
by the smallest of things.

56
00:05:30,157 --> 00:05:32,144
They've been winning a lot of battles.

57
00:05:32,145 --> 00:05:34,845
Now it's our turn to win the war.

58
00:07:13,281 --> 00:07:15,864
She survived the injection.

59
00:07:16,284 --> 00:07:19,548
She's our patient "Zero".
Bring me every sniffer we have.

60
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,123
She's on foot.
She can't get far.

61
00:07:23,703 --> 00:07:26,417
She'll get help from anyone
she can lay her eyes on.

62
00:07:29,691 --> 00:07:32,791
Do whatever is necessary to get her
and that syringe back.

63
00:07:32,792 --> 00:07:33,792
Now!

64
00:09:32,308 --> 00:09:34,731
You want to bet or not?

65
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:59,100
What you say there Nick?

66
00:10:59,805 --> 00:11:00,805
Who are you?

67
00:11:01,064 --> 00:11:02,486
We're with the Division.
- Like you didn't know?

68
00:11:04,148 --> 00:11:05,272
Go to hell.
- Easy son.

69
00:11:05,273 --> 00:11:07,511
We warn you.
You'll be at the back of the van.

70
00:11:07,512 --> 00:11:09,695
You gonna bet us in or
we gonna have to be rude?

71
00:11:13,509 --> 00:11:15,962
Who's movin’ to
a shit hole like this?

72
00:11:16,172 --> 00:11:17,387
One on top of the other.

73
00:11:17,388 --> 00:11:19,022
Took you far off the radar.

74
00:11:19,023 --> 00:11:20,400
How far enough?

75
00:11:23,982 --> 00:11:25,734
Can you believe
this is how we found you?

76
00:11:25,914 --> 00:11:28,578
From your old toothbrush,
from our encounter 10 years ago.

77
00:11:28,579 --> 00:11:29,922
Barely I said luck.

78
00:11:34,695 --> 00:11:36,702
Thought you were in Tokyo...

79
00:11:39,100 --> 00:11:40,100
and Malaysia.

80
00:11:49,442 --> 00:11:50,668
Finally we got a...

81
00:11:50,669 --> 00:11:53,100
your reading from some buildings.

82
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,142
So lot of runaway psychics
in Hong Kong.

83
00:12:04,143 --> 00:12:05,943
Trying to disappear Nick?

84
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:09,547
He vote no country... no loyalty.

85
00:12:09,767 --> 00:12:12,490
No desires to get involve
in political bullshit.

86
00:12:28,349 --> 00:12:30,712
Nobody but you in this apartment
for a long time Nick?

87
00:12:30,902 --> 00:12:33,055
Why? Would someone else
besides me?

88
00:12:33,325 --> 00:12:34,325
A girl.

89
00:12:34,619 --> 00:12:36,619
She has something belonging to us.

90
00:12:36,919 --> 00:12:39,613
I give a hunch you know her?

91
00:12:41,275 --> 00:12:43,397
Obviously I don't.

92
00:12:47,692 --> 00:12:49,625
In case we need
to get a hold you again.

93
00:12:49,845 --> 00:12:52,859
I got some old toilet paper
you boys might like more.

94
00:12:53,139 --> 00:12:57,164
Do bother running Nick.
We know where you are now.

95
00:13:05,965 --> 00:13:06,965
Shit.

96
00:13:33,337 --> 00:13:35,089
Yeah?
Hey Nick.

97
00:13:35,320 --> 00:13:36,831
Who is this?
- Open up Nick.

98
00:13:37,793 --> 00:13:40,155
C'mon put your gun down.

99
00:13:52,951 --> 00:13:54,345
Put that thing away.

100
00:13:54,346 --> 00:13:56,346
I got you somethin'.

101
00:13:57,736 --> 00:14:00,249
Where is the chicken?
Oh, there it is.

102
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,250
Hey! Whoa, whoa!

103
00:14:04,435 --> 00:14:06,157
Excuse me.

104
00:14:06,427 --> 00:14:07,809
Is this how you treat your guest?

105
00:14:08,069 --> 00:14:09,993
This is how I treat
random strangers...

106
00:14:09,994 --> 00:14:11,923
who barge into my apartment.

107
00:14:11,924 --> 00:14:14,807
Like the Division's stepped first here.
Where just here.

108
00:14:14,927 --> 00:14:16,439
Who are you?

109
00:14:16,859 --> 00:14:18,551
I'm Cassie.

110
00:14:19,563 --> 00:14:21,745
I'm here to help you.

111
00:14:23,237 --> 00:14:24,685
Listen, Cassie...

112
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:26,836
sure your mom and dad are nervous
about you right now.

113
00:14:26,837 --> 00:14:27,886
So why don't you...

114
00:14:28,373 --> 00:14:30,416
You don't understand.
- You got that right.

115
00:14:31,317 --> 00:14:34,330
This is about us
finding six million dollars.

116
00:14:36,543 --> 00:14:37,698
That's us.

117
00:14:40,001 --> 00:14:41,699
and that's seven.

118
00:14:43,481 --> 00:14:44,875
That's my toothbrush.

119
00:14:45,876 --> 00:14:46,976
You're a "Watcher".

120
00:14:48,327 --> 00:14:51,591
So is your place can get
something to eat besides chicken?

121
00:14:54,294 --> 00:14:56,877
I'm buying.

122
00:15:09,678 --> 00:15:11,405
Lose your bet with a hair dresser?

123
00:15:11,806 --> 00:15:13,406
I like color.

124
00:15:56,509 --> 00:15:59,603
First things first.
I know you're a 2nd generation mover.

125
00:15:59,813 --> 00:16:03,001
Is that what the kids calling at these days?
- How'd you know I see one?

126
00:16:03,167 --> 00:16:05,400
You don't really use your powers
this means you haven't practice

127
00:16:05,401 --> 00:16:07,401
You kinda suck out of it.
How am I doing so far?

128
00:16:07,402 --> 00:16:08,001
Go on.

129
00:16:08,002 --> 00:16:09,114
I'm a watcher.

130
00:16:09,655 --> 00:16:11,807
2nd generation like you
- Wow.

131
00:16:12,068 --> 00:16:13,400
That's...
- Complicated...

132
00:16:13,401 --> 00:16:16,003
Cause the future can changes
by talking about it.

133
00:16:16,004 --> 00:16:17,588
So I see glimpses
and I draw it in my book.

134
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:19,389
But I'm not really good at it.

135
00:16:19,390 --> 00:16:20,990
I'm kinda crappy artist.
But...

136
00:16:21,591 --> 00:16:23,591
I'm sure you already knew that.

137
00:16:24,853 --> 00:16:27,046
I got to snooze
in your apartment, right?

138
00:16:27,226 --> 00:16:29,849
That's why I brought you
a new toothbrush.

139
00:16:32,552 --> 00:16:34,164
Do you speak Chinese?

140
00:16:34,415 --> 00:16:36,939
Cantonese.
Which part you didn't know that?

141
00:16:37,344 --> 00:16:38,100
being a watcher.

142
00:16:38,149 --> 00:16:40,200
I got things wrong sometimes.

143
00:16:40,201 --> 00:16:41,901
I know the feeling.

144
00:16:44,176 --> 00:16:47,000
Are you worried about the tugs
you owe money too?

145
00:16:47,001 --> 00:16:48,900
Don't.
Thank you.

146
00:16:48,901 --> 00:16:51,321
We'll be able to take care of it
in couple of days.

147
00:16:52,206 --> 00:16:54,789
With your six million dollars.

148
00:16:55,250 --> 00:16:57,444
Where is the money?
- Right here.

149
00:16:58,200 --> 00:17:00,445
With the girl.

150
00:17:00,636 --> 00:17:01,560
Don't tell me.

151
00:17:01,561 --> 00:17:04,561
The same girl Division's sniffs
are looking for.

152
00:17:07,424 --> 00:17:09,176
It's Cassie right?

153
00:17:09,647 --> 00:17:11,409
Enjoy your food.

154
00:17:12,030 --> 00:17:13,542
That's it?
- That's it.

155
00:17:13,792 --> 00:17:16,331
Sorry, some twelve year old that knew
that I needed a new toothbrush

156
00:17:16,332 --> 00:17:18,106
isn't enough to get me involved
with a vision...

157
00:17:18,107 --> 00:17:20,230
even if it's not a con.

158
00:17:21,441 --> 00:17:24,525
I'm thirteen and I've been told that
at least I look fourteen.

159
00:17:24,775 --> 00:17:26,898
Right.
- And this is not a con.

160
00:17:27,218 --> 00:17:29,400
This is a way for everybody who's
something that they want.

161
00:17:29,541 --> 00:17:32,159
I actually used that line before.
- Fine.

162
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,960
Don't believe me.

163
00:17:34,977 --> 00:17:36,299
But you will help me.

164
00:17:36,759 --> 00:17:39,877
Really? Coz I'm getting
a message and it's telling me...

165
00:17:39,878 --> 00:17:42,326
Find somebody else.

166
00:17:43,828 --> 00:17:45,586
If we do not find the case
and that girl...

167
00:17:45,587 --> 00:17:47,887
really bad things happen, Nick.

168
00:17:49,655 --> 00:17:52,198
What?
What's wrong?

169
00:17:56,353 --> 00:17:57,276
Shit.

170
00:17:58,277 --> 00:17:59,666
They're here in the market.

171
00:17:59,667 --> 00:18:00,419
Who?

172
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,420
Who?

173
00:18:02,421 --> 00:18:04,052
They're in the market, come on!

174
00:18:04,053 --> 00:18:05,385
The vision?
- Bleeders!

175
00:18:05,386 --> 00:18:06,986
We gotta get out of here!

176
00:18:21,353 --> 00:18:22,604
How does this end?
- No idea.

177
00:18:22,855 --> 00:18:23,879
Where is the girl?

178
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:26,603
My daughter has already
seen you with her.

179
00:18:26,604 --> 00:18:27,604
Told you?

180
00:18:29,269 --> 00:18:32,577
Look I told three people already today
I do not know this girl.

181
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,298
Stupid child.

182
00:18:35,299 --> 00:18:36,948
I already saw how you die.

183
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:39,745
Then you know it's not here
and it's not today.

184
00:23:29,363 --> 00:23:31,355
I already know you're here.

185
00:23:39,355 --> 00:23:42,148
You must be Cassie Holmes?

186
00:23:42,479 --> 00:23:45,092
Who sent you?
- Your mother.

187
00:23:47,254 --> 00:23:49,249
A week before
she was captured by Division,

188
00:23:49,250 --> 00:23:52,250
she told me to be
in that fish market today.

189
00:23:53,302 --> 00:23:55,344
Stay away from him!

190
00:23:55,624 --> 00:23:56,689
It's that what you want?

191
00:23:56,690 --> 00:23:59,995
Just be sure to had he's picture
to the wall of the dead.

192
00:24:01,191 --> 00:24:04,345
You stitch?
- That should be obvious to a watcher.

193
00:24:05,136 --> 00:24:07,659
You had even a modo come
with your mother's talent.

194
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:09,193
I've been dealing with a lot.

195
00:24:09,194 --> 00:24:10,194
Years ago...

196
00:24:10,195 --> 00:24:11,795
your mother did me a favor

197
00:24:11,796 --> 00:24:14,796
Now that's seem
I need to pay off my debt.

198
00:24:34,351 --> 00:24:38,616
I heard they got your mother
buried deep inside Division.

199
00:24:40,478 --> 00:24:44,873
So drugged up, she can't even
hold a spoon.

200
00:24:45,454 --> 00:24:49,709
I bet they suck
the future right out of her.

201
00:25:23,610 --> 00:25:25,710
You help her and you help us all.

202
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:28,711
with flower...

203
00:25:45,676 --> 00:25:47,829
Is he okay?

204
00:26:22,821 --> 00:26:25,474
Are you okay?
- Yeah.

205
00:26:31,421 --> 00:26:34,035
That woman got a magic fingers.

206
00:26:42,885 --> 00:26:44,968
For you.

207
00:26:45,248 --> 00:26:49,443
What is that?
- A lotus.

208
00:27:09,838 --> 00:27:12,060
I heard what she said
about your mother said?

209
00:27:13,542 --> 00:27:15,755
You did?

210
00:27:18,588 --> 00:27:20,355
Division's got her.

211
00:27:21,356 --> 00:27:24,956
They locked her up because she's
a greatest watcher I've ever seen.

212
00:27:25,246 --> 00:27:27,108
They're afraid of her.

213
00:27:27,349 --> 00:27:29,872
They afraid they can't control her.

214
00:27:30,743 --> 00:27:33,296
They killed my father
for the same reason.

215
00:27:35,608 --> 00:27:37,761
I guess you already knew that.

216
00:27:38,472 --> 00:27:41,586
I see the future not the past.

217
00:27:43,097 --> 00:27:47,222
Right now our future isn't that great.

218
00:27:48,494 --> 00:27:50,276
That's a note?

219
00:27:50,606 --> 00:27:54,071
Now they're messing your apartment.
I need to get the girl and the case.

220
00:27:55,632 --> 00:27:59,497
It's changed.
I don't know why.

221
00:28:00,398 --> 00:28:03,222
Something I did...
A mistake I made...

222
00:28:04,133 --> 00:28:07,817
Doesn't matter...
Just has...

223
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:12,983
My mother told me that suitcase...

224
00:28:13,224 --> 00:28:14,926
was the key to bring down Division.

225
00:28:14,927 --> 00:28:16,627
And free her.

226
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:22,365
There is no money in that case,
is there?

227
00:28:25,528 --> 00:28:27,584
Now lets' not missing something.

228
00:28:28,585 --> 00:28:30,585
They don't have the case yet.

229
00:28:31,746 --> 00:28:34,369
It's still out there.

230
00:28:36,972 --> 00:28:38,744
If your mother is such
a great fortune teller.

231
00:28:38,745 --> 00:28:40,745
How she get caught?

232
00:28:40,937 --> 00:28:43,160
I just got to ask that to myself.

233
00:28:43,800 --> 00:28:46,461
I haven't gotten to the bad part yet.

234
00:28:49,878 --> 00:28:51,560
What is that?

235
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,363
We die.

236
00:28:55,264 --> 00:28:57,256
Great.

237
00:29:22,041 --> 00:29:23,557
Hello Kira.

238
00:29:28,900 --> 00:29:30,500
You have a plane to catch.

239
00:29:30,000 --> 00:29:33,000
Come on.
- You wanna come with us.

240
00:29:46,526 --> 00:29:48,824
Christ.
Get a load of that.

241
00:29:49,225 --> 00:29:50,825
She uses that right?

242
00:29:50,926 --> 00:29:53,826
Ten times a day.
- Yeah that should keep her.

243
00:29:53,995 --> 00:29:56,649
Your not could be having a lot of
lipstick opportunities where you goin'

244
00:29:56,650 --> 00:29:57,950
You know what I mean?

245
00:30:02,024 --> 00:30:03,024
She's doin' that again.

246
00:30:03,025 --> 00:30:05,725
Get the hell outta my head!
- No, no, no!

247
00:30:06,730 --> 00:30:07,721
What does she want?

248
00:30:07,951 --> 00:30:09,283
She's gotta go to the bathroom...

249
00:30:09,284 --> 00:30:10,884
to throw-up or something.

250
00:30:10,935 --> 00:30:13,888
Carver will kills us
if anything happens to her.

251
00:30:27,545 --> 00:30:29,597
Bathroom?
- This way.

252
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:32,598
C'mon.

253
00:30:36,000 --> 00:30:38,699
Coffee, black, no sugar.

254
00:30:52,715 --> 00:30:54,438
Alright.
In you go.

255
00:31:08,434 --> 00:31:11,197
You are a good man agent Mack.

256
00:31:11,688 --> 00:31:14,186
I bet you come from a good family?

257
00:31:15,987 --> 00:31:18,187
It must have been hard for you
when he died?

258
00:31:18,766 --> 00:31:20,000
Who died?

259
00:31:21,001 --> 00:31:22,300
Your brother.

260
00:31:23,152 --> 00:31:25,304
I don't have a brother sweetheart.
- No you do.

261
00:31:26,205 --> 00:31:28,858
I got something
to make you feel better.

262
00:31:29,239 --> 00:31:31,435
And you loved him very much.

263
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,172
But he was murdered.

264
00:31:36,573 --> 00:31:39,173
And he know who did it.
Don't you?

265
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:52,674
But he was murdered.

266
00:31:52,675 --> 00:31:54,675
And he know who did it.
Don't you?

267
00:31:59,676 --> 00:32:01,676
And he know who did it.
Don't you?

268
00:32:01,677 --> 00:32:02,877
But he was murdered.

269
00:32:16,578 --> 00:32:18,287
And he know who did it.

270
00:32:18,288 --> 00:32:21,288
he was murdered.

271
00:34:24,589 --> 00:34:25,289
Lame.

272
00:34:26,239 --> 00:34:29,426
You gotta find your skill or
we won't not change anything.

273
00:34:29,427 --> 00:34:30,627
Don't bite you nail.

274
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,306
A lollipop should freeze me up.

275
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:39,000
She's a watcher.

276
00:34:39,100 --> 00:34:42,000
Like you?
- Yeah.

277
00:34:42,541 --> 00:34:45,566
Hey, I know this place.
This is um...

278
00:34:46,256 --> 00:34:47,521
I know this place.

279
00:34:47,522 --> 00:34:50,422
Club B Boss.
Science Museum Road.

280
00:34:50,423 --> 00:34:51,623
Thank you.

281
00:34:53,324 --> 00:34:55,877
Why is it all about at the Boss?

282
00:34:56,348 --> 00:35:00,141
That's not olive it's a bead.
- It's a bead?

283
00:34:59,962 --> 00:35:02,586
Yeah, it's a bead.
It's a shimmering...

284
00:35:02,587 --> 00:35:03,587
similar to that.

285
00:35:03,588 --> 00:35:06,400
Oh. It's look like a pimiento,
if I was gonna draw a bead...

286
00:35:06,401 --> 00:35:08,801
It's bead with a shimmer.

287
00:35:08,522 --> 00:35:10,474
What does a bead
have to do with it?

288
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:13,422
I don't know what the shiny
shimmering bead has to do with it.

289
00:35:13,423 --> 00:35:14,323
Great.

290
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,135
Alright let's keep it simple.

291
00:35:17,136 --> 00:35:19,436
Let's start with the bead and
see where it take us.

292
00:35:19,437 --> 00:35:21,172
Sounds like a plan but...

293
00:35:21,173 --> 00:35:23,814
What about the part all we die.

294
00:35:37,757 --> 00:35:39,942
I remember growing up together...

295
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:42,032
Where we went to school.

296
00:35:42,445 --> 00:35:43,996
How he died.

297
00:35:45,397 --> 00:35:48,031
Excepts for this brother
you never had.

298
00:35:48,032 --> 00:35:51,723
Is there anything else
you might have to put in your head?

299
00:35:51,724 --> 00:35:54,252
I'm only asking because
I don't wanna be shot in the face

300
00:35:54,253 --> 00:35:57,400
with screw-up made up sister
you don't really have.

301
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,000
I don't have a sister?

302
00:36:06,051 --> 00:36:07,939
Agent Mack...

303
00:36:07,940 --> 00:36:09,323
Your relieve of duty.

304
00:36:09,324 --> 00:36:11,500
Get on the plane.
Eat some peanuts and go home.

305
00:36:11,501 --> 00:36:13,918
She won't push me again sir?
She just caught me off guard.

306
00:36:14,131 --> 00:36:16,995
The only thoughts in my head
are my own.

307
00:36:17,785 --> 00:36:20,569
You’re willing to risk
your life on that?

308
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:22,244
Yes sir.

309
00:36:22,245 --> 00:36:25,545
The put the gun in your mouth
and pull the trigger.

310
00:36:29,079 --> 00:36:30,588
Don't worry...

311
00:36:30,589 --> 00:36:34,331
We already checked it.
It's not loaded.

312
00:36:42,095 --> 00:36:45,000
Spread these beads to any sniff,
any watcher.

313
00:36:45,001 --> 00:36:48,474
Any goddamn expectorate reader
in Hong Kong who knows up and down...

314
00:36:48,963 --> 00:36:50,598
Until we find Kira.

315
00:36:51,100 --> 00:36:53,599
What about the Chinese government
and there guys?

316
00:36:53,600 --> 00:36:54,791
If the story is out

317
00:36:54,792 --> 00:36:57,100
believers all over the country
will be looking for it.

318
00:36:57,101 --> 00:36:58,874
We can't let them get the drug.

319
00:36:58,875 --> 00:37:01,598
Or we will put a price on her head.

320
00:37:08,426 --> 00:37:10,452
Yeah, this is it.

321
00:37:10,553 --> 00:37:11,553
Hey, can you...

322
00:37:11,754 --> 00:37:13,211
I just...
Put on everything.

323
00:37:13,212 --> 00:37:16,005
Yeah, sure.

324
00:37:17,017 --> 00:37:18,355
There you go.

325
00:37:18,356 --> 00:37:20,156
You can keep it.
Thanks.

326
00:37:23,157 --> 00:37:25,582
How much do you have?...
- Don't get more back.

327
00:37:25,583 --> 00:37:26,558
That's not in the deal.
- It's enough!

328
00:37:26,559 --> 00:37:28,759
It's not gonna be... Just give me...
- It's enough!

329
00:37:29,141 --> 00:37:31,434
Hey! We need 5 minutes.
5 minutes.

330
00:37:32,986 --> 00:37:34,712
Now listen. This is ah...

331
00:37:35,374 --> 00:37:36,366
A place for grown-ups.

332
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:38,371
So behave yourself.
- Shut up.

333
00:37:38,673 --> 00:37:40,935
Sounds about right.

334
00:37:46,800 --> 00:37:48,501
Now here's another one.
- Yes, please.

335
00:37:48,502 --> 00:37:49,502
Show me more...

336
00:37:49,503 --> 00:37:51,503
One more?
- Yes, please.

337
00:37:51,504 --> 00:37:53,084
Queen of hearts
- Perfect.

338
00:37:53,085 --> 00:37:54,085
Watch, slowly...

339
00:37:58,585 --> 00:38:00,085
Show me, show me...

340
00:38:00,886 --> 00:38:02,086
Ace of spades.

341
00:38:07,017 --> 00:38:09,409
I think I know why we're here.

342
00:38:11,410 --> 00:38:13,410
Got good hands.
- Nick

343
00:38:13,411 --> 00:38:15,411
Your alone?
- Yeah. You?

344
00:38:15,412 --> 00:38:17,412
What's goin on?
- Okay. Sit down.

345
00:38:18,841 --> 00:38:20,082
Vodka Martini.
- Thank you.

346
00:38:20,083 --> 00:38:22,083
I'll have one of those.

347
00:38:22,505 --> 00:38:23,757
She'll have a coke.

348
00:38:24,037 --> 00:38:26,382
My mom drinks when
she wants really clear images.

349
00:38:26,383 --> 00:38:27,680
She's famous for it.

350
00:38:27,681 --> 00:38:29,750
Maybe something without caffeine.

351
00:38:29,751 --> 00:38:31,557
I got it.

352
00:38:32,558 --> 00:38:33,558
That's five.

353
00:38:35,559 --> 00:38:37,559
Keep the change.
- Thank you.

354
00:38:40,577 --> 00:38:42,514
I know who you are.

355
00:38:44,723 --> 00:38:46,093
When I was in Division...

356
00:38:46,094 --> 00:38:48,982
Your mother was at the top
of every watch list there was.

357
00:38:49,437 --> 00:38:52,491
You work for the Division?

358
00:38:54,754 --> 00:38:56,709
You wanna know about the Division?

359
00:38:58,256 --> 00:38:59,710
Ten years.

360
00:38:59,711 --> 00:39:01,547
No thank you. No pension.

361
00:39:01,548 --> 00:39:04,409
I was put out on the street
with a threat to not shift again.

362
00:39:05,697 --> 00:39:08,134
Under the sniffs
caught up with me in Chicago.

363
00:39:08,135 --> 00:39:11,448
I was just trying to buy
something nice for my wife.

364
00:39:11,874 --> 00:39:14,150
Next day a get a call...

365
00:39:14,151 --> 00:39:15,151
She’s dead.

366
00:39:16,288 --> 00:39:18,152
Car accident.

367
00:39:19,235 --> 00:39:22,153
But my wife... doesn’t drive.

368
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:28,838
But I don't have to remind you
how that feels. Right.

369
00:39:34,512 --> 00:39:37,205
We need this.
- An olive?

370
00:39:37,866 --> 00:39:39,658
It's a bead.

371
00:39:40,549 --> 00:39:43,972
It's suppose to lead us to someone
we need find before Division does.

372
00:39:45,164 --> 00:39:47,717
Excuse me.
May I?

373
00:39:50,200 --> 00:39:53,394
Thank you.
- You 're welcome.

374
00:39:57,219 --> 00:39:59,029
Got it right.

375
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:02,391
It's a little more round and shinier.

376
00:40:02,966 --> 00:40:06,760
That's it.
It's just how I saw it.

377
00:40:08,653 --> 00:40:10,493
It won't last long.

378
00:40:10,494 --> 00:40:14,309
I'll take you to Emily Hu.
She's ex-half sniff.

379
00:40:14,450 --> 00:40:17,173
Only works by referral.
Here's her address.

380
00:40:18,665 --> 00:40:20,130
Thank you.

381
00:40:22,200 --> 00:40:23,131
Bye, bye.

382
00:40:24,288 --> 00:40:25,988
Good luck.

383
00:41:16,554 --> 00:41:19,948
Can I help you?
- Hook Waters sent us.

384
00:41:20,629 --> 00:41:24,219
A bead that looks like this one
supposed to lead us to a girl.

385
00:41:30,821 --> 00:41:32,670
Are you with Division?

386
00:41:34,100 --> 00:41:36,122
Are looking at us?

387
00:41:36,578 --> 00:41:38,661
The truth is,
the girl who dropped that bead...

388
00:41:38,901 --> 00:41:41,566
is supposed to have a suitcase
that will bring down Division.

389
00:41:41,567 --> 00:41:43,730
Cassie here thinks, if we don't find it...

390
00:41:43,731 --> 00:41:44,867
We die.

391
00:41:44,868 --> 00:41:46,750
And you believe her?

392
00:41:47,802 --> 00:41:49,624
She's pretty convincing.

393
00:41:50,044 --> 00:41:52,367
Well, consider me unconvinced.

394
00:41:59,926 --> 00:42:03,162
Well it looks like we gotta wait.
- For what?

395
00:42:03,163 --> 00:42:05,722
You have about one minute to help us.

396
00:42:06,895 --> 00:42:10,889
And what's that?
- That's your poster.

397
00:42:12,071 --> 00:42:14,694
That is the bead.
- That's the clock.

398
00:42:16,086 --> 00:42:18,038
You got but a minute.

399
00:42:20,631 --> 00:42:22,513
You guys can't be serious?

400
00:42:22,784 --> 00:42:24,231
Don't look at me.

401
00:42:24,232 --> 00:42:26,517
This girl has been going out
with that pen all day.

402
00:42:26,518 --> 00:42:29,421
Everything that ends up on this pad
seems to become true.

403
00:42:29,422 --> 00:42:32,475
I just see it like I'm looking
at the photograph.

404
00:42:36,330 --> 00:42:37,330
Look.

405
00:42:37,331 --> 00:42:40,331
We want Division out of Hong Kong
just as much as you do.

406
00:42:40,495 --> 00:42:43,674
It's gonna be a whole lot easier
if you help us find the girl.

407
00:42:53,420 --> 00:42:55,303
Alright.

408
00:42:58,366 --> 00:43:02,091
They've been spreading these
all over the city.

409
00:43:13,454 --> 00:43:15,708
You'll find who you’re looking for...

410
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:18,709
on Kwun Tung Pier.

411
00:43:49,588 --> 00:43:51,197
Excuse me?

412
00:43:52,198 --> 00:43:55,485
Excuse me?
Speak in English?

413
00:43:56,376 --> 00:43:59,127
No? That doesn't really matter...

414
00:43:59,128 --> 00:44:01,869
I just need a ride.

415
00:44:02,870 --> 00:44:04,870
Where old friends, right?

416
00:44:11,194 --> 00:44:13,877
No, no, I should have called.
Sorry.

417
00:44:33,591 --> 00:44:35,162
Kira?

418
00:44:35,163 --> 00:44:36,163
Damn it!

419
00:44:36,164 --> 00:44:37,154
What the hell you're doing here?

420
00:44:37,155 --> 00:44:39,656
There goes my ride.
Let's go.

421
00:44:39,657 --> 00:44:40,657
Go, what?

422
00:44:40,950 --> 00:44:42,952
You’re the girl everyone's looking for?

423
00:44:42,953 --> 00:44:45,851
I should kill you Nick.
- You know this psycho?

424
00:44:45,852 --> 00:44:47,587
What happened to you?
- Now you wanna know?

425
00:44:47,668 --> 00:44:49,289
What is that supposed to mean?

426
00:44:49,290 --> 00:44:51,121
I thought you'd left,
You stopped returning my calls.

427
00:44:51,122 --> 00:44:53,044
Division caught me and locked me up.
- What?!

428
00:44:53,545 --> 00:44:54,766
And you never came!

429
00:44:55,066 --> 00:44:57,059
I looked for you!
I did!

430
00:44:58,671 --> 00:45:01,054
You didn't find me.

431
00:45:01,444 --> 00:45:03,927
Done.
Whatever you had a thing, get over it.

432
00:45:04,197 --> 00:45:06,921
I really suggest
we discuss this somewhere else.

433
00:45:08,152 --> 00:45:09,304
Let's go.

434
00:45:23,511 --> 00:45:26,204
Kira. Division's looking for you.

435
00:45:26,454 --> 00:45:29,978
They're looking for the case
and so are you.

436
00:45:30,379 --> 00:45:32,371
What's in that case Kira?

437
00:45:32,592 --> 00:45:33,588
I do not know...

438
00:45:34,289 --> 00:45:37,123
All I know is, as a woke-up on a boat
next to a note I written

439
00:45:37,124 --> 00:45:40,124
saying to look for you
and help me find the case.

440
00:45:41,522 --> 00:45:44,713
I don't remember anything
but last couple of days.

441
00:45:45,414 --> 00:45:47,689
No matter how hard I try.

442
00:45:47,690 --> 00:45:49,365
You must had yourself wacked.

443
00:45:50,366 --> 00:45:53,366
Erased memories makes harder
for the Division to track you.

444
00:45:55,459 --> 00:45:58,713
Not the ones of you.

445
00:46:00,245 --> 00:46:02,668
Can I talk to you for a sec?

446
00:46:02,988 --> 00:46:04,128
You wait.

447
00:46:04,129 --> 00:46:07,129
I'm kinda in the middle of something.
- No.

448
00:46:11,678 --> 00:46:14,031
You, me and my mom.

449
00:46:14,292 --> 00:46:16,945
I've never seen my mom's
death before.

450
00:46:17,205 --> 00:46:19,288
It's her Nick.

451
00:46:19,578 --> 00:46:22,121
She changing the future,
she's making it worst.

452
00:46:22,371 --> 00:46:23,877
We gotta dump her.
- Don't.

453
00:46:24,199 --> 00:46:25,878
Cassie...

454
00:46:27,267 --> 00:46:28,393
Cassie, we just found her.

455
00:46:28,394 --> 00:46:30,116
And she doesn't have the case

456
00:46:30,117 --> 00:46:31,970
Which is what we're looking for
if you remember?

457
00:46:31,971 --> 00:46:32,971
Yeah. I know.

458
00:46:33,685 --> 00:46:36,583
We find her, we find the case.
The three of us.

459
00:46:36,584 --> 00:46:40,789
Yeah and the Division finds her.
Oh yeah, the three of us.

460
00:46:43,106 --> 00:46:45,608
We'll get a "Shadow",
so they can't trace her.

461
00:46:45,609 --> 00:46:47,609
Satisfied?
- No!

462
00:46:48,863 --> 00:46:50,747
Cassie you gotta trust me.

463
00:46:50,748 --> 00:46:52,527
Hey, I'm not falling
for trust issues here.

464
00:46:52,728 --> 00:46:53,897
You better do something quick,

465
00:46:53,898 --> 00:46:56,898
cause' I'm getting sick
of drawing dead bodies.

466
00:47:25,899 --> 00:47:26,899
That's him.

467
00:47:28,250 --> 00:47:29,832
Hey Pinky.
- Hey Nick.

468
00:47:29,833 --> 00:47:30,833
How ya doin'?

469
00:47:31,014 --> 00:47:33,407
Alright we're feeling the heat.

470
00:47:34,758 --> 00:47:38,272
Alright...
Here's how this works.

471
00:47:38,653 --> 00:47:41,262
I get 10 gran a day for shadowing
miss trouble.

472
00:47:40,926 --> 00:47:43,045
As long as  she stays
within 20 feet of me

473
00:47:43,046 --> 00:47:44,046
no sniffs gonna find her.

474
00:47:44,059 --> 00:47:47,614
I don't care if they're standing
right on top of us and a piece of finger nail.

475
00:47:47,834 --> 00:47:50,217
Happy?
- Overcome.

476
00:47:50,467 --> 00:47:52,660
Now c'mon,
let's find a place to think.

477
00:47:55,213 --> 00:47:56,593
So Pinky...

478
00:47:57,594 --> 00:47:59,207
your wife give you that name?

479
00:47:59,208 --> 00:48:04,200
No, the Division gave it sweetheart.
Back in the day.

480
00:48:12,544 --> 00:48:15,923
I'm Sorry, I can't remember
anything about the case.

481
00:48:16,098 --> 00:48:18,491
Shocking.

482
00:48:21,064 --> 00:48:23,551
Can I clean-up
without getting killed?

483
00:48:23,552 --> 00:48:26,025
Do not forget to wash
behind your ears.

484
00:48:29,744 --> 00:48:32,357
Nice girlfriend you got there.
- Yeah.

485
00:48:32,718 --> 00:48:34,393
She used to be.

486
00:48:34,394 --> 00:48:37,394
I met her when I cons
on Coney Island tourists.

487
00:48:38,395 --> 00:48:40,433
We did everything together.
I mean...

488
00:48:40,434 --> 00:48:41,901
So we're just gonna sit around

489
00:48:41,902 --> 00:48:43,748
and wait for her
to get her memory back.

490
00:48:43,749 --> 00:48:47,344
And hope that she'll tell where
the case is before Carver gets it.

491
00:48:47,645 --> 00:48:48,931
Or us.

492
00:48:49,957 --> 00:48:51,422
Great plan.

493
00:48:51,923 --> 00:48:53,123
Where you going?

494
00:48:53,062 --> 00:48:55,795
It's not chicken place down stairs.
Wanna come?

495
00:48:55,796 --> 00:48:58,516
No, I'm good, I gonna stay here.
See if I can help.

496
00:48:58,517 --> 00:48:59,870
Have fun with that.

497
00:49:19,684 --> 00:49:21,777
Where're you going?

498
00:49:22,057 --> 00:49:26,052
Relax Romeo,
I can shade her just fine out the hall.

499
00:49:26,803 --> 00:49:30,330
I don't need to be watcher
to see where this is going.

500
00:50:20,317 --> 00:50:22,610
Sorry.

501
00:50:22,840 --> 00:50:25,493
I thought the bathroom
was on fire.

502
00:50:25,723 --> 00:50:28,617
I had to get you
to come in somehow.

503
00:50:29,037 --> 00:50:32,080
Did you push me?
- You like it?

504
00:50:34,033 --> 00:50:37,057
Sure.

505
00:51:11,278 --> 00:51:14,068
My father expects me
to find that suitcase.

506
00:51:14,069 --> 00:51:16,069
So does my mother.

507
00:51:16,070 --> 00:51:18,738
But you don't see it clearly.
Do you?

508
00:51:18,739 --> 00:51:20,739
Too many things keep changing.

509
00:51:21,681 --> 00:51:24,566
I already saw how you die.

510
00:51:24,567 --> 00:51:26,567
Did you see it here?

511
00:51:31,112 --> 00:51:32,951
You can change it you know.

512
00:51:32,952 --> 00:51:35,597
Plenty of time to live
in Hong Kong every day.

513
00:51:35,598 --> 00:51:38,031
Oh, we are going to change it.

514
00:51:38,032 --> 00:51:40,383
You put a shadow on the girl.

515
00:51:40,384 --> 00:51:43,248
You know that's only temporary.

516
00:51:43,407 --> 00:51:47,749
That girl is the one who brings
all your little fantasies crushing down.

517
00:51:47,772 --> 00:51:50,285
So tell Nick something
for me little girl.

518
00:51:50,586 --> 00:51:54,229
Tell him my family gonna make
his brain pop like a tomato.

519
00:51:54,230 --> 00:51:58,625
Tell him that's the future I see.

520
00:52:12,041 --> 00:52:14,324
Oh boy.

521
00:52:15,970 --> 00:52:16,970
Hello!

522
00:52:19,900 --> 00:52:21,971
Where's the chicky, chicky
who can suck heel.

523
00:52:22,023 --> 00:52:24,206
Are you drunk?
- Yeah.

524
00:52:24,656 --> 00:52:27,248
Sorry, you know the procedure,
stuffs not good for 10 year old.

525
00:52:27,249 --> 00:52:31,283
I'm thirteen!
And I'm empowering my youth!

526
00:52:31,284 --> 00:52:34,648
I can't believe this.
- I am worth it.

527
00:52:35,249 --> 00:52:38,843
You screw it all up!
- Alright. Give me this.

528
00:52:38,844 --> 00:52:39,844
What is this?

529
00:52:39,845 --> 00:52:41,685
We talked about this Cassie,
nobody's going anywhere.

530
00:52:41,686 --> 00:52:43,679
What's this?
- You don't get it Nick.

531
00:52:44,430 --> 00:52:46,823
She wanna kill us all basically.

532
00:52:47,073 --> 00:52:49,665
But I guess we all gonna get killed.
- Yeah. Screwed up.

533
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:53,537
What "we" you mean that?
- You too!

534
00:52:54,538 --> 00:52:57,461
Pop Girl is a better
watcher than I am.

535
00:52:57,462 --> 00:52:59,862
Whoa. No one said anything
about a watcher.

536
00:52:59,863 --> 00:53:02,098
I can only work long term
against the sniffs.

537
00:53:02,099 --> 00:53:03,452
Good.
- No.

538
00:53:03,453 --> 00:53:07,047
True story, you gotta watch her after you.
It's just a matter of time.

539
00:53:07,658 --> 00:53:10,528
Alright then, we'll split up.

540
00:53:10,529 --> 00:53:12,534
We got two things to track
instead of one.

541
00:53:10,481 --> 00:53:12,474
It will be more difficult to keep two things
that one.

542
00:53:12,774 --> 00:53:14,316
Pinky, you take Kira somewhere safe.

543
00:53:14,317 --> 00:53:16,327
No. I'm not going with him.

544
00:53:16,358 --> 00:53:19,536
No offense.
- Non taken cupcake.

545
00:53:19,537 --> 00:53:21,273
I know your sweet on the champ.

546
00:53:21,274 --> 00:53:22,756
I'll find him.

547
00:53:35,551 --> 00:53:37,334
Let's let her sleep.

548
00:54:04,204 --> 00:54:05,887
She saw me coming.

549
00:54:10,994 --> 00:54:12,616
She is still dies.

550
00:54:20,696 --> 00:54:22,618
She's gone now.

551
00:54:24,911 --> 00:54:26,693
I'm just saying.

552
00:54:29,817 --> 00:54:32,478
You okay?
- No.

553
00:54:34,302 --> 00:54:36,666
Not until we find that case.

554
00:54:37,367 --> 00:54:38,876
When was the last time you saw it?

555
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:40,824
Not since yesterday.

556
00:54:40,830 --> 00:54:42,482
No luck on trying.

557
00:54:44,674 --> 00:54:46,728
If we don't find it soon...

558
00:54:46,729 --> 00:54:48,404
Their gonna kill my mom.

559
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,990
And it's gonna be my fault.

560
00:55:07,822 --> 00:55:08,623
Look at me.

561
00:55:10,005 --> 00:55:11,829
Hey! Look at me.

562
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:14,104
Will you think I'm gonna let that happen?

563
00:55:15,105 --> 00:55:17,105
Now you said the future
is always changing.

564
00:55:17,106 --> 00:55:19,998
Are there changes by just knowing it?
- You can change it.

565
00:55:20,181 --> 00:55:21,922
Doesn't mean it will.

566
00:55:24,602 --> 00:55:26,738
Good enough.
- What are you doing?

567
00:55:26,739 --> 00:55:28,014
What are your gun gonna do?

568
00:55:28,015 --> 00:55:30,015
Gonna try to make a better one.

569
00:55:30,389 --> 00:55:32,845
Going after Carver
doesn't change anything.

570
00:55:32,846 --> 00:55:33,707
It doesn't save me.

571
00:55:33,708 --> 00:55:35,708
It doesn't save you.
It doesn't save her.

572
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:37,623
It's just a matter of time Cassie.

573
00:55:37,624 --> 00:55:39,820
If I don't go to him,
he'll come for us.

574
00:55:48,311 --> 00:55:49,763
Emily it's Nick.

575
00:55:50,644 --> 00:55:51,295
Listen.

576
00:55:51,296 --> 00:55:53,280
The Division sent a pusher
named "Carver" to Hong Kong.

577
00:55:53,281 --> 00:55:54,500
I need you to find him.

578
00:55:56,400 --> 00:55:59,780
Just use that feed I gave you.
I'm sure his hands are all over it.

579
00:56:29,439 --> 00:56:30,730
I'm not hungry.

580
00:57:28,231 --> 00:57:30,353
Henry Carver.

581
00:57:33,567 --> 00:57:36,600
Now. That's a face I've haven't
seen a long time.

582
00:57:42,658 --> 00:57:43,932
Sit down.

583
00:57:44,933 --> 00:57:46,933
Pushing action pretty good there.

584
00:57:53,051 --> 00:57:55,890
Give me one good reason
not to kill you right now.

585
00:57:57,556 --> 00:57:58,637
Good.

586
00:57:59,138 --> 00:58:01,464
Your trying to get inside my head.

587
00:58:02,191 --> 00:58:03,322
Go ahead.

588
00:58:03,423 --> 00:58:06,199
See if you can push me
before I can pull the trigger.

589
00:58:07,318 --> 00:58:11,600
Well, ten years is a long time
to hold the grudge.

590
00:58:11,601 --> 00:58:13,503
My father would disagree.

591
00:58:13,800 --> 00:58:17,349
Piece a shit.
- Your father, I have respect for

592
00:58:17,350 --> 00:58:19,965
He took a stand
with great integrity.

593
00:58:19,966 --> 00:58:22,744
Which more than anyone
can say about you.

594
00:58:27,352 --> 00:58:30,605
This is your attempt to...
- They gotta know this future?

595
00:58:31,877 --> 00:58:35,466
I've got twenty of the best
watchers in the world

596
00:58:35,467 --> 00:58:37,614
tracking every moment
of this time right now.

597
00:58:39,656 --> 00:58:41,669
You die, Nick.

598
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,022
You all die.

599
00:58:44,923 --> 00:58:46,997
Know who doesn't?

600
00:58:47,861 --> 00:58:48,739
Me.

601
00:58:48,727 --> 00:58:50,427
Are you sure about that?

602
00:58:52,373 --> 00:58:53,442
Okay.

603
00:58:55,443 --> 00:58:57,826
Kira is our patient "Zero"...

604
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:00,642
and with her,
we're going to create an army

605
00:59:00,643 --> 00:59:03,800
the world has never seen before.
- I'm sorry? Am I suppose to care?

606
00:59:03,355 --> 00:59:04,865
Fine.

607
00:59:05,598 --> 00:59:07,000
Fuck the jurydism.

608
00:59:07,540 --> 00:59:11,229
The girl will die unless she
receives the necessary injections.

609
00:59:12,115 --> 00:59:15,890
And you’re not going to find it
anywhere but with me.

610
00:59:17,101 --> 00:59:18,984
Maybe you care about her.

611
00:59:23,129 --> 00:59:25,006
Tell me something Nick.

612
00:59:25,900 --> 00:59:28,500
Her blood turned black yet?

613
00:59:29,301 --> 00:59:30,241
No.

614
00:59:30,242 --> 00:59:31,242
Inside it's running out.

615
00:59:35,584 --> 00:59:38,126
Why she keep the matter away
from you too?

616
00:59:44,755 --> 00:59:46,937
I take that as a yes.

617
01:01:57,784 --> 01:01:59,967
You already know
the ending to this story.

618
01:02:00,428 --> 01:02:02,650
You can only draw it
in so many ways.

619
01:02:05,854 --> 01:02:07,136
I going to change it.

620
01:02:10,490 --> 01:02:12,442
You don't believe that, do you?

621
01:02:12,943 --> 01:02:14,334
Please.

622
01:02:15,976 --> 01:02:18,459
Don't make me do
anything to myself.

623
01:02:19,370 --> 01:02:21,833
Hurting you
won't change the future.

624
01:02:22,314 --> 01:02:24,797
Like how this future goes...

625
01:02:25,528 --> 01:02:27,150
So, by killing him?

626
01:02:43,009 --> 01:02:44,330
Victor!

627
01:03:04,595 --> 01:03:06,447
I think I just save your life.

628
01:03:07,628 --> 01:03:08,800
No need to thank me.

629
01:03:08,801 --> 01:03:11,100
You should just start
listening to me.

630
01:03:16,849 --> 01:03:18,311
You look like shit.

631
01:03:37,504 --> 01:03:39,446
Where is she?
- 5A.

632
01:03:39,837 --> 01:03:41,098
Is she safe?

633
01:03:41,099 --> 01:03:43,469
She's sick though. Pretty bad.

634
01:04:32,112 --> 01:04:34,518
I need to ask you a question.

635
01:04:36,500 --> 01:04:38,119
What's in the case?

636
01:04:42,900 --> 01:04:44,120
It's a drug.

637
01:04:45,050 --> 01:04:49,660
Some sort of psychic steroid
that boost our abilities.

638
01:04:49,661 --> 01:04:51,283
Or kills us.

639
01:04:55,818 --> 01:04:57,251
He want me back.

640
01:04:57,552 --> 01:05:00,971
Because I'm the only one
who survived the injection.

641
01:05:06,060 --> 01:05:09,513
Tell me why I just drew a picture
of me holding her shoe?

642
01:05:22,580 --> 01:05:23,972
Is she okay?

643
01:05:25,674 --> 01:05:28,286
What?
No, you got to be kidding me.

644
01:05:28,287 --> 01:05:30,559
She's dying.
- Your not bringing me into this.

645
01:05:30,560 --> 01:05:32,051
You’re already in it.

646
01:05:32,787 --> 01:05:35,052
We need to know what key unlocks.

647
01:05:35,053 --> 01:05:36,053
Please.

648
01:05:38,509 --> 01:05:41,103
Cassie, how much does
the Chinese know?

649
01:05:41,104 --> 01:05:43,064
Whatever we do, it could be more.

650
01:05:43,065 --> 01:05:44,817
Their watchers
are better than me.

651
01:05:45,137 --> 01:05:47,390
We know there's a suitcase
with a Division drug in it.

652
01:05:47,831 --> 01:05:50,082
Kira hid it somewhere in Hong Kong.
- Can you draw us away out of this?

653
01:05:50,083 --> 01:05:52,267
We can't change anything
without her tracking us

654
01:05:52,268 --> 01:05:53,692
the second we do,
she's gonna see it.

655
01:05:53,693 --> 01:05:54,693
What do you mean?

656
01:05:54,694 --> 01:05:57,216
She sees intensions.
What we decide to do.

657
01:05:57,217 --> 01:05:58,452
I decide to cross the street

658
01:05:58,453 --> 01:06:00,438
so she sees me crossing the street?

659
01:06:00,439 --> 01:06:02,715
What if nothing we did
makes sense?

660
01:06:03,309 --> 01:06:04,829
We just keep changing our minds.

661
01:06:04,830 --> 01:06:07,378
They didn't know exactly
what we're gonna do.

662
01:06:07,379 --> 01:06:08,664
Will that throw it off?

663
01:06:08,665 --> 01:06:11,665
It might be if we start to
find the case.

664
01:06:22,000 --> 01:06:25,000
Whatever this key unlocks
is being shadowed.

665
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:27,001
Like I've never seen before.

666
01:06:28,200 --> 01:06:29,200
It's this way.

667
01:06:34,176 --> 01:06:35,998
That really narrows it down.

668
01:06:40,023 --> 01:06:42,799
If it shadowed,
I won't be able to draw it.

669
01:06:53,539 --> 01:06:55,021
It's the building you see.

670
01:07:01,719 --> 01:07:05,154
I thought shadows weren't suppose
to be affected by watchers like Cassie?

671
01:07:05,155 --> 01:07:06,155
Not.

672
01:07:07,156 --> 01:07:10,989
We're not suppose to able to shade
the entire buildings either.

673
01:07:34,549 --> 01:07:36,551
You wanted to see me?

674
01:07:39,615 --> 01:07:41,467
I'm going to need your help.

675
01:07:45,802 --> 01:07:47,755
Watchers from everywhere
are tracking us.

676
01:07:48,556 --> 01:07:49,855
Carver, the Chinese...

677
01:07:49,856 --> 01:07:51,886
Anything we think, we gonna do,
they know about it.

678
01:07:51,887 --> 01:07:54,606
That's why we all keep dying
in Cassie's book.

679
01:07:54,607 --> 01:07:55,607
Pardon?

680
01:07:55,608 --> 01:07:57,773
You died outside the an elevator.

681
01:08:00,650 --> 01:08:03,133
But how we gonna make
the future unpredictable?

682
01:08:03,473 --> 01:08:05,470
By not knowing what we gonna do...

683
01:08:06,237 --> 01:08:07,808
Until right before we do it.

684
01:08:07,809 --> 01:08:10,932
A plan without a planning.
- Yes, right.

685
01:08:12,634 --> 01:08:16,728
I'll write letters to each of you.
Giving you specific instruction.

686
01:08:16,729 --> 01:08:18,897
You don't open it until
I tell you.

687
01:08:20,964 --> 01:08:24,449
And the last letter
I write to myself...

688
01:08:25,059 --> 01:08:27,091
and wipe the memory I've
ever had written off.

689
01:08:27,092 --> 01:08:30,028
That's why I need you to find
the guy that wipe Kira.

690
01:08:30,356 --> 01:08:33,625
Sure thing.
- That sounds like a great plan.

691
01:08:34,330 --> 01:08:36,854
- Keeping a better one?
- I fine blind.

692
01:08:37,674 --> 01:08:38,926
Yeah.

693
01:08:40,978 --> 01:08:43,992
Cassie, give me one more drawing.

694
01:08:44,553 --> 01:08:47,776
I need to know the exact size
and shape of that case.

695
01:08:47,777 --> 01:08:49,777
And that syringe.

696
01:10:29,899 --> 01:10:34,744
The girl will die unless she receives
the necessary injections.

697
01:10:34,745 --> 01:10:37,568
You’re not going to find the stuff
anywhere but with me.

698
01:10:43,846 --> 01:10:45,628
You die, Nick.

699
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:48,802
You all die.

700
01:11:16,275 --> 01:11:18,758
You need the medicine
that Carver has.

701
01:11:20,700 --> 01:11:22,723
I'm not gonna watch you die.

702
01:11:27,008 --> 01:11:28,760
I'll come back for you.

703
01:11:35,108 --> 01:11:36,619
I promise.

704
01:11:50,436 --> 01:11:51,958
When do I open it?

705
01:11:53,920 --> 01:11:55,963
When you start
to tell the truth.

706
01:12:15,466 --> 01:12:19,015
You know when to open this?
You sure this is right?

707
01:12:19,329 --> 01:12:20,329
No.

708
01:12:27,741 --> 01:12:28,892
Nick.

709
01:12:31,235 --> 01:12:34,859
Take an umbrella,
it's gonna rain.

710
01:12:36,762 --> 01:12:38,814
You be careful too.

711
01:13:03,033 --> 01:13:05,580
You make us chase you
half way across the world

712
01:13:05,581 --> 01:13:08,459
Then you let it had
like Pinky Stein bring you in.

713
01:13:08,460 --> 01:13:11,025
I'm sick.
- You're sick?

714
01:13:11,193 --> 01:13:12,915
You don't know
what you are.

715
01:13:15,248 --> 01:13:16,870
Victor, pay the man.

716
01:13:37,995 --> 01:13:39,287
Of course.

717
01:13:47,096 --> 01:13:50,129
I know I wouldn’t get paid yet.
Wait here.

718
01:13:51,491 --> 01:13:52,730
Are you followed?

719
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:54,731
Never followed.

720
01:13:56,397 --> 01:13:57,810
Where is this guy?

721
01:13:58,300 --> 01:13:59,938
Which one?
- Yellow one.

722
01:13:59,944 --> 01:14:01,943
The big one?
- Yup.

723
01:14:33,622 --> 01:14:34,973
Wu Chang?

724
01:14:38,448 --> 01:14:39,899
Your here about the girl?

725
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:42,150
You're the one that wiped Kira.

726
01:14:42,262 --> 01:14:46,826
Five years ago, a woman told me
an American girl would come.

727
01:14:47,178 --> 01:14:49,331
That was two days ago,
when she show.

728
01:14:51,213 --> 01:14:52,635
I have a job for you.

729
01:14:56,099 --> 01:14:58,561
Two hours ago, I wrote seven letters.

730
01:14:58,562 --> 01:15:00,876
I need you to erase the memory
I've ever having written.

731
01:15:03,197 --> 01:15:06,095
Seven letters,
two hours of memories.

732
01:15:07,452 --> 01:15:09,965
The woman tell me those things.

733
01:15:11,147 --> 01:15:13,089
She did not pay for you, too.

734
01:15:17,715 --> 01:15:20,201
When you’re done,
I need you to open this and read it.

735
01:15:23,982 --> 01:15:26,595
I need a minute.
- As you wish.

736
01:15:34,775 --> 01:15:35,835
Like ah...

737
01:15:36,316 --> 01:15:38,896
Wake up and forget who I am.
Am I?

738
01:16:03,039 --> 01:16:05,793
Wait, wait...
No... Go. Go.

739
01:16:31,684 --> 01:16:33,195
It's all gone.

740
01:16:34,287 --> 01:16:37,526
The future has disappeared.

741
01:16:37,527 --> 01:16:39,527
I lost the connection.

742
01:17:56,800 --> 01:17:59,000
Okay, no problem here.

743
01:18:59,537 --> 01:19:00,537
Thank you.

744
01:19:01,023 --> 01:19:02,535
Red.

745
01:19:05,388 --> 01:19:07,180
Right size, right shape.

746
01:19:07,871 --> 01:19:09,960
No problem.

747
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:12,494
You better hurry.
It won't last long.

748
01:19:27,104 --> 01:19:28,256
4. Hide.

749
01:20:07,162 --> 01:20:08,714
Go home.

750
01:20:32,643 --> 01:20:35,837
Hello.

751
01:20:40,102 --> 01:20:43,914
Did you really think you could
slip out of town with this?

752
01:20:54,070 --> 01:20:57,062
Tell me.
Was this worth dying for?

753
01:21:15,935 --> 01:21:19,551
You die slow.
My sister promised me that...

754
01:21:19,552 --> 01:21:21,875
and the great deal of money.

755
01:21:35,279 --> 01:21:37,383
Do you know how many
people in the world

756
01:21:37,384 --> 01:21:39,384
would kill for this drug?

757
01:21:42,367 --> 01:21:43,728
Now.

758
01:21:50,006 --> 01:21:51,894
Where is Cassie?

759
01:21:55,683 --> 01:21:57,895
Give me back on my feet.

760
01:22:29,153 --> 01:22:31,065
You didn't see that one
coming did you?

761
01:22:31,066 --> 01:22:33,831
Do you really wanna do this
little girl?

762
01:22:33,832 --> 01:22:37,232
I know where the drug is,
more importantly.

763
01:22:37,233 --> 01:22:38,766
I know how you die.

764
01:22:38,767 --> 01:22:41,533
Do you wanna know
what the tiger means?

765
01:22:48,910 --> 01:22:51,478
See if that would
make him love you.

766
01:23:00,651 --> 01:23:02,302
My note says it
suppose to tell you

767
01:23:02,303 --> 01:23:05,303
the Division has Kira,
216 Butan Street

768
01:23:05,837 --> 01:23:09,731
It's said all off on there,
is everyone that complicated?

769
01:23:09,932 --> 01:23:11,414
I know you can handle it.

770
01:23:18,122 --> 01:23:20,380
This immune suppressant
will save your life

771
01:23:20,381 --> 01:23:23,381
and allow you to reach
your full potential.

772
01:23:24,549 --> 01:23:27,221
You are going to be
a better you, Kira.

773
01:23:31,378 --> 01:23:33,590
You need to accept
this reality.

774
01:23:34,852 --> 01:23:37,602
We're not try'n to hurt you, Kira.

775
01:23:37,603 --> 01:23:40,135
You can fight, your will
be means everything to us.

776
01:23:40,810 --> 01:23:43,321
I understand it's not your fault
for forgetting who you are

777
01:23:43,322 --> 01:23:44,317
and running from us.

778
01:23:44,318 --> 01:23:45,939
The drug has side effects.

779
01:23:46,253 --> 01:23:48,940
We have no way of knowing
the severity.

780
01:23:49,169 --> 01:23:51,328
I want you to know
that I blame myself for that.

781
01:23:51,329 --> 01:23:52,329
Agent Hollis.

782
01:24:00,933 --> 01:24:02,615
This isn't real.

783
01:24:12,177 --> 01:24:14,727
You volunteered, Kira.

784
01:24:14,928 --> 01:24:16,728
I was against it.

785
01:24:18,184 --> 01:24:21,577
But you were certain you be
the one to survive the drug.

786
01:24:21,578 --> 01:24:23,177
I had to support you.

787
01:24:23,178 --> 01:24:26,878
After all, we we're partners.

788
01:24:27,379 --> 01:24:29,879
Then you panic.

789
01:24:32,521 --> 01:24:34,226
Do you think you made it
all the way here

790
01:24:34,227 --> 01:24:37,828
and eluded us for so long
without any training?

791
01:24:38,808 --> 01:24:41,672
That's the Division in you, Kira.

792
01:24:42,643 --> 01:24:44,565
Now, let me help you remember.

793
01:24:47,566 --> 01:24:49,566
Now, let me help you remember.

794
01:25:01,000 --> 01:25:04,325
I'm trying to draw
something different, but I can't.

795
01:25:05,871 --> 01:25:07,863
Somebody had to do
how I die.

796
01:25:08,264 --> 01:25:09,515
It is a tiger.

797
01:25:09,986 --> 01:25:11,608
Serious?

798
01:25:12,789 --> 01:25:15,002
I don't know how,
but I just know.

799
01:25:17,155 --> 01:25:18,926
I know I had to act
like I don't care

800
01:25:18,927 --> 01:25:20,324
Sometimes...

801
01:25:21,249 --> 01:25:23,654
I don't wanna die.
- Cassie.

802
01:25:27,917 --> 01:25:29,439
That's not gonna happen,
okay?

803
01:25:30,751 --> 01:25:32,139
Just tell me that
I'm a crappy artist

804
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:33,263
and I'm wrong.

805
01:25:33,264 --> 01:25:36,528
You are a crappy artist
and you are wrong.

806
01:25:36,908 --> 01:25:37,661
Listen to me.

807
01:25:38,962 --> 01:25:41,783
You already done more than
enough for everyone.

808
01:25:41,784 --> 01:25:43,733
The only thing you gotta worry
about right now is

809
01:25:43,734 --> 01:25:45,668
keeping yourself safe.

810
01:25:45,669 --> 01:25:47,131
But how?

811
01:25:47,761 --> 01:25:48,871
You just start walking,

812
01:25:48,872 --> 01:25:50,183
don't even think about
where you're going...

813
01:25:50,184 --> 01:25:52,137
You just keep on moving
don't make any decision

814
01:25:52,138 --> 01:25:53,655
any watcher can track.

815
01:25:54,309 --> 01:25:56,367
You come across
some place safe...

816
01:25:56,768 --> 01:25:57,820
You hide.

817
01:25:58,369 --> 01:26:00,106
Simple as that.

818
01:26:00,356 --> 01:26:02,638
I don't know how, but I know
this is gonna work out.

819
01:26:02,639 --> 01:26:03,599
Promise.

820
01:26:03,600 --> 01:26:06,370
No need to be scared.
Trust me.

821
01:26:07,875 --> 01:26:09,567
It's more like it.

822
01:26:29,461 --> 01:26:30,813
What you gonna do?

823
01:26:33,766 --> 01:26:35,158
I can't tell you.

824
01:29:29,938 --> 01:29:33,241
You made me look like a fool
in front of my family.

825
01:29:39,419 --> 01:29:40,901
Don't worry.

826
01:29:48,731 --> 01:29:50,673
You won't remember a thing.

827
01:29:53,577 --> 01:29:55,989
Your mother is very proud.

828
01:30:07,653 --> 01:30:09,276
I wanna make a deal,

829
01:30:09,277 --> 01:30:11,277
the drug for the girl.

830
01:30:13,691 --> 01:30:14,972
Okay.

831
01:30:16,504 --> 01:30:18,892
Top floor, Mandarin street.

832
01:30:34,446 --> 01:30:37,598
Where's the case, Nick?
- Kira.

833
01:30:43,226 --> 01:30:45,088
Go ahead.

834
01:30:47,471 --> 01:30:50,395
Remember that night
under the roller coaster?

835
01:30:52,000 --> 01:30:54,954
We parked in the rain and
got this little bottles of jack

836
01:31:02,299 --> 01:31:05,453
That's the first time
you told me you loved me.

837
01:31:08,100 --> 01:31:10,158
He remembers.

838
01:31:12,121 --> 01:31:14,313
I wanna hear from him.

839
01:31:16,486 --> 01:31:18,008
I remember.

840
01:31:20,891 --> 01:31:22,543
Never happened.

841
01:31:25,427 --> 01:31:28,010
We met for the first time
yesterday.

842
01:31:29,371 --> 01:31:31,854
You've never been
to Coney Island.

843
01:31:33,246 --> 01:31:35,499
Nobody has been
to Coney Island.

844
01:31:38,222 --> 01:31:40,475
I used Nick.

845
01:31:42,077 --> 01:31:45,671
The quick we find that case,
the quick I let you forget it.

846
01:31:49,576 --> 01:31:51,528
You might get wrong.

847
01:31:55,903 --> 01:31:58,586
My card says
you have to take the drug.

848
01:31:58,587 --> 01:31:59,927
Give me Carver.

849
01:31:59,928 --> 01:32:01,180
Is for you.

850
01:32:08,699 --> 01:32:09,910
Hello.

851
01:32:09,911 --> 01:32:12,943
You want the case?
You let them loose.

852
01:32:12,944 --> 01:32:15,312
I'll tell you exactly where it is.

853
01:32:20,313 --> 01:32:21,925
Another?
- Sure.

854
01:32:26,410 --> 01:32:28,092
One for the road.

855
01:33:19,133 --> 01:33:20,538
Don't feel too bad...

856
01:33:21,265 --> 01:33:24,539
That push of Kira's
has worked on better man.

857
01:34:40,431 --> 01:34:42,013
Kill him.

858
01:34:44,065 --> 01:34:45,827
What's wrong with you?

859
01:34:47,079 --> 01:34:48,661
The case!

860
01:34:56,690 --> 01:34:58,843
Agent Carver.

861
01:35:07,944 --> 01:35:10,007
The contents of this case
are the property

862
01:35:10,008 --> 01:35:11,347
of the U.S. government.

863
01:35:11,348 --> 01:35:12,500
Government?

864
01:35:12,501 --> 01:35:14,335
We are the only
the government here.

865
01:35:14,336 --> 01:35:15,585
Be reasonable.

866
01:35:15,586 --> 01:35:18,195
There's no need
for anyone to die.

867
01:35:20,259 --> 01:35:22,811
There's not much for
diplomacy these days.

868
01:35:32,512 --> 01:35:35,812
Victor!
Make the way out of here!

869
01:35:50,645 --> 01:35:52,157
Kill him.

870
01:37:27,792 --> 01:37:28,873
Kira!

871
01:37:49,568 --> 01:37:50,749
Kira?

872
01:39:15,950 --> 01:39:17,750
Die!

873
01:40:30,000 --> 01:40:31,572
Oh!

874
01:40:31,573 --> 01:40:33,285
I'm impressed!

875
01:40:33,286 --> 01:40:36,435
We engineers are always
conservative with the projections.

876
01:40:36,436 --> 01:40:37,369
This is something else.

877
01:40:37,370 --> 01:40:38,481
Hey!

878
01:40:38,482 --> 01:40:40,673
We're on the same side,
remember?

879
01:40:40,674 --> 01:40:42,836
Why don't you march
the men who tried to kill us.

880
01:40:42,837 --> 01:40:45,013
Off this roof
and we'd call it a day.

881
01:40:46,100 --> 01:40:48,192
Wait, Kira, don't do this.

882
01:40:49,584 --> 01:40:50,584
It's a push.

883
01:40:51,018 --> 01:40:52,379
What Carver told you is a lie.

884
01:40:52,380 --> 01:40:54,580
Sure, you made
a card for this.

885
01:40:59,000 --> 01:41:00,804
Where we were.

886
01:41:01,418 --> 01:41:03,811
Where we were!

887
01:41:24,837 --> 01:41:26,458
You don't wanna do that.

888
01:41:27,309 --> 01:41:28,180
Watch me.

889
01:41:28,381 --> 01:41:30,492
You'd be doing me a favor,
if your dead.

890
01:41:30,493 --> 01:41:32,293
What's in that needle will kill you.

891
01:41:32,294 --> 01:41:35,294
I went to hundreds of
potentials to find her.

892
01:41:35,529 --> 01:41:37,426
She our survivor.

893
01:41:40,956 --> 01:41:42,407
Look at me.

894
01:41:47,113 --> 01:41:48,465
You know me.

895
01:41:51,298 --> 01:41:53,050
I know you.

896
01:41:58,000 --> 01:41:59,778
Look at me.

897
01:42:01,200 --> 01:42:02,792
Look at me.

898
01:42:09,680 --> 01:42:13,264
Let him do it.

899
01:43:00,762 --> 01:43:02,313
What a waste.

900
01:43:41,030 --> 01:43:43,423
I told you to bring an umbrella.

901
01:43:47,568 --> 01:43:49,593
I thought you said
it was gonna rain.

902
01:43:49,594 --> 01:43:52,594
I also told you, I get
things wrong sometimes.

903
01:43:58,411 --> 01:44:00,910
Maybe they wash
the crap out of your hair.

904
01:44:07,011 --> 01:44:08,833
So where's the real case?

905
01:44:22,440 --> 01:44:23,761
There it is.

906
01:44:25,633 --> 01:44:29,836
How long do you think your
mother has been planning this?

907
01:44:31,481 --> 01:44:33,723
Just before I was born.

908
01:44:36,496 --> 01:44:38,799
This is the key, Nick.
The Division would do anything

909
01:44:38,800 --> 01:44:40,713
to keep this from getting
to the wrong hands.

910
01:44:41,863 --> 01:44:43,985
So you trade your mom
for the drug?

911
01:44:45,177 --> 01:44:47,099
I'm still workin' on that.

912
01:44:50,924 --> 01:44:53,487
Hey, what was that I injected
myself with?

913
01:44:53,537 --> 01:44:56,030
A known dragon
soy sauce.

914
01:44:57,031 --> 01:44:58,653
That's gross.

915
01:44:59,555 --> 01:45:01,135
What about Kira?

916
01:45:01,136 --> 01:45:03,689
You’re the watcher.
You tell me?

917
01:45:03,898 --> 01:45:06,721
Do not worry, we'll see
miss trouble soon enough.

918
01:45:40,000 --> 01:45:41,148
When do I open it?

919
01:45:41,200 --> 01:45:43,638
When you start to tell the truth.

920
01:45:53,088 --> 01:45:56,643
KILL HIM.
SEE YOU SOON, NICK.

921
01:46:23,000 --> 01:46:25,821
Put your gun
in your mouth.

922
01:46:27,520 --> 01:46:29,472
Pull the trigger.
