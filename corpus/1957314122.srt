00:47:37,987 --> 00:47:41,291
Let's say I can. Why should I?

1051
00:47:41,324 --> 00:47:43,026
Pay back some of the
morality debt

1052
00:47:43,059 --> 00:47:44,894
Grandpa Klan up there's
racked up.

1053
00:47:44,927 --> 00:47:45,728
Is he always that funny?

1054
00:47:45,762 --> 00:47:47,631
You always speak with
that accent?

1055
00:47:47,664 --> 00:47:51,268
What accent?
You guys any good?

1056
00:47:51,300 --> 00:47:54,170
Regional finals until
Monk screwed us over.

1057
00:47:54,202 --> 00:47:54,971
Monk?

1058
00:47:55,003 --> 00:47:59,175
Yeah, Monk. Took our
best player.

1059
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:04,179
Alright. I'll help
you get in on one condition.

1060
00:48:04,213 --> 00:48:05,315
I play on your team.

1061
00:48:05,347 --> 00:48:06,516
No.

1062
00:48:06,548 --> 00:48:09,552
C'mon Fritz. We need
a fifth player anyway.

1063
00:48:09,985 --> 00:48:10,753
Can you play?

1064
00:48:10,786 --> 00:48:12,321
You just worry about
yourselves.

1065
00:48:12,355 --> 00:48:14,990
Alright, hotshot,
let's say you're in.

1066
00:48:15,023 --> 00:48:16,558
How do we get into the
tournament?

1067
00:48:16,592 --> 00:48:19,996
We get an invitation
from the commissioner.

1068
00:48:20,028 --> 00:48:20,829
Why didn't I think of that?

1069
00:48:20,862 --> 00:48:22,565
You know, let's call
him right now.

1070
00:48:22,597 --> 00:48:24,166
Hey, Commish, how's it hanging?

1071
00:48:24,199 --> 00:48:26,502
Can we get an invite
to the league championship?

1072
00:48:26,536 --> 00:48:28,070
- What did he say?
- Oh yeah, good call.

1073
00:48:28,103 --> 00:48:29,105
He's going to get right on that.

1074
00:48:29,139 --> 00:48:31,074
- Didn't say we ask for it.
- So, what do we do?

1075
00:48:31,106 --> 00:48:31,875
We win it.

1076
00:48:31,907 --> 00:48:35,144
Uh, newsflash, regionals
are over.

1077
00:48:35,177 --> 00:48:36,645
Kind of why we're here
in the first place.

1078
00:48:36,679 --> 00:48:38,949
Come on, Hollywood,
we're wasting our time.

1079
00:48:38,981 --> 00:48:41,550
We win it at the URL.

1080
00:48:41,583 --> 00:48:42,652
What'd you say?

1081
00:48:42,684 --> 00:48:46,389
You heard me. We win
it at the URL.

1082
00:48:46,422 --> 00:48:48,358
Fritz, what's a URL?

1083
00:48:48,391 --> 00:48:50,626
A figment of his imagination.
That's what it is.

1084
00:48:50,659 --> 00:48:52,494
You sure about that?

1085
00:48:52,527 --> 00:48:54,496
Yeah.

1086
00:48:54,530 --> 00:48:56,666
Well, I've got five
broken bones and

1087
00:48:56,699 --> 00:48:59,302
three skin grafts to
suggest otherwise.

1088

Wait a second, I know who you
are. You're Logan Carter.

1089

FRITZ:
Underground RPS League.

1092
00:49:17,420 --> 00:49:19,255
They supposedly ran
a no-holds-barred tournament

1093
00:49:19,288 --> 00:49:22,492
unsanctioned by Rock Paper
Scissors Association of America.

1094
00:49:22,525 --> 00:49:23,994
I just thought it was a myth.

1095
00:49:24,027 --> 00:49:25,662
It's no myth.
The RPS commissioner

1096
00:49:25,695 --> 00:49:27,664
has a hard on for full
contact.

1097
00:49:27,697 --> 00:49:28,999
He can't sanction the league

1098
00:49:29,032 --> 00:49:29,967
but doesn't mean
he can't extend

1099
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,001
an invitation to the
winners under the table.

1100
00:49:32,034 --> 00:49:33,069
Fritz, how do you
know this guy?

1101
00:49:33,103 --> 00:49:35,005
Logan Carter was an up and
comer in then RPS ranks.

1102
00:49:35,038 --> 00:49:36,338
Had a lot of potential.

1103
00:49:36,371 --> 00:49:38,340
I heard Monk tried to
recruit him.

1104
00:49:38,373 --> 00:49:41,043
Recruit me? That's a joke.

1105
00:49:41,077 --> 00:49:43,546
First thing he did was
send me into the URL.

1106
00:49:43,579 --> 00:49:46,016
Said I needed to toughen up.

1107
00:49:46,048 --> 00:49:48,351
That's one hell of a
way to cut your teeth.

1108
00:49:48,384 --> 00:49:49,619
Always knew he was scared.

1109
00:49:49,652 --> 00:49:51,086
Scared of what?

1110
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:52,054
Of me.

1111
00:49:52,088 --> 00:49:53,757
Now you're delusional.
Monk wouldn't be afraid

1112
00:49:53,789 --> 00:49:55,557
of some punk beating
him.

1113
00:49:55,590 --> 00:49:57,594
What if that punk already had?

1114
00:49:57,626 --> 00:49:58,695

happened to you?

that he'd be here.

Hello Link. It's been a
long time.

Not long enough. I
thought I was clear.

I wasn't to see your
face around here anymore.

time I seen my face it

00:51:39,561 --> 00:51:42,531
you should give him,
a call. I'll make this

ticket to the big dance.

I need you to give it to me.

1141
00:51:46,835 --> 00:51:48,670
And why would I do that?

1142
00:51:48,704 --> 00:51:51,474
Because I know it eats you up
inside knowing that besides

1143
00:51:51,507 --> 00:51:56,146
Monk - I am the one person
you can't beat.

So, I'm giving you the
chance to reconcile.

us to the fucking dogs!

Alright, as I was saying,
contrary to what you probably

1172
00:53:14,856 --> 00:53:18,628
heard, RPS is not a game
mastered by chance, habits

1173

to control the fear.

there's nothing left to do.

1192
00:53:53,628 --> 00:53:55,731
so you're throwing rock.
If your pulse pulses

1193
00:53:55,764 --> 00:53:58,701
just before the moment
of impact, you're unsure

1194
00:53:58,733 --> 00:54:01,336
and most likely throwing
paper.

1195
00:54:01,369 --> 00:54:03,739
Now, if your pulse spikes,
you're being aggressive

1196
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:05,807
and throwing scissors. But I
wouldn't know any of

1197
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:08,677
this if I can't
see your pulse. Your neck

all, give you a way. So calm

01:13:40,547 --> 01:13:41,949
[laughter]

1562
01:13:41,983 --> 01:13:44,985
I'm being serious.

1563
01:13:45,019 --> 01:13:47,722
I can't believe I'm going
to say this.

1564
01:13:47,755 --> 01:13:51,626
If we make it to the finals,
you're our anchor. You got Monk.

1565
01:13:51,658 --> 01:13:54,829
Logan, You've been in this the
whole time just to beat Monk.

1566
01:13:54,863 --> 01:13:56,865
Don't you think I know that.
Don't you think I'd love to

1567
01:13:56,898 --> 01:13:59,801
defeat that arrogant prick.

1568
01:13:59,833 --> 01:14:04,005
But the fact is he knows
me, knows how too beat me.

1569
01:14:04,037 --> 01:14:06,240
He's counting on facing
me in the finals.

1570
01:14:06,274 --> 01:14:09,010
But, he's never faced
him, doesn't know him.

1571
01:14:09,042 --> 01:14:12,480
And let's face it. Anyone who
throws paper six times

1572
01:14:12,514 --> 01:14:15,484
in a row and wins might
actually scare him.

1573
01:14:15,516 --> 01:14:17,219
But what's to stop him from
just playing you

1574
01:14:17,252 --> 01:14:19,020
when you step up to the table?

1575
01:14:19,052 --> 01:14:22,189
He can't. For the finals you
have to submit your team roster

1576
01:14:22,222 --> 01:14:24,826
in the order they play
before the match begins

1577
01:14:24,859 --> 01:14:27,028
that way you can't jockey around
players trying to gain

1578
01:14:27,060 --> 01:14:28,563
an advantage.

1579
01:14:28,595 --> 01:14:32,233
That's right. I'll tell you
what. If I know Monk,

1580
01:14:32,266 --> 01:14:36,204
it's really going to piss him
off. Now get some sleep.

1581
01:14:40,975 --> 01:14:42,778
[somber music]

1582
01:14:46,046 --> 01:14:47,581
Don't worry about it.

1583
01:14:47,614 --> 01:14:49,583
You did a great
job out there today.

1584
01:14:49,617 --> 01:14:50,886
Didn't lose a set.

1585
01:14:50,918 --> 01:14:51,920
I had a good teacher.

1586
01:14:51,953 --> 01:14:54,957
Fucking right you did.

1587
01:14:58,960 --> 01:15:00,828
Listen Kel,
I never did thank you for

1588
01:15:00,862 --> 01:15:04,132
getting us this far. You know,
for getting us here.

1589
01:15:04,164 --> 01:15:08,302
I've been picked on my entire
life, my entire life. I've been

1590
01:15:08,336 --> 01:15:12,774
the dumb kid, fat kid, the
useless fuck

1591
01:15:12,806 --> 01:15:15,076
at the end of the bench.

1592
01:15:15,109 --> 01:15:17,679
I never had anyone pull
through for me before like

1593
01:15:17,712 --> 01:15:20,615
you have. So thanks.

1594
01:15:20,648 --> 01:15:22,851
You're a great friend, Fritz.

1595
01:15:22,884 --> 01:15:25,287
You looked out for Cheddar.
You looked out for Rerun

1596
01:15:25,319 --> 01:15:27,255
You looked out for me.

1597
01:15:27,287 --> 01:15:28,889
I guess we make a pretty
good team, huh?

1598
01:15:28,922 --> 01:15:29,890
Yeah.

1599
01:15:29,923 --> 01:15:33,595
[laughs]

1600
01:15:33,860 --> 01:15:36,197
You really think we
can win tomorrow?

1601
01:15:36,229 --> 01:15:38,198
Don't know

1602
01:15:38,231 --> 01:15:40,100
Monk's team is pretty
solid and of course they

1603
01:15:40,134 --> 01:15:43,203
have Einstein so I don't
even think Logan

1604
01:15:43,237 --> 01:15:45,806
has a chance there.

1605
01:15:45,840 --> 01:15:48,043
What about Monk?

1606
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:49,043
[bang]

1607
01:15:49,077 --> 01:15:50,110
Ow!

1608
01:15:50,144 --> 01:15:52,814
Son of a bitch Jordan
what the fuck?

1609
01:15:52,846 --> 01:15:57,184
Anus? Miss me? Think I was
going to let you piss in my

1610
01:15:57,984 --> 01:16:00,988
car, take my girl and walk away
into the fucking sunset huh?

1611
01:16:01,021 --> 01:16:02,791
Yeah, that was kind
of the plan.

1612
01:16:02,823 --> 01:16:05,125
Well, there's a new plan
asshole. And it involves

1613
01:16:05,158 --> 01:16:07,728
using your mouth like
you did my car seat.

1614
01:16:07,761 --> 01:16:10,831
Let him go, dickhead.

1615
01:16:10,864 --> 01:16:12,367
Oh shit.

1616
01:16:12,399 --> 01:16:14,001
I fucking hate that kid.

1617
01:16:14,034 --> 01:16:16,203
Seriously, all the guardian
angels in the world and I

1618
01:16:16,237 --> 01:16:19,740
get the janitor?

1619
01:16:21,643 --> 01:16:24,145
Was that our fucking janitor?

1620
01:16:24,177 --> 01:16:27,082
I think that was. Fuck, dude,
how's your hand?

1621
01:16:27,114 --> 01:16:30,985
Fucking kills. You
mother fucking asshole!

1622
01:16:33,887 --> 01:16:36,256
We're screwed. We're
screwed. We're screwed.

1623
01:16:36,289 --> 01:16:39,094
[screams]

1624
01:16:40,395 --> 01:16:42,197
[evil music]

1625
01:16:52,206 --> 01:16:54,976
Good afternoon sports
fans and welcome back.

1626
01:16:55,009 --> 01:16:58,712
Well, this is it. The final
day, the coupe de gras.

1627
01:16:58,746 --> 01:17:03,184
Four teams remain, but soon, it
will be down to two.

1628
01:17:03,216 --> 01:17:06,387
In pool A we have last year's
runner up, Sonic Doom

1629
01:17:06,421 --> 01:17:09,423
against last year's
champ, Team Nemesis.

1630
01:17:09,457 --> 01:17:13,828
And in pool B it's the Flying
Fuks squaring off against

1631
01:17:13,860 --> 01:17:17,297
this year's Cinderella
story The BuckFutters.

1632
01:17:17,331 --> 01:17:21,735
Bu if the BuckFutters are to
remain and continue on,

1633
01:17:21,769 --> 01:17:23,872
they're going to have
to overcome a few more obstacles

1634
01:17:23,904 --> 01:17:28,042
as we have just learned
Fritz Flaherty has sustained

1635
01:17:28,076 --> 01:17:30,744
an injury to his right hand
for further news on this

1636
01:17:30,778 --> 01:17:33,748
let's throw it over to Jelly
Kane, Jelly.

1637
01:17:33,780 --> 01:17:38,219
Thank you Case. Fritz Flowerty
is hurt very bad and it

1638
01:17:38,252 --> 01:17:42,090
will be difficult for him to
play with this hand. However,

1639
01:17:42,122 --> 01:17:46,260
he will be able to play with
this hand. As you know that

1640
01:17:47,060 --> 01:17:52,232
is a near impossibility in this
sport back to you Case.

1641
01:17:52,265 --> 01:17:56,236
Well, thank you Jelly. The stage
is set and the stakes are high.

1642
01:17:56,270 --> 01:18:00,108
So grab a seat folks and settle
in because tonight

1643
01:18:00,140 --> 01:18:02,242
promises to be a barn burner.

1644
01:18:02,275 --> 01:18:04,445
[foot stomping]

1645
01:18:04,479 --> 01:18:06,847
Jesus Christ! You
can barely move it.

1646
01:18:06,881 --> 01:18:08,249
How are you going to
compete with that?

1647
01:18:08,282 --> 01:18:11,953
I don't know, but
we're not forfeiting.

1648
01:18:11,985 --> 01:18:15,256
God damn right we're
not forfeiting. Fuck.

1649
01:18:15,288 --> 01:18:18,059
We're not going to win either.
Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck,

1650
01:18:18,091 --> 01:18:20,327
Fuck!

1651
01:18:20,360 --> 01:18:23,698
Fuck!

1652
01:18:26,100 --> 01:18:29,471
Come on. Let's get
this over with. Fuck!

1653
01:18:32,806 --> 01:18:34,408
[people screams]

1654
01:18:36,911 --> 01:18:39,715
[up tempo music]

1655
01:18:42,783 --> 01:18:46,220
Players ready.

1656
01:18:46,887 --> 01:18:50,125
Engage.

1657
01:18:52,326 --> 01:18:55,395
Scissorella takes the first set,
and the Monk is simply

1658
01:18:55,429 --> 01:18:58,833
beside himself. As Nemesis finds
themselves down for the

1659
01:18:58,865 --> 01:19:02,103
first time in the tournament. So
sit tight and hook up those

1660
01:19:02,136 --> 01:19:05,140
colostomy bags sports fans
cause here we go.

1661
01:19:06,106 --> 01:19:09,144
Engage.

1662
01:19:10,877 --> 01:19:13,380
Look at this freak of nature
tear his opponent apart

1663
01:19:13,413 --> 01:19:15,849
as he stays unbeaten and brings
Nemesis from the brink

1664
01:19:15,882 --> 01:19:20,188
of elimination.

1665
01:19:20,488 --> 01:19:22,524
And Dread ties it up!

1666
01:19:22,556 --> 01:19:24,992
Leaving their fate in
the hands of the one

1667
01:19:25,025 --> 01:19:27,961
and only monk.

1668
01:19:27,994 --> 01:19:28,996
Winner.

1669
01:19:29,029 --> 01:19:31,198
He wins it again folks and
this underdog crowd

1670
01:19:31,231 --> 01:19:35,403
here, does not look happy.

1671
01:19:47,381 --> 01:19:50,051
It was him. He brought
Jordan here.

1672
01:19:50,083 --> 01:19:52,353
That bald fuck busted my hand!

1673
01:19:52,386 --> 01:19:56,391
[music]

1674
01:19:56,423 --> 01:19:57,891
Winner.

1675
01:19:57,925 --> 01:20:02,163
[people cheering]

1676
01:20:05,932 --> 01:20:09,069
It doesn't look good folks after
a terrific start by Logan

1677
01:20:09,103 --> 01:20:12,073
Carter the BuckFutters are in a
hole that keeps getting bigger

1678
01:20:12,105 --> 01:20:15,309
as the three-fingered assassin
is shredding through the one

1679
01:20:15,342 --> 01:20:18,246
handed Flaherty. Is it paper?
Is it scissors?

1680
01:20:18,279 --> 01:20:19,848
I have no idea.

1681
01:20:19,881 --> 01:20:21,382
Winner.

1682
01:20:21,414 --> 01:20:23,217
Oh, and apparently,
neither does Flaherty

1683
01:20:23,251 --> 01:20:25,453
as the BuckFutters find
themselves, once again,

1684
01:20:25,485 --> 01:20:28,555
on the edge of elimination
with the rookie sensation

1685
01:20:28,588 --> 01:20:30,925
and weakest link still to go.

1686
01:20:30,957 --> 01:20:33,161
No way. Kelvin, you're next.

1687
01:20:33,194 --> 01:20:34,395
I thought you wanted me to
the anchor?

1688
01:20:34,427 --> 01:20:36,331
Yes, but that was until it was
down two to one.

1689
01:20:36,363 --> 01:20:38,599
We lose, we go home and there's
nothing for you to fucking

1690
01:20:38,632 --> 01:20:41,269
anchor then, is there?
Hence, you're up.

1691
01:20:41,301 --> 01:20:42,402
I can't go last.

1692
01:20:42,436 --> 01:20:44,471
And I can't give myself a decent
blowjob but that doesn't

1693
01:20:44,505 --> 01:20:46,074
stop me from
trying now, does it?

1694
01:20:46,106 --> 01:20:47,074
God, I hope so.

1695
01:20:47,108 --> 01:20:49,476
Look, you just worry about
winning right now

1696
01:20:49,510 --> 01:20:52,413
And you get ready for when he
wins. Now come on get

1697
01:20:52,445 --> 01:20:54,414
in there. Let's do it. Come on,

1698
01:20:54,448 --> 01:20:56,951
Come on.

1699
01:20:56,984 --> 01:21:00,121
Players ready.

1700
01:21:00,154 --> 01:21:02,223
Engage.

1701
01:21:02,256 --> 01:21:03,224
Scissors.

1702
01:21:03,256 --> 01:21:04,224
Engage.

1703
01:21:04,257 --> 01:21:05,225
Win.

1704
01:21:05,259 --> 01:21:07,095
Engage.

1705
01:21:07,127 --> 01:21:09,162
Paper.

1706
01:21:09,195 --> 01:21:11,298
[people cheering]

1707
01:21:11,332 --> 01:21:13,434
Rerun it's all up to you now,
ok. We take this and

1708
01:21:13,466 --> 01:21:14,501
we're in the finals. You got it?

1709
01:21:14,534 --> 01:21:15,368
I can't do this.

1710
01:21:15,403 --> 01:21:18,106
Pull it together. Gotta
do this. Okay

1711
01:21:18,139 --> 01:21:20,240
I can't, you guys. I can't.

1712
01:21:20,274 --> 01:21:21,409
Well hold on folks.

1713
01:21:21,442 --> 01:21:24,578
There seems to be something
wrong with the BuckFutters

1714
01:21:24,612 --> 01:21:28,983
last player. Seems that
the infamous pressure of

1715
01:21:29,015 --> 01:21:32,252
the RPS semi-final has taken
yet another victim.

1716
01:21:32,286 --> 01:21:33,520
He can't even move.

1717
01:21:33,554 --> 01:21:34,489
Then we fuckin' carry
him there.

1718
01:21:34,521 --> 01:21:36,323
We put him up there
like this, it's over.

1719
01:21:36,356 --> 01:21:38,326
Well, we got to do something.

1720
01:21:38,359 --> 01:21:41,930
Come on, ideas.

1721
01:21:41,962 --> 01:21:43,264
Kelvin.

1722
01:21:43,296 --> 01:21:47,067
Come on. Come on.

1723
01:21:49,069 --> 01:21:54,041
Rerun. Rerun. Rerun.
Rerun.

1724
01:21:54,074 --> 01:21:57,377

Rerun.

Rerun. Rerun. Rerun.
Rerun.

1726
01:22:01,414 --> 01:22:05,452
Rerun. Rerun. Rerun.
Rerun.

1727
01:22:10,658 --> 01:22:14,663
Rerun. Rerun. Rerun.
Rerun.

1728
01:22:16,529 --> 01:22:21,302
[crowd keeps chanting]

1729
01:22:22,269 --> 01:22:23,237
You hear that?

1730
01:22:23,270 --> 01:22:24,405

Well I've got to tell you folks,

1753
01:23:03,243 --> 01:23:06,079
in all my years

see David face the mighty
Goliath, then don't move

1757
01:23:17,257 --> 01:23:21,095

moments perhaps the greatest

say, all of the world is about

01:24:26,726 --> 01:24:31,398
can for you. If it gets
that far. [laughs]

He's
supposed to be the anchor.

1778
01:24:58,259 --> 01:25:00,261
I said I'd see you
in the ring, Monk.

1779
01:25:00,293 --> 01:25:02,329
Never said anything
about playing you, mate.

1780
01:25:02,363 --> 01:25:04,565
I'm sorry Mr. Monk, but my
list has Logan Carter

1781
01:25:04,597 --> 01:25:06,199
as the BuckFutters'
lead off man.

1782
01:25:06,233 --> 01:25:07,502
No he's supposed to play me!

1783
01:25:07,534 --> 01:25:09,436
Mr. Monk, my list says
otherwise. Now step back.

1784
01:25:09,470 --> 01:25:13,240
Walk away. Move on. Bye bye.

Round one goes to
the BuckFutters.

And just like that the ghost of
RPS past flies in

1795
01:25:37,898 --> 01:25:42,737

away with a crushing blow.
