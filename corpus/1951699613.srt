1
00:00:56,523 --> 00:00:58,081
Who are you?

2
00:01:05,765 --> 00:01:06,754
Marina!

3
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:11,398
Go, go, go!

4
00:01:18,178 --> 00:01:19,702
Mama!

5
00:01:22,849 --> 00:01:24,009
Call the police!

6
00:01:45,271 --> 00:01:47,330
- Here ya go, champ.
- Thanks.

7
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:50,969
You're blockin' my view.

8
00:01:58,051 --> 00:02:00,952
- Peanut?
- It's time you made a change.

9
00:02:01,054 --> 00:02:03,887
My suggestion is
go someplace warm,

10
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:05,116
get outta the heat.

11
00:02:06,259 --> 00:02:07,658
That the suggestion?

12
00:02:07,760 --> 00:02:10,024
Okay, it's not a suggestion.

13
00:02:13,166 --> 00:02:15,327
Since you put it that way,
how long do I got?

14
00:02:15,435 --> 00:02:18,370
No rush. Finish your drink.

15
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:48,254
- Hey, Enrique.
- Chris, how are you?

16
00:03:48,361 --> 00:03:50,454
- Carlos.
- Hey, Chris, what's up?

17
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:52,258
I got you guys set up
right back here.

18
00:03:53,733 --> 00:03:55,997
Here you go. VIP.
Anything you need, let me know.

19
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:57,831
You guys have a good time, okay?

20
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:05,243
Anything these guys want...

21
00:04:08,948 --> 00:04:10,438
Got it.

22
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:11,710
Okay.

23
00:04:39,879 --> 00:04:40,937
Manny!

24
00:04:51,758 --> 00:04:53,316
Hey, you got any peanuts tonight?

25
00:04:53,426 --> 00:04:55,792
Andy, you know the boss
don't like peanuts.

26
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:57,487
Why not?

27
00:04:57,597 --> 00:04:59,189
They don't have any class.

28
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,266
Oh, boy.

29
00:05:01,301 --> 00:05:02,563
I like 'em.

30
00:05:04,704 --> 00:05:06,934
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

31
00:05:08,274 --> 00:05:09,571
Tell me somethin'.

32
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,769
What's a guy gotta do
to get a job around here?

33
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,079
Try tipping the bartender.

34
00:05:16,416 --> 00:05:17,644
Come on. I'm serious.

35
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:21,082
Sometimes they need people
at the door.

36
00:05:21,187 --> 00:05:22,654
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

37
00:05:36,436 --> 00:05:38,097
Excuse me, ladies.

38
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:40,439
Come on.

39
00:05:46,212 --> 00:05:48,077
Okay, okay. No more in the club.

40
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,409
Sit down.

41
00:05:49,515 --> 00:05:51,107
That's not good enough.

42
00:05:51,718 --> 00:05:53,709
<i>Sometimes I think
you're such a prude.</i>

43
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:54,912
You know what?

44
00:05:55,021 --> 00:05:57,922
You're no good to me
with your nose full, all right?

45
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:00,993
Plus, I promised your father.
You're my business partner.

46
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,085
People come here to party.

47
00:06:03,196 --> 00:06:06,222
I don't need you to tell me
why people come here.

48
00:06:07,467 --> 00:06:10,595
Okay? I don't need trouble.
Trouble costs me money.

49
00:06:10,703 --> 00:06:12,728
- Do you understand?
- Yes.

50
00:06:21,848 --> 00:06:24,544
We're gonna have to start
stacking 'em on top of each other

51
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:25,878
if we don't get any bigger.

52
00:06:25,985 --> 00:06:26,952
All right.

53
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:34,721
Bigger.

54
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,800
I know, sweetheart...
the coke ain't yours.

55
00:07:55,908 --> 00:07:57,239
Keep your hands on the car.

56
00:07:57,343 --> 00:07:59,004
Tango Six, we're on scene.

57
00:08:01,747 --> 00:08:03,078
Let me see your I.D.

58
00:08:06,686 --> 00:08:08,847
You're a big girl,
you know this is possession.

59
00:08:22,702 --> 00:08:24,693
That lieutenant needs
to catch a beatin'.

60
00:08:24,804 --> 00:08:27,637
No, do that and even my father
couldn't save us.

61
00:08:30,176 --> 00:08:31,768
- Good evenin', Mr. Troiano.
- Andy.

62
00:09:42,281 --> 00:09:43,248
Enrique.

63
00:09:46,285 --> 00:09:48,412
- Hey, you look great, man.
- Yeah, you too.

64
00:10:00,199 --> 00:10:03,828
Donatella.
You look fabulous tonight.

65
00:10:05,037 --> 00:10:06,470
<i>Chris, mi amigo.</i>

66
00:10:06,572 --> 00:10:09,507
Signor Versace, you don't look
half bad yourself.

67
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:11,008
Welcome to Liquid.

68
00:10:13,045 --> 00:10:14,273
How we doin' tonight?

69
00:10:14,380 --> 00:10:16,177
we'd do better if we raised the cover.

70
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:18,250
Well, let's not get greedy.

71
00:10:19,285 --> 00:10:20,843
Just an idea. You're the boss.

72
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,444
We want to keep the money
coming in, not going out.

73
00:10:27,727 --> 00:10:29,592
Chris, look. It's so cool.

74
00:10:29,695 --> 00:10:31,663
What is this?

75
00:10:31,764 --> 00:10:33,129
It's called publicity.

76
00:10:33,232 --> 00:10:34,961
People come here to see celebrities

77
00:10:35,067 --> 00:10:37,592
and bitchy socialites like you, not me.

78
00:10:37,703 --> 00:10:40,831
It's all about South Beach
six months after we opened up Liquid...

79
00:10:40,940 --> 00:10:43,500
building boom, real estate boom,
tourism boom.

80
00:10:43,609 --> 00:10:45,099
Honey, in this town...

81
00:10:45,711 --> 00:10:47,178
you're the star.

82
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:49,213
You're dangerous and mysterious,

83
00:10:49,315 --> 00:10:51,374
and people want to know
more about you.

84
00:10:51,484 --> 00:10:52,883
Get this outta here.

85
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:03,859
Madonna! Madonna!

86
00:11:11,771 --> 00:11:14,467
Yo, man! what the hell is this, bro?

87
00:11:14,573 --> 00:11:16,541
You gonna let everybody in but us?

88
00:11:16,642 --> 00:11:18,837
Damn right, with an attitude like that.

89
00:11:18,944 --> 00:11:21,504
This is bullshit!
I've been here for 45 minutes!

90
00:11:36,595 --> 00:11:38,187
Ciao, Sandra.

91
00:11:38,297 --> 00:11:39,958
- Oh, beautiful.
- How are ya?

92
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,660
You look nice, baby.

93
00:11:55,915 --> 00:11:56,882
Come here.

94
00:12:04,356 --> 00:12:06,756
- Now what?
- what's that around your neck?

95
00:12:06,859 --> 00:12:08,486
- This thing?
- Yeah.

96
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:11,256
- It's new jewelry.
- I thought we talked about this.

97
00:12:13,199 --> 00:12:14,598
Stop it. Stop it!

98
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,267
- Mr. Troiano.
- Andy, it's "Chris. "

99
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:24,342
We got a situation outside, boss.
we need you.

100
00:12:26,746 --> 00:12:30,273
- No way I'm not going in that club!
- I asked you to calm down.

101
00:12:30,382 --> 00:12:31,872
Hell, no, I'm going in the club.

102
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,316
Andy, step aside.
Kim, get back to the door.

103
00:12:35,087 --> 00:12:37,248
- Is there a problem?
- Damn right.

104
00:12:37,356 --> 00:12:38,880
This punk with the suntan's saying

105
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,152
We can't come in the club
'cause of how we're dressed.

106
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:43,028
Suntan.

107
00:12:44,130 --> 00:12:47,293
- And what are you guys, ballplayers?
- Yeah, semi-pro.

108
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:49,765
- Semi-pro!
- Oh, yeah.

109
00:12:49,869 --> 00:12:50,893
Well, I'm very sorry,

110
00:12:51,003 --> 00:12:53,335
<i>but we only let professionals
in my club!</i>

111
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,236
Hey, ignore him! Come here!

112
00:12:55,341 --> 00:12:57,775
- You wanna come to my club?!
- Hey, get over here!

113
00:12:57,877 --> 00:13:00,471
- Calm down!
- Let me go!

114
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,740
There's a van across the street.
See the van?

115
00:13:02,848 --> 00:13:05,282
It's been there since
5:30 this afternoon,

116
00:13:05,384 --> 00:13:06,817
nobody's gotten in or out of it.

117
00:13:07,987 --> 00:13:10,478
- You've been watching it since 5:30?
- Yeah. It's my job.

118
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:13,658
- Don't look at it.
- who is this?

119
00:13:13,759 --> 00:13:16,057
<i>Could be the Enquirer,
could be the cops,</i>

120
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:19,689
but I figured you should know
before you belted this guy in the face.

121
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:23,329
All right.

122
00:13:23,435 --> 00:13:25,096
- Handle this.
- All right.

123
00:13:29,408 --> 00:13:31,399
Let's talk for a second.
Calm down.

124
00:13:31,510 --> 00:13:34,377
Now, listen. There's a van
across the street. You see the van?

125
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,845
Don't look at the van.

126
00:13:35,948 --> 00:13:38,940
It's full of cops, which is why
I brought the boss back inside.

127
00:13:39,051 --> 00:13:41,246
Now, you're not getting
in this club tonight.

128
00:13:41,353 --> 00:13:44,652
<i>But... you come back here
tomorrow night dressed to impress,</i>

129
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:47,487
I will walk you in myself,
and the club picks up the tab.

130
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,925
That's the deal.
Do you want it or not?

131
00:13:50,029 --> 00:13:52,589
- VIP Room and bottle service?
- VIP Room, done.

132
00:13:53,432 --> 00:13:55,866
- All right?
- All right.

133
00:13:55,968 --> 00:13:57,492
You all right, Manny? You okay?

134
00:13:58,103 --> 00:13:59,900
Let's get this rope set back up.

135
00:14:00,005 --> 00:14:01,802
- Andy.
- Yeah.

136
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,838
- A blackjack? what are you gonna do?
- Let's take a walk.

137
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:10,916
I want to see if those college boys
are the only ones who fast-talk.

138
00:14:12,251 --> 00:14:14,048
Hey, where ya goin'?!

139
00:14:20,392 --> 00:14:23,884
- what do you think?
- I think it was the cops.

140
00:14:23,996 --> 00:14:25,224
Not paparazzi?

141
00:14:25,331 --> 00:14:26,457
- Nah.
- why not?

142
00:14:26,565 --> 00:14:29,033
Paparazzi would have stayed
and took your picture.

143
00:14:29,134 --> 00:14:30,601
All right.

144
00:14:46,986 --> 00:14:48,544
Get that ready, will you?

145
00:15:11,310 --> 00:15:14,711
<i>To what do I owe the pleasure
again, Lieutenant Houlton?</i>

146
00:15:14,813 --> 00:15:18,579
I'm just feeling a little unloved because
my name wasn't on the list last night

147
00:15:18,684 --> 00:15:20,174
and I had to miss Puffy and all.

148
00:15:20,286 --> 00:15:23,084
You're looking for love?
Buy yourself a puppy dog.

149
00:15:23,188 --> 00:15:24,746
Just stop hassling my customers.

150
00:15:24,857 --> 00:15:28,520
<i>Since Liquid opened, drug arrests
on South Beach are up 20%y.</i>

151
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:29,855
- So?
- They're club-goers.

152
00:15:29,962 --> 00:15:32,362
I don't like your people or your club
corrupting my city.

153
00:15:32,464 --> 00:15:34,796
My club is clean, and I'm clean.

154
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,626
I'm gonna do you a favor.

155
00:15:38,737 --> 00:15:42,264
You wanna come in and feel the love,
I'll leave your name at the door.

156
00:15:42,374 --> 00:15:43,398
I'll take a rain check.

157
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:46,569
But tell your buddy Madonna
and all your other fancy friends

158
00:15:46,679 --> 00:15:49,307
that I'll be there...
sooner or later.

159
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:50,439
Okay.

160
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,242
Enjoy yourself while you can.

161
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,082
And I don't need my name
on your bullshit list.

162
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,030
Look at this. Real nice.

163
00:17:22,441 --> 00:17:24,500
- Hey, Danny.
- Yo!

164
00:17:24,610 --> 00:17:26,805
- You got a count?
- Yeah.

165
00:17:26,912 --> 00:17:30,177
About 250, minus expenses.

166
00:17:31,417 --> 00:17:34,045
Health inspectors. Code enforcement.
Sanitation boys.

167
00:17:34,153 --> 00:17:36,383
You know they jacked up
the juice again last week?

168
00:17:36,488 --> 00:17:39,423
Cost of doing business.
Don't take it personally.

169
00:17:39,525 --> 00:17:41,550
Do me a favor.
Cut me out two Gs.

170
00:17:49,334 --> 00:17:53,395
Beautiful girls, beautiful girls.
Get these two in right here.

171
00:17:57,643 --> 00:18:00,703
VIPs. I'll take care of
these two right here.

172
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:30,603
Chris?

173
00:18:30,709 --> 00:18:32,768
Two guys are asking
to see the manager.

174
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:34,777
All right, send 'em in.

175
00:18:44,423 --> 00:18:46,414
Are you Mr. Troiano?

176
00:18:50,195 --> 00:18:51,162
I'm Chris Troiano.

177
00:18:53,765 --> 00:18:55,960
You look just like the magazine.

178
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:58,093
Yes, 'cause that's me.

179
00:18:58,203 --> 00:19:00,501
A friend of ours saw the picture

180
00:19:00,606 --> 00:19:03,302
and said maybe you can help us
find some people.

181
00:19:04,877 --> 00:19:07,937
- what are you guys, cops?
- Just friends.

182
00:19:08,046 --> 00:19:11,106
They are supposed to be
friends of yours.

183
00:19:11,216 --> 00:19:12,649
Do you know Mike Block?

184
00:19:14,086 --> 00:19:16,350
- Phil D'Amato?
- No.

185
00:19:16,455 --> 00:19:18,047
Davey Harris?

186
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,284
Tony Pizzo?

187
00:19:20,392 --> 00:19:22,622
- Eddy Boyle?
- No.

188
00:19:22,728 --> 00:19:25,424
Slava Petrov from Staten Island?

189
00:19:26,565 --> 00:19:28,533
Somebody shot his wife dead,
you know.

190
00:19:29,134 --> 00:19:30,465
Very sad.

191
00:19:32,604 --> 00:19:34,435
How about Christian wentz?

192
00:19:34,540 --> 00:19:37,941
Like you, he come from New York
to be a big shot.

193
00:19:38,043 --> 00:19:39,601
I don't know what you're talkin' about.

194
00:19:39,711 --> 00:19:43,340
The man we're looking for
takes money from Slava Petrov.

195
00:19:43,448 --> 00:19:45,609
I think the money comes to you.

196
00:19:45,717 --> 00:19:48,049
Slava Petrov's money is our money.

197
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:50,280
Our money, our club.

198
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,984
I think we partners now.

199
00:19:53,091 --> 00:19:54,422
You're talkin' bullshit.

200
00:19:56,929 --> 00:20:02,526
In the club it's okay the people
think Chris is the boss.

201
00:20:09,474 --> 00:20:11,874
But you remember...

202
00:20:11,977 --> 00:20:13,706
Who is the real boss.

203
00:20:15,180 --> 00:20:17,239
No worries, Mr. Troiano.

204
00:20:18,317 --> 00:20:20,046
I take care of this.

205
00:20:49,147 --> 00:20:50,114
Come here!

206
00:20:51,016 --> 00:20:52,278
Come here!

207
00:20:52,384 --> 00:20:53,442
Get over here!

208
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:06,798
Hold him right there!

209
00:21:08,333 --> 00:21:10,062
You piss in my club?!

210
00:21:10,168 --> 00:21:13,160
Huh?! You wanna piss in my club?!
Now I piss on you!

211
00:21:16,608 --> 00:21:18,303
Get off!

212
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:21,573
<i>Throw 'em in the Dumpster!
I mean in the Dumpster!</i>

213
00:21:28,020 --> 00:21:31,012
You see that puddle over there?
Get all that up.

214
00:21:33,058 --> 00:21:34,025
Hey, boss.

215
00:21:35,160 --> 00:21:38,186
I hope you don't mind me askin',
what was that all about?

216
00:21:38,297 --> 00:21:40,060
How do I know?
They were drunk.

217
00:21:40,165 --> 00:21:41,427
All right, they were drunk.

218
00:21:41,533 --> 00:21:44,297
Drunk or not, somebody pisses
and lights a fire in my club,

219
00:21:44,403 --> 00:21:45,700
I'd be a little bit worried.

220
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,602
- Don't worry about it, all right?
- I ain't worried about it.

221
00:21:48,707 --> 00:21:51,141
- No one's burning me down.
- Good.

222
00:21:51,243 --> 00:21:53,268
I'm actually starting to like this job.

223
00:22:16,735 --> 00:22:18,168
You okay, buddy?

224
00:22:21,340 --> 00:22:22,671
How ya doin'?

225
00:22:22,774 --> 00:22:24,139
- Hey, look out!
- Hey!

226
00:22:28,413 --> 00:22:31,075
- Thank you.
- You look like you could use some help.

227
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:32,172
I think you're right.

228
00:22:32,284 --> 00:22:35,947
Last time I was on a pair of these things,
they still called 'em skates.

229
00:22:36,054 --> 00:22:38,022
Well, the first lesson's free.

230
00:22:38,123 --> 00:22:40,455
Oh, yeah? what about after that?

231
00:22:40,559 --> 00:22:41,958
We'll negotiate.

232
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,290
I can be a pretty hard negotiator.

233
00:22:44,396 --> 00:22:45,988
We'll see about that.

234
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:15,155
Yeah. I'm only telling you
what I heard.

235
00:23:16,228 --> 00:23:17,695
- Albie.
- Yeah?

236
00:23:17,796 --> 00:23:19,354
Tell Danny and Manny
to get over here.

237
00:23:21,867 --> 00:23:24,301
- You sure about this?
- I'm tellin' you what I heard.

238
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:25,837
All right.

239
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,234
Girls, would you
join me for a second?

240
00:23:31,343 --> 00:23:32,708
What's up?

241
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:35,939
we're checkin' I.D. S tonight.
Every one of 'em.

242
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:38,174
And I don't want to see
any candy being sold.

243
00:23:38,283 --> 00:23:39,841
Why? what's the matter?

244
00:23:39,951 --> 00:23:41,885
We're taking a raid tonight.

245
00:23:42,921 --> 00:23:45,014
- Where'd you hear that?
- Doesn't matter.

246
00:23:45,123 --> 00:23:47,455
They're gonna pretend like
they're checking I.D. S,

247
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:49,220
but they're gonna be looking for dope.

248
00:23:49,327 --> 00:23:52,524
You sure? 'Cause I didn't
hear anything like that until tonight.

249
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:55,566
You're talking about losing
a lot of money on account of a rumor.

250
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:57,464
I think it's bullshit.

251
00:23:57,569 --> 00:23:58,536
Maybe.

252
00:23:59,704 --> 00:24:00,932
Just do it.

253
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:12,715
You know the rules... no I.D. S,
no nightclub, no partying.

254
00:24:12,818 --> 00:24:15,480
No weapons and no drugs
allowed in my club.

255
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,418
You can't get in the club.

256
00:24:17,522 --> 00:24:19,387
Keep movin', keep movin'.

257
00:24:19,491 --> 00:24:20,515
Because.

258
00:24:22,060 --> 00:24:24,085
You have I. D? You can't get in.

259
00:24:27,699 --> 00:24:29,826
All right, I know these two.
Come on.

260
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,602
- You got an I. D?
- No.

261
00:25:13,712 --> 00:25:15,179
No I.D., no club. Sorry.

262
00:25:15,280 --> 00:25:16,907
Not tonight. You gotta go.

263
00:25:17,015 --> 00:25:19,711
Come back another time. Sorry.

264
00:25:19,818 --> 00:25:20,944
Not tonight.

265
00:25:22,454 --> 00:25:25,252
It's not too late. we could still
make up part of the night.

266
00:25:27,592 --> 00:25:28,616
You cost me money.

267
00:25:28,727 --> 00:25:32,424
I just told you what I heard, Chris.
I'll make a call if you want.

268
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,556
<i>- Yeah, well, do something.
- All right.</i>

269
00:25:34,666 --> 00:25:36,429
I don't know why you trust this guy.

270
00:25:40,305 --> 00:25:41,602
Let's go, let's go!

271
00:25:42,641 --> 00:25:44,108
How the hell did he know?

272
00:25:45,911 --> 00:25:49,574
- Let's give 'em some room.
- Right this way, officers.

273
00:26:01,726 --> 00:26:03,990
Police. Everybody stay calm,
get against the wall.

274
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:05,995
Let's check some I.D.s. Let's go!

275
00:26:09,267 --> 00:26:12,293
Everybody gets checked for I.D. S...
everybody.

276
00:26:13,338 --> 00:26:14,669
<i>This can't be everybody.</i>

277
00:26:17,042 --> 00:26:18,509
All right, go look.

278
00:26:18,610 --> 00:26:20,305
Everybody face the stage.

279
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:22,812
Everybody calm down,
get against the wall.

280
00:26:22,914 --> 00:26:25,439
I want everybody checked
for I.D. S right now. Let's go.

281
00:26:25,550 --> 00:26:28,018
Are you 21?
Let me see your I.D.

282
00:26:31,122 --> 00:26:33,613
I don't get it. The place is clean.

283
00:26:35,260 --> 00:26:37,660
Let's go! Let's get out of here!
Outside!

284
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:41,822
Thanks for keeping us safe,
Lieutenant.

285
00:26:42,934 --> 00:26:44,162
Appreciate it.

286
00:26:44,269 --> 00:26:45,759
I'll be back, you prick.

287
00:26:46,371 --> 00:26:49,169
Two bottles of beer.
Give this guy a whole bowI of peanuts.

288
00:26:50,308 --> 00:26:52,401
I thought you didn't like peanuts.

289
00:26:52,510 --> 00:26:54,876
A little something for you
after this thing.

290
00:26:54,980 --> 00:26:55,969
Thank you.

291
00:26:58,083 --> 00:26:59,209
Take a walk.

292
00:27:05,123 --> 00:27:06,090
What?

293
00:27:07,792 --> 00:27:08,952
So, how'd you know?

294
00:27:10,128 --> 00:27:11,356
What do you mean, how?

295
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,260
You don't understand the question?

296
00:27:14,299 --> 00:27:15,357
Who told you?

297
00:27:16,401 --> 00:27:17,925
I heard it, that's all.

298
00:27:18,803 --> 00:27:21,795
I pay a lot of money to hear things,
and I didn't hear about tonight.

299
00:27:21,906 --> 00:27:23,498
<i>I want to know how you heard about it.</i>

300
00:27:23,608 --> 00:27:25,371
What does it matter? It worked out.

301
00:27:25,477 --> 00:27:27,604
It matters because
it makes me suspicious,

302
00:27:27,712 --> 00:27:30,875
<i>makes me wonder what else
you know that you're not telling me.</i>

303
00:27:30,982 --> 00:27:33,314
So, I need to know.

304
00:27:33,418 --> 00:27:35,886
- You wanna know?
- Yeah. what are you into?

305
00:27:36,855 --> 00:27:38,789
That guy, the lieutenant there...

306
00:27:38,890 --> 00:27:40,983
- Yeah, the prick Houlton.
- Houlton, yeah.

307
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:43,060
The wife of one his guys told me.

308
00:27:44,029 --> 00:27:46,429
- A cop's wife?
- Yeah.

309
00:27:46,531 --> 00:27:47,998
I met her rollerblading.

310
00:27:51,069 --> 00:27:53,629
- You're banging a cop's wife?
- well, you saw the guy.

311
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:55,706
She says he takes his job
too seriously,

312
00:27:55,807 --> 00:27:57,468
so somebody's gotta do it, right?

313
00:27:57,575 --> 00:27:59,236
What? I'm serious.

314
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:01,107
- You're banging a cop's wife?
- Yeah!

315
00:28:02,814 --> 00:28:06,375
She said I should phone in sick
because they were gonna raid the joint,

316
00:28:06,484 --> 00:28:07,542
so I told you.

317
00:28:07,652 --> 00:28:08,880
What? What?

318
00:28:09,821 --> 00:28:12,085
Next assignment:
Bang Houlton's wife.

319
00:28:12,190 --> 00:28:15,648
- No, you bang Houlton's wife.
- No, no, that's for you!

320
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:17,751
That's your next gig!

321
00:28:40,952 --> 00:28:42,249
Bye.

322
00:28:44,989 --> 00:28:46,320
Now, you see that over there?

323
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:47,891
<i>That is a view.</i>

324
00:28:47,992 --> 00:28:50,654
You did not get a view like that
back in the old neighborhood.

325
00:28:55,633 --> 00:28:57,828
I heard you know
Big Head from Bath Beach.

326
00:28:58,436 --> 00:29:01,371
Big Head? The one who was
gonna marry Anthony's daughter?

327
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:03,373
- Yeah.
- I went to Utrecht with her.

328
00:29:03,475 --> 00:29:05,909
- Of course I know Big Head.
- You went to Utrecht?

329
00:29:08,613 --> 00:29:10,342
Tell me something.

330
00:29:10,448 --> 00:29:12,575
What do you miss most
about New York?

331
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,877
What do you always miss?

332
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:17,477
- The food.
- The food.

333
00:29:18,490 --> 00:29:20,014
Most definitely.

334
00:29:25,363 --> 00:29:28,491
Still, there's worse places
to run away to, you know?

335
00:29:29,067 --> 00:29:30,500
What do you mean?

336
00:29:32,337 --> 00:29:35,568
You got your reasons
for coming down here, I got mine.

337
00:29:36,641 --> 00:29:37,903
Yeah.

338
00:29:38,009 --> 00:29:40,842
There are worse places
you could run away to.

339
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:41,934
No doubt.

340
00:29:59,631 --> 00:30:01,622
- Relax.
- Shadow opens in a month.

341
00:30:01,733 --> 00:30:03,257
They're looking to bury us.

342
00:30:03,368 --> 00:30:04,995
They hired my D.J. S,

343
00:30:05,103 --> 00:30:07,594
they're comping my lists,
which I'm sure they stole,

344
00:30:07,705 --> 00:30:10,003
they're offering crazy deals
to my promoters.

345
00:30:10,108 --> 00:30:12,838
<i>we got a national rep now.
Did you hear what Elle said?</i>

346
00:30:12,944 --> 00:30:15,276
<i>Elle said we're the hottest club
in America.</i>

347
00:30:15,380 --> 00:30:19,248
<i>Vanity Fair, New York mag...
everybody's on our bandwagon.</i>

348
00:30:19,851 --> 00:30:23,343
<i>Variety. Variety calls me
some hunky impresario.</i>

349
00:30:23,454 --> 00:30:27,948
Now, how bad can things be
if I'm a hunky impresario?

350
00:30:28,059 --> 00:30:31,392
All right? we're doing great.
Be proud of what you accomplished.

351
00:30:31,496 --> 00:30:33,964
I'm not afraid of competition.
Nobody's gonna bury us.

352
00:30:34,065 --> 00:30:36,727
Shadow's not competing...
they're looking to screw us.

353
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:40,236
I think they're the ones that have
been making all those complaints...

354
00:30:40,338 --> 00:30:42,704
you know how the city's been on us
about underage kids

355
00:30:42,807 --> 00:30:45,037
and crowd control
and sprinkler system bullshit?

356
00:30:45,143 --> 00:30:47,202
I'm telling you, it's them.

357
00:30:47,312 --> 00:30:50,475
I got it, I get it, I'll take care of it.

358
00:30:50,582 --> 00:30:54,643
But let's not worry about it
until they open. All right?

359
00:30:54,752 --> 00:30:57,084
So you're just gonna let them
steal it from you?

360
00:30:57,188 --> 00:30:59,588
I think you know me better than that.

361
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:34,521
Come on, come on, hurry up.

362
00:31:36,861 --> 00:31:37,828
Let's go.

363
00:31:43,067 --> 00:31:45,865
Come on, let's load up the van.
Let's go. Let's go.

364
00:31:45,970 --> 00:31:47,699
Merry Christmas!

365
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:49,971
All right.

366
00:31:52,877 --> 00:31:54,504
Nothin' but the finest.

367
00:32:04,722 --> 00:32:06,019
Let's have some fun.

368
00:32:08,459 --> 00:32:10,086
Red or white?

369
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:12,690
Whatever. Just make it a good year.

370
00:32:18,102 --> 00:32:19,501
Play ball!

371
00:32:21,606 --> 00:32:23,198
Goin' long.

372
00:32:23,308 --> 00:32:24,866
Yeah!

373
00:32:24,976 --> 00:32:26,443
Go long! Go long!

374
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:40,288
Go long!

375
00:33:07,719 --> 00:33:09,619
I didn't know we stocked this brand.

376
00:33:10,388 --> 00:33:11,912
- Boss.
- Yeah?

377
00:33:12,023 --> 00:33:14,617
She just said that we don't
stock this brand here.

378
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:17,786
There's some new Russian stuff.
We're gonna have that for a while.

379
00:33:17,895 --> 00:33:19,453
This is the new good stuff.

380
00:33:19,564 --> 00:33:21,464
Hey, boss!

381
00:33:21,566 --> 00:33:24,126
Go long! Go long!

382
00:33:24,235 --> 00:33:26,499
You go. Go. Go long.

383
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:55,363
Again. All right.

384
00:34:13,084 --> 00:34:15,348
This could be
a little difficult to accomplish.

385
00:34:16,254 --> 00:34:18,085
Our friend has a complete faith

386
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,919
<i>that you can accomplish
anything you put your mind to.</i>

387
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:42,045
Next we're building Joia restaurant
and the Bar Room lounge.

388
00:34:42,146 --> 00:34:43,875
Van Dyk and Oakenfold are gonna D.J.

389
00:34:43,981 --> 00:34:45,676
It's gonna be really hot.

390
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:48,411
I already got commitments
from Jennifer, Puffy,

391
00:34:48,519 --> 00:34:52,546
Gloria Estefan, the Donald,
my whole gang.

392
00:34:52,657 --> 00:34:54,921
And we're franchising Liquid
to other cities...

393
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:57,324
Liquid Lounge Las Vegas
and Liquid Lounge New York

394
00:34:57,428 --> 00:34:58,895
are already on the fast track.

395
00:34:58,996 --> 00:35:01,658
I'm meeting Rudy's people
next week at Gracie Mansion

396
00:35:01,766 --> 00:35:05,634
while the liquor boards are doing
their due diligence with the licenses.

397
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:08,034
I'm telling you guys,
it's gonna be beyond huge.

398
00:35:08,139 --> 00:35:09,106
It's all my doing.

399
00:35:10,141 --> 00:35:11,574
But you know, at the end of the day

400
00:35:11,676 --> 00:35:13,371
I could find the cure for cancer,

401
00:35:13,478 --> 00:35:15,708
and I'm still only
gonna be known as who?

402
00:35:15,813 --> 00:35:17,337
Madonna's girlfriend.

403
00:35:17,448 --> 00:35:19,439
That's right.

404
00:35:19,550 --> 00:35:20,710
Cheers.

405
00:35:48,346 --> 00:35:50,940
You didn't look too excited
to see Carlos and Enrique last night.

406
00:35:51,048 --> 00:35:52,447
What's your problem with those guys?

407
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:54,177
<i>What do I care about them pendejos?</i>

408
00:35:54,986 --> 00:35:57,682
They're just pissed 'cause
the Russians spilled their drinks.

409
00:35:57,788 --> 00:35:58,755
Yeah?

410
00:35:59,357 --> 00:36:01,587
Take a couple of these.
You'll swell right up.

411
00:36:01,692 --> 00:36:05,219
My cousin O.D.'ed on steroids.
I won't take 'em, and neither should you.

412
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,627
well, that's why I don't overdo it.

413
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:10,857
I just do it 'cause it gets me there faster.

414
00:36:13,604 --> 00:36:14,969
You want I should spot you?

415
00:36:15,072 --> 00:36:16,039
No, no. I'm all right.

416
00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:17,903
You gotta have somebody
watch your back.

417
00:36:18,009 --> 00:36:20,341
All right. On three.

418
00:36:20,444 --> 00:36:22,036
One, two, three.

419
00:36:35,693 --> 00:36:38,856
<i>Bellissimo, bellissimo.</i>

420
00:36:38,963 --> 00:36:41,488
<i>- Grazie, Mr. Versace.
- But it isn't mine!</i>

421
00:36:41,599 --> 00:36:43,464
I'm wearing Christian Dior tonight.

422
00:36:43,568 --> 00:36:45,661
- Hey, Gianni, how are you?
- Danny.

423
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:16,200
Yeah?

424
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:19,736
<i>Chris, a friend of ours wants
to catch up with you tomorrow.</i>

425
00:37:21,973 --> 00:37:23,873
Tomorrow's not really
a good day for me.

426
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:25,738
<i>You wouldn't refuse a friend,
would you?</i>

427
00:37:28,613 --> 00:37:29,807
Where?

428
00:37:47,898 --> 00:37:49,923
- Larry, meet Baya.
- How you doing?

429
00:37:56,974 --> 00:37:58,066
Andy.

430
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,543
Hey. Ya see this?

431
00:38:00,645 --> 00:38:02,510
Doin' all right?
what you drinkin' there?

432
00:38:03,147 --> 00:38:05,741
It's yours.
Your bartender made it.

433
00:38:05,850 --> 00:38:07,647
- Fresh.
- All right, all right.

434
00:38:07,752 --> 00:38:09,481
No, no, I'll take the beer. Go ahead.

435
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:10,918
Okay, have a good time.

436
00:38:12,423 --> 00:38:15,324
You settle down.
Give me my drink. Come on.

437
00:39:00,004 --> 00:39:01,062
Sorry.

438
00:39:04,075 --> 00:39:06,009
Come on, Olivia, open the door.

439
00:39:07,044 --> 00:39:09,877
Will you cut the crap? Open up!

440
00:39:09,980 --> 00:39:10,969
What's going on?

441
00:39:11,082 --> 00:39:13,175
It's her. She's been
messing around again.

442
00:39:13,284 --> 00:39:16,048
If you don't open the door,
I'm breaking it in!

443
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:20,447
Come on, come on.

444
00:39:23,427 --> 00:39:25,156
Oh, no. what are you doing?

445
00:39:25,763 --> 00:39:26,730
See this?

446
00:39:26,831 --> 00:39:29,129
This is what I'm talking about.
Look at you!

447
00:39:29,233 --> 00:39:30,723
Stop it!

448
00:39:30,835 --> 00:39:33,531
Stop it! You're not my father!

449
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:36,606
- Stop it!
- Andy, clean that up for me.

450
00:39:36,707 --> 00:39:38,572
Come on, we're going.

451
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:51,148
<i>- Ciao.
- Good morning.</i>

452
00:39:54,658 --> 00:39:55,750
<i>Ciao.</i>

453
00:40:01,031 --> 00:40:01,998
Signor Versace?

454
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:16,207
How's Olivia doin'?

455
00:40:16,313 --> 00:40:19,578
Yeah, I signed her in,
got her bedded down in the rehab.

456
00:40:19,683 --> 00:40:21,446
She'll do all right.
Be good for her.

457
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:24,380
Oh, my God.

458
00:40:26,190 --> 00:40:28,750
Lieutenant Houlton.
How'd I know I'd see you today?

459
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:31,259
Do us both a favor
and can the smart-ass for five minutes.

460
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:32,329
You seen him?

461
00:40:33,898 --> 00:40:35,058
His name's Andrew Cunanan.

462
00:40:35,166 --> 00:40:38,226
He's wanted in four murders
across the country.

463
00:40:38,335 --> 00:40:39,632
I know he's been to your club.

464
00:40:39,737 --> 00:40:42,729
I also know that half of South Beach
was at your house last night,

465
00:40:42,840 --> 00:40:44,740
including Versace.
You seen him?

466
00:40:44,842 --> 00:40:46,935
I can't help you out.

467
00:40:47,044 --> 00:40:48,602
Look, Officer, this...

468
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:50,873
He's mourning the loss
of a friend right now.

469
00:40:50,981 --> 00:40:53,211
This guy wasn't at the party
or the club either.

470
00:40:53,317 --> 00:40:55,717
- Who asked you?
- You asked the both of us.

471
00:40:55,820 --> 00:40:57,151
- What's your name?
- Andy.

472
00:40:57,254 --> 00:40:58,744
- Andy what?
- Andy Burnett. what?

473
00:40:58,856 --> 00:41:00,619
Get against the wall.
Pat him down.

474
00:41:00,724 --> 00:41:03,124
- Get against the wall.
- You wanna bring us downtown?

475
00:41:03,227 --> 00:41:05,218
Keep your mouth shut.
Don't move.

476
00:41:05,329 --> 00:41:07,729
Your boyfriend go to
the same charm school you did?

477
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:10,528
You got nothing better to do?
It's a big city... 30 other clubs.

478
00:41:10,701 --> 00:41:11,998
You gotta mess with me?

479
00:41:12,102 --> 00:41:15,071
Hey, lighten up.
I'll be in touch.

480
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:19,066
<i>Be in touch.
Touch this.</i>

481
00:41:19,176 --> 00:41:21,736
I can't stand that guy.
I can't stand the sight of him.

482
00:41:21,846 --> 00:41:24,178
- He likes you too.
- Scumbag.

483
00:41:24,281 --> 00:41:27,512
I'll let Danny open up.
Let's get outta here, clear our heads.

484
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:38,860
I can't believe you're
dumb enough to let me drive this.

485
00:41:38,963 --> 00:41:41,898
You haven't driven anything yet.
Open it up. Come on.

486
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:46,236
There you go.

487
00:41:54,912 --> 00:41:56,402
What the hell is this?

488
00:41:57,948 --> 00:42:00,178
They're probably
just trying to jack the car.

489
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:03,811
They're in a $90,000 car themselves.
why they want to jack our car for?

490
00:42:05,256 --> 00:42:06,450
Lose 'em.

491
00:42:17,768 --> 00:42:19,326
What the hell are they doing?

492
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:23,763
- Scumbags.
- who is it?!

493
00:42:23,874 --> 00:42:25,341
It's those Russian bitches.

494
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:29,074
Son-of-a-bitch!

495
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:34,084
Keep the car straight.

496
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:43,255
Damn it!

497
00:42:55,406 --> 00:42:57,306
Take the next right.
I'm gonna reload.

498
00:42:58,309 --> 00:42:59,708
Okay.

499
00:43:12,323 --> 00:43:15,520
You got some kind of problem
you're not telling me about?

500
00:43:17,261 --> 00:43:19,092
- No, that's just a warning.
- No.

501
00:43:19,196 --> 00:43:22,461
Pissing on the floor, that's a warning.
These guys are shooting bullets.

502
00:43:22,566 --> 00:43:25,000
If they wanted to kill us,
we'd be dead by now.

503
00:43:25,102 --> 00:43:26,467
Give me the keys.

504
00:43:26,570 --> 00:43:27,867
That's a real comfort.

505
00:43:28,906 --> 00:43:29,895
Let's get out of here.

506
00:43:51,028 --> 00:43:53,019
1963 went that way.

507
00:43:53,130 --> 00:43:55,724
You said we're going fishing.
I dressed to go fishing.

508
00:43:55,833 --> 00:43:57,061
What are you fishing for?

509
00:43:57,167 --> 00:43:58,964
You think this is the pier
at Sheepshead Bay?

510
00:43:59,069 --> 00:44:01,037
I'm surprised they let you on the dock.

511
00:44:01,138 --> 00:44:02,537
Good morning to you too.

512
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:06,201
Come on, untie us.
Hurry up, before they lock you up.

513
00:44:15,452 --> 00:44:18,285
- The water's beautiful, isn't it?
- No.

514
00:44:18,389 --> 00:44:20,755
- No? why not?
- I don't like the water.

515
00:44:20,858 --> 00:44:22,325
I can't swim. I'm a city kid.

516
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:23,552
- You can't swim?
- No.

517
00:44:23,661 --> 00:44:24,628
Neither could I.

518
00:44:24,728 --> 00:44:26,889
I learned how, though.
Did you even try?

519
00:44:26,997 --> 00:44:29,397
Yeah, I tried.
Every time I tried, I sank.

520
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:32,901
If you're gonna be hanging out with me,
get your act together.

521
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:34,971
Change the way you dress.
You look like a schlep.

522
00:44:35,072 --> 00:44:36,630
Whaddya mean, I look like a schlep?

523
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:39,739
There they are, right up here.

524
00:44:44,381 --> 00:44:45,746
Christopher.

525
00:44:47,618 --> 00:44:49,552
- Hey, brother.
- what's up, man?

526
00:44:49,653 --> 00:44:50,620
How ya doin'?

527
00:44:50,721 --> 00:44:53,212
I didn't know you were friends
with Jimmy Buffet.

528
00:44:53,323 --> 00:44:54,290
Funny.

529
00:44:54,892 --> 00:44:55,859
Chris.

530
00:44:55,959 --> 00:44:57,017
How are ya?

531
00:44:58,429 --> 00:45:00,056
Glad you made it.

532
00:45:00,164 --> 00:45:01,597
You guys want a cool drink?

533
00:45:01,699 --> 00:45:04,395
How about a mojito?
Two mojitos?

534
00:45:04,501 --> 00:45:07,026
- Two is good.
- Get 'em two mojitos.

535
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:09,628
- You like fishing?
- This guy can't even swim!

536
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:12,208
No, I can fish.
I can't swim, but I can fish.

537
00:45:12,309 --> 00:45:14,004
Give him a pole.

538
00:45:14,111 --> 00:45:15,806
- Come inside.
- There's no line.

539
00:45:17,114 --> 00:45:19,014
You'll figure it out.
You're a smart boy.

540
00:45:20,117 --> 00:45:22,210
We won't be long. Don't worry.

541
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:24,014
- Mojito.
- Thank you.

542
00:45:35,632 --> 00:45:39,124
Hey, you guys got
any Dramamine or anything?

543
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:41,898
'Cause I'm feeling
a little seasick right now.

544
00:45:42,005 --> 00:45:45,497
- Do it over the side, man.
- No, I just want to go in the bathroom.

545
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:48,271
Can I just go in and find
some medicine or something?

546
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:51,247
Go inside behind the bar.

547
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,077
- Yeah, there, man.
- Thank you.

548
00:45:53,183 --> 00:45:55,276
- Don't touch any of our things.
- No, I won't.

549
00:46:02,159 --> 00:46:05,822
<i>Get it into your head, Chris.
This is win-win for the both of us.</i>

550
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,863
<i>There's nothing else to discuss.</i>

551
00:46:10,334 --> 00:46:11,528
<i>Andy, come back outside,</i>

552
00:46:11,635 --> 00:46:13,227
now!

553
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:24,238
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm good.

554
00:46:24,348 --> 00:46:25,508
- Yeah?
- Thanks. Yeah.

555
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:34,747
<i>- I got a bite!
- Mira!</i>

556
00:46:34,858 --> 00:46:36,291
Bring it in the boat!

557
00:46:42,232 --> 00:46:44,757
I learned that from Jimmy Buffet,
all right?

558
00:46:48,472 --> 00:46:50,736
Hello. Looks like
they got some company.

559
00:46:56,413 --> 00:46:59,280
It's the nightclub guy,
and he's got somebody with him.

560
00:47:00,184 --> 00:47:01,481
Do you recognize him?

561
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:06,282
Gotta be somebody if they brought him
for a meeting with Allie Boy.

562
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:08,290
How we gonna I.D. Him?

563
00:47:10,494 --> 00:47:12,155
I got an idea.

564
00:47:26,944 --> 00:47:29,845
You ain't said a word to me
the whole ride back.

565
00:47:29,947 --> 00:47:31,175
What?

566
00:47:31,281 --> 00:47:33,442
You ain't said one word to me
the whole ride back.

567
00:47:33,550 --> 00:47:35,211
You wanna tell me what
that was about?

568
00:47:35,319 --> 00:47:37,879
Nothin'. Mind your business.

569
00:47:38,422 --> 00:47:41,050
You're the boss. You want me
to play dumb, I'll play dumb.

570
00:47:42,793 --> 00:47:44,124
But I gotta tell ya something.

571
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:46,321
If you went to Allie Boy
for anything at all,

572
00:47:46,430 --> 00:47:48,489
you might as well
put a gun to your head.

573
00:47:51,201 --> 00:47:52,168
Allie Boy?

574
00:47:53,237 --> 00:47:54,204
Yeah.

575
00:47:55,239 --> 00:47:57,298
I don't remember making
any introductions.

576
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:00,343
Why would I need to be
introduced to Allie Boy?

577
00:48:00,444 --> 00:48:02,344
Everybody knows who Allie Boy is.

578
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:05,911
Okay, I've known him
since we were kids.

579
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:08,109
He heard about the Russians
taking a shot at us.

580
00:48:08,218 --> 00:48:10,379
He thought he could help.
He offered. That's it.

581
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:13,684
- So what's he gonna do?
- Nothin', all right?

582
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:16,224
I told him I could handle
what needed to be handled.

583
00:48:16,326 --> 00:48:18,317
End of story, end of questions.

584
00:48:19,429 --> 00:48:20,555
End of questions.

585
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:38,174
Here we go.

586
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:41,376
Okay, Dave,
he's leaving the marina now.

587
00:48:58,268 --> 00:49:00,828
- Good afternoon, sir.
- How ya doin', Officer?

588
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,166
License and registration.

589
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,838
I got a license,
but I don't have a registration

590
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:08,571
'cause the car belongs
to a friend of mine, so...

591
00:49:11,315 --> 00:49:13,215
Sir, can I search the bag, please?

592
00:49:14,651 --> 00:49:16,084
The bag, please, sir.

593
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,656
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

594
00:49:28,799 --> 00:49:30,630
I suppose this belongs
to a friend too.

595
00:49:31,668 --> 00:49:32,794
<i>why don't you cooperate</i>

596
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:34,530
before your warrants come back

597
00:49:34,638 --> 00:49:36,765
and you find yourself
deeper in the hole?

598
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:41,243
Keep grinning, tough guy,

599
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:43,245
and your bargaining's over.

600
00:49:44,381 --> 00:49:46,576
Is that what we're doing?
Bargaining?

601
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:57,922
Mike Hawke. Eastern District
Organized Crime Task Force.

602
00:49:58,028 --> 00:49:59,962
Charlie Glaser, FBI Miami.

603
00:50:00,063 --> 00:50:01,928
- Good to meet you.
- Eastern District?

604
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:04,728
That's New York.
Aren't you a little far from home?

605
00:50:04,835 --> 00:50:07,497
Not really. what are you
doing with that guy?

606
00:50:11,341 --> 00:50:12,672
Recognize any of them?

607
00:50:13,777 --> 00:50:17,645
Yeah, that's Alphonse. "Allie Boy. "
Head of the Colombo crime family.

608
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:19,978
We've been working him
since he's been down here.

609
00:50:20,083 --> 00:50:22,677
Today we got him at a meeting
with Chris Troiano.

610
00:50:22,786 --> 00:50:25,152
South Beach hotshot.
Probably a front.

611
00:50:25,255 --> 00:50:28,782
He brought along this wise-ass muscle
who works for him, Andy Burnett.

612
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:30,120
He was in possession of a weapon.

613
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:33,253
So you leverage that to flip him,

614
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,194
and that gives you
eyes and ears on the inside.

615
00:50:35,799 --> 00:50:37,664
- It's a nice plan, except...
- Except what?

616
00:50:37,768 --> 00:50:39,793
He's already on our side.

617
00:50:39,903 --> 00:50:41,530
He's an undercover cop.

618
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:57,945
Sorry we don't have any bikini babes
up here serving champagne.

619
00:50:58,055 --> 00:50:59,022
This'll do.

620
00:51:02,125 --> 00:51:05,288
- Haven't heard from you lately.
- Things are happening.

621
00:51:05,395 --> 00:51:06,885
We know that.

622
00:51:06,997 --> 00:51:10,262
Troiano's branching out in South Beach
and trying to move to New York.

623
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:14,394
His girlfriend Olivia's fronting for him,
and you're his new right-hand man.

624
00:51:14,504 --> 00:51:16,768
Seems he's one of Allie Boy's
biggest earners.

625
00:51:16,873 --> 00:51:18,500
I don't have that nailed down yet.

626
00:51:18,608 --> 00:51:21,236
Bullshit.
Allie Boy's gotta be behind him.

627
00:51:21,344 --> 00:51:22,936
I'm not hearing any of this from you.

628
00:51:24,481 --> 00:51:27,143
When were you gonna tell me about
getting shot at by the Russians?

629
00:51:27,250 --> 00:51:30,276
- It'll be in my report.
- You're a cop, Andy.

630
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:34,289
Even in deep cover, don't you think
getting shot at justifies a phone call?

631
00:51:34,391 --> 00:51:36,484
The Russians are connected
to a Slava Petrov.

632
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:39,323
They had some bad business with Chris,
they feel they're owed.

633
00:51:39,429 --> 00:51:41,420
Partnership in the club
is part of the payment.

634
00:51:41,531 --> 00:51:43,658
- what about the Allie Boy sit-down?
- what about it?

635
00:51:43,767 --> 00:51:45,428
I didn't know Allie Boy was on the boat,

636
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:48,003
and you know damn well
I got pinched as soon as I got off.

637
00:51:51,541 --> 00:51:53,270
You know what I think?

638
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:55,606
Maybe you're getting
to like the life too much...

639
00:51:55,712 --> 00:51:59,307
the cars, the boats,
the broads, the booze.

640
00:51:59,416 --> 00:52:01,976
Look, Mike, you knew this thing
was gonna take time.

641
00:52:02,085 --> 00:52:03,575
Chris, he's just a means to the end.

642
00:52:03,687 --> 00:52:05,177
You want to follow it to Allie Boy,

643
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:08,689
or do you want me to bust this kid
on steroid and burglary charges?

644
00:52:08,792 --> 00:52:10,487
- I got that nailed down.
- Don't get smart.

645
00:52:10,594 --> 00:52:12,357
- I'm not gettin' smart.
- Yeah, you are.

646
00:52:12,462 --> 00:52:14,259
No. You guys brought me in
to do the job.

647
00:52:14,364 --> 00:52:16,662
You gotta let me do it
the way I know how, Mike.

648
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:19,860
Months ago we had nothing.
Now I got a sit-down on Allie Boy's boat.

649
00:52:19,970 --> 00:52:21,562
I call that progress.

650
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:26,140
You know Allie Boy's got a 12-gauge
Mossberg below the deck?

651
00:52:26,243 --> 00:52:28,575
We can't prove it's his,
but it's enough to hold him

652
00:52:28,678 --> 00:52:30,873
until we can get these
other charges to stick.

653
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:33,710
What about the Latin twins?

654
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:38,253
They show up with briefcases,
they go behind closed doors with Chris,

655
00:52:38,355 --> 00:52:39,982
they leave without briefcases.

656
00:52:41,091 --> 00:52:43,059
So when were you gonna
tell me about this?

657
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:44,559
I just did.

658
00:52:44,661 --> 00:52:46,151
A narcotics angle, then.

659
00:52:46,263 --> 00:52:48,288
Is he moving it for himself or Allie Boy?

660
00:52:48,398 --> 00:52:52,232
There's stuff moving through the club,
but I don't know whose hands are dirty.

661
00:52:52,335 --> 00:52:56,032
As far as I know, it's just club kids
and Chris lets it go.

662
00:52:56,139 --> 00:52:59,540
You wanna know about narcotics,
talk to Lieutenant Houlton.

663
00:52:59,643 --> 00:53:00,769
Guy'll help you out.

664
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:02,868
He's got a hard-on for Chris
on a drug charge

665
00:53:02,979 --> 00:53:04,503
worse than a newborn baby wants tit.

666
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:08,709
- You're a font of useful information.
- I try.

667
00:53:08,818 --> 00:53:10,786
These are the new rules:

668
00:53:10,887 --> 00:53:13,720
If I found out you're not
telling me everything,

669
00:53:13,823 --> 00:53:15,882
I'm gonna have to believe
you've gone native.

670
00:53:15,992 --> 00:53:17,857
That's the day I'm gonna pull you out.

671
00:53:17,961 --> 00:53:20,259
And I won't care if you're
on your way with a shovel

672
00:53:20,363 --> 00:53:22,354
to dig up Jimmy Hoffa,
you got that?

673
00:53:22,465 --> 00:53:24,626
- Andy?
- I got it, Mike.

674
00:53:27,837 --> 00:53:29,361
Stay in touch.

675
00:53:32,576 --> 00:53:35,909
Mike, think you could work on
getting me a clothing allowance?

676
00:53:36,012 --> 00:53:39,914
These clothes
are like 1963 or something.

677
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:48,948
- Chris.
- Yeah?

678
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:51,027
It's Johnson again, man.

679
00:53:51,127 --> 00:53:52,560
That greedy prick.

680
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:54,323
- He outside?
- Yeah, he's outside.

681
00:53:54,431 --> 00:53:55,762
Send him in.

682
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:57,093
What's going on?

683
00:53:57,200 --> 00:53:59,566
The fire marshal wants more money.

684
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:01,603
Been taking care of his whole family.

685
00:54:01,705 --> 00:54:03,332
- Let me take care of it.
- Hold it.

686
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,567
He doesn't want anybody but Chris,
so stay out of it.

687
00:54:06,643 --> 00:54:07,610
Okay.

688
00:54:15,852 --> 00:54:17,217
Mr. Troiano.

689
00:54:18,755 --> 00:54:19,881
You have a problem.

690
00:54:20,490 --> 00:54:21,457
Just one?

691
00:54:21,558 --> 00:54:24,254
The city has just issued
new occupancy capacity formulas

692
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:25,953
that are gonna impact your seating.

693
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:27,290
Oh, is that so?

694
00:54:27,397 --> 00:54:30,423
So that means I'm gonna have to
let more people in my club?

695
00:54:30,533 --> 00:54:34,663
No, I'm afraid your legal occupancy
will be cut in half.

696
00:54:34,771 --> 00:54:36,466
Effective immediately.

697
00:54:36,573 --> 00:54:38,268
What is this?

698
00:54:46,716 --> 00:54:47,910
It's bullshit.

699
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:49,747
Let's keep it civil, Mr. Troiano.

700
00:54:49,853 --> 00:54:52,947
I'm only here to make sure
that you comply with the code.

701
00:54:53,056 --> 00:54:56,219
Danny, ask this crooked prick
how much it's gonna cost me.

702
00:54:58,328 --> 00:55:00,990
- How much?
- How dare you.

703
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:03,497
How dare I? what's the number?

704
00:55:03,600 --> 00:55:06,763
I'm calling the office right now
and I'm gonna take you in for bribery.

705
00:55:06,870 --> 00:55:08,770
Oh, yeah?

706
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:11,136
You're sure that's what
you wanna do?

707
00:55:11,241 --> 00:55:13,835
All right. In that case,
let me give you a reason.

708
00:55:15,312 --> 00:55:17,337
- What are you doing?
- Hey! Hey!

709
00:55:17,447 --> 00:55:18,880
What are you doing?

710
00:55:18,982 --> 00:55:20,677
I'm gonna get you closed down!

711
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:22,649
Settle down.
Manny, get him out of here.

712
00:55:22,752 --> 00:55:26,586
You won't be able to open a hot dog
stand when I get through with you!

713
00:55:26,690 --> 00:55:28,624
Come back in. Any time.

714
00:55:28,725 --> 00:55:30,317
- You all right?
- I'm all right.

715
00:55:30,427 --> 00:55:32,224
Just chill out!

716
00:55:32,329 --> 00:55:35,628
He's under a lot of pressure right now.
Everybody's squeezing him.

717
00:55:35,732 --> 00:55:37,165
He's not gonna get away with this.

718
00:55:37,267 --> 00:55:38,859
You want to get closed down?

719
00:55:38,968 --> 00:55:40,560
You've had your hand out so long

720
00:55:40,670 --> 00:55:42,934
you're forgetting
about your neck right now.

721
00:55:43,039 --> 00:55:45,564
You go to the cops, everybody loses.
You follow me?

722
00:55:45,675 --> 00:55:47,006
Hey. Do you follow me?

723
00:55:47,610 --> 00:55:49,908
- Yes.
- Now, let's talk. Come on.

724
00:55:50,513 --> 00:55:51,537
He deserved it.

725
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:54,242
Johnson's the third guy
double-banging me this week.

726
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,410
You're gonna have to pay him
twice as much.

727
00:55:56,519 --> 00:55:58,248
Yeah? So what. It was worth it.

728
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:02,324
I come down here to start over,
you know?

729
00:56:02,425 --> 00:56:04,620
Build something.
Leave a lot of stuff behind.

730
00:56:05,929 --> 00:56:07,419
I started it up with my sweat.

731
00:56:07,530 --> 00:56:11,261
There's a line of a hundred people
with their hands freakin' stickin' out.

732
00:56:11,368 --> 00:56:14,030
Everybody thinks they deserve a piece.

733
00:56:14,137 --> 00:56:16,367
Everybody thinks they're entitled.

734
00:56:16,473 --> 00:56:19,374
Sanitation, Health Board...

735
00:56:20,543 --> 00:56:21,703
fire marshals...

736
00:56:26,282 --> 00:56:28,580
How about big boss Allie Boy?

737
00:56:28,685 --> 00:56:31,882
<i>Yeah? How about you, Andy?
How much do you want?</i>

738
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:35,553
Or maybe you're already
taking your piece.

739
00:56:36,993 --> 00:56:38,460
That what you think?

740
00:56:41,498 --> 00:56:42,863
I'm just pissed.

741
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:44,958
Hey.

742
00:56:46,836 --> 00:56:48,667
You forgot these at the club.

743
00:56:48,772 --> 00:56:51,172
You might want to be careful
next time.

744
00:57:01,885 --> 00:57:04,149
- Okay.
- Here we go. Here we go.

745
00:57:04,254 --> 00:57:05,744
Two more steps.

746
00:57:08,425 --> 00:57:10,359
One, two...

747
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:15,223
...three.
- Surprise!

748
00:57:18,568 --> 00:57:19,933
"The bitch is back. "

749
00:57:20,970 --> 00:57:23,131
I love it. Thank you so much.

750
00:57:24,941 --> 00:57:27,569
- This is great.
- welcome back.

751
00:57:29,179 --> 00:57:31,613
It's all right. It's club soda.
Boss's orders.

752
00:57:33,183 --> 00:57:36,448
While we welcome Olivia back,
let's just take one moment,

753
00:57:36,553 --> 00:57:38,248
we gotta say good-bye to Danny,

754
00:57:38,354 --> 00:57:40,845
who's been with Liquid
from the very beginning,

755
00:57:40,957 --> 00:57:43,653
at the steering wheel,
going back home.

756
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:46,422
We wish you nothing but luck,
my friend,

757
00:57:46,529 --> 00:57:48,292
and I don't think I'm alone
when I say:

758
00:57:48,398 --> 00:57:51,128
May all your ups and downs
be between the sheets.

759
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:54,903
Let's have some fun, all right?

760
00:58:29,606 --> 00:58:31,471
- You guys good to go?
- Yep.

761
00:58:35,211 --> 00:58:37,975
<i>So far the police
are not telling us what led them</i>

762
00:58:38,081 --> 00:58:40,242
<i>to the black BMwluxury car</i>

763
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,580
<i>at a remote park at Key Biscayne,</i>

764
00:58:42,685 --> 00:58:45,518
<i>but inside the trunk they found
the bodies of the two men</i>

765
00:58:45,622 --> 00:58:48,955
<i>identified as Alexi Papov
and Dimitri Kroutik.</i>

766
00:58:49,058 --> 00:58:51,856
<i>Police sources say
they suspect both men last night</i>

767
00:58:51,961 --> 00:58:54,122
<i>were victims of a mob-like hit,</i>

768
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:56,630
<i>and there were bullet holes
in their car</i>

769
00:58:56,733 --> 00:58:59,998
<i>indicating there may have been
a high-speed chase</i>

770
00:59:00,103 --> 00:59:01,229
<i>before the murders.</i>

771
00:59:01,337 --> 00:59:04,170
<i>we'll be back
with more in a minute.</i>

772
00:59:07,710 --> 00:59:11,339
This wouldn't have anything to do
with our little boat trip, would it?

773
00:59:11,447 --> 00:59:13,438
How do I know?

774
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,017
What do I care?

775
00:59:15,118 --> 00:59:16,608
Well, you should care.

776
00:59:16,719 --> 00:59:19,950
We could have to answer
some really important questions soon.

777
00:59:20,056 --> 00:59:21,580
What are you talking about?

778
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:23,488
We had a brawI
with these two dead guys

779
00:59:23,593 --> 00:59:26,756
in front of a dozen witnesses,
not to mention a car chase.

780
00:59:26,863 --> 00:59:29,297
So what if the cops pull
the slugs out of that BMw

781
00:59:29,399 --> 00:59:31,560
and find they match a gun
registered to you?

782
00:59:31,668 --> 00:59:33,397
You gonna say you lost the gun?

783
00:59:33,503 --> 00:59:35,971
They're gonna say,
"why didn't you report it lost?"

784
00:59:36,072 --> 00:59:39,041
- They shot at us first.
- They're dead!

785
00:59:39,142 --> 00:59:42,441
<i>Nobody can arrest them.
They can arrest us. we're the live ones!</i>

786
00:59:43,880 --> 00:59:45,006
Think about it.

787
00:59:49,452 --> 00:59:50,783
Yeah.

788
00:59:52,755 --> 00:59:53,722
Okay.

789
00:59:54,757 --> 00:59:55,883
All right.

790
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,624
I'll be right back. wait here.

791
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:41,226
Everything all right?

792
01:00:49,879 --> 01:00:51,471
Come on, we're going for a ride.

793
01:00:52,515 --> 01:00:54,380
- Let me just grab my phone.
- No.

794
01:00:56,452 --> 01:00:57,885
You won't need it.

795
01:01:20,009 --> 01:01:21,306
Where we headin', boss?

796
01:01:47,270 --> 01:01:48,464
Get out.

797
01:02:12,295 --> 01:02:14,593
- Start walking.
- what are we doing?

798
01:02:16,999 --> 01:02:18,694
You never been to the 'glades, Andy?

799
01:02:18,801 --> 01:02:21,167
No. why would I want to?

800
01:02:23,306 --> 01:02:25,331
There's the gator.

801
01:02:25,441 --> 01:02:27,170
Maybe he smells dinner.

802
01:02:30,379 --> 01:02:31,403
Go on.

803
01:02:34,383 --> 01:02:36,544
Sometimes you gotta
feed the gators, Andy,

804
01:02:36,652 --> 01:02:39,052
<i>or they'll come out of the swamp
and eat you.</i>

805
01:02:43,593 --> 01:02:45,584
What the hell are we doing here?

806
01:02:50,600 --> 01:02:55,128
You know, back in Bath Beach,
there's two ways to stay out of trouble...

807
01:02:55,238 --> 01:02:57,468
you either pay someone off

808
01:02:57,573 --> 01:03:00,269
or make sure nothing ties you
to anything that could be trouble.

809
01:03:00,376 --> 01:03:02,742
Nothing, nobody.

810
01:03:02,845 --> 01:03:05,313
So what's that got to do with me?

811
01:03:08,351 --> 01:03:11,912
Officer Dave came by
with some disturbing news.

812
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:13,511
Like what?

813
01:03:15,458 --> 01:03:17,016
You were right.

814
01:03:17,126 --> 01:03:19,959
They pulled some slugs out of the BMw,
just like you said.

815
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:22,155
They're looking for a match.

816
01:03:33,342 --> 01:03:34,900
Now you're thinking.

817
01:03:36,145 --> 01:03:37,635
Look at you.

818
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:40,272
You don't like it out here
in the boonies, do you?

819
01:03:41,117 --> 01:03:43,017
- Why would I?
- City kid.

820
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:44,643
It's hot out here.

821
01:03:50,927 --> 01:03:51,894
Lieutenant.

822
01:03:53,362 --> 01:03:54,659
You're under the gun, Mike.

823
01:03:55,765 --> 01:03:58,598
- From you?
- Message from the chief.

824
01:03:58,701 --> 01:04:01,864
Your little pet project's
becoming a real epic saga.

825
01:04:01,971 --> 01:04:02,938
Really.

826
01:04:03,039 --> 01:04:05,269
Running up a big bill,
got nothing to show for it.

827
01:04:05,374 --> 01:04:08,810
Then we got these dead Russians,
not to mention your boy on the inside.

828
01:04:08,911 --> 01:04:10,242
what about him?

829
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:13,338
I.A.'s been asking questions
about his conduct.

830
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:15,644
I mean, look at the way he's dressing.

831
01:04:15,751 --> 01:04:17,776
Look, Lieutenant, I vouch for him.

832
01:04:17,887 --> 01:04:21,618
Jesus Himself could vouch for him.
You know what it's gonna be with I. A...

833
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:25,524
"What are we doing? Hosting this guy's
long booze and broad party?"

834
01:04:25,628 --> 01:04:28,893
It's just a matter of one break.
He's high and tight with Troiano.

835
01:04:28,998 --> 01:04:31,831
Tell your boss that he took him
to a meeting with Allie Boy.

836
01:04:31,934 --> 01:04:34,061
Now, that establishes a connection.

837
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:35,865
We're getting close.

838
01:04:35,972 --> 01:04:38,702
I understand, Mike,
but you're not getting the message.

839
01:04:39,308 --> 01:04:42,709
You're running out of time.
This thing dries up, it falls on you.

840
01:04:42,812 --> 01:04:43,779
I know that.

841
01:04:43,880 --> 01:04:46,678
Your proposal, your project,
your responsibility.

842
01:04:46,782 --> 01:04:49,012
If your boy ends up
on the wrong side of I.A.,

843
01:04:49,118 --> 01:04:50,585
that's gonna come to you too.

844
01:04:53,256 --> 01:04:56,089
You need to press it
or pull your man out.

845
01:05:03,532 --> 01:05:06,660
<i>Christ, Andy, you are not
helping the Miami P.D.</i>

846
01:05:06,769 --> 01:05:09,829
Or the Feds dressing like
Calvin Klein here.

847
01:05:09,939 --> 01:05:11,031
Not to mention I.A.

848
01:05:11,140 --> 01:05:14,632
Come on, Mike, Chris wants me
to fit in with the people we deal with.

849
01:05:14,744 --> 01:05:18,612
Like the dead Russians in the BMw...
is that what you call fitting in?

850
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:20,238
What's that supposed to mean?

851
01:05:20,349 --> 01:05:23,182
It means this: I put a guy's picture
on a bulletin board,

852
01:05:23,286 --> 01:05:26,278
he's nobody to me...
he's a bad guy, fine, I nail him.

853
01:05:26,389 --> 01:05:30,223
I gotta spend some time with him...
interrogation, courthouse, this, that...

854
01:05:30,326 --> 01:05:33,591
I wind up saying, "It's a shame
the guy's a hood. He's good company. "

855
01:05:33,696 --> 01:05:35,755
I'm not spending every day
with him like you.

856
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:39,392
- You know what I'm sayin'?
- No. I don't have a clue.

857
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:42,266
I mean, he's no picture
on a bulletin board to you, Andy.

858
01:05:42,371 --> 01:05:46,000
He's a real flesh-and-blood guy,
and that can be dangerous.

859
01:05:46,108 --> 01:05:49,475
- Are they asking questions about me?
- The question has come up.

860
01:05:49,578 --> 01:05:51,739
They wonder if you're
getting too involved.

861
01:05:51,847 --> 01:05:53,144
Once the case is made,

862
01:05:53,249 --> 01:05:56,980
it's good night to the amazing girls
every night at the club, the nice clothes...

863
01:05:57,086 --> 01:05:58,917
once the bust comes, the party's over.

864
01:05:59,021 --> 01:06:02,422
The party's my job!
I can handle this thing.

865
01:06:02,525 --> 01:06:05,289
I believe you.
But we're out of time, Andy.

866
01:06:07,096 --> 01:06:10,361
Your boy Troiano, he's about
to have a meltdown any minute.

867
01:06:10,933 --> 01:06:11,900
Why?

868
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:14,595
Well, you remember Davey Harris?

869
01:06:15,638 --> 01:06:19,233
- Yeah, the Russians mentioned him.
- He's an old friend of Chris.

870
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:21,867
He just got pinched for
drug conspiracy and murder.

871
01:06:21,978 --> 01:06:23,343
He's facing a long time.

872
01:06:23,446 --> 01:06:26,006
And Chris used to run with
the Bath Avenue crew.

873
01:06:26,115 --> 01:06:27,742
"The Binger," they used to call him,

874
01:06:27,850 --> 01:06:31,684
because he did so many crimes...
bank stick-ups, drugs, hot cars...

875
01:06:31,787 --> 01:06:34,187
and maybe even a few murders
for the Allie Boy crew.

876
01:06:34,290 --> 01:06:36,224
According to some new information,

877
01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:40,762
Harris was involved in a homicide
of a Russian housewife a few years ago.

878
01:06:40,863 --> 01:06:43,354
Marina Petrov. Late wife...

879
01:06:43,466 --> 01:06:45,798
- Slava Petrov, yeah.
- Right.

880
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:47,368
Jesus.

881
01:06:47,470 --> 01:06:50,598
That's why Allie Boy whacked out
the two Russians, then.

882
01:06:50,706 --> 01:06:53,004
The Russians were getting close
to their golden goose,

883
01:06:53,109 --> 01:06:54,440
so Allie Boy had 'em whacked

884
01:06:54,543 --> 01:06:57,137
to protect the money laundering
going through the club.

885
01:06:58,314 --> 01:07:00,612
Look, Andy,
I want you to take this.

886
01:07:02,618 --> 01:07:03,607
Take it.

887
01:07:04,653 --> 01:07:06,450
What, do they want me
to wear a wire?

888
01:07:06,555 --> 01:07:09,888
- They're ready to pull the plug.
- Oh, Mike. Jesus.

889
01:07:09,992 --> 01:07:12,119
The Feds are asking
what we're waiting for,

890
01:07:12,228 --> 01:07:14,389
I.A.'s circling like vultures.

891
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:16,328
They're all wondering
what we're doing here.

892
01:07:17,566 --> 01:07:19,500
They think I'm holding out?

893
01:07:19,602 --> 01:07:21,661
If Davey Harris rolled
and that's enough...

894
01:07:21,771 --> 01:07:25,730
It's not enough, not with Davey's record.
Nobody's corroborating his story.

895
01:07:27,476 --> 01:07:31,378
Look, whatever Troiano does,
I need it on tape, now.

896
01:07:31,480 --> 01:07:32,947
And I'm not asking.

897
01:07:45,961 --> 01:07:48,429
They picked up your friend
Davey Harris in a sweep.

898
01:07:48,531 --> 01:07:50,089
That's tough luck for Davey.

899
01:07:54,470 --> 01:07:56,529
<i>It doesn't look good
for you, either.</i>

900
01:07:56,639 --> 01:07:58,470
What do you mean by that?

901
01:07:58,574 --> 01:07:59,700
You knew him a long time.

902
01:07:59,809 --> 01:08:02,141
You did things
with this Davey, am I right?

903
01:08:02,244 --> 01:08:04,371
- A long time ago.
- It doesn't matter.

904
01:08:04,480 --> 01:08:05,970
They have him on a conspiracy case

905
01:08:06,082 --> 01:08:08,107
and that shooting
from a long time ago.

906
01:08:08,217 --> 01:08:10,549
He's looking at 25 years to life.

907
01:08:12,354 --> 01:08:14,686
<i>So you figure at some point
he's going to talk,</i>

908
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:16,883
<i>and then they come looking for you.</i>

909
01:08:16,992 --> 01:08:18,926
You think Davey's gonna roll?

910
01:08:19,962 --> 01:08:21,020
He's 35 years old.

911
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:24,361
He's facing the rest of his life in prison
with no possibility of parole.

912
01:08:24,467 --> 01:08:25,434
You tell me.

913
01:08:25,534 --> 01:08:30,471
Look, what if I get word to him...
I pay him to keep his mouth shut.

914
01:08:30,573 --> 01:08:32,939
The minute he says a word,
no more paychecks.

915
01:08:33,042 --> 01:08:35,670
The guy's got a family,
and it's worked in the past.

916
01:08:35,778 --> 01:08:38,440
Sure, for 18 months,
even five years,

917
01:08:38,547 --> 01:08:40,538
but not life with no parole.

918
01:08:40,649 --> 01:08:43,777
Maybe he doesn't like
all the success you have in Miami.

919
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:45,911
- So what? That's my problem.
- Yes, it is.

920
01:08:46,021 --> 01:08:49,013
But your problem could become
our friend's problem very quickly.

921
01:08:49,959 --> 01:08:53,019
You know what?
You don't need to lay this out for me.

922
01:08:53,129 --> 01:08:54,596
It ain't gonna happen.

923
01:08:54,697 --> 01:08:56,187
I hope not.

924
01:08:57,266 --> 01:08:59,393
You have a lot of friends, Chris.

925
01:08:59,502 --> 01:09:01,129
I'd hate to see you closed down.

926
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:05,899
Yeah? You'd hate to see
the suitcases stop?

927
01:09:06,008 --> 01:09:07,669
No one can deny that.

928
01:09:08,677 --> 01:09:10,975
But whether the suitcases
are there or not...

929
01:09:13,916 --> 01:09:16,817
We will take care of you,
Christopher.

930
01:09:25,427 --> 01:09:26,587
Go, go, go!

931
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:30,258
- what?
- Come on!

932
01:10:40,169 --> 01:10:42,603
Hey. I'm glad you're still here.
Let's go for a ride.

933
01:10:42,705 --> 01:10:45,003
- Where we goin'?
- I'll tell you in the car.

934
01:10:45,107 --> 01:10:46,074
Come on.

935
01:10:53,649 --> 01:10:56,049
That little blood-sucking scumbag.

936
01:10:56,151 --> 01:10:57,618
After everything I did for him?

937
01:10:57,720 --> 01:11:01,451
I brought him down here.
I gave him a life, some dignity.

938
01:11:01,557 --> 01:11:05,425
He was making money hand over fist,
and he does this to me?

939
01:11:05,527 --> 01:11:08,052
- What did he do?
- Danny Hayes never went back home.

940
01:11:08,163 --> 01:11:10,893
He got a backer, and he's gonna
open up some new megaclub

941
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,365
right down the block from us.

942
01:11:12,468 --> 01:11:13,696
So what?

943
01:11:13,802 --> 01:11:15,667
I want to tear
his tongue out, so what!

944
01:11:15,771 --> 01:11:17,966
I want to whack him so bad
my teeth hurt.

945
01:11:19,575 --> 01:11:22,305
Chris, you gotta use your head
right now, okay?

946
01:11:22,411 --> 01:11:24,879
You got a good thing
going down here.

947
01:11:24,980 --> 01:11:27,813
You go doing something crazy,
you're gonna mess everything up.

948
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:30,244
I got a job to do.

949
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:32,820
You with me or not?

950
01:11:36,492 --> 01:11:37,459
You in or out?

951
01:11:38,861 --> 01:11:40,556
I'm here, ain't I?

952
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:47,058
- Have you got a plan?
- Yeah. I'm gonna go to the front door.

953
01:11:47,169 --> 01:11:50,138
I'm gonna pound on it, and I'm gonna
put the fear of God into him.

954
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:53,003
He's gonna run out the back,
where you grab him.

955
01:11:53,108 --> 01:11:53,972
I grab him.

956
01:11:54,076 --> 01:11:56,306
What do you want me to do
when I grab him?

957
01:11:56,412 --> 01:11:58,607
You grab him,
I bop him on the head,

958
01:11:58,714 --> 01:12:01,410
We roll him up in a rug,
go feed him to the gators.

959
01:12:06,322 --> 01:12:10,053
Chris, you're talking about risking
spending the rest of your life

960
01:12:10,159 --> 01:12:12,286
in a Florida prison
over this piece of crap?

961
01:12:12,394 --> 01:12:15,761
- That's what you want to do?
- There ain't gonna be any body.

962
01:12:15,864 --> 01:12:16,956
Okay?

963
01:12:19,601 --> 01:12:22,331
- You goin' soft on me?
- I'm not going soft on you.

964
01:12:22,438 --> 01:12:25,236
Just don't go shooting up
the neighborhood like wyatt Earp.

965
01:12:25,341 --> 01:12:26,933
Nobody's shooting anybody.

966
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:30,034
We hit him over the head,
we dump him, we're done with it.

967
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:33,441
All right.

968
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:36,507
This is the street right up here.

969
01:12:52,534 --> 01:12:53,501
Hey.

970
01:12:54,536 --> 01:12:56,436
What are you waiting for?

971
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:58,165
Let's go, let's do this.

972
01:13:04,580 --> 01:13:05,945
Go around back.

973
01:13:08,484 --> 01:13:09,678
Hurry up.

974
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:14,817
Hey, Danny!

975
01:13:14,923 --> 01:13:17,551
Danny, come on out!
we need to talk!

976
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:23,124
Come on! Danny!

977
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:24,824
Open up!

978
01:13:27,936 --> 01:13:29,927
Danny, come on, open up!
It's me!

979
01:13:31,473 --> 01:13:33,270
Come on! Come on!

980
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:42,943
Come on, Andy.

981
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:45,519
I'm sorry, man.
I didn't mean to cross him.

982
01:13:45,621 --> 01:13:47,521
Please. Please, no.

983
01:13:49,825 --> 01:13:52,692
Hey! Danny! Open the door!

984
01:14:01,136 --> 01:14:03,104
Hey. Did you get him?

985
01:14:03,205 --> 01:14:06,663
- Uh, no, he went over the fence.
- what do you mean no?

986
01:14:06,775 --> 01:14:09,938
I came around the corner,
he barreled into me with this gate...

987
01:14:10,045 --> 01:14:11,808
Are you kidding me?

988
01:14:11,914 --> 01:14:14,178
- You screwed up!
- what do you mean I screwed up?

989
01:14:14,283 --> 01:14:17,150
Let's go. we don't have time for this.

990
01:14:19,721 --> 01:14:21,018
You should have had him.

991
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:24,251
You should have waited to knock
until I got back there.

992
01:14:24,359 --> 01:14:26,350
I was counting on you to get him.

993
01:14:26,462 --> 01:14:29,590
Count on yourself next time.
You grab him and I'll knock.

994
01:14:29,698 --> 01:14:31,757
You would've screwed that up too.

995
01:14:36,071 --> 01:14:37,698
Where do you think he went?

996
01:14:37,806 --> 01:14:40,331
You just forget about him for now.

997
01:14:47,716 --> 01:14:49,581
Look, I'm sorry about, you know...

998
01:14:50,752 --> 01:14:53,152
That's all right. It happens.

999
01:14:53,255 --> 01:14:54,620
What's done is done.

1000
01:14:55,757 --> 01:14:59,853
- I'm gonna head home.
- what do you say we take a little dip?

1001
01:15:07,102 --> 01:15:09,366
I can't swim. Remember?

1002
01:15:09,471 --> 01:15:11,268
You don't have to swim.

1003
01:15:12,407 --> 01:15:15,069
You could just stand
in the shallow end.

1004
01:15:15,177 --> 01:15:17,008
Feel the water. It's nice.

1005
01:15:19,548 --> 01:15:21,015
Go ahead. Go ahead.

1006
01:15:23,986 --> 01:15:25,817
Come on,
what are you waiting for?

1007
01:15:28,223 --> 01:15:30,384
Look, I'm sorry about what happened.

1008
01:15:30,492 --> 01:15:32,221
I just want to go home, all right?

1009
01:15:33,295 --> 01:15:35,058
You're not gonna go in?

1010
01:15:36,932 --> 01:15:38,627
You're not gonna go in the pool?

1011
01:15:40,469 --> 01:15:41,868
I'm not going in.

1012
01:15:42,604 --> 01:15:43,662
Why not?

1013
01:15:58,854 --> 01:15:59,980
What?

1014
01:16:00,088 --> 01:16:01,521
What are you looking for?

1015
01:16:03,325 --> 01:16:04,519
Huh?

1016
01:16:05,427 --> 01:16:06,689
What?

1017
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:08,262
Think I'm a rat?

1018
01:16:10,966 --> 01:16:12,763
You think I'm a rat?

1019
01:16:14,202 --> 01:16:16,466
- Satisfied?
- Put your clothes back on.

1020
01:16:20,108 --> 01:16:21,939
Now I'm going home.

1021
01:16:26,081 --> 01:16:27,378
This is bullshit.

1022
01:16:58,013 --> 01:17:01,471
<i>...then we roll him up in a rug,
go feed him to the gators.</i>

1023
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:19,767
<i>Danny Hayes never went back home.</i>

1024
01:17:19,868 --> 01:17:22,666
<i>He got a backer, and he's gonna
open up some new megaclub</i>

1025
01:17:22,771 --> 01:17:24,671
<i>right down the block from us.</i>

1026
01:17:24,773 --> 01:17:27,469
<i>So what? I want to tear
his tongue out, so what!</i>

1027
01:17:29,044 --> 01:17:32,844
<i>I got a job to do.
You with me or not?</i>

1028
01:17:34,316 --> 01:17:35,544
<i>Look, I'm here, ain't I?</i>

1029
01:17:37,452 --> 01:17:40,649
<i>...spending the rest of your life
in a Florida prison over this?</i>

1030
01:17:40,756 --> 01:17:42,485
<i>There ain't gonna be any body.</i>

1031
01:18:07,516 --> 01:18:09,040
The mayor's office just called.

1032
01:18:09,151 --> 01:18:11,312
You're being named
Businessman of the Year.

1033
01:18:11,420 --> 01:18:13,786
Plaque's coming later,
along with the photo op.

1034
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:16,050
- All right.
- So get ready.

1035
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:17,125
Thanks.

1036
01:18:22,297 --> 01:18:24,288
- Any word on Danny yet?
- No.

1037
01:18:24,399 --> 01:18:26,026
You want I should go look for him?

1038
01:18:27,135 --> 01:18:28,568
No, that's all right.

1039
01:18:29,771 --> 01:18:31,966
I was just a little hot
last night, that's all.

1040
01:18:32,074 --> 01:18:36,010
Yeah? It's probably a good thing
he got away, then.

1041
01:18:36,111 --> 01:18:37,078
Yeah.

1042
01:18:41,483 --> 01:18:43,041
Kick this door down!

1043
01:18:43,151 --> 01:18:44,209
Double-time! Move!

1044
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:45,843
Get the door!

1045
01:18:47,923 --> 01:18:50,551
<i>Chris Troiano,
this is the Miami police!</i>

1046
01:18:50,659 --> 01:18:53,526
<i>- we have a warrant for your arrest!
- It's the cops!</i>

1047
01:18:55,464 --> 01:18:57,056
Go, go, go!

1048
01:18:57,165 --> 01:18:58,063
Come on, let's go!

1049
01:18:58,166 --> 01:19:01,192
- Stay with Andy!
- what the hell's going on?

1050
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:04,397
Everybody on the floor!
Get down! Get down!

1051
01:19:07,776 --> 01:19:10,438
Put your hands on the rail.
Put your hands on the rail.

1052
01:19:24,659 --> 01:19:25,626
Cuff him!

1053
01:19:26,661 --> 01:19:28,891
Get off me!

1054
01:19:28,997 --> 01:19:31,227
He's a cop. I said he's a cop.
He's on the job.

1055
01:19:31,333 --> 01:19:33,301
- Now let him up.
- Andy!

1056
01:19:34,503 --> 01:19:36,903
I read you. Continue pursuit.

1057
01:19:37,005 --> 01:19:38,802
- Spread your feet.
- I'm clean.

1058
01:19:50,285 --> 01:19:51,582
I said I'm clean.

1059
01:19:54,456 --> 01:19:55,423
She is.

1060
01:19:59,261 --> 01:20:02,355
He was your friend, Andy.
How the hell could you hurt him?

1061
01:20:02,464 --> 01:20:05,695
Hey, you knew
he was dirty all along.

1062
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:08,668
You just be glad the Feds
aren't bringing you down too.

1063
01:20:32,861 --> 01:20:34,954
So, we gonna get Allie Boy out of this?

1064
01:20:35,063 --> 01:20:37,429
When Allie Boy was released
a few years ago,

1065
01:20:37,532 --> 01:20:39,466
he was not allowed to carry weapons.

1066
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:41,092
<i>Go check out his boat.</i>

1067
01:20:41,203 --> 01:20:43,501
<i>This is the FBI. we have a warrant.</i>

1068
01:20:43,605 --> 01:20:45,402
You gotta be kiddin' me.

1069
01:20:45,507 --> 01:20:47,634
<i>Anyone below deck
come up on top...</i>

1070
01:20:47,742 --> 01:20:51,803
<i>He keeps a 12-gauge Mossberg shotgun
above the cabin door of his boat.</i>

1071
01:20:51,913 --> 01:20:55,041
<i>He's gonna say it's not his
and the captain uses it against pirates.</i>

1072
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:57,550
<i>It's enough to hold him
until we get Troiano to cooperate</i>

1073
01:20:57,652 --> 01:20:59,517
<i>and the other charges fall into place.</i>

1074
01:21:33,555 --> 01:21:35,386
He's southbound on Fifth!

1075
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:13,859
Put your hands in the air!

1076
01:22:17,065 --> 01:22:18,362
Hands in the air!

1077
01:22:41,957 --> 01:22:46,451
<i>All the guys on your old crew,
they're turning...</i>

1078
01:22:46,561 --> 01:22:49,359
- He's giving Glaser nothing.
- I'm not surprised.

1079
01:22:49,464 --> 01:22:52,797
<i>You better understand one thing...
Liquid is finished.</i>

1080
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:55,802
<i>- You are finished.
- He's not gonna talk to him.</i>

1081
01:22:57,005 --> 01:22:58,666
Then can you do something?

1082
01:22:58,773 --> 01:23:00,331
<i>You think that's funny, huh?</i>

1083
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,572
<i>You better talk to me, pal.</i>

1084
01:23:06,681 --> 01:23:09,673
<i>In ten minutes, that's it.
Now, how does...</i>

1085
01:23:09,784 --> 01:23:12,378
...Allie Boy connect to the money
you run through the club?

1086
01:23:27,268 --> 01:23:28,394
How ya doin', Chris?

1087
01:23:33,241 --> 01:23:35,004
That what you'd normally wear?

1088
01:23:36,177 --> 01:23:37,303
Sometimes.

1089
01:23:40,348 --> 01:23:43,317
Burnett. That really your name?

1090
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:45,818
Maybe it is, maybe it isn't.

1091
01:23:45,920 --> 01:23:48,650
Troiano's not your last name.

1092
01:23:48,757 --> 01:23:50,224
It's wentz, right?

1093
01:23:50,325 --> 01:23:53,590
That's my mother's maiden name.
They're both my names.

1094
01:23:56,464 --> 01:23:59,297
Let me ask you a question.
why? why me?

1095
01:24:00,435 --> 01:24:02,767
You spend all this time with me
to bust my balls?

1096
01:24:02,871 --> 01:24:05,339
You know I'm not
the worst piece of shit out there.

1097
01:24:05,440 --> 01:24:08,136
- Why you pricks pick me?
- It's pretty simple, Chris.

1098
01:24:08,243 --> 01:24:11,007
- You're a street kid from Bath Beach.
- So what?

1099
01:24:11,112 --> 01:24:13,842
You're gonna come down here
and become the biggest thing

1100
01:24:13,948 --> 01:24:16,143
on South Beach and nobody's
gonna suspect nothin'?

1101
01:24:16,251 --> 01:24:17,946
where you gonna get
that kind of cash?

1102
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:21,216
- You had to be a front for somebody.
- I saved my pennies.

1103
01:24:21,322 --> 01:24:23,586
We opened the case
so we could find out

1104
01:24:23,691 --> 01:24:25,181
Where those pennies came from.

1105
01:24:25,293 --> 01:24:28,524
And you found out that I wasn't
a front for anybody but myself.

1106
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:30,097
Yeah.

1107
01:24:30,198 --> 01:24:32,632
I actually told my bosses that
for a long time.

1108
01:24:32,734 --> 01:24:35,635
I told 'em so many times
they thought I was going native.

1109
01:24:35,737 --> 01:24:38,001
Maybe you should have
so you could hold your head up

1110
01:24:38,106 --> 01:24:39,971
instead of running around
like a little rat.

1111
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:42,976
Then we'd both be sitting here
facing life without parole.

1112
01:24:44,279 --> 01:24:46,975
I think even you're gonna
agree that it's a good thing

1113
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:49,107
to have a friend
on this side of the table.

1114
01:24:49,217 --> 01:24:52,186
A friend? You're not my friend.
This is bullshit.

1115
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:53,777
- You got nothin'.
- I got nothin'?

1116
01:24:53,888 --> 01:24:55,822
I got you taking me on Allie Boy's boat.

1117
01:24:55,924 --> 01:24:58,825
I got you on tape taking me
to Danny Hayes's house

1118
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:01,293
to whack him out, which is
conspiracy to commit murder.

1119
01:25:01,396 --> 01:25:03,557
- You want more?
- You don't got me on tape.

1120
01:25:03,665 --> 01:25:04,632
I checked you.

1121
01:25:04,732 --> 01:25:07,462
Chris... I got you on tape.

1122
01:25:08,570 --> 01:25:10,868
I haven't done anything.
I opened my own joint.

1123
01:25:10,972 --> 01:25:12,200
You opened your own joint

1124
01:25:12,307 --> 01:25:15,435
with the money from
the Petrov robbery, didn't you?

1125
01:25:15,543 --> 01:25:18,376
See, I figure Allie Boy
put you in on that score.

1126
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:20,675
Slava Petrov's a bank
for the Russian mob.

1127
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:23,216
You take him down,
you get your wad of cash.

1128
01:25:23,318 --> 01:25:25,183
You take that cash,
you open up Risk.

1129
01:25:25,286 --> 01:25:29,086
Then Allie Boy torches the joint for you,
and boom! Liquid is born.

1130
01:25:29,190 --> 01:25:31,954
But there's a problem
with that, isn't there?

1131
01:25:32,060 --> 01:25:35,223
You got a real problem, 'cause now
Allie Boy has got you into him

1132
01:25:35,330 --> 01:25:37,457
for always and forever.

1133
01:25:37,565 --> 01:25:39,123
Maybe he squeezes you sometimes,

1134
01:25:39,234 --> 01:25:41,099
busts your balls
with his Cuban goons.

1135
01:25:41,202 --> 01:25:43,261
Maybe he even asks you
to do his laundry.

1136
01:25:43,371 --> 01:25:45,066
Oh, come on! This is a joke!

1137
01:25:45,173 --> 01:25:47,266
This is a joke!
You can't prove anything!

1138
01:25:47,375 --> 01:25:49,639
Chris...

1139
01:25:49,744 --> 01:25:51,473
Davey Harris rolled.

1140
01:25:51,579 --> 01:25:52,637
All right?

1141
01:25:52,747 --> 01:25:55,978
He put you in on that
push-in homicide in New York.

1142
01:25:59,921 --> 01:26:01,718
He's a liar. I didn't kill anybody.

1143
01:26:01,823 --> 01:26:03,222
He never said you did.

1144
01:26:07,295 --> 01:26:08,728
Go, go, go!

1145
01:26:17,138 --> 01:26:18,662
<i>But he put you at the wheel.</i>

1146
01:26:18,773 --> 01:26:21,867
He put you at the wheel,
and in a robbery-homicide

1147
01:26:21,976 --> 01:26:24,137
that's as good as
pulling the trigger yourself.

1148
01:26:24,245 --> 01:26:26,805
Only you can help you now, Chris.

1149
01:26:26,915 --> 01:26:29,975
Oh, okay.
Now I'm supposed to flip?

1150
01:26:30,084 --> 01:26:31,517
That what you want?

1151
01:26:32,754 --> 01:26:34,051
It's your only chance.

1152
01:26:34,155 --> 01:26:36,146
I think you know me
better than that.

1153
01:26:36,257 --> 01:26:38,282
Who do you think
they're gonna believe...

1154
01:26:38,393 --> 01:26:42,989
a scumbag like Davey Harris,
or Businessman of the Year?

1155
01:26:43,097 --> 01:26:45,725
- I'll take my chances.
- what about Allie Boy?

1156
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:47,664
You gonna take your chances with him?

1157
01:26:49,671 --> 01:26:51,070
Think about it, Chris.

1158
01:26:51,172 --> 01:26:54,664
Allie Boy has killed some
of his oldest and closest friends

1159
01:26:54,776 --> 01:26:57,210
just on the chance
that they might betray him.

1160
01:26:57,312 --> 01:26:59,507
What possible chance do you have?

1161
01:26:59,614 --> 01:27:02,208
You plead, he can't be sure
you won't change your mind

1162
01:27:02,317 --> 01:27:04,012
after a few years...
plenty of guys do.

1163
01:27:04,118 --> 01:27:06,450
You plead not guilty,
he knows the prosecutor's

1164
01:27:06,554 --> 01:27:08,613
gonna drag him
into the middle of that case,

1165
01:27:08,723 --> 01:27:10,748
Which is good enough
to get you whacked.

1166
01:27:10,858 --> 01:27:13,258
And if you should beat the case...
which you won't...

1167
01:27:13,361 --> 01:27:15,192
he's gonna whack you
for being dumb enough

1168
01:27:15,296 --> 01:27:17,594
to bring a cop
onto his boat in the first place!

1169
01:27:19,467 --> 01:27:21,765
- Allie Boy's straight.
- Yeah?

1170
01:27:21,869 --> 01:27:23,029
He's straight, huh?

1171
01:27:23,137 --> 01:27:25,662
Let me tell you something, Chris.

1172
01:27:25,773 --> 01:27:27,400
To Allie Boy and his goons,

1173
01:27:27,508 --> 01:27:30,739
you are a punch line to a joke
that they're gonna tell over drinks.

1174
01:27:30,845 --> 01:27:33,837
You're the sucker that they
squeezed dry and let take the fall,

1175
01:27:33,948 --> 01:27:36,439
because that's
what suckers are good for.

1176
01:27:36,551 --> 01:27:38,746
They're the reason
that you're here right now.

1177
01:27:38,853 --> 01:27:41,686
If you go in the can for this,
they're gonna laugh about it

1178
01:27:41,789 --> 01:27:44,815
and hump all those pretty little
girlfriends of yours at the same time.

1179
01:27:53,968 --> 01:27:55,959
You're a good salesman, Andy.

1180
01:27:57,038 --> 01:27:58,505
I ain't sellin', Chris.

1181
01:27:59,974 --> 01:28:02,807
I'm offering you help
from this side of the table.

1182
01:28:04,545 --> 01:28:06,604
I still ain't buyin'.

1183
01:28:07,682 --> 01:28:08,910
Fine.

1184
01:28:15,123 --> 01:28:18,456
I really hate to see them guys
make a sucker out of you.

1185
01:28:33,508 --> 01:28:34,839
Well, you did sell it well.

1186
01:28:34,942 --> 01:28:36,807
