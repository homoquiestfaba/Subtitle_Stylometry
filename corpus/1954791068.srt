             - NO.
       - YOU'LL BE FINE.

         ALTERNATIVES?

33
00:01:31,859 --> 00:01:35,727
     - I'M NOT REALLY SURE
   WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT.

34
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:42,367
      - WELL, IN YOUR AD,
IT SAID THAT YOU COULD PRESCRIBE

      IN CASES OF ANXIETY.

      THAT'S A POSSIBILITY

38
00:01:47,808 --> 00:01:50,676
    THAT YOU THINK MIGHT BE
         GOOD FOR ME...

39
00:01:50,678 --> 00:01:51,610
        IN MY SITUATION?

40
00:01:51,612 --> 00:01:53,278
            - SURE.

41
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,314

       - AGGRESSIVE POUR.

151
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:47,639
           [laughter]

152
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,541
 - SWEETIE, DINNER WAS AWESOME.

153
00:06:49,543 --> 00:06:50,942
          - THANK YOU.
           - IT WAS.

154
00:06:50,944 --> 00:06:53,645
    - WERE THOSE TOFU DOGS?
          - TOFU DOGS.

155
00:06:53,647 --> 00:06:56,598
           - MM-HMM.

156
00:06:56,599 --> 00:06:59,550
       - ALL RIGHT, COOL.
I, UM...I HAVE AN ANNOUNCEMENT.

157
00:06:59,553 --> 00:07:04,523
    YOU GUYS KNOW HOW I EAT,
           OBVIOUSLY.

158
00:07:04,525 --> 00:07:05,991
  AND THAT'S ALSO HOW I THINK.

159
00:07:05,993 --> 00:07:10,662
I HAVE A VERY HOLISTIC ATTITUDE.

160
00:07:10,664 --> 00:07:14,966
       AND I'M CURRENTLY
      STARTING A BUSINESS.

161
00:07:14,968 --> 00:07:16,735
         THE COMPANY'S
      CALLED "FACE FOOD."

162
00:07:16,737 --> 00:07:18,570
    IT'S FOOD FOR YOUR FACE.

163
00:07:18,572 --> 00:07:23,175
       IT'S 100% ORGANIC
  AND WILD-HARVESTED AND RAW.

164
00:07:23,177 --> 00:07:24,827
   BASICALLY, THE BELIEF IS,

165
00:07:24,828 --> 00:07:26,478
 YOUR SKIN IS THE LARGEST ORGAN
         IN YOUR BODY,

166
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:29,047
      AND IT ABSORBS MORE
        THAN YOUR MOUTH,

167
00:07:29,049 --> 00:07:34,553
 SO WHY FEED IT TOXIC CHEMICALS
WHEN YOU CAN FEED IT FACE FOOD,

168
00:07:34,555 --> 00:07:40,759
  A TOTALLY HOLISTIC SKIN CARE
LINE THAT YOU CAN LITERALLY EAT?

169
00:07:40,761 --> 00:07:42,160
 FORGIVE ME FOR BEING SO BOLD,

170
00:07:42,162 --> 00:07:44,663
    BUT I KNOW THAT YOU BOTH
   ARE EXTREMELY SUCCESSFUL,

171
00:07:44,665 --> 00:07:49,134
AS I CAN SEE FROM YOUR BEAUTIFUL
       CHILDREN AS WELL.

172
00:07:49,136 --> 00:07:53,104
      I'M LOOKING FOR 100K
       AS AN INVESTMENT.

173
00:07:53,106 --> 00:07:54,840
         - TANK. TANK.

174
00:07:54,842 --> 00:07:57,742
   GUYS, THIS IS SO AWKWARD.
         - NO. NO. NO.

175
00:07:57,744 --> 00:08:00,011
- HE'S ASKING YOU FOR $100,000.

176
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,613
           - NO. NO.
       - LET THEM SPEAK.

177
00:08:01,615 --> 00:08:03,215
    - LOOK, WE GET IT A LOT.
     IT'S FINE. IT'S FINE.

178
00:08:03,217 --> 00:08:04,683
      - THANK YOU. LISTEN.

179
00:08:04,685 --> 00:08:06,818
     YOU GUYS CAN TAKE THAT
      AND READ THAT OVER.

180
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:11,122
LITERALLY, I JUST WROTE THIS ON
THE WAY OVER HERE, BUT I HAVE--

181
00:08:11,124 --> 00:08:12,224
       - SURE, MAN. SURE.

182
00:08:12,226 --> 00:08:13,959
          DEFINITELY.
       WE'LL TAKE A LOOK.

183
00:08:13,961 --> 00:08:16,127
             SURE.
            - YEAH.

184
00:08:16,129 --> 00:08:18,997
       [nervous laughter]

185
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,002
            - SHIT.

186
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,570
            - UM...

187
00:08:25,572 --> 00:08:29,007
             OKAY.

188
00:08:29,009 --> 00:08:31,643
I WAS LIKE, "AM I GONNA DO THIS?
    AM I NOT GONNA DO THIS?

189
00:08:31,645 --> 00:08:33,812
           YES? NO?"
           YES. OKAY.

190
00:08:35,582 --> 00:08:40,018
 ONE OF MY PROFESSORS AT SCHOOL
   RECOMMENDED ME FOR A JOB.

191
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:42,020
       - ARE YOU SERIOUS?
             - YAY.

192
00:08:42,022 --> 00:08:43,722
     - RIGHT ON. CONGRATS.
       - THAT'S AWESOME.

193
00:08:43,724 --> 00:08:45,724
            - YEAH.
            - NICE.

194
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:50,829
 - MY FINAL WRITING REQUIREMENT
   WAS CHOSEN TO BE PUBLISHED

195
00:08:50,831 --> 00:08:54,699
    IN A KIND OF PRESTIGIOUS
      HEALTH LAW JOURNAL.

196
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:57,769
      IT WAS LEGAL ISSUES
       RELATING TO AIDS,

197
00:08:57,771 --> 00:09:02,908
  AND HE GAVE IT TO THE POLICY
 AND GOVERNMENT RELATIONS STAFF

198
00:09:02,910 --> 00:09:04,242
        OVER AT MASSER.

199
00:09:04,244 --> 00:09:06,878
      THEY KNOW THEY HAVE
    A STRANGE PUBLIC IMAGE,

200
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:08,780
    SO THEY WANT TO GET MORE
    AIDS RESEARCH DOLLARS--

201
00:09:08,782 --> 00:09:10,248
  - WAIT, MASSER DRUG COMPANY?

202
00:09:10,250 --> 00:09:12,717
   - YEAH, BUT THE THING IS--

203
00:09:12,719 --> 00:09:15,587
     - BABY, WHEN WERE YOU
         GONNA TELL ME?

204
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:17,756
     - I'M TELLING YOU NOW.

205
00:09:17,758 --> 00:09:20,292
    LOOK, I WASN'T SURE WHEN
    THE RIGHT OCCASION WAS,

206
00:09:20,294 --> 00:09:22,294
  AND IT HAPPENED VERY FAST--

207
00:09:22,296 --> 00:09:23,695
   - WAIT. WAIT. WAIT. WAIT.

208
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:26,164
    CLOVER, SO YOU'RE GOING
      TO WORK FOR MASSER?

209
00:09:26,166 --> 00:09:29,568
     MASSER HAS NO INTEREST
        IN CURING AIDS.

210
00:09:29,570 --> 00:09:32,971
       THEY WANT TO KEEP
 PUSHING THEIR DRUGS ON PEOPLE.

211
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:36,741
       THIS IS BLOWING ME
    THE FUCK AWAY RIGHT NOW.

212
00:09:36,743 --> 00:09:39,044
    - THIS IS REALLY WEIRD.

213
00:09:39,046 --> 00:09:41,930
        - NO, IT'S NOT.

214
00:09:41,931 --> 00:09:44,815
  - YEAH, IT'S REALLY STRANGE
 FOR YOU TO BE TELLING<i> US</i> THIS,

215
00:09:44,818 --> 00:09:46,518
        DON'T YOU THINK?

216
00:09:46,519 --> 00:09:48,219
   - NO, BECAUSE I JUST WENT
    FOR MY SECOND INTERVIEW

217
00:09:48,221 --> 00:09:50,055
    WHERE THEY TALKED TO ME
   ABOUT IT, AND I WAS LIKE,

218
00:09:50,057 --> 00:09:51,590
  "OH, I'M GONNA TALK TO HIM."

219
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:53,725
      - DIDN'T HEAR ABOUT
     THAT FIRST INTERVIEW.

220
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:57,028
     - WE'RE TALKING 401K,
        LIFE INSURANCE,

221
00:09:57,030 --> 00:10:00,799
   THE BEST MEDICAL BENEFITS
      THAT MONEY CAN BUY.

222
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:03,735
      - RIGHT. YEAH. COOL.

223
00:10:03,737 --> 00:10:05,337
 SELL YOUR SOUL FOR SOME MONEY.

224
00:10:09,977 --> 00:10:12,777
- SOUNDS LIKE IT COULD BE GREAT.
           - I AGREE.

225
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:14,879
      I THINK IT'S GREAT.
         RIGHT, HONEY?

226
00:10:14,881 --> 00:10:17,115
        - YEAH, I THINK
       IT'S REALLY GREAT.

227
00:10:17,117 --> 00:10:18,183
            - YEAH.
          - THANK YOU.

228
00:10:18,185 --> 00:10:19,884
     - THIS IS SO STRANGE.

229
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:21,720
       IF YOU KNEW HER...

230
00:10:25,158 --> 00:10:28,259
   IF YOU KNEW HER, YOU WOULD
UNDERSTAND HOW STRANGE THIS IS.

231
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:43,808
        [alarm beeping]

232
00:11:08,702 --> 00:11:11,403
        - UH, REMEMBER,
 WE NEED ORGANIC BABY DIAPERS.

233
00:11:33,226 --> 00:11:35,360
           - [sighs]

234
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,896
        HOW ABOUT THAT?

235
00:11:37,898 --> 00:11:40,265
   HOW ABOUT THAT, ROCK STAR?

236
00:11:41,802 --> 00:11:42,801
       [knocking on door]

237
00:11:42,803 --> 00:11:44,703
WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT, KID?

238
00:11:44,705 --> 00:11:46,871
           EAST L.A.

239
00:11:46,873 --> 00:11:50,308
        ECHO PARK. HEY.

240
00:11:50,310 --> 00:11:52,744
            - HELLO.

241
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,379
       - HELLO, ALLISON.
          - HI, HONEY.

242
00:11:54,381 --> 00:11:56,114
   - HOW YOU DOING, DARLIN'?

243
00:11:56,116 --> 00:11:58,316
          - [fussing]

244
00:11:58,318 --> 00:11:59,918
      - I'M GONNA PASS HER
          OVER TO YOU.

245
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:01,753
     I GOT TO GET TO WORK.

246
00:12:01,755 --> 00:12:03,121
           - [crying]

247
00:12:03,123 --> 00:12:05,457
         - BABY CAKES.
  - THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING.

248
00:13:01,948 --> 00:13:04,883
        [phone ringing]

249
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:05,884
            - HELLO.

250
00:13:05,886 --> 00:13:07,218
   - HI, RADKO, IT'S LONNIE.

251
00:13:07,220 --> 00:13:08,920
         - WHAT ARE YOU
       CALLING ABOUT NOW?

252
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:11,956
  - I DON'T THINK I'M GONNA BE
   ABLE TO MAKE IT IN TODAY.

253
00:13:11,958 --> 00:13:14,125
     - OH, GOD. NOT AGAIN.
           NOT AGAIN.

254
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,827
              WHY?
   WHY YOU CAN'T COME TODAY?

255
00:13:15,829 --> 00:13:16,928
              WHY?

256
00:13:16,930 --> 00:13:18,463
        - I'VE GOT SOME
     FAMILY STUFF GOING ON

257
00:13:18,465 --> 00:13:20,899
THAT I'M GONNA HAVE TO TAKE CARE
 OF, BUT I WILL BE IN TOMORROW.

258
00:13:20,901 --> 00:13:22,567
    - WHAT THE FUCK'S WRONG
       WITH YOUR DISEASE?

259
00:13:22,569 --> 00:13:24,369
         WHAT'S WRONG?
 WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOUR FAMILY?

260
00:13:24,371 --> 00:13:25,970
   - RADKO, PLEASE JUST STOP
         YELLING AT ME.

261
00:13:25,972 --> 00:13:28,106
  - YOU'RE TORMENTING MY ASS!
   THAT'S WHAT YOU'RE DOING!

262
00:13:28,108 --> 00:13:30,041
- I JUST--REMEMBER MY DAUGHTER?
       - SHE WORKS HERE?

263
00:13:30,043 --> 00:13:31,576
    THEN I DON'T GIVE A SHIT
      ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER!

264
00:13:31,578 --> 00:13:33,178
        - SHE'S FEELING
       REALLY ILL TODAY,

265
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,113
   AND WE'VE GOT TO TAKE HER
       INTO THE HOSPITAL.

266
00:13:35,115 --> 00:13:36,447
  - ARE YOU FUCKING DEAF NOW?

267
00:13:36,449 --> 00:13:37,849
   YOU HAVE WAX UP YOUR ASS?

268
00:13:37,851 --> 00:13:39,951
    - OKAY, JUST LET ME TALK
         FOR A SECOND.

269
00:13:39,953 --> 00:13:43,221
  I'M GONNA TAKE CARE OF HER.
I'M GONNA MAKE SURE SHE'S OKAY.

270
00:13:43,223 --> 00:13:45,323
  I WILL BE THERE FIRST THING
       TOMORROW MORNING.

271
00:13:45,325 --> 00:13:48,593
    - OH. COME IN TOMORROW.
           TOMORROW!

272
00:13:48,595 --> 00:13:50,128
    AND DON'T TELL ME ABOUT
         YOUR DAUGHTER.

273
00:13:50,130 --> 00:13:51,930
      I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
      ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER.

274
00:13:51,932 --> 00:13:53,265
            - OKAY.

275
00:13:53,266 --> 00:13:54,599
  - OKAY, LOOK, I'D BETTER GO.
       I HAVE WORK TO DO.

276
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:55,867
      - THANK YOU, RADKO.

277
00:14:10,383 --> 00:14:12,383
 THESE HASH BROWNS ARE AMAZING.

278
00:14:19,893 --> 00:14:23,061
 - YOU KNOW A THREE-LETTER WORD
        FOR "DISTANCE,"

279
00:14:23,063 --> 00:14:24,596
      STARTS WITH AN "F"?

280
00:14:28,068 --> 00:14:29,133
            - "FAR"?

281
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,467
            [grunts]

282
00:15:08,575 --> 00:15:10,642
       [knocking on door]

283
00:15:12,245 --> 00:15:13,978
            YO. OH.
       - WHAT'S UP, MAN?

284
00:15:13,980 --> 00:15:15,113
       - WHAT YOU DOING?

285
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:17,415
          - RELAXING.
          - RIGHT ON.

286
00:15:17,417 --> 00:15:19,918
      - I THOUGHT WE WERE
   GETTING TOGETHER THURSDAY.

287
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:22,921
 - OH, YEAH, NO, WE WERE, BUT--

288
00:15:22,923 --> 00:15:24,773
   SHIT, THE FUNNIEST THING.

289
00:15:24,774 --> 00:15:26,624
     I WENT INTO WORK TODAY
      AND STARTED WORKING,

290
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:29,961
   AND THE T1 LINE WENT DOWN.

291
00:15:29,963 --> 00:15:31,313
   WE'RE, LIKE, A, YOU KNOW--

292
00:15:31,314 --> 00:15:32,664
     WE'RE, LIKE, A FUCKING
    RENDER FARM OVER THERE.

293
00:15:32,666 --> 00:15:35,533
THE T1 LINE GOES DOWN, AND THEN
  WE CAN'T SEND ANYTHING OUT,

294
00:15:35,535 --> 00:15:37,602
 AND, YOU KNOW, WORK JUST KIND
   OF GRINDS TO A STANDSTILL,

295
00:15:37,604 --> 00:15:41,306
         SO RADKO SAID,
    "YOU GUYS CAN GO," SO--

296
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:45,710

     I WAS TALKING TO HIM,

435

    IT'S SO IMPORTANT FOR ME

     AND YOU WERE JUST OFF
     TO THE SIDE PAINTING,

    BY WHAT WE WERE PLAYING,

622
00:32:28,480 --> 00:32:30,948

   INSPIRED BY YOUR PAINTING,

627
00:32:39,124 --> 00:32:42,092

I'VE GOT TO TELL YOU SOMETHING.

907
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:20,182
     AFTER WE HAD OUR FIGHT
       THE OTHER NIGHT...

908
00:50:20,184 --> 00:50:23,152
           - MM-HMM.

             UM...

  MAKING A CAREER CHANGE TOO.

00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:53,215
           - MM-HMM.

        - LIKE, I FIGURE

00:51:13,771 --> 00:51:15,538
 I SHOULD BE MORE RESPONSIBLE.

924
00:51:16,641 --> 00:51:18,074

1046
01:00:57,121 --> 01:00:58,720
              OH.
              HEY.

1047
01:00:58,722 --> 01:01:01,890
       HOW WAS YOUR DAY?

1048
01:01:01,892 --> 01:01:03,225
      - IT WAS ALL RIGHT.

1049
01:01:03,227 --> 01:01:05,694
    - YOUR FACE LOOKS GREAT.

1050
01:01:05,696 --> 01:01:08,063
             UM...

1051
01:01:08,065 --> 01:01:12,000
    DO YOU WANT TO MAYBE GO
  GET SOME PIZZA OR SOMETHING?

1052
01:01:12,002 --> 01:01:14,803
            - YEAH.

1053
01:01:14,805 --> 01:01:16,238
    LET ME GET OUT OF THIS.

1054
01:01:16,240 --> 01:01:17,305
            - OKAY.

1055
01:01:24,848 --> 01:01:26,748
            [sighs]

1056
01:01:26,750 --> 01:01:30,752
        AH, LITTLE GIRL.

1057
01:01:30,754 --> 01:01:33,155
         HEY, COME ON.
            COME ON.

1058
01:01:33,157 --> 01:01:35,323
     IT'S BETTER OUT HERE.

1059
01:01:35,325 --> 01:01:37,259
     IT'S BETTER OUT HERE.

1060
01:01:37,261 --> 01:01:40,328
        [phone ringing]

1061
01:01:42,066 --> 01:01:44,466
            - HELLO?

1062
01:01:44,468 --> 01:01:48,036
         HEY, JEANNIE.
         HOW YOU DOING?

1063
01:01:49,907 --> 01:01:52,441
        NO, XANA'S FINE.

1064
01:01:52,443 --> 01:01:57,179
    SHE'S OUT THERE PLAYING
         WITH HER DAD.

1065
01:01:57,181 --> 01:01:59,748
              OH.

1066
01:01:59,750 --> 01:02:02,918
     I MEAN, SHE COULD USE
         A FRESH DIAPER

1067
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:04,720
      JUDGING BY THE SMELL
         OF HER, BUT--

1068
01:02:04,722 --> 01:02:07,789
- OH, OH, I THINK THAT'S FOR ME.

1069
01:02:07,791 --> 01:02:09,758
    BABY, GIVE ME THE PHONE.

1070
01:02:18,135 --> 01:02:20,235
             - AH.

1071
01:02:20,237 --> 01:02:21,903
      THANK YOU, JEANNIE.

1072
01:02:29,446 --> 01:02:30,912
        - WHO WAS THAT?

1073
01:02:35,119 --> 01:02:37,185
        [laughing] WHAT?

1074
01:02:41,425 --> 01:02:46,261
             WHAT?

1075
01:02:46,263 --> 01:02:48,530
    OH, DUDE, I KNOW EXACTLY

1076
01:02:48,532 --> 01:02:51,166
    WHY YOU'RE LOOKING AT ME
       LIKE THAT, WHICH--

1077
01:02:51,168 --> 01:02:54,536
 OBVIOUSLY, I WOULD LOOK AT ME
 LIKE THAT TOO, BUT IT'S NOT--

1078
01:02:54,538 --> 01:02:56,271
          IT'S THAT--

1079
01:02:56,273 --> 01:02:58,306
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN I TOLD YOU,
      LIKE, SIX WEEKS AGO

1080
01:02:58,308 --> 01:03:04,012
   THAT TONY LOVETT, THE GUY
  FROM SFX, HE'D LOST HIS SON?

1081
01:03:04,014 --> 01:03:08,383
     DO YOU REMEMBER THAT?

1082
01:03:08,385 --> 01:03:10,085
             OKAY.

1083
01:03:10,087 --> 01:03:12,821
  WELL, TONY LOST HIS TODDLER,

1084
01:03:12,823 --> 01:03:18,794
  AND WE TOOK UP A COLLECTION,
    AND I GAVE HIM 50 BUCKS.

1085
01:03:18,796 --> 01:03:21,296
       I KNOW I PROBABLY
  SHOULDN'T HAVE, BUT I JUST--

1086
01:03:21,298 --> 01:03:25,500
   I WAS THINKING ABOUT XANA,
 AND I WAS THINKING, YOU KNOW,

1087
01:03:25,502 --> 01:03:28,537
     IF IT HAPPENED TO US,
         JESUS CHRIST,

1088
01:03:28,539 --> 01:03:32,007
  SO MY NAME WAS ON THIS LOG,

1089
01:03:32,009 --> 01:03:35,544
 AND THERE WAS A SEPARATE KIND
   OF DONATION SHEET FOR HIM,

1090
01:03:35,546 --> 01:03:38,146
     AND JEANNIE SAW THAT,

1091
01:03:38,148 --> 01:03:40,582
   AND THEN SHE THOUGHT THAT
  SOMETHING HAD HAPPENED TO US

1092
01:03:40,584 --> 01:03:42,818
          AND TO XANA,

1093
01:03:42,820 --> 01:03:44,519
        AND THAT'S WHY--

1094
01:03:44,521 --> 01:03:48,824
  THAT WAS WHEN SHE CAME OVER
        WITH THE QUICHE.

1095
01:03:48,826 --> 01:03:50,525
   SHE THOUGHT THAT WHERE WAS

1096
01:03:50,527 --> 01:03:53,862
   THIS WHOLE OTHER SITUATION
      WHICH NEVER EXISTED.

1097
01:03:53,864 --> 01:03:56,231
             WHAT?

1098
01:03:56,233 --> 01:04:00,869
     I'M EXPLAINING TO YOU
         WHAT HAPPENED.

1099
01:04:00,871 --> 01:04:03,205
       I'M TELLING YOU--

1100
01:04:06,310 --> 01:04:07,943
         YOU DON'T BE--

1101
01:04:19,857 --> 01:04:21,056
      - WHERE'S THE MONEY?

1102
01:04:27,564 --> 01:04:30,999
       WHERE'S THE MONEY?

1103
01:05:26,423 --> 01:05:27,489
            GET OUT.

1104
01:05:44,274 --> 01:05:46,374
          [door opens]

1105
01:05:46,376 --> 01:05:47,442
         [door closes]

1106
01:06:24,548 --> 01:06:26,047
            - UM...

1107
01:06:42,265 --> 01:06:43,365
          - SIT DOWN.

1108
01:07:31,181 --> 01:07:32,680
        WHAT DID YOU DO?

1109
01:07:36,787 --> 01:07:39,754
       - DOES IT MATTER?

1110
01:07:39,756 --> 01:07:42,590
             - YES.

1111
01:07:46,696 --> 01:07:48,563
             - I...

1112
01:07:54,271 --> 01:07:57,439
     I WOKE UP THE MORNING

1113
01:07:57,441 --> 01:08:02,811
    AFTER WE HAD OUR FIGHT,

1114
01:08:02,813 --> 01:08:05,647
      AND I DROVE TO WORK,

1115
01:08:05,649 --> 01:08:10,552
        AND I LITERALLY
  COULDN'T MAKE MYSELF GO IN.

1116
01:08:15,392 --> 01:08:18,760
    I JUST COULDN'T BREATHE.

1117
01:08:22,732 --> 01:08:25,867
      AND I TURNED AROUND,
   AND I GOT BACK IN MY CAR,

1118
01:08:25,869 --> 01:08:32,674
     AND I CALLED MY BOSS,
AND I TOLD HIM THAT SHE WAS SICK

1119
01:08:32,676 --> 01:08:36,411
       AND THAT I NEEDED
  THE DAY TO TAKE CARE OF HER,

1120
01:08:36,413 --> 01:08:38,146
  BECAUSE THAT SEEMED LIKE...

1121
01:08:41,184 --> 01:08:46,421
       - THAT'S OUR BABY.
       - I KNOW. I KNOW.

1122
01:08:46,423 --> 01:08:50,892
    I HAD A REALLY GOOD DAY,

1123
01:08:50,894 --> 01:08:53,761
     AND THEN I CAME HOME,

1124
01:08:53,763 --> 01:08:58,500
 AND, LIKE, I HAD TIME TO COOK,
  AND THEN WE HAD A FUN TIME,

1125
01:08:58,502 --> 01:09:03,671
  AND FOR A SECOND, LIKE, FOR
A SPLIT FUCKING SECOND THAT DAY,

1126
01:09:03,673 --> 01:09:09,644
          I FELT KIND
     OF LIKE MYSELF AGAIN,

1127
01:09:09,646 --> 01:09:11,246
      AND I LOOKED AT YOU,

1128
01:09:11,248 --> 01:09:16,451
     AND YOU LOOKED KIND OF
        LIKE YOU AGAIN,

1129
01:09:16,453 --> 01:09:21,156
 AND I FELT LIKE, "OKAY, OKAY,
      MAYBE I CAN DO THIS.

1130
01:09:21,158 --> 01:09:25,894
       MAYBE ALL I NEEDED
     WAS JUST THAT BREAK."

1131
01:09:25,896 --> 01:09:30,198
  AND I WOKE UP THE NEXT DAY,
       AND I WENT, AND...

1132
01:09:34,771 --> 01:09:37,639
        AND I COULDN'T--

1133
01:09:37,641 --> 01:09:40,642
    I JUST COULDN'T GO BACK.

1134
01:09:40,644 --> 01:09:43,344
        I JUST COULDN'T.
       IT WASN'T ENOUGH.

1135
01:09:43,346 --> 01:09:46,381
           AND SO...

1136
01:09:46,383 --> 01:09:47,382
           - LONNIE.

1137
01:09:47,384 --> 01:09:48,716
            - SO...

1138
01:09:48,718 --> 01:09:51,686
    I CALLED MY BOSS, AND...

1139
01:10:01,731 --> 01:10:03,631
        AND I PANICKED.

1140
01:10:03,633 --> 01:10:06,801
           IT, LIKE,
    HAPPENED IN A BLACKOUT.

1141
01:10:06,803 --> 01:10:10,939
          I PANICKED,
     AND I SAID THAT SHE--

1142
01:10:10,941 --> 01:10:12,740
      THAT XANA HAD DIED.

1143
01:10:19,583 --> 01:10:23,785
    AND I WANTED TO TAKE IT
   ALL BACK, BUT I COULDN'T.

1144
01:10:23,787 --> 01:10:25,587
    I COULDN'T TAKE IT BACK.

1145
01:10:25,589 --> 01:10:28,923
      I COULDN'T TAKE BACK
         WHAT I'D DONE.

1146
01:10:28,925 --> 01:10:32,527
           - LONNIE.

1147
01:10:32,529 --> 01:10:34,762
        - AND I'M NOT--

1148
01:10:34,764 --> 01:10:37,699
  I'M NOT PUTTING THIS ON YOU
            AT ALL,

1149
01:10:37,701 --> 01:10:40,335
            AT ALL.

1150
01:10:40,337 --> 01:10:43,705
 BECAUSE I'M THE ASSHOLE HERE.

1151
01:10:47,410 --> 01:10:53,448
    BUT YOU'VE MADE CHOICES
    THAT I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

1152
01:10:55,785 --> 01:11:02,790
   AND I FEEL LIKE I'M STUCK.

1153
01:11:02,792 --> 01:11:07,362
  I'M STUCK IN SOME FUCKING...

1154
01:11:07,364 --> 01:11:11,332
         COLLEGE DREAM

1155
01:11:11,334 --> 01:11:15,937
   BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HAD TIME
 TO FIGURE OUT WHAT I WANT OR--

1156
01:11:15,939 --> 01:11:20,575
    I JUST HAVEN'T HAD TIME,
     AND I'M NOT BITCHING.

1157
01:11:20,577 --> 01:11:22,910
   IT'S WHAT A MAN SHOULD DO.

1158
01:11:22,912 --> 01:11:26,414
   IT'S WHAT A MAN SHOULD BE,
    IS BE ABLE TO TAKE CARE

1159
01:11:26,416 --> 01:11:28,583
   OF HIS WIFE AND HIS CHILD,

1160
01:11:28,585 --> 01:11:31,753
  AND THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO BE
    ABLE TO DO FOR YOU GUYS.

1161
01:11:31,755 --> 01:11:33,855
       I WANT TO BE ABLE
       TO DO THAT SO BAD,

1162
01:11:33,857 --> 01:11:36,958
    BUT, LIKE, I DON'T KNOW
   WHAT I CARE ABOUT ANYMORE.

1163
01:11:39,829 --> 01:11:42,830
        MY MUSIC SUCKS.

1164
01:11:44,934 --> 01:11:48,736
            - YEAH.
       YOUR MUSIC SUCKS.

1165
01:11:48,738 --> 01:11:51,072
            - OUCH.

1166
01:11:51,074 --> 01:11:53,675
        - YOU KNOW WHAT?

1167
01:11:58,481 --> 01:12:00,848
         WHAT I'M DOING
     SUCKS PRETTY BAD TOO.

1168
01:12:04,688 --> 01:12:08,523
    I'M NOT PROUD OF MYSELF.

1169
01:12:08,525 --> 01:12:10,725
I'M NOT PROUD OF MYSELF ANYMORE.

1170
01:12:14,998 --> 01:12:18,733
      I'M NOT PROUD OF ME,
   AND I'M NOT PROUD OF YOU.

1171
01:12:25,642 --> 01:12:26,874
            - YEAH.

1172
01:12:30,947 --> 01:12:33,514
  - I WANT TO BE PROUD OF US.

1173
01:12:33,516 --> 01:12:38,953
        - WE'RE ALLOWED
    TO CHANGE THINGS, RIGHT?

1174
01:12:41,491 --> 01:12:44,525
            - UM...

1175
01:12:44,527 --> 01:12:49,364
  - WE DON'T JUST HAVE TO KEEP
OUR HEADS DOWN UNTIL WE'RE 60...

1176
01:12:52,736 --> 01:12:57,138
 BECAUSE IF WE CAN'T FIGURE OUT
A WAY TO MAKE OURSELVES HAPPY...

1177
01:13:04,114 --> 01:13:07,982
       SHE'S GONNA BE M--

   SHE'S GONNA BE MISERABLE.

1179

- YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE GOOD AT?

1180
01:13:14,691 --> 01:13:16,824
            - WHAT?

1181
01:13:16,826 --> 01:13:19,827
   - PRETTY FUCKING GOOD DAD.

1182
01:13:27,103 --> 01:13:29,804
        YOU'RE A PRETTY
       FUCKING GOOD DAD.
