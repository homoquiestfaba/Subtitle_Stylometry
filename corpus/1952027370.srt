1
00:00:12,287 --> 00:00:14,938
Hayden Technologies...

2
00:00:15,007 --> 00:00:16,862
birthplace of what
was supposed to be

3
00:00:16,927 --> 00:00:18,869
our greatest scientific
breakthrough.

4
00:00:20,096 --> 00:00:22,267
Jackie has been unresponsive

5
00:00:22,335 --> 00:00:24,724
to all treatments.

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:26,840
I mean, naturally,
I guarantee nothing, but...

7
00:00:26,912 --> 00:00:31,007
the procedure may 
be the last hope.

8
00:00:31,139 --> 00:00:33,308
Led by Dr. Josephine Hayden,

9
00:00:33,376 --> 00:00:34,805
my team created a device

10
00:00:34,879 --> 00:00:37,497
capable of instantly
reconfiguring human DNA.

11
00:00:37,568 --> 00:00:39,128
Try that now.

12
00:00:42,463 --> 00:00:45,725
By manipulating genetic code
we learned to heal wounds,

13
00:00:45,791 --> 00:00:47,831
cure disease
all in a matter of seconds.

14
00:00:47,903 --> 00:00:50,205
Our miracle device

15
00:00:50,272 --> 00:00:51,897
was known as The Transcoder.

16
00:00:51,967 --> 00:00:54,269
There is no precedent

17
00:00:54,335 --> 00:00:56,637
for this technology.

18
00:00:56,703 --> 00:00:58,808
But even miracles
have their cost.

19
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,116
Dr. Josephine Hayden
found herself a victim

20
00:01:01,184 --> 00:01:02,777
of her own tragedy,

21
00:01:02,848 --> 00:01:06,460
her DNA mutated, leaving her
a monster beyond recognition.

22
00:01:06,528 --> 00:01:10,456
I realized that The Transcoder's
calibration to the user's unique DNA

23
00:01:10,528 --> 00:01:12,633
meant unpredictable consequences

24
00:01:12,704 --> 00:01:15,125
when operated by anyone
but its creator.

25
00:01:17,023 --> 00:01:19,958
I also realized its
potential use as a weapon.

26
00:01:35,488 --> 00:01:37,692
As one of the only
surviving scientists

27
00:01:37,760 --> 00:01:40,215
of the Hayden Technologies disaster,

28
00:01:40,288 --> 00:01:43,190
I felt it my duty
to stay in Olympia,

29
00:01:43,264 --> 00:01:47,158
perhaps restore the reputation
and honorable uses

30
00:01:47,231 --> 00:01:49,173
of genetic manipulation.

31
00:01:49,247 --> 00:01:50,807
But time is running out.

32
00:01:50,879 --> 00:01:53,814
The accident not only destroyed
Hayden Industries,

33
00:01:53,887 --> 00:01:56,473
but also the atmosphere
of Olympia,

34
00:01:56,543 --> 00:01:58,932
forcing the citizens to flee
to the unfinished walls

35
00:01:59,007 --> 00:02:00,698
surrounding our city.

36
00:02:00,767 --> 00:02:02,294
To gain admission to the walls,

37
00:02:02,368 --> 00:02:04,059
you had to pass a genetics test...

38
00:02:04,128 --> 00:02:05,688
Welcome to the Liquid Room.

39
00:02:05,760 --> 00:02:07,735
...a selection process that soon led

40
00:02:07,807 --> 00:02:10,655
desperate people
to commit desperate acts.

41
00:02:20,256 --> 00:02:22,078
Hey, what the hell
are you doing, man?

42
00:02:22,143 --> 00:02:23,834
- I apologize.
- Hey, what's the idea?

43
00:02:23,903 --> 00:02:26,042
You... that's enough!

44
00:02:26,112 --> 00:02:28,632
Those denied entry started
making cheaper clones

45
00:02:28,703 --> 00:02:30,296
of the original Transcoder

46
00:02:30,367 --> 00:02:32,156
and used them to steal the DNA

47
00:02:32,224 --> 00:02:34,645
that would qualify them
for admission...

48
00:02:35,839 --> 00:02:38,523
a crime known as DNA hacking.

49
00:02:56,447 --> 00:02:58,836
When the government
learned of this practice,

50
00:02:58,912 --> 00:03:01,497
they hired private assassins
to take out the hackers.

51
00:04:37,823 --> 00:04:40,212
Michelle, haven't I always

52
00:04:40,287 --> 00:04:42,905
taken care of you
and your brother well?

53
00:04:42,975 --> 00:04:45,277
You know, word on the street

54
00:04:45,343 --> 00:04:46,969
is that he could use the money.

55
00:04:49,599 --> 00:04:52,447
My brother, my problem.

56
00:05:20,255 --> 00:05:22,230
# Hey, you #

57
00:05:22,304 --> 00:05:24,573
# What the fuck
is wrong with you? #

58
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:26,068
# Hey, you #

59
00:05:26,144 --> 00:05:28,511
# What the fuck
is wrong with you? #

60
00:05:28,575 --> 00:05:29,916
# Hey, you #

61
00:05:29,984 --> 00:05:32,318
# What the fuck
is wrong with you? #

62
00:05:32,383 --> 00:05:33,790
# Hey, you #

63
00:05:33,855 --> 00:05:36,157
# What the fuck
is wrong with you? #

64
00:05:36,223 --> 00:05:37,630
# Hey, you #

65
00:05:37,695 --> 00:05:39,583
# What the fuck
is wrong with you? #

66
00:05:39,647 --> 00:05:41,338
I'll get you this time.

67
00:05:41,407 --> 00:05:43,708
Come on, Jack, you've lost enough
of your sister's money.

68
00:05:43,776 --> 00:05:44,986
Hey, man, shut up, all right?

69
00:05:45,055 --> 00:05:47,902
You're breaking my chi.

70
00:05:47,968 --> 00:05:49,528
Come on, Jack, you been
gambling all night

71
00:05:49,599 --> 00:05:51,355
and you're drunk to the bone.

72
00:05:51,423 --> 00:05:53,146
Blow, please. Thank you.

73
00:05:54,879 --> 00:05:56,537
- Shit.
- Come on.

74
00:05:56,608 --> 00:05:58,495
Let's go. It's already morning.

75
00:05:58,559 --> 00:06:00,250
One more, one more.

76
00:06:01,471 --> 00:06:03,293
Let's see what we got...

77
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:04,636
You lost it all?

78
00:06:04,703 --> 00:06:06,612
Crap. All right,
all right, all right.

79
00:06:06,687 --> 00:06:09,273
- It's not a big deal.
- Yeah, it's a big deal!

80
00:06:09,344 --> 00:06:11,067
I've got an idea.
All right, let's go.

81
00:06:11,135 --> 00:06:13,502
- What?
- Sir, bite me.

82
00:06:16,351 --> 00:06:17,780
No no no, don't you dare.

83
00:06:17,855 --> 00:06:19,197
- No!
- What do I always say?

84
00:06:19,263 --> 00:06:20,921
- We'll win it back.
- But we never do.

85
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,461
Hey, Randall, I need...

86
00:06:26,527 --> 00:06:28,315
we need 60... 60 grand.

87
00:06:30,879 --> 00:06:33,464
Who do you think I am,
your personal bank or something?

88
00:06:33,535 --> 00:06:35,128
Hey, come on, Randall,

89
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:37,141
you know I'm gonna
pay it back, all right?

90
00:06:38,335 --> 00:06:40,223
You still owe me
20 grand from the last time.

91
00:06:40,287 --> 00:06:41,880
Hey hey hey,
that was the juice.

92
00:06:41,951 --> 00:06:44,122
I paid you for the 80.
It was double or nothing,

93
00:06:44,191 --> 00:06:46,712
40 grand plus interest,
you got the double.

94
00:07:02,527 --> 00:07:04,698
You've got three days.

95
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:07,582
Any later, and I swear to God,

96
00:07:07,647 --> 00:07:09,371
you'll be my bitch

97
00:07:09,439 --> 00:07:11,610
licking the shit out of my ass

98
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:13,883
until you choke on it
before you die.

99
00:07:13,951 --> 00:07:16,537
Not the most
sanitary thing, but...

100
00:07:17,631 --> 00:07:20,086
I'm not kidding, Jackie.

101
00:07:20,159 --> 00:07:22,134
I'm tired of your
fucking me around.

102
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:24,541
You understand?

103
00:07:30,559 --> 00:07:32,020
You know, what?

104
00:07:33,055 --> 00:07:34,811
Consider this...

105
00:07:39,167 --> 00:07:40,825
advance payment, all right?

106
00:07:43,871 --> 00:07:45,846
What a fucking chump.
Let's go go go go.

107
00:07:52,031 --> 00:07:54,170
...leave Olympia are
reminded to have

108
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:55,963
your genetic
and entrance papers at hand

109
00:07:56,031 --> 00:07:57,787
for faster checkout...

110
00:10:08,159 --> 00:10:11,704
About time you got back.
Tell me you found Christian.

111
00:10:13,183 --> 00:10:15,801
Patience, my love.
We will find him.

112
00:10:15,871 --> 00:10:18,172
You've been saying
the same thing every day.

113
00:10:18,239 --> 00:10:20,247
I'm tired of hearing
you sing that old song.

114
00:10:20,319 --> 00:10:23,548
We will have The Transcoder
in our hands when we find him.

115
00:10:23,615 --> 00:10:25,306
Do not fear.

116
00:10:25,375 --> 00:10:27,000
I will not harm him

117
00:10:27,071 --> 00:10:29,144
before I see you healed, my sister.

118
00:10:29,215 --> 00:10:32,531
You'd better be right
about him having it.

119
00:10:32,607 --> 00:10:34,549
You're my only hope.

120
00:10:34,623 --> 00:10:37,044
Please don't let me die here.

121
00:10:40,031 --> 00:10:41,787
I will not rest...

122
00:10:45,919 --> 00:10:47,959
until I get
The Transcoder for you.

123
00:10:51,167 --> 00:10:55,029
Last night, a local safe area
turned out to be not so safe.

124
00:10:55,103 --> 00:10:57,492
A pharmaceutical executive
was fatally attacked

125
00:10:57,567 --> 00:10:59,323
by a DNA hacker

126
00:10:59,391 --> 00:11:02,260
while dining at a local hip joint,
The Liquid Room.

127
00:11:02,335 --> 00:11:04,408
The DNA hacker Kenzie Saito,

128
00:11:04,479 --> 00:11:06,813
considered a hero among his peers,

129
00:11:06,879 --> 00:11:08,854
was killed by a sniper...

130
00:11:12,031 --> 00:11:13,918
Police have arrested a suspect.

131
00:11:13,983 --> 00:11:15,771
He is now in custody.

132
00:11:30,846 --> 00:11:33,181
Jackie!

133
00:11:34,815 --> 00:11:36,244
The boss gave you three days.

134
00:11:36,319 --> 00:11:38,359
You better have the fucking money.

135
00:11:40,831 --> 00:11:43,930
- Ow!
- Your fucking goggles.

136
00:11:46,751 --> 00:11:48,824
You're a slave, man!

137
00:11:48,895 --> 00:11:50,585
A slave with a bad mustache!

138
00:11:50,654 --> 00:11:51,767
With interest?!

139
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,781
How are we gonna get
out of this one, Jackie?

140
00:11:53,855 --> 00:11:55,829
I'll think of something,
all right? I always do.

141
00:11:55,903 --> 00:11:57,332
Oh, yeah?
Like the last time

142
00:11:57,407 --> 00:11:59,578
when you almost got us
fucking killed?

143
00:11:59,646 --> 00:12:02,330
Are you dead yet, huh?

144
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:03,893
Then stop whining.

145
00:12:03,967 --> 00:12:07,283
All right, just relax and smell
the coffee or something.

146
00:12:07,359 --> 00:12:10,326
Oh, the coffee that you're gonna need
tomorrow for your hangover?

147
00:12:10,399 --> 00:12:12,286
I'm not drunk.

148
00:12:12,351 --> 00:12:14,620
What's that?

149
00:12:27,646 --> 00:12:29,239
Whoa! Shit!

150
00:12:29,310 --> 00:12:30,717
Damn it, Mich!

151
00:12:30,783 --> 00:12:33,401
- What the...
- Where's the money?

152
00:12:33,471 --> 00:12:35,740
What are you talking about?

153
00:12:35,807 --> 00:12:36,854
Ah!

154
00:12:36,927 --> 00:12:38,421
Our savings, it's gone!

155
00:12:38,495 --> 00:12:40,055
You've been
drinking again, huh?

156
00:12:40,126 --> 00:12:41,752
Which means
you've been gambling.

157
00:12:41,823 --> 00:12:44,725
- God, Jackie!
- I've lost a couple times, all right?

158
00:12:44,799 --> 00:12:46,457
It's no big deal.
So what?

159
00:12:48,543 --> 00:12:50,365
You're gambling
away our savings.

160
00:12:50,430 --> 00:12:52,372
I'm working so hard
to get us out of here.

161
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:54,072
All right, sis, you know,

162
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,696
that's the difference
between you and me.

163
00:12:56,767 --> 00:13:00,411
All right? I accept now
and the moment, while you...

164
00:13:00,479 --> 00:13:02,901
you live in this fantasy future.

165
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:04,862
Okay? Take a look around.

166
00:13:04,926 --> 00:13:08,243
This is where we belong. And all of that
Chrysanth or whatever, beach talk...

167
00:13:08,318 --> 00:13:10,173
nothing but stops there
by the way, okay?

168
00:13:10,238 --> 00:13:11,613
- Listen.
- Who would want...

169
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:15,508
Jackie, look at me.
We had a deal.

170
00:13:17,183 --> 00:13:18,677
I'm not a kid anymore, all right?

171
00:13:18,751 --> 00:13:20,987
I'm just trying to...
help out.

172
00:13:21,054 --> 00:13:22,843
Okay?

173
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:28,923
Listen, playing our
money on craps table

174
00:13:28,991 --> 00:13:30,485
doesn't qualify as helping.

175
00:13:30,559 --> 00:13:32,020
You're helping out, right?

176
00:13:32,095 --> 00:13:33,950
More like... what is it again?

177
00:13:34,015 --> 00:13:37,528
Oh yeah, killing people.

178
00:13:37,599 --> 00:13:39,060
All right?

179
00:13:39,134 --> 00:13:42,004
I'm sure Mom and Dad
are real proud of you

180
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:43,704
from right up there.

181
00:13:43,775 --> 00:13:46,044
All right? At least I'm
doing something that they did.

182
00:13:51,551 --> 00:13:53,623
Gambling was what got
them killed, Jackie.

183
00:13:55,262 --> 00:13:57,946
Listen to me. Don't think
that this is easy for me.

184
00:13:58,015 --> 00:14:01,081
I lose a bit of myself every day
killing and being here.

185
00:14:02,367 --> 00:14:03,774
Believe in me, please.

186
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:05,595
Why, huh?

187
00:14:07,007 --> 00:14:09,243
You never believed in me.

188
00:14:23,806 --> 00:14:27,003
We're screwed, man. Randall's gonna
freak out if we don't have anything

189
00:14:27,071 --> 00:14:29,886
- for him tomorrow.
- I have got an idea.

190
00:14:29,951 --> 00:14:33,115
- We're gonna die again, aren't we?
- Hey, all right,

191
00:14:33,183 --> 00:14:35,604
don't piss around on me,
I'm serious.

192
00:14:35,678 --> 00:14:38,678
My neighbor leaves every Tuesday...
he doesn't come back for days.

193
00:14:38,751 --> 00:14:41,053
No. Man, I told you,
I'm not doing that anymore.

194
00:14:41,119 --> 00:14:42,941
If I break probation,
that's it for me.

195
00:14:43,006 --> 00:14:45,046
Come on.
Pretend you're Robin Hood.

196
00:14:45,119 --> 00:14:46,974
All right, he's the rich,
we're the poor.

197
00:14:47,039 --> 00:14:48,566
Yeah, but I'm on probation.

198
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,744
Come on, man.
Where's your sense of adventure?

199
00:14:50,815 --> 00:14:53,084
You want adventure? You should
go to lockdown for three days.

200
00:14:53,151 --> 00:14:55,518
- It's very adventurous.
- I'm going in with or without you.

201
00:14:55,582 --> 00:14:56,989
I'm trying to save
both our asses.

202
00:14:57,054 --> 00:14:58,778
No, there has
to be a better option.

203
00:14:58,847 --> 00:15:01,716
- Yeah, like mine.
- I thought I said a better option.

204
00:15:03,614 --> 00:15:05,502
Look, if we can't find
any money, we'll just

205
00:15:05,567 --> 00:15:07,803
take something
that looks valuable.

206
00:15:09,567 --> 00:15:12,883
- Oh, this is all junk.
- Take something. I can sell anything.

207
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,333
Oh, great.

208
00:15:14,399 --> 00:15:17,246
Hey! I'm cutting you a deal.

209
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,285
What the hell is this?

210
00:15:19,359 --> 00:15:21,780
Man, that thing is
the latest thing.

211
00:15:21,854 --> 00:15:24,636
People will be all over you for
that shit. Worth at least 100 grand.

212
00:15:24,703 --> 00:15:27,801
Yeah, but this thing looks
like a bunch of junk

213
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:29,463
slapped onto a glove.

214
00:15:29,534 --> 00:15:30,876
I mean, what does it do, man?

215
00:15:30,943 --> 00:15:33,431
I mean, is it fashion or...
Ow! Oh my God!

216
00:15:33,503 --> 00:15:35,990
Ow, get it off me!

217
00:15:36,062 --> 00:15:38,004
Get it off me!
Get it off.

218
00:15:38,078 --> 00:15:39,507
Get it, get it,
get it, get it!

219
00:15:39,583 --> 00:15:42,071
Hey! Hey!
Where are you going?

220
00:15:43,838 --> 00:15:45,846
Come back here
you little crooks!

221
00:15:45,918 --> 00:15:48,155
I have... oh, man!

222
00:15:49,694 --> 00:15:52,247
You're gonna have to pay
for all this shit you broke!

223
00:15:52,319 --> 00:15:54,523
Why would I pay
for the shit you broke?!

224
00:15:54,591 --> 00:15:56,795
Dear God. What the hell
is that thing anyway?

225
00:15:56,863 --> 00:15:59,613
- Some Chinese finger trap for idiots...
- Whatever it is,

226
00:15:59,679 --> 00:16:01,784
we're not getting
jack shit for it, that's for sure.

227
00:16:01,855 --> 00:16:05,335
- I've still got a couple hours.
- Jackie, just call Michelle already.

228
00:16:05,406 --> 00:16:07,097
You know what?
I know another shop.

229
00:16:07,167 --> 00:16:08,628
Owner's usually
drunk by 11:00.

230
00:16:08,702 --> 00:16:11,320
Oh, come on, not another one.

231
00:16:11,391 --> 00:16:14,009
My probation officer's
gonna fuckin' kill me...

232
00:16:14,079 --> 00:16:16,828
- Shit!
- What?

233
00:16:16,894 --> 00:16:19,742
Oh! Probably just a Chinese
finger trap for idiots!

234
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,423
I'm not an idiot. I just wanted to make
sure this thing was still working.

235
00:16:22,494 --> 00:16:24,250
You're an idiot.

236
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:27,318
Why would you do that
after you saw that guy get...

237
00:16:27,390 --> 00:16:29,529
- You put it on.
- I'm not putting that on!

238
00:16:29,599 --> 00:16:31,901
Why would I put that on?

239
00:17:59,262 --> 00:18:02,426
Failure to comply can
result in section C arrest

240
00:18:02,494 --> 00:18:04,829
and felony charges
which will immediately

241
00:18:04,895 --> 00:18:07,513
disqualify you for...

242
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:43,705
# That shit
will fuck you over... #

243
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:05,495
# That shit
will fuck you over. #

244
00:19:53,567 --> 00:19:56,185
Aw, shit.

245
00:19:56,255 --> 00:19:58,164
Holy shit!

246
00:19:58,238 --> 00:20:00,213
What?

247
00:20:03,231 --> 00:20:05,435
Did you do that?

248
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,990
Forget it, forget it.

249
00:20:08,062 --> 00:20:09,557
Like I have to ask.

250
00:20:15,295 --> 00:20:17,051
Who is he?

251
00:20:17,119 --> 00:20:19,191
They came for you... three of them.

252
00:20:23,710 --> 00:20:26,328
Yeah, look, Mich, I can explain.

253
00:20:26,398 --> 00:20:28,853
You don't have to explain.

254
00:20:28,926 --> 00:20:31,960
I just want you to know this is
what happens when you gamble.

255
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,060
And you will get us killed.

256
00:20:35,134 --> 00:20:38,517
- See, that's the point. I didn't even...
- Jackie, listen.

257
00:20:38,591 --> 00:20:40,794
This is not a joke.

258
00:20:40,863 --> 00:20:42,651
And this is the last time.

259
00:20:44,670 --> 00:20:47,605
Promise me you will
never gamble again.

260
00:20:47,678 --> 00:20:49,980
You must promise.

261
00:20:53,534 --> 00:20:55,290
And I'll forget about it.

262
00:20:59,326 --> 00:21:01,115
Cool.

263
00:21:05,182 --> 00:21:07,037
Good boy. Let's go.

264
00:21:07,102 --> 00:21:09,436
Where?

265
00:21:09,502 --> 00:21:11,357
Finish the job.

266
00:21:11,422 --> 00:21:13,527
Oh, no no no. Mich, you just
cannot go walking...

267
00:21:13,598 --> 00:21:15,027
I'm gonna fix this problem.

268
00:21:21,726 --> 00:21:24,541
We've narrowed down
our search for Christian.

269
00:21:24,606 --> 00:21:27,902
He's living somewhere
in section D5 of Olympia.

270
00:21:29,246 --> 00:21:32,093
I haven't been able to pinpoint
his exact location.

271
00:21:33,311 --> 00:21:35,253
But we're close,

272
00:21:35,326 --> 00:21:37,050
very close.

273
00:21:37,118 --> 00:21:39,223
Whatever you do, I'd be careful.

274
00:21:42,014 --> 00:21:44,883
If he senses you're on his tail,
he might do something drastic

275
00:21:44,958 --> 00:21:47,708
like destroy The Transcoder.

276
00:21:47,774 --> 00:21:49,683
I doubt that.

277
00:21:51,103 --> 00:21:53,175
If he discovers
that we're still alive,

278
00:21:53,246 --> 00:21:56,824
he may realize that we still
have the prototype chip.

279
00:21:56,894 --> 00:21:59,611
In that case,

280
00:21:59,678 --> 00:22:03,257
he may actually
be seeking us now.

281
00:22:03,327 --> 00:22:04,537
Where is it?

282
00:22:05,982 --> 00:22:09,462
Where is it? Idiot!

283
00:22:41,534 --> 00:22:43,574
The online tracker...

284
00:22:43,646 --> 00:22:45,818
something came up, what is it?

285
00:22:45,886 --> 00:22:49,268
I think our noble scientist
has just made a mistake.

286
00:22:51,231 --> 00:22:52,637
We've got him.

287
00:23:19,134 --> 00:23:20,956
This better be worth my time.

288
00:23:29,118 --> 00:23:30,973
Stay out of my house.

289
00:23:39,614 --> 00:23:43,127
Those guys came into my house
and tried to kill me.

290
00:23:43,198 --> 00:23:45,816
Well, you look

291
00:23:45,886 --> 00:23:48,253
pretty alive to me.

292
00:23:48,318 --> 00:23:51,286
It's just it wasn't you
that they were going after.

293
00:23:52,894 --> 00:23:55,577
You just happened
to get in the way.

294
00:23:55,646 --> 00:23:58,330
Now if he doesn't
come up with the money,

295
00:23:58,398 --> 00:24:01,081
then he's gonna pay
in another way.

296
00:24:05,054 --> 00:24:06,996
How much?

297
00:24:08,190 --> 00:24:10,394
So who the hell are you?

298
00:24:10,462 --> 00:24:12,284
I'm his sister.

299
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:15,416
His sister!

300
00:24:15,486 --> 00:24:17,242
Well now, I thought

301
00:24:17,310 --> 00:24:20,060
I had seen everything.

302
00:24:20,126 --> 00:24:22,547
Ow!

303
00:24:22,622 --> 00:24:24,215
How much?

304
00:24:24,286 --> 00:24:26,774
- 160 grand.
- Here's 200,000.

305
00:24:26,846 --> 00:24:28,788
This should cover it.

306
00:24:29,854 --> 00:24:31,862
All right, sister,

307
00:24:31,934 --> 00:24:33,690
that'll do just fine.

308
00:24:45,182 --> 00:24:46,775
Oh, wait a minute.

309
00:24:46,846 --> 00:24:50,457
You know, I might need
just a little more money

310
00:24:50,526 --> 00:24:54,071
to cover this dumbass's
medical bills.

311
00:24:57,598 --> 00:24:59,354
I'll be happy to take care of him.

312
00:25:51,902 --> 00:25:53,844
What's up?

313
00:26:12,510 --> 00:26:14,877
Shit.

314
00:26:17,726 --> 00:26:19,220
Jackie, help me out here.

315
00:26:19,294 --> 00:26:22,458
No, just... just leave
him in his apartment.

316
00:26:22,526 --> 00:26:23,933
I can't.

317
00:26:23,998 --> 00:26:25,821
He'll be out for at least 36 hours.

318
00:26:25,886 --> 00:26:28,122
You know this is why
you're still single, right?

319
00:26:29,405 --> 00:26:31,511
Besides, we can't
get in without his code.

320
00:26:31,582 --> 00:26:32,988
So I'll just call Mouse.

321
00:26:33,054 --> 00:26:34,777
No breaking in.

322
00:26:35,870 --> 00:26:38,107
He can crash with us.
Come on.

323
00:26:38,174 --> 00:26:40,563
This is ridiculous.

324
00:26:40,638 --> 00:26:42,394
- Hey!
- Ow!

325
00:26:43,582 --> 00:26:45,469
- Shit.
- What happened to your hand?

326
00:26:45,534 --> 00:26:46,941
- Nothing, all right?
- Nothing?

327
00:26:47,006 --> 00:26:49,559
- No, nothing.
- It could get infected.

328
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:52,597
- How did you get it?
- Some girl gave me a punk bracelet.

329
00:26:52,670 --> 00:26:54,645
I scratched it up.
It's nothing.

330
00:26:54,718 --> 00:26:56,660
Be careful. Come on.

331
00:27:00,574 --> 00:27:03,192
I can't just leave him.

332
00:27:03,262 --> 00:27:05,749
This is coming from
"Pow! Medical bills covered."

333
00:27:05,822 --> 00:27:07,797
Don't you have to be
somewhere right now?

334
00:27:09,950 --> 00:27:11,957
Nah, Mouse ain't even awake yet.

335
00:27:12,030 --> 00:27:15,346
- You're gonna work at my friend's club.
- Today?

336
00:27:15,422 --> 00:27:17,626
- Well, I had a really rough...
- Jackie.

337
00:27:18,814 --> 00:27:20,603
Dang.

338
00:27:20,670 --> 00:27:22,525
Shit.

339
00:27:29,694 --> 00:27:32,727
There's some money on the table.
Get some food on the way back, will you?

340
00:27:43,710 --> 00:27:46,165
My mattress.

341
00:28:26,206 --> 00:28:27,766
# Let your blood flow #

342
00:28:27,838 --> 00:28:29,693
# Get your body beat #

343
00:28:29,758 --> 00:28:31,613
# Let your blood flow #

344
00:28:31,678 --> 00:28:33,620
# Get your body beat #

345
00:28:33,694 --> 00:28:35,320
# Let your blood flow... #

346
00:28:37,886 --> 00:28:39,163
# Let your blood flow #

347
00:28:39,230 --> 00:28:40,953
# Get your body beat... #

348
00:28:47,390 --> 00:28:49,398
# Trick your brain
to set the score #

349
00:28:51,198 --> 00:28:54,329
# Can you take
the pain at all? #

350
00:28:54,398 --> 00:28:56,918
# I try to
understand you, girl #

351
00:28:58,398 --> 00:29:00,667
# But you've
got to earn it #

352
00:29:00,733 --> 00:29:03,100
# Fuck it up
and let it go... #

353
00:29:08,190 --> 00:29:09,684
Whoo!
Look out.

354
00:29:09,758 --> 00:29:11,645
Come on.

355
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,913
Hey hey, guys.
Welcome to Club Metroid.

356
00:29:13,982 --> 00:29:15,705
Hey, come on, man!

357
00:29:17,309 --> 00:29:18,902
You forgot your tickets.

358
00:29:36,894 --> 00:29:39,065
Come on, come on.

359
00:29:41,022 --> 00:29:44,120
- Hello.
- Listen, you know that glove we found?

360
00:29:44,189 --> 00:29:47,538
- The death one?
- I'm serious. The guy's looking for it.

361
00:29:47,614 --> 00:29:50,429
- He's all sneaking up on us and shit.
- God, your neighbor?

362
00:29:50,494 --> 00:29:52,404
What are you gonna do?

363
00:29:52,477 --> 00:29:54,965
I guess I'll have
to think of something.

364
00:29:55,038 --> 00:29:56,925
Hey, I can't talk
right now, all right?

365
00:29:56,990 --> 00:29:58,364
Okay, cool. Bye.

366
00:29:58,430 --> 00:30:00,797
Welcome to Club Metroid,
gentle... men.

367
00:30:06,398 --> 00:30:10,424
Well, Club Metro's got
a new hatcheck girl.

368
00:30:13,150 --> 00:30:14,710
Come on, man!

369
00:30:14,782 --> 00:30:17,367
- I thought we were even!
- Oh, we're far from even.

370
00:30:17,437 --> 00:30:20,187
I lose three guys because of you.

371
00:30:20,254 --> 00:30:23,451
- How will you pay me back this time?
- It wasn't me and you know it.

372
00:30:23,518 --> 00:30:25,111
But it's definitely your problem.

373
00:30:28,253 --> 00:30:30,425
What is this?

374
00:30:31,646 --> 00:30:33,653
Your sister give you this too?

375
00:30:33,726 --> 00:30:37,141
Huh? You know, two whores
in one family, that's not good.

376
00:30:39,102 --> 00:30:41,972
Now I'm gonna start
to even the score.

377
00:30:42,045 --> 00:30:45,242
You've pissed me off
too many times, Jackie.

378
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:47,219
So now I'm gonna piss on you.

379
00:30:52,349 --> 00:30:54,171
You know, it takes longer

380
00:30:54,238 --> 00:30:56,572
to get started pissing
when you get older?

381
00:30:56,638 --> 00:30:58,394
But you're never gonna know that.

382
00:31:08,317 --> 00:31:10,968
I'm serious, I lost the money.
It must have fell out of my pocket.

383
00:31:11,038 --> 00:31:12,631
You don't lose money like that!

384
00:31:12,702 --> 00:31:15,124
I was at my job and Randall,
he came into the club,

385
00:31:15,197 --> 00:31:17,718
pulled me into the bathroom
and then he stole it from me.

386
00:31:17,790 --> 00:31:19,219
All right? L-look at my hair.

387
00:31:19,294 --> 00:31:20,820
Is it still...

388
00:31:20,893 --> 00:31:22,966
it still has shit in it!

389
00:31:23,038 --> 00:31:24,947
All right?
Does that make you happy?

390
00:31:25,022 --> 00:31:26,429
I got shit in my fucking hair.

391
00:31:26,494 --> 00:31:28,436
- Coat checked my fuckin' ass!
- You promised!

392
00:31:28,510 --> 00:31:30,812
You promised you wouldn't
get into any more trouble!

393
00:31:30,878 --> 00:31:34,042
I'm literally covered in shit!

394
00:31:34,110 --> 00:31:36,499
All right, is that what Mom and Dad
would have wanted?

395
00:31:37,758 --> 00:31:41,020
Jackie, you know

396
00:31:41,086 --> 00:31:43,639
- Mother and Father loved us.
- No.

397
00:31:43,710 --> 00:31:46,263
They were the ones
who left us behind.

398
00:32:13,822 --> 00:32:15,447
It's your favorite.

399
00:32:15,517 --> 00:32:17,078
Mm.

400
00:32:17,150 --> 00:32:18,972
Come on, eat up.
You'll feel better.

401
00:32:22,685 --> 00:32:24,343
What?

402
00:32:26,333 --> 00:32:30,130
Nah, I'll probably just fuck it up
like everything else.

403
00:32:30,206 --> 00:32:33,021
God, I hate it when
you say that shit.

404
00:32:33,086 --> 00:32:35,541
Just forget it, all right?

405
00:32:36,574 --> 00:32:39,324
I think I just
need some down time.

406
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:40,916
All right, I'll catch you later.

407
00:32:47,709 --> 00:32:49,236
Oh, well.

408
00:33:28,062 --> 00:33:29,884
Who the fuck are you?

409
00:33:29,949 --> 00:33:32,371
Where's Christian?

410
00:33:32,446 --> 00:33:34,136
Who wants to know?

411
00:33:35,645 --> 00:33:37,532
The Transcoder.

412
00:33:37,598 --> 00:33:39,965
I don't have a clue what
you're talking about, okay?

413
00:33:40,030 --> 00:33:41,274
Get your hands off me!

414
00:33:41,342 --> 00:33:44,124
- Where is it?!
- Where's what?

415
00:33:44,189 --> 00:33:46,196
The device that
gave you these wounds.

416
00:33:46,269 --> 00:33:48,244
Ow! Okay, all right!
Ease up!

417
00:33:48,318 --> 00:33:50,227
Aw, shit.

418
00:33:50,301 --> 00:33:53,051
A guy... a guy named
Randall's got it.

419
00:33:55,486 --> 00:33:57,242
I need it back.

420
00:33:57,310 --> 00:33:58,935
What...

421
00:33:59,005 --> 00:34:00,761
what's in it for me?

422
00:34:00,829 --> 00:34:03,731
You get to eat, shit,
live and be merry.

423
00:34:05,758 --> 00:34:07,514
Forget it.

424
00:34:07,581 --> 00:34:08,988
What?

425
00:34:09,053 --> 00:34:10,941
My life's a shit
sandwich anyway, man.

426
00:34:11,006 --> 00:34:12,599
Huh?!

427
00:34:12,670 --> 00:34:14,011
Come on!
Shoot me, kill me,

428
00:34:14,078 --> 00:34:17,427
do me a favor!

429
00:34:34,781 --> 00:34:37,302
50 grand.

430
00:34:38,909 --> 00:34:41,364
50,000... 50,000 bucks?

431
00:34:42,942 --> 00:34:45,724
The other half when you
deliver The Transcoder.

432
00:34:47,197 --> 00:34:48,724
But if you can't do it,

433
00:34:48,798 --> 00:34:51,132
better make sure your
affairs are in order.

434
00:35:07,838 --> 00:35:09,463
Yo, Mouse.

435
00:35:09,533 --> 00:35:11,126
Hey. Ooh, sorry.

436
00:35:11,197 --> 00:35:12,604
Just put it back.

437
00:35:12,669 --> 00:35:14,131
I'm sorry.

438
00:35:15,453 --> 00:35:17,908
Hey... hey,
what the hell, man?

439
00:35:17,981 --> 00:35:20,218
- Shh.
- What the fuck?

440
00:35:20,285 --> 00:35:21,747
Where the hell
did you get that?

441
00:35:21,821 --> 00:35:25,433
Oh, this? Just from some guy
looking for The Transcoder.

442
00:35:25,501 --> 00:35:28,850
- The what?
- Thing we found at my neighbor's place!

443
00:35:28,925 --> 00:35:30,354
Not that... that stabbing thing?

444
00:35:30,430 --> 00:35:31,956
Yes!

445
00:35:32,029 --> 00:35:35,161
This is only half. We get another
50 grand when we deliver.

446
00:35:35,230 --> 00:35:37,270
- Huh?
- No.

447
00:35:37,341 --> 00:35:38,770
No, Jackie. No.

448
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,634
Yes! This is the real deal, man.

449
00:35:40,701 --> 00:35:43,035
And there's a hell of a lot
more where this came from.

450
00:35:43,101 --> 00:35:44,760
And when we give it
to the guy, what,

451
00:35:44,830 --> 00:35:47,001
you think he's gonna
be cool with us walking?

452
00:35:47,069 --> 00:35:49,491
Come on, man.
You know me, all right?

453
00:35:49,565 --> 00:35:51,954
I need you there.
I can't do this alone.

454
00:35:55,998 --> 00:35:57,591
All right?

455
00:36:00,894 --> 00:36:02,454
I thought you had my back?

456
00:36:02,525 --> 00:36:04,946
I do, man, but...

457
00:36:05,021 --> 00:36:06,876
it's suicide.

458
00:36:06,941 --> 00:36:08,534
Suicide?

459
00:36:08,605 --> 00:36:10,132
Huh. All right.

460
00:36:10,205 --> 00:36:12,409
You did that on your own
a long time ago.

461
00:36:12,478 --> 00:36:15,412
W-what if your probation officer
finds out about your gambling

462
00:36:15,485 --> 00:36:17,340
and breaking
into Christian's place...

463
00:36:17,405 --> 00:36:18,867
That was all
fucking you, Jackie.

464
00:36:18,942 --> 00:36:21,397
I got this gig now
and I'm digging it.

465
00:36:21,470 --> 00:36:23,379
Okay?

466
00:36:23,453 --> 00:36:25,558
You freak.

467
00:36:25,629 --> 00:36:28,945
What, are you gonna spend the rest
of your life working in that shithole?

468
00:36:31,678 --> 00:36:34,166
What a fucking loser.

469
00:36:34,237 --> 00:36:36,212
You're a fucking loser!

470
00:36:44,158 --> 00:36:46,198
And that is all I have.

471
00:38:06,621 --> 00:38:10,134
What, did you wake up this morning
and decide it was a good day to die?

472
00:38:10,205 --> 00:38:12,310
All it takes is one bullet
to kill a man.

473
00:38:17,181 --> 00:38:19,799
What are you, nuts?!

474
00:38:19,869 --> 00:38:23,131
Did some of that shit
from last night seep into your brain

475
00:38:23,197 --> 00:38:25,084
and make you stupider?!

476
00:38:26,109 --> 00:38:28,019
Where's The Trans...

477
00:38:28,093 --> 00:38:29,784
the thing you took from me?

478
00:38:30,845 --> 00:38:33,845
Well, we've got a problem.

479
00:38:33,917 --> 00:38:35,804
I gave it away.

480
00:38:35,870 --> 00:38:38,717
Now why don't you
be a good little boy

481
00:38:38,781 --> 00:38:40,570
and put down the gun

482
00:38:40,637 --> 00:38:42,328
and let's... dance or something?

483
00:38:42,397 --> 00:38:44,982
I guess it is a good day to die!

484
00:38:45,053 --> 00:38:46,809
Whoa!

485
00:38:49,757 --> 00:38:51,797
All right!
All right, I'll get it!

486
00:38:51,869 --> 00:38:53,276
No!

487
00:38:53,341 --> 00:38:55,513
Send someone else to get it.
You stay on your knees!

488
00:39:11,998 --> 00:39:14,169
All right. Are we cool now?

489
00:39:15,357 --> 00:39:17,878
Is there anything else
that you want?

490
00:39:17,949 --> 00:39:20,088
- Lick my shoes.
- What?!

491
00:39:20,157 --> 00:39:21,783
Lick my shoes!

492
00:39:21,853 --> 00:39:25,017
No no no.

493
00:39:25,085 --> 00:39:27,125
The bottom.

494
00:39:29,085 --> 00:39:31,289
Stay back.

495
00:39:36,221 --> 00:39:38,643
No! Don't shoot!

496
00:39:38,717 --> 00:39:42,034
I want him alive!

497
00:40:56,573 --> 00:40:58,264
You got it?

498
00:41:01,533 --> 00:41:03,388
Hey, kid?

499
00:41:03,453 --> 00:41:05,428
I'm talking to you.

500
00:41:16,477 --> 00:41:18,070
Tracking device.

501
00:41:29,278 --> 00:41:30,936
So how did it feel?

502
00:41:41,661 --> 00:41:43,635
Don't spend it all in one place.

503
00:41:55,837 --> 00:41:57,779
You know what, kid?

504
00:42:02,141 --> 00:42:03,734
You did okay.

505
00:42:03,805 --> 00:42:06,139
I could use someone like you.

506
00:43:51,101 --> 00:43:53,109
The Transcoder is ours.

507
00:43:53,180 --> 00:43:54,773
I knew you'd find it.

508
00:43:54,844 --> 00:43:58,325
You were right about Christian
having it the whole time.

509
00:43:58,397 --> 00:44:00,087
Hurry. Hook it up.

510
00:44:20,797 --> 00:44:22,936
The calibration shift.

511
00:44:52,765 --> 00:44:54,390
Hey.

512
00:45:00,124 --> 00:45:01,913
Where the hell
is The Transcoder?

513
00:45:04,861 --> 00:45:08,439
- Calm down, we can talk.
- Give me the damn Transcoder!

514
00:45:08,509 --> 00:45:12,022
Put the gun down. Listen, I don't have
a clue what you're talking about.

515
00:45:12,093 --> 00:45:14,035
Don't play stupid with me.
I know you have it.

516
00:45:14,109 --> 00:45:16,084
She doesn't have it!

517
00:45:16,157 --> 00:45:18,458
- Jackie, what...
- His place is trashed, all right!

518
00:45:18,525 --> 00:45:20,051
The door was open
when I got home.

519
00:45:20,125 --> 00:45:22,329
So whoever broke in probably
has your stupid thingy!

520
00:45:24,445 --> 00:45:27,576
Then why did my homing device
lead me straight to the two of you?

521
00:45:29,917 --> 00:45:31,706
Under the sink, grab the ropes.

522
00:45:42,045 --> 00:45:44,085
This is the second time in a week.

523
00:45:44,157 --> 00:45:45,848
Are you going to tell me
what's going on?

524
00:45:45,917 --> 00:45:47,640
What?

525
00:45:47,709 --> 00:45:51,189
Just because you don't have it
doesn't mean you didn't have it.

526
00:45:51,260 --> 00:45:52,635
What are you not telling me?

527
00:45:52,701 --> 00:45:54,075
Nothing!

528
00:45:54,140 --> 00:45:56,955
Jackie, this is not a good
time to play games with me.

529
00:45:58,301 --> 00:46:00,243
Would it kill you just
to believe me once?

530
00:46:04,348 --> 00:46:05,875
You know what?

531
00:46:05,949 --> 00:46:07,378
I gotta... I gotta go.

532
00:46:07,453 --> 00:46:09,525
Mouse set me up
with an interview.

533
00:46:09,597 --> 00:46:11,485
Everything looks good here.

534
00:46:47,165 --> 00:46:49,074
Hey!

535
00:46:50,589 --> 00:46:52,923
Are you calm enough
to tell me what's this Trans...

536
00:46:52,989 --> 00:46:54,363
Transcoder.

537
00:46:54,429 --> 00:46:56,251
Transcoder is?

538
00:46:59,037 --> 00:47:01,884
If you really don't know,
then you're better off.

539
00:47:02,908 --> 00:47:05,047
Safer.

540
00:47:06,652 --> 00:47:10,035
If I were you, I wouldn't be
worrying about my safety.

541
00:47:10,109 --> 00:47:11,832
Huh.

542
00:47:11,900 --> 00:47:13,689
Well?

543
00:47:18,845 --> 00:47:20,852
The Transcoder...

544
00:47:20,925 --> 00:47:22,583
it's a unidirectional

545
00:47:22,653 --> 00:47:24,027
biological

546
00:47:24,093 --> 00:47:26,035
encoder.

547
00:47:26,108 --> 00:47:28,018
A what?

548
00:47:29,245 --> 00:47:30,870
It reconfigures a person's DNA

549
00:47:30,941 --> 00:47:34,040
in various sequences
without the need for a tissue sample.

550
00:47:43,036 --> 00:47:45,884
- You have illegal contraband.
- I had.

551
00:47:47,101 --> 00:47:50,450
This device could end
disease as we know it.

552
00:47:50,525 --> 00:47:52,859
It would wipe out
the pharmaceutical industry.

553
00:47:52,924 --> 00:47:56,273
You take this device,
upload the information...

554
00:47:56,349 --> 00:47:59,000
- You're a DNA hacker.
- Only takes one rearrangement to kill.

555
00:47:59,069 --> 00:48:00,476
That's a DNA hacker.

556
00:48:01,885 --> 00:48:04,754
But it also takes
one rearrangement to heal.

557
00:48:04,829 --> 00:48:07,578
And that's a DNA scientist.

558
00:48:11,965 --> 00:48:14,201
And that's what I am.

559
00:48:14,269 --> 00:48:17,051
This Transcoder is different.

560
00:48:17,117 --> 00:48:20,826
I built it to introduce
RNA nanoparticles into the body.

561
00:48:20,893 --> 00:48:24,537
It's like a... a subtle addition
of new DNA instructions.

562
00:48:24,604 --> 00:48:26,677
What's so new and so
special about this one?

563
00:48:26,749 --> 00:48:28,603
It's special in that
it doesn't need to sample

564
00:48:28,669 --> 00:48:30,523
the patient's DNA
to write effective code.

565
00:48:32,188 --> 00:48:34,610
It's also the last one.

566
00:48:36,284 --> 00:48:38,423
The microchip containing
the blueprints

567
00:48:38,493 --> 00:48:40,402
was destroyed in the fire.

568
00:48:49,661 --> 00:48:51,450
You have to believe me.

569
00:48:54,717 --> 00:48:56,059
Ow.

570
00:48:57,308 --> 00:48:58,835
What are these?

571
00:49:00,221 --> 00:49:02,774
It's The Transcoder.

572
00:49:02,845 --> 00:49:06,194
It punctures into the arm
to retrieve a sample DNA code.

573
00:49:06,269 --> 00:49:09,302
It then sends that
code to another host.

574
00:49:09,372 --> 00:49:12,406
Since no two
DNA codes can co-exist,

575
00:49:12,477 --> 00:49:15,127
the results...

576
00:49:15,196 --> 00:49:16,985
could be catastrophic.

577
00:49:35,196 --> 00:49:37,782
You should learn to do
your homework, Solemn.

578
00:49:37,853 --> 00:49:39,063
Jackie...

579
00:49:39,132 --> 00:49:41,466
is the brother of one
of my trained assassins...

580
00:49:41,533 --> 00:49:42,907
Michelle.

581
00:49:42,972 --> 00:49:45,361
Bring him back!
Bring me Christian.

582
00:49:45,437 --> 00:49:47,673
The assassin lives
next door to Christian.

583
00:49:47,740 --> 00:49:49,879
Good.

584
00:49:49,948 --> 00:49:51,836
Make things even easier.

585
00:49:51,901 --> 00:49:55,250
Don't assume things
are so easy, Abraham.

586
00:49:55,325 --> 00:49:57,594
I'll give Michelle one last mission.

587
00:49:57,661 --> 00:50:01,436
Michelle, details of your last
assignment are all in the folder.

588
00:50:01,501 --> 00:50:03,705
Bring back this hacker

589
00:50:03,773 --> 00:50:06,293
and the tickets will be yours.

590
00:50:06,364 --> 00:50:09,015
When we have what we want,
we'll leave at once

591
00:50:09,085 --> 00:50:12,729
before she realizes that those tickets
are already spoken for.

592
00:50:12,796 --> 00:50:14,771
I can bring Christian back myself!

593
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:17,430
- We don't need to use...
- You'll stay here

594
00:50:17,500 --> 00:50:19,224
and look after our sister.

595
00:50:19,293 --> 00:50:22,424
Don't worry.
Michelle has never failed me.

596
00:50:22,492 --> 00:50:26,038
When she gets her mission,
we get Christian.

597
00:50:34,397 --> 00:50:36,055
Consider it done.

598
00:51:14,684 --> 00:51:17,651
Is this the way you usually
introduce yourself to strangers?

599
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,981
Worse.

600
00:51:21,052 --> 00:51:22,994
I can believe it.

601
00:51:26,268 --> 00:51:29,138
- The answer's no.
- To what?

602
00:51:30,492 --> 00:51:32,150
I don't have The Transcoder.

603
00:51:33,661 --> 00:51:35,603
I wasn't going to ask about it.

604
00:51:41,212 --> 00:51:43,154
Chrysanthemum tea, my favorite.

605
00:51:48,956 --> 00:51:50,549
You could've killed me.

606
00:51:51,740 --> 00:51:53,563
Yeah, it could be worse.

607
00:51:53,629 --> 00:51:55,417
You think I'm one of them, don't you?

608
00:51:55,485 --> 00:51:57,339
- One of what?
- A DNA hacker.

609
00:52:02,140 --> 00:52:03,896
It's okay.

610
00:52:04,924 --> 00:52:06,615
Most people do.

611
00:52:09,372 --> 00:52:11,794
We live in a world where we're judged
in everything we do.

612
00:52:11,869 --> 00:52:13,724
You're either this or that,

613
00:52:13,789 --> 00:52:15,349
nothing in between.

614
00:52:17,948 --> 00:52:21,047
I know what that feels like.

615
00:52:21,117 --> 00:52:22,972
You always carry these?

616
00:52:30,012 --> 00:52:31,954
- Protection.
- Yeah?

617
00:52:32,029 --> 00:52:34,614
Yeah. Or...

618
00:52:36,540 --> 00:52:38,962
- you're an assassin.
- What are you saying?

619
00:52:39,037 --> 00:52:43,063
It's not too hard to put two and two
together... the way you live.

620
00:52:43,133 --> 00:52:46,132
You're an introvert, recluse...

621
00:52:46,204 --> 00:52:48,027
secretive. Not to mention

622
00:52:48,093 --> 00:52:51,671
your physical prowess
and your general knowledge

623
00:52:51,740 --> 00:52:53,234
about DNA hacking.

624
00:53:00,988 --> 00:53:02,548
You're judging me now?

625
00:53:08,701 --> 00:53:12,345
You lead the exact same
kind of lifestyle as I do.

626
00:53:12,412 --> 00:53:14,387
It's ironic, isn't it?

627
00:53:14,461 --> 00:53:17,014
It's like whatever
path we choose in this life,

628
00:53:17,085 --> 00:53:20,151
this generation has been
set up to extinguish itself.

629
00:53:24,636 --> 00:53:27,319
I often feel like
I'm fighting a losing battle.

630
00:53:32,572 --> 00:53:34,361
I know exactly how that feels.

631
00:53:37,628 --> 00:53:39,897
Did you ever feel like you...

632
00:53:41,949 --> 00:53:44,436
like you just want to get away...

633
00:53:46,428 --> 00:53:48,152
from all of this?

634
00:53:56,892 --> 00:53:58,747
All the time.

635
00:54:30,044 --> 00:54:31,703
I should get back to my apartment.

636
00:54:34,012 --> 00:54:35,768
It must be a mess.

637
00:55:35,516 --> 00:55:37,687
Hello.

638
00:55:37,756 --> 00:55:39,382
Hello?

639
00:55:39,452 --> 00:55:42,005
- Get him! Hold him still.
- Hello?

640
00:55:42,076 --> 00:55:44,148
Hello?

641
00:55:50,044 --> 00:55:52,411
Beat your ass! Come here!

642
00:55:58,268 --> 00:56:00,210
Keep running like a bitch!

643
00:56:48,828 --> 00:56:50,421
Chrysanthemum tea.

644
00:56:52,124 --> 00:56:53,618
Thank you.

645
00:56:53,692 --> 00:56:55,154
You're welcome.

646
00:57:08,412 --> 00:57:10,616
I'm sorry about the time I hit you.

647
00:57:10,684 --> 00:57:12,309
Hmm, which time?

648
00:57:17,596 --> 00:57:19,898
- DNA hacker...
- Scientist, please.

649
00:57:20,924 --> 00:57:22,135
How long?

650
00:57:22,204 --> 00:57:24,026
Well, we developed
the technology

651
00:57:24,092 --> 00:57:26,580
in the human genomics lab
about 20 years ago.

652
00:57:26,652 --> 00:57:28,986
- 20 years ago?
- Yes.

653
00:57:29,052 --> 00:57:32,183
At the time, you know,
our work was deemed

654
00:57:32,252 --> 00:57:33,878
too radical.

655
00:57:33,948 --> 00:57:37,047
Somebody blew up our laboratory.

656
00:57:38,332 --> 00:57:40,470
I suppose it was for the best.

657
00:57:40,540 --> 00:57:42,329
What do you mean?

658
00:57:44,092 --> 00:57:45,521
Hayden and her brothers

659
00:57:45,597 --> 00:57:48,117
were packaging our
research as a weapon.

660
00:57:50,716 --> 00:57:53,204
It went against everything
I stood for as a scientist.

661
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:58,715
You see, Hayden wanted
that technology.

662
00:58:00,668 --> 00:58:03,156
Now that they've
found me, Michelle...

663
00:58:04,284 --> 00:58:05,691
it's over.

664
00:58:08,476 --> 00:58:11,062
They probably have it
in their hands already.

665
00:58:11,132 --> 00:58:13,914
- How can you be so sure...
- Only they know how to use it.

666
00:58:13,980 --> 00:58:16,566
The Transcoder itself is useless

667
00:58:16,636 --> 00:58:18,130
without the machine required

668
00:58:18,204 --> 00:58:19,633
to upload the information.

669
00:58:19,708 --> 00:58:22,610
That machine... the only one
of its kind... is with them.

670
00:58:30,204 --> 00:58:31,993
Excuse me.

671
00:58:59,292 --> 00:59:01,267
Randall.

672
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,489
What do you want now?

673
00:59:10,556 --> 00:59:12,760
Where's Jackie?

674
00:59:17,180 --> 00:59:19,351
Big sister

675
00:59:19,420 --> 00:59:21,657
looking for her little
shithead brother.

676
00:59:25,820 --> 00:59:27,893
Well, I don't have him,

677
00:59:27,963 --> 00:59:29,622
but if I did...

678
00:59:29,692 --> 00:59:31,699
what are you gonna do about it?

679
00:59:36,380 --> 00:59:38,202
You have five minutes to get him.

680
00:59:39,676 --> 00:59:42,065
What is it with you and your family?

681
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:44,529
You think you can
just call the shots

682
00:59:44,604 --> 00:59:46,676
any time, anywhere?

683
00:59:47,804 --> 00:59:50,073
What are you going to do?

684
00:59:51,548 --> 00:59:53,075
Who the fuck are you?!

685
00:59:54,491 --> 00:59:57,208
You came in here.
This is my place.

686
00:59:57,276 --> 01:00:00,887
- I give the orders...
- Take me to Jackie.

687
01:00:00,956 --> 01:00:03,924
Shoot her in
the fucking head and...

688
01:00:10,811 --> 01:00:12,721
Take me to my brother.

689
01:00:15,260 --> 01:00:16,885
Now.

690
01:00:19,644 --> 01:00:21,368
Jackie?

691
01:00:24,732 --> 01:00:26,390
Open the door!

692
01:00:36,956 --> 01:00:38,549
Jackie!

693
01:01:13,980 --> 01:01:15,670
Jackie.

694
01:01:32,988 --> 01:01:36,249
Michelle is taking
too long to bring Christian.

695
01:01:36,316 --> 01:01:39,163
I've almost cracked
The Transcoder's code.

696
01:01:40,828 --> 01:01:43,316
It's only a matter
of time, my brother.

697
01:01:45,788 --> 01:01:48,341
Well, time, my little brother,
is something we don't have.

698
01:01:54,012 --> 01:01:56,597
I'm just gonna take
matters into my own hands.

699
01:02:15,196 --> 01:02:17,138
Look,

700
01:02:17,212 --> 01:02:18,706
all I do know is that...

701
01:02:20,444 --> 01:02:23,346
any time something
bad's happened to you...

702
01:02:24,892 --> 01:02:26,321
or our family...

703
01:02:28,764 --> 01:02:30,225
it's been because of me.

704
01:02:31,356 --> 01:02:32,949
It feels like...

705
01:02:34,940 --> 01:02:38,202
Put the guns down
or he's the first to die.

706
01:02:38,268 --> 01:02:40,985
Don't, Mich, don't.

707
01:02:41,052 --> 01:02:42,481
Now!

708
01:02:47,964 --> 01:02:49,371
Mich!

709
01:02:52,572 --> 01:02:55,289
Down.

710
01:02:55,356 --> 01:02:57,079
That's it.

711
01:02:57,147 --> 01:02:58,576
Now back off.

712
01:03:00,092 --> 01:03:02,612
Did you think
I was gonna be killed

713
01:03:02,684 --> 01:03:04,724
without a fight?

714
01:03:05,883 --> 01:03:08,404
Rotten bitch.

715
01:03:08,476 --> 01:03:10,679
- Mich!
- What'd you say?!

716
01:03:10,748 --> 01:03:12,438
Nothing?

717
01:03:12,507 --> 01:03:14,395
Where are your big words now?

718
01:03:22,588 --> 01:03:24,530
Is little brother
peeing in his pants now?

719
01:03:26,108 --> 01:03:27,602
Look what your sister did.

720
01:03:28,827 --> 01:03:32,472
I want my face to be
the last thing you see

721
01:03:32,540 --> 01:03:34,449
before I put a bullet in yours.

722
01:03:36,380 --> 01:03:39,828
But first, I'm gonna make sure you
keep those pretty little eyes open.

723
01:04:08,988 --> 01:04:10,898
Fuck!

724
01:04:21,019 --> 01:04:22,546
I'm sorry.

725
01:04:24,124 --> 01:04:26,011
It's okay.

726
01:04:26,075 --> 01:04:28,312
Jackie...

727
01:04:29,756 --> 01:04:31,763
I'm sorry.

728
01:04:33,243 --> 01:04:34,999
I told you this wasn't...

729
01:04:36,444 --> 01:04:38,266
I told you.

730
01:04:42,076 --> 01:04:43,450
Mich?

731
01:04:43,515 --> 01:04:45,206
Mich?!

732
01:05:19,387 --> 01:05:21,242
- Of all the stupid...
- Shut up, Abraham.

733
01:05:21,307 --> 01:05:23,446
Why the hell did you try to use
The Transcoder again?

734
01:05:23,516 --> 01:05:24,978
Look what you've done to yourself.

735
01:05:25,051 --> 01:05:27,124
What was I supposed to do,
sit here and do nothing?

736
01:05:27,196 --> 01:05:29,051
What if you had damaged
The Transcoder?

737
01:05:29,116 --> 01:05:31,963
All our plans would
have been ruined.

738
01:05:33,244 --> 01:05:34,869
Calm down, my boy.

739
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:38,550
- What the hell are you?
- She is my sister.

740
01:05:41,628 --> 01:05:44,278
You were supposed to help us!

741
01:05:44,347 --> 01:05:45,908
Michelle works for me.

742
01:05:45,980 --> 01:05:47,321
I owe her nothing.

743
01:05:47,388 --> 01:05:49,111
Or you.

744
01:05:49,180 --> 01:05:50,936
Now listen to me.

745
01:05:51,003 --> 01:05:52,978
I need you to do
something very important.

746
01:05:53,052 --> 01:05:55,124
What makes you think...

747
01:05:55,196 --> 01:05:57,749
I'd do anything for you?

748
01:05:57,820 --> 01:06:00,089
Michelle failed to meet
the final requirement

749
01:06:00,155 --> 01:06:02,065
to obtain her tickets to Demeter.

750
01:06:02,139 --> 01:06:04,114
All that hard work,

751
01:06:04,188 --> 01:06:06,490
shame for her to lose her chance now.

752
01:06:06,556 --> 01:06:08,214
But you, Jackie...

753
01:06:08,283 --> 01:06:10,869
you can complete her mission

754
01:06:10,940 --> 01:06:12,914
and guarantee her future

755
01:06:12,987 --> 01:06:14,678
as well as yours.

756
01:06:15,963 --> 01:06:17,785
Michelle can still be saved, kid.

757
01:06:19,067 --> 01:06:20,628
You tried so hard to fit in,

758
01:06:20,700 --> 01:06:22,423
to make things right.

759
01:06:22,491 --> 01:06:25,361
All Michelle ever did
was cause heartache.

760
01:06:25,436 --> 01:06:27,857
She doesn't know how to do it.

761
01:06:28,892 --> 01:06:30,899
She doesn't know you try.

762
01:06:30,971 --> 01:06:33,524
But now is your time to prove it,
prove you are a man

763
01:06:33,596 --> 01:06:36,629
and not a baby anymore.

764
01:06:36,699 --> 01:06:41,075
The world is yours, my friend.

765
01:06:46,268 --> 01:06:48,406
All right, all right, all right.

766
01:06:48,476 --> 01:06:50,264
Look at me. Look at me.

767
01:06:50,331 --> 01:06:51,957
You're all right.

768
01:06:53,692 --> 01:06:56,823
Okay. Good.

769
01:06:56,891 --> 01:06:58,964
Now does this hurt?

770
01:06:59,035 --> 01:07:00,661
Does it?

771
01:07:03,867 --> 01:07:06,584
- How did you do that?
- I upped your immune system a little.

772
01:07:06,651 --> 01:07:08,888
Your blood will regenerate
more quickly, okay?

773
01:07:08,956 --> 01:07:10,614
So rest up.

774
01:07:10,683 --> 01:07:12,723
Come on.

775
01:07:12,796 --> 01:07:14,389
That's it. Come on.

776
01:07:17,692 --> 01:07:20,026
And then, later on, you can kill me
for saving your life.

777
01:07:23,483 --> 01:07:25,938
I only found you because
of the GPS on your phone.

778
01:07:26,011 --> 01:07:27,572
When you'd been beeping

779
01:07:27,644 --> 01:07:29,618
for just over an hour on the same spot,

780
01:07:29,691 --> 01:07:31,284
I figured something was wrong.

781
01:07:53,147 --> 01:07:54,838
Christian.

782
01:08:04,476 --> 01:08:06,614
Thank you.

783
01:08:07,739 --> 01:08:10,128
Thank you.

784
01:08:17,276 --> 01:08:18,836
Hi.

785
01:08:19,867 --> 01:08:21,329
Hi.

786
01:08:25,531 --> 01:08:27,124
Jackie.

787
01:08:27,195 --> 01:08:28,624
Hey!

788
01:08:32,443 --> 01:08:34,418
God, man, you just disappeared.

789
01:08:39,227 --> 01:08:40,656
What's going on, Jackie?

790
01:08:42,843 --> 01:08:46,039
Oh, nothing. I, uh... wait.

791
01:08:46,108 --> 01:08:48,628
I... I got something for you. Here.

792
01:08:48,700 --> 01:08:50,871
Oh, God, no.
You're not gambling again.

793
01:08:50,939 --> 01:08:53,208
Hey, no, all right?
That's totally legit.

794
01:08:53,275 --> 01:08:55,544
All right, just take it.
I want you to have it.

795
01:08:55,612 --> 01:08:57,270
- No, I don't want it.
- Take it.

796
01:08:59,067 --> 01:09:01,784
Just use it to get some new gear.

797
01:09:01,851 --> 01:09:03,826
New goggles.

798
01:09:05,691 --> 01:09:07,349
I missed you, man.

799
01:09:12,444 --> 01:09:14,451
Sure you can't hang out a little later?

800
01:09:14,523 --> 01:09:16,595
Yeah, no, I...

801
01:09:21,467 --> 01:09:23,889
I'm... I'm proud of you.

802
01:09:27,644 --> 01:09:29,531
You're the best bro I've ever had.

803
01:09:31,771 --> 01:09:33,364
I want you to have a...

804
01:09:34,428 --> 01:09:36,250
a good life.

805
01:09:36,315 --> 01:09:37,908
Just, uh...

806
01:09:39,324 --> 01:09:41,211
don't screw it up, okay?

807
01:10:01,308 --> 01:10:03,064
I brought you some clothes.

808
01:10:03,131 --> 01:10:04,822
Thank you.

809
01:10:05,883 --> 01:10:07,574
You should ease up.

810
01:10:08,763 --> 01:10:11,895
I need to get better.
I have to find Jackie.

811
01:10:11,964 --> 01:10:14,681
I've uploaded all of Jackie's
information onto the "M" people list,

812
01:10:14,748 --> 01:10:16,275
so if anybody's seen him,
they'll call.

813
01:10:16,347 --> 01:10:18,420
Well, I can't stay here.

814
01:10:18,491 --> 01:10:19,920
What if someone calls, Michelle?

815
01:10:19,996 --> 01:10:22,713
Wouldn't you be here?

816
01:10:26,108 --> 01:10:28,693
Listen, there's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

817
01:10:35,067 --> 01:10:36,889
What is this?

818
01:10:36,955 --> 01:10:38,930
These are travel documents.

819
01:10:42,076 --> 01:10:43,766
I want you to come with me.

820
01:10:50,043 --> 01:10:52,432
Christian, I...

821
01:10:54,331 --> 01:10:55,892
I would love to.

822
01:11:00,220 --> 01:11:02,675
- But I must find Jackie.
- And what if Jackie's dead?

823
01:11:03,995 --> 01:11:05,784
Well, he's not.

824
01:11:06,875 --> 01:11:08,402
I can feel it.

825
01:11:14,747 --> 01:11:17,944
Well, if you change your mind...

826
01:11:20,283 --> 01:11:22,039
they'll always be here.

827
01:11:29,179 --> 01:11:30,804
Goodbye.

828
01:13:57,147 --> 01:13:58,576
Jackie.

829
01:13:59,803 --> 01:14:01,712
Michelle's been looking
all over for you.

830
01:14:01,787 --> 01:14:04,438
- Where have you been?
- Doing what I needed to get done.

831
01:14:10,011 --> 01:14:11,953
Don't make this hard on me
and I promise you,

832
01:14:12,027 --> 01:14:14,394
this will be over soon.

833
01:14:14,459 --> 01:14:16,368
What are you doing?
This is insane.

834
01:14:16,443 --> 01:14:18,483
I'm living my life that's right.

835
01:14:18,555 --> 01:14:20,889
- What are you talking about?
- Put him down, Jackie!

836
01:14:22,715 --> 01:14:24,570
- Put him down.
- What?

837
01:14:25,595 --> 01:14:27,766
What are you gonna do,
shoot me?

838
01:14:34,683 --> 01:14:37,236
Listen to me, I'm your sister.

839
01:14:37,307 --> 01:14:39,511
- I know what's best.
- No!

840
01:14:39,579 --> 01:14:41,335
You don't know anything!

841
01:14:41,403 --> 01:14:43,290
You don't know how I feel!

842
01:14:43,355 --> 01:14:45,395
You don't know how
I'm feeling right now!

843
01:15:23,163 --> 01:15:24,886
How'd it go?

844
01:15:36,795 --> 01:15:39,697
- We have a job for you.
- Go to hell.

845
01:15:39,771 --> 01:15:43,416
- No way I'm doing anything for you.
- Christian...

846
01:15:43,483 --> 01:15:46,297
it's been awhile.

847
01:15:46,363 --> 01:15:49,177
I apologize we couldn't
meet under better conditions.

848
01:15:49,243 --> 01:15:50,737
Josephine...

849
01:15:50,811 --> 01:15:53,112
You were expecting
someone else?

850
01:15:55,931 --> 01:15:58,681
- My God.
- You know what I need you for.

851
01:15:58,747 --> 01:16:02,359
Give me the code
for The Transcoder.

852
01:16:02,427 --> 01:16:05,012
In exchange, I will provide to you

853
01:16:05,083 --> 01:16:08,596
the calibration shift
as a sign of my goodwill.

854
01:16:08,667 --> 01:16:10,674
This... this model
is made from scrap.

855
01:16:12,091 --> 01:16:14,360
I don't know if the new chip
is sophisticated enough to...

856
01:16:14,427 --> 01:16:17,144
Oh, you know it will work.

857
01:16:17,211 --> 01:16:18,772
You can't leave me here.

858
01:16:18,842 --> 01:16:20,882
You don't know
what I've been through.

859
01:16:20,955 --> 01:16:22,865
Still...

860
01:16:22,939 --> 01:16:25,426
I don't know if I can
repair all of the damage.

861
01:16:25,499 --> 01:16:27,387
Just heal me enough

862
01:16:27,451 --> 01:16:30,517
so I may leave Olympia
and find better treatment.

863
01:16:32,859 --> 01:16:34,517
Maybe even continue in our research

864
01:16:34,587 --> 01:16:36,310
on The Transcoder.

865
01:16:36,379 --> 01:16:38,997
This time, for medical use.

866
01:16:40,219 --> 01:16:42,804
I was foolish to think
it could be a weapon.

867
01:16:42,875 --> 01:16:46,290
But with the lessons I learned,
I can use my resources

868
01:16:46,363 --> 01:16:48,468
for the better of mankind.

869
01:16:49,883 --> 01:16:53,298
You know in your heart,
you still have it in you, Christian.

870
01:16:55,195 --> 01:16:57,748
Help me so I can help you.

871
01:16:59,579 --> 01:17:03,124
Together with me,
we can do it together again...

872
01:17:03,195 --> 01:17:04,919
right, this time.

873
01:17:06,075 --> 01:17:08,279
Whatever happens,

874
01:17:08,347 --> 01:17:10,584
I'm here with you till the end.

875
01:17:21,179 --> 01:17:22,903
You...

876
01:17:22,971 --> 01:17:25,142
you killed my brother.

877
01:17:25,211 --> 01:17:27,000
And you just killed my sister.

878
01:17:27,067 --> 01:17:28,954
I guess we're even.

879
01:17:32,923 --> 01:17:36,468
- Go ahead, shoot me.
- You leave her alone.

880
01:17:36,539 --> 01:17:39,059
Shut up! I want you to use
that Transcoder of yours

881
01:17:39,130 --> 01:17:41,586
to bring back the original data code.

882
01:17:41,658 --> 01:17:44,408
- You're out of your mind if you think...
- I said do it now!

883
01:17:47,675 --> 01:17:49,780
Do it or the bitch dies!

884
01:17:56,058 --> 01:17:58,360
Fine.

885
01:17:58,427 --> 01:18:01,624
- I'll try.
- You'd better do more than try.

886
01:18:32,827 --> 01:18:34,518
How's this for trying?

887
01:18:38,491 --> 01:18:40,728
Christian! What the hell?

888
01:18:44,187 --> 01:18:46,707
Don't, you stupid bitch!

889
01:18:49,627 --> 01:18:51,252
Hiyah!

890
01:19:03,643 --> 01:19:06,360
Michelle.

891
01:19:06,427 --> 01:19:08,020
Christian.

892
01:19:08,091 --> 01:19:09,946
Destroy The Transcoder.

893
01:19:10,011 --> 01:19:11,505
What happened?

894
01:19:12,858 --> 01:19:15,346
If I can't use it as
a weapon, then no one can.

895
01:19:17,787 --> 01:19:19,510
Please don't die on me, please.

896
01:19:19,578 --> 01:19:21,302
No!

897
01:19:22,779 --> 01:19:24,339
Help me.

898
01:19:33,755 --> 01:19:37,911
Please... help me.

899
01:19:40,891 --> 01:19:42,833
Oh, Christian, please don't...

900
01:19:42,907 --> 01:19:44,533
don't leave me, please.

901
01:19:49,338 --> 01:19:51,640
Please don't leave me.

902
01:19:51,707 --> 01:19:53,976
I don't want to lose you.

903
01:20:00,058 --> 01:20:01,749
Do it for me.

904
01:20:05,818 --> 01:20:07,477
I love you.

905
01:27:50,266 --> 01:27:53,136
# Drug me up
and crucify me #

906
01:27:53,210 --> 01:27:55,153
# I want to feel nothing #

907
01:27:55,226 --> 01:27:57,648
# But your betrayal #

908
01:27:58,714 --> 01:28:00,951
# Nail me down
and medicate #

909
01:28:01,018 --> 01:28:03,189
# What I'd assassinate #

910
01:28:03,258 --> 01:28:06,390
# If I weren't so frail #

911
01:28:15,738 --> 01:28:18,127
# What is another black hole #

912
01:28:18,202 --> 01:28:21,333
# To a dead sky's stars? #

913
01:28:24,218 --> 01:28:26,106
# What is a fresh wound #

914
01:28:26,170 --> 01:28:29,715
# To a body so full of scars? #

915
01:28:32,954 --> 01:28:35,856
# Bleed me out
and purify me #

916
01:28:35,930 --> 01:28:39,792
# I'm in need of cleansing
of what I've failed #

917
01:28:41,242 --> 01:28:43,730
# Sail me down
the ocean's face #

918
01:28:43,802 --> 01:28:45,842
# So I confront my fate #

919
01:28:45,915 --> 01:28:49,078
# In a ghost storm gale #

920
01:28:51,130 --> 01:28:53,170
# I will rise #

921
01:28:55,482 --> 01:28:58,482
# I will find #

922
01:28:59,578 --> 01:29:01,782
# Room to grow #

923
01:29:03,962 --> 01:29:07,126
# Or a place to die #

924
01:29:08,346 --> 01:29:10,386
# I will rise #

925
01:29:12,602 --> 01:29:16,115
# I will find #

926
01:29:16,187 --> 01:29:19,056
# Room to grow #

927
01:29:21,083 --> 01:29:24,312
# Or a place to die #

928
01:30:20,922 --> 01:30:22,831
# It's decay #

929
01:30:22,906 --> 01:30:24,597
# In their eyes #

930
01:30:24,666 --> 01:30:26,641
# Widow black #

931
01:30:26,714 --> 01:30:30,970
# Withered white, I... #

932
01:30:31,034 --> 01:30:34,995
# Hope they see #

933
01:30:35,066 --> 01:30:37,487
# The price of deceit #

934
01:30:37,562 --> 01:30:39,449
# Rot away #

935
01:30:39,514 --> 01:30:41,586
# In my mind #

936
01:30:41,658 --> 01:30:43,731
# Don't look back #

937
01:30:43,802 --> 01:30:48,057
# Don't deny we all have #

938
01:30:48,122 --> 01:30:51,024
# What you'd call #

939
01:30:51,098 --> 01:30:52,691
# Demons #

940
01:30:52,762 --> 01:30:55,479
# I will rise #

941
01:30:56,826 --> 01:30:59,477
# I will find #

942
01:31:00,762 --> 01:31:03,991
# Room to grow #

943
01:31:05,786 --> 01:31:08,568
# Or a place to die #

944
01:31:09,786 --> 01:31:12,601
# I will rise #

945
01:31:14,010 --> 01:31:16,629
# I will find #

946
01:31:17,914 --> 01:31:19,986
# Room to grow #

947
01:31:22,362 --> 01:31:25,907
# Or a place to die. #
