1
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:31,154
Hello, hello, this is Johnny Rizzo

2
00:00:31,291 --> 00:00:36,048
joining you on the overnight
on the K-Spot, sports talk, KSPT!

3
00:00:36,187 --> 00:00:38,129
How's everyone doing tonight?
I'm gonna be with you

4
00:00:38,267 --> 00:00:40,885
from 2:00 to 6:00
for all you insomniacs out there

5
00:00:41,018 --> 00:00:42,611
that have a lot to talk about.

6
00:00:42,747 --> 00:00:45,649
So let's jump right in
and take our first caller.

7
00:00:45,787 --> 00:00:47,248
Brian, from Danville.

8
00:00:47,386 --> 00:00:49,623
How you doing, my man?
What would you like to talk about?

9
00:00:49,754 --> 00:00:52,057
Look, I know our beloved A's
aren't having the best summer.

10
00:00:52,187 --> 00:00:54,708
But unlike some other guys,
I'm not gonna use my air time

11
00:00:54,844 --> 00:00:57,048
to rip them apart, all right?
I'm a loyal fan.

12
00:00:57,179 --> 00:01:00,049
Instead, I'm gonna encourage everyone
going out to the Coliseum tonight

13
00:01:00,188 --> 00:01:03,930
to show a little support, okay?
Send a little love to my man Gio;

14
00:01:04,059 --> 00:01:05,336
spread the love, not the hate.

15
00:01:05,467 --> 00:01:07,572
Don't get me started
on the Warriors, okay?

16
00:01:07,708 --> 00:01:10,096
I'm already hella-mad
the way they treated Mullin.

17
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,624
I'm not just saying that
because Chris, like myself,

18
00:01:12,764 --> 00:01:14,193
is another transplanted New Yorker,

19
00:01:14,332 --> 00:01:16,022
I'm saying it because
he was a class act.

20
00:01:16,156 --> 00:01:18,545
You really want to talk steroids
scandal with me? That's fine.

21
00:01:18,684 --> 00:01:21,334
I know what you're gonna say
and I'm not being too harsh -

22
00:01:21,468 --> 00:01:23,126
look, when a player takes steroids,

23
00:01:23,259 --> 00:01:25,528
they are violating
the integrity of the game.

24
00:01:25,660 --> 00:01:27,121
It's cheating. Okay?
So, look, fellas,

25
00:01:27,259 --> 00:01:29,463
you wanna take a banned substance,
go for it.

26
00:01:29,596 --> 00:01:31,865
But that means
no hall of fame for you.

27
00:01:31,995 --> 00:01:33,337
The Tour de France! Really?

28
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:35,705
You want me
to talk about bike riding?

29
00:01:35,836 --> 00:01:38,138
This is a sports show! Next caller!

30
00:01:38,268 --> 00:01:39,697
Whoop, that's my fiancée.

31
00:01:41,629 --> 00:01:44,214
<i>- She says you gotta hustle off.
You've got a flight to catch.</i>

32
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:45,810
- It's 6:00 already! Wow!

33
00:01:45,948 --> 00:01:48,534
Time flies when you're having fun,
sports fans.

34
00:01:48,668 --> 00:01:51,254
This is Johnny Rizzo
saying goodbye, good morning!

35
00:01:51,388 --> 00:01:52,664
I'm out!

36
00:01:54,268 --> 00:01:55,642
Good show, good show!

37
00:01:59,548 --> 00:02:00,825
See you, Jimmy.

38
00:02:13,468 --> 00:02:15,988
Just give me 10 minutes!
Please, 10 minutes!

39
00:02:17,949 --> 00:02:19,258
Hey, baby.
- Hi.

40
00:02:19,389 --> 00:02:20,698
- I'm late! I'm late. I'm sorry.

41
00:02:20,829 --> 00:02:23,218
- I dunno why you decided
to work last night, Johnny.

42
00:02:23,357 --> 00:02:25,561
You're gonna miss your flight.
The cab's already here.

43
00:02:25,694 --> 00:02:27,417
- I know. I saw him.
- And you forgot

44
00:02:27,549 --> 00:02:28,597
to pack your suit, didn't you?

45
00:02:28,733 --> 00:02:30,358
- No, I did. It's in there.
- And a tie?

46
00:02:30,494 --> 00:02:33,177
'Cause this is a business meeting
with businessmen,

47
00:02:33,309 --> 00:02:35,731
not a whole bunch of sports nerds.
Seriously, you need to wear a suit.

48
00:02:35,869 --> 00:02:38,040
- Baby, I'm gonna wear a suit,
just not a tie.

49
00:02:38,174 --> 00:02:41,076
- Okay. I think
you look really good in a suit.

50
00:02:41,213 --> 00:02:43,384
All right, come here
and say goodbye to me.

51
00:02:46,781 --> 00:02:49,781
Thank you, thank you,
thank you so much for doing this.

52
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:53,171
And I know it's not how you envisioned
your career going,

53
00:02:53,309 --> 00:02:54,422
but if you get this job,

54
00:02:54,557 --> 00:02:56,858
we're going to be back in New York
right after the honeymoon.

55
00:02:56,989 --> 00:02:59,160
Right? It's a good thing.
- Yeah...

56
00:02:59,293 --> 00:03:01,083
- Now give me a kiss.
- I gotta go.

57
00:03:02,462 --> 00:03:05,659
- Okay, you can go now.
Ahem. Um...

58
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:10,067
Do you really want to wear that hat?
It sorta makes you look like a toddler.

59
00:03:10,206 --> 00:03:12,662
- I like the hat.
- Um... no. Take it off.

60
00:03:13,630 --> 00:03:17,078
Okay, and you have dinner
with my parents on Sunday night.

61
00:03:17,214 --> 00:03:18,229
- Right.
- And please

62
00:03:18,366 --> 00:03:19,991
call my father ''Dr. Meadows,'' okay?

63
00:03:20,126 --> 00:03:23,192
He does not like to be called ''Mister.''
Can you remember that?

64
00:03:23,326 --> 00:03:26,490
- I called him ''Mister'' one time.
- Yeah, and it really pissed him off.

65
00:03:26,622 --> 00:03:28,444
- He's only a shrink, though.
- Whoa.

66
00:03:28,574 --> 00:03:31,607
Okay, look, it's the least you can do
considering he got you

67
00:03:31,742 --> 00:03:33,335
this job interview.
- Fair enough.

68
00:03:33,470 --> 00:03:35,771
- All right, here's the address
for the shop.

69
00:03:35,902 --> 00:03:39,382
That's in Nolita, which is downtown.
It's not too far from the hotel. Okay?

70
00:03:39,517 --> 00:03:41,143
- Got it. I promise.
- Thank you.

71
00:03:41,278 --> 00:03:43,133
All right.
- I love you. I'll see you.

72
00:03:43,261 --> 00:03:45,629
I'll call you when I get there, yeah?
Cool.

73
00:03:46,271 --> 00:03:49,467
<i>It's a voice in the back of your mind</i>

74
00:03:50,975 --> 00:03:52,885
<i>Oh oh oh oh oh oh</i>

75
00:03:53,631 --> 00:03:56,500
<i>It's a song
It's a beautiful rhyme</i>

76
00:03:57,951 --> 00:04:00,024
<i>Oh oh oh oh oh oh</i>

77
00:04:00,671 --> 00:04:04,151
<i>It gets louder and louder each time</i>

78
00:04:05,151 --> 00:04:07,387
<i>Oh oh oh oh oh oh</i>

79
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,219
<i>It's a sign that you find me all right</i>

80
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:16,700
<i>Oh oh oh oh oh oh
Step outside and off the bus</i>

81
00:04:16,831 --> 00:04:20,693
<i>There's more to life
there's more to us</i>

82
00:04:20,831 --> 00:04:24,060
<i>The window is open wide</i>

83
00:04:25,471 --> 00:04:27,228
<i>Open for more</i>

84
00:04:28,096 --> 00:04:30,943
<i>Oh oh oh
Open for more</i>

85
00:04:31,071 --> 00:04:32,697
<i>Oh oh oh</i>

86
00:04:32,831 --> 00:04:34,773
<i>Open for more</i>

87
00:04:34,911 --> 00:04:36,373
<i>Oh oh oh</i>

88
00:04:36,511 --> 00:04:38,202
<i>Open for more</i>

89
00:04:38,335 --> 00:04:39,862
<i>Oh oh oh</i>

90
00:04:52,672 --> 00:04:55,257
- Hey, hey! Look who's back!
- Terry!

91
00:04:55,392 --> 00:04:58,937
- There he is!
All right, buddy, sit your ass down.

92
00:04:59,072 --> 00:05:01,788
- Thank you, sir.
- Have yourself a drink.

93
00:05:02,431 --> 00:05:04,700
And do me a favour,
take off that ridiculous hat.

94
00:05:04,832 --> 00:05:06,457
You're in New York now, all right?

95
00:05:07,072 --> 00:05:09,177
- Actually, can I grab a beer?
Is that okay?

96
00:05:09,311 --> 00:05:11,417
- No, you're not gonna have a beer,
you're gonna have a real drink

97
00:05:11,552 --> 00:05:13,527
and we're gonna have a real conversation
about what's really going on.

98
00:05:13,664 --> 00:05:16,086
- What do you mean,
''what's really going on?''

99
00:05:16,225 --> 00:05:19,007
- You're getting married in a few weeks
and I'd like to know why exactly.

100
00:05:19,137 --> 00:05:20,893
- Because I love her?

101
00:05:21,025 --> 00:05:22,912
- Because you love her.
Look, that goes without saying.

102
00:05:23,041 --> 00:05:25,375
But that doesn't mean
you have to marry her, my man.

103
00:05:25,505 --> 00:05:28,025
So what happened? You got
caught up in the moment one night,

104
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,167
go deep, forget to throw a glove on?
- No.

105
00:05:30,305 --> 00:05:33,338
No, no. I always ''throw a glove on,''
thank you for your concern.

106
00:05:33,472 --> 00:05:36,669
Just, uh... I think it's a good time.
- Look,

107
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:38,458
take it from one who's been there.

108
00:05:38,593 --> 00:05:40,862
Never a good time.
- Oh, great.

109
00:05:40,992 --> 00:05:42,847
- Never!
- I disagree.

110
00:05:42,976 --> 00:05:44,569
See, I think If you love someone,
why wait?

111
00:05:44,704 --> 00:05:45,752
You should just go for it,

112
00:05:45,888 --> 00:05:48,092
you know, get on with your life.
- Get on with your life?

113
00:05:48,224 --> 00:05:49,980
Listen to yourself, young blood,
all right?

114
00:05:50,112 --> 00:05:52,927
Life is like a marathon.
It's not the 100-yard dash.

115
00:05:53,057 --> 00:05:55,960
It's like that single-malt scotch
I just poured you, right?

116
00:05:56,097 --> 00:05:58,944
You sip it. You don't shoot it.
- Colourful.

117
00:05:59,073 --> 00:06:01,277
But I'm not a young blood anymore,
Uncle Terry.

118
00:06:01,409 --> 00:06:03,449
I'm gonna be 25 next month.
(Terry laughing)

119
00:06:03,585 --> 00:06:05,887
- Well, la-di-fucking-da.
Twenty-five? My man,

120
00:06:06,017 --> 00:06:09,334
these are your prime years
to go out there and make it happen.

121
00:06:09,474 --> 00:06:13,183
Did you not notice all the fine ass
on the street walking over here?

122
00:06:13,314 --> 00:06:14,775
- Yeah, I noticed
all the fine ass on the street.

123
00:06:14,913 --> 00:06:16,026
- I actually don't think you did,

124
00:06:16,161 --> 00:06:18,976
because there's a bevy of horny honeys
out there and you know what they want?

125
00:06:19,105 --> 00:06:20,960
- What do they want?
- They want their pound of flesh.

126
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:23,129
And you know who they're expecting
to give it to them?

127
00:06:23,265 --> 00:06:24,924
- Who are they expecting's
gonna give it to them?

128
00:06:25,057 --> 00:06:25,984
- You.
- Me? No, you!

129
00:06:26,113 --> 00:06:28,698
You can, okay? Be my guest.
I'm not that guy.

130
00:06:28,833 --> 00:06:31,167
Besides, Claire and I
have been together since college.

131
00:06:31,297 --> 00:06:32,672
I love her.
- Whoa, whoa.

132
00:06:32,801 --> 00:06:36,096
You have been with the same chick
since college?

133
00:06:36,225 --> 00:06:38,168
- Yeah. You met her, actually,
at my graduation party.

134
00:06:38,306 --> 00:06:40,510
- This is heartbreaking, Johnny.
That is the only piece of ass

135
00:06:40,642 --> 00:06:42,977
you've had since then?
- Okay, she's not a piece of ass.

136
00:06:43,106 --> 00:06:44,448
All right? That's my fiancée.
- Fine.

137
00:06:44,578 --> 00:06:46,139
My apologies, all right?
- Okay.

138
00:06:46,274 --> 00:06:49,372
- But here's what your Uncle Terry
is gonna do for you this weekend.

139
00:06:49,506 --> 00:06:51,393
All right, a little wedding gift for you.

140
00:06:51,522 --> 00:06:53,725
I'm gonna take you out,
get you some strange.

141
00:06:53,858 --> 00:06:56,225
- No, I don't really need
that wedding gift. I'm good, thanks.

142
00:06:56,354 --> 00:06:58,558
- How about I get you a BJ, then.

143
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:00,097
I know some chick--
- BJ!?

144
00:07:00,226 --> 00:07:01,753
No BJ! No. All right?

145
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:03,799
Claire takes care of me.
- Fine.

146
00:07:03,938 --> 00:07:06,305
All right... Here's a thought instead.

147
00:07:06,434 --> 00:07:08,343
You're going out to your mother's
for lunch tomorrow, right?

148
00:07:08,482 --> 00:07:09,889
- Right...
- So what do you say

149
00:07:10,018 --> 00:07:11,840
you let me drive you out there,

150
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,880
afterwards, we'll power out
to the Hamptons

151
00:07:14,018 --> 00:07:15,392
for the weekend?
- It sounds like fun,

152
00:07:15,521 --> 00:07:16,765
uncle Terry. It does.
It's just...

153
00:07:16,898 --> 00:07:18,970
I got some errands
I told Claire I would run.

154
00:07:19,106 --> 00:07:21,660
- Wh-what kind of errands
do you have to run for Claire?

155
00:07:21,795 --> 00:07:24,828
- She wants me to pick up
a handbag, or something,

156
00:07:24,963 --> 00:07:26,524
at some special shop downtown.

157
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:28,066
- Okay, my man, that settles it.

158
00:07:28,195 --> 00:07:30,748
I am picking you up at your hotel,
9:00 a.m. sharp,

159
00:07:30,882 --> 00:07:33,403
tomorrow morning.
- I know what you're trying to do,

160
00:07:33,539 --> 00:07:35,579
Uncle Terry,
and I'm not interested, okay?

161
00:07:35,715 --> 00:07:37,242
- Wait, you're not interested

162
00:07:37,379 --> 00:07:40,925
in spending a little quality time
with your uncle?

163
00:07:41,059 --> 00:07:43,197
What would you rather do?
You're gonna spend two days

164
00:07:43,331 --> 00:07:45,720
in your shitty hotel room and do what?
I'm offended, man.

165
00:07:45,859 --> 00:07:47,768
- Okay, you don't stop, do you?
Thank you for the drink.

166
00:07:47,907 --> 00:07:48,801
I appreciate it.

167
00:07:48,931 --> 00:07:50,905
- Look, I wanna spend
a little time with my nephew!

168
00:07:51,042 --> 00:07:52,701
That such a bad thing?
- Next time. Okay?

169
00:07:52,835 --> 00:07:55,136
I'm gonna take the train to my mom's,
then I'm gonna get some rest.

170
00:07:55,267 --> 00:07:58,202
- What better way to get some rest
than to hang poolside with your uncle?

171
00:07:58,339 --> 00:08:00,477
Listen to me,
I'm not taking no for an answer.

172
00:08:00,994 --> 00:08:02,587
- All right. Okay. 9:00 a.m.?

173
00:08:02,722 --> 00:08:04,349
- Let's make it 10:00, all right?

174
00:08:04,483 --> 00:08:06,971
Just to be safe.
And do me a favour, lose the hat, okay?

175
00:08:07,108 --> 00:08:09,661
You're too young to get married,
and too old for that fucking hat.

176
00:08:09,795 --> 00:08:12,348
- Right. Thank you.
I'll see you tomorrow, all right?

177
00:08:17,444 --> 00:08:18,905
(honking horn)

178
00:08:26,275 --> 00:08:27,704
- There he is!

179
00:08:28,995 --> 00:08:30,784
What do you say, buddy?
- What's going on?

180
00:08:30,915 --> 00:08:32,476
- How you doing, man?
- What's your deal?

181
00:08:32,612 --> 00:08:33,724
You did say 10:00.

182
00:08:33,860 --> 00:08:36,249
Because I said 9:00,
you said 10:00, then--

183
00:08:36,388 --> 00:08:39,170
- I apologize, I got a, uh...
I got a phone call last night

184
00:08:39,299 --> 00:08:41,438
from this girl I know.
She's out in Jersey, so...

185
00:08:41,571 --> 00:08:43,905
You could say I hit
a little tunnel traffic this morning,

186
00:08:44,036 --> 00:08:46,077
if you know what I mean.
- Tunnel traffic. Nice.

187
00:08:46,213 --> 00:08:47,140
- Look, by the way,

188
00:08:47,269 --> 00:08:48,796
what the hell are you
doing staying in this dump?

189
00:08:48,933 --> 00:08:50,656
- I got a good deal online, so...
- Do me a favour,

190
00:08:50,789 --> 00:08:53,025
next time you come to New York,
do your uncle a favour,

191
00:08:53,156 --> 00:08:55,098
give me a call,
let me hook you up, okay?

192
00:08:55,237 --> 00:08:57,146
- All right. Thank you. Thanks.

193
00:08:57,636 --> 00:08:59,905
Look, you don't mind
if we head downtown first, right?

194
00:09:00,036 --> 00:09:01,924
Pick up the handbag?
- Let me ask you a question.

195
00:09:02,052 --> 00:09:03,940
What would happen if you returned home
without this... pocketbook?

196
00:09:04,068 --> 00:09:05,890
- Well, I wouldn't be
a man of my word.

197
00:09:06,021 --> 00:09:07,843
Would I?
- A man of your word?

198
00:09:07,973 --> 00:09:10,787
- Yeah, I told Claire I'd pick it up.
So I should really honour that promise.

199
00:09:10,917 --> 00:09:14,943
- Okay. Well, I'd hate for you
to have to compromise your integrity.

200
00:09:15,076 --> 00:09:17,018
Let's go get your bag.

201
00:09:20,836 --> 00:09:22,265
(rock music)

202
00:09:29,797 --> 00:09:32,350
- There. Took like two seconds.
- Yeah, you're a standup guy.

203
00:09:32,486 --> 00:09:35,071
Can we go now?
- Yes. Did you get me one?

204
00:09:35,718 --> 00:09:37,660
- You like ice cream?

205
00:09:49,477 --> 00:09:50,491
Johnny, listen to me.

206
00:09:50,630 --> 00:09:52,484
I don't want to spend
a lot of time here, all right?

207
00:09:52,613 --> 00:09:54,784
'Cause I told the ladies
we'd get out to the beach by 4:00.

208
00:09:54,917 --> 00:09:55,845
- Ladies?
What are you talking about?

209
00:09:55,973 --> 00:09:57,981
You said it was just gonna be us
hanging by the pool.

210
00:09:58,117 --> 00:09:59,775
- Yeah, it is just going to be us.

211
00:09:59,909 --> 00:10:02,014
And this sweet little thing
I met last week, so...

212
00:10:02,150 --> 00:10:04,538
- No, you said ''ladies.''
You said ''ladies'' just now. Plural.

213
00:10:04,678 --> 00:10:06,783
- Look, I'm assuming
she must have some friends.

214
00:10:06,917 --> 00:10:10,146
Or maybe one friend in particular,
who I heard is very hot.

215
00:10:10,277 --> 00:10:12,132
Look, I know,
you don't even need to talk to her.

216
00:10:12,262 --> 00:10:14,019
I know you don't roll that way.
So it's cool.

217
00:10:14,150 --> 00:10:15,197
Don't even worry about it.

218
00:10:15,334 --> 00:10:17,189
- No, that's not cool!
That's not cool, Uncle Terry, okay?

219
00:10:17,318 --> 00:10:19,140
If you're trying to set me up,
I'm not down.

220
00:10:19,270 --> 00:10:21,278
Don't be a dickwad!
- What do you mean a ''dickwad?''

221
00:10:21,414 --> 00:10:23,519
- You're being a dickwad, okay!
If that's what you have planned,

222
00:10:23,654 --> 00:10:27,003
I'm not going!
- I'm joking around with you, all right?

223
00:10:27,142 --> 00:10:28,549
- A toast, to Johnny.

224
00:10:28,678 --> 00:10:30,501
I'm so proud of you,

225
00:10:30,630 --> 00:10:31,972
my baby boy.

226
00:10:32,102 --> 00:10:33,858
Agreeing to take this job.

227
00:10:33,991 --> 00:10:36,543
That takes courage.
- What is this job

228
00:10:36,678 --> 00:10:38,620
that you two are so excited about?

229
00:10:38,758 --> 00:10:40,929
<i>- It's a good opportunity.
- No, it's a great opportunity.</i>

230
00:10:41,062 --> 00:10:42,011
- It's a good opportunity.

231
00:10:42,150 --> 00:10:44,037
It's something Claire set up for me -
or her dad, rather.

232
00:10:44,166 --> 00:10:46,370
- You know what I'm not hearing
in your voice at all? Excitement.

233
00:10:46,502 --> 00:10:49,797
- Yeah, it's not exactly what I wanna be
doing, but the money's potentially good.

234
00:10:49,926 --> 00:10:52,959
Gets me back to New York. So...
- Yes, and that makes his mother

235
00:10:53,094 --> 00:10:55,428
very happy. Right?
- And Claire and I have an agreement

236
00:10:55,558 --> 00:10:58,374
that, um, when I turn 25,
if I'm not making $50,000,

237
00:10:58,503 --> 00:11:00,837
I'd let her dad set me up
with an interview

238
00:11:00,967 --> 00:11:03,007
at his friend's company.
- Whoa, wait a second.

239
00:11:03,143 --> 00:11:05,565
So this job has nothing to do
with sports or radio,

240
00:11:05,703 --> 00:11:07,077
or anything that you care about?

241
00:11:07,207 --> 00:11:08,668
- No. It's, um...

242
00:11:08,806 --> 00:11:13,346
for Moving Made Easy Cardboard
Box and Corrugated Products.

243
00:11:13,479 --> 00:11:17,669
- They do boxes, packing supplies,
shipping cartons, things of that nature.

244
00:11:17,798 --> 00:11:20,384
It's a great opportunity, Johnny.
- To say nothing of the benefits.

245
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:23,367
- It's cardboard fucking boxes, though?
I heard that correctly?

246
00:11:23,495 --> 00:11:26,365
Cardboard boxes?
What the fuck are you thinking, man?!

247
00:11:26,503 --> 00:11:29,699
- Hey, it's a good job. And good money.
- It's not. Know what a good job is?

248
00:11:29,831 --> 00:11:31,903
Talking sports on the radio.
That's a great job.

249
00:11:32,039 --> 00:11:34,625
Every other dude in America
would love to have that gig

250
00:11:34,759 --> 00:11:36,133
and you're gonna walk away from that?!

251
00:11:36,263 --> 00:11:37,823
- Clogging the airways
with mindless debates

252
00:11:37,958 --> 00:11:40,676
about who should be batting fifth
in the Giants lineup?

253
00:11:40,808 --> 00:11:44,069
It's hardly a job. It's a hobby at best.

254
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:45,858
- Yeah, I'm with you guys.
It's an awesome job.

255
00:11:45,992 --> 00:11:48,065
Okay, I love it.
But it's not gonna pay the bills.

256
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,923
- So you move
into a smaller apartment.

257
00:11:50,056 --> 00:11:52,096
Eat out less.
Take the bus on occasion.

258
00:11:52,232 --> 00:11:53,857
- Right.
- You realize you're encouraging him

259
00:11:53,992 --> 00:11:56,512
to stunt his personal growth?
To remain a child.

260
00:11:56,648 --> 00:11:58,819
Do you really want him
to end up like you?

261
00:11:58,952 --> 00:12:00,545
Still running around
like some horny teenager?

262
00:12:00,680 --> 00:12:02,436
- Hey, jealousy
will get you nowhere, Frank.

263
00:12:02,567 --> 00:12:05,251
- Are you insinuating
I wanna sleep with other women?

264
00:12:05,384 --> 00:12:08,067
I'm married to your sister,
you animal.

265
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:10,272
- Let me ask you a question.
Why are you doing this?

266
00:12:10,407 --> 00:12:12,546
- I gave her my word,
Uncle Terry, okay?

267
00:12:12,679 --> 00:12:15,429
- If I'm not making $50,000--
- Yeah, yeah. I know.

268
00:12:15,559 --> 00:12:18,014
Who came up with this timeline for you?
- We did.

269
00:12:18,152 --> 00:12:20,039
- Bullshit!
- We did together, okay?

270
00:12:20,168 --> 00:12:22,754
- Why do you need
to be making $50,000 right now?

271
00:12:22,888 --> 00:12:23,816
- Because he's getting married!

272
00:12:23,944 --> 00:12:27,075
And they wanna start a family, you know.
And all that costs money.

273
00:12:27,209 --> 00:12:28,900
- This is bad, Johnny.
This is real bad.

274
00:12:29,033 --> 00:12:31,815
I do not like what I'm hearing at all.
This whole job situation,

275
00:12:31,945 --> 00:12:33,733
not a good thing.
- I appreciate the thought.

276
00:12:33,865 --> 00:12:36,614
But I dunno why we're talking
about this. I've made my mind up.

277
00:12:36,745 --> 00:12:39,494
On Monday, I'm going to the interview
and if I'm lucky, I'll get the job.

278
00:12:39,624 --> 00:12:41,894
- Atta boy!
- All right, guys, well, thank you.

279
00:12:42,025 --> 00:12:44,327
That was a blast, as always.
- Bye.

280
00:12:44,456 --> 00:12:47,423
Hey, listen. No funny business
with your uncle, okay?

281
00:12:47,561 --> 00:12:50,310
No wild parties.
- Mm-hmm. We got it.

282
00:12:50,441 --> 00:12:52,448
- He's a good boy. Don't corrupt him.
- Don't worry about it.

283
00:12:52,585 --> 00:12:55,138
We're just gonna get some sun, alright?
- Listen,

284
00:12:55,272 --> 00:12:58,174
call me on Monday after your interview.
I wanna hear how it goes. Bye.

285
00:12:58,312 --> 00:13:00,003
- You got it. I love you.
- Be good.

286
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,302
That's to you!
- Cheer up, Frank!

287
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:04,033
It's not that bad, buddy!

288
00:13:09,161 --> 00:13:11,136
Now, look,
I know she's you're mother, okay?

289
00:13:11,274 --> 00:13:14,787
She's also my sister and I know her
a little bit better than you.

290
00:13:14,921 --> 00:13:16,350
Take it easy, sis!

291
00:13:17,321 --> 00:13:19,907
She wants you to get a blowjob
this weekend.

292
00:13:20,041 --> 00:13:21,503
- Really?
- You know that.

293
00:13:21,641 --> 00:13:23,746
- Really? That's nice. That's my mom.

294
00:13:23,881 --> 00:13:26,663
<i>(music)
But you got a smile</i>

295
00:13:26,794 --> 00:13:28,354
<i>On you honey</i>

296
00:13:29,321 --> 00:13:33,631
<i>And you got eyes
that'll light up the night</i>

297
00:13:34,505 --> 00:13:36,578
<i>Now they're winnin'me over</i>

298
00:13:36,713 --> 00:13:39,560
<i>Lettin'me know</i>

299
00:13:39,689 --> 00:13:42,624
<i>There's something else</i>

300
00:13:42,761 --> 00:13:44,452
<i>Something more...</i>

301
00:13:44,585 --> 00:13:46,243
So this lady friend we're visiting,

302
00:13:46,377 --> 00:13:48,680
obviously not the same one
from last night?

303
00:13:49,546 --> 00:13:51,401
- What can I say, man?
I'm a lucky man.

304
00:13:51,530 --> 00:13:53,865
- So I guess it's safe to assume
this isn't gonna blossom

305
00:13:53,994 --> 00:13:55,620
into a serious
and meaningful relationship.

306
00:13:55,754 --> 00:13:59,299
- Well, as serious and meaningful as
one can get with someone who's married.

307
00:13:59,435 --> 00:14:02,784
- Wow! You know what?
Good for you. Good for you, Uncle Terry.

308
00:14:02,922 --> 00:14:06,086
- Look, as shocking as this may sound,
man, it happens all the time.

309
00:14:06,218 --> 00:14:09,185
- But don't you feel bad for her husband?
- Her husband? Uh... no.

310
00:14:09,322 --> 00:14:12,322
Why exactly would I feel badly for him?
- Because he probably doesn't know

311
00:14:12,458 --> 00:14:15,273
someone's having sex with his wife.
- Yeah, I should fucking hope not!

312
00:14:15,402 --> 00:14:17,289
- No, it's wrong, Uncle Terry.
It's cheating! It's cheating.

313
00:14:17,419 --> 00:14:19,906
You're engaging in deceit and deception.
That can't feel good for you.

314
00:14:20,042 --> 00:14:23,272
- It feels fine. In fact, I got a hard-on
right now thinking about it.

315
00:14:23,402 --> 00:14:24,831
- Oh, wow. That's nice.

316
00:14:28,202 --> 00:14:30,438
- All right... finally here!

317
00:14:31,082 --> 00:14:32,512
And only an hour late.

318
00:14:36,523 --> 00:14:38,116
- Look, Uncle Terry...

319
00:14:39,083 --> 00:14:41,505
Can I just wait here, please?
- No, you're not gonna wait here.

320
00:14:41,643 --> 00:14:43,683
You're gonna come inside
and say hello like a gentleman.

321
00:14:43,819 --> 00:14:46,240
- Oh, ''like a gentleman.''
That's choice words coming from a guy

322
00:14:46,379 --> 00:14:48,800
that said he had a raging hard-on
a couple minutes ago.

323
00:14:48,939 --> 00:14:51,361
That's a married woman in there, okay?
And you're having an affair

324
00:14:51,499 --> 00:14:53,735
with said married woman.
- I'm not asking you to take pictures!

325
00:14:53,867 --> 00:14:57,183
- And what do you want me to do
when you go in there and start...

326
00:14:57,323 --> 00:14:59,462
fornicating.
- We're not gonna do anything right now.

327
00:14:59,595 --> 00:15:03,392
We're gonna go in and say hello.
Come on. They're out back playing tennis.

328
00:15:04,043 --> 00:15:06,050
- I'm just gonna say hello.
Then I'm gonna leave.

329
00:15:06,187 --> 00:15:08,194
- Where you gonna go?
- Just gonna wait out front.

330
00:15:08,331 --> 00:15:11,014
- Come on. Don't worry.
Got a little surprise back here for you.

331
00:15:11,147 --> 00:15:12,837
I think you're going to enjoy yourself.

332
00:15:16,524 --> 00:15:17,734
There they are.

333
00:15:17,868 --> 00:15:19,690
- Great.
- Oh, Jesus, look at her.

334
00:15:19,820 --> 00:15:23,814
Is that a fucking sight, or what?
- Please tell me your lady friend

335
00:15:23,948 --> 00:15:26,468
is not the young blond?
- No, my man.

336
00:15:26,604 --> 00:15:28,392
She is for you.

337
00:15:28,524 --> 00:15:29,571
Amy!

338
00:15:30,604 --> 00:15:32,513
- Hey, Terry! Back here!

339
00:15:40,524 --> 00:15:42,728
(Terry laughing)
- Look at you, breaking a sweat.

340
00:15:42,860 --> 00:15:44,867
- Terry, hey.
- What do you say, doll?

341
00:15:45,004 --> 00:15:47,273
- This must be your nephew.
- This is him.

342
00:15:47,404 --> 00:15:49,990
The nicest guy in showbiz.
Meet DJ Johnny Rizzo.

343
00:15:50,124 --> 00:15:51,433
- I'm Amy.
- Hi.

344
00:15:51,563 --> 00:15:53,473
- And this is Brooke.
My tennis instructor,

345
00:15:53,612 --> 00:15:56,711
who's been having a fine time
kicking my ass all afternoon.

346
00:15:56,844 --> 00:15:58,633
Brooke, Terry, Johnny.
- Hey, guys.

347
00:15:58,765 --> 00:16:01,547
- How are you?
- So why don't you guys hit some balls

348
00:16:01,676 --> 00:16:04,459
while Terry and I run inside real quick.
I... thought maybe

349
00:16:04,589 --> 00:16:07,623
we could talk about that project?
- Oh, the project, yeah. Good idea.

350
00:16:07,757 --> 00:16:10,626
I was actually just telling Johnny
about that project, wasn't I?

351
00:16:10,764 --> 00:16:12,226
- He was.
- All right.

352
00:16:12,365 --> 00:16:13,991
- Come on. Hit 'em dead, pal.

353
00:16:14,125 --> 00:16:16,034
- Have fun.
- See ya.

354
00:16:17,932 --> 00:16:19,426
- Nice choice. She's a knockout.
- Yeah.

355
00:16:19,564 --> 00:16:22,881
But promise me he's not an asshole.
- He's a terrific guy. Sexual dynamo.

356
00:16:23,021 --> 00:16:24,646
Runs in the family.
(Amy laughing)

357
00:16:28,844 --> 00:16:31,714
- So you're a DJ.
- Yep.

358
00:16:31,853 --> 00:16:34,308
- That's cool.
- Uh, yeah. Thanks.

359
00:16:34,445 --> 00:16:37,194
I don't, like, spin records
or anything like that. I, uh...

360
00:16:37,325 --> 00:16:39,430
I have a sports talk show,
in California.

361
00:16:39,564 --> 00:16:41,954
- Oh.
- It's... I do it like in Oakland.

362
00:16:42,605 --> 00:16:45,191
Kinda like a suburb...
- Okay.

363
00:16:45,325 --> 00:16:48,195
- ... Oakland? KSPT. ''The K-Spot!''

364
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:53,224
- Well, that's cooler
than if you were, like,

365
00:16:53,357 --> 00:16:56,521
one of those loser nightclub DJs.
- Thank you.

366
00:16:59,406 --> 00:17:01,511
- So what are you doing
in the Hamptons?

367
00:17:01,645 --> 00:17:04,133
- Uh, I have a job interview, actually,
on Monday.

368
00:17:04,269 --> 00:17:05,643
Not for radio, something else.

369
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:09,090
I got really lucky - my fiancée's dad
found me a great opportunity.

370
00:17:09,229 --> 00:17:12,077
Make a little bit more money
with some benefits, so...

371
00:17:12,205 --> 00:17:13,831
I'm excited...

372
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:15,426
- I'm sorry...

373
00:17:15,566 --> 00:17:17,508
Did you just say your fiancée?
- Yeah.

374
00:17:17,646 --> 00:17:19,751
Yeah, I'm getting married
in a couple of weeks.

375
00:17:19,885 --> 00:17:22,635
- Wow, congratulations!
- Thanks. Thank you.

376
00:17:22,765 --> 00:17:25,483
- So weird, and kind of a relief.
I'm just...

377
00:17:26,126 --> 00:17:28,548
I thought we were being set up.
- Oh, no.

378
00:17:28,686 --> 00:17:30,726
No, no, no, no, no.
No, that's my uncle.

379
00:17:30,862 --> 00:17:33,350
He's an asshole.
He thinks I'm too young to get married.

380
00:17:33,486 --> 00:17:35,308
So he's been bustin' my balls
all weekend.

381
00:17:35,439 --> 00:17:37,479
- Well, are you too young
to be getting married?

382
00:17:37,614 --> 00:17:40,712
- No. No, I'm not too young.
- You look young. How old are you?

383
00:17:40,846 --> 00:17:42,307
Almost 25. Thanks.

384
00:17:42,446 --> 00:17:44,618
- Dude, that is too young
to be getting married.

385
00:17:44,750 --> 00:17:47,139
- That's not too young!
Why does everyone keep saying that?

386
00:17:47,278 --> 00:17:50,661
My parents got married at that age!
-Yeah, how'd that work out for them?

387
00:17:50,799 --> 00:17:53,581
- Okay. Okay, fair enough.
They got divorced when I was eight.

388
00:17:53,710 --> 00:17:56,198
- See? I told you,
too young to get married.

389
00:17:56,334 --> 00:18:00,229
It was the same for me.
My parents got divorced when I was nine.

390
00:18:00,366 --> 00:18:02,952
It's why my shrink says
I only date jerks.

391
00:18:03,086 --> 00:18:04,515
- Ah. Okay.

392
00:18:06,926 --> 00:18:10,756
- Amy said that Terry said
that you are nice to a fault.

393
00:18:11,727 --> 00:18:13,156
- Sounds like him.

394
00:18:13,807 --> 00:18:16,076
- Is that true? Are you nice to a fault?

395
00:18:16,207 --> 00:18:18,924
- I dunno. I mean,
is that such a bad thing?

396
00:18:20,175 --> 00:18:23,110
- All right, Nice Guy Johnny,
let's hit some balls.

397
00:18:23,247 --> 00:18:25,035
- Uh... Ooh... Okay.

398
00:18:25,167 --> 00:18:26,760
(Brooke laughing)
(Johnny chuckling)

399
00:18:27,727 --> 00:18:30,149
It's okay.
I didn't think I'd be doing this!

400
00:18:30,287 --> 00:18:32,524
- That one was high.
- Wow, swinging for the fences there.

401
00:18:32,655 --> 00:18:35,110
- I don't really talk about tennis
on my show, but, uh...

402
00:18:35,247 --> 00:18:37,833
I got a new respect for it,
I'll tell you that.

403
00:18:37,967 --> 00:18:40,269
- You should stop talking about sports
and maybe start playing them.

404
00:18:40,399 --> 00:18:43,247
- Thanks.
Thanks for the positive reinforcement.

405
00:18:43,375 --> 00:18:46,342
- How do you have any credibility
with your listeners?

406
00:18:47,087 --> 00:18:49,453
- I didn't know I was gonna
come here to work out.

407
00:18:49,583 --> 00:18:51,591
If I knew I was,
I would've properly prepared.

408
00:18:51,728 --> 00:18:53,997
(laughing)
- Working out?

409
00:18:54,128 --> 00:18:56,997
You call that working out?
- This is hard work, yes!

410
00:18:57,808 --> 00:18:59,334
- You're sucking so hard,

411
00:18:59,472 --> 00:19:01,675
is that what's such a workout for ya?

412
00:19:01,808 --> 00:19:03,880
- I'm done.
How do you turn it off?

413
00:19:04,015 --> 00:19:05,325
(laughing)

414
00:19:06,768 --> 00:19:08,590
- You might be a nice guy,

415
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,923
but you're a terrible
fucking tennis player.

416
00:19:11,728 --> 00:19:13,157
- Guilty.
(chuckling)

417
00:19:18,767 --> 00:19:20,677
It's hard. It's hard.
(Brooke laughing)

418
00:19:21,040 --> 00:19:24,040
It was nice meeting you guys.
- Nice to meet you too.

419
00:19:24,175 --> 00:19:25,801
- Take care.
- All right. Bye, guys.

420
00:19:25,936 --> 00:19:27,278
- Pleasure.
- I'll see you later.

421
00:19:27,407 --> 00:19:28,869
- You most definitely will.
- Hmm.

422
00:19:29,008 --> 00:19:30,983
- How was that for you?

423
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:33,990
- You tell me.
- Oh, awesome. He's engaged.

424
00:19:34,128 --> 00:19:35,437
- No!

425
00:19:35,569 --> 00:19:36,845
Oh, Terry.

426
00:19:37,776 --> 00:19:41,038
- You said we were just gonna say hello.
Why did you have to leave me alone

427
00:19:41,169 --> 00:19:43,176
with some strange girl?
- Strange? What's so strange about her?

428
00:19:43,313 --> 00:19:44,720
She seemed like a delightful young lady.

429
00:19:44,848 --> 00:19:46,671
- She was an awful tennis instructor,
for one thing.

430
00:19:46,801 --> 00:19:48,808
And I know what you're doing,
and I'm not cool.

431
00:19:48,944 --> 00:19:50,767
- What am I trying to do?
- I'm getting married

432
00:19:50,897 --> 00:19:53,744
in a couple of weeks, okay?
I know you don't believe in the vows,

433
00:19:53,873 --> 00:19:56,109
or whatever. But I do.
So I'd appreciate if you'd refrain

434
00:19:56,241 --> 00:19:59,088
from setting me up with people, okay?
- Does that mean no double date tonight?

435
00:19:59,217 --> 00:20:01,453
- That's really funny. Do me a favour?
Quit the bullshit, okay?

436
00:20:01,585 --> 00:20:03,178
- Look, you're allowed
to flirt a little bit.

437
00:20:03,313 --> 00:20:06,160
No one's saying you had to sleep
with the girl, but have some fun.

438
00:20:06,289 --> 00:20:08,710
Walk up to the line.
- No, I don't wanna have any fun,

439
00:20:08,848 --> 00:20:11,270
to walk up to some line.
- Can you please at least admit

440
00:20:11,409 --> 00:20:13,416
you thought she was hot.
I'm not spending my weekend

441
00:20:13,552 --> 00:20:15,560
with some closet fruitcake.
- No, I'm not participating in this.

442
00:20:15,697 --> 00:20:18,764
- I need to know that you can recognize
that was a smoking-hot gorgeous gal.

443
00:20:18,897 --> 00:20:21,963
- No, not doing this with you.
- So you're saying she's a dog?

444
00:20:22,930 --> 00:20:25,996
- She wasn't a dog.
- There he is! All right, there's my guy.

445
00:20:26,129 --> 00:20:27,885
He's not a fruitcake. Let's go.

446
00:20:33,330 --> 00:20:34,759
(pop music)

447
00:20:55,729 --> 00:20:58,598
Jesus, what a freaking gorgeous day, huh?

448
00:21:00,211 --> 00:21:02,928
I hope you brought a suit, my man.
- Yeah, I dunno.

449
00:21:03,058 --> 00:21:05,840
I think I'm gonna go for a jog later.
It's nice.

450
00:21:05,971 --> 00:21:09,418
- All right, suit yourself.
I am gonna have a beer,

451
00:21:09,554 --> 00:21:12,369
smoke a stogie and jump in that pool.

452
00:21:13,874 --> 00:21:16,241
- Oh, Uncle Terry, this is beautiful.

453
00:21:16,370 --> 00:21:18,280
- Ah... thank you, man.

454
00:21:19,410 --> 00:21:22,607
It is a pretty sweet pad, isn't it?
- Yeah, I'm impressed.

455
00:21:23,411 --> 00:21:25,199
- All right, so look, man, uh...

456
00:21:25,331 --> 00:21:28,364
your bedroom is upstairs,
it's the first door on the right.

457
00:21:28,498 --> 00:21:32,906
And I think it actually has pink sheets,
which you are going to love, I imagine.

458
00:21:33,042 --> 00:21:35,595
<i>So make yourself comfortable.
My casa es su casa.</i>

459
00:21:35,730 --> 00:21:37,323
- Thank you.
- I...

460
00:21:38,450 --> 00:21:39,879
... need to go for a swim.

461
00:22:09,651 --> 00:22:11,112
<i>- Hey, baby, it's me.
- Where are you?</i>

462
00:22:11,251 --> 00:22:12,233
I just spoke to your mother.

463
00:22:12,371 --> 00:22:14,281
Why didn't you tell me
you were going to the Hamptons?

464
00:22:14,419 --> 00:22:16,808
- Yeah, I'm sorry.
It was kind of a last-minute decision.

465
00:22:16,947 --> 00:22:19,402
I really didn't know I was going
until like this afternoon.

466
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:22,539
- So this was just
a spur-of-the-moment decision?

467
00:22:22,675 --> 00:22:24,236
<i>- Yeah, basically. I mean, uh...</i>

468
00:22:24,371 --> 00:22:27,471
my uncle drove me to my parents' house,
then invited me to come, so...

469
00:22:27,604 --> 00:22:29,840
- Okay, did you at least
check out of the hotel?

470
00:22:29,972 --> 00:22:33,485
<i>- No.
- So we are paying for a hotel</i>

471
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:35,759
<i>that you're not using tonight?
- Yeah. Sorry. Like I said,</i>

472
00:22:35,892 --> 00:22:38,674
it was spur of the moment.
I can call and probably check out,

473
00:22:38,804 --> 00:22:41,041
if you want.
But I have some stuff still there.

474
00:22:41,172 --> 00:22:42,514
<i>Think it'll be a problem?</i>

475
00:22:42,644 --> 00:22:44,532
- Alright.
This is what I'm talking about.

476
00:22:44,660 --> 00:22:47,956
It's all connected. You seriously got
to start behaving like a grownup.

477
00:22:48,084 --> 00:22:51,118
<i>This is exactly why a real job
with real people</i>

478
00:22:51,252 --> 00:22:53,707
<i>will have a real good effect on you.</i>

479
00:22:53,844 --> 00:22:55,819
I'm not being a bitch.
I'm just trying to help.

480
00:22:55,956 --> 00:22:57,200
<i>- Yeah, it'll have a good effect.</i>

481
00:22:57,332 --> 00:23:00,082
- So... where are you staying?

482
00:23:00,212 --> 00:23:01,489
- At my uncle's.

483
00:23:02,132 --> 00:23:04,434
- How the hell can he afford
a house in the Hamptons?

484
00:23:04,564 --> 00:23:06,833
<i>Is it nice?
- Yeah, actually. It's really nice.</i>

485
00:23:06,964 --> 00:23:09,353
- He's such a fucking sleazebag.
Did I ever tell you he tried

486
00:23:09,493 --> 00:23:11,882
<i>to hit on me at our graduation party?
- What?I No, he didn't.</i>

487
00:23:12,021 --> 00:23:14,225
- Yes, he did. I mean,
he wasn't being overt or anything,

488
00:23:14,357 --> 00:23:16,266
but he was definitely
putting the feelers out there.

489
00:23:16,404 --> 00:23:18,314
- Are you sure?
He was probably just flirting with you.

490
00:23:18,453 --> 00:23:19,663
He's kind of a big flirt.

491
00:23:20,053 --> 00:23:21,514
<i>- No, I know the difference.</i>

492
00:23:21,652 --> 00:23:23,725
between flirting and getting hit on.
Trust me. Happens all the time.

493
00:23:23,861 --> 00:23:25,355
<i>Okay, whatever, Johnny.</i>

494
00:23:25,492 --> 00:23:28,340
Just, seriously, please promise me
that you will be back in the city

495
00:23:28,469 --> 00:23:30,476
in time for dinner with my parents
tomorrow night.

496
00:23:30,613 --> 00:23:31,987
<i>- Yes, of course.
- Promise?</i>

497
00:23:32,116 --> 00:23:33,327
- Yes. Yes.

498
00:23:33,461 --> 00:23:36,243
- Okay. I love you and I trust you.

499
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:37,802
- I love you too.

500
00:23:50,293 --> 00:23:54,123
I just got off the phone with Claire;
you hit on her at our graduation party?

501
00:23:54,262 --> 00:23:56,367
- Who says this?
- Claire.

502
00:23:57,302 --> 00:24:00,368
My fiancée? Wow, you are an idiot!
You hit on her?

503
00:24:00,502 --> 00:24:02,738
- I did not hit on her!
I... talked to her.

504
00:24:02,870 --> 00:24:04,725
Maybe I flirted with her a little bit.

505
00:24:04,853 --> 00:24:06,446
But come on, who cares?
- I care!

506
00:24:06,581 --> 00:24:08,403
That's my fiancée! That's not cool!

507
00:24:08,534 --> 00:24:11,567
- I'm not allowed to tell a sexy woman
I thought she looked beautiful?

508
00:24:11,702 --> 00:24:15,411
- No! Not when that woman's my fiancée
and I'm your nephew! That's wrong!

509
00:24:15,542 --> 00:24:18,062
- But it was harmless, man.
I wasn't gonna actually act on it.

510
00:24:18,197 --> 00:24:20,586
- I should hope not!
But I'm not so sure with you.

511
00:24:20,725 --> 00:24:24,238
- Why not just take it as a compliment,
the two of you?

512
00:24:24,373 --> 00:24:26,545
- Thanks for hitting on my fiancée
to pay me a compliment.

513
00:24:26,678 --> 00:24:28,271
You know what? This was a mistake.

514
00:24:28,405 --> 00:24:31,722
I'm gonna go for my jog,
then take the train into the city, okay?

515
00:24:33,813 --> 00:24:35,275
- Fine, man. Fine.

516
00:24:35,414 --> 00:24:38,066
It has been a pleasure, Johnny.
- Yeah.

517
00:24:38,199 --> 00:24:39,726
Thanks for everything, Uncle Terry.

518
00:24:46,775 --> 00:24:46,839
(music)

519
00:24:46,839 --> 00:24:48,049
(music)

520
00:25:01,014 --> 00:25:02,291
<i>- Excuse meI</i>

521
00:25:02,422 --> 00:25:04,364
Hey! You!

522
00:25:06,294 --> 00:25:08,912
- What can I do for you?
- You can start by telling me

523
00:25:09,046 --> 00:25:11,250
who you are.
- I don't like your tone at all, pal.

524
00:25:11,383 --> 00:25:13,237
Why don't you tell me
who you are first?

525
00:25:13,367 --> 00:25:18,004
- I'll tell you who I am.
I am the caretaker of this property.

526
00:25:18,134 --> 00:25:20,753
I look after the house
for Roseanne Giordano.

527
00:25:20,888 --> 00:25:23,735
- Good for you. I happen to be
a very dear friend of Roseanne's.

528
00:25:23,863 --> 00:25:26,482
- And I happen to be a very dear friend
of her husband's.

529
00:25:26,615 --> 00:25:28,687
- So maybe you'd like
a fucking medal for that!

530
00:25:28,824 --> 00:25:31,857
- There's no need to get hostile.
I saw a car out front I didn't recognize,

531
00:25:31,991 --> 00:25:35,090
I thought I should come and take a look.
Is that all right with you?

532
00:25:35,223 --> 00:25:38,572
- So aren't you the good neighbour?
Well, now that you have taken a look,

533
00:25:38,711 --> 00:25:40,435
why don't you take a fucking hike,

534
00:25:40,567 --> 00:25:41,996
as well?

535
00:25:42,135 --> 00:25:46,161
- Oh, you are quite rude, aren't you?
Yes, well, I think I'll call Roseanne,

536
00:25:46,295 --> 00:25:49,524
or maybe her husband
and check up on you, Mr. Um...?

537
00:25:49,655 --> 00:25:50,964
- Cunningham.

538
00:25:51,095 --> 00:25:52,688
Terry Cunningham.
- Yes.

539
00:25:53,015 --> 00:25:54,804
All right, well, excuse me for a moment.

540
00:25:54,935 --> 00:25:57,553
- Go make your call.
- Hello, Roseanne.

541
00:25:57,687 --> 00:26:00,370
Yes, sorry to disturb you,
but Terry Cunningham

542
00:26:00,503 --> 00:26:03,887
<i>is here at the house.
- Are you fuckingjoking me?</i>

543
00:26:04,024 --> 00:26:06,129
He's there right now?
- Yes, he's standing there right now,

544
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,436
by the pool, drinking a beer.
What should I do?

545
00:26:08,568 --> 00:26:11,765
<i>Shall I call the cops?
- No, no, no. Don't do that.</i>

546
00:26:11,896 --> 00:26:13,805
Hmm... Let me talk to him.

547
00:26:15,096 --> 00:26:16,209
- All right.

548
00:26:17,656 --> 00:26:19,892
Roseanne would like to talk to you.

549
00:26:22,136 --> 00:26:23,958
<i>- What you say, doll?
- TerryI</i>

550
00:26:24,088 --> 00:26:26,674
What the fuck is going on?
What are you doing at my house?

551
00:26:26,808 --> 00:26:30,452
- Look, I was in the neighbourhood
and I figured I'd come by to say hello.

552
00:26:30,584 --> 00:26:33,333
I knocked on the door
and I thought I heard something,

553
00:26:33,464 --> 00:26:35,220
<i>so I figured I should check it out.</i>

554
00:26:35,352 --> 00:26:37,654
- Right, then you thought
you'd just take a little swim?

555
00:26:37,784 --> 00:26:41,079
- I thought since no one was here,
what would be the harm?

556
00:26:41,208 --> 00:26:43,183
<i>- Do you realize how stupid this is?</i>

557
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,808
What if my husband
had been there this weekend?

558
00:26:45,945 --> 00:26:48,498
- Then I guess we'd have
some explaining to do, wouldn't we?

559
00:26:48,633 --> 00:26:50,062
<i>- Hey, I do not appreciate this.</i>

560
00:26:51,097 --> 00:26:53,747
You are taking advantage
of my generosity.

561
00:26:53,881 --> 00:26:55,823
<i>And we've talked about this before.</i>

562
00:26:55,961 --> 00:27:00,303
- Doll, I apologize. Just say the word
and I will leave. No problems.

563
00:27:00,440 --> 00:27:03,408
- You're such a pain in my ass,
you know that?

564
00:27:03,545 --> 00:27:06,414
- Does that mean I have to go,
because I was kinda hoping

565
00:27:06,552 --> 00:27:08,047
<i>I could spend the night.
- No.</i>

566
00:27:08,185 --> 00:27:11,152
You don't have to go.
You can only stay the night, though.

567
00:27:11,289 --> 00:27:13,078
Now let me talk to Mr. Williams.

568
00:27:13,209 --> 00:27:14,616
- With pleasure.

569
00:27:15,448 --> 00:27:17,750
- Oh. Thank you.

570
00:27:17,881 --> 00:27:19,026
Yes?

571
00:27:19,161 --> 00:27:21,430
- He can stay the night.
But you just have to make sure

572
00:27:21,560 --> 00:27:24,113
he's out first thing in the morning.
Can you make sure that happens?

573
00:27:24,249 --> 00:27:25,972
- Yes. How does 8:00 sound?

574
00:27:26,937 --> 00:27:29,327
Very good. Thank you, bye-bye.

575
00:27:30,842 --> 00:27:34,071
- I hope you're pleased with yourself?
- I'm just doing my job.

576
00:27:34,201 --> 00:27:36,590
And I'll have you know,
Roseanne wanted me

577
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:39,577
to tell you you had to be out of here
by 8:00 a.m.

578
00:27:39,705 --> 00:27:42,967
And wants me to come by in the morning
to make sure you have, in fact, left.

579
00:27:43,098 --> 00:27:45,553
- Nothing would make me happier
than to see your face

580
00:27:45,690 --> 00:27:48,690
at 8:00 a.m. tomorrow morning.
I look forward to it.

581
00:27:50,457 --> 00:27:52,050
- Smart arse, aren't you?

582
00:27:54,457 --> 00:27:56,083
I'll be back.

583
00:27:56,217 --> 00:27:57,711
Eight a.m.

584
00:27:57,849 --> 00:27:59,857
- Yeah, how do you like your eggs?

585
00:28:03,097 --> 00:28:03,162
(music)

586
00:28:03,162 --> 00:28:04,209
(music)

587
00:28:21,979 --> 00:28:23,735
- Hey...
- Hey!

588
00:28:24,699 --> 00:28:27,448
- What are you doing here?
- What am I doing here?

589
00:28:27,579 --> 00:28:29,237
What are you doing here?
This is my spot.

590
00:28:29,370 --> 00:28:32,370
- Sorry to intrude.
No, I'm just out for a jog.

591
00:28:32,506 --> 00:28:33,367
- You know what you should do,

592
00:28:33,499 --> 00:28:35,441
you should cut that run short
and come have a beer with me.

593
00:28:35,578 --> 00:28:38,131
- Oh, no, no. I'm good.
Thank you, though.

594
00:28:39,130 --> 00:28:42,840
- Oh, come on, it's just a beer.
Light beer, too. Only 95 calories.

595
00:28:42,970 --> 00:28:46,199
You can maintain your girlish figure.
- Oh, thank you.

596
00:28:46,331 --> 00:28:48,469
No. No, I'm engaged. I, uh...

597
00:28:48,603 --> 00:28:51,570
I don't think it would be appropriate.
- Wow!

598
00:28:51,706 --> 00:28:53,713
Don't you think that was
a little presumptuous of you?

599
00:28:53,851 --> 00:28:55,280
It's just a beer.
- I'm just saying...

600
00:28:55,420 --> 00:28:58,551
I'm sorry. I didn't mean it like that.
I'm just... I'm just saying.

601
00:28:58,683 --> 00:29:01,367
- Come on, don't be such a fucking wuss.
Come have a beer with me.

602
00:29:02,939 --> 00:29:05,427
- All right, one beer.
One beer, if you put it that way.

603
00:29:05,563 --> 00:29:07,254
- Grab a chair right here.
- You got it.

604
00:29:08,060 --> 00:29:09,653
- You got it?
- Thank you, yes.

605
00:29:10,139 --> 00:29:11,251
- All right...

606
00:29:11,900 --> 00:29:13,176
Here we go.

607
00:29:14,619 --> 00:29:16,180
- Oh, it's nice.
- Yeah.

608
00:29:16,315 --> 00:29:19,097
Look at those guys playing paddleball...

609
00:29:20,059 --> 00:29:21,336
(Johnny laughing)

610
00:29:31,771 --> 00:29:33,015
(music)

611
00:29:35,579 --> 00:29:38,002
<i>Sunshine</i>

612
00:29:38,140 --> 00:29:39,765
<i>She's Aquarius</i>

613
00:29:39,900 --> 00:29:42,136
<i>What what what a sign</i>

614
00:29:42,460 --> 00:29:44,762
<i>She came from the sky</i>

615
00:29:44,892 --> 00:29:46,802
<i>Oh oh oh oh</i>

616
00:29:46,940 --> 00:29:49,623
<i>She came from the sky
Oh oh oh oh</i>

617
00:29:51,260 --> 00:29:53,333
<i>Just like rain</i>

618
00:29:55,420 --> 00:29:57,492
<i>Just like rain</i>

619
00:29:59,420 --> 00:30:01,492
<i>Just like rain</i>

620
00:30:03,580 --> 00:30:05,107
<i>Just like rain</i>

621
00:30:09,500 --> 00:30:11,126
- Cold?
- Yeah, you should've joined me.

622
00:30:11,260 --> 00:30:13,016
<i>- No, thank you.
Just like</i>

623
00:30:13,820 --> 00:30:15,249
- You have a fresh beer?

624
00:30:15,388 --> 00:30:17,177
- Yes, I do.
- Ready?

625
00:30:18,780 --> 00:30:19,893
- Ah...

626
00:30:20,540 --> 00:30:21,915
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

627
00:30:26,461 --> 00:30:28,730
So what's the deal,
you live here year-round or...?

628
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:32,472
- Oh, no, me and my best friend from
school came out here for the summer.

629
00:30:32,605 --> 00:30:34,514
Her parents have a place
over in Montauk.

630
00:30:34,653 --> 00:30:36,311
- Oh, yeah?
Where'd you go to school?

631
00:30:36,445 --> 00:30:37,971
- Loyola Marymount - in L.A.?
- Yeah!

632
00:30:38,108 --> 00:30:40,443
I went to San Francisco State.
- Really?

633
00:30:40,573 --> 00:30:43,290
- Did you play tennis for them?
- Sure did.

634
00:30:43,421 --> 00:30:45,526
All Conference, singles and doubles.
- Wow!

635
00:30:45,661 --> 00:30:48,050
- In fact, I was a seeded player.

636
00:30:49,020 --> 00:30:52,152
But I gave it all up
for some jerk I was seeing.

637
00:30:52,285 --> 00:30:54,968
So that put an end to that dream.

638
00:30:55,101 --> 00:30:58,646
- I'm sorry. So that means
you're like a real jock, then.

639
00:30:58,781 --> 00:31:01,847
- Ah, my father wouldn't have it
any other way.

640
00:31:01,981 --> 00:31:04,851
- You know what?
I would love to get you on my show.

641
00:31:05,662 --> 00:31:08,182
Yeah. Yeah, I'd like to do
an interview, is that all right?

642
00:31:08,318 --> 00:31:11,035
I think it'd be really cool.
We could talk about how a, uh...

643
00:31:11,166 --> 00:31:12,180
college athlete, once they graduate,

644
00:31:12,317 --> 00:31:14,968
what happens then their sport
is no longer the centre of universe.

645
00:31:15,101 --> 00:31:17,371
I think that'd be kinda good.
Would you be down for that?

646
00:31:17,502 --> 00:31:19,127
- You must be hard up for guests.

647
00:31:19,262 --> 00:31:21,531
- Well, I go on air at 2:00 a.m.
So yeah, kinda.

648
00:31:21,661 --> 00:31:24,629
- Uh, my father'll be thrilled.
- All right.

649
00:31:24,766 --> 00:31:26,970
Okay. Okay, you got a deal.

650
00:31:27,102 --> 00:31:28,531
- Okay.
- Sold!

651
00:31:30,334 --> 00:31:32,985
- Hey, what if you end up
taking this job on Monday?

652
00:31:33,118 --> 00:31:36,085
I'm gonna miss out
on my 15 minutes of fame, aren't I?

653
00:31:36,221 --> 00:31:38,458
- Yeah... Yeah, I guess so.

654
00:31:39,134 --> 00:31:42,003
- All right, well, then, I am definitely
voting against that job.

655
00:31:42,941 --> 00:31:44,436
- You wouldn't be the only one,
believe me.

656
00:31:44,574 --> 00:31:46,963
- So what is this new career
opportunity anyhow?

657
00:31:47,102 --> 00:31:49,045
- Mm-mm. No, no, no.
If I tell you,

658
00:31:49,183 --> 00:31:50,776
you're gonna think
I'm a complete jackass.

659
00:31:50,911 --> 00:31:53,366
- It can't be that bad. What is it?
- Oh, it's that bad.

660
00:31:53,502 --> 00:31:54,811
- What is it?

661
00:31:54,943 --> 00:31:58,259
- It is for a warehouse-supervisor
position,

662
00:31:58,398 --> 00:32:02,773
for Moving Made Easy
Cardboard Box and Corrugated Products.

663
00:32:04,222 --> 00:32:06,678
- You cannot be serious?
- I'm serious. I'm serious.

664
00:32:06,815 --> 00:32:11,801
Look, it's not as cool as my DJ position,
but it easily triples my salary, so...

665
00:32:11,935 --> 00:32:16,212
- Listen, I know I just met you
and I do not know a thing about you,

666
00:32:16,350 --> 00:32:19,034
but just promise me
you will not take that job.

667
00:32:19,166 --> 00:32:22,101
I don't care how much they say
they're gonna pay you.

668
00:32:22,239 --> 00:32:24,214
- Yeah... It's a little late for that.

669
00:32:24,351 --> 00:32:25,944
But thank you for your concern.

670
00:32:37,503 --> 00:32:39,892
Well... thank you for the beer.

671
00:32:40,031 --> 00:32:43,097
This was nice. But I'm gonna head back.
I'm gonna try and make a train

672
00:32:43,231 --> 00:32:44,693
back into the city tonight.
- Oh, really?

673
00:32:45,343 --> 00:32:48,409
Are you sure you don't wanna stick
around? 'Cause me and my friends

674
00:32:48,543 --> 00:32:51,860
are having a bonfire down at the beach.
We're gonna grill up some food

675
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:54,204
and drink a little beer,
smoke a little weed...

676
00:32:54,335 --> 00:32:55,579
- Yeah, no. No, thank you.

677
00:32:55,711 --> 00:32:57,533
It sounds like fun, though.
- Oh, well...

678
00:32:57,663 --> 00:33:00,346
Could be your last chance
of a wild and crazy night

679
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:03,447
before you spend the rest of your life
neck-deep in cardboard.

680
00:33:03,583 --> 00:33:06,932
- Ah-ha. That's funny.
No, I'll take a rain check, though.

681
00:33:07,903 --> 00:33:09,464
- Suit yourself.
- All right.

682
00:33:09,599 --> 00:33:12,021
You can take these yourself?
- Oh, yeah, I got it.

683
00:33:12,160 --> 00:33:13,654
- Great, I'll see ya.
- Yeah, bye.

684
00:33:18,304 --> 00:33:21,850
Hey, if you change your mind,
we'll be over at Georgica Beach!

685
00:33:21,984 --> 00:33:23,261
- All right.

686
00:33:23,584 --> 00:33:25,013
I'll see ya.

687
00:33:26,176 --> 00:33:27,583
(soft music)

688
00:33:29,441 --> 00:33:31,961
<i>If you want to save the world
you better find yourself a girl</i>

689
00:33:32,096 --> 00:33:34,136
<i>Who doesn't mind</i>

690
00:33:35,904 --> 00:33:37,693
<i>I've been in love
I've been alone</i>

691
00:33:37,824 --> 00:33:41,654
<i>I've seen a million come and go
and I almost stopped trying</i>

692
00:33:42,944 --> 00:33:46,838
<i>But now that I found you
I find myself</i>

693
00:33:46,977 --> 00:33:49,180
<i>You could be the girl</i>

694
00:33:49,824 --> 00:33:52,093
<i>And you and I</i>

695
00:33:52,224 --> 00:33:54,461
<i>Could save the world</i>

696
00:34:06,625 --> 00:34:08,316
<i>In the summer of'07</i>

697
00:34:08,449 --> 00:34:11,581
<i>When I found there was heaven
in your heart</i>

698
00:34:13,185 --> 00:34:17,822
<i>I told you mine is on my sleeve
but it's easier to see it in the dark</i>

699
00:34:20,065 --> 00:34:22,935
<i>Don't you give it up
give it up give it up</i>

700
00:34:23,425 --> 00:34:26,294
<i>Don't you give it up give it up
give it up</i>

701
00:34:26,944 --> 00:34:29,661
<i>'Cause if you give it up
give it up give it up</i>

702
00:34:30,625 --> 00:34:33,659
<i>You've given up given up given up</i>

703
00:34:35,265 --> 00:34:36,858
<i>On the world</i>

704
00:34:50,626 --> 00:34:52,382
Yo, Jim, what's going on, man?

705
00:34:53,186 --> 00:34:54,876
Trip's going good.
I wanna check in,

706
00:34:55,010 --> 00:34:57,498
see how everything was going
with the show last night.

707
00:34:58,785 --> 00:34:59,768
Yeah...

708
00:34:59,906 --> 00:35:01,815
Yeah, he's good, man, you're right.

709
00:35:02,146 --> 00:35:05,179
I'm with you. Think he'll be
my replacement if I decide to leave?

710
00:35:06,946 --> 00:35:10,775
No, nothing's for sure yet, man.
I mean, the interview isn't till Monday.

711
00:35:11,746 --> 00:35:13,568
Set in stone?
Claire said that? No.

712
00:35:13,698 --> 00:35:17,178
No, man, nothing's set in stone.
I might not even take the job.

713
00:35:18,146 --> 00:35:19,258
Yeah...

714
00:35:19,586 --> 00:35:21,179
All right, I just wanna check in.

715
00:35:21,665 --> 00:35:23,903
Okay, man, I'll talk to you soon.
Take it easy.

716
00:35:26,466 --> 00:35:28,408
- Look who's still here.
What happened?

717
00:35:28,546 --> 00:35:30,651
Thought you had to get back
to the city.

718
00:35:30,787 --> 00:35:32,313
- I took a look
at the train schedule.

719
00:35:32,451 --> 00:35:33,792
There was no express trains
running tonight.

720
00:35:33,923 --> 00:35:35,778
I'd have to stop at Babylon,
transfer at Jamaica,

721
00:35:35,907 --> 00:35:37,216
wait an hour.
It wasn't worth it.

722
00:35:37,346 --> 00:35:39,419
- This had nothing to do
with the fact that you ran

723
00:35:39,554 --> 00:35:42,140
into that sweet little piece of ass
down at the beach, did it?

724
00:35:42,275 --> 00:35:45,821
- No! And her name is Brooke, by the way.
- Oh, really.

725
00:35:45,955 --> 00:35:47,133
Well, guess what -

726
00:35:47,267 --> 00:35:50,496
Amy told me
that Brooke really likes you.

727
00:35:50,626 --> 00:35:53,212
And that Brooke wants you to go
to this bonfire tonight.

728
00:35:53,346 --> 00:35:55,288
And I think that's a really good idea.

729
00:35:55,426 --> 00:35:59,965
- Yeah? Then can you do me a favour
and clean the shit out of your ears?

730
00:36:00,099 --> 00:36:02,684
Because I'm engaged. It's not happening.
- Yeah, I know,

731
00:36:02,819 --> 00:36:05,120
because you keep reminding me,
but guess what -

732
00:36:05,251 --> 00:36:08,732
you are not married yet. These are
your last moments of freedom,

733
00:36:08,867 --> 00:36:11,453
and your lovely fiancée
is 3,000 miles away

734
00:36:11,587 --> 00:36:13,147
and she won't know shit.

735
00:36:13,284 --> 00:36:14,593
- What do you want me to do?

736
00:36:14,723 --> 00:36:16,610
Grab her by the hair,
drag her behind the dunes,

737
00:36:16,740 --> 00:36:18,812
fuck her brains out,
hope she doesn't say anything to Claire?

738
00:36:18,948 --> 00:36:20,988
Just pretend it doesn't happen?
Is that your game plan?

739
00:36:21,124 --> 00:36:23,677
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Because now you're talking my language.

740
00:36:23,812 --> 00:36:25,787
Now I like the way you're thinking.

741
00:36:25,924 --> 00:36:27,898
Because guess what -
it happens every night,

742
00:36:28,035 --> 00:36:30,588
in every town in every country
across the world.

743
00:36:30,724 --> 00:36:33,374
Men and women hooking up,
doing what comes naturally,

744
00:36:33,508 --> 00:36:34,849
vows be damned.

745
00:36:34,980 --> 00:36:38,079
- I don't wanna talk about this anymore.
Go ahead and enjoy your date

746
00:36:38,212 --> 00:36:40,350
with your married girlfriend, okay?
Enjoy your corrupt existence.

747
00:36:40,484 --> 00:36:43,102
I'm gonna stay here,
I'm gonna watch a little Sports Centre,

748
00:36:43,235 --> 00:36:45,985
and I'm gonna go to bed
with a clean conscience, okay?

749
00:36:46,115 --> 00:36:48,057
- Fine, I'm just trying to help you out.

750
00:36:48,195 --> 00:36:50,433
I'm passing on advice, that's all.
- Thanks a lot.

751
00:36:51,588 --> 00:36:53,344
- Just keep something in mind,
though, okay?

752
00:36:55,108 --> 00:36:56,537
Ain't nobody videotaping ya.

753
00:36:58,148 --> 00:37:00,537
Have a good night.
- Good night, Uncle Terry.

754
00:37:02,788 --> 00:37:04,065
(music)

755
00:37:35,909 --> 00:37:39,521
<i>I've come to terms
with the things that I've learned</i>

756
00:37:39,654 --> 00:37:42,949
<i>About you and your penchant
for being the person</i>

757
00:37:43,077 --> 00:37:45,346
<i>Who goes home alone</i>

758
00:37:45,989 --> 00:37:48,378
<i>And cries</i>

759
00:37:59,429 --> 00:38:01,698
<i>- Hi.
- Hey, Claire, it's me.</i>

760
00:38:01,829 --> 00:38:05,178
- Hey, I'm just having a drink
before my bridal shower. What's up?

761
00:38:08,197 --> 00:38:10,586
Hello? Earth to Johnny. Come in, please.

762
00:38:11,589 --> 00:38:13,977
- I don't think you're gonna like this,
but, uh...

763
00:38:14,789 --> 00:38:17,375
I don't think the job interview
is such a good idea.

764
00:38:17,510 --> 00:38:19,135
<i>- What?!
- Look, I just don't think...</i>

765
00:38:19,269 --> 00:38:22,303
<i>I should have to give up my dream.
- Hold on.</i>

766
00:38:22,438 --> 00:38:24,675
Where's all this coming from
all of a sudden?

767
00:38:24,806 --> 00:38:26,813
- You knew I never thought
it was a good idea to begin with, babe.

768
00:38:26,949 --> 00:38:29,851
- Uh, yeah. But I also know
you made me a promise.

769
00:38:29,990 --> 00:38:32,859
<i>He's pussing out on me.
- I just don't see why</i>

770
00:38:32,998 --> 00:38:35,202
I need to be making $50,000 right now.

771
00:38:35,334 --> 00:38:37,374
Between the two of us,
we're doing okay.

772
00:38:37,509 --> 00:38:39,778
- No, we are not doing okay, Johnny.

773
00:38:39,910 --> 00:38:42,910
My father pays for our rent;
that is not okay.

774
00:38:43,046 --> 00:38:45,151
<i>Besides,
I don't wanna be okay in my life.</i>

775
00:38:45,286 --> 00:38:46,912
- Why are you in such a hurry?

776
00:38:47,046 --> 00:38:49,501
Why do you wanna be
so much like your parents?

777
00:38:49,637 --> 00:38:51,230
- Because my parents
have a wonderful life

778
00:38:51,366 --> 00:38:53,886
with a big apartment
that has plenty of room for children

779
00:38:54,022 --> 00:38:56,608
and that's what I want!
And that's what you told me

780
00:38:56,742 --> 00:38:58,814
<i>you wanted as well.
- I do. I do eventually.</i>

781
00:38:58,950 --> 00:39:02,267
I just don't see why that means
I have to give up my dream.

782
00:39:02,407 --> 00:39:04,033
- Your dream? To be what?

783
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:07,014
- To be a sportscaster, babe,
you know that. And to be honest,

784
00:39:07,143 --> 00:39:10,307
I don't think it's such a long shot.
I'm already on the radio.

785
00:39:10,439 --> 00:39:11,868
- Yeah, barely, Johnny.

786
00:39:12,871 --> 00:39:15,937
<i>Not to mention how embarrassing
this will be for my father.</i>

787
00:39:16,070 --> 00:39:18,656
<i>- He'll get over it.
- Okay, well, you know what?</i>

788
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,376
You are gonna let him know
you're reneging on a promise,

789
00:39:21,511 --> 00:39:24,894
'cause I am not making that phone call.
You are making that phone call!

790
00:39:25,031 --> 00:39:27,452
In fact, no. You know what?
You're gonna do it like a man!

791
00:39:27,590 --> 00:39:29,500
<i>Face to face.
- Look...</i>

792
00:39:30,151 --> 00:39:32,290
... I haven't made my mind up.
Okay?

793
00:39:32,423 --> 00:39:34,332
Nothing's set in stone. I'm just...

794
00:39:34,470 --> 00:39:35,965
thinking out loud.

795
00:39:36,103 --> 00:39:38,372
- Well, you better make up your mind
before tomorrow night.

796
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:42,464
Oh, cool, now I'm late for my party
and I'm in a shitty mood. Thanks a lot!

797
00:39:43,559 --> 00:39:44,704
- Babe.

798
00:40:09,191 --> 00:40:10,206
- Wow.

799
00:40:10,343 --> 00:40:14,118
Okay, please tell me
the coast is clear,

800
00:40:14,248 --> 00:40:16,190
because you look... phenomenal.

801
00:40:17,032 --> 00:40:18,144
- Thanks.

802
00:40:18,631 --> 00:40:20,519
But did you forget something?

803
00:40:22,792 --> 00:40:24,253
- No, I... don't think so.

804
00:40:24,391 --> 00:40:26,781
- You show up to a date empty-handed?

805
00:40:27,272 --> 00:40:29,541
No wine, no flowers, no chocolates.

806
00:40:29,673 --> 00:40:32,291
I mean, Terry, come on,
where's the chivalry?

807
00:40:32,424 --> 00:40:35,042
- I'm kinda shocked that I forgot,

808
00:40:35,177 --> 00:40:37,860
because I have something...
pretty special.

809
00:40:37,992 --> 00:40:39,454
It's just in the car.

810
00:40:39,592 --> 00:40:41,152
Give me one second.
I'll be right back.

811
00:40:45,160 --> 00:40:46,949
- Should I be scared or excited?

812
00:40:47,080 --> 00:40:49,502
- No, I think you're...
really gonna like this. It's...

813
00:40:57,513 --> 00:41:01,157
Granted, it's a little unorthodox, okay?
But I have a friend

814
00:41:01,288 --> 00:41:03,143
who owns this little boutique
downtown,

815
00:41:03,273 --> 00:41:06,688
and he swears to me
this is a pretty hot commodity.

816
00:41:06,824 --> 00:41:09,989
So... take a look,
tell me if you like it.

817
00:41:10,121 --> 00:41:12,292
- Wow! Very impressive.

818
00:41:12,426 --> 00:41:14,498
- A little better
than a bottle of Cabernet, right?

819
00:41:14,633 --> 00:41:16,902
(laughing)
- Yes, a little better!

820
00:41:17,033 --> 00:41:18,626
Please, come in.

821
00:41:19,913 --> 00:41:21,701
<i>Oh my darling
- How are ya?</i>

822
00:41:21,833 --> 00:41:24,037
<i>Love to call you mine</i>

823
00:41:24,169 --> 00:41:25,249
<i>Oh my darling</i>

824
00:41:25,385 --> 00:41:29,957
<i>Now that you've arrived
there's so much I'd like to show you</i>

825
00:41:30,089 --> 00:41:31,616
<i>Gonna know you
- Hey.</i>

826
00:41:31,753 --> 00:41:34,655
<i>For the rest of my life
- Hey. I knew you'd show up.</i>

827
00:41:34,793 --> 00:41:37,182
- How ya doin? Ah...
What's going on?

828
00:41:38,953 --> 00:41:41,506
Friends of yours?
- Ah, they just met.

829
00:41:44,393 --> 00:41:45,822
- So... how you doin'?

830
00:41:46,153 --> 00:41:48,520
- I'm doing great,
but not as well as Maggie over there.

831
00:41:49,673 --> 00:41:53,089
Jesus, Mags, get a room!
- Were you guys watching us?

832
00:41:53,226 --> 00:41:55,233
- Kinda hard not to.

833
00:41:55,370 --> 00:41:58,153
- Sorry. I thought everybody had left.
- No...

834
00:41:58,634 --> 00:42:01,056
Still here. Just watching the show.

835
00:42:01,194 --> 00:42:02,503
(laughter)

836
00:42:02,634 --> 00:42:05,318
Hey, this is my friend Johnny
I was telling you about.

837
00:42:05,450 --> 00:42:06,628
- Hi.
- Hi, Johnny.

838
00:42:06,762 --> 00:42:10,111
You're the DJ, right?
- Uh, yeah. I do like a talk-radio show.

839
00:42:10,250 --> 00:42:12,225
- All right, babe, I'm outta here.
- Oh.

840
00:42:12,362 --> 00:42:15,875
Sorry. I'm gonna go. Are you cool?
- Yeah. I'm with Johnny.

841
00:42:16,010 --> 00:42:18,945
Who is much more well-endowed
than that dude!

842
00:42:19,082 --> 00:42:20,608
- Whip it out right here.
- Yeah!

843
00:42:20,746 --> 00:42:23,112
Come on, bro! Whip it out!

844
00:42:24,202 --> 00:42:25,664
(Brooke laughing)

845
00:42:28,394 --> 00:42:30,979
- So the party kind of broke up
a little early, huh?

846
00:42:31,114 --> 00:42:33,186
- I dunno.
Depends on how you look at it.

847
00:42:33,834 --> 00:42:36,552
Maybe now that you're here,
the party just got started.

848
00:42:37,355 --> 00:42:38,849
Oh, shit!
- You okay?

849
00:42:38,986 --> 00:42:41,158
- Yeah. Maggie!

850
00:42:41,291 --> 00:42:42,785
Hey, Maggie!

851
00:42:45,194 --> 00:42:46,623
You got my keys!

852
00:42:47,755 --> 00:42:49,031
Leave them on the mat.

853
00:42:51,914 --> 00:42:54,151
- Oh, careful.
(Brooke laughing)

854
00:42:58,475 --> 00:43:00,712
That was a close one, huh?
(Brooke laughing)

855
00:43:13,675 --> 00:43:15,268
- Can I tell you something?

856
00:43:16,074 --> 00:43:17,503
- Yeah. What's up?

857
00:43:17,642 --> 00:43:20,229
- It's really more like a confession.

858
00:43:20,875 --> 00:43:22,698
Does that make you nervous?

859
00:43:22,828 --> 00:43:25,697
- Nervous? No. Doesn't make me nervous.
Do I look nervous?

860
00:43:25,835 --> 00:43:27,591
- You kinda look nervous.
- I'm not nervous.

861
00:43:27,724 --> 00:43:30,790
No. There's just some smoke
blowing in my eyes a little bit.

862
00:43:34,956 --> 00:43:36,068
- I...

863
00:43:36,876 --> 00:43:38,469
... have never been in love.

864
00:43:39,915 --> 00:43:41,344
Is that weird?

865
00:43:42,155 --> 00:43:43,748
- No, I don't think that's weird.

866
00:43:44,908 --> 00:43:46,980
- I was close. I was really close.

867
00:43:47,116 --> 00:43:50,018
With that jerk I was telling you about.
- Mm.

868
00:43:50,156 --> 00:43:51,749
- He was so romantic.

869
00:43:52,555 --> 00:43:54,148
Get this. He told me...

870
00:43:54,956 --> 00:43:58,338
... that I was the queen
of all his dreams.

871
00:43:58,475 --> 00:44:00,264
Can you believe I bought that?

872
00:44:00,395 --> 00:44:03,266
- Yeah... and he stole that
from a Led Zeppelin song.

873
00:44:04,717 --> 00:44:05,829
Sorry.

874
00:44:08,397 --> 00:44:09,858
- She really loves you?

875
00:44:09,996 --> 00:44:11,906
- I hope so, we're getting married soon.

876
00:44:15,756 --> 00:44:17,545
- Man, if she really loves you,

877
00:44:17,676 --> 00:44:20,676
why is she making you take
that stupid-ass cardboard job

878
00:44:20,812 --> 00:44:23,300
when even I can tell you don't want it?

879
00:44:23,436 --> 00:44:26,633
- You know, I've been struggling
with that question all weekend.

880
00:44:27,116 --> 00:44:29,189
But you'd be happy to know that...

881
00:44:29,836 --> 00:44:31,745
... I called her and I let her know

882
00:44:31,884 --> 00:44:33,859
that I'm thinking
about not taking the job.

883
00:44:33,996 --> 00:44:37,030
- Hey! Good for you!
- Thank you. Thanks.

884
00:44:46,958 --> 00:44:48,714
No, no, no. No, this is...

885
00:44:49,357 --> 00:44:50,786
This isn't a good idea.

886
00:44:51,917 --> 00:44:54,153
- Yeah, but what if it was just, um...

887
00:44:55,437 --> 00:44:56,899
... a sweet...

888
00:44:57,037 --> 00:44:58,793
little, innocent kiss?

889
00:44:59,917 --> 00:45:01,859
- You're drunk.
- I know.

890
00:45:02,797 --> 00:45:04,553
And I'm stoned, too.

891
00:45:05,037 --> 00:45:06,466
- She's stoned, too.

892
00:45:12,237 --> 00:45:13,546
Mm. Mm-mm.

893
00:45:13,677 --> 00:45:16,066
Mm-mm. No, no, no, no, no, no.

894
00:45:16,205 --> 00:45:18,627
This is bad.
Look, Brooke, I like you.

895
00:45:19,597 --> 00:45:21,867
You're so pretty and I would want
nothing more than to...

896
00:45:21,997 --> 00:45:24,583
kiss you... right now,
but I'm engaged.

897
00:45:24,717 --> 00:45:26,146
I can't do this.

898
00:45:26,477 --> 00:45:28,136
I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go.

899
00:45:28,270 --> 00:45:30,987
- What, and leave me here all alone?

900
00:45:31,118 --> 00:45:32,645
- Where are all your friends?

901
00:45:34,798 --> 00:45:36,227
- Everybody's gone.

902
00:45:37,198 --> 00:45:38,954
Everybody except you.

903
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:44,234
- How are you gonna get home?
- I could sleep on the beach.

904
00:45:44,718 --> 00:45:46,441
Have you ever slept on the beach?

905
00:45:46,574 --> 00:45:48,876
- Not really
a sleep-on-the-beach kinda guy.

906
00:45:51,438 --> 00:45:52,867
- You could be.

907
00:45:53,358 --> 00:45:56,041
- Look, how about I drive you home
in your car, okay?

908
00:45:56,174 --> 00:45:59,655
Then I'd drop you off and return it
in the morning. Is that okay?

909
00:45:59,790 --> 00:46:01,350
- You would do that?

910
00:46:02,030 --> 00:46:03,274
- Yeah, of course.

911
00:46:04,078 --> 00:46:05,419
- Hey, Johnny?

912
00:46:05,837 --> 00:46:06,950
- Yeah?

913
00:46:09,038 --> 00:46:10,631
- You really are a nice guy.

914
00:46:10,991 --> 00:46:13,260
- I try. Let's go.

915
00:46:13,391 --> 00:46:16,074
Come on, huh?
- Hey, I'm cold.

916
00:46:16,879 --> 00:46:17,827
- Here.

917
00:46:25,038 --> 00:46:27,275
Let's go. Let's get you home, huh?

918
00:46:28,239 --> 00:46:29,668
(Brooke giggling)
Careful...

919
00:46:29,807 --> 00:46:32,589
(Johnny laughing)
- Somehow I don't really know.

920
00:46:32,718 --> 00:46:34,693
(clattering)
- No, it's okay, let it go. It's fine.

921
00:46:34,831 --> 00:46:36,587
We're gonna pick it up in a second.

922
00:46:36,719 --> 00:46:39,468
Let's get you to the car, huh?
- All right, that sounds good.

923
00:46:39,598 --> 00:46:40,744
(laughter)

924
00:46:40,879 --> 00:46:43,628
Do you wanna sing a song with me?
- Maybe later, huh?

925
00:46:43,759 --> 00:46:46,476
- Maybe in the car?
- Yeah, yeah. We'll sing one right now.

926
00:46:46,607 --> 00:46:48,909
We'll sing a song. Okay, watch yourself.
- Okay, okay.

927
00:46:49,038 --> 00:46:50,183
- Big step!
- Oh...

928
00:46:50,319 --> 00:46:51,267
- Oh...!

929
00:46:51,759 --> 00:46:53,188
Okay, hang out right here.

930
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,436
There we go.

931
00:46:56,879 --> 00:46:57,992
Okay...

932
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:05,196
Your chariot.
- Who says chivalry is dead?

933
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,553
- Okay, okay... Okay.

934
00:47:09,520 --> 00:47:10,796
(Brooke giggling)

935
00:47:11,600 --> 00:47:13,029
There we go.

936
00:47:13,999 --> 00:47:16,749
One foot... two foot. Perfect.

937
00:47:16,879 --> 00:47:18,919
Be right back.
I'm gonna grab the rest.

938
00:47:19,055 --> 00:47:21,706
- Yeah, I'm just gonna
close my eyes for a second.

939
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,268
- All right, I'll be right back.

940
00:47:28,399 --> 00:47:31,748
Okay... This is everything you had,
right? This is all your stuff?

941
00:47:36,079 --> 00:47:37,028
Brooke.

942
00:47:38,801 --> 00:47:40,077
Hey, Brooke.

943
00:47:41,521 --> 00:47:44,335
Brooke! I don't know where you live!
I don't know where to take you.

944
00:47:47,121 --> 00:47:48,549
(huffing)
Perfect.

945
00:47:56,048 --> 00:47:57,423
Shit.

946
00:48:10,192 --> 00:48:10,737
(soft music)

947
00:48:10,737 --> 00:48:11,435
(soft music)

948
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,214
- Where are we?
- My uncle's place.

949
00:48:14,352 --> 00:48:17,222
You passed out,
so I didn't know where to take you.

950
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:20,557
I can still take you home, though.
- No, no, no, it'll be fine.

951
00:48:28,881 --> 00:48:31,914
- So look...
I'm gonna take you to my room.

952
00:48:32,562 --> 00:48:33,991
Okay, you can stay there?

953
00:48:35,761 --> 00:48:37,354
- Um... okay.

954
00:48:38,001 --> 00:48:39,911
- No, I'll stay on the couch.

955
00:48:40,561 --> 00:48:41,673
- Got it.

956
00:48:42,321 --> 00:48:43,433
- All right.

957
00:49:15,922 --> 00:49:17,351
<i>Why...</i>

958
00:49:18,962 --> 00:49:21,864
<i>Do I apologize</i>

959
00:49:22,002 --> 00:49:25,384
<i>For everything
from what I say to what I sing</i>

960
00:49:25,522 --> 00:49:27,431
<i>And why...
Good night.</i>

961
00:49:29,042 --> 00:49:31,050
<i>Have all my friends</i>

962
00:49:31,186 --> 00:49:32,746
<i>Become my enemies</i>

963
00:49:32,882 --> 00:49:36,111
<i>Do they see some other side of me</i>

964
00:49:36,242 --> 00:49:39,111
<i>Do you say you've got one too</i>

965
00:49:40,082 --> 00:49:42,831
<i>Perhaps I can relate to you</i>

966
00:49:42,962 --> 00:49:46,311
<i>And everything you're going through</i>

967
00:49:56,883 --> 00:49:59,371
- I think you should call him back
and apologize.

968
00:49:59,507 --> 00:50:01,995
- No, I'm not gonna call him back
and apologize.

969
00:50:02,131 --> 00:50:05,709
- Dude, you called him a pussy.
- I did not call him a pussy!

970
00:50:05,842 --> 00:50:08,046
- I was standing right there!
You totally said,

971
00:50:08,179 --> 00:50:10,513
''I knew you would puss out.''
- Oh...

972
00:50:10,642 --> 00:50:13,064
Well, I said that to you, not him.

973
00:50:13,203 --> 00:50:15,920
- I know. Listen,
I think you should call him back,

974
00:50:16,050 --> 00:50:19,018
'cause it's like, what,
3:00 in the morning right now.

975
00:50:19,155 --> 00:50:21,042
So you're gonna
get his voicemail anyhow.

976
00:50:21,171 --> 00:50:23,440
And just leave him
a nice, nice message.

977
00:50:24,563 --> 00:50:25,992
Tell him that you understand

978
00:50:26,131 --> 00:50:29,360
why he's having such a hard time
going on this interview.

979
00:50:29,490 --> 00:50:31,630
That he still has to go anyway,

980
00:50:31,763 --> 00:50:34,000
yadda, yadda, yadda...
I think you should do that.

981
00:50:35,603 --> 00:50:38,320
- All right, fine, I will call him.
But... it really pisses me off

982
00:50:38,452 --> 00:50:40,786
that I'm being made to look
like the bad guy here.

983
00:50:40,915 --> 00:50:42,639
- You're not the bad guy.
- I know.

984
00:50:44,884 --> 00:50:45,996
Ahem.

985
00:51:02,804 --> 00:51:04,080
(cellphone ringing)

986
00:51:05,684 --> 00:51:06,829
- Hello?

987
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,034
- What just happened?

988
00:51:19,764 --> 00:51:21,226
- That sonofabitch!
Some girl just answered!

989
00:51:21,365 --> 00:51:23,088
- Did you dial the right number?
- Yes!

990
00:51:23,221 --> 00:51:26,450
I have it programmed, for chrissake!
- Make sure you called the right person!

991
00:51:26,581 --> 00:51:29,810
- Oh my God, I do not fucking believe
this! If this fucking guy

992
00:51:29,940 --> 00:51:32,908
is fucking around on me,
I swear I'm gonna call Kevin Tyler,

993
00:51:33,045 --> 00:51:35,762
that hot guy from the office,
have him come over here,

994
00:51:35,892 --> 00:51:39,121
clear these bags from this table
and make sweet, vengeful love to him

995
00:51:39,253 --> 00:51:41,642
on top of this thing
Johnny's mom bought me!

996
00:51:41,781 --> 00:51:44,236
Give me one moment.

997
00:51:44,372 --> 00:51:45,681
(cellphone ringing)

998
00:51:48,245 --> 00:51:49,521
(ringing)

999
00:51:52,245 --> 00:51:53,325
- Hello?

1000
00:51:53,461 --> 00:51:57,423
<i>- Who is this, please?
- This is Brooke. Who is this, please?</i>

1001
00:51:57,558 --> 00:52:00,405
- This is Claire Meadows.
Would you mind explaining to me

1002
00:52:00,534 --> 00:52:03,087
how the hell you are answering
this fucking phone

1003
00:52:03,221 --> 00:52:05,043
at 3:00 in the morning?!

1004
00:52:05,174 --> 00:52:07,475
- Wow, lady, chill out.

1005
00:52:07,606 --> 00:52:09,394
You are rude...

1006
00:52:09,526 --> 00:52:10,638
Goodbye.

1007
00:52:14,645 --> 00:52:17,263
- She hung up on me.
She hung up on me, that bitch!

1008
00:52:17,397 --> 00:52:20,561
- What'd she say?
- Nothing. Said I was rude and hung up.

1009
00:52:20,694 --> 00:52:22,516
- You're not rude! You're the nicest!

1010
00:52:22,645 --> 00:52:25,645
- I'm rude? I'm not the one
who's answering someone else's...

1011
00:52:25,781 --> 00:52:28,564
fucking fiancé's phone
in the middle of the night!

1012
00:52:29,845 --> 00:52:31,470
Holy shit...

1013
00:52:31,606 --> 00:52:32,947
I'm gonna cry.

1014
00:52:33,078 --> 00:52:35,925
- No, no, no.
- Holy shit, holy shit, I'm gonna cry!

1015
00:52:36,054 --> 00:52:38,607
- No, no, no, no. No.
Hey, hey, hey. No.

1016
00:52:38,741 --> 00:52:41,076
Pretty, pretty, pretty...
Don't jump to conclusions, okay?

1017
00:52:41,207 --> 00:52:42,668
He's with his uncle, right?

1018
00:52:42,806 --> 00:52:45,523
So that could be some girl
that's hooking up with his uncle.

1019
00:52:46,166 --> 00:52:47,595
- No, that's stupid.

1020
00:52:49,526 --> 00:52:53,268
Fuck it, I'm calling Kevin Tyler.
- No! Just... call that bitch back.

1021
00:52:53,398 --> 00:52:56,878
Tell her she better get
your fucking fiancé on the phone.

1022
00:52:58,487 --> 00:52:59,599
Do that.

1023
00:53:01,718 --> 00:53:04,239
(cellphone ringing)
- What the... fuck?

1024
00:53:05,846 --> 00:53:06,959
(ringing)

1025
00:53:11,126 --> 00:53:13,515
- She's not even picking up.
It's going straight to voicemail.

1026
00:53:14,326 --> 00:53:15,438
Ahem.

1027
00:53:17,206 --> 00:53:19,442
Hi, baby, it's your fiancée!

1028
00:53:20,086 --> 00:53:24,429
So why is it that you didn't wanna
go for that job interview?

1029
00:53:24,567 --> 00:53:28,244
Is it because you're too busy
sticking your little pencil dick

1030
00:53:28,375 --> 00:53:30,350
into some Long Island bitch's ass?!

1031
00:53:30,487 --> 00:53:33,138
Seriously, Johnny,
you better have a good explanation

1032
00:53:33,271 --> 00:53:35,922
for why there's some whore
answering your phone

1033
00:53:36,055 --> 00:53:38,510
at 3:00 in the morning, Johnny!

1034
00:53:38,647 --> 00:53:40,752
Listen, I never wanna see you again!

1035
00:53:40,887 --> 00:53:43,505
You are a piece of shit, Johnny Rizzo,

1036
00:53:43,639 --> 00:53:46,322
and I hope your fucking cock falls off!

1037
00:53:47,607 --> 00:53:51,633
- Okay, so that was a little bit harsher
than I think we intended, but...

1038
00:53:51,767 --> 00:53:53,076
hey...

1039
00:53:53,207 --> 00:53:54,669
hey, it's Johnny.

1040
00:53:54,807 --> 00:53:56,236
He probably just lost his phone.

1041
00:54:04,087 --> 00:54:06,477
- Who the bloody hell is that?

1042
00:54:17,048 --> 00:54:18,324
Excuse me.

1043
00:54:19,287 --> 00:54:20,400
Excuse me!

1044
00:54:21,207 --> 00:54:22,800
Hello? What are you doing here?

1045
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:25,968
What are you doing here?
Open the door.

1046
00:54:26,104 --> 00:54:28,144
- My uncle lives here. Who are you?

1047
00:54:28,280 --> 00:54:31,182
- I am the caretaker of this property
and you're trespassing. Now who are you?

1048
00:54:31,319 --> 00:54:33,207
- I'm not trespassing.
This is my uncle's house.

1049
00:54:33,335 --> 00:54:35,507
- What uncle? I don't know any uncle.

1050
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:38,487
- Terry Cunningham.
- Terry Cunningham

1051
00:54:38,616 --> 00:54:40,917
doesn't own this house!
He's a guest of Mrs. Giordano,

1052
00:54:41,048 --> 00:54:44,081
and he's meant to be out of here
by 8:00 this morning!

1053
00:54:44,216 --> 00:54:45,874
So I want you to pack your bags,

1054
00:54:46,008 --> 00:54:47,699
and get up and go and leave.

1055
00:54:47,832 --> 00:54:49,589
Or otherwise. I'll... I'll call the cops.

1056
00:54:49,721 --> 00:54:52,437
- Wait, what?
This isn't my uncle's house?

1057
00:54:52,569 --> 00:54:55,024
- I'm giving you five minutes.
Five minutes to pack up your shit

1058
00:54:55,161 --> 00:54:57,266
and get out of here.
I mean it, get out!

1059
00:54:57,400 --> 00:54:58,611
Now! Go!

1060
00:54:58,745 --> 00:55:00,272
- Out!
- Okay!

1061
00:55:00,409 --> 00:55:01,619
- Five minutes.

1062
00:55:14,649 --> 00:55:15,663
- Brooke...

1063
00:55:18,329 --> 00:55:19,539
Brooke.

1064
00:55:20,569 --> 00:55:23,602
We gotta get going. I'm sorry.
You gotta get up.

1065
00:55:25,369 --> 00:55:26,645
- Oh, hey.

1066
00:55:28,889 --> 00:55:30,318
Where am I again?

1067
00:55:30,936 --> 00:55:32,824
- I'm not sure, actually,
whose house this is, anymore,

1068
00:55:32,954 --> 00:55:35,736
but this is where I'm staying
and I had to take you here.

1069
00:55:35,866 --> 00:55:38,648
I was gonna drive you home last night.
- You took me home?

1070
00:55:39,610 --> 00:55:41,203
Wait, did anything happen?

1071
00:55:44,729 --> 00:55:46,834
- No. No.
- Oh, good.

1072
00:55:46,969 --> 00:55:47,951
- Yeah.

1073
00:55:48,089 --> 00:55:50,806
- Well, not that that would've been bad,
necessarily...

1074
00:55:50,938 --> 00:55:53,393
- Yeah, you were really drunk last night.
- Yeah, I got pretty wasted.

1075
00:55:53,529 --> 00:55:55,984
- You passed out, actually.
So I didn't know where to take you,

1076
00:55:56,121 --> 00:55:57,877
so I took you here.
Hope it's okay.

1077
00:55:58,010 --> 00:56:01,206
- And nothing happened?
- No, nothing happened.

1078
00:56:01,850 --> 00:56:04,086
- Not even a... kiss?

1079
00:56:05,690 --> 00:56:06,999
- Kiss? Uh...

1080
00:56:07,129 --> 00:56:08,656
there might've been a...

1081
00:56:08,793 --> 00:56:11,160
... a small, innocent kiss of sorts.

1082
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:12,599
No big deal.

1083
00:56:12,729 --> 00:56:15,184
- Oh... the innocent kiss.
- Yeah.

1084
00:56:15,322 --> 00:56:16,849
- I remember that.

1085
00:56:16,986 --> 00:56:18,896
- Look, actually. Can we, um...
can we get going?

1086
00:56:19,035 --> 00:56:21,173
There's a guy downstairs,
he say's he'll call the cops

1087
00:56:21,307 --> 00:56:22,681
if we don't leave.
- The cops?

1088
00:56:22,810 --> 00:56:25,778
Why?
I thought you said nothing happened.

1089
00:56:25,914 --> 00:56:26,929
- Yeah. Nothing did happen.

1090
00:56:27,067 --> 00:56:28,823
But we gotta get going.
I can't find my phone,

1091
00:56:28,954 --> 00:56:31,321
so I can't call my uncle,
so I don't know what's going on.

1092
00:56:31,450 --> 00:56:35,990
- Y'know, I have a vague recollection
of it ringing in the middle of the night

1093
00:56:36,122 --> 00:56:38,293
and me throwing it across the room.

1094
00:56:38,426 --> 00:56:40,314
- That's right, you had my sweatshirt.

1095
00:56:42,746 --> 00:56:45,332
- Is that it over there?
- Let me see.

1096
00:56:47,130 --> 00:56:48,242
Shoot.

1097
00:56:49,210 --> 00:56:50,868
Yeah, okay. Uh...

1098
00:56:51,002 --> 00:56:53,010
my fiancée called.
All right, I'm gonna go downstairs

1099
00:56:53,146 --> 00:56:55,153
and listen to the voicemail.
Can you get ready?

1100
00:56:55,290 --> 00:56:56,916
I'll meet you down there?
- Yeah, okay.

1101
00:56:57,050 --> 00:56:58,644
- All right. Great.
- Hey, um...

1102
00:56:58,779 --> 00:57:01,201
Thanks for... taking care of me.

1103
00:57:02,299 --> 00:57:03,793
- Of course.

1104
00:57:03,931 --> 00:57:05,044
All right.

1105
00:57:08,251 --> 00:57:09,745
(up-tempo music)

1106
00:57:15,867 --> 00:57:19,479
<i>It was a Saturday
spent sitting on the lawn</i>

1107
00:57:19,611 --> 00:57:21,106
<i>The radio was on</i>

1108
00:57:21,691 --> 00:57:24,440
<i>Soundtrack to the time
I spent with you</i>

1109
00:57:24,571 --> 00:57:26,872
<i>So I listened all night long</i>

1110
00:57:28,251 --> 00:57:30,193
<i>Every number put me somewhere</i>

1111
00:57:30,331 --> 00:57:32,600
<i>From 1988 to '91</i>

1112
00:57:32,731 --> 00:57:35,098
<i>We all need the music</i>

1113
00:57:36,667 --> 00:57:39,449
<i>We all love a song</i>

1114
00:57:40,571 --> 00:57:44,533
<i>In our hearts it saves us</i>

1115
00:57:44,668 --> 00:57:46,970
<i>It saves us when we're out of whack</i>

1116
00:57:47,100 --> 00:57:48,311
<i>So ain't it time</i>

1117
00:57:48,444 --> 00:57:50,419
<i>We saved the music back</i>

1118
00:57:58,204 --> 00:57:58,779
You didn't happen to pick up
my cellphone last night?

1119
00:57:58,779 --> 00:58:00,602
You didn't happen to pick up
my cellphone last night?

1120
00:58:00,732 --> 00:58:01,845
- Oh...

1121
00:58:02,492 --> 00:58:03,921
You know, I may have.

1122
00:58:04,252 --> 00:58:06,837
Is that a problem?
- Yeah. Yeah.

1123
00:58:06,972 --> 00:58:10,681
- I kinda remember some lady
screaming at me. What was that?

1124
00:58:10,812 --> 00:58:12,884
- Yeah, that lady was my fiancée.

1125
00:58:13,020 --> 00:58:16,598
She left a pretty nasty voicemail
asking why some girl -

1126
00:58:16,732 --> 00:58:18,870
I'm assuming that's you -
picked up my phone

1127
00:58:19,004 --> 00:58:21,207
at 3:00 in the morning.
- Oh, shit.

1128
00:58:22,171 --> 00:58:24,113
Is it bad?
- Yeah, kinda!

1129
00:58:24,251 --> 00:58:27,155
She said something
about wanting my dick to fall off?

1130
00:58:27,293 --> 00:58:31,286
- Wow, that would not be good.
- No! No! I think she'd do it, too.

1131
00:58:31,420 --> 00:58:34,835
She'd rip it off!
- Tough to roll as a eunuch these days,

1132
00:58:34,973 --> 00:58:36,499
I would think.
- Yeah. Thanks.

1133
00:58:37,053 --> 00:58:38,547
- Do me a favour?
- Yeah.

1134
00:58:38,685 --> 00:58:40,790
- Grab the wheel a second?
- Right now?

1135
00:58:40,924 --> 00:58:43,128
- Yeah, it's cool, just steer.
- All right.

1136
00:58:43,773 --> 00:58:45,202
- Good?
- Yeah, right.

1137
00:58:45,341 --> 00:58:47,796
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, yeah.

1138
00:58:47,933 --> 00:58:49,722
- You doing good.

1139
00:58:49,853 --> 00:58:52,536
Ah, yeah, this is relaxing.
- Oh, that's funny!

1140
00:58:52,669 --> 00:58:54,741
That's funny. All right, here.
(laughter)

1141
00:58:58,333 --> 00:58:59,762
(up-tempo music)

1142
00:59:01,213 --> 00:59:02,806
<i>Gonna save it back</i>

1143
00:59:03,293 --> 00:59:04,919
<i>Ah save it back</i>

1144
00:59:05,053 --> 00:59:06,962
<i>Save the music back</i>

1145
00:59:13,854 --> 00:59:15,163
All set?
- Yeah.

1146
00:59:15,293 --> 00:59:18,108
Wow, you must be hungry.
Is that a whole pie?

1147
00:59:18,238 --> 00:59:20,278
- Yeah, it's for the mother-in-law.

1148
00:59:20,414 --> 00:59:21,690
- Excuse me?

1149
00:59:22,174 --> 00:59:23,635
- It's for the mother-in-law.

1150
00:59:23,773 --> 00:59:25,661
- Sorry, I'm not hearing you.
- That's funny.

1151
00:59:25,789 --> 00:59:28,244
It's for the mother-in-law.
Is that better?

1152
00:59:28,894 --> 00:59:30,322
Got it. Got it.
- Whoa.

1153
00:59:32,894 --> 00:59:35,283
You know you're not married yet.
- Thanks.

1154
00:59:36,990 --> 00:59:38,331
(soft music)

1155
00:59:41,694 --> 00:59:44,411
<i>Don't ask about the other night</i>

1156
00:59:45,053 --> 00:59:47,322
<i>I was drunk and tired</i>

1157
00:59:47,454 --> 00:59:49,559
<i>Just take a minute</i>

1158
00:59:49,693 --> 00:59:51,156
<i>Unwind</i>

1159
00:59:51,295 --> 00:59:53,204
<i>Let the sleeping dog lie</i>

1160
00:59:54,654 --> 00:59:56,083
<i>Lie...</i>

1161
01:00:00,735 --> 01:00:03,669
- Hey, listen,
you should just let me talk to her.

1162
01:00:03,806 --> 01:00:05,562
I'll tell her what really happened.

1163
01:00:05,695 --> 01:00:08,084
I feel bad. I feel a little responsible.

1164
01:00:09,694 --> 01:00:12,377
I'd feel better if I knew everything
was gonna be okay with you two.

1165
01:00:12,511 --> 01:00:15,031
- Well, thank you, but I think

1166
01:00:15,166 --> 01:00:18,614
that is a very, very bad idea.
- Why?

1167
01:00:18,750 --> 01:00:20,757
I'll just tell her
what a gentleman you've been.

1168
01:00:20,894 --> 01:00:23,829
- Yeah, but even if you told her
what happened and she believed you -

1169
01:00:23,966 --> 01:00:26,203
which she won't, by the way -
she's still gonna wonder

1170
01:00:26,334 --> 01:00:28,341
why we're having breakfast
first thing in the morning.

1171
01:00:28,479 --> 01:00:30,682
It... it's not worth it. I can handle it.

1172
01:00:30,814 --> 01:00:32,854
- You can tell her
you made a new friend.

1173
01:00:32,990 --> 01:00:36,733
- I don't think she'd like the idea of me
having a friend that looks like you.

1174
01:00:39,615 --> 01:00:42,844
- Then you better definitely not tell her
what a good time we're having.

1175
01:00:42,975 --> 01:00:46,204
- Good time?
No, there's no time for fun.

1176
01:00:46,335 --> 01:00:49,204
It's only: ''Hurry up, Johnny,
it's time to get a job!

1177
01:00:49,343 --> 01:00:50,904
It's time to make some real money!

1178
01:00:51,039 --> 01:00:53,079
Come on, Johnny,
it's time for a real career!

1179
01:00:53,215 --> 01:00:56,248
Stop being a kid! Grow up!
You're almost 25, for fuck's sake!''

1180
01:01:01,215 --> 01:01:02,230
- Wow.

1181
01:01:03,775 --> 01:01:06,164
Sounds like you really needed
to get that off your chest.

1182
01:01:09,535 --> 01:01:11,924
Dude, you should just call her right now.

1183
01:01:13,535 --> 01:01:15,924
- And say what?
- I don't know, man.

1184
01:01:16,063 --> 01:01:18,169
Just... tell her how you feel.

1185
01:01:18,304 --> 01:01:19,766
- Feel about what?

1186
01:01:26,976 --> 01:01:28,285
(cellphone ringing)

1187
01:01:28,416 --> 01:01:29,877
Is that her?

1188
01:01:30,016 --> 01:01:32,121
I bet you it's her.
That would be so weird.

1189
01:01:32,256 --> 01:01:34,165
- No. No, it's my uncle.

1190
01:01:34,656 --> 01:01:36,085
I'll be right back.

1191
01:01:37,696 --> 01:01:39,769
<i>Hey, Uncle Terry, what's going on?
- I'm at the house,</i>

1192
01:01:39,904 --> 01:01:42,140
just grabbing my shit.
Where are you?

1193
01:01:42,272 --> 01:01:44,410
- I'm at the beach, actually.
With Brooke.

1194
01:01:45,632 --> 01:01:47,290
- Oh, really? Really?

1195
01:01:48,096 --> 01:01:52,057
So I guess our little talk last night
did you some good after all. Huh?

1196
01:01:52,192 --> 01:01:54,647
Was it as mind-blowing
as you imagined?

1197
01:01:54,784 --> 01:01:57,468
- No, it's not like that.
She had too much to drink last night,

1198
01:01:57,600 --> 01:02:00,055
so I took her back to your place.
Which, by the way,

1199
01:02:00,192 --> 01:02:02,135
I found out isn't actually your place,
is it?

1200
01:02:02,272 --> 01:02:04,378
<i>- Really? What makes you say that?
- Some English guy came,</i>

1201
01:02:04,513 --> 01:02:08,058
woke us up, said if we weren't out
by 8:00, he'd call the cops.

1202
01:02:08,193 --> 01:02:10,135
<i>So what's the deal?
Is it your place or not?</i>

1203
01:02:10,273 --> 01:02:12,477
- Did I actually ever say that?
I don't think I did.

1204
01:02:12,609 --> 01:02:14,813
<i>- Yeah, you said,
''Mi casa es su casa.''</i>

1205
01:02:14,945 --> 01:02:17,312
- Seriously, how the hell
could I afford a house this nice?

1206
01:02:17,441 --> 01:02:20,539
Look, I will pick you up
in the parking lot in about 10 minutes.

1207
01:02:20,673 --> 01:02:22,811
- All right, cool. I'll see you in a bit.

1208
01:02:25,056 --> 01:02:26,485
- Everything okay?
- Yeah, everything's fine.

1209
01:02:26,624 --> 01:02:29,559
My Uncle Terry's gonna pick me up
in a bit.

1210
01:02:29,697 --> 01:02:30,974
- Oh, really?

1211
01:02:31,936 --> 01:02:33,365
So this is it?

1212
01:02:34,497 --> 01:02:35,959
This is the...

1213
01:02:36,097 --> 01:02:38,006
end of our summer fling?

1214
01:02:39,137 --> 01:02:40,413
- Guess so.

1215
01:02:41,729 --> 01:02:43,999
(music)
- You wanna go swimming?

1216
01:02:46,498 --> 01:02:50,010
- Looks kinda rough, don't you think?
I'm not the strongest swimmer.

1217
01:02:50,498 --> 01:02:53,531
- Come on, you got to dive in
at least once before you go.

1218
01:02:53,665 --> 01:02:55,607
- It's gonna be cold! No!

1219
01:02:56,258 --> 01:02:58,592
- It'll be good for my hangover!

1220
01:03:00,897 --> 01:03:03,450
- If it'll be good for your hangover,
all right.

1221
01:03:07,394 --> 01:03:09,020
(up-tempo music)

1222
01:03:13,377 --> 01:03:14,621
- Wow.

1223
01:03:14,754 --> 01:03:17,885
Those waves look a little bigger...
bigger than I thought!

1224
01:03:18,017 --> 01:03:20,603
- I told you. I said they looked rough.

1225
01:03:20,737 --> 01:03:23,039
- All right, are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

1226
01:03:23,169 --> 01:03:25,209
Depends on what you're thinking.
(Brooke laughing)

1227
01:03:26,178 --> 01:03:28,121
- I'm thinking maybe, um...

1228
01:03:28,259 --> 01:03:29,720
let's go back.
- Yeah.

1229
01:03:29,858 --> 01:03:31,287
- Okay.
- Yeah, okay.

1230
01:03:37,699 --> 01:03:39,160
So, uh...

1231
01:03:39,298 --> 01:03:41,535
you know what you're gonna do
after the summer?

1232
01:03:42,499 --> 01:03:44,637
- I hadn't really thought that far ahead.

1233
01:03:44,771 --> 01:03:47,618
You got any ideas?
- Uh, you can go pro?

1234
01:03:49,058 --> 01:03:50,782
- Oh, I think that dream is dead.

1235
01:03:50,914 --> 01:03:53,881
But you know
what I always wanted to do?

1236
01:03:54,019 --> 01:03:56,058
- What's that?
- Cross-country road trip.

1237
01:03:56,195 --> 01:03:59,424
Maybe... find my way out to Oakland.

1238
01:04:03,779 --> 01:04:07,128
You should give me your phone
and let me put my number in it.

1239
01:04:07,267 --> 01:04:09,885
That way, just in case
you don't take this new job,

1240
01:04:10,018 --> 01:04:13,696
and you go back to your radio gig
and you still want to interview me,

1241
01:04:13,827 --> 01:04:15,322
you'll know how to get in touch.

1242
01:04:15,459 --> 01:04:16,571
- Yeah...

1243
01:04:18,180 --> 01:04:19,609
I don't think so, Brooke.

1244
01:04:19,939 --> 01:04:22,012
Yeah, I had fun this weekend.
I did, really.

1245
01:04:22,147 --> 01:04:24,765
I just...
don't think that's such a good idea.

1246
01:04:24,900 --> 01:04:26,842
You know, I feel like it's...

1247
01:04:26,979 --> 01:04:28,255
a little...

1248
01:04:30,019 --> 01:04:32,321
- Inappropriate?
- Yes.

1249
01:04:32,451 --> 01:04:34,044
Inappropriate.
- Yeah.

1250
01:04:34,179 --> 01:04:36,416
You know, I just don't think
Claire would understand.

1251
01:04:36,547 --> 01:04:37,856
Especially what happened this weekend.

1252
01:04:39,939 --> 01:04:41,663
- You're gonna take that job,
aren't you?

1253
01:04:41,795 --> 01:04:44,577
- Pretty much have to.
I gave so many people my word.

1254
01:04:46,179 --> 01:04:47,455
I dunno.

1255
01:04:51,875 --> 01:04:53,371
(horn honking)

1256
01:04:53,508 --> 01:04:55,929
- Yo, lovers! How are you?

1257
01:04:56,068 --> 01:04:57,410
(forced laughter)

1258
01:04:57,540 --> 01:04:59,231
- Hey, Terry. How's Amy doing?

1259
01:05:00,420 --> 01:05:02,559
- What can I say.
She's sleeping like a baby.

1260
01:05:04,580 --> 01:05:06,173
- So I guess this is it, huh?

1261
01:05:06,820 --> 01:05:08,446
- Hey, um...

1262
01:05:08,580 --> 01:05:11,133
thanks again
for being so sweet to me last night.

1263
01:05:11,268 --> 01:05:13,057
- Yeah.
- I had a really great time

1264
01:05:13,188 --> 01:05:14,814
getting to know you.
- Me too.

1265
01:05:16,740 --> 01:05:17,853
Okay...

1266
01:05:25,380 --> 01:05:26,493
- Hey!

1267
01:05:27,780 --> 01:05:30,169
You forgot your mother-in-law's pie!

1268
01:05:32,580 --> 01:05:33,856
- Thanks.

1269
01:05:51,941 --> 01:05:54,974
- Now don't try and tell me
there's nothing going on between you two,

1270
01:05:55,109 --> 01:05:56,734
because love is obviously in the air.

1271
01:05:56,868 --> 01:06:00,381
So let's just hold up here a second
and let me ask you a question.

1272
01:06:00,517 --> 01:06:02,273
Are you sure you don't wanna stay

1273
01:06:02,405 --> 01:06:04,260
and take the train home tonight?
I won't be offended.

1274
01:06:04,389 --> 01:06:06,658
- No, I'm fine. Nothing happened.
It's not what you think.

1275
01:06:06,789 --> 01:06:08,861
- Of course, you're the type that
won't kiss and tell. I understand.

1276
01:06:08,996 --> 01:06:11,298
I forgot who I was dealing with.
Now let me smell your finger.

1277
01:06:11,429 --> 01:06:14,014
- That's gross. Can we go?
I wanna go, please.

1278
01:06:15,268 --> 01:06:16,763
- Are you absolutely sure?

1279
01:06:16,901 --> 01:06:19,619
Because even I can tell
that she's in love with you, man.

1280
01:06:20,742 --> 01:06:23,360
She's gonna be the one that got away,
the great missed opportunity

1281
01:06:23,494 --> 01:06:25,665
that's gonna haunt you
for the rest of your life.

1282
01:06:25,798 --> 01:06:28,732
You're gonna be standing on the altar,
about to say ''I do,''

1283
01:06:28,870 --> 01:06:31,619
and the last image
that flashes before your eyes...

1284
01:06:32,262 --> 01:06:34,979
... is gonna be that fucking beauty
on that blue convertible.

1285
01:06:37,541 --> 01:06:40,575
All right, now if you don't think
that is the case...

1286
01:06:41,222 --> 01:06:44,091
... let me know and I will pull out
of this parking lot right now.

1287
01:06:44,742 --> 01:06:48,124
But if you have any doubts at all,

1288
01:06:48,261 --> 01:06:51,938
open that fucking door right now
and run back to her.

1289
01:06:57,061 --> 01:06:58,817
- Can we go home... please?

1290
01:07:01,222 --> 01:07:02,498
- All right, kid.

1291
01:07:05,671 --> 01:07:06,783
Wow!

1292
01:07:16,614 --> 01:07:18,175
(down-tempo music)

1293
01:07:31,943 --> 01:07:34,310
- Look, do you mind
if we pull over for a second?

1294
01:07:34,438 --> 01:07:37,700
- What you gotta do? Take a leak?
- No, I'd like to make a phone call.

1295
01:07:37,830 --> 01:07:39,772
And I want a little privacy,
if that's okay.

1296
01:07:39,910 --> 01:07:41,536
- You gotta call the fiancée, huh?
(laughing)

1297
01:07:41,862 --> 01:07:45,157
The guilt is getting to you already?
- Yes. If you must know, it is.

1298
01:07:45,702 --> 01:07:48,256
- I knew it. I knew it.
I knew you'd tap that ass!

1299
01:07:48,391 --> 01:07:51,009
- No, I didn't tap anything. Okay?
That's not what this is about.

1300
01:07:51,144 --> 01:07:54,177
- All right. All right.
You're not the type that tells.

1301
01:07:56,743 --> 01:07:59,329
Young blood, admit to nothing, okay?

1302
01:07:59,463 --> 01:08:01,252
You're gonna go to the grave with this.

1303
01:08:01,383 --> 01:08:03,390
I know you think it's gonna help
by confessing -

1304
01:08:03,528 --> 01:08:05,415
that knot in your stomach -
but it won't.

1305
01:08:05,543 --> 01:08:07,453
- Shut up. It's ringing. It's ringing.

1306
01:08:11,943 --> 01:08:13,601
- Good morning, asshole.

1307
01:08:13,736 --> 01:08:15,710
<i>- Claire, I can explain.
- Absolutely not.</i>

1308
01:08:15,847 --> 01:08:17,920
No, I'm not gonna let you explain.

1309
01:08:18,055 --> 01:08:19,484
<i>- No, baby. Baby!
- Fuck youI</i>

1310
01:08:19,623 --> 01:08:21,794
I've done nothing
but good things for you,

1311
01:08:21,928 --> 01:08:24,349
and you've... you've taken
my kindness and my charity,

1312
01:08:24,487 --> 01:08:26,909
and my family's charity
and spit in our face.

1313
01:08:27,047 --> 01:08:30,179
So you can go...
you can go fuck yourself, Johnny Rizzo.

1314
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:32,418
- Shit.

1315
01:08:39,144 --> 01:08:40,573
- That was fast.

1316
01:08:40,904 --> 01:08:42,562
Where did you get this pie?
It's phenomenal.

1317
01:08:42,697 --> 01:08:44,868
- No, Uncle Terry,
that was for my mother-in-law.

1318
01:08:46,984 --> 01:08:48,391
- Oh, shit. I didn't know. I mean...

1319
01:08:48,520 --> 01:08:50,407
I just ate a little bit of the crust.

1320
01:08:50,536 --> 01:08:53,219
- How am I supposed to give her a pie
without a crust, man?!

1321
01:08:53,864 --> 01:08:56,133
- Sorry, you didn't say anything.
What the fuck? I mean...

1322
01:08:56,264 --> 01:08:58,020
- Where's the purse I bought for Claire?

1323
01:08:58,984 --> 01:09:01,056
- Why you asking me?
- I left it in the backseat.

1324
01:09:01,864 --> 01:09:04,253
Do you see it?
- You left it in the car

1325
01:09:04,392 --> 01:09:06,301
with the doors unlocked
and the windows open?

1326
01:09:06,440 --> 01:09:09,310
I mean, it's the Hamptons,
but come on. You can't do that.

1327
01:09:09,448 --> 01:09:11,357
It's fucking stupid.
- Fuck, she's gonna kill me!

1328
01:09:11,496 --> 01:09:13,058
She's gonna fucking kill me!
Goddammit!!

1329
01:09:13,865 --> 01:09:15,327
- You know what?

1330
01:09:15,465 --> 01:09:18,215
You could maybe...
maybe use this as an opportunity

1331
01:09:18,345 --> 01:09:22,338
to finally stand up for yourself.
You could tell her, ''Hey, look, babe,

1332
01:09:22,473 --> 01:09:24,993
I just didn't have time--''
- Shut up!

1333
01:09:25,129 --> 01:09:27,999
Shut the fuck up!
You are a scumbag!

1334
01:09:28,137 --> 01:09:31,006
My life was fine until you made me
come out here this weekend!

1335
01:09:31,145 --> 01:09:33,382
I'm sick of your shit!
Take me home!

1336
01:09:34,345 --> 01:09:37,214
- Look, I'll put the fucking crust back,
all right?

1337
01:09:38,825 --> 01:09:40,930
Here, look. I'm putting it back.

1338
01:09:41,065 --> 01:09:42,853
- Do me a favour--
- She'll never know the difference.

1339
01:09:42,985 --> 01:09:45,057
- Can we not talk
for the rest of the ride?

1340
01:09:48,521 --> 01:09:49,536
- Fine.

1341
01:09:50,825 --> 01:09:52,254
(soft music)

1342
01:10:09,546 --> 01:10:12,296
Here we are.
- I'm sorry I called you a scumbag.

1343
01:10:12,426 --> 01:10:13,855
All right? I didn't mean it.

1344
01:10:14,986 --> 01:10:16,360
- Do me a favour?

1345
01:10:16,490 --> 01:10:18,661
Stop apologizing, man, all right?

1346
01:10:18,986 --> 01:10:20,447
Look, by most people's definition,

1347
01:10:20,586 --> 01:10:23,236
I am a little bit of a scumbag.
And you know what?

1348
01:10:23,370 --> 01:10:25,857
I'm okay with it.
- You're okay with being a scumbag?

1349
01:10:25,994 --> 01:10:27,303
That doesn't make any sense.

1350
01:10:27,786 --> 01:10:32,488
- Well, on the relative scale of things,
I'm a pretty happy guy. Okay?

1351
01:10:32,618 --> 01:10:34,854
So no apology necessary.
- All right.

1352
01:10:34,986 --> 01:10:38,084
- However, if I can, I'd like to give you
one last little bit of advice?

1353
01:10:38,217 --> 01:10:39,625
- More advice?
You're gonna give me more advice?

1354
01:10:39,755 --> 01:10:40,737
Okay, let's hear it.

1355
01:10:40,875 --> 01:10:44,104
- Stop being such a nice guy, all right?

1356
01:10:44,586 --> 01:10:46,375
You know what they say
about nice guys.

1357
01:10:46,506 --> 01:10:47,881
- They finish last?
- I'm not talking

1358
01:10:48,010 --> 01:10:49,766
about running around chasing girls,
getting laid.

1359
01:10:49,899 --> 01:10:52,419
I know that's not your thing,
you're not that guy.

1360
01:10:52,554 --> 01:10:53,798
You made that abundantly clear.

1361
01:10:53,930 --> 01:10:56,199
But stop worrying
about how everybody else feels, man.

1362
01:10:56,331 --> 01:10:59,014
You gotta start worrying about you.
What makes Johnny happy.

1363
01:11:00,746 --> 01:11:03,267
Okay? Because you're not doing
anybody any favours

1364
01:11:03,403 --> 01:11:05,290
if you're unhappy
and you're dissatisfied.

1365
01:11:05,419 --> 01:11:08,069
I think you know
what I'm talking about.

1366
01:11:10,186 --> 01:11:12,357
- Okay. All right. I'll try.

1367
01:11:12,491 --> 01:11:13,538
- Cool.

1368
01:11:14,986 --> 01:11:17,058
Now do me a favor
and get the hell outta here.

1369
01:11:17,195 --> 01:11:18,689
I gotta get this truck back to Jersey

1370
01:11:18,826 --> 01:11:20,582
before her husband gets home
from his golf weekend.

1371
01:11:21,867 --> 01:11:24,682
I live a charmed life, my friend.
- That you do.

1372
01:11:28,683 --> 01:11:29,893
(sighing)

1373
01:11:38,027 --> 01:11:39,969
Hey, Claire, it's me.

1374
01:11:40,107 --> 01:11:43,555
Look, please give me a call back. Okay?
I'm gonna head out to your parents,

1375
01:11:43,691 --> 01:11:46,058
I'd really like to know
what I'm getting myself into.

1376
01:11:46,187 --> 01:11:47,943
Um... I'm wearing the suit!

1377
01:11:48,747 --> 01:11:51,562
Uh, look, if you get this
in the next 10 minutes,

1378
01:11:51,691 --> 01:11:53,252
please give me a call. Okay?

1379
01:11:53,387 --> 01:11:54,499
Um...

1380
01:11:55,148 --> 01:11:56,577
... I love you?

1381
01:12:22,700 --> 01:12:24,293
Baby, it's me again.

1382
01:12:24,428 --> 01:12:27,014
Okay, first of all,
I didn't do anything with that girl.

1383
01:12:27,148 --> 01:12:29,963
Okay? I'm at your dad's house,
we're gonna talk about the interview.

1384
01:12:30,092 --> 01:12:32,743
I'm wearing my suit!
What else can I do for you?

1385
01:12:33,868 --> 01:12:35,624
All right, I'll call you when I'm done.

1386
01:12:40,108 --> 01:12:42,050
- Huh. Sonny!
- Hi, sir.

1387
01:12:42,188 --> 01:12:45,537
- You have managed to get all
of the women in my life really upset.

1388
01:12:46,028 --> 01:12:48,266
My wife is so pissed off at you,
she left the apartment.

1389
01:12:48,397 --> 01:12:50,819
She doesn't even wanna see your face.
- It's been a big misunderstanding, sir.

1390
01:12:50,957 --> 01:12:53,096
I've tried to contact Claire,
she isn't picking up her phone.

1391
01:12:53,229 --> 01:12:54,505
- You blame her?

1392
01:12:55,149 --> 01:12:57,385
Come on, have a seat. Talk to me.

1393
01:12:57,709 --> 01:13:00,775
- Sir, it's not what you think.
It's actually... kind of a funny story.

1394
01:13:00,909 --> 01:13:04,008
I was helping this girl
and I left my phone in my pocket--

1395
01:13:04,141 --> 01:13:06,181
<i>- You don't have
to explain yourself to me.</i>

1396
01:13:06,669 --> 01:13:09,418
I was young once, too,
and I know what you're going through.

1397
01:13:09,549 --> 01:13:10,978
Getting married is terrifying.

1398
01:13:11,469 --> 01:13:14,982
And with good reason.
Marriage is... hard.

1399
01:13:16,397 --> 01:13:18,601
- Sir, I didn't do anything.
I was just helping this girl

1400
01:13:18,733 --> 01:13:21,416
and I left my phone in my pocket.
I gave it to her--

1401
01:13:21,549 --> 01:13:23,142
- I. Don't. Care.

1402
01:13:23,853 --> 01:13:26,820
But what I would like to talk to you
about is this job interview.

1403
01:13:26,957 --> 01:13:29,575
Claire tells me that you're having
second thoughts about that as well.

1404
01:13:29,709 --> 01:13:32,743
- Sir, I love my job. It's the only thing
I ever wanted to do.

1405
01:13:32,877 --> 01:13:34,666
To be honest, I'm really good at it.

1406
01:13:35,630 --> 01:13:38,412
- Tell me something.
How much do you make at that station?

1407
01:13:38,542 --> 01:13:41,803
- Well, right now, not a lot.
But I've been on air for four years,

1408
01:13:41,934 --> 01:13:44,934
I got a nice fan base.
I don't know, maybe one day, it'll--

1409
01:13:45,070 --> 01:13:46,924
- You don't make shit!
- I don't make shit.

1410
01:13:47,054 --> 01:13:48,777
- And you and I both know that.

1411
01:13:48,910 --> 01:13:50,764
And you know
I'm supporting you and Claire.

1412
01:13:50,894 --> 01:13:52,781
- Well, sir,
I don't think that's entirely true.

1413
01:13:52,910 --> 01:13:53,990
- Oh, really?

1414
01:13:54,126 --> 01:13:55,817
Really? It isn't?

1415
01:13:55,950 --> 01:13:59,179
Do you pay the 2,000-a-month rent
for that house, or do I?

1416
01:13:59,309 --> 01:14:01,098
I mean, you know that, right?

1417
01:14:01,229 --> 01:14:03,368
You know that I pay your rent.

1418
01:14:03,501 --> 01:14:07,593
You are included in these monthly
conversations about bills.

1419
01:14:07,726 --> 01:14:09,635
It's not just Claire sitting there
with a calculator

1420
01:14:09,774 --> 01:14:11,977
and a chequebook every month.
- No, of course not, sir.

1421
01:14:12,110 --> 01:14:15,177
And I told Claire I think we don't need
to live in such a nice place.

1422
01:14:15,311 --> 01:14:17,286
We could eat out less
and maybe take the bus.

1423
01:14:17,423 --> 01:14:19,146
- And how about Claire's car?

1424
01:14:20,270 --> 01:14:21,699
And her car insurance?

1425
01:14:22,671 --> 01:14:24,809
And that trip you two took
to Cabo last year?

1426
01:14:24,943 --> 01:14:27,626
- I understand, Mr. Meadows,
but I never really wanted to go to Cabo--

1427
01:14:27,758 --> 01:14:30,214
- Dr. Meadows.
- Dr.--

1428
01:14:30,351 --> 01:14:33,580
- If you don't mind. I busted my ass,
got through medical school.

1429
01:14:33,710 --> 01:14:36,525
I think I've earned the right
to be called Doctor. Yeah.

1430
01:14:36,654 --> 01:14:37,734
- Of course.
- Okay.

1431
01:14:37,870 --> 01:14:40,740
- Dr. Meadows, try to see
where I'm coming from here.

1432
01:14:40,879 --> 01:14:43,530
This is my dream.
I went to journalism school.

1433
01:14:43,663 --> 01:14:46,281
This is what I wanna do
and I don't wanna give it up.

1434
01:14:46,415 --> 01:14:49,033
And I don't think I have to.
Claire and I are still young.

1435
01:14:49,167 --> 01:14:51,174
We don't have to live
in such a nice place.

1436
01:14:51,310 --> 01:14:53,482
We can cut down on our expenses,
be happy with...

1437
01:14:53,615 --> 01:14:55,022
with less.

1438
01:14:55,150 --> 01:14:58,348
- You obviously don't know Claire
very well, do you?

1439
01:15:00,112 --> 01:15:02,533
Tell me something.
What does your...

1440
01:15:02,671 --> 01:15:06,381
dream... pay for,
while I'm paying for everything else?

1441
01:15:08,751 --> 01:15:10,180
- It makes me happy.

1442
01:15:12,304 --> 01:15:13,711
- It makes you happy.

1443
01:15:14,031 --> 01:15:17,195
You have got one swinging pair of balls
on you, kid.

1444
01:15:18,031 --> 01:15:19,558
- Look, Mr. ... Dr. Meadows,

1445
01:15:19,695 --> 01:15:22,826
I understand
what kind of opportunity this is.

1446
01:15:22,960 --> 01:15:25,381
I do. And I appreciate it.

1447
01:15:26,031 --> 01:15:28,453
So I guess I am willing to sit down

1448
01:15:28,591 --> 01:15:30,501
with your friend tomorrow
and discuss it?

1449
01:15:30,640 --> 01:15:33,901
If that's okay?
- You're willing to sit down

1450
01:15:34,032 --> 01:15:35,493
and discuss it?

1451
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:37,420
How very white of you.

1452
01:15:37,551 --> 01:15:39,820
You gotta be out of your fucking mind!

1453
01:15:39,951 --> 01:15:41,545
I cancelled the interview.

1454
01:15:42,513 --> 01:15:44,934
This is a very important man
with a business to run.

1455
01:15:45,072 --> 01:15:48,106
I can't risk wasting his time
with your wishy-washy attitude.

1456
01:15:49,232 --> 01:15:52,581
My advice to you
is to get on a plane back to Claire,

1457
01:15:52,721 --> 01:15:54,826
and see if you can salvage
your relationship.

1458
01:15:55,632 --> 01:15:57,869
Now you know your way out.
Good night.

1459
01:16:08,752 --> 01:16:09,897
- Jimmy.

1460
01:16:10,032 --> 01:16:11,494
Hey, man, it's me.

1461
01:16:11,632 --> 01:16:14,021
Please tell me you didn't give away
my time slot yet.

1462
01:16:14,672 --> 01:16:16,777
You didn't. That's perfect. Don't.

1463
01:16:16,912 --> 01:16:18,668
I'm not taking the job in New York.

1464
01:16:19,153 --> 01:16:21,541
That's great.
I'll tell you when I see you, all right?

1465
01:16:21,872 --> 01:16:23,465
All right, man. Bye.

1466
01:16:26,833 --> 01:16:28,262
(mid-tempo music)

1467
01:17:05,233 --> 01:17:06,182
- Claire?

1468
01:17:09,394 --> 01:17:10,823
Baby, you home?

1469
01:17:11,153 --> 01:17:12,582
- Yeah, I'm in here.

1470
01:17:18,514 --> 01:17:19,791
Hey, baby.

1471
01:17:20,274 --> 01:17:22,991
Do me a favour, come sit down.
- Yeah.

1472
01:17:23,633 --> 01:17:25,389
- We need to talk.
- Yeah.

1473
01:17:28,914 --> 01:17:32,110
Um... you know
nothing happened, right?

1474
01:17:33,074 --> 01:17:35,147
- Yeah, I know. I know.
- Okay.

1475
01:17:35,954 --> 01:17:38,059
- And... I apologize

1476
01:17:38,194 --> 01:17:40,430
for not taking
any of your phone calls...

1477
01:17:40,754 --> 01:17:42,859
... but I was understandably upset.

1478
01:17:42,994 --> 01:17:45,263
- Right. But you know I didn't cheat.

1479
01:17:45,394 --> 01:17:47,980
All right, I'm not that guy.
I'm not wired that way.

1480
01:17:48,114 --> 01:17:50,023
- Yeah, I know. I know.
- Okay.

1481
01:17:50,835 --> 01:17:54,348
- I guess I have to take
some responsibility, because...

1482
01:17:54,835 --> 01:17:57,224
... I should never have let you go
to New York alone.

1483
01:17:58,194 --> 01:17:59,656
We hatched this plan together,

1484
01:17:59,795 --> 01:18:01,867
and I should've been there
to support you.

1485
01:18:03,635 --> 01:18:05,577
Okay, but I have some good news.

1486
01:18:05,715 --> 01:18:08,912
Um... I've already talked to my father...

1487
01:18:09,714 --> 01:18:11,503
... and he's not mad anymore.

1488
01:18:11,955 --> 01:18:14,824
At least he's not as furious
and he's still willing to help.

1489
01:18:16,115 --> 01:18:18,635
- No, baby. I don't want his help, okay?

1490
01:18:18,770 --> 01:18:22,283
I think he's helped us enough.
He made that painfully clear.

1491
01:18:23,154 --> 01:18:25,391
- Okay, well, you need his help.

1492
01:18:25,875 --> 01:18:27,730
And he's willing
to reschedule the interview.

1493
01:18:27,858 --> 01:18:29,484
- I don't wanna do the interview.

1494
01:18:29,619 --> 01:18:31,823
Babe, can't you see
where I'm coming from?

1495
01:18:31,954 --> 01:18:35,665
I like my job. It's who I am.
It's what makes me happy.

1496
01:18:35,795 --> 01:18:39,057
And I get it.
I get where you're coming from, okay?

1497
01:18:39,187 --> 01:18:41,424
And some things in a marriage
you need to compromise,

1498
01:18:41,555 --> 01:18:44,305
but some things can't be compromised,
some things need to be supported.

1499
01:18:44,435 --> 01:18:46,508
- Like what?
- Like my dreams! I dunno.

1500
01:18:46,644 --> 01:18:48,302
I dunno.

1501
01:18:48,435 --> 01:18:49,712
But, baby...

1502
01:18:50,836 --> 01:18:52,297
Nothing would make me happier

1503
01:18:52,436 --> 01:18:54,672
that for you to support my dream
right now.

1504
01:18:58,835 --> 01:19:00,144
- Johnny...

1505
01:19:00,276 --> 01:19:02,185
what about my dreams?

1506
01:19:04,276 --> 01:19:05,737
I'm at a point in my life

1507
01:19:05,875 --> 01:19:08,264
where I have to go after what I want.

1508
01:19:08,755 --> 01:19:10,381
I'm 24 years old!

1509
01:19:10,515 --> 01:19:14,225
I'm not gonna wait till I'm 30
to live the life I wanna live.

1510
01:19:14,355 --> 01:19:18,285
I'm not going to gamble my happiness
on some off-chance

1511
01:19:18,421 --> 01:19:21,355
that you might be successful
as a sportscaster.

1512
01:19:21,876 --> 01:19:23,502
- What do you mean,
you're not gonna wait?

1513
01:19:23,636 --> 01:19:24,748
What does that mean?

1514
01:19:26,357 --> 01:19:27,950
Are you saying the wedding's off?

1515
01:19:28,756 --> 01:19:29,684
- No...

1516
01:19:30,997 --> 01:19:35,153
Not as long as you keep a promise
that you made to me.

1517
01:19:35,284 --> 01:19:38,513
Which means going to New York
and taking that job.

1518
01:19:41,236 --> 01:19:43,625
- Baby, you're gonna think
I'm being selfish...

1519
01:19:44,436 --> 01:19:46,029
... and maybe I am, but...

1520
01:19:46,836 --> 01:19:48,745
... I gotta do what makes me happy.

1521
01:19:49,716 --> 01:19:51,309
I'm not leaving my job.

1522
01:19:59,476 --> 01:20:00,754
- Okay...

1523
01:20:04,597 --> 01:20:06,986
Then I guess... we're through.

1524
01:20:16,597 --> 01:20:18,222
Oh, uh, you didn't...

1525
01:20:18,357 --> 01:20:19,950
pick up my bag, did you?

1526
01:20:20,917 --> 01:20:22,194
- Actually, it...

1527
01:20:23,317 --> 01:20:24,746
... must've slipped my mind.

1528
01:20:26,677 --> 01:20:27,790
- Figures.

1529
01:20:30,421 --> 01:20:30,965
(music)

1530
01:20:30,965 --> 01:20:31,794
(music)

1531
01:20:33,877 --> 01:20:35,568
- It's a lost art,
the artist stealing home,

1532
01:20:35,701 --> 01:20:38,254
and I'm not talking about
the back end of a double steal,

1533
01:20:38,389 --> 01:20:40,145
I am not talking
about the suicide squeeze.

1534
01:20:40,277 --> 01:20:44,021
I am talking about a pure steal of home.
Never happens anymore.

1535
01:20:44,150 --> 01:20:46,059
Now some say it's because pitchers

1536
01:20:46,198 --> 01:20:47,659
don't have a long windup anymore,

1537
01:20:47,798 --> 01:20:49,871
even when there's someone on third.
I don't buy it.

1538
01:20:50,006 --> 01:20:53,072
I think... the reason is fear.

1539
01:20:53,878 --> 01:20:56,780
I think base runners today
have a fear of confrontation,

1540
01:20:56,918 --> 01:20:59,885
a fear of confrontation at home plate.
Think about it.

1541
01:21:00,022 --> 01:21:02,640
They fear the batter
is gonna miss the signal

1542
01:21:02,774 --> 01:21:05,108
and swing away
right as they cross home.

1543
01:21:05,238 --> 01:21:07,955
They fear the baseball,
travelling 100 miles an hour

1544
01:21:08,086 --> 01:21:09,612
has the same destination as their face.

1545
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:11,724
They fear a collision
with the catcher at home.

1546
01:21:11,862 --> 01:21:13,837
All these things can happen
when you steal home,

1547
01:21:13,974 --> 01:21:15,632
which is why it's a lost art.

1548
01:21:15,766 --> 01:21:19,694
But I think it's time for players
to start playing a little more reckless.

1549
01:21:19,830 --> 01:21:23,213
I think it's time for them
to face their fear of confrontation

1550
01:21:23,350 --> 01:21:26,733
and go for it, steal home,
take the chance, inspire the team,

1551
01:21:26,871 --> 01:21:28,944
because sometimes,
when you go for it,

1552
01:21:29,079 --> 01:21:30,901
the payoff can be huge.

1553
01:21:31,031 --> 01:21:34,991
You're listening to Nice Guy Johnny,
and that was your Daily Dose.

1554
01:21:35,959 --> 01:21:39,254
Let's jump on the line
and get a couple of callers.

1555
01:21:39,383 --> 01:21:42,449
This one's interesting.
This is from a...

1556
01:21:42,583 --> 01:21:45,267
first-time caller, long-time admirer,

1557
01:21:45,399 --> 01:21:48,301
Brooke, from Los Angeles
by way of Long Island.

1558
01:21:48,439 --> 01:21:49,388
Ahem.

1559
01:21:50,518 --> 01:21:53,901
Hello, Brooke, you're on the air.
What would you like to talk about?

1560
01:21:54,039 --> 01:21:57,584
<i>- Well, I actually have
a non-sports-related question,</i>

1561
01:21:57,719 --> 01:21:59,344
<i>if that's okay?
- Okay.</i>

1562
01:21:59,479 --> 01:22:01,366
I guess it depends on the question.

1563
01:22:01,494 --> 01:22:03,916
<i>- Yeah, it's sort of more
of a personal nature.</i>

1564
01:22:04,055 --> 01:22:06,870
<i>Do you take those?
- Well, this isn't Love Line, Brooke,</i>

1565
01:22:06,998 --> 01:22:10,382
but I think for this caller
I can make an exception.

1566
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:11,698
Shoot.

1567
01:22:11,832 --> 01:22:15,148
<i>- Well, I wasjust wondering
if your tennis game has improved any?</i>

1568
01:22:15,639 --> 01:22:18,574
- That's funny. That's funny.
For your information, it has not.

1569
01:22:18,712 --> 01:22:21,101
I still haven't found
a good tennis instructor.

1570
01:22:21,239 --> 01:22:24,370
<i>- Good to know you're still on the air,
doing what you love.</i>

1571
01:22:24,504 --> 01:22:27,984
- Yeah, well, I couldn't walk away
from the best job in the biz.

1572
01:22:28,119 --> 01:22:30,224
Cost me my engagement, but, uh...

1573
01:22:30,360 --> 01:22:32,465
<i>- Well, I'm... sorry to hear that.</i>

1574
01:22:32,600 --> 01:22:35,088
- No, it's okay.
I think it's for the best.

1575
01:22:35,224 --> 01:22:36,849
I'm not doing the overnight anymore.

1576
01:22:36,984 --> 01:22:40,115
I'm here on the afternoon drive slot,
so it worked out.

1577
01:22:41,399 --> 01:22:42,893
So, listeners, in case you're wondering,

1578
01:22:43,031 --> 01:22:44,820
I am speaking with the very lovely,

1579
01:22:44,951 --> 01:22:46,544
lovely Brooke Palson,

1580
01:22:46,680 --> 01:22:50,062
recent grad and All Conference
tennis star at Loyola Marymount,

1581
01:22:50,199 --> 01:22:51,792
down in Los Angeles.

1582
01:22:52,279 --> 01:22:53,742
So, Brooke...

1583
01:22:53,880 --> 01:22:55,222
enquiring minds wanna know...

1584
01:22:55,352 --> 01:22:57,425
what have you been up to?

1585
01:22:57,561 --> 01:23:00,910
<i>- I am on the road.
I'm taking that trip I told you about.</i>

1586
01:23:01,049 --> 01:23:03,154
<i>Your show came in
about an hour ago.</i>

1587
01:23:03,800 --> 01:23:05,556
- So that means
you're close to Oaktown.

1588
01:23:06,168 --> 01:23:08,110
- I don't know, how far is Napa?

1589
01:23:08,600 --> 01:23:10,258
<i>- Close enough
that if you didn't stop in</i>

1590
01:23:10,393 --> 01:23:12,335
<i>and say hello,
I might be a little offended?</i>

1591
01:23:12,473 --> 01:23:13,553
Uh...

1592
01:23:14,040 --> 01:23:17,106
So what are you doing?
Are you headed home to L.A.,

1593
01:23:17,240 --> 01:23:18,734
or are you thinking about, uh...

1594
01:23:18,873 --> 01:23:21,011
swinging by the Bay Area,
by any chance?

1595
01:23:21,144 --> 01:23:23,927
- You know what, man?
I'm just goin' where the road takes me.

1596
01:23:24,056 --> 01:23:26,445
<i>- Well, I hope that road takes you
to the studio,</i>

1597
01:23:26,584 --> 01:23:30,228
because I would love
to get that interview I was promised.

1598
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:31,920
- Oh... Really?

1599
01:23:32,056 --> 01:23:33,649
<i>- I would.</i>

1600
01:23:33,785 --> 01:23:36,306
<i>- You know,
a little begging might be in order.</i>

1601
01:23:36,441 --> 01:23:38,830
- Okay. All right. I'll beg.

1602
01:23:39,481 --> 01:23:42,231
And I think I owe you
a thank-you, as well.

1603
01:23:42,361 --> 01:23:45,427
You're the one that convinced me
I would be an idiot to leave this job.

1604
01:23:45,562 --> 01:23:46,674
So, um...

1605
01:23:47,321 --> 01:23:50,518
...here we go. Listen closely,
'cause I'm only gonna do this once.

1606
01:23:51,322 --> 01:23:54,039
Please, oh, please, Brooke,
will you come to the studio

1607
01:23:54,169 --> 01:23:55,827
so I can get that interview?

1608
01:23:56,281 --> 01:23:58,834
- You just made my father's day.

1609
01:23:58,969 --> 01:24:00,944
- Great. That makes me very happy.

1610
01:24:01,081 --> 01:24:04,910
Um... why don't you stay on the line
and I can tell you how to get here, okay?

1611
01:24:05,049 --> 01:24:07,667
<i>All right, sports fans,
I think we're in for a treat.</i>

1612
01:24:07,801 --> 01:24:09,077
<i>Especially me.</i>

1613
01:24:09,210 --> 01:24:11,665
Uh... we're gonna take
a quick commercial break.

1614
01:24:11,801 --> 01:24:14,518
You're listening to Nice Guy Johnny

1615
01:24:14,649 --> 01:24:17,911
on Oakland's
number-one sports talk, KSPT,

1616
01:24:18,041 --> 01:24:19,319
the K-Spot.

1617
01:24:20,922 --> 01:24:23,956
<i>It's a voice in the back of your mind</i>

1618
01:24:25,082 --> 01:24:27,154
<i>Oh oh oh oh oh oh</i>

1619
01:24:27,962 --> 01:24:31,475
<i>It's a song
It's a beautiful rhyme</i>

1620
01:24:32,282 --> 01:24:34,071
<i>Brooke?
Oh oh oh oh oh oh</i>

1621
01:24:34,842 --> 01:24:38,191
<i>It gets louder and louder each time</i>

1622
01:24:39,482 --> 01:24:41,718
<i>Oh oh oh oh oh oh</i>

1623
01:24:42,202 --> 01:24:45,236
<i>It's a sign that you find me all right</i>

1624

there's more to us</i>

<i>This life</i>
