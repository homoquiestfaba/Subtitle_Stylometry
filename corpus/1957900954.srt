Hello, everyone, and welcome
to Six Degrees of Santa.

7
00:00:20,281 --> 00:00:22,631
It's December first,
which means it's time

8
00:00:22,761 --> 00:00:25,547
to kick off the third
year of our project.

9
00:00:25,677 --> 00:00:27,549
Now, if you're new
to Six Degrees,

10
00:00:27,679 --> 00:00:29,507
I'm here to give
you some instructions.

11
00:00:30,508 --> 00:00:32,554
First, you want to get
one of our special boxes,

12
00:00:32,684 --> 00:00:35,296
which has the directions
on the front.

13
00:00:35,426 --> 00:00:38,386
You can order yours for free
using the link below,

14
00:00:38,516 --> 00:00:40,388
or if you're
in the New York area,

15
00:00:40,518 --> 00:00:43,260
you can pick one up at our shop,
McNevin Paper Company.

16
00:00:44,783 --> 00:00:47,612
Next, you want to pick a gift
that's meaningful to you

17
00:00:47,743 --> 00:00:50,006
and can be enjoyed
for a short period of time.

18
00:00:51,964 --> 00:00:54,271
<i>Some people choose books,
or a Christmas movie,</i>

19
00:00:54,402 --> 00:00:55,490
<i>or a game.</i>

20
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:57,231
<i>For example, a puzzle.</i>

21
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,452
<i>Pack it all up in your special
Six Degrees box</i>

22
00:01:01,583 --> 00:01:04,412
<i>and then begin your search
for Santa #2.</i>

23
00:01:05,935 --> 00:01:07,980
<i>You can choose
a complete stranger,</i>

24
00:01:08,503 --> 00:01:10,070
<i>or someone in your orbit.</i>

25
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:13,856
<i>Your neighborhood
crossing guard,</i>

26
00:01:13,986 --> 00:01:17,207
<i>or the gentleman you always see
reading on the bench.</i>

27
00:01:17,338 --> 00:01:18,774
<i>Pass it off.</i>

28
00:01:19,427 --> 00:01:21,559
<i>Then Santa #2 gets to enjoy</i>

29
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:23,387
<i>the gift for a day or two,</i>

30
00:01:25,998 --> 00:01:27,609
<i>then repacks it in this box</i>

31
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:30,873
<i>and gives it to Santa #3.</i>

32
00:01:33,441 --> 00:01:36,183
<i>Then Santa #3 hands it off...</i>

33
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,232
<i>and so on until it reaches
Santa #6,</i>

34
00:01:42,363 --> 00:01:43,712
<i>who gets to keep the gift.</i>

35
00:01:46,018 --> 00:01:48,108
Thanks, Santa! How'd you know?

36
00:01:48,238 --> 00:01:49,283
I love puzzles!

37
00:01:49,413 --> 00:01:50,588
<i>The spirit of Six Degrees</i>

38
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:52,503
<i>is to connect to the world.</i>

39
00:01:52,634 --> 00:01:54,157
By Santa #6,

40
00:01:54,288 --> 00:01:55,968
your gift will have made
its way to someone

41
00:01:56,028 --> 00:01:57,228
you could never have imagined.

42
00:01:57,334 --> 00:01:58,901
The process is anonymous.

43
00:01:59,728 --> 00:02:00,990
It's more fun that way!

44
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:02,687
You're just sharing
a bit of yourself

45
00:02:02,818 --> 00:02:05,081
and leaving the rest up
to Christmas magic.

46
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:08,215
Now, if you have any questions
or comments,

47
00:02:08,345 --> 00:02:11,131
<i>feel free to email me
at the address below.</i>

48
00:02:12,132 --> 00:02:13,916
<i>Happy gifting
and Merry Christmas!</i>

49
00:02:15,396 --> 00:02:16,919
What do you think, Director?

50
00:02:17,049 --> 00:02:19,313
I think it's our best yet!

51
00:02:19,443 --> 00:02:22,490
Well, it's December first,
so Six Degrees is live!

52
00:02:23,447 --> 00:02:24,447
Hmm!

53
00:02:25,406 --> 00:02:25,971
Did you figure out
what you're doing

54
00:02:26,102 --> 00:02:27,302
for your Six Degrees gift yet?

55
00:02:28,191 --> 00:02:29,323
I'm still deciding.

56
00:02:30,541 --> 00:02:32,195
Maybe my JingleMice
Christmas record?

57
00:02:33,153 --> 00:02:34,753
You'll never guess
what I found for mine.

58
00:02:36,982 --> 00:02:40,072
Whoa! You finally found
another copy!

59
00:02:40,203 --> 00:02:43,075
Online from a used
book store in Wisconsin.

60
00:02:44,076 --> 00:02:45,489
At least we'll always have
ours from Grandpa.

61
00:02:45,513 --> 00:02:46,601
Mm-hmm.

62
00:02:46,731 --> 00:02:48,864
Remind me, what's your
favourite part again?

63
00:02:48,994 --> 00:02:51,997
I think it's when Elfie
is in New Mexico

64
00:02:52,128 --> 00:02:53,999
and she learns about luminarias

65
00:02:54,130 --> 00:02:56,393
and how luminaria
means "light."

66
00:02:56,524 --> 00:02:59,135
Mm-hmm! Well, that's my
favourite part, too.

67
00:03:00,005 --> 00:03:01,355
And you're my little luminaria.

68
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:12,496
- Oh!
- Oh!

69
00:03:12,627 --> 00:03:14,281
Good morning, Harper. Dani.

70
00:03:14,411 --> 00:03:15,673
I hope it's okay.

71
00:03:15,804 --> 00:03:17,371
I love these for a background.

72
00:03:17,501 --> 00:03:18,937
Very wholesome.

73
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:21,201
Christmas whimsical.

74
00:03:21,331 --> 00:03:22,767
Ooh, that might be
a good hashtag.

75
00:03:22,898 --> 00:03:24,618
I'm certainly trying
to snag more followers.

76
00:03:24,682 --> 00:03:26,945
Especially with
my new crafty venture.

77
00:03:27,076 --> 00:03:28,512
Oh, that's awesome!

78
00:03:28,643 --> 00:03:31,385
Hey, you know I slipped
an invite to our small business

79
00:03:31,515 --> 00:03:32,797
Christmas party
into your mailbox.

80
00:03:32,821 --> 00:03:34,039
So, you know, you should come.

81
00:03:34,170 --> 00:03:35,693
I'll try, if I'm not swamped.

82
00:03:37,869 --> 00:03:40,481
So, wow was your date
the other night?

83
00:03:40,611 --> 00:03:41,612
Dates.

84
00:03:42,961 --> 00:03:43,658
Two different apps,
two different boroughs.

85
00:03:43,788 --> 00:03:45,312
5 PM, then 8 PM.

86
00:03:45,442 --> 00:03:47,923
They were both... okay.

87
00:03:48,053 --> 00:03:51,883
I have to say, online dating
doesn't sound exactly magical.

88
00:03:52,014 --> 00:03:53,668
It's the only way, Harper.

89
00:03:53,798 --> 00:03:55,931
You just let me know when
you decide to get out there.

90
00:03:56,061 --> 00:03:58,586
I'm happy to do a little
free consulting.

91
00:03:58,716 --> 00:04:02,111
Good to know, but it's not
exactly a priority right now.

92
00:04:03,895 --> 00:04:05,506
If you change your mind,
I'm here.

93
00:04:06,681 --> 00:04:08,422
Take care. Bye, Zoey.

94
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:12,121
Alright, let's get you
to school, huh?

95
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,742
Good morning,
my darling daughter!

96
00:04:24,873 --> 00:04:26,396
Oh! You just missed Harold.

97
00:04:26,527 --> 00:04:27,687
He dropped off another bundle

98
00:04:27,745 --> 00:04:29,007
of Six Degree boxes for you.

99
00:04:29,138 --> 00:04:30,531
Ooh!

100
00:04:33,447 --> 00:04:35,127
What do you think
of the pattern this year?

101
00:04:35,536 --> 00:04:37,059
I think it's gorgeous. Oh.

102
00:04:37,799 --> 00:04:38,799
And...

103
00:04:39,627 --> 00:04:41,803
You were mentioned
on Ivy B. Holly,

104
00:04:41,933 --> 00:04:43,333
one of my favourite
Christmas blogs.

105
00:04:44,458 --> 00:04:47,069
"Here I go,
embarking on my second year

106
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,592
of Six Degrees of Santa,

107
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:53,336
a delightful, if mysterious,
gift chain I found online.

108
00:04:53,467 --> 00:04:54,337
Check it out!"

109
00:04:54,468 --> 00:04:56,948
Isn't that what
they call trending?

110
00:04:57,079 --> 00:04:58,230
Huh? I know I've said it before,

111
00:04:58,254 --> 00:05:01,518
but I really feel like you could
go big with this.

112
00:05:01,649 --> 00:05:03,999
I don't think that counts
as trending, Mom.

113
00:05:04,129 --> 00:05:06,393
You know what,
I've said it before,

114
00:05:06,523 --> 00:05:09,221
small and personal,
you know? Almost renegade!

115
00:05:09,352 --> 00:05:10,440
That's the whole point.

116
00:05:10,571 --> 00:05:14,575
I don't mean big
like corporate partner.

117
00:05:14,705 --> 00:05:17,273
I'm saying big, like,
get some momentum behind it.

118
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:18,666
Find a way to get paid for it.

119
00:05:19,710 --> 00:05:22,844
Why? Are you firing me?

120
00:05:22,974 --> 00:05:25,760
No, I like having
you around too much.

121
00:05:27,152 --> 00:05:29,851
But your skills
are being underserved.

122
00:05:31,026 --> 00:05:34,421
What? Working with my mom
in our family company

123
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:36,945
and getting to spend
more time with my daughter?

124
00:05:38,338 --> 00:05:39,658
I'd say that counts
as fulfilling.

125
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:45,083
I suppose I'm also saying,

126
00:05:45,214 --> 00:05:47,477
who knows how much longer
this will be around.

127
00:05:50,132 --> 00:05:52,439
Do you mean that in
the philosophical sense or...

128
00:05:52,569 --> 00:05:54,005
Mom, are you worried?

129
00:05:55,224 --> 00:05:56,530
Your father was...

130
00:05:57,835 --> 00:05:59,359
better at the business side
of things.

131
00:06:01,273 --> 00:06:02,274
December just started.

132
00:06:02,405 --> 00:06:04,276
It's our busiest time.

133
00:06:05,756 --> 00:06:08,063
We just need a banner
sale season. We'll be okay.

134
00:06:08,193 --> 00:06:09,238
Okay.

135
00:06:10,805 --> 00:06:14,025
So, what do we need
for a big banner sale season?

136
00:06:14,156 --> 00:06:16,245
A rush of Christmas spirit!

137
00:06:16,898 --> 00:06:17,898
Luck.

138
00:06:19,422 --> 00:06:20,467
Oh, before you settle in,

139
00:06:20,597 --> 00:06:24,166
can you walk these packages
over to Gus?

140
00:06:24,732 --> 00:06:25,907
Please!

141
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:28,431
- Sure, Mom.
- Thank you!

142
00:06:28,562 --> 00:06:29,824
Mm-hmm!

143
00:06:31,216 --> 00:06:33,088
Alright, let's hear it,
people, let's hear it.

144
00:06:36,439 --> 00:06:37,938
Hi, everyone.
Thank you so much for coming.

145
00:06:37,962 --> 00:06:39,660
Lovely to see you all.

146
00:06:39,790 --> 00:06:42,793
Now, I am beyond thrilled

147
00:06:42,924 --> 00:06:45,709
to bring my tech brand
into the real world

148
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:49,452
and into your living rooms
on Christmas morning with...

149
00:06:49,583 --> 00:06:50,583
SparkLTree!

150
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:54,631
Partnering with farmers,

151
00:06:54,762 --> 00:06:57,068
we have engineered
what we believe to be

152
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,244
the perfect Christmas tree.

153
00:06:59,375 --> 00:07:03,814
From branch distribution,
shape, and needle retention,

154
00:07:03,945 --> 00:07:06,426
right down to that magnificent
conifer scent.

155
00:07:07,688 --> 00:07:09,864
Now, it comes in three sizes,

156
00:07:09,994 --> 00:07:10,994
but most importantly,

157
00:07:11,735 --> 00:07:13,955
it can be delivered
to your front door

158
00:07:14,085 --> 00:07:16,261
with the very simple
click of a button.

159
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,438
Are you ready?

160
00:07:24,313 --> 00:07:25,749
- Hey, Hal.
- Hey.

161
00:07:26,358 --> 00:07:27,577
What's all this?

162
00:07:27,708 --> 00:07:30,711
Oh, it's a Christmas tree
you order online.

163
00:07:30,841 --> 00:07:32,713
Apparently it's perfect.

164
00:07:32,843 --> 00:07:35,716
Ugh! Jason Sparks.

165
00:07:37,369 --> 00:07:39,391
Of course he thinks he can
invade and commodify Christmas.

166
00:07:39,415 --> 00:07:42,723
Oh, I'd suppose you've known him
from your Silicon Valley days.

167
00:07:42,853 --> 00:07:43,853
Yeah, I worked for him.

168
00:07:44,768 --> 00:07:46,006
Well, I mean,
for one of his companies.

169
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:47,554
I... I didn't know him.

170
00:07:47,684 --> 00:07:50,295
He's more of a looming presence.

171
00:07:50,426 --> 00:07:54,561
Now just think, no more
laborious trips to the farm,

172
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:56,651
having to strap your tree
to the roof of your car,

173
00:07:56,737 --> 00:07:57,433
scratching the paint.

174
00:07:57,564 --> 00:07:59,087
And if you live in the City,

175
00:07:59,217 --> 00:08:02,743
imagine not having to haul
your cumbersome Christmas trees

176
00:08:02,873 --> 00:08:04,048
seven city blocks,

177
00:08:04,179 --> 00:08:06,747
only to have it poke you
and give you splinters,

178
00:08:07,791 --> 00:08:10,533
sap all over your hands,
needles everywhere.

179
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,405
You gotta love how he pretends

180
00:08:13,536 --> 00:08:14,189
like he's doing it
for our well-being.

181
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,148
Eh, he's always been nice to me.

182
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:20,021
You would buy one
of those things?

183
00:08:21,109 --> 00:08:23,154
Yeah! I mean, look at it.

184
00:08:23,285 --> 00:08:24,852
It's a good-looking tree!

185
00:08:24,982 --> 00:08:26,810
But what about
your trip to Watson's Farm

186
00:08:26,941 --> 00:08:28,290
with Jeanie and the kids, huh?

187
00:08:28,420 --> 00:08:30,205
And hot cocoa in travel mugs?

188
00:08:30,335 --> 00:08:31,815
Uh, maybe we could just stay in,

189
00:08:31,946 --> 00:08:33,226
watch A Christmas Carol instead?

190
00:08:33,251 --> 00:08:35,036
I don't believe it.

191
00:08:35,166 --> 00:08:36,472
To be continued!

192
00:08:36,603 --> 00:08:37,603
Alright. Have a good one.

193
00:08:39,431 --> 00:08:40,998
Right to your front door.

194
00:08:43,218 --> 00:08:45,742
Thank you so much.

195
00:08:45,873 --> 00:08:47,483
Thank you.

196
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:04,166
Are you going
to get a SparkLTree?

197
00:09:06,807 --> 00:09:07,807
No.

198
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:13,117
Oh. You don't celebrate
Christmas. I'm so sorry,

199
00:09:13,248 --> 00:09:14,249
I shouldn't assume.

200
00:09:14,379 --> 00:09:16,251
Oh, no, no.
I celebrate Christmas.

201
00:09:16,773 --> 00:09:18,906
I adore Christmas.

202
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:21,561
But I also adore
real Christmas trees.

203
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,521
SparkLTrees are real
Christmas trees.

204
00:09:25,652 --> 00:09:27,828
Also, personally, you know,
I enjoy carrying my tree

205
00:09:27,958 --> 00:09:30,047
back those seven blocks
from the tree lot.

206
00:09:30,178 --> 00:09:31,962
You know,
a family-owned business,

207
00:09:32,093 --> 00:09:34,312
something that is practically disappearing.

208
00:09:34,443 --> 00:09:36,247
And if the tree wants
to poke me with its needles,

209
00:09:36,271 --> 00:09:37,446
well, I welcome it!

210
00:09:39,143 --> 00:09:40,143
Sorry, do I know you?

211
00:09:40,841 --> 00:09:42,241
Have I done something
to offend you?

212
00:09:42,277 --> 00:09:44,845
Why bother growing
living things at all, right?

213
00:09:44,975 --> 00:09:47,325
Why not just skip ahead to,
I don't know,

214
00:09:47,456 --> 00:09:48,805
a Christmas tree hologram

215
00:09:48,936 --> 00:09:50,435
that you can decorate
from your tablet?

216
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,243
That's...

217
00:09:52,374 --> 00:09:53,505
not a bad idea, actually.

218
00:09:54,855 --> 00:09:56,944
That would be
really good for travel. Hmm...

219
00:09:57,074 --> 00:09:58,685
Okay, why are you trying

220
00:09:58,815 --> 00:10:00,687
to take the heart
and magic out of Christmas?

221
00:10:02,514 --> 00:10:03,777
I think you're making a lot

222
00:10:03,907 --> 00:10:05,147
of assumptions about this tree.

223
00:10:06,344 --> 00:10:08,192
Tell you what, how about I send
you one, on the house?

224
00:10:08,216 --> 00:10:09,296
You might change your mind.

225
00:10:09,347 --> 00:10:10,435
I would send it back.

226
00:10:11,436 --> 00:10:12,612
Merry Christmas.

227
00:10:17,312 --> 00:10:18,748
Good morning, sir.

228
00:10:18,879 --> 00:10:20,271
Quick question for you, Elliott.

229
00:10:20,402 --> 00:10:21,098
Yeah, go ahead. Shoot, Boss.

230
00:10:21,229 --> 00:10:22,622
Do you think the SparkLTree

231
00:10:22,752 --> 00:10:25,712
brand fails
to exude magic and heart?

232
00:10:25,842 --> 00:10:27,690
Uh, I'd say it piggybacks
off the inherent magic

233
00:10:27,714 --> 00:10:28,410
and heart of the season?

234
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:29,700
We did have that focus group.

235
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:36,157
So... this is your
forwarded mail.

236
00:10:36,287 --> 00:10:38,507
I checked for anything
time sensitive.

237
00:10:40,030 --> 00:10:43,991
I also wasn't sure
whether to pass this one along.

238
00:10:50,737 --> 00:10:52,086
It looks great.

239
00:10:52,826 --> 00:10:54,305
Happy.

240
00:10:55,480 --> 00:10:57,000
I suppose it was only
a matter of time.

241
00:10:57,091 --> 00:11:00,007
Um, look up their registry
and send them something nice.

242
00:11:00,137 --> 00:11:01,137
Sure.

243
00:11:14,369 --> 00:11:15,544
Come in!

244
00:11:16,327 --> 00:11:17,459
Hey, you!

245
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:18,709
Hey! Happy December, Harper.

246
00:11:18,765 --> 00:11:20,375
Happy December to you too!

247
00:11:21,289 --> 00:11:23,683
Dani, your dad's here!

248
00:11:24,684 --> 00:11:25,835
And you guys better get moving.

249
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:26,859
Yeah.

250
00:11:27,599 --> 00:11:29,079
Hey, I saw Six Degrees posted.

251
00:11:30,428 --> 00:11:32,953
Yes! You know, look what
I found for my gift this year.

252
00:11:33,083 --> 00:11:34,083
- Wow!
- Mm-hmm!

253
00:11:34,171 --> 00:11:36,173
And... you're going
to give it away?

254
00:11:36,304 --> 00:11:38,915
Well, yeah. I mean, it's the
perfect thing for Six Degrees.

255
00:11:39,046 --> 00:11:41,439
You know, nobody knows it,
so it's new,

256
00:11:41,570 --> 00:11:42,876
but it's also timeless.

257
00:11:43,006 --> 00:11:44,704
And, you know, it's about
human connection.

258
00:11:45,835 --> 00:11:47,315
It basically inspired
the whole thing.

259
00:11:53,887 --> 00:11:54,887
What's up?

260
00:11:58,500 --> 00:11:59,980
Speaking of human connection,

261
00:12:02,417 --> 00:12:03,940
I've met somebody.

262
00:12:05,420 --> 00:12:07,380
And I really feel like
it's going to go somewhere.

263
00:12:07,770 --> 00:12:08,770
Her name's Sylvia.

264
00:12:10,164 --> 00:12:11,228
And I wanted to introduce her

265
00:12:11,252 --> 00:12:14,429
to Dani but I wanted
to talk to you first.

266
00:12:14,559 --> 00:12:16,170
I trust your timing
and judgment.

267
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:19,086
I'm happy for you.

268
00:12:20,827 --> 00:12:21,827
How about you?

269
00:12:23,046 --> 00:12:24,371
Anything going on
in that department?

270
00:12:24,395 --> 00:12:26,789
No. Nope, no.

271
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,008
I'm, uh...

272
00:12:28,138 --> 00:12:30,184
I'm putting all of that
on the back burner...

273
00:12:30,314 --> 00:12:31,402
Hey, Dad!

274
00:12:31,533 --> 00:12:35,102
Hey, look at you!

275
00:12:35,232 --> 00:12:36,552
Are we excited
for The Nutcracker?

276
00:12:36,625 --> 00:12:37,931
So excited!

277
00:12:39,497 --> 00:12:41,301
See, I wonder if he'll beat
the Mouse King this year.

278
00:12:41,325 --> 00:12:43,240
Dad! He always does.

279
00:12:43,371 --> 00:12:44,502
Come on, let's go.

280
00:13:17,013 --> 00:13:18,013
<i>Dear Santas,</i>

281
00:13:22,497 --> 00:13:25,326
<i>this book holds a special
place in my heart.</i>

282
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,421
I decided to go with
the Jingle Mice record.

283
00:13:33,551 --> 00:13:34,770
Oh, that's perfect!

284
00:13:34,901 --> 00:13:36,748
Do you know how many people
are going to be listening

285
00:13:36,772 --> 00:13:38,092
to your favourite
Christmas music?

286
00:13:38,992 --> 00:13:40,820
And, uh, do you have
a Santa #2 in mind?

287
00:13:41,995 --> 00:13:43,605
There's this new girl
in my class.

288
00:13:43,735 --> 00:13:45,650
She's really shy. How about you?

289
00:13:46,695 --> 00:13:47,827
You know, this year,

290
00:13:47,957 --> 00:13:49,785
I think I'm going
to be in the moment,

291
00:13:49,916 --> 00:13:51,178
go where inspiration takes me!

292
00:13:58,402 --> 00:13:59,099
Good morning, Leonard!

293
00:13:59,229 --> 00:14:00,927
Good morning, you two!

294
00:14:01,057 --> 00:14:02,687
Oh, it's the start
of your busy season, huh?

295
00:14:02,711 --> 00:14:05,540
Yes, but I love it.

296
00:14:05,670 --> 00:14:07,237
It probably sounds
kind of cheesy,

297
00:14:07,368 --> 00:14:09,805
but this time of year,
it feels extra special

298
00:14:09,936 --> 00:14:12,895
to be the person who connects
the people with the packages.

299
00:14:13,026 --> 00:14:14,505
And cards.

300
00:14:14,636 --> 00:14:16,246
It makes me feel
like a V.I.P.

301
00:14:16,377 --> 00:14:18,553
- Mm-hmm!
- Very important postman!

302
00:14:36,745 --> 00:14:37,745
Huh...

303
00:14:42,707 --> 00:14:44,622
Hey, come on,

304
00:14:44,753 --> 00:14:45,753
let's read the book.

305
00:14:46,973 --> 00:14:47,756
Jump up.

306
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:49,018
Yeah.

307
00:14:49,149 --> 00:14:50,498
What are these people doing?

308
00:14:51,716 --> 00:14:52,716
Thank you.

309
00:14:52,761 --> 00:14:54,067
And this is for you.

310
00:14:55,372 --> 00:14:58,071
♪ Craving to hold your hand

311
00:14:58,985 --> 00:15:01,901

This is for Mr. Sparks.
He gets to keep it!

316
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,665
So, Christmas
is fast approaching,

317
00:15:27,796 --> 00:15:30,407
but we are pretty much
wrapped on SparkLTree.

318
00:15:30,538 --> 00:15:33,845
Um... We deployed the updates
to the companion app.

319
00:15:33,976 --> 00:15:36,283
Music Department has added
a few extra playlists.

320
00:15:36,413 --> 00:15:38,633
For example,
"Music to open presents to."

321
00:15:40,330 --> 00:15:44,204
And, of course, there's tree
care, wrapping tips, et cetera.

322
00:15:44,334 --> 00:15:46,902
So, uh, we should be all
good to go for your hiatus.

323
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:50,906
Hiatus...

324
00:15:51,037 --> 00:15:53,256
Oh, there was this bake sale

325
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:55,606
sponsorship for a local high
school basketball team

326
00:15:55,737 --> 00:15:57,217
coming this Saturday night.

327
00:15:57,347 --> 00:15:58,392
It's really small scale.

328
00:15:58,522 --> 00:16:00,239
I'm not even sure how
the request got through.

329
00:16:00,263 --> 00:16:01,414
Do you just want
me to cancel on that...

330
00:16:01,438 --> 00:16:02,135
No.

331
00:16:02,265 --> 00:16:03,832
No.

332
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:07,986
That would go against the sincere,
down-to-earth vibe we're going for.

333
00:16:08,010 --> 00:16:09,945
No, put Fabian on it.
You can coordinate remotely.

334
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:10,969
Okay.

335
00:16:13,668 --> 00:16:15,602
Are you sure I should be
heading to Vermont tomorrow?

336
00:16:15,626 --> 00:16:16,647
Enjoy your time
with your family.

337
00:16:16,671 --> 00:16:17,454
I mean, don't forget

338
00:16:17,585 --> 00:16:19,152
to take notes on the authentic

339
00:16:19,282 --> 00:16:21,458
family Christmas
for SparkLTree 2.0.

340
00:16:23,330 --> 00:16:25,850
But you haven't spent Christmas
with your family in three years.

341
00:16:26,942 --> 00:16:28,988
I feel like it's something
you should do, yeah.

342
00:16:32,078 --> 00:16:33,862
Uh, is everything okay?

343
00:16:36,647 --> 00:16:38,127
I think so.

344
00:16:38,258 --> 00:16:41,043
Just that off feeling, you know?

345
00:16:41,174 --> 00:16:44,264
Mmm. I'm sure
it's your open calendar.

346
00:16:44,394 --> 00:16:45,700
You're not used to it.

347
00:16:45,830 --> 00:16:47,136
I think it's a good thing.

348
00:16:47,267 --> 00:16:49,921
I mean, everyone needs
to take time off at some point.

349
00:16:50,052 --> 00:16:52,272
And Christmas is as good
a time as any to...

350
00:16:53,925 --> 00:16:57,886
Reminds me, um, that box over
there is an actual present.

351
00:16:58,843 --> 00:17:00,584
Yeah, Hal passed it along,

352
00:17:00,715 --> 00:17:03,892
said some boy who's a fan
wanted to give it to you.

353
00:17:06,242 --> 00:17:07,242
Thank you.

354
00:17:43,932 --> 00:17:44,932

355
00:17:46,195 --> 00:17:48,371

00:17:49,546 --> 00:17:52,071
<i>My father gave me a copy
when I was a child.</i>

357
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:57,380
<i>I miss him so much,
especially this time of year.</i>

358
00:17:57,511 --> 00:18:00,862
<i>But the very book he gave me
always reminds me</i>

359
00:18:00,992 --> 00:18:05,780
<i>that there is love and
connection to be had everywher.</i>

360
00:18:06,563 --> 00:18:08,435
<i>Maybe even right
around the corner.</i>

361
00:18:09,392 --> 00:18:11,090
<i>I wish all of this for you.</i>

362
00:18:11,960 --> 00:18:14,702
<i>Yours, Ms. Santa #1.</i>

363
00:18:22,840 --> 00:18:23,885
This very book,

364
00:18:25,321 --> 00:18:27,584
it was like a lifeline for me
when I was young.

365
00:18:29,064 --> 00:18:31,464
My family, they moved constantly
and my uncle got this for me

366
00:18:31,588 --> 00:18:36,202
to remind me that home didn't
necessarily need to be a place.

367
00:18:37,855 --> 00:18:40,336
I lost my copy and I've been
looking for one ever since.

368
00:18:40,467 --> 00:18:41,859
And then it just shows up!

369
00:18:42,469 --> 00:18:44,514
And the note on the inside...

370
00:18:45,863 --> 00:18:49,128
it feels like it was
written by me, or for me.

371
00:18:50,694 --> 00:18:54,698
So... are we looking into
a publishing venture or...

372
00:18:54,829 --> 00:18:57,788
The fact that this found me at a
time where I'm taking a break to...

373
00:19:01,401 --> 00:19:03,707
process how I'm feeling
about my ex getting married.

374
00:19:03,838 --> 00:19:07,407
So, are we looking
to get back into dating apps?

375
00:19:07,537 --> 00:19:08,669
Cancelling your hiatus?

376
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:09,959
This isn't about the company.

377
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:14,500
All I know is...

378
00:19:15,806 --> 00:19:17,460
when I read this note
in this book,

379
00:19:18,374 --> 00:19:20,594
I felt something
I haven't felt in years.

380
00:19:21,812 --> 00:19:23,292
With all those
coincidences lining up,

381
00:19:23,379 --> 00:19:24,922
I feel like it would
be negligent not to follow

382
00:19:24,946 --> 00:19:26,513
the data,
to see where this leads.

383
00:19:28,254 --> 00:19:31,170
I have to find, to meet...

384
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,521
Ms. Santa #1.

385
00:19:40,266 --> 00:19:42,069
I just have to say,
a few of us have really been

386
00:19:42,093 --> 00:19:43,773
rooting for you to get back
out there, sir.

387
00:19:44,748 --> 00:19:47,534
Okay, it looks like
this is the website.

388
00:19:49,666 --> 00:19:52,495
It's like a chain letter,
but with gifting?

389
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:55,411
It is pretty clever,
if underdeveloped.

390
00:19:56,891 --> 00:19:58,216
There's gotta be some kind
of social media component

391
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:00,111
for all these Santas
to meet each other.

392
00:20:00,677 --> 00:20:02,984
Uh, I don't see anything.

393
00:20:04,072 --> 00:20:05,726
Let's watch this video.

394
00:20:07,336 --> 00:20:09,416
<i>Hello, everyone, and welcome
to Six Degrees of Santa.</i>

395
00:20:09,860 --> 00:20:10,644
<i>It's December first...</i>

396
00:20:10,774 --> 00:20:11,774
Wait a second.

397
00:20:12,123 --> 00:20:13,124
I've met this woman!

398
00:20:13,255 --> 00:20:15,083
Yeah, didn't she used
to work for us?

399
00:20:16,650 --> 00:20:18,086
Wait, what?

400
00:20:23,744 --> 00:20:26,877
I saw that you put
in for more boxes.

401
00:20:27,008 --> 00:20:28,507
Are you still shipping
those out, free of charge?

402
00:20:28,531 --> 00:20:31,447
Yeah! You know,
I actually mailed one off

403
00:20:31,578 --> 00:20:34,407
to Skagway, Alaska
the other day. Yeah!

404
00:20:35,930 --> 00:20:37,671
That's gotta start
adding up, sweetheart.

405
00:20:38,498 --> 00:20:40,543
Well, you know,
sometimes people choose

406
00:20:40,674 --> 00:20:43,329
to spend their money going
to Aspen for the holidays,

407
00:20:43,459 --> 00:20:44,979
but this is how
I choose to spend mind.

408
00:20:45,896 --> 00:20:46,960
Plus, you know,
it drives foot traffic

409
00:20:46,984 --> 00:20:49,509
to the store, so I think
it's win-win.

410
00:20:49,639 --> 00:20:50,771
Harper McNevin.

411
00:20:52,163 --> 00:20:53,208
You used to work for me.

412
00:20:54,383 --> 00:20:56,472
Hmm, yeah, have you popped by

413
00:20:56,603 --> 00:20:57,963
for a forgotten
performance review?

414
00:21:00,041 --> 00:21:00,737
Hi, I'm Jason Sparks.

415
00:21:00,868 --> 00:21:02,086
Oh, I know! Hi.

416
00:21:02,217 --> 00:21:04,175
I'm Pauline, Harper's mother.

417
00:21:05,220 --> 00:21:07,135
This is Elliott,
my executive assistant.

418
00:21:08,745 --> 00:21:10,399
I looked into it.

419
00:21:10,530 --> 00:21:13,272
You were one of our most
promising programmers.

420
00:21:13,402 --> 00:21:16,579
You designed Sugar Share,
charming neighborhood sharing app.

421
00:21:16,710 --> 00:21:20,061
Yeah, which your VP
of Business Development squelched

422
00:21:20,191 --> 00:21:22,629
because it didn't have enough
profit potential.

423
00:21:22,759 --> 00:21:24,587
Yeah, that happens.

424
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:25,719
Why are you here?

425
00:21:26,937 --> 00:21:28,983
Uh... and how did you find me?

426
00:21:29,113 --> 00:21:30,201
Well, as a matter of fact,

427
00:21:30,332 --> 00:21:34,554
I am a Santa #6 in
your Six Degrees of Santa chain.

428
00:21:34,684 --> 00:21:37,513
Your video indicated
I might find you here,

429
00:21:37,644 --> 00:21:41,300
and well, I was hoping you could
help me locate my original Santa.

430
00:21:42,126 --> 00:21:43,389
This is the gift I received.

431
00:21:45,565 --> 00:21:46,805
Would you look at that!
That's...

432
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:48,132
A book. Yeah, Mom.

433
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:50,309
It's a book that I've never
seen before in my life.

434
00:21:51,875 --> 00:21:55,314
So why do you have to find
this original Santa?

435
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:59,274
Well, it's important to me.

436
00:22:01,711 --> 00:22:04,105
This book was a childhood
favourite of mine.

437
00:22:05,672 --> 00:22:08,022
That, along with the note
written on the inside the cover,

438
00:22:08,936 --> 00:22:09,719
well, it made me think

439
00:22:09,850 --> 00:22:12,766
that we might possibly
share a...

440
00:22:13,897 --> 00:22:14,897
a connection.

441
00:22:15,638 --> 00:22:16,813
You mean like romantically?

442
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:18,815
Possibly. Maybe.

443
00:22:20,164 --> 00:22:22,273
Listen, I got a gut-feeling
and I simply can't ignore it.

444
00:22:22,297 --> 00:22:25,082
Huh... I'm going to go inside.

445
00:22:25,213 --> 00:22:26,649
I'm sure that I heard the phone.

446
00:22:28,390 --> 00:22:31,132
Well, I can't help you.

447
00:22:31,262 --> 00:22:34,135
The spirit of Six Degrees
is one of anonymity.

448
00:22:34,265 --> 00:22:35,658
Well, speaking of that,

449
00:22:35,789 --> 00:22:38,029
I actually have an enticing
thing to offer you in return.

450
00:22:39,183 --> 00:22:41,360
See, I think Six Degrees
has a lot of potential.

451
00:22:42,796 --> 00:22:43,796
Not interested.

452
00:22:51,413 --> 00:22:53,043
I could help you make it
a household name,

453
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:54,392
along the lines
of "White Elephant."

454
00:22:54,416 --> 00:22:57,419
We could loop in
investors, sponsors.

455
00:22:57,550 --> 00:22:59,247
And we just got
that quick analysis back.

456
00:23:00,727 --> 00:23:02,767
It would be an advantageous
follow up to SparkLTree.

457
00:23:03,686 --> 00:23:05,732
Definitely not interested.

458
00:23:06,472 --> 00:23:07,821
That's not what
the site's about.

459
00:23:07,951 --> 00:23:11,085
Though, I don't recall
seeing a copyright.

460
00:23:13,783 --> 00:23:15,239
Which means there's
nothing to stop us from

461
00:23:15,263 --> 00:23:16,503
just taking off with it anyway.

462
00:23:17,526 --> 00:23:18,526
Is that a threat?

463
00:23:19,789 --> 00:23:22,226
No, I'm just thinking out loud.

464
00:23:22,357 --> 00:23:24,161
There's gotta be some way
I can convince you to help me

465
00:23:24,185 --> 00:23:25,360
find Ms. Santa #1.

466
00:23:27,884 --> 00:23:30,757
Wait, which is it that you
want? Ms. Santa or Six Degrees?

467
00:23:31,497 --> 00:23:33,107
Well, both.

468
00:23:35,065 --> 00:23:38,286
I'm just hoping we could make a
deal, you know, help each other.

469
00:23:39,635 --> 00:23:41,507
If you really want
to help people,

470
00:23:41,637 --> 00:23:43,596
maybe help some
of the small businesses

471
00:23:43,726 --> 00:23:45,511
that your industry
is destroying.

472
00:23:45,641 --> 00:23:47,774
You mean like this one?
Sure! Easy-peasy.

473
00:23:49,558 --> 00:23:50,820
I'll tell you what.

474
00:23:50,951 --> 00:23:53,257
You help me find
Ms. Santa #1,

475
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:56,478
I'll help with your foot traffic
and marketing.

476
00:23:57,871 --> 00:24:00,134
McNevin Paper Company
will see unprecedented sales.

477
00:24:02,353 --> 00:24:05,748
Well, I mean, what if we can't
find Ms. Santa #1?

478
00:24:05,879 --> 00:24:09,056
You know, or we do
and she's like 99 years old

479
00:24:09,186 --> 00:24:12,799
or, you know, loathes
your very existence?

480
00:24:12,929 --> 00:24:15,454
I mean, do our terms
still stand?

481
00:24:15,584 --> 00:24:17,630
Sure. I don't think it'll
be any of those scenarios.

482
00:24:18,848 --> 00:24:20,284
Okay, so to confirm,

483
00:24:21,416 --> 00:24:23,810
you help boost McNevin Paper
Company sales,

484
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:26,073
and you leave Six Degrees alone.

485
00:24:26,203 --> 00:24:28,510
No push for growth from you
or any of your companies.

486
00:24:29,816 --> 00:24:30,880
This is the weirdest deal
I've ever made.

487
00:24:30,904 --> 00:24:31,905
Oh, just promise!

488
00:24:32,035 --> 00:24:34,168
I promise.

489
00:24:38,912 --> 00:24:39,912
It's a deal.

490
00:24:44,221 --> 00:24:45,484
Elliott.

491
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:55,189
So you made a deal
with him to find you.

492
00:24:55,885 --> 00:24:57,408
Correct.

493
00:24:57,539 --> 00:24:59,323
Look, I was this whirlwind
of confusion!

494
00:24:59,454 --> 00:25:01,674
You know, at first, I wanted
to protect Six Degrees,

495
00:25:01,804 --> 00:25:03,893
but then he mentioned helping
the shop,

496
00:25:04,938 --> 00:25:06,538
and I was mad I didn't
think of it first.

497
00:25:07,157 --> 00:25:08,158
Well, you have been known

498
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:10,334
to occasionally miss
the forest for the trees.

499
00:25:10,465 --> 00:25:12,423
Mmm... For the SparkLTrees.

500
00:25:14,469 --> 00:25:15,775
- Option one...
- Yeah.

501
00:25:15,905 --> 00:25:17,472
You come clean
and you tell him that

502
00:25:17,603 --> 00:25:19,039
the mystery match is you.

503
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,170
Just see where it goes!

504
00:25:21,258 --> 00:25:23,347
No! Definitely not.

505
00:25:24,871 --> 00:25:27,311
Everything about him goes against
everything that I care about.

506
00:25:28,091 --> 00:25:29,615
And I feel it would
nullify the deal.

507
00:25:29,745 --> 00:25:32,158
You know, why work up all of these
terms only to turn around and say,

508
00:25:32,182 --> 00:25:33,923
"Hey, guess what? It's me!
Pay up now!"

509
00:25:34,489 --> 00:25:35,489
No, that would never fly.

510
00:25:36,883 --> 00:25:38,711
And you know I'm not
dating right now.

511
00:25:40,060 --> 00:25:42,018
It's quite the pickle.
Mm-hmm.

512
00:25:42,584 --> 00:25:44,151
No, except, maybe not!

513
00:25:44,281 --> 00:25:47,154
You know, these tech guys are
always looking for a new project,

514
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:50,157
and then, within 48 hours,
they lose interest and move on.

515
00:25:50,287 --> 00:25:51,854
So I'm counting on that.

516
00:25:51,985 --> 00:25:54,074
No, I'm not interested
in buying more followers.

517
00:25:54,857 --> 00:25:56,250
That's so cringe.

518
00:25:57,860 --> 00:25:59,229
The only thing that concerns
me is finding something

519
00:25:59,253 --> 00:26:00,428
for him to lose interest in.

520
00:26:01,995 --> 00:26:04,214
You could just hire an actor
to play Ms. Santa #1.

521
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:07,520
Yeah, maybe someone
looking for a little publicity?

522
00:26:07,609 --> 00:26:08,609
Ah...

523
00:26:13,659 --> 00:26:16,836
You hang out with him once,
maybe twice,

524
00:26:16,966 --> 00:26:19,839
you know, take some selfies,
create some hashtags.

525
00:26:19,969 --> 00:26:23,451
It will boost your online
presence exponentially.

526
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:25,932
And it doesn't have to be
more than one day, maybe two.

527
00:26:26,062 --> 00:26:28,282
Unless you want it to be more?

528
00:26:29,326 --> 00:26:31,285
Nah, he's not my type.

529
00:26:31,415 --> 00:26:37,030
I mean, he's objectively handsome in a "pulling
off a turtleneck" sort of way. But no.

530
00:26:39,772 --> 00:26:41,425
I won't have to break up
with him, will I?

531
00:26:41,556 --> 00:26:43,514
Um, no. No.

532
00:26:43,645 --> 00:26:45,473
I guarantee that
he will lose interest.

533
00:26:46,517 --> 00:26:47,170
Not because of you!

534
00:26:47,301 --> 00:26:48,476
But because...

535
00:26:49,825 --> 00:26:51,218
the tech lizard brain.

536
00:26:52,654 --> 00:26:55,004
Look, I know that this lie
may be a little dicey.

537
00:26:55,135 --> 00:26:56,397
Are you kidding me?

538
00:26:56,527 --> 00:26:59,313
With all the hijinks that get
bandied about in the online

539
00:26:59,443 --> 00:27:01,489
dating world, this is nothing!

540
00:27:03,099 --> 00:27:06,015
Well, I prefer to see it as
an acceptable white lie

541
00:27:06,146 --> 00:27:09,889
that helps multiple
small businesses.

542
00:27:10,019 --> 00:27:11,978
All you have to do is pretend
to be Santa #1.

543
00:27:13,370 --> 00:27:14,415
This is your roadmap.

544
00:27:15,242 --> 00:27:16,939
You love this book.

545
00:27:18,332 --> 00:27:20,372
And I will text you
what I wrote in the front cover.

546
00:27:22,031 --> 00:27:24,357
Is there a chance that he can
discover that it's really you?

547
00:27:24,381 --> 00:27:25,513
No, no!

548
00:27:27,297 --> 00:27:28,516
Slim. Yeah.

549
00:27:30,344 --> 00:27:32,670
But he'd basically have to track
back through all of the Santas,

550
00:27:32,694 --> 00:27:34,054
and that's the beauty
of this plan,

551
00:27:34,130 --> 00:27:35,479
because even if he does,

552
00:27:35,610 --> 00:27:39,658
Santa #2 was Leonard,
our mailman! So, we're covered!

553
00:27:42,138 --> 00:27:43,738
Sounds easy enough!
What's the next step?

554
00:27:46,577 --> 00:27:48,362
Admiring your work?

555
00:27:50,843 --> 00:27:52,975
Just thinking ahead
to SparkLTree 2.0.

556
00:27:53,846 --> 00:27:56,413
Ooh! That sounds
Christmas magical.

557
00:27:56,544 --> 00:27:57,937
It is magical.

558
00:27:59,068 --> 00:28:01,680
Here, this is for you.

559
00:28:03,725 --> 00:28:05,466
Is this part of our deal?

560
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:07,747
No, it's just
a nice thing to do.

561
00:28:08,948 --> 00:28:09,948
Hmm.

562
00:28:13,126 --> 00:28:14,214
This is peppermint.

563
00:28:15,824 --> 00:28:16,888
I saw on your Swift-Gram
that you like the peppermint

564
00:28:16,912 --> 00:28:20,133
coffee from the kiosk
downstairs. I'm thorough.

565
00:28:22,875 --> 00:28:24,703
You seem to have
a certain idea of me.

566
00:28:25,616 --> 00:28:26,616
But that's okay.

567
00:28:27,488 --> 00:28:29,316
The lower your opinion is of me,

568
00:28:29,446 --> 00:28:31,579
the more impressive it will be
when I become...

569
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:32,710
impressive.

570
00:28:34,495 --> 00:28:38,891
Well, this impressive
journey will be brief.

571
00:28:39,021 --> 00:28:42,155
Good news! I found
Ms. Santa #1!

572
00:28:42,285 --> 00:28:45,245
Yeah, I was able to track
her back through the website

573
00:28:45,375 --> 00:28:47,856
and, you know,
it's a crazy coincidence,

574
00:28:47,987 --> 00:28:51,425
because I actually know her.
Yeah! She's my neighbour!

575
00:28:53,296 --> 00:28:56,125
Well, maybe not that crazy
a coincidence,

576
00:28:56,256 --> 00:28:57,997
since, you know,
most of the people that use

577
00:28:58,127 --> 00:28:59,452
Six Degrees of Santa
are people that I know

578
00:28:59,476 --> 00:29:04,394
because my website is so
underdeveloped, like you said.

579
00:29:05,744 --> 00:29:08,137
Her name is Zoey.
I will send you her number.

580
00:29:08,268 --> 00:29:09,419
And yeah, good luck with that.

581
00:29:09,443 --> 00:29:11,123
I'll be in touch about
my side of the deal.

582
00:29:11,227 --> 00:29:13,099
- Wait!
- What?

583
00:29:14,883 --> 00:29:16,319
That can't be it.

584
00:29:16,450 --> 00:29:17,320
I mean, especially since
you know her.

585
00:29:17,451 --> 00:29:19,279
You gotta give me
some details here.

586
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:22,325
I mean, what does she like?

587
00:29:23,718 --> 00:29:25,894
Well, she's public on all
her social media platforms,

588
00:29:26,025 --> 00:29:27,635
so, you know, figure her out,

589
00:29:28,984 --> 00:29:30,544
like you did
with the peppermint coffee.

590
00:29:31,813 --> 00:29:33,835
Isn't that how we learn
about each other these days?

591
00:29:33,859 --> 00:29:35,295
But that's not your philosophy.

592
00:29:36,470 --> 00:29:39,255
That's okay. You do you.

593
00:29:39,386 --> 00:29:42,519
Also, this doesn't seem
like a very good deal for me.

594
00:29:42,650 --> 00:29:44,565
You just give me a phone number,

595
00:29:44,695 --> 00:29:46,785
and then I help rescue
your family business?

596
00:29:46,915 --> 00:29:49,352
Rise from the ashes?
Completely save it? No.

597
00:29:49,918 --> 00:29:52,442
Why don't you come with me

598
00:29:52,573 --> 00:29:54,793
and we'll scope out
the situation a little?

599
00:29:54,923 --> 00:29:57,752
Maybe we can even organize
one of those quirky run-ins

600
00:29:57,883 --> 00:29:59,449
that they do in the movies,
you know?

601
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:01,712
- A meet-cute?
- Sure.

602
00:30:02,844 --> 00:30:04,082
How can you be one of
the most successful people

603
00:30:04,106 --> 00:30:06,152
in the world and not know
what that is?

604
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:08,440
Can't your assistant help you?

605
00:30:09,546 --> 00:30:10,946
I gave him time off
for the holiday.

606
00:30:16,553 --> 00:30:19,426
Fine, yeah. Fine.

607
00:30:19,556 --> 00:30:22,995
But you know what?
I need to call my mom first.

608
00:30:23,125 --> 00:30:24,213
- Sure.
- Yeah.

609
00:30:24,344 --> 00:30:26,781
- Tell her I say hello.
- Mmm, not likely.

610
00:30:26,912 --> 00:30:28,348
Oh man...

611
00:30:36,312 --> 00:30:39,359
Zoey, hey, okay,
bear with me here.

612
00:30:40,708 --> 00:30:42,428
We're going to need
to add a little theatre.

613
00:30:44,494 --> 00:30:49,282
She teaches workout classes,
she's some kind of influencer,

614
00:30:49,412 --> 00:30:51,632
and she also sells
artwork on Craft-Zalea.

615
00:30:51,762 --> 00:30:53,590
So she's really into
the gig economy,

616
00:30:53,721 --> 00:30:55,201
so you'll have lots
to talk about.

617
00:30:56,463 --> 00:30:57,463
She is quite pretty.

618
00:30:58,117 --> 00:30:59,117
Well, that's a win-win!

619
00:31:00,641 --> 00:31:03,078
And I also know from her feed
that she often comes here

620
00:31:03,209 --> 00:31:05,428
for a snack after teaching
a Pilates class.

621
00:31:05,559 --> 00:31:07,517
So, you know, we just have
to keep a lookout

622
00:31:07,648 --> 00:31:11,739
and maybe we can stage one of
those so-called quirky run-ins.

623
00:31:12,783 --> 00:31:14,350
Maybe you can bump into
each other,

624
00:31:14,481 --> 00:31:17,484
or you both reach for the
last pastry at the same time.

625
00:31:18,398 --> 00:31:19,790
Maybe the coffee spilling thing?

626
00:31:19,921 --> 00:31:21,792
That's usually pretty cute, no?
No?

627
00:31:21,923 --> 00:31:23,229
No. Definitely not.

628
00:31:27,189 --> 00:31:29,148
Do you think I should tell
her the whole truth?

629
00:31:29,713 --> 00:31:31,063
Like, that I sought her out?

630
00:31:32,455 --> 00:31:34,501
Well, uh, it depends.

631
00:31:36,372 --> 00:31:38,722
You know what? Maybe the fewer
the charades, the better.

632
00:31:40,246 --> 00:31:41,963
See, this is what I don't
get about Six Degrees of Santa.

633
00:31:41,987 --> 00:31:43,989
Here you have
an opportunity for a genuine,

634
00:31:44,119 --> 00:31:46,078
charade-free connection,

635
00:31:46,208 --> 00:31:47,949
and your system
literally prevents that.

636
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,908
It's not a matchmaking service.

637
00:31:50,821 --> 00:31:52,693
You know, I actually
had a dream about

638
00:31:52,823 --> 00:31:54,086
Six Degrees last night.

639
00:31:54,216 --> 00:31:56,827
Sometimes I have these
creative problem-solving dreams.

640
00:31:56,958 --> 00:31:58,588
Will you please stop dreaming
about my website?

641
00:31:58,612 --> 00:32:00,353
But it has so much
untapped potential.

642
00:32:00,483 --> 00:32:01,702
Mmm, not your problem!

643
00:32:02,790 --> 00:32:05,575
Oh, no. I need
to get a napkin.

644
00:32:05,706 --> 00:32:08,752
I will go. You stay here
and keep an eye out for Zoey.

645
00:32:08,883 --> 00:32:10,774
And you know, please,
stop dreaming about my website.

646
00:32:10,798 --> 00:32:12,365
Oh!

647
00:32:12,495 --> 00:32:15,020
Harper? My neighbour?
Is that you?

648
00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:18,326
Zoey!

649
00:32:19,502 --> 00:32:20,242
- Here, here.
- What are you doing here?

650
00:32:20,373 --> 00:32:21,461
Use this.

651
00:32:22,853 --> 00:32:24,551
No, it's too nice.

652
00:32:24,681 --> 00:32:25,944
It's fine, here.

653
00:32:28,772 --> 00:32:31,297
Hi. I'm Jason.
I'm Zoey.

654
00:32:31,993 --> 00:32:32,733
Hi, Zoey.

655
00:32:32,863 --> 00:32:33,863
Um...

656
00:32:34,474 --> 00:32:35,475
Um...

657
00:32:46,529 --> 00:32:47,313
Smells good.

658
00:32:47,443 --> 00:32:48,270
So, are you new to...

659
00:32:48,401 --> 00:32:49,924
Yeah, just around the corner.

660
00:32:50,055 --> 00:32:53,145
I teach dance fitness
and yoga. That's where I was.

661
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:58,454
O-M-G! Harper,

662
00:32:58,585 --> 00:33:00,345
you will not believe
what we just discovered!

663
00:33:00,979 --> 00:33:02,502
What did you just discover?

664
00:33:02,632 --> 00:33:06,767
Jason and I here are part
of the same Six Degrees Chain...

665
00:33:06,897 --> 00:33:09,030
that I started with a book
called Neighbourhood Elf.

666
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:10,770
Northbound Elf.

667
00:33:11,598 --> 00:33:12,598
Right!

668
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:14,557
I'm just shaken up about

669
00:33:14,688 --> 00:33:16,255
the bizarreness
of this coincidence!

670
00:33:18,387 --> 00:33:19,910
We should commemorate
this moment.

671
00:33:20,041 --> 00:33:21,695
- Yeah.
- Oh, sure, yeah. Okay.

672
00:33:33,794 --> 00:33:35,796
So, I was thinking about
the different variations

673
00:33:35,926 --> 00:33:37,286
of this Six Degrees
of Santa thing,

674
00:33:38,451 --> 00:33:40,571
and so there were four other
people in our gift chain.

675
00:33:40,757 --> 00:33:41,757
'I wonder who they were.

676
00:33:41,802 --> 00:33:43,282
Well, I know one.

677
00:33:43,412 --> 00:33:46,198
Our mailman,
Leonard, was Santa #2,

678
00:33:46,981 --> 00:33:48,635
so that's something.

679
00:33:49,462 --> 00:33:50,985
That is something.

680
00:33:55,250 --> 00:33:56,034
That's a great scarf.

681
00:33:56,164 --> 00:33:58,993
- Oh, you like it?
- Yeah.

682
00:33:59,124 --> 00:34:01,387
It's one of mine.
I mean, I designed it.

683
00:34:02,736 --> 00:34:04,433
I have a store on Craft-Zalea.

684
00:34:04,564 --> 00:34:06,261
Oh, yes. Harper mentioned

685
00:34:06,392 --> 00:34:07,673
that you were working
the gig economy.

686
00:34:07,697 --> 00:34:10,352
The shop is called Zo-Brad,

687
00:34:10,483 --> 00:34:13,703
'cause my name is Zoey Bradford
but no "E" or "Y".

688
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:16,315
In case you wanted to

689
00:34:16,445 --> 00:34:19,144
check it out, or mention it,
or hashtag it.

690
00:34:19,274 --> 00:34:20,797
Yeah, sure.

691
00:34:25,367 --> 00:34:28,066
Yeah, I can get
my social media manager on it,

692
00:34:28,196 --> 00:34:29,676
and get you a mention or two.

693
00:34:30,242 --> 00:34:31,242
Yeah.

694
00:34:33,462 --> 00:34:36,248
So... Northbound Elf.

695
00:34:36,378 --> 00:34:38,058
It seems like it really
meant a lot to you.

696
00:34:39,207 --> 00:34:42,080
Totally. Yes.

697
00:34:43,516 --> 00:34:45,953
There's this part when
Elfie is in Machu Picchu,

698
00:34:46,084 --> 00:34:48,956
and I was like...

699
00:34:49,739 --> 00:34:51,001
I need to travel more!

700
00:34:54,614 --> 00:34:57,051
That's, uh...
a worthwhile goal.

701
00:34:58,966 --> 00:34:59,966
Cheers.

702
00:35:04,189 --> 00:35:05,973
Look, this woman
had a great idea!

703
00:35:07,627 --> 00:35:09,933
She said, "This year, I gifted
a set of cookie cutters

704
00:35:10,064 --> 00:35:12,806
and my grandma's cookie recipe.

705
00:35:14,547 --> 00:35:17,115
It felt like keeping her love
alive and spreading it around.

706
00:35:18,246 --> 00:35:19,639
Thank you for making
this happen."

707
00:35:21,815 --> 00:35:23,095
Do you want to read
the next one?

708
00:35:26,428 --> 00:35:27,734
Where is Kolkata?

709
00:35:28,996 --> 00:35:29,996
What?!

710
00:35:30,824 --> 00:35:32,130
It's in India.

711
00:35:33,305 --> 00:35:35,742
It's from a young man
named Arjun.

712
00:35:36,482 --> 00:35:38,353
He's wondering how his gift...

713
00:35:39,963 --> 00:35:43,097
a snow globe from St. Louis
made it all the way to him,

714
00:35:43,228 --> 00:35:46,405
and he wants to start
his own chain.

715
00:35:47,101 --> 00:35:48,494
Can you get him a box in time?

716
00:35:49,799 --> 00:35:51,845
Oh, I don't think so, but...

717
00:35:53,629 --> 00:35:55,789
Well, what do you think we
should do, business partner?

718
00:35:57,285 --> 00:35:59,505
Could he make his own box?

719
00:36:00,506 --> 00:36:02,856
Great idea. I'll let him know.

720
00:36:07,861 --> 00:36:09,732
I finally fixed
the ordering page!

721
00:36:09,863 --> 00:36:11,343
Oh, my hero!

722
00:36:14,259 --> 00:36:16,565
Oh! You practising
for the party tonight?

723
00:36:18,654 --> 00:36:21,198
I thought you were representing us in
the wrapping competition this year.

724
00:36:21,222 --> 00:36:22,310
No, it's your turn.

725
00:36:23,920 --> 00:36:25,008
One sec.

726
00:36:25,139 --> 00:36:28,098
Oh! So, how did the date go?

727
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:29,796
I thought I did my job.

728
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:31,972
It was just bad enough,
kept it believable.

729
00:36:32,102 --> 00:36:34,540
I really played up
the insincere influencer thing.

730
00:36:35,410 --> 00:36:35,976
Zero chemistry.

731
00:36:36,106 --> 00:36:38,370
Good. Good, good, good.

732
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:40,981
Yes. Except he scheduled
a second date, for tonight!

733
00:36:42,417 --> 00:36:44,257
I don't know if he thought
it went well, or...?

734
00:36:45,159 --> 00:36:48,771
Oh. Well, I mean, did you
at least get an online boost?

735
00:36:48,902 --> 00:36:51,383
Such a boost!
Everything's gone nuts.

736
00:36:51,513 --> 00:36:53,633
I have all these orders,
so now I'm, like, overbooked.

737
00:36:54,603 --> 00:36:56,146
I don't know what to do about
this second date.

738
00:36:56,170 --> 00:36:58,390
<i>Do I go and act horribly?
Chew with my mouth open?</i>

739
00:36:59,304 --> 00:37:00,304
Let me...

740
00:37:02,350 --> 00:37:03,917
see what I can do on my end.

741
00:37:04,613 --> 00:37:05,613
Okay.

742
00:37:06,528 --> 00:37:08,791
Um, wrapping paper malfunction.

743
00:37:09,923 --> 00:37:11,446
Good morning, you two!
Here you go.

744
00:37:11,577 --> 00:37:13,405
- Hi! Oh, thanks!
- You're welcome.

745
00:37:13,535 --> 00:37:15,145
Please, feel free to browse.

746
00:37:15,276 --> 00:37:16,756
We have a friends
and family discount.

747
00:37:18,323 --> 00:37:20,760
So, how did the date go?

748
00:37:21,761 --> 00:37:23,937
The date was... not great.

749
00:37:25,634 --> 00:37:28,550
Oh! Well, I'm sorry
to hear that.

750
00:37:29,769 --> 00:37:31,969
But I've already gone ahead
and scheduled a second date.

751
00:37:32,815 --> 00:37:34,880
You know, at first I was
a little irked that it seemed

752
00:37:34,904 --> 00:37:37,559
like she was just using me to
boost her social media presence.

753
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:41,259
But then I thought, why be offended
by her being a savvy business woman?

754
00:37:42,956 --> 00:37:44,784
When I brought up
Northbound Elf, yeah,

755
00:37:44,914 --> 00:37:46,612
her response was a little flip,

756
00:37:47,743 --> 00:37:50,442
but why should I expect
her to open up right away?

757
00:37:50,572 --> 00:37:51,791
On command, you know?

758
00:37:54,576 --> 00:37:57,144
That's actually a very mature
way of looking at things.

759
00:37:59,494 --> 00:38:02,976
But didn't you have
one of those popular Life-Talks?

760
00:38:03,106 --> 00:38:05,935
You know, about sunken costs
and minimizing wasted time?

761
00:38:06,066 --> 00:38:10,288
I mean, if the first date
did not work, why not move on?

762
00:38:10,418 --> 00:38:12,768
That's what I used to do,
just move on to the next thing.

763
00:38:14,292 --> 00:38:15,747
But if this connection
felt different, then shouldn't

764
00:38:15,771 --> 00:38:16,811
I approach it differently?

765
00:38:19,079 --> 00:38:20,298
I don't know, I...

766
00:38:21,473 --> 00:38:23,910
I just don't want you
to get hurt.

767
00:38:32,048 --> 00:38:33,528
Oh, no way!

768
00:38:33,659 --> 00:38:34,660
Roller skates?

769
00:38:35,617 --> 00:38:36,617
Do you sell these?

770
00:38:37,271 --> 00:38:38,271
No, those are mine.

771
00:38:39,534 --> 00:38:42,189
And no, we do not sell them.

772
00:38:45,671 --> 00:38:49,022
Okay, quick Six Degrees
question for you.

773
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:51,720
Why stop at number six?

774
00:38:52,852 --> 00:38:54,462
Well, that's the saying,
isn't it?

775
00:38:55,202 --> 00:38:56,856
"Six degrees of separation."

776
00:38:58,553 --> 00:39:01,077
You know, and the box
won't last forever.

777
00:39:02,775 --> 00:39:04,143
And aren't you supposed to be one
of the busiest people in the world?

778
00:39:04,167 --> 00:39:05,188
I mean, how do you have time to,

779
00:39:05,212 --> 00:39:07,606
you know, hang out
and critique my hobby?

780
00:39:08,171 --> 00:39:10,826
Oh, well, I am on hiatus.

781
00:39:11,566 --> 00:39:12,872
Yeah, I'm taking a break

782
00:39:13,002 --> 00:39:14,569
from work for the first
time in years.

783
00:39:14,700 --> 00:39:16,658
Oh!

784
00:39:16,789 --> 00:39:18,530
Now it all makes sense.

785
00:39:18,660 --> 00:39:20,140
You're not looking for love.

786
00:39:21,402 --> 00:39:23,317
You are looking
for a new project!

787
00:39:23,448 --> 00:39:26,059
And maybe that's something
that I can help you with.

788
00:39:26,189 --> 00:39:28,235
You know, we can spitball
some ideas, huh?

789
00:39:28,366 --> 00:39:30,474
I mean, why don't we revisit
the Christmas tree hologram

790
00:39:30,498 --> 00:39:31,780
that I pitched you
in the elevator?

791
00:39:31,804 --> 00:39:33,501
Yeah? Or, um... I mean,

792
00:39:33,632 --> 00:39:35,677
what is the SparkLTree
of Valentine's Day?

793
00:39:36,243 --> 00:39:37,462
How about we discuss

794
00:39:37,592 --> 00:39:40,726
the sales makeover
I had planned for this place?

795
00:39:41,466 --> 00:39:43,250
Sure, yeah.

796
00:39:43,381 --> 00:39:44,581
Talk to me. Where do we start?

797
00:39:46,514 --> 00:39:51,171
Done. I just dropped you
the SparkLTree companion app.

798
00:39:51,301 --> 00:39:53,652
There's a new feature
on the McNevin Paper Company.

799
00:39:53,782 --> 00:39:55,610
I filed it under
gift wrapping ideas.

800
00:39:55,741 --> 00:39:57,421
I thought that was
the perfect home for it.

801
00:39:57,525 --> 00:40:00,180
I just, I thought we were
working on this together.

802
00:40:02,443 --> 00:40:06,186
You know, I have to admit,
this is... it's not bad.

803
00:40:08,362 --> 00:40:10,190
But this seems very generous.

804
00:40:17,763 --> 00:40:19,939
Oh, it's Zoey. She just
cancelled our date tonight.

805
00:40:23,638 --> 00:40:24,378
You know what?

806
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:26,032
Maybe the significance of all

807
00:40:26,162 --> 00:40:28,730
of this is that your heart
is open.

808
00:40:28,861 --> 00:40:31,690
You know? So why don't you
try online dating, huh?

809
00:40:31,820 --> 00:40:32,952
That's a project!

810
00:40:34,344 --> 00:40:38,044
Oh, can you believe
Haley just cancelled?

811
00:40:38,174 --> 00:40:40,699
You're going to have to find
somebody else to compete against.

812
00:40:43,876 --> 00:40:46,313
Well, unless Jason could do it.

813
00:40:49,664 --> 00:40:51,274
Uh, I do have
the night free now.

814
00:40:51,405 --> 00:40:54,974
Can we really invite
Jason Sparks to a small business

815
00:40:55,104 --> 00:40:56,802
Christmas party
for local businesses?

816
00:40:58,934 --> 00:41:00,414
Yeah, that is a pickle.

817
00:41:00,545 --> 00:41:02,634
Oh, heck. Let's just
put him in a disguise!

818
00:41:05,201 --> 00:41:09,336
Ho-ho-ho! Merry Christmas!

819
00:41:14,776 --> 00:41:17,083
- Hey, Mom!
- Hey, honey! Ooh!

820
00:41:18,519 --> 00:41:19,825
Who is this?

821
00:41:19,955 --> 00:41:23,002
Oh! Why, I'm Santa, of course.

822
00:41:23,785 --> 00:41:25,004
This is Jason, he is a...

823
00:41:26,092 --> 00:41:27,093
a work colleague?

824
00:41:28,573 --> 00:41:30,009
This is my daughter, Dani.

825
00:41:30,139 --> 00:41:32,620
Hi, Dani. It's very
nice to meet you.

826
00:41:32,751 --> 00:41:34,579
Now, tell me, how were
my Santa belly laughs?

827
00:41:34,709 --> 00:41:36,450
And be honest,
on a scale of one to ten?

828
00:41:38,365 --> 00:41:41,194
Uh, maybe five.

829
00:41:41,977 --> 00:41:43,370
Geez, tough crowd.

830
00:41:44,197 --> 00:41:45,391
Well, I appreciate your honesty.

831
00:41:45,415 --> 00:41:48,288
Maybe I'll even hire you
on as a Santa consultant.

832
00:41:48,418 --> 00:41:49,898
We could use somebody
like you around.

833
00:41:53,162 --> 00:41:55,991
I hope everyone is enjoying

834
00:41:56,122 --> 00:41:59,647
this celebration of Christmas
and local small business!

835
00:41:59,778 --> 00:42:00,909
As many of you know,

836
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:06,088
we have our traditional
gift wrapping tournament,

837
00:42:06,219 --> 00:42:09,048
sponsored by the McNevin
Paper Company!

838
00:42:09,178 --> 00:42:10,876
The McNevin family
is being represented

839
00:42:11,006 --> 00:42:12,834
by my daughter Harper this year,

840
00:42:12,965 --> 00:42:16,490
who will compete against
a customary celebrity guest.

841
00:42:16,621 --> 00:42:20,494
And this year,
our celebrity is Santa Claus!

842
00:42:21,930 --> 00:42:23,541
Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho!

843
00:42:25,020 --> 00:42:26,282
Thank you, young lady.

844
00:42:26,413 --> 00:42:27,806
You've been a good girl
this year.

845
00:42:27,936 --> 00:42:31,679
Oh! Well, competitors
will be judged on speed,

846
00:42:31,810 --> 00:42:34,247
technique, and creativity!

847
00:42:36,815 --> 00:42:38,077
Thank you.

848
00:42:39,513 --> 00:42:40,882
You know, I hope you're ready
for defeat.

849
00:42:40,906 --> 00:42:42,081
I grew up in this industry,

850
00:42:42,211 --> 00:42:43,735
so, I was somewhat

851
00:42:43,865 --> 00:42:46,302
of a wunderkind and I've
only improved from there.

852
00:42:46,433 --> 00:42:48,478
You know, I'm not so bad myself.

853
00:42:49,305 --> 00:42:50,829
It's all about making
shapes and forms,

854
00:42:50,959 --> 00:42:55,311
and my visuospatial ability
is unparalleled.

855
00:42:55,442 --> 00:42:56,574

00:44:02,814 --> 00:44:03,814
What?!

875
00:44:09,037 --> 00:44:11,344
Ho-ho-ho, everybody wins
on Christmas!

876
00:44:23,748 --> 00:44:26,794
There has been
a noticeable increase

877
00:44:26,925 --> 00:44:29,144
in our online sales
for the last few hours.

878
00:44:29,275 --> 00:44:31,886
Well, that must be from Jason
putting us up on his app.

879
00:44:32,017 --> 00:44:34,759
Oh, tech mogul who's actually

880
00:44:34,889 --> 00:44:36,369
good at what he does.

881
00:44:42,027 --> 00:44:44,420
I didn't know that Zoey
was coming.

882
00:44:44,551 --> 00:44:45,813
Yeah...

883
00:44:45,944 --> 00:44:47,423
I forgot I invited her,

884
00:44:47,554 --> 00:44:50,470
otherwise I would have
warned Jason.

885
00:44:50,600 --> 00:44:52,211
She stood him up today.

886
00:44:53,865 --> 00:44:55,562
Wasn't that basically your plan?

887
00:44:56,955 --> 00:44:59,522
Uh, yea... yeah...

888
00:44:59,653 --> 00:45:01,568
I mean... but it's awkward.

889
00:45:03,831 --> 00:45:06,312
I'm beginning to feel guilty.

890
00:45:06,442 --> 00:45:08,227
What do you think would happen
if I told him?

891
00:45:10,229 --> 00:45:12,057
There's only one way
to find out.

892
00:45:22,763 --> 00:45:24,156
That was really fun.

893
00:45:24,286 --> 00:45:26,071
Yes.

894
00:45:26,201 --> 00:45:28,551
- One Santa suit.
- Ah.

895
00:45:28,682 --> 00:45:32,425
And one... sweater.

896
00:45:32,555 --> 00:45:34,253
Thank you.

897
00:45:39,911 --> 00:45:42,304
- I have to tell you something...
- So, I came clean... Oh.

898
00:45:42,435 --> 00:45:44,350
- You go.
- I just wanted to tell you

899
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:47,440
that Zoey apologized for
cancelling our date earlier.

900
00:45:48,354 --> 00:45:50,878
So, feeling inspired,

901
00:45:51,009 --> 00:45:55,274
I came clean that I sought
her out as Miss Santa #1.

902
00:45:55,404 --> 00:45:58,103
And I told her that you were
kind enough to help me out.

903
00:46:00,018 --> 00:46:01,715
Wow. That's...

904
00:46:01,846 --> 00:46:03,064
That's great news.

905
00:46:03,195 --> 00:46:07,286
It must feel really good
to get that off your chest.

906
00:46:07,416 --> 00:46:09,462
Yeah. Yeah.

907
00:46:09,592 --> 00:46:12,291
She took it surprisingly well.

908
00:46:12,421 --> 00:46:14,380
She wasn't even mad at all.

909
00:46:15,207 --> 00:46:17,209
You know, like, yes,

910
00:46:17,339 --> 00:46:20,386
I wish that we had connected
more on our date,

911
00:46:20,516 --> 00:46:24,433
but it's just that gut-feeling
I got from the book

912
00:46:24,564 --> 00:46:27,175
and... I just feel like

913
00:46:27,306 --> 00:46:29,656
I have to see it through,
you know?

914
00:46:31,266 --> 00:46:33,660
You gotta follow
that gut-feeling, I guess.

915
00:46:37,011 --> 00:46:38,578
Yeah.

916
00:46:39,971 --> 00:46:42,190
Uh, so sorry, what were
you gonna say earlier?

917
00:46:42,321 --> 00:46:47,674
Oh, um, yeah, I wanted to say...

918
00:46:51,896 --> 00:46:53,636
thank you.

919
00:46:53,767 --> 00:46:56,117
You've been a lot of help today

920
00:46:56,248 --> 00:47:01,340
and my mom says that online
sales are definitely up.

921
00:47:02,428 --> 00:47:04,560
So...
Well, you're welcome.

922
00:47:04,691 --> 00:47:07,389
You know, I really meant it when
I said you had beautiful store.

923
00:47:07,520 --> 00:47:11,176
I love this place,
so, I'm happy to help.

924
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:17,747
If only we could find out
how the present

925
00:47:17,878 --> 00:47:20,141
made it halfway
across the world.

926
00:47:20,272 --> 00:47:21,969
You know how this works:

927
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,841
Anonymous Christmas magic.

928
00:47:23,971 --> 00:47:25,755
I just wish Arjun in India

929
00:47:25,886 --> 00:47:28,802
could talk to a Santa #1
about St. Louis.

930
00:47:28,933 --> 00:47:31,109
Or that one dad could send
the thank you note

931
00:47:31,239 --> 00:47:33,039
about the ukulele
that changed his son's life.

932
00:47:34,677 --> 00:47:36,549
Finish getting ready, okay?

933
00:47:36,679 --> 00:47:38,377
We gotta get you to school.

934
00:47:42,555 --> 00:47:44,818
I think I may actually
like Jason.

935
00:47:48,256 --> 00:47:49,867
Come on in.

936
00:47:49,997 --> 00:47:51,259
I mean, I don't...

937
00:47:51,390 --> 00:47:54,045
not like him in an epic way.

938
00:47:54,175 --> 00:47:55,829
I felt bad about cancelling,

939
00:47:55,960 --> 00:47:57,700
so I came to your party
to cheer myself up,

940
00:47:57,831 --> 00:47:59,354
not knowing he'd be there.

941
00:47:59,485 --> 00:48:02,488
Then... I saw him.

942
00:48:04,055 --> 00:48:06,796
And then there
was something lively.

943
00:48:06,927 --> 00:48:09,234
And maybe something
sweet about him?

944
00:48:09,364 --> 00:48:12,019
Something I missed earlier?

945
00:48:12,150 --> 00:48:14,804
I suppose he's had a few
surprising moments.

946
00:48:14,935 --> 00:48:17,024
Right?!

947
00:48:17,155 --> 00:48:19,200
Anyway, I don't know
if this is good or bad,

948
00:48:19,331 --> 00:48:20,898
cause... you know?

949
00:48:22,421 --> 00:48:24,336
The web of lies.

950
00:48:26,207 --> 00:48:29,863
No, I think that this
is great news.

951
00:48:29,994 --> 00:48:32,344
And if it does work out
with you two, then...

952
00:48:32,474 --> 00:48:35,477
The book did bring you together,
just indirectly.

953
00:48:35,608 --> 00:48:38,480
And this is a thing we review...

954
00:48:38,611 --> 00:48:40,091
down the road?

955
00:48:44,660 --> 00:48:47,925
We cannot deny,
Jason really helped us.

956
00:48:48,969 --> 00:48:50,362
He did.

957
00:48:58,936 --> 00:49:00,807
You didn't tell him, did you?

958
00:49:00,938 --> 00:49:02,069
I couldn't.

959
00:49:02,200 --> 00:49:04,550
I just saw how earnest
he is in his pursuit,

960
00:49:04,680 --> 00:49:05,943
and... I chickened out.

961
00:49:06,073 --> 00:49:09,424
Plus, you know, Zoey says
she may actually be into him.

962
00:49:09,555 --> 00:49:11,513
So, if I told him the truth,
I could ruin things

963
00:49:11,644 --> 00:49:12,950
for both of them.

964
00:49:13,863 --> 00:49:16,214
So, is that it then?

965
00:49:16,344 --> 00:49:18,042
The deal is all done?

966
00:49:18,172 --> 00:49:20,174
Well, he helped us out.

967
00:49:20,305 --> 00:49:23,177
He left Six Degrees alone and...

968
00:49:23,308 --> 00:49:27,486
maybe I didn't connect him
to the real Miss Santa #1...

969
00:49:28,574 --> 00:49:30,576
- You.
- Yes, but I did provide him

970
00:49:30,706 --> 00:49:32,099
with a connection.

971
00:49:32,230 --> 00:49:34,145
A better one, so...

972
00:49:36,930 --> 00:49:38,845
He helped McNevin Paper Company.

973
00:49:40,194 --> 00:49:41,761
Maybe when everything
slows down,

974
00:49:41,891 --> 00:49:43,937
you bring him some of those
pastries you brought in.

975
00:49:44,068 --> 00:49:46,070
A good old-fashioned
thank you, hmm?

976
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:47,767
Yeah.

977
00:49:56,515 --> 00:49:59,300
Wow, you are bad
at being on hiatus.

978
00:50:00,562 --> 00:50:02,564
Come in.

979
00:50:02,695 --> 00:50:04,871
Yeah, I um...

980
00:50:05,872 --> 00:50:08,092
I don't know where else to go.

981
00:50:08,222 --> 00:50:09,745
Really?

982
00:50:09,876 --> 00:50:11,704
With all your resources?

983
00:50:13,575 --> 00:50:16,361
So, are things back up
and running with Zoey?

984
00:50:17,884 --> 00:50:21,409
Yes, yes. We are getting
dinner tonight, actually.

985
00:50:21,540 --> 00:50:22,889
Good.

986
00:50:26,675 --> 00:50:28,938
The book that started it all.

987
00:50:32,290 --> 00:50:34,031
Ah, Luminarias.

988
00:50:35,336 --> 00:50:37,599
You know it means illumination?

989
00:50:38,774 --> 00:50:41,603
Did you know the tradition
stems from small fires

990
00:50:41,734 --> 00:50:43,779
used to guide scouts
and spirits home?

991
00:50:43,910 --> 00:50:45,694
I did.

992
00:50:45,825 --> 00:50:47,609
- Hmm.
- You should read it.

993
00:50:47,740 --> 00:50:49,568
Borrow it and take it home
to Dani.

994
00:50:52,223 --> 00:50:54,355
Uh, well, the reason
I texted you

995
00:50:54,486 --> 00:50:57,793
is I wanted to bring you
these as a thank you.

996
00:50:57,924 --> 00:51:00,231
Sales are definitely up.

997
00:51:00,361 --> 00:51:02,494
Oh, that's great, thank you.

998
00:51:03,451 --> 00:51:04,583
What are they?

999
00:51:04,713 --> 00:51:06,106
They're <i>kidyos.</i>

1000
00:51:06,237 --> 00:51:08,587
It's an east Indian
Christmas dessert.

1001
00:51:09,849 --> 00:51:12,330
Dani and I, we have
this little project,

1002
00:51:12,460 --> 00:51:14,810
we read emails we get
from Six Degree Santas,

1003
00:51:14,941 --> 00:51:16,682
and when we get one
from somewhere new,

1004
00:51:16,812 --> 00:51:19,685
we look up their traditions
and we make something.

1005
00:51:19,815 --> 00:51:23,428
And Dani's in charge,
so it's usually sweets.

1006
00:51:24,646 --> 00:51:26,170
Oh, wow, these are really good.

1007
00:51:26,300 --> 00:51:27,562
Mm-hmm.

1008
00:51:27,693 --> 00:51:30,043
Okay, okay, fine.

1009
00:51:30,174 --> 00:51:31,914
Fine, let's take a stab
at improving

1010
00:51:32,045 --> 00:51:34,047
Six Degrees together.

1011
00:51:34,178 --> 00:51:35,614
What? Really?

1012
00:51:35,744 --> 00:51:36,864
Wait, are you making a joke?

1013
00:51:36,963 --> 00:51:38,704
No, it's...

1014
00:51:38,834 --> 00:51:41,446
Something Dani said
made me reconsider and...

1015
00:51:42,838 --> 00:51:45,624
Well, I suppose you had
a few good points...

1016
00:51:45,754 --> 00:51:48,017
- Mm, yes!
- here and there.

1017
00:51:48,148 --> 00:51:49,821
Are you fist pumping
because you're excited

1018
00:51:49,845 --> 00:51:51,760
about connecting people,

1019
00:51:51,891 --> 00:51:54,067
or because you think you won
an ongoing argument?

1020
00:51:55,373 --> 00:51:56,809
Can't it be both?

1021
00:51:58,637 --> 00:52:01,292
Dani, hurry up please!
I gotta go!

1022
00:52:01,422 --> 00:52:02,684
Wow, you put the tree up.

1023
00:52:02,815 --> 00:52:05,034
Ah, yeah.

1024
00:52:05,165 --> 00:52:06,534
Uh, thanks for doing this
so last minute,

1025
00:52:06,558 --> 00:52:08,037
I only need half a day,

1026
00:52:08,168 --> 00:52:09,735
so I can pick up Dani
on the way back.

1027
00:52:09,865 --> 00:52:11,128
Uh, no worries.

1028
00:52:11,258 --> 00:52:13,434
I think it's cool that
you're beefing up Six Degrees.

1029
00:52:13,565 --> 00:52:16,437
Oh, well, let's not get
ahead of ourselves,

1030
00:52:16,568 --> 00:52:18,396
but maybe.

1031
00:52:18,526 --> 00:52:20,659
Uh, quick question.

1032
00:52:20,789 --> 00:52:22,289
You wouldn't happen to be collaborating

1033
00:52:22,313 --> 00:52:24,663
with this fellow, would you?

1034
00:52:28,623 --> 00:52:30,016
I've seen that look.

1035
00:52:30,973 --> 00:52:32,714
I...

1036
00:52:32,845 --> 00:52:35,021
I can't believe you
even follow him.

1037
00:52:35,152 --> 00:52:37,066
Well, he has good
life hacking tips.

1038
00:52:37,197 --> 00:52:39,156
All I'm saying...

1039
00:52:39,286 --> 00:52:42,333
is that I'm sensing a new kind
of energy from you right now.

1040
00:52:42,463 --> 00:52:46,337
It's either this new project,
or Santa Claus here, or both.

1041
00:52:47,425 --> 00:52:49,035
Hey, either way,

1042
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,429
you should let yourself have it.

1043
00:52:51,559 --> 00:52:53,431
Like I said the day,

1044
00:52:53,561 --> 00:52:56,564
I'm putting all of that
on the back-burner.

1045
00:52:56,695 --> 00:52:59,785
And either way,
it's a non-starter,

1046
00:52:59,915 --> 00:53:02,135
because he's dating
my neighbour.

1047
00:53:04,398 --> 00:53:05,530
Oh.

1048
00:53:09,751 --> 00:53:12,014
I think a wall would be
a good middle ground

1049
00:53:12,145 --> 00:53:14,103
for people to post publicly,

1050
00:53:14,234 --> 00:53:17,281
similarly that they would
a product review,

1051
00:53:17,411 --> 00:53:19,283
do you know what I mean?

1052
00:53:19,413 --> 00:53:22,764
Like, "Hey, loved
the reindeer sock puppet,

1053
00:53:22,895 --> 00:53:25,202
would Santa #1
like to come forward?"

1054
00:53:25,332 --> 00:53:27,813
You know?
Yeah, but that's where

1055
00:53:27,943 --> 00:53:29,989
the whole social media
element could go wrong,

1056
00:53:30,119 --> 00:53:33,514
you know? It could lead
to competing and outdoing...

1057
00:53:37,301 --> 00:53:38,824
Is that Zoey?

1058
00:53:40,391 --> 00:53:43,742
No, it's, um,
it's Fabian Lambert,

1059
00:53:43,872 --> 00:53:45,744
you know, the celebrity chef?

1060
00:53:45,874 --> 00:53:48,181
I hired him for a bake sale fundraiser

1061
00:53:48,312 --> 00:53:50,009
for this high school
basketball team,

1062
00:53:50,139 --> 00:53:51,706
no cause too small.

1063
00:53:53,055 --> 00:53:55,710
No, Zoey is away for the day,
she's doing some

1064
00:53:55,841 --> 00:53:59,497
Business Ladies Who Craft,
or something? I don't know.

1065
00:53:59,627 --> 00:54:02,239
I'm sorry, what were you saying?

1066
00:54:03,196 --> 00:54:06,547
Yeah, um, right. Um, okay...

1067
00:54:06,678 --> 00:54:09,985
So what if you're a young girl
who gets gifted,

1068
00:54:10,116 --> 00:54:12,423
um, you know, a hacky sack?

1069
00:54:12,553 --> 00:54:16,340
And then you look online
and then you start to see the...

1070
00:54:18,124 --> 00:54:19,865
I am so sorry.

1071
00:54:19,995 --> 00:54:21,955
Let me just finish this up
and we can focus, okay?

1072
00:54:21,997 --> 00:54:23,260
Sure.

1073
00:54:27,481 --> 00:54:29,353
Hey, what flavour
sounds better to you,

1074
00:54:29,483 --> 00:54:31,137
lavender or cardamom?

1075
00:54:32,225 --> 00:54:34,314
For a Christmas thing?

1076
00:54:34,445 --> 00:54:36,403
I'll just tell him to do both.

1077
00:54:36,534 --> 00:54:40,059
Ooh, how about this?
Maple gelatin caviar?

1078
00:54:40,189 --> 00:54:41,589
That seems kind of seasonal, right?

1079
00:54:41,713 --> 00:54:43,454
For a bake sale.

1080
00:54:43,584 --> 00:54:45,325
Why are you getting

1081
00:54:45,456 --> 00:54:47,458
molecular gastronomy
involved in this?

1082
00:54:47,588 --> 00:54:49,677
It's just what Fabian does.

1083
00:54:49,808 --> 00:54:51,331
It'll be very
high-profile stuff.

1084
00:54:51,462 --> 00:54:54,465
It's for a high school
bake sale.

1085
00:54:54,595 --> 00:54:57,250
I mean, what is it that
you've been going for

1086
00:54:57,381 --> 00:55:00,819
brand-wise lately?
Down to earth and sincere?

1087
00:55:01,689 --> 00:55:03,212
Uh-huh.

1088
00:55:03,343 --> 00:55:05,214
I've got a great idea.

1089
00:55:05,345 --> 00:55:06,651
Get your coat.

1090
00:55:12,918 --> 00:55:14,746
Trust me, this is going
to be great marketing.

1091
00:55:14,876 --> 00:55:17,052
For this bake sale,
Jason Sparks doesn't just

1092
00:55:17,183 --> 00:55:20,142
throw money at it, no, no,
he puts his back into it.

1093
00:55:20,273 --> 00:55:22,580
He's just like us.

1094
00:55:22,710 --> 00:55:24,103
Well, that's great,

1095
00:55:24,233 --> 00:55:27,846
but cooking isn't exactly
in my skill set.

1096
00:55:27,976 --> 00:55:30,762
Hmm. Well, I'm gonna teach you

1097
00:55:30,892 --> 00:55:33,939
how to make my dad's molasses
spice cookies.

1098
00:55:34,069 --> 00:55:35,984
They're world-famous.

1099
00:55:36,115 --> 00:55:39,553
And my world famous I mean that
they are Dani's favourite, so...

1100
00:55:39,684 --> 00:55:42,600
You have to wear this.

1101
00:55:42,730 --> 00:55:44,428
Okay.

1102
00:55:44,558 --> 00:55:46,038
Thank you.

1103
00:55:47,474 --> 00:55:50,085
Not bad, not bad. Okay.

1104
00:55:57,310 --> 00:56:00,748
So with this, you want to stir
it seven times clockwise

1105
00:56:00,879 --> 00:56:02,837
and three times
counter-clockwise

1106
00:56:02,968 --> 00:56:03,968
and repeat it four times.

1107
00:56:04,056 --> 00:56:05,797
Uh, okay...

1108
00:56:09,104 --> 00:56:12,369
Hey, wait a second! You guys
are pulling my leg, I knew it.

1109
00:56:13,805 --> 00:56:15,459
Okay, so then you're gonna
use spoons...

1110
00:56:19,680 --> 00:56:21,595
Yeah, put your back into it.

1111
00:56:21,726 --> 00:56:22,814
That's it.

1112
00:56:22,944 --> 00:56:24,903
And right next to it?

1113
00:56:25,033 --> 00:56:28,123
Actually, if you turn this
upside down, then right side up,

1114
00:56:28,254 --> 00:56:31,083
you get more cookies.
Oh, clever.

1115
00:56:32,650 --> 00:56:35,087
Alright. Sweetie,
it's time for you to go

1116
00:56:35,217 --> 00:56:37,002
get ready for your
grandma's sleepover.

1117
00:56:37,132 --> 00:56:39,308
And yes, you can take
some cookies with you.

1118
00:56:41,093 --> 00:56:42,703
Thanks, Mom.

1119
00:56:42,834 --> 00:56:45,489
Hey, you know what? I think
we made some darn good cookies

1120
00:56:45,619 --> 00:56:47,969
here tonight, let's have it,
up top, come on.

1121
00:56:48,100 --> 00:56:51,799
Alright. Oh yeah, yeah,
there we go.

1122
00:56:56,804 --> 00:56:58,806
It was really nice hanging out
with Dani today.

1123
00:56:58,937 --> 00:57:00,678
Isn't she the best?

1124
00:57:00,808 --> 00:57:02,680
She is.

1125
00:57:02,810 --> 00:57:04,333
Thank you.

1126
00:57:05,813 --> 00:57:09,817
As a matter of fact,
I'm thinking of recruiting her

1127
00:57:09,948 --> 00:57:13,865
as my decorative consultant
for SparkLTree 2.0.

1128
00:57:13,995 --> 00:57:16,781
Well, good luck with that,

1129
00:57:16,911 --> 00:57:18,783
you know,
because she's an artist,

1130
00:57:18,913 --> 00:57:23,178
so her approach is pure
and can't be commercialized.

1131
00:57:23,309 --> 00:57:25,790
We'll see about that.

1132
00:57:27,487 --> 00:57:29,402
So, um...

1133
00:57:30,751 --> 00:57:33,014
is Dani's father in the picture?

1134
00:57:33,145 --> 00:57:35,495
Yeah, Derrick.

1135
00:57:35,626 --> 00:57:38,411
Um, actually, he lives
in New York City

1136
00:57:38,542 --> 00:57:42,067
and he's one of the reasons
that we moved back here.

1137
00:57:43,285 --> 00:57:44,809
And you guys get along,
you're doing

1138
00:57:44,939 --> 00:57:46,375
the co-parenting thing?

1139
00:57:46,506 --> 00:57:48,465
Yeah, we do.

1140
00:57:48,595 --> 00:57:51,859
And you know, we were just
better off as friends and...

1141
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:53,774
well, we respect each other,
and I...

1142
00:57:53,905 --> 00:57:55,559
I think that's important.

1143
00:57:58,170 --> 00:58:00,564
So...

1144
00:58:00,694 --> 00:58:02,130
what about you?

1145
00:58:02,261 --> 00:58:04,829
What's your story?

1146
00:58:06,526 --> 00:58:07,875
Um...

1147
00:58:09,529 --> 00:58:11,749
Well, uh,

1148
00:58:11,879 --> 00:58:13,683
I suppose I used to spend
a lot of time bouncing

1149
00:58:13,707 --> 00:58:16,188
from project to project,

1150
00:58:16,318 --> 00:58:18,756
and with my relationships,

1151
00:58:18,886 --> 00:58:22,063
I was always weighing
the risks versus reward.

1152
00:58:22,194 --> 00:58:25,197
And often it seemed easier
to just move on.

1153
00:58:26,894 --> 00:58:31,116
But then you begin to realize
that something's missing,

1154
00:58:31,246 --> 00:58:33,118
which is why I had such
a strong reaction

1155
00:58:33,248 --> 00:58:35,512
to Northbound Elf
showing up in my life again.

1156
00:58:36,600 --> 00:58:38,253
You know what's odd?

1157
00:58:39,733 --> 00:58:42,344
I still don't really feel
that Zoey matches the book

1158
00:58:42,475 --> 00:58:44,042
or the feeling in the note

1159
00:58:44,172 --> 00:58:45,367
and certainly not
the feeling I had

1160
00:58:45,391 --> 00:58:47,872
when the book showed up
on my doorstep. I mean...

1161
00:58:50,701 --> 00:58:52,354
Listen, I know how silly

1162
00:58:52,485 --> 00:58:54,792
this sounds, all this
over a children's book.

1163
00:58:54,922 --> 00:58:56,968
No, it's not.

1164
00:58:57,098 --> 00:58:58,535
It's not silly.

1165
00:59:01,102 --> 00:59:02,539
Actually, um...

1166
00:59:03,844 --> 00:59:05,237
I have to tell you something.

1167
00:59:09,371 --> 00:59:12,418
Um, I know Northbound Elf.

1168
00:59:14,594 --> 00:59:18,555
Yeah, it was an important part
of my childhood too.

1169
00:59:18,685 --> 00:59:22,297
It inspired Six Degrees
a little.

1170
00:59:22,428 --> 00:59:25,213
I guess what I'm trying
to say is,

1171
00:59:25,344 --> 00:59:28,782
when you talk about
how important it is to you,

1172
00:59:28,913 --> 00:59:30,436
I understand.

1173
00:59:34,222 --> 00:59:36,311
Why didn't you tell me this?

1174
00:59:37,835 --> 00:59:40,098
Well, I suppose I didn't see
you as an ally at first.

1175
00:59:44,798 --> 00:59:47,192
I mean, why would I share
that part of myself with you?

1176
00:59:50,456 --> 00:59:52,284
I can understand that.

1177
00:59:53,981 --> 00:59:56,027
But you know, for somebody
who has a lot to say

1178
00:59:56,157 --> 00:59:58,290
about human connection,
you sure do keep a lot

1179
00:59:58,420 --> 01:00:00,118
about yourself under lockdown.

1180
01:00:01,859 --> 01:00:03,991
Might be something
I have to work on, I guess.

1181
01:00:06,951 --> 01:00:09,431
So, Mr. Big Tech Entrepreneur

1182
01:00:09,562 --> 01:00:12,565
who, you know, occasionally
burns batches of cookies.

1183
01:00:12,696 --> 01:00:14,132
Um...

1184
01:00:15,655 --> 01:00:17,918
what do you say we have
a little fun?

1185
01:00:21,226 --> 01:00:23,794
So, roller-skating, huh?

1186
01:00:23,924 --> 01:00:26,535
Not ice skating?
Isn't that more seasonal?

1187
01:00:26,666 --> 01:00:30,583
Well, this is indoors,
therefore, anytime.

1188
01:00:32,280 --> 01:00:34,476
You know, I used to skate around
this store when I was younger,

1189
01:00:34,500 --> 01:00:35,980
but then I remembered this place

1190
01:00:36,110 --> 01:00:38,547
and that you have
nighttime access.

1191
01:00:38,678 --> 01:00:40,941
I see.

1192
01:00:41,072 --> 01:00:43,988
We can skate through a forest
of Christmas trees.

1193
01:00:44,902 --> 01:00:46,512
SparkLTrees.

1194
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:49,384
Yeah, SparkLTrees.

1195
01:00:49,515 --> 01:00:51,386
We should play some music.

1196
01:00:51,517 --> 01:00:53,780
SparkLTree comes with a free app

1197
01:00:53,911 --> 01:00:56,391
featuring such things
as tree care instructions

1198
01:00:56,522 --> 01:00:58,567
and such playlists as

1199
01:00:58,698 --> 01:01:00,569
"Music to Open Presents to."
Ooh.

1200
01:01:00,700 --> 01:01:02,025
"Dancing around
the Christmas Tree."

1201
01:01:02,049 --> 01:01:02,876
Mm-hmm.

1202
01:01:03,007 --> 01:01:05,313
"Falling in Love
at Christmas."

1203
01:01:06,445 --> 01:01:08,447
You should save
that one for Zoey.

1204
01:01:18,718 --> 01:01:20,067
Okay.

1205
01:01:20,198 --> 01:01:21,895
So, I know this
is supposed to be

1206
01:01:22,026 --> 01:01:23,767
a stress-relieving activity,

1207
01:01:23,897 --> 01:01:26,639
so I promise not to make fun
of you if you wobble,

1208
01:01:26,770 --> 01:01:28,728
as long as you promise

1209
01:01:28,859 --> 01:01:30,643
not to make fun of my wobbles.
Yeah?

1210
01:01:30,774 --> 01:01:32,558
- Deal.
- Deal.

1211
01:01:34,125 --> 01:01:35,493
I can see why you would make
assumptions about me

1212
01:01:35,517 --> 01:01:37,868
given that I am
a techie-numbers guy.

1213
01:01:37,998 --> 01:01:40,914
- Mm-hmm.
- And by numbers guy I mean...

1214
01:01:41,959 --> 01:01:44,135
number one skater
in the entire lobby.

1215
01:01:45,440 --> 01:01:48,139
Whew.
What?!

1216
01:01:48,269 --> 01:01:49,880
You tricked me.

1217
01:01:50,010 --> 01:01:53,057
- You underestimated me.
- Seems I have.

1218
01:01:56,451 --> 01:01:57,888
Okay.

1219
01:01:58,018 --> 01:02:00,194
Okay, what you got then?
Yeah?

1220
01:02:00,325 --> 01:02:02,109
Come on, here we go.

1221
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,894
There we go.

1222
01:02:06,200 --> 01:02:07,724
There you go, there you go.

1223
01:02:08,637 --> 01:02:11,075
Whew!

1224
01:02:13,991 --> 01:02:15,862
Go on, then.
I'll spin around ya.

1225
01:02:15,993 --> 01:02:18,473
- Yeah?
- Whew!

1226
01:02:22,477 --> 01:02:25,176
Oh!

1227
01:02:32,226 --> 01:02:34,620
Ah!

1228
01:02:35,752 --> 01:02:36,883
Are you happy?

1229
01:02:42,280 --> 01:02:44,630
<i>Happy holidays!</i>

1230
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:48,155
<i>We hope you enjoyed this music
along with your SparkLTree,</i>

1231
01:02:48,286 --> 01:02:51,028
<i>and that you sparkle
all the way.</i>

1232
01:02:53,944 --> 01:02:56,685
I wanted your opinion
on something

1233
01:02:56,816 --> 01:02:58,775
as a potential
SparkLTree customer.

1234
01:03:00,341 --> 01:03:03,083
Okay, not even a potential
SparkLTree customer,

1235
01:03:03,214 --> 01:03:04,650
but how can I help?

1236
01:03:12,701 --> 01:03:14,462
I thought we'd do a little
quality control check

1237
01:03:14,486 --> 01:03:15,879
from this angle.

1238
01:03:16,009 --> 01:03:17,576
Well, this is how
the kids see it.

1239
01:03:17,706 --> 01:03:19,491
Exactly.

1240
01:03:21,058 --> 01:03:22,886
I used to love doing this
when I was a kid.

1241
01:03:25,018 --> 01:03:26,585
So, uh,

1242
01:03:26,715 --> 01:03:29,544
what made you move
towards agriculture?

1243
01:03:29,675 --> 01:03:31,808
What inspired SparkLTree?

1244
01:03:33,810 --> 01:03:35,159
My uncle.

1245
01:03:36,638 --> 01:03:38,945
Yeah, we were always very close.

1246
01:03:39,076 --> 01:03:41,252
In fact, he was the one that
gave me Northbound Elf

1247
01:03:41,382 --> 01:03:42,906
when I was a kid.

1248
01:03:46,126 --> 01:03:48,278
After my parents passed away
when I was in grad school,

1249
01:03:48,302 --> 01:03:50,522
he became the family that
I would spend Christmas with.

1250
01:03:51,915 --> 01:03:54,352
One year, I visited him
on Christmas Eve.

1251
01:03:55,875 --> 01:03:58,269
And I had been working
like crazy,

1252
01:03:58,399 --> 01:04:01,402
he had hurt his back
and he was living alone

1253
01:04:01,533 --> 01:04:03,274
and didn't have
a Christmas tree.

1254
01:04:04,318 --> 01:04:05,450
It broke my heart.

1255
01:04:07,321 --> 01:04:09,647
I started thinking, if we can
get everything else delivered,

1256
01:04:09,671 --> 01:04:11,630
then why not a Christmas tree?

1257
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:14,024
And not just if you live
near a farm, you know?

1258
01:04:15,329 --> 01:04:18,071
So, I partnered
with some farmers

1259
01:04:18,202 --> 01:04:19,725
who were struggling
to stay in business

1260
01:04:19,856 --> 01:04:22,728
and invited them to participate.

1261
01:04:23,685 --> 01:04:25,035
Worked out well for everyone.

1262
01:04:26,601 --> 01:04:30,388
What... So, SparkLTrees
actually helps the farmers?

1263
01:04:31,389 --> 01:04:32,651
Yeah, of course.

1264
01:04:32,781 --> 01:04:35,393
I needed their skills
and they were helped by mine.

1265
01:04:37,786 --> 01:04:39,310
Wow.

1266
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:43,053
Here I was, being such a...

1267
01:04:44,184 --> 01:04:45,490
brat...

1268
01:04:45,620 --> 01:04:47,231
about everything.

1269
01:04:49,059 --> 01:04:50,427
It's fine, I'm used
to people jumping

1270
01:04:50,451 --> 01:04:51,888
to the worst conclusions.

1271
01:04:56,414 --> 01:04:58,764
You know, the other beautiful
thing about SparkLTree?

1272
01:05:01,071 --> 01:05:02,942
It's extremely profitable
as an untapped part

1273
01:05:03,073 --> 01:05:05,640
of the Christmas market.
Oh... You-

1274
01:05:22,440 --> 01:05:23,920
It's Zoey.

1275
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,881
Well, that's... that's good.

1276
01:05:29,012 --> 01:05:30,622
That's a good thing.

1277
01:05:34,147 --> 01:05:36,454
We should probably
call it a night.

1278
01:05:42,764 --> 01:05:45,071
Okay, regarding Six Degrees,

1279
01:05:45,202 --> 01:05:47,944
and I know I'm supposed
to be on hiatus here.

1280
01:05:51,512 --> 01:05:55,864
I don't know how to explain it,
this feels personal.

1281
01:05:55,995 --> 01:05:58,563
Fun, I mean...

1282
01:05:58,693 --> 01:06:01,044
<i>It feels like a field trip.
I don't know.</i>

1283
01:06:01,174 --> 01:06:03,568
Okay, do you want me
to have Leon start

1284
01:06:03,698 --> 01:06:04,980
printing you out the paperwork?
Yes, but not

1285
01:06:05,004 --> 01:06:06,440
the typical paperwork.

1286
01:06:06,571 --> 01:06:08,486
I'd like to get the copyright
process started,

1287
01:06:08,616 --> 01:06:10,140
fast-tracked out if possible.

1288
01:06:10,270 --> 01:06:11,663
<i>So, we are looking
at a takeover?</i>

1289
01:06:11,793 --> 01:06:15,058
No. No, no, no.
This is just protective.

1290
01:06:15,188 --> 01:06:17,451
And find a team of coders
looking to make

1291
01:06:17,582 --> 01:06:18,975
<i>some holiday pay.</i>

1292
01:06:19,105 --> 01:06:22,543
I'll also keep trying to track
down copies of Northbound Elf.

1293
01:06:22,674 --> 01:06:24,074
Is it okay for me
to use your handle

1294
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:25,285
to really get it out there?

1295
01:06:25,416 --> 01:06:26,983
<i>Yeah, of course.</i>

1296
01:06:27,853 --> 01:06:29,159
Although...

1297
01:06:32,466 --> 01:06:34,251
may have a better angle.

1298
01:06:36,166 --> 01:06:37,863
Hmm.

1299
01:06:41,562 --> 01:06:43,347
I couldn't help but notice
that your dad's

1300
01:06:43,477 --> 01:06:45,958
molasses spiced cookies
are trending.

1301
01:06:46,089 --> 01:06:47,264
What?

1302
01:06:47,394 --> 01:06:52,051
Oh, yeah Jason had this
fundraiser emergency,

1303
01:06:52,182 --> 01:06:55,968
so I convinced him
to bake himself.

1304
01:06:56,099 --> 01:06:58,231
It was fun

1305
01:06:58,362 --> 01:07:00,494
watching him try to work
a rolling pin.

1306
01:07:00,625 --> 01:07:05,499
Oh, is this part of the deal
or a distraction tactic?

1307
01:07:05,630 --> 01:07:08,198
No, it just sort of happened.

1308
01:07:10,678 --> 01:07:13,029
I'm letting him help me
with Six Degrees.

1309
01:07:14,682 --> 01:07:16,336
You must really trust him.

1310
01:07:16,467 --> 01:07:18,034
I do.

1311
01:07:19,687 --> 01:07:21,820
I just wish he had a reason
to trust me back.

1312
01:07:22,864 --> 01:07:25,389
I wish I'd come clean earlier.

1313
01:07:25,519 --> 01:07:28,827
Now I'm in this... pickle,

1314
01:07:28,957 --> 01:07:30,655
as you like to say.

1315
01:07:32,526 --> 01:07:34,789
It turns out Jason Sparks
is a...

1316
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,226
is a good guy.

1317
01:07:37,575 --> 01:07:39,925
Earnestly looking
for something real.

1318
01:07:42,145 --> 01:07:44,060
What if he has found it?

1319
01:07:45,539 --> 01:07:47,846
With the real Miss Santa #1?

1320
01:07:49,065 --> 01:07:51,023
What if you went ahead
and told him?

1321
01:07:51,154 --> 01:07:55,419
No. If I told him,
he'd be mad, and upset.

1322
01:07:56,507 --> 01:07:58,596
And it would ruin
things for everyone.

1323
01:07:58,726 --> 01:08:02,121
Him, me, and Zoey.

1324
01:08:02,252 --> 01:08:04,428
And I still have Dani
to think of.

1325
01:08:05,777 --> 01:08:07,996
You know, what if this journey
of his is...

1326
01:08:08,127 --> 01:08:09,824
is just a phase?

1327
01:08:09,955 --> 01:08:12,044
You know,
like I originally thought.

1328
01:08:12,175 --> 01:08:14,829
Looks like you have thought
of all the possible

1329
01:08:14,960 --> 01:08:16,788
bad outcomes.

1330
01:08:16,918 --> 01:08:19,095
Which is the sensible thing.

1331
01:08:19,225 --> 01:08:21,619
No, I think that this is best.

1332
01:08:23,011 --> 01:08:24,970
It means the least number
of people get hurt.

1333
01:08:26,711 --> 01:08:29,714
Either way, he'll fall so in
love with Zoey it won't matter.

1334
01:08:29,844 --> 01:08:31,672
Or...

1335
01:08:31,803 --> 01:08:34,893
He'll forget and move on
to the next thing.

1336
01:08:35,763 --> 01:08:37,983
What about your feelings?

1337
01:08:39,071 --> 01:08:40,464
I'll get past it.

1338
01:08:42,596 --> 01:08:44,729
I have a lot
that's good in life.

1339
01:08:49,299 --> 01:08:51,214
That your book,
Northbound Elf,

1340
01:08:51,344 --> 01:08:54,391
meant the world
to me when I was young,

1341
01:08:54,521 --> 01:08:57,133
and recently came back
into my life in a very...

1342
01:08:57,263 --> 01:08:59,657
auspicious and unexpected way.

1343
01:08:59,787 --> 01:09:02,138
I have searched high and low

1344
01:09:02,268 --> 01:09:04,575
and I am astounded at how hard
it is to find a copy,

1345
01:09:04,705 --> 01:09:06,161
and I recently discovered
it's been out of print

1346
01:09:06,185 --> 01:09:07,273
since the 90s?

1347
01:09:07,404 --> 01:09:08,666
It wasn't a big seller.

1348
01:09:08,796 --> 01:09:10,320
Well, let me tell you
from experience,

1349
01:09:10,450 --> 01:09:12,322
the world was missing out.

1350
01:09:12,452 --> 01:09:15,412
Now, I'm somebody
who's fortunate enough

1351
01:09:15,542 --> 01:09:18,197
to be in a position
to bring it back.

1352
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:21,679
And it's actually
gaining momentum

1353
01:09:21,809 --> 01:09:24,160
since I posted about it online.

1354
01:09:24,290 --> 01:09:26,074
Here, have a look at this.

1355
01:09:26,205 --> 01:09:28,512
You're trending.
Do you believe that?

1356
01:09:31,819 --> 01:09:34,170
Is this something you might
consider bringing back to life?

1357
01:09:36,302 --> 01:09:38,522
This offer's come up before.

1358
01:09:38,652 --> 01:09:40,915
And from what I understand,

1359
01:09:41,046 --> 01:09:43,570
republishing isn't fiscally advantageous

1360
01:09:43,701 --> 01:09:45,920
unless a substantial
part of it is digital.

1361
01:09:46,051 --> 01:09:49,359
And that just
doesn't feel right.

1362
01:09:49,489 --> 01:09:52,057
I was thinking, print only,

1363
01:09:52,188 --> 01:09:55,539
hard back,
for that exact same reason.

1364
01:09:58,194 --> 01:10:00,152
- I'm trending, am I?
- Yes, you are.

1365
01:10:08,943 --> 01:10:12,208
Gosh, thanks for walking me
all this way.

1366
01:10:12,338 --> 01:10:14,775
You're like a real... gentleman.

1367
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:17,952
This is me.

1368
01:10:18,083 --> 01:10:19,693
Yes, I know.

1369
01:10:19,824 --> 01:10:22,566
I was here the other night,
baking up a storm.

1370
01:10:22,696 --> 01:10:24,307
Harper helped you
with that bake sale?

1371
01:10:24,437 --> 01:10:25,917
Yeah.

1372
01:10:26,047 --> 01:10:28,367
And this whole time I thought
you came with cooking skills.

1373
01:10:29,921 --> 01:10:31,361
Guess I usually hire
people for that.

1374
01:10:32,663 --> 01:10:34,708
So, um,

1375
01:10:34,839 --> 01:10:35,970
I'll see you tomorrow?

1376
01:10:36,101 --> 01:10:37,537
Christmas Eve?

1377
01:10:37,668 --> 01:10:39,757
- I'd like that.
- Okay.

1378
01:11:04,651 --> 01:11:06,262
It's you.

1379
01:11:06,392 --> 01:11:09,439
- Yeah, hi.
- Ah.

1380
01:11:09,569 --> 01:11:11,615
Oh wait, are you Leonard?

1381
01:11:11,745 --> 01:11:13,443
- I certainly am.
- No way,

1382
01:11:13,573 --> 01:11:16,097
we were just talking about you.
That's so crazy.

1383
01:11:16,228 --> 01:11:17,708
You're like Cupid, you know?

1384
01:11:17,838 --> 01:11:19,884
You know, part of
the Six Degrees of Santa chain

1385
01:11:20,014 --> 01:11:21,973
that brought us together.
Guilty as charged.

1386
01:11:23,191 --> 01:11:25,019
You know, I figured
that out also.

1387
01:11:25,150 --> 01:11:27,892
You know, I follow you
on social media.

1388
01:11:28,022 --> 01:11:30,155
- Yeah? Oh.
- My son works in tech

1389
01:11:30,286 --> 01:11:33,506
so I gotta stay up on things,
you know?

1390
01:11:33,637 --> 01:11:35,813
I saw the pictures
of the two of you

1391
01:11:35,943 --> 01:11:37,989
and the post about
the Northbound Elf.

1392
01:11:38,119 --> 01:11:40,426
I put two and two together.

1393
01:11:40,557 --> 01:11:42,689
Santa #2.

1394
01:11:42,820 --> 01:11:46,867
I'm glad you found each other,
but you better treat her right,

1395
01:11:46,998 --> 01:11:48,695
because she's one
of the good ones.

1396
01:11:48,826 --> 01:11:50,741
And her daughter too. So sweet.

1397
01:11:50,871 --> 01:11:53,265
Wait, daughter?

1398
01:11:54,397 --> 01:11:56,137
- Yeah.
- Who are you talking about?

1399
01:11:57,269 --> 01:11:59,532
Uh, Harper
and her daughter Dani.

1400
01:11:59,663 --> 01:12:02,274
Oh, yeah, no. Wrong person.

1401
01:12:02,405 --> 01:12:04,798
So, uh, Harper started
Six Degrees of Santa,

1402
01:12:04,929 --> 01:12:07,888
but the original Santa
in our chain was Zoey.

1403
01:12:08,019 --> 01:12:12,763
Okay, I hate to quibble,
but I'm positive.

1404
01:12:12,893 --> 01:12:17,463
Yeah, Harper McNevin,
Santa #1 in 32A,

1405
01:12:17,594 --> 01:12:20,945
left Northbound Elf
in my car right here.

1406
01:13:11,909 --> 01:13:14,172
One sec.

1407
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:17,871
Hello.
<i>Hey.</i>

1408
01:13:18,002 --> 01:13:20,918
Harper, it's Elliott,
Jason Spark's assistant.

1409
01:13:21,048 --> 01:13:22,572
Yeah, I know who you are.

1410
01:13:22,702 --> 01:13:25,836
Um, Merry Christmas Eve Eve.

1411
01:13:25,966 --> 01:13:28,752
<i>Sorry, I'm just a little
out of sorts.</i>

1412
01:13:28,882 --> 01:13:31,885
Uh... I'm calling because...

1413
01:13:32,016 --> 01:13:33,820
Have you by chance spoken
to Jason at all today?

1414
01:13:33,844 --> 01:13:35,280
To Jason?

1415
01:13:35,411 --> 01:13:38,022
No, no, we haven't spoken
since yesterday.

1416
01:13:38,152 --> 01:13:39,676
<i>Maybe he's with Zoey.</i>

1417
01:13:42,026 --> 01:13:44,898
Well, I haven't been able
to reach him all evening,

1418
01:13:45,029 --> 01:13:48,728
which is unusual, so,
I just started to worry.

1419
01:13:48,859 --> 01:13:51,818
Um, if you happen to see him,
can you just tell him

1420
01:13:51,949 --> 01:13:54,014
I have a few important updates
on the Six Degrees domain?

1421
01:13:54,038 --> 01:13:57,041
<i>Also, he'll definitely be able
to fast-track securing</i>

1422
01:13:57,171 --> 01:13:58,851
<i>the copyright, so,
no need to worry about...</i>

1423
01:13:58,912 --> 01:14:02,046
Wait, copyright?
From My Six Degrees?

1424
01:14:02,176 --> 01:14:03,526
That's the one.

1425
01:14:03,656 --> 01:14:05,005
<i>Unless there's two?</i>

1426
01:14:05,136 --> 01:14:07,138
No, I never agreed
to any of that.

1427
01:14:07,268 --> 01:14:09,140
I can't believe that Jason...

1428
01:14:21,631 --> 01:14:22,893
Harper...

1429
01:14:23,023 --> 01:14:24,871
So, I guess you're just
gonna do whatever you want

1430
01:14:24,895 --> 01:14:26,331
with Six Degrees?

1431
01:14:27,637 --> 01:14:28,717
What are you talking about?

1432
01:14:28,812 --> 01:14:31,292
Well, Elliott called me,
looking for you,

1433
01:14:31,423 --> 01:14:33,904
and I guess, well,
he let the cat out of the bag.

1434
01:14:34,034 --> 01:14:37,429
Something about
copyright and Six Degrees.

1435
01:14:37,560 --> 01:14:40,171
Wait, look, I know this
may look bad, but it's...

1436
01:14:40,301 --> 01:14:42,434
No, I just don't know
what's worse.

1437
01:14:42,565 --> 01:14:44,523
If this was part of your plan
all along

1438
01:14:44,654 --> 01:14:46,612
or if you just couldn't
help yourself.

1439
01:14:46,743 --> 01:14:48,832
I thought we made a deal.

1440
01:14:49,746 --> 01:14:51,748
Did we have a deal?

1441
01:14:53,140 --> 01:14:55,578
You mean the deal where
you help me find Miss Santa ♪1

1442
01:14:55,708 --> 01:14:57,318
and then I help you
with your shop

1443
01:14:57,449 --> 01:14:59,146
and leave your site alone?

1444
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,454
Well, you didn't hold up
your end of the deal.

1445
01:15:02,585 --> 01:15:04,369
So it looks like
we're in a grey area.

1446
01:15:04,500 --> 01:15:05,849
Grey area?

1447
01:15:05,979 --> 01:15:08,112
No, I connected you to Zoey,

1448
01:15:08,242 --> 01:15:10,027
I did my part,
and I found your...

1449
01:15:10,157 --> 01:15:11,681
your person.

1450
01:15:13,465 --> 01:15:15,206
That's not who you found.

1451
01:15:17,338 --> 01:15:19,689
I know Zoey is not
Miss Santa #1.

1452
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:30,221
Okay, yeah, um, you're right.

1453
01:15:32,223 --> 01:15:33,529
I'm sorry.

1454
01:15:35,443 --> 01:15:37,228
Is there anything else
you'd like to confess?

1455
01:15:40,231 --> 01:15:42,059
Yeah, it's just, the thing is...

1456
01:15:44,148 --> 01:15:47,238
Um, I thought that
you and Zoey...

1457
01:15:49,893 --> 01:15:52,417
I meant to tell you
that it wasn't her.

1458
01:15:54,071 --> 01:15:56,987
But then it seemed that you guys
might be good for each other

1459
01:15:57,117 --> 01:15:59,816
and... I didn't want
to interfere with that.

1460
01:16:02,601 --> 01:16:04,472
And...

1461
01:16:04,603 --> 01:16:07,258
you needed me to hold up
my end of the deal.

1462
01:16:07,998 --> 01:16:10,609
Yeah. Yeah.

1463
01:16:10,740 --> 01:16:12,698
I needed help
with the paper company

1464
01:16:12,829 --> 01:16:15,005
and I wanted you to leave
Six Degrees alone.

1465
01:16:16,397 --> 01:16:19,444
Well, mission accomplished.

1466
01:16:20,837 --> 01:16:22,477
You don't have to worry
about Six Degrees.

1467
01:16:28,322 --> 01:16:29,672
I think you should go.

1468
01:16:35,329 --> 01:16:39,769
You know, I know I may not
have been on all the up and up.

1469
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:43,599
But Zoey's great.

1470
01:16:45,470 --> 01:16:47,603
And I think you deserve
someone great too.

1471
01:17:04,271 --> 01:17:05,621
Ooh.

1472
01:17:08,058 --> 01:17:10,930
Ooh.
Ah.

1473
01:17:11,061 --> 01:17:12,802
Another one for the books.

1474
01:17:14,455 --> 01:17:17,589
What are you so absorbed in?

1475
01:17:17,720 --> 01:17:19,678
I'm just getting more and more
of these emails

1476
01:17:19,809 --> 01:17:22,202
from Six Degrees people.
Like, look!

1477
01:17:22,333 --> 01:17:24,552
"Thank you for
the Christmas magic."

1478
01:17:24,683 --> 01:17:27,904
<i>"Konichiwa</i>
from Six Degrees Kyoto,

1479
01:17:28,034 --> 01:17:29,645
please tell my Santa ♪1

1480
01:17:29,775 --> 01:17:31,647
that their gift
changed my life."

1481
01:17:33,039 --> 01:17:35,128
I'm seeing now that
there's such a yearning

1482
01:17:35,259 --> 01:17:37,000
to connect to each other.

1483
01:17:40,351 --> 01:17:43,006
Am I limiting the joy
of this project?

1484
01:17:43,136 --> 01:17:45,617
Maybe Jason was right.

1485
01:17:46,836 --> 01:17:48,272
I thought he was helping you.

1486
01:17:50,143 --> 01:17:52,015
I wasn't really letting him.

1487
01:17:53,581 --> 01:17:56,889
We had a big fight.

1488
01:17:57,020 --> 01:17:59,587
And mostly because I was trying

1489
01:17:59,718 --> 01:18:02,373
to protect Six Degrees,
you know? And for what?

1490
01:18:03,330 --> 01:18:04,680
It just seems so silly now.

1491
01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:10,860
Now I've missed out
on two great things.

1492
01:18:15,865 --> 01:18:18,215
I tell you what
I won't miss out on...

1493
01:18:19,390 --> 01:18:21,697
That holiday casserole of yours.

1494
01:18:23,046 --> 01:18:24,787
Come on, let's get packed up.

1495
01:18:24,917 --> 01:18:26,223
Okay.

1496
01:18:32,490 --> 01:18:34,971
And that's how I found out
that you were not Santa #1.

1497
01:18:36,407 --> 01:18:39,279
It feels good to have
this weight off my chest.

1498
01:18:39,410 --> 01:18:43,327
Also, I'm so sorry about taking
advantage of your social media.

1499
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:47,113
But I gotta say,
it's been life-changing.

1500
01:18:47,244 --> 01:18:48,941
It's no problem, really.

1501
01:18:49,072 --> 01:18:50,900
And I can keep that up,
it's easy.

1502
01:18:54,991 --> 01:18:56,079
You seem off.

1503
01:18:56,993 --> 01:18:58,646
Is everything okay?

1504
01:18:58,777 --> 01:19:00,692
I mean, the past week
of lies aside.

1505
01:19:03,913 --> 01:19:06,002
I know Harper is Miss Santa #1.

1506
01:19:06,132 --> 01:19:09,092
What?! No way!

1507
01:19:12,182 --> 01:19:13,182
I know.

1508
01:19:16,795 --> 01:19:18,144
Now all the weight's
off my chest.

1509
01:19:21,844 --> 01:19:23,759
To be fair, we were all
knotted up about it.

1510
01:19:24,977 --> 01:19:27,284
At some point,
we just found ourselves

1511
01:19:27,414 --> 01:19:28,676
at this point of no return.

1512
01:19:28,807 --> 01:19:30,026
Mm-hmm.

1513
01:19:34,291 --> 01:19:36,772
Elliott, what are you doing
here?

1514
01:19:36,902 --> 01:19:38,686
I am so sorry to interrupt.

1515
01:19:38,817 --> 01:19:41,602
I saw this reservation
in your calendar

1516
01:19:41,733 --> 01:19:44,301
and you haven't been answering
the phone so I started to worry

1517
01:19:44,431 --> 01:19:46,956
but I, uh...

1518
01:19:48,087 --> 01:19:49,654
suppose I can see why.

1519
01:19:50,960 --> 01:19:53,049
I wanted to make sure
you were alive,

1520
01:19:53,179 --> 01:19:56,792
and if you were alive,
which you are,

1521
01:19:56,922 --> 01:20:00,578
to tell you that I think
I messed things up with Harper.

1522
01:20:00,708 --> 01:20:03,755
I called her to see
if she'd heard from you

1523
01:20:03,886 --> 01:20:05,472
and I didn't know
I wasn't supposed to bring up

1524
01:20:05,496 --> 01:20:07,280
the copyright.

1525
01:20:07,411 --> 01:20:09,805
It's quite alright.
It doesn't matter anymore.

1526
01:20:11,154 --> 01:20:12,914
Zoey, this is my executive
assistant Elliott.

1527
01:20:13,025 --> 01:20:14,679
Elliott, this is Zoey.

1528
01:20:16,333 --> 01:20:18,161
Please, have a seat. Join us.

1529
01:20:20,293 --> 01:20:22,948
I thought it was the book that
was supposed to be a secret.

1530
01:20:24,689 --> 01:20:27,300
Oh, no, it was supposed to be
a secret from her, wasn't it?

1531
01:20:27,431 --> 01:20:28,998
No, no. Harper.

1532
01:20:30,564 --> 01:20:32,455
I'm having Northbound Elf
republished in hardback

1533
01:20:32,479 --> 01:20:33,654
for Harper.

1534
01:20:33,785 --> 01:20:35,831
Wait, it wasn't for Zoey?

1535
01:20:38,703 --> 01:20:40,531
Uh, no.

1536
01:20:44,622 --> 01:20:46,885
In the end, Harper deceived me,

1537
01:20:47,016 --> 01:20:50,410
but it led to you,
me and Zoey here

1538
01:20:50,541 --> 01:20:52,195
on this lovely date right now.

1539
01:20:53,109 --> 01:20:55,459
But, let's face it,

1540
01:20:55,589 --> 01:20:57,389
I'm not the person
you're supposed to be with.

1541
01:20:57,461 --> 01:20:59,985
No, no, you are.

1542
01:21:00,116 --> 01:21:02,205
You're falling in love
with her, aren't you?

1543
01:21:04,424 --> 01:21:07,079
You are falling
in love with Harper!

1544
01:21:08,646 --> 01:21:10,319
You and I meant well,
but we have terrible chemistry.

1545
01:21:10,343 --> 01:21:12,128
And Northbound Elf
did nothing for me.

1546
01:21:13,956 --> 01:21:15,479
Now all the weight's
off my chest.

1547
01:21:16,219 --> 01:21:17,220
I'm...

1548
01:21:19,048 --> 01:21:20,484
falling in love with Harper.

1549
01:21:20,614 --> 01:21:22,921
Oh! Harper's fantastic.

1550
01:21:23,052 --> 01:21:25,030
I've been trying to get her
to open herself up to dating

1551
01:21:25,054 --> 01:21:26,490
for so long.

1552
01:21:26,620 --> 01:21:28,622
You two would be adorbs.

1553
01:21:28,753 --> 01:21:30,537
And he's actually
double in love with her,

1554
01:21:30,668 --> 01:21:33,323
first as Miss Santa #1,
and now in real life.

1555
01:21:33,453 --> 01:21:35,891
Great point, Elliott.

1556
01:21:37,980 --> 01:21:39,895
So, what happens now?

1557
01:21:40,765 --> 01:21:41,766
Nothing.

1558
01:21:42,854 --> 01:21:44,900
She doesn't feel the same way.

1559
01:21:46,597 --> 01:21:49,077
She went to the end of the earth
to keep me from finding out...

1560
01:21:50,166 --> 01:21:52,603
she was the person
I was actually looking for.

1561
01:21:52,733 --> 01:21:55,214
Well, do you think she knows
how you feel about her?

1562
01:21:55,345 --> 01:21:57,236
What about the republication,
how did that go over?

1563
01:21:57,260 --> 01:21:59,175
It hasn't yet,
I haven't had ti...

1564
01:22:04,136 --> 01:22:05,136
I've gotta go.

1565
01:22:05,181 --> 01:22:06,922
Um, thank you both.

1566
01:22:08,010 --> 01:22:10,926
Elliott, you stay.

1567
01:22:12,101 --> 01:22:13,101
Yeah.

1568
01:22:13,189 --> 01:22:15,147
Dinner's on me.

1569
01:22:15,278 --> 01:22:17,628
- Uh...
- Okay you kids, gotta go.

1570
01:22:18,629 --> 01:22:20,152
Good luck! Merry Christmas!

1571
01:22:23,721 --> 01:22:25,636
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1572
01:22:30,684 --> 01:22:31,859
Hey.

1573
01:22:31,990 --> 01:22:33,470
Hey.

1574
01:22:35,254 --> 01:22:36,777
Sylvia's wonderful, Derrick.

1575
01:22:36,908 --> 01:22:39,389
I'm partial to her myself.

1576
01:22:40,651 --> 01:22:42,392
How are things going
with Santa Claus?

1577
01:22:44,350 --> 01:22:46,309
It didn't work out.

1578
01:22:46,439 --> 01:22:49,312
And I think it's for the better.

1579
01:22:51,749 --> 01:22:55,666
So, uh, I'm to assume
that you headed it off.

1580
01:22:56,797 --> 01:22:58,364
And I guess it's safe to assume

1581
01:22:58,495 --> 01:23:00,845
that Dani's at least
part of your excuse?

1582
01:23:03,674 --> 01:23:06,068
Because the thing
about Dani is...

1583
01:23:06,198 --> 01:23:07,591
she's growing up.

1584
01:23:09,158 --> 01:23:11,334
She's getting wiser,
more perceptive.

1585
01:23:11,464 --> 01:23:12,813
Listen, at some point,

1586
01:23:12,944 --> 01:23:14,946
it will be less about
protecting her and more about

1587
01:23:15,077 --> 01:23:16,948
setting a good example.

1588
01:23:17,079 --> 01:23:19,516
Hey, remember that big fight
we got into in college?

1589
01:23:19,646 --> 01:23:21,822
And that big gesture
that I made,

1590
01:23:21,953 --> 01:23:24,129
singing to you from your window
of our biology class,

1591
01:23:24,260 --> 01:23:25,826
remember that?
Yes.

1592
01:23:25,957 --> 01:23:27,872
Right.
Well, I've been outdone.

1593
01:23:29,656 --> 01:23:31,049
Santa Claus posted something

1594
01:23:31,180 --> 01:23:32,740
that I think you might
be interested in.

1595
01:23:34,879 --> 01:23:36,228
Press play.

1596
01:23:36,359 --> 01:23:38,187
Yeah.

1597
01:23:38,317 --> 01:23:40,885
<i>I'd say it's less
of a business venture</i>

1598
01:23:41,016 --> 01:23:44,236
<i>and more of a gift to someone
very important to me.</i>

1599
01:23:45,716 --> 01:23:47,892
Because Northbound Elf
is very special to her too.

1600
01:23:49,589 --> 01:23:52,331
<i>It's a book about finding home
where you least suspect it.</i>

1601
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:54,899
<i>And I found home with her.</i>

1602
01:23:59,121 --> 01:24:00,383
Oh...

1603
01:24:01,775 --> 01:24:03,777
I... I've gotta go.

1604
01:24:10,784 --> 01:24:12,134
Hi.

1605
01:24:12,264 --> 01:24:13,744
Hey.

1606
01:24:15,833 --> 01:24:18,923
Is this for Zoey?

1607
01:24:20,272 --> 01:24:24,755
No, actually,
it's for Miss Santa #1.

1608
01:24:26,365 --> 01:24:29,977
Thought it would remind her
of her favourite part

1609
01:24:30,108 --> 01:24:32,067
of her favourite book.

1610
01:24:36,419 --> 01:24:37,768
It is.

1611
01:24:39,117 --> 01:24:41,250
I'm sorry that
it's not fully wrapped,

1612
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:43,730
I ran out of wrapping paper
and my favourite paper store

1613
01:24:43,861 --> 01:24:45,428
was closed early today.

1614
01:24:47,038 --> 01:24:49,954
I just saw your post.

1615
01:24:50,085 --> 01:24:52,348
It was...

1616
01:24:52,478 --> 01:24:54,219
I was inspired.

1617
01:24:58,223 --> 01:25:01,444
I need you to know that
I was not after Six Degrees.

1618
01:25:01,574 --> 01:25:04,534
I wanted to secure a copyright
but I wanted to do it for you,

1619
01:25:04,664 --> 01:25:06,449
to protect your idea.

1620
01:25:06,579 --> 01:25:08,103
And...

1621
01:25:09,930 --> 01:25:13,238
I also included a prototype.

1622
01:25:13,369 --> 01:25:15,849
You can think of it as
a type of scaffolding.

1623
01:25:15,980 --> 01:25:19,288
And you can go in there,
and play around,

1624
01:25:19,418 --> 01:25:21,159
and change things if you want.

1625
01:25:21,290 --> 01:25:23,509
Or nothing at all,
it's up to you.

1626
01:25:23,640 --> 01:25:25,207
But, um...

1627
01:25:25,337 --> 01:25:28,645
I was just hoping
that we could be partners.

1628
01:25:32,475 --> 01:25:34,259
I...

1629
01:25:34,390 --> 01:25:37,567
I think you were right
about opening up Six Degrees

1630
01:25:38,655 --> 01:25:40,657
and...

1631
01:25:40,787 --> 01:25:42,659
I want to do that with you.

1632
01:25:44,226 --> 01:25:47,359
I thought I was protecting it,
but I was actually

1633
01:25:47,490 --> 01:25:50,101
holding it back
from so much potential.

1634
01:25:51,276 --> 01:25:53,409
I think the same
might go for my heart.

1635
01:25:55,019 --> 01:25:58,327
I'm sorry I didn't tell you
that I was Santa #1.

1636
01:25:58,457 --> 01:26:00,067
At first I thought you were

1637
01:26:00,198 --> 01:26:01,598
the last person
in the world for me,

1638
01:26:01,721 --> 01:26:03,177
and then that became
less and less the case

1639
01:26:03,201 --> 01:26:04,855
until...

1640
01:26:04,985 --> 01:26:06,683
you were the only one for me.

1641
01:26:25,876 --> 01:26:27,356
I think this is another
great argument

1642
01:26:27,486 --> 01:26:29,053
for opening up Six Degrees.

1643
01:26:30,576 --> 01:26:33,231
I think you might be
right about that, partner.
