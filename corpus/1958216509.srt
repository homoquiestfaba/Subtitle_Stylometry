1
00:02:18,138 --> 00:02:20,576
Emma.

2
00:02:21,375 --> 00:02:24,245
Wake up, Emma.

3
00:02:25,245 --> 00:02:28,249
Emma. Wake up.

4
00:02:29,517 --> 00:02:30,816
Momma?

5
00:02:30,818 --> 00:02:32,555
Yeah. Shhh.

6
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:34,920
We're going to go
chase the sunrise, ok?

7
00:02:34,922 --> 00:02:36,055
Ok.

8
00:02:36,057 --> 00:02:37,489
But you have to be quiet.

9
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:39,157
Come on, sweetie. Up, up.

10
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:40,126
Give me your feet.

11
00:02:40,128 --> 00:02:41,192
Give me your feet.

12
00:02:41,194 --> 00:02:42,193
There you go.

13
00:02:42,195 --> 00:02:43,495
Good girl.

14
00:02:43,497 --> 00:02:44,667
Go grab your backpack.

15
00:02:47,935 --> 00:02:49,237
Come here. Come here. Come here.

16
00:02:49,403 --> 00:02:50,573
Put your backpack on.

17
00:02:51,773 --> 00:02:53,204
Don't forget your
rhino. Ok sweetie?

18
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:54,677
Come on.

19
00:03:03,017 --> 00:03:04,050
Ok.

20
00:03:04,052 --> 00:03:05,350
Come on up.

21
00:03:05,352 --> 00:03:06,919
Here we go.

22
00:03:06,921 --> 00:03:08,289
Take off your backpack.

23
00:03:08,856 --> 00:03:10,326
Keep your rhino.

24
00:03:22,704 --> 00:03:24,540
Where's Daddy?

25
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:27,343
It's ok, love.

26
00:03:27,575 --> 00:03:28,941
It's just a girls trip, ok?

27
00:03:28,943 --> 00:03:30,442
Ok.

28
00:03:30,444 --> 00:03:31,911
You want to see
the countryside, right?

29
00:03:31,913 --> 00:03:33,112
Where Mommy grew up?

30
00:03:33,114 --> 00:03:35,016
It's going to be great.

31
00:03:35,248 --> 00:03:36,752
It's going to be
really really great.

32
00:04:17,024 --> 00:04:18,360
Alex, don't!

33
00:04:18,826 --> 00:04:20,663
Give me the keys!

34
00:04:26,234 --> 00:04:27,570
Come here, bug.

35
00:04:27,802 --> 00:04:28,804
Come here.

36
00:04:29,537 --> 00:04:31,674
Let's get you back inside
and give Mommy a moment.

37
00:04:47,622 --> 00:04:50,191
Shhh. You have to be quiet.

38
00:04:50,390 --> 00:04:52,328
Why? What is it?

39
00:04:53,895 --> 00:04:56,097
We're in the night forest
where it's always nighttime.

40
00:04:56,831 --> 00:04:58,801
And when it's nighttime
all the bad feelings come out.

41
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:01,567
Brrr. I feel cold.

42
00:05:01,569 --> 00:05:03,368
Maybe I should sing
a song to keep us warm.

43
00:05:03,370 --> 00:05:05,436
No. Shhh. Don't.

44
00:05:05,438 --> 00:05:07,039
The bad feelings will hear you.

45
00:05:07,041 --> 00:05:08,410
They're everywhere.

46
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:11,277
Quick, we gotta make it
back to the castle before...

47
00:05:11,279 --> 00:05:13,145
Ha ha ha!

48
00:05:13,147 --> 00:05:15,346
Oh no! The Mud Witch!

49
00:05:15,348 --> 00:05:17,448
I can grow anywhere!

50
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,121
My dress is the ground!

51
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:21,720
What were you thinking?

52
00:05:21,722 --> 00:05:22,955
Stop.

53
00:05:22,957 --> 00:05:24,422
Just stop.

54
00:05:24,424 --> 00:05:25,828
What? And leave you alone?

55
00:05:27,161 --> 00:05:29,394
Leave you alone so you can grab
up everything and yank it out of
my life?

56
00:05:29,396 --> 00:05:30,866
Oh, like you care.

57
00:05:31,833 --> 00:05:33,364
All you care about is
your writing and your career.

58
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:35,433
Forest fairies, eat this dress!

59
00:05:35,435 --> 00:05:36,635
Yum, yum, yum!

60
00:05:36,637 --> 00:05:38,103
Are there any bugs in it?

61
00:05:38,105 --> 00:05:39,370
Lots!

62
00:05:39,372 --> 00:05:40,743
Delicious!

63
00:05:40,775 --> 00:05:43,876
Every time I have a deadline...

64
00:05:43,878 --> 00:05:47,449
Every time I have a hard burn
you pull something like this.

65
00:05:48,415 --> 00:05:50,082
You don't see anything
I do around here?

66
00:05:50,084 --> 00:05:52,084
Stop making this about you.

67
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:53,418
About me?

68
00:05:53,420 --> 00:05:55,491
About me?!

69
00:05:59,459 --> 00:06:01,563
You were gonna take Emma.

70
00:06:03,865 --> 00:06:05,299
Emma, sweetie.

71
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:07,369
I thought you were playing.

72
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:11,373
You know you shouldn't
be playing on the stairs.

73
00:06:11,772 --> 00:06:13,876
But I needed space
for the night forest.

74
00:06:15,408 --> 00:06:16,609
Come on.

75
00:06:16,611 --> 00:06:18,313
Let's get you back to bed.

76
00:06:18,846 --> 00:06:20,181
Here we go.

77
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:23,249
Why was Mommy crying?

78
00:06:23,251 --> 00:06:24,586
I don't know, bug.

79
00:06:25,152 --> 00:06:26,588
It's complicated.

80
00:06:26,888 --> 00:06:29,223
Your mother is a
complicated woman.

81
00:06:29,489 --> 00:06:31,192
And she has her moments.

82
00:06:31,225 --> 00:06:33,595
And you have to yell at her?

83
00:06:37,131 --> 00:06:38,333
I shouldn't have yelled.

84
00:06:39,100 --> 00:06:41,235
But yelling isn't the only thing
that makes things mean.

85
00:06:42,503 --> 00:06:44,205
The important thing is
that we work through it.

86
00:06:44,338 --> 00:06:45,938
We clean up the mess.

87
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:47,241
That's right.

88
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:49,440
Family is work...

89
00:06:49,442 --> 00:06:50,813
Just like anything.

90
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,716
Maybe we should
get Mommy flowers.

91
00:06:55,149 --> 00:06:56,649
Maybe we should get Mommy...

92
00:06:56,651 --> 00:06:58,520
Like, a purple flower, or...

93
00:06:58,819 --> 00:07:00,723
Some color she
hasn't seen like...

94
00:07:01,155 --> 00:07:03,622
A rainbow flower or
a unicorn flower.

95
00:07:03,624 --> 00:07:05,224
You see colors like that?

96
00:07:05,226 --> 00:07:07,293
When I dream sometimes.

97
00:07:07,295 --> 00:07:08,530
Wish I could dream like that.

98
00:07:09,630 --> 00:07:11,397
It'd make writing my book
a heck of a lot easier.

99
00:07:11,399 --> 00:07:12,731
Tell you what...

100
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:14,536
Tomorrow, when you're
done dreaming...

101
00:07:15,036 --> 00:07:17,870
We'll go and we'll see what
we can do for Mommy, ok?

102
00:07:17,872 --> 00:07:19,341
Ok.

103
00:07:24,745 --> 00:07:26,749
I love you, Daddy.

104
00:07:30,952 --> 00:07:32,554
Love you too.

105
00:07:32,620 --> 00:07:34,389
Goodnight, bug,

106
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:41,897
I'll be on the couch.

107
00:07:42,897 --> 00:07:44,967
You do whatever you want to do.

108
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:02,885
The moon is big.

109
00:08:04,285 --> 00:08:05,721
That's a full moon.

110
00:08:05,987 --> 00:08:07,689
It doesn't happen every night.

111
00:08:07,788 --> 00:08:10,025
I wish I could go there.

112
00:08:10,424 --> 00:08:11,894
You can.

113
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:14,960
I could take one of the clouds.

114
00:08:14,962 --> 00:08:15,861
Yeah.

115
00:08:15,863 --> 00:08:18,330
But clouds drift so...

116
00:08:18,332 --> 00:08:20,966
You need a way to make them go
where you want them to go.

117
00:08:20,968 --> 00:08:22,568
Now...

118
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:24,606
Close your eyes, love.

119
00:08:24,972 --> 00:08:26,742
Close your eyes.

120
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:29,344
And float far away.

121
00:08:39,587 --> 00:08:44,026
No, I can't forget this evening.

122
00:08:45,126 --> 00:08:49,331
Or your face as
you were leaving.

123
00:08:50,031 --> 00:08:56,371
But I guess that's just
the way the story goes.

124
00:08:58,239 --> 00:09:05,848
You always smile but in
your eyes your sorrow shows.

125
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:12,487
Yes, it shows.

126
00:09:15,056 --> 00:09:16,592
Night, beauty.

127
00:10:28,796 --> 00:10:30,295
I'm done now, Alex. I'm done!

128
00:10:30,297 --> 00:10:32,167
Nice. Real nice, Sara.

129
00:10:32,266 --> 00:10:33,533
You scream and you yell.

130
00:10:33,535 --> 00:10:35,568
You poor victim!

131
00:10:35,570 --> 00:10:36,536
You treat me like garbage
in front of our own daughter!

132
00:10:36,538 --> 00:10:38,370
You push and you push...

133
00:10:38,372 --> 00:10:40,739
And I shove back and
then I'm the problem?!

134
00:10:40,741 --> 00:10:42,241
You're the one who wants
to destroy this house.

135
00:10:42,243 --> 00:10:44,577
I just want out!

136
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:45,477
You want out?

137
00:10:45,479 --> 00:10:46,181
All right.

138
00:10:46,548 --> 00:10:47,479
Fine! You want out?

139
00:10:47,481 --> 00:10:49,381
Say goodbye to the credit cards!

140
00:10:49,383 --> 00:10:50,782
Good mooch off your parents
and see how far you go!

141
00:10:50,784 --> 00:10:52,487
Sorry I'm such a burden to you!

142
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:54,887
Sara, with everything
I've got going on...

143
00:10:54,889 --> 00:10:56,623
I cannot be responsible
for your feelings.

144
00:10:56,625 --> 00:10:58,123
Stop saying that!

145
00:10:58,125 --> 00:10:59,758
Then do something for yourself!

146
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:02,728
I just want you to listen!

147
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:03,829
Stop!

148
00:11:03,831 --> 00:11:05,767
No, stop!

149
00:11:07,768 --> 00:11:08,967
Emma, sweetie.

150
00:11:08,969 --> 00:11:11,073
No, I'm never going to
talk to you ever again!

151
00:12:47,101 --> 00:12:49,468
Dispatch 17-24 to
Ambulance 12-49...

152
00:12:49,470 --> 00:12:50,672
What's your status?

153
00:12:50,938 --> 00:12:52,974
Ambulance 12-49 to Dispatch...

154
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:54,273
We've arrived at
the residence...

155
00:12:54,275 --> 00:12:56,609
Confirming Y92.

156
00:12:56,611 --> 00:12:59,712
One female girl, five years old,
breathing but unresponsive.

157
00:12:59,714 --> 00:13:00,713
Possible head trauma.

158
00:13:00,715 --> 00:13:01,983
Both parents on scene.

159
00:13:02,049 --> 00:13:04,883
Call number 16-0-7-5.

160
00:13:04,885 --> 00:13:07,452
17-24 Dispatcher to
Ambulance 4 and medic...

161
00:13:07,454 --> 00:13:08,690
Engine 2 to scene.

162
00:13:08,822 --> 00:13:11,626
Call number 16-0-7-5.

163
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,673
Dispatch 17-24 to
Ambulance 12-49...

164
00:13:59,406 --> 00:14:00,809
What's the chief complaint
and situation?

165
00:14:01,743 --> 00:14:03,745
MS 12-49 to Dispatch...

166
00:14:03,778 --> 00:14:04,980
Proceeding with medical.

167
00:14:06,013 --> 00:14:07,649
Administering I.V. for
adrenaline boost.

168
00:15:54,288 --> 00:15:56,758
What did we do to our baby?

169
00:15:57,692 --> 00:15:59,961
What did we do to our baby?

170
00:16:04,799 --> 00:16:07,199
Oh god.

171
00:16:07,201 --> 00:16:08,601
It's ok, baby.

172
00:16:08,603 --> 00:16:10,171
It's ok.

173
00:16:15,976 --> 00:16:17,209
She's going to be okay.

174
00:16:17,211 --> 00:16:19,114
Is she going to be ok?

175
00:16:19,514 --> 00:16:20,746
No, no...

176
00:16:20,748 --> 00:16:22,518
One, two, three.

177
00:16:23,585 --> 00:16:23,950
Can you please be
careful with her?

178
00:16:23,952 --> 00:16:24,717
Sarah.

179
00:16:24,719 --> 00:16:26,084
Can you...

180
00:16:26,086 --> 00:16:27,720
We just need to stabilize her
neck in case there's any damage.

181
00:16:27,722 --> 00:16:28,888
She could be bleeding.

182
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,393
Please, Ma'am, stay back.

183
00:16:31,659 --> 00:16:33,028
No, no, no.

184
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:33,559
Please don't tie her down!

185
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:34,192
Sara!

186
00:16:34,194 --> 00:16:34,927
Please don't tie her down!

187
00:16:34,929 --> 00:16:35,895
Do not!

188
00:16:35,897 --> 00:16:37,899
Alex! Can you tell them!

189
00:16:37,998 --> 00:16:39,832
Mommy! Daddy! I'm here!

190
00:16:39,834 --> 00:16:41,466
Stop it, Alex! Stop it!

191
00:16:41,468 --> 00:16:42,635
Daddy!

192
00:16:42,637 --> 00:16:43,769
I'm here!

193
00:16:43,771 --> 00:16:44,904
I'm here. Mommy!

194
00:16:44,906 --> 00:16:45,470
Listen to me...

195
00:16:45,472 --> 00:16:46,342
Sara!

196
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:48,009
This is my baby! Stop!

197
00:16:48,676 --> 00:16:49,775
Mommy!

198
00:16:49,777 --> 00:16:51,447
Let them do their job, baby.

199
00:16:51,746 --> 00:16:54,215
Let them do their job, ok?

200
00:16:55,082 --> 00:16:56,519
Mommy.

201
00:16:56,951 --> 00:16:58,421
Don't cry.

202
00:16:58,620 --> 00:16:59,986
Can you put her on
her side please.

203
00:16:59,988 --> 00:17:01,453
I'm right here, Mommy.

204
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:03,455
She likes to sleep on her side.

205
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:05,960
Can you put her on
her side please?

206
00:17:07,361 --> 00:17:10,333
Alex, please tell them she
likes to sleep on her side.

207
00:17:11,866 --> 00:17:14,936
No!

208
00:17:16,704 --> 00:17:18,341
What did we do?

209
00:17:19,007 --> 00:17:21,843
Emma!

210
00:19:29,169 --> 00:19:31,674
Hello?

211
00:19:32,372 --> 00:19:35,176
Is anyone there?

212
00:22:54,008 --> 00:22:54,810
Hey!

213
00:22:55,009 --> 00:22:55,741
You're ok! You're ok!

214
00:22:55,743 --> 00:22:57,176
Hey!

215
00:22:57,178 --> 00:22:58,614
Momma.

216
00:22:58,946 --> 00:23:00,613
There was something
in the water.

217
00:23:00,615 --> 00:23:02,447
Something got my leg!

218
00:23:02,449 --> 00:23:04,617
Everything's ok.
I'm right here, ok?

219
00:23:04,619 --> 00:23:05,751
Nothing got your leg.

220
00:23:05,753 --> 00:23:07,887
You're trying to stand up, bug.

221
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:09,425
Did you feel yourself
trying to stand up?

222
00:23:09,991 --> 00:23:11,192
What I want you to do...

223
00:23:11,726 --> 00:23:12,725
I want you to kick
your feet, alright?

224
00:23:12,727 --> 00:23:14,059
Ok.

225
00:23:14,061 --> 00:23:15,194
I want you to kick your feet
through the water, alright?

226
00:23:15,196 --> 00:23:16,862
Pick your feet up.

227
00:23:16,864 --> 00:23:18,400
Now kick yourself
through the water. Ready?

228
00:23:18,833 --> 00:23:20,602
Kick your feet. Kick your feet!

229
00:23:21,068 --> 00:23:22,167
Now move your arms.
Move your arms too!

230
00:23:22,169 --> 00:23:23,505
Move your arms!

231
00:23:24,005 --> 00:23:25,307
There you go!

232
00:23:25,373 --> 00:23:27,543
Yes!

233
00:23:28,009 --> 00:23:28,911
Keep going!

234
00:23:29,476 --> 00:23:30,609
There you go. You're
doing it, Emma!

235
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:32,548
Look at that!

236
00:23:33,314 --> 00:23:35,047
What? What are you doing?

237
00:23:35,049 --> 00:23:37,319
You're doing it!
Doing like a champ!

238
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,218
- Daddy! Come watch me!
- Wow!

239
00:23:39,220 --> 00:23:40,451
Look at you, bug!

240
00:23:40,453 --> 00:23:41,186
You swimming on your own?

241
00:23:41,188 --> 00:23:41,957
Yeah!

242
00:23:42,223 --> 00:23:43,088
Are you holding on to her?

243
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,426
Not anymore.

244
00:23:45,226 --> 00:23:46,625
There you go, buddy.

245
00:23:46,627 --> 00:23:47,192
Want to go to Daddy?

246
00:23:47,194 --> 00:23:47,760
Yeah.

247
00:23:47,762 --> 00:23:48,227
Ok.

248
00:23:48,229 --> 00:23:49,665
Ready?

249
00:23:49,764 --> 00:23:51,196
Set!

250
00:23:51,198 --> 00:23:52,768
Don't forget to kick your feet.

251
00:23:52,867 --> 00:23:54,336
Go!

252
00:23:57,371 --> 00:24:03,244
Don't forget to kick your feet.

253
00:26:52,213 --> 00:26:53,749
Emma?

254
00:26:55,483 --> 00:26:57,019
Emma?

255
00:26:57,885 --> 00:26:59,121
Hey little beauty.

256
00:27:01,655 --> 00:27:03,125
It's ok.

257
00:27:03,224 --> 00:27:04,826
Mommy's here.

258
00:27:19,940 --> 00:27:22,044
Wherever you are, Emma.

259
00:27:23,711 --> 00:27:25,180
Be strong.

260
00:27:25,580 --> 00:27:26,949
Be brave.

261
00:27:28,649 --> 00:27:31,887
It's gonna be okay.

262
00:27:35,590 --> 00:27:39,861
Well, I can't forget
this evening...

263
00:27:40,694 --> 00:27:44,166
And your face when
you were leaving...

264
00:27:45,032 --> 00:27:50,872
But I guess that's just
the way the story goes.

265
00:27:53,107 --> 00:28:00,115
You always smile but in
your eyes your sorrow shows.

266
00:28:01,482 --> 00:28:04,086
Yes, it shows.

267
00:28:10,391 --> 00:28:13,495
I can't live...

268
00:28:14,695 --> 00:28:18,233
If living is without you.

269
00:28:18,299 --> 00:28:21,903
I can't live...

270
00:28:22,637 --> 00:28:26,905
I can't give anymore.

271
00:28:26,907 --> 00:28:30,812
I can't live...

272
00:28:31,613 --> 00:28:35,480
If living is without you.

273
00:28:35,482 --> 00:28:39,154
I can't live...

274
00:28:39,887 --> 00:28:45,127
I can't give anymore.

275
00:28:55,869 --> 00:28:57,172
Thank you, little girl.

276
00:28:57,338 --> 00:28:58,804
Again, again!

277
00:28:58,806 --> 00:29:01,143
I'm afraid you'll have to wait.

278
00:29:04,478 --> 00:29:06,478
Is it broken?

279
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,750
I'm afraid so.

280
00:29:09,850 --> 00:29:11,853
Everything can't
work all the time.

281
00:29:16,123 --> 00:29:17,793
I wish I was home right now.

282
00:29:17,925 --> 00:29:20,662
My Mommy's so sad I'm not there.

283
00:29:21,095 --> 00:29:22,998
Are you lost, little girl?

284
00:29:24,666 --> 00:29:26,068
I'm sorry to hear that.

285
00:29:27,067 --> 00:29:29,305
Can we call them?

286
00:29:30,237 --> 00:29:32,574
No, we can't call them here.

287
00:29:33,207 --> 00:29:35,977
But I do know where you can.

288
00:29:36,844 --> 00:29:39,315
But it's far away and high up.

289
00:29:40,715 --> 00:29:42,984
How will I know
where to find it?

290
00:29:53,728 --> 00:29:57,299
If you listen just right...

291
00:29:57,599 --> 00:29:59,201
You'll hear the signal.

292
00:29:59,867 --> 00:30:01,803
You'll know it.

293
00:30:03,738 --> 00:30:05,941
If you ever get lost...

294
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:08,944
Consider the future...

295
00:30:09,009 --> 00:30:12,147
Imagine how you get there.

296
00:30:12,747 --> 00:30:14,116
Thank you.

297
00:30:16,283 --> 00:30:17,719
Uh oh.

298
00:30:19,420 --> 00:30:20,755
You woke it up.

299
00:30:20,888 --> 00:30:21,788
You better run, little girl.

300
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:23,625
Go. Now.

301
00:30:23,891 --> 00:30:25,760
Let me see how fast you can run.

302
00:30:35,402 --> 00:30:37,340
You sit up so straight
when I read to you

303
00:31:18,513 --> 00:31:20,713
stuffed animals and
some of your toys

304
00:31:20,715 --> 00:31:22,784
all kinds of things from home...

305
00:31:49,076 --> 00:31:50,745
I am so sorry...

306
00:31:55,949 --> 00:31:58,253
Daddy, he's been
working here too

307
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:02,358
working so hard for us...

308
00:32:03,625 --> 00:32:05,126
I love you, sweetie.

309
00:32:53,273 --> 00:32:55,240
This way! Straight! Straight!

310
00:32:55,242 --> 00:32:56,911
Alright. Straight, alright.

311
00:32:58,278 --> 00:32:59,912
- Which way am I going?
- This way! This way!

312
00:32:59,914 --> 00:33:00,913
Why would I go
over to the wall?!

313
00:33:00,915 --> 00:33:03,649
Oh, my nose! My nose!

314
00:33:03,651 --> 00:33:05,116
Left, left, left!

315
00:33:05,118 --> 00:33:05,918
You're guiding me
into the walls.

316
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:06,719
This way.

317
00:33:06,721 --> 00:33:08,391
Alright, here we go.

318
00:33:08,957 --> 00:33:10,288
Hop up here.

319
00:33:10,290 --> 00:33:12,428
Oh, you silly goose.

320
00:33:12,627 --> 00:33:14,195
You're a silly goose!

321
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:17,195
It's so dark in here.

322
00:33:17,197 --> 00:33:19,397
Yeah, we're using
a lot of power.

323
00:33:19,399 --> 00:33:20,967
Just getting used to what we
can do with the new house.

324
00:33:20,969 --> 00:33:22,969
Does the house need batteries?

325
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:24,806
The house doesn't use batteries.

326
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:27,008
It has its own power
it draws from the city.

327
00:33:27,074 --> 00:33:28,444
Electrical power.

328
00:33:29,076 --> 00:33:30,446
Like lightning.

329
00:33:35,650 --> 00:33:37,152
That kind of power.

330
00:33:37,685 --> 00:33:39,355
Sara?!

331
00:33:40,020 --> 00:33:42,057
That do anything?!

332
00:33:46,326 --> 00:33:49,130
The walls are scratching.

333
00:33:58,138 --> 00:34:00,238
The walls are scratching.

334
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,243
Maybe it's a spider.

335
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,447
Or maybe it's...

336
00:34:04,512 --> 00:34:06,247
Grandpa's teeth.

337
00:34:07,447 --> 00:34:09,381
And they're trapped
in the wall...

338
00:34:09,383 --> 00:34:11,086
And they're chattering around
until we come find them.

339
00:34:14,889 --> 00:34:17,859
It's probably just a
squirrel or a raccoon.

340
00:34:18,660 --> 00:34:20,258
Yeah, it got trapped in there
whenever the house was empty.

341
00:34:20,260 --> 00:34:21,727
Can we fix it?

342
00:34:21,729 --> 00:34:22,795
Sure.

343
00:34:22,797 --> 00:34:24,165
Of course.

344
00:34:25,033 --> 00:34:27,969
Every problem has a solution.

345
00:34:28,636 --> 00:34:30,071
Voila.

346
00:34:41,181 --> 00:34:43,386
I brought you some things.

347
00:34:44,018 --> 00:34:45,987
Just toys and a few books.

348
00:34:47,689 --> 00:34:49,924
I know you probably feel like
you're in some far off place.

349
00:34:50,457 --> 00:34:52,093
But I want you to
feel like you're home.

350
00:34:53,528 --> 00:34:55,498
The doctor said it's good
for us to talk to you.

351
00:34:56,064 --> 00:34:58,233
For you to hear our voices.

352
00:34:58,967 --> 00:35:01,102
I remember when you
were just a little thing.

353
00:35:02,036 --> 00:35:03,439
And I would wonder
how you saw me.

354
00:35:07,008 --> 00:35:09,412
A blurry shapeless thing?

355
00:35:09,777 --> 00:35:12,113
Was I a darkness?

356
00:35:12,647 --> 00:35:14,617
I always tried to
do the right thing.

357
00:35:15,215 --> 00:35:18,219
For you and for your mom.

358
00:35:18,886 --> 00:35:21,323
Every day I tried
to take care of her.

359
00:35:21,823 --> 00:35:23,526
But it's all such a mess.

360
00:35:26,460 --> 00:35:28,631
You have this idea
of yourself...

361
00:35:29,564 --> 00:35:32,133
I'm never going to make
it to you like this, Daddy.

362
00:35:32,466 --> 00:35:34,132
How things are
going to turn out.

363
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:35,638
And then you grow up...

364
00:35:36,838 --> 00:35:38,940
And you look around
and everything is different.

365
00:35:41,943 --> 00:35:46,080
I loved that it was
just me, you and Mom.

366
00:35:47,882 --> 00:35:49,749
Maybe I never showed
it the right way.

367
00:35:49,751 --> 00:35:52,354
Maybe I wasn't around as
much as I could have been.

368
00:35:54,956 --> 00:35:57,660
You brought nothing
but beauty into my life.

369
00:36:01,328 --> 00:36:02,665
You were all the good things.

370
00:36:03,631 --> 00:36:07,302
You are all the good things.

371
00:37:38,960 --> 00:37:40,462
Life doesn't stop.

372
00:37:40,862 --> 00:37:42,163
Bills don't stop.

373
00:37:43,865 --> 00:37:45,668
I don't know our insurance
is going to...

374
00:37:58,311 --> 00:37:59,745
I'm on my way, Daddy!

375
00:37:59,747 --> 00:38:01,282
Left! Left!

376
00:38:19,366 --> 00:38:21,704
Now we're moving!

377
00:38:56,704 --> 00:38:58,139
Mommy?

378
00:38:59,406 --> 00:39:00,743
Hey sweetie.

379
00:39:01,441 --> 00:39:03,445
What are you doing?

380
00:39:04,011 --> 00:39:06,147
I'm celebrating.

381
00:39:06,547 --> 00:39:08,384
It's my birthday today.

382
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:11,285
I didn't know it
was your birthday.

383
00:39:12,385 --> 00:39:15,156
You're losing all
of your balloons.

384
00:39:15,556 --> 00:39:17,459
I'm just watching
them dance, sweetie.

385
00:39:18,125 --> 00:39:19,561
You know when I was your age...

386
00:39:19,694 --> 00:39:21,697
I couldn't wait for my birthday.

387
00:39:22,395 --> 00:39:24,400
I looked forward
to it every year.

388
00:39:27,467 --> 00:39:29,405
Grandpa would set
up the barbecue and...

389
00:39:30,403 --> 00:39:33,308
Grandma would dress
the entire yard.

390
00:39:33,941 --> 00:39:36,277
Tables with glitter,
ribbons and balloons...

391
00:39:36,711 --> 00:39:39,381
And the backyard would
just go and go and go.

392
00:39:39,714 --> 00:39:41,684
We didn't even need shoes.

393
00:39:42,550 --> 00:39:44,720
We just let the
grass clean our feet.

394
00:39:47,420 --> 00:39:50,793
You want to go get some cake
and blow out candles for wishes?

395
00:39:50,825 --> 00:39:52,358
You know what I wish for, love?

396
00:39:52,360 --> 00:39:53,796
What?

397
00:39:54,295 --> 00:39:56,230
I wish you could
have what I had.

398
00:39:56,964 --> 00:39:58,801
What did you have?

399
00:39:59,166 --> 00:40:01,202
The fields and the woods
and the open air.

400
00:40:02,703 --> 00:40:04,703
You want to go somewhere?

401
00:40:04,705 --> 00:40:06,341
It's okay, sweetie.

402
00:40:06,674 --> 00:40:08,544
There's nowhere to go anyway.

403
00:40:09,176 --> 00:40:10,746
Made you some tea.

404
00:40:11,879 --> 00:40:13,549
The tea always tastes funny
when you make it.

405
00:40:13,881 --> 00:40:15,918
I can't even boil water right.

406
00:40:16,150 --> 00:40:17,519
It's not about that.

407
00:40:17,785 --> 00:40:19,722
It's about the right
amount of honey.

408
00:40:20,721 --> 00:40:22,858
Mine tastes good because
it's made with love.

409
00:40:23,591 --> 00:40:25,324
Yours tastes like
you're just doing it.

410
00:40:25,326 --> 00:40:27,793
So you can get back to
whatever it is you care about.

411
00:40:27,795 --> 00:40:29,732
I didn't create a deadline
to annoy you, Sara.

412
00:40:30,998 --> 00:40:33,335
No, you do your job,
and I'll do mine.

413
00:40:34,501 --> 00:40:36,338
Hey bug.

414
00:40:39,472 --> 00:40:41,543
Take really good
care of Mommy, ok?

415
00:41:38,799 --> 00:41:40,836
And in those eyes...

416
00:41:41,335 --> 00:41:43,338
I'd see all the things you'd do.

417
00:41:46,107 --> 00:41:50,012
I figured you'd either be a
rockstar or marry a rockstar.

418
00:41:51,612 --> 00:41:53,448
Bring some dirtbag home...

419
00:41:54,648 --> 00:41:56,718
And I'd have to put up with him.

420
00:41:57,318 --> 00:42:00,455
Watch him stomp his muddy boots
all over the place.

421
00:42:01,889 --> 00:42:04,660
That stuff seems so far away.

422
00:42:21,909 --> 00:42:23,445
Hello.

423
00:42:27,314 --> 00:42:30,552
It's so dark in here.

424
00:44:05,779 --> 00:44:07,549
Can you play some
music, little lady?

425
00:47:09,698 --> 00:47:12,335
I thought I knew you.

426
00:47:18,839 --> 00:47:20,742
You're the new maid.

427
00:47:35,422 --> 00:47:37,192
You'll have to
clean up the mess.

428
00:47:51,939 --> 00:47:53,972
Scrub-a-dub dub.

429
00:47:53,974 --> 00:47:56,811
Scrub, scrub, scrub, dub.

430
00:47:59,681 --> 00:48:01,783
Scrub-a-dub dub.

431
00:48:02,049 --> 00:48:03,415
Scrub, scrub, scrub,
scrub, scrub...

432
00:48:03,417 --> 00:48:04,817
Scrub, scrub, scrub,
scrub, scrub...

433
00:48:04,819 --> 00:48:06,288
Scrub, scrub, scrub...

434
00:48:06,554 --> 00:48:07,989
Scrub, scrub, scrub,
scrub, scrub...

435
00:48:08,222 --> 00:48:09,221
Scrub, scrub, scrub,
scrub, scrub...

436
00:48:09,223 --> 00:48:10,989
Scrub, scrub, scrub...

437
00:48:10,991 --> 00:48:12,294
Scrub, scrub.

438
00:48:15,362 --> 00:48:17,799
There's no immediate
soft tissue damage.

439
00:48:18,198 --> 00:48:20,202
At least that we can
see in the imaging.

440
00:48:22,002 --> 00:48:23,001
And there's no other way
to tell what's going on?

441
00:48:23,003 --> 00:48:24,440
Any other tests?

442
00:48:25,305 --> 00:48:28,009
Unfortunately we just
can't see brain function.

443
00:48:28,175 --> 00:48:28,974
And her breathing is slowing?

444
00:48:28,976 --> 00:48:30,313
That's correct.

445
00:48:31,513 --> 00:48:34,146
If her breathing
continues to deteriorate...

446
00:48:34,148 --> 00:48:35,882
Her heart could literally stop.

447
00:48:35,884 --> 00:48:36,948
Jesus.

448
00:48:36,950 --> 00:48:39,151
She's strong enough.

449
00:48:39,153 --> 00:48:41,453
I don't want one of
those things over her face.

450
00:48:41,455 --> 00:48:44,327
Sara. Please. Just
listen to him.

451
00:48:44,659 --> 00:48:45,892
There is a procedure.

452
00:48:45,894 --> 00:48:47,363
An ECMO.

453
00:48:48,128 --> 00:48:50,131
Essentially, we
funnel out her blood.

454
00:48:51,064 --> 00:48:53,969
We filter it, we oxygenate it,
then we introduce it into her
system.

455
00:48:54,869 --> 00:48:59,442
The new reoxygenated blood could
cause the brain to suddenly wake
up.

456
00:49:00,340 --> 00:49:02,844
Ok, well that's something.

457
00:49:03,578 --> 00:49:05,046
Ok.

458
00:49:06,881 --> 00:49:08,283
Think it over.

459
00:49:12,754 --> 00:49:14,155
Don't do that.

460
00:49:14,556 --> 00:49:15,822
Don't you dare do that.

461
00:49:15,824 --> 00:49:17,690
Sara, calm down.

462
00:49:17,692 --> 00:49:18,724
You want to cut her open?

463
00:49:18,726 --> 00:49:19,961
Go ahead and try.

464
00:49:20,562 --> 00:49:21,861
But you going to have
to cut through me first.

465
00:49:21,863 --> 00:49:23,328
You want to talk about it?

466
00:49:23,330 --> 00:49:24,966
You want to have a rational
discussion about this.

467
00:49:25,365 --> 00:49:26,465
Oh, you can't be
nasty here, right?

468
00:49:26,467 --> 00:49:27,432
Because people might hear you?

469
00:49:27,434 --> 00:49:28,300
Please.

470
00:49:28,302 --> 00:49:30,001
You want me out of here?

471
00:49:30,003 --> 00:49:31,239
Then you're going
to have to drag me out.

472
00:49:42,851 --> 00:49:44,420
You can help her.

473
00:49:45,854 --> 00:49:48,089
You can help her be strong
by being strong yourself.

474
00:49:48,723 --> 00:49:50,393
You need to get some sleep.

475
00:49:50,692 --> 00:49:51,891
Try to rest.

476
00:49:51,893 --> 00:49:53,228
And then what?

477
00:49:54,428 --> 00:49:56,332
Then what happens when
she's all alone in the dark?

478
00:49:56,965 --> 00:49:58,334
We can talk about what to do.

479
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,403
We can be proactive.

480
00:50:02,169 --> 00:50:03,805
Consider things.

481
00:50:21,188 --> 00:50:23,224
I love you.

482
00:50:24,157 --> 00:50:26,261
More than there are
stars in the sky.

483
00:50:27,327 --> 00:50:29,565
I love you more than
there are stars in the sky.

484
00:50:30,632 --> 00:50:32,834
Mommy.

485
00:53:19,266 --> 00:53:20,736
No.

486
00:53:20,768 --> 00:53:23,004
No!

487
00:53:27,675 --> 00:53:30,011
No!

488
00:53:32,146 --> 00:53:33,616
No.

489
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:02,605
Ha! Hack-a-doodle!

490
00:55:03,237 --> 00:55:06,337
Hack-a-doodle, knock-a-knockin!
Knock-a-doodle knock-a-knockin!

491
00:55:06,339 --> 00:55:08,344
Knock-a-doodle, knock-a-knockin.

492
00:55:10,912 --> 00:55:13,179
Momma, can you get
up and play now?

493
00:55:13,181 --> 00:55:14,814
I'm bored.

494
00:55:14,816 --> 00:55:17,082
You've been sleeping
for like ever.

495
00:55:17,084 --> 00:55:19,153
Mommy's so tired.

496
00:55:20,655 --> 00:55:22,625
Why don't you just
come cuddle me, ok?

497
00:55:25,660 --> 00:55:26,258
Ok.

498
00:55:26,260 --> 00:55:27,730
I know a game.

499
00:55:31,364 --> 00:55:32,765
But you're going to have to
close your eyes for this, love.

500
00:55:32,767 --> 00:55:34,099
Ok.

501
00:55:34,101 --> 00:55:34,767
Ok?

502
00:55:34,769 --> 00:55:36,237
Ok.

503
00:55:37,538 --> 00:55:39,173
Close your eyes.

504
00:55:40,274 --> 00:55:43,244
Inside your mind I want you
to start to draw a picture.

505
00:55:44,078 --> 00:55:46,482
I want you to imagine
the most perfect day.

506
00:55:47,648 --> 00:55:49,347
Let's start with the weather.

507
00:55:49,349 --> 00:55:51,283
Is it warm or is it cold?

508
00:55:51,285 --> 00:55:52,084
It's warm.

509
00:55:52,086 --> 00:55:53,519
It's warm.

510
00:55:53,521 --> 00:55:54,857
That's good.

511
00:55:55,523 --> 00:55:57,455
And how does the air
feel on your arms?

512
00:55:57,457 --> 00:55:58,861
We're floating.

513
00:55:59,293 --> 00:56:00,763
Perfect.

514
00:56:01,863 --> 00:56:04,198
And when we're floating, what
do you see when you look around?

515
00:56:04,966 --> 00:56:06,999
I see a cloud boat.

516
00:56:07,001 --> 00:56:09,270
Oh, that sounds magical.

517
00:56:09,502 --> 00:56:11,237
And who's on the boat with you?

518
00:56:11,239 --> 00:56:12,808
You and me.

519
00:56:13,975 --> 00:56:15,511
And where's Daddy?

520
00:56:18,012 --> 00:56:21,383
He's not there because
he doesn't make you happy.

521
00:56:32,860 --> 00:56:34,596
Are you ok?

522
00:56:37,999 --> 00:56:39,435
You...

523
00:56:40,201 --> 00:56:41,603
Don't blink.

524
00:56:42,069 --> 00:56:43,605
Don't smile.

525
00:56:45,873 --> 00:56:47,843
You smiled!

526
00:56:48,276 --> 00:56:50,646
You're blinking!

527
00:56:51,078 --> 00:56:52,978
You did it first!

528
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:55,350
- You did it first!
- You did it first!

529
00:56:56,217 --> 00:56:57,082
What's that?

530
00:56:57,084 --> 00:56:57,883
Sara!

531
00:56:57,885 --> 00:56:59,253
It's Daddy.

532
00:56:59,320 --> 00:57:00,622
We gotta hide.

533
00:57:00,788 --> 00:57:01,954
Go deeper and deeper in here.

534
00:57:01,956 --> 00:57:02,925
We gotta hide.

535
00:57:03,157 --> 00:57:04,023
Come on. Go under the blankets.

536
00:57:04,025 --> 00:57:05,627
Sara!

537
00:57:06,093 --> 00:57:07,529
Sara!

538
00:57:07,995 --> 00:57:10,029
It's almost noon.
Are you still not up yet?

539
00:57:10,031 --> 00:57:10,996
Yeah, I'm...

540
00:57:10,998 --> 00:57:12,367
I'm here, Alex.

541
00:57:12,533 --> 00:57:14,235
Come on. It's not healthy.

542
00:57:14,869 --> 00:57:15,637
Get out!

543
00:57:15,870 --> 00:57:17,339
Hey!

544
00:57:48,836 --> 00:57:50,706
Daddy?

545
00:57:52,373 --> 00:57:55,577
Are you ever going
to stop working?

546
00:58:00,181 --> 00:58:02,384
Emma, I told your mother
not to let you down here.

547
00:58:03,718 --> 00:58:06,889
I've been working all day trying
to provide for you and this
family.

548
00:58:07,822 --> 00:58:10,522
And I have a few extra hours
to work on my novel...

549
00:58:10,524 --> 00:58:11,857
Which is what I
really want to do.

550
00:58:11,859 --> 00:58:13,459
I just need to be left alone.

551
00:58:13,461 --> 00:58:15,030
So please...

552
00:58:15,229 --> 00:58:16,598
Please...

553
00:58:17,598 --> 00:58:19,300
Don't interrupt me.

554
01:01:01,695 --> 01:01:06,465
We who are three...

555
01:01:06,467 --> 01:01:08,333
We see it crimson.

556
01:01:08,335 --> 01:01:11,073
We see red.

557
01:01:15,943 --> 01:01:18,180
We see something.

558
01:01:19,480 --> 01:01:20,916
Something different.

559
01:01:20,948 --> 01:01:23,785
We see something long ago...

560
01:01:31,458 --> 01:01:33,528
A sheltered young Princess...

561
01:01:35,630 --> 01:01:38,633
Who knew nothing
beyond her castle walls.

562
01:01:40,501 --> 01:01:43,702
Birds would glide past her
window and she would say...

563
01:01:43,704 --> 01:01:47,943
If only I knew what it was
to be so alive, so free.

564
01:01:48,342 --> 01:01:51,710
Years passed slowly
for the Princess.

565
01:01:51,712 --> 01:01:55,517
Until her father and mother, the
king and queen, were struck...

566
01:01:56,717 --> 01:02:00,152
By viral intestinal tract
infections from a bad poultry
epidemic which...

567
01:02:00,154 --> 01:02:03,523
Swept through the
kingdom that summer.

568
01:02:03,525 --> 01:02:07,829
Holed up in her tower, the
Princess nearly went mad with
loneliness.

569
01:02:07,962 --> 01:02:10,966
Endless tears clouded her eyes.

570
01:02:11,932 --> 01:02:14,236
Darkness filled her heart.

571
01:02:14,935 --> 01:02:17,873
Her despair knew no end.

572
01:02:19,173 --> 01:02:22,544
Until one day she heard
something down in the courtyard.

573
01:02:23,277 --> 01:02:26,982
A sound so free
it shook something loose.

574
01:02:30,619 --> 01:02:33,288
The sound of children.

575
01:02:35,557 --> 01:02:38,960
And at once the Princess knew
what would cure her loneliness.

576
01:02:39,860 --> 01:02:42,164
To become a human child.

577
01:02:43,897 --> 01:02:46,068
The Princess sent for
her five best scouts.

578
01:02:47,201 --> 01:02:49,604
Bring me the most powerful
witch in all the kingdom!

579
01:02:51,673 --> 01:02:55,777
The scouts roamed the land,
scouring the rims of the
kingdom...

580
01:02:56,511 --> 01:03:01,283
Until one morning, they came
across some magical great Crane.

581
01:03:02,717 --> 01:03:04,986
Bah!  the Crane boomed.

582
01:03:07,555 --> 01:03:10,326
For years I have searched for a
place where no one would find
me.

583
01:03:10,924 --> 01:03:13,995
Who disturbs my solitude?

584
01:03:16,363 --> 01:03:20,202
The scouts dragged the magical
great Crane before the Princess.

585
01:03:23,937 --> 01:03:26,108
And from the
Crane's severed head

586
01:03:26,940 --> 01:03:29,611
perched on its dead tongue

587
01:03:30,311 --> 01:03:33,349
sat a golden
shimmering Witch Toad.

588
01:03:35,482 --> 01:03:38,354
The Witch Toad gazed
into the Princess's heart.

589
01:03:39,286 --> 01:03:43,058
And knew her one true desire.

590
01:03:47,094 --> 01:03:49,764
Each child in the
kingdom fell silent.

591
01:03:51,766 --> 01:03:53,869
Their bright, shining spirit...

592
01:03:54,368 --> 01:03:56,838
Stolen.

593
01:04:08,817 --> 01:04:12,754
With each passing day the
Princess's hunger for children
grew.

594
01:04:14,121 --> 01:04:16,858
And without the
singsong of children

595
01:04:17,424 --> 01:04:21,997
the kingdom faded
into a gray and lifeless place.

596
01:04:57,998 --> 01:05:03,939
And for the first time in her
life the Princess felt light,

597
01:05:04,639 --> 01:05:06,442
and free.

598
01:05:07,742 --> 01:05:10,111
Like a feather on the wind.

599
01:05:13,947 --> 01:05:16,218
But then time passed.

600
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:17,919
First days

601
01:05:18,285 --> 01:05:19,685
weeks

602
01:05:19,687 --> 01:05:21,324
years.

603
01:05:22,824 --> 01:05:27,760
Every night the Princess found
herself sitting alone in her
tallest tower...

604
01:05:27,762 --> 01:05:29,731
Not daring to speak.

605
01:05:30,665 --> 01:05:35,770
Instead she patiently listened
for one sound of happiness

606
01:05:35,804 --> 01:05:38,139
one sound of life.

607
01:05:38,272 --> 01:05:41,243
It was a sound which never came.

608
01:05:50,618 --> 01:05:52,087
Hey.

609
01:05:52,821 --> 01:05:55,156
Can you help me?

610
01:06:19,346 --> 01:06:20,546
It's ok.

611
01:06:20,548 --> 01:06:22,117
Come on.

612
01:06:44,672 --> 01:06:47,310
Wait here. I'm going
to go get my radio.

613
01:06:59,954 --> 01:07:01,923
Emma, sweetie?

614
01:07:02,924 --> 01:07:04,859
I'm so sorry I couldn't...

615
01:07:06,728 --> 01:07:08,063
I couldn't be there.

616
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,135
Everyone is trying so hard here.

617
01:07:17,237 --> 01:07:18,671
All the doctors.

618
01:07:18,673 --> 01:07:20,041
Everybody.

619
01:07:32,386 --> 01:07:34,457
Sometimes I think he's just
telling us what we want to hear.

620
01:07:37,057 --> 01:07:38,494
They were hoping
you would wake up.

621
01:07:39,861 --> 01:07:41,464
That the procedure would work.

622
01:07:46,300 --> 01:07:48,604
But the doctors are
seeing any change.

623
01:07:49,904 --> 01:07:51,206
I knew they wouldn't.

624
01:07:54,876 --> 01:07:56,479
But I know how strong you are.

625
01:07:56,511 --> 01:07:58,279
And I know deep in my bones

626
01:07:59,212 --> 01:08:00,549
that as much as we do here

627
01:08:01,248 --> 01:08:02,585
it's up to you.

628
01:08:03,150 --> 01:08:05,086
You have to find a
way out of the dark.

629
01:08:06,186 --> 01:08:08,923
And when you do, I'll be here.

630
01:08:42,690 --> 01:08:45,260
Come follow me.

631
01:11:02,997 --> 01:11:05,099
Emma, listen to me.

632
01:11:05,199 --> 01:11:06,565
Just pull yourself up.

633
01:11:06,567 --> 01:11:08,671
Pull. Pull yourself up.

634
01:11:09,137 --> 01:11:10,169
Don't use me. You can do it.

635
01:11:10,171 --> 01:11:11,137
You can do it.

636
01:11:11,139 --> 01:11:12,171
Come on. You can.

637
01:11:12,173 --> 01:11:12,738
No, I can't.

638
01:11:12,740 --> 01:11:13,239
I'm letting go.

639
01:11:13,241 --> 01:11:15,141
No, no!

640
01:11:15,143 --> 01:11:16,341
You got it. Emma.

641
01:11:16,343 --> 01:11:18,279
Emma, you got it.

642
01:11:19,213 --> 01:11:21,115
I'm going to let go and you're
going to climb up all by
yourself.

643
01:11:21,314 --> 01:11:22,615
All right. I'm going to let go.

644
01:11:22,617 --> 01:11:23,786
But you're gotta pull.

645
01:11:23,818 --> 01:11:25,487
Ok, pull.

646
01:11:25,620 --> 01:11:27,186
Use your own strength.

647
01:11:27,188 --> 01:11:29,491
You're doing this
all by yourself.

648
01:11:31,826 --> 01:11:33,294
You can do it.

649
01:11:34,195 --> 01:11:35,928
You can do it. That's it.

650
01:11:35,930 --> 01:11:37,062
You've got it.

651
01:11:37,064 --> 01:11:39,031
Pull.

652
01:11:39,033 --> 01:11:40,331
That's it.

653
01:11:40,333 --> 01:11:42,404
So good.

654
01:11:43,037 --> 01:11:44,270
Keep pulling.

655
01:11:44,272 --> 01:11:45,336
You did it!

656
01:11:45,338 --> 01:11:46,709
I see you.

657
01:11:46,941 --> 01:11:48,373
I see you. You did it.

658
01:11:48,375 --> 01:11:49,745
All by yourself.

659
01:11:50,111 --> 01:11:51,747
Ok. Ready? Ok?

660
01:11:52,445 --> 01:11:54,350
I got you. You did so good.

661
01:11:54,381 --> 01:11:56,250
So strong.

662
01:11:56,851 --> 01:11:58,320
So strong.

663
01:11:58,820 --> 01:12:00,221
That's you.

664
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:30,786
I know you can hear me, beauty.

665
01:12:31,351 --> 01:12:32,755
Across the stars.

666
01:12:33,287 --> 01:12:35,391
My voice will carry...

667
01:12:39,727 --> 01:12:42,364
I miss my Mommy and Daddy.

668
01:12:43,064 --> 01:12:44,667
Where are they?

669
01:12:45,398 --> 01:12:47,770
I'm trying to call them.

670
01:12:48,703 --> 01:12:50,773
But we're floating
the other way.

671
01:12:52,940 --> 01:12:55,241
I don't think I'm ever going
to see them again.

672
01:12:55,243 --> 01:12:57,880
Ever, ever again.

673
01:13:02,049 --> 01:13:03,419
You know...

674
01:13:04,886 --> 01:13:07,690
After all the voices in
my kingdom went quiet,

675
01:13:08,556 --> 01:13:11,393
and whenever I would
get sad or feel lonely...

676
01:13:13,160 --> 01:13:15,898
I would lock myself in my room.

677
01:13:18,532 --> 01:13:20,836
And I would stay very still.

678
01:13:23,871 --> 01:13:27,208
And I would think about
what friends would be like

679
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:31,346
if I had them.

680
01:13:31,612 --> 01:13:33,415
What their names would be.

681
01:13:33,848 --> 01:13:35,751
The jokes they would tell.

682
01:13:36,584 --> 01:13:38,554
What their laugh would be like.

683
01:13:39,020 --> 01:13:41,423
I wanted so much
to be loved by others.

684
01:13:41,789 --> 01:13:44,223
I wanted so much
to be loved by others.

685
01:13:44,225 --> 01:13:47,963
That I never learned to
love anyone but myself.

686
01:13:49,196 --> 01:13:53,936
I never learned how my love
could bring people closer to me.

687
01:13:54,467 --> 01:13:55,838
I wish I knew more
when I was young.

688
01:13:56,203 --> 01:13:58,373
I wish I had known
more when I was young.

689
01:13:59,507 --> 01:14:01,275
I wish I had known that the
world was bigger than how I
felt.

690
01:14:01,776 --> 01:14:03,846
I wish I had known
that the world was bigger

691
01:14:04,211 --> 01:14:05,848
than how I felt.

692
01:14:07,748 --> 01:14:09,885
Then there would
still be beauty.

693
01:14:13,821 --> 01:14:16,558
There would still be magic.

694
01:16:27,588 --> 01:16:28,891
Well, I suppose if you...

695
01:16:29,256 --> 01:16:29,925
Yeah.

696
01:16:30,858 --> 01:16:32,291
I mean, it's only been
two months, but...

697
01:16:32,293 --> 01:16:33,459
It's a really
interesting experience.

698
01:16:33,461 --> 01:16:34,460
Really?

699
01:16:34,462 --> 01:16:35,461
Yeah.

700
01:16:35,463 --> 01:16:35,994
That's what you're calling it?

701
01:16:35,996 --> 01:16:36,899
Yeah.

702
01:16:36,931 --> 01:16:38,197
Interesting. Very interesting...

703
01:16:38,199 --> 01:16:38,901
Yeah, well...

704
01:16:39,867 --> 01:16:42,404
It was such an interesting
moment. Between us.

705
01:16:43,437 --> 01:16:45,204
Thanks for coming.
I really appreciate that.

706
01:16:45,206 --> 01:16:47,272
Yeah, I would've
been there sooner

707
01:16:47,274 --> 01:16:49,912
I know you are.
But you've done it before and...

708
01:18:16,397 --> 01:18:18,531
Can you lift me?

709
01:18:18,533 --> 01:18:20,002
Of course.

710
01:20:24,491 --> 01:20:26,628
No, I...

711
01:20:27,061 --> 01:20:30,932
Can't forget this evening.

712
01:20:32,166 --> 01:20:36,872
Or your face as
you were leaving.

713
01:20:38,205 --> 01:20:45,947
But I guess that's just
the way the story goes.

714
01:20:48,349 --> 01:20:55,957
You always smile but in your
eyes your sorrows shows.

715
01:20:58,859 --> 01:21:02,097
Yes, it shows.

716
01:21:03,897 --> 01:21:09,104
No, I can't forget tomorrow.

717
01:21:09,970 --> 01:21:14,377
When I think of all my sorrow.

718
01:21:14,776 --> 01:21:18,381
When I had you there...

719
01:21:18,646 --> 01:21:21,983
But then I let you go.

720
01:21:23,884 --> 01:21:31,427
And now it's only fair
that I should let you know...

721
01:21:32,727 --> 01:21:34,761
What you should know.

722
01:21:34,763 --> 01:21:36,662
Mommy.

723
01:21:36,664 --> 01:21:40,202
I hear you.

724
01:21:43,638 --> 01:21:45,106
My love.

725
01:21:45,973 --> 01:21:47,809
I'm here.

726
01:21:50,477 --> 01:21:52,013
Emma?

727
01:21:53,280 --> 01:21:54,881
Mommy.

728
01:21:54,883 --> 01:21:56,017
My love.

729
01:21:56,216 --> 01:21:58,321
Hey, stay with me.
I'm right here.

730
01:21:59,253 --> 01:22:00,722
It's ok.

731
01:22:07,629 --> 01:22:12,067
Come on, come on, come on.

732
01:22:12,132 --> 01:22:13,735
Come on, Emma.

733
01:22:55,075 --> 01:22:57,779
I want to go home.

734
01:23:00,280 --> 01:23:02,385
I want to go home.

735
01:24:42,182 --> 01:24:43,486
It's ok, Emma.

736
01:24:44,217 --> 01:24:45,887
Hey, I need your help.

737
01:24:46,988 --> 01:24:48,923
I need your help.

738
01:24:52,326 --> 01:24:54,497
I want you to imagine

739
01:24:55,462 --> 01:24:57,400
the most perfect day.

740
01:24:58,198 --> 01:24:59,535
Can you do that for me?

741
01:25:00,735 --> 01:25:02,405
What does it look like?

742
01:25:05,372 --> 01:25:07,041
What does it look like, Emma?

743
01:25:08,676 --> 01:25:10,111
Emma?

744
01:25:21,221 --> 01:25:23,024
There you go.

745
01:25:24,626 --> 01:25:26,060
Stay with it.

746
01:25:26,193 --> 01:25:27,630
How does it feel?

747
01:25:27,962 --> 01:25:29,028
The most perfect day.

748
01:25:29,030 --> 01:25:30,332
Can you picture it?

749
01:25:31,164 --> 01:25:33,134
See it for what it is.

750
01:25:35,870 --> 01:25:38,039
See it for what it is.

751
01:25:49,182 --> 01:25:51,687
You're just all empty.

752
01:26:16,978 --> 01:26:19,981
Emma?

753
01:26:20,048 --> 01:26:23,084
Emma?

754
01:26:25,586 --> 01:26:30,326
I know you can still hear me.

755
01:26:35,262 --> 01:26:38,132
Focus on the details.

756
01:26:39,867 --> 01:26:42,404
The moment.

757
01:26:46,373 --> 01:26:48,310
Picture it.

758
01:26:48,509 --> 01:26:51,012
Clear as a memory.

759
01:26:51,179 --> 01:26:54,148
Clear as today.

760
01:26:55,049 --> 01:26:57,018
Now

761
01:26:57,384 --> 01:26:59,220
tell me the story

762
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:02,223
of your perfect day.

763
01:27:05,225 --> 01:27:08,229
I'm still in my PJs.

764
01:27:11,398 --> 01:27:13,769
We get up really, really early

765
01:27:14,102 --> 01:27:16,137
before the sun is up.

766
01:27:16,938 --> 01:27:18,303
Momma?

767
01:27:18,305 --> 01:27:20,141
Yeah. Shhh.

768
01:27:21,175 --> 01:27:22,645
We're gonna go chase
the sunrise, ok?

769
01:27:25,079 --> 01:27:28,384
We have to be extra quiet
because we're the only ones
awake.

770
01:27:29,249 --> 01:27:30,586
Come on up.

771
01:27:30,818 --> 01:27:31,483
Here you go.

772
01:27:31,485 --> 01:27:33,254
Take off your backpack.

773
01:27:33,353 --> 01:27:34,690
Keep your rhino.

774
01:27:37,525 --> 01:27:40,796
We get our best things
and our favorite toys,

775
01:27:41,095 --> 01:27:43,197
so we can play all day.

776
01:28:00,148 --> 01:28:01,584
What?

777
01:28:04,886 --> 01:28:06,589
I look outside,

778
01:28:07,021 --> 01:28:09,290
and I can see the whole sky,

779
01:28:09,356 --> 01:28:11,092
and the full moon.

780
01:28:12,693 --> 01:28:15,397
There is a face in
it smiling at me.

781
01:28:16,296 --> 01:28:17,763
The face is happy.

782
01:28:17,765 --> 01:28:19,401
So I hum a song.

783
01:28:20,134 --> 01:28:22,838
And all the stars start dancing.

784
01:28:32,580 --> 01:28:35,417
Then the moon and stars
shine on the water.

785
01:28:37,084 --> 01:28:40,422
Twinkling like lightning bugs.

786
01:28:48,796 --> 01:28:50,733
It smells like soggy shoes.

787
01:28:51,331 --> 01:28:54,133
But that's okay cause
we're outside...

788
01:28:54,135 --> 01:28:56,639
And it's suppose to smell
like soggy shoes and things.

789
01:28:57,370 --> 01:28:59,742
We find a spot under a big tree.

790
01:29:00,675 --> 01:29:02,578
And we grow a house
out of the mud.

791
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:08,651
You're making blueberry tea
and ice cream stones...

792
01:29:10,151 --> 01:29:12,153
While me and Daddy play.

793
01:29:13,386 --> 01:29:15,691
He never has to work.

794
01:29:15,957 --> 01:29:18,259
So we play all the time.

795
01:29:21,028 --> 01:29:24,462
And then Daddy skips a rock
all the way across the water.

796
01:29:24,464 --> 01:29:27,266
Until it hits a
toad in the mouth.

797
01:29:27,268 --> 01:29:30,572
And it burps again and again
without saying excuse me.

798
01:29:33,274 --> 01:29:36,779
And no one can find us because
we're so far in the forest.

799
01:29:37,144 --> 01:29:38,476
And no one knows we're there.

800
01:29:38,478 --> 01:29:40,281
Mommy's in!

801
01:29:41,182 --> 01:29:44,486
There's nothing but magic.

802
01:29:46,354 --> 01:29:48,424
And you and Daddy

803
01:29:50,124 --> 01:29:54,228
can't stop smiling
because you're both so happy.

804
01:30:24,692 --> 01:30:27,429
And then the nighttime
knows it's over.

805
01:30:28,930 --> 01:30:31,232
So it rolls on its side and...

806
01:30:31,699 --> 01:30:34,670
Yawns itself to sleep.

807
01:30:38,172 --> 01:30:40,542
But then the sun peeks out.

808
01:30:41,509 --> 01:30:43,579
A perfect morning

809
01:30:44,011 --> 01:30:45,748
to a perfect day.

810
01:33:41,689 --> 01:33:45,427
No, I...

811
01:33:48,796 --> 01:33:52,935
Can't forget this evening.

812
01:33:55,136 --> 01:34:00,142
Or your face as
you were leaving.

813
01:34:04,145 --> 01:34:11,153
But I guess that's just
the way the story goes.

814
01:34:15,189 --> 01:34:22,064
You always smile but
in your eyes your sorrow shows.

815
01:34:24,798 --> 01:34:29,504
Yes, it shows.

816
01:34:43,751 --> 01:34:50,826
No, I can't forget tomorrow
when I think of all my sorrow.

817
01:34:51,392 --> 01:34:57,199
When I had you there
but then I let you go.

818
01:34:58,265 --> 01:35:04,506
And now it's only fair
that I should let you know...

819
01:35:04,939 --> 01:35:09,211
What you should know.

820
01:35:13,314 --> 01:35:20,419
I can't live if
living is without you.

821
01:35:20,421 --> 01:35:23,825
I can't live.

822
01:35:24,058 --> 01:35:27,763
I can't give anymore.

823
01:35:28,195 --> 01:35:35,237
I can't live if
living is without you.

824
01:35:35,436 --> 01:35:38,840
I can't live.

825
01:35:38,973 --> 01:35:44,646
I can't give anymore.

826
01:35:47,682 --> 01:35:50,852
No, I...

827
01:35:52,621 --> 01:35:58,093
I can't give anymore.
