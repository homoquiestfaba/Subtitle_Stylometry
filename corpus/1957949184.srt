to the phonebook.

536
00:49:33,623 --> 00:49:35,084
And?

537
00:49:35,167 --> 00:49:38,048
150 of the names
on this list have
local addresses.

538
00:49:38,131 --> 00:49:41,221
I personally visited
30 of them,

539
00:49:41,304 --> 00:49:43,475
and they're all
very much alive.

540
00:49:43,560 --> 00:49:45,856
What?

541
00:49:45,939 --> 00:49:47,943
Some of them
are pretty common
like "Joe Smith."

542
00:49:48,026 --> 00:49:49,864
But I don't think there's
too many people out there

543
00:49:49,947 --> 00:49:51,868
with a name like
"Harvey Keck."

544
00:49:51,951 --> 00:49:55,499
There's only one, and he
wasn't too happy about me
questioning his existence.

545
00:49:57,671 --> 00:50:01,512
Laura, she's not
hearing voices of
people who are dead.

546
00:50:01,596 --> 00:50:03,182
She's hearing voices
of people who...

547
00:50:03,265 --> 00:50:04,810
Are going to die.

548
00:50:08,317 --> 00:50:10,446
Anything on "Blake"
or what "Nebelt" is?

549
00:50:10,530 --> 00:50:12,826
Not yet.

550
00:50:14,663 --> 00:50:16,792
Well, I got to
get to the bar.

551
00:50:16,876 --> 00:50:19,882
Can't you get someone
to cover for you tonight?

552
00:50:21,594 --> 00:50:25,810
Well, one day when we're
rich and famous ghost hunters,

553
00:50:25,894 --> 00:50:28,733
we can sit around,

554
00:50:28,816 --> 00:50:31,321
watch TV,

555
00:50:31,404 --> 00:50:33,492
make love all day.

556
00:50:34,870 --> 00:50:38,001
Until then,
there's bills to pay.

557
00:50:38,085 --> 00:50:40,297
- You gonna be all right?
- Yeah.

558
00:50:48,021 --> 00:50:50,527
- Well, she's all yours.
- Thanks.

559
00:50:50,610 --> 00:50:52,113
It was nice having you, Emily.

560
00:50:53,448 --> 00:50:55,244
Let's go, Dad.

561
00:50:55,327 --> 00:50:57,206
[screaming]

562
00:51:03,468 --> 00:51:05,055
Bad dream?

563
00:51:06,892 --> 00:51:08,312
Yeah.

564
00:51:13,698 --> 00:51:15,911
Hey, you don't look so hot.

565
00:51:15,994 --> 00:51:16,913
I'm fine.

566
00:51:16,996 --> 00:51:19,083
Why don't you
lie back down again?

567
00:51:19,167 --> 00:51:22,841
I'm just a little dizzy.
Did you find anything?

568
00:51:22,925 --> 00:51:25,012
No.

569
00:51:25,095 --> 00:51:26,682
I've tried every way
I can think of.

570
00:51:26,766 --> 00:51:29,020
Backwards, forwards.

571
00:51:30,022 --> 00:51:31,859
"Bleent" isn't a word, is it?

572
00:51:31,943 --> 00:51:34,782
I don't think so.

573
00:51:37,537 --> 00:51:39,082
It's like it right there.

574
00:51:39,165 --> 00:51:42,004
I know what this is.

575
00:51:42,088 --> 00:51:44,593
[sighs]
Nebelt.

576
00:51:44,677 --> 00:51:46,806
I give up.

577
00:51:46,889 --> 00:51:48,768
What?

578
00:51:48,851 --> 00:51:50,522
Say that again.

579
00:51:50,605 --> 00:51:51,857
Nebelt?

580
00:51:51,941 --> 00:51:53,736
[squeak]
You've got mail.

583

What do you want?

584
00:54:51,007 --> 00:54:52,969
How do you know
about Elizabeth?

585
00:54:53,053 --> 00:54:56,184
I know lots of things.

586
00:54:58,856 --> 00:55:01,486
I know what scares you.

587
00:55:12,049 --> 00:55:16,140
If that's all you can do,
that's why you need Tracy.

588
00:55:16,224 --> 00:55:18,395
For now.

589
00:55:18,478 --> 00:55:22,319
I owe everything to her.
She saved my life that night.

590
00:55:24,282 --> 00:55:27,496
Very soon
this will all be over.

591
00:55:27,581 --> 00:55:31,547
But something
has to happen first.

592
00:55:31,630 --> 00:55:34,051
Those people have to die.

593
00:55:50,375 --> 00:55:53,215
[phone ringing]

594
00:55:56,972 --> 00:55:59,101
- Hello.
- [Melanie] I found him.

595
00:56:00,647 --> 00:56:03,026
[Laura]
Melanie, are you sure
this is the right place?

596
00:56:03,109 --> 00:56:05,322
I used to date a guy who worked
for the phone company.

597
00:56:05,405 --> 00:56:09,413
My ex said that
Blake had mail sent
to this address at one time.

598
00:56:15,927 --> 00:56:17,514
Aren't you coming?

599
00:56:17,597 --> 00:56:20,937
Uh-uh.
You're the ghost woman.

600
00:56:46,572 --> 00:56:48,576
I am Mystic Martha.

601
00:56:48,659 --> 00:56:52,333
Ask me question
about the future,
and I will tell all.

602
00:56:53,961 --> 00:56:55,798
I am Mystic Martha.

603
00:56:55,882 --> 00:56:59,430
Ask me a question
about the future,
and I will tell all.

604
00:57:00,975 --> 00:57:04,482
I am Mystic Martha.
Ask me a question about the--

605
00:58:03,099 --> 00:58:04,770
Holy shit, Melanie.

606
00:58:04,853 --> 00:58:06,272
What did you find?

607
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:10,990
This book talks about
energy transference.

608
00:58:11,074 --> 00:58:13,203
It's taking someone's energy
when they die.

609
00:58:13,286 --> 00:58:15,332
Blake was sick.
That's why he stabbed her.

610
00:58:15,415 --> 00:58:17,587
He thought he could
take her energy
and it would saved him.

611
00:58:17,671 --> 00:58:21,135
If she haven't
hit him that night,
he was going to die anyway.

612
00:58:21,219 --> 00:58:24,601
That's why he said
she saved him.
He can actually do it now.

613
00:58:24,685 --> 00:58:27,272
"He said"?
You talked to him?

614
00:58:27,356 --> 00:58:30,822
- Well, he--
- Never mind.
I don't want to know.

615
00:58:30,905 --> 00:58:33,786
- What else does it say?
- Give me a minute.

616
00:59:43,968 --> 00:59:45,513
What happened?

617
00:59:45,596 --> 00:59:48,435

I wouldn't hesitate
to pull the plug?

Listen to this.

719
01:10:11,388 --> 01:10:13,894
"When a large group or
grouping of people perish,

720
01:10:13,977 --> 01:10:16,398
"as in a massacre
or a cataclysm,

721
01:10:16,482 --> 01:10:19,864
"an enormous amount of energy
is emancipated from
the dying souls.

722
01:10:19,947 --> 01:10:23,663
"One with the fortitude and
stamina to receive such energy

723
01:10:23,747 --> 01:10:27,212
could cure ills
and even stave off death."

724
01:10:27,295 --> 01:10:29,842
That's what he wants.

725
01:10:29,926 --> 01:10:32,932
If he could receive
such an enormous amount
of energy at one time,

726
01:10:33,015 --> 01:10:34,351
he could live again.

727
01:10:34,434 --> 01:10:38,359
Only now he can know
about the accidents
before they happen.

728
01:10:38,442 --> 01:10:41,533
He still needs something
to sustain himself
in the meantime.

729
01:10:41,616 --> 01:10:43,411
He's training her,

730
01:10:43,494 --> 01:10:46,041
feeding off her until
the next accident happens.

731
01:10:46,125 --> 01:10:48,839
- If she lasts that long.
- No. He needs her alive.

732
01:10:48,922 --> 01:10:51,886
That's why she heals so fast.
He's been protecting her.

733
01:10:51,970 --> 01:10:54,851
I think if she died,
there'd be nothing
to tether him here.

734
01:10:54,934 --> 01:10:56,563
He would cease
to exist.

735
01:10:56,646 --> 01:10:58,733
So how do we stop him?

736
01:10:58,817 --> 01:11:00,654
That man--

737
01:11:00,737 --> 01:11:04,119
the one who was after you--

738
01:11:04,202 --> 01:11:05,956
how did you stop him?

739
01:11:06,039 --> 01:11:08,461
We tricked him back into
his own body so he'd be trapped.

740
01:11:08,545 --> 01:11:11,467
So let's find out
where Blake is buried.

741
01:11:11,551 --> 01:11:13,304
That's the first thing
I checked.

742
01:11:13,387 --> 01:11:15,767
Nobody ever claimed the body,
so he was cremated.

743
01:11:19,399 --> 01:11:20,861
I need a drink.

744
01:11:28,960 --> 01:11:30,379
We'll think of something.

745
01:11:36,183 --> 01:11:37,645
[Laura's voice]
Help me, Tracy.

746
01:11:37,728 --> 01:11:38,897
What did you say?

747
01:11:40,609 --> 01:11:41,820
I didn't say anything.

748
01:11:49,084 --> 01:11:51,046
I didn't mean for it
to end it this way.

749
01:11:57,225 --> 01:11:58,310
Oh, my God.

750
01:12:07,245 --> 01:12:08,414
What's wrong?

751
01:12:09,667 --> 01:12:11,378
I think I know.

752
01:12:22,693 --> 01:12:24,196
You can't do this anymore.

753
01:12:25,699 --> 01:12:27,410
- Stop it.
- I'm serious.

754
01:12:27,493 --> 01:12:29,832
- You got to give this up.
- I can't.

755
01:12:29,916 --> 01:12:33,464
- Why?
- 200 people, Glen.

756
01:12:33,548 --> 01:12:35,343
Are we supposed to sit back
and let them die?

757
01:12:35,426 --> 01:12:36,888
We can't stop it anyway.

758
01:12:36,971 --> 01:12:38,642
If we can't stop it,
then I'm dead too.

759
01:12:38,725 --> 01:12:40,144
Don't you get that?
She heard my voice.

760
01:12:40,228 --> 01:12:42,273
Your name wasn't
on the list, Laura.

761
01:12:42,357 --> 01:12:46,073
Besides, there's no way for us
to predict when something's
going to go wrong.

762
01:12:46,156 --> 01:12:47,952
We're not meant to know.

763
01:12:48,035 --> 01:12:51,500
So that's your solution:
just sit back and do nothing.

764
01:12:51,584 --> 01:12:54,715
The only thing we can do is
not be there when it happens.

765
01:12:54,799 --> 01:12:56,803
If we stay away from her,
at least we'll live.

766
01:12:56,886 --> 01:13:01,311
Look, I know that sounds harsh,
but it's the truth.

767
01:13:01,395 --> 01:13:03,065
We have a life together.

768
01:13:03,148 --> 01:13:05,862
How are we supposed to live
when we knew something
was going to happen

769
01:13:05,946 --> 01:13:07,866
and we didn't
lift a finger to stop it?

770
01:13:07,950 --> 01:13:10,162
I'll live just fine
knowing that you're safe.

771
01:13:12,458 --> 01:13:14,421
And then
what happens to Tracy?

772
01:13:16,300 --> 01:13:18,847
I know you want to help her.
I want to help her too.

773
01:13:18,930 --> 01:13:23,063
It's just... we never
dealt with anything
this dangerous before.

774
01:13:23,147 --> 01:13:25,484
I just want you to think
about what you're doing.

Where you going?

776
01:14:04,855 --> 01:14:07,736
Melanie's being released
from the hospital today.

777
01:14:10,491 --> 01:14:12,579
What about the talk
we had last night?

778
01:14:13,915 --> 01:14:15,084
What about it?

779
01:14:20,052 --> 01:14:22,223
I'll get my coat.

780
01:14:27,358 --> 01:14:29,613
How are you feeling?

781
01:14:29,697 --> 01:14:32,911
Like I was thrown
into a washing machine
on high spin cycle.

782
01:14:32,995 --> 01:14:35,792
But I'll survive.

783

Something's not right.

784
01:15:34,744 --> 01:15:36,496
What'd you say?

785
01:15:36,581 --> 01:15:38,500
I said--

786
01:15:51,611 --> 01:15:53,238
Oh, no.

787
01:15:53,322 --> 01:15:55,911
- We got to get out of here.
- What?

788
01:15:55,994 --> 01:15:57,664

of here right now.

- This is it.
