1
00:01:00,990 --> 00:01:02,742
I don't want to hear it.

2
00:01:02,990 --> 00:01:05,379
Honestly, I'm sick of listening
to your lies.

3
00:01:10,030 --> 00:01:11,463
Listen to what I'm saying.

4
00:01:11,710 --> 00:01:15,703
I heard you. But Donna told me
everything you're saying and will say.

5
00:01:19,150 --> 00:01:21,106
-Damn!
-What?

6
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:26,182
Something touched my hand.

7
00:01:30,550 --> 00:01:33,144
-What are you doing, Quint?
-Hold on a second.

8
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:49,986
What the--?

9
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:12,705
You haven't listened to
a word I've said.

10
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:17,224
You know that crazy girl
means nothing to me.

11
00:02:18,230 --> 00:02:19,663
Yeah, well....

12
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:22,299
You have to have
a little more faith in me.

13
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,743
I guess I do.

14
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:41,866
It's tight, but I'm getting through.

15
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,265
Better you than me.

16
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:44,829
Hey, I heard that.

17
00:03:47,190 --> 00:03:49,146
So how's the ammonia levels, doc?

18
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:51,623
Point zero-nine-eight.

19
00:03:54,790 --> 00:03:56,269
Pay dirt, partner.

20
00:03:56,510 --> 00:03:58,387
Looks like a medium roost.

21
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:00,586
Antrozous pallidus, I think.

22
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:01,706
I'll try to get in.

23
00:04:02,390 --> 00:04:05,109
If it gets too tight,
you need to turn around...

24
00:04:05,350 --> 00:04:08,547
...because you do not wanna rely
on me getting your ass up here.

25
00:04:09,190 --> 00:04:11,101
What happened to
sending in a camera?

26
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,308
Jimmy, you know I prefer
the hands-on approach, right?

27
00:04:18,790 --> 00:04:20,542
-Would you do me a favor?
-What?

28
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:22,746
Remind me to lay off the cheesecake.

29
00:04:23,110 --> 00:04:26,944
You're talking to a brother. I don't
mind extra weight in the right place.

30
00:04:29,750 --> 00:04:31,627
About five meters.

31
00:04:32,110 --> 00:04:33,987
Mostly mothers and young.

32
00:04:34,750 --> 00:04:36,229
You might lose me in a minute.

33
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:38,586
Sheila, you know I hate
when that happens.

34
00:04:38,830 --> 00:04:42,140
That's all right.
I got 91 1 programmed in on the cell.

35
00:04:42,590 --> 00:04:47,027
Jimmy, if you hate bats and caves
so much, what are you doing with me?

36
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,461
For one, I won't lie.
You kind of cute.

37
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:51,860
And two, I like them,
but at a distance...

38
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:54,385
...a real distance,
like on Wild Kingdom.

39
00:04:56,510 --> 00:05:00,469
That's why you're down there
and I'm up here. What the hell?!

40
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:02,469
There's some kind of--

41
00:05:21,550 --> 00:05:22,869
What the hell is this?

42
00:05:36,710 --> 00:05:38,143
All the dust!

43
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,829
Who are you?

44
00:05:56,230 --> 00:05:58,186
Why are you landing that thing here?

45
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:01,263
I'm Dr. Tobe Hodge,
the CDC in Atlanta.

46
00:06:01,510 --> 00:06:03,978
-Center for Disease Control?
-I never touched her.

47
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,106
Dr. Casper...

48
00:06:05,350 --> 00:06:09,059
...we need your help immediately.
A plane's waiting to fly us to Texas.

49
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:10,982
Wait a second. Hold on a minute.

50
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:13,983
You're the best in your field,
so we came directly to you.

51
00:06:15,350 --> 00:06:18,501
That's Dr. Alexander McCabe.
He'll be accompanying us.

52
00:06:18,750 --> 00:06:20,980
I don't mean to pry,
but what's this about?

53
00:06:21,230 --> 00:06:22,982
There's a biological emergency.

54
00:06:23,470 --> 00:06:25,108
What kind of biological emergency?

55
00:06:26,270 --> 00:06:28,386
Bats, Dr. Casper.

56
00:06:29,350 --> 00:06:30,339
Bats.

57
00:07:16,750 --> 00:07:18,741
-Sheriff Kimsey?
-Dr. Hodge.

58
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:21,948
Appreciate y'all coming.

59
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:24,663
We have some gear.

60
00:07:24,910 --> 00:07:25,786
I can see that.

61
00:07:26,590 --> 00:07:28,387
You must pack a lot of clout there.

62
00:07:28,630 --> 00:07:31,224
The CDC considers this assignment
to be very important.

63
00:07:31,470 --> 00:07:32,425
Good.

64
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:38,342
Well, hell, let's get to it then.

65
00:07:41,350 --> 00:07:44,422
So, ma'am, you're a doctor
of what exactly?

66
00:07:44,670 --> 00:07:48,299
Wildlife zoology with a speciality
in Chiroptera.

67
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:52,819
Bats, sheriff. I work with bats.

68
00:07:53,510 --> 00:07:54,659
Bats.

69
00:07:56,390 --> 00:07:58,221
So does that make you a bat-ologist?

70
00:08:00,230 --> 00:08:04,109
It makes me a wildlife zoologist
with a speciality in Chiroptera.

71
00:08:27,750 --> 00:08:31,265
To be honest with you, I've never
seen anything like this before.

72
00:08:31,510 --> 00:08:34,263
We'll take over the forensic work,
if that's all right.

73
00:08:34,510 --> 00:08:36,228
Hell, yes. Take over.

74
00:08:36,470 --> 00:08:39,860
I never did care too much
for the sight of blood myself.

75
00:08:49,030 --> 00:08:50,099
It's a damn shame.

76
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:53,940
Some folks think
kids might've done this.

77
00:08:54,190 --> 00:08:57,182
Some satanic cult ritual
or some other such nonsense.

78
00:08:59,390 --> 00:09:00,823
Starting with the male cadaver.

79
00:09:02,470 --> 00:09:05,382
The incision below the
temporomandibular joint at the neck...

80
00:09:05,630 --> 00:09:08,508
...extends in depth all the way
to the hypoglossus muscle.

81
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:15,379
I'm sure that jugular incision was
the initial point of contact.

82
00:09:15,870 --> 00:09:17,269
They went for the lethal attack.

83
00:09:18,030 --> 00:09:20,703
Jimmy, I'd imagine nobody'd mind
if you step outside...

84
00:09:20,950 --> 00:09:22,463
...and keep Doc Swanbeck company.

85
00:09:22,910 --> 00:09:24,707
That's a good idea, sheriff.

86
00:09:25,030 --> 00:09:27,339
You guys just keep doing
what you're doing.

87
00:09:29,950 --> 00:09:32,669
The external anterior jugulars
have been severed down to...

88
00:09:32,910 --> 00:09:35,344
...the carotid on the right side
of the median.

89
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,619
Sheila, I'm gonna need
your confirmation now.

90
00:09:39,110 --> 00:09:40,463
Looking at the neck wounds...

91
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,383
...l'd say we have a bite diameter
of four centimeters...

92
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:47,225
...and a circumference of,
say, 1 3 centimeters.

93
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:02,499
The Pteropodidae family.

94
00:10:04,430 --> 00:10:08,264
This is impossible. These bats
only feed on fruit and nectar.

95
00:10:09,350 --> 00:10:10,465
This can't be.

96
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:13,345
-Excuse me?
-This must be some sick hoax.

97
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:15,945
Unfortunately, we're certain
this is not a hoax.

98
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:18,300
Are you saying some bat did this?

99
00:10:18,550 --> 00:10:20,063
I'm afraid so, sheriff.

100
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,902
There's something very wrong here.

101
00:10:22,150 --> 00:10:24,345
This sort of thing is not
supposed to happen.

102
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:28,020
What's going on?

103
00:10:30,150 --> 00:10:31,708
What is it you aren't telling me?

104
00:10:36,230 --> 00:10:37,948
The number of attacks may be higher.

105
00:10:38,190 --> 00:10:40,658
We've been able to confirm
these five for certain.

106
00:10:40,910 --> 00:10:43,470
Yesterday was the first human
encounter that we know of.

107
00:10:43,710 --> 00:10:46,747
I'd say it was a hell of a lot more
than just an encounter.

108
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:51,222
The attacks were similar and occurred
here in Texas, all in the past six days.

109
00:10:51,430 --> 00:10:52,226
Impossible.

110
00:10:53,150 --> 00:10:53,946
Dr. Casper?

111
00:10:55,190 --> 00:10:57,499
Bats do not kill people. Period.

112
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,704
There must be an explanation.

113
00:11:00,110 --> 00:11:02,704
One that has nothing to do
with bats, and therefore...

114
00:11:02,950 --> 00:11:04,542
...nothing to do with me.

115
00:11:07,710 --> 00:11:08,540
Miss Casper.

116
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:12,184
You're right.

117
00:11:12,430 --> 00:11:15,502
But the bats that we're talking about,
they're very...

118
00:11:16,150 --> 00:11:17,469
...special.

119
00:11:17,830 --> 00:11:18,979
Special....

120
00:11:20,390 --> 00:11:21,266
In what way?

121
00:11:22,150 --> 00:11:24,618
Exactly what are we
talking about, doctor?

122
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:27,704
The two bats that escaped from my lab
were from lndonesia.

123
00:11:28,430 --> 00:11:31,706
They're test subjects. The Pteropus
poliocephalus in question--

124
00:11:31,950 --> 00:11:33,224
Hold on a minute!

125
00:11:34,790 --> 00:11:36,428
We're talking about flying foxes?

126
00:11:38,670 --> 00:11:41,138
Those are among the most endangered
species in the world.

127
00:11:41,390 --> 00:11:44,382
And the ugliest and largest
bats you ever wanna meet.

128
00:11:44,630 --> 00:11:46,348
Let me get this straight.

129
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:50,582
Are you saying you're responsible for
the death of those kids?

130
00:11:50,830 --> 00:11:53,628
Dr. McCabe sought our assistance
as soon as the bats escaped.

131
00:11:53,870 --> 00:11:56,942
We're here to stop them before
they kill or contaminate others.

132
00:11:57,190 --> 00:11:58,589
Contaminate?

133
00:11:59,830 --> 00:12:01,741
What were you guys experimenting with?

134
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:05,621
Well, let's just say it was...

135
00:12:06,150 --> 00:12:07,788
...virus-based.

136
00:12:08,030 --> 00:12:10,703
I really can't discuss it
any further. I'm sorry.

137
00:12:10,950 --> 00:12:14,784
So we're here to help you find
your infected guinea pigs, is that it?

138
00:12:15,230 --> 00:12:16,982
And destroy them, if need be.

139
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:18,299
You can count on that.

140
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:21,862
I'll help you find them,
but I'm not gonna destroy them.

141
00:12:22,950 --> 00:12:24,463
I won't let you destroy them.

142
00:12:24,710 --> 00:12:25,938
Don't worry.

143
00:12:26,190 --> 00:12:29,182
It won't go that far, I assure you.

144
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:34,068
Bats can be anywhere in a 1 00-mile
radius. That's their range.

145
00:12:34,310 --> 00:12:37,859
They could also be in a barn
or under a bridge or in a sewer.

146
00:12:38,110 --> 00:12:40,146
That's just dandy.
But we gotta get started.

147
00:12:40,390 --> 00:12:43,780
So if you had to pick one place
to look, where might that be?

148
00:12:46,030 --> 00:12:47,019
Here.

149
00:12:47,470 --> 00:12:49,779
The attack happened between
the town and national park.

150
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:52,385
This is the corridor
between its roost...

151
00:12:53,470 --> 00:12:54,425
...and its food.

152
00:12:58,830 --> 00:13:00,149
This is Kimsey.

153
00:13:05,550 --> 00:13:06,380
Where?

154
00:13:35,190 --> 00:13:37,829
This definitely won't look good
in the morning paper.

155
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:44,584
These killings weren't done
by a single bat, or even two.

156
00:13:44,870 --> 00:13:47,623
Our bats must be infecting other bats
with the virus.

157
00:13:50,710 --> 00:13:53,622
This is Dr. Sheila Casper.
This is Mayor Branson.

158
00:13:53,990 --> 00:13:56,868
Emmett, tell me what in heaven's name
is going on, would you?

159
00:13:57,110 --> 00:14:00,739
As far as we can tell, we think
this was done by some sort of...

160
00:14:01,470 --> 00:14:02,744
...bats.

161
00:14:04,470 --> 00:14:05,505
-Bats.
-Yes, ma'am.

162
00:14:05,750 --> 00:14:07,422
I know it sounds crazy--

163
00:14:07,670 --> 00:14:09,900
The bats we're referring to
are diseased.

164
00:14:10,150 --> 00:14:12,618
They're infected with
some sort of virus.

165
00:14:12,870 --> 00:14:16,260
We don't know much more yet,
but we hope to soon.

166
00:14:16,510 --> 00:14:19,024
What am I supposed to tell
the families, the town?

167
00:14:19,270 --> 00:14:21,226
We got rabid bats on the loose?

168
00:14:21,470 --> 00:14:23,301
Whatever you say, Amanda, say it now.

169
00:14:23,550 --> 00:14:26,587
Tell folks to stay inside at night
till this all blows over.

170
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:29,105
Deputy Munn will put calls out.
All right, Wesley?

171
00:14:29,350 --> 00:14:32,706
What we need to avoid right now
is any sort of panic.

172
00:14:40,590 --> 00:14:43,309
You can save that panicking stuff
for later.

173
00:14:43,950 --> 00:14:45,224
You mean the TV, radio--

174
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:48,980
Whatever you gotta do, Wesley,
just do it. Get the word out.

175
00:14:49,230 --> 00:14:52,745
And cancel that football game tonight.
They were gonna lose anyway.

176
00:14:54,910 --> 00:14:56,229
Dr. Hodge, anything?

177
00:14:56,470 --> 00:15:00,668
Good news. Preliminary blood tests
from the two teenagers suggest...

178
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:03,378
...that any abnormalities infecting
the bats is...

179
00:15:03,630 --> 00:15:05,939
...completely host-specific
and can't be transferred...

180
00:15:06,190 --> 00:15:07,543
...in active form to humans.

181
00:15:07,790 --> 00:15:09,985
The bats can only infect other bats?

182
00:15:10,230 --> 00:15:12,221
The virus was designed specifically...

183
00:15:12,470 --> 00:15:15,701
...not to be transmittable beyond
the bats' own zoological order.

184
00:15:17,230 --> 00:15:19,698
Dr. McCabe, what exactly did
you do to them?

185
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:22,340
I'm sorry, but I'm not allowed to say.

186
00:15:23,910 --> 00:15:25,628
Now that's bullshit!

187
00:15:25,870 --> 00:15:29,943
Those things are killing people in my
town, and you're directly responsible.

188
00:15:30,190 --> 00:15:31,862
We need to know
what we're dealing with.

189
00:15:32,110 --> 00:15:34,340
I'm curious myself,
now that you mention it.

190
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:38,508
All right, I'll tell you.

191
00:15:39,150 --> 00:15:40,424
Let me know how I do.

192
00:15:41,630 --> 00:15:43,860
You've increased
their natural intelligence.

193
00:15:44,430 --> 00:15:48,264
Yes. And their ability
to work together communally.

194
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:51,468
That's not so bad. We could
all use a little dose of that.

195
00:15:51,710 --> 00:15:54,782
-Then you made them aggressive.
-Now that's bad.

196
00:15:55,230 --> 00:15:56,948
Finally, you made them carnivores.

197
00:15:57,190 --> 00:16:00,466
No, Dr. Casper.
I made them omnivorous.

198
00:16:01,550 --> 00:16:04,018
Put my bats anywhere
in the world and...

199
00:16:05,550 --> 00:16:06,426
...they will feed.

200
00:16:07,310 --> 00:16:08,789
But why would you do that?

201
00:16:09,230 --> 00:16:11,266
Because I'm a scientist.

202
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,342
That's what we do.

203
00:16:14,150 --> 00:16:15,868
We make everything better.

204
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:18,228
Bigger livestock, better crop yields.

205
00:16:18,470 --> 00:16:20,222
Millions of years of evolution.

206
00:16:20,470 --> 00:16:22,381
What arrogance to think
you could do better!

207
00:16:22,630 --> 00:16:24,746
Apparently I have, Dr. Casper.

208
00:16:26,950 --> 00:16:27,905
Apparently I have.

209
00:16:28,430 --> 00:16:30,148
You son of a bitch.

210
00:16:30,390 --> 00:16:31,584
I don't know about you...

211
00:16:31,830 --> 00:16:35,106
...but I don't like anything moving
higher up the food chain than me.

212
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:36,260
Okay, look.

213
00:16:36,510 --> 00:16:38,182
Our chief concern at the moment...

214
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:41,024
...must be ensuring
that this disease...

215
00:16:41,270 --> 00:16:44,068
...is not allowed to spread
to the bat population at large.

216
00:16:44,310 --> 00:16:46,778
Because if their feeding habits are
disrupted...

217
00:16:47,910 --> 00:16:52,381
...say so long to that nice little
balance-of-nature thing we had going.

218
00:16:54,430 --> 00:16:55,783
Take a look at this.

219
00:16:56,390 --> 00:16:58,904
This is a bat migration schematic
I've created.

220
00:16:59,150 --> 00:17:01,459
It traces migrations,
feeding patterns....

221
00:17:01,710 --> 00:17:06,022
I've entered the usual information:
climate, food sources, bat roost.

222
00:17:07,350 --> 00:17:08,829
Those dots?

223
00:17:09,430 --> 00:17:10,579
Those are our bats.

224
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:15,145
Once the temperature changes and they
start freezing, they'll migrate...

225
00:17:15,390 --> 00:17:17,460
...following their food
to temperate climates.

226
00:17:18,550 --> 00:17:20,268
By February, this colony...

227
00:17:20,790 --> 00:17:24,385
...would reach Mexico City,
San Antonio and New Orleans...

228
00:17:24,630 --> 00:17:25,858
...in time for Mardi gras.

229
00:17:26,190 --> 00:17:27,942
If our bats infect other bats...

230
00:17:28,190 --> 00:17:31,341
...and those newly-infected bats
follow their usual patterns...

231
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,262
...of migration--
Show them, Jimmy.

232
00:17:36,390 --> 00:17:38,187
That is six months from now.

233
00:17:38,510 --> 00:17:40,580
And it ain't gonna be pretty.
Of course...

234
00:17:40,830 --> 00:17:42,866
...my ass will be long gone by then.

235
00:17:43,110 --> 00:17:46,307
If we don't stop them, what happened
to those kids will happen all over.

236
00:17:46,550 --> 00:17:47,949
So what do we do now?

237
00:17:48,190 --> 00:17:51,865
The only way to stop the spread
is to locate the roost...

238
00:17:53,190 --> 00:17:55,750
...and to annihilate
every last infected bat.

239
00:18:17,430 --> 00:18:19,580
So you reckon these things'll
hold them?

240
00:18:20,910 --> 00:18:24,539
-They're called mist nets.
-Feels like fishnet stocking to me.

241
00:18:25,150 --> 00:18:27,710
They're a little tougher
than they look, sheriff.

242
00:18:29,190 --> 00:18:30,782
Wesley, Jimmy, come in.

243
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:32,588
-Yes, sir.
-How y'all doing?

244
00:18:32,830 --> 00:18:36,140
We're getting along gangbusters.
We just hung those net things.

245
00:18:36,590 --> 00:18:38,103
They're called mist nets.

246
00:18:38,350 --> 00:18:40,625
Whatever. They feel like
fishnet stockings.

247
00:18:40,870 --> 00:18:41,939
How about that.

248
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:44,146
Let me know if you see anything.

249
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:46,346
You'll be the first to know.
Trust me.

250
00:18:46,670 --> 00:18:48,547
Yes, give me that information.

251
00:18:53,110 --> 00:18:56,261
Local law enforcement is adequate.
They're on a need-to-know basis.

252
00:18:56,510 --> 00:18:57,829
Same as the team.

253
00:18:58,630 --> 00:18:59,665
He's here.

254
00:18:59,910 --> 00:19:01,343
He's with me now.

255
00:19:02,790 --> 00:19:04,940
Fine. They're in the field.

256
00:19:06,150 --> 00:19:08,539
She's very competent.
I was impressed with her.

257
00:19:17,150 --> 00:19:18,424
Blood on the moon.

258
00:19:18,670 --> 00:19:19,898
Excuse me?

259
00:19:20,350 --> 00:19:22,659
My mama said that
when the moon was red...

260
00:19:22,910 --> 00:19:25,868
...there was blood on the moon
and somebody'd get killed.

261
00:19:26,910 --> 00:19:30,789
Sheriff, if you're trying to
put me at ease, it's not working.

262
00:19:35,590 --> 00:19:36,545
Sorry about that.

263
00:19:36,790 --> 00:19:38,109
It's okay.

264
00:19:42,310 --> 00:19:43,902
If you don't mind, what's that?

265
00:19:44,670 --> 00:19:45,739
This?

266
00:19:46,350 --> 00:19:48,306
It's an ancient Chinese symbol
for the bat.

267
00:19:48,710 --> 00:19:52,020
Chinese consider bats good luck.
Harbingers of good fortune.

268
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:55,139
What got you into bats
in the first place?

269
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,942
Well, when I was a little girl growing
up back in Ohio, we had a barn.

270
00:20:00,590 --> 00:20:02,182
Had some bats in it.

271
00:20:03,270 --> 00:20:05,943
Scared me. Used to give me
horrific nightmares.

272
00:20:06,990 --> 00:20:09,584
One night, my dad finally
dragged me out back...

273
00:20:09,830 --> 00:20:11,388
...and caught one of the bats.

274
00:20:11,790 --> 00:20:15,226
He explained the good things bats do,
like pollinating rain forests...

275
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:17,586
...and eating insects
and what have you.

276
00:20:17,990 --> 00:20:20,140
And then he made me hold it.

277
00:20:21,950 --> 00:20:23,508
And I gotta tell you...

278
00:20:23,750 --> 00:20:25,980
...it was the gentlest thing
I'd ever seen.

279
00:20:29,310 --> 00:20:30,982
I've been bat-crazy ever since.

280
00:20:33,110 --> 00:20:35,704
Killing one goes against
everything I believe.

281
00:20:37,110 --> 00:20:39,908
You catch one tonight,
I'll pet its belly for you.

282
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:42,380
I might even take it
to dinner and a movie.

283
00:20:48,350 --> 00:20:49,305
There's too many.

284
00:20:49,550 --> 00:20:51,427
-What do you mean?
-Let's go!

285
00:21:04,150 --> 00:21:05,822
Come on! Come on!

286
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:47,938
Cover the vents!

287
00:21:48,190 --> 00:21:49,225
Any possible entrance!

288
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:50,619
Hurry up!

289
00:21:51,470 --> 00:21:55,224
Well, that's all being
taken care of, sir, as we speak.

290
00:21:55,470 --> 00:21:57,381
We're gonna need
some help down here!

291
00:22:00,110 --> 00:22:01,509
Son of a bitch!

292
00:22:02,790 --> 00:22:04,906
They're trying to get in!

293
00:22:05,150 --> 00:22:06,139
What's going on?

294
00:22:06,550 --> 00:22:09,064
These things, they're not like
any bats I've ever seen!

295
00:22:09,310 --> 00:22:11,380
They're trying to get into the truck!

296
00:22:11,630 --> 00:22:12,745
Where'd I put my keys?

297
00:22:13,550 --> 00:22:14,778
We're on our way.

298
00:22:25,030 --> 00:22:26,099
I can't find my keys!

299
00:22:30,950 --> 00:22:32,861
They're trying to get
into the engine!

300
00:22:33,470 --> 00:22:34,380
Whatever you do...

301
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:38,225
...try and stay calm. I ain't calm,
and I'm telling her to stay calm.

302
00:22:46,830 --> 00:22:48,104
Son of a bitch!

303
00:22:48,950 --> 00:22:49,939
Come on!

304
00:22:57,990 --> 00:22:59,184
Shit!

305
00:23:04,150 --> 00:23:05,629
Sheila, they're getting in!

306
00:23:15,550 --> 00:23:16,346
Get it off!

307
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:23,306
Shit!

308
00:23:32,190 --> 00:23:34,420
Sheila? Do you hear me? Come in!

309
00:23:35,190 --> 00:23:36,862
Sheila, you hear me? Come in!

310
00:23:40,630 --> 00:23:41,540
Clear it!

311
00:23:47,510 --> 00:23:48,989
Are you okay?

312
00:23:56,870 --> 00:23:58,428
Holy shit!

313
00:24:00,230 --> 00:24:03,586
-Use your gun! Shoot at them!
-I'll hit the sheriff and Sheila.

314
00:24:03,830 --> 00:24:05,821
Shoot over them. Scare them off.

315
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:14,302
Then again, we could just
hightail it out of here now.

316
00:24:49,830 --> 00:24:52,025
Hold still.
Let me take a look at you.

317
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,460
Hold on a sec.

318
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:57,821
You okay? Are you all right?

319
00:24:58,110 --> 00:25:00,544
I ain't never seen anything like that.

320
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:07,628
They left something behind.

321
00:25:07,950 --> 00:25:09,906
God, sheriff, don't move.
Don't move!

322
00:25:14,630 --> 00:25:15,904
All right, be careful.

323
00:25:16,150 --> 00:25:17,378
On three. One...

324
00:25:17,630 --> 00:25:18,824
...two, three!

325
00:25:26,310 --> 00:25:28,380
That's why I leave that stuff to her.

326
00:25:32,270 --> 00:25:34,465
What did I tell you?

327
00:25:35,270 --> 00:25:36,385
Ugly!

328
00:25:36,630 --> 00:25:38,507
Now this might sting a little.

329
00:25:39,990 --> 00:25:41,582
I been doing some thinking.

330
00:25:41,990 --> 00:25:43,867
And what I figured out is this:

331
00:25:44,830 --> 00:25:45,979
This is fucked up!

332
00:25:46,550 --> 00:25:48,859
I'm thinking of heading
to Antarctica now!

333
00:25:49,110 --> 00:25:52,898
I checked into this. There's no bats
there because they hate the cold.

334
00:25:53,350 --> 00:25:54,260
Hey, Wes?

335
00:25:54,510 --> 00:25:57,183
Get ahold of the mayor.
Make sure everyone is inside...

336
00:25:57,430 --> 00:25:59,148
...and their houses are secure.

337
00:26:00,150 --> 00:26:01,629
Go on, now, get on it.

338
00:26:04,910 --> 00:26:06,866
-That should do for now.
-Thanks.

339
00:26:08,390 --> 00:26:09,266
Holy shit!

340
00:26:15,750 --> 00:26:17,149
McCabe's bats.

341
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:24,739
-Sheriff, do you have your gun?
-In my hand.

342
00:26:25,750 --> 00:26:28,389
This might be a good time to use it.

343
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:30,302
You only have to clip their wings.

344
00:26:30,630 --> 00:26:32,029
Clip their wings?

345
00:26:32,470 --> 00:26:35,382
Would you shoot their damn heads off?
And don't miss.

346
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:44,739
Damn!

347
00:26:48,030 --> 00:26:49,986
-Are you all right?
-Yeah, we're great.

348
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:51,903
Nice timing.

349
00:26:52,870 --> 00:26:54,269
Thank God you got one.

350
00:26:54,870 --> 00:26:56,747
I need to study it immediately.

351
00:26:56,990 --> 00:26:59,220
We've got other plans for this one.

352
00:27:00,470 --> 00:27:01,789
Catch your own.

353
00:27:03,590 --> 00:27:04,659
All right....

354
00:27:05,430 --> 00:27:07,990
When I open the cage,
grab him by the neck and wings.

355
00:27:08,230 --> 00:27:09,140
Are you crazy?

356
00:27:09,390 --> 00:27:11,620
Try to be gentle, but firm.

357
00:27:11,950 --> 00:27:14,418
-I can handle that.
-I'm sure you can, Emmett.

358
00:27:14,670 --> 00:27:15,785
Okay, you ready?

359
00:27:16,110 --> 00:27:19,102
On three, gentlemen.
One, two, three!

360
00:27:21,230 --> 00:27:22,458
That sucker's strong!

361
00:27:23,870 --> 00:27:24,905
Okay, easy.

362
00:27:27,030 --> 00:27:28,861
Would you take his other wing?

363
00:27:29,110 --> 00:27:30,668
Please? Thank you.

364
00:27:30,950 --> 00:27:32,668
Oh, no, Jimmy, thank you.

365
00:27:33,550 --> 00:27:34,983
He won't tear that bug out?

366
00:27:35,230 --> 00:27:37,824
It's injected under the skin
where he can't reach it.

367
00:27:38,430 --> 00:27:40,466
-Won't hurt him, though.
-That's a relief.

368
00:27:41,430 --> 00:27:42,499
We're in business.

369
00:27:42,750 --> 00:27:46,504
I'm telling you, this won't work.
I know what they're capable of.

370
00:27:46,750 --> 00:27:49,344
-You getting a clear fix?
-Crystal clear, baby.

371
00:27:49,590 --> 00:27:50,625
Great.

372
00:27:51,270 --> 00:27:54,706
Should be able to pinpoint the roost's
entrance to within a few feet.

373
00:27:54,950 --> 00:27:57,339
I lied. I ain't gonna pet
this thing's belly.

374
00:27:58,350 --> 00:27:59,703
Don't let us down, sweetie.

375
00:28:07,310 --> 00:28:08,743
How's it tracking?

376
00:28:08,990 --> 00:28:12,187
Perfectly. Long as it
keeps moving away from me.

377
00:28:33,230 --> 00:28:34,265
Houston...

378
00:28:34,510 --> 00:28:35,659
...we got a problem.

379
00:28:59,590 --> 00:29:01,228
We can capture another bat.

380
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:04,019
Can't we? Just try again.

381
00:29:04,990 --> 00:29:06,389
That could take days.

382
00:29:06,630 --> 00:29:07,904
What do we do now?

383
00:29:08,510 --> 00:29:10,944
Evacuate the town immediately.

384
00:29:11,590 --> 00:29:14,627
Order an evacuation
for 1 00 miles, here to Mexico.

385
00:29:14,870 --> 00:29:16,019
And Hodge...

386
00:29:16,670 --> 00:29:18,308
...we're gonna need more help.

387
00:29:19,230 --> 00:29:20,299
A lot more help.

388
00:29:23,710 --> 00:29:25,780
You can study it now if you like.

389
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:35,138
I ordered reinforcements.
They'll arrive in the morning.

390
00:29:35,390 --> 00:29:36,425
Effective immediately...

391
00:29:36,670 --> 00:29:40,219
...the CDC is evacuating the town
of Gallup, Texas.

392
00:29:40,710 --> 00:29:42,189
Good work, Hodge.

393
00:29:43,190 --> 00:29:45,624
Evacuation? I think
that's a good idea, doc.

394
00:29:45,870 --> 00:29:48,145
Based on this localized program...

395
00:29:48,790 --> 00:29:52,783
...it looks like them damn things have
been making their way towards town.

396
00:29:53,950 --> 00:29:55,781
We might still have some time.

397
00:31:39,270 --> 00:31:40,180
Manny...

398
00:31:40,430 --> 00:31:41,579
...you got any ketchup?

399
00:32:58,670 --> 00:32:59,739
What is going on?

400
00:32:59,990 --> 00:33:02,902
What are these people doing out?
I thought they were warned.

401
00:33:03,150 --> 00:33:04,469
As far as I knew, they were.

402
00:33:12,110 --> 00:33:13,543
Thank God you're here.

403
00:33:13,790 --> 00:33:16,702
Christ in a sidecar!
What are all these people doing out?

404
00:33:16,950 --> 00:33:19,862
We've warned them six ways to Sunday!
Nobody believes it.

405
00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:22,499
Everybody in Texas thinks
they know everything.

406
00:33:22,750 --> 00:33:23,660
Oh, my God.

407
00:33:24,510 --> 00:33:25,386
What is it?

408
00:33:26,790 --> 00:33:27,825
They're coming.

409
00:33:28,190 --> 00:33:30,385
Echolocation calls, their sonar,
I can hear it.

410
00:33:34,910 --> 00:33:35,945
They're coming!

411
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:41,505
Oh, my God.

412
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:43,579
Oh, my God!

413
00:33:43,830 --> 00:33:44,899
Move off the streets!

414
00:33:45,630 --> 00:33:47,860
Everybody get inside! Please!

415
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,668
Get inside right now!

416
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:51,946
Hurry up, everybody! Take cover!

417
00:33:52,190 --> 00:33:53,464
Take cover, please!

418
00:33:53,870 --> 00:33:56,304
Come on! Everybody get inside!
Let's go!

419
00:34:16,150 --> 00:34:17,299
You gotta get inside!

420
00:34:17,550 --> 00:34:19,188
Get in the theater! Get inside!

421
00:34:19,430 --> 00:34:20,658
Close the doors!

422
00:34:33,630 --> 00:34:35,586
-You all right?
-Get out of here!

423
00:34:35,830 --> 00:34:36,865
Get out of here!

424
00:34:45,110 --> 00:34:46,429
Amanda, get inside!

425
00:34:46,670 --> 00:34:48,262
Hell with that!

426
00:34:52,990 --> 00:34:53,786
Oh, God!

427
00:35:00,550 --> 00:35:01,949
All right, everybody, back!

428
00:35:03,870 --> 00:35:06,179
Let's just take it easy, okay?

429
00:35:09,230 --> 00:35:11,266
God, this isn't good.

430
00:35:11,710 --> 00:35:13,462
Take it easy. Back!

431
00:36:10,750 --> 00:36:11,546
Get in the back.

432
00:36:12,110 --> 00:36:13,429
Go! Now!

433
00:36:30,390 --> 00:36:31,425
Get down! Get down!

434
00:38:16,670 --> 00:38:18,388
Come on! Come on!

435
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:19,619
Get inside!

436
00:38:19,910 --> 00:38:21,343
Get in there! Get in there!

437
00:38:22,350 --> 00:38:23,180
Stay calm!

438
00:39:00,350 --> 00:39:01,942
Hey, mister, hold on!

439
00:39:02,790 --> 00:39:04,701
Mister, there's people down here!

440
00:39:05,670 --> 00:39:06,944
Oh, shit!

441
00:39:26,190 --> 00:39:27,179
Get inside now!

442
00:40:23,670 --> 00:40:25,103
You all right?

443
00:40:28,190 --> 00:40:29,259
Y'all all right?

444
00:40:34,390 --> 00:40:35,425
He saved me.

445
00:40:37,670 --> 00:40:39,661
He saved my life.

446
00:40:40,310 --> 00:40:41,459
My God.

447
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:45,226
Jesus.

448
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:02,419
-I can't believe it.
-It's all right, honey.

449
00:41:23,630 --> 00:41:26,190
Anything you see,
radio it in immediately!

450
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:47,984
Damn it, Wesley.

451
00:42:37,510 --> 00:42:38,829
Excuse me, ma'am.

452
00:42:43,590 --> 00:42:45,820
All right.
We'll see what we can do.

453
00:42:48,830 --> 00:42:50,422
They're evacuating everybody now.

454
00:42:51,150 --> 00:42:53,505
Airstrip's closed.
They got roadblocks.

455
00:42:53,870 --> 00:42:56,828
Mexicans are clearing everybody
down to Oaxaca and Rosita.

456
00:42:57,070 --> 00:42:58,742
Jesus, Emmett.

457
00:42:58,990 --> 00:43:00,742
What are we gonna do now?

458
00:43:01,550 --> 00:43:03,142
I'm still working on that.

459
00:43:38,750 --> 00:43:39,865
Old Texas custom.

460
00:43:43,590 --> 00:43:46,343
This evacuation covers
the entire town, doesn't it?

461
00:43:47,550 --> 00:43:49,666
Yeah. No one's going in or out now.

462
00:43:50,470 --> 00:43:51,983
So tell me something.

463
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:53,822
What are we still doing here?

464
00:43:54,150 --> 00:43:55,583
We asked them to let us stay.

465
00:43:55,990 --> 00:43:57,218
Say what?

466
00:43:57,470 --> 00:43:59,108
To aid in destroying the bats.

467
00:44:00,030 --> 00:44:02,669
You gotta be pulling my leg.
This shit is not funny.

468
00:44:02,910 --> 00:44:05,344
They're only giving us 48 hours.

469
00:44:05,750 --> 00:44:08,787
Why am I the only one
who doesn't know about this?

470
00:44:09,030 --> 00:44:11,783
48 hours before they launch
a military air strike...

471
00:44:12,030 --> 00:44:13,509
...armed with missiles.

472
00:44:13,750 --> 00:44:16,310
They'll bomb every cave,
cavern and foxhole...

473
00:44:16,550 --> 00:44:18,461
...in a 1 00-mile radius of Gallup.

474
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:20,706
What? Are they crazy?

475
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:23,862
They'll kill everything
in Gallup, and not a single bat.

476
00:44:24,110 --> 00:44:26,704
That's right. And we cannot
let them do that.

477
00:44:26,950 --> 00:44:30,306
Now, I begged them for this chance,
and they agreed.

478
00:44:30,550 --> 00:44:33,110
But we're basically on our own.

479
00:44:33,510 --> 00:44:36,707
I won't let them blow my town
off the earth without a fight.

480
00:44:36,950 --> 00:44:39,669
People have homes here.
They got their whole lives here.

481
00:44:39,910 --> 00:44:41,946
I'll make sure they got
something to come back to.

482
00:44:42,190 --> 00:44:46,069
We're sure to be quarantined for the
next month, whether we stay or not.

483
00:44:46,310 --> 00:44:47,379
He's staying too?

484
00:44:48,790 --> 00:44:50,428
I created them.

485
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:55,868
This will give me time
to review my work...

486
00:44:56,350 --> 00:44:58,261
...and figure out what went wrong.

487
00:44:59,670 --> 00:45:01,388
Jimmy, we could use your help.

488
00:45:02,630 --> 00:45:04,825
I understand if you
don't wanna hang around.

489
00:45:08,990 --> 00:45:10,708
Let me tell you one thing:

490
00:45:11,550 --> 00:45:14,189
If another one of your bats
looks at me...

491
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:17,308
...if his head moves like this,
or his eyes go like this...

492
00:45:17,550 --> 00:45:19,063
...like he might look at me...

493
00:45:19,310 --> 00:45:20,709
...l'm coming for you.

494
00:45:23,150 --> 00:45:24,708
Does that mean you'll stay?

495
00:45:27,110 --> 00:45:28,225
I'll stay.

496
00:45:30,470 --> 00:45:34,543
Something called a Chroma B-340.
The newest thing in spy satellites.

497
00:45:34,910 --> 00:45:36,662
When it passes over Texas...

498
00:45:36,910 --> 00:45:40,823
...they'll center infrared cameras
on a 50-mile radius south of Gallup.

499
00:45:41,070 --> 00:45:42,264
Give us a direct feed.

500
00:45:42,510 --> 00:45:45,468
When the bats emerge from their roost,
it'll be your turn.

501
00:45:45,710 --> 00:45:48,907
The military wants to be as hands-off
about this as possible.

502
00:45:49,150 --> 00:45:51,664
You'll have to make the l.D.
Think you can do that?

503
00:45:52,190 --> 00:45:53,589
I can try.

504
00:46:00,310 --> 00:46:01,504
This is our school.

505
00:46:01,750 --> 00:46:04,662
It's not as primitive as you'd
think for a small town.

506
00:46:04,910 --> 00:46:06,787
We can fortify it
as good as any.

507
00:46:07,030 --> 00:46:08,099
Let's hope so.

508
00:46:18,110 --> 00:46:19,782
You can set up in the science room.

509
00:46:20,030 --> 00:46:23,784
The computers have high-speed modems.
Try to hook us up to Langley.

510
00:46:24,150 --> 00:46:25,902
Let's secure the building before dark.

511
00:46:26,150 --> 00:46:27,663
Yeah, I heard that.

512
00:47:06,350 --> 00:47:07,385
What is that?

513
00:47:08,990 --> 00:47:12,869
That is Montserrat singing
Donizetti's Lucia.

514
00:47:13,110 --> 00:47:15,624
A real touchstone
of the bel canto repertoire.

515
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:18,948
You're an opera fan, sheriff.
I'm impressed.

516
00:47:32,830 --> 00:47:34,582
Don't mention my hidden vice.

517
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:37,219
Folks would run me out of town
if they knew.

518
00:47:37,550 --> 00:47:39,586
Don't worry.
Your secret's safe with me.

519
00:47:41,550 --> 00:47:43,268
You are a sick individual.

520
00:47:48,630 --> 00:47:49,540
Get out!

521
00:49:01,870 --> 00:49:05,385
There. We are now as secure
as the goddamn Alamo.

522
00:49:07,510 --> 00:49:09,148
Bad example there, Jimmy.

523
00:49:09,990 --> 00:49:10,979
You're right.

524
00:49:11,230 --> 00:49:15,348
Maybe we should hang up a few cloves
of garlic. What do you think?

525
00:49:20,150 --> 00:49:24,268
I got hooked up to the base. Once the
satellite passes, they'll send photos.

526
00:49:24,510 --> 00:49:25,784
That'll work.

527
00:49:26,030 --> 00:49:28,100
And once we find them, then what?

528
00:49:30,190 --> 00:49:33,341
Let's assume they're all living
in the same roost.

529
00:49:33,590 --> 00:49:36,309
Given their communal behavior,
I'd say that's likely.

530
00:49:36,750 --> 00:49:37,546
Poison?

531
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:41,345
Not an option. The most popular
poison for bats is chlorophacinone.

532
00:49:41,590 --> 00:49:44,309
Largely ineffective against them
and lethal for humans.

533
00:49:44,550 --> 00:49:47,189
Believe me, I checked into this
a long time ago.

534
00:49:49,990 --> 00:49:51,218
Maybe if we trap them?

535
00:49:51,470 --> 00:49:53,426
Whatever we do,
we have to get them all.

536
00:49:53,670 --> 00:49:55,661
Why not just bomb
the sons of bitches?

537
00:49:57,270 --> 00:49:59,261
An explosion would scatter them...

538
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:02,308
...and might not even kill
all that many.

539
00:50:02,550 --> 00:50:05,303
This is like a nightmare.
I'll never sleep again.

540
00:50:06,830 --> 00:50:08,548
Wait a minute. That's it.

541
00:50:09,350 --> 00:50:10,385
What?

542
00:50:10,790 --> 00:50:12,269
We'll put them to sleep.

543
00:50:14,110 --> 00:50:17,785
When the temperature drops below
40 degrees, bats begin to hibernate.

544
00:50:18,710 --> 00:50:20,109
But at 32...

545
00:50:22,150 --> 00:50:23,424
...they freeze to death.

546
00:50:23,750 --> 00:50:24,944
But how do we do it?

547
00:50:25,190 --> 00:50:26,543
Especially in a heat wave.

548
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:29,702
We need cooling units powerful enough
to freeze the roost.

549
00:50:31,950 --> 00:50:33,269
Well, all right.

550
00:50:33,510 --> 00:50:35,865
Call Langley.
See what they can come up with.

551
00:50:36,110 --> 00:50:37,338
I'll check it out.

552
00:50:43,670 --> 00:50:45,740
You're thinking of walking
into that roost...

553
00:50:45,990 --> 00:50:47,787
...with those things over your head.

554
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:50,863
Bats are nocturnal.
We go in there during the day--

555
00:50:51,310 --> 00:50:52,663
But those are normal bats--

556
00:50:52,910 --> 00:50:54,184
I know.

557
00:50:55,310 --> 00:50:57,028
We don't have any other choice.

558
00:51:28,310 --> 00:51:29,902
Yeah. I got it.

559
00:51:30,710 --> 00:51:35,420
We are all set. There's something
called the NGIC lndustrial.

560
00:51:35,670 --> 00:51:39,106
A cooler that emits a combination
of Freon, CO2 and pure oxygen...

561
00:51:39,350 --> 00:51:40,829
...at superhuman velocity.

562
00:51:41,070 --> 00:51:43,425
It could cover Cairo in icicles
in three days.

563
00:51:43,670 --> 00:51:44,864
Good enough.

564
00:51:45,110 --> 00:51:46,429
Once we locate the roost...

565
00:51:46,670 --> 00:51:49,230
...they'll do an airlift
and drop-off at the entrance.

566
00:51:49,470 --> 00:51:52,303
That's as far as they'll go.
They don't wanna know about us.

567
00:51:52,550 --> 00:51:55,826
-They're preparing for a bomb raid.
-We'll need special gear to go in.

568
00:51:56,430 --> 00:51:57,419
What?

569
00:51:58,550 --> 00:52:00,347
We're going into the roost?

570
00:52:02,030 --> 00:52:02,826
All of us?

571
00:52:04,030 --> 00:52:06,544
Don't worry. You'll stay out
and monitor our progress.

572
00:52:08,870 --> 00:52:10,622
Right. Maybe next time.

573
00:52:25,510 --> 00:52:27,341
We are at drop zone.

574
00:52:27,830 --> 00:52:29,229
Commence drop.

575
00:52:48,310 --> 00:52:49,868
Lift with your legs!

576
00:52:51,270 --> 00:52:54,580
If I had legs like that,
I'd probably use them more often.

577
00:52:56,230 --> 00:52:58,903
I ordered the best body armor
they had. You'll need it.

578
00:52:59,150 --> 00:53:00,788
This is all Kevlar, steel-reinforced.

579
00:53:03,750 --> 00:53:04,705
You don't say.

580
00:53:05,470 --> 00:53:08,621
The breathing gear is used to
protect us from the ammonia fumes.

581
00:53:08,870 --> 00:53:10,781
In a roost with millions of bats...

582
00:53:11,030 --> 00:53:13,385
...ammonia from the guano can reach
lethal levels.

583
00:53:13,630 --> 00:53:15,461
-Guano?
-It's bat shit.

584
00:53:15,710 --> 00:53:17,029
Oh. Yeah, right.

585
00:53:18,350 --> 00:53:20,705
Wonder how that one slipped out
of my mental thesaurus.

586
00:53:20,950 --> 00:53:24,625
Trust me. You don't wanna die
choking on no bat shit fumes.

587
00:53:27,990 --> 00:53:30,185
That's it. Last page.

588
00:53:43,830 --> 00:53:45,388
This looks like them.

589
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:56,459
Sheila, y'all need to take
a look at this.

590
00:54:06,270 --> 00:54:07,100
That's them.

591
00:54:09,390 --> 00:54:10,982
Those are our bats.

592
00:54:11,950 --> 00:54:13,383
No, this can't be right.

593
00:54:13,630 --> 00:54:16,667
This is a mountainous area, northeast
of the national park.

594
00:54:16,910 --> 00:54:18,423
We ruled that area out already.

595
00:54:18,670 --> 00:54:20,706
There are no caves there.
There's no way.

596
00:54:20,950 --> 00:54:23,828
Well, that's because they're not
in a cave at all.

597
00:54:24,350 --> 00:54:25,544
They're in a mine.

598
00:54:29,230 --> 00:54:30,788
The mine is right in here.

599
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:33,624
It was recently shut down.
It's not on any maps...

600
00:54:33,870 --> 00:54:37,101
...but it's huge, and it's called
Black Rock Mines.

601
00:54:43,750 --> 00:54:46,708
-Black Rock Mines. Are you certain?
-That's affirmative.

602
00:54:46,950 --> 00:54:48,781
We're absolutely certain about that.

603
00:54:49,030 --> 00:54:51,225
Good work. We'll be there at dawn.

604
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:52,664
All right.

605
00:54:59,510 --> 00:55:04,106
Sir, they've located the bats.
We're clear to move in at 0600 hours.

606
00:55:04,390 --> 00:55:06,540
No, that's no longer an option.

607
00:55:07,750 --> 00:55:11,106
Who knows where they'll be? lf we
go in while they're out feeding....

608
00:55:11,830 --> 00:55:14,139
Based on the nature
of these creatures...

609
00:55:14,390 --> 00:55:16,665
...l strongly suggest we wait
for daybreak.

610
00:55:16,910 --> 00:55:20,380
You don't need to tell me
how dangerous they are, major.

611
00:55:20,710 --> 00:55:23,747
The government's worked
on this project for over a decade.

612
00:55:23,990 --> 00:55:26,299
McCabe was working
in weapons development.

613
00:55:26,630 --> 00:55:28,382
Yes, major, it was us.

614
00:55:28,630 --> 00:55:30,188
We started it...

615
00:55:30,630 --> 00:55:31,949
...and now we'll end it.

616
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:46,184
These are from a geological survey.
I figure the bats have to be here.

617
00:56:46,430 --> 00:56:49,422
They're deeper. They wouldn't allow
themselves to be that vulnerable.

618
00:56:49,670 --> 00:56:52,184
Since it's man-made,
the trip down should be easy...

619
00:56:52,710 --> 00:56:55,463
...if there hasn't been too much
collapse in the tunnels.

620
00:56:55,710 --> 00:56:57,302
How about other entrances?

621
00:56:57,590 --> 00:57:01,742
The entrance the bats are using is
the only one this place has ever had.

622
00:57:02,190 --> 00:57:05,102
One entrance, nice tunnel down.
Should be a piece of cake.

623
00:57:05,390 --> 00:57:06,709
No, it won't.

624
00:57:10,670 --> 00:57:12,467
They'll know you're there.

625
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:15,141
They'll know what you're up to.

626
00:57:15,990 --> 00:57:17,981
They'll try and stop you.

627
00:57:19,750 --> 00:57:21,502
What are you talking about?

628
00:57:23,150 --> 00:57:24,219
They're always aware.

629
00:57:25,230 --> 00:57:26,868
That's how I designed them.

630
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,260
To be perfect killing machines.

631
00:57:29,510 --> 00:57:31,341
-What?
-Son of a bitch!

632
00:57:34,190 --> 00:57:35,179
They found us.

633
00:57:35,430 --> 00:57:38,467
-How? How could they get--?
-Because I called them here.

634
00:57:39,550 --> 00:57:40,346
And now...

635
00:57:40,950 --> 00:57:42,508
...we'll put an end to all this.

636
00:57:46,950 --> 00:57:48,144
They're taking out the power!

637
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:58,627
Those bats didn't escape from
your lab, did they, McCabe?

638
00:57:58,870 --> 00:57:59,700
You let them go.

639
00:57:59,950 --> 00:58:01,702
Very perceptive, Sheila.

640
00:58:01,950 --> 00:58:04,066
How could you? You knew
what they were capable of!

641
00:58:15,390 --> 00:58:17,950
You know how many people have died?
Do you even care?

642
00:58:18,190 --> 00:58:19,908
They simply need to be controlled!

643
00:58:21,270 --> 00:58:24,342
If you understood them the way I do,
you could control them!

644
00:58:24,590 --> 00:58:26,581
Then do it! Control them!

645
00:58:26,830 --> 00:58:28,024
Stop them right now!

646
00:58:31,470 --> 00:58:32,789
Why would I wanna do that?

647
00:58:40,950 --> 00:58:42,349
Son of a bitch!

648
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:44,625
They're getting in!

649
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:13,625
Look out!

650
00:59:17,230 --> 00:59:20,108
Stay away from the windows!
I'm firing up the generator!

651
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:29,627
They're getting through here!
Come on! Get out of here!

652
00:59:44,510 --> 00:59:45,579
I hate this shit!

653
00:59:58,430 --> 00:59:59,385
Work with Daddy!

654
01:00:04,550 --> 01:00:05,460
Shit!

655
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:12,379
It's on now. Get back!
Get back, right now!

656
01:00:12,630 --> 01:00:14,666
Get back! Get away from the window!

657
01:00:20,390 --> 01:00:21,266
Get out of here!

658
01:00:22,470 --> 01:00:24,540
I got something for your asses now!

659
01:00:25,110 --> 01:00:26,338
Come on!

660
01:00:29,830 --> 01:00:31,548
Burn, you goddamn rats! Burn!

661
01:00:31,790 --> 01:00:33,826
You want some of this?
Come on!

662
01:00:34,350 --> 01:00:36,341
You done messed with
the wrong brother!

663
01:00:36,590 --> 01:00:37,500
Come on! Burn!

664
01:00:39,510 --> 01:00:41,228
You ain't getting this ass!

665
01:00:41,670 --> 01:00:44,230
Can you handle this, motherfucker?!
Damn!

666
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:01,144
You piece of shit!

667
01:01:18,150 --> 01:01:20,459
Come on! Work with me!
Come on, baby!

668
01:01:21,190 --> 01:01:22,782
Work with me! Come on!

669
01:01:37,110 --> 01:01:38,304
Now come on!

670
01:02:12,550 --> 01:02:13,585
Come on!

671
01:02:40,750 --> 01:02:42,229
Come on back here, now.

672
01:02:42,790 --> 01:02:44,826
Doctor, just come back inside slowly.

673
01:02:46,190 --> 01:02:47,589
Don't you see?

674
01:02:48,470 --> 01:02:49,425
They want me.

675
01:02:51,950 --> 01:02:53,668
They've come for me.

676
01:02:55,750 --> 01:02:57,581
Because I can control them.

677
01:03:00,710 --> 01:03:02,348
I made them that way.

678
01:03:12,270 --> 01:03:13,464
Come to me.

679
01:03:43,430 --> 01:03:44,783
Hey, listen.

680
01:03:50,390 --> 01:03:51,743
They're gone.

681
01:03:56,430 --> 01:03:58,341
Because they got what they came for.

682
01:04:43,310 --> 01:04:44,584
Oh, my God.

683
01:04:45,350 --> 01:04:47,022
They tried to do it.

684
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:49,980
They tried to go in during the night.

685
01:04:50,710 --> 01:04:52,701
Would you look at this shit?

686
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:54,785
Damn!

687
01:05:12,630 --> 01:05:13,665
It's down there.

688
01:05:14,190 --> 01:05:15,339
What is?

689
01:05:16,430 --> 01:05:18,864
Refrigeration unit.
It's a big one.

690
01:05:19,150 --> 01:05:21,186
They wired this whole place
with explosives.

691
01:05:21,750 --> 01:05:24,583
-To seal the mine.
-That seems to be the plan.

692
01:05:29,430 --> 01:05:30,465
Command, come in.

693
01:05:30,710 --> 01:05:33,588
This is Sheriff Emmett Kimsey.
I'm with Dr. Sheila Casper.

694
01:05:33,830 --> 01:05:35,388
We're at the Black Rock Mines.

695
01:05:35,950 --> 01:05:37,178
Major Reid here.

696
01:05:37,430 --> 01:05:40,547
Sheriff, right now there's
an air campaign headed your way...

697
01:05:40,790 --> 01:05:43,668
... with instructions to bomb
and gas that mine...

698
01:05:43,910 --> 01:05:46,663
... in exactly 62 minutes
and counting.

699
01:05:46,910 --> 01:05:48,741
I suggest you get out of there. Now.

700
01:05:49,710 --> 01:05:50,620
We can't do that.

701
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:54,626
If they bomb, the bats will scatter.
No one will be able to stop them.

702
01:05:55,790 --> 01:05:59,066
I don't know if you know this, but
your cooling unit is in the cavern.

703
01:05:59,270 --> 01:06:00,066
Yes, sheriff.

704
01:06:00,270 --> 01:06:02,989
Those men were unable to turn it on.
That mission failed.

705
01:06:03,590 --> 01:06:04,579
What?

706
01:06:07,270 --> 01:06:09,226
We have to go down and turn it on.

707
01:06:10,790 --> 01:06:13,543
If you can give us time,
we can turn this thing on.

708
01:06:13,790 --> 01:06:15,348
I will not halt this air strike!

709
01:06:15,590 --> 01:06:18,502
Understand? Get out of there,
and that is an order.

710
01:06:18,790 --> 01:06:20,906
Listen to me. We are here right now!

711
01:06:21,150 --> 01:06:23,869
We can turn it on.
You gotta give us a chance!

712
01:06:24,110 --> 01:06:26,670
Listen, I'm making the call.
Now get out!

713
01:06:27,190 --> 01:06:27,986
Shit!

714
01:06:32,150 --> 01:06:33,822
We got about an hour.

715
01:06:34,230 --> 01:06:37,381
To get down there, turn on the
unit and seal the entrances.

716
01:07:35,830 --> 01:07:36,706
Look over there.

717
01:07:39,430 --> 01:07:40,624
Good.

718
01:07:40,990 --> 01:07:42,787
Say the word. I'm at your command.

719
01:07:43,190 --> 01:07:45,829
If there's any problem,
you know what you have to do.

720
01:07:46,190 --> 01:07:49,580
What are you talking about? You'll
both be up here with me by then.

721
01:07:53,310 --> 01:07:55,904
We are the only ones who know
how bad this can be.

722
01:07:56,150 --> 01:07:58,983
I need to know you'll blow
that entrance if you have to.

723
01:07:59,270 --> 01:08:02,342
Trust me, Sheila.
It's not gonna come to that.

724
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:04,868
But you'll do it.

725
01:08:08,430 --> 01:08:09,988
You can count on me.

726
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:21,666
What's that saying? "Any day
above ground is a good day"?

727
01:08:22,190 --> 01:08:23,669
When this is over...

728
01:08:23,950 --> 01:08:25,986
...l'm laying on the beach
for three years...

729
01:08:26,230 --> 01:08:27,743
...where they never heard of a bat.

730
01:08:27,990 --> 01:08:30,663
Fire up the blender.
I'll bring the tequila.

731
01:09:49,750 --> 01:09:50,899
Two tunnels.

732
01:09:51,710 --> 01:09:53,109
There's only one on the map.

733
01:09:54,830 --> 01:09:55,740
Great.

734
01:09:58,630 --> 01:10:00,188
You gotta make a choice.

735
01:10:00,950 --> 01:10:01,826
To the right.

736
01:10:02,590 --> 01:10:03,943
See those over there?

737
01:10:04,190 --> 01:10:06,499
Those are possum bones.
Possums don't live here.

738
01:10:06,750 --> 01:10:09,867
One of our bats dragged them in here
as an in-flight snack.

739
01:10:10,510 --> 01:10:14,423
Very good, sheriff. I'll make you
a chiropterologist yet.

740
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:47,620
You all right?

741
01:10:48,150 --> 01:10:49,549
Are you all right?

742
01:10:50,710 --> 01:10:51,904
Fine.

743
01:10:54,670 --> 01:10:56,422
What's with this water?

744
01:10:56,710 --> 01:10:58,268
It's guano.

745
01:10:58,510 --> 01:11:00,978
It's filled with parasites
and insects...

746
01:11:01,230 --> 01:11:03,107
...that feed on it.

747
01:11:03,350 --> 01:11:06,706
Are you kidding me? I am not
up to my chest in bat shit!

748
01:11:06,950 --> 01:11:08,019
I'm afraid you are.

749
01:11:09,510 --> 01:11:10,306
Nasty.

750
01:11:10,550 --> 01:11:11,869
Is this what you call normal?

751
01:11:12,110 --> 01:11:15,898
I wouldn't call anything I've seen
in the last few days " normal."

752
01:11:16,710 --> 01:11:19,178
I truly did not think
it could get any worse.

753
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:46,183
Wait a minute.

754
01:11:46,630 --> 01:11:49,383
If there's this much guano
in here, then....

755
01:11:49,990 --> 01:11:50,866
Jesus.

756
01:11:51,110 --> 01:11:53,260
Welcome to ground zero, sheriff.

757
01:11:58,510 --> 01:11:59,943
Oh, my God.

758
01:12:00,590 --> 01:12:03,150
I never would've believed it
if I didn't see it.

759
01:12:16,270 --> 01:12:18,340
God, there must be millions of them.

760
01:12:27,750 --> 01:12:29,945
You folks need to be real quiet
right now.

761
01:12:30,190 --> 01:12:33,580
It's taken you 1 5 minutes to descend.
You have 30 minutes...

762
01:12:33,830 --> 01:12:36,549
...to fire up that cooling unit
and get your asses back up.

763
01:12:36,870 --> 01:12:38,462
What's the temperature down there?

764
01:12:40,550 --> 01:12:41,824
Fifty-two.

765
01:12:42,190 --> 01:12:43,623
It's better than we hoped.

766
01:13:15,430 --> 01:13:18,627
Just curious, but anybody have
any idea how to work this thing?

767
01:13:18,870 --> 01:13:20,269
I know you're not asking me.

768
01:13:20,510 --> 01:13:22,660
Let's hope they remembered
to gas it up.

769
01:13:22,910 --> 01:13:24,389
That would be nice.

770
01:13:24,790 --> 01:13:26,667
Okay, hurry up. Losing time.

771
01:13:26,990 --> 01:13:28,867
This shouldn't be too difficult.

772
01:13:35,590 --> 01:13:37,467
We need a key
to complete this job.

773
01:13:38,790 --> 01:13:40,348
-Shit!
-Damn it!

774
01:14:02,710 --> 01:14:03,586
I found one.

775
01:14:04,270 --> 01:14:05,749
Let's hope it's the right one.

776
01:14:21,270 --> 01:14:23,738
It's working. It's working
like a dream.

777
01:14:25,110 --> 01:14:28,580
Bravo, as they say in opera.
Get up here before the fat lady sings.

778
01:14:28,830 --> 01:14:30,582
Avenger, you're clear to arm.

779
01:14:30,830 --> 01:14:32,502
Roger, base. We're arming.

780
01:14:43,830 --> 01:14:45,229
Oh, shit!

781
01:14:47,750 --> 01:14:49,183
I think we better keep moving.

782
01:15:11,510 --> 01:15:12,943
Oh, God!

783
01:15:21,830 --> 01:15:23,104
It's gone.

784
01:15:23,350 --> 01:15:26,023
No, they're just circling their prey.

785
01:15:29,670 --> 01:15:32,343
If we don't make it, you know
what we discussed, right?

786
01:15:32,910 --> 01:15:34,628
You gotta blow that entrance.

787
01:15:34,950 --> 01:15:36,622
Yeah. Sure.

788
01:15:36,870 --> 01:15:38,098
We have no other choice.

789
01:15:38,350 --> 01:15:40,625
Yes, you do! You have seven minutes.
Come on!

790
01:15:50,830 --> 01:15:51,899
I lost your video!

791
01:15:52,950 --> 01:15:54,986
Get it off me! Get it off me!

792
01:16:06,990 --> 01:16:07,900
Get it off!

793
01:17:12,870 --> 01:17:13,825
Shoot it!

794
01:17:15,310 --> 01:17:16,140
Shit!

795
01:17:31,510 --> 01:17:32,909
We gotta get out of here!

796
01:18:13,230 --> 01:18:14,948
-Can you breathe okay now?
-Yeah.

797
01:18:21,910 --> 01:18:23,138
How much time?

798
01:18:23,390 --> 01:18:25,062
Four minutes! Come on!

799
01:18:25,310 --> 01:18:27,266
Initiating firebombing run.

800
01:18:58,390 --> 01:18:59,300
Come on!

801
01:19:01,550 --> 01:19:04,383
-We're not gonna make it!
-You will! Come on!

802
01:19:26,550 --> 01:19:27,744
Jump! Jump!

803
01:19:33,830 --> 01:19:35,388
Commencing final approach.

804
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:37,109
-Come on!
-Go! Go!

805
01:19:49,230 --> 01:19:50,185
Blow the entrance!

806
01:19:50,430 --> 01:19:51,749
You can make it!

807
01:20:11,350 --> 01:20:12,578
Now!

808
01:21:00,270 --> 01:21:01,259
Call them off!

809
01:21:01,750 --> 01:21:03,661
Major, call off your boys!

810
01:21:04,110 --> 01:21:04,906
We did it!

811
01:21:05,110 --> 01:21:06,179
We sealed the mine!

812
01:21:06,470 --> 01:21:09,542
Are you sure? We have to be
absolutely certain.

813
01:21:10,310 --> 01:21:11,345
Am I certain?!

814
01:21:11,590 --> 01:21:13,546
Is pig pork? Yes, I'm certain!

815
01:21:14,510 --> 01:21:16,626
-Here you go, sir.
-What's the status?

816
01:21:21,350 --> 01:21:22,544
All right.

817
01:21:22,950 --> 01:21:25,145
We got satellite confirmation.
Good work.

818
01:21:25,470 --> 01:21:26,823
Get the hell out of there.

819
01:21:28,870 --> 01:21:31,384
Avenger, abort mission.
Return to base.

820
01:21:31,630 --> 01:21:32,983
Roger, we are RTB.

821
01:21:33,510 --> 01:21:34,420
You okay?

822
01:21:35,910 --> 01:21:37,502
Yeah. You?

823
01:21:39,750 --> 01:21:41,024
You all right? You okay?

824
01:21:41,550 --> 01:21:42,778
I'll live.

825
01:21:45,910 --> 01:21:48,663
You did it! Damn it!
I told you, Sheila.

826
01:21:50,750 --> 01:21:52,103
Just hold that there.

827
01:21:59,310 --> 01:22:01,187
The temperature's dropping fast.

828
01:22:01,430 --> 01:22:05,309
Our bats should be sound asleep,
their little bat asses frozen forever.

829
01:22:06,950 --> 01:22:08,702
Provided there are
no other entrances.

830
01:22:08,950 --> 01:22:11,464
No, that's it.
That's the only way in or out.

831
01:22:18,190 --> 01:22:19,464
Good job, guys.

832
01:22:20,870 --> 01:22:21,700
Honey...

833
01:22:22,030 --> 01:22:23,304
...you stink.

834
01:22:25,230 --> 01:22:26,629
I don't smell anything.

835
01:22:27,110 --> 01:22:28,338
I smell bat doo-doo.

836
01:22:28,590 --> 01:22:32,424
Before you get all precious, you ought
to take a look in a damn mirror.

837
01:22:32,870 --> 01:22:34,747
That ain't your best look, either.

838
01:22:38,190 --> 01:22:39,305
Come on, doo-doo!

839
01:22:40,470 --> 01:22:42,620
It's about time for a cigar.

840
