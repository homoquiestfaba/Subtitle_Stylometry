I don't know.

I pulled over.

And there was like, this
weird clicking noise.

118
00:15:45,312 --> 00:15:49,482
And I saw a man wearing
a gas mask.

119
00:15:49,482 --> 00:15:52,352
I thought there was just one
of them, and then I looked,

120
00:15:52,352 --> 00:15:55,122
and there were more.

192
00:22:14,233 --> 00:22:15,468
He looks just like you.

193
00:22:23,376 --> 00:22:25,311
Really?

194
00:22:25,311 --> 00:22:27,814
Definitely.

195
00:22:27,814 --> 00:22:29,115
That's funny.

196
00:22:29,115 --> 00:22:30,216
Everyone always said that
he looked like Jonathan.

197
00:22:41,761 --> 00:22:43,730
Sorry.

198
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:45,331
This shouldn't have
been there.

199
00:22:48,234 --> 00:22:51,337
Is that his new book?

200
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:52,071
You...

201
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:55,908
You know who he is?

202
00:22:55,908 --> 00:22:57,577
Well, yeah.

203
00:22:57,577 --> 00:22:58,911
Doesn't everybody?

204
00:22:58,911 --> 00:23:03,349
It must be so cool to be married
to somebody famous.

205
00:23:03,349 --> 00:23:04,383
You'd think.

206
00:23:08,488 --> 00:23:10,423
What's it about?

207
00:23:10,423 --> 00:23:12,224
I can't say.

208
00:23:12,224 --> 00:23:13,392
[kettle whistling]

209
00:23:13,392 --> 00:23:14,627
Why not?

210
00:23:18,330 --> 00:23:20,700
[door closing]

211
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:21,701
Oh!

212
00:23:21,701 --> 00:23:23,335
Here, let me help you.

213
00:23:23,335 --> 00:23:24,236
No, no, no.

214
00:23:24,236 --> 00:23:25,304
Don't touch it.

215
00:23:25,304 --> 00:23:26,005
I've got it!

216
00:23:26,005 --> 00:23:31,277
[kettle whistling]

217
00:23:31,277 --> 00:23:34,547
JONATHAN (OFFSCREEN):
What's going on?

218
00:23:34,547 --> 00:23:36,449
You guys all right?

219
00:23:36,449 --> 00:23:37,450
Hey.

220
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:42,789
[kettle whistling]

221
00:23:42,789 --> 00:23:44,223
You...

222
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,073
So...

223
00:24:01,073 --> 00:24:01,974
What is that?

224
00:24:01,974 --> 00:24:03,510
This was stuck in your tires.

225
00:24:03,510 --> 00:24:05,444
Whoa, are you all right?

226
00:24:05,444 --> 00:24:08,280
Let me see that.

227
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,348
She's fine.

228
00:24:09,348 --> 00:24:13,385
Um, uh, we should
clean that up.

229
00:24:13,385 --> 00:24:14,420
Did you see anything
out there?

230
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,622
No, just a bunch
of beer bottles.

231
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:17,456
Uh, can you get some
bandaids, please?

232
00:24:17,456 --> 00:24:18,491
Yeah.

233
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:28,901
I think there's some peroxide
in here somewhere.

234
00:24:47,920 --> 00:24:49,556
Rachel, let me see your hand.

235
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,528
Sit down.

236
00:24:55,528 --> 00:24:56,929
Where are the bandaids?

237
00:24:56,929 --> 00:24:58,364
Couldn't find them.

238
00:25:00,533 --> 00:25:01,901
Oh, she...

239
00:25:07,874 --> 00:25:08,941
This is probably going to
sting a little bit.

240
00:25:08,941 --> 00:25:10,376
It's nothing, really.

241
00:25:21,387 --> 00:25:22,989
I'm so sorry.

242
00:25:22,989 --> 00:25:23,590
Hm?

243
00:25:23,590 --> 00:25:25,592
It's all right.

244
00:25:25,592 --> 00:25:28,360
No, I mean...

245
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,395
What?

246
00:25:31,764 --> 00:25:34,834
You don't have to
pretend anymore.

247
00:25:34,834 --> 00:25:36,268
Occupational hazard.

248
00:25:40,439 --> 00:25:41,874
I know what happened.

249
00:25:43,776 --> 00:25:45,411
To Thomas.

250
00:25:50,382 --> 00:25:52,652
I'm sorry.

251
00:25:52,652 --> 00:25:55,421
Oh.

252
00:25:55,421 --> 00:26:01,661
Well, I'm, uh, surprised
she told you his name.

253
00:26:12,104 --> 00:26:16,075
RACHEL (OFFSCREEN): Maybe
she's trying to move on.

254
00:26:16,075 --> 00:26:17,176
JONATHAN (OFFSCREEN):
Or move out.

255
00:26:17,176 --> 00:26:18,310
RACHEL (OFFSCREEN):
Oh, I didn't...

256
00:26:18,310 --> 00:26:20,412
I didn't know that
it was like that.

257
00:26:20,412 --> 00:26:21,147
No, no, no.

258
00:26:21,147 --> 00:26:23,683
She's, she's just...

259
00:26:23,683 --> 00:26:25,317
Well, it's hard, you know?

260
00:26:28,020 --> 00:26:36,996
I mean, he really was just
an amazing person.

261
00:26:36,996 --> 00:26:41,100
And I know everybody says that
about their own kid, but, I

262
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:44,804
mean, you should have seen
Addie and him together.

263
00:26:44,804 --> 00:26:46,438
They were...

264
00:26:48,675 --> 00:26:50,109
She...

265
00:26:53,813 --> 00:26:57,016
She just used to be
the happiest.

266
00:27:04,957 --> 00:27:10,997
Maybe there's a way to move
on without letting go.

267
00:27:15,968 --> 00:27:17,136
I hope...

268
00:27:17,136 --> 00:27:17,737
I hope I haven't overstepped
anything.

269
00:27:17,737 --> 00:27:18,604
No, it's...

270
00:27:18,604 --> 00:27:20,506
It's just good to talk about it.

271
00:27:25,211 --> 00:27:28,447
You know, the day that
he drowned...

272
00:27:42,161 --> 00:27:44,964
Thank you.

273
00:27:44,964 --> 00:27:47,599
Now, uh, why don't
we take you home?

274
00:27:47,599 --> 00:27:51,003
Sorry, it's just that there's
nobody home at my house right

275
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,105
now, and I really don't want
to be a burden, but after

276
00:27:53,105 --> 00:27:56,642
tonight, the thought of being
alone in the house is just

277
00:27:56,642 --> 00:27:57,944
terrifying.

278
00:27:57,944 --> 00:28:01,580
Can I please just stay here
until the morning?

279
00:28:01,580 --> 00:28:02,581
Sure.

280
00:28:02,581 --> 00:28:05,617
It's fine.

281
00:28:05,617 --> 00:28:07,553
It's fine.

282
00:28:07,553 --> 00:28:09,889
Thank you.

283
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:13,625
There are, uh, there's blankets
in the closet,

284
00:28:13,625 --> 00:28:15,094
there's towels under the sink.

285
00:28:15,094 --> 00:28:18,197
And well, I guess you already
know where the kitchen is.

286
00:28:18,197 --> 00:28:19,565
I do.

287
00:28:19,565 --> 00:28:21,533
We'll see you in the morning.

288
00:28:21,533 --> 00:28:22,969
See you in the morning.

289
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:27,606
Night.

290
00:28:46,658 --> 00:28:49,628
How could you do that?

291
00:28:49,628 --> 00:28:51,463
How could I do what?

292
00:28:54,633 --> 00:28:56,568
Who is she?

293
00:28:56,568 --> 00:28:58,070
She's our neighbor.

294
00:28:58,070 --> 00:28:59,105
Then how come we haven't seen
her around the neighborhood?

295
00:28:59,105 --> 00:29:01,874
Because we never
leave the house.

296
00:29:01,874 --> 00:29:03,709
Did you really find her car?

297
00:29:03,709 --> 00:29:04,676
What are you talking about?

298
00:29:04,676 --> 00:29:06,345
She's a fan, John.

299
00:29:06,345 --> 00:29:07,713
What?

300
00:29:07,713 --> 00:29:09,715
She's a fucking fan.

301
00:29:09,715 --> 00:29:12,651
She knows who you are.

302
00:29:12,651 --> 00:29:13,786
So?

303
00:29:13,786 --> 00:29:14,486
What if she made all
this shit up?

304
00:29:14,486 --> 00:29:16,122
She's just a kid.

305
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:20,626
What if you already
fucked her?

306
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:22,294
Stop.

307
00:29:22,294 --> 00:29:23,796
Just stop.

308
00:29:23,796 --> 00:29:27,967
I just heard my husband share
the most intimate details of

309
00:29:27,967 --> 00:29:31,370
our lives to a total
fucking stranger.

310
00:29:31,370 --> 00:29:32,571
It could be a lie.

311
00:29:32,571 --> 00:29:35,274
I wouldn't have to stare
at myself, wishing...

313
00:29:45,117 --> 00:29:45,717
Sorry.

314
00:29:45,717 --> 00:29:48,988
Hey, I'm sorry.

315
00:29:48,988 --> 00:29:50,222
OK?

316
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:54,626
I don't like her.

317
00:29:54,626 --> 00:29:55,862
I hate her.

Ad.

00:32:08,827 --> 00:32:10,029
Ad, come on.

00:32:14,400 --> 00:32:17,503
Hey, you OK?

Addie.

00:32:23,509 --> 00:32:24,943
OK?

00:32:27,479 --> 00:32:28,880
You don't...

338
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,782
You don't hear that?

339
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,218
Hear what?

340
00:32:35,387 --> 00:32:36,355

She's not here.

350
00:34:08,980 --> 00:34:11,983
What were you doing
Thomas' room?

351
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:13,652
Nothing, I was just getting
my backpack out.

352
00:34:13,652 --> 00:34:14,953
Oh bullshit.

353
00:34:14,953 --> 00:34:16,488
You put this upstairs.

354
00:34:16,488 --> 00:34:17,923
Why?

355
00:34:17,923 --> 00:34:18,424
I didn't...

356
00:34:18,424 --> 00:34:19,625
Why?

357
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:20,392
I don't know what you're
talking about.

358
00:34:20,392 --> 00:34:21,227
All right, that's it.

359
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:22,894
JONATHAN (OFFSCREEN): Hey.

360
00:34:25,664 --> 00:34:27,966
Here.

361
00:34:27,966 --> 00:34:30,035
What were you doing in here?

362
00:34:30,035 --> 00:34:31,036
Addie, just...

363
00:34:31,036 --> 00:34:31,503
No!

364
00:34:31,503 --> 00:34:34,005
No.

365
00:34:34,005 --> 00:34:34,706
What were you doing in here?

366
00:34:34,706 --> 00:34:36,108
Nothing, I swear.

367
00:34:41,380 --> 00:34:43,315
It's them.

368
00:34:43,315 --> 00:34:44,015
It's them.

369
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:46,185
I know it's them.

370
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:47,686
JONATHAN (OFFSCREEN): It's
probably just a fuse, OK?

371
00:34:47,686 --> 00:34:49,121
I'll go check the box.

372
00:35:28,093 --> 00:35:29,961
You have to call someone.

373
00:35:29,961 --> 00:35:31,397
It's just a fuse.

00:35:53,485 --> 00:35:54,119
See?

376
00:35:54,119 --> 00:35:55,321
It was a fuse.

377
00:36:03,195 --> 00:36:04,196
No!

378
00:36:04,196 --> 00:36:05,597
No!

00:36:05,597 --> 00:36:07,599

00:47:14,432 --> 00:47:16,767
Did they do this to you?

448
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:19,704
What do you want?

449
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:21,272
Baby, what happened?

450
00:47:21,272 --> 00:47:23,774
I stepped on the glass.

Shit.

452
00:47:34,752 --> 00:47:37,155
We just gotta get your

00:47:37,155 --> 00:47:38,589
Oh my god.

454
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,427
Why are they doing this?

I don't know.

456
00:47:43,061 --> 00:47:44,262
I don't know.

457
00:47:47,765 --> 00:47:48,799
Just breathe.

I need to make sure we
can get to the car.

00:49:13,351 --> 00:49:14,252
No, please.

492
00:49:14,252 --> 00:49:15,320

01:03:21,765 --> 01:03:22,766
Hey.

577
01:03:22,766 --> 01:03:23,934
Rachel's down.

578
01:03:23,934 --> 01:03:25,702
Grab another mask...

579
01:03:32,843 --> 01:03:34,278
Because we need it.

580
01:04:24,028 --> 01:04:27,464
I can't believe you let
her into our house.

581
01:04:27,464 --> 01:04:28,332
What?

582
01:04:28,332 --> 01:04:29,199
And you told her about us.

583
01:04:29,199 --> 01:04:30,867
I had to talk to somebody.

584
01:04:30,867 --> 01:04:32,236
Then talk to me.

585
01:04:32,236 --> 01:04:33,603
You're too fucked up on booze
to talk about anything.

586
01:04:33,603 --> 01:04:36,073
If you wouldn't have dragged
us away from the city, I

587
01:04:36,073 --> 01:04:38,742
wouldn't have had to bury
myself with him.

588
01:04:38,742 --> 01:04:41,378
What, in the cellar?

589
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:43,313
I saw it, Addie.

590
01:04:43,313 --> 01:04:45,182
I fucking saw it.

591
01:04:45,182 --> 01:04:48,018
You want to know why I
can't talk about him?

592
01:04:48,018 --> 01:04:51,121
Because I was there, Jonathan.

593
01:04:51,121 --> 01:04:54,124
I put him down, I turned on that
fucking monitor, I looked

594
01:04:54,124 --> 01:04:57,494
up, and then he was gone.

595
01:04:57,494 --> 01:05:02,399
I went into the water, I pulled
him out, but I was too

596
01:05:02,399 --> 01:05:03,833
fucking late.

597
01:05:06,070 --> 01:05:09,506
You were supposed to
be watching him.

598
01:05:09,506 --> 01:05:10,807
Do you think...

599
01:05:10,807 --> 01:05:13,843
Do you really think that you're
the only one going

600
01:05:13,843 --> 01:05:15,079
through this?

601
01:05:15,079 --> 01:05:17,414
This happened to me, too.

602
01:05:17,414 --> 01:05:20,951
I lost my son too.

603
01:05:20,951 --> 01:05:23,954
You think I don't want
more time with him?

604
01:05:23,954 --> 01:05:27,424
More time with us?

605
01:05:27,424 --> 01:05:30,360
I want him back, Addie.

606
01:05:30,360 --> 01:05:31,261
I want him back.

607
01:05:31,261 --> 01:05:33,330
I want us back.

608
01:05:33,330 --> 01:05:36,333
You're my wife.

609
01:05:36,333 --> 01:05:38,268
That's all I want.

610
01:05:38,268 --> 01:05:41,805
This is all I want.

611
01:05:41,805 --> 01:05:43,240
I want that too.

612
01:05:57,454 --> 01:05:59,456
He's never gonna leave us.

613
01:06:06,896 --> 01:06:08,565
I'm going to go get
Rachel's car.

614
01:06:08,565 --> 01:06:10,734
It's the only chance
we've got.

615
01:06:33,057 --> 01:06:34,291
Shh.

616
01:07:15,065 --> 01:07:16,300
[bump]

617
01:07:20,604 --> 01:07:31,615

01:07:31,615 --> 01:07:32,616

622
01:08:03,046 --> 01:08:15,159
[whirring]

623
01:08:22,532 --> 01:08:23,500
No.

624
01:08:23,500 --> 01:08:25,935
No, no, no, no, no.

625
01:08:25,935 --> 01:08:27,904
[screaming]

626
01:08:42,519 --> 01:08:43,953
Addie?

627
01:10:38,201 --> 01:10:41,237
Doesn't work.

628
01:10:41,237 --> 01:10:44,140
You! You.

629
01:10:47,811 --> 01:10:49,413
Jesus Christ.

630
01:10:49,413 --> 01:10:50,647
What did they do to you?

631
01:10:53,717 --> 01:10:54,284
Tell him.

632
01:10:54,284 --> 01:10:55,519
Shut up!

633
01:10:58,154 --> 01:10:59,389
Get up, baby.

634
01:11:04,227 --> 01:11:05,595
Addie, we gotta go, baby.

635
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:07,030
Come on.

636
01:11:13,102 --> 01:11:14,504
Don't fucking move!

637
01:11:22,379 --> 01:11:23,580
Jesus fucking Christ, baby.

638
01:11:23,580 --> 01:11:25,114
We gotta go.

639
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:26,516
We don't have to
pretend anymore.

640
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:33,690
I'm so sorry.

641
01:11:33,690 --> 01:11:35,859
You didn't do anything wrong.

642
01:11:35,859 --> 01:11:37,293
It's not your fault.

643
01:11:37,293 --> 01:11:39,295
I'm so sorry.

644
01:11:39,295 --> 01:11:40,764
It was.

645
01:11:40,764 --> 01:11:42,298
It is.

646
01:11:42,298 --> 01:11:43,833
It's OK.

647
01:11:43,833 --> 01:11:45,402
You were holding him.

648
01:11:49,205 --> 01:11:55,345
His head was just dangled
over your shoulder.

649
01:11:58,848 --> 01:12:02,386
And I was so angry, Jonathan.

650
01:12:02,386 --> 01:12:03,620
I was so angry.

651
01:12:06,155 --> 01:12:07,557
And I hated you.

652
01:12:10,394 --> 01:12:12,629
I hate you so much.

653
01:12:15,298 --> 01:12:19,403
But I hated myself
even more, so I...

654
01:12:19,403 --> 01:12:25,709
I went to your office
and I got your gun.

655
01:12:25,709 --> 01:12:27,377
That's why you couldn't
find it.

656
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:32,115
And I took it to myself.

657
01:12:38,187 --> 01:12:39,423
And I pulled the trigger.

658
01:12:46,295 --> 01:12:47,531
Before I did...

659
01:13:03,379 --> 01:13:05,181
I'm sorry.

660
01:13:12,456 --> 01:13:14,824
Sorry.

661
01:13:14,824 --> 01:13:17,427
I'm so sorry.

662
01:13:17,427 --> 01:13:18,862
It's OK.

663
01:13:24,367 --> 01:13:25,602
It's OK.

664
01:14:17,587 --> 01:14:18,421
We...

665
01:14:18,421 --> 01:14:19,122
We'll...

666
01:14:19,122 --> 01:14:19,689
I'll fix this, OK?

667
01:14:19,689 --> 01:14:20,757
I promise.

668
01:14:20,757 --> 01:14:22,191
I'll fix this.

669
01:14:28,598 --> 01:14:30,233
Hey.

670
01:14:32,536 --> 01:14:34,203
What happened to my house?

671
01:14:38,007 --> 01:14:39,543
They fought really hard.

672
01:14:42,746 --> 01:14:44,748
You never know how
it's gonna go.

673
01:14:44,748 --> 01:14:46,382
Yeah.

674
01:14:51,487 --> 01:14:53,422
She doesn't need a...

675
01:14:53,422 --> 01:14:54,658
To see them?

676
01:14:59,696 --> 01:15:01,330
Wow.

677
01:15:09,438 --> 01:15:14,277
Uh, how do I know
they're gone?

678
01:15:22,952 --> 01:15:24,387
How do you do it?

679
01:15:33,897 --> 01:15:35,331
You make contact.

680
01:15:37,567 --> 01:15:40,103
Hi.

681
01:15:40,103 --> 01:15:41,337
You OK?

682
01:15:43,472 --> 01:15:46,342
RACHEL (OFFSCREEN): Get them
to confront their trauma.

683
01:15:51,380 --> 01:15:55,418
They need to be put in a
constant state of terror.

684
01:15:57,654 --> 01:16:01,490
Taken to the same emotional
place that they were in at the

685
01:16:01,490 --> 01:16:03,860
time of death.

686
01:16:03,860 --> 01:16:05,294
What do you want?

687
01:16:06,730 --> 01:16:08,598
Before they can forgive
each other.

688
01:16:08,598 --> 01:16:11,467
We're gonna get through
this together.

689
01:16:11,467 --> 01:16:12,702
I want him back.

690
01:16:12,702 --> 01:16:15,404
I want us back.

691
01:16:15,404 --> 01:16:16,439
You're my wife.

692
01:16:18,875 --> 01:16:21,444
And accept that they're gone.

693
01:16:27,183 --> 01:16:35,324
And once they do, they
finally let go.

694
01:16:40,496 --> 01:16:54,343
