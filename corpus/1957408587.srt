1
00:00:00,497 --> 00:00:04,080
(elegant orchestral music)

2
00:00:09,010 --> 00:00:12,260
(office muzak)

3
00:00:12,260 --> 00:00:14,380
(sighs)

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:16,160
- This is a good film.

5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:17,980
They're gonna love it.

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:18,830
It's a good film.

7
00:00:21,542 --> 00:00:22,375
(door clacks)

8
00:00:22,375 --> 00:00:23,670
- [Sir Max] Thank you
for your presentation.

9
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,243
We will review your materials carefully

10
00:00:25,243 --> 00:00:26,955
and let you know our
decision within four weeks.

11
00:00:26,955 --> 00:00:28,679
Thank you. Goodbye.

12
00:00:30,940 --> 00:00:32,743
- [Announcer] You can go in now, Mr. Sand.

13
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:34,643
- Thank you.

14
00:00:39,241 --> 00:00:43,120
- Well, well, look who
darkens our door yet again.

15
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:44,938
George Sand.

16
00:00:44,938 --> 00:00:45,771
Take a seat.

17
00:00:45,771 --> 00:00:48,200
- [Sir Max] Mr. Sand, Mr. Sand, Mr. Sand.

18
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,830
Another documentary, I take it?

19
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:50,797
- Yes, sir.

20
00:00:50,797 --> 00:00:53,320
- And you require
finishing funds, no doubt?

21
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:55,260
- Yes, sir.
- Mr. Sand, you realize that

22
00:00:55,260 --> 00:00:56,750
if you are turned down one more time,

23
00:00:56,750 --> 00:01:00,543
you will never again be able
to approach the BBC for funds.

24
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:02,780
Ever.

25
00:01:02,780 --> 00:01:04,530
- Why don't you take a few days

26
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:06,060
to decide if this is really--

27
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:07,920
- No, I want to do this now.

28
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,442
I believe this project will
make my name as a filmmaker.

29
00:01:10,442 --> 00:01:11,650
(Rugglesworth sighs)

30
00:01:11,650 --> 00:01:13,330
- A last ditch stand for art.

31
00:01:13,330 --> 00:01:14,750
Superb.

32
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:15,840
But let me remind you, Mr. Sand,

33
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,720
some filmmakers are born, some are made,

34
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:18,920
and some are neither.

35
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:20,160
- You have one hour, Mr. Sand,

36
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:21,530
though more or less time may be granted

37
00:01:21,530 --> 00:01:24,063
at the discretion of the
committee, so proceed.

38
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:25,873
- Okay.

39
00:01:25,873 --> 00:01:28,360
Well, last summer, my
partner and I decided to make

40
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:30,960
a short film about a new
American film festival.

41
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,610
- A film about filmmaking.

42
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:33,683
How thrilling.

43
00:01:35,155 --> 00:01:36,020
- What we didn't know

44
00:01:36,020 --> 00:01:39,290
was that though we'd come
to document a film festival,

45
00:01:39,290 --> 00:01:41,180
we were soon to find ourselves enmeshed

46
00:01:41,180 --> 00:01:43,363
in something much, much bigger.

47
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:50,850
- So are we done here?

48
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,750
- No, I'm finding myself enmeshed

49
00:01:52,750 --> 00:01:54,787
in something much, much bigger.

50
00:01:56,225 --> 00:01:58,276
- Oh.

51
00:01:58,276 --> 00:02:02,276
(apprehensive orchestral music)

52
00:02:56,828 --> 00:02:59,411
(brassy thriller music)

53
00:03:24,116 --> 00:03:27,004
- [George Voiceover] It
all began with a film.

54
00:03:27,004 --> 00:03:30,519
(Ingemar groaning)

55
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:34,436
- Ingemar, do not shuffle
off this mortal coil!

56
00:03:35,610 --> 00:03:37,673
Do not go gently into that good night!

57
00:03:38,741 --> 00:03:40,839
Oh, no!

58
00:03:40,839 --> 00:03:41,672
Ingemar!

59
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:43,783
Ingemar!

60
00:03:44,795 --> 00:03:45,628
Ingemar!

61
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:51,527
Oh, why do you take the
road less traveled?!

62
00:03:52,870 --> 00:03:53,703
Why?!

63
00:03:56,269 --> 00:03:58,980
(Jules crying)

64
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:00,650
- Hey, what's up, dude?

65
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:01,800
- Who the hell are you?

66
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:04,373
- I'm God, man.

67
00:04:08,230 --> 00:04:12,410
- Listen, my friend
Ingemar just died here,

68
00:04:12,410 --> 00:04:13,450
do you think you could bring him back?

69
00:04:13,450 --> 00:04:14,650
He's a really good dude.

70
00:04:16,090 --> 00:04:21,090
- Well, I really shouldn't,
but what the hell.

71
00:04:22,743 --> 00:04:23,977
(fingers snap)
(neck cracks)

72
00:04:23,977 --> 00:04:26,727
(Ingemar groans)

73
00:04:27,766 --> 00:04:28,877
(Jules laughs)

74
00:04:28,877 --> 00:04:30,200
- Oh, bitchin'!

75
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:31,033
Oh, hey, God!

76
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:33,873
Thanks, man.

77
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,853
God is a totally awesome dude.

78
00:04:43,662 --> 00:04:45,912
(laughing)

79
00:04:46,850 --> 00:04:49,708
- You know, I've changed my mind.

80
00:04:49,708 --> 00:04:54,450
(fingers snap)
(neck cracks)

81
00:04:54,450 --> 00:04:55,603
- You can't do this.

82
00:04:57,980 --> 00:05:00,573
- What do you mean I can't do this?

83
00:05:03,830 --> 00:05:04,663
- You're right.

84
00:05:05,530 --> 00:05:06,453
I'm sorry, God.

85
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:09,233
- Well, I'm sorry, too, Jules.

86
00:05:10,805 --> 00:05:11,638
(fingers snap)

87
00:05:11,638 --> 00:05:14,910
(neck cracks)
(Ingemar groans)

88
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:15,893
I'm real sorry.

89
00:05:16,825 --> 00:05:17,908
(fingers snap)

90
00:05:17,908 --> 00:05:20,575
(Jules gurgles)

91
00:05:24,597 --> 00:05:28,415
(hyper-dramatic orchestral music)

92
00:05:28,415 --> 00:05:29,248
- Jules!

93
00:05:31,084 --> 00:05:31,917
Jules!

94
00:05:32,845 --> 00:05:33,678
Jules!

95
00:05:35,478 --> 00:05:36,311
Jules!

96
00:05:46,857 --> 00:05:49,397
(film projector clicking)

97
00:05:49,397 --> 00:05:52,397
(audience applauds)

98
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,270
- Thank you.

99
00:05:55,270 --> 00:05:57,220
I am Arthur Wong.

100
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:00,760
That film, entitled
The Crap Shoot of Life,

101
00:06:00,760 --> 00:06:04,480
was directed by my son,
the late Mike Wong,

102
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:06,650
who also played God in the film.

103
00:06:06,650 --> 00:06:09,440
- Arthur Wong, the world's
foremost expert on elephants,

104
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,190
had started the festival the year before

105
00:06:11,190 --> 00:06:14,290
in honor of his son Mike, who
had died while in film school.

106
00:06:14,290 --> 00:06:17,580
10 finalists had been selected
from Mike's classmates.

107
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:18,920
Their short films were to be screened

108
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:20,720
over the course of the next few evenings,

109
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:22,370
after which the winner would be announced.

110
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:25,330
First prize for the festival was $70,000,

111
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,200
which would have to be used
to make a feature film.

112
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,360
- A feature film for 70,000?

113
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:31,440
Preposterous.
- Oh, yes, yes, it's possible,

114
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,130
Rugglesworth, but you
get what you pay for.

115
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:37,660
- Now, let me introduce my fellow judges.

116
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,000
We're very fortunate to
have with us, the reclusive,

117
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,796
unfairly-maligned Irish
director Siobhan Meehan.

118
00:06:44,796 --> 00:06:46,690
(audience applauds)

119
00:06:46,690 --> 00:06:49,110
Her films include Proletarian Clover,

120
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,130
The Black Swan of Trespass,
and Forever Barney.

121
00:06:53,130 --> 00:06:55,700
- That's Forever Blarney.

122
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:56,560
- Pardon me.

123
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,460
Forever Blarney.

124
00:06:58,460 --> 00:07:00,250
Our other judge is Elliot Lewis,

125
00:07:00,250 --> 00:07:02,379
who was the winner of
last year's festival.

126
00:07:02,379 --> 00:07:04,290
(audience applauds)

127
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:06,020
Elliot's film, for those of you

128
00:07:06,020 --> 00:07:09,886
who do not have the memory
of an elephant, (chuckles)

129
00:07:09,886 --> 00:07:14,380
was a brilliant piece of
reenactment, or as Elliot prefers,

130
00:07:14,380 --> 00:07:17,870
evocation of the Kennedy assassination,

131
00:07:17,870 --> 00:07:20,670
performed by a talented
cast of eight-year-olds.

132
00:07:20,670 --> 00:07:23,372
Elliot is also here, of
course, to show us the film

133
00:07:23,372 --> 00:07:26,130
that he made with last year's prize money.

134
00:07:26,130 --> 00:07:28,830
We're all looking forward
to seeing your film, Elliot.

135
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:31,240
Now, without further ado,

136
00:07:31,240 --> 00:07:34,870
let me introduce our first finalist.

137
00:07:34,870 --> 00:07:38,390
Her name is Maria Hernandez
from Darian, Connecticut,

138
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,481
and her film is Street Poetry.

139
00:07:40,481 --> 00:07:43,481
(audience applauds)

140
00:07:45,799 --> 00:07:47,716
- It's (Spanish accent) Maria Hernandez.

141
00:07:49,386 --> 00:07:52,027
(audience applauds)

142
00:07:52,027 --> 00:07:54,733
And it's Darien, Connecticut.

143
00:07:55,854 --> 00:07:58,854
(audience applauds)

144
00:08:01,301 --> 00:08:02,292
(film projector clicking)

145
00:08:02,292 --> 00:08:03,280
- Come on.

146
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:04,953
- [Latina Woman] On the
streets of Spanish Harlem,

147
00:08:04,953 --> 00:08:06,965
you can't expect nothing from nobody.

148
00:08:06,965 --> 00:08:09,340
Even if you're a Nobel Prize-winning poet.

149
00:08:09,340 --> 00:08:10,330
- Okay.

150
00:08:10,330 --> 00:08:12,643
I think we should, um, Tori?

151
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:16,880
Tori?
- Uh, yeah?

152
00:08:16,880 --> 00:08:18,740
- I think we should concentrate
on getting some interviews

153
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:20,280
with the filmmakers and the judges, okay?

154
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:22,080
Now, do you have the
mic you want for that?

155
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:23,770
- Uh, yeah.

156
00:08:23,770 --> 00:08:24,926
One sec.

157
00:08:24,926 --> 00:08:26,860
(door clacks)

158
00:08:26,860 --> 00:08:27,693
- Excuse me.

159
00:08:29,290 --> 00:08:30,780
Oh, I'm terribly sorry.

160
00:08:30,780 --> 00:08:32,590
My name's George Sand, and--

161
00:08:32,590 --> 00:08:33,750
- George Sand?

162
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:35,160
- [George] Yes, I'm
shooting a documentary--

163
00:08:35,160 --> 00:08:36,310
- For real?

164
00:08:36,310 --> 00:08:37,143
- Yes.

165
00:08:37,143 --> 00:08:39,090
I'm shooting a documentary
about this film festival,

166
00:08:39,090 --> 00:08:40,780
and I wonder if I might be allowed

167
00:08:40,780 --> 00:08:43,420
to ask you a few questions on camera?

168
00:08:43,420 --> 00:08:44,253
- Video.

169
00:08:45,250 --> 00:08:49,930
Listen, this is a film
festival, not a video festival.

170
00:08:49,930 --> 00:08:52,280
If you want to interview
me, get a film camera.

171
00:08:57,330 --> 00:09:00,320
- Moving along, our second finalist

172
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:03,043
is William Butler of Perth, Australia.

173
00:09:03,043 --> 00:09:06,043
(audience applauds)

174
00:09:07,590 --> 00:09:11,453
- 38% of all soccer players are gay.

175
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:17,754
22% of them are forced
to play out of position.

176
00:09:17,754 --> 00:09:19,211
- Yeah!
- That's right.

177
00:09:19,211 --> 00:09:22,150
- And that is terribly wrong.

178
00:09:22,150 --> 00:09:25,150
(audience applauds)

179
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,930
- Well, this is all very
riveting stuff, Mr. Sand,

180
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,100
but can we hope that something
will actually transpire

181
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:35,273
in the near future?

182
00:09:36,780 --> 00:09:39,800
- Well, the next morning,
I went for a pleasant jog.

183
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,900
Little did I suspect

184
00:09:40,900 --> 00:09:43,433
the dramatic turn events
were about to take.

185
00:09:51,054 --> 00:09:53,637
(chase music)

186
00:10:01,685 --> 00:10:06,685
- [Radio Dispatcher] 78.5, code
6, 105 northbound, route 52.

187
00:10:08,342 --> 00:10:11,148
(police radio chattering)

188
00:10:11,148 --> 00:10:11,981
- Poor girl.

189
00:10:11,981 --> 00:10:13,470
- Who is it?

190
00:10:13,470 --> 00:10:15,040
- Maria Hernandez.

191
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:15,930
- What happened to her?

192
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:17,970
- Strangled with her own silk scarf.

193
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:18,803
- Really?

194
00:10:18,803 --> 00:10:21,220
- And the grotesque
thing is that the scarf

195
00:10:21,220 --> 00:10:22,801
had an elephant design on it.

196
00:10:22,801 --> 00:10:23,634
- What?

197
00:10:23,634 --> 00:10:24,633
- Horrible, isn't it?

198
00:10:25,722 --> 00:10:26,660
- Yes.

199
00:10:26,660 --> 00:10:27,907
Terrible.

200
00:10:27,907 --> 00:10:29,457
- Did the police catch the guy?

201
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:31,233
- No.

202
00:10:32,260 --> 00:10:35,710
It seems to be an act of
random urban violence.

203
00:10:35,710 --> 00:10:39,060
Oh, by the way, this is Rosemary Olsen,

204
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,143
our only undergraduate finalist.

205
00:10:44,080 --> 00:10:46,903
Well, I'd better call
the poor girl's family.

206
00:10:47,940 --> 00:10:49,840
I know what it's like to lose a child.

207
00:10:53,540 --> 00:10:55,113
- How did his son die?

208
00:10:55,113 --> 00:10:56,690
- Who? Mike?

209
00:10:56,690 --> 00:10:59,640
Died while we were shooting
The Crap Shoot of Life.

210
00:10:59,640 --> 00:11:01,230
Terrible accident.

211
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:03,430
- All of you finalists
were in Mike's class?

212
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:06,310
- I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.

213
00:11:06,310 --> 00:11:07,410
- Oh, George Sand.

214
00:11:07,410 --> 00:11:08,777
I'm doing a documentary about the festival

215
00:11:08,777 --> 00:11:11,110
and the filmmakers, see
what makes you tick,

216
00:11:11,110 --> 00:11:12,660
why you made the films you did.

217
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:17,453
- Sometimes we don't make
the films, films make us.

218
00:11:20,052 --> 00:11:22,610
- "The films make us"?

219
00:11:22,610 --> 00:11:25,990
People don't actually talk that
way in real life, Mr. Sand.

220
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,480
- Rosemary did.

221
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:30,783
She was like a mysterious,
dangerous flower.

222
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:34,920
Of course I was curious
about her work, but her film,

223
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:37,250
unfortunately, was not
scheduled until the final night.

224
00:11:37,250 --> 00:11:38,800
- That is unfortunate,

225
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,453
since I doubt we'll actually
reach the final night.

226
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:43,710
- I returned to the crime scene

227
00:11:43,710 --> 00:11:45,653
a little later with my camera.

228
00:11:47,266 --> 00:11:50,766
(police radio chattering)

229
00:11:54,210 --> 00:11:57,170
- I'm Detective Blank, in
charge of this investigation.

230
00:11:57,170 --> 00:11:58,540
Your name, please.

231
00:11:58,540 --> 00:12:00,630
- George Sand.
- Spell that, please.

232
00:12:00,630 --> 00:12:01,660
- Which part?

233
00:12:01,660 --> 00:12:03,030
- Don't play games with me, Mr. Sand.

234
00:12:03,030 --> 00:12:05,440
- Um, S-A-N-D.

235
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:07,250
- I know how to spell Sand.

236
00:12:07,250 --> 00:12:08,083
- Sorry.

237
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:08,916
G-E-O-R--

238
00:12:08,916 --> 00:12:10,040
- Slowly.

239
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:10,873
- G.
- G.

240
00:12:10,873 --> 00:12:11,706
- E.
- Hold on, hold on.

241
00:12:11,706 --> 00:12:14,930
G-E.
- E-O-R-G-E.

242
00:12:14,930 --> 00:12:16,210
- Thank you.

243
00:12:16,210 --> 00:12:17,330
Occupation.

244
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:18,890
- Documentary filmmaker.

245
00:12:18,890 --> 00:12:19,723
- Really?

246
00:12:21,170 --> 00:12:22,003
Favorite film.

247
00:12:22,865 --> 00:12:25,090
- I don't really see how that's relevant.

248
00:12:25,090 --> 00:12:26,460
- Suit yourself, Mr. Sand,

249
00:12:26,460 --> 00:12:28,930
but one thing you can be sure of,

250
00:12:28,930 --> 00:12:31,650
I'll find out, one way or another.

251
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,500
- That evening's finalists
were two ambitious Europeans,

252
00:12:40,500 --> 00:12:43,840
one was Giscard Gateau, a Frenchman,

253
00:12:43,840 --> 00:12:47,620
the other, Paradiso Marcopoli, an Italian,

254
00:12:47,620 --> 00:12:48,670
both of whom were kind enough

255
00:12:48,670 --> 00:12:51,170
to provide promotional head shots.

256
00:12:51,170 --> 00:12:52,500
Watching Giscard's film,

257
00:12:52,500 --> 00:12:57,010
entitled Young and Hungry in
New York, was rather unnerving.

258
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:58,520
Somehow, I wasn't sure I liked

259
00:12:58,520 --> 00:13:02,178
what this film told me
about Giscard Gateau.

260
00:13:02,178 --> 00:13:05,178
(urban jazz music)

261
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:54,520
Next was Paradiso's film,

262
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,850
which made me realize how much films

263
00:13:55,850 --> 00:13:57,600
tend to resemble their directors,

264
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:00,000
the way that dogs seem
to resemble their owners.

265
00:14:01,022 --> 00:14:06,022
(woman vocalizing)
(gentle guitar music)

266
00:14:27,220 --> 00:14:28,270
- Cut it.

267
00:14:28,270 --> 00:14:29,123
We've got enough.

268
00:14:32,670 --> 00:14:35,620
- Sir Max, I'm feeling a bit nauseous.

269
00:14:35,620 --> 00:14:37,473
Feel free to continue without me.

270
00:14:39,490 --> 00:14:40,460
- Yes.

271
00:14:40,460 --> 00:14:41,410
I'll come with you.

272
00:14:45,860 --> 00:14:48,430
- I think it's going
rather well, don't you?

273
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:50,010
I mean, they have some
concerns, of course,

274
00:14:50,010 --> 00:14:51,670
but I think I've addressed them.

275
00:14:51,670 --> 00:14:52,503
- George.

276
00:14:53,362 --> 00:14:56,623
Does the word Waterloo
mean anything to you?

277
00:14:57,490 --> 00:14:58,323
- Waterloo?

278
00:14:58,323 --> 00:15:02,860
- How about "debacle" or
"hideous unnatural misbirth"?

279
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:05,380
The murder was good.

280
00:15:05,380 --> 00:15:07,230
- It was?
- Oh, yes, very good.

281
00:15:07,230 --> 00:15:08,620
If you have anything else like that,

282
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,633
please use it before it's too late.

283
00:15:11,520 --> 00:15:15,115
Or, even better, a good sex scene.

284
00:15:15,115 --> 00:15:16,486
(door clacks)

285
00:15:16,486 --> 00:15:17,600
- Thank you for your
presentation, Mr. Sand,

286
00:15:17,600 --> 00:15:19,870
we shall review your materials carefully--

287
00:15:19,870 --> 00:15:22,070
- And as Tori and I
walked out into the lobby,

288
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:23,775
we heard a shocking sound.

289
00:15:23,775 --> 00:15:25,010
(gun fires)

290
00:15:25,010 --> 00:15:26,700
- A shocking sound?

291
00:15:26,700 --> 00:15:28,058
- A terrifying sound!

292
00:15:28,058 --> 00:15:30,975
(gun fires loudly)

293
00:15:35,453 --> 00:15:36,286
Roll, Tori.

294
00:15:36,286 --> 00:15:37,883
Roll camera.

295
00:15:37,883 --> 00:15:38,752
- [Tori] Who is it?

296
00:15:38,752 --> 00:15:40,051
- It's William Butler.

297
00:15:40,051 --> 00:15:44,358
- [Tori] Oh, the gay
Australian soccer player.

298
00:15:44,358 --> 00:15:47,371
- No, his film was about a
gay Australian soccer player.

299
00:15:47,371 --> 00:15:48,871
- [Tori] Whatever.

300
00:15:49,863 --> 00:15:51,006
- You can cut the camera.

301
00:15:51,006 --> 00:15:52,842
- [Tori] I don't wanna.

302
00:15:52,842 --> 00:15:54,933
- You probably did this
to interrupt my film!

303
00:15:54,933 --> 00:15:56,690
You know I am going to win!

304
00:15:56,690 --> 00:15:59,190
- I did not, but I do
feel pity for the audience

305
00:15:59,190 --> 00:16:01,990
that is forced to watch
your pathetic little film.

306
00:16:01,990 --> 00:16:04,353
- Gentlemen, this is
not a time for argument.

307
00:16:06,950 --> 00:16:08,740
- You are correct, of course.

308
00:16:08,740 --> 00:16:10,300
My apologies.

309
00:16:10,300 --> 00:16:11,970
- I, also, apologize.

310
00:16:11,970 --> 00:16:14,093
Now, can we resume my film?

311
00:16:15,910 --> 00:16:17,720
- Seems like an awfully big coincidence,

312
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:19,753
two filmmakers dead in two days.

313
00:16:20,940 --> 00:16:22,280
- Maybe somebody killed them

314
00:16:22,280 --> 00:16:24,443
because they didn't like their films.

315
00:16:25,375 --> 00:16:26,675
- I have a similar theory.

316
00:16:28,150 --> 00:16:30,050
Perhaps I'll share it with the police.

317
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,350
- They're experts, let them handle it.

318
00:16:33,350 --> 00:16:34,510
- Those who've seen my films,

319
00:16:34,510 --> 00:16:37,260
consider me something of an
expert on the human psyche.

320
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:52,683
Rosemary!

321
00:16:52,683 --> 00:16:54,420
- If it isn't George Sand,

322
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:56,590
documentarian to the future stars.

323
00:16:56,590 --> 00:16:59,030
- Thank you, it's always
nice to be condescended to

324
00:16:59,030 --> 00:17:00,860
at the beginning of a conversation.

325
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:01,800
- Sorry.

326
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,250
Guess I'm not used to people who realize

327
00:17:03,250 --> 00:17:04,083
they're being insulted.

328
00:17:04,083 --> 00:17:05,740
- Oh, that's okay.

329
00:17:05,740 --> 00:17:09,400
I'm the same way with my
partner Tori, Mr. Five Percent.

330
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:10,953
- Why do you call him Mr. Five Percent?

331
00:17:10,953 --> 00:17:13,853
- Because the average
human uses 9% of his brain.

332
00:17:15,410 --> 00:17:16,563
- [Rosemary] Let's sit down.

333
00:17:22,562 --> 00:17:25,145
(gentle music)

334
00:17:29,890 --> 00:17:31,413
- What was that about?

335
00:17:35,070 --> 00:17:37,180
- Just calming myself down a bit.

336
00:17:37,180 --> 00:17:39,270
I'm a follower of Barkley.

337
00:17:39,270 --> 00:17:40,360
- Charles?

338
00:17:40,360 --> 00:17:42,856
- No, Bishop Berkeley.

339
00:17:42,856 --> 00:17:46,530
I believe that if I close
my eyes, you cease to exist.

340
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:47,730
- Excuse me?

341
00:17:47,730 --> 00:17:51,120
- When I close my eyes,
that tree, this park,

342
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,700
and all the people in
it just cease to exist.

343
00:17:53,700 --> 00:17:55,800
When I open them, you all reappear.

344
00:17:55,800 --> 00:17:58,180
- That is the most
self-centered philosophy

345
00:17:58,180 --> 00:17:59,920
I have ever heard.

346
00:17:59,920 --> 00:18:01,870
- Gets me through the day.

347
00:18:01,870 --> 00:18:03,670
- Well, can you open your eyes?

348
00:18:03,670 --> 00:18:06,613
I'm getting a bit tired of
blinking in and out of existence.

349
00:18:10,323 --> 00:18:12,793
- The stars are so beautiful.

350
00:18:12,793 --> 00:18:15,290
It's too bad they don't really exist.

351
00:18:15,290 --> 00:18:17,493
- Well, it's true that the
light we see from those stars

352
00:18:17,493 --> 00:18:19,053
was emitted years ago.

353
00:18:19,053 --> 00:18:20,420
- So that means if a star exploded

354
00:18:20,420 --> 00:18:22,460
and killed millions of people,

355
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:24,833
we wouldn't know about it for years?

356
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:25,990
- I don't know, you'd have to ask

357
00:18:25,990 --> 00:18:27,437
Albert Einstein about that.

358
00:18:27,437 --> 00:18:28,270
- Did you know that Albert Einstein's

359
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:30,010
first child was a baby girl,

360
00:18:30,010 --> 00:18:31,130
who he gave up for adoption

361
00:18:31,130 --> 00:18:33,100
because he and the mother weren't married?

362
00:18:33,100 --> 00:18:34,611
- Yes.

363
00:18:34,611 --> 00:18:35,944
- You knew that?

364
00:18:37,408 --> 00:18:40,281
Did you know that that baby
grew up to be Amelia Earhart?

365
00:18:40,281 --> 00:18:41,330
- That, I did not know.

366
00:18:41,330 --> 00:18:42,890
- Yeah, and she wasn't killed.

367
00:18:42,890 --> 00:18:44,590
She used her father's
theories to create a hole

368
00:18:44,590 --> 00:18:46,950
in the space-time continuum,
and just flew through it.

369
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:47,783
- Fascinating.

370
00:18:47,783 --> 00:18:48,720
Where did she go to?

371
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,790
- Well, that would be pure speculation.

372
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:54,810
I have to go.

373
00:18:54,810 --> 00:18:55,643
- Rosemary?

374
00:18:57,528 --> 00:18:59,112
Be careful.

375
00:18:59,112 --> 00:19:00,760
- Why?

376
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:02,823
- One dead filmmaker is an anomaly.

377
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:04,523
Two is a trend.

378
00:19:06,790 --> 00:19:08,490
- Thanks for your concern.

379
00:19:08,490 --> 00:19:09,590
It's kind of shocking.

380
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,853
- Not even a little kiss?

381
00:19:18,810 --> 00:19:19,643
- Uh, no.

382
00:19:21,438 --> 00:19:22,438
- Well, maybe later.

383
00:19:23,410 --> 00:19:24,583
- Yes, maybe later.

384
00:19:25,490 --> 00:19:27,440
- Many of the documentaries we finance

385
00:19:27,440 --> 00:19:30,140
do have sexual content.

386
00:19:30,140 --> 00:19:31,410
- Right.

387
00:19:31,410 --> 00:19:34,860
Anyway, when I got home, I
read up on Bishop Berkeley,

388
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:36,980
Albert Einstein, and Amelia Earhart,

389
00:19:36,980 --> 00:19:38,730
after which I studied
the promotional material

390
00:19:38,730 --> 00:19:40,700
on the other finalists,
which I'd just received.

391
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:43,340
There was Asmali Jawad from Bombay, India,

392
00:19:43,340 --> 00:19:46,150
Carmela Cicero Maresca
from British Columbia,

393
00:19:46,150 --> 00:19:48,880
Spike Levy from Williamsburg, Brooklyn,

394
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:51,760
Sasha Swann from Orange
County, California,

395
00:19:51,760 --> 00:19:55,303
and the Unknown Filmmaker, origin unknown.

396
00:19:56,590 --> 00:19:58,537
- In that Apache Indian song, does he say,

397
00:19:58,537 --> 00:20:01,525
"High class, low class,
middle class, no class,"

398
00:20:01,525 --> 00:20:02,878
or does he say, "High class, no class,

399
00:20:02,878 --> 00:20:03,711
"middle class, no class"?

400
00:20:04,670 --> 00:20:05,503
- I'm fairly certain he says--

401
00:20:05,503 --> 00:20:07,240
- [George Voiceover] Watching
this film, it seemed to me

402
00:20:07,240 --> 00:20:09,820
that there was a certain truth in fiction,

403
00:20:09,820 --> 00:20:11,600
that in every film there
was something of the essence

404
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,660
of its creator, of its
auteur, if you will.

405
00:20:15,660 --> 00:20:16,493
- Ah.

406
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:19,853
- Ready?

407
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:28,810
- Curious, is it not, how
some people refuse to learn

408
00:20:28,810 --> 00:20:31,690
the appropriate lesson
until it is too late, yes?

409
00:20:31,690 --> 00:20:32,523
- Yes.

410
00:20:34,440 --> 00:20:37,220
- Have you read the Upanishad of Shiva?

411
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:39,160
- Chapter 25, verse 17.

412
00:20:39,160 --> 00:20:41,340
And they shall pay for
what they have done,

413
00:20:41,340 --> 00:20:45,053
for Shiva shall always exact
a fair price in justice.

414
00:20:45,950 --> 00:20:47,350
Do you know what this means?

415
00:20:49,370 --> 00:20:51,997
Well, we will show you.

416
00:20:54,312 --> 00:20:55,217
(guns clacking)

417
00:20:55,217 --> 00:20:57,717
(guns firing)

418
00:21:06,577 --> 00:21:09,475
(Indian pop music)

419
00:21:09,475 --> 00:21:10,900
- Would you care to come over tonight?

420
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:13,070
My wife is preparing dal makhani.

421
00:21:13,070 --> 00:21:14,650
- That sounds lovely.

422
00:21:14,650 --> 00:21:16,590
Say, do you know what
they call dal makhani

423
00:21:16,590 --> 00:21:17,620
in the United States?

424
00:21:17,620 --> 00:21:18,453
- I don't know.

425
00:21:18,453 --> 00:21:20,517
- I believe that they simply call it

426
00:21:20,517 --> 00:21:22,183
Dal.

427
00:21:22,183 --> 00:21:24,457
(audience applauds)

428
00:21:24,457 --> 00:21:27,540
- Ladies and gentlemen, Asmali Jawad.

429
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,330
Next is our north of the border entry,

430
00:21:32,330 --> 00:21:36,000
a film directed by Carmela Cicero Maresca,

431
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:38,375
a young Canadian woman--

432
00:21:38,375 --> 00:21:41,375
(audience applauds)

433
00:21:48,078 --> 00:21:50,037
(ominous music)

434
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,593
- My mother is dead,

435
00:21:57,179 --> 00:21:59,760
and my other mother has taken up

436
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:01,823
with my dead mother's sister.

437
00:22:05,740 --> 00:22:07,050
- Make a note to look into the rights

438
00:22:07,050 --> 00:22:08,300
for that film, would you?

439
00:22:11,560 --> 00:22:14,300
- Okay, let's just get 15
seconds of the empty auditorium.

440
00:22:14,300 --> 00:22:15,133
That should be enough.

441
00:22:15,133 --> 00:22:16,340
- Rolling.

442
00:22:16,340 --> 00:22:19,250
You mind that one guy in
the front of the theater?

443
00:22:19,250 --> 00:22:20,550
- Oh, bollocks.

444
00:22:20,550 --> 00:22:21,383
Cut it.

445
00:22:23,180 --> 00:22:24,100
Hey!

446
00:22:24,100 --> 00:22:24,933
You!

447
00:22:26,284 --> 00:22:27,117
It's Paradiso.

448
00:22:28,540 --> 00:22:29,777
Hey. Paradiso?

449
00:22:30,660 --> 00:22:32,080
Paradiso?

450
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:32,980
Film's over, mate.

451
00:22:36,497 --> 00:22:37,330
Odd.

452
00:22:39,470 --> 00:22:40,350
I believe he's dead.

453
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:41,751
- [Tori] Dead?

454
00:22:41,751 --> 00:22:42,850
(sniffs)
- Mm.

455
00:22:42,850 --> 00:22:43,683
Rather.

456
00:22:44,900 --> 00:22:47,797
So much for Mr. (Italian
accent) "I'ma Not Your Mother,"

457
00:22:47,797 --> 00:22:48,630
"I'ma Your Wife".

458
00:22:49,857 --> 00:22:50,690
(sniffs)

459
00:22:50,690 --> 00:22:53,163
- (accent) I'ma not
coffee, I'ma deadly poison.

460
00:22:55,020 --> 00:22:59,470
- (accent) I'ma not breathing,
I'ma slowly decomposing.

461
00:22:59,470 --> 00:23:00,303
- Ew.

462
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:02,063
- Come on.

463
00:23:03,110 --> 00:23:04,210
We'd better tell Mr. Wong.

464
00:23:05,837 --> 00:23:07,500
- [George Voiceover] Detective
Blank called together

465
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:09,720
all the surviving finalists for a meeting,

466
00:23:09,720 --> 00:23:12,110
which Tori and I were allowed to attend.

467
00:23:12,110 --> 00:23:13,760
Though he said that the
police had no evidence

468
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,250
linking any of the filmmakers
to the three murders,

469
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:18,620
the only logical supposition
was that one of the finalists

470
00:23:18,620 --> 00:23:21,310
was systematically killing
off the competition,

471
00:23:21,310 --> 00:23:25,113
to ensure that he, or she,
would win the festival.

472
00:23:25,960 --> 00:23:28,950
Though, of course, I was
saddened by the loss of life,

473
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:30,530
I began to realize what a stroke of luck

474
00:23:30,530 --> 00:23:32,430
this might be for my documentary.

475
00:23:32,430 --> 00:23:34,860
- Now, first of all, let me say,

476
00:23:34,860 --> 00:23:37,120
addressing myself to the murderer,

477
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,503
I understand what you're going through.

478
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:44,970
The film industry is
like the elephant world,

479
00:23:44,970 --> 00:23:46,603
it is highly competitive,

480
00:23:48,830 --> 00:23:51,860
so you must be able and willing

481
00:23:51,860 --> 00:23:53,663
to do almost anything to get ahead.

482
00:23:55,190 --> 00:23:59,913
However, and I must state
this very forcefully,

483
00:24:01,290 --> 00:24:04,623
such behavior is simply not acceptable.

484
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:09,223
Now, if there are any more killings,

485
00:24:10,790 --> 00:24:14,690
I am prepared to disqualify
the culprit from the festival,

486
00:24:14,690 --> 00:24:16,470
no questions asked.

487
00:24:16,470 --> 00:24:17,303
- Oh, come on.

488
00:24:17,303 --> 00:24:19,453
We all know who the killer is, don't we?

489
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:23,713
I mean, isn't it obvious that
froggy here is the bad guy?

490
00:24:23,713 --> 00:24:24,762
- Pardon?

491
00:24:24,762 --> 00:24:27,120
- What makes you say that, Carmela?

492
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:28,538
- I'll lay it out for you.

493
00:24:28,538 --> 00:24:31,300
(dramatic music)

494
00:24:31,300 --> 00:24:33,840
You and Paradiso were
rivals from the beginning,

495
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:35,370
and the night before she was killed,

496
00:24:35,370 --> 00:24:37,860
Maria told me that the
two of you had fought,

497
00:24:37,860 --> 00:24:40,810
and everyone knows the grudge
you had against poor William.

498
00:24:43,550 --> 00:24:46,773
- I don't need to stay here and
listen to these absurdities!

499
00:24:50,140 --> 00:24:52,320
- Guilty as sin.

500
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,070
- Please, this isn't helping us.

501
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:56,543
We need facts, not speculation.

502
00:24:57,900 --> 00:24:58,900
- I'll look into it.

503
00:24:59,910 --> 00:25:01,423
I'm a Documentary Filmmaker.

504
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:07,923
An Award-Winning Documentary Filmmaker.

505
00:25:09,687 --> 00:25:11,100
- That's good enough for me.

506
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:12,850
- My documentary about the festival

507
00:25:13,700 --> 00:25:17,180
will now be a documentary
about the search for a killer.

508
00:25:17,180 --> 00:25:18,710
- Now, granted that this Blank fellow

509
00:25:18,710 --> 00:25:21,270
did not seem like he could
detect a flea in a flea circus,

510
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:24,800
what gave you the presumption
that you could do any better?

511
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:28,370
- Sometimes, sir, it takes
an artist to catch an artist.

512
00:25:28,370 --> 00:25:30,360
- [Rugglesworth] Oh, please.

513
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:32,800
- I knew that each of the
finalists qua suspects

514
00:25:32,800 --> 00:25:34,550
had laid their conscience bare in a place

515
00:25:34,550 --> 00:25:37,870
where the police were
unlikely to look: their films.

516
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:39,160
It was merely a question, then,

517
00:25:39,160 --> 00:25:41,750
of interpreting their films
to see where the murderer

518
00:25:41,750 --> 00:25:43,950
had left bloody footprints.

519
00:25:43,950 --> 00:25:45,070
I considered the three films

520
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:46,900
I'd seen thus far from the suspects,

521
00:25:46,900 --> 00:25:48,190
and searched them for clues.

522
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:51,780
Asmali Jawad's film seemed
to rule him out as a suspect.

523
00:25:51,780 --> 00:25:53,327
Certainly there was violence in his film,

524
00:25:53,327 --> 00:25:56,700
but it was nearly scientific
in its rigorous control,

525
00:25:56,700 --> 00:25:58,450
not the wayward passion of a murderer.

526
00:25:58,450 --> 00:26:00,730
Carmela's film, on the other hand,

527
00:26:00,730 --> 00:26:03,340
with its tortured and
confused melancholy heroine

528
00:26:03,340 --> 00:26:04,720
in search of retribution,

529
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:07,660
bespoke a possibility for true violence.

530
00:26:07,660 --> 00:26:10,890
But it was Giscard's film
that, on deeper examination,

531
00:26:10,890 --> 00:26:12,970
represented the smoking gun.

532
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:15,620
His mute protagonist who
went around eating everything

533
00:26:15,620 --> 00:26:17,870
seemed a transparent
stand-in for a director

534
00:26:17,870 --> 00:26:20,760
whose all-consuming ambition and intensity

535
00:26:20,760 --> 00:26:23,210
rendered even the most
heinous act a possibility.

536
00:26:24,110 --> 00:26:26,377
But, of course, I was keeping an open mind

537
00:26:26,377 --> 00:26:27,653
for the time being.

538
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:30,540
- So you're gonna interview
all the filmmakers?

539
00:26:30,540 --> 00:26:31,730
- That's right.

540
00:26:31,730 --> 00:26:33,910
- What are you gonna ask them?

541
00:26:33,910 --> 00:26:36,000
- I'll question them about the murders.

542
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,120
Then I'll ask them about their films.

543
00:26:38,120 --> 00:26:39,470
Or maybe the other way around.

544
00:26:40,900 --> 00:26:42,460
- Do you think Giscard did it?

545
00:26:42,460 --> 00:26:44,380
I mean, everybody else seems to think so.

546
00:26:44,380 --> 00:26:47,720
- Tori, I'm a documentary filmmaker.

547
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:48,983
My job isn't to think.

548
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:51,143
It's to expose.

549
00:26:53,085 --> 00:26:54,460
(knocking)

550
00:26:54,460 --> 00:26:55,700
Ah, that must be Giscard.

551
00:26:55,700 --> 00:26:56,533
He's first.

552
00:27:00,850 --> 00:27:02,390
- May I come in, Mr. Sand?

553
00:27:02,390 --> 00:27:03,320
- Detective.

554
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:04,840
I'm surprised to see you.

555
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:06,630
Am I a suspect?

556
00:27:06,630 --> 00:27:09,538
- I consider everyone a suspect, Mr. Sand.

557
00:27:09,538 --> 00:27:10,890
Including myself.

558
00:27:10,890 --> 00:27:12,400
- Very wise.

559
00:27:12,400 --> 00:27:15,750
Well, course I'll be glad
to answer any questions.

560
00:27:15,750 --> 00:27:18,160
- Well, actually, Mr. Sand,

561
00:27:18,160 --> 00:27:21,200
I've always had great respect
for documentary filmmakers,

562
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:26,200
and I thought maybe we
could compare notes.

563
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,713
- I see.

564
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,140
Well, of course I want to be helpful,

565
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:33,160
but you should understand
that my first obligation

566
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,150
must be to my art.

567
00:27:35,150 --> 00:27:37,580
- Understood.
- Well, then, fire away.

568
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,413
- Okay.

569
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,060
First, you should know

570
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:43,193
that Maria Hernandez wasn't strangled,

571
00:27:44,030 --> 00:27:45,860
she was killed by a blow to the head.

572
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,830
- I see.
- So the question is,

573
00:27:47,830 --> 00:27:49,210
why would someone wrap a scarf

574
00:27:49,210 --> 00:27:50,810
around the neck of a dead woman?

575
00:27:51,740 --> 00:27:54,440
- Well, I would imagine
the killer wanted to divert

576
00:27:54,440 --> 00:27:56,423
suspicion from himself somehow.

577
00:27:58,830 --> 00:28:01,133
So the scarf would be a distracting ploy.

578
00:28:05,350 --> 00:28:07,250
So that the killer doesn't get caught.

579
00:28:11,030 --> 00:28:12,533
And sent to jail.

580
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:20,123
Where he might get raped
by a larger inmate.

581
00:28:22,040 --> 00:28:26,300
- So, what you're saying,
if I read you correctly,

582
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:28,670
is that the killer was trying to divert

583
00:28:28,670 --> 00:28:30,700
suspicion from himself

584
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:35,862
so that he wouldn't get caught

585
00:28:35,862 --> 00:28:37,928
and go to jail.

586
00:28:37,928 --> 00:28:40,409
- Where he might be raped.

587
00:28:40,409 --> 00:28:41,242
- Yeah.

588
00:28:42,262 --> 00:28:43,117
(knocking)
Yeah.

589
00:28:43,117 --> 00:28:45,320
- Ah, that must be Giscard.

590
00:28:45,320 --> 00:28:46,530
A few minutes late, but that's only

591
00:28:46,530 --> 00:28:48,130
to be expected with a Frenchman.

592
00:28:49,522 --> 00:28:50,380
Ah.

593
00:28:50,380 --> 00:28:52,130
I believe you know Detective Blank.

594
00:28:58,320 --> 00:28:59,734
- Harsh.

595
00:28:59,734 --> 00:29:01,963
- That is a powerful film.

596
00:29:02,930 --> 00:29:04,093
- Strong stuff.

597
00:29:05,517 --> 00:29:07,830
- Rated R for violence.

598
00:29:07,830 --> 00:29:11,053
- Uh, the medium is the message?

599
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:15,890
- Hey, that's good, "the
medium is the message."

600
00:29:15,890 --> 00:29:17,090
- Thanks.

601
00:29:17,090 --> 00:29:19,670
I never knew what that meant before.

602
00:29:19,670 --> 00:29:20,640
- Oh, get the camera.

603
00:29:20,640 --> 00:29:21,690
We should shoot this.

604
00:29:23,242 --> 00:29:24,075
(sighs)

605
00:29:24,075 --> 00:29:25,943
So much for suspect numero uno.

606
00:29:27,770 --> 00:29:30,020
Shame we never had a
chance to interview him.

607
00:29:31,230 --> 00:29:33,678
Oh, tragic about his death, of course.

608
00:29:33,678 --> 00:29:37,451
Still, he wasn't much of a filmmaker.

609
00:29:37,451 --> 00:29:39,551
(door clacks)

610
00:29:39,551 --> 00:29:40,860
- No sign of anyone.

611
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:42,290
- The other filmmakers
are meeting for dinner

612
00:29:42,290 --> 00:29:43,830
in half an hour.

613
00:29:43,830 --> 00:29:47,873
I'll go down and break the news
to them, see how they react.

614
00:29:53,808 --> 00:29:56,391
(bar music)

615
00:29:58,512 --> 00:30:01,840
- Well, if it isn't the
private dick himself.

616
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,330
- Hey, I meant to ask you something.

617
00:30:03,330 --> 00:30:04,750
What kind of last name is Sand?

618
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:06,300
Is that short for something?

619
00:30:06,300 --> 00:30:10,553
- Sorry, filmmakers, but I
have some bad news to report.

620
00:30:11,622 --> 00:30:13,805
Giscard is dead.

621
00:30:13,805 --> 00:30:14,705
- Was he murdered?

622
00:30:16,531 --> 00:30:20,800
- Man, this is starting
to get real interesting.

623
00:30:20,800 --> 00:30:25,800
One of these five people is a murderer.

624
00:30:25,890 --> 00:30:27,910
- [Sasha] It's like a movie.

625
00:30:27,910 --> 00:30:30,360
- If it were a movie, who'd play you?

626
00:30:30,360 --> 00:30:31,744
I know who'd play me.

627
00:30:31,744 --> 00:30:32,840
- [George] Who?

628
00:30:32,840 --> 00:30:35,650
- Drew Barrymore or a young Barbara Eden.

629
00:30:35,650 --> 00:30:38,323
I see you as Michael J. Fox, George.

630
00:30:39,280 --> 00:30:40,240
- Thanks a lot.

631
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:42,530
- I'd have to go with Herschel Bernardi.

632
00:30:42,530 --> 00:30:45,267
A young, thin Herschel
Bernardi, of course.

633
00:30:45,267 --> 00:30:47,450
- Asmali Jawad would be
played by Claude Rains,

634
00:30:47,450 --> 00:30:48,720
or maybe Scott Baio.

635
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:50,570
But Scott Baio might not be able to do

636
00:30:50,570 --> 00:30:52,058
the Indian accent, you see?

637
00:30:52,058 --> 00:30:53,110
- [Unknown Filmmaker] Sorry, I can't play.

638
00:30:53,110 --> 00:30:55,590
I think identity is irrelevant.

639
00:30:55,590 --> 00:30:57,800
- [George] Who'd play you, Rosemary?

640
00:30:57,800 --> 00:31:00,480
- Oh, uh, I think Pearl Bailey.

641
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:01,810
You know, an old Pearl Bailey.

642
00:31:01,810 --> 00:31:03,070
- No, that'd have to be in

643
00:31:03,070 --> 00:31:05,470
the all-black version of your life.

644
00:31:05,470 --> 00:31:08,406
In mine, I'd be played by Angela Bassett.

645
00:31:08,406 --> 00:31:10,930
- Asmali Jawad has a good one for himself.

646
00:31:10,930 --> 00:31:12,150
Sammy Davis Jr.

647
00:31:12,150 --> 00:31:13,150
(chuckles)

648
00:31:13,150 --> 00:31:15,390
- I'd like to be played
by Sammy Davis Jr. too.

649
00:31:15,390 --> 00:31:16,360
- Well, that would have to be in

650
00:31:16,360 --> 00:31:18,083
the cross-gender version of your life.

651
00:31:18,083 --> 00:31:21,067
What about the foreign film of your life?

652
00:31:21,067 --> 00:31:21,970
- [Unknown Filmmaker] All
right, now you're talking.

653
00:31:21,970 --> 00:31:24,650
I'd have Max von Sydow, or Toshiro Mifune.

654
00:31:24,650 --> 00:31:26,190
You know, with a bag
on his head, of course.

655
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:28,350
- Yes, and no doubt in the Merchant Ivory

656
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:29,300
version of our lives,

657
00:31:29,300 --> 00:31:31,760
we'd all like to be
played by Emma Thompson.

658
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,160
- Speak for yourself, Lewis.

659
00:31:35,873 --> 00:31:39,070
- But what, precisely,
is your point, Mr. Sand?

660
00:31:39,070 --> 00:31:42,220
- Well, Carmela interrupted
the game by asking--

661
00:31:42,220 --> 00:31:46,040
- So, how did froggy die, anyway?

662
00:31:46,040 --> 00:31:47,930
- There was some film
wrapped around his neck,

663
00:31:47,930 --> 00:31:50,960
but the police seem to
think he was electrocuted.

664
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:52,070
- Wow.

665
00:31:52,070 --> 00:31:53,523
How, like, ironic.

666
00:31:54,850 --> 00:31:55,683
- Why?

667
00:31:58,790 --> 00:32:00,640
- All right, what do you got?

668
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,930
- [George] You know that Giscard
worked on Mike Wong's film?

669
00:32:02,930 --> 00:32:04,970
- All of the finalists worked on his film,

670
00:32:04,970 --> 00:32:06,200
and on each other's.

671
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,080
They're classmates.

672
00:32:07,080 --> 00:32:08,628
- Giscard was the gaffer on Mike's film.

673
00:32:08,628 --> 00:32:09,461
- What's a gaffer?

674
00:32:09,461 --> 00:32:11,630
- The gaffer is the chief electrician.

675
00:32:11,630 --> 00:32:13,383
And Giscard was electrocuted.

676
00:32:14,354 --> 00:32:15,247
- Odd.
- Yes.

677
00:32:15,247 --> 00:32:16,850
And it gets better.

678
00:32:16,850 --> 00:32:20,160
Paradiso, who was poisoned,
worked on craft services.

679
00:32:20,160 --> 00:32:21,910
Do you know what craft services is?

680
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:24,130
Food.

681
00:32:24,130 --> 00:32:25,210
And there's more.

682
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:27,260
William Butler was the DP on Mike's film.

683
00:32:28,510 --> 00:32:30,127
The director of photography.

684
00:32:30,127 --> 00:32:32,550
- Well, you can't be
photographed to death.

685
00:32:32,550 --> 00:32:34,570
- The Spice Girls are
evidence to the contrary,

686
00:32:34,570 --> 00:32:35,980
but never mind that.

687
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,883
As the DP, William shot Mike's film.

688
00:32:40,300 --> 00:32:41,710
And he was shot!

689
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,810
- But that still doesn't
explain why Maria Hernandez--

690
00:32:43,810 --> 00:32:45,780
- Maria was the wardrobe
person on Mike's film,

691
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:46,890
responsible for clothing,

692
00:32:46,890 --> 00:32:48,087
which is why the killer wanted us to think

693
00:32:48,087 --> 00:32:49,593
she was strangled by a scarf.

694
00:32:51,490 --> 00:32:53,090
- I'm beginning to detect a pattern.

695
00:32:53,980 --> 00:32:55,830
But how do the Spice Girls figure in?

696
00:32:59,326 --> 00:33:00,380
- [George Voiceover] That
night, there were to be

697
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:03,020
two more films shown,
two more chances for me

698
00:33:03,020 --> 00:33:05,752
to peer into the psyches of the suspects.

699
00:33:05,752 --> 00:33:08,335
(urban Yiddish music)

700
00:33:10,007 --> 00:33:11,406
- [Moshe Voiceover] A day like that,

701
00:33:11,406 --> 00:33:13,250
I should never have again, God willing.

702
00:33:13,250 --> 00:33:15,695
- [Eliyahu Voiceover] I'm
afraid there must be many more

703
00:33:15,695 --> 00:33:19,240
until all of our enemies
lie dead at our feet.

704
00:33:19,240 --> 00:33:22,170
- [Yehoshua Voiceover] Look,
the sun is almost down.

705
00:33:22,170 --> 00:33:23,780
Shabbos is almost over.

706
00:33:23,780 --> 00:33:26,550
- [Eliyahu Voiceover] Yes,
this Shabbos is almost over,

707
00:33:26,550 --> 00:33:30,440
but a new day will soon dawn
on our corner of Brooklyn,

708
00:33:30,440 --> 00:33:32,650
a new day when we will no longer be

709
00:33:32,650 --> 00:33:35,990
subject to the discriminatory
laws of our neighbors.

710
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:38,400
This Shabbos, we celebrate
here in Brooklyn,

711
00:33:38,400 --> 00:33:43,050
but some day, perhaps next year,
perhaps in a hundred years,

712
00:33:43,050 --> 00:33:45,430
we will celebrate Shabbos here

713
00:33:45,430 --> 00:33:48,250
in the free state of Williamsburg!

714
00:33:48,250 --> 00:33:51,230
- [George] Spike Levy seemed
like a credible suspect

715
00:33:51,230 --> 00:33:52,730
until I realized that William Butler

716
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:54,730
had been killed on a Friday night.

717
00:33:54,730 --> 00:33:56,190
- Ladies and gentlemen,

718
00:33:56,190 --> 00:33:59,679
the director of "Brooklyn
Will Be Ours", Spike Levy.

719
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:02,679
(audience applauds)

720
00:34:04,460 --> 00:34:06,300
- I have one thing I'd like to say.

721
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:09,410
Is my first name really Spike?

722
00:34:09,410 --> 00:34:10,243
No.

723
00:34:10,243 --> 00:34:12,350
Is my last name really Levy?

724
00:34:12,350 --> 00:34:13,183
No.

725
00:34:13,183 --> 00:34:15,570
Am I using another man's
name for my own benefit?

726
00:34:15,570 --> 00:34:18,240
Yes.
(audience applauds)

727
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,990
My people understand me,

728
00:34:19,990 --> 00:34:23,113
if you don't, step aside
before we run you over.

729
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:25,378
Like an elephant.

730
00:34:25,378 --> 00:34:28,378
(audience applauds)

731
00:34:30,020 --> 00:34:31,170
- Excellent.

732
00:34:31,170 --> 00:34:33,580
Well, then, our next film

733
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:37,410
is the winner of the East
19th Street Film Festival,

734
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:39,330
entitled The Quest.

735
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:41,690
The director is Sasha Swann.

736
00:34:41,690 --> 00:34:45,013
Sasha?
(audience applauds)

737
00:34:46,650 --> 00:34:48,640
- I just want to, like,

738
00:34:48,640 --> 00:34:52,393
dedicate this film to
elephants everywhere.

739
00:34:53,833 --> 00:34:54,666
(giggles)

740
00:34:54,666 --> 00:34:56,800
And to the Irish people.

741
00:34:56,800 --> 00:34:59,560
(audience applauds)

742
00:34:59,560 --> 00:35:00,840
Thank you.

743
00:35:00,840 --> 00:35:01,673
Thanks.

744
00:35:03,940 --> 00:35:06,690
(milk splashing)

745
00:35:08,814 --> 00:35:11,397
(ice rattling)

746
00:35:13,140 --> 00:35:16,130
- It's not this millennium
I'm worried about,

747
00:35:16,130 --> 00:35:17,423
it's the next one.

748
00:35:18,770 --> 00:35:22,483
Yeah, the fourth millennium
is gonna be a bitch.

749
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:27,870
But at least my baby won't have

750
00:35:27,870 --> 00:35:30,080
an abusive father, like I did.

751
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:31,180
- Hi, princess.

752
00:35:31,180 --> 00:35:32,640
Hi, sweetheart.

753
00:35:32,640 --> 00:35:35,140
You haven't happened to
see Daddy's nose candy

754
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,650
anywhere around, did you?

755
00:35:36,650 --> 00:35:37,730
- And he won't have a brother

756
00:35:37,730 --> 00:35:40,740
to have an incestuous relationship with.

757
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:42,370
- Come on, sis.

758
00:35:42,370 --> 00:35:44,130
We're only playing.

759
00:35:44,130 --> 00:35:47,130
- And the other kids in first
grade won't make fun of him

760
00:35:47,130 --> 00:35:50,413
because he has a Russian boy's first name.

761
00:35:50,413 --> 00:35:52,619
- [Kids] You've got a
Russian boy's first name--

762
00:35:52,619 --> 00:35:53,968
- I have to get some air.

763
00:35:53,968 --> 00:35:55,407
- [George Voiceover] Sasha
Swann, it was apparent,

764
00:35:55,407 --> 00:35:56,843
was an unlikely killer.

765
00:35:57,910 --> 00:35:59,730
The only violence I felt
emanating from her film

766
00:35:59,730 --> 00:36:01,530
was the harm I might inflict upon myself

767
00:36:01,530 --> 00:36:03,280
if I had to watch the entire thing.

768
00:36:08,300 --> 00:36:09,850
- [George] Hey!

769
00:36:09,850 --> 00:36:10,850
- [Rosemary] George.

770
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:12,500
How are you?
- I'm just fine.

771
00:36:12,500 --> 00:36:15,340
But, then again, I don't
have a film in the festival.

772
00:36:15,340 --> 00:36:16,980
Shouldn't you be a bit more careful?

773
00:36:16,980 --> 00:36:18,790
- What's to be afraid of?

774
00:36:18,790 --> 00:36:19,623
Death?

775
00:36:19,623 --> 00:36:20,683
I've died before.

776
00:36:22,030 --> 00:36:24,680
By the way, I decided that
you do exist, after all.

777
00:36:24,680 --> 00:36:26,193
- I'm glad to hear it.

778
00:36:27,070 --> 00:36:28,390
- My new theory is that we're each

779
00:36:28,390 --> 00:36:29,803
from our own unique planet.

780
00:36:30,650 --> 00:36:33,600
I'm from a world where
there are no colors,

781
00:36:33,600 --> 00:36:35,270
and people are only capable of thinking

782
00:36:35,270 --> 00:36:36,470
one happy thought a day.

783
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,660
- Well, then, I guess I'm from a planet

784
00:36:39,660 --> 00:36:43,210
where the men are named
after famous women writers,

785
00:36:43,210 --> 00:36:46,890
and are capable of wearing the
same clothes for days on end.

786
00:36:46,890 --> 00:36:48,893
- That's more than I
needed to know, George.

787
00:36:49,750 --> 00:36:50,720
- Oh, sorry.

788
00:36:50,720 --> 00:36:52,280
- Although I suspect that our two planets

789
00:36:52,280 --> 00:36:54,300
have very good relations.

790
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,400
- That's good to hear.

791
00:36:57,770 --> 00:37:00,480
Well, then, you should
probably be in there

792
00:37:00,480 --> 00:37:02,810
watching your dwindling
competition, shouldn't you?

793
00:37:02,810 --> 00:37:04,370
- Doesn't matter to me, anyway.

794
00:37:04,370 --> 00:37:06,380
Tomorrow, I'm gonna pull
my film from the festival.

795
00:37:06,380 --> 00:37:07,830
- Really?

796
00:37:07,830 --> 00:37:09,303
Well, I can understand why.

797
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:13,130
I think your safety is more
important than any prize.

798
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:16,010
- It's not my safety I'm worried about.

799
00:37:16,953 --> 00:37:19,870
(suspicious music)

800
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,553
- Rosemary?

801
00:37:23,470 --> 00:37:25,480
Will you come to the interview tomorrow?

802
00:37:25,480 --> 00:37:27,839
It'll really help my documentary.

803
00:37:27,839 --> 00:37:29,340
- Of course, George.

804
00:37:29,340 --> 00:37:30,633
Anything for art.

805
00:37:31,727 --> 00:37:33,180
- [George Voiceover] With
great regret, I realized

806
00:37:33,180 --> 00:37:35,820
that I would not have the
opportunity to see her film,

807
00:37:35,820 --> 00:37:39,340
a film made by a woman
like that, no, not a woman,

808
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:41,979
an archetype, a platonic ideal, a--

809
00:37:41,979 --> 00:37:44,330
(hand taps)
- Oh, hello.

810
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:47,750
- George, I have a favor to ask of you.

811
00:37:47,750 --> 00:37:49,770
- Anything that's in my power, sir,

812
00:37:49,770 --> 00:37:50,880
as long as it doesn't conflict

813
00:37:50,880 --> 00:37:53,123
with my vow as a documentary filmmaker.

814
00:37:54,230 --> 00:37:56,363
- With all the deaths,

815
00:37:57,400 --> 00:37:59,700
the festival is running
low on eligible films.

816
00:38:01,350 --> 00:38:02,860
I'd like you to enter one of yours.

817
00:38:02,860 --> 00:38:03,930
- I really can't allow anything

818
00:38:03,930 --> 00:38:05,950
to interfere with my current project.

819
00:38:05,950 --> 00:38:07,260
It wouldn't be fair to the work.

820
00:38:07,260 --> 00:38:09,130
- It won't be a distraction, George.

821
00:38:09,130 --> 00:38:10,320
You give us one of your films,

822
00:38:10,320 --> 00:38:12,390
and we'll have a special
daytime screening.

823
00:38:12,390 --> 00:38:13,500
That's it.

824
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:15,350
And you'll be eligible for the award.

825
00:38:20,200 --> 00:38:21,870
- Given the circumstances, Mr. Wong,

826
00:38:21,870 --> 00:38:23,600
it's the least that I can do.

827
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:25,430
- And there we have it.

828
00:38:25,430 --> 00:38:27,370
Congratulations, Mr. Sand,

829
00:38:27,370 --> 00:38:29,040
you have now broken every single tenet

830
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:30,940
of documentary filmmaking.

831
00:38:30,940 --> 00:38:33,800
That was the last one, number 54,

832
00:38:33,800 --> 00:38:36,130
documentary filmmaker shall not enter film

833
00:38:36,130 --> 00:38:38,320
into film festival he is documenting.

834
00:38:38,320 --> 00:38:40,570
- But it made perfect sense.

835
00:38:40,570 --> 00:38:42,947
In order to understand the
thinking of the finalists,

836
00:38:42,947 --> 00:38:45,623
and the killer, I would
have to become one myself.

837
00:38:47,080 --> 00:38:48,163
A finalist, that is.

838
00:38:49,610 --> 00:38:52,230
The next morning when we
sat down to interviews,

839
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,640
I was a peer.

840
00:38:53,640 --> 00:38:54,550
Okay, Sasha.

841
00:38:54,550 --> 00:38:56,330
Two questions:

842
00:38:56,330 --> 00:38:59,553
Who do you think is the killer,
and why couldn't it be you?

843
00:39:00,900 --> 00:39:04,220
- Well, it couldn't be me

844
00:39:04,220 --> 00:39:09,220
because, like, well, everybody
likes and respects me,

845
00:39:10,520 --> 00:39:15,043
and my work is, like,
philosophical, you know?

846
00:39:16,570 --> 00:39:19,230
Now, I don't know who the killer is,

847
00:39:19,230 --> 00:39:21,820
but if you saw that
film by Jasmali Aswad--

848
00:39:21,820 --> 00:39:23,420
- Asmali Jawad.

849
00:39:23,420 --> 00:39:26,570
- Whatever, I think we all
have a pretty good idea

850
00:39:26,570 --> 00:39:30,990
of who here is capable of,
like, deprived acts of murder.

851
00:39:30,990 --> 00:39:33,583
- Please, that is absurd.

852
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:36,010
- [Unknown Filmmaker]
That Indian Tarantino.

853
00:39:36,010 --> 00:39:37,390
I mean, he seems like a nice enough guy,

854
00:39:37,390 --> 00:39:40,340
but obviously there's another side to him.

855
00:39:40,340 --> 00:39:41,761
- Look at me.

856
00:39:41,761 --> 00:39:44,758
Asmali Jawad is a Hindu,
for heaven's sake.

857
00:39:44,758 --> 00:39:47,369
Asmali Jawad is only three feet tall.

858
00:39:47,369 --> 00:39:50,870
Asmali Jawad can barely
lift his own toothbrush.

859
00:39:50,870 --> 00:39:53,810
- Well, you know who always
gets the blame for everything?

860
00:39:53,810 --> 00:39:54,830
We do.

861
00:39:54,830 --> 00:39:56,320
The Jews.

862
00:39:56,320 --> 00:39:58,720
So, I figure it's just a matter of time

863
00:39:58,720 --> 00:40:02,100
before everyone decides that I did it.

864
00:40:02,100 --> 00:40:04,030
And, considering the history of my people,

865
00:40:04,030 --> 00:40:06,970
I'm very hesitant to point
the finger elsewhere.

866
00:40:06,970 --> 00:40:10,620
- Of course, I wouldn't
put it past the Jew.

867
00:40:10,620 --> 00:40:11,580
- Asmali Jawad.

868
00:40:11,580 --> 00:40:13,100
- Oh, please!

869
00:40:13,100 --> 00:40:15,120
- That Indian is a pathetic little worm.

870
00:40:15,120 --> 00:40:16,610
He could never have done it.

871
00:40:16,610 --> 00:40:17,780
- Ha.
- And that film of his

872
00:40:17,780 --> 00:40:19,930
is just a stupid little phallocentric,

873
00:40:19,930 --> 00:40:22,170
Neanderthal sex farce transferral,

874
00:40:22,170 --> 00:40:24,550
with those guys shoving
their oversize guns

875
00:40:24,550 --> 00:40:26,193
into every hole they can find.

876
00:40:27,565 --> 00:40:30,840
- Asmali Jawad's film is simply
an existential exploration

877
00:40:30,840 --> 00:40:32,750
into alternate philosophies
and lifestyles.

878
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:36,080
- Now, I'm capable of doing it.

879
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:38,630
- And you know what
they say about lesbians.

880
00:40:38,630 --> 00:40:40,160
- But I don't need to.

881
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,370
- Definitely Asmali Jawad.

882
00:40:42,370 --> 00:40:43,250
- Please!

883
00:40:43,250 --> 00:40:46,060
- See, I'm gonna win this festival,

884
00:40:46,060 --> 00:40:47,920
regardless of how much opposition there is

885
00:40:47,920 --> 00:40:50,290
'cause, quite frankly,
I haven't seen a film

886
00:40:50,290 --> 00:40:51,698
that comes close to mine.

887
00:40:51,698 --> 00:40:52,531
- [Unknown Filmmaker] Then again,

888
00:40:52,531 --> 00:40:54,160
since I don't believe in identity,

889
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,880
how can I be sure that a murder
has actually taken place?

890
00:40:57,880 --> 00:41:00,310
- Answer one question for Asmali Jawad.

891
00:41:00,310 --> 00:41:01,740
One question.

892
00:41:01,740 --> 00:41:05,680
Why would someone wear a
paper bag over his head?

893
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:07,070
Huh? Why?

894
00:41:07,070 --> 00:41:08,957
- Got to be Asmali Jawad.

895
00:41:09,797 --> 00:41:10,900
- Asmali Jawad does not see

896
00:41:10,900 --> 00:41:13,760
why he should be answering
any more questions.

897
00:41:13,760 --> 00:41:17,090
He has obviously already
been tried and convicted

898
00:41:17,090 --> 00:41:18,273
by a jury of his peers.

899
00:41:19,182 --> 00:41:21,450
(speaking in foreign language)

900
00:41:21,450 --> 00:41:23,040
- All the murder victims died in ways

901
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:25,210
related to their work on Mike's film.

902
00:41:25,210 --> 00:41:26,885
What was your job on that shoot?

903
00:41:26,885 --> 00:41:28,820
- [Unknown Filmmaker] I
was the animal wrangler.

904
00:41:28,820 --> 00:41:30,360
- I drove the equipment truck.

905
00:41:30,360 --> 00:41:31,980
- Pyrotechnics.

906
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:33,600
- I was the editor.

907
00:41:33,600 --> 00:41:34,893
You know, chop chop.

908
00:41:40,037 --> 00:41:41,590
- [George Voiceover] As
enlightening as these interviews

909
00:41:41,590 --> 00:41:44,640
had been, the one I'd most anticipated,

910
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:48,203
both personally and
professionally, was yet to come.

911
00:41:50,619 --> 00:41:51,840
(door clacks)

912
00:41:51,840 --> 00:41:52,673
- Rosemary.

913
00:41:53,620 --> 00:41:54,720
It's nice to see you again.

914
00:41:54,720 --> 00:41:56,300
- Mr. Wong just told
me you're going to have

915
00:41:56,300 --> 00:41:57,700
a film in the festival.

916
00:41:57,700 --> 00:41:58,750
- That's right.

917
00:41:58,750 --> 00:42:00,020
- [Rosemary] You can't do that.

918
00:42:00,020 --> 00:42:00,930
- Why?

919
00:42:00,930 --> 00:42:02,380
- You just can't, that's all.

920
00:42:03,650 --> 00:42:05,550
- I'm sorry, but the decision's final.

921
00:42:09,900 --> 00:42:12,903
Well, let's begin, then.

922
00:42:17,080 --> 00:42:18,480
I appreciate your coming by,

923
00:42:18,480 --> 00:42:20,550
even though you're removing
your film from the festival.

924
00:42:20,550 --> 00:42:21,900
Have you told Mr. Wong yet?

925
00:42:24,460 --> 00:42:25,620
- Actually, I've just decided

926
00:42:25,620 --> 00:42:27,620
not to remove my film from the festival.

927
00:42:28,520 --> 00:42:29,353
- Really?

928
00:42:30,780 --> 00:42:32,580
May I ask why you changed your mind?

929
00:42:34,110 --> 00:42:36,140
- What are you, afraid of the competition?

930
00:42:36,140 --> 00:42:37,200
- [George] I'm glad, actually.

931
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:39,243
It means we'll all get a
chance to see your film.

932
00:42:40,170 --> 00:42:41,820
- I suppose you will.

933
00:42:41,820 --> 00:42:44,920
- I'm going to ask you the same
questions I asked the others

934
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,993
Who do you think is the killer,
and why couldn't it be you?

935
00:42:49,860 --> 00:42:50,693
- It is me.

936
00:42:52,970 --> 00:42:55,622
We're all responsible, don't you think?

937
00:42:55,622 --> 00:42:59,080
That's why everyone's so
desperate to find the killer.

938
00:42:59,080 --> 00:43:00,570
- Cut.

939
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:01,965
Tori, cut.

940
00:43:01,965 --> 00:43:03,600
(camera clicks off)

941
00:43:03,600 --> 00:43:06,220
Tori, would you mind awfully leaving

942
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,970
Rosemary and me alone for a minute?

943
00:43:09,230 --> 00:43:11,913
- Yeah, sure thing, "boss".

944
00:43:13,460 --> 00:43:16,090
This is supposed to be a
collaboration, you know?

945
00:43:16,090 --> 00:43:17,400
- It is.

946
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:20,270
This is personal, it's not about the film.

947
00:43:20,270 --> 00:43:21,640
- Whatever.

948
00:43:21,640 --> 00:43:25,193
Remember, I own half.

949
00:43:29,021 --> 00:43:30,785
- Be careful, George.

950
00:43:30,785 --> 00:43:32,050
Be very careful.

951
00:43:32,050 --> 00:43:33,640
- I'm sorry if I've angered you

952
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:35,230
by entering my film in the festival.

953
00:43:35,230 --> 00:43:36,393
- I don't think you know

954
00:43:36,393 --> 00:43:38,540
what you're getting yourself involved in.

955
00:43:38,540 --> 00:43:40,697
- Maybe not, but...

956
00:43:40,697 --> 00:43:42,289
That's filmmaking.

957
00:43:43,270 --> 00:43:47,813
Rosemary, I wonder if you'd
let me look at your film.

958
00:43:47,813 --> 00:43:48,840
Now.

959
00:43:48,840 --> 00:43:49,673
- Why?

960
00:43:50,610 --> 00:43:52,230
- I don't know why,

961
00:43:52,230 --> 00:43:54,900
but all my instincts as
a documentary filmmaker

962
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:56,000
tell me that I should.

963
00:43:56,870 --> 00:43:58,610
- I'm sorry, George,
but I can't allow that.

964
00:43:58,610 --> 00:44:00,660
- The judges have already seen
it, so why won't you let me?

965
00:44:00,660 --> 00:44:03,023
- I feel very strongly about this, George.

966
00:44:03,860 --> 00:44:06,423
Ask me anything else,
but this I cannot do.

967
00:44:07,650 --> 00:44:10,050
- Don't quote The Godfather to me.

968
00:44:10,050 --> 00:44:10,883
- Sorry.

969
00:44:12,180 --> 00:44:14,830
- I can't help but feel that
you're hiding something.

970
00:44:15,840 --> 00:44:18,963
- George, I'm hiding everything.

971
00:44:21,330 --> 00:44:23,530
- [George] Question is, why
would someone murder people

972
00:44:23,530 --> 00:44:26,240
in a way related to their
jobs on Mike's film?

973
00:44:26,240 --> 00:44:27,360
- [Tori] I don't know.

974
00:44:27,360 --> 00:44:29,737
- This is definitely feature material.

975
00:44:29,737 --> 00:44:32,982
Now, are there any other
suspects we're forgetting about?

976
00:44:32,982 --> 00:44:34,961
Perhaps Arthur.

977
00:44:34,961 --> 00:44:36,690
After all, there was that
elephant pattern on the scarf

978
00:44:36,690 --> 00:44:38,540
wrapped around Maria's neck.

979
00:44:38,540 --> 00:44:41,640
Maybe he somehow felt
he was getting revenge

980
00:44:41,640 --> 00:44:42,683
for Mike's death.

981
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,203
Say, Tori, do you think we're
not approaching these murders

982
00:44:48,203 --> 00:44:51,489
with the necessary gravity and sobriety?

983
00:44:51,489 --> 00:44:54,283
Are we becoming desensitized
to the violence?

984
00:44:56,690 --> 00:44:58,690
- Nah.
- Didn't think so.

985
00:44:58,690 --> 00:45:00,763
- Hey, I've been thinking,

986
00:45:01,710 --> 00:45:04,150
since student filmmakers are being killed,

987
00:45:04,150 --> 00:45:05,890
if we want to find the killer,

988
00:45:05,890 --> 00:45:08,220
we should observe the
rules of student film.

989
00:45:08,220 --> 00:45:09,070
- What are you talking about?

990
00:45:09,070 --> 00:45:10,850
- There are certain rules
that one must abide by

991
00:45:10,850 --> 00:45:12,910
in order to make a
successful student film.

992
00:45:12,910 --> 00:45:13,743
Number one--

993
00:45:13,743 --> 00:45:15,610
- We have to be pretentious
and belabor every point?

994
00:45:15,610 --> 00:45:16,950
- Exactly.

995
00:45:16,950 --> 00:45:19,030
- Are you under the illusion
that what you're saying

996
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:20,973
makes the slightest bit of sense?

997
00:45:22,960 --> 00:45:24,280
- Yes.

998
00:45:24,280 --> 00:45:26,833
- Glad to see you're operating
at full potential again.

999
00:45:28,693 --> 00:45:30,398
- [George Voiceover] That
afternoon, my film was shown.

1000
00:45:30,398 --> 00:45:32,610
(film projector clicking)

1001
00:45:32,610 --> 00:45:34,130
- The name's Sand, George Sand,

1002
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:36,080
and I demand to see Jerry J. Johnson,

1003
00:45:36,080 --> 00:45:38,150
the CEO of Breckenridge International!

1004
00:45:38,150 --> 00:45:40,310
I must warn you, I'm a British national!

1005
00:45:40,310 --> 00:45:42,310
- [Guard] Come this way.

1006
00:45:45,000 --> 00:45:47,050
- Mr. Johnson, your company exploits

1007
00:45:47,050 --> 00:45:48,390
poor workers in Costa Rica,

1008
00:45:48,390 --> 00:45:49,760
who are exposed to toxic agents

1009
00:45:49,760 --> 00:45:51,440
in your manufacturing plant.

1010
00:45:51,440 --> 00:45:53,020
- [Jerry] No, they don't.

1011
00:45:53,020 --> 00:45:54,080
- [George] Yes, they do.

1012
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:55,220
- No, they don't.

1013
00:45:55,220 --> 00:45:57,340
I went down there myself last week

1014
00:45:57,340 --> 00:45:59,120
to see about those allegations,

1015
00:45:59,120 --> 00:46:01,470
and I can confirm that all
of our Costa Rican employees

1016
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:03,683
are working under
perfectly safe conditions.

1017
00:46:04,897 --> 00:46:05,740
- [George] Are you sure?

1018
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:06,643
- I'm positive.

1019
00:46:07,670 --> 00:46:09,803
- Oh, um, well...

1020
00:46:09,803 --> 00:46:10,869
Carry on.

1021
00:46:13,843 --> 00:46:17,676
(triumphant orchestral music)

1022
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:21,160
(clapping)

1023
00:46:29,310 --> 00:46:31,120
- Congratulations.

1024
00:46:31,120 --> 00:46:32,970
You should be very proud.

1025
00:46:32,970 --> 00:46:33,803
- Thank you.

1026
00:46:33,803 --> 00:46:35,873
I'm glad audience response is unanimous.

1027
00:46:37,060 --> 00:46:38,790
- Afternoon screenings.

1028
00:46:38,790 --> 00:46:40,470
You can't worry about that.

1029
00:46:40,470 --> 00:46:42,103
- Well, one does one's best.

1030
00:46:43,610 --> 00:46:46,410
- How'd you get so into
documentaries, anyway?

1031
00:46:46,410 --> 00:46:48,673
They obviously mean a lot to you.

1032
00:46:48,673 --> 00:46:50,220
- It's rather an
interesting story, actually.

1033
00:46:50,220 --> 00:46:52,086
Would you care to hear it?

1034
00:46:52,086 --> 00:46:53,903
- I would care to.

1035
00:46:53,903 --> 00:46:57,330
- It all started when I was a
small child living in London.

1036
00:46:57,330 --> 00:46:59,160
I was coming home with my late parents,

1037
00:46:59,160 --> 00:47:00,380
Bruce and Wayne Sand.

1038
00:47:00,380 --> 00:47:02,080
- Bruce and Wayne?

1039
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,390
You had two fathers?

1040
00:47:03,390 --> 00:47:06,830
- No, my grandfather
named my mother Wayne.

1041
00:47:06,830 --> 00:47:08,333
He was a big fan of the Duke's.

1042
00:47:09,354 --> 00:47:10,710
- [Rosemary] Oh.

1043
00:47:10,710 --> 00:47:12,410
- Anyway, the three of us
were coming home from a movie.

1044
00:47:12,410 --> 00:47:14,100
I think it was Sleeper.

1045
00:47:14,100 --> 00:47:16,640
Life was simple and happy.

1046
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:20,050
Then, out of nowhere, a thug appeared.

1047
00:47:20,050 --> 00:47:22,100
My father was a prosecuting attorney,

1048
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,800
and had put this chap away for life.

1049
00:47:23,800 --> 00:47:26,250
But he'd escaped, and was after revenge.

1050
00:47:26,250 --> 00:47:31,250
Just then, out of nowhere, a
bat appeared, flying at me.

1051
00:47:31,280 --> 00:47:34,550
I thought how wonderful it
would be to be like a bat,

1052
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:36,630
prowling the night streets,

1053
00:47:36,630 --> 00:47:39,743
bringing light to the
darkest corners of society.

1054
00:47:40,590 --> 00:47:45,570
Then, out of nowhere, appeared
a documentary filmmaker.

1055
00:47:45,570 --> 00:47:46,620
He was trying to get material

1056
00:47:46,620 --> 00:47:48,740
for a documentary on crime and criminals.

1057
00:47:48,740 --> 00:47:51,740
From that moment on, my fate was decided.

1058
00:47:51,740 --> 00:47:54,830
I was to be a documentary filmmaker.

1059
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,470
I started close to home.

1060
00:47:56,470 --> 00:47:59,730
I documented everything
in my own life first.

1061
00:47:59,730 --> 00:48:00,763
My confirmation.

1062
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:04,560
My last day of public school.

1063
00:48:04,560 --> 00:48:06,320
Even my loss of virginity.

1064
00:48:06,320 --> 00:48:08,780
Well, at least the prelude
to my loss of virginity,

1065
00:48:08,780 --> 00:48:10,020
though I was able to reenact

1066
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:11,750
the entire event for the camera later,

1067
00:48:11,750 --> 00:48:14,400
after the subject became more comfortable.

1068
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:16,500
I've always made documentaries.

1069
00:48:16,500 --> 00:48:17,840
It's my destiny.

1070
00:48:17,840 --> 00:48:19,360
- It's a mania, George.

1071
00:48:19,360 --> 00:48:20,270
- It's a calling.

1072
00:48:20,270 --> 00:48:22,850
- Many are called, but
few answer the phone.

1073
00:48:22,850 --> 00:48:25,009
That's what all the filmmakers
here have in common.

1074
00:48:25,009 --> 00:48:26,350
- What, a death wish?

1075
00:48:26,350 --> 00:48:27,760
- No.

1076
00:48:27,760 --> 00:48:29,720
There's a reason why no one
here's removed their film,

1077
00:48:29,720 --> 00:48:31,450
despite the risk.

1078
00:48:31,450 --> 00:48:34,180
We all have a passion to make
movies, maybe not talent,

1079
00:48:34,180 --> 00:48:38,003
but passion, a need that
drives us to take stupid risks.

1080
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:41,650
Not many people can understand that.

1081
00:48:41,650 --> 00:48:43,120
- I can.

1082
00:48:43,120 --> 00:48:46,200
- That's because you have
the same mania, George.

1083
00:48:46,200 --> 00:48:49,210
But, then, I've always
been drawn to maniacs.

1084
00:48:49,210 --> 00:48:50,057
- So have I.

1085
00:48:52,120 --> 00:48:52,953
- I have to go.

1086
00:48:54,660 --> 00:48:56,660
- Will you be coming to the costume party?

1087
00:48:56,660 --> 00:48:58,090
- I wouldn't miss it.

1088
00:48:58,090 --> 00:49:00,990
People reveal themselves through
the costumes they choose.

1089
00:49:03,670 --> 00:49:06,615
- Well, um, not always.

1090
00:49:06,615 --> 00:49:09,198
(party music)

1091
00:49:14,947 --> 00:49:16,670
- [George Voiceover] That
night was the festival

1092
00:49:16,670 --> 00:49:18,720
costume party, which all the filmmakers

1093
00:49:18,720 --> 00:49:20,120
were supposed to attend,

1094
00:49:20,120 --> 00:49:23,103
and I was going to seize the
opportunity that it presented.

1095
00:49:28,590 --> 00:49:30,730
We spotted trouble coming our way,

1096
00:49:30,730 --> 00:49:33,030
trouble in a red suit and a white beard

1097
00:49:33,030 --> 00:49:34,963
with a sack full of dangerous goodies.

1098
00:49:42,768 --> 00:49:44,935
- I got something for you.

1099
00:49:53,490 --> 00:49:55,183
I was a guerilla once too.

1100
00:50:03,399 --> 00:50:06,316
(party horns wail)

1101
00:50:08,166 --> 00:50:09,374
- [George] There she is.

1102
00:50:09,374 --> 00:50:10,820
- Who?
- The chicken.

1103
00:50:10,820 --> 00:50:13,260
But I must be certain.

1104
00:50:13,260 --> 00:50:16,710
- You know, it'll never
work between you two.

1105
00:50:16,710 --> 00:50:18,067
You're too different.

1106
00:50:34,650 --> 00:50:36,650
Of course, this must have been 1984

1107
00:50:36,650 --> 00:50:39,480
when I was secretary of
the interior, which...

1108
00:50:40,500 --> 00:50:41,333
What the hell?

1109
00:50:41,333 --> 00:50:42,922
You spoiled my rap on the devil, man.

1110
00:50:42,922 --> 00:50:43,920
- It's her.

1111
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:46,210
I'm gonna sneak into her editing
room and look at her film.

1112
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:48,300
Try to keep her here as long as you can.

1113
00:50:48,300 --> 00:50:50,550
- Too late, there goes
your little chickadee.

1114
00:50:52,850 --> 00:50:53,683
- Damn.

1115
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:56,433
Hey!

1116
00:50:56,433 --> 00:50:57,266
Hey!

1117
00:50:58,490 --> 00:51:00,220
I love your costume.

1118
00:51:00,220 --> 00:51:02,893
It really, um, highlights your figure.

1119
00:51:05,920 --> 00:51:09,180
- I don't quite know how to
respond to that, Mr. Sand.

1120
00:51:09,180 --> 00:51:10,053
- Oh, sorry.

1121
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:13,350
I mistook you for another chicken.

1122
00:51:13,350 --> 00:51:15,420
- Yes, I suppose you think

1123
00:51:15,420 --> 00:51:17,320
we chickens all look alike, don't you?

1124
00:51:22,388 --> 00:51:23,900
- [George Voiceover]
As for what came next,

1125
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:27,313
I can't say I'm proud of
it, but it was necessary.

1126
00:51:28,633 --> 00:51:31,550
(suspicious music)

1127
00:52:03,052 --> 00:52:06,302
(door handle rattling)

1128
00:52:25,551 --> 00:52:27,968
(card snaps)

1129
00:52:47,971 --> 00:52:50,471
(lock clicks)

1130
00:53:01,527 --> 00:53:05,293
(editing table turns on)

1131
00:53:06,568 --> 00:53:10,068
- [Woman] With this elephant, I thee kill.

1132
00:53:11,265 --> 00:53:13,481
- [George] Oh, my God.

1133
00:53:13,481 --> 00:53:16,045
(door clacks)

1134
00:53:16,045 --> 00:53:17,952
(editing table turns off)

1135
00:53:17,952 --> 00:53:20,869
(suspicious music)

1136
00:53:32,407 --> 00:53:34,370
- [George Voiceover] I was
so unnerved by what I'd seen

1137
00:53:34,370 --> 00:53:37,675
that I hardly paid attention
to the next day's film.

1138
00:53:37,675 --> 00:53:40,399
(angsty music)

1139
00:53:40,399 --> 00:53:41,699
(Holden sighs)

1140
00:53:41,699 --> 00:53:43,380
- [Holden Voiceover] My name is Holden.

1141
00:53:43,380 --> 00:53:44,543
Holden Samsa.

1142
00:53:46,610 --> 00:53:49,200
My roommate Stradbater
always got the chicks.

1143
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:51,950
He was a handsome bastard, and he knew it.

1144
00:53:51,950 --> 00:53:53,740
I couldn't help but wonder
what he would look like

1145
00:53:53,740 --> 00:53:54,740
with his throat cut.

1146
00:54:05,080 --> 00:54:06,803
- [Rosemary] I have to go, Mr. Wong.

1147
00:54:07,987 --> 00:54:10,840
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean to
interrupt your conversation.

1148
00:54:10,840 --> 00:54:12,510
- Oh, it's not your fault.

1149
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:14,200
That girl has been on pins and needles

1150
00:54:14,200 --> 00:54:16,020
ever since Maria was killed.

1151
00:54:16,020 --> 00:54:17,550
- I heard her mention your son's name.

1152
00:54:17,550 --> 00:54:19,370
Were she and Mike close?

1153
00:54:19,370 --> 00:54:23,260
- Yes, she and my son were quite close.

1154
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:27,070
Because of that, I recused
myself from judging her film.

1155
00:54:27,070 --> 00:54:28,130
I didn't want anyone to think

1156
00:54:28,130 --> 00:54:30,500
that favoritism could be involved.

1157
00:54:30,500 --> 00:54:32,690
- Is there anyone else around
who worked on your son's film,

1158
00:54:32,690 --> 00:54:34,650
besides the other finalists?

1159
00:54:34,650 --> 00:54:35,970
I have some questions.

1160
00:54:35,970 --> 00:54:38,240
- Well, there's Elliot Lewis,

1161
00:54:38,240 --> 00:54:40,100
who's one of the judges this year.

1162
00:54:40,100 --> 00:54:43,030
He was the assistant
director on Mike's film.

1163
00:54:43,030 --> 00:54:45,060
- Yeah, I worked on that film.

1164
00:54:45,060 --> 00:54:48,780
It was a very difficult shoot,
even before Mike was killed.

1165
00:54:48,780 --> 00:54:50,600
- [George] What do you mean?

1166
00:54:50,600 --> 00:54:54,620
- Well, Mike drove the
crew hard, and Rosemary,

1167
00:54:54,620 --> 00:54:57,140
Rosemary Olsen, she was the key grip,

1168
00:54:57,140 --> 00:55:00,070
that's the person who pushes the dolly,

1169
00:55:00,070 --> 00:55:02,940
well, she didn't exactly
know what she was doing,

1170
00:55:02,940 --> 00:55:06,240
so every dolly shot took twice
as long as it should have.

1171
00:55:06,240 --> 00:55:07,720
People said Mike only let her do it

1172
00:55:07,720 --> 00:55:11,213
because they were, you know.

1173
00:55:12,920 --> 00:55:15,560
Anyway, as always happens on
films, they started to fight,

1174
00:55:15,560 --> 00:55:18,070
more and more as the film went along.

1175
00:55:18,070 --> 00:55:20,213
And then that fateful day came.

1176
00:55:22,690 --> 00:55:25,900
- Go on, and please look
at me, not at the camera.

1177
00:55:25,900 --> 00:55:27,550
- Oh.

1178
00:55:27,550 --> 00:55:28,383
Sorry.

1179
00:55:30,120 --> 00:55:32,160
Anyway, Mike always liked dolly shots,

1180
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:33,520
he liked the camera moving.

1181
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:35,060
The faster the better.

1182
00:55:35,060 --> 00:55:36,190
So, on this one shot,

1183
00:55:36,190 --> 00:55:38,000
he wanted the dolly to move really fast,

1184
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:40,430
but no matter how fast
Rosemary would push the dolly,

1185
00:55:40,430 --> 00:55:42,720
Mike would always yell, "Faster!"

1186
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:45,330
Each time, Mike would stand
between the dolly tracks

1187
00:55:45,330 --> 00:55:46,230
at the beginning of the shot

1188
00:55:46,230 --> 00:55:47,500
to make sure he wasn't in the frame,

1189
00:55:47,500 --> 00:55:50,490
and then step back as
the dolly came around.

1190
00:55:50,490 --> 00:55:54,130
And he'd watch the shot on
this little video monitor.

1191
00:55:54,130 --> 00:55:57,487
Well, finally, Rosemary got
fed up, and she yelled at Mike,

1192
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:59,600
"You want faster, how's this?!"

1193
00:55:59,600 --> 00:56:01,330
And as the camera flew down the tracks,

1194
00:56:01,330 --> 00:56:03,640
Mike finally looked satisfied.

1195
00:56:03,640 --> 00:56:06,397
He was turning to Rosemary and saying,

1196
00:56:06,397 --> 00:56:08,536
"Yes, that's..."

1197
00:56:08,536 --> 00:56:10,050
(loud thud)

1198
00:56:10,050 --> 00:56:12,500
Doctor said he was dead
before he hit the ground.

1199
00:56:14,170 --> 00:56:15,870
- If Mike died while you were shooting,

1200
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:16,970
who finished the film?

1201
00:56:18,660 --> 00:56:20,063
- Rosemary, of course.

1202
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,580
It was a wonderful opportunity for her.

1203
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:27,310
- Thank you, Elliot.

1204
00:56:28,800 --> 00:56:29,700
You can cut, Tori.

1205
00:56:30,870 --> 00:56:32,080
- Oh, pardon me for rushing off,

1206
00:56:32,080 --> 00:56:35,870
but I'm putting the
finishing touches on my film

1207
00:56:35,870 --> 00:56:38,623
and I've only got a few more hours.

1208
00:56:41,630 --> 00:56:43,133
- Double espresso, please.

1209
00:56:44,040 --> 00:56:45,290
Extra bitter.

1210
00:56:45,290 --> 00:56:46,903
- I thought I might find you here.

1211
00:56:48,674 --> 00:56:50,420
- I have nothing to say to you.

1212
00:56:50,420 --> 00:56:52,970
- Your film's entitled "Sinner's Cafe",

1213
00:56:52,970 --> 00:56:55,087
And this is the Sinner's Cafe, after all.

1214
00:56:56,120 --> 00:56:57,590
- I changed the title.

1215
00:56:57,590 --> 00:56:59,233
Sinner's Cafe seemed too obscure.

1216
00:57:00,310 --> 00:57:02,070
Oh, and you know, I do
have something for you.

1217
00:57:02,070 --> 00:57:03,910
This part says "orge Sand".

1218
00:57:03,910 --> 00:57:05,053
I figure it's yours?

1219
00:57:08,660 --> 00:57:09,493
- Oops.

1220
00:57:14,790 --> 00:57:16,190
Rosemary, I...

1221
00:57:17,100 --> 00:57:18,203
Can I sit down?
- No.

1222
00:57:22,520 --> 00:57:23,353
- Rosemary.

1223
00:57:26,210 --> 00:57:30,370
I'm sorry I broke into your
editing room, but I had to.

1224
00:57:30,370 --> 00:57:31,963
I'm a documentary filmmaker.

1225
00:57:35,540 --> 00:57:37,203
Rosemary, I've seen your film.

1226
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:39,320
I know that it implicates you

1227
00:57:39,320 --> 00:57:41,140
in the murder of William Butler.

1228
00:57:41,140 --> 00:57:42,490
- Don't sell it short.

1229
00:57:42,490 --> 00:57:44,520
It does a whole hell of
a lot more than that.

1230
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:46,910
- Rosemary, I want to believe
you're innocent, I really do,

1231
00:57:46,910 --> 00:57:48,360
but, as a documentary filmmaker,

1232
00:57:48,360 --> 00:57:50,590
I have to believe the
evidence that I've collected.

1233
00:57:50,590 --> 00:57:52,270
- It doesn't matter what you believe,

1234
00:57:52,270 --> 00:57:53,570
or what anyone else believes.

1235
00:57:54,600 --> 00:57:56,630
After tonight, it'll all be over.

1236
00:57:56,630 --> 00:57:58,670
- If you know that your
film implicates you,

1237
00:57:58,670 --> 00:58:00,020
why won't you pull it from the festival?

1238
00:58:00,020 --> 00:58:02,290
Do you need the prize money that badly?

1239
00:58:02,290 --> 00:58:04,650
- Oh, yeah, I need the
money so I can buy myself

1240
00:58:04,650 --> 00:58:06,123
some nice prison clothes.

1241
00:58:06,980 --> 00:58:09,890
- Then why don't you pull
it from the festival?

1242
00:58:09,890 --> 00:58:11,020
Otherwise--
- Don't you think

1243
00:58:11,020 --> 00:58:12,290
I want to pull it?

1244
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:14,870
Don't you think I know it implicates me?

1245
00:58:14,870 --> 00:58:17,777
What kind of a fucking
moron do you take me for?!

1246
00:58:19,580 --> 00:58:22,053
- Um, those are all
rhetorical questions, right?

1247
00:58:23,003 --> 00:58:25,003
(sighs)

1248
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:28,420
Then why won't you do it?!

1249
00:58:28,420 --> 00:58:31,963
- Two words: artistic fucking integrity.

1250
00:58:39,270 --> 00:58:41,500
- Well, that seemed to settle it.

1251
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:43,960
I'd allowed my personal feelings
to interfere with my work,

1252
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,710
but it had had no effect.

1253
00:58:45,710 --> 00:58:47,650
My documentary was like a runaway train

1254
00:58:47,650 --> 00:58:49,549
traveling toward somewhere
I did not want to go,

1255
00:58:49,549 --> 00:58:50,450
and there was no getting off

1256
00:58:50,450 --> 00:58:52,110
until we reached our final destination.

1257
00:58:52,110 --> 00:58:54,900
Here at the Second Annual
Mike Wong Film Festival,

1258
00:58:54,900 --> 00:58:58,270
the stars of the independent
film world are out in force.

1259
00:58:58,270 --> 00:58:59,703
There's what's-his-name.

1260
00:59:01,090 --> 00:59:03,383
There's that bloke who made that film.

1261
00:59:03,383 --> 00:59:04,630
And there's that woman
who wrote that script

1262
00:59:04,630 --> 00:59:06,750
that Bruce Willis almost did.

1263
00:59:06,750 --> 00:59:08,913
And, of course, Harvey Weinstein is here.

1264
00:59:10,620 --> 00:59:13,620
- The Mike Wong Film
Festival is an elitist sham!

1265
00:59:13,620 --> 00:59:14,940
If you really want to see the cutting edge

1266
00:59:14,940 --> 00:59:16,810
of current cinema, you
should come next door

1267
00:59:16,810 --> 00:59:18,240
to the Mike Dong Film Festival.

1268
00:59:18,240 --> 00:59:19,120
- Excuse me.

1269
00:59:19,120 --> 00:59:20,983
- No, I will not be silenced!

1270
00:59:20,983 --> 00:59:22,474
Vive la difference!

1271
00:59:22,474 --> 00:59:23,741
Vive Le Roi!

1272
00:59:23,741 --> 00:59:25,157
Apres moi, le deluge!

1273
00:59:25,157 --> 00:59:26,540
- I don't wish to silence you.

1274
00:59:26,540 --> 00:59:27,840
I'd like to interview you.

1275
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:29,820
- Oh, I'm sorry.

1276
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:32,130
- So, are you Mike Dong?

1277
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:33,610
- No.

1278
00:59:33,610 --> 00:59:34,930
- Who is Mike Dong?

1279
00:59:34,930 --> 00:59:36,290
- There is no Mike Dong.

1280
00:59:36,290 --> 00:59:37,950
I just thought it was a good pun.

1281
00:59:37,950 --> 00:59:39,400
Mike Dong Festival

1282
00:59:39,400 --> 00:59:40,300
- I see.

1283
00:59:40,300 --> 00:59:42,190
I take it you've started this festival

1284
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:44,810
as a protest to the
Mike Wong Film Festival.

1285
00:59:44,810 --> 00:59:45,660
- That's right.

1286
00:59:45,660 --> 00:59:48,430
My film didn't get into
the Mike Wong Festival,

1287
00:59:48,430 --> 00:59:50,000
probably because I'm from New Jersey,

1288
00:59:50,000 --> 00:59:52,890
where we don't have any elephants!

1289
00:59:52,890 --> 00:59:54,010
- [George] Thank you!

1290
00:59:54,010 --> 00:59:55,440
- Hey, you know the media's always welcome

1291
00:59:55,440 --> 00:59:56,913
at the Mike Dong Festival!

1292
00:59:58,200 --> 00:59:59,523
I'll leave you passes!

1293
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:01,623
Anyone want passes?

1294
01:00:07,660 --> 01:00:09,560
- Excuse me, Mr. Dong.

1295
01:00:09,560 --> 01:00:11,120
- Wong.

1296
01:00:11,120 --> 01:00:12,510
- Uh, right.

1297
01:00:12,510 --> 01:00:14,000
What are the police doing here?

1298
01:00:14,000 --> 01:00:15,070
- I don't know, George.

1299
01:00:15,070 --> 01:00:17,700
They claim that someone
asked them to be here.

1300
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:18,550
It wasn't me, though.

1301
01:00:22,680 --> 01:00:24,280
- What are you doing?

1302
01:00:24,280 --> 01:00:25,940
- I'm shooting a documentary.

1303
01:00:25,940 --> 01:00:27,793
- No, I'm shooting a documentary.

1304
01:00:28,970 --> 01:00:31,570
- I'm shooting a documentary
about your documentary.

1305
01:00:33,240 --> 01:00:34,073
- Great.

1306
01:00:36,529 --> 01:00:37,362
(audience applauds)

1307
01:00:37,362 --> 01:00:39,580
- [George Voiceover] The moment
of truth was nearly upon us.

1308
01:00:39,580 --> 01:00:41,140
One thing was certain:

1309
01:00:41,140 --> 01:00:43,400
After Rosemary's film,
the first prize winner

1310
01:00:43,400 --> 01:00:46,840
would be announced, and
perhaps the killer, as well.

1311
01:00:46,840 --> 01:00:49,130
- So, without further ado,

1312
01:00:49,130 --> 01:00:50,930
I'd like to bring on Rosemary Olsen,

1313
01:00:50,930 --> 01:00:53,320
the director of tonight's short film,

1314
01:00:53,320 --> 01:00:56,390
"Black Roses, Black
Carnations, Black Daisies".

1315
01:00:56,390 --> 01:00:59,753
Rosemary?
(audience applauds)

1316
01:01:01,463 --> 01:01:04,897
- I think it was Orson
Welles who once asked,

1317
01:01:04,897 --> 01:01:06,707
"What the hell was I thinking?"

1318
01:01:08,050 --> 01:01:08,883
Thank you.

1319
01:01:11,832 --> 01:01:13,364
(film projector clicking)

1320
01:01:13,364 --> 01:01:16,364
(smoky jazz music)

1321
01:01:33,240 --> 01:01:36,733
- With this elephant, I thee kill.

1322
01:01:37,860 --> 01:01:39,393
- That is so weird.

1323
01:01:40,280 --> 01:01:42,800
That's exactly how that
Maria woman was killed.

1324
01:01:42,800 --> 01:01:44,260
- Cut the camera, Tori.

1325
01:01:44,260 --> 01:01:46,740
- George, you're letting
your personal feelings

1326
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:48,230
get in the way here.

1327
01:01:48,230 --> 01:01:49,660
Remember who you are.

1328
01:01:49,660 --> 01:01:51,144
Be a professional.

1329
01:01:51,144 --> 01:01:53,727
(George sighs)

1330
01:01:56,738 --> 01:01:59,071
(gun fires)

1331
01:02:01,935 --> 01:02:02,935
- I'm sorry.

1332
01:02:04,250 --> 01:02:05,163
I didn't mean to.

1333
01:02:21,016 --> 01:02:21,849
Whoops.

1334
01:02:26,780 --> 01:02:27,613
I'm sorry.

1335
01:02:29,100 --> 01:02:32,013
But I didn't kill you, your film did.

1336
01:02:53,369 --> 01:02:56,450
- I don't know what to say, Rosemary.

1337
01:02:56,450 --> 01:02:57,820
- [Detective Blank] Excuse me, Mr. Wong.

1338
01:02:57,820 --> 01:02:59,370
- [Arthur] Yes, Detective.

1339
01:02:59,370 --> 01:03:01,490
- I may not know a lot about movies--

1340
01:03:01,490 --> 01:03:03,363
- About film, Detective.

1341
01:03:04,430 --> 01:03:05,323
- About film.

1342
01:03:06,210 --> 01:03:09,130
Maybe I'm just a cop who
found Tarkovsky's last films

1343
01:03:09,130 --> 01:03:13,183
too dry and pedantic, but
I do know what my duty is.

1344
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,923
You have the cinematic flair
of a master, Miss Olsen.

1345
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:22,120
And you have the right to remain silent.

1346
01:03:22,120 --> 01:03:25,420
- You don't understand,
my film is anti-violence.

1347
01:03:25,420 --> 01:03:26,970
- Tell it to the critics, lady.

1348
01:03:31,630 --> 01:03:33,010
- Detective, don't you think

1349
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:35,010
this is censorship of the worst degree?

1350
01:03:35,010 --> 01:03:35,843
You're arresting this woman

1351
01:03:35,843 --> 01:03:37,510
because you didn't like her film.

1352
01:03:37,510 --> 01:03:39,510
- I loved her film.

1353
01:03:39,510 --> 01:03:41,950
But it proves that she
murdered those other directors.

1354
01:03:41,950 --> 01:03:43,340
- Just because her film is about killing

1355
01:03:43,340 --> 01:03:45,010
doesn't make her a murderer.

1356
01:03:45,010 --> 01:03:48,180
By that token, Martin
Scorsese would be a gangster,

1357
01:03:48,180 --> 01:03:50,240
and Woody Allen would be, um...

1358
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:53,233
Oh, never mind.

1359
01:03:54,450 --> 01:03:55,283
- Rosemary!

1360
01:03:56,570 --> 01:03:58,140
I think you should know that your film

1361
01:03:58,140 --> 01:04:00,310
was going to be awarded first place.

1362
01:04:00,310 --> 01:04:02,900
But, given these developments,

1363
01:04:02,900 --> 01:04:05,810
we have to award the money
to the first runner-up.

1364
01:04:05,810 --> 01:04:07,063
Congratulations, George.

1365
01:04:08,070 --> 01:04:10,550
I only wish I'd seen her film earlier.

1366
01:04:10,550 --> 01:04:13,350
Perhaps some of these murders
could have been prevented.

1367
01:04:15,020 --> 01:04:16,620
- Hold on a second!

1368
01:04:16,620 --> 01:04:19,090
Mr. Wong, who judged Rosemary's film?

1369
01:04:19,090 --> 01:04:21,240
- Well, I recused myself

1370
01:04:21,240 --> 01:04:23,770
because Rosemary and my son were close,

1371
01:04:23,770 --> 01:04:25,520
and I don't believe Siobhan

1372
01:04:25,520 --> 01:04:27,737
actually watched any of the films,

1373
01:04:27,737 --> 01:04:29,680
that means Elephant,

1374
01:04:29,680 --> 01:04:31,832
Elliot was the only judge to see it.

1375
01:04:31,832 --> 01:04:34,596
- And Elliot's film is next
on the schedule, isn't it?

1376
01:04:34,596 --> 01:04:36,210
I think we should watch it right now.

1377
01:04:36,210 --> 01:04:37,900
- Do you think I'm crazy?

1378
01:04:37,900 --> 01:04:39,070
Look what happened to the last director

1379
01:04:39,070 --> 01:04:39,970
who showed a film here.

1380
01:04:39,970 --> 01:04:42,083
- Elephant, your award stipulated
that you would have to--

1381
01:04:42,083 --> 01:04:44,670
- I'm not gonna show my
film with any cops around.

1382
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:47,040
They take these things too literally!

1383
01:04:47,040 --> 01:04:48,260
And stop calling me Elephant.

1384
01:04:48,260 --> 01:04:51,257
- Elliot, you're gonna give me that film,

1385
01:04:51,257 --> 01:04:53,220
and we're gonna watch it.

1386
01:04:53,220 --> 01:04:55,960
- Careful, George, you're
becoming part of the story.

1387
01:04:55,960 --> 01:04:56,963
- Screw the story.

1388
01:04:57,990 --> 01:04:59,541
This has to do with the truth.

1389
01:04:59,541 --> 01:05:02,960
(suspenseful music)

1390
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:05,793
(thrilling music)

1391
01:05:21,762 --> 01:05:22,595
(footsteps patter)

1392
01:05:22,595 --> 01:05:24,223
I'll take that film now, Elliot.

1393
01:05:26,285 --> 01:05:27,690
- How dare you.

1394
01:05:27,690 --> 01:05:29,443
You, a filmmaker yourself.

1395
01:05:29,443 --> 01:05:31,927
This is my film, I created it,

1396
01:05:31,927 --> 01:05:34,240
and I don't think the current
climate is right for it!

1397
01:05:34,240 --> 01:05:37,320
- You knew the rules when
you took the money, Elliot.

1398
01:05:37,320 --> 01:05:40,420
A year later you were gonna
have to screen the film.

1399
01:05:40,420 --> 01:05:41,273
Time's up.

1400
01:05:44,043 --> 01:05:46,320
Do the right thing, Elliot.

1401
01:05:46,320 --> 01:05:47,650
- Never!

1402
01:05:47,650 --> 01:05:50,817
(microphone clacking)

1403
01:05:56,224 --> 01:05:58,555
The medium is the message!

1404
01:05:58,555 --> 01:05:59,932
- [Tori] Hey, I said that.

1405
01:05:59,932 --> 01:06:02,010
- Besides, you have to speak

1406
01:06:02,010 --> 01:06:05,120
into the microphone!
(microphone thuds)

1407
01:06:07,650 --> 01:06:08,760
You get all that?

1408
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:10,057
- Yeah, I got it.

1409
01:06:10,954 --> 01:06:12,854
But I don't think the sound is usable.

1410
01:06:17,638 --> 01:06:18,800
- [George Voiceover] For the last time,

1411
01:06:18,800 --> 01:06:20,760
we all gathered in the theater,

1412
01:06:20,760 --> 01:06:22,590
watching the screen for answers,

1413
01:06:22,590 --> 01:06:24,440
hoping that the auteur theory

1414
01:06:24,440 --> 01:06:26,523
had one last trick up its sleeves.

1415
01:06:27,586 --> 01:06:31,670
(film projector clicking)

1416
01:06:31,670 --> 01:06:33,770
- Once upon a time, there was a filmmaker.

1417
01:06:34,610 --> 01:06:37,823
This filmmaker was thought
by some to be a genius.

1418
01:06:37,823 --> 01:06:42,823
(children yelling)
(ominous atonal music)

1419
01:07:09,659 --> 01:07:11,027
(gun fires)

1420
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:13,944
(people screaming)

1421
01:07:17,342 --> 01:07:19,472
- Why did you kill him?

1422
01:07:19,472 --> 01:07:21,920
(static crackling)

1423
01:07:21,920 --> 01:07:25,960
- Yes, some people thought
this filmmaker was a genius.

1424
01:07:25,960 --> 01:07:27,700
And not only did he have talent,

1425
01:07:27,700 --> 01:07:31,360
he had money, money to
make a feature film.

1426
01:07:31,360 --> 01:07:34,710
But, try as he might, this
prodigiously talented filmmaker

1427
01:07:34,710 --> 01:07:38,073
could not find a topic
for his feature film.

1428
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:41,940
Until one day...

1429
01:07:41,940 --> 01:07:45,070
The filmmaker was judging some
short films for a festival,

1430
01:07:45,070 --> 01:07:47,130
while being watched by
one of his classmates,

1431
01:07:47,130 --> 01:07:49,490
a promiscuous Latina filmmaker.

1432
01:07:49,490 --> 01:07:52,980
- Look at you, judging
other people's movies,

1433
01:07:52,980 --> 01:07:54,980
and you don't have an idea for your own.

1434
01:07:56,190 --> 01:08:00,053
Any real artist would know
what to do with that money.

1435
01:08:01,790 --> 01:08:03,060
I can't believe I've been sleeping

1436
01:08:03,060 --> 01:08:05,143
with such an ineffectual putz.

1437
01:08:06,650 --> 01:08:08,020
Why don't you use that money

1438
01:08:08,020 --> 01:08:11,000
to buy yourself a really nice gun,

1439
01:08:11,000 --> 01:08:12,433
and shoot yourself with it?

1440
01:08:13,270 --> 01:08:15,940
Or give me the money, and I'll shoot you,

1441
01:08:15,940 --> 01:08:17,350
you pathetic, little man!

1442
01:08:17,350 --> 01:08:18,276
- Shut up!
(loud thud)

1443
01:08:18,276 --> 01:08:21,026
(dramatic music)

1444
01:08:23,741 --> 01:08:27,057
(smoky jazz music)

1445
01:08:31,539 --> 01:08:34,372
- With this elephant, I thee kill.

1446
01:08:37,097 --> 01:08:39,810
- And then, inspiration.

1447
01:08:39,810 --> 01:08:42,090
He would make a film about murder,

1448
01:08:42,090 --> 01:08:45,310
or, more accurately, he
would make a film about film.

1449
01:08:45,310 --> 01:08:47,810
The filmmaker knew that for
this film to be true to life,

1450
01:08:47,810 --> 01:08:49,660
it would have to be
patterned on real life,

1451
01:08:49,660 --> 01:08:51,310
like his earlier work.

1452
01:08:51,310 --> 01:08:55,230
So-called "real life"
would be reproduced on film

1453
01:08:55,230 --> 01:08:57,810
with younger, more attractive actors.

1454
01:08:57,810 --> 01:09:00,300
But, in this case, a
further wrinkle was added:

1455
01:09:00,300 --> 01:09:01,490
The source film would first

1456
01:09:01,490 --> 01:09:03,240
have to be replicated in real life

1457
01:09:03,240 --> 01:09:05,460
so that real life could then be reproduced

1458
01:09:05,460 --> 01:09:06,503
in the final film.

1459
01:09:08,160 --> 01:09:11,813
Film inspiring reality inspiring film.

1460
01:09:12,840 --> 01:09:16,111
It was all so beautifully

1461
01:09:16,111 --> 01:09:17,169
postmodern

1462
01:09:18,530 --> 01:09:21,730
As in any collaboration,
there was occasional tension.

1463
01:09:21,730 --> 01:09:23,671
- [Bad Chinese accent]
You keep film in festival,

1464
01:09:23,671 --> 01:09:25,004
or I kill again!

1465
01:09:25,004 --> 01:09:25,980
- I can't!

1466
01:09:25,980 --> 01:09:27,490
You're framing me for murder!

1467
01:09:27,490 --> 01:09:28,560
- [Teen Elliot] You keep in,

1468
01:09:28,560 --> 01:09:33,043
or you have more deaths on
your hands, like Mike's.

1469
01:09:34,234 --> 01:09:37,830
- Who are you, you cruel, heartless boy?

1470
01:09:37,830 --> 01:09:39,230
Who are you?!

1471
01:09:39,230 --> 01:09:40,371
- I am...

1472
01:09:42,788 --> 01:09:44,021
Art.

1473
01:09:45,370 --> 01:09:47,713
My name is Art.

1474
01:09:51,260 --> 01:09:54,627
("La Marseillaise")

1475
01:10:03,527 --> 01:10:06,444
(people murmuring)

1476
01:10:11,710 --> 01:10:13,055
- Let's go, Elephant.

1477
01:10:14,620 --> 01:10:16,560
- You people are such literalists!

1478
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,290
Didn't you read the disclaimer?

1479
01:10:18,290 --> 01:10:21,330
- I'm a firm believer in the
doctrine of intentionality.

1480
01:10:21,330 --> 01:10:22,980
- Do you discount Foucault?

1481
01:10:22,980 --> 01:10:24,730
- Well, I don't discount him,

1482
01:10:24,730 --> 01:10:27,220
I simply find his conclusions reductive.

1483
01:10:27,220 --> 01:10:29,320
- Hmm, well, I've tried to reconcile

1484
01:10:29,320 --> 01:10:31,400
the theories of Lacan with Foucault

1485
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:32,720
and the other major deconstructionists,

1486
01:10:32,720 --> 01:10:34,660
and I find, ultimately, it
leads me to the conclusion:

1487
01:10:34,660 --> 01:10:35,493
I must kill.

1488
01:10:35,493 --> 01:10:37,000
- Really?

1489
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:38,582
- Detective, I think this is the beginning

1490
01:10:38,582 --> 01:10:40,270
of a beautiful friendship.

1491
01:10:40,270 --> 01:10:42,160
- I knew all along that he was the killer.

1492
01:10:42,160 --> 01:10:43,660
Never a doubt in my mind.

1493
01:10:43,660 --> 01:10:45,240
- Right, right. Wow.

1494
01:10:45,240 --> 01:10:47,970
- Next year, I'm entering
the Mike Dong Festival.

1495
01:10:47,970 --> 01:10:49,010
- I hear that.

1496
01:10:49,010 --> 01:10:50,410
This festival is not

1497
01:10:50,410 --> 01:10:51,540
what it used to be.
- My next film will be

1498
01:10:51,540 --> 01:10:52,540
about a great white whale

1499
01:10:52,540 --> 01:10:53,477
that wears a paper bag on its head,

1500
01:10:53,477 --> 01:10:55,327
and the captain who's
obsessed with catching him.

1501
01:10:55,327 --> 01:10:58,352
- And the captain wears a
paper back on his head, too?

1502
01:10:58,352 --> 01:10:59,560
- [Unknown Filmmaker] No,
that's where I take it all

1503
01:10:59,560 --> 01:11:00,560
to the next level.

1504
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:03,950
The captain wears a
plastic bag on his head.

1505
01:11:03,950 --> 01:11:05,540
- Oh, that's brilliant.

1506
01:11:05,540 --> 01:11:08,900
Hey, I can guarantee you a
slot in my festival next year!

1507
01:11:08,900 --> 01:11:09,733
Hey!

1508
01:11:15,270 --> 01:11:18,500
- You can't blame yourself
for what happened to Mike.

1509
01:11:18,500 --> 01:11:19,550
- I know I shouldn't.

1510
01:11:20,630 --> 01:11:23,510
And it helped to express
my feelings in the movie.

1511
01:11:23,510 --> 01:11:25,490
We filmmakers, we use our movies

1512
01:11:25,490 --> 01:11:28,120
as substitutes for psychotherapy.

1513
01:11:28,120 --> 01:11:29,253
Costs about the same.

1514
01:11:30,290 --> 01:11:33,420
- Rosemary, I'm terribly sorry.

1515
01:11:33,420 --> 01:11:35,503
Of course, first prize is yours.

1516
01:11:36,750 --> 01:11:38,830
I'm sure you understand, George.

1517
01:11:38,830 --> 01:11:41,590
- My work's not suited
to features, anyway.

1518
01:11:41,590 --> 01:11:43,390
- Thank you, Mr. Wong.

1519
01:11:43,390 --> 01:11:44,903
I accept in memory of Mike.

1520
01:11:48,930 --> 01:11:51,920
- And so, matters came
to a happy conclusion.

1521
01:11:51,920 --> 01:11:54,210
True, Detective Blank's
interpretation of Elliot's film

1522
01:11:54,210 --> 01:11:57,320
was a bit blunt, but,
well, he was a believer

1523
01:11:57,320 --> 01:12:00,390
in the doctrine of
intentionality, after all.

1524
01:12:00,390 --> 01:12:03,163
As for me, I learned an important lesson:

1525
01:12:04,050 --> 01:12:06,733
sometimes a film is just a film.

1526
01:12:09,410 --> 01:12:12,200
- So, whatever happened to you and--

1527
01:12:12,200 --> 01:12:13,243
- Miss Olsen?

1528
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:15,473
- Well...

1529
01:12:16,450 --> 01:12:18,410
- I think you know that I consider you

1530
01:12:18,410 --> 01:12:19,913
more than just a subject.

1531
01:12:22,360 --> 01:12:23,430
- I know, George.

1532
01:12:24,890 --> 01:12:29,423
- I wonder if you might
consider a collaboration.

1533
01:12:31,570 --> 01:12:35,373
- What sort of a collaboration
did you have in mind?

1534
01:12:35,373 --> 01:12:38,043
- A very close collaboration.

1535
01:12:41,115 --> 01:12:43,377
- I could be open to that possibility.

1536
01:12:50,530 --> 01:12:52,083
Of course, I get top billing.

1537
01:12:53,608 --> 01:12:54,441
- Of course.

1538
01:13:04,172 --> 01:13:05,920
(sighs)

1539
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,910
Well, there you have it.

1540
01:13:07,910 --> 01:13:11,650
- I'll grant you, Mr.
Sand, you spin a nice tale.

1541
01:13:11,650 --> 01:13:13,650
But, unfortunately for you,

1542
01:13:13,650 --> 01:13:16,843
I've seen some footage that
tells a very different story.

1543
01:13:18,396 --> 01:13:20,263
Would you please show
in the other gentleman?

1544
01:13:28,980 --> 01:13:29,813
- Sorry.

1545
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,670
I needed finishing funds too.

1546
01:13:39,780 --> 01:13:40,613
- So?

1547
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,350
- [George] There, there, Tori.

1548
01:13:47,350 --> 01:13:49,514
We'll find an audience for our film.

1549
01:13:49,514 --> 01:13:51,140
- [Tori] But where?

1550
01:13:51,140 --> 01:13:53,983
- [George] A place where the
people are truly open-minded.

1551
01:13:54,880 --> 01:13:55,713
America.

1552
01:13:57,030 --> 01:13:58,263
- [Tori] Or Canada?

1553
01:13:59,590 --> 01:14:00,965
- [George] Or Canada.

1554
01:14:03,380 --> 01:14:05,072
- [Tori] What about Chad?

1555
01:14:07,680 --> 01:14:10,763
(apprehensive music)

1556
01:15:10,210 --> 01:15:12,793
(upbeat music)

1557
01:15:37,514 --> 01:15:40,097
(gentle music)

1558
01:16:14,436 --> 01:16:17,436
(suspenseful music)
