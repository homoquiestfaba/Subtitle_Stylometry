1
00:03:14,836 --> 00:03:16,463
Hey, Sailor, wait!

2
00:03:19,874 --> 00:03:21,307
I got something for you.

3
00:03:22,910 --> 00:03:25,401
Marietta tells me you were trying to

4
00:03:25,813 --> 00:03:27,974
fuck her in the toilets.
- Oh, man ...

5
00:03:28,382 --> 00:03:32,045
You crazy bad boy, trying to
fuck your girl's mama!

6
00:03:32,453 --> 00:03:37,288
Tell me: how does
that little cunt Lula feel about that?

7
00:03:37,692 --> 00:03:39,182
You know ...

8
00:03:40,495 --> 00:03:42,759
Marietta gave me this
to kill you.

9
00:03:43,898 --> 00:03:45,627
And then she said
I'd be able to fuck Lula ...

10
00:04:45,726 --> 00:04:49,287
PEE DEE PENITENTIARY

11
00:05:23,631 --> 00:05:25,599
Hello ...?
- Is Lula there?

12
00:05:26,601 --> 00:05:27,625
Who is this?

13
00:05:28,269 --> 00:05:29,702
Sailor Ripley.

14
00:05:30,705 --> 00:05:33,731
Can I ... talk to Lula?

15
00:05:35,109 --> 00:05:37,942
There's no way in hell!

16
00:05:38,346 --> 00:05:42,783
If you even think
about seeing Lula, you're dead. - What?

17
00:05:43,284 --> 00:05:47,983
You heard me.
And don't you ever call here again!

18
00:05:59,133 --> 00:06:00,122
Mama?

19
00:06:02,803 --> 00:06:04,065
You know who that was.

20
00:06:05,339 --> 00:06:07,398
And you know you aren't,

21
00:06:07,808 --> 00:06:11,141
and I mean are not
gonna see him ever.

22
00:06:11,545 --> 00:06:13,513
End of story!

23
00:06:14,815 --> 00:06:16,874
Like hell!

24
00:06:42,743 --> 00:06:44,074
Lula!

25
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:48,813
Sailor!
- Peanut!

26
00:06:49,216 --> 00:06:50,649
Hey baby!

27
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:57,621
I've got a surprise for you!

28
00:06:58,025 --> 00:07:01,961
Hey, my snakeskin jacket!
Thanks, baby! Did I ever tell you

29
00:07:02,363 --> 00:07:07,130
that this jacket is a symbol of my
belief in personal freedom?

30
00:07:07,535 --> 00:07:09,594
About 50,000 times.

31
00:07:10,004 --> 00:07:13,269
I got us a room at
the Cape Fear. And guess what?

32
00:07:13,674 --> 00:07:15,767
"Powermad" is at the "Hurricane"!

33
00:07:16,177 --> 00:07:17,201
Stab it and steer!

34
00:07:56,350 --> 00:08:01,049
Jeez Lou-eez, Sailor,
you are something else ...

35
00:08:03,457 --> 00:08:06,915
When I was 15,
my mama told me

36
00:08:07,328 --> 00:08:09,888
that pretty soon
I'd be starting to think about sex,

37
00:08:10,297 --> 00:08:13,755
and that I should tell her before
I did anything about it.

38
00:08:14,168 --> 00:08:16,102
But I thought
you told me your uncle Pooch

39
00:08:16,504 --> 00:08:18,802
raped you
when you was 13?

40
00:08:20,307 --> 00:08:21,899
True.

41
00:08:22,309 --> 00:08:24,539
Uncle Pooch wasn't really an uncle.

42
00:08:24,945 --> 00:08:28,381
He was
a business partner of my daddy's.

43
00:08:30,084 --> 00:08:32,882
Mama never knew 'bout me and him ...

44
00:08:33,287 --> 00:08:35,278
that's for damn sure.

45
00:08:36,657 --> 00:08:39,683
You know what?
You're a pumpkin.

46
00:08:52,306 --> 00:08:54,001
Oh, my God! Get out!

47
00:09:14,995 --> 00:09:17,293
Uncle Pooch died
in a car crash 3 months later,

48
00:09:17,698 --> 00:09:19,359
on holiday in Myrtle Beach.

49
00:09:20,267 --> 00:09:22,827
They still got
way too much traffic there.

50
00:09:23,237 --> 00:09:25,797
Have you been
noticin' the buildup in traffic?

51
00:09:26,207 --> 00:09:27,640
Here she goes again.

52
00:09:28,042 --> 00:09:29,066
I'm sorry, Sailor,

53
00:09:29,677 --> 00:09:33,010
but that ozone layer is disappearin'.

54
00:09:33,414 --> 00:09:35,245
One of these mornings, the sun's gonna

55
00:09:35,649 --> 00:09:39,210
burn a hole clean through the earth
like an electrical X-ray.

56
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,019
That won't happen, honey.

57
00:09:41,489 --> 00:09:44,458
At least not in our lifetime.
And by then,

58
00:09:44,859 --> 00:09:46,986
they'll be driving Buicks to the moon.

59
00:09:59,206 --> 00:10:00,195
You OK, honey?

60
00:10:01,208 --> 00:10:04,200
That woman's laugh
creeps me out.

61
00:10:06,313 --> 00:10:08,611
Like something I've heard before.

62
00:10:10,417 --> 00:10:12,248
Sounded like the Wicked Witch.

63
00:10:12,653 --> 00:10:14,814
Just sounded like an old gal
having a good time to me.

64
00:10:15,222 --> 00:10:17,213
You ready to go dancing?

65
00:10:17,625 --> 00:10:19,923
I'm always ready to dance.

66
00:10:20,327 --> 00:10:24,229
But I need my kiss first.
Just one!

67
00:10:39,914 --> 00:10:45,614
I'm gonna hire me a hit man, if you
don't help me stop this thing.

68
00:10:47,988 --> 00:10:51,014
I'm going to call Marcello Santos.

69
00:10:53,894 --> 00:10:57,762
Marietta, I am gonna help you.

70
00:10:58,165 --> 00:11:00,360
So don't get carried away.

71
00:11:00,768 --> 00:11:03,498
You don't want
to bring Santos and his bunch into this.

72
00:11:04,038 --> 00:11:08,099
You're just jealous of him
'cause he's still sweet on me.

73
00:11:11,946 --> 00:11:13,436
You been seeing him again?

74
00:11:13,847 --> 00:11:15,838
Oh my God,

75
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:18,013
I don't believe this!

76
00:11:18,986 --> 00:11:20,419
Johnnie Farragut ...

77
00:11:21,622 --> 00:11:26,150
who doesn't even trust
his very own Marietta?

78
00:11:29,230 --> 00:11:32,165
Alright, I'm sorry honey, but ...

79
00:11:33,934 --> 00:11:34,992
I just love you,

80
00:11:35,569 --> 00:11:37,969
and it just brings out ...

81
00:11:38,372 --> 00:11:42,308
That ugly jealous side,
I hate it, God!

82
00:12:02,496 --> 00:12:04,589
No tongue! My lipstick.

83
00:12:06,400 --> 00:12:11,497
Sweetheart, I want you
to stop worrying about me,

84
00:12:11,905 --> 00:12:17,935
and start worryin' about
how to get Lula from that murderer.

85
00:12:18,345 --> 00:12:20,506
Honey, wait a minute now:

86
00:12:20,914 --> 00:12:22,609
Sailor ain't no murderer.

87
00:12:23,083 --> 00:12:26,246
Now listen to me!
You gotta get off that kick.

88
00:12:26,654 --> 00:12:31,250
As far as I know, Sailor was
all clean before he got involved in

89
00:12:31,659 --> 00:12:33,456
in that event with Lula.

90
00:12:33,861 --> 00:12:35,692
And even there,
he was trying to protect her.

91
00:12:36,096 --> 00:12:39,759
That crazy Bob Ray Lemon was
comin' at them with a knife.

92
00:12:40,167 --> 00:12:42,761
He could've killed both of them.
You oughtta be thankin' him!

93
00:12:43,170 --> 00:12:44,797
I don't know why I'm telling you this.

94
00:12:45,205 --> 00:12:48,003
You were there,
you saw the whole damned thing!

95
00:12:48,409 --> 00:12:49,706
Didn't you?

96
00:13:17,204 --> 00:13:19,001
Sailor boy!

97
00:13:27,614 --> 00:13:30,583
How'd you like

98
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:33,418
to fuck Lula's mama?

99
00:13:33,987 --> 00:13:36,353
No ... ma'am ...

100
00:13:36,757 --> 00:13:42,593
I sure don't.
- Lula's mama would like to fuck you.

101
00:13:43,330 --> 00:13:48,563
Mrs. Fortune, I really think
you need a cup of coffee.

102
00:13:49,903 --> 00:13:52,929
Maybe I was there.

103
00:13:53,340 --> 00:13:55,900
But I didn't see anything at all.

104
00:13:56,310 --> 00:13:59,473
All I know is,
is that trash,

105
00:13:59,847 --> 00:14:02,714
he killed a man
with his bare hands,

106
00:14:03,083 --> 00:14:08,020
hands that are probably
all over my baby right now!

107
00:14:08,856 --> 00:14:11,290
Oh, honey, settle down.

108
00:14:14,194 --> 00:14:15,991
It's all right, come on now.

109
00:14:17,564 --> 00:14:18,588
It's alright.

110
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:21,661
Now listen, I want
what's best for her too.

111
00:14:22,069 --> 00:14:26,028
I'll do everything I can
to bring her back home, OK?

112
00:14:45,092 --> 00:14:48,084
Baby, quit bouncing.
I got one more toe to do.

113
00:14:48,929 --> 00:14:50,954
Let's go dancing, Peanut!

114
00:14:51,365 --> 00:14:52,730
I'm ready.

115
00:14:54,868 --> 00:14:55,926
But we better be careful.

116
00:14:56,336 --> 00:15:00,238
Mama's gonna
have Johnnie Farragut after us.

117
00:15:00,641 --> 00:15:04,077
He's one clever detective.
You know how clever?

118
00:15:04,478 --> 00:15:06,446
How clever?
- He told me once,

119
00:15:06,847 --> 00:15:09,407
he could find
an honest man in Washington.

120
00:15:11,652 --> 00:15:16,453
I just want two more moments,
then my toes will be dry.

121
00:15:17,624 --> 00:15:20,650
One thing puzzles me, sugar.
- What's that?

122
00:15:21,061 --> 00:15:22,528
You're 20 years old.

123
00:15:23,063 --> 00:15:26,294
Ain't you ever curious as to why
your mama wants to keep us apart ?

124
00:15:30,204 --> 00:15:32,104
I'll tell you, Lula ...

125
00:15:35,742 --> 00:15:38,711
it's more than
me killing Bob Ray Lemon.

126
00:15:40,314 --> 00:15:44,648
Maybe my mama
cares for me just a little too much.

127
00:15:45,819 --> 00:15:47,286
Yeah, maybe.

128
00:15:50,524 --> 00:15:53,982
I just want
to kiss you goodbye.

129
00:15:54,394 --> 00:15:57,921
You know too much about Lula's Mama.

130
00:15:58,332 --> 00:15:59,822
What do you mean?

131
00:16:00,234 --> 00:16:05,035
Johnnie told me
you were a driver for Marcello Santos.

132
00:16:05,439 --> 00:16:08,499
So what?
- So maybe one night,

133
00:16:08,909 --> 00:16:10,740
you got too close to a fire.

134
00:16:12,412 --> 00:16:17,406
So maybe you're gonna burn.
Besides, you're shit.

135
00:16:18,218 --> 00:16:19,617
You think I'd let my little girl

136
00:16:20,020 --> 00:16:23,183
hang out with a piece
of s-h-i-t like you?

137
00:16:23,557 --> 00:16:27,755
Kid, you belong
in one of these toilets!

138
00:16:29,596 --> 00:16:34,465
You piece of white trash!

139
00:16:34,868 --> 00:16:35,994
You ...

140
00:16:42,976 --> 00:16:45,467
You're gonna have to kill me
to keep me away from Lula.

141
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:50,282
Don't worry about that.
First I'm gonna cut your balls off

142
00:16:50,684 --> 00:16:52,276
and feed them to you.

143
00:16:55,289 --> 00:16:57,280
You're gonna have to kill me.

144
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,118
I can arrange that.

145
00:17:03,630 --> 00:17:06,622
It's a problem I don't think
is gonna go away too soon.

146
00:17:07,634 --> 00:17:11,764
I'm ready to break parole
and take you out to sunny California!

147
00:17:12,172 --> 00:17:15,141
Sailor!
- You up for that?

148
00:17:15,776 --> 00:17:18,404
I'd go to the far end
of the world for you, baby.

149
00:17:18,812 --> 00:17:20,211
You know that.

150
00:17:20,948 --> 00:17:22,916
Rockin' good news!

151
00:17:27,421 --> 00:17:30,049
Are those toenails about dry yet,
sweetheart?

152
00:17:30,457 --> 00:17:32,357
We've got some dancing to do!

153
00:18:25,812 --> 00:18:28,508
You gonna give me the
opportunity to prove my love to my girl?

154
00:18:29,182 --> 00:18:34,449
Or you gonna save yourself
some trouble and apologize to her?

155
00:18:36,256 --> 00:18:38,554
Don't fuck with me, man.

156
00:18:44,731 --> 00:18:46,790
You look like a clown
in that stupid jacket.

157
00:18:47,234 --> 00:18:49,429
This is a snakeskin jacket..

158
00:18:49,836 --> 00:18:52,396
It's a symbol of my individuality

159
00:18:52,806 --> 00:18:55,639
and my belief
in personal freedom.

160
00:18:57,878 --> 00:18:59,004
Asshole!

161
00:19:00,781 --> 00:19:03,215
Come here!
- Sailor, honey ...

162
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,283
I'm sorry to do this to you
here in front of a crowd and all...

163
00:19:10,691 --> 00:19:12,886
But I want you to get up
and apologize to my girl.

164
00:19:19,966 --> 00:19:21,331
I'm sorry.

165
00:19:22,636 --> 00:19:27,005
You just bumped against
the wrong girl, that's all.

166
00:19:28,909 --> 00:19:30,774
Get yourself a beer.

167
00:19:31,878 --> 00:19:34,506
You fellas have
a lot of the same power "E" had.

168
00:19:34,915 --> 00:19:36,542
Do you know this one?

169
00:21:49,049 --> 00:21:53,383
Sail', how come you didn't
sing me "Love me tender"?

170
00:21:54,187 --> 00:21:56,712
You told me
that was your favorite love song.

171
00:21:57,123 --> 00:22:01,321
I told you I'd only sing
"Love me tender" to my wife.

172
00:22:22,983 --> 00:22:25,577
Did you ever think something ...

173
00:22:26,586 --> 00:22:28,679
you can hear a wind ...

174
00:22:29,689 --> 00:22:32,419
and see the Wicked Witch of the East
come flyin' in?

175
00:22:38,999 --> 00:22:41,524
I really did miss your mind
while I was out at Pee Dee.

176
00:22:42,769 --> 00:22:44,828
The rest of your too, of course.

177
00:22:45,238 --> 00:22:49,004
But the way your head works
is God's mystery.

178
00:22:50,043 --> 00:22:51,271
What were you thinking?

179
00:22:55,181 --> 00:22:58,241
Well, I was thinking
about smoking, actually.

180
00:22:59,352 --> 00:23:01,877
My mama smokes Merits now.

181
00:23:02,289 --> 00:23:04,917
She used to smoke Viceroys.

182
00:23:05,525 --> 00:23:08,255
I started stealing
'em from her about 6th grade.

183
00:23:09,129 --> 00:23:11,529
When did you start smoking, Sail'?

184
00:23:13,533 --> 00:23:16,127
I started when I was about ...

185
00:23:17,137 --> 00:23:18,604
four.

186
00:23:20,006 --> 00:23:22,566
My mom was already
dead then from lung cancer.

187
00:23:23,243 --> 00:23:27,339
What brand did she smoke?
- Marlboros, same as me.

188
00:23:27,914 --> 00:23:30,314
I guess both my mom
and my daddy died

189
00:23:30,717 --> 00:23:32,651
of smoke
or alcohol related illness.

190
00:23:33,186 --> 00:23:35,916
Jeez, Sail', I'm sorry.
- Its OK, honey.

191
00:23:36,890 --> 00:23:39,358
I hardly used to see them anyways.

192
00:23:39,759 --> 00:23:42,990
I didn't have much
parental guidance.

193
00:23:43,396 --> 00:23:47,230
The public defender
kept saying that.

194
00:23:48,868 --> 00:23:51,837
He was a good ol' boy,
he stood by me.

195
00:23:53,306 --> 00:23:57,037
I'd stand by you, Sail',

196
00:23:57,444 --> 00:23:58,809
through anything.

197
00:23:59,946 --> 00:24:01,607
Hell, Peanut ...

198
00:24:04,217 --> 00:24:09,883
You stuck by me after
I planted Bob Ray Lemon.

199
00:24:10,290 --> 00:24:13,020
A man can't ask for more than that.

200
00:24:15,562 --> 00:24:17,291
You move me, Sail'.

201
00:24:18,298 --> 00:24:20,095
You really do.

202
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:24,269
You mark me the deepest.

203
00:24:30,343 --> 00:24:32,573
You're perfect for me too.

204
00:24:36,116 --> 00:24:39,017
You remind me of my daddy.

205
00:24:40,653 --> 00:24:42,245
Mama told me
he liked skinny women

206
00:24:42,655 --> 00:24:45,453
with breasts
that stood up and said "Hello".

207
00:24:49,329 --> 00:24:52,594
He had a long nose too,
just like yours.

208
00:24:54,567 --> 00:24:57,764
Did I ever tell you
how my daddy died?

209
00:24:58,705 --> 00:25:01,105
In a fire, as I recall.

210
00:25:01,875 --> 00:25:03,069
Yeah ...

211
00:25:03,977 --> 00:25:07,811
Mama told me he poured
kerosene all over himself,

212
00:25:09,115 --> 00:25:11,345
and lit a match.

213
00:25:32,005 --> 00:25:34,997
That was the year
before I met you.

214
00:25:58,765 --> 00:26:00,426
No, I haven't found them yet.

215
00:26:00,834 --> 00:26:04,395
Just try to take it easy.
- Johnnie!

216
00:26:04,804 --> 00:26:08,240
I'm going to stay
right here, by this telephone,

217
00:26:08,641 --> 00:26:11,906
until you find Lula.
And then I'm coming to get her.

218
00:26:12,312 --> 00:26:14,780
So call me the second
you get to New Orleans.

219
00:26:15,181 --> 00:26:17,843
I will, honey.
- Please don't let me down again!

220
00:26:18,251 --> 00:26:21,049
I'll miss you.
- Get going! - OK. Bye.

221
00:26:21,454 --> 00:26:23,319
Bye, honey.

222
00:26:41,641 --> 00:26:44,371
Well, I guess you
broke parole now.

223
00:26:44,777 --> 00:26:46,210
You guess?

224
00:26:46,613 --> 00:26:51,209
My parole was broke 200 miles back,
when we burned Portagee County.

225
00:26:56,456 --> 00:26:59,516
I guess I'll send Mama
a postcard from somewhere.

226
00:26:59,926 --> 00:27:02,554
I don't want
her to worry more than necessary.

227
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:06,192
That's not why I
called you here, Santos.

228
00:27:06,900 --> 00:27:08,390
That don't smell like a Kool.

229
00:27:08,801 --> 00:27:12,293
It ain't.
It's part of the lessons of life.

230
00:27:13,406 --> 00:27:15,397
Just tell me what you want.

231
00:27:15,842 --> 00:27:20,973
You ain't gonna start worrying
about what's bad for you?

232
00:27:21,381 --> 00:27:26,216
I mean, here you are, crossing
state lines with a real murderer ...

233
00:27:26,619 --> 00:27:29,986
A manslaughterer, honey,
not murderer. Don't exaggerate.

234
00:27:30,390 --> 00:27:32,517
OK, manslaughterer ...

235
00:27:32,926 --> 00:27:37,954
who just broke parole and has only
immoral purposes in mind,

236
00:27:38,364 --> 00:27:41,197
as far as you're concerned.
- Thank the Lord!

237
00:27:41,601 --> 00:27:44,126
Well, you ain't
let me down yet.. Sail'.

238
00:27:44,537 --> 00:27:48,303
That's more than
I can say for the rest of the world.

239
00:27:48,708 --> 00:27:51,643
You please me too, Peanut

240
00:27:53,346 --> 00:27:58,613
You want me to shoot
Sailor in the brains, with a gun.

241
00:27:59,586 --> 00:28:00,610
Yes.

242
00:28:02,388 --> 00:28:05,050
In the forehead?
- Yes.

243
00:28:05,458 --> 00:28:07,016
Wrong!

244
00:28:07,660 --> 00:28:11,323
It's always better to blow a hole
through the back of the head.

245
00:28:11,731 --> 00:28:13,028
Right through ...

246
00:28:13,433 --> 00:28:15,401
to the nose.

247
00:28:17,470 --> 00:28:20,030
Lots of irreparable damage.

248
00:28:22,942 --> 00:28:24,432
See?

249
00:28:25,211 --> 00:28:27,543
I knew
you had it under control.

250
00:28:27,947 --> 00:28:31,383
You are a little slow, but
you're beginning to get it.

251
00:28:33,253 --> 00:28:36,620
Why didn't you send
Johnnie Farragut?

252
00:28:37,023 --> 00:28:38,217
Maybe I did.

253
00:28:40,693 --> 00:28:43,184
Why don't you
look in New Orleans?

254
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:47,362
Lula always talks about that town.
- On one condition:

255
00:28:49,569 --> 00:28:52,003
You give me permission
to kill Johnnie Farragut.

256
00:28:52,405 --> 00:28:54,100
Santos, please!

257
00:28:55,041 --> 00:28:57,032
You're not telling me
you're that sweet on him?

258
00:28:57,510 --> 00:28:59,307
What? No ...
- Are you that sweet on him?

259
00:28:59,712 --> 00:29:02,408
No, but ...
- One day he's gonna find out

260
00:29:02,815 --> 00:29:06,410
what we're up to with Mr. Reindeer,
and he can cause us a lot of trouble.

261
00:29:10,390 --> 00:29:12,255
I'll take your silence as a "yes".

262
00:29:12,659 --> 00:29:15,924
No, ... no, Santos ...
- Shhh, it's OK.

263
00:29:16,329 --> 00:29:18,559
It's alright.
- No! You're not gonna kill him!

264
00:29:19,399 --> 00:29:22,459
You're not gonna kill him!
- No, no ...

265
00:29:24,270 --> 00:29:28,400
No, not Johnnie.
You kill Sailor!

266
00:29:29,242 --> 00:29:32,370
I am going to kill Sailor.

267
00:29:33,212 --> 00:29:35,544
You can be certain of that.

268
00:29:50,730 --> 00:29:53,756
Hello, Mr. Reindeer.
Marcello Santos speaking.

269
00:29:55,134 --> 00:29:59,434
Mr. Marcello Santos. Hey there!

270
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:03,170
That was great shit
you sent last in last month.

271
00:30:06,112 --> 00:30:07,807
I've got a problem.

272
00:30:08,848 --> 00:30:10,907
A couple of problems, in fact.

273
00:30:11,351 --> 00:30:13,376
A couple of problems?

274
00:30:14,387 --> 00:30:19,154
For each problem, drop a
silver dollar through my mail slot.

275
00:30:19,559 --> 00:30:21,151
With all particulars.

276
00:30:22,128 --> 00:30:25,120
We'll work out
"il conto" later.

277
00:30:26,199 --> 00:30:28,360
Have a beautiful day!

278
00:30:37,276 --> 00:30:38,971
We are.

279
00:30:58,131 --> 00:31:01,430
Keep them panties up,
we're in Jimmy Swaggart country!

280
00:31:23,289 --> 00:31:24,415
You know what?

281
00:31:24,824 --> 00:31:28,123
That little bitch Susie
stole my comb.

282
00:31:29,529 --> 00:31:31,258
I hate that.

283
00:31:31,664 --> 00:31:33,359
The stupid little shit!

284
00:31:33,766 --> 00:31:35,199
Phone's ringing.

285
00:31:44,944 --> 00:31:45,933
Juana.

286
00:31:46,345 --> 00:31:49,803
A couple of silver dollars
came my way today.

287
00:31:50,216 --> 00:31:53,811
I'm sending one to you,
with a paper on the beneficiary.

288
00:31:54,220 --> 00:31:57,519
As usual, you are completely free
to fulfill the obligation

289
00:31:57,924 --> 00:32:00,950
in any manner you so desire.

290
00:32:01,627 --> 00:32:04,323
In fact, send
Reggie and Drop Shadow over,

291
00:32:04,730 --> 00:32:06,561
for the silver dollar
and the papers.

292
00:32:06,966 --> 00:32:08,024
Now.

293
00:32:08,434 --> 00:32:13,872
They're on their way.
Who's getting' the second silver dollar?

294
00:32:14,273 --> 00:32:15,797
That's for me to know.

295
00:32:16,242 --> 00:32:17,675
Yeah?

296
00:32:18,678 --> 00:32:20,305
Thanks, Mr. Reindeer.

297
00:32:20,713 --> 00:32:23,739
Have fun, darling.

298
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,431
How you doin', my boy?

299
00:33:37,256 --> 00:33:42,023
Sometimes, when we're making love,

300
00:33:42,428 --> 00:33:47,297
you just about take me
right over that rainbow.

301
00:33:47,700 --> 00:33:52,194
You're so aware of what goes on in me,
I mean, you pay attention.

302
00:33:52,605 --> 00:33:55,870
And I swear, baby,
you got the sweetest cock.

303
00:33:56,309 --> 00:34:00,609
It's like it's talking to me
when you're inside.

304
00:34:02,315 --> 00:34:04,442
You get right on me.

305
00:34:06,018 --> 00:34:09,818
You are dangerously cute, baby,
I got to admit it.

306
00:34:12,892 --> 00:34:15,861
Let's go out
into the crazy world of New Orleans!

307
00:34:16,929 --> 00:34:20,023
Let's get a fried banana sandwich.

308
00:34:29,241 --> 00:34:32,677
That's about the cutest
thing I've ever seen.

309
00:35:09,382 --> 00:35:14,479
Pigeons spread diseases and
mess up the place. You've seen it.

310
00:35:36,042 --> 00:35:37,566
The big N.O.!

311
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,845
Santos? I don't know ...

312
00:35:44,550 --> 00:35:46,814
I'm having second thoughts.

313
00:35:47,219 --> 00:35:49,449
Guess what?

314
00:35:49,855 --> 00:35:53,313
There's no turnin' back,
remember?

315
00:35:54,126 --> 00:35:57,789
I'm in a killing mood.
- Santos!

316
00:35:58,197 --> 00:36:03,134
I saw your boyfriend on Bourbon Street.
- I'm not sure ...

317
00:36:03,669 --> 00:36:06,467
What? Are you in New Orleans?

318
00:36:06,872 --> 00:36:08,863
Crazy fucking bitch!

319
00:36:35,768 --> 00:36:37,167
Ladies!

320
00:36:37,570 --> 00:36:39,470
What are you?

321
00:36:40,106 --> 00:36:43,269
You're not just a pretty face
with a fucking smile.

322
00:36:43,676 --> 00:36:45,735
You're here
to make Mr. Reindeer happy.

323
00:36:46,145 --> 00:36:48,113
And to show him a good time.

324
00:36:49,081 --> 00:36:52,847
Do not bring misfortune
upon yourselves.

325
00:37:12,204 --> 00:37:13,432
When I gave you
the silver dollar, I forgot

326
00:37:13,839 --> 00:37:16,501
to include
the contents of this envelope.

327
00:37:16,909 --> 00:37:18,774
They are to be returned.

328
00:37:20,412 --> 00:37:24,178
Show it just before the deed.

329
00:38:37,122 --> 00:38:40,922
I knew I had an important lesson
to learn that day.

330
00:38:41,327 --> 00:38:45,593
When she got to the top step,
I stuck my hand between her legs.

331
00:38:45,998 --> 00:38:49,365
Baby, what a bad boy you are!

332
00:38:50,803 --> 00:38:53,033
Baby, what a bad boy you are!

333
00:38:54,106 --> 00:38:55,971
That's just what she said.

334
00:38:56,775 --> 00:39:01,075
I had a boner with a capital "O".

335
00:39:01,614 --> 00:39:03,445
Anyway, I found her lying

336
00:39:03,849 --> 00:39:07,250
in a room filled with
guns and porno magazines.

337
00:39:07,653 --> 00:39:11,089
So, I slid
my hand between her legs again,

338
00:39:12,091 --> 00:39:14,218
and she closed her thighs.

339
00:39:14,627 --> 00:39:16,094
You're exciting me, honey.

340
00:39:16,495 --> 00:39:18,292
Then what did she do?

341
00:39:18,697 --> 00:39:21,894
Her face was
half pushed into the pillow,

342
00:39:22,301 --> 00:39:26,863
and I remember, she looked back
over her shoulder at me and said:

343
00:39:27,273 --> 00:39:30,003
"I won't suck you.
Don't ask me to suck you."

344
00:39:30,442 --> 00:39:32,842
Poor baby, she doesn't know
what she missed.

345
00:39:33,245 --> 00:39:36,305
What color hair did she have?
- Jet black,

346
00:39:36,916 --> 00:39:38,611
but gentlemen prefer blondes.

347
00:39:39,018 --> 00:39:41,213
Anyway, dig this:

348
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:43,212
She turns over,

349
00:39:44,223 --> 00:39:47,124
peels off them orange pants,

350
00:39:47,526 --> 00:39:50,757
spreads her legs
real wide

351
00:39:51,163 --> 00:39:54,496
and says to me:
"Take a bite of peach."

352
00:39:54,900 --> 00:39:59,667
Jesus, honey, you more than
sort of got what you come for.

353
00:40:02,274 --> 00:40:05,072
Baby, you better run me
back to the hotel.

354
00:40:05,477 --> 00:40:08,344
You've got me hotter
than Georgia asphalt.

355
00:40:08,747 --> 00:40:10,612
Say no more,
but go easy on me, sweetheart,

356
00:40:11,016 --> 00:40:13,416
tomorrow we got
a lot of driving to do.

357
00:40:17,323 --> 00:40:19,223
Hotter than Georgia asphalt.

358
00:41:31,296 --> 00:41:36,359
Wouldn't it be fabulous
if we someway stayed in love forever?

359
00:41:38,404 --> 00:41:42,568
You think of the weirdest damn things
to say sometimes, Peanut.

360
00:41:42,975 --> 00:41:46,240
Ain't we been
doing a pretty fair job thus far?

361
00:41:46,645 --> 00:41:50,206
Oh, you know exactly
what I mean, sugar.

362
00:41:50,616 --> 00:41:55,076
It'd make the future so simple and nice.

363
00:41:55,487 --> 00:41:56,886
I've done a few things

364
00:41:58,791 --> 00:42:01,316
in my life
which I ain't too proud of.

365
00:42:01,727 --> 00:42:07,393
But from now on I ain't
gonna do nothin' for no good reason.

366
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:10,462
All I know for sure is
there's more than a few bad ideas

367
00:42:10,869 --> 00:42:12,359
runnin' loose out there.

368
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:20,470
There's something
I ain't never told you about.

369
00:42:22,781 --> 00:42:26,842
This here's a story with a lesson
about bad ideas.

370
00:42:27,252 --> 00:42:28,276
What's that?

371
00:42:28,687 --> 00:42:33,283
Well, my cousin Dell was
always fighting bad ideas.

372
00:42:33,692 --> 00:42:37,526
See, Dell loved Christmas.
We used to call him

373
00:42:37,930 --> 00:42:39,295
"Jingle Dell".

374
00:42:39,698 --> 00:42:42,292
He wanted
Christmas to last all year long.

375
00:42:42,701 --> 00:42:46,569
He sure would scream
when his mom told him it was summer,

376
00:42:46,972 --> 00:42:49,873
and Christmas was
six months off.

377
00:42:52,578 --> 00:42:54,011
Also, he said ...

378
00:42:56,014 --> 00:42:59,973
he felt there's men

379
00:43:00,385 --> 00:43:03,582
with black rubber gloves who were
following him around.

380
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:08,286
Dell said that trust in the spirit of
Christmas was destroyed

381
00:43:08,694 --> 00:43:13,654
by ideas being controlled
by aliens wearing black gloves.

382
00:43:14,032 --> 00:43:17,798
These aliens would get Dell
to do all kinds of things.

383
00:43:18,370 --> 00:43:21,567
Then he'd carry on about the weather,

384
00:43:21,974 --> 00:43:26,172
talk about how rainfall is
controlled by aliens on earth.

385
00:43:26,879 --> 00:43:30,337
Aunt Rootie told him
that one day he would realize

386
00:43:30,749 --> 00:43:34,207
that the alien wearing
the black gloves was him,

387
00:43:34,620 --> 00:43:36,451
and him alone.

388
00:43:39,658 --> 00:43:44,288
Sounds like old Dell
was more than just a bit confused.

389
00:43:46,698 --> 00:43:48,928
Dell was learning a hard lesson.

390
00:43:49,334 --> 00:43:53,031
It got so he would stay up
all night making sandwiches.

391
00:43:54,806 --> 00:43:56,364
Dell, what are you doing?

392
00:44:04,516 --> 00:44:06,347
I'm making my lunch!

393
00:44:07,953 --> 00:44:11,514
Mama told me
Aunt Rootie, that's Dell's mama,

394
00:44:13,992 --> 00:44:16,483
found cockroaches in Dell's underwear.

395
00:44:17,996 --> 00:44:20,556
One time, she found Dell

396
00:44:20,966 --> 00:44:23,594
putting one big cockroach
on his anus.

397
00:44:24,002 --> 00:44:25,765
Hell, Peanut!

398
00:44:31,543 --> 00:44:33,636
It ain't so funny now, though.

399
00:44:35,080 --> 00:44:36,945
Dell disappeared.

400
00:44:37,349 --> 00:44:39,214
Nobody's seen him since.

401
00:44:41,186 --> 00:44:44,314
Too bad he couldn't visit

402
00:44:44,723 --> 00:44:48,819
that old Wizard of Oz,

403
00:44:49,828 --> 00:44:52,058
and get some good advice.

404
00:44:53,865 --> 00:44:56,493
Too bad
we all can't, baby.

405
00:45:13,352 --> 00:45:15,479
Are you there, Johnnie?

406
00:45:15,887 --> 00:45:17,980
What's wrong, honey?

407
00:45:23,562 --> 00:45:26,929
Johnnie, sweetheart.
Wait, I've got something to tell you.

408
00:45:27,332 --> 00:45:30,893
I want you to know something.

409
00:45:31,270 --> 00:45:34,000
I've done something so bad,
real bad.

410
00:45:34,406 --> 00:45:38,137
What?
- Not on the phone! No ...

411
00:45:38,543 --> 00:45:42,309
I'm coming to New Orleans tomorrow
to tell you in person. OK?

412
00:45:42,714 --> 00:45:47,378
Don't do this to me. You'd freak out
if I did that to you. Now what is it?

413
00:45:49,054 --> 00:45:51,113
No,
I'm not gonna tell you on the phone.

414
00:45:51,523 --> 00:45:54,686
But honey, I gotta leave right now
and get on their trail.

415
00:45:55,093 --> 00:45:58,688
The kids were here. They checked
out of the Hotel Brazil this morning.

416
00:45:59,197 --> 00:46:00,858
No!

417
00:46:01,233 --> 00:46:03,201
Stay right there! Don't go anywhere!

418
00:46:03,602 --> 00:46:06,127
I'm coming in on Piedmont
tomorrow, on the 7 o'clock flight.

419
00:46:07,072 --> 00:46:12,840
We're going after Lula together!
- OK, if that's what you want.

420
00:46:13,245 --> 00:46:15,145
But I'm against it!

421
00:46:16,581 --> 00:46:18,139
7 o'clock,

422
00:46:18,550 --> 00:46:20,415
tomorrow evening. Sugar, ...

423
00:46:20,819 --> 00:46:23,219
We'll have dinner at our
favorite French restaurant, OK?

424
00:46:23,622 --> 00:46:26,887
You fix it up. OK, bye now?

425
00:46:27,893 --> 00:46:29,360
I love you.

426
00:46:31,396 --> 00:46:32,863
Marietta?

427
00:47:45,637 --> 00:47:48,037
How much we got left, baby?

428
00:47:48,440 --> 00:47:50,032
Under 100.

429
00:47:50,442 --> 00:47:52,433
You want me to drive

430
00:47:52,844 --> 00:47:56,678
so you can get a bit of rest?
- Yeah, that'd be good.

431
00:48:13,064 --> 00:48:17,125
Come in, San Antonio, Texas.
What's on your mind this evening?

432
00:48:17,569 --> 00:48:20,129
I just had triple bypass,
open-heart surgery,

433
00:48:20,539 --> 00:48:24,236
and it's people like you who make me
wanna get out of the hospital ...

434
00:48:24,643 --> 00:48:27,077
How can anyone listen to this crap?

435
00:48:27,779 --> 00:48:30,942
... for her recent divorce, shot
her three children, aged seven ...

436
00:48:32,517 --> 00:48:33,506
A judge

437
00:48:33,919 --> 00:48:36,683
praised defendant John Roy,
but was dismayed to learn

438
00:48:37,088 --> 00:48:39,386
that he'd had sex with the corpse.

439
00:48:39,825 --> 00:48:41,019
What?

440
00:48:42,627 --> 00:48:45,255
State authorities, last October
released 500 turtles ino the Ganges,

441
00:48:45,664 --> 00:48:47,894
to try and reduce human pollution,

442
00:48:48,300 --> 00:48:51,235
and will now use crocodiles to eat
corpses dumped by poor Hindus ...

443
00:48:51,636 --> 00:48:56,300
Holy shit!
It's Night of the Living Dead!

444
00:48:57,342 --> 00:49:00,436
What's that, Peanut?
- I can't take any more of this radio!

445
00:49:00,846 --> 00:49:03,576
I've never heard
so much shit in all my life!

446
00:49:03,982 --> 00:49:08,180
Sailor Ripley, you get me
some music now! I mean it!

447
00:49:08,587 --> 00:49:11,181
... victim of a sexual assault ...
... mutilated ... raped ...

448
00:50:30,302 --> 00:50:34,204
Johnnie, I can't tell you now,
honey, but listen:

449
00:50:34,606 --> 00:50:38,633
Is there any way, any way
that we could get on the road tonight?

450
00:50:39,044 --> 00:50:44,175
Something was upsetting you bad
last night when you called.

451
00:50:44,583 --> 00:50:46,813
And you wanted to tell me.

452
00:50:47,218 --> 00:50:50,745
So I figured that you
wanted me to help you.

453
00:50:51,990 --> 00:50:53,218
I did.

454
00:50:54,092 --> 00:50:57,323
Oh, I did.
But that was last night.

455
00:50:57,729 --> 00:51:01,495
Now I need your help. We have to
find Lula before it's too late.

456
00:51:02,200 --> 00:51:05,169
Honey, I have to ask you something.
- Okay.

457
00:51:06,871 --> 00:51:09,499
Is Santos
involved in this in any way?

458
00:51:12,911 --> 00:51:14,242
Hell no!

459
00:51:15,180 --> 00:51:18,809
Do you think I would do something
like that without coming to you?

460
00:51:20,518 --> 00:51:22,213
I'm sorry, honey.

461
00:51:24,222 --> 00:51:28,249
Goddamned Pucinski, son of a bitch!
- Who, Uncle Pooch?

462
00:51:28,660 --> 00:51:31,993
The son of a bitch who introduced
Santos to you and Clyde.

463
00:51:32,864 --> 00:51:34,195
Johnnie ...

464
00:51:35,400 --> 00:51:37,231
That's all the past.

465
00:51:38,103 --> 00:51:41,664
Now what you and I have to do ...

466
00:51:42,273 --> 00:51:45,003
is think about our future.

467
00:51:46,711 --> 00:51:47,905
Do you mean that?

468
00:51:49,914 --> 00:51:52,405
You bet your sweet ass I do!

469
00:51:53,818 --> 00:51:55,115
Gosh.

470
00:51:56,554 --> 00:51:59,250
Did I tell you
how great it was to see you again?

471
00:52:01,660 --> 00:52:03,491
Just about five times, that's all.

472
00:52:11,603 --> 00:52:14,800
Oh God, Johnnie, I love you!
- I love you too.

473
00:52:15,206 --> 00:52:20,269
Let's get our backsides
out of this town and go get my Lula!

474
00:52:47,605 --> 00:52:49,573
What's troublin' you, sugar?

475
00:52:53,344 --> 00:52:55,175
You know, Lula ...

476
00:52:55,580 --> 00:52:58,606
I never told you what all
I was doing before I met you.

477
00:52:59,017 --> 00:53:03,613
I just figured
you were out being Mr. Cool.

478
00:53:04,022 --> 00:53:05,853
Not exactly, sugar.

479
00:53:06,257 --> 00:53:12,253
One reason we're in this trouble
is because of what I was doing.

480
00:53:12,664 --> 00:53:14,996
I tried to tell you this before.

481
00:53:15,834 --> 00:53:17,995
You're scaring me, baby.

482
00:53:18,570 --> 00:53:21,835
Well, there's a good side
as well as a bad side to it.

483
00:53:22,841 --> 00:53:26,436
The good side is that I knew
your daddy. Clyde was a good guy.

484
00:53:26,845 --> 00:53:29,712
You knew my daddy?
- Yes.

485
00:53:30,715 --> 00:53:32,410
I sure did.

486
00:53:33,518 --> 00:53:35,008
The bad side of it ...

487
00:53:35,620 --> 00:53:38,384
is I did some driving
for a man named Marcello Santos.

488
00:53:38,790 --> 00:53:40,382
Oh Shit.

489
00:53:42,026 --> 00:53:43,220
I quit working for him,

490
00:53:43,628 --> 00:53:46,597
but just before I did,
I ended up one night at a house.

491
00:53:46,998 --> 00:53:48,727
I didn't know it then,

492
00:53:49,134 --> 00:53:51,125
but it was your house.

493
00:53:52,237 --> 00:53:55,001
I don't know
what they think I saw that night.

494
00:53:55,406 --> 00:53:58,705
I was just sitting out in the car,
'til the whole place went up in flames.

495
00:54:01,513 --> 00:54:05,711
Oh God, Sailor,
that's the night my daddy died!

496
00:54:07,018 --> 00:54:08,508
I know, sugar.

497
00:54:14,659 --> 00:54:15,819
Daddy?

498
00:54:19,931 --> 00:54:21,398
That's ...

499
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:26,336
some big secret
you've been carrying, Sail'.

500
00:54:27,372 --> 00:54:29,567
We all got
a secret side, baby.

501
00:54:30,575 --> 00:54:34,102
I hope you don't think
I been lyin' to you about other things.

502
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:04,467
Lula, you there?

503
00:55:05,977 --> 00:55:07,638
Yeah, I'm here ...

504
00:55:12,550 --> 00:55:13,778
You upset with me?

505
00:55:15,253 --> 00:55:18,017
It just shocking sometimes ...

506
00:55:19,390 --> 00:55:22,257
when things aren't
what you thought they were.

507
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:38,268
We're really
in the middle of it now, ain't we?

508
00:56:03,368 --> 00:56:07,771
I'm gonna pack real fast,
then I'll meet you downstairs.

509
00:56:08,172 --> 00:56:12,108
My God, what we could've done
on that kingsize bed tonight!

510
00:56:12,510 --> 00:56:16,139
Don't worry, I'll make up for it!
- Alright.

511
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:23,080
See you in a minute.
- Okay.

512
00:56:24,889 --> 00:56:26,288
Marietta ...

513
00:57:01,426 --> 00:57:03,053
What's that?

514
00:57:04,629 --> 00:57:07,291
I don't know ...
Looks like clothes.

515
00:57:28,219 --> 00:57:29,584
Oh God, Sailor!

516
00:57:29,988 --> 00:57:31,979
One bad car accident.

517
00:58:12,730 --> 00:58:13,788
What should we do?

518
00:58:14,198 --> 00:58:16,792
I don't know, but we got to
help that girl, get her to a town,

519
00:58:17,201 --> 00:58:20,568
and hope nobody finds out
that I broke parole.

520
00:58:23,674 --> 00:58:25,266
This bobby pin ...

521
00:58:27,779 --> 00:58:28,973
I can't find it.

522
00:58:29,380 --> 00:58:32,110
My mother's gonna kill me ...
... it's got all my cards ...

523
00:58:32,517 --> 00:58:33,711
It was in my pocket.

524
00:58:34,118 --> 00:58:37,281
Now my pocket's gone.
Gotta help me find it ...

525
00:58:38,489 --> 00:58:43,449
All my cards ...
and it was in my pocket, and ...

526
00:58:45,463 --> 00:58:51,424
My purse is gone!
Now she tells me!

527
00:58:51,836 --> 00:58:53,827
Let's get a hold of her!
- Is she going to make it?

528
00:58:54,238 --> 00:58:56,706
Don't know, but she's gonna
bleed all over our car!

529
00:58:57,108 --> 00:58:59,668
Hey ... hello! Girl!

530
00:59:00,678 --> 00:59:02,543
Come with us, honey!

531
00:59:02,947 --> 00:59:04,608
Leave me alone!

532
00:59:09,387 --> 00:59:11,412
Robert?

533
00:59:12,223 --> 00:59:13,815
Robert!

534
00:59:17,962 --> 00:59:19,088
Shit.

535
00:59:19,897 --> 00:59:22,991
Got this damned
sticky stuff in my hair ...

536
00:59:26,037 --> 00:59:28,369
... got sticky stuff in my hair.

537
00:59:28,806 --> 00:59:30,899
Better come with us, honey. Come on!

538
00:59:31,309 --> 00:59:34,710
Gotta find my wallet ...
Don't tell my mother, please.

539
00:59:35,113 --> 00:59:36,603
God, she's gonna kill me!

540
00:59:37,014 --> 00:59:39,005
Can't worry about that ...

541
00:59:40,818 --> 00:59:44,686
Where's my hairbrush?
- God, she's dying right in front of us.

542
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:55,159
Get my lipstick ...

543
00:59:57,168 --> 00:59:59,193
It's in my purse.

544
01:00:02,206 --> 01:00:04,401
She died
right in front of us, Sailor ...

545
01:00:04,842 --> 01:00:06,901
Why'd she have to go and do that?

546
01:00:09,780 --> 01:00:11,577
Let's get outta here, honey.

547
01:00:23,861 --> 01:00:25,761
Jesus, Mary and Joseph!

548
01:01:19,917 --> 01:01:22,784
I don't understand this one tiny bit.

549
01:01:23,187 --> 01:01:27,180
See, he told me to wait
for him here in that lobby there.

550
01:01:27,592 --> 01:01:32,928
What I feel is that something
terrible has happened to him.

551
01:01:34,599 --> 01:01:37,625
Perhaps we should
call a local law enforcement officer?

552
01:01:38,035 --> 01:01:39,900
No, please! Please no!

553
01:01:40,271 --> 01:01:44,173
The last thing I need
is some damned policeman

554
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:46,236
moving and going around here ...

555
01:01:46,644 --> 01:01:50,171
No, I just can't ...
no ... no.

556
01:01:52,149 --> 01:01:55,380
I am sorry ...
I must have overlooked this.

557
01:01:55,786 --> 01:01:58,414
I'm truly
sorry, ma'am.

558
01:02:11,402 --> 01:02:12,596
What?

559
01:02:15,640 --> 01:02:17,005
Could you ...?

560
01:02:20,244 --> 01:02:22,235
"Gone fishing with a friend ...

561
01:02:23,481 --> 01:02:26,917
and maybe buffalo hunting, too."

562
01:02:27,385 --> 01:02:28,750
Buffalo hunting?

563
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:31,181
"I've gone buffalo hunting."?

564
01:02:32,890 --> 01:02:36,519
What the fuck
does "Buffalo hunting" mean?

565
01:02:37,828 --> 01:02:39,659
Well, I am sure
I wouldn't know, I mean ...

566
01:02:40,064 --> 01:02:41,929
My God ...

567
01:02:42,933 --> 01:02:44,594
He's afraid.

568
01:02:46,871 --> 01:02:48,634
He's done it again!

569
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:50,439
The fucker split!

570
01:02:52,510 --> 01:02:55,035
"I've made a commitment."

571
01:02:55,713 --> 01:02:56,702
Marietta!

572
01:02:58,416 --> 01:02:59,678
Santos!

573
01:03:00,184 --> 01:03:03,620
Gentlemen, I'd like
to take this opportunity to ask you:

574
01:03:04,288 --> 01:03:07,621
Please, clear out!
- How rude!

575
01:03:08,693 --> 01:03:10,627
Me too?
- Yeah, you too.

576
01:03:22,873 --> 01:03:26,639
What did you do to Johnnie?
Where's Johnnie?

577
01:03:27,645 --> 01:03:28,839
What's happening here?

578
01:03:29,246 --> 01:03:33,182
Tell me what's happening here!
Santos, tell me!

579
01:03:33,584 --> 01:03:35,313
You been crying?

580
01:03:37,154 --> 01:03:40,089
You gotta cut out
this crybaby stuff, you know?

581
01:03:41,292 --> 01:03:44,022
You're my girl now, and Santos ...

582
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:46,291
Santos ...

583
01:03:48,599 --> 01:03:50,999
Santos wants to wipe away the tears,

584
01:03:52,737 --> 01:03:54,432
and make you happy.

585
01:03:56,807 --> 01:03:59,037
I want you to tell me ...

586
01:03:59,643 --> 01:04:01,702
I want you to tell me ...

587
01:04:02,113 --> 01:04:05,605
Did you do anything to Johnnie?
Did you hurt him? I want to know.

588
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:09,842
I did not do anything
to Johnnie Farragut.

589
01:04:10,855 --> 01:04:13,221
You swear, on your mother?

590
01:04:14,225 --> 01:04:19,253
I swear. On my mother.
- God! Oh God!

591
01:04:19,663 --> 01:04:21,187
Come on. We have to go.

592
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:23,692
I got word:

593
01:04:24,101 --> 01:04:25,591
The kids are moving through Texas.

594
01:04:26,003 --> 01:04:29,632
And I think a happy end
is being arranged there.

595
01:04:30,641 --> 01:04:33,041
That's it, give me a smile!

596
01:04:35,513 --> 01:04:37,037
Oh Santos.

597
01:04:39,583 --> 01:04:42,552
You're the only one

598
01:04:42,953 --> 01:04:45,387
that always came through for me.

599
01:04:58,169 --> 01:05:02,936
I smell your shit now, Johnnie.
Give us one more kiss, Reggie!

600
01:05:04,775 --> 01:05:06,265
Oh, fuck me!

601
01:05:08,779 --> 01:05:10,041
Fuck me!

602
01:05:10,948 --> 01:05:12,176
Fuck me!

603
01:05:31,435 --> 01:05:33,494
We hunt buffalo now.

604
01:05:33,904 --> 01:05:35,735
Can't wait no more!

605
01:05:44,148 --> 01:05:47,845
Remember the number ... ten!

606
01:05:49,053 --> 01:05:51,783
I can't stop her, Johnnie.

607
01:05:52,690 --> 01:05:57,821
But I gonna be standing behind you
with this big old gun!

608
01:06:00,631 --> 01:06:02,531
It's a Marine issue!

609
01:06:09,940 --> 01:06:11,407
I go out now ...

610
01:06:16,881 --> 01:06:18,212
Reggie!
- Yes?

611
01:06:19,383 --> 01:06:21,010
Show him now!

612
01:06:26,290 --> 01:06:27,848
Honey ...

613
01:06:29,460 --> 01:06:31,155
I forget to show you this!

614
01:06:32,029 --> 01:06:33,553
Santos?

615
01:06:34,932 --> 01:06:37,196
Oh God, Marietta, honey ...

616
01:06:59,256 --> 01:07:00,689
One ...

617
01:07:01,091 --> 01:07:03,491
Bye now!
- two ...

618
01:07:04,495 --> 01:07:06,622
three ... four ...

619
01:07:07,031 --> 01:07:09,158
Gettin' too hot now, Reggie!

620
01:07:09,567 --> 01:07:11,194
five ...

621
01:07:11,602 --> 01:07:12,796
... feeling myself ...

622
01:07:13,504 --> 01:07:14,471
six ...

623
01:07:15,940 --> 01:07:16,929
seven ...

624
01:07:17,341 --> 01:07:18,330
eight ...

625
01:07:18,943 --> 01:07:19,932
nine ...

626
01:07:21,111 --> 01:07:23,045
Fuck me now, Reggie!

627
01:07:23,747 --> 01:07:24,736
ten!

628
01:07:44,201 --> 01:07:46,999
Why in the hell d'you want
to come to Big Tuna, Sail'?

629
01:07:47,938 --> 01:07:50,236
I know
it's not exactly Emerald City ...

630
01:07:51,275 --> 01:07:52,867
Not as bad as the weather, ...

631
01:07:54,011 --> 01:07:57,105
'though it's a long way
off that road to California.

632
01:07:58,616 --> 01:08:01,608
Why in the hell d'you want
to come here, baby?

633
01:08:31,615 --> 01:08:33,207
Oh, look at this!

634
01:08:34,118 --> 01:08:38,054
What do you want, Mr. Snakeskin?

635
01:08:38,555 --> 01:08:41,046
I was hoping you could tell me
if there's a contract out on me.

636
01:08:41,525 --> 01:08:43,891
I really need to know.
- By who?

637
01:08:44,294 --> 01:08:46,819
Santos. Or Marietta Fortune.

638
01:08:48,098 --> 01:08:50,396
I heard you were going
with that bitch's daughter.

639
01:08:50,801 --> 01:08:55,738
You heard right.
- You are one big, stupid asshole.

640
01:08:57,975 --> 01:09:01,274
Don't you know that her mami and
Santos killed her daddy?

641
01:09:03,747 --> 01:09:07,183
So maybe one night
you got too close to a fire ...

642
01:09:07,584 --> 01:09:09,552
So maybe you're gonna burn.

643
01:09:11,221 --> 01:09:14,622
I didn't see nothin'.
- Sure. I did.

644
01:09:33,877 --> 01:09:35,174
Santos!

645
01:09:44,588 --> 01:09:46,146
Is there a contract?

646
01:09:46,557 --> 01:09:50,049
We had a deal once:
We'd tip each other off if we heard.

647
01:09:51,328 --> 01:09:54,991
I know. I remember.

648
01:09:55,566 --> 01:09:56,658
Well?

649
01:10:00,404 --> 01:10:02,372
I heard of nothing.

650
01:10:06,543 --> 01:10:07,908
Thanks.

651
01:10:46,016 --> 01:10:48,348
Sail', honey, is that you?

652
01:10:48,752 --> 01:10:50,219
The one and only!

653
01:10:51,488 --> 01:10:54,889
D'you get that oil, baby?
- Yes siree!

654
01:10:55,292 --> 01:10:57,317
I met a guy called Red.
He owns a garage.

655
01:11:03,801 --> 01:11:05,393
What's that smell?

656
01:11:06,737 --> 01:11:08,204
I barfed.

657
01:11:09,239 --> 01:11:14,040
I tried to make it to the bathroom,
but it was the wrong door.

658
01:11:15,045 --> 01:11:19,175
I think all this driving
is upsetting me, baby.

659
01:11:19,883 --> 01:11:22,044
D'you think we could stay here
and rest a couple of days?

660
01:11:22,452 --> 01:11:24,352
Are you
carsick, sweetheart?

661
01:11:26,557 --> 01:11:28,184
A little, I guess.

662
01:11:42,372 --> 01:11:43,999
Oh Sailor, honey:

663
01:11:45,909 --> 01:11:50,972
I hope seeing that girl die
didn't jinx us.

664
01:12:02,526 --> 01:12:04,391
I got this for you.

665
01:12:06,630 --> 01:12:08,689
It has 40 different flavors.

666
01:12:09,333 --> 01:12:11,893
One for about every reason
I love you.

667
01:12:14,004 --> 01:12:16,199
Sail', I'm gonna save this.

668
01:12:18,442 --> 01:12:20,467
But if I ever eat it,

669
01:12:20,878 --> 01:12:23,244
I'll be thinking of you.

670
01:12:41,431 --> 01:12:44,798
"Robert Brenton
and two passengers, William Reese

671
01:12:45,302 --> 01:12:51,002
and Julie Day, were killed
when his car crashed on Highway 118."

672
01:12:51,408 --> 01:12:53,603
Robert Brenton, that dumb fuck!

673
01:12:54,745 --> 01:12:58,237
That stupid shit was so dumb,
he deserved to die!

674
01:12:58,615 --> 01:13:00,276
That asshole!

675
01:13:03,353 --> 01:13:06,982
Timmy, what's going on in No. 4,
where them lights are always on?

676
01:13:11,261 --> 01:13:14,424
Them are making
a pornographic movie, Texas style!

677
01:13:15,032 --> 01:13:16,556
You wanna join in?

678
01:13:20,604 --> 01:13:25,200
To survive in Big Tuna, you
need an active sense of humor!

679
01:13:36,386 --> 01:13:41,153
This is Bosis Spool.
We call him "OO Spool".

680
01:13:41,558 --> 01:13:42,923
The man is a rocket scientist!

681
01:13:48,298 --> 01:13:52,598
My dog barks some.

682
01:14:00,944 --> 01:14:05,176
Mentally, you picture my dog,

683
01:14:06,416 --> 01:14:08,350
but, I have not told you

684
01:14:08,752 --> 01:14:12,813
the type of dog which I have.

685
01:14:15,659 --> 01:14:19,117
Perhaps
you might even picture Toto

686
01:14:19,529 --> 01:14:22,123
from the "Wizard of Oz".

687
01:14:27,237 --> 01:14:33,335
But I can tell you
my dog is always with me.

688
01:15:08,211 --> 01:15:09,769
Hey everybody!

689
01:15:10,781 --> 01:15:12,476
Bobby!
Hey, Sailor, Lula,

690
01:15:13,150 --> 01:15:16,847
This is the man himself!
Bobby, this is Sailor and Lula,

691
01:15:17,754 --> 01:15:19,381
the 2 most recent strandees,

692
01:15:19,856 --> 01:15:21,448
of the economic variety.

693
01:15:22,626 --> 01:15:25,720
Bobby Peru. Like the country.

694
01:15:26,329 --> 01:15:28,661
Bobby just rolled into town
a few days ago.

695
01:15:29,066 --> 01:15:31,261
Yeah, Bobby is
the most exciting item

696
01:15:31,668 --> 01:15:33,932
to hit Big Tuna
since the '86 cyclone

697
01:15:34,337 --> 01:15:36,328
sheared
the roof off the high school.

698
01:15:36,740 --> 01:15:40,471
You from Texas, Mr. Peru?

699
01:15:42,712 --> 01:15:44,680
I'm from all over.

700
01:15:47,951 --> 01:15:49,543
You were in the Marines.

701
01:15:54,091 --> 01:15:55,615
Four years.

702
01:15:56,293 --> 01:15:59,660
Bobby was at Cao Ben.
- What's Cao Ben?

703
01:16:01,498 --> 01:16:04,797
How old are you?
- Twenty.

704
01:16:11,942 --> 01:16:15,969
A lot of women and kids
and old people died at Cao Ben.

705
01:16:20,350 --> 01:16:21,817
You was on a ship, partner.

706
01:16:22,919 --> 01:16:25,149
Pretty hard to make contact
with the people,

707
01:16:25,555 --> 01:16:28,683
when you're out
floating in the Golf of Tonkin.

708
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:32,855
Come on Bobby,
have another glass of Jack.

709
01:16:37,901 --> 01:16:40,199
Don't mind
if I fuckin' do.

710
01:16:50,180 --> 01:16:51,841
Speakin' of Jack ...

711
01:16:54,518 --> 01:16:59,785
One-eyed Jack's yearning to go
peeping in a seafood store ...

712
01:17:05,829 --> 01:17:07,126
Alright.

713
01:17:10,100 --> 01:17:11,965
Nice meetin' you.

714
01:17:16,940 --> 01:17:19,238
Adios, boys!
- See ya, Bobby!

715
01:17:21,111 --> 01:17:22,942
Bobby's got a way ...

716
01:17:23,780 --> 01:17:26,214
Can't shake
that institution out of him.

717
01:17:29,653 --> 01:17:34,022
Baby, I still ain't feelin' so well.
I'm goin' to bed.

718
01:17:34,424 --> 01:17:37,222
Will you come with me?
- Yeah, I'll come along.

719
01:17:39,629 --> 01:17:40,857
Well ...

720
01:17:42,265 --> 01:17:44,665
Good night!
- Good night!

721
01:18:09,025 --> 01:18:11,289
Lordy, what was that about?

722
01:18:12,629 --> 01:18:14,221
I don't know ...

723
01:18:31,047 --> 01:18:33,811
Man, that barf smell
don't fade fast.

724
01:18:35,085 --> 01:18:36,450
Is there anything I can do for you?

725
01:18:38,154 --> 01:18:40,213
I don't think so, Sail'.

726
01:18:41,091 --> 01:18:43,321
I just need to lie down.

727
01:19:15,825 --> 01:19:17,315
You know what?

728
01:19:18,662 --> 01:19:20,721
I know you ain't
too pleased being here.

729
01:19:26,136 --> 01:19:27,603
It's not that.

730
01:19:35,412 --> 01:19:37,039
I'm gonna write it down,

731
01:19:38,648 --> 01:19:40,809
because I can't say it.

732
01:19:42,919 --> 01:19:44,580
You can't say it?

733
01:19:47,290 --> 01:19:50,020
I can't say this, not out loud.

734
01:19:59,769 --> 01:20:02,203
I'M PREGNANT.

735
01:20:08,845 --> 01:20:10,312
Oh God!

736
01:20:17,420 --> 01:20:19,251
It's okay by me, Peanut.

737
01:20:20,690 --> 01:20:24,319
Well, nothing personal ...

738
01:20:24,728 --> 01:20:26,958
But I ain't so sure
it's okay by me.

739
01:20:29,599 --> 01:20:32,898
Really, Sail',
it's nothing against you, baby.

740
01:20:33,903 --> 01:20:35,200
I love you.

741
01:20:37,340 --> 01:20:38,773
I love you too.

742
01:20:39,642 --> 01:20:41,041
I know.

743
01:20:44,881 --> 01:20:48,783
I'm just sort of uncomfortable
about how things are going,

744
01:20:50,186 --> 01:20:54,589
since we broke down
along that Yellow Brick Road,

745
01:20:54,991 --> 01:20:58,427
and this doesn't soothe me.

746
01:21:01,164 --> 01:21:04,190
Honey, I promise I ain't gonna let
things get no worse.

747
01:21:10,240 --> 01:21:12,208
Not in a million years.

748
01:21:49,012 --> 01:21:50,775
Hey, pretty woman. Is Sailor here?

749
01:21:51,181 --> 01:21:54,480
No, he's changing oil out in our car.
- I gotta take a piss, bad,

750
01:21:54,884 --> 01:21:57,045
can I use your head?

751
01:21:58,054 --> 01:21:59,214
Oh ... yeah, I guess.

752
01:22:00,023 --> 01:22:03,220
I don't mean your head head ...
I'm not goin' to piss on your hair,

753
01:22:03,626 --> 01:22:05,821
just gonna piss in the toilet.

754
01:22:06,563 --> 01:22:11,591
Ya'll take a listen, you'll hear
a deep sound comin' from Bobby Peru!

755
01:22:28,685 --> 01:22:31,813
There's a smell in this room of puke.

756
01:22:32,822 --> 01:22:34,687
Have you been puking?

757
01:22:37,527 --> 01:22:39,017
Are you sick?

758
01:22:40,363 --> 01:22:43,093
Pregnant?
- You used the toilet, now go!

759
01:22:43,500 --> 01:22:45,934
It ain't none of your business
what I do around here!

760
01:22:46,402 --> 01:22:49,496
I sure do like a woman
with nice tits like yours,

761
01:22:49,873 --> 01:22:53,900
who talks tough and looks like
she can fuck like a bunny.

762
01:22:54,310 --> 01:22:55,675
Can you fuck like that?

763
01:22:57,113 --> 01:22:59,445
You like it like a bunny?

764
01:23:00,583 --> 01:23:04,542
'Cause if you do, baby,
I'll fuck you good,

765
01:23:04,954 --> 01:23:08,412
like a big old jack-rabbit,
jump all around that hole!

766
01:23:09,425 --> 01:23:12,087
Bobby Peru don't come up for air!

767
01:23:13,630 --> 01:23:15,154
Get out!

768
01:23:16,099 --> 01:23:17,964
Am I scarin' you?

769
01:23:20,637 --> 01:23:22,195
Is your pussy wet?

770
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:25,798
Is it wet?

771
01:23:28,545 --> 01:23:30,376
Oh, don't jump back so slow.

772
01:23:30,780 --> 01:23:34,216
I thought you was a bunny!
Bunnies jump fast.

773
01:23:35,084 --> 01:23:37,177
You jump back slow.

774
01:23:38,321 --> 01:23:40,289
Means something, don't it?

775
01:23:41,791 --> 01:23:43,782
Means something to me.

776
01:23:44,794 --> 01:23:47,092
Means you want Bobby Peru.

777
01:23:47,730 --> 01:23:50,528
You want Bobby Peru
to fuck you hard, baby,

778
01:23:50,934 --> 01:23:53,198
to open you
like a Christmas present!

779
01:23:54,370 --> 01:23:59,706
You want me to do it?
Just a simple "yes" or "no".

780
01:24:00,109 --> 01:24:02,475
Just feel me breathin' on ya.

781
01:24:03,479 --> 01:24:08,007
And you know I mean business
when it comes to fuckin' ! - Out!

782
01:24:09,385 --> 01:24:12,183
Bobby Peru will grab ya ...

783
01:24:13,189 --> 01:24:14,986
hold ya tight ...

784
01:24:15,391 --> 01:24:17,222
feel everythin' in ya.

785
01:24:17,660 --> 01:24:19,218
Be quiet!

786
01:24:20,029 --> 01:24:21,428
Say "Fuck me".

787
01:24:22,231 --> 01:24:24,096
Then I'll leave.
- No way. Get out!

788
01:24:24,801 --> 01:24:28,635
Say it! I'll tear your
fuckin' heart out, girl!

789
01:24:29,639 --> 01:24:30,833
Say "Fuck me".

790
01:24:31,240 --> 01:24:32,832
Say "Fuck me"!

791
01:24:33,276 --> 01:24:36,109
Then I'll go. Say "Fuck me"!

792
01:24:36,512 --> 01:24:38,503
Whisper it. Say it!

793
01:24:39,582 --> 01:24:41,516
Say it. Say it!

794
01:24:42,919 --> 01:24:44,511
Say "Fuck me".

795
01:24:45,221 --> 01:24:47,212
Whisper it. "Fuck me".

796
01:24:48,391 --> 01:24:51,724
"Fuck me". Say "Fuck me".

797
01:25:28,865 --> 01:25:31,561
Some day honey, I will!
But I gotta get goin' !

798
01:25:35,905 --> 01:25:38,396
Sing! Don't cry ...

799
01:26:15,912 --> 01:26:17,345
Hi Bobby!

800
01:26:34,297 --> 01:26:37,266
You need a hand?
- Thanks, but I'm about done.

801
01:26:39,001 --> 01:26:40,366
How about a beer?

802
01:26:41,838 --> 01:26:43,396
A beer ...

803
01:26:44,774 --> 01:26:46,002
Well, ...

804
01:26:47,744 --> 01:26:49,336
Yeah, Bobby, that'd be fine.

805
01:26:52,648 --> 01:26:54,707
Where is your
pretty little lady today?

806
01:26:57,720 --> 01:27:01,679
She's up in our room, restin'.
Hasn't been feelin' well lately.

807
01:27:02,658 --> 01:27:04,626
Sorry to hear it.

808
01:27:46,769 --> 01:27:50,432
I've been studying
a situation over in Lobo.

809
01:27:50,840 --> 01:27:53,035
Take two men to handle it.

810
01:27:57,346 --> 01:27:59,143
What's that?

811
01:27:59,549 --> 01:28:02,916
A feed store,
keeps up to 5 K in their safe.

812
01:28:03,319 --> 01:28:06,379
Need me a good boy
for backup. Even split.

813
01:28:07,390 --> 01:28:09,051
Interested?

814
01:28:10,259 --> 01:28:11,920
No, man.

815
01:28:15,064 --> 01:28:16,622
I don't think so.

816
01:28:18,201 --> 01:28:20,135
It'll be easy, Sailor.

817
01:28:20,536 --> 01:28:26,566
Two employees. I take 'em in back
to open the safe. You cover the door.

818
01:28:33,349 --> 01:28:35,112
You ain't plannin' on raisin'

819
01:28:36,085 --> 01:28:38,781
a family in the Big Tuna, are you?

820
01:28:40,590 --> 01:28:42,956
Wait a minute ...

821
01:28:43,960 --> 01:28:45,825
Whad'ya mean by family?

822
01:28:46,829 --> 01:28:48,228
Well, I mean ...

823
01:28:48,831 --> 01:28:50,799
with Lula ...

824
01:28:53,369 --> 01:28:55,803
being in a family way and all.

825
01:28:58,274 --> 01:29:00,834
Did Lula tell you
she was pregnant?

826
01:29:01,510 --> 01:29:04,343
Couple of grand or two
sure would help you two out.

827
01:29:04,747 --> 01:29:10,014
Get you out West, to Mexico, or
anywhere with a few dollars to spare.

828
01:29:10,419 --> 01:29:12,614
I've got it figured out good.

829
01:29:13,756 --> 01:29:16,816
When did you talk to Lula?

830
01:29:19,328 --> 01:29:21,819
I talked to her
this afternoon,

831
01:29:25,134 --> 01:29:26,795
when you was out.

832
01:29:33,009 --> 01:29:36,809
Did she really say
she was pregnant?

833
01:29:39,282 --> 01:29:41,944
I just took a guess, that's all.

834
01:29:43,352 --> 01:29:45,411
You in or out on this deal?

835
01:29:49,158 --> 01:29:51,456
I ain't fucking sure, Bobby.

836
01:29:53,896 --> 01:29:56,126
Don't take too long to think about it.

837
01:30:08,010 --> 01:30:09,341
Had enough?

838
01:30:11,247 --> 01:30:12,737
Have now!

839
01:30:15,584 --> 01:30:18,144
Let's go outside.
I have something to show you.

840
01:30:21,357 --> 01:30:24,053
Right here
is a double-barreled, sawed-off

841
01:30:24,460 --> 01:30:26,018
Ithica shotgun.

842
01:30:27,430 --> 01:30:28,624
Next to it:

843
01:30:29,031 --> 01:30:34,594
a Smith & Wesson .38 handgun
with a 4-inch barrel.

844
01:30:44,513 --> 01:30:46,140
Those'll do her,

845
01:30:46,549 --> 01:30:48,813
really loosen up that 5 grand.

846
01:30:49,518 --> 01:30:52,146
Two and a half
for you and the little lady.

847
01:30:53,789 --> 01:30:56,223
How much money you got left?

848
01:30:58,060 --> 01:30:59,823
Forty bucks ...

849
01:31:00,329 --> 01:31:02,422
This is easy money, partner.

850
01:31:02,832 --> 01:31:05,164
Ain't nobody gonna get hurt.

851
01:31:06,168 --> 01:31:08,762
And I don't think
you can afford to pass it up ...

852
01:31:11,340 --> 01:31:15,333
I'll bring the Eldorado to
the back of the motel at 10 AM.

853
01:31:17,246 --> 01:31:20,374
Really could
set you and that little lady up good.

854
01:31:24,020 --> 01:31:25,612
Yeah, I guess so.

855
01:31:26,589 --> 01:31:28,216
That kinda money

856
01:31:29,191 --> 01:31:33,525
will get us a long way down
that Yellow Brick Road.

857
01:31:35,431 --> 01:31:39,060
But damn it, this better go real smooth,
you understand me?

858
01:31:39,468 --> 01:31:42,596
Like taking candy from a baby.

859
01:31:53,916 --> 01:31:55,406
Here comes Sailor.

860
01:32:27,650 --> 01:32:29,584
You've been drinkin', huh?

861
01:32:30,586 --> 01:32:32,247
A few beers is all.

862
01:32:34,590 --> 01:32:36,080
Feelin' any better?

863
01:32:36,759 --> 01:32:38,624
Can't tell yet.

864
01:32:45,101 --> 01:32:47,194
That smell's still filling this room good.

865
01:32:52,975 --> 01:32:54,943
So where d'you say you was?

866
01:32:59,281 --> 01:33:01,408
I went with Bobby.

867
01:33:07,857 --> 01:33:09,085
Sail'?

868
01:33:12,194 --> 01:33:13,491
Let's leave here.

869
01:33:14,130 --> 01:33:15,154
We are, Peanut.

870
01:33:19,401 --> 01:33:20,595
Real soon.

871
01:33:34,183 --> 01:33:37,209
You up to somethin' with Bobby Peru?

872
01:33:38,988 --> 01:33:40,979
What could I be up to?

873
01:33:52,768 --> 01:33:56,204
That Bobby Peru
is a black angel, Sail'.

874
01:33:58,040 --> 01:34:00,838
You hook up
with him and you'll regret it ...

875
01:34:01,610 --> 01:34:03,441
If you live to.

876
01:34:04,213 --> 01:34:05,874
Thanks, darling.

877
01:34:07,383 --> 01:34:10,216
I know
you got my interests in mind,

878
01:34:10,619 --> 01:34:12,849
and I appreciate it sincerely.

879
01:34:13,856 --> 01:34:16,381
I love you, but
I got to get some sleep now.

880
01:34:18,327 --> 01:34:23,355
This whole world is wild at heart ...
and weird on top.

881
01:34:32,408 --> 01:34:35,036
I wish you'd sing me
"Love me tender".

882
01:34:36,912 --> 01:34:40,279
Oh, I wish
I was somewhere over that rainbow.

883
01:34:41,917 --> 01:34:43,350
It's just shit!

884
01:34:44,720 --> 01:34:46,779
Shit, shit, shit!

885
01:35:29,365 --> 01:35:31,265
The whole gang, huh?

886
01:35:31,667 --> 01:35:32,656
Yes.

887
01:35:36,672 --> 01:35:39,971
You know, you look
a whole lot better in the flesh.

888
01:35:43,579 --> 01:35:45,945
The cobra
is waitin' to strike, Chica.

889
01:35:46,849 --> 01:35:48,646
You know that guy, Sailor?

890
01:35:49,051 --> 01:35:51,110
He came by the other afternoon.

891
01:35:51,620 --> 01:35:54,885
He wanted to know if there was
a contract on him. - No shit?

892
01:35:56,125 --> 01:35:58,457
You know him?
- I used to.

893
01:35:58,894 --> 01:36:01,556
What did you say?
- "No", of course.

894
01:36:02,131 --> 01:36:03,758
That's right.

895
01:36:05,401 --> 01:36:08,427
He could have
a bad accident, though.

896
01:36:12,675 --> 01:36:13,972
Before,

897
01:36:14,376 --> 01:36:16,401
during or after a hold-up.

898
01:36:27,523 --> 01:36:29,320
What am I doing here?

899
01:36:35,998 --> 01:36:38,364
Sailor, what are you doing here?

900
01:36:42,338 --> 01:36:43,828
I can't do this.

901
01:36:55,351 --> 01:36:56,545
Climb in back!

902
01:36:58,287 --> 01:36:59,845
What the hell's she doin' here?

903
01:37:00,255 --> 01:37:04,055
She's my girl.
She's drivin'. That bother you?

904
01:37:04,460 --> 01:37:05,586
Jump in!

905
01:37:05,994 --> 01:37:07,256
You owe me one.

906
01:37:07,663 --> 01:37:09,824
Come on, Mr. Big Round Balls,

907
01:37:11,166 --> 01:37:13,464
let's go
and make us some easy money.

908
01:37:19,475 --> 01:37:21,943
They say the eagle flies on Friday.

909
01:39:15,691 --> 01:39:17,591
Get that mask on!

910
01:39:18,494 --> 01:39:21,327
Keep it revvin', Chiquita.
We'll be right back!

911
01:39:21,797 --> 01:39:23,788
Nobody's gonna get hurt.
Remember that!

912
01:39:24,833 --> 01:39:26,357
Right, partner!

913
01:39:38,146 --> 01:39:39,670
Okay, boys!

914
01:39:40,082 --> 01:39:42,949
Get in the back!
Get into the back! Now! Both of you!

915
01:39:45,654 --> 01:39:48,452
If anyone comes in,
herd 'em back here quick.

916
01:39:48,857 --> 01:39:51,485
Alright,
let's make this nice and easy!

917
01:40:15,684 --> 01:40:17,652
You waitin' for somebody?

918
01:40:18,053 --> 01:40:19,520
My husband.

919
01:40:22,024 --> 01:40:24,686
He's in the feed store.

920
01:40:28,664 --> 01:40:32,623
Well, watch that cigarette, ma'am.
It's about to burn down to your fingers.

921
01:40:33,035 --> 01:40:35,333
Thank you, officer.

922
01:40:36,505 --> 01:40:39,440
I haven't seen you before.
Are you from Lobo?

923
01:40:40,409 --> 01:40:41,398
No.

924
01:40:42,177 --> 01:40:43,701
Over here!

925
01:40:45,247 --> 01:40:46,771
Big Tuna, huh?

926
01:40:47,182 --> 01:40:49,673
That's quite a drive, isn't it?
- Yes.

927
01:40:50,118 --> 01:40:51,312
Let's go!

928
01:40:52,087 --> 01:40:53,111
Say "Cheese".

929
01:40:55,924 --> 01:40:57,152
Stay put!

930
01:41:02,397 --> 01:41:03,864
Cool it, man!

931
01:41:06,301 --> 01:41:07,791
You're next, fucker!

932
01:41:19,381 --> 01:41:22,782
Those are dummies, dummy!

933
01:41:28,323 --> 01:41:30,689
Step up here, hotshot!

934
01:41:31,093 --> 01:41:33,459
I'll slap
that smile right off your face!

935
01:41:53,015 --> 01:41:54,642
Stop, you sons of bitches!

936
01:41:56,051 --> 01:41:58,042
This is the police!
Hold it or I'll shoot!

937
01:42:11,500 --> 01:42:12,728
Oh, for Christ's sakes!

938
01:42:15,604 --> 01:42:17,333
That poor bastard.

939
01:42:19,141 --> 01:42:20,768
Hands behind your head, cowboy!

940
01:42:23,645 --> 01:42:27,604
Lula, I really let you
down this time.

941
01:42:29,418 --> 01:42:30,715
Peanut!

942
01:42:31,386 --> 01:42:33,081
Look for the damned thing!

943
01:42:33,488 --> 01:42:38,255
We'll find it,
they sew them things back on.

944
01:42:38,660 --> 01:42:40,150
Works good as new.

945
01:42:40,562 --> 01:42:42,553
I can't find it.
Where is the damned thing?

946
01:42:42,964 --> 01:42:44,591
It's gotta be here somewhere.

947
01:43:11,193 --> 01:43:14,651
Pardon me. I'm lookin' for 770378.

948
01:43:27,776 --> 01:43:29,368
Sailor, baby!

949
01:43:58,173 --> 01:44:03,634
Oh my God! Oh my God!

950
01:44:04,045 --> 01:44:08,243
My baby, sweetest one. Oh, sweetheart.

951
01:44:08,650 --> 01:44:11,016
Mama's gonna take you home.
We're gonna go home.

952
01:44:11,419 --> 01:44:13,353
Santos is gonna help us.

953
01:44:13,755 --> 01:44:19,159
He's gonna take us
to the airport in San Antonio.

954
01:44:19,594 --> 01:44:22,256
It's OK, baby.
- No ... - Yes.

955
01:44:23,765 --> 01:44:25,460
Come!
We're gonna go.

956
01:44:25,867 --> 01:44:27,334
It's OK.
- Mama! - Yes?

957
01:44:27,736 --> 01:44:30,967
Sailor's in deep trouble here.
I can't just leave him.

958
01:44:31,373 --> 01:44:34,536
Oh yes, you can!

959
01:44:34,943 --> 01:44:37,571
Yes, you can!

960
01:44:42,284 --> 01:44:44,878
Your mama was
real worried about you, honey.

961
01:44:45,887 --> 01:44:47,445
Me too.

962
01:44:49,858 --> 01:44:52,326
Can you
give your old friend Santos a hug?

963
01:45:02,771 --> 01:45:04,534
Dearest Sailor,

964
01:45:05,173 --> 01:45:08,665
First thing you'll want to know is:
I'm keeping the baby.

965
01:45:09,044 --> 01:45:12,605
Mama wasn't for it at first,
but I think now she is.

966
01:45:13,014 --> 01:45:17,849
I'm gonna name it Pace,
no matter if it's a boy or a girl.

967
01:45:18,253 --> 01:45:23,281
It's kinda hard to believe that
Pace will be six when you get out.

968
01:45:23,692 --> 01:45:26,160
Our child!

969
01:45:26,561 --> 01:45:28,825
I love you, Sailor.

970
01:45:29,231 --> 01:45:31,665
I miss dancing
and talking,

971
01:45:32,067 --> 01:45:34,228
and especially the other!

972
01:45:39,074 --> 01:45:42,305
5 YEARS, 10 MONTHS, 21 DAYS LATER

973
01:45:43,245 --> 01:45:48,148
When ... does ... Sailor's train get in?

974
01:45:49,384 --> 01:45:50,715
Six.

975
01:45:55,991 --> 01:45:58,789
If I asked you
not to go ...

976
01:45:59,261 --> 01:46:01,354
It wouldn't make any difference.

977
01:46:02,564 --> 01:46:05,931
Girl, what if I told you
not to go?

978
01:46:06,735 --> 01:46:09,898
Mama, if you get in the way
of our happiness,

979
01:46:10,305 --> 01:46:12,535
I'll fucking pull your
arms out by the roots!

980
01:46:31,660 --> 01:46:33,560
No!

981
01:46:40,535 --> 01:46:43,129
Mama,
you almost crashed us!

982
01:46:45,106 --> 01:46:46,971
Oh, an accident, baby!

983
01:46:54,649 --> 01:46:56,617
Oh no, oh man!

984
01:46:59,120 --> 01:47:01,645
Same fuckin' thing
happened to me last year!

985
01:47:58,113 --> 01:47:59,774
You must be my son.

986
01:48:04,319 --> 01:48:06,514
Shake hands with your daddy, Pace.

987
01:48:11,259 --> 01:48:15,389
It's a pleasure to meet you, Pace.
I read a lot about you.

988
01:48:39,854 --> 01:48:41,617
Are you hungry?

989
01:48:43,758 --> 01:48:45,589
Lead the way.

990
01:48:46,594 --> 01:48:47,993
No!

991
01:48:49,297 --> 01:48:50,559
No!

992
01:49:12,520 --> 01:49:14,420
What's wrong, Mama?

993
01:49:14,823 --> 01:49:17,121
Don't worry, son. Just stay here.

994
01:49:29,938 --> 01:49:32,304
I'm sorry, Sailor,
I just can't help it.

995
01:49:32,740 --> 01:49:36,301
Just give me one little minute,
then I'll quit.

996
01:49:36,711 --> 01:49:40,010
The boy's frightened,
Lula. This ain't no good.

997
01:49:42,517 --> 01:49:44,781
Really, Sailor, I'll be okay.

998
01:49:51,392 --> 01:49:53,360
It's a mistake, honey.

999
01:49:53,761 --> 01:49:57,026
You two go on.
I'll walk back to the depot.

1000
01:49:58,299 --> 01:50:02,531
What are you talking about?
That's your son in there!

1001
01:50:02,937 --> 01:50:04,768
He never knew me, Lula.

1002
01:50:05,173 --> 01:50:06,970
So there's not
much for him to forget.

1003
01:50:07,375 --> 01:50:11,539
And 6 years apart
makes it almost simple for us too.

1004
01:50:13,248 --> 01:50:15,307
How can you say that, Sailor?

1005
01:50:17,185 --> 01:50:19,050
It's what makes sense.

1006
01:50:22,457 --> 01:50:24,391
Please don't do this, Sailor!

1007
01:50:26,861 --> 01:50:28,453
If ever something
doesn't feel right to you,

1008
01:50:28,863 --> 01:50:30,956
remember
what Pancho said to the Cisco Kid:

1009
01:50:31,933 --> 01:50:37,303
"Let's win, before we're dancing
at the end of a rope, without music."

1010
01:50:50,652 --> 01:50:53,120
You've been fine without me.

1011
01:50:53,521 --> 01:50:57,321
No need to make life
tougher than it has to be.

1012
01:51:18,479 --> 01:51:20,606
Sailor, come back!

1013
01:52:26,147 --> 01:52:27,614
What do you faggots want?

1014
01:53:07,655 --> 01:53:08,883
The Good Witch ...

1015
01:53:11,626 --> 01:53:13,184
Lula loves you.

1016
01:53:13,961 --> 01:53:17,556
But I'm a robber
and a manslaughterer.

1017
01:53:17,932 --> 01:53:20,264
And I haven't had
any parental guidance.

1018
01:53:20,668 --> 01:53:23,569
She's forgiven you all that.

1019
01:53:24,739 --> 01:53:28,106
You love her.

1020
01:53:28,509 --> 01:53:30,534
Don't be afraid, Sailor.

1021
01:53:31,612 --> 01:53:34,604
But I'm wild at heart.

1022
01:53:35,049 --> 01:53:37,643
If you are truly wild at heart,

1023
01:53:38,653 --> 01:53:40,951
you'll fight for your dreams.

1024
01:53:44,959 --> 01:53:47,757
Don't turn away from love, Sailor.

1025
01:53:49,564 --> 01:53:51,896
Don't turn away from love.

1026
01:54:18,526 --> 01:54:19,925
Had enough, asshole?

1027
01:54:22,597 --> 01:54:24,258
Yes I have.

1028
01:54:24,832 --> 01:54:26,925
And I want to
apologize to you gentlemen

1029
01:54:27,335 --> 01:54:29,565
for referring to you as homosexuals.

1030
01:54:29,971 --> 01:54:32,462
I also want to thank you fellows.

1031
01:54:32,874 --> 01:54:35,934
You've taught me
a valuable lesson in life.

1032
01:56:02,697 --> 01:56:04,892
I just met
the Good Witch.
