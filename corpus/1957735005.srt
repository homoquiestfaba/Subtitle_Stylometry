a shot at the title?

563
00:28:26,371 --> 00:28:27,765
- Because it's the right thing
to do.

564
00:28:27,789 --> 00:28:30,000
Sonny is a very talented,
gifted fighter.

565
00:28:30,125 --> 00:28:31,477
He's the number one contender
in the world,

you stand a chance?

00:28:36,673 --> 00:28:38,818

didn't stand a chance, bill.

570
00:28:38,842 --> 00:28:40,737

of the negro race on you

to win this fight?

572
00:28:41,887 --> 00:28:43,013
- They're both Negroes,

573
00:28:43,138 --> 00:28:44,657
and I'm sure no matter
what the outcome is,

574

their race with dignity.

703

were very interested

the flight out to St. Louis

706
00:34:04,751 --> 00:34:05,877
before we did.

707
00:34:06,002 --> 00:34:07,855
- That's something else
I stole from him, right?

709
00:34:09,130 --> 00:34:11,049
I'll give you another chance
to win her back.

talk business in the back,

00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:50,490
that these dumb fucks
couldn't see

728
00:34:50,589 --> 00:34:52,048
even if they had
a magnifying glass?

729
00:34:52,173 --> 00:34:54,509
That's what you call
"our thing"?

730
00:34:57,554 --> 00:34:59,264
Cat got your tongue,
you ungrateful bitch?

731
00:34:59,389 --> 00:35:01,933
- This conversation is over.

732
00:35:04,060 --> 00:35:05,520
- Fifth and main.

733
00:35:05,645 --> 00:35:07,623
Fifth and main is where
I found you giving blow jobs

734
00:35:07,647 --> 00:35:09,524
for ten bucks a pop.

735
00:35:09,649 --> 00:35:12,027
But you know what
I just figured out?

736
00:35:12,152 --> 00:35:13,528
You're still a hooker.

737
00:35:13,653 --> 00:35:16,656
You just charge more
for your blowjobs.

738
00:35:17,824 --> 00:35:21,870
- I said,
this conversation's over.

739
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:25,290
- So I'm out, huh?

740
00:35:29,002 --> 00:35:31,588
- Nah, she's yours for now,

741
00:35:31,713 --> 00:35:33,840
until something better
comes along.

742
00:35:33,965 --> 00:35:35,634
- So you admit I'm better,
huh, Bobby?

743
00:35:35,759 --> 00:35:36,968
- Hey, Caesar.

744
00:35:37,093 --> 00:35:38,511
When you gave her
that last kiss,

745
00:35:38,637 --> 00:35:39,888
I was just wondering,

746
00:35:40,013 --> 00:35:43,141
how does my dick taste?

747
00:35:49,939 --> 00:35:51,650
- Son of a bitch!

748
00:35:51,775 --> 00:35:52,776
-Hew no, no!

749
00:35:52,901 --> 00:35:53,902
You two stop!

750
00:35:54,027 --> 00:35:55,945
I'll bust y'all right up!

751
00:35:56,988 --> 00:35:58,156
- You're fucking dead.

752
00:35:58,281 --> 00:35:59,366
You hear me?

753
00:35:59,491 --> 00:36:01,451
- Fricking jerk-off.

754
00:36:01,576 --> 00:36:03,256
There's gonna be all kinds
of ramifications

755
00:36:03,328 --> 00:36:04,329
'cause of this asshole.

756
00:36:04,454 --> 00:36:05,890
You got a fight
to worry about, Sonny.

757
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:07,224
Come on.
You got to get out of here.

758
00:36:07,248 --> 00:36:08,708
- You sure?
- I'm sure.

759
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:11,044
All right, honey.

760
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,380
Let's go.

761
00:36:15,757 --> 00:36:17,592
- What, are you fucking stupid
or something?

762
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:19,719
- No.

763
00:36:23,682 --> 00:36:25,684
- What do you think
we said to his request?

764
00:36:25,809 --> 00:36:27,852
- What request?

765
00:36:27,977 --> 00:36:30,105
- To have you whacked.

766
00:36:30,230 --> 00:36:32,857
- You said no.

767
00:36:35,151 --> 00:36:36,695
- What makes you think that?

768
00:36:36,820 --> 00:36:38,571
- Because you're
pissed off at me.

769
00:36:38,697 --> 00:36:40,297
Usually, when you want
to whack somebody,

770
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:41,884
you're like,
"hey, Caesar, how you doing?

771
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:42,909
"Caesar, you hungry?

772

down the street.

we're going to get laid
tonight."

778
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:52,043
Come on.

779
00:36:52,168 --> 00:36:53,253
- This time, you're right.

780
00:36:53,378 --> 00:36:55,422
But if you're gonna give
a guy a beating,

781
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,923
it's nobody's business.

782
00:36:57,048 --> 00:36:59,092
But you don't hit him
over the head with a bottle.

783
00:37:00,969 --> 00:37:02,822
Now, you're going to have
to give him ten grand.

784
00:37:02,846 --> 00:37:04,889
- Ten grand? Are you kidding me?

785
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:06,015
All right, I mean...

786
00:37:06,141 --> 00:37:07,517
- It's his request.

787
00:37:07,642 --> 00:37:08,882
That's what you're going to do.

788
00:37:08,935 --> 00:37:10,437
- All right,
I'll give it to him.

789
00:37:10,562 --> 00:37:12,814
But I don't have it on hand.
I mean...

790
00:37:24,325 --> 00:37:27,370
- Don't make an asshole
out of me.

00:37:28,580 --> 00:37:29,706
I don't need a war.

- Capisce.

794
00:37:32,125 --> 00:37:33,460
- Nico will be over later

795
00:37:33,585 --> 00:37:35,962
to talk about Sonny.

796

- I'm not staying.
- Okay.

to the house.

813

- Caesar. What are you doing?

814

so I could bet half.

- Wow, you know,
good choice, Nico,

827
00:39:04,843 --> 00:39:08,596
because Sonny's gonna tear
this guy apart.

There's no way Sonny's
gonna lose against this guy.

to take a dive.

They're going to score
some shit.

1276
01:02:14,064 --> 01:02:17,567
Who are these bitches?

1277
01:02:22,239 --> 01:02:24,783
Who is this guy?

1278
01:02:33,250 --> 01:02:35,043
- Why are we sitting here?

1279
01:02:35,168 --> 01:02:37,087
- Bobby Zazo.

1280
01:02:37,212 --> 01:02:39,214
- What about him?

1281
01:02:39,339 --> 01:02:41,132
- He's been telling people
around town

1282
01:02:41,258 --> 01:02:44,886
the fights are fixed.

1283
01:02:45,011 --> 01:02:46,429
- Why would he do that?

1284
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:48,098
- Fuck do I know?

1285
01:02:48,223 --> 01:02:51,351
It's just bad for business.

1286
01:02:52,727 --> 01:02:55,981
Farah's been acting strange.

1287
01:02:56,106 --> 01:02:58,483
I think he's fucking her again.

1288
01:02:58,608 --> 01:03:00,026
Something isn't right.

1289
01:03:00,151 --> 01:03:03,071
All I know is,
the family had a meeting,

1290
01:03:03,196 --> 01:03:04,698
and a decision was made.

1291
01:03:04,823 --> 01:03:07,909
- Look... whoaw. Whoaw.

1292
01:03:08,034 --> 01:03:09,160
A decision was made?

1293
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:10,704
- Yeah.

1294
01:03:10,829 --> 01:03:11,949
- Well, what we about to do?

1295
01:03:11,997 --> 01:03:13,081
- Oh, calm down.

1296
01:03:13,206 --> 01:03:15,458
- If I kill somebody,
it got to be for my own reason.

1297
01:03:15,583 --> 01:03:16,943
- I don't want you
to kill anybody.

1298
01:03:17,002 --> 01:03:19,754
Just put a fucking scare
into him.

1299
01:03:19,879 --> 01:03:21,006
He's got a big mouth.

1300
01:03:21,131 --> 01:03:22,299
- What you need me for?

1301
01:03:22,424 --> 01:03:24,509
- Well, who's scarier than you,
Sonny?

1302
01:03:32,142 --> 01:03:33,268
That him?

1303
01:03:34,644 --> 01:03:35,687
Here we go. Come on.

1304
01:03:35,812 --> 01:03:37,814
Let's go.

1305
01:03:42,527 --> 01:03:44,529
Hey, douche bag!

1306
01:03:45,822 --> 01:03:47,699
- What the fuck do you want?

1307
01:03:50,452 --> 01:03:51,953
- Let's take a ride.

1308
01:03:52,078 --> 01:03:53,806
- I ain't got time
to go back and forth with you

1309
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:55,040
over some dame.

1310
01:03:55,165 --> 01:03:56,809
- This ain't about a dame
this time, Bobby.

1311
01:03:56,833 --> 01:03:58,043
You got a big fucking mouth,

1312
01:03:58,168 --> 01:04:00,253
and I told you,
it was only a matter of time

1313
01:04:00,378 --> 01:04:01,480
before it caught up with you.

1314
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:03,006
- Fuck you.
- I ain't going nowhere.

1315
01:04:03,131 --> 01:04:04,799
- You hear that? Fuck me?

1316
01:04:04,924 --> 01:04:06,360
You hear the way
he talks to me, Sonny,

1317
01:04:06,384 --> 01:04:07,427
this piece of shit?

1318
01:04:07,552 --> 01:04:09,220
- Do you mean to tell me
you cocksuckers

1319
01:04:09,346 --> 01:04:11,014
got the heavyweight champion
in the world

1320
01:04:11,139 --> 01:04:13,224
out here doing muscle work?

1321
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:16,728
What a fucking lack of respect
for that man.

1322
01:04:16,853 --> 01:04:18,146
I don't know, champ.

1323
01:04:18,271 --> 01:04:20,690
Maybe getting with these guys
wasn't such a good idea.

1324
01:04:20,815 --> 01:04:22,984
My family would have never
done this to you.

1325
01:04:23,109 --> 01:04:25,487
The truth is,
I've been saying some things

1326
01:04:25,612 --> 01:04:27,155
I shouldn't have been saying,

1327
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:30,283
but we all get a bit drunker
than we should sometimes,

1328
01:04:30,408 --> 01:04:32,911
but for them to send me
this fucking prick?

1329
01:04:33,036 --> 01:04:34,412
A slap in the face
is what that is.

1330
01:04:34,537 --> 01:04:36,373
- I got your prick right here.

1331
01:04:36,498 --> 01:04:38,416
It was nice seeing you
for the last time,

1332
01:04:38,541 --> 01:04:39,751
you big-headed fucking moose.

1333
01:04:39,876 --> 01:04:42,170
- Fuck you!
- Yeah!

1334
01:04:42,295 --> 01:04:44,422
- Cocksucking motherfucker.

1335
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:45,840
- I heard it was about that big.

1336
01:04:45,965 --> 01:04:47,175
- Caesar, you something else.

1337
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:49,302
- Come on, Sonny.

1338
01:04:54,057 --> 01:04:55,433
- No, no, no, no.

1339
01:04:55,558 --> 01:04:57,018
Come on, stop now. Stop.

1340
01:04:57,143 --> 01:04:58,186
Come on now. Stop.

1341
01:04:58,311 --> 01:05:00,855
Stop.

1342
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:06,069
- Feed me a fry.

1343
01:05:06,194 --> 01:05:08,071
- [Chuckles]

1344
01:05:08,196 --> 01:05:12,242
Hey, baby, I don't know
what you think this is,

1345
01:05:12,367 --> 01:05:15,036
but I ain't the type of man
that's gonna be feeding you.

1346
01:05:15,161 --> 01:05:17,789
I ain't bringing you roses

1347
01:05:17,914 --> 01:05:19,833
or hugging you
under the full moon.

1348
01:05:19,958 --> 01:05:21,751
So why don't you just sit
on that bed,

1349
01:05:21,876 --> 01:05:23,420
watch some TV or something,

1350
01:05:23,545 --> 01:05:25,463
let me finish my sandwich?

1351
01:05:25,588 --> 01:05:28,216
Then we're going to do
what we came here to do.

1352
01:05:28,341 --> 01:05:29,843
That's all.

1353
01:05:29,968 --> 01:05:30,969
- You think I'm just here

1354
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:35,432
because I want
some big black stud?

1355
01:05:35,557 --> 01:05:37,475
- [Chuckles]

1356
01:05:37,600 --> 01:05:39,060
Girl...

1357
01:05:39,185 --> 01:05:40,395
- Is that why you're here?

1358
01:05:40,520 --> 01:05:41,813
Is that is? What?

1359
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,457
To take out on me
everything the white man

1360
01:05:43,481 --> 01:05:44,482
has ever done to you?

1361
01:05:44,607 --> 01:05:45,650
- Oh, yeah, the white man.

1362
01:05:45,775 --> 01:05:48,653
- Yeah, everything the reporters
say about you.

1363
01:05:48,778 --> 01:05:50,071
Is that it?

1364
01:05:50,196 --> 01:05:52,174
Because it's not because
you're not the type of man

1365
01:05:52,198 --> 01:05:53,908
that does those sweet things.

1366
01:05:54,033 --> 01:05:56,828
You just don't want to do them
with me.

1367
01:05:56,953 --> 01:05:58,496
Geraldine...

1368
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:00,641
- I told you to keep my wife's
name out your mouth, didn't I?

1369
01:06:00,665 --> 01:06:01,934
- Okay—
- didn't I tell you that?

1370
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:03,001
- Okay, great, Sonny. Why?

1371
01:06:03,126 --> 01:06:04,461
Now are you going to hit me?

1372
01:06:04,586 --> 01:06:06,730
Because that'll really be
sticking it to the white folk,

1373
01:06:06,754 --> 01:06:10,300
if you hit me and fuck me.

1374
01:06:10,425 --> 01:06:12,844
Wait.

1375
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:14,012
Wait.

1376
01:06:14,137 --> 01:06:16,264
No, no.

1377
01:06:16,389 --> 01:06:17,682
No, I’m...

1378
01:06:17,807 --> 01:06:18,933
I'm sorry.

1379
01:06:19,058 --> 01:06:20,393
- You better get out of my way.

1380
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:21,561
- I didn't mean it, Sonny.

1381
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:23,313
- I'm out of here.

1382
01:06:25,064 --> 01:06:26,191
- Please.

1383
01:06:26,316 --> 01:06:30,111
I get to see you once a week.

1384
01:06:30,236 --> 01:06:32,489
- Oh, that's it, huh?

1385
01:06:34,324 --> 01:06:37,994
You're going to miss
your once-a-week fuck, huh?

1386
01:06:38,119 --> 01:06:39,537
- No, that's not it.

1387
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:40,872
That's not what I meant.

1388
01:06:40,997 --> 01:06:43,875
- That's all I'm good for, huh?

1389
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:45,043
- Sonny.

1390
01:06:45,168 --> 01:06:46,836
- Your once-a-week fuck?

1391
01:06:46,961 --> 01:06:48,671
- Sonny, come on.

1392
01:06:48,796 --> 01:06:49,964
- Hmm?
- Sonny...

1393
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:52,091
- Ah!

1394
01:06:54,636 --> 01:06:58,389
- Sonny. Ah!

1395
01:06:58,515 --> 01:07:01,059
- That's all I'm good for?

1396
01:07:01,184 --> 01:07:03,937
Go ahead and look me in the eye

1397
01:07:04,062 --> 01:07:08,566
and say I'm just good
for your once-a-week fuck.

1398
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,235
- What I meant...

1399
01:07:10,360 --> 01:07:14,072
- What did you mean?

1400
01:07:14,197 --> 01:07:15,490
What did you mean?

1401
01:07:15,615 --> 01:07:16,616
- Don't be like this.

1402
01:07:16,741 --> 01:07:18,243
- No, you tell me.

1403
01:07:18,368 --> 01:07:22,247
Tell me.
What the fuck did you mean?

1404
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:23,873
- Huh?
- Sonny.

1405
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:24,999
Come on.

1406
01:07:25,124 --> 01:07:29,128

World heavyweight boxing title
on the line.

Brought to you by

1420
01:08:28,646 --> 01:08:30,273
- All right, Sonny, cassias,

1421
01:08:30,398 --> 01:08:31,774
you both know the rules,

1422
01:08:31,899 --> 01:08:33,234
so let's have
a good, clean fight.

1423
01:08:33,359 --> 01:08:35,320
Protect yourself at all times.

Okay.

Let's do it.

01:08:42,619 --> 01:08:45,288
- Sonny is feeling out
cassias Clay.

1430
01:08:45,413 --> 01:08:48,750
Clay is dancing and taunting
the powerful Liston,

1431
01:08:48,875 --> 01:08:52,545
pawing at him
with that strong left jab.

1432
01:08:52,670 --> 01:08:56,257
But this youngster
has his own style,

1433
01:08:56,382 --> 01:08:58,885
and it's confusing
for the champion to fathom

1434
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:00,637
this early in the fight,

1435
01:09:00,762 --> 01:09:03,264
at least up to now.

1436
01:09:03,389 --> 01:09:07,101
Sonny Liston may have
his hands full tonight.

01:09:23,284 --> 01:09:24,702
with both hands high,

1442
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:28,373
mocking the champion.

1443
01:09:34,504 --> 01:09:36,881
In close range,
if you look closely...

1444
01:09:37,006 --> 01:09:39,384
Although Barney Felix does
want them apart at this point,

1445
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:40,789
because their hands were tied...

1446
01:09:40,843 --> 01:09:44,097
Sonny will be the guy
that will keep mauling away.

1447
01:09:45,723 --> 01:09:48,810
I'd like to point out
that the champion is strong,

1448
01:09:48,935 --> 01:09:52,563
durable, takes the good shot.

1449
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:55,900
However, he is being
out-maneuvered at most points,

1450
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:58,695
because this fellow has
that awkwardly fast style

1451
01:09:58,820 --> 01:10:00,571
of going side to side,

1452
01:10:00,697 --> 01:10:03,116
moving the upper part
of his body.

1453
01:10:06,327 --> 01:10:08,454
Ding!

1454
01:10:09,956 --> 01:10:10,957
- Sonny, you got this.

1455
01:10:11,082 --> 01:10:12,834
- Do it.

1456
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:14,269
- What are you talking about,
man?

1457
01:10:14,293 --> 01:10:16,254
- Do it.

1458
01:10:18,297 --> 01:10:19,298
Ding!

1459
01:10:19,424 --> 01:10:20,425
- Time.

1460
01:10:20,550 --> 01:10:22,051
Let's go.

1461
01:10:22,176 --> 01:10:25,263
- Come on, Sonny! Come on!

1462
01:10:30,268 --> 01:10:31,853
- It looks like his eyes...

1463
01:10:31,978 --> 01:10:33,479
His eyes are bothering him.

1464
01:10:33,604 --> 01:10:37,442
Ladies and gentlemen,
something got in his right eye.

1465
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,694
However he's blinking badly.

1466
01:10:39,819 --> 01:10:42,488
Sonny's gonna try
to take advantage of this,

1467
01:10:42,613 --> 01:10:45,450
but there's not enough time.

1468
01:10:45,575 --> 01:10:48,703
End of round.

1469
01:10:56,085 --> 01:10:57,754
- Come on, now.

1470
01:11:02,675 --> 01:11:05,303
- Big right hand to the body.

1471
01:11:05,428 --> 01:11:07,972
Clay, with a variety of punches...

1472
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:09,307
Startling combinations.

1473
01:11:09,432 --> 01:11:13,269
Putting punches together,
that's his strong point.

1474
01:11:16,647 --> 01:11:18,065
Ladies and gentlemen,

1475
01:11:18,191 --> 01:11:21,194
what do you think is going on
in Liston's mind right now?

1476
01:11:21,319 --> 01:11:22,653
I'll tell you what
he's thinking.

1477
01:11:22,779 --> 01:11:24,989
He's thinking he's
underestimated this challenger.

1478
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:26,532
He's quicker than he thought,

1479
01:11:26,657 --> 01:11:29,535
and more resilient
than he first believed.

1480
01:11:29,660 --> 01:11:31,537
There goes another one.

1481
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:32,830
Sonny wobbles.

1482
01:11:32,955 --> 01:11:34,081
Sonny wobbles.

1483
01:11:34,207 --> 01:11:36,334
Cassius has him hurt.

1484
01:11:38,586 --> 01:11:40,671
Sonny is in trouble.

1485
01:11:40,797 --> 01:11:41,839
He's in trouble.

1486
01:11:41,964 --> 01:11:44,050
Clay is punishing him.

1487
01:11:44,175 --> 01:11:47,386
This young fighter
is showing a lot of heart.

1488
01:11:49,764 --> 01:11:51,182
- Look, we still got this, man.

1489
01:11:51,307 --> 01:11:53,976
You can't stand there.
You got to move, man.

1490
01:11:55,603 --> 01:11:56,646
You got to move.

1491
01:11:56,771 --> 01:12:00,608
Come on, man.

1492
01:12:00,733 --> 01:12:05,029
When you bring your head down,
you bring it to him.

1493
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,031
You cannot stay in one place.

1494
01:12:07,156 --> 01:12:08,950
- Oh, shut up!

1495
01:12:09,075 --> 01:12:10,076
- Sonny...

1496
01:12:10,201 --> 01:12:12,537
- Shut up!

1497
01:12:15,164 --> 01:12:16,624
It's over.

1498
01:12:16,749 --> 01:12:17,909
- What are you talking about?

1499
01:12:18,000 --> 01:12:20,294
- That's it.

1500
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:21,420
Tell 'em my shoulder.

1501
01:12:21,546 --> 01:12:22,922
- What's the matter?

1502
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:24,048
- His shoulder.
- What?

1503
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:25,174
- Right shoulder.

1504
01:12:25,299 --> 01:12:26,300
His shoulder, man.

1505
01:12:26,425 --> 01:12:28,094
- That's it. The fight's over.

1506
01:12:28,219 --> 01:12:29,887
- They might be stopping it.

1507
01:12:30,012 --> 01:12:31,556
That might be all.

1508
01:12:31,681 --> 01:12:32,723
Ladies and gentlemen,

1509
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:34,892
it appears they're stopping
the fight.

1510
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:36,519
They are stopping the fight.

1511
01:12:36,644 --> 01:12:40,314
Something about
Liston's shoulder.

1512
01:12:40,439 --> 01:12:41,774
Liston's shoulder went out.

1513
01:12:41,899 --> 01:12:43,234
He could not continue.

1514
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:46,445
Winner by a TKO
in the seventh round:

1515
01:12:46,571 --> 01:12:49,365
Cassias Clay.

1516
01:12:53,327 --> 01:12:55,830
Cassius Clay celebrates
his victory,

1517
01:12:55,955 --> 01:12:57,999
goes into the record book

1518
01:12:58,124 --> 01:12:59,750
with corbett, Tunney,
and Braddock

1519
01:12:59,876 --> 01:13:02,920
as another who brought off
one of the great upsets

1520
01:13:03,045 --> 01:13:06,007
in heavyweight history.

1521
01:13:09,093 --> 01:13:10,595
- Why did you do it?

1522
01:13:10,720 --> 01:13:11,888
- "I am the greatest."

1523
01:13:12,013 --> 01:13:14,682
- Huh?

1524
01:13:14,807 --> 01:13:17,059
It's just us in here, Sonny.

1525
01:13:17,184 --> 01:13:19,562
Why did you do it, man?

1526
01:13:31,949 --> 01:13:34,785
- Because I'm ignorant.

1527
01:13:56,933 --> 01:13:59,894
That's what you want to do, huh?

1528
01:14:00,019 --> 01:14:01,854
You will my nature rise.

- Leave.

1534
01:14:53,489 --> 01:14:55,199
- Gerry,

put away the gun
before somebody get hurt.

- Before somebody get hurt?

1537

It's too late.

1538
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:06,627
Somebody already got hurt.

1539
01:15:06,752 --> 01:15:09,213
- She don't mean nothing to me.

1540
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:12,550
- Well, you sure
mean something to her,

1541
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:14,176
'cause she was ready
to stand here

1542
01:15:14,301 --> 01:15:15,720
and take a bullet with you.

1543
01:15:15,845 --> 01:15:20,391
Sonny, you know you famous now.

and not be spotted.

1547

Now, the papers don't know
who that white woman is,

1548

but they know who you are,

1549
01:15:33,696 --> 01:15:34,780
and if you could read,

1550
01:15:34,905 --> 01:15:37,742
you'd probably know this.

1551

- You think I give a shit
about what you done told me?

Do you love her?

of showing it.

that it's over,

going to see her again.

Um, you know what else?

But then when it didn't turn out
the way they wanted,

to nigger-ville.

to them.

When they can't find goodness
in themselves,

I don't know how
they're gonna find it in you.

Halfway through

to the head now...

1668

Mostly toward that body.

1669

You know the old story:

1670

- The question is,
did he even hit him?

for my eyes to see.

This kind of thing is what
gives boxing a black eye,

1700
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:18,845
but tonight Sonny Liston
went one step further.

1701
01:24:18,971 --> 01:24:21,890
He kicked dirt in the face
of the sport.

1702
01:24:22,015 --> 01:24:23,767
At one time,
a little over a year ago,

1703

he was considered unbeatable,
unstoppable.
