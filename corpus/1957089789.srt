saying that it hasn't been

00:03:43,391 --> 00:03:46,927
I thought the company
paid for stuff like that?

60
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:48,061
We lost the account.

61
00:03:50,498 --> 00:03:51,599

Did he?

87
00:04:58,065 --> 00:04:59,700
He said he hadn't
heard from you in awhile

88
00:04:59,733 --> 00:05:01,602

your flight got in.

I'll get up with him

paperwork in there

96
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:21,555
that still needs your signature.

97
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:22,956
I think it came
in from the lawyer

98
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,825
but I think you should
still look at them.

99
00:05:24,858 --> 00:05:26,560

fashioned, I guess,

See, we're all
flawed when it comes

113
00:06:11,071 --> 00:06:15,075
to expressing what we feel

114
00:06:15,108 --> 00:06:18,345
in a way that our significant
other will understand.

115
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,283
[Dr. Connors] Does the
fault land with the person

116
00:06:23,316 --> 00:06:26,554
receiving or giving
the information?

117
00:06:28,689 --> 00:06:31,525
Well, that's the million
dollar question, doc.

118
00:06:31,559 --> 00:06:33,393

of money to find out.

How 'bout when I get back

149
00:10:18,451 --> 00:10:21,621

I'm going up there
tomorrow to make sure

375
00:21:37,263 --> 00:21:38,831
they put that new flooring in.

376
00:21:38,865 --> 00:21:41,067
I can by there
if you need me to.

377
00:21:41,100 --> 00:21:42,001
Nah, nah.

378
00:21:42,034 --> 00:21:43,370
I'll do it.

379
00:21:43,403 --> 00:21:44,937
I just came to let you know.

380
00:21:44,971 --> 00:21:46,739
Once it's finished we can
get some renters up there.

381
00:21:46,773 --> 00:21:48,007
Yeah man, I hear that.

382
00:21:48,040 --> 00:21:49,376
All right.

383
00:21:49,409 --> 00:21:50,209
All right.

384
00:21:53,980 --> 00:21:55,848
Oh that's D right there.

385
00:21:55,882 --> 00:21:57,850
Tell him I said what's up.

386
00:21:57,884 --> 00:21:58,685
All right.

387
00:21:58,718 --> 00:21:59,419
What up, D?

388
00:22:01,588 --> 00:22:04,624
[Dr. Connors] Tell
me about your family.

389
00:22:04,657 --> 00:22:05,858
My family?

390
00:22:05,892 --> 00:22:06,726
[Dr. Connors] Yes.

391
00:22:08,761 --> 00:22:09,596
Okay.

392
00:22:12,465 --> 00:22:14,233
My father died when I was 12

393
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:18,104
and my mother when I was 16.

394
00:22:19,539 --> 00:22:21,608
I got two younger
brothers and that's it.

395
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:25,945
[Dr. Connors] Tell
me about your brothers.

396
00:22:25,978 --> 00:22:27,714
There's not much to tell.

397
00:22:29,549 --> 00:22:31,818
Ethan is a gynecologist.

398
00:22:33,085 --> 00:22:35,788
- Really?
- Yeah, don't ask.

399
00:22:35,822 --> 00:22:39,526
And my youngest brother,
Devin, he's an engineer.

400
00:22:40,893 --> 00:22:43,195
[Dr. Connors] A
successful trio of brothers.

401
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:45,732
Yeah.

402
00:22:45,765 --> 00:22:46,666
We made it.

403
00:22:48,267 --> 00:22:50,236
[Dr. Connors] Thanks to you.

404
00:22:50,269 --> 00:22:52,071
You made sure
everyone succeeded.

405
00:22:54,073 --> 00:22:57,343
I don't know
about all of that.

406
00:22:57,376 --> 00:23:02,882
I never asked to be head
of estate and our affairs.

407
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,283
Can be a bit much.

408
00:23:05,618 --> 00:23:10,256
[Dr. Connors] The
financial responsibilities?

409
00:23:10,289 --> 00:23:13,726
Yeah.

410
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,194
[Dr. Connors] You
are in a position

411
00:23:15,227 --> 00:23:17,396
that most people would envy.

412
00:23:21,868 --> 00:23:23,770
If you can get
that form over to me

413
00:23:23,803 --> 00:23:26,105
as soon as possible, I
can get that form started.

414
00:23:28,741 --> 00:23:30,643
Thank you, Ms. Willis.

415
00:23:30,677 --> 00:23:31,944
Have a great day.

416
00:23:34,981 --> 00:23:39,185
I keep telling her
over and over again.

417
00:23:39,218 --> 00:23:41,654
Third time today and
she keeps calling

418
00:23:41,688 --> 00:23:43,289
over and over.

419
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:45,958
Guess she got tired of
hearing about it from me.

420
00:23:47,594 --> 00:23:51,464
Yeah, well if I was pregnant
at 16 I'd be nervous, too.

421
00:23:53,199 --> 00:23:54,233
Stop it.

422
00:23:56,002 --> 00:23:56,803
Hey, so.

423
00:23:58,471 --> 00:24:00,039
So?

424
00:24:00,072 --> 00:24:01,407
Ethan, silly.

425
00:24:02,809 --> 00:24:04,343
That.

426
00:24:04,376 --> 00:24:06,245
Yeah, did you
talk to him for me?

427
00:24:06,278 --> 00:24:08,280
I think he's seeing someone.

428
00:24:10,850 --> 00:24:12,284
Think or you know?

429
00:24:15,855 --> 00:24:17,524
Well, come on, Mia.

430
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:19,191
I mean your husband's
brother is fine

431
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:21,694
and I'm single,
looking to mingle

432
00:24:24,363 --> 00:24:25,798
You need to calm down.

433
00:24:28,768 --> 00:24:31,270
Well ever since the divorce

434
00:24:31,303 --> 00:24:33,673
I've been really looking forward

435
00:24:33,706 --> 00:24:35,274
to getting back on that horse,

436
00:24:35,307 --> 00:24:36,543
if you know what I'm saying.

437
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,512
Goodness.

438
00:24:39,546 --> 00:24:41,047
You're doing too much.

439
00:24:42,682 --> 00:24:44,584
You act like you're
keeping him all

440
00:24:44,617 --> 00:24:45,685
to yourself or something.

441
00:24:51,057 --> 00:24:51,891
What?

442
00:24:55,127 --> 00:24:56,863
(laughing)

443
00:24:56,896 --> 00:24:58,364
Oh I'm just playing, girl

444
00:24:58,397 --> 00:24:59,932
but if you could look
into that for me,

445
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:01,568
I'd really appreciate it.

446
00:25:01,601 --> 00:25:02,969
Hell, I'll even take
the youngest brother.

447
00:25:03,002 --> 00:25:03,970
I won't discriminate.

448
00:25:05,004 --> 00:25:06,438
Okay.

449
00:25:06,472 --> 00:25:07,940
I'll check into it again.

450
00:25:07,974 --> 00:25:08,641
Thank you.

451
00:25:23,723 --> 00:25:25,491
Regarding your
personal finances,

452
00:25:25,524 --> 00:25:28,995
you've taken a few hits
in the past few months.

453
00:25:29,028 --> 00:25:31,898
Your investments
have not panned out.

454
00:25:31,931 --> 00:25:36,235
Yeah, the company
is taking substantial

455
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,437
financial hits recently.

456
00:25:38,470 --> 00:25:40,539
I kind of saw it coming

457
00:25:40,573 --> 00:25:43,042
and I've been trying
to establish myself

458
00:25:43,075 --> 00:25:44,944
outside of Mason and Associates.

459
00:25:46,178 --> 00:25:47,580
Branching out?

460
00:25:47,614 --> 00:25:48,380
Yes, sir.

461
00:25:49,248 --> 00:25:50,583
Investments and such.

462
00:25:56,989 --> 00:25:57,824
I see.

463
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:01,861
The money just
isn't there, Jacob.

464
00:26:03,896 --> 00:26:06,365
Now, I can move some assets

465
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:08,635
from your family's
affairs, temporarily,

466
00:26:08,668 --> 00:26:11,370
to put you in a more
viable position.

467
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:14,373
No.

468
00:26:16,375 --> 00:26:20,246
Jacob, I've watched
you and your brothers

469
00:26:20,279 --> 00:26:22,481
take what your family left

470
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:26,018
and grow it into
generational wealth.

471
00:26:27,353 --> 00:26:29,689
I've been thoroughly
impressed with that growth.

472
00:26:31,223 --> 00:26:33,025
Which brings me to
my next question.

473
00:26:34,694 --> 00:26:36,528
From a personal standpoint,

474
00:26:36,562 --> 00:26:39,832
your money has been erratic
for the last year or so.

475
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,369
Is there something you
want to tell me, son?

476
00:26:48,474 --> 00:26:49,876
I don't know, Mr. Watkins.

477
00:26:51,377 --> 00:26:52,278
I don't even know.

478
00:26:53,445 --> 00:26:55,748
I mean I've made some moves.

479
00:26:57,049 --> 00:26:58,617
I didn't think it was this bad.

480
00:27:00,452 --> 00:27:02,755
Think I just need to slow down.

481
00:27:04,256 --> 00:27:05,992
Well, I can
restructure some things,

482
00:27:06,025 --> 00:27:08,928
put you on a more
restrictive budget

483
00:27:08,961 --> 00:27:10,529
until we get a grasp on it.

484
00:27:11,931 --> 00:27:15,034
That is if you don't
want to go with option A.

485
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:17,403
No.

486
00:27:18,570 --> 00:27:20,039
I don't want to touch
the family's assets

487
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:20,873
if I don't have to.

488
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:24,243
I understand.

489
00:27:27,179 --> 00:27:28,014
Good.

490
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:32,952
And can we keep this
between the two of us?

491
00:27:34,220 --> 00:27:35,788
I don't want to
worry my brothers.

492
00:27:38,124 --> 00:27:38,958
Absolutely.

493
00:27:49,001 --> 00:27:51,704
Sex is something
I've always needed

494
00:27:51,738 --> 00:27:52,671
to a certain degree.

495
00:27:54,506 --> 00:27:56,275
[Dr. Connors] Why?

496
00:27:56,308 --> 00:28:00,112
Is it purely for the
physical stimulation?

497
00:28:00,146 --> 00:28:00,813
No.

498
00:28:02,982 --> 00:28:04,250
I like being needed.

499
00:28:06,152 --> 00:28:06,986
Wanted.

500
00:28:08,755 --> 00:28:09,989
[Dr. Connors] By your husband?

501
00:28:12,491 --> 00:28:13,559
Of course.

502
00:28:16,528 --> 00:28:19,298
[Dr. Connors] You don't
ever feel the desire

503
00:28:19,331 --> 00:28:23,502
to be needed or
wanted by other men?

504
00:28:26,372 --> 00:28:27,539
Why would I?

505
00:28:29,809 --> 00:28:32,511
(sobbing)

506
00:28:32,544 --> 00:28:35,547
(screaming)

507
00:28:35,581 --> 00:28:38,084
(phone buzzing)

508
00:28:49,028 --> 00:28:50,229
Hey, honey.

509
00:28:52,464 --> 00:28:54,400
Yeah, I'm fine.

510
00:28:56,168 --> 00:28:58,437
Getting ready to head home.

511
00:28:58,470 --> 00:28:59,138
How are you?

512
00:29:03,843 --> 00:29:06,779
(soft tense music)

513
00:29:14,453 --> 00:29:17,023
(phone chimes)

514
00:29:27,266 --> 00:29:29,836
(phone chimes)

515
00:29:48,020 --> 00:29:51,123
(soft tense music)

516
00:29:51,157 --> 00:29:53,059
(eerie music)

517
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:54,060
[Jacob] You know
you can't sneak up

518
00:29:54,093 --> 00:29:55,227
on a black man like that.

519
00:29:55,261 --> 00:29:57,429
Almost knocked your ass out.

520
00:29:57,463 --> 00:30:00,099
You look like you saw a ghost.

521
00:30:00,132 --> 00:30:01,633
Yeah.

522
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:02,969
So, how was your day?

523
00:30:04,136 --> 00:30:05,037
Long.

524
00:30:08,074 --> 00:30:10,642
Well, I'm gonna
go take a shower.

525
00:30:10,676 --> 00:30:12,912
You should join me.

526
00:30:12,945 --> 00:30:13,612
I will.

527
00:30:14,947 --> 00:30:15,781
Good.

528
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:32,064

529
00:30:32,098 --> 00:30:33,866

00:30:56,322 --> 00:30:58,524
Yeah, think I'm ready.

537
00:31:01,327 --> 00:31:03,229
You think?

538
00:31:03,262 --> 00:31:05,064
You need to know
before you tell Jacob.

539
00:31:08,234 --> 00:31:09,035
You right.

540
00:31:11,537 --> 00:31:13,505
What's up with him, anyways?

541
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:16,408
Man, you know, I
really don't know.

542
00:31:16,442 --> 00:31:18,710
Maybe he's traveling or
handling some business,

543
00:31:18,744 --> 00:31:19,678
I guess, I don't know.

544
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:22,648
Did you tell him about
the Marietta property?

545
00:31:24,150 --> 00:31:25,985
Yeah, I did.

546
00:31:26,018 --> 00:31:27,886
You know J's cool with
whatever it is we decide

547
00:31:27,920 --> 00:31:29,155
as long as it's nothing crazy.

548
00:31:29,188 --> 00:31:31,323
I mean I handle all the
property stuff anyway

549
00:31:31,357 --> 00:31:34,126
and he handles the
investment stuff, so.

550
00:31:34,160 --> 00:31:35,327
What about me?

551
00:31:35,361 --> 00:31:36,695
You just freeload.

552
00:31:36,728 --> 00:31:37,696
(laughing)

553
00:31:37,729 --> 00:31:39,365
Wow.

554
00:31:39,398 --> 00:31:40,632
Man, whatever.

555
00:31:40,666 --> 00:31:43,502
Y'all need anything
though, let me know.

556
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:45,071
Oh you good, bro.

557
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:47,639
You just make sure you put that
engineering degree to work.

558
00:31:47,673 --> 00:31:48,307
I can dig that.

559
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:51,677
So what you think about
me telling J about Alice?

560
00:31:54,046 --> 00:31:55,447
I don't know.

561
00:31:55,481 --> 00:31:57,249
Just tell him and
see what he say?

562
00:31:59,618 --> 00:32:02,454
I mean, it's just so hard to
catch up with him these days.

563
00:32:04,023 --> 00:32:06,058
Yeah, it is.

564
00:32:06,092 --> 00:32:08,227
Maybe you should stop by his job

565
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:09,962
or catch him at the crib.

566
00:32:12,298 --> 00:32:13,132
I can do that.

567
00:32:14,100 --> 00:32:14,933
Yeah.

568
00:32:16,102 --> 00:32:18,704
Baby brother is
getting married.

569
00:32:18,737 --> 00:32:20,439
Man, I never thought
I'd see the day.

570
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:23,675
This could be you, man.

571
00:32:23,709 --> 00:32:25,377
If you play your cards right.

572
00:32:25,411 --> 00:32:26,545
I play my cards right.

573
00:32:28,747 --> 00:32:29,581
Okay.

574
00:32:40,759 --> 00:32:43,429
(phone buzzing)

575
00:32:45,697 --> 00:32:46,798
Hey, Daisy.

576
00:32:48,634 --> 00:32:53,005
Nothing just sitting here
planning out my vacation.

577
00:32:55,274 --> 00:32:57,076
I know right, if
I ever take one.

578
00:32:58,810 --> 00:32:59,578
What's up?

579
00:33:01,947 --> 00:33:03,982
No, that sounds fine.

580
00:33:05,551 --> 00:33:11,323
I'm just sitting here, just
finished up your caseload

581
00:33:11,357 --> 00:33:12,058
from when you were out.

582
00:33:14,260 --> 00:33:16,862
Yeah, I can bring everything
to the office tomorrow.

583
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:22,334
Okay, sounds good.

584
00:33:23,802 --> 00:33:25,737
See you then.

585
00:33:25,771 --> 00:33:26,438
Bye.

Okay, so.

595
00:33:59,305 --> 00:34:01,140
He really is a nice guy

596
00:34:01,173 --> 00:34:04,243
I just I don't know
if I'm that into him,

597
00:34:04,276 --> 00:34:06,011
if you know what I'm saying.

598
00:34:07,479 --> 00:34:08,647
What's wrong with him?

599
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:11,117
He's passive.

600
00:34:13,085 --> 00:34:14,052
Okay

601
00:34:14,086 --> 00:34:16,788
Like, really passive.

602
00:34:16,822 --> 00:34:20,659
Like I'm having to
initiate everything.

603
00:34:20,692 --> 00:34:23,262
Although he is really
good in the bedroom.

604
00:34:23,295 --> 00:34:24,963
Then what's wrong
with him being passive?

605
00:34:26,465 --> 00:34:28,934
I feel like I'm supposed
to be teaching him things

606
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:30,702
that he should already know.

607
00:34:30,736 --> 00:34:34,039
Although he does take
direction exceptionally well.

608
00:34:34,072 --> 00:34:38,877
I just, I don't want to be
coaching when I'm in the moment.

609
00:34:38,910 --> 00:34:40,846
Well you have to communicate.

610
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:43,982
How else is your partner
supposed to know what you like?

611
00:34:44,015 --> 00:34:46,185
By the screaming
and the moaning.

612
00:34:46,218 --> 00:34:48,120
(laughing)

613
00:34:48,154 --> 00:34:48,954
No.

614
00:34:48,987 --> 00:34:50,189
No, seriously.

615
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:51,690
I mean like all the
signs are right there.

616
00:34:55,026 --> 00:34:57,229
So what are you doing,
is everything okay?

617
00:34:58,397 --> 00:34:59,198
Um.

618
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:02,734
Yeah.

619
00:35:05,237 --> 00:35:06,071
Yeah.

620
00:35:06,972 --> 00:35:09,007
I gotta get going.

621
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:09,708
You good?

622
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:12,778
Oh yeah, I'm good.

623
00:35:12,811 --> 00:35:15,747
I'm probably just gonna
do another mile or so

624
00:35:15,781 --> 00:35:17,849
before I wrap it up here.

625
00:35:17,883 --> 00:35:19,050
[Mia] Sweet.

626
00:35:19,084 --> 00:35:19,885
Call you later?

627
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:20,586
All right.

628
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:22,821
- All right.
- Bye.

629
00:35:33,999 --> 00:35:35,867
Yeah, it's crazy as hell, man.

630
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:39,171
I mean she emailing,
calling, texting nonstop.

631
00:35:40,372 --> 00:35:41,407
So why'd you do it?

632
00:35:42,341 --> 00:35:43,175
Do what?

633
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:45,811
Come on, man.

634
00:35:45,844 --> 00:35:46,978
Do I have to spell it out?

635
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:52,584
F-U...
All right, enough, enough.

636
00:35:52,618 --> 00:35:54,052
You got a wife at home.

637
00:35:54,085 --> 00:35:54,886
So why'd you do it?

638
00:35:56,455 --> 00:35:58,089
I mean, you know, Mia and I

639
00:35:58,123 --> 00:36:00,158
been in this weird space
for the past couple years.

640
00:36:01,560 --> 00:36:04,230
Okay, but y'all are
working on it, aren't all?

641
00:36:04,263 --> 00:36:05,464
[Jacob] Something like that.

642
00:36:05,497 --> 00:36:06,932
And you still love her, right?

643
00:36:08,400 --> 00:36:09,768
Yes.

644
00:36:09,801 --> 00:36:12,804
Okay, then get rid
of this psycho chick.

645
00:36:12,838 --> 00:36:14,039
Get rid of the chick?

646
00:36:14,072 --> 00:36:15,307
That's your advice, huh?

647
00:36:15,341 --> 00:36:16,242
Yeah, man.

648
00:36:16,275 --> 00:36:17,943
It's simple yet it's effective.

649
00:36:19,411 --> 00:36:20,246
Why not?

650
00:36:21,213 --> 00:36:22,848
Oh and don't worry,

651
00:36:22,881 --> 00:36:25,016
I'ma send you a bill in
the mail, you're welcome.

652
00:36:25,050 --> 00:36:27,386
Look, it was a one time
thing when I was in D.C.

653
00:36:29,087 --> 00:36:31,723
Man, honestly,
you know I'm happily

654
00:36:31,757 --> 00:36:33,659
and faithfully with my girl,

655
00:36:33,692 --> 00:36:35,494
so I don't know
what to tell you.

656
00:36:35,527 --> 00:36:37,263
Maybe you should run it by E.

657
00:36:37,296 --> 00:36:37,963
No.

658
00:36:39,831 --> 00:36:42,067
Y'all beefing again, man?

659
00:36:42,100 --> 00:36:42,768
Aint no beef.

660
00:36:43,969 --> 00:36:45,471
Now you know as
smart as you are,

661
00:36:45,504 --> 00:36:46,705
you suck at lying.

662
00:36:49,341 --> 00:36:52,177
Like I aint got
no issues with him.

663
00:36:52,210 --> 00:36:54,580
Okay, if you say so.

664
00:36:54,613 --> 00:36:56,014
Look, why are you here?

665
00:36:57,015 --> 00:36:58,684
Oh.

666
00:36:59,551 --> 00:37:00,586
I got you.

667
00:37:00,619 --> 00:37:01,587
Get this right here.

668
00:37:06,358 --> 00:37:07,859
What's that?

669
00:37:07,893 --> 00:37:09,094
Really?

670
00:37:09,127 --> 00:37:11,129
You know I'm starting
to doubt we're related.

671
00:37:11,162 --> 00:37:13,031
This is a ring.

672
00:37:13,064 --> 00:37:14,800
I know it's a ring, genius.

673
00:37:14,833 --> 00:37:15,901
Who is it for?

674
00:37:15,934 --> 00:37:17,135
- Alice.
- Alice?

675
00:37:17,168 --> 00:37:17,836
Yeah.

676
00:37:19,271 --> 00:37:21,640
The Alice you've been
with for like five months?

677
00:37:21,673 --> 00:37:22,341
Same one.

678
00:37:24,676 --> 00:37:26,378
Okay.

679
00:37:26,412 --> 00:37:27,646
Okay?

680
00:37:27,679 --> 00:37:28,447
That's it?

681
00:37:30,115 --> 00:37:32,518
What you want me to say?

682
00:37:32,551 --> 00:37:34,953
I don't know, congrats,

683
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:37,155
I'm proud of you,
little brother.

684
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:39,190
Something a loving
family member would say.

685
00:37:40,158 --> 00:37:41,259
I'm happy for you.

686
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:45,531
Now you know that
was fake as hell.

687
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:49,100
Look man, is five
months really enough?

688
00:37:50,168 --> 00:37:52,738
I mean is a year, two, three?

689
00:37:52,771 --> 00:37:54,373
I mean, shoot, look
at you and Mia.

690
00:37:58,176 --> 00:38:00,379
That's not what I meant, bro.

691
00:38:00,412 --> 00:38:03,315
Look, all I'm saying is for me,

692
00:38:03,349 --> 00:38:05,617
yeah, five months is enough.

693
00:38:10,021 --> 00:38:11,557
Okay.

694
00:38:11,590 --> 00:38:14,926
Well, I am happy for you.

695
00:38:14,960 --> 00:38:16,127
Congratulations.

696
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:25,404
(soft tense music)

697
00:38:26,772 --> 00:38:27,906
Hey.

698
00:38:27,939 --> 00:38:28,607
Hey.

699
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:33,078
I'm glad you could make
it on such short notice.

700
00:38:33,111 --> 00:38:34,079
It's fine.

701
00:38:34,112 --> 00:38:35,881
I was free today.

702
00:38:35,914 --> 00:38:36,582
Good.

703
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:41,119
Well, have a seat.

704
00:38:41,152 --> 00:38:42,488
Thank you.

705
00:38:42,521 --> 00:38:43,755
You're welcome.

706
00:38:46,958 --> 00:38:47,793
Okay.

707
00:38:49,194 --> 00:38:50,796
So I told myself I
wasn't gonna beat around

708
00:38:50,829 --> 00:38:52,931
the bush when I told you this

709
00:38:52,964 --> 00:38:54,032
and then I wasn't
gonna get all dramatic

710
00:38:54,065 --> 00:38:54,800
once I told you.

711
00:38:56,768 --> 00:38:57,536
What is it?

712
00:38:58,904 --> 00:38:59,905
I'm seeing someone.

713
00:39:02,374 --> 00:39:03,208
Oh.

714
00:39:05,377 --> 00:39:06,878
Is that all you have to say?

715
00:39:09,247 --> 00:39:10,782
Why are you telling me this?

716
00:39:12,384 --> 00:39:14,553
The reason I'm
telling you is twofold.

717
00:39:15,521 --> 00:39:16,888
Okay.

718
00:39:16,922 --> 00:39:18,757
One and probably the
most obvious reason,

719
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:22,327
is that whatever is
this we are doing

720
00:39:23,462 --> 00:39:24,396
it can't continue

721
00:39:25,997 --> 00:39:27,098
and the other

722
00:39:29,501 --> 00:39:31,369
I think we should
tell Jacob about us.

723
00:39:34,305 --> 00:39:35,273
Excuse me?

724
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:36,742
Just hear me out.

725
00:39:36,775 --> 00:39:38,877
Have you lost your damn mind?

726
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:41,613
You had no problem
sleeping with me

727
00:39:41,647 --> 00:39:42,548
when you didn't have anyone

728
00:39:42,581 --> 00:39:43,482
now all of a sudden you do

729
00:39:43,515 --> 00:39:44,750
you want to blow my life up?

730
00:39:44,783 --> 00:39:45,984
That's not what
I'm trying to do.

731
00:39:46,017 --> 00:39:47,619
Then what are
you doing, Ethan?

732
00:39:47,653 --> 00:39:50,155
Please keep your voice down.

733
00:39:50,188 --> 00:39:51,256
How dare you?

734
00:39:52,724 --> 00:39:54,726
I'm just trying to build
something with my brother,

735
00:39:54,760 --> 00:39:56,227
that's all.

736
00:39:56,261 --> 00:39:57,763
And telling him that you've
been sleeping with his wife

737
00:39:57,796 --> 00:39:59,264
is gonna do that?

738
00:39:59,297 --> 00:40:02,468
No by telling him about
us before he met you.

739
00:40:04,803 --> 00:40:06,972
You're a piece of work.

740
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:07,873
Don't be like that.

741
00:40:09,207 --> 00:40:10,041
Go to hell.

742
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:16,682
Brother or not, if
I see you around me

743
00:40:16,715 --> 00:40:19,217
or my husband again,
I'll kill you.

744
00:40:20,752 --> 00:40:23,689
(soft tense music)

745
00:40:29,394 --> 00:40:30,228
Mia.

746
00:40:36,367 --> 00:40:39,738
(tense electronic music)

747
00:40:41,439 --> 00:40:42,841
Yes, sir.

748
00:40:42,874 --> 00:40:44,275
Okay, thank you
for your business.

749
00:40:51,917 --> 00:40:52,884
(knocking)

750
00:40:52,918 --> 00:40:53,552
Come in.

751
00:40:56,488 --> 00:40:57,455
Sir.

752
00:40:57,489 --> 00:40:58,757
Jacob.

753
00:40:58,790 --> 00:41:01,593
I have someone that
I want you to meet.

754
00:41:01,627 --> 00:41:03,662
She's new to the firm.

755
00:41:03,695 --> 00:41:04,530
Okay.

756
00:41:04,563 --> 00:41:06,031
Mr. Patterson.

757
00:41:06,064 --> 00:41:09,300
I've heard so many
good things about you.

758
00:41:09,334 --> 00:41:10,669
All good things, I hope.

759
00:41:10,702 --> 00:41:11,903
Of course.

760
00:41:11,937 --> 00:41:15,173
Ms. Cooper here seems to
be a big fan of yours.

761
00:41:15,206 --> 00:41:17,809
She has done a lot of
research on you, Jacob

762
00:41:17,843 --> 00:41:20,245
and the company of course.

763
00:41:20,278 --> 00:41:25,116
So, in fact, I figured
that a partnership

764
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:28,453
between the two of you
would be most beneficial.

765
00:41:28,486 --> 00:41:29,721
Partnership?

766
00:41:29,755 --> 00:41:31,189
Yes.

767
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:35,360
Ms. Cooper here has experience
with Esquire Incorporated.

768
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:37,696
So, of course,
once they got wind

769
00:41:37,729 --> 00:41:39,998
that we were bringing her on,

770
00:41:40,031 --> 00:41:43,969
they decided to renegotiate
our contracts with them.

771
00:41:44,002 --> 00:41:45,170
Of course.

772
00:41:45,203 --> 00:41:47,706
As Mr. Reed stated,
I'm here to help

773
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:49,608
in anyway that I can.

774
00:41:49,641 --> 00:41:50,876
I see.

775
00:41:50,909 --> 00:41:51,710
(laughing)

776
00:41:51,743 --> 00:41:52,978
Fantastic.

777
00:41:53,011 --> 00:41:56,582
All right well, I will
leave you two to it.

778
00:41:56,615 --> 00:41:58,717
Make me some money.

779
00:41:58,750 --> 00:41:59,384
Thank you, sir.

780
00:42:01,620 --> 00:42:04,455
What the hell are you doing?

781
00:42:04,489 --> 00:42:05,290
Helping.

782
00:42:05,323 --> 00:42:07,125
You're crazy.

783
00:42:07,158 --> 00:42:09,628
Yeah but you love it.

784
00:42:09,661 --> 00:42:10,929
We're not doing this.

785
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:11,763
Why?

786
00:42:11,797 --> 00:42:12,764
Why?

787
00:42:12,798 --> 00:42:14,465
Because I'm married.

788
00:42:14,499 --> 00:42:16,067
Yeah but are you?

789
00:42:16,101 --> 00:42:16,768
Stop.

790
00:42:18,536 --> 00:42:19,638
Do you really...

791
00:42:19,671 --> 00:42:20,739
Stop.

792
00:42:23,909 --> 00:42:25,476
Your wife is pretty.

793
00:42:27,512 --> 00:42:30,782
She likes to work
out on Tuesdays,

794
00:42:30,816 --> 00:42:33,919
go for a run with her
friend on Thursdays

795
00:42:33,952 --> 00:42:35,687
then a matinee on Friday,

796
00:42:35,721 --> 00:42:38,189
picking up
prescriptions, dog food,

797
00:42:38,223 --> 00:42:41,392
and then coffee at eight
a.m. every morning.

798
00:42:42,460 --> 00:42:44,395
She is particular.

799
00:42:45,563 --> 00:42:48,667
Predictable yet
strangely alluring.

800
00:42:52,470 --> 00:42:54,940
I wonder if she would like me?

801
00:42:56,808 --> 00:42:58,343
What do you want?

802
00:43:01,546 --> 00:43:02,380
You.

803
00:43:03,381 --> 00:43:06,051
(ominous music)

804
00:43:09,988 --> 00:43:12,691
[Dr. Connors] You seem
a bit distracted today.

805
00:43:12,724 --> 00:43:14,559
Is everything all right?

806
00:43:17,495 --> 00:43:20,031
What would you like me
to focus on, Dr. Connors?

807
00:43:21,232 --> 00:43:22,467
- [Dr. Connors]
The time is yours.

808
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:25,804
I'm here for you, you know?

809
00:43:27,172 --> 00:43:28,006
Are you?

810
00:43:29,775 --> 00:43:32,577
What have you done, Dr. Connors?

811
00:43:33,712 --> 00:43:35,647
What have you done
for me and my husband?

812
00:43:38,650 --> 00:43:41,787
You sit there and you
ask all these questions

813
00:43:41,820 --> 00:43:44,322
and you feed us
delusions of grandeur,

814
00:43:47,025 --> 00:43:48,393
what are you expecting to get

815
00:43:48,426 --> 00:43:51,129
from these sessions,
Dr. Connors?

816
00:43:53,298 --> 00:43:55,300
[Dr. Connors] That's
completely up to you, Mia.

817
00:43:56,501 --> 00:44:00,538
My purpose is to ask
the hard questions

818
00:44:00,571 --> 00:44:02,473
and to get you to
think outside your box.

819
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:07,512
What you get out
of these sessions

820
00:44:07,545 --> 00:44:09,214
is entirely up to you.

821
00:44:17,689 --> 00:44:20,692
(eerie tense music)

822
00:44:56,661 --> 00:44:59,464
It's been a long ass day.

823
00:44:59,497 --> 00:45:01,432
Yeah, you're wearing it.

824
00:45:01,466 --> 00:45:02,700
You look tired, bro.

825
00:45:02,734 --> 00:45:03,501
Yeah.

826
00:45:05,370 --> 00:45:06,805
But look, um.

827
00:45:06,838 --> 00:45:09,107
You think you gonna make
it out to the dinner?

828
00:45:09,140 --> 00:45:10,608
I don't know, depending
on what time it is

829
00:45:10,641 --> 00:45:13,144
I might be able to get out
there for a little bit.

830
00:45:13,178 --> 00:45:15,613
You know I got a lot
going on right now, man.

831
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:16,848
Okay.

832
00:45:16,882 --> 00:45:18,483
Well I mean, just let me know.

833
00:45:18,516 --> 00:45:20,385
We'll work it out.

834
00:45:20,418 --> 00:45:21,086
Aight.

835
00:45:22,587 --> 00:45:24,255
E, what's up?

836
00:45:26,024 --> 00:45:27,358
We have a problem.

837
00:45:27,392 --> 00:45:28,726
Problem?

838
00:45:28,760 --> 00:45:30,228
What's wrong?

839
00:45:30,261 --> 00:45:34,099
I just left the property
up in Jonesboro, lot eight,

840
00:45:34,132 --> 00:45:35,100
and it's been sold.

841
00:45:36,567 --> 00:45:38,703
My key doesn't even work.

842
00:45:38,736 --> 00:45:41,472
So did you flip it or
something without telling us?

843
00:45:41,506 --> 00:45:43,008
Sold, what you mean sold?

844
00:45:43,041 --> 00:45:44,575
It's been sold, Jacob.

845
00:45:44,609 --> 00:45:46,077
It's gone.

846
00:45:46,111 --> 00:45:47,478
Gone?

847
00:45:47,512 --> 00:45:49,047
Wait, I'm confused.

848
00:45:49,080 --> 00:45:50,481
Look, I didn't sell anything.

849
00:45:51,749 --> 00:45:53,819
See, this is exactly why

850
00:45:53,852 --> 00:45:55,386
I felt that we all
should have power

851
00:45:55,420 --> 00:45:57,022
of attorney over our
estate's affairs.

852
00:45:57,055 --> 00:45:58,189
Look, calm down, E.

853
00:45:58,223 --> 00:45:59,024
- Calm down?
- I'm sure it's

854
00:45:59,057 --> 00:46:00,258
just a misunderstanding.

855
00:46:00,291 --> 00:46:01,927
Let me make a call and
see what's going on.

856
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,494
I know what's going on.

857
00:46:03,528 --> 00:46:05,230
Your company is suffering.

858
00:46:06,364 --> 00:46:09,734
You're losing clients,
bad investments.

859
00:46:09,767 --> 00:46:11,602
So maybe you needed it, huh?

860
00:46:11,636 --> 00:46:14,039
But if you needed it, you
could of at least told us.

861
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,509
That's right.

862
00:46:18,543 --> 00:46:19,777
I spoke to Mr. Watkins.

863
00:46:20,879 --> 00:46:22,914
You know what he said?

864
00:46:22,948 --> 00:46:26,017
That he didn't want us involved.

865
00:46:28,987 --> 00:46:31,456
You in a real bad spot, man.

866
00:46:31,489 --> 00:46:33,124
Personally.

867
00:46:33,158 --> 00:46:35,660
So maybe, huh?

868
00:46:35,693 --> 00:46:37,195
All right, look, E, relax.

869
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:39,497
I'm sure we'll figure this out.

870
00:46:39,530 --> 00:46:40,431
Yeah.

871
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:42,100
You got something to say to me?

872
00:46:42,133 --> 00:46:43,334
I think I just said it.

873
00:46:43,368 --> 00:46:45,236
I think you need
to be real clear

874
00:46:45,270 --> 00:46:47,338
about what you saying to me.

875
00:46:47,372 --> 00:46:48,273
All right, relax.

876
00:46:48,306 --> 00:46:50,075
It's not that serious, guys.

877
00:46:50,108 --> 00:46:52,143
J, pick up the
phone, make the call,

878
00:46:52,177 --> 00:46:53,511
see what's going on.

879
00:46:53,544 --> 00:46:55,546
E, you and me,
let's grab some air.

880
00:46:56,447 --> 00:46:58,549
Yeah, let's do that.

881
00:47:09,995 --> 00:47:11,496
Look like you could use one.

882
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:15,300
Thanks.

883
00:47:24,442 --> 00:47:25,343
Everything okay?

884
00:47:26,744 --> 00:47:30,315
Yeah, we just had a slight
issue today with Ethan.

885
00:47:30,348 --> 00:47:31,382
Issue, why?

886
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:34,920
I mean, what happened?

887
00:47:36,387 --> 00:47:39,958
One of our properties got
sold off without my knowledge.

888
00:47:39,991 --> 00:47:41,859
Trying to figure
out what happened.

889
00:47:41,893 --> 00:47:44,229
Can they do that
without your authority?

890
00:47:44,262 --> 00:47:45,230
I don't know.

891
00:47:45,263 --> 00:47:46,097
Well did you contact the...

892
00:47:46,131 --> 00:47:46,831
Yes, Mia!

893
00:47:48,633 --> 00:47:49,467
Sorry.

894
00:47:50,368 --> 00:47:51,736
No, it's fine.

895
00:47:51,769 --> 00:47:54,372
I'm sorry, I'm just
a little worked up.

896
00:47:54,405 --> 00:47:55,473
I understand.

897
00:47:58,309 --> 00:48:00,278
Did you speak to
Ethan about my job?

898
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:04,082
What do you mean?

899
00:48:05,550 --> 00:48:08,920
Nothing, don't worry about it.

900
00:48:08,954 --> 00:48:12,023
But other than that, he's
just been blowing me up

901
00:48:12,057 --> 00:48:13,024
saying we need to talk.

902
00:48:14,692 --> 00:48:16,427
About what?

903
00:48:16,461 --> 00:48:17,662
I don't know, you know him.

904
00:48:17,695 --> 00:48:20,598
He's just, he just
keeps hitting me up

905
00:48:20,631 --> 00:48:22,968
saying we need to talk.

906
00:48:23,001 --> 00:48:24,002
Talk about what?

907
00:48:25,203 --> 00:48:27,238
I mean, your guess
is as good as mine.

908
00:48:27,272 --> 00:48:28,639
Probably just
needs me to come in

909
00:48:28,673 --> 00:48:30,341
and course correct or something.

910
00:48:34,445 --> 00:48:35,280
I um.

911
00:48:39,317 --> 00:48:41,186
I slept with Ethan.

912
00:48:41,219 --> 00:48:43,854
(ominous music)

913
00:48:43,888 --> 00:48:45,556
I met him a year
before I met you

914
00:48:45,590 --> 00:48:49,027
and I'm sorry, I
should of told you.

915
00:48:52,597 --> 00:48:55,266
(ominous music)

916
00:48:56,167 --> 00:48:57,002
I'm sorry.

917
00:49:03,341 --> 00:49:04,475
Please say something.

918
00:49:04,509 --> 00:49:06,711
Get your goddamn hands off me.

919
00:49:06,744 --> 00:49:09,247
(ominous music)

920
00:49:31,602 --> 00:49:32,570
[Dr. Connors] Mia.

921
00:49:35,340 --> 00:49:36,707
Are you all right?

922
00:49:41,379 --> 00:49:42,213
I'm uh.

923
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:45,883
I'm just tired.

924
00:49:48,419 --> 00:49:49,720
[Dr. Connors] I understand.

925
00:49:54,625 --> 00:49:56,827
Can we skip today, please?

926
00:49:57,695 --> 00:49:58,963
[Dr. Connors] Of course.

927
00:50:13,278 --> 00:50:16,147
(ominous music)

928
00:50:16,181 --> 00:50:17,782
All you need is me.

929
00:50:20,451 --> 00:50:21,886
I'll take care of you.

930
00:50:26,157 --> 00:50:27,958
Everything happens for a reason.

931
00:51:07,365 --> 00:51:10,034
(phone ringing)

932
00:51:14,372 --> 00:51:16,541
This is Jacob Patterson.

933
00:51:18,743 --> 00:51:20,378
No, I haven't spoken to her.

934
00:51:21,212 --> 00:51:22,413
Did you try to call her?

935
00:51:25,150 --> 00:51:26,851
I'm not sure why
she's not there.

936
00:51:28,853 --> 00:51:29,687
Yes.

937
00:51:30,621 --> 00:51:31,522
Yes.

938
00:51:32,690 --> 00:51:33,524
I understand.

939
00:51:34,959 --> 00:51:35,793
Okay.

940
00:51:58,349 --> 00:51:59,617
Hey, Mia.

941
00:51:59,650 --> 00:52:01,186
Your job just called me.

942
00:52:01,219 --> 00:52:04,689
They said you haven't been to
work in the past couple days.

943
00:52:04,722 --> 00:52:07,325
They haven't heard
anything from you.

944
00:52:07,358 --> 00:52:08,926
Give me a call
when you get this.

945
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:22,707
(eerie ominous music)

946
00:52:32,483 --> 00:52:33,318
Mia.

947
00:52:37,222 --> 00:52:38,055
Mia.

948
00:52:43,228 --> 00:52:44,829
Mia.

949
00:52:44,862 --> 00:52:47,698
(eerie tense music)

950
00:52:54,939 --> 00:52:56,073
Mia, Mia, Mia.

951
00:52:57,708 --> 00:53:00,611
(eerie tense music)

952
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:06,317
[Watts] Mia Patterson, 33.

953
00:53:06,351 --> 00:53:08,185
Apparent overdose on
prescription pills.

954
00:53:09,620 --> 00:53:11,689
Come on, man, what is this?

955
00:53:11,722 --> 00:53:12,523
[Sykes] Relax, sir.

956
00:53:12,557 --> 00:53:14,225
It's just a formality.

957
00:53:14,259 --> 00:53:15,159
Formality?

958
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,361
My partner, Detective Sykes,

959
00:53:16,394 --> 00:53:18,729
likes to use fancy
words and shit

960
00:53:18,763 --> 00:53:21,499
but I'm Watts and we'll be
handling your wife's case.

961
00:53:21,532 --> 00:53:22,367
What case?

962
00:53:23,668 --> 00:53:26,103
[Sykes] Well, we
discovered certain anomalies

963
00:53:26,136 --> 00:53:28,506
involving your wife's death.

964
00:53:28,539 --> 00:53:29,974
Oh my god, man.

965
00:53:30,007 --> 00:53:31,208
[Watts] How many properties
do you own, Mr. Patterson?

966
00:53:31,242 --> 00:53:32,477
What's that got
to do with anything?

967
00:53:32,510 --> 00:53:34,579
You've recently had
some financial issues

968
00:53:34,612 --> 00:53:36,481
that lead to you selling
off one of your properties.

969
00:53:36,514 --> 00:53:37,982
I see you recently
made changes

970
00:53:38,015 --> 00:53:40,651
to your insurance policy,
for you and your wife.

971
00:53:40,685 --> 00:53:42,119
[Jacob] Wait, what?

972
00:53:42,152 --> 00:53:43,354
Is that your signature?

973
00:53:43,388 --> 00:53:44,855
Yeah, I signed it

974
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:46,023
but my wife normally takes
care of all this stuff.

975
00:53:46,056 --> 00:53:48,125
[Watts] Prescription
changes as well,

976
00:53:48,158 --> 00:53:49,093
which you picked up.

977
00:53:51,161 --> 00:53:53,731
Look man, what
are y'all saying?

978
00:53:53,764 --> 00:53:55,500
We're not saying anything.

979
00:53:55,533 --> 00:53:57,368
We're just asking questions.

980
00:53:58,603 --> 00:53:59,637
[Watts] What are
y'all nervous for?

981
00:53:59,670 --> 00:54:01,672
It's just a few questions.

982
00:54:01,706 --> 00:54:02,373
I'm not.

983
00:54:03,441 --> 00:54:04,342
Am I a suspect?

984
00:54:05,343 --> 00:54:06,611
Because if so, maybe I need to...

985
00:54:06,644 --> 00:54:08,546
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

986
00:54:08,579 --> 00:54:12,450
Mr. Collin Hicks, Mr.
Patterson's legal representation

987
00:54:12,483 --> 00:54:13,651
and if we're done here,

988
00:54:13,684 --> 00:54:15,252
I would like to
take my client down

989
00:54:15,286 --> 00:54:17,121
to identify his wife's body.

990
00:54:17,154 --> 00:54:18,055
(laughing)

991
00:54:18,088 --> 00:54:20,157
Lawyered up real quick, huh?

992
00:54:20,190 --> 00:54:21,359
I see you.

993
00:54:21,392 --> 00:54:22,360
Thank you, gentleman.

994
00:54:22,393 --> 00:54:23,060
Mr. Patterson.

995
00:54:31,836 --> 00:54:32,937
What do you think?

996
00:54:32,970 --> 00:54:34,305
I'm not sure just yet

997
00:54:34,339 --> 00:54:35,606
but let's check into
his wife's financial

998
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:36,874
to see what we come up with.

999
00:54:36,907 --> 00:54:37,575
Roger that.

1000
00:54:39,844 --> 00:54:42,246
What is this and who are you?

1001
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,614
I'm your lawyer,
Mr. Patterson.

1002
00:54:43,648 --> 00:54:44,315
My lawyer?

1003
00:54:45,249 --> 00:54:47,117
My lawyer is an old white dude

1004
00:54:47,151 --> 00:54:48,819
and you sir are not him.

1005
00:54:48,853 --> 00:54:51,322
Look, I'm well aware of
your current representation,

1006
00:54:51,356 --> 00:54:53,458
I was referred by
a mutual contact

1007
00:54:53,491 --> 00:54:55,726
who thought I could
assist with this matter.

1008
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:57,161
Matter?

1009
00:54:57,194 --> 00:54:59,063
Look, my wife is dead.

1010
00:54:59,096 --> 00:55:01,231
I'm just trying to
figure all this out.

1011
00:55:01,265 --> 00:55:04,469
Precisely and I'm here
to help figure things out

1012
00:55:04,502 --> 00:55:06,303
but, Mr. Patterson,
we need to go

1013
00:55:06,337 --> 00:55:07,672
and identify your wife's body.

1014
00:55:09,907 --> 00:55:12,042
Just trying to
get some answers.

1015
00:55:12,076 --> 00:55:14,078
I'm trying to
give them to you.

1016
00:55:14,111 --> 00:55:14,945
Now, please.

1017
00:55:29,727 --> 00:55:30,761
I'm scared.

1018
00:55:34,399 --> 00:55:36,467
[Dr. Connors] Why
are you scared, Mia?

1019
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:45,142
(tense electronic music)
(sobbing)

1020
00:56:04,361 --> 00:56:05,696
Mr. Patterson.

1021
00:56:09,567 --> 00:56:12,970
(tense electronic music)

1022
00:56:24,214 --> 00:56:27,685
And they think that you
had something to do with it?

1023
00:56:27,718 --> 00:56:28,719
I don't know what
they're thinking.

1024
00:56:29,920 --> 00:56:33,257
They looking at the
money, the properties,

1025
00:56:33,290 --> 00:56:33,958
all of it.

1026
00:56:35,192 --> 00:56:36,961
Damn.

1027
00:56:36,994 --> 00:56:38,429
I'm just trying to process it.

1028
00:56:39,363 --> 00:56:40,197
Yeah.

1029
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:44,435
Bro.

1030
00:56:44,469 --> 00:56:45,269
What's good?

1031
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:47,071
How you feeling?

1032
00:56:47,104 --> 00:56:48,038
Good, man.

1033
00:56:48,072 --> 00:56:50,908
(eerie tense music)

1034
00:56:51,809 --> 00:56:53,410
Oh man, I'm sorry.

1035
00:56:53,444 --> 00:56:55,580
This is my fiancee
Alexis Cooper.

1036
00:56:55,613 --> 00:56:56,581
Alexis.

1037
00:56:56,614 --> 00:56:57,281
Fiancee?

1038
00:56:58,949 --> 00:57:01,619
There must be something
in this water.

1039
00:57:01,652 --> 00:57:04,021
How did you manage
to keep that a secret

1040
00:57:04,054 --> 00:57:06,090
from the two of us for so long?

1041
00:57:06,123 --> 00:57:08,926
Well, that's why I've
been blowing you two up.

1042
00:57:08,959 --> 00:57:10,394
I wanted to tell y'all together.

1043
00:57:13,097 --> 00:57:15,199
She's been back and
forth out of town

1044
00:57:15,232 --> 00:57:16,934
and you know we've
been kind of on and off

1045
00:57:16,967 --> 00:57:19,637
and finally I decided
to make it official

1046
00:57:19,670 --> 00:57:21,405
and once we got the
news about Mia...

1047
00:57:24,509 --> 00:57:25,342
I'm sorry, J.

1048
00:57:26,511 --> 00:57:27,311
Well.

1049
00:57:30,080 --> 00:57:31,616
Devin, I presume?

1050
00:57:31,649 --> 00:57:32,449
Nice to meet you.

1051
00:57:32,483 --> 00:57:33,150
You, too.

1052
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:37,021
And you must be Jacob.

1053
00:57:37,888 --> 00:57:40,658
I've heard a lot about you.

1054
00:57:40,691 --> 00:57:42,359
Bitch, you need to get
the hell out of my house.

1055
00:57:42,392 --> 00:57:43,293
Wait, whoa, whoa.

1056
00:57:43,327 --> 00:57:44,595
What the hell is wrong with you?

1057
00:57:44,629 --> 00:57:47,264
She's here to support me.

1058
00:57:47,297 --> 00:57:48,766
Support you?

1059
00:57:48,799 --> 00:57:49,700
Both of y'all can get
the hell out of my house.

1060
00:57:49,734 --> 00:57:50,635
Man, y'all, chill for real.

1061
00:57:50,668 --> 00:57:51,902
Get your hands off me, man.

1062
00:57:51,936 --> 00:57:53,704
You know you got problems.

1063
00:57:53,738 --> 00:57:55,139
You deal with that shit.

1064
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,008
Come on, Lexi.

1065
00:57:58,042 --> 00:58:01,145
(tense music)

1066
00:58:01,178 --> 00:58:03,080
What the hell is
wrong with you, bro?

1067
00:58:04,414 --> 00:58:05,315
I'm good.

1068
00:58:09,053 --> 00:58:11,522
Aight, man.

1069
00:58:12,657 --> 00:58:15,159
(tense music)

1070
00:58:32,009 --> 00:58:32,843
Here we go.

1071
00:58:36,413 --> 00:58:37,682
Where is this dude going?

1072
00:58:38,883 --> 00:58:39,984
Are you sure we
should be doing this?

1073
00:58:40,017 --> 00:58:41,485
Relax, we're fine.

1074
00:58:41,518 --> 00:58:43,287
Just keep an eye on him.

1075
00:58:43,320 --> 00:58:45,255
I just don't want
to step on his rights.

1076
00:58:45,289 --> 00:58:46,256
(laughs)

1077
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:48,025
We're good.

1078
00:58:48,058 --> 00:58:49,159
All right.

1079
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:51,528
(tense music)

1080
00:59:38,776 --> 00:59:40,144
What are you doing here, man?

1081
00:59:40,177 --> 00:59:42,780
You sent that
bitch, didn't you?

1082
00:59:42,813 --> 00:59:45,115
[Ethan] What are
you talking about?

1083
00:59:45,149 --> 00:59:47,084
And you fucked my wife.

1084
00:59:54,091 --> 00:59:56,593
(tense music)

1085
00:59:59,163 --> 01:00:00,230
(laughing)

1086
01:00:00,264 --> 01:00:02,366
Man, look at this shit here.

1087
01:00:02,399 --> 01:00:04,101
Now this is interesting.

1088
01:00:04,134 --> 01:00:05,202
Should we help?

1089
01:00:05,235 --> 01:00:06,671
No, they're brothers.

1090
01:00:06,704 --> 01:00:07,337
Let it play out.

1091
01:00:09,539 --> 01:00:10,875
Get off of me.

1092
01:00:14,411 --> 01:00:15,746
You all right?

1093
01:00:18,382 --> 01:00:20,818
Man, look you need to relax
on Mia and I, all right?

1094
01:00:20,851 --> 01:00:21,518
It's complicated

1095
01:00:22,653 --> 01:00:24,054
and whatever you
have towards Alexis,

1096
01:00:24,088 --> 01:00:25,322
you leave her out
of it, all right?

1097
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:26,957
Your girl, Alexis.

1098
01:00:29,526 --> 01:00:30,360
I fucked her.

1099
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:32,697
So I guess we even.

1100
01:00:37,367 --> 01:00:39,804
(tense music)

1101
01:01:20,244 --> 01:01:22,747
(tense music)

1102
01:02:28,813 --> 01:02:31,315
(tense music)

1103
01:03:03,981 --> 01:03:06,984
(eerie tense music)

1104
01:03:15,792 --> 01:03:18,462
(soft thudding)

1105
01:03:37,414 --> 01:03:39,917
(tense music)

1106
01:04:27,998 --> 01:04:30,534
(tense music)

1107
01:04:47,184 --> 01:04:48,752
I'm losing my mind.

1108
01:04:51,188 --> 01:04:53,991
(grunting)

1109
01:04:54,024 --> 01:04:56,360
(eerie music)

1110
01:04:57,594 --> 01:05:00,597
(groaning)

1111
01:05:00,630 --> 01:05:03,500
(eerie tense music)

1112
01:05:19,716 --> 01:05:21,518
You still taste good.

1113
01:05:21,551 --> 01:05:22,219
Why?

1114
01:05:24,321 --> 01:05:25,655
You had everything.

1115
01:05:26,590 --> 01:05:29,059
You had her but she's mine.

1116
01:05:32,262 --> 01:05:35,532
Not your brothers,
not yours but mine.

1117
01:05:37,367 --> 01:05:38,868
Ethan.

1118
01:05:38,902 --> 01:05:39,569
Oh him?

1119
01:05:40,737 --> 01:05:42,406
Don't worry about him.

1120
01:05:42,439 --> 01:05:45,009
You'll see him really soon.

1121
01:05:45,042 --> 01:05:46,576
You killed him?

1122
01:05:46,610 --> 01:05:47,744
Oh me?

1123
01:05:48,578 --> 01:05:50,214
No, not me.

1124
01:05:51,548 --> 01:05:54,551
(eerie tense music)

1125
01:06:07,931 --> 01:06:08,765
Hi, honey.

1126
01:06:10,167 --> 01:06:12,936
(groaning)

1127
01:06:12,969 --> 01:06:17,774
Hi, baby.

1128
01:06:18,375 --> 01:06:18,675
I killed him.

1129
01:06:20,844 --> 01:06:23,213
Slit his throat from ear to ear

1130
01:06:25,915 --> 01:06:28,318
and it was so easy
to get close to him

1131
01:06:28,352 --> 01:06:29,786
because he couldn't control

1132
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,921
what was in between his legs.

1133
01:06:33,057 --> 01:06:35,125
Oh I need you.

1134
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:37,794
Don't leave me, I can
be better than her.

1135
01:06:37,827 --> 01:06:40,297
(mock crying)

1136
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:40,997
Men.

1137
01:06:42,732 --> 01:06:44,834
Why are you doing this?

1138
01:06:45,669 --> 01:06:46,970
Because I can.

1139
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:48,938
I'm dead, remember?

1140
01:06:50,207 --> 01:06:51,575
And you signed power of attorney

1141
01:06:51,608 --> 01:06:52,409
over to Mr. Collin.

1142
01:06:53,643 --> 01:06:54,844
Don't look so shocked.

1143
01:06:56,513 --> 01:06:58,014
[Jacob] All this over money?

1144
01:06:59,216 --> 01:07:00,016
Of course not.

1145
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:04,688
This is about me getting
all that I deserve.

1146
01:07:06,690 --> 01:07:10,227
My own little slice
of heaven, all of it.

1147
01:07:11,495 --> 01:07:12,796
[Jacob] You're crazy.

1148
01:07:12,829 --> 01:07:14,531
(laughs)

1149
01:07:14,564 --> 01:07:15,232
Maybe.

1150
01:07:17,801 --> 01:07:19,403
Kill him so we can go already.

1151
01:07:25,041 --> 01:07:27,277
You go ahead, I'll catch up.

1152
01:07:28,345 --> 01:07:30,380
[Alexis] What?

1153
01:07:30,414 --> 01:07:31,081
Go.

1154
01:07:32,216 --> 01:07:33,049
Go.

1155
01:07:36,653 --> 01:07:38,822
(eerie tense music)

1156
01:07:38,855 --> 01:07:40,957
(wheezing)

1157
01:07:46,763 --> 01:07:47,931
Back to you...

1158
01:07:52,369 --> 01:07:54,070
Jacob?

1159
01:07:54,104 --> 01:07:56,440
(tense music)

1160
01:08:06,783 --> 01:08:09,186
You guys are so predictable.

1161
01:08:12,989 --> 01:08:13,957
A lonely wife.

1162
01:08:15,392 --> 01:08:17,127
The alluring girlfriend.

1163
01:08:20,130 --> 01:08:21,398
The disloyal brother.

1164
01:08:23,967 --> 01:08:26,236
Easy, easy, easy.

1165
01:08:29,506 --> 01:08:33,677
All I had to do was
keep chipping away.

1166
01:08:44,188 --> 01:08:45,889
My life was meant
to be so much more

1167
01:08:45,922 --> 01:08:47,056
than you could give me.

1168
01:09:01,971 --> 01:09:04,441
(tense music)

1169
01:09:09,913 --> 01:09:12,148
(groaning)

1170
01:09:41,911 --> 01:09:44,414
(tense music)

1171
01:10:00,364 --> 01:10:03,367
(eerie tense music)

1172
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:35,064
(energetic tense music)

1173
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,703
(gunshot)

1174
01:10:57,821 --> 01:11:00,457
(tense electronic music)

1175
01:11:00,490 --> 01:11:01,791
I see you recently
made changes

1176
01:11:01,825 --> 01:11:04,160
to your insurance policy
for you and your wife.

1177
01:11:05,595 --> 01:11:07,297
[Mia Voiceover] There's
some paperwork in there

1178
01:11:07,331 --> 01:11:08,732
that still needs your signature.

1179
01:11:08,765 --> 01:11:11,668
Your money has been erratic
for the last year or so.

1180
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:14,371
Yeah.

1181
01:11:14,404 --> 01:11:14,838
[Watts] Is that
your signature?

1182
01:11:17,507 --> 01:11:18,808
I'm scared.

1183
01:11:18,842 --> 01:11:21,678
(eerie tense music)

1184
01:11:29,819 --> 01:11:32,255
[Watts] What you picked up.

1185
01:11:33,857 --> 01:11:34,991
Is that your signature?

1186
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:37,927
It's my job.

1187
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:39,729
That's why I worry.

1188
01:11:39,763 --> 01:11:42,599
(eerie tense music)

1189
01:11:46,202 --> 01:11:47,303
(gasping)

1190
01:11:47,337 --> 01:11:49,339
Jacob, Jacob calm down, bro.

1191
01:11:49,373 --> 01:11:50,173
I'm right here.

1192
01:11:50,206 --> 01:11:51,040
You're good.

1193
01:11:52,676 --> 01:11:54,077
How long was I out?

1194
01:11:54,110 --> 01:11:55,144
Like 10 days.

1195
01:11:57,447 --> 01:11:58,247
And E?

1196
01:12:00,016 --> 01:12:01,017
He didn't make it.

1197
01:12:01,885 --> 01:12:03,286
Oh Jesus.

1198
01:12:03,319 --> 01:12:07,290
That Alexis chick,
she went psycho man.

1199
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:08,858
She cut his throat

1200
01:12:08,892 --> 01:12:10,293
and then she came after you.

1201
01:12:11,495 --> 01:12:13,262
What about Mia?

1202
01:12:13,296 --> 01:12:15,264
Mia, what do you
mean, what about her?

1203
01:12:16,566 --> 01:12:18,334
Mr. Patterson.

1204
01:12:18,368 --> 01:12:21,405
Glad to see you join us
in the land of the living.

1205
01:12:21,438 --> 01:12:23,072
Yeah.

1206
01:12:23,106 --> 01:12:25,475
Detectives, how
can we help you?

1207
01:12:25,509 --> 01:12:27,977
Just following up
on those anomalies.

1208
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:29,413
And?

1209
01:12:29,446 --> 01:12:30,880
And the reason we brought
you in, Mr. Patterson,

1210
01:12:30,914 --> 01:12:32,382
was because we thought
you were being targeted

1211
01:12:32,416 --> 01:12:34,017
for some sort of scam

1212
01:12:34,050 --> 01:12:36,920
and it turns out our
suspicions were spot on.

1213
01:12:36,953 --> 01:12:38,354
Your wife and this gentleman.

1214
01:12:44,227 --> 01:12:45,962
The lawyer.

1215
01:12:45,995 --> 01:12:47,397
He and Mia were actually
brother and sister.

1216
01:12:47,431 --> 01:12:49,365
Donna and Kevin Paradise.

1217
01:12:49,399 --> 01:12:51,367
Her brother's IQ
is off the charts,

1218
01:12:51,401 --> 01:12:54,270
bio-chemist, borderline genius.

1219
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:55,304
Meaning he's fully capable

1220
01:12:55,338 --> 01:12:56,573
of coming up with a concoction

1221
01:12:56,606 --> 01:12:58,442
to slow a heart rate
to resemble death.

1222
01:13:00,544 --> 01:13:02,045
So she never died?

1223
01:13:02,078 --> 01:13:03,513
[Watts] Nope.

1224
01:13:03,547 --> 01:13:06,583
[Sykes] How well did you
know your wife, Mr. Patterson?

1225
01:13:06,616 --> 01:13:08,518
Well I didn't
dig into her past

1226
01:13:08,552 --> 01:13:09,819
or anything like that.

1227
01:13:09,853 --> 01:13:11,488
They like to
play the long game,

1228
01:13:11,521 --> 01:13:14,057
get in, find the
money, the properties,

1229
01:13:14,090 --> 01:13:16,660
create the avenue
and exploit it.

1230
01:13:16,693 --> 01:13:18,061
[Jacob] Wow.

1231
01:13:18,094 --> 01:13:19,563
And you and your
brother were the targets.

1232
01:13:19,596 --> 01:13:22,466
They take over lives,
then move on, start again.

1233
01:13:22,499 --> 01:13:25,034
Some sort of sick,
twisted game to them.

1234
01:13:25,068 --> 01:13:26,302
We can probably
trace this back

1235
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:28,071
to six other cases like yours.

1236
01:13:28,104 --> 01:13:29,138
All across the US.

1237
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:34,277
That's some Invasion of
the Body snatchers type shit.

1238
01:13:34,310 --> 01:13:35,479
You got lucky.

1239
01:13:35,512 --> 01:13:37,113
More than likely
because of the girl.

1240
01:13:39,683 --> 01:13:41,250
Dana Jordan.

1241
01:13:41,284 --> 01:13:43,386
She was the newbie they
hired to get to you and Ethan

1242
01:13:43,419 --> 01:13:46,823
and when she couldn't do
the job, she was expendable.

1243
01:13:46,856 --> 01:13:47,624
Alexis.

1244
01:13:49,325 --> 01:13:50,827
What about Mia?

1245
01:13:50,860 --> 01:13:52,496
[Watts] She disappeared,
her brother, too

1246
01:13:52,529 --> 01:13:53,763
but if it means anything,

1247
01:13:53,797 --> 01:13:55,131
we're not letting this one go.

1248
01:13:55,999 --> 01:13:57,400
I appreciate it.

1249
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:58,434
Take care of yourself.

1250
01:14:05,008 --> 01:14:07,010
Damn, bro, that's crazy.

1251
01:14:07,043 --> 01:14:08,978
Like something straight
up out of a movie.

1252
01:14:10,514 --> 01:14:12,916
Got me second guessing
trusting these women now.

1253
01:14:14,417 --> 01:14:16,385
Like for real.

1254
01:14:16,419 --> 01:14:19,122
Alice might have
to get the rundown.

1255
01:14:19,155 --> 01:14:21,691
(laughing)

1256
01:14:21,725 --> 01:14:22,792
For real, bro.

1257
01:14:22,826 --> 01:14:23,760
Don't make me laugh.

1258
01:14:25,094 --> 01:14:25,929
Oh man.

1259
01:14:30,600 --> 01:14:33,603
[Dr. Connors] So, what's
next for you, Mr. Patterson?

1260
01:14:35,639 --> 01:14:36,606
Some time off.

1261
01:14:37,941 --> 01:14:41,678
Maybe a trip to paradise.

1262
01:15:33,229 --> 01:15:36,232
