1
00:00:51,994 --> 00:00:53,675
Do you ever look at
someone and wonder

2
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:56,468
What is going on
inside their head?

3
00:00:56,493 --> 00:00:58,136
Well, I know.

4
00:00:58,161 --> 00:01:00,706
Well, I know Riley's head.

5
00:01:44,588 --> 00:01:47,343
And there she was!

6
00:01:48,551 --> 00:01:50,504
Hello!

7
00:01:51,455 --> 00:01:54,923
- Riley.
- Whoa. Look at you.

8
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,876
Aren't you a little bundle of joy.

9
00:02:07,700 --> 00:02:09,700
[ Memory ] Aren't you a little bundle of joy.

10
00:02:10,844 --> 00:02:13,190
Whoa.

11
00:02:30,253 --> 00:02:33,948
It was amazing!
Just Riley and me,

12
00:02:33,973 --> 00:02:36,379
forever.

13
00:02:39,703 --> 00:02:41,503
<i>( Crying )</i>

14
00:02:41,538 --> 00:02:42,779
Or for...

15
00:02:42,804 --> 00:02:45,059
33 seconds.

16
00:02:46,012 --> 00:02:47,728
I'm Sadness.

17
00:02:47,753 --> 00:02:51,519
Oh, hello.
I'm Joy...so...

18
00:02:51,703 --> 00:02:53,271
Can I just,
if you could...

19
00:02:53,296 --> 00:02:55,591
I don't know, let me fix that.
Thanks.

20
00:02:55,616 --> 00:02:57,467
And that was just the beginning.

21
00:02:57,492 --> 00:03:00,554
Headquarters only got
more crowded from there.

22
00:03:02,241 --> 00:03:04,704
Very nice. Okay.
Looks like you got this.

23
00:03:04,729 --> 00:03:06,019
Very good.
Oh. Sharp! Sharp!

24
00:03:06,044 --> 00:03:07,050
NO, LOOK OUT!!!

25
00:03:07,075 --> 00:03:10,836
That's Fear.
He's really good at keeping Riley safe.

26
00:03:10,867 --> 00:03:12,113
Easy. Easy.

27
00:03:12,138 --> 00:03:13,585
Fall back!
Oh, we're good.

28
00:03:13,610 --> 00:03:15,155
We're good.

29
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:16,702
- Woo. Good job.
- Thank you. Thank you very much.

30
00:03:16,727 --> 00:03:18,280
And we're back.

31
00:03:19,432 --> 00:03:20,857
Whoa.

32
00:03:22,643 --> 00:03:24,435
Here we go, alright.
Open.

33
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:26,133
- Hm. This looks new.
- Think it's safe?

34
00:03:26,158 --> 00:03:27,468
- What is it?
- Ah...

35
00:03:27,493 --> 00:03:30,157
Okay, caution.
There is a dangerous smell people.

36
00:03:30,182 --> 00:03:31,255
Hold on.
What is that?

37
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:32,488
This is Disgust.

38
00:03:32,513 --> 00:03:34,897
She basically keeps Riley from being poisoned,

39
00:03:34,922 --> 00:03:36,230
physically and socially.

40
00:03:36,255 --> 00:03:37,763
That is not brightly colored.

41
00:03:37,788 --> 00:03:39,587
Or shaped like a dinosaur.
Hold on guys.

42
00:03:39,612 --> 00:03:41,102
It's broccoli!
Blah!

43
00:03:41,127 --> 00:03:42,571
Yuck!

44
00:03:43,907 --> 00:03:45,737
Well, I just saved our lives.

45
00:03:45,762 --> 00:03:46,815
Yeah, you're welcome.

46
00:03:46,847 --> 00:03:49,656
Riley, if you don't eat your dinner,
you're not going to get any dessert.

47
00:03:49,681 --> 00:03:52,006
Wait. Did he just say
we couldn't have dessert?

48
00:03:52,031 --> 00:03:53,562
That's Anger. He...

49
00:03:53,587 --> 00:03:56,459
cares very deeply about
things being fair.

50
00:03:56,484 --> 00:03:58,358
So, that's how you
want to play it, old man?

51
00:03:58,383 --> 00:04:01,440
No dessert!? Oh, sure!
We'll eat our dinner!

52
00:04:01,485 --> 00:04:03,678
Right after you
eat this!

53
00:04:03,703 --> 00:04:05,570
AHHH!!!

54
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:10,300
Riley, Riley.
Here comes the airplane.

55
00:04:10,945 --> 00:04:13,228
Oh, airplane.
We got an airplane, everybody.

56
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:15,083
<i>( All Ooo-ing )</i>

57
00:04:23,355 --> 00:04:25,071
And you've met Sadness.

58
00:04:25,096 --> 00:04:27,258
She...Well...she...

59
00:04:27,382 --> 00:04:30,482
<i>( Crying )</i>

60
00:04:31,219 --> 00:04:33,049
I'm not actually
sure what she does.

61
00:04:33,074 --> 00:04:35,713
And I've checked,
There's no place for her to go...So...

62
00:04:35,758 --> 00:04:38,854
She's good. We're good.
It's all great.

63
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,843
Anyway, these are Riley's memories.

64
00:04:40,868 --> 00:04:42,557
And they are mostly
happy you'll notice.

65
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:43,644
Not to brag.

66
00:04:48,738 --> 00:04:51,163
But the really important
ones are over here.

67
00:04:51,188 --> 00:04:53,332
I don't want to get too technical
but these are called

68
00:04:53,357 --> 00:04:55,011
Core Memories.

69
00:04:55,036 --> 00:04:58,587
Each one came from a super
important time in Riley's life.

70
00:04:58,612 --> 00:05:01,846
Like when she first scored a goal.
It was so amazing!

71
00:05:01,871 --> 00:05:03,566
Hey hey!
Would you look at that.

72
00:05:03,591 --> 00:05:05,188
Very nice.

73
00:05:05,765 --> 00:05:08,102
<i> ( All cheering )</i>

74
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:22,869
And each Core Memory powers
a different aspect of Riley's personality.

75
00:05:22,894 --> 00:05:25,244
Like Hockey Island.

76
00:05:27,130 --> 00:05:30,022
Goofball Island
is my personal favorite.

77
00:05:30,299 --> 00:05:32,889
Come back here,
you little monkey!

78
00:05:34,850 --> 00:05:37,424
Yup, Goofball is the best.

79
00:05:37,449 --> 00:05:40,223
Friendship Island is pretty good too.

80
00:05:41,735 --> 00:05:44,484
Oh, I love Honesty Island!

81
00:05:44,509 --> 00:05:45,945
And that's the truth.

82
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,801
And of course,
Family Island is amazing.

83
00:05:50,276 --> 00:05:55,094
The point is: The islands of personality
are what make Riley, Riley.

84
00:05:55,119 --> 00:05:57,551
Look out,
Blue face!

85
00:06:03,149 --> 00:06:05,656
Lava!
Hoo!

86

Bing-Bong. Bing-Bong. ♫

87
00:06:10,766 --> 00:06:13,226

88
00:06:16,839 --> 00:06:18,787
- Agh.

89

We're out.

95

That's what I'm talking about.

96

Woo! Another perfect day.

97

Nice job everybody.

98
00:06:45,428 --> 00:06:48,070
Let's get those memories
down to long term.

99
00:06:52,414 --> 00:06:54,098
Alright, we did not die today.

100
00:06:54,123 --> 00:06:57,009
I call that an
unqualified success.

101
00:07:11,856 --> 00:07:14,203
And, that's it.
We love our girl.

102
00:07:14,228 --> 00:07:16,775
She's got great friends
and a great house.

103
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:18,748
Things couldn't be better.

104
00:07:18,773 --> 00:07:21,523
After all.
Riley is 11 now.

105
00:07:21,548 --> 00:07:23,164
What could happen?

106
00:07:24,249 --> 00:07:25,644
- What?
- Ahhh!

107
00:07:25,669 --> 00:07:27,996
- Huh?
- Ahhh!

108
00:07:30,004 --> 00:07:32,216
Okay...Not what I had in mind.

109
00:07:32,241 --> 00:07:33,655
Ahhh!

110
00:07:56,607 --> 00:07:59,818
Hey, look. The Golden Gate Bridge!
Isn't that great?

111
00:07:59,852 --> 00:08:04,391
It's not made up of solid gold like we thought,
which is kind of disappointed. But still...

112
00:08:04,416 --> 00:08:06,796
I sure am glad you told me
earthquakes are a myth, Joy.

113
00:08:06,821 --> 00:08:11,134
- Otherwise I be terrified right now.
- Uhh...Yeah.

114
00:08:13,248 --> 00:08:15,609
These are my kind of people.

115
00:08:15,634 --> 00:08:17,030
Alright, just a few more blocks.

116
00:08:17,055 --> 00:08:19,330
- We're almost to our new house.
- Step on it, Daddy.

117
00:08:19,355 --> 00:08:22,525
Why can't we just live in this smelly car.
We're already been in it forever.

118
00:08:22,550 --> 00:08:24,425
Which...actually was really lucky.

119
00:08:24,450 --> 00:08:28,270
Because that gave us plenty of time to think
about what our new house is going to look like.

120
00:08:28,295 --> 00:08:31,162
What!? Let's review
the top five daydreams.

121
00:08:31,187 --> 00:08:33,002
- Ooo, that looks safe.
- That looks nice.

122
00:08:33,027 --> 00:08:35,637
Ooo. This will be great for Riley.
Oh! No, no, no... this one.

123
00:08:35,662 --> 00:08:37,937
Joy for the last time:
She cannot live in a cookie.

124
00:08:37,962 --> 00:08:40,894
That's the one!
It comes with a dragon!

125
00:08:41,675 --> 00:08:44,002
Are we getting close?
I can feel it.

126
00:08:44,623 --> 00:08:46,854
Here it is.
Here's our new house.

127
00:08:46,879 --> 00:08:48,781
And...

128
00:08:54,141 --> 00:08:57,168
Maybe, it's nice on the inside.

129
00:09:01,542 --> 00:09:03,643
- We're suppose to live here?
- Do we have to?

130
00:09:03,668 --> 00:09:05,785
I'm telling you, it smells
that something died in here.

131
00:09:05,810 --> 00:09:08,544
- Can you die from moving?
- Guys, you are overreacting.

132
00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:11,092
- Nobody is dying.
- A dead mouse!

133
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:12,336
- Great.
- I'm gonna be sick.

134
00:09:12,361 --> 00:09:13,272
It's a house of the dead.
What're we gonna do?

135
00:09:13,297 --> 00:09:15,825
- We're gonna get rabies.
- Get off from me!

136
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:17,371
Hey, hey, hey.
All through the drive,

137
00:09:17,396 --> 00:09:19,681
Dad talked about how cool
our new room is.

138
00:09:19,705 --> 00:09:21,648
- Let's go check it out.
- It's gonna be great!

139
00:09:21,673 --> 00:09:22,911
Yes, yes, yes...

140
00:09:22,936 --> 00:09:25,241
- No, no, no...
- I'm starting to envy the dead mouse.

141
00:09:25,266 --> 00:09:27,679
Get out the rubber ball.
We're in solitary confinement.

142
00:09:27,717 --> 00:09:29,628
- Riley can't live here.
- She's right.

143
00:09:29,653 --> 00:09:31,200
- Really bad.
- It's absolutely the worst.

144
00:09:31,225 --> 00:09:32,419
- This house stinks.
- It's the worst place

145
00:09:32,444 --> 00:09:34,029
- ... I've been in my entire life.
- Oh, yeah.

146
00:09:34,054 --> 00:09:36,565
Hey, it's nothing our
butterfly curtains couldn't fix.

147
00:09:36,590 --> 00:09:38,972
I read somewhere that an
empty room is an opportunity.

148
00:09:38,997 --> 00:09:39,805
Where did you read that?

149
00:09:39,830 --> 00:09:41,488
It doesn't matter. I
read it and it's great.

150
00:09:41,513 --> 00:09:43,832
We'll put the bed there.
And the desk over there.

151
00:09:43,857 --> 00:09:45,174
The hockey lamp goes there.

152
00:09:45,199 --> 00:09:47,459
- Put the chair there.
- Oh, the trophy collections.

153
00:09:47,484 --> 00:09:48,864
- There...
- Stars!

154
00:09:48,889 --> 00:09:50,619
- I like that.
- Now, we're talking!

155
00:09:50,644 --> 00:09:52,855
Let's go get our stuff
from the moving van.

156
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:55,292
Alright. Goodbye.
Well, guess what?

157
00:09:55,317 --> 00:09:57,248
The moving van won't
be here until next Thursday.

158
00:09:57,273 --> 00:09:58,751
You're kidding?

159
00:09:58,868 --> 00:10:02,071
Our van is lost?
It's the worst day ever.

160
00:10:02,872 --> 00:10:05,139
- You said it would be here yesterday.
- And I know that's what I said.

161
00:10:05,164 --> 00:10:06,800
- That's what they told me.
- Mom and Dad are stressed out.

162
00:10:06,825 --> 00:10:08,908
- They are stress out.
- Arguing.
- What're we going to do.

163
00:10:09,987 --> 00:10:12,260
I've got a great idea!

164
00:10:12,285 --> 00:10:14,132
Did you even read the contract?

165
00:10:14,157 --> 00:10:16,537
Anderson makes her move.
She's closing in.

166
00:10:16,562 --> 00:10:18,889
Hey.
Oh no, you're not.

167
00:10:18,914 --> 00:10:21,437
- She's running for the shot.
- Coming behind you, watch out.

168
00:10:21,462 --> 00:10:23,643
And she scores!
Yeah!

169
00:10:23,674 --> 00:10:25,578
- Woo-hoo.
- Yo-ho.

170
00:10:25,603 --> 00:10:27,206
Come on, Grandma.

171
00:10:27,231 --> 00:10:28,747
Ha. Grandma?

172
00:10:28,772 --> 00:10:31,589
Oh-oh, she put her hair up.
We're in for it!

173
00:10:32,229 --> 00:10:35,399
Heyyy.
Put me down.

174
00:10:35,653 --> 00:10:37,052
- Eh-heh-heh.
- Ha-ha.

175
00:10:38,918 --> 00:10:40,574
Sorry, hold on.

176
00:10:41,626 --> 00:10:43,523
- Hello.
- Wait. What.

177
00:10:43,548 --> 00:10:45,133
You're kidding.

178
00:10:45,772 --> 00:10:48,433
Alright. Stall for me,
I'll be right there.

179
00:10:48,458 --> 00:10:51,441
The investors are suppose to
show up on Thursday, not today.

180
00:10:51,658 --> 00:10:54,311
- I got to go.
- It's okay, we get it.

181
00:10:54,336 --> 00:10:58,003
You're the best. Thanks hon.
See you, sweetie.

182
00:10:58,582 --> 00:10:59,911
Dad just left us.

183
00:10:59,936 --> 00:11:03,087
Oh, he doesn't love us anymore.
That's sad.

184
00:11:03,112 --> 00:11:04,984
I-I should drive, right?

185
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:08,446
Joy. What are you doing?

186
00:11:08,471 --> 00:11:10,810
Just...uhh...give me one second.

187
00:11:10,835 --> 00:11:12,771
You know what I've realised?

188
00:11:12,796 --> 00:11:14,433
Riley hasn't had lunch.

189
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:15,240
Remember?

190
00:11:16,892 --> 00:11:20,549
Hey, I saw a pizza place down the street.
Maybe we can try that?

191
00:11:20,579 --> 00:11:22,543
- Pizza sounds delicious.
- Pizza!

192
00:11:22,574 --> 00:11:24,762
- Yes, pizza!
- Pizza. Great idea. Let's get it.

193
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,567
- What the heck is that!?
- Who puts broccoli on pizza?

194
00:11:28,592 --> 00:11:29,698
That's it. I'm done.

195
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:33,014
Congratulation San Francisco.
You've ruined pizza!

196
00:11:33,043 --> 00:11:36,727
First the Hawaiians.
And now you.

197
00:11:36,752 --> 00:11:39,672
What kind of a pizza place
only serves one kind of pizza?

198
00:11:39,697 --> 00:11:42,251
Must be a San Francisco thing.

199
00:11:42,276 --> 00:11:45,099
Still, it's not as bad as the soup
at that diner in Nebraska.

200
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:49,519
Oh, yeah. The spoon stood up
in the soup by itself.

201
00:11:49,725 --> 00:11:52,560
We're good.
Family's running.

202
00:11:52,727 --> 00:11:55,983
The drive out was pretty fun.
What was your favorite part?

203
00:11:56,008 --> 00:11:57,470
Spitting out of the car window!

204
00:11:57,495 --> 00:12:00,170
- Definitely not when Dad was singing.
- Wearing a seat belt.

205
00:12:00,199 --> 00:12:02,428
Oh. What about the time
with the dinosaur.

206
00:12:02,453 --> 00:12:04,134
- Oh, that's the one.
- That was great.

207
00:12:04,159 --> 00:12:05,393
Say cheese.

208
00:12:05,418 --> 00:12:07,126
- Dad. Dad. Dad.
- Honey.

209
00:12:07,151 --> 00:12:08,944
 Dad, look at the car.
Just look behind you.

210
00:12:08,969 --> 00:12:10,991
No-no-no...

211
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,815
No!
Aw.

212
00:12:12,840 --> 00:12:13,826
Nice one, Joy.

213
00:12:13,851 --> 00:12:17,262
I like that time with the dinosaur.
That was pretty funny.

214
00:12:24,078 --> 00:12:26,523
Wait, what.
What happened?

215
00:12:27,346 --> 00:12:29,782
She did something to the memory.

216
00:12:29,939 --> 00:12:32,474
- What did you do?
- I- I just touched it.

217
00:12:32,499 --> 00:12:34,356
- That shouldn't make it change.
- Oh. Change it back, Joy.

218
00:12:34,381 --> 00:12:35,641
- I'm trying.
- You can't change it back?

219
00:12:35,666 --> 00:12:37,668
- No. I guess I can't.
- Good going, Sadness.

220
00:12:37,693 --> 00:12:41,308
Now when Riley thinks of that moment with Dad,
she's gonna feel sad. Bravo.

221
00:12:41,341 --> 00:12:47,023
I'm sorry, Joy. I don't really know.
I thought maybe if you, if you, I mean...

222
00:12:47,052 --> 00:12:50,000
Joy, we've got a stairway coming up.

223
00:12:51,177 --> 00:12:54,163
Just don't touch any other memories
until we figured out what's going on.

224
00:12:54,188 --> 00:12:55,450
- Okay.
- Alright.

225
00:12:55,475 --> 00:13:00,918
Get ready. This is the monster railing
and we are riding it all the way down.

226
00:13:06,991 --> 00:13:09,250
Wait, what?
What happened?

227
00:13:10,280 --> 00:13:12,472
- A Core Memory!
- Oh no!

228
00:13:15,333 --> 00:13:17,481
- Sadness, what're you doing?
- It looked like one was crooked

229
00:13:17,506 --> 00:13:20,881
So I opened it and it fell out.
I.

230
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:26,511
Woo-hoo!

231
00:13:26,544 --> 00:13:29,656
It's just that. I want to,
maybe, hold one.

232
00:13:29,681 --> 00:13:31,839
- Joy!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

233
00:13:32,823 --> 00:13:35,133
Sadness. You nearly
touch a Core Memory.

234
00:13:35,158 --> 00:13:37,370
And when you touch them,
we can't change them back.

235
00:13:37,395 --> 00:13:40,457
Oh, I know. I'm sorry.
Something's wrong with me.

236
00:13:40,482 --> 00:13:42,853
I... It's like
I'm having a break down.

237
00:13:42,878 --> 00:13:44,770
You're not having a break down.
It's stress.

238
00:13:44,795 --> 00:13:47,733
I keep making mistakes like that.
I'm awful.

239
00:13:47,758 --> 00:13:49,784
- Oh, you're not.
- And annoying.

240
00:13:49,813 --> 00:13:51,882
They, well...
You know what.

241
00:13:51,907 --> 00:13:53,850
You can't focus on
what's going wrong.

242
00:13:53,888 --> 00:13:55,608
There's always a way
to turn things around

243
00:13:55,633 --> 00:13:57,341
To find the fun.

244
00:13:57,366 --> 00:14:00,770
Yeah, find the fun.
I don't know how to do that.

245
00:14:00,795 --> 00:14:04,739
Okay, well.
Try to think of something funny.

246
00:14:04,847 --> 00:14:08,227
Oh. Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies?

247
00:14:08,252 --> 00:14:10,279
Oh, yeah.
That's not...

248
00:14:10,304 --> 00:14:11,834
What about that time, with Meg.

249
00:14:11,859 --> 00:14:16,979
When Riley laughed so hard,
milk came out of her nose.

250
00:14:17,004 --> 00:14:18,098
Come on.

251
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:21,206
Yeah, that hurt.
It felt like fire.

252
00:14:21,231 --> 00:14:22,703
- It was awf...
- Okay, okay.

253
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,670
Don't think of that.
Let's try something else.

254
00:14:24,695 --> 00:14:28,129
- What're your favorite things to do?
- My favorite?

255
00:14:28,172 --> 00:14:29,910
Well, I like it
when we're outside.

256
00:14:29,936 --> 00:14:33,126
That's good! Like, there's
the beach and sunshine.

257
00:14:33,151 --> 00:14:36,128
Oh. Like the time we buried
Dad in the sand up to his neck.

258
00:14:36,153 --> 00:14:39,267
I was thinking more like rain.

259
00:14:39,795 --> 00:14:43,024
Rain...Rain is my favorite too!

260
00:14:43,049 --> 00:14:44,723
We can stomp around the puddles

261
00:14:44,748 --> 00:14:48,232
You know?
There's cool umbrellas, lightning storms.

262
00:14:48,257 --> 00:14:52,340
More like when the rain runs down our
back and that makes our shoes soggy.

263
00:14:52,365 --> 00:14:58,089
And we get all cold, shivery and
everything starts feeling droopy.

264
00:14:58,114 --> 00:15:00,425
Oh. Hey, hey, hey.
Easy.

265
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:02,654
Why are you crying?

266
00:15:02,679 --> 00:15:06,145
It's... It's really the opposite
of what we're going for here.

267
00:15:06,170 --> 00:15:11,640
Crying helps me slow down and obsessive
over the weight of life's problems.

268
00:15:11,665 --> 00:15:14,591
You know what?
Let's think about something else.

269
00:15:14,616 --> 00:15:18,141
How about we read some mind manuals?
Huh? Sounds fun.

270
00:15:18,166 --> 00:15:19,489
I've read most of them.

271
00:15:19,514 --> 00:15:21,467
Well, have you read this one?
This seems interesting.

272
00:15:21,492 --> 00:15:24,730
Long term memory retrieval.
Volume 47.

273
00:15:24,755 --> 00:15:27,228
- No.
- Woo. A real page turner.

274
00:15:27,253 --> 00:15:31,247
Long term memory data selection
via channel subgrouping?

275
00:15:31,272 --> 00:15:33,550
See? Fun already!
Oh, you lucky dog.

276
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:38,495
You're reading these cool things,
I got to go work. Life is so unfair.

277
00:15:44,071 --> 00:15:46,031
Ugh.

278
00:15:46,466 --> 00:15:50,288
What can we do? We only got
capital that'll last a month maybe two.

279
00:15:50,313 --> 00:15:53,750
If we can't find investors by then,
we're gonna have to lay people off.

280
00:15:53,775 --> 00:15:57,000
Mom. Dad.
Come kiss me good night.

281
00:15:57,025 --> 00:16:01,072
- I know. I know. We got to land this, okay.
- Be right there.

282
00:16:02,796 --> 00:16:06,259
Did you hear Dad?
He sounded really upset.

283
00:16:08,505 --> 00:16:10,405
What was that? Was it a bear?
It's a bear!

284
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:12,065
There are no bears
in San Francisco.

285
00:16:12,090 --> 00:16:14,189
I saw a really hairy guy.
He looked like a bear.

286
00:16:14,214 --> 00:16:16,393
Oh. I'm so jumpy, my
nerves are shocked.

287
00:16:16,418 --> 00:16:18,070
Ew.. I don't wanna
hear about your nerves.

288
00:16:18,095 --> 00:16:20,767
I'll tell you what it is.
This move has been a bust.

289
00:16:20,792 --> 00:16:22,389
That's what I've been
telling you guys.

290
00:16:22,414 --> 00:16:24,768
There're at least 37 things for
Riley to be scared of right now.

291
00:16:24,793 --> 00:16:26,435
This smell alone is enough
to make her gag.

292
00:16:26,460 --> 00:16:28,413
I can't believe Mom and
Dad moved us here.

293
00:16:28,438 --> 00:16:30,866
Look. I get it.
You guys have concerns.

294
00:16:30,891 --> 00:16:32,326
But we've been through worst.

295
00:16:32,352 --> 00:16:36,345
Tell you what. Let's make a list of all
the things Riley should be happy about.

296
00:16:36,370 --> 00:16:38,956
Fine. Let's see...
This house stinks. Our room stinks.

297
00:16:38,981 --> 00:16:40,966
- Pizza is weird here.
- Our friends are back home.

298
00:16:40,991 --> 00:16:43,206
And all our stuff
is in the missing van.

299
00:16:43,231 --> 00:16:44,687
Oh, come on.
It could be worse.

300
00:16:44,712 --> 00:16:48,256
Yeah, Joy. We could be lying
on a dirty floor. In a bag.

301
00:16:48,281 --> 00:16:50,375
Okay, I admit it.
We had a rough start.

302
00:16:50,400 --> 00:16:52,415
- But think of all the good things that...
- No, Joy.

303
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,681
There is absolutely no reason
for Riley to be happy right now.

304
00:16:55,706 --> 00:16:56,698
Let us handle this.

305
00:16:56,723 --> 00:16:59,329
I say we skip school tomorrow and
lock ourselves in the bedroom.

306
00:16:59,354 --> 00:17:01,034
We have no clean clothes.
No one should see us.

307
00:17:01,059 --> 00:17:02,841
And we could cry until we can't breathe.

308
00:17:02,866 --> 00:17:05,620
We should lock the door and
scream the curse word we know!

309
00:17:05,645 --> 00:17:07,555
- It's a good one!
- Now, hold on.

310
00:17:07,580 --> 00:17:10,533
Look. We all have our off days.
You know...

311
00:17:10,558 --> 00:17:11,594
Hi honey.

312
00:17:11,619 --> 00:17:15,641
The Mom Bad News Train is pulling in.
Toot-toot!

313
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:17,695
Still no moving van.
Uh-huh.

314
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:20,389
Now they're saying it won't be here till Tuesday.
Can you believe it.

315
00:17:20,414 --> 00:17:21,656
Toot-toot-toot!

316
00:17:21,681 --> 00:17:23,741
- Where's Dad?
- On the phone.

317
00:17:23,766 --> 00:17:25,709
This new venture is
keeping him pretty busy.

318
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:28,482
I rest my case.

319
00:17:31,157 --> 00:17:34,886
Now, for a few well place
withering scowls.

320
00:17:35,166 --> 00:17:37,906
I guess all I really
want to say is

321
00:17:37,937 --> 00:17:39,284
thank you.

322
00:17:39,309 --> 00:17:43,735
You know. Through all
the confusion you've stayed...

323
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:46,627
Well, you've stayed our happy girl.

324
00:17:46,700 --> 00:17:48,811
Your Dad is under
a lot of pressure.

325
00:17:48,836 --> 00:17:53,137
But, if you and I can keep smiling,
it would be a big help.

326
00:17:53,162 --> 00:17:56,439
We can do that for him.
Right?

327
00:17:56,469 --> 00:17:58,120
Whoa.

328
00:17:58,472 --> 00:17:59,976
Well...

329
00:18:01,195 --> 00:18:03,159
Yeah.
Sure.

330
00:18:03,184 --> 00:18:05,892
What did we do
to deserve you?

331
00:18:08,891 --> 00:18:11,383
- Sweet dreams.
- Good night.

332
00:18:12,025 --> 00:18:13,669
Well, you can't argue with Mom.

333
00:18:13,694 --> 00:18:14,853
- Happy it is.
- Can't argue with Mom, that's true.

334
00:18:14,878 --> 00:18:17,537
- Team Happy. Sounds great.
- Totally behind you, Joy.

335
00:18:18,294 --> 00:18:20,057
Looks like we're
going into R.E.M.

336
00:18:20,082 --> 00:18:23,093
I've got dream duty so I'll take care
of sending these to long term.

337
00:18:23,124 --> 00:18:27,608
Great day today, guys!
All is well, team Happy!

338
00:18:28,524 --> 00:18:31,712
Alright.
What's on tonight, dream production?

339
00:18:36,742 --> 00:18:39,345
Now, this is it.
The new place.

340
00:18:41,732 --> 00:18:44,613
Come live with me, Riley.

341
00:18:44,638 --> 00:18:49,440
- Somebody ordered a broccoli pizza.
- Eat me! I'm organic!

342
00:18:50,252 --> 00:18:53,261
Now, who is in charge of
programming down there?

343
00:18:53,286 --> 00:18:56,384
I know I'm not suppose to do this...But...

344
00:19:00,462 --> 00:19:03,527
We are not going to
end the day like this.

345
00:19:46,515 --> 00:19:48,165
Don't you worry.

346
00:19:48,190 --> 00:19:52,249
I'm going to make sure that
tomorrow is another great day.

347
00:19:52,274 --> 00:19:54,431
I promise.

348
00:20:06,571 --> 00:20:09,142
- Hello! Did I wake you?
- Do you have to play that?

349
00:20:09,167 --> 00:20:10,441
Well, I have to practice.

350
00:20:10,466 --> 00:20:13,889
And I don't think of it as playing,
so much as hugging.

351
00:20:13,914 --> 00:20:16,776
Okay. First day of school.
Very, very exciting!

352
00:20:16,801 --> 00:20:19,601
I was up late last night figuring out
a new plan. Here it is!

353
00:20:19,626 --> 00:20:20,853
Fear. I need a list.

354
00:20:20,878 --> 00:20:24,171
of all the possible negative outcomes
on the first day at a new school.

355
00:20:24,196 --> 00:20:26,824
Way ahead of you there.
Does anyone know how to spell "meteor?"

356
00:20:26,849 --> 00:20:28,760
Disgust.
Make sure Riley stands out today.

357
00:20:28,785 --> 00:20:29,819
But, also blends in.

358
00:20:29,856 --> 00:20:31,786
When I'm through, Riley will
look so good,

359
00:20:31,811 --> 00:20:34,019
the other kids will look at
their own outfits and fart.

360
00:20:34,044 --> 00:20:36,646
Joy! Yes, Joy.
You'll be in charge of the console.

361
00:20:36,671 --> 00:20:38,093
Keeping Riley happy
all day long.

362
00:20:38,118 --> 00:20:39,823
And may I add, I love your dress,
it's adorable.

363
00:20:39,848 --> 00:20:43,242
Oh, this old thing. Thank you so much.
I love the way it twirls.

364
00:20:43,724 --> 00:20:46,140
Train of Thought!
Right on schedule!

365
00:20:47,643 --> 00:20:49,573
Anger.
Unload the daydreams.

366
00:20:49,598 --> 00:20:51,847
I ordered extra,
in case things get slow in class.

367
00:20:51,872 --> 00:20:55,163
Might come in handy. If this new school
is full of boring, useless classes.

368
00:20:55,188 --> 00:20:56,849
Which it probably will be.

369
00:20:56,880 --> 00:21:00,629
Oh, Sadness. I've a super
important job just for you.

370
00:21:00,654 --> 00:21:03,312
- Really?
- Uh-huh. Follow me.

371
00:21:04,797 --> 00:21:07,352
- What are you doing?
- And there. Perfect.

372
00:21:07,377 --> 00:21:09,472
This is the circle of sadness.

373
00:21:09,497 --> 00:21:14,064
Your job is to make sure that
all the sadness stays inside of it.

374
00:21:14,089 --> 00:21:16,727
So, you want me
just to stand here?

375
00:21:16,752 --> 00:21:19,721
Hey, it's not my place to
tell you how to do your job.

376
00:21:19,746 --> 00:21:21,085
Just make sure that

377
00:21:21,116 --> 00:21:24,603
all... the sadness
stays in the circle.

378
00:21:24,628 --> 00:21:27,789
See. You're a pro at this.
Isn't this fun?

379
00:21:27,814 --> 00:21:28,991
- No.
- Atta girl.

380
00:21:29,016 --> 00:21:30,389
Alright everyone, fresh start.

381
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:32,454
We're going to have a good day
which will turn into a good week,

382
00:21:32,479 --> 00:21:35,149
which will turn into a good year,
which will turn into a good life!

383
00:21:35,180 --> 00:21:38,246
So, big day.
New school. New friends.

384
00:21:38,271 --> 00:21:40,652
I know. I'm kind of nervous
but I'm mostly excited.

385
00:21:40,677 --> 00:21:43,736
- How do I look? Do you like my coat?
- Very cute.

386
00:21:43,761 --> 00:21:45,694
You gonna be okay?
You want us to walk with you?

387
00:21:45,725 --> 00:21:48,297
Mom and Dad, with us in public.
No, thank you.

388
00:21:48,322 --> 00:21:49,370
Yup, I'm on it.

389
00:21:49,395 --> 00:21:51,788
Nope, I'm fine.
Bye Mom. Bye Dad.

390
00:21:51,813 --> 00:21:53,294
Have a good day in school, monkey.

391
00:21:53,319 --> 00:21:56,199
<i>( All making monkey noises )</i>

392
00:21:58,595 --> 00:22:00,877
Have a great day, sweetheart.

393
00:22:06,871 --> 00:22:08,889
- Are you sure we want to do this?
- In we go.

394
00:22:08,914 --> 00:22:12,066
Okay, going in. Yes!

395
00:22:17,303 --> 00:22:19,640
Okay. We've got a group of
cool girls at 2 o'clock.

396
00:22:19,665 --> 00:22:22,317
- How do you know?
- Double ears pierce. Infinity scarf.

397
00:22:22,342 --> 00:22:25,030
- Whoa. Is she wearing eye shadow?
- Yeah. We want to be friends with them.

398
00:22:25,068 --> 00:22:26,487
- Let's go talk to them.
- Are you kidding?

399
00:22:26,512 --> 00:22:29,227
We're not talking to them.
We want them to like us.

400
00:22:29,252 --> 00:22:30,520
Oh... yeah.
Wait.  What?

401
00:22:30,545 --> 00:22:32,627
Almost finished with
the potential disasters.

402
00:22:32,652 --> 00:22:36,173
Worst scenario is either quicksands,
spontaneous combustion

403
00:22:36,198 --> 00:22:39,147
or getting called on by the teacher.
As long as none of those happens...

404
00:22:39,172 --> 00:22:41,942
Okay, everybody.
We have a new student in class today.

405
00:22:41,967 --> 00:22:45,383
Are you kidding me! Out of the dates!
This is not happening!

406
00:22:45,408 --> 00:22:48,016
Riley, would you like to tell us
something about yourself?

407
00:22:48,041 --> 00:22:50,396
No!
Pretend we can't speak English.

408
00:22:50,421 --> 00:22:52,453
Don't worry.
I got this.

409
00:22:53,372 --> 00:22:54,758
Okay.

410
00:22:54,783 --> 00:22:56,521
My name is Riley Anderson.

411
00:22:56,553 --> 00:23:00,547
I'm from Minnesota
and now I live here.

412
00:23:01,794 --> 00:23:04,219
And how about Minnesota?

413
00:23:04,244 --> 00:23:05,663
Can you tell us something about it?

414
00:23:05,688 --> 00:23:08,659
Well you certainly get
a lot more snow than we do.

415
00:23:09,244 --> 00:23:12,972
Ha-ha-ha.
She's hilarious.

416
00:23:13,575 --> 00:23:15,124
Yeah, it get's pretty cold.

417
00:23:15,149 --> 00:23:17,635
The lake freezes over.
And that’s when we play hockey.

418
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:20,068
I'm on a great team.
We're called the Prairie dogs.

419
00:23:20,093 --> 00:23:23,403
My friend, Meg, plays forward
and my dad's the coach.

420
00:23:23,428 --> 00:23:25,919
Pretty much everyone in my family skates.

421
00:23:25,944 --> 00:23:27,414
It's kind of a family tradition.

422
00:23:27,438 --> 00:23:30,353
We go out on the lake
almost every weekend.

423
00:23:32,002 --> 00:23:33,825
Or, we did.
Till...

424
00:23:33,850 --> 00:23:35,114
I moved away.

425
00:23:35,139 --> 00:23:36,409
- Hey. What gives?
- What?

426
00:23:36,434 --> 00:23:38,874
Hey, Sadness.
You touched a memory.

427
00:23:38,899 --> 00:23:41,976
- We talked about this.
- Oh yeah, I know. I'm sorry...

428
00:23:42,001 --> 00:23:43,589
Get back in your circle.

429
00:23:43,614 --> 00:23:45,076
Ah.
What's going on?

430
00:23:45,101 --> 00:23:47,053
- Get it out of there, Joy.
- Eject.

431
00:23:47,129 --> 00:23:49,529
We used to play tag and stuff.

432
00:23:49,554 --> 00:23:51,457
Cool kids whispering at 3 o'clock.

433
00:23:51,482 --> 00:23:54,340
Did you see that look?
They're judging us!

434
00:23:54,952 --> 00:23:57,718
Somebody help grab that thing.
Everybody put in...

435
00:23:57,743 --> 00:24:00,521
But, everything is different now.

436
00:24:00,777 --> 00:24:02,649
Since we moved.

437
00:24:02,873 --> 00:24:04,242
<i>( Sniff )</i>

438
00:24:04,243 --> 00:24:07,696
Oh no.
We're crying at school!

439
00:24:07,721 --> 00:24:10,791
What?
Sadness, what are you doing!

440
00:24:11,846 --> 00:24:14,990
Oh, I'm sorry.
I'm, oh.

441
00:24:15,397 --> 00:24:18,921
- It's a Core Memory...
- But, it's blue...

442
00:24:19,784 --> 00:24:21,259
No!
Wait!

443
00:24:21,284 --> 00:24:22,915
Stop it!
No!

444
00:24:22,940 --> 00:24:24,433
No!

445
00:24:30,568 --> 00:24:32,003
Joy.
No.

446
00:24:32,028 --> 00:24:33,384
- That's a Core Memory!
- Hey!

447
00:24:33,409 --> 00:24:35,379
- Stop it.  Let go.
- Don't.  Wait.

448
00:24:35,765 --> 00:24:37,713
The Core Memories!

449
00:24:41,534 --> 00:24:42,900
Ahh!

450
00:24:51,848 --> 00:24:53,513
No-no-no...

451
00:24:57,633 --> 00:24:59,189
- Ahh!
- Ahh!

452
00:25:06,396 --> 00:25:07,672
Thank you, Riley.

453
00:25:07,697 --> 00:25:10,103
I know it can be tough
moving to a new place.

454
00:25:10,128 --> 00:25:12,781
But we are happy
to have you here.

455
00:25:12,806 --> 00:25:15,068
Alright everyone.
Get out you history books.

456
00:25:15,093 --> 00:25:17,514
And turn to chapter 7.

457
00:25:19,158 --> 00:25:21,759
Can I say that curse word now?

458
00:25:21,784 --> 00:25:23,821
- Ahh!
- Ahh!

459
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:27,755
Ahh!

460
00:25:32,673 --> 00:25:36,081
Ahh...!

461
00:25:38,692 --> 00:25:40,998
Ahh...

462
00:25:42,095 --> 00:25:45,723
Oh no!
1, 2, 3, okay.

463
00:25:46,629 --> 00:25:48,968
I got 'em all.
What? Where are we?

464
00:25:51,369 --> 00:25:52,568
Long term memory?

465
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:00,823
Goofball Island?

466
00:26:02,300 --> 00:26:05,900
Riley's islands of personality.
They're all down.

467
00:26:08,024 --> 00:26:10,024
- This is bad!
- We-we can fix this.

468
00:26:11,048 --> 00:26:13,748
We just have to get back
to headquarters, plug the

469
00:26:13,773 --> 00:26:16,572
Core Memories in, and Riley
will be back to normal.

470
00:26:18,060 --> 00:26:20,060
Riley has no Core Memories.

471
00:26:20,084 --> 00:26:22,084
No personality islands and no...

472
00:26:22,108 --> 00:26:23,807
<i>( Gasp )</i>

473
00:26:23,808 --> 00:26:25,308
What? What is it?

474
00:26:25,332 --> 00:26:26,332
You...

475
00:26:26,756 --> 00:26:28,256
You're not in headquarters...

476
00:26:28,380 --> 00:26:30,180
Without you, Riely can't be happy.

477
00:26:30,704 --> 00:26:32,404
We got to get you back up there.

478
00:26:32,928 --> 00:26:34,628
I'm coming, Riley.

479
00:26:49,052 --> 00:26:51,452
So, as it turns out the green
trash can is not recyling.

480
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:55,076
It's for greens, like
compost and eggshells.

481
00:26:55,500 --> 00:26:57,500
And the blue one is recyling.
And the black one...

482
00:26:57,724 --> 00:26:59,724
Riley is acting so weird.
Why is she acting so weird?

483
00:27:00,048 --> 00:27:02,048
Well what do you expect?
All the islands are down.

484
00:27:02,072 --> 00:27:04,072
- Joy would know what to do.
- That's it.

485
00:27:04,596 --> 00:27:07,596
Until she gets back we just
do what Joy would do.

486
00:27:07,920 --> 00:27:09,749
Great idea. Anger. Fear. Disgust.

487
00:27:10,774 --> 00:27:12,244
How are we supposed to be happy?

488
00:27:12,268 --> 00:27:13,768
Hey, Riley. I've got good news.

489
00:27:14,292 --> 00:27:16,992
I found a junior hockey league.
Right here, in San Francisco.

490
00:27:17,016 --> 00:27:19,716
And get this: tryouts are
tomorrow after school.

491
00:27:19,740 --> 00:27:21,740
What luck, right?

492
00:27:21,764 --> 00:27:23,764
- Huh?
- Uh-oh. What do we do?

493
00:27:23,788 --> 00:27:25,788
Guys, t-t-this is...you-you
pretend to be Joy.

494
00:27:26,012 --> 00:27:28,012
Wouldn't is be great
to be back out on the ice?

495
00:27:29,536 --> 00:27:31,536
Oh yea, that sounds fantastic.

496
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:34,760
What was that!? That
wasn't anything like Joy.

497
00:27:34,784 --> 00:27:37,184
- Uh, that's because I'm not Joy.
- Yea, no kidding.

498
00:27:39,008 --> 00:27:40,708
Did you guys pick up on that?

499
00:27:41,732 --> 00:27:43,732
- Somethings wrong.
- Should we ask her?

500
00:27:44,056 --> 00:27:46,256
Let's probe. But keep it subtle,
so she doesn't notice.

501
00:27:46,680 --> 00:27:48,980
So...How was the first day of school?

502
00:27:49,004 --> 00:27:51,504
- She's probing us.
- I'm done. You pretend to be Joy.

503
00:27:51,528 --> 00:27:53,828
What? Ok...umm...hmmm...

504
00:27:53,952 --> 00:27:56,952
It was fine I guess...I don't know...

505
00:27:57,676 --> 00:27:59,676
Oh, very smooth.

506
00:27:59,700 --> 00:28:01,300
That was just like Joy.

507
00:28:01,424 --> 00:28:03,124
Something is definitely going on.

508
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:05,548
Shes never acted like this before.
What should we do?

509
00:28:05,572 --> 00:28:08,172
We're going to find out what's happening.
But we'll need support.

510
00:28:08,196 --> 00:28:09,396
Signal the husband.

511
00:28:10,020 --> 00:28:12,020
<i>( Clears throat )</i>

512
00:28:13,044 --> 00:28:16,044
<i>( All cheering )</i>

513
00:28:16,568 --> 00:28:18,068
<i>( Clears throat )</i>

514
00:28:19,844 --> 00:28:22,034
Uh-oh.
She's looking at us.

515
00:28:22,586 --> 00:28:23,979
- What did she say?
- What?

516
00:28:24,004 --> 00:28:25,863
Oh, sorry, sir.
No one was listening.

517
00:28:25,888 --> 00:28:28,229
Is it garbage night?
We left the toilet seat up?

518
00:28:28,254 --> 00:28:30,385
What? What is it, woman?
What!?

519
00:28:30,410 --> 00:28:34,450
- He's making that stupid face again.
- I could strangle him right now!

520
00:28:34,475 --> 00:28:36,674
Signal him again.

521
00:28:38,091 --> 00:28:39,651
Ah! So...

522
00:28:39,676 --> 00:28:41,014
Riley, how was school?

523
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:42,904
<i>( All complaining )</i>

524
00:28:42,929 --> 00:28:46,292
For this, we gave up that
Brazilian helicopter pilot?

525
00:28:46,317 --> 00:28:48,175
Move!
I'll be joy.

526
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:50,261
School was great.
Alright?

527
00:28:50,286 --> 00:28:52,826
Riley, is everything okay?

528
00:28:53,755 --> 00:28:55,540
Sir, she just rolled her eyes at us.

529
00:28:55,565 --> 00:28:56,897
What is her deal?

530
00:28:56,929 --> 00:29:00,267
Alright, make a show of force.
I don't want to have to put the foot down.

531
00:29:00,292 --> 00:29:02,214
No...Not the foot!

532
00:29:02,239 --> 00:29:04,628
Riley, I do not like this new attitude.

533
00:29:04,653 --> 00:29:06,382
Oh. I'll show you
attitude, old man.

534
00:29:06,407 --> 00:29:07,860
No-no-no-no!
Stay happy!

535
00:29:08,416 --> 00:29:10,695
What is your problem?
Just leave me alone!

536
00:29:10,720 --> 00:29:12,900
Sir, reporting high
levels of sass.

537
00:29:12,925 --> 00:29:14,510
Take it to DEFCON 2.

538
00:29:14,535 --> 00:29:17,233
You heard that gentlemen!
DEFCON 2!

539
00:29:17,757 --> 00:29:21,365
Listen, young lady. I don't know where
this disrespectful attitude came from.

540
00:29:21,390 --> 00:29:24,252
You want a piece of this, pops?
Come and get it!

541
00:29:24,277 --> 00:29:26,024
Yeah...Well-well...

542
00:29:26,049 --> 00:29:29,057
Here it comes.
Prepare the foot!

543
00:29:29,762 --> 00:29:31,894
Keys to safety position.

544
00:29:33,084 --> 00:29:35,621
Ready to launch
on your command, sir.

545
00:29:36,189 --> 00:29:37,570
AHHHH!!

546
00:29:37,595 --> 00:29:39,474
Just, shut up!

547
00:29:40,175 --> 00:29:41,659
FIRE!

548
00:29:41,684 --> 00:29:43,917
That's it!
Go to your room.

549
00:29:44,342 --> 00:29:46,120
Now.

550
00:29:48,751 --> 00:29:52,336
Foot is down!
The foot is down!

551
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:56,872
Good job, gentlemen.
That could've been a disaster...

552
00:29:56,913 --> 00:29:59,025
Well, that was a disaster...

553
00:30:01,932 --> 00:30:05,567
Come. Fly with me, criancinha.

554
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,597
<i>( All swooning )</i>

555
00:30:16,796 --> 00:30:19,919
We're gonna walk
out there...on that?

556
00:30:19,944 --> 00:30:21,617
It's the quickest way back.

557
00:30:21,655 --> 00:30:26,234
But it's right over the Memory Dump.
If we fall, we'll be forgotten forever.

558
00:30:26,259 --> 00:30:28,116
We have to do this for Riley.

559
00:30:28,141 --> 00:30:30,408
Just, follow my footsteps.

560
00:30:30,433 --> 00:30:33,608
Not that high.
It's totally fi...

561
00:30:41,438 --> 00:30:43,514
Wooah.

562
00:30:49,702 --> 00:30:51,257
Hey.

563
00:30:51,430 --> 00:30:52,970
So, uh...

564
00:30:52,995 --> 00:30:55,654
Things got a little out
of hand downstairs.

565
00:30:55,679 --> 00:30:57,790
You wanna talk about it?

566
00:30:58,606 --> 00:31:01,581
Come on. Where's my happy girl?

567
00:31:02,712 --> 00:31:04,522
Monkey.
<i>( Monkey noises )</i>

568
00:31:04,547 --> 00:31:07,497
Whoa!
He's trying to start up Goofball.

569
00:31:07,921 --> 00:31:11,265
<i>( Monkey noises )</i>

570
00:31:21,546 --> 00:31:23,592
Sadness!
Turn right back!

571
00:31:51,135 --> 00:31:52,809
What the...?

572
00:32:07,724 --> 00:32:11,562
I get it.
You need some alone time.

573
00:32:13,289 --> 00:32:15,242
Then we'll talk later.

574
00:32:18,303 --> 00:32:22,827
- We have a major problem.
- Oh, Joy. Where are you?

575
00:32:23,232 --> 00:32:25,873
We lost Goofball Island.

576
00:32:25,898 --> 00:32:30,792
That means she can lose Friendship
and Hockey and Honesty and Family.

577
00:32:30,817 --> 00:32:33,184
You can fixed this.
Right, Joy?

578
00:32:33,209 --> 00:32:35,541
I-I...

579
00:32:35,566 --> 00:32:36,784
- I don't know.
- Oh.

580
00:32:36,809 --> 00:32:39,662
But we have to try.
Okay, come on.

581
00:32:40,475 --> 00:32:42,473
- Riley's gone to sleep.
- Oh.

582
00:32:42,498 --> 00:32:45,853
Which is a good thing
If... When you think about it.

583
00:32:45,878 --> 00:32:48,629
Because nothing else bad
can happen when she's asleep.

584
00:32:48,655 --> 00:32:50,828
We'll be back to Headquarters
before she wakes up.

585
00:32:50,853 --> 00:32:54,255
We'll just go across
Friendship Island.

586
00:32:55,686 --> 00:32:58,200
- Oh, we'll never make it.
- No-no-no...

587
00:32:58,229 --> 00:32:59,938
Don't obsess over the
weight of life's problems.

588
00:32:59,963 --> 00:33:02,036
Remember the funny movie
where the dog dies.

589
00:33:02,061 --> 00:33:04,571
Oh, Sadness.
We don't have time for this.

590
00:33:04,596 --> 00:33:06,456
We'll-we'll just have to go around.

591
00:33:06,481 --> 00:33:08,136
Take the scenic route.

592
00:33:08,161 --> 00:33:10,681
Wait. Joy, you can get lost in there.

593
00:33:10,857 --> 00:33:13,123
- Think positive!
- Okay.

594
00:33:13,148 --> 00:33:16,390
I'm positive you will
get lost in there.

595
00:33:16,415 --> 00:33:18,333
That's long term memory.

596
00:33:18,358 --> 00:33:20,674
An endless swarm of corridors and shelves.

597
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:23,387
I read about it in the manuals.

598
00:33:23,412 --> 00:33:24,749
The manuals?

599
00:33:25,374 --> 00:33:26,408
The manuals!

600
00:33:26,433 --> 00:33:27,981
- You read the manuals.
- Yeah.

601
00:33:28,106 --> 00:33:30,328
So you know the way back
to headquarters.

602
00:33:30,353 --> 00:33:34,605
- I guess.
- Woo-Hnn!

603
00:33:34,630 --> 00:33:35,961
You are my map!

604
00:33:35,986 --> 00:33:38,219
Let's go! Lead on, my map!

605
00:33:38,244 --> 00:33:39,391
Show me where we're going!

606
00:33:39,416 --> 00:33:41,386
Okay! Only...

607
00:33:41,411 --> 00:33:43,144
I'm too sad to walk.

608
00:33:43,169 --> 00:33:47,671
Just give me a few...hours to...

609
00:33:47,907 --> 00:33:50,704
- Which way, left?
- Right.

610
00:33:50,745 --> 00:33:54,275
No, I mean go left.
I said left was right like correct.

611
00:33:54,303 --> 00:33:55,342
Okay.

612
00:33:55,374 --> 00:33:57,646
This actually feels kind of nice.

613
00:33:57,671 --> 00:34:01,490
Okay, here we go. We'll be back
to Headquarters before morning.

614
00:34:01,515 --> 00:34:03,542
We can do it.
This will be easy!

615
00:34:03,567 --> 00:34:06,028
This is working.

616
00:34:08,279 --> 00:34:09,642
This is not working.

617
00:34:09,675 --> 00:34:13,405
- Are we getting close?
- Yeah. Just another right.

618
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:17,618
And a left.
And then another left.

619
00:34:17,643 --> 00:34:20,536
Are you sure you know
where we're going?

620
00:34:20,561 --> 00:34:23,937
'Cause we seem to be
walking away from Headquarters.

621
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:26,291
Oh.
Riley's awake.

622
00:34:26,854 --> 00:34:28,936
Oh! Oh! uh...

623
00:34:30,023 --> 00:34:31,749
Don't-don't touch, remember?

624
00:34:31,774 --> 00:34:34,356
If you touch them,
they stay sad.

625
00:34:34,381 --> 00:34:36,700
Oh, Sorry.
I-I won't.

626
00:34:36,745 --> 00:34:40,333
- Starting now.
- I can't take much more of this.

627
00:34:40,358 --> 00:34:41,905
Forget 'em!

628
00:34:41,930 --> 00:34:45,590
- Mind workers.
- But, Joy, we're almost...oh...

629
00:34:45,615 --> 00:34:47,466
Phone numbers.
We don't need all these.

630
00:34:47,494 --> 00:34:48,466
They're in her phone.

631
00:34:48,491 --> 00:34:49,814
- Just forget all that, please.
- Excuse me! Hi!

632
00:34:49,839 --> 00:34:51,776
Forget it.

633
00:34:52,101 --> 00:34:55,307
- I need to find Friendship Island.
- Look at this. 4 years of piano lessons.

634
00:34:55,332 --> 00:34:56,398
Yeah.
It looks pretty faded.

635
00:34:56,423 --> 00:34:59,572
You know what. Save Chopsticks and
Heart and Soul, get rid of the rest.

636
00:34:59,826 --> 00:35:01,720
US presidents. What do you think?

637
00:35:01,745 --> 00:35:03,619
Just keep Washington,
Lincoln and the fat one.

638
00:35:03,644 --> 00:35:04,984
- Forget them!
- Hey!

639
00:35:05,009 --> 00:35:07,540
You can't throw those away.
Those are perfectly good memories.

640
00:35:07,565 --> 00:35:09,963
The names of every
Cutiepie princess doll?

641
00:35:10,007 --> 00:35:11,914
Yes.
That is critical information.

642
00:35:11,939 --> 00:35:14,723
- Glitter storm, Honey pants...
- Forget them.

643
00:35:19,250 --> 00:35:21,089
- Hey! Bring those back.
- They're in the Dump.

644
00:35:21,114 --> 00:35:24,411
- Nothing comes back from the Dump.
- Yeah. Look, lady. This is our job, okay.

645
00:35:24,436 --> 00:35:26,619
When Riley doesn't care
about a memory, it fades.

646
00:35:26,644 --> 00:35:28,202
- Fades?
- Happens to the best of them.

647
00:35:28,227 --> 00:35:30,309
Except for this bad boy.

648
00:35:30,334 --> 00:35:32,588
This one will never fade.

649
00:35:34,178 --> 00:35:35,644
The song from the
gum commercial?

650
00:35:35,668 --> 00:35:37,908
You know, sometimes we send that one
up to Headquarters for no reason.

651
00:35:37,934 --> 00:35:42,312
It just plays in Riley's head over
and over again like a million times.

652
00:35:42,337 --> 00:35:44,599
Let's watch it again.

653
00:35:45,126 --> 00:35:48,120
Yeah, I know. We all know the song.
Okay, real catchy.

654
00:35:48,145 --> 00:35:50,559
- Hey. What do you think, should we do it?
- Yeah.

655
00:35:50,584 --> 00:35:54,735
Okay. Here we go!
Ha-ha-ha.

656
00:35:56,191 --> 00:35:58,127
What the?
This again!?

657
00:35:58,152 --> 00:35:59,337
Ha.
Great.

658
00:35:59,362 --> 00:36:02,675
Wait! Do you know how to
get to Friendship Island?

659
00:36:02,980 --> 00:36:05,364
Do you like it there?
Did you feel any earthquakes?

660
00:36:05,389 --> 00:36:06,553
Is the bridge cool?

661
00:36:06,578 --> 00:36:08,978
Yea...Good.
What happened with the playoffs.

662
00:36:09,003 --> 00:36:12,367
We won the first game. Coach says we
might actually go to the finals this year.

663
00:36:12,392 --> 00:36:15,456
Oh, and we got this new girl
 on the team. She's so cool!

664
00:36:15,481 --> 00:36:17,990
- Uh. She did not just say that.
- A new girl?

665
00:36:18,015 --> 00:36:20,201
Meg has a new friend already?

666
00:36:20,226 --> 00:36:21,523
Hey-hey.
Stay happy.

667
00:36:21,548 --> 00:36:23,755
We do not want to lose
anymore islands here, guys.

668
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:26,019
We can pass the puck to each other
without even looking.

669
00:36:26,044 --> 00:36:27,509
It's like mind reading.

670
00:36:27,534 --> 00:36:28,901
You like to read minds, Meg?

671
00:36:28,926 --> 00:36:30,141
I got something for you to read right here!

672
00:36:30,179 --> 00:36:32,151
Wait-wait-wait. Let's just
be calm for one second.

673
00:36:32,177 --> 00:36:33,591
Ahh!!

674
00:36:33,818 --> 00:36:35,222
- I got to got.
- What?

675
00:36:35,247 --> 00:36:37,081
I got to go!

676
00:36:37,520 --> 00:36:40,933
Wait, could you just please
tell me which way is...

677
00:36:40,958 --> 00:36:42,609
Oh no!

678
00:36:45,013 --> 00:36:47,473
Friendship Island!
What?

679
00:36:58,678 --> 00:37:00,776
Not Friendship...

680
00:37:05,673 --> 00:37:10,634
Oh, Riley loved that one.
And now it's gone.

681
00:37:10,659 --> 00:37:14,829
Goodbye Friendship,
hello Loneliness.

682
00:37:18,057 --> 00:37:20,765
We'll just have to go the long way.

683
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:26,527
Yeah. The long, long,
long, long way.

684
00:37:26,552 --> 00:37:28,569
I'm ready.

685
00:37:29,343 --> 00:37:32,279
There's got to be a better way.

686
00:37:33,511 --> 00:37:36,401
- Woo. Well look at you.
- Huh?

687
00:37:36,426 --> 00:37:39,129
I will take you,
but not you.

688
00:37:39,154 --> 00:37:41,563
Ah! Who am I kidding?
I can't leave you!

689
00:37:41,595 --> 00:37:42,938
Hello!

690
00:37:42,963 --> 00:37:45,452
- Ahh!
- Wait. Hey, wait!

691
00:37:46,897 --> 00:37:48,778
No, wait!
Stop!

692
00:37:54,020 --> 00:37:56,520
<i>( Panting )</i>

693
00:37:57,110 --> 00:37:59,021
- Excuse me?
- Ahh!

694
00:37:59,046 --> 00:38:00,881
Oh, I was-I was looking for...umm...

695
00:38:00,906 --> 00:38:02,202
- diversion!
- What?

696
00:38:02,227 --> 00:38:04,725
Ha ha!
So long, sucker!

697
00:38:05,283 --> 00:38:06,492
Ow. I hurt all over...

698
00:38:06,517 --> 00:38:08,155
Wait, I know you...

699
00:38:08,180 --> 00:38:10,575
No, you don't.
I get that a lot.

700
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:13,479
- I look like a lot of people.
- No, no, no...I do.

701
00:38:13,504 --> 00:38:16,277
Bing-Bong!
Riley's imaginary friend!

702
00:38:16,302 --> 00:38:18,765
- You really do know me?
- Well, of course!

703
00:38:18,790 --> 00:38:21,462
Riley loved playings with you.
You two were best friends.

704
00:38:21,487 --> 00:38:22,836
Oh, oh. You would know...

705
00:38:22,861 --> 00:38:25,028
- We're trying to get back to Headquarters.
- Headquarters?

706
00:38:25,053 --> 00:38:27,682
- You guys are from Headquarters?
- Well, yeah.

707
00:38:27,707 --> 00:38:29,196
I'm Joy.
This is Sadness.

708
00:38:29,221 --> 00:38:31,254
- You're Joy? The Joy?
- Uh-huh.

709
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:33,196
Well, what the heck
are you doing out here?

710
00:38:33,200 --> 00:38:35,575
That's a good question.
You want to answer that, Sadness?

711
00:38:36,421 --> 00:38:38,655
Without you Riley won't ever be happy.

712
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,115
We can't have that.

713
00:38:40,140 --> 00:38:41,183
We got to get you back.

714
00:38:41,208 --> 00:38:42,432
I'll tell you what.
Follow me.

715
00:38:42,507 --> 00:38:43,507
Thank you!

716
00:38:43,732 --> 00:38:45,706
It is so great to see you again.

717
00:38:45,730 --> 00:38:47,785
I got to tell you.
I'm such a huge fan of your work.

718
00:38:47,910 --> 00:38:50,251
Do you remember when
you and Riley were in a band?

719
00:38:50,276 --> 00:38:50,997
Ha-ha-ha.

720
00:38:51,022 --> 00:38:53,359
I went to all of your concerts.

721
00:38:53,384 --> 00:38:54,795
Yeah, I blow a mean nose.

722
00:38:54,820 --> 00:38:57,387
- Watching you play tag was such a treat.
- Two time world champ!

723
00:38:57,412 --> 00:38:59,287
Oh, and remember your rockets?

724
00:38:59,312 --> 00:39:01,765
Of course! It runs on song power!

725
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,427
That's right!
Your theme song.

What exactly are you
suppose to be?

731
00:39:11,600 --> 00:39:13,035
You know it's unclear...

732
00:39:13,060 --> 00:39:14,307
I'm mostly cotton candy.

733
00:39:14,338 --> 00:39:15,955
But shape wise:

734
00:39:16,080 --> 00:39:19,287
I'm part cat, part elephant, part dolphin.

735
00:39:19,312 --> 00:39:20,539
Dolphin?

<i>( Dolphin noises )</i>

737
00:39:23,156 --> 00:39:26,096
You got to remember: When Riley
was three, animals were all the rage.

738
00:39:26,121 --> 00:39:28,125
The cow goes "moo."
The horse goes "neigh."

739
00:39:28,150 --> 00:39:29,907
It's all the people
talked about back then.

740
00:39:29,932 --> 00:39:31,315
Yeah, yeah.
I guess that's true.

741
00:39:31,940 --> 00:39:33,571
- What are you doing out here?
- Well...

742
00:39:33,596 --> 00:39:36,290
There's not much call for
imaginary friends lately.

743
00:39:36,315 --> 00:39:40,080
So, I...You know...umm...

744
00:39:40,378 --> 00:39:42,802
Hey, Hey. Don't be sad.

745
00:39:42,827 --> 00:39:44,903
Tell you what:
When I get back up to Headquarters,

746
00:39:44,928 --> 00:39:47,215
I'll make sure Riley remembers you.

747
00:39:47,240 --> 00:39:49,645
- You will?
- Of course! She'd love that!

748
00:39:49,670 --> 00:39:53,703
Ha-ha!
This is the greatest day of my life!

749
00:39:53,727 --> 00:39:54,375
( Crunch )

750
00:39:54,376 --> 00:39:56,956
Ahh! Ow, ow, ow...

751
00:39:57,237 --> 00:40:00,041
- Are you okay?
- Hey, what's going on?

752
00:40:00,066 --> 00:40:01,400
I cry candy.

753
00:40:01,425 --> 00:40:04,136
- Try the caramel, it's delicious.
- Ooo.

754
00:40:04,161 --> 00:40:05,587
- Whoa!
- Ooo.

755
00:40:05,612 --> 00:40:07,185
- Here use this.
- Thanks.

756
00:40:07,210 --> 00:40:09,213
Oh, hold on.
Wait a second.

757
00:40:11,749 --> 00:40:14,733
It always get stuck
at the bottom.

758
00:40:16,508 --> 00:40:17,977
Here.

759
00:40:18,008 --> 00:40:19,719
What?
It's imaginary.

760
00:40:19,744 --> 00:40:22,708
Thanks. This will make it a lot easier
to walk back to Headquarters.

761
00:40:22,733 --> 00:40:24,394
Walk?
We're not walking.

762
00:40:24,419 --> 00:40:28,034
We're taking the Train of Thought!

763
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:30,184
The Train!
Of course!

764
00:40:30,209 --> 00:40:32,830
That is so much faster!
But how do we catch it?

765
00:40:32,855 --> 00:40:37,299
Well, it kind of go all over the place
but there is a station in Imagination Land.

766
00:40:37,324 --> 00:40:39,903
I know a shortcut.
Come on, this way!

767
00:40:39,928 --> 00:40:42,610
Oh, I'm so glad
we ran into you!

768
00:40:42,635 --> 00:40:44,529
The station is right through here.

769
00:40:44,554 --> 00:40:45,427
After you.

770
00:40:45,452 --> 00:40:46,932
- Joy.
- What?

771
00:40:46,957 --> 00:40:49,016
Well, I read about this
place in the manual.

772
00:40:49,041 --> 00:40:50,205
We shouldn't go in there.

773
00:40:50,230 --> 00:40:52,147
Bing-Bong says it's the
quickest way to Headquarters.

774
00:40:52,178 --> 00:40:54,382
No. But Joy,
this is abstract thought.

775
00:40:54,407 --> 00:40:56,743
What are you talking about?
I go in here all the time.

776
00:40:56,768 --> 00:40:58,528
It's a shortcut.
You see.

777
00:40:58,559 --> 00:41:00,210
D-A-N-G-E-R.

778
00:41:00,235 --> 00:41:01,320
Shortcut.

779
00:41:01,345 --> 00:41:03,151
I'll prove it to you.

780
00:41:03,264 --> 00:41:04,572
Look at me.

781
00:41:04,597 --> 00:41:08,638
I'm crossing to the station!
'Cause I'm taking the shortcut!

782
00:41:08,663 --> 00:41:10,487
Let's-let's go around. This way.

783
00:41:10,512 --> 00:41:12,910
Almost there!

784
00:41:13,161 --> 00:41:15,677
If you want to walk
the long way, go for it.

785
00:41:15,702 --> 00:41:19,401
But Riley needs to be happy.
I'm not missing that Train.

786
00:41:19,426 --> 00:41:21,036
Bing-Bong knows
what he is doing.

787
00:41:21,061 --> 00:41:22,883
He's part dolphin,
they're very smart.

788
00:41:22,908 --> 00:41:25,411
Well...I guess.

00:41:28,435 --> 00:41:30,435
<i>( Indistinct chatter )</i>

790
00:41:43,759 --> 00:41:47,326
Okay. What abstract concept are we
trying to comprehend today?

791
00:41:47,451 --> 00:41:49,009
- Umm...Loneliness.
- Hm.

792
00:41:49,334 --> 00:41:50,971
I think there is
something in there.

793
00:41:51,002 --> 00:41:53,566
I'm going to turn it on for a minute
and burn out the gunk.

794
00:41:53,591 --> 00:41:56,599
What did I tell ya?
You'll be in Headquarters in no time.

795
00:41:57,388 --> 00:41:59,362
Hey, will you look at that?

796
00:41:59,387 --> 00:42:02,482
- Whoa. What's happening?
- Oh no, they turned it on.

797
00:42:02,507 --> 00:42:04,393
Huh? Never seen this before.

798
00:42:04,417 --> 00:42:05,517
<i>( Both )</i> Ahh!

My face! My beautiful face! Whoa!

801
00:42:10,632 --> 00:42:12,428
- What is going on?
- We're abstracting!

802
00:42:12,453 --> 00:42:14,498
There are four stages.
This is the first.

803
00:42:14,523 --> 00:42:16,476
Nonobjective fragmentation.

804
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:17,784
Alright, do not panic!

805
00:42:17,809 --> 00:42:20,582
What is important is that
we all stay together.

806
00:42:20,607 --> 00:42:21,613
- Oh.
- Ahh!

807
00:42:21,638 --> 00:42:24,378
We're in the second stage!
We’re deconstructing!

808
00:42:24,403 --> 00:42:25,993
Run!

809
00:42:26,018 --> 00:42:29,381
Ahh!
I can't feel my legs!

810
00:42:29,406 --> 00:42:30,741
Oh, there they are.

811
00:42:30,766 --> 00:42:32,171
Come here, me!

812
00:42:33,414 --> 00:42:34,992
We got to get out of here!

813
00:42:35,017 --> 00:42:37,358
Before we're nothing
but shape and color!

814
00:42:37,383 --> 00:42:39,123
We'll get stuck here forever!

815
00:42:39,148 --> 00:42:40,844
Bong, why did we come in here!?

816
00:42:40,869 --> 00:42:43,755
I told you!
It's a shortcut!

817
00:42:43,780 --> 00:42:45,353
<i>( Gasp )</i> The Train!

- Death! Unlucky death!

00:42:59,825 --> 00:43:01,519
We can't fit!

822
00:43:01,544 --> 00:43:05,126
Oh no, we're not figurative!
This is the last stage!

823
00:43:05,151 --> 00:43:07,252
We're not gonna make it!

824
00:43:08,900 --> 00:43:12,975
Wait, we're 2 dimensional.
Fall on your face!

825
00:43:23,068 --> 00:43:25,952
Stop!
Stop!

826
00:43:27,251 --> 00:43:28,003
No!

827
00:43:28,028 --> 00:43:29,482
You said that was a shortcut.

828
00:43:29,528 --> 00:43:30,392
I did.

829
00:43:30,417 --> 00:43:32,584
But wow, we should not
had gone in there.

830
00:43:32,609 --> 00:43:33,498
That was dangerous.

831
00:43:33,523 --> 00:43:34,852
They should really
put up a sign.

832
00:43:34,877 --> 00:43:37,122
- How long till the next Train?
- Who knows?

833
00:43:37,147 --> 00:43:39,705
But don’t worry.
There's another station. That way.

834
00:43:39,730 --> 00:43:42,988
The Train always stops there,
right before it goes to Headquarters.

835
00:43:43,013 --> 00:43:45,012
If we hurry,
we can catch it!

836
00:43:45,037 --> 00:43:47,226

of your shortcuts, is it?

00:43:47,251 --> 00:43:49,866
Ha-ha-ha.
Yeah!

- Uh-huh. Through there.

848
00:44:16,853 --> 00:44:18,895
Aww, participation award.

849
00:44:18,919 --> 00:44:20,817
Wait, is that?
Is that a...Look!

850
00:44:20,842 --> 00:44:22,512
It's Cloud Town!

851
00:44:22,537 --> 00:44:24,419
That's my favorite!
Hoo-hoo-hoo.

852
00:44:24,444 --> 00:44:27,363
- Oh, it's so soft!
- Ho ho ho. Let me try!

853
00:44:27,388 --> 00:44:29,460
Hey!
What's the big idea?

854
00:44:29,485 --> 00:44:33,139
You better fix that wall or else

Oh no, lava!
Woo. Whoa.

857
00:44:37,261 --> 00:44:40,211
Imagination Land is the best!

858
00:44:40,435 --> 00:44:43,272
Does it all got
to be so interactive?

859
00:44:43,297 --> 00:44:45,482
Hey look!
The House of Cards!

860
00:44:45,507 --> 00:44:48,118
Woo wait.
Hang on just a minute!

861
00:44:48,143 --> 00:44:49,450
- Your rocket!
- Yeah.

862
00:44:49,475 --> 00:44:51,290
I stashed it in there
for safekeeping.

863
00:44:51,315 --> 00:44:54,707
And now I'm all set
to take Riley to the moon!

864
00:44:54,732 --> 00:44:55,820
Oh, I'm sorry.

865
00:44:55,845 --> 00:44:56,853
Great.

866
00:44:56,878 --> 00:44:59,853
- Whoa. I love Imagination Land!
- Isn't it great?

867
00:44:59,878 --> 00:45:02,228
And there's always
something new like...

868
00:45:04,496 --> 00:45:07,366
- Who the heck is that?
- Imaginary boyfriend.

869
00:45:07,391 --> 00:45:09,667
- I would die for Riley.
- Oh, gu...

870
00:45:09,692 --> 00:45:11,331
I've never seen him before.

871
00:45:11,356 --> 00:45:12,727
I live in Canada.

872
00:45:12,752 --> 00:45:16,545
Anyway, through Preschool World.
We're nearly to The Train!

873
00:45:16,570 --> 00:45:20,125
Riley, here we come!
Woo-Hoo! Ha-ha-ha!

874
00:45:20,534 --> 00:45:24,261
This should be fun!
New team. New friends.

875
00:45:24,286 --> 00:45:25,661
There kids looked pretty good.

876
00:45:25,686 --> 00:45:28,681
Considering they're from
San Francisco. Heh-heh-heh.

877
00:45:28,706 --> 00:45:31,572
- Got to go.
- Okay. Good luck, sweetie!

878
00:45:31,601 --> 00:45:32,963
Luck isn't going to help us now.

879
00:45:32,988 --> 00:45:34,888
If she tries to use Hockey Island.
It's going down.

880
00:45:34,913 --> 00:45:38,554
Which is why, I've recalled
every hockey memory I can think of.

881
00:45:38,579 --> 00:45:41,151
One of these is got to work
in place of a Core Memory.

882
00:45:41,176 --> 00:45:43,862
- She's about to play!
- Hurry!

883
00:45:49,429 --> 00:45:53,000
Ha ha! We did it gang!
It's working!

884
00:45:53,025 --> 00:45:54,533
Ow!

885
00:46:04,562 --> 00:46:07,378
Ha ha ha.
No-no-no... Ahh!

886
00:46:11,916 --> 00:46:14,319
It's like we don't learn anything.

887
00:46:20,532 --> 00:46:21,761
- That's it!
- No no no.

888
00:46:21,786 --> 00:46:23,609
Free on your happy place.

889
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:26,231
Ahh!

890
00:46:35,716 --> 00:46:37,704
- Riley, what's wrong?
- Let's go.

891
00:46:37,729 --> 00:46:39,870
- You're not going to finish try outs?
- What's the point?

892
00:46:39,895 --> 00:46:42,019
Hey. It will be alright.

893
00:46:42,044 --> 00:46:45,187
- Let's just go ba-
- Stop saying everything will be alright!

894
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:58,542
Hockey!

895
00:47:00,465 --> 00:47:03,135
Oh no no.
She loves hockey.

896
00:47:03,160 --> 00:47:05,640
She can't give up hockey.

897
00:47:07,461 --> 00:47:09,127
Bing-Bong,
we have to get to that station.

898
00:47:09,152 --> 00:47:11,627
Sure thing. This way,
just past Graham Cracker Castle.

899
00:47:11,652 --> 00:47:13,370
Hey...That's weird.

900
00:47:13,395 --> 00:47:16,302
Graham Cracker Castle used to be right here.
I wonder why they moved it.

901
00:47:16,389 --> 00:47:17,522
Huh, that's odd...

902
00:47:17,847 --> 00:47:20,121
I would have sworn Sparkle
Pony Mountain was right here.

903
00:47:20,246 --> 00:47:21,940
- Hey, what's going on?
- Yeah yeah. I don't know.

904
00:47:21,965 --> 00:47:24,701
- We'll have to come back.
- <i>( Gasp )</i> Princess Dreamworld!

905
00:47:26,238 --> 00:47:29,834
Oh, The Stuffed Animal Hall of Fame!

<i>( Gasp )</i> My rocket!

907
00:47:32,563 --> 00:47:35,485
Wait! Riley and I were
still using that rocket!

908
00:47:35,637 --> 00:47:37,423
It still has some song power left!

909
00:47:37,448 --> 00:47:39,046
Who's your friend

No! No! No!

913
00:47:47,288 --> 00:47:51,577
You can't bring my rocket to the Dump!
Riley and I are going to the moon!

914
00:47:56,467 --> 00:47:59,320
Riley can't be done with me...

915
00:48:04,714 --> 00:48:08,270
Hey, it's going to be okay.
We can fix this.

916
00:48:08,295 --> 00:48:11,708
We just need to get back to Headquarters.
Which way to The Train station?

917
00:48:11,733 --> 00:48:15,198
I had a whole trip
planned for us.

918
00:48:15,479 --> 00:48:17,834
Hey, who's ticklish? Huh?

919
00:48:17,859 --> 00:48:20,872
Here comes the tickle monster.

920
00:48:21,574 --> 00:48:23,301
Hey, Bing-Bong, look at this.

921

<i>( Silly sounds )</i>

922
00:48:26,009 --> 00:48:27,117
Oh, here's a fun game:

923
00:48:27,142 --> 00:48:28,728
You point to The Train station,

924
00:48:28,753 --> 00:48:31,038
and we all go there!

925
00:48:31,063 --> 00:48:32,723
Won't that be fun?

926
00:48:32,747 --> 00:48:35,272
Come on, let's go to The Train station!

927
00:48:36,422 --> 00:48:39,101
I'm sorry they took your rocket.

928
00:48:39,164 --> 00:48:42,654
They took something that
you loved. It's gone.

929
00:48:42,679 --> 00:48:43,773
 Forever.

930
00:48:43,798 --> 00:48:46,893
- Sadness, don't make him feel worse.
- Sorry.

931
00:48:46,918 --> 00:48:49,355
It's all I had left of Riley.

932
00:48:49,380 --> 00:48:52,279
I bet you and Riley
had great adventures.

933
00:48:52,304 --> 00:48:54,352
Oh, they were wonderful.

934
00:48:54,377 --> 00:48:58,437
Once, we flew back in time.
We had breakfast twice that day.

935
00:48:58,462 --> 00:49:02,521
- Sadness!
- It sounds amazing. I bet Riley liked it.

936
00:49:02,546 --> 00:49:06,794
Oh, she did.
We were best friends.

937
00:49:06,819 --> 00:49:09,773
Yeah, it's sad...

I'm okay now.

941
00:49:24,236 --> 00:49:27,951
Come on.
The Train Station is this way.

942
00:49:33,597 --> 00:49:35,868
- How did you do that?
- Oh, I don't know.

943
00:49:35,893 --> 00:49:39,217
- I feel sad so I listen to what...
- Hey!

944
00:49:39,242 --> 00:49:41,413
There's The Train!

945
00:49:51,348 --> 00:49:56,127
Oh, we made it! We're
finally going to get home!

946
00:49:56,152 --> 00:49:57,192
Oh no....

947
00:49:57,217 --> 00:49:59,911
These facts and opinions look...so similar.

948

Don't worry about it.
Happens all the time!

949
00:50:06,521 --> 00:50:09,335
On a scale of 1 to 10,
I give this day an "F."

950
00:50:09,360 --> 00:50:12,234
Well, why don't we quit standing
around, and do something!

951
00:50:12,259 --> 00:50:15,543
- Like what, genius?
- Like quitting! That's what I'm doing.

952
00:50:15,568 --> 00:50:20,668
Sure, it's the coward's way out.
But this cowards gonna survive.

953
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:29,696
Emotions can't quit, genius.

954
00:50:30,295 --> 00:50:33,569
Ugh! I thought we're
suppose to be keeping Riley happy?

955
00:50:33,598 --> 00:50:36,106
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute!

956

Ah-ha!
Ho ho ho...

- What is it?
- Oh nothing.

958
00:50:42,650 --> 00:50:44,888
- Just the best idea ever.
- What?

959
00:50:44,913 --> 00:50:47,621
All the good Core Memories
were made in Minnesota.

960
00:50:47,646 --> 00:50:50,736
Ergo, we go back to Minnesota
and make more.

961
00:50:50,761 --> 00:50:51,896
- Ta-dah.
- Wait wait wait.

962
00:50:51,921 --> 00:50:53,907
You're say we
run away?

963
00:50:53,932 --> 00:50:55,326
Well, I wouldn't call it that.

964
00:50:55,351 --> 00:50:58,161
I call it the "Happy Core
Memory Development Program."

965
00:50:58,186 --> 00:51:00,766
- You can't be serious!
- Hey, our life was perfect.

966

Until Mom and Dad decided to
move to San Fran stink-town.

967
00:51:05,028 --> 00:51:07,029
But, I-I-I mean.
It's just so...drastic.

968
00:51:07,054 --> 00:51:09,545
Need I remind you of how
great things were there.

969
00:51:09,570 --> 00:51:13,331

Anyway, it was better.
That's my point.

973
00:51:19,635 --> 00:51:23,030
- Yeah, Riley was happier in Minnesota.
- Wait. Hold on.

974
00:51:23,055 --> 00:51:24,715
Should we just sleep
on this or something?

975
00:51:24,740 --> 00:51:26,225
Fine, let's sleep on it.

Hey hey.
Why aren't we moving?

Riley's gone to sleep.
We're all on break.

You mean we're stuck
here until morning?

Yeah. The Train of Thought

01:18:21,522 --> 01:18:24,939
- That worked.
- Well, what would you do if you're so smart!?

1355
01:18:24,964 --> 01:18:28,072
I'd tell you, but you're 
too dumb to understand.

1356
01:18:28,097 --> 01:18:30,350
- WHAT!?
- Of course your tiny brain is confused.

1357
01:18:30,375 --> 01:18:33,390
Guess I'll just have to dumb it
down to your level.

1358
01:18:33,415 --> 01:18:36,890
Sorry I don't speak moron
as well as you. But let me try.

1359
01:18:36,914 --> 01:18:38,315
Duh...

1360
01:18:38,340 --> 01:18:44,620
AHHHH!!!

1361
01:18:47,205 --> 01:18:48,749
Oh, thank goodness you're back!

1362
01:18:48,774 --> 01:18:50,837
- Things are really messed up.
- We-we-we found this idea.

1363
01:18:50,862 --> 01:18:52,360
Oh no.

1364
01:19:02,309 --> 01:19:03,929
Joy, you got to fix this!
Get out there!

1365
01:19:03,955 --> 01:19:06,401
- Sadness, it's up to you.
- Me?

1366
01:19:06,426 --> 01:19:08,306
( All ) Sadness?

1367
01:19:08,334 --> 01:19:10,518
- I can't, Joy.
- Yes you can.

1368
01:19:10,543 --> 01:19:13,095
Riley needs you.

1369
01:19:24,205 --> 01:19:25,627
Okay...

1370
01:19:45,791 --> 01:19:48,999
Wait! Stop!
I want to get off!

1371
01:19:59,873 --> 01:20:01,732
Alright, thank you, we will.

1372
01:20:01,757 --> 01:20:04,608
- Her teacher hasn't even seen Riley all day.
- What?

1373
01:20:04,633 --> 01:20:05,829
What was she wearing last?

1374
01:20:05,854 --> 01:20:07,471
- Can't believe this.
- Do you even remember what...

1375
01:20:07,561 --> 01:20:08,779
- Riley!
- Hey. There you are!

1376
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:09,978
- Thank goodness.
- Oh, we were worried sick.

1377
01:20:10,006 --> 01:20:11,866
Where have you been? It's so late!

1378
01:20:11,891 --> 01:20:14,542
Riley, what happened?
Are you alright.

1379
01:21:33,066 --> 01:21:35,066
<i>( Crying )</i>

1380
01:21:43,794 --> 01:21:47,280
I-I know you don't want me to, but...

1381
01:21:48,424 --> 01:21:50,754
I miss home.

1382
01:21:51,640 --> 01:21:54,185
I miss Minnesota.

1383
01:21:56,896 --> 01:21:59,524
You need me to be happy.

1384
01:21:59,549 --> 01:22:00,900
But...

1385
01:22:01,855 --> 01:22:04,649
I want my old friends

1386
01:22:04,674 --> 01:22:07,333
and my hockey team

1387
01:22:08,737 --> 01:22:10,918
I want to go home.

1388
01:22:12,199 --> 01:22:14,639
Please don't be mad.

1389
01:22:16,933 --> 01:22:20,425
- Oh, sweetie...
- We're not mad.

1390
01:22:21,358 --> 01:22:25,779
You know what?
I miss Minnesota too.

1391
01:22:26,655 --> 01:22:30,119
I miss the woods
that we took hikes.

1392
01:22:30,241 --> 01:22:33,248
And the backyard where
you used to play.

1393
01:22:33,273 --> 01:22:34,729
Spring lake.

1394
01:22:34,754 --> 01:22:37,546
Where you learned to skate.

1395
01:22:38,433 --> 01:22:40,071
Come here.

Hey, I'm liking this new view.

1398
01:24:02,488 --> 01:24:04,027
Friendship Island has expanded.

1399
01:24:04,052 --> 01:24:06,683
Glad they finally opened that
friendly argument section.

1400
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:08,787
I like Tragic Vampire Romance Island.

1401

Fashion Island...
<i>( Gasp )</i> Everyone shut up!

1402
01:24:11,634 --> 01:24:13,772
Boy Band Island?
Hope that's just a phase...

1403
01:24:13,797 --> 01:24:17,941
Say what you want.
I think it's all beautiful.

1404
01:24:17,966 --> 01:24:19,236
Alright, here you go.

1405
01:24:19,261 --> 01:24:22,305
Your new expanded console

1406
01:24:22,333 --> 01:24:23,794
- Whoa.
- Wow.

1407
01:24:23,819 --> 01:24:25,119
- Cool. Upgrade.
- Woo.

1408
01:24:25,144 --> 01:24:27,566
Aye, ho ho.
Whoops, did I just do that?

Wait, guys, whats 'pooberty?'

1410
01:24:30,322 --> 01:24:32,327
I don't know...
It's probably not important.

Whoa. I have access to the
entire curse word library!

1412

Sorry, I did it again. My bad.

1414
01:24:41,473 --> 01:24:43,294
They're getting to the rink.

1415
01:24:43,781 --> 01:24:45,953
Now, when you get out there!
You be aggressive!

1416
01:24:45,978 --> 01:24:47,592
- I know, Dad.
- Not too aggressive.

1417
01:24:47,617 --> 01:24:50,453
You know, you guys don't have
to come to every game.

1418
01:24:50,478 --> 01:24:52,630
Are you kidding?
I'm not missing one!

1419
01:24:52,655 --> 01:24:54,417
- Go Fog Horns!
- Go Riley!

1420
01:24:54,442 --> 01:24:55,712
- Fog.. Horns...
- Okay okay.

1421
01:24:55,737 --> 01:24:57,506
I got to go.

1422
01:24:58,331 --> 01:25:00,242
- Oh.
- They love us.

1423
01:25:00,267 --> 01:25:01,946
Yeah, Mom and Dad
are pretty cool.

1424
01:25:01,971 --> 01:25:05,493
Guys, of course they are.
But we can't show it.

1426
01:25:06,741 --> 01:25:08,114
She loved the face painting.

1427
01:25:08,139 --> 01:25:10,559
Told you it was a great idea.

1428
01:25:10,718 --> 01:25:14,217
- Best idea he's had in a while!
- He's a really good guy.

Oh.

Sorry.

GIRL!

Uhhh...Okay, bye.

1436
01:25:40,422 --> 01:25:42,312
Hey Riley.

1437
01:25:45,570 --> 01:25:47,317
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1438
01:25:47,345 --> 01:25:50,832
Alright. Let's play some hockey!

- Alright, Anger. Take over.
- Give us that puck or you're dead meat!

On her left.
On her left!

Let's just try not to get
all smelly this time.

Oh, Mom and Dad
are watching us fail.

Not for long!

We've been through a lot
lately that's for sure.

1445
01:26:03,288 --> 01:26:05,486
But we still love our girl.

1446
01:26:05,514 --> 01:26:08,070
She has great new friends,
a great new house.

1447

Things couldn't be better!

After all, Riley is 12 now.

What could happen?

1450
01:26:34,560 --> 01:26:38,238
And who can tell me what year
San Francisco was founded?

1451
01:26:38,263 --> 01:26:39,768
Anyone?

1452
01:26:39,792 --> 01:26:42,341
- Jordan?
- Uhhh...

1453
01:26:42,713 --> 01:26:44,029
How much more of this?

1454
01:26:44,062 --> 01:26:48,082
5 months, 2 weeks, and 4 days,
until summer vacation.

Then it's off to the Bahamas

We are a total fraud!
Do you think they can see through us?

Of course not, we're
