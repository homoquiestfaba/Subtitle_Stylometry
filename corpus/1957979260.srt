Oh, yeah. Hey, guys,
that was a great show.

60
00:03:05,620 --> 00:03:07,424
- Thank you.
- Hey, I got a little something for you.

61

- There you go.
- Thank you.

62
00:03:10,364 --> 00:03:11,669
How much did we make?

63

- A gift certificate?

66
00:03:21,853 --> 00:03:23,812
Yeah. Can I help you?

67
00:03:23,942 --> 00:03:26,641
Um, yeah, so we were told

68
00:03:26,771 --> 00:03:28,991
that we were gonna be
compensated for the show.

69
00:03:29,121 --> 00:03:31,123
Well, yeah.
Got that free coupon

70
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:34,475
and, you know,
the hotel room. Right?

71
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:37,260
Mm... We just
were hoping for...

72
00:03:38,957 --> 00:03:40,611
monetary compensation.

73
00:03:40,742 --> 00:03:42,700
Well, Dave, we...
We're a not-for-profit.

74
00:03:42,831 --> 00:03:44,354
There's no cash in the budget.

75
00:03:44,485 --> 00:03:47,966
What about, um, all the
money raised from the run?

76
00:03:48,097 --> 00:03:49,620
Well, that goes
to our cause. Right?

77
00:03:49,751 --> 00:03:52,667
I mean, you guys are
compensated by your exposure.

78
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:54,408
Mr. Smith,
I'm sorry, no offense,

79
00:03:54,538 --> 00:03:58,063
but we just played
for four hours.

80
00:03:58,194 --> 00:04:01,328
That's, um, less than two
dollars an hour for each of us.

81
00:04:01,458 --> 00:04:04,461
Yeah. Well, okay.
Just a second.

82
00:04:04,592 --> 00:04:05,952
I don't normally do this,
you know,

83
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:08,204
but, you know,
that's a donation.

84
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:12,034
So here, let me get something
from my wallet for you here.

85
00:04:12,164 --> 00:04:14,384
Hold on one second.
One second...

86
00:04:16,038 --> 00:04:17,953
Just one second.

87
00:04:18,083 --> 00:04:19,650
Just got... Oh, there it is.

88
00:04:19,781 --> 00:04:21,783
Here you go.

89
00:04:21,913 --> 00:04:24,525
Ten cents off a gallon of gas.

90
00:04:26,744 --> 00:04:28,442
At least these are good.

91
00:04:28,572 --> 00:04:31,140
I'm glad, 'cause those two bites

92
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:33,925
are worth a half hour
of work each.

93
00:04:36,711 --> 00:04:39,670
You think that the bank will
let us deposit the gas coupon?

94
00:04:39,801 --> 00:04:41,019
See, that's the other thing.

95
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:44,022
Joe, this van gets
terrible gas mileage.

96
00:04:44,153 --> 00:04:45,285
We have to get rid of it.

97
00:04:45,415 --> 00:04:48,331

about her like that.

Oh.

00:07:48,903 --> 00:07:52,210
- I didn't recognize you with the makeup.
- Makeup. Right.

156
00:07:52,341 --> 00:07:55,910
Um... I haven't seen you
since graduation.

157
00:07:56,040 --> 00:07:57,389
- How-how ya doin'?
- Good.

158

Good.

Bye.

just saw me perform.

169
00:08:41,085 --> 00:08:42,870
that you used to be
close with, right?

170
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:46,917
Weren't you, like, trying to
convince him to not do music?

171
00:08:47,048 --> 00:08:49,833
- Yes.
- Guess he didn't listen.

172
00:08:49,964 --> 00:08:51,966
Obviously, you didn't either.

173
00:08:52,096 --> 00:08:53,794
Good thing, too.

174
00:08:53,924 --> 00:08:55,535
Can we just go, please?

175
00:08:59,800 --> 00:09:02,890
I guess we're going. Again.

176
00:09:12,029 --> 00:09:13,204
Is this it?

177
00:09:16,207 --> 00:09:17,818
It's the right address.

178
00:09:19,994 --> 00:09:22,300
I don't know
about this. Um...

179
00:09:22,431 --> 00:09:23,606
We could sleep in the van.

180
00:09:25,608 --> 00:09:27,958
- Maybe they have breakfast.
- - Danny.

181
00:09:34,791 --> 00:09:37,228
So, we don't have a TV.

182
00:10:20,315 --> 00:10:21,403
Living the dream.

183
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:27,757
- Yep.
- Yeah.

184
00:10:32,806 --> 00:10:34,895
- Listen, I'm sorry about earlier.
- What?

185
00:10:35,025 --> 00:10:36,853
I'm-I'm sorry about earlier.

186
00:10:36,984 --> 00:10:38,986
Oh, no, that's... It's all good.

187
00:10:57,352 --> 00:11:00,050
I guess the, um...

188
00:11:00,181 --> 00:11:03,445
the silver lining
of playing for tacos and...

189
00:11:05,012 --> 00:11:08,668
staying in grungy motels in
the middle of nowhere is, um...

190
00:11:11,322 --> 00:11:13,324
you get to see the stars.

191
00:11:16,414 --> 00:11:19,679
Amie, you were so... Like,
you never spoke in class,

192
00:11:19,809 --> 00:11:21,855
and all of a sudden,
you're this rock star.

193
00:11:21,985 --> 00:11:23,595
Why does that make you smiley?

194
00:11:23,726 --> 00:11:26,120
'Cause that's great... I mean,
when did that happen?

195
00:11:27,991 --> 00:11:30,211
Um, like two years ago.

196
00:11:30,341 --> 00:11:32,256
Two years? Seriously?

197
00:11:32,387 --> 00:11:34,519
Yeah, Charlie convinced me, I...

198
00:11:35,695 --> 00:11:37,784
So, then, Mr. Boyfriend knew,
huh?

199
00:11:37,914 --> 00:11:41,135
No. He didn't.

200
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:43,615
Really?

201
00:11:43,746 --> 00:11:46,183
Yeah, he would have
made my life miserable.

202
00:11:46,314 --> 00:11:47,834
Telling you your dreams
aren't worth it

203
00:11:47,881 --> 00:11:50,144
and maybe you shouldn't
follow your passion?

204
00:11:50,274 --> 00:11:53,190
- Can we not talk about ex-boyfriends...
- Yeah, yeah.

205
00:11:53,321 --> 00:11:56,541
- Girlfriends, any of that...
- We don't have to... Yeah.

206
00:11:56,672 --> 00:12:00,197
What do you want to talk about?

207
00:12:00,328 --> 00:12:01,459
Um...

208
00:12:03,070 --> 00:12:08,771
What's your favorite
classic movie?

209
00:12:08,902 --> 00:12:11,556
Whoa. Okay.

210
00:12:11,687 --> 00:12:13,297
Uh...

211
00:12:13,428 --> 00:12:14,690
Oh! Jurassic Park.

212
00:12:14,821 --> 00:12:16,431
A hundred percent,
Jurassic Park.

213
00:12:16,561 --> 00:12:18,041
The old one, right?

214
00:12:19,477 --> 00:12:21,784
- What?
- The old one.

215
00:12:21,915 --> 00:12:23,264
There's a new one?

216
00:12:23,394 --> 00:12:25,222
- Yes.
- No.

217
00:12:25,353 --> 00:12:27,572
- You haven't seen it?
- No!

218
00:12:27,703 --> 00:12:29,531
- It's pretty good.
- No, it's not.

219
00:12:29,661 --> 00:12:30,967
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

220
00:12:31,098 --> 00:12:33,187
- Yes, it is.
- No, it's not.

221
00:12:39,367 --> 00:12:40,672
- No.
- Oh, okay. All right.

222
00:12:41,978 --> 00:12:43,850
Speaking of which,

223
00:12:43,980 --> 00:12:45,895
- have you seen our van?
- Yes, I have.

224
00:12:46,026 --> 00:12:48,134
- You've seen this van?
- Yes, I saw it in the parking lot.

225
00:12:48,158 --> 00:12:50,813
- But have you seen it with the new decal?
- Wow.

226
00:12:50,944 --> 00:12:53,207
No, I have not seen this.

227
00:12:53,337 --> 00:12:54,774
Whose is this?

228
00:12:54,904 --> 00:12:57,602
- Uh, that's Joe's.
- Classic.

229
00:12:57,733 --> 00:13:00,453
- What do you mean, "classic"?
- It just would be Joe's. I don't know.

230
00:13:00,518 --> 00:13:02,651
Could be mine. So are you
living in a single, too?

231
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:06,133
No. We've got
a double queen in the room.

232
00:13:06,263 --> 00:13:08,004
We're literally
sleeping in the same bed.

233
00:13:08,135 --> 00:13:09,135
No. No.

234
00:13:09,223 --> 00:13:10,746
I actually woke up with Joe's...

235
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:13,488
You don't wanna...
On my face.

236
00:13:16,752 --> 00:13:18,232
- So, I...
- Do you remember?

237
00:13:20,103 --> 00:13:21,844
Do you remember?

238
00:13:23,977 --> 00:13:25,108
Do you?

239
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:27,502
Yes. Of course.

240
00:13:30,984 --> 00:13:32,463
Yeah. See?

241
00:13:32,594 --> 00:13:33,987
- You had it.
- Still got it.

242
00:13:36,554 --> 00:13:39,906
Well, on that note,
sweet dreams.

243
00:13:55,530 --> 00:13:56,748
See ya.

244
00:14:08,282 --> 00:14:10,197
Now who's late for curfew?

245
00:14:10,327 --> 00:14:12,373
- Tell us everything.
- Everything.

246
00:14:12,503 --> 00:14:13,504
Um...

247
00:14:16,333 --> 00:14:18,031
I don't know.

248
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,087
That bed was terrible.

249
00:14:31,218 --> 00:14:34,308
Between your elbows in my face,
and the broken spring...

250
00:14:34,438 --> 00:14:36,223
Cockroaches?

251
00:14:36,353 --> 00:14:37,920
We should've slept in the van.

252
00:14:39,226 --> 00:14:41,358
Guys, I can't believe
how well that show went.

253
00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:43,099
I know, but that motel sucked.

254
00:14:43,230 --> 00:14:45,406
I mean, at least
they had mints, right?

255
00:14:45,536 --> 00:14:47,190
Lucy, I don't think
that's a mint.

256
00:14:48,539 --> 00:14:50,759
Oh, my...

257
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:53,283
What is that ridiculous
smile on your face?

258
00:14:53,414 --> 00:14:54,850
Me? What?

259
00:14:54,981 --> 00:14:56,852
Considering where
we just stayed the night,

260
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:59,159
you're looking awfully smiley.

261
00:14:59,289 --> 00:15:01,988
- I smell like an ashtray.
- Me, too.

262
00:15:02,118 --> 00:15:04,294
- Why didn't you shower?
- I did shower.

263
00:15:04,425 --> 00:15:07,819
- You showered in there?
- It was not that bad.

264
00:15:07,950 --> 00:15:09,647
Okay, you were barely there.

265
00:15:12,650 --> 00:15:15,175
No, I just... I couldn't...
I couldn't sleep,

266
00:15:15,305 --> 00:15:17,742
so I just went out
and got some fresh air.

267
00:15:17,873 --> 00:15:19,570
Oh, so that's her name?

268
00:15:19,701 --> 00:15:20,745
What? Amie?

269
00:15:22,182 --> 00:15:25,141
I knew it. I knew it.
Oh, look at you.

270
00:15:25,272 --> 00:15:27,622
If he hurts you,
I will destroy him.

271
00:15:27,752 --> 00:15:30,146
We will destroy him.
Got it?

272
00:15:34,498 --> 00:15:36,326
Bye.

273
00:15:44,595 --> 00:15:46,467
Hey, honey. How are you?

274
00:15:46,597 --> 00:15:48,382
- I'm good.
- Are you tired?

275
00:15:48,512 --> 00:15:50,210
Oh, yeah.

276
00:15:50,340 --> 00:15:51,951
- Oh, hi.
- Look at him.

277
00:15:52,081 --> 00:15:53,256
He missed you. Him sad.

278
00:15:53,387 --> 00:15:56,433
So, how was it?
Tell me all about it.

279
00:15:56,564 --> 00:15:58,044
- It was really good.
- Was it fun?

280
00:15:58,174 --> 00:15:59,543
- It was really, really good.
- It was a good time?

281
00:15:59,567 --> 00:16:01,786
- We played for four hours.
- Four hours.

282
00:16:01,917 --> 00:16:03,745
- Yeah.
- That's a long time to play, isn't it?

283
00:16:03,875 --> 00:16:04,964
- Yeah.
- Wow.

284
00:16:05,094 --> 00:16:06,704
Everybody was, like,
jogging at first,

285
00:16:06,835 --> 00:16:08,682
not really paying attention,
but then, like, nearing the end,

286
00:16:08,706 --> 00:16:10,336
like, people really started
paying attention

287
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:14,103
and, like, dancing and,
like, going up to the stage

288
00:16:14,234 --> 00:16:16,018
and like...

289
00:16:16,149 --> 00:16:18,170
I don't know, I thought I saw
some people singing along...

290
00:16:18,194 --> 00:16:19,543
They're like your fans.

291
00:16:19,674 --> 00:16:22,198
No, I mean, we have people
who like our music.

292
00:16:22,329 --> 00:16:24,169
- Your band has fans.
- No, we don't have fans.

293
00:16:24,287 --> 00:16:27,334
- You do. I'm your fan.
- You're my mom.

294
00:16:27,464 --> 00:16:29,162
- I'm your fan.
- You're my mom.

295
00:16:29,292 --> 00:16:31,991
I know. How did
the other boys like it?

296
00:16:32,121 --> 00:16:34,776
Joe, actually,
was really good this time.

297
00:16:34,906 --> 00:16:36,952
- Joe plays drums.
- Yeah.

298
00:16:37,083 --> 00:16:39,259
Joe's the drummer.
Danny plays guitar.

299
00:16:39,389 --> 00:16:41,609
No. Danny plays bass.
I'm guitar.

300
00:16:41,739 --> 00:16:43,567
They're guitars.
They're both guitars to me.

301
00:16:43,698 --> 00:16:48,050
- Um, how was the hotel?
- Nasty.

302
00:16:48,181 --> 00:16:50,139
It wasn't even a hotel.
It was like a motel.

303
00:16:50,270 --> 00:16:51,706
- Really?
- Like-like...

304
00:16:51,836 --> 00:16:55,362
I mean, that's how we got paid.
That and tacos.

305
00:16:55,492 --> 00:16:56,624
I'm sorry.

306
00:16:57,799 --> 00:17:01,150
It won't always be
nasty motels and tacos.

307
00:17:01,281 --> 00:17:02,369
I promise you.

308
00:17:02,499 --> 00:17:04,414
Is this your, uh, dirty laundry?

309
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:06,808
Yeah.

310
00:17:06,938 --> 00:17:09,419
Take it to the laundry room
instead of here on the counter.

311
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:12,944
Yes. Sorry.

312
00:17:27,307 --> 00:17:30,701
Oh... Look at you guys
Clark Kenting it.

313
00:17:30,832 --> 00:17:32,225
You really just gotta own it.

314
00:17:32,355 --> 00:17:36,794
I do, just...
not in front of Amie's mom.

315
00:17:36,925 --> 00:17:39,362
Yeah, well, with me,
she gets what she gets.

316
00:17:39,493 --> 00:17:41,190
Besides, your mom loves me.

317
00:17:45,542 --> 00:17:47,370
She does love me, right?

318
00:17:47,501 --> 00:17:48,545
Yeah.

319
00:17:49,938 --> 00:17:53,376
All right. Let's go.

320
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,913
Do not say a word.

321
00:18:10,045 --> 00:18:12,352
I'm home.

322
00:18:12,482 --> 00:18:13,962
- Hi.
- Hey, Mom.

323
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:15,181
Hi, Nikki.

324
00:18:17,618 --> 00:18:21,970
So, how was the college visit?

325
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:24,364
Went really well.
It was good.

326
00:18:26,322 --> 00:18:29,020
Oh, I wanted to remind you to bake
the cupcakes for the bake sale.

327
00:18:29,151 --> 00:18:32,894
- Yes. Yeah.
- It's just that the volunteer hours

328
00:18:33,024 --> 00:18:35,070
are so important for
the scholarship applications.

329
00:18:36,506 --> 00:18:39,030
Yes. Um, thank you.

330
00:18:40,510 --> 00:18:42,643
Right, Lucy?

331
00:18:42,773 --> 00:18:43,948
Yeah.

332
00:18:44,079 --> 00:18:46,386
College is...
It's-it's so important.

333
00:18:46,516 --> 00:18:48,779
Yeah. It is.

334
00:18:52,043 --> 00:18:55,134
Charlie, I didn't know
you were back already.

335
00:18:55,264 --> 00:18:57,223
Yeah, I came in a day early.

336
00:18:59,529 --> 00:19:03,229
Um, we're gonna go to my room,
but I love you.

337
00:19:03,359 --> 00:19:05,535
- Good to see you.
- Bye.

338
00:19:26,077 --> 00:19:27,862
- Hey.
- Hey.

339
00:19:27,992 --> 00:19:29,255
Hi.

340
00:19:30,995 --> 00:19:34,347
So, uh, any idea
what time it is?

341
00:19:34,477 --> 00:19:36,392
No, but I know I'm early.

342
00:19:36,523 --> 00:19:39,134
- It's 12:30.
- Whoa! Geez.

343
00:19:39,265 --> 00:19:41,005
You're the only person I know

344
00:19:41,136 --> 00:19:42,461
who can be late
from the parking lot.

345
00:19:42,485 --> 00:19:44,139
Yeah. It's a gift, really.

346
00:19:44,270 --> 00:19:46,533
Hmm. So...

347
00:19:48,709 --> 00:19:50,276
Oh, yeah! Okay.

348
00:19:50,406 --> 00:19:52,191
You got it. Yep.

349
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:53,627
What about your...

350
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:58,109
It's okay. I can do this.

351
00:19:58,240 --> 00:19:59,415
Okay.

352
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:05,073
Oh! That's interesting.

353
00:20:29,053 --> 00:20:32,013
Hi, uh, welcome to Cinema 10.
How can I help you?

354
00:20:32,143 --> 00:20:35,190
Okay. I've got table six,
large supreme, hold the pep.

355
00:20:35,321 --> 00:20:38,193
Table six, large supreme,
hold the pep. You got it.

356
00:20:38,324 --> 00:20:39,150
Coming right up.

357
00:20:39,281 --> 00:20:40,804
I'm sorry.

358
00:20:42,980 --> 00:20:45,113
- Tonya, I'm sorry...
- It's Taylor.

359
00:20:45,244 --> 00:20:47,985
Taylor, right, uh...
Taylor, sorry.

360
00:20:48,116 --> 00:20:49,160
- Um...
- It's okay.

361
00:20:49,291 --> 00:20:52,163
I just...
ooh, had a late night.

362
00:20:56,342 --> 00:20:58,518
Nice of you to join us.
Where were you?

363
00:20:58,648 --> 00:21:01,042
I didn't realize it would be
this busy on a Tuesday.

364
00:21:01,172 --> 00:21:04,175
Didn't you get Dad's text?
The tournaments are in town.

365
00:21:07,483 --> 00:21:09,006
You're late.

366
00:21:09,137 --> 00:21:11,289
Hey, Sparky, you got that pie
for table three for me yet?

367
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:13,054
What'd you just call me?

368
00:21:13,184 --> 00:21:14,664
New nickname thing
I'm trying out.

369
00:21:14,795 --> 00:21:16,381
I don't know if you know
what the Color Dash 5K is,

370
00:21:16,405 --> 00:21:17,765
- but it's like this huge...
- Dave.

371
00:21:17,798 --> 00:21:20,235
- Yes.
- Stop wasting your time.

372
00:21:20,366 --> 00:21:23,543
- Ooh, Peppy Joe. Lana, Sam...
- No.

373
00:21:23,673 --> 00:21:24,935
What about Nitro?

374
00:21:25,066 --> 00:21:27,460
- Why? - 'Cause your
kinda cool and smooth.

375
00:21:27,590 --> 00:21:30,463
Oh, okay. Okay.
I like that one.

376
00:21:30,593 --> 00:21:32,856
Can't pay your rent on tacos.

377
00:21:35,032 --> 00:21:36,251
Dude.

378
00:21:44,651 --> 00:21:46,783
Look at my best friends
waiting for me.

379
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:48,239
I thought you were
at the mechanic.

380
00:21:48,263 --> 00:21:49,525
Did that just backfire?

381
00:21:50,613 --> 00:21:52,180
Are we gonna practice or what?

382
00:21:53,355 --> 00:21:54,443
Shotgun!

383
00:21:59,100 --> 00:22:00,971
What's the first thing
on the agenda?

384
00:22:02,582 --> 00:22:05,149
Our paperwork was received
at Battle of the Bands.

385
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:07,064
- Thank you.
- Yes.

386
00:22:07,195 --> 00:22:10,807
Also, the girls are competing.

387
00:22:14,898 --> 00:22:16,639
We're not taking it
easy on them.

388
00:22:16,770 --> 00:22:18,119
What? No.
Nobody said that.

389
00:22:18,249 --> 00:22:20,208
That's not what
I'm worried about.

390
00:22:20,339 --> 00:22:21,427
What are you worried about?

391
00:22:23,211 --> 00:22:25,692
Half Past Midnight.
Yeah, they're competing.

392
00:22:25,822 --> 00:22:28,142
What? Half Past Midnight cannot
play at Battle of the Bands.

393
00:22:28,259 --> 00:22:29,435
- That's unfair.
- I know.

394
00:22:29,565 --> 00:22:31,205
They've won the last three years
in a row.

395
00:22:31,262 --> 00:22:33,066
If we don't step up our game,
that's gonna be...

396
00:22:33,090 --> 00:22:34,614
I'm not scared of them.

397
00:22:34,744 --> 00:22:37,530
We've worked way too hard
for them to beat us.

398
00:22:37,660 --> 00:22:40,576
Whoa. Okay. Where did
this Danny come from?

399
00:22:40,707 --> 00:22:43,100
Man, I'm done
scooping ice cream!

400
00:22:43,231 --> 00:22:45,233
You know if I quit, we
don't get free pizza, right?

401
00:22:45,364 --> 00:22:47,080
- That's like all we eat.
- Yeah, but if we win,

402
00:22:47,104 --> 00:22:48,279
then we can afford pizza.

403
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:52,936
- I second that idea. All right.
- We have to kill it.

404
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:55,187
We have to make sure we get
a spot on The Warped Tour.

405
00:22:55,243 --> 00:22:58,159
You know what? I second that, too.
Do we have a third?

406
00:22:58,289 --> 00:23:00,857
- We have a third.
- All right. We've all hit me.

407
00:23:00,988 --> 00:23:02,946
Second: mail.

408
00:23:07,864 --> 00:23:09,213
Mail.

409
00:23:09,344 --> 00:23:12,782
Give me a record deal.

410
00:23:12,913 --> 00:23:14,480
"We regret to inform you..."

411
00:23:14,610 --> 00:23:16,743
I want an agent.

412
00:23:16,873 --> 00:23:18,397
No, this is life insurance.

413
00:23:21,922 --> 00:23:23,750
"You need to work
on your charisma."

414
00:23:23,880 --> 00:23:27,493
"Dear Summertime Dropouts,
you're not good enough."

415
00:23:31,410 --> 00:23:33,368
You know what, we'll just...

416
00:23:33,499 --> 00:23:35,912
We'll just build our stage on rejection
letters. That's what we'll do.

417
00:23:35,936 --> 00:23:38,591
They can tell us no
as many times as they want to,

418
00:23:38,721 --> 00:23:40,462
but we're not giving up.

419
00:23:41,681 --> 00:23:43,465
- Hey, Joe.
- Yeah.

420
00:23:43,596 --> 00:23:46,990
Do your magical free pizza
powers apply to delivery?

421
00:23:47,121 --> 00:23:48,427
Of course.

422
00:23:48,557 --> 00:23:52,779
Guys! That was
a moment. Like...

423
00:23:52,909 --> 00:23:55,129
"They're not gonna
tell us no." Song.

424
00:23:55,259 --> 00:23:57,566
Like... band. We get together.

425
00:23:57,697 --> 00:24:00,482
We play songs...
You didn't feel that?

426
00:24:00,613 --> 00:24:02,049
- No.
- What?

427
00:24:02,179 --> 00:24:03,354
Just, can we practice, please?

428
00:24:04,791 --> 00:24:05,791
Yeah.

- What? Are you okay?
- No, I am unwell.

00:25:14,904 --> 00:25:17,211
No, I mean, do whatever, just...

449
00:25:17,341 --> 00:25:20,040
Let's just ask each other the first
question that comes to your mind.

450
00:25:20,170 --> 00:25:21,476
Okay,

451
00:25:21,607 --> 00:25:25,219
if you had to do
something other than music,

452
00:25:25,349 --> 00:25:27,134
what would it be?

453
00:25:27,264 --> 00:25:28,962
- Graphic design.
- Veterinarian.

454
00:25:29,092 --> 00:25:31,312
Amie, you're allergic to cats.

455
00:25:31,442 --> 00:25:33,575
- You physically cannot do that.
- Can you imagine?

456
00:25:33,706 --> 00:25:35,751
It would just be
a constant sneeze attack.

457
00:25:35,882 --> 00:25:38,058
Wow.

458
00:25:38,188 --> 00:25:40,016
What about you?

459
00:25:40,147 --> 00:25:41,777
If I had to do something
other than music?

460
00:25:41,801 --> 00:25:44,368
- Yes.
- I...

461
00:25:44,499 --> 00:25:46,283
There... I don't think
there's anything else.

462
00:25:46,414 --> 00:25:47,807
What? It was your question.

463
00:25:47,937 --> 00:25:49,896
I know, but honestly
I don't think I'd be happy

464
00:25:50,026 --> 00:25:51,985
- doing anything else.
- Touché.

465
00:25:52,115 --> 00:25:54,553
Well, I guess you have
to make it happen.

466
00:25:54,683 --> 00:25:56,163
I will. We will.

467
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:57,686
We will. You're right.

468
00:26:02,212 --> 00:26:03,474
Do you guys wanna add more?

469
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:04,998
- Absolutely.
- Look at her heart.

470
00:26:05,128 --> 00:26:08,218
- It got painted over.
- Oh, yeah, we have to redo it.

471
00:26:08,349 --> 00:26:10,612
- Redo the...
- We must mark our territory.

472
00:26:12,962 --> 00:26:14,137
Check the Battle website.

473
00:26:15,922 --> 00:26:17,445
Competing bands.

474
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:20,143
- Wait, wait, what's this right here?
- What?

00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:21,971
Kevin Lyman.

476
00:26:23,756 --> 00:26:25,627
"It will be bittersweet
each morning

477
00:26:25,758 --> 00:26:28,151
when I see the sunrise
and then watch it set."

478
00:26:29,500 --> 00:26:30,806
Wait.

479
00:26:31,807 --> 00:26:34,505
- Um...
- Stop, stop, stop, stop.

480
00:26:34,636 --> 00:26:37,291
"The enduring spirit
of the Vans Warped Tour

481

489
00:27:07,538 --> 00:27:09,976
They're canceling Warped Tour.

490
00:27:26,340 --> 00:27:28,124
Those are very black.

491
00:27:28,255 --> 00:27:29,604
I'm putting
pink glitter on them.

492
00:27:29,735 --> 00:27:31,519
Please do not
disturb my process.

493
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:33,802
You know, the only shame is
that you won't be there to see

494
00:27:33,826 --> 00:27:36,829
when all the kids' teeth
turn black.

495
00:27:36,959 --> 00:27:38,439
I didn't think about that.

496
00:27:41,007 --> 00:27:42,922
- Um, no, Charlie, no.
- This is Charlie.

497
00:27:43,052 --> 00:27:44,706
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Can you just...

498
00:27:44,837 --> 00:27:47,317
Hi, Charlie. Um, sorry,
I thought this was Amie's phone.

499
00:27:47,448 --> 00:27:49,406
It is. Hi.

500
00:27:49,537 --> 00:27:51,974
Hey, uh, so,

501
00:27:52,105 --> 00:27:54,063
did you guys hear?

502
00:27:54,194 --> 00:27:55,456
Hear what?

503
00:27:55,586 --> 00:27:58,024
They're canceling
The Warped Tour.

504
00:27:58,154 --> 00:28:01,157
So this is the last chance we're
gonna have to play on The Warped Tour.

505
00:28:01,288 --> 00:28:03,179
- Can I help you with that pink glitter?
- Yes, please.

506
00:28:03,203 --> 00:28:04,334
- Awesome.
- Please do.

507
00:28:04,465 --> 00:28:06,032
You know, the-the warped zoo.

508
00:28:06,162 --> 00:28:08,774
Hello?

509
00:28:11,472 --> 00:28:13,343
They took that well.

510
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:19,132
Metalheads, riot
girls and punks,

511
00:28:19,262 --> 00:28:21,047
what's up
and welcome to the finals

512
00:28:21,177 --> 00:28:23,876
of The Battle of Bands:
Warped Tour Edition.

513
00:28:24,006 --> 00:28:26,748
Each band tonight will be judged
and scored on multiple categories.

514
00:28:26,879 --> 00:28:28,968
The band with the highest
overall score

515
00:28:29,098 --> 00:28:32,319
will go on to join

All right, guys.

730
00:41:49,681 --> 00:41:52,727
All of you bands did
absolutely amazing tonight.

731
00:41:52,858 --> 00:41:56,296
But only one of you gets to take
the final spot on The Warped Tour,

732
00:41:56,426 --> 00:41:59,299
and the results are in.

733
00:41:59,429 --> 00:42:01,780
This year's winner
of The Battle of the Bands:

734
00:42:01,910 --> 00:42:04,522
Warped Tour Edition is...

735
00:42:04,652 --> 00:42:09,701
For the fourth time in a row,
Half Past Midnight!

736
00:42:09,831 --> 00:42:11,833
Give it up for 'em.
Come on up here.

737
00:42:14,009 --> 00:42:15,184
All right!

738
00:42:18,797 --> 00:42:20,973
Nice work, guys.
Nice work.

739
00:42:23,410 --> 00:42:25,804
Go ahead and give 'em a bow.

740
00:42:25,934 --> 00:42:28,458
We'll see you at Warped Tour!

741
00:42:32,288 --> 00:42:33,551
Yeah!

742
00:42:34,856 --> 00:42:37,685
Give it up!

743
00:42:47,260 --> 00:42:48,783
You guys were awesome.

744
00:42:48,914 --> 00:42:52,265
Yeah, you were too.
You were really, really good.

745
00:42:52,395 --> 00:42:54,833
I, uh, I liked your song.

746
00:42:54,963 --> 00:42:56,530
Yeah, it was super subtle.

747
00:42:58,793 --> 00:43:01,513
Actually, Danny's the one who came
up with the pink guitar line, so...

748
00:43:01,579 --> 00:43:03,339
- Oh, really?
- Yeah, I've always wanted one.

749
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:05,321
You can borrow mine
whenever you want.

750
00:43:05,452 --> 00:43:07,802
You should've called it
"We'll work for tacos."

751
00:43:07,933 --> 00:43:11,023
Wouldn't be lying.

752
00:43:11,153 --> 00:43:15,375
Um, how about we go get some pizza?
A slice or two?

753
00:43:15,505 --> 00:43:17,246
Um, I have an interview
in the morning.

754
00:43:17,377 --> 00:43:18,657
I should probably
get some sleep.

755
00:43:18,683 --> 00:43:20,249
Yeah, I don't know.
I'm kinda tired.

756
00:43:20,380 --> 00:43:22,053
- I just wanna go home.
- Oh, hey, hey, hey.

757
00:43:22,077 --> 00:43:23,794
- Didn't I say to break this up? Let's go.
- Yeah, sorry.

758
00:43:23,818 --> 00:43:25,646
- Sorry.
- Let's go, out.

759
00:43:25,777 --> 00:43:27,929
- We're going.
- I know you guys have a date. Let's go, keep on.

760
00:43:27,953 --> 00:43:30,085
- Charlie, you have my keys?
- - Yes.

761
00:43:31,957 --> 00:43:33,872
- Uh, hey, Amie?
- You're a winner.

762
00:43:34,002 --> 00:43:35,613
- Um...
- Yeah?

763
00:43:35,743 --> 00:43:38,093
Sorry, can I just talk to you
for a second, just real quick?

764
00:43:38,224 --> 00:43:39,544
- Sure.
- I have to get back, too.

765
00:43:39,573 --> 00:43:42,097
- Um, uh...
- What?

766
00:43:42,228 --> 00:43:44,360
I was just...

767
00:43:44,491 --> 00:43:48,887
wondering if maybe you wanted
to go out just the two of us?

768
00:43:50,497 --> 00:43:53,848
Um, I...

769
00:43:53,979 --> 00:43:57,809
Uh, I don't know.
I just... I can't.

770
00:43:57,939 --> 00:43:59,767
- I'm sorry.
- Okay, no, that's...

771
00:43:59,898 --> 00:44:01,464
- Maybe another time, though.
- Yeah.

772
00:44:02,901 --> 00:44:05,904
- Hey, you're a winner.
- Thank you.

773
00:44:07,732 --> 00:44:10,473
It's okay. You're a
winner in my book.

774
00:44:12,345 --> 00:44:14,608
- Appreciate it.
- Have a good night.

775
00:44:24,574 --> 00:44:26,011
I know I should be sad...

776
00:44:28,230 --> 00:44:31,016
but, Charlie...

777
00:44:33,018 --> 00:44:34,193
Yeah.

778
00:44:34,323 --> 00:44:35,823
You know, it's probably
not a good idea

779
00:44:35,847 --> 00:44:38,501
for you guys to date members
of a competing band.

780
00:44:38,632 --> 00:44:40,068
Don't be silly.

781
00:44:42,418 --> 00:44:44,246
There's gum on my bucket.

782
00:44:46,031 --> 00:44:47,336
You guys dare me to eat it?

783
00:44:47,467 --> 00:44:48,294
- No.
- No.

784
00:44:48,424 --> 00:44:49,687
Fine, I dare myself.

785
00:44:52,298 --> 00:44:55,475
They don't call me "Double
Dog Dan" for nothing.

786
00:44:55,605 --> 00:44:58,739
- Nobody calls you "Double Dog Dan."
- No one calls you that.

787
00:44:58,870 --> 00:45:01,873
Guys, all great bands have
been rejected at some point.

788
00:45:02,003 --> 00:45:04,527
It's like a rite of passage.

789
00:45:04,658 --> 00:45:07,966
Yeah, I get it,
but we didn't get in.

790
00:45:09,924 --> 00:45:12,927
I just... I don't think
that's such a big deal.

791
00:45:13,058 --> 00:45:15,538
I think we can still play
small shows around here.

792
00:45:17,149 --> 00:45:18,541
We don't have to give up.

793
00:45:18,672 --> 00:45:20,476
Yes, we can play small shows
and build our fan base.

794
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:22,502
Yes, exactly.

795
00:45:22,632 --> 00:45:25,766
Guys, we gave it our best
shot and that wasn't enough.

796
00:45:25,897 --> 00:45:28,682
Okay, but Warped Tour
was never the end goal.

797
00:45:28,813 --> 00:45:30,728
Like, yes, of course
it would've been nice,

798
00:45:30,858 --> 00:45:33,513
- but we don't need it.
- Yeah, I don't think we do.

799
00:45:39,171 --> 00:45:42,783
So, that song...

800
00:45:45,655 --> 00:45:48,920
Who could possibly be
the full-time cutie?

801
00:45:50,225 --> 00:45:52,401
- Hey, Joe?
- Yeah?

802
00:45:52,532 --> 00:45:53,751
How much gas do we have left?

803
00:45:55,143 --> 00:45:57,058
- Enough, why?
- That was our exit.

804
00:45:59,931 --> 00:46:01,671
"Vans Warped Tour."

805
00:46:01,802 --> 00:46:04,196
Is that like the shoes?
Vans shoes?

806
00:46:04,326 --> 00:46:06,807
Why is it "warped"?

807
00:46:06,938 --> 00:46:08,742
- That's what I wanna know.
- Vans, they must be...

808
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,420
I also wanna know
what time it is. Where is he?

809
00:46:11,551 --> 00:46:12,944
Hey, speak of the devil!

810
00:46:13,074 --> 00:46:14,714
- Hey, congratulations.
- Congratulations.

811
00:46:14,815 --> 00:46:17,557
We got tickets.
We got tickets.

812
00:46:17,687 --> 00:46:19,341
Do you have three
so I can go with you?

813
00:46:19,472 --> 00:46:22,214
- What? What happened?
- What?

814
00:46:25,130 --> 00:46:26,131
What?

815
00:46:26,261 --> 00:46:28,655
We, um...

816
00:46:29,961 --> 00:46:31,223
We didn't get it.

817
00:46:32,964 --> 00:46:35,357
Well, there's next year.

818
00:46:35,488 --> 00:46:38,012
No, this was
the last Warped Tour, so...

819
00:46:38,143 --> 00:46:40,798
It's the last tour ever?
I mean, come on.

820
00:46:40,928 --> 00:46:44,323
It's not, like, about the tour.

821
00:46:44,453 --> 00:46:48,196
It's just... it's just
that they didn't want us.

822
00:46:51,286 --> 00:46:53,854
I feel like I have
the best band in the world...

823
00:46:55,551 --> 00:46:57,727
- and nobody cares.
- Honey...

824
00:46:57,858 --> 00:47:00,469
you can't tell me that
there won't be other venues

825
00:47:00,600 --> 00:47:03,211
and other tours to play on.

826
00:47:03,342 --> 00:47:05,257
Your opportunities
are only limited

827
00:47:05,387 --> 00:47:08,782
by your hard work
and your will. Right?

828
00:47:10,175 --> 00:47:11,524
Come on.

829
00:47:13,091 --> 00:47:15,571
Knuckle it up.
Come on, knuckles.

830
00:47:21,186 --> 00:47:22,927
Dad, it's really weird
when you do it.

831
00:47:23,057 --> 00:47:25,364
No, no, it's not.

832
00:48:32,561 --> 00:48:35,216
Hey, how'd the battle
go last night?

833
00:48:36,652 --> 00:48:38,654
Do I need to find
your replacement?

834
00:48:38,785 --> 00:48:39,960
Didn't make it.

835
00:48:42,441 --> 00:48:43,877
Told you.

836
00:48:55,454 --> 00:48:56,629
Look, Danny,

837
00:48:56,759 --> 00:48:58,544
I'm sorry I came down
on you so hard.

838
00:48:59,980 --> 00:49:01,547
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

839
00:49:04,767 --> 00:49:06,117
I know you're really bummed

840
00:49:06,247 --> 00:49:08,007
'cause things didn't
work out for you, but...

841
00:49:10,295 --> 00:49:12,993
maybe it's time
to... be realistic.

842
00:49:14,429 --> 00:49:16,083
Not everyone can be an artist.

843
00:49:16,214 --> 00:49:18,303
There are gonna be a lot
more opportunities, Dad.

844
00:49:30,271 --> 00:49:32,056
Hey.

845
00:49:38,453 --> 00:49:40,020
You guys really killed it.

846
00:49:40,151 --> 00:49:42,501
Yeah, yeah, we did.

847
00:49:45,373 --> 00:49:47,723
Sorry you didn't make it.

848
00:49:47,854 --> 00:49:51,075
No, it's fine. We're, um...
We're getting back on track.

849
00:49:51,205 --> 00:49:53,991
It's... it's gonna be fine.

850
00:49:55,775 --> 00:49:57,298
Hey, I mean,
worst case scenario,

851
00:49:57,429 --> 00:49:59,126
you can always work at Nick's.

852
00:49:59,257 --> 00:50:00,910
I already work at Nick's.

853
00:50:02,390 --> 00:50:03,478
Yeah.

854
00:50:08,396 --> 00:50:09,789
You're gonna make it.

855
00:50:12,748 --> 00:50:14,228
Hey, I was doing some research.

856
00:50:14,359 --> 00:50:15,679
Uh, we're so close
to Minneapolis,

857
00:50:15,795 --> 00:50:17,188
we should play at The Garage.

858
00:50:17,318 --> 00:50:19,233
Anybody who's anybody
goes through there.

859
00:50:19,364 --> 00:50:21,931
- Okay, that sounds good.
- How soon can we book it?

860
00:50:22,062 --> 00:50:24,673
Also, do you
have any fruit snacks?

861
00:50:27,589 --> 00:50:30,201
I got pretzels,
these cheese things,

862
00:50:30,331 --> 00:50:32,899
- and marshmallows.
- Marshmallows.

863
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:34,466
Good choice.

864
00:50:34,596 --> 00:50:36,270
Pretty soon, I'm just waiting
to hear back from them.

865
00:50:36,294 --> 00:50:37,991
He loves to make you wait.

866
00:50:47,348 --> 00:50:48,480
♪ I'm not sorry ♪

867
00:50:49,829 --> 00:50:51,483
♪ I'm not sorry ♪

868
00:50:52,701 --> 00:50:55,139
Oh, wow.

869
00:50:55,269 --> 00:50:57,532
Oh, look what
the cat dragged in.

870
00:50:57,663 --> 00:50:59,317
You live here?

871
00:50:59,447 --> 00:51:01,188
Yeah.
What's up, weirdos?

872
00:51:01,319 --> 00:51:05,671
Uh, we're just doing
some official band stuff

873
00:51:05,801 --> 00:51:07,499
around the neighborhood and so...

874
00:51:07,629 --> 00:51:11,242
Yeah, merch, building our brand.
Super professional.

875
00:51:11,372 --> 00:51:13,592
Getting a huge SD
on our wall as well.

876
00:51:13,722 --> 00:51:14,810
Oh, sounds major.

877
00:51:16,725 --> 00:51:19,380
Do you guys wanna take a break
from your band business?

878
00:51:19,511 --> 00:51:21,208
- Official...
- Sorry, official.

879
00:51:21,339 --> 00:51:23,950
No, we'll like...
We won't bother you guys.

880
00:51:24,081 --> 00:51:26,039
- I mean, I could use a break.
- Same.

881
00:51:26,170 --> 00:51:28,781
Oh, I mean, yeah, we could
totally grab some food.

882
00:51:28,911 --> 00:51:30,783
Yeah, I could eat.

883
00:51:30,913 --> 00:51:33,916
Did you guys know that cats
only meow to mimic humans?

884
00:51:40,706 --> 00:51:42,142
- Danny.
- Danny.

885
00:52:02,684 --> 00:52:03,990
Ew.

886
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:07,080
Yeah, uh, is that street legal?

887
00:52:07,211 --> 00:52:08,908
Yeah, it's street legal.

888
00:52:11,171 --> 00:52:13,913
Don't worry about that.
That's all the usual stuff.

889
00:52:14,043 --> 00:52:16,959
I am so impressed.

890
00:52:17,090 --> 00:52:18,570
It smells like
high-grade diesel.

891
00:52:18,700 --> 00:52:20,528
I wish it was high-grade diesel.

892
00:52:29,972 --> 00:52:31,104
Thank you.

893
00:52:32,279 --> 00:52:33,933
Um, no, I mean, like...

894
00:52:34,063 --> 00:52:36,022
'Cause if you're asking
about my life plans...

895
00:52:36,153 --> 00:52:38,590
No, I wanna know, like, college
or are you staying here?

896
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:40,853
Well, you know, I actually
have it all planned out.

897
00:52:40,983 --> 00:52:43,247
- Who made your t-shirts?
- Oh, I did.

898
00:52:43,377 --> 00:52:45,423
I was taking this online
graphics course,

899
00:52:45,553 --> 00:52:48,556
- and I've gotten pretty good at it.
- What?

900
00:52:48,687 --> 00:52:51,516
Really good?
More like really awesome.

901
00:52:51,646 --> 00:52:54,562
- Uh, thank you.
- Yeah.

902
00:52:54,693 --> 00:52:58,087
- Uh, awesome.
- Hey, so, you just moved here?

903
00:52:58,218 --> 00:53:00,829
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

904
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,658
- I'm from St. Paul.
- Okay.

905
00:53:03,789 --> 00:53:05,747
Yeah, I convinced my dad
to get a job here.

906
00:53:05,878 --> 00:53:09,186
I think... I don't know,
I think we could do something.

907
00:53:09,316 --> 00:53:12,754
And I don't know if I'm ever
gonna meet these guys again.

908
00:53:12,885 --> 00:53:15,627
And so, like, you live
across the street from Dave?

909
00:53:15,757 --> 00:53:18,760
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm there, like, all the time.

910
00:53:21,372 --> 00:53:22,851
Cool.

911
00:53:22,982 --> 00:53:25,178
Like, in college, you know,
I could keep up music, sure,

912
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:26,962
- but I don't know if I'd ever...
- Yeah, I don't know.

913
00:53:26,986 --> 00:53:29,902
I think maybe
that's not a bad idea.

914
00:53:31,382 --> 00:53:33,427
You know, we wanna start
printing shirts soon.

915
00:53:33,558 --> 00:53:35,429
You should totally
design our graphic.

916
00:53:35,560 --> 00:53:36,952
The guys would love that.

917
00:53:37,083 --> 00:53:38,483
- Oh, my God, I'd love to.
- Really?

918
00:53:38,606 --> 00:53:40,304
- I'd be honored, yeah.
- Yeah!

919
00:53:40,434 --> 00:53:42,654
Friendship.

920
00:53:47,267 --> 00:53:49,791
- From my grandfather.
- Really?

921
00:53:49,922 --> 00:53:51,358
Yeah.

922
00:53:51,489 --> 00:53:53,404
- I think right now...
- Guys, guys!

923
00:53:53,534 --> 00:53:55,232
- We made the cover!
- What?

924
00:53:55,362 --> 00:53:57,408
- Look!
- Wait, let me see this.

925
00:53:57,538 --> 00:54:00,106
- You look awesome!
- Ooh, that's us!

926
00:54:00,237 --> 00:54:01,866
Wait, wait, wait.
"Danny Green, Dave Pearson,

927
00:54:01,890 --> 00:54:03,631
and Joe Seifus take time..."

928
00:54:03,762 --> 00:54:05,024
Does it say my name?

929
00:54:05,154 --> 00:54:06,765
Look at your cute little face.

930
00:54:06,895 --> 00:54:08,215
- Take this.
- Yeah, yeah, no, no.

931
00:54:08,288 --> 00:54:09,613
- Take that.
- We have to take this.

932
00:54:09,637 --> 00:54:11,197
- Put it in the van.
- God, that's sick!

933
00:54:11,291 --> 00:54:12,292
Guys...

934
00:54:13,467 --> 00:54:16,078
My mom is literally
gonna kill me.

935
00:54:16,209 --> 00:54:17,341
You coming?

936
00:54:18,342 --> 00:54:19,908
Uh, yeah.

937
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:53,115
Hi.

938
00:54:53,246 --> 00:54:55,683
You skipped our Iowa State trip.

939
00:54:57,946 --> 00:54:59,818
No, I... I went.

940
00:55:02,211 --> 00:55:04,213
- You did?
- Mm-hmm.

941
00:55:07,565 --> 00:55:09,262
I played a show on the way back.

942
00:55:09,393 --> 00:55:13,092
So you toured the classrooms?

943
00:55:13,222 --> 00:55:15,399
And you ate lunch
in the cafeteria?

944
00:55:19,881 --> 00:55:21,883
I saw the outside.

945
00:55:23,058 --> 00:55:28,542
So you buzzed through the parking
lot, and you staged a photo

946
00:55:28,673 --> 00:55:30,283
so that you could lie to me?

947
00:55:30,414 --> 00:55:31,719
I wasn't lying.

948
00:55:31,850 --> 00:55:33,068
Why?

949
00:55:33,199 --> 00:55:34,896
'Cause if I told you,
you would...

950
00:55:35,027 --> 00:55:37,377
- Because I would say no!
- Yeah.

951
00:55:37,508 --> 00:55:39,727
Because we planned this.

952
00:55:41,773 --> 00:55:43,862
Because we've... we planned this.

953
00:55:43,992 --> 00:55:45,342
I know.

954
00:55:47,735 --> 00:55:50,608
Mom, I-I know we planned this.
I know that.

955
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:57,179
But this...
this is what I wanna do.

956
00:55:58,398 --> 00:56:00,400
And I'm really good at it.

957
00:56:03,055 --> 00:56:04,728
You're acting like you
haven't lied before.

958
00:56:04,752 --> 00:56:06,363
This isn't about me.

959
00:56:08,016 --> 00:56:10,323
And I would not lie to you.

960
00:56:10,454 --> 00:56:13,195
It's been you and me, and
that means something to me.

961
00:56:13,326 --> 00:56:16,547
- And I thought I could count on that.
- You can.

962
00:57:27,008 --> 00:57:28,662
Okay, um...

963
00:57:30,098 --> 00:57:31,360
So you're a musician.

964
00:57:31,491 --> 00:57:33,406
I mean, like,
you're a famous musician,

965
00:57:33,537 --> 00:57:34,929
like, you've made it.
But...

966
00:57:37,279 --> 00:57:40,848
the only thing you can play...

967
00:57:40,979 --> 00:57:42,894
is covers of commercial jingles.

968
00:57:43,024 --> 00:57:44,896
- No, no.
- No?

969
00:57:45,026 --> 00:57:46,419
Yes.

970
00:57:46,550 --> 00:57:49,030
- What? Seriously?
- I mean, okay.

971
00:57:51,424 --> 00:57:53,818
So you can tell
the truth all the time,

972
00:57:53,948 --> 00:57:57,038
- but nobody believes you.
- No, that sucks.

973
00:57:57,169 --> 00:57:59,040
- I can't do that.
- Yes.

974
00:57:59,171 --> 00:58:00,583
Are you just saying yes
to everything?

975
00:58:00,607 --> 00:58:02,130
No, that's my everyday life.

976
00:58:02,261 --> 00:58:06,221
And I love commercial jingles,
they're super catchy.

977
00:58:06,352 --> 00:58:08,006
But more importantly,

978
00:58:08,136 --> 00:58:12,271
if you were given a trough
of ice cream on your birthday,

979
00:58:12,401 --> 00:58:14,795
but the only thing
you could do is bathe in it,

980
00:58:14,926 --> 00:58:16,754
would you be happy or sad?

981
00:58:31,333 --> 00:58:32,770
- Hi.
- Hi.

982
00:58:33,771 --> 00:58:35,512
Um, is Amie home?

983
00:58:35,642 --> 00:58:37,426
She hasn't responded to us.

984
00:58:37,557 --> 00:58:38,732
Yep, she's in her room.

985
00:58:40,212 --> 00:58:41,256
Great.

986
00:58:43,041 --> 00:58:45,043
I can't keep lying to my mom.

987
00:58:47,045 --> 00:58:49,005
It's just the two of us
and she's depending on me.

988
00:58:50,701 --> 00:58:51,832
So...

989
00:58:52,833 --> 00:58:55,706
you're gonna let your mom
crush our dream?

990
00:58:57,838 --> 00:59:01,755
- No, no, no, let me talk to her...
- No, Charlie, stay out of it.

991
00:59:01,886 --> 00:59:04,105
Lucy, do you have anything
to say about this?

992
00:59:05,933 --> 00:59:07,631
Cool, am I the only one here

993
00:59:07,761 --> 00:59:09,434
- who cares at all about this band?
- Are you kidding me?

994
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:12,549
I wouldn't be lying to my mom
for this long if I didn't care.

995
00:59:12,679 --> 00:59:15,247
I just can't keep
doing this to her.

996
00:59:15,377 --> 00:59:18,642
"Doing this to her"? I'm sorry,
when has she ever put you first?

997
00:59:18,772 --> 00:59:19,860
Seriously?

998
00:59:21,122 --> 00:59:24,169
Lucy, what's up?
Why are you being so quiet?

999
00:59:25,823 --> 00:59:27,085
I got an internship.

1000
00:59:27,215 --> 00:59:30,218
What?
You're kidding.

1001
00:59:30,349 --> 00:59:32,699
My interview was the day
after Battle of the Bands.

1002
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:34,222
What if we made Warped Tour?

1003
00:59:34,353 --> 00:59:36,442
I told my parents
that, if we made Warped Tour,

1004
00:59:36,573 --> 00:59:38,749
that I'd cancel the internship.

1005
00:59:38,879 --> 00:59:41,795
But the deal was, if we
didn't, then I'd take it.

1006
00:59:44,058 --> 00:59:46,191
And-and you just...
You forgot to tell us?

1007
00:59:46,321 --> 00:59:48,323
I thought we were
gonna go on tour.

1008
00:59:48,454 --> 00:59:51,588
I thought it was gonna be great
and nothing would interfere.

1009
00:59:51,718 --> 00:59:53,807
Guys, I really thought
we were gonna make it.

1010
00:59:53,938 --> 00:59:56,157
Wow.

1011
00:59:58,159 --> 00:59:59,508
When are you leaving?

1012
01:00:02,599 --> 01:00:03,600
Tomorrow.

1013
01:00:08,126 --> 01:00:09,562
Guys, I didn't mean to hurt you.

1014
01:00:09,693 --> 01:00:11,956
You guys know my family
moved here for you, right?

1015
01:00:13,566 --> 01:00:14,741
For the band?

1016
01:00:14,872 --> 01:00:16,351
You don't even care?

1017
01:00:16,482 --> 01:00:19,659
Can you stop thinking about
yourself for one second?

1018
01:00:19,790 --> 01:00:21,922
You're not even listening to us.

1019
01:00:22,053 --> 01:00:25,143
- I can't believe you guys.
- Charlie, come on.

1020
01:00:25,273 --> 01:00:26,405
Charlie!

1021
01:00:36,807 --> 01:00:38,765
Hey, Charlie.
Charlie, hey.

1022
01:00:40,941 --> 01:00:42,639
- Hey, you good?
- I'm fine.

1023
01:00:43,901 --> 01:00:45,032
Okay, what's going on?

1024
01:00:45,163 --> 01:00:46,686
You are the last person
in the world

1025
01:00:46,817 --> 01:00:48,427
I would talk to about this!

1026
01:01:01,919 --> 01:01:04,356
Hey, there, stranger.

1027
01:01:04,486 --> 01:01:07,098
Hey! What are you
doing here?

1028
01:01:07,228 --> 01:01:10,144
I could really go for a scoop
of strawberry ice cream.

1029
01:01:10,275 --> 01:01:11,493
Oh, you got it.

1030
01:01:19,110 --> 01:01:20,851
How you gonna pay for this?

1031
01:01:25,594 --> 01:01:28,597
What? No way!

1032
01:01:28,728 --> 01:01:29,990
All yours.

1033
01:01:32,732 --> 01:01:34,386
Lucy, this is amazing.

1034
01:01:34,516 --> 01:01:36,301
Yeah, I got
the lightning bolt in there.

1035
01:01:38,695 --> 01:01:40,044
Wow.

1036
01:01:41,741 --> 01:01:43,874
Is that a birthday Husky?

1037
01:01:44,004 --> 01:01:45,266
Oh, yeah.

1038
01:01:45,397 --> 01:01:47,486
Awesome!

1039
01:02:13,425 --> 01:02:14,556
Do you want my advice?

1040
01:02:14,687 --> 01:02:15,993
- No.
- Okay.

1041
01:02:21,607 --> 01:02:23,043
But what is it?

1042
01:02:24,958 --> 01:02:27,874
Your mom is your mom,
like, that's just...

1043
01:02:29,615 --> 01:02:31,835
It's really tough, but...

1044
01:02:35,055 --> 01:02:37,971
they're your band. You know,
like, they're your friends and...

1045
01:02:44,412 --> 01:02:46,632
I don't know, I think
you gotta talk to them.

1046
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:47,764
I did.

1047
01:02:49,113 --> 01:02:51,245
Right, I know you did, but...

1048
01:02:53,508 --> 01:02:57,556
I mean, to be honest, I-I saw
Charlie after you talked to them,

1049
01:02:57,686 --> 01:03:00,080
and I think you need to talk
to them again, because...

1050
01:03:00,211 --> 01:03:01,560
They're not gonna listen.

1051
01:03:04,476 --> 01:03:06,913
- What do you mean?
- They don't get it that...

1052
01:03:07,044 --> 01:03:08,872
- Okay, but you can...
- They're not listening.

1053
01:03:09,002 --> 01:03:11,396
- I-I'm listening.
- No, you're not.

1054
01:03:11,526 --> 01:03:13,398
You're trying to fix it.

1055
01:03:14,573 --> 01:03:16,531
And I don't need you to fix it.

1056
01:03:16,662 --> 01:03:19,099
I need you to listen to me.

1057
01:03:19,230 --> 01:03:21,275
I'm trying, okay?

1058
01:03:22,233 --> 01:03:23,451
I know.

1059
01:03:27,325 --> 01:03:30,067
I really appreciate you trying.

1060
01:03:32,547 --> 01:03:34,941
I just can't have
this conversation.

1061
01:03:40,338 --> 01:03:42,209
I'm sorry.

1062
01:03:51,566 --> 01:03:53,307
I don't think Amie understands.

1063
01:03:53,438 --> 01:03:55,788
Like, yes, we wrote
all the songs together,

1064
01:03:55,919 --> 01:03:58,835
and we've always performed
together as a band,

1065
01:03:58,965 --> 01:04:00,880
but, like, without her,
there is no band.

1066
01:04:01,011 --> 01:04:04,014
She's literally the lead singer.
I mean, am I crazy?

1067
01:04:04,144 --> 01:04:06,668
I feel crazy. You would tell
me if I'm being crazy, right?

1068
01:04:08,496 --> 01:04:10,759
I mean, but they are
your friends.

1069
01:04:10,890 --> 01:04:12,065
I know.

1070
01:04:12,196 --> 01:04:14,198
I know, I know
they're my friends, but...

1071
01:04:14,328 --> 01:04:17,592
Look, you'll figure it out.
Just give them some space,

1072
01:04:17,723 --> 01:04:19,507
give yourself some space and...

1073
01:04:24,295 --> 01:04:27,124
Is that your lady friend?

1074
01:04:27,254 --> 01:04:29,735
I'm hoping
you're my lady friend.

1075
01:04:38,439 --> 01:04:40,746
- You have, um, you have...
- What?

1076
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:42,487
- I got it.
- Oh.

1077
01:04:43,749 --> 01:04:45,098
Oh, there it is.

1078
01:04:46,839 --> 01:04:48,275
Make a wish.

1079
01:04:53,367 --> 01:04:56,414
- What did you wish for?
- It's a secret.

1080
01:04:58,546 --> 01:05:01,245
Cool.

1081
01:05:01,375 --> 01:05:02,681
Cool.

1082
01:05:05,466 --> 01:05:07,468
So, I'll-I'll see you later.

1083
01:05:07,599 --> 01:05:08,861
Yeah.

1084
01:05:10,645 --> 01:05:11,777
Sweet.

1085
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:17,043
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

1086
01:05:20,220 --> 01:05:22,222
Bye.

1087
01:05:51,295 --> 01:05:53,166
- Hi.
- Hey, there.

1088
01:05:55,212 --> 01:05:56,735
I honestly thought

1089
01:05:56,865 --> 01:05:58,104
you guys were gonna let me go
without saying goodbye.

1090
01:05:58,128 --> 01:05:59,520
No.

1091
01:05:59,651 --> 01:06:02,480
I'm still mad at you,
but I wouldn't do that.

1092
01:06:25,242 --> 01:06:27,461
I'm so proud of our little baby.

1093
01:06:27,592 --> 01:06:29,333
All grown up.

1094
01:06:31,683 --> 01:06:32,901
Are we good?

1095
01:06:33,859 --> 01:06:35,165
Maybe.

1096
01:06:36,731 --> 01:06:38,603
Come here.

1097
01:06:50,528 --> 01:06:53,096

1098
01:06:53,226 --> 01:06:54,967

Huh, huh.

01:07:01,278 --> 01:07:02,975

are you boys up to?

1101
01:07:03,106 --> 01:07:04,977
We're trying to make shirts.

01:07:06,065 --> 01:07:07,065
Oh.

1103
01:07:08,676 --> 01:07:10,765
Sweetie, what is
that design supposed to be?

01:07:19,687 --> 01:07:23,082

Yeah, nice job.

Hey, hey, hey.

1168
01:12:25,428 --> 01:12:27,299
- Hello.
- Hi.

1169
01:12:27,430 --> 01:12:31,172
We thought we'd just have
a little sit down with y'all.

1170
01:12:31,303 --> 01:12:33,697
We know how much the show meant
to all of you.

1171
01:12:33,827 --> 01:12:35,873
And with it coming up,
there's probably not a chance

1172
01:12:36,003 --> 01:12:37,222
you're gonna get on that stage.

1173
01:12:37,353 --> 01:12:39,267
It's really too bad, too.

1174
01:12:39,398 --> 01:12:43,054
I mean, those Warped Tour
people are never gonna see

1175
01:12:43,184 --> 01:12:44,708
what they're missing out on.

1176
01:12:44,838 --> 01:12:46,362
Or will they?

1177
01:12:48,189 --> 01:12:49,269
What are you talking about?

1178
01:12:49,321 --> 01:12:51,236
Yeah, what do you mean?

1179
01:12:51,367 --> 01:12:55,153
If you can't get
on the Warped Tour stage...

1180
01:12:55,283 --> 01:12:56,502
build your own.

1181
01:12:56,633 --> 01:12:58,461
Wait, I'm liking
where you're going.

1182
01:12:58,591 --> 01:13:02,203
Yeah, well, I have this client
who has a very big parking space

1183
01:13:02,334 --> 01:13:06,294
that happens to be right across
from where the Warped Tour plays.

1184
01:13:08,296 --> 01:13:10,386
Pretty sure I can get them
to sponsor you.

1185
01:13:10,516 --> 01:13:12,431
We'd bring the Summertime
to them.

1186
01:13:12,562 --> 01:13:14,128
We would play there,

1187
01:13:14,259 --> 01:13:17,784
and then everyone who was
walking by would have to...

1188
01:13:17,915 --> 01:13:21,179
- walk by us.
- Yes, I love it!

1189
01:13:21,309 --> 01:13:24,530
Wait, that's brilliant.

1190
01:13:24,661 --> 01:13:28,142
Warped Tour, here we come.

1191
01:13:28,273 --> 01:13:29,753
Anybody gonna eat that?

1192
01:13:29,883 --> 01:13:31,643
- No, Danny, it's all yours...
- Yes, I was...

1193
01:13:31,711 --> 01:13:33,711
- I was going to.
- - Oh, well, I gave it to Danny.

1194
01:13:36,716 --> 01:13:38,215
What do you think?
What do you think of that?

1195
01:13:38,239 --> 01:13:40,633
If it's like a...

1196
01:13:44,245 --> 01:13:45,769
- Right?
- It's okay,

1197
01:13:45,899 --> 01:13:47,901
but it should go up
on the second riff.

1198
01:13:49,990 --> 01:13:52,384
Play it.

1199
01:14:00,174 --> 01:14:02,046
Yeah.

1200
01:14:02,176 --> 01:14:03,616
- That's good.
- Yeah, that's better.

1201
01:14:03,743 --> 01:14:05,745
- Yeah.
- That is good.

1202
01:14:06,833 --> 01:14:08,073
It's better than what you wrote.

1203
01:14:08,182 --> 01:14:09,662
True.

1204
01:14:09,793 --> 01:14:10,881
Why don't you play with us?

1205
01:14:12,099 --> 01:14:14,624
Like, as a part of Summertime?

1206
01:14:15,842 --> 01:14:17,844
Yeah, you should.

1207
01:14:20,847 --> 01:14:23,546
Okay, we all know they should,
so is it a yes or no?

1208
01:15:19,645 --> 01:15:21,255
Amie?

1209
01:15:21,386 --> 01:15:22,996
Could you come sit?

1210
01:15:34,486 --> 01:15:36,575
What's up?

1211
01:15:36,706 --> 01:15:39,404
I've been thinking
a lot about what you said.

1212
01:15:40,797 --> 01:15:42,233
And I...

1213
01:15:42,363 --> 01:15:44,844
I... I wanted
to show you this.

1214
01:15:46,106 --> 01:15:47,106
What is this?

1215
01:16:00,468 --> 01:16:02,601
- You were in a band?
- I was.

1216
01:16:04,908 --> 01:16:07,084
Why haven't you told me this?

1217
01:16:07,214 --> 01:16:10,827
It's a... different life.

1218
01:16:15,092 --> 01:16:17,398
When I was your age,

1219
01:16:17,529 --> 01:16:22,142
I met this really great guy,

1220
01:16:22,273 --> 01:16:27,017
and we played music
and we were good.

1221
01:16:27,147 --> 01:16:32,239
And a promoter heard us
and we started touring.

1222
01:16:33,632 --> 01:16:37,070
It was like
this great adventure,

1223
01:16:37,201 --> 01:16:38,637
and then it ended.

1224
01:16:41,074 --> 01:16:42,336
What happened?

1225
01:16:43,468 --> 01:16:44,904
Well, we had you.

1226
01:16:49,039 --> 01:16:50,649
So I ruined your career?

1227
01:16:50,780 --> 01:16:51,998
No.

1228
01:16:53,086 --> 01:16:57,438
No, you were the best thing
that I got out of my career.

1229
01:16:59,702 --> 01:17:02,748
But the industry's really hard.

1230
01:17:02,879 --> 01:17:04,532
And I watched it...

1231
01:17:05,882 --> 01:17:08,406
really chew up
a lot of my friends.

1232
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:14,238
It's a hard life and I wanted
something better than that for you.

1233
01:17:17,110 --> 01:17:18,634
And I want you to be happy.

1234
01:17:19,591 --> 01:17:21,419
But I am.

1235
01:17:22,899 --> 01:17:25,641
I'm really happy.

1236
01:17:25,771 --> 01:17:30,515
Your father gave me that
our first paid gig.

1237
01:17:30,646 --> 01:17:32,648
- This?
- Yeah.

1238
01:17:37,522 --> 01:17:40,743
- Can I borrow it?
- You can have it.

1239
01:17:45,182 --> 01:17:46,749
We have a show coming up.

1240
01:17:49,229 --> 01:17:51,231
I really want you to be there.

1241
01:18:44,458 --> 01:18:45,633
- Mom.
- Oh, hey, hun.

1242
01:18:45,764 --> 01:18:47,133
Hey, what's up?
We're about to perform.

1243
01:18:47,157 --> 01:18:49,289
I know.
It's so exciting.

1244
01:18:49,420 --> 01:18:51,074
What are you doing?

1245
01:18:51,204 --> 01:18:54,251
Um, just getting the word out
about the show online.

1246
01:18:54,381 --> 01:18:56,340
- Ooh, smart.
- Yep.

1247
01:18:56,470 --> 01:18:59,082
- I already have 36 retweets.
- Oh, oh.

1248
01:18:59,212 --> 01:19:01,214
We know all the real bands
have merch.

1249
01:19:01,345 --> 01:19:02,912

1250
01:19:03,042 --> 01:19:05,044
No, no, they're not.

1251

But these? These are cool.

1252
01:19:11,311 --> 01:19:13,400
What? No, Dad, come on.

1253

1254

Yes, yes.

1255
01:19:19,493 --> 01:19:21,234

1256
01:19:21,365 --> 01:19:23,541
