00:00:24,315 --> 00:00:27,068
-Ladies and gentleman.
-[cheering]

4
00:00:27,152 --> 00:00:30,947
You can feel excitement in the air.

5
00:00:31,030 --> 00:00:34,743
Here we go, Houston, Texas!

6
00:00:34,826 --> 00:00:35,785
[cheering]

7
00:00:35,869 --> 00:00:38,455
Let's get this show on the road.

8
00:00:38,538 --> 00:00:42,125
Dwayne Johnson here,
also known as The Rock,

9
00:00:42,208 --> 00:00:45,462
also known as <i>La Roca</i> in Spanish,

10
00:00:45,545 --> 00:00:48,882
also known
as the sexiest motherfucker alive.

11
00:00:48,965 --> 00:00:51,468
It's not important right now,
but what is important

12
00:00:51,551 --> 00:00:54,596
that you guys
have come together to see one man.

13
00:00:54,679 --> 00:00:57,849
The man who hails
from a place that many of you know.

14
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,809
-The Alief area.
-[cheering]

15
00:00:59,893 --> 00:01:00,727
Yes. [chuckles]

16
00:01:01,561 --> 00:01:03,646
"The SWAT" as we call it.

17
00:01:03,730 --> 00:01:06,399
Many amazing people
have come out of the Swat.

18
00:01:06,483 --> 00:01:10,153
-Lizzo, Beyoncé, Travis Scott.
-[cheering]

19
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:14,199
And one other person, who you guys
did not know has come out of the Swat,

20
00:01:14,282 --> 00:01:17,702
is the one
and only people's champ, The Rock!

21
00:01:17,786 --> 00:01:19,370
[cheering]

22
00:01:19,454 --> 00:01:21,831
Well, just for tonight,
I've come out of the Swat.

23
00:01:21,915 --> 00:01:23,792
But tomorrow I'll be from some place else.

24
00:01:23,875 --> 00:01:25,585
Probably Hawaii. Listen,

25
00:01:25,668 --> 00:01:27,879
what is important
right now, [chuckles] is that

26
00:01:27,962 --> 00:01:31,382
I have the honor of introducing
the man who you have come to see.

27
00:01:31,466 --> 00:01:35,428
Ladies and gentlemen of Houston,
a warm hometown Houston welcome

28
00:01:35,512 --> 00:01:36,763
-for the man himself.
-[whistling]

29
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,556
The other people's champion.

30
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,352
My boy. Your boy. Mo Amer.

31
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:45,980

[cheering and whistling]

34
00:01:55,323 --> 00:01:56,407
What's up, Houston?

35
00:01:57,534 --> 00:01:59,786
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

36
00:02:04,332 --> 00:02:06,709
Take a seat. Take a seat. Take a seat.

37
00:02:07,585 --> 00:02:10,255
-We made it! We made it.
-[music fades out]

38
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:11,965
We made it, y'all.

39
00:02:12,048 --> 00:02:13,675
For real, like, it's so amazing.

40
00:02:13,758 --> 00:02:17,554
We're all here together.
I mean, after the last 19 months

41
00:02:17,637 --> 00:02:20,223
that we've had.
I mean, we're here. We're together.

42
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:21,975
As a live performer

43
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:24,269
-I thought it was over, to be honest.
-[laughing]

44
00:02:24,352 --> 00:02:26,729
And now we're here.
That was the second time

45
00:02:26,813 --> 00:02:30,191
I ever thought my career
potentially might be over.

46
00:02:31,151 --> 00:02:33,027
The first time…

47
00:02:34,112 --> 00:02:36,906
[laughing]

48
00:02:36,990 --> 00:02:38,783
was right after 9/11.

49
00:02:38,867 --> 00:02:42,287
[laughing and applause]

50
00:02:42,370 --> 00:02:46,082
Someone named Mohammed. I was like,
"It's not looking good for me out here."

51
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:48,168
-[laughing]
-[Mo chuckles]

52
00:02:49,252 --> 00:02:51,671
Matter of fact,
my own family turned on me.

53
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:52,589
[laughing]

54
00:02:52,672 --> 00:02:56,843
My own brother looked me dead in my eyes
and goes, "Your career is over."

55
00:02:56,926 --> 00:02:58,636
[laughing]

56
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,222
I was like, "How could you
say some shit like that to me?"

57
00:03:01,306 --> 00:03:03,516
"You know I always
wanted to be a stand up comedian."

58
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,477
He goes, "Look how
they're talking about us on the news."

59
00:03:06,561 --> 00:03:10,398
"Nobody wants to
see a Mohammed on stage telling jokes."

60
00:03:10,481 --> 00:03:12,567
"Your career is over."

61
00:03:12,650 --> 00:03:15,320
I said, "Omar, you're a pilot."

62
00:03:15,403 --> 00:03:18,281
[laughing and applause]

63
00:03:23,453 --> 00:03:24,787
Now I'm in a movie with The Rock.

64
00:03:24,871 --> 00:03:27,040
In your face, bitch.
You know what I mean? [chuckles]

65
00:03:27,123 --> 00:03:30,668
[cheering and applause]

66
00:03:34,088 --> 00:03:35,214
Wow.

67
00:03:36,299 --> 00:03:38,509
Is it over though? [sighs]

68
00:03:38,593 --> 00:03:40,678
Is the pandemic over? [sighs]

69
00:03:40,762 --> 00:03:42,597
Was it real? [sighs]

70
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:44,515
But what, is it over?

71
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:47,143
No for real, I'm asking.
Is it though? [soft grunt]

72
00:03:47,227 --> 00:03:50,897
I'm always like laughing
and about to cry at any moment inside.

73
00:03:50,980 --> 00:03:55,151
I'm like [chuckles and grunts].

74
00:03:55,235 --> 00:03:58,071
Was is real? Is it?

75
00:03:58,154 --> 00:03:59,948
You know what's real? Divorce is real.

76
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:01,241
-Divorce…
-[laughing]

77
00:04:01,324 --> 00:04:03,993
Divorce is real as fuck.

78
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:05,954
Divorce is so real.

79
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,914
I got divorced in the pandemic.

80
00:04:08,790 --> 00:04:11,042
It happened, you know.
What are you gonna do?

81
00:04:11,125 --> 00:04:14,295
-[whistling]
-We both-- one guy's happy.

82
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,839
[soft cheering and applause]

83
00:04:16,923 --> 00:04:19,509
It's not like those stories that you hear
where a comedian's like,

84
00:04:19,592 --> 00:04:20,760
"Fuck that bitch." No.

85
00:04:20,843 --> 00:04:22,720
It just didn't work out.
You know what I mean?

86
00:04:22,804 --> 00:04:24,597
And it's fine.

87
00:04:24,681 --> 00:04:28,142
And when you're married for so long
you're just use to certain things.

88
00:04:28,226 --> 00:04:30,019
I was dead asleep one night.

89
00:04:30,103 --> 00:04:32,480
-And then I farted so hard.
-[laughing]

90
00:04:32,563 --> 00:04:35,608
I farted so hard I woke up ashamed.
Like… [gasps]

91
00:04:35,692 --> 00:04:37,193
-Like this.
-[laughing]

92
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,363
And I looked over
to my left and I apologized.

93
00:04:40,446 --> 00:04:43,783
-And there was nobody there! [laughs]
-[laughing]

94
00:04:43,866 --> 00:04:45,576
I just turned over and cried. I was like…

95
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:46,995
-[sobs]
-[laughing]

96
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:50,665
I wrote that shit down immediately.
I'm like, "This is hilarious." [sobs]

97
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:53,459
[sobs then laughs]

98
00:04:53,543 --> 00:04:55,545
[laughing]

99
00:04:55,628 --> 00:04:58,339
Is it real? Was it?

100
00:04:58,423 --> 00:05:00,091
Is it real?

101
00:05:00,174 --> 00:05:01,926
I don't know.

102
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:03,344
-Fuck.
-[laughing]

103
00:05:03,428 --> 00:05:05,096
It's how I feel… [grunts]

104
00:05:05,179 --> 00:05:07,223
…all the time.

105
00:05:07,307 --> 00:05:09,267
Pandemi-- you know,

106
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:11,477
what the media did to us was,

107
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:13,855
honestly, it feels unforgivable.

108
00:05:13,938 --> 00:05:16,149
It really did. It's like,

109
00:05:16,232 --> 00:05:18,067
"Panic!" [screams]

110
00:05:18,151 --> 00:05:20,987
"It's coming!" "What's coming?"
"I don't know. It's coming."

111
00:05:21,070 --> 00:05:22,739
-[laughing]
-[shouts]

112
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,741
"Three people have it." "What? Huh?"

113
00:05:24,824 --> 00:05:26,409
"It's coming!" "What's coming?"

114
00:05:26,492 --> 00:05:27,577
"Something that has to do with a bat."

115
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:29,829
"I don't know." "Bats are coming?" "No!"

116
00:05:29,912 --> 00:05:31,164
-"It came from a bat."
-[laughing]

117
00:05:31,247 --> 00:05:33,666
"And it's this thing
you can't see with your naked eye,

118
00:05:33,750 --> 00:05:34,876
but it's coming."

119
00:05:34,959 --> 00:05:36,085
"You're all gonna die."

120
00:05:36,169 --> 00:05:38,588
[screams] "But don't be scared."

121
00:05:38,671 --> 00:05:42,216
"Don't--" "What do you mean?"
"Huh?" "I'm scared."

122
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:44,761
"I'm worried." [chuckles]
"Don't worry, just get Chlorox."

123
00:05:44,844 --> 00:05:46,679
-"You're gonna be fine."
-[laughing]

124
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:48,806
"Get as much Chlorox."

125
00:05:48,890 --> 00:05:51,267
[soft applause]

126
00:05:51,350 --> 00:05:53,686
-"But don't use the Chlorox…
-[laughing]

127
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,606
…before you use Chlorox on the Chlorox."

128
00:05:56,689 --> 00:05:59,025
-"Then you could use the Chlorox, okay."
-[laughing]

129
00:05:59,108 --> 00:06:00,902
"When you get packages,

130
00:06:00,985 --> 00:06:02,779
fucking bathe with the packages."

131
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:03,696
[laughing]

132
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:05,448
They had us all a bunch of assholes.
We're like…

-[spraying noise]
-[laughing]

134
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,826
"Amazon came in."

-[spraying noise]
-[laughing]

136
00:06:11,245 --> 00:06:14,165
"It's fine, fan it out. It's fine."

137
00:06:14,248 --> 00:06:16,918
[soft cheers and applause]

138
00:06:17,001 --> 00:06:17,919
[screams]

139
00:06:18,002 --> 00:06:19,045
[laughing]

140
00:06:19,128 --> 00:06:21,005
"Put on a mask." "How many masks?"

141
00:06:21,089 --> 00:06:22,507
It kept changing.

142
00:06:22,590 --> 00:06:23,466
[laughing]

143
00:06:23,549 --> 00:06:26,052
"Put on a mask. One mask.", Fauci said.

144
00:06:26,135 --> 00:06:29,472
"One mask is like 33% protection."

145
00:06:29,555 --> 00:06:31,099
"Two masks are like

146
00:06:31,182 --> 00:06:33,434
-66% protection."
-[laughing]

147
00:06:33,518 --> 00:06:36,854
"Three masks are like 97% protection."

148
00:06:36,938 --> 00:06:39,649
-And then a plastic bag, just 100%.
-[laughing]

149
00:06:39,732 --> 00:06:43,736
Just kill yourself.
Just… [grunts] asphyxiate.

150
00:06:44,529 --> 00:06:46,864
"Oh, no, we lost another one to COVID!"

151
00:06:46,948 --> 00:06:47,782
[laughing]

152
00:06:47,865 --> 00:06:48,950
"Nah, bro,

153
00:06:49,033 --> 00:06:51,577
one more bag, bro. He killed himself."

154
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:53,496
[laughing]

155
00:06:54,539 --> 00:06:55,581
[huffs]

156
00:06:56,582 --> 00:06:58,167
"Stay home. We figured it out."

157
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,627
"Stay home." "How long?"

158
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:01,420
"I don't know." [laughs]

159
00:07:01,504 --> 00:07:04,090
-"Monthses, I think."
-[laughing]

160
00:07:04,173 --> 00:07:05,216
"How many monthses?"

161
00:07:05,299 --> 00:07:07,844
-"Just monthses, bro, I don't know."
-[laughing]

162
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,137
"It's gonna be monthses."

163
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,430
-"How many monthses?" "We don't know."
-[laughing]

164
00:07:11,514 --> 00:07:14,100
"You're supposed to know." "I know."

165
00:07:14,183 --> 00:07:15,643
"But we don't know."

166
00:07:15,726 --> 00:07:17,311
"It's monthses. Just stay home." "Well,

167
00:07:17,395 --> 00:07:19,147
I have to go to work."

168
00:07:19,230 --> 00:07:20,440
"Fuck your job," they said.

169
00:07:20,523 --> 00:07:21,566
[laughing]

170
00:07:21,649 --> 00:07:23,276
"Fuck your job."

171
00:07:23,359 --> 00:07:25,278
"What do you mean, fuck my job?"

172
00:07:25,361 --> 00:07:26,529
"I don't have to pay rent?"

173
00:07:26,612 --> 00:07:28,281
-"Whoa, hold on, take it easy."
-[laughing]

174
00:07:28,364 --> 00:07:30,491
"Capitalism. Take it easy."

175
00:07:30,575 --> 00:07:32,493
"You still have to pay your rent."

176
00:07:32,577 --> 00:07:34,662
"Oh, so, hold on,
but then I have to go to--

177
00:07:34,745 --> 00:07:35,705
well, then, send me money.

178
00:07:35,788 --> 00:07:37,623
You know what just send me money."

179
00:07:37,707 --> 00:07:39,459
"No, whoa, what are you,
a crackhead, bro?"

180
00:07:39,542 --> 00:07:41,043
[laughing]

181
00:07:41,127 --> 00:07:43,421
"We can't send you money if-- if--"

182
00:07:43,504 --> 00:07:45,756
"What are you talking about? We can't

183
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:47,967
send you--"
"Why you stuttering a lot, bro?"

184
00:07:48,050 --> 00:07:51,220
"Just send me this money."
"We-- we don't have any money, okay."

185
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:52,263
[soft laughing]

186
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:54,015
"We don't have any--"
"What are you talking about?"

187
00:07:54,098 --> 00:07:56,726
"We send you money,
but that's how this works, okay."

188
00:07:56,809 --> 00:07:58,895
"We send you money and you allocate it

189
00:07:58,978 --> 00:08:01,731
for different buckets.
Right. You got Social security,

190
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:04,650
you got Medicare, Medicaid,
there's a lot of buckets."

191
00:08:04,734 --> 00:08:06,486
"And I'm sure you have a rainy day fund."

192
00:08:06,569 --> 00:08:08,738
"Bro, you gotta have a rainy day fund."

193
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:10,907
"And it's pouring outside."

194
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:14,035
-"Fucking full blown hurricane season."
-[laughing]

195
00:08:14,118 --> 00:08:16,537
"Seven hurricanes
hitting at the same time."

196
00:08:16,621 --> 00:08:18,164
"Send me some fucking money."

197
00:08:18,247 --> 00:08:21,292
-"I have a confession, we're broke. Okay."
-[laughing]

198
00:08:21,375 --> 00:08:23,794
"What do you mean you're broke?
You're the federal government."

199
00:08:23,878 --> 00:08:25,379
[laughs] "I know, I know."

200
00:08:25,463 --> 00:08:27,423
I know, we're in debt, okay." [chuckles]

201
00:08:27,507 --> 00:08:30,343
-"We're in debt, all right, it's--"
-[laughing]

202
00:08:30,426 --> 00:08:32,553
"It's a lot of-- it's debt, okay."

203
00:08:32,637 --> 00:08:34,972
"How much debt?"
"We're just minus okay. We're just…"

204
00:08:35,056 --> 00:08:36,474
[laughing]

205
00:08:36,557 --> 00:08:39,227
"We're just--"
"I know what debt means, bro, just

206
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,729
how much minus?" "It's a lot of minuses."

207
00:08:41,812 --> 00:08:42,772
[laughing]

208
00:08:42,855 --> 00:08:45,525
"So much minus. A lot of minus."

209
00:08:45,608 --> 00:08:47,985
"Just spit it out. How much is it?"

210
00:08:48,069 --> 00:08:49,487
"Twenty trillion dollars."

211
00:08:49,570 --> 00:08:50,488
[laughing]

212
00:08:50,571 --> 00:08:52,323
"Twenty trillion dollars?"

213
00:08:52,406 --> 00:08:54,283
"Who's balancing this cheque book?"

214
00:08:54,367 --> 00:08:55,201
[laughing]

215
00:08:55,284 --> 00:08:59,372
"MC Hammer? Who's managing
this whole situation?"

216
00:09:00,456 --> 00:09:03,793
"How did you get
20 trillion dollars minus?"

217
00:09:03,876 --> 00:09:07,421
-"Killing Brown people is so expensive."
-[audience cries out in surprise]

218
00:09:07,505 --> 00:09:09,465
"Oh!"

219
00:09:09,549 --> 00:09:12,385
"It's so expensive."

220
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:16,055
[loud sigh] "Just so much. So

221
00:09:16,138 --> 00:09:19,141
as you can see, we can't send you money."

222
00:09:19,225 --> 00:09:22,687
"If we're in minus.
Overdraft fees are piling up. We can't…

223
00:09:22,770 --> 00:09:23,604
[laughing]

224
00:09:23,688 --> 00:09:26,440
send you out of minus." [laughs]

225
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:27,733
"What, Kyle?"

226
00:09:27,817 --> 00:09:29,860
"The stock market is gonna fail?"

227
00:09:29,944 --> 00:09:32,446
"Holy shit, Kyle. Heat up the printer."

228
00:09:32,530 --> 00:09:34,532
-"Heat up the fucking printer."
-[laughing]

229
00:09:34,615 --> 00:09:37,201
"Make three trillion dollars appear."

230
00:09:37,285 --> 00:09:40,830
"And let's funnel it into the
Ponzi scheme that is the stock market."

231
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:42,164
[soft laughing]

232
00:09:42,248 --> 00:09:45,126
Because the stock market
is a direct reflection

233
00:09:45,209 --> 00:09:47,378
of American hearts everywhere.

234
00:09:47,461 --> 00:09:49,088
If the arrow's going down that means

235
00:09:49,171 --> 00:09:53,217
hearts and souls of Americans
everywhere is also going down.

236
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,428
"But look it's working, it's going up!"

237
00:09:55,511 --> 00:09:57,597
"Americans are happy again."

238
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:58,681
-"It's going up."
-[laughing]

239
00:09:58,764 --> 00:10:00,016
"It's sky rocketing!"

240
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:03,019
"Wait, wait, wait.
How the fuck is it sky rocketing?"

241
00:10:03,102 --> 00:10:05,646
"We're all at home. I thought…"

242
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:06,939
[laughing]

243
00:10:07,023 --> 00:10:08,691
-I…
-[laughing and applause]

244
00:10:08,774 --> 00:10:09,609
"How is it…"

245
00:10:09,692 --> 00:10:12,820
[soft laughing and applause]

246
00:10:12,903 --> 00:10:14,488
"How…"

247
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,282
"How is this thing going up?"

248
00:10:16,365 --> 00:10:18,868
"I thought it was all
based off of revenue streams

249
00:10:18,951 --> 00:10:20,494
and quarterly earnings.

250
00:10:20,578 --> 00:10:22,163
And nobody's working."

251
00:10:22,246 --> 00:10:23,873
"I get Amazon. Shit." [laughs]

252
00:10:23,956 --> 00:10:27,168
"Everybody is at home ordering,
this should be sky rocketing."

253
00:10:27,251 --> 00:10:28,544
"Well, fuck you, Jeff Bezos,

254
00:10:28,628 --> 00:10:30,838
and thank you,
Jeff Bezos, all at the same time.

255
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,090
"Like, but how
is this still going up, bro?"

256
00:10:33,174 --> 00:10:36,427
"I thought this was all based off
of money coming in. Everybody's at home."

257
00:10:36,510 --> 00:10:38,304
-"Look man, shut the fuck up, okay!"
-[laughing]

258
00:10:38,387 --> 00:10:40,973
"Just look at the arrow.
God, can't you just shut shut your mouth

259
00:10:41,057 --> 00:10:43,059
and just be happy
that the arrow's going up?"

260
00:10:43,142 --> 00:10:45,561
"No, I can't, bro. We need money."

261
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,772
"Look here's $1,200. Hush money."

262
00:10:47,855 --> 00:10:49,649
"Shut the fuck up."

263
00:10:49,732 --> 00:10:52,401
[laughing and applause]

264
00:10:53,778 --> 00:10:56,864
"Thank you. That'll last me a week.
I appreciate that." [laughs]

265
00:10:56,947 --> 00:10:58,199
"Stop trying to distract me."

266
00:10:58,282 --> 00:11:00,701
"How the fuck
is this arrow going up, though, for real?"

267
00:11:00,785 --> 00:11:02,745
"Homelessness is at an all-time high."

268
00:11:02,828 --> 00:11:05,122
"Look, aliens are real.
Chew on that for a little bit."

269
00:11:05,206 --> 00:11:06,499
"What?"

270
00:11:06,582 --> 00:11:07,667
[laughing]

271
00:11:07,750 --> 00:11:11,128
"You talk to them?"
"Yeah, bro, all the time, it's crazy."

272
00:11:11,212 --> 00:11:14,840
"Just look at the arrow, all right."
"No, still, like, so many unemployed."

273
00:11:14,924 --> 00:11:17,510
"Fifty million people unemployed.
How the fuck

274
00:11:17,593 --> 00:11:20,679
is the arrow going up, bro?" "Look,

275
00:11:20,763 --> 00:11:21,889
Jada cheated on Will Smith.

276
00:11:21,972 --> 00:11:23,641
-Chew on that for a little bit."
-[laughing]

277
00:11:23,724 --> 00:11:25,059
"What?"

278
00:11:25,142 --> 00:11:27,353
"Why, Jada, why?"

279
00:11:27,436 --> 00:11:28,354
[laughing]

280
00:11:28,437 --> 00:11:29,271
"What happened?"

281
00:11:29,355 --> 00:11:32,191
"Something about entanglements,
I don't know, it's crazy."

282
00:11:32,274 --> 00:11:33,609
"Just look at the arrow."

283
00:11:33,692 --> 00:11:34,860
"Just look at the fucking arrow."

284
00:11:34,944 --> 00:11:37,863
"No, for real, stop trying
to distract me, bro. How is this arrow

285
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:40,032
still going up, okay?
Please explain yourself."

286
00:11:40,116 --> 00:11:42,159
"Look, I've got a hot tip for you, okay."

287
00:11:42,243 --> 00:11:43,452
"Cryptocurrency."

288
00:11:43,536 --> 00:11:44,453
[laughing]

289
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,455
"What the fuck is cryptocurrency?"

290
00:11:47,039 --> 00:11:49,750
"It's these little people
inside of a computer."

291
00:11:49,834 --> 00:11:52,128
"And they're just mining.
They're just mining

292
00:11:52,211 --> 00:11:54,130
for these digital coins, okay."

293
00:11:54,213 --> 00:11:57,007
"What you do is,
you move the real fake money

294
00:11:57,091 --> 00:11:58,467
over to the…

295
00:11:58,551 --> 00:11:59,510
[laughing]

296
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:01,137
over to the more real fake money."

297
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:02,972
-[laughing]
-"And what you do is, you just move, once

298
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:06,058
you have more real fake money,
you move your real fake money over here"

299
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:07,143
"and you just keep doing that."

300
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,270
"I'm so confused."

301
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:11,939
"Hey, man, I've got
another hot tip for you. NFT's."

302
00:12:12,022 --> 00:12:14,108
-"What the fuck is a NFT?"
-[shouts and laughing]

303
00:12:14,191 --> 00:12:15,359
[applause]

304
00:12:15,443 --> 00:12:17,862
"It's a blockchain of ownership…"

305
00:12:17,945 --> 00:12:19,905
"You know what, I'm just gonna put
a plastic bag over my head.

306
00:12:19,989 --> 00:12:21,031
Fuck this shit."

307
00:12:21,115 --> 00:12:22,199
[laughing and applause]

308
00:12:22,283 --> 00:12:25,953
[cheering]

309
00:12:27,204 --> 00:12:28,664
Is it real?

310
00:12:29,957 --> 00:12:31,292
COVID's real.

311
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:34,628
I had it. Dave Chappelle
gave me COVID. That's right.

312
00:12:34,712 --> 00:12:36,380
[laughing]

313
00:12:36,464 --> 00:12:37,923
Well, that was the second time.

314
00:12:38,007 --> 00:12:38,883
[laughing]

315
00:12:38,966 --> 00:12:42,344
But the first time, he hits me up
right at the beginning of the pandemic.

316
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,096
He's like, "Say, Mo, what are you doing?"

317
00:12:44,180 --> 00:12:46,765
I'm like, "I don't know
if you've been watching the news, bro."

318
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,392
"I'm at home, dog, that's what I'm doing."

319
00:12:48,476 --> 00:12:49,393
[laughing]

320
00:12:49,477 --> 00:12:52,521
"That's what you do. We're all at home.
I don't know if you were watching."

321
00:12:52,605 --> 00:12:54,482
He was like,
"Yeah, you can't let them break us."

322
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,900
I'm like, "We're broken, bro."

323
00:12:55,983 --> 00:12:57,401
"The whole country

324
00:12:57,485 --> 00:12:59,236
is broken."

325
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:00,779
He was like,
"That's why I'm hitting you up."

326
00:13:00,863 --> 00:13:04,283
"I'm gonna do these shows
out in this cornfield in Ohio."

327
00:13:04,366 --> 00:13:07,536
I was like, "I don't know, man,
this doesn't sound very, I'm not sure,

328
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:08,871
you know." He was like, "No, no."

329
00:13:08,954 --> 00:13:11,582
"We're gonna
test everybody every three days."

330
00:13:11,665 --> 00:13:13,250
"It's gonna be very safe.
We're gonna do the best we can.

331
00:13:13,334 --> 00:13:14,585
Nothing is guaranteed, of course."

332
00:13:14,668 --> 00:13:16,212
"We're gonna do
the best that we can, every--"

333
00:13:16,295 --> 00:13:19,507
I was like,
"You have testing machines, bro? This is

334
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,592
the beginning of the pandemic."

335
00:13:21,675 --> 00:13:22,510
[laughing]

336
00:13:22,593 --> 00:13:25,429
"Like, how did you get testing machines?"
He just went nuts,

337
00:13:25,513 --> 00:13:27,223
He was like,
"Say, nigga, I'm Dave Chappelle.

338
00:13:27,306 --> 00:13:28,474
Of course I got these--"

339
00:13:28,557 --> 00:13:29,683
[cheering and applause]

340
00:13:29,767 --> 00:13:31,268
I was like, "Good point."

341
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,187
Really good point.

342
00:13:34,313 --> 00:13:37,566
So we go, I go to Ohio.

343
00:13:37,650 --> 00:13:39,860
And it was a amazing run of shows, like,

344
00:13:39,944 --> 00:13:43,072
almost four months of doing these shows.

345
00:13:43,155 --> 00:13:44,365
And we almost made it, but

346
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,534
we had outbreaks and we had to stop it.

347
00:13:46,617 --> 00:13:48,452
And he made it into a documentary film.

348
00:13:48,536 --> 00:13:50,579
It's an incredible documentary film.

349
00:13:50,663 --> 00:13:53,249
I saw it at Radio City Music Hall.

350
00:13:53,332 --> 00:13:55,251
It was the first time
that I got to see it.

351
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:57,378
And then I watched it
and I was like, "Wait,

352
00:13:57,461 --> 00:13:59,838
the end of the movie makes it look like

353
00:13:59,922 --> 00:14:02,216
I ruined the whole fucking party."

354
00:14:02,299 --> 00:14:03,133
[laughing]

355
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:06,136
I got COVID
and the whole thing had to shut down

356
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:07,680
because I was being a bitch.

357
00:14:07,763 --> 00:14:09,181
I was like, "Wait, hold on a second."

358
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,724
I walked up to Dave. I'm like, "Dave,

359
00:14:10,808 --> 00:14:12,810
the way you edited this, you made it look

360
00:14:12,893 --> 00:14:15,062
that Mohammed
was the villain in the whole situation."

361
00:14:15,145 --> 00:14:15,980
[laughing]

362
00:14:16,063 --> 00:14:17,773
"That's not the truth, bro. I didn't do--"

363
00:14:17,856 --> 00:14:19,858
He's like, "Ah, man,
nobody's gonna think this."

364
00:14:19,942 --> 00:14:21,610
And right after he walks away

365
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:22,945
Bradley Cooper walks up.

366
00:14:23,028 --> 00:14:25,364
He's like, "Man, this is
really fucked up how you just

367
00:14:25,447 --> 00:14:26,490
-ruined the…
-[laughing]

368
00:14:26,574 --> 00:14:28,367
ruined the party in Ohio."

369
00:14:28,450 --> 00:14:29,743
I was like, "It wasn't me."

370
00:14:29,827 --> 00:14:32,830
"An award-winning film maker is saying
that this is what it looks like."

371
00:14:32,913 --> 00:14:35,457
"Oh, no!" And it wasn't my fault.

372
00:14:35,541 --> 00:14:38,085
It was this tiny little lady.
She was really small.

373
00:14:38,168 --> 00:14:40,421
-And she was handsy. Really handsy.
-[laughing]

374
00:14:40,504 --> 00:14:43,090
And she was touching me all the time.
"Hi, Mo." [giggles]

375
00:14:43,173 --> 00:14:44,258
-"Hi."
-[laughing]

376
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:45,634
Just doing this all the time.

377
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:47,386
I'm like, "Hey,
stop touching me right now."

378
00:14:47,469 --> 00:14:51,056
"First of all, it's a pandemic.
Like, I don't you that well enough"

379
00:14:51,140 --> 00:14:52,725
"and stop touching me, like--"

380
00:14:52,808 --> 00:14:55,436
And then she fake-coughed in my face.

381
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:57,062
[fake coughs] Like this.

382
00:14:57,146 --> 00:14:59,565
And I was like,
"I love dark humor, but that's--

383
00:14:59,648 --> 00:15:01,483
-[laughing]
-That's not funny!"

384
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:04,320
"It's not funny, bitch. It's not funny."

385
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,573
And then she tested positive
three days later.

386
00:15:07,656 --> 00:15:08,616
[audience sympathizes]

387
00:15:08,699 --> 00:15:11,035
I was like,
"I knew she was Israeli. I knew it."

388
00:15:11,118 --> 00:15:14,413
-[laughing and applause]
-I knew it.

389
00:15:14,496 --> 00:15:15,706
I knew it.

390
00:15:19,793 --> 00:15:22,129
They were having a meeting in Hollywood.

391
00:15:22,212 --> 00:15:25,049
They were like, "This Palestinian's
getting too powerful."

392
00:15:25,132 --> 00:15:26,216
[laughing]

393
00:15:26,300 --> 00:15:29,011
"Just send him
this unassuming little gremlin

394
00:15:29,094 --> 00:15:31,221
to try and kill him with COVID."

395
00:15:31,805 --> 00:15:33,807
I survived, bitch! I survived!

396
00:15:33,891 --> 00:15:35,100
[laughing]

397
00:15:35,184 --> 00:15:37,269
That was the first time I got COVID.

398
00:15:37,353 --> 00:15:38,354
[laughing]

399
00:15:38,437 --> 00:15:39,521
The second time,

400
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,148
Dave Chappelle calls me again.

401
00:15:41,231 --> 00:15:42,107
[laughing]

402
00:15:42,191 --> 00:15:43,525
Saying, "Man, what you doing?"

403
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:45,611
I'm like, "I'm recovering from COVID."

404
00:15:45,694 --> 00:15:47,196
[laughing]

405
00:15:48,197 --> 00:15:49,740
He's like, "I'm gonna do these shows

406
00:15:49,823 --> 00:15:52,076
in Austin. Joe Rogan is gonna be on it."

407
00:15:52,159 --> 00:15:53,202
"It's gonna be dope."

408
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:56,956
"You should join." I'm like, "Dave,
I don't know if this really worked out

409
00:15:57,039 --> 00:15:58,707
for me the first time."

410
00:15:58,791 --> 00:16:00,250
[laughing]

411
00:16:00,334 --> 00:16:01,835
And he was like, "Nah, man,
this is gonna be different."

412
00:16:01,919 --> 00:16:03,462
"We gonna test every day."

413
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:06,632
"Last time we were only testing every
three days. We're gonna test every day."

414
00:16:06,715 --> 00:16:07,925
"So we gonna catch that ho

415
00:16:08,008 --> 00:16:09,218
and put her in a closet."

416
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,219
[laughing]

417
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:13,055
"You'd be straight."
I was like, "Fuck it, let's do it."

418
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:15,099
-[huffs]
-[laughing]

419
00:16:15,182 --> 00:16:17,101
We're like ten days into doing shows

420
00:16:17,184 --> 00:16:19,061
and Dave walks up to me
and he's like, "Hey, man,

421
00:16:19,144 --> 00:16:21,021
I got this joint from Jay-Z."

422
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:22,064
I was like, "Word?"

423
00:16:22,147 --> 00:16:24,274
He was like,
"Yeah, I got this joint from Jay-Z."

424
00:16:24,358 --> 00:16:25,442
I was like, "Jay-Z's here?"

425
00:16:25,526 --> 00:16:27,653
He was like, "Nah, man,
Jay-Z has a weed company

426
00:16:27,736 --> 00:16:29,279
and he sent me these joints."

427
00:16:29,363 --> 00:16:30,572
[laughing]

428
00:16:30,656 --> 00:16:34,201
"You wanna go? Let's go roll around
your car and let's smoke this together."

429
00:16:34,284 --> 00:16:37,204
I'm like, "Shit, Dave Chappelle
has a joint from Jay-Z

430
00:16:37,287 --> 00:16:39,415
asking Mo Amer
if he wants to smoke this shit,

431
00:16:39,498 --> 00:16:42,292
you're damn right, I'm gonna smoke
the shit out of this joint."

432
00:16:42,376 --> 00:16:43,919
[cheering and applause]

433
00:16:44,003 --> 00:16:45,254
Obvious.

434
00:16:48,841 --> 00:16:51,301
So then we're cruising
and then he lights up the joint.

435
00:16:51,385 --> 00:16:52,469
And I should've known better!

436
00:16:52,553 --> 00:16:56,015
Because he took a hit
and then he goes… [coughs] like this.

437
00:16:56,098 --> 00:16:58,183
[laughing]

438
00:16:58,267 --> 00:16:59,476
I was like, "You okay, Dave?"

439
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,270
He was like, "Yeah, yeah, I'm fine."

440
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:04,523
"I'm fine. This Jay-Z weed
makes you do Jay-Z impressions like…"

441
00:17:04,606 --> 00:17:06,567
[coughs] "Djeah!"

442
00:17:06,650 --> 00:17:08,986
[cheering and applause]

443
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:14,950
I took the joint. I took a couple of hits.
I was like, [coughs]

444
00:17:15,034 --> 00:17:16,952
-"… djeah-hova!" [chuckles]
-[laughing]

445
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,495
Smoke it.

446
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,664
We laughed. It was a great ride.

447
00:17:20,748 --> 00:17:24,334
And then I dropped Dave off because
it was like 30 minutes until show time.

448
00:17:24,418 --> 00:17:26,795
And then I started texting him,
I was like, "Say, bro,

449
00:17:26,879 --> 00:17:28,130
you want me to swoop you up?"

450
00:17:28,213 --> 00:17:30,549
"Is there special guests,
should I come later?"

451
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:32,843
And he went silent.
And I was like, "This is weird."

452
00:17:32,926 --> 00:17:35,512
"Dave, we just dropped you off, bro.
This is really odd."

453
00:17:35,596 --> 00:17:36,805
And then friends

454
00:17:36,889 --> 00:17:39,266
started texting me. They haven't
heard from him in, like, weeks.

455
00:17:39,349 --> 00:17:41,351
They were like, "Hey, man, is Dave okay?"

456
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:42,603
I'm like, "Yeah, Dave's okay."

457
00:17:42,686 --> 00:17:44,521
"You don't know him, that's my boy."

458
00:17:44,605 --> 00:17:46,106
-[laughing]
-"What are you talking about?"

459
00:17:46,190 --> 00:17:47,024
"We just hanging out."

460
00:17:47,107 --> 00:17:48,525
And then they sent me a link.

461
00:17:48,609 --> 00:17:49,860
I was like, "What is this link?"

462
00:17:49,943 --> 00:17:51,904
So I touched the link and it opens up.

463
00:17:51,987 --> 00:17:54,364
And it's TMZ front page news,

464
00:17:54,448 --> 00:17:56,992
"Dave Chappelle tests positive for COVID."

465
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:57,910
[sympathy from audience]

466
00:17:57,993 --> 00:17:59,536
Then I was like, "This can't be true!"

467
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:01,580
And then I was like, "Shit,

468
00:18:01,663 --> 00:18:04,166
It's TMZ, they're always right,
these motherfuckers."

469
00:18:04,249 --> 00:18:05,084
[laughing]

470
00:18:05,167 --> 00:18:07,377
I was like,
"How did they know before I knew?"

471
00:18:07,461 --> 00:18:09,379
"I just dropped off Dave."

472
00:18:09,463 --> 00:18:11,632
"He called them before he called me."

473
00:18:11,715 --> 00:18:13,717
"Fuck. That's fucked up, bro."

474
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:15,344
And then he tried to deny it.

475
00:18:15,427 --> 00:18:16,303
I walked up to him and I was like,

476
00:18:16,386 --> 00:18:19,098
"Dave, it's fucked up you gave me
COVID a second time."

477
00:18:19,181 --> 00:18:22,434
And he goes, "There's no way
to really prove that, Mo."

478
00:18:22,518 --> 00:18:23,894
[laughing]

479
00:18:24,728 --> 00:18:25,813
[laughs]

480
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:28,565
I was like,
"Bro, the first day you tested positive

481
00:18:28,649 --> 00:18:30,567
I was smoking a joint with you."

482
00:18:30,651 --> 00:18:32,986
"Minutes before you tested positive."

483
00:18:33,070 --> 00:18:35,155
And he got silent and he just goes,

484
00:18:36,573 --> 00:18:38,659
-"I'm sorry I gave you COVID, bro."
-[laughing]

485
00:18:38,742 --> 00:18:40,702
[huffs]

486
00:18:42,287 --> 00:18:44,790
And then he goes,
"Walk it off, at least it's not AIDS."

487
00:18:44,873 --> 00:18:46,375
And he's just walking around like this.

488
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:48,794
[laughing and applause]

489
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:52,756
[Mo laughs]

490
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:54,216
Is it over? [chuckles]

491
00:18:54,299 --> 00:18:55,217
Is it?

492
00:18:55,300 --> 00:18:59,972
-[grunts and laughs]
-[laughing]

493
00:19:00,055 --> 00:19:01,306
[laughs]

494
00:19:03,934 --> 00:19:07,146
So I am done. I had that shit twice. Okay.

495
00:19:07,229 --> 00:19:09,857
Fauci, "Only seven people in the world

496
00:19:09,940 --> 00:19:11,650
have ever gotten it twi--"

497
00:19:11,733 --> 00:19:12,693
Bullshit!

498
00:19:12,776 --> 00:19:15,696
I'm special,
but I'm not that fucking special, Fauci.

499
00:19:15,779 --> 00:19:16,613
[laughing]

500
00:19:16,697 --> 00:19:18,574
So I'm done. I had it twice.

501
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,450
And I'm vaccinated. I'm over it.

502
00:19:20,534 --> 00:19:22,661
I'm over it. I got the Pfizer vaccine.

503
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:23,579
-[cheering]
-That's what I want.

504
00:19:23,662 --> 00:19:26,039
Everybody has their favorites,
but I went with Pfizer. I want…

505
00:19:26,123 --> 00:19:27,249
[laughing]

506
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:29,376
I want like a German scientist
making my shit,

507
00:19:29,459 --> 00:19:30,544
-you know what I'm saying?
-[laughing]

508
00:19:30,627 --> 00:19:31,503
I want the guy like,

509
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,881
[in fake German accent]
"Yavi, hows the Pfizer? Ya!"

510
00:19:34,464 --> 00:19:36,925
"We knew he was coming out of Wuhan."

511
00:19:37,009 --> 00:19:39,803
"The COVID.
And we are way ahead of schedule."

512
00:19:39,887 --> 00:19:42,055
"Ya! We have the vaccine! The Pfizer!"

513
00:19:42,139 --> 00:19:44,558
-That's the one I want. That's what I--
-[cheering and applause]

514
00:19:44,641 --> 00:19:45,684
The what?

515
00:19:45,767 --> 00:19:47,060
[cheering and applause]

516
00:19:47,144 --> 00:19:48,103
"Yaza!" [chuckles]

517
00:19:48,187 --> 00:19:50,981
"Hmm, ya, iz good, ya,
we have the Pfizer."

518
00:19:51,064 --> 00:19:52,149
-[chuckles]
-[laughing]

519
00:19:52,232 --> 00:19:54,568
-"You have the Pfizer? I have the Pfizer."
-[laughing]

520
00:19:54,651 --> 00:19:55,986
[chuckles]

521
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,947
I'm not doing Johnson & Johnson.
I'm not doing that.

522
00:19:59,031 --> 00:20:00,115
[huffs]

523
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,492
I don't even use their regular products.

524
00:20:02,576 --> 00:20:04,161
[laughing]

525
00:20:04,244 --> 00:20:07,039
And they make too many
for my comfort, bro.

526
00:20:07,122 --> 00:20:07,956
[laughing]

527
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:10,876
You want me to tell you like,
"What's in the Johnson & Johnson?"

528
00:20:10,959 --> 00:20:12,461
"I don't know, man, like we just

529
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:15,214
started off with
a little snake venom in there."

530
00:20:15,297 --> 00:20:16,131
[laughing]

531
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,884
"And then we just added some
Johnson & Johnson baby powder

532
00:20:18,967 --> 00:20:20,761
-to thicken it up a bit."
-[laughing]

533
00:20:20,844 --> 00:20:23,305
"Some Johnson & Johnson baby oil

534
00:20:23,388 --> 00:20:25,724
to loosen her up a bit."

535
00:20:25,807 --> 00:20:27,768
"Then we put a goddamn baby in there."

536
00:20:27,851 --> 00:20:30,103
-[laughing]
-"Just a whole fucking baby."

537
00:20:30,187 --> 00:20:34,024
"And we finished it off with
a little wild turkey to give it that pop!"

538
00:20:34,107 --> 00:20:35,150
"Know what I mean?"

539
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,361
[laughing and applause]

540
00:20:39,154 --> 00:20:40,280
"How many shots do I take?"

541
00:20:40,364 --> 00:20:42,491
"No shots, we just pass it
mouth to mouth."

542
00:20:42,574 --> 00:20:43,742
"You just come on now…"

543
00:20:43,825 --> 00:20:46,119
-[laughs]
-[laughing and applause]

544
00:20:46,203 --> 00:20:48,121
It's so absurd. I-- [huffs]

545
00:20:48,205 --> 00:20:49,957
It's so absurd, like-- [huffs]

546
00:20:50,040 --> 00:20:53,293
Like, vaccines having accents
is so ab-- [chuckles]

547
00:20:53,377 --> 00:20:55,587
What's Moder-- [huffs] What's Moderna?

548
00:20:55,671 --> 00:20:58,465
[imitating Mexican accent]

549
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:01,468
-[laughing]
-"You got that derna, bro?"

550
00:21:01,551 --> 00:21:04,012
"We give you one shot then you Crip Walk
out this bitch."

551
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,722
You know what I mean.
Like, bra, lets do it?"

552
00:21:05,806 --> 00:21:07,266
[laughing] Like I'm g--

553
00:21:07,349 --> 00:21:09,017
[chuckles] That derna.

554
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:10,936
[chuckles]

555
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:15,983
-[grunts and exhales sharply]
-[laughing]

556
00:21:17,484 --> 00:21:18,318
Fuck!

557
00:21:18,402 --> 00:21:19,236
[laughing]

558
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,196
That's how I feel inside.

559
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,531
[soft laughing]

560
00:21:24,491 --> 00:21:27,327
I do. That's how I feel inside.
All the time. Fuck.

561
00:21:27,411 --> 00:21:28,370
[laughing]

562
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:30,247
All the time. I'm just…

563
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:31,790
[grunts] fuck.

564
00:21:31,873 --> 00:21:32,708
[laughing]

565
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:34,084
[grunts] Fuck.

566
00:21:34,167 --> 00:21:37,838
And fuck is just not a potent enough word,
to be honest with you.

567
00:21:37,921 --> 00:21:39,214
It's not strong.

568
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,633
Once you speak another language,

569
00:21:41,717 --> 00:21:43,218
you realize,

570
00:21:43,302 --> 00:21:45,887
you realize that the English language

571
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:47,931
is just like a newborn, you know.

572
00:21:48,015 --> 00:21:48,849
[laughing]

573
00:21:48,932 --> 00:21:51,101
It is. It's a new language.

574
00:21:51,184 --> 00:21:53,562
Like, I speak Arabic.
Arabic is an ancient language.

575
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:54,479
[sighs]

576
00:21:54,563 --> 00:21:57,482
English is like it's baby.
It wants to grow up

577
00:21:57,566 --> 00:21:59,234
and be Arabic one day and it's just…

578
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:00,235
[laughing]

579
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,945
It is, it's just…

580
00:22:02,029 --> 00:22:04,323
-[cheering and applause]
-No, it's fine.

581
00:22:05,615 --> 00:22:08,702
It's just a baby.
It's just a baby. It's not a--

582
00:22:08,785 --> 00:22:11,330
It lacks a lot of depth. It's just not,

583
00:22:11,413 --> 00:22:13,081
it's just not very strong, like "fuck",

584
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,751
it's nothing.
It's an exclamation point, you know.

585
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:17,711
Even greetings in Arabic

586
00:22:17,794 --> 00:22:19,713
-takes so long, you know.
-[soft laughing]

587
00:22:19,796 --> 00:22:22,132
Greetings are like, "Peace be upon you."

588
00:22:22,215 --> 00:22:24,092
"And may peace be upon you."

589
00:22:24,176 --> 00:22:26,803
"And the mercy of the divine be upon you."

590
00:22:26,887 --> 00:22:29,264
"And may the mercy
of the divine be upon you."

591
00:22:29,348 --> 00:22:31,516
"And may divine light be with you."

592
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,393
"May it be unto you as well."

593
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:35,729
"May it protect you
and your entire linea--"

594
00:22:35,812 --> 00:22:38,774
"Hey, man, can I get this pack
of cigarettes, bro, and get out of here?"

595
00:22:38,857 --> 00:22:40,108
[laughing and applause]

596
00:22:41,026 --> 00:22:41,985
It's a lot.

597
00:22:43,070 --> 00:22:45,322
It's a lot.
In English, it's, "Hi." [laughs]

598
00:22:45,405 --> 00:22:46,782
-That's it. It's over.
-[laughing]

599
00:22:46,865 --> 00:22:47,824
[chuckles]

600
00:22:47,908 --> 00:22:49,076
It's over. [chuckles]

601
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:51,369
"What's up? The sky?" [mock giggles]

602
00:22:51,453 --> 00:22:54,289
That's it, there's nothing else. [laughs]

603
00:22:54,372 --> 00:22:55,248
It's nothing.

604
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:58,251
[laughs]

605
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:02,005
So when somebody curses you in English,

606
00:23:02,089 --> 00:23:04,466
sincerely, you could probably walk away

607
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:07,177
99.9% of the time

608
00:23:07,260 --> 00:23:10,097
if you didn't get emotionally charged.

609
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,765
Really. It's an oldie but a goodie.

610
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,433
"Hey, fuck you!"

611
00:23:13,517 --> 00:23:14,851
"I don't wanna fuck you."

612
00:23:14,935 --> 00:23:17,479
-[laughing]
-And you could, just walk away.

613
00:23:17,562 --> 00:23:18,396
[soft laughing]

614
00:23:18,980 --> 00:23:20,524
"Hey, go fuck yourself!"

615
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:23,860
"You know what, man?
I've been really tense lately."

616
00:23:23,944 --> 00:23:26,571
[laughing]

617
00:23:26,655 --> 00:23:29,533
"And maybe
what I need to do is go fuck myself."

618
00:23:29,616 --> 00:23:31,118
[laughing]

619
00:23:31,201 --> 00:23:32,327
"Hey, you're a motherfucker."

620
00:23:33,078 --> 00:23:34,746
"Not my mom, but…"

621
00:23:34,830 --> 00:23:36,540
[laughing]

622
00:23:36,623 --> 00:23:39,501
"My ex-wife
did have child from a previous marriage,

623
00:23:39,584 --> 00:23:40,877
so I guess I am a motherfucker."

624
00:23:40,961 --> 00:23:41,795
[soft laughing]

625
00:23:41,878 --> 00:23:45,841
"And by the way, your father, biggest
motherfucker of them all, technically."

626
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,425
[laughing and a whoop]

627
00:23:47,509 --> 00:23:49,302
"Hey, you're an asshole!"

628
00:23:49,386 --> 00:23:52,097
"You know what,
the eye cannot see itself."

629
00:23:52,180 --> 00:23:53,807
[laughing]

630
00:23:57,727 --> 00:24:00,105
[applause]

631
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,026
"And I cannot see
when I'm being an asshole,

632
00:24:05,110 --> 00:24:06,862
so thank you for
making me a better person."

633
00:24:06,945 --> 00:24:08,405
And just walk away.

634
00:24:08,905 --> 00:24:12,159
"Hey! You're a pussy!"
"Yeah, I'll take that."

635
00:24:12,242 --> 00:24:15,704
I don't know why
"pussy" always insinuates weakness.

636
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:19,791
Pussy is metaphorically
and physically very strong.

637
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:21,251
-[loud cheering]
-So strong!

638
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,378
[cheering and applause]

639
00:24:23,461 --> 00:24:24,796
It's true.

640
00:24:25,714 --> 00:24:27,382
Absolutely true.

641
00:24:27,465 --> 00:24:30,677
It's so strong. It can have a baby.

642
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:32,345
-Human life.
-[whoop]

643
00:24:32,429 --> 00:24:34,306
Pounds of human flesh

644
00:24:34,389 --> 00:24:37,809
can come out of
this little, tiny hole. Pop!

645
00:24:37,893 --> 00:24:40,604
And it can have two at the same time.
Pop! Pop!

646
00:24:40,687 --> 00:24:41,563
[laughing]

647
00:24:41,646 --> 00:24:43,982
-It can have three. Pop, pop, pop.
-[laughing]

648
00:24:44,065 --> 00:24:46,818
-And then it regenerates… like this.
-[laughing]

649
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,779
Almost. Exactly how it was. Almost.

650
00:24:49,863 --> 00:24:51,406
-[laughing]
-Almost. Exactly how it was.

651
00:24:52,199 --> 00:24:55,952
Maybe if you laugh or cough,
you piss on yourself, but otherwise…

652
00:24:56,036 --> 00:24:56,870
[laughing]

653
00:24:56,953 --> 00:24:58,705
Otherwise, it's there.

654
00:24:59,748 --> 00:25:02,334
Ready for you once again. [laughs]

655
00:25:02,417 --> 00:25:03,376
[laughing]

656
00:25:08,256 --> 00:25:09,758
[laughing]

657
00:25:09,841 --> 00:25:11,259
My friend, Chris,

658
00:25:11,343 --> 00:25:13,970
passed a kidney stone
out of his dick hole.

659
00:25:14,054 --> 00:25:14,971
[laughing]

660
00:25:15,055 --> 00:25:17,098
-He damn near died, okay.
-[laughing]

661
00:25:17,182 --> 00:25:20,602
He was like,
"Oh, God, what's happening to me?"

662
00:25:20,685 --> 00:25:23,605
He was like, "Somebody shoot me!"

663
00:25:23,688 --> 00:25:27,317
And it was a grain of sand
that came out of his dick hole.

664
00:25:27,400 --> 00:25:29,945
-Women, "Pop! Pop!" Come back.
-[laughing]

665
00:25:30,028 --> 00:25:32,113
Little grain of sand… [groans]

666
00:25:32,197 --> 00:25:33,073
[laughing]

667
00:25:33,156 --> 00:25:35,951
You be a dick.
I'll be a pussy any day of the week.

668
00:25:36,034 --> 00:25:37,661
[loud cheering and applause]

669
00:25:38,828 --> 00:25:40,956
[cheering and whistling]

670
00:25:43,124 --> 00:25:44,793
Arabic curse words.

671
00:25:44,876 --> 00:25:46,336
[soft laughing]

672
00:25:48,463 --> 00:25:50,131
-They're really graphic.
-[laughing]

673
00:25:51,675 --> 00:25:55,262
They're so graphic I don't even use them.
Honestly, I just…

674
00:25:55,345 --> 00:25:57,138
We're gonna start here and build up.

675
00:25:57,222 --> 00:25:58,598
[laughing]

676
00:25:58,682 --> 00:25:59,975
Like <i>"Kes Emak"</i>,

677
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:01,476
-which means…
-[murmurs]

678
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:03,186
…"Fuck your mother's pussy!"

679
00:26:03,270 --> 00:26:05,063
[laughing]

680
00:26:05,146 --> 00:26:06,564
Very specific.

681
00:26:06,648 --> 00:26:09,150
-[laughing]
-[Mo huffs]

682
00:26:12,487 --> 00:26:14,239
We take that to another level.

683
00:26:14,322 --> 00:26:15,532
<i>"Kes Emak Eli Nafadek"</i>

684
00:26:15,615 --> 00:26:17,325
-which means…
-[laughing]

685
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:20,203
Which me-- two people,
"Yeah, I know what that means."

686
00:26:20,287 --> 00:26:21,329
-[laughing]
-[chuckles]

687
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:22,622
Everybody else is on their toes,

688
00:26:22,706 --> 00:26:24,374
"What does it mean?"

689
00:26:24,457 --> 00:26:26,042
[laughing]

690
00:26:26,126 --> 00:26:27,585
It mea-- <i>"Kes Emak Eli Nafadek"</i>

691
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:28,503
which means,

692
00:26:28,586 --> 00:26:32,007
"Fuck the pussy you slithered out of!"
Wow!

693
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:35,010
-[shocked laughing]
-[Mo laughs]

694
00:26:35,885 --> 00:26:38,054
<i>Astaghfirullah</i> I know, it's crazy.

695
00:26:38,138 --> 00:26:39,014
[laughing]

696
00:26:39,097 --> 00:26:40,265
[indistinct]

697
00:26:40,932 --> 00:26:43,476
Everyone saw the baby fall out.

698
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:45,562
It's a visual curse word, that one.

699
00:26:45,645 --> 00:26:47,147
[laughing]

700
00:26:48,315 --> 00:26:51,026
This is one of my personal favorites,

701
00:26:51,109 --> 00:26:52,652
<i>"Yela3n Tarekhek"</i>,

702
00:26:52,736 --> 00:26:53,570
Which means,

703
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:58,825
which means, "Damn your entire history."

704
00:26:58,908 --> 00:27:00,618
[laughing]

705
00:27:06,416 --> 00:27:08,835
"My great-grandmother?" "No, bitch,

706
00:27:08,918 --> 00:27:10,920
from the beginning of time…"

707
00:27:11,004 --> 00:27:13,006
[laughing]

708
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,804
"…to present day and everything
in between and in the future,

709
00:27:19,888 --> 00:27:21,056
fuck your DNA."

710
00:27:21,139 --> 00:27:22,515
[laughing]

711
00:27:24,726 --> 00:27:28,104
<i>Astaghfirullah</i>, I don't need this.
It's a lot.

712
00:27:29,022 --> 00:27:31,024
Even Western hand gestures.

713
00:27:31,107 --> 00:27:32,442
Not that big of a deal.

714
00:27:32,525 --> 00:27:34,235
-"Uh, fuck you bro, uh."
-[laughing]

715
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:37,405
In England it's a reverse peace sign.
Very confusing.

716
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,367
[in fake English accent] "Oh,
fuck off, oh."

717
00:27:40,450 --> 00:27:42,160
[laughing]

718
00:27:42,243 --> 00:27:44,579
And they try to be like,
"No, it's from the war, yeah."

719
00:27:44,662 --> 00:27:45,830
I'm like, "Shut the fuck up, okay.

720
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:46,748
[laughing]

721
00:27:46,831 --> 00:27:48,166
"It's not that cool."

722
00:27:49,000 --> 00:27:51,169
Arabs, we go to another level.

723
00:27:51,252 --> 00:27:54,255
We go sideways,
we go <i>"BeTizik"</i>, like this.

724
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:55,298
[laughing]

725
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:57,926
<i>BeTizik</i>, like that.

726
00:27:58,009 --> 00:28:00,136
<i>BeTizik</i>, like this.

727
00:28:00,220 --> 00:28:01,471
-A little pop…
-[laughing and applause]

728
00:28:01,554 --> 00:28:03,098
-<i>BeTizik</i>, like that.
-[laughing]

729
00:28:03,181 --> 00:28:05,600
Little wiggle.
<i>BeTizik</i>, like that.

730
00:28:05,683 --> 00:28:07,435
<i>BeTizik</i>, like… [laughs]

731
00:28:07,519 --> 00:28:10,063
This means "in your ass."
That's what this means.

732
00:28:10,146 --> 00:28:11,606
-[laughing]
-That's what… [laughs]

733
00:28:13,358 --> 00:28:14,317
[laughing]

734
00:28:14,401 --> 00:28:18,029
And if there's any confusion,
you just put the other hand up like this

735
00:28:18,113 --> 00:28:19,906
and you go <i>BeTizik</i>, like this.

736
00:28:19,989 --> 00:28:20,824
[laughing]

737
00:28:20,907 --> 00:28:22,409
And you wiggle it.

738
00:28:22,492 --> 00:28:25,453
You wiggle it,
all up in the ass, that's right!

739
00:28:25,537 --> 00:28:28,331
[laughing and applause]

740
00:28:28,415 --> 00:28:30,959
I feel like a lot of people
are gonna be leaving here, like,

741
00:28:31,042 --> 00:28:32,085
"Hey, Kyle." "Yeah."

742
00:28:32,168 --> 00:28:34,170
<i>BeTizik</i> bro!

743
00:28:34,254 --> 00:28:35,130
[laughing]

744
00:28:35,213 --> 00:28:37,424
-[Mo laughs]
-[laughing]

745
00:28:40,510 --> 00:28:41,428
Fuck!

746
00:28:41,511 --> 00:28:42,345
[soft laughing]

747
00:28:42,429 --> 00:28:44,764

749
00:28:48,226 --> 00:28:50,603
[in Mexican accent] ...bro.

750
00:28:50,687 --> 00:28:51,980
[soft laughing]

751
00:28:54,441 --> 00:28:56,568
Mexicano's, bro. I love Mexicano's.

752
00:28:56,651 --> 00:28:58,778
[cheering and applause]

753
00:29:00,488 --> 00:29:03,116
Let me say, growing up in Alief,
you can't…

754
00:29:03,199 --> 00:29:04,075
[whoop and cheers]

755
00:29:04,159 --> 00:29:06,119
we can't. You can't…

756
00:29:06,202 --> 00:29:07,787
You grew up around Mexicano's. You do.

757
00:29:07,871 --> 00:29:09,122
And they always sound like
they're in pain.

758
00:29:09,205 --> 00:29:10,874
[in fake Mexican accent] "Come on, bro,
let's hang out."

759
00:29:10,957 --> 00:29:11,791
[laughing]

760
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:15,128
"You all right?"
"Yeah, I'm doing fine, bro."

761
00:29:15,211 --> 00:29:16,588
"Are you sure?"

762
00:29:16,671 --> 00:29:18,423
[soft laughing]

763
00:29:18,506 --> 00:29:22,051
Love Mexicano's. They're resilient
people, hard working people.

764
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:26,055
And it's fucked up they even started
a conversation about putting a wall up.

765
00:29:26,139 --> 00:29:28,683
Shit, this never worked it human history.

766
00:29:28,767 --> 00:29:31,394
And you keep repeating the same bullshit.

767
00:29:31,478 --> 00:29:33,646
First of all, it's Mexicans.

768
00:29:33,730 --> 00:29:35,857
Most creative people I know.
Huh? It's like…

769
00:29:35,940 --> 00:29:36,858
[cheering and applause]

770
00:29:36,941 --> 00:29:40,069
So creative, the Palestinians
were taking notes and shit.

771
00:29:40,695 --> 00:29:43,198
When El Chapo snuck out of
that tunnel with a motorcycle,

772
00:29:43,281 --> 00:29:45,658
we're like, [in Arabic accent]
"Hey, Abdallah, come watch, bro."

773
00:29:45,742 --> 00:29:47,160
[laughing]

774
00:29:47,243 --> 00:29:49,704
"Hey, he put
a motorcycle inside a tunnel, bro?"

775
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:50,872
"We need to do this back home."

776
00:29:50,955 --> 00:29:52,707
<i>Ya Habibi Ya Allah.</i>

777
00:29:52,791 --> 00:29:54,751
[laughing]

778
00:29:55,835 --> 00:29:58,671
You're not gonna stop Mexicans, bro.
It's not gonna work.

779
00:29:59,547 --> 00:30:02,884
Put up a wall and they'll just zipline
back into the country and shit.

780
00:30:02,967 --> 00:30:03,843
They'll be like,

781
00:30:03,927 --> 00:30:05,053
[in Spanish] "Ready, José, I'm ready."

782
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:08,556
Push me, motherfucker.
Come on, go fuck your mother.

783
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:09,474
[cheering and applause]

784
00:30:13,978 --> 00:30:15,855
[in English] They'd be like,
"Did he make it?"

785
00:30:15,939 --> 00:30:17,565
"I don't know, bro."

786
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:18,983
[laughing]

787
00:30:19,067 --> 00:30:21,486
"I think he missed the trampoline."

788
00:30:21,569 --> 00:30:22,821
[laughing]

789
00:30:22,904 --> 00:30:25,114
"Ziplining, this is so tricky."

790
00:30:25,198 --> 00:30:26,199
[laughing]

791
00:30:26,282 --> 00:30:28,284
"Timing is everything, bro."

792
00:30:28,368 --> 00:30:29,869
-[laughs]
-[laughing]

793
00:30:34,582 --> 00:30:37,085
If I was Mexican living in Mexico,

794
00:30:37,168 --> 00:30:38,920
I'd flip the whole script.

795
00:30:39,003 --> 00:30:39,963
I would.

796
00:30:40,046 --> 00:30:41,422
I'd be like, "You know what, bro?"

797
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,007
"We're building a wall, okay."

798
00:30:43,091 --> 00:30:43,925
[laughing]

799
00:30:44,008 --> 00:30:47,720
"We're building a wall. You can't come
to Cancùn no more, <i>puto</i>. How about that?"

800
00:30:47,804 --> 00:30:49,305
[laughing and cheering]

801
00:30:49,389 --> 00:30:50,390
How about that?

802
00:30:52,851 --> 00:30:53,768
That's it.

803
00:30:55,728 --> 00:30:57,438
You'd have the White girls--

804
00:30:57,522 --> 00:31:00,275
You'd have
White girls crying all across America.

805
00:31:00,358 --> 00:31:01,192
[laughing]

806
00:31:01,276 --> 00:31:03,987
They're like,
[imitating a girl] "Oh, my God."

807
00:31:04,070 --> 00:31:07,657
"I just wanted to
go to Cancùn for Spring Break."

808
00:31:07,740 --> 00:31:10,827
"Why are they so racist?
I don't understand."

809
00:31:10,910 --> 00:31:12,996
[laughing]

810
00:31:13,079 --> 00:31:15,957
"Now I have to go to Puerto Vallarta."

811
00:31:16,040 --> 00:31:17,000
[laughing]

812
00:31:17,083 --> 00:31:19,419
That's also in Mexico.
[girl voice] "Oh, my God!"

813
00:31:19,502 --> 00:31:21,671
[laughing]

814
00:31:21,754 --> 00:31:23,131
[soft laughing and applause]

815
00:31:23,214 --> 00:31:26,175
Love Mexicano's. I love doing accents.
It's a lot of fun, you know.

816
00:31:26,259 --> 00:31:27,135
When you can do them like,

817
00:31:27,218 --> 00:31:28,761
[in fake Mexican accent]
"Come on, let's hang out, it's--"

818
00:31:29,679 --> 00:31:31,180
It's fun. The German's fun.

819
00:31:31,264 --> 00:31:33,433
[in fake German accent] "Ya, ooh,
it's lovely here."

820
00:31:33,516 --> 00:31:34,392
[laughing]

821
00:31:34,475 --> 00:31:36,227
I mean, I fuck with them all day.

822
00:31:36,311 --> 00:31:37,145
Russians though,

823
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:38,771
-I don't fuck with Russians.
-[cheers and laughing]

824
00:31:38,855 --> 00:31:40,899
I don't fuck with anybody
that talk like this,

825
00:31:40,982 --> 00:31:42,358
[in fake Russian accent]
"What you say to me?"

826
00:31:42,442 --> 00:31:43,484
[laughing]

827
00:31:43,568 --> 00:31:45,778
"You fuck me, my family?
What you say to me?"

828
00:31:45,862 --> 00:31:48,573
[laughing] I'm like,
"I'm good, bra. I don't trust you."

829
00:31:48,656 --> 00:31:49,490
-[nervous laugh]
-[laughing]

830
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,659
A Russian guy
in an Adidas tracksuit. I'm good.

831
00:31:51,743 --> 00:31:53,661
[in fake Russian accent] "What
you say to me? You fuck around?"

832
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:54,787
[laughing and applause]

833
00:31:54,871 --> 00:31:56,873
"What you say?"
"I'm good, bra."

834
00:31:56,956 --> 00:31:58,124
"I'm goo…"

835
00:31:58,207 --> 00:31:59,959
I don't fuck with
anybody with a Russian accent

836
00:32:00,043 --> 00:32:02,670
and I don't fuck with anybody
with cauliflower ears.

837
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:03,755
[laughing]

838
00:32:03,838 --> 00:32:05,173
I don't fuck with them.

839
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:10,053
And if you talk like this
and you have cauliflower MMA ears,

840
00:32:10,136 --> 00:32:11,846
I don't fuck with you either, bro.

841
00:32:11,930 --> 00:32:12,764
[laughing]

842
00:32:12,847 --> 00:32:14,724
That's how I knew Khabib Nurmagomedov

843
00:32:14,807 --> 00:32:18,519
was gonna be
the greatest MMA fighter of all time.

844
00:32:18,603 --> 00:32:20,355
-[cheers and applause]
-All time.

845
00:32:20,438 --> 00:32:22,649
[applause]

846
00:32:23,483 --> 00:32:25,818
[in fake Russian accent] "He
talk like this.

847
00:32:25,902 --> 00:32:28,905
And he has the ears."
Fuck that, I'm not fucking with you, bro.

848
00:32:28,988 --> 00:32:32,575
You're a real one.
And the way he talks is terrifying.

849
00:32:32,659 --> 00:32:34,035
[Russian accent]
"Oh, you think you're real?

850
00:32:34,118 --> 00:32:35,536
You think you're from streets?"

851
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,163
"I grow up in real mountain."

852
00:32:37,246 --> 00:32:38,915
Like, "What does that mean, bro?"

853
00:32:38,998 --> 00:32:40,208
[laughing]

854
00:32:40,291 --> 00:32:42,085
"What does that mean?"

855
00:32:42,168 --> 00:32:44,379
"What do you mean you grew up there?"

856
00:32:44,462 --> 00:32:46,714
"What did you do there?" [laughs]

857
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,217
He'll say wild shit like,
"Oh, yeah, you want to fight?"

858
00:32:49,300 --> 00:32:51,260
"I'm gonna change his face."

859
00:32:51,344 --> 00:32:53,137
[laughing]

860
00:32:53,888 --> 00:32:56,891
"What is he, Potato Head, bro?
You can't do this."

861
00:32:56,975 --> 00:32:58,434
[laughing]

862
00:33:00,728 --> 00:33:05,566
You can't fuck with him. The guy-- The man
wrestled bears as an eight-year-old.

863
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:09,278
This is, you can really look this up.
He wrestled bears

864
00:33:09,362 --> 00:33:11,572
as an eight-year-old child.

865
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:14,617
The only people that would do this,
is Dagestani's.

866
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:17,537
Because there's levels to being Russian.
There's like regular Russian,

867
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,081
there's Chechnyan,
and there's Dagestani's!

868
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:23,084
It's a whole another level,
where they wrestle bears, apparently.

869
00:33:23,167 --> 00:33:26,587
And from childhood.
What the fuck are you talking about?

870
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,507
His father, God rest his soul,
were the greatest

871
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,759
coaches of all time.

872
00:33:31,843 --> 00:33:33,845
And how did that conversation even happen?

873
00:33:33,928 --> 00:33:36,264
Like he walked up to his dad like,
[in fake Russian accent] "Daddy."

874
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:37,807
[laughing]

875
00:33:37,890 --> 00:33:39,809
"Daddy, I really
want to be great champion."

876
00:33:39,892 --> 00:33:42,812
"Daddy, please, please, train me, Daddy."

877
00:33:42,895 --> 00:33:44,522
Like, "No, son, you're not ready."

878
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:47,275
"No, I'm ready. Please, please."

879
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:49,027
"Train me, Daddy." "Okay."

880
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,820
"I go get bear. Let's see."

881
00:33:50,903 --> 00:33:52,780
[laughing]

882
00:33:55,408 --> 00:33:58,202
Brought a bear into the house.
What did his mom say?

883
00:33:58,286 --> 00:33:59,829
"Hey, honey, what you doing with bear?"

884
00:33:59,912 --> 00:34:01,164
"I know, I know."

885
00:34:01,789 --> 00:34:03,708
"Relax, bear, relax."

886
00:34:03,791 --> 00:34:04,709
[laughing]

887
00:34:04,792 --> 00:34:07,420
"I bring bear. Okay." [laughs]

888
00:34:07,503 --> 00:34:10,548
"I bring bear.
Bear gonna wrestle Khabib."

889
00:34:10,631 --> 00:34:12,884
"Khabib one day will be great champion."

890
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:16,345
-"Defeat racist leprechaun in the future."
-[laughing]

891
00:34:16,429 --> 00:34:17,472
"Save Islam.

892
00:34:17,555 --> 00:34:18,723
<i>Alhamdulillah.</i> Come on."

893
00:34:18,806 --> 00:34:21,142
[cheering and whistling]

894
00:34:27,482 --> 00:34:30,485
[huffs] Don't fuck with Russians.

895
00:34:30,568 --> 00:34:32,195
Germans, I'll fuck with them all day.

896
00:34:32,278 --> 00:34:34,030
[in fake German accent] "Ooh, ya,
it's wonderful."

897
00:34:34,113 --> 00:34:34,947
[laughing]

898
00:34:35,031 --> 00:34:36,699
I did that accent at my first special

899
00:34:36,783 --> 00:34:38,993
and a lot of people messaged me like,
"Hey, man,

900
00:34:39,077 --> 00:34:41,913
you sound like
that fat caterpillar from <i>A Bug's Life</i>."

901
00:34:41,996 --> 00:34:43,581
[laughing]

902
00:34:44,665 --> 00:34:47,001
I was like, "No, I don't."
And then I watched it and I was like,

903
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:49,504
"Ah, shit, I do sound like that fat--"

904
00:34:49,587 --> 00:34:53,299
It's like, [German accent] "Ya, look
at my wings. I'm a beautiful butterfly."

905
00:34:53,382 --> 00:34:54,801
-[laughs]
-[laughing]

906
00:34:55,718 --> 00:34:56,928
[Mo] Whatever.

907
00:34:58,846 --> 00:35:00,264
[grunts]

908
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:04,477
[laughing]

909
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:07,105
It's such a blessing to be together.
Listen, let me tell you something.

910
00:35:07,188 --> 00:35:09,065
I sincerely,

911
00:35:09,148 --> 00:35:12,026
I am mad at
what they did to us. I really am.

912
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,945
The fear that they created.

913
00:35:14,028 --> 00:35:15,988
And the division they created.

914
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:18,199
It's fucking infuriating.

915
00:35:18,282 --> 00:35:21,327
"Who you voting for? Red or blue?"

916
00:35:21,410 --> 00:35:24,497
What am I, Bloods or Crips?
That's what I heard. That's all I heard.

917
00:35:24,580 --> 00:35:25,873
All you are gangsters. Okay.

918
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:28,459
Okay, all of you are gangsters.
I'm with the people.

919
00:35:28,543 --> 00:35:31,838
Always will be with the people.
That's what it is about for me.

920
00:35:31,921 --> 00:35:33,464
When the hurricane came through,

921
00:35:33,548 --> 00:35:36,008
my neighbor, Scott, redneck Scott,

922
00:35:36,092 --> 00:35:37,510
this guy is the best. Okay.

923
00:35:37,593 --> 00:35:39,846
He's always prepared.
So I'm never prepared,

924
00:35:39,929 --> 00:35:41,514
because I know he's prepared.

925
00:35:41,597 --> 00:35:42,723
[laughing]

926
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:46,894
He's always like, "Yeah. I got generators.
Hell yeah, I got generators."

927
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:50,064
"Fuck, yeah, Mohammed, I got you, baby."
You know.

928
00:35:50,148 --> 00:35:50,982
[laughing]

929
00:35:52,066 --> 00:35:54,527
When I came through he hooked me up, bro.

930
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:57,780
I plugged into the side of his house
and took that extension cord

931
00:35:57,864 --> 00:36:01,325
all the way across that cul-de-sac
and plugged my shit in.

932
00:36:01,409 --> 00:36:02,785
And that's what it's about, bro.

933
00:36:02,869 --> 00:36:04,954
They're trying to separate us,
but the fact is

934
00:36:05,037 --> 00:36:06,789
Mohammed's in Texas

935
00:36:06,873 --> 00:36:09,584
get along with redneck Scotts all day.

936
00:36:09,667 --> 00:36:11,419
[cheers and applause]

937
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:13,171
Fuck what you talking about.

938
00:36:18,926 --> 00:36:20,761
Fuck what you talking about.

939
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:22,263
That's the honest truth.

940
00:36:22,346 --> 00:36:25,141
People try to just push
this particular agenda

941
00:36:25,224 --> 00:36:26,684
and it's not, I do believe in us.

942
00:36:26,767 --> 00:36:28,686
I do. I believe in us and then

943
00:36:28,769 --> 00:36:31,731
and then I travel
and then I go to an airport

944
00:36:31,814 --> 00:36:35,401
and I realize
how fragmented we really are.

945
00:36:35,484 --> 00:36:37,612
We suck as the human race.

946
00:36:37,695 --> 00:36:39,238
We suck. [laughs]

947
00:36:39,322 --> 00:36:41,157
We're all in our own bubbles.

948
00:36:41,240 --> 00:36:43,576
Nobody's paying attention to anybody else.

949
00:36:43,659 --> 00:36:45,953
Everybody just--
You'll see this in an airport.

950
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:48,789
You'd be walking and all of a sudden
the person in front of you just stops

951
00:36:48,873 --> 00:36:50,291
and just looks up.

952
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:53,044
"What's up there?"
"I'll tell you what's behind you, bitch."

953
00:36:53,127 --> 00:36:54,795
-"Thousands of people."
-[laughing]

954
00:36:54,879 --> 00:36:56,714
"Trying to get where they want to go."

955
00:36:56,797 --> 00:36:58,299
"That's what the fuck is going on."

956
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,009
"What the hell is wrong with you?"

957
00:37:00,092 --> 00:37:02,178
"Get the fuck out of the way, all right."

958
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:03,221
[soft laughing]

959
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:04,680
If you're travelling

960
00:37:04,764 --> 00:37:08,100
with a carry-on with no wheels on it,

961
00:37:08,184 --> 00:37:10,061
-you're an asshole, okay.
-[laughing]

962
00:37:10,144 --> 00:37:14,398
You just have them all over your shoulder.
You're a fucking mess. [panting]

963
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:19,237
It's sliding off. "Oh, sorry." [panting]

964
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:22,073
Wheels exist. What's the matter with you?

965
00:37:22,156 --> 00:37:23,115
[soft laughing]

966
00:37:23,199 --> 00:37:25,451
If you have
a carry-on with only two wheels,

967
00:37:25,534 --> 00:37:28,079
this is what you look like,
"Hi." [giggles]

968
00:37:28,162 --> 00:37:32,250
Look how much
square footage you're taking behind you.

969
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,835
Why the fuck are you doing this?
"Hi." [giggles]

970
00:37:34,919 --> 00:37:38,839
-[fake laughs]
-[laughing]

971
00:37:38,923 --> 00:37:41,759
What the fuck are you doing?
Four wheels exist, man.

972
00:37:41,842 --> 00:37:43,469
This is what you look like in four wheels.

973
00:37:43,552 --> 00:37:47,807
Like a smart, intelligent human being.

974
00:37:47,890 --> 00:37:51,143
You can go forward.
You can go backwards on that <i>whore</i>.

975
00:37:51,227 --> 00:37:54,105
You can juke a motherfucker
and just keep going.

976
00:37:54,188 --> 00:37:55,273
[laughing]

977
00:37:55,356 --> 00:37:58,818
You have a baby, you put him on top of it
and you keep it cruising.

978
00:37:58,901 --> 00:38:00,027
[laughing]

979
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,990
Now if you have a four wheel carry-on
and you only use two wheels,

980
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:07,243
you're probably the biggest asshole
of them all.

981
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:08,744
[laughing]

982
00:38:08,828 --> 00:38:11,289
We can't even read numbers.

983
00:38:11,372 --> 00:38:12,999
We get to the boarding gate

984
00:38:13,082 --> 00:38:15,334
and they're like, "Boarding…"

985
00:38:15,418 --> 00:38:16,669
"Boarding group one."

986
00:38:16,752 --> 00:38:19,714
[high pitched voice] "I'm in seven,
can I go?" [giggles]

987
00:38:19,797 --> 00:38:22,133
"Well, what he--"
"I'm in eight since seven's going."

988
00:38:22,216 --> 00:38:24,844
"Get the fuck out of the way.
What are you doing?"

989
00:38:24,927 --> 00:38:26,429
[laughing]

990
00:38:28,306 --> 00:38:30,474
Then you get on the plane

991
00:38:30,558 --> 00:38:35,187
and here comes the people
with no wheels on their bags. [panting]

992
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:37,356
Just clotheslining every other person.

993
00:38:37,440 --> 00:38:41,110
-[thumping noises]
-[laughing]

994
00:38:41,193 --> 00:38:44,322
They have no clue, they just… [panting]

995
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:47,033
And here comes the assholes
with two wheels on their bags.

996
00:38:47,116 --> 00:38:49,076
-Just dragging it behind them…
-[laughing]

997
00:38:49,160 --> 00:38:51,412
…and they're getting stuck
every other seat.

998
00:38:51,495 --> 00:38:54,498
"Sorry, sorry." [fake laughs]

999
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:55,791
"Sorry." [fake laughs]

1000
00:38:55,875 --> 00:38:58,919
Turn it around, whore,
and see where you're going.

1001
00:38:59,003 --> 00:39:00,087
[laughing and applause]

1002
00:39:00,171 --> 00:39:01,839
Use your eyes.

1003
00:39:03,049 --> 00:39:04,508
Maneuver.

1004
00:39:07,178 --> 00:39:08,179
[sighs]

1005
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:11,265
Drives me insane. [laughs]

1006
00:39:12,224 --> 00:39:14,727
Flight attendants, all due respect…

1007
00:39:14,810 --> 00:39:15,895
[whoop]

1008
00:39:15,978 --> 00:39:18,230
Well, I would wait
to finish the bit, bro. [laughs]

1009
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,148
[laughing]

1010
00:39:19,231 --> 00:39:20,524
It's not good.

1011
00:39:21,192 --> 00:39:23,152
You're not saving anyone, all right.

1012
00:39:23,986 --> 00:39:26,197
You take your job
way too seriously. [laughs]

1013
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:27,198
[laughing]

1014
00:39:27,782 --> 00:39:29,658
Somebody has an issue, you just go,

1015
00:39:29,742 --> 00:39:31,994
"Is there a doctor here? Because

1016
00:39:32,078 --> 00:39:34,038
I don't know what I'm doing.
Please, somebody."

1017
00:39:34,121 --> 00:39:35,289
[laughing]

1018
00:39:38,042 --> 00:39:40,252
If you have a little bag
and it's a bulkhead,

1019
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:42,296
and you have it on the floor, oh, shit.

1020
00:39:42,380 --> 00:39:44,632
[loud breathing] "We have to put this bag

1021
00:39:44,715 --> 00:39:47,510
over here." They'll short-circuit on you.
"We have to put this

1022
00:39:47,593 --> 00:39:51,263
bag up top, okay. Just for take off.
And they will give it to you

1023
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,057
immediately after take-off, okay."

1024
00:39:53,140 --> 00:39:54,892
"Well, then, if you gonna give it to me
after take-off,

1025
00:39:54,975 --> 00:39:56,435
immediately after take-off,

1026
00:39:56,519 --> 00:39:58,437
then why the fuck
have I got to move it in the first place?"

1027
00:39:58,521 --> 00:39:59,855
"Just in case we have an

1028
00:39:59,939 --> 00:40:01,190
emergency exit situation."

1029
00:40:01,273 --> 00:40:03,067
"Wait, we're gonna exit the plane?"

1030
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:05,361
"At like 150 miles an hour?"

1031
00:40:05,444 --> 00:40:07,071
"What the fuck are you talking about?"

1032
00:40:07,154 --> 00:40:08,906
"No, no, no, we have to move the bag."

1033
00:40:09,490 --> 00:40:12,034
"According to the FA-A-A-A-A."

1034
00:40:12,118 --> 00:40:14,954
-[imitates explosion]
-[laughing]

1035
00:40:15,037 --> 00:40:16,622
Shut down.

1036
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,541
God damn shut down.

1037
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:23,963
God, the safety announcements. Oh, my God.

1038
00:40:24,046 --> 00:40:25,965
"Put on your seatbelt, everybody."

1039
00:40:26,048 --> 00:40:28,050
"Because that's
what's gonna save your life. Okay."

1040
00:40:28,134 --> 00:40:29,176
"Yes, a seatbelt

1041
00:40:29,260 --> 00:40:31,178
from 35,000 feet…

1042
00:40:31,262 --> 00:40:32,096
[laughing]

1043
00:40:32,179 --> 00:40:34,598
…to pummel into your imminent death.
Okay."

1044
00:40:34,682 --> 00:40:36,183
"On a floating rock in space."

1045
00:40:36,267 --> 00:40:38,811
"That's what's
gonna save you, is a seatbelt." No.

1046
00:40:38,894 --> 00:40:40,688
They just want your ass in the seat

1047
00:40:40,771 --> 00:40:42,398
after the plane crashes.

1048
00:40:42,481 --> 00:40:44,650
They don't want to have to hire
a third-party company

1049
00:40:44,733 --> 00:40:45,776
to look for your bitch ass.

1050
00:40:45,860 --> 00:40:47,486
-[laughing]
-That's all it is.

1051
00:40:47,570 --> 00:40:48,988
They don't.

1052
00:40:49,071 --> 00:40:50,781
They just want to
get there after the crash,

1053
00:40:50,865 --> 00:40:52,158
"Adams 3F. There he is, yup."

1054
00:40:52,241 --> 00:40:53,784
-[laughs]
-[laughing]

1055
00:40:53,868 --> 00:40:56,871
-"Well, most of him, right." [laughs]
-[laughing]

1056
00:40:56,954 --> 00:40:57,997
It's all they want.

1057
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:05,379
[huffs]

1058
00:41:06,297 --> 00:41:09,133
Because if they really thought
the seatbelt was gonna save your life,

1059
00:41:09,216 --> 00:41:11,635
they would check every single person

1060
00:41:11,719 --> 00:41:13,721
as if it's a roller coaster ride, right.

1061
00:41:13,804 --> 00:41:17,016
They'd be like,
"You're good. You're good. You're good."

1062
00:41:17,099 --> 00:41:19,393
"You goo-- Oh, you almost died, Ralph!"

1063
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,936
-[laughing]
-"You almost died."

1064
00:41:21,604 --> 00:41:22,730
They don't do that shit.

1065
00:41:22,813 --> 00:41:25,733
They just walk by.
"You're good. You're fine. Fine."

1066
00:41:25,816 --> 00:41:26,650
[laughing]

1067
00:41:28,194 --> 00:41:29,987
One flight attendant
started to argue with me,

1068
00:41:30,070 --> 00:41:32,281
"No, Mo, what if
we're having a crash landing

1069
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:33,908
and we have real bad turbulence,

1070
00:41:33,991 --> 00:41:36,035
you could fly up
and you could break your neck!"

1071
00:41:36,118 --> 00:41:38,496
I'm like, "That's what I want.
I want to break my neck."

1072
00:41:38,579 --> 00:41:40,915
"I want to be the motherfucker
like this while everybody's

1073
00:41:40,998 --> 00:41:43,375
screaming for their lives.
That's what I want."

1074
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:46,587
And while everybody's like,
"Oh, my God! Were gonna die!"

1075
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:48,631
-I'm already dead. I'm good to go.
-[laughing]

1076
00:41:48,714 --> 00:41:51,133
Just smacking motherfuckers
with no wheels on their bags.

1077
00:41:51,217 --> 00:41:54,136
-[smacking noises]
-[laughing]

1078
00:41:54,887 --> 00:41:55,930
That's what I want.

1079
00:41:56,013 --> 00:41:57,973
[soft laughing]

1080
00:41:59,350 --> 00:42:00,226
[huffs]

1081
00:42:01,602 --> 00:42:03,270
Yes, I remember,

1082
00:42:03,354 --> 00:42:05,439
if we lose cabin pressure,

1083
00:42:05,523 --> 00:42:07,775
me first, fuck the baby.

1084
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:09,360
[laughing]

1085
00:42:10,694 --> 00:42:14,198
The little oxygen thing comes down.
Me first, fuck the baby.

1086
00:42:14,281 --> 00:42:16,116
Not my rule. Your rule.

1087
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,284
[laughing]

1088
00:42:18,035 --> 00:42:21,247
Flew in from New York to Houston. Okay.

1089
00:42:21,330 --> 00:42:24,833
I live here, but we flew in
from New York to Houston

1090
00:42:24,917 --> 00:42:27,753
and there's not
a single body of water in sight.

1091
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:31,090
But we have to worry about
this flotation device, everybody.

1092
00:42:31,173 --> 00:42:33,008
You put the thing on over and you

1093
00:42:33,092 --> 00:42:34,218
buckle up the front.

1094
00:42:34,301 --> 00:42:36,971
And then you pull the string…
[swoosh noise] like that.

1095
00:42:37,054 --> 00:42:38,347
And it will inflate.

1096
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:41,350
But if it doesn't inflate, don't panic!

1097
00:42:41,433 --> 00:42:43,561
There's a straw right here.

1098
00:42:43,644 --> 00:42:44,478
[laughing]

1099
00:42:44,562 --> 00:42:47,523
That only, apparently,
requires one breath.

1100
00:42:47,606 --> 00:42:49,149
One magical breath.

1101
00:42:49,233 --> 00:42:51,777
They make this shit look so easy.
Just… [blows]

1102
00:42:51,860 --> 00:42:54,029
"You're fine everybody, you're fine."

1103
00:42:54,113 --> 00:42:56,282
Bitch, have you ever tried to inflate

1104
00:42:56,365 --> 00:42:58,784
anything manually in your whole life?

1105
00:42:58,867 --> 00:43:00,119
[laughing]

1106
00:43:00,202 --> 00:43:02,121
I did my nephew's pool party.

1107
00:43:02,204 --> 00:43:04,540
I damn near died doing his floaties.

1108
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:06,208
[laughing]

1109
00:43:06,292 --> 00:43:08,711
You're telling me in the middle
of a crash landing, we'll be like…

1110
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:13,299
-[screams and blows]
-[laughing]

1111
00:43:13,382 --> 00:43:14,216
Dead.

1112
00:43:14,300 --> 00:43:15,676
[laughing]

1113
00:43:15,759 --> 00:43:18,804
Don't worry, there's a second
and third layer of protection, okay.

1114
00:43:18,887 --> 00:43:21,015
There's a little flickering light, okay.

1115
00:43:21,098 --> 00:43:23,392
It's not even a light.
It's a reflective light

1116
00:43:23,475 --> 00:43:25,644
the size of a dime, I shit you not.

1117
00:43:25,728 --> 00:43:28,564
The size of a dime and a whistle. Okay.

1118
00:43:28,647 --> 00:43:33,027
In the vast, echo-y,
reflective oceans of the Earth,

1119
00:43:33,110 --> 00:43:35,321
this is how we're gonna find
your bitch ass… [mock whistle noise]

1120
00:43:35,404 --> 00:43:36,780
"I'm right here." [mock laughs]

1121
00:43:36,864 --> 00:43:38,949
[whistle noise] "I'm right here."
[mock laugh]

1122
00:43:39,033 --> 00:43:41,535
[whistle noise]
"You haven't found the Malaysia plane."

1123
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:44,580
-[laughing]
-"An entire jumbo jet, bitch."

1124
00:43:44,663 --> 00:43:47,166
[cheers and applause]

1125
00:43:50,669 --> 00:43:53,005
You're gonna find
my bitch ass, just floating around…

1126
00:43:53,088 --> 00:43:54,757
[whistle noise] "I'm right here."

1127
00:43:54,840 --> 00:43:56,300
[whistle noise] "I'm right here."

1128
00:43:56,383 --> 00:44:00,304
You just told all
the ocean's predators your exact location.

1129
00:44:00,387 --> 00:44:03,223
You're dead. <i>BeTizik</i>
is what I'm saying.

1130
00:44:09,313 --> 00:44:11,357
-[grunts]
-[laughing and applause]

1131
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:15,736
[grunting and laughs]

1132
00:44:15,819 --> 00:44:17,988
-[laughs]
-[laughing]

1133
00:44:18,072 --> 00:44:18,947
Fuck!

1134
00:44:19,031 --> 00:44:20,324
[laughing]

1135
00:44:21,116 --> 00:44:25,162
For the first time, for the first time
I ever felt this way in my life.

1136
00:44:25,245 --> 00:44:28,666
I'm a refugee that came to America,
I'm an American citizen, of course, now.

1137
00:44:28,749 --> 00:44:30,376
But, you know, for the first time

1138
00:44:30,459 --> 00:44:33,587
everybody that was making fun
of Texas in California,

1139
00:44:33,671 --> 00:44:35,506
right in the middle of the pandemic,

1140
00:44:35,589 --> 00:44:37,925
"Oh, we need to go to Texas." Yeah?

1141
00:44:38,008 --> 00:44:40,344
"You need to come here?"
For the first time I felt this way,

1142
00:44:40,427 --> 00:44:42,638
"Go back to where
you came from, son of a bitch."

1143
00:44:42,721 --> 00:44:43,555
[laughing]

1144
00:44:43,639 --> 00:44:45,766
-"You're fucking up our real estate."
-[cheers and applause]

1145
00:44:45,849 --> 00:44:48,352
"Go back home." That's how I feel.

1146
00:44:48,435 --> 00:44:50,020
That's how…

1147
00:44:50,104 --> 00:44:52,773
I was like, "I get why they do it.
It felt good, a little bit. It felt good."

1148
00:44:52,856 --> 00:44:53,691
[soft laughing]

1149
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:56,151
I am an Arab-American. That's what I am.

1150
00:44:56,235 --> 00:44:58,862
Didn't do it. Yup.

1151
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:00,114
[cheering and applause]

1152
00:45:00,864 --> 00:45:02,658
Palestinian-Arab-Amer-- This is…

1153
00:45:02,741 --> 00:45:04,576
-[cheering and whistling]
-Listen.

1154
00:45:04,660 --> 00:45:05,953
Thank you.

1155
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:09,540
All right, let's start that party.
Let's do it.

1156
00:45:10,541 --> 00:45:13,627
Here's the thing.
I'm not doing that for applause.

1157
00:45:13,710 --> 00:45:17,172
I did that just to tell you
that's how you identify yourself.

1158
00:45:17,256 --> 00:45:20,801
I am an Arab-American.
That's how it works here in America.

1159
00:45:20,884 --> 00:45:23,095
If you're not White,

1160
00:45:23,178 --> 00:45:25,347
you have something before American.

1161
00:45:25,431 --> 00:45:27,015
[laughing]

1162
00:45:27,099 --> 00:45:30,436
Unless when I'm buying a gun.
That's the only time.

1163
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:33,147
When you're buying a gun in Texas,
the first question is,

1164
00:45:33,230 --> 00:45:35,274
"Are you hispanic?"

1165
00:45:35,357 --> 00:45:37,985
Super racist. "No." [laughs]

1166
00:45:38,068 --> 00:45:40,654
Next, "Are you African-Americ--"
"No." [laughs]

1167
00:45:40,737 --> 00:45:42,656
And then there, has no Arab-American.

1168
00:45:42,739 --> 00:45:45,576
I was like, you know what, fuck it,
"I'm White as fuck today."

1169
00:45:45,659 --> 00:45:48,662
"Give me that
double barrel, 12 gauge shot gun, baby."

1170
00:45:48,745 --> 00:45:50,330
[laughing]

1171
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:53,459
But all the other times,

1172
00:45:53,542 --> 00:45:56,295
all the other times, I'm Arab-American.

1173
00:45:56,378 --> 00:45:59,548
You're not White in America,
you have something before American.

1174
00:45:59,631 --> 00:46:01,091
That's how it works out.

1175
00:46:01,175 --> 00:46:03,302
That's just the way it is. [laughs] Okay.

1176
00:46:03,385 --> 00:46:05,429
Unless you're White. You're just White.

1177
00:46:05,512 --> 00:46:07,764
Everybody else,
something right before American.

1178
00:46:07,848 --> 00:46:09,600
Even Natives. Natives are natives.

1179
00:46:09,683 --> 00:46:12,519
-Native Americans. We got to identify…
-[laughing]

1180
00:46:12,603 --> 00:46:14,563
…the Native Americans.

1181
00:46:15,689 --> 00:46:18,317
African Americans. Most of my
Black friends have never been to Africa.

1182
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:21,028
Nonetheless,
they're African Americans anyway.

1183
00:46:21,945 --> 00:46:25,073
Mexican-Americans, Asian-Americans,
and so forth and so on.

1184
00:46:25,741 --> 00:46:26,658
Unless you're White.

1185
00:46:26,742 --> 00:46:29,786
If you're White, you just sprouted
from the corn fields of Ohio.

1186
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:30,704
[laughing]

1187
00:46:30,787 --> 00:46:32,789
And you just
spread across this great land.

1188
00:46:32,873 --> 00:46:34,500
Unless it's Saint Paddy's day,
then you're like,

1189
00:46:34,583 --> 00:46:37,503
"Oh, shit, my great-granddaddy
was a quarter Irish."

1190
00:46:37,586 --> 00:46:38,795
[laughing and applause]

1191
00:46:46,303 --> 00:46:47,429
[huffs]

1192
00:46:47,513 --> 00:46:50,516
That's what I am though,
an Arab-American. And I got to say,

1193
00:46:50,599 --> 00:46:52,476
as an Arab-American,

1194
00:46:52,559 --> 00:46:55,771
I find it really fascinating
to see our culture

1195
00:46:55,854 --> 00:46:57,272
spreading throughout the West.

1196
00:46:57,356 --> 00:46:59,608
Really fascinating. It is.

1197
00:46:59,691 --> 00:47:00,526
[cheering and applause]

1198
00:47:00,609 --> 00:47:02,819
It's pretty damn cool.

1199
00:47:02,903 --> 00:47:04,571
Like, if you don't know what a hookah is,

1200
00:47:04,655 --> 00:47:06,657
you're like culturally ignorant.

1201
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:08,200
And if you don't know what a hookah is…

1202
00:47:08,283 --> 00:47:11,620
"You don't know what a hookah is, Denise?
Where have you been?" [giggles]

1203
00:47:11,703 --> 00:47:15,749
"It's like this bong,
but it's not. It's like

1204
00:47:15,832 --> 00:47:18,252
so ornate and it has

1205
00:47:18,335 --> 00:47:21,213
all these different tobaccos flavors.
And then

1206
00:47:21,296 --> 00:47:24,258
there's this pipe that comes out.
And you just prrr."

1207
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:27,636
"Blow it out, it's so--
We can get two pipes

1208
00:47:27,719 --> 00:47:30,764
and we can brrr together, Denise.
Oh, my God." [laughs]

1209
00:47:30,847 --> 00:47:32,891
And then White people saw this,
which is amazing.

1210
00:47:32,975 --> 00:47:35,561
You got to give it up.
They distilled it into a battery and put

1211
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:38,230
a cartridge on top of it

1212
00:47:38,313 --> 00:47:41,525
with some mysterious liquid
that nobody's questioning.

1213
00:47:41,608 --> 00:47:42,442
[laughing]

1214
00:47:42,526 --> 00:47:44,778
Everybody just walk around like… [snorts]

1215
00:47:45,362 --> 00:47:50,701
-[growly exhale]
-[laughing]

1216
00:47:50,784 --> 00:47:52,077
"It's perfectly healthy."

1217
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,581
"Bro, I've never seen
that much smoke come out of a hookah."

1218
00:47:55,664 --> 00:47:56,915
[laughing]

1219
00:47:56,999 --> 00:47:58,458
"Much less this little device."

1220
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:01,461
"You're changing weather climates
on a regular basis."

1221
00:48:01,545 --> 00:48:03,171
"What the fuck is going on?"

1222
00:48:03,255 --> 00:48:04,756
"No, it's healthy." [mock laughs]

1223
00:48:04,840 --> 00:48:07,217
[snorts and growly exhale]

1224
00:48:07,301 --> 00:48:10,345
"It can't be, bro.
It's a metal with some battery

1225
00:48:10,429 --> 00:48:12,431
hooked up to some metal.
I'm sure you're fucked."

1226
00:48:12,514 --> 00:48:13,682
"Please stop doing this."

1227
00:48:13,765 --> 00:48:14,766
[laughing]

1228
00:48:14,850 --> 00:48:17,019
That's the first
public service announcement.

1229
00:48:17,102 --> 00:48:18,103
[soft laughing]

1230
00:48:18,186 --> 00:48:20,814
The second public service announcement,

1231
00:48:22,024 --> 00:48:25,110
something that Redd Foxx
actually tried to spread in America

1232
00:48:25,193 --> 00:48:27,070
in the early 70's.

1233
00:48:27,154 --> 00:48:31,325
And I would say that most Muslims
living in the West

1234
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,452
are all wondering why…

1235
00:48:34,620 --> 00:48:36,955
nobody wash their ass.
I'm just gonna say it. [laughs]

1236
00:48:37,039 --> 00:48:39,291
-[laughing]
-[cheers and applause]

1237
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,543
It's really weird.

1238
00:48:42,252 --> 00:48:43,795
Please wash your ass. [laughs]

1239
00:48:43,879 --> 00:48:48,133
It's really weird that bidets are
like not the norm, you know what I mean?

1240
00:48:48,216 --> 00:48:51,595
Why is toilet paper
the first and only option?

1241
00:48:51,678 --> 00:48:54,973
It's like, that's it.
It's like leaves, toilet paper,

1242
00:48:55,057 --> 00:48:56,308
baby wipes, and water.

1243
00:48:56,391 --> 00:48:58,060
Why? Why would you do this?

1244
00:48:58,143 --> 00:49:00,312
It's obvio-- Everybody's eating ass.

1245
00:49:00,395 --> 00:49:03,065
Nobody's washing their ass. It's crazy.

1246
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:04,816
[loud laughing]

1247
00:49:05,984 --> 00:49:06,985
It's crazy.

1248
00:49:08,945 --> 00:49:10,781
If you got shit on you, you're like,

1249
00:49:10,864 --> 00:49:14,201
"Oh, my God, I got shit."
You would wash it off right away.

1250
00:49:14,284 --> 00:49:15,786
You're like, "Oh, I'm okay now."

1251
00:49:15,869 --> 00:49:17,579
"I got the shit off of me."

1252
00:49:17,663 --> 00:49:20,415
But when you go, you're like, "I'm fine."
And you just walk…

1253
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:21,958
[laughing]

1254
00:49:26,088 --> 00:49:27,089
[huffs]

1255
00:49:28,465 --> 00:49:31,176
My cousin came to visit me from back home.

1256
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:34,137
And he was like,
"Hey, I want to try five-star hotel."

1257
00:49:34,221 --> 00:49:37,099
I'm like, "Bro, of course.
Enjoy yourself."

1258
00:49:37,182 --> 00:49:40,352
And he does it. And I said,
"Hey, man, I'll pick you up

1259
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:43,397
at noon at the mall. Next day."
He was like, "Okay."

1260
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,732
And I picked him up the next day

1261
00:49:45,816 --> 00:49:48,151
and I see him,
he had this really upset look on his face.

1262
00:49:48,235 --> 00:49:49,695
I'm like, "What's going on, bro?"

1263
00:49:49,778 --> 00:49:51,238
He was like this.
I'm like, "What's going on, bro?"

1264
00:49:51,321 --> 00:49:53,281
He was like, <i>"Allah Yoqrifhem"</i>.

1265
00:49:53,365 --> 00:49:56,326
<i>"Allah Yoqrifhem"</i>.

1266
00:49:56,410 --> 00:49:57,786
I was like,
"Bro, you can't be yelling Allah

1267
00:49:57,869 --> 00:49:59,037
in the middle of
the Galleria Mall like this."

1268
00:49:59,121 --> 00:50:01,039
-[laughing]
-"What are you doing?"

1269
00:50:01,123 --> 00:50:02,582
"Relax."

1270
00:50:03,917 --> 00:50:06,795
"What's the problem?"
He goes, "They don't have a bidet."

1271
00:50:06,878 --> 00:50:10,340
"They don't have a bidet.
Five star hotel!"

1272
00:50:10,424 --> 00:50:12,551
"Not one star, two star,
three star, four star,

1273
00:50:12,634 --> 00:50:14,678
five star hotel! No bidet."

1274
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:17,973
"Every time I go to the bathroom,
I have to take a shower."

1275
00:50:18,056 --> 00:50:19,224
[laughing]

1276
00:50:19,307 --> 00:50:21,977
"I've taken five showers today, Mo."

1277
00:50:22,060 --> 00:50:23,270
[laughing]

1278
00:50:25,355 --> 00:50:28,108
"I'm more worried about
your digestional tract, bro."

1279
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:29,025
[laughing]

1280
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:31,319
"Five shits before noon.
What are you doing?"

1281
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,279
[laughing]

1282
00:50:32,362 --> 00:50:34,406
"Stop eating at IHOP, okay."

1283
00:50:34,489 --> 00:50:36,366
[laughing]

1284
00:50:38,076 --> 00:50:39,369
My friend Nick came over.

1285
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:42,289
I upgraded all my toilets
after my first Netflix special.

1286
00:50:42,372 --> 00:50:44,082
Those Japanese toilets.

1287
00:50:44,166 --> 00:50:46,501
And my friend Nick
walks into the bathroom.

1288
00:50:46,585 --> 00:50:48,378
He walks right back out.
He's like, "Hey, Mo,

1289
00:50:48,462 --> 00:50:51,965
why does, uh, your toilet have a remote?"

1290
00:50:52,048 --> 00:50:53,800
[laughing]

1291
00:50:53,884 --> 00:50:57,012
I was like, "Oh, because it has
a built-in bidet and blow dryer."

1292
00:50:57,095 --> 00:50:58,263
He was like, "What's a bidet?"

1293
00:50:58,346 --> 00:51:00,599
I was like, "You don't know
what a bidet is?" He was like, "No."

1294
00:51:00,682 --> 00:51:02,476
I was like, "Oh, my God, I failed you."

1295
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:04,102
-[laughing]
-I was like…

1296
00:51:04,186 --> 00:51:05,520
I was like, "A bidet is

1297
00:51:05,604 --> 00:51:06,938
once you go boo-boo,

1298
00:51:07,022 --> 00:51:11,151
it sprays water up your-- around your ass
and washes your ass."

1299
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:12,944
His response to me was, "Ew."

1300
00:51:13,028 --> 00:51:14,237
I was like, "Ew?"

1301
00:51:14,321 --> 00:51:17,699
I'm like, "Nick, you're the 'ew'
in this equation, bro."

1302
00:51:18,408 --> 00:51:19,826
Get in there and wash your ass.

1303
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:20,744
[laughing and applause]

1304
00:51:22,078 --> 00:51:24,122
[cheering and applause]

1305
00:51:26,416 --> 00:51:28,835
He was in there for like 20 minutes, man.

1306
00:51:28,919 --> 00:51:30,462
He came out like he was baptized.
He was like…

1307
00:51:30,545 --> 00:51:34,132
He was like… [sing-song] Ah-ah-ah!

1308
00:51:34,216 --> 00:51:35,675
[laughing and applause]

1309
00:51:36,635 --> 00:51:40,388
He had a stride in his step.
A new confidence I've never seen before.

1310
00:51:40,472 --> 00:51:41,389
[laughing]

1311
00:51:41,473 --> 00:51:43,433
Second public service announcement.

1312
00:51:44,100 --> 00:51:45,602
The third one

1313
00:51:45,685 --> 00:51:47,312
starts off with a question.

1314
00:51:47,395 --> 00:51:50,315
Imagine it's World War II era. Okay.

1315
00:51:50,398 --> 00:51:53,735
Very important. Imagine it's
World War II era in America.

1316
00:51:53,819 --> 00:51:55,737
And I'm walking around
the States like, "Hey,

1317
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:58,031
would you like to try some of this sushi?"

1318
00:51:58,114 --> 00:52:00,659
They'd be like, "Oh, what's sushi?"
You'd be like,

1319
00:52:00,742 --> 00:52:02,661
"Sushi is a Japanese dish."

1320
00:52:02,744 --> 00:52:05,163
They'd be like, "Japanese!"

1321
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:07,874
"Get this damn Jap-food out of my face!"

1322
00:52:07,958 --> 00:52:08,834
[soft laughing]

1323
00:52:08,917 --> 00:52:10,460
Probably what they would say.

1324
00:52:10,544 --> 00:52:11,920
[soft laughing]

1325
00:52:12,003 --> 00:52:15,382
Now imagine it's September 12th,

1326
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:17,342
2001,

1327
00:52:17,425 --> 00:52:19,469
and I'm walking around
the States like, "Hey,

1328
00:52:19,553 --> 00:52:21,513
would you like to try
some of this hummus?"

1329
00:52:21,596 --> 00:52:23,348
They'd be like, "Oh, what's hummus?"

1330
00:52:23,431 --> 00:52:25,851
I'm like, "Oh,
hummus is a very Arab dish."

1331
00:52:25,934 --> 00:52:27,394
They'd be like, "Arab!" [bash noise]

1332
00:52:27,477 --> 00:52:31,273
"Get this damn
sand-nigga-al-Qaida-food out of my face!"

1333
00:52:31,356 --> 00:52:32,732
[laughing]

1334
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:34,484
It's probably what they would say.

1335
00:52:34,568 --> 00:52:35,527
[soft laughing]

1336
00:52:35,610 --> 00:52:38,071
Here's a very important clarification,

1337
00:52:38,154 --> 00:52:42,117
the way you say it is "hummus".
It's an "h". It's a "ha". Okay.

1338
00:52:42,200 --> 00:52:44,494
Jews, it's not
[Jewish accent] hummus. Okay.

1339
00:52:44,578 --> 00:52:47,289
[Jewish accent] It's not hummus.
It's not hummus.

1340
00:52:47,372 --> 00:52:50,584
"Ghe" is a different letter
in our alphabet. Okay.

1341
00:52:50,667 --> 00:52:53,378
In our lang--
"Ghe" is a completely different letter.

1342
00:52:53,461 --> 00:52:57,007
You don't have the "ghe" in your language.
So obviously it's not yours.

1343
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:00,176
Back the fuck up. It's our hummus.

1344
00:53:00,260 --> 00:53:01,511
[cheering and applause]

1345
00:53:01,595 --> 00:53:02,721
Back up.

1346
00:53:05,515 --> 00:53:06,933
It's what it is. All right.

1347
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,476
And now hummus is everywhere.

1348
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:09,853
"Oh, I want some hummus."

1349
00:53:09,936 --> 00:53:12,022
Hummus, some shitty hummus everywhere.

1350
00:53:12,105 --> 00:53:13,732
Fucking coffee shops have hummus.

1351
00:53:13,815 --> 00:53:15,400
Seven Elevens have hummus.

1352
00:53:15,483 --> 00:53:18,403
Every gas station, hummus, hummus, hummus.

1353
00:53:18,486 --> 00:53:20,780
I was on a flight
and the flight attendant comes up,

1354
00:53:20,864 --> 00:53:22,616
"Would you like
to have a little light snack?"

1355
00:53:22,699 --> 00:53:24,117
I looked at it. I was like,
"What the fuck is this?"

1356
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:25,201
She's like, "This is hummus."

1357
00:53:25,285 --> 00:53:28,747
I was like, "No, it's not."
This is a little juice box situation.

1358
00:53:28,830 --> 00:53:31,791
You rip off a little corner and you get
a little potato chip like this.

1359
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:32,918
And you squeeze it out.

1360
00:53:33,001 --> 00:53:35,629
Just metaphorically shitting
on my entire lineage.

1361
00:53:35,712 --> 00:53:37,797
-"Fuck your history." That's how it feels.
-[laughing and applause]

1362
00:53:37,881 --> 00:53:39,007
That's how it feels.

1363
00:53:39,090 --> 00:53:41,593
"Fuck your grandmother with every shit

1364
00:53:41,676 --> 00:53:43,845
of hummus
that comes out of this thing. Ugh."

1365
00:53:43,929 --> 00:53:45,055
It's not hummus.

1366
00:53:45,138 --> 00:53:46,306
[soft laughing]

1367
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:48,934
I went to Trader Joe's
and they have those samples like,

1368
00:53:49,017 --> 00:53:51,686
"Hey, would you like to try
a some of this chocolate hummus?

1369
00:53:51,770 --> 00:53:54,856
I was like, "What the fuck?
It's chocolate hummus."

1370
00:53:54,940 --> 00:53:56,399
[laughing]

1371
00:53:57,108 --> 00:54:00,028
And then I just fainted
like building seven. I just fainted.

1372
00:54:00,111 --> 00:54:01,988
[soft laughing]

1373
00:54:05,450 --> 00:54:07,077
We got to talk about it at some point.

1374
00:54:07,160 --> 00:54:08,703
[laughing]

1375
00:54:08,787 --> 00:54:10,580
Went to this South African

1376
00:54:10,664 --> 00:54:14,292
fine dining South African restaurant when
we were filming the movie in Atlanta.

1377
00:54:14,376 --> 00:54:15,877
And the waiter comes over and he's like,

1378
00:54:15,961 --> 00:54:19,339
"Say, bra, we have some
red bean hummus here."

1379
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:21,049
I was like,
"What the fuck did you just say?"

1380
00:54:21,132 --> 00:54:23,718
He goes, "We have some
red bean hummus here."

1381
00:54:23,802 --> 00:54:26,221
I was like,
"Bro, are there chickpeas in this?"

1382
00:54:26,304 --> 00:54:29,474
He goes, "Nah, bra, it's red bean hummus."

1383
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:32,435
I was like,
"Bitch, hummus means chickpeas!"

1384
00:54:32,519 --> 00:54:33,603
[laughing]

1385
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,897
This is refried beans, dog.

1386
00:54:35,981 --> 00:54:37,023
[laughing and applause]

1387
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:41,069
<i>Frijoles refritos</i> homie.

1388
00:54:42,988 --> 00:54:45,907
"You're pawning off Mexican food now?"

1389
00:54:45,991 --> 00:54:48,743
"As hummus? Get this shit out of my face!"

1390
00:54:49,786 --> 00:54:51,496
Hummus is very simple.

1391
00:54:51,579 --> 00:54:54,666
It's four ingredients,
sometimes five. That's all it is.

1392
00:54:54,749 --> 00:54:56,459
You get your chickpeas, tahini paste,

1393
00:54:56,543 --> 00:54:59,337
lemon juice, salt, sometimes garlic. Okay.

1394
00:54:59,421 --> 00:55:01,965
You get your food processor out.

1395
00:55:02,048 --> 00:55:03,258
It's like a little science experiment.

1396
00:55:03,341 --> 00:55:05,969
Put it all in there, you're like…
[blending noise]

1397
00:55:06,052 --> 00:55:08,054
"No, no, no. More tahini paste."
[blending noise]

1398
00:55:09,931 --> 00:55:11,433
"No, no, no. More lemon juice."
[blending noise]

1399
00:55:12,851 --> 00:55:16,563
You're like, "Fuck, it's all lemon juice."
More chickpeas. More tahini paste.

1400
00:55:18,064 --> 00:55:19,816
"Fuck, it's all tahini paste again."

1401
00:55:19,899 --> 00:55:21,776
"More lemon juice." [blending noise]

1402
00:55:21,860 --> 00:55:23,528
Like, "Fuck, it's all lemon juice.
Needs salt."

1403
00:55:23,611 --> 00:55:26,322
"Chickpeas and tahini paste."
[blending noise]

1404
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:27,782
You're like, "Fuck, more tahini paste."

1405
00:55:28,867 --> 00:55:30,660
You're like, "Oh, that's perfect."

1406
00:55:32,996 --> 00:55:34,831
[cheering and applause]

1407
00:55:39,210 --> 00:55:41,963
Now you have 20 pounds
of hummus right here.

1408
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:43,506
[laughing]

1409
00:55:43,590 --> 00:55:44,591
[huffs]

1410
00:55:45,592 --> 00:55:46,634
[laughing]

1411
00:55:47,135 --> 00:55:48,762
This is very important.

1412
00:55:48,845 --> 00:55:50,930
You scoop out the hummus
and you put it in a bowl.

1413
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,016
Okay. You put the hummus in a bowl!

1414
00:55:53,099 --> 00:55:54,934
You don't put it on a flat plate.

1415
00:55:55,018 --> 00:55:56,519
Nobody know how to dip

1416
00:55:56,603 --> 00:55:58,229
on a flat plate, bro.

1417
00:55:58,313 --> 00:56:01,274
-You got like race track marks everywhere.
-[laughing]

1418
00:56:01,357 --> 00:56:03,651
You got hummus coming over the sides.

1419
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:05,487
Complete chaos.

1420
00:56:05,570 --> 00:56:08,907
You need a bowl to help you
with the scoop situation. Okay.

1421
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:10,366
Now we're not done yet.

1422
00:56:10,450 --> 00:56:11,451
You got that bowl of hummus and

1423
00:56:11,534 --> 00:56:12,744
you make a little crater right
in the middle.

1424
00:56:12,827 --> 00:56:16,039
Grab some fresh chickpeas, you put it
right in the middle for texture. Okay.

1425
00:56:16,122 --> 00:56:19,084
And then you grab some olive oil.
Not that clear yellow shit.

1426
00:56:19,167 --> 00:56:20,877
Some deep green olive oil.

1427
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:22,170
"Oh, what do I do with that?"

1428
00:56:22,253 --> 00:56:24,714
"Do I just drizzle,
a little drizzle of garnish?"

1429
00:56:24,798 --> 00:56:26,966
-"No, whore. You turn it over…
-[laughing]

1430
00:56:27,050 --> 00:56:28,760
…and you hold it. Okay."

1431
00:56:28,843 --> 00:56:31,471
"One Mississippi, two, three, four."

1432
00:56:31,554 --> 00:56:34,474
"If you think it's too much,
it's not enough. Keep it going."

1433
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:36,017
[laughing]

1434
00:56:36,851 --> 00:56:37,852
Okay.

1435
00:56:39,646 --> 00:56:41,773
I like to finish it off
with a little lemon juice.

1436
00:56:41,856 --> 00:56:43,733
And some diced up jalapenos.

1437
00:56:43,817 --> 00:56:45,443
And I put them on each corner like that.

1438
00:56:45,527 --> 00:56:46,820
Now if I serve you

1439
00:56:46,903 --> 00:56:49,697
this extremely authentic
Palestinian hummus

1440
00:56:49,781 --> 00:56:51,241
and you grab a carrot,

1441
00:56:51,324 --> 00:56:53,243
I'm gonna fuck you up, okay.

1442
00:56:53,326 --> 00:56:54,160
[laughing]

1443
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:57,413
"I just want to try it
and I'm watching my carbs."

1444
00:56:57,497 --> 00:56:59,749
"It's not for you, ho. Back the fuck up!"

1445
00:56:59,833 --> 00:57:00,667
[laughing]

1446
00:57:00,750 --> 00:57:02,669
You need some fresh hot,

1447
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:04,796
fresh hot steamy pita bread.

1448
00:57:04,879 --> 00:57:06,631
You rip off a little corner like this.

1449
00:57:06,714 --> 00:57:09,676
And you put it together.
And it just binds because it's so steamy.

1450
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:11,052
You make a perfect cone

1451
00:57:11,136 --> 00:57:13,096
and when you dip, you dip like this…

1452
00:57:13,179 --> 00:57:15,140
You dip towards yourself.

1453
00:57:15,223 --> 00:57:16,516
You don't dip out!

1454
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:19,686
You're like, "Oh, I wanna taste like
what it's like on that side."

1455
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:23,064
"Bitch, it's the same hummus
on each side. Okay."

1456
00:57:23,148 --> 00:57:24,065
[laughing and applause]

1457
00:57:24,149 --> 00:57:27,777
"Nobody wants your stinky ass fingers
in their hummus, all right."

1458
00:57:27,861 --> 00:57:29,612
"Oh, but I wanna taste
what's on that side."

1459
00:57:29,696 --> 00:57:32,991
"You know what, I'm gonna put a wall
right in the middle of the hummus."

1460
00:57:33,074 --> 00:57:34,117
[cheering and applause]

1461
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,952
"Put a wall right here."

1462
00:57:37,412 --> 00:57:39,456
All right. That side is hummus.

1463
00:57:39,539 --> 00:57:40,999
This side is hummus.

1464
00:57:41,082 --> 00:57:43,543
I was looking for a one-bowl solution,

1465
00:57:43,626 --> 00:57:45,170
but you won't share, so

1466
00:57:45,253 --> 00:57:46,671
<i>BeTizik</i> is what I'm saying.

1467
00:57:46,754 --> 00:57:47,755
[cheering and applause]

1468
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,258
Thank you so much, Houston. I love you.

1469
00:57:50,341 --> 00:57:51,676
Thank you so much.

1470
00:57:51,759 --> 00:57:54,679
[cheering and applause]

1471
00:57:57,599 --> 00:57:59,684
[Mo] Man, I love you all.
Take a seat, take a seat.

1472
00:58:00,768 --> 00:58:02,729
What a beautiful thing.
What a beautiful gathering.

1473
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:05,607
I take all of this very, very seriously.

1474
00:58:06,941 --> 00:58:08,651
I'm gonna tell you why

1475
00:58:08,735 --> 00:58:10,278
it's all so important to me.

1476
00:58:10,361 --> 00:58:12,780
It took me 20 years to get my citizenship.

1477
00:58:12,864 --> 00:58:14,741
It's talked about in my first special.

1478
00:58:14,824 --> 00:58:16,284
I am Palestinian

1479
00:58:16,367 --> 00:58:20,413
and it was the first time I was able to
actually go back to Palestine.

1480
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,499
-[whoops and cheers]
-Because you're not allowed,

1481
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:26,836
you're not allowed to go back, even though

1482
00:58:26,920 --> 00:58:29,130
my mother's born there,
my great-grandmother's born there,

1483
00:58:29,214 --> 00:58:31,508
my grandmother, my great-grandmother…

1484
00:58:31,591 --> 00:58:34,511
We have a thousand years of history there.

1485
00:58:34,594 --> 00:58:35,845
Still cannot go there

1486
00:58:35,929 --> 00:58:38,765
until you get your US passport.
And it's still an obstacle

1487
00:58:38,848 --> 00:58:40,517
when you get there, you know.

1488
00:58:40,600 --> 00:58:42,227
When you first get there, like,

1489
00:58:42,310 --> 00:58:43,603
"Where you from?"

1490
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,021
"Bitch, where are you from?"

1491
00:58:45,104 --> 00:58:46,397
[laughing]

1492
00:58:46,481 --> 00:58:48,399
And she said, "Uzbekistan."

1493
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,027
It's tough.

1494
00:58:53,154 --> 00:58:54,489
It's a difficult thing.

1495
00:58:54,572 --> 00:58:56,658
You always think about going home.

1496
00:58:56,741 --> 00:58:59,035
Your mom talks about it. You see

1497
00:58:59,118 --> 00:59:01,496
my family back home.
And you want to go see it.

1498
00:59:01,579 --> 00:59:02,789
Don't get me wrong,

1499
00:59:02,872 --> 00:59:06,084
I'm saying "back home",
this is my home too.

1500
00:59:06,167 --> 00:59:07,293
This is my house.

1501
00:59:07,377 --> 00:59:10,129
-My father is buried here.
-[cheers and applause]

1502
00:59:10,213 --> 00:59:11,631
You understand?

1503
00:59:11,714 --> 00:59:13,341
[applause]

1504
00:59:16,511 --> 00:59:19,264
[Mo sighs] So we went,

1505
00:59:19,347 --> 00:59:21,891
for the first time I went to Burin,

1506
00:59:21,975 --> 00:59:24,686
a little village short of Nablus,

1507
00:59:24,769 --> 00:59:25,979
where my family is from.

1508
00:59:26,813 --> 00:59:29,148
It was beautiful. I got to see my aunts.

1509
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:30,942
Amazing, cooking up feasts.

1510
00:59:31,025 --> 00:59:33,778
This didn't get here
by no accident. [laughs]

1511
00:59:33,861 --> 00:59:35,738
Some home cooking. You know.

1512
00:59:35,822 --> 00:59:38,616
Sitting there with my aunts
and I'm looking out over the landscape,

1513
00:59:38,700 --> 00:59:41,119
thinking about my ancestors,
thinking about my father,

1514
00:59:41,202 --> 00:59:42,662
thinking about my history.

1515
00:59:42,745 --> 00:59:45,164
I'm like, "Wow, I need to go
to my grandparent's house,

1516
00:59:45,248 --> 00:59:46,416
who are no longer with us."

1517
00:59:46,499 --> 00:59:48,459
I was like, "I have to go
to my grandparent's house."

1518
00:59:48,543 --> 00:59:50,169
"I have to see where my mother was born."

1519
00:59:50,253 --> 00:59:52,046
"I have to see this,
please take me over there."

1520
00:59:52,130 --> 00:59:55,300
So they take me over there.
And I just sit and of course

1521
00:59:55,383 --> 00:59:57,468
I had tears of joy and happiness.

1522
00:59:57,552 --> 00:59:58,803
So much going on

1523
00:59:58,886 --> 01:00:01,097
and we go to the rooftop.
I'm like looking around.

1524
01:00:01,180 --> 01:00:04,183
I'm like breathing in the air
soaking it all up. I'm like, "Ah."

1525
01:00:04,267 --> 01:00:05,435
And I see these walls.

1526
01:00:06,019 --> 01:00:09,188
These walls everywhere
and it's sad, but, you know.

1527
01:00:09,272 --> 01:00:12,817
It is very sad and hopefully we can get
past this at some fucking point.

1528
01:00:12,900 --> 01:00:15,987
But I'm looking out into the village.
I'm focused on the village.

1529
01:00:16,070 --> 01:00:18,448
And I see this mosque
in the middle of the village.

1530
01:00:18,531 --> 01:00:19,949
And I look at my cousin,

1531
01:00:20,033 --> 01:00:21,826
I was like, "How long has
that mosque been there?" He's like,

1532
01:00:22,410 --> 01:00:23,411
"Hundreds of years.

1533
01:00:23,494 --> 01:00:24,871
Like it's been there for
a hot minute, bro."

1534
01:00:24,954 --> 01:00:26,873
I was like, "I have to go pray there."

1535
01:00:26,956 --> 01:00:28,750
"I have to go pray there. I'm sure

1536
01:00:28,833 --> 01:00:30,585
my father prayed there, my grandfather,

1537
01:00:30,668 --> 01:00:32,712
my great-grandfather.
I have to go pray there."

1538
01:00:32,795 --> 01:00:33,630
He was like, "Let's go."

1539
01:00:33,713 --> 01:00:36,424
So we go. And I prayed there.
I was meditating.

1540
01:00:36,507 --> 01:00:38,968
I was like, "Wow, what a beautiful thing,
experiencing this.

1541
01:00:39,052 --> 01:00:40,428
This is amazing."

1542
01:00:40,511 --> 01:00:43,431
And then these,
like, five other guys were like,

1543
01:00:43,514 --> 01:00:45,516
looked up at the clock
and they were like, "Hey, man,

1544
01:00:45,600 --> 01:00:48,227
it's time for our <i>Maghrib</i> prayers."
I'm like, "What?"

1545
01:00:48,311 --> 01:00:52,023
He was like, "Yeah,
go do the call for prayer right now."

1546
01:00:52,106 --> 01:00:54,359
I'm like, "Bro, I'm not gonna do
the call for prayer.

1547
01:00:54,442 --> 01:00:55,693
I just got here, bro."

1548
01:00:55,777 --> 01:00:56,653
[laughing]

1549
01:00:56,736 --> 01:00:59,697
They were like, "But you have the beard."
I'm like, "Not you too, bro."

1550
01:00:59,781 --> 01:01:00,657
"I'm just fat.

1551
01:01:00,740 --> 01:01:02,575
I don't want everybody to see
the chin. You know what I'm saying?"

1552
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:05,036
Then he's like,
"No, you have to do the call for prayer."

1553
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:08,164
"The time is now
and you have to do the call for prayer."

1554
01:01:08,247 --> 01:01:10,083
I'm like, "Bra, I'm not gonna do
the call for prayer."

1555
01:01:10,166 --> 01:01:11,834
And they're like,
"You have to do the call for prayer."

1556
01:01:11,918 --> 01:01:13,127
And they're like,
"You don't know the call for prayer?"

1557
01:01:13,211 --> 01:01:14,879
I was like, "Yeah, of course
I know the call for prayer."

1558
01:01:14,962 --> 01:01:17,382
"But I had to go and
speak into that microphone,

1559
01:01:17,465 --> 01:01:18,341
a little tiny little microphone."

1560
01:01:18,424 --> 01:01:20,176
"For the whole village, bro?"

1561
01:01:20,259 --> 01:01:21,886
"I performed in front
of thousands of people,

1562
01:01:21,969 --> 01:01:25,098
but this is a lot of stress, bro.
Scared to make mistakes."

1563
01:01:25,181 --> 01:01:28,393
"There are religious implications
to this situation."

1564
01:01:28,476 --> 01:01:31,562
And they're like, "No, you have to do it."
I was like, "Okay, I'll do it!"

1565
01:01:31,646 --> 01:01:32,897
And I walk up

1566
01:01:32,980 --> 01:01:35,233
and I was like, "Cousin, be
next to me because I'm nervous.

1567
01:01:35,316 --> 01:01:36,734
Make sure I don't mess up."

1568
01:01:37,443 --> 01:01:39,278
[sighs] So I do the call for prayer.

1569
01:01:39,946 --> 01:01:41,489
Throughout the whole entire village.

1570
01:01:41,572 --> 01:01:44,992
And I'm overcome. I was like,
"Oh, my God, this is amazing."

1571
01:01:45,076 --> 01:01:47,286
"What is this thing
that's been written for me?"

1572
01:01:47,370 --> 01:01:48,913
"I can't believe this happened."

1573
01:01:48,996 --> 01:01:51,040
Right as I'm thinking this a man just

1574
01:01:51,124 --> 01:01:53,334
crashes right into the mosque.
[crash noise]

1575
01:01:53,418 --> 01:01:55,670
"Who did the call for prayer?" Like this.

1576
01:01:55,753 --> 01:01:57,088
And everybody sells me out.

1577
01:01:57,171 --> 01:01:59,424
"This guy. This guy
did the call for prayer."

1578
01:01:59,507 --> 01:02:00,466
[laughing]

1579
01:02:01,050 --> 01:02:02,301
"This guy did the call for prayer."

1580
01:02:02,385 --> 01:02:04,262
I was like, "Forget you all, man.

1581
01:02:04,345 --> 01:02:06,222
You forced me to do the call for prayer!"

1582
01:02:06,305 --> 01:02:07,432
He's like, "Why did you do it?"
I was like,

1583
01:02:07,515 --> 01:02:09,809
"I just told you
they forced me to do the call for prayer."

1584
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:12,729
He goes, "Well, you just
did it ten minutes early, bro."

1585
01:02:12,812 --> 01:02:14,731
"You did it ten minutes early."

1586
01:02:14,814 --> 01:02:17,734
I was like, "That clock is flashing, man.
It's saying it's time."

1587
01:02:17,817 --> 01:02:19,736
He goes, "That clock
is ten minutes ahead."

1588
01:02:19,819 --> 01:02:21,529
I was like, "I didn't know that.
That's a digital clock.

1589
01:02:21,612 --> 01:02:22,613
Push the little buttons

1590
01:02:22,697 --> 01:02:24,699
-and it will fix the whole thing. Okay."
-[laughing]

1591
01:02:24,782 --> 01:02:26,367
"You want me to do it?"

1592
01:02:26,451 --> 01:02:28,202
And he goes, "Wait, wait, wait, wait."

1593
01:02:28,286 --> 01:02:30,204
"I've been in the village my entire life."

1594
01:02:30,288 --> 01:02:31,748
"I know everyone in the village."

1595
01:02:31,831 --> 01:02:34,125
"Who are you? I've never seen you before."

1596
01:02:34,208 --> 01:02:35,376
"Who was your father?"

1597
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:36,627
I tell him who my father is.

1598
01:02:36,711 --> 01:02:39,088
He goes, "Oh, my God."

1599
01:02:39,172 --> 01:02:40,631
He goes, "Oh, my God."

1600
01:02:40,715 --> 01:02:41,716
"Your father is Mustafa?"

1601
01:02:42,341 --> 01:02:44,594
I was like, "Yes, my father is Mustafa."

1602
01:02:45,261 --> 01:02:49,223
He goes, "You know who installed
the sound system in this mosque?"

1603
01:02:49,307 --> 01:02:50,933
"Your father did."

1604
01:02:52,560 --> 01:02:55,438
[applause]

1605
01:03:03,946 --> 01:03:05,823
It was truly one of
the most beautiful things

1606
01:03:05,907 --> 01:03:07,658
I have ever experienced in my life.

1607
01:03:07,742 --> 01:03:09,243
And I had to tell you this story.

1608
01:03:09,327 --> 01:03:11,746
Because just because I'm Palestinian

1609
01:03:11,829 --> 01:03:13,873
and I'm forced to live where I am,

1610
01:03:13,956 --> 01:03:14,916
it's not what it is.

1611
01:03:14,999 --> 01:03:18,127
Houston is the city that raised me.

1612
01:03:18,211 --> 01:03:21,255
And now Netflix is the label that pays me.

1613
01:03:21,339 --> 01:03:22,590
-[loud cheering]
-I love y'all.

1614
01:03:24,050 --> 01:03:26,302
Thank you so much, Houston,
I love you guys.

1615
01:03:26,385 --> 01:03:28,095
[cheering and applause]

1616
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:53,329
{\an8}-[cheering]
-[quirky flute music playing]

1617
01:04:01,212 --> 01:04:03,714
On September 16, 2021,

1618
01:04:03,798 --> 01:04:07,176
Mohammed Mo Amer
would be recognized for his work

1619
01:04:07,260 --> 01:04:10,263
which continues to inspire,
encourage, and of course

1620
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:12,890
make people laugh, while providing

1621
01:04:12,974 --> 01:04:15,518
particularly unique
and valuable encouragement

1622
01:04:15,601 --> 01:04:17,979
to Arab-Americans and other artists

1623
01:04:18,062 --> 01:04:19,939
from underrepresented
minority communities.

1624
01:04:20,022 --> 01:04:21,357
Therefore I--

1625
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:23,651
Therefore I, Sylvester Turner,

1626
01:04:23,734 --> 01:04:25,403
