1
00:00:03,568 --> 00:00:07,181
[music playing]

2
00:02:34,806 --> 00:02:37,331
[Broughten] So, as of this
minute, a gentleman,

3
00:02:37,374 --> 00:02:39,855
Army Ranger Assault Team
Baker One

4
00:02:39,898 --> 00:02:43,119
no longer exists.

5
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:46,296
The presence of American Army
ground troops in this sector

6
00:02:46,340 --> 00:02:49,125
is a direct violation of the
United Nations peace agreement.

7
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:51,823
So you all know what that means.
That's right.

8
00:02:51,867 --> 00:02:54,435
That means
that your government's ass

9
00:02:54,478 --> 00:02:57,046
has got to be protected
in case of capture or death.

10
00:02:57,089 --> 00:02:58,787
You don't have to worry
about that,

11
00:02:58,830 --> 00:03:00,267
Captain Broughten, sir,

12
00:03:00,310 --> 00:03:01,877
I've been farting like
a motherfucker,

13
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,228
so they'll probably send my ass
back to you.

14
00:03:05,272 --> 00:03:07,099
Thanks for your help, Alex.

15
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:09,363
You all know Captain Shannon.

16
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:11,756
CIA covert operations.

17
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:13,802
We are about to mount
an extraction

18
00:03:13,845 --> 00:03:16,587
in a very volatile sector
of this world,

19
00:03:16,631 --> 00:03:21,592
and Shannon's going to fill us
in on the details. Vincent.

20
00:03:21,636 --> 00:03:24,029
Hassim al Haddad.

21
00:03:24,073 --> 00:03:26,684
You've seen his face
all over the news.

22
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:30,427
Responsible for at least
eight embassy bombings

23
00:03:30,471 --> 00:03:34,562
and the deaths of hundreds
of innocent civilians.

24
00:03:34,605 --> 00:03:36,825
And many of your
fellow soldiers.

25
00:03:36,868 --> 00:03:40,350
So listen up.
Here's the mission specs.

26
00:03:40,394 --> 00:03:42,613
We're all going in
under the cover of darkness,

27
00:03:42,657 --> 00:03:45,660
and we will be disguised
as Syrian soldiers.

28
00:03:45,703 --> 00:03:49,751
Our mission is to extract Haddad
at any cost.

29
00:03:49,794 --> 00:03:51,622
You know what?
I'm not mistaken.

30
00:03:51,666 --> 00:03:54,886
This looks like one of
my grandmother's old vibrators.

31
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,331
You ready to save the world
again, buddy?

32
00:04:04,374 --> 00:04:06,115
Is your insurance paid up?

33
00:04:06,158 --> 00:04:08,509
Vince, what's the matter
with you?

34
00:04:08,552 --> 00:04:10,119
I've known you since basic, man.

35
00:04:10,162 --> 00:04:11,903
Never seen you
like this before a mission.

36
00:04:11,947 --> 00:04:13,296
This mission is dirty, Scott.

37
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,124
What do you mean
this mission's dirty?

38
00:04:15,167 --> 00:04:17,344
Last week, I intercepted
a series of transmissions

39
00:04:17,387 --> 00:04:21,217
from our CIA station
in Cyprus to Haddad's people.

40
00:04:21,261 --> 00:04:24,307
-What was the content?
-I didn't have time to decode.

41
00:04:24,351 --> 00:04:26,048
But they were increasing
in frequency the closer

42
00:04:26,091 --> 00:04:27,310
we got the mission time.

43
00:04:27,354 --> 00:04:29,138
And why would they do that

44
00:04:29,181 --> 00:04:31,096
if they weren't
trying to warn Haddad?

45
00:04:31,140 --> 00:04:32,750
Why in God's name would the CIA

46
00:04:32,794 --> 00:04:34,535
call and warn Haddad
we were coming?

47
00:04:34,578 --> 00:04:36,798
That's the question.

48
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:38,321
That's what I'm trying
to figure out.

49
00:04:38,365 --> 00:04:39,975
Somebody's dealing
a hell of a hand of poker

50
00:04:40,018 --> 00:04:41,455
and Haddad's
the million dollar chip.

51
00:04:41,498 --> 00:04:44,240
You, me and the rest
of these dummies

52
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:48,288
we're betting against the house
to see who gets it.

53
00:04:48,331 --> 00:04:52,379
The percentage is always
with the house.

54
00:04:54,468 --> 00:04:58,646
Scotty, don't be surprised
if they're waiting for us.

55
00:05:01,126 --> 00:05:04,521
-[buzzer]
-We're at insertion, saddle up!

56
00:05:04,565 --> 00:05:06,218
[buzzer]

57
00:05:06,262 --> 00:05:07,829
Let's go! Let's go!

58
00:05:07,872 --> 00:05:10,310
[music playing]

59
00:05:12,703 --> 00:05:14,792
[hydraulics hissing]

60
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,830
Thirty years and the Black man
still got to sit

61
00:07:19,874 --> 00:07:21,919
in the back of the fucking boat.

62
00:07:30,667 --> 00:07:33,235
Yes. Yes, I understand.

63
00:07:33,278 --> 00:07:36,499
Sir, the American incursion
is underway.

64
00:07:36,543 --> 00:07:39,937
Good.

65
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:43,419
Amir, the Americans
are close at hand.

66
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:45,203
Do not worry, my brother.

67
00:07:45,247 --> 00:07:46,901
<i>The men are all in place.</i>

68
00:07:46,944 --> 00:07:49,512
The dogs will not get through.

69
00:07:49,556 --> 00:07:50,731
[chuckles]

70
00:07:50,774 --> 00:07:52,384
Good.

71
00:07:52,428 --> 00:07:54,909
[music playing]

72
00:08:15,016 --> 00:08:18,106
You boys ready?

73
00:08:18,149 --> 00:08:19,803
Halloween time
till we get inside.

74
00:08:19,847 --> 00:08:21,152
Let's go.

75
00:08:25,983 --> 00:08:27,681
The lookouts have
lost them, sir.

76
00:08:27,724 --> 00:08:29,944
Should I call Amir?

77
00:08:29,987 --> 00:08:32,076
My brother is very competent.

78
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,384
Do not worry. They won't
be hidden much longer.

79
00:08:38,430 --> 00:08:40,258
All right, let's move out.
Rogoff, take point.

80
00:08:40,302 --> 00:08:41,521
Alright.

81
00:08:45,829 --> 00:08:47,265
[tank engine rumbling]

82
00:09:06,328 --> 00:09:09,157
-[rockets roaring]
-[man] Incoming!

83
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,899
[gunfire]

84
00:09:11,942 --> 00:09:13,465
[explosions]

85
00:09:34,835 --> 00:09:36,314
-Alex.
-Sir?

86
00:09:36,358 --> 00:09:37,707
Give me thermal
on that building.

87
00:09:37,751 --> 00:09:41,276
Right.

88
00:09:41,319 --> 00:09:43,060
What do you got?

89
00:09:43,104 --> 00:09:46,411
[beeping]

90
00:09:46,455 --> 00:09:48,936
[Alex] We've got a house party
on the second floor.

91
00:09:48,979 --> 00:09:51,808
Roses, midgets, butt-nekkid
bitches, the whole nine.

92
00:09:51,852 --> 00:09:53,593
All right, good.

93
00:09:53,636 --> 00:09:56,030
Vince, you take Rogoff,
you plant that C4, alright?

94
00:09:56,073 --> 00:09:57,771
Jim, Jo-Jo, Fenton,
you stick with me.

95
00:09:57,814 --> 00:09:59,903
Once we exit with that package

96
00:09:59,947 --> 00:10:01,731
you blow that school

97
00:10:01,775 --> 00:10:03,037
and you run
like a son of a bitch

98
00:10:03,080 --> 00:10:04,604
back to the LZ.
You got it?

99
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:06,344
You will wait for us.

100
00:10:06,388 --> 00:10:09,086
I always do, my friend.

101
00:10:15,136 --> 00:10:17,225
Alex, stay point. Let's move.

102
00:11:12,149 --> 00:11:17,894
[high-pitched whine]

103
00:11:39,873 --> 00:11:41,962
-Clear.
-All right. Move out.

104
00:11:48,359 --> 00:11:52,015
I look forward to seeing
the surprise on their faces.

105
00:11:59,544 --> 00:12:02,634
All right, boys.
Halloween's over.

106
00:12:14,603 --> 00:12:16,474
This mission is
going easier than that that

107
00:12:16,518 --> 00:12:20,087
20-dollar ho I had in Vegas.

108
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,828
Maybe a little too easy.

109
00:12:24,526 --> 00:12:27,355
-Jo-Jo, you ready?
-Yeah.

110
00:12:36,494 --> 00:12:38,409
Vince, we are ready to go.

111
00:12:40,585 --> 00:12:42,196
-Go ahead.
-Light that candle.

112
00:12:42,239 --> 00:12:44,285
One birthday cake coming up.

113
00:12:59,735 --> 00:13:02,129
[indistinct shouts]

114
00:13:17,492 --> 00:13:19,799
-Clear!
-Clear!

115
00:13:29,852 --> 00:13:31,462
Oh, my God.

116
00:13:31,506 --> 00:13:33,247
Give me this shit!
Take this shit out your ear!

117
00:13:33,290 --> 00:13:35,031
Try to order a pizza or reach
out and touch somebody,

118
00:13:35,075 --> 00:13:36,380
I'll pump one in yo ass!

119
00:13:36,424 --> 00:13:38,469
Shannon was right.

120
00:13:38,513 --> 00:13:40,645
[wincing]

121
00:13:40,689 --> 00:13:41,777
Jo-Jo, are you all right?

122
00:13:41,821 --> 00:13:43,257
I'm hit. It's bad.

123
00:13:43,300 --> 00:13:44,693
-Talk to me. Can you move?
-Yeah. Yeah.

124
00:13:44,736 --> 00:13:46,216
All right, let's move out.

125
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:49,263
Alex, you got him?
Let's go.

126
00:13:51,526 --> 00:13:54,007
They're within the perimeter.
Move the troops now!

127
00:13:54,050 --> 00:13:55,443
Go!

128
00:14:11,720 --> 00:14:13,504
Vince, we got him
but we're blown.

129
00:14:13,548 --> 00:14:16,290
Get out.
Get out!

130
00:14:18,205 --> 00:14:19,815
[screaming]

131
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:28,606
[indistinct shouting]

132
00:14:28,650 --> 00:14:33,002
The school roof!
They're on the school roof.

133
00:14:33,046 --> 00:14:37,485
Okay. That's it.
It's the last one.

134
00:14:37,528 --> 00:14:39,400
Hold it right there, Shannon.

135
00:14:39,443 --> 00:14:40,923
You've been looking
through the wrong mail,

136
00:14:40,967 --> 00:14:42,751
asking too many questions.

137
00:14:42,794 --> 00:14:45,449
We all thought it would be best
if you stayed behind.

138
00:14:45,493 --> 00:14:49,149
So you're all leaving me here
to die.

139
00:14:49,192 --> 00:14:50,890
You're already dead.

140
00:16:06,052 --> 00:16:08,141
[indistinct shouting]

141
00:16:11,187 --> 00:16:13,581
[beeps, high-pitched whine]

142
00:16:24,505 --> 00:16:25,985
[screams]

143
00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:56,319
-Where's Shannon?
-He ordered me out

144
00:16:56,363 --> 00:16:58,365
and then the building blew.

145
00:17:00,323 --> 00:17:02,325
[helicopter blades whirring]

146
00:17:10,420 --> 00:17:12,944
Go, go, go!

147
00:17:14,903 --> 00:17:18,211
Alright, there she is.
Let's move. Let's go. Go.

148
00:17:18,254 --> 00:17:20,517
Go, go.

149
00:17:20,561 --> 00:17:22,215
Move! Move! Move!

150
00:17:23,694 --> 00:17:24,956
Let's go.

151
00:17:31,137 --> 00:17:32,964
Move!

152
00:17:41,538 --> 00:17:42,931
Damn you, Vince.

153
00:18:02,516 --> 00:18:04,779
[groans]

154
00:18:04,822 --> 00:18:07,260
-Shit!
-Jo-Jo!

155
00:18:16,834 --> 00:18:19,272
Alex, see what you can do
for him.

156
00:18:19,315 --> 00:18:21,404
I'm on it, Captain.

157
00:18:21,448 --> 00:18:23,189
Come on, Jo-Jo.
Come on, man.

158
00:18:30,761 --> 00:18:34,765
Still alive,
you sons of bitches!

159
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:38,639
Vince! Vince!
Where are you?!

160
00:18:47,082 --> 00:18:48,910
He's with me.

161
00:18:58,354 --> 00:19:00,487
Well, American...

162
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:03,968
It seems you've
missed your connecting flight.

163
00:19:16,546 --> 00:19:18,505
Alex.

164
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:19,810
How is he?

165
00:19:23,945 --> 00:19:26,208
He had to do it, Captain.
It was for the mission.

166
00:19:28,036 --> 00:19:30,952
Guess what?
Fuck the mission, Rogoff.

167
00:19:30,995 --> 00:19:32,736
And fuck you!

168
00:19:43,138 --> 00:19:45,488
There was an explosion,
and then he disappeared, sir.

169
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:47,142
You should have put a bullet
in his head

170
00:19:47,186 --> 00:19:48,839
while you had the chance,
Goddamn it.

171
00:19:48,883 --> 00:19:50,754
And Langley wants to know
just what the hell they're

172
00:19:50,798 --> 00:19:53,409
supposed to do with Haddad.

173
00:19:53,453 --> 00:19:55,281
The mission
was supposed to fail, Rogoff.

174
00:19:55,324 --> 00:19:57,718
Haddad was supposed
to stay in country.

175
00:19:57,761 --> 00:20:00,155
-We planned for that.
-Well, I guess you didn't plan

176
00:20:00,199 --> 00:20:02,244
-on Broughten.
-Oh, Christ.

177
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:04,203
Don't punk me
around, Lieutenant.

178
00:20:04,246 --> 00:20:06,248
You help Broughten
and his men get out.

179
00:20:06,292 --> 00:20:08,859
-Even blew up a fucking school.
-By that point,

180
00:20:08,903 --> 00:20:10,470
the enemies thought
that they'd been betrayed.

181
00:20:10,513 --> 00:20:11,732
So they would have
killed all of us.

182
00:20:11,775 --> 00:20:13,603
Even me, <i>sir.</i>

183
00:20:13,647 --> 00:20:15,649
Pity they didn't.

184
00:20:19,914 --> 00:20:22,786
Hello, Captain Broughten
for General Smith, please.

185
00:20:22,830 --> 00:20:25,224
He's in a meeting but I'll let
him know you're here.

186
00:20:25,267 --> 00:20:26,616
-Thank you.
-[beep]

187
00:20:26,660 --> 00:20:28,314
-Yeah. <i>
-Captain Broughten</i>

188
00:20:28,357 --> 00:20:29,837
<i>is here, sir,</i><i>
to see you.</i>

189
00:20:29,880 --> 00:20:32,187
-Send him in.
-You can walk right in.

190
00:20:32,231 --> 00:20:34,798
Thank you.

191
00:20:34,842 --> 00:20:37,801
They want to debrief you
at Langley, Rogoff.

192
00:20:37,845 --> 00:20:40,326
After that, get off base
for a few days, disappear.

193
00:21:02,565 --> 00:21:04,741
General Smith.

194
00:21:04,785 --> 00:21:06,439
At ease, captain.

195
00:21:06,482 --> 00:21:09,833
You know, Carter Dell,
Frank Jay, CIA liaisons.

196
00:21:09,877 --> 00:21:11,270
We've met.

197
00:21:11,313 --> 00:21:14,098
Begging your pardon, sir, but...

198
00:21:14,142 --> 00:21:16,840
I was surprised to see
Lieutenant Rogoff in here.

199
00:21:16,884 --> 00:21:18,973
Lieutenant Rogoff was giving us
some deep background

200
00:21:19,016 --> 00:21:21,105
on your mission and your team.

201
00:21:21,149 --> 00:21:24,326
-What background?
-That's classified, captain.

202
00:21:24,370 --> 00:21:26,981
Classified?!
I got a man killed over there,

203
00:21:27,024 --> 00:21:28,591
Dell, and I left
another one behind.

204
00:21:28,635 --> 00:21:30,463
I think that gives me clearance,
don't you?

205
00:21:30,506 --> 00:21:33,248
Stand down, Captain.

206
00:21:33,292 --> 00:21:36,556
Rogoff was giving us additional
intel on Shannon's capture.

207
00:21:38,384 --> 00:21:41,256
Shannon's capture
was my fault, sir.

208
00:21:41,300 --> 00:21:44,433
I made an error in judgment
and I left him behind.

209
00:21:44,477 --> 00:21:46,870
I'd like permission to go back
and bring them in.

210
00:21:46,914 --> 00:21:50,570
I'm sorry, Scott, but...

211
00:21:50,613 --> 00:21:52,659
To be honest with you,

212
00:21:52,702 --> 00:21:55,531
we're glad you left him behind.

213
00:21:55,575 --> 00:21:57,925
-Sir?
-Shannon went bad,

214
00:21:57,968 --> 00:22:00,101
sold intel to the Syrians.

215
00:22:00,144 --> 00:22:03,017
We lost two agents.
Mossad lost seven.

216
00:22:03,060 --> 00:22:04,845
I don't believe you.

217
00:22:04,888 --> 00:22:06,542
We've been watching him
for weeks.

218
00:22:06,586 --> 00:22:09,589
-This mission confirms it.
-Haddad was the bait.

219
00:22:09,632 --> 00:22:12,548
Shannon was going to deliver you
and your men to the terrorists.

220
00:22:12,592 --> 00:22:16,378
They got verifiable evidence
of an illegal U.S.

221
00:22:16,422 --> 00:22:18,641
military incursion
into the Mideast.

222
00:22:18,685 --> 00:22:20,817
The peace talks blew up
in our face.

223
00:22:20,861 --> 00:22:24,995
How else do you think
they knew you were coming?

224
00:22:25,039 --> 00:22:26,867
Vince Shannon told me

225
00:22:26,910 --> 00:22:29,826
that this mission
was going to be compromised.

226
00:22:29,870 --> 00:22:31,175
Now, if he was going
to sell us out,

227
00:22:31,219 --> 00:22:32,916
why would he do that?

228
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:34,875
Oh, you were friends once.

229
00:22:34,918 --> 00:22:37,138
Old loyalties die hard.

230
00:22:37,181 --> 00:22:38,705
Scott...

231
00:22:38,748 --> 00:22:42,926
I gave your team
four weeks' leave.

232
00:22:42,970 --> 00:22:44,798
Forget about all this, huh?

233
00:22:44,841 --> 00:22:48,018
Get off base. Get drunk.

234
00:22:48,062 --> 00:22:50,194
Celebrate with that
pretty wife for yours.

235
00:22:50,238 --> 00:22:53,023
I'm putting you up for Major.

236
00:22:53,067 --> 00:22:56,766
With all due respect, sir,
I prefer to remain a captain.

237
00:22:56,810 --> 00:22:58,812
I have in no way
earned a promotion.

238
00:23:02,250 --> 00:23:03,556
Sir.

239
00:23:21,356 --> 00:23:23,097
He didn't buy it.

240
00:23:23,140 --> 00:23:25,621
Neither would I.

241
00:23:25,665 --> 00:23:27,797
That's a bullshit story.

242
00:23:29,233 --> 00:23:31,235
We have to come up
with something better than that

243
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,194
if we want to cover this up.

244
00:23:33,237 --> 00:23:35,152
Don't worry about it.

245
00:23:35,196 --> 00:23:37,154
We've already started
the intel leaks.

246
00:23:37,198 --> 00:23:39,679
Those terrorists will kill
Shannon by the end of the week,

247
00:23:39,722 --> 00:23:41,811
if the Israelis
don't beat them to it.

248
00:23:46,599 --> 00:23:48,165
Thirsty, American?!

249
00:23:48,209 --> 00:23:50,907
Well, then, eat the bucket.

250
00:23:50,951 --> 00:23:53,127
Sakar! No.

251
00:23:53,170 --> 00:23:54,955
Unchain him.

252
00:23:54,998 --> 00:23:56,957
I want to talk to this man.

253
00:24:02,919 --> 00:24:04,921
Please.

254
00:24:07,533 --> 00:24:10,710
Have some brandy.

255
00:24:10,753 --> 00:24:12,407
My religion forbids me,

256
00:24:12,451 --> 00:24:15,671
but I can enjoy
watching you indulge.

257
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:24,463
I know you didn't bring me up
here to give me a drink.

258
00:24:24,506 --> 00:24:26,116
What are you offering me?

259
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,162
I'm offering you your life.

260
00:24:28,205 --> 00:24:30,904
You can't give me my life back.

261
00:24:30,947 --> 00:24:33,167
God and country...

262
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:36,866
This I can understand.

263
00:24:36,910 --> 00:24:39,826
Our intelligence services
intercepted this transmission

264
00:24:39,869 --> 00:24:42,524
to the Mossad.

265
00:24:42,568 --> 00:24:45,005
It appears you've been branded
a traitor

266
00:24:45,048 --> 00:24:47,747
by your own CIA.

267
00:24:47,790 --> 00:24:52,708
You'll note the encryption code
matches this week's ciphers.

268
00:24:52,752 --> 00:24:54,841
It is an authentic document.

269
00:24:58,975 --> 00:25:01,238
Sold out by your CIA.

270
00:25:03,893 --> 00:25:06,853
Left for dead by your comrades.

271
00:25:23,391 --> 00:25:25,785
You have only your god left.

272
00:25:28,831 --> 00:25:30,964
Or your god.

273
00:25:31,007 --> 00:25:33,793
Not with that whiskey in you.

274
00:25:41,452 --> 00:25:44,412
Listen, I know you didn't
bring me up here

275
00:25:44,455 --> 00:25:47,633
to give me a sermon.
What do you want?

276
00:25:47,676 --> 00:25:49,809
-We want Haddad back.
-Well, go get him!

277
00:25:49,852 --> 00:25:51,724
We want you to help us get him.

278
00:25:56,119 --> 00:25:58,861
I'm a dead man as soon as my
feet hit American soil.

279
00:25:58,905 --> 00:26:00,994
We'll get you in.

280
00:26:01,037 --> 00:26:04,084
America has always opened
its arms to our tired,

281
00:26:04,127 --> 00:26:05,564
huddled masses.

282
00:26:05,607 --> 00:26:07,696
And what? What, come back here

283
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:09,611
and wait for the Israelis
to hit me?

284
00:26:09,655 --> 00:26:12,483
-Man, no, thanks.
-We don't want you here.

285
00:26:12,527 --> 00:26:15,312
But with five million tax-free
American dollars

286
00:26:15,356 --> 00:26:17,097
in a Cayman Island account,

287
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:19,795
you can retire
wherever you want.

288
00:26:19,839 --> 00:26:23,799
A persuasive offer,
don't you think?

289
00:26:23,843 --> 00:26:27,586
Even for a man
without a country.

290
00:26:29,413 --> 00:26:31,677
Do I have to learn the Koran?

291
00:26:45,212 --> 00:26:46,605
Got you some water.

292
00:26:46,648 --> 00:26:48,345
Just put it down.

293
00:26:51,087 --> 00:26:52,915
This thing
is completely stripped.

294
00:26:52,959 --> 00:26:54,656
You should have called
a plumber.

295
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:56,527
Kel, I know what I'm doing,
will you just hand me

296
00:26:56,571 --> 00:26:58,138
the screwdriver, please.

297
00:27:01,794 --> 00:27:03,796
You want it?
Come get it, soldier boy?

298
00:27:03,839 --> 00:27:07,974
Come on, Kel.
I don't have time for this.

299
00:27:08,017 --> 00:27:11,194
Don't have time, huh?
You got plenty of time.

300
00:27:11,238 --> 00:27:12,805
You've been spending
the last two weeks

301
00:27:12,848 --> 00:27:14,110
making all
these home improvements.

302
00:27:14,154 --> 00:27:16,852
We don't even need them.

303
00:27:16,896 --> 00:27:18,985
What is it you're
really trying to fix?

304
00:27:26,514 --> 00:27:29,473
I don't know what I'm trying
to fix, Kel.

305
00:27:29,517 --> 00:27:31,345
Me, the Army, Shannon.

306
00:27:33,390 --> 00:27:35,654
I mean, somebody sells out
my mission

307
00:27:35,697 --> 00:27:37,873
and I get
my best friend captured.

308
00:27:37,917 --> 00:27:39,570
CIA tells me
that he's a traitor,

309
00:27:39,614 --> 00:27:42,878
which there is no way
that I'm going to believe.

310
00:27:42,922 --> 00:27:47,230
And then Smith gives me a
promotion that I don't deserve.

311
00:27:47,274 --> 00:27:48,797
You think they're lying?

312
00:27:48,841 --> 00:27:50,407
Yeah, I know they're lying.

313
00:27:50,451 --> 00:27:52,061
I know they're lying.

314
00:27:52,105 --> 00:27:55,369
Just don't know
which lies to believe anymore.

315
00:27:55,412 --> 00:27:57,763
Why don't you just quit?

316
00:27:57,806 --> 00:28:01,549
You know,
take an early retirement.

317
00:28:01,592 --> 00:28:03,986
I know, I know, I know, the army
is your life and all that.

318
00:28:04,030 --> 00:28:06,162
No, you're wrong.
It's not.

319
00:28:06,206 --> 00:28:08,512
And anymore.

320
00:28:11,124 --> 00:28:14,997
Kel, I want to get away
from all this, okay?

321
00:28:15,041 --> 00:28:18,261
I want to see the world
instead of shoot at it.

322
00:28:20,960 --> 00:28:24,441
I want to lie
on the beach with you.

323
00:28:24,485 --> 00:28:26,226
What's so funny?

324
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:31,579
The beach.

325
00:28:31,622 --> 00:28:34,190
This beach.
Right here.

326
00:28:44,810 --> 00:28:46,986
Senator Branford, I really,

327
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:48,770
really appreciate you coming
on such short notice.

328
00:28:48,814 --> 00:28:50,554
Aw, hell, Scott,
it's good to see you.

329
00:28:50,598 --> 00:28:53,949
Sorry about the office.
Got a hell of a view though.

330
00:28:53,993 --> 00:28:56,256
How's that wife of yours?
Any children yet?

331
00:28:56,299 --> 00:28:58,084
Well, my wife's fine, sir.
Thank you.

332
00:28:58,127 --> 00:29:01,348
And no, no children.
Not yet.

333
00:29:01,391 --> 00:29:03,306
That's good, because
you stepped yourself

334
00:29:03,350 --> 00:29:05,265
into a big ol' pile
of horseshit on this one.

335
00:29:05,308 --> 00:29:08,094
I hate to see you leave any
little ones behind.

336
00:29:08,137 --> 00:29:10,574
-Sir, is it really that bad?
-I've been keeping an eye

337
00:29:10,618 --> 00:29:12,707
on your Ranger unit
for a couple of months now.

338
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:15,754
All your little incursions
into foreign territory.

339
00:29:15,797 --> 00:29:17,799
What do you call it?
Hunting trips.

340
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:22,456
Sir, it's my job.
Black Ops. It's what we do.

341
00:29:22,499 --> 00:29:24,066
According to the amended
Constitution of

342
00:29:24,110 --> 00:29:28,331
the United States,
your job is illegal as hell.

343
00:29:28,375 --> 00:29:31,334
Your daddy, my esteemed mentor
in the halls of Congress,

344
00:29:31,378 --> 00:29:36,383
is probably turning over in his
expensive mausoleum right now.

345
00:29:36,426 --> 00:29:39,081
I would say you're probably
right about that, sir.

346
00:29:41,867 --> 00:29:45,261
Now, Scott, we've been turning
our heads, looking the other way

347
00:29:45,305 --> 00:29:47,960
in the interest
of national security.

348
00:29:48,003 --> 00:29:51,137
But this time your brass
gone too far.

349
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:53,008
They brokered a deal
between the CIA

350
00:29:53,052 --> 00:29:55,968
and a known terrorist leader
named Haddad.

351
00:29:59,014 --> 00:30:01,147
Is any of this ringing a bell?

352
00:30:01,190 --> 00:30:04,977
Yes, sir, Shannon, uh --
Shannon said something about it.

353
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,717
-Shannon -- he was...

354
00:30:06,761 --> 00:30:09,459
He was on assignment
working for the CIA.

355
00:30:09,503 --> 00:30:10,939
Isn't that right?

356
00:30:10,983 --> 00:30:12,506
He intercepted
some transmission, sir,

357
00:30:12,549 --> 00:30:15,161
but he didn't
give me any details.

358
00:30:15,204 --> 00:30:17,424
And you boys left him to die
when you sprung Haddad,

359
00:30:17,467 --> 00:30:19,774
who wasn't supposed to get
sprung -- is that correct?

360
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:22,124
I have no comment on that, sir.

361
00:30:22,168 --> 00:30:25,388
You know, they're saying
that Shannon went bad.

362
00:30:25,432 --> 00:30:26,955
Yeah, I know
what they're saying, sir.

363
00:30:26,999 --> 00:30:29,044
And begging your pardon,
it's all CIA bullshit.

364
00:30:29,088 --> 00:30:31,873
-They're hiding something.
-Of course they are.

365
00:30:31,917 --> 00:30:34,397
It's a hell of lot easier to
prove if you come on in

366
00:30:34,441 --> 00:30:36,486
and talk to us,
just you and me.

367
00:30:36,530 --> 00:30:38,837
I'll take your deposition
in private.

368
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,360
No one else has to know.

369
00:30:40,403 --> 00:30:42,579
-It's a little risky, sir.
-You know, Scott,

370
00:30:42,623 --> 00:30:44,016
the best piece
of political advice

371
00:30:44,059 --> 00:30:45,408
I ever got was from your dad,

372
00:30:45,452 --> 00:30:47,062
and he got it
from Lyndon Johnson.

373
00:30:47,106 --> 00:30:48,716
It goes like this:
Your ass is up against the wall,

374
00:30:48,759 --> 00:30:50,718
you call the other guy
a horse diddler.

375
00:30:50,761 --> 00:30:54,026
Maybe he ain't, but he's going
to be real busy denying it.

376
00:30:54,069 --> 00:30:57,246
You testify
against those CIA boys,

377
00:30:57,290 --> 00:30:59,292
they're going to be too busy
denying high crimes

378
00:30:59,335 --> 00:31:01,381
and misdemeanors to bother you.

379
00:31:01,424 --> 00:31:02,904
Sir, with all due respect,

380
00:31:02,948 --> 00:31:04,471
I think I
could do more on the inside.

381
00:31:04,514 --> 00:31:06,125
I appreciate you coming.

382
00:31:06,168 --> 00:31:07,866
Watch your ass, Scott.

383
00:31:07,909 --> 00:31:11,043
These spy boys, they...

384
00:31:11,086 --> 00:31:12,740
They play dirty.

385
00:31:12,783 --> 00:31:14,133
And they start to figure out

386
00:31:14,176 --> 00:31:15,699
that you're not believing
their lies,

387
00:31:15,743 --> 00:31:17,397
they're going to take you out.

388
00:31:17,440 --> 00:31:19,834
And that pretty
little wife of yours,

389
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,662
she becomes a widow.

390
00:31:21,705 --> 00:31:24,447
I'll keep you posted, sir.

391
00:31:24,491 --> 00:31:26,058
If you live that long.

392
00:31:36,677 --> 00:31:38,461
[telephone ringing]

393
00:31:42,161 --> 00:31:45,033
-Smith.
-We've got a problem.

394
00:31:45,077 --> 00:31:48,950
<i>-What?</i>
-Shannon's still alive.

395
00:31:48,994 --> 00:31:50,604
Hasn't Mossad tried to
hit him yet?

396
00:31:50,647 --> 00:31:53,128
That's the problem.
They can't find him.

397
00:31:53,172 --> 00:31:55,000
He went to ground 48 hours ago.

398
00:31:55,043 --> 00:31:57,785
I don't care how you do it,

399
00:31:57,828 --> 00:32:01,615
but I want him dead before
he turns up on the evening news.

400
00:32:01,658 --> 00:32:03,269
Or before we do.

401
00:32:03,312 --> 00:32:05,140
<i>You got it?</i>

402
00:32:05,184 --> 00:32:06,489
I've got it.

403
00:32:15,846 --> 00:32:18,458
-I'm ready.
-So am I.

404
00:32:21,765 --> 00:32:25,987
[door opens, closes]

405
00:32:26,031 --> 00:32:28,685
[glass breaks]

406
00:32:28,729 --> 00:32:29,948
[music playing]

407
00:33:06,593 --> 00:33:08,290
Hey, Dell!

408
00:33:15,515 --> 00:33:17,343
Shannon.

409
00:33:17,386 --> 00:33:19,301
Where have you been?
We've been looking for you.

410
00:33:19,345 --> 00:33:21,216
You know, that's funny,

411
00:33:21,260 --> 00:33:23,479
'cause I've been looking for
you, too.

412
00:33:40,322 --> 00:33:43,369
[music playing]

413
00:34:10,918 --> 00:34:12,528
[beeping]

414
00:34:59,053 --> 00:35:02,535
<i>[man] He's dead, sir.</i><i>
He was literally blown away.</i>

415
00:35:02,578 --> 00:35:04,928
Just --
Just give me the facts.

416
00:35:04,972 --> 00:35:07,322
<i>My full report will be ready</i><i>
within the hour, sir.</i>

417
00:35:07,366 --> 00:35:09,324
I'll be back on base by morning.

418
00:35:14,112 --> 00:35:16,244
Broughten, thank God.

419
00:35:16,288 --> 00:35:19,682
This is Jim Kenner,
Carter Dell's control at CIA.

420
00:35:19,726 --> 00:35:23,033
Nice to meet you.
What have you got?

421
00:35:23,077 --> 00:35:24,992
We have reason to believe
that our Mideastern friends

422
00:35:25,035 --> 00:35:26,950
have stepped up terrorist
activities in this country

423
00:35:26,994 --> 00:35:28,474
as reprisals for your mission.

424
00:35:28,517 --> 00:35:30,302
If Shannon was working
with them,

425
00:35:30,345 --> 00:35:31,825
he'd naturally go
after high profile

426
00:35:31,868 --> 00:35:34,436
targets in
the intelligence community.

427
00:35:34,480 --> 00:35:38,614
When he was assigned to CIA,
Dell was his control.

428
00:35:38,658 --> 00:35:41,269
-What's his motive?
-Didn't you brief him, Smith?

429
00:35:43,402 --> 00:35:45,317
Shannon's been working
for them all along.

430
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:48,885
-He's part of their team.
-Could be revenge.

431
00:35:48,929 --> 00:35:50,713
Revenge?

432
00:35:50,757 --> 00:35:53,499
Why didn't he come after me?

433
00:35:53,542 --> 00:35:55,414
He may.

434
00:35:55,457 --> 00:35:59,331
Look, if Vince Shannon is really
working for the terrorists,

435
00:35:59,374 --> 00:36:01,028
I think they're looking
for Haddad.

436
00:36:01,071 --> 00:36:03,900
That's impossible.
He's buried deep.

437
00:36:03,944 --> 00:36:06,033
Did it ever occur to you,
Agent Kenner,

438
00:36:06,076 --> 00:36:09,515
that maybe these killings
are just a decoy to keep us busy

439
00:36:09,558 --> 00:36:11,473
while they spring Haddad?

440
00:36:11,517 --> 00:36:13,388
You could be right,
but it won't happen.

441
00:36:13,432 --> 00:36:15,738
Haddad's been put in the loop,
and they'll never find him.

442
00:36:15,782 --> 00:36:17,175
-Yeah, well, don't bet on it.
-[telephone rings]

443
00:36:17,218 --> 00:36:20,352
Excuse me.

444
00:36:20,395 --> 00:36:22,702
Sorry about your vacation,
but I'm going to need you back

445
00:36:22,745 --> 00:36:24,791
on base by tomorrow night.

446
00:36:24,834 --> 00:36:26,793
Look, if...

447
00:36:26,836 --> 00:36:29,883
If Shannon did grease Dell
to decoy us,

448
00:36:29,926 --> 00:36:32,668
then he'll do it again.

449
00:36:32,712 --> 00:36:35,932
Sir, I'll be back
on base tomorrow night.

450
00:36:35,976 --> 00:36:38,326
But there is no way
that he's turned.

451
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:58,520
Need I remind you that our
mission is to free Haddad,

452
00:36:58,564 --> 00:37:00,740
not get even
with your former comrades.

453
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:03,699
Yeah, well, I'm in this
for the money.

454
00:37:03,743 --> 00:37:06,528
We also have an agenda, Captain.

455
00:37:06,572 --> 00:37:08,878
Okay, here's how it works.

456
00:37:08,922 --> 00:37:11,751
By now, Haddad's in the loop.

457
00:37:11,794 --> 00:37:13,970
I have access
to his transport file.

458
00:37:14,014 --> 00:37:15,798
I need to know
where to make the landing.

459
00:37:15,842 --> 00:37:17,365
Eventually,
they'll drop him somewhere

460
00:37:17,409 --> 00:37:18,845
you can find him --
you and your boys

461
00:37:18,888 --> 00:37:20,760
can go in there,
drag his ass out of Dodge

462
00:37:20,803 --> 00:37:23,066
and be back to Mecca
in time for tea.

463
00:37:23,110 --> 00:37:26,505
So why endanger our mission with
your own private war of revenge?

464
00:37:26,548 --> 00:37:28,333
You gave me the background
on these motherfuckers.

465
00:37:28,376 --> 00:37:29,812
What'd you think I'd do?

466
00:37:29,856 --> 00:37:31,510
I made an error in judgment.

467
00:37:31,553 --> 00:37:33,468
Maybe.

468
00:37:33,512 --> 00:37:35,905
You got anybody around here
that can shoot this?

469
00:37:35,949 --> 00:37:38,168
Kamal.

470
00:37:38,212 --> 00:37:40,823
If you compromise this mission,
I'll kill you.

471
00:37:40,867 --> 00:37:43,609
If I compromise this mission,
we're all dead.

472
00:37:43,652 --> 00:37:45,654
We'll see.

473
00:37:51,791 --> 00:37:53,749
Here's what I need you to do,
man.

474
00:37:56,535 --> 00:37:58,580
I don't trust this man.

475
00:37:58,624 --> 00:38:01,453
He's the devil himself
inside him.

476
00:38:01,496 --> 00:38:03,890
He's nothing
more than a tour guide.

477
00:38:03,933 --> 00:38:07,676
When we have Haddad,
the American dies.

478
00:38:11,201 --> 00:38:14,596
Come on, throw it high!

479
00:38:14,640 --> 00:38:17,556
-You're get the hang of this.
-Told ya I just needed practice.

480
00:38:17,599 --> 00:38:20,123
Whoops!
Spoke too soon.

481
00:38:22,082 --> 00:38:23,823
Come on, Mr. Ranger.

482
00:38:26,042 --> 00:38:29,611
Okay. Okay. All right.
Give it to me.

483
00:38:29,655 --> 00:38:31,134
-Ready?
-Yeah.

484
00:38:31,178 --> 00:38:32,397
Oh.

485
00:38:38,098 --> 00:38:40,100
Gotcha!

486
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:51,633
Nice to see somebody's
having a good time.

487
00:38:51,677 --> 00:38:53,069
How are you doing, Pete?

488
00:38:57,596 --> 00:38:58,988
What's going on?

489
00:38:59,032 --> 00:39:00,729
Just get out of here.

490
00:39:02,731 --> 00:39:05,125
Look, just go, please.
Get out of here!

491
00:39:07,257 --> 00:39:10,304
I'm not going to shoot her,
Pete.

492
00:39:10,348 --> 00:39:11,958
Look, I was under orders.

493
00:39:12,001 --> 00:39:13,525
General Smith gave us
strict instructions

494
00:39:13,568 --> 00:39:15,309
to make sure that you were dead.

495
00:39:15,353 --> 00:39:16,876
Yeah, I know.
They briefed me at Langley.

496
00:39:16,919 --> 00:39:18,530
Smith told me about the mix up.

497
00:39:18,573 --> 00:39:21,228
But we've got more
important things to worry about.

498
00:39:21,271 --> 00:39:23,926
-How'd you get out?
-Forget about that.

499
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:26,233
Look, Haddad's men have put
a hit squad out after us,

500
00:39:26,276 --> 00:39:29,541
and I have to warn Broughten.
You got a cell phone?

501
00:39:32,108 --> 00:39:34,589
What's the, uh, lock code?

502
00:39:34,633 --> 00:39:37,723
-R-A-N-G-E-R.
-"Ranger?"

503
00:39:37,766 --> 00:39:40,726
That's cute.
[chuckles]

504
00:39:40,769 --> 00:39:42,641
It's good to see you, man.

505
00:39:42,684 --> 00:39:46,296
[dialing]

506
00:39:46,340 --> 00:39:48,037
She seems like a nice girl.

507
00:39:48,081 --> 00:39:51,432
She is. We're getting married.

508
00:39:51,476 --> 00:39:54,957
-I don't think so.
-Oh, Vince --

509
00:39:56,698 --> 00:39:57,569
Pete!

510
00:40:01,311 --> 00:40:03,662
[sobbing]

511
00:40:11,757 --> 00:40:13,498
God, I told you,
it's just routine.

512
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:16,979
Yeah, well, what am I supposed
to think, Scott, huh?

513
00:40:17,023 --> 00:40:18,981
Kelly, I'm going back
to the base

514
00:40:19,025 --> 00:40:21,157
and I will
call you in a couple of days.

515
00:40:21,201 --> 00:40:23,856
-Can I visit?
-No, you cannot visit.

516
00:40:26,815 --> 00:40:29,296
Stop worrying, all right?

517
00:40:29,339 --> 00:40:31,124
It's just a, um...

518
00:40:31,167 --> 00:40:33,518
It's a paper shuffle.

519
00:40:33,561 --> 00:40:36,564
You got quiet, Scott.
Whenever you're quiet

520
00:40:36,608 --> 00:40:38,523
you have a mission --

521
00:40:38,566 --> 00:40:41,743
and this time you're worse.

522
00:40:41,787 --> 00:40:44,790
Think I'm lying to you?

523
00:40:44,833 --> 00:40:47,401
I don't know what to believe
anymore, Scott.

524
00:40:47,445 --> 00:40:50,796
I guess I'm not sure which lies
to believe, same as you.

525
00:40:51,797 --> 00:40:53,233
[ringing]

526
00:40:56,410 --> 00:41:00,240
-Broughten.
-Scott. How you doing?

527
00:41:00,283 --> 00:41:04,244
<i>Hey, listen. I just popped</i><i>
a cap in Rogoff's ass.</i>

528
00:41:04,287 --> 00:41:05,811
<i>You're next.</i>

529
00:41:05,854 --> 00:41:07,769
Right after
I go see Alex Fenton.

530
00:41:07,813 --> 00:41:10,337
<i>He still lives</i><i>
in Hillcrest Heights, right?</i>

531
00:41:10,380 --> 00:41:12,078
<i>Yeah. Yeah.</i>

532
00:41:12,121 --> 00:41:14,080
Bye!
-[beeps]

533
00:41:19,215 --> 00:41:21,914
Kelly, I want you
to go upstairs.

534
00:41:21,957 --> 00:41:25,352
And I want you to pack a bag.

535
00:41:25,395 --> 00:41:27,528
And I want you
to go to your mother's.

536
00:41:27,572 --> 00:41:31,140
-Which lies, Scott?
-Just do as I say, please?!

537
00:41:31,184 --> 00:41:33,273
[music playing]

538
00:41:54,076 --> 00:41:59,473
[beeping, ringing]

539
00:41:59,517 --> 00:42:01,475
[woman] David, get that for me,
I'm cooking.

540
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,303
Yeah, yeah, alright, alright,
I hear you.

541
00:42:03,346 --> 00:42:05,218
I didn't marry you for your
cooking, anyway.

542
00:42:05,261 --> 00:42:06,741
[ringing]

543
00:42:06,785 --> 00:42:08,308
Boo, you know where I put
the cellphone?

544
00:42:08,351 --> 00:42:10,179
[woman] I dunno!

545
00:42:10,223 --> 00:42:12,530
Found it for myself.
Yeah, who this?

546
00:42:12,573 --> 00:42:16,055
Fenton! Shannon's alive.

547
00:42:16,098 --> 00:42:18,013
-What? <i>
-He killed Rogoff,</i>

548
00:42:18,057 --> 00:42:19,885
<i>and now he's coming for us.</i>

549
00:42:19,928 --> 00:42:22,627
<i>Get your wife, get out of</i><i>
that house right now.</i>

550
00:42:27,545 --> 00:42:31,113
Oh, shit!
Boo! Out the back door now!

551
00:42:42,472 --> 00:42:44,953
[screaming, sobbing]

552
00:42:44,997 --> 00:42:47,303
[explosions]

553
00:43:08,411 --> 00:43:10,457
[Mrs. Fenton wailing]

554
00:43:10,500 --> 00:43:12,241
You guys alright?

555
00:43:12,285 --> 00:43:13,765
Yeah, we okay, man.

556
00:43:13,808 --> 00:43:16,332
Who in the hell
just blew up my house?

557
00:43:16,376 --> 00:43:18,073
Wait right here, honey.

558
00:43:22,251 --> 00:43:24,776
Now, last I checked, Shannon
was a dark skinned brother.

559
00:43:24,819 --> 00:43:26,604
That ain't Shannon.

560
00:43:26,647 --> 00:43:28,518
[cellphone ringing]

561
00:43:28,562 --> 00:43:30,042
That is.

562
00:43:33,828 --> 00:43:35,830
Shannon.

563
00:43:35,874 --> 00:43:39,399
Hey, Scott.
How was my guy's aim?

564
00:43:39,442 --> 00:43:41,488
Vince. You know,
when I find you...

565
00:43:41,531 --> 00:43:43,751
You're a dead man.

566
00:43:43,795 --> 00:43:46,667
You know what?
I've got Kelly.

567
00:43:46,711 --> 00:43:49,322
And I'm keeping her
until I figure out where

568
00:43:49,365 --> 00:43:51,759
and when to take you
out of the game.

569
00:43:51,803 --> 00:43:53,413
All right?

570
00:43:55,676 --> 00:43:56,808
See you.

571
00:43:56,851 --> 00:43:58,679
Shannon.

572
00:43:59,593 --> 00:44:00,855
Shannon!

573
00:44:03,075 --> 00:44:04,337
Oh, my God.

574
00:44:04,380 --> 00:44:07,688
Captain?

575
00:44:07,732 --> 00:44:11,083
Alex, I need your help.

576
00:44:19,091 --> 00:44:20,832
Your wife going to be okay?

577
00:44:20,875 --> 00:44:24,662
Yeah, she's a'ight, she's
staying with my grandma.

578
00:44:24,705 --> 00:44:26,054
Here he comes.

579
00:44:29,144 --> 00:44:32,060
Who the hell
is this guy, anyway?

580
00:44:32,104 --> 00:44:33,583
It's a family friend.

581
00:44:36,021 --> 00:44:37,936
Scott.

582
00:44:37,979 --> 00:44:39,894
I wasn't expecting company.

583
00:44:39,938 --> 00:44:42,767
Sergeant Alex Fenton.
He's on my team.

584
00:44:42,810 --> 00:44:44,377
I don't suppose you'd like to
testify before

585
00:44:44,420 --> 00:44:46,205
the Senate subcommittee,
would you, Sergeant?

586
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:48,555
A guy like me would probably
just freeze up

587
00:44:48,598 --> 00:44:50,296
in front of a crowd.

588
00:44:50,339 --> 00:44:54,082
-Shannon took my wife.
-He also killed the CIA liaison,

589
00:44:54,126 --> 00:44:55,997
-Dell.
-And one of our men,

590
00:44:56,041 --> 00:44:57,956
Pete Rogoff, I might add.

591
00:44:57,999 --> 00:45:01,002
Maybe the CIA didn't set him up.
Maybe he just went bad.

592
00:45:01,046 --> 00:45:04,223
Yeah, well, maybe he's what
they're trying to cover up.

593
00:45:04,266 --> 00:45:05,572
All right,
so what are your plans?

594
00:45:05,615 --> 00:45:07,792
My plan is to find my wife,

595
00:45:07,835 --> 00:45:09,663
get some fucking answers.

596
00:45:09,707 --> 00:45:13,623
Well, CIA finds him first, they
gon' make him disappear.

597
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:15,060
If you want to get some answers

598
00:45:15,103 --> 00:45:16,888
you better find him
before they do.

599
00:45:16,931 --> 00:45:19,847
If I do that, sitting around
waiting for those answers.

600
00:45:19,891 --> 00:45:22,154
Look, Scott,
if he took your wife,

601
00:45:22,197 --> 00:45:24,417
he wants something from you.

602
00:45:24,460 --> 00:45:27,550
You find out what that is,
you may just survive this game.

603
00:45:27,594 --> 00:45:29,161
You call his hand.

604
00:45:29,204 --> 00:45:31,903
Just make sure
you don't let the CIA sit in.

605
00:45:31,946 --> 00:45:33,295
Captain, we better go.

606
00:45:33,339 --> 00:45:35,558
He'll probably try
to call the base.

607
00:45:35,602 --> 00:45:38,213
You find him, you find Shannon,
you find out what he knows.

608
00:45:38,257 --> 00:45:39,649
You get the information
back to me,

609
00:45:39,693 --> 00:45:43,131
I'll bring you in from the cold.

610
00:45:43,175 --> 00:45:44,437
Both of you.

611
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,439
Come on.

612
00:45:52,837 --> 00:45:55,404
We'll have four choppers later
this afternoon.

613
00:45:58,233 --> 00:46:00,148
You want some coffee, Captain?

614
00:46:08,766 --> 00:46:11,681
[ringing]

615
00:46:11,725 --> 00:46:15,250
[beeps]

616
00:46:15,294 --> 00:46:18,036
General Smith.

617
00:46:18,079 --> 00:46:20,429
General, is Broughten with you?

618
00:46:20,473 --> 00:46:23,606
Let me speak to my wife.

619
00:46:23,650 --> 00:46:26,914
Sure thing, old buddy.

620
00:46:26,958 --> 00:46:30,788
-Scott!
-Kelly?!

621
00:46:30,831 --> 00:46:34,487
That's our show
for today, folks.

622
00:46:34,530 --> 00:46:37,055
Vince, what do you want?

623
00:46:37,098 --> 00:46:38,752
<i>A game.</i>

624
00:46:38,796 --> 00:46:41,059
And this time I'm the house.

625
00:46:41,102 --> 00:46:43,235
Meet me at yours.

626
00:46:48,370 --> 00:46:50,372
What's he mean by
"now I'm the house"?

627
00:46:50,416 --> 00:46:53,071
Poker.

628
00:46:53,114 --> 00:46:54,942
Percentage is always
with the house.

629
00:46:54,986 --> 00:46:56,683
House rules, his rules.

630
00:46:56,726 --> 00:47:00,208
So now what do we do?

631
00:47:00,252 --> 00:47:02,297
We give him a game.

632
00:47:02,341 --> 00:47:05,953
You just wait for him to show up
and put a bullet in your head?

633
00:47:05,997 --> 00:47:07,650
No, sir.

634
00:47:07,694 --> 00:47:10,392
I think he'll do something
with a little more flair.

635
00:47:10,436 --> 00:47:12,177
We'll send along some watchers.

636
00:47:16,398 --> 00:47:18,357
Blocked.
I didn't get it.

637
00:47:27,366 --> 00:47:29,020
Eh, look at this.

638
00:47:29,063 --> 00:47:30,673
Somebody left it
outside the front door.

639
00:47:30,717 --> 00:47:32,284
I tripped over it.
You have kids?

640
00:47:32,327 --> 00:47:34,025
-You don't have kids.
-Give it to me.

641
00:47:35,591 --> 00:47:37,419
[both] Smith!

642
00:47:38,420 --> 00:47:41,119
[music playing]

643
00:47:53,218 --> 00:47:55,263
[indistinct voices,
woman giggling]

644
00:48:21,115 --> 00:48:22,987
[woman] Bye-bye, General.

645
00:48:55,976 --> 00:48:57,673
General Smith,

646
00:48:57,717 --> 00:49:00,154
how you doing?

647
00:49:00,198 --> 00:49:03,331
Shannon.

648
00:49:03,375 --> 00:49:06,030
-We can deal.
-Sure we can. You talk.

649
00:49:06,073 --> 00:49:07,770
I'll hang on your every word.

650
00:49:07,814 --> 00:49:09,468
So why didn't you guys
want Haddad?

651
00:49:09,511 --> 00:49:11,122
The man's a butcher.

652
00:49:11,165 --> 00:49:13,646
Tensions are rising
in the Middle East.

653
00:49:13,689 --> 00:49:15,517
His continued presence
and strength

654
00:49:15,561 --> 00:49:17,171
is a stabilizing influence.

655
00:49:17,215 --> 00:49:19,739
Oh, so, he's a butcher,
but he's our butcher?

656
00:49:19,782 --> 00:49:23,090
So why did you guys send in
Rangers if you didn't want him?

657
00:49:23,134 --> 00:49:25,832
-If he defeated --
-Murdered.

658
00:49:27,834 --> 00:49:29,967
Murdered...

659
00:49:30,010 --> 00:49:32,795
American soldiers...

660
00:49:32,839 --> 00:49:36,016
He'd increase his power base
in the region

661
00:49:36,060 --> 00:49:39,106
thereby fitting in with
our foreign policy objectives.

662
00:49:39,150 --> 00:49:41,021
How do you sleep at night?

663
00:49:42,892 --> 00:49:45,634
There's more to this
than you know.

664
00:49:45,678 --> 00:49:47,593
Others involved.

665
00:49:47,636 --> 00:49:49,682
Issues of national security.

666
00:49:49,725 --> 00:49:52,728
What others?
The Rangers?

667
00:49:52,772 --> 00:49:54,687
All of them?

668
00:50:00,954 --> 00:50:03,652
Rogoff was CIA, not the others.

669
00:50:05,741 --> 00:50:08,440
He was supposed to take you
out personally.

670
00:50:08,483 --> 00:50:11,312
Not Broughten?
Not Alex Fenton?

671
00:50:11,356 --> 00:50:12,966
No.

672
00:50:22,889 --> 00:50:26,023
How are you going to keep
Broughten from asking questions?

673
00:50:28,155 --> 00:50:32,768
We couldn't...
so he was supposed to die.

674
00:50:32,812 --> 00:50:35,510
-Heroically.
-When?

675
00:50:35,554 --> 00:50:38,470
As soon as he found you.

676
00:50:38,513 --> 00:50:41,255
Or as soon as you killed him.

677
00:50:41,299 --> 00:50:43,910
So I've been a patsy
in all this.

678
00:50:43,953 --> 00:50:45,781
We were improvising.

679
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:50,873
You were very helpful.

680
00:50:50,917 --> 00:50:54,703
That's beautiful.
Very clean.

681
00:50:54,747 --> 00:50:57,576
And you still get a dead hero.

682
00:50:57,619 --> 00:50:59,404
That always helps when you need
additional funding

683
00:50:59,447 --> 00:51:01,406
from Congress, doesn't it?

684
00:51:01,449 --> 00:51:05,497
Another dead Ranger
giving his all for his country.

685
00:51:05,540 --> 00:51:09,240
Rangers are paid to die.

686
00:51:12,156 --> 00:51:15,724
I got a whole new set
of problems to deal with.

687
00:51:15,768 --> 00:51:17,509
Starting with you.

688
00:51:17,552 --> 00:51:19,598
There's a bomb upstairs.

689
00:51:19,641 --> 00:51:21,817
Should be about
two minutes left.

690
00:51:23,950 --> 00:51:25,647
Shannon!

691
00:51:29,303 --> 00:51:30,609
[timer beeping]

692
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:33,193
[screams]

693
00:52:52,647 --> 00:52:54,083
There he is!

694
00:53:35,777 --> 00:53:38,911
Do me a favor, take out that
car, go for his tires.

695
00:53:38,954 --> 00:53:41,087
Fuck his tires,
I'm goin' for his ass!

696
00:54:00,454 --> 00:54:02,587
You missed every tire
on the car.

697
00:54:12,988 --> 00:54:15,339
-Son of a bitch!
-I'm out!

698
00:54:15,382 --> 00:54:17,297
-Take the wheel!
-Got it!

699
00:55:03,430 --> 00:55:05,127
-You ready?
-All day long.

700
00:55:05,171 --> 00:55:06,303
Move.

701
00:55:23,798 --> 00:55:26,758
Vince!

702
00:55:26,801 --> 00:55:29,543
You want to play?!
Come on!

703
00:55:39,118 --> 00:55:41,512
-Coffee's hot.
-I don't want it.

704
00:55:43,383 --> 00:55:45,080
I brought you two hash browns.

705
00:55:45,124 --> 00:55:47,822
I always like two,
it starches up your day.

706
00:55:50,695 --> 00:55:52,566
Why are you doing this?

707
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:55,047
Juice?

708
00:55:55,090 --> 00:55:57,919
Why are you doing this,
Goddamn it?!

709
00:55:59,617 --> 00:56:01,967
I thought we were friends.
I thought you and Scott

710
00:56:02,010 --> 00:56:03,229
were friends.

711
00:56:11,672 --> 00:56:13,631
I'm not going to hurt you,
Kelly.

712
00:56:13,674 --> 00:56:16,198
And I'm not going
to let anyone hurt you.

713
00:56:16,242 --> 00:56:18,026
But I need time.

714
00:56:18,070 --> 00:56:23,684
And as long as I have you
I control your husband.

715
00:56:23,728 --> 00:56:25,512
Don't count on it.

716
00:56:25,556 --> 00:56:28,820
[music playing]

717
00:56:34,086 --> 00:56:35,740
-Go.
-Yes, Colonel.

718
00:56:47,186 --> 00:56:50,668
I have lost three good men
to your foolishness.

719
00:56:50,711 --> 00:56:53,845
And to now this little woman.

720
00:56:53,888 --> 00:56:57,065
Psychological warfare,
keeping yo' ass safe,

721
00:56:57,109 --> 00:56:59,285
sound and hidden.
So get off mine.

722
00:56:59,328 --> 00:57:01,679
I have troops waiting off
your Eastern seaboard.

723
00:57:01,722 --> 00:57:04,421
I must have
landing coordinates now.

724
00:57:04,464 --> 00:57:07,772
Right now Haddad is in transit.

725
00:57:07,815 --> 00:57:10,470
What are they taking him?

726
00:57:10,514 --> 00:57:14,605
Within a few hours, we will know
his exact destination.

727
00:57:14,648 --> 00:57:16,955
You'll have
your landing coordinates.

728
00:57:16,998 --> 00:57:20,741
Right now, I'm trying to secure
these trucks you requested.

729
00:57:20,785 --> 00:57:23,570
It takes time.

730
00:57:23,614 --> 00:57:25,485
-Get up!
-[screaming]

731
00:57:30,795 --> 00:57:33,406
Give us Haddad now,
or I shoot this woman!

732
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:40,544
Hammad, no!

733
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:54,862
You need me.

734
00:57:54,906 --> 00:57:56,473
To get at Haddad.

735
00:57:58,431 --> 00:58:00,607
I need you

736
00:58:00,651 --> 00:58:03,436
to get out
of this country alive.

737
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:05,917
Let's build on that
for a better future.

738
00:58:08,006 --> 00:58:09,790
Enough.

739
00:58:09,834 --> 00:58:11,531
Lower your weapons.

740
00:58:13,707 --> 00:58:15,274
Lower them.

741
00:58:55,227 --> 00:58:57,708
He is insane.

742
00:58:57,751 --> 00:58:59,927
His madness is all we have.

743
00:59:03,888 --> 00:59:05,846
Oh! Oh, my God!

744
00:59:09,676 --> 00:59:12,287
Sorry, man, I never -- I never
meant for that to happen.

745
00:59:12,331 --> 00:59:14,420
I never meant for you
to be part of that.

746
00:59:14,463 --> 00:59:17,858
Then, please, just take me back
to him, take me back to him!

747
00:59:17,902 --> 00:59:21,688
I will, I will. I promise.
Just not yet.

748
00:59:21,732 --> 00:59:23,560
When?

749
00:59:23,603 --> 00:59:25,257
If I pull this off,

750
00:59:25,300 --> 00:59:28,129
you and Scott are going to be on
a beach somewhere

751
00:59:28,173 --> 00:59:29,914
making babies

752
00:59:29,957 --> 00:59:32,220
and all of these bastards
will be dead.

753
00:59:32,264 --> 00:59:34,745
You can't keep fucking
with our lives like that.

754
00:59:34,788 --> 00:59:38,096
I don't --
I don't have any choice.

755
00:59:38,139 --> 00:59:40,838
As long as I control the play,
you and Scott stay alive.

756
00:59:40,881 --> 00:59:43,449
You understand what I'm saying?

757
00:59:43,492 --> 00:59:45,538
You threatened him.
You wanted him dead.

758
00:59:45,582 --> 00:59:47,235
I was wrong.

759
00:59:47,279 --> 00:59:50,412
But now his own people
are going to kill him

760
00:59:50,456 --> 00:59:52,153
unless I can warn him.

761
00:59:52,197 --> 00:59:55,417
And to do that,
I need you, Kelly.

762
00:59:55,461 --> 00:59:58,029
It's the only way he's going to
come talk to me without a gun.

763
00:59:58,072 --> 00:59:59,900
His own people?
This is America.

764
00:59:59,944 --> 01:00:01,772
Yeah, America, America,
the beautiful,

765
01:00:01,815 --> 01:00:03,469
salute, the fucking flag.

766
01:00:03,512 --> 01:00:05,689
Except when there's money
and power involved.

767
01:00:07,473 --> 01:00:10,737
What about you? What about
all the people that you killed?

768
01:00:13,653 --> 01:00:15,524
Only the ones that went bad.

769
01:00:30,365 --> 01:00:32,541
We've been set up for months.

770
01:00:32,585 --> 01:00:35,109
It was a rogue CIA scheme
to keep

771
01:00:35,153 --> 01:00:37,764
some Middle Eastern
dictator in power.

772
01:00:37,808 --> 01:00:40,027
They were going to let him
kill a Ranger team

773
01:00:40,071 --> 01:00:41,812
on a failed kidnapping.

774
01:00:41,855 --> 01:00:43,770
And I thought Scott
was involved.

775
01:00:43,814 --> 01:00:45,642
Scott would never have anything
to do with that.

776
01:00:45,685 --> 01:00:47,992
You should know that.

777
01:00:48,035 --> 01:00:49,733
Has he said anything that you.

778
01:00:49,776 --> 01:00:51,865
Mm.

779
01:00:51,909 --> 01:00:54,172
He said, uh...

780
01:00:54,215 --> 01:00:57,218
He said he didn't know
which lies to believe any more.

781
01:01:00,352 --> 01:01:02,310
Believe mine.

782
01:01:02,354 --> 01:01:04,922
And Scott's going to get out of
this bloodbath alive.

783
01:01:07,228 --> 01:01:08,926
I have, uh...

784
01:01:08,969 --> 01:01:11,406
Really fucked this up.

785
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:13,495
And I gotta...

786
01:01:13,539 --> 01:01:15,410
try and stop what I started.

787
01:01:17,630 --> 01:01:20,328
You just got to trust me.

788
01:01:20,372 --> 01:01:22,113
You never knew when to give up.

789
01:01:22,156 --> 01:01:23,592
[chuckles]

790
01:01:23,636 --> 01:01:27,031
I gave up on you.

791
01:01:27,074 --> 01:01:30,077
Thanks for making me
not have to choose.

792
01:01:30,121 --> 01:01:33,602
You never were good at
making decisions anyway, right?

793
01:01:33,646 --> 01:01:36,605
Go to hell.

794
01:01:36,649 --> 01:01:38,085
I'm there already.

795
01:01:40,218 --> 01:01:42,699
Why would Shannon kill
General Smith?

796
01:01:42,742 --> 01:01:44,788
Revenge, maybe.
I mean, Smith is the guy

797
01:01:44,831 --> 01:01:46,659
that sends us in on the mission.

798
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,922
-I think Smith knew something.
-I think you're right.

799
01:01:48,966 --> 01:01:51,620
I think Shannon killed him
for some answers.

800
01:01:51,664 --> 01:01:54,188
The question is, did he get
the answers he wanted?

801
01:01:54,232 --> 01:01:55,929
That means we've got
to find him.

802
01:01:55,973 --> 01:01:57,583
-We will.
-Don't count on it.

803
01:01:57,626 --> 01:02:00,978
With Smith dead and Shannon
full of secrets,

804
01:02:01,021 --> 01:02:02,501
they're going to
want you involved.

805
01:02:02,544 --> 01:02:04,546
They don't want you
to beat them to him.

806
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:06,548
Why do you keep saying they?
I mean, who are they?

807
01:02:06,592 --> 01:02:07,985
The agency?

808
01:02:08,028 --> 01:02:09,247
It's a big question,
isn't it, Alex?

809
01:02:09,290 --> 01:02:11,031
I think it's a rogue operation.

810
01:02:11,075 --> 01:02:13,033
Too many outsiders
for an agency deal.

811
01:02:13,077 --> 01:02:15,209
They like to keep things
in the family.

812
01:02:15,253 --> 01:02:17,951
We're seeing Kenner later on,
how do you want to play that?

813
01:02:17,995 --> 01:02:19,779
Play it straight.
Frightened.

814
01:02:19,823 --> 01:02:21,476
Very frightened
for your wife -- and angry.

815
01:02:21,520 --> 01:02:22,956
That's not going to be
too difficult.

816
01:02:23,000 --> 01:02:24,741
Play a patriotic,
undying loyalty

817
01:02:24,784 --> 01:02:26,743
to your commanding officer.
You know, General Smith

818
01:02:26,786 --> 01:02:28,832
was your C.O. all that,
they'll take you off the case

819
01:02:28,875 --> 01:02:30,790
for your own good.

820
01:02:30,834 --> 01:02:33,837
You argue with them, then get
the hell out of the office.

821
01:02:33,880 --> 01:02:37,318
-And then what?
-Use yourselves as bait.

822
01:02:37,362 --> 01:02:39,103
He's got watchers out there.

823
01:02:39,146 --> 01:02:41,018
He'll know that
you're off the case.

824
01:02:41,061 --> 01:02:42,367
He'll find you.

825
01:02:42,410 --> 01:02:44,586
Just make sure he does.

826
01:02:51,158 --> 01:02:54,422
-Where are we?
-The truck. Relax.

827
01:03:10,177 --> 01:03:11,962
[man]
Welcome to Atlanta, gentlemen,

828
01:03:12,005 --> 01:03:15,226
you can go right through
holding cells downstairs.

829
01:03:15,269 --> 01:03:17,010
Thanks.

830
01:03:32,156 --> 01:03:34,114
Gentlemen, I'm afraid we're
gonna have to pull you

831
01:03:34,158 --> 01:03:35,855
in out of the cold on this.

832
01:03:35,899 --> 01:03:38,075
It's too dangerous.
We've lost too many good men.

833
01:03:38,118 --> 01:03:39,424
Wait a minute.
What about my wife?

834
01:03:39,467 --> 01:03:40,991
It's not too dangerous for her.

835
01:03:41,034 --> 01:03:42,427
Truly sorry about that.

836
01:03:42,470 --> 01:03:44,168
We're doing everything
we possibly can.

837
01:03:44,211 --> 01:03:47,040
Yeah, I'll bet. Listen,
Kenner, we're the only ones

838
01:03:47,084 --> 01:03:48,868
who have
a chance of getting Shannon.

839
01:03:48,912 --> 01:03:51,305
-'Less you don't want him found.
-I want you both to return

840
01:03:51,349 --> 01:03:53,307
to standard duties
until further notice.

841
01:03:53,351 --> 01:03:56,136
Hey.

842
01:03:56,180 --> 01:03:59,096
You're not my C.O.
That was Smith.

843
01:03:59,139 --> 01:04:01,185
And you bastards got him killed.

844
01:04:01,228 --> 01:04:04,275
So I am through taking orders
from CIA. You got that?

845
01:04:08,714 --> 01:04:10,716
-And what about you?
-What do you mean,

846
01:04:10,759 --> 01:04:12,979
what about me?
Listen, Agent Kenner,

847
01:04:13,023 --> 01:04:16,156
officially we're still on leave,
okay, so dig this.

848
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:19,246
All right, here's a 20.
Take this.

849
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:22,293
Take you and Phil Drummond from
"Different Strokes" here,

850
01:04:22,336 --> 01:04:24,686
and you guys going to have
a lap dance on me?

851
01:04:24,730 --> 01:04:28,603
Okay? Hey, could somebody order
these two some Viagra?

852
01:04:28,647 --> 01:04:30,214
Cute.

853
01:04:30,257 --> 01:04:32,129
Still planning
to use them as bait?

854
01:04:32,172 --> 01:04:33,913
-[cellphone rings]
-Get a surveillance van ready.

855
01:04:33,957 --> 01:04:36,611
Kenner.

856
01:04:36,655 --> 01:04:39,397
-So what's next?
-What's next for who?

857
01:04:39,440 --> 01:04:41,573
-You're going home?
-I don't have a home anymore,

858
01:04:41,616 --> 01:04:44,054
in case you forgot,
there's nothing left there

859
01:04:44,097 --> 01:04:46,012
but a parking lot
full of dirty drawers

860
01:04:46,056 --> 01:04:48,232
and burnt up girlie magazines
I've been hiding from my wife.

861
01:04:48,275 --> 01:04:51,452
[cellphone rings]

862
01:04:51,496 --> 01:04:54,151
-Broughten.
-It's Shannon.

863
01:04:54,194 --> 01:04:57,502
The Sake House.
You know where it is?

864
01:04:57,545 --> 01:04:59,983
Yeah. 13th and Hudson.

865
01:05:00,026 --> 01:05:03,029
Meet me there in 20 minutes.
Unarmed.

866
01:05:04,901 --> 01:05:06,076
He's coming.

867
01:05:10,123 --> 01:05:11,951
Shannon.

868
01:05:11,995 --> 01:05:13,474
Yeah.

869
01:05:13,518 --> 01:05:15,824
So I guess this means
I'm still in.

870
01:05:15,868 --> 01:05:17,609
Well, I guess this means
you don't blame me

871
01:05:17,652 --> 01:05:19,219
when you take a bullet.

872
01:05:19,263 --> 01:05:21,569
Sound like my mother
at the family reunion.

873
01:05:37,498 --> 01:05:39,152
-You okay?
-Yeah.

874
01:05:44,288 --> 01:05:46,159
-Alex, take Kelly outside.
-Come on.

875
01:05:46,203 --> 01:05:48,901
No, no, no. I want you to listen
to what Vince has to say.

876
01:05:48,945 --> 01:05:51,643
-Alex, take her outside, please.
-What's the matter, Scott?

877
01:05:51,686 --> 01:05:53,819
You can't sit down
and have a drink with a friend.

878
01:05:53,862 --> 01:05:56,648
All my friends are dead, Vince.

879
01:05:56,691 --> 01:05:58,824
They weren't your friend.

880
01:05:58,867 --> 01:06:01,870
Those people sent us over there
to die for a greater glory

881
01:06:01,914 --> 01:06:04,961
of a new world order.

882
01:06:05,004 --> 01:06:07,311
All the proof is on this disk.

883
01:06:09,356 --> 01:06:12,664
Scott, please, just listen
to what he has to say.

884
01:06:12,707 --> 01:06:15,275
Okay? Come on. Sit down.
Come on.

885
01:06:20,019 --> 01:06:22,456
I thought you two
were in on it,

886
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:24,458
but the late general
set me straight.

887
01:06:24,502 --> 01:06:28,027
Set you straight? Negro,
you blew up my fucking house!

888
01:06:28,071 --> 01:06:29,768
[punch lands]

889
01:06:29,811 --> 01:06:31,552
I made a mistake.

890
01:06:34,077 --> 01:06:36,644
It happens when you have to sort
through the kind of lies

891
01:06:36,688 --> 01:06:38,516
that can kill people.

892
01:06:38,559 --> 01:06:40,822
Now I have
to pick up the pieces.

893
01:06:40,866 --> 01:06:42,737
Vince, what are you talking
about?

894
01:06:42,781 --> 01:06:44,130
I'm talking about
saving your life.

895
01:06:44,174 --> 01:06:46,785
These people want you dead too.

896
01:06:46,828 --> 01:06:48,917
You guys need to disappear,

897
01:06:48,961 --> 01:06:51,311
and there's a million tax-free
dollars in it for you

898
01:06:51,355 --> 01:06:53,139
if you do it now.

899
01:06:53,183 --> 01:06:56,577
And just stay out of my way
until this is over.

900
01:06:56,621 --> 01:06:58,971
I can't do it.

901
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:02,366
I'm still a ranger.

902
01:07:02,409 --> 01:07:04,455
And you always will be, Scotty.

903
01:07:06,892 --> 01:07:08,937
Alex?

904
01:07:08,981 --> 01:07:13,464
I mean, $1,000,000 could help me
get my house back, but...

905
01:07:13,507 --> 01:07:14,856
I'm with him.

906
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:17,903
Shit.

907
01:07:17,946 --> 01:07:20,340
Okay, let's go outside.

908
01:07:20,384 --> 01:07:22,995
I could at least tell you
what I know up till now.

909
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:25,302
There's five players in
this game:

910
01:07:25,345 --> 01:07:29,610
Dell, Smith, Haddad,
Rogoff, and one more.

911
01:07:39,011 --> 01:07:40,708
Sure he's in there?

912
01:07:40,752 --> 01:07:42,449
He's in there.

913
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:02,252
That's him.

914
01:08:02,295 --> 01:08:03,818
Let's take him.

915
01:08:07,431 --> 01:08:08,388
[gunshots]

916
01:08:36,808 --> 01:08:39,115
-You okay?
-Yeah.

917
01:08:39,158 --> 01:08:40,899
What the hell didn't
you shoot him?

918
01:08:40,942 --> 01:08:43,031
Because he told us to come
unarmed, asshole.

919
01:08:43,075 --> 01:08:44,990
-Weren't you listening?
-Report, Lieutenant!

920
01:08:45,033 --> 01:08:48,211
Man, you ain't talking to me.
I'm still on leave.

921
01:08:48,254 --> 01:08:50,865
Dude.

922
01:08:50,909 --> 01:08:52,780
Fuck.

923
01:08:52,824 --> 01:08:54,347
Kenner, he called you asshole.

924
01:08:54,391 --> 01:08:57,437
[music playing]

925
01:09:13,540 --> 01:09:15,238
Got it.

926
01:09:19,285 --> 01:09:21,896
-You know where Haddad is held?
-The money first.

927
01:09:21,940 --> 01:09:23,507
Transferred once my troops
are onshore

928
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:26,292
and after you tell me
where Haddad is held.

929
01:09:34,300 --> 01:09:36,955
Okay.

930
01:09:36,998 --> 01:09:40,132
You land your troops right here
just above Daytona.

931
01:09:40,176 --> 01:09:43,309
Quiet beach, rarely used.

932
01:09:43,353 --> 01:09:45,442
I have the trucks waiting.

933
01:09:45,485 --> 01:09:46,921
This is good news.

934
01:09:46,965 --> 01:09:49,359
Very good news.

935
01:09:49,402 --> 01:09:53,145
I wish you were an idealist.

936
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:55,191
Listen...

937
01:09:55,234 --> 01:09:58,585
We played each other real well,
so let's just leave it at that.

938
01:09:58,629 --> 01:10:01,414
Besides, I'm a madman.

939
01:10:01,458 --> 01:10:03,851
You said so yourself.

940
01:10:03,895 --> 01:10:05,070
Yes, I did.

941
01:10:17,909 --> 01:10:19,693
So what the hell did
Shannon tell you?

942
01:10:19,737 --> 01:10:21,347
Look, he tried to buy us off,
okay?

943
01:10:21,391 --> 01:10:23,654
But I don't
accept personal checks.

944
01:10:23,697 --> 01:10:26,178
-Nothing else?
-No, nothing else. Why?

945
01:10:26,222 --> 01:10:27,919
Because I got an email
from Shannon tonight,

946
01:10:27,962 --> 01:10:29,921
and he knows we've sent Haddad
down to Atlanta.

947
01:10:29,964 --> 01:10:33,011
And Atlanta is an unsecured stop
on the loop.

948
01:10:33,054 --> 01:10:36,449
No, not Shannon. I know him.
He's trying to warn us.

949
01:10:38,712 --> 01:10:41,889
Jakar, the landing is
tomorrow night.

950
01:10:41,933 --> 01:10:44,936
Copy that. We're 12 hours
from the U.S. coast.

951
01:10:44,979 --> 01:10:48,069
Stand by for coordinates.

952
01:10:48,113 --> 01:10:50,246
Grid 405.

953
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:53,727
Section G-six.

954
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:05,957
Come on. It's time to go.

955
01:11:06,784 --> 01:11:09,656
I'm afraid.

956
01:11:09,700 --> 01:11:11,441
Well, if Shannon's right,
they're not going to try

957
01:11:11,484 --> 01:11:14,531
anything until after this
is over, so...

958
01:11:14,574 --> 01:11:16,489
You'll be safe at your mom's.

959
01:11:19,187 --> 01:11:21,059
Hey...

960
01:11:21,102 --> 01:11:23,409
Forgot to show you this.

961
01:11:34,115 --> 01:11:37,336
A resignation letter.

962
01:11:37,380 --> 01:11:39,730
I hope you find the time to send
it some day.

963
01:11:39,773 --> 01:11:42,341
I already did.

964
01:11:42,385 --> 01:11:45,301
It's effective
two weeks from today.

965
01:11:45,344 --> 01:11:46,476
Oh!

966
01:11:49,740 --> 01:11:51,698
Any regrets?

967
01:11:51,742 --> 01:11:55,876
Yeah -- that I waited so long
to send it.

968
01:12:23,121 --> 01:12:24,992
<i>[man] Your attention, please.</i>

969
01:12:25,036 --> 01:12:26,777
<i>We need all streets cleared</i>

970
01:12:26,820 --> 01:12:29,257
<i>between Peachtree and Broadway.</i>

971
01:12:29,301 --> 01:12:33,392
<i>All streets cleared between</i><i>
Peachtree and Broadway.</i>

972
01:12:33,436 --> 01:12:35,916
Well, drop more leaflets
if you have to,

973
01:12:35,960 --> 01:12:38,832
I want a four block radius
cleared by sunset,

974
01:12:38,876 --> 01:12:40,617
clear the killing field.

975
01:12:40,660 --> 01:12:42,488
-Where's Haddad?
-He's in a holding cell

976
01:12:42,532 --> 01:12:44,925
-downstairs under heavy guard.
-Whaddya mean, downstairs?

977
01:12:44,969 --> 01:12:46,753
Kenner, the guy doesn't need to
be here.

978
01:12:46,797 --> 01:12:48,364
They just need
to think he's here.

979
01:12:48,407 --> 01:12:50,104
Shannon is still into
our mainframe.

980
01:12:50,148 --> 01:12:51,715
If we pull him out now,
they'll know about it

981
01:12:51,758 --> 01:12:53,717
and they won't come.

982
01:12:53,760 --> 01:12:55,109
What're we telling the networks?

983
01:12:55,153 --> 01:12:56,720
We're playing this
as a bomb scare.

984
01:12:56,763 --> 01:12:59,157
Oh, nice and neat, huh?

985
01:12:59,200 --> 01:13:00,506
Always tell the truth.

986
01:13:00,550 --> 01:13:02,290
It's the best kind of lie.

987
01:13:07,687 --> 01:13:10,037
You see them?

988
01:13:10,081 --> 01:13:12,518
They're coming.

989
01:13:12,562 --> 01:13:13,911
[fires flare]

990
01:13:21,005 --> 01:13:24,574
-You feel the excitement?
-Yeah.

991
01:13:34,061 --> 01:13:36,499
[indistinct shouting]

992
01:14:10,271 --> 01:14:13,057
You too, can learn
how to drive the big rigs.

993
01:14:18,802 --> 01:14:20,630
Damn!
Looks like we got ourselves

994
01:14:20,673 --> 01:14:22,893
a monster truck
rally going out there.

995
01:14:27,201 --> 01:14:28,986
What's the status?

996
01:14:29,029 --> 01:14:31,815
Sat recon just confirmed
that a large truck convoy

997
01:14:31,858 --> 01:14:34,252
just passed
the Jonesborough interchange?

998
01:14:34,295 --> 01:14:36,210
Look, while we just sent
an airstrike,

999
01:14:36,254 --> 01:14:38,778
torch 'em on the ground and have
barbecued terrorists

1000
01:14:38,822 --> 01:14:40,432
for dinner tonight?

1001
01:14:40,476 --> 01:14:42,086
Yeah, that's a nice thought,
Alex.

1002
01:14:42,129 --> 01:14:44,175
I tell you what, why don't we go
with trying to trap them

1003
01:14:44,218 --> 01:14:46,220
in a confined space,
though, huh?

1004
01:14:46,264 --> 01:14:48,614
That might be a little safer
for everybody, don't you think?

1005
01:14:48,658 --> 01:14:50,790
Man, if you say so.
I want to burn people.

1006
01:15:06,240 --> 01:15:09,156
Man, these guys are hauling
and heading right for us.

1007
01:15:09,200 --> 01:15:10,331
I'll check in.

1008
01:15:14,684 --> 01:15:16,250
Give me Central Command.

1009
01:15:27,653 --> 01:15:29,220
Let's go!

1010
01:15:43,277 --> 01:15:44,844
Get the trucks! Hurry!

1011
01:15:44,888 --> 01:15:46,019
Hurry, move quickly.

1012
01:15:58,466 --> 01:16:00,599
Very efficient work.

1013
01:16:00,643 --> 01:16:03,863
-Yeah, $5 million worth.
-Let's go.

1014
01:16:24,841 --> 01:16:27,800
Yeah. Right.

1015
01:16:27,844 --> 01:16:29,497
Just a few blocks now.

1016
01:16:29,541 --> 01:16:32,588
Alright, Alex, you tell 'em one
more time,

1017
01:16:32,631 --> 01:16:34,807
token resistance only,
they fire a few warning shots,

1018
01:16:34,851 --> 01:16:36,766
-they get the hell out of there.
-You got it, Captain.

1019
01:16:45,426 --> 01:16:49,692
Steady.
Now!

1020
01:16:49,735 --> 01:16:51,476
Commence fire!
Commence fire now!

1021
01:17:16,893 --> 01:17:19,330
It seems they were
expecting us.

1022
01:17:19,373 --> 01:17:22,942
They probably picked us up
on satellite. Don't worry.

1023
01:17:22,986 --> 01:17:25,989
They haven't had enough time
to mount any kind of defense.

1024
01:17:26,032 --> 01:17:28,121
For your sake I hope so.

1025
01:17:54,713 --> 01:17:58,282
[indistinct shouting]

1026
01:17:58,325 --> 01:18:00,066
Now go! In the building!

1027
01:18:00,110 --> 01:18:01,720
Go!

1028
01:18:10,468 --> 01:18:12,165
Just outside.

1029
01:18:12,209 --> 01:18:13,253
Get ground team out of there.

1030
01:18:13,297 --> 01:18:14,733
Pull out. Pull out now.

1031
01:18:17,562 --> 01:18:19,520
They're coming up here,
it's time to split.

1032
01:18:19,564 --> 01:18:21,174
We're picking up a chopper.

1033
01:18:21,218 --> 01:18:23,046
All right, that's enough.

1034
01:18:23,089 --> 01:18:25,483
Kenner, you call in
that main strike force.

1035
01:18:25,526 --> 01:18:27,790
-Let's go.
-Sounds like a plan to me.

1036
01:18:36,712 --> 01:18:38,801
Take us down for final approach.

1037
01:18:49,115 --> 01:18:51,204
[gunfire]

1038
01:19:08,874 --> 01:19:11,398
Move in main force.
Move in main force.

1039
01:19:48,522 --> 01:19:51,482
It's a trap!
Get out! Get out!

1040
01:20:12,503 --> 01:20:15,245
<i>Put down your weapons</i><i>
immediately</i>

1041
01:20:15,288 --> 01:20:17,943
<i>or we will be forced to</i><i>
open fire.</i>

1042
01:20:17,987 --> 01:20:21,077
<i>You have 10 seconds to put</i><i>
down your weapons.</i>

1043
01:20:23,166 --> 01:20:25,821
<i>Five seconds, four,</i>

1044
01:20:25,864 --> 01:20:28,214
<i>three, two, one.</i>

1045
01:20:28,258 --> 01:20:31,739
[gunfire]

1046
01:20:43,273 --> 01:20:45,623
-Sounds like a war outside.
-It's the last remnants

1047
01:20:45,666 --> 01:20:48,931
of a National Guard force.
They haven't got a chance.

1048
01:21:09,952 --> 01:21:13,390
Where are all the agents?
The guards?

1049
01:21:13,433 --> 01:21:15,653
Now, just what the hell does
a general evacuation

1050
01:21:15,696 --> 01:21:17,568
mean to you, Colonel?

1051
01:21:17,611 --> 01:21:20,136
-They had a little warning.
-They will have taken Haddad.

1052
01:21:20,179 --> 01:21:21,528
Maybe.

1053
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:55,780
Those are your friends
outside, right?

1054
01:21:57,651 --> 01:22:01,307
The only thing I have to tell
you is I have nothing to say.

1055
01:22:01,351 --> 01:22:03,266
Alright.

1056
01:22:17,541 --> 01:22:19,369
Yo, my man. Do me a favor.

1057
01:22:21,588 --> 01:22:23,982
Tell Elvis I said hey.

1058
01:22:33,209 --> 01:22:36,864
Whoo!
[humming]

1059
01:22:38,040 --> 01:22:40,564
-Thank you very much!
-What is that?

1060
01:22:40,607 --> 01:22:42,479
I don't know.
But I got money to spend,

1061
01:22:42,522 --> 01:22:46,135
so don't hold me up --
Haddad's just up ahead.

1062
01:22:46,178 --> 01:22:48,833
-If you betray me...
-Take a pill.

1063
01:23:30,788 --> 01:23:33,356
Short man, Mr. Spock, follow me.

1064
01:23:42,495 --> 01:23:44,149
-Finish your work upstairs?
-All me, baby.

1065
01:23:44,193 --> 01:23:45,716
-They're not going anywhere.
-I got 'em.

1066
01:23:45,759 --> 01:23:47,239
-They're near the holding cells.
-You sure?

1067
01:23:47,283 --> 01:23:48,893
-Uh-huh.
-All right, let's move.

1068
01:24:03,125 --> 01:24:04,952
Please allow me to express
my apologies

1069
01:24:04,996 --> 01:24:07,346
for any inconveniences
you may have suffered, sir.

1070
01:24:07,390 --> 01:24:09,914
No inconvenience.
My men will kill you.

1071
01:24:09,957 --> 01:24:11,524
Indeed we will.

1072
01:24:26,278 --> 01:24:30,195
Hang on, Colonel. How do you
expect to get out of here alive?

1073
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:33,068
You're losing the war outside.

1074
01:24:33,111 --> 01:24:34,895
I suspected as much.

1075
01:24:34,939 --> 01:24:37,289
-Continue.
-I want you to take Haddad

1076
01:24:37,333 --> 01:24:39,074
out safely --
we don't want him here.

1077
01:24:39,117 --> 01:24:41,337
Shannon's Rangers were supposed
to die in your backyard,

1078
01:24:41,380 --> 01:24:43,991
-Haddad, remember?
-That was our arrangement

1079
01:24:44,035 --> 01:24:45,950
until you betrayed us.

1080
01:24:45,993 --> 01:24:48,213
I just killed two of my men
for you.

1081
01:24:48,257 --> 01:24:50,781
Now, we all want you in power.
Haddad, it was a mistake.

1082
01:24:50,824 --> 01:24:54,698
I've heard what I came for.
You getting any of this, Scott?

1083
01:24:54,741 --> 01:24:56,917
I got it all, Vince.

1084
01:24:56,961 --> 01:25:00,138
There's our fifth player.

1085
01:25:00,182 --> 01:25:02,619
-That's right.
-All right, so let him go,

1086
01:25:02,662 --> 01:25:05,752
buddy, we got enough
to put him away for life.

1087
01:25:05,796 --> 01:25:08,320
It's not just me.
It's Bradford.

1088
01:25:08,364 --> 01:25:09,843
Senator Bradford?!

1089
01:25:09,887 --> 01:25:12,629
You know what he's talking
about?

1090
01:25:12,672 --> 01:25:16,763
Kenner, that's bullshit!
He's investigating you!

1091
01:25:16,807 --> 01:25:19,549
Investigation -- Christ,
Bradford's running

1092
01:25:19,592 --> 01:25:21,290
the entire operation.

1093
01:25:21,333 --> 01:25:23,422
He has oil interests
in Haddad's country.

1094
01:25:23,466 --> 01:25:25,685
He wants Haddad back there
as bad as we do.

1095
01:25:25,729 --> 01:25:28,993
They played us like cards,
Scott.

1096
01:25:29,036 --> 01:25:32,997
Nothing matters to them as long
as they keep the game going.

1097
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:35,521
Yeah, 'cause the game is
all that matters.

1098
01:25:54,105 --> 01:25:57,543
You finish up here,
I'm going after Shannon.

1099
01:26:59,910 --> 01:27:03,218
All right, Goddamn it.
Let's get this shit over with.

1100
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:22,933
Woo! 4.5 seconds.
A new ghetto record.

1101
01:27:22,976 --> 01:27:26,110
Now let me see your fucking
hands, bee-otch!

1102
01:28:09,284 --> 01:28:12,156
All right, Vince!
That's enough! Drop the gun!

1103
01:28:12,199 --> 01:28:15,377
It's too late for that.
I've done too much.

1104
01:28:15,420 --> 01:28:17,814
Somebody is going to have
to take the fall for this.

1105
01:28:17,857 --> 01:28:20,512
-We got Kenner!
-That's bullshit!

1106
01:28:20,556 --> 01:28:22,384
You know
it won't happen like that.

1107
01:28:22,427 --> 01:28:24,255
I'm getting
the hell out of here.

1108
01:28:24,299 --> 01:28:25,909
I can't let you do that.

1109
01:28:25,952 --> 01:28:27,737
I guess you can't.

1110
01:28:51,848 --> 01:28:54,416
Hey, man, you can't take
that bus!

1111
01:29:31,235 --> 01:29:32,932
Out! Move!

1112
01:31:27,612 --> 01:31:29,179
Don't do this, Scott.

1113
01:31:29,222 --> 01:31:32,182
Get outta the way!

1114
01:31:32,225 --> 01:31:35,707
Alright, Vince. I call.

1115
01:31:45,848 --> 01:31:48,981
Come on, Scott!
Fold your hand!

1116
01:31:49,025 --> 01:31:50,983
Don't make me kill you!

1117
01:31:51,027 --> 01:31:52,202
I'm out!

1118
01:31:52,245 --> 01:31:54,247
[tires squealing]

1119
01:32:00,689 --> 01:32:01,864

[groaning]

1121
01:33:21,378 --> 01:33:25,295
I hate to leave loaded guns
lying around.

1122
01:33:25,338 --> 01:33:28,124
You didn't have to take it
this far, Vince.

1123
01:33:31,562 --> 01:33:33,259
I'm okay.

1124
01:33:35,610 --> 01:33:37,481
I'm okay.

1125
01:33:39,396 --> 01:33:41,920
Was a big game.

1126
01:33:41,964 --> 01:33:44,314
I had to stay in it.

1127
01:33:44,357 --> 01:33:48,013
I wanted the bad guys,
the girl and the money.

1128
01:33:48,057 --> 01:33:51,321
You got the bad guys.

1129
01:33:51,364 --> 01:33:53,323
You got the girl.

1130
01:34:08,381 --> 01:34:09,948
Bank card.

1131
01:34:09,992 --> 01:34:12,603
[music playing]

1132
01:34:17,129 --> 01:34:18,696
[wheezing]

1133
01:34:43,982 --> 01:34:46,289
Hello, Senator.

1134
01:34:46,332 --> 01:34:49,335
Hi, Scott.

1135
01:34:49,379 --> 01:34:50,815
How's your wife?

1136
01:34:50,859 --> 01:34:52,687
My wife is fine.
Thank you, sir.

1137
01:34:52,730 --> 01:34:55,428
Good.

1138
01:34:55,472 --> 01:34:57,735
Hell of a set to down there in
Atlanta, huh?

1139
01:34:57,779 --> 01:35:01,608
It's a pity we lost Shannon.

1140
01:35:01,652 --> 01:35:03,610
I guess it had to be.

1141
01:35:03,654 --> 01:35:06,135
That's too bad.

1142
01:35:06,178 --> 01:35:08,180
Evidence died with him.

1143
01:35:08,224 --> 01:35:10,530
Could have had those bastards.

1144
01:35:12,576 --> 01:35:15,840
I don't suppose you'd change
your mind

1145
01:35:15,884 --> 01:35:18,190
about coming in to testify?

1146
01:35:18,234 --> 01:35:20,889
Well, as a matter of fact,
I already have, sir.

1147
01:35:43,650 --> 01:35:47,219
Tell me I'm not dreaming,
Scott, are we really here?

1148
01:35:47,263 --> 01:35:50,919
This beautiful beach resort away
from everything.

1149
01:35:50,962 --> 01:35:53,835
Just you and I.

1150
01:35:53,878 --> 01:35:56,925
Kel, I think we made it.

1151
01:35:56,968 --> 01:35:59,318
What cost,
though, I'm still not sure.

1152
01:36:02,713 --> 01:36:04,759
Oh, here.

1153
01:36:04,802 --> 01:36:07,587
Thank you very much.
Now, hold on.

1154
01:36:09,807 --> 01:36:11,504
Thank you.

1155
01:36:19,382 --> 01:36:20,949
To Vince.

1156
01:36:22,385 --> 01:36:23,908
I agree.

1157
01:36:26,606 --> 01:36:29,305
To Vince.
