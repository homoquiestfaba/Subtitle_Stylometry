1
00:02:54,883 --> 00:02:57,135
Morning Jose! How are you doing?

2
00:02:57,135 --> 00:02:59,304
Good morning Mr. Abraham! How are you?

3
00:02:59,345 --> 00:03:02,765
I'm good, lose the whole mister thing,

4
00:03:02,807 --> 00:03:04,851
you wouldn't have called me that a month ago.

5
00:03:04,893 --> 00:03:06,978
A month ago you were just Jake.

6
00:03:07,020 --> 00:03:10,940
I still am: save the Mister Abraham for my father.

7
00:03:10,982 --> 00:03:12,483
- Alright --Alright

8
00:03:12,525 --> 00:03:14,485
Hey, we still on for lunch?

9
00:03:14,527 --> 00:03:16,487
Of course, wouldn't miss it for anything!

10
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:20,033
Okay we'll uh- see you in about an hour.

11
00:03:20,074 --> 00:03:21,326
Sounds good!

12
00:03:28,541 --> 00:03:30,793
[Jose Narrating] I've never seen such a change.

13
00:03:30,835 --> 00:03:32,879
Jake Abraham wasn't always this way

14
00:03:32,921 --> 00:03:37,800
His brother Seth, well... he was born good from his mothers womb

15
00:03:37,842 --> 00:03:42,889
But Jake..
Jake grew up with a chip on his shoulder as bigger as a Sierra Madres

16
00:03:44,766 --> 00:03:47,185
It wasn't that long ago when it blew up.

17
00:03:50,563 --> 00:03:51,981
They're not doing much out there..

18
00:03:52,023 --> 00:03:53,483
Well, we had a glitch-

19
00:03:53,524 --> 00:03:55,860
They're just standing around, it's frustrating!

20
00:03:55,902 --> 00:04:00,198
Just take them some waters, tell them to relax,
we'll get this thing sorted out, okay?

21
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,492
Alright.

22
00:04:02,533 --> 00:04:04,619
HAS ANYBODY SEEN JAKE?

23
00:04:17,715 --> 00:04:21,678
Ooh, I would hide if I were you..

24
00:04:21,719 --> 00:04:25,765
.. your brother has been looking for you, he's in one of his moods.

25
00:04:25,807 --> 00:04:30,061
Ah, that's a shock.. I'll be in here.

26
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:40,071
..shoot.

27
00:05:03,261 --> 00:05:06,264
Jake, you changed the invoicing program.

28
00:05:06,264 --> 00:05:08,474
Yeah, I told you I was going to.

29
00:05:08,516 --> 00:05:11,436
You did it even though I asked you not to.

30
00:05:11,436 --> 00:05:14,605
I know, and now we have a more efficient system.

31
00:05:14,605 --> 00:05:15,857
That's unacceptable.

32
00:05:17,442 --> 00:05:22,530
Okay, what do you want to do, dad, do you want to fire me?

33
00:05:23,781 --> 00:05:28,328
We aren't selling widgets, Jake,
we're selling the best grains and produce in the state..

34
00:05:28,369 --> 00:05:30,955
..and this program you brought in-

35
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:35,001
The new program is faster than the older one, so what's the problem?

36
00:05:35,043 --> 00:05:37,086
No one knows how to use it..

37
00:05:37,128 --> 00:05:40,798
..so we missed another order this morning
because you haven't properly trained-

38
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,136
Do you expect me to do everything around here?

39
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:48,973
No.. I just expect you to do your job.

40
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:02,653
Well.. you're up early.

41
00:06:02,653 --> 00:06:05,281
You've got to be kidding me, Mrs. Grey?

42
00:06:05,323 --> 00:06:07,367
Why did you let him in?

43
00:06:07,408 --> 00:06:10,244
What's the matter? Somebody not doing their job?

44
00:06:11,996 --> 00:06:15,666
If you're here to chastise me, dad beat you to it.

45
00:06:15,666 --> 00:06:17,335
You know we didn't get that order in..

46
00:06:17,335 --> 00:06:18,961
I know that.

47
00:06:19,003 --> 00:06:21,547
That means we had guys standing around doing nothing today.

48
00:06:21,589 --> 00:06:23,132
I heard that too..

49
00:06:23,174 --> 00:06:24,717
It costs us money, Jake!

50
00:06:24,759 --> 00:06:26,427
I know.

51
00:06:26,469 --> 00:06:29,055
You know this could have been avoided if
you would have gotten here on time today.

52
00:06:29,097 --> 00:06:33,017
Instead of rolling in late.. hung over.

53
00:06:33,017 --> 00:06:36,396
Great.. anything else?

54
00:06:40,024 --> 00:06:41,526
[mumbles] Pathetic.

55
00:06:53,121 --> 00:06:54,705
I told you to hide.

56
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:57,917
Why don't you ever knock?

57
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:59,043
Why should I?

58
00:07:01,254 --> 00:07:04,924
So you don't give me a heart attack, Mrs. Grey, I tend to day dream and

59
00:07:04,966 --> 00:07:09,011
believe it or you're not your not the girl I'm on the beach with.

60
00:07:09,053 --> 00:07:10,721
I like beaches!

61
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:13,766
Not gonna happen.

62
00:07:13,808 --> 00:07:16,227
Well we've got a problem-

63
00:07:16,269 --> 00:07:21,065
The engine parts for the tractor haven't
arrived and the acreage in the south field is

64
00:07:21,107 --> 00:07:24,694
scheduled for planting when? Tomorrow..

65
00:07:24,735 --> 00:07:30,616
- Okay, um, tell Seth to have the foreman take care off it..

66
00:07:30,658 --> 00:07:33,119
.. delegate some responsibility.

67
00:07:33,161 --> 00:07:36,456
Need I remind you this is something else that could have been avoided

68
00:07:36,497 --> 00:07:39,917
If I had shown up on to work on time, I know..

69
00:07:39,917 --> 00:07:43,254
The rest of us have been here since seven..

70
00:07:46,924 --> 00:07:49,635
Forget it.. call Benward, order the parts.

71
00:07:49,677 --> 00:07:51,387
No, Benward? No!

72
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:54,557
Yeah, if we go with Benward we can get the engine fixed today.

73
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:58,102
They use cheap materials, it won't even last one season!

74
00:07:58,144 --> 00:08:04,442
Well, you know,
it's either that or we leave a field full of workers doing nothing all day.

75
00:08:04,442 --> 00:08:05,776
Seth won't like that-

76
00:08:05,776 --> 00:08:08,488
I don't care what Seth thinks, just do it.

77
00:08:10,865 --> 00:08:12,450
Ah, someone's testy...

78
00:08:23,294 --> 00:08:25,463
[Jake] Hey. [Mr Abraham] Hey.

79
00:08:27,298 --> 00:08:30,259
So, have you thought anymore about our conversation yesterday?

80
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:32,094
Which one?

81
00:08:32,136 --> 00:08:33,971
About the extra vacation week?

82
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,474
Ahh...

83
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:42,688
I just thought it was only fair,
I've been working in these fields since I was five-

84
00:08:42,730 --> 00:08:47,235
- You're always devising ways to get away from here.. why is that?

85
00:08:49,487 --> 00:08:53,616
It's nothing to do with you dad, I just...

86
00:08:53,658 --> 00:08:56,327
.. this isn't my life.

87
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:59,038
- Well, what is your life?

88
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:05,711
I don't know.. something more interesting than vegetables.

89
00:09:05,753 --> 00:09:08,714
You know farming is not glamorous.. I give you that.

90
00:09:08,756 --> 00:09:12,343
But it's noble work we do, and it's necessary

91
00:09:12,343 --> 00:09:18,349
Yeah I know,
and I know that it's your dream to have me stay and work on this farm,

92
00:09:18,391 --> 00:09:21,561
but it's not mine.

93
00:09:21,602 --> 00:09:25,982
And for once I would love to be able to go
out and have a good time and not come

94
00:09:26,023 --> 00:09:31,028
back home and expect a sermon, you know?

95
00:09:31,070 --> 00:09:33,990
I'm not expecting you to be perfect, you know?

96
00:09:34,031 --> 00:09:37,201
--I'm so glad you found time to take a break from your busy day.

97
00:09:41,706 --> 00:09:43,416
Oops..

98
00:09:43,457 --> 00:09:45,835
You're coming with me today to talk to the customers.

99
00:09:45,876 --> 00:09:47,169
Why?

100
00:09:47,211 --> 00:09:49,672
Because they're going to be mad, and I'm tired of covering for you.

101
00:09:49,714 --> 00:09:53,217
Oh, well I don't deal with customers, so too bad.

102
00:09:53,217 --> 00:09:55,553
Then what is it that you DO here?

103
00:09:55,595 --> 00:09:58,180
You know what Seth? I wouldn't expect you to

104
00:09:58,222 --> 00:10:00,850
understand what I do, especially since you never

105
00:10:00,891 --> 00:10:03,227
Never what?

106
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:04,729
.. Nothing.

107
00:10:04,729 --> 00:10:06,564
No, come on, PLEASE say it.

108
00:10:06,606 --> 00:10:10,276
Huh? Never what? Never went to college?
No, I had to stay here and work.

109
00:10:10,318 --> 00:10:14,572
I didn't have the luxury of wasting time
hanging out at parties and skipping classes

110
00:10:14,614 --> 00:10:15,740
Calm down..

111
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,783
No, you're right, hey Seth, THANK YOU!

112
00:10:17,825 --> 00:10:21,954
Thank you SO MUCH for sticking around,
because we all know how hard it is to find

113
00:10:21,996 --> 00:10:23,914
someone who can drive a TRACTOR.

114
00:10:24,415 --> 00:10:25,249
[Mr Abraham] SETH!

115
00:10:25,249 --> 00:10:26,917
You're a disgrace to this family!

116
00:10:26,917 --> 00:10:28,753
Admit it, you're jealous! -Yeah!?

117
00:10:28,753 --> 00:10:30,921
Yeah, you always have been!

118
00:10:30,921 --> 00:10:33,591
- Is that it?!? COME ON! SHOW ME HOW JEALOUS I AM!
- SAY IT! I WANT YOU TO SAY IT!

119
00:10:33,633 --> 00:10:34,675
STOP!

120
00:10:42,266 --> 00:10:43,851
.. Just go..

121
00:10:44,935 --> 00:10:47,438
..What are you waiting for? Just leave!

122
00:10:47,480 --> 00:10:50,816
Make our lives easier and just get out!

123
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:12,797
I'm sorry Seth, I didn't know that was yours..

124
00:11:12,838 --> 00:11:14,674
.. Don't worry about it.

125
00:11:24,975 --> 00:11:27,478
You okay?

126
00:11:27,478 --> 00:11:30,356
Yeah, I'm fine..

127
00:11:30,398 --> 00:11:33,317
I switched back to the old invoicing program.

128
00:11:38,823 --> 00:11:42,702
You know Seth, got that hot temper..

129
00:11:42,743 --> 00:11:44,495
Yeah..

130
00:11:44,537 --> 00:11:46,664
You know, he's got a point though..

131
00:11:48,999 --> 00:11:52,503
..I don't know what I'm still doing here.

132
00:11:54,422 --> 00:11:57,007
What do you mean?

133
00:11:57,007 --> 00:11:58,843
I mean I want to leave.

134
00:12:02,930 --> 00:12:04,181
You can't just do that..

135
00:12:04,223 --> 00:12:09,520
Yeah, I can, and I want to, I mean, I...

136
00:12:09,562 --> 00:12:13,357
I need to live my life and I'm not doing that here..

137
00:12:16,193 --> 00:12:18,070
I quit, dad..

138
00:12:20,364 --> 00:12:25,369
..and since I'm quitting,
maybe we should talk about a severance package.

139
00:12:28,914 --> 00:12:31,542
It usually doesn't work that way..

140
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:36,464
Well, then I need some money to get started.. make some investments.

141
00:12:38,799 --> 00:12:40,885
How much are you asking for?

142
00:12:43,554 --> 00:12:46,056
What about my inheritance?

143
00:12:46,056 --> 00:12:50,561
I take that now and I could double it or
more by the time I would have received it.

144
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,316
.. I'd have to think on it.

145
00:12:58,235 --> 00:12:59,236
Okay..

146
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:06,035
.. Think about it and let me know.

147
00:13:06,076 --> 00:13:11,582
Cause either way, I'm gone as soon as I get my stuff together.

148
00:13:38,192 --> 00:13:40,778
Mrs. Grey..

149
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:44,448
.. Would you get Mr. Ferris on the phone for me?

150
00:13:44,448 --> 00:13:46,116
I'll take it in my office.

151
00:13:46,784 --> 00:13:49,453
Sure.. will do.

152
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,425
So how's Seth doing? How are his roses?

153
00:14:03,467 --> 00:14:05,845
The garden is beautiful.

154
00:14:05,886 --> 00:14:08,347
- Hey Mr Ferris.

155
00:14:08,389 --> 00:14:09,974
Jake! Haven't seen you in a long time.

156
00:14:10,015 --> 00:14:11,976
Yeah, it's been a while

157
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,813
So, uh.. so how's this all work?

158
00:14:15,813 --> 00:14:18,440
Well, there's a few steps we have to take..

159
00:14:18,482 --> 00:14:20,317
.. Well how many steps can there be?

160
00:14:25,489 --> 00:14:29,285
Down at the bottom of the page here is what
your going to be receiving as your share

161
00:14:29,326 --> 00:14:32,204
of the inheritance, you're going get it all in one check,

162
00:14:32,246 --> 00:14:35,416
but there is some paper work we have to do to finalize all of this.

163
00:14:36,417 --> 00:14:38,836
Well, are you sure you want to do this?

164
00:14:38,878 --> 00:14:42,339
Yes, yeah, I told you I was.

165
00:14:42,339 --> 00:14:47,303
Okay, I'm your father, you know? I love you,
I want to make sure you're alright.

166
00:14:47,344 --> 00:14:52,641
I'm fine, okay? I'm an adult, I can take care of myself.

167
00:14:52,683 --> 00:14:54,268
Alright.

168
00:14:56,520 --> 00:14:59,315
Mr. Ferris, go ahead and draw up the papers.

169
00:14:59,356 --> 00:15:00,774
They'll be ready first thing in the morning.

170
00:15:12,369 --> 00:15:14,872
There you go. -Thank you, Jake.

171
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:17,291
And this is for you.

172
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:22,296
Thank you, thank you so much.

173
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:30,554
A fool and his money..

174
00:15:38,771 --> 00:15:40,564
Do you know where you're going to live?

175
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:46,570
Not yet.. I'll figure it out.

176
00:15:49,073 --> 00:15:51,742
Here.. take this.

177
00:15:54,244 --> 00:15:55,913
.. This is grandpa's watch.

178
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:58,749
Yeah.. I want you to have it.

179
00:16:01,585 --> 00:16:03,253
Does it even work?

180
00:16:03,253 --> 00:16:05,089
Yeah, it works well.

181
00:16:05,130 --> 00:16:07,508
But um, mostly just uh..

182
00:16:10,928 --> 00:16:14,098
.. just take it.. I want you to have it.

183
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,436
Thanks.

184
00:16:21,438 --> 00:16:24,608
A lot of people are going to miss you, Jake..

185
00:16:24,608 --> 00:16:30,656
A lot of people? Come on dad.. it's better for everyone that I'm going.

186
00:16:30,698 --> 00:16:32,616
You're not doing this for us.

187
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,161
No, you're right.

188
00:16:38,998 --> 00:16:43,502
I should.. I should get going.

189
00:16:43,544 --> 00:16:45,587
Take care buddy.

190
00:16:45,629 --> 00:16:46,964
Thank you.

191
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,632
Alright, drive careful.

192
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:16,368
[Radio DJ 1] I'm Andy Greenberg,
and I'm going to change the way you think.

193
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:20,956
You know how often you have read,
and people have told you, "Believe In Yourself"

194
00:17:20,998 --> 00:17:23,667
That's right, you tell it to people, people tell it to you,

195
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:26,712
But you know what? That's absolutely WRONG, I-

196
00:17:26,754 --> 00:17:30,632
[Radio DJ 2] -It used to be that a man's word was his bond;
but in the city?

197
00:17:30,674 --> 00:17:33,969
I mean, it's still that way in the rural areas, but in the cities?

198
00:17:34,011 --> 00:17:36,013
You better watch out for the sharks!

199
00:17:36,013 --> 00:17:40,476
[Radio DJ 3] As I was saying,
don't let women beguile you; some women use men,

200
00:17:40,517 --> 00:17:43,854
In other words, they can out use their abusers.

201
00:17:43,896 --> 00:17:46,356
[Radio DJ 4] Because if you're obsessed with what someone else has,

202
00:17:46,356 --> 00:17:50,360
instead of with what you have,
you'll never be happy, you'll never be at peace.

203
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:55,741
We all want to connect with other people,
but the great thing about family connections

204
00:17:55,783 --> 00:17:59,578
is they are utterly indestructible, you can't take away the-

205
00:17:59,620 --> 00:18:09,713
[Radio Music]

206
00:20:19,676 --> 00:20:20,552
We've only got in the one..

207
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,889
Yeah, I'll take it.

208
00:20:23,931 --> 00:20:27,351
Excellent! But.. will it go with your new sports car?

209
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:30,479
Which is your favorite out of these here?

210
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:31,730
- My favorite? - Yeah.

211
00:20:35,192 --> 00:20:38,028
This piece here, it's stunning.

212
00:20:38,070 --> 00:20:40,030
If I could, I'd get it for myself.

213
00:20:42,032 --> 00:20:42,783
It is beautiful..

214
00:20:45,702 --> 00:20:47,162
I'll take that as well.

215
00:20:47,204 --> 00:20:50,040
Is it for your wife, or.. girlfriend?

216
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,333
It's for you.

217
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:52,376
For me?

218
00:20:52,417 --> 00:20:53,418
Yeah, for you.

219
00:20:53,460 --> 00:20:54,044
You're joking!

220
00:20:54,086 --> 00:20:55,254
No.

221
00:20:55,295 --> 00:20:56,713
You look like you deserve it..

222
00:20:56,713 --> 00:20:59,258
Oh my gosh..

223
00:22:33,477 --> 00:22:34,644
Who is she?

224
00:22:34,686 --> 00:22:37,147
Oh that's Laura.. she's an actress also.

225
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:38,648
Really?

226
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:42,069
We recently worked together on a film called "A Box for Rob".

227
00:22:59,336 --> 00:23:01,838
And this is Frank.

228
00:23:01,838 --> 00:23:03,632
Good evening.

229
00:23:03,673 --> 00:23:05,884
Frank owns the place, Frank, this is Jake.

230
00:23:05,926 --> 00:23:07,344
Hi, Jake.

231
00:23:07,386 --> 00:23:09,679
- Hey, nice to meet you. -Yeah, pleasure.

232
00:23:09,721 --> 00:23:11,848
- So are you enjoying yourself? -We are.

233
00:23:11,848 --> 00:23:13,433
Well, you should be, you have lovely company.

234
00:23:15,268 --> 00:23:16,186
If I can get you anything, let me know.

235
00:23:16,186 --> 00:23:18,313
Ok, will do.

236
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:21,358
Arial, comp this table.

237
00:23:25,362 --> 00:23:27,614
So, an actress, huh?

238
00:23:30,534 --> 00:23:32,536
You really like her.

239
00:23:32,577 --> 00:23:34,579
Yes, it's obvious.

240
00:23:36,373 --> 00:23:38,667
Cheers ladies-

241
00:23:38,708 --> 00:23:41,169
- to a great night.

242
00:23:41,211 --> 00:23:43,213
Drink up, we need another bottle.

243
00:24:00,730 --> 00:24:02,607
Can I buy you a drink?

244
00:24:02,649 --> 00:24:03,900
Do I know you?

245
00:24:03,900 --> 00:24:07,028
Not yet.. I'm Jake.

246
00:24:07,070 --> 00:24:07,904
Laura.

247
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:11,116
Are you new to the city?

248
00:24:11,158 --> 00:24:13,785
Just moved, actually..

249
00:24:13,827 --> 00:24:15,745
What do you do?

250
00:24:15,787 --> 00:24:17,456
I do lots of things.

251
00:24:17,497 --> 00:24:22,043
Okay, well.. how about your job?

252
00:24:22,085 --> 00:24:25,422
Okay.. I'm an investor.

253
00:24:26,590 --> 00:24:28,300
Stock market?

254
00:24:28,341 --> 00:24:30,760
Amongst other ventures, yeah..

255
00:24:30,760 --> 00:24:31,970
Are you any good?

256
00:24:36,016 --> 00:24:37,142
Thanks.

257
00:24:39,519 --> 00:24:42,606
Where do you live?

258
00:24:42,647 --> 00:24:47,277
Nowhere, yet.. I've been staying at The Lux.

259
00:24:47,319 --> 00:24:48,320
Oh, nice.

260
00:24:50,780 --> 00:24:53,950
Why? You know of anywhere decent?

261
00:24:53,992 --> 00:24:55,494
Do you have a pen?

262
00:25:00,957 --> 00:25:04,753
There's a condo for sale in the building where I live.

263
00:25:04,794 --> 00:25:07,297
Your building? Wow..

264
00:25:07,297 --> 00:25:11,426
That's uhh.. a leap of faith, don't you think?

265
00:25:11,468 --> 00:25:13,011
I could be a serial killer..

266
00:25:13,845 --> 00:25:14,846
.. so could I.

267
00:25:17,140 --> 00:25:18,642
So I hear you're an actress?

268
00:25:18,642 --> 00:25:22,646
[Laughs] What have you heard?

269
00:25:22,646 --> 00:25:26,775
Just that. Been in anything I might have seen?

270
00:25:26,816 --> 00:25:29,152
Probably not, but I will be.

271
00:25:31,905 --> 00:25:32,822
Thanks.

272
00:25:38,995 --> 00:25:40,372
Ciao.

273
00:25:40,413 --> 00:25:42,165
Have a good night.

274
00:25:43,250 --> 00:25:44,417
- Goodnight, Jake. - Goodnight, Frank.

275
00:25:59,683 --> 00:26:02,310
He's gone down the wrong path, Cid..

276
00:26:02,352 --> 00:26:06,189
Abe, trust God.

277
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:15,323
You know, at passover,
we were instructed to smear the blood of a lamb on a door post.

278
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:26,960
But what most people miss,
is that blood was for the whole mishpocha- for the whole family.

279
00:26:29,754 --> 00:26:31,631
Trust God.

280
00:26:36,386 --> 00:26:38,722
When was the last time you heard from your son?

281
00:26:42,892 --> 00:26:44,477
We haven't..

282
00:26:56,406 --> 00:27:00,243
Hi! I see you found your condo, congratulations!

283
00:27:00,243 --> 00:27:02,787
I did, thanks to you.

284
00:27:02,829 --> 00:27:03,788
Now you owe me.

285
00:27:03,830 --> 00:27:04,623
I do.

286
00:27:04,664 --> 00:27:06,249
Big, big, big-big-big..

287
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,584
See, I didn't realize that..

288
00:27:07,626 --> 00:27:09,252
..Huge.

289
00:27:09,252 --> 00:27:10,837
Bye.

290
00:27:45,372 --> 00:27:47,874
Barely had an inch of rain in the last three weeks..

291
00:27:59,219 --> 00:28:01,763

been the financial and the health demise

292

of America, and together,
using the 90 Essential Nutrients, we can save America.

You want a healthy energy drink? We've got a healthy energy drink.

294
00:28:08,478 --> 00:28:10,980
Rebound has a hundred nutrients in it, all the other-

[Sean Hannity] -whirlwind world that you live in,

296
00:28:13,316 --> 00:28:18,321
but now it's time to go home.
Return to your traditional moral values, don't wait any longer!

297
00:28:18,363 --> 00:28:23,201
You've gotta go, ok? Now, when we come back,
we'll be talking with Mark Andrew Olson,

298
00:28:23,243 --> 00:28:26,996
he's the co-author of "Animal Colony", now it's a quick-read allegory

299
00:28:26,996 --> 00:28:32,043
with a phenomenal track record of
transforming liberals into conservatives.

300
00:28:32,085 --> 00:28:34,087
Now that's coming up next, straight ahead.

[Bev Smallwood] You know how it is,
one day you can be on top of the world,

304
00:28:44,514 --> 00:28:47,976
and the next day, the world's on top of you.

305
00:28:48,017 --> 00:28:53,565
I was talking with a man just yesterday,
who had come into a lot of money,

306
00:28:53,606 --> 00:28:58,027
and he didn't know how to treat that money, in fact he flaunted it.

307
00:28:58,069 --> 00:29:03,032
And believe me, he didn't like the results of that. I told him,

308
00:29:03,032 --> 00:29:09,038
"you know, you want women to like you for who you are,
not for what you have".

309
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:13,251
Otherwise, you're going to attract the wrong kind of woman.

310
00:29:54,292 --> 00:29:57,420
Having a hard time figuring out what you want?

311
00:29:57,420 --> 00:30:02,383
Yeah, sorry.. it's my first time in here.

312
00:30:02,425 --> 00:30:05,094
Well, what are you in the mood for?

313
00:30:05,136 --> 00:30:09,265
I don't know.. something with a little style.

314
00:30:11,267 --> 00:30:14,062
What about a Raspberry Mocha?

315
00:30:14,103 --> 00:30:17,440
Yeah, that sounds stylish.

316
00:30:17,440 --> 00:30:21,736
No, how about um.. an espresso romano?

317
00:30:21,778 --> 00:30:22,278
Okay.

318
00:30:23,696 --> 00:30:27,075
So, do you live near by, or just passing through?

319
00:30:27,116 --> 00:30:31,329
Yeah, I bought a place a couple of doors down, the plaza building.

320
00:30:31,371 --> 00:30:32,956
The whole building?

321
00:30:32,997 --> 00:30:36,793
No, no, just one condo.

322
00:30:36,835 --> 00:30:38,628
That will be four fifty.

323
00:30:41,464 --> 00:30:43,800
Uh.. do you need change?

324
00:30:43,800 --> 00:30:47,679
Oh, yeah, sorry, that's all I have.. can you break it?

325
00:30:47,720 --> 00:30:50,431
- Yeah, its fine. - All right, sorry about that.

326
00:30:50,473 --> 00:30:51,975
Oh, do you have wi-fi here?

327
00:30:52,016 --> 00:31:02,360
Yep.. this is the password, and here's your change, Mr. Trump.

328
00:31:02,402 --> 00:31:06,865
You know, Donald is just an alias.. my friends call me Jake.

329
00:31:06,906 --> 00:31:10,827
Well, if any of those friends come in,
I'll have the maître d' escort them to your table.

330
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:12,036
Please do.

331
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:13,997
I'm Summer, I'll be your barista.

332
00:31:43,109 --> 00:31:44,319
.. Mr Trump. [Laughs]

333
00:31:44,360 --> 00:31:45,904
Thank you.

334
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:05,423
Hi!

335
00:32:05,465 --> 00:32:07,216
Hi.

336
00:32:07,216 --> 00:32:12,722
I.. sorry, I just came over to borrow some eggs.

337
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:21,230
Eggs, yeah- some neighbors borrow eggs
from each other from time to time, so..

338
00:32:21,272 --> 00:32:24,609
.. I was going to do that.

339
00:32:24,651 --> 00:32:25,985
When do I get them back?

340
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,740
The eggs? Cause your borrowing them?

341
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:37,914
Yeah, uh.. Okay, I just wanted a excuse to see you.

342
00:32:37,956 --> 00:32:40,249
You need a excuse to see me?

343
00:32:40,249 --> 00:32:42,710
Do you wanna have dinner with me?

344
00:32:42,752 --> 00:32:45,296
Of course she'll have dinner with you.

345
00:32:45,338 --> 00:32:46,589
Welcome to the neighborhood, Jake.

346
00:32:46,589 --> 00:32:48,925
Thank you.

347
00:32:48,925 --> 00:32:54,472
You know, pally, you better get a better game on.. eggs is kinda weak.

348
00:32:54,514 --> 00:32:56,307
Yeah..

349
00:32:56,349 --> 00:32:59,769
- Happy scrambling.. take care babe. - See you, Frank.

350
00:32:59,769 --> 00:33:01,771
Frank..

351
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,064
So.. you want those eggs?

352
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,232
Uh, yeah, eggs..

353
00:33:04,273 --> 00:33:05,441
Yeah, come on.

354
00:33:05,483 --> 00:33:08,653
.. good, okay..

355
00:33:08,695 --> 00:33:11,197
Two.. three.. dozen?

356
00:33:15,284 --> 00:33:18,121
We're gonna take care of you, Sam.

357
00:33:18,121 --> 00:33:23,793
We have a nice severance package.. you've got a lot of skills.

358
00:33:26,963 --> 00:33:31,134
Should be able to find something long before the money runs out.

359
00:33:32,176 --> 00:33:33,344
Thank you.

360
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:37,807
It's gonna work out.

361
00:33:54,323 --> 00:33:55,825
It's been an honor to work for you.

362
00:33:55,867 --> 00:33:57,994
It's been my honor, too.

363
00:34:09,255 --> 00:34:10,798
What's wrong with Sam?

364
00:34:10,840 --> 00:34:13,217
I had to let him go.

365
00:34:13,259 --> 00:34:16,012
We're that bad off?

366
00:34:16,054 --> 00:34:17,513
It's the drought, Seth..

367
00:34:19,682 --> 00:34:22,685
We're producing half as much as we usually do..

368
00:34:35,740 --> 00:34:38,409
[Singing] ♪ The Coffee Shop

369
00:34:38,451 --> 00:34:41,829
♪ You're my one stop shop

370
00:34:41,871 --> 00:34:47,752
♪ I love the Coffee Shop

371
00:34:47,794 --> 00:34:49,879
♪ Yeah!

372
00:34:51,297 --> 00:34:53,216
[Performer] Thanks so much, its been such a fun night,

373
00:34:53,257 --> 00:34:57,220
and my Tribute Cd is available around the counter, thank you.

374
00:35:03,893 --> 00:35:07,188
You know we have live music here?

375
00:35:07,230 --> 00:35:11,067
Hey! Sorry, did you say something, or?

376
00:35:11,067 --> 00:35:14,237
I said we have live music here..

377
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:15,696
Yeah?

378
00:35:15,738 --> 00:35:19,242
The singers, it's kinda what they'e here for..

379
00:35:19,283 --> 00:35:24,914
Right, I see how that might look bad..

380
00:35:24,914 --> 00:35:27,458
.. I wasn't listening to music though.

381
00:35:27,500 --> 00:35:31,254
You were.. playing a video game?

382
00:35:31,254 --> 00:35:32,964
I'm researching..

383
00:35:33,005 --> 00:35:37,927
What? The effect of video violence on impressionable minds?

384
00:35:37,927 --> 00:35:44,559
"Impressionable"?
Pretty sure I moved past "impressionable" a few years ago, thank you.

385
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:48,229
But no, this is a company that I bought stock in,

386
00:35:48,271 --> 00:35:52,650
and they make a lot of these games, apparently make millions off them.

387
00:35:52,692 --> 00:35:54,318
Off of video games?

388
00:35:54,360 --> 00:35:56,779
Yeah.

389
00:35:56,779 --> 00:36:03,619
See, I study what the market wants, right?
And this is a beta version that's due out next week.

390
00:36:03,619 --> 00:36:05,163
So you think its going to be a big hit?

391
00:36:08,624 --> 00:36:13,754
I think that it's going to make over $200 million in sales in the first week.

392
00:36:13,796 --> 00:36:15,464
So, yeah.

393
00:36:15,506 --> 00:36:17,967
Alright.. you're on.

394
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:25,016
If you're right, free romano's for a month.

395
00:36:25,057 --> 00:36:27,643
Oh, wow..

396
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:31,105
Okay.. and if I'm wrong?

397
00:36:31,147 --> 00:36:36,694
Then you have to get a real job, right here, bussing tables.

398
00:36:36,736 --> 00:36:40,364
Oh yeah, my father would be proud of that..

399
00:36:40,406 --> 00:36:41,866
Father?

400
00:36:41,908 --> 00:36:46,621
Yeah, he seems to think I'm mortified by manual labor.

401
00:36:46,662 --> 00:36:49,457
Ah.. and- he's right?

402
00:36:49,498 --> 00:36:54,378
AND, it doesn't matter, because I'm not going to lose..

403
00:36:54,420 --> 00:36:58,007
Ah, that's awfully confident.

404
00:36:58,007 --> 00:37:00,968
Besides, I bought 1000 shares already, so..

405
00:37:01,010 --> 00:37:04,222
What if you lose?

406
00:37:04,263 --> 00:37:07,058
I'm not going to? I know what I'm doing.

407
00:37:09,518 --> 00:37:15,191
Okay, so.. say this big gamble goes bad..

408
00:37:15,191 --> 00:37:16,817
What do you do, just move back home?

409
00:37:16,859 --> 00:37:22,865
No, no.. cause it's not going to, trust me.

410
00:37:22,865 --> 00:37:28,246
It's not that I have don't have faith in your "ability",

411
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:32,833
but it's not really like you have any control over it, right?

412
00:37:32,875 --> 00:37:35,002
I mean it's just gambling.

413
00:37:35,044 --> 00:37:38,464
Well there is an inherent risk, yeah, but..

414
00:37:40,549 --> 00:37:46,097
.. alright, worst-case scenario, I break even,
or I lose some cash in the short term

415
00:37:46,138 --> 00:37:50,059
if the game doesn't sell as well as I think it will..

416
00:37:50,059 --> 00:37:54,355
Which won't happen because I'm not gonna lose..

417
00:37:54,397 --> 00:38:00,611
Yeah, you just lose 10.. 20 grand, no big deal.

418
00:38:00,653 --> 00:38:06,951
So.. how did you make all this money, anyways? Rich parents?

419
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:13,874
It's alright, it's none of my business..

420
00:38:13,916 --> 00:38:16,544
No, no, it's fine.

421
00:38:16,585 --> 00:38:21,549
I left home with a.. good chunk of change, yeah..

422
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:24,302
Must be nice.

423
00:38:24,343 --> 00:38:27,430
It's not like that, I mean..

424
00:38:27,430 --> 00:38:30,474
I came here for a reason, obviously..

425
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:36,397
I don't know, I had to get out of there, it was just..

426
00:38:36,439 --> 00:38:38,733
.. stiffling, you know?

427
00:38:38,774 --> 00:38:42,820
Oh yeah, I know exactly what you mean..

428
00:38:42,862 --> 00:38:45,906
Why'd you move here anyway?

429
00:38:45,948 --> 00:38:47,783
Same reasons.

430
00:38:47,825 --> 00:38:53,331
Just had to get out, do something on my own.

431
00:38:53,372 --> 00:38:55,624
"Find myself", all of that..

432
00:38:55,624 --> 00:38:57,251
Yeah..

433
00:38:57,293 --> 00:39:02,298
Uh, anyways, my shift is up, so I'm going to this thing..

434
00:39:02,298 --> 00:39:03,424
Where?

435
00:39:03,466 --> 00:39:05,926
Uh.. It's a book fair?

436
00:39:05,968 --> 00:39:09,847
A book fair? Are you in middle school?

437
00:39:09,889 --> 00:39:14,310
Yeah.. there's going to be some cool authors there, you know?

438
00:39:14,352 --> 00:39:15,978
You should come!

439
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:17,021
Um-

440
00:39:17,063 --> 00:39:18,147
It'll be fun!

441
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,232
Yeah, it definitely sounds interesting.

442
00:39:22,902 --> 00:39:27,656
Yeah, yeah, I'll be there, just let me pack up my stuff.

443
00:39:27,698 --> 00:39:29,492
Okay. -Okay.

444
00:40:14,286 --> 00:40:17,998
It's just nice to get out and do something different, you know?

445
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:21,710
This certainly is different.

446
00:40:21,752 --> 00:40:25,589
Well, I love books, so..

447
00:40:25,631 --> 00:40:27,675
I just have enough for one..

448
00:40:27,716 --> 00:40:30,010
One book?

449
00:40:30,052 --> 00:40:33,055
Come on, your not going to get ONE book, I've got this.

450
00:40:33,097 --> 00:40:34,557
You really don't have to do that for me.

451
00:40:34,598 --> 00:40:36,517
No, I want to..

452
00:40:36,559 --> 00:40:40,729
.. especially since you're going end up
owing me a months worth of romanos.

453
00:40:40,729 --> 00:40:42,398
Right..

454
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,567
- You remember that deal? Don't forget. - Oh yeah, I do. Okay.

455
00:40:48,571 --> 00:40:49,613
Hi.

456
00:40:49,655 --> 00:40:53,534
Um, just make it out to "Summertime".

457
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:55,244
- That's really bad. - Yeah, I know..

458
00:40:59,790 --> 00:41:02,251
Don't disappear!

459
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:04,128
So who should I make this out to?

460
00:41:04,170 --> 00:41:05,421
"Summer Squash".

461
00:41:11,093 --> 00:41:12,595
And who's this for?

462
00:41:12,595 --> 00:41:14,013
"Summer Lovin'"

463
00:41:18,434 --> 00:41:19,143
Here you go.

464
00:41:32,364 --> 00:41:35,451
Here.

465
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:38,120
"The Sicilian Nobleman's Daughter"

466
00:41:38,120 --> 00:41:40,414
Yep, it's a good read.

467
00:41:40,456 --> 00:41:42,416
I'll add it to the collection.

468
00:41:42,458 --> 00:41:46,462
Actually, I'm going to buy this for you.. just kind of my way of saying

469
00:41:46,462 --> 00:41:50,132
thank you to my noble man.

470
00:41:50,174 --> 00:41:53,677
That's cute.. come on, you ready?

471
00:41:57,848 --> 00:42:00,476
- You didn't have to get ALL of them. - Don't mention it.

472
00:42:00,518 --> 00:42:01,810
Hey, Mr. Foster!

473
00:42:01,852 --> 00:42:03,646
Hello dear! Nice to see you!

474
00:42:03,646 --> 00:42:05,439
You too! Did you hear about the book signing?

475
00:42:05,481 --> 00:42:08,984
That's why I'm here.. I see your friend took advantage!

476
00:42:09,026 --> 00:42:10,277
Sure did!

477
00:42:10,319 --> 00:42:12,321
Just can't get enough of the good word, huh?

478
00:42:12,321 --> 00:42:14,990
Nope, sure can't..

479
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:17,618
Jake, this is Mr. Foster.

480
00:42:17,660 --> 00:42:19,286
Very nice to meet you, Jake!

481
00:42:19,328 --> 00:42:20,829
Good to meet you.

482
00:42:20,871 --> 00:42:22,122
Jake's new in town.

483
00:42:22,164 --> 00:42:24,333
Oh, well welcome, welcome!

484
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,502
Do you have a church home yet?

485
00:42:26,502 --> 00:42:28,462
No, no I don't

486
00:42:28,504 --> 00:42:31,340
Well you would be certainly be welcome at the New Life Fellowship,

487
00:42:31,340 --> 00:42:33,300
it's right down the street on the right.

488
00:42:33,342 --> 00:42:35,344
You should come!

489
00:42:35,344 --> 00:42:38,639
It's perfect for people who just want to dive right in..
I hope to see you there.

490
00:42:38,681 --> 00:42:39,557
Okay.

491
00:42:39,598 --> 00:42:40,641
You take care!

492
00:42:40,683 --> 00:42:41,267
Yep, bye.

493
00:42:44,019 --> 00:42:46,397
- You ready? - Yeah.

494
00:42:51,443 --> 00:42:55,531
Hey Seth.. take a seat.

495
00:42:55,573 --> 00:43:00,578
If these are the projected numbers,
then there's not much more we can do..

496
00:43:04,623 --> 00:43:08,377
We have another option, dad..

497
00:43:08,419 --> 00:43:09,878
No Seth.

498
00:43:09,878 --> 00:43:12,047
Come on, use it!

499
00:43:12,089 --> 00:43:13,841
We're not going to use your money..

500
00:43:13,882 --> 00:43:16,760
It's either this or we lose everything!

501
00:43:16,802 --> 00:43:20,723
I would rather lose everything than leave you with nothing.

502
00:43:20,723 --> 00:43:23,267
This farm is my life, dad..

503
00:43:23,309 --> 00:43:27,730
You let me drive that tractor when my
feet could barely reach the pedals..

504
00:43:27,730 --> 00:43:31,317
.. I grew up here, I'm going to die here.

505
00:43:37,406 --> 00:43:40,242
Come on babe, let's hurry up, let's get this over with..

506
00:43:40,242 --> 00:43:44,079
Oh, Frank, it's "fashionably late",
it's the best thing about going to parties,

507
00:43:44,121 --> 00:43:45,748
people expect you to be late.

508
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:53,255
Well, for you maybe.. I'm tired of going to these things,
I'd like to stay home one night.

509
00:43:55,758 --> 00:43:57,051
Who brought you these things?

510
00:43:57,092 --> 00:43:58,260
Huh?

511
00:43:58,260 --> 00:44:00,220
The flowers.. where did you get the flowers?

512
00:44:00,262 --> 00:44:04,266
Jake brought them to me.

513
00:44:04,308 --> 00:44:06,101
Can you zip me?

514
00:44:09,271 --> 00:44:12,566
He wanted to think me for recommending the place.

515
00:44:12,608 --> 00:44:16,111
How nice of him.. a little skimpy, don't you think?

516
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:17,321
You never complained about me before?

517
00:44:18,822 --> 00:44:20,949
Not you.. the flowers.

518
00:44:20,949 --> 00:44:22,785
I mean, big, big investor..

519
00:44:22,826 --> 00:44:26,080
.. looks like he got them at a K-Mart.

520
00:44:26,121 --> 00:44:28,123
He seems pretty good at what he does, you know?

521
00:44:28,165 --> 00:44:30,834
He could be useful for both of us..

522
00:44:30,876 --> 00:44:33,796
.. You're always looking on an angle, aren't you?

523
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:36,006
You'd love the car he drives.

524
00:44:36,048 --> 00:44:39,802
Really? What's he drive?

525
00:44:39,802 --> 00:44:41,470
A Maserati.

526
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:44,139
Oh, I'm just SO thrilled..

527
00:44:44,139 --> 00:44:45,140
I know!

528
00:44:46,975 --> 00:44:51,647
You know.. come on, let's go to this thing..

529
00:44:51,689 --> 00:44:53,691
Come on.

530
00:44:53,732 --> 00:44:55,317
You like the dress?

531
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,820
I like what's in it.

532
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:04,243
Nice to see you again!

533
00:45:04,743 --> 00:45:05,661
The usual?

534
00:45:05,703 --> 00:45:07,996
Please.. can you make it to go?

535
00:45:07,996 --> 00:45:10,332
Sure, you're not sticking around to check your stocks?

536
00:45:10,374 --> 00:45:12,334
Nope, I've got somewhere to be.

537
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:15,170
World-Conquering seminar?

538
00:45:17,506 --> 00:45:19,550
What's wrong with your friend?

539
00:45:19,591 --> 00:45:24,138
I don't know, he's been weird ever since the bookstore the other day..

540
00:45:24,179 --> 00:45:27,516
What happened at the bookstore?

541
00:45:27,558 --> 00:45:30,519
I don't know..

542
00:45:30,519 --> 00:45:33,355
Maybe he's got a lot on his mind..

543
00:45:33,355 --> 00:45:34,773
.. You take care.

544
00:45:46,410 --> 00:45:47,995
I wouldn't go in there, not a good time!

545
00:45:48,036 --> 00:45:51,081
We got a problem.. the engine on the tractor is dead!

546
00:45:51,123 --> 00:45:52,207
I thought we had gotten a new one?

547
00:45:52,207 --> 00:45:54,501
We did, but Jake ordered from Benward!

548
00:45:54,543 --> 00:45:56,879
- Well didn't someone tell him about them?!
- I tried to, but he didn't want to listen!

549
00:45:56,879 --> 00:45:58,213
Well how bad is it?

550
00:45:58,255 --> 00:46:00,340
We've got to replace the whole thing..

551
00:46:00,382 --> 00:46:03,051
- We don't have the money.
- Well, we've gotta find it somewhere, or we're DONE!

552
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:06,597
I'll have to figure something out.

553
00:46:06,638 --> 00:46:09,183
[Scott Rasmussen] Sometimes the best
way to find out what somebody's thinking,

554
00:46:09,224 --> 00:46:11,435
is to ask a little bit indirectly.

555
00:46:11,477 --> 00:46:13,562
Yes!

556
00:46:13,604 --> 00:46:15,773
When we asked people to rate the economy, if their company is hiring,

557
00:46:15,814 --> 00:46:19,902
they say the economy's in good shape,
if their company is laying off, they say the economy

558
00:46:19,943 --> 00:46:23,280
is in poor shape.
So, if you want to know what somebody thinks about the strength

559
00:46:23,322 --> 00:46:27,576
of their own company, ask them how the economy is doing.

560
00:46:27,951 --> 00:46:29,953
[Knocks]

561
00:46:38,587 --> 00:46:40,881
Any interest in sharing this with me?

562
00:46:40,923 --> 00:46:42,591
Oh, you're celebrating?

563
00:46:42,591 --> 00:46:44,426
I'm celebrating.

564
00:46:44,426 --> 00:46:47,137
Okay, what are you celebrating?

565
00:46:47,179 --> 00:46:52,476
Oh nothing, just.. made a killing today.

566
00:46:52,518 --> 00:46:54,478
How much of a killing?

567
00:46:54,520 --> 00:46:59,608
Let's just say I could have sailed over here in my new boat..
if I wanted to.

568
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:01,401
- Really? - Yeah.

569
00:47:01,443 --> 00:47:07,074
So um.. you're going to celebrate with bad champagne?

570
00:47:07,115 --> 00:47:09,326
Bad.. champagne?

571
00:47:09,368 --> 00:47:10,953
Yeah, really bad..

572
00:47:10,953 --> 00:47:12,579
The guy at the store said this was good..

573
00:47:12,621 --> 00:47:13,997
No.

574
00:47:14,039 --> 00:47:15,624
No? Okay..

575
00:47:15,624 --> 00:47:20,796
I actually have a idea on how we could better spend your money..

576
00:47:20,796 --> 00:47:21,463
You do?

577
00:47:23,882 --> 00:47:25,467
I'll show you how to party.

578
00:47:28,178 --> 00:47:29,179
.. Prove it.

579
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:45,487
Jake, this is Evan,
he wrote the amazing movie script I was telling you about.

580
00:47:45,487 --> 00:47:48,490
So what is this amazing script about?

581
00:47:48,490 --> 00:47:53,036
Well, it's about the hollowness and angst of living in today's world.

582
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:58,834
All the pressures that come with the chaos that's swirling all around us.

583
00:47:58,876 --> 00:48:04,882
It's about the inner luminosity that we have going dark and coming out..

584
00:48:04,923 --> 00:48:07,009
Sounds.. deep?

585
00:48:07,009 --> 00:48:11,305
There's a great role for a lead actress..
I know it's going to make a lot of money.

586
00:48:11,346 --> 00:48:13,223
We just need to get some investors behind it.

587
00:48:13,265 --> 00:48:17,019
It's got box office hit written all over it, these are the kinds of scripts

588
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,897
that are trending all over the world.

589
00:48:19,938 --> 00:48:21,857
Sounds great.

590
00:48:21,857 --> 00:48:26,153
We just need to find a lead investor
to show other investors that someone

591
00:48:26,194 --> 00:48:30,866
believes in the project,
and then other investors are just gonna jump on board.

592
00:48:30,908 --> 00:48:33,035
A lead investor?

593
00:48:33,035 --> 00:48:35,704
So this is the better way to spend my money?

594
00:48:35,746 --> 00:48:40,042
It's not a lot of money just enough to break the ice

595
00:48:40,083 --> 00:48:42,544
How big an ice pick are we talking here?

596
00:48:42,544 --> 00:48:46,340
Well, from what I understand, it's about a day and a half of work for you.

597
00:48:46,381 --> 00:48:49,384
A good day and a half, maybe..

598
00:48:49,426 --> 00:48:50,510
You should do it.

599
00:48:50,552 --> 00:48:52,429
Why don't you do it?

600
00:48:52,471 --> 00:48:56,558
Well, I've had my time in show business..
I'm in the restaurant business now.

601
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:59,227
You should help Laura, she's a great actress.

602
00:49:01,730 --> 00:49:02,606
- Goodnight babe. - Goodnight.

603
00:49:05,233 --> 00:49:10,447
Listen, the best thing about being the lead
investor is that you would have to meet

604
00:49:10,489 --> 00:49:16,244
other investors.. you know, people with a lot of money around here?

605
00:49:16,286 --> 00:49:19,706
Which is definitely the circle you want to run in.

606
00:49:19,748 --> 00:49:21,416
That's true..

607
00:49:21,416 --> 00:49:24,878
Probably get you involved in some other projects too, you know?

608
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:28,048
You could be somebody important.

609
00:49:28,090 --> 00:49:31,218
Still, that's a hefty chunk of change..

610
00:49:31,259 --> 00:49:35,138
Yeah.. but think about all the rewards.

611
00:50:04,167 --> 00:50:08,922
[Radio] All the market indexes are up today for the sixth straight session.

612
00:50:08,964 --> 00:50:15,345
It's 7:00, good morning,
and it's time now for our Success Profile of the day,

613
00:50:15,387 --> 00:50:17,347
and on the phone with us right now is author, speaker,

614
00:50:17,389 --> 00:50:21,351
and world renown personality, Dr. Joel Wallach.

615
00:50:21,393 --> 00:50:26,356
Dr. Wallach, tell me a little bit about these products,
and the well-being they bring?

616
00:50:26,398 --> 00:50:31,653
I'm here to teach you how to live to be well
beyond 100 chronologically, say, 110, 120

617
00:50:31,653 --> 00:50:37,826
130, 140, 150, 160, while being biologically 30, 40,
or 50, if you have problems.

618
00:50:37,868 --> 00:50:43,957
If you're a baby boomer,
you were born between 1946-1964, you have a problem,

619
00:50:43,999 --> 00:50:47,002
because you've listened to doctors, you've lowered your cholesterol,

620
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:50,672
and you've got Alzheimer's Disease,
Type-II Diabetes, and Erectile Dysfunction?

621
00:50:50,714 --> 00:50:54,092
Every cell in your body is unhappy, because every cell-

622
00:51:00,849 --> 00:51:03,852
Good morning.. rough night?

623
00:51:03,852 --> 00:51:05,645
Something like that..

624
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,230
The usual?

625
00:51:07,272 --> 00:51:09,775
Yeah, can you make it a double this time?

626
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:19,201
What's wrong? You don't seem like your normal self.

627
00:51:19,242 --> 00:51:22,537
Nothing.. I just have a lot going on.

628
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:42,224
Is there anything I can do?

629
00:51:42,224 --> 00:51:43,391
Nope?

630
00:51:46,061 --> 00:51:49,981
Well you just don't seem as happy as
you were when you first moved here..

631
00:51:52,317 --> 00:51:54,277
I'm happy.

632
00:51:55,737 --> 00:51:56,738
Really?

633
00:51:56,738 --> 00:51:58,073
Yes, really.

634
00:52:00,075 --> 00:52:05,205
Jake, I wanna be here for you, I wanna help.

635
00:52:05,247 --> 00:52:06,248
Yeah, I know..

636
00:52:09,793 --> 00:52:17,092
Look, I don't know what's going on,
but I think you should just let God handle all of it,

637
00:52:17,092 --> 00:52:19,219
I mean, he knows how its going to end.

638
00:52:19,261 --> 00:52:21,638
You REALLY sound like my father right now..

639
00:52:25,100 --> 00:52:27,561
You know what I think?

640
00:52:27,602 --> 00:52:28,979
What?

641
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:32,107
I think that this is going to be good for you.

642
00:52:32,149 --> 00:52:33,608
What is?

643
00:52:33,650 --> 00:52:35,944
Just being away from your family, you know?

644
00:52:35,986 --> 00:52:40,615
It will remove all the distractions and maybe make you come face to face

645
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:43,493
with yourself and find your purpose.

646
00:52:45,620 --> 00:52:49,833
You know, you don't have to worry about me, okay? I'm fine..

647
00:52:52,460 --> 00:52:53,670
Okay.

648
00:52:55,881 --> 00:52:59,426
Well my small group is getting together later, you should come.

649
00:52:59,467 --> 00:53:05,140
Yeah, uh.. maybe, I just.. maybe another time, I have a lot to do.

650
00:53:06,808 --> 00:53:12,439
I just thought that it would be nice to spend some time together.

651
00:53:12,480 --> 00:53:13,648
You're right.

652
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:16,151
- I have to.. - Wait, hold on, Summer, hey-

653
00:53:19,404 --> 00:53:22,866
..I'm gonna try to make time for you.

654
00:53:27,412 --> 00:53:32,167
I just have a lot I'm trying to balance right now so..

655
00:53:35,420 --> 00:53:37,505
.. it'll happen.

656
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:39,007
.. Yeah.

657
00:54:05,867 --> 00:54:07,077
No way..

658
00:54:09,704 --> 00:54:11,539
.. No- WAY!

659
00:54:11,539 --> 00:54:12,582
What's going on?

660
00:54:13,875 --> 00:54:15,377
Check this out.

661
00:54:19,256 --> 00:54:22,592
I'm not really sure what I'm looking at, but,

662
00:54:22,634 --> 00:54:24,719
I guess I'm going to be owing you some free coffee.

663
00:54:24,761 --> 00:54:26,721
All month long, baby.

664
00:54:26,763 --> 00:54:30,225
Then I expect my tips to be a little bigger.. BABY.

665
00:54:30,267 --> 00:54:33,561
I.. will.. consider that!

666
00:55:24,696 --> 00:55:27,782
Oh yeah? Okay great!

667
00:55:27,782 --> 00:55:32,162
No, I'll stop by later on that'll be fun.

668
00:55:32,203 --> 00:55:35,665
Hey, if you've got a minute, stop by.

669
00:55:35,707 --> 00:55:37,125
There's someone I think you should talk with.

670
00:55:39,461 --> 00:55:42,005
Okay, bye.

671
00:55:45,383 --> 00:55:46,843
Is he coming by?

672
00:55:46,885 --> 00:55:48,970
Yeah, he'll be here in a few minutes.

673
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:50,764
Do you want ice?

674
00:55:50,805 --> 00:55:53,058
No, I'll take it neat.

675
00:55:59,981 --> 00:56:02,484
So you think it's worth doing this, huh?

676
00:56:02,484 --> 00:56:06,321
Yeah.. he made 80 grand in one day.

677
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:10,658
Looks like he knows how to make some money.

678
00:56:10,658 --> 00:56:12,994
You think it'll help you with the movie deal?

679
00:56:13,036 --> 00:56:16,831
Yeah, I do.

680
00:56:16,873 --> 00:56:18,666
Well, let's hope for the best.

681
00:56:18,666 --> 00:56:19,667
Cheers.

682
00:56:25,173 --> 00:56:29,344
Larry get the paper work prepared,
a guy name Jake Abraham will be in tomorrow afternoon.

683
00:56:32,013 --> 00:56:35,183
Yeah, the amount we discussed.

684
00:56:37,352 --> 00:56:40,230
No, I understand that, no, I think this guy's a winner.

685
00:56:42,357 --> 00:56:43,191
Okay.

686
00:56:46,027 --> 00:56:47,654
- There you go. -You won't regret it.

687
00:56:47,695 --> 00:56:48,947
I'm sure I won't.

688
00:56:51,533 --> 00:56:53,410
Let's celebrate!

689
00:56:53,451 --> 00:56:57,705
You celebrate.. I've got to go somewhere..

690
00:57:11,553 --> 00:57:12,554
Miss?

691
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:13,221
Sir?

692

- Cheers. - Cheers.

693
00:57:22,397 --> 00:57:26,609
Have you given any more thought to the movie?

694
00:57:26,651 --> 00:57:30,029
Maybe.. why?

695
00:57:30,071 --> 00:57:34,742
Because I invited the producer.. he's over there.

696
00:57:34,784 --> 00:57:35,660
You did?

697
00:57:39,289 --> 00:57:41,249
Give me a minute, would you?

698
00:57:41,249 --> 00:57:41,833
Why?

699
00:58:37,138 --> 00:58:38,640
Hello dear!

Hey.

701
00:58:39,974 --> 00:58:42,101
Have you seen today's paper?

702
00:58:42,143 --> 00:58:43,686
No?

703
00:58:43,728 --> 00:58:45,355
Is that your friend's family?

704
00:58:50,193 --> 00:58:53,154
Sorry, I- I have to go..

705
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:11,965
Hello boys.

00:59:12,006 --> 00:59:13,675
Enjoying the party?

707
00:59:16,594 --> 00:59:19,180
Just talking shop.. you?

708
00:59:23,851 --> 00:59:26,062
Jake, right?

709
00:59:26,104 --> 00:59:28,982
Some dude just yacked in your dishwasher.

710
00:59:29,023 --> 00:59:31,401
I'm not going to lie, it was pretty sweet.

711
00:59:31,442 --> 00:59:33,319
Great..

712
00:59:33,361 --> 00:59:34,737
You just want me to run the dishwasher?

713
00:59:34,779 --> 00:59:36,864
Yeah, yeah, fine..

714
00:59:36,906 --> 00:59:41,703
.. run it on pots and pans; it really gets in there.

[Apartment Speaker System] Jake?

716
00:59:47,875 --> 00:59:50,628
Jake, are you in there? Can I come in?

717
01:00:42,597 --> 01:00:44,557
Excuse me..

718
01:00:44,599 --> 01:00:45,433
.. Can you give this to Jake?

719
01:02:39,797 --> 01:02:46,554
See, Ken, what I'm saying is if we get a lead
investor to put some money up for the project

720
01:02:46,554 --> 01:02:52,226
and show that they really believe in it then other investors

721
01:02:53,770 --> 01:02:56,272
they'll put money up too, they'll be on board.

722
01:02:56,314 --> 01:03:00,067
It's not a lot of money, just enough to break the ice.

723
01:03:40,358 --> 01:03:43,110
Another hang over?

724
01:03:43,152 --> 01:03:47,240
No.. I just don't feel too well.

725
01:03:47,281 --> 01:03:48,324
- Could I get another- - No.

726
01:03:50,827 --> 01:03:53,246
What do you mean "no"?

727
01:03:53,287 --> 01:03:55,623
Jake.. forget the coffee, I'm trying-

728
01:03:55,665 --> 01:03:59,126
You really stepped up the service in this place, haven't you?

729
01:04:01,629 --> 01:04:07,260
You know, I thought that you were a nice guy.

730
01:04:07,301 --> 01:04:11,806
Yeah, you can be a jerk sometimes, but..

731
01:04:11,806 --> 01:04:14,892
Jake, you really don't have to keep living your life like this..

732
01:04:16,978 --> 01:04:19,647
What.. are you talking about?

733
01:04:19,647 --> 01:04:23,484
Look, you came here to make something of yourself

734
01:04:23,484 --> 01:04:25,653
Yeah, and I AM.

735
01:04:27,154 --> 01:04:28,656
Are you?

736
01:04:31,492 --> 01:04:36,330
You know,
I really don't see how this is really any of your business to begin with.

737
01:04:36,372 --> 01:04:40,835
- Well, I thought.. - Well, no.. no, okay? It's not.

738
01:04:40,877 --> 01:04:46,799
Don't think that you can CHANGE me somehow,
like you can make me a better person.

739
01:04:46,841 --> 01:04:50,595
Alright? I'm fine on my own, understand?

740
01:04:54,181 --> 01:04:55,016
.. Yeah.

741
01:05:29,884 --> 01:05:33,638
What? No..

742
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:37,433
.. no, no, no, no..

[Reading] Due to irregularities in the companies earning reports,

744
01:05:55,576 --> 01:06:00,206
the SCC today froze trading on the stock.

745
01:06:00,247 --> 01:06:01,999
No, no, no, no, that's not possible..

746
01:06:07,964 --> 01:06:09,465
Come on!

747
01:06:19,767 --> 01:06:20,476
Hey!

748
01:06:20,518 --> 01:06:22,770
Hey, come in.

749
01:06:22,770 --> 01:06:28,442
So I talked with my producer,
and I was wanting to talk to you about investing more money.

750
01:06:28,442 --> 01:06:30,820
Hey, what's going on?

751
01:06:30,861 --> 01:06:31,904
It's all gone..

752
01:06:31,946 --> 01:06:33,447
- What's all gone? - The money.

753
01:06:33,489 --> 01:06:35,157
What do you mean?

754
01:06:35,199 --> 01:06:38,160
I mean the company lied to the SCC about how much

755
01:06:38,202 --> 01:06:40,871
capital they had on hand to make this big deal.

756
01:06:43,124 --> 01:06:45,960
They wanted to inflate their stocks artificially
so that they could use it to borrow against,

757
01:06:46,002 --> 01:06:48,129
that way they would have enough money to manufacture the product.

758
01:06:48,129 --> 01:06:49,338
What are you talking about?

759
01:06:49,380 --> 01:06:50,840
I'm talking about THEY LIED.

760
01:06:50,881 --> 01:06:53,676
Laura, they lied, and the government found out about it.

761
01:06:53,718 --> 01:06:55,261
So?

762
01:06:55,302 --> 01:06:59,140
So the assets, the stocks.. everything is frozen by the SCC

763
01:06:59,181 --> 01:07:03,102
which means you and I now own shares that mean nothing.

764
01:07:03,144 --> 01:07:09,608
We can't do anything with it, we can't share them,
we can't trade then, we can't sell them.

765
01:07:09,650 --> 01:07:15,990
They're stuck.. ok? They're stuck,
just sitting there in the account, doing nothing.

766
01:07:17,199 --> 01:07:19,660
It'll take a lawsuit to get our money back..

767
01:07:19,702 --> 01:07:21,829
How long's it going to take?

768
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:25,791
Months? Years, even, who knows? Even then,
we'll only get pennies back on the dollar.

769
01:07:25,833 --> 01:07:26,959
No..

01:07:27,001 --> 01:07:29,170
- Yeah, we're toast. - No, YOU'RE toast!

771
01:07:29,170 --> 01:07:31,672
Frank made the investment on YOUR recommendation.

772
01:07:31,672 --> 01:07:33,799
Yeah, well, he KNEW it was a risk he cant hold that against me

773
01:07:33,841 --> 01:07:37,303
Do you understand what an IDIOT you've
made me look like in front of all my friends

774
01:07:37,344 --> 01:07:40,848
saying that "we're going forward with this movie project"?
You're disgusting..

775
01:07:40,848 --> 01:07:44,810
Alright, settle down, okay? All we have to do is think of a new plan..

776
01:07:44,852 --> 01:07:48,064
No, no, no, I don't know if you've noticed, but there's no more "we"..

01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:11,105
Look, I know your mad at me, but have you seen Frank?

780
01:09:11,147 --> 01:09:16,986
Yeah.. um.. he thinks you lied about everything.

781
01:09:17,027 --> 01:09:19,446
- I didn't. - Doesn't matter.

782
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:24,493
He's out half a million dollars because of you..
he's coming for his money.

783
01:09:24,535 --> 01:09:26,245
I don't have it!

784
01:09:26,287 --> 01:09:31,125
He's not going to stop until he finds you, Jake.. he'll kill you.

785
01:09:31,125 --> 01:09:35,963
Okay, okay, fine tell him.. look, tell him he can have the condo, alright?

786
01:09:35,963 --> 01:09:37,965
The car.. I-I'll leave the keys for him.

787
01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:39,592
Jake, that's not going to work..

788
01:09:39,633 --> 01:09:43,470
Frank isn't exactly the kind of person to hold a garage sale..

789
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:45,139
.. You're gonna have to come up with the cash.

790
01:09:45,139 --> 01:09:47,474
I lost WAY more than he did!

791
01:09:47,516 --> 01:09:48,184
He doesn't care..

792
01:09:51,478 --> 01:09:53,981
I can't pay him, okay?

793
01:09:55,232 --> 01:09:57,902
Then you better disappear.

May I help you?

Yeah, I need to talk to Jake.

You know when he'll be back?

800

I have no idea..

801
01:11:05,302 --> 01:11:06,887
You have any idea where he might be?

802
01:11:06,929 --> 01:11:08,889
No, he didn't let me know where he was going.

You make me chase you like I'm some chump?!?

01:15:32,819 --> 01:15:36,698

01:16:32,879 --> 01:16:34,673
Long story..

835
01:16:34,715 --> 01:16:36,550
Usually is..

836
01:16:36,592 --> 01:16:38,719
I need a gun.

837
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:39,970
Have you ever used one?

838
01:16:41,555 --> 01:16:42,931
No.

839
01:16:42,973 --> 01:16:45,475
You've gotta get training to be able to use it safely.

840
01:16:51,732 --> 01:16:55,068
Here.. can I trade this for one?

841
01:16:55,110 --> 01:16:58,196
We don't do trades here.. we aren't a pawn shop.

842
01:16:58,238 --> 01:17:00,741
I don't have money.

843
01:17:00,741 --> 01:17:05,245
Well, I can't do it.. that looks like a special watch.. you ought-a keep it.

844
01:19:06,074 --> 01:19:08,243
Hey.

Hungry?

848
01:19:18,253 --> 01:19:19,296
Apparently.

849
01:19:22,215 --> 01:19:26,553
First piece of advice..
your sob story is not any better than anybody else's in here,

850
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:28,263
so don't think you'll win any sympathy.

851
01:19:30,223 --> 01:19:32,893
I never said that..

852
01:19:35,061 --> 01:19:37,564
Where do they get the food from anyway?

853
01:19:37,606 --> 01:19:43,028
People fulfill the needs of other
anonymously through "My Neighbor in Need"

854
01:19:43,069 --> 01:19:45,739
Yeah, I saw that on the way in.

855
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:50,160
It's true; strangers are helping strangers everyday.

856
01:19:52,120 --> 01:19:56,833
Let me guess: you were on top of the world.. rich and popular.

01:20:00,420 --> 01:20:02,047
College degree?

858
01:20:02,088 --> 01:20:04,090
Yep.

859
01:20:04,090 --> 01:20:07,469
Well, how 'bout that? We've got ourselves a speller!

860
01:20:07,511 --> 01:20:10,931
Maybe you could help some of the boys with their signs.

861
01:20:12,516 --> 01:20:15,435
Number two: Don't pan-handle at the gray house down the street.

862
01:20:15,477 --> 01:20:18,772
They're Canadians; takes forever to get rid of those quarters.

863
01:20:20,273 --> 01:20:22,067
Okay?

864
01:20:22,108 --> 01:20:24,986
Three: You need to have prepared answers for the two

865
01:20:25,028 --> 01:20:27,280
most common questions you'll get in here.

01:20:27,864 --> 01:20:29,241
Yeah? What's that?

867
01:20:29,282 --> 01:20:30,116
"Why are you homeless?"

868
01:20:31,117 --> 01:20:34,120
I always answer "by choice".

869
01:20:35,789 --> 01:20:39,125
It takes them a while to come up with a follow up.

870
01:20:39,167 --> 01:20:41,127
And the second question?

871
01:20:43,004 --> 01:20:48,802
Well, this place is run by a church,
so they'll wanna know if you need prayer.

872
01:20:50,178 --> 01:20:52,472
What do you say?

873
01:20:52,472 --> 01:20:55,976
I always say "yes"..

874
01:20:55,976 --> 01:20:58,478
.. but you'll need to come up with your own answer.

875
01:20:59,688 --> 01:21:03,984
Practice: Do you need to pray with someone?

876
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:07,863
I'm fine.

877
01:21:10,991 --> 01:21:14,661
Yeah.. I don't think you'll get away with that answer..

878
01:21:14,661 --> 01:21:15,829
Why not?

879
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:17,038
'Cause you're lying.

880
01:21:21,668 --> 01:21:23,670
I'm going to get some food.

881
01:21:31,094 --> 01:21:34,264
You'd think after fourteen hours of work I could get some sleep.

882
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:37,100
You have a job?

883
01:21:41,021 --> 01:21:43,273
I'm homeless, not jobless.

884
01:21:48,194 --> 01:21:50,280
Where do you work?

885
01:21:50,739 --> 01:21:51,239
On a farm.

886
01:21:52,616 --> 01:21:53,700
Really?

887
01:21:55,869 --> 01:22:03,043
Yeah, it's a pig farm.. nothing glamorous, but it pays the bills.

888
01:22:04,544 --> 01:22:06,212
I use to work on a farm.

889
01:22:09,799 --> 01:22:11,384
You don't look it.

890
01:22:11,426 --> 01:22:16,723
Yeah.. yeah that's cause I gave it up.

891
01:22:16,765 --> 01:22:20,393
Of course you did.

892
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:23,605
For all of this..

893
01:22:25,732 --> 01:22:28,568
There may be some work on the farm if you decide to get back into it.

894
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:33,990
No, no way.. I am DONE with farm life..

895
01:22:37,577 --> 01:22:42,666
It's the Dickenson Farm north on 17.. if you change your mind.

896
01:22:45,001 --> 01:22:48,672
Thanks, but.. I'm good.

897
01:24:35,403 --> 01:24:37,363
Jake!

898
01:24:37,363 --> 01:24:38,907
Is that you?

899
01:24:38,948 --> 01:24:40,075
Hey!

900
01:24:43,578 --> 01:24:45,538
- Hey, Al.. - You came!

901
01:24:45,580 --> 01:24:48,708
Yeah.. yeah, I came..

902
01:24:48,708 --> 01:24:52,253
Did you come to work? Because we've got plenty of work.

903
01:24:54,380 --> 01:24:56,716
Yeah, actually, that'd be great.

904
01:24:56,758 --> 01:24:59,761
Good, good..

905
01:24:59,803 --> 01:25:02,222
Sorry, can I look at that?

906
01:25:02,222 --> 01:25:03,389
- This? - Yeah.

907
01:25:10,939 --> 01:25:12,982
Come on kid, lets go to work.

908
01:25:14,067 --> 01:25:15,443
Yeah, okay.

909
01:25:23,827 --> 01:25:25,078
You know, it's hard to believe..

910
01:25:25,078 --> 01:25:26,871
What's that?

911
01:25:26,913 --> 01:25:30,250
Well, not that long ago, I was buying a speaker system for my condo..

912
01:25:30,291 --> 01:25:30,959
Yeah?

913
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:33,086
Yeah, surround sound..

914
01:25:33,086 --> 01:25:34,754
Was it any good?

915
01:25:34,754 --> 01:25:36,881
I don't know.. I never got to use it.

916
01:25:36,923 --> 01:25:39,008
- Too bad. - Yeah.

917
01:25:41,344 --> 01:25:45,598
You know the fall from the top is a LOT shorter than you might think?

918
01:25:45,598 --> 01:25:49,894
- No one ever tells you that either - Jake.. it's real simple.

919
01:25:49,936 --> 01:25:50,770
What is?

920
01:25:50,770 --> 01:25:53,565
You have a home.. go back to it.

921
01:25:53,606 --> 01:25:57,652
No, no, I can't go back to the farm..

922
01:25:57,694 --> 01:25:58,820
Why not?

923
01:25:58,862 --> 01:26:00,947
Because, they wouldn't take me

924
01:26:00,989 --> 01:26:02,740
They're your family.

925
01:26:02,782 --> 01:26:06,661
No, you don't understand, I abandoned them, okay? I betrayed them..

926
01:26:08,371 --> 01:26:10,957
Well you have a choice: you can stay here with the pigs,

927
01:26:10,999 --> 01:26:13,334
or you can go back home with the people that truly love you.

928
01:26:13,376 --> 01:26:15,336
How do you know they love me?

929
01:26:15,378 --> 01:26:18,006
Well earlier you said your father is a man of faith, right?

930
01:26:18,047 --> 01:26:19,924
Yeah?

931
01:26:19,966 --> 01:26:22,468
If that's true, then he understands a love that's greater than all sin.

932
01:26:30,018 --> 01:26:32,812
You know, I have a friend who predicted this..

933
01:26:32,854 --> 01:26:34,439
What's that?

934
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:38,318
Just that I would come face to face with myself.. with God..

935
01:26:41,905 --> 01:26:43,323
.. I don't know..

936
01:26:44,657 --> 01:26:48,786
.. maybe I could earn their love back, you know?

937
01:26:48,828 --> 01:26:53,458
Go back, work on the farm for no pay, just for food.

938
01:26:53,499 --> 01:26:56,711
Hey.. whatever gets you out of this pig pen.

939
01:27:00,340 --> 01:27:04,844
Oh, this is going to be a LOT more painful than losing all my stuff,
I'll tell you that.

940
01:27:06,179 --> 01:27:09,766
Well, I wouldn't know.. I never had surround sound.

941
01:27:12,852 --> 01:27:14,187
Thanks Al.

942
01:27:14,187 --> 01:27:15,939
Yeah, sure thing kid.

943
01:28:46,112 --> 01:28:49,574
I need you to call these guys makes sure
they are still on board with us, okay?

944
01:28:49,615 --> 01:28:52,410
Well, do you want me to email them the new numbers too?

945
01:28:52,452 --> 01:28:55,496
Absolutely, they have to know that we're still viable, okay?

946
01:28:55,538 --> 01:28:57,582
My dad has some new numbers.

947
01:28:57,623 --> 01:29:00,293
Dad, do you have the new numbers we can give to the vendors?

948
01:29:01,669 --> 01:29:02,962
.. Dad?

949
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:10,970
Dad?

950
01:29:41,167 --> 01:29:44,087
I messed up, dad, I lost it..

951
01:29:46,005 --> 01:29:47,965
.. I lost everything.

952
01:29:48,007 --> 01:29:53,346
No, you didn't lose us.. you didn't lose me.

953
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:57,683
You're my son.. you'll always be that.

954
01:30:03,272 --> 01:30:05,066
I'm so glad you're home...

955
01:30:11,697 --> 01:30:13,241
.. I'm so glad you're home.

956
01:30:20,957 --> 01:30:22,333
Dad..

957
01:30:22,375 --> 01:30:24,210
So, uh.

958
01:30:24,210 --> 01:30:28,881
.. so what's going on? I read an article that the farm was closing down..

959
01:30:28,923 --> 01:30:35,012
Our church gave us everything we needed.. our Father provided.

960
01:30:35,054 --> 01:30:40,059
All our prayers were answered.. all of our prayers!

961
01:30:47,400 --> 01:30:50,278
Hey everybody! Look who's here!

962
01:30:55,074 --> 01:31:04,083
[All cheering]

963
01:31:04,125 --> 01:31:06,669
It's time for a celebration!

964
01:31:09,755 --> 01:31:12,133
You never gave up on me, dad..

965
01:31:12,175 --> 01:31:13,468
Never.

966
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,863
Hey, Jake?

967
01:31:38,493 --> 01:31:40,828
I got these for you.

968
01:31:41,621 --> 01:31:42,955
Where did you get these?

969
01:31:42,997 --> 01:31:46,667
I got those before you left.

970
01:31:46,709 --> 01:31:48,836
.. and the clothes?

971
01:31:48,878 --> 01:31:51,964
The clothes I got for you.. just in case.

972
01:31:55,134 --> 01:31:57,303
And I got this ring I want you to have..

973
01:32:03,851 --> 01:32:09,315
Look, dad, I don't deserve any of this

974
01:32:09,315 --> 01:32:10,191
Hey.

975
01:32:13,069 --> 01:32:16,030
You don't have to do anything to deserve it.

976
01:32:18,324 --> 01:32:19,867
I love you.

977
01:32:45,768 --> 01:32:48,020
You're throwing him a PARTY?

978
01:32:50,356 --> 01:32:53,859
Well.. your brother has returned..

979
01:32:55,945 --> 01:32:59,699
All these years I've worked for you, I followed your guidance,

980
01:32:59,740 --> 01:33:02,535
I've done everything that you've asked of me..

981
01:33:02,577 --> 01:33:05,204
.. you never celebrated me like that.

982
01:33:06,205 --> 01:33:08,082
Seth..

983
01:33:08,124 --> 01:33:14,839
..I have withheld NOTHING from you.. everything I have is yours.

984
01:33:14,880 --> 01:33:21,762
Jake comes crawling back here,
after wasting everything on who knows what,

985
01:33:21,804 --> 01:33:23,723
and you want to celebrate that?

986
01:33:26,475 --> 01:33:31,897
We're all together again..
and we are celebrating your brothers return home

987
01:33:31,939 --> 01:33:35,901
because he was dead, and now he is alive..

988
01:33:38,404 --> 01:33:40,990
.. he was lost, now he is found.

989
01:33:59,133 --> 01:34:05,890
Right on top, right on top the hotdog, thanks Ms. Grey.

990
01:34:05,931 --> 01:34:07,266
I'm so glad to have you home, honey.

991
01:34:12,647 --> 01:34:14,649
Hey, good to see you.

992
01:34:18,361 --> 01:34:20,279
Good to see you guys.

993
01:34:24,992 --> 01:34:29,455
Oh ok, I see how it is.. you did it, dad!

994
01:34:29,455 --> 01:34:31,165
I mean, we haven't had a party like this since

995
01:34:31,207 --> 01:34:33,209
Since the day you left.

996
01:34:35,961 --> 01:34:38,339
Alright, wow, a sense of humor!

997
01:34:38,381 --> 01:34:41,300
Yeah, yeah.. I found it the other day, you like it?

998
01:34:41,342 --> 01:34:42,968
I'll have to get used to it..

999
01:34:44,512 --> 01:34:49,850
So dad, I was thinking.. I know what I want to do for the farm.

1000
01:34:49,892 --> 01:34:52,812
My two sons, I love you.

1001
01:34:52,812 --> 01:34:54,313
We love you too, dad.

1002
01:34:59,485 --> 01:35:01,195
I heard you served coffee in here.

1003
01:35:04,532 --> 01:35:07,868
Wow, looks like you got yourself a proper job.

1004
01:35:07,910 --> 01:35:13,499
Yeah.. told my father I wanted to learn
the company from the ground up, so..

1005
01:35:13,499 --> 01:35:15,209
You went home?

1006
01:35:15,251 --> 01:35:17,336
Yeah, I did..

1007
01:35:18,170 --> 01:35:20,506
That's good.. good for you.

1008
01:35:24,844 --> 01:35:26,887
I was a jerk, Summer.

1009
01:35:31,016 --> 01:35:33,060
- .. yeah. - Yeah.

1010
01:35:34,854 --> 01:35:38,524
And, um.. I'm sorry.

1011
01:35:40,192 --> 01:35:42,069
I really am..

1012
01:35:43,779 --> 01:35:45,197
.. Do you forgive me?

1013
01:35:52,204 --> 01:35:53,539
Yeah.

1014
01:35:55,374 --> 01:35:56,625
Yeah?

1015
01:35:58,711 --> 01:36:03,132
Um.. you think maybe we could just start over?

1016
01:36:05,551 --> 01:36:07,887
Start what over?

1017
01:36:07,887 --> 01:36:14,810
Well, I make deliveries on Wednesdays now,
so maybe next week I can take you to dinner..

1018
01:36:16,479 --> 01:36:18,230
What do you say?

1019
01:36:18,272 --> 01:36:23,486
Well, um.. something expensive?

1020
01:36:25,571 --> 01:36:29,575
Yeah, I don't.. really have that kind of money anymore..

1021
01:36:32,077 --> 01:36:32,912
.. Perfect.

1022
01:36:35,247 --> 01:36:38,709
Okay.

1023
01:36:38,751 --> 01:36:42,922
I was just about to close up, do you want something?

1024
01:36:42,963 --> 01:36:46,091
Actually a regular coffee would be great.

1025
01:36:47,927 --> 01:36:49,345
Thanks.

1026
01:36:58,604 --> 01:37:01,982
- There you go. - Thank you, much needed..

1027
01:37:04,276 --> 01:37:07,780
Hey.. I missed you.

1028
01:37:07,780 --> 01:37:09,448
I missed you, too.

1029
01:37:10,324 --> 01:37:12,743
How have things been here? Busy?

1030
01:37:12,785 --> 01:37:14,995
- Yeah, good. - Yeah?

1031
01:37:15,037 --> 01:37:17,748
No uh, you know, Mr. Trumps coming in or anything..

1032
01:37:17,790 --> 01:37:24,171
Oh right, no, no ones throwing down Benjamin's?

1033
01:37:24,213 --> 01:37:26,966
Those days are over, I guess.

1034
01:37:26,966 --> 01:37:30,469
[Jose Narrating] And that's Jake's story.. a man who squandered it all

1035
01:37:30,469 --> 01:37:36,475
and in return was given something he never expected: a second chance.

1036
01:37:38,477 --> 01:37:41,272
Jake had a chip on his shoulder as big as a Sierra Madres,

1037
01:37:41,313 --> 01:37:47,653
but his stubborn spirit was no match for a father's unconditional love.
