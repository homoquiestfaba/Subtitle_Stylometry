Christopher Titus 2017 Born with A Defect

2
00:00:53,636 --> 00:00:57,974
Hello Everyone! Yes! Hello!

3
00:01:01,061 --> 00:01:07,108
Way too much! Alright! Good!
Very nice! Thank you!

4
00:01:16,031 --> 00:01:17,390
Ok, alright. That’s enough.

5
00:01:17,410 --> 00:01:19,934
I have a show to do.

6
00:01:19,954 --> 00:01:22,395
I’ve never talked about this
before, I’m gonna talk about it now…

7
00:01:22,415 --> 00:01:24,230
I was born with a defect, um,

8
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:27,484
I was actually born a
child, and,

9
00:01:27,504 --> 00:01:31,029
I don’t understand how
human beings run anything.

10
00:01:31,049 --> 00:01:33,531
We’re the only species born
without ability or instinct.

11
00:01:33,551 --> 00:01:34,657
Every other animal has it.

12
00:01:34,677 --> 00:01:36,463
Dolphin,
swims for its first breath.

13
00:01:36,483 --> 00:01:37,827
Deer, walks in an hour.

14
00:01:37,847 --> 00:01:40,330
Human child needs two
adults around it for 5 years

15
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:44,167
so it doesn’t
choke on a Cheerio.

16
00:01:44,187 --> 00:01:48,546
If babies didn’t smile
cute they would be food.

17
00:01:48,566 --> 00:01:50,131
Babies are worthless,
there’s nothing there.

18
00:01:50,151 --> 00:01:52,258
Having a baby is
like buying a laptop

19
00:01:52,278 --> 00:01:57,055
that won’t turn on
and shits itself.

20
00:01:57,075 --> 00:01:59,250
We can’t even survive
the first couple years

21
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,210
unless someone’s ramming a nipple
in our face every two hours.

22
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,771
I still feel like that to this
day, anyone else?

23
00:02:04,791 --> 00:02:06,815
Yeah. Yes, thank you.

24
00:02:06,835 --> 00:02:08,191
But,

25
00:02:08,211 --> 00:02:10,360
if it’s a boy child,
the nipple’s rammed in too often,

26
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:12,654
he has a problem with
women later in life.

27
00:02:12,674 --> 00:02:13,572
And if it’s a girl child,

28
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,225
the nipple’s rammed
in too often,

29
00:02:15,245 --> 00:02:18,868
she “experiments in college”

30
00:02:18,888 --> 00:02:23,039
You know what you did.

31
00:02:23,059 --> 00:02:26,459
Every other animal on the
planet has fear programmed.

32
00:02:26,479 --> 00:02:29,212
We invented the X-games.

33
00:02:29,232 --> 00:02:31,464
Every other animal hears a combine
going through the corn field,

34
00:02:31,484 --> 00:02:33,174
hears that motor
– hides in a hole.

35
00:02:33,194 --> 00:02:36,135
A human toddler hears a combine
going through a corn field,

36
00:02:36,155 --> 00:02:37,595
runs in front of it and goes

37
00:02:37,615 --> 00:02:39,264
“Daddy! Truck!”

38
00:02:39,284 --> 00:02:44,144
Thhrrtthrrrt, “Ahhh, dammit.
Gotta clean out the shoot again.”

39
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:45,695
That’s right. Joke number five

40
00:02:45,715 --> 00:02:48,398
we chopped up a
child in a combine.

41
00:02:48,418 --> 00:02:50,650
Are you guys ready? Good.

42
00:02:50,670 --> 00:02:53,736
Good. Yeah, yay! Wooo!

43
00:02:53,756 --> 00:02:55,613
Every other animal on the planet

44
00:02:55,633 --> 00:02:57,824
is instinctively afraid of fire.

45
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:01,536
Human beings learn about fire…

46
00:03:01,556 --> 00:03:05,081
By touching fire.

47
00:03:05,101 --> 00:03:09,544
That’s defective.
How did we get the keys to this planet?

48
00:03:09,564 --> 00:03:11,337
Now, my brother learned
about fire when he was 10,

49
00:03:11,357 --> 00:03:15,717
because 10-year-old boys are just
pyromaniac puppies with opposable thumbs.

50
00:03:15,737 --> 00:03:17,343
And we had a real
cool uncle growing up.

51
00:03:17,363 --> 00:03:19,846
Remember that cool uncle we all had
– he was so cool when you were a kid!

52
00:03:19,866 --> 00:03:21,907
And then you became
an adult and realized

53
00:03:21,927 --> 00:03:24,559
someone should have
called child services.

54
00:03:24,579 --> 00:03:26,977
“Hey, here’s a magazine.
Put that under your bed

55
00:03:26,997 --> 00:03:29,230
– don’t tell your dad, huh?

56
00:03:29,250 --> 00:03:31,524
Hey, you ever tried
120 proof Whiskey?

57
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,610
Don’t tell your dad, huh?

58
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:36,079
Don’t sign anything from
the God Damn government.

59
00:03:36,099 --> 00:03:39,240
I signed your dad’s name,
don’t tell your dad, huh?”

60
00:03:39,260 --> 00:03:41,117
That uncle.

61
00:03:41,137 --> 00:03:42,869
When we were little,
he would do like, the thumb trick.

62
00:03:42,889 --> 00:03:44,267
I mean the, the thumb… not…

63
00:03:44,287 --> 00:03:45,538
that’s the other uncle.

64
00:03:45,558 --> 00:03:46,123
That’s, no.

65
00:03:46,143 --> 00:03:48,249
He would do – the magic trick.

66
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,902
But as we got
older in my family,

67
00:03:49,922 --> 00:03:53,129
uncle started giving us
criminal knowledge at barbeques.

68
00:03:53,149 --> 00:03:55,006
And we were always hanging out with
him and the adults weren’t there,

69
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,841
I guess in case
they had to testify,

70
00:03:56,861 --> 00:03:59,052
I don’t know why.

71
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:00,762
And one day my uncle just
comes out on Fourth of July

72
00:04:00,782 --> 00:04:02,823
with this giant can
of bug spray and goes

73
00:04:02,843 --> 00:04:05,934
“Kids,
you know bug spray’s flammable?

74
00:04:05,954 --> 00:04:08,269
Don’t tell your dad!”

75
00:04:08,289 --> 00:04:09,979
Pulls a lighter and just goes

76
00:04:09,999 --> 00:04:11,940
PHHFFFFFHHHHHH

77
00:04:11,960 --> 00:04:13,733
and we were little
kids, we were just like

78
00:04:13,753 --> 00:04:16,819
“THAT’S THE COOLEST
THING WE’VE EVER SEEN!”

79
00:04:16,839 --> 00:04:18,319
And now as an adult I realize

80
00:04:18,339 --> 00:04:23,451
IT’S ALSO HOW THEY TRAIN ISIS!!

81
00:04:23,471 --> 00:04:24,869
But you can’t show
little kids this…

82
00:04:24,889 --> 00:04:27,205
so this knowledge beats around in
my brothers head for three months

83
00:04:27,225 --> 00:04:28,858
and then one day
in the backyard,

84
00:04:28,878 --> 00:04:32,293
it pops like a stupidity zit

85
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:35,120
And we had these giant concrete
planters in our backyard

86
00:04:35,140 --> 00:04:36,839
that my dad had…

87
00:04:36,859 --> 00:04:40,551
stolen from work.

88
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:44,806
Or as dad said “It aint stealin’
if they aint usin’ ‘em!”

89
00:04:44,826 --> 00:04:48,476
“Then why are we picking
them up at midnight, dad?”

90
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:53,314
“Cuz they aint usin’
‘em, dumb-ass!”

91
00:04:53,334 --> 00:04:57,277
Some of these jokes dad
wrote when he was alive, so…

92
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:59,696
So my brother gets this
big giant can of bug napalm

93
00:04:59,716 --> 00:05:01,781
and starts just filling
up this planter with mist

94
00:05:01,801 --> 00:05:03,825
and he’s throwing matches into
it, and it was working,

95
00:05:03,845 --> 00:05:04,535
it was “PHHHFHHHH”

96
00:05:04,555 --> 00:05:07,704
it was like a KISS
concert in the backyard.

97
00:05:07,724 --> 00:05:12,375
Without the 55-year-old women
flashing their boobs – oh my God.

98
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:16,629
Yeah, there’s a day for all
of us to keep our shirts down.

99
00:05:16,649 --> 00:05:19,799
And if you don’t know that day –
ask a friend, they’ll be honest.

100
00:05:19,819 --> 00:05:20,967
I have to do a little side-bar.

101
00:05:20,987 --> 00:05:24,795
I actually did a show a while back,
four years ago up in Northern California

102
00:05:24,815 --> 00:05:28,507
for uh, Michael Anthony and Sammy Hagar, then
we opened this big thing for a radio station.

103
00:05:28,527 --> 00:05:31,269
It’s 15,000 seats, I go up.
I’m doing jokes.

104
00:05:31,289 --> 00:05:33,229
In the middle of me doing jokes,

105
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:36,024
some 450 lb.,
like 60-year-old woman just goes

106
00:05:36,044 --> 00:05:38,421
“RAAAAAAAAAAH.”

107
00:05:52,143 --> 00:05:55,918
You MAY be able to play guitar…

108
00:05:55,938 --> 00:06:03,676
but it’s hard to tell jokes
with puke in your mouth.

109
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:07,555
So, my brother’s setting
these planters afire.

110
00:06:07,575 --> 00:06:09,432
He does that for like an
hour, then he gets bored,

111
00:06:09,452 --> 00:06:13,024
and he’s a 10-year-old boy so he
wants some more pyrotechnic knowledge,

112
00:06:13,044 --> 00:06:16,230
cuz he knows one day
he may be a warlock.

113
00:06:16,250 --> 00:06:17,648
He snaps a branch off a tree,

114
00:06:17,668 --> 00:06:18,609
makes a fuse out of it,

115
00:06:18,629 --> 00:06:20,485
strips it all down,
puts it in the bottom of the planter,

116
00:06:20,505 --> 00:06:23,279
coats it in this horrible,
toxic, cancer-causing bug juice,

117
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:24,405
fills it with mist again,

118
00:06:24,425 --> 00:06:25,656
and he’s gonna light it.

119
00:06:25,676 --> 00:06:28,738
But before he lights it,
he wants to see what’s gonna happen,

120
00:06:28,758 --> 00:06:30,328
so he takes his face,

121
00:06:30,348 --> 00:06:33,247
and he puts it in the planter.

122
00:06:33,267 --> 00:06:38,419
And this is why I’m pissed Youtube
didn’t exist when I was a child.

123
00:06:38,439 --> 00:06:42,006
Cuz this is,
this is sponsorship money right here.

124
00:06:42,026 --> 00:06:44,717
And he lights it,
and before he can move a millimeter,

125
00:06:44,737 --> 00:06:45,677
goes SHHHHOOPPPPHHHHH!

126
00:06:45,697 --> 00:06:50,223
Yeah...yeah.

127
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:54,685
And when he stood
up – he was tan.

128
00:06:54,705 --> 00:06:56,604
Eyebrow-less.

129
00:06:56,624 --> 00:07:00,942
And the center part of his
hair, right here, was missing.

130
00:07:00,962 --> 00:07:04,737
He looked like a 10-year-old
middle-aged accountant.

131
00:07:04,757 --> 00:07:07,865
With hair plugs.
Just ash on top of his head.

132
00:07:07,885 --> 00:07:10,034
And I come home like an hour
later and he is freaking out

133
00:07:10,054 --> 00:07:12,606
“OH MY GOD, LOOK WHAT I
DID – DAD’S GONNA KILL ME!”

134
00:07:12,626 --> 00:07:17,542
And I’m the older brother,
I said “Calm down, Dad IS gonna kill you.

135
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:20,378
But why stress if you
know it’s gonna happen?”

136
00:07:20,398 --> 00:07:22,031
“Shut up man,
you gotta help me!”

137
00:07:22,051 --> 00:07:26,717
“I can’t help you – you’ve
disfigured yourself.

138
00:07:26,737 --> 00:07:31,097
I think we can’t like, shave the dog and
made a tiny toupee, it’s gonna be stupid.

139
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,015
I mean, I’ll get out a Sharpie
and draw on your eyebrows for you,

140
00:07:33,035 --> 00:07:36,644
you’re gonna look like a pirate
on chemo that’s all I’m gonna say.

141
00:07:36,664 --> 00:07:39,230
ARG!”

142
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:41,607
Remember when you were a kid and
you committed that household felony?

143
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:44,230
We all did it, the big one.
I’m talking the big one.

144
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:46,863
You had the water fight in
the house with the hose.

145
00:07:46,883 --> 00:07:49,532
Drywall had to be replaced.

146
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:54,036
Threw a firecracker in the toilet
“Just to see what’s gonna happen.”

147
00:07:54,056 --> 00:07:59,500
Gave one of your friends antifreeze
and told him it was Gatorade.

148
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:02,795
Had to watch the EMT’s drive
off to get his stomach pumped

149
00:08:02,815 --> 00:08:06,507
AND YOU KNEW PARENTS
HAD BEEN CALLED.

150
00:08:06,527 --> 00:08:08,801
And all you had to
do was wait for Dad.

151
00:08:08,821 --> 00:08:11,721
And I wasn’t in trouble, so it was fun.
I got to observe.

152
00:08:11,741 --> 00:08:16,058
And you could see the stress tumors
metastasizing in my brother as it got closer.

153
00:08:16,078 --> 00:08:18,186
And at 5:30 you hear the car
pull in the driveway and,

154
00:08:18,206 --> 00:08:20,553
I have to admit,
my brother took it like a man.

155
00:08:20,573 --> 00:08:23,329
He went and stood right in
front of the front door just

156
00:08:24,253 --> 00:08:27,264
he looked like a guy on death
row in a Johnny Cash song just

157
00:08:28,674 --> 00:08:33,242
“I’m gonna have to pay
for what I done...”

158
00:08:33,262 --> 00:08:37,446
And my father opens the door, puts his
briefcase down, looks at my brother and goes

159
00:08:37,466 --> 00:08:43,711
“HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!”

160
00:08:43,731 --> 00:08:46,538
And my brother goes “Dad,
let me tell you what happened”

161
00:08:46,558 --> 00:08:49,091
“I don’t care what
happened – hahhahaha –

162
00:08:49,111 --> 00:08:53,846
whatever you did, you paid for it.
Haha.

163
00:08:53,866 --> 00:08:55,397
DON’T DO IT AGAIN GOD DAMMIT!”

164
00:08:59,413 --> 00:09:00,895
We’re idiots.

165
00:09:00,915 --> 00:09:03,564
As a species it’s
just, we’re idiots.

166
00:09:03,584 --> 00:09:09,987
And I am a father, which just,
you know, was just a mistake.

167
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,948
And frightens people.

168
00:09:11,968 --> 00:09:15,159
When I tell people I have kids,
they don’t go “boys or girls?”

169
00:09:15,179 --> 00:09:18,663
they go “Really?

170
00:09:18,683 --> 00:09:21,415
They okay?”

171
00:09:21,435 --> 00:09:23,417
“Ehhhhh,

172
00:09:23,437 --> 00:09:26,170
compared to me? Uh, yeah.”

173
00:09:26,190 --> 00:09:28,047
I have two kids.
Uh, two marriages.

174
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:34,303
And a parade of stress polyps
in my colon having a rave.

175
00:09:34,323 --> 00:09:37,895
And if you’re a parent tonight,
you know what a joy having children is.

176
00:09:37,915 --> 00:09:43,896
And if you’re a parent tonight, you know it’s
hard to say that sentence without laughing.

177
00:09:43,916 --> 00:09:47,108
Every parent in this room
at one point has stared

178
00:09:47,128 --> 00:09:51,404
into their children’s yellow,
hazy, sugar-fueled eyes and thought

179
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:56,075
“I was tricked.

180
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:58,828
I could have been something.

181
00:09:58,848 --> 00:10:03,207
Next Thanksgiving I’m punching
my mom in the throat."

182
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:05,334
And that’s where
love comes from.

183
00:10:05,354 --> 00:10:15,136
And I want to be clear – I do love
my kids because I... hate jail.

184
00:10:15,156 --> 00:10:19,056
And this is about the time of the show where
women tend to get a little stink-face going on.

185
00:10:19,076 --> 00:10:21,225
They’re like “Oh my God what’s
he talking about? Kids are great.

186
00:10:21,245 --> 00:10:27,023
What is he talking about? They’re amazing,
they’re little Jesus tears, that’s what they are.”

187
00:10:27,043 --> 00:10:29,609
No, not all. No.

188
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:33,487
They’re little Jesus hemorrhoids,
that’s what they are.

189
00:10:33,507 --> 00:10:38,034
Yeah. They are painful,
annoying and hard to get rid of.

190
00:10:38,054 --> 00:10:41,120
I just described a hemorrhoid.
That’s a hemorrhoid.

191
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:44,665
Alright, let me ask you parents who actually
think their kids just “rule the world,

192
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:46,299
they’re the greatest
thing ever.”

193
00:10:46,319 --> 00:10:47,926
When’s the last time your kid
walked in the room and said

194
00:10:47,946 --> 00:10:52,340
“Mom, Dad,
can I help you with anything?

195
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,842
Mom, Dad what would YOU
like for Christmas?”

196
00:10:54,862 --> 00:10:58,554
Do you realize if you had a
friend that borrowed $20 from you

197
00:10:58,574 --> 00:11:01,432
so he could go out and buy
you a shitty birthday present,

198
00:11:01,452 --> 00:11:04,977
you would stab him in
the face with a fork?

199
00:11:04,997 --> 00:11:08,397
Yeah I want to be clear about what
tonight’s show is gonna be about.

200
00:11:08,417 --> 00:11:10,816
If you are a parent,
tonight’s show is therapy.

201
00:11:10,836 --> 00:11:15,132
If you don’t have kids, tonight’s
show is 90 minutes of birth control.

202
00:11:16,592 --> 00:11:24,413
You’re welcome. You.
Are. Welcome.

203
00:11:24,433 --> 00:11:27,208
They’re horrible, man.

204
00:11:27,228 --> 00:11:32,338
Having a kid is like putting
all your money into asbestos.

205
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:37,968
Dangerous, causes disease and if
it’s yours, you’re liable for it.

206
00:11:37,988 --> 00:11:40,744
They are. They’re just little
disease-filled skin-bags,

207
00:11:40,764 --> 00:11:45,518
passing onto you every disease that’s
floating through its preschool, man.

208
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:50,398
Preschool, just a viral hot-zone full
of patient zeros, that’s all it is.

209
00:11:50,418 --> 00:11:52,900
A room full of
sociopathic humans

210
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:57,738
who can play board games while
SITTING IN THEIR OWN FECES.

211
00:11:57,758 --> 00:12:01,721
THAT’S MENTAL PATIENT BEHAVIOR!

212
00:12:04,890 --> 00:12:08,290
And every parent in this room
at one point has had a sick kid,

213
00:12:08,310 --> 00:12:11,669
and sent it to school anyway.

214
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,463
Yeaaah. I know you people without kids are
thinking “That’s horrible, that’s irresponsible!”

215
00:12:14,483 --> 00:12:19,697
Well, maybe, but also,
sometimes you need a couple fuckin’ hours.

216
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,934
The problem is every other
parent did the same thing,

217
00:12:26,954 --> 00:12:29,854
or that joke would
have gotten one laugh,

218
00:12:29,874 --> 00:12:34,483
and we would have beat the Hell out of
that person for making our kid sick.

219
00:12:34,503 --> 00:12:36,777
The problem is we all send them to
school, put them in one room,

220
00:12:36,797 --> 00:12:39,613
see what kind of Ebola
cocktail they can come up with…

221
00:12:39,633 --> 00:12:42,616
I’m not worried about terrorists
coming up with a super-plague

222
00:12:42,636 --> 00:12:46,903
– I’m worried about it being weaponized at
naptime. That’s when it’s gonna get weird.

223
00:12:46,923 --> 00:12:49,270
You know who’s going to
survive the apocalypse?

224
00:12:49,290 --> 00:12:52,543
Cockroaches and
Kindergarten teachers.

225
00:12:52,563 --> 00:12:55,337
Cuz their immune system
is just AMAZING. Yeah,

226
00:12:55,357 --> 00:12:58,758
“Knock her down,
we gotta get the antidote.”

227
00:12:58,778 --> 00:13:03,407
They’re horrible. Any why is every little
kid under 6 always oozing something?

228
00:13:04,992 --> 00:13:06,759
What the Hell is
coming out of them?

229
00:13:06,779 --> 00:13:08,565
It’s not a solid,
it’s not a liquid,

230
00:13:08,585 --> 00:13:11,228
it’s nowhere on the element
chart, what is it?

231
00:13:11,248 --> 00:13:15,316
How come every kid under 6
is just a little bit steamy?

232
00:13:15,336 --> 00:13:16,276
Have you ever
touched a little kid?

233
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,904
It’s like Ch-Chhh “Ahhhhhh.”

234
00:13:19,924 --> 00:13:22,323
Trying to pull your hand out is like
trying to get Velcro off a poodle

235
00:13:22,343 --> 00:13:24,742
– Ch-Chhhh “Ehhhh!

236
00:13:24,762 --> 00:13:26,019
What the Hell is on you?”

237
00:13:26,039 --> 00:13:27,354
“There’s nothing on me!”

238
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:32,500
Pppppfffthhhhhhh-pppffffffff.

239
00:13:32,520 --> 00:13:34,459
And they love it.
Whatever goo that is,

240
00:13:34,479 --> 00:13:36,879
they love it. They love it.
I can prove it.

241
00:13:36,899 --> 00:13:39,590
Try to wipe any kid
under 6 with a napkin.

242
00:13:39,610 --> 00:13:45,366
It’s like you’re
pepper-spraying them.

243
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:54,163
How defective is that?

244
00:13:54,183 --> 00:13:57,959
You’re literally covered in slime that
could wipe out an indigenous people,

245
00:13:58,838 --> 00:14:04,343
and you just keep eating
your fucking cookie.

246
00:14:05,719 --> 00:14:08,786
That joke came from
a real place – I,

247
00:14:08,806 --> 00:14:11,038
I was doing bills one night,
I was doing all the bills

248
00:14:11,058 --> 00:14:15,334
and I did all the like, the household
bills, then I did my wife and I bills,

249
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:19,079
and then the kid bills, and there was
more kid bills than the adult bills.

250
00:14:19,099 --> 00:14:22,341
And I got – I went
to a bad place,

251
00:14:22,361 --> 00:14:25,135
and I was walking through the house and I
walked past the living room where my kids were

252
00:14:25,155 --> 00:14:30,558
and they weren’t digging ditches
or putting an addition on the house

253
00:14:30,578 --> 00:14:36,105
they were on the couch, wrapped in blankets,
eating the tray of cookies in front of them.

254
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:41,944
And I just stopped
and “Look at you.

255
00:14:41,964 --> 00:14:45,990
Sitting there eating
your fucking cookies.”

256
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:50,704
And then in my head went, “back out of the room,
you don’t want to be in the news like this."

257
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,830
And I walk away.

258
00:14:52,850 --> 00:14:55,165
Just little disease-filled skin
bags that want you to hug it.

259
00:14:55,185 --> 00:14:57,042
That’s all that they are.

260
00:14:57,062 --> 00:15:00,379
People complain all the time “Ah, I wasn’t hugged
enough as a child, I had to go to therapy.”

261
00:15:00,399 --> 00:15:05,843
Hug you? Until you were 10 you
were a pathogen with legs, man.

262
00:15:05,863 --> 00:15:10,492
Between 1 and 3 all of us were just war
crimes in plastic pants, that’s all we were.

263
00:15:14,914 --> 00:15:16,020
Ahh, and I don’t care
if you have kids or not.

264
00:15:16,040 --> 00:15:21,609
Everybody in this room at one point has walked into
someone else’s house who has kids and said this sentence

265
00:15:21,629 --> 00:15:27,051
“What is that smell?”

266
00:15:32,264 --> 00:15:33,787
And I don’t mean the baby
smell when they’re little,

267
00:15:33,807 --> 00:15:35,998
the talcum powdery,
that’s kinda cute.

268
00:15:36,018 --> 00:15:40,461
I mean once they hit
the larvae stage.

269
00:15:40,481 --> 00:15:42,421
And the first time it happened to
me, my son was 7

270
00:15:42,441 --> 00:15:44,506
and you’re not ready for it,
I didn’t know what the Hell it was,

271
00:15:44,526 --> 00:15:49,678
I walked in and went “Oh, ahh, uh.
Honey, call State Farm!

272
00:15:49,698 --> 00:15:59,229
We have toxic mold – everyone get their masks
on, we’re gonna be Japanese for a couple weeks!”

273
00:15:59,249 --> 00:16:01,273
Did you hear that pause?

274
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,763
That was that pause, you guys checked
to see if that joke was racist.

275
00:16:04,783 --> 00:16:11,116
You went “HA...uhhh...heh."

276
00:16:11,136 --> 00:16:15,245
Don’t worry, I got this,
relax, I cleared it.

277
00:16:15,265 --> 00:16:17,998
You know, whenever I see 12 Japanese
people in the airport with masks on,

278
00:16:18,018 --> 00:16:20,167
I never think “That is
so cute culturally.”

279
00:16:20,187 --> 00:16:26,298
I always think “What
the Hell do they know?”

280
00:16:26,318 --> 00:16:36,266
I’m gonna go down to the Rosetta Stone
kiosk and get some God damn answers.

281
00:16:36,286 --> 00:16:38,560
So you walk into the house as
a parent and you’re thinking,

282
00:16:38,580 --> 00:16:41,522
“Ok, what is that smell?
Oh, I know what that smell is –

283
00:16:41,542 --> 00:16:48,362
that smell is one of the
tiny pets that disappeared.”

284
00:16:48,382 --> 00:16:50,934
Cuz when they’re little
you can’t talk about death.

285
00:16:50,954 --> 00:16:55,035
When a pet dies when they’re
little, it’s like a mob hit.

286
00:16:55,055 --> 00:16:58,122
“Daddy,
what happened to Mr. Pickles?”

287
00:16:58,142 --> 00:17:04,565
“Mr.
Pickles got a job downstate.

288
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,928
Why you aksing so
many questions?

289
00:17:12,948 --> 00:17:16,928
How ‘bout you go in the other room and
eat your fuckin’ cookie, how ‘bout that?

290
00:17:16,948 --> 00:17:20,910
How ‘bout that, huh?”

291
00:17:24,209 --> 00:17:25,357
And then you walk into
the house and you go

292
00:17:25,377 --> 00:17:30,614
“OK, I know what I’m looking for now, I’m looking for
a guinea pig corpse, that’s what I’m looking for.”

293
00:17:30,634 --> 00:17:33,237
And after a while you think,
“That smell is too big,

294
00:17:33,257 --> 00:17:39,970
maybe someone left a tuna fish sandwich
in the vagina of a sperm whale, cuz…”

295
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:50,257
Yeah, that one’s a little tart isn’t it?
That one?

296
00:17:50,277 --> 00:17:55,240
It’s one of those special
laughs “Hahaha-thpthtpthpthpt”

297
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,935
I have two children,
I have two children.

298
00:18:02,955 --> 00:18:05,762
I have a uh, 12 year old boy
and a 14-year-old girl, uh,

299
00:18:05,782 --> 00:18:09,568
so my house is the thunder
dome of stink right now.

300
00:18:09,588 --> 00:18:14,793
It is a dueling piano bar of odor and they are trading
the title all the time, it’s really interesting.

301
00:18:14,813 --> 00:18:18,994
My daughter is also going through
the change which is just amazing.

302
00:18:19,014 --> 00:18:22,706
Amazing, oh.

303
00:18:22,726 --> 00:18:28,065
“Hi Daddy.
Hahaha, herherher, arhaahaha.”

304
00:18:33,487 --> 00:18:36,428
“Honey, calm down,
I know what this is.

305
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:39,932
You are very pretty.

306
00:18:39,952 --> 00:18:43,352
And here are some M&M’s.”

307
00:18:43,372 --> 00:18:45,771
I’m a good dad.

308
00:18:45,791 --> 00:18:51,527
My son is 12,
which means he is Olympic-level dumb.

309
00:18:51,547 --> 00:18:54,947
10 to 14-year-old boys,
man, I don’t understand.

310
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:57,616
I thought he was on the
spectrum for a long time.

311
00:18:57,636 --> 00:19:00,994
“Well, I guess we
just got to love him.”

312
00:19:01,014 --> 00:19:04,178
And then one day a bunch of his
friends came over and I'm like,

313
00:19:04,198 --> 00:19:09,453
“Oh, they’re ALL idiots!

314
00:19:14,194 --> 00:19:19,763
Honey, we’re ok,
he’s just normal stupid, we’re fine!”

315
00:19:19,783 --> 00:19:21,723
Stupidest group of
kids I’ve ever seen.

316
00:19:21,743 --> 00:19:24,810
10 to 14-year-old boys man, if aliens
landed at my kids’ school and JUST

317
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:27,646
interviewed the 10 to 14-year-old
boys, they would vaporize the Earth.

318
00:19:27,666 --> 00:19:32,545
I mean “Nah, this species is going to die out on
its own, let’s just end it here with these guys,

319
00:19:32,565 --> 00:19:36,340
my God. Look at it. The socks don’t match, they’re
wearing cargo shorts with long sleeve shirts.

320
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:44,037
Jesus, they think they’re funny and
they’re not and WHAT IS THAT SMELL?”

321
00:19:44,057 --> 00:19:46,665
I came downstairs on a
Saturday a while back

322
00:19:46,685 --> 00:19:49,585
and my son’s sitting on the
couch watching television.

323
00:19:49,605 --> 00:19:52,629
And he has on no pants.

324
00:19:52,649 --> 00:19:55,215
I don’t mean he has on
underwear and no pants…

325
00:19:55,235 --> 00:20:01,471
I mean, he’s got a long t-shirt
on, and ABSOLUTELY NO PANTS.

326
00:20:01,491 --> 00:20:06,268
And he was 11.
He knew about pants.

327
00:20:06,288 --> 00:20:07,769
I go “What are you doing?”

328
00:20:07,789 --> 00:20:11,043
“I’m watching cartoons.”

329
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:28,874
“You have no pants.”

330
00:20:28,894 --> 00:20:31,043
He looks me right
in the face and goes

331
00:20:31,063 --> 00:20:35,380
“OOOOOOOOHHHHHHH.”

332
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:39,843
Like it wasn’t even in the
top 5 things buggin’ him…

333
00:20:39,863 --> 00:20:40,720
and then…

334
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:45,891
HE GOES BACK TO
WATCHING TELEVISION.

335
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,643
To you people that
don’t have kids

336
00:20:47,663 --> 00:20:51,355
you think you’ve been
angry in your life?

337
00:20:51,375 --> 00:20:54,816
That’s adorable.

338
00:20:54,836 --> 00:20:57,027
That is soooo cute.

339
00:20:57,047 --> 00:21:00,072
I’m not saying you’ve never been
angry, I’m just saying…

340
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,784
your normal, single,
non-kid anger is a 10 here…

341
00:21:03,804 --> 00:21:09,039
when you have a child, it’s like adding a
four-inch layer of bitter frustration icing…

342
00:21:09,059 --> 00:21:15,629
that smells like almonds
and tastes like aneurism.

343
00:21:15,649 --> 00:21:18,298
And you can’t do anything because they’re
little kids, you can’t… they’re little kids.

344
00:21:18,318 --> 00:21:23,553
You can’t knee ‘em in the face
because the laws are different now.

345
00:21:23,573 --> 00:21:31,270
My dad didn’t have those laws,
that’s why I’m not symmetrical.

346
00:21:31,290 --> 00:21:34,982
And you, you just can’t start screaming
because you lose all credibility,

347
00:21:35,002 --> 00:21:38,485
so what I find myself doing
now, so nothing bad happens,

348
00:21:38,505 --> 00:21:45,117
is I turn and I walk out of the room
having a mumble argument to myself.

349
00:21:45,137 --> 00:21:48,578
“You know, really, ok… wow.
HA HA HA.

350
00:21:48,598 --> 00:21:52,499
You know what pants are. And you’re
too young to have to air it out,

351
00:21:52,519 --> 00:21:54,203
I don’t know what
you’re thinking.

352
00:21:54,223 --> 00:22:01,508
And what makes you think it’s ok to put your greasy
little boy-taint on my leather couch, my God?

353
00:22:01,528 --> 00:22:05,429
I mean, Jesus Christ,

354
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:11,121
you left a racing stripe
the dogs won’t go near.”

355
00:22:14,499 --> 00:22:16,857
I don’t think we have a homeless
problem in this Country…

356
00:22:16,877 --> 00:22:20,296
I think it’s just parents roaming
the streets talking to themselves.

357
00:22:20,316 --> 00:22:23,655
Trying to figure out what
the Hell their kid just did.

358
00:22:23,675 --> 00:22:27,951
And thank God I have a spouse because
I can go find her. say to my wife

359
00:22:27,971 --> 00:22:30,787
“Did you see what…? Cuz that… Did you tell him it was…
cuz I didn’t...I don’t even know what the fuck… you know,

360
00:22:30,807 --> 00:22:34,624
I’m gonna go for a walk.
I gotta go, I gotta go.”

361
00:22:34,644 --> 00:22:37,127
And then I find myself in front of my house
just walking down the street going like

362
00:22:37,147 --> 00:22:41,025
“Why would you put every piece of clothing
you own IN the washer at one time?

363
00:22:41,045 --> 00:22:43,842
You heard the washer going
‘YEEAAOOOUUUWAAAAOOOUH’

364
00:22:43,862 --> 00:22:47,230
and you saw the smoke and the FLAMES
pouring out of the back of it,

365
00:22:47,250 --> 00:22:51,516
after you filled it with DISH
SOAP, you little dumb-ass, my God.”

366
00:22:51,536 --> 00:22:53,934
And while I’m in front
of my house spaz-ranting,

367
00:22:53,954 --> 00:23:02,319
someone slaps a
dollar in my hand…

368
00:23:02,339 --> 00:23:06,990
I’m gonna stay out
here and do THIS.

369
00:23:07,010 --> 00:23:09,576
This is WAY easier
than raising a kid!

370
00:23:09,596 --> 00:23:15,874
And I MADE money!

371
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,251
So I come back downstairs
after I’ve calmed down,

372
00:23:18,271 --> 00:23:19,681
I go “Go get on some pants!”

373
00:23:19,701 --> 00:23:21,808
And here’s what pissed me off worse –
he got up like I did something wrong.

374
00:23:21,828 --> 00:23:30,389
He got up like “Oh, Dad lives in the
40’s where people gotta wear pants.”

375
00:23:30,409 --> 00:23:32,224
I go about my Saturday…

376
00:23:32,244 --> 00:23:35,936
I flick through some channels, I check some
emails, and blah blah blah, and I forget about him.

377
00:23:35,956 --> 00:23:38,271
For 90 minutes.

378
00:23:38,291 --> 00:23:41,400
Yeah, and THEN,
all of a sudden I realize,

379
00:23:41,420 --> 00:23:44,319
I haven’t heard a noise out of my
son in over an hour and a half.

380
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:47,072
Now, to you people without kids –
that sounds amazing, doesn’t it?

381
00:23:47,092 --> 00:23:48,615
“Oh God, how great was that?”

382
00:23:48,635 --> 00:23:51,368
Noooooooo.

383
00:23:51,388 --> 00:23:56,540
No. Until you have one,
you will not know the bone-chilling terror

384
00:23:56,560 --> 00:24:02,421
of that first nano-second you
notice the death-like silence

385
00:24:02,441 --> 00:24:06,341
of a free-range 11-year-old boy.

386
00:24:06,361 --> 00:24:15,308
It’s like waking up on a flight,
and noticing the engines just quit.

387
00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:18,186
And I start bolting through the
house, I get to his room,

388
00:24:18,206 --> 00:24:19,771
I was like “DAAAAAAAAAAAAHHH!”

389
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:21,322
And you know when I found him?

390
00:24:21,342 --> 00:24:25,527
I wish to God he was doing
something diabolical, evil…

391
00:24:25,547 --> 00:24:28,738
building a bomb, worshiping Satan...
something.

392
00:24:28,758 --> 00:24:32,279
Cuz at least then I know he was doing
something productive AAAAAAAAAND

393
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:35,829
he’s gonna be the leader
of the prison gang.

394
00:24:35,849 --> 00:24:40,083
“What’s your son doing?”
“He’s running Chino.”

395
00:24:40,103 --> 00:24:42,419
That’s a conversation

396
00:24:42,439 --> 00:24:45,755
that I’m willing to have with
somebody if that’s where it ends up.

397
00:24:45,775 --> 00:24:48,633
INSTEAD, I look into my son’s room,
he’s standing in the middle of the room

398
00:24:48,653 --> 00:24:49,552
simply doing this –

399
00:24:49,572 --> 00:24:53,492
“ ”

400
00:25:08,507 --> 00:25:10,835
What the Hell is he doing?
“What are you doing?

401
00:25:10,855 --> 00:25:13,171
What are you getting ready for an
early 20’s crystal meth addiction?

402
00:25:13,191 --> 00:25:18,205
What is that?”

403
00:25:18,225 --> 00:25:22,876
I look down, still no pants.

404
00:25:22,896 --> 00:25:26,505
But progress has been made.

405
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:28,715
And this happened.

406
00:25:28,735 --> 00:25:32,197
My son is NOW,
wearing TWO pair of underwear.

407
00:25:36,993 --> 00:25:39,935
I don’t have a context
for that conversation.

408
00:25:39,955 --> 00:25:42,609
I can’t even sit down and
give him a Dad life lesson.

409
00:25:42,629 --> 00:25:46,483
“I remember when I put on
two pair of underwear…”

410
00:25:46,503 --> 00:25:47,567
I – I – I just went…

411
00:25:47,587 --> 00:25:52,697
“You get, what the f—ahhh.

412
00:25:52,717 --> 00:25:55,659
Wow. Don’t you have nerve
endings in your ass?

413
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:58,486
You didn’t notice that you
put underwear over underwear?

414
00:25:58,506 --> 00:26:01,164
And just because you put
underwear over underwear

415
00:26:01,184 --> 00:26:03,582
doesn’t make the second
pair of underwear pants,

416
00:26:03,602 --> 00:26:05,460
oh my God,

417
00:26:05,480 --> 00:26:08,922
what does this special school cost??
Jesus.

418
00:26:08,942 --> 00:26:14,739
I can’t spell
Montessori, God Jesus.

419
00:26:21,496 --> 00:26:24,207
AND WHAT IS THAT SMELL?!”

420
00:26:26,501 --> 00:26:29,461
That smell, I swear I wasn’t
gonna be one of those parents.

421
00:26:29,481 --> 00:26:33,613
Everyone has a friend who had
too many kids – they regret it.

422
00:26:33,633 --> 00:26:38,660
And when you go to their house, it
always smells like they are cooking eggs.

423
00:26:38,680 --> 00:26:40,976
“Would you guys like to
eat out on the patio?”

424
00:26:40,996 --> 00:26:43,164
“Please. Thank you.”

425
00:26:43,184 --> 00:26:45,125
And I wasn’t gonna be that
– they had just given up.

426
00:26:45,145 --> 00:26:46,085
You could tell they
had just given up.

427
00:26:46,105 --> 00:26:54,092
That their house is gonna smell like that
until everyone leaves and they… burn it down.

428
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:55,260
And I wasn’t gonna
be that parent.

429
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:57,345
So the first time that it happened, I went
in his room and I went through everything.

430
00:26:57,365 --> 00:26:59,556
I went through his drawers,
I went through his closet and “Ha-HA!”

431
00:26:59,576 --> 00:27:01,891
I couldn’t find the smell.

432
00:27:01,911 --> 00:27:06,688
I WISH there was a 12-inch
human turd under his bed.

433
00:27:06,708 --> 00:27:09,399
Cuz then I could go “VICTORY!
I HAVE FOUND THE SMELL!

434
00:27:09,419 --> 00:27:14,007
Get the hazmat suits and the
bleach and then we shall dance!”

435
00:27:16,968 --> 00:27:18,491
Instead I just walked out

436
00:27:18,511 --> 00:27:22,807
“Why… how does it soak into latex?
It’s impossible, oh my God.”

437
00:27:24,017 --> 00:27:27,042
If you have kids – that smell – if
you have boys especially – UUGHH.

438
00:27:27,062 --> 00:27:29,492
Girls have it too.
My daughter has a weird thing.

439
00:27:29,512 --> 00:27:32,472
Her room looks great,
but you open her closet and it’s like

440
00:27:32,492 --> 00:27:34,299
HEHHHRRAGGHHH “Ok, alright.

441
00:27:34,319 --> 00:27:39,387
Your clothes have fumes, honey.
They shouldn’t have fuuumes.”

442
00:27:39,407 --> 00:27:42,515
The smell is worse than a
hospital, or a nursing home,

443
00:27:42,535 --> 00:27:44,851
or a, or a death camp.

444
00:27:44,871 --> 00:27:48,271
Like, I could save some people from
Dachau, hide in my son’s room

445
00:27:48,291 --> 00:27:51,900
“Stay here,
the nazis’ll never get you here!”

446
00:27:51,920 --> 00:27:53,910
And after about 10
minutes they would go

447
00:27:53,930 --> 00:27:57,976
“You know,
we’re gonna go back to the camp.

448
00:28:01,888 --> 00:28:04,329
Do you smell that? Uhhehh

449
00:28:04,349 --> 00:28:06,768
Eckhhhh.
I think I need a shower. Eh.”

450
00:28:09,396 --> 00:28:10,377
No

451
00:28:10,397 --> 00:28:12,879
No. No.

452
00:28:12,899 --> 00:28:15,090
Nooo.

453
00:28:15,110 --> 00:28:16,110
No.

454
00:28:16,611 --> 00:28:19,155
Don’t you “ew” that – that
joke tracks perfectly.

455
00:28:21,199 --> 00:28:24,191
I put ‘em in my son’s room –
they smelt something horrible –

456
00:28:24,211 --> 00:28:26,405
they felt disgusting –
they needed a shower.

457
00:28:26,425 --> 00:28:28,687
But then YOU GUYS

458
00:28:28,707 --> 00:28:30,125
added history.

459
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:34,567
Yeah. That’s on you bitches.

460
00:28:34,587 --> 00:28:37,195
As a matter of fact “Oooooh.

461
00:28:37,215 --> 00:28:39,322
OOOOOh. Yeah. Ohhhhh.

462
00:28:39,342 --> 00:28:42,617
Yeah. I’m a little disappointed
in all of you, frankly.

463
00:28:42,637 --> 00:28:45,056
Yeah, yeah. How’s that feel?”

464
00:28:48,852 --> 00:28:50,500
To you people that do not have
children, listen up,

465
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:53,712
cool Uncle Titus is gonna
help you out right now.

466
00:28:53,732 --> 00:28:58,717
Between 1 and 18,
a child’s gonna cost you roughly $300,000.

467
00:28:58,737 --> 00:28:59,801
Uh-huh. Yeah.

468
00:28:59,821 --> 00:29:01,913
Do you know what you
can get for $300,000?

469
00:29:01,933 --> 00:29:04,514
A Lamborghini.

470
00:29:04,534 --> 00:29:06,932
Do you know what you can
get with a Lamborghini?

471
00:29:06,952 --> 00:29:09,352
Anything you want.

472
00:29:09,372 --> 00:29:10,729
Are you kidding me, man?

473
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:14,608
You got a Lamborghini, park in front of
any restaurant or store in this town,

474
00:29:14,628 --> 00:29:16,819
“Park it right here, sir. We’re
gonnawipe it down while you’re inside.

475
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:20,905
Get that man a glass of champagne,
for he haaasss aaaaaaa LAMBORGHINI!!”

476
00:29:20,925 --> 00:29:23,491
Pull up to a job interview
in a Lamborghini. Vvvrrroom.

477
00:29:23,511 --> 00:29:24,784
“You’re obviously
management potential.

478
00:29:24,804 --> 00:29:26,870
Please go talk to the boss,
we’re gonna give you the corner office

479
00:29:26,890 --> 00:29:29,914
because you have
aaaaaaa LAMBORGHINI!"

480
00:29:29,934 --> 00:29:32,876
Gentlemen, you’re driving a
Lamborghini, who's sitting next to you?

481
00:29:32,896 --> 00:29:36,337
Way-out-of-your-league-chick,
that’s who’s sitting next to you.

482
00:29:36,357 --> 00:29:38,500
Smokin’ body, she got
money, she got class,

483
00:29:38,520 --> 00:29:41,843
she doesn’t like you,
but you have aaaaaaaaa LAMBORGHINI!!!

484
00:29:41,863 --> 00:29:43,928
And you’re living the
Lamborghini life, man.

485
00:29:43,948 --> 00:29:45,346
VVvvvvrrrooomVVrrrrmmmmVvvvvrrrr.

486
00:29:45,366 --> 00:29:46,848
Doing what you
want, when you want.

487
00:29:46,868 --> 00:29:49,517
Stayin’ up all night and getting’ up
early because you’re not tired at all.

488
00:29:49,537 --> 00:29:51,394
That’s right. Because you know
what a Lamborghini doesn’t have?

489
00:29:51,414 --> 00:29:56,065
A FUCKING CAR SEAT.
THAT’S WHAT IT DOESN’T HAVE.

490
00:29:56,085 --> 00:30:00,465
THAT’S WHAT IT DOESN’T HAVE.

491
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:05,659
Drivin’ through town just…

492
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,344
VVvvvvrrrrrooomVVvvrrrrVrrrVrrrr.

493
00:30:07,364 --> 00:30:10,222
Driving past parents in
mini-vans with bald tired because

494
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:14,000
“Connor needs braces”

495
00:30:14,020 --> 00:30:19,609
and they’re watching you drive by
like starving African children.

496
00:30:24,113 --> 00:30:26,554
Flies buzzing around their head…

497
00:30:26,574 --> 00:30:31,017
because WHAT IS THAT SMELL?

498
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:33,691
Because you’re out there
living the Lamborghini life.

499
00:30:33,711 --> 00:30:38,942
Doing crazy stuff. Taking vacations
that actually feel like vacations.

500
00:30:38,962 --> 00:30:41,616
Ahhhh, you’re staying in
the top floor of the resort,

501
00:30:41,636 --> 00:30:45,615
in the kids-not-allowed suite – I’ve
been there once, it was INCREDIBLE.

502
00:30:45,635 --> 00:30:47,268
Out on the balcony with the one.

503
00:30:47,288 --> 00:30:49,953
$60 bottle of pinot noir

504
00:30:49,973 --> 00:30:52,539
“This is an amazing life,
I love you, you love me.”

505
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:55,959
And then 18 rooms down the hotel…
Waaaaay in the distance you hear

506
00:30:55,979 --> 00:30:59,420
“GOD DAMMIT BRIAN,
STOP JUMPING ON THE BED!!!

507
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:01,277
WHO SAID YOU COULD
OPEN THE MINI BAR?

508
00:31:01,297 --> 00:31:04,925
$32 CASHEWS?!
YOU KIDS ARE KILLING ME!”

509
00:31:08,491 --> 00:31:12,141
“That is never gonna be us.”

510
00:31:12,161 --> 00:31:14,866
“Let’s go in that room and
have some Lamborghini sex –

511
00:31:14,886 --> 00:31:16,688
AAAAUUUUGGGhhhh

512
00:31:16,708 --> 00:31:18,106
And you go in that room and
you take off your clothes and

513
00:31:18,126 --> 00:31:21,985
you still look good 'cause you don’t
have the stress-fat that kids give ya,

514
00:31:22,005 --> 00:31:26,030
and you leave the door open because
NOBODY’S GONNA WALK IN ON YA.

515
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:28,157
And you get out the ropes and
the chains and the lava lamp and

516
00:31:28,177 --> 00:31:31,578
YOU’RE DOIN’ IT LIKE YOU WANNA DO
IT, YEAH. YEAH.

517
00:31:31,598 --> 00:31:33,129
Ride this more than 8 seconds!

518
00:31:33,149 --> 00:31:34,149
WOOOOO!

519
00:31:34,934 --> 00:31:36,249
YES!

520
00:31:36,269 --> 00:31:38,877
Yes! Makin’ noises
from Cro-Magnon times –

521
00:31:38,897 --> 00:31:42,066
HERRRAAAAUAUUUGHHH!

522
00:31:52,536 --> 00:31:53,517
BUT…

523
00:31:53,537 --> 00:31:58,813
you drank too much and forgot
to be careful that night.

524
00:31:58,833 --> 00:32:00,619
Now the Lamborghini’s
on Craigslist.

525
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:05,737
And you’ve burned through that
Lamborghini money like THAT, you know why?

526
00:32:05,757 --> 00:32:10,298
Because the kid has allergies and needs meds,
and a tutor, cuz he’s missed so much school,

527
00:32:10,318 --> 00:32:14,030
and you can’t have a damn
PEANUT in your house ever again.

528
00:32:16,225 --> 00:32:18,499
Yeaaaah. And now that amazing relationship you
had where you guys did EVERYTHING together,

529
00:32:18,519 --> 00:32:24,380
now, you’re still doing that, but now it’s
getting’ fat and losin’ your hair “WEEEEEEEEEE!”

530
00:32:24,400 --> 00:32:28,426
And you’re going to sleep
before the nightclub opens.

531
00:32:28,446 --> 00:32:31,554
And your friends that don’t have
kids won’t come over anymore.

532
00:32:31,574 --> 00:32:33,462
“You guys wanna come
over for dinner?”

533
00:32:33,482 --> 00:32:35,016
“UH. NO. We…

534
00:32:35,036 --> 00:32:37,538
hafta… go to… Canada.”

535
00:32:43,753 --> 00:32:46,402
And you gotta take a job
you hate down at the Mill

536
00:32:46,422 --> 00:32:49,906
cuz you’re living in a
Bruce Springsteen song now.

537
00:32:49,926 --> 00:32:55,036
And not the first verse,
the third verse, where it gets weird.

538
00:32:55,056 --> 00:32:56,245
And every morning,
you leave at 4 a.m.

539
00:32:56,265 --> 00:32:58,164
you leave for work with
your tiny little lunch box,

540
00:32:58,184 --> 00:33:02,961
but you always glance back at the electric
guitar you bought right before she got pregnant.

541
00:33:02,981 --> 00:33:07,840
Behind that, fading into the wallpaper with
the rest of your crushed hopes and dreams.

542
00:33:07,860 --> 00:33:11,886
And now… you gotta start
hanging out with other parents.

543
00:33:11,906 --> 00:33:14,806
Ahhhhhhh.

544
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:18,476
The most unreasonable
group of delusional humps

545
00:33:18,496 --> 00:33:20,937
I have ever met in my life.

546
00:33:20,957 --> 00:33:25,396
Some of you are in here tonight. That’s why
that joke got a little bit of subdued laugh.

547
00:33:25,416 --> 00:33:28,444
“I’m not delusional.”
Yeah, you are, holy shit.

548
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:29,570
And you’re out there with
them, you know.

549
00:33:29,590 --> 00:33:31,280
They’ve also balled up
their hopes and dreams.

550
00:33:31,300 --> 00:33:34,242
Instead of tossing them away like you
did, they took their hopes and dreams

551
00:33:34,262 --> 00:33:36,911
and started RAMMIN’ THEM DOWN
THEIR KIDS’ THROATS, YEAH.

552
00:33:36,931 --> 00:33:38,871
“You’re going to soccer camp
three times a year because

553
00:33:38,891 --> 00:33:40,832
DADDY DIDN’T GET
TO PLAY IN COLLEGE!

554
00:33:40,852 --> 00:33:43,187
Ha Ha Ha Ha.”

555
00:33:44,605 --> 00:33:46,136
And you’re out there with ‘em.

556
00:33:46,156 --> 00:33:48,006
You know,
your kids on the team too,

557
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:54,470
and you LOOOOOVE gettin’ up at 7 a.m.
on a Saturday WEEEEEEE!

558
00:33:54,490 --> 00:34:02,562
And I’m just out there – “God,
please… I hope somebody breaks a tibia.”

559
00:34:02,582 --> 00:34:08,693
I don’t even care if it’s my kid because then
we won’t have to come back next Saturday.

560
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,195
And while you’re standing there,
praying for it to be over, that one dude

561
00:34:11,215 --> 00:34:14,583
“You see my little Brian out there?
He’s amazing, you see my Brian?

562
00:34:14,603 --> 00:34:16,826
He’s badass… BADASSSSS!!

563
00:34:16,846 --> 00:34:18,479
Kids’ gonna be in
the world cup.”

564
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:25,460
“The kid that just ran full-speed
into the goal post? That kid?”

565
00:34:25,480 --> 00:34:29,464
“Yeah, he always gives 110
percent – 110 PERCEEEEENNNT!!”

566
00:34:29,484 --> 00:34:33,515
“Hey, did you guys see my little Stanley?
He’s a badass, gonna play in the NFL.”

567
00:34:33,535 --> 00:34:35,928
“Hahahaha.
Stanley weighs like 17 pounds.”

568
00:34:35,948 --> 00:34:39,827
“Hey hey hey hey,
Stanley’s life coach said –

569
00:34:43,998 --> 00:34:46,814
don’t talk about
Stanley’s weight.”

570
00:34:46,834 --> 00:34:49,520
“Oh my God, did you see my
little Tanya’s test scores?

571
00:34:49,540 --> 00:34:51,855
She is amazing.
Oh my God, Tanya, oh my God.

572
00:34:51,875 --> 00:34:54,801
That little girl is
gonna work for NASA.”

573
00:34:56,302 --> 00:34:59,660
“Nobody’s gonna tell her?

574
00:34:59,680 --> 00:35:03,289
Uh… N-No,
she’s not gonna work for NASA.

575
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:06,667
We’ve all known Tanya for
about four years now and, and,

576
00:35:06,687 --> 00:35:11,025
we’re pretty sure… Tanya’s gonna
leave a baby in a dumpster.

577
00:35:19,367 --> 00:35:23,768
Cuz you guys have dressed her like
a tiny hooker since she was two.

578
00:35:23,788 --> 00:35:27,939
And my kids can’t stop watching her
because he’s obviously a FOLLOWER.

579
00:35:27,959 --> 00:35:31,254
PAY ATTENTION TO THE
GAME, IDIOT!”

580
00:35:34,048 --> 00:35:37,698
And you do your best, parents. Everyone,
every parent in this room is doing their best.

581
00:35:37,718 --> 00:35:39,951
And if you get ‘em to 18, yes!
You get to kick ‘em out!

582
00:35:39,971 --> 00:35:41,757
And you never have
to see ‘em again!

583
00:35:41,777 --> 00:35:44,372
Hahahaha.

584
00:35:44,392 --> 00:35:47,416
Hahahahaaahahahahahaa.

585
00:35:47,436 --> 00:35:49,794
I’m sorry,
I couldn’t stop laughing.

586
00:35:49,814 --> 00:35:52,255
Yeah, they go away
for a little while.

587
00:35:52,275 --> 00:35:56,306
But then at 19 and a half you get a phone
call from the local police department.

588
00:35:56,326 --> 00:35:58,469
“Mr. Titus,
we’ve arrested your son…

589
00:35:58,489 --> 00:36:02,702
and his girlfriend Tanya…

590
00:36:04,537 --> 00:36:07,061
for drug trafficking.”

591
00:36:07,081 --> 00:36:08,521
“WHAT?” You go to the jail –

592
00:36:08,541 --> 00:36:11,348
“Drug trafficking?
What the Hell were you doing, idiot?”

593
00:36:11,368 --> 00:36:16,779
“UH, me and Tanya went to Mexico,
and she met this guy with a backpack

594
00:36:16,799 --> 00:36:20,052
and .”

595
00:36:31,564 --> 00:36:34,830
And I’m at the front desk filling
out paperwork, bailing him out,

596
00:36:34,850 --> 00:36:37,925
the cop goes “We know
your son’s an idiot.

597
00:36:37,945 --> 00:36:40,595
He didn’t do anything wrong. He helped
us catch the drug dealer, though,

598
00:36:40,615 --> 00:36:42,513
we caught the drug dealer cuz of h-
yeah, we impounded his car,

599
00:36:42,533 --> 00:36:45,442
you should check it out.” And
you glance at an impound and

600
00:36:45,462 --> 00:36:48,811
THERE’S YOUR LAMBORGHINI
FROM TWENTY YEARS AGO.

601
00:36:48,831 --> 00:36:50,813
And the cop goes “That thing’s
like 20 years old, it’s a classic,

602
00:36:50,833 --> 00:36:54,253
it’s worth like 1.2
million dollars now.”

603
00:37:03,304 --> 00:37:05,286
"Um...

604
00:37:05,306 --> 00:37:09,457
where do you guys
keep the extra guns?

605
00:37:09,477 --> 00:37:12,335
And can I talk to my
kid one more time?

606
00:37:12,355 --> 00:37:18,424
Cuz I love him so much.”

607
00:37:18,444 --> 00:37:22,303
Now, granted,
that’s worse-case-scenario. BUT,

608
00:37:22,323 --> 00:37:24,180
I have two, I have two children.

609
00:37:24,200 --> 00:37:25,527
I stopped at two children,

610
00:37:25,547 --> 00:37:28,675
because my ex-wife’s
vagina was busy elsewhere.

611
00:37:37,129 --> 00:37:41,155
It had a guest list and I wasn’t on it.
There ya go.

612
00:37:41,175 --> 00:37:45,359
You can ‘Ooh’ that joke all you want but
I could say a lot meaner s tuff than that.

613
00:37:45,379 --> 00:37:48,871
Instead I chose to use
the King’s English.

614
00:37:48,891 --> 00:37:52,250
“HER VAGINA WAS BUSY ELSEWHERE.

615
00:37:52,270 --> 00:37:57,525
HER WIZARD SLEEVE WAS FILLED WITH
THE WANDS OF OTHER SORCERERS.”

616
00:38:05,408 --> 00:38:08,577
When I call someone a cheating
bitch, I do it classy!

617
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:16,399
Be careful who you marry, people.
Make good choices.

618
00:38:16,419 --> 00:38:19,110
When you get married,
make REALLY REALLY good choices.

619
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:20,361
You know. You know something
else weird about that?

620
00:38:20,381 --> 00:38:21,946
I found out she was cheating on me.
I found out on a Friday.

621
00:38:21,966 --> 00:38:23,406
I was in court by Tuesday.

622
00:38:23,426 --> 00:38:26,947
Because I’m a knee-jerk person.
I just, I filed for divorce instantly.

623
00:38:26,967 --> 00:38:31,289
I just react. Cuz my dad had a
good jab and you had to move.

624
00:38:31,309 --> 00:38:33,416
And I went to court that Tuesday. It was
like, literally four or five days later

625
00:38:33,436 --> 00:38:35,167
“I WANT A DIVORCE!” Cuz my
– the switch got flipped.

626
00:38:35,187 --> 00:38:36,919
You know in a relationship,
switch flip, “I want a divorce!”

627
00:38:36,939 --> 00:38:39,380
And this woman stood
up, IN COURT, and said

628
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:42,188
“Your honor, this man’s been
beating me for twenty years

629
00:38:42,208 --> 00:38:45,149
and beating the children
since the day they were born.”

630
00:38:45,169 --> 00:38:48,200
Now,
let’s deal with the first one.

631
00:38:50,077 --> 00:38:53,019
If YOUUUUU let me BEAT YOU

632
00:38:53,039 --> 00:38:56,022
for TWENTY YEARS,

633
00:38:56,042 --> 00:38:58,941
THAT’S not abuse.

634
00:38:58,961 --> 00:39:01,422
That’s a fetish.

635
00:39:07,428 --> 00:39:09,452
But then she lied again and
said I beat my children.

636
00:39:09,472 --> 00:39:12,038
So I spent every dime I ever
made on my fine television show

637
00:39:12,058 --> 00:39:14,081
and I spent every dime I’ve
made in comedy for six years,

638
00:39:14,101 --> 00:39:15,583
and I PROVED after six years
that it NEVER happened.

639
00:39:15,603 --> 00:39:17,543
But, to this day, like 9 years
later, she’ll be like

640
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:19,503
“Can I have the kids an extra day,
I’ll bring them home on time.”

641
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:21,464
I’m like “No you won’t,
you cheating liar.” And she always goes

642
00:39:21,484 --> 00:39:25,426
“Oh my God,
are you still talking about THAT?

643
00:39:25,446 --> 00:39:29,388
That is in the past,
when are you gonna let that go?”

644
00:39:29,408 --> 00:39:31,057
My answer always is

645
00:39:31,077 --> 00:39:35,498
“When the Jews let it go.”

646
00:39:45,633 --> 00:39:48,552
It’s gonna be a minute.

647
00:39:51,347 --> 00:39:53,704
Be careful who you
marry, be careful!

648
00:39:53,724 --> 00:39:55,498
Be careful!
Pick well, pick well!

649
00:39:55,518 --> 00:39:57,375
Don’t get married FAST.
People get married so fast, too.

650
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,835
“Oh, we knew each other 18 months,
we got married, it’s gonna be great.”

651
00:39:59,855 --> 00:40:03,005
“Did you really risk THAT MUCH? Did you go to
Vegas, put everything on Red, too? Did you?

652
00:40:03,025 --> 00:40:07,051
Wow. Did you fly Southwest to Vegas
and just REALLY risk it all, did ya?

653
00:40:07,071 --> 00:40:14,475
When you landed, did you eat at Chipotle burrito?
Just fucking go for it, if you’re gonna live…”

654
00:40:14,495 --> 00:40:16,936
You can’t know somebody after 2 years!
In two years?

655
00:40:16,956 --> 00:40:18,145
You can’t know anybody
after two years.

656
00:40:18,165 --> 00:40:20,022
You know why? Your brain for the
first 2 years of a relationship,

657
00:40:20,042 --> 00:40:23,275
is producing a chemical that’s like
heroine. That’s why you feel like that.

658
00:40:23,295 --> 00:40:25,361
Look at your behavior when you first
meet somebody and fall in love.

659
00:40:25,381 --> 00:40:28,239
What do you do? You go out and you
get cheeseburgers. You come back,

660
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:30,574
you have sex for 4 hours,
then you go out and get frozen yogurt.

661
00:40:30,594 --> 00:40:33,911
Then you go back and have sex for 4
hours, then you call into work

662
00:40:33,931 --> 00:40:39,125
while you’re still
inside somebody,

663
00:40:39,145 --> 00:40:41,339
then you go out and
have cheeseburgers again

664
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:46,507
– THAT’S CRACKHEAD BEHAVIOR
– THAT’S WHAT THAT IS.

665
00:40:46,527 --> 00:40:48,753
But nobody tells you that.
No one tells you –

666
00:40:48,773 --> 00:40:50,559
“Oh, it’s gonna be
great, you know.”

667
00:40:50,579 --> 00:40:54,765
Cuz once you’re married, that heroine
feeling doesn’t last all day anymore.

668
00:40:54,785 --> 00:40:58,561
At most – AT MOST – you
get 15 minutes a day.

669
00:40:58,581 --> 00:41:04,108
And you spend 23 hours and 45
minutes trying to get the next fix.

670
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:06,402
Why do you think
flower shops exist?

671
00:41:06,422 --> 00:41:09,155
It’s expensive dead plants.

672
00:41:09,175 --> 00:41:13,659
“Here you go,
baby.” “Oh my God.” “YEEEAAAAAAH.”

673
00:41:13,679 --> 00:41:19,665
Gentlemen – every woman in this room knows
that fishnet stockings keep nobody warm.

674
00:41:19,685 --> 00:41:24,523
“YEAH THEY DO.”

675
00:41:26,734 --> 00:41:29,091
It takes eight years
to know somebody.

676
00:41:29,111 --> 00:41:34,825
And I know a lot of us are thinking – “Wow,
I can’t hold the crazy back that long.”

677
00:41:41,415 --> 00:41:44,190
But you have to – you have to.

678
00:41:44,210 --> 00:41:47,193
Because two-year-relationship-you,
is not eight-year-relationship-you

679
00:41:47,213 --> 00:41:49,028
Two-year-relationship-you is…

680
00:41:49,048 --> 00:41:52,448
gentlemen, you’re in the car with her – two-year-relationship-you,
get cut off by a psychopath, what do you do?

681
00:41:52,468 --> 00:41:57,703
“Oh my God,
look at this silly son of a bitch.

682
00:41:57,723 --> 00:42:04,001
How goofy is that, right? Wow. Let’s
go to Dairy Queen and get a blizzard.”

683
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:06,624
Eight-year-relationship-you,
same guy cuts you off,"

684
00:42:06,644 --> 00:42:09,021
“MOTHERFUCK—GET ME MY
SHOTGUN, RIGHT NOW!!”

685
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:10,360
CHHHH-CHHHH.

686
00:42:11,403 --> 00:42:13,385
“Oh my God.”

687
00:42:13,405 --> 00:42:14,528
“What are you doing?!”

688
00:42:14,548 --> 00:42:16,805
“Texting my mom
about the wedding.

689
00:42:16,825 --> 00:42:22,645
No, we’re still gonna get married, I’m
just gonna go with a Kevlar theme, now.”

690
00:42:22,665 --> 00:42:25,829
Ladies, what are you laughing about?
Two-year-relationship-you?

691
00:42:25,849 --> 00:42:27,942
We LOOOOOOOVE two-year-
relationship-you.

692
00:42:27,962 --> 00:42:29,860
Two-year-relationship-you
is amazing.

693
00:42:29,880 --> 00:42:33,405
“You going to Vegas with your buddies?
Well, just go have a good time.

694
00:42:33,425 --> 00:42:35,866
Don’t even take your phone – what
happens in Vegas, stays in Vegas,

695
00:42:35,886 --> 00:42:37,409
I don’t care…

696
00:42:37,429 --> 00:42:40,579
Go, just go!”

697
00:42:40,599 --> 00:42:44,270
“I love you,
you love meee yaaa.”

698
00:42:47,773 --> 00:42:49,253
Eight-year-relationship-you –

699
00:42:57,700 --> 00:43:00,995
“Where WERE you?”

700
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,999
“You sent me to Rite Aid.”

701
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:15,656
“27 minutes ago.

702
00:43:15,676 --> 00:43:21,015
And I said the ones
without wings…”

703
00:43:30,733 --> 00:43:32,464
Pick well, man, pick well.

704
00:43:32,484 --> 00:43:35,843
You know it’s funny, your parents want,
everyone wants you to get married.

705
00:43:35,863 --> 00:43:37,803
Everybody wants you to get married.
That’s why people rush into it –

706
00:43:37,823 --> 00:43:38,763
because you were pushing ‘em.

707
00:43:38,783 --> 00:43:41,998
“Oh my God, are you going to make
my daughter and honest woman?”

708
00:43:42,018 --> 00:43:45,939
“No, I prefer the untrustworthy
whore I have now, thank you.”

709
00:43:50,294 --> 00:43:52,568
“You’re gonna make
my son a real man?”

710
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:56,925
“Why? You worried about
the yoga pants too?”

711
00:43:59,303 --> 00:44:01,076
If a mother SEES you
getting along with somebody

712
00:44:01,096 --> 00:44:03,746
“Oh my God, you guys are so cute! They’re
gonna get married! Take the journey…

713
00:44:03,766 --> 00:44:06,373
OH MY GOD TAKE THE JOURNEEEEY!”

714
00:44:06,393 --> 00:44:11,337
They never say “It’s
a fun journey…”

715
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:15,174
And like all journeys you
should strap your ass in.

716
00:44:15,194 --> 00:44:19,345
Because if marriage is a journey,
divorce is a plane crash.

717
00:44:19,365 --> 00:44:22,848
And if you have kids,
it lasts 'til they’re 18 years old.

718
00:44:22,868 --> 00:44:26,287
To you people in here tonight that
got divorced, but never had kids.

719
00:44:26,307 --> 00:44:29,480
I want you to know something
– you didn’t get divorced.

720
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:33,776
You had a long-term booty-call with
paperwork, that’s all that was.

721
00:44:33,796 --> 00:44:37,780
Yeah, that’s all it was. Sorry.

722
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:43,118
Was it hard on ya? To split up the CD’s?
Was that a bitch for you? Was it?

723
00:44:43,138 --> 00:44:50,709
“Oh my God, who’s going to get the Matrix
boxset? We need to hire an arbitrator.”

724
00:44:50,729 --> 00:44:58,904
It is NOT a real divorce until
you shred the chi of an innocent.

725
00:45:02,574 --> 00:45:08,352
“Mommy said my chi used to be
aqua, but daddy made it charcoal.

726
00:45:08,372 --> 00:45:13,148
He lives with my first
grade teacher now.”

727
00:45:13,168 --> 00:45:18,779
That’s a divorce right there.
Ha Ha Ha Ha.

728
00:45:18,799 --> 00:45:20,698
I’ve gotten to a very
sick place with comedy.

729
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,784
I’ve done this so long now – this is my
seventh special – I want you to know something.

730
00:45:23,804 --> 00:45:25,536
So, I WANT you guys to laugh.

731
00:45:25,556 --> 00:45:27,329
And I’m used to that – I’ve
been doing that a long time.

732
00:45:27,349 --> 00:45:28,289
Now I’ve got to
this weird place,

733
00:45:28,309 --> 00:45:30,833
like a guy who’s had way to much
sex where I need it a little weird,

734
00:45:30,853 --> 00:45:32,894
so I write a joke
where, when you guys go

735
00:45:32,914 --> 00:45:35,421
“Ha ha ha… Aaaahhh… Oooooh."

736
00:45:35,441 --> 00:45:37,818
Hhhrrr.

737
00:45:42,781 --> 00:45:48,245
It’s not good – it’s not good.
I have a problem, it’s not good.

738
00:45:52,875 --> 00:45:55,399
Cuz a lot of people do
that to a lot of people…

739
00:45:55,419 --> 00:45:56,982
like a lot of people like, ahh,

740
00:45:57,002 --> 00:46:00,574
“Oh my God, I don’t like you,
we got married too fast, let’s have a kid

741
00:46:00,594 --> 00:46:03,031
so we can slowly destroy
the soul of a child.”

742
00:46:03,051 --> 00:46:05,654
You think a child is going
to fix your relationship?

743
00:46:05,674 --> 00:46:09,788
You’re just strip mining three souls
now, good job, man.

744
00:46:09,808 --> 00:46:12,870
Cuz, by the way, when you have
kids, that heroine thing, like

745
00:46:12,890 --> 00:46:19,214
“Did you cut this with children?

746
00:46:19,234 --> 00:46:22,092
I don’t feel anything at all.

747
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:26,388
I’m tired,
but that’s all I got."

748
00:46:26,408 --> 00:46:28,891
Cuz once you have a
kid, that is for real.

749
00:46:28,911 --> 00:46:31,226
People don’t understand that. People pop
out a kid thinking it’s gonna be fine...

750
00:46:31,246 --> 00:46:34,002
Oh my God. No, man.
If you have a kid, that’s for real.

751
00:46:34,022 --> 00:46:37,065
Once you have a child,
here’s the deal.

752
00:46:37,085 --> 00:46:41,779
You now OWN a human being.

753
00:46:41,799 --> 00:46:43,884
Look at it.

754
00:46:53,769 --> 00:46:58,295
And it does THAT A LOT.

755
00:46:58,315 --> 00:47:02,090
You have now basically created
a totalitarian government

756
00:47:02,110 --> 00:47:06,448
in your own home and that
little fucker is Stalin

757
00:47:11,286 --> 00:47:13,769
It wants what it wants.

758
00:47:13,789 --> 00:47:15,813
It wants it NOW.

759
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:20,879
And you better be movin’.

760
00:47:25,717 --> 00:47:28,262
And then what it does
is also your fault.

761
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:32,454
And there’s no receipt,
you can’t take it back.

762
00:47:32,474 --> 00:47:35,165
And you have one job
as a parent – ONE JOB –

763
00:47:35,185 --> 00:47:37,709
don’t raise
douchebags, that’s it.

764
00:47:37,729 --> 00:47:40,128
That’s it. That’s all there is.
You don’t raise douchebags.

765
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:42,089
If at the end of
18 years your kid

766
00:47:42,109 --> 00:47:46,760
can cook a meal, pay a bill and wipe
his own ass, GOD BLESS YOU, PEOPLE.

767
00:47:46,780 --> 00:47:49,076
That’s all you need.
Can’t do anything anyway.

768
00:47:50,909 --> 00:47:53,475
I’m watching my daughter…

769
00:47:53,495 --> 00:47:55,310
I can’t tell my daughter “You’re
gonna do this… You’re gonna…”

770
00:47:55,330 --> 00:47:57,813
She’s going off on her own,
she’s gonna do what she’s gonna do.

771
00:47:57,833 --> 00:48:00,997
Don’t raise douchebags,
because you don’t want to be the parent

772
00:48:01,017 --> 00:48:05,112
that gets interviewed
after the verdict.

773
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:08,245
“Yeah, I don’t know,
I just thought he liked trench coats. Uh.

774
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:18,604
No, I read his journals,
I thought they were song lyrics.”

775
00:48:32,618 --> 00:48:35,309
Don’t raise douchebags – so you
don’t know how hard it is – again,

776
00:48:35,329 --> 00:48:36,935
cool Uncle Titus is gonna help you
people that don’t have kids yet –

777
00:48:36,955 --> 00:48:38,937
from the second they’re born,
the second they’re born –

778
00:48:38,957 --> 00:48:41,406
all you’re doing – from
the second they’re born –

779
00:48:41,426 --> 00:48:47,237
is downloading life programs
into tiny retarded people.

780
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:50,324
They’re not on the same
operating system you’re on…

781
00:48:50,344 --> 00:48:53,619
their download speed sucks ass…

782
00:48:53,639 --> 00:48:56,663
and there’s a ton
of error messages.

783
00:48:56,683 --> 00:48:58,415
From the second,
the SECOND they’re born –

784
00:48:58,435 --> 00:49:00,167
go to sleep when we tell ya,
take the nipple when you’re supposed to,

785
00:49:00,187 --> 00:49:03,128
coffee tables hurt when you
run into them full speed.

786
00:49:03,148 --> 00:49:06,006
Stitches hurt going
in AND coming out.

787
00:49:06,026 --> 00:49:08,342
Then they get older – do your homework.
Error. Do your homework. Error.

788
00:49:08,362 --> 00:49:11,803
Quit lying. Error. Error.
Error. Error. Error.

789
00:49:11,823 --> 00:49:15,494
Wipe your ass! WIPE YOUR ASS!
WIPE YOUR ASS!!!

790
00:49:19,206 --> 00:49:21,104
Yeah, and that wipe your
ass download as a parent,

791
00:49:21,124 --> 00:49:25,108
as a man you’re gonna be getting
upgrades on that one your whole life.

792
00:49:25,128 --> 00:49:29,905
As a MAN, your last wipe your ass upgrade
will be given to you by your NEW WIFE

793
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:34,388
while you’re standing
in the laundry room

794
00:49:42,312 --> 00:49:46,004
I like that joke cuz it
humiliates everybody.

795
00:49:46,024 --> 00:49:49,069
You see a couple just…

796
00:49:55,409 --> 00:49:57,557
And that’s all you’re doing,
just downloading programs,

797
00:49:57,577 --> 00:49:58,892
constantly,
constantly, constantly.

798
00:49:58,912 --> 00:50:01,603
And the only thing I really enjoyed about having
kids, I really enjoyed for the first 10 years

799
00:50:01,623 --> 00:50:04,889
was, for the first 10 years,
I was the smartest person they knew,

800
00:50:04,909 --> 00:50:07,985
and that’s never happened
in my whole life.

801
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,987
Like, I had an answer,
I knew everything they wanted.

802
00:50:10,007 --> 00:50:11,571
Two little beings had to
ask me – I had an answer.

803
00:50:11,591 --> 00:50:13,734
Even if I was wrong,
they had to believe me

804
00:50:13,754 --> 00:50:16,451
because I control the
food and the shelter.

805
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:18,620
“You don’t think I’m right? How ‘bout
you go stand outside and figure it out?

806
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:19,997
How ‘bout that?

807
00:50:20,017 --> 00:50:22,352
Leave the jacket,
I paid for that.”

808
00:50:25,441 --> 00:50:27,004
For 10 years I knew everything!

809
00:50:27,024 --> 00:50:28,714
I was a genius!
I also got to run them.

810
00:50:28,734 --> 00:50:29,756
If I had a bad day, I could

811
00:50:29,776 --> 00:50:31,925
“Do what I tell you to do because
I’m your father, blah blah blah.”

812
00:50:31,945 --> 00:50:33,468
I had to run them,
I was the dictator of the house.

813
00:50:33,488 --> 00:50:37,389
I got to be the
Hitler of my own home.

814
00:50:37,409 --> 00:50:41,913
And I gotta be honest –
sometimes kinda fun to be Hitler!

815
00:50:47,127 --> 00:50:51,153
Only me and Hitler
have ever said that.

816
00:50:51,173 --> 00:50:53,363
But you were – you get to be,
as dads, you get to be Hitler.

817
00:50:53,383 --> 00:50:55,991
“Clean your room!
Go to bed when I tell you!

818
00:50:56,011 --> 00:50:57,784
Empty the dishwasher!
Invade Poland!

819
00:50:57,804 --> 00:51:01,663
Let’s Do This!”

820
00:51:01,683 --> 00:51:04,796
And if they’re really bad – you
get to lock them in their room

821
00:51:04,816 --> 00:51:06,668
like Hitler did
for a little while.

822
00:51:06,688 --> 00:51:11,214
“You vill stay in zere.

823
00:51:11,234 --> 00:51:14,760
Und you vill give me ze
information I am requesting.

824
00:51:14,780 --> 00:51:17,971
Und you vill stop LYING.

825
00:51:17,991 --> 00:51:21,266
Und if you do zat,
und tell me ze truth…

826
00:51:21,286 --> 00:51:24,853
maybe UND ONLY MAYBE…

827
00:51:24,873 --> 00:51:27,918
you can have a fucking cookie.”

828
00:51:37,677 --> 00:51:40,786
Yeah. Pretty scary voice coming
out of this mug, isn’t it?

829
00:51:40,806 --> 00:51:43,809
“He does that really well.”

830
00:51:45,894 --> 00:51:48,088
And then they get older,
that’s the problem.

831
00:51:48,108 --> 00:51:51,922
When they get older, they start asking
you for upgrades that you don’t have.

832
00:51:51,942 --> 00:51:54,633
And that’s what I didn’t like at all.
10, 11, 12, 13…

833
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:56,927
my son started about 10, we’re
driving home one day and he just goes

834
00:51:56,947 --> 00:52:00,575
“Hey dad, how do rockets work?”

835
00:52:03,537 --> 00:52:08,146
“You know I’m going to San Diego
to tell jokes about you, right?

836
00:52:08,166 --> 00:52:10,357
That’s what I do.

837
00:52:10,377 --> 00:52:12,317
I’m not taking a rocket.

838
00:52:12,337 --> 00:52:16,383
Google it.
It has two K’s that’s all I know.”

839
00:52:17,551 --> 00:52:22,869
Shut up.
I know it doesn’t have to K’s…

840
00:52:22,889 --> 00:52:25,288
And my daughter tooootally
screwed me up bad.

841
00:52:25,308 --> 00:52:28,472
Man, just when I stopped letting
them ask me questions anymore,

842
00:52:28,492 --> 00:52:30,460
I was like “We’re done talking.”

843
00:52:30,480 --> 00:52:32,462
We were home one night,
she was 13 at the time, it was last year,

844
00:52:32,482 --> 00:52:34,881
and we were watching –
the TV was on and uh,

845
00:52:34,901 --> 00:52:36,925
and I have a podcast and we
talk about the world a lot

846
00:52:36,945 --> 00:52:38,885
and so I watch a lot of news and I want
to see what’s going on in the world.

847
00:52:38,905 --> 00:52:41,263
And we’re watching it and
we’re sitting there and uh,

848
00:52:41,283 --> 00:52:43,050
the Ferguson thing was
on, you know…

849
00:52:43,070 --> 00:52:45,761
oh, sorry, no, sorry, it was the Baltimore
thing, the Baltimore thing was on.

850
00:52:45,781 --> 00:52:47,519
Wait – so… no…

851
00:52:47,539 --> 00:52:50,039
it was the North Carolina
thing where that guy got

852
00:52:50,059 --> 00:52:52,816
– no… sorry, sorry,

853
00:52:52,836 --> 00:52:55,360
it was the New Jersey
thing where they… No?

854
00:52:55,380 --> 00:52:57,382
Sorry,
it was the Florida – wait.

855
00:52:59,050 --> 00:53:02,367
No, it was the Louisiana… no,
that was this week. Uhhhm.

856
00:53:02,387 --> 00:53:07,183
All I remember is some black people were getting
soul-raped by bullets – that’s all I remember.

857
00:53:16,401 --> 00:53:22,304
Yeah – this bit’s going
to be uncomfortable.

858
00:53:22,324 --> 00:53:25,182
And I’m making ‘em watch the news,
I’m just making them watch it, you know.

859
00:53:25,202 --> 00:53:28,476
And they wanna watch Spongebob
because they’re so civic-minded.

860
00:53:28,496 --> 00:53:31,104
I’m like going “Shut up, we’re watching
this. Stop it, we’re watching this.”

861
00:53:31,124 --> 00:53:34,024
Cuz I believe you need scars to
survive this world, you know?

862
00:53:34,044 --> 00:53:35,567
You parents that are
raising shiny kids

863
00:53:35,587 --> 00:53:38,445
“Oh my God we block his internet if it has
the word ‘sex’ in it he can’t access it…

864
00:53:38,465 --> 00:53:41,364
even if it’s got an s we don’t
let him get to that, Ugh.

865
00:53:41,384 --> 00:53:45,869
He’s got two channels: he’s
got PBS and PBS Latino.

866
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:50,018
UNO DOS TRES! Ohhhh,

867
00:53:52,979 --> 00:53:56,922
he loves Burt and Ernesto.”

868
00:53:56,942 --> 00:54:00,008
So, yeah.
And by the way, those kids?

869
00:54:00,028 --> 00:54:02,886
Those kids you’re raising?
They’re gonna be shiny.

870
00:54:02,906 --> 00:54:04,179
They’re gonna be great kids.

871
00:54:04,199 --> 00:54:06,240
High self-esteem,
not afraid of anything,

872
00:54:06,260 --> 00:54:08,808
prolly get scholarships to
Ivy League Universities.

873
00:54:08,828 --> 00:54:11,978
And then at 18 you’re going to
send them off into the world –

874
00:54:11,998 --> 00:54:13,647
and they’re gonna get hit by a
bus because you didn’t teach them

875
00:54:13,667 --> 00:54:17,651
THE WORLD IS DANGEROUS.

876
00:54:17,671 --> 00:54:20,946
You need scars! You need scars!

877
00:54:20,966 --> 00:54:24,449
Scare ‘em, a little bit!

878
00:54:24,469 --> 00:54:27,577
My dad did not have a
child-worship thing AT ALL.

879
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:30,330
I went where he went and I
better shut the Hell up about it.

880
00:54:30,350 --> 00:54:32,916
When I was six years old,
he took me with his date

881
00:54:32,936 --> 00:54:36,461
to a drive-in movie theater to see
a Clint Eastwood Dirty Harry movie

882
00:54:36,481 --> 00:54:38,421
called Magnum Force.

883
00:54:38,441 --> 00:54:42,759
YEAH.
I was wearing FEETIE PAJAMAS!

884
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:45,553
And in the first three minutes of
this movie, a dude in a cop uniform,

885
00:54:45,573 --> 00:54:47,869
a guy I’ve been taught
to trust my whole life,

886
00:54:47,889 --> 00:54:49,849
kicks in a door and
shoots two people

887
00:54:49,869 --> 00:54:53,645
having naked bushy 70’s sex…

888
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,522
the dude falls off the bed.

889
00:54:55,542 --> 00:55:00,652
The woman turns - full-boob-shot.
I went through puberty at SIX!!

890
00:55:00,672 --> 00:55:02,696
Then, he shoots her in the boob.

891
00:55:02,716 --> 00:55:08,326
So now I gotta buy weird
magazines the rest of my life.

892
00:55:08,346 --> 00:55:13,999
THEN, then she falls out a window
and bleeds out into a pool.

893
00:55:14,019 --> 00:55:19,441
I went into that movie six years
old, I came out SMOKING.

894
00:55:22,110 --> 00:55:26,386
“Yeah, that was a nice piece of
cinema, daddy. I enjoyed that a lot.

895
00:55:26,406 --> 00:55:29,927
I do have to say, that although Clint
Eastwood’s anti-hero is violent,

896
00:55:29,947 --> 00:55:32,559
it’s just a
reflection of society.

897
00:55:32,579 --> 00:55:36,457
Now I’d like to go home and burn my
Dr. Seuss books because there is no God.”

898
00:55:41,046 --> 00:55:47,407
I’m gonna be seven in a couple
months, I was done with whimsy anyway.

899
00:55:47,427 --> 00:55:48,575
Not the worse one.

900
00:55:48,595 --> 00:55:52,120
My mom was mentally ill, in and out
of mental institutions my whole life.

901
00:55:52,140 --> 00:55:54,539
So between the ages of when I was
8 and 12 she was out for a while.

902
00:55:54,559 --> 00:55:58,182
At 9 years old, we go to the drive-in
movie theater, just me and my mom,

903
00:55:58,202 --> 00:56:02,630
and we see a movie called One
Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest.

904
00:56:02,650 --> 00:56:06,301
Yeah… yeah. I think for mom it
was a research trip of some sort.

905
00:56:06,321 --> 00:56:08,887
And I’m just a kid watching a movie.
I’m just sitting there watching the movie

906
00:56:08,907 --> 00:56:11,918
and it’s the scene where
Nicholson’s getting shock treatment

907
00:56:11,938 --> 00:56:14,225
– and I look over –
my mom is sobbing.

908
00:56:14,245 --> 00:56:16,592
And I go “Mom,
what’s the matter?” And she goes

909
00:56:16,612 --> 00:56:20,574
“That’s what they did to me.”

910
00:56:28,259 --> 00:56:32,389
“Did you get to meet
Jack Nicholson?”

911
00:56:39,777 --> 00:56:41,544
So we’re watching
the Ferguson thing

912
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,129
and it’s going off, man,
it’s just going off and eh

913
00:56:43,149 --> 00:56:45,715
people are screaming and
burn - buildings are burning,

914
00:56:45,735 --> 00:56:47,467
cops are shooting bullets at
people, it was crazy,

915
00:56:47,487 --> 00:56:49,052
and then – we’re watching it.

916
00:56:49,072 --> 00:56:51,971
And I FEEL like I’m doing
the right thing as a parent.

917
00:56:51,991 --> 00:56:54,891
I feel like, you know what?
They’re seeing the world as it is, good.

918
00:56:54,911 --> 00:56:57,477
They need to see it so they know
what the world’s like. Alright, good.

919
00:56:57,497 --> 00:57:00,688
And I’m just sittin’ there, not thinking
anything, and my daughter looks up and goes

920
00:57:00,708 --> 00:57:02,732
“Dad?

921
00:57:02,752 --> 00:57:06,464
Why are black people so angry?”

922
00:57:10,009 --> 00:57:14,160
“What channel is Spongebob on?”

923
00:57:14,180 --> 00:57:16,663
Cuz it should be illegal
to ask me that question!

924
00:57:16,683 --> 00:57:18,873
Do you see what color that is?

925
00:57:18,893 --> 00:57:24,337
You can only find that
at a napkin factory.

926
00:57:24,357 --> 00:57:26,041
I wanted to turn
to my kids and go

927
00:57:26,061 --> 00:57:31,344
“Guys, we can’t talk about
this, we’re almost clear.”

928
00:57:31,364 --> 00:57:32,846
But I don’t want to be that
parent, man.

929
00:57:32,866 --> 00:57:35,348
I don’t want to pull the ripcord.
So many parents just pull the ripcord.

930
00:57:35,368 --> 00:57:36,724
You know – it's
like-especially now

931
00:57:36,744 --> 00:57:41,271
“Oh, mommy’s going to take a Xanax, you guys
go play video games, we can’t talk about this…”

932
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:43,731
Or that other show,
man… Beyond Scared Straight.

933
00:57:43,751 --> 00:57:46,067
What a crap-show that is. You know
what pissed me off about that show?

934
00:57:46,087 --> 00:57:48,903
Every parent is the
victim in that show.

935
00:57:48,923 --> 00:57:51,489
“Justin was going to school and
he wasn’t doing what he said,

936
00:57:51,509 --> 00:57:54,784
and he was getting F’s and D’s and he was
selling drugs and he was beating up people,

937
00:57:54,804 --> 00:57:56,703
and he was just horrible,
so I think the best course of action

938
00:57:56,723 --> 00:57:59,038
is to send him to a
maximum security prison so

939
00:57:59,058 --> 00:58:03,605
rapists and murderers can teach him
because I suck that bad as a parent.”

940
00:58:06,232 --> 00:58:10,467
Listen, if your kid ended up
on Beyond Scared Straight–

941
00:58:10,487 --> 00:58:13,094
you fucked up.

942
00:58:13,114 --> 00:58:16,431
And you have no excuse because
there are sporting goods stores

943
00:58:16,451 --> 00:58:20,622
ALLLL over the place and
they’re full of baseball bats.

944
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:26,544
As my dad said,
“Sometimes respect comes from Louisville.”

945
00:58:35,803 --> 00:58:39,913
That joke’s gonna be in court
with my ex-wife, trust me.

946
00:58:39,933 --> 00:58:41,122
So I don’t know what to
say, man.

947
00:58:41,142 --> 00:58:43,625
I’m like - and I don’t want to be
that parent. I want to do my best,

948
00:58:43,645 --> 00:58:46,127
so she asked me, and she’s looking at
me, and the riots going on…

949
00:58:46,147 --> 00:58:48,171
and I’m just like, I like, I,
uhm, I’m gonna Chuck Yeager this,

950
00:58:48,191 --> 00:58:50,006
“Alright honey, alright –

951
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:54,447
why are black people angry? Well, let me
tell you – black people are angry because…

952
00:58:59,661 --> 00:59:02,560
bla... bla... black people
– black – black people.

953
00:59:02,580 --> 00:59:05,396
They’re An-An—Angry.

954
00:59:05,416 --> 00:59:09,234
Because of people like your father,
let’s just be honest, because…

955
00:59:09,254 --> 00:59:13,696
because this exact face has been the face
of the white devil for 500 years now.

956
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:16,741
I guarantee you, honey, you could
open a history book and find this face

957
00:59:16,761 --> 00:59:18,451
on a Sepia-toned garret-type

958
00:59:18,471 --> 00:59:21,737
of a guy standing in front of a
cotton field being photobombed by

959
00:59:21,757 --> 00:59:24,885
three guys hanging from an oak
tree, I’m pretty sure.”

960
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:33,987
Yeah, yeah… read a history
book, it sucks.

961
00:59:36,489 --> 00:59:38,805
But then… and then she
asked me about slavery.

962
00:59:38,825 --> 00:59:42,346
But she doesn’t ask about the history
of slavery, I got that… she goes

963
00:59:42,366 --> 00:59:46,161
“Dad, can you explain to
me the concept of slavery?”

964
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:52,151
Like, Spongebob is one channel
away, right there, one button.

965
00:59:52,171 --> 00:59:54,404
I mean, ask me something that’s easy to
talk about that’s not gonna freak me out

966
00:59:54,424 --> 00:59:59,762
– butt sex, I’ll tell you about that if
you all go – something horrible, really?

967
01:00:03,766 --> 01:00:06,416
“Alright, the concept of slavery.
Ok, oh God,

968
01:00:06,436 --> 01:00:10,712
ahh K, here’s the CONCEPT
of slavery… Uhhhhh, huh…

969
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:15,717
This person who’s black, because
their skin has too much melanin in it…

970
01:00:15,737 --> 01:00:22,223
and this person who’s white, who if they go
outside for 40 minutes turns into a pot-pie…

971
01:00:22,243 --> 01:00:24,642
that’s the difference…
and because of that,

972
01:00:24,662 --> 01:00:27,895
this person gets
to OWN this person.

973
01:00:27,915 --> 01:00:29,606
And THIS person has to do
everything this person says,

974
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,149
because if they don’t,
the job benefits include

975
01:00:31,169 --> 01:00:33,414
whipping,
raping and selling off your family,

976
01:00:33,434 --> 01:00:36,571
which is the worst High
School job fair ever.

977
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:38,906
I wouldn’t even fill
out that application.

978
01:00:38,926 --> 01:00:41,909
Unless it was good health care.”

979
01:00:41,929 --> 01:00:46,080
And I get—she’s just as
uncomfortable as you guys are –

980
01:00:46,100 --> 01:00:49,000
and I get up and I go “And
Lincoln freed the slaves!”

981
01:00:49,020 --> 01:00:51,265
And she goes “So it was
all cool after that.”

982
01:00:57,862 --> 01:00:59,719
“Yeah, kinda like Israel
and Palestine is all cool.”

983
01:00:59,739 --> 01:01:01,831
“What’s going on in
Israel and Palestine?”

984
01:01:01,851 --> 01:01:06,314
“CAN WE JUST WATCH
SPONGEBOB, PLEASE?!”

985
01:01:09,123 --> 01:01:10,688
And I realized –

986
01:01:10,708 --> 01:01:12,273
and you do this as a parent
sometimes – you realize -

987
01:01:12,293 --> 01:01:14,028
“Oh,
I’m digging a hole right now.”

988
01:01:14,048 --> 01:01:18,154
I’ve driven it back a way, and I’m just
digging a hole of stupidity right now.

989
01:01:18,174 --> 01:01:23,409
And I know if I keep talking I’m going to sitting
across from her Principal in a couple of weeks,

990
01:01:23,429 --> 01:01:27,872
“Mr. Titus, did you have a long talk with
your daughter about black people and slavery?

991
01:01:27,892 --> 01:01:31,709
Cuz there was a
riot on Thursday…

992
01:01:31,729 --> 01:01:34,962
and your daughter organized it.”

993
01:01:34,982 --> 01:01:36,756
“NO SHE DID NOT.
What side was she?

994
01:01:36,776 --> 01:01:40,051
She wasn’t doing this, was she?”

995
01:01:40,071 --> 01:01:42,011
“No, no… we have one of her
picket signs right here – it says

996
01:01:42,031 --> 01:01:45,910
‘We’re all pink on the inside like Salmon’.
Did you tell her that?”

997
01:01:54,127 --> 01:01:58,403
Eh… I pulled the rip cord
pretty much on that one, yeah.

998
01:01:58,423 --> 01:02:01,406
So I did something creepy to my daughter
in the middle of this conversation

999
01:02:01,426 --> 01:02:03,032
that my dad used to do
to me whenever I asked

1000
01:02:03,052 --> 01:02:05,410
my dad something that he didn’t
want to talk about, he would just go

1001
01:02:05,430 --> 01:02:06,703
“WHY THE HELL DO
YOU WANNA KNOW?”

1002
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:08,037
And I was so scared
of my dad I would like

1003
01:02:08,057 --> 01:02:10,540
“I don’t. I’m good.
I don’t need to know anything, I’m fine.

1004
01:02:10,560 --> 01:02:12,291
I’m prolly gonna be a
standup comedian anyway,

1005
01:02:12,311 --> 01:02:13,740
I’m just gonna go over here,

1006
01:02:13,760 --> 01:02:19,382
learn to hit on waitresses and write some
fart jokes, that’s what I’m gonna do now.”

1007
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:21,509
But I didn’t raise my daughter like
that, but I did it, I go

1008
01:02:21,529 --> 01:02:22,885
“Why do you wanna know?”

1009
01:02:22,905 --> 01:02:25,150
And she looked scared
of me and she goes “Oh,

1010
01:02:25,170 --> 01:02:28,215
I wanna understand the
black kid at my school.”

1011
01:02:33,541 --> 01:02:36,524
“THE black kid?

1012
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:38,526
You have ONE black kid at
your little private school?”

1013
01:02:38,546 --> 01:02:40,778
She goes “Yeah, her name’s Sarah,
she’s in 6th grade, she’s pretty cool,

1014
01:02:40,798 --> 01:02:43,906
I wanna understand what
her people went through.”

1015
01:02:43,926 --> 01:02:45,992
“Uh, well, I can tell you
why black people are angry…

1016
01:02:46,012 --> 01:02:49,495
because we have ONE black kid
at your little private school.

1017
01:02:49,515 --> 01:02:52,874
Yeah,
that’s probably in the top 5.”

1018
01:02:52,894 --> 01:02:55,222
And I realize I’m not
getting out of this, man.

1019
01:02:55,242 --> 01:02:57,475
And I gotta do it. And sometimes
as a parent you just gotta dive in.

1020
01:02:57,495 --> 01:02:59,630
I was like “Alright, hon.

1021
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:01,758
Alright, imagine this,
imagine living in your own country,

1022
01:03:01,778 --> 01:03:02,718
everybody’s the same.

1023
01:03:02,738 --> 01:03:04,594
And a bunch of boats show up,

1024
01:03:04,614 --> 01:03:10,099
and a bunch of people who are a,
photo negative of you, get out.”

1025
01:03:10,119 --> 01:03:14,479
I did my best.

1026
01:03:14,499 --> 01:03:17,899
“And you waive to them from the
shore, and they shoot a bunch of you.

1027
01:03:17,919 --> 01:03:20,818
And then they put you in a boat and take
you THOUSANDS of miles across the ocean.

1028
01:03:20,838 --> 01:03:23,032
And you weren’t riding
on the lead-oak deck.

1029
01:03:23,052 --> 01:03:25,740
There was no shuffleboard
on the Amistad.

1030
01:03:25,760 --> 01:03:27,784
Now you’re in another country you’ve
never been to for hundreds of years.

1031
01:03:27,804 --> 01:03:29,577
And you’re slaves for hundreds
and hundreds of years.

1032
01:03:29,597 --> 01:03:30,412
And then one day you were freed.

1033
01:03:30,432 --> 01:03:34,457
But you weren’t freed because people
had ‘insight’ to the human condition.

1034
01:03:34,477 --> 01:03:35,292
You weren’t freed
because someone said

1035
01:03:35,312 --> 01:03:38,836
‘My Land, Mary-Beth,
I woke up on the plantation this mornin’

1036
01:03:38,856 --> 01:03:42,298
and I-I just realized that one
man should not own another.

1037
01:03:42,318 --> 01:03:45,301
You-you tell Rastis and Jolene
to meet me in the kitchen,

1038
01:03:45,321 --> 01:03:49,283
I’m gonna write them a check and make
them some chocolate chip waffles!’

1039
01:03:58,292 --> 01:04:02,360
Sadly, honey, slavery did not
end with chocolate chip waffles.

1040
01:04:02,380 --> 01:04:04,862
In fact, some people
wanted their slaves SO BAD

1041
01:04:04,882 --> 01:04:08,199
they were willing to die for them, go
to war, almost split the country in two.

1042
01:04:08,219 --> 01:04:10,076
You know, and then once they were
freed, they never got paid.”

1043
01:04:10,096 --> 01:04:12,119
And my daughter just goes
“Wha— they NEVER got paid?”

1044
01:04:12,139 --> 01:04:15,405
I said, “No. They were promised
to get paid, but they never did.”

1045
01:04:15,425 --> 01:04:19,293
And my daughter, who was raised
in way too much privilege says,

1046
01:04:19,313 --> 01:04:23,317
“Well, why didn’t they hire a lawyer
and file a class action suit?”

1047
01:04:29,949 --> 01:04:35,309
Wow, one semester at Compton Junior
High would’ve taken care of all of this.

1048
01:04:35,329 --> 01:04:37,562
I said “They couldn’t file
with attorneys because

1049
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:40,022
had to follow the slave
laws.” And my daughter goes,

1050
01:04:40,042 --> 01:04:42,733
“Dad, you said they were freed.
There was no slave laws.”

1051
01:04:42,753 --> 01:04:45,319
“I know, they had these things called
‘Slave Laws’ and then when they got freed,

1052
01:04:45,339 --> 01:04:48,072
they didn’t change the
laws, they changed the name,

1053
01:04:48,092 --> 01:04:49,198
to ‘Black Laws’”

1054
01:04:49,218 --> 01:04:51,492
– it’s like now,
when you say ‘WARMONGER’

1055
01:04:51,512 --> 01:04:54,807
– you mean Republican.

1056
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:01,689
AND, when you say
‘DEMOCRAT’ you mean pussy.

1057
01:05:04,776 --> 01:05:05,757
See that?

1058
01:05:05,777 --> 01:05:10,531
See how I lost you all
and then got you all back?

1059
01:05:22,920 --> 01:05:23,901
And she says, she asks, she goes

1060
01:05:23,921 --> 01:05:26,652
“Well after those laws went away, it was
all, it was all, it was all cool, right?”

1061
01:05:26,672 --> 01:05:29,405
“Yeah, after those laws went away,
things got a lot better, you know?

1062
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:31,925
I mean, except for the hard
stuff, like, you know…

1063
01:05:31,945 --> 01:05:35,077
drinking out of the
same water fountain, or…

1064
01:05:35,097 --> 01:05:38,331
riding in the front of a
bus, or…

1065
01:05:38,351 --> 01:05:42,043
using a toilet that a
white butt had touched, or…

1066
01:05:42,063 --> 01:05:44,795
eating at a restaurant
with all white people…

1067
01:05:44,815 --> 01:05:47,009
playing sports with
white people… marrying –

1068
01:05:47,029 --> 01:05:49,842
Oh my God it’s never gonna get
better, is it?”

1069
01:05:49,862 --> 01:05:51,719
And my daughter sees me
flailing, I got nowhere to go.

1070
01:05:51,739 --> 01:05:54,648
It’s not better.
As we saw, as what’s happening right now,

1071
01:05:54,668 --> 01:05:57,558
and, and I start to flail,
and my daughter saves my ass.

1072
01:05:57,578 --> 01:05:59,396
My kid, I love my
kids, she just goes

1073
01:05:59,416 --> 01:06:01,406
“But Martin Luther
King made it better!”

1074
01:06:01,426 --> 01:06:04,649
And I go “YESSSSS!!

1075
01:06:04,669 --> 01:06:06,317
YESS! YES!

1076
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:08,277
MARTIN LUTHER KING!
HE DID MAKE IT BETTER!

1077
01:06:08,297 --> 01:06:09,445
HE WAS AN AMAZING LEADER!

1078
01:06:09,465 --> 01:06:11,113
And we marched together!
And we knew we were all the same, yes,

1079
01:06:11,133 --> 01:06:12,740
Martin Luther King was
incredible!” And she goes,

1080
01:06:12,760 --> 01:06:13,700
“What happened to
Martin Luther King?”

1081
01:06:13,720 --> 01:06:16,931
God Dammit.

1082
01:06:25,314 --> 01:06:29,757
"He was assassinated
by a white guy… uhhh…”

1083
01:06:29,777 --> 01:06:32,760
My little girl – who never
heard it like this – it’s weird.

1084
01:06:32,780 --> 01:06:35,346
We spent an hour and a half talking
and I – I pay for her school,

1085
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:37,139
she should know ALL of this

1086
01:06:37,159 --> 01:06:39,047
but I guess the
school I sent her to –

1087
01:06:39,067 --> 01:06:42,237
all the textbooks
were written in Texas.

1088
01:06:46,877 --> 01:06:49,944
I mean, cuz all I can imagine
it says is 'slavery was bad.

1089
01:06:49,964 --> 01:06:51,320
Lincoln freed the slaves.

1090
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:52,967
Good job, white guy!”

1091
01:06:59,557 --> 01:07:00,997
And she goes,
“Is that how it really went down?”

1092
01:07:01,017 --> 01:07:03,313
“Pretty much, babe.
The best I could tell ya.”

1093
01:07:03,333 --> 01:07:05,836
She goes, “Oh my God,
dad, that’s horrible.”

1094
01:07:07,064 --> 01:07:08,671
And my little girl,

1095
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:11,757
starts to cry… she’s never
heard it like this before.

1096
01:07:11,777 --> 01:07:13,676
Yeah.
And I go, “It’s ok, honey.”

1097
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:16,387
And she goes, “No,
it’s not ok, dad.

1098
01:07:16,407 --> 01:07:18,848
It’s not ok at all.
If that’s how black people…

1099
01:07:18,868 --> 01:07:22,226
were treated for 500 years…

1100
01:07:22,246 --> 01:07:24,478
that’s horrible.

1101
01:07:24,498 --> 01:07:27,231
That means that one day…

1102
01:07:27,251 --> 01:07:29,211
they’re gonna kill us!”

1103
01:07:39,722 --> 01:07:43,789
“Um, did they teach you what we did to the
Indians in your little private school, there?”

1104
01:07:43,809 --> 01:07:47,772
“NO! WHAT DID WE DO
TO THE INDIANS?!”

1105
01:07:51,650 --> 01:07:53,861
“We had Thanksgiving
dinner with them…

1106
01:07:55,988 --> 01:07:59,847
and then we cleaned up
the dishes together…

1107
01:07:59,867 --> 01:08:03,913
and then the Indians
dealt blackjack.”

1108
01:08:07,041 --> 01:08:10,441
And I pulled the ripcord
HARD, man.

1109
01:08:10,461 --> 01:08:16,739
Best Spongebob marathon I
have ever seen in my life!

1110
01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:20,493
Told you it was gonna
get uncomfortable.

1111
01:08:20,513 --> 01:08:23,575
I didn’t write this show to make
fun of your kids or my kids,

1112
01:08:23,595 --> 01:08:25,790
I wrote this show to
make fun of all of us.

1113
01:08:25,810 --> 01:08:28,375
Because everybody in this
room, right now,

1114
01:08:28,395 --> 01:08:31,754
was one of these little
douchebags I’m talking about.

1115
01:08:31,774 --> 01:08:34,006
At one point you were,
so I’m gonna give you a gift tonight,

1116
01:08:34,026 --> 01:08:36,717
that I can’t use anymore because
both my parents are gone.

1117
01:08:36,737 --> 01:08:39,095
But if your parents are still around
tomorrow morning, I want you to get up,

1118
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,055
and I want you to call them.

1119
01:08:40,075 --> 01:08:42,352
And say “Hey mom, hey
dad, how you guys doing?

1120
01:08:42,372 --> 01:08:44,617
By the way,
did you need help with anything?”

1121
01:08:44,637 --> 01:08:48,229
Now, they’re gonna
say, “What’s wrong?

1122
01:08:48,249 --> 01:08:50,126
How much money do you need?”

1123
01:08:54,964 --> 01:08:59,782
That was really giving
up too much honesty, bro.

1124
01:08:59,802 --> 01:09:03,077
And I want you to say, “No, I’m good, actually I called
because I want to ask you something, mom and dad.

1125
01:09:03,097 --> 01:09:08,374
I want you to tell me the story of the worst,
stupidest thing I ever did when I was a kid.”

1126
01:09:08,394 --> 01:09:14,839
Or, you can tell them something
they don’t know that you did.

1127
01:09:14,859 --> 01:09:16,924
That’s what I thought.

1128
01:09:16,944 --> 01:09:18,592
And then you’re gonna let them
talk, and you’re gonna listen.

1129
01:09:18,612 --> 01:09:20,177
Because we stopped listening
to our parents at one point.

1130
01:09:20,197 --> 01:09:21,428
Listen to them. You know.

1131
01:09:21,448 --> 01:09:24,807
Cuz if I could, I would LOVE to listen
my parents, and I can’t anymore.

1132
01:09:24,827 --> 01:09:27,017
And listen to them. Let them tell the
story of the stupidest thing you did.

1133
01:09:27,037 --> 01:09:27,978
It’ll surprise you.

1134
01:09:27,998 --> 01:09:31,398
Cuz you’ll think something that
wasn’t that bad is HORRIBLE to them.

1135
01:09:31,418 --> 01:09:34,735
And, and if they’re laughing while
they’re telling you that story,

1136
01:09:34,755 --> 01:09:36,152
you get to laugh with them.

1137
01:09:36,172 --> 01:09:40,406
If they’re still pissed –

1138
01:09:40,426 --> 01:09:43,617
you shut up. No excuses.

1139
01:09:43,637 --> 01:09:44,578
And you let ‘em talk.

1140
01:09:44,598 --> 01:09:46,829
And then when they’re done I
want you to apologize to them.

1141
01:09:46,849 --> 01:09:48,539
Because no matter what
you think of your parents.

1142
01:09:48,559 --> 01:09:50,332
No matter how good or
bad they raised you.

1143
01:09:50,352 --> 01:09:51,667
If they didn’t send
you to college.

1144
01:09:51,687 --> 01:09:53,377
If they were abusive.
If they were alcoholics.

1145
01:09:53,397 --> 01:09:54,129
It doesn’t matter.

1146
01:09:54,149 --> 01:09:56,338
Because at the end of the
day, your parents

1147
01:09:56,358 --> 01:09:57,882
gave you the greatest gift.

1148
01:09:57,902 --> 01:09:59,550
They gave you LIIIIFE.

1149
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,989
And you – RUINED theirs.

1150
01:10:03,991 --> 01:10:06,118
RUINED it.

1151
01:10:08,245 --> 01:10:10,899
I know you don’t believe
that, but it’s fuckin’ true.

1152
01:10:13,459 --> 01:10:15,449
They had dreams,
and then you were born,

1153
01:10:15,469 --> 01:10:17,610
and that’s all they had.

1154
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:19,653
Dreams.

1155
01:10:19,673 --> 01:10:22,134
Well, thank you little bastard…

1156
01:10:25,221 --> 01:10:27,640
“WAAAA!”

1157
01:10:28,557 --> 01:10:30,706
I didn’t get it.
I didn’t get it until becoming a parent.

1158
01:10:30,726 --> 01:10:32,917
You know why?
If you’ve seen my comedy, in the past,

1159
01:10:32,937 --> 01:10:34,877
I have not been very
nice to my father.

1160
01:10:34,897 --> 01:10:36,275
I have said some horrible –

1161
01:10:36,295 --> 01:10:38,923
I have basically said
my father was abusive.

1162
01:10:38,943 --> 01:10:40,549
But I have now had kids…

1163
01:10:40,569 --> 01:10:43,121
and they’re both over 10
years old… and I realized…

1164
01:10:43,141 --> 01:10:44,720
my father wasn’t abusive…

1165
01:10:44,740 --> 01:10:47,701
he was trying not to murder me.

1166
01:10:50,329 --> 01:10:52,895
If you’re abusive,
you’re kicking someone down the stairs,

1167
01:10:52,915 --> 01:10:54,438
you’re punchin’ ‘em,
you’re burning them with a cigarette.

1168
01:10:54,458 --> 01:10:56,273
My dad didn’t do that.
Even when I did something stupid,

1169
01:10:56,293 --> 01:10:58,385
he would just come
over to me and just go,

1170
01:10:58,405 --> 01:11:00,027
“AHHHH!! MOTHER-OH MY GOD

1171
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:02,529
- YOU MOTHERFUCKER-AHHHHHHH,

1172
01:11:02,549 --> 01:11:05,491
GOD, AHHHHHHHH,

1173
01:11:05,511 --> 01:11:07,429
MOTHER…!!”

1174
01:11:21,065 --> 01:11:23,342
I used to think my dad
was angry cuz he drank.

1175
01:11:23,362 --> 01:11:27,221
NO. He drank cuz he was angry.

1176
01:11:27,241 --> 01:11:29,014
He swore to the day he died,

1177
01:11:29,034 --> 01:11:31,809
that when I was 22 years
old I tried to kill him.

1178
01:11:31,829 --> 01:11:33,936
Used to tell everybody,
used to tell everybody.

1179
01:11:33,956 --> 01:11:35,437
I was successful,
I had a TV Show,

1180
01:11:35,457 --> 01:11:37,773
“Mr. Titus, your son’s really doing
well, he’s got his own television show,

1181
01:11:37,793 --> 01:11:39,817
he’s done a bunch of comedy
specials, you gotta be really proud.”

1182
01:11:39,837 --> 01:11:44,822
“Yeah, would be proud, but dumb-ass
tried to kill me when he was 22.”

1183
01:11:44,842 --> 01:11:49,034
“Thanks dad, that’s the network
president, that’s not helpful.”

1184
01:11:49,054 --> 01:11:50,160
What happened was, well,

1185
01:11:50,180 --> 01:11:52,162
when I was 17 and a half,
my dad and I used to get in fistfights.

1186
01:11:52,182 --> 01:11:53,580
We would brawl, it was bad.

1187
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:56,417
And I got my ass handed to
me pretty much all the time.

1188
01:11:56,437 --> 01:11:58,002
So, at 17 and a half,
I had moved out, I said,

1189
01:11:58,022 --> 01:12:00,504
“I’m moving to San Francisco,
I’m going to become a stand-up comedian,

1190
01:12:00,524 --> 01:12:01,964
and I’m going to be
the best comedian ever,

1191
01:12:01,984 --> 01:12:04,133
and I’m gonna stuff it up your
ass, old man!”

1192
01:12:04,153 --> 01:12:06,427
And I moved to San Francisco,
and I worked for 18 months,

1193
01:12:06,447 --> 01:12:08,928
4 shows a night, wrote ‘til 4 a.m.
in the morning.

1194
01:12:08,948 --> 01:12:10,581
Yeah, and after 18 months.
HA HA!

1195
01:12:10,601 --> 01:12:14,893
I had to move back
to my dad’s house…

1196
01:12:14,913 --> 01:12:18,272
cuz it hadn’t gone
how I had thought.

1197
01:12:18,292 --> 01:12:22,443
And I went to my plan B, which was
working at Kentucky Fried Chicken.

1198
01:12:22,463 --> 01:12:25,841
And if the humidity’s right,
you can still smell it on me.

1199
01:12:31,305 --> 01:12:33,954
And I was a closer. And I’d drive
home every night in my little P.O.S.

1200
01:12:33,974 --> 01:12:36,558
and I’d drive it home and,
and after about 2 months,

1201
01:12:36,578 --> 01:12:39,742
this guy had parked his ’56 Chevy
on his lawn on my route home,

1202
01:12:39,762 --> 01:12:41,712
and it said ‘For Sale $1,800’

1203
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:46,069
I stopped the car every night, and I would
just stand across the street, staring at it

1204
01:12:48,572 --> 01:12:50,137
And I fell in love with
the car – I had to have it.

1205
01:12:50,157 --> 01:12:51,097
It was a mistake.

1206
01:12:51,117 --> 01:12:53,849
It was that first guy, love,
car thing and I just – I had to have it.

1207
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:55,934
So I saved up for 3 months,
and I get enough money, and I said,

1208
01:12:55,954 --> 01:12:56,894
“Dad,
I’m gonna go buy this car.”

1209
01:12:56,914 --> 01:12:57,604
And he said “The Hell you are.”

1210
01:12:57,624 --> 01:13:00,564
And I said “I’m over 18 now,
you can suck it, old man.”

1211
01:13:00,584 --> 01:13:05,194
With respect, because he controlled
the food and the shelter, though.

1212
01:13:05,214 --> 01:13:07,154
And my dad said something he
never said to me before, he said,

1213
01:13:07,174 --> 01:13:08,114
“Let me go with you,

1214
01:13:08,134 --> 01:13:10,240
I’ve made more mistakes
in my life than you have,

1215
01:13:10,260 --> 01:13:12,368
let me help you buy the car
so you don’t get ripped off.”

1216
01:13:12,388 --> 01:13:13,328
And I was 18,

1217
01:13:13,348 --> 01:13:15,891
and my first thought
was “WOOOAAHHHH.

1218
01:13:16,975 --> 01:13:20,542
I’m so suspicious.”

1219
01:13:20,562 --> 01:13:22,378
But I had to admit it – my
dad was a great salesman.

1220
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,796
He was a GREAT salesman.
He got married 6 times,

1221
01:13:24,816 --> 01:13:26,799
he was a GREAAAT salesman.

1222
01:13:26,819 --> 01:13:28,717
GREAT salesman.

1223
01:13:28,737 --> 01:13:31,178
I still don’t know how
he got number 6 to go

1224
01:13:31,198 --> 01:13:33,367
“I’m a unicorn!”

1225
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,435
So we go to this guys’ house,

1226
01:13:38,455 --> 01:13:40,145
we go to this guys’ house
and, you know the car,

1227
01:13:40,165 --> 01:13:42,289
and I’m just all amped
up cuz I got my dad,

1228
01:13:42,309 --> 01:13:46,136
and I’m feelin’ cocky, and I go,
“How you doing? We came to look at the car.

1229
01:13:46,156 --> 01:13:48,904
Brought my dad.

1230
01:13:48,924 --> 01:13:51,698
He knows karate.”

1231
01:13:51,718 --> 01:13:54,201
And my dad just goes,
“Shut up, idiot!

1232
01:13:54,221 --> 01:13:57,057
I’m not letting you sell
my son this piece of crap.

1233
01:13:59,393 --> 01:14:03,127
Dad, are we gonna beat him and take it?
What are we doing?”

1234
01:14:03,147 --> 01:14:05,754
“Shut up! And he starts
walking around the car.

1235
01:14:05,774 --> 01:14:06,714
He just starts tearing it apart.

1236
01:14:06,734 --> 01:14:08,673
“Bumpers are twisted,
rims don’t match,

1237
01:14:08,693 --> 01:14:13,262
oh my god, the upholstery by
a blind Mexican in Tiajuana?”

1238
01:14:13,282 --> 01:14:14,055
“Dad, is this a technique?

1239
01:14:14,075 --> 01:14:17,953
Why are we making fun of handicapped
Hispanic people now, what are we doing?”

1240
01:14:17,973 --> 01:14:19,476
“I told you to shut up!...

1241
01:14:19,496 --> 01:14:22,062
I’ll give you a thousand bucks for the
car, that’s it, take it or leave it.”

1242
01:14:22,082 --> 01:14:23,798
And I’m just waiting
for this guy –

1243
01:14:23,818 --> 01:14:25,383
he’s being so aggressive –
just, I want this guy to,

1244
01:14:25,403 --> 01:14:28,402
please punch my dad in throat.
Go ahead.

1245
01:14:28,422 --> 01:14:29,987
And instead,
the guy just goes “Hold on.”

1246
01:14:30,007 --> 01:14:31,321
And he walks in his house.

1247
01:14:31,341 --> 01:14:32,781
What we heard next,

1248
01:14:32,801 --> 01:14:35,282
for the next two minutes
was like a radio cartoon.

1249
01:14:35,302 --> 01:14:37,190
And the guy walks
in and we just hear,

1250
01:14:37,210 --> 01:14:40,507
“Hey,
herraahherrraadaaahowwwyaa.”

1251
01:14:51,528 --> 01:14:54,845
Then a pan bangs on
the front window.

1252
01:14:54,865 --> 01:14:59,141
And I’m 18,
so the look on my face…

1253
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:03,582
my dad, “This is how it goes…”

1254
01:15:05,626 --> 01:15:09,004
And he downloaded
another program.

1255
01:15:15,719 --> 01:15:17,097
And the guy walks back out,

1256
01:15:17,117 --> 01:15:22,289
and when the guy hit the door, it looked like
someone had injected him with three decades.

1257
01:15:28,065 --> 01:15:31,131
“Ok, I’ll take a thousand.”

1258
01:15:31,151 --> 01:15:33,634
And I thought, “I LOVE MY DAD!”

1259
01:15:33,654 --> 01:15:37,721
And I remember it clearly because
it was the first time I thought it.

1260
01:15:37,741 --> 01:15:39,723
And we were driving home,
and he was right, the car was horrible.

1261
01:15:39,743 --> 01:15:43,519
But I’m like, I can’t believe you got
me this car! I can’t believe it, dad!

1262
01:15:43,539 --> 01:15:47,585
You saved me 800 bucks!
“I saved you 600 bucks.”

1263
01:15:49,419 --> 01:15:51,527
“No, dad,
1,800 minus a thousand is 800.”

1264
01:15:51,547 --> 01:15:55,384
“I’m keeping 200 bucks
for negotiating the deal.”

1265
01:15:57,553 --> 01:16:01,265
And he downloaded
yet another program.

1266
01:16:06,436 --> 01:16:08,752
And he was right about this
car, he was so right about it.

1267
01:16:08,772 --> 01:16:12,784
It was horrible. The car, the steering
wheel was vaguely connected to something.

1268
01:16:12,804 --> 01:16:15,560
You’d spin it and it was like
the car had broken a hip,

1269
01:16:15,580 --> 01:16:17,344
it would just go – ehhhhhhh-

1270
01:16:17,364 --> 01:16:21,723
but if you hit the brakes,
it made a HARD left,

1271
01:16:21,743 --> 01:16:24,017
because…

1272
01:16:24,037 --> 01:16:28,564
because the left front brake
was the only one that operated.

1273
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:30,482
Remember that first car you had, guys?
That horrible one, man?

1274
01:16:30,502 --> 01:16:33,527
But you bought a fire extinguisher, mounted
inside cuz it looked so high-performance,

1275
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:36,863
but also because you really
needed a fire extinguisher.

1276
01:16:36,883 --> 01:16:38,532
Cuz you’d done some
wiring by yourself,

1277
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:40,701
and now when you hit the blinker,
the windshield wipers stared up and,

1278
01:16:40,721 --> 01:16:44,395
you left it like that so you didn’t
screw something else up. You’re like,

1279
01:16:44,415 --> 01:16:49,543
“No, it works, watch. I’m going that way,
I’m going that way, I’m going that way.”

1280
01:16:49,563 --> 01:16:50,711
Yeah.

1281
01:16:50,731 --> 01:16:53,505
Spent all that money on that
stereo, that really nice stereo,

1282
01:16:53,525 --> 01:16:54,590
but you couldn’t figure
out how to mount it,

1283
01:16:54,610 --> 01:16:57,593
so it just sat on the
passenger seat for 3 months.

1284
01:16:57,613 --> 01:16:59,720
Wires snaking out of the dash.

1285
01:16:59,740 --> 01:17:02,514
You ran out of electrical tape, so you
used clear tape – which was a bonus,

1286
01:17:02,534 --> 01:17:04,099
cuz now on Friday night when you’re
hanging out with your buddies,

1287
01:17:04,119 --> 01:17:06,997
you could roll joints to the
sparks coming off the dash.

1288
01:17:11,918 --> 01:17:15,027
My dad had a client that gave
me this big spool of red wire…

1289
01:17:15,047 --> 01:17:19,656
I rewired the ENTIRE car
with one color of wire.

1290
01:17:19,676 --> 01:17:24,119
SHUT UP GUYS WHO KNOW
WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT.

1291
01:17:24,139 --> 01:17:27,289
I knew it. It was perfect.

1292
01:17:27,309 --> 01:17:31,168
Power, ground, power, ground.

1293
01:17:31,188 --> 01:17:32,878
PERFECT.

1294
01:17:32,898 --> 01:17:36,381
Then, when I turned the key
on, it went

1295
01:17:36,401 --> 01:17:40,302
And… thank God I had
a fire extinguisher.

1296
01:17:40,322 --> 01:17:42,512
So I spend 4 years
working on this car.

1297
01:17:42,532 --> 01:17:43,930
And I’ve changed –
I fixed everything.

1298
01:17:43,950 --> 01:17:46,725
Because I broke everything in the
car, I ruined it.

1299
01:17:46,745 --> 01:17:48,602
From the rear-end to the
train, everything.

1300
01:17:48,622 --> 01:17:51,521
I had to fix everything. The suspension.
I broke everything in this car.

1301
01:17:51,541 --> 01:17:54,066
But after 22 it was
badass… lowered down…

1302
01:17:54,086 --> 01:17:56,535
motor, brand new motor,
new tranny, it was great.

1303
01:17:56,555 --> 01:17:59,821
Burned tire, it was like 360,
460 horsepower, it was badass.

1304
01:17:59,841 --> 01:18:01,198
But the dumbest
car for a comedian

1305
01:18:01,218 --> 01:18:03,742
because I gotta drive to these
one-nighters all over California,

1306
01:18:03,762 --> 01:18:05,344
and every dime is going to gas.

1307
01:18:05,364 --> 01:18:09,618
Cuz the carburetor was a toilet
bowl, basically.

1308
01:18:12,270 --> 01:18:13,877
And I was in Northern
California where we lived

1309
01:18:13,897 --> 01:18:16,806
and I had to get down here to
LA to do a gig, one-nighter.

1310
01:18:16,826 --> 01:18:18,632
And I had just
enough money for gas.

1311
01:18:18,652 --> 01:18:21,176
And the car, the ballast
resistor in the car had gone bad.

1312
01:18:21,196 --> 01:18:22,136
The ballast resistor basically,

1313
01:18:22,156 --> 01:18:24,179
it’s the thing that takes the
battery voltage and lowers it,

1314
01:18:24,199 --> 01:18:27,724
so it goes into the distributor
and doesn’t burn... the point –

1315
01:18:27,744 --> 01:18:32,124
CAR NO WORK GOOD NO MORE.

1316
01:18:36,503 --> 01:18:37,526
And I couldn’t afford the part.

1317
01:18:37,546 --> 01:18:39,861
I wouldn’t have made the gas
money, and my dad’s boat,

1318
01:18:39,881 --> 01:18:42,197
it was January, my dad’s boat was
parked on the side of his house,

1319
01:18:42,217 --> 01:18:43,748
as I learned earlier in life –

1320
01:18:43,768 --> 01:18:48,620
it aint stealin’ if
they ‘aint usin’ it!”

1321
01:18:48,640 --> 01:18:51,415
Be careful what you download.

1322
01:18:51,435 --> 01:18:55,313
So, I took the ballast resistor to put
on the car, VROOM, made it to LA, woo!

1323
01:18:55,333 --> 01:18:58,502
And I don’t think about it
again, for 6 months.

1324
01:19:01,528 --> 01:19:05,345
And then it was brought
to my attention.

1325
01:19:05,365 --> 01:19:08,223
It’s now June… my dad, uh,
had gotten rid of stepmom number 5,

1326
01:19:08,243 --> 01:19:10,475
was looking for number
6, uh, playing the field,

1327
01:19:10,495 --> 01:19:11,476
and he was gonna take
her out in this boat.

1328
01:19:11,496 --> 01:19:13,979
And he backed his boat out and he
washed it up and it wouldn’t start.

1329
01:19:13,999 --> 01:19:16,064
So he took the gas out,
put fresh gas in and it wouldn’t start.

1330
01:19:16,084 --> 01:19:18,483
Now, it’s a hot, California day.

1331
01:19:18,503 --> 01:19:20,952
He’s got a twelve pack of
beer that he’s drinkin’

1332
01:19:20,972 --> 01:19:24,948
– or, snack pack of beer
that he’s drinkin’.

1333
01:19:24,968 --> 01:19:27,033
And he’s just working in the hot sun
and he’s getting angrier and angrier,

1334
01:19:27,053 --> 01:19:28,660
and he takes the spark plugs
out, won’t fix it,

1335
01:19:28,680 --> 01:19:30,537
he takes the distributor out,
checks all the wiring out,

1336
01:19:30,557 --> 01:19:32,372
get on the top, can’t fix
it, changes the coil,

1337
01:19:32,392 --> 01:19:34,040
he’s going back and
forth to the part store,

1338
01:19:34,060 --> 01:19:35,167
this goes on for four
and a half hours,

1339
01:19:35,187 --> 01:19:37,711
and finally he gets pissed and he
starts tracing the wiring harness

1340
01:19:37,731 --> 01:19:40,589
and he finds two wires
just hanging out in space.

1341
01:19:40,609 --> 01:19:41,549
And I know what he did,

1342
01:19:41,569 --> 01:19:43,008
he started spazz-mumbling
like I do.

1343
01:19:43,028 --> 01:19:45,177
“You son of a bitch.
He’s a grown man now,

1344
01:19:45,197 --> 01:19:46,845
I can’t believe he just went…

1345
01:19:46,865 --> 01:19:48,632
I’m gonna find a
drill and cordless,

1346
01:19:48,652 --> 01:19:50,342
I’m gonna put it through his skull.
And you know what?

1347
01:19:50,362 --> 01:19:53,351
It’s not child abuse now,
now it’s manslaughter, haha!

1348
01:19:53,371 --> 01:19:56,605
Yeah! I’ll run cell block D,

1349
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:59,836
you kill your own kid,
you can run the prison, sir!”

1350
01:20:03,048 --> 01:20:06,782
And he got angrier and angrier
and angrier and angrier,

1351
01:20:06,802 --> 01:20:11,119
and my dad, uh,
didn’t do a whole lot of cardio.

1352
01:20:11,139 --> 01:20:14,684
And his heart went
Union and took a break.

1353
01:20:17,521 --> 01:20:18,752
He had a heart attack.

1354
01:20:18,772 --> 01:20:21,151
They called me and said,
“He had a heart attack”

1355
01:20:21,171 --> 01:20:22,111
I said “Oh my God,
he had a heart attack,”

1356
01:20:22,131 --> 01:20:25,926
“It’s a mild heart attack,” That’s
what they told me. I’m like,

1357
01:20:25,946 --> 01:20:30,263
“UH, shall I bring yogurt, then?
What’s a mild heart attack?”

1358
01:20:30,283 --> 01:20:31,848
And I was 200 miles
away in Fresno,

1359
01:20:31,868 --> 01:20:34,100
and just like tonight,
I was just doin' a show,

1360
01:20:34,120 --> 01:20:37,479
I get off stage, the club manager’s
got the phone out like this and he goes

1361
01:20:37,499 --> 01:20:39,439
“Take the phone,” I go
“What...” “TAKE THE PHONE.”

1362
01:20:39,459 --> 01:20:42,275
And I take it, it’s my fifth stepmother,
and this is how the conversation goes,

1363
01:20:42,295 --> 01:20:43,527
I go, “Hello?” She says,

1364
01:20:43,547 --> 01:20:48,365
“You killed your father!”

1365
01:20:48,385 --> 01:20:52,536
“I have been here
the whole night!

1366
01:20:52,556 --> 01:20:56,665
No...

1367
01:20:56,685 --> 01:21:02,671
I understand why I’m a
suspect, but I have witnesses.”

1368
01:21:02,691 --> 01:21:06,424
Then she says,
“Did you take something off his boat?”

1369
01:21:06,444 --> 01:21:11,221
“OOOOOOOHHHH.”

1370
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:14,641
And I check how far Mexico is…

1371
01:21:14,661 --> 01:21:17,185
and I don’t have the gas money.
So…

1372
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:18,728
I get up the next morning,
I drive to the hospital,

1373
01:21:18,748 --> 01:21:22,941
I walk into ICU, my dad is,
is hooked to machines, he’s grey.

1374
01:21:22,961 --> 01:21:24,067
It’s weird, man, he’s grey.

1375
01:21:24,087 --> 01:21:27,362
With fathers and sons, there’s a
weird thing like mothers and daughters

1376
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:28,947
and I walked in and I’m
just looking at him,

1377
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:31,157
and he’s grey and he’s hooked to
machines, and he looks weak and…

1378
01:21:31,177 --> 01:21:34,848
you gotta remember,
he’s my Hitler, you know?

1379
01:21:41,271 --> 01:21:44,337
And I go, “Dad, this is horrible,
oh my God, I can’t believe this.

1380
01:21:44,357 --> 01:21:46,715
What did this feel
like?” And he says this,

1381
01:21:46,735 --> 01:21:49,491
“Felt like somebody parked
a garbage truck on my chest,

1382
01:21:49,511 --> 01:21:52,804
I couldn’t feel anything.
I couldn’t move, it was horrible.”

1383
01:21:52,824 --> 01:21:56,345
I said, “Dad, you’ve been smoking
and drinking for 40 years, you know?

1384
01:21:56,365 --> 01:21:59,978
I mean, you start the
morning with pork rinds.

1385
01:21:59,998 --> 01:22:00,938
I think maybe it’s time…”

1386
01:22:00,958 --> 01:22:02,898
And before I out the next
word, he goes

1387
01:22:02,918 --> 01:22:06,651
“How’s your fuckin’
car running?”

1388
01:22:06,671 --> 01:22:12,032
THAT’S HOW ANGRY
CHILDREN WILL MAKE YOU.

1389
01:22:12,052 --> 01:22:15,785
HE WAS HOOKED TO MACHINES!!

1390
01:22:15,805 --> 01:22:19,122
HE WAS ABOUT TO GO INTO
THE LIGHT TO MEET JEEEESUS

1391
01:22:19,142 --> 01:22:24,210
and he went – HOLD ON, JESUS.
LET ME DEAL WITH DIPSHIT FIRST.

1392
01:22:24,230 --> 01:22:28,693
That’s how angry.
That’s how angry.

1393
01:22:32,072 --> 01:22:34,062
I don’t want this
show to scare anybody.

1394
01:22:34,082 --> 01:22:35,597
This show, uh,

1395
01:22:35,617 --> 01:22:37,862
I’ve had pregnant women
leave this show like,

1396
01:22:37,882 --> 01:22:41,427
“Thanks dickhead, that’s great.
Thank you.”

1397
01:22:44,303 --> 01:22:45,815
Don’t let this show scare you,

1398
01:22:45,835 --> 01:22:47,525
because if you do
your job as a parent,

1399
01:22:47,545 --> 01:22:49,069
keep downloading programs,

1400
01:22:49,089 --> 01:22:50,820
don’t raise douchebags,
you’ll be fine.

1401
01:22:50,840 --> 01:22:51,781
It takes a while.

1402
01:22:51,801 --> 01:22:53,990
I didn’t realize I was doing
ok until my daughter turned 13,

1403
01:22:54,010 --> 01:22:56,459
she graduated 8th grade,
and they had a ceremony,

1404
01:22:56,479 --> 01:22:58,495
because they all
get ceremonies now…

1405
01:22:58,515 --> 01:22:59,913
for everything. Oh my God,

1406
01:22:59,933 --> 01:23:02,707
she had a preschool ceremony,
a kindergarten ceremony,

1407
01:23:02,727 --> 01:23:04,918
a sixth grade ceremony, eighth grade…
because they’re all so special.

1408
01:23:04,938 --> 01:23:07,128
“Thomas, you’re going to be the
best roofer ever, yes you are!

1409
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:08,838
You need a ceremony.”

1410
01:23:08,858 --> 01:23:12,801
That’s right, “Ethan, you’re going to put those
cones on the freeway like nobody’s business, Ethan,

1411
01:23:12,821 --> 01:23:14,427
yes you are!

1412
01:23:14,447 --> 01:23:17,263
Margie, you are going
to be the BEST strip-

1413
01:23:17,283 --> 01:23:20,892
Exotic dancer, ever there was!”

1414
01:23:20,912 --> 01:23:24,396
Yeah, yeah,
they’re all really special, ok.

1415
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:27,691
She’s going to have, they have eighth grade
graduation ceremony, uh, so we’re gonna go.

1416
01:23:27,711 --> 01:23:29,344
Now,
I have to set this story up.

1417
01:23:29,364 --> 01:23:34,531
Everyone in this room has a psychotic
relative that lives too close to them.

1418
01:23:34,551 --> 01:23:37,158
The problem is you have to invite
them to Thanksgiving and Christmas,

1419
01:23:37,178 --> 01:23:40,648
because if you don’t, they may drive
by, notice they weren’t invited,

1420
01:23:40,668 --> 01:23:44,666
and then there’s
gonna be a drive-by.

1421
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:46,876
In my family it’s my
Aunt, she’s 63,

1422
01:23:46,896 --> 01:23:50,111
she’s my mother’s sister,
my mom was crazy, used to hear voices,

1423
01:23:50,131 --> 01:23:53,426
and my aunt also hears voices,
but she calls them ‘her guides.’

1424
01:23:57,282 --> 01:24:00,724
And her guides
PREDICT THE FUTURE!

1425
01:24:00,744 --> 01:24:04,644
THAT HAS NEVER HAPPENED, EVER!

1426
01:24:04,664 --> 01:24:07,147
5 years ago, she said down at the
dinner table with us and said this,

1427
01:24:07,167 --> 01:24:08,902
we’re just eating
dinner, she goes,

1428
01:24:08,922 --> 01:24:13,737
“My guides told me I’m
gonna die in August.”

1429
01:24:13,757 --> 01:24:17,302
“Well, tick tock.”

1430
01:24:21,014 --> 01:24:22,424
She also doesn’t have a job,

1431
01:24:22,444 --> 01:24:24,128
“Cuz I aint payin’
Obama’s taxes!”

1432
01:24:24,148 --> 01:24:27,250
But she’s willing
to live off of ours.

1433
01:24:27,270 --> 01:24:29,419
I will say this, you know,
she’s also got some great skills.

1434
01:24:29,439 --> 01:24:31,629
I told her, I said, you’re a great
cook, go work at a bakery,

1435
01:24:31,649 --> 01:24:33,798
under the table for cash,
it’ll be phenomenal.

1436
01:24:33,818 --> 01:24:35,550
She goes, “I can’t,
if I stand too long, my back hurts.”

1437
01:24:35,570 --> 01:24:36,885
I said,
“I got a buddy who works at Hulu,

1438
01:24:36,905 --> 01:24:38,511
you could actually do like,
tech support in the morning.”

1439
01:24:38,531 --> 01:24:41,701
“Ah, if I sit too
long, my back hurts.”

1440
01:24:44,287 --> 01:24:47,937
“Well, that leaves, hooker.

1441
01:24:47,957 --> 01:24:52,295
And… at 63, you’re not really
a first-round draft pick.”

1442
01:24:56,049 --> 01:24:58,294
Now, don’t get me wrong,
I love her to death.

1443
01:24:58,314 --> 01:25:02,277
She’s my aunt, been asking to be in my
show for a long time...there you go.

1444
01:25:04,349 --> 01:25:05,789
Now, something else has
happened in my life.

1445
01:25:05,809 --> 01:25:08,463
I – uh, I got married again.
Uh, for the second time.

1446
01:25:08,483 --> 01:25:11,953
Because love is possible – you just
gotta get rid of your first wife.

1447
01:25:14,567 --> 01:25:19,969
Or, first husband,
depending on the sexual organ, either way.

1448
01:25:19,989 --> 01:25:22,263
So, I married… she’s amazing.

1449
01:25:22,283 --> 01:25:24,641
And my kids… I have ‘em 50/50…

1450
01:25:24,661 --> 01:25:27,468
so my ex has them half the
time, and then half the time,

1451
01:25:27,488 --> 01:25:30,605
me and my new wife,
WERE LIVIN’ THE LAMBORGHINI LIFE!

1452
01:25:30,625 --> 01:25:32,982
We were going to
concerts, and partying…

1453
01:25:33,002 --> 01:25:35,196
and going,
and have resorts… it was AMAZING.

1454
01:25:35,216 --> 01:25:38,011
And then her MOM got sick,
and moved in with us.

1455
01:25:43,388 --> 01:25:45,723
And – and that’s good too.

1456
01:25:51,187 --> 01:25:52,669
Her mom was also 63,

1457
01:25:52,689 --> 01:25:53,920
but her mom and my aunt
are different people.

1458
01:25:53,940 --> 01:25:56,166
Her mother’s got a
Masters degree in fine art

1459
01:25:56,186 --> 01:25:59,086
she’s an amazing artist. She was running
a department at an American University,

1460
01:25:59,106 --> 01:26:02,011
and she’s, she’s hardcore.
She’s pretty hardcore.

1461
01:26:02,031 --> 01:26:02,972
Her and I argue sometimes.

1462
01:26:02,992 --> 01:26:04,880
And, she’s always,
she’s always right.

1463
01:26:04,900 --> 01:26:09,519
I don’t mean, she thinks she’s always right,
I mean, I go look it up and fuck, she’s right.

1464
01:26:09,539 --> 01:26:13,857
It’s annoying.
It’s really annoying.

1465
01:26:13,877 --> 01:26:16,693
And her and my aunt…
don’t really… get along.

1466
01:26:16,713 --> 01:26:19,418
They don’t play Gin together.
It’s like… it’s imagine…

1467
01:26:19,438 --> 01:26:22,991
how I imagine Charlie Sheen and
Ghandi would get along. Like…

1468
01:26:23,011 --> 01:26:26,931
“WINNING!!” “NO,
YOU ARE NOT WINNING TODAY!”

1469
01:26:32,061 --> 01:26:34,794
So, her mom is sick,
and I call my aunt, and I go,

1470
01:26:34,814 --> 01:26:37,463
“Hey,” now we’re back to this story,
“Hey, would you do us a favor?”

1471
01:26:37,483 --> 01:26:39,301
Uh, my kids go to
a Christian School,

1472
01:26:39,321 --> 01:26:42,387
“Would you reserve us seats in the chapel
for the 8th grade graduation ceremony?"

1473
01:26:42,407 --> 01:26:44,721
My aunt says she
would, and uh, we go.

1474
01:26:44,741 --> 01:26:48,183
So, we show up at the ceremony.

1475
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:50,894
My aunt has saved us seats

1476
01:26:50,914 --> 01:26:52,812
for my daughters’ graduation.

1477
01:26:52,832 --> 01:26:54,522
DIRECTLY

1478
01:26:54,542 --> 01:26:59,402
behind my ex-wife.

1479
01:26:59,422 --> 01:27:02,113
We don’t get along very well.

1480
01:27:02,133 --> 01:27:04,407
We hate each-others guts.

1481
01:27:04,427 --> 01:27:07,132
And she hates my new wife,
and my new wife LOVES that.

1482
01:27:17,357 --> 01:27:20,368
And then my wife’s mother and
my aunt have this weird thing.

1483
01:27:20,388 --> 01:27:23,246
If the church knew how much
EVIL was in that little area…

1484
01:27:23,343 --> 01:27:25,231
like, the Jesus on
the cross was like,

1485
01:27:25,251 --> 01:27:27,639
“Does anyone see what’s
going on over there?

1486
01:27:27,659 --> 01:27:31,017
Right there.

1487
01:27:31,037 --> 01:27:32,977
Oh my…

1488
01:27:32,997 --> 01:27:37,919
Why has thou forsaken
me, again?”

1489
01:27:38,670 --> 01:27:40,777
So we just sit down, and I’m just
grumbling, and they start the ceremony.

1490
01:27:40,797 --> 01:27:44,530
Here’s how the ceremony starts
for the 8th grade graduation.

1491
01:27:44,550 --> 01:27:46,366
Pastor gets up and goes,
“You know, tonight,

1492
01:27:46,386 --> 01:27:48,243
I want to talk about mothers.
Cuz mothers,

1493
01:27:48,263 --> 01:27:50,234
are the most amazing
thing in the world.

1494
01:27:50,254 --> 01:27:51,887
They give birth, they give life,

1495
01:27:51,907 --> 01:27:55,750
then through love and nurturing,
raise the amazing young adults behind me.

1496
01:27:55,770 --> 01:27:58,544
Without mothers, we have no Earth,
without mother, we have no species.

1497
01:27:58,564 --> 01:28:00,171
Now, in my head, I’m thinking,

1498
01:28:00,191 --> 01:28:03,383
“So, I guess fathers, what?
Fill the car with gas and wash it?

1499
01:28:03,403 --> 01:28:06,928
Is that our gig?”

1500
01:28:06,948 --> 01:28:10,390
But,
you can’t heckle in a church.

1501
01:28:10,410 --> 01:28:12,787
Only gotta tell me once...

1502
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:21,015
So it continues like
that for a while,

1503
01:28:21,035 --> 01:28:24,148
“Mothers, mothers, mothers,
mothers, blah blah blah, mothers.”

1504
01:28:25,008 --> 01:28:26,641
And then they say,
“We would now,

1505
01:28:26,661 --> 01:28:28,825
like all the mothers
to please stand.”

1506
01:28:28,845 --> 01:28:32,453
Well, my new wife has raised my
daughter half the time for nine years.

1507
01:28:32,473 --> 01:28:35,226
So, she stood up.

1508
01:28:40,773 --> 01:28:43,089
And my ex-wife stood up
right in front of her

1509
01:28:43,109 --> 01:28:46,175
and I went – HMMMMMMM

1510
01:28:46,195 --> 01:28:49,304
and I can feel the
tumor starting.

1511
01:28:49,324 --> 01:28:50,555
And my aunt goes, “Oh my God,

1512
01:28:50,575 --> 01:28:53,433
it’s the mom and the evil stepmother.
It’s the mom and the evil stepmother.

1513
01:28:53,453 --> 01:28:55,393
It’s the mom and
the evil stepmother.

1514
01:28:55,413 --> 01:28:57,937
And her mother,
who’s on chemo goes,

1515
01:28:57,957 --> 01:29:01,753
“SAY IT ONE MORE TIME.”

1516
01:29:03,921 --> 01:29:06,883
I look up, Jesus is weeping.

1517
01:29:10,845 --> 01:29:13,119
They then said, “We now,

1518
01:29:13,139 --> 01:29:16,609
are gonna give each child a yellow
rose to walk out to their mother.”

1519
01:29:19,145 --> 01:29:22,648
Jesus got out a pry-bar.

1520
01:29:23,399 --> 01:29:26,444
“I’m not doin’ this, nope.”

1521
01:29:36,204 --> 01:29:38,728
And they start handing
roses to children,

1522
01:29:38,748 --> 01:29:40,855
and they’re going down the center
aisle, and he’s the scene.

1523
01:29:40,875 --> 01:29:43,375
Church music,
church lighting and mothers weeping.

1524
01:29:43,395 --> 01:29:45,735
It was beauuuutiful.

1525
01:29:45,755 --> 01:29:49,781
And then I realized, Oh,
that’s why they didn’t bring up fathers.

1526
01:29:49,801 --> 01:29:51,230
“Dad, here’s a yellow rose.”

1527
01:29:51,250 --> 01:29:54,243
“Shut up and sit down.

1528
01:29:54,263 --> 01:29:57,872
Tomorrow we’re getting
you some yoga pants…

1529
01:29:57,892 --> 01:30:01,250
fruit cup.”

1530
01:30:01,270 --> 01:30:03,086
So the kids are
walking the roses out…

1531
01:30:03,106 --> 01:30:05,380
And it just… it’s just mothers
weeping and it’s beautiful.

1532
01:30:05,400 --> 01:30:07,090
My daughter gets up to her turn.

1533
01:30:07,110 --> 01:30:09,384
And the pastor
holds up the rose,

1534
01:30:09,404 --> 01:30:11,761
and my daughter doesn’t take it.

1535
01:30:11,781 --> 01:30:14,230
And I thought, “Well,
let’s see where this goes…”

1536
01:30:16,411 --> 01:30:19,519
Now, while my ex and my new
wife are standing there,

1537
01:30:19,539 --> 01:30:22,563
I have a moment to
compare and contrast.

1538
01:30:22,583 --> 01:30:26,401
My new wife,
is 13 years younger than my ex-wife.

1539
01:30:26,421 --> 01:30:29,715
I think,
I think that’s a win in my column.

1540
01:30:32,301 --> 01:30:35,956
My ex-wife didn’t even go to college.
My new wife has two college degrees

1541
01:30:35,976 --> 01:30:38,170
doesn’t use ‘em and is
still paying for ‘em.

1542
01:30:38,190 --> 01:30:41,499
I think that’s a win
in my ex-wife’s column.

1543
01:30:41,519 --> 01:30:44,210
And they’re different, you know,
my new wife is uh, she’s very beautiful.

1544
01:30:44,230 --> 01:30:46,337
She’s very tall.
She’s smart, she’s funny,

1545
01:30:46,357 --> 01:30:47,588
she loves me more
than anybody ever has.

1546
01:30:47,608 --> 01:30:49,757
And she’s, tall,
she’s this tall.

1547
01:30:49,777 --> 01:30:52,280
And my ex-wife is…

1548
01:30:53,990 --> 01:30:56,784
Closer to Hell. Anyway.

1549
01:31:02,915 --> 01:31:06,065
That’s how I say
shorter, anyway.

1550
01:31:06,085 --> 01:31:08,067
So, we’re all just
watching my daughter

1551
01:31:08,087 --> 01:31:09,650
like, what’s gonna happen here,

1552
01:31:09,670 --> 01:31:12,681
and we see my daughter,
while the pastor’s holding the rose,

1553
01:31:12,701 --> 01:31:15,199
she just mouths,

1554
01:31:15,219 --> 01:31:17,805
“I have two moms.”

1555
01:31:26,689 --> 01:31:29,751
Yeah, California, you think they
would’ve thought about that.

1556
01:31:32,069 --> 01:31:34,260
“I need another rose.”

1557
01:31:34,280 --> 01:31:35,887
And the pastor kinda
shakes the rose angrily.

1558
01:31:35,907 --> 01:31:37,138
And the kids behind my
daugh-everything stopped.

1559
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:40,995
The kids are like

1560
01:31:44,415 --> 01:31:47,783
And my daughter goes – my daughter
just stands her ground and goes,

1561
01:31:47,803 --> 01:31:51,694
“I haaave TWO MOMS.

1562
01:31:51,714 --> 01:31:57,533
I NEEEEED ANOTHER ROSE!”

1563
01:31:57,553 --> 01:31:59,410
And we hear the pastor go,

1564
01:31:59,430 --> 01:32:02,497
“We don’t have any EXTRAS.

1565
01:32:02,517 --> 01:32:06,459
TAKE IT.”

1566
01:32:06,479 --> 01:32:09,086
And there’s this beat, and then my
daughter looks him right in the eye,

1567
01:32:09,106 --> 01:32:10,713
snatches the rose, holds it up,

1568
01:32:10,733 --> 01:32:14,278
and RIPS IT IN HALF.

1569
01:32:19,325 --> 01:32:22,433
She walks down the center
steps, man.

1570
01:32:22,453 --> 01:32:24,393
And I KNOW what everybody
was thinking in the church,

1571
01:32:24,413 --> 01:32:26,395
“Oh well, there’s the Titus kid.

1572
01:32:26,415 --> 01:32:29,315
Wow. Wow.

1573
01:32:29,335 --> 01:32:34,820
Who had their money on
‘rips the rose in half?’”

1574
01:32:34,840 --> 01:32:36,781
And as my daughter is
walking down the aisle,

1575
01:32:36,801 --> 01:32:39,492
she’s snapping the stem. She takes
half the petals and rips ‘em off.

1576
01:32:39,512 --> 01:32:41,247
Takes the other
half, rips ‘em off.

1577
01:32:41,267 --> 01:32:46,457
She walks up and hands her
two moms this destroyed rose.

1578
01:32:46,477 --> 01:32:48,292
And hugged them.

1579
01:32:48,312 --> 01:32:50,294
And I thought - My God…

1580
01:32:50,314 --> 01:32:54,090
in an impossible situation,
in front of a live audience,

1581
01:32:54,110 --> 01:32:59,053
this kid had the
calm, the courage

1582
01:32:59,073 --> 01:33:02,765
and the love to make sure no
one got their feelings hurt.

1583
01:33:02,785 --> 01:33:08,271
OR, I have raised
the biggest a-hole…

1584
01:33:08,291 --> 01:33:12,525
who just wanted to make a point about
the shitty divorce we put her through.

1585
01:33:12,545 --> 01:33:14,771
Like, by the way… this
rose, it’s a metaphor.

1586
01:33:14,791 --> 01:33:17,356
It’s me. Snap. There you go!
You happy now?

1587
01:33:17,376 --> 01:33:24,453
I want you to know that everybody in this area
just bought future therapist a ski-boat, suck it!

1588
01:33:24,473 --> 01:33:26,664
Now,

1589
01:33:26,684 --> 01:33:30,668
I hope that’s not it.

1590
01:33:30,688 --> 01:33:34,463
But, I’d be ok with that too.

1591
01:33:34,483 --> 01:33:35,756
Now, that’s a great story.

1592
01:33:35,776 --> 01:33:37,592
Now, if you have a kid, and you think
my kid would never be that cool.

1593
01:33:37,612 --> 01:33:39,844
My kid will never have that
kind of insight or calm…

1594
01:33:39,864 --> 01:33:41,803
you’re wrong.
Just keep doing your job.

1595
01:33:41,823 --> 01:33:44,056
Because… this… that
was a girl that’s 13.

1596
01:33:44,076 --> 01:33:49,687
At 11, my daughter’s the same kid
that got the cops called on me.

1597
01:33:49,707 --> 01:33:51,901
I’m not sayn' they
didn’t need to be called,

1598
01:33:51,921 --> 01:33:53,714
I’m just sayin she
made it happen.

1599
01:33:57,423 --> 01:33:59,780
Now, I have my kids 50/50.

1600
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:02,033
Which means my ex has them for a
week, and I have ‘em for a week.

1601
01:34:02,053 --> 01:34:06,037
So my ex has 7 days to poison their
minds, and make them HATE me…

1602
01:34:06,057 --> 01:34:07,830
and then I have 7 days…

1603
01:34:07,850 --> 01:34:11,854
to do absolutely
nothing, your honor.

1604
01:34:14,815 --> 01:34:16,797
But I will admit this… my
ex-wife and I are infants.

1605
01:34:16,817 --> 01:34:18,132
We are immature idiots.

1606
01:34:18,152 --> 01:34:19,683
We, we can’t get along at all.

1607
01:34:19,703 --> 01:34:22,928
We can’t even drop the kids
off at each-others’ houses.

1608
01:34:22,948 --> 01:34:24,919
The court has said
that we fight so bad,

1609
01:34:24,939 --> 01:34:26,623
that they only way
we get the kids

1610
01:34:26,643 --> 01:34:30,811
is go to McDonald’s and
have a hostage transfer.

1611
01:34:30,831 --> 01:34:34,440
It’s like getting your kids out
of North Korea every Monday.

1612
01:34:34,460 --> 01:34:36,776
I pull up on the South side of the
lot, she pulls up on the North side.

1613
01:34:36,796 --> 01:34:37,736
I stand in front of my car,

1614
01:34:37,756 --> 01:34:39,644
she puts the kids
in front of her car,

1615
01:34:39,664 --> 01:34:42,948
then I gotta hold up
the child support check.

1616
01:34:42,968 --> 01:34:47,036
She sends my son over, cuz she doesn’t
think he’s smart enough to escape.

1617
01:34:47,056 --> 01:34:49,955
I think he’s a
double-agent, frankly.

1618
01:34:49,975 --> 01:34:52,875
He walks back,
she checks the amount,

1619
01:34:52,895 --> 01:34:55,628
and the kids clasp hands

1620
01:34:55,648 --> 01:34:58,923
and slowly make their way,

1621
01:34:58,943 --> 01:35:00,066
across the Mickey DMZ.

1622
01:35:10,204 --> 01:35:13,854
So, I show up one
morning at ‘the drop’

1623
01:35:13,874 --> 01:35:16,482
and as I get out of the car, my daughter’s
already out of her mom’s car yelling at me.

1624
01:35:16,502 --> 01:35:18,484
She… and I get out and… I
go, “What?”

1625
01:35:18,504 --> 01:35:20,934
And she goes,
“I’m not going with you today, dad.

1626
01:35:20,954 --> 01:35:23,395
Mom’s been quiet all
week, and she said that,

1627
01:35:23,415 --> 01:35:26,242
if I leave,
she’s gonna go crazy,

1628
01:35:26,262 --> 01:35:28,577
and she doesn’t know,
so I can’t leave cuz she’s upset,

1629
01:35:28,597 --> 01:35:29,538
SO I’M NOT GOING WITH YOU!”

1630
01:35:29,558 --> 01:35:31,497
And, I learned something with
kids early on. Don’t yell at ‘em.

1631
01:35:31,517 --> 01:35:33,999
Can’t yell at ‘em.
If it worked I would do it ALLLL day long.

1632
01:35:34,019 --> 01:35:38,212
But it doesn’t. And if you yell too
much, eventually they get your frequency.

1633
01:35:38,232 --> 01:35:43,926
And all of ‘em, have this weird
internal Bose noise cancelling system.

1634
01:35:43,946 --> 01:35:46,395
And once they get your yell
frequency, it’s over.

1635
01:35:46,415 --> 01:35:49,473
To them, you just sound like
a Yamaha way in the distance.

1636
01:35:49,493 --> 01:35:52,434
“I TOLD YOU KIDS TO TURN THIS
TELEVISION OFF AND CLEAN YOUR

1637
01:35:52,454 --> 01:35:53,394
ROOMS AND... ANOTHER…

1638
01:35:53,414 --> 01:36:02,027
…”

1639
01:36:02,047 --> 01:36:04,547
I have stood in front of
my children and realized,

1640
01:36:04,567 --> 01:36:09,243
wow, they’re watching
television THROUGH me right now.

1641
01:36:09,263 --> 01:36:12,288
So as a parent you need
to develop a second voice.

1642
01:36:12,308 --> 01:36:13,497
I call it the you’re dead voice,

1643
01:36:13,517 --> 01:36:15,166
there’s a lot of dads here that
know what I’m talking about.

1644
01:36:15,186 --> 01:36:16,333
It’s a voice you only
use once in a while,

1645
01:36:16,353 --> 01:36:19,336
when you have a big life lesson a big
life download. That’s what you use it for.

1646
01:36:19,356 --> 01:36:21,338
First time I used it on my son,

1647
01:36:21,358 --> 01:36:22,299
he was 7

1648
01:36:22,319 --> 01:36:26,719
my voice is a combination of Barry
White, Clint Eastwood and Darth Vader.

1649
01:36:26,739 --> 01:36:27,679
And we caught him lying.

1650
01:36:27,699 --> 01:36:31,474
And he was at the age where
he thought he invented lying.

1651
01:36:31,494 --> 01:36:33,142
Turns out, if you don’t tell
them what really happened,

1652
01:36:33,162 --> 01:36:35,686
you could get away
with anything.

1653
01:36:35,706 --> 01:36:36,854
He’s such an idiot.

1654
01:36:36,874 --> 01:36:38,564
And we had him, it was like CSI.

1655
01:36:38,584 --> 01:36:40,608
Here’s the blood spatter,
here’s the fingerprints, here…

1656
01:36:40,628 --> 01:36:42,312
he’s like, “NOPE!
I didn’t do it.”

1657
01:36:42,332 --> 01:36:45,112
And I lost it, I just went,

1658
01:36:45,132 --> 01:36:48,616
“DID YOU LIE TO ME?

1659
01:36:48,636 --> 01:36:52,036
OH, I’M GONNA ASK
YOU ONE MORE TIME.

1660
01:36:52,056 --> 01:36:55,247
DID YOU LIE TO YOUR FATHER?

1661
01:36:55,267 --> 01:36:56,124
DID YOU??!!”

1662
01:36:56,144 --> 01:36:57,981
He came off the
ground, it was great.

1663
01:36:58,001 --> 01:37:00,808
His legs shot up,
I know he pooped himself a little bit.

1664
01:37:02,858 --> 01:37:07,196
I can’t prove it, because he was
wearing two pairs of underwear

1665
01:37:10,658 --> 01:37:12,701
but I suspect!

1666
01:37:15,371 --> 01:37:17,186
So my daughter’s standing in the
middle of McDonald’s parking lot.

1667
01:37:17,206 --> 01:37:18,437
Screaming at me.

1668
01:37:18,457 --> 01:37:19,855
And I just went,

1669
01:37:19,875 --> 01:37:21,816
“GET IN THE CAR.”

1670
01:37:21,836 --> 01:37:24,030
She goes,
“NO!” But her body started moving.

1671
01:37:24,630 --> 01:37:26,773
That’s when you know
I got the voice right.

1672
01:37:26,793 --> 01:37:30,741
When you override their nervous
system… that’s the voice.

1673
01:37:30,761 --> 01:37:33,925
She goes, “I’m not getting in
the car.” Poof. She’s in the car.

1674
01:37:33,945 --> 01:37:39,458
My son’s been in the car three
minutes,

1675
01:37:39,478 --> 01:37:41,710
And now, my ex-wife says
something horrible to me

1676
01:37:41,730 --> 01:37:43,295
and I say something horrible back,
we get in the car and I’m like,

1677
01:37:43,315 --> 01:37:45,214
“God this is so stupid,
two adults can’t even get this handled,”

1678
01:37:45,234 --> 01:37:47,424
and I’m grumbling to myself,
and I go to start my car,

1679
01:37:47,444 --> 01:37:49,426
and my daughter gets her
facilities back and goes,

1680
01:37:49,446 --> 01:37:51,011
“I’m not going with
you, I told you, Dad.”

1681
01:37:51,031 --> 01:37:52,638
And she gets out of the
car, and I had enough.

1682
01:37:52,658 --> 01:37:54,291
I pick up the phone, I dial 911.

1683
01:37:54,311 --> 01:37:59,770
Because LAPD has
SO much free time.

1684
01:37:59,790 --> 01:38:01,729
“911 emergency,
what’s your emergency?”

1685
01:38:01,749 --> 01:38:05,985
“Uh, yeah.
We’re having a custody situation,

1686
01:38:06,005 --> 01:38:09,655
over here at the McDonald’s

1687
01:38:09,675 --> 01:38:11,866
on Ventura and Sherman Oaks…”

1688
01:38:11,886 --> 01:38:13,927
And here’s when I know
I’ve gone too far.

1689
01:38:13,947 --> 01:38:15,661
I hear the 911 operator go,

1690
01:38:15,681 --> 01:38:19,415
“Ughhhhh…

1691
01:38:19,435 --> 01:38:21,272
Sir, are the children
in any danger?”

1692
01:38:21,292 --> 01:38:26,505
“Uh, yeah… cuz they’re with
a bitch in my opinion.”

1693
01:38:26,525 --> 01:38:30,050
And again you just
hear, “Ughhhhhh…

1694
01:38:30,070 --> 01:38:32,622
Alright, sir,
I will send a unit and two uniforms.”

1695
01:38:32,642 --> 01:38:36,265
“Yeah, make sure there’s people
in those uniforms, thank YOU.”

1696
01:38:36,285 --> 01:38:38,225
Just an idiot.

1697
01:38:38,245 --> 01:38:41,312
Now, my daughters been standing by the
door listening on the Bluetooth in my car,

1698
01:38:41,332 --> 01:38:43,606
and she realized it’s getting serious.
She gets back in the car.

1699
01:38:43,626 --> 01:38:45,065
“Fine, dad, I’ll go with you.”

1700
01:38:45,085 --> 01:38:46,567
We start driving to the
house and I’m just so…

1701
01:38:46,587 --> 01:38:48,068
and by the time I get to
the house I’m at an 11,

1702
01:38:48,088 --> 01:38:50,321
I’m so pissed off.
And I walk in,

1703
01:38:50,341 --> 01:38:52,031
I grab her backpack and I put it
in front of her bedroom and I go,

1704
01:38:52,051 --> 01:38:54,199
“You’re grounded, that’s it,
get in your room right now!”

1705
01:38:54,219 --> 01:38:56,209
And my new wife is
standing right there.

1706
01:38:56,229 --> 01:39:00,414
My new wife – who’s never had
children and she married me.

1707
01:39:00,434 --> 01:39:04,001
So she’s livin’ the nightmare!

1708
01:39:04,021 --> 01:39:06,266
To you people in here
tonight that decided to

1709
01:39:06,286 --> 01:39:09,882
marry into someone
else’s horribly broken,

1710
01:39:09,902 --> 01:39:13,052
destructed divorced family…

1711
01:39:13,072 --> 01:39:15,262
I want you to know something.

1712
01:39:15,282 --> 01:39:19,308
You are heroes. Heroes.

1713
01:39:19,328 --> 01:39:23,395
Yes. Yes. Yeah.

1714
01:39:23,415 --> 01:39:27,753
And I mean that in a Special
Olympics kind of way…

1715
01:39:30,072 --> 01:39:32,196
Cuz you’re obviously
very sweet and loving,

1716
01:39:32,216 --> 01:39:36,116
not that smart,
yet you all deserve metals.

1717
01:39:36,136 --> 01:39:39,932
Yes you do! Yes you do!!

1718
01:39:42,851 --> 01:39:45,084
So, she sees me flipping
out, and she goes,

1719
01:39:45,104 --> 01:39:46,377
“What’s the matter?” And
here’s what I said, I went,

1720
01:39:46,397 --> 01:39:49,421
“OH! This… you… and she comes
out… ‘I can’t’... AHHHH!!”

1721
01:39:49,441 --> 01:39:51,465
And I just walk away.
I was SO PISSED.

1722
01:39:51,485 --> 01:39:52,591
I couldn’t speak English.

1723
01:39:52,611 --> 01:39:54,218
And I walk into the
kitchen, I’m just mad…

1724
01:39:54,238 --> 01:39:55,636
I go, “Give me a second!”
And I open the cupboard,

1725
01:39:55,656 --> 01:39:56,762
I grab the first
glass that was there,

1726
01:39:56,782 --> 01:39:58,764
it was just this weird
round, stemless wine glass,

1727
01:39:58,784 --> 01:40:00,641
and I grab some pomegranate
juice and I fill it up –

1728
01:40:00,661 --> 01:40:03,018
I started juicing, Ahhh,
because kids give you tumors!

1729
01:40:03,038 --> 01:40:05,688
And I put it in and I put
it back and I close the door

1730
01:40:05,708 --> 01:40:07,272
and I start walking back to my new
wife, I’m like,

1731
01:40:07,292 --> 01:40:08,774
“You won’t believe
what just happened.

1732
01:40:08,794 --> 01:40:09,900
I get out of the car, she’s like

1733
01:40:09,920 --> 01:40:12,569
‘I can’t go with you’ and her mom’s behind
her just shoveling crap on top of her,”

1734
01:40:12,589 --> 01:40:14,196
and as I get to my new wife,

1735
01:40:14,216 --> 01:40:15,739
we hear

1736
01:40:15,759 --> 01:40:18,909
and I go to the peephole,

1737
01:40:18,929 --> 01:40:22,621
and there’s two LAPD
officers standing outside.

1738
01:40:22,641 --> 01:40:24,790
And they’re standing
like cops stand,

1739
01:40:24,810 --> 01:40:27,938
when they want you to
know that they’re cops.

1740
01:40:37,906 --> 01:40:41,056
What are you a human
puffer-fish, what are you doing?

1741
01:40:41,076 --> 01:40:44,830
I just kept waiting for one to
go, “BAAAA-KAAAAAW!”

1742
01:40:53,338 --> 01:40:56,447
So I open the door and it
gets real serious real fast.

1743
01:40:56,467 --> 01:40:58,115
I go, “Yeah,” He goes, “Mr.
Titus?” I go, “Yeah.”

1744
01:40:58,135 --> 01:40:59,575
“Step back, right now,

1745
01:40:59,595 --> 01:41:01,702
where’s your daughter.
We were told you’re abusing your daughter.

1746
01:41:01,722 --> 01:41:03,078
WHERE IS YOUR DAUGHTER?”

1747
01:41:03,098 --> 01:41:04,329
I look behind them,

1748
01:41:04,349 --> 01:41:06,623
and sitting in the back seat of
the cop car, in front of my house,

1749
01:41:06,643 --> 01:41:11,295
is my ex-wife. Which is not the last time my
ex-wife’s gonna be in the back of a cop car.

1750
01:41:11,315 --> 01:41:14,735
I’m working on that now…

1751
01:41:15,570 --> 01:41:16,551
I go, “What’s this about?”

1752
01:41:16,571 --> 01:41:18,177
And he goes, “Where is your
daughter, RIGHT NOW?”

1753
01:41:18,197 --> 01:41:21,310
And I don’t realize it,
but I’m standing in front of the cops,

1754
01:41:21,330 --> 01:41:23,307
holding a wine glass,

1755
01:41:23,327 --> 01:41:27,936
full of red liquid, to the top.

1756
01:41:27,956 --> 01:41:30,731
And it’s noon.

1757
01:41:30,751 --> 01:41:36,612
Cuz nothing says abusive father more
than a little side of raging alcoholic!

1758
01:41:36,632 --> 01:41:37,572
And I go,
“Can we talk…” He goes,

1759
01:41:37,592 --> 01:41:38,822
“RIGHT NOW, WHERE IS SHE?”

1760
01:41:38,842 --> 01:41:40,449
I go, “She’s in her room, right
there,” and I’m starting to get shaky,

1761
01:41:40,469 --> 01:41:41,867
“She’s right there, go talk to
her, she’s right there.”

1762
01:41:41,887 --> 01:41:44,578
And they go,
“You stand right here.”

1763
01:41:44,598 --> 01:41:46,330
And the cops go to the door,

1764
01:41:46,350 --> 01:41:47,581
and they look back at
my new wife and they go,

1765
01:41:47,601 --> 01:41:52,397
“Would you go in with us?” Because even
the LAPD is afraid of an 11-year-old.

1766
01:41:55,734 --> 01:41:57,841
And they walk in,
and they do stuff for like 7 minutes,

1767
01:41:57,861 --> 01:41:59,843
and... be cool to your kids.

1768
01:41:59,863 --> 01:42:01,762
Don’t be the parent
that causes the psycho.

1769
01:42:01,782 --> 01:42:04,181
Cuz, despite your
daughter, if she wanted to,

1770
01:42:04,201 --> 01:42:06,308
she could have sailed me down the river, she
could have made up some lie, but she didn’t.

1771
01:42:06,328 --> 01:42:08,602
She said, “No,
Dad just… picked me up.

1772
01:42:08,622 --> 01:42:11,174
Mom got me amped up,
it’s my fault, I flipped out.”

1773
01:42:11,194 --> 01:42:15,400
So, cops come back out.
But they’re still all roostered up on me.

1774
01:42:15,420 --> 01:42:16,900
And I go, “Is everything ok?”

1775
01:42:16,920 --> 01:42:21,359
and they, “No, it is not ok, where’s your
son? We’re told you’re abusing your son also.”

1776
01:42:23,804 --> 01:42:27,454
and here’s my problem…

1777
01:42:27,474 --> 01:42:31,959
that’s fair.

1778
01:42:31,979 --> 01:42:35,462
Here’s one of my problems…

1779
01:42:35,482 --> 01:42:36,797
I was raised in a lot of stress.

1780
01:42:36,817 --> 01:42:40,425
My mom was mentally ill, I used to go visit her
at mental institutions when I was a little kid.

1781
01:42:40,445 --> 01:42:43,554
My dad got divorced six times,
three of them before I was 10,

1782
01:42:43,574 --> 01:42:46,431
so at one point,
while being raised by my dad…

1783
01:42:46,451 --> 01:42:51,228
there was so much alimony going
out… food got a little bit rare.

1784
01:42:51,248 --> 01:42:52,771
But my father never let on…

1785
01:42:52,791 --> 01:42:55,065
unlike today, where everyone’s
depressed, “I have depression…”

1786
01:42:55,085 --> 01:42:56,025
My dad never let on once.

1787
01:42:56,045 --> 01:42:57,985
At one point, we have my second,
my dad’s second wife cleaned us out.

1788
01:42:58,005 --> 01:42:59,736
We had just had a,
we had rubber raft for a couch

1789
01:42:59,756 --> 01:43:01,899
and all my dad would
do, is cracking jokes.

1790
01:43:01,919 --> 01:43:06,160
“Hey, we’re gonna sleep in
the Titanic tonight, ha ha.”

1791
01:43:06,180 --> 01:43:07,870
Never stopped being funny,
no matter how weird…

1792
01:43:07,890 --> 01:43:09,727
I knew as a kid… I
knew it was weird.

1793
01:43:09,747 --> 01:43:14,293
You know, cuz I had friends who
had other... you guys have shit!

1794
01:43:14,313 --> 01:43:16,628
But he never let on that it was
weird, and I love him for that.

1795
01:43:16,648 --> 01:43:18,587
You know,
he never let on it was weird.

1796
01:43:18,607 --> 01:43:23,594
So, as a child, I learned very early, that
in a high-pressure, high-stress situation…

1797
01:43:23,614 --> 01:43:25,866
you’re supposed to be funny.

1798
01:43:33,373 --> 01:43:37,566
But sometimes the LAPD…

1799
01:43:37,586 --> 01:43:41,737
doesn’t get it.

1800
01:43:41,757 --> 01:43:43,906
Now this’ll sound like a joke
– this is what I actually said,

1801
01:43:43,926 --> 01:43:45,782
I turn and I go,
“SON, GET OUT HERE.

1802
01:43:45,802 --> 01:43:49,514
I WANT YOU TO TELL THE
COPS HOW OFTEN I BEAT YOU.”

1803
01:43:56,021 --> 01:44:00,923
Not realizing – Oh, wow… I just
gave them testimony… that’s amazing!

1804
01:44:00,943 --> 01:44:03,425
And the cops don’t smile at all,
but my son, thank God for my son,

1805
01:44:03,445 --> 01:44:05,997
my son knows me so well…
my son walks out and goes,

1806
01:44:06,017 --> 01:44:09,890
“Ok, dad. I’ll tell ‘em.”

1807
01:44:09,910 --> 01:44:13,038
Yeah, the older cop goes,
“Why doesn’t he have pants on?”

1808
01:44:16,667 --> 01:44:19,483
“We’ve been home 9 minutes,
what are you doin’?”

1809
01:44:19,503 --> 01:44:22,402
“I was getting ready
to go play soccer.”

1810
01:44:22,422 --> 01:44:23,647
“Why did you stop that?”

1811
01:44:23,667 --> 01:44:26,323
I started watching trick
videos on Youtube.”

1812
01:44:26,343 --> 01:44:27,491
“Really?

1813
01:44:27,511 --> 01:44:30,786
In the middle of changing
clothes, you got side-tracked?

1814
01:44:30,806 --> 01:44:32,766
Do you know what makes me CRA...

1815
01:44:36,770 --> 01:44:39,856
Could you please
put on some pants?

1816
01:44:44,069 --> 01:44:46,905
He is such a scamp, is he not?”

1817
01:44:51,034 --> 01:44:53,311
Son disappears,
comes back with some shorts on

1818
01:44:53,331 --> 01:44:55,313
walks into the room with the cops,
and right before the door closed, I hear,

1819
01:44:55,333 --> 01:44:57,541
“What is that smell?” click.

1820
01:45:01,461 --> 01:45:03,527
And I don’t know what
my son said to the cops…

1821
01:45:03,547 --> 01:45:04,445
my daughter was
in there a while…

1822
01:45:04,465 --> 01:45:06,196
she was in there like 7
minutes, it was tense.

1823
01:45:06,216 --> 01:45:08,156
My son was in there less than a minute.
I don’t know what happened.

1824
01:45:08,176 --> 01:45:10,728
All I can guess is they
went, “What’d your dad do?”

1825
01:45:10,748 --> 01:45:13,453
“Dad’s cool. ”

1826
01:45:13,473 --> 01:45:17,416
and the cops went “Ugghhh.”

1827
01:45:17,436 --> 01:45:19,501
Cops come back out and
they’re not mad at me anymore.

1828
01:45:19,521 --> 01:45:21,420
They’re pissed now, but different.
It's different.

1829
01:45:21,440 --> 01:45:25,216
And the young guy walks right up to
me, gets this close to me, and he goes,

1830
01:45:25,236 --> 01:45:30,137
“Mr. Titus,
I want you to know something…”

1831
01:45:30,157 --> 01:45:34,578
“If THAT was MY ex-wife…

1832
01:45:39,166 --> 01:45:41,793
I’d be drinking this early too.”

1833
01:45:43,003 --> 01:45:45,297
Thank you guys so much!

1834
01:45:49,384 --> 01:45:50,677
Thank you guys!!

1835
01:45:52,471 --> 01:45:54,056
You guys were amazing!!
