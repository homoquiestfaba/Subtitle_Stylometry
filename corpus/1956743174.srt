00:02:29,175 --> 00:02:33,486
Hello, confirmed availability

Armed with small arms.

7
00:02:3 6,056 --> 00:02:37,343
We are leaving.

8
00:03:12,461 --> 00:03:15,884
Let's get the hell out of here!
Come on, let's run!

9
00:03:15,934 --> 00:03:20,140
We leave, we leave. Get out of here!
We are running!

Good morning. Speaks information

thirteen
00:08:29,230 --> 00:08:34,408
Store weapons according to the rules.

14
00:08:34,653 --> 00:08:38,190
Clean weapons are safe weapons.

fifteen
00:08:39,046 --> 00:08:41,360
Subject refuses to respond.

16
00:08:41,788 --> 00:08:44,658
Remove his barcode and enter it
to the dead list.

17
00:08:59,929 --> 00:09:03,853
This is the last one we arrested
at the old missile complex "Sabina".

18
00:09:03,903 --> 00:09:05,950
Raise your hand for identification.

19
00:09:08,063 --> 00:09:10,275
Raise your hand for identification.

20
00:09:13,771 --> 00:09:17,053
She has no barcode.
She is not registered.

21
00:09:17,447 --> 00:09:19,575
What is this costume made of?

22
00:09:20,066 --> 00:09:21,694
The scanner just goes crazy.

23
00:09:23,165 --> 00:09:24,365
Costume.

24
00:09:24,407 --> 00:09:29,102
- Some ... metal.
- Metal.

25
00:09:29,602 --> 00:09:30,90 7
Do you have a name

26
00:09:32,493 --> 00:09:36,164
Metal. Costume.

27
00:09:37,470 --> 00:09:40,069
Yes, I'm interested in yours
metal suit.

28
00:09:40,119 --> 00:09:42,996
This is some kind of uniform
your group?

29th
00:09:44,289 --> 00:09:47, 764
Metal, braid box.

thirty
00:09:50,991 --> 00:09:55,092
- Do you have any documents?
“No, but there is some property.”

31
00:10:00,061 --> 00:10:02,586
Why do you need these photos?

32
00:10:03,317 --> 00:10:05,101
Is this some kind of code?

33
00:10:05,151 --> 00:10:08,983
They serve as a pass for someone
who is waiting for you?

34
00:10:09,603 --> 00:10:12,243
Why are you carrying these photographs with you?

35
00:10:12,577 --> 00:10:15,144
Photo.

36
00:10:17,774 --> 00:10:20,070
Sub-in.

37
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:23,299
She is either short-sighted or almost dumb.

38
00:10:24,378 --> 00:10:26,121
Or very smart ...

39
00:10:30,860 --> 00:10:32,931
Subject has no barcode.

40
00:10:33,844 --> 00:10:39,648
Unregistered, signs of mental
deviations, add to the list of deceased.

41
00:10:40,077 --> 00:10:44,242
No, wait a minute.
Let's do it differently.

42
00:10:45,848 --> 00:10:47,658
Send her under surveillance.

43
00:10:47,708 --> 00:10:53,047
Complete psychological and medical
examination. Take off your clothes and carry out analyzes.

44
00:10:53,097 --> 00:10:58,371
And bring her things to the investigation department,
I'm already late.

45
00:10:58,583 --> 00:11:02,693
Her file. She has no barcode,
I need to somehow name the dossier.

46
00:11:03,165 --> 00:11:06,540
“Was she found at the old Sabina complex?”
- Yes, sir.

47
00:11:07,193 --> 00:11:09,019
So call it - Sabina.

48
00:11:24,247 --> 00:11:29,743
“It costs money, guys.”
- Of money. Are you asking for money for this liquid shit?

49
00:12:27,830 --> 00:12:31,597
- Hey baby, check it out. We have a business here.
- Oh, thanks, cool.

fifty
00:12:44,745 --> 00:12:48,740
- How are you?
- There will be questions, please contact.

51
00:12:59,061 --> 00:13:01,523
If I promise to read it,
can i buy you a drink?

52
00:13:01,573 --> 00:13:03,594
Sorry, I don’t drink, I have a job.

53
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,795
Well, when will you finish the job?
Maybe ... maybe tomorrow?

54
00:13:10,541 --> 00:13:13,149
Or on Thursday?
Every Thursday I am free.

55
00:13:16,003 --> 00:13:19,720
Or maybe after the day after tomorrow?

56
00:13:21,456 --> 00:13:23,445
This is a seductive offer.

57
00:13:24,782 --> 00:13:30,172
Don't be so busy
could have agreed.

58
00:13:31,874 --> 00:13:35,529
“Only the revolution worries, no entertainment?”
- And there is.

59
00:13:37,896 --> 0 0:13:42,445
Well, if you ever want to become
mother of my children, find me, okay?

60
00:13:43,833 --> 00:13:46,180
Okay.

61
00:13:46.230 --> 00:13:50.558
But, a man who wants children,
should think about the future. If he is a man ...

62
00:13:52.5 19 --> 00:13:53,927
Why are you doing this?

63
00:13:57,851 --> 00:14:00,115
For the sake of our unborn children.

64
00:14:11,103 --> 00:14:12,366
Dumb kids.

65
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:15,214
We’d better sit at home,
and don’t give out that shit, right?

66
00:14:15.8 51 --> 00:14:17,207
Well, maybe that makes sense.

67
00:14:17,385 --> 00:14:21,141
I think no. In my opinion they are
just stupid kids and they need to stay at home.

68
00:15:04,763 --> 00:15:06,474
The disease!

69
00:15:06,652 --> 00:15:11,081
Black clouds, demons from the depths of hell!
Ask questions, gentlemen!

70
00:15:11,131 --> 00:15:15,703
Paramilitary larvae,
come from the void, from the ground!

71
00:15:15,836 --> 00:15:18,966
To devour our glorious society!

72
00:15:19,016 --> 00:15:22,806
Ask questions, maggots!
Ask questions!

73
00:15:23,558 --> 00:15:28,232
Ask questions, good people,
try to change. You should not...

74
00:16:20,535 --> 00:16:24,187
Oh - this is my warlike friend
I remember you last night.

75
00:16:24,980 --> 0 0:16:28,048
“How are you, buddy.” Do you need something?
- Get up.

76
00:16:28,892 --> 00:16:30,311
"Get up."

77
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:34,266
I already know it. Maybe you’ll come up with something new?
And I will try to remember.

78
00:17:10,200 --> 00:17:13,591
For some reason I have a hunch that you
here not to make me breakfast.

79
00:17:39,099 --> 00:17:44,481
Bring him to your senses. If you still think
that he's funny ... Let me know.

80
00:17:45.665 --> 00:17:47.585
I will not refuse again with him
to do it.

81
00:18:47,139 --> 00:18:51,136
Hello. Speaks information
Bureau of the Central Office.

82
00:18:51,208 --> 00:18:54,008
An anxiety of the first degree is declared.

83
00:19:57,675 --> 00:20:02,229
It’s a good idea to make an escape.
To know more how to get out of here.

84
00:20:02,376 --> 00:20:07,126
It's alright man, I researched this
the place when they brought me. Come on.

85
00:20:19,687 --> 00:20:21,472
Hush, lady, you and I are not enemies.

86
00:20:24,038 --> 00:20:27,325
What are you waiting for, just cut it down
do not pull.

87
00:20:29,140 --> 00:20:34,681
- So, I give you one last chance,
or close your mouth, or I will break your neck.
- Sa-bina.

88
00:20:35,151 --> 00:20:38,010
At least we know
that she speaks English.

89
00:20:47.225 --> 00 :20:49.301
Since we are here, we will perish together ...

90
00:20:49,358 --> 00:20:51,948
... let's call each other by name.
I am Danny Girard.

91
00:20:54,571 --> 00:20:56,491
Ah, you're not talkative, are you?

92
00:20:56,731 --> 00:21:00,164
Well, since you know how to get out of here,
maybe you can push a wheelbarrow to us?

93
00:21:00,488 --> 00:21:01,406
Wheelbarrow!

94
00:21:03,034 --> 00:21:07,284
Yes, a car. Well - a car, a car.
Okay, listen ...

95
00:21:07,541 --> 00:21:11,501
We are running - you are running.
We get up - you get up. Clear?

96
00:21:12,106 --> 00:21:13,421
Get out of here.

97
00:22:50,595 --> 00:22:54,143
Yeah, I'm alone against the whole world.
Hold on Go.

98
00:22:59,091 --> 00:23:00,521
I knew this was a reverse.

99
00:23:00,571 --> 00:23:03,620
Most importantly, be on your guard
if real problems begin.

100
00:23:38,454 --> 00:23:40,760
Please stop the car.

101
00:25:04,448 --> 00:25:07,036
Can you explain one thing to me?
What are you doing at all?

102
00:25:07,094 --> 00:25:10,393
This is my territory, I know
what’s what. You follow her.

103
00:25:13,962 --> 00:25:16,758
Wheelbarrow. Car.

104
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,368
Go to her, please.
Get busy.

105
00:25:53,106 --> 00:25:59,168
Okay, here's what I'll do. I will look for my people.
If you two want to act alone, ..

106
00:25:59,844 --> 00:26:03,454
... I will find something to do,
which suits you.

107
00:26:03,496 --> 00:26:10,776
You won’t have to deal with communication issues.
and be part of a battle group. Come on.

108
00:26:20,200 --> 00:26:23 , 498
On the roof of this building will need
put a sniper.

109
00:26:23,800 --> 00:26:26,409
One more here.
Here, mine the road.

110
00:26:26,701 --> 00:26:29,872
There will be about a hundred and three.
The first wave will go from here.

111
00:26:30,551 --> 00:26:33,045
We will act according to the same plan,
as in the northern sector.

112
00:26:33,786 --> 00:26:36,395
“All communication will be through you.”
- I'm listening.

113
00:26:37,845 --> 00:26:40,256
Few people just came up
to the main entrance.

114
00:26:41,388 --> 00:26:43,579
- Skip them.
- Skip them.

115
00:26:44,049 --> 00:26:45,917
Turn off the lights, close the door.

116
00:27:19,286 --> 00:27:21,597
Okay, okay, easy.

117
00:27:28,696 --> 00:27:32,352
If I have two hundred guys like you -
for a week I would deal with this mess.

118
00:27:34,498 --> 00:27:37,608
- Hi, Danny.
- Grubert.
“Good to see you again.”

119
00:27:40,263 --> 00:27:44,635
Someone is missing. Come out boy
everything is fine, we are at home.

120
00:27:44,915 --> 00:27:46,195
You have a cozy place.

121
00:28:01,091 --> 00:28:02,865
What the hell are you doing here?

122
00:28:04,665 --> 00:28:07,921
Funny colonel i just
I wanted to ask you the same thing.

123
00:28:08,276 --> 00:28:09,966
You are a useless fool.

124
00:28:10,143 --> 00:28:12,543
Appear when they are not waiting for you
and do not want to see.

125
00:28:13,190 --> 00:28:18,032
From reliable sources, I found out that you were killed
in New York during the food wars of the 98th.

126
00:28:18,082 --> 00:28:21,488
Do not trust the rumors
Colonel Slater.

127
00:28:21,597 --> 00:28:23,855
Forget about the colonel.
Just John Slater.

128
00:28:24,700 --> 00:28:27,726
Wait a minute, but you were always good
government guy, colonel.

129
00:28:27,776 --> 00:28:30,6 48
“Are you now a rebel?”
- Nothing but the form has changed.

130
00:28:31,582 --> 00:28:36,730
And you are the same. You never worried
other people's lives, you are not a team player.

131
00:28:37,269 --> 00:28:43,144
You were not expected here. We have already won.
I just direct them in the right direction.

132
00:28:43,405 --> 00:28:46,308
- And this direction you choose, Colonel?
- No, not me.

133
00:28:46,749 --> 00:28:52,819
The world was based on brilliant ideas.
People ceased to doubt the leaders - that’s what happened.

134
00:28:52,997 --> 00:28:56,870
World ruled by the military. I just want to,
so that everything becomes as before.

135
00:28:57,346 --> 00:29:00,654
- Alright, Colonel. We are leaving.
- The girl will stay.

136
00:29:00,704 --> 00:29:03,523
“Until we find out who she is and what she needs.”
- She is with me.

137
00:29:04,400 --> 00:29:06,841
It turns out that you spend some time here.

138
00:30:02,929 --> 00:30:07,082
I received a report from the Central Office:
the prisoners fled.

139
00:30:08,421 --> 00:30:10,43 0
Three prisoners participated in the escape.

140
00:30:12,084 --> 00:30:13,983
None of them are marked
especially important.

141
00:30:14,840 --> 00:30:20,626
Standard Award Details Indicated
for catching the runaways. That's all.

142
00:30:20,703 --> 00:30:24,4 18
They don't seem to consider your escape
they will not be looking for something important and seriously.

143
00:30:24,689 --> 00:30:27,803
Or maybe they want us to think
that it is not so important.

144
00:30:28,390 --> 00:30:31,178
We are also about information traders
did not hear.

145
00:30:31,228 --> 00:30:34,171
Everything suits me.
Show me where the door is, and I'll leave.

146
00:30:34,221 --> 00:30:35,492
Yes? Where to?

147
00:30:35,542 --> 00:30:37,762
Back to the interrogation room
to turn us in?

148
00:30:37,763 --> 00:30:40,662
Come on, man
if it weren’t for me, I wouldn’t be here.

149
00:30:40,712 --> 00:30:44,857
Or maybe if it weren’t for them - you won’t
would you arrest? Do you know what a setup is?

150
00:30:44,907 --> 00:30:47,868
- Yes, this is nonsense!
- Nonsense? Well, remember ...

151
00 :30:47,930 --> 00:30:51,657
You are both right, we cannot trust them.
But you can’t let them go until we find out.

152
00:30:51,770 --> 00:30:54,003
- How long does it take?
“Maybe two hours.”

153
00:30:54,139 --> 00:30:57,337
Let's do it. Just in case.

154
00:30:58,313 --> 00:31:01,934
Good morning. Speaks information
Bureau of the Central Office.

155
00:31:01,984 --> 00:31:05,821
Action order entered into force
in conditions of chemical pollution.

156
00:31:05,871 --> 00:31:09,003
Requires a detachment to work in conditions
chemical pollution.

157
00:31:17,284 --> 00:31:19,892
“Good to see you again.”
“Good to see you, sir.”

158
00:31:21,348 --> 00:31:24,739
I think it's worth getting rid
from extra ears.

159
00:31:27,014 --> 00:31:29,747
Hold it, be kind.
Listen up

160
00:31:30,635 --> 00:31:36,741
I only have a few minutes.
Now the army is not what it used to be.

161
00:31:37,228 --> 00:31:40,115
When you were an officer and served with me,
everything was different ...

162
00:31:40,165 --> 00:31:43 , 204
Now there is one paperwork everywhere.

163
00:31:43,464 --> 00:31:47,550
Politics, calculations.
Lunches, dinners.

164
00:31:48,708 --> 00:31:51,463
We are trying to change the course of history.

165
00:31:53,998 --> 00:31:58,300
“This was not what I expected when I started working.”
“Yes, sir, I can imagine.”

166
00:31:58,456 --> 00:31:59,362
So...

167
00:32:02,346 --> 00:32:04,595
About this escape.

168
00:32:06,171 --> 00:32:07,120
Escape?

169
00:32:07,684 --> 00:32:13,652
Looks like some talker overheard
that you let the three captives escape.

170
00:32:13,702 --> 00:32:16,611
“Sir, I reported it.”
- Please let me finish.
- Yes, sir.

171
00:32:16,669 --> 00:32:20,041
Have a little check
at first nothing unusual was found.

172
00:32:21.5 65 --> 00:32:25.339
But the woman ...
a woman interested them.

173
00:32:25,642 --> 00:32:29,649
- They began to check further.
“Sir, it was I who sent her for examination.”

174
00:32:29,931 --> 00:32:33,499
The effectiveness of your methods
and your dedication, I never doubted.

175
00:32:33,549 --> 00:32:35,889
But since I'm the head of security,

176
00:32:35,939 --> 00:32:39,709
everything received passes through me
information.

177
00:32:41,978 --> 00:32:45,423
I suspect you have not read the reports
about her physical and mental form?

178
00:32:45.567 --> 00:32:48.546
“No sir.”
“Did you know that her intelligence is twice as high ...”

179
00:32:48,619 --> 00:32:51,638
... all recorded
in the history of indicators?

180
00:32:52,160 --> 00:32:55, 802
Sir, I saw her only during
preliminary interrogation.

181
00:32:55,852 --> 00:32:59,151
How old do you think she is?

182
00:32:59,908 --> 00:33:06,419
A medical examination revealed
that her cells have no signs of aging.

183
0 0:33:06,617 --> 00:33:10,695
She has a newborn metabolism.

184
00:33:11,019 --> 00:33:15,991
The report also indicates that in her body
no signs of disease were found.

185
00:33:16,041 --> 00:33:20,050
She never got sick, even as a child,
there is not the slightest trace.

186
00:33:20,186 --> 00:33:23,796
And the clothes that were on her?

187
00:33:24,172 --> 00:33:28,570
The material has no analogues known to science.

188
00:33:28,727 --> 00:33:32,164
Humanity has not yet encountered such a thing.
We have a problem.

189
00:33:32,460 --> 00:33:37,283
You let the extremely dangerous
prisoner to escape.

190
00:33:37,333 --> 00:33:39,172
Now you have to find her.

191
00:33:40,072 --> 00:33:43,359
Find out who or what she is.

192
00:33:43,672 --> 00 :33:45,414
Find out what she needs ...

193
00:33:51,910 --> 00:33:53,893
So captain, I got access
to the dossier.

194
00:33:53,943 --> 00:33:59,776
Two more passwords and I can ...
get to our lady’s file.

195
00:34:00,221 --> 00:34:02,548
If it is stored with the rest.
If not...

196
00:34:02,684 --> 00:34:06,075
... try to look for him in business
security personnel.

197
00:34:07,009 --> 00:34:10,359
Come on, Gruber, do everything you can.
Why are you silent?

198
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:14,38 7
The central government considers you a spy.
Do you know what they do with spies?

199
00:34:16,126 --> 00:34:20,313
Sabina.
She is either short-sighted or almost dumb.

200
00:34:21,733 --> 00:34:23,705
Or very smart.

201
00:34:25,687 --> 00:34:27,305
The girl does not think anything at all.

202
00:34:27,440 --> 00:34:30,988
Since she is now with us,
we have two exits ...

203
00:34:31,038 --> 00:34:35,021
Let them grab her, set her free
or take it with you.

204
00:34:35,434 --> 00:34:38,345
I heard they don’t really stand on ceremony
with runaway prisoners.

205
00:34:38,773 --> 00:34:39,879
At last!

206
00:34:40,171 --> 00:34:42,127
I'm in the dossier of the arrested!

207
00:34:42,554 --> 00:34:44,975
Now I’ll look for the codes of prisoners cards.

208
00:34:45.779 --> 0 0:34:48.888
Unless, of course, you yourself remember them.

209
00:34:49,201 --> 00:34:51,403
I spent too little time there
to get a card.

210
00:34:52,373 --> 00:34:56,013
And you?
Do you remember what they called your dossier?

211
00:34:57,051 --> 00:35:01,629
Sabina. So call it.
Yes, sir.

212
00:35:03,093 --> 00:35:05,483
We have nothing to lose.
Try entering Sabina.

213
00:35:07,398 --> 00:35:09,265
The secret dossier is open.

214
00:35:09,315 --> 00:35:11,123
Oh shit, it worked!

215
00:35:11.26 9 --> 00:35:13.022
The dossier was transferred
to the central committee.

216
00:35:13,081 --> 00:35:15,534
What does it mean to put it
human language, slater?

217
00:35:15,635 --> 00:35:18,120
That means she's free
and is of utmost importance.

218
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:22,262
This information is only available to three
members of the Central Committee.

219
00:35:22,310 --> 00:35:24,599
“So we can't find out who she is?”
- Not.

220
00:35:24,735 --> 00:35:26,602
It just won't be that easy.

221
00:35:42,967 --> 00:35:44,981
Times are not easy now.

222
00:35:45,031 --> 00:35:48,721
Rebels are constantly organizing
groupings.

223
00:35:48,899 --> 00:35:53,008
As a percentage, it is noticeable
the number of deserters increased.

224
00:35:56,177 --> 00:35:58,421
Everyone's nerves are on edge, Quinn.

225
00:35:58,707 --> 00:36:01,844
Every day there are new rumors
new questions.

226
00:36:02,172 --> 00:36:05,835
Even my position is vulnerable.
It can affect us all.

227
00:36:06,042 --> 00:36:10 , 746
Queen, I want you to find this woman.
Wherever and with whoever she is.

228
00:36:10,850 --> 00:36:14,028
Arrest anyone
but I need her alive.

229
00:36:14,076 --> 00:36:17,763
I want to know what she does here
and I know that I can rely on you.

230
00:36:19,096 --> 00:36:20,351
This is extremely important.

231
00:36:30,474 --> 00:36:32,719
Hey, calm down, insolent.

232
00:36:44,218 --> 00:36:49,690
Find out where the headquarters is
rebel Brendt and bring it to me.

233
00:36:50,141 --> 00:36:51,256
Immediately.

234
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:02,918
People must see.

235
00:37:48,416 --> 00:37:51,864
Welcome to the information
Bureau of the Central Office.

236
00:37:51,984 --> 00:38:03,352
Barcode 537-9654, Level 2 clearance.
Report to prison no. 9.

237
00:38:03,431 --> 00:38:05,712
Expect further directions.

238
00:38:09,842 --> 00:38:13,656
Fire reached a temperature of 1000 degrees
on the celsius scale.

239
00:38:15,175 --> 00:38:17,434
And the result? Nothing!

240
00:3 8:17,554 --> 00:38:21,792
No burns, not even marks.
Not even hot to the touch.

241
00:38:21,912 --> 00:38:25,006
“The material seems to have absorbed all the heat.”
- Good.

242
00:38:25,126 --> 00:38:29,877
It turns out that we have an escaped prisoner,
heat resistant and with the brains of a professor?

243
00:38:31,138 --> 00:38:33,809
“Is that all you say?”
“That's all I will say.”

244
00:38:34,118 --> 00:38:38,431
I'm not here of my own free will, Queen.
And it does not make me happy.

245
00:38:38,901 --> 00:38:44,417
You show me the secret files
which no one knows about. This is even worse.

246
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,750
I feel it will bring
I'm in some kind of trouble.

247
00:38:48,864 --> 00:38:53,660
Queen, lay me everything
what do you know about the upcoming business.

248
00:38:53,957 --> 00:38:58, 253
We suspect the woman is an alien.

249
00:38:59,457 --> 00:39:02,861
- Yes, you are probably joking.
“There is no other explanation.”

250
00:39:03,213 --> 00:39:07,350
No one knows why she flew in
but she is here.

251
00:39:07,615 --> 00:39:11,077
And the Central Office wants to know
what for.

252
00:39:11,856 --> 00:39:16,605
I was assigned to find her
and I instruct you to do this directly.

253
00:39:16,684 --> 00:39:19,567
“A worthy reward awaits you.”
“Do you know how long this can take?”

254
00:39:19,684 --> 00:39:21,784
“She could be anywhere.”
- I do not think so.

255
00:39:23,828 --> 00:39:29,726
She escaped with two other prisoners
one of them is a famous rebel.

256
00:39:35,050 --> 00:39:36,722
Who's that?

257
00:39:38, 233 --> 00:39:41,931
Judging by the barcode,
it belongs to a can of Chinese mushrooms.

258
00:39:41,967 --> 00:39:45,848
Made in Taiwan, 1987.

259
00:39:55,840 --> 00:39:58,103
There is clearly some kind of mistake.

260
00:41:58,837 --> 00:42:02,652
Release date
www.kosmoaelita.com

261
00:42:58,837 --> 00:43:01,652
Remember, first of all we want
make an accident

262
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:05,423
... which will show the World Central
management that not everything is in their power.

263
00:43:05,595 --> 00:43:08,395
- Kick their asses.
- Yes, let's go!

264
00:43:11,246 --> 00:43:13,509
You should take a look at this.

265
00:43:22,092 --> 00:43:27,115
Wait a bit. Hubert received
access to the catalog of files.

266
00:43:29,057 --> 00:43:33,470
What is in your hands is the reason
that her files were transferred to a closed file.

267
00:43:33,589 --> 00:43:38,885
Come on, Slater. Central Office
specially left these files for you to stumble upon.

268
00:43:39,006 --> 00:43:41,694
“They're fooling you, man.”
- I do not think so.

269
00:43:41,814 --> 00:43:43,798
It is unlikely that they would become
risk secret files ...

270
00:43:43,868 --> 00:43:45,328
... just to get us
on the wrong track.

271
00:43:45,377 --> 00:43:48,454
Come on, Grub, is she that,
look like an alien from Pluto?

272
00:43:48,577 --> 00:43:55,278
“Did you know anyone from Pluto?”
“Good thing you asked.” There was one chick ...

273
00:43:56,252 --> 00:44:02,556
I don’t know if she understands our speech,
but if he understands, then he knows where we are.

274
00:44:03,614 --> 00:44:05,666
You are a serious threat to them.

275
00:44:06,153 --> 00:44:11,454
They will concentrate all their forces,
to find you, and that will betray us.

276
00:44:12,858 --> 00:44:13,890
I...

277
00:44:17,271 --> 00:44:25,066
I ... was ... not ready ... to talk ...

278
00:44:26,113 --> 00:44:34,194
I didn’t fully absorb the basics
your communication process.

279
00:44:35,197 --> 00:44:38,407
So guys are a joke, right?

280
00:44:39,094 --> 00:44:45,686
I also understand that your tribe
does not wish me harm.

281
00:44:46,460 --> 00:44:49,583
You are different from the rest.

282
00:44:50,758 --> 00:44:57,893
If you prepare questions,
I will answer them.

283
00:45:14,543 --> 00:45:18,413
It was decided to conduct an investigation.

284
00:45:19,108 --> 00:45:27,532
Discovered documents of earthlings showed
that your species has formed an equal society.

285
00:45:28,385 --> 00:45:31,050
Gruber, do you understand anything?

286
00:45:31,168 --> 00:45:35,448
Maybe she’s talking about NASA’s old probes,
created to search for extraterrestrial civilizations.

287
00:45:36,113 --> 00:45:38,213
They were launched a very long time ago.

288
00:45:38,677 --> 00:45:41,920
Gruber, and what kind of documents were
on these probes?

289
00:45:42,041 --> 00:45:47,115
Images...
No, you call them "photos."

290
00:45:47.235 --> 00:45:52.345
Description of the different peoples of the Earth.
Where and how they live.

291
00:45:53,133 --> 00:46:01,211
There were images of others ...
... the leaders of your tribes. Their peaceful meetings.

292
00:46:03,395 --> 00:46:07,729
But ... the photos do not reflect what
what i saw.

293
00:46:08,056 --> 00:46:13,196
- In recent years, there have been some changes.
- Explain to me the context of this statement.

294
00:46:13,636 --> 00:46:17,814
Some leaders stopped smiling
to each other ... They started to kill.

295
00:46:18,139 --> 00:46:24,176
But you can return to the former
conditions, if you replace these leaders.

296
00:46:24,296 --> 00:46:28,939
“Is that the reason for your clash with them?”
- Yes.

297
00:46:29,312 --> 00:46:36,109
Then we cannot learn anything from you.
We had the same conflict.

298
00:46:40,631 --> 00:46:47,881
Lady, I in no way want to hurt you.
But where did you leave your spaceship?

299
00:46:48,001 --> 00:46:50,976
Spaceship?

300
00:46:52,295 --> 00:46:54,415
He is asking,
how will you come back.

301
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:57,911
Energy cycle.

302
00:46:58,886 --> 00:47:03,147
The cycle is temporarily suspended until
until I continue it.

303
00:47:03,148 --> 00:47:05,477
He is in the place
where I ended up when I arrived on Earth.

304
00:47:05,597 --> 00:47:08,661
The place is called - "Sabina".

305
00:47:08,781 --> 00:47:12,101
The last question is what will happen
if you don’t come back?

306
00:47:12,292 --> 00:47:17,191
The energy cycle that will bring me back
home has already begun.

307
00:47:18,261 --> 00:47:23,648
If I don’t have time in time,
The next cycle will begin.

308
00:47:29,638 --> 00:47:33,478
I must return, or I will die.

309
00:48:19,886 --> 00:48:22,609
It would be better for them to catch this bitch.

310
00:48:33,297 --> 00:48:36,507
Leave me alone!
I have nothing!

311
00:48:38,930 --> 00:48:41,423
Ask questions, do you have any questions?

312
00:48:48,501 --> 00:48:51,137
This is a map of the former suburb.

313
00:48:51,257 --> 00:48:55,063
Red lines - metro scheme.
Now it is not used.

314
00:48:55,836 --> 00:48:59,160
This is the Sabina complex.

315
00:48:59,557 --> 00:49:03,573
If your statements are true
there you were arrested by members of the central administration.

316
00:49:03,689 --> 00:49:08,515
They are true.
I would not make empty statements.

317
00:49:09,341 --> 00:49:14,384
At first she was silent, but now she speaks
about "empty statements". Did she swallow a dictionary?

318
00:49:14,933 --> 00:49:16,859
What is the area of ??this territory?

319
00:49:16,979 --> 00:49:21,077
A few hundred square miles
terrain urban type, the conditions are not the best.

320
00:49:21,558 --> 00:49:24,539
But most likely this is the only way
Avoid Central Office.

321
00:49:24,659 --> 00:49:29,215
Yes, everything is under control there.
Vehicle Tracking System.

322
00:49:29,335 --> 00:49:32,459
Everything that moves is immediately displayed.
on their monitors.

323
00:49:32,579 --> 00:49:36,700
You need to avoid the surface,
have to go the other way.

324
00:49:37,044 --> 00:49:40,207
It will take more time.
But you will succeed.

325
00:50:05,597 --> 00:50:10,433
I hate to watch my soldiers
mistreat a woman. I hate it.

326
00:50:11,419 --> 00:50:15,946
But you got homemade bombs
and anti-government literature.

327
00:50:16,066 --> 00:50:19,202
Many of my soldiers are killed
such bombs.

328
00:50:19,322 --> 00:50:24,540
Tell me the name of your leader,
name of group, allies?

329
00:50:24,581 --> 00:50:27,691
And I promise
you will no longer be harmed.

330
00:50:29,873 --> 00:50:31,409
I can not hear you.

331
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,884
What? Tell me.

332
00:50:34,004 --> 00:50:39,616
- Power station...
- Power station?

333
00:50:41,999 --> 00:50:44,612
They won’t hurt you anymore.

334
00:50:51,145 --> 00:50:53,804
You have to understand
we did not always live as we are now.

335
00:50:54,194 --> 00:50:56,188
We just trusted the wrong people.

336
00:50:56,532 --> 00:50:59,994
Once we lived guided by
high principles and reasonable laws.

337
00:51:00,407 --> 00:51:02,699
But we got lost, like you.

338
00:51:03,180 --> 00:51:05,152
Now we have to
get back on track.

339
00:51:08,911 --> 00:51:13,656
This is our rulebook.
Formula, if that’s more clear to you.

340
00:51:14,069 --> 00:51:18,447
Once it worked
may help again.

341
00:51:40,351 --> 00:51:43,927
The Central Administration sent a detachment
to search for prisoners. Get ready!

342
00:51:44,047 --> 00:51:47,068
“We'll blow them.”
- You know what to do, we are moving forward!

343
00:51:47,572 --> 00:51:51,675
This is your chance, Willy.
You wanted to leave - leave, but on one condition ...

344
00:51:51,795 --> 00:51:54,781
- Take her to the Sabina base.
“That's what I planned.”

345
00:51:55,882 --> 00:51:57,303
Keep an eye on her, Willie.

346
00:51:57,991 --> 00:51:59,939
Okay, let's go, take you home.

347
00:52:03,285 --> 00:52:05,807
- Danny.
- Yeah.

348
00:52:06,564 --> 00:52:07,916
Be careful, man.

349
00:52:10,323 --> 00:52:11,561
Agreed.

350
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:13,629
Run, run.

351
00:52:16,074 --> 00:52:20,223
Squad "Rem" - go to exit number 3.
Danny, start the countdown.

352
00:52:22,827 --> 00:52:24,753
- This is for you.
- Thanks buddy.

353
00:52:24,881 --> 00:52:28,375
By the way, Gruber, you look,
do not use these things for nothing.

354
00:52:28,404 --> 00:52:33,303
Don’t worry, Danny, I was just about to
test the new model. Come on, my dear!

355
00:54:38,841 --> 00:54:41,977
- Try to catch me!
- Take him!

356
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:28,573
You lose the war, Quinn.

357
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:36,148
You are an interesting person, Brian.

358
00:56:37,523 --> 00:56:39,632
Your work is simple.

359
00:56:40,549 --> 00:56:44,538
They gave you a trace, and just follow it.

360
00:56:45.604 --> 00:56:47.713
Like a bloodhound.

361
00:56:47,833 --> 00:56:52,137
And arrest whoever you need
the state pays me for this.

362
00:56:52,916 --> 00:56:55,827
Track down and arrest.

363
00:56:56,767 --> 00:56:58,166
Or kill them.

364
00:56:59,174 --> 00:57:01,535
This is already starting to bother me.

365
00:57:03,658 --> 00:57:06,189
Maybe I was killing the wrong people?

366
00:57:08,802 --> 00:57:11,828
Or maybe I'm just getting
old and soft.

367
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:18,693
See you soon, boss.

368
00:58:01,052 --> 00:58:04,904
Listen to me. You have to run.
I'll find you later, okay?

369
00:58:05,024 --> 00:58:07,260
Go on. Come on. Come on!

370
00:59:33,791 --> 00:59:36,477
Not bad, not bad, not bad.

371
00:59:45.693 --> 00:59:47,805
So what the hell ...

372
00:59:48,247 --> 00:59:51,270
For the sake of all the saints
what is she doing here?

373
01:00:57,580 --> 01:00:59,570
The bull's eye!

374
01:01:01,693 --> 01:01:03,467
The bull's eye!

375
01:01:04,819 --> 01:01:07,279
You have not heard before
this song?

376
01:01:07,399 --> 01:01:10,453
No, I don’t know ... songs.

377
01:01:10,735 --> 01:01:16,452
This is normal, most people
not very musical.

378
01:01:16,483 --> 01:01:20,684
But partly it's sad
you know, now in our crazy world ...

379
01:01:20,685 --> 01:01:26,690
... there are not many good things left.
Good music, good booze, and of course ...

380
01:01:26,776 --> 01:01:28,549
...Good people.

381
01:01:28,661 --> 01:01:35,567
You know, when I met you, I thought
that you don’t understand anything at all in music.

382
01:01:35,695 --> 01:01:37,553
Do not consider it an insult.

383
01:01:37,984 --> 01:01:43,317
But you act so at ease
what you might think, you drank a little, but hardly.

384
01:01:43,437 --> 01:01:47,790
The men remain.
Is a man waiting for you somewhere?

385
01:01:47,910 --> 01:01:51,576
The man? Another kind?

386
01:01:51,698 --> 01:01:56,738
They called me differently, but this
not heard yet. But yes, yes. You could say that.

387
01:01:56,858 --> 01:02:01,756
- Do you have a man?
“Yes, but I left him there.”

388
01:02:02,386 --> 01:02:04,767
“Ah, he mistreated you, right?”
- Not.

389
01:02:04,887 --> 01:02:07,801
I like this man.
He helped me.

390
01:02:07,921 --> 01:02:12,225
Wait a moment. He helped you
you like him, why did you leave him?

391
01:02:12,279 --> 01:02:14,006
Such people need to stay close!

392
01:02:14,120 --> 01:02:19,047
He cannot return with me.
If he tries, he will die.

393
01:02:19,167 --> 01:02:22,890
“Well, so go with him.”
“Then I will die.”

394
01:02:26,532 --> 01:02:28,941
Here is this man!

395
01:02:41,587 --> 01:02:43,221
Wheelbarrow!

396
01:02:44,512 --> 01:02:47,574
- How are you?
- I'm fine, I made friends with this ...

397
01:02:47,614 --> 01:02:49,105
... male

398
01:02:49,188 --> 01:02:50,577
This is me, hi.

399
01:02:51,044 --> 01:02:57,045
Hey, you look familiar. You are one of
escaped prisoners or a bar visitor?

400
01:02:57,117 --> 01:02:59,008
Visitor, regular customer.

401
01:02:59,128 --> 01:03:02,771
Well then get in, I'll take
where do you need it.

402
01:03:02,837 --> 01:03:06,380
Maybe I'm something intelligible
I’ll hear from you. Come on, get in.

403
01:03:08,247 --> 01:03:11,316
By the way, what about your singing?

404
01:03:12,653 --> 01:03:14,194
Here is what I will tell you.

405
01:03:14,869 --> 01:03:17,952
Let's sing one jazz song now.

406
01:03:18,260 --> 01:03:24,192
Boogie-woogie style, and then bebop style.

407
01:04:29,439 --> 01:04:31,157
Let's see how I can help.

408
01:04:32,067 --> 01:04:32,948
Good luck

409
01:04:33,800 --> 01:04:37,441
This thing has been rubbing my nerves for a year now.
Hey, come, I will show you the house.

410
01:04:38,733 --> 01:04:42,185
I got a little mess here
you need to tidy up a bit.

411
01:04:42,303 --> 01:04:43,842
This is my backyard.

412
01:04:47.249 --> 01:04:49.275
Flower. I myself raised it in my garden.

413
01:04:49,752 --> 01:04:54,098
These are my pets, yeah.
Henrietta, Rosetta.

414
01:04:56,535 --> 01:04:57,959
And this is my garden.

415
01:04:58,079 --> 01:05:00,059
They are beautiful!

416
01:05:01,248 --> 01:05:03,972
- I would like to feed them!
- Feed?

417
01:05:04,092 --> 01:05:06,820
- What are you from another planet?
- Yes!

418
01:05:08,215 --> 01:05:11,871
That's what, I go down to the house and cook
some corn tortillas.

419
01:05:11,991 --> 01:05:16,232
- They are beautiful. Are they harmless?
“Yes, they will not bite.”

420
01:05:16,687 --> 01:05:17,803
Here's what, look.

421
01:05:19,608 --> 01:05:21,018
Hold it to you.

422
01:06:35,127 --> 01:06:36,508
How about you, huh?

423
01:06:49,010 --> 01:06:52,592
We have a problem with the truck,
one has to go check on how he is.

424
01:06:52,712 --> 01:06:57,849
But if you want, I have a drink in my house.
Yes, a drink, sir!

425
01:06:58,186 --> 01:07:01,748
Pour yourself a drink, huh?
Let's get out of here.

426
01:07:12,898 --> 01:07:13,852
Come on!

427
01:07:13,972 --> 01:07:16,554
What do we have here?

428
01:07:26,912 --> 01:07:28,395
Hey listen, listen.

429
01:07:28,645 --> 01:07:30,994
Here, here is what I have for you.

430
01:07:32,271 --> 01:07:33,974
Look, in fact - this is ...

431
01:07:34,094 --> 01:07:38,453
Money. There is a lot of money!
Many, you can take everything!

432
01:07:38,717 --> 01:07:39,583
Let's.

433
01:07:40,992 --> 01:07:43,209
Well, just look.

434
01:07:43,503 --> 01:07:45,456
Release me and the girl, okay?

435
01:07:45.576 --> 01:07:48.642
You're not quite in that position
to bargain!

436
01:07:50,418 --> 01:07:52,489
So I earned it.

437
01:07:53,208 --> 01:07:56,659
And what will my good friend wish
and partner?

438
01:08:02,076 --> 01:08:04,323
And, it seems he has already made a decision.

439
01:08:06,815 --> 01:08:08,959
Don’t touch the girl, okay?

440
01:08:12,380 --> 01:08:13,422
Of course...

441
01:09:22,092 --> 01:09:23,825
How glad I am to return.

442
01:09:27,955 --> 01:09:29,775
Here is my home ...

443
01:09:41,812 --> 01:09:43,970
Wait a minute. Do not run away.

444
01:09:45,086 --> 01:09:46,966
I'm a friend ... okay?

445
01:09:48.1999 --> 01:09:49.814
I am a friend.

446
01:09:51,605 --> 01:09:53,572
Do you understand this word?

447
01:09:54,835 --> 01:09:57,831
I know the meaning of this word.

448
01:09:58,814 --> 01:10:02,015
But it is not consistent
with your actions.

449
01:10:03,674 --> 01:10:05,642
They wanted to hurt me.

450
01:10:06,846 --> 01:10:08,666
I remember you.

451
01:10:09,342 --> 01:10:13,233
You were with a different tribe.
They also wanted to harm me.

452
01:10:13,541 --> 01:10:17,622
I know. And you are right.
But that was a mistake.

453
01:10:18,430 --> 01:10:20,148
They did not know who you were.

454
01:10:21,190 --> 01:10:23,129
I was just doing the work.

455
01:10:25,608 --> 01:10:29,925
“I think you want to take me prisoner again.”
“I will not come any closer.”

456
01:10:30,512 --> 01:10:32,245
I will not move from this place.

457
01:10:33,735 --> 01:10:35,702
Now we know who you are.

458
01:10:36,510 --> 01:10:39,035
“We want to help.”
- It is not true.

459
01:11:46.988 --> 01:11:48.031
Anyone take a chance?

460
01:11:49,861 --> 01:11:50,669
The gut is thin?

461
01:11:51,298 --> 01:11:52,575
Scum!

462
01:11:58,683 --> 01:11:59,803
Not!

463
01:12:08,704 --> 01:12:10,816
Who the hell are you!

464
01:12:19,312 --> 01:12:20,476
Your tribe ...

465
01:12:21,284 --> 01:12:24,636
“Your people have taken my freedom from me.”
- You're right.

466
01:12:25,389 --> 01:12:27,567
But they did not know who you are.

467
01:12:28,541 --> 01:12:32,037
They thought you were an enemy
like these people.

468
01:12:33,126 --> 01:12:34,415
These are bad people.

469
01:12:35,647 --> 01:12:38,370
They captured a man named Willy.

470
01:12:39,086 --> 01:12:42,668
And a man named Danny.
They are not bad people.

471
01:12:43,642 --> 01:12:44,961
He is dead.

472
01:12:46,021 --> 01:12:48,055
The one who helped you?

473
01:12:49,313 --> 01:12:50,631
I found him.

474
01:13:18,165 --> 01:13:20,091
But you no longer need to worry.

475
01:13:21,558 --> 01:13:24,561
I will help you. Believe me.

476
01:13:26,372 --> 01:13:28,114
I believed ...

477
01:13:28,527 --> 01:13:31,461
Not those ... people ...

478
01:13:40,768 --> 01:13:42,373
You can believe me.

479
01:14:41,847 --> 01:14:45,308
You already saw this place
why come back here?

480
01:14:45,428 --> 01:14:47,188
That is what I would like to find out.

481
01:14:47,991 --> 01:14:52,999
Who is waiting for you? Your comrades?
Man in white? Your leader

482
01:14:54,673 --> 01:14:56,644
Maybe he is your leader.

483
01:14:58,214 --> 01:15:01,974
In that case, we will meet
together. You...

484
01:15:02,661 --> 01:15:03,739
I...

485
01:15:04,461 --> 01:15:05,744
And Bryant.

486
01:17:22,863 --> 01:17:24,605
Hey, upstart!

487
01:19:03,509 --> 01:19:06,489
So, so, so what is here with us.

488
01:19:06,902 --> 01:19:09,434
- A person with many faces.
- Where is she?

489
01:19:09,554 --> 01:19:13,080
Forget about her.
It is written off.

490
01:19:13,446 --> 01:19:15,842
Her place in history.
Kaput. The end.

491
01:19:15,843 --> 01:19:20,140
Tell me what you want. Central
Management got to her.

492
01:19:22,111 --> 01:19:27,668
Interrogate her, find out everything,
and then put on the laboratory bench ...

493
01:19:27,689 --> 01:19:29,540
... and find out what it's made of.

494
01:19:30,387 --> 01:19:31,946
Do not do this, Willy.

495
01:19:32,999 --> 01:19:38,593
Stay where you are. Or die.
Do not make me do my job.

496
01:19:40,221 --> 01:19:41,459
Good...

497
01:20:00,450 --> 01:20:04,714
Look at me.
I know who you are.

498
01:20:06,663 --> 01:20:09,689
I know all about your friends.

499
01:20:10,262 --> 01:20:13,197
Your comrades ...

500
01:20:14,513 --> 01:20:15,980
About their plans.

501
01:20:21,391 --> 01:20:25,425
I said look at me!

502
01:20:46,454 --> 01:20:48,242
I do not wish you harm.

503
01:20:51,084 --> 01:20:53,147
I just need answers.

504
01:20:57,365 --> 01:20:59,383
Tell me who you are.

505
01:25:01,199 --> 01:25:03,004
Very dramatic.

506
01:25:05,125 --> 01:25:06,987
A man full of mysteries.

507
01:25:08,105 --> 01:25:10,369
A man without a past.

508
01:25:11,486 --> 01:25:13,320
And without a future.

509
01:25:18,307 --> 01:25:22,892
Let her go, Queen.
She will die if she stays here.

510
01:25:25,958 --> 01:25:27,248
Kill him.

511
01:26:19,110 --> 01:26:21,919
Let's not complicate
to each other's life.

512
01:26:22,039 --> 01:26:23,810
I need only a girl.

513
01:26:23,930 --> 01:26:28,080
I promise you they won’t send her
to the research lab.

514
01:26:29,111 --> 01:26:32,120
She’s more useful to me alive.

515
01:26:52,261 --> 01:26:55,675
Come on, faster! ..
