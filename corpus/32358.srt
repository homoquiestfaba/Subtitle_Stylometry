1
00:06:25,163 --> 00:06:30,533
At that time,
everybody was tall, thin and blond.

2
00:06:30,635 --> 00:06:35,504
Everybody posed,
everybody gave you a look.

3
00:06:35,573 --> 00:06:38,041
But Gia was different.

4
00:06:38,142 --> 00:06:42,135
She was the first one who--
who moved.

5
00:06:42,213 --> 00:06:45,512
They all try to do it now--
give you an attitude--

6
00:06:45,583 --> 00:06:48,017
but she invented it.

7
00:06:48,085 --> 00:06:50,553
She always followed her instincts...

8
00:06:50,655 --> 00:06:53,453
no matter
where they took her.

9
00:06:53,558 --> 00:06:58,188
lt was probably the best
and the worst thing about her.

10
00:06:58,262 --> 00:07:01,527
With Gia, it was always
about the sex--

11
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:04,500
every look, every move,
every minute.

12
00:07:05,436 --> 00:07:06,960
Every day.

13
00:07:09,207 --> 00:07:10,333
Sex.

14
00:07:10,441 --> 00:07:13,274
They were jealous of her.
They still are.

15
00:07:13,377 --> 00:07:15,368
That's why they say those things.

16
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:19,439
She would come on to everybody,
but it was really innocent.

17
00:07:19,550 --> 00:07:23,350
l mean, nobody was ever
really offended by it.

18
00:07:23,421 --> 00:07:26,857
l don't think it had anything
to do with sex.

19
00:07:27,091 --> 00:07:30,288
Even when she was sleeping around,
sex was not the goal.

20
00:07:30,394 --> 00:07:32,658
Sex wasn't really an issue.

21
00:07:32,997 --> 00:07:36,398
Yeah, l knew about the drugs.

22
00:07:36,501 --> 00:07:40,403
l was afraid of the drugs,
the way people used them.

23
00:07:40,505 --> 00:07:42,200
lt all just happened so fast.

24
00:07:42,273 --> 00:07:44,537
You know, all of a sudden,
her face was just everywhere.

25
00:07:44,642 --> 00:07:49,511
Every model has a moment--
l mean, the ones who make it at all.

26
00:07:49,614 --> 00:07:53,983
And being of the moment
is everything in fashion.

27
00:07:54,085 --> 00:07:59,216
Fashion is not art.
Fashion isn't even culture.

28
00:07:59,290 --> 00:08:01,383
Fashion is advertising...

29
00:08:01,459 --> 00:08:04,485
and advertising is money.

30
00:08:04,562 --> 00:08:09,499
And for every dollar you earn,
someone has to pay.

31
00:08:40,565 --> 00:08:44,296
Once upon a time,
once upon a time.

32
00:08:47,204 --> 00:08:49,468
lt was a fairy tale.

33
00:08:50,608 --> 00:08:53,509
lt was.
lt was a fairy tale come true.

34
00:08:56,514 --> 00:08:59,074
l had two boys, you know,
but boys you lose.

35
00:08:59,183 --> 00:09:03,176
They go away, they marry other women.
They're gone.

36
00:09:03,287 --> 00:09:06,313
A girl you have forever.

37
00:09:06,424 --> 00:09:09,655
When Gia was born,
l said, ''This one is mine.

38
00:09:10,027 --> 00:09:13,087
- Look at you.
- All mine.''

39
00:09:13,197 --> 00:09:15,256
Look at me.

40
00:09:15,333 --> 00:09:17,995
Look at us.

41
00:09:18,102 --> 00:09:21,339
Look how pretty we are.

42
00:09:21,339 --> 00:09:25,105
Do l be-- Do l be
the prettiest, prettiest girl?

43
00:09:25,176 --> 00:09:29,306
You do.
You do be the prettiest. You do.

44
00:09:34,185 --> 00:09:37,018
- Where the hell have you been?
- Out.

45
00:09:37,088 --> 00:09:41,184
- Out? Out? Out where?
- Out.

46
00:09:41,258 --> 00:09:42,555
Oh, Joe, don't start.

47
00:09:42,660 --> 00:09:45,529
Don't tell me, ''Don't start.''
Out where? Tell me where you've been.

48
00:09:45,529 --> 00:09:47,497
- Joe, lower your voice.
- Don't tell me to lower my voice.

49
00:09:47,565 --> 00:09:49,556
- The kids know you were out all night.
- Cut it out!

50
00:09:49,667 --> 00:09:52,363
- Tell them where you've been.
- l'm not in the mood for this tonight.

51
00:09:52,436 --> 00:09:55,030
Not in the mood, huh?

52
00:09:55,139 --> 00:09:57,266
- Just leave me alone.
- Who were you with Kathleen?

53
00:09:57,375 --> 00:10:00,173
- lt's none of your business.
- Don't tell me that, you fucking whore.

54
00:10:00,244 --> 00:10:03,509
- Get out of the kitchen.
- Let me see. Did he fuck you?

55
00:10:03,581 --> 00:10:06,141
- Where? Let me feel!
- Pig! Get your hands off!

56
00:10:06,250 --> 00:10:08,309
- Who else has been in there besides me?
- Get your hands off of me, jerk.

57
00:10:08,386 --> 00:10:10,354
- Who else, huh?
- You know how you make me feel?

58
00:10:10,454 --> 00:10:13,651
- You make me wanna die. You know that?
- You wanna die? No!

59
00:10:13,724 --> 00:10:16,591
You don't die until l tell you
you can die. Do you hear me?

60
00:10:16,694 --> 00:10:18,594
That's when you die!

61
00:10:30,574 --> 00:10:34,442
Here, take this and put it in the car.
l'll keep this one.

62
00:10:47,425 --> 00:10:49,086
Once upon a time...

63
00:10:50,327 --> 00:10:52,522
in a kingdom far, far away...

64
00:10:52,630 --> 00:10:54,621
there lived a young girl...

65
00:10:54,865 --> 00:10:56,833
whose hair was made of gold.

66
00:10:57,101 --> 00:11:00,400
When the people
in the village saw her, they said...

67
00:11:00,471 --> 00:11:03,201
''Oh, how beautiful she is.''

68
00:11:03,307 --> 00:11:06,538
One cheese steak, one meat ball,
one salami provolone.

69
00:11:06,644 --> 00:11:11,172
l'll be back by 4:00.
Try not to burn the place down.

70
00:11:11,282 --> 00:11:14,479
- Gia, you're in charge.
- All right, boss.

71
00:11:16,654 --> 00:11:19,589
Hey, get the food.
Go, come on, get outta here.

72
00:11:19,657 --> 00:11:22,251
- Get the cash register.
- l'm in charge!

73
00:11:24,528 --> 00:11:28,430
- ls your name Gia?
- Yeah.

74
00:11:31,168 --> 00:11:33,159
- Got a light?
- Stop screwing around.

75
00:11:33,270 --> 00:11:36,103
l've seen you a few times
around the neighborhood...

76
00:11:36,173 --> 00:11:38,107
- and--
- Are you nervous?

77
00:11:38,642 --> 00:11:40,803
Yeah.

78
00:11:40,911 --> 00:11:43,243
Am l making you nervous?

79
00:11:43,314 --> 00:11:44,576
Yeah.

80
00:11:47,651 --> 00:11:50,586
Well, good,
'cause that's the idea.

81
00:11:52,156 --> 00:11:54,556
- What's that?
- You scare the shit out of people...

82
00:11:54,658 --> 00:11:57,593
and then they don't see
how scared you are.

83
00:11:59,663 --> 00:12:01,130
Are you scared?

84
00:12:04,568 --> 00:12:07,264
What's your name?

85
00:12:07,338 --> 00:12:09,863
T.J. Tom Junior...

86
00:12:09,974 --> 00:12:11,874
but T.J. is what they call me.

87
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,580
T.J. and Gia.

88
00:12:20,518 --> 00:12:22,247
l like that. Come on.

89
00:12:22,319 --> 00:12:25,186
- l'm leaving.
- Wait a minute. Where you going?

90
00:12:25,289 --> 00:12:27,519
l'm in charge, and l'm leaving.

91
00:12:32,229 --> 00:12:34,220
- ls that the Byrds?
- They're so cool.

92
00:12:34,331 --> 00:12:36,959
Oh, wow.
Ooh, rock my world.

93
00:12:38,202 --> 00:12:39,965
Seventy-five cents?

94
00:12:41,372 --> 00:12:45,604
lt's pretty. Pretty.
Very pretty.

95
00:12:45,676 --> 00:12:47,303
Hello, ladies.

96
00:12:47,411 --> 00:12:49,311
Can l have this?
Come on.

97
00:12:53,584 --> 00:12:56,985
- Tattoo? You getting a tattoo now?
- Tattoos. Tattoo you.

98
00:12:57,254 --> 00:12:59,313
No, tattoo you.

99
00:12:59,423 --> 00:13:02,915
- l'm not getting a tattoo.
- Oh, come on. What?

100
00:13:03,027 --> 00:13:04,961
Look at that hair.
lt's fabulous.

101
00:13:11,268 --> 00:13:12,997
You want a tattoo now?

102
00:13:15,239 --> 00:13:17,469
She'd be a lot of fun.

103
00:13:21,879 --> 00:13:24,871
Who are you looking at,
him or me?

104
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:04,973
Oh, l can't talk about the sex.

105
00:15:05,082 --> 00:15:08,609
l mean, how would l know?

106
00:15:08,686 --> 00:15:13,055
lf you ask me,
she never really had sex with anybody.

107
00:15:15,559 --> 00:15:17,527
But she did love to be photographed...

108
00:15:17,594 --> 00:15:20,927
and people loved to take pictures of her
and do little things for her.

109
00:15:21,031 --> 00:15:23,864
She hated being photographed.

110
00:15:23,968 --> 00:15:28,462
You had to run after her
and tie her down.

111
00:15:28,572 --> 00:15:33,475
Then you had to get past the clothes
and the stuff in her hair.

112
00:15:34,578 --> 00:15:36,341
But she was special.

113
00:16:07,478 --> 00:16:10,072
Let's go.

114
00:16:10,180 --> 00:16:12,114
Coming, coming.

115
00:16:16,653 --> 00:16:18,416
All right, let's go.

116
00:16:31,702 --> 00:16:34,569
And they showed her
a beautiful house...

117
00:16:34,671 --> 00:16:37,469
on the planet Mars.

118
00:16:37,541 --> 00:16:40,942
And they said,
''Come and live here forever.''

119
00:16:41,045 --> 00:16:43,513
And the young girl said...

120
00:16:43,580 --> 00:16:47,072
''Oh, Mars is a planet
where life's different--

121
00:16:47,184 --> 00:16:50,119
safe, clean and pretty.''

122
00:16:52,156 --> 00:16:55,182
But-- But how do you get there?

123
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:59,225
Where do you find a taxi?
Which bus do you take?

124
00:16:59,496 --> 00:17:04,058
Right? And how do you know
you're there when you're there?

125
00:17:04,168 --> 00:17:07,660
Philadelphia was not ready for this.

126
00:17:09,273 --> 00:17:11,002
But New York was.

127
00:17:17,581 --> 00:17:19,071
lt was the right moment...

128
00:17:19,183 --> 00:17:23,677
and being of the moment
is everything in fashion.

129
00:17:23,787 --> 00:17:27,689
But of course,
the more you were of the moment...

130
00:17:27,758 --> 00:17:30,158
the faster you become
of the past.

131
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,936
Okay, let's get this over with.

132
00:17:38,936 --> 00:17:42,201
Just go in there
and try to be nice.

133
00:17:42,272 --> 00:17:45,036
- Nice? Nice.
- Yeah.

134
00:17:45,109 --> 00:17:48,272
Who knows?
Maybe they'll like you.

135
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:52,276
- You are a very likable girl.
- Fuck you.

136
00:18:00,057 --> 00:18:01,490
Hi.

137
00:18:04,595 --> 00:18:06,529
l'm here to see Wilhelmina Cooper.

138
00:18:06,630 --> 00:18:11,158
So's the rest of the world and the rest
of the world's way ahead of you, honey.

139
00:18:11,268 --> 00:18:12,701
Take a seat.

140
00:18:14,004 --> 00:18:15,028
l have an appointment.

141
00:18:16,974 --> 00:18:18,236
Hold, please.

142
00:18:19,676 --> 00:18:20,938
Of course you do.

143
00:18:21,044 --> 00:18:24,502
11:00, Gia Marie Carangi.

144
00:18:24,615 --> 00:18:26,105
G what?

145
00:18:28,318 --> 00:18:30,081
Okay.

146
00:18:39,930 --> 00:18:43,559
There. Gia.
Just fuck the rest of it. Call me Gia.

147
00:18:43,667 --> 00:18:46,636
Do you think you can remember that,
honey?

148
00:18:46,703 --> 00:18:50,104
Yeah? Cool.
Now tell the bitch l'm here.

149
00:18:57,314 --> 00:19:00,909
l've already seen the pictures, darling.
Maurice sent them.

150
00:19:01,018 --> 00:19:02,952
l wanted to see the real thing.

151
00:19:03,020 --> 00:19:04,578
Well, this is it.

152
00:19:04,688 --> 00:19:07,350
lt certainly is.

153
00:19:07,624 --> 00:19:10,718
You practically gave
my receptionist a coronary.

154
00:19:11,995 --> 00:19:14,088
Yeah, well, look.

155
00:19:14,198 --> 00:19:16,564
This was a free trip to New York...

156
00:19:16,667 --> 00:19:19,261
and if l knew you were looking
for Marcia-fucking-Brady...

157
00:19:19,336 --> 00:19:20,633
l would've stayed home.

158
00:19:20,737 --> 00:19:24,002
How do you know
what l'm looking for?

159
00:19:30,113 --> 00:19:34,174
- Look at me.
- l'm looking, l'm looking.

160
00:19:34,284 --> 00:19:37,583
You know, dressing like
a motorcycle tramp...

161
00:19:37,688 --> 00:19:41,715
is somewhat interesting
for a 17-year-old girl.

162
00:19:41,959 --> 00:19:44,325
Talking like one is not.

163
00:19:44,394 --> 00:19:48,956
ln fact, talking at all is not really
required in this profession...

164
00:19:49,032 --> 00:19:51,296
or even encouraged.

165
00:19:51,368 --> 00:19:54,303
Anything you might have to say
you say through the camera...

166
00:19:54,371 --> 00:19:56,168
the image, huh...

167
00:19:56,240 --> 00:19:58,708
and hopefully the product.

168
00:19:58,942 --> 00:20:02,673
What comes out of your mouth
is totally irrelevant.

169
00:20:02,779 --> 00:20:04,007
Understood?

170
00:20:04,982 --> 00:20:06,210
Yes, sir.

171
00:20:07,317 --> 00:20:11,048
Now, this is a career.

172
00:20:11,154 --> 00:20:13,315
This is a future.

173
00:20:13,423 --> 00:20:15,357
This is a life...

174
00:20:16,760 --> 00:20:18,022
if you want it.

175
00:20:18,128 --> 00:20:20,153
Does that mean
you can get me a job?

176
00:20:24,101 --> 00:20:26,403
l get you the interviews.

177
00:20:26,403 --> 00:20:28,371
You get the job.

178
00:20:33,243 --> 00:20:36,906
And l believe you will.

179
00:20:36,980 --> 00:20:39,448
Dear Diary, this is my life.

180
00:20:39,716 --> 00:20:43,049
Go see Young & Rubicom, 9:45.

181
00:20:43,153 --> 00:20:46,179
Go see people at Revlon, 11:15.

182
00:20:46,290 --> 00:20:50,454
Go see Demi Moore, Bob Stone,
Somebody Malowinksi...

183
00:20:50,727 --> 00:20:54,424
and ''Get lost, honey.
You ain't what we're lookin' for.''

184
00:20:54,498 --> 00:20:58,434
- Next!
- Thank you and fuck you. Bye.

185
00:20:58,502 --> 00:21:02,905
Yeah, l go see, l go see.
Nobody sees me.

186
00:21:02,973 --> 00:21:06,704
''Ah, piece of meat, come here.
Show me your bag.''

187
00:21:06,943 --> 00:21:09,070
And they stick their finger in you.

188
00:21:09,179 --> 00:21:11,374
''l just wanna taste your temperature.''

189
00:21:12,449 --> 00:21:15,714
Go see, go see, go see,
go see somebody else.

190
00:21:15,952 --> 00:21:18,978
l ain't no good at this.
l ain't no good at this at all.

191
00:21:19,089 --> 00:21:23,719
But even if you are good at it,
what, exactly, are you good at?

192
00:21:25,729 --> 00:21:28,721
- You can't leave now.
- l have to go.

193
00:21:28,965 --> 00:21:31,763
What, what?
To Philadelphia?

194
00:21:31,968 --> 00:21:35,404
- For what?
- l got stuff.

195
00:21:35,505 --> 00:21:37,439
l have to go.

196
00:21:37,507 --> 00:21:42,410
Well, somebody has to take care of me.
l'm just a kid.

197
00:21:42,479 --> 00:21:44,413
Bullshit.

198
00:21:52,022 --> 00:21:54,957
What's in Philadelphia
that's more important than me?

199
00:21:57,294 --> 00:21:59,728
- Do not do that.
- Do not do what?

200
00:22:01,264 --> 00:22:04,461
Do not pretend you're gonna do something
when you know you're not.

201
00:22:04,534 --> 00:22:06,468
What am l not gonna do?

202
00:22:21,184 --> 00:22:22,446
What else?

203
00:22:40,504 --> 00:22:42,096
What?

204
00:22:54,484 --> 00:22:56,452
- Know what l want?
- What?

205
00:23:06,196 --> 00:23:07,458
What?

206
00:23:21,211 --> 00:23:23,202
How do they fit?

207
00:23:35,459 --> 00:23:37,256
This turn you on?

208
00:23:39,296 --> 00:23:40,888
Yeah.

209
00:23:40,997 --> 00:23:42,487
- Kinda.
- All right.

210
00:23:42,566 --> 00:23:44,261
Come here.

211
00:23:53,510 --> 00:23:57,207
- Have you ever had sex with a man?
- Yeah.

212
00:23:58,315 --> 00:23:59,577
Once.

213
00:24:00,317 --> 00:24:02,376
And?

214
00:24:02,452 --> 00:24:06,388
And l could've done that
with a German shepherd.

215
00:24:14,130 --> 00:24:17,190
Dear Book, this is
another day in the life.

216
00:24:17,267 --> 00:24:19,997
A life is like a book.
A book is like a box.

217
00:24:20,103 --> 00:24:23,402
A box has six sides,
inside and outside.

218
00:24:23,473 --> 00:24:27,307
So how do you get
to what's inside?

219
00:24:27,410 --> 00:24:29,605
How do you get
what's inside out?

220
00:24:30,013 --> 00:24:32,038
Once upon a time,
there was a very pretty girl...

221
00:24:32,148 --> 00:24:35,345
who lived in a beautiful box
and everybody loved her.

222
00:24:43,426 --> 00:24:45,986
- Yes, hello?
- Hello?

223
00:24:46,062 --> 00:24:48,997
- What?
- Who the hell is that?

224
00:24:49,099 --> 00:24:51,397
- Wili?
- Who is it?

225
00:24:51,468 --> 00:24:53,436
- Christ's sake.
- l couldn't sleep.

226
00:24:55,205 --> 00:24:57,935
- Middle of the night.
- lt's very late.

227
00:24:58,041 --> 00:25:00,339
- l know.
- Goddamn it.

228
00:25:00,443 --> 00:25:01,933
ls that your husband?

229
00:25:02,012 --> 00:25:05,573
- Yes.
- ls he pissed?

230
00:25:05,982 --> 00:25:07,176
Yes.

231
00:25:07,284 --> 00:25:11,186
ls it true that he drinks?
That's what everybody says.

232
00:25:11,288 --> 00:25:15,224
And he gets violent?

233
00:25:15,325 --> 00:25:17,259
What is it you want, Gia?

234
00:25:17,327 --> 00:25:20,160
lf he ever lays a hand on you,
l'll fuckin' kill him.

235
00:25:25,201 --> 00:25:26,566
Why can't you sleep?

236
00:25:28,438 --> 00:25:29,996
Do you want me to come over?

237
00:25:30,106 --> 00:25:32,597
You're nervous about tomorrow.

238
00:25:40,216 --> 00:25:41,581
Yeah, l am.

239
00:25:42,018 --> 00:25:44,509
Well, everyone is nervous
on their first shoot.

240
00:25:44,621 --> 00:25:47,021
You'll be fine.

241
00:25:47,090 --> 00:25:50,287
Yeah, l just don't know what to do.
You know?

242
00:25:50,393 --> 00:25:52,327
Did you do your colonic?

243
00:25:52,429 --> 00:25:54,363
Yeah.

244
00:25:55,198 --> 00:25:56,358
Good.

245
00:25:56,433 --> 00:26:01,234
Go to bed now.
Take one half...

246
00:26:01,338 --> 00:26:03,568
of the Nembutal--
the yellow and black.

247
00:26:06,209 --> 00:26:07,608
You'll be fine.

248
00:26:08,578 --> 00:26:13,481
- Just be yourself.
- Okay, yeah.

249
00:26:13,550 --> 00:26:15,484
What is that?

250
00:26:17,387 --> 00:26:20,220
Oh, darling...

251
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:25,626
if l could answer that for you
or for me...

252
00:26:25,695 --> 00:26:31,565
well, life on this planet
would be a very different proposition.

253
00:26:40,610 --> 00:26:42,271
So l tell her, ''Look...

254
00:26:42,379 --> 00:26:44,438
l know Calvin...

255
00:26:44,547 --> 00:26:46,538
and l asked him about you...

256
00:26:46,616 --> 00:26:48,243
and he didn't know who you were.''

257
00:26:48,351 --> 00:26:50,615
- She's such a liar.
- Oh, man.

258
00:27:42,105 --> 00:27:44,801
Excuse me, can l help you?

259
00:27:44,874 --> 00:27:49,311
Yeah, yeah.
Could l have some more coffee, please?

260
00:27:49,379 --> 00:27:52,405
- Are you Gia?
- That's me.

261
00:27:52,515 --> 00:27:55,507
You're late.
Go wash your face.

262
00:27:55,618 --> 00:27:59,247
l already did.
lt's nice to meet you too.

263
00:28:02,459 --> 00:28:04,859
What the hell
am l gonna do with you?

264
00:28:06,563 --> 00:28:08,087
l got it.

265
00:28:09,265 --> 00:28:13,167
l don't know.
l'm just some dumb girl from Philly.

266
00:28:14,504 --> 00:28:16,563
Oh, my God, she's a beast.

267
00:28:16,639 --> 00:28:19,199
She scares me.

268
00:28:19,309 --> 00:28:21,504
Oh, Phillipe, does she remind you
of your mother?

269
00:28:21,611 --> 00:28:23,579
No, she reminds me
of my brother.

270
00:28:23,680 --> 00:28:26,240
He's in jail now, thank Jesus.

271
00:28:28,418 --> 00:28:29,680
Okay.

272
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:40,918
What?

273
00:28:43,399 --> 00:28:44,388
lt's wonderful.

274
00:28:45,835 --> 00:28:47,598
Let's see this face.

275
00:28:52,175 --> 00:28:54,234
l'm checking to see
if you need to be tweezed.

276
00:28:54,344 --> 00:28:56,608
- l'm tweezed.
- l'm Linda.

277
00:28:58,214 --> 00:28:59,579
Nice to meet you.

278
00:29:00,917 --> 00:29:02,350
Dreadful.

279
00:29:04,420 --> 00:29:05,944
Absolutely horrendous.

280
00:29:08,224 --> 00:29:09,486
More teeth.

281
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:14,155
Every photograph makes a promise,
and the promise is never kept.

282
00:29:14,264 --> 00:29:16,164
Look brain damaged.

283
00:29:16,266 --> 00:29:18,166
That's what makes a photo great.

284
00:29:19,502 --> 00:29:22,198
And if the promise is sex...

285
00:29:25,308 --> 00:29:28,675
- then you really have something.
- Good.

286
00:29:28,912 --> 00:29:30,345
Wonderful.

287
00:29:31,514 --> 00:29:32,879
Well...

288
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:35,313
that was all shit.

289
00:29:35,385 --> 00:29:37,444
- Fuck you.
- Now we can pay our rent.

290
00:29:37,520 --> 00:29:39,954
Who wants to stay
and make some art?

291
00:29:40,223 --> 00:29:42,316
What's art?

292
00:29:42,425 --> 00:29:45,861
Keep the fence,
lose the clothes.

293
00:29:45,962 --> 00:29:47,862
No, thanks, l'm gone.

294
00:29:47,964 --> 00:29:50,524
l'm outta here.
See you.

295
00:29:56,606 --> 00:29:58,403
l'll stay if Linda stays.

296
00:30:32,542 --> 00:30:34,874
- Linda, liebling?
- Yeah.

297
00:30:37,614 --> 00:30:39,275
Go stand by the fence.

298
00:30:39,349 --> 00:30:43,012
- You want me in the shot?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

299
00:30:43,086 --> 00:30:45,020
And lose the clothes.

300
00:32:17,146 --> 00:32:20,604
Sex-- Sex was really easy.
lt was.

301
00:32:20,683 --> 00:32:25,916
Sex was everywhere.
lt didn't really mean too much.

302
00:32:25,989 --> 00:32:29,550
Love was the hard thing to find.

303
00:32:29,659 --> 00:32:34,596
Even if you were looking for it,
which not too many people were.

304
00:32:34,864 --> 00:32:38,493
Even if you found it...

305
00:32:38,568 --> 00:32:40,502
which not too many people did...

306
00:32:40,570 --> 00:32:45,564
even if it was right there
in front of you...

307
00:32:45,675 --> 00:32:50,442
how could you see it
with all this sex in the way?

308
00:33:28,117 --> 00:33:32,144
Hey, where you going?

309
00:33:33,222 --> 00:33:36,055
What happened?
What's the matter?

310
00:33:36,159 --> 00:33:38,593
You don't have any clothes on.

311
00:33:41,097 --> 00:33:42,894
Don't change the subject.

312
00:33:43,900 --> 00:33:46,528
l have a boyfriend.

313
00:33:46,636 --> 00:33:48,069
So?

314
00:33:48,171 --> 00:33:50,935
So, l have to go.

315
00:33:52,241 --> 00:33:54,573
l have to go, l have to go.
Everybody has to go.

316
00:33:54,677 --> 00:33:57,669
Where the fuck does everybody go
when they have to go?

317
00:33:59,015 --> 00:34:02,178
You-- You and l had a--

318
00:34:02,251 --> 00:34:05,220
l mean, it was--
l had a--

319
00:34:09,225 --> 00:34:12,626
l'm really very square.

320
00:34:13,729 --> 00:34:14,957
So am l.

321
00:34:15,064 --> 00:34:16,998
Yeah, l can see that.

322
00:34:20,036 --> 00:34:21,196
Please, don't go.

323
00:34:23,072 --> 00:34:26,940
Please, don't go.
Please, l'll make you breakfast.

324
00:34:28,744 --> 00:34:30,644
Come on.

325
00:34:35,151 --> 00:34:36,880
- Going down?
- No.

326
00:34:36,986 --> 00:34:38,886
- Yes.
- No!

327
00:34:38,955 --> 00:34:41,287
No, no.
What are you doing? No.

328
00:34:41,557 --> 00:34:44,185
- l'm so sorry, l'm so sorry.
- Linda!

329
00:34:45,094 --> 00:34:46,493
l'll call you.

330
00:34:53,102 --> 00:34:57,129
lt was like a puppy.

331
00:34:57,240 --> 00:35:00,539
Love me, love me, love me.

332
00:35:00,643 --> 00:35:02,110
l did.

333
00:35:03,246 --> 00:35:05,146
l did right away.

334
00:35:05,214 --> 00:35:08,615
Extraordinary,
as in phenomenal...

335
00:35:08,718 --> 00:35:11,152
as in a gold mine.

336
00:35:11,254 --> 00:35:16,089
Tough, vulnerable, old, young...

337
00:35:16,993 --> 00:35:19,086
decadent, innocent...

338
00:35:19,162 --> 00:35:21,096
male, female.

339
00:35:23,332 --> 00:35:25,892
You look like you don't give a shit.

340
00:35:30,239 --> 00:35:33,106
l met somebody,
someone l really like.

341
00:35:33,176 --> 00:35:36,111
Good. Good for you.

342
00:35:37,980 --> 00:35:40,915
Take a deep breath, darling.

343
00:35:41,017 --> 00:35:45,113
You are in for the ride
of your life.

344
00:36:01,704 --> 00:36:04,036
Paolo.

345
00:36:06,042 --> 00:36:09,569
Lower the fucking drawbridge.
Give me some of those drink tickets.

346
00:36:09,679 --> 00:36:13,615
Always a pleasure to see you too,
Stephie, and this must be Gia.

347
00:36:13,716 --> 00:36:15,911
How do you know my name?

348
00:36:16,018 --> 00:36:18,111
l'm god, l know everything.

349
00:36:18,221 --> 00:36:20,121
See, even god knows your name.

350
00:36:20,189 --> 00:36:22,987
With a face like that,
she doesn't need a name.

351
00:36:23,092 --> 00:36:26,926
Actually, Tony,
my face is a little higher.

352
00:36:29,365 --> 00:36:32,163
Anytime, Gia, anytime.

353
00:36:32,235 --> 00:36:34,328
Stop being stingy, Tony.

354
00:36:43,145 --> 00:36:45,613
That's something to be on--
downers and champagne.

355
00:36:45,715 --> 00:36:47,649
Very rich.

356
00:36:47,717 --> 00:36:49,708
Ooh, did him in a car once.

357
00:36:49,952 --> 00:36:52,682
l can't remember exactly
how fast we were going.

358
00:36:54,323 --> 00:36:58,089
That's Stan Girardi. Used to do it
with Cheryl, but he's doable.

359
00:36:58,194 --> 00:37:01,686
Ooh, Joe Jamison.
Beautiful, but gay.

360
00:37:01,931 --> 00:37:03,990
Not that that'd ever stop me.

361
00:37:07,069 --> 00:37:09,629
A little tongue up his ass...

362
00:37:09,705 --> 00:37:11,332
and he's all yours.

363
00:37:20,016 --> 00:37:21,643
You're full of shit, aren't you?

364
00:37:21,751 --> 00:37:25,653
Sometimes l don't believe it,
but it's all true.

365
00:37:25,755 --> 00:37:27,689
Okay, break it up.

366
00:37:29,225 --> 00:37:31,056
- On your left.
- Who was that?

367
00:37:31,160 --> 00:37:32,422
l have no idea.

368
00:37:41,304 --> 00:37:45,866
l do be the prettiest, prettiest girl.
l do be that.

369
00:37:57,787 --> 00:38:02,315
No, she's new, brand-new.
You have to see her. You'll like her.

370
00:38:12,968 --> 00:38:15,198
- She's on the cover.
- Gia, yeah.

371
00:38:15,304 --> 00:38:18,068
No last name.
Just Gia.

372
00:38:48,237 --> 00:38:49,226
Boring.

373
00:38:50,373 --> 00:38:52,432
Played out.

374
00:38:52,541 --> 00:38:54,099
Fat.

375
00:38:56,278 --> 00:38:57,540
Boring.

376
00:38:59,014 --> 00:39:00,276
Too dumb.

377
00:39:00,349 --> 00:39:03,341
For winter, we need meat.

378
00:39:03,452 --> 00:39:06,021
We need someone
with blood in her veins.

379
00:39:06,021 --> 00:39:08,546
Not just suntan oil
and mineral water.

380
00:39:10,359 --> 00:39:14,352
Oh, God, l am so sick of her face.

381
00:39:19,268 --> 00:39:23,534
- Who's this?
- One of Wilhelmina's new girls, Gia.

382
00:39:32,448 --> 00:39:34,939
This is meat.

383
00:39:35,017 --> 00:39:38,919
This is sirloin.
lt's lusty.

384
00:39:39,021 --> 00:39:43,321
Winter is carnivorous--
rich browns, reds, big animal prints.

385
00:39:43,426 --> 00:39:45,326
This is it. Yes!

386
00:40:00,109 --> 00:40:02,339
l just bought it.
What do you think?

387
00:40:02,411 --> 00:40:04,345
- Wow.
- ''Wow''?

388
00:40:07,349 --> 00:40:09,283
Wanna go for a ride?

389
00:40:09,385 --> 00:40:12,946
- l don't know.
- Oh, oh, yeah, you do. Come on.

390
00:40:19,328 --> 00:40:20,590
Yes!

391
00:40:24,266 --> 00:40:26,461
- Where we going? What?
- Philadelphia.

392
00:40:29,438 --> 00:40:32,566
- Hold on!
- l am!

393
00:40:35,211 --> 00:40:36,200
Yeah?

394
00:40:38,013 --> 00:40:40,208
Hi, Kathleen.

395
00:40:42,351 --> 00:40:44,285
My God.

396
00:40:46,388 --> 00:40:49,949
Oh, my God!
Come on in.

397
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:53,451
- Come on.
- This is my girlfriend, Linda.

398
00:40:53,562 --> 00:40:58,397
Linda? Yeah, hi.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

399
00:40:58,467 --> 00:41:00,162
So, tell me about New York.

400
00:41:00,236 --> 00:41:03,137
Oh, God, it was like seeing
an old girlfriend.

401
00:41:03,239 --> 00:41:06,367
Oh, yeah, she told me all the gossip
about all the models.

402
00:41:06,442 --> 00:41:11,402
You know, who had bad skin
and who had bad hair.

403
00:41:11,514 --> 00:41:13,539
The things that they did,
she told me about.

404
00:41:13,949 --> 00:41:16,349
And the places that they went--
Oh, my God.

405
00:41:18,254 --> 00:41:20,347
Oh, my God!

406
00:41:20,456 --> 00:41:23,391
You're on the cover of Vogue!
l can't believe it.

407
00:41:24,627 --> 00:41:28,427
Oh, my God, isn't that beautiful?

408
00:41:28,531 --> 00:41:30,965
Oh, honey.

409
00:41:31,066 --> 00:41:35,162
So what else is going on, huh?
Do you have a boyfriend?

410
00:41:35,237 --> 00:41:38,206
Uh, no.
Linda has a boyfriend.

411
00:41:38,307 --> 00:41:41,174
Oh, yeah?
Well, that's nice.

412
00:41:42,545 --> 00:41:46,504
- l have a girlfriend.
- Oh, yeah, that's nice too...

413
00:41:46,615 --> 00:41:49,243
though it's not
the same thing, is it?

414
00:41:49,351 --> 00:41:52,980
And we never talked about the past.
That was over.

415
00:41:53,088 --> 00:41:57,422
The past was the past.
She never discussed it with me once.

416
00:41:57,493 --> 00:42:01,429
lt was like it never happened--
all those years in between.

417
00:42:03,132 --> 00:42:05,066
lt was like it never happened.

418
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:08,432
l kept everything you've sent me.

419
00:42:08,537 --> 00:42:11,131
l keep everything
you ever touched...

420
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:13,105
ever since you were a baby.

421
00:42:13,175 --> 00:42:16,110
What do l have?
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

422
00:42:16,178 --> 00:42:18,112
My journal.

423
00:42:22,251 --> 00:42:25,152
Once upon a time--

424
00:42:26,989 --> 00:42:30,425
''Once upon a time,
there was a girl with golden hair...

425
00:42:30,526 --> 00:42:34,724
who went to live
in a beautiful house.''

426
00:42:34,997 --> 00:42:37,192
Always the same story.

427
00:42:37,299 --> 00:42:41,133
Always different,
always the same.

428
00:42:41,203 --> 00:42:43,228
Always the same.

429
00:42:49,044 --> 00:42:50,102
Can l see?

430
00:42:51,547 --> 00:42:53,105
Yeah.

431
00:42:59,188 --> 00:43:02,385
Sometimes l think she was
a different person to everybody.

432
00:43:04,393 --> 00:43:06,418
Sometimes l knew who she was.

433
00:43:07,529 --> 00:43:10,327
Sometimes l didn't.

434
00:43:10,399 --> 00:43:14,802
Anybody who tries to tell you
exactly who she was...

435
00:43:15,070 --> 00:43:16,435
they didn't know her at all.

436
00:43:19,141 --> 00:43:22,577
We did everything together.
Yeah, in those days.

437
00:43:22,811 --> 00:43:24,574
Yeah, everything.

438
00:43:30,052 --> 00:43:31,349
All right.

439
00:43:36,592 --> 00:43:38,150
This is--

440
00:43:40,262 --> 00:43:43,095
What can l say?
lt's you.

441
00:43:43,198 --> 00:43:44,563
l found it on short notice.

442
00:43:47,269 --> 00:43:49,533
That's what it looks like.

443
00:43:50,806 --> 00:43:53,331
So, l was standing
in the middle of the living room...

444
00:43:53,409 --> 00:43:55,843
and the bathroom door opens.

445
00:43:58,814 --> 00:44:00,475
- Yeah?
- Who's that?

446
00:44:00,582 --> 00:44:02,106
Who?

447
00:44:07,289 --> 00:44:10,156
l started making trips
to New York regularly after that.

448
00:44:10,225 --> 00:44:13,126
She wanted me there.
She wanted me there all the time.

449
00:44:13,228 --> 00:44:15,822
l couldn't because l had a husband,
l had a home.

450
00:44:16,098 --> 00:44:19,829
No, not red.
Yellow. Yellow roses.

451
00:44:20,102 --> 00:44:23,333
But l would go,
and l would stay for maybe a week.

452
00:44:23,439 --> 00:44:25,373
Sometimes l would stay two.

453
00:44:25,441 --> 00:44:27,841
Love on ya, Gia.

454
00:44:31,146 --> 00:44:34,206
You're sending flowers to a girl?

455
00:44:35,451 --> 00:44:38,215
- Here, lady.
- Hi. Got it. Thanks.

456
00:44:47,796 --> 00:44:50,424
Christ, another one?

457
00:44:50,532 --> 00:44:54,127
- Who died?
- None of your business.

458
00:44:57,539 --> 00:45:00,372
Are you fucking a florist
behind my back?

459
00:45:00,442 --> 00:45:04,378
Yeah. Gold FTD guy
with the winged shoes.

460
00:45:12,187 --> 00:45:13,415
Hi.

461
00:45:17,326 --> 00:45:19,123
l've been calling you for weeks.

462
00:45:19,228 --> 00:45:20,593
Hi, Gia.

463
00:45:23,298 --> 00:45:28,133
- This is my boyfriend, Billy.
- Hi. l'm wrecked.

464
00:45:31,673 --> 00:45:34,836
- Do you wanna come in?
- l don't think that's a good idea.

465
00:45:34,943 --> 00:45:37,537
Why not?

466
00:45:37,613 --> 00:45:40,582
You are really beautiful.

467
00:45:40,849 --> 00:45:42,942
You're a model, aren't you?

468
00:45:43,185 --> 00:45:45,210
Why? Do l look stupid?

469
00:45:47,356 --> 00:45:50,484
- l have to work tomorrow.
- Come on, it's early.

470
00:45:50,592 --> 00:45:54,528
Maybe-- Maybe we could party.

471
00:46:03,505 --> 00:46:06,303
You are the most beautiful woman
l have ever seen.

472
00:46:06,408 --> 00:46:08,205
Come with me.

473
00:46:08,310 --> 00:46:09,572
l can't.

474
00:46:21,557 --> 00:46:22,819
See you around.

475
00:46:30,365 --> 00:46:32,299
What the fuck was that?

476
00:46:33,936 --> 00:46:35,836
Behold the florist.

477
00:47:20,582 --> 00:47:22,516
l cannot stay!

478
00:47:23,652 --> 00:47:27,383
l'll come back,
but l have to go home now.

479
00:47:27,489 --> 00:47:29,286
l'll come back.

480
00:47:33,862 --> 00:47:35,921
lf you need me, you just call me.

481
00:47:36,031 --> 00:47:38,522
l need you.
l need you now.

482
00:47:38,600 --> 00:47:40,898
You have to be here now!

483
00:47:40,969 --> 00:47:45,406
When l need you, l need you! Now!
l need you, Mom!

484
00:47:45,507 --> 00:47:50,467
Listen to me.
You are a big girl, all right?

485
00:47:52,347 --> 00:47:55,646
- Please! Please!
- Act like a big girl.

486
00:47:55,884 --> 00:47:59,342
You've got to.
And you are.

487
00:48:01,056 --> 00:48:03,524
So be my big girl.

488
00:48:05,961 --> 00:48:07,394
Now listen to me.

489
00:48:11,700 --> 00:48:14,897
l have to go home.

490
00:48:15,003 --> 00:48:16,493
l have to.

491
00:48:16,605 --> 00:48:18,664
Fine. Fine!

492
00:48:20,509 --> 00:48:22,500
- Get out!
- All right, now wait.

493
00:48:22,611 --> 00:48:25,944
- Get the fuck out!
- No, not like this.

494
00:48:26,048 --> 00:48:28,516
Yeah, like this! Get out!
There. Get the fuck out!

495
00:48:28,617 --> 00:48:30,585
- For God's sake.
- Get out!

496
00:48:30,686 --> 00:48:33,052
- Not like this, not like this.
- Yeah, like this. Get the fuck out!

497
00:48:33,155 --> 00:48:35,385
- Look.
- There, get out!

498
00:48:35,490 --> 00:48:38,584
- All right. Fine, fine, fine. Fine.
- Go, go!

499
00:48:38,660 --> 00:48:41,493
- All right, fine.
- Get out!

500
00:48:44,666 --> 00:48:46,065
That's it.

501
00:48:47,169 --> 00:48:48,602
That--

502
00:49:13,528 --> 00:49:17,487
She's booked for 16 shoots this week,
but l'll see what we can do.

503
00:49:17,599 --> 00:49:19,066
And you are erupting forms...

504
00:49:19,167 --> 00:49:20,395
Tell Scavullo he can have her--

505
00:49:20,502 --> 00:49:23,437
out of the center
of all this tired, old beauty.

506
00:49:23,538 --> 00:49:25,130
Shaming them.

507
00:49:25,207 --> 00:49:28,472
Excuse me?
Tired, old beauty?

508
00:49:28,577 --> 00:49:33,480
You can have Renee. l know you want Gia,
but you can't have Gia. Not until June.

509
00:49:33,548 --> 00:49:36,949
This little wop is not standing
in front of me. You got that?

510
00:49:37,052 --> 00:49:39,077
l'm off to the side, or l walk.

511
00:49:39,187 --> 00:49:41,587
Yeah, me too.

512
00:49:41,690 --> 00:49:43,055
Does this dress
make my ass look fat?

513
00:49:43,158 --> 00:49:45,626
Your ass is fat, honey.

514
00:49:45,694 --> 00:49:48,629
And l'm not standing
next to her fat ass.

515
00:49:53,135 --> 00:49:54,534
l know.

516
00:49:58,173 --> 00:50:01,142
Life is so disappointing.

517
00:50:01,243 --> 00:50:03,541
Here you are.

518
00:50:03,645 --> 00:50:05,636
You have arrived.

519
00:50:05,881 --> 00:50:09,647
You are here.
This is your moment.

520
00:50:11,720 --> 00:50:14,086
What do you have?

521
00:50:14,189 --> 00:50:16,123
You have pain.

522
00:50:19,628 --> 00:50:22,426
When you have everything...

523
00:50:22,531 --> 00:50:24,931
what do you have?

524
00:50:25,033 --> 00:50:27,903
You have nothing.

525
00:50:27,903 --> 00:50:31,839
When everything is right,
everything is wrong.

526
00:50:32,941 --> 00:50:36,206
lt's disappointing.
lt's confusing.

527
00:50:36,278 --> 00:50:39,839
This is life.
What can you do?

528
00:50:42,517 --> 00:50:45,111
People keep going away from me.
That hurts.

529
00:50:48,957 --> 00:50:50,219
Work.

530
00:50:50,292 --> 00:50:52,886
Work.
You have a gift.

531
00:50:52,994 --> 00:50:54,621
Use it.

532
00:50:54,696 --> 00:50:57,824
Life will be there later.

533
00:50:57,933 --> 00:51:01,630
When you've worked
and you've lived...

534
00:51:03,138 --> 00:51:05,572
and you know who you are,
life is easy.

535
00:51:07,309 --> 00:51:09,539
Work.

536
00:51:09,611 --> 00:51:12,045
lt's the only answer l know.

537
00:51:13,515 --> 00:51:15,278
l should've been a rock star.

538
00:51:17,285 --> 00:51:19,219
But l can't sing.

539
00:51:23,258 --> 00:51:25,055
Work now.

540
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:27,094
You can live later.

541
00:51:29,698 --> 00:51:32,098
You'd say anything
to get that shot.

542
00:51:32,968 --> 00:51:34,970
- Yes.
- Yes.

543
00:51:34,970 --> 00:51:37,939
ln this case,
l'm saying the truth.

544
00:51:40,876 --> 00:51:41,968
Sweetheart.

545
00:51:42,077 --> 00:51:45,308
Now here's the picture.
You girls all hate Gia...

546
00:51:45,580 --> 00:51:48,105
because she is so much prettier
than the rest of you.

547
00:51:48,216 --> 00:51:51,151
You're all so boring.

548
00:51:51,219 --> 00:51:53,813
She is so exciting.

549
00:51:53,922 --> 00:51:58,188
lf you don't like it,
please vanish from my world.

550
00:51:58,260 --> 00:52:00,160
No, l'm sorry,
she's not available.

551
00:52:00,262 --> 00:52:01,923
l know, darling.
You can't get--

552
00:52:01,997 --> 00:52:04,261
And she went to live
in a beautiful house...

553
00:52:04,366 --> 00:52:08,268
and all the people loved her,
and she was very, very happy.

554
00:52:08,336 --> 00:52:12,204
No, she's on her way to Rome then.
She's shooting Versace in Milan...

555
00:52:12,307 --> 00:52:14,104
and Yves St.-Laurent in Paris.

556
00:52:14,176 --> 00:52:16,940
Perry has her for
the only runway show she's doing.

557
00:52:17,045 --> 00:52:19,946
But the people in the village
were very poor...

558
00:52:20,015 --> 00:52:22,916
and every night, they crept
into the house where the girl slept...

559
00:52:23,018 --> 00:52:25,987
and they cut off a piece
of her golden hair...

560
00:52:26,087 --> 00:52:27,179
and they sold it for money.

561
00:52:27,289 --> 00:52:30,588
''She'll never even notice,''
they said.

562
00:52:30,692 --> 00:52:33,320
And so, all the gold
was gone from her head.

563
00:52:33,595 --> 00:52:36,029
lt's a real Cinderella story.

564
00:52:41,136 --> 00:52:43,832
Tell him to hurry.
Where's my tickets?

565
00:52:43,939 --> 00:52:45,201
You are wired.

566
00:52:46,942 --> 00:52:50,036
Here.
Try some of this.

567
00:52:51,379 --> 00:52:53,347
What? What is it?

568
00:52:53,415 --> 00:52:56,612
The answer to all your prayers.

569
00:53:36,224 --> 00:53:40,388
The only thing you have to remember
is that it's not about you.

570
00:53:40,662 --> 00:53:45,065
lt's not about you.
lt's not you that they're looking at.

571
00:53:45,133 --> 00:53:47,192
lt's not about you.

572
00:53:47,269 --> 00:53:50,830
l'm on top of that.
l understand that.

573
00:53:50,939 --> 00:53:53,999
Honey, that's good.
l'm so glad about that.

574
00:53:54,075 --> 00:53:58,910
Because if you let it be about you,
you're screwed, you know.

575
00:53:59,014 --> 00:54:02,313
So, you have to stay separate
from what's happening...

576
00:54:02,417 --> 00:54:05,215
and you have to be somewhere else.

577
00:54:05,320 --> 00:54:08,983
But l don't know where
that somewhere else is, you know?

578
00:54:09,090 --> 00:54:10,921
Or how to do that.

579
00:54:11,026 --> 00:54:14,894
Honey, you can do
whatever you want now.

580
00:54:14,996 --> 00:54:17,362
Yeah? What is it l want?

581
00:54:17,432 --> 00:54:19,400
What do l want?

582
00:54:33,315 --> 00:54:38,252
l will be king,
and you will be queen.

583
00:54:48,963 --> 00:54:51,864
l don't think a woman
is really a woman...

584
00:54:51,966 --> 00:54:54,059
unless she's a blonde, you know.

585
00:54:55,303 --> 00:54:58,306
Response is so enormous.

586
00:54:58,306 --> 00:55:00,900
l've never seen anything like it.

587
00:55:01,009 --> 00:55:03,341
And so fast, huh?

588
00:55:03,445 --> 00:55:06,243
About a million people
want to shoot you this month.

589
00:55:06,314 --> 00:55:09,112
We're going to name
a whole phone line after you.

590
00:55:11,286 --> 00:55:13,914
l could learn photography.

591
00:55:14,022 --> 00:55:16,149
That could be something l want.

592
00:55:16,257 --> 00:55:19,124
l could photograph children.

593
00:55:19,194 --> 00:55:21,924
l could have my own children.

594
00:55:22,030 --> 00:55:25,227
l would give them yellow roses.

595
00:55:25,333 --> 00:55:29,929
And if they got too loud,
l would just put them someplace quiet.

596
00:55:31,139 --> 00:55:33,039
l'd put them in the oven.

597
00:55:34,142 --> 00:55:36,406
And l would kiss them every day...

598
00:55:38,513 --> 00:55:41,414
and tell them,
''You don't have to be anybody...

599
00:55:41,516 --> 00:55:46,419
because l would know, being somebody
doesn't make you anybody anyway.''

600
00:55:49,190 --> 00:55:51,420
You will always be somebody to me.

601
00:55:54,529 --> 00:55:58,295
And on the financial front, with the
sudden illness of Wilhelmina Cooper...

602
00:55:58,366 --> 00:56:00,368
who's still hospitalized
in Manhattan...

603
00:56:00,368 --> 00:56:04,930
models and agents are competing
for the top talent and highest fees.

604
00:56:05,006 --> 00:56:07,133
With the latest news about inflation,
bonds rallied today...

605
00:56:07,242 --> 00:56:10,143
in reaction
to the president's speech.

606
00:56:10,245 --> 00:56:11,507
More news in a moment.

607
00:56:15,049 --> 00:56:18,485
She's doing all right. You know,
they're running some more tests.

608
00:56:18,586 --> 00:56:20,986
Maybe in a day or two
we'll know something.

609
00:56:22,090 --> 00:56:24,456
Come on, you gotta help me here.
l'm under a lot of pressure.

610
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:26,493
l can't give you any answers.

611
00:56:30,031 --> 00:56:31,931
l was thinking a lot
about you lately.

612
00:56:32,033 --> 00:56:34,866
lt's terrible, terrible,
isn't it?

613
00:56:34,969 --> 00:56:38,928
Mike Mansfield,
starting up the new Largo Agency.

614
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:41,474
What do you think
you're gonna do now?

615
00:56:41,576 --> 00:56:43,339
What do you mean?

616
00:56:43,445 --> 00:56:46,005
Well, you're a special girl...

617
00:56:48,049 --> 00:56:49,243
with special problems.

618
00:56:49,350 --> 00:56:51,910
l think you need special attention.

619
00:56:53,087 --> 00:56:55,021
You could go to Ford.

620
00:56:55,089 --> 00:56:59,025
There's always that asshole
over at Elite.

621
00:56:59,093 --> 00:57:02,290
But l think you should put
some serious thought in coming with me.

622
00:57:02,397 --> 00:57:04,388
Why? Why would l leave Wili?

623
00:57:06,501 --> 00:57:10,369
You have to start thinking
about yourself. You have to be tough.

624
00:57:10,438 --> 00:57:13,999
This is a business,
and in this business...

625
00:57:14,075 --> 00:57:16,543
you can't be represented
by a dead woman.

626
00:57:19,380 --> 00:57:20,369
Excuse me.

627
00:57:20,482 --> 00:57:23,042
Why don't you give me a call?

628
00:57:26,087 --> 00:57:28,282
Yes, darling, l know
it's so inconvenient.

629
00:57:28,389 --> 00:57:31,552
Get me a copy of the call sheet,
and tell Freddie l need to speak to him.

630
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,155
- Done. l'll take care of it.
- Gia, darling, kiss me.

631
00:57:34,262 --> 00:57:37,129
Yes, l have to go too.

632
00:57:37,232 --> 00:57:42,329
Have a wonderful trip.
Tell Christian to behave himself.

633
00:57:42,437 --> 00:57:44,337
Ciao, darling.

634
00:57:46,307 --> 00:57:49,242
- l'm exhausted.
- Me too.

635
00:57:50,945 --> 00:57:53,539
Come here, come here, come here.

636
00:57:56,184 --> 00:57:58,015
l thought you were sick.

637
00:57:58,119 --> 00:58:01,987
l am sick, darling,
sick and tired...

638
00:58:02,056 --> 00:58:04,547
but it's not serious.

639
00:58:07,362 --> 00:58:09,557
- l'm tired too.
- You?

640
00:58:09,964 --> 00:58:11,295
Yeah.

641
00:58:11,399 --> 00:58:14,891
l think l wanna stop for a while.

642
00:58:14,969 --> 00:58:17,301
You know,
l need some time to think.

643
00:58:17,405 --> 00:58:21,341
Yes, but not now, darling.

644
00:58:21,409 --> 00:58:25,971
Plenty of time to rest
when you're in the ground.

645
00:58:26,548 --> 00:58:28,448
You have...

646
00:58:28,550 --> 00:58:32,077
the whole world...

647
00:58:32,186 --> 00:58:35,121
at your fingertips.

648
00:58:35,189 --> 00:58:40,525
You have to be strong.
Seize the moment.

649
00:58:41,596 --> 00:58:44,565
Because if you don't...

650
00:58:44,766 --> 00:58:47,291
there's always another girl
waiting right behind you...

651
00:58:47,368 --> 00:58:50,303
breathing over your shoulder.

652
00:58:55,777 --> 00:58:57,335
Come on.

653
00:58:58,613 --> 00:59:01,946
l know. l know it's hard.

654
00:59:02,050 --> 00:59:03,984
We can do it.

655
00:59:06,020 --> 00:59:08,284
You and l together.

656
00:59:19,400 --> 00:59:22,130
She really looked dead, didn't she?

657
00:59:22,236 --> 00:59:24,363
The great thing about the afterlife
is nobody cares how you look.

658
00:59:24,472 --> 00:59:26,064
Like an average girl.

659
00:59:27,642 --> 00:59:30,133
Too rich and too thin.

660
00:59:31,312 --> 00:59:36,477
- l had no idea she was that sick.
- You can never tell with Germans.

661
01:00:03,811 --> 01:00:05,244
God!

662
01:00:54,328 --> 01:00:57,161
Great. That's beautiful.

663
01:00:57,265 --> 01:00:58,857
Really nice. Cool.

664
01:00:59,100 --> 01:01:01,534
Can you roll your eyes back a little
so we can see the white under them?

665
01:01:01,769 --> 01:01:04,761
- We're going for the seppuku look.
- What is that?

666
01:01:04,872 --> 01:01:08,171
Japanese. Sorry, it means
that you're half dead.

667
01:01:08,276 --> 01:01:10,540
- l'm there.
- l know, it's great.

668
01:01:10,611 --> 01:01:14,570
You are doing so good.

669
01:01:16,117 --> 01:01:17,379
Really, you look super.

670
01:01:19,454 --> 01:01:21,422
Oh, my God.
Did you almost just throw up?

671
01:01:21,522 --> 01:01:23,547
l'm really sick.

672
01:01:23,624 --> 01:01:27,583
- Can you go make a run downtown for me?
- Don't throw up on this dress.

673
01:01:27,829 --> 01:01:30,320
Just-- l'm sick.
Go downtown.

674
01:01:30,431 --> 01:01:34,527
All right? There's a taco place,
and you ask for Satellite or Rich Boy.

675
01:01:34,769 --> 01:01:36,828
Okay? Yeah?

676
01:01:36,938 --> 01:01:39,236
- Chasing the dragon, are you?
- l'm sorry.

677
01:01:39,307 --> 01:01:43,505
Oh, no, it works, it works.
A little death around the eyes.

678
01:01:43,611 --> 01:01:48,105
Okay, great. Fabulous.
Great. Good.

679
01:01:48,216 --> 01:01:50,741
That's really great.
Oh, that's great.

680
01:01:54,322 --> 01:01:59,419
Fantastic. Right by the bike.
Good. Bad girl, bad girl.

681
01:01:59,494 --> 01:02:01,189
Good.

682
01:02:03,464 --> 01:02:04,829
Yeah, that's it. Great.

683
01:02:04,932 --> 01:02:08,390
Good. Fantastic.

684
01:02:08,503 --> 01:02:12,371
- She's out of her fucking mind?
- Could Cheryl Tiegs do this?

685
01:02:12,473 --> 01:02:14,441
l don't think so.

686
01:02:16,444 --> 01:02:17,809
Go.

687
01:02:26,854 --> 01:02:31,791
Hey, wait!
Hey, where you going?

688
01:03:53,808 --> 01:03:56,504
Hey, where's Satellite?
ls he here?

689
01:04:00,848 --> 01:04:02,247
Come here.

690
01:04:03,517 --> 01:04:04,916
Fuck.

691
01:04:36,784 --> 01:04:37,910
Hey, you bitch.

692
01:05:11,852 --> 01:05:12,876
Where's Satellite?

693
01:05:14,822 --> 01:05:16,790
Where is Satellite?

694
01:05:19,894 --> 01:05:25,355
l am sick, fucking junkies.
l'm sick! Where is he?

695
01:05:25,466 --> 01:05:27,593
He's making a delivery.

696
01:05:30,004 --> 01:05:34,600
- ls anybody holding anything? Please!
- l'll give you my shot.

697
01:05:37,011 --> 01:05:40,105
l don't shoot. Do you have
anything else dry?

698
01:05:40,181 --> 01:05:42,046
No, man.

699
01:05:42,149 --> 01:05:43,810
All l got is in here.

700
01:05:46,020 --> 01:05:47,578
l can't.

701
01:05:50,091 --> 01:05:53,151
- Okay, if you don't want it.
- Wait.

702
01:05:57,865 --> 01:06:00,356
l want it. You do me.
Will you do it?

703
01:06:05,473 --> 01:06:06,963
Yeah, l'll do you.

704
01:06:23,057 --> 01:06:24,991
This is gonna hurt.

705
01:06:27,028 --> 01:06:28,552
No pain.

706
01:06:31,499 --> 01:06:32,966
Thank you.

707
01:06:35,669 --> 01:06:37,432
Don't be scared, baby.

708
01:06:38,639 --> 01:06:40,129
l'll take you home.

709
01:06:42,843 --> 01:06:44,208
Oh, God.

710
01:07:24,585 --> 01:07:26,109
Oh, my God.

711
01:07:28,556 --> 01:07:30,956
l was thinking about you.

712
01:07:39,166 --> 01:07:40,861
Are you okay?

713
01:07:46,140 --> 01:07:48,074
ls your boyfriend here?

714
01:07:49,610 --> 01:07:51,840
l don't have a boyfriend anymore.

715
01:08:02,857 --> 01:08:04,222
l'm all dirty.

716
01:08:36,357 --> 01:08:39,121
l was afraid of the drugs.

717
01:08:39,226 --> 01:08:41,558
The way people use them.

718
01:08:41,662 --> 01:08:44,153
l told her that.
l mean, she knew that.

719
01:08:45,266 --> 01:08:47,530
l was afraid of a lot of things.

720
01:08:47,635 --> 01:08:50,798
But she promised...

721
01:08:51,372 --> 01:08:53,135
and l believed her.

722
01:08:53,240 --> 01:08:57,233
And l believed
we could make things work.

723
01:08:57,344 --> 01:09:01,075
l believed because we both
wanted it so much that we could.

724
01:09:01,182 --> 01:09:02,843
We could--

725
01:09:05,853 --> 01:09:07,252
And we did.

726
01:09:08,956 --> 01:09:10,890
We did make it work.

727
01:09:20,701 --> 01:09:22,635
You're coming home?

728
01:09:23,637 --> 01:09:25,229
Just out of the blue
you're coming home?

729
01:09:25,339 --> 01:09:27,239
Just like that you call me?

730
01:09:29,677 --> 01:09:31,838
You are a piece of work,
you are.

731
01:09:31,946 --> 01:09:33,937
Philadelphia?

732
01:09:34,048 --> 01:09:36,573
The bitch is in Philadelphia?

733
01:09:36,684 --> 01:09:40,381
l'm killing myself
trying to keep this agency alive...

734
01:09:40,654 --> 01:09:42,178
which is not easy...

735
01:09:42,289 --> 01:09:46,919
since my wife with her dying breath
screwed me out of 50% of the company.

736
01:09:47,027 --> 01:09:49,291
Fucking women.

737
01:09:49,396 --> 01:09:51,330
And now you tell me
this little...

738
01:09:52,199 --> 01:09:55,066
whatever just disappears.

739
01:09:55,135 --> 01:09:58,298
l hope she fucking dies
in Philadelphia.

740
01:10:01,442 --> 01:10:03,376
lt's a 21-day program.

741
01:10:03,644 --> 01:10:07,842
lt's your responsibility to come in
every day and take the Methodone.

742
01:10:11,085 --> 01:10:13,349
All right.
Drink the water.

743
01:10:14,221 --> 01:10:15,882
That's all right.

744
01:10:15,956 --> 01:10:18,083
l need you to drink the water.

745
01:10:23,230 --> 01:10:25,960
And sign next to the line.

746
01:10:37,211 --> 01:10:38,872
Okay.

747
01:10:41,148 --> 01:10:43,173
Dwayne King.

748
01:10:44,051 --> 01:10:47,111
There you are, Mr. Doodiekins.
Fresh from the oven.

749
01:10:47,221 --> 01:10:48,950
Thank you, Mrs. Doodiekins.

750
01:10:59,333 --> 01:11:01,028
l could do this,
you know that?

751
01:11:01,101 --> 01:11:03,296
l could be a fucking housewife.

752
01:11:03,404 --> 01:11:05,065
l'd be very happy.

753
01:11:21,221 --> 01:11:24,124
lt's very depressing,
this apartment.

754
01:11:24,124 --> 01:11:26,991
All right, all right.
''Shut up, Mom.''

755
01:11:27,094 --> 01:11:28,994
So, is Linda coming back tonight...

756
01:11:29,096 --> 01:11:30,996
or is she staying in New York?

757
01:11:31,098 --> 01:11:33,828
l don't know.
lf she works late, she's gonna stay.

758
01:11:35,302 --> 01:11:39,398
l hate what this Methodone
is doing to your shoulders.

759
01:11:39,473 --> 01:11:43,068
They used to stand up so straight,
so beautiful.

760
01:11:43,177 --> 01:11:44,872
Come on.

761
01:11:50,884 --> 01:11:53,876
Well, you have to watch
your weight too.

762
01:11:53,987 --> 01:11:56,285
You want to look good
for when you go back to work.

763
01:11:58,258 --> 01:12:00,158
- l'm not going back to work.
- Okay.

764
01:12:00,260 --> 01:12:01,921
- l can't.
- All right.

765
01:12:01,995 --> 01:12:03,963
Do you understand that?

766
01:12:05,265 --> 01:12:07,927
That's up to you, you know.

767
01:12:08,001 --> 01:12:10,265
But just wait. You'll see.

768
01:12:19,113 --> 01:12:21,946
Hi, this is Linda.
l'm not here. Leave a message.

769
01:12:22,516 --> 01:12:24,381
Hi, Doo-doo. lt's me.

770
01:12:24,485 --> 01:12:27,249
l've been calling all night.
Where are you?

771
01:12:28,355 --> 01:12:30,414
- Linda?
- Hello?

772
01:12:31,558 --> 01:12:35,392
- Who's this?
- This is Billy. Who's this?

773
01:12:46,073 --> 01:12:49,338
Damn it!
Goddamn it, Gia!

774
01:12:50,444 --> 01:12:53,345
Oh, my God,
she broke into my house.

775
01:12:53,447 --> 01:12:56,314
She stole some money.

776
01:12:56,417 --> 01:12:59,443
She stole jewelry.
She bought the drugs...

777
01:12:59,520 --> 01:13:02,318
and then she took off in the car
like a crazy person.

778
01:13:02,389 --> 01:13:04,857
lt was unbelievable.

779
01:13:04,958 --> 01:13:06,858
She took my wedding ring!

780
01:13:06,960 --> 01:13:09,861
- Stop the vehicle and pull over.
- And the lies.

781
01:13:10,497 --> 01:13:14,433
You know that old joke, how you
can tell when a junkie is lying?

782
01:13:14,535 --> 01:13:16,435
Her lips are moving.

783
01:13:17,337 --> 01:13:19,271
lt's not funny.

784
01:13:30,284 --> 01:13:32,081
Get out of the car.

785
01:13:34,121 --> 01:13:36,316
- Why are you chasing me? Are you crazy?
- Lady--

786
01:13:36,423 --> 01:13:38,857
l'm trying to get to New York,
and you're fucking chasing me?

787
01:13:38,926 --> 01:13:41,360
- All right, ma'am. Calm down.
- What is wrong with you?

788
01:13:41,462 --> 01:13:43,862
- God! What?
- Ma'am?

789
01:13:44,398 --> 01:13:48,164
What the-- Just back off, okay?
God!

790
01:13:48,235 --> 01:13:50,499
- Ma'am?
- l have to go.

791
01:13:55,909 --> 01:13:57,843
Get fucking arrested for nothing,
that's why.

792
01:13:57,911 --> 01:14:00,311
These are serious charges.
Reckless driving.

793
01:14:00,414 --> 01:14:03,850
- This is resisting arrest.
- Goddamn it! lt's not my fault!

794
01:14:03,917 --> 01:14:05,384
lt was not my fault either!

795
01:14:05,486 --> 01:14:07,386
He was there getting some stuff
out of my apartment!

796
01:14:07,488 --> 01:14:10,184
l wasn't even there!
l was on my way back here!

797
01:14:11,959 --> 01:14:14,484
Thank God, because otherwise,
you'd still be in jail.

798
01:14:14,561 --> 01:14:16,495
l have to go back to work.

799
01:14:16,897 --> 01:14:18,956
l know what you're gonna say,
but l need the money.

800
01:14:20,167 --> 01:14:22,135
Stop it!

801
01:14:22,202 --> 01:14:26,195
l need the money so l can be with you,
because l cannot live like this.

802
01:14:26,306 --> 01:14:29,139
Okay ? l can't live like this.

803
01:14:29,209 --> 01:14:31,302
And l can't live without you.

804
01:14:32,913 --> 01:14:34,471
You want to come to Largo now.

805
01:14:36,984 --> 01:14:39,145
ls that because everyone else
is afraid of signing you?

806
01:14:39,219 --> 01:14:41,210
No, l haven't asked anyone else.

807
01:14:41,321 --> 01:14:43,186
Then why me?

808
01:14:44,057 --> 01:14:46,048
Because you're a greedy fuck...

809
01:14:46,159 --> 01:14:49,219
and you'll get me more money
than anyone else.

810
01:14:49,296 --> 01:14:50,991
That's the truth.

811
01:14:55,335 --> 01:14:58,270
So, let me be truthful with you.

812
01:15:01,174 --> 01:15:04,109
Everyone's aware of the drug problem.

813
01:15:04,211 --> 01:15:05,473
You weren't very discreet.

814
01:15:06,480 --> 01:15:08,914
Well, l'm clean now...

815
01:15:08,982 --> 01:15:11,280
and l want to work.

816
01:15:17,524 --> 01:15:19,458
Let me see your arms.

817
01:15:22,029 --> 01:15:24,520
lt's not my arms you want.
lt's my face...

818
01:15:24,731 --> 01:15:26,528
and my tits.

819
01:15:26,733 --> 01:15:28,530
And they're fine.

820
01:15:34,074 --> 01:15:35,974
We're doing a television piece
on models.

821
01:15:36,076 --> 01:15:38,476
l want you to be in it.

822
01:15:38,579 --> 01:15:42,447
l want you to look more beautiful...

823
01:15:42,516 --> 01:15:45,178
than you have ever looked.

824
01:15:45,285 --> 01:15:48,049
And l want you to tell the world...

825
01:15:49,056 --> 01:15:53,390
that you once had a drug problem
and now you don't.

826
01:15:53,493 --> 01:15:56,189
Now you're a good little girl.

827
01:15:59,499 --> 01:16:01,296
lf you do that...

828
01:16:02,469 --> 01:16:04,266
we have a deal.

829
01:16:13,213 --> 01:16:14,578
Okay.

830
01:16:17,584 --> 01:16:19,484
Good.

831
01:16:24,291 --> 01:16:26,316
- l can't do this.
- Yes, you can.

832
01:16:26,426 --> 01:16:28,326
l'm a model. l don't talk.

833
01:16:28,428 --> 01:16:31,329
l'm not supposed to talk.
l'm supposed to just look beautiful.

834
01:16:32,432 --> 01:16:34,263
You are beautiful.

835
01:16:35,202 --> 01:16:37,329
You make me beautiful.

836
01:16:37,437 --> 01:16:39,132
Hello.

837
01:16:39,239 --> 01:16:41,002
Okay. We're all set.

838
01:16:41,074 --> 01:16:43,474
l'm gonna tape you getting made up.
Kind of a before and after thing.

839
01:16:43,577 --> 01:16:45,738
- Great.
- We've also got some interviews...

840
01:16:45,846 --> 01:16:48,041
set up with your friends,
your family, your mother.

841
01:16:48,115 --> 01:16:50,140
You're gonna
put my mother on tape?

842
01:16:50,250 --> 01:16:53,515
- Yes, most definitely.
- Well, that should be interesting.

843
01:16:56,256 --> 01:16:58,781
- You ready?
- Yeah.

844
01:16:59,059 --> 01:17:00,151
Good.

845
01:17:01,328 --> 01:17:04,058
- l just have to go to the bathroom.
- Sure.

846
01:17:05,465 --> 01:17:07,831
Why don't you guys come over here?
This is what l want.

847
01:17:54,514 --> 01:17:57,415
And how did things first start
for you in modeling?

848
01:17:58,485 --> 01:18:02,751
l started working
with very good people.

849
01:18:02,823 --> 01:18:06,122
A lot of them.
Very fast, you know?

850
01:18:06,226 --> 01:18:10,390
l didn't build
into being a model.

851
01:18:10,464 --> 01:18:12,796
l just sort of became one.

852
01:18:12,899 --> 01:18:15,367
How has that affected you?

853
01:18:18,271 --> 01:18:21,297
When you're young,
you don't always know.

854
01:18:22,275 --> 01:18:26,541
lt's hard to make out
the difference between...

855
01:18:26,613 --> 01:18:29,207
what's real and what is not real.

856
01:18:30,884 --> 01:18:33,444
At one point you...

857
01:18:33,553 --> 01:18:36,386
kind of got into
the drug scene, didn't you?

858
01:18:40,827 --> 01:18:43,796
Yes, you could say that l did.

859
01:18:43,897 --> 01:18:46,127
But you're free of it now,
aren't you?

860
01:18:47,901 --> 01:18:50,335
Definitely, l'm free of it.

861
01:18:50,437 --> 01:18:53,838
l wouldn't be here right now
talking to all of you if l wasn't.

862
01:18:53,940 --> 01:18:55,908
Are you happy with your success?

863
01:18:59,379 --> 01:19:01,472
Are you happy with your success?

864
01:19:01,548 --> 01:19:03,243
l am.

865
01:19:04,451 --> 01:19:07,181
Yes. Yeah.

866
01:19:08,855 --> 01:19:10,413
You hesitated.

867
01:19:12,325 --> 01:19:16,386
l just wanted to think about it.
But, no, l'm definitely happy with it.

868
01:19:16,496 --> 01:19:18,828
Good. Thank you.

869
01:19:18,932 --> 01:19:20,900
Yeah, thank you.

870
01:19:42,289 --> 01:19:45,281
Fuck! What the fuck?

871
01:19:46,326 --> 01:19:49,227
l, like, kicked Spider-Man's ass!

872
01:19:54,901 --> 01:19:56,425
l'm sorry.

873
01:20:04,244 --> 01:20:06,007
l just wanted to make you smile.

874
01:20:13,019 --> 01:20:14,543
Okay.

875
01:20:14,788 --> 01:20:17,279
Okay, l'm going.
Last chance.

876
01:20:19,559 --> 01:20:22,357
l'm leaving
through the front door.

877
01:20:22,429 --> 01:20:24,363
l can't do this.

878
01:20:24,431 --> 01:20:26,365
Don't say that.
Just say you'll see me tomorrow.

879
01:20:26,433 --> 01:20:29,334
- No, you won't see me tomorrow.
- Don't say that!

880
01:20:31,471 --> 01:20:34,338
We had a deal.
We made a bargain.

881
01:20:38,778 --> 01:20:40,336
l love you.

882
01:20:42,082 --> 01:20:43,743
No, you don't.

883
01:20:45,518 --> 01:20:47,850
All right, l don't.
l don't.

884
01:20:51,458 --> 01:20:54,791
What are you, huh?
You some kind of fucking policeman?

885
01:20:54,895 --> 01:20:57,489
You going to judge me?
l did one fucking line.

886
01:20:57,597 --> 01:20:59,531
One line.

887
01:20:59,766 --> 01:21:01,927
What is the big deal?

888
01:21:02,035 --> 01:21:05,004
What about yesterday?
What about the day before?

889
01:21:08,441 --> 01:21:09,965
Nothing.

890
01:21:10,877 --> 01:21:12,811
l did nothing. l promise.

891
01:21:12,913 --> 01:21:14,847
Please don't leave me.

892
01:21:14,948 --> 01:21:16,848
l don't believe you.

893
01:21:20,487 --> 01:21:23,320
You don't believe me because
you don't want to believe me, do you?

894
01:21:23,423 --> 01:21:26,290
Because you don't care!
Because you just wanted to say...

895
01:21:26,359 --> 01:21:28,293
''l'm fucking a model!''

896
01:21:29,329 --> 01:21:31,092
You don't care about me
at all, do you?

897
01:21:31,331 --> 01:21:34,823
Do you? Tell me you don't care!
Say, ''l don't care!''

898
01:21:54,621 --> 01:21:57,317
Please. l'm sorry.

899
01:21:58,992 --> 01:22:01,961
l need you so much.
Don't make me do this.

900
01:22:04,931 --> 01:22:06,899
l don't make you do anything.

901
01:22:07,000 --> 01:22:08,900
l wish l could.

902
01:22:10,003 --> 01:22:11,561
You could.

903
01:22:15,175 --> 01:22:17,109
You could take care of me.

904
01:22:25,819 --> 01:22:27,582
Do you have $30?

905
01:22:32,092 --> 01:22:34,117
l don't have any money.

906
01:22:34,394 --> 01:22:36,157
l don't know why.
l never have it.

907
01:22:36,396 --> 01:22:38,159
l never have any money.

908
01:22:43,503 --> 01:22:45,368
ln my sock.

909
01:23:01,187 --> 01:23:04,384
- This is what makes you do everything.
- No, it doesn't.

910
01:23:04,491 --> 01:23:07,187
lt's not me. lt's not you.
lt's this.

911
01:23:07,460 --> 01:23:09,189
This shit holds you.

912
01:23:11,064 --> 01:23:13,589
- You choose.
- Come on.

913
01:23:14,834 --> 01:23:17,803
This or me.

914
01:23:30,550 --> 01:23:32,040
Your finger.

915
01:23:34,587 --> 01:23:36,077
Your knees.

916
01:23:39,893 --> 01:23:41,224
Your skin.

917
01:23:42,495 --> 01:23:43,985
Your toes.

918
01:23:54,240 --> 01:23:55,867
l love you.

919
01:25:43,149 --> 01:25:44,810
Change.

920
01:26:10,376 --> 01:26:12,344
She is over.

921
01:26:14,214 --> 01:26:16,148
lt's just a question
of time now.

922
01:26:23,389 --> 01:26:25,016
Hey, come on.

923
01:26:28,394 --> 01:26:31,227
- Hi.
- Yes, you are.

924
01:26:31,331 --> 01:26:33,196
You dropped this, honey.

925
01:26:34,234 --> 01:26:36,828
You want to come on and finish
this fiasco?

926
01:26:47,080 --> 01:26:49,014
You look so pretty.

927
01:26:54,687 --> 01:26:56,177
Thanks.

928
01:26:58,091 --> 01:26:59,649
l love you.

929
01:27:01,694 --> 01:27:04,026
l know.
You love everybody.

930
01:27:11,170 --> 01:27:13,365
Gia, listen to me.
l am trying to get you work.

931
01:27:13,439 --> 01:27:15,999
But it's all spring stuff now.

932
01:27:16,075 --> 01:27:19,272
Everybody wants the blonds
with the suntans and the sundresses.

933
01:27:19,379 --> 01:27:22,143
l'm sorry.
No, your look is not spring.

934
01:27:22,215 --> 01:27:24,376
Your look is more like nuclear
fucking winter, and nobody wants it.

935
01:27:24,484 --> 01:27:26,884
Hang up the phone.

936
01:27:26,953 --> 01:27:28,887
l am so tense.

937
01:27:28,955 --> 01:27:31,651
Ron, can you use some of
those fucking muscles?

938
01:27:33,092 --> 01:27:34,423
l'm so tense.

939
01:27:35,828 --> 01:27:40,094
''When she kisses me, l feel
all four winds blow at my face.

940
01:27:40,199 --> 01:27:44,397
But what do you do with a woman
who has no love for you?

941
01:27:52,211 --> 01:27:54,941
She is my lost captive...

942
01:27:55,048 --> 01:27:58,449
and no longer lies
along my legs.''

943
01:28:02,388 --> 01:28:04,322
l wrote that for you.

944
01:28:45,998 --> 01:28:49,832
- Why did they send her out?
- Because l asked for her.

945
01:28:49,936 --> 01:28:51,403
- All right?
- All right.

946
01:29:03,149 --> 01:29:05,049
We use them up...

947
01:29:06,018 --> 01:29:07,952
throw them away.

948
01:29:16,195 --> 01:29:18,026
Where's my knife?

949
01:29:18,131 --> 01:29:20,224
l haven't seen it.

950
01:29:20,333 --> 01:29:22,267
Who took my fucking knife?

951
01:29:24,036 --> 01:29:27,028
Do l look like a fucking terrorist?
ls this funny?

952
01:29:27,140 --> 01:29:30,974
What the fuck is wrong with you people?
Get the fuck away from me!

953
01:29:31,043 --> 01:29:34,103
Get away!
Where's my knife?

954
01:29:36,382 --> 01:29:38,043
Here it is.

955
01:29:42,989 --> 01:29:44,957
You know, you can't do that.

956
01:29:45,057 --> 01:29:47,150
You can't take somebody's knife
when they need it!

957
01:29:47,260 --> 01:29:49,888
lt's all right. lt's fine.

958
01:29:51,130 --> 01:29:54,122
- Look at those tracks on her arms.
- Okay, now.

959
01:29:54,233 --> 01:29:56,258
And that awful thing
on her hand.

960
01:29:56,369 --> 01:29:58,394
- lt looks like a volcano.
- All right.

961
01:30:02,442 --> 01:30:04,342
Try folding your arms.

962
01:30:08,080 --> 01:30:10,048
Put them in back of you.

963
01:30:11,083 --> 01:30:13,051
Well, you've almost got it.

964
01:30:13,119 --> 01:30:15,144
Now, try sitting on your hands.

965
01:30:17,890 --> 01:30:19,255
Yes, yes.

966
01:30:21,260 --> 01:30:22,921
You look wonderful.

967
01:30:24,564 --> 01:30:26,225
Beautiful.

968
01:30:39,378 --> 01:30:42,142
- Francesco?
- Yes, sweetheart?

969
01:30:43,416 --> 01:30:45,111
Thank you.

970
01:30:47,920 --> 01:30:52,152
Gia, this is life, not heaven.

971
01:30:52,258 --> 01:30:54,158
You don't have to be perfect.

972
01:30:56,262 --> 01:30:59,857
Look at me. Where's those eyes?
Where's the mouth?

973
01:30:59,966 --> 01:31:03,231
What? You're not!

974
01:31:03,302 --> 01:31:05,236
Truly? You're on an airplane?

975
01:31:06,239 --> 01:31:07,866
Oh, my God! Listen to me!

976
01:31:07,974 --> 01:31:10,135
l'm so excited! l'm yelling!

977
01:31:10,243 --> 01:31:12,143
l don't have to yell, do l?

978
01:31:12,245 --> 01:31:15,078
- No, you don't have to yell.
- Henry!

979
01:31:15,181 --> 01:31:18,378
- Mom, l don't want to talk to Henry.
- Where is he? Hold on.

980
01:31:20,119 --> 01:31:21,916
Where are you?

981
01:31:21,988 --> 01:31:23,922
l mean, where is the airplane?

982
01:31:23,990 --> 01:31:26,925
l've never talked to anybody
on an airplane before.

983
01:31:28,261 --> 01:31:30,229
l was in Paris...

984
01:31:30,296 --> 01:31:32,526
and l think
l'm going to Munich.

985
01:31:33,699 --> 01:31:35,428
l don't know.

986
01:31:36,502 --> 01:31:38,436
l don't feel so good.

987
01:31:40,206 --> 01:31:43,004
Well, honey, you're probably
just tired, you know?

988
01:31:44,043 --> 01:31:45,408
Yeah...

989
01:31:45,511 --> 01:31:47,445
and l'm cold.

990
01:31:50,316 --> 01:31:52,216
You know...

991
01:31:53,452 --> 01:31:56,285
l was thinking about
coming home again.

992
01:31:56,355 --> 01:31:58,050
What do you think?

993
01:32:03,396 --> 01:32:05,990
Honey, l don't think so.

994
01:32:07,099 --> 01:32:08,964
You know?

995
01:32:13,406 --> 01:32:17,968
l mean, you know,
after the last time.

996
01:32:18,077 --> 01:32:20,272
Yeah, l know. Of course.

997
01:32:32,191 --> 01:32:33,624
l'm sorry.

998
01:32:37,430 --> 01:32:38,988
Yeah.

999
01:32:43,703 --> 01:32:45,227
l better go.

1000
01:32:46,772 --> 01:32:48,740
All right. Okay.

1001
01:32:49,008 --> 01:32:50,475
Listen to me.

1002
01:32:50,710 --> 01:32:52,769
Now, you take care of yourself.

1003
01:32:53,045 --> 01:32:54,774
Okay?

1004
01:32:55,047 --> 01:32:57,140
You call me.

1005
01:32:57,249 --> 01:32:59,274
Because l love you.

1006
01:32:59,385 --> 01:33:02,684
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

1007
01:34:02,381 --> 01:34:05,145
Every model has a moment--

1008
01:34:05,217 --> 01:34:07,151
l mean, the ones who
make it at all--

1009
01:34:07,253 --> 01:34:09,153
and whether or not
they can parlay that moment...

1010
01:34:09,255 --> 01:34:12,190
into some kind of a career--

1011
01:34:12,291 --> 01:34:14,350
well, that's the gamble,
isn't it?

1012
01:34:15,294 --> 01:34:17,353
'Cause the moment
is a very short time.

1013
01:34:17,430 --> 01:34:19,864
lt's here and then it's gone,
just like most of these girls.

1014
01:34:20,132 --> 01:34:22,066
They're here...

1015
01:34:22,168 --> 01:34:24,068
and then they're gone.

1016
01:34:27,473 --> 01:34:29,464
When she came back to New York...

1017
01:34:29,575 --> 01:34:31,805
l was in Philadelphia.

1018
01:34:31,911 --> 01:34:34,709
And l heard some things.

1019
01:34:34,780 --> 01:34:37,180
A lot of things.

1020
01:34:37,283 --> 01:34:39,376
So l took the train
up to see her.

1021
01:35:01,373 --> 01:35:03,273
l can't find my money.

1022
01:35:04,443 --> 01:35:07,844
- What?
- l had $600, and l can't find it.

1023
01:35:17,389 --> 01:35:18,913
What's going on?

1024
01:35:19,158 --> 01:35:21,126
l can't find my money!

1025
01:35:22,328 --> 01:35:23,818
What's wrong with you?

1026
01:35:25,164 --> 01:35:27,291
What are you doing?

1027
01:35:27,399 --> 01:35:30,800
- Do you have any money?
- No, l don't have any money.

1028
01:35:32,505 --> 01:35:34,439
You want to fuck me?

1029
01:35:36,408 --> 01:35:38,399
You give me money,
l'll let you fuck me.

1030
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:44,142
- Come here.
- What?

1031
01:35:46,886 --> 01:35:48,820
Get off! What?

1032
01:35:51,290 --> 01:35:53,224
- Can l please hold you?
- Get off!

1033
01:35:54,426 --> 01:35:55,950
No drugs.

1034
01:35:57,229 --> 01:35:58,856
Get off of me!

1035
01:35:58,964 --> 01:36:00,556
- Calm down.
- Okay.

1036
01:36:19,351 --> 01:36:21,581
Okay, do you have
any medical insurance?

1037
01:36:23,889 --> 01:36:27,416
- Can you pay cash for this?
- No, l don't have any money.

1038
01:36:30,229 --> 01:36:32,197
Stupid question.

1039
01:36:34,400 --> 01:36:36,891
All right. You'll have to
declare yourself indigent.

1040
01:36:37,002 --> 01:36:38,902
Do you understand that?

1041
01:37:18,577 --> 01:37:20,272
Wait a minute.

1042
01:37:20,379 --> 01:37:24,782
What, am l supposed to feel sorry
for you because you're beautiful?

1043
01:37:24,850 --> 01:37:29,378
Because you made 10,000 a minute
doing fucking nothing?

1044
01:37:29,455 --> 01:37:32,788
''Oh, it was so hard,
so terrible.

1045
01:37:32,892 --> 01:37:34,917
They treated me so bad.''

1046
01:37:35,027 --> 01:37:37,723
Listen, girl.
You had a free ride...

1047
01:37:37,830 --> 01:37:39,730
and you fucking blew it.

1048
01:37:46,372 --> 01:37:47,862
And me?

1049
01:37:47,940 --> 01:37:50,374
l'm some kid from Ohio...

1050
01:37:50,442 --> 01:37:54,811
reading fashion magazines,
looking at your picture and thinking...

1051
01:37:54,914 --> 01:37:57,542
''l'm supposed to look like that''...

1052
01:37:57,783 --> 01:38:01,480
and going fucking crazy
because l don't.

1053
01:38:01,587 --> 01:38:04,456
Because nobody told me
it was a lie.

1054
01:38:04,456 --> 01:38:08,825
Because the magazine doesn't come
with a label that says...

1055
01:38:08,894 --> 01:38:12,887
''Caution. This is a lie.
Nobody looks like this.''

1056
01:38:12,965 --> 01:38:15,729
Not even you.

1057
01:38:23,509 --> 01:38:26,808
Well, they asked me to go
to the sessions, so l did.

1058
01:38:26,912 --> 01:38:28,436
l tried.

1059
01:38:29,381 --> 01:38:32,407
l just got so mad.
l got so mad.

1060
01:38:34,086 --> 01:38:37,419
l said to them, ''Look, l'm not
the drug addict here.

1061
01:38:37,523 --> 01:38:40,515
l'm not the one that
you should be ripping apart.''

1062
01:38:42,361 --> 01:38:44,488
l said, ''This is all buried.

1063
01:38:44,596 --> 01:38:47,429
Why don't you just let it be?''

1064
01:38:47,499 --> 01:38:50,024
That's what l told 'em.
Look. l know.

1065
01:38:50,135 --> 01:38:52,467
You want to blame somebody.
You want to blame me.

1066
01:38:52,571 --> 01:38:54,732
Okay, go ahead.
Knock yourself out.

1067
01:38:56,075 --> 01:38:57,975
But just remember this:

1068
01:38:58,077 --> 01:39:00,978
Everything l did,
l did because l loved her.

1069
01:39:01,847 --> 01:39:03,781
And l believe
that it was my love...

1070
01:39:03,849 --> 01:39:06,750
and my prayers
that got her through that.

1071
01:39:19,064 --> 01:39:21,430
Hi, Linda. lt's Gia.

1072
01:39:21,533 --> 01:39:23,763
l'm calling to apologize.

1073
01:39:24,870 --> 01:39:27,065
l'm in this program...

1074
01:39:27,172 --> 01:39:30,539
and it's, like, part of the program
that we're supposed to...

1075
01:39:30,642 --> 01:39:34,043
ask forgiveness of the people
that we hurt when we were drugging.

1076
01:39:35,080 --> 01:39:39,016
l was, like, ''Well, fuck, man.
That could take the rest of my life.''

1077
01:39:42,054 --> 01:39:43,817
l'm sorry.

1078
01:39:43,889 --> 01:39:45,447
This is stupid.

1079
01:39:51,030 --> 01:39:54,727
Anyway, l'm calling
to ask forgiveness...

1080
01:39:54,833 --> 01:39:57,996
and to say that l miss you,
because--

1081
01:40:00,205 --> 01:40:03,003
What is that?
Am l done?

1082
01:40:03,075 --> 01:40:05,908
l think l'm done.
l don't know what happened.

1083
01:40:06,011 --> 01:40:07,774
Hi, it's me.

1084
01:40:15,454 --> 01:40:16,944
Boy, Linda.

1085
01:40:19,058 --> 01:40:20,548
Yeah.

1086
01:40:27,966 --> 01:40:30,196
Well, now l don't know
what to say.

1087
01:40:32,104 --> 01:40:35,870
lt's okay. l heard you.
l heard it all.

1088
01:40:37,142 --> 01:40:38,837
ls that okay?

1089
01:40:40,546 --> 01:40:42,514
Yeah.

1090
01:40:52,524 --> 01:40:55,823
l can't talk right now.
l have to go.

1091
01:40:55,894 --> 01:40:57,987
Can l call you in a few days?

1092
01:41:00,966 --> 01:41:03,833
l'm gonna be out in a few days,
and then l'm gonna call you, okay?

1093
01:41:34,800 --> 01:41:36,893
You know how she's
always saying she's a model?

1094
01:41:37,002 --> 01:41:39,095
Oh, my sweet Jesus!

1095
01:41:39,204 --> 01:41:40,865
ls that her?

1096
01:41:41,940 --> 01:41:43,999
l wonder if she's been folding
the same pair of jeans...

1097
01:41:44,076 --> 01:41:46,544
for the last five minutes?

1098
01:41:48,814 --> 01:41:50,748
And that's another thing.

1099
01:41:50,816 --> 01:41:53,250
You don't want to work
in a place like that.

1100
01:41:53,318 --> 01:41:55,786
Ugly, ugly place.

1101
01:41:55,888 --> 01:41:57,753
Ugly people.

1102
01:41:57,823 --> 01:42:00,223
Mom, listen.
This is the good part.

1103
01:42:00,325 --> 01:42:02,190
This is good.

1104
01:42:02,294 --> 01:42:05,786
Everything's gonna be
really good from now on, okay?

1105
01:42:13,005 --> 01:42:14,996
Look at this.
Look at your skin.

1106
01:42:15,974 --> 01:42:17,339
Mom.

1107
01:42:17,609 --> 01:42:19,270
What? lt's just acne.

1108
01:42:19,344 --> 01:42:21,278
lt's okay. lt'll go away.

1109
01:42:21,346 --> 01:42:24,110
lt's the drugs.
They're coming out of my system.

1110
01:42:24,216 --> 01:42:26,548
l'm gonna look really good.

1111
01:42:26,618 --> 01:42:28,779
And by Christmas,
l'm gonna look great.

1112
01:42:28,887 --> 01:42:32,118
And we are gonna have
the best holiday ever.

1113
01:42:33,058 --> 01:42:34,889
Why don't you come home?

1114
01:42:34,993 --> 01:42:37,962
Move back in with me.
Would you like that?

1115
01:42:44,403 --> 01:42:46,337
l gotta be alone.

1116
01:42:48,140 --> 01:42:51,871
But can you lend me a few bucks
for coffee and toothpaste?

1117
01:42:51,977 --> 01:42:53,342
Oh, the coffee!

1118
01:42:53,612 --> 01:42:56,137
l'm sorry. l forgot.

1119
01:42:57,216 --> 01:43:01,312
With the money you made, you could have
lived the rest of your life.

1120
01:43:02,387 --> 01:43:04,787
Well, that's what happens,
l suppose.

1121
01:43:08,193 --> 01:43:10,821
- What?
- l'm just feeling dizzy.

1122
01:43:10,896 --> 01:43:12,193
- What is it?
- Mom.

1123
01:43:16,235 --> 01:43:19,170
Oh, honey, you're burning up.

1124
01:43:20,839 --> 01:43:23,774
- Why do my ears hurt?
- Oh, baby.

1125
01:43:27,646 --> 01:43:29,170
Oh, my God.

1126
01:43:38,857 --> 01:43:40,222
You have pneumonia...

1127
01:43:40,325 --> 01:43:42,122
which we can treat.

1128
01:43:44,096 --> 01:43:45,757
Gia, listen.

1129
01:43:46,932 --> 01:43:50,993
There's something more serious
going on which caused your infection.

1130
01:43:52,070 --> 01:43:56,006
Something they're calling
Acquired lmmune Deficiency Syndrome.

1131
01:43:57,109 --> 01:43:59,043
Maybe you heard about it?

1132
01:44:01,113 --> 01:44:02,978
How did l get it?

1133
01:44:03,081 --> 01:44:05,208
Well, we're really
just finding things out...

1134
01:44:05,317 --> 01:44:07,842
and you're the first woman
l've known about.

1135
01:44:07,953 --> 01:44:11,354
Although, intravenous drug users seem
oto be in a specially high-risk group.

1136
01:44:11,456 --> 01:44:14,391
So you probably got it
from a contaminated needle.

1137
01:44:16,128 --> 01:44:18,062
How do l get rid of it?

1138
01:44:38,317 --> 01:44:40,911
But how do they know?
They don't know anything about it.

1139
01:44:41,019 --> 01:44:43,010
They know, okay?

1140
01:44:43,121 --> 01:44:45,021
They just know.

1141
01:45:41,513 --> 01:45:44,004
You know what l think?

1142
01:45:44,116 --> 01:45:47,415
l think there's a reason
for everything.

1143
01:45:47,519 --> 01:45:51,216
And l think that there's
a plan for everybody.

1144
01:45:52,958 --> 01:45:55,825
And l think that God...

1145
01:45:55,894 --> 01:45:58,829
has a big plan for me.

1146
01:45:59,931 --> 01:46:02,058
Just not in this life.

1147
01:46:05,370 --> 01:46:07,838
l'm on top of everything.

1148
01:46:07,906 --> 01:46:09,840
l'm super cool.

1149
01:46:12,043 --> 01:46:14,102
Ah, you've gotten better.

1150
01:46:19,951 --> 01:46:21,441
l can't take her home.

1151
01:46:22,387 --> 01:46:25,447
l'm trying, but Henry
is just afraid.

1152
01:46:26,358 --> 01:46:28,292
So what?

1153
01:46:28,393 --> 01:46:30,088
Dr. Blair--

1154
01:46:30,195 --> 01:46:32,993
This is your daughter.
Your daughter.

1155
01:46:33,064 --> 01:46:35,862
So people are scared.
l am scared.

1156
01:46:35,967 --> 01:46:39,300
He's afraid that if people find out,
he could lose his job.

1157
01:46:42,908 --> 01:46:44,842
Fine. Okay, fine.

1158
01:46:48,113 --> 01:46:50,138
And where is she going to go?

1159
01:46:50,248 --> 01:46:54,150
He wants her to go to a hotel.
He says that he'll pay for it.

1160
01:46:56,221 --> 01:46:58,121
Oh, God, listen to me.

1161
01:47:05,030 --> 01:47:06,930
Dr. Bruce, telephone, please.

1162
01:47:19,211 --> 01:47:21,441
What about her father?
Why can't he take her?

1163
01:47:21,546 --> 01:47:23,878
She doesn't want him to know.

1164
01:47:26,551 --> 01:47:29,111
l don't want to lose my baby.

1165
01:47:34,092 --> 01:47:36,959
- Kathleen--
- No, l can't.

1166
01:47:48,139 --> 01:47:49,663
Well...

1167
01:47:49,941 --> 01:47:51,875
you have to understand.

1168
01:47:51,977 --> 01:47:53,911
ln those days...

1169
01:47:55,514 --> 01:47:57,209
nobody knew.

1170
01:48:04,923 --> 01:48:06,652
People were scared.

1171
01:48:06,925 --> 01:48:08,654
l was scared.

1172
01:48:11,363 --> 01:48:13,957
She must have been scared too.

1173
01:48:27,212 --> 01:48:31,046
Dear Linda,
this is the end of my book.

1174
01:48:31,116 --> 01:48:34,085
The last page, the last shot.

1175
01:48:34,185 --> 01:48:36,676
Seeing you to say hello
and good-bye.

1176
01:48:37,489 --> 01:48:40,117
Seeing you to fill up
all the empty...

1177
01:48:40,225 --> 01:48:42,955
and smell and touch...

1178
01:48:43,061 --> 01:48:45,086
and leave my kisses
all over your face.

1179
01:48:50,402 --> 01:48:52,996
- That's me.
- Come in.

1180
01:48:59,311 --> 01:49:01,245
Do you want some tea?

1181
01:49:02,180 --> 01:49:05,445
l was so nervous
about seeing you.

1182
01:49:05,517 --> 01:49:07,451
Coffee?

1183
01:49:07,519 --> 01:49:09,646
No, l can't stay long.

1184
01:49:10,755 --> 01:49:11,983
Why not?

1185
01:49:15,327 --> 01:49:17,124
l have an appointment.

1186
01:49:18,363 --> 01:49:20,058
Work?

1187
01:49:21,700 --> 01:49:23,463
No more work for me.

1188
01:49:25,170 --> 01:49:27,661
l just thought
we'd have more time.

1189
01:49:27,772 --> 01:49:29,763
Yeah, me too.

1190
01:49:30,041 --> 01:49:31,406
Just not today.

1191
01:49:31,476 --> 01:49:33,273
That's okay.

1192
01:49:33,378 --> 01:49:36,745
We have all the time in the world.
We'll take it.

1193
01:49:38,083 --> 01:49:39,448
Yeah, l guess so.

1194
01:49:41,353 --> 01:49:44,379
But today l just wanted
to see your face.

1195
01:49:44,489 --> 01:49:46,150
l missed your face.

1196
01:50:00,205 --> 01:50:02,139
What are you going to do?

1197
01:50:05,243 --> 01:50:07,711
l don't know. l have some plans.
l think...

1198
01:50:07,812 --> 01:50:10,144
l might go to school, you know?

1199
01:50:10,215 --> 01:50:12,342
Learn something useful maybe.

1200
01:50:14,252 --> 01:50:17,380
Maybe even settle down
and have some kids, you know?

1201
01:50:17,489 --> 01:50:19,184
What the hell?

1202
01:50:19,257 --> 01:50:20,747
Wow.

1203
01:50:21,559 --> 01:50:24,027
How straight are you now?

1204
01:50:24,129 --> 01:50:27,064
l mean, are we
talking about men?

1205
01:50:28,299 --> 01:50:30,233
You don't need a husband
to have kids.

1206
01:50:33,471 --> 01:50:37,805
And besides, you were the one
who always had my heart, you know?

1207
01:50:42,847 --> 01:50:46,442
Yeah, l guess l did know that.

1208
01:50:52,290 --> 01:50:54,315
Would you keep these for me?

1209
01:50:56,795 --> 01:50:58,660
Your fairy tales?

1210
01:50:58,763 --> 01:51:00,788
Yeah, some. A few.

1211
01:51:02,133 --> 01:51:05,068
Plus all the other
crazy shit in my head.

1212
01:51:06,538 --> 01:51:10,736
l don't want to throw it away.
l just don't want it around right now.

1213
01:51:12,210 --> 01:51:15,179
- You can read it if you want.
- No, l won't.

1214
01:51:15,280 --> 01:51:19,216
No, read it.
l want you to, you know?

1215
01:51:19,317 --> 01:51:21,717
Maybe you can make
some sense out of it.

1216
01:51:21,786 --> 01:51:23,447
l never could.

1217
01:51:29,294 --> 01:51:32,730
- l'm gonna see you again, aren't l?
- Yeah, you want to?

1218
01:51:42,707 --> 01:51:47,406
You know, l was thinking about...

1219
01:51:48,513 --> 01:51:51,641
getting a house at the beach
this summer.

1220
01:51:51,750 --> 01:51:53,115
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1221
01:51:53,218 --> 01:51:56,676
l really thought that
it would give us a chance.

1222
01:51:58,256 --> 01:52:01,851
l would like so much for us
to have another chance.

1223
01:52:04,829 --> 01:52:06,763
Yeah, l'd like that too.

1224
01:52:12,170 --> 01:52:13,501
l gotta go.

1225
01:52:13,738 --> 01:52:16,400
No, wait.
l want you to stay.

1226
01:52:28,953 --> 01:52:33,219
You were the one.
You were the only one.

1227
01:52:33,291 --> 01:52:36,260
And you are amazing.

1228
01:52:49,874 --> 01:52:51,637
She--

1229
01:52:51,743 --> 01:52:54,735
She put together this money.

1230
01:52:55,814 --> 01:52:57,805
She pawned some things...

1231
01:52:57,916 --> 01:53:00,316
borrowed some from her father...

1232
01:53:01,386 --> 01:53:03,980
stole some from Kathleen.

1233
01:53:06,891 --> 01:53:10,884
l didn't know
what she was doing.

1234
01:53:10,962 --> 01:53:12,930
l should have...

1235
01:53:13,031 --> 01:53:14,692
but l didn't.

1236
01:53:14,799 --> 01:53:17,700
lt may have crossed my mind.

1237
01:53:19,270 --> 01:53:21,204
l really didn't think
she would do that.

1238
01:53:23,741 --> 01:53:25,834
l really didn't.

1239
01:53:28,580 --> 01:53:31,242
Yo, Gia. How you doing?

1240
01:53:31,349 --> 01:53:32,873
Good. ls he here?

1241
01:53:32,984 --> 01:53:34,815
Yeah, he's in the back.

1242
01:53:40,758 --> 01:53:42,851
How much you want, angel?

1243
01:53:42,927 --> 01:53:45,259
As much as you've got.

1244
01:53:48,266 --> 01:53:51,326
What are you gonna do
with that much stuff?

1245
01:53:52,437 --> 01:53:54,701
Well, that's my business.

1246
01:53:59,310 --> 01:54:02,438
- What, are you holding or not?
- What's your hurry?

1247
01:54:03,448 --> 01:54:05,382
All right. Come on.
Yes or no?

1248
01:54:06,784 --> 01:54:09,309
Yeah, l got what you need...

1249
01:54:09,387 --> 01:54:11,321
and l got it right here.

1250
01:54:12,056 --> 01:54:14,354
Yo, man, what the fuck
are you doing?

1251
01:54:14,425 --> 01:54:17,451
- Look what Santa Claus brought us.
- l'm freaking out of here!

1252
01:54:17,562 --> 01:54:19,928
You get the money.
l'm gonna get mine.

1253
01:54:39,751 --> 01:54:41,651
lt's gonna be all right.

1254
01:55:03,841 --> 01:55:05,775
What are you doing here?

1255
01:55:22,493 --> 01:55:25,326
l'm gonna take you home, baby.

1256
01:55:31,069 --> 01:55:33,765
She wouldn't let anybody see her...

1257
01:55:33,871 --> 01:55:36,032
but l went anyway.

1258
01:55:36,140 --> 01:55:38,472
l saw her once.

1259
01:55:39,577 --> 01:55:41,477
But l did see her.

1260
01:55:41,579 --> 01:55:45,481
- l don't think she knew it was me.
- No more than five minutes, okay?

1261
01:55:47,018 --> 01:55:51,478
l couldn't help thinking to myself,
''My God, she's just a kid.''

1262
01:55:52,557 --> 01:55:54,923
l blame myself, you know?

1263
01:55:56,160 --> 01:55:59,061
l mean, these are children.

1264
01:56:00,531 --> 01:56:03,125
No matter how screwed up
our lives may be...

1265
01:56:03,401 --> 01:56:06,165
we've got to take care
of our children.

1266
01:56:19,517 --> 01:56:21,576
She knew she was dying.

1267
01:56:21,819 --> 01:56:24,117
She said she wanted
to do it right.

1268
01:56:24,222 --> 01:56:26,850
She wanted
to get a video camera...

1269
01:56:26,958 --> 01:56:28,983
and do this thing...

1270
01:56:29,093 --> 01:56:31,926
where she talked to kids
about drugs.

1271
01:56:32,897 --> 01:56:34,831
She wanted to tell kids...

1272
01:56:35,833 --> 01:56:37,960
that you can handle it.

1273
01:56:39,737 --> 01:56:41,898
You can handle anything
that comes your way.

1274
01:56:44,475 --> 01:56:46,773
But we never got the camera.

1275
01:56:56,921 --> 01:57:01,085
You do be the prettiest,
prettiest girl.

1276
01:57:02,193 --> 01:57:04,127
You do be that.

1277
01:57:05,029 --> 01:57:06,553
Do l?

1278
01:57:07,465 --> 01:57:10,901
Do l be the prettiest?

1279
01:57:26,284 --> 01:57:28,514
Do you forgive me, Kathleen?

1280
01:57:32,123 --> 01:57:33,750
Oh, honey.

1281
01:57:35,760 --> 01:57:36,954
Oh, yeah.

1282
01:57:42,166 --> 01:57:43,827
Of course l do.

1283
01:57:49,574 --> 01:57:52,008
Because l forgive you too.

1284
01:57:56,280 --> 01:57:57,975
Oh, baby.

1285
01:58:08,292 --> 01:58:09,953
What's this?

1286
01:58:15,233 --> 01:58:17,098
What is it?

1287
01:58:17,168 --> 01:58:19,033
Oh, my God.

1288
01:58:21,973 --> 01:58:23,770
Nurse?

1289
01:58:23,841 --> 01:58:25,900
Where are you going, Mom?

1290
01:58:27,311 --> 01:58:28,972
Mom?

1291
01:58:30,114 --> 01:58:32,014
Where you going?

1292
01:58:38,556 --> 01:58:41,525
She died around
10:00 in the morning.

1293
01:58:41,759 --> 01:58:44,057
They tried to pick her--

1294
01:58:44,162 --> 01:58:47,097
They tried to pick her
up off the bed, and she--

1295
01:58:47,165 --> 01:58:49,929
The flesh just fell off her back.
lt just fell off.

1296
01:58:51,035 --> 01:58:52,969
You don't want
to hear about that.

1297
01:58:55,239 --> 01:58:57,173
Okay, what else?

1298
01:59:06,017 --> 01:59:09,043
This is it.
This is what l was looking for.

1299
01:59:10,955 --> 01:59:13,321
''And the people said...

1300
01:59:13,591 --> 01:59:16,219
'Oh, she's not beautiful at all.'

1301
01:59:16,327 --> 01:59:18,591
And they took her from
the beautiful house...

1302
01:59:18,829 --> 01:59:21,354
and they drove her
into the street.

1303
01:59:21,632 --> 01:59:24,100
And she went away...

1304
01:59:24,202 --> 01:59:26,295
and she never came back.

1305
01:59:29,373 --> 01:59:31,864
And soon,
people became hungry again...

1306
01:59:31,976 --> 01:59:34,342
and they went back into
the beautiful house...

1307
01:59:34,745 --> 01:59:38,340
looking for gold,
but there was no one there.''

1308
01:59:40,218 --> 01:59:41,981
They say she knew.

1309
01:59:42,086 --> 01:59:44,384
She really knew.
She knew the whole story.

1310
01:59:47,858 --> 01:59:50,793
We found an undertaker,
and it was hard, believe me.

1311
01:59:50,895 --> 01:59:53,989
You know, because of the AlDS.

1312
01:59:54,098 --> 01:59:57,068
l didn't want people
to remember her like that...

1313
01:59:57,068 --> 01:59:58,968
because l didn't want people
to see her like that.

1314
01:59:59,070 --> 02:00:02,836
l wanted them to remember her
as beautiful...

1315
02:00:02,907 --> 02:00:05,842
because that's what
she really was.

1316
02:00:45,783 --> 02:00:48,047
Life and death...

1317
02:00:48,119 --> 02:00:50,849
energy and peace.

1318
02:00:50,955 --> 02:00:53,947
lf l stop today,
it was still worth it.

1319
02:00:54,058 --> 02:00:56,720
Even the terrible mistakes
that l have made...

1320
02:00:56,827 --> 02:00:59,193
and would have unmade
if l could.

1321
02:00:59,297 --> 02:01:02,824
The pains that have burned me
and scarred my soul.

1322
02:01:02,933 --> 02:01:04,264
lt was worth it...

1323
02:01:04,368 --> 02:01:07,269
for having been allowed
to walk where l've walked...

1324
02:01:07,371 --> 02:01:09,362
which was to hell on Earth...

1325
02:01:09,473 --> 02:01:11,338
heaven on Earth...

1326
02:01:11,409 --> 02:01:14,242
back again, into, under...

1327
02:01:14,312 --> 02:01:17,145
far in between, through it...

1328
02:01:17,248 --> 02:01:19,375
in it and above.
