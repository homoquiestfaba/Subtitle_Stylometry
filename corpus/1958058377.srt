I'm calling from Paris.

27
00:01:20,102 --> 00:01:21,542
Paris.

28
00:01:21,543 --> 00:01:23,914
Paris, Mr. Weatherbee.

29
00:01:23,915 --> 00:01:26,167
You know the one in France?

30
00:01:26,168 --> 00:01:27,882
France, Mr. Weatherbee.

31
00:01:29,291 --> 00:01:30,971
It doesn't matter where I am.

32
00:01:30,972 --> 00:01:33,524
I'm calling about the reunion.

33
00:01:33,525 --> 00:01:35,180
Will Archie be there?

34
00:01:36,468 --> 00:01:38,092
Archie Andrews.

35
00:01:39,441 --> 00:01:40,588
Of course, I'll hold.

36
00:01:40,589 --> 00:01:42,203
(bell ringing)

37
00:01:42,204 --> 00:01:45,296
- Well, that's the last bell
we'll hear for two months.

38
00:01:45,297 --> 00:01:47,192
Everyone have a wonderful summer.

39
00:01:48,833 --> 00:01:50,611
Gonna miss you.

40
00:01:50,612 --> 00:01:51,613
Play hard.

41
00:01:54,095 --> 00:01:55,870
Try and remember Ms. Cooper.

42
00:02:02,053 --> 00:02:03,374
- [Robert] Hey.

43
00:02:03,375 --> 00:02:04,755
- Honey, you're early.

44
00:02:04,756 --> 00:02:07,128
- Okay, the gas tank is
full, suitcases are packed,

45
00:02:07,129 --> 00:02:07,962
and if you'll drive,

46
00:02:07,963 --> 00:02:09,890
I'll get all my paperwork outta the way.

47
00:02:09,891 --> 00:02:10,872
Well, almost all of it.

48
00:02:10,873 --> 00:02:14,064
- I can't wait for you to meet everyone.

49
00:02:14,065 --> 00:02:15,150
- Especially Archie.

50
00:02:16,047 --> 00:02:21,052
I know it's insecure, but I
just don't like old boyfriends.

51
00:02:21,062 --> 00:02:23,043
- Well, Archie's not an old boyfriend.

52
00:02:23,044 --> 00:02:24,045
He's,

53
00:02:26,588 --> 00:02:27,912
it's hard to explain.

54
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:30,311
- He is?

55
00:02:30,312 --> 00:02:31,752
Wonderful.

56
00:02:31,753 --> 00:02:33,077
Thank you, Mr. Weatherbee.

57
00:02:35,387 --> 00:02:38,299
Smithers, were you ever tempted

58
00:02:38,300 --> 00:02:40,491
to go back to your first love?

59
00:02:40,492 --> 00:02:43,404
- No, madame, but only
because I married her.

60
00:02:43,405 --> 00:02:45,006
- Most of us weren't that smart.

61
00:02:45,927 --> 00:02:47,975
Book me on the first Concord to Riverdale.

62
00:02:47,976 --> 00:02:52,923
- I don't believe the Concord
flies to Riverdale, madame.

63
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:54,976
- We'll have to talk to Daddy about that.

64
00:02:55,837 --> 00:02:57,229
- Yes, madame.

65
00:03:03,848 --> 00:03:04,849
- I love it.

66
00:03:06,798 --> 00:03:08,483
- New job, new look.

67
00:03:09,621 --> 00:03:11,422
Oh, don't wear it to the reunion, hun.

68
00:03:11,423 --> 00:03:13,194
Save it for Monday.

69
00:03:13,195 --> 00:03:14,692
You ready for city life?

70
00:03:14,693 --> 00:03:17,668
- (sighs) Four long days
and one little trial,

71
00:03:17,669 --> 00:03:19,410
then it's goodbye Riverdale,

72
00:03:19,411 --> 00:03:22,773
hello, two bedroom, two
bath with park view.

73
00:03:22,774 --> 00:03:23,705
Can't wait.

74
00:03:23,706 --> 00:03:25,686
- I categorize the boxes for you.

75
00:03:25,687 --> 00:03:27,067
Green stickers get moved,

76
00:03:27,068 --> 00:03:30,004
and orange stickers goes
straight to the Salvation Army.

77
00:03:30,005 --> 00:03:30,839
- Okay.
- Bye.

78
00:03:30,839 --> 00:03:31,673
- Bye.

79
00:03:31,673 --> 00:03:32,674
Thanks.

80
00:03:34,841 --> 00:03:38,966
(door clicks)
(dog barking)

81
00:03:38,967 --> 00:03:42,233
Honey, honey, my varsity jacket.

82
00:03:42,234 --> 00:03:45,115
No, I, I, I love this jacket.

83
00:03:45,116 --> 00:03:46,227
And my mother's toaster.

84
00:03:46,228 --> 00:03:47,698
No, look, look, Pam, Pam,

85
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:50,040
we, we gotta keep this,
this is a collector's item.

86
00:03:50,041 --> 00:03:51,692
- It started a fire.

87
00:03:51,693 --> 00:03:53,103
- A small fire.

88
00:03:53,104 --> 00:03:55,055
And all my belts.

89
00:03:55,056 --> 00:03:56,737
Gee, can't we just
throw out the ugly ones?

90
00:03:56,738 --> 00:03:59,290
- Belts are utilitarian,
suspenders are statement,

91
00:03:59,291 --> 00:04:02,142
everyone at Gibson Cratchit
Law wears suspenders.

92
00:04:02,143 --> 00:04:03,144
- You don't.

93
00:04:06,089 --> 00:04:08,592
(Pam giggles)

94
00:04:10,011 --> 00:04:14,005
Look, soon dum, dum, dum.

95
00:04:20,890 --> 00:04:21,789
(children laughing)

96
00:04:21,789 --> 00:04:22,623
(car door clicks)

97
00:04:22,624 --> 00:04:25,175
You sure you don't wanna
stay for the reunion?

98
00:04:25,176 --> 00:04:26,674
- It's you they wanna see.

99
00:04:26,675 --> 00:04:29,173
I'd just in there nodding and smiling.

100
00:04:30,191 --> 00:04:32,593
You wanna know what I found
out at my high school reunion?

101
00:04:32,594 --> 00:04:33,428
- What?

102
00:04:33,429 --> 00:04:35,089
- Absolutely nothing.

103
00:04:36,232 --> 00:04:39,771
I'll keep the apartment warm for you.

104
00:04:39,772 --> 00:04:40,606
(car door bangs)

105
00:04:40,607 --> 00:04:41,692
- I'll miss you.

106
00:04:41,693 --> 00:04:43,184
Till Monday.

107
00:04:43,185 --> 00:04:44,679
- And?

108
00:04:44,680 --> 00:04:45,986
- And I'll call three times a day.

109
00:04:45,987 --> 00:04:46,988
- And?

110
00:04:47,879 --> 00:04:50,130
- Gibson, Cratchit, and Andrews.

111
00:04:50,131 --> 00:04:51,486
- You just wait.

112
00:04:52,912 --> 00:04:56,597
(car engine revving)

113
00:04:56,598 --> 00:04:59,922
(car engine roaring)

114
00:04:59,923 --> 00:05:01,375
- I'm gonna keep this jacket.

115
00:05:03,495 --> 00:05:08,500
Huh, ah, oh, Moose, Moose,
now just take it easy.

116
00:05:09,351 --> 00:05:11,332
- Archie's all alignment today.

117
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,593
(bones cracking)

118
00:05:12,594 --> 00:05:15,235
He must be nervous about
seeing Betty and Veronica.

119
00:05:15,236 --> 00:05:17,728
- Not when he's got getting
married to be nervous about.

120
00:05:17,729 --> 00:05:21,422
- You know, I hate when guys
complain about getting married.

121
00:05:21,423 --> 00:05:22,256
- Me too.

122
00:05:22,257 --> 00:05:24,875
- Then they complain about being married

123
00:05:24,876 --> 00:05:27,938
and about their kids
and about their divorce.

124
00:05:27,939 --> 00:05:29,440
- [Moose] Which they could have avoided

125
00:05:29,441 --> 00:05:32,657
if they didn't complain
in the first place.

126
00:05:33,495 --> 00:05:36,587
- Well, I'm sure Veronica
barely remembers me.

127
00:05:36,588 --> 00:05:39,920
And Betty, well, Betty's
still looking for someone

128
00:05:39,921 --> 00:05:41,602
as sweet as she is.

129
00:05:41,603 --> 00:05:42,654
Of course, nobody is.

130
00:05:43,645 --> 00:05:47,337
- You know, Archie always had
a soft spot for those two.

131
00:05:47,338 --> 00:05:48,703
- I guess nothing changes.

132
00:05:48,704 --> 00:05:51,752
- (groaning) Well, that's
where you're wrong, Moose.

133
00:05:51,753 --> 00:05:54,175
See, some things do change.

134
00:05:54,176 --> 00:05:55,722
(Archie groaning)

135
00:05:55,723 --> 00:05:57,097
(bones cracking)

136
00:05:57,098 --> 00:05:58,449
- [Jughead] It's not so much the world

137
00:05:58,450 --> 00:05:59,950
that's bothering me today,

138
00:05:59,951 --> 00:06:01,962
although it's rotting as we speak.

139
00:06:01,963 --> 00:06:03,764
It's my personal life.

140
00:06:03,765 --> 00:06:06,797
Never play poker with your wife.

141
00:06:06,798 --> 00:06:10,851
- Because it could encourage
competition over communication.

142
00:06:10,852 --> 00:06:12,593
- Because she could win.

143
00:06:12,594 --> 00:06:14,779
My ex-wife beat me every time.

144
00:06:14,780 --> 00:06:15,956
It wasn't a marriage.

145
00:06:15,957 --> 00:06:19,650
No, it was a six year hand
and I was out bluffed.

146
00:06:19,651 --> 00:06:20,652
- Hmm.

147
00:06:21,543 --> 00:06:23,884
- Yeah, now she's getting remarried,

148
00:06:23,885 --> 00:06:28,689
and I get Jordan, I
love him, but he's wild.

149
00:06:28,690 --> 00:06:30,791
Lack of a strong father figure, I guess.

150
00:06:30,792 --> 00:06:32,544
Not that I missed a single weekend,

151
00:06:33,705 --> 00:06:37,071
and I know he loves me too intellectually,

152
00:06:38,269 --> 00:06:42,567
but we don't have a real relationship.

153
00:06:46,468 --> 00:06:47,759
I'm scared stiff.

154
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:48,899
(phone buzzes)

155
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:49,734
- [Secretary] Sorry, doctor.

156
00:06:49,735 --> 00:06:51,422
But there's a Mr. Weatherbee on the line

157
00:06:51,423 --> 00:06:54,394
demanding to know if someone named Jughead

158
00:06:54,395 --> 00:06:55,810
is coming to a reunion.

159
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:01,245
- Uh, tell Mr. Weatherbee I'll be there.

160
00:07:03,164 --> 00:07:05,476
Well, I'm sorry, our time's up for today.

161
00:07:05,477 --> 00:07:07,818
Oh, was there something
you wanted to discuss?

162
00:07:07,819 --> 00:07:08,653
- No, Doc.

163
00:07:08,654 --> 00:07:12,953
Hearing your problems always
makes my life seem much better.

164
00:07:12,954 --> 00:07:16,016
- Well, I didn't go to
medical school for nothing.

165
00:07:16,017 --> 00:07:17,018
Okay.

166
00:07:18,367 --> 00:07:19,203
Huh.

167
00:07:19,203 --> 00:07:20,037
(traffic humming)
(birds chirping)

168
00:07:20,038 --> 00:07:23,073
So what should we talk about?

169
00:07:23,074 --> 00:07:24,298
- [Jordan] I don't know, Dad.

170
00:07:27,459 --> 00:07:28,479
(group chattering)

171
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:32,172
- We've got to get our
interpersonal communication going.

172
00:07:32,173 --> 00:07:33,648
Pick a topic, anything.

173
00:07:34,966 --> 00:07:35,967
- I don't know, Dad.

174
00:07:38,239 --> 00:07:41,241
- Aren't there certain like,

175
00:07:41,242 --> 00:07:44,785
questions you'd like to ask me maybe?

176
00:07:44,786 --> 00:07:46,437
And don't say, I don't know, Dad.

177
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:50,761
- What you holding?

178
00:07:50,762 --> 00:07:51,596
- Oh, me.

179
00:07:51,597 --> 00:07:53,437
Well, I, I've got three aces.

180
00:07:57,218 --> 00:07:58,219
- Full house.

181
00:07:59,110 --> 00:08:02,800
- Uh, uh, good, good for you.

182
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:05,230
(upbeat music)

183
00:08:05,231 --> 00:08:10,236
- Linda.

00:08:21,129 --> 00:08:22,130
Yo, Geeky.

191
00:08:23,414 --> 00:08:26,346
Pig John and I are forming a metal band.

192
00:08:26,347 --> 00:08:28,719
You better get your autograph
while they're cheap.

193
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,001
- And while we're still
giving them to geeks like you.

194
00:08:31,002 --> 00:08:34,094
- Yeah, I was in a band
before you guys even existed.

195
00:08:34,095 --> 00:08:36,106
But you do have one advantage.

196
00:08:36,107 --> 00:08:37,272
- And what's that?

197
00:08:37,273 --> 00:08:38,899
- Well, you see, we had to buy drums.

198
00:08:38,900 --> 00:08:40,611
Now you can just hit your heads

199
00:08:40,612 --> 00:08:42,412
to get that deep hollow sound.

200
00:08:42,413 --> 00:08:43,584
- Hmm.

201
00:08:43,585 --> 00:08:44,695
- You better try selling that stuff

202
00:08:44,696 --> 00:08:46,397
to somebody dumb enough to buy it.

203
00:08:49,833 --> 00:08:53,043
Oh, look at you in your suit.

204
00:08:53,044 --> 00:08:55,128
You can't wait to get out
of our little town, can you?

205
00:08:55,129 --> 00:08:56,767
- I can't wait to get out in the world.

206
00:08:56,768 --> 00:08:57,669
You know, rumor has it,

207
00:08:57,670 --> 00:08:59,890
lots of things are happening out there.

208
00:08:59,891 --> 00:09:01,061
- Archie, the only thing worth

209
00:09:01,062 --> 00:09:03,655
giving a hoot about happens in here.

210
00:09:03,656 --> 00:09:04,736
(Pop chuckling)

211
00:09:04,737 --> 00:09:07,254
- Oh, Pop.

212
00:09:07,255 --> 00:09:09,439
You know, Pops, these guys are eating you

213
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:10,581
outta house and home.

214
00:09:10,582 --> 00:09:12,593
- And you guys didn't?

215
00:09:12,594 --> 00:09:13,674
What's good for the kids-

216
00:09:13,675 --> 00:09:15,226
- Is good for Pops.

217
00:09:15,227 --> 00:09:18,480

218
00:09:23,702 --> 00:09:26,166
(plane engine roaring)

219
00:09:26,167 --> 00:09:28,192
It's the Concord.

220
00:09:28,193 --> 00:09:30,460
- (chuckles) Archie Andrews.

221
00:09:30,461 --> 00:09:33,013
You may think you're all wise
in the ways of the world,

222
00:09:33,014 --> 00:09:36,557
but everyone knows the Concord
doesn't fly to Riverdale.

223
00:09:36,558 --> 00:09:38,317
(Pop laughs)

224
00:09:38,318 --> 00:09:40,745
(traffic humming)
(car door bangs)

225
00:09:40,746 --> 00:09:44,277
- [Man] Yeah, I read that
in the paper actually.

226
00:09:44,278 --> 00:09:45,663
(birds chirping)

227
00:09:45,664 --> 00:09:47,985
(door clicks)
(bell ringing)

228
00:09:47,986 --> 00:09:52,052
- Hey, Arch, did I see you
in a Beamer the other day?

229
00:09:52,053 --> 00:09:54,248
- Yeah, my, my fiances.

230
00:09:55,088 --> 00:09:56,737
- Oh, I should have know.

231
00:09:56,738 --> 00:09:58,749
Hey, why don't you come on down
to Downtown Reggie's Motors?

232
00:09:58,750 --> 00:10:00,641
I'll fix you up in something flashy.

233
00:10:00,642 --> 00:10:03,437
You'll be making some bucks soon.

234
00:10:04,275 --> 00:10:05,836
Hey, I'll even finance you.

235
00:10:05,837 --> 00:10:07,487
- At 20%.

236
00:10:07,488 --> 00:10:10,070
- Hey, only a fool
gives money away, right?

237
00:10:10,071 --> 00:10:12,229
- Well, you're the one who'd
know about that, Reggie.

238
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,896
- (chuckles) You betcha.

239
00:10:13,897 --> 00:10:16,733
(Reggie chuckles)

240
00:10:17,939 --> 00:10:20,792
- Archie, uh, Reggie and I
have some business to discuss.

241
00:10:22,515 --> 00:10:23,739
(bell ringing)
(door clicks)

242

(upbeat music)

245
00:10:31,166 --> 00:10:32,334
- Hey, Archie.

246
00:10:34,769 --> 00:10:35,602
(girl laughing)

247
00:10:35,603 --> 00:10:37,890
- Hold on.
- Yeah.

248
00:10:37,891 --> 00:10:40,393
(girl grunts)

249
00:10:43,536 --> 00:10:44,739
(girl laughing)

250
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:46,909
- Hold on, hold on.
- Yeah.

251
00:10:47,888 --> 00:10:49,109
(brooding music)

252
00:10:49,110 --> 00:10:51,962
- It's been some time since we spoke.

253
00:10:51,963 --> 00:10:52,964
- Miss me?

254
00:10:53,705 --> 00:10:56,410
- I find even the
slightest contact painful.

255
00:10:57,415 --> 00:10:58,467
(car engine roaring)

256
00:10:58,468 --> 00:11:00,851
(metal thuds)
(horn honking)

257
00:11:00,852 --> 00:11:02,352
My sixth driver this year.

258
00:11:02,353 --> 00:11:04,424
As our country decays
it becomes ever harder

259
00:11:04,425 --> 00:11:05,806
to find good help.

260
00:11:05,807 --> 00:11:07,908
- Yeah. I, I, I guess
they just don't realize

261
00:11:07,909 --> 00:11:10,731
how lucky they are to be
working for a man like you.

262
00:11:10,732 --> 00:11:13,523
- Are a mosquito, Archie,

263
00:11:13,524 --> 00:11:17,337
inconsequential, but capable
of a low, annoying buzz.

264
00:11:17,338 --> 00:11:19,319
You're a lightweight, a sim, a piece of-

265
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:20,490
- Well-

266
00:11:20,491 --> 00:11:21,726
- White bread.

267
00:11:25,296 --> 00:11:28,779
In the past, you were
unable to pollute Veronica

268
00:11:28,780 --> 00:11:30,310
with your mediocrity.

269
00:11:30,311 --> 00:11:31,763
I intend to keep it that way.

270
00:11:32,834 --> 00:11:36,676
You will see her only as
necessitated by reunion functions.

271
00:11:36,677 --> 00:11:38,538
You will not attempt to pursue her,

272
00:11:38,539 --> 00:11:40,163
to foist your charms on her.

273
00:11:40,164 --> 00:11:42,082
- Hey, hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.

274
00:11:42,083 --> 00:11:44,154
Look, I'm engaged.

275
00:11:44,155 --> 00:11:46,676
Veronica's an old friend, I'm
looking forward to seeing her

276
00:11:46,677 --> 00:11:48,088
and that's it.

277
00:11:48,089 --> 00:11:50,406
Not that it's any of your business.

278
00:11:50,407 --> 00:11:52,052
(brakes squeaking)

279
00:11:52,053 --> 00:11:56,470
- Everything in Riverdale is my business.

280
00:11:58,138 --> 00:12:01,002
- Well, I'm glad we had this little chat.

281
00:12:03,633 --> 00:12:04,867
(car door clicks)
(birds chirping)

282
00:12:04,868 --> 00:12:06,787
(dog barking)

283
00:12:06,788 --> 00:12:11,200
(limo engine roaring)
(tires screeching)

284
00:12:11,201 --> 00:12:12,511
- Okay, Dad.

285
00:12:12,512 --> 00:12:13,680
- What a town.

286
00:12:15,726 --> 00:12:16,623
(ball thuds)

287
00:12:16,624 --> 00:12:20,210
(slow tempo playful music)

288
00:12:38,666 --> 00:12:43,671
(door clicks)
(dog barking)

289
00:12:51,783 --> 00:12:52,784
Hey.

290
00:12:53,945 --> 00:12:55,296
How'd you get in here, kid?

291
00:12:56,262 --> 00:12:57,096
(gun whirring)

292
00:12:57,096 --> 00:12:58,059
(Archie gasps)

293
00:12:58,060 --> 00:12:59,076
Why you.

294
00:12:59,077 --> 00:13:00,112
(playful music)

295
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:00,947
You little.

296
00:13:00,948 --> 00:13:02,790
Come here, you little hoodlum.

297
00:13:02,791 --> 00:13:04,995
Oh, oh, if I get my hands on you.

298
00:13:04,996 --> 00:13:05,997
Whoa.

299
00:13:06,697 --> 00:13:07,698
- Hey.

300
00:13:09,351 --> 00:13:11,678
(Archie grunting)

301
00:13:11,679 --> 00:13:12,513
- I got you now.

302
00:13:12,514 --> 00:13:14,408
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

303
00:13:14,409 --> 00:13:15,243
(Archie groans)

304
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:16,557
(body thuds)
(playful music)

305
00:13:16,558 --> 00:13:21,563
(Jordan chuckles)
(Archie groans)

306
00:13:23,450 --> 00:13:24,454
(upbeat music)

307
00:13:24,455 --> 00:13:26,004
- Arch.

308
00:13:26,005 --> 00:13:27,734
- Jughead.

309
00:13:27,735 --> 00:13:29,332
- Jughead?

310
00:13:29,333 --> 00:13:32,781
(Archie chuckling)

311
00:13:32,782 --> 00:13:33,616
(Jughead laughing)

312
00:13:33,616 --> 00:13:34,617
- Come here you.

313
00:13:35,679 --> 00:13:37,307
How are you?

314
00:13:37,308 --> 00:13:39,229
- Say hello to your Uncle Archie.

315
00:13:39,230 --> 00:13:40,700
- He's not my uncle.

316
00:13:40,701 --> 00:13:43,613
- Oh, that's okay, just call me Archie.

317
00:13:43,614 --> 00:13:44,939
- Super dumb name.

318
00:13:46,167 --> 00:13:47,641
- Yeah, maybe.

319
00:13:48,599 --> 00:13:53,013
But it's not half as dumb as Jughead Jr.

320
00:13:53,014 --> 00:13:56,017
- You call me that again and
something really bad'll happen.

321
00:13:58,864 --> 00:13:59,950
- Whew.

322
00:13:59,951 --> 00:14:01,252
- Takes after his mom huh?

323
00:14:03,945 --> 00:14:06,076
I tried to keep in touch.

324
00:14:06,077 --> 00:14:07,491
- Yeah, me too.

325
00:14:09,110 --> 00:14:10,111
- So, uh,

326
00:14:13,044 --> 00:14:14,045
how are you?

327
00:14:15,686 --> 00:14:19,259
- Well, I'm not great at all.

328
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:20,580
I'm horrible, Arch.

329
00:14:20,581 --> 00:14:22,339
I'm really lonely.

330
00:14:22,340 --> 00:14:24,304
- (chuckles) I'm sure
that's just temporary.

331
00:14:24,305 --> 00:14:25,325
- And I'm phobic.

332
00:14:25,326 --> 00:14:28,808
I can't look at a woman
without seeing my ex-wife.

333
00:14:28,809 --> 00:14:29,917
- You'll get over that.

334
00:14:29,918 --> 00:14:32,292
- And I'm a stranger to my
own son, who's actually,

335
00:14:32,293 --> 00:14:34,574
he's not a bad kid as long
as you don't mind living

336
00:14:34,575 --> 00:14:37,278
through the really violent
outtakes of "The Exorcist".

337
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:40,287
- You look good.

338
00:14:40,288 --> 00:14:42,790
(door clicks)

339
00:14:44,312 --> 00:14:46,731
(door bangs)

340
00:15:01,662 --> 00:15:03,373
Veronica is kicking off the weekend

341
00:15:03,374 --> 00:15:05,775
with a luncheon tea
for all of her friends.

342
00:15:05,776 --> 00:15:07,968
- You never drank tea in high school?

343
00:15:07,969 --> 00:15:10,014
- I never drank anything in high school.

344
00:15:13,584 --> 00:15:16,620
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
don't plug that toaster in.

345
00:15:17,608 --> 00:15:18,868
- Why?

346
00:15:18,869 --> 00:15:19,860
- I'll handle this.

347
00:15:19,861 --> 00:15:23,284
Jordan, do not plug in that toaster.

348
00:15:23,285 --> 00:15:24,238
(Archie grunts)

349
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:26,362
(electricity hissing)
(Archie yelling)

350
00:15:26,363 --> 00:15:28,658
(birds chirping)

351
00:15:28,659 --> 00:15:31,721
I'm sure the burn marks
will wash off the ceiling.

352
00:15:31,722 --> 00:15:33,107
- No problem.

353
00:15:34,875 --> 00:15:37,097
- Think maybe you should
put on another tie.

354
00:15:37,098 --> 00:15:39,443
- Everything's packed.

355
00:15:41,512 --> 00:15:44,154
- You know, there might
be just enough material

356
00:15:44,155 --> 00:15:45,239
to make a bow tie.

357
00:15:46,516 --> 00:15:47,517
- A?

358
00:15:51,663 --> 00:15:54,499
(classical music)

359
00:15:55,403 --> 00:15:57,217
- Make sure there's a flower
arrange man on each table.

360
00:15:57,218 --> 00:15:58,448
Keep the champagne fountain full.

361
00:15:58,449 --> 00:15:59,559
Do you have enough ice?

362
00:15:59,560 --> 00:16:00,905
Great.

363
00:16:00,906 --> 00:16:02,791
(Veronica sighs)

364
00:16:02,792 --> 00:16:04,965
(Veronica gasps)

365
00:16:04,966 --> 00:16:06,019
Hi!

366
00:16:06,020 --> 00:16:08,689
(both laughing)

367
00:16:10,071 --> 00:16:12,712
Look what you did with your hair.

368
00:16:12,713 --> 00:16:14,008
- I cut it myself.

369
00:16:15,536 --> 00:16:17,998
- Don't tell me you made that dress.

370
00:16:17,999 --> 00:16:21,271
- Oh, this is just
something I got on sale.

371
00:16:21,272 --> 00:16:22,832
Where did you get yours?

372
00:16:22,833 --> 00:16:25,745
- Oh, Armani, Versace.

373
00:16:25,746 --> 00:16:27,098
I mean, who can keep track?

374
00:16:30,145 --> 00:16:33,448
- [Man] You're looking forward to it.

375
00:16:33,449 --> 00:16:34,907
(car door clicks)

376
00:16:34,908 --> 00:16:35,909
- Coming?

377
00:16:36,917 --> 00:16:37,918
Jughead.

378
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,760
- He gets like this.

379
00:16:40,761 --> 00:16:42,832
Dad, car's on fire.

380
00:16:42,833 --> 00:16:44,338
You'll be burned to a crisp.

381
00:16:46,557 --> 00:16:49,949
Nuclear war, Dad, your
flesh is gonna melt off.

382
00:16:49,950 --> 00:16:51,314
- What a cute little boy.

383
00:16:51,315 --> 00:16:53,973
- I just remembered Big Ethel.

384
00:16:53,974 --> 00:16:54,905
- Big what?

385
00:16:54,906 --> 00:16:56,346
- Ethel had a crush on your father

386
00:16:56,347 --> 00:16:58,448
and she wasn't terribly attractive.

387
00:16:58,449 --> 00:16:59,889
- The woman lurked behind every corner.

388
00:16:59,890 --> 00:17:01,035
She was relentless.

389
00:17:01,902 --> 00:17:03,253
- Dad's afraid of women.

390
00:17:03,254 --> 00:17:04,724
- Mmm.
- Yeah, women sure.

391
00:17:04,725 --> 00:17:06,856
Yeah women and Big Ethel.

392
00:17:06,857 --> 00:17:08,058
- Are you ready?

393
00:17:08,059 --> 00:17:09,060
Let's do it.

394
00:17:12,614 --> 00:17:13,448
(car door bangs)
(upbeat jazz music)

395
00:17:13,449 --> 00:17:14,455
- You got my card right?

396
00:17:15,896 --> 00:17:17,130
- Hey, Reg.

397
00:17:17,131 --> 00:17:18,538
Ouch.

398
00:17:18,539 --> 00:17:20,340
Neck looks way out of alignment.

399
00:17:20,341 --> 00:17:23,253
- You stay away from me, you big creep.

400
00:17:23,254 --> 00:17:26,050
- So are we okay about Archie?

401
00:17:26,977 --> 00:17:29,191
- Ronnie, I'm in love with Robert.

402
00:17:29,192 --> 00:17:30,526
- Just checking.

403
00:17:32,038 --> 00:17:34,624
(gentle music)

404
00:17:40,829 --> 00:17:43,583
(water splashing)

405
00:17:43,584 --> 00:17:45,235
- Jughead, I'm in trouble.

406
00:17:45,236 --> 00:17:46,916
- Got any food back at your house?

407
00:17:46,917 --> 00:17:49,079
- I got the prom tickets today.

408
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:51,271
If I take Betty, Veronica will hate me

409
00:17:51,272 --> 00:17:53,163
and never talk to me again.

410
00:17:53,164 --> 00:17:56,346
If I take Veronica, Betty will be crushed.

411
00:17:56,347 --> 00:17:58,268
- And hate you and
never talk to you again.

412
00:17:58,269 --> 00:18:01,155
- Jughead, help me come up
with a plan or something.

413
00:18:02,113 --> 00:18:03,114
- Let me think.

414
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:05,421
Hmm.

415
00:18:09,103 --> 00:18:10,702
Got me, this one's a stumper.

416
00:18:10,703 --> 00:18:11,991
(Archie sighs)

417
00:18:11,992 --> 00:18:15,325
Hey, if it's any consolation
15 years from now,

418
00:18:15,326 --> 00:18:17,551
this'll seem like a real minor problem.

419
00:18:17,552 --> 00:18:19,983
(gentle music)

420
00:18:19,984 --> 00:18:22,737
(birds chirping)

421
00:18:26,001 --> 00:18:31,006
- Oh, my god.
- I know.

422
00:18:35,756 --> 00:18:38,241
- (chuckles) Long time.

423
00:18:38,242 --> 00:18:40,161
- Has it?
- It sure has.

424
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:46,207
(Betty giggles)

425
00:18:46,208 --> 00:18:47,209
- Hi.

426
00:18:53,977 --> 00:18:54,978
Hi.

427
00:18:57,559 --> 00:18:58,560
Hi.

428
00:18:59,410 --> 00:19:00,411
Ronnie.

429
00:19:02,443 --> 00:19:03,673
- Robert Miller.

430
00:19:03,674 --> 00:19:04,675
Call me Bob.

431
00:19:05,656 --> 00:19:06,657
- Bob.

432
00:19:11,392 --> 00:19:12,233
- Hi.

433
00:19:12,234 --> 00:19:13,257
- [Betty] Jughead.

434
00:19:15,926 --> 00:19:17,634
- Waka, waka.

435
00:19:17,635 --> 00:19:19,503
- And this is Jughead Junior.

436
00:19:20,905 --> 00:19:25,910
(foot thuds)
(Archie groans)

437
00:19:27,728 --> 00:19:29,693
- Little rascal.

438
00:19:29,694 --> 00:19:30,940
(upbeat music)

439
00:19:30,941 --> 00:19:33,643
- The hot '80's thing was
spending a lot of time

440
00:19:33,644 --> 00:19:35,084
you didn't have getting in shape.

441
00:19:35,085 --> 00:19:37,397
But for the '90's you'll
be spending a lot of money

442
00:19:37,398 --> 00:19:39,500
you don't have on luxury cars, you'll see.

443
00:19:41,272 --> 00:19:42,273
- Excuse me.

444
00:19:47,966 --> 00:19:49,529
- Hi, Ms. Grundy.

445
00:19:49,530 --> 00:19:51,361
You look even more beautiful than usual.

446
00:19:51,362 --> 00:19:53,166
- Get your elbows off the table.

447
00:19:55,326 --> 00:19:57,126
- Oh, Midge and I tried
practicing in the city,

448
00:19:57,127 --> 00:19:59,349
but it wasn't for us.

449
00:19:59,350 --> 00:20:01,631
The last straw was a parking ticket.

450
00:20:01,632 --> 00:20:04,994
I go to court and I ask the
judge, why'd I get a ticket?

451
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,637
I've been parking there for three months.

452
00:20:07,638 --> 00:20:09,239
The judge asked me, "If I read the sign?"

453
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:13,162
So I say, "The sign said fine for parking,

454
00:20:13,163 --> 00:20:14,442
so I parked there."

455
00:20:18,029 --> 00:20:20,865
(Robert chuckles)

456
00:20:24,185 --> 00:20:25,186
- Hi.

457
00:20:26,518 --> 00:20:27,519
Hi.

458
00:20:29,950 --> 00:20:31,692
- There you are.
- Hey, Jug.

459
00:20:37,157 --> 00:20:38,688
- So writing didn't work out,

460
00:20:38,689 --> 00:20:41,542
and I moved to Midvale and
started teaching second grade.

461
00:20:42,743 --> 00:20:45,809
The pay is not great, but the kids are.

462
00:20:46,797 --> 00:20:48,849
I can't wait until I start having my own.

463
00:20:50,070 --> 00:20:51,725
- We're in negotiation on that.

464
00:20:54,064 --> 00:20:55,449
- Hi.
- Hi.

465
00:20:58,238 --> 00:21:01,090
- So how do I look?

466
00:21:01,091 --> 00:21:02,412
- You want a professional opinion?

467
00:21:02,413 --> 00:21:03,446
- Sure.

468
00:21:03,447 --> 00:21:04,514
- You look terrific.

469
00:21:04,515 --> 00:21:06,329
That'll be $120.

470
00:21:06,330 --> 00:21:07,163
(Reggie chuckles)

471
00:21:07,164 --> 00:21:10,219
- I've been taking care of
business for daddy overseas,

472
00:21:10,220 --> 00:21:11,722
trying to learn the languages.

473
00:21:12,623 --> 00:21:14,304
Enough about me.

474
00:21:14,305 --> 00:21:16,045
What have you been doing?

475
00:21:16,046 --> 00:21:19,652
- Oh, not much until Monday morning.

476
00:21:19,653 --> 00:21:22,562
Then I'm finally kissing
this town goodbye.

477
00:21:22,563 --> 00:21:23,494
- Really?

478
00:21:23,495 --> 00:21:24,784
- Yeah, next, next week,

479
00:21:24,785 --> 00:21:27,036
I'll be working for the
biggest law firm in the city.

480
00:21:27,037 --> 00:21:29,142
And I'm moving in with my fiance.

481
00:21:30,461 --> 00:21:31,545
- Your fiance.

482
00:21:37,288 --> 00:21:40,700
(glass clanging)
(group chattering)

483
00:21:40,701 --> 00:21:42,175
- Ms. Grundy, a toast.

484
00:21:43,704 --> 00:21:46,075
- I consider you all living proof

485
00:21:46,076 --> 00:21:48,841
that common sense can be pounded
into young people's heads.

486
00:21:48,842 --> 00:21:49,676
(group laughing)

487
00:21:49,677 --> 00:21:50,727
- I'll drink to that.

488
00:21:52,052 --> 00:21:56,800
- I have so much planned,
picnics, field trips, a concert.

489
00:21:57,889 --> 00:21:58,723
(Veronica laughing)

490
00:21:58,724 --> 00:22:00,700
That's right, a concert.

491
00:22:00,701 --> 00:22:02,682
At the party Sunday night

492
00:22:02,683 --> 00:22:07,688
we're having the greatest band
in Riverdale High history.

493
00:22:07,848 --> 00:22:09,058
The Archies.

494
00:22:09,059 --> 00:22:10,880
(group gasping)

495
00:22:10,881 --> 00:22:12,189
- Did you know about this?
- I didn't know.

496
00:22:12,190 --> 00:22:13,024
- [Archie] Ronnie.

497
00:22:13,025 --> 00:22:15,349
- You're Moose's son, aren't you?

498
00:22:18,419 --> 00:22:20,043
He certainly is.

499
00:22:21,091 --> 00:22:22,092
- I'm Jordan.

500
00:22:23,313 --> 00:22:24,424
- Max.

501
00:22:24,425 --> 00:22:25,749
- I'll let you two bond.

502
00:22:28,929 --> 00:22:30,039
- Betcha I can think of worse things

503
00:22:30,040 --> 00:22:31,515
to do to Archie than you can.

504
00:22:32,649 --> 00:22:34,238
- Cool.

505
00:22:34,239 --> 00:22:37,159
(group chattering)

506
00:22:38,359 --> 00:22:39,679
- What a place right?

507
00:22:39,680 --> 00:22:40,703
- Always has been.

508
00:22:40,704 --> 00:22:42,261
- What a hostess.

509
00:22:42,262 --> 00:22:43,643
Reminds me of this hot little number

510
00:22:43,644 --> 00:22:45,685
I picked up in a museum.

511
00:22:45,686 --> 00:22:48,396
It was before I met Betty of course.

512
00:22:48,397 --> 00:22:49,230
- Of course.

513
00:22:49,231 --> 00:22:50,616
- Hey, don't give me wrong,

514
00:22:50,617 --> 00:22:52,592
Betty's the best thing
that ever happened to me.

515
00:22:52,593 --> 00:22:54,544
We're even talking about getting married.

516
00:22:54,545 --> 00:22:56,530
But you know how it is.

517
00:22:57,698 --> 00:22:59,983
- How exactly is it, Bob?

518
00:23:00,821 --> 00:23:02,141
- It's kinda hard for a guy like me

519
00:23:02,142 --> 00:23:04,895
to think about getting married
without getting nervous.

520
00:23:08,936 --> 00:23:11,991
- You should have heard
this Robert call me Bob Guy.

521
00:23:11,992 --> 00:23:13,673
Gotta talk to Betty.

522
00:23:13,674 --> 00:23:15,625
- Compensational denial, Arch.

523
00:23:15,626 --> 00:23:18,111
It's not just Betty's
welfare you're worried about.

524
00:23:20,821 --> 00:23:22,051
- Uncle Archie.
- Yeah.

525
00:23:22,052 --> 00:23:23,346
- Can Max sleep over?

526
00:23:24,635 --> 00:23:27,066
- We'll have a pajama party from hell.

527
00:23:27,067 --> 00:23:28,147
- That means yes.

528
00:23:28,148 --> 00:23:29,559
- I'll go tell my dad.

529
00:23:29,560 --> 00:23:31,330
- Now look if-

530
00:23:31,331 --> 00:23:33,636
- Andrews you should have told me.

531
00:23:33,637 --> 00:23:35,587
- Look at the resemblance.

532
00:23:35,588 --> 00:23:36,826
- Oh, no, no, no, he, he's not.

533
00:23:36,827 --> 00:23:40,129
- Shame, Andrews, you didn't
even tell me you were married.

534
00:23:40,130 --> 00:23:42,273
- I'm not married, Mr. Weatherbee.

535
00:23:42,274 --> 00:23:43,553
(Ms. Grundy gasps)

536
00:23:43,554 --> 00:23:46,568
- Shame, Andrews, shame.

537
00:23:46,569 --> 00:23:49,154
(Archie sighs)

538
00:23:54,485 --> 00:23:55,451
- There you are, sir.

539
00:23:55,451 --> 00:23:56,452
Thank you.

540
00:24:00,379 --> 00:24:03,299
(group chattering)

541
00:24:06,957 --> 00:24:09,258
- Alone it last.

542
00:24:09,259 --> 00:24:10,794
I never forgot you, Archie.

543
00:24:11,962 --> 00:24:13,372
I can mend this for you.

544
00:24:13,373 --> 00:24:14,207
- Oh.

545
00:24:14,208 --> 00:24:16,500
- Maybe later, maybe tonight?

546
00:24:17,608 --> 00:24:18,609
Then it's a date.

547
00:24:21,076 --> 00:24:24,246
(gentle upbeat music)

548
00:24:27,188 --> 00:24:28,022
(ominous music)

549
00:24:28,023 --> 00:24:30,608
- [Staff] All right, take care.

550
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:36,684
- Strike one.

551
00:24:37,998 --> 00:24:41,601
- Jughead, Betty is crazy
glued at the hip to this guy.

552
00:24:41,602 --> 00:24:44,215
Now how can I get her alone?

553
00:24:44,216 --> 00:24:46,736
- Hmm.

554
00:24:46,737 --> 00:24:48,477
- Archie, forget the blonde stuff.

555
00:24:48,478 --> 00:24:49,743
Veronica's the ticket.

556
00:24:52,232 --> 00:24:53,553
- [Jughead] Archie, if
you wanna be with Betty,

557
00:24:53,554 --> 00:24:55,084
maybe Jordy and I should take Robert

558
00:24:55,085 --> 00:24:56,680
on a little tour of Riverdale.

559
00:25:01,031 --> 00:25:03,072
- That was a dirty trick.

560
00:25:03,073 --> 00:25:05,840
- It's the only way I could
get you away from Robert.

561
00:25:05,841 --> 00:25:09,649
- I don't wanna be away from Robert.

562
00:25:09,650 --> 00:25:12,415
- So where'd you meet him?

563
00:25:13,283 --> 00:25:14,307
- In a museum.

564
00:25:15,351 --> 00:25:17,036
- A museum?

565
00:25:17,037 --> 00:25:18,177
- Yes, Archie, a museum.

566
00:25:18,178 --> 00:25:20,159
Is there something wrong with that?

567
00:25:20,160 --> 00:25:21,510
- No, no, of course not.

568
00:25:21,511 --> 00:25:23,496
What could possibly be wrong with that?

569
00:25:24,635 --> 00:25:26,465
- I was staring at a Picasso

570
00:25:26,466 --> 00:25:29,653
and I looked up and
Robert was staring at me.

571
00:25:31,151 --> 00:25:32,508
Finally, he came over and asked me,

572
00:25:32,509 --> 00:25:35,084
"What was I doing for
the rest of my life?"

573
00:25:35,085 --> 00:25:36,086
- He didn't.

574
00:25:36,977 --> 00:25:37,978
- He did.

575
00:25:39,169 --> 00:25:40,854
Archie, what's the problem?

576
00:25:41,782 --> 00:25:42,783
- Robert.

577
00:25:43,764 --> 00:25:44,904
He pushes you around.

578
00:25:44,905 --> 00:25:46,706
He's, he's two-faced.

579
00:25:46,707 --> 00:25:49,412
For God's sakes, Betty, he's an MBA.

580
00:25:50,911 --> 00:25:52,956
- And your suit looks just like his.

581
00:25:55,025 --> 00:25:58,177
Are you angry I'm dating someone like you?

582
00:25:58,178 --> 00:26:00,309
- Like me, like, like me.

583
00:26:00,310 --> 00:26:04,213
Gee, Betty, I think you're
judging his book by its cover.

584
00:26:04,214 --> 00:26:07,100
And if I were you, I'd
catch up on my reading.

585
00:26:08,538 --> 00:26:10,674
- Here, my latest story.

586
00:26:11,692 --> 00:26:14,153
- I didn't know you wanted to be a writer.

587
00:26:14,154 --> 00:26:17,879
- I wanna be both, a writer and a teacher.

588
00:26:17,880 --> 00:26:19,258
(Archie clears throat)

589
00:26:19,259 --> 00:26:22,535
- It was a beautiful sunny
day for the Easter egg hunt.

590
00:26:23,974 --> 00:26:24,975
- Well?

591
00:26:26,046 --> 00:26:28,692
- It's, it's really sweet.

592
00:26:31,692 --> 00:26:34,758
- That's what the
publishers say too sweet.

593
00:26:35,716 --> 00:26:38,080
But I'm not giving up,
I have something to say.

594
00:26:38,081 --> 00:26:41,991
I, I just don't know what it is yet.

595
00:26:41,992 --> 00:26:43,046
- Guess what I found?

596
00:26:44,908 --> 00:26:45,905
(Betty and Archie giggling)

597
00:26:45,906 --> 00:26:47,632
- Oh.

598
00:26:47,633 --> 00:26:48,634
Look at us.

599
00:26:50,606 --> 00:26:53,459
- God, how many times do we
sit right here in this booth?

600
00:26:54,635 --> 00:26:55,568
- Say, you remember the time

601
00:26:55,569 --> 00:26:57,787
that we helped Pops paint the store?

602
00:26:57,788 --> 00:26:58,622
- Yes.

603
00:26:58,623 --> 00:26:59,949
And when Mr. Weatherbee
caught us cutting class

604
00:26:59,950 --> 00:27:01,240
at the amusement park.

605
00:27:01,241 --> 00:27:02,142
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

606
00:27:02,143 --> 00:27:04,063
I talked him into going up on
the roller coaster with us.

607
00:27:04,064 --> 00:27:05,443
He wouldn't speak to me for weeks.

608
00:27:05,444 --> 00:27:07,642
(Betty giggles)

609
00:27:07,643 --> 00:27:10,228
(gentle music)

610
00:27:11,421 --> 00:27:13,123
- Remember the night of the storm.

611
00:27:14,214 --> 00:27:16,446
- When we got stuck

612
00:27:18,366 --> 00:27:19,957
and we couldn't get home until morning

613
00:27:23,794 --> 00:27:25,418
and our parents thought that we.

614
00:27:27,878 --> 00:27:28,932
- But we didn't.

615
00:27:30,565 --> 00:27:31,566
- We did.

616
00:27:33,674 --> 00:27:35,925
I can't believe that you don't remember.

617
00:27:35,926 --> 00:27:38,091
- Archie, I'm, I'm sure
I'd remember if we.

618
00:27:42,009 --> 00:27:43,230
(Archie chuckles)

619
00:27:43,231 --> 00:27:46,766
(Betty chuckles)

620
00:27:46,767 --> 00:27:47,768
Archie.

621
00:27:48,658 --> 00:27:50,403
- Oh boy, it was a long time ago.

622
00:27:55,028 --> 00:27:56,612
- Look at the time.

623
00:28:02,688 --> 00:28:04,603
- Hey babe, what do you say you-

624
00:28:04,604 --> 00:28:06,499
- Yeah, go cipher some gas, pal.

625
00:28:08,358 --> 00:28:09,359
- Please.

626
00:28:10,370 --> 00:28:11,600
You can't do this to me.

627
00:28:11,601 --> 00:28:12,896
Reggie, wait.

628
00:28:14,856 --> 00:28:16,075
(phone thuds)

629
00:28:16,076 --> 00:28:16,910
- [Archie] Pops.

630
00:28:16,911 --> 00:28:18,447
- Reggie's evicting me.

631
00:28:18,448 --> 00:28:21,821
He's expanding that, that thing.

632
00:28:21,822 --> 00:28:23,552
- Well, he can't do that.

633
00:28:23,553 --> 00:28:24,633
- Yes he can.

634
00:28:24,634 --> 00:28:25,839
He owns the building.

635
00:28:30,118 --> 00:28:33,492
(door clicks)
(bell ringing)

636
00:28:33,493 --> 00:28:34,494
- He can't do that.

637
00:28:38,298 --> 00:28:39,859
- [Jughead] I got lost.

638
00:28:39,860 --> 00:28:41,751
- Driving around your hometown?

639
00:28:41,752 --> 00:28:44,243
- Oh, well see, Jughead has a notoriously

640
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:45,718
bad sense of direction.

641
00:28:49,109 --> 00:28:50,193
- Get a compass.

642
00:28:51,320 --> 00:28:52,615
- Yeah, okay.

643
00:28:54,364 --> 00:28:56,860
Hey, was that teamwork or what?

644
00:28:57,697 --> 00:28:58,698
- I don't know.

645
00:29:01,902 --> 00:29:03,215
- Sure, I can do it.

646
00:29:03,216 --> 00:29:05,204
- Keep it together.
- Legal as an 18 year old.

647
00:29:05,205 --> 00:29:08,748
- Reggie, Reggie, Pops
kept that place for us.

648
00:29:08,749 --> 00:29:12,281
So we'd have a place to
eat, and talk, and grow up.

649
00:29:12,282 --> 00:29:13,260
- And we did.

650
00:29:13,261 --> 00:29:16,165
You grew up, I grew up,
and I'm kicking him out.

651
00:29:16,166 --> 00:29:17,877
Only you're still playing the patsy, Arch,

652
00:29:17,878 --> 00:29:19,618
just like high school.

653
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:23,260
Giving everybody else the
breaks and not getting any.

654
00:29:24,149 --> 00:29:26,109
Look don't get me wrong.

655
00:29:27,187 --> 00:29:30,159
But if you wanna get the
finer things outta life,

656
00:29:30,160 --> 00:29:33,582
you gotta put this knee
jerk, goody goody act to bed.

657
00:29:33,583 --> 00:29:36,585
- Wrong, Reggie, I
changed, I changed plenty,

658
00:29:36,586 --> 00:29:38,808
but you, you just got worse.

659
00:29:38,809 --> 00:29:40,759
- You're leaving, what do you care?

660
00:29:40,760 --> 00:29:42,111
- Because I have a heart.

661
00:29:42,112 --> 00:29:44,217
Don't you have any feelings?

662
00:29:46,148 --> 00:29:49,048
- Okay, I'll make you a deal.

663
00:29:49,049 --> 00:29:51,540
You ask Pop how much it's gonna cost him

664
00:29:51,541 --> 00:29:53,252
to set up a new place

665
00:29:53,253 --> 00:29:56,019
and I'll write him a
check for old time sake.

666
00:29:57,337 --> 00:30:02,342
- Reggie, you can't buy old
times or a clean conscience.

667
00:30:03,733 --> 00:30:05,130
- What can I say, I'm torture.

668
00:30:05,131 --> 00:30:10,136
- [Instructor] Out, side, up, and down.

669
00:30:16,216 --> 00:30:17,623
Good.

670
00:30:17,624 --> 00:30:19,541
Going.
- Sir, Reggie Mantle here.

671
00:30:19,542 --> 00:30:20,430
- [Instructor] Good.

672
00:30:20,431 --> 00:30:21,901
- Listen, sir, we're gonna
have a little problem

673
00:30:21,902 --> 00:30:23,736
with the health club expansion.

674
00:30:24,784 --> 00:30:26,980
I had to offer some moving expenses.

675
00:30:29,289 --> 00:30:31,630
Yes, sir, I know, I
understand it's your money.

676
00:30:31,631 --> 00:30:35,384
But you see, I'm under community pressure.

677
00:30:35,385 --> 00:30:36,886
- From whom?

678
00:30:36,887 --> 00:30:38,438
- [Reggie] Archie Andrews, sir.

679
00:30:41,421 --> 00:30:42,422
- Strike two.

680
00:30:44,012 --> 00:30:48,714

681
00:30:48,715 --> 00:30:51,548

689
00:31:08,609 --> 00:31:09,937
- It's me.

690
00:31:09,938 --> 00:31:10,939
Yeah, Jordy.

00:31:28,929 --> 00:31:31,690
That's the first time
he asked to go to bed.

701
00:31:31,691 --> 00:31:33,552
I guess it is kind of dated.

702
00:31:33,553 --> 00:31:35,174
- You know, Jughead,

703
00:31:35,175 --> 00:31:39,318
something, something really
weird happened this afternoon.

704
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:40,940
I was with Betty and-

705
00:31:40,941 --> 00:31:43,402
- You found yourself
incredibly attracted to her.

706
00:31:43,403 --> 00:31:44,693
- How'd you know?

707
00:31:44,694 --> 00:31:47,306
- Well, it's a typical
regression construct.

708
00:31:47,307 --> 00:31:48,777
You'd feel the same way about Veronica,

709
00:31:48,778 --> 00:31:51,420
except she changed more than
Betty since high school.

710
00:31:51,421 --> 00:31:52,771
But it's divergent thinking.

711
00:31:52,772 --> 00:31:54,663
It's irrelevant.

712
00:31:54,664 --> 00:31:55,959
The past, Arch.

713
00:31:58,767 --> 00:32:02,452
- (chuckles) Well, we
were blissfully ignorant

714
00:32:03,643 --> 00:32:05,384
when we graduated.

715
00:32:05,385 --> 00:32:07,087
- God, I wish we hadn't done that.

716
00:32:08,028 --> 00:32:10,909
- You know, I spent my entire life

717
00:32:10,910 --> 00:32:11,781
trying to do what's right.

718
00:32:11,782 --> 00:32:13,312
You know what I ended up with?

719
00:32:13,313 --> 00:32:14,753
Zilch.

720
00:32:14,754 --> 00:32:16,885
Spent all my time trying to figure out

721
00:32:16,886 --> 00:32:20,129
which woman I really loved
and what love really was.

722
00:32:20,130 --> 00:32:22,321
And all I ever got for it
were a couple of letters

723
00:32:22,322 --> 00:32:24,374
from Betty and Veronica and then nothing.

724
00:32:25,565 --> 00:32:27,006
Forget it, Jug.

725
00:32:27,007 --> 00:32:28,357
Forget it.

726
00:32:28,358 --> 00:32:31,750
I am finally gonna do what's right for me.

727
00:32:31,751 --> 00:32:33,402
I am gonna get out of this town

728
00:32:33,403 --> 00:32:35,959
and I am gonna do something for myself.

729
00:32:39,409 --> 00:32:40,410
- Wow.

730
00:32:41,091 --> 00:32:44,813
- Uh, well, to me, deep down inside,

731
00:32:44,814 --> 00:32:46,645
you're still the same old Arch.

732
00:32:46,646 --> 00:32:49,857
Something I for one am
pretty thankful for.

733
00:32:49,858 --> 00:32:52,381
- (scoffs) But you just said
that the past was irrelevant.

734
00:32:52,382 --> 00:32:54,333
You're contradicting yourself.

735
00:32:54,334 --> 00:32:57,340
- Of course I am, I'm a
psychiatrist, that's my gig.

736
00:32:58,478 --> 00:33:00,553
Well, I'm sorry our time's up for today.

737
00:33:04,275 --> 00:33:05,109
(Archie sighs)

738
00:33:05,110 --> 00:33:06,778
- Uh-huh.

739
00:33:06,779 --> 00:33:08,122
Yeah.

740
00:33:08,123 --> 00:33:09,345
Yeah.

741
00:33:09,346 --> 00:33:10,180
No, honey.

742
00:33:10,181 --> 00:33:11,991
It's been great seeing everybody.

743
00:33:11,992 --> 00:33:12,993
Yeah, and,

744
00:33:14,844 --> 00:33:17,184
why that little! (gasps)

745
00:33:17,185 --> 00:33:20,521
(playful ominous music)

746
00:33:26,268 --> 00:33:29,282
(card clanging)

747
00:33:29,283 --> 00:33:31,785
(door clicks)

748
00:33:49,259 --> 00:33:50,669
Well, anyway.

749
00:33:50,670 --> 00:33:52,471
- [Pam] Honey, I've been rethinking

750
00:33:52,472 --> 00:33:54,665
the whole silver pattern situation.

751
00:33:54,666 --> 00:33:56,855
And I really want something more

752
00:33:56,856 --> 00:33:59,978
simple, streamlined, classic.

753
00:33:59,979 --> 00:34:02,981
Something more a la Georg Jensen
as opposed to the Tiffany.

754
00:34:02,982 --> 00:34:04,183
- Hello, Archie.

755
00:34:04,184 --> 00:34:05,594
- I really-
- Gotta call you back.

756
00:34:05,595 --> 00:34:06,429
- [Pam] Honey.

757
00:34:06,429 --> 00:34:07,430
Archie.

758
00:34:10,520 --> 00:34:14,273
- Veronica, I, I can't do this.

759
00:34:14,274 --> 00:34:15,774
- [Veronica] Do what?

760
00:34:15,775 --> 00:34:20,780
- Ronnie, I, I don't think
you came by to mend my shirt,

761
00:34:21,151 --> 00:34:24,943
if you know what I mean.

762
00:34:24,944 --> 00:34:25,778
(ladder thuds)

763
00:34:25,779 --> 00:34:27,876
- You think I'm trying to seduce you?

764
00:34:27,877 --> 00:34:28,921
- Well, yeah.

765
00:34:32,619 --> 00:34:34,457
- You do catch on quick.

766
00:34:38,958 --> 00:34:42,561
- [Archie] Ronnie, I have a fiance.

767
00:34:42,562 --> 00:34:44,046
- Don't worry, I've had 13.

768
00:34:45,071 --> 00:34:46,421
- No, no, no, no, no, no.

769
00:34:46,422 --> 00:34:48,477
Okay, all right, look, look, look.

770
00:34:48,478 --> 00:34:51,300
Oh boy, let's, let's say that, that,

771
00:34:51,301 --> 00:34:53,102
that you and I were married.

772
00:34:53,103 --> 00:34:57,336
Now, how would you feel
if I, if I did this.

773
00:34:57,337 --> 00:34:58,338
- Wonderful.

774
00:35:01,151 --> 00:35:02,171
I think married couples

775
00:35:02,172 --> 00:35:04,993
should make love as often as possible.

776
00:35:04,994 --> 00:35:07,400
- Waka, waka.

777
00:35:08,778 --> 00:35:09,779
- Hold that thought.

778
00:35:12,019 --> 00:35:14,798
(Jordan yelling)
(suspenseful music)

779
00:35:14,799 --> 00:35:16,253
- [Jordan] Max, hold it.

780
00:35:16,254 --> 00:35:19,558
(sultry music)

781
00:35:19,559 --> 00:35:21,890
- Now we're getting somewhere.

782
00:35:21,891 --> 00:35:25,149
(Jordan yelling)
(playful music)

783
00:35:25,150 --> 00:35:27,902
(Jordan yelling)

784
00:35:30,096 --> 00:35:31,097
- Whoa, oh!

785
00:35:34,108 --> 00:35:35,109
Max.

786
00:35:36,008 --> 00:35:37,169
Max.

787
00:35:37,170 --> 00:35:38,003
(Jordan yells)
(ladder thuds)

788
00:35:38,004 --> 00:35:39,918
(gentle dramatic music)

789
00:35:39,919 --> 00:35:41,480
- Where do you wanna go now?

790
00:35:41,481 --> 00:35:42,482
- Down.

791
00:35:43,493 --> 00:35:45,053
(dog barking)

792
00:35:45,054 --> 00:35:47,857
- You think this is some kind
of one night stand for me.

793
00:35:48,928 --> 00:35:49,982
You're wrong.

794
00:35:52,172 --> 00:35:55,388
15 years ago, I was too
young and afraid to admit it.

795
00:35:56,586 --> 00:36:00,489
I was in love with you then
and I'm in love with you now.

796
00:36:00,490 --> 00:36:01,884
- Ronnie, I don't know what to say.

797
00:36:01,885 --> 00:36:06,890
I'm, I'm really flattered,
but I'm still engaged.

798
00:36:07,337 --> 00:36:11,180
- Can she understand you

799
00:36:11,181 --> 00:36:13,252
1/10th of the way we
understand each other?

800
00:36:13,253 --> 00:36:15,658
I mean, doesn't that mean anything to you?

801
00:36:16,796 --> 00:36:17,936
Don't I?

802
00:36:17,937 --> 00:36:21,774
- Ronnie, you mean a lot to me, but.

803
00:36:21,775 --> 00:36:22,776
- But?

804
00:36:25,421 --> 00:36:26,422
- Ronnie.

805
00:36:30,847 --> 00:36:31,848
Ronnie.

806
00:36:32,682 --> 00:36:34,487
I'm trying to keep what we had.

807
00:36:37,096 --> 00:36:38,097
I'm not forgetting.

808
00:36:39,078 --> 00:36:41,570
No one ever falls in love
like their first time.

809
00:36:41,571 --> 00:36:45,294
But you can't ever be that way again.

810
00:36:45,295 --> 00:36:46,949
Everything has changed.

811
00:36:47,877 --> 00:36:51,990
And even if I wasn't engaged,
would it really work?

812
00:36:51,991 --> 00:36:54,397
I mean, how many times
have you been married?

813
00:36:55,330 --> 00:36:56,699
- Base 10?

814
00:36:56,700 --> 00:36:58,617
- In base 10.

815
00:36:58,618 --> 00:36:59,957
- Three or so.

816
00:36:59,958 --> 00:37:01,750
- Or so?
- Okay, four.

817
00:37:01,751 --> 00:37:04,303
- Okay, see, I don't wanna be number five.

818
00:37:04,304 --> 00:37:06,495
I don't wanna be number anything.

819
00:37:06,496 --> 00:37:09,678
Do you really want to chalk
me up as another conquest

820
00:37:09,679 --> 00:37:14,303
or, or do you want me to be

821
00:37:14,304 --> 00:37:17,640
what you'll always be to
me, something special.

822
00:37:18,778 --> 00:37:20,313
- Am I really special to you?

823
00:37:21,481 --> 00:37:23,432
- Now and always.

824
00:37:23,433 --> 00:37:27,065
- Archie, I know I come on strong.

825
00:37:27,066 --> 00:37:29,588
It's the way I know how to deal with men.

826
00:37:29,589 --> 00:37:33,942
I guess it's a handicap,
but as far as handicaps go,

827
00:37:33,943 --> 00:37:35,658
it's not too bad, right?

828
00:37:37,697 --> 00:37:38,698
- Right.

829
00:37:41,733 --> 00:37:44,903
(gentle upbeat music)

830
00:37:46,402 --> 00:37:48,821
(door bangs)

831
00:37:56,165 --> 00:37:57,189
- What a dork.

832
00:37:58,198 --> 00:38:00,784
(sultry music)

833
00:38:01,678 --> 00:38:02,512
(car door bangs)

834
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:05,894
(car engine revving)

835
00:38:05,895 --> 00:38:07,550
- Strike three.

836
00:38:10,069 --> 00:38:13,255
I told him once to stay away from her.

837
00:38:14,123 --> 00:38:17,129
Now I need you to be more convincing.

838
00:38:18,057 --> 00:38:19,318
- You don't want him to see her again?

839
00:38:19,319 --> 00:38:20,320
- Never.

840
00:38:21,180 --> 00:38:22,181
- Yes, sir.

841
00:38:24,786 --> 00:38:26,945
(birds chirping)

842
00:38:26,946 --> 00:38:28,327
- Sleep okay?

843
00:38:28,328 --> 00:38:31,570
- Well, apart from the
jello in my bed, just fine.

844
00:38:31,571 --> 00:38:32,921
- [Jughead] Jordan.

845
00:38:32,922 --> 00:38:34,984
- No, no, no, no, it's okay.

846
00:38:34,985 --> 00:38:38,176
'Cause when I got the
jello off my feet, feet,

847
00:38:38,177 --> 00:38:40,782
I just put it right back in the bowl.

848
00:38:40,783 --> 00:38:43,369
(Max laughing)

849
00:38:48,057 --> 00:38:49,648
- Moving expenses.

850
00:38:49,649 --> 00:38:50,879
40 years, I'm here.

851
00:38:50,880 --> 00:38:51,990
40 years.

852
00:38:51,991 --> 00:38:54,397
You kids come and go, but I've stayed.

853
00:38:55,415 --> 00:38:57,636
- This place means a lot
to me, Pops, so do you.

854
00:38:57,637 --> 00:39:00,669
- How much can we mean to
you now that you're leaving?

855
00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:01,810
Oh, I'm sorry, Archie.

856
00:39:01,811 --> 00:39:03,342
I didn't mean that.

857
00:39:03,343 --> 00:39:05,684
- Don't apologize, Pops, and don't panic.

858
00:39:05,685 --> 00:39:07,726
Now we'll go through the
lease, all the documents.

859
00:39:07,727 --> 00:39:09,321
We'll develop a plan of attack.

860
00:39:10,249 --> 00:39:12,895
I'm gonna be your lawyer,
Pops, if you'll have me.

861
00:39:14,333 --> 00:39:15,744
- That's the way it is.

862
00:39:15,745 --> 00:39:17,245
You give the kids everything you can

863
00:39:17,246 --> 00:39:19,853
and when they grow up, they give it back.

864
00:39:19,854 --> 00:39:20,688
(Pop chuckles)

865
00:39:20,689 --> 00:39:22,981
Oh, Archie, the 40 years
are worth every second.

866
00:39:22,982 --> 00:39:23,983
- Pops.

867
00:39:26,687 --> 00:39:28,282
(upbeat music)

868
00:39:28,283 --> 00:39:29,719
(ball thuds)
(birds chirping)

869
00:39:29,720 --> 00:39:31,276
(group chattering)

870
00:39:31,277 --> 00:39:33,697
(ball thuds)

871
00:39:45,191 --> 00:39:47,861
(playful music)

872
00:40:03,312 --> 00:40:05,327
- I went to see Archie last night.

873
00:40:06,279 --> 00:40:07,484
(whistle blowing)

874
00:40:07,485 --> 00:40:10,237
(balls thudding)

875
00:40:12,171 --> 00:40:14,896
- You decided what you're
wearing to the prom yet?

876
00:40:14,897 --> 00:40:17,009
- I've narrowed it down to 16 outfits.

877
00:40:19,198 --> 00:40:20,900
Let's just get it out in the open.

878
00:40:22,051 --> 00:40:24,604
We're both wondering who
Archie's gonna ask, right?

879
00:40:26,946 --> 00:40:31,359
- If he asks you, I promise
I won't be mad or anything.

880
00:40:31,360 --> 00:40:32,361
- Same here.

881
00:40:33,763 --> 00:40:37,816
As a matter of fact, I really
don't care who he asks.

882
00:40:37,817 --> 00:40:38,818
- Really?

883
00:40:39,649 --> 00:40:40,789
- Why should I?

884
00:40:40,790 --> 00:40:45,083
I'm marrying a tall,
dark, handsome freshman.

885
00:40:45,084 --> 00:40:47,305
- How romantic.

886
00:40:47,306 --> 00:40:49,171
- We'll live in Paris and,

887
00:40:51,811 --> 00:40:52,865
Archie.

888
00:41:01,546 --> 00:41:02,994
(birds chirping)

889
00:41:02,995 --> 00:41:04,182
(racket thuds)

890
00:41:04,183 --> 00:41:06,369
- Why are you telling me this?

891
00:41:06,370 --> 00:41:07,204
(racket thuds)

892
00:41:07,204 --> 00:41:08,205
- Fair play.

893
00:41:08,928 --> 00:41:10,580
I'm not gonna pursue him anymore.

894
00:41:11,865 --> 00:41:12,699
(racket thuds)

895
00:41:12,700 --> 00:41:14,272
You can do what you like.

896
00:41:14,273 --> 00:41:16,592
- I'm not going to do anything.

897
00:41:16,593 --> 00:41:17,517
(racket thuds)

898
00:41:17,518 --> 00:41:18,868
- It's that simple for you?

899
00:41:19,858 --> 00:41:23,177
(racket thuds)

900
00:41:23,178 --> 00:41:24,963
(glass shattering)

901
00:41:24,964 --> 00:41:26,117
- Of course.

902
00:41:26,118 --> 00:41:28,179
(car horn honking)

903
00:41:28,180 --> 00:41:30,635
(Veronica chuckles)

904
00:41:30,636 --> 00:41:32,020
(hammer thudding)

905
00:41:32,021 --> 00:41:34,783
- I know that Pop's eviction
sounds lawful, Judge Brown,

906
00:41:34,784 --> 00:41:37,546
but I'm gonna find a zoning law, anything.

907
00:41:37,547 --> 00:41:39,708
It's a matter of principle.

908
00:41:39,709 --> 00:41:41,544
- I've never seen you so passionate.

909
00:41:42,411 --> 00:41:44,514
You have another side to you, Mr. Andrews.

910
00:41:45,505 --> 00:41:48,236
Makes me wish you were using
your talents to a better end.

911
00:41:48,237 --> 00:41:49,918
- Well, Your Honor, I will be,

912
00:41:49,919 --> 00:41:52,410
I'm moving to a big firm in the city.

913
00:41:52,411 --> 00:41:56,434
- Where I'm sure you'll be
defending lots of big criminals,

914
00:41:56,435 --> 00:41:59,708
but I still can't open
court on a Saturday.

915
00:41:59,709 --> 00:42:02,290
- Your Honor, I'm going
to find a way to make you.

916
00:42:02,291 --> 00:42:03,391
A precedent, something.

917
00:42:03,392 --> 00:42:06,062
(wood thudding)

918
00:42:11,180 --> 00:42:12,264
- As I would expect.

919
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:22,530
(group chattering)

920
00:42:22,531 --> 00:42:23,546
- [Librarian] All right, thank you.

921
00:42:23,547 --> 00:42:27,429
- I have something to
say to you as a friend.

922
00:42:28,327 --> 00:42:30,278
What were you doing with
Veronica last night?

923
00:42:30,279 --> 00:42:31,780
You're engaged.

924
00:42:31,781 --> 00:42:33,251
- Nothing happened.

925
00:42:33,252 --> 00:42:34,957
- And I'm supposed to believe that.

926
00:42:42,955 --> 00:42:44,753
How do you define nothing?

927
00:42:44,754 --> 00:42:48,627
- Look, she broke into my
house and took off her clothes.

928
00:42:48,628 --> 00:42:50,098
That's all.
- That's all?

929
00:42:50,099 --> 00:42:51,100
- I swear.

930
00:42:53,598 --> 00:42:56,222
No, no, we didn't, you know?

931
00:42:57,426 --> 00:42:59,261
- No, I don't know.

932
00:43:03,192 --> 00:43:06,065
Are you positive that you didn't?

933
00:43:07,330 --> 00:43:08,957
- [Librarian] Excuse me.

934
00:43:08,958 --> 00:43:10,248
- Yes.

935
00:43:10,249 --> 00:43:14,814
I mean, I think I'd
know if we'd, you know.

936
00:43:15,775 --> 00:43:17,425
- Okay.

937
00:43:17,426 --> 00:43:19,948
I'm just making sure that
you're being responsible

938
00:43:19,949 --> 00:43:21,349
to your fiance and.

939
00:43:21,350 --> 00:43:24,687
(gentle romantic music)

940
00:43:26,195 --> 00:43:27,196
No, I'm not.

941
00:43:29,048 --> 00:43:30,162
I'm being jealous.

942
00:43:34,003 --> 00:43:35,604
And I feel like a complete fool.

943
00:43:41,836 --> 00:43:44,421
(birds chirping)

944
00:43:44,422 --> 00:43:46,059
(dog barking)

945
00:43:46,060 --> 00:43:49,230
(gentle guitar music)

946
00:43:52,231 --> 00:43:53,232
- Hi, Betty.

947
00:43:54,123 --> 00:43:55,114
- Since I haven't heard,

948
00:43:55,115 --> 00:43:57,316
I assume you're taking
Veronica to the prom.

949
00:43:58,172 --> 00:44:01,690
- Oh, well, actually, I
decided not to take anybody

950
00:44:01,691 --> 00:44:02,955
so nobody get mad at me.

951
00:44:04,724 --> 00:44:05,725
Didn't work, huh?

952
00:44:06,532 --> 00:44:07,533
- I'm not mad.

953
00:44:09,318 --> 00:44:11,329
But I've decided if
you're not serious enough

954
00:44:11,330 --> 00:44:12,692
to take me to the prom

955
00:44:13,612 --> 00:44:16,288
then I shouldn't consider
you in my future plans.

956
00:44:21,901 --> 00:44:23,942
I'm gonna go for it, Archie.

957
00:44:23,943 --> 00:44:26,044
Try and be a writer.

958
00:44:26,045 --> 00:44:28,998
There's a great program up
north that has a summer session.

959
00:44:31,691 --> 00:44:35,646
I'm leaving Riverdale
the day after graduation.

960
00:44:35,647 --> 00:44:37,139
- Why didn't you tell me?

961
00:44:38,958 --> 00:44:41,269
- We'd all assume that we'd
go to Riverdale Community

962
00:44:41,270 --> 00:44:42,972
and it'd be just like high school.

963
00:44:44,243 --> 00:44:47,485
I don't want college to
be just like high school.

964
00:44:47,486 --> 00:44:49,347
- Yeah, see, I thought-

965
00:44:49,348 --> 00:44:51,329
- That I'd stick around three more years

966
00:44:51,330 --> 00:44:53,435
until you got sick of chasing Veronica.

967
00:44:57,817 --> 00:44:59,381
Don't look so upset, Archie.

968
00:45:00,820 --> 00:45:02,715
I'm just making your choice for you.

969
00:45:03,913 --> 00:45:08,918
- Betty, I don't want you to go.

970
00:45:10,385 --> 00:45:13,722
(gentle brooding music)

971
00:45:16,255 --> 00:45:19,108
- I'm sure you'll learn how
to make up your mind one day.

972
00:45:21,420 --> 00:45:22,895
I just can't wait that long.

973
00:45:24,543 --> 00:45:25,544
- You're not a fool.

974
00:45:31,841 --> 00:45:35,177
Ever since we talked about
the night of the storm,

975
00:45:36,405 --> 00:45:39,538
I felt regret

976
00:45:41,720 --> 00:45:45,237
that we didn't, you know?

977
00:45:47,237 --> 00:45:51,900
- I felt it too.

978
00:45:51,901 --> 00:45:53,202
What's the matter with us?

979
00:45:54,723 --> 00:45:55,868
- It's just nostalgia.

980
00:45:58,898 --> 00:45:59,899
- You sure?

981
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:02,291
- Well, it has to be.

982
00:46:03,252 --> 00:46:06,919
I mean we're both in
love with other people.

983
00:46:10,009 --> 00:46:13,465
It's just natural to feel this way.

984
00:46:15,557 --> 00:46:17,059
But it's not real.

985
00:46:22,757 --> 00:46:24,146
- Archie.

986
00:46:24,147 --> 00:46:25,148
- Yeah.

987
00:46:29,265 --> 00:46:31,757
- Thank you for helping
me figure this out.

988
00:46:34,793 --> 00:46:37,961
I feel much better now.

989
00:46:37,962 --> 00:46:40,631
(Betty panting)

990
00:46:46,146 --> 00:46:49,114
(Archie gasps)
(gentle romantic music)

991
00:46:49,115 --> 00:46:51,534
(head thuds)

992
00:46:58,435 --> 00:47:00,206
(group chattering)
(birds chirping)

993
00:47:00,207 --> 00:47:01,959
- Hey guys, let's go.

994
00:47:06,855 --> 00:47:10,324
- I think Archie's got women troubles.

995
00:47:10,325 --> 00:47:12,127
- Do they make muzzles for children?

996
00:47:13,924 --> 00:47:16,314
(car door clicks)
(car door bangs)

997
00:47:16,315 --> 00:47:19,151
(fart squelching)

998
00:47:20,777 --> 00:47:21,611
Why you.
- Archie,

999
00:47:21,611 --> 00:47:22,501
he's just a little boy.

1000
00:47:22,502 --> 00:47:24,868
- Yeah, I'm just a little boy.

1001
00:47:24,869 --> 00:47:29,728
(ominous music)
(crow cawing)

1002
00:47:29,729 --> 00:47:32,170
(car engine revving)

1003
00:47:32,171 --> 00:47:33,321
(car engine roaring)

1004
00:47:33,322 --> 00:47:34,224
- [Archie] We're off.

1005
00:47:34,225 --> 00:47:36,809
(handle thuds)

1006
00:47:38,238 --> 00:47:39,707
(engine roaring)
(tires screeching)

1007
00:47:39,708 --> 00:47:43,780
- [Jughead] Oh, oh, gee,
Archie, car's running great.

1008
00:47:43,781 --> 00:47:45,931
(car horn honking)

1009
00:47:45,932 --> 00:47:47,183
- Brakes are off!

1010
00:47:47,184 --> 00:47:48,666
- Turn it off, turn it off!

1011
00:47:48,667 --> 00:47:49,501
Whoa!

1012
00:47:49,502 --> 00:47:51,620
(key clicks)

1013
00:47:51,621 --> 00:47:54,858
(group screaming)

1014
00:47:54,859 --> 00:47:56,417
(car horn honking)

1015
00:47:56,418 --> 00:47:58,236
- Get out of the way!

1016
00:47:58,237 --> 00:47:59,869
(tires screeching)
(horn honking)

1017
00:47:59,870 --> 00:48:01,583
- Oh, oh, oh, oh!

1018
00:48:01,584 --> 00:48:03,059
Get down!

1019
00:48:03,060 --> 00:48:06,147
(horn honking)
(Jughead screaming)

1020
00:48:06,148 --> 00:48:07,451
(horn honking)

1021
00:48:07,452 --> 00:48:08,453
Watch out!

1022
00:48:09,892 --> 00:48:12,939
(fence thudding)

1023
00:48:12,940 --> 00:48:15,639
(Jughead grunting)

1024
00:48:15,640 --> 00:48:18,050
(trash cans thudding)

1025
00:48:18,051 --> 00:48:19,284
(mailbox thuds)

1026
00:48:19,285 --> 00:48:22,121
(Jughead yelling)

1027
00:48:23,446 --> 00:48:24,821
(tires screeching)
(horn honking)

1028
00:48:24,822 --> 00:48:25,932
We're gonna die!

1029
00:48:25,933 --> 00:48:27,400
(horn honking)

1030
00:48:27,401 --> 00:48:29,290
(both screaming)

1031
00:48:29,291 --> 00:48:30,582
- Hi, Mr. Wilson.

1032
00:48:30,583 --> 00:48:32,025
(wood thudding)

1033
00:48:32,026 --> 00:48:34,946
(Archie screaming)

1034
00:48:36,452 --> 00:48:39,038
(horn honking)

1035
00:48:41,310 --> 00:48:43,184
(tires screeching)

1036
00:48:43,185 --> 00:48:45,790
(car horn honking)

1037
00:48:45,791 --> 00:48:48,151
(Archie yelling)

1038
00:48:48,152 --> 00:48:50,904
(metal thudding)

1039
00:48:53,239 --> 00:48:55,036
(tires screeching)

1040
00:48:55,037 --> 00:48:57,872
(crates thudding)

1041
00:48:58,817 --> 00:49:01,711
(crates thudding)

1042
00:49:01,712 --> 00:49:02,713
Whoa!

1043
00:49:05,022 --> 00:49:06,104
(table thudding)

1044
00:49:06,105 --> 00:49:08,125
Sorry, my fault!

1045
00:49:08,126 --> 00:49:09,359
(body thuds)

1046
00:49:09,360 --> 00:49:11,444
(glass thuds)
(Jughead grunting)

1047
00:49:11,445 --> 00:49:12,423
(wood thudding)

1048
00:49:12,424 --> 00:49:14,592
(water splashing)

1049
00:49:14,593 --> 00:49:17,237
- I say we go back to the
market and get some croutons.

1050
00:49:17,238 --> 00:49:18,971
Oh!

1051
00:49:18,972 --> 00:49:21,985
(car thuds)

1052
00:49:21,986 --> 00:49:24,283
(Archie screaming)

1053
00:49:24,284 --> 00:49:25,679
(car thuds)

1054
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,689
(dramatic music)

1055
00:49:26,690 --> 00:49:29,610
(glass shattering)

1056
00:49:31,429 --> 00:49:35,266
(Archie and Jughead grunting)

1057
00:49:36,175 --> 00:49:38,621
Whoa.
- Well, everybody Okay?

1058
00:49:38,622 --> 00:49:40,761
(hands clap)

1059
00:49:40,762 --> 00:49:41,763
- Hey, hey, my man.

1060
00:49:43,508 --> 00:49:45,177
- [Archie] Fun, huh?

1061
00:49:46,133 --> 00:49:48,221
(traffic humming)
(birds chirping)

1062
00:49:48,222 --> 00:49:49,606
(police radio chattering)

1063
00:49:49,607 --> 00:49:51,779
(phone ringing)

1064
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,881
- Ah, nah, da, da, da,

1065
00:49:53,882 --> 00:49:55,263
- Fancy seeing you here, Your Honor.

1066
00:49:55,264 --> 00:49:59,467
- I'm here on my weekend,
Mr. Andrews to set your bail.

1067
00:49:59,468 --> 00:50:01,689
- Thanks, I guess.

1068
00:50:01,690 --> 00:50:04,422
There are other ways to stop this eviction

1069
00:50:04,423 --> 00:50:06,644
short of ramming your car into buildings.

1070
00:50:06,645 --> 00:50:09,197
- Oh no, that was an
accident, Your Honor, I swear.

1071
00:50:09,198 --> 00:50:11,389
And I'm sorry if I've ruined your weekend.

1072
00:50:11,390 --> 00:50:15,803
- I admire your zeal, Mr.
Andrews, if not your methods.

1073
00:50:15,804 --> 00:50:20,098
I, I don't want this conflict
moving into the streets.

1074
00:50:20,099 --> 00:50:22,050
- Yes, sir.
- Call the parties together.

1075
00:50:22,051 --> 00:50:23,023
You've got your hearing.

1076
00:50:23,024 --> 00:50:24,145
- Oh, thank you, Your Honor.

1077
00:50:25,631 --> 00:50:27,965
(gavel banging)

1078
00:50:27,966 --> 00:50:30,007
- This is a municipal hearing.

1079
00:50:30,008 --> 00:50:31,269
It's not a trial.

1080
00:50:31,270 --> 00:50:33,731
And my verdict is final.

1081
00:50:33,732 --> 00:50:37,365
I asked that both parties
make their cases brief.

1082
00:50:37,366 --> 00:50:38,367
Mr. Mantel.

1083
00:50:39,348 --> 00:50:40,998
- It's simple, Your Honor.

1084
00:50:40,999 --> 00:50:43,191
Pop Tate's lease is oral.

1085
00:50:43,192 --> 00:50:46,284
According to the code I can
terminate it at any time.

1086
00:50:46,285 --> 00:50:47,286
This is the title.

1087
00:50:50,099 --> 00:50:53,795
- Well, now there's a
problem here, Mr. Mantle.

1088
00:50:55,864 --> 00:50:58,266
You're not the sole owner of the property.

1089
00:50:58,267 --> 00:51:03,272
In fact, you're in a minority
position to Lodge Industries.

1090
00:51:07,396 --> 00:51:11,213
- Hyrum Lodge's written
authorization for eviction.

1091
00:51:16,315 --> 00:51:17,905
- [Judge Brown] Well, everything seems-

1092
00:51:17,906 --> 00:51:21,243
- Miller versus Riverdale 1953.

1093
00:51:22,231 --> 00:51:24,512
Miller sued to stop
eviction from his residence

1094
00:51:24,513 --> 00:51:26,524
claiming landmark status for his house.

1095
00:51:26,525 --> 00:51:28,055
Status was granted.

1096
00:51:28,056 --> 00:51:30,037
The plaintiff was never evicted.

1097
00:51:30,038 --> 00:51:35,043
And the house in question is
what we all now fondly know

1098
00:51:36,135 --> 00:51:39,227
as Riverdale Highs Field House.

1099
00:51:39,228 --> 00:51:41,303
- Gotcha, you snake.

1100
00:51:42,141 --> 00:51:43,551
- Order please.

1101
00:51:43,552 --> 00:51:47,725
Mr. Tate's store is a commercial property.

1102
00:51:47,726 --> 00:51:50,998
And you and I both well know
that the landmark statute

1103
00:51:50,999 --> 00:51:52,680
clearly does not apply here.

1104
00:51:52,681 --> 00:51:53,915
It's a nice try, son.

1105
00:51:55,954 --> 00:51:57,575
Well, then I-

1106
00:51:57,576 --> 00:52:00,492
- Your Honor, may I make a statement?

1107
00:52:04,963 --> 00:52:06,284
Pop Tate's Chocolate Shop

1108
00:52:06,285 --> 00:52:07,935
is more than just an ice cream store,

1109
00:52:07,936 --> 00:52:10,218
it's a piece of our lives.

1110
00:52:10,219 --> 00:52:12,200
Now what kind of a town
is Riverdale going to be

1111
00:52:12,201 --> 00:52:14,962
if a greedy ego maniac like Reggie

1112
00:52:14,963 --> 00:52:16,824
is allowed to kick an old man around?

1113
00:52:16,825 --> 00:52:19,257
- Yeah, right.

1114
00:52:19,258 --> 00:52:21,689
- I'd like to confirm that, Your Honor.

1115
00:52:21,690 --> 00:52:25,022
Reggie is and always has
been a greedy ego maniac.

1116
00:52:25,023 --> 00:52:27,935
- Yeah, well, you're a
space cadet weirdo flake.

1117
00:52:27,936 --> 00:52:29,106
- Leave him alone!

1118
00:52:29,107 --> 00:52:30,108
- Make me.

1119
00:52:31,270 --> 00:52:32,103
- I'll make you.

1120
00:52:32,104 --> 00:52:33,641
- Get him Moose.
- Oh, come on, Moose,

1121
00:52:33,642 --> 00:52:34,513
you're so dumb you wouldn't know

1122
00:52:34,514 --> 00:52:35,983
if a brick hits you in the head.

1123
00:52:35,984 --> 00:52:37,965
- Well, you have a brick for a heart.

1124
00:52:37,966 --> 00:52:38,800
- Honey.

1125
00:52:38,800 --> 00:52:39,648
- Oh, what's the matter, Betty?

1126
00:52:39,649 --> 00:52:41,599
You upset 'cause nobody's
dipped your pigtails

1127
00:52:41,600 --> 00:52:42,770
in an ink well lately?

1128
00:52:42,771 --> 00:52:43,605
- Hey.

1129
00:52:43,606 --> 00:52:44,722
- Order.

1130
00:52:44,723 --> 00:52:46,198
You're acting like children.

1131
00:52:50,669 --> 00:52:52,860
- If Reggie evicts Pops, well then he,

1132
00:52:52,861 --> 00:52:55,864
he might as well just throw our
souls away while he's at it.

1133
00:52:57,936 --> 00:53:02,290
Your Honor, this courtroom
is filled with people

1134
00:53:02,291 --> 00:53:05,086
who were raised in and by Riverdale,

1135
00:53:06,705 --> 00:53:11,363
who are filled with its
values and its spirit.

1136
00:53:13,702 --> 00:53:17,064
If I stayed here this
long for any one reason,

1137
00:53:17,065 --> 00:53:20,732
it's because a place like
Pops can still exist.

1138
00:53:22,891 --> 00:53:25,653
Places that can't be
put on a balance sheet

1139
00:53:25,654 --> 00:53:27,909
or, or even into words.

1140
00:53:29,618 --> 00:53:33,371
Your Honor, I have no more cases to cite.

1141
00:53:33,372 --> 00:53:35,927
No more legal tactics.

1142
00:53:36,825 --> 00:53:40,342
But please don't let Reggie kick Pops out.

1143
00:53:41,750 --> 00:53:46,047
It'll diminish our town
and it'll break our hearts.

1144
00:53:46,933 --> 00:53:49,235
(group clapping)

1145
00:53:49,236 --> 00:53:52,155
(group chattering)

1146
00:53:53,191 --> 00:53:54,025
- Order.

1147
00:53:54,026 --> 00:53:58,059
This is the most unconventional case.

1148
00:53:59,558 --> 00:54:01,299
It requires further study.

1149
00:54:01,300 --> 00:54:04,272
I'll render my verdict tomorrow morning.

1150
00:54:04,273 --> 00:54:06,013
- Does that mean we gotta
come back here tomorrow?

1151
00:54:06,014 --> 00:54:08,476
- Tomorrow morning wake me up at six.

1152
00:54:08,477 --> 00:54:11,397
(group chattering)

1153
00:54:13,642 --> 00:54:16,254
- Didn't what he said get to you?

1154
00:54:16,255 --> 00:54:18,266
- Well, I've seen lawyers preach before.

1155
00:54:18,267 --> 00:54:20,011
Frankly, I've seen better.

1156
00:54:21,690 --> 00:54:22,691
- You're jealous.

1157
00:54:23,612 --> 00:54:25,249
- Well, if I am, it's only natural.

1158
00:54:25,250 --> 00:54:27,455
I mean as natural as you coming back here

1159
00:54:27,456 --> 00:54:29,308
and thinking all this really matters.

1160
00:54:31,690 --> 00:54:33,341
- We'll be back in Midvale in two days

1161
00:54:33,342 --> 00:54:34,366
so I'll let this go.

1162
00:54:35,594 --> 00:54:36,854
But I want you to promise me

1163
00:54:36,855 --> 00:54:40,312
not to insult what I think
is important or Archie.

1164
00:54:42,230 --> 00:54:44,374
You're my boyfriend,

1165
00:54:44,375 --> 00:54:45,926
but he's still important to me.

1166
00:54:50,381 --> 00:54:52,966
(Robert sighs)

1167
00:54:55,003 --> 00:54:57,154
- You can't do this to Pops.

1168
00:54:57,155 --> 00:54:58,026
If mother were here she'd-

1169
00:54:58,027 --> 00:54:59,797
- She'd mind her manners.

1170
00:54:59,798 --> 00:55:02,079
This is business, Veronica.

1171
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:03,433
I'm very busy at the moment.

1172
00:55:03,434 --> 00:55:04,333
Oh, thank you, Smithers.

1173
00:55:04,334 --> 00:55:06,084
- You're always busy.

1174
00:55:07,065 --> 00:55:09,801
- Veronica, you're my
only child and I love you.

1175
00:55:10,639 --> 00:55:12,560
You can imagine what my
life would've been like

1176
00:55:12,561 --> 00:55:15,533
if I had allowed your tantrums
to dictate my decisions.

1177
00:55:15,534 --> 00:55:16,465
Chaos.

1178
00:55:16,466 --> 00:55:17,969
- But Daddy.

1179
00:55:19,378 --> 00:55:22,246
- I won't budge on this,
Veronica, no matter how

1180
00:55:22,247 --> 00:55:23,161
(Veronica screams)

1181
00:55:23,162 --> 00:55:24,486
loudly you scream.

1182
00:55:28,537 --> 00:55:31,500
You're very angry with now,
but you'll get over it.

1183
00:55:31,501 --> 00:55:33,016
You always have.

1184
00:55:33,017 --> 00:55:34,049
(car engine humming)

1185
00:55:34,050 --> 00:55:36,381
(tires screeching)

1186
00:55:36,382 --> 00:55:37,752
(door clicks)

1187
00:55:37,753 --> 00:55:38,587
(birds chirping)

1188
00:55:38,588 --> 00:55:39,602
(door bangs)

1189
00:55:39,603 --> 00:55:42,268
(car door creaking)

1190
00:55:42,269 --> 00:55:44,151
(car door bangs)

1191
00:55:44,152 --> 00:55:45,236
- Donald Trump home?

1192
00:55:46,375 --> 00:55:47,425
Whoa.

1193
00:55:47,426 --> 00:55:48,746
I'll talk to him.

1194
00:55:48,747 --> 00:55:50,307
- He won't listen.

1195
00:55:50,308 --> 00:55:51,603
Just get me out of here.

1196
00:55:52,909 --> 00:55:55,013
(brooding music)

1197
00:55:55,014 --> 00:55:56,554
(car door clicks)

1198
00:55:56,555 --> 00:55:57,711
(car door clicks)
(door creaks)

1199
00:55:57,712 --> 00:56:00,465
(car door bangs)

1200
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:04,928
(car backfires)

1201
00:56:04,929 --> 00:56:07,064
- You were supposed to take care of this.

1202
00:56:07,065 --> 00:56:07,899
- I tried.

1203
00:56:07,899 --> 00:56:08,900
- Try harder.

1204
00:56:12,037 --> 00:56:13,332
(gentle music)

1205
00:56:13,333 --> 00:56:16,336
(car door creaking)

1206
00:56:18,116 --> 00:56:19,617
- I miss this place.

1207
00:56:19,618 --> 00:56:20,728
- Yeah.

1208
00:56:20,729 --> 00:56:22,319
- I miss how we used to come here

1209
00:56:22,320 --> 00:56:24,812
and talk about our problems.

1210
00:56:24,813 --> 00:56:27,215
Think about what we'd be
like in the the future.

1211
00:56:28,206 --> 00:56:30,702
You know, I can't blame my father.

1212
00:56:31,660 --> 00:56:36,013
All I've done my whole life is
go to clubs, spend his money,

1213
00:56:36,014 --> 00:56:38,016
and leave a trail of husbands behind me.

1214
00:56:39,528 --> 00:56:41,212
I found my Frenchman Archie,

1215
00:56:42,928 --> 00:56:45,056
and all I got for it was my heart broken.

1216
00:56:47,335 --> 00:56:48,750
Maybe I deserved it.

1217
00:56:51,214 --> 00:56:53,491
You know why I kept getting married?

1218
00:56:53,492 --> 00:56:55,803
Same reason people have 10 cats,

1219
00:56:55,804 --> 00:56:58,115
they always want a kitten around.

1220
00:56:58,116 --> 00:56:59,808
Only kittens become cats

1221
00:57:00,729 --> 00:57:03,791
and husbands become jerks
after the first anniversary.

1222
00:57:03,792 --> 00:57:04,966
- You know, Veronica,

1223
00:57:06,104 --> 00:57:08,106
you've always had everything you wanted.

1224
00:57:10,639 --> 00:57:15,086
Maybe it's been more of
a burden than a blessing.

1225
00:57:16,705 --> 00:57:18,757
- Like every other poor little rich girl.

1226
00:57:19,850 --> 00:57:24,095
- (sighs) Kiddo, it'll be okay.

1227
00:57:33,011 --> 00:57:34,012
Hi, Mr. Lodge.

1228
00:57:36,645 --> 00:57:37,999
Uh, Veronica.

1229
00:57:39,698 --> 00:57:41,212
- Kathy.

1230
00:57:41,213 --> 00:57:43,925
(door clicks)

1231
00:57:43,926 --> 00:57:46,345
(door bangs)

1232
00:57:54,813 --> 00:57:56,515
- You and I are going to the prom.

1233
00:57:57,696 --> 00:58:00,297
- Inviting me the morning before.

1234
00:58:00,298 --> 00:58:01,483
No thanks, Archie.

1235
00:58:05,143 --> 00:58:06,144
- You're packing.

1236
00:58:07,335 --> 00:58:09,707
- I'm off to Paris after graduation.

1237
00:58:09,708 --> 00:58:11,459
I'm going to college at the Serban.

1238
00:58:13,101 --> 00:58:14,902
- How can you go to France?

1239
00:58:14,903 --> 00:58:16,704
- My father's chartering a jet.

1240
00:58:16,705 --> 00:58:19,891
- No, no, I, I, I mean, I mean,
how can you leave Riverdale?

1241
00:58:21,660 --> 00:58:24,966
- It'll be hard to adjust, but
it's something I have to do.

1242
00:58:26,344 --> 00:58:28,690
Who knows maybe even you'll leave one day.

1243
00:58:29,828 --> 00:58:30,829
- I'll never leave.

1244
00:58:32,825 --> 00:58:34,796
(train horn honking)

1245
00:58:34,797 --> 00:58:35,631
- Look at this stuff.

1246
00:58:35,631 --> 00:58:36,632
This is great, isn't it?

1247
00:58:39,954 --> 00:58:42,243
This was your dad's place.

1248
00:58:43,732 --> 00:58:45,287
- Junkyard.

1249
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:48,720
- It's not just a junkyard,
it's our junkyard.

1250
00:58:50,278 --> 00:58:52,469
It's full of our ghosts.

1251
00:58:52,470 --> 00:58:53,611
- Ghosts.

1252
00:58:53,612 --> 00:58:55,807
Right, Dad, ghosts.

1253
00:58:57,849 --> 00:59:00,397
- He's a tough nut to crack, Arch.

1254
00:59:00,398 --> 00:59:01,650
Toughest I've ever known.

1255
00:59:02,951 --> 00:59:06,163
Now you've gotta choose Veronica or Pam.

1256
00:59:06,164 --> 00:59:07,484
- Or Betty.

1257
00:59:07,485 --> 00:59:09,737
- You've figured
everything out with Betty.

1258
00:59:09,738 --> 00:59:11,478
- No, I figured everything out for Betty.

1259
00:59:11,479 --> 00:59:13,893
It's me, I didn't convince.

1260
00:59:13,894 --> 00:59:15,683
- (sighs) How about we
throw the three of 'em

1261
00:59:15,684 --> 00:59:19,166
in a pit of mud and let 'em
fight it out for themselves?

1262
00:59:19,167 --> 00:59:21,693
Is that psychoanalysis at work or what?

1263
00:59:22,771 --> 00:59:24,091
- Or what?

1264
00:59:24,092 --> 00:59:26,017
- It'll still cost you $120.

1265
00:59:27,185 --> 00:59:29,076
- Now there's only one choice to make.

1266
00:59:29,077 --> 00:59:30,068
I love Pam.

1267
00:59:30,069 --> 00:59:32,079
I don't know what I'd do if I lost her.

1268
00:59:32,080 --> 00:59:33,911
- Divergent thinking, Arch,

1269
00:59:33,912 --> 00:59:36,362
what are you gonna do when
you lose Betty and Veronica?

1270
00:59:36,363 --> 00:59:40,501
(gentle brooding music)

1271
00:59:40,502 --> 00:59:43,821
(Archie sighs)

1272
00:59:43,822 --> 00:59:44,932
I know it's cold comfort,

1273
00:59:44,933 --> 00:59:47,094
but I always wished I could have been good

1274
00:59:47,095 --> 00:59:48,381
with women like you.

1275
00:59:48,382 --> 00:59:50,217
(Archie scoffs)

1276
00:59:50,218 --> 00:59:52,533
Instead of being afraid of them.

1277
00:59:53,551 --> 00:59:56,163
- Jughead, there's
nothing to be afraid of.

1278
00:59:56,164 --> 00:59:57,935
I mean, the worst they can do is

1279
00:59:57,936 --> 01:00:00,397
make your life a living hell.

1280
01:00:00,398 --> 01:00:01,448
- Check this out.

1281
01:00:01,449 --> 01:00:03,340
Signed by Hank Aaron.

1282
01:00:03,341 --> 01:00:04,272
- Where'd you get that?

1283
01:00:04,273 --> 01:00:06,343
- Jammed in this old jukebox.

1284
01:00:06,344 --> 01:00:08,175
- Oh, let's check it out.

1285
01:00:08,176 --> 01:00:09,177
- Wow.

1286
01:00:10,038 --> 01:00:11,089
- Where?
- This way.

1287
01:00:12,894 --> 01:00:14,812
- This is great.

1288
01:00:14,813 --> 01:00:17,274
- Hey, Jughead, look at this.

1289
01:00:17,275 --> 01:00:20,337
It's the one from the
gym, I can't believe it.

1290
01:00:20,338 --> 01:00:22,443
- Copies of the school newspaper.

1291
01:00:23,311 --> 01:00:24,996
Team uniforms.

1292
01:00:26,044 --> 01:00:27,005
An old steering wheel.

1293
01:00:27,006 --> 01:00:28,385
This could be from your jalopy.

1294
01:00:28,386 --> 01:00:30,007
- Could be.

1295
01:00:30,008 --> 01:00:31,365
Oh, hey, when was the last
time you saw one of theses?

1296
01:00:31,366 --> 01:00:33,918
You know, I should take
this as a souvenir.

1297
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:34,753
- Yeah.
- Oh, yeah?

1298
01:00:34,753 --> 01:00:35,622
Yeah.

1299
01:00:35,623 --> 01:00:37,170
- This'd be cool to have.

1300
01:00:37,171 --> 01:00:38,272
Look at this.

1301
01:00:38,273 --> 01:00:40,037
- Oh, and look.

1302
01:00:40,038 --> 01:00:42,541
Boy, they don't make these anymore.

1303
01:00:42,542 --> 01:00:44,746
- (laughing) This looks familiar.

1304
01:00:44,747 --> 01:00:46,434
(Jughead laughing)

1305
01:00:46,435 --> 01:00:48,690
- Man, we had great stuff.

1306
01:00:49,824 --> 01:00:52,409
- Ah, we had the best stuff.

1307
01:00:52,410 --> 01:00:54,295
- Why would anyone leave all this behind?

1308
01:00:55,503 --> 01:00:57,699
- Time makes people
kind of blind, I guess.

1309
01:01:00,504 --> 01:01:03,257
(birds chirping)

1310
01:01:11,873 --> 01:01:14,218
- Hey, hey, what is going on?

1311
01:01:14,219 --> 01:01:17,034
- Doing you a favor and
putting your things in storage.

1312
01:01:17,035 --> 01:01:18,175
That's what's going.

1313
01:01:18,176 --> 01:01:19,997
- We're moving in today, you knew that.

1314
01:01:19,998 --> 01:01:21,538
- On a Sunday?

1315
01:01:21,539 --> 01:01:24,121
- The 10th, Mr. Andrews today.

1316
01:01:24,122 --> 01:01:26,524
Looks like you'll have
to find yourself a motel.

Now that, uh.

1380
01:03:48,927 --> 01:03:50,217
- It was teamwork, Dad.

1381
01:03:50,218 --> 01:03:51,538
- Yo, give me five, my man.

1382
01:03:51,539 --> 01:03:52,530
- You were fresh, Jughead.

1383
01:03:52,531 --> 01:03:54,121
- Oh, you were styling too, my man.

1384
01:03:54,122 --> 01:03:55,412
Oh, did you see that move by busted?

1385
01:03:55,413 --> 01:03:56,340
- Yeah, I did.

1386
01:03:56,340 --> 01:03:57,174
- I was grooving.

1387
01:03:57,174 --> 01:03:58,008
Wasn't I grooving?
- Yeah.

1388
01:03:58,008 --> 01:03:58,842
(gavel banging)

1389
01:03:58,843 --> 01:04:00,942
- The case is troubling.

1390
01:04:02,260 --> 01:04:06,377
Mr. Mantle's claim clearly
carries the greater legal weight.

1391
01:04:07,725 --> 01:04:10,798
While Mr. Andrews presents a perspective

1392
01:04:12,620 --> 01:04:14,755
I find difficult to ignore.

1393
01:04:16,734 --> 01:04:19,106
I'd hope to engineer a compromise.

1394
01:04:19,107 --> 01:04:20,641
This proved impossible.

1395
01:04:22,680 --> 01:04:23,681
Mr. Andrews,

1396
01:04:25,023 --> 01:04:30,028
you presented your case
eloquently with honesty and heart.

1397
01:04:31,539 --> 01:04:33,010
But unfortunately this court

1398
01:04:33,011 --> 01:04:35,862
does not rule on humanity and compassion.

1399
01:04:35,863 --> 01:04:38,209
It enforces the letter of the law.

1400
01:04:39,137 --> 01:04:41,910
I must allow the eviction
to proceed as planned.

1401
01:04:41,911 --> 01:04:44,830
(group chattering)

1402
01:04:46,486 --> 01:04:50,894
(dog barking)
(birds chirping)

1403
01:04:50,895 --> 01:04:52,950
- Arch, Arch.

1404
01:04:52,951 --> 01:04:55,893
Listen, I'll talk to Lodge
about kicking Pops out.

1405
01:04:55,894 --> 01:04:58,239
Maybe I can convince
him it's bad business.

1406
01:04:59,317 --> 01:05:00,431
- After all this why?

1407
01:05:03,144 --> 01:05:05,713
- I, I got a confession to make,

1408
01:05:07,125 --> 01:05:11,088
when I saw Veronica again my knees locked.

1409
01:05:11,089 --> 01:05:14,211
Now listen, talk to her, turn
her down, and build me up.

1410
01:05:14,212 --> 01:05:15,622
I know you can't make any promises,

1411
01:05:15,623 --> 01:05:17,424
but I can't promise I can convince Lodge.

1412
01:05:17,425 --> 01:05:19,106
So it's a fair deal see.

1413
01:05:19,107 --> 01:05:21,628
- Reggie, has it, it ever occurred to you

1414
01:05:21,629 --> 01:05:24,425
that it's wrong to make
deals for human beings?

1415
01:05:25,503 --> 01:05:26,504
- No.

1416
01:05:27,755 --> 01:05:30,637
- Look, Veronica is her own person.

1417
01:05:30,638 --> 01:05:32,559
I have absolutely no influence over it.

1418
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:35,263
Now she knows I'm engaged
and she knows I'm moving so.

1419
01:05:39,080 --> 01:05:41,582
(dog barking)

1420
01:05:49,062 --> 01:05:51,808
(Archie gasps)

1421
01:05:51,809 --> 01:05:54,095
- Pops is history.

1422
01:05:55,605 --> 01:05:57,562
(gentle brooding music)

1423
01:05:57,563 --> 01:06:01,959
(door bangs)
(bell ringing)

1424
01:06:01,960 --> 01:06:03,490
- Let's have none of that.

1425
01:06:03,491 --> 01:06:04,811
I'm real proud of you Archie.

1426
01:06:04,812 --> 01:06:06,463
No man could have done better.

1427
01:06:06,464 --> 01:06:08,205
- Pops.
- Don't worry about me.

1428
01:06:08,206 --> 01:06:10,367
I just need you to do one thing.

1429
01:06:10,368 --> 01:06:11,359
- Anything.

1430
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:13,130
- Go and enjoy yourself.

1431
01:06:13,131 --> 01:06:14,992
Now I'm fine.

1432
01:06:14,993 --> 01:06:17,514
But if you let my problem
spoil your reunion,

1433
01:06:17,515 --> 01:06:19,286
I don't know how good I'll be.

1434
01:06:19,287 --> 01:06:20,288
Promise.

1435
01:06:22,650 --> 01:06:25,276
- What's good for the
kids is good for Pops.

1436
01:06:25,277 --> 01:06:26,328
- Now get outta here.

1437
01:06:30,788 --> 01:06:33,009
(door clicks)
(bell ringing)

1438
01:06:33,010 --> 01:06:38,015
(upbeat music)
(group chattering)

1439
01:06:43,731 --> 01:06:45,755
- In honor of our reunion,

1440
01:06:45,756 --> 01:06:49,586
management has given us
sole run of the park.

1441
01:06:49,587 --> 01:06:54,571
And lowered prices to what
they were 15 years ago.

1442
01:06:54,572 --> 01:06:55,896
Generous I'd say.

1443
01:06:57,065 --> 01:06:58,616
- Listen, I've got a good idea.

1444
01:06:59,527 --> 01:07:01,838
Let's tie Reggie to the
roller coaster tracks

1445
01:07:01,839 --> 01:07:03,920
and hand out all you can ride tickets.

1446
01:07:03,921 --> 01:07:05,172
(Jordan chuckles)

1447
01:07:05,173 --> 01:07:07,304
- You know that woman could be anywhere.

1448
01:07:07,305 --> 01:07:09,200
- Oh, face it, Jughead,

1449
01:07:10,338 --> 01:07:12,739
sooner or later you're
gonna run into Big Ethel.

1450
01:07:12,740 --> 01:07:14,424
What are you gonna do then?

1451
01:07:14,425 --> 01:07:17,450
(Jughead screaming)

1452
01:07:17,451 --> 01:07:18,925
- Ah, are you really scared, Dad?

1453
01:07:18,926 --> 01:07:20,254
- No screaming just makes it more fun.

1454
01:07:20,255 --> 01:07:21,089
Try it.

1455
01:07:21,090 --> 01:07:23,841
(both screaming)

1456
01:07:25,722 --> 01:07:28,808
- All contestants for Muppet car polo

1457
01:07:30,110 --> 01:07:33,190
join Coach Clayton on the track

1458
01:07:33,191 --> 01:07:35,258
for some good clean fun.

1459
01:07:35,259 --> 01:07:39,180
(slow tempo suspenseful music)

1460
01:08:04,152 --> 01:08:06,504
- Competition builds character.

1461
01:08:09,490 --> 01:08:13,104
Whoever gets the most
balls in their goal wins.

1462
01:08:14,182 --> 01:08:16,781
Okay, sportsmen and sports ladies.

1463
01:08:17,665 --> 01:08:18,666
Play ball.

1464
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:21,794
(whistle blowing)
(group cheering)

1465
01:08:21,795 --> 01:08:24,381
(upbeat music)

1466
01:08:30,823 --> 01:08:32,849
(balls thudding)

1467
01:08:32,850 --> 01:08:33,948
(tires screeching)

1468
01:08:33,949 --> 01:08:35,281
- Oh, oh, that's it.

1469
01:08:35,282 --> 01:08:37,534
Come on pal, let's get 'em!

1470
01:08:42,942 --> 01:08:44,651
(ball thuds)

1471
01:08:44,652 --> 01:08:45,653
Yes!

1472
01:08:50,107 --> 01:08:51,623
(Jughead cheering)

1473
01:08:51,624 --> 01:08:53,054
- This one's mine.

1474
01:08:53,055 --> 01:08:54,056
Yeah!

1475
01:08:58,512 --> 01:08:59,454
(broom thuds)

1476
01:08:59,455 --> 01:09:01,819
- Betty, take mine.

1477
01:09:01,820 --> 01:09:02,821
- Thanks.

1478
01:09:08,347 --> 01:09:09,668
- Why did he do that?

1479
01:09:09,669 --> 01:09:11,276
- He was being chivalrous.

1480
01:09:11,277 --> 01:09:12,110
(tires screech)

1481
01:09:12,110 --> 01:09:13,111
Whoo!

1482
01:09:15,927 --> 01:09:18,347
(ball thuds)

1483
01:09:19,440 --> 01:09:22,797
(balls thudding)

1484
01:09:22,798 --> 01:09:25,634
(Archie chuckles)

1485
01:09:27,027 --> 01:09:29,950
- Blow him another kiss and he dies.

1486
01:09:34,577 --> 01:09:36,763
(balls thudding)

1487
01:09:36,764 --> 01:09:37,765
- Hi, Betty.

1488
01:09:38,778 --> 01:09:40,070
- I got you Andrew!

1489
01:09:40,071 --> 01:09:41,407
(tires screech)

1490
01:09:41,408 --> 01:09:43,033
- We're gonna get you!

1491
01:09:43,034 --> 01:09:46,820
- [Coach Clayton] Sportsmanship
gentlemen, sportsmanship.

1492
01:09:46,821 --> 01:09:48,688
- You blew him a kiss.

1493
01:09:48,689 --> 01:09:50,475
(balls thudding)

1494
01:09:50,476 --> 01:09:52,755
(tires screeching)

1495
01:09:52,756 --> 01:09:54,093
I'm gonna get you!

1496
01:09:54,094 --> 01:09:55,571
(tires screeching)

1497
01:09:55,572 --> 01:09:56,573
- Whoo!

1498
01:10:00,189 --> 01:10:03,172
(tires screeching)

1499
01:10:03,173 --> 01:10:04,900
(cars thudding)

1500
01:10:04,901 --> 01:10:06,605
(car crashing)

1501
01:10:06,606 --> 01:10:07,774
(dramatic music)

1502
01:10:07,775 --> 01:10:09,393
- [Reggie and Robert] Yeah!

1503
01:10:09,394 --> 01:10:11,667
- [Coach Clayton] Stop
the game, stop the game!

1504
01:10:11,668 --> 01:10:14,504
(Archie groaning)

1505
01:10:24,942 --> 01:10:25,903
- Archie.

1506
01:10:25,903 --> 01:10:26,904
- Oh.

1507
01:10:31,107 --> 01:10:32,108
Wow.

1508
01:10:33,664 --> 01:10:35,651
I'm fine.
- Help him out.

1509
01:10:35,652 --> 01:10:36,770
(Veronica gasping)
(Archie groaning)

1510
01:10:36,771 --> 01:10:38,519
- Oh, my neck.

1511
01:10:38,520 --> 01:10:39,521
Oh.

1512
01:10:40,398 --> 01:10:42,108
- [Betty and Veronica] Are you all right?

1513
01:10:42,109 --> 01:10:43,880
- Who hit me?

1514
01:10:43,881 --> 01:10:44,842
- Reggie.

1515
01:10:44,843 --> 01:10:46,313
- And Robert.

1516
01:10:46,314 --> 01:10:47,245
- [Archie] Carry me over there.

1517
01:10:47,246 --> 01:10:48,272
Let me at 'em.

1518
01:10:48,273 --> 01:10:49,514
(Archie groaning)

1519
01:10:49,515 --> 01:10:51,517
- [Veronica] No, no, no.

1520
01:10:52,710 --> 01:10:54,080
- Hey, hey.

1521
01:10:54,081 --> 01:10:55,962
Get outta here.

1522
01:10:55,963 --> 01:10:58,349
- Oh, no, Moose, Moose.

1523
01:10:58,350 --> 01:10:59,398
No, Moose.

1524
01:10:59,399 --> 01:11:02,138
(Archie groaning)

1525
01:11:02,139 --> 01:11:04,018
- This hurt?
- Yeah.

1526
01:11:04,019 --> 01:11:05,322
- This?
- Ah, yeah.

1527
01:11:05,323 --> 01:11:06,996
Uh-huh, uh-huh.

1528
01:11:06,997 --> 01:11:07,831
- Here.

1529
01:11:07,832 --> 01:11:10,307
(group gasping)

1530
01:11:10,308 --> 01:11:11,309
Hold on.

1531
01:11:12,590 --> 01:11:15,096
- No! (screaming)

1532
01:11:15,097 --> 01:11:18,355
(Archie groaning)

1533
01:11:18,356 --> 01:11:20,307
Oh, huh.

1534
01:11:20,308 --> 01:11:21,141
- [Moose] How's that?

1535
01:11:21,142 --> 01:11:22,289
- That's-
- Better?

1536
01:11:22,290 --> 01:11:23,940
- That's, that's pretty good.

1537
01:11:23,941 --> 01:11:27,003
Oh, yeah.

1538
01:11:27,004 --> 01:11:28,061
- I'll go get your car.

1539
01:11:28,062 --> 01:11:29,155
- Okay.

1540
01:11:29,156 --> 01:11:34,161
(group cheering)
(group clapping)

1541
01:11:36,193 --> 01:11:37,154
- [Jordan] Dad, Archie?

1542
01:11:37,155 --> 01:11:38,174
- Oh, he's gonna be okay.

1543
01:11:38,175 --> 01:11:39,109
Everything's okay.

1544
01:11:39,110 --> 01:11:40,679
- Oh, Jughead.

1545
01:11:40,680 --> 01:11:42,454
Someone was looking for you.

1546
01:11:42,455 --> 01:11:43,620
Eva Mugg said, "That if you two

1547
01:11:43,621 --> 01:11:45,410
could just get together on the."

1548
01:11:49,764 --> 01:11:51,027
- For a moment there

1549
01:11:51,028 --> 01:11:53,069
I thought you might not
be able to sing tonight.

1550
01:11:53,070 --> 01:11:54,541
- Oh, now Mr. Weatherbee about-

1551
01:11:54,542 --> 01:11:55,832
- I'll meet you at your motel.

1552
01:11:55,833 --> 01:11:56,853
- Now listen ladies,

1553
01:11:56,854 --> 01:11:59,135
you aren't gonna let me
down tonight, are you?

1554
01:11:59,136 --> 01:12:00,701
- I'll play if Archie does.

1555
01:12:02,920 --> 01:12:06,162
- It's a sport, you do
whatever you have to do to win.

1556
01:12:06,163 --> 01:12:08,765
- You were being a jerk.

1557
01:12:08,766 --> 01:12:10,130
- (scoffs) I was a jerk?

1558
01:12:11,088 --> 01:12:13,099
Who lost his case?

1559
01:12:13,100 --> 01:12:14,811
- What's the matter with you?

1560
01:12:14,812 --> 01:12:17,266
Where is the man I came
to the reunion with?

1561
01:12:17,267 --> 01:12:19,105
- (scoffs) Well, I
haven't changed my tune.

1562
01:12:19,106 --> 01:12:21,418
- That's right, you haven't.

1563
01:12:21,419 --> 01:12:23,400
- And when this ridiculous
reunion is over,

1564
01:12:23,401 --> 01:12:25,102
it's me you're gonna be left with.

1565
01:12:26,464 --> 01:12:28,165
Maybe you better think about that.

1566
01:12:29,256 --> 01:12:30,257
- Maybe I'd better.

1567
01:12:33,082 --> 01:12:35,668
(Robert sighs)

1568
01:12:38,536 --> 01:12:40,186
- Ronnie, it would never work.

1569
01:12:40,187 --> 01:12:41,448
I mean, what would you do,

1570
01:12:41,449 --> 01:12:42,833
move to the city with me?

1571
01:12:43,971 --> 01:12:45,623
No, that's exactly what she'd do.

1572
01:12:46,944 --> 01:12:50,188
Ronnie, I made a commitment
to Pam and I feel as a man.

1573
01:12:50,189 --> 01:12:53,109
(knuckles tapping)

1574
01:12:56,235 --> 01:12:57,544
(door clicks)

1575
01:12:57,545 --> 01:13:00,798
(upbeat playful music)

1576
01:13:02,019 --> 01:13:03,163
- My latest story.

1577
01:13:07,815 --> 01:13:09,199
I just finished it.

1578
01:13:13,220 --> 01:13:15,081
- I looked up from the dark wet sand

1579
01:13:15,082 --> 01:13:17,634
and saw the fire and designs.

1580
01:13:17,635 --> 01:13:20,438
I didn't know about my mind,
but my body was telling me,

1581
01:13:22,251 --> 01:13:23,252
Betty.

1582
01:13:24,542 --> 01:13:27,037
- I never forgot the night
of the storm, Archie.

1583
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:30,427
And I never forgot the way I stood by

1584
01:13:30,428 --> 01:13:32,653
and watched while you
chased after Veronica.

1585
01:13:33,581 --> 01:13:36,196
How I never just went after what I wanted.

1586
01:13:39,623 --> 01:13:41,568
(door clicks)

1587
01:13:41,569 --> 01:13:42,620
- What are you doing?

1588
01:13:44,452 --> 01:13:47,544
- Something I always want
to do with you, Archie.

1589
01:13:47,545 --> 01:13:49,856
I'm sick of being Miss Goody Two-Shoes.

1590
01:13:49,857 --> 01:13:51,602
Treat me like a woman, Archie.

1591
01:13:52,530 --> 01:13:55,411
Make me wild.

1592
01:13:55,412 --> 01:13:56,977
- Now let's not be rash.

1593
01:13:58,091 --> 01:13:59,976
(car door clicks)

1594
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:01,078
How about that shower?

1595
01:14:02,259 --> 01:14:03,464
- How about it?

1596
01:14:07,151 --> 01:14:08,284
- Be in in a sec.

1597
01:14:08,285 --> 01:14:11,996
(door bangs)
(knuckles tapping)

1598
01:14:11,997 --> 01:14:13,926
(door clicks)

1599
01:14:13,927 --> 01:14:17,097
(upbeat sultry music)

1600
01:14:18,626 --> 01:14:20,641
- Archie, you're amazing.

1601
01:14:21,629 --> 01:14:24,004
How did you know that
was one of my fantasies?

1602
01:14:25,473 --> 01:14:26,474
Let's get wet.

1603
01:14:28,741 --> 01:14:29,742
- Uh, no!

1604
01:14:30,611 --> 01:14:32,288
- No?
- No, I was just, uh,

1605
01:14:32,289 --> 01:14:36,012
just gonna steam my suit, uh,
for the party tonight frankly.

1606
01:14:36,013 --> 01:14:36,847
- I'll do it.

1607
01:14:36,848 --> 01:14:38,384
- Nope, not gonna wear it just decided.

1608
01:14:38,385 --> 01:14:39,586
- Well, let's see what else you've got.

1609
01:14:39,587 --> 01:14:41,198
How about?

1610
01:14:41,199 --> 01:14:42,318
(door bangs)

1611
01:14:42,319 --> 01:14:43,224
- Coming?

1612
01:14:43,225 --> 01:14:45,267
- (chuckles) Uh, you bet, uh-huh.

1613
01:14:45,268 --> 01:14:46,432
- When?

1614
01:14:46,433 --> 01:14:47,784
- Any second now.

1615
01:14:47,785 --> 01:14:48,746
- I'll be waving.

1616
01:14:48,746 --> 01:14:49,747
- Okay.

1617
01:14:50,665 --> 01:14:51,499
(door bangs)
(playful music)

1618
01:14:51,500 --> 01:14:52,713
Slip fell against the door.

1619
01:14:53,790 --> 01:14:55,164
- And you held it closed.

1620
01:14:55,165 --> 01:14:56,707
Who are you speaking to?

1621
01:14:56,708 --> 01:14:59,105
(knuckles tapping)

1622
01:14:59,106 --> 01:15:00,655
Aren't you gonna see who it is?

1623
01:15:00,656 --> 01:15:01,815
- Who what is?

1624
01:15:01,816 --> 01:15:02,889
(knuckles tapping)

1625
01:15:02,890 --> 01:15:04,269
- Someone knocked on the door.

1626
01:15:04,270 --> 01:15:05,104
(knuckles tapping)

1627
01:15:05,105 --> 01:15:06,605
See.
- You're right.

1628
01:15:06,606 --> 01:15:09,025
(door bangs)

1629
01:15:12,808 --> 01:15:14,000
(door clicks)

1630
01:15:14,001 --> 01:15:15,579
- Surprise.

1631
01:15:15,580 --> 01:15:18,328
- (gasps) Surprise.

1632
01:15:19,614 --> 01:15:20,908
(door bangs)

1633
01:15:20,909 --> 01:15:23,216
- (giggles) Are you happy to see me?

1634
01:15:23,217 --> 01:15:24,091
- Oh, you bet.

1635
01:15:24,092 --> 01:15:25,532
Very happy.

1636
01:15:25,533 --> 01:15:28,441
- Uh, are, are we in a
rush to get somewhere?

1637
01:15:28,442 --> 01:15:29,638
- No, no.

1638
01:15:29,639 --> 01:15:31,346
(car engine roaring)
(tires screeching)

1639
01:15:31,347 --> 01:15:33,850
(door clicks)

1640
01:15:35,081 --> 01:15:38,084
(knuckles pounding)

1641
01:15:40,148 --> 01:15:41,829
(knuckles pounding)

1642
01:15:41,830 --> 01:15:43,099
(Betty screams)

1643
01:15:43,100 --> 01:15:44,571
- What are you doing here?

1644
01:15:44,572 --> 01:15:47,432
- I was about to ask
you the same question.

1645
01:15:47,433 --> 01:15:50,332
(Veronica gasps)

1646
01:15:50,333 --> 01:15:51,928
(gentle dramatic music)

1647
01:15:51,929 --> 01:15:54,000
- I think we need to talk.

1648
01:15:54,001 --> 01:15:56,763
- I'm sorry, I know I've been
really bad about calling.

1649
01:15:56,764 --> 01:16:01,031
But it, it's like, suddenly I
have all these best friends.

1650
01:16:03,430 --> 01:16:04,995
- I hate you!

1651
01:16:08,596 --> 01:16:09,597
- I see.

1652
01:16:11,646 --> 01:16:14,398
- Either I'm seeing things
or that's babe number three.

1653
01:16:15,472 --> 01:16:16,763
- You get this sneaky feeling

1654
01:16:16,764 --> 01:16:19,285
that geeky knows something we don't?

1655
01:16:19,286 --> 01:16:21,147
- Reggie was trying to force Pops out

1656
01:16:21,148 --> 01:16:22,799
and it looked like it was gonna happen

1657
01:16:22,800 --> 01:16:25,772
until finally I got the judge

1658
01:16:25,773 --> 01:16:27,153
to convene the court over the weekend.

1659
01:16:27,154 --> 01:16:29,650
But then I lost.

1660
01:16:30,702 --> 01:16:32,348
- I'm sorry.

1661
01:16:32,349 --> 01:16:33,760
Can't he move someplace else?

1662
01:16:33,761 --> 01:16:35,501
- No, honey, that's not the point.

1663
01:16:35,502 --> 01:16:38,448
You see, this place is special.

1664
01:16:40,668 --> 01:16:41,969
- It's an ice cream store.

1665
01:16:44,194 --> 01:16:45,922
(door bangs)

1666
01:16:45,923 --> 01:16:48,021
- Arch, Betty and Veronica
are looking for you.

1667
01:16:48,022 --> 01:16:51,898
- Uh, honey, this is Jughead and Jordan.

1668
01:16:51,899 --> 01:16:54,424
Guys, this is Pam.

1669
01:16:57,364 --> 01:16:58,835
- Oh, hi.

1670
01:16:58,836 --> 01:17:00,216
- Hi.

1671
01:17:00,217 --> 01:17:02,592
- Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

1672
01:17:04,391 --> 01:17:06,342
- Well, we're going to find Big Ethel.

1673
01:17:06,343 --> 01:17:08,474
I decided it'd be a good first step

1674
01:17:08,475 --> 01:17:10,697
in conquering my fear of women.

1675
01:17:10,698 --> 01:17:11,699
- Wow.
- Yeah.

1676
01:17:12,482 --> 01:17:13,984
Ah, okay, bye-Bye.

1677
01:17:15,683 --> 01:17:18,574
(door clicks)
(bell ringing)

1678
01:17:18,575 --> 01:17:20,549
(door bangs)

1679
01:17:20,550 --> 01:17:22,036
- What a strange pair.

1680
01:17:22,037 --> 01:17:24,790
(birds chirping)

1681
01:17:26,767 --> 01:17:28,964
(knuckles tapping)

1682
01:17:28,965 --> 01:17:32,044
(Jughead sighs)

1683
01:17:32,045 --> 01:17:34,270
(door clicks)

1684
01:17:34,271 --> 01:17:35,561
- [Jughead] Oh, Ms. Muggs, hi.

1685
01:17:35,562 --> 01:17:37,395
Is Ethel home?

1686
01:17:37,396 --> 01:17:38,397
- Jughead.

1687
01:17:39,106 --> 01:17:41,301
Oh, she'll be so happy to see you.

1688
01:17:44,384 --> 01:17:45,385
- Ah.

1689
01:17:46,594 --> 01:17:48,248
(Jughead sighs)

1690
01:17:48,249 --> 01:17:51,252
(Jughead whistling)

1691
01:17:54,391 --> 01:17:56,943
Well, I guess she's not home so.

1692
01:17:56,944 --> 01:17:57,971
- [Jordan] Yeah.

1693
01:17:57,972 --> 01:18:00,955
(gentle sultry music)

1694
01:18:00,956 --> 01:18:02,105
- Ethel?

1695
01:18:02,106 --> 01:18:03,107
- Jughead!

1696
01:18:06,167 --> 01:18:07,168
Hi.

1697
01:18:09,137 --> 01:18:11,723
(upbeat music)

1698
01:18:13,731 --> 01:18:15,776
And you must be Jughead Jr.

1699
01:18:16,854 --> 01:18:19,375
- That's me, Jughead Jr.

1700
01:18:19,376 --> 01:18:21,391
- You're handsome just like your father.

1701
01:18:22,625 --> 01:18:23,760
Well, come on.

1702
01:18:23,761 --> 01:18:25,462
I was just getting in the jacuzzi.

1703
01:18:26,609 --> 01:18:27,610
Come on.

1704
01:18:29,400 --> 01:18:33,730
- Jacuzzi, jacuzzi. (grunting)

1705
01:18:33,731 --> 01:18:35,471
- Beautiful, right?

1706
01:18:35,472 --> 01:18:38,564
But don't tell anyone about
this place, it's the gang's.

1707
01:18:38,565 --> 01:18:39,917
- Archie, who would I tell?

1708
01:18:42,229 --> 01:18:43,231
- Oh, I'm saving

1709
01:18:43,232 --> 01:18:44,330
(glass shattering)

1710
01:18:44,331 --> 01:18:45,805
that.

1711
01:18:45,806 --> 01:18:47,964
- That the bottle, are you kidding?

1712
01:18:47,965 --> 01:18:49,817
- Well, they don't make them anymore.

1713
01:18:52,770 --> 01:18:55,711
- Honey, if you wanna get attached

1714
01:18:55,712 --> 01:18:57,573
to an old root beer bottle, that's fine.

1715
01:18:57,574 --> 01:18:59,405
And it's even okay if you wanna think

1716
01:18:59,406 --> 01:19:01,267
an ice cream store is the Living In.

1717
01:19:01,268 --> 01:19:04,090
But try and keep some perspective.

1718
01:19:04,091 --> 01:19:06,763
- Pam, it's not just an ice cream store.

1719
01:19:06,764 --> 01:19:08,745
It's our ice cream store.

1720
01:19:08,746 --> 01:19:11,988
Mine, and Jughead's, and
Betty, and Veronica's,

1721
01:19:11,989 --> 01:19:14,244
and Moose's, and yes, even Reggie's.

1722
01:19:17,875 --> 01:19:18,836
- Betty and Veronica will be

1723
01:19:18,837 --> 01:19:20,487
at the party tonight, won't they?

1724
01:19:25,412 --> 01:19:26,513
I'd like to meet them.

1725
01:19:27,364 --> 01:19:29,976
- And I'm sure that
they'd like to meet you,

1726
01:19:29,977 --> 01:19:31,447
but if you don't want to go, that's okay.

1727
01:19:31,448 --> 01:19:32,282
I mean, you said,

1728
01:19:32,283 --> 01:19:35,171
"You were worried about
nodding and smiling."

1729
01:19:35,172 --> 01:19:36,406
- I've been practicing.

1730
01:19:37,293 --> 01:19:38,294

1741

- Hi, Archie.

1742
01:20:17,353 --> 01:20:18,354
- Ethel.

1743
01:20:19,706 --> 01:20:21,181
- Come on boys, let's dance.

1744
01:20:24,631 --> 01:20:26,222
- Ethel's an international model now.

1745
01:20:26,223 --> 01:20:27,124
I guess when we knew her,

1746
01:20:27,125 --> 01:20:29,165
she was going through an awkward phase.

1747
01:20:29,166 --> 01:20:30,670
- Yeah, I guess.

1748
01:20:36,103 --> 01:20:39,902
- Archie, we're both in love with you.

1749
01:20:39,903 --> 01:20:42,022
- But you have to make a choice.

1750
01:20:44,795 --> 01:20:47,663
(Archie chuckling)

1751
01:20:47,664 --> 01:20:49,195
- Pam.

1752
01:20:49,196 --> 01:20:53,309
This, this, this, this,
this is Betty and Veronica.

1753
01:20:53,310 --> 01:20:54,311
- I see.

1754
01:20:56,313 --> 01:20:57,304
- We're waiting.

1755
01:20:57,305 --> 01:20:59,675
- Excuse me, I was here first.

1756
01:20:59,676 --> 01:21:01,507
What is going on?

1757
01:21:01,508 --> 01:21:04,180
- Time for the band to go on.

1758
01:21:04,181 --> 01:21:06,676
You can't disappoint an old man, Andrews.

1759
01:21:08,685 --> 01:21:11,237
Especially the one who
just saved your neck.

1760
01:21:11,238 --> 01:21:13,129
- No, I guess I can't.

1761
01:21:13,130 --> 01:21:14,931

- You're giving me a chance?

1766
01:21:24,601 --> 01:21:25,621
- [Mr. Weatherbee] Hold the record please.

1767
01:21:25,622 --> 01:21:28,594
Would the rest of the band
please assemble on stage.

1768
01:21:28,595 --> 01:21:30,096
- What's going on with her?

1769
01:21:30,097 --> 01:21:31,867
- The reunion's warping them.

1770
01:21:31,868 --> 01:21:34,540
- Small town sentimentality.

1771
01:21:34,541 --> 01:21:35,741
I'm sick of it.

1772
01:21:35,742 --> 01:21:37,034
- I know what you mean.

1773
01:21:43,896 --> 01:21:44,897
- Robert.

1774
01:21:46,011 --> 01:21:47,012
- Pam.

1778
01:22:10,127 --> 01:22:12,780
we're out of practice, and we're over 30.

So be kind.

1782
01:22:18,274 --> 01:22:19,275
- Wait!

1783
01:22:20,037 --> 01:22:21,691
Nobody's playing without me.

1817

Pop Tate won't move.

1818
01:23:54,691 --> 01:23:57,205
The bulldozers are gonna drive right over.

1819
01:23:57,206 --> 01:24:00,192

01:24:00,193 --> 01:24:02,778

(group chattering)

1823
01:24:34,541 --> 01:24:35,542
- Hey, there he is.

1824
01:24:36,526 --> 01:24:37,360
- You gotta help Pops.

1825
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:38,355
- Yeah, yeah.

1826
01:24:38,355 --> 01:24:39,346
- They're gonna doze right over him.

1827
01:24:39,347 --> 01:24:40,636
It's gonna be a bloody mess.

1828
01:24:40,637 --> 01:24:41,687
- And we'll lose our jobs.

1829
01:24:41,688 --> 01:24:42,529
- Don't worry I'll take care of him.

1830
01:24:42,529 --> 01:24:43,530
- Go get him.

1831
01:24:45,412 --> 01:24:46,582
- What are you doing?

1832
01:24:46,583 --> 01:24:47,417
- My laundry.

1833
01:24:47,418 --> 01:24:49,555
What does it look like I'm doing, Archie?

1834
01:24:49,556 --> 01:24:54,561
- Reggie, you are a poor sportsman.

1835
01:25:02,139 --> 01:25:04,720
- A gift, sir, from Ms. Lodge.

1836
01:25:04,721 --> 01:25:06,136
- Yeah, right, thanks.

1837
01:25:08,004 --> 01:25:11,056
Pops, this is not gonna
accomplish anything.

1838
01:25:11,057 --> 01:25:12,256
Oh, Pops, now look.

1839
01:25:13,468 --> 01:25:16,471
(car doors banging)

1840
01:25:17,717 --> 01:25:18,928
No, no, no.

1841
01:25:21,328 --> 01:25:25,498
You'll have to arrest me too.

1842
01:25:25,499 --> 01:25:27,247
- And me too.
- Yeah, Jughead.

1843
01:25:29,166 --> 01:25:30,580
Yeah, folks come on.

1844
01:25:32,679 --> 01:25:34,089
- Come on, Betty, you're coming with me.

1845
01:25:34,090 --> 01:25:35,114
- Don't touch me.

1846
01:25:36,241 --> 01:25:37,074
- Don't touch you, I'm your boy-

1847
01:25:37,075 --> 01:25:39,525
- You're a bully, and I'm
sick of being pushed around.

1848
01:25:39,526 --> 01:25:41,837
Go and pick on somebody your own size.

1849
01:25:41,838 --> 01:25:42,922
We're through.

1850
01:25:47,874 --> 01:25:51,116
- In case you haven't noticed,
demonstrations are out.

1851
01:25:51,117 --> 01:25:53,042
I demand you stop this right now.

1852
01:25:54,571 --> 01:25:55,572
- I can't do that.

1853
01:25:57,244 --> 01:25:58,894
- Archie, you're pushing me.

1854
01:25:58,895 --> 01:26:00,797
I've put up with a lot from you today.

1855
01:26:03,640 --> 01:26:07,143
(police radio chattering)

1856
01:26:09,765 --> 01:26:12,238
- [Man] What are you
gonna break our heads now?

1857
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:13,821
- [Man 2] We're not leaving!

1858
01:26:13,822 --> 01:26:14,659
- [Woman] Come on, the can't arrest all-

1859
01:26:14,660 --> 01:26:16,655
- This is my business, Veronica.

1860
01:26:16,656 --> 01:26:17,490
- [Woman 2] What do you
think you're gonna do?

1861
01:26:17,491 --> 01:26:21,324
- Remember, you need me
as much as I need you.

1862
01:26:21,325 --> 01:26:23,729
- I don't need this.

1863
01:26:23,730 --> 01:26:25,110
Disown me.

1864
01:26:25,111 --> 01:26:27,122
I'll wait tables before
I take another cent

1865
01:26:27,123 --> 01:26:28,425
from a heartless monster.

1866
01:26:28,426 --> 01:26:31,056
- Yeah!
- I've given you everything.

1867
01:26:31,057 --> 01:26:33,219
- Everything money could buy.

1868
01:26:33,220 --> 01:26:37,553
All you did was throw
gifts, and I took them,

1869
01:26:37,554 --> 01:26:39,168
and I hated myself for it.

1870
01:26:40,843 --> 01:26:41,748
- [Man 3] You got a cell big enough

1871
01:26:41,749 --> 01:26:43,368
to hold the whole town?

1872
01:26:43,369 --> 01:26:46,455
- I had no idea you felt so strongly.

1873
01:26:48,325 --> 01:26:53,192
- Make your choice,
Father, me or your money.

1874
01:27:04,120 --> 01:27:05,522
- [Hyrum] Call off the crew.

1875
01:27:07,233 --> 01:27:12,238
(group cheering)
(group clapping)

1876
01:27:22,478 --> 01:27:24,360
(insects chirping)

1877
01:27:24,361 --> 01:27:25,362
- Done, sir.

1878
01:27:26,132 --> 01:27:27,303
- Done?

1879
01:27:27,304 --> 01:27:29,885
- Your problem's almost eliminated.

1880
01:27:29,886 --> 01:27:33,879
- You were supposed to frighten
Archie, not eliminating him.

1881
01:27:33,880 --> 01:27:35,741
- Well, it's only a bomb.

1882
01:27:35,742 --> 01:27:37,693
- There are hundreds of people out there!

1883
01:27:37,694 --> 01:27:38,864
- No problem, sir.

1884
01:27:38,865 --> 01:27:40,460
It has to be triggered by this.

1885
01:27:45,862 --> 01:27:46,876
- Give that to me.

1886
01:27:47,766 --> 01:27:50,101
- I don't know if I want to.

1887
01:27:53,748 --> 01:27:55,836
(group cheering)

1888
01:27:55,837 --> 01:27:57,422
- Ah, ha, ha, yeah!

1889
01:27:58,480 --> 01:28:00,148
Pop's here for good.

1890
01:28:02,400 --> 01:28:03,473
- The package!

1891
01:28:03,474 --> 01:28:04,743
- Yeah, yeah, thanks Veronica.

1892
01:28:04,744 --> 01:28:05,767
It's very nice.

1893
01:28:05,768 --> 01:28:06,728
- It's a bomb.

1894
01:28:06,729 --> 01:28:08,261
- It's a bomb?

1895
01:28:08,262 --> 01:28:09,777
A bomb, a bomb!

1896
01:28:09,778 --> 01:28:11,152
- A bomb!

1897
01:28:11,153 --> 01:28:12,154
- A bomb!

1898
01:28:13,136 --> 01:28:14,313
It's a bomb!

1899
01:28:14,314 --> 01:28:17,149
(group screaming)

1900
01:28:20,113 --> 01:28:21,114
- A bomb?

1901
01:28:24,077 --> 01:28:29,082
- This way!
- That way!

1902
01:28:30,455 --> 01:28:33,577
- [Archie] A bomb, a bomb, a bomb!

1903
01:28:33,578 --> 01:28:34,758
- [Cop] A what?

1904
01:28:34,759 --> 01:28:36,722
A bomb?
- A bomb!

1905
01:28:36,723 --> 01:28:38,258
- [Cop] That's a bomb.

1906
01:28:38,259 --> 01:28:39,810
(Archie yelling)

1907
01:28:39,811 --> 01:28:40,651
- That's a bomb!

1908
01:28:40,652 --> 01:28:41,985
- That's a bomb!

1909
01:28:43,227 --> 01:28:46,281
(Archie panting)

1910
01:28:46,282 --> 01:28:47,806
- Isn't winning enough?

1911
01:28:47,807 --> 01:28:49,675
- Can't you just shut up for once?

1912
01:28:49,676 --> 01:28:52,828
- You have to humiliate me more.

1913
01:28:52,829 --> 01:28:54,750
You made this whole thing up.

1914
01:28:54,751 --> 01:28:55,585
There isn't any

1915
01:28:55,586 --> 01:28:58,338
(bomb exploding)

1916
01:29:05,417 --> 01:29:06,250
bomb.

1917
01:29:06,251 --> 01:29:10,563
(metal thudding)
(siren wailing)

1918
01:29:10,564 --> 01:29:13,316
(birds chirping)

1919
01:29:27,484 --> 01:29:28,960
- Pam, listen.

1920
01:29:28,961 --> 01:29:30,516
- You don't have to say it.

1921
01:29:30,517 --> 01:29:33,579
After all this, I don't
wanna be with you anymore

1922
01:29:33,580 --> 01:29:34,803
than it seems you wanna be with me.

1923
01:29:34,804 --> 01:29:36,852
- Listen, I'm really sorry about all this.

1924
01:29:36,853 --> 01:29:37,694
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1925
01:29:37,695 --> 01:29:40,095
I certainly didn't plan any of this.

1926
01:29:40,096 --> 01:29:42,317
I mean, if I had the last three
days to do all over again,

1927
01:29:42,318 --> 01:29:44,784
I, I'd do exactly the same thing.

1928
01:29:45,802 --> 01:29:48,203
It's not nostalgia or, or,
or any of those things.

1929
01:29:48,204 --> 01:29:49,412
It's, it's real.

1930
01:29:49,413 --> 01:29:50,936
(trunk thuds)

1931
01:29:50,937 --> 01:29:53,789
I know it sounds really
weird, but after all this,

1932
01:29:53,790 --> 01:29:56,161
after everything that's happened,

1933
01:29:56,162 --> 01:29:58,053
I feel a lot clearer about things.

1934
01:29:58,054 --> 01:29:59,679
- It's okay, Archie.

1935
01:30:04,240 --> 01:30:05,241
- Really?

1936
01:30:06,072 --> 01:30:07,073
- Ready to go?

1937
01:30:10,457 --> 01:30:12,258
- Robert and I have a lot in common.

1938
01:30:14,926 --> 01:30:17,762
(Archie chuckles)

1939
01:30:20,482 --> 01:30:23,067
(gentle music)

1940
01:30:31,025 --> 01:30:31,988
- You sure you got everything?

1941
01:30:31,989 --> 01:30:33,597
I feel like we-
- I hope I.

1942
01:30:33,598 --> 01:30:34,930
- Hey.
- Hey.

1943
01:30:34,931 --> 01:30:37,062
- I was.
- Talk to Pam?

1944
01:30:37,063 --> 01:30:39,198
- Yeah, get that piano off your back yet?

1945
01:30:40,216 --> 01:30:41,300
- I'm all alone now.

1946
01:30:43,820 --> 01:30:44,900
- We've gotta go.

1947
01:30:44,901 --> 01:30:45,902
- Oh sure.

1948
01:30:50,017 --> 01:30:51,705
It was great seeing you guys.

1949
01:30:52,769 --> 01:30:54,810
- Hey, you're not alone, you've got us.

1950
01:30:54,811 --> 01:30:55,652
We'll visit.

1951
01:30:55,653 --> 01:30:56,972
- Yeah, this place is cool.

1952
01:30:56,973 --> 01:30:58,224
- He liked the explosion.

1953
01:31:11,523 --> 01:31:14,530
(door clicks)

1954
01:31:14,531 --> 01:31:15,364
(door bangs)

1955
01:31:15,364 --> 01:31:16,312
- Good job, there geek.

1956
01:31:16,313 --> 01:31:18,543
Uh, Archie.

1957
01:31:18,544 --> 01:31:20,065
Would you shake our hands?

1958
01:31:20,066 --> 01:31:21,552
- We even washed them.

1959
01:31:21,553 --> 01:31:23,308
(Archie chuckles)

1960
01:31:23,309 --> 01:31:24,449
- Thanks.
- Thanks, Arch.

1961
01:31:24,450 --> 01:31:25,284
- You bet.

1962
01:31:25,284 --> 01:31:26,222
- See you tomorrow, Pops.

1963
01:31:26,223 --> 01:31:28,825
- Hey Pops, don't forget
the back door's still open.

1964
01:31:31,332 --> 01:31:32,166
(door clicks)
(bell rings)

1965
01:31:32,167 --> 01:31:35,831
- [Pop] Archie, uh, how about
a molt for old time's sake?

1966
01:31:35,832 --> 01:31:38,017
- [Archie] Set 'em up,
Pops and keep 'em coming.

1967
01:31:39,375 --> 01:31:40,820
- We're still waiting.

1968
01:31:43,159 --> 01:31:45,230
- Choose, Archie.

1969
01:31:45,231 --> 01:31:48,323
- We're making it as
easy as possible for you.

1970
01:31:48,324 --> 01:31:49,915
No matter what you decide.

1971
01:31:49,916 --> 01:31:52,622
We won't be mad at you or each other,

1972
01:31:54,180 --> 01:31:55,775
but we need to know.

1973
01:31:59,027 --> 01:32:02,089
- Well.

1974
01:32:02,090 --> 01:32:05,072
(water splashing)
(Archie groans)

1975
01:32:05,073 --> 01:32:06,157
- Ah, Jordan.

1976
01:32:07,058 --> 01:32:08,554
- Sorry, Archie.

1977
01:32:08,555 --> 01:32:09,388
- No problem.

1978
01:32:09,388 --> 01:32:10,229
Get over here.

1979
01:32:10,230 --> 01:32:11,931
Come here, get over here.

1980
01:32:17,033 --> 01:32:18,503
- You know, I was thinking on the bus,

1981
01:32:18,504 --> 01:32:20,275
you know how many shrinks
there are in the city?

1982
01:32:20,276 --> 01:32:21,110
Thousands.

1983
01:32:21,111 --> 01:32:23,128
There's barely enough
lunatic to go around,

1984
01:32:23,129 --> 01:32:24,840
and Jordan couldn't bear to live far away

1985
01:32:24,841 --> 01:32:25,942
from his Uncle Archie.

1986
01:32:27,513 --> 01:32:28,808
I had a little to say in.

1987
01:32:32,138 --> 01:32:36,736
- So hmm, what are you two gonna do?

1988
01:32:37,754 --> 01:32:40,606
- I'm staying here this summer to write.

1989
01:32:40,607 --> 01:32:42,558
My publisher says, "I have a real future

1990
01:32:42,559 --> 01:32:44,628
as a romance novelist."

1991
01:32:46,102 --> 01:32:48,413
And in the fall we'll see if Riverdale

1992
01:32:48,414 --> 01:32:50,996
needs another grade school teacher.

1993
01:32:50,997 --> 01:32:53,518
- Paris is jammed with
tourists this time of year

1994
01:32:53,519 --> 01:32:55,985
and Daddy and I have a
few things to work on.

1995
01:32:56,883 --> 01:32:58,473
When are you leaving?

1996
01:32:58,474 --> 01:33:01,631
- Uh, oh, I'm not.

1997
01:33:03,039 --> 01:33:04,149
- But Pam?

1998
01:33:04,150 --> 01:33:06,642
- Is back in the city.

1999
01:33:06,643 --> 01:33:08,537
We broke up.

2000
01:33:10,078 --> 01:33:11,412
- Yes, yes, yes.

2001
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:15,655
- Well, have a seat.

2002
01:33:22,889 --> 01:33:26,221
- Okay, everybody smile.

2003
01:33:26,222 --> 01:33:27,362
- [Archie] Get in here.

2004
01:33:27,363 --> 01:33:28,364
Look pretty.

2005
01:33:29,568 --> 01:33:32,822
(Reggie clears throat)

2006
01:33:34,702 --> 01:33:36,551
(door bangs)

2007
01:33:36,552 --> 01:33:37,553
- Sorry.

2008
01:33:38,414 --> 01:33:39,945
- Little louder, Reg.

2009
01:33:39,946 --> 01:33:41,687
- I think everyone heard.

2010
01:33:41,688 --> 01:33:42,689
Come on, Reggie.

2011
01:33:45,802 --> 01:33:48,527
Okay, nobody move.

2012
01:33:48,528 --> 01:33:50,950
- I don't think anybody will.

2013
01:33:50,951 --> 01:33:53,620
(camera clicks)

2014
01:33:56,385 --> 01:33:59,055
(camera clicks)

2015
01:34:01,489 --> 01:34:04,075
(upbeat music)

2016
01:34:41,218 --> 01:34:42,770
(gentle upbeat music)

2017
01:34:42,771 --> 01:34:43,691
(graphic whooshing)

2018
01:34:43,692 --> 01:34:45,311
(graphic chimes)

2019
01:34:45,312 --> 01:34:46,953
(upbeat music)

2020
01:34:46,954 --> 01:34:47,955
- [Boy] DIC.
