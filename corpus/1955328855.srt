1
00:02:31,520 --> 00:02:33,318
I'm better now.

2
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:35,638
I think it helped.

3
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:36,990
That's good.

4
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,556
Things been busy?

5
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:44,511
Things are always busy, James.

6
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:50,320
I was thinking,

7
00:02:52,120 --> 00:02:55,192
I could just [???] you how land
and drive myself to Boston.

8
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:57,869
That way you wouldn't
have to leave the farm.

9
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:04,556
What do you think?

10
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:11,033
We need to talk about
you going to college.

11
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:18,717
FAIR HAVEN ORCHAND

12
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,116
James.

13
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,033
That was my money, you
had no right to use it!

14
00:03:55,240 --> 00:03:58,039
Sometimes life is unfair,
we both know that.

15
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,352
There were hospital bills, and the funeral had to
be paid for. Not to mention your treatment

16
00:04:05,960 --> 00:04:10,398
Look, I've been putting some money
away while you were gone so,

17
00:04:10,600 --> 00:04:15,880
If you could just help with the harvest next Fall
then maybe you could go to college in a year.

18
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:21,792
I already deferred my enrollment once
and give my spot to somebody else.

19
00:04:24,480 --> 00:04:27,234
I'm doing my best, James. Jesus.

20
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:53,398
When was the last time you
 fantasized sexually about a man?

21
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,920
About four months ago, I guess.

22
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:00,154
- Nothing since then?
- No.
- Dreams?

23
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:02,355
- Gay dreams?
- No.

24
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:09,795
- What about women?
- I think about women often.

25
00:05:11,640 --> 00:05:15,998
- And what do you think about when you masturbate?
- I don't masturbate.

26
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,316
- You looking forward to go home?
- No, I've had a very nice time here.

27
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:26,915
I'm not trying to trick you.

28
00:05:30,188 --> 00:05:32,681
I'm sure it would be very nice.

29
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,510
- Have you spoken with your father?
- He called on my birthday.

30
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:42,870
How's he doing?

31
00:05:44,086 --> 00:05:45,475
Seems fine.

32
00:05:49,040 --> 00:05:53,717
James did your father ever seek counciling
after your mother passed away?

33
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:59,080
- He may not dealt with his grief.
- My father' is a very strong man, I don't think he'll need therapy for anything.

34
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:04,159
Sometimes even strong people
need someone to talk to.

35
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:09,680
I'm sure he'll be glad to have you
around before you head off to ...

36
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,160
Berklee College of Music. You
must be looking forward to that.

37
00:06:16,360 --> 00:06:17,430
Yes, very much.

38
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,792
When you came here you said your greatest
desire was to become a concert pianist.

39
00:06:23,040 --> 00:06:24,520
Is that still the case?

40
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,631
I'd still like to but... it's not the most
important thing in life anymore.

41
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:30,990
What is now?

42
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:32,516
God,

43
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:40,354
I'd like to settle down,
meet a girl have a family.

44
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,520
I am sure you can still fit
music in there somewhere.

45
00:06:46,320 --> 00:06:47,913
Being away from home

46
00:06:48,120 --> 00:06:52,114
you're going to find yourself
in a lot of new situations

47
00:06:52,320 --> 00:06:55,631
It'll be a lot of temptations
out there for you.

48
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:57,196
I know.

49
00:06:58,440 --> 00:06:59,920
I'll be good.

50
00:07:03,640 --> 00:07:05,199
I'm sure you will.

51
00:07:07,640 --> 00:07:10,280
Well, I think that's badassery.

52
00:07:11,400 --> 00:07:13,312
Once more  before taking the road?

53
00:07:18,920 --> 00:07:21,310
Our Father who hart in heaven .

54
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:25,953
We ask you to bless James as
he goes forth from here today.

55
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,040
To watch over him as he
walks through temptation.

56
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,793
Guide him, help him,
deliver him from evil.

57
00:07:34,480 --> 00:07:37,393
Lead him on your path to salvation.

58
00:07:38,120 --> 00:07:41,272
Help him to avoid the
sins of the flesh

59
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,036
And to embrace the
glory of your light.

60
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:47,960
We ask these things in
your name, oh Lord

61
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:49,276
And pray.

62
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,590
- Amen.
- Amen.

63
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:42,516
Goddamit!

64
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:47,359
- You okay?
- Yeah, just stupid.

65
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,157
Watch out the handle
is really hot.

66
00:12:05,520 --> 00:12:07,079
I've been thinking.

67
00:12:08,120 --> 00:12:13,479
Maybe taking a course at the Community College
would be a better idea. Give you a leg up.

68
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:18,675
I don't know the courses they have I don't
know if Berklee would accept them.

69
00:12:21,400 --> 00:12:25,110
If I were you I wouldn't go to
Boston I'd stay closer to home.

70
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:29,275
Vermont Tech is a good school.

71
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,573
Dad, I'm studying music.

72
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,396
- What to be a teacher?
- Maybe. Or play.

73
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:42,070
Okay.

74
00:12:42,366 --> 00:12:44,170
That's what I wanna do.

75
00:12:45,480 --> 00:12:47,060
But less.

76
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,353
Look, if I'm paying for this I want you to major in
either agricultural business or something like that.

77
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,673
- Maybe I will pay for it.
- And how you gonna do that?

78
00:12:57,680 --> 00:12:59,255
I'll find a job.

79
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:00,630
Doing what?

80
00:13:00,640 --> 00:13:02,294
Whatever I have to.

81
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:08,198
A minimum wage is not gonna
pay the bills and school both.

82
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,956
<i>Dammit!</i> I'll figure it out.

83
00:13:12,960 --> 00:13:17,239
Why do you have to make things so
difficult? I want what's best for you.

84
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:21,030
You know, one day you gonna inherit this place.
You gonna have this place all to yourself.

85
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,874
Not any time soon.

86
00:13:22,920 --> 00:13:24,400
We can hope not.

87
00:13:24,680 --> 00:13:28,310
But when you do, I want
you to be able to run it.

88
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:34,151
That's mine so
I'll have to sell it.

89
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,150
No, you will not sell this farm.

90
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:42,036
This farm was your grandfather's,
this farm is my grandfather's!

91
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:47,998
This place is home, this place is a roof over your
head it's money in the bank when you needed.

92
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,350
You don't understand that
now, you have no idea.

93
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:55,632
But one day you'll appreciate it.

94
00:13:58,400 --> 00:14:02,599
Why can't you see I'm just trying
to do what's best for you?

95
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:30,915
I'll take a look at those classes.
The Community College.

96
00:14:36,360 --> 00:14:38,253
- I appreciate it.
- Yeah.

97
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:13,153
You can just drive around back to load
in the dock. Someone can give you a hand.

98
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:15,452
Make sure you get a receipt.

99
00:15:15,560 --> 00:15:17,089
Can you handle that?

100
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:19,630
Yeah.

101
00:16:09,280 --> 00:16:10,855
James?!

102
00:16:14,920 --> 00:16:16,839
When did you get back?

103
00:16:18,200 --> 00:16:19,900
A few days ago.

104
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:23,459
- How are you?
- I'm fine.

105
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:37,231
- What are you doing here?
- I work here.

106
00:16:37,400 --> 00:16:39,676
We can't be friends
anymore, okay?

107
00:16:40,760 --> 00:16:42,340
Friends?

108
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:46,080
I can't be around you.

109
00:16:49,240 --> 00:16:50,556
I see.

110
00:16:52,360 --> 00:16:54,213
Things are different now.

111
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:56,319
I'm different.

112
00:17:00,760 --> 00:17:02,210
So you..?

113
00:17:07,320 --> 00:17:08,790
I got to go.

114
00:18:27,400 --> 00:18:29,478
How are you feeling right now?

115
00:18:30,680 --> 00:18:31,996
Sad.

116
00:18:32,920 --> 00:18:35,116
Can you expand on that?

117
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:38,374
Sad? How? Describe it.

118
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,110
Alone. I feel alone.

119
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,210
Lonely.

120
00:18:46,360 --> 00:18:48,438
Do you miss your mother?

121
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:54,176
Yes.

122
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:56,480
Your father?

123
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:01,314
What about your friends?
Were you close to them?

124
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:06,592
Did you have any
special friends?

125
00:19:13,080 --> 00:19:15,137
You mean like best friends?

126
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:17,690
More special than that.

127
00:19:18,040 --> 00:19:19,899
Do you have a girlfriend?

128
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,630
No.

129
00:19:25,960 --> 00:19:27,680
What about a boyfriend?

130
00:19:33,640 --> 00:19:35,777
It's okay. You can tell me.

131
00:19:37,720 --> 00:19:39,070
Yes.

132
00:19:39,800 --> 00:19:41,250
How many?

133
00:19:43,520 --> 00:19:44,736
One.

134
00:19:46,360 --> 00:19:47,930
What is his name?

135
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,236
Charlie.

136
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,637
Were you intimate?

137
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:04,075
It's okay, you can tell me.

138
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,856
Sometimes.

139
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,736
How that make you feel?

140
00:20:14,920 --> 00:20:16,952
I don't know. Good I guess.

141
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:27,078
Sins makes us feel good while we're commiting
it, James but that doesn't mean it's good for us.

142
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:30,757
It can really mess us up inside.

143
00:20:32,160 --> 00:20:35,756
And when we're done,
we feel bad about it.

144
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:37,629
Does that make sense?

145
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:41,216
Yes.

146
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:44,197
Charlie is like a drug.

147
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:51,473
It's hard being away from him right now I
know but being with him would be worse.

148
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,850
Once he's out of your system I promise
you, you're going to feel so much better.

149
00:21:00,440 --> 00:21:04,853
And then you gonna wonder why
you ever had him in your life.

150
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:31,860
Did you get that receipt?

151
00:21:35,680 --> 00:21:36,996
Well?

152
00:21:38,320 --> 00:21:41,160
Dad can you take care
of this from now on?

153
00:21:41,160 --> 00:21:42,476
Why?

154
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,560
I give you one simple job you can't even do that?
- Forget it.

155
00:22:19,400 --> 00:22:21,392
I need the receipts.

156
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:25,791
- What?
- I need the receipts for the apples!

157
00:22:33,960 --> 00:22:35,276
Dammit.

158
00:22:43,720 --> 00:22:46,030
Hurry up please.

159
00:22:49,080 --> 00:22:51,236
What did they do to you?

160
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:54,070
Don't worry about it.

161
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:00,017
Are you happier?

162
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:07,955
You seem happier.

163
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:16,399
Maybe I should be send -

164
00:23:36,960 --> 00:23:38,992
I wanna go to church.

165
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:41,593
- What now?
- On Sunday.

166
00:23:41,800 --> 00:23:44,474
- Alright?
- Yeah I guess.

167
00:23:49,240 --> 00:23:53,519
When you were slaves of sin, you were
free in regard to righteousness

168
00:23:54,520 --> 00:23:58,719
So what fruit did you then get from the
things which you are now ashamed?

169
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:01,558
The end of those
things is death.

170
00:24:02,200 --> 00:24:06,114
But now that you've been freed
from sin and enslaved to God,

171
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,855
The fruit that you
get is eternal life.

172
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:16,434
For the wages of sin is death and
the gift of God, is eternal life.

173
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,094
In Jesus Christ

174
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:19,670
Our Lord.

175
00:24:23,680 --> 00:24:26,014
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

176
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:32,836
Richard.

177
00:24:32,860 --> 00:24:34,860
James. So great to have
you back with us.

178
00:24:35,400 --> 00:24:36,670
How have you holding up?

179
00:24:36,680 --> 00:24:39,136
- He's doing alright.
- That's good to hear.

180
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:41,638
- How old are you now?
- I'm 19.

181
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,993
- My Suzi just turned 19. She's going to UVM in the Fall.
- That's a good school.

182
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:50,717
James is saying good bye for Vermont Tech.
Maybe Suzi could give him some advise.

183
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:52,355
I'm sure she would love that.

184
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,697
Hang on, Suzi, could you
come here honey?

185
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,780
- Suzi, you remember James?
- Yeah, not well, we were a year apart in school.

186
00:25:01,240 --> 00:25:04,777
He's going to college in the Fall. Maybe
you could help him with his application.

187
00:25:04,920 --> 00:25:07,594
Yeah I would love to. Let
me give you my number.

188
00:25:09,560 --> 00:25:10,676
Yeah.

189
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:12,350
Yeah, sure.

190
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:25,552
ONLINE REGISTRATION SELECTED COURSES
AGRICULTURE 9:00-10:00 MUSIC THEORY 9:00 - 10:30
musical theory: 9:00 to 10:30

191
00:25:35,280 --> 00:25:36,980
It looks good.

192
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,510
- How many can I take?
- One should be enough now.

193
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:44,556
Okay.

194
00:25:45,160 --> 00:25:47,277
Have you called Suzi yet?

195
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:50,110
- No.
- She seems like a nice girl.

196
00:25:51,800 --> 00:25:53,871
Pretty too.

197
00:25:54,520 --> 00:25:56,637
Yeah.

198
00:26:39,560 --> 00:26:41,558
James, come on in!

199
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:44,259
- How are you?
- Okay.

200
00:26:44,280 --> 00:26:45,550
Great.

201
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:46,716
Suzi!

202
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:49,413
She'll be right down.

203
00:26:55,280 --> 00:26:56,730
- Hi.
- Hi.

204
00:26:57,720 --> 00:27:00,315
So do you want to
come to my room?

205
00:27:12,720 --> 00:27:16,430
Here's my application.
Take a look at it.

206
00:27:23,040 --> 00:27:24,515
Thank you.

207
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,489
I get the feeling you're not really
looking for help with this.

208
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:40,558
I'm sorry, I don't
mean to be rude.

209
00:27:42,600 --> 00:27:44,692
Why the lack of interest?

210
00:27:49,160 --> 00:27:53,996
My dad wants me to apply
to a state school, but I was...

211
00:27:54,800 --> 00:27:57,190
I'd like to go somewhere else.

212
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,170
Where do you wanna go?

213
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:04,051
I was accepted at Berklee
College of Music in Boston.

214
00:28:04,560 --> 00:28:06,110
Wow congratulations!

215
00:28:07,280 --> 00:28:08,650
Thank you.

216
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:14,319
Dad says it's not
practical though.

217
00:28:15,720 --> 00:28:17,170
I see.

218
00:28:17,240 --> 00:28:20,838
He's probably just trying to do
what he thinks is best for you.

219
00:28:24,680 --> 00:28:26,455
You are engaged.

220
00:28:27,320 --> 00:28:31,280
No, it's a promise ring.

221
00:28:34,440 --> 00:28:35,856
What is that?

222
00:28:36,400 --> 00:28:40,419
It means I've promised to stay
a virgin until I'm married.

223
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,111
- It's silly, it's okay.
- No, I don't think so.

224
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:53,880
Well, you know... I should...

225
00:28:55,160 --> 00:28:58,153
I have some stuff
to do I'm sorry.

226
00:28:58,360 --> 00:29:02,195
- I'm sorry I wasn't of much help.
- Don't worry about it I'll figure out.

227
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:04,751
And if you have any more
questions you have my number.

228
00:29:05,080 --> 00:29:09,199
Or, we could just hang out, you
know it could be funny too.

229
00:29:10,680 --> 00:29:12,339
- Hang out?
- Yeah.

230
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:15,757
We could grab some dinner, watch
a movie have something fun.

231
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:20,674
Sure.

232
00:29:20,698 --> 00:29:22,479
You don't have to
if you don't want to.

233
00:29:22,680 --> 00:29:23,796
Yeah...

234
00:29:24,560 --> 00:29:27,678
I need to check my schedule.
I'll give you a call.

235
00:29:27,920 --> 00:29:29,390
- Alright.
- Okay.

236
00:29:30,760 --> 00:29:32,110
Bye.

237
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,478
I'll be back with your receipts.

238
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:52,912
I'm sorry about how
I acted the other day.

239
00:30:00,280 --> 00:30:01,855
You should be.

240
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:07,351
I don't agree with this.

241
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:13,195
But If we can't be lovers
we could at least be civil.

242
00:30:14,920 --> 00:30:16,036
Yeah.

243
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:35,854
Did your father ever hit you?

244
00:30:37,720 --> 00:30:38,870
No.

245
00:30:40,040 --> 00:30:42,118
Why are we doing this?

246
00:30:44,850 --> 00:30:50,840
I'm trying to estabilish if there's been
any emotional trauma in your life.

247
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:54,397
Something that happened a long time
ago that you may have forgotten about.

248
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:58,371
I don't think so I think
I would remember it.

249
00:30:58,491 --> 00:31:04,952
No, not necessarily. We often repress
difficult or painful memories.

250
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:07,356
If something like that
did happened if...

251
00:31:07,560 --> 00:31:14,131
You were abused or mistreated, for instance
it would help explain your situation now.

252
00:31:14,760 --> 00:31:18,640
And if that's the case working
on that might help you to

253
00:31:18,840 --> 00:31:23,198
Transition back to healthy
heterosexual desires.

254
00:31:23,760 --> 00:31:26,758
Like I'd be interested in girls?

255
00:31:28,680 --> 00:31:33,709
I believe you already are. Deep down.
That's what nature intended you to be.

256
00:31:33,960 --> 00:31:36,953
Something just knocked you
off course along the way.

257
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:40,353
I mean I wasn't abused or molested
or anything like that.

258
00:31:40,360 --> 00:31:42,074
Okay, that's great.

259
00:31:42,680 --> 00:31:47,277
We'll look for another explanation then. You
and I can work on finding that together.

260
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:51,480
I want to help you, James.
But you have to want it too.

261
00:31:56,600 --> 00:31:58,598
- I do.
- Good.

262
00:31:59,400 --> 00:32:04,953
It won't be easy. You have to work at it, you
have to push yourself toward healthy behavior.

263
00:32:05,160 --> 00:32:07,356
Try to avoid temptation.

264
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:13,551
Everyone is different. You may have tremendous success
walk out of here a total heterosexual young man,

265
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:18,040
Or you may struggle
with your feelings.

266
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:07,313
Hello, hi, it's James. How are you?

267
00:33:08,440 --> 00:33:10,120
Good. I'm good.

268
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:16,517
Listen, I was thinking
about what you said,

269
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:21,636
And I was wondering if maybe you
want to grab dinner tonight?

270
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:23,676
Yeah, sure.

271
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:28,578
Sure, six o'clock.

272
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:32,117
Yeah I agree. See you there.

273
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:34,716
Bye.

274
00:33:45,200 --> 00:33:48,338
I was heading into town. I just wondered
if you needed some supplies?

275
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,850
No, I'm fine.

276
00:33:50,320 --> 00:33:52,318
You gotta buy
books, don't you?

277
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:55,597
Yeah but I don't know
until classes start.

278
00:33:55,800 --> 00:33:59,191
If you need more let me know.
Are you going somewhere?

279
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:02,395
Yeah, I was going to
grab dinner with Suzi.

280
00:34:03,480 --> 00:34:05,030
Where you going?

281
00:34:07,240 --> 00:34:08,535
I don't know.

282
00:34:08,640 --> 00:34:13,696
Go to the Rubi's. I know they don't look
like much, but the food is good, honestly.

283
00:34:14,200 --> 00:34:16,073
Here my treat.

284
00:34:17,280 --> 00:34:19,233
- Have a big time.
- Thanks.

285
00:35:04,040 --> 00:35:07,497
- We can go somewhere else.
- No, this is fine.

286
00:35:07,600 --> 00:35:10,360
- There's lots of personality.
- You sure?

287
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:12,670
- Absolutely.
- You guys want an appetizer?

288
00:35:12,920 --> 00:35:16,591
- What do you have?
- Chips, pretzels, peanuts.

289
00:35:17,400 --> 00:35:21,992
- I think we're okay for now.
- Let me know when you're ready to order.

290
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,191
- I'm sorry.
-Don't be.

291
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,399
My dad is always saying this place is a den
of sins. I've been dying to see why.

292
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:37,651
I'm kidding. It's fine.

293
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:43,676
In fact, I wish you
would have sinner.

294
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:46,173
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

295
00:35:46,240 --> 00:35:49,196
I wish we had known each
other in High school.

296
00:35:51,400 --> 00:35:53,995
We were in different
grounds I guess.

297
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:58,154
You were always with Brad
Miler and Charlie Greene.

298
00:35:59,480 --> 00:36:02,154
Is it true what they
say about Charlie?

299
00:36:04,480 --> 00:36:07,434
- What did they say?
- That he is gay.

300
00:36:10,120 --> 00:36:14,433
I don't think I should reveal
the details of his life.

301
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:16,194
That's crazy!

302
00:36:20,080 --> 00:36:21,607
Does it bother you?

303
00:36:23,240 --> 00:36:27,353
I think that people should
live as they like.

304
00:36:32,720 --> 00:36:36,600
- Thanks again.
- Yeah sure thing.

305
00:36:37,480 --> 00:36:39,109
Guess we see around.

306
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:41,115
Yeah.

307
00:36:48,840 --> 00:36:50,638
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

308
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:53,230
- I'm sorry.
- No, I'm sorry, I...

309
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,632
- I should get off.
- No, no, listen...

310
00:36:59,600 --> 00:37:02,315
I'd like to take things slowly.

311
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,518
- I think slowly is better for me.
- Okay.

312
00:37:08,600 --> 00:37:11,672
Look, I'd like for us to be...

313
00:37:13,600 --> 00:37:15,050
How you want.

314
00:37:15,760 --> 00:37:17,280
Sure. You do.

315
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:18,396
Yeah...

316
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,555
I should go then.

317
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:25,114
- Bye.
- Bye.

318
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:06,694
You still dreaming about
girls? Sexually?

319
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,016
Does anyone know why
we have dreams?

320
00:38:15,036 --> 00:38:21,331
Dreams are our brains way of making sense
of the things we experience during the day.

321
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:26,173
So if for instance, we see
a dog when we are awake,

322
00:38:26,280 --> 00:38:30,274
And we think about that dog.
We may dream about it at night.

323
00:38:30,440 --> 00:38:34,673
When our brain is sorting out those
memories. Does that makes sense?

324
00:38:34,920 --> 00:38:38,955
So if you're having sexual
dreams about women at night,

325
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:43,652
It's probably because you're thinking
about them sexually during the day.

326
00:38:43,760 --> 00:38:46,236
- But I wasn't.
- It's okay.

327
00:38:46,240 --> 00:38:50,792
Everyone slips up from time to time.
You just have to focus and try your best

328
00:38:51,040 --> 00:38:56,069
To stay away from thoughts and situations
that will lead you down the wrong path.

329
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:00,254
Remember your body wants you to
be attracted to the opposite sex.

330
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,315
Why is that?

331
00:39:05,640 --> 00:39:07,893
Because that's what
god intended.

332
00:39:10,600 --> 00:39:13,513
I'm not sure
I believe in God.

333
00:39:14,760 --> 00:39:17,794
That's okay, James.
He believes in you.

334
00:39:20,440 --> 00:39:23,175
God made Adam and Eve.

335
00:39:23,240 --> 00:39:26,797
One man and one woman. Because
that's what's required to have a baby.

336
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:31,313
Not two men, not two women not
three people of different genders.

337
00:39:31,320 --> 00:39:32,636
One and one.

338
00:39:32,640 --> 00:39:35,360
And that's not just to us people
but also in the animal kingdom.

339
00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:38,679
One male lion and one female
lion can make a baby lion.

340
00:39:38,840 --> 00:39:42,038
One male zebra and one female
zebra can make a baby zebra.

341
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,754
Right. I get it.

342
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:48,240
It's in your genes. Your body
wants you to be with a woman

343
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:51,458
So that you can make babies
and carry on the species.

344
00:39:51,520 --> 00:39:54,991
- I don't think I want babies.
- Well...

345
00:39:55,360 --> 00:39:59,274
Maybe not right now, but one
day you will when you're ready.

346
00:39:59,440 --> 00:40:03,559
And you won't be able to have
them with another woman.

347
00:40:16,840 --> 00:40:20,629
I appreciate your interest,
it is a fine offer,

348
00:40:20,840 --> 00:40:25,960
You know it is not for sale. It's been
in the family for generations.

349
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,235
Okay. I'm new here. And interested in
take the orchand in a different direction.

350
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:35,030
A lot of people in the area
think about more organic.

351
00:40:35,240 --> 00:40:38,950
Sure. A lot of the grocery stores
they really get a lot of interest

352
00:40:39,160 --> 00:40:42,239
I think they would pay extra
for organic apples and-

353
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,631
Good luck with that.
The place ain't for sale.

354
00:40:45,840 --> 00:40:48,400
That's a shame you've got
a beautiful property here.

355
00:40:48,600 --> 00:40:50,456
There's nothing we can
do to change your mind?

356
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:52,480
I don't think so.

357
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:55,850
Okay then.

358
00:40:56,440 --> 00:40:58,909
Let me give you my card.

359
00:40:59,120 --> 00:41:03,280
- And if you change your mind.
- You don't need to waste your cards.

360
00:41:03,320 --> 00:41:05,471
Please keep it.

361
00:41:06,520 --> 00:41:09,096
- Alright, good luck.
- Thank you.

362
00:41:27,000 --> 00:41:29,569
- Who were those people?
- A couple of weirdoes.

363
00:41:29,680 --> 00:41:31,175
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

364
00:41:32,440 --> 00:41:34,290
What did they want?

365
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:36,316
They wanted to buy the farm.

366
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,597
Incredible. What
did you tell them?

367
00:41:41,600 --> 00:41:43,554
What do I think I told them?

368
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:49,276
Not thinking about it?

369
00:41:49,440 --> 00:41:52,235
They want to modernize
it. Go organic.

370
00:41:52,960 --> 00:41:56,590
I told them the apples are already organic,
they come right out of the ground.

371
00:41:57,840 --> 00:42:01,112
It think they meant the ones
they use less pesticides dad.

372
00:42:01,120 --> 00:42:04,392
They're not very good
farmers then are they?

373
00:42:04,840 --> 00:42:07,794
A lot of people are starting to think like them.
- It is a phase, it will pass.

374
00:42:07,800 --> 00:42:09,856
I'm just saying we gotta
look into it that's all.

375
00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:11,912
James I appreciate
you want to help

376
00:42:11,936 --> 00:42:14,836
But trust me when I say I know
what the hell I'm doing okay?

377
00:42:15,560 --> 00:42:18,971
When you run the show, you can
grow apples anyway you want.

378
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:23,233
Maybe then you'll find out your old
man knows what he's talking about.

379
00:42:24,560 --> 00:42:26,697
You still in your pajamas?

380
00:43:38,840 --> 00:43:43,192
- I'm sorry, but I'm one handed.
- What happened to you?

381
00:43:43,600 --> 00:43:46,354
- I knocked a door...
- Charlie...

382
00:43:49,000 --> 00:43:51,396
A couple of guys after work.

383
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:56,334
- Here?
- No.

384
00:43:56,640 --> 00:43:58,971
Down in the road.
I go walking home.

385
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:01,914
You can't walk home
on foot from here!

386
00:44:02,120 --> 00:44:04,291
It won't happen again,
okay? I'll be careful.

387
00:44:04,315 --> 00:44:06,199
No, you won't walk
home, I'll drive you.

388
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:08,637
- James I don't need an escort.
- I don't care.

389
00:44:08,661 --> 00:44:09,839
What time is your shift over?

390
00:44:09,840 --> 00:44:12,958
- James...
- What time is your shift over?

391
00:44:15,760 --> 00:44:17,555
- Nine.
- Okay.

392
00:44:17,600 --> 00:44:19,370
See you at nine.

393
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,254
Here it is!

394
00:44:44,960 --> 00:44:46,410
Hi.

395
00:44:50,160 --> 00:44:52,710
- What it's going on?
- I dropped by to surprise you.

396
00:44:52,734 --> 00:44:54,479
I hope that's okay.

397
00:44:54,480 --> 00:44:56,430
Yeah. Sure.

398
00:44:56,600 --> 00:44:59,877
- It was nice sit with you.
- You too.

399
00:45:02,520 --> 00:45:05,800
So my parents wanted me to
invite you to dinner tonight.

400
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:13,612
You know my dad actually is gonna
be cooking dinner tonight.

401
00:45:14,160 --> 00:45:18,677
I just told him I was gonna invite you to dinner
with us and he said he didn't mind eating alone.

402
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:24,035
- If you don't wanna come it's
- No, no, I do.

403
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:26,238
- What time?
- Seven thirty.

404
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:29,677
- Okay.
- I'll see you then. Bye.

405
00:45:45,920 --> 00:45:47,370
Steak...

406
00:45:47,840 --> 00:45:50,111
Getting pretty handy
with the oven.

407
00:45:51,480 --> 00:45:53,672
- You look nice.
- Thanks.

408
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,338
Tell your girlfriend that tomorrow
we'll have her for dinner over here.

409
00:45:57,362 --> 00:45:59,662
We have to keep practicing
not to poison her.

410
00:46:03,720 --> 00:46:06,410
Your mom would be
proud of you.

411
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:13,970
Have a good time.

412
00:46:29,960 --> 00:46:31,690
How are things on
the farm James?

413
00:46:31,714 --> 00:46:33,714
We drive by there almost
every day, don't we ?

414
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:35,798
- All the time.
- It's gorgeous.

415
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:37,693
- It is.
- It's nice.

416
00:46:38,320 --> 00:46:41,438
And so what is it like working
on a apple farm?

417
00:46:43,000 --> 00:46:45,657
It's fine. I guess.

418
00:46:51,120 --> 00:46:53,635
- A lot of work.
- I bet.

419
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:56,254
How long is it been
in your family now?

420
00:46:56,278 --> 00:46:58,678
A long time.

421
00:46:59,360 --> 00:47:01,691
- Well, well...
- It's incredible.

422
00:47:01,800 --> 00:47:05,476
It's only fair having apples from
Fair Haven from now on.

423
00:47:08,680 --> 00:47:12,754
- And Suzi told us that you play music.
- Yes, I do piano.

424
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:16,232
That's lovely! You'll have to play
something for us some time.

425
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:18,631
I'd gladly do. Do
you have a piano?

426
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:20,535
No. We don't.

427
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,250
James is gonna take over
the farm someday.

428
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,358
That's great. That's very admirable.
Keeping the family business going.

429
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:33,379
A lot of kids these days they want
nothing to do with tradition.

430
00:47:33,403 --> 00:47:36,203
As soon as they graduate
school, they're gone.

431
00:47:36,280 --> 00:47:37,394
So true.

432
00:47:37,418 --> 00:47:40,018
It's good to hear you'll be staying
in the area the long term. I mean,

433
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:42,959
We wouldn't want you to whisk our
daughter to God knows where!

434
00:47:42,983 --> 00:47:45,059
- Dad!
- Stop it, you gonna scare him.

435
00:47:45,060 --> 00:47:47,540
Come on he knows I'm
joking, right James?

436
00:47:47,640 --> 00:47:49,031
Yes, sir.

437
00:47:49,055 --> 00:47:51,855
I mean, come on, it's not like
I've mentioned their children.

438
00:47:53,480 --> 00:47:56,871
What do you feel about children?
You want some some day?

439
00:47:58,560 --> 00:48:00,494
It's nine o' clock right?

440
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:02,760
Yes.

441
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,996
I'm sorry I have to run. The
dinner was really wonderful.

442
00:48:06,040 --> 00:48:07,990
Thank you so much.

443
00:48:09,560 --> 00:48:11,189
James.

444
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:13,916
James

445
00:48:13,960 --> 00:48:17,053
- Is everything okay?
- Yeah, everything is fine.

446
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:18,294
Are you sure?

447
00:48:18,318 --> 00:48:20,199
I just forgot I had a
thing to do at nine.

448
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:24,938
My dad was just joking around.
- It's fine. I got to run.

449
00:49:01,560 --> 00:49:03,353
How bad is it?

450
00:49:03,360 --> 00:49:05,035
Not bad.

451
00:49:05,400 --> 00:49:09,553
You should start carrying pepper spray.
- I should get out of this town.

452
00:49:10,040 --> 00:49:12,450
Still thinking in
joining the Circus?

453
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:15,280
- That was a good idea.
- Not it wasn't.

454
00:49:15,440 --> 00:49:18,990
I could be the most famous sword
swallower of America at this point.

455
00:49:19,200 --> 00:49:21,278
Why aren't you then?

456
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,350
Because you wouldn't
come with me.

457
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:43,039
Hold on.

458
00:49:45,960 --> 00:49:47,476
Thanks.

459
00:49:49,400 --> 00:49:50,916
Sure.

460
00:49:51,960 --> 00:49:53,776
See you tomorrow?

461
00:51:11,160 --> 00:51:15,871
What you felt for your boyfriend,
wasn't love. It was lust.

462
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:19,139
- You don't know that.
- Love is different.

463
00:51:19,560 --> 00:51:22,229
Think about your parents right now.
Your mothers and your fathers.

464
00:51:22,240 --> 00:51:24,597
Think about how
they make you feel.

465
00:51:25,320 --> 00:51:26,715
That is love.

466
00:51:26,720 --> 00:51:31,511
Now think about someone of
the same sex you're attracted to.

467
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:34,959
It's the same feeling?

468
00:51:36,280 --> 00:51:39,910
Sometimes we remember things the way we prefer
them to be not the way they actually were.

469
00:51:40,120 --> 00:51:43,379
The way you describe your relationship,
when you and your boyfriend were together

470
00:51:43,403 --> 00:51:45,603
You could hardly keep
your clothes on.

471
00:51:45,680 --> 00:51:47,712
That's not true love.

472
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:50,811
There's nothing pure or
beautiful about that it's lust.

473
00:51:50,835 --> 00:51:53,035
Pleasures of the flesh.

474
00:51:53,120 --> 00:51:55,593
If you would run into your
boyfriend again right now,

475
00:51:55,617 --> 00:51:58,117
You would probably
yearn to be with him.

476
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:04,355
You would want him to touch you, hug you,
kiss you. But that's the devil's influence.

477
00:52:04,360 --> 00:52:08,439
Sin is very attractive. You
have to fight against it.

478
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,571
It's different with girls?

479
00:52:13,080 --> 00:52:14,396
Sometimes.

480
00:52:14,440 --> 00:52:18,659
Sure, you can lust after girls but
you can also fall in love with one,

481
00:52:18,760 --> 00:52:21,798
And believe me, that's
worth waiting for.

482
00:52:22,040 --> 00:52:26,637
You can't fall in love with
a man, it is impossible.

483
00:52:27,480 --> 00:52:29,558
How do you know?

484
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,437
My father told me.

485
00:52:34,360 --> 00:52:36,230
Right here.

486
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:40,771
You follow this and you'll
know the difference.

487
00:53:29,960 --> 00:53:32,053
Fuck! Goddammit!

488
00:53:32,120 --> 00:53:34,596
- Having trouble?
- What the hell it looks like?

489
00:53:34,600 --> 00:53:37,115
What is it?

490
00:53:38,560 --> 00:53:41,056
Those yankees came back
again this morning.

491
00:53:42,240 --> 00:53:44,796
- Who?
- The ones trying to buy the farm.

492
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,598
- I thought you told them no.
- I did.

493
00:53:49,800 --> 00:53:52,918
They thought maybe I'd changed my
mind they gave me a better offer.

494
00:53:53,120 --> 00:53:55,516
- How much?
- It doesn't matter.

495
00:53:55,600 --> 00:53:58,115
- I'm just curious.
- Not enough.

496
00:53:58,600 --> 00:54:02,276
- This place worths more than money.
- Yeah, but how much money?

497
00:54:02,440 --> 00:54:04,254
Seven-fifty.

498
00:54:07,120 --> 00:54:09,751
$ 750,000?

499
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:14,351
- Dad why did you say no?
- I told you.

500
00:54:14,520 --> 00:54:17,072
No with that kind of money you
could do whatever you want I -

501
00:54:17,096 --> 00:54:19,479
I told you I'm not selling it!
I could go to school for godsake!

502
00:54:19,580 --> 00:54:21,638
James I'm not gonna discuss
it anymore, alright?

503
00:54:21,662 --> 00:54:23,862
You got chores to
do. Go do them.

504
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,776
Now!

505
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:31,895
Jesus.

506
00:54:32,080 --> 00:54:34,099
Come on you son of a bitch.

507
00:55:34,720 --> 00:55:39,556
Play the one your
mom used to play.

508
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,456
You would like to
hear that one again.

509
00:56:03,960 --> 00:56:05,876
Please.

510
00:56:11,755 --> 00:56:13,838
He don't even consider
what I want.

511
00:56:13,862 --> 00:56:16,462
All he cares is about is a
stupid family tradition.

512
00:56:17,400 --> 00:56:20,074
- It's your family's.
- I don't care about.

513
00:56:20,760 --> 00:56:23,912
With that kind of money
I could do anything.

514
00:56:26,400 --> 00:56:28,671
I guess there's one
thing left to do.

515
00:56:30,200 --> 00:56:32,250
We have to kill him.

516
00:56:35,200 --> 00:56:37,350
- That's not funny.
- It was a little funny.

517
00:56:37,374 --> 00:56:39,374
No. It wasn't.

518
00:56:39,480 --> 00:56:43,520
Seriously though. I don't think
your dad should run your life.

519
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:45,635
What other choice do I have?

520
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:48,155
Tons. You have
nothing but choices.

521
00:56:48,360 --> 00:56:51,314
So he won't make it easier for you?
Big deal. We've do it on your own.

522
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:54,358
- It's too hard.
- Poor of you it's too hard.

523
00:56:54,560 --> 00:56:57,792
So life is rough for a few
years. Then it'll be great.

524
00:56:58,040 --> 00:57:02,876
Or you can just sit here, do what you're
told stay here and be miserable.

525
00:57:23,960 --> 00:57:26,695
- Thanks for the ride.
- You're welcome.

526
00:57:28,120 --> 00:57:32,558
- If you want something for it?
- No, don't worry about it.

527
00:57:33,800 --> 00:57:37,396
Why don't we grab something
to eat some time? As friends.

528
00:57:37,600 --> 00:57:40,210
Nothing more. I promise.

529
00:57:47,680 --> 00:57:49,196
When?

530
00:57:50,160 --> 00:57:52,377
I'm free Saturday night.

531
00:57:58,520 --> 00:58:00,136
Alright.

532
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:04,376
Okay.

533
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:08,333
Pick me at six?

534
00:58:14,160 --> 00:58:15,876
See you.

535
00:58:43,716 --> 00:58:45,833
SUZI

536
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:18,770
Good?

537
00:59:20,480 --> 00:59:21,996
Yeah.

538
00:59:23,600 --> 00:59:26,559
My dad has been teaching
himself how to cook.

539
00:59:26,760 --> 00:59:28,240
He's huh...

540
00:59:28,400 --> 00:59:30,419
Sort of bad now actually.

541
00:59:30,600 --> 00:59:33,035
See? Doesn't need you.

542
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:40,255
He needs my help on the farm.

543
00:59:44,480 --> 00:59:46,238
My mom would have
wanted me to stay.

544
00:59:46,262 --> 00:59:48,662
Your mom would want
you to live your life.

545
01:00:13,360 --> 01:00:15,792
How was it like there?

546
01:00:22,360 --> 01:00:25,599
My dad found a place online.

547
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:36,200
I don't think it was what
he was looking for, but...

548
01:00:37,520 --> 01:00:42,515
I think he knew that they
were Christian therapists...

549
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:47,914
It was always a big part
of my mother's life.

550
01:00:53,400 --> 01:00:55,731
It seemed so bad at first.

551
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:59,716
I had a lot of grief and anger.

552
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,652
I was mad at god
and my mother...

553
01:01:05,320 --> 01:01:08,213
It helped me to get pass that.

554
01:01:13,720 --> 01:01:17,557
And they said if I wanted someone to
blame I really had to blame myself.

555
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:24,313
They said that sometimes ...

556
01:01:24,320 --> 01:01:26,536
If our lives aren't according
to god's plan,

557
01:01:26,560 --> 01:01:29,160
He send us a sign to
get us back on track.

558
01:01:33,840 --> 01:01:36,514
How can you believe that?

559
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:38,474
I started to.

560
01:01:57,120 --> 01:01:59,398
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

561
01:02:00,640 --> 01:02:03,153
You're still as fast
as you used to be?

562
01:02:03,177 --> 01:02:04,977
What?

563
01:02:15,560 --> 01:02:17,276
What the hell!

564
01:03:03,400 --> 01:03:05,073
Hey, hey.

565
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:06,850
This way.

566
01:04:18,785 --> 01:04:21,767
James, will you sleep all day?

567
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:00,556
James!

568
01:05:59,320 --> 01:06:01,357
- Not yet.
- I'm sorry.

569
01:06:02,520 --> 01:06:06,719
- What time is it?
- I don't know.

570
01:06:12,480 --> 01:06:14,995
- We should get up.
- No. - Yes.

571
01:06:15,200 --> 01:06:17,590
- Before my dad wakes up.
- No.

572
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:19,853
- And kill us.
- No.

573
01:06:20,720 --> 01:06:21,870
No.

574
01:06:33,320 --> 01:06:34,890
- Hi.
- Hi.

575
01:06:43,760 --> 01:06:46,755
- I really missed you.
- I missed you too.

576
01:06:55,160 --> 01:06:56,874
- Who the hell is that?
- Suzi!

577
01:06:59,120 --> 01:07:01,273
Suzi! Suzi, wait!

578
01:07:03,080 --> 01:07:04,396
Suzi!

579
01:07:05,040 --> 01:07:08,412
- Wait, I'm sorry.
- You bastard!

580
01:07:08,480 --> 01:07:10,080
- You're a bastard!
- Wait!

581
01:07:10,080 --> 01:07:12,531
- Don't touch me!
- You listen to me?

582
01:07:12,600 --> 01:07:16,116
You know what you are? You're
disgusting. You're pathetic.

583
01:07:16,120 --> 01:07:18,000
Burn in hell!

584
01:07:25,600 --> 01:07:27,978
- You're okay?
- Yeah.

585
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:30,836
I'm fine.

586
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,315
James.

587
01:07:40,800 --> 01:07:42,739
- Wait in the truck.
- Yeah.

588
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:05,275
Listen, it did look pretty bad.

589
01:08:06,400 --> 01:08:10,599
I had to break up with Suzi just
now and Charlie is a friend from-

590
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,654
Just stop!

591
01:08:16,120 --> 01:08:19,113
I honestly have no
idea what to do.

592
01:08:19,680 --> 01:08:24,277
Maybe if your mother was here
she would know but I have no idea.

593
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:28,919
- About what?
- About you.

594
01:08:30,480 --> 01:08:32,915
About how to help you.

595
01:08:38,320 --> 01:08:39,794
Help me with what?

596
01:08:39,818 --> 01:08:42,618
To help you grow up,
help you to be a man.

597
01:08:44,560 --> 01:08:47,375
- I am a man.
- Yeah, you're one hell of a man.

598
01:08:51,360 --> 01:08:53,130
Go ahead.

599
01:08:53,160 --> 01:08:54,676
Say it.

600
01:08:57,840 --> 01:08:59,790
Go ahead and say it.

601
01:08:59,960 --> 01:09:02,475
No come on I want you to.

602
01:09:04,520 --> 01:09:06,236
That's okay.

603
01:09:07,290 --> 01:09:11,857
You were never the kind of man
I wanted for a father either.

604
01:09:17,920 --> 01:09:20,774
Mom saw you now she'd be
ashamed you know that?

605
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:22,615
That makes two of us I guess.

606
01:09:22,639 --> 01:09:24,639
I guess.

607
01:09:44,320 --> 01:09:46,698
Well, look who
the cat dragged in?

608
01:09:46,760 --> 01:09:49,400
I haven't seen you
a while Ricky.

609
01:09:59,040 --> 01:10:04,313
- Awfully early to be pissed drunk.
- You want my money or not?

610
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,675
I saw your boy in here a while
back with a pretty girl.

611
01:10:09,680 --> 01:10:12,639
He isn't my boy.
I didn't know him.

612
01:10:12,840 --> 01:10:16,120
I'm sure every father said that about
their boy some point or another.

613
01:10:16,144 --> 01:10:17,479
Bulshit!

614
01:10:17,580 --> 01:10:20,300
I minded my old man.

615
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:25,192
Didn't you tell me one time about when
you were 17 you wanted to run away?

616
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:27,490
Cause your old man wouldn't
let you join in the army?

617
01:10:27,514 --> 01:10:29,399
You don't remember as
well as you think you do.

618
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:30,875
- Oh no?
- No.

619
01:10:31,400 --> 01:10:34,120
I was eighteen and
it was the Marines.

620
01:10:34,440 --> 01:10:36,650
And I would made
a damn fine one too.

621
01:10:36,674 --> 01:10:38,874
Of course you would.

622
01:10:39,960 --> 01:10:43,153
- You ever think about that?
- What the Mariners?

623
01:10:43,480 --> 01:10:47,997
Seeing the world, never know
where you have ended up.

624
01:10:49,120 --> 01:10:51,794
You don't always get
what you wanted.

625
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:57,977
So I heard there's this
really nice couple

626
01:10:58,001 --> 01:10:59,919
Looking around town lately.

627
01:10:59,920 --> 01:11:02,330
Looking to buy some land.
Have they up to see you?

628
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:03,795
They have.

629
01:11:03,800 --> 01:11:05,873
How was their offer?

630
01:11:05,960 --> 01:11:07,576
Insufficient.

631
01:11:09,000 --> 01:11:10,716
That is a shame.

632
01:11:11,560 --> 01:11:15,349
If it was more you might be
able to get their apple business.

633
01:11:15,760 --> 01:11:17,679
Live a little.

634
01:11:17,680 --> 01:11:19,799
I'm not a young man anymore.

635
01:11:19,800 --> 01:11:21,871
But you're not worn out either.

636
01:11:30,240 --> 01:11:32,020
See you around.

637
01:11:32,160 --> 01:11:35,080
Take care, Ricky.
Don't be a stranger.

638
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:29,376
What about your dad?

639
01:13:32,040 --> 01:13:33,556
I don't know.

640
01:13:36,680 --> 01:13:39,659
- I don't think I can go home.
- You think he'll hurt you?

641
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,474
No... no.

642
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:48,156
I just don't think he wants
me there anymore.

643
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:50,414
You can stay with me.

644
01:13:52,960 --> 01:13:55,550
It's not a permanent solution.

645
01:13:57,120 --> 01:13:58,415
So we leave.

646
01:13:58,480 --> 01:13:59,896
Yeah?

647
01:14:01,000 --> 01:14:02,750
Where would we go?

648
01:14:03,320 --> 01:14:04,790
I don't know.

649
01:14:05,520 --> 01:14:07,339
The circus?

650
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,233
I'll just go in.

651
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:17,630
Pack my clothes,
what else I need.

652
01:14:18,400 --> 01:14:20,170
Then leave.

653
01:14:26,440 --> 01:14:28,513
And then the circus.

654
01:14:29,240 --> 01:14:30,656
Okay?

655
01:14:53,560 --> 01:14:55,174
Right. Here it go.

656
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,890
- Thank you.
- You're welcome. Have a great day.

657
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:00,074
- Hey, Rich.
- Hey.

658
01:15:00,280 --> 01:15:03,000
- How's the apple business?
- It's fine, it's fine.

659
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:06,393
- Listen, I'm sorry I'm so late.
- Don't worry about it. I'll get your receipt.

660
01:15:06,400 --> 01:15:07,870
Thanks.

661
01:15:21,680 --> 01:15:24,593
<i>100% Organic</i>

662
01:15:27,320 --> 01:15:29,691
- Excuse me.
- Sure.

663
01:15:35,360 --> 01:15:36,830
Here it go.

664
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:41,439
- So a lot of folks go for the organic?
- Yeah, actually they're very popular.

665
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:45,331
Let's see Winston Clark switched
to organic. You know Winston?

666
01:15:45,400 --> 01:15:46,716
Yeah.

667
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,873
The Shelley's also went
to the organic.

668
01:15:52,160 --> 01:15:54,119
- See you later.
- Hmm.

669
01:15:54,400 --> 01:15:56,378
Hi. How can I help you?

670
01:15:56,642 --> 01:15:57,940
That's all?

671
01:15:57,960 --> 01:15:59,376
Good.

672
01:16:01,280 --> 01:16:03,033
It's all $ 11.

673
01:19:42,960 --> 01:19:44,892
You play better than she did.

674
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:48,996
- I was... - James...
- I was just leaving.

675
01:19:49,400 --> 01:19:52,672
- I don't really want to talk about it.
- Just wait. Just wait.

676
01:19:53,999 --> 01:19:56,182
Sit down. Please.

677
01:19:56,967 --> 01:19:59,028
For a minute.

678
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:12,210
Where you're going?

679
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:17,572
- I was thinking of going to Boston.
- Alone?

680
01:20:18,560 --> 01:20:20,076
No.

681
01:20:25,050 --> 01:20:27,459
Is he... What's his name again?

682
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,440
- Charlie.
- Charlie.

683
01:20:31,280 --> 01:20:33,513
Is he the one from before?

684
01:20:35,080 --> 01:20:36,596
Yeah.

685
01:20:41,920 --> 01:20:45,072
Your mother and I were pretty
concerned about that.

686
01:20:45,280 --> 01:20:47,762
So you ended up at that place.

687
01:20:47,961 --> 01:20:49,776
I'm sorry about that.

688
01:20:56,669 --> 01:20:58,396
You care about each other?

689
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:02,656
Yeah.

690
01:21:03,680 --> 01:21:05,801
We do. Very much.

691
01:21:08,160 --> 01:21:09,676
That's good.

692
01:21:13,280 --> 01:21:17,911
I want to apologize for what I
said yesterday. That wasn't right.

693
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:21,160
I don't know If I'll ever
understand it but.

694
01:21:22,160 --> 01:21:25,910
I think I can do a better
job of accepting it.

695
01:21:31,720 --> 01:21:33,415
Thank you.

696
01:21:39,480 --> 01:21:41,751
I decided to sell the farm.

697
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:48,060
- What?
- I took the offer.

698
01:21:48,960 --> 01:21:50,655
Why? Why would you...?

699
01:21:50,679 --> 01:21:54,079
You know I've been running this place
for the last 20 years for my dad

700
01:21:54,160 --> 01:21:56,750
When I should have been
running it for you.

701
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:02,676
I'll give you some of the money you can
go to school, move away, whatever you want.

702
01:22:03,320 --> 01:22:05,880
I guess, I guess I'll retire.

703
01:22:06,760 --> 01:22:08,310
Anyway.

704
01:22:08,680 --> 01:22:11,912
The farm isn't family we are.

705
01:22:17,840 --> 01:22:20,350
Dad I'm sorry that things
didn't really work out.

706
01:22:20,374 --> 01:22:21,999
Don't.

707
01:22:22,000 --> 01:22:23,944
That's life.

708
01:22:25,486 --> 01:22:27,917
We just do the best
we can, okay?

709
01:22:31,320 --> 01:22:32,790
Okay.
