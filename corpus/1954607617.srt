1
00:01:11,446 --> 00:01:13,281
Come on, it's my turn.

2
00:01:15,116 --> 00:01:17,869
- It's my turn.
- I don't care, you've had it forever.

3
00:01:18,078 --> 00:01:19,329
You're not playing fair!

4
00:01:19,537 --> 00:01:20,914
Don't be a sore loser.

5
00:01:26,753 --> 00:01:29,506
If you cannot argue constructively,
what will Mother do?

6
00:01:29,673 --> 00:01:31,049
Destroy our video games.

7
00:01:33,968 --> 00:01:35,011
Andrew...?

8
00:01:36,179 --> 00:01:37,806
And the gaming system.

9
00:01:38,014 --> 00:01:39,224
Burn it while we watch.

10
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:43,144
That's right. Don't forget
what happened to your Legos.

11
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,993
Well, you get me somebody
that's authorized to say yes...

12
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:24,245
...or I'm gonna find
another finance company.

13
00:03:24,412 --> 00:03:25,455
And that's the truth.

14
00:03:25,622 --> 00:03:28,416
I got a three thousand dollar order.
The numbers look good.

15
00:03:28,625 --> 00:03:31,461
He's already pre-approved,
plus we got everything in stock.

16
00:03:31,628 --> 00:03:32,629
Great.

17
00:03:35,465 --> 00:03:36,549
Hello.

18
00:03:43,848 --> 00:03:45,725
- Hello?
- Come in.

19
00:03:48,687 --> 00:03:50,146
Can I help you?

20
00:03:50,313 --> 00:03:52,232
I'm here about the job posting
on Craigslist.

21
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,484
- Wonderful.
- "Energetic people person...

22
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:56,569
...who is a well-oiled selling machine...

23
00:03:56,736 --> 00:04:00,365
...that wants to better civilization
through the fine furniture of the world."

24
00:04:00,532 --> 00:04:02,701
I didn't write it. But it is good.

25
00:04:03,326 --> 00:04:05,036
- Don Champagne.
- Dusty.

26
00:04:05,203 --> 00:04:08,039
Hi, Dusty. Welcome to
Champagne Furniture and Rugs.

27
00:04:08,206 --> 00:04:09,332
Thank you.

28
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,210
Would you like to sit down?

29
00:04:12,377 --> 00:04:13,837
- I would love to.
- Great.

30
00:04:18,842 --> 00:04:22,679
So, what kind of jobs do you give? Had.

31
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,611
Yeah, baby! She's the one, boss.

32
00:04:38,778 --> 00:04:40,947
Well, you know....

33
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:44,200
- I'll review all the applications tonight.
- We need this.

34
00:04:44,409 --> 00:04:45,744
We don't need this.

35
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,204
Come on.
You know my wife has Crohn's.

36
00:04:49,205 --> 00:04:53,543
She cries all day.
And violent bowel movements. It's horrific.

37
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:57,047
Oh, I'm sorry. But what's your point?

38
00:04:57,297 --> 00:04:58,882
Point? Eye candy!

39
00:05:00,467 --> 00:05:02,469
We need something to look at
during the day.

40
00:05:02,635 --> 00:05:04,804
Something to take our minds
off that suffering.

41
00:05:04,971 --> 00:05:07,265
- You should know better than anybody.
- All right.

42
00:05:07,432 --> 00:05:08,475
Look at that.

43
00:05:09,059 --> 00:05:11,311
All right, well... Okay.

44
00:05:15,607 --> 00:05:17,150
- Hi.
- Hello.

45
00:05:22,072 --> 00:05:23,573
Did you find someone?

46
00:05:24,282 --> 00:05:25,325
Maybe.

47
00:05:25,575 --> 00:05:26,743
What's his name?

48
00:05:28,745 --> 00:05:29,788
Dusty.

49
00:05:31,122 --> 00:05:32,624
Not another Mexican, is it?

50
00:05:33,083 --> 00:05:34,918
You know what Daddy says,
"Hire a Jew."

51
00:05:35,293 --> 00:05:36,503
All they do is make money.

52
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,173
Yes. I know...

53
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:47,681
No. It's not a Mexican.

54
00:05:48,264 --> 00:05:50,767
Speaking of my parents,
they're gonna swing by here...

55
00:05:50,934 --> 00:05:53,186
...on their roadtrip
for Andrew's birthday party.

56
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:54,479
So....

57
00:05:54,646 --> 00:05:56,439
You're gonna need to work on the lawn.

58
00:05:57,941 --> 00:05:59,234
What's wrong with the lawn?

59
00:05:59,401 --> 00:06:02,112
Oh, Daddy wouldn't approve
of those hedges.

60
00:06:03,822 --> 00:06:05,156
Well, it's not his lawn.

61
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,075
Well....

62
00:06:07,242 --> 00:06:11,955
He did help pay for the house, Don,
so I guess that makes it partially his lawn.

63
00:06:14,165 --> 00:06:15,709
Does he partially own the kids...

64
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:18,169
...because he pitches in
for their private school?

65
00:06:19,295 --> 00:06:20,964
He just wants what's best for them.

66
00:06:22,632 --> 00:06:23,633
And I don't?

67
00:06:24,884 --> 00:06:26,136
Of course you do.

68
00:06:42,485 --> 00:06:45,488
You're gonna dress like that
and we're gonna review your goals?

69
00:06:45,947 --> 00:06:46,990
Our goals.

70
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,577
Now....

71
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,164
We need this retreat in Florida.

72
00:06:55,915 --> 00:06:58,668
A second store in Shady Springs.

73
00:06:59,961 --> 00:07:02,881
And we need to move to
the Wildwood Collection by next Summer.

74
00:07:03,757 --> 00:07:06,676
We're gonna achieve our goals, Don...

75
00:07:06,843 --> 00:07:09,846
...because we have standards
and strategy.

76
00:07:10,638 --> 00:07:12,057
Now, focus!

77
00:07:12,432 --> 00:07:17,020
It's hard to stay focused
when I've got this healthy erection.

78
00:07:19,022 --> 00:07:22,734
We will have sex on the 9th...

79
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:24,944
...as scheduled.

80
00:07:25,403 --> 00:07:28,698
Until then you can take care of yourself.

81
00:07:35,538 --> 00:07:37,916
What if I just slide it
between your butt cheeks?

82
00:07:38,958 --> 00:07:40,293
No penetration.

83
00:07:43,463 --> 00:07:46,049
We will have sex on the 9th,
as scheduled.

84
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:47,967
And you need to work out.

85
00:07:48,134 --> 00:07:50,595
You looked a little bloated
in the last commercial.

86
00:07:55,934 --> 00:07:58,937
- Love you.
- More than the moon and the stars?

87
00:07:59,854 --> 00:08:01,731
More than the moon and the stars.

88
00:08:02,899 --> 00:08:06,569
One, two. One, two, One....

89
00:08:22,877 --> 00:08:24,254
What?

90
00:08:24,504 --> 00:08:28,258
Already? That's impressive.
I don't think I've ever seen anyone...

91
00:08:36,683 --> 00:08:39,436
They don't need to finance
and they asked for rush delivery.

92
00:08:39,602 --> 00:08:40,854
So, what do they want?

93
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:43,148
Just a chocolate La-Z-Boy recliner.

94
00:08:43,356 --> 00:08:45,900
Hey, hey, hey! A sale is a sale.

95
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:47,444
Better to be lucky than good.

96
00:08:47,944 --> 00:08:52,157
That's a great saying.
There's no luck needed, though.

97
00:08:52,532 --> 00:08:55,201
I was watching you out there.
You're a natural.

98
00:08:58,788 --> 00:09:00,790
Don't pop this inside.

99
00:09:05,670 --> 00:09:07,380
I like it when you watch me.

100
00:09:12,302 --> 00:09:13,678
You do...?

101
00:09:24,856 --> 00:09:26,191
Who am I speaking with?

102
00:09:26,358 --> 00:09:28,818
Dagmarro? That's a nice name.
What is that, Canadian?

103
00:09:29,736 --> 00:09:32,238
This is Don Champagne
of Champagne Furniture and Rugs.

104
00:09:32,405 --> 00:09:34,324
We've got a little bit of a problem here.

105
00:09:34,491 --> 00:09:36,701
I ordered
an espresso Modernica in a pull-out...

106
00:09:36,868 --> 00:09:38,745
...and you sent it to me in a sectional.

107
00:10:04,020 --> 00:10:06,981
<i>...Scrooge had no further dealings
with ghosts...</i>

108
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:10,777
<i>...but it was always said
he knew how to keep Christmas well...</i>

109
00:10:10,944 --> 00:10:14,322
<i>...if any man alive
possessed the knowledge....</i>

110
00:10:14,781 --> 00:10:16,866
Jump in the shower
and clean yourself up.

111
00:10:19,452 --> 00:10:21,788
<i>"So as Tiny Tim observed....</i>

112
00:10:22,789 --> 00:10:25,125
<i>'God bless us, everyone.'"</i>

113
00:10:32,048 --> 00:10:34,217
<i>Collector of the finer things in life?</i>

114
00:10:34,884 --> 00:10:37,470
<i>Exclusive art? Italian leather?</i>

115
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,097
I'll leave your cut on the bed.

116
00:10:39,264 --> 00:10:42,726
<i>Handwoven rugs?
Maybe even a rare floor lamp?</i>

117
00:10:43,226 --> 00:10:46,062
<i>Well, look no further
than Champagne Furniture and Rugs...</i>

118
00:10:46,229 --> 00:10:48,940
<i>...where we carry the coolest,
sleekest furniture...</i>

119
00:10:49,107 --> 00:10:51,443
<i>...for your home, office, or yacht.</i>

120
00:10:52,068 --> 00:10:54,904
<i>Come on down and let our family...</i>

121
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:57,532
<i>...here at
Champagne Furniture and Rugs...</i>

122
00:10:57,699 --> 00:11:01,244
<i>...fill your furnishing desires.</i>

123
00:11:01,828 --> 00:11:04,831
<i>I'm Don Champagne, tastemaker.</i>

124
00:11:05,582 --> 00:11:07,834
<i>And the pleasure is all mine.</i>

125
00:11:28,438 --> 00:11:29,939
How are the French lessons?

126
00:11:33,777 --> 00:11:36,738
They are... kind?

127
00:11:39,866 --> 00:11:42,535
And how about you, Allison?
What have you learned?

128
00:11:44,287 --> 00:11:49,292
It's a... beautiful, difficult,
and interesting language.

129
00:11:49,501 --> 00:11:53,129
But with adequate time and study...

130
00:11:53,296 --> 00:11:56,883
I will easily become accomplished.

131
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:58,635
I have no doubt, darling.

132
00:11:59,469 --> 00:12:01,513
Just make sure
you work with your brother.

133
00:12:03,723 --> 00:12:06,810
Oh, and make sure your clothes
are ironed before school tomorrow.

134
00:12:07,268 --> 00:12:10,814
You must look better than everyone else,
always. No exceptions.

135
00:12:11,231 --> 00:12:12,273
Perception is key.

136
00:12:12,482 --> 00:12:13,817
Perception is everything.

137
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:15,985
Can I go play X-Box now?

138
00:12:16,152 --> 00:12:19,364
"May" we, not "can" we. And yes.

139
00:12:21,199 --> 00:12:22,492
Andrew?

140
00:12:26,329 --> 00:12:27,539
Thank you, Ally.

141
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:30,875
Good job, buddy.

142
00:12:32,961 --> 00:12:34,004
Don....

143
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:36,589
Honey, how was your day?

144
00:12:37,507 --> 00:12:38,675
Same old, same old.

145
00:12:39,384 --> 00:12:40,927
Did the new hire make a sale?

146
00:12:41,386 --> 00:12:42,887
Actually, she did.

147
00:12:50,270 --> 00:12:52,272
Her name is Dusty?

148
00:12:55,191 --> 00:12:57,861
- How old is she?
- I don't know.

149
00:12:58,528 --> 00:13:02,699
She's a single mother.
Just moved here.

150
00:13:02,949 --> 00:13:04,993
Has some....

151
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:06,870
Some very good references.

152
00:13:08,246 --> 00:13:12,083
We're trying to run a business, Don.
Not a day care.

153
00:13:15,295 --> 00:13:16,713
I'm sure she has a babysitter.

154
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:20,550
At least she's not Mexican.

155
00:13:26,598 --> 00:13:28,475
Wow, look at them big old titties.

156
00:13:29,017 --> 00:13:30,060
Yeah.

157
00:13:30,393 --> 00:13:32,729
I bet she keeps it trim for daddy,
doesnâ€™t she.

158
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:36,483
This place....

159
00:13:37,067 --> 00:13:39,235
So we're gonna get rid of all this.
I'm gonna just give it away.

160
00:13:39,444 --> 00:13:41,571
- Well, don't give it away.
- Give it away!

161
00:13:41,738 --> 00:13:44,407
Hi. Les. How are you?
You have beautiful eyes.

162
00:13:44,616 --> 00:13:49,162
You know, this leather is real Italian...
Same color as your eyes. Look at that.

163
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,290
Very comfortable. Very beautiful....

164
00:13:52,499 --> 00:13:56,252
I see you guys eyeing this bad boy.
Let's take it for a ride.

165
00:13:56,461 --> 00:13:59,506
That is a bad boy. All three of them.

166
00:13:59,756 --> 00:14:01,424
- She's gonna take care of you.
- Okay.

167
00:14:01,591 --> 00:14:04,431
How you doing? I'm Don. I'm the owner.
Let me know if you need any help.

168
00:14:04,594 --> 00:14:07,180
Hi. Welcome.
Champagne Furniture and Rugs.

169
00:14:07,764 --> 00:14:09,307
How are you? Pleasure's all mine.

170
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:14,145
- Hey, guys. Okay. Put that in the back.
- In the back?

171
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:16,898
- By the black, round coffee table.
- You got it.

172
00:14:17,941 --> 00:14:19,359
Looking good, looking good.

173
00:14:22,779 --> 00:14:25,782
She must have a little harlot in her
in a dress like that, huh?

174
00:14:25,949 --> 00:14:28,034
You're just saying that
because she's pretty.

175
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:31,287
You think she's pretty?

176
00:14:32,288 --> 00:14:34,833
I think she's what I need on the floor.

177
00:14:35,625 --> 00:14:38,294
Of the showroom. Selling furniture.

178
00:14:39,129 --> 00:14:40,422
Would you like to meet her?

179
00:14:40,839 --> 00:14:41,881
No,

180
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:46,177
No, I want to keep some boundaries
between the power and the help.

181
00:14:47,721 --> 00:14:49,305
- Good decision.
- Yeah.

182
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:52,267
- Back on the floor I go.
- All right.

183
00:14:52,434 --> 00:14:53,810
- You look great.
- Thank you.

184
00:15:05,655 --> 00:15:07,490
- Hey.
- Impressive day.

185
00:15:07,699 --> 00:15:09,242
Red Tag Sales always are.

186
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:11,036
I think you're doing a great job.

187
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:12,662
Daddy does too.

188
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,165
You know how I love his approval.

189
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:19,085
You've come such a long way
from being a used car salesman.

190
00:15:20,337 --> 00:15:21,338
Thank you.

191
00:15:22,172 --> 00:15:23,214
I guess.

192
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:26,259
Want a hand job?

193
00:15:32,223 --> 00:15:33,725
Oh, yeah.

194
00:15:33,892 --> 00:15:35,018
What are you doing?

195
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:37,604
I accept your offer.

196
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:41,566
No, Don, not here.

197
00:15:41,733 --> 00:15:43,568
At home.
I've already put it on the schedule.

198
00:15:44,027 --> 00:15:46,988
Why not here? Mona, we're married.

199
00:15:47,197 --> 00:15:49,366
We are supposed to be a little kinky.

200
00:15:49,532 --> 00:15:52,535
We're supposed to have sex
more than six times a year!

201
00:15:54,037 --> 00:15:57,248
Well, if you wouldn't pressure me....

202
00:15:57,415 --> 00:16:02,170
I am a man, Mona! I have needs!
You obviously do not!

203
00:16:03,713 --> 00:16:06,383
I was trying to be sweet.

204
00:16:09,386 --> 00:16:11,054
Don't come home.

205
00:16:17,560 --> 00:16:20,230
Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

206
00:16:36,705 --> 00:16:40,375
Oh, yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah....

207
00:17:12,824 --> 00:17:14,951
I heard your little fight last night.

208
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,292
Dusty?

209
00:17:24,294 --> 00:17:25,545
What are you...?

210
00:17:26,629 --> 00:17:28,048
You deserve better.

211
00:17:28,798 --> 00:17:30,800
- I do?
- It's not fair.

212
00:17:31,301 --> 00:17:32,886
No, it's not.

213
00:17:33,303 --> 00:17:35,180
Thank you for taking a chance on me.

214
00:17:35,472 --> 00:17:36,806
Oh, okay.

215
00:17:37,057 --> 00:17:38,892
No. No, no, no....

216
00:17:39,976 --> 00:17:43,146
Okay. No, no, no... Oh, no!

217
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:48,485
Oh, no. Oh, no.

218
00:17:48,985 --> 00:17:53,239
Oh, no....

219
00:18:03,708 --> 00:18:06,127
I just touched myself in the bathroom
until I came...

220
00:18:06,670 --> 00:18:09,839
...just thinking about your big, bulging...

221
00:18:10,006 --> 00:18:12,300
- Sorry for the interruption.
- Not at all.

222
00:18:12,717 --> 00:18:13,802
<i>Cock.</i>

223
00:18:14,678 --> 00:18:15,679
- Donny.
- Yeah?

224
00:18:16,054 --> 00:18:17,889
- How about putting some tunes on?
- Sure.

225
00:18:22,352 --> 00:18:23,353
God.

226
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:29,901
- She's cute...
- Stop. I need you to work.

227
00:18:48,712 --> 00:18:50,046
Donny?

228
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:00,640
What?

229
00:19:01,141 --> 00:19:03,143
No, no, no. Dusty, we can't do this.

230
00:19:03,727 --> 00:19:07,105
- Why? Everyone's at lunch.
- No, because this is wrong.

231
00:19:08,481 --> 00:19:11,151
- I want this, and you need this.
- No, but I'm a...

232
00:19:11,818 --> 00:19:15,071
I have a wife and kids,
and this is a family furniture store.

233
00:19:15,238 --> 00:19:16,906
Come on, Donny. Don't make me beg.

234
00:19:17,073 --> 00:19:18,408
I can't, I can't, I can't....

235
00:19:18,616 --> 00:19:20,160
You only live once, Donny.

236
00:19:21,578 --> 00:19:22,746
What are you...?

237
00:19:39,179 --> 00:19:40,263
Oh, don't stop.

238
00:19:55,403 --> 00:19:57,530
Yeah! Yeah!

239
00:20:06,664 --> 00:20:07,707
Yeah!

240
00:20:19,886 --> 00:20:22,138
Pop that champagne inside of me!

241
00:20:22,305 --> 00:20:24,474
- Okay.
- Oh, pop it! Pop it!

242
00:20:27,644 --> 00:20:29,062
Here comes the champagne! Yes!

243
00:20:29,312 --> 00:20:30,689
Give it to me, baby!

244
00:21:59,778 --> 00:22:00,945
Don't over season.

245
00:22:01,237 --> 00:22:02,572
I won't.

246
00:22:03,156 --> 00:22:07,077
And stick to 1/3 pound burgers.
I hate when the meat gets too thick.

247
00:22:08,411 --> 00:22:09,412
I know.

248
00:22:10,914 --> 00:22:12,999
Did you invite Dusty to the party?

249
00:22:14,751 --> 00:22:17,629
She said that she was busy.

250
00:22:19,005 --> 00:22:21,424
Well, she's a liar.

251
00:22:31,101 --> 00:22:32,560
So you're...

252
00:22:34,688 --> 00:22:36,856
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

253
00:22:37,732 --> 00:22:39,567
- Let me... Yeah, yeah.
- You're so sweet.

254
00:22:40,026 --> 00:22:41,528
Thank you.

255
00:22:46,783 --> 00:22:50,203
We finally meet after all this time.

256
00:22:50,453 --> 00:22:52,455
Hi. I have heard so much about you.

257
00:22:53,289 --> 00:22:55,458
Yeah, I said a lot.

258
00:22:55,959 --> 00:22:57,961
I don't usually mingle with
the employees...

259
00:22:58,128 --> 00:23:01,423
...but you are the employee of the month
so that deserves some celebration, no?

260
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:03,383
Where's your kid?

261
00:23:03,633 --> 00:23:04,801
Oh, babysitter.

262
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:09,222
Oh. That's a shame. We love children,

263
00:23:10,974 --> 00:23:12,559
Yes....

264
00:23:13,393 --> 00:23:15,186
I'm glad that you could come.

265
00:23:16,312 --> 00:23:19,691
Today. Here. At our house.

266
00:23:23,236 --> 00:23:26,156
Have a wonderful time.

267
00:23:31,161 --> 00:23:32,787
Oh, God....

268
00:23:37,000 --> 00:23:38,335
Crohn's.

269
00:23:43,214 --> 00:23:44,341
Hey.

270
00:23:44,966 --> 00:23:46,009
You sexy thing...

271
00:23:46,176 --> 00:23:47,886
What are you doing here, Dusty?
You cannot be here.

272
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:49,929
What's the big deal? We work together.

273
00:23:50,096 --> 00:23:51,556
The big deal...?

274
00:23:52,349 --> 00:23:55,852
Mona senses everything.
She's very perceptive. It's fucking eerie.

275
00:23:56,019 --> 00:23:57,419
Oh, no. She's doesn't know a thing.

276
00:23:57,437 --> 00:23:59,197
Listen, just go.
Make up something and leave.

277
00:23:59,356 --> 00:24:02,108
- I want to ask you something first, okay?
- Okay, go.

278
00:24:03,109 --> 00:24:05,403
- Do you care for me?
- Yeah. What? What?

279
00:24:05,695 --> 00:24:06,905
Do you care for me?

280
00:24:07,280 --> 00:24:10,033
More than the moon and the stars.

281
00:24:10,450 --> 00:24:12,869
- That's really good to know.
- Great. Now can you go?

282
00:24:13,078 --> 00:24:16,373
You've gotta leave now.
This is my family time. My family is here.

283
00:24:17,207 --> 00:24:19,959
Don, I'm pregnant.

284
00:24:24,381 --> 00:24:26,925
- I don't have time for this.
- Three tests.

285
00:24:27,092 --> 00:24:29,052
But how long have we been...?

286
00:24:29,386 --> 00:24:32,347
When you... No. You're not on the pill?

287
00:24:33,348 --> 00:24:34,391
How can you not be on the pill?

288
00:24:34,557 --> 00:24:37,602
What happened to "Pop that champagne
inside of me, Don"?

289
00:24:37,769 --> 00:24:39,049
I wasn't supposed to be able to.

290
00:24:39,187 --> 00:24:40,667
There were
only a couple days a month.

291
00:24:40,730 --> 00:24:44,651
It's okay.
Okay. So, what are we gonna do?

292
00:24:44,818 --> 00:24:46,820
We gonna be adults about this?
We're gonna...

293
00:24:46,986 --> 00:24:48,697
- I wanna have it.
- You wanna have it.

294
00:24:48,863 --> 00:24:51,663
- What do you mean, you wanna have it?
- I promise I won't tell anyone.

295
00:24:54,411 --> 00:24:56,204
Oh, my God, I think I'm gonna be sick.

296
00:25:02,585 --> 00:25:05,547
If Mona finds out, she'll take everything.

297
00:25:06,423 --> 00:25:08,299
The kids, the store, everything.

298
00:25:08,633 --> 00:25:09,843
She may even kill you.

299
00:25:13,930 --> 00:25:15,098
Hey.

300
00:25:16,433 --> 00:25:19,519
Why don't you try to pay Dusty off?
You know? Give her some money.

301
00:25:19,936 --> 00:25:22,772
Well, she seems like the kind of girl
into that sort of thing.

302
00:25:22,939 --> 00:25:24,357
What do you mean?

303
00:25:24,524 --> 00:25:27,736
- Well, she's, you know, loose.
- What did you say?

304
00:25:27,902 --> 00:25:29,487
Well, she's doing you
all over the furniture store.

305
00:25:29,696 --> 00:25:32,449
Maybe she's got the mind
to take some money.

306
00:25:32,615 --> 00:25:35,744
No. No. How much?

307
00:25:38,288 --> 00:25:39,414
Flatter her.

308
00:25:40,373 --> 00:25:41,499
Seven grand.

309
00:25:42,292 --> 00:25:44,127
Where? I don't have seven grand.

310
00:25:44,294 --> 00:25:46,338
I got seven grand. I saved up.

311
00:25:46,838 --> 00:25:50,175
I mean, it's in CDs and other
financial instruments...

312
00:25:50,342 --> 00:25:51,801
...but it would be a loan.

313
00:25:53,303 --> 00:25:57,474
That's very generous of you.
Doesn't seem like much of a payoff.

314
00:25:58,016 --> 00:26:00,352
It's a lot of money, seven grand,
in America today.

315
00:26:00,518 --> 00:26:02,878
I'm not saying it's not a lot of money.
I'm just thinking...

316
00:26:02,896 --> 00:26:06,358
...if you were to bribe someone,
I don't know if seven grand is the right...

317
00:26:06,524 --> 00:26:07,859
Well, how much you got?

318
00:26:08,026 --> 00:26:10,320
I got six grand.

319
00:26:10,487 --> 00:26:14,199
That's thirteen grand. She'll take that.
Come on, who wouldn't take that?

320
00:26:17,577 --> 00:26:21,664
Sex with Don!!! 9:30PM - 9:45PM
*wear the new lace panties*

321
00:26:21,831 --> 00:26:23,583
I can tell you've been working out.

322
00:26:29,089 --> 00:26:30,674
What are you doing?

323
00:26:30,882 --> 00:26:32,092
Fondling you.

324
00:26:32,509 --> 00:26:33,510
Please don't.

325
00:26:34,427 --> 00:26:39,182
<i>If I ask a simple question
Do you promise to be true?</i>

326
00:26:40,058 --> 00:26:41,518
I'm really not in the mood.

327
00:26:41,935 --> 00:26:46,606
<i>Swear to me you'll listen
As I whisper this to you</i>

328
00:26:48,024 --> 00:26:51,528
<i>How much do you love me?
How much do you care?</i>

329
00:26:53,196 --> 00:26:56,282
<i>- Spare me no details, my sweet
- Spare me no details, my sweet</i>

330
00:26:56,533 --> 00:26:59,202
<i>- My little cuddle-bear
- My little cuddle-bear</i>

331
00:26:59,619 --> 00:27:03,123
<i>More than the moon
And the stars up above</i>

332
00:27:03,373 --> 00:27:06,543
I... You know, I can't, really.
I just... I don't really feel great.

333
00:27:07,711 --> 00:27:08,878
Love you.

334
00:28:29,376 --> 00:28:30,502
Hello?

335
00:28:49,145 --> 00:28:50,522
You're so pretty.

336
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:56,986
You scared me.

337
00:28:59,531 --> 00:29:01,366
I can fucking taste him on you.

338
00:29:03,326 --> 00:29:04,661
In the fucking bedroom!

339
00:29:08,998 --> 00:29:11,459
- Do you wanna sit down or...?
- That's okay.

340
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:17,340
Look, I just wanted to let you know...

341
00:29:18,258 --> 00:29:20,677
...that I found a specialist out of town.

342
00:29:20,885 --> 00:29:21,928
A specialist?

343
00:29:22,095 --> 00:29:23,179
I have a small uterus.

344
00:29:24,514 --> 00:29:26,683
So I guess
you're still going through with it.

345
00:29:28,685 --> 00:29:29,728
Listen....

346
00:29:32,022 --> 00:29:35,191
You have a family. I get that.
I don't wanna break that up.

347
00:29:43,033 --> 00:29:44,034
Well....

348
00:29:46,536 --> 00:29:49,497
Here is $13,000.

349
00:29:50,331 --> 00:29:52,834
- Considering I've only known you...
- I am not a whore.

350
00:29:53,084 --> 00:29:54,919
- I didn't say that.
- You didn't have to.

351
00:29:55,086 --> 00:29:56,796
No, Dusty, I...

352
00:29:57,130 --> 00:30:00,175
Please, just take it. It's all I've got.
I don't have any more.

353
00:30:00,342 --> 00:30:02,052
I don't have insurance, Don!

354
00:30:03,011 --> 00:30:05,972
My appointment just for yesterday
was 900 dollars!

355
00:30:06,806 --> 00:30:10,185
Oh, my God.
That's an expensive specialist.

356
00:30:11,102 --> 00:30:13,688
Are you sure
that you wanna go through with this?

357
00:30:13,855 --> 00:30:16,441
- Don't ask me that again.
- You can still keep the money.

358
00:30:19,778 --> 00:30:21,279
What would your wife think, Don?

359
00:30:21,446 --> 00:30:23,656
Don't say that. Please don't say that.

360
00:30:27,118 --> 00:30:28,578
I don't know what else to do.

361
00:30:32,582 --> 00:30:35,669
You should have thought of that
before you pumped me full of semen!

362
00:31:02,362 --> 00:31:05,615
<i>This is Dusty. Leave a message
at the beep and I'll get back to you.</i>

363
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:09,744
Dusty? Hi. It's Don.

364
00:31:11,287 --> 00:31:13,164
I'm sorry that I offended you.

365
00:31:13,832 --> 00:31:16,960
Do you think that Les and Abby
have forged A.J.'s birth certificate?

366
00:31:17,127 --> 00:31:18,169
His birth certificate?

367
00:31:18,336 --> 00:31:22,632
A.J.! You don't need to play
quite so rough, okay?

368
00:31:22,799 --> 00:31:24,009
Mona, Mona, Mona.

369
00:31:24,217 --> 00:31:28,805
It's demeaning, that's all.
What if it stunts his emotional growth?

370
00:31:30,140 --> 00:31:31,641
You're just being paranoid.

371
00:31:32,809 --> 00:31:35,645
Well, paranoia is just total awareness.

372
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:45,613
Don, have you ever considered
that maybe she's making this up?

373
00:31:47,449 --> 00:31:50,493
Well, either way I've gotta pay her.
There's no way around that.

374
00:31:52,162 --> 00:31:54,205
- That's not true.
- She'll tell Mona.

375
00:31:54,372 --> 00:31:57,167
I have to pay her.
That is the blackmail. That is...

376
00:31:58,251 --> 00:31:59,669
That is my dilemma.

377
00:32:04,424 --> 00:32:06,509
Then you have to tell Mona first.

378
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:08,803
That's a terrible idea.

379
00:32:09,012 --> 00:32:13,641
Listen, Donny, say you pay her, all right?
And Dusty wants more.

380
00:32:14,476 --> 00:32:16,353
So she shows up at your house
and rings your doorbell...

381
00:32:16,561 --> 00:32:20,607
...and in front of your whole family
tells Mona you guys have been screwing.

382
00:32:22,067 --> 00:32:25,779
Or this: What if the kid is real...

383
00:32:25,945 --> 00:32:29,366
...and it shows up 10 years from now
and exclaims:

384
00:32:29,532 --> 00:32:30,617
"You're my daddy!

385
00:32:30,784 --> 00:32:33,203
You used to throttle my mommy.
Give me money."

386
00:32:33,453 --> 00:32:34,496
Throttle?

387
00:32:36,623 --> 00:32:37,665
I don't know, Don.

388
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:39,918
You should own up...

389
00:32:40,085 --> 00:32:42,245
...or be bitch-slapped by a slut
in front of your kids.

390
00:33:16,204 --> 00:33:17,414
Are you happy?

391
00:33:17,997 --> 00:33:19,249
Very happy. You?

392
00:33:19,416 --> 00:33:21,835
Yeah. Totally. Do you love me?

393
00:33:22,168 --> 00:33:23,420
Of course.

394
00:33:23,670 --> 00:33:24,754
I love you too.

395
00:33:27,298 --> 00:33:29,634
- What's wrong?
- I really messed up.

396
00:33:30,135 --> 00:33:34,597
- What did you do?
- Well, I... I need you to forgive me.

397
00:33:35,849 --> 00:33:36,891
If you can.

398
00:33:37,058 --> 00:33:39,602
What did you do?

399
00:33:44,232 --> 00:33:45,400
Is this about money?

400
00:33:45,608 --> 00:33:46,985
No! Well....

401
00:33:48,111 --> 00:33:49,154
Then what is it?

402
00:33:49,446 --> 00:33:54,159
Well, it's not easy to... It's the
kind of thing that is difficult to...

403
00:33:54,367 --> 00:33:56,995
- Tell me.
- Well, I feel like I...

404
00:33:57,162 --> 00:33:58,204
Spit it out, Don!

405
00:33:58,371 --> 00:34:01,458
I've been having an affair
at the store with Dusty, the salesgirl!

406
00:34:03,501 --> 00:34:04,711
And she's pregnant.

407
00:34:14,179 --> 00:34:15,221
I'm sorry.

408
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:18,224
I'm so sorry.

409
00:34:20,685 --> 00:34:22,937
I am really, really sorry.

410
00:34:23,146 --> 00:34:25,482
Now, Mona, can we talk...?

411
00:34:28,651 --> 00:34:29,652
Hello?

412
00:34:40,330 --> 00:34:44,167
Mona. I shouldn't have...
Can we talk about this?

413
00:34:44,334 --> 00:34:47,712
I mean,
I think we need to be constructive...

414
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:51,508
...and I know
what I've done is really stupid...

415
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:55,762
...and I know it hurts you a lot.
I can see that. I can see...

416
00:34:55,929 --> 00:34:57,555
I love you so much.

417
00:34:57,764 --> 00:34:59,891
- Is she aborting it?
- What?

418
00:35:00,100 --> 00:35:01,726
Is she aborting it?

419
00:35:06,523 --> 00:35:07,524
No.

420
00:35:09,442 --> 00:35:11,194
Who else did you tell about this?

421
00:35:12,195 --> 00:35:13,279
Nobody.

422
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:15,990
Don't lie to me.

423
00:35:16,157 --> 00:35:17,742
I'm not. I swear to you, I'm not.

424
00:35:19,661 --> 00:35:22,288
No one else knows,
and she won't abort it. Are you sure?

425
00:35:22,497 --> 00:35:24,040
Yes, I am very sure.

426
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:36,886
Do you want a divorce?

427
00:35:40,265 --> 00:35:41,307
No.

428
00:35:42,809 --> 00:35:43,852
Never.

429
00:35:44,561 --> 00:35:45,562
I....

430
00:35:46,813 --> 00:35:50,275
I love you so much.

431
00:35:50,817 --> 00:35:55,405
And I love our beautiful kids.
And our life.

432
00:35:56,740 --> 00:35:57,741
Our goals?

433
00:35:58,033 --> 00:35:59,075
Yes.

434
00:36:00,618 --> 00:36:02,620
And you're committed
to achieving our goals?

435
00:36:02,829 --> 00:36:04,164
Yes, I am.

436
00:36:10,170 --> 00:36:12,047
I assume this is about money.

437
00:36:12,672 --> 00:36:16,217
It's what all those greedy,
anti-nuclear-family types want.

438
00:36:25,310 --> 00:36:27,187
Guess there's only one thing to do.

439
00:36:27,395 --> 00:36:30,357
I will do whatever you want, honey...

440
00:36:30,565 --> 00:36:34,110
...because I am so sorry,
and I love you so much.

441
00:36:35,195 --> 00:36:38,990
I can do anything that you need me to
to keep this...

442
00:36:39,157 --> 00:36:41,534
...marriage and set of goals alive.

443
00:36:42,786 --> 00:36:44,287
You have to kill her.

444
00:36:53,213 --> 00:36:54,798
You're joking, right?

445
00:36:57,008 --> 00:37:00,553
Does it look like I'm fucking joking?

446
00:37:01,805 --> 00:37:02,889
No.

447
00:37:04,808 --> 00:37:05,809
Good.

448
00:37:06,518 --> 00:37:09,688
- We can't just kill someone.
- We won't. You will.

449
00:37:10,730 --> 00:37:12,482
I can't...

450
00:37:14,317 --> 00:37:18,697
You have to. I will not have my husband
father a bastard!

451
00:37:18,905 --> 00:37:23,284
I will not put my children through that!
I will not put myself through that.

452
00:37:24,119 --> 00:37:27,997
What would our friends think?
What would the community think?

453
00:37:28,873 --> 00:37:31,251
We'd be the laughingstock
of this entire city.

454
00:37:34,462 --> 00:37:39,009
I can't just shoot someone like an animal.

455
00:37:39,718 --> 00:37:40,760
I can't.

456
00:37:42,554 --> 00:37:45,348
I can't. I can't, I'm sorry.

457
00:37:46,141 --> 00:37:48,643
I should've taken it,
but the more I think about it...

458
00:37:48,810 --> 00:37:50,353
...I don't think he has more.

459
00:37:52,188 --> 00:37:56,484
Oh, he does.
Beautiful house, beautiful wife...

460
00:37:56,651 --> 00:37:59,529
...nice car, private school.
He's got a lot more.

461
00:37:59,821 --> 00:38:01,031
I believe him.

462
00:38:01,865 --> 00:38:04,617
You believe him? Well, that's hilarious.

463
00:38:05,618 --> 00:38:08,788
I feel like you guys got
some sort of special bond or something.

464
00:38:08,955 --> 00:38:12,542
- You know, I used to have a special bond.
- I think it's his wife's money.

465
00:38:14,544 --> 00:38:15,545
You think?

466
00:38:18,131 --> 00:38:19,632
- Oh, babe.
- I didn't mean...

467
00:38:19,799 --> 00:38:21,718
Listen, don't think ever.

468
00:38:22,135 --> 00:38:26,723
Thinking had you sucking cops off
for crack, right?

469
00:38:28,016 --> 00:38:29,893
He fucked you in every orifice...

470
00:38:30,060 --> 00:38:33,646
...and I want more than 13 grand for that.
You understand me?

471
00:38:33,855 --> 00:38:35,148
- Baby...
- What?

472
00:38:35,357 --> 00:38:38,068
...you're really hurting me.

473
00:38:39,486 --> 00:38:42,739
I just feel like we're disconnected.

474
00:38:43,239 --> 00:38:47,077
Okay? I feel like you're not as focused
as you should be.

475
00:38:47,410 --> 00:38:50,205
- I know what I'm doing.
- You said that last time, right?

476
00:38:50,413 --> 00:38:54,042
And Uncle Murphy had to come along
and save your sweet life, didn't I?

477
00:38:54,834 --> 00:38:57,253
Not this time, darling.
Not with that pretty boy.

478
00:38:57,462 --> 00:38:59,964
Not with all the money
that I've had to put into....

479
00:39:00,256 --> 00:39:04,344
Into your fancy clothes and your
make-up, so you could fit into this...

480
00:39:04,511 --> 00:39:06,179
... "Champagne Society."

481
00:39:09,015 --> 00:39:12,936
Hey. You don't take care of him....

482
00:39:14,187 --> 00:39:16,856
I will. You get me?

483
00:39:18,733 --> 00:39:20,402
I understand.

484
00:39:23,154 --> 00:39:26,032
Hey! You get me?

485
00:39:26,199 --> 00:39:27,450
I get you.

486
00:39:27,742 --> 00:39:29,202
Do you fucking get me!

487
00:39:32,330 --> 00:39:34,457
<i>I don't want to hear "can't," Don!</i>

488
00:39:34,624 --> 00:39:37,168
"Can't" is not gonna work!
That's not gonna work!

489
00:39:37,377 --> 00:39:38,503
This is your fault!

490
00:39:38,670 --> 00:39:42,215
Now, get it done
and do what it takes to make it right!

491
00:39:42,424 --> 00:39:46,219
After everything I've done!
Everything my parents have done!

492
00:39:46,428 --> 00:39:49,931
All the money!
All the opportunities we've given you!

493
00:39:50,181 --> 00:39:52,392
You would be nowhere!
Nowhere without me!

494
00:39:52,600 --> 00:39:55,061
Nowhere without this family!

495
00:39:55,270 --> 00:39:59,149
Do something, Don!
Be a man for once in your life!

496
00:39:59,357 --> 00:40:04,029
And just take responsibility
for the things that you destroy!

497
00:40:04,487 --> 00:40:06,448
What am I gonna tell my parents
about this?

498
00:40:06,614 --> 00:40:08,408
What am I gonna tell my parents?

499
00:40:19,669 --> 00:40:20,712
What do I do?

500
00:40:20,879 --> 00:40:23,089
Just put it on speakerphone,
for God's sakes!

501
00:40:30,263 --> 00:40:31,931
- Hello?
<i>- Hey.</i>

502
00:40:34,017 --> 00:40:35,018
Dusty...?

503
00:40:36,019 --> 00:40:37,270
I need that money.

504
00:40:37,854 --> 00:40:40,065
<i>But it has to be
more than 13,000.</i>

505
00:40:43,318 --> 00:40:44,903
Okay. How much?

506
00:40:45,278 --> 00:40:46,363
<i>Twenty-five.</i>

507
00:40:48,907 --> 00:40:52,160
- Twenty-five!
- Get 25, or my next call is to Mona.

508
00:40:53,953 --> 00:40:55,080
<i>Do you hear me?</i>

509
00:40:55,413 --> 00:40:57,290
Yes. I....

510
00:40:59,542 --> 00:41:01,378
Twenty-five is fine.

511
00:41:02,462 --> 00:41:03,880
<i>I just want to make it right.</i>

512
00:41:05,882 --> 00:41:09,135
Okay, tomorrow night,
the furniture store, eight o'clock.

513
00:41:13,139 --> 00:41:17,435
You were gonna let that whore
extort money from us?

514
00:41:18,561 --> 00:41:22,607
I deserve better than this, Don.

515
00:41:23,233 --> 00:41:26,027
- Your children deserve better than this.
- I know.

516
00:41:26,236 --> 00:41:27,987
And what are you gonna do about it?

517
00:41:39,541 --> 00:41:41,251
What are you gonna do about it?

518
00:42:18,997 --> 00:42:21,958
That should be enough
to fell a small village.

519
00:42:25,003 --> 00:42:26,171
Why so much?

520
00:42:27,130 --> 00:42:28,882
Well, you never know about dosage.

521
00:42:30,175 --> 00:42:31,301
Sometimes the weather...

522
00:42:31,468 --> 00:42:33,845
...can make the body
absorb the drug differently.

523
00:42:35,972 --> 00:42:37,932
I saw it on an episode of <i>First 48.</i>

524
00:42:39,517 --> 00:42:43,104
You're so calm.
Why is this so easy for you?

525
00:42:43,855 --> 00:42:45,982
Do not get weak, Don!

526
00:42:46,149 --> 00:42:48,276
This tramp
is trying to tear apart our family.

527
00:42:48,443 --> 00:42:51,123
- How dare you not try to fight for that.
- That's not what I meant.

528
00:42:51,154 --> 00:42:52,906
This is about our legacy.

529
00:42:53,156 --> 00:42:55,909
Are you sure there's no other way?

530
00:42:58,870 --> 00:43:01,456
There is only ever my way.

531
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:06,044
Now,
I need to pick up the children...

532
00:43:06,211 --> 00:43:08,838
...and drop them at the Buckleys'
for their sleepover.

533
00:43:10,465 --> 00:43:11,508
Love you.

534
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:49,045
Come on in and have a seat.

535
00:43:49,587 --> 00:43:52,882
- I'm not here to talk.
- Just go ahead. Sit down.

536
00:43:53,091 --> 00:43:56,219
- Don't make this any more difficult...
- Just right here, please, sit!

537
00:43:56,386 --> 00:44:00,015
Okay? I've got a lot of the anxiety.
I came through for you. I got your money.

538
00:44:00,181 --> 00:44:02,017
Just give me a few minutes. That's all.

539
00:44:04,102 --> 00:44:05,395
You don't look so good.

540
00:44:06,062 --> 00:44:08,314
I'm being blackmailed.
How am I supposed to look?

541
00:44:08,481 --> 00:44:12,235
- I didn't want it to come to this.
- I know. I hear you.

542
00:44:12,402 --> 00:44:15,196
- Oh, God, I'm just so sick of all this...
- The money, Don.

543
00:44:18,366 --> 00:44:19,492
Okay.

544
00:44:20,952 --> 00:44:23,079
Pretty soon you'll forget I even existed.

545
00:44:23,663 --> 00:44:25,498
I don't think so.

546
00:44:28,209 --> 00:44:29,336
You know....

547
00:44:33,631 --> 00:44:37,927
I'll never forget what we had,
and the way that you made me feel.

548
00:44:38,803 --> 00:44:40,347
Then why would you act like that?

549
00:44:40,513 --> 00:44:42,182
Why would you treat me like trash...

550
00:44:42,349 --> 00:44:44,684
...like something
you just throw out on the street?

551
00:44:44,851 --> 00:44:47,103
Because I'm a fucking coward!

552
00:44:48,438 --> 00:44:50,190
Well, that's typical, I guess.

553
00:44:50,398 --> 00:44:53,443
Come on, Don. Just give me the money...

554
00:44:53,610 --> 00:44:56,279
...so I can get out of here
and forget this ever happened.

555
00:45:03,953 --> 00:45:07,165
- Let's at least have a proper send-off.
- I'm not having sex with you.

556
00:45:07,499 --> 00:45:10,293
That's not what I meant.

557
00:45:14,005 --> 00:45:15,048
A toast.

558
00:45:17,509 --> 00:45:20,011
That's what you want, one last toast?

559
00:45:21,596 --> 00:45:23,139
What could we possibly drink to?

560
00:45:24,641 --> 00:45:26,685
I don't know.

561
00:45:31,106 --> 00:45:32,148
To....

562
00:45:32,982 --> 00:45:37,987
To wives and sweethearts.
May they never meet.

563
00:45:38,238 --> 00:45:39,406
That's appropriate.

564
00:45:42,325 --> 00:45:46,705
What did you see in me?
I'm a married furniture salesman.

565
00:45:48,748 --> 00:45:50,667
I really liked you, Don Champagne.

566
00:45:52,043 --> 00:45:54,504
And I hope you find
all the happiness in the world.

567
00:46:06,766 --> 00:46:07,976
Don't worry.

568
00:46:09,060 --> 00:46:12,397
Good things happen to good people,
and you are a good person.

569
00:46:13,940 --> 00:46:15,233
You'll be all right.

570
00:46:16,860 --> 00:46:19,279
Now, come on. I need the money.

571
00:46:20,280 --> 00:46:21,531
I'm so sorry.

572
00:46:22,073 --> 00:46:24,075
About what? Which part, Don?

573
00:46:24,659 --> 00:46:25,827
About all this.

574
00:46:26,286 --> 00:46:27,370
All what?

575
00:46:29,706 --> 00:46:32,584
I don't know how long this is taking.

576
00:46:33,209 --> 00:46:36,171
Why are you being so weird, Don?
What is wrong with you?

577
00:46:36,588 --> 00:46:37,672
I don't have it!

578
00:46:38,256 --> 00:46:39,424
You don't have the money?

579
00:46:39,591 --> 00:46:42,844
No, I honestly do not have the money.
I thought I did, and I don't.

580
00:46:43,011 --> 00:46:45,131
I didn't even bring it.
I don't have any of the money.

581
00:46:46,139 --> 00:46:50,352
Do you at least have the 13,000?
Please?

582
00:46:55,273 --> 00:46:56,649
Do you hear that?

583
00:46:57,359 --> 00:47:01,029
- Hear what?
- The ringing sound....

584
00:47:08,411 --> 00:47:09,913
No....

585
00:47:12,332 --> 00:47:13,833
You put something in my drink.

586
00:47:14,125 --> 00:47:15,418
Put it in your drink?

587
00:47:15,585 --> 00:47:19,589
Oh, fuck. I can barely see.

588
00:47:20,256 --> 00:47:22,008
What did you do, Donny?

589
00:47:22,217 --> 00:47:23,718
Nothing. I swear.

590
00:47:25,053 --> 00:47:26,096
You drugged me.

591
00:47:26,304 --> 00:47:27,389
Yeah, I did.

592
00:47:27,597 --> 00:47:28,598
You drugged me!

593
00:47:28,765 --> 00:47:31,768
I did. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I....

594
00:47:44,114 --> 00:47:46,700
Give me the key, you fucking prick!

595
00:47:47,033 --> 00:47:51,454
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

596
00:47:51,621 --> 00:47:52,831
Oh, no!

597
00:47:54,708 --> 00:47:58,712
No, Dusty. Mona made me do it!

598
00:47:59,421 --> 00:48:02,257
Fuck Mona! Fuck you!

599
00:48:03,258 --> 00:48:06,678
No, no! Oh, God! Oh, no.

600
00:48:09,597 --> 00:48:12,308
I'm trying to get away from some....

601
00:48:12,517 --> 00:48:14,394
- Wait, what? Get away?
- People....

602
00:48:14,561 --> 00:48:16,896
What people? What people?

603
00:48:18,648 --> 00:48:20,025
What about the baby...?

604
00:48:20,233 --> 00:48:21,568
What? What?

605
00:48:24,738 --> 00:48:27,198
More than the moon and the stars....

606
00:48:34,622 --> 00:48:36,750
Mona made you do it?

607
00:48:39,461 --> 00:48:40,628
Get her in the trunk.

608
00:49:04,944 --> 00:49:06,613
I don't feel so good.

609
00:49:15,080 --> 00:49:16,706
So, what do I do first?

610
00:49:16,915 --> 00:49:19,793
No! She's alive! No!

611
00:49:23,838 --> 00:49:25,840
Why isn't she dead?

612
00:49:26,299 --> 00:49:27,550
Oh, boy.

613
00:49:28,301 --> 00:49:29,469
What do we do?

614
00:49:29,844 --> 00:49:31,680
Maybe we should just let her go.

615
00:49:32,722 --> 00:49:34,265
- Really?
- No.

616
00:49:34,432 --> 00:49:36,393
- No. Get a hammer.
- A hammer?

617
00:49:36,559 --> 00:49:38,520
Yes. Get a hammer
so you can hit her in the head with it.

618
00:49:38,687 --> 00:49:41,398
No! No! Why aren't you dead?

619
00:49:41,815 --> 00:49:44,693
I thought there was enough
to fell a small village!

620
00:49:44,859 --> 00:49:46,361
I guess not. Now get a hammer!

621
00:49:47,862 --> 00:49:51,825
No. A hammer?

622
00:49:54,619 --> 00:49:56,037
It's a hammer.

623
00:49:56,413 --> 00:49:58,665
Oh, no, honey.
You have to do it, of course.

624
00:49:58,832 --> 00:50:02,043
- What? I can't.
- Must I remind you who's at fault here?

625
00:50:02,252 --> 00:50:04,754
Mona, I've already
attempted to murder someone for you!

626
00:50:04,921 --> 00:50:07,424
No, honey. For us. For us.
And you failed.

627
00:50:07,590 --> 00:50:10,260
So now you have to do it again,
and do it right this time.

628
00:50:11,302 --> 00:50:12,345
Unless, of course...

629
00:50:12,512 --> 00:50:15,306
...you're not truly committed
to what we have, and then....

630
00:50:20,478 --> 00:50:21,688
What if I choke her?

631
00:50:23,481 --> 00:50:24,566
Or drown her?

632
00:50:25,650 --> 00:50:27,027
Give it to me. I'll do it.

633
00:50:27,193 --> 00:50:29,779
- I'll bury her.
- No, no. I'll do it. Open the trunk.

634
00:50:32,615 --> 00:50:33,908
Open the trunk!

635
00:50:39,372 --> 00:50:40,707
Oh, my...!

636
00:50:42,667 --> 00:50:43,793
Okay.

637
00:50:59,726 --> 00:51:01,019
I'm gonna kill her, man.

638
00:51:01,811 --> 00:51:03,688
Relax. Her phone probably just died.

639
00:51:04,064 --> 00:51:05,482
Oh, no.

640
00:51:06,566 --> 00:51:10,320
No, that's not like her.
No. Something's wrong.

641
00:51:10,737 --> 00:51:13,031
What are you gonna do?
Find her and then kill her?

642
00:51:13,198 --> 00:51:14,491
That makes a lot of sense.

643
00:51:21,664 --> 00:51:25,168
Yeah, oh, fuck me....

644
00:51:27,087 --> 00:51:29,089
I think it's all these drugs, man. Fuck.

645
00:51:30,048 --> 00:51:34,678
I think that's making me fucking paranoid.

646
00:51:35,136 --> 00:51:38,598
Listen, remember, I'm the paranoid one.
Can't both be on edge...

647
00:51:38,848 --> 00:51:41,267
...so just drink your beer and chill out.
Okay?

648
00:51:45,188 --> 00:51:49,734
I can feel it in my bones, man.
Something ain't right.

649
00:51:50,360 --> 00:51:54,197
She always comes back, Murphy.

650
00:51:55,281 --> 00:51:56,908
No, it's the furniture store man.

651
00:51:58,743 --> 00:52:02,372
That fucking white-bread piece of shit,
that furniture store man.

652
00:53:48,144 --> 00:53:51,690
You're gonna need to pick up some more
trash bags from Costco tomorrow.

653
00:53:51,981 --> 00:53:56,820
I'd write it down for you,
but I'm just covered in that girl.

654
00:53:57,987 --> 00:54:00,031
Just distasteful.

655
00:54:01,658 --> 00:54:04,035
FYI, I'm hiring the next employee.

656
00:54:04,994 --> 00:54:06,162
Now, grab a shovel.

657
00:54:06,329 --> 00:54:08,623
We need to fertilize the garden
with your hooker.

658
00:54:09,666 --> 00:54:11,751
Who wasn't pregnant, by the way.

659
00:54:37,485 --> 00:54:39,696
No! Wait, wait!

660
00:54:44,367 --> 00:54:46,703
Don't hurt me. Please don't hurt me.

661
00:55:08,224 --> 00:55:09,559
- Thank you very much.
- You're welcome, sir.

662
00:55:09,726 --> 00:55:10,769
What the hell happened?

663
00:55:11,394 --> 00:55:13,146
I got jumped.

664
00:55:13,563 --> 00:55:14,606
Inside the store?

665
00:55:14,814 --> 00:55:17,400
You know, it just came out of the blue,
out of nowhere.

666
00:55:17,567 --> 00:55:19,235
I'm so sorry, boss.

667
00:55:19,402 --> 00:55:20,653
Are you hurt bad?

668
00:55:20,904 --> 00:55:25,075
I got a little scrape here,
and a busted up knee.

669
00:55:25,283 --> 00:55:27,744
- Holy shit, Les!
- Don Champagne.

670
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:32,415
Oh. Hey, chief. Yeah, hi.

671
00:55:32,624 --> 00:55:34,626
What's the matter?
You hurt your hand there?

672
00:55:35,669 --> 00:55:38,838
Yeah. Little stockroom accident.

673
00:55:39,464 --> 00:55:40,507
Yeah.

674
00:55:41,758 --> 00:55:44,969
Well, your office is a
bit of a mess, but...

675
00:55:45,136 --> 00:55:48,973
...it would appear the only items missing
are his watch and wallet.

676
00:55:49,683 --> 00:55:51,851
I'd do a thorough check of the premises,
though.

677
00:55:52,018 --> 00:55:54,479
If you find anything else missing,
give us a call.

678
00:55:54,646 --> 00:55:56,856
Yep. Will do.
Thank you so much for coming down.

679
00:55:57,023 --> 00:55:59,442
I appreciate it, you know,
for something so trivial.

680
00:55:59,901 --> 00:56:04,030
Actually, Don, I came down here
about something else entirely.

681
00:56:04,447 --> 00:56:06,700
You did? Okay, tell me, chief.
What have you got?

682
00:56:06,866 --> 00:56:08,284
What do you know?
What do you need from me?

683
00:56:08,451 --> 00:56:10,704
You got a girl named Dusty
still working here?

684
00:56:11,871 --> 00:56:13,456
Yes. Yep.

685
00:56:14,332 --> 00:56:16,835
- When's the last time you seen her?
- I....

686
00:56:17,669 --> 00:56:19,295
- Last week.
- I think last week.

687
00:56:19,462 --> 00:56:20,630
Yeah. Last week.

688
00:56:21,798 --> 00:56:23,633
- Last week?
- Definitely last week.

689
00:56:23,842 --> 00:56:25,010
Yeah.

690
00:56:25,218 --> 00:56:28,596
- What kind of car does she drive?
- Itâ€™s like, a big blue...

691
00:56:28,805 --> 00:56:31,057
- A blue Suburban.
- That's it. Suburban.

692
00:56:31,307 --> 00:56:33,184
Yeah, it's a piece of shit like mine.

693
00:56:33,351 --> 00:56:35,812
- Yours isn't.
- It's a little old.

694
00:56:36,021 --> 00:56:37,063
Well, we found it.

695
00:56:37,272 --> 00:56:38,523
You did?

696
00:56:38,732 --> 00:56:40,150
Somebody set it on fire.

697
00:56:40,358 --> 00:56:42,198
- Someone set her car on fire?
- Was she in it?

698
00:56:42,318 --> 00:56:44,195
No, sir. Thank goodness.

699
00:56:44,654 --> 00:56:47,407
- Thank goodness.
- Not much left, but....

700
00:56:47,824 --> 00:56:50,952
This photo managed to survive
of her and your man there.

701
00:56:51,202 --> 00:56:55,081
The vehicle, however,
is burnt up just like I like my bacon.

702
00:56:56,541 --> 00:56:57,917
Nice and crispy.

703
00:57:00,545 --> 00:57:02,213
You know,
that car she was driving...

704
00:57:02,380 --> 00:57:06,176
...is registered to another fella went
missing a while back outside of town.

705
00:57:06,843 --> 00:57:08,261
We're still looking into that.

706
00:57:08,845 --> 00:57:11,014
- That's so odd!
- That's odd, huh?

707
00:57:11,222 --> 00:57:12,265
It is.

708
00:57:13,016 --> 00:57:16,519
Wait, you don't think this has
anything to do with that, do you?

709
00:57:16,686 --> 00:57:19,564
Oh, no, no, no.
You'll see, it's probably the work...

710
00:57:19,773 --> 00:57:23,109
...of a couple winos
looking for booze and quick cash.

711
00:57:24,361 --> 00:57:26,738
But when you've been doing this
as long as I have...

712
00:57:26,905 --> 00:57:29,240
...well, you know, anything's possible.

713
00:57:32,202 --> 00:57:35,288
- All right, then.
- We'll let you know if she comes back.

714
00:57:37,207 --> 00:57:38,750
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

715
00:57:45,548 --> 00:57:46,591
- Hey.
- Yeah?

716
00:57:48,218 --> 00:57:50,053
What really happened to your hand?

717
00:57:50,887 --> 00:57:52,055
You know....

718
00:57:53,556 --> 00:57:56,643
I took your advice and I told Mona.

719
00:57:57,727 --> 00:58:02,482
- And your hand was the only casualty?
- Well, she slammed it in a panini press.

720
00:58:02,691 --> 00:58:05,318
- While you were making a panini?
- No, Les.

721
00:58:07,654 --> 00:58:09,739
Well, what did Mona do?
Did she kick you out?

722
00:58:10,949 --> 00:58:12,242
No.

723
00:58:13,827 --> 00:58:16,746
We have goals, we have a family...

724
00:58:16,955 --> 00:58:20,291
...and we're not gonna let
a little infidelity get in the way of that.

725
00:58:20,750 --> 00:58:21,960
It's gonna take a little time to heal...

726
00:58:22,168 --> 00:58:24,796
...but ultimately we'll be better partners
because of it.

727
00:58:26,006 --> 00:58:27,966
- Mona said that?
- Absolutely. Every word.

728
00:58:28,425 --> 00:58:32,429
Oh, my God.
She is an incredible specimen.

729
00:58:32,929 --> 00:58:34,931
Yeah. She definitely is.

730
00:58:36,599 --> 00:58:40,520
- Hey, what the hell happened to Dusty?
- I don't know. But I'm worried.

731
00:58:42,272 --> 00:58:44,482
- What if she's dead?
- No, don't say that.

732
00:58:44,649 --> 00:58:45,734
No, what if she's dead?

733
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:49,195
Les. don't you say that.
Don't you dare say that, Les.

734
00:58:50,530 --> 00:58:52,365
Poor Dusty.

735
00:58:52,949 --> 00:58:55,952
All she wanted
was to get back up on her feet...

736
00:58:56,202 --> 00:58:57,954
...and support her family.

737
00:58:58,121 --> 00:58:59,998
She's so skinny and pretty.

738
00:59:00,874 --> 00:59:03,835
Oh, poor girl. Poor Dusty.

739
00:59:05,962 --> 00:59:07,213
Have you been drinking?

740
00:59:07,797 --> 00:59:08,840
A little.

741
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:10,717
It's 10 in the morning, Les.

742
00:59:11,301 --> 00:59:12,635
I'm not proud of it.

743
00:59:13,303 --> 00:59:15,638
I told you
we should've dumped the car in the lake.

744
00:59:15,805 --> 00:59:17,682
<i>- That doesn't work.</i>
- What do you mean, it doesn't work?

745
00:59:17,849 --> 00:59:19,649
It would be
at the bottom of a lake right now.

746
00:59:19,809 --> 00:59:22,687
<i>You need to erase all evidence,
burning it is the best option.</i>

747
00:59:22,854 --> 00:59:24,064
<i>I saw it on</i> First 48.

748
00:59:24,272 --> 00:59:25,982
Will you shut up about <i>First 48!</i>

749
00:59:26,316 --> 00:59:28,860
<i>No reason to get short with me,
Don Champagne....</i>

750
00:59:29,069 --> 00:59:30,570
Chief, hi. I'll call you back.

751
00:59:30,945 --> 00:59:32,655
- Everything all right, Don?
- Oh, yeah.

752
00:59:35,408 --> 00:59:37,994
Mona wants to record <i>First 48</i>
instead of <i>Duck Dynasty.</i>

753
00:59:38,328 --> 00:59:41,247
And I won't stand for it anymore,
so I had to...

754
00:59:46,336 --> 00:59:48,421
New number. New card.

755
00:59:50,340 --> 00:59:52,509
See, it's raised a little. Isn't that nice?

756
00:59:52,676 --> 00:59:53,718
Oh, that is gorgeous.

757
00:59:53,927 --> 00:59:57,681
I was gonna get my picture made on it,
but he wanted an extra six dollars, so....

758
00:59:57,847 --> 00:59:58,890
Thank you.

759
00:59:59,516 --> 01:00:00,558
All right then.

760
01:00:30,547 --> 01:00:31,715
Andrew!

761
01:00:37,220 --> 01:00:39,139
- Andrew?
- What?

762
01:00:40,223 --> 01:00:42,559
Oh, son. Are you okay?

763
01:00:43,059 --> 01:00:44,227
I'm fine.

764
01:00:45,061 --> 01:00:46,104
What did that man say?

765
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,898
He said to give you this.

766
01:01:13,757 --> 01:01:15,091
Okay.

767
01:01:17,469 --> 01:01:20,055
<i>She did say she was trying
to get away from some people.</i>

768
01:01:20,221 --> 01:01:21,598
When did she say that?

769
01:01:22,265 --> 01:01:27,103
Last night. Before she... We....

770
01:01:28,813 --> 01:01:31,066
- What else did she say?
- Nothing.

771
01:01:31,775 --> 01:01:34,861
It just seems like those two things
are connected, don't you think?

772
01:01:35,028 --> 01:01:36,071
It would seem so.

773
01:01:36,404 --> 01:01:39,032
They nearly crippled Les.
Now they're threatening us.

774
01:01:40,116 --> 01:01:41,576
Les is fine.

775
01:01:42,744 --> 01:01:44,537
I'm just a furniture salesman.

776
01:01:45,622 --> 01:01:48,958
You are so much more
than just a furniture salesman, Don.

777
01:01:52,545 --> 01:01:53,672
You are my husband.

778
01:01:55,131 --> 01:01:57,217
You are the father of my children.

779
01:02:00,303 --> 01:02:02,347
Mona, come on.

780
01:02:02,681 --> 01:02:05,141
You need to pull yourself together.

781
01:02:05,517 --> 01:02:06,893
I don't know how to fix this.

782
01:02:10,355 --> 01:02:11,815
I know where Dusty lived.

783
01:02:12,816 --> 01:02:14,484
- How?
- I followed her.

784
01:02:15,819 --> 01:02:16,861
Right.

785
01:02:17,153 --> 01:02:19,823
So these guys probably live there too.

786
01:02:22,492 --> 01:02:24,661
We can't kill anyone else.

787
01:03:05,035 --> 01:03:07,203
Hey, there is a private room.

788
01:03:25,221 --> 01:03:27,057
- You must be Hot Carl.
- What?

789
01:03:27,807 --> 01:03:28,975
You like big titties?

790
01:03:31,102 --> 01:03:32,395
You know, yeah.

791
01:03:35,315 --> 01:03:36,733
- Right?
- This way, buddy.

792
01:03:45,992 --> 01:03:48,119
Well, well, well.

793
01:03:58,797 --> 01:04:00,298
I'm Don Champagne.

794
01:04:02,592 --> 01:04:05,387
Why don't you shake the hand
that's gonna shock the world.

795
01:04:06,262 --> 01:04:08,139
What happened to your hand?

796
01:04:08,348 --> 01:04:12,936
I actually... I dropped a couch on it.

797
01:04:15,188 --> 01:04:16,231
Was it heavy?

798
01:04:16,439 --> 01:04:18,316
It was heavy. Yeah.

799
01:04:18,525 --> 01:04:21,945
So, Don, I'm sure that little slut
told you all about us, didn't she?

800
01:04:23,113 --> 01:04:24,114
She told me enough.

801
01:04:24,280 --> 01:04:28,034
- Did she tell you how big my dick was?
- We did not get into specifics about that.

802
01:04:28,284 --> 01:04:29,285
It's big.

803
01:04:29,577 --> 01:04:31,955
- Is that right?
- Yeah. It is big.

804
01:04:34,374 --> 01:04:35,667
The pussy or the dick?

805
01:04:38,962 --> 01:04:40,422
Does that bitch have my money?

806
01:04:41,131 --> 01:04:42,257
Yes.

807
01:04:44,634 --> 01:04:47,595
- Can I trust the furniture man?
- Oh, yeah.

808
01:04:47,804 --> 01:04:48,930
Yeah?

809
01:04:49,806 --> 01:04:53,184
Don, did you happen
to bring any police with you?

810
01:04:54,060 --> 01:04:55,770
- No way.
- No way?

811
01:04:55,937 --> 01:04:59,524
No way. I wanna take care of this today.
I wanna end this.

812
01:04:59,733 --> 01:05:01,317
You're a smart guy, Don.

813
01:05:01,901 --> 01:05:03,361
I've got a lot of faith in you.

814
01:05:05,822 --> 01:05:08,366
Here you go. This one's on the house.

815
01:05:11,828 --> 01:05:12,871
Those are drugs.

816
01:05:13,038 --> 01:05:14,164
No shit, Don. It's meth.

817
01:05:14,372 --> 01:05:16,166
That is gonna get you high.

818
01:05:16,833 --> 01:05:20,086
Now, Don, you're gonna do this,
and then I'll trust you. You don't....

819
01:05:25,550 --> 01:05:28,678
I have a genetic mitral valve prolapse.
I can't even drink coffee.

820
01:05:28,845 --> 01:05:30,138
You're such a fucking pussy.

821
01:05:31,014 --> 01:05:32,140
Okay.

822
01:05:32,349 --> 01:05:34,184
Life is about risk, Don.

823
01:05:34,351 --> 01:05:37,437
I can't, I don't, I don't....

824
01:05:37,645 --> 01:05:39,481
Do you need me to?

825
01:05:39,647 --> 01:05:41,607
How about you shut the fuck up
and do a line, Don.

826
01:05:41,649 --> 01:05:42,692
Okay.

827
01:05:43,443 --> 01:05:45,695
Okay. Line of meth.

828
01:05:47,280 --> 01:05:50,200
- It's the crystal meth?
- Yeah. Crystal, like champagne.

829
01:05:50,408 --> 01:05:52,369
I have always wondered what it was like.

830
01:05:55,038 --> 01:05:58,124
One deep breath. Plug the other nostril.
Don't embarrass yourself.

831
01:06:00,251 --> 01:06:01,461
Look at that!

832
01:06:03,380 --> 01:06:05,215
That burns! That really burns.

833
01:06:06,883 --> 01:06:09,302
That's because it's cut
with Tide and peyote, son!

834
01:06:09,928 --> 01:06:11,054
Why?

835
01:06:11,888 --> 01:06:14,224
Give it a couple minutes.
You're gonna be fucked.

836
01:06:15,642 --> 01:06:17,227
Now, Don.

837
01:06:17,394 --> 01:06:19,896
Don, I wanna know where my girl is.

838
01:06:21,898 --> 01:06:24,234
She left town to Dallas.

839
01:06:25,902 --> 01:06:26,945
Are you in love, Don?

840
01:06:27,153 --> 01:06:28,571
I'm in love with my wife.

841
01:06:29,072 --> 01:06:30,156
How's your wife feel...

842
01:06:30,323 --> 01:06:31,825
...about you burying your beef
inside my girl?

843
01:06:31,991 --> 01:06:33,993
She doesn't know
and she can never find out.

844
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:35,203
That's why I'm here.

845
01:06:36,162 --> 01:06:38,248
Well, guess what? That's up to me.

846
01:06:38,748 --> 01:06:39,916
- It is?
- Yeah.

847
01:06:42,252 --> 01:06:44,796
What can I do? I'll do anything.
You just let me know.

848
01:06:45,588 --> 01:06:48,800
Well, Don,
since that little skank left town...

849
01:06:48,967 --> 01:06:50,677
...you're on the hook with my money.

850
01:06:50,844 --> 01:06:53,430
You understand me? Yeah?

851
01:06:53,888 --> 01:06:55,765
I feel like my heart's about to explode.

852
01:06:55,974 --> 01:06:57,434
- You're okay.
- It's okay?

853
01:06:57,600 --> 01:07:01,104
- It's probably... You're good.
- It'll pass? Okay.

854
01:07:01,521 --> 01:07:02,772
I don't understand what he's saying.

855
01:07:02,939 --> 01:07:05,233
Don, you can sell your car,
your life insurance...

856
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,736
- ...but I want it by tomorrow.
- But what?

857
01:07:09,112 --> 01:07:11,990
- I want my 20,000, Don. Yeah.
- Yeah.

858
01:07:12,490 --> 01:07:14,784
Or I'm gonna rape your wife
and make you watch.

859
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:17,460
- And then your daughter.
- And then your son.

860
01:07:17,662 --> 01:07:18,872
And then you.

861
01:07:20,999 --> 01:07:23,960
With that big cock of mine.
Wow, look at that champagne.

862
01:07:25,462 --> 01:07:26,796
Pleasure's all mine.

863
01:07:47,984 --> 01:07:51,988
- What are you doing outside?
- The windows are just filthy.

864
01:07:52,322 --> 01:07:53,406
We need to leave.

865
01:07:53,573 --> 01:07:55,575
- What did he say?
- Right now. We have to go.

866
01:07:55,742 --> 01:07:57,535
Slow down. What did he say?

867
01:07:57,744 --> 01:08:00,914
He said that we have to give him
20,000 dollars...

868
01:08:01,081 --> 01:08:03,291
...or he's gonna rape us.

869
01:08:04,167 --> 01:08:06,836
- He said he was going to rape us?
- Yeah, the whole family.

870
01:08:07,003 --> 01:08:08,171
At the same time?

871
01:08:11,925 --> 01:08:13,051
What is wrong with you?

872
01:08:13,677 --> 01:08:15,011
They made me do crystal meth!

873
01:08:15,220 --> 01:08:16,721
- The drug?
- Yeah.

874
01:08:17,681 --> 01:08:18,848
I think it's the Tide.

875
01:08:19,182 --> 01:08:20,684
- Up your nose?
- Yeah.

876
01:08:22,352 --> 01:08:24,187
Well, did he ask about the girl?

877
01:08:24,354 --> 01:08:27,524
I told her... I told him
that she ran off to Dallas.

878
01:08:27,732 --> 01:08:30,819
- That's good, honey. That's very good.
- So, what should we do now?

879
01:08:31,528 --> 01:08:33,697
Well, we're gonna have to dig her up,
of course.

880
01:08:35,031 --> 01:08:38,618
And we'll have to drop the kids
at the Buckleys' for a sleepover.

881
01:08:39,869 --> 01:08:41,246
You've gotta drive!

882
01:08:51,423 --> 01:08:53,091
You're sure they are not here?

883
01:08:53,299 --> 01:08:57,095
Yes. He called. I've gotta meet him
in about a half an hour at the office.

884
01:08:57,554 --> 01:08:58,596
The office?

885
01:08:59,055 --> 01:09:00,390
The strip club.

886
01:09:03,268 --> 01:09:06,312
Why exactly did you bring a Zorro mask?

887
01:09:07,772 --> 01:09:09,065
I've been up for 29 hours.

888
01:09:10,191 --> 01:09:12,736
I am dressed for a covert operation.

889
01:09:13,319 --> 01:09:14,904
I'm gonna blend in with the night.

890
01:09:15,071 --> 01:09:16,364
- Stop it!
- What?

891
01:09:16,531 --> 01:09:17,991
- I will do this.
- No, you won't!

892
01:09:18,158 --> 01:09:20,493
- Yes, I want to do this.
- No, I want to do it more.

893
01:09:20,660 --> 01:09:22,620
You've gotta let me, Mona.
That's not fair.

894
01:09:23,038 --> 01:09:26,249
Listen to me. You cannot handle this.

895
01:09:26,624 --> 01:09:28,918
It's okay. It's okay.

896
01:09:29,252 --> 01:09:33,006
I'm the strong one.
I have come to accept that.

897
01:09:33,340 --> 01:09:34,841
That's not fair, Mona.

898
01:09:35,008 --> 01:09:36,760
I think I've done really well
under the circumstances.

899
01:09:36,926 --> 01:09:41,723
You can't even do a commercial
without overly sweating and mumbling!

900
01:09:42,557 --> 01:09:45,310
Now, I love you. I'll be back in a flash.

901
01:09:48,605 --> 01:09:50,357
God, this bitch is heavy!

902
01:10:42,200 --> 01:10:44,828
Should've gone in. Should've gone!

903
01:10:45,120 --> 01:10:48,873
"I'll do it! I can do it!
I'm gonna do it, Mona! I'm gonna do it!"

904
01:10:56,965 --> 01:10:59,634
"No! you stay and I will go!"

905
01:11:00,844 --> 01:11:02,971
"I will go!"
That's what you should have said.

906
01:11:04,514 --> 01:11:05,515
Oh, my God.

907
01:11:12,355 --> 01:11:13,690
Okay.

908
01:11:15,066 --> 01:11:16,693
That's it.

909
01:11:18,528 --> 01:11:20,572
Look alive, Champagne. Look alive.

910
01:11:26,411 --> 01:11:28,538
Oh, God. Oh, no, no, no. No, Mona.

911
01:11:31,041 --> 01:11:33,543
Get out of there, honey. Oh, God.

912
01:11:34,878 --> 01:11:36,046
Come on, come on.

913
01:11:37,088 --> 01:11:38,631
Back, are you back, are you back?

914
01:11:40,550 --> 01:11:44,054
What? What? No, no, no!

915
01:11:44,220 --> 01:11:46,806
Goddamn it, Mona,
why didn't you take your phone?

916
01:11:47,015 --> 01:11:48,058
Come on.

917
01:12:14,918 --> 01:12:18,046
Come here.
You ever been with a Scottish man?

918
01:12:27,263 --> 01:12:28,598
I've got a surprise for you.

919
01:12:29,099 --> 01:12:30,392
I can't get a little first?

920
01:12:35,814 --> 01:12:36,981
Right back!

921
01:12:53,623 --> 01:12:55,625
Dirty South Bitch!

922
01:13:12,308 --> 01:13:14,602
- You got a video camera?
- What?

923
01:13:19,274 --> 01:13:20,442
Hi.

924
01:13:21,776 --> 01:13:22,819
Hi.

925
01:13:27,198 --> 01:13:29,492
Wow, you smell fantastic.

926
01:13:30,118 --> 01:13:31,661
Thank you. It's Chanel.

927
01:13:32,454 --> 01:13:33,663
Are you my surprise?

928
01:13:34,998 --> 01:13:36,041
Yes.

929
01:13:39,294 --> 01:13:40,754
You taste like gummy bears.

930
01:13:42,172 --> 01:13:46,092
Shit! I gotta go, I gotta go, I gotta go.

931
01:13:53,183 --> 01:13:55,560
- Who the hell are you?
- I love her.

932
01:13:55,727 --> 01:13:57,771
- Who is this, Lynn?
- My surprise.

933
01:13:57,937 --> 01:14:01,608
No, no, no. I was just getting
my gold-plated cock ring.

934
01:14:02,359 --> 01:14:03,777
Hey, get off!

935
01:14:04,694 --> 01:14:08,782
Hold on. I've seen you before.
Yeah, I have.

936
01:14:08,990 --> 01:14:10,033
Get off!

937
01:14:10,533 --> 01:14:13,370
You gotta go, you gotta go. Shit!

938
01:14:13,912 --> 01:14:16,748
The furniture woman.
The furniture woman.

939
01:14:16,915 --> 01:14:19,709
What are you doing in my house?
Answer me!

940
01:15:18,268 --> 01:15:20,603
Oh, there you are.

941
01:15:22,564 --> 01:15:24,065
Holy shit.

942
01:15:43,918 --> 01:15:47,130
We need to go right now.

943
01:15:51,885 --> 01:15:56,681
Yes, I'd like to report a disturbance.

944
01:16:04,773 --> 01:16:07,025
Oh, fuck. What is it, man?
I'm banging Kelly.

945
01:16:09,486 --> 01:16:12,364
I'm bleeding really bad, bro.

946
01:16:12,614 --> 01:16:14,991
<i>- What?</i>
- All over my favorite kilt.

947
01:16:15,700 --> 01:16:17,494
What the fuck are you talking about?

948
01:16:17,786 --> 01:16:19,329
<i>The furniture people....</i>

949
01:16:20,038 --> 01:16:21,081
Get off me, get off.

950
01:16:21,247 --> 01:16:22,457
<i>The wife....</i>

951
01:16:23,833 --> 01:16:25,877
That wife was not a very good person.

952
01:16:26,044 --> 01:16:29,589
<i>The furniture store lady?
What the fuck are you talking about?</i>

953
01:16:29,756 --> 01:16:32,884
<i>- Freeman? What?</i>
- I'm dying.

954
01:16:33,134 --> 01:16:36,429
<i>- You're dying? What the fuck's going on?</i>
- Hurry home, bro.

955
01:16:36,596 --> 01:16:38,890
Freeman! Fuck!

956
01:16:50,652 --> 01:16:52,195
Oh, no.

957
01:17:20,682 --> 01:17:22,684
Freeman?
Freeman!

958
01:17:24,019 --> 01:17:25,061
Oh, no.

959
01:17:26,730 --> 01:17:27,814
Oh, God.

960
01:17:31,943 --> 01:17:35,280
- White picket fence motherfuckers.
- He say the furniture man did this?

961
01:17:35,739 --> 01:17:37,449
- He said she did it.
- The wife?

962
01:17:38,575 --> 01:17:39,826
Oh, God.

963
01:17:40,452 --> 01:17:44,289
Oh, my God.
They stabbed British Lynn with a sword.

964
01:17:47,208 --> 01:17:49,419
- What's wrong with those people?
- Monsters.

965
01:17:49,586 --> 01:17:51,421
She's dead, Murphy.

966
01:17:52,213 --> 01:17:53,548
She's dead.

967
01:17:54,424 --> 01:17:58,136
Freeman's dead too.
He bled out. Look at him.

968
01:17:58,428 --> 01:18:00,263
- Look, at him, Murphy!
- Benji!

969
01:18:00,847 --> 01:18:02,766
You need to pull yourself together, okay?

970
01:18:02,932 --> 01:18:05,769
I can't think
with you crying like a little bitch.

971
01:18:07,103 --> 01:18:08,146
All right.

972
01:18:11,107 --> 01:18:12,442
I did not see this coming.

973
01:18:21,076 --> 01:18:22,494
Jesus Christ.

974
01:18:29,459 --> 01:18:30,460
Fuck!

975
01:18:38,802 --> 01:18:42,639
It's a set-up, man. It's a fucking set up!

976
01:18:42,847 --> 01:18:44,933
Freeze! Throw down your weapons!

977
01:19:37,736 --> 01:19:40,030
- Hey, chief!
- Don.

978
01:19:41,573 --> 01:19:43,575
That sure is a pretty shine you got there.

979
01:19:43,867 --> 01:19:44,909
Mona's orders.

980
01:19:46,202 --> 01:19:48,038
So how goes it? What do you know?

981
01:19:49,164 --> 01:19:51,541
Well, Don,
I figured I'd come by here personally...

982
01:19:51,708 --> 01:19:53,376
...to let you know we found Dusty.

983
01:19:53,543 --> 01:19:54,544
Oh, great, you did.

984
01:19:54,711 --> 01:19:56,629
- How is she? Is she okay?
- No, she's dead.

985
01:19:57,047 --> 01:19:58,548
And in addition to poor Dusty...

986
01:19:58,715 --> 01:20:00,717
...there was another young woman
they stabbed to death...

987
01:20:00,884 --> 01:20:03,386
...with a Samurai sword
right through her mid-section.

988
01:20:04,220 --> 01:20:07,974
Like a kabob of sorts. It was disgusting.

989
01:20:08,683 --> 01:20:10,101
Kabob....

990
01:20:10,268 --> 01:20:13,229
Like a kabob with seepage.

991
01:20:13,855 --> 01:20:15,523
Well, did you catch them?

992
01:20:15,690 --> 01:20:17,567
Two of them.
Both dead.

993
01:20:18,068 --> 01:20:21,071
One of them's still on the loose.
But don't worry, We'll get him.

994
01:20:22,572 --> 01:20:23,615
Okay.

995
01:20:25,909 --> 01:20:27,410
We love what you've done
with your lawn, Don.

996
01:20:27,577 --> 01:20:29,162
- Oh, thanks.
- Muffy! Any chance you'd like to come by...

997
01:20:29,329 --> 01:20:31,809
...and have a refreshing beverage with us
and talk fertilizers?

998
01:20:31,831 --> 01:20:34,250
Yeah, I'd love... No, you know.

999
01:20:34,918 --> 01:20:37,420
You don't want to know
what I'm going to do...

1000
01:20:37,587 --> 01:20:41,257
...if I catch this dog
on my property again, ladies.

1001
01:20:42,759 --> 01:20:44,177
Okay, Mona.

1002
01:20:44,761 --> 01:20:46,221
She's just kidding.

1003
01:20:46,554 --> 01:20:47,764
- Bye.
- Yeah, we'll see you.

1004
01:20:47,972 --> 01:20:51,434
Chief, can I interest you in some dinner?
I've cooked up some artichokes.

1005
01:20:52,102 --> 01:20:54,646
Work's kind of been piling up on me,
so....

1006
01:20:54,813 --> 01:20:56,940
- Well, maybe next time.
- Maybe.

1007
01:20:59,109 --> 01:21:00,694
Maybe next time, chief.

1008
01:21:00,860 --> 01:21:02,654
Listen, Don, something else came up...

1009
01:21:02,821 --> 01:21:04,614
...we thought
you might be able to help us out with.

1010
01:21:04,781 --> 01:21:06,241
Yep. What's that?

1011
01:21:06,783 --> 01:21:08,910
Well, you see, Don, it turns out that....

1012
01:21:11,037 --> 01:21:14,207
Some girls over at that lodge
where them fellas did their business...

1013
01:21:14,666 --> 01:21:17,168
...they described someone
that looked just like you.

1014
01:21:17,419 --> 01:21:18,461
Me?

1015
01:21:18,628 --> 01:21:20,505
Came in there a couple days ago.

1016
01:21:28,805 --> 01:21:33,309
I'm not gonna lie to you, chief,
because, you don't deserve to be lied to.

1017
01:21:33,518 --> 01:21:36,688
I'm gonna come perfectly clean
because that's the Don Champagne way.

1018
01:21:41,818 --> 01:21:43,987
I was having an affair with Dusty...

1019
01:21:44,487 --> 01:21:48,241
...and one day her boyfriend
comes into the store...

1020
01:21:48,408 --> 01:21:51,202
...and demands to be paid
or he's gonna tell Mona.

1021
01:21:52,579 --> 01:21:57,000
So that's why I went to the "lodge."
To pay him off.

1022
01:22:03,631 --> 01:22:05,675
- Is that the boyfriend?
- That's him. Yeah.

1023
01:22:07,010 --> 01:22:08,053
I see.

1024
01:22:08,887 --> 01:22:11,222
- Chief, if Mona finds out...
- Oh, I know.

1025
01:22:11,598 --> 01:22:15,685
- I know. We don't want Mona to find out.
- No, we don't.

1026
01:22:16,061 --> 01:22:19,314
Because then that would be
another dead body I'd have to look into.

1027
01:22:27,530 --> 01:22:30,200
Your parents gonna be here tomorrow
for Andrew's birthday?

1028
01:22:30,367 --> 01:22:32,243
I don't think
they're gonna be able to make it.

1029
01:22:32,452 --> 01:22:33,912
But they'll be here soon enough...

1030
01:22:34,079 --> 01:22:36,456
...so make sure the yard
is in perfect order anyway.

1031
01:22:44,547 --> 01:22:47,592
Do you think they did anything to you
when you were younger?

1032
01:22:47,926 --> 01:22:49,052
Who?

1033
01:22:49,719 --> 01:22:50,845
Your parents.

1034
01:22:51,429 --> 01:22:52,764
What are you talking about?

1035
01:22:53,181 --> 01:22:55,392
You know. Something bad.

1036
01:22:56,976 --> 01:22:59,646
To make you the way that you are.

1037
01:23:05,110 --> 01:23:06,653
And how's that, Don?

1038
01:23:09,155 --> 01:23:11,074
It's an honest question, Mona.

1039
01:23:13,326 --> 01:23:14,661
How dare you?

1040
01:23:16,746 --> 01:23:20,250
I am your husband.
If you can't tell me, who can you tell?

1041
01:23:20,417 --> 01:23:22,002
- There's nothing to tell!
- Okay.

1042
01:23:22,544 --> 01:23:25,296
I have...

1043
01:23:25,463 --> 01:23:27,090
I have a medical condition...

1044
01:23:27,257 --> 01:23:29,009
...but it's not because of my parents.

1045
01:23:29,217 --> 01:23:31,886
Well, it usually starts
with the upbringing, that's all.

1046
01:23:32,053 --> 01:23:33,304
Oh, God.

1047
01:23:34,472 --> 01:23:36,433
Oh, honey, honey, honey.

1048
01:23:36,641 --> 01:23:41,312
My parents never did anything to me.
My parents are perfect parents.

1049
01:23:41,896 --> 01:23:45,191
They never hit me. They never hurt me....

1050
01:23:45,400 --> 01:23:47,610
Sweetie, come here, come here.

1051
01:23:47,861 --> 01:23:50,697
Come here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Damn it.

1052
01:23:50,989 --> 01:23:52,157
I didn't...

1053
01:23:52,699 --> 01:23:56,119
They're very hard on you. On us.

1054
01:23:56,411 --> 01:24:00,373
And I just... I shouldn't have said it.

1055
01:24:00,540 --> 01:24:03,001
And it's just....

1056
01:24:03,168 --> 01:24:06,254
It's just been a little crazy lately.
That's all.

1057
01:24:16,014 --> 01:24:17,182
I love you, Don.

1058
01:24:18,308 --> 01:24:19,476
I love you too.

1059
01:24:21,144 --> 01:24:23,646
But if you ever talk to
me like that again....

1060
01:24:25,440 --> 01:24:26,858
I will end you.

1061
01:24:28,068 --> 01:24:29,652
I will get one of the knives...

1062
01:24:32,364 --> 01:24:34,157
...out of my bedside drawer...

1063
01:24:37,243 --> 01:24:39,120
...and I will gut you...

1064
01:24:40,121 --> 01:24:41,623
...and dismember you...

1065
01:24:42,457 --> 01:24:44,250
...like that wench you screwed.

1066
01:24:50,423 --> 01:24:52,217
Do you understand, Don Champagne?

1067
01:24:55,303 --> 01:24:58,848
Yeah. I understand.

1068
01:25:06,064 --> 01:25:07,941
- Good.
- Okay.

1069
01:25:33,383 --> 01:25:37,637
We need to discuss
the Les and A.J. situation...

1070
01:25:37,804 --> 01:25:39,472
...before the party tomorrow.

1071
01:25:45,687 --> 01:25:48,273
Focus, Don. This is important.

1072
01:25:50,358 --> 01:25:52,402
That family thinks they're better than us.

1073
01:25:53,445 --> 01:25:57,532
I won't have Andrew
compete against a child on steroids.

1074
01:25:58,241 --> 01:26:00,201
It's ruining his self-confidence.

1075
01:26:00,410 --> 01:26:05,206
He's not on steroids, Mona.
He's just a big-boned kid.

1076
01:26:06,291 --> 01:26:07,709
We've been through this.

1077
01:26:08,918 --> 01:26:13,173
Well,
if we don't get rid of them tomorrow...

1078
01:26:13,340 --> 01:26:15,884
...then when will we get rid of them?

1079
01:26:18,094 --> 01:26:20,180
What do you mean, "get rid of"?

1080
01:26:22,849 --> 01:26:25,769
Come on, A.J. Come on, you'll break it!

1081
01:26:26,269 --> 01:26:27,312
Come on, A.J.

1082
01:26:27,479 --> 01:26:29,814
Swing it like you swing that baseball bat!
Hit it!

1083
01:26:59,386 --> 01:27:03,390
Come on, focus. You can break it. Hit it!

1084
01:27:03,598 --> 01:27:06,309
Wait Wait. Wait.

1085
01:27:08,311 --> 01:27:10,814
Easy! It's just a game.

1086
01:27:11,314 --> 01:27:13,316
I am this close...

1087
01:27:13,483 --> 01:27:16,194
...to telling the Little League committee
about your scam.

1088
01:27:16,528 --> 01:27:19,155
Ten years old? Who are we kidding?

1089
01:27:19,322 --> 01:27:22,367
What are you inferring?
I don't know what you're talking about.

1090
01:27:22,534 --> 01:27:24,577
Your kid is a cheater!

1091
01:27:24,744 --> 01:27:26,079
And you're an alcoholic.

1092
01:27:26,621 --> 01:27:30,583
I can smell the booze
seeping out of your fat pores right now.

1093
01:27:30,834 --> 01:27:33,211
- You can't talk to him like that!
- Abby, Abby.

1094
01:27:36,923 --> 01:27:38,883
I'm glad you have Crohn's.

1095
01:27:40,343 --> 01:27:43,805
I hope you shit yourself to death.

1096
01:27:49,811 --> 01:27:52,981
Mona, you... You're just unstable.

1097
01:27:56,651 --> 01:27:57,694
I'm coming, honey.

1098
01:28:01,197 --> 01:28:02,907
- Hit it, Andrew.
- It's okay.

1099
01:28:04,617 --> 01:28:05,744
Hit it, Andrew!

1100
01:28:07,579 --> 01:28:10,040
- There you go, you got this.
- Come on.

1101
01:28:10,790 --> 01:28:13,043
- Great job, Andrew.
- That's right, come on.

1102
01:28:13,585 --> 01:28:14,711
Come on, buddy.

1103
01:28:29,976 --> 01:28:32,437
Hit it harder! Yes!

1104
01:28:33,605 --> 01:28:37,525
Yes! Yay, you did it!

1105
01:28:42,739 --> 01:28:46,451
It's your lack of focus, Andrew.

1106
01:28:46,951 --> 01:28:48,370
Shut up, Allison.

1107
01:28:49,537 --> 01:28:52,916
Good girl. You're so strong.
Get some candy.

1108
01:30:10,452 --> 01:30:11,494
Hey.

1109
01:30:13,079 --> 01:30:14,247
I love you.

1110
01:30:19,878 --> 01:30:21,588
- I see that.
- Yeah.

1111
01:30:21,796 --> 01:30:23,214
Hey. Where you going?

1112
01:30:23,882 --> 01:30:24,924
What is it?

1113
01:30:25,091 --> 01:30:27,969
I need you to keep an eye
on Lanny at the grill.

1114
01:30:28,136 --> 01:30:30,616
- He's supposed to be watching it.
- But I wanna get my Frisbee...

1115
01:30:30,680 --> 01:30:33,892
I'll grab it. Just go on out there,
keep an eye on him. I don't trust him.

1116
01:30:34,267 --> 01:30:35,310
Okay.

1117
01:30:39,647 --> 01:30:41,066
- Sweetheart?
- Yeah?

1118
01:30:41,274 --> 01:30:45,278
Maybe we should go on vacation.
Get away from all this madness.

1119
01:30:48,448 --> 01:30:51,034
I'd like that very much.

1120
01:30:51,368 --> 01:30:52,952
Good. I'll put it on the calendar.

1121
01:30:53,870 --> 01:30:54,871
Hey, Mona?

1122
01:30:59,959 --> 01:31:01,670
Would you mind
going out to the fridge in the garage...

1123
01:31:01,836 --> 01:31:04,714
...and getting me some ground beef?
I gotta go check on the grill.

1124
01:31:05,090 --> 01:31:06,132
Of course, sugar.

1125
01:31:10,345 --> 01:31:11,638
- Love you.
- Love you.

1126
01:31:14,516 --> 01:31:16,267
More than the moon and the stars.

1127
01:33:05,794 --> 01:33:08,880
<i>Help! Help!</i>
