<i>This is an emergency.</i>

2
00:03:43,891 --> 00:03:45,557
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

3
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:09,715
<i>Homicides in Chicago, Illinois,</i>

4
00:04:09,717 --> 00:04:12,317

<i>Over 400 school-aged kids</i>

<i>American independence day,</i>

<i>and 10 were murdered,</i>

11

<i>including a seven-year-old boy.</i>

12
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:39,044
<i>Where was their freedom?</i>

13
00:04:39,046 --> 00:04:42,514
<i>Where was their right</i>
<i>to life, Liberty,</i>

14
00:04:42,516 --> 00:04:45,584
<i>and the pursuit of happiness?</i>

15
00:04:45,586 --> 00:04:48,920
<i>These overwhelming</i>

16
00:04:48,922 --> 00:04:52,424

17

<i>against young black males.</i>

18
00:04:55,929 --> 00:04:58,597
<i>Heaven help us all.</i>

19
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:40,972
All right, peace out.

20
00:05:42,810 --> 00:05:44,643
- Cairo!
- What's up, what's up?

21
00:05:44,645 --> 00:05:46,111
What's up, man?
You good? You good?

22
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:49,481
We good, we good. What up?

23
00:05:49,483 --> 00:05:51,416
Whoa, whoa, whoa, back up.
Back the fuck up.

24
00:05:51,418 --> 00:05:54,586
Back the fuck up. Come on, man.
Come on, son.

25
00:05:54,588 --> 00:05:55,854
Why you want to do that?

26
00:05:55,856 --> 00:05:57,656
Chi-raq! Chi-raq!

27
00:05:57,658 --> 00:05:59,458
Chi-raq! Chi-raq!

28
00:05:59,460 --> 00:06:02,994
Chi-raq! Chi-raq!
Chi-raq! Chi-raq!

29
00:06:02,996 --> 00:06:05,697
In the year 411 bc...

30
00:06:05,699 --> 00:06:08,133
that's before
baby Jesus, y'all...

31
00:06:08,135 --> 00:06:11,002
the Greek aristophanes
penned a play

32
00:06:11,004 --> 00:06:13,004
satirizing his day.

33
00:06:13,006 --> 00:06:15,674
And in the style of his time,

34
00:06:15,676 --> 00:06:18,143
'stophanes made
that shit rhyme.

35
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:21,146
Transplanted today,
we retain his verse

36
00:06:21,148 --> 00:06:24,416
to show our love
for the universe.

37
00:06:24,418 --> 00:06:27,853
But warning!
You gonna see some pain!

38
00:06:27,855 --> 00:06:31,523
But that's only natural,
'cause it involves the gangs.

39
00:06:31,525 --> 00:06:33,525
So before I unfreeze these gs,

40
00:06:33,527 --> 00:06:35,861
like the stats
you heard before...

41
00:06:35,863 --> 00:06:38,397
people, people, people,

42
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,699
we can't take too much more!

43
00:06:40,701 --> 00:06:43,435
Chi-raq! Chi-raq! Chi-raq!

44
00:06:43,437 --> 00:06:45,170
Chi-raq! Chi-raq!

45
00:06:52,545 --> 00:06:54,713
<i>Everybody make some noise!</i>

46
00:06:59,419 --> 00:07:00,819
Hey, all y'all.

47
00:07:00,821 --> 00:07:03,555
Yeah!

48
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:05,123
Yeah!

49
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:14,666
- Yo, what's up?
<i>- What up, my boy?</i>

50
00:07:14,668 --> 00:07:16,868
- T-money!
- <i> Yeah!</i>

51
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,938
I love you, baby.

52
00:07:21,108 --> 00:07:22,707
On my soul, this is my city.

53
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:27,479
Rest in peace, cyclops.

54
00:07:28,781 --> 00:07:30,081
- I'm sprung.
- Yup.

55
00:09:16,690 --> 00:09:19,958
I told you! I told you!

56
00:09:38,045 --> 00:09:39,611
<i>Oh, shit, what
the fuck you doing?</i>

57
00:09:40,981 --> 00:09:42,314
<i>Man, get the fuck</i>
<i>out of my way!</i>

58
00:09:42,316 --> 00:09:43,748
<i>Don't shoot! That's my man!</i>

59
00:09:43,750 --> 00:09:46,017
- Back the fuck up!
- Oh, shit!

60
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:48,353
Back the fuck up!
Back the fuck up!

61
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:15,013
Tonight was mad hectic, yo.

62
00:10:15,015 --> 00:10:16,748
Shit, I respect it.

63
00:10:16,750 --> 00:10:18,383
My little nigga t-money
took that hit.

64
00:10:18,385 --> 00:10:20,385
Better be glad it was just
a flesh wound and shit,

65
00:10:20,387 --> 00:10:22,153
'cause when my gun go boom,

66
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:24,255
I make sure a trojan end up
in the next room and shit.

67
00:10:24,257 --> 00:10:27,325
<i>Spartans ain't never lacking.</i>
<i>We attacking in this bitch.</i>

68
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:30,028
I swear to god, I emptied
out a whole extendo clip.

69
00:10:30,030 --> 00:10:33,331
Ho-ass trojans wanna trip over
some text message bullshit?

70
00:10:33,333 --> 00:10:36,001
Three dudes all shot up
behind some text messages?

71
00:10:36,003 --> 00:10:36,797
No question.

72
00:10:36,823 --> 00:10:39,971
You know I was scared
for you and me both.

73
00:10:39,973 --> 00:10:42,040
Girl, you know
your nigga is invincible.

74
00:10:42,042 --> 00:10:45,143
They want to kill me, them motherfuckers
better bring a Iram missile.

75
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:47,779
Fuck them niggas
from Troy town.

76
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:50,882
I've been waiting all night
to take your fine ass down.

77
00:10:50,884 --> 00:10:53,218
You ready for daddy
to smash that cake?

78
00:10:53,220 --> 00:10:54,986
Shit, I've got that long d.

79
00:10:54,988 --> 00:10:57,956
I know your ass can't wait.

80
00:10:57,958 --> 00:11:01,793
Freaky-deaky
all up in that butt.

81
00:11:01,795 --> 00:11:05,130
Come on, girl,
let's bust this nut, mm!

82
00:11:05,132 --> 00:11:06,831
It don't get no gooder.

83
00:11:06,833 --> 00:11:09,134
Girl, you finer
than granulated sugar.

84
00:11:09,136 --> 00:11:10,969
Guess I better press my luck.

85
00:11:10,971 --> 00:11:13,938
You just like my credit,
bad as fuck.

86
00:11:13,940 --> 00:11:15,240
We could've got killed.

87
00:11:15,242 --> 00:11:17,275
I gotta look at that tonight?

88
00:11:17,277 --> 00:11:19,377
Out of sight.

89
00:11:19,379 --> 00:11:22,747
I got another pistol that's
gonna make everything a'ight.

90
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,783
Just make sure it's loaded.

91
00:11:24,785 --> 00:11:27,118
You know what I like.

92
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:44,135
You outside, no fun.

93
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,437
And he inside getting some.

94
00:11:45,439 --> 00:11:48,406
You feel? Spit your lick.

95
00:11:48,408 --> 00:11:50,475
Come on, man. Spartans, yo.

96
00:11:50,477 --> 00:11:52,377
No.

97
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,985
No music? No nothing?

98
00:12:00,987 --> 00:12:03,021
Nothing but the beat
of the headboard bumping

99
00:12:03,023 --> 00:12:04,823
when my third leg go thumping.

100
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,357
Slow down.

101
00:12:06,359 --> 00:12:08,126
You gotta bring me the romance.

102
00:12:08,128 --> 00:12:09,861
Then maybe, like biggie,

103
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:12,497
I give your ass
one more chance.

104
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:13,865
Okay, okay.

105
00:12:13,867 --> 00:12:15,133
Well, like 'pac say,

106
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:18,503
I can't wait to get you home,

107
00:12:18,505 --> 00:12:21,039
- get you all alone.
- Mm-hmm.

108
00:12:21,041 --> 00:12:22,507
Get you home in my bedroom.

109
00:12:22,509 --> 00:12:25,143
Maybe we could bone
and get it on.

110
00:12:25,145 --> 00:12:26,878
Got a lot of thug in me.

111
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,880
I wanna put it in you.

112
00:12:28,882 --> 00:12:31,449
Hey, goofy,
why do I stay with you?

113
00:12:31,451 --> 00:12:34,519
Because you know chi-raq
will make you stammer

114
00:12:34,521 --> 00:12:38,223
when I crack your back
with this spartan hammer.

115
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:40,458
Chi, bang it.

116
00:13:01,081 --> 00:13:03,314
Oh, chi.

117
00:13:03,316 --> 00:13:05,183
Oh, chi!

118
00:13:07,253 --> 00:13:08,920
You smell something?

119
00:13:08,922 --> 00:13:12,924
Yeah. S-e-x.

120
00:13:12,926 --> 00:13:15,493
What's that? What's that?

121
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:17,228
What the fuck?

122
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,364
Oh, shit!

123
00:13:19,366 --> 00:13:20,398
Fuck.

124
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,234
Come on, motherfucker!

125
00:13:23,236 --> 00:13:25,203
Get out of here!

126
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:26,204
<i>Burn, baby.</i>

127
00:13:26,206 --> 00:13:27,572
Please, baby.

128
00:13:27,574 --> 00:13:30,275
Disco inferno.

129
00:13:30,277 --> 00:13:31,976
Go, go, go!

130
00:13:31,978 --> 00:13:34,879
Go, go! Trojans! Go!

131
00:13:39,820 --> 00:13:41,452
- You dead, nigga!
- You missed me!

132
00:13:41,454 --> 00:13:44,923
On my mama, you dead,
old-ass motherfucker!

133
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:46,457
Call the fire department!

134
00:13:46,459 --> 00:13:48,927
<i>Somebody call</i>
<i>the fire department!</i>

135
00:13:55,234 --> 00:13:56,401
What are you looking at?

136
00:13:57,603 --> 00:13:59,304
Nothing.

137
00:13:59,306 --> 00:14:01,439
Absolutely nothing!

138
00:14:30,337 --> 00:14:32,203
- Morning, tootie!
- Hey, hey!

139
00:14:38,511 --> 00:14:40,545
Hey, Lysistrata! What it do?

140
00:14:40,547 --> 00:14:41,980
What's up, Spinna?

141
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:50,054
<i>Wake up!</i>

142
00:14:50,056 --> 00:14:51,990
Hey, Dolmedes!

143
00:14:51,992 --> 00:14:53,992
Welcome to chi-raq,

144
00:14:53,994 --> 00:14:57,128
the land of pain,
misery, and strife.

145
00:14:57,130 --> 00:14:59,664
Folks, our windy city
been filleted

146
00:14:59,666 --> 00:15:02,200
with a king-size butcher knife.

147
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:04,535
Like a monster
from outer space,

148
00:15:04,537 --> 00:15:06,304
the great state of Drillanois

149
00:15:06,306 --> 00:15:10,041
has been hit by a murderous,
big-ass killeroid.

150
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,143
And that's real shit,

151
00:15:12,145 --> 00:15:14,679
where the big moneymaker
is the black suit undertaker.

152
00:15:14,681 --> 00:15:16,547
But don't pity our pain.

153
00:15:16,549 --> 00:15:19,384
Might ain't always right,
ain't you heard?

154
00:15:19,386 --> 00:15:21,986
And this coming
from a natural man.

155
00:15:21,988 --> 00:15:24,522
Baby, you've come face-to-face

156
00:15:24,524 --> 00:15:28,126
with the super bad
Mr. Dolmedes.

157
00:15:28,128 --> 00:15:31,229
My black ass was on
the first box of wheaties.

158
00:15:31,231 --> 00:15:34,065
I was raised up
in a pail of rusted nails,

159
00:15:34,067 --> 00:15:37,235
ran buck naked through
golf ball-sized hail,

160
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:40,571
was weaned on thunderbird
from my mama's titty.

161
00:15:40,573 --> 00:15:42,607
Kicked ass from coast to coast

162
00:15:42,609 --> 00:15:44,709
till both shoe toes
were shitty.

163
00:15:44,711 --> 00:15:48,079
Chewed up electric lines
and pissed out lightning bolts.

164
00:15:48,081 --> 00:15:51,683
Hit Godzilla so hard,
it gave Mothra's daddy a jolt.

165
00:15:51,685 --> 00:15:54,719
Sank the Titanic
with a frozen turd,

166
00:15:54,721 --> 00:15:57,422
then won 10 Grammys
and didn't sing or rap

167
00:15:57,424 --> 00:16:00,325
one goddamn motherfucking word.

168
00:16:00,327 --> 00:16:04,262
Now, I told you about the signifying
monkey and rapped about shine,

169
00:16:04,264 --> 00:16:06,731
but this here
tale of two cities

170
00:16:06,733 --> 00:16:08,666
is one of a kind.

171
00:16:08,668 --> 00:16:12,403
It all started with
a gorgeous nubian sister.

172
00:16:12,405 --> 00:16:14,605
<i>Baby so fine,</i>
<i>she made George Zimmerman</i>

173
00:16:14,607 --> 00:16:16,607
<i>and Darren Wilson</i>
<i>wanna kiss her.</i>

174
00:16:16,609 --> 00:16:20,611
<i>As tough as Coffy</i>
<i>and sexy as Foxy Brown.</i>

175
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:24,282
<i>Hell, Beyoncé Knowles herself
even had to bow down.</i>

176
00:16:24,284 --> 00:16:26,217
<i>They call herLysistrata,</i>

177
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:28,119
a woman like no other.

178
00:16:28,121 --> 00:16:30,288
This chocolate brown sister

179
00:16:30,290 --> 00:16:32,757
was finer than a motherfucker.

180
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:35,126
She could put fear
in a pit bull,

181
00:16:35,128 --> 00:16:38,129
made Bruce Lee flee,
knocked out Frazier and Ali,

182
00:16:38,131 --> 00:16:41,132
<i>then ran money Mayweather</i>
<i>up a sycamore tree.</i>

183
00:16:41,134 --> 00:16:43,134
<i>With a mind like Einstein</i>

184
00:16:43,136 --> 00:16:44,602
- <i> and a truly...</i>
- Yo, what's up, girl?

185
00:16:44,604 --> 00:16:46,371
<i>Luscious behind,</i>

186
00:16:46,373 --> 00:16:49,107
that gal put gap-goody hurting

187
00:16:49,109 --> 00:16:51,609
on all mankind.

188
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:02,153
Drive-by. Spartans
and trojans beefing.

189
00:17:02,155 --> 00:17:04,789
Little girl, Patti,
wrong place, wrong time.

190
00:17:04,791 --> 00:17:06,257
Messed up.

191
00:17:06,259 --> 00:17:08,760
Barbara, you see the shooter?

192
00:17:16,502 --> 00:17:19,103
<i>Behind the yellow tape.
Know what I'm saying?</i>

193
00:17:19,105 --> 00:17:20,805
<i>Behind the yellow tape.</i>

194
00:17:20,807 --> 00:17:22,340
<i>Oh, boy.</i>

195
00:17:22,342 --> 00:17:23,508
Somebody called me to tell me...

196
00:17:23,510 --> 00:17:25,343
- ma'am, please.
- What happened?

197
00:17:25,345 --> 00:17:27,111
- What's going on?
- Ma'am.

198
00:17:28,514 --> 00:17:31,416
My baby. That's my baby.

199
00:17:31,418 --> 00:17:32,517
Ma'am, please.

200
00:17:32,519 --> 00:17:35,053
Is that my...

201
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,788
- Is that... what happened?
- Ma'am...

202
00:17:36,790 --> 00:17:38,256
You have to go
down to the morgue

203
00:17:38,258 --> 00:17:40,691
for identification, ma'am.

204
00:17:40,693 --> 00:17:42,693
But that's my baby.

205
00:17:42,695 --> 00:17:44,629
Is that my...

206
00:17:44,631 --> 00:17:45,830
- Patti!
- You can't cross the line, ma'am.

207
00:17:45,832 --> 00:17:47,165
Please.

208
00:17:50,369 --> 00:17:51,602
Did y'all see something?

209
00:17:54,373 --> 00:17:56,140
You ain't seen nothing?

210
00:17:56,142 --> 00:17:57,842
Ain't nobody out here
seen nothing?

211
00:17:57,844 --> 00:18:00,211
And I can't even get
to my own child!

212
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:03,214
- I'm sorry, ma'am.
- What happened? Don't touch me!

213
00:18:03,216 --> 00:18:05,083
You don't even deserve
to look at my child's body

214
00:18:05,085 --> 00:18:06,717
laying right there
on this ground!

215
00:18:06,719 --> 00:18:08,186
None of you!

216
00:18:13,392 --> 00:18:15,560
<i>You gonna get</i>
<i>your day, Lysistrata.</i>

217
00:18:15,562 --> 00:18:17,328
<i>You and your damn boyfriend.</i>

218
00:18:17,330 --> 00:18:18,729
You got what's coming.

219
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:20,364
I want you to look at her.

220
00:18:20,366 --> 00:18:23,201
<i>Look at her right there.</i>

221
00:18:23,203 --> 00:18:25,570
That's a seven... a little baby!

222
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:26,838
A baby!

223
00:18:30,409 --> 00:18:31,843
A baby.

224
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:40,585
I can't take this no more.

225
00:18:40,587 --> 00:18:42,386
Your daughter's in heaven.

226
00:18:45,424 --> 00:18:47,525
<i>Because it could
be you next time!</i>

227
00:18:47,527 --> 00:18:49,527
Will you be standing
around looking then?

228
00:19:10,449 --> 00:19:12,583
This nothing has nowhere to go.

229
00:19:14,453 --> 00:19:16,287
Welcome to my home.

230
00:19:16,289 --> 00:19:18,422
Come on in. Come on.

231
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:28,766
<i>Why don't you move
in with that boy of yours,</i>

232
00:19:28,768 --> 00:19:31,636
machine gun Kelly?

233
00:19:31,638 --> 00:19:34,639
Wouldn't be safe.

234
00:19:34,641 --> 00:19:38,643
I suppose he'll be gunning
for who set that fire.

235
00:19:38,645 --> 00:19:41,879
Y'all make my tired ass tired.

236
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:43,814
There are children here
in Englewood.

237
00:19:43,816 --> 00:19:45,650
Does that mean anything to you?

238
00:19:45,652 --> 00:19:47,818
Running up the street,
shooting and killing.

239
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:50,321
Do you care at all?

240
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:53,491
- Maybe I should leave.
- No. Sit.

241
00:19:53,493 --> 00:19:54,759
Stay.

242
00:19:54,761 --> 00:19:57,528
You're gonna deal
with this today.

243
00:20:06,338 --> 00:20:07,471
You don't have any family?

244
00:20:07,473 --> 00:20:09,840
No, ma'am.

245
00:20:09,842 --> 00:20:11,976
I'm an orphan.

246
00:20:11,978 --> 00:20:15,680
My moms put me up
for adoption at birth.

247
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:18,849
I grew up moving from one
group home to another.

248
00:20:18,851 --> 00:20:20,351
Hmm.

249
00:20:20,353 --> 00:20:22,587
Lord help you, child.

250
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:25,923
Where's your flat-screen?

251
00:20:27,359 --> 00:20:28,859
Malcolm X once said

252
00:20:28,861 --> 00:20:31,696
the best way to hide
something from negroes

253
00:20:31,698 --> 00:20:33,531
is to put it in a book.

254
00:20:33,533 --> 00:20:37,001
Well, I can dig it, miss Helen.

255
00:20:37,003 --> 00:20:38,636
You sure got mad books.

256
00:20:38,638 --> 00:20:40,538
Books are my life.

257
00:20:40,540 --> 00:20:42,707
My life for books.

258
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,375
You always live here?

259
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:48,546
No. I lived in cabrini-green
back when it was clean,

260
00:20:48,548 --> 00:20:50,381
before they knocked it down.

261
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:52,683
Oh, a lot of black folk
got gentrified across town.

262
00:20:54,387 --> 00:20:57,521
- Who's this?
- My daughter Pam.

263
00:20:57,523 --> 00:21:01,492
- Let me guess. 10?
- That's right.

264
00:21:01,494 --> 00:21:03,027
<i>Fifth grade class picture.</i>

265
00:21:04,864 --> 00:21:06,297
Girl, come away
from that window.

266
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:09,300
- Hurry.
- It's chi-raq.

267
00:21:09,302 --> 00:21:11,602
<i>Oh, my god!</i>

268
00:21:15,507 --> 00:21:17,375
Chi-raq.

269
00:21:17,377 --> 00:21:19,910
I hate that name.
It's not who we are.

270
00:21:19,912 --> 00:21:23,314
Chicago always been
a straight up gangsta town.

271
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:24,582
We are not chi-raq.

272
00:21:24,584 --> 00:21:26,417
So what you call
all these shootings?

273
00:21:26,419 --> 00:21:28,019
Crime? Doing time?

274
00:21:28,021 --> 00:21:30,421
It's not just about Chicago.

275
00:21:30,423 --> 00:21:32,356
What about
Bodymore, Murderland?

276
00:21:32,358 --> 00:21:35,593
Killa-delphia,
city of brotherly murder?

277
00:21:35,595 --> 00:21:37,628
Bucktown... Brooklyn, New York.

278
00:21:37,630 --> 00:21:40,498
So many people getting shot,
hospital's going broke.

279
00:21:40,500 --> 00:21:41,900
I mean, you got to get
on the e-way.

280
00:21:41,901 --> 00:21:43,034
People dying en route.

281
00:21:43,036 --> 00:21:45,036
They can't even file a lawsuit.

282
00:21:45,038 --> 00:21:48,072
I mean, there still ain't no trauma
centers here on the south side.

283
00:21:48,074 --> 00:21:50,941
There was a time in the
summer when it got hot.

284
00:21:50,943 --> 00:21:53,944
Your child could go outside
and play and not get shot.

285
00:21:53,946 --> 00:21:56,347
- Oh, I don't remember that time.
- It existed.

286
00:21:56,349 --> 00:21:59,550
I'm sorry, miss Helen, but
it's a war zone out here.

287
00:21:59,552 --> 00:22:02,453
The us spends money
on the Iraqi people,

288
00:22:02,455 --> 00:22:03,788
to train them, govern them,

289
00:22:03,790 --> 00:22:05,790
help them build an economy...

290
00:22:05,792 --> 00:22:07,425
billions and billions
in dollars.

291
00:22:07,427 --> 00:22:09,460
The Afghan people, too.

292
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:12,596
They don't do economic development
like that here on the south side.

293
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:15,900
See, Americans like war.

294
00:22:15,902 --> 00:22:18,102
They like guns.

295
00:22:18,104 --> 00:22:20,404
- Fun and games.
- Fun and games?

296
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:22,807
Ask the parents at Sandy hook.

297
00:22:22,809 --> 00:22:25,743
When they murder white babies
and things don't change,

298
00:22:25,745 --> 00:22:28,646
saving black life
is way out of range.

299
00:22:28,648 --> 00:22:31,649
I keep thinking about that
mother that lost her child.

300
00:22:31,651 --> 00:22:32,783
You should.

301
00:22:34,986 --> 00:22:37,621
- This boy you with.
- Chi-raq?

302
00:22:37,623 --> 00:22:39,390
- What?
- That's what they call him.

303
00:22:39,392 --> 00:22:42,126
Wait a minute, now. Hold on.

304
00:22:42,128 --> 00:22:43,994
They call him chi-raq?

305
00:22:43,996 --> 00:22:45,396
Yes, ma'am.

306
00:22:45,398 --> 00:22:48,432
Lord, have mercy!

307
00:22:48,434 --> 00:22:50,000
He's a rapper.

308
00:22:50,002 --> 00:22:53,671
I mean, gonna be
big-time famous.

309
00:22:53,673 --> 00:22:55,072
You really never heard of him?

310
00:22:55,074 --> 00:22:58,542
I heard he was a leader
in this gang mess, girl.

311
00:22:58,544 --> 00:23:01,145
Whoa, miss Helen, now, they
don't say "gang" anymore.

312
00:23:01,147 --> 00:23:02,847
They say "organization."

313
00:23:02,849 --> 00:23:04,548
What is his real name?

314
00:23:04,550 --> 00:23:06,650
His government name?

315
00:23:06,652 --> 00:23:08,519
Nah.

316
00:23:10,455 --> 00:23:11,655
Demetrius.

317
00:23:13,525 --> 00:23:14,959
Demetrius Dupree.

318
00:23:14,961 --> 00:23:19,463
Demetrius Dupree. His father?

319
00:23:19,465 --> 00:23:22,933
All chi's told me
is that he died in prison.

320
00:23:31,543 --> 00:23:34,145
He's got a good heart
deep down inside.

321
00:23:34,147 --> 00:23:35,846
I love him.

322
00:23:37,883 --> 00:23:39,483
I can change chi.

323
00:23:39,485 --> 00:23:41,552
Darling,

324
00:23:41,554 --> 00:23:44,655
people change when
they decide to change.

325
00:23:44,657 --> 00:23:46,157
You make it sound so easy.

326
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,560
All you can do is create
an environment for change.

327
00:23:49,562 --> 00:23:52,463
Like an alcoholic,
you take away his booze.

328
00:23:52,465 --> 00:23:54,799
You just try
taking away their guns.

329
00:23:54,801 --> 00:23:57,201
All right, well,
what else do they love?

330
00:23:57,203 --> 00:24:01,572
Uh... getting turnt up,
making money.

331
00:24:01,574 --> 00:24:03,207
What else?

332
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:05,743
Um...

333
00:24:07,680 --> 00:24:09,146
Yeah, well.

334
00:24:09,148 --> 00:24:10,481
Mm-hmm.

335
00:24:10,483 --> 00:24:11,482
Pick up your phone.

336
00:24:12,784 --> 00:24:13,284
Google.

337
00:24:19,592 --> 00:24:21,926

What's up, girlfriend?

355
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,401
You unhappy staying
at miss Helen's crib?

356
00:27:17,403 --> 00:27:19,069
You know how old people live.

357
00:27:19,071 --> 00:27:21,772
That ain't the thing, Rasheeda.

358
00:27:21,774 --> 00:27:24,108
- I'm on fire.
- Burn, baby, burn.

359
00:27:24,110 --> 00:27:27,945
We agreed to hook up,
make this plan.

360
00:27:27,947 --> 00:27:30,280
Where the females at, huh?

361
00:27:30,282 --> 00:27:32,116
Laid up with some man.

362
00:27:35,286 --> 00:27:38,722
- Oh, no.
<i>- Hell, no.</i>

363
00:27:38,724 --> 00:27:40,791
Hell, no!

364
00:27:40,793 --> 00:27:43,861
- Marcy! Tee-tee!
- It was today?

365
00:27:43,863 --> 00:27:45,362
Damn right it was today.

366
00:27:45,364 --> 00:27:47,431
You know I was waiting
on a line from Jackson.

367
00:27:47,433 --> 00:27:49,800
He's in Afghan seeing action.

368
00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:51,335
Waiting on his call,
I went to the mall.

369
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:53,871
Little man wanted
some cap'n crunch.

370
00:27:53,873 --> 00:27:55,673
He eat it for breakfast,
maybe lunch.

371
00:27:55,675 --> 00:27:57,941
Get in the damn car.
Sorry, Eddie.

372
00:28:04,416 --> 00:28:07,151
- Whose crib this be?
- Indigo.

373
00:28:07,153 --> 00:28:08,452
Indigo?

374
00:28:08,454 --> 00:28:10,721
Isn't that cyclops's
main squeeze?

375
00:28:10,723 --> 00:28:12,990
Cyclops' bae?

376
00:28:12,992 --> 00:28:14,458
Yo, I got on purple.

377
00:28:14,460 --> 00:28:16,827
She a woman,
we all black women.

378
00:28:16,829 --> 00:28:18,462
That's the matter
at hand, sista.

379
00:28:18,464 --> 00:28:20,464
Yeah, yeah, I can dig
your sista app,

380
00:28:20,466 --> 00:28:22,700
but make sure
they don't bust no caps.

381
00:28:22,702 --> 00:28:25,402
- Can I help you?
<i>- 'Sup, indigo?</i>

382
00:28:25,404 --> 00:28:26,837
You covergirl clean.

383
00:28:26,839 --> 00:28:29,440
That figure
brick shithouse mean!

384
00:28:29,442 --> 00:28:32,443
Mm-hmm, this about who
set your house on fire?

385
00:28:32,445 --> 00:28:35,212
- What y'all tired strags want?
- Man, what y'all want?

386
00:28:35,214 --> 00:28:37,281
Hey, man, chill with that shrill
before I whup your butt, slut!

387
00:28:37,283 --> 00:28:39,750
Yo!

388
00:28:39,752 --> 00:28:41,218
I got a kid with me,
y'all. Relax.

389
00:28:41,220 --> 00:28:43,153
- Peace! Peace and hair grease!
- Calm down.

390
00:28:43,155 --> 00:28:44,722
- Check your girl!
- Check her!

391
00:28:44,724 --> 00:28:47,124
Check the ignorance.

392
00:28:47,126 --> 00:28:49,827
- We all sistas here.
- Bitch, I ain't your sista.

393
00:28:49,829 --> 00:28:53,097
This my running partner Dania and
my Ace boon coon hecuba. - What?

394
00:28:53,099 --> 00:28:55,032
- And I know you know Kenya the rapper.
<i>- Nah.</i>

395
00:28:55,034 --> 00:28:57,235
I ain't putting out fear, so
what y'all trying to steer?

396
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:04,308
God forbid cyclops find y'all
spartan tricks up in here.

397
00:29:04,310 --> 00:29:07,144
Everybody here got a man in
the orange and purple colors,

398
00:29:07,146 --> 00:29:09,046
banging and slanging,
fighting for the flag,

399
00:29:09,048 --> 00:29:11,448
risking that long zip
of the cadaver bag.

400
00:29:11,450 --> 00:29:14,051
- It's how we live.
- It's how we die.

401
00:29:14,053 --> 00:29:16,053
You wanna lose
your man to a drive-by?

402
00:29:16,055 --> 00:29:18,155
<i>In a pine box 'fore he's 25?</i>

403
00:29:18,157 --> 00:29:20,891
- I lost my cousin.
- And I lost my little brother.

404
00:29:20,893 --> 00:29:22,226
I lost my nephew.

405
00:29:22,228 --> 00:29:24,228
My uncle got killed
two weeks ago,

406
00:29:24,230 --> 00:29:26,830
and like always,
nobody saw nothing.

407
00:29:26,832 --> 00:29:28,198
All to the bang-bang.

408
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:29,933
Bang, bang.

409
00:29:29,935 --> 00:29:32,236
We've all lost people, too,
many a sister and brother.

410
00:29:32,238 --> 00:29:34,104
Now, I'd like to see
cyclops and chi

411
00:29:34,106 --> 00:29:36,406
put down that mess between
the trojans and the greeks,

412
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:37,941
but that day looks bleak.

413
00:29:37,943 --> 00:29:39,409
What if we could
devise a method

414
00:29:39,411 --> 00:29:40,844
to end the bloodshed?

415
00:29:40,846 --> 00:29:42,813
Yo, count on me.
You need money?

416
00:29:42,815 --> 00:29:44,248
I'll pawn all the gold
around my neck,

417
00:29:44,250 --> 00:29:45,949
then get turnt up
till I'm a wreck.

418
00:29:45,951 --> 00:29:47,084
Hey!

419
00:29:47,086 --> 00:29:48,418
I am ready to split myself

420
00:29:48,420 --> 00:29:50,120
up the middle, give you half.

421
00:29:50,122 --> 00:29:52,189
I'm down for the cause, but how?

422
00:29:52,191 --> 00:29:55,425
We force our men
to negotiate peace

423
00:29:55,427 --> 00:29:58,262
by exercising
cocksure self-control

424
00:29:58,264 --> 00:30:01,365
and total abstinence
from knocking the boots.

425
00:30:06,372 --> 00:30:08,906
I never did like y'all trojan
chickenheads any goddamn way...

426
00:30:08,908 --> 00:30:10,307
- oh, no!
- Yeah, you heard me!

427
00:30:10,309 --> 00:30:12,409
- Get up out of here.
- Y'all kicking us out?

428
00:30:12,411 --> 00:30:13,977
Get out of here. Shoot 'em up.

429
00:30:13,979 --> 00:30:15,112
Bang, bang.

430
00:30:15,114 --> 00:30:17,014
Please, please, just sit down.

431
00:30:17,016 --> 00:30:19,249
We ain't gonna be that long.
Rasheeda, shut the fuck up.

432
00:30:19,251 --> 00:30:20,250
Give me one more minute.

433
00:30:20,252 --> 00:30:21,985
Hey, I got my son with me.

434
00:30:21,987 --> 00:30:23,120
I gotta go.

435
00:30:23,122 --> 00:30:26,123
Marcy, this has to do
with your son.

436
00:30:26,125 --> 00:30:27,324
Just a minute ago,
you was ready

437
00:30:27,326 --> 00:30:30,294
to split yourself
up the middle.

438
00:30:30,296 --> 00:30:32,529
Go ahead, so y'all spartans
can get out of here.

439
00:30:32,531 --> 00:30:36,600
I just saw a mother
weeping in the streets,

440
00:30:36,602 --> 00:30:39,236
her baby's blood spilt.

441
00:30:43,141 --> 00:30:45,576
Man, you really think something
like that could bring peace?

442
00:30:45,578 --> 00:30:47,477
Y'all know the power
we have over them

443
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:50,314
withholding just a day.

444
00:30:50,316 --> 00:30:51,982
- A week?
- You're right.

445
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:53,951
- Ooh.
- Imagine a month.

446
00:30:53,953 --> 00:30:56,153
A year!

447
00:30:56,155 --> 00:30:58,322
Oh, they gonna bring the peace!

448
00:30:58,324 --> 00:31:01,558
Suppose... suppose
that the men just dump us.

449
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:04,228
If we all hold out,
who can they go to?

450
00:31:04,230 --> 00:31:05,462
The thots.

451
00:31:05,464 --> 00:31:07,064
Them hos over there!

452
00:31:07,066 --> 00:31:09,299
Well, we will enlist them, too.

453
00:31:09,301 --> 00:31:10,500
If we want our men alive,

454
00:31:10,502 --> 00:31:12,002
we want our babies to thrive,

455
00:31:12,004 --> 00:31:13,871
we gonna have to organize.

456
00:31:16,107 --> 00:31:18,075
Repeat after me.

457
00:31:19,611 --> 00:31:23,113
I will deny all rights

458
00:31:23,115 --> 00:31:26,884
of access or entrance...

459
00:31:26,886 --> 00:31:30,654
I will deny all rights

460
00:31:30,656 --> 00:31:33,924
of access or entrance...

461
00:31:33,926 --> 00:31:36,026
from every husband,

462
00:31:36,028 --> 00:31:39,229
lover, or male acquaintance...

463
00:31:39,231 --> 00:31:41,431
From every husband,

464
00:31:41,433 --> 00:31:45,102
lover, or male acquaintance...

465
00:31:45,104 --> 00:31:48,405
who comes to my
direction in erection.

466
00:31:50,142 --> 00:31:54,511
Who comes to my
direction in erection.

467
00:31:54,513 --> 00:31:56,380
Uh, come on. Say it!

468
00:31:56,382 --> 00:31:57,681
- Come on.
- Girl, I can't...

469
00:31:59,551 --> 00:32:01,551
- I can't do this. No!
- Come on!

470
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:06,390
If he should force me to lay
on that conjugal couch...

471
00:32:06,392 --> 00:32:11,395
If he should force me to
lay on that conjugal couch...

472
00:32:11,397 --> 00:32:14,231
I will refuse his stroke

473
00:32:14,233 --> 00:32:17,134
and not give up
that nappy pouch.

474
00:32:17,136 --> 00:32:20,704
I will refuse his stroke

475
00:32:20,706 --> 00:32:23,674
and not give up
that nappy pouch.

476
00:32:23,676 --> 00:32:25,542
No peace?

477
00:32:25,544 --> 00:32:28,145
No pussy!

478
00:32:29,280 --> 00:32:30,714
Ah!

479
00:32:30,716 --> 00:32:33,083
The red wine has been drunk.

480
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:35,252
The plan is now struck.

481
00:32:35,254 --> 00:32:38,088
Dolmedes must tell you fellas,

482
00:32:38,090 --> 00:32:40,090
y'all about to get punked.

483
00:32:40,092 --> 00:32:43,660
Lysistrata had them all
take a solemn oath.

484
00:32:43,662 --> 00:32:45,595
Stop the murder madness

485
00:32:45,597 --> 00:32:47,731
or there would be
no more pokes.

486
00:32:47,733 --> 00:32:51,068
Some even thought
the shit was a hoax.

487
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:55,105
How could them females give up the
long dick and the downstroke?

488
00:32:55,107 --> 00:32:57,441
This must be some bullshit!

489
00:32:57,443 --> 00:32:59,276
Ain't no fucking way!

490
00:32:59,278 --> 00:33:01,611
But y'all about to find out

491
00:33:01,613 --> 00:33:04,114
these gals don't play.

492
00:33:04,116 --> 00:33:06,116
No more poonani, nookie-pie,

493
00:33:06,118 --> 00:33:07,751
beehive, or honeybun.

494
00:33:07,753 --> 00:33:10,220
No coochie, no nappy dugout.

495
00:33:10,222 --> 00:33:12,756
That's right. You gets none.

496
00:33:12,758 --> 00:33:15,325
Say what?

497
00:33:15,327 --> 00:33:16,460
<i>To be so damn smart,</i>

498
00:33:16,462 --> 00:33:18,061
you know
you're tweaking, right?

499
00:33:18,063 --> 00:33:19,296
You lame as hell,
playing games for real

500
00:33:19,298 --> 00:33:20,697
<i>with this wack-ass</i>
<i>panty strike,</i>

501
00:33:20,699 --> 00:33:22,332
and that's that shit
we don't like.

502
00:33:22,334 --> 00:33:24,167
You wanna choose to be rude?

503
00:33:24,169 --> 00:33:25,702
Bitches gonna be tight when
you make 'em lose they dudes.

504
00:33:25,704 --> 00:33:27,537
I don't know who you think
you're trying to change.

505
00:33:27,539 --> 00:33:29,039
I'm trojan through and through.

506
00:33:29,041 --> 00:33:30,441
That's stronger
than any damn screw.

507
00:33:30,442 --> 00:33:31,742
It's even bigger than you.

508
00:33:31,744 --> 00:33:35,479
All you care about
is this tired gangsta game.

509
00:33:35,481 --> 00:33:37,147
Well, it's lame!

510
00:33:37,149 --> 00:33:38,749
You think you'll die with fame?

511
00:33:38,751 --> 00:33:40,217
Negro, two days later,

512
00:33:40,219 --> 00:33:42,586
no one will even
remember your name.

513
00:33:42,588 --> 00:33:44,588
Your machismo
is really masochism.

514
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,256
That's why
I'm cutting off your jism.

515
00:33:46,258 --> 00:33:48,658
As long as you love
the life more than a wife,

516
00:33:48,660 --> 00:33:49,760
we strike.

517
00:33:51,796 --> 00:33:53,363
Why you so frigid?

518
00:33:53,365 --> 00:33:54,398
Why don't you let me
thaw you out

519
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,066
with this ice pick?

520
00:33:56,068 --> 00:33:58,301
You know you can't resist
a chocolate lick.

521
00:33:58,303 --> 00:33:59,569
Chill out.

522
00:33:59,571 --> 00:34:01,338
Your next move
is your best move,

523
00:34:01,340 --> 00:34:03,673
and it gonna be smoo...

524
00:34:03,675 --> 00:34:06,076
fine. Remember that
little kiddie rhyme.

525
00:34:06,078 --> 00:34:08,078
369, indigo drank wine.

526
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,780
Made the chicks walk
that no sex line.

527
00:34:09,782 --> 00:34:12,049
But the line broke,
and them bitches choked.

528
00:34:12,051 --> 00:34:14,351
AndLysistrata
and her former friends

529
00:34:14,353 --> 00:34:16,386
got replaced
by some tighter pokes.

530
00:34:24,762 --> 00:34:25,829
Bye.

531
00:34:25,831 --> 00:34:27,831
- Be...
- Safe!

532
00:34:35,741 --> 00:34:37,407
What's happening with
the jump-off, Bacchos?

533
00:34:37,409 --> 00:34:39,176
We got the cheese.
Where the nachos?

534
00:34:39,178 --> 00:34:41,111
Spartans trying to have
the club on lock, yo!

535
00:34:41,113 --> 00:34:42,479
It's rough out here!

536
00:34:42,481 --> 00:34:43,814
It's Saturday night.
We getting tight?

537
00:34:43,816 --> 00:34:45,382
Not tonight.

538
00:34:45,384 --> 00:34:48,218
Ain't no partying,
no dancing, no getting down.

539
00:34:48,220 --> 00:34:50,387
- Why?
- Ain't a broad to be had.

540
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:53,390
Just a bunch of
hardheads going stag.

541
00:34:53,392 --> 00:34:55,525
It's the same all over town.

542
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:57,394
Clubs is closing down.

543
00:34:57,396 --> 00:34:59,629
Man, these womens
have vanished.

544
00:34:59,631 --> 00:35:02,232
Even the hos is no-shows.

545
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:04,367
What the fuck is this, though?

546
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,671
What the hell?

547
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:12,876
I'll be goddamned.

548
00:35:12,878 --> 00:35:14,845
What the...

549
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:19,383
shee...

550
00:35:23,589 --> 00:35:24,089
Eee...

551
00:35:27,593 --> 00:35:30,560
Eee... it.

552
00:35:32,764 --> 00:35:33,897
<i>All right, peep this.</i>

553
00:35:33,899 --> 00:35:35,765
I got 30 girls
stripping for me,

554
00:35:35,767 --> 00:35:37,901
another five on loan,
and not one of them,

555
00:35:37,903 --> 00:35:41,171
not one of them is answering
their goddamn phone.

556
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:42,572
This shit is wack.

557
00:35:42,574 --> 00:35:43,807
Yeah, I mean,
at this time of the night,

558
00:35:43,809 --> 00:35:45,909
the champagne room
would be full of life.

559
00:35:45,911 --> 00:35:48,445
Young boys putting dollar bills

560
00:35:48,447 --> 00:35:50,814
in the drawers
of all my pretty thrills.

561
00:35:50,816 --> 00:35:54,284
Cyclops, we have
been struck by a plague

562
00:35:54,286 --> 00:35:57,721
that will put that biblical
pestilence shit to shame.

563
00:35:57,723 --> 00:35:59,923
And this famine only affects
the lower regions

564
00:35:59,925 --> 00:36:02,559
where all you young trojans
do most of your thinking.

565
00:36:02,561 --> 00:36:04,461
I mean, this is the male
side of the aisle.

566
00:36:04,463 --> 00:36:07,464
If you can't squeeze it,
you at least wanna...

567
00:36:07,466 --> 00:36:10,433
wanna... you know, tease it.

568
00:36:14,205 --> 00:36:17,607
Oh, but... but...
but these hos have literally

569
00:36:17,609 --> 00:36:19,442
<i>shut down the penis power grid.</i>

570
00:36:19,444 --> 00:36:21,745
So my question to y'all

571
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:24,347
is what you
motherfuckers done did?

572
00:36:24,349 --> 00:36:25,682
<i>Huh?</i>

573
00:36:25,684 --> 00:36:27,484
<i>The situation's out of control,</i>

574
00:36:27,486 --> 00:36:29,553
'cause I'm in front
of an empty stripper pole!

575
00:36:29,555 --> 00:36:33,456
But you still got soul, so you
know your pole is... is gold.

576
00:36:38,262 --> 00:36:40,897
Cyclops. Cyclops,
keep your eye on me.

577
00:36:40,899 --> 00:36:42,966
Yo, we got you, Morris.
Don't worry about this, man.

578
00:36:42,968 --> 00:36:45,835
I got this.
Know what I'm saying?

579
00:36:45,837 --> 00:36:48,238
I got it between
my crosshairs, nah?

580
00:36:48,240 --> 00:36:50,340
What you need is another eye.

581
00:36:50,342 --> 00:36:52,209
There's not even
half an ass to look at.

582
00:36:52,211 --> 00:36:53,977
One of these days,
man, you know,

583
00:36:53,979 --> 00:36:55,812
you're gonna get tired of
them one-eye jokes and shit.

584
00:36:55,814 --> 00:36:57,847
Sorry, man,
I'm a little uptight

585
00:36:57,849 --> 00:36:59,649
because there ain't no pussy
in the club tonight.

586
00:36:59,651 --> 00:37:00,817
Where's yours on standby?

587
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:02,519
I can't sell standby.

588
00:37:02,521 --> 00:37:05,956
I need some active duty,
first-class, "va-Gina."

589
00:37:05,958 --> 00:37:08,525
You need active duty... Booty?

590
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:13,363
Active duty... Booty.

591
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:15,365
I'm glad you can find
humor in this.

592
00:37:15,367 --> 00:37:17,300
Sometimes that shit just come to me.
I don't even know how, man.

593
00:37:17,302 --> 00:37:18,735
You know what, man?

594
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:20,937
I would like to have somebody
on that pole tonight.

595
00:37:20,939 --> 00:37:23,907
Beast, pole, baby.

596
00:37:23,909 --> 00:37:25,275
It's not that kind
of club, young man.

597
00:37:25,277 --> 00:37:26,776
Hey, man, go and get
on the pole.

598
00:37:26,778 --> 00:37:28,878
What kind of insubordination
is this shit?

599
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,947
- Oh, no, we got it, boss.
- <i> You need all you can get, mo!</i>

600
00:37:30,949 --> 00:37:32,983
- Relax, I got this.
- <i> Get yours, son.</i>

601
00:37:32,985 --> 00:37:35,552
- <i> Yeah, do that shit.</i>
- <i> Do that spin, do that spin.</i>

602
00:37:35,554 --> 00:37:36,953
- Whoo!
- <i> Yeah, that's right.</i>

603
00:37:36,955 --> 00:37:37,873
- <i> Yeah!</i>
- <i> Oh.</i>

604
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,924
Hey, yo, big Thelma,
where you going?

605
00:37:40,926 --> 00:37:42,525
The us Virgin Islands,

606
00:37:42,527 --> 00:37:44,027
a place my girls
ain't never seen.

607
00:37:44,029 --> 00:37:45,562
Well, where your girls be at?

608
00:37:45,564 --> 00:37:47,030
My bitches told me to go,

609
00:37:47,032 --> 00:37:48,732
say they're honoring
the strike.

610
00:37:48,734 --> 00:37:50,033
Say they don't care who likes.

611
00:37:50,035 --> 00:37:51,901
- A ho strike?
- Shit, yeah.

612
00:37:51,903 --> 00:37:53,737
Good thing I'm a dyke.

613
00:37:53,739 --> 00:37:54,838
Can you believe this shit?

614
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:26,890
Yeah!

615
00:40:29,094 --> 00:40:30,760
Glory!

616
00:40:30,762 --> 00:40:32,729
We don't mourn
like other people!

617
00:40:34,099 --> 00:40:37,600
Praise him! Praise him!

618
00:40:37,602 --> 00:40:38,635
Can I get a "glory"?

619
00:40:38,637 --> 00:40:40,069
Glory!

620
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:43,139
- Can I get an "amen"?
- Amen!

621
00:40:51,749 --> 00:40:53,883
I'm gonna talk
about a life today.

622
00:40:56,086 --> 00:40:59,222
An important life...

623
00:40:59,224 --> 00:41:00,790
In our community.

624
00:41:04,028 --> 00:41:05,962
A life...

625
00:41:08,766 --> 00:41:10,099
That ends life.

626
00:41:13,537 --> 00:41:16,005
The life...

627
00:41:16,007 --> 00:41:17,974
Of a gun.

628
00:41:17,976 --> 00:41:21,144
<i>- Ah, yeah.</i>
<i>- Oh, mercy! Mercy.</i>

629
00:41:24,782 --> 00:41:27,817
- Oh.
- That's right!

630
00:41:27,819 --> 00:41:31,788
This gun began
its professional career

631
00:41:31,790 --> 00:41:36,192
when it was purchased
by tiny Tony from Chicago

632
00:41:36,194 --> 00:41:39,696
at an Indiana gun show

633
00:41:39,698 --> 00:41:42,532
using a fake Indiana ID

634
00:41:42,534 --> 00:41:46,236
and bypassed all
of our strict gun laws.

635
00:41:50,641 --> 00:41:52,976
Chicago gangs

636
00:41:52,978 --> 00:41:56,813
buy the guns for big money...

637
00:41:59,918 --> 00:42:01,284
<i>Break it down.</i>

638
00:42:01,286 --> 00:42:03,653
- For their work...
- <i> Mm-hmm.</i>

639
00:42:03,655 --> 00:42:05,655
In the underground economy.

640
00:42:05,657 --> 00:42:07,824
Tell the truth!

641
00:42:07,826 --> 00:42:09,158
That's right.

642
00:42:09,160 --> 00:42:11,995
The underground economy exists

643
00:42:11,997 --> 00:42:15,999
because banks
and lending institutions

644
00:42:16,001 --> 00:42:18,201
rarely loan money
to poor people.

645
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:19,269
Is that right?

646
00:42:19,271 --> 00:42:22,839
Right. Say it!

647
00:42:22,841 --> 00:42:26,209
Their children, however,
admire the thug life.

648
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:32,682
But they do so from the
safety of suburban Chicago!

649
00:42:32,684 --> 00:42:36,185
- That's right!
- Kenilworth, Wilmette, highland park.

650
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:37,687
No, no, no, no.

651
00:42:37,689 --> 00:42:40,723
This gun wouldn't be
caught dead there.

652
00:42:40,725 --> 00:42:43,326
This gun is
the principal player

653
00:42:43,328 --> 00:42:45,862
in a reality TV
urban murder show

654
00:42:45,864 --> 00:42:49,299
that can be seen every
night at 5:00 and 10:00,

655
00:42:49,301 --> 00:42:54,137
every channel, on any news
show you wanna watch.

656
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:56,839
And that's when this gun...

657
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:02,679
Met our child Patti.

658
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:07,317
- <i> Patti.</i>
<i>- Yeah! Yeah!</i>

659
00:43:10,721 --> 00:43:11,921
Patti is gone...

660
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:19,729
Because our politicians
are in the pocket

661
00:43:19,731 --> 00:43:23,366
of the national
rifle association!

662
00:43:23,368 --> 00:43:27,236
They have become
their mouthpieces

663
00:43:27,238 --> 00:43:30,974
or silent co-conspirators!

664
00:43:30,976 --> 00:43:34,777
Patti is gone...

665
00:43:34,779 --> 00:43:39,115
Because of an economy
that has abandoned the poor.

666
00:43:39,117 --> 00:43:42,352
Downtown they say
unemployment is 5.7%.

667
00:43:43,921 --> 00:43:45,321
How's that sound?

668
00:43:45,323 --> 00:43:47,056
<i>Right here in auburn gresham,</i>

669
00:43:47,058 --> 00:43:49,092
unemployment is 21%!

670
00:43:49,094 --> 00:43:52,395
And that doesn't even count
people who have given up hope

671
00:43:52,397 --> 00:43:54,797
and stopped looking for work.

672
00:43:54,799 --> 00:43:58,868
The per capita income
is $12,000!

673
00:43:58,870 --> 00:44:03,272
42% of us live
below the poverty line.

674
00:44:03,274 --> 00:44:06,042
30% don't have
a high school diploma.

675
00:44:06,044 --> 00:44:08,344
What America
are they living in?

676
00:44:08,346 --> 00:44:10,680
Yes!

677
00:44:10,682 --> 00:44:13,716
We go from third-rate schools

678
00:44:13,718 --> 00:44:17,086
to first-class
high-tech prisons.

679
00:44:19,357 --> 00:44:23,926
Mass incarceration
is the new Jim crow!

680
00:44:27,998 --> 00:44:31,434
Our Patti is gone

681
00:44:31,436 --> 00:44:35,772
because gang members
are more concerned

682
00:44:35,774 --> 00:44:38,307
with popping pills
and popping bottles,

683
00:44:38,309 --> 00:44:40,443
more concerned
with what's on YouTube!

684
00:44:40,445 --> 00:44:42,145
<i>Say it, father Mike!</i>

685
00:44:42,147 --> 00:44:47,283
More concerned with ego,
street cred, and greed

686
00:44:47,285 --> 00:44:48,885
than a human life.

687
00:44:51,321 --> 00:44:53,756
Patti's gone because
guns have become

688
00:44:53,758 --> 00:44:55,825
a part of America's wardrobe.

689
00:44:55,827 --> 00:44:57,326
<i>Preach, father Mike!</i>

690
00:44:57,328 --> 00:45:01,297
Where it is easier
to get a gun than a computer.

691
00:45:05,169 --> 00:45:09,839
Sirens and gunshots

692
00:45:09,841 --> 00:45:11,808
are our soundtrack.

693
00:45:15,179 --> 00:45:18,347
Yellow police tape,
Teddy bears,

694
00:45:18,349 --> 00:45:20,249
t-shirts, balloons...

695
00:45:20,251 --> 00:45:23,319
these are the national memorials
of our neighborhoods.

696
00:45:30,160 --> 00:45:31,828
And it doesn't look good.

697
00:45:36,033 --> 00:45:37,300
<i>Take your time!</i>

698
00:45:41,172 --> 00:45:43,239
<i>Preach!</i>

699
00:45:43,241 --> 00:45:45,174
It didn't look good...

700
00:45:47,778 --> 00:45:50,813
When the sky turned dark

701
00:45:50,815 --> 00:45:53,449
and the sun refused to shine

702
00:45:53,451 --> 00:45:57,053
and the earth began to quake

703
00:45:57,055 --> 00:45:59,388
and they laid
Jesus's lifeless body

704
00:45:59,390 --> 00:46:00,990
<i>at the arms of mother Mary!</i>

705
00:46:00,992 --> 00:46:02,992
<i>Yeah! Preach!</i>

706
00:46:02,994 --> 00:46:05,828
And I don't need to go
back to biblical times!

707
00:46:05,830 --> 00:46:08,231
It didn't look good
in a Birmingham church

708
00:46:08,233 --> 00:46:10,900
when four little girls
were blown apart by hate!

709
00:46:10,902 --> 00:46:12,902
It didn't look good
when Medgar was laying

710
00:46:12,904 --> 00:46:15,037
bleeding to death
in his driveway.

711
00:46:15,039 --> 00:46:18,908
It didn't look good when Malcolm was
shot down on the audubon stage!

712
00:46:18,910 --> 00:46:21,210
And it didn't look good
when Martin Luther King

713
00:46:21,212 --> 00:46:23,513
stood on the balcony
of the Lorraine motel

714
00:46:23,515 --> 00:46:26,082
outside room 306

715
00:46:26,084 --> 00:46:29,185
and at 6:03 was taken from us!

716
00:46:29,187 --> 00:46:32,789
And, no, it doesn't look good!

717
00:46:32,791 --> 00:46:36,092
Not when Patti was lost
on a busy street

718
00:46:36,094 --> 00:46:38,094
with folks going
to work and school,

719
00:46:38,096 --> 00:46:40,096
with cars passing by!

720
00:46:40,098 --> 00:46:41,564
How is it possible?

721
00:46:41,566 --> 00:46:43,266
How is it possible

722
00:46:43,268 --> 00:46:45,401
that not one witness
has come forward?

723
00:46:47,371 --> 00:46:48,871
Not one!

724
00:46:48,873 --> 00:46:52,275
How is it possible
that no one has the courage

725
00:46:52,277 --> 00:46:54,443
and the conscience
to speak up for this family!

726
00:46:54,445 --> 00:46:56,279
Somebody knows!

727
00:46:56,281 --> 00:46:57,947
Somebody, help me!

728
00:46:57,949 --> 00:46:59,415
Somebody!

729
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:02,919
<i>Somebody knows!</i>

730
00:47:02,921 --> 00:47:06,389
Cynics say, "well, if I
snitch, I'll be killed, too."

731
00:47:06,391 --> 00:47:09,091
First of all,
when a murderer walks free,

732
00:47:09,093 --> 00:47:10,560
we are all in danger!

733
00:47:10,562 --> 00:47:13,296
But if multiple folks
come forward,

734
00:47:13,298 --> 00:47:15,464
multiple folks
who witnessed these murders,

735
00:47:15,466 --> 00:47:17,366
there is no one target!

736
00:47:17,368 --> 00:47:20,369
What makes someone a target
is not the shooter.

737
00:47:20,371 --> 00:47:21,838
<i>That's right!</i>

738
00:47:21,840 --> 00:47:25,141
What makes someone a target
is the community

739
00:47:25,143 --> 00:47:28,144
that surrenders to fear...

740
00:47:28,146 --> 00:47:29,979
<i>Yes!</i>

741
00:47:29,981 --> 00:47:32,481
And becomes silent.

742
00:47:32,483 --> 00:47:35,618
That's why we at St. Sabina

743
00:47:35,620 --> 00:47:38,621
must put out a $5,000 reward

744
00:47:38,623 --> 00:47:41,624
for information
leading to the arrest

745
00:47:41,626 --> 00:47:44,527
of Patti's killer
or any killer!

746
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:47,964
Because we need to say
loud and clear,

747
00:47:47,966 --> 00:47:49,966
"you cannot murder
our children!"

748
00:47:49,968 --> 00:47:52,001
You cannot murder our children,

749
00:47:52,003 --> 00:47:55,171
then go back to the crib,
turn on "sportscenter,"

750
00:47:55,173 --> 00:47:59,008
eat a whopper and fries, and act
like nothing ever happened.

751
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:02,612
We will not allow this
self-inflicted genocide to continue.

752
00:48:02,614 --> 00:48:06,282
We will not allow this
self-inflicted genocide to continue.

753
00:48:06,284 --> 00:48:09,018
This is a disgrace!
This is a disgrace!

754
00:48:09,020 --> 00:48:11,554
Patti lives! Patti lives!

755
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:14,290
And Patti will have justice!

756
00:48:14,292 --> 00:48:16,659
- Do you have faith?
- Yes!

757
00:48:16,661 --> 00:48:19,028
- Do you want justice?
- Yes!

758
00:48:19,030 --> 00:48:21,197
Are you willing
to get up and walk?

759
00:48:21,199 --> 00:48:23,165
- Yes!
- Get up!

760
00:48:23,167 --> 00:48:25,434
Hope wins!

761
00:48:25,436 --> 00:48:27,470
Peace wins!

762
00:48:27,472 --> 00:48:29,372
- Goodness...
- Wins!

763
00:48:29,374 --> 00:48:31,574
- Righteousness...
- Wins!

764
00:48:31,576 --> 00:48:33,476
- Love!
- Wins!

765
00:48:33,478 --> 00:48:35,611
- Love!
- Wins!

766
00:48:35,613 --> 00:48:38,214
- Love!
- Wins!

767
00:48:38,216 --> 00:48:42,084
<i>All right, father Mike!</i>

768
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,206
What up, what up?

769
00:50:51,182 --> 00:50:53,682
Man, you got a lot of stuff
out here on this table.

770
00:50:53,684 --> 00:50:55,384
You got everything going,
don't you?

771
00:50:55,386 --> 00:50:57,053
Pssh.

772
00:50:57,055 --> 00:51:01,357
Man, you got the Lane
and you're blowing?

773
00:51:01,359 --> 00:51:03,359
That's too much, man.

774
00:51:03,361 --> 00:51:07,763
Yeah, just trying to keep
my mind off that bullshit.

775
00:51:07,765 --> 00:51:11,367
<i>Man, I don't want you
to be fucked up like me, man.</i>

776
00:51:11,369 --> 00:51:13,436
<i>Walk around being in a chair.</i>

777
00:51:13,438 --> 00:51:15,271
<i>Can't move your legs.</i>

778
00:51:15,273 --> 00:51:18,207
<i>Got to wear a motherfucking
undergarment.</i>

779
00:51:18,209 --> 00:51:22,278
<i>Fucking shitting and pissing
on yourself for nothing.</i>

780
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:25,314
Got to put
these damn braces on,

781
00:51:25,316 --> 00:51:27,850
these motherfuckers, every day.

782
00:51:27,852 --> 00:51:30,486
These are reminders.
And for what?

783
00:51:30,488 --> 00:51:32,421
If I wanna throw the "s" up?

784
00:51:34,558 --> 00:51:37,760
Man, you gotta...
we gotta wake up, man.

785
00:51:37,762 --> 00:51:39,295
<i>Look at me, man.</i>

786
00:51:39,297 --> 00:51:40,763
<i>Fucking tired</i>
<i>of this shit, man.</i>

787
00:51:40,765 --> 00:51:42,398
<i>Gave my whole life</i>
<i>to this shit,</i>

788
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,233
<i>and I ain't got</i>
<i>nothing in return.</i>

789
00:51:44,235 --> 00:51:47,403
This shit here,
this trojan-spartan shit,

790
00:51:47,405 --> 00:51:50,372
man, we gotta... we gotta
slow this shit down, man.

791
00:51:50,374 --> 00:51:53,576
My son got shot.
He in a wheelchair now.

792
00:51:53,578 --> 00:51:55,878
Quadriplegic.

793
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:58,280
Cat just stood over him,
capped him.

794
00:51:58,282 --> 00:52:00,416
14 times.

795
00:52:00,418 --> 00:52:02,284
For what?

796
00:52:02,286 --> 00:52:06,388
Man, this ain't living.
This ain't life.

797
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:08,724
Chi, we gotta do
something different, bro.

798
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:12,428
We gotta do
something different.

799
00:52:12,430 --> 00:52:14,430
I don't wake up
every day to get high,

800
00:52:14,432 --> 00:52:17,266
to cry, go to funerals.

801
00:52:17,268 --> 00:52:19,168
Ain't you tired
of this shit, man?

802
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,241
I mean, don't you wanna
do something different?

803
00:53:11,488 --> 00:53:14,657
At first, I thought
you were all insane.

804
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:17,793
But on further review,

805
00:53:17,795 --> 00:53:20,696
as a man who's taken
a vow of celibacy,

806
00:53:20,698 --> 00:53:22,798
I know the power
of the sexual appetite.

807
00:53:22,800 --> 00:53:24,633
I know this fruit is ripe.

808
00:53:24,635 --> 00:53:27,369
But understand, your ruse
won't bring a truce.

809
00:53:27,371 --> 00:53:28,771
Well, what will bring peace?

810
00:53:28,773 --> 00:53:31,674
How about a job?
Affordable housing.

811
00:53:31,676 --> 00:53:33,976
A good education.
Purpose, hope.

812
00:53:33,978 --> 00:53:35,678
There's a lot
of hate out there.

813
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,247
A lot of self-hate.
A lot of racial hate.

814
00:53:38,249 --> 00:53:39,682
That Charleston massacre?

815
00:53:39,684 --> 00:53:40,983
Murdered at a prayer meeting.

816
00:53:40,985 --> 00:53:42,952
- Hate crimes.
- Assassinations.

817
00:53:42,954 --> 00:53:44,353
Domestic terrorists.

818
00:53:44,355 --> 00:53:45,854
South Kakalaki.

819
00:53:45,856 --> 00:53:48,357
First to secede,
last to concede.

820
00:53:48,359 --> 00:53:51,293
They built the citadel
to take on mother Emanuel.

821
00:53:51,295 --> 00:53:53,395
It's the oldest
ame church in the south,

822
00:53:53,397 --> 00:53:55,998
founded by
Denmark Vesey in 1822.

823
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:58,534
Their heritage is white
supremacy, through and through.

824
00:53:58,536 --> 00:54:00,903
That evil young klansman
Dylann storm roof?

825
00:54:01,973 --> 00:54:03,005
He's the proof.

826
00:54:03,007 --> 00:54:04,540
Post-racial... poof.

827
00:54:04,542 --> 00:54:06,308
Storm wants his country back.

828
00:54:06,310 --> 00:54:08,444
- Storm ain't getting it.
- It ain't his!

829
00:54:08,446 --> 00:54:10,312
Storm is from a way of hate,

830
00:54:10,314 --> 00:54:11,780
and we may not
be able to relate.

831
00:54:11,782 --> 00:54:15,017
Those murders came from
a lower Carolina state.

832
00:54:15,019 --> 00:54:18,754
Historically speaking,
evil's in that boy's blood.

833
00:54:18,756 --> 00:54:21,023
Well, now, the brothas
on the block?

834
00:54:21,025 --> 00:54:23,759
They do the white man's
murderous bidding for him.

835
00:54:23,761 --> 00:54:26,395
Now, that form of hate,
we can't translate.

836
00:54:26,397 --> 00:54:27,730
It enunciates.

837
00:54:27,732 --> 00:54:32,368
But I will exterminate
myself, my kind, me!

838
00:54:32,370 --> 00:54:34,003
Us.

839
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:37,740
The question remains.

840
00:54:37,742 --> 00:54:40,476
Can your plan save us from us?

841
00:54:46,750 --> 00:54:48,584
Company, halt!

842
00:54:48,586 --> 00:54:50,486
- About face!
- Ain't that your boy?

843
00:54:50,488 --> 00:54:52,821
<i>General king Kong?</i>

844
00:54:52,823 --> 00:54:54,423
He wishes.

845
00:54:54,425 --> 00:54:56,358
That's why I quit.

846
00:54:56,360 --> 00:54:58,927
<i>You know, John
brown raided an armory</i>

847
00:54:58,929 --> 00:55:02,031
<i>at Harper's ferry</i>
<i>when he freed the slaves.</i>

848
00:55:02,033 --> 00:55:04,533
Show me what you're made of.
Right here, right now!

849
00:55:04,535 --> 00:55:05,934
Assume the position!

850
00:55:21,084 --> 00:55:22,751
General king Kong?

851
00:55:24,621 --> 00:55:25,921
I wan to enlist.

852
00:55:27,957 --> 00:55:29,625
Young lady,

853
00:55:29,627 --> 00:55:32,394
speak to one of our
recruiting sergeants.

854
00:55:32,396 --> 00:55:34,963
No, general!

855
00:55:34,965 --> 00:55:39,635
My bestie Rasheeda,
she served under you.

856
00:55:39,637 --> 00:55:43,706
She told me, "get behind
that general king Kong."

857
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:46,342
Said you's
a commanding officer.

858
00:55:48,378 --> 00:55:51,113
Young lady...

859
00:55:51,115 --> 00:55:53,449
May I speak to you in private?

860
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:06,428
<i>Dick, h.W.,</i>

861
00:56:06,430 --> 00:56:08,497
<i>rice-a-roni, w.,</i>

862
00:56:08,499 --> 00:56:09,732
<i>rummy.</i>

863
00:56:09,734 --> 00:56:11,834
No Clinton?

864
00:56:11,836 --> 00:56:14,837
Where's president
Hussein Obama?

865
00:56:14,839 --> 00:56:17,139
I'd rather have an African
lion in the white house,

866
00:56:17,141 --> 00:56:18,774
than a lyin' African.

867
00:56:20,845 --> 00:56:23,779
You're too funny, general.

868
00:56:23,781 --> 00:56:26,949
Young lady, I'm about
to show you something

869
00:56:26,951 --> 00:56:29,852
few people have seen.

870
00:56:29,854 --> 00:56:32,755
This is one of the most important
artifacts of the civil war,

871
00:56:32,757 --> 00:56:35,524
affectionately known
as whistling dick

872
00:56:35,526 --> 00:56:37,159
because of the
terrifying sound it made

873
00:56:37,161 --> 00:56:40,162
when it went off
and wreaked its deadly havoc.

874
00:56:40,164 --> 00:56:43,165
Saved our rebs
time and time again.

875
00:56:43,167 --> 00:56:47,035
What do you call this, general?

876
00:56:47,037 --> 00:56:48,871
The rammer.

877
00:56:48,873 --> 00:56:51,874
Let me show you how it works.

878
00:56:51,876 --> 00:56:52,908
Oh! Oh!

879
00:56:52,910 --> 00:56:56,044
Shove it in the hole like so.

880
00:56:56,046 --> 00:56:58,969
Push it down real low,
as far as it will go.

881
00:56:58,995 --> 00:56:59,748
Uh-huh.

882
00:56:59,750 --> 00:57:03,118
And you pull it out real slow.

883
00:57:04,921 --> 00:57:07,022
Look at you, general!

884
00:57:08,725 --> 00:57:10,025
Oh!

885
00:57:11,194 --> 00:57:12,194
Oh!

886
00:57:12,196 --> 00:57:14,029
I'm always prepared.

887
00:57:14,031 --> 00:57:16,098
Sucky sucky now.

888
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:19,902
Oh, you know what would get
me really alabamy hot?

889
00:57:19,904 --> 00:57:21,437
What? What? Tell me.

890
00:57:21,439 --> 00:57:22,738
- Hand to hand?
- Oh, no.

891
00:57:22,740 --> 00:57:26,642
Watch you mount
old whistling dick.

892
00:57:26,644 --> 00:57:28,911
- Ride it?
- Oh, yeah.

893
00:57:28,913 --> 00:57:32,214
Yeah, like you old
general stonewall Jackson

894
00:57:32,216 --> 00:57:35,517
coming to rescue little old
darkie me from those Yankees.

895
00:57:35,519 --> 00:57:37,786
- It would turn you on?
- Yeah.

896
00:57:37,788 --> 00:57:40,055
I'm not just whistling Dixie.

897
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:43,759
Oh! Whoo!

898
00:57:43,761 --> 00:57:45,894
Here we go! Come on!

899
00:57:45,896 --> 00:57:47,629
- Ride it.
- Yeah.

900
00:57:47,631 --> 00:57:50,165
- Ride it. You like that?
- Yeah, come on.

901
00:57:50,167 --> 00:57:51,166
Yeah!

902
00:57:51,168 --> 00:57:53,469
Let that pretty black steel

903
00:57:53,471 --> 00:57:56,238
ride up your pretty pelvis.

904
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,474
Son of a bitch, this is good.

905
00:57:58,476 --> 00:58:00,809
This is good. Yeah!

906
00:58:00,811 --> 00:58:03,712
- You like that?
- Now come here, you black stallion.

907
00:58:03,714 --> 00:58:05,581
It's time to light this Cannon.

908
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:07,883
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
One more thing.

909
00:58:07,885 --> 00:58:09,785
What?

910
00:58:09,787 --> 00:58:11,987
Now this right here, general,

911
00:58:11,989 --> 00:58:14,223
this'll really turn me on.

912
00:58:16,259 --> 00:58:19,661
But I'm blind.

913
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:21,864
- I'm blind.
- Yes, you are.

914
00:58:21,866 --> 00:58:24,132
Here, now give me those hands.

915
00:58:24,134 --> 00:58:26,168
You want my fingertips?

916
00:58:26,170 --> 00:58:27,803
What you gonna do with them?

917
00:58:27,805 --> 00:58:30,138
I want all of you.
Oh, you like that?

918
00:58:30,140 --> 00:58:32,140
Yeah, that's so sweet.

919
00:58:32,142 --> 00:58:35,077
- Sweetie, come on.
- Feel that?

920
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:37,613
Now you mine now, general.

921
00:58:37,615 --> 00:58:39,281
Yeah, here we go.

922
00:58:39,283 --> 00:58:41,517
Yeah!

923
00:58:43,052 --> 00:58:44,653
I'm your whistling dick.

924
00:58:44,655 --> 00:58:46,288
I'm your little whistling dick.

925
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:48,090
<i>Whistle.</i>

926
00:58:48,092 --> 00:58:51,527
<i>Whistle like you want it, baby.</i>

927
00:58:51,529 --> 00:58:54,162
Now come here, you little
nappy-headed ho.

928
00:58:54,164 --> 00:58:56,031
Come on, mama.

929
00:58:56,033 --> 00:58:58,800
Bring it, my little burr head.

930
00:58:58,802 --> 00:59:00,202
Come on.

931
00:59:00,204 --> 00:59:02,104
Here we go.

932
00:59:06,209 --> 00:59:08,076
Wait a minute.

933
00:59:09,546 --> 00:59:13,148
What in tarnation is this?

934
00:59:13,150 --> 00:59:15,918
This is an act of treason.

935
00:59:18,155 --> 00:59:20,656
You a black nigra Isis.

936
00:59:51,588 --> 00:59:53,655
Come on! Come on!

937
00:59:53,657 --> 00:59:56,124
Move it! Move it! Move it!
Move it! Move it!

938
00:59:57,226 --> 00:59:59,261
- Go! Go!
- Freeze!

939
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:02,230
Don't shoot! Don't shoot!

940
01:00:02,232 --> 01:00:04,833
Please, don't shoot.
Don't shoot!

941
01:00:04,835 --> 01:00:07,903
Move! Move!

942
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:22,951
Is this the police
or seal team two?

943
01:00:22,953 --> 01:00:24,853
And you're surprised
there's derision?

944
01:00:24,855 --> 01:00:27,189
If this was your neighborhood,
what would you do?

945
01:00:27,191 --> 01:00:28,890
Look at all this weaponry.

946
01:00:28,892 --> 01:00:31,727
Shit look like an invasion,
not a persuasion.

947
01:00:31,729 --> 01:00:34,062
All this for some
unarmed women of color?

948
01:00:34,064 --> 01:00:36,965
I think something got lost
in translation.

949
01:00:36,967 --> 01:00:39,668
They say they come
to protect and serve,

950
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:42,170
but the real truth is
they get the chance,

951
01:00:42,172 --> 01:00:45,407
they treat these girls like
Eric garner selling loosies.

952
01:00:45,409 --> 01:00:47,909
Let's get truthy.

953
01:00:47,911 --> 01:00:50,278
Cops and gangs,

954
01:00:50,280 --> 01:00:53,115
black and brown folks
stuck in the middle.

955
01:00:53,117 --> 01:00:54,883
Shit's on fire, y'all.

956
01:00:54,885 --> 01:00:56,818
I can hear Nero's fiddle.

957
01:00:56,820 --> 01:00:59,054
Can't trust the police.

958
01:00:59,056 --> 01:01:01,289
Afraid of the gangs.

959
01:01:01,291 --> 01:01:05,794
This whole motherfucking
thing is insane.

960
01:01:05,796 --> 01:01:08,163
What happened to the
officer on the beat?

961
01:01:08,165 --> 01:01:11,833
And this banger sure ain't
mama Nem's little treat.

962
01:01:15,905 --> 01:01:17,906
<i>First I wanna
thank you all for showing up.</i>

963
01:01:17,908 --> 01:01:20,342
<i>We all know that enough</i>
<i>is enough and too much stinks,</i>

964
01:01:20,344 --> 01:01:23,712
<i>so we need to come together</i>
<i>in agreement about this oath.</i>

965
01:01:23,714 --> 01:01:25,414
<i>What oath?</i>

966
01:01:25,416 --> 01:01:28,417
<i>Swearing off
the one-eyed monster.</i>

967
01:01:28,419 --> 01:01:29,951
What?

968
01:01:29,953 --> 01:01:32,354
Miss Helen, as an attorney,
I know the trip.

969
01:01:32,356 --> 01:01:35,223
I convict our youngsters
to this new slave ship.

970
01:01:35,225 --> 01:01:38,393
If I do take the oath, how
will it sink that bloody boat?

971
01:01:38,395 --> 01:01:40,262
Althea, it won't work.

972
01:01:40,264 --> 01:01:43,065
You just like having your man
by the Jackie Robinsons.

973
01:01:43,067 --> 01:01:46,968
Right, and that's why
sugar pie man don't stray.

974
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:49,104
I keeps that bone dry

975
01:01:49,106 --> 01:01:51,907
and also keep myself
looking fly.

976
01:01:51,909 --> 01:01:55,277
Oh, so that's why you wear
them too-tight numbers

977
01:01:55,279 --> 01:01:57,879
and fishnets or Daisy Dukes.

978
01:01:57,881 --> 01:02:01,383
Big old ripple up ass
hanging all out the shoot.

979
01:02:01,385 --> 01:02:03,952
Oh, y'all wanna laugh?

980
01:02:03,954 --> 01:02:06,254
It's funny? Little broke ass
destiny's child over here.

981
01:02:06,256 --> 01:02:08,957
You wanna laugh? Don't
talk about my big ass.

982
01:02:08,959 --> 01:02:11,960
We all got some bumps and bruises
and cigarette burns on asses.

983
01:02:11,962 --> 01:02:14,229
- Speak for yourself.
- What about you and your man?

984
01:02:14,231 --> 01:02:16,264
Old Duke wanna hit
that big butt,

985
01:02:16,266 --> 01:02:17,432
you ain't gonna give it up?

986
01:02:17,434 --> 01:02:19,334
Ole Duke and me is separated.

987
01:02:19,336 --> 01:02:22,037
Girl, please.
You still wanna hit that.

988
01:02:22,039 --> 01:02:23,905
Even if I did, which I don't,

989
01:02:23,907 --> 01:02:25,941
I will not violate the oath.

990
01:02:25,943 --> 01:02:28,977
Now, sisters, come on.
This isn't a joke.

991
01:02:28,979 --> 01:02:31,847
We all have a stake in this fray.
You know mine.

992
01:02:31,849 --> 01:02:34,015
So forget about
your personal needs.

993
01:02:34,017 --> 01:02:37,185
I'll be damned
if another child bleeds.

994
01:02:37,187 --> 01:02:41,123
Oh, Dr. miss aesop
has the floor.

995
01:02:41,125 --> 01:02:43,792
A woman wise beyond her years.

996
01:02:43,794 --> 01:02:47,028
Maybe she can help us
dry this river of tears.

997
01:02:47,030 --> 01:02:52,167
As a pediatrician for 50 years,

998
01:02:52,169 --> 01:02:55,370
I was dedicated
to preserving life.

999
01:02:55,372 --> 01:02:59,407
God, nature, the higher power

1000
01:02:59,409 --> 01:03:01,510
put more nerves
in a man's thing

1001
01:03:01,512 --> 01:03:04,146
than he ever did in his brain.

1002
01:03:04,148 --> 01:03:08,517
Thus, the women
must save the babies.

1003
01:03:10,419 --> 01:03:12,287
Save the babies.

1004
01:03:12,289 --> 01:03:16,958
It's time to get that gate
of motherhood locked up.

1005
01:03:16,960 --> 01:03:18,260
- Lock it up.
- Lock it up.

1006
01:03:18,262 --> 01:03:19,861
- Lock it up.
- Lock it up.

1007
01:03:19,863 --> 01:03:21,396
- Lock it up.
- Lock it up.

1008
01:03:21,398 --> 01:03:23,999
- Lock it up! Lock it up!
- Hold up, hold up.

1009
01:03:24,001 --> 01:03:26,201
Hold the fuck up!

1010
01:03:26,203 --> 01:03:29,938
If I lose my man, I'm
gonna cut all of y'all.

1011
01:03:29,940 --> 01:03:31,940
Shit!

1012
01:03:31,942 --> 01:03:33,875
Fuck it.

1013
01:03:33,877 --> 01:03:35,410
Lock it up.

1014
01:03:35,412 --> 01:03:38,847
Knights of euphrates,
these females

1015
01:03:38,849 --> 01:03:40,882
think this is gonna
stop the gangs.

1016
01:03:40,884 --> 01:03:43,552
Ain't this a blip? Silly
rabbits on a stone-cold trip.

1017
01:03:43,554 --> 01:03:46,922
I told sugar pie
before I left the house,

1018
01:03:46,924 --> 01:03:49,891
Apollo ain't no goddamn mouse.

1019
01:03:49,893 --> 01:03:51,326
She don't want to give it up,

1020
01:03:51,328 --> 01:03:54,396
I'll find me some
brand-new fresh ass butt.

1021
01:03:54,398 --> 01:03:56,231
There's too much ass
for all that trash.

1022
01:03:58,368 --> 01:04:00,001
Hey, ain't y'all heard?

1023
01:04:00,003 --> 01:04:02,337
The phone sex women,
they honoring the strike.

1024
01:04:02,339 --> 01:04:04,940
And the porno
all closing the nookie.

1025
01:04:04,942 --> 01:04:06,541
I mean, not even
a fucking lookie.

1026
01:04:06,543 --> 01:04:09,511
Fellas, they shutting it all
down tighter than fish pussy.

1027
01:04:09,513 --> 01:04:11,213
And you know that shit
is waterproof.

1028
01:04:11,215 --> 01:04:13,014
Waterproof. Tight, tight.

1029
01:04:13,016 --> 01:04:14,616
What you gotta say, oedipus?

1030
01:04:14,618 --> 01:04:16,551
Well, I asked
my mommy last night

1031
01:04:16,553 --> 01:04:18,453
and she said
the women are right.

1032
01:04:18,455 --> 01:04:20,322
- Your mommy?
- Yes.

1033
01:04:20,324 --> 01:04:23,058
Skinny nigga, sometimes I think
you married to your damn mommy.

1034
01:04:23,060 --> 01:04:25,560
Well, I love my mother
and my mommy loves me.

1035
01:04:25,562 --> 01:04:29,631
Gentlemen, I am proud to say that I was
breast-fed till I was 12 years old.

1036
01:04:31,301 --> 01:04:33,134
Tmi.

1037
01:04:33,136 --> 01:04:35,136
<i>I hear some straight</i>
<i>dude's been making</i>

1038
01:04:35,138 --> 01:04:38,139
late-night appearances on "queer
sex for the straight guy."

1039
01:04:38,141 --> 01:04:40,075
Yeah, and the brothers
on the down low,

1040
01:04:40,077 --> 01:04:42,077
even they saying no blow.

1041
01:04:42,079 --> 01:04:44,012
Nigga, what did you say?

1042
01:04:44,014 --> 01:04:45,347
How I know that, I don't know.

1043
01:04:45,349 --> 01:04:48,583
Well, at my age,
I thought my missus

1044
01:04:48,585 --> 01:04:50,285
was just a pest.

1045
01:04:50,287 --> 01:04:54,222
But lord have mercy,
she's a sexual terrorist.

1046
01:04:54,224 --> 01:04:56,024
And who do we have to blame?

1047
01:04:56,026 --> 01:04:57,425
- Oprah?
- Women's lib?

1048
01:04:57,427 --> 01:04:59,261
Uppity ass women!

1049
01:04:59,263 --> 01:05:01,263
Let's give them frails

1050
01:05:01,265 --> 01:05:03,098
a dose of they own damn tail.

1051
01:05:03,100 --> 01:05:05,000
We'll let them
twilly tarts know

1052
01:05:05,002 --> 01:05:07,535
who makes them groan
and moan and hoot.

1053
01:05:07,537 --> 01:05:09,004
And bring home the damn loot.

1054
01:05:09,006 --> 01:05:10,472
So what we gonna do, ole Duke?

1055
01:05:10,474 --> 01:05:12,240
We took those flags once.

1056
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:13,608
We can take 'em again.

1057
01:05:13,610 --> 01:05:16,511
Poindexter's old, unh,
but he can still go.

1058
01:05:16,513 --> 01:05:19,047
- You saying do it ourselves?
- That's the plan, Stan.

1059
01:05:19,049 --> 01:05:21,683
Unless you always wanna have
that in your greasy old hand.

1060
01:05:21,685 --> 01:05:23,285
Knights of euphrates, rise up.

1061
01:05:26,055 --> 01:05:27,622
Like the battles of the past,

1062
01:05:27,624 --> 01:05:31,092
we shall come together
to whup some female ass.

1063
01:05:31,094 --> 01:05:33,161
Let us not stand
for their flapping lips

1064
01:05:33,163 --> 01:05:35,330
nor their chronic
nagging bullshit.

1065
01:05:35,332 --> 01:05:37,299
- Are we mice or men?
- Men!

1066
01:05:37,301 --> 01:05:39,534
We shall redeem
the power of our breed

1067
01:05:39,536 --> 01:05:43,104
with one mighty thrust into the
misty mist and the dusky dusky.

1068
01:05:43,106 --> 01:05:46,041
- What makes a muskrat guard his musk?
- Courage!

1069
01:05:46,043 --> 01:05:48,476
- What makes the sphinx the seventh wonder?
- Courage!

1070
01:05:48,478 --> 01:05:51,212
- What makes the dawn come up like thunder?
- Courage!

1071
01:05:51,214 --> 01:05:53,315
What makes Venus
hottentot so hot?

1072
01:05:53,317 --> 01:05:55,617
What puts the dance
in the robot?

1073
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:57,485
What we got
that they ain't got?

1074
01:05:58,521 --> 01:05:59,688
Courage?

1075
01:05:59,690 --> 01:06:02,090
Fuck, no. A dick. Blue balls.

1076
01:06:04,394 --> 01:06:07,495
Miss Helen, I see you out
here with all these ladies today.

1077
01:06:07,497 --> 01:06:09,164
What do you hope to accomplish?

1078
01:06:09,166 --> 01:06:11,299
Lysistrata's platform coincides

1079
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:14,402
with the mayor's 10-point
plan to end gun violence.

1080
01:06:14,404 --> 01:06:16,604
Her demands are our demands.

1081
01:06:16,606 --> 01:06:19,074
Why do you think
your demands and your plan

1082
01:06:19,076 --> 01:06:20,608
will work better than what
the mayor has put forward?

1083
01:06:20,610 --> 01:06:23,378
Because we have one, and
it's to save our children.

1084
01:06:23,380 --> 01:06:25,981
We need to stop this
violence in the street.

1085
01:06:25,983 --> 01:06:29,150
He's distracted. He has many
things that he's concerned about.

1086
01:06:29,152 --> 01:06:31,052
We are concerned
about our babies

1087
01:06:31,054 --> 01:06:34,389
and we are talking to our men
in our homes in the bedroom.

1088
01:06:34,391 --> 01:06:35,757
I think they'll listen then.

1089
01:06:35,759 --> 01:06:37,225
I ain't in no gang.

1090
01:06:37,227 --> 01:06:39,260
You telling me you gonna
stop giving my girl

1091
01:06:39,262 --> 01:06:41,463
from giving me what I need
because your man

1092
01:06:41,465 --> 01:06:44,232
is the leader of the gang and he
out there shooting and killing?

1093
01:06:44,234 --> 01:06:44,926
Don't make sense.

1094
01:06:44,952 --> 01:06:47,369
I don't understand that. I
ain't a part of that party.

1095
01:06:47,371 --> 01:06:49,671
I'm old enough to know that I'm
supposed to do what I'm supposed to do.

1096
01:06:49,673 --> 01:06:52,007
She old enough to know she's supposed
to do what she's supposed to do.

1097
01:06:52,009 --> 01:06:53,775
Now, them young kids, they the
ones out here tripping like that.

1098
01:06:53,777 --> 01:06:56,077
No peace, no pussy.

1099
01:06:56,079 --> 01:06:57,746
Women, you need us.

1100
01:06:57,748 --> 01:06:59,681
Do your duty
and drop that Booty.

1101
01:06:59,683 --> 01:07:03,585
No peace, no pussy.
Negotiate and copulate.

1102
01:07:03,587 --> 01:07:05,420
Women, you need us.

1103
01:07:05,422 --> 01:07:07,222
Do your duty
and drop that Booty.

1104
01:07:07,224 --> 01:07:11,426
No peace, no pussy.
Negotiate and copulate.

1105
01:07:11,428 --> 01:07:15,030
Women, you need us. Do your
duty and drop that Booty.

1106
01:07:15,032 --> 01:07:19,034
No peace, no pussy.
Negotiate and copulate.

1107
01:07:19,036 --> 01:07:21,202
That's where they are.

1108
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:24,072
We can bring a team here

1109
01:07:24,074 --> 01:07:27,242
all the way across
by the main underneath

1110
01:07:27,244 --> 01:07:29,144
and surprise them.

1111
01:07:29,146 --> 01:07:30,712
I wonder who sent him.

1112
01:07:30,714 --> 01:07:32,781
So what is this, chief?

1113
01:07:32,783 --> 01:07:35,483
At approximately 1500 hours,

1114
01:07:35,485 --> 01:07:38,319
75 women took possession
of the armory.

1115
01:07:38,321 --> 01:07:40,789
They had hostages,
they released them.

1116
01:07:40,791 --> 01:07:42,690
- Women did this?
- Black and brown women.

1117
01:07:42,692 --> 01:07:45,493
- Black and brown women?
- Just black and brown women.

1118
01:07:45,495 --> 01:07:46,694
- How many dead?
- Zero.

1119
01:07:46,696 --> 01:07:48,129
- Just wounded?
- Nada.

1120
01:07:48,131 --> 01:07:49,431
They packing
some big muscle, huh?

1121
01:07:49,433 --> 01:07:51,099
No, sir, they appear
to be unarmed.

1122
01:07:51,101 --> 01:07:53,134
- How many?
- Approximately 75, sir.

1123
01:07:53,136 --> 01:07:57,372
Are you telling me
that 75 black and brown women

1124
01:07:57,374 --> 01:08:01,276
took a United States
military armory unarmed?

1125
01:08:01,278 --> 01:08:03,178
Yes, sir.

1126
01:08:03,180 --> 01:08:06,114
"No peace, no pussy."

1127
01:08:06,116 --> 01:08:08,450
What the hell
is going on, riptide?

1128
01:08:11,354 --> 01:08:14,522
Don't let that foolishness
outside scare you.

1129
01:08:14,524 --> 01:08:18,493
The armory
is our chastity belt.

1130
01:08:18,495 --> 01:08:21,563
I will deny all rights

1131
01:08:21,565 --> 01:08:23,631
of access or entrance...

1132
01:08:23,633 --> 01:08:28,870
I will deny all rights
of access or entrance...

1133
01:08:28,872 --> 01:08:32,807
to every husband, lover,
or male acquaintance...

1134
01:08:32,809 --> 01:08:36,711
To every husband,
lover, or male acquaintance...

1135
01:08:36,713 --> 01:08:39,747
who comes to my direction
in erection.

1136
01:08:39,749 --> 01:08:42,717
Who comes to my
direction in erection.

1137
01:08:42,719 --> 01:08:46,721
If he should force me to lay
on that conjugal couch...

1138
01:08:46,723 --> 01:08:50,358
If he should force me to
lay on that conjugal couch...

1139
01:08:50,360 --> 01:08:52,393
I will refuse his stroke

1140
01:08:52,395 --> 01:08:54,496
and not give up
that nappy pouch.

1141
01:08:54,498 --> 01:08:56,598
I will refuse his stroke

1142
01:08:56,600 --> 01:08:58,500
and not give up
that nappy pouch.

1143
01:08:58,502 --> 01:09:01,870
I will not lift my house shoes
to touch thy thatch...

1144
01:09:01,872 --> 01:09:05,306
I will not lift my house
shoes to touch thy thatch...

1145
01:09:05,308 --> 01:09:08,843
or submit hangdog
and part with the snatch.

1146
01:09:08,845 --> 01:09:12,313
Or submit hangdog
and part with the snatch.

1147
01:09:12,315 --> 01:09:14,149
No peace, no pussy.

1148
01:09:14,151 --> 01:09:15,917
No peace, no pussy.

1149
01:09:15,919 --> 01:09:17,919
- Lock it up!
- Lock it up!

1150
01:09:17,921 --> 01:09:19,787
Lock it up! Lock it up!

1151
01:09:19,789 --> 01:09:22,423
Lock it up! Lock it up!
Lock it up!

1152
01:09:22,425 --> 01:09:24,926
Hello?

1153
01:09:24,928 --> 01:09:26,694
<i>Jesus h. Christ.</i>

1154
01:09:26,696 --> 01:09:28,530
- <i> Mr. mayor.</i>
- Hang on.

1155
01:09:28,532 --> 01:09:30,932
Everybody out there in the
world, take this, too.

1156
01:09:30,934 --> 01:09:32,734
You're part of this.
Take this vow.

1157
01:09:32,736 --> 01:09:36,337
Did you know this woman
used to work for my office?

1158
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:37,572
No, I didn't know that,
your honor.

1159
01:09:37,574 --> 01:09:39,207
It's your job to know!

1160
01:09:39,209 --> 01:09:40,775
She was a secretary.

1161
01:09:40,777 --> 01:09:42,610
But she's not typing
letters anymore.

1162
01:09:42,612 --> 01:09:44,946
Oh, no, she's getting
the other secretaries

1163
01:09:44,948 --> 01:09:48,183
to walk off the job.
She's leading a revolt.

1164
01:09:48,185 --> 01:09:50,718
I could lose the female vote
over this stupid joke.

1165
01:09:50,720 --> 01:09:52,720
<i>Jesus, you know how I feel</i>
<i>about this baloney.</i>

1166
01:09:52,722 --> 01:09:55,256
<i>I can't afford</i>
<i>to look like a phony.</i>

1167
01:09:55,258 --> 01:09:56,858
Damned if I do,
damned if I don't.

1168
01:09:56,860 --> 01:09:58,893
Either way, I'm gonna
have a friggin' stroke.

1169
01:09:58,895 --> 01:10:01,229
- Let's see how serious they are.
- <i> What's your meaning?</i>

1170
01:10:01,231 --> 01:10:03,498
- Perhaps we should let them get the feeling.
- <i> The feeling?</i>

1171
01:10:03,500 --> 01:10:05,867
Instead of us breaking in,
we close them off.

1172
01:10:05,869 --> 01:10:07,669
Build a perimeter,
a wall around them.

1173
01:10:07,671 --> 01:10:09,904
- Wall?
- <i> Operation hot and bothered.</i>

1174
01:10:09,906 --> 01:10:12,207
<i>Your honor, we surround</i>
<i>the armory with speakers</i>

1175
01:10:12,209 --> 01:10:14,642
<i>blasting one of those romantic</i>
<i>slow jams from the '70s.</i>

1176
01:10:14,644 --> 01:10:17,946
Those crooning brothers will make those
mommies wet and make them wanna jet.

1177
01:10:17,948 --> 01:10:21,816
<i>Those chastity belters will end their
sex strike and climb mount pike.</i>

1178
01:10:21,818 --> 01:10:23,785
We run the ball
right down their throats.

1179
01:10:23,787 --> 01:10:26,821
With total male pride, mayor, you
win this with their appetite.

1180
01:10:26,823 --> 01:10:28,289
You never have to say
you were right.

1181
01:10:28,291 --> 01:10:30,425
You never attack
or call them weak.

1182
01:10:30,427 --> 01:10:33,361
- And you always seek the peace.
- You're a deviant bastard.

1183
01:10:33,363 --> 01:10:35,530
That's why I went into
public service, your honor.

1184
01:10:35,532 --> 01:10:39,000
Touchdown, bears! Rah!

1185
01:10:39,002 --> 01:10:40,602
Love you.

1186
01:10:40,604 --> 01:10:43,838
No peace, no pussy!
No peace, no pussy!

1187
01:10:43,840 --> 01:10:45,640
No peace, no pussy!

1188
01:11:03,926 --> 01:11:09,030
Lysistrata! Lysistrata!
Lysistrata! Lysistrata!

1189
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:17,805
Hello. Hi. Good afternoon.

1190
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:21,609
Excuse me. Would you happen
to be Ms. Clara worthy?

1191
01:11:21,611 --> 01:11:24,746
No, sir. And who might you be?

1192
01:11:24,748 --> 01:11:27,348
I am Mr. Morrowburns.

1193
01:11:27,350 --> 01:11:28,616
How might I help you, sir?

1194
01:11:28,618 --> 01:11:31,552
Ms. Clara worthy,
is she around?

1195
01:11:31,554 --> 01:11:35,023
Is this the right address?
6328 Elizabeth Avenue, right?

1196
01:11:35,025 --> 01:11:37,792
- Yes, it is.
- Do you know Ms. Clara worthy?

1197
01:11:37,794 --> 01:11:40,361
Well, I better.
Clara's my younger sister.

1198
01:11:40,363 --> 01:11:41,629
I'm Ms. Helen worthy.

1199
01:11:41,631 --> 01:11:43,564
Wonderful. Pleased to meet you.

1200
01:11:43,566 --> 01:11:45,500
I love your garden.
It's very beautiful.

1201
01:11:45,502 --> 01:11:47,702
- Well, thank you.
- Is your sister here?

1202
01:11:47,704 --> 01:11:49,871
No, sir. You just missed her.

1203
01:11:49,873 --> 01:11:52,807
Clara's going on up to Jackson,
Mississippi, to visit our parents.

1204
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:55,443
- You're kidding.
- <i> Yeah, she left last night.</i>

1205
01:11:55,445 --> 01:11:57,378
- I have cousins in Jackson.
- Do you?

1206
01:11:57,380 --> 01:11:58,946
<i>I do. We might be kin.</i>

1207
01:11:58,948 --> 01:12:02,016
- Might could be.
- Might could be.

1208
01:12:02,018 --> 01:12:04,852
Listen, could you give your
sister a message for me, please?

1209
01:12:04,854 --> 01:12:07,021
Well, that's gonna
depend on the message.

1210
01:12:07,023 --> 01:12:08,323
Right.

1211
01:12:08,325 --> 01:12:10,425
Oh.

1212
01:12:12,061 --> 01:12:15,463
Oh, red, white, and blue
insurance company.

1213
01:12:15,465 --> 01:12:17,832
We got word in the home
office that your sister

1214
01:12:17,834 --> 01:12:21,903
has a young son, a teenager
by the name of homer worthy.

1215
01:12:21,905 --> 01:12:26,574
<i>I came to tell your sister that
she really should consider</i>

1216
01:12:26,576 --> 01:12:29,811
<i>taking out a life
insurance policy on homer</i>

1217
01:12:29,813 --> 01:12:34,415
<i>because I'm sure you know that
young black boys on the south side</i>

1218
01:12:34,417 --> 01:12:38,619
are more than likely
to be shot and/or killed.

1219
01:12:38,621 --> 01:12:41,989
<i>And so the red, white,</i>
<i>and blue insurance company</i>

1220
01:12:41,991 --> 01:12:46,561
is hoping to help
single mothers

1221
01:12:46,563 --> 01:12:49,731
like your sister
in case of a tragedy

1222
01:12:49,733 --> 01:12:53,067
<i>because, of course, it's always
better to be safe than to be sorry.</i>

1223
01:12:53,069 --> 01:12:56,504
- Mr. Burnsmorrow... whatever your name is.
- <i> Morrowburns.</i>

1224
01:12:56,506 --> 01:12:59,006
If you don't leave here
right now right this second,

1225
01:12:59,008 --> 01:13:02,143
you're gonna need a goddamn
insurance policy your goddamn self

1226
01:13:02,145 --> 01:13:04,979

with this here bullshit!

1227
01:13:06,582 --> 01:13:08,916
Leave!

1228
01:13:08,918 --> 01:13:12,487
- Leave!
- It's Morrowburns.

1229
01:13:12,489 --> 01:13:14,522
Do you think I give
a flying fuck

1230
01:13:14,524 --> 01:13:16,924
about your fucked-up name?

1231
01:13:16,926 --> 01:13:18,993
Get on off the street, man.

1232
01:13:18,995 --> 01:13:20,461
Have a nice day, ma'am.

1233
01:13:20,463 --> 01:13:22,697
Go on back up to the big house

1234
01:13:22,699 --> 01:13:24,732
- and you tell them it didn't work.
- Have a nice day, ma'am.

1235
01:13:24,734 --> 01:13:27,935
Out here trying to take advantage
of your own goddamn people.

1236
01:14:12,515 --> 01:14:15,183
Come on, ladies.
You got children.

1237
01:14:21,591 --> 01:14:24,091
If y'all have any
information, let us know.

1238
01:14:49,151 --> 01:14:52,253
Save our babies!
Save our babies!

1239
01:14:52,255 --> 01:14:55,590
Save our babies!
Save our babies!

1240
01:14:55,592 --> 01:14:58,092
Back up, sucka.
Don't give us no smack.

1241
01:14:58,094 --> 01:15:00,928
Or we'll beat you to death with
Pampers, Gerbers and Similac.

1242
01:15:00,930 --> 01:15:02,897
Talk that talk,
but you're gonna jail.

1243
01:15:02,899 --> 01:15:04,532
And don't even think
about bail.

1244
01:15:04,534 --> 01:15:06,133
Who do you think
you are, Rosa parks?

1245
01:15:06,135 --> 01:15:07,535
What a damn farce.

1246
01:15:07,537 --> 01:15:09,570
Yo, we in a hurry

1247
01:15:09,572 --> 01:15:11,939
like a ferguson
or staten island jury.

1248
01:15:11,941 --> 01:15:13,708
Those judgments were fair.

1249
01:15:13,710 --> 01:15:15,977
Look, y'all, nobody cares.

1250
01:15:15,979 --> 01:15:18,579
Trayvon Martin. Mike brown.

1251
01:15:18,581 --> 01:15:20,281
Tamir rice. Walter Scott.

1252
01:15:20,283 --> 01:15:22,250
Rekia Boyd and Freddie gray.

1253
01:15:22,252 --> 01:15:24,619
Black lives matter every day.

1254
01:15:24,621 --> 01:15:27,255
Not just when you
trigger-happy cops go astray.

1255
01:15:27,257 --> 01:15:30,124
<i>Dude, you think sister
Sandra bland hung herself?</i>

1256
01:15:30,126 --> 01:15:32,026
You kill us with impunity.

1257
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:33,694
You give them the opportunity.

1258
01:15:33,696 --> 01:15:35,596
'Cause we kill
each other like flies,

1259
01:15:35,598 --> 01:15:37,698
you rogue cops
think you can capitalize.

1260
01:15:37,700 --> 01:15:40,535
You thugs don't care about
each other, why should we?

1261
01:15:40,537 --> 01:15:43,671
Thugs? Who the fuck
you calling a thug?

1262
01:15:43,673 --> 01:15:46,073
Because we are we.

1263
01:15:46,075 --> 01:15:49,977
No matter what our problems
are, we deserve respect.

1264
01:15:49,979 --> 01:15:52,313
Even though our lives
ain't perfect,

1265
01:15:52,315 --> 01:15:54,715
we deserve respect.

1266
01:15:54,717 --> 01:15:56,951
Even though we live
in terror town,

1267
01:15:56,953 --> 01:15:58,786
- we deserve...
- Respect!

1268
01:15:58,788 --> 01:16:00,721
And if you
don't understand that,

1269
01:16:00,723 --> 01:16:03,090
then, brother, step back.

1270
01:16:03,092 --> 01:16:06,727
<i>You and your</i>
<i>Dr. Ben Carson lot.</i>

1271
01:16:08,264 --> 01:16:11,232
<i>Yeah, I'll kill that for you.</i>

1272
01:16:11,234 --> 01:16:13,568
I'm a killer.
Killing that pussy, huh?

1273
01:16:13,570 --> 01:16:15,603
- Huh? Huh?
- Oh, chi-raq!

1274
01:16:15,605 --> 01:16:17,138
I'm a killer?

1275
01:16:17,140 --> 01:16:19,040
- Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!
- Huh? Yeah, come!

1276
01:16:22,277 --> 01:16:25,146
How'd you learn
to make love so good?

1277
01:16:25,148 --> 01:16:28,015
Repetition.

1278
01:16:28,017 --> 01:16:31,018
They call chi-raq
the pussy magician.

1279
01:16:33,089 --> 01:16:35,256
You are crazy like glue.

1280
01:16:49,237 --> 01:16:51,906
One time...

1281
01:16:51,908 --> 01:16:54,275
I saw my mom and this
dude getting it in...

1282
01:16:56,845 --> 01:16:59,814
Right after my daddy
got killed.

1283
01:16:59,816 --> 01:17:04,051
Dude named blue Monday used to come
around and try to pimp on my moms.

1284
01:17:04,053 --> 01:17:06,887
She turned a few
rent tricks, I think.

1285
01:17:06,889 --> 01:17:09,123
<i>Kill me!</i>

1286
01:17:09,125 --> 01:17:11,225
<i>Kill me!</i>

1287
01:17:13,329 --> 01:17:16,030
<i>Kill me!</i>

1288
01:17:16,032 --> 01:17:19,133
<i>Kill this pussy!</i>
<i>Kill this pussy!</i>

1289
01:17:27,009 --> 01:17:29,777
Go on, nigga, didn't I
tell your skinny black ass

1290
01:17:29,779 --> 01:17:31,912
to knock before you
come in my bedroom?

1291
01:17:31,914 --> 01:17:33,147
I'm sorry, mommy.

1292
01:17:33,149 --> 01:17:34,915
Demetrius, close
the goddamn door!

1293
01:17:34,917 --> 01:17:36,417
<i>Demetrius, go!</i>

1294
01:17:36,419 --> 01:17:38,753
Did you understand
they was making love?

1295
01:17:41,090 --> 01:17:43,391
That's what they was doing?

1296
01:17:43,393 --> 01:17:47,194
Looked more like fighting,
fucking, and screwing.

1297
01:17:48,797 --> 01:17:52,033
Blue Monday knew that
I saw him and moms.

1298
01:17:52,035 --> 01:17:53,968
Her name was Lucy.

1299
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:59,006
So one day he just
pulled me aside,

1300
01:17:59,008 --> 01:18:00,841
yanked my chain,
laced me with the games,

1301
01:18:00,843 --> 01:18:02,943
showed me how to pull
bitches and everything.

1302
01:18:04,446 --> 01:18:08,282
He soft-pitched me
my first piece.

1303
01:18:08,284 --> 01:18:10,818
I was, like, 12 years old.

1304
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:14,288
Taught me how
to be a man and shit.

1305
01:18:14,290 --> 01:18:19,026
Handed me his baddest
bottom bitch.

1306
01:18:19,028 --> 01:18:22,163
It was a present
for washing his Cadillac.

1307
01:18:22,165 --> 01:18:25,266
- My god.
- I know, right?

1308
01:18:25,268 --> 01:18:28,069
Should have got like
two or three bitches.

1309
01:18:28,071 --> 01:18:30,838
I washed the shit
out that Cadillac.

1310
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,807
Where's your moms now?

1311
01:18:32,809 --> 01:18:35,409
<i>Demetrius, close</i>
<i>the goddamn door!</i>

1312
01:18:36,445 --> 01:18:39,346
Fuck off. Talk about my mom.

1313
01:18:58,500 --> 01:19:01,469
<i>This is an emergency.</i>

1314
01:19:01,471 --> 01:19:05,072
- We're all here for peace, right?
- Yeah.

1315
01:19:05,074 --> 01:19:06,440
I wanna hear you
scream for peace.

1316
01:19:06,442 --> 01:19:08,909
Can you scream for peace?

1317
01:19:08,911 --> 01:19:11,345
'Cause that's what we want
and that's what we're about.

1318
01:19:11,347 --> 01:19:14,348
We gotta stop the killing.
We gotta stop the killing.

1319
01:19:14,350 --> 01:19:16,183
Chi-raq, what's doing?

1320
01:19:16,185 --> 01:19:17,852
You know how we do, tiny Tony.

1321
01:19:17,854 --> 01:19:19,054
Check it, man. It's all there.

1322
01:19:19,055 --> 01:19:20,855
Okay, them 30 poppers.

1323
01:19:20,857 --> 01:19:22,790
All right,
yeah, spine stoppers.

1324
01:19:24,025 --> 01:19:25,192
Keep it coming like that.

1325
01:19:25,194 --> 01:19:27,762
Appreciate it.

1326
01:19:27,764 --> 01:19:28,518
Trojans!

1327
01:19:28,544 --> 01:19:31,532
Hole in a trojan the size
of the ozone, you know?

1328
01:19:31,534 --> 01:19:34,368
Chicago's peace is our Selma.

1329
01:19:34,370 --> 01:19:37,772
Brothers and sisters, it is
time to cross the bridge.

1330
01:19:55,557 --> 01:19:57,858

01:20:10,973 --> 01:20:12,473
- What do we want?
- Peace.

1339
01:20:12,475 --> 01:20:15,342
Save our babies.
Save our babies.

1340
01:20:15,344 --> 01:20:17,812
Save our babies.
Save our babies.

1341
01:20:17,814 --> 01:20:19,380
Please, don't shoot!

Save our babies.
Save our babies.

1343
01:20:24,020 --> 01:20:26,921
It's dick day. Omaha beach.

1344
01:20:26,923 --> 01:20:29,390
And uncle Sam's pulling
out everything

1345
01:20:29,392 --> 01:20:31,358
but the bedroom sheets.

1346
01:20:31,360 --> 01:20:33,894
Now they hooking up
the noriega speakers.

1347
01:20:33,896 --> 01:20:35,429
Remember Panama, y'all?

1348
01:20:35,431 --> 01:20:38,065
That was the one
before the other one

1349
01:20:38,067 --> 01:20:40,434
before the other one
as I recall.

1350
01:20:40,436 --> 01:20:42,536
Well, them atomic
woofers and tweeters

1351
01:20:42,538 --> 01:20:45,239
made general Manuel's
machete snap.

1352
01:20:45,241 --> 01:20:47,942
Too many dbs for them
pockmarks to bear.

1353
01:20:47,944 --> 01:20:50,411
Plus he's ugly as crap.

1354
01:20:50,413 --> 01:20:54,481
Our boys caught that dictator
in a rock-and-roll trap.

1355
01:20:54,483 --> 01:20:56,550
So now the commish, too,
done figured out

1356
01:20:56,552 --> 01:20:59,620
how to make those pussies clap.

1357
01:20:59,622 --> 01:21:03,257
A black-headed woman make a
freight train jump the track.

1358
01:21:03,259 --> 01:21:07,361
A long tall gal make
a preacher ball the Jack.

1359
01:21:07,363 --> 01:21:11,465
A blonde-headed woman
make a good man leave town.

1360
01:21:11,467 --> 01:21:15,536
And a redheaded woman
make a boy slap his pappy down.

1361
01:21:15,538 --> 01:21:18,172
Ashes to ashes.

1362
01:21:18,174 --> 01:21:20,341
Dust to dust.

1363
01:21:20,343 --> 01:21:23,043
This sex strike go on

Operation hot and bothered.

We turn them on,
they turn themselves in.

1367
01:21:34,023 --> 01:21:37,057
We'll stick those prick
teasers in a federal pen.

1368
01:23:34,409 --> 01:23:38,512
Ladies, I found these earplugs
in the artillery room.

1369
01:23:38,514 --> 01:23:40,547
It should help
drown out the bombing.

1370
01:23:47,722 --> 01:23:51,592
<i>Booty, Booty, Booty,
Booty, Booty, Booty.</i>

1371

My god, he's got
Booty on the brain.

1374
01:23:57,600 --> 01:23:59,133
For god's sake, do something.

1375
01:23:59,135 --> 01:24:00,567
Yes, sir.

1376
01:24:00,569 --> 01:24:01,769
Wheel him out of here.

1377
01:24:01,771 --> 01:24:04,371
Poontang. Poontang. Poontang.

1378
01:24:04,373 --> 01:24:06,040
Poontang on the membrane.

1379
01:24:06,042 --> 01:24:09,810
I want a big Booty. I want
a small Booty. So fine!

1380
01:24:09,812 --> 01:24:12,346
- I do love those chi-lites, though.
- <i> So fine!</i>

1381
01:24:12,348 --> 01:24:16,383
Eugene record, lead singer,
wrote most of their songs.

1382
01:24:17,519 --> 01:24:20,287
Yo, peoples, dig.

1383
01:24:20,289 --> 01:24:25,225
The problem with them quiet
storm slow jam grooves

1384
01:24:25,227 --> 01:24:28,395
is everybody gets
in a baby-making mood.

1385
01:24:28,397 --> 01:24:31,665
It's been three months, y'all.
Can you believe it?

1386
01:24:31,667 --> 01:24:34,635
A long hard three.

1387
01:24:36,704 --> 01:24:39,139
This is no longer a test.

1388
01:24:39,141 --> 01:24:41,508
It's a national emergency.

1389
01:24:41,510 --> 01:24:43,277
Pussy!

1390
01:24:43,279 --> 01:24:45,512
I need some motherfucking twat

1391
01:24:45,514 --> 01:24:47,614
and I need it now.

1392
01:24:47,616 --> 01:24:51,151
It's making me fucking insane.

1393
01:24:55,190 --> 01:24:55,734
Goddamn!

1394
01:24:59,662 --> 01:25:01,829
That boy's balls
was bright blue.

1395
01:25:01,831 --> 01:25:04,364
He's an 18-Wheeler
carrying a heavy load

1396
01:25:04,366 --> 01:25:06,200
whose arrival is overdue.

1397
01:25:06,202 --> 01:25:08,769
But like wild bill told
Monica on her way down,

1398
01:25:08,771 --> 01:25:11,839
"don't let that shit drip.
They'll use it as evidence."

1399
01:25:11,841 --> 01:25:15,275
Let's speak on something
else don't make no sense.

1400
01:25:15,277 --> 01:25:17,811
Remember the two
concert gunmen?

1401
01:25:17,813 --> 01:25:19,780
Let's check in on those fools

1402
01:25:19,782 --> 01:25:21,582
and see how they do.

1403
01:25:23,718 --> 01:25:25,385
So y'all remember me?

1404
01:25:25,387 --> 01:25:27,521
But did y'all know my mission?

1405
01:25:27,523 --> 01:25:30,757
Kill those spartan niggas
before intermission.

1406
01:25:30,759 --> 01:25:34,261
Those bullets severed my spine.

1407
01:25:34,263 --> 01:25:36,163
Tore my behind.

1408
01:25:36,165 --> 01:25:37,865
Now I'm unable to walk.

1409
01:25:37,867 --> 01:25:40,234
Thank god I can still talk.

1410
01:25:40,236 --> 01:25:42,402
I was chi's boy.

1411
01:25:43,805 --> 01:25:45,305
What I'm now, I can't say.

1412
01:25:45,307 --> 01:25:48,142
What did I seek?
To be monster Greek.

1413
01:25:48,144 --> 01:25:50,577
Being thug is what I love.
How you like me now?

1414
01:25:50,579 --> 01:25:53,213
Lost a kidney, my spleen,

1415
01:25:53,215 --> 01:25:55,215
most of my digestive tract.

1416
01:25:55,217 --> 01:25:57,184
From one goddamn bullet, dawg.

1417
01:25:57,186 --> 01:25:59,153
That's the keeping it 100 fact.

1418
01:25:59,155 --> 01:26:00,854
Now I'm fed through a iv.

1419
01:26:00,856 --> 01:26:03,857
I can barely pee.
Jack, I'm no longer me.

1420
01:26:03,859 --> 01:26:06,693
What it means to be 18
and black.

1421
01:26:17,739 --> 01:26:20,941
This is sparta? Huh?

1422
01:26:20,943 --> 01:26:23,944
Squad! Gang!

1423
01:26:23,946 --> 01:26:26,680
- My niggas, what is this?
- We sparts.

1424
01:26:26,682 --> 01:26:28,882
Sparts supposed to hold them
hostage with the sausage.

1425
01:26:28,884 --> 01:26:31,552
Y'all motherfuckers
got it? Spartans.

1426
01:26:31,554 --> 01:26:34,688
I don't know why y'all crying like
somebody cancelled kwanzaa and Christmas.

1427
01:26:34,690 --> 01:26:37,491
Instead of lying in the trenches,
y'all acting like a bunch of bitches.

1428
01:26:37,493 --> 01:26:39,226
See, we just wanna
check in Betty Ford.

1429
01:26:39,228 --> 01:26:41,962
Get that sexual healing.
You know we reeling.

1430
01:26:41,964 --> 01:26:44,898
What do I care if them foo-foo heifers
lit y'all, up and negated the back?

1431
01:26:44,900 --> 01:26:47,768
I'm chi-raq, nigga.
I cuts no slack.

1432
01:26:47,770 --> 01:26:50,871
So y'all go back to your little b.B.
And Bobby blue bland rhythm.

1433
01:26:50,873 --> 01:26:52,973
Chi don't get the blues, nigga.
I give 'em.

1434
01:26:52,975 --> 01:26:54,975
Old ass Otis know.

1435
01:26:54,977 --> 01:26:57,678
This strike got spartans in
purple drawers with blue balls.

1436
01:26:57,680 --> 01:27:00,414
Well, shit, sparta,
that's on y'all.

1437
01:27:25,773 --> 01:27:27,507
<i>Born in chi-raq.</i>

1438
01:27:27,509 --> 01:27:30,010
This is ridiculous.

1439
01:27:30,012 --> 01:27:32,479
No, no, no, no, no.

1440
01:27:32,481 --> 01:27:33,981
I done put good paper
out on chi-raq.

1441
01:27:33,983 --> 01:27:35,916
Why that motherfucker
ain't dead?

1442
01:27:35,918 --> 01:27:37,851
- Can't get nobody to pull the trigger.
- What?

1443
01:27:37,853 --> 01:27:39,620
Go figure.
I'm telling you, dawg.

1444
01:27:39,622 --> 01:27:41,321
Niggas ain't the same no more.

1445
01:27:41,323 --> 01:27:44,558
All they wanna do is
just sit around thinking.

1446
01:27:44,560 --> 01:27:46,627
- Say what?
- Thinking.

1447
01:27:46,629 --> 01:27:48,929
Thinking?

1448
01:27:48,931 --> 01:27:50,931
Thinking? Thinking about what?

1449
01:27:50,933 --> 01:27:52,766
- Pussy?
- Nah, bro.

1450
01:27:52,768 --> 01:27:54,968
You thinking about pussy?

1451
01:27:54,970 --> 01:27:57,437
Purse first, ass last,
motherfucker.

1452
01:27:57,439 --> 01:27:59,539
Fuck, gs up, hos down.
Whatever happened to that?

1453
01:27:59,541 --> 01:28:02,709
Nah, about this gang life.

1454
01:28:02,711 --> 01:28:04,378
What?

1455
01:28:04,380 --> 01:28:06,747
Beso, look it here.

1456
01:28:06,749 --> 01:28:09,983
We're cheese and light fatback, baby.
Top dog since way back.

1457
01:28:09,985 --> 01:28:12,886
Come correct with this shit now.
What the fuck is going on?

1458
01:28:12,888 --> 01:28:15,889
Cyclops, you my man,
50 grand, long and strong.

1459
01:28:15,891 --> 01:28:18,058
But I'm telling you
they ain't wrong.

1460
01:28:18,060 --> 01:28:20,494
These niggas is shaking like
having a seizure in a dice game.

1461
01:28:20,496 --> 01:28:22,829
They minds is racing. And
I got a baby on the way.

1462
01:28:22,831 --> 01:28:24,798
- Oh, shit.
- I wanna see my shorty grow up

1463
01:28:24,800 --> 01:28:27,434
- and not crying over my open grave.
- <i> You're getting soft.</i>

1464
01:28:27,436 --> 01:28:29,670
People call it soft, but think
about all the niggas we lost.

1465
01:28:29,672 --> 01:28:31,571
They told me it was gonna be rough
when I got out of the joint,

1466
01:28:31,573 --> 01:28:33,440
but I didn't know
it was gonna be like this.

1467
01:28:33,442 --> 01:28:36,009
What about the war wounds, baby?
War wounds don't mean nothing?

1468
01:28:36,011 --> 01:28:37,477
Yeah, the war wounds
was when it meant something.

1469
01:28:37,479 --> 01:28:39,479
So what about your name
in the game, huh?

1470
01:28:39,481 --> 01:28:41,081
Our name has got us
six feet deep.

1471
01:28:41,083 --> 01:28:43,550
Nobody? Nobody? Jah rude?

1472
01:28:43,552 --> 01:28:46,486
Yard boy. Go on now, y'all.

1473
01:28:46,488 --> 01:28:48,722
What? Bumbaclot ratchet.

1474
01:28:48,724 --> 01:28:51,391
<i>Cyclops, you might</i>
<i>wanna a hear word, bro.</i>

1475
01:28:51,393 --> 01:28:52,994
If you ain't fixin'
to listen to me, bro,

1476
01:28:52,995 --> 01:28:55,362
you might wanna listen
to your woman indigo.

1477
01:28:57,666 --> 01:28:59,566
You're not gonna listen?

1478
01:28:59,568 --> 01:29:01,468
- Bro, you can at least talk to me.
- Okay, okay.

1479
01:29:01,470 --> 01:29:03,103
- Let's talk eye to eye.
- Okay. Okay, yeah.

1480
01:29:03,105 --> 01:29:04,871
Eye to eye patch.

1481
01:29:07,642 --> 01:29:09,476
Chastity belt keys up.

1482
01:29:15,917 --> 01:29:18,085
Like clockwork, Rasheeda.

1483
01:29:20,021 --> 01:29:21,521
Go, come on.

1484
01:29:21,523 --> 01:29:23,757
Move. Go, go.

1485
01:29:23,759 --> 01:29:24,958
Go, go.

1486
01:29:28,429 --> 01:29:31,098
Come on, doc.
Get on up there, doc.

1487
01:29:31,100 --> 01:29:33,467
There you go. After you.

1488
01:29:35,636 --> 01:29:37,871
Ow.

1489
01:29:37,873 --> 01:29:39,740
You're a pig.

1490
01:29:39,742 --> 01:29:41,575
If I didn't miss
my boo so much,

1491
01:29:41,577 --> 01:29:43,477
I would slap
the shit out of you!

1492
01:29:52,887 --> 01:29:58,392
Bitches and hos,
come out to play.

1493
01:29:58,394 --> 01:30:02,095
Bitches and hos,
come out to play.

1494
01:30:02,097 --> 01:30:04,898
With our keys, we shall unlock

1495
01:30:04,900 --> 01:30:07,100
the sacred brotherhood
of male needs

1496
01:30:07,102 --> 01:30:09,803
and seize the means
of reproduction.

1497
01:30:09,805 --> 01:30:13,940
Those chastity belts are no
match for a manly man's keys.

1498
01:30:13,942 --> 01:30:16,176
Time to let that thing breathe.

1499
01:30:16,178 --> 01:30:18,478
So pack up this
Gloria steinem act

1500
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:20,947
and get y'all ass
back in the damn sack.

1501
01:30:41,436 --> 01:30:44,471
Take off those chastity belts
and surrender the armory.

1502
01:30:44,473 --> 01:30:46,139
Nobody moves, nobody gets hurt.

1503
01:30:48,444 --> 01:30:51,545
- You all right?
- What's going on?

1504
01:30:51,547 --> 01:30:53,547
Well, well, well.

1505
01:30:55,716 --> 01:30:57,651
What's up?

1506
01:31:03,458 --> 01:31:05,625
That all you got?

1507
01:31:05,627 --> 01:31:08,195
Girl, this sex strike scheme
ain't nothing but a wet dream.

1508
01:31:08,197 --> 01:31:10,630
You're trying to act
all NFL Roger Goodell.

1509
01:31:10,632 --> 01:31:13,066
Wench, please, all you
chicks gonna burn in hell.

1510
01:31:13,068 --> 01:31:16,136
Don't worry. If you act
polite and not all saditty,

1511
01:31:16,138 --> 01:31:18,505
we just might issue you
some damn pity.

1512
01:31:18,507 --> 01:31:21,875
Nah, see, we don't wanna fight,

1513
01:31:21,877 --> 01:31:25,078
but you cro-magnon
can't walk upright.

1514
01:31:25,080 --> 01:31:26,947
You old dudes,
you lack insight.

1515
01:31:26,949 --> 01:31:28,215
Who your mommy and daddy?

1516
01:31:28,217 --> 01:31:30,083
I gots no mommy and daddy.

1517
01:31:30,085 --> 01:31:32,919
- You ain't got no folks?
- Everybody's my folks.

1518
01:31:32,921 --> 01:31:37,090
So you never had a pappy to
school you on the female way.

1519
01:31:37,092 --> 01:31:40,527
It takes a man to teach a
heifer like you how to behave.

1520
01:31:40,529 --> 01:31:44,664
I'm sorry that our effort to reform
has left you unable to perform.

1521
01:31:44,666 --> 01:31:46,766
But even before the strike,

1522
01:31:46,768 --> 01:31:49,803
that's what your penile
implants was like...

1523
01:31:49,805 --> 01:31:51,104
soft.

1524
01:31:51,106 --> 01:31:54,140
Oh, snap!

1525
01:32:06,187 --> 01:32:08,622
You trifling
little black bitch.

1526
01:32:13,261 --> 01:32:15,228
This ain't no joke.

1527
01:32:15,230 --> 01:32:18,832
You old tired dicks
just want a Viagra poke.

1528
01:32:18,834 --> 01:32:21,635
Dude, this is about
life and death,

1529
01:32:21,637 --> 01:32:23,670
about a community
that's a wreck.

1530
01:32:23,672 --> 01:32:26,573
And you wanna sit here
and talk about how women behave?

1531
01:32:26,575 --> 01:32:29,609
Fool, we trying to free
these slaves.

1532
01:32:29,611 --> 01:32:32,312
Slaves to the madness.
Slaves to this violence.

1533
01:32:32,314 --> 01:32:34,247
And what, you just want us
to silence?

1534
01:32:34,249 --> 01:32:38,318
We gonna make sure these fools
put down these guns

1535
01:32:38,320 --> 01:32:41,588
and stop thinking
that this craziness is fun.

1536
01:32:41,590 --> 01:32:44,057
You see, we women,
we understand

1537
01:32:44,059 --> 01:32:47,260
that life is about more
than polishing your knobs.

1538
01:32:47,262 --> 01:32:50,297
Saving lives, that's our job.

1539
01:32:50,299 --> 01:32:52,799
It's about bringing
an end to this strife

1540
01:32:52,801 --> 01:32:55,101
and giving the hood
the true meaning of life.

1541
01:32:57,838 --> 01:32:59,906
What is the true
meaning of life?

1542
01:33:02,343 --> 01:33:04,945
You don't know?

1543
01:33:04,947 --> 01:33:08,982
Ole Duke, why don't
we go home, huh?

1544
01:33:08,984 --> 01:33:12,886
My mommy is worried about
you and I and the knights.

1545
01:33:12,888 --> 01:33:15,855
<i>- Your mommy?</i>
<i>- Yeah, yeah. Whatever.</i>

1546
01:33:15,857 --> 01:33:17,757
<i>Your mommy's on strike, too.</i>

1547
01:33:17,759 --> 01:33:20,160
<i>Thank you, guys.</i>
<i>Bye, have a good night.</i>

1548
01:33:20,162 --> 01:33:22,929
And don't forget, no peace...

1549
01:33:22,931 --> 01:33:24,931
No pussy.

1550
01:33:24,933 --> 01:33:28,068
No peace, no pussy.

1551
01:33:29,938 --> 01:33:31,104
Damn!

1552
01:34:01,669 --> 01:34:04,204
Brooklyn, put the guns down.

1553
01:34:04,206 --> 01:34:06,906
Brooklyn, put the guns down.

1554
01:34:06,908 --> 01:34:09,876
Brooklyn, put the guns down.

1555
01:34:09,878 --> 01:34:12,779
<i>Brooklyn, put the guns down.</i>

1556
01:34:12,781 --> 01:34:15,348
<i>Brooklyn, put the guns down.</i>

1557
01:34:15,350 --> 01:34:16,850
<i>Brooklyn...</i>

1558
01:34:16,852 --> 01:34:18,818
The president
called me this morning.

1559
01:34:18,820 --> 01:34:20,720
- The president?
- He was very upset.

1560
01:34:20,722 --> 01:34:22,422
World leaders are in crisis.

1561
01:34:22,424 --> 01:34:24,991
The infrastructures of their
country are collapsing.

1562
01:34:24,993 --> 01:34:26,893
The leader of the free world

1563
01:34:26,895 --> 01:34:29,162
thinks the entire matter
is my fault.

1564
01:34:29,164 --> 01:34:30,964
Mr. mayor, it's not your fault.

1565
01:34:30,966 --> 01:34:32,932
That's right because
it's your cocksucking fault!

1566
01:34:32,934 --> 01:34:35,435
The president of the United
States called me a name today.

1567
01:34:35,437 --> 01:34:38,138
- No, Mr. mayor.
- Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

1568
01:34:38,140 --> 01:34:40,974
The president of the
United States of America

1569
01:34:40,976 --> 01:34:44,911
called me a motherfucking
sorry-ass punk-ass bitch.

1570
01:34:44,913 --> 01:34:47,781
Oh, yes. It seems the first
lady has taken the oath.

1571
01:34:47,783 --> 01:34:50,083
And what's worse,
my wife has taken the oath.

1572
01:34:50,085 --> 01:34:52,018
She's a sexy young thing.

1573
01:34:52,020 --> 01:34:55,221
Beautiful.
Former model/stripper.

1574
01:34:55,223 --> 01:34:57,190
Honey, I'm home.

1575
01:34:57,192 --> 01:34:59,426
<i>I'm in the bedroom.</i>

1576
01:35:03,731 --> 01:35:06,399
Imhotep arrives.

1577
01:35:08,836 --> 01:35:12,472
- Oh. Oh.
- Ahoy, my queen.

1578
01:35:12,474 --> 01:35:17,143
Oh, Mr. mayor, baby.
I am so hot.

1579
01:35:17,145 --> 01:35:20,313
Your honor. My pharaoh.

1580
01:35:20,315 --> 01:35:23,450
I will now take
my chi-town Cleopatra.

1581
01:35:25,853 --> 01:35:29,789
No peace, no pussy.

1582
01:35:29,791 --> 01:35:31,891
If I can't have
my wife's pretty bottom,

1583
01:35:31,893 --> 01:35:33,893
from your tush
I'll find meaning.

1584
01:35:33,895 --> 01:35:37,230
And you'll be squealing like you
were in that movie "deliverance."

1585
01:35:42,937 --> 01:35:45,171
Give thisLysistrata
what she wants.

1586
01:35:45,173 --> 01:35:47,841
- She wants world peace.
- Give her fucking world peace!

1587
01:35:47,843 --> 01:35:50,744
You read me? Get the job done!

1588
01:36:34,355 --> 01:36:37,524
<i>Chi-raq! Chi-raq!</i>

1589
01:36:56,043 --> 01:36:57,811
You know I knew your pops.

1590
01:36:57,813 --> 01:36:59,512
Father's in there.

1591
01:37:14,528 --> 01:37:15,895
I'm good.

1592
01:37:19,433 --> 01:37:21,601
We need you and the spartans
to come down to the armory

1593
01:37:21,603 --> 01:37:24,437
and join in the peach talks.

1594
01:37:24,439 --> 01:37:27,231
Fuck I care if these
lames ain't getting ass?

1595
01:37:27,257 --> 01:37:28,141
Ain't my task.

1596
01:37:28,143 --> 01:37:29,509
So Lysistrata's not your woman?

1597
01:37:29,511 --> 01:37:32,145
Now you're fucking with my rep.

1598
01:37:32,147 --> 01:37:33,379
Bigger than your fucking rep.

1599
01:37:35,015 --> 01:37:38,451
Ain't no such thing.

1600
01:37:38,453 --> 01:37:40,493
Father, you know what
I've always wanted to ask you?

1601
01:37:42,022 --> 01:37:44,524
What a white boy like you

1602
01:37:44,526 --> 01:37:47,994
doing all up in the e-dub
all these years?

1603
01:37:47,996 --> 01:37:50,063
I grew up eight blocks
from St. Sabina.

1604
01:37:50,065 --> 01:37:52,599
When I took a vow
to be a priest,

1605
01:37:52,601 --> 01:37:54,601
it had to be in the streets
'cause Jesus rolled

1606
01:37:54,603 --> 01:37:56,135
with the suffering
and the poor.

1607
01:37:58,539 --> 01:38:01,875
Imagine no more stray bullets

1608
01:38:01,877 --> 01:38:04,110
killing innocent children
like Patti no more.

1609
01:38:08,916 --> 01:38:11,885
Bullets ain't got
no name, no eyes.

1610
01:38:11,887 --> 01:38:13,219
<i>That's right.</i>

1611
01:38:13,221 --> 01:38:16,189
They're just designed
to take lives.

1612
01:38:16,191 --> 01:38:18,992
Like they'll take yours
soon, son.

1613
01:38:18,994 --> 01:38:21,227
Three places
you're gonna end up...

1614
01:38:21,229 --> 01:38:24,230
county morgue, county
hospital or county jail.

1615
01:38:24,232 --> 01:38:28,001
<i>People downtown</i>
<i>don't give a fuck about you.</i>

1616
01:38:28,003 --> 01:38:30,236
You in the system. You in jail.

1617
01:38:30,238 --> 01:38:32,238
And you won't make bail.

1618
01:38:32,240 --> 01:38:35,041
And it's privatized now
to capitalize.

1619
01:38:35,043 --> 01:38:38,378
No more insurance card.
No more family to feed.

1620
01:38:38,380 --> 01:38:40,179
You hanging from a tree.

1621
01:38:40,181 --> 01:38:41,614
You're not even
costing them money.

1622
01:38:41,616 --> 01:38:43,917
You're making them money.

1623
01:38:43,919 --> 01:38:46,686
And nobody's gonna
hear your bitching

1624
01:38:46,688 --> 01:38:49,956
'cause this is a new
legal form of lynching.

1625
01:38:55,263 --> 01:38:57,997
That's all you got,
huh, padre Miguel?

1626
01:38:57,999 --> 01:39:01,467
God loves you. I love you.

1627
01:39:01,469 --> 01:39:04,470
And I believe in my heart you
have a higher purpose than this.

1628
01:39:09,276 --> 01:39:11,678
Presided over
your father's funeral.

1629
01:39:11,680 --> 01:39:13,713
That mean anything to you?

1630
01:39:29,730 --> 01:39:32,198
That enough for your
little collection basket?

1631
01:39:36,136 --> 01:39:38,171
Thank you for the donation...

1632
01:39:40,074 --> 01:39:42,375
Towards the $5,000 bounty

1633
01:39:42,377 --> 01:39:45,178
leading to the arrest
of Patti's killer.

1634
01:39:47,348 --> 01:39:49,415
<i>I'll pray for you.</i>

1635
01:39:49,417 --> 01:39:51,150
<i>Be safe.</i>

1636
01:40:08,569 --> 01:40:10,470
Hey, hey.

1637
01:40:55,682 --> 01:40:58,151
Come on, let's go.

1638
01:40:58,153 --> 01:41:00,353
Any chance you could
pull your pants up?

1639
01:41:31,518 --> 01:41:33,753
Yo, Lys. It's me, chi.

1640
01:41:33,755 --> 01:41:35,555
Come to your senses?

1641
01:41:35,557 --> 01:41:37,824
- I got a proposition.
- Speak.

1642
01:41:37,826 --> 01:41:39,792
- A showdown.
- A showdown?

1643
01:41:39,794 --> 01:41:41,427
- That's right.
- Who?

1644
01:41:41,429 --> 01:41:44,497
- Me and you.
- I'm not gonna shoot you.

1645
01:41:44,499 --> 01:41:47,600
Not a death match.
It's a sex match.

1646
01:41:47,602 --> 01:41:50,303
First one to surrender loses.

1647
01:41:50,305 --> 01:41:52,572
You lose, you end all this.

1648
01:41:52,574 --> 01:41:54,440
No charges filed.

1649
01:41:54,442 --> 01:41:57,877
You'll make a public statement
apologizing to all men.

1650
01:41:57,879 --> 01:41:59,545
It's over. Done with.

1651
01:41:59,547 --> 01:42:01,147
And when I win?

1652
01:42:01,149 --> 01:42:03,149
You get whatever it is
you're trying to do.

1653
01:42:03,151 --> 01:42:06,252
P-e-a-c-e.

1654
01:42:06,254 --> 01:42:09,522
P-I-e-c-e.

1655
01:42:09,524 --> 01:42:11,257
Pretty damn sure of yourself.

1656
01:42:55,537 --> 01:42:57,803
- Contact.
- There he is.

1657
01:42:57,805 --> 01:42:59,839
This is better than
the goddamn super bowl.

1658
01:43:01,643 --> 01:43:03,943
Pop them on the griddle.
Dice 'em, slice 'em,

1659
01:43:03,945 --> 01:43:05,478
bait 'em, stew him
in his own caresses.

1660
01:43:05,480 --> 01:43:06,746
Justice.

1661
01:43:06,748 --> 01:43:09,248
- I wish.
- I pray.

1662
01:43:09,250 --> 01:43:11,817
We should all pray.

1663
01:43:14,589 --> 01:43:17,190
- What it do?
- 'Sup?

1664
01:43:17,192 --> 01:43:18,391
It's been a while.

1665
01:43:18,393 --> 01:43:21,961
Three months,
13 days, three hours,

1666
01:43:21,963 --> 01:43:23,963
seven minutes, and two seconds.

1667
01:43:23,965 --> 01:43:25,731
Counting days, huh, bae?

1668
01:43:25,733 --> 01:43:27,900
That's how long we women
have been on strike.

1669
01:43:27,902 --> 01:43:29,869
I see you still on fleek.

1670
01:43:29,871 --> 01:43:33,506
Not playing meek.

1671
01:43:33,508 --> 01:43:35,975
Damn!

1672
01:43:35,977 --> 01:43:37,710
Oh, fine!

1673
01:43:37,712 --> 01:43:39,979
You know I got
feelings for you.

1674
01:43:39,981 --> 01:43:41,881
Feelings for me?

1675
01:43:41,883 --> 01:43:43,816
Down to the bone.

1676
01:43:43,818 --> 01:43:47,720
Chi, I'm not picking
a bone with you.

1677
01:43:47,722 --> 01:43:50,256
I know you miss
daddy dick nasty.

1678
01:43:50,258 --> 01:43:52,792
Not more than you
miss this steamy,

1679
01:43:52,794 --> 01:43:54,961
creamy, hot butter biscuit.

1680
01:43:54,963 --> 01:43:57,563
Hot butter biscuit.

1681
01:43:57,565 --> 01:44:00,299
I'm on fire with desire.

1682
01:44:00,301 --> 01:44:02,935
Bring it out.

1683
01:44:25,994 --> 01:44:28,995
- A brass bed?
- That's enemy lead.

1684
01:44:28,997 --> 01:44:31,864
Mmm, that's a big ass brass bed

1685
01:44:31,866 --> 01:44:35,434
for banging black Booty.

1686
01:44:35,436 --> 01:44:37,937
What? My wife's biracial.

1687
01:44:37,939 --> 01:44:40,873
Whoever comes first loses.

1688
01:44:54,822 --> 01:44:57,423
We had some good times.

1689
01:44:57,425 --> 01:44:59,025
<i>A few.</i>

1690
01:45:00,694 --> 01:45:03,663
Especially in the am.

1691
01:45:03,665 --> 01:45:07,466
You always liked it
in the morning.

1692
01:45:07,468 --> 01:45:11,003
Like you liked it at night.

1693
01:45:11,005 --> 01:45:12,805
Yeah.

1694
01:45:12,807 --> 01:45:14,507
Right and tight.

1695
01:45:18,445 --> 01:45:20,379
Missed you.

1696
01:45:22,783 --> 01:45:24,517
I missed you back.

1697
01:45:24,519 --> 01:45:27,086
You got them bedroom eyes.

1698
01:45:27,088 --> 01:45:29,588
Like your man biggie say,

1699
01:45:29,590 --> 01:45:32,625
they hypnotize.

1700
01:45:32,627 --> 01:45:36,095
And like your man Tupac said,

1701
01:45:36,097 --> 01:45:38,064
how do you want it?

1702
01:45:40,100 --> 01:45:41,967
Mm.

1703
01:45:41,969 --> 01:45:44,537
Remember our first?

1704
01:45:44,539 --> 01:45:47,340
We was in a club.

1705
01:45:47,342 --> 01:45:49,909
You was looking too damn good.

1706
01:45:51,713 --> 01:45:54,113
I had the chicken and waffle.

1707
01:45:54,115 --> 01:45:56,515
- You had the ribs.
- Yum, yum.

1708
01:45:56,517 --> 01:45:58,584
Took you to the crib,

1709
01:45:58,586 --> 01:46:01,053
showed you how I live.

1710
01:46:01,055 --> 01:46:03,356
Got you some wine.

1711
01:46:03,358 --> 01:46:05,057
Yeah.

1712
01:46:05,059 --> 01:46:06,692
Beautiful time.

1713
01:46:06,694 --> 01:46:08,861
Mm.

1714
01:46:13,534 --> 01:46:15,868
You smell good.

1715
01:46:15,870 --> 01:46:17,903
I know.

1716
01:46:27,848 --> 01:46:30,683
Now what about peace?

1717
01:46:30,685 --> 01:46:34,520
Shit, you the only
piece I need.

1718
01:46:54,041 --> 01:46:58,144
Turn them goddamn
motherfucking lights out!

1719
01:47:02,516 --> 01:47:04,517
<i>Come on, baby, just come.</i>

1720
01:47:04,519 --> 01:47:06,952
<i>Come for me. Come for me, baby.</i>

1721
01:47:06,954 --> 01:47:08,954
<i>Yeah.</i>

1722
01:47:08,956 --> 01:47:12,091
<i>Oh! Oh, chi.</i>

1723
01:47:12,093 --> 01:47:12,593
<i>Shit.</i>

1724
01:47:16,164 --> 01:47:18,998
<i>Missed giving it to you.</i>

1725
01:47:19,000 --> 01:47:21,834
<i>We gonna win. We gonna win.</i>

1726
01:47:28,141 --> 01:47:31,444
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

1727
01:47:34,481 --> 01:47:36,048
We done, yo.

1728
01:47:36,050 --> 01:47:37,783
- Cyclops?
- Oh!

1729
01:47:37,785 --> 01:47:39,552
Oh!

1730
01:47:39,554 --> 01:47:41,887
- That's my man.
- What?

1731
01:47:41,889 --> 01:47:43,989
We done.

1732
01:47:43,991 --> 01:47:45,658
You know we wrong, right?

1733
01:47:45,660 --> 01:47:48,461
- The fuck you mean we wrong?
- Dead wrong.

1734
01:47:48,463 --> 01:47:51,664
I want my woman indigo more than
I want a dead yo spartan purple.

1735
01:47:51,666 --> 01:47:54,166
Not getting some because
we out here acting dumb?

1736
01:47:54,168 --> 01:47:57,736
I'd rather my glock don't
cock than my nuts stay numb.

1737
01:47:57,738 --> 01:47:59,672
<i>Lysistrata took no pity.</i>

1738
01:47:59,674 --> 01:48:02,708
Turned out every gangster in this city.
Global, really.

1739
01:48:02,710 --> 01:48:05,778
<i>I asked cyclops to be here.
You've been played for peace.</i>

1740
01:48:05,780 --> 01:48:09,482
<i>This the 411.
Listen to your queen, son.</i>

1741
01:48:09,484 --> 01:48:11,684
I had time
to reevaluate my shit.

1742
01:48:11,686 --> 01:48:15,187
Don't think I turned bitch, but
motherfuckers like us in the life,

1743
01:48:15,189 --> 01:48:17,656
we, too, need to strike.

1744
01:48:17,658 --> 01:48:19,925
Put some change in our refrain

1745
01:48:19,927 --> 01:48:22,795
and stop all of this
killing pain.

1746
01:48:22,797 --> 01:48:26,031
Thus...

1747
01:48:28,668 --> 01:48:30,836
We the united federation
of gangsterism

1748
01:48:30,838 --> 01:48:34,507
for the state of
Drillinois hereby decree

1749
01:48:34,509 --> 01:48:36,575
we cashing in our chips.

1750
01:48:36,577 --> 01:48:38,811
Done with all
of this dumb shit.

1751
01:48:38,813 --> 01:48:41,180
<i>Now we just waiting on you.</i>

1752
01:48:41,182 --> 01:48:43,916
So what it be, g?

1753
01:48:43,918 --> 01:48:45,584
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Whatever, nigga.

1754
01:48:45,586 --> 01:48:47,152
Look, I'm over here
putting in work.

1755
01:48:47,154 --> 01:48:50,923
I got this. I'm about to win.

1756
01:48:50,925 --> 01:48:52,091
We got this.

1757
01:48:55,295 --> 01:48:57,630
We...

1758
01:48:57,632 --> 01:48:59,131
Got nothing.

1759
01:50:12,005 --> 01:50:15,708
Every fortune 500 company
has signed the peace accord

1760
01:50:15,710 --> 01:50:20,312
ensuring that every person
in the hoods of America

1761
01:50:20,314 --> 01:50:23,949
of employment age
is guaranteed a job.

1762
01:50:23,951 --> 01:50:25,951
And I don't mean
no minimum age neither.

1763
01:50:32,125 --> 01:50:34,393
New hospitals and mental
health facilities

1764
01:50:34,395 --> 01:50:37,730
<i>will be built by the
United States government.</i>

1765
01:50:37,732 --> 01:50:40,666
<i>And finally, there will be a
much needed trauma center</i>

1766
01:50:40,668 --> 01:50:42,635
<i>on Chicago's south side.</i>

1767
01:50:44,805 --> 01:50:46,805
Lysistrata,

1768
01:50:46,807 --> 01:50:51,210
this is what
justice looks like.

1769
01:50:55,682 --> 01:50:58,150
We will now sign
the peace accord.

1770
01:51:06,861 --> 01:51:08,327
Yeah.

1771
01:51:13,133 --> 01:51:16,301
Peace is not
the absence of war,

1772
01:51:16,303 --> 01:51:19,338
but a new found love
for one another.

1773
01:51:19,340 --> 01:51:21,306
Your Johnsons brought
you to the table,

1774
01:51:21,308 --> 01:51:23,676
but that truce is unstable.

1775
01:51:23,678 --> 01:51:26,779
<i>We need truth and
reconciliation for the victims,</i>

1776
01:51:26,781 --> 01:51:29,181
<i>the ones that live</i>
<i>with this pain of loss</i>

1777
01:51:29,183 --> 01:51:33,185
and must deal with
the long-term human cost.

1778
01:51:44,197 --> 01:51:46,231
<i>Chi-raq.</i>

1779
01:52:20,400 --> 01:52:22,968
We are the mothers
of the hoods.

1780
01:52:22,970 --> 01:52:26,972
All have lost someone
to this senseless war.

1781
01:52:26,974 --> 01:52:28,974
There will be
no birthdays for them.

1782
01:52:28,976 --> 01:52:31,110
No first dates.

1783
01:52:31,112 --> 01:52:34,346
No walk down the aisles.
No tomorrows.

1784
01:52:34,348 --> 01:52:36,849
Why the fuck y'all got
me on full blast?

1785
01:52:36,851 --> 01:52:38,450
Why y'all trying
to put me on front street?

1786
01:52:38,452 --> 01:52:41,787
This is my Pam.
She is 10 years old.

1787
01:52:41,789 --> 01:52:44,356
- I don't want to hear that shit.
- Chi! Please.

1788
01:52:45,825 --> 01:52:48,160
One summer day

1789
01:52:48,162 --> 01:52:51,497
back when we lived in the
cabrini-green projects,

1790
01:52:51,499 --> 01:52:55,534
Pam was outside
jumping double Dutch

1791
01:52:55,536 --> 01:52:57,536
when they started shooting.

1792
01:52:57,538 --> 01:53:01,406
She was shot
through her left eye

1793
01:53:01,408 --> 01:53:04,376
by a stray bullet.

1794
01:53:04,378 --> 01:53:06,545
This was over 20 years ago.

1795
01:53:06,547 --> 01:53:10,482
And children dying
from stray bullets

1796
01:53:10,484 --> 01:53:13,886
wasn't a common occurrence
like it is today.

1797
01:53:15,421 --> 01:53:18,891
Days later, a young man
came to my apartment

1798
01:53:18,893 --> 01:53:22,361
and he begged my forgiveness.

1799
01:53:24,397 --> 01:53:27,800
Then he confessed
to the police.

1800
01:53:27,802 --> 01:53:31,336
Back then it was a violation

1801
01:53:31,338 --> 01:53:35,507
of the gang code
to murder children.

1802
01:53:39,345 --> 01:53:42,080
He knew.

1803
01:53:42,082 --> 01:53:44,283
He knew

1804
01:53:44,285 --> 01:53:47,085
if he didn't confess
to me and the police,

1805
01:53:47,087 --> 01:53:50,455
that the gangs
would end his life.

1806
01:53:52,592 --> 01:53:55,194
That man was your father.

1807
01:53:56,863 --> 01:53:58,831
Jamel.

1808
01:54:09,609 --> 01:54:11,610
Never knew him.

1809
01:54:13,346 --> 01:54:15,581
Only heard stories.

1810
01:54:17,483 --> 01:54:20,485
Got killed in prison
when I was just a shorty.

1811
01:54:20,487 --> 01:54:23,021
He tried to be a good man.

1812
01:54:25,425 --> 01:54:28,260
You can be a good man.

1813
01:54:34,334 --> 01:54:36,401
Be a good man.

1814
01:54:40,874 --> 01:54:42,875
Be a good man.

1815
01:54:46,246 --> 01:54:48,280
Be a good man.

1816
01:54:50,450 --> 01:54:52,451
Be a good man.

1817
01:54:54,888 --> 01:54:57,055
Be a good man.

1818
01:54:59,292 --> 01:55:01,994
Be a good man.

1819
01:55:19,045 --> 01:55:20,545
I did dirt.

1820
01:55:20,547 --> 01:55:23,916
You got something
you wanna say?

1821
01:55:45,271 --> 01:55:47,339
I killed your baby Patti.

1822
01:55:52,211 --> 01:55:53,578
God!

1823
01:55:53,580 --> 01:55:55,480
It was an accident.

1824
01:55:55,482 --> 01:55:57,416
God!

1825
01:55:58,484 --> 01:56:00,285
God!

1826
01:56:00,287 --> 01:56:02,421
<i>God!</i>

1827
01:56:23,509 --> 01:56:26,678
Pray for me. Please.

1828
01:56:28,748 --> 01:56:31,416
What y'all looking at?

1829
01:56:31,418 --> 01:56:33,752
Time for you to do the same.

1830
01:56:33,754 --> 01:56:36,588
Take the blame. Take the claim.

1831
01:56:36,590 --> 01:56:39,257
Take it on the chin
and confess your sins.

1832
01:56:39,259 --> 01:56:42,127
Be a man and quit trying to
suppress this pain you in.

1833
01:56:42,129 --> 01:56:44,529
Hell of a mess,
this gang you in.

1834
01:56:44,531 --> 01:56:46,732
Sleepless nights.

1835
01:56:46,734 --> 01:56:48,467
Too weak to fight.

1836
01:56:48,469 --> 01:56:50,235
Couldn't reach us
to teach us right.

1837
01:56:50,237 --> 01:56:53,138
Our crying mothers.
Our dying brothers.

1838
01:56:53,140 --> 01:56:56,441
D and d, that's what they want us to be.
Deaf and dumb.

1839
01:56:56,443 --> 01:56:59,111
But you see, the only one
we protecting is the gun.

1840
01:56:59,113 --> 01:57:02,280
So run, nigga, run.
I let it run out of me.

1841
01:57:02,282 --> 01:57:05,117
'Cause I'm finally free
from all these demons.

1842
01:57:05,119 --> 01:57:07,686
Finally, they leaving.
Finally, I'm breathing.

1843
01:57:07,688 --> 01:57:10,455
So bring the truth.
Bring the truth.

1844
01:57:10,457 --> 01:57:12,591
Bring the truth, brother.
Bring it.

1845
01:57:23,436 --> 01:57:25,103
He'll be all right.

1846
01:57:25,105 --> 01:57:27,639
Chi-raq can take care
of himself.

1847
01:57:27,641 --> 01:57:29,708
That's Demetrius.

1848
01:57:29,710 --> 01:57:32,077
It's not chi-raq.

1849
01:57:52,131 --> 01:57:54,766
As Stevie wonder sings,

1850
01:57:54,768 --> 01:57:57,302
all in love is fair.

1851
01:57:57,304 --> 01:57:59,604
Well, I ain't
too sure about that,

1852
01:57:59,606 --> 01:58:02,441
but for now I'll say yeah.

1853
01:58:02,443 --> 01:58:04,543
Lysistrata formed an army

1854
01:58:04,545 --> 01:58:07,179
more powerful
than the Roman empire.

1855
01:58:07,181 --> 01:58:11,249
Burned through the city
just like that Chicago fire.

1856
01:58:11,251 --> 01:58:15,454
So remember
queen prophet Lysistrata

1857
01:58:15,456 --> 01:58:19,257
and the lessons
that she taught you.

1858
01:58:19,259 --> 01:58:23,628
The only real security
is love, y'all.

1859
01:58:23,630 --> 01:58:24,174
L-o-v-e.

1860
01:58:28,402 --> 01:58:31,470
Let's all together make chi-raq

1861
01:58:31,472 --> 01:58:34,272
back into Chicago,

1862
01:58:34,274 --> 01:58:36,842
city of the broad shoulders.

1863
01:58:39,479 --> 01:58:42,347
Peace. Two fingers.

1864
01:58:48,221 --> 01:58:50,856
Wake up!

1865
01:58:58,297 --> 01:59:00,265
<i>This is an emergency.</i>
