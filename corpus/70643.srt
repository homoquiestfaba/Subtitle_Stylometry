1
00:00:59,087 --> 00:00:59,917
What's up?

2
00:01:01,022 --> 00:01:01,852
Nothing.

3
00:01:02,057 --> 00:01:03,957
You don't work for me no more?

4
00:01:04,292 --> 00:01:07,693
I was just... Didn't I just say I was
going to get his money?

5
00:01:08,196 --> 00:01:10,687
Bitch, I don't work for
the phone company.

6
00:01:10,965 --> 00:01:14,958
I don't do this shit long distance.
Bring your ass here.

7
00:01:25,647 --> 00:01:29,743
Do I look like I just fell off
a turnip truck, bitch?

8
00:01:31,152 --> 00:01:35,145
You know, Bobby, you been acting
kind of strange lately. You okay?

9
00:01:37,559 --> 00:01:40,619
Just had a few personal problems.
It's taken care of...

10
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:42,558
What kind of problems?

11
00:01:42,764 --> 00:01:44,425
l'll straighten it out.

12
00:01:44,632 --> 00:01:46,065
You sure?

13
00:01:46,267 --> 00:01:48,827
Absolutely. Don't worry about it.

14
00:01:54,676 --> 00:01:57,474
What's he doing? He's beating this girl.

15
00:01:59,347 --> 00:02:02,680
We got a 3-million dollar hit
about to go down over here.

16
00:02:02,917 --> 00:02:04,908
You don't like it, turn your head.

17
00:02:06,921 --> 00:02:08,252
Come on, Gino.

18
00:02:12,527 --> 00:02:14,085
Guys, we're coming in.

19
00:02:14,629 --> 00:02:16,096
Gino's blowing it. Let's go.

20
00:02:23,371 --> 00:02:24,702
I'm pregnant.

21
00:02:25,039 --> 00:02:28,440
You pregnant?! You let some trick
get you pregnant?!

22
00:02:29,344 --> 00:02:31,938
Ain't you ever heard of a rubber?!

23
00:02:43,458 --> 00:02:46,723
This motherfucker hit me.
I'm scared l'll lose my baby.

24
00:02:47,028 --> 00:02:48,552
You wop motherfucker!

25
00:02:56,271 --> 00:02:57,898
What the fuck you doing?!

26
00:02:58,239 --> 00:02:59,069
You talking to me?

27
00:02:59,274 --> 00:03:00,741
Who the fuck you think you are?!

28
00:03:00,975 --> 00:03:03,239
You like to beat up on
fucking women?

29
00:03:03,878 --> 00:03:04,970
Beat up on me.

30
00:03:05,246 --> 00:03:07,237
Oh, yeah, that's right.

31
00:03:07,482 --> 00:03:11,543
I know where you live, motherfucker.
l'll fuck your wife and kids...

32
00:03:21,095 --> 00:03:22,585
Gino, you son of a bitch!

33
00:03:56,431 --> 00:03:58,956
I got some unfinished business
to take care of.

34
00:03:59,534 --> 00:04:01,525
It'll be over
by the end of tonight.

35
00:04:02,203 --> 00:04:04,364
Stick by me, all that money's yours.

36
00:04:06,374 --> 00:04:07,534
That's a lot of money.

37
00:04:08,142 --> 00:04:10,474
We stuck with you through
worse for free.

38
00:04:11,913 --> 00:04:13,278
How long could the night be?

39
00:04:34,902 --> 00:04:37,234
Mommy, can I get a hot dog?

40
00:04:38,072 --> 00:04:40,734
No, honey.
Forget about it, okay?

41
00:04:45,747 --> 00:04:48,580
If you eat a hot dog now,
you'll ruin your dinner.

42
00:04:48,850 --> 00:04:52,183
Also, do me a favor.
IKeep your sneakers clean tonight.

43
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:55,355
No dirt, no puddles.
We got a party tonight.

44
00:05:03,765 --> 00:05:07,098
Let's go in here to get some stuff.
Bobby, l'll take the kids.

45
00:05:32,026 --> 00:05:33,288
How's that feel, Bobby?

46
00:05:34,262 --> 00:05:35,786
You ain't laughing now.

47
00:06:08,162 --> 00:06:09,424
How you doing?

48
00:06:09,664 --> 00:06:12,326
Good.
Dad, can we play catch or what?

49
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:14,424
You finish your homework?

50
00:06:14,769 --> 00:06:17,169
No?
And you still want to play catch?

51
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:20,930
Go get your stuff.

52
00:06:26,781 --> 00:06:28,749
Stop the car. Give me the pipe.

53
00:06:28,950 --> 00:06:31,441
Doing a cop
right in the street like that!

54
00:06:31,652 --> 00:06:34,280
- Give me the pipe!
- It's already fucking hot!

55
00:06:39,394 --> 00:06:40,861
I got news for you.

56
00:06:41,229 --> 00:06:44,790
It'll get a lot hotter
before the fucking night's over.

57
00:06:47,902 --> 00:06:49,529
Move the goddamn car!

58
00:06:50,972 --> 00:06:53,338
What are you doing? Get in the car!

59
00:06:53,541 --> 00:06:54,940
What's your problem?

60
00:06:55,209 --> 00:06:56,039
He'll do her.

61
00:06:56,244 --> 00:06:57,472
- Asshole.
- Asshole?

62
00:07:08,222 --> 00:07:09,553
What are you looking at?

63
00:07:17,165 --> 00:07:19,998
You got the mitt. I got the ball.
Get the bat.

64
00:07:20,234 --> 00:07:22,725
Let's go. Let's go.

65
00:07:41,022 --> 00:07:42,751
We got a problem. Can you come in?

66
00:07:42,957 --> 00:07:44,549
I'm with the kid, why?

67
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:48,855
Bobby Lupo was shot on 18th Avenue
in front of his wife and kids.

68
00:07:49,697 --> 00:07:51,358
Oh, my God!

69
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:54,024
I'm sending you a car.

70
00:08:06,481 --> 00:08:09,450
Vick, I got to send Tony over right now.

71
00:08:09,717 --> 00:08:13,813
Damn you and the job! He waits
a month for one weekend with you.

72
00:08:14,789 --> 00:08:16,950
I know,
but Bobby just got shot.

73
00:08:17,458 --> 00:08:18,948
Oh, my God!

74
00:08:19,293 --> 00:08:21,284
Laurie and the kids were with him.

75
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:26,522
l'll be right over.
Send Tony to my parents' house.

76
00:08:26,734 --> 00:08:29,032
l'll pick him up afterwards.

77
00:08:46,854 --> 00:08:49,687
Get them out of here,
Vick, please.

78
00:08:54,929 --> 00:08:56,590
Sure you want to see this?

79
00:09:01,302 --> 00:09:03,770
Give him some room, will you?
Come on!

80
00:09:05,273 --> 00:09:07,571
See if there are any more witnesses.

81
00:09:07,775 --> 00:09:09,936
All I got is this fruit and vegetable guy.

82
00:09:22,189 --> 00:09:25,181
I'm real sorry, Gino.
It was Richie Madano.

83
00:09:26,027 --> 00:09:30,123
Laurie said Richie got out of the car
and just stepped up. Bang!

84
00:09:30,631 --> 00:09:34,727
The grocer said Richie tossed something.
We didn't find nothing.

85
00:09:36,137 --> 00:09:39,106
We know every mob operation.

86
00:09:39,307 --> 00:09:40,968
We'll squeeze them
to give him up.

87
00:09:41,542 --> 00:09:46,445
Do that. But it's me who'll find
this fucking guy. You know that.

88
00:09:46,647 --> 00:09:48,205
You and Vicky...

89
00:09:48,482 --> 00:09:51,645
Divorce goes through this month.

90
00:09:52,987 --> 00:09:54,318
How'd it happen?

91
00:09:54,655 --> 00:09:57,556
Some wannabe wiseguy asshole,
Richie Madano.

92
00:09:58,526 --> 00:10:00,289
Dope dealer, dope user...

93
00:10:00,494 --> 00:10:02,985
He was a guy Bobby and Gino
grew up with.

94
00:10:03,230 --> 00:10:05,391
We don't know why he'd kill Bobby.

95
00:10:14,175 --> 00:10:17,838
- Are you all right?
- No, I'm not! He was my best friend.

96
00:10:21,382 --> 00:10:23,247
He just pulled a woman
out of a car...

97
00:10:23,484 --> 00:10:25,850
...and blew her brains out.
It looks random.

98
00:10:26,087 --> 00:10:29,250
Three of his crew were with him.
One has a tattoo on his neck.

99
00:10:29,523 --> 00:10:31,354
I know him. Bochi.

100
00:10:31,592 --> 00:10:34,425
He's a piece of shit.
Got a sheet as long as my arm.

101
00:10:35,262 --> 00:10:37,662
We got a city-wide out,
every officer.

102
00:10:37,865 --> 00:10:40,561
We got A.L. 's
at the airports, trains, buses...

103
00:10:40,768 --> 00:10:42,360
This guy won't run.

104
00:10:42,603 --> 00:10:45,538
He'll sneak and hide,
but he won't leave Brooklyn.

105
00:10:47,274 --> 00:10:50,573
l'll feed you every dope dive he's got,
but let me do it my way.

106
00:10:50,778 --> 00:10:53,110
Just give me an unmarked
and a shotgun.

107
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:04,687
Don't. You're too close.
Let other cops do it.

108
00:11:04,892 --> 00:11:07,725
I know this guy
better than anybody else.

109
00:11:07,962 --> 00:11:11,398
I know the neighborhood
better than anyone else.

110
00:11:20,341 --> 00:11:22,809
- Be careful, will you?
- You know me.

111
00:11:23,911 --> 00:11:27,074
- Get the son of a bitch.
- L'll do what I can.

112
00:11:29,583 --> 00:11:31,312
Why won't this man run?

113
00:11:31,752 --> 00:11:34,915
You never understood nothing
about the neighborhood.

114
00:11:35,356 --> 00:11:36,653
I guess not.

115
00:11:36,924 --> 00:11:40,985
You kill a cop in front of witnesses,
you're going to die.

116
00:11:41,262 --> 00:11:44,720
The difference is, this guy wants to die
in his own neighborhood.

117
00:11:45,433 --> 00:11:48,527
Why can't you all piss on a tree,
mark territory, like dogs?

118
00:11:49,170 --> 00:11:53,266
Don't worry. L'll be at
the divorce hearing on time, in 1 piece.

119
00:11:55,843 --> 00:11:59,745
l'll pick up Laurie and the girls
and bring them to our house.

120
00:12:00,014 --> 00:12:02,278
Finish this
so we can finish our business.

121
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,987
Find Richie Madano before the cops do
and bring him to me, here!

122
00:12:47,161 --> 00:12:48,560
What about Gino?

123
00:12:48,829 --> 00:12:50,888
Stay away from Gino. Leave him alone.

124
00:12:51,398 --> 00:12:52,729
Come on, go.

125
00:13:25,099 --> 00:13:26,327
Sammy, how are you?

126
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:27,862
Why are you here?

127
00:13:30,271 --> 00:13:32,000
Still comb your hair like a girl.

128
00:13:44,285 --> 00:13:46,617
Gino, I'm sorry what happened.

129
00:14:03,237 --> 00:14:06,570
My sincere regrets.
Comes from my heart.

130
00:14:14,648 --> 00:14:16,639
In front of a man's family.

131
00:14:17,251 --> 00:14:19,219
It's inhuman.
Worse than that.

132
00:14:26,594 --> 00:14:27,492
He's not with us.

133
00:14:29,663 --> 00:14:33,326
You know we never let
nobody do anything like this.

134
00:14:33,834 --> 00:14:36,325
If you or one of your people...

135
00:14:37,104 --> 00:14:38,594
...catch this guy...

136
00:14:38,839 --> 00:14:41,330
...he gets what,
seven or ten, maybe?

137
00:14:41,675 --> 00:14:42,835
If we're lucky.

138
00:14:43,444 --> 00:14:46,675
Gino, this man disgraced me. And you.

139
00:14:47,014 --> 00:14:50,415
He spilled an innocent man's blood
in front of his family!

140
00:14:50,684 --> 00:14:52,618
And on my sidewalk.

141
00:14:54,355 --> 00:14:56,084
Gino, you know our ways.

142
00:14:56,523 --> 00:14:58,684
He must be dealt with by us.

143
00:14:59,293 --> 00:15:00,692
But I promise you...

144
00:15:01,695 --> 00:15:04,687
...I will teach this man the price
of our blood.

145
00:15:10,271 --> 00:15:13,672
...God forbid I find him before
you do...

146
00:15:14,275 --> 00:15:15,401
...you know what l'll do.

147
00:15:22,182 --> 00:15:23,615
Think about it.

148
00:15:33,527 --> 00:15:34,653
All right, Gino?

149
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:41,030
Patch me through to Doz.

150
00:15:41,302 --> 00:15:42,599
10-4, switching over.

151
00:15:43,871 --> 00:15:45,202
Go ahead, talk to me.

152
00:15:46,473 --> 00:15:50,409
Vittorio doesn't know nothing.
If he does, he won't tell me.

153
00:15:51,145 --> 00:15:55,912
I'm sending over O'IKelly and some guys
from OCCB. IKeep in touch.

154
00:15:56,550 --> 00:15:59,314
- Sure, l'll keep you posted.
- Watch your ass.

155
00:16:00,988 --> 00:16:03,752
"IKill them all. Let God sort them out."
Tough guy.

156
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:21,298
Please, God...

157
00:16:21,508 --> 00:16:24,033
...let me run into this guy someday.

158
00:17:57,938 --> 00:18:01,066
I heard what happened.
Hope you get the son of a bitch.

159
00:18:01,275 --> 00:18:02,970
Me too. Six-pack of seltzer.

160
00:18:08,348 --> 00:18:10,145
Six dead Washingtons, brother.

161
00:18:15,956 --> 00:18:17,685
Never thought about it.

162
00:18:20,027 --> 00:18:21,858
We're going to call him Corragio.

163
00:18:23,964 --> 00:18:26,364
You see anything, you drop a dime.

164
00:18:26,800 --> 00:18:28,131
How's your mother?

165
00:18:28,535 --> 00:18:30,025
She's going straight now.

166
00:18:31,805 --> 00:18:33,033
Thank God.

167
00:18:44,451 --> 00:18:45,850
You want to fuck?

168
00:18:49,857 --> 00:18:52,291
Did you hear what she said?

169
00:18:52,526 --> 00:18:55,359
What'd she say, my man? What'd she say?

170
00:18:55,863 --> 00:19:00,266
I'm at Sunset Park and 3rd.
Richie's clients are all down here.

171
00:19:00,467 --> 00:19:01,764
Ain't it the truth.

172
00:19:08,142 --> 00:19:13,045
I'm looking for two hotshots for backup!
Anybody got the balls?

173
00:19:13,647 --> 00:19:15,274
Anybody got the balls?

174
00:19:15,549 --> 00:19:17,983
How about you?
You got the fucking balls?

175
00:19:18,218 --> 00:19:19,446
I got the balls.

176
00:19:19,720 --> 00:19:20,744
Now you got the bread.

177
00:19:21,221 --> 00:19:22,483
It's Gino!

178
00:19:22,890 --> 00:19:24,721
Get in the fucking car!

179
00:19:27,828 --> 00:19:29,227
Back up!

180
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,157
Get the fuck out of the way!

181
00:20:30,490 --> 00:20:31,548
Make a fucking right!

182
00:20:31,758 --> 00:20:35,558
I'm trying to lose him, for chrissakes!
Too much weight in the car!

183
00:20:41,435 --> 00:20:45,462
If you don't lose this cocksucker
I'm going to pop you first.

184
00:20:45,672 --> 00:20:46,730
This guy's good.

185
00:20:48,675 --> 00:20:50,199
You having fun yet, guys?

186
00:20:57,284 --> 00:20:58,615
Lose this fucking guy!

187
00:20:58,852 --> 00:21:01,013
You want to drive this fucking car?!

188
00:21:01,288 --> 00:21:05,520
Shut the fuck up, you hear me?!
Shut the fuck up!

189
00:21:06,627 --> 00:21:07,457
l'll get him.

190
00:21:14,468 --> 00:21:15,935
This is where we lose him.

191
00:21:17,638 --> 00:21:18,900
This is our break coming up!

192
00:21:20,140 --> 00:21:21,334
Hang on!

193
00:21:22,542 --> 00:21:23,736
Holy shit!

194
00:21:28,815 --> 00:21:30,407
Get out of the way!

195
00:21:42,396 --> 00:21:45,832
We haven't lost him yet.
Let's take him for some pork chops.

196
00:21:58,845 --> 00:21:59,869
Back up!

197
00:22:01,348 --> 00:22:03,441
Give me the merch and the bullets.

198
00:22:04,351 --> 00:22:05,648
Do what he fucking says.

199
00:22:05,852 --> 00:22:07,114
Let's get out of here.

200
00:22:09,356 --> 00:22:10,983
All right, here he is.

201
00:22:11,358 --> 00:22:14,657
I want you to hang this motherfucker
on a hook, you hear me?

202
00:22:14,895 --> 00:22:17,659
I got some scores to settle.
You 3 come with me.

203
00:22:18,165 --> 00:22:19,530
Let's go!

204
00:22:21,234 --> 00:22:22,826
Hang him up by a hook!

205
00:22:43,957 --> 00:22:45,254
We'll cut him a new ass!

206
00:22:54,901 --> 00:22:56,232
Come get some!

207
00:23:01,641 --> 00:23:02,699
Bust his head!

208
00:23:10,484 --> 00:23:14,853
Richie's a bad guy. My friends don't
like him and yours don't like him.

209
00:23:15,088 --> 00:23:16,783
You hang around
the wrong people.

210
00:23:20,861 --> 00:23:22,123
This is for you,
motherfucker!

211
00:23:22,496 --> 00:23:24,088
Don't be a bad guy.

212
00:23:24,664 --> 00:23:26,256
What you want to shoot me for?

213
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:28,724
Don't be a bad guy like that.

214
00:23:28,935 --> 00:23:30,835
Be a nice guy, all right?

215
00:23:35,776 --> 00:23:37,175
Have you seen the news?

216
00:23:38,111 --> 00:23:40,773
This fucking jerk Madano
is on the loose again.

217
00:23:42,516 --> 00:23:44,507
Made him out to be a wiseguy.

218
00:23:45,452 --> 00:23:48,444
And they connected him to us.

219
00:23:49,790 --> 00:23:53,851
That piece of shit couldn't be
a gangster if he owned New York City.

220
00:23:55,362 --> 00:23:56,522
Get him.

221
00:23:57,964 --> 00:24:00,296
We can't stand this publicity.

222
00:24:04,304 --> 00:24:05,669
l'll get him.

223
00:24:19,486 --> 00:24:21,147
You got any puppy dog food?

224
00:24:21,354 --> 00:24:23,481
Right here.
I got anything you want.

225
00:24:23,690 --> 00:24:25,658
I got this stuff here...

226
00:24:28,028 --> 00:24:30,826
Looks like he needs this.
Give him some of this.

227
00:24:31,231 --> 00:24:35,133
None of this is from Jersey, right?
I don't want no radioactive stuff.

228
00:24:35,502 --> 00:24:36,901
I don't blame you.

229
00:24:58,692 --> 00:25:00,353
What are you doing down here?

230
00:25:03,530 --> 00:25:05,157
How you doing?

231
00:25:05,398 --> 00:25:06,865
It's okay.

232
00:25:07,100 --> 00:25:10,194
- I heard you got your license.
- What'd I get, a dog license?

233
00:25:10,704 --> 00:25:12,604
I heard you just got your button.

234
00:25:14,541 --> 00:25:16,236
You're still a dirtbag criminal.

235
00:25:16,443 --> 00:25:20,470
You know how many cops I know that
make my guys look like altar boys?

236
00:25:21,448 --> 00:25:23,040
Ain't it the truth.

237
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,541
Sad world we live in.

238
00:25:26,453 --> 00:25:28,421
It's our world. It's our system.

239
00:25:28,622 --> 00:25:32,058
- What, I got to hear this again?
- Come on, we got to do this.

240
00:25:35,095 --> 00:25:36,960
Ever since we was little...

241
00:25:37,464 --> 00:25:39,796
...I never, ever tried to, like,
you know...

242
00:25:40,066 --> 00:25:43,297
...act 1 ike I was better than you
at anything. And I never was.

243
00:25:43,637 --> 00:25:47,300
You called me "lucky." I wasn't
lucky, man, it was just deep desire.

244
00:25:47,574 --> 00:25:50,975
I was always willing to do whatever
it took to get the job done.

245
00:25:51,244 --> 00:25:52,643
You know, this thing...

246
00:25:53,413 --> 00:25:58,146
You think it's the department. I don't
give a fuck about the department.

247
00:25:59,152 --> 00:26:01,279
This, to me, is personal.

248
00:26:04,491 --> 00:26:05,958
You'll never change, Gino.

249
00:26:14,768 --> 00:26:16,429
Come on, let's get out of here.

250
00:26:33,787 --> 00:26:35,687
Aw, fuck me!

251
00:26:36,623 --> 00:26:38,113
Where is he?

252
00:26:38,358 --> 00:26:41,088
- I don't know.
- You haven't seen or heard from him?

253
00:26:41,294 --> 00:26:44,457
Come on, he's my brother.
l'll see him sooner or later.

254
00:26:44,698 --> 00:26:46,996
He's crazy, sticking that crap
up his nose.

255
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,830
I knew this would happen.
l'll call you, on my mother's eyes.

256
00:26:52,372 --> 00:26:56,468
Find him. Otherwise, next time we
come here, you're coming with us.

257
00:27:08,054 --> 00:27:10,818
I need them.
I need this shit, right?

258
00:27:11,057 --> 00:27:12,718
Nicki, coffee.

259
00:27:35,081 --> 00:27:35,979
He's not here.

260
00:27:36,383 --> 00:27:38,943
Mr. Madano, how's your health?

261
00:27:39,252 --> 00:27:40,617
I said, he's not here.

262
00:27:41,021 --> 00:27:42,352
I believe you.

263
00:27:43,323 --> 00:27:46,053
But if you don't mind,
I'd like to talk to you.

264
00:28:24,831 --> 00:28:26,059
He killed Bobby.

265
00:28:26,633 --> 00:28:28,294
In front of his wife and kids.

266
00:28:28,501 --> 00:28:29,627
What did Bobby do to him?

267
00:28:29,836 --> 00:28:31,497
Bobby didn't do nothing.

268
00:28:31,838 --> 00:28:33,829
What did the police do
to make him crazy?

269
00:28:34,107 --> 00:28:36,769
Two blocks over, he just killed
another woman, random!

270
00:28:37,277 --> 00:28:39,336
Something make him crazy.

271
00:28:40,280 --> 00:28:44,239
Bobby's children watched Richie
kill their father.

272
00:28:45,752 --> 00:28:47,515
Now, you know as well as I do...

273
00:28:47,721 --> 00:28:50,713
...Richie was always into bad things,
even when we were kids.

274
00:28:50,924 --> 00:28:52,391
But never crazy like this.

275
00:28:52,592 --> 00:28:54,617
He's on drugs now.
He's lost his mind.

276
00:28:54,828 --> 00:28:56,523
Now, if you've seen Richie...

277
00:28:57,630 --> 00:29:00,724
...or you know something
I don't, you better tell me.

278
00:29:07,173 --> 00:29:09,471
When I came here...

279
00:29:09,676 --> 00:29:11,405
...I got a job repairing the subway.

280
00:29:13,379 --> 00:29:15,870
Same house, same job, ever since.

281
00:29:16,750 --> 00:29:18,980
I come home for dinner every night.

282
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:21,644
Almost 50 years.

283
00:29:22,856 --> 00:29:24,050
And you don't believe me?

284
00:29:24,257 --> 00:29:25,554
I believe you.

285
00:29:26,392 --> 00:29:28,860
And even then,
when I was a punk kid...

286
00:29:29,062 --> 00:29:31,223
...I believed you and you believed me.

287
00:29:33,666 --> 00:29:35,930
How can I keep you from killing my son?

288
00:29:37,370 --> 00:29:39,338
You tell Richie to get a lawyer.

289
00:29:40,840 --> 00:29:42,808
Have him turn himself in.

290
00:29:44,377 --> 00:29:45,309
If not...

291
00:29:46,045 --> 00:29:47,603
...l'm going to kill him.

292
00:30:20,313 --> 00:30:21,541
"Just..."

293
00:30:24,617 --> 00:30:26,608
"...in time..."

294
00:30:28,688 --> 00:30:30,053
Open the door.

295
00:30:32,625 --> 00:30:34,115
How you two doing?

296
00:30:36,396 --> 00:30:40,389
Rica, I ain't seen you around
in a while, you know?

297
00:30:41,401 --> 00:30:44,063
What'd you do,
retire or something?

298
00:30:45,238 --> 00:30:47,604
I guess you could say I retired.

299
00:30:47,874 --> 00:30:49,637
Got a job at the video store.

300
00:30:53,313 --> 00:30:55,975
- Just trying to get back to normal.
- Normal?

301
00:30:57,617 --> 00:30:59,482
What do you mean by "normal"?

302
00:31:00,320 --> 00:31:04,950
What'd you do, Rica? What'd you do?
you just say no?

303
00:31:05,258 --> 00:31:09,661
What are you, what's-her-name,
Nancy-fucking-Reabush?

304
00:31:09,996 --> 00:31:12,260
No, Rich,
it's not like that.

305
00:31:21,774 --> 00:31:24,106
You wouldn't "just say no"
to me, would you?

306
00:31:47,700 --> 00:31:48,962
How you doing?

307
00:31:49,202 --> 00:31:52,467
Officer Big Shot,
come to bust my balls?

308
00:31:52,772 --> 00:31:56,037
This here is a detective!
In what, narcotics now?

309
00:31:57,143 --> 00:31:59,373
Now I want you all
to be very nice.

310
00:31:59,579 --> 00:32:02,514
Tell this fucking mamaluke
anything he wants to know.

311
00:32:02,715 --> 00:32:04,342
Vinnie, come over here.

312
00:32:04,617 --> 00:32:09,145
You shouldn't talk to me that way.
We don't know each other so good.

313
00:32:09,389 --> 00:32:13,120
You were still sucking your thumb
when Richie was sucking dicks.

314
00:32:13,326 --> 00:32:15,294
But still, you shouldn't
talk so tough.

315
00:32:15,495 --> 00:32:17,725
If Richie was here
you wouldn't talk that shit.

316
00:32:18,097 --> 00:32:21,032
But he's not here.
You know why he's not here?

317
00:32:21,267 --> 00:32:24,896
Because he's a chickenshit
fucking pussy asshole.

318
00:32:26,806 --> 00:32:29,741
Don't go pushing my patrons around,
you prick.

319
00:32:30,076 --> 00:32:33,170
Prick? Look around.
Is this the setting for profanity?

320
00:32:34,047 --> 00:32:35,071
Fuck you!

321
00:32:36,115 --> 00:32:38,413
Benny the Book.
How are you, buddy?

322
00:32:40,753 --> 00:32:43,813
You wouldn't be here using Ma Bell
for illegal means?

323
00:32:44,457 --> 00:32:46,482
Bookmaking's an illegal activity.

324
00:32:46,859 --> 00:32:50,818
You also wouldn't know Richie owns this
place and sells narcotics here.

325
00:32:51,030 --> 00:32:54,431
Because he's a fucking puke
who likes to pervert kids.

326
00:32:54,701 --> 00:32:56,498
Drugs?
Nobody uses drugs around here.

327
00:32:58,538 --> 00:33:00,199
You don't know nothing, do you?

328
00:33:06,612 --> 00:33:08,102
Anybody seen Richie?

329
00:33:10,783 --> 00:33:13,616
Anyone know why Richie did Bobby Lupo?

330
00:33:16,389 --> 00:33:17,481
I don't know cazzo.

331
00:33:19,826 --> 00:33:21,350
Big man with a badge and gun.

332
00:33:23,029 --> 00:33:24,223
What's the password,
asshole?

333
00:33:27,800 --> 00:33:29,290
What are you doing here?

334
00:33:30,303 --> 00:33:32,669
- Aren't you Vito's friend?
- I got lots of friends.

335
00:33:32,872 --> 00:33:35,067
You jump around a little bit.
Is that it?

336
00:33:35,475 --> 00:33:37,966
Who's this one over here,
your girlfriend?

337
00:33:40,179 --> 00:33:41,737
You know what, Cool Breeze?

338
00:33:42,148 --> 00:33:46,244
Someday your wise mouth is going to get
your body in a lot of trouble.

339
00:33:46,486 --> 00:33:49,046
- Where you from, finocchi?
- Attica.

340
00:33:49,255 --> 00:33:52,622
You couldn't be from Brooklyn,
because we don't talk like that.

341
00:33:52,825 --> 00:33:55,817
Tattoo, this guy's nothing
without that badge and gun.

342
00:33:56,429 --> 00:33:59,830
You can't come back here.
Get the fuck out of here!

343
00:34:05,171 --> 00:34:08,334
What do we got here?
What is this shit?

344
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:15,670
Whose hot dog is this?
ls that yours?

345
00:34:16,015 --> 00:34:18,575
Without that badge and gun,
you'd be dead.

346
00:34:18,785 --> 00:34:20,685
Get the fuck out of here!

347
00:34:22,021 --> 00:34:24,114
I've noticed a lot of
boxing memorabilia.

348
00:34:24,490 --> 00:34:27,288
We got some gloves over here.

349
00:34:27,627 --> 00:34:30,289
Pictures everywhere. Who's the boxer?

350
00:34:30,863 --> 00:34:33,127
You're the boxer?
You a tough guy?

351
00:34:33,533 --> 00:34:36,593
- Tough enough.
- Really? What could you do?

352
00:34:36,803 --> 00:34:37,792
To you?

353
00:34:44,477 --> 00:34:47,310
I'm starting to get in a bad mood.

354
00:34:47,647 --> 00:34:52,175
Maybe it's a mood swing, my hormones,
or a need to impose my will.

355
00:34:52,385 --> 00:34:55,877
I want you tell these finocchis
to get on the fucking table.

356
00:34:57,824 --> 00:35:00,725
Tell them to get up on
the fucking table.

357
00:35:01,494 --> 00:35:05,362
Are you totally nuts?!
You could've killed somebody upstairs!

358
00:35:05,598 --> 00:35:08,226
- But there's nobody upstairs!
- How would you know?

359
00:35:08,501 --> 00:35:09,991
Did you bust in the joint?

360
00:35:12,205 --> 00:35:13,365
I don't recall.

361
00:35:13,573 --> 00:35:16,406
The only balls he has
is that badge and gun.

362
00:35:24,984 --> 00:35:26,417
Here's my gun!

363
00:35:26,853 --> 00:35:30,414
Fair game now, okay?
And here's my badge!

364
00:35:31,023 --> 00:35:33,787
This is your trophy.
This is your trophy, okay?

365
00:35:33,993 --> 00:35:35,585
Come and get it.

366
00:35:36,395 --> 00:35:38,488
Tell one of your citriolis
to come and get it.

367
00:35:38,731 --> 00:35:41,325
I offer 5000 for that badge,
right now.

368
00:35:45,204 --> 00:35:46,865
Anybody see Richie?

369
00:35:47,607 --> 00:35:50,508
Anybody know why
Richie did Bobby Lupo?

370
00:35:52,211 --> 00:35:54,441
Fuckface, you want to get by me?

371
00:35:54,714 --> 00:35:58,707
There's only two things stopping you:
fear and common sense.

372
00:35:59,018 --> 00:36:00,952
And l'll cut
your fucking head off!

373
00:36:11,097 --> 00:36:13,565
You motherfucker!
You knocked my teeth out!

374
00:36:15,701 --> 00:36:17,430
Hey, Sticks, come on!

375
00:36:56,676 --> 00:36:57,540
Motherfucker!

376
00:37:11,857 --> 00:37:13,017
I'm with Vittorio.

377
00:37:13,392 --> 00:37:15,622
So that means you can't touch me.

378
00:37:18,130 --> 00:37:19,961
That's right. I forgot.

379
00:37:27,073 --> 00:37:28,472
How you doing, buddy?

380
00:37:29,041 --> 00:37:33,205
- I want to talk to your brother.
- He'll want to talk to you.

381
00:37:34,380 --> 00:37:36,371
What are you doing?
You don't want to do that!

382
00:37:38,417 --> 00:37:41,443
Tell him l'll cut off his head
and piss down his throat.

383
00:37:41,654 --> 00:37:42,586
Fuck you!

384
00:37:56,535 --> 00:37:58,469
Anybody seen Richie?

385
00:38:00,740 --> 00:38:04,904
I'm going to keep coming back until
somebody remembers seeing Richie!

386
00:40:36,395 --> 00:40:37,555
So what's the latest?

387
00:40:37,897 --> 00:40:41,162
The cops are all over town,
hitting every business we own.

388
00:40:41,367 --> 00:40:43,358
All my guys
are looking for this bastard.

389
00:40:44,069 --> 00:40:47,004
Vittorio, he's killing people
like it was free.

390
00:40:47,306 --> 00:40:49,706
When I'm through,
I'm going to Cono's for dinner.

391
00:40:49,909 --> 00:40:51,308
You find Gino.

392
00:40:51,577 --> 00:40:54,341
Tell him to...
Ask him to meet me there.

393
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:57,007
And you find Richie.
I don't care how.

394
00:40:57,917 --> 00:40:59,179
You just find him.

395
00:40:59,652 --> 00:41:01,142
l'll find him.

396
00:41:06,959 --> 00:41:09,655
- Tell Joey about the mouse.
- What mouse?

397
00:41:09,962 --> 00:41:13,363
- Why, is Joey an exterminator now?
- What about the mouse?

398
00:41:13,632 --> 00:41:17,693
I got a mouse in my house. I pay $800
so I can chase a mouse around.

399
00:41:17,970 --> 00:41:19,267
Shoot this rat bastard.

400
00:41:19,472 --> 00:41:22,930
The mouse is about this fucking big.
I'm going to shoot him?

401
00:41:23,142 --> 00:41:25,201
Shoot him through the floor,
you kill a neighbor.

402
00:41:25,978 --> 00:41:27,969
Let's go by Chas the Chair.

403
00:41:28,514 --> 00:41:30,778
I think the mouse
is smarter than you are.

404
00:41:30,983 --> 00:41:34,111
- Shoot this rat.
- Shut up about the fucking mouse!

405
00:41:42,995 --> 00:41:44,792
Thanks for coming.

406
00:41:44,997 --> 00:41:47,397
- Pull up a chair.
- Sit where I can see you.

407
00:41:53,672 --> 00:41:56,334
What are your guys...?
Busting my balls all over town?

408
00:41:56,575 --> 00:41:59,567
Hurting my business.
That ain't right, Gino.

409
00:42:00,579 --> 00:42:04,913
Well, you know, Vittorio,
I was meaning to tell you...

410
00:42:05,251 --> 00:42:06,912
...I really don't like you.

411
00:42:08,354 --> 00:42:09,981
And I never really did.

412
00:42:10,189 --> 00:42:14,353
If you fall off a cliff or get arrested,
rot in jail for life...

413
00:42:14,593 --> 00:42:17,084
...I really don't care, all right?

414
00:42:21,934 --> 00:42:24,425
I'm sorry about what happened to Bobby.

415
00:42:25,004 --> 00:42:26,232
I know how you loved him.

416
00:42:26,605 --> 00:42:29,369
But I know you don't mean
one word you just said.

417
00:42:30,943 --> 00:42:32,342
You're one of us.

418
00:42:32,578 --> 00:42:33,510
Family.

419
00:42:35,881 --> 00:42:37,371
Let me tell you something.

420
00:42:37,783 --> 00:42:40,775
I'm not one of you,
and I'm not with you.

421
00:42:52,298 --> 00:42:54,061
Gino, wait up.

422
00:42:57,403 --> 00:42:59,268
Why you talking to the old man
like that?

423
00:42:59,471 --> 00:43:02,907
Because he's your boss, not mine.
You know what I'm saying?

424
00:43:03,108 --> 00:43:04,735
I want to tell you something.

425
00:43:05,311 --> 00:43:07,074
You remember Uncle Pino, right?

426
00:43:07,646 --> 00:43:09,307
Yeah. The big guy.

427
00:43:09,582 --> 00:43:10,913
One time...

428
00:43:11,483 --> 00:43:15,647
...when I was a kid, Pino was going to
take me to the movies.

429
00:43:16,255 --> 00:43:19,281
First, we go to the candy store.
Mettiamo's, remember it?

430
00:43:19,491 --> 00:43:20,651
Who the hell could forget?

431
00:43:20,993 --> 00:43:23,985
We see this guy filling up his pockets
with this and that.

432
00:43:24,330 --> 00:43:25,763
Pino grabs him by the throat...

433
00:43:25,998 --> 00:43:28,592
...drags him outside,
throws him a beating.

434
00:43:30,369 --> 00:43:34,169
Puts him in the trunk of the car,
drives to the movies.

435
00:43:34,440 --> 00:43:35,930
He went to the movies?

436
00:43:37,676 --> 00:43:41,112
In the movies, I'm not watching.
I'm thinking to myself:

437
00:43:41,347 --> 00:43:44,180
"What about this guy in the trunk?"

438
00:43:46,285 --> 00:43:50,278
I think to myself,
"He killed him. He's dead."

439
00:43:50,522 --> 00:43:52,922
I run to Pino, I says,
"You killed the guy."

440
00:43:53,192 --> 00:43:56,855
Pino's bored, brings me around the front,
gives me the keys, he says:

441
00:43:57,196 --> 00:43:58,857
"Do what you got to do."

442
00:43:59,198 --> 00:44:02,031
I says, "Me? What am I going to do?
I'm nine years old."

443
00:44:02,635 --> 00:44:05,468
He gives me the keys.
I open the trunk.

444
00:44:05,671 --> 00:44:08,265
- I see a man staring at me.
- You must've been scared.

445
00:44:08,540 --> 00:44:10,872
I've got Pino over here.
What am I scared of?

446
00:44:11,143 --> 00:44:14,704
I says to the guy,
"Hey you, get the fuck out of here!"

447
00:44:16,048 --> 00:44:18,573
I blink. He's in Hoboken.

448
00:44:18,784 --> 00:44:19,773
He took off like a shot?

449
00:44:19,985 --> 00:44:21,350
Like a bird.

450
00:44:21,553 --> 00:44:23,145
You scared the shit out of him.

451
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:26,022
The son of a bitch.

452
00:44:27,559 --> 00:44:31,222
Nine years old, I'm looking at Pino,
I'm thinking to myself:

453
00:44:31,497 --> 00:44:33,556
"My God, what a great guy."

454
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,161
I always wanted to be a wiseguy.

455
00:44:37,403 --> 00:44:39,394
Look at us now, under God.

456
00:44:39,905 --> 00:44:42,897
Who'd have thought that
I would've become a cop?

457
00:44:43,509 --> 00:44:44,908
Hey, Lucky, you know...

458
00:44:46,412 --> 00:44:48,346
...to me God's a puppeteer.

459
00:44:49,581 --> 00:44:51,845
We're on the end of the strings.

460
00:44:52,084 --> 00:44:55,178
But God has a strange sense of humor,
you got to admit.

461
00:44:56,588 --> 00:44:57,919
Maybe you're right.

462
00:45:18,544 --> 00:45:21,877
Richie, judging by
your sudden rise to stardom...

463
00:45:22,114 --> 00:45:25,208
...l'll lay odds this one's
got a make on it by now.

464
00:45:25,451 --> 00:45:28,215
Richie, don't!
Don't! What are you doing?

465
00:45:29,455 --> 00:45:30,945
I'm an overnight success, baby.

466
00:45:31,223 --> 00:45:35,091
I'm going to crib here for
a couple hours. Any problem with that?

467
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:13,057
How do I know that thing's real?

468
00:46:13,332 --> 00:46:17,132
Don't I look like an honest guy?
How bad do you want to find out?

469
00:46:26,278 --> 00:46:29,441
Tell her I'm here,
then get the fuck out of my sight.

470
00:46:32,618 --> 00:46:33,482
How you doing?

471
00:46:33,752 --> 00:46:35,913
You want to tell me
how you got up here?

472
00:46:36,121 --> 00:46:39,955
- Where's Richie?
- I don't know nothing from nothing.

473
00:46:40,192 --> 00:46:41,523
Is that right?

474
00:46:48,634 --> 00:46:50,033
Here's your drink.

475
00:46:50,369 --> 00:46:51,427
I didn't order no drink.

476
00:46:59,411 --> 00:47:01,879
Cops have been
in and out of here all night.

477
00:47:02,080 --> 00:47:03,980
But it's you I been expecting.

478
00:47:04,216 --> 00:47:06,844
IKind of figured you'd save
the best for yourself.

479
00:47:07,119 --> 00:47:08,051
How you doing?

480
00:47:08,387 --> 00:47:10,981
I can still get it wet.
How about you?

481
00:47:11,323 --> 00:47:12,312
Me?

482
00:47:12,858 --> 00:47:14,849
I can't believe you eat
with that mouth.

483
00:47:18,697 --> 00:47:20,289
I feel bad about Bobby.

484
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:24,332
You don't know
what reason your brother had?

485
00:47:24,570 --> 00:47:26,868
Even if I knew, which I don't...

486
00:47:27,072 --> 00:47:29,131
And you haven't seen your brother.
Right?

487
00:47:29,341 --> 00:47:31,400
Last time was a couple of days ago.

488
00:47:31,844 --> 00:47:35,245
He's always with a different whore.
Who's his latest special?

489
00:47:35,447 --> 00:47:37,972
Since when do I keep track
of my brother's pumps?

490
00:47:38,250 --> 00:47:39,740
Must be tough.

491
00:47:42,254 --> 00:47:44,188
- Who's this one over here?
- Which one?

492
00:47:44,423 --> 00:47:46,755
The one with nipples
you could dial a phone with.

493
00:47:47,259 --> 00:47:48,419
Terry.

494
00:47:49,194 --> 00:47:49,956
Why?

495
00:47:50,362 --> 00:47:52,887
Let's cut the bullshit.
I got to talk to you.

496
00:47:53,098 --> 00:47:55,293
Would you get
your fucking hands off me?

497
00:47:55,500 --> 00:47:57,593
Don't push me around in my club!

498
00:47:58,103 --> 00:47:59,832
What the fuck you think you're doing?

499
00:48:00,038 --> 00:48:01,903
Didn't I tell you to get
out of here?

500
00:48:04,877 --> 00:48:07,243
Are you getting your rocks off this way?

501
00:48:07,446 --> 00:48:10,415
Is this what they teach you to do
when you're a cop? Shit!

502
00:48:10,616 --> 00:48:12,345
Have you seen your brother anywhere?

503
00:48:12,551 --> 00:48:16,009
No, I haven't.
I've told you a million times.

504
00:48:16,221 --> 00:48:18,416
What the flying fuck
you think you're doing?

505
00:48:18,624 --> 00:48:20,216
Have you seen your brother anywhere?

506
00:48:20,425 --> 00:48:22,359
Are you stupid?
I already told you "no."

507
00:48:22,895 --> 00:48:25,227
Why don't you just destroy
my whole office?

508
00:48:25,631 --> 00:48:28,293
If you're looking for my lipstick,
it's in my bag.

509
00:48:33,305 --> 00:48:35,296
I've had enough of this.

510
00:48:37,309 --> 00:48:39,675
Look what I found.
You got a gun.

511
00:48:39,878 --> 00:48:42,005
- I got a license for that.
- Where is it?

512
00:48:42,214 --> 00:48:43,408
My dog ate it.

513
00:48:43,615 --> 00:48:46,413
Let me tell you, this is a year
in jail. Sullivan Act.

514
00:48:46,652 --> 00:48:48,586
You think a year's a piece of cake?

515
00:48:48,921 --> 00:48:50,946
- Aren't you smart.
- Look, it's getting late.

516
00:48:51,423 --> 00:48:56,122
All night I've been running into people
who are deaf, dumb and blind.

517
00:48:56,328 --> 00:48:59,092
IKnow what I'm going to do?
I'm going to arrest you.

518
00:49:00,465 --> 00:49:02,228
You're going to arrest me?
For what?

519
00:49:02,434 --> 00:49:03,423
How does it work?

520
00:49:03,635 --> 00:49:06,661
I give you a little head
and you forget the whole thing?

521
00:49:07,139 --> 00:49:09,630
It won't make me forget.
You were never that good.

522
00:49:09,841 --> 00:49:12,002
Go fuck yourself, Gino.

523
00:49:12,210 --> 00:49:13,336
You're under arrest.

524
00:49:16,949 --> 00:49:18,940
I'm going to be needing
a new go-cart.

525
00:49:20,018 --> 00:49:21,849
Something with some stomp.

526
00:49:22,621 --> 00:49:23,645
And a scanner.

527
00:49:24,022 --> 00:49:27,514
Where the fuck are your manners?
The man's talking to you.

528
00:49:30,963 --> 00:49:34,421
There's a GNX over on the top floor,
on the parking garage.

529
00:49:34,633 --> 00:49:38,626
Bay 10. Take the scanner,
wire it, bring it back.

530
00:49:40,973 --> 00:49:43,806
We're going to have us a little party.

531
00:49:44,109 --> 00:49:46,543
We'll have a little party,
a little soiree.

532
00:49:48,413 --> 00:49:49,471
Bite off a couple chicks.

533
00:49:50,048 --> 00:49:52,642
We can all get laid, get blowjobs.

534
00:49:53,719 --> 00:49:58,053
Hey, Richie, you know I haven't gotten
no pussy since 1969.

535
00:50:00,826 --> 00:50:02,817
You ain't got any pussy since 1969?

536
00:50:03,028 --> 00:50:05,656
What've you been doing?
Jerkin' the gherkin?

537
00:50:07,399 --> 00:50:10,493
Come on, man. That's cold.
Leave him alone.

538
00:50:11,503 --> 00:50:13,562
What've you been doing?

539
00:50:16,708 --> 00:50:19,404
Bobby Arms. Get me a beer.

540
00:50:21,179 --> 00:50:23,147
You don't have to push me.

541
00:50:23,348 --> 00:50:25,043
Usually when you're arrested
you can use a phone.

542
00:50:25,584 --> 00:50:27,245
Are you kidding?

543
00:50:30,455 --> 00:50:33,424
You have not even told me
what I've been arrested for.

544
00:50:33,925 --> 00:50:36,587
Let me see here. What could we do?

545
00:50:36,928 --> 00:50:39,419
How about 240.25?

546
00:50:41,533 --> 00:50:42,557
Prostitution, honey.

547
00:50:43,035 --> 00:50:44,502
Are you fucking kidding me?!

548
00:50:44,803 --> 00:50:46,270
Let me out of here right now!

549
00:50:46,605 --> 00:50:48,596
I told you I was going to do this.

550
00:50:49,608 --> 00:50:51,872
What?
Are you out of your fucking mind?

551
00:50:52,077 --> 00:50:54,671
I told you I was not kidding.

552
00:50:54,880 --> 00:50:56,780
Now, how's your memory?

553
00:50:57,215 --> 00:50:58,341
Who is Roxanne?

554
00:50:58,917 --> 00:51:01,078
You are really starting
to piss me off.

555
00:51:01,953 --> 00:51:04,251
Did you ever find this one
on the street?

556
00:51:04,456 --> 00:51:05,423
Many times.

557
00:51:05,624 --> 00:51:07,182
- How much was she?
- $ 10.

558
00:51:07,392 --> 00:51:09,189
Ten bucks this, friend.

559
00:51:09,394 --> 00:51:11,794
Fuck you!
I can't believe you're doing this.

560
00:51:11,997 --> 00:51:15,262
I'm kind of disappointed.
I thought you could get at least 15.

561
00:51:17,469 --> 00:51:20,461
Gino, you fuck! Get me out of here!

562
00:51:27,479 --> 00:51:29,743
Come on, Chas. Have another drink.

563
00:51:38,190 --> 00:51:40,420
What's the story with you and that cop?

564
00:51:42,994 --> 00:51:44,655
Who? Gino?

565
00:51:46,731 --> 00:51:49,894
The one you popped.
Was that business?

566
00:51:50,335 --> 00:51:51,996
Or was it personal?

567
00:51:55,774 --> 00:51:57,173
It was personal business.

568
00:52:02,914 --> 00:52:04,108
Holy shit!

569
00:52:04,316 --> 00:52:06,841
Why are you fucking asking me
about my business?

570
00:52:07,119 --> 00:52:08,848
Richie, cops!
Cops!

571
00:52:09,621 --> 00:52:10,815
You rat me out?

572
00:52:11,189 --> 00:52:12,156
Never.

573
00:52:12,357 --> 00:52:13,255
You rat bastard!

574
00:52:13,625 --> 00:52:15,115
I'd never rat you out.

575
00:52:16,294 --> 00:52:17,784
l'll put you out of your misery.

576
00:52:18,130 --> 00:52:19,427
Please, don't!

577
00:52:29,941 --> 00:52:31,033
- Hands up!
- Nobody move!

578
00:52:32,210 --> 00:52:36,010
I don't believe it! Why did
you shoot him? He didn't rat us out.

579
00:53:36,274 --> 00:53:37,172
How you doing?

580
00:53:37,375 --> 00:53:40,708
You only arrest Patricia
because she no help you find Richie.

581
00:53:41,046 --> 00:53:44,607
Just the same, maybe you could come in
and we'll talk a minute.

582
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:50,951
If you'd sit down
right over here.

583
00:54:03,401 --> 00:54:05,631
This is difficult for me to say.

584
00:54:06,304 --> 00:54:08,864
I'm sorry for the way I behaved
in your home.

585
00:54:09,074 --> 00:54:10,200
I know it was disrespectful.

586
00:54:10,408 --> 00:54:12,569
You always been like a father to me.

587
00:54:14,145 --> 00:54:15,806
If you tell me...

588
00:54:16,648 --> 00:54:20,049
...that you haven't seen Richie,
I believe you. We got problems.

589
00:54:24,756 --> 00:54:26,314
I know that it's...

590
00:54:26,758 --> 00:54:28,988
No man wants to bury his son.

591
00:54:30,996 --> 00:54:32,258
And I know...

592
00:54:32,931 --> 00:54:35,195
...no man wants to admit that his son...

593
00:54:35,400 --> 00:54:37,800
...has become something
the world can do without.

594
00:54:39,871 --> 00:54:41,498
But I'm very afraid...

595
00:54:43,008 --> 00:54:45,841
...every moment, for everyone
around us.

596
00:54:48,013 --> 00:54:49,446
I pray...

597
00:54:50,181 --> 00:54:51,944
...for this to end.

598
00:54:54,519 --> 00:54:56,510
I know what you're trying to say.

599
00:55:08,667 --> 00:55:10,362
I'm going to have to...

600
00:55:11,636 --> 00:55:13,501
...make you stay downtown tonight.

601
00:55:30,055 --> 00:55:33,115
Jerry, that's robbery,
not narcotics.

602
00:55:34,292 --> 00:55:37,284
Talk to Donziger and get back to me.

603
00:55:37,896 --> 00:55:39,295
l'll talk to you.

604
00:55:56,548 --> 00:55:58,413
Does this look familiar?

605
00:56:07,058 --> 00:56:08,889
I can't.
I help you any way, he'll kill me.

606
00:56:09,427 --> 00:56:11,122
Come on.
He's your own brother!

607
00:56:11,329 --> 00:56:14,594
He's a vacuum.
He sucks up 3 to 4 grams a pass.

608
00:56:14,799 --> 00:56:17,199
That much crack doesn't promote
rational thought.

609
00:56:18,269 --> 00:56:20,499
It'll get worse than I been telling you.

610
00:56:20,705 --> 00:56:22,639
I got your father under arrest.

611
00:56:22,841 --> 00:56:24,638
It won't work, Gino!

612
00:56:24,843 --> 00:56:27,038
God!
Why don't you understand this?

613
00:56:28,513 --> 00:56:30,037
We can't help you.

614
00:56:30,248 --> 00:56:32,478
If he even thinks we did,
he'll kill Pop too.

615
00:56:32,684 --> 00:56:33,673
He's that far gone?

616
00:56:33,885 --> 00:56:35,614
Believe it, Gino.

617
00:56:36,354 --> 00:56:37,616
Anybody.

618
00:56:38,156 --> 00:56:41,387
Then I'm going to keep you here
tonight and keep you alive.

619
00:56:41,593 --> 00:56:43,083
Hate me tomorrow.

620
00:56:50,702 --> 00:56:52,260
In the 8-0 precinct.

621
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:57,100
Signal 1013. Police officer shot.
6835 Amboy Street.

622
00:56:57,709 --> 00:57:01,702
This is one night this town ain't never
going to forget about.

623
00:57:02,046 --> 00:57:04,674
Ask me, I think you already
made sure of that.

624
00:57:04,883 --> 00:57:08,876
Your wife's called couple times.
She's at your apartment with Tony.

625
00:57:09,087 --> 00:57:11,555
Any chance you can swing over there
for a minute?

626
00:57:13,258 --> 00:57:15,488
I could do that.
I'm right in the area.

627
00:57:18,329 --> 00:57:20,991
Come over here. Come here.

628
00:57:24,736 --> 00:57:28,069
I almost forgot about you.

629
00:57:28,740 --> 00:57:32,232
I got to get you
a nice hot bath, some food.

630
00:57:32,744 --> 00:57:35,338
Maybe a girlfriend or something.

631
00:57:59,103 --> 00:57:59,933
How's Tony?

632
00:58:00,305 --> 00:58:01,135
He's fine.

633
00:58:04,042 --> 00:58:05,202
Did you eat?

634
00:58:05,610 --> 00:58:07,805
A couple of dog biscuits.

635
00:58:08,012 --> 00:58:09,980
- This is my new dog.
- Look at you.

636
00:58:11,449 --> 00:58:13,974
- A police dog?
- This is Corragio.

637
00:58:15,053 --> 00:58:15,985
Are you keeping him?

638
00:58:16,287 --> 00:58:17,879
I'm thinking about it.

639
00:58:19,057 --> 00:58:21,719
Maybe.
It depends on how brave he is.

640
00:58:24,395 --> 00:58:26,158
I'd better go and see Tony.

641
00:58:30,802 --> 00:58:32,667
You want to come up
for an espresso?

642
00:58:33,238 --> 00:58:35,399
Yeah. Why not?

643
00:58:36,407 --> 00:58:38,568
You stay there and be a good boy.

644
00:58:42,247 --> 00:58:45,876
- Should we show the dog to Tony?
- He'll never go back to sleep.

645
00:58:46,784 --> 00:58:48,718
Did you ever have a dog
when you were little?

646
00:58:50,588 --> 00:58:52,920
We didn't have enough money
to feed ourselves.

647
00:58:53,191 --> 00:58:57,150
There was this old man who came
to the neighborhood when we were kids.

648
00:58:58,596 --> 00:59:00,587
He was from the old country.

649
00:59:01,099 --> 00:59:03,260
He carried an old school bell.

650
00:59:03,601 --> 00:59:08,163
He pulled along a sharpening machine
operated by a foot peddle.

651
00:59:10,775 --> 00:59:14,609
The neighbors used to get
their knives and scissors sharpened.

652
00:59:14,846 --> 00:59:16,780
A dime here, a quarter there.

653
00:59:17,448 --> 00:59:19,279
But it was an honest living.

654
00:59:19,784 --> 00:59:21,274
Time goes on...

655
00:59:21,519 --> 00:59:23,248
...people start buying...

656
00:59:23,454 --> 00:59:26,116
...disposable scissors and knives.

657
00:59:26,858 --> 00:59:28,883
Fewer and fewer people come out.

658
00:59:29,527 --> 00:59:31,188
I always used to think to myself...

659
00:59:31,796 --> 00:59:33,821
...how it would feel to leave...

660
00:59:34,032 --> 00:59:35,693
...before light...

661
00:59:36,301 --> 00:59:38,030
...and come back after dark...

662
00:59:38,303 --> 00:59:42,535
...with nothing to show your wife
and family for what you've done.

663
00:59:45,476 --> 00:59:49,173
That bell was the loneliest sound
I ever heard.

664
00:59:51,282 --> 00:59:53,079
He was your father, wasn't he?

665
00:59:55,820 --> 00:59:59,551
I remember one time I followed
the old man for a whole summer...

666
00:59:59,791 --> 01:00:01,019
...every day...

667
01:00:01,292 --> 01:00:02,816
...day in, day out.

668
01:00:05,163 --> 01:00:08,826
And after a while,
it started to grind him down.

669
01:00:10,501 --> 01:00:13,163
Nobody, nobody needs him, you know?

670
01:00:14,172 --> 01:00:16,436
If you feel like nobody needs you...

671
01:00:17,508 --> 01:00:19,339
...and you feel useless...

672
01:00:23,781 --> 01:00:25,339
...you die inside.

673
01:00:29,020 --> 01:00:30,851
You let yourself go.

674
01:00:32,290 --> 01:00:35,817
We always used to tell everybody,
"Pop died from cancer."

675
01:00:36,594 --> 01:00:38,653
I believe he died of a broken heart.

676
01:00:40,131 --> 01:00:41,689
After Pop died...

677
01:00:43,234 --> 01:00:46,726
...and the neighborhood kids wanted
to go to Coney lsland to play...

678
01:00:48,373 --> 01:00:51,103
...one of the other fathers,
Mr. Madano...

679
01:00:51,309 --> 01:00:55,075
...used to slip me a little money so
I could go play with the kids too.

680
01:01:02,754 --> 01:01:04,688
You know how I repay Mr. Madano?

681
01:01:04,889 --> 01:01:07,289
You want to know
how I thanked him tonight?

682
01:01:08,326 --> 01:01:09,588
I arrested him.

683
01:01:10,395 --> 01:01:12,386
Just so I could get to Richie.

684
01:01:14,165 --> 01:01:15,996
That's how crazy I get.

685
01:01:17,568 --> 01:01:21,504
Gino, these may be your streets
and your neighborhood...

686
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:24,669
...but there are
other police officers.

687
01:01:26,577 --> 01:01:28,408
I'm really proud of what you do.

688
01:01:31,082 --> 01:01:33,243
And I know how everybody loves you.

689
01:01:34,352 --> 01:01:36,343
But Tony needs a father...

690
01:01:37,255 --> 01:01:38,847
...and I need a husband.

691
01:01:41,759 --> 01:01:44,853
What are we talking,
reconciliation over here?

692
01:01:45,363 --> 01:01:47,763
No, we're talking a lifetime deal.

693
01:01:48,533 --> 01:01:50,091
All or nothing.

694
01:01:52,870 --> 01:01:54,098
I could do that.

695
01:01:54,872 --> 01:01:56,271
That I could do.

696
01:02:09,620 --> 01:02:10,951
I love you.

697
01:02:32,243 --> 01:02:34,905
- Tony! We need Tony!
- Get down in the bathtub!

698
01:02:35,146 --> 01:02:36,340
In the bathtub.

699
01:03:16,020 --> 01:03:17,248
You're dead.

700
01:03:26,297 --> 01:03:28,162
Come on, you rat bastard!

701
01:03:33,938 --> 01:03:35,030
Drop it!

702
01:03:36,641 --> 01:03:38,302
You going to shoot an unarmed man?

703
01:03:38,643 --> 01:03:41,612
I wouldn't.
You know what I'm going to do?

704
01:03:41,846 --> 01:03:43,575
You motherfucker!

705
01:03:55,326 --> 01:03:59,057
Angie, send me units
over to my apartment.

706
01:03:59,330 --> 01:04:02,390
There's been a shooting
over at my place.

707
01:04:02,834 --> 01:04:05,997
It's a bunch of Richie Madano's crew.
They're all deceased.

708
01:04:14,445 --> 01:04:17,175
Going to take you to a hotel
with your mother.

709
01:04:20,284 --> 01:04:24,516
I know that this is not an easy thing
and I know you're upset.

710
01:04:24,789 --> 01:04:26,723
l'll take care of it right away.

711
01:04:32,363 --> 01:04:33,193
Oh, shit!

712
01:04:35,867 --> 01:04:36,856
Fellas...

713
01:04:37,535 --> 01:04:38,502
...have a drink.

714
01:04:38,803 --> 01:04:39,929
Never mind that bullshit.

715
01:04:40,204 --> 01:04:41,398
Sit down, dickhead.

716
01:04:42,440 --> 01:04:45,136
We're looking for your brother.
Where is he?

717
01:04:45,943 --> 01:04:47,808
He ain't been around.
I ain't seen him.

718
01:04:48,012 --> 01:04:49,502
You understand English?

719
01:04:49,814 --> 01:04:51,475
Teach this guy some English.

720
01:04:51,716 --> 01:04:54,617
You fucking bum.
You want to give me the right answer?

721
01:04:54,819 --> 01:04:57,083
Where's your fucking brother?
You cocksucker!

722
01:04:57,388 --> 01:04:59,379
l'll break your fucking head!

723
01:04:59,657 --> 01:05:03,821
You're both dead, you fucking bums!
The two of you! Tell him that!

724
01:05:04,061 --> 01:05:07,827
Say Rusty told you you're dead!
The two of yous!

725
01:05:12,503 --> 01:05:13,902
You asshole!

726
01:05:22,013 --> 01:05:24,174
Get the fuck out of here!

727
01:05:25,683 --> 01:05:27,548
Get the fuck out of here, man!

728
01:05:29,921 --> 01:05:32,651
I bet you're real popular
in your neighborhood now.

729
01:05:32,857 --> 01:05:36,088
Angie, I was never too popular
with my neighbors.

730
01:05:36,360 --> 01:05:37,884
I'm heading to Lamore's now.

731
01:05:56,280 --> 01:05:57,611
Patti back yet?

732
01:05:58,215 --> 01:06:00,877
Can I talk to you in private
for a minute, please?

733
01:06:05,222 --> 01:06:06,621
Sit over here.

734
01:06:12,964 --> 01:06:14,056
Is this you?

735
01:06:14,966 --> 01:06:16,456
My name's Terry Malloy.

736
01:06:16,734 --> 01:06:18,201
So who's Roxanne?

737
01:06:18,402 --> 01:06:21,030
Richie's girlfriend.
I thought that's who you were looking for.

738
01:06:21,238 --> 01:06:23,297
It is.
Do you know where I can find her?

739
01:06:24,408 --> 01:06:27,605
I think she lives here in Brooklyn,
but I don't know where.

740
01:06:27,812 --> 01:06:31,475
You don't know where. What are you,
a concerned citizen now?

741
01:06:31,749 --> 01:06:32,681
Why not?

742
01:06:32,883 --> 01:06:34,350
Who is Richie to you,
anyway?

743
01:06:34,819 --> 01:06:36,309
A piece of shit.

744
01:06:37,521 --> 01:06:39,284
How come you look like
you been crying?

745
01:06:41,092 --> 01:06:42,787
I got a fucking migraine.

746
01:06:45,496 --> 01:06:47,657
Listen, I want to ask
you something.

747
01:06:48,599 --> 01:06:49,691
Do you know this girl?

748
01:06:55,439 --> 01:06:57,600
Maybe you could sit over here.

749
01:06:58,843 --> 01:07:00,003
You all right?

750
01:07:02,213 --> 01:07:03,043
Come on, Terry.

751
01:07:05,683 --> 01:07:07,173
You have to talk to me.

752
01:07:10,855 --> 01:07:12,117
Who is it?

753
01:07:12,456 --> 01:07:14,185
It's Roxanne.

754
01:07:16,193 --> 01:07:18,218
And you were fucking Bobby
at the same time?

755
01:07:18,629 --> 01:07:21,359
Don't be that way.
Come on. Settle down.

756
01:07:26,937 --> 01:07:28,063
She got a last name?

757
01:07:28,639 --> 01:07:30,368
Ford. Roxanne Ford.

758
01:08:10,081 --> 01:08:11,742
How you doing, Vermeer?

759
01:08:13,751 --> 01:08:16,982
How the hell did you get up here, man?
Jesus Christ!

760
01:08:19,690 --> 01:08:21,521
He didn't have
nothing to do with it.

761
01:08:33,370 --> 01:08:37,864
Where you been? We been waiting
around here all night for you.

762
01:08:43,114 --> 01:08:45,014
What you been waiting on?

763
01:08:46,784 --> 01:08:47,808
What you been waiting on?

764
01:08:48,385 --> 01:08:50,250
Waiting on if you need us.
What do you think?

765
01:08:50,454 --> 01:08:51,785
What happened to your nose?

766
01:08:54,458 --> 01:08:57,916
Gino came around, playing the role.
Busting up the place.

767
01:08:58,129 --> 01:08:59,721
What, you ain't got a piece?

768
01:09:02,466 --> 01:09:04,400
You got a piece behind the bar.

769
01:09:04,735 --> 01:09:07,795
You let him do that to your face?
Why didn't you whack him?

770
01:09:08,005 --> 01:09:11,372
All I heard was you clipped Bobby.
You want me to whack a cop too?

771
01:09:12,576 --> 01:09:15,636
Nobody has to worry
about you stepping on your dick.

772
01:09:18,749 --> 01:09:22,981
You know how wacko he gets!
And with you doing Bobby like that!

773
01:09:23,654 --> 01:09:27,317
You're mistaking me
for someone who gives a shit.

774
01:09:28,492 --> 01:09:30,119
If Gino and me bang heads...

775
01:09:30,327 --> 01:09:32,295
...he'll be racked
in a closed casket.

776
01:09:34,598 --> 01:09:36,156
You won't
let him take you?

777
01:09:38,002 --> 01:09:39,401
What are you, a clown?

778
01:09:41,338 --> 01:09:43,670
Take me? Take me where?

779
01:09:51,348 --> 01:09:53,714
You let one motherfucker take you!

780
01:09:53,951 --> 01:09:58,615
It ain't just Gino! Bulls are banging
down doors all over the neighborhood.

781
01:09:59,990 --> 01:10:01,651
It's Frankie's guys.
They're back!

782
01:10:01,859 --> 01:10:06,455
Them too! Every couple of hours
a different bunch comes slapping me.

783
01:10:06,697 --> 01:10:09,222
Stop whining like a cunt
and get your piece.

784
01:10:15,739 --> 01:10:16,569
I can't.

785
01:10:19,543 --> 01:10:21,477
Don't let me see you again.

786
01:10:23,314 --> 01:10:25,009
Don't ever let me
see you again.

787
01:10:33,357 --> 01:10:36,087
Good evening, fellas.
Nice to see you again.

788
01:10:37,228 --> 01:10:39,788
Never mind the bullshit.
Where the fuck is he?

789
01:10:40,331 --> 01:10:41,263
Over here, Sal.

790
01:10:57,881 --> 01:10:59,212
You lose.

791
01:12:23,867 --> 01:12:25,129
Who's she?

792
01:12:26,704 --> 01:12:28,171
She brought me
to the girlfriend.

793
01:12:28,372 --> 01:12:32,536
She just had to identify the body,
so she's a little upset.

794
01:12:33,444 --> 01:12:36,038
Did you have breakfast this morning?

795
01:12:36,947 --> 01:12:39,040
Good.
Because it ain't pretty.

796
01:12:50,260 --> 01:12:51,090
What is it?

797
01:12:51,462 --> 01:12:54,056
He killed Allie
and 3 of the other guys.

798
01:12:55,232 --> 01:12:56,790
This is no good.

799
01:12:57,301 --> 01:12:58,199
Let's go find Richie.

800
01:13:01,572 --> 01:13:05,303
O'IKelly, get upstairs and make them
photograph that thing right.

801
01:13:12,082 --> 01:13:15,108
This is what I found
in Bobby's desk.

802
01:13:16,153 --> 01:13:20,249
Bobby was doing this one and the one
in the car at the same time.

803
01:13:20,924 --> 01:13:24,985
Now, from the extreme rigor mortis
in the body, it looks like...

804
01:13:25,329 --> 01:13:28,560
...time of death, 24 hours ago.
Before Bobby.

805
01:13:30,934 --> 01:13:33,061
I'm getting too old for this shit.

806
01:13:33,270 --> 01:13:34,828
I know what you mean.

807
01:14:01,632 --> 01:14:03,964
Hey, keep it down.
My sister's sleeping.

808
01:14:04,201 --> 01:14:08,035
Wake her up.
We ain't disturbing yous, are we?

809
01:14:08,705 --> 01:14:10,366
Rica, come here.

810
01:14:10,874 --> 01:14:12,705
We're wanting a little party.

811
01:14:15,145 --> 01:14:16,806
I want a little party.

812
01:14:17,147 --> 01:14:19,707
It's kind of my going- Away party.
Right, Bobby?

813
01:14:19,983 --> 01:14:21,314
Right, Rich.

814
01:14:21,518 --> 01:14:23,816
You ain't got a problem with that,
do you?

815
01:14:24,388 --> 01:14:25,821
No, Rich. No problem.

816
01:14:35,732 --> 01:14:37,791
Angie? Get me Gino.
It's Picolino.

817
01:14:38,068 --> 01:14:42,061
Call up Willy the Pimp. You tell him
to send over his best broads.

818
01:14:42,272 --> 01:14:45,332
Nobody will say you hung out
with me just for the money.

819
01:14:52,015 --> 01:14:53,676
Richie, please, come on.

820
01:14:56,920 --> 01:14:59,013
l'll take care of you, Rich.

821
01:14:59,256 --> 01:15:00,917
l'll take care of you, Rich.

822
01:15:03,360 --> 01:15:04,384
Hey, boys!

823
01:15:05,429 --> 01:15:07,761
We're going to have us
a real good time tonight.

824
01:15:08,432 --> 01:15:10,764
Big time, Richie. Big time.

825
01:15:11,101 --> 01:15:14,093
It's my night! My last night!

826
01:15:19,710 --> 01:15:20,870
Who is it?

827
01:15:31,121 --> 01:15:32,179
How you doing, Laura?

828
01:15:32,389 --> 01:15:35,187
Good. Okay.
I couldn't sleep after Vick left.

829
01:15:35,459 --> 01:15:38,053
So I had a bath.
I'm better now.

830
01:15:48,739 --> 01:15:50,400
What are you doing?

831
01:15:50,741 --> 01:15:52,470
What are you looking for?

832
01:15:53,810 --> 01:15:56,244
No. No, Gino, that's my purse.

833
01:15:56,480 --> 01:15:58,471
Give me... Gino, stop!

834
01:16:05,389 --> 01:16:06,219
What's this?

835
01:16:08,659 --> 01:16:09,990
What is this?

836
01:16:10,260 --> 01:16:13,161
Is this what Richie threw on Bobby
after he shot him?

837
01:16:14,331 --> 01:16:15,593
That was fast thinking.

838
01:16:16,266 --> 01:16:18,359
Just like
a good cop's wife would.

839
01:16:20,604 --> 01:16:21,935
You know what I think?

840
01:16:22,172 --> 01:16:24,333
I think you found
one of these somewhere.

841
01:16:24,541 --> 01:16:26,805
And got so fucking mad
you couldn't see straight.

842
01:16:27,177 --> 01:16:32,012
So you sent one to Richie, never
dreaming he might actually kill Bobby.

843
01:16:34,351 --> 01:16:36,945
I only took it because
I wanted to protect him.

844
01:16:38,188 --> 01:16:40,520
See, this is Roxanne, here.

845
01:16:41,124 --> 01:16:44,958
Twenty-four years old.
Richie killed her first.

846
01:16:45,195 --> 01:16:47,186
You got it all wrong, Gino.

847
01:16:47,698 --> 01:16:50,599
I only took it
so people wouldn't know.

848
01:16:50,968 --> 01:16:52,299
Bobby was dirty, wasn't he?

849
01:16:53,203 --> 01:16:54,693
Or maybe...

850
01:16:54,905 --> 01:16:58,238
...he was just doing Richie's
girlfriend at the same time.

851
01:16:58,442 --> 01:16:59,807
I don't think so.

852
01:17:00,711 --> 01:17:04,044
I think that Bobby always wanted
to be like somebody else.

853
01:17:04,848 --> 01:17:08,978
He liked Richie's lifestyle, his money,
his women. You knew he was dirty.

854
01:17:09,519 --> 01:17:11,987
Bobby's gone now.
So are lots of other people.

855
01:17:12,255 --> 01:17:14,314
I didn't want to kill him.

856
01:17:14,524 --> 01:17:17,152
I just wanted to save my marriage.

857
01:17:17,661 --> 01:17:19,151
Come here, Laurie.

858
01:17:21,231 --> 01:17:23,791
I want my Bobby back.

859
01:17:24,267 --> 01:17:25,928
I want him back.

860
01:17:31,341 --> 01:17:34,105
You have an emergency phone call
from Picolino.

861
01:17:34,411 --> 01:17:36,208
Angie, patch me through
right now.

862
01:17:44,087 --> 01:17:47,079
Listen to me, Picolino.
I know that place.

863
01:17:47,691 --> 01:17:49,716
Get out of the neighborhood now.

864
01:20:57,547 --> 01:20:58,571
Hands on the table!

865
01:20:59,382 --> 01:21:00,610
What the fuck's going on?

866
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:19,061
My buddy Gino's here.

867
01:21:22,072 --> 01:21:23,562
I got to go play.

868
01:22:15,058 --> 01:22:16,150
Fuck you, cop!

869
01:22:29,806 --> 01:22:30,795
He's in the bathroom!

870
01:22:46,790 --> 01:22:48,155
What're you going to do?

871
01:22:48,992 --> 01:22:51,722
What're you going to do,
you going to arrest me?

872
01:22:51,928 --> 01:22:53,589
I'm out of bullets!

873
01:22:57,667 --> 01:22:59,157
That's a shame.

874
01:22:59,369 --> 01:23:02,167
Those bullets
could've saved you a lot of pain.

875
01:23:02,439 --> 01:23:04,100
I like pain, you know.

876
01:24:52,048 --> 01:24:53,538
l'll kill you.

877
01:25:01,825 --> 01:25:03,258
That's for Bobby.

878
01:25:06,830 --> 01:25:09,321
- What happened?
- I'm hit. Took one right here.

879
01:25:10,800 --> 01:25:12,427
What're you doing with my gun?!

880
01:25:14,804 --> 01:25:16,863
What the hell is wrong with you?
Jesus Christ!

881
01:25:17,107 --> 01:25:19,598
- You did the right thing.
- I did the right thing?

882
01:25:22,745 --> 01:25:25,077
I'm sorry it had to be this way.

883
01:25:25,348 --> 01:25:27,942
Tell the boss what you did.
Do the ritual thing.

884
01:25:28,151 --> 01:25:29,311
Are you sick?

885
01:25:30,420 --> 01:25:32,945
Geez, put him in a fucking trunk
in Jersey.

886
01:25:34,457 --> 01:25:36,322
That sounds great, but...

887
01:25:36,526 --> 01:25:39,984
...can we have dinner in the city,
me and you alone sometime?

888
01:25:40,597 --> 01:25:42,827
Sure, I won't even bring
my beeper.

889
01:25:43,533 --> 01:25:45,933
Speaking of food,
I could go for...

890
01:25:46,136 --> 01:25:49,765
...a chili hot dog with
cheese and french fries.

891
01:25:50,106 --> 01:25:54,270
Not for nothing. It's 9 a.m.
Eat here, you'll have gangrene by noon.

892
01:25:55,278 --> 01:25:58,179
Gino, I'm going to buy you a nice
romantic...

893
01:26:05,622 --> 01:26:06,953
Yo, fucknuts!

894
01:26:08,958 --> 01:26:10,289
You talking to me?

895
01:26:10,527 --> 01:26:14,486
Are you the guy who threw a puppy
out this car window the other day?

896
01:26:14,697 --> 01:26:17,894
- What's your business, anyway?
- I'm an animal lover.

897
01:26:18,101 --> 01:26:19,363
Animal lover?

898
01:26:20,203 --> 01:26:23,661
You don't mind your fucking business,
l'll stuff you in a bag...

899
01:26:23,873 --> 01:26:25,807
...and throw you out
a fucking window.

900
01:26:26,009 --> 01:26:28,637
- You're a tough guy?
- L'll show you how tough I am.

901
01:26:36,219 --> 01:26:37,880
My balls!

902
01:26:52,402 --> 01:26:56,395
Oh, Vick, look over here!
ls that a police dog, or what?

903
