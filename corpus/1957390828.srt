371
00:56:43,481 --> 00:56:46,485
You have really cute toes.

372
00:56:47,184 --> 00:56:48,320
Thank you.

373
00:56:50,487 --> 00:56:53,259
They're like gummy bears.

374
00:56:56,094 --> 00:56:58,329
Or like little pink popcorns.

375
00:57:09,074 --> 00:57:13,345
My brother's got this weird
little toe on one of his feet,

376
00:57:14,346 --> 00:57:15,847
bends the wrong way.

377
00:57:18,983 --> 00:57:20,219
It's really squishy.

378
00:57:22,454 --> 00:57:24,190
Like a little popcorn shrimp.

379
00:57:29,927 --> 00:57:32,364
[door opens]

380
00:57:38,336 --> 00:57:39,572
[Iris] Is he all right?

381

[toilet flushing]

382
00:58:14,306 --> 00:58:16,407
[Reed] You're out
of toilet paper.

383
00:59:01,619 --> 00:59:02,987
I can't sleep either.

384
00:59:07,059 --> 00:59:07,893
Okay.

385
00:59:21,972 --> 00:59:22,807
Let's go.

386
00:59:52,003 --> 00:59:53,972
Are your friends
always so intense?

387
00:59:58,443 --> 00:59:59,645
They like to have fun.

388
01:00:04,349 --> 01:00:05,851
[Ian] You don't?

389
01:00:09,922 --> 01:00:10,755
This is fun.

390
01:00:26,536 --> 01:00:27,872
That's not real.

391
01:00:30,641 --> 01:00:31,976
Oh, it's a classic.

392
01:00:33,344 --> 01:00:34,480
It means...

393
01:00:35,480 --> 01:00:39,784
It's when the earth, the moon

394
01:00:39,918 --> 01:00:42,554
and the sun are in alignment.

395
01:00:47,358 --> 01:00:50,429
Also a really sick
episode of "The X-Files".

396
01:00:52,429 --> 01:00:53,565
Say it.

397
01:00:55,934 --> 01:00:56,668
Say the word?

398
01:00:57,534 --> 01:00:59,570
I don't know how
to say the word.

399
01:01:04,375 --> 01:01:05,710
Shouldn't that be a rule?

400
01:01:08,746 --> 01:01:09,847
It's not a rule.

401
01:01:35,106 --> 01:01:37,141
Have you ever played
this game before?

402
01:02:16,713 --> 01:02:19,250
Breakfast time, buttholes.

403
01:02:27,659 --> 01:02:29,460
[laughing]

404
01:02:29,594 --> 01:02:32,463
So I look up,
and it is a bear.

405
01:02:32,597 --> 01:02:34,165
A huge one, all right?

406
01:02:34,298 --> 01:02:36,934
And I got back in
the car so fast,

407
01:02:37,068 --> 01:02:39,071
I didn't realized
I'd pissed myself.

408
01:02:39,204 --> 01:02:41,640
[laughing]

409
01:03:10,802 --> 01:03:11,903
Found it.

410
01:03:33,391 --> 01:03:34,960
Our shit's toast.

411
01:03:38,496 --> 01:03:43,702
We need clothes and weed.

Fuck yes.

414
01:04:13,331 --> 01:04:14,166
Looks good.

415
01:04:21,306 --> 01:04:22,307
What do you think?

416
01:04:25,909 --> 01:04:27,645
I've seen worse.

You wanna come in?

421
01:05:28,273 --> 01:05:30,608
I know I said I wouldn't
come around anymore,

422
01:05:30,742 --> 01:05:34,346
and this is really
the last time.

423
01:05:35,579 --> 01:05:36,414
Jim.

424
01:05:37,548 --> 01:05:38,983
You humiliated me.

425
01:05:39,115 --> 01:05:40,684
- I know, I'm sorry.
- No, I'm married now.

426
01:05:40,818 --> 01:05:43,188
What do you want me to do?

427

You blowing that
guy you were with?

This is...

430
01:06:00,070 --> 01:06:01,873
Never again, all right?

431
01:06:02,005 --> 01:06:03,875
Never, you understand?

432
01:06:04,007 --> 01:06:05,042
Don't do this.

433
01:06:12,784 --> 01:06:15,586
I'm not like you, Clarence.

434
01:06:15,719 --> 01:06:17,088
I'll never be like you.

435
01:06:17,922 --> 01:06:19,124

Yeah.
