1
00:00:01,398 --> 00:00:03,440
- [Man] You bad little motherfucker

2
00:00:03,440 --> 00:00:05,770
you think you outta sight.

3
00:00:05,770 --> 00:00:08,101
But you ain't done nothin' yet

4
00:00:08,101 --> 00:00:11,855
until you face the bad, bad Dolemite.

5
00:00:11,855 --> 00:00:14,522
(ominous music)

6
00:00:29,256 --> 00:00:30,089
- Nyah.

7
00:00:31,665 --> 00:00:34,415
(doors rumbling)

8
00:00:37,845 --> 00:00:39,902
(ominous humming)

9
00:00:39,902 --> 00:00:42,402
(eerie music)

10
00:00:48,787 --> 00:00:51,454
(doors banging)

11
00:01:03,413 --> 00:01:06,330
Wu-Tang (mumbles)!

12
00:01:16,683 --> 00:01:19,183
(eye buzzing)

13
00:01:26,942 --> 00:01:29,859
(arrows whooshing)

14
00:01:35,197 --> 00:01:36,030
Shit.

15
00:01:41,659 --> 00:01:45,242
(suspenseful drum beating)

16
00:01:56,791 --> 00:01:59,708
(ninjas whooshing)

17
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:02,990
Zygos.

18
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:04,956
- Don't come closer, Tupac.

19
00:02:04,956 --> 00:02:06,454
There's nothing for you here.

20
00:02:06,454 --> 00:02:09,186
Leave now with your life
while you have a chance.

21
00:02:09,186 --> 00:02:11,214
- Yo, I came here to boot some shit.

22
00:02:11,214 --> 00:02:14,719
So back the fuck up before
you get smacked the fuck up.

23
00:02:14,719 --> 00:02:16,810
- There's nothing of value here.

24
00:02:16,810 --> 00:02:17,727
- Bullshit!

25
00:02:19,891 --> 00:02:20,891
What's that?

26
00:02:22,970 --> 00:02:24,066
- Not on your life!

27
00:02:24,066 --> 00:02:25,796
Kill me first, you bastard!

28
00:02:25,796 --> 00:02:29,946
- Step off bitch and maybe
I'll spare your punk ass.

29
00:02:29,946 --> 00:02:31,196
Go on, beat it!

30
00:02:32,705 --> 00:02:34,938
- Bastard, you dare have the nerve

31
00:02:34,938 --> 00:02:37,445
to insult the Clan of the Wu-Tang?!

32
00:02:37,445 --> 00:02:38,667
- Why not?

33
00:02:38,667 --> 00:02:39,917
You ain't shit!

34
00:02:41,775 --> 00:02:44,800
(both grunting)

35
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,217
(arms and feet thudding)

36
00:03:06,555 --> 00:03:09,305
(arms whooshing)

37
00:03:21,650 --> 00:03:24,400
(Tupac grunting)

38
00:03:31,322 --> 00:03:35,489
(arms thudding)
(both grunting)

39
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:47,603
(Tupac punching and grunting)

40
00:03:59,794 --> 00:04:01,925
(ominous music)

41
00:04:01,925 --> 00:04:05,592
(Tupac laughing maniacally)

42
00:04:07,064 --> 00:04:08,644
- (winces) No!

43
00:04:08,644 --> 00:04:09,477
No!

44
00:04:15,076 --> 00:04:18,909
(Tupac laughing and grunting)

45
00:04:27,832 --> 00:04:31,415
(suspenseful tribal music)

46
00:04:42,696 --> 00:04:46,363
(speaking foreign language)

47
00:04:51,575 --> 00:04:54,075
- The Hunchback of Notre Dame.

48
00:04:58,022 --> 00:04:58,855
Well!

49
00:05:04,347 --> 00:05:07,264
Aah, look at this bad motherfucker.

50
00:05:10,443 --> 00:05:11,693
Son of a bitch.

51
00:05:16,895 --> 00:05:19,264
Well, thing-ting-tong.

52
00:05:19,264 --> 00:05:20,952
Take the thing is strong.

53
00:05:20,952 --> 00:05:24,202
(Monk Ru-Dee chanting)

54
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:38,913
Aah.

55
00:05:47,529 --> 00:05:50,452
Greetings my yellow brotha.

56
00:05:50,452 --> 00:05:53,202
You are hip lookin' motherfucker.

57
00:05:55,767 --> 00:05:59,647
I'm Monk Ru-Dee from the Dolemite Clan.

58
00:05:59,647 --> 00:06:02,863
I've come from China seekin' wisdom,

59
00:06:02,863 --> 00:06:07,030
lookin' for some power and the
nearest (mumbles) hospital.

60
00:06:09,020 --> 00:06:10,482
- Buddha bless you.

61
00:06:10,482 --> 00:06:12,315
Welcome to our temple.

62
00:06:13,784 --> 00:06:18,133
Do you care to play a
game of Chinese Chess?

63
00:06:18,133 --> 00:06:22,300
Our Game Boy is broke (mumbles) light.

64
00:06:23,867 --> 00:06:27,056
- What kind of motherfuckin' shit is this?

65
00:06:27,056 --> 00:06:31,028
- Dolemite Clan decide
when Tupac was here,

66
00:06:31,028 --> 00:06:33,220
but we cast him away.

67
00:06:33,220 --> 00:06:34,053
- You did?

68
00:06:35,327 --> 00:06:38,019
Oh, well what did you do?

69
00:06:38,019 --> 00:06:41,619
- He was (mumbles) all
night and fighting all day.

70
00:06:41,619 --> 00:06:44,133
- If I'd have been here, I'd
have kicked his goddamn ass.

71
00:06:44,133 --> 00:06:48,300
So tell me this, which way
did that motherfucker go?

72
00:06:50,681 --> 00:06:53,458
When I catch him, Imma
put these hush puppies

73
00:06:53,458 --> 00:06:55,541
up his motherfucking ass.

74
00:06:56,915 --> 00:06:58,498
- Buddha bless you.

75
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:04,420
(birds chirping)

76
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,087
(ominous music)

77
00:07:21,364 --> 00:07:24,531
(ninja mouth calling)

78
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,330
(both screaming)

79
00:07:39,576 --> 00:07:40,826
- Ninja hitmen?

80
00:07:55,058 --> 00:07:59,225
(ninjas grunting)
(arms whooshing)

81
00:08:00,422 --> 00:08:04,362
- May I suggest that you
back off or you'll be hurt?

82
00:08:04,362 --> 00:08:07,195
- [Ninja] Stupid gringo, kill him!

83
00:08:14,985 --> 00:08:19,152
(kicks thudding)
(ninjas grunting)

84
00:09:58,464 --> 00:10:01,214
- Come on, let's get out of here!

85
00:10:03,779 --> 00:10:05,646
- You're good.

86
00:10:05,646 --> 00:10:07,396
- Thank you, my Lord.

87
00:10:09,374 --> 00:10:10,707
- Move it along.

88
00:10:27,490 --> 00:10:30,073
(bell tolling)

89
00:10:37,518 --> 00:10:41,685
- Sir Prince Sanada has foiled
the assassination attempt.

90
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:47,301
- (laughs) So the meddlesome fool

91
00:10:47,301 --> 00:10:49,329
thought he could meddle in our affair

92
00:10:49,329 --> 00:10:52,167
and hide in the Shaolin temple afterwards.

93
00:10:52,167 --> 00:10:54,429
We'll show him different.

94
00:10:54,429 --> 00:10:56,512
- [Ninjas] Yes, Lordship!

95
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:01,164
- Round up the men and prepare the ships

96
00:11:01,164 --> 00:11:03,260
to set sail for China.

97
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:07,334
I want both the Prince and
Shaolin temple destroyed.

98
00:11:07,334 --> 00:11:11,974
Not a single monk shall be
spared a horrible death.

99
00:11:11,974 --> 00:11:13,641
I want them crushed!

100
00:11:14,922 --> 00:11:16,933
- [Ninjas] Yes, Lordship!

101
00:11:16,933 --> 00:11:20,516
(Lord laughing maniacally)

102
00:11:26,561 --> 00:11:29,200
(soft, suspenseful music)

103
00:11:29,200 --> 00:11:33,367
(bell tolling)
(soft guitar music)

104
00:11:55,911 --> 00:11:57,719
- Buddha bless you.

105
00:11:57,719 --> 00:11:58,886
Arise, my son.

106
00:12:01,007 --> 00:12:03,257
- Thank you, High Holiness.

107
00:12:06,336 --> 00:12:09,336
- What brings you to Shaolin temple?

108
00:12:10,332 --> 00:12:13,332
- Master, I have traveled from Japan

109
00:12:14,531 --> 00:12:19,235
to learn the sacred arts
of the Shaolin temple.

110
00:12:19,235 --> 00:12:21,898
So Master, I would be most honored

111
00:12:21,898 --> 00:12:24,182
if you could teach me those arts,

112
00:12:24,182 --> 00:12:27,765
so I could spread their
knowledge in Japan.

113
00:12:29,758 --> 00:12:33,258
- Normally Sir, we don't accept strangers.

114
00:12:34,388 --> 00:12:37,367
But another outsider
from the Dolemite Clan

115
00:12:37,367 --> 00:12:40,534
has been allowed, so you may stay too.

116
00:12:43,411 --> 00:12:45,852
- Thank you Abbot, you are most kind.

117
00:12:45,852 --> 00:12:48,938
(bell tolling)

118
00:12:48,938 --> 00:12:52,105
(soft soothing music)

119
00:12:59,549 --> 00:13:02,393
- Excuse me, are you Abbot White?

120
00:13:02,393 --> 00:13:06,185
- Yes, I've been expecting
you, please sit down.

121
00:13:06,185 --> 00:13:08,185
- Thank you, High Abbot.

122
00:13:12,137 --> 00:13:15,901
- (sighs) Yes I know that
the reason you are here

123
00:13:15,901 --> 00:13:19,033
is because of this ninja conspiracy.

124
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:20,366
Is that correct?

125
00:13:21,429 --> 00:13:24,987
- Master, I wish to
learn Shaolin techniques

126
00:13:24,987 --> 00:13:27,154
so that I may defeat them.

127
00:13:30,251 --> 00:13:32,126
- The ninjas and Shaolin have been at odds

128
00:13:32,126 --> 00:13:34,142
for a great many years.

129
00:13:34,142 --> 00:13:37,975
I remember the last time
I ran into them, hmm.

130
00:13:39,724 --> 00:13:42,974
(dramatic fight music)

131
00:13:54,358 --> 00:13:58,525
(blades swooshing)
(ninjas shouting)

132
00:14:14,360 --> 00:14:17,943
(idol laughing maniacally)

133
00:14:29,258 --> 00:14:30,925
- Ninja black magic.

134
00:14:38,756 --> 00:14:42,339
(idol laughing maniacally)

135
00:14:44,140 --> 00:14:45,272
Buddha have mercy.

136
00:14:45,272 --> 00:14:49,002
I demand that you tricksters
show yourselves right now.

137
00:14:49,002 --> 00:14:51,816
- Silly Abbot, Trix are for kids.

138
00:14:51,816 --> 00:14:53,566
Prepare to die, monk.

139
00:14:54,514 --> 00:14:57,953
- You have entered the
37th chamber of Shaolin

140
00:14:57,953 --> 00:14:59,814
and now because of your actions,

141
00:14:59,814 --> 00:15:01,713
you must suffer the consequences.

142
00:15:01,713 --> 00:15:03,693
I demand that you show yourselves.

143
00:15:03,693 --> 00:15:04,526
Come out!

144
00:15:14,194 --> 00:15:18,361
(swords whooshing)
(ninjas grunting)

145
00:15:28,277 --> 00:15:32,444
(fists thudding)
(ninjas grunting)

146
00:15:44,829 --> 00:15:48,996
(ninjas shouting)
(swords whooshing)

147
00:16:16,837 --> 00:16:21,004
(ninja shouting)
(shelf crashing)

148
00:16:31,419 --> 00:16:34,669
(smoke bomb exploding)

149
00:16:36,543 --> 00:16:39,367
- Another attack is inevitable.

150
00:16:39,367 --> 00:16:41,411
Your arrival foreshadows that.

151
00:16:41,411 --> 00:16:44,504
- Master, I--
- Enough of this.

152
00:16:44,504 --> 00:16:47,087
Let's begin your education now.

153
00:16:48,781 --> 00:16:51,031
- Thank you sir, I'm ready.

154
00:16:52,119 --> 00:16:55,099
- First, I'll show you
the five-style fist.

155
00:16:55,099 --> 00:16:57,003
Pay attention.

156
00:16:57,003 --> 00:16:58,883
- I won't disappoint you, Master.

157
00:16:58,883 --> 00:17:03,606
I've been preparing for
this chance all my life.

158
00:17:03,606 --> 00:17:05,160
- Huh.

159
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:07,224
- Shaolin Kung Fu derives itself

160
00:17:07,224 --> 00:17:09,180
from nature's five elements.

161
00:17:09,180 --> 00:17:12,847
They're metal, wood,
earth, fire, and water.

162
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:18,833
- Dammit, why does he teach
a foreigner and not me?

163
00:17:19,805 --> 00:17:22,055
- Yes Master, I understand.

164
00:17:23,016 --> 00:17:23,849
- Good.

165
00:17:24,704 --> 00:17:27,037
Let's begin with the basics.

166
00:17:30,340 --> 00:17:32,007
- I'm ready, Master.

167
00:17:33,496 --> 00:17:35,144
- Wait, where are you going?
- Leave me alone!

168
00:17:35,144 --> 00:17:38,590
- You're not allowed to leave, you can't.

169
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,287
- Who's gonna stop me?

170
00:17:40,287 --> 00:17:41,204
- Well I...

171
00:17:48,577 --> 00:17:50,170
I better tell the Abbot what happened.

172
00:17:50,170 --> 00:17:51,003
- Right

173
00:17:56,614 --> 00:17:58,804
- Abbot White, Sir.

174
00:17:58,804 --> 00:18:00,304
- What is it, boy?

175
00:18:01,176 --> 00:18:02,619
- It's bad, Sir.

176
00:18:02,619 --> 00:18:05,369
It's Chi Kang, he's run away Sir.

177
00:18:07,392 --> 00:18:08,392
- That fool!

178
00:18:09,395 --> 00:18:11,305
Buddha (mumbles).

179
00:18:11,305 --> 00:18:13,888
(bell tolling)

180
00:18:21,309 --> 00:18:22,805
The five-style fist.

181
00:18:22,805 --> 00:18:26,388
All the effective moves
of Shaolin Kung Fu.

182
00:18:28,485 --> 00:18:29,318
Tiger!

183
00:18:30,173 --> 00:18:34,340
(Master grunting)
(arms whooshing)

184
00:18:40,235 --> 00:18:41,068

(Master grunting)
(arms whooshing)

186
00:18:56,963 --> 00:18:58,027

(Master grunting)
(arms whooshing)

188
00:19:12,003 --> 00:19:13,569

(Master grunting)
(sand shuffling)

190
00:19:30,378 --> 00:19:31,599
Monkey!

(Master grunting)
(arms whooshing)

192
00:19:50,175 --> 00:19:51,922
- Look at that shit!

193
00:19:51,922 --> 00:19:55,362
This motherfucker's outta sight!

194
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:59,529
(Master grunting)

(soft Asian music)
(student grunting)

202
00:24:43,198 --> 00:24:45,365
- Ooh, my man is doin' it.

203
00:25:26,468 --> 00:25:29,468
- (slaps) Good job.

204
00:25:33,648 --> 00:25:37,843
(crickets chirping)
(fire crackling)

205
00:25:37,843 --> 00:25:42,010
(soft, soothing music)
(woman moaning)

206
00:26:03,116 --> 00:26:07,252
- My God, it's true what
they say about you black men.

207
00:26:07,252 --> 00:26:11,419
- (laughs) It sure is, my sweet honey.

208
00:26:12,434 --> 00:26:15,101
- Come on, let's get it on stud.

209
00:26:16,462 --> 00:26:19,991
(fire crackling)

210
00:26:19,991 --> 00:26:24,115

(arms whooshing)
(both grunting)

212
00:27:09,005 --> 00:27:10,755
- Master, forgive me.

213
00:27:11,879 --> 00:27:14,546
- Well now, what do I have here?

214
00:27:16,460 --> 00:27:19,140
Well done; you've improved.

215
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,119
First, keep practicing and
you'll be my best student yet.

216
00:27:23,119 --> 00:27:24,786
- Thank you, Master.

217
00:27:26,197 --> 00:27:29,754
- (sighs) Still, these strikes alone

218
00:27:29,754 --> 00:27:33,014
won't be able to defeat the
power of the ninja artists.

219
00:27:33,014 --> 00:27:35,182
So you'll have to use
your brains to fight them.

220
00:27:35,182 --> 00:27:39,099
- Yes Master, I will use
both skill and brains.

221
00:27:40,603 --> 00:27:42,848
- Very well, keep practicing.

222
00:27:42,848 --> 00:27:43,681

(wind howling)
(ominous music)

224
00:28:06,615 --> 00:28:10,871
- (sighs) Buddha, have mercy.

225
00:28:10,871 --> 00:28:12,538
A Ninja deadly trap.

226
00:28:48,192 --> 00:28:52,359
(ninjas shouting)
(swords clanging)

227
00:29:00,195 --> 00:29:03,112
(soft Asian music)

228
00:29:07,828 --> 00:29:09,245

(ominous music)

234
00:30:38,780 --> 00:30:40,197
Buddha bless you.

236
00:30:55,167 --> 00:30:58,417

239
00:31:27,574 --> 00:31:31,405
(man and Abbot shouting)

240
00:31:31,405 --> 00:31:32,238
- Let me go.

241
00:31:32,238 --> 00:31:34,905
It's me, Abbot White, let me go!

242
00:31:38,881 --> 00:31:39,798
Release me!

243
00:31:41,113 --> 00:31:42,065
Let me go!

244
00:31:42,065 --> 00:31:43,948
It's me, Abbot White.

245
00:31:43,948 --> 00:31:44,781
Release me!

246
00:31:44,781 --> 00:31:46,065
Let me go, you fool.

247
00:31:46,065 --> 00:31:49,065
Let me go! (grunts)

248
00:31:53,708 --> 00:31:56,958
(instrument whistling)

249
00:32:11,024 --> 00:32:13,691

(man laughing maniacally)

253
00:32:45,425 --> 00:32:48,092
(ominous music)

254
00:33:00,957 --> 00:33:03,547
- Good news Sir, Abbot White is dead.

255
00:33:03,547 --> 00:33:05,380
I saw his body myself.

256
00:33:10,135 --> 00:33:12,383
- (claps) Excellent.

257
00:33:12,383 --> 00:33:15,466
(Phantasm whooshing)

258
00:33:50,227 --> 00:33:52,603
Mr (mumbles), what do
you think of my student?

259
00:33:52,603 --> 00:33:54,513
Her name is Phantasm.

260
00:33:54,513 --> 00:33:58,680
- (laughs) A martial arts masterpiece.

261
00:34:04,501 --> 00:34:07,388
- Your wish is my command.

262
00:34:07,388 --> 00:34:09,888
- Go kill and return.
- Right.

263
00:34:12,338 --> 00:34:15,005
(ominous music)

264
00:34:34,713 --> 00:34:36,402
- Those beads.

265
00:34:36,402 --> 00:34:37,235
Master?

266
00:34:37,235 --> 00:34:41,402
- (laughs) I screwed a guy to
death so I could get those.

267
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:45,366
- Where did you get those?

268
00:34:48,910 --> 00:34:52,239
- Come on over here and
I'll whisper it to you.

269
00:34:52,239 --> 00:34:53,647
- That'll be a pleasure.

270
00:34:53,647 --> 00:34:57,814
(arms whooshing)
(both shouting)

271
00:35:26,974 --> 00:35:30,141

(Shurikens whooshing and clanging)

274
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:34,334
(fists smacking)
(both grunting)

275
00:36:54,936 --> 00:36:57,519
- Those must be Master's beads.

276
00:37:01,177 --> 00:37:03,344
Big brother, look at this.

277
00:37:07,904 --> 00:37:08,821
Look, here.

278
00:37:10,828 --> 00:37:13,644
- Yes, these are Abbot White's beads.

279
00:37:13,644 --> 00:37:14,764
Let's tell the Abbot.

280
00:37:14,764 --> 00:37:17,597
Come on, we have no time to waste.

281
00:37:18,956 --> 00:37:21,873
(soft Asian music)

282
00:37:23,676 --> 00:37:25,509
- Prepare the funeral.

283
00:37:28,209 --> 00:37:31,209
(rhythmic drumming)

284
00:37:40,909 --> 00:37:43,492
(bell tolling)

285
00:37:58,033 --> 00:38:00,700
(ominous music)

286
00:38:25,837 --> 00:38:30,004
(ninjas shouting)
(sword swooshing)

287
00:38:36,813 --> 00:38:41,245
- Well well, if it ain't
the lost tribe of Shabazz.

288
00:38:41,245 --> 00:38:43,447
Don't tell me you white niggas.

289
00:38:43,447 --> 00:38:45,959
You're not here to stop me, are you?

290
00:38:45,959 --> 00:38:48,039
- Your goin' down, G.

291
00:38:48,039 --> 00:38:50,679
- Yo (mumbles), what you doin' here man?

292
00:38:50,679 --> 00:38:52,641
You're on the East side now, motherfucker.

293
00:38:52,641 --> 00:38:56,391
West side can't help
your sorry punk ass now.

294
00:38:59,469 --> 00:39:02,469
(knuckles cracking)

295
00:39:10,377 --> 00:39:14,544
(both grunting)
(fists thudding)

296
00:39:44,963 --> 00:39:47,373
- You want some more of this?

297
00:39:47,373 --> 00:39:51,540
(both shouting)
(fists thudding)

298
00:39:56,277 --> 00:39:57,610
Come and get it.

299
00:40:05,004 --> 00:40:09,171
(clan grunting and shouting)
(fists thudding)

300
00:40:20,077 --> 00:40:22,827
(kicks thudding)

301
00:40:50,337 --> 00:40:54,004
(death bell tolling loudly)

302
00:40:58,476 --> 00:41:02,309
(ninjas wincing and shouting)

303
00:41:10,456 --> 00:41:14,123
(Tupac laughing maniacally)

304
00:41:24,297 --> 00:41:27,047
- Come on let's get out of here.

305
00:41:35,585 --> 00:41:39,693
- (laughs) Get yourself
some Nikes next time.

306
00:41:39,693 --> 00:41:41,470
You sorry apple-headed Zulus.

307
00:41:41,470 --> 00:41:46,090
Let's get some fried chicken. (laughs)

308
00:41:46,090 --> 00:41:50,257
(serene Asian music)
(birds chirping)

309
00:41:51,593 --> 00:41:54,176
(both moaning)

310
00:41:56,269 --> 00:41:57,436
- Oh, my ears.

311
00:42:03,046 --> 00:42:06,629
(both moaning and wincing)

312
00:42:28,517 --> 00:42:29,934
- Oh my goodness.

313
00:42:51,189 --> 00:42:53,175
- Thanks ma'am.

314
00:42:53,175 --> 00:42:55,508
- It looks like you ran into

315
00:42:56,391 --> 00:42:58,349
Tupac of the Dolemite Clan.

316
00:42:58,349 --> 00:43:00,428
- That's right.

317
00:43:00,428 --> 00:43:02,944
You're damn right.
- It was him.

318
00:43:02,944 --> 00:43:05,548
We got no beef with the West side.

319
00:43:05,548 --> 00:43:07,854
That nigga's got to go.

320
00:43:07,854 --> 00:43:11,482
See if I don't cap his ass next time.

321
00:43:11,482 --> 00:43:15,878
- He is a sworn enemy
of the Wu-Tang tribe.

322
00:43:15,878 --> 00:43:19,880
He killed my father and
stole the death bell.

323
00:43:19,880 --> 00:43:24,336
He plans to unite with the
Ninjas and destroy Shaolin.

324
00:43:24,336 --> 00:43:26,262
I can't allow this to happen.

325
00:43:26,262 --> 00:43:27,442
- Let's join forces.

326
00:43:27,442 --> 00:43:29,265
I think it'd be a good
idea for both of us.

327
00:43:29,265 --> 00:43:30,765
- Right, but first

328
00:43:32,147 --> 00:43:33,551
to Shaolin.

329
00:43:33,551 --> 00:43:36,105
We must warn the Abbot.

330
00:43:36,105 --> 00:43:39,272
(ominous Asian music)

331
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:07,576
- I wonder if those fellers in the pajamas

332
00:44:07,576 --> 00:44:10,699
could give me directions to Shaolin.

333
00:44:10,699 --> 00:44:14,199
- Where do you think you're going, gringo?

334
00:44:15,789 --> 00:44:17,691
What's your name?

335
00:44:17,691 --> 00:44:18,524
- Me?

336
00:44:21,406 --> 00:44:23,479
Well I'm Davey Crockett.

337
00:44:23,479 --> 00:44:26,396
Hunter and tracker at your service.

338
00:44:28,049 --> 00:44:31,555
- Vamos now gringo or
I'll have to kill you.

339
00:44:31,555 --> 00:44:34,638
- I ain't gonna leave on your say so.

340
00:44:35,927 --> 00:44:38,760
(sword sheathing)

341
00:44:40,739 --> 00:44:41,572
En garde.

342
00:44:43,342 --> 00:44:44,175
- Wait.

343
00:44:46,243 --> 00:44:48,910
(ominous music)

344
00:44:59,344 --> 00:45:03,511
(swords clanging)
(both grunting)

345
00:45:16,664 --> 00:45:19,223
Let's get outta here!

346
00:45:19,223 --> 00:45:21,723
- Don't say I didn't warn ya.

347
00:45:35,842 --> 00:45:39,332
- We should have no trouble in
destroying the Shaolin temple

348
00:45:39,332 --> 00:45:41,646
now that we have Tupac on our side.

349
00:45:41,646 --> 00:45:42,896
Viva La Russia.

350
00:45:44,662 --> 00:45:48,857
Tupac is indeed a powerful
ally for anyone to have

351
00:45:48,857 --> 00:45:52,440
and I am sure that we
should be victorious.

352
00:45:54,638 --> 00:45:56,055
- You said it, G.

353
00:45:57,230 --> 00:46:01,397
We're gonna whip their
baldheaded asses. (laughs)

354
00:46:06,592 --> 00:46:09,175
(birds cooing)

355
00:46:14,122 --> 00:46:18,289
(fists thudding)
(both grunting)

356
00:46:20,849 --> 00:46:23,615
- Finest Shaolin techniques in action.

357
00:46:23,615 --> 00:46:25,198
Let's check it out.

358
00:46:27,729 --> 00:46:31,896
(legs whooshing)
(both grunting)

359
00:46:33,058 --> 00:46:35,808
(fists thudding)

360
00:46:43,831 --> 00:46:47,998
(fists pounding)
(both shouting)

361
00:46:49,421 --> 00:46:50,588
Do forgive me.

362
00:46:55,759 --> 00:46:59,926
(fists thudding)

363
00:47:05,730 --> 00:47:07,750
(man wincing)

364
00:47:07,750 --> 00:47:10,103
- So you wanna play rough, do ya?

365
00:47:10,103 --> 00:47:13,686
Good. (grunts and screams)

366
00:47:17,097 --> 00:47:21,264

367
00:47:22,849 --> 00:47:24,574

368
00:47:24,574 --> 00:47:27,683

(shouting and grunting)
(fists thudding)

370
00:47:37,878 --> 00:47:39,413
- Are you feelin' alright, my friend?

371
00:47:39,413 --> 00:47:41,080
A little sore maybe?

372
00:47:42,268 --> 00:47:44,201
- Come on then, come on.

373
00:47:44,201 --> 00:47:46,286
- Hey hey hey, calm down.

374
00:47:46,286 --> 00:47:47,878
Calm down now.

375
00:47:47,878 --> 00:47:51,333
He's only playing around with you.

376
00:47:51,333 --> 00:47:53,605
What's your purpose of your
coming to Shaolin, huh?

377
00:47:53,605 --> 00:47:58,053
- I came to train my
skills with some experts,

378
00:47:58,053 --> 00:47:59,636
not kids like that.

379
00:48:06,649 --> 00:48:09,566
(soft Asian music)

380
00:48:21,297 --> 00:48:23,557
- [Everyone] Greetings, Lord Abbot.

381
00:48:23,557 --> 00:48:25,305
We hope you are well.

382
00:48:25,305 --> 00:48:27,555
- [Abbot] Please be seated.

383
00:48:31,958 --> 00:48:33,708
- Abbot, these three?

384
00:48:35,198 --> 00:48:39,365
- Ah, well this girl is
from the tribe of Wu-Tang.

385
00:48:44,985 --> 00:48:48,694
And these men are from
the tribe of Shebazz.

386
00:48:48,694 --> 00:48:52,243
That's right, these men
have come to warn us

387
00:48:52,243 --> 00:48:54,607
of an impending ninja attack.

388
00:48:54,607 --> 00:48:58,203
Their army is already
entrenched in the region.

389
00:48:58,203 --> 00:49:02,370
It's just a matter of time
before they launch an attack.

390
00:49:03,368 --> 00:49:06,925
As you see, we must take precautions.

391
00:49:06,925 --> 00:49:10,675
This is of extreme
importance for our wealth.

392
00:49:12,619 --> 00:49:15,840
- Lady Wutasha, why are you here?

393
00:49:15,840 --> 00:49:19,678
- Master, Monk Ru-Dee of
the Dolemite Clan and I

394
00:49:19,678 --> 00:49:23,766
have been hunting Tupac,
the Westside Monk.

395
00:49:23,766 --> 00:49:26,291
He killed my father and then
stole our Wu-Tang family

396
00:49:26,291 --> 00:49:28,436
Dolby Stereo death bell.

397
00:49:28,436 --> 00:49:32,603
I must get it back from
him before he pawns it off.

398
00:49:37,164 --> 00:49:39,252
- Where's Monk Ru-Dee now?

399
00:49:39,252 --> 00:49:42,502
- Last I saw, he was looking for Tupac.

400
00:49:43,413 --> 00:49:46,413
- Alright then, I want everyone here

401
00:49:47,809 --> 00:49:51,042
to split up into small groups.

402
00:49:51,042 --> 00:49:55,739
If we are divided, we will
then stand a better chance

403
00:49:55,739 --> 00:49:58,656
of seeing the first attack quicker.

404
00:50:01,973 --> 00:50:03,723
Buddha bless you all.

405
00:50:05,497 --> 00:50:08,830
(energetic Asian music)

406
00:50:16,923 --> 00:50:20,159
♫ (Mumbles) one time last night

407
00:50:20,159 --> 00:50:23,659
♫ Everybody tell me I did

408
00:50:29,745 --> 00:50:30,654
I don't know.

409
00:50:30,654 --> 00:50:34,690
I'm wounded, (mumbles) here fight?

410
00:50:34,690 --> 00:50:35,863
Boy, I'm in shape.

411
00:50:35,863 --> 00:50:38,199
I'm in shape for a fight.

412
00:50:38,199 --> 00:50:40,616
But I mean don't wanna fight.

413
00:50:42,877 --> 00:50:46,127
(mumbling and burping)

414
00:51:05,849 --> 00:51:08,516
(hiccups) What?

415
00:51:11,162 --> 00:51:14,579
(muffled drunken speech)

416
00:51:43,696 --> 00:51:46,446
Matter of fact, get away from me.

417
00:51:49,204 --> 00:51:50,037
Look out.

418
00:51:53,625 --> 00:51:56,875
(suspenseful drumming)

419
00:52:02,265 --> 00:52:04,508
- Sam the Spliff.

420
00:52:04,508 --> 00:52:08,135
You motherfucker, you out here (mumbles)?

421
00:52:08,135 --> 00:52:10,997
You oughta get your ass a job.

422
00:52:10,997 --> 00:52:13,500
You know there's ninjas everywhere?

423
00:52:13,500 --> 00:52:15,465
- Yo, my brother.

424
00:52:15,465 --> 00:52:18,478
(muffled drunken speech)

425
00:52:18,478 --> 00:52:20,395
You need a little help.

426
00:52:21,781 --> 00:52:25,031
(muffled drunk speech)

427
00:52:48,394 --> 00:52:52,561

(ninja mouth vibrating)

433
00:54:33,347 --> 00:54:34,180
- Ninjas!

434
00:54:34,180 --> 00:54:35,912

439
00:56:44,821 --> 00:56:45,904
- After them.

440
00:56:50,907 --> 00:56:51,824
After them!

441
00:56:53,010 --> 00:56:54,998
No, you stay here and protect the Abbot.

442
00:56:54,998 --> 00:56:55,831
Come on!

443
00:57:03,787 --> 00:57:04,620
- Come on, let's take a look.

444
00:57:04,620 --> 00:57:06,703
- Alright.
- You're right.

445

(swords whooshing)
(ninjas grunting)

448
00:57:43,099 --> 00:57:44,842

Hey look, the circus has come to town.

454
00:58:47,412 --> 00:58:49,829
- Careful, I sense the Abbot.

455
00:58:53,692 --> 00:58:55,365
- Buddha bless you.

456
00:58:55,365 --> 00:58:58,300
Tell me, what brings
you to Shaolin temple?

457
00:58:58,300 --> 00:59:01,736
- We've got an old score
to settle you and I

458
00:59:01,736 --> 00:59:04,204
and you're harboring our enemy.

459
00:59:04,204 --> 00:59:05,220
Attack them!

460
00:59:05,220 --> 00:59:06,803

Huh?!

- You skanky ho.

482
01:05:35,463 --> 01:05:37,760
- You have brought tragedy
to the Wu-Tang family

483
01:05:37,760 --> 01:05:39,852
and shame to the Dolemite clan.

484
01:05:39,852 --> 01:05:42,221
It's time for you to die,
do you understand me?

485
01:05:42,221 --> 01:05:43,896
I'm going to kill you.

486
01:05:43,896 --> 01:05:45,767
I'm gonna rip you apart!

01:11:51,546 --> 01:11:53,022
He'll kill you.

516
01:11:53,022 --> 01:11:54,474
We can't defeat him like this.

517
01:11:54,474 --> 01:11:55,884
Let's get back to Shaolin.

518
01:11:55,884 --> 01:12:00,176

get back to the temple.
