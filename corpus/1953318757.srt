1
00:01:08,719 --> 00:01:13,315
When the hive doesn't work,
they say you have to change the queen.

2
00:01:14,079 --> 00:01:15,671
But what about us?

3
00:01:16,999 --> 00:01:19,433
What are we supposed to change?

4
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:49,118
There she is. There she is.

5
00:01:49,599 --> 00:01:52,113
There's the queen. Grab her.

6
00:01:58,239 --> 00:02:01,549
-Should I kill her?
-Yeah, kill her.

7
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,750
Poor thing.

8
00:02:05,319 --> 00:02:08,629
If the hive doesn't get stronger,
others will come take the honey again.

9
00:02:08,839 --> 00:02:10,795
Will the new queen
breed more worker bees?

10
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:12,149
She should.

11
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:14,920
Let's hope she's a good one.
Give her to me.

12
00:02:17,880 --> 00:02:19,279
Here.

13
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:21,479
There.

14
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,510
Here, let me do it.

15
00:04:04,040 --> 00:04:05,155
Amadeo.

16
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,550
-What do you need?
-Rope.

17
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:11,519
Mooring line?

18
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:12,835
That one will do.

19
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:14,678
Give me five meters.

20
00:04:19,321 --> 00:04:21,198
Your kids left for the day?

21
00:04:21,721 --> 00:04:23,313
Yes.

22
00:04:26,121 --> 00:04:27,634
Business doing well, right?

23
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:31,319
I can't complain.

24
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:36,673
A new boat....

25
00:04:44,641 --> 00:04:46,279
What else do you need?

26
00:04:48,121 --> 00:04:49,315
Packing tape.

27
00:05:17,321 --> 00:05:20,074
These are for the East Canal, right?

28
00:05:20,281 --> 00:05:21,396
Yeah.

29
00:05:21,601 --> 00:05:23,239
I'll take them.

30
00:05:23,441 --> 00:05:25,955
Not going to the El Dorado today?

31
00:05:26,161 --> 00:05:28,755
No, it's Monday. My day off. Why?

32
00:05:29,761 --> 00:05:31,399
No reason.

33
00:05:39,761 --> 00:05:41,080
Here.

34
00:05:43,561 --> 00:05:45,677
I'll give you the rest later.

35
00:05:47,201 --> 00:05:49,761
Rosa, I didn't clean the other crate.
Could you do it?

36
00:05:49,961 --> 00:05:51,155
Okay.

37
00:05:52,241 --> 00:05:53,799
Lock up after.

38
00:05:58,521 --> 00:06:00,830
And in the middle
of all that darkness, faith.

39
00:06:01,881 --> 00:06:03,872
He who wants to save his life...

40
00:06:04,081 --> 00:06:05,434
...will lose it...

41
00:06:05,641 --> 00:06:08,030
...but he who is willing
to lose it for me...

42
00:06:08,241 --> 00:06:10,880
...will be saved.

43
00:06:12,041 --> 00:06:15,272
When? When will it happen?

44
00:06:16,961 --> 00:06:19,874
That's for the Lord to decide.
We can't perceive that.

45
00:06:21,002 --> 00:06:24,790
The only thing I perceive
is you shorted me 30 pesos.

46
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:28,995
Can't you wait for payday
like everyone else?

47
00:06:31,762 --> 00:06:34,151
I already did my part of the job.

48
00:06:35,682 --> 00:06:37,912
On payday I'll be somewhere else.

49
00:06:41,522 --> 00:06:44,912
-What, are you going shopping?
-Something like that.

50
00:06:47,842 --> 00:06:50,754
Taking Baby for a walk?

51
00:06:50,962 --> 00:06:52,190
Don't call her that.

52
00:06:52,402 --> 00:06:54,597
Now that you're her boss....

53
00:07:04,962 --> 00:07:06,236
Did she talk about me?

54
00:07:08,562 --> 00:07:10,393
What did she say?

55
00:07:12,042 --> 00:07:13,361
What did she say?

56
00:07:14,642 --> 00:07:15,836
Well?

57
00:07:19,362 --> 00:07:21,922
Nothing, she didn't say a word.

58
00:07:23,522 --> 00:07:26,116
As if she were a saint....

59
00:07:44,482 --> 00:07:46,359
That moron probably got lost.

60
00:07:47,562 --> 00:07:50,235
Bet you a grand
he's here in 10 minutes.

61
00:07:50,922 --> 00:07:52,480
Okay.

62
00:08:00,002 --> 00:08:03,711
Why'd you let your godson
bring the guy by himself?

63
00:08:06,882 --> 00:08:09,680
I can't be seen dragging the old man
from the El Dorado.

64
00:08:10,562 --> 00:08:13,315
I know the kid's just starting, but...

65
00:08:13,602 --> 00:08:16,241
...if he wants to learn
he's gotta work.

66
00:08:19,682 --> 00:08:21,877
Of course, you're the boss....

67
00:08:23,202 --> 00:08:25,353
I'm his godfather, that's all.

68
00:08:30,323 --> 00:08:32,279
-There he is.
-Told you so.

69
00:08:50,003 --> 00:08:52,597
Rubén, you stupid motherfucker!

70
00:08:52,803 --> 00:08:54,282
You owe me a grand.

71
00:08:54,483 --> 00:08:56,314
How can you be such an idiot?

72
00:08:56,523 --> 00:08:57,512
What happened?

73
00:08:57,683 --> 00:09:01,312
What happened is I'm gonna beat
the shit out of you!

74
00:09:02,563 --> 00:09:04,713
You can't even put
a blindfold on right!

75
00:09:05,843 --> 00:09:10,314
You're pathetic! You don't even
deserve a beating. Asshole!

76
00:09:12,563 --> 00:09:14,394
Should I pull him out?

77
00:09:15,203 --> 00:09:17,194
Adrián, nobody saw me, I swear.

78
00:10:15,963 --> 00:10:19,956
EVERYBODY HAS A PLAN

79
00:10:59,164 --> 00:11:00,882
Strong heartbeat!

80
00:11:14,364 --> 00:11:16,036
You can sit up now.

81
00:11:16,484 --> 00:11:18,440
You're a good girl.

82
00:11:33,284 --> 00:11:35,275
If the temperature goes back up,
call me.

83
00:11:35,484 --> 00:11:37,475
I didn't think you'd make it.

84
00:11:39,644 --> 00:11:41,123
Bye.

85
00:11:41,324 --> 00:11:44,122
-Sorry I'm late.
-Here, use this.

86
00:11:47,284 --> 00:11:49,479
-Have you seen him?
-No, not yet.

87
00:11:51,484 --> 00:11:55,762
-What are you doing after?
-I have to go back to the clinic.

88
00:11:57,164 --> 00:11:58,358
There he is.

89
00:12:01,164 --> 00:12:02,756
-Hello.
-Hi.

90
00:12:03,004 --> 00:12:04,357
Look.

91
00:12:05,404 --> 00:12:07,360
Here, hold this for me.

92
00:12:09,684 --> 00:12:11,356
Careful.

93
00:12:12,124 --> 00:12:13,477
There you go.

94
00:12:13,684 --> 00:12:15,436
Hi there!

95
00:12:15,924 --> 00:12:18,484
-Is all the paperwork done?
-Yes.

96
00:12:18,684 --> 00:12:20,959
No, we're missing the lab results.

97
00:12:21,164 --> 00:12:24,395
-That's what we're missing.
-Yeah.

98
00:12:24,604 --> 00:12:26,754
I'm going to Mendoza this week...

99
00:12:26,964 --> 00:12:28,682
...for a book signing.

100
00:12:29,484 --> 00:12:31,520
-I'll bring them when I get back.
-Okay.

101
00:12:31,724 --> 00:12:36,116
I know we still have to wait,
but we're almost there.

102
00:12:36,365 --> 00:12:38,515
We're almost there!

103
00:12:39,165 --> 00:12:40,996
I have to take him back now.

104
00:12:41,205 --> 00:12:44,754
Listen, don't tell anyone
I let you see him, they'll kill me.

105
00:12:44,965 --> 00:12:46,523
Sure, don't worry.

106
00:12:46,725 --> 00:12:48,636
Okay, let's go.

107
00:12:48,845 --> 00:12:50,881
Careful with his head. There.

108
00:12:51,085 --> 00:12:52,677
-I'll call you.
-Thanks a lot.

109
00:12:52,885 --> 00:12:54,603
-Thank you.
-Bye, bye.

110
00:14:18,325 --> 00:14:19,997
Hi.

111
00:14:20,365 --> 00:14:22,162
What are you doing up?

112
00:14:22,765 --> 00:14:24,960
-I couldn't sleep.
-No?

113
00:14:26,285 --> 00:14:27,798
No.

114
00:14:33,245 --> 00:14:38,479
The party was nice.
Too bad you didn't come.

115
00:14:48,806 --> 00:14:50,762
Did you see
how tiny his fingers were?

116
00:14:57,286 --> 00:14:58,844
Yeah.

117
00:15:04,726 --> 00:15:06,284
Coming?

118
00:15:08,006 --> 00:15:09,678
I'll be right there.

119
00:15:16,246 --> 00:15:18,476
So then they blindfolded us...

120
00:15:19,366 --> 00:15:21,641
...like it was a game...

121
00:15:23,086 --> 00:15:25,646
...and asked us to rank the wines...

122
00:15:25,846 --> 00:15:30,317
...from the most expensive
to the cheapest.

123
00:15:31,286 --> 00:15:35,325
Then they took off the blindfolds
and told us the prices. It was silly.

124
00:15:36,926 --> 00:15:39,281
We got back to the hotel
at 3 in the morning...

125
00:15:39,486 --> 00:15:42,284
...and I couldn't sleep on the plane,
don't know why.

126
00:15:42,486 --> 00:15:44,954
I'm exhausted.

127
00:15:46,526 --> 00:15:47,515
I was thinking...

128
00:15:47,726 --> 00:15:51,082
...when the baby comes
we'll need to hire someone to help.

129
00:15:53,046 --> 00:15:55,082
Don't forget to leave me
the lab results.

130
00:15:55,286 --> 00:15:57,800
I'm going to the hospital
early tomorrow.

131
00:15:58,966 --> 00:16:01,036
No, no...

132
00:16:01,246 --> 00:16:03,282
...I didn't pick them up.

133
00:16:05,486 --> 00:16:06,680
Why, you didn't have time?

134
00:16:09,566 --> 00:16:11,124
Why didn't you go?

135
00:16:15,646 --> 00:16:17,637
Because I don't want us
to adopt the baby.

136
00:16:20,166 --> 00:16:23,522
I thought about it and I don't want
to adopt that baby.

137
00:16:23,726 --> 00:16:25,603
Or any baby, for that matter.

138
00:16:26,126 --> 00:16:29,721
I have nothing to offer him.
I'm not cut out to be a father.

139
00:16:31,446 --> 00:16:33,880
Besides, I quit my teaching job so....

140
00:16:34,086 --> 00:16:36,361
What does that have
to do with anything?

141
00:16:40,206 --> 00:16:43,677
Is there something wrong with you?
Something you haven't told me about?

142
00:16:49,407 --> 00:16:52,319
Look, if you don't want to adopt
the baby, I'll do it alone.

143
00:16:52,527 --> 00:16:54,040
You know?

144
00:17:00,287 --> 00:17:02,482
Yes, I think that would be
for the best.

145
00:17:11,247 --> 00:17:12,999
How can you do this to me?

146
00:17:13,207 --> 00:17:14,435
How can you?

147
00:17:14,647 --> 00:17:16,365
You know what that baby
means to me!

148
00:17:16,567 --> 00:17:20,480
If you didn't want to adopt him,
why'd you make me take all those tests?

149
00:17:20,687 --> 00:17:22,279
Why?

150
00:17:26,007 --> 00:17:28,965
Speak! Say something!

151
00:17:30,607 --> 00:17:32,438
I didn't make you do anything, Claudia.

152
00:17:37,687 --> 00:17:40,326
No, no, where are you going?
Where are you going?

153
00:17:40,527 --> 00:17:44,884
You're a selfish son of a bitch!
You sick fuck!

154
00:17:47,087 --> 00:17:49,157
You're gonna lock yourself
in there again?

155
00:17:51,607 --> 00:17:53,359
Open up!

156
00:17:53,567 --> 00:17:57,196
Open up, don't be a coward!

157
00:18:19,247 --> 00:18:21,203
Your office called.

158
00:18:21,407 --> 00:18:23,841
I told them you still had the flu.

159
00:18:24,607 --> 00:18:27,121
They want to know
what to do with your shift.

160
00:18:30,807 --> 00:18:32,479
Agustín!

161
00:18:32,687 --> 00:18:36,077
Come out. We have to talk.
Please, this is absurd.

162
00:18:38,487 --> 00:18:41,559
Are you going to stay in there
the rest of your life?

163
00:19:04,448 --> 00:19:07,008
Hi, I'm looking for Agustín Souto.

164
00:19:07,208 --> 00:19:09,483
This is his brother Pedro.

165
00:19:10,408 --> 00:19:13,798
They gave me this number
at the clinic.

166
00:19:14,008 --> 00:19:17,159
Anyway, I don't know....

167
00:19:18,688 --> 00:19:20,485
I'll call again later.

168
00:19:42,648 --> 00:19:44,878
I'm going to Rosario.

169
00:19:45,968 --> 00:19:48,277
When I get back,
I'll stay at my sister's.

170
00:19:50,848 --> 00:19:54,397
I've been thinking, and I'm going
to put the apartment up for sale.

171
00:19:58,368 --> 00:20:03,078
Agustín, you know you're not well.
You need to get help.

172
00:21:08,329 --> 00:21:11,287
Another Kidnapping in Tigre

173
00:21:38,569 --> 00:21:39,558
Hi.

174
00:21:40,289 --> 00:21:41,438
What's up, asshole?

175
00:21:52,129 --> 00:21:53,847
What's with the beard?

176
00:21:58,609 --> 00:22:00,406
Guess I'll have to shave mine, then.

177
00:22:08,449 --> 00:22:11,964
What the hell happened?
Maid didn't show up?

178
00:22:13,849 --> 00:22:16,044
Nice place. Yours?

179
00:22:16,249 --> 00:22:17,568
My wife's.

180
00:22:21,409 --> 00:22:23,001
Been together long?

181
00:22:23,209 --> 00:22:25,279
Eight years.

182
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:27,521
She's away.

183
00:22:34,289 --> 00:22:36,519
I brought you a present.

184
00:22:43,569 --> 00:22:45,048
It's from my hive.

185
00:22:45,249 --> 00:22:47,638
I make it. You'll like it.

186
00:22:48,129 --> 00:22:52,202
-You're living on the island?
-Yeah, for a while now.

187
00:22:53,129 --> 00:22:54,688
I had no idea.

188
00:23:03,610 --> 00:23:05,805
I stayed with Adrián for a while...

189
00:23:06,010 --> 00:23:08,922
...until I bought back
Grandpa's house.

190
00:23:09,730 --> 00:23:11,766
-Still hanging out with Adrián?
-Yeah.

191
00:23:13,010 --> 00:23:14,443
You should see him.

192
00:23:15,090 --> 00:23:16,603
He's changed a lot.

193
00:23:17,450 --> 00:23:19,566
He went religious on us.

194
00:23:21,050 --> 00:23:22,369
Cheers.

195
00:23:34,810 --> 00:23:36,323
What are you looking for?

196
00:23:40,650 --> 00:23:43,483
-What are you looking for?
-Wanna make spaghetti?

197
00:23:50,370 --> 00:23:51,485
Leave it, I'll do it.

198
00:24:12,530 --> 00:24:15,602
So that son of a bitch
is still on the island.

199
00:24:17,010 --> 00:24:20,082
Adrián? Where else would he go?

200
00:24:20,290 --> 00:24:23,123
And he keeps gambling
and losing like an asshole.

201
00:24:24,050 --> 00:24:26,006
He owes me a grand.

202
00:24:28,090 --> 00:24:31,127
When Mom got sick
I looked for you everywhere.

203
00:24:31,330 --> 00:24:35,084
-I left you several messages at....
-Yeah, I got them.

204
00:24:35,890 --> 00:24:37,608
So why didn't you come?

205
00:24:37,810 --> 00:24:40,005
I guess I couldn't make it.

206
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:44,279
I don't get it.

207
00:24:45,170 --> 00:24:47,923
You came to Dad's funeral.
What about Mom?

208
00:24:49,450 --> 00:24:52,328
We had her here, bedridden,
for a year and a half.

209
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:57,562
She couldn't recognize anyone
at the end. She'd get violent.

210
00:24:58,491 --> 00:25:00,322
And you know what?

211
00:25:00,531 --> 00:25:03,489
All she did was ask about you.

212
00:25:16,491 --> 00:25:18,163
What does your wife do?

213
00:25:18,371 --> 00:25:20,680
Why are you here?

214
00:25:32,291 --> 00:25:33,406
I have cancer.

215
00:25:34,291 --> 00:25:35,849
I've had it for a while.

216
00:25:39,531 --> 00:25:41,283
Have you seen a doctor?

217
00:25:50,851 --> 00:25:53,763
I'm having a rough time, you know?

218
00:26:02,091 --> 00:26:04,082
I need your help.

219
00:26:17,171 --> 00:26:20,720
Or you could get me a prescription.
I don't know.

220
00:26:20,931 --> 00:26:23,206
I can't do it alone.

221
00:26:25,771 --> 00:26:28,683
Been a long time
since I asked you for anything.

222
00:26:32,171 --> 00:26:34,639
Maybe it would be better
to do it on the island.

223
00:26:34,851 --> 00:26:38,321
Nobody asks questions there,
they're very discreet.

224
00:26:40,651 --> 00:26:45,930
Aside from the moral compensation,
there's money. 70,000 pesos.

225
00:26:46,131 --> 00:26:47,849
They'll leave it in the beehive...

226
00:26:48,051 --> 00:26:49,530
...behind my house.

227
00:26:50,491 --> 00:26:53,528
You'll find a package
stuck under one of the hive lids.

228
00:26:53,731 --> 00:26:56,484
That's if they pay me, of course.

229
00:27:01,451 --> 00:27:02,805
Well?

230
00:27:04,612 --> 00:27:06,409
What do you say?

231
00:27:12,612 --> 00:27:15,888
I didn't know beekeeping
was so profitable.

232
00:28:05,212 --> 00:28:08,124
This book is mine, isn't it?

233
00:28:10,772 --> 00:28:11,761
No.

234
00:28:13,012 --> 00:28:14,764
-No?
-No.

235
00:28:21,332 --> 00:28:23,607
It's a shitty novel anyway.

236
00:28:25,412 --> 00:28:27,767
Guess whose boat I bought.

237
00:28:30,132 --> 00:28:32,123
Old man Rapaport's?

238
00:28:33,972 --> 00:28:35,200
The very same.

239
00:28:35,732 --> 00:28:37,006
No kidding!

240
00:28:38,812 --> 00:28:40,768
That was a nice boat.

241
00:28:41,412 --> 00:28:43,972
Remember when we stole it
to go to Carmelo?

242
00:28:46,252 --> 00:28:49,881
-When we got back, he wanted to kill us.
-Yeah.

243
00:28:52,292 --> 00:28:53,805
Rapaport....

244
00:28:54,772 --> 00:28:56,649
He was a legend.

245
00:28:58,572 --> 00:28:59,891
Amazing he's still alive.

246
00:29:00,092 --> 00:29:04,005
No, he died a year and a half ago.

247
00:29:04,212 --> 00:29:05,770
Cancer too.

248
00:29:18,653 --> 00:29:20,166
I put a Mercury on it.

249
00:29:21,173 --> 00:29:23,562
A 25-horse. Basic.

250
00:29:31,293 --> 00:29:32,282
Anyway....

251
00:29:33,093 --> 00:29:35,482
Pass me a towel, would you?

252
00:29:47,173 --> 00:29:48,686
What are you doing, asshole?

253
00:30:06,973 --> 00:30:08,770
I'll call for help.

254
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,089
No. No!

255
00:32:58,574 --> 00:32:59,848
Look, Dad.

256
00:34:23,095 --> 00:34:24,528
Pedro!

257
00:34:30,735 --> 00:34:31,770
Excuse me.

258
00:36:39,136 --> 00:36:41,092
The Refuge

259
00:41:11,058 --> 00:41:12,252
Hello.

260
00:41:13,018 --> 00:41:14,531
Hello.

261
00:41:24,938 --> 00:41:26,417
How's it going?

262
00:41:27,698 --> 00:41:28,926
Fine.

263
00:41:35,219 --> 00:41:36,652
Tea and....

264
00:41:37,579 --> 00:41:40,651
-And yerba mate?
-Yerba? Sure.

265
00:41:43,339 --> 00:41:44,852
This one, right?

266
00:41:45,979 --> 00:41:47,173
Yeah.

267
00:41:47,379 --> 00:41:48,414
Yeah.

268
00:41:48,619 --> 00:41:51,929
And a box of matches, please.

269
00:41:57,499 --> 00:41:59,649
If you hear anything let us know.

270
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,770
That'll do it. What do I owe you?

271
00:42:10,979 --> 00:42:12,537
What's up, Pedro?

272
00:42:15,179 --> 00:42:16,168
How are you?

273
00:42:16,379 --> 00:42:18,176
Fine, I guess.

274
00:42:20,179 --> 00:42:21,373
19.50.

275
00:42:29,939 --> 00:42:32,658
-Can you change this?
-Yes.

276
00:42:37,699 --> 00:42:41,533
Tell me, have you by any chance seen...

277
00:42:41,779 --> 00:42:44,247
...your friend Adrián Ortiz?

278
00:42:45,299 --> 00:42:46,971
No.

279
00:42:48,019 --> 00:42:49,532
The thing is...

280
00:42:50,339 --> 00:42:52,807
...you can't trust anybody anymore.

281
00:42:54,139 --> 00:42:56,016
Everyone knows each other
around here.

282
00:42:56,219 --> 00:42:59,450
If you hang out with that guy
you must be a piece of shit too.

283
00:42:59,659 --> 00:43:01,570
So you haven't heard
from that bastard?

284
00:43:02,939 --> 00:43:04,338
No.

285
00:43:04,619 --> 00:43:06,018
No.

286
00:43:07,179 --> 00:43:08,817
Well....

287
00:43:10,379 --> 00:43:13,371
If you do hear from him,
we'd like to know.

288
00:43:13,579 --> 00:43:17,777
And if you don't want to cooperate,
out of respect...

289
00:43:17,979 --> 00:43:20,539
...until my father's case is solved...

290
00:43:20,779 --> 00:43:23,657
...don't show your face around here.
You got it?

291
00:43:23,859 --> 00:43:25,770
Okay, fine.

292
00:43:30,619 --> 00:43:33,452
Don't bring your honey anymore.
We don't want it.

293
00:43:45,260 --> 00:43:47,774
-You're letting him go?
-What do you want me to do?

294
00:43:51,660 --> 00:43:54,254
You've got nothing to say?
You're full of shit!

295
00:43:54,460 --> 00:43:56,132
-Stop it!
-Why'd you kill my father?

296
00:43:56,340 --> 00:43:57,898
Let me go!

297
00:43:58,100 --> 00:43:59,772
Leave him alone!

298
00:44:00,060 --> 00:44:02,051
What are you doing?
Are you crazy?

299
00:44:02,260 --> 00:44:03,978
Get out! Get out of here!

300
00:44:04,180 --> 00:44:05,693
Get out, you hear me?

301
00:44:08,020 --> 00:44:10,454
Get back. Wait a minute!

302
00:44:15,100 --> 00:44:17,409
Tell your friend we know it was him...

303
00:44:17,580 --> 00:44:20,253
...and even if we can't prove it
we'll be waiting for him.

304
00:44:23,740 --> 00:44:25,810
Get out, you piece of shit.

305
00:44:26,020 --> 00:44:27,373
That's enough!

306
00:45:20,780 --> 00:45:22,611
Anybody home?

307
00:45:25,580 --> 00:45:27,889
I came to see how you're doing.

308
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,099
I brought your things.

309
00:45:35,420 --> 00:45:37,092
Thanks.

310
00:45:37,780 --> 00:45:39,179
Did you put ice on it?

311
00:45:39,380 --> 00:45:40,972
Yeah.

312
00:45:41,620 --> 00:45:43,498
No, it's fine.

313
00:46:01,661 --> 00:46:04,050
Why did you go to the El Dorado?

314
00:46:06,741 --> 00:46:08,174
I don't know.

315
00:46:16,701 --> 00:46:20,137
-Did they sting you?
-A little.

316
00:46:21,181 --> 00:46:23,092
Don't. I can do it.

317
00:46:33,101 --> 00:46:36,491
We need to buy more beeswax.
We're running low.

318
00:46:36,701 --> 00:46:38,293
I can go get it if you want.

319
00:46:38,501 --> 00:46:40,093
Okay.

320
00:46:42,461 --> 00:46:44,179
Sure you'll be okay?

321
00:46:44,581 --> 00:46:46,651
Yeah, yeah, go ahead.

322
00:46:48,541 --> 00:46:50,099
Bye.

323
00:48:16,502 --> 00:48:18,458
FOR SALE

324
00:48:36,742 --> 00:48:38,460
Is that the window facing the street?

325
00:48:38,662 --> 00:48:40,095
Yes.

326
00:48:47,942 --> 00:48:49,170
Hello?

327
00:50:24,943 --> 00:50:26,979
Agustín!

328
00:50:27,183 --> 00:50:29,378
Agustín!

329
00:50:29,583 --> 00:50:30,732
Here, this tree will do.

330
00:50:30,943 --> 00:50:32,342
Stop. What are you doing?

331
00:50:32,543 --> 00:50:36,536
You sit here, we'll take this rope
and tie you up.

332
00:50:36,743 --> 00:50:39,780
-Let's go, Pedro. Leave him here.
-We'll be back later, Agustín.

333
00:50:39,983 --> 00:50:42,099
-You're gonna leave me here?
-Don't be a baby.

334
00:50:42,303 --> 00:50:44,214
Come back, Adrián!

335
00:50:44,423 --> 00:50:46,459
-Don't leave me here alone!
-Bye, Agustín.

336
00:50:46,663 --> 00:50:48,255
Chickenshit!

337
00:50:48,463 --> 00:50:49,942
See you, chicken.

338
00:50:53,863 --> 00:50:55,376
Hi.

339
00:51:09,223 --> 00:51:10,656
Come.

340
00:51:32,143 --> 00:51:33,974
Did you find what I left for you?

341
00:51:39,983 --> 00:51:41,336
Yeah.

342
00:51:42,823 --> 00:51:44,541
That's all they gave us.

343
00:51:46,343 --> 00:51:48,299
My godfather didn't want
to ask for more...

344
00:51:48,503 --> 00:51:50,255
...and he went into hiding.

345
00:51:51,943 --> 00:51:53,899
I don't know when he'll be back.

346
00:52:20,504 --> 00:52:22,096
Wanna do it?

347
00:52:22,464 --> 00:52:24,136
Yes.

348
00:52:31,984 --> 00:52:34,623
Look how dark it is.

349
00:52:36,464 --> 00:52:39,934
Must be the knotweed
that's still blooming.

350
00:52:42,744 --> 00:52:44,097
Beautiful.

351
00:52:52,424 --> 00:52:57,293
Ever since you went by the store
the Mendizabal brothers are acting strange.

352
00:52:57,664 --> 00:52:59,894
The police came by the other day.

353
00:53:00,104 --> 00:53:02,015
They called them.

354
00:53:02,464 --> 00:53:06,537
They wanted to know where you were
the day the ransom was paid.

355
00:53:08,024 --> 00:53:13,576
I told them you went fishing
since it wasn't windy that day...

356
00:53:13,784 --> 00:53:16,423
...but then I remembered
you had told me...

357
00:53:16,624 --> 00:53:19,502
...you were going to visit your brother.
Did you?

358
00:53:21,024 --> 00:53:22,821
Did you go see him?

359
00:53:23,784 --> 00:53:26,378
No. I didn't go.

360
00:53:35,184 --> 00:53:37,095
But what did you say?

361
00:53:38,024 --> 00:53:39,252
To the police.

362
00:53:39,464 --> 00:53:41,420
Nothing, only that.

363
00:53:41,624 --> 00:53:43,933
-What?
-That you went fishing.

364
00:53:57,144 --> 00:53:58,702
How weird.

365
00:53:59,345 --> 00:54:01,222
What?

366
00:54:03,545 --> 00:54:05,820
Nothing, really....

367
00:54:06,465 --> 00:54:07,784
You're acting weird...

368
00:54:07,985 --> 00:54:10,863
...and I thought it was because
you'd gone to see your brother.

369
00:54:39,065 --> 00:54:40,259
What an asshole.

370
00:54:51,128 --> 00:54:53,005
Why are you so late?

371
00:54:55,688 --> 00:54:57,201
I don't know.

372
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:00,359
Let's go, this way.

373
00:55:04,648 --> 00:55:06,047
Hi, Dad.

374
00:55:07,608 --> 00:55:09,200
Sit down.

375
00:55:09,888 --> 00:55:11,879
Give Daddy a kiss good night.

376
00:55:14,928 --> 00:55:17,044
May I?

377
00:55:17,288 --> 00:55:19,563
Get inside, it's cold.

378
00:55:23,048 --> 00:55:25,357
I don't think Adrián's coming back.

379
00:55:26,168 --> 00:55:28,204
We need to talk about that.

380
00:55:32,488 --> 00:55:33,762
Did you hear anything?

381
00:55:33,968 --> 00:55:36,607
Baby didn't tell you anything?

382
00:55:37,848 --> 00:55:39,281
No.

383
00:55:41,288 --> 00:55:44,519
Looks like we're on our own
this time, huh?

384
00:55:48,728 --> 00:55:51,925
You still have his gun, right?

385
00:55:55,608 --> 00:55:57,041
Yeah.

386
00:55:57,528 --> 00:56:00,565
Look, I respect my godfather...

387
00:56:01,848 --> 00:56:03,167
...but I need the money.

388
00:56:08,689 --> 00:56:10,122
Well?

389
00:56:11,049 --> 00:56:12,562
What do you say?

390
00:56:45,289 --> 00:56:46,517
What did she say?

391
00:56:50,489 --> 00:56:53,083
She said they're looking for you.

392
00:56:53,329 --> 00:56:55,240
And that you're a liar.

393
00:57:25,209 --> 00:57:27,006
Leave that, come here.

394
00:57:28,329 --> 00:57:29,808
Come here, sit down.

395
00:57:30,009 --> 00:57:32,318
It's nice and warm over here.

396
00:57:40,249 --> 00:57:42,683
It doesn't look like it's gonna rain.

397
00:57:44,249 --> 00:57:45,284
No.

398
00:57:54,809 --> 00:57:56,242
What happened to your hand?

399
00:57:56,929 --> 00:57:57,918
Nothing.

400
00:57:58,929 --> 00:58:00,965
I cut myself pulling out nails.

401
00:58:03,969 --> 00:58:05,038
Let me see.

402
00:58:05,369 --> 00:58:06,438
Show me.

403
00:58:10,370 --> 00:58:11,769
May I?

404
00:58:25,650 --> 00:58:27,925
Does it hurt when I touch it?

405
00:58:28,130 --> 00:58:29,927
Does it hurt?

406
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:31,688
No.

407
00:58:33,290 --> 00:58:36,919
When you get home,
wash it well with white soap, okay?

408
00:58:41,330 --> 00:58:45,164
Then put a clean bandage on it
so it won't get dirty.

409
00:58:46,290 --> 00:58:50,283
If it gets any redder or feels hot,
let me know.

410
00:58:51,650 --> 00:58:53,049
Yeah?

411
00:59:19,290 --> 00:59:20,848
This seems wrong to me.

412
00:59:21,930 --> 00:59:23,329
You're right.

413
00:59:25,730 --> 00:59:28,039
I'm sorry, I shouldn't have.

414
00:59:28,250 --> 00:59:30,764
You're a baby and I'm...

415
00:59:31,330 --> 00:59:33,127
...an old man.

416
00:59:34,450 --> 00:59:35,644
"Baby" my ass.

417
00:59:36,890 --> 00:59:40,041
Why do you call me that
when you know I hate it?

418
00:59:43,810 --> 00:59:46,768
I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to offend you.

419
00:59:59,450 --> 01:00:01,281
Can you pay me what you owe me?

420
01:00:04,090 --> 01:00:05,443
Sure.

421
01:00:10,290 --> 01:00:11,929
That's all I have.

422
01:00:17,931 --> 01:00:19,000
Bye.

423
01:00:39,491 --> 01:00:42,483
Good morning, Souto. How are you?

424
01:00:43,891 --> 01:00:46,610
We're looking for your friend,
Adrián Ortiz.

425
01:00:48,411 --> 01:00:50,288
Do you know where we might find him?

426
01:00:53,011 --> 01:00:54,842
I think he's on a trip.

427
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:57,281
When is he coming back?

428
01:00:59,171 --> 01:01:00,570
I don't know.

429
01:01:08,171 --> 01:01:10,127
You can't come into my
house like this.

430
01:01:11,691 --> 01:01:12,806
Don't get excited.

431
01:01:13,011 --> 01:01:16,162
Search warrant and arrest warrant.
Everything is in order.

432
01:01:16,371 --> 01:01:18,441
I assume you know your rights.

433
01:01:38,931 --> 01:01:41,525
Can you tell me
what you're looking for?

434
01:01:41,851 --> 01:01:43,887
What should we be looking for?

435
01:01:46,331 --> 01:01:47,684
Souto.

436
01:01:47,891 --> 01:01:50,200
Haven't seen you in a while.

437
01:01:50,411 --> 01:01:52,322
Give me your other hand.

438
01:02:00,531 --> 01:02:02,567
He's all set. Pass me the keys.

439
01:02:03,611 --> 01:02:05,602
Here, take him.

440
01:02:06,891 --> 01:02:07,960
Wipe your hands.

441
01:02:21,092 --> 01:02:22,764
Sit down.

442
01:02:29,812 --> 01:02:31,848
I got it, leave me the keys.

443
01:02:36,012 --> 01:02:37,650
This is from Ortiz.

444
01:02:39,372 --> 01:02:40,521
He says to hang in there.

445
01:02:43,692 --> 01:02:46,001
If you don't talk,
they'll let you out sooner.

446
01:03:07,252 --> 01:03:08,651
Well?

447
01:03:08,852 --> 01:03:10,285
Fishing.

448
01:03:11,532 --> 01:03:14,968
-I don't know which river.
-Tough guy, huh?

449
01:03:15,532 --> 01:03:17,488
Think about it, Souto.

450
01:03:17,692 --> 01:03:20,286
Tell me who you were with
the night the ransom was paid.

451
01:03:21,332 --> 01:03:23,482
Give us a name
and we'll leave you alone.

452
01:03:25,012 --> 01:03:28,527
I already told you. I was alone.

453
01:03:31,172 --> 01:03:32,844
Ask him again.

454
01:03:33,652 --> 01:03:35,244
Ask him again!

455
01:04:47,013 --> 01:04:48,605
Wait here.

456
01:04:52,493 --> 01:04:55,053
Souto. You have a visitor.

457
01:05:01,853 --> 01:05:03,366
You've got half an hour.

458
01:05:07,373 --> 01:05:08,442
Hi.

459
01:05:10,413 --> 01:05:11,687
Hi.

460
01:05:14,013 --> 01:05:15,844
I'm Agustín's wife.

461
01:05:33,653 --> 01:05:35,166
I came because...

462
01:05:38,573 --> 01:05:40,291
...your brother passed away.

463
01:05:40,493 --> 01:05:41,926
A month ago.

464
01:05:42,893 --> 01:05:46,044
Yeah, I know.
I saw the obituary in the paper.

465
01:05:50,173 --> 01:05:51,606
Did you know he was sick?

466
01:05:54,573 --> 01:05:55,847
Yeah.

467
01:05:57,533 --> 01:05:59,410
He did mention something.

468
01:06:07,533 --> 01:06:09,444
Did you hold a wake for him?

469
01:06:11,773 --> 01:06:13,604
Yes, of course.

470
01:06:14,493 --> 01:06:17,769
And we-- We cremated him.

471
01:06:19,453 --> 01:06:23,844
We'd never discussed it,
but I thought it was best.

472
01:06:33,934 --> 01:06:36,368
I still can't believe he's gone.

473
01:06:40,334 --> 01:06:42,404
I feel so guilty....

474
01:06:48,534 --> 01:06:49,853
Guilty of what?

475
01:06:50,654 --> 01:06:53,293
I left him when he was suffering.

476
01:06:53,494 --> 01:06:56,372
I can't forgive myself for that.

477
01:07:06,334 --> 01:07:08,131
-Here.
-Thanks.

478
01:07:24,774 --> 01:07:27,811
None of this is your fault, Claudia.

479
01:07:59,774 --> 01:08:02,334
I found this at home.

480
01:08:02,534 --> 01:08:04,172
Is it yours?

481
01:08:08,494 --> 01:08:11,566
Maybe you went to visit
your brother and don't remember.

482
01:08:18,734 --> 01:08:19,883
I'd rather keep it.

483
01:08:28,614 --> 01:08:29,934
I don't....

484
01:08:31,175 --> 01:08:32,164
Claudia....

485
01:08:32,375 --> 01:08:35,094
Don't say anything, Agustín.
What are you going to explain?

486
01:08:35,295 --> 01:08:37,411
This is all so...

487
01:08:38,015 --> 01:08:39,767
...so horrible.

488
01:08:45,095 --> 01:08:48,167
I'm not Agustín. I'm Pedro.

489
01:08:48,335 --> 01:08:49,324
Shut up!

490
01:08:49,535 --> 01:08:52,652
Shut up, for God's sake.
What are you doing?

491
01:08:53,335 --> 01:08:55,053
What are you doing?

492
01:09:04,495 --> 01:09:06,292
What are you going to do?

493
01:09:08,015 --> 01:09:09,448
-Sir!
-What are you going to do?

494
01:09:09,655 --> 01:09:13,125
What do you care?
What do you care?

495
01:09:13,335 --> 01:09:16,247
Why should I tell you
what I'm going to do?

496
01:09:16,455 --> 01:09:18,173
Why?

497
01:09:26,495 --> 01:09:29,373
They're giving me the baby soon.

498
01:09:32,815 --> 01:09:34,726
-Is there a problem?
-Open the door.

499
01:09:34,935 --> 01:09:37,324
-Open the door, please!
-Something wrong, ma'am?

500
01:09:39,055 --> 01:09:40,488
What's the problem?

501
01:09:41,535 --> 01:09:42,809
Nothing.

502
01:10:20,855 --> 01:10:22,129
Let's go.

503
01:10:27,895 --> 01:10:29,044
-You all set?
-Yeah.

504
01:10:29,255 --> 01:10:30,927
Come on, let's go.

505
01:10:34,416 --> 01:10:36,611
This one's for my father.

506
01:10:39,016 --> 01:10:41,166
Burn in hell, Ortiz!

507
01:12:47,217 --> 01:12:48,616
What are you drinking?

508
01:12:48,817 --> 01:12:51,251
-Beer.
-Two.

509
01:12:54,177 --> 01:12:56,566
Hi, Rosa. Everything okay?

510
01:13:08,457 --> 01:13:10,288
To you getting out.

511
01:13:10,937 --> 01:13:11,926
Happy birthday.

512
01:13:18,777 --> 01:13:20,256
How old are you now?

513
01:13:20,457 --> 01:13:21,970
Twenty-one.

514
01:13:22,657 --> 01:13:24,887
I look older, don't I?

515
01:13:31,457 --> 01:13:33,846
When do you start work
at the supermarket?

516
01:13:34,057 --> 01:13:36,446
I started Monday as a stock girl.

517
01:13:38,417 --> 01:13:40,977
You don't work
at the El Dorado anymore?

518
01:13:41,177 --> 01:13:42,895
-They fired me.
-What?

519
01:13:43,097 --> 01:13:44,450
They fired me!

520
01:14:05,657 --> 01:14:08,091
They say it brings good luck.

521
01:14:11,137 --> 01:14:13,287
-Can you help me?
-Sure.

522
01:14:26,577 --> 01:14:27,976
There.

523
01:14:32,377 --> 01:14:34,049
Thanks.

524
01:14:40,577 --> 01:14:43,809
Do you think it's possible to live
without hurting others?

525
01:14:44,618 --> 01:14:49,169
I know it's hard,
but I think we should try.

526
01:14:49,378 --> 01:14:52,973
There's evil in all of us,
that's just how it is.

527
01:14:53,178 --> 01:14:55,772
But if we hurt others,
make them suffer...

528
01:14:55,978 --> 01:14:58,890
...the evil grows, it gets stronger.

529
01:15:00,178 --> 01:15:02,931
On the other hand,
if we're good to others...

530
01:15:03,138 --> 01:15:05,891
...the evil inside us shrinks...

531
01:15:06,098 --> 01:15:08,373
...and the evil in others too.

532
01:15:13,258 --> 01:15:15,294
That's my plan.

533
01:15:24,098 --> 01:15:26,407
To be good to others,
no matter who they are.

534
01:15:28,098 --> 01:15:29,451
Yeah.

535
01:15:30,298 --> 01:15:31,936
That's good.

536
01:15:36,298 --> 01:15:38,334
So, what's your plan?

537
01:15:41,378 --> 01:15:43,573
I don't have a plan.

538
01:17:47,659 --> 01:17:50,378
Pedro, Agustín and their friend
Adrián - Summer 1973

539
01:18:34,019 --> 01:18:35,338
Leaving already?

540
01:18:35,539 --> 01:18:37,769
You talked in your sleep.

541
01:18:41,259 --> 01:18:42,817
What did I say?

542
01:18:44,139 --> 01:18:46,289
It sounded like you were crying.

543
01:18:47,899 --> 01:18:49,776
I don't want you to leave.

544
01:18:53,340 --> 01:18:55,934
Why don't you stay here with me?

545
01:19:04,820 --> 01:19:06,538
What if he comes back?

546
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:09,809
Who?

547
01:19:10,900 --> 01:19:12,811
The boogeyman.

548
01:19:54,740 --> 01:19:57,049
-How's it going?
-What's up?

549
01:20:17,540 --> 01:20:19,019
You look good.

550
01:20:24,380 --> 01:20:27,133
Rubén told me you're reformed.

551
01:20:31,580 --> 01:20:35,209
They're looking for you.
Did he tell you that?

552
01:20:36,700 --> 01:20:38,895
Yeah, he did.

553
01:20:44,980 --> 01:20:46,413
Well?

554
01:20:47,820 --> 01:20:49,890
Aren't you gonna offer me a drink?

555
01:20:55,181 --> 01:20:56,773
I'll be right back.

556
01:22:00,341 --> 01:22:02,980
Well, look who's here.

557
01:22:20,981 --> 01:22:22,699
I sure missed you!

558
01:22:25,581 --> 01:22:28,015
Who wouldn't miss Baby?

559
01:22:29,221 --> 01:22:30,654
Have you been a good girl?

560
01:22:30,861 --> 01:22:33,853
Rosa, take those things
to the beehive, please.

561
01:22:40,301 --> 01:22:41,495
Let me go.

562
01:22:42,341 --> 01:22:43,376
Leave her alone!

563
01:22:47,741 --> 01:22:48,935
Go on.

564
01:22:53,861 --> 01:22:56,421
You have something that belongs to me.

565
01:22:56,621 --> 01:22:59,739
Or did you throw it in the river
like a chickenshit?

566
01:23:06,702 --> 01:23:08,135
Come on.

567
01:23:25,342 --> 01:23:27,014
Here.

568
01:23:29,702 --> 01:23:33,012
I have some unfinished business
with the fairies from the El Dorado.

569
01:23:33,222 --> 01:23:34,814
Coming with me?

570
01:23:36,022 --> 01:23:37,978
What about the grand you owe me?

571
01:24:09,422 --> 01:24:13,097
"Not one stone shall be left standing.

572
01:24:13,502 --> 01:24:17,211
And when you see
the desolate abomination...

573
01:24:17,422 --> 01:24:21,734
...those who can
may flee to the mountains.

574
01:24:27,742 --> 01:24:31,860
And what I say unto you
I say unto all:

575
01:24:32,062 --> 01:24:36,852
Look, watch and pray."

576
01:24:39,822 --> 01:24:41,540
Word of the Lord.

577
01:24:55,062 --> 01:24:57,701
The family leaves
with the boat at 1630.

578
01:24:57,902 --> 01:25:01,212
They drop off the girl
at tennis class and go to play golf.

579
01:25:01,422 --> 01:25:05,018
The security guards pass at 1650.
More or less.

580
01:25:05,223 --> 01:25:07,134
1650.

581
01:25:07,343 --> 01:25:09,174
That's when...

582
01:25:09,383 --> 01:25:10,782
...Pedro...

583
01:25:10,983 --> 01:25:13,133
...goes in with the jars of honey.

584
01:25:16,663 --> 01:25:19,860
Wait for the maid to shut off
the security cameras...

585
01:25:20,063 --> 01:25:22,577
...go in the kitchen
and close the curtains.

586
01:25:23,023 --> 01:25:25,139
That's the sign Rubén
will be waiting for...

587
01:25:25,343 --> 01:25:26,776
...hiding in the boat.

588
01:25:27,743 --> 01:25:30,940
Then he'll signal me
on the other side of the pier.

589
01:25:31,143 --> 01:25:33,657
I'll go inside and cut the power.

590
01:25:33,943 --> 01:25:37,413
The maid won't notice anything
because the lights will be off.

591
01:25:38,543 --> 01:25:39,862
Any questions?

592
01:25:44,383 --> 01:25:45,816
What?

593
01:25:47,703 --> 01:25:49,421
How can I signal you...

594
01:25:49,623 --> 01:25:53,775
...if I'm crouching
so the guards won't see me?

595
01:25:54,783 --> 01:25:55,772
That's right.

596
01:25:55,983 --> 01:25:57,780
It's too complicated.

597
01:25:59,463 --> 01:26:03,775
You stand up and then crouch again!
That's how!

598
01:26:07,663 --> 01:26:09,619
I think we should grab
the daughter.

599
01:26:09,823 --> 01:26:12,383
She goes home alone
from her tennis class.

600
01:26:13,303 --> 01:26:16,022
There's less risk and more money.

601
01:26:16,983 --> 01:26:18,496
I don't know.

602
01:26:19,703 --> 01:26:21,295
I'm just saying.

603
01:26:22,503 --> 01:26:25,176
This kid is an airhead...

604
01:26:26,223 --> 01:26:29,738
...but I can't abandon him
because he's my godson.

605
01:26:33,943 --> 01:26:35,012
Remember...

606
01:26:35,223 --> 01:26:37,418
...how much fun we had here?

607
01:26:37,623 --> 01:26:40,091
I always remember those years.

608
01:26:40,823 --> 01:26:43,291
I missed you two a lot
when you left.

609
01:26:44,103 --> 01:26:47,891
We weren't bad kids,
just a little wild.

610
01:26:48,823 --> 01:26:53,533
But Agustín was very spoiled...

611
01:26:53,743 --> 01:26:56,621
...with that holier-than-thou attitude.

612
01:26:56,823 --> 01:27:01,135
He made you want to spit on him,
beat him up....

613
01:27:01,343 --> 01:27:03,220
He always was a chickenshit.

614
01:27:06,063 --> 01:27:07,496
You're drunk.

615
01:27:07,703 --> 01:27:10,013
-You're getting sentimental.
-No, not us!

616
01:27:10,784 --> 01:27:12,740
We weren't squeamish.

617
01:27:12,944 --> 01:27:17,222
Nothing scared us.
Not pain, getting beat up.

618
01:27:17,424 --> 01:27:19,779
Maybe it was jealousy.

619
01:27:26,104 --> 01:27:28,572
Because deep down
he was always a loser.

620
01:27:32,704 --> 01:27:34,183
What are you after?

621
01:27:35,944 --> 01:27:37,218
And you?

622
01:27:39,184 --> 01:27:41,175
What are you after?

623
01:28:29,904 --> 01:28:32,020
Why don't we get out of here?

624
01:28:33,104 --> 01:28:34,583
And go where?

625
01:28:35,584 --> 01:28:37,176
Upriver.

626
01:28:44,944 --> 01:28:46,616
I don't know....

627
01:29:05,624 --> 01:29:07,899
What do we do once inside?

628
01:29:09,824 --> 01:29:12,783
Stay close to me
and don't do anything stupid.

629
01:29:16,585 --> 01:29:18,496
Tell me, Pedro.

630
01:29:20,745 --> 01:29:23,623
How much money
did you say there might be?

631
01:29:39,625 --> 01:29:41,138
The girl's tasty.

632
01:29:42,225 --> 01:29:44,864
She must be around
the same age as Baby.

633
01:29:46,225 --> 01:29:48,295
Baby gets me hotter, though.

634
01:29:55,905 --> 01:29:58,738
You don't like me
calling her that either?

635
01:30:00,745 --> 01:30:04,215
I don't care what you call her,
just stop bothering her.

636
01:30:04,425 --> 01:30:06,541
Leave her alone.

637
01:30:07,105 --> 01:30:11,542
Why are you defending her?
You have no idea.

638
01:30:11,745 --> 01:30:14,134
Tell me, what do you know
about Baby?

639
01:30:16,705 --> 01:30:19,424
What's that rat been telling you
about me?

640
01:31:26,906 --> 01:31:30,376
I put on the boots Adrián gave me
and started dancing.

641
01:31:36,786 --> 01:31:39,016
Adrián, you're a drone.

642
01:31:40,906 --> 01:31:44,296
Drones don't have stingers
or odor.

643
01:31:44,746 --> 01:31:48,705
That's why they can enter any hive,
bringing diseases.

644
01:31:52,546 --> 01:31:55,379
Do I always end up alone?

645
01:32:21,586 --> 01:32:23,338
Do you love me?

646
01:32:24,666 --> 01:32:25,894
Yes.

647
01:32:28,586 --> 01:32:30,497
Will you always love me?

648
01:32:34,426 --> 01:32:35,575
Always.

649
01:32:37,986 --> 01:32:40,864
Even if I get old and wrinkled?

650
01:33:01,386 --> 01:33:03,946
Were you with him for the money?

651
01:33:05,026 --> 01:33:06,857
Or did you like it?

652
01:33:18,826 --> 01:33:20,544
A little bit of both.

653
01:33:43,987 --> 01:33:45,306
What do you mean no?

654
01:33:45,907 --> 01:33:47,579
No means no.

655
01:33:48,067 --> 01:33:49,898
Count me out.

656
01:33:51,027 --> 01:33:52,699
I'm not going to do it.

657
01:33:52,907 --> 01:33:56,456
Why? Is it Adrián?

658
01:33:57,427 --> 01:34:02,137
It's a long story, Rubén.
I just don't think it's a good idea.

659
01:34:02,867 --> 01:34:04,539
But it was your idea to begin with.

660
01:34:06,067 --> 01:34:09,377
It seemed good at the time,
but not anymore.

661
01:34:10,547 --> 01:34:13,505
-Finish up here, I'll be right back.
-Okay.

662
01:34:31,027 --> 01:34:33,143
How much is the spaghetti, miss?

663
01:34:33,347 --> 01:34:35,815
What brand would you recommend?

664
01:34:36,227 --> 01:34:38,695
What do you want, Adrián? I'm working.

665
01:34:38,907 --> 01:34:40,545
It's just a joke.

666
01:34:40,747 --> 01:34:43,261
Wanna go for a drink tonight?

667
01:34:44,587 --> 01:34:46,976
No, I don't think I can.

668
01:34:49,787 --> 01:34:51,584
Put on something nice.

669
01:34:52,987 --> 01:34:55,376
I'll meet you at the pier
and we'll go for a ride.

670
01:35:43,628 --> 01:35:48,019
SOUTO, Agustín
Pediatrician, died 5-5-2011

671
01:36:04,588 --> 01:36:05,907
What's going on?

672
01:36:09,068 --> 01:36:10,740
Get out!

673
01:36:28,508 --> 01:36:30,817
I won't hurt you.

674
01:36:32,628 --> 01:36:34,823
It's okay, it's okay.

675
01:36:43,268 --> 01:36:45,304
Son of a bitch.

676
01:38:26,429 --> 01:38:27,828
Hi.

677
01:38:29,749 --> 01:38:31,705
It took you long enough.

678
01:38:31,909 --> 01:38:34,184
We thought you were dead.

679
01:38:34,389 --> 01:38:36,539
Well, actually, you are dead, right?

680
01:38:40,909 --> 01:38:41,898
Come in.

681
01:38:43,069 --> 01:38:44,627
Come in!

682
01:38:57,029 --> 01:38:59,020
You missed the party.

683
01:39:06,029 --> 01:39:08,304
You didn't have to involve her in all this.

684
01:39:09,109 --> 01:39:10,781
It was her idea.

685
01:39:11,429 --> 01:39:12,578
Tell him.

686
01:39:15,669 --> 01:39:18,661
They're asking for the ransom all at once.

687
01:39:19,469 --> 01:39:22,188
When it's paid, I'll pick it up.

688
01:39:22,709 --> 01:39:25,064
If everything goes well, he'll let me go.

689
01:39:30,349 --> 01:39:32,226
And you'll stay with me.

690
01:39:35,350 --> 01:39:36,942
Did you bring her?

691
01:39:38,030 --> 01:39:40,988
Yeah, she's in my boat.

692
01:39:41,910 --> 01:39:43,582
Make yourself comfortable.

693
01:39:44,310 --> 01:39:46,062
Sit down.

694
01:39:48,830 --> 01:39:49,979
Fix him a drink.

695
01:39:51,190 --> 01:39:53,306
Do it!

696
01:40:01,030 --> 01:40:04,386
The little whore told me
she didn't love me.

697
01:40:05,870 --> 01:40:07,303
You were right.

698
01:40:09,230 --> 01:40:10,709
Did she tell you she loves you?

699
01:40:10,910 --> 01:40:15,028
You already have me.
Why not let her go?

700
01:40:26,230 --> 01:40:28,186
You'll never be like Pedro.

701
01:40:28,950 --> 01:40:31,259
Even though you both grew up here.

702
01:40:32,870 --> 01:40:35,668
You were never from here
and you never will be.

703
01:40:42,150 --> 01:40:43,469
You know why?

704
01:40:46,070 --> 01:40:48,664
Because you were always a chickenshit.

705
01:40:49,470 --> 01:40:51,222
And that doesn't....

706
01:40:52,110 --> 01:40:54,340
Doesn't change with time.

707
01:40:54,990 --> 01:40:57,060
Baby will always be trash...

708
01:40:57,750 --> 01:40:59,706
...my godson an idiot.

709
01:41:01,070 --> 01:41:04,824
I'll always be a pain in the ass,
whatever....

710
01:41:05,030 --> 01:41:07,942
There's no room for big changes.

711
01:41:09,750 --> 01:41:14,426
Pedro always said
that we should learn from the bees...

712
01:41:14,630 --> 01:41:17,508
...because they each have their role
in the hive...

713
01:41:17,710 --> 01:41:20,782
...from birth to death.

714
01:41:21,510 --> 01:41:23,182
He always did whatever he wanted.

715
01:41:24,710 --> 01:41:25,984
Yeah.

716
01:41:26,470 --> 01:41:28,142
He was a special guy.

717
01:41:30,310 --> 01:41:31,299
I'll miss him.

718
01:41:33,950 --> 01:41:35,702
Me too.

719
01:41:36,870 --> 01:41:38,144
You?

720
01:41:42,551 --> 01:41:44,781
He always came to me.

721
01:41:44,991 --> 01:41:46,219
Yeah.

722
01:41:46,431 --> 01:41:48,820
He respected me.

723
01:41:49,351 --> 01:41:50,704
Pedro could see...

724
01:41:50,911 --> 01:41:54,904
...and he saw something important in me
that no one else did.

725
01:41:55,911 --> 01:41:57,902
Nobody's that important, Adrián.

726
01:41:59,831 --> 01:42:00,820
No?

727
01:42:03,111 --> 01:42:04,464
No.

728
01:42:06,871 --> 01:42:08,463
Neither are you.

729
01:42:13,111 --> 01:42:15,227
Say goodbye quickly.

730
01:42:35,191 --> 01:42:36,590
Come on.

731
01:42:42,271 --> 01:42:43,386
Come on, come on!

732
01:42:53,631 --> 01:42:55,303
Let's go, let's go!

733
01:42:56,711 --> 01:42:58,064
Move it.

734
01:43:00,551 --> 01:43:03,623
What are you doing?
Keep an eye on him.

735
01:43:07,351 --> 01:43:10,024
It was his idea to bring Rosa.

736
01:43:10,391 --> 01:43:13,030
-I told him not to, but you know him.
-Rubén!

737
01:43:13,231 --> 01:43:15,187
Put down the firewood
and watch him!

738
01:43:36,991 --> 01:43:39,266
Stop! Stop!

739
01:43:39,471 --> 01:43:40,460
Stop!

740
01:45:08,352 --> 01:45:09,944
Rosa.

741
01:45:11,112 --> 01:45:12,625
I'm here.

742
01:45:52,593 --> 01:45:54,584
Do you love me?

743
01:45:56,993 --> 01:45:58,426
Yes.

744
01:46:03,593 --> 01:46:05,902
I love you very much.

745
01:46:06,513 --> 01:46:08,071
You know?

746
01:46:13,073 --> 01:46:14,950
I love you too.

747
01:46:27,513 --> 01:46:31,301
Will you always love me?

748
01:46:49,193 --> 01:46:51,184
Always.
