1
00:01:41,768 --> 00:01:44,293
Okay.

2
00:01:44,370 --> 00:01:46,861
Okay.

3
00:02:00,487 --> 00:02:05,322
Oh, honey,
my earring... caught.

4
00:02:06,459 --> 00:02:09,986
Slow down. Slow down.

5
00:02:12,065 --> 00:02:15,125
Oh, shit.
It's Ali. Damn it!

6
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:20,830
No, honey.
No. I really have to go.

7
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,010
I'm really sorry, honey.

8
00:02:26,079 --> 00:02:27,444
I'm really sorry.

9
00:02:27,514 --> 00:02:29,675
I'll have to see you next week,
okay, babe?

10
00:02:29,749 --> 00:02:31,410
Listen...

11
00:02:32,585 --> 00:02:34,177
Bye.

12
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:36,654
Bye!

13
00:02:46,399 --> 00:02:47,559
I sometimes wonder

14
00:02:47,634 --> 00:02:50,125
if my life is always gonna be
like this...

15
00:02:50,203 --> 00:02:52,797
kind of rough around the edges.

16
00:02:52,872 --> 00:02:55,966
That's what my Aunt Rebecca
would say.

17
00:02:56,042 --> 00:02:57,737
That's who I live with...

18
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:59,801
her and her girlfriend Vicky.

19
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:03,406
Just your normal, typical,
regular lesbo household.

20
00:03:03,483 --> 00:03:06,850
My aunt's always nagging me
about school,

21
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:09,388
always telling me to plan
for the future.

22
00:03:11,457 --> 00:03:12,856
But, you know...

23
00:03:12,926 --> 00:03:16,418
the problem with me is...
I live in the present.

24
00:03:16,496 --> 00:03:17,986
You got to be in the moment.

25
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:19,998
Hey, guys, I'm home!

26
00:03:20,066 --> 00:03:23,263
I'm a strong believer
in impulsive behavior.

27
00:03:23,336 --> 00:03:25,361
I don't really think about
the future much.

28
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:28,703
I mean, you can't tell
the future anyway, right?

29
00:03:32,278 --> 00:03:34,246
We made it through
another day.

30
00:03:34,314 --> 00:03:36,908
Hear, hear!

31
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:39,474
You can only be ready.

32
00:03:39,552 --> 00:03:40,985
Does rice have protein?

33
00:03:41,054 --> 00:03:42,521
May I have some?

34
00:03:42,589 --> 00:03:44,022
I'm sorry!

35
00:03:44,090 --> 00:03:46,024
Do you want beans, Randy?

36
00:03:46,092 --> 00:03:48,560
- I got it!
- Okay.

37
00:03:48,628 --> 00:03:51,529
God! Is Frank coming
over for dinner again?

38
00:03:51,598 --> 00:03:53,998
Well, his mom never
cooks for him, poor thing.

39
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,297
Hey, guys, it's Lena.

40
00:03:56,369 --> 00:03:57,927
Hey, guys.
How you doing?

41
00:04:16,055 --> 00:04:18,489
Miss Randall Dean?

42
00:04:18,558 --> 00:04:20,423
What's the cosine here?

43
00:04:20,493 --> 00:04:23,985
Um, it's...

44
00:04:24,063 --> 00:04:25,826
ahem.

45
00:04:25,898 --> 00:04:28,765
Writing another
love song, Miss Dean?

46
00:04:32,538 --> 00:04:34,506
All right.
Another student.

47
00:04:58,097 --> 00:04:59,928
Okay. No more of this.

48
00:04:59,999 --> 00:05:02,024
Oh, no, Little Miss
Hates Math.

49
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:04,899
Next time,
we're at least getting a "C."

50
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,001
It's hopeless.

51
00:05:08,074 --> 00:05:09,564
Aw, come on.

52
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:11,473
Enough of this
teen pessimism.

53
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:13,341
I have five minutes
for a pep talk.

54
00:05:13,413 --> 00:05:14,880
Okay. Number one...

55
00:05:14,947 --> 00:05:17,006
Lena moving in, right?

56
00:05:17,083 --> 00:05:18,880
- Yeah, right.
- Right?

57
00:05:18,951 --> 00:05:21,715
Um, number two... math is not
the end of the world. No.

58
00:05:21,788 --> 00:05:24,188
Okay, number three...
you got me.

59
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,315
Yeah.

60
00:05:25,391 --> 00:05:26,983
- I'll help you out, right?
- Yeah.

61
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:29,028
Okay, well, I got to go.

62
00:05:29,095 --> 00:05:31,154
I'm gonna call you later
and I'm gonna check up on you.

63
00:05:31,230 --> 00:05:32,822
Are you gonna, like,
be thinking positive?

64
00:05:32,899 --> 00:05:34,662
Will you do
my math homework for me?

65
00:05:34,734 --> 00:05:36,292
- I'll help you do your math homework.
- Please?

66
00:05:36,369 --> 00:05:38,098
- No.
- Please.

67
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:40,162
- Help. Positive?
- Yeah. Great.

68
00:05:40,239 --> 00:05:42,571
All right, I gotta go.
Gym. Ooh!

69
00:05:42,642 --> 00:05:44,166
Ooh. See ya.

70
00:05:45,611 --> 00:05:48,307
Ugh! Look who's over there...
Randy Dean.

71
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:50,144
- God!
- She's such a freak!

72
00:05:50,216 --> 00:05:51,979
Oh God, did you hear
about her family?

73
00:05:52,051 --> 00:05:54,019
They're, like,
all lesbians there.

74
00:05:54,087 --> 00:05:55,577
- Just goes to show you.
- What?

75
00:05:55,655 --> 00:05:56,781
I don't know. Whatever.

76
00:06:02,128 --> 00:06:03,561
Fuck!

77
00:06:03,629 --> 00:06:05,688
I can't fucking
understand this stuff!

78
00:06:11,571 --> 00:06:13,004
It's your life.

79
00:06:13,072 --> 00:06:14,505
What?

80
00:06:14,574 --> 00:06:17,008
I said it's your life.

81
00:06:19,645 --> 00:06:21,010
Nice car.

82
00:06:26,552 --> 00:06:28,019
All right. Fine.

83
00:06:28,087 --> 00:06:30,351
I'll handle it.

84
00:06:32,158 --> 00:06:35,355
Hi. Listen, there's
something wrong with my car.

85
00:06:35,428 --> 00:06:37,362
I don't know
exactly what it is,

86
00:06:37,430 --> 00:06:38,863
but I think it's
the back tire,

87
00:06:38,931 --> 00:06:40,558
like it's out
of air or something.

88
00:06:40,633 --> 00:06:41,964
Could you look
at it for me?

89
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:56,479
Barrier.

90
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,449
I know it looks okay,
but when you're in the car,

91
00:06:58,518 --> 00:07:01,544
you can't feel
that it's going chomp?

92
00:07:01,621 --> 00:07:03,987
I really think that
it needs air.

93
00:07:04,056 --> 00:07:05,683
She thinks
the back tire needs air.

94
00:07:05,758 --> 00:07:08,249
There's a married man
on the phone for you.

95
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:10,996
I know this
sounds weird,

96
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:13,190
but I just can't put the air
in the tires

97
00:07:13,266 --> 00:07:16,360
because I think they're going
to blow up in my face.

98
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:20,004
Well, actually, you know,
tires don't blow up

99
00:07:20,072 --> 00:07:21,972
from having air
put in them,

100
00:07:22,041 --> 00:07:23,508
but, um...

101
00:07:23,576 --> 00:07:26,101
I'll put some air in it
if you want me to.

102
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,979
Oh my God.
Thank you.

103
00:07:29,048 --> 00:07:32,017
Thank you.
I really appreciate your help.

104
00:07:32,084 --> 00:07:33,813
I'm such a spaz.

105
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,691
Are you ready?

106
00:08:01,113 --> 00:08:03,343
Okay! It's done.

107
00:08:06,519 --> 00:08:09,454
Thank you.
I'm such a spaz.

108
00:08:09,522 --> 00:08:13,481
But I really appreciate
this a lot. Thank you.

109
00:08:13,559 --> 00:08:15,789
I'm afraid of
the weirdest things.

110
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:19,497
Thanks.

111
00:08:19,565 --> 00:08:21,965
By the way, where am I?

112
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,365
Uh, middle of nowhere.

113
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:27,038
Hey, don't you go
to Wallace High School?

114
00:08:27,106 --> 00:08:28,971
You mean Wallace prison?

115
00:08:29,041 --> 00:08:30,167
Barely.

116
00:08:30,243 --> 00:08:32,905
Well, then,
I'll see you at school.

117
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:35,573
Randy. Randy Dean.

118
00:08:35,648 --> 00:08:37,616
You know,
like as in James Dean?

119
00:08:37,683 --> 00:08:39,844
- Oh.
- He's my uncle.

120
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:41,079
Really?

121
00:08:41,153 --> 00:08:42,120
Just kidding.

122
00:08:43,155 --> 00:08:45,487
All right.
Well, I'll see you at school.

123
00:08:45,558 --> 00:08:46,855
The big house, I mean.

124
00:08:46,926 --> 00:08:48,894
See ya.

125
00:09:22,028 --> 00:09:23,495
Ahem.

126
00:09:23,563 --> 00:09:27,590
Evie, why haven't we
seen each other?

127
00:09:27,667 --> 00:09:28,998
Why?

128
00:09:29,068 --> 00:09:32,868
Why is the sky blue,
okay?

129
00:09:32,939 --> 00:09:33,997
Why does the Earth turn?

130
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:35,472
Why are people
the way they are?

131
00:09:35,541 --> 00:09:37,975
- Why isn't anyone fighting for change?
- I don't know.

132
00:09:38,044 --> 00:09:40,035
Why does Ted always
tell you what to do?

133
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:41,875
Why do you always
listen to him?

134
00:09:41,948 --> 00:09:44,508
Wait a minute.
I'm asking you a simple question.

135
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:45,949
It deserves
a simple answer.

136
00:09:46,018 --> 00:09:47,485
Why haven't you
even called me?

137
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:54,355
Fine. Shut me out.

138
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,192
Listen...

139
00:09:57,263 --> 00:10:00,164
Go ahead.
Just shut me...

140
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:05,536
Hayjay?

141
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:07,038
Yes.

142
00:10:07,106 --> 00:10:09,540
People are
watching you, Hayjay.

143
00:10:09,609 --> 00:10:10,974
Yeah, like I was saying.

144
00:10:11,043 --> 00:10:13,637
I'll call you when
I'm good and ready.

145
00:10:25,491 --> 00:10:27,459
Okay, Miss Dean.

146
00:10:27,526 --> 00:10:29,551
Why don't you
take five minutes outside?

147
00:10:29,629 --> 00:10:30,994
Go sit in the hallway

148
00:10:31,063 --> 00:10:33,054
and think about the situation
that you're in

149
00:10:33,132 --> 00:10:35,066
and how you could
possibly change it.

150
00:10:35,134 --> 00:10:36,567
After a few minutes have passed,

151
00:10:36,636 --> 00:10:39,070
you will be allowed
back in class.

152
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:42,301
This is the 10th time
in the last few weeks

153
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,774
you've been late for class.

154
00:11:01,093 --> 00:11:04,028
We have to stop
meeting like this.

155
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:10,500
Hey, is everything okay?

156
00:11:10,569 --> 00:11:12,059
Yeah.

157
00:11:13,105 --> 00:11:15,505
Yeah.

158
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:17,064
Um...

159
00:11:19,111 --> 00:11:20,544
No, thanks.

160
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:22,877
Choir.

161
00:11:24,050 --> 00:11:25,540
I hope this
secondary smoke

162
00:11:25,618 --> 00:11:27,108
doesn't ruin your career.

163
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:32,954
How's your car?

164
00:11:33,025 --> 00:11:35,050
My car? My car is fine.

165
00:11:35,127 --> 00:11:38,062
School problems?

166
00:11:38,130 --> 00:11:39,688
School's easy...

167
00:11:39,765 --> 00:11:41,630
compared to my life.

168
00:11:52,144 --> 00:11:53,577
It's love that's hard.

169
00:11:53,646 --> 00:11:56,444
Love and relationships.

170
00:11:56,515 --> 00:11:58,312
I mean, why do
things change?

171
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:01,820
Why can't they stay like they were
in the beginning, you know?

172
00:12:01,887 --> 00:12:04,515
Romantic
and exciting and...

173
00:12:04,590 --> 00:12:06,524
you don't know
how many conversations

174
00:12:06,592 --> 00:12:08,025
Hayjay and I have had

175
00:12:08,094 --> 00:12:10,528
lasting until the wee
hours of the morning,

176
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:12,962
analyzing and psychotherapizing
every little thing.

177
00:12:13,032 --> 00:12:16,160
And the next day,
he's the same person all over again.

178
00:12:23,109 --> 00:12:25,543
Who's Hayjay?

179
00:12:25,611 --> 00:12:27,545
My boyfriend.

180
00:12:27,613 --> 00:12:29,342
Sort of.

181
00:12:29,415 --> 00:12:31,975
Well, you know,
they say that, uh...

182
00:12:32,051 --> 00:12:35,043
girls mature
faster than boys.

183
00:12:35,121 --> 00:12:38,648
Don't you think they would
even out by the age of 17?

184
00:12:39,825 --> 00:12:42,089
No, but then again,

185
00:12:42,161 --> 00:12:43,924
maybe you just
have to stick it out

186
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:45,486
through the rough times.

187
00:12:45,564 --> 00:12:47,555
I hate that.

188
00:12:47,633 --> 00:12:50,295
I think that people
should act out of love,

189
00:12:50,369 --> 00:12:52,234
not obligation.

190
00:12:54,840 --> 00:12:56,239
Don't you think?

191
00:12:56,308 --> 00:13:00,574
Yeah. I guess so.
Yeah.

192
00:13:00,646 --> 00:13:03,479
I'm at my wit's end.
I really am.

193
00:13:03,549 --> 00:13:05,744
I don't know
what to do anymore.

194
00:13:05,818 --> 00:13:09,015
Try going out
with a married woman.

195
00:13:09,088 --> 00:13:10,521
Excuse me?

196
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,022
Oh. Nothing.

197
00:13:12,091 --> 00:13:15,788
I just said everybody
needs love, that's all.

198
00:13:18,931 --> 00:13:20,728
You know what?
I'm really sorry.

199
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:22,028
I mean, I don't even know you,

200
00:13:22,101 --> 00:13:24,262
and I'm laying all
this crap on you.

201
00:13:26,071 --> 00:13:27,538
That's okay.

202
00:13:27,606 --> 00:13:30,541
I mean, I hope I didn't say

203
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:32,509
the wrong thing or anything.

204
00:13:32,578 --> 00:13:34,045
No.

205
00:13:34,113 --> 00:13:37,514
No. I'm sorry.
You've been really great.

206
00:13:37,583 --> 00:13:40,746
Thank you
for listening to me.

207
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,954
Can I still have
that cigarette?

208
00:13:46,025 --> 00:13:47,515
Yeah.

209
00:13:54,633 --> 00:13:56,066
Shit.

210
00:13:56,135 --> 00:13:58,126
Just take a drag off mine.

211
00:14:05,077 --> 00:14:09,070
Okay, you two.
Principal's office.

212
00:15:17,082 --> 00:15:18,481
I'm sorry.

213
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:20,017
I'm so...

214
00:15:21,553 --> 00:15:24,078
- I'm sorry I got you in trouble.
- Oh, please.

215
00:15:24,156 --> 00:15:27,182
I was the one that was bending
your ear about my stupid problems.

216
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,784
No, no. I mean, it's cool.

217
00:15:29,862 --> 00:15:32,854
We're like...
we're like, totally bonded now.

218
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,695
It's cool.

219
00:15:34,767 --> 00:15:37,065
Fucking dyke!

220
00:15:37,136 --> 00:15:38,535
Fucking asshole!

221
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,518
Do you want a ride home?

222
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:57,054
No. I got...

223
00:15:57,122 --> 00:15:59,181
I got my rollerblades.

224
00:16:00,626 --> 00:16:02,958
Okay.

225
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:04,996
Bye.

226
00:16:05,064 --> 00:16:06,497
You know what?

227
00:16:06,565 --> 00:16:07,998
Yeah?

228
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:10,501
They've been sticking
a little bit...

229
00:16:10,569 --> 00:16:13,003
the wheels.

230
00:16:13,072 --> 00:16:15,199
Okay. Come on.

231
00:16:28,187 --> 00:16:29,620
Is that your aunt?

232
00:16:29,688 --> 00:16:31,121
Oh, no, that's Lena.

233
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:34,523
That's my aunt's ex-girlfriend
from a thousand years ago

234
00:16:34,593 --> 00:16:35,924
who broke up with
her boyfriend,

235
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:38,964
and she's sleeping
on our couch for a while.

236
00:16:39,031 --> 00:16:41,056
She's kind of new age,
but she's cool.

237
00:16:44,570 --> 00:16:46,629
Well...

238
00:16:46,705 --> 00:16:48,730
thanks for the lift.

239
00:16:48,807 --> 00:16:51,537
Um...

240
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:55,546
did you mean that about...

241
00:16:55,614 --> 00:16:57,514
being with...

242
00:16:57,583 --> 00:16:59,676
a married woman?

243
00:17:06,025 --> 00:17:08,459
Um...

244
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:11,325
I thought
you didn't hear me.

245
00:17:11,397 --> 00:17:15,299
Just because I talk a lot
doesn't mean I don't listen.

246
00:17:17,536 --> 00:17:19,697
She's not
my real girlfriend or anything.

247
00:17:19,772 --> 00:17:23,003
It was just sort
of a fling kind of a deal.

248
00:17:26,578 --> 00:17:28,170
You're not weirded out,
are you?

249
00:17:28,247 --> 00:17:31,011
No. No. Not at all.

250
00:17:31,083 --> 00:17:32,414
I mean...

251
00:17:32,484 --> 00:17:33,712
why should I be?

252
00:17:33,786 --> 00:17:36,516
Well, most people are...

253
00:17:36,588 --> 00:17:39,148
at least most people
at our school.

254
00:17:39,224 --> 00:17:41,351
Well, I'm not most people.

255
00:17:44,096 --> 00:17:45,529
Okay.

256
00:17:45,597 --> 00:17:47,531
Whatever you say.

257
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,533
I'll see you at school.

258
00:17:49,601 --> 00:17:51,535
Yeah, definitely.

259
00:18:05,050 --> 00:18:06,483
Who's that?

260
00:18:06,552 --> 00:18:08,918
Some girl I met
in detention hall.

261
00:18:13,025 --> 00:18:14,925
Nice car.

262
00:18:19,064 --> 00:18:21,965
These tofu dogs
have artificial coloring in them.

263
00:18:22,034 --> 00:18:23,001
I can't believe it.

264
00:18:23,068 --> 00:18:25,502
Lena, could you help
set the table, please?

265
00:18:25,571 --> 00:18:27,004
Yeah, sure, Vick.

266
00:18:27,072 --> 00:18:28,937
I came out to a girl
at school today.

267
00:18:29,007 --> 00:18:31,066
How'd it go?

268
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,168
Well, she didn't run
for the hills or anything.

269
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:34,803
That's great, hon.

270
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:37,610
She's, like, this totally cute
popular girl in my school.

271
00:18:37,683 --> 00:18:38,911
Well, be careful.

272
00:18:38,984 --> 00:18:40,713
You never know
how people are going to be.

273
00:18:40,786 --> 00:18:43,448
But it's good you came out.
Really, I'm proud of you.

274
00:18:43,522 --> 00:18:47,083
Why do you have to make everything
out into a federal discrimination case?

275
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:48,626
Hey, look, there's a TV
show on tonight

276
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:50,423
about two girls
who go to the prom together.

277
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:52,157
- How about that?
- Wow, that's great.

278
00:18:52,231 --> 00:18:54,529
- "Based on a true story."
- Damn. We don't get cable.

279
00:18:54,600 --> 00:18:55,999
We can't afford it, Lena.

280
00:18:56,068 --> 00:18:57,535
Yeah. It's kind of expensive.

281
00:18:57,603 --> 00:18:59,036
Vicky's cooking, Randy.

282
00:18:59,104 --> 00:19:01,038
I think proms are stupid.

283
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:02,971
God, I would've given anything
to go to the prom

284
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:04,770
if I'd had a girlfriend
in high school.

285
00:19:04,843 --> 00:19:06,071
I went to the prom
with a girl.

286
00:19:06,145 --> 00:19:09,080
- Your sister doesn't count.
- She's a good dancer.

287
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:12,242
Don't tell me you wouldn't want to go
to the prom with your girlfriend, Randy.

288
00:19:12,317 --> 00:19:13,978
First off, I don't have a girlfriend.

289
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:16,452
Second off,
I think proms are stupid.

290
00:19:16,522 --> 00:19:18,990
Third off,
if I went to the prom,

291
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:20,524
I would go with Frank.

292
00:19:20,592 --> 00:19:22,321
Frank's a good dancer.

293
00:19:22,394 --> 00:19:25,158
# We're so cool,
yeah, yeah #

294
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:28,063
# Yeah, we're so cool, cool #

295
00:19:28,133 --> 00:19:30,693
# We're so cool,
yeah, yeah #

296
00:19:30,769 --> 00:19:32,202
# Fuck you, too #

297
00:19:32,271 --> 00:19:33,932
# Cool schmool #

298
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:39,536
# I don't want to sit around #

299
00:19:39,611 --> 00:19:41,340
# And talk about
the why, girls #

300
00:19:41,413 --> 00:19:43,881
# Worked out good all day #

301
00:19:43,949 --> 00:19:46,440
# I don't want to wonder
if you're going to say hello #

302
00:19:46,518 --> 00:19:49,180
# I don't want to wonder
if you're going to walk away. #

303
00:19:53,592 --> 00:19:55,958
I'm teaching myself
how to read music, Regina.

304
00:19:56,028 --> 00:19:58,019
Sounds like it.

305
00:19:58,096 --> 00:20:00,030
Thanks a lot.

306
00:20:08,574 --> 00:20:12,169
Well, if it isn't Anita Ekberg.

307
00:20:16,615 --> 00:20:18,776
Could I speak to you
for a minute, babe?

308
00:20:18,850 --> 00:20:21,978
No. I only have a few minutes.

309
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:39,367
God! That girl gets me crazy!

310
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:43,232
There. That's better.

311
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:47,942
What you got on
underneath that raincoat?

312
00:20:48,013 --> 00:20:50,573
Oh! Why must you
torture me so?

313
00:20:54,152 --> 00:20:55,346
What's up, Wendy?

314
00:20:58,624 --> 00:21:00,387
Ali's getting
on my case again

315
00:21:00,459 --> 00:21:03,951
about filling up
that dang car all the time.

316
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:06,896
We just ought
to cool it for a while,

317
00:21:06,965 --> 00:21:08,865
like maybe a week or so.

318
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:12,434
Last time you said that,

319
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:14,495
I didn't see you
for, like, two months.

320
00:21:14,573 --> 00:21:17,542
Look, it's a hard situation.

321
00:21:18,610 --> 00:21:21,636
We're both
at different stages in life.

322
00:21:21,713 --> 00:21:23,613
I mean,
I'm 27 years old,

323
00:21:23,682 --> 00:21:25,206
and you're, like, 17.

324
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:26,478
I'm a married woman,

325
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:28,416
and you're just
a young little thing

326
00:21:28,487 --> 00:21:30,114
flitting around,
having a good time.

327
00:21:32,624 --> 00:21:34,057
You know what, Wendy?

328
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:37,755
That's just fine.
That's just fine with me.

329
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:39,319
You know why?

330
00:21:39,398 --> 00:21:41,263
Because I met someone else.

331
00:21:41,333 --> 00:21:44,302
I met someone my own age,
and we're going out now.

332
00:21:44,369 --> 00:21:47,065
Well, I'll be damned.

333
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:50,302
You are one sly
little chicken, aren't you?

334
00:21:55,580 --> 00:21:57,070
Well...

335
00:21:57,149 --> 00:21:58,946
I suppose I could
get Ali off my case.

336
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:03,246
Maybe I could come by later.

337
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:06,018
- Maybe.
- It's too late. I'm booked.

338
00:22:06,091 --> 00:22:07,490
I'm starting a band.

339
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:09,026
I've got band practice later.

340
00:22:09,094 --> 00:22:11,995
Ha! I don't believe this.

341
00:22:13,365 --> 00:22:15,424
Look, you just have fun
going to the movies

342
00:22:15,500 --> 00:22:17,661
and holding hands
with that new girlfriend of yours,

343
00:22:17,736 --> 00:22:20,466
and sipping through straws together
and making googly eyes!

344
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:22,302
Where you going, Wendy?

345
00:22:25,077 --> 00:22:26,738
I have things to do, okay?

346
00:22:26,812 --> 00:22:28,404
Thank you very much.

347
00:22:28,480 --> 00:22:30,846
Going to the mall?

348
00:22:31,950 --> 00:22:34,145
It's none of your business
where I'm going.

349
00:22:34,219 --> 00:22:36,710
What, you mad? You mad?

350
00:22:36,788 --> 00:22:38,619
You mad that I won't do
everything you say?

351
00:22:38,690 --> 00:22:41,056
Oh, you go ahead and you do
anything you want!

352
00:22:41,126 --> 00:22:43,560
It's fine with me!
Just fine!

353
00:22:43,628 --> 00:22:45,323
I'll check in in a few.

354
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:48,059
What, a few years?

355
00:22:48,133 --> 00:22:49,532
You're driving me nuts!

356
00:22:49,601 --> 00:22:51,034
You drive me nuts!

357
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:08,279
Hey.

358
00:23:12,090 --> 00:23:14,524
Heard you're hanging out

359
00:23:14,593 --> 00:23:16,493
with Randy Dean.

360
00:23:16,561 --> 00:23:19,029
What,
are you guys the KGB?

361
00:23:19,097 --> 00:23:21,031
There is
no KGB any more, Evie.

362
00:23:21,099 --> 00:23:22,464
All right. Whatever.

363
00:23:22,534 --> 00:23:24,525
We're just saying.

364
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:27,538
- So?
- So what?

365
00:23:27,606 --> 00:23:29,801
Were you hanging
out with her or what?

366
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:32,742
So what if I was?

367
00:23:32,811 --> 00:23:35,837
She's pretty much
of a freak, I think.

368
00:23:35,914 --> 00:23:37,347
In more ways than one.

369
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:39,281
What's that
supposed to mean?

370
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:41,376
Well, she's a total
pothead, number one,

371
00:23:41,453 --> 00:23:44,115
and she's like a total diesel dyke,
number two.

372
00:23:45,824 --> 00:23:47,883
So what?

373
00:23:47,959 --> 00:23:49,483
Nothing.
We're just saying.

374
00:23:49,561 --> 00:23:51,552
I mean, I just don't get
why she has to flaunt it.

375
00:23:51,630 --> 00:23:53,063
I mean, she could fix herself up

376
00:23:53,131 --> 00:23:56,362
and not try to act like a man.
Maybe?

377
00:23:56,435 --> 00:23:58,460
You know, you guys
are so small.

378
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:01,665
Oh, Evie's got a thing
for the freak of the class!

379
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:03,435
I do not. Get out.

380
00:24:03,508 --> 00:24:05,840
Aren't you getting
a little defensive, Evie?

381
00:24:05,911 --> 00:24:07,674
I am not
getting defensive.

382
00:24:07,746 --> 00:24:09,680
Well, I don't think she seems
like your type anyway, Evie.

383
00:24:09,748 --> 00:24:12,046
I mean, I don't think she even
knows how to read.

384
00:24:14,319 --> 00:24:16,787
I don't even know
why I hang out with you guys.

385
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:21,315
Because we love you, Evie!
We love you!

386
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,492
Hey, Evie.
How's it going?

387
00:24:57,562 --> 00:25:00,929
Still got love problems?

388
00:25:00,999 --> 00:25:03,797
Hey, I'm sorry
about detention hall.

389
00:25:03,869 --> 00:25:06,838
You know,
I hate math... and English...

390
00:25:06,905 --> 00:25:08,805
and history.

391
00:25:08,874 --> 00:25:12,071
The whole damn thing
can go to hell, wouldn't you say?

392
00:25:12,143 --> 00:25:16,443
Well, take care,
and I'll see you around.

393
00:25:16,515 --> 00:25:19,382
Hey, my locker is 718.

394
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:22,784
Come by and visit sometime
at the old gas station.

395
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:07,854
PS: What bands
do you like?

396
00:26:07,933 --> 00:26:11,892
PPS:
The things I do like

397
00:26:11,970 --> 00:26:13,938
are trees in the summer

398
00:26:14,005 --> 00:26:16,439
and lying on green grass.

399
00:26:16,508 --> 00:26:18,442
It smells so good,

400
00:26:18,510 --> 00:26:19,841
don't you think?

401
00:26:21,580 --> 00:26:23,741
Are we broken up,
or not?

402
00:26:23,815 --> 00:26:28,718
Hayjay, why you always
sneaking up on me, man?

403
00:26:34,059 --> 00:26:35,993
Just tell me the truth.

404
00:26:36,061 --> 00:26:37,995
I want to know the truth.

405
00:26:38,063 --> 00:26:39,587
I can take it.

406
00:26:41,600 --> 00:26:43,465
I don't know.

407
00:26:43,535 --> 00:26:45,503
I mean...

408
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:48,505
I just think that we need
a trial separation.

409
00:26:48,573 --> 00:26:51,508
I mean, I need
a trial separation.

410
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:54,136
I mean, I love you.

411
00:26:54,212 --> 00:26:56,271
I just think that...

412
00:26:56,348 --> 00:26:59,146
why do you always
make everything an intellectual thing?

413
00:26:59,217 --> 00:27:01,651
You can never see things
from an emotional point of view.

414
00:27:02,687 --> 00:27:05,588
- That is not true.
- Oh, yes, it is.

415
00:27:06,758 --> 00:27:08,487
All right.

416
00:27:08,560 --> 00:27:10,494
You want to break up,

417
00:27:10,562 --> 00:27:12,996
just don't call me, okay?

418
00:27:13,064 --> 00:27:14,964
Okay?

419
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:19,732
- A break is a break.
- All right.

420
00:27:19,804 --> 00:27:22,329
What did you say?

421
00:27:22,407 --> 00:27:24,170
I won't call you.
I promise.

422
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:34,577
I know those were
love notes, Evie.

423
00:27:54,339 --> 00:27:56,307
I spoke
to your father today.

424
00:27:56,374 --> 00:27:58,103
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

425
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:01,076
Honey, your father
said that the bank

426
00:28:01,146 --> 00:28:03,341
might transfer him
to the office in London.

427
00:28:03,415 --> 00:28:04,814
Really?

428
00:28:04,883 --> 00:28:08,478
Won't that be a wonderful
opportunity for you?

429
00:28:08,553 --> 00:28:09,986
Uh-huh.

430
00:28:10,055 --> 00:28:12,489
You'd get to visit him, Evie.

431
00:28:12,557 --> 00:28:15,048
I'm just gonna need
a 1/2 cup of balsamic.

432
00:28:17,128 --> 00:28:18,993
I think
it's 1/4 cup, dear.

433
00:28:22,934 --> 00:28:25,994
Evie, when are you going
to stop being so agitated

434
00:28:26,071 --> 00:28:27,766
every time I mention
your father?

435
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:31,104
Honey, we have our own life.
He has his.

436
00:28:31,176 --> 00:28:33,610
Everything is fine
with everyone.

437
00:28:36,881 --> 00:28:39,372
And a teaspoon of olive oil
and we'll be done.

438
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:41,510
You know, sweetheart...

439
00:28:41,586 --> 00:28:44,521
let me point it out to you...

440
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:48,525
that we've made it
this far without any major calamities.

441
00:28:48,593 --> 00:28:50,026
That's good.

442
00:28:51,162 --> 00:28:54,097
I really think you can relax
about the whole thing.

443
00:28:54,165 --> 00:28:56,395
- Watch out.
- Oh! Shit!

444
00:28:56,468 --> 00:28:58,493
It's okay. It's really
no big deal.

445
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:00,697
Evie, it's fine.
Just relax.

446
00:29:00,772 --> 00:29:02,205
I will take care of everything.

447
00:29:02,273 --> 00:29:04,673
- It's ruined. I ruined it.
- It's not ruined, Evie.

448
00:29:04,743 --> 00:29:07,405
Just relax, and I'll
take care of everything.

449
00:29:07,479 --> 00:29:10,277
My poor baby has
the senior-year jitters.

450
00:29:10,348 --> 00:29:11,440
I ruined everything.

451
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:14,508
You didn't ruin
anything, Evie.

452
00:29:14,586 --> 00:29:16,986
Evie, look at me.
It's not ruined.

453
00:29:17,055 --> 00:29:19,990
Sweetheart, you never
ruin anything.

454
00:29:20,058 --> 00:29:22,925
You're Mamma's
perfect little girl.

455
00:29:22,994 --> 00:29:24,962
Phosphoric acid!
Gross!

456
00:29:25,029 --> 00:29:26,792
Lena, could you help
set the table, please?

457
00:29:26,865 --> 00:29:30,596
Some asshole at work
called me "sir" again today.

458
00:29:30,668 --> 00:29:33,660
When I have that tattoo,
that'll fuck him up.

459
00:29:33,738 --> 00:29:35,968
Graduate and you're
getting a tattoo, Randy.

460
00:29:36,040 --> 00:29:37,507
I'm going to graduate.

461
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:38,974
I got called
sweetheart all day.

462
00:29:39,043 --> 00:29:40,874
Even though you don't
have a job, Lena?

463
00:29:40,945 --> 00:29:42,503
Honey, that smells great.

464
00:29:44,082 --> 00:29:46,516
Then you get to do
the things you want.

465
00:29:46,584 --> 00:29:49,519
You won't have
to put up with shit jobs.

466
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:53,023
I went to college,
and I had shit jobs.

467
00:29:53,091 --> 00:29:55,889
Everybody in a band
has a tattoo nowadays.

468
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:58,485
- All right, all right.
- This stuff is bad for you.

469
00:29:58,563 --> 00:29:59,928
Everybody stop picking.

470
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:03,263
Let's sit down and eat
like the normal family that we are.

471
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:06,235
Get the pasta.
Bring the bread.

472
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:40,536
Pray tell, I only got to see
his cute, round butt.

473
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:42,937
You are always
talking about butts.

474
00:30:44,175 --> 00:30:46,837
Dear Randy,
I got your note.

475
00:30:48,012 --> 00:30:50,480
Um, I'm sorry
I didn't say anything

476
00:30:50,548 --> 00:30:53,483
after school
when I saw you, but...

477
00:30:55,587 --> 00:30:58,249
She'll think I'm such a jerk.

478
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:03,890
What am I going to say?

479
00:31:03,962 --> 00:31:07,329
Hi, Randy.
Thanks for your note.

480
00:31:09,901 --> 00:31:11,698
I can't believe this.

481
00:31:11,769 --> 00:31:15,000
I left that note
in her locker, like, a year ago.

482
00:31:15,073 --> 00:31:17,507
I'm such a fucking fool!

483
00:31:17,575 --> 00:31:19,566
Well, maybe she never got it.

484
00:31:19,644 --> 00:31:21,009
Shit!

485
00:31:21,079 --> 00:31:23,809
You're right. What if she never got it?
What if somebody else got it?

486
00:31:23,882 --> 00:31:26,043
What if someone else took
the note out of her locker?

487
00:31:26,117 --> 00:31:27,880
I'm sure that nothing
like that happened.

488
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:30,352
Just stop thinking
about it so much.

489
00:31:39,631 --> 00:31:41,826
See?

490
00:31:45,103 --> 00:31:48,072
- Hey.
- Hey.

491
00:31:48,139 --> 00:31:51,040
Listen, um... there's
something wrong with my car.

492
00:31:51,109 --> 00:31:52,576
It's, like, freaking out.

493
00:31:52,644 --> 00:31:54,077
It's knocking and rocking and...

494
00:31:54,145 --> 00:31:56,079
maybe you know something
about engine repair.

495
00:31:56,147 --> 00:31:57,944
Yeah, I know a lot.
What about it?

496
00:31:58,016 --> 00:32:01,076
Our mechanic Ali is
only here once every two weeks.

497
00:32:01,152 --> 00:32:02,585
- Oh.
- I can handle this.

498
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,417
Fine, don't listen to me.

499
00:32:04,489 --> 00:32:08,016
Let a high-school student
take a look at your $50,000 engine.

500
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,492
Isn't the phone
ringing, Regina?

501
00:32:23,107 --> 00:32:26,042
I got your note.

502
00:32:26,110 --> 00:32:27,543
Like, when?

503
00:32:27,612 --> 00:32:30,046
A couple of days ago.

504
00:32:30,114 --> 00:32:32,548
Oh. So your car's
freaking out.

505
00:32:32,617 --> 00:32:35,051
That's why you're here?

506
00:32:35,119 --> 00:32:37,610
No. Um, I brought
you something.

507
00:32:40,491 --> 00:32:43,483
It's called
"Leaves of Grass."

508
00:32:43,561 --> 00:32:47,053
It's by Walt Whitman.

509
00:32:47,131 --> 00:32:49,065
Wow, this is a...

510
00:32:49,133 --> 00:32:50,964
it's, like, a poetry book.

511
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:53,526
Yeah. It's not
just about grass.

512
00:32:53,604 --> 00:32:56,573
It's my grandmother's.

513
00:32:56,641 --> 00:32:58,541
Wow. Um...

514
00:32:58,609 --> 00:33:00,577
I like poems,
I mean...

515
00:33:00,645 --> 00:33:02,579
do you like Billie Holiday?

516
00:33:02,647 --> 00:33:05,514
I think she's kind of a poet.

517
00:33:05,583 --> 00:33:07,517
Yeah, me too, sort of.

518
00:33:07,585 --> 00:33:09,348
Your name's in here.

519
00:33:12,590 --> 00:33:13,579
Thanks.

520
00:33:13,658 --> 00:33:15,489
You're welcome.

521
00:33:15,560 --> 00:33:17,027
Thanks a lot.

522
00:33:17,095 --> 00:33:18,528
I better get going.

523
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:20,029
Oh. Okay.

524
00:33:20,098 --> 00:33:22,157
Whatever.

525
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:30,540
So you like the book?

526
00:33:30,608 --> 00:33:32,041
Yeah, yeah.

527
00:33:32,110 --> 00:33:34,044
Definitely.

528
00:33:36,614 --> 00:33:38,514
Well...

529
00:33:38,583 --> 00:33:41,051
Well, what bands
do you like?

530
00:33:41,119 --> 00:33:44,054
Oh, you know,
just old stuff.

531
00:33:44,122 --> 00:33:47,558
Classics... Janis Joplin,
Jimi Hendrix,

532
00:33:47,625 --> 00:33:50,890
Led Zeppelin,
Stones...

533
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:52,953
early Stones,
not later Stones.

534
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:55,522
Right. Right.

535
00:33:55,600 --> 00:33:58,569
My friends are always
teasing me about my music...

536
00:33:58,636 --> 00:34:00,297
opera and classical.

537
00:34:00,371 --> 00:34:03,067
I just try
to get them to feel it,

538
00:34:03,141 --> 00:34:04,506
you know what I mean?

539
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:06,008
Yeah.

540
00:34:06,077 --> 00:34:08,238
To feel how beautiful
the music is,

541
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:11,008
you know, and how it can
totally take you over...

542
00:34:11,082 --> 00:34:13,312
your entire
sense of being.

543
00:34:13,384 --> 00:34:16,512
Yeah, I know.
I think music's great.

544
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:19,522
I think it's the reason to live.

545
00:34:19,590 --> 00:34:20,989
I'm starting a band.

546
00:34:21,059 --> 00:34:22,526
Really?

547
00:34:22,593 --> 00:34:23,924
Yeah, rock 'n' roll band.

548
00:34:23,995 --> 00:34:26,987
Wow. You get
to travel and stuff.

549
00:34:27,065 --> 00:34:28,862
It'd be great.

550
00:34:31,102 --> 00:34:32,535
Thanks for the book.

551
00:34:32,603 --> 00:34:34,503
Oh, you're welcome.

552
00:34:34,572 --> 00:34:37,541
I'll read it tonight.

553
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:39,041
All right.

554
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,543
I got to go.

555
00:34:40,611 --> 00:34:42,044
Okay.

556
00:34:42,113 --> 00:34:43,546
Bye.

557
00:34:43,614 --> 00:34:45,047
See ya.

558
00:34:45,116 --> 00:34:47,050
Bye.

559
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:49,552
"The smoke of my own breath,

560
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:53,556
echoes, ripples,
and buzz'd whispers,

561
00:34:53,624 --> 00:34:55,956
love-root, silk-thread,

562
00:34:57,028 --> 00:34:59,690
crotch and vine..."

563
00:35:00,731 --> 00:35:02,426
Crotch.

564
00:35:02,500 --> 00:35:05,492
"My respiration and inspiration,

565
00:35:05,570 --> 00:35:07,504
the beating of my heart,

566
00:35:07,572 --> 00:35:11,474
the passing of air
and blood through my lungs...

567
00:35:11,542 --> 00:35:14,010
a few embraces,

568
00:35:14,078 --> 00:35:17,013
a reaching around of arms...

569
00:35:17,081 --> 00:35:19,447
the feeling of health...

570
00:35:22,086 --> 00:35:24,987
the song of me rising from bed

571
00:35:25,056 --> 00:35:27,490
and meeting the sun."

572
00:35:29,594 --> 00:35:32,085
God! This is intense!

573
00:35:38,970 --> 00:35:41,063
Regina, have you ever heard of

574
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,266
that book called
"Leaves of Grass"?

575
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,536
Of course. It's famous.

576
00:35:45,610 --> 00:35:47,407
I had to read it in college.

577
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:51,039
Walt Whitman.
He was a homo.

578
00:35:51,115 --> 00:35:53,515
That girl gave it to me,

579
00:35:53,584 --> 00:35:55,279
and I've been reading it.

580
00:35:55,353 --> 00:35:56,650
It's heavy.

581
00:35:56,721 --> 00:36:00,555
What's the deal
with her anyway?

582
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,560
I don't know.

583
00:36:03,628 --> 00:36:07,530
She's not really what she seems
to be on the outside.

584
00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:12,968
I'm in love with her.

585
00:36:13,037 --> 00:36:15,471
That's what you said
about Wendy.

586
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:17,474
Anyway,
you just met her.

587
00:36:17,542 --> 00:36:20,170
Wendy was just infatuation.

588
00:36:20,244 --> 00:36:22,906
Total infatuation.

589
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:30,919
Shit! She lives in a mansion.

590
00:36:30,988 --> 00:36:32,512
She's probably spoiled, then.

591
00:36:32,590 --> 00:36:34,114
I don't think she's spoiled.

592
00:36:34,192 --> 00:36:36,786
Okay. Sheltered and privileged.
How's that?

593
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:38,988
I don't think
Evie's like that, Frank.

594
00:36:39,063 --> 00:36:42,032
All right, fine.
So Evie's special.

595
00:36:42,099 --> 00:36:43,259
Can we go now?

596
00:36:53,444 --> 00:36:55,844
# Dear dearest one #

597
00:36:55,913 --> 00:36:58,313
# This is what I've done #

598
00:36:58,382 --> 00:37:00,748
# This is what I said #

599
00:37:00,818 --> 00:37:02,945
# Like a fling of my hair #

600
00:37:03,020 --> 00:37:06,922
# Why do I stare at you? #

601
00:37:08,559 --> 00:37:10,959
"A gigantic beauty of a stallion,

602
00:37:11,028 --> 00:37:13,997
fresh and responsive
to my caresses,

603
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:18,161
head high in the forehead
and wide between the ears,

604
00:37:18,236 --> 00:37:20,170
limbs glossy and supple,

605
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:22,433
tail dusting the ground,

606
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:26,909
eyes well apart and full
of sparkling wickedness."

607
00:37:26,978 --> 00:37:29,970
Jeez. What a homo
that guy was.

608
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,607
He was writing
about the power of nature, Regina.

609
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:35,015
Yeah, aren't we all.

610
00:37:35,086 --> 00:37:37,020
Don't you have
homework to do?

611
00:37:37,088 --> 00:37:38,953
I don't do math

612
00:37:39,023 --> 00:37:41,014
when I can read this book.

613
00:37:42,593 --> 00:37:45,494
Hey! Want to go for a drive?

614
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,760
I have to work.

615
00:37:49,834 --> 00:37:51,563
Ohh...

616
00:37:58,109 --> 00:38:01,272
Go discover the power of nature,
why don't you?

617
00:38:05,516 --> 00:38:07,609
What are they saying?

618
00:38:07,685 --> 00:38:11,485
I have no idea.

619
00:38:11,555 --> 00:38:14,023
Something in Latin.

620
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:19,490
Isn't it beautiful?

621
00:38:19,563 --> 00:38:21,997
How do you know it's beautiful

622
00:38:22,066 --> 00:38:24,000
if you can't understand it?

623
00:38:24,068 --> 00:38:25,695
You just know.

624
00:38:27,571 --> 00:38:29,903
It's not about God, is it?

625
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,000
Because I'm not into God.

626
00:38:33,077 --> 00:38:35,011
That's all right.

627
00:38:39,083 --> 00:38:41,779
You can just feel it, Randy.

628
00:38:54,031 --> 00:38:54,332
Do you ever hear
from your mom?

629
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,527
Do you ever hear
from your mom?

630
00:38:56,600 --> 00:38:57,999
Yeah,
on my birthday.

631
00:39:16,554 --> 00:39:19,455
Gross! What's
that supposed to mean?

632
00:39:19,523 --> 00:39:22,822
Operation rescue.
It's her whole life.

633
00:39:22,893 --> 00:39:25,157
"May the Lord watch
over you on your birthday.

634
00:39:25,229 --> 00:39:27,060
Glory to God. Love, Mom."

635
00:39:30,067 --> 00:39:33,468
She even went to jail for it.

636
00:39:33,537 --> 00:39:36,973
She thinks we're all sinners.

637
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,702
But you're her daughter.

638
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,539
Yeah, everything
worked out okay.

639
00:39:44,615 --> 00:39:45,877
I have a family
and everything.

640
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:48,475
Yeah.

641
00:39:48,552 --> 00:39:52,010
You know, it's weird when you tell
the story of your life,

642
00:39:52,089 --> 00:39:54,421
but when you're in it,

643
00:39:54,492 --> 00:39:57,359
it just seems
just as normal as anything else,

644
00:39:57,428 --> 00:39:58,520
you know what I mean?

645
00:39:58,596 --> 00:40:00,029
It's like when you hear about

646
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:01,530
those so-called normal families,

647
00:40:01,599 --> 00:40:03,533
and then you find out
that they're into incest

648
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:07,037
and Satanic ritual abuse
and gross stuff like that.

649
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:10,198
Totally.

650
00:40:10,274 --> 00:40:11,798
What about you?

651
00:40:13,277 --> 00:40:16,041
Well, um, my parents
split up when I was four,

652
00:40:16,113 --> 00:40:18,047
and...

653
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:21,050
my dad, he remarried
a white woman,

654
00:40:21,118 --> 00:40:24,713
which... it kind
of pissed my mom off.

655
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:29,053
Um... but we get along
fine, though.

656
00:40:29,126 --> 00:40:31,890
I mean, he's always
overcompensating.

657
00:40:31,962 --> 00:40:33,554
That's how I got the car.

658
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:35,565
But, you know, it's fine.

659
00:40:35,633 --> 00:40:37,965
It's... it's cool.

660
00:40:48,646 --> 00:40:50,614
I don't want
to shock you or anything,

661
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:53,582
But, uh...

662
00:40:53,651 --> 00:40:56,518
I really want to hold
your hand right now.

663
00:40:58,656 --> 00:41:01,250
I mean, I wanted to
hold your hand all day.

664
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:06,027
I've held hands
with a girl before.

665
00:41:06,096 --> 00:41:08,030
Girls like me?

666
00:41:08,098 --> 00:41:10,032
No, I guess not.

667
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:13,035
I mean, but...
what could happen?

668
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:17,039
We'd get the shit
beat out of us, that's all.

669
00:41:17,107 --> 00:41:19,507
Just for holding hands?

670
00:41:19,577 --> 00:41:22,546
I don't believe that.

671
00:41:22,613 --> 00:41:25,946
God, Evie,
you are so sheltered.

672
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:32,020
Well...

673
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:33,954
unshelter me.

674
00:41:48,105 --> 00:41:50,630
You gals
want anything else?

675
00:41:50,708 --> 00:41:55,008
Uh, yeah. I'll have,
uh, another cup of coffee.

676
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:57,047
I'll have a beer.

677
00:41:57,114 --> 00:41:58,741
What kind do you want?

678
00:41:58,816 --> 00:42:01,148
Uh, I'll have a Mick.

679
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:02,651
A what?

680
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:04,915
A Mick.
You know, Michelob.

681
00:42:04,989 --> 00:42:07,355
You got ID?

682
00:42:07,424 --> 00:42:10,291
Um...

683
00:42:10,361 --> 00:42:12,090
Ah. Shit.

684
00:42:12,162 --> 00:42:14,027
You know, I must have
left it at work.

685
00:42:14,098 --> 00:42:17,033
No ID, no Mick.

686
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:20,036
All right,
I'll have a cup of joe.

687
00:42:20,104 --> 00:42:21,537
A what?

688
00:42:21,605 --> 00:42:23,038
A cup of joe.

689
00:42:23,107 --> 00:42:24,972
Just kidding.
Two coffees coming up.

690
00:42:25,042 --> 00:42:26,634
God.

691
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,304
Everyone's got to be a joker!

692
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:44,255
I can't. Now I feel weird
about that waitress.

693
00:43:09,219 --> 00:43:10,777
Hey.

694
00:43:30,341 --> 00:43:32,468
Hey, Evie.
How's it going?

695
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:36,070
Listen, want to come over
to my place and have dinner?

696
00:43:36,146 --> 00:43:38,979
Hey, Evie, check it out. Dinner
at my place, Thursday night, 6:00 p.m.

697
00:43:39,049 --> 00:43:42,485
Evie, check it out. Dinner at my house, next
week, Thursday night, 6:00 p.m.

698
00:43:44,688 --> 00:43:48,021
Hey, Evie, want to meet my weird family
and eat organic pasta at my house?

699
00:43:48,092 --> 00:43:53,052
You do? Great!
Great. Great. Great.

700
00:43:54,098 --> 00:43:56,066
No, wait.
What if she says no way?

701
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:58,567
She's, like,
no fucking way, you freak.

702
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:00,433
She wouldn't say that.

703
00:44:00,504 --> 00:44:03,473
She wanted to hold hands
with me in the diner.

704
00:44:03,540 --> 00:44:04,973
Yeah, okay.

705
00:44:05,042 --> 00:44:07,510
Okay, I'm just going to be myself.

706
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:09,478
I'm going to act cool.

707
00:44:09,546 --> 00:44:10,945
I'm just gonna say...

708
00:44:11,015 --> 00:44:14,007
what are you doing
Thursday night, Evie?

709
00:44:14,084 --> 00:44:17,520
Want to come over
to my house...

710
00:44:17,588 --> 00:44:20,955
have dinner...
meet my family?

711
00:44:21,025 --> 00:44:23,960
It's great that you love pasta, Evie,
because we eat it here a lot.

712
00:44:24,028 --> 00:44:27,088
I love pasta. Pasta's great.
Can I help with something?

713
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:30,031
Oh no, you relax.
You're our guest.

714
00:44:30,100 --> 00:44:32,000
Randy, put that down.
Vicky's cooking.

715
00:44:32,069 --> 00:44:34,503
Randy, stop snacking.
She's always snacking.

716
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:36,539
So, what does
your mom do, Evie?

717
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:39,974
She's a consultant, um,
for developing nations.

718
00:44:40,044 --> 00:44:41,511
This is gonna be delicious.

719
00:44:41,578 --> 00:44:44,046
Her actual title is
agricultural economist.

720
00:44:44,114 --> 00:44:48,073
Oh, wow.
Farms and stuff, huh?

721
00:44:48,152 --> 00:44:50,916
Yeah. Let me
help you with something.

722
00:44:50,988 --> 00:44:52,546
Oh no, that's okay.
Lena, do you mind?

723
00:44:52,623 --> 00:44:54,557
Oh, yeah. Sure, Vick.

724
00:44:54,625 --> 00:44:56,559
Vicky is a great cook.

725
00:44:56,627 --> 00:44:59,061
Except, you know,
you got to watch out...

726
00:44:59,129 --> 00:45:01,290
Vicky, where are the napkins?

727
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:04,994
Evie, that's really interesting
what your mom does.

728
00:45:05,069 --> 00:45:09,472
Yeah, um, the best part
is that we get to travel.

729
00:45:09,540 --> 00:45:13,101
Like, last year, she had to go
to Paris for her annual meetings,

730
00:45:13,177 --> 00:45:15,611
and I got to go with her
for a whole week.

731
00:45:15,679 --> 00:45:18,079
Wow! All right!

732
00:45:18,148 --> 00:45:21,117
- I'm training as a boxer.
- Really?

733
00:45:21,185 --> 00:45:23,483
Yeah. I doubt
there's much work

734
00:45:23,554 --> 00:45:25,419
for female boxers
nowadays.

735
00:45:25,489 --> 00:45:28,049
Yeah. I can believe that.

736
00:45:28,125 --> 00:45:30,719
Okay, everyone,
let's go sit down.

737
00:45:30,794 --> 00:45:33,024
Um, okay.

738
00:45:35,132 --> 00:45:37,032
Rebecca, are you
gonna get the bread?

739
00:45:37,101 --> 00:45:38,568
Thank you so much.

740
00:45:38,635 --> 00:45:40,865
It's great to have you.

741
00:45:40,938 --> 00:45:43,168
I'm so hungry.

742
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,367
I am, too.

743
00:45:45,442 --> 00:45:47,342
Okay.

744
00:45:47,411 --> 00:45:49,038
We never really sit
at the table,

745
00:45:49,113 --> 00:45:51,172
so this is a very
special occasion.

746
00:45:51,248 --> 00:45:53,341
We do too sit at the table.

747
00:45:55,886 --> 00:45:57,911
We made it through
another day.

748
00:45:57,988 --> 00:46:00,047
- Thank the goddess.
- Hear, hear!

749
00:46:00,124 --> 00:46:02,115
Thanks for coming
to dinner.

750
00:46:03,527 --> 00:46:05,188
Hey, now,
help yourselves, everyone.

751
00:46:05,262 --> 00:46:06,991
Would you like some vegetables?

752
00:46:07,064 --> 00:46:09,225
I'd love some vegetables.

753
00:46:09,299 --> 00:46:11,893
Well, that went pretty well.

754
00:46:11,969 --> 00:46:14,767
I should have invited
Frank, though.

755
00:46:14,838 --> 00:46:18,103
He really would have
wanted to come.

756
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:21,269
Your aunt hates me.

757
00:46:21,345 --> 00:46:24,781
I mean,
why does she hate me?

758
00:46:24,848 --> 00:46:27,316
No, she doesn't.

759
00:46:27,384 --> 00:46:29,750
Shit, no.

760
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:32,789
She's just really hard to get
to know, that's all.

761
00:46:32,856 --> 00:46:36,223
I bet when I go back in there,
she'll talk about how great you were.

762
00:46:36,293 --> 00:46:38,284
Really?

763
00:46:38,362 --> 00:46:40,330
Definitely.

764
00:46:41,698 --> 00:46:43,825
I mean...

765
00:46:43,901 --> 00:46:46,802
it isn't because I'm black
or anything, is it?

766
00:46:47,971 --> 00:46:50,769
No.

767
00:46:50,841 --> 00:46:52,775
No way.

768
00:46:54,077 --> 00:46:57,478
She just probably
has a problem

769
00:46:57,548 --> 00:46:59,243
with people who can go
to Paris for a week.

770
00:46:59,316 --> 00:47:00,476
Mm-hmm.

771
00:47:00,551 --> 00:47:01,882
That's all.

772
00:47:04,021 --> 00:47:05,579
She likes you.

773
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:10,752
She... likes you a lot.

774
00:47:13,030 --> 00:47:15,362
I mean...

775
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:17,764
at least
you can be yourself with them.

776
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,361
I mean, that's cool.

777
00:47:26,109 --> 00:47:27,838
Do you want
some chewing gum?

778
00:47:27,911 --> 00:47:29,674
Okay.

779
00:48:53,697 --> 00:48:58,532
Tonight I kissed another woman
for the first time in my life.

780
00:49:00,537 --> 00:49:02,402
The question now is,

781
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:05,407
what will I do?

782
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:10,641
"I sing the body electric."

783
00:49:10,714 --> 00:49:13,478
"I sing the body electric."

784
00:49:13,550 --> 00:49:14,983
Oh my God!

785
00:49:15,052 --> 00:49:19,011
I sing the body electric!
I sing the body electric! Aah!

786
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:31,166
I definitely don't want kids
until I have a career.

787
00:49:31,234 --> 00:49:33,202
- Yeah. Me, too.
- You want kids?

788
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:34,669
Yeah, sure, I do.

789
00:49:34,738 --> 00:49:37,206
Why, you think
I shouldn't have kids?

790
00:49:37,274 --> 00:49:38,707
No, not at all.

791
00:49:38,775 --> 00:49:41,505
"This is the press
of the bashful hand,

792
00:49:41,578 --> 00:49:44,604
this is the float
and odor of hair.

793
00:49:45,782 --> 00:49:47,773
This is the touch
of my lips."

794
00:49:47,851 --> 00:49:50,445
"This is the touch
of my lips to yours,

795
00:49:50,520 --> 00:49:52,818
this is the murmur
of yearning,

796
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:55,449
this is the far-off
depth and height

797
00:49:55,525 --> 00:49:57,015
reflecting my own face..."

798
00:49:57,094 --> 00:49:59,528
"...thoughtful merge of myself,

799
00:49:59,596 --> 00:50:01,689
and the outlet again."

800
00:50:01,765 --> 00:50:04,928
I can't believe
this book is in our high school.

801
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:07,470
Yeah, but they usually leave
out all the good parts.

802
00:50:07,537 --> 00:50:10,005
This edition is unexpurgated.

803
00:50:10,073 --> 00:50:11,563
Un what?

804
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:14,007
It means it's the whole thing.

805
00:50:14,077 --> 00:50:15,908
"This is the touch
of my lips to yours."

806
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:17,844
I think what happens in high school
probably ends up

807
00:50:17,914 --> 00:50:19,472
being pretty irrelevant
later on in life.

808
00:50:19,549 --> 00:50:21,141
"This is the far off depth..."

809
00:50:21,218 --> 00:50:24,210
It's not as if people
check your math grades

810
00:50:24,287 --> 00:50:25,686
when you're 30 years old.

811
00:50:25,756 --> 00:50:29,157
Really. It's not like people
remember stuff like that

812
00:50:29,226 --> 00:50:30,557
when you're 30.

813
00:50:30,627 --> 00:50:32,561
- 30!
- 30!

814
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:37,623
Do you think we'll still know
each other when we're 30?

815
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:40,962
Do you?

816
00:50:41,038 --> 00:50:42,835
I don't know.

817
00:50:42,906 --> 00:50:45,568
It seems so far from now.

818
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:48,042
But I hope so.

819
00:50:48,111 --> 00:50:50,136
Me, too.

820
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:56,152
Evie, do you have something
you want to tell me?

821
00:50:58,422 --> 00:50:59,753
What?

822
00:50:59,823 --> 00:51:01,313
No.

823
00:51:01,391 --> 00:51:03,086
Honey,
if you can't tell me,

824
00:51:03,160 --> 00:51:05,287
you can't tell anyone,
you know that.

825
00:51:05,362 --> 00:51:06,795
Mom, why is it that every time

826
00:51:06,863 --> 00:51:08,125
I try and separate from you,

827
00:51:08,198 --> 00:51:10,132
which is a totally normal
adolescent impulse,

828
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:12,134
and in fact, crucial
to my adult development,

829
00:51:12,202 --> 00:51:13,635
you come back
with that weird thing

830
00:51:13,703 --> 00:51:16,001
about me telling you what
I can't tell the rest of the world?

831
00:51:16,073 --> 00:51:17,836
Okay, okay, fine.
Forget it.

832
00:51:17,908 --> 00:51:20,376
Forget it.
Absolutely fine.

833
00:51:26,116 --> 00:51:28,141
Thank you.

834
00:51:28,218 --> 00:51:30,186
You know, if you want
to shut me out

835
00:51:30,253 --> 00:51:32,016
during our final
weeks together

836
00:51:32,089 --> 00:51:33,522
before you go off to college,

837
00:51:33,590 --> 00:51:35,558
then you go right ahead.

838
00:51:35,625 --> 00:51:38,219
Mom, I'm not leaving
for, like, four months.

839
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:40,763
You're going to your father's
for the whole summer, Evie.

840
00:51:40,831 --> 00:51:43,026
Mom, you're experiencing
empty-nest syndrome

841
00:51:43,100 --> 00:51:44,533
before I'm even gone.

842
00:51:44,601 --> 00:51:46,034
I'm an adult now.

843
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,968
Oh, really?

844
00:51:48,038 --> 00:51:50,438
And I have to traverse
my own landscape.

845
00:51:50,507 --> 00:51:51,496
Huh.

846
00:51:51,575 --> 00:51:54,669
Call me old fashioned, but I thought that
was the sort of situation

847
00:51:54,744 --> 00:51:56,211
where a person goes
home to their ma,

848
00:51:56,279 --> 00:51:58,679
not their ex-lover
from seven years ago.

849
00:51:58,748 --> 00:51:59,976
You are old fashioned.

850
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:03,349
And where else is she going to go?
We are her family.

851
00:52:03,420 --> 00:52:05,012
This is our house.

852
00:52:05,088 --> 00:52:08,421
We have a teenager to raise
and it's small enough as it is.

853
00:52:08,492 --> 00:52:10,790
And we're poor.
Just add to it all.

854
00:52:10,861 --> 00:52:14,922
Look, I made a vow that my house
would always be open to people I love.

855
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:18,058
You and I both took that vow
when we moved in together.

856
00:52:18,135 --> 00:52:20,865
I needed it when I was young.

857
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:23,269
Randy needed it
when she moved in with us.

858
00:52:23,340 --> 00:52:24,967
Even you needed that once.

859
00:52:25,041 --> 00:52:26,975
No, I didn't.

860
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:28,840
No, I guess you didn't.

861
00:52:28,912 --> 00:52:31,574
Look, you can either take
this summer school course

862
00:52:31,648 --> 00:52:33,445
or you can go for the GED.

863
00:52:33,517 --> 00:52:36,008
Either way, you won't be wearing
a cap and gown this June.

864
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:39,714
There has to be some way
I can graduate in June.

865
00:52:39,789 --> 00:52:41,780
There's gotta be a way.

866
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:43,416
I told you
at the beginning of the year

867
00:52:43,493 --> 00:52:45,893
that you had
to pass math. That's the way.

868
00:52:45,962 --> 00:52:47,827
I mean, I think I've
done a lot to help you,

869
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:49,866
and you've refused
to help yourself.

870
00:52:49,933 --> 00:52:51,764
Take this letter to your aunt,

871
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:55,566
and have her sign it
and bring it back to me.

872
00:52:56,606 --> 00:52:58,335
You haven't
helped me at all!

873
00:53:02,045 --> 00:53:05,503
You know, I'm depraved
on account of I'm deprived.

874
00:53:05,582 --> 00:53:08,380
Can't you see that?

875
00:53:10,086 --> 00:53:13,988
Bring back
the letter... signed.

876
00:53:17,761 --> 00:53:20,889
I don't have enough credits
to graduate, Regina.

877
00:53:23,567 --> 00:53:25,535
What are you going to do?

878
00:53:25,602 --> 00:53:27,502
I don't know.

879
00:53:27,571 --> 00:53:30,096
Shoot myself in the head.

880
00:53:31,608 --> 00:53:34,475
You just met
someone you like.

881
00:53:34,544 --> 00:53:35,977
That's true.

882
00:53:36,046 --> 00:53:38,537
Man, if Rebecca finds out,

883
00:53:38,615 --> 00:53:41,049
my ass is grass.

884
00:53:41,117 --> 00:53:42,550
I'm sorry, babe.

885
00:53:44,120 --> 00:53:46,315
Randy Dean!

886
00:53:46,389 --> 00:53:49,381
De...
Randy!

887
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:51,324
Ali, what are you
doing here?

888
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:53,328
Come here! Come here!
Come here! Come here!

889
00:53:53,396 --> 00:53:55,796
Listen, you little twat,

890
00:53:55,865 --> 00:53:57,526
you dyke, you...

891
00:53:57,601 --> 00:54:00,035
stay the fuck away from my wife,
or I'm gonna mess you up good!

892
00:54:00,103 --> 00:54:01,570
Get the fuck off me!

893
00:54:01,638 --> 00:54:03,071
Get off her, Ali!

894
00:54:03,139 --> 00:54:04,504
Don't talk to me, Regina.

895
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:06,064
This is none of your business.

896
00:54:06,142 --> 00:54:08,770
I'm not... I'm not kidding around!

897
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:11,643
I haven't seen Wendy in weeks!

898
00:54:11,715 --> 00:54:13,649
There's nothing going on with us!

899
00:54:13,717 --> 00:54:14,979
Get the fuck off me!

900
00:54:15,051 --> 00:54:17,019
Anywhere near her,
I'll kill you!

901
00:54:17,087 --> 00:54:18,987
Maybe if you
treated her better,

902
00:54:19,055 --> 00:54:21,580
she wouldn't fool around
on you so much!

903
00:54:21,658 --> 00:54:23,091
Don't you insult me!

904
00:54:23,159 --> 00:54:24,490
I'm calling the police, Ali.

905
00:54:24,561 --> 00:54:25,994
I'm not kidding around.

906
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:27,529
Anywhere near her,

907
00:54:27,597 --> 00:54:28,723
I'll kill you.

908
00:54:28,798 --> 00:54:30,026
9-1...

909
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:31,533
I'll kill you.

910
00:54:32,602 --> 00:54:34,536
Shut up, you lard ass!

911
00:54:34,604 --> 00:54:38,040
Are you okay?

912
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:41,509
God, man,
what is she thinking...

913
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:43,045
fucking telling him
about us?

914
00:54:43,113 --> 00:54:45,547
She probably told him
to make him jealous.

915
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,048
She's such an idiot.

916
00:54:47,117 --> 00:54:51,053
Let's put something cold
on there.

917
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:55,554
Well, she did do a good job.

918
00:54:58,161 --> 00:55:00,493
Oh... perfect.

919
00:55:00,630 --> 00:55:02,029
Hi.

920
00:55:02,098 --> 00:55:03,258
Hi.

921
00:55:04,301 --> 00:55:05,791
Are you okay?

922
00:55:05,869 --> 00:55:07,598
Yeah, I'm fine,
I'm fine.

923
00:55:07,671 --> 00:55:10,504
Why are you holding
a popsicle to your neck?

924
00:55:10,573 --> 00:55:12,973
I got bit by a bug...

925
00:55:13,043 --> 00:55:15,978
a big, fat, ugly bug.

926
00:55:16,046 --> 00:55:19,982
Are you in a bad mood
or something?

927
00:55:21,017 --> 00:55:24,475
No. No, no.
I'm fine. No, I'm...

928
00:55:25,555 --> 00:55:27,682
It's good to see you.

929
00:55:32,095 --> 00:55:35,690
Um... listen, um...

930
00:55:37,567 --> 00:55:39,034
my mom is...

931
00:55:39,102 --> 00:55:40,535
Yeah?

932
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:44,039
She's... she's going away
in a couple of weeks,

933
00:55:44,107 --> 00:55:48,544
and, um... it's
during my birthday.

934
00:55:49,612 --> 00:55:51,170
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

935
00:55:51,247 --> 00:55:55,047
And... maybe you
could stay over

936
00:55:55,118 --> 00:55:56,745
and celebrate me turning 18.

937
00:55:56,820 --> 00:55:59,516
Well, that's great. You...

938
00:55:59,589 --> 00:56:02,683
I mean, you don't
turn 18 every day... right?

939
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:06,829
I mean, we could have a lot of fun,
you know, with my mom gone.

940
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:09,091
How long is
she going to be gone for?

941
00:56:09,165 --> 00:56:11,827
Friday through a Sunday.

942
00:56:26,549 --> 00:56:28,312
Honey!

943
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:30,876
Baby!

944
00:56:30,954 --> 00:56:32,444
Are you okay?

945
00:56:32,522 --> 00:56:35,958
Oh! I am so sorry
about all this mess!

946
00:56:36,025 --> 00:56:38,516
Evie, this is Wendy.

947
00:56:38,595 --> 00:56:40,028
Wendy, this is Evie.

948
00:56:40,096 --> 00:56:42,621
Pleased to meet you.

949
00:56:48,104 --> 00:56:49,799
Nice car.

950
00:56:49,873 --> 00:56:51,738
What are you doing here?

951
00:56:52,809 --> 00:56:56,142
I just came by to say
that you-know-who...

952
00:56:56,212 --> 00:56:59,670
he's all brawn,
and he's no bite.

953
00:56:59,749 --> 00:57:02,115
Thanks. Thanks
for the info.

954
00:57:06,055 --> 00:57:09,752
Well, just thought
I'd check in.

955
00:57:15,498 --> 00:57:18,524
If you need anything,
just give me a call, okay?

956
00:57:18,601 --> 00:57:21,695
Okey-doke.

957
00:57:29,112 --> 00:57:31,171
Do you love her?

958
00:57:33,082 --> 00:57:36,051
No. No!

959
00:57:40,089 --> 00:57:41,852
I love you.

960
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:12,847
Mono and diglycerides...

961
00:58:12,922 --> 00:58:14,355
Lena,
if you don't stop

962
00:58:14,424 --> 00:58:15,857
reading that stuff
out loud,

963
00:58:15,925 --> 00:58:17,586
I'm going to kill you.

964
00:58:21,197 --> 00:58:22,755
I'm staying at Frank's
this weekend.

965
00:58:22,832 --> 00:58:25,460
You haven't stayed over there
since you were in the ninth grade.

966
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:27,833
How come you're
going over there now?

967
00:58:27,904 --> 00:58:29,701
'Cause he broke up
with some boy,

968
00:58:29,772 --> 00:58:32,206
and he wants
some company. Poor Frank.

969
00:58:32,275 --> 00:58:33,936
Anyway, his mom's
gonna be out of town.

970
00:58:34,010 --> 00:58:36,137
How nice. You'll have the whole
house to yourselves.

971
00:58:36,212 --> 00:58:38,305
I don't know why you have
to go for the whole weekend.

972
00:58:38,381 --> 00:58:41,145
I don't know why you have to give me
such a hard time about everything.

973
00:58:41,217 --> 00:58:42,275
Leave her alone, Rebecca.

974
00:58:42,352 --> 00:58:44,183
Yeah, why don't you listen
to your girlfriend?

975
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:46,313
I'm a good egg.
Leave me alone.

976
00:58:46,389 --> 00:58:48,482
- She's a good egg, Rebecca.
- Stop bullshitting me.

977
00:58:48,558 --> 00:58:50,287
What, you don't believe me?

978
00:58:50,360 --> 00:58:52,487
You want to call him yourself?

979
00:58:52,562 --> 00:58:55,759
Hear about the boyfriend on the football
team who broke his heart?

980
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:00,133
Put the goddamn phone back.

981
00:59:05,909 --> 00:59:07,399
See?

982
00:59:12,415 --> 00:59:15,714
God, Evie, if you were
going to turn gay,

983
00:59:15,785 --> 00:59:18,345
you'd think you could at least
choose someone who's pretty.

984
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:20,355
I didn't say I was gay.

985
00:59:20,423 --> 00:59:21,856
I said I was in love.

986
00:59:21,925 --> 00:59:24,189
How come we didn't know
about this before?

987
00:59:24,260 --> 00:59:26,319
I mean, you don't seem gay.

988
00:59:26,396 --> 00:59:29,559
I think that you're under some kind
of spell or something.

989
00:59:29,632 --> 00:59:31,327
I am not.

990
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:33,869
I'm the same person
that I've always been.

991
00:59:33,937 --> 00:59:36,303
Underneath it all,
I am the same person.

992
00:59:37,373 --> 00:59:39,341
Underneath it all.

993
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,876
That's funny.

994
00:59:40,944 --> 00:59:42,878
Are you telling Hayjay?

995
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:44,345
No.

996
00:59:44,414 --> 00:59:46,382
Do you want us to tell him?

997
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:47,882
No!

998
00:59:47,951 --> 00:59:49,213
Well, who can we tell, then?

999
00:59:49,285 --> 00:59:50,877
No one.
This is just between us.

1000
00:59:50,954 --> 00:59:53,320
I really can't believe this.

1001
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:55,823
I mean,
this is totally insane.

1002
00:59:55,892 --> 00:59:58,486
Why do we have to be

1003
00:59:58,561 --> 01:00:00,791
the only people
with this information?

1004
01:00:00,863 --> 01:00:04,731
Well, Evie, how are we
supposed to process this?

1005
01:00:04,801 --> 01:00:06,962
In therapy, I guess.

1006
01:00:07,036 --> 01:00:09,834
Oh, shit. Are you guys going to go
to the prom together, too?

1007
01:00:09,906 --> 01:00:12,340
You know what?
I saw a movie about that.

1008
01:00:12,408 --> 01:00:14,842
Two girls went
to the prom together.

1009
01:00:14,911 --> 01:00:16,708
It was on cable.

1010
01:00:17,847 --> 01:00:19,838
Who cares about the prom?

1011
01:00:19,916 --> 01:00:22,476
I don't give a shit about the prom.

1012
01:00:22,552 --> 01:00:24,315
You're ruining your life, Evie.

1013
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:27,481
I'm sorry to say,
but I really think that.

1014
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:29,616
I think it's gross, Evie.

1015
01:00:29,692 --> 01:00:32,820
- Can I tell my mom?
- No!

1016
01:00:35,098 --> 01:00:37,157
Listen, if you guys
can't handle it,

1017
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:38,894
then you can just
dump me right now

1018
01:00:38,968 --> 01:00:41,198
and not be
my friends any more.

1019
01:00:41,270 --> 01:00:44,569
I'm telling you, though,
I am the same Evie.

1020
01:00:46,709 --> 01:00:48,677
If you can't take it,

1021
01:00:48,745 --> 01:00:51,873
then you can just get up and leave,
and we'll never have to speak again.

1022
01:01:21,878 --> 01:01:23,846
Um... you know,
you should see

1023
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:26,279
if you can get
that movie on video, Evie.

1024
01:01:26,349 --> 01:01:28,817
It was pretty good.

1025
01:01:43,032 --> 01:01:44,363
So what am I supposed to do

1026
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:46,095
if she calls to check up on you?

1027
01:01:46,169 --> 01:01:49,002
You say I'm in the shower,
and then you call me at Evie's.

1028
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:51,632
Tell me she called,
and I'll call her back.

1029
01:01:52,875 --> 01:01:55,275
I hate situations like this.

1030
01:01:55,344 --> 01:01:56,971
Why can't you just
tell her the truth?

1031
01:01:57,046 --> 01:02:00,311
'Cause I can't. I can't.

1032
01:02:00,383 --> 01:02:02,817
Just give me the number.

1033
01:02:02,885 --> 01:02:05,183
Don't lose it.

1034
01:02:08,891 --> 01:02:12,520
It's in my purse, okay?

1035
01:02:16,899 --> 01:02:20,665
Well, there's plenty of food.

1036
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:23,331
Mom, we always
have plenty of food.

1037
01:02:23,406 --> 01:02:25,340
I think I have everything.

1038
01:02:26,909 --> 01:02:28,604
Hold on a minute!

1039
01:02:29,912 --> 01:02:31,846
Okay, now I gave you
the telephone number

1040
01:02:31,914 --> 01:02:33,848
to the hotel
where the conference is

1041
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:35,349
and where I'll be staying.

1042
01:02:39,388 --> 01:02:40,855
You have
your father's number

1043
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:43,949
- in case of an emergency, god forbid.
- Right. Right.

1044
01:02:44,026 --> 01:02:46,324
Oh, I can't believe
I'm not going to be here

1045
01:02:46,395 --> 01:02:50,491
for my baby's
18th birthday. Ohhh.

1046
01:02:50,566 --> 01:02:52,727
Mom, everything's going
to be fine. I told you that.

1047
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:54,565
Good luck.
Have a good time.

1048
01:02:54,637 --> 01:02:56,400
Maybe you can invite
a friend over.

1049
01:02:56,472 --> 01:02:58,804
Rent a movie.
Make some popcorn.

1050
01:02:58,875 --> 01:03:01,503
And, Evie, you have
so many nice clothes.

1051
01:03:01,577 --> 01:03:03,477
Do you have to wear
this ugly vest?

1052
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:04,945
Goodbye, Mom.

1053
01:03:05,014 --> 01:03:07,778
Oh, I'm going
to miss you so much.

1054
01:03:07,850 --> 01:03:11,183
Oh, my sweet daughter.
I love her so much.

1055
01:03:11,254 --> 01:03:13,381
# She's my everything... #

1056
01:03:13,456 --> 01:03:14,650
Mom.

1057
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:18,785
# Everything,
everything. #

1058
01:03:18,861 --> 01:03:20,351
- Mom.
- Okay, okay.

1059
01:03:20,429 --> 01:03:21,828
Goodbye, sweetheart.

1060
01:03:21,898 --> 01:03:23,763
I'll call you
the minute the plane lands.

1061
01:03:23,833 --> 01:03:25,630
- Okay.
- Bye.

1062
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:27,328
Bye.

1063
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:30,637
- And, Evie...
- Yes.

1064
01:03:30,706 --> 01:03:32,230
Be by the phone
at five to 12:00.

1065
01:03:32,308 --> 01:03:34,868
I'm going to call you
the second you turn 18.

1066
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:36,536
Love you.

1067
01:04:01,370 --> 01:04:02,735
Bye, Lena!

1068
01:04:24,360 --> 01:04:25,793
Hi.

1069
01:04:25,862 --> 01:04:27,329
Hi.

1070
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:28,693
Come on in.

1071
01:04:34,403 --> 01:04:35,995
Okay.

1072
01:04:37,373 --> 01:04:39,864
This is me
when I was nine.

1073
01:04:41,410 --> 01:04:45,073
Ohh!
You were so cute!

1074
01:04:46,382 --> 01:04:47,872
I bet you were
already reading,

1075
01:04:47,950 --> 01:04:50,714
like, huge novels
and stuff like that.

1076
01:04:50,786 --> 01:04:53,277
Oh, stop.

1077
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:59,260
Oh, this is one of my dad.

1078
01:05:00,696 --> 01:05:02,459
He's handsome.

1079
01:05:02,531 --> 01:05:03,793
Your dad's really handsome.

1080
01:05:03,866 --> 01:05:05,697
Yeah, I guess he is.

1081
01:05:05,768 --> 01:05:07,258
What about your dad?

1082
01:05:07,336 --> 01:05:09,201
I don't know him.

1083
01:05:10,606 --> 01:05:12,301
I mean, he split
before I was born,

1084
01:05:12,375 --> 01:05:17,074
so I just make up
things about him in my head.

1085
01:05:20,883 --> 01:05:22,441
Oh my God,
you and your mom...

1086
01:05:22,518 --> 01:05:24,486
you're, like,
practically twins.

1087
01:05:24,553 --> 01:05:27,579
Oh, please. We're symbiotic
enough as it is.

1088
01:05:31,894 --> 01:05:34,829
Hey, um, do you want
something to eat?

1089
01:05:35,865 --> 01:05:37,492
Yeah.

1090
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:40,194
I'm really hungry
all of a sudden.

1091
01:05:41,637 --> 01:05:44,697
Goddamn it, you have
enough food to last a year.

1092
01:05:44,774 --> 01:05:46,674
There's more downstairs
in the freezer.

1093
01:05:46,742 --> 01:05:48,801
What do you want?

1094
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:50,971
I don't know yet.

1095
01:05:53,849 --> 01:05:56,249
You want to smoke
some of this?

1096
01:05:56,319 --> 01:05:58,981
Sure. I mean,
you only live once.

1097
01:06:17,873 --> 01:06:19,306
You okay?

1098
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:20,808
You all right?

1099
01:06:20,876 --> 01:06:22,468
Come on.

1100
01:06:24,280 --> 01:06:26,305
Do you like wine?

1101
01:06:26,382 --> 01:06:28,816
I don't know, really.

1102
01:06:28,884 --> 01:06:30,818
Okay.

1103
01:06:30,886 --> 01:06:33,184
Chteau Latour.

1104
01:06:33,255 --> 01:06:36,782
This is a really great cookbook... Antoine's.
It's amazing.

1105
01:06:36,859 --> 01:06:38,326
Who's Antoine?

1106
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:42,087
I don't know.

1107
01:06:42,164 --> 01:06:44,064
- You don't know?
- No.

1108
01:06:44,133 --> 01:06:45,828
Why do you have
his cookbook?

1109
01:06:47,436 --> 01:06:49,802
Is it supposed to be purple?

1110
01:06:50,873 --> 01:06:52,272
Well, it's the wine,

1111
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:54,241
the burgundy in the wine.

1112
01:06:54,310 --> 01:06:55,777
Taste it.

1113
01:06:55,845 --> 01:06:57,437
Come on.

1114
01:06:57,513 --> 01:06:59,845
All right,
you check on that.

1115
01:06:59,915 --> 01:07:02,076
Pepper.

1116
01:07:03,786 --> 01:07:06,846
Are you sure
we made this right?

1117
01:07:06,922 --> 01:07:08,389
Yeah, okay.

1118
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:13,795
Is it... what does it need?

1119
01:07:13,863 --> 01:07:14,887
- Spice?
- More wine.

1120
01:07:14,964 --> 01:07:16,898
- More wine?
- That's good.

1121
01:07:16,966 --> 01:07:18,524
- It's good?
- Yeah.

1122
01:07:18,601 --> 01:07:19,795
Let me taste it.

1123
01:07:19,869 --> 01:07:21,598
Okay, this might
be a little salty.

1124
01:07:23,572 --> 01:07:25,631
There's an orange
in there.

1125
01:07:25,708 --> 01:07:30,145
Orange...
it's for vitamin C.

1126
01:07:30,212 --> 01:07:32,305
We made it
through another day.

1127
01:07:32,381 --> 01:07:34,315
Hear! Hear!

1128
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:38,319
Wait.

1129
01:07:38,387 --> 01:07:40,184
Drink the whole thing.

1130
01:07:46,362 --> 01:07:48,626
Shit, you drank
the whole thing!

1131
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:55,331
I think we ate
everything in the house.

1132
01:07:56,372 --> 01:07:58,772
I think
I like wine now.

1133
01:07:58,841 --> 01:08:00,832
That wine
was really good.

1134
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:02,810
It was good, wasn't it?

1135
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:04,903
That's not your mom's favorite
or anything, is it?

1136
01:08:04,980 --> 01:08:07,676
No. She'll never
even notice.

1137
01:08:07,750 --> 01:08:10,844
Oh, what do you want
for dessert?

1138
01:08:10,920 --> 01:08:12,854
We already ate dessert...

1139
01:08:12,922 --> 01:08:15,356
when the duck was cooking.

1140
01:08:16,459 --> 01:08:20,054
Oh yeah, I forgot.

1141
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,995
What's symbiotic mean?

1142
01:08:32,875 --> 01:08:37,369
It means when you're
really, really close to someone...

1143
01:08:37,446 --> 01:08:39,846
like, too close...

1144
01:08:40,916 --> 01:08:43,817
like, um...

1145
01:08:43,886 --> 01:08:46,855
an infant and its mother.

1146
01:08:50,459 --> 01:08:52,120
I knew that.

1147
01:08:58,434 --> 01:09:01,870
Do you want to know
what happened to me today?

1148
01:09:04,907 --> 01:09:06,340
What?

1149
01:09:06,408 --> 01:09:09,809
I, um...

1150
01:09:09,879 --> 01:09:12,347
I lost...

1151
01:09:12,414 --> 01:09:14,507
I lost
all my friends today.

1152
01:09:16,152 --> 01:09:17,642
Did you tell them about us?

1153
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:19,711
Mm-hmm.

1154
01:09:19,788 --> 01:09:22,621
I could have told you
that was going to happen.

1155
01:09:22,691 --> 01:09:23,988
I'm sorry.

1156
01:09:24,059 --> 01:09:27,358
I just couldn't believe them.

1157
01:09:27,429 --> 01:09:29,420
I've known them since,
like, eighth grade.

1158
01:09:30,799 --> 01:09:32,767
People are gross.

1159
01:09:36,405 --> 01:09:38,873
Something happened
with me, too.

1160
01:09:38,941 --> 01:09:40,806
What?

1161
01:09:40,876 --> 01:09:43,436
I found out I don't have
enough credits to graduate.

1162
01:09:43,512 --> 01:09:47,243
Randy, why didn't
you tell me?

1163
01:09:47,316 --> 01:09:49,011
I could have helped you.

1164
01:09:49,084 --> 01:09:52,918
It's too late.
I'm failing math... again.

1165
01:09:52,988 --> 01:09:54,478
We'll work it out, okay?

1166
01:09:58,727 --> 01:10:03,164
I'm... I'm really stoned.

1167
01:10:15,244 --> 01:10:17,212
Hold out your arm.

1168
01:10:19,915 --> 01:10:22,315
Are you scared?

1169
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:24,045
Shit, no!

1170
01:10:25,854 --> 01:10:28,254
All right.
Well, close your eyes.

1171
01:10:36,131 --> 01:10:39,259
- Oh, I know what this is.
- What?

1172
01:10:39,335 --> 01:10:42,964
I have to guess
when you get right there.

1173
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:45,632
Right. So say "right there..."

1174
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:49,041
when I get right there,
and don't peek.

1175
01:10:49,111 --> 01:10:50,840
Okay.

1176
01:11:03,859 --> 01:11:06,327
Right there.

1177
01:11:06,395 --> 01:11:07,862
Oh!

1178
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:14,334
It's hard to tell
where right there is.

1179
01:11:15,371 --> 01:11:18,670
You are...
you are so beautiful

1180
01:11:31,387 --> 01:11:33,446
Go on.
Close your eyes.

1181
01:12:13,362 --> 01:12:16,820
I've never done this before.

1182
01:12:16,899 --> 01:12:19,800
Neither have I.

1183
01:12:19,868 --> 01:12:22,769
Oh, bullshit. Yes, you have.

1184
01:12:25,407 --> 01:12:27,170
No, I haven't.

1185
01:12:29,912 --> 01:12:31,971
I really haven't.

1186
01:14:34,403 --> 01:14:36,268
Whose shoe?

1187
01:14:43,879 --> 01:14:46,643
Oh my God.

1188
01:14:47,816 --> 01:14:50,649
Oh, no. Oh, no.

1189
01:14:51,753 --> 01:14:53,778
What in the world?

1190
01:14:55,190 --> 01:14:56,350
Huh-uh.

1191
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:11,305
Evie.

1192
01:15:11,373 --> 01:15:15,810
Evie, there's
somebody downstairs.

1193
01:15:15,878 --> 01:15:18,506
Evie! What if it's a murderer
or something?

1194
01:15:18,580 --> 01:15:19,638
Okay.

1195
01:15:26,889 --> 01:15:28,823
Shit!

1196
01:15:28,891 --> 01:15:30,620
That does it!

1197
01:15:30,692 --> 01:15:32,489
Evie!

1198
01:15:37,833 --> 01:15:40,267
Okay.

1199
01:15:43,405 --> 01:15:44,929
Honey, wake up!

1200
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:50,576
- Evie!
- Mom!

1201
01:15:57,085 --> 01:15:58,484
Evie!

1202
01:16:00,088 --> 01:16:02,818
Evie, listen to me!

1203
01:16:02,891 --> 01:16:04,916
You left the stereo on!

1204
01:16:04,993 --> 01:16:07,427
You drank
the Chteau Latour!

1205
01:16:07,496 --> 01:16:10,397
Everything is turned
upside down. Open this door!

1206
01:16:10,465 --> 01:16:13,229
I can explain everything!

1207
01:16:13,302 --> 01:16:16,100
Oh, yeah? Well, did you see
that goddamn kitchen?

1208
01:16:16,171 --> 01:16:18,537
- Just one second!
- Open this door! Open this door!

1209
01:16:18,607 --> 01:16:22,134
Goddamn! How can you
do this to me, Evie?

1210
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:24,405
How dare you!
How dare you!

1211
01:16:24,479 --> 01:16:26,913
You ruined the whole house!
Everything is a mess!

1212
01:16:26,982 --> 01:16:29,280
Everything is
turned upside down!

1213
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:30,682
Goddamn it,
open this door!

1214
01:16:30,752 --> 01:16:34,017
Mom, I am perfectly willing to accept the
consequences of whatever action.

1215
01:16:34,089 --> 01:16:37,058
- Oh, really?
- You just have to wait one second.

1216
01:16:37,125 --> 01:16:38,717
You're in big trouble,
young lady.

1217
01:16:38,794 --> 01:16:42,662
- Big time trouble!
- One second, Mom!

1218
01:16:42,731 --> 01:16:44,756
Get out of my house!
Get out!

1219
01:16:44,833 --> 01:16:46,926
- Evie!
- Mom!

1220
01:16:47,002 --> 01:16:49,903
It's a girl!
Get her out of here!

1221
01:16:58,847 --> 01:17:00,838
Just get in the car!

1222
01:17:02,951 --> 01:17:03,940
Now!

1223
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:06,385
Evie, you come back here!
You come...

1224
01:17:06,455 --> 01:17:08,286
Evelyn Roy,
I'm going to kill you!

1225
01:17:08,357 --> 01:17:10,791
Do you hear me?
I'm going to kill you!

1226
01:17:10,859 --> 01:17:13,555
I can't believe
I'm driving your car.

1227
01:17:13,629 --> 01:17:16,063
- Just drive. Just drive.
- Fuck, we should go back!

1228
01:17:16,131 --> 01:17:18,031
We should go back
and clean the kitchen.

1229
01:17:18,100 --> 01:17:20,762
I'll be cleaning the kitchen
for the rest of my life. Just drive.

1230
01:17:20,836 --> 01:17:22,770
- Where?
- I don't know.

1231
01:17:26,375 --> 01:17:28,275
Vicky, where's
my Rolling Stones tape?

1232
01:17:28,343 --> 01:17:30,334
I think Randy borrowed it.

1233
01:17:32,881 --> 01:17:35,679
God, this room is a mess.

1234
01:17:40,355 --> 01:17:41,822
Wallace High School.

1235
01:17:41,890 --> 01:17:43,824
What is this?

1236
01:17:43,892 --> 01:17:45,553
Vicky!

1237
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:53,334
Fuck! Can you believe this?

1238
01:17:53,402 --> 01:17:55,802
This room smells bad.

1239
01:17:55,871 --> 01:17:57,338
What did you expect?

1240
01:17:57,406 --> 01:18:00,637
A heart-shaped bathtub
and satin sheets?

1241
01:18:00,709 --> 01:18:04,076
We're in a sleazebag motel,
running away from your mom.

1242
01:18:04,146 --> 01:18:05,306
Shut up.

1243
01:18:06,348 --> 01:18:08,543
I know why we're here.

1244
01:18:10,452 --> 01:18:12,852
How are we going
to pay for this room?

1245
01:18:12,921 --> 01:18:14,855
We can't stay here forever.

1246
01:18:14,923 --> 01:18:16,322
You should have stayed.

1247
01:18:16,391 --> 01:18:19,019
You should have stayed
and dealt with your mom.

1248
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:25,695
I should have stayed
and dealt with my mom?

1249
01:18:25,767 --> 01:18:28,167
You should have stayed.
You could have helped me.

1250
01:18:28,236 --> 01:18:30,033
What, like,
I'm going to stay there

1251
01:18:30,105 --> 01:18:32,335
while she's screaming,
"It's a girl! It's a girl!

1252
01:18:34,042 --> 01:18:35,373
Get out of the house."

1253
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:37,878
Yeah,
I should have stayed.

1254
01:18:37,946 --> 01:18:39,607
Who are we going to call?

1255
01:18:40,949 --> 01:18:43,645
I don't even have
any friends left.

1256
01:18:45,420 --> 01:18:47,388
That's not my fault.

1257
01:18:48,423 --> 01:18:50,254
Yes, it is.

1258
01:18:50,325 --> 01:18:52,520
No, it's not.

1259
01:18:52,594 --> 01:18:55,392
You're the one who wanted
to hold hands in the diner.

1260
01:18:58,400 --> 01:19:00,061
Whatever.

1261
01:19:02,070 --> 01:19:03,298
Goddamn it.

1262
01:19:03,371 --> 01:19:05,066
"Goddamn it."

1263
01:19:18,487 --> 01:19:19,818
Hello.

1264
01:19:19,888 --> 01:19:21,822
- Hello, Frank.
- Oh, hi, Rebecca.

1265
01:19:21,890 --> 01:19:23,255
I have a simple request, Frank.

1266
01:19:23,325 --> 01:19:26,192
I would like to speak
with my niece Randall right now.

1267
01:19:26,261 --> 01:19:27,592
She's in the shower
right now.

1268
01:19:27,662 --> 01:19:29,220
Can I have
her call you right back?

1269
01:19:29,297 --> 01:19:32,198
Tell her to call me immediately
and explain this letter from Wallace.

1270
01:19:32,267 --> 01:19:34,360
Right. Yes, sir...
ma'am.

1271
01:19:34,436 --> 01:19:36,028
Letter from Wallace.
Okay.

1272
01:19:45,514 --> 01:19:48,483
Evie.
Evie, is this you?

1273
01:19:50,018 --> 01:19:52,612
Uh, yes, is Randy there?

1274
01:19:52,687 --> 01:19:54,882
Who is this? Randy who?

1275
01:19:54,956 --> 01:19:56,446
Randy who? That girl?

1276
01:19:56,525 --> 01:19:58,459
Is that who you're asking for?
That girl?

1277
01:19:58,527 --> 01:20:00,290
Who is this?
Where's my daughter?

1278
01:20:00,362 --> 01:20:03,126
I think I have the wrong number.
Sorry to bother you.

1279
01:20:03,198 --> 01:20:05,758
I know you know
where my daughter is. Where is she?

1280
01:20:05,834 --> 01:20:06,960
Sorry. Sorry, ma'am.

1281
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:08,468
You should see my dining room!

1282
01:20:08,537 --> 01:20:11,233
Look at it! Look at it!
Just look at it!

1283
01:20:11,306 --> 01:20:14,036
Goodbye now.
Sorry.

1284
01:20:18,814 --> 01:20:21,874
I really owe you one.
I promise to pay you back.

1285
01:20:22,984 --> 01:20:26,010
Okay. You know where it is?

1286
01:20:26,087 --> 01:20:28,351
Um, it's off Route 7.

1287
01:20:29,424 --> 01:20:31,187
Room number seven.

1288
01:20:31,259 --> 01:20:33,250
Okay. Thanks.

1289
01:20:33,328 --> 01:20:36,593
Okay. All right. Bye.

1290
01:20:52,314 --> 01:20:53,440
Hello?

1291
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:55,073
Frank, it's me.

1292
01:20:55,150 --> 01:20:58,142
Oh God, girl, am I glad it's you.
You are in big trouble.

1293
01:20:58,220 --> 01:21:00,415
Rebecca called here,
and she found that letter

1294
01:21:00,488 --> 01:21:03,821
from the guidance counselor
and you are in big trouble now.

1295
01:21:03,892 --> 01:21:05,291
Fuck! Fuck!

1296
01:21:05,360 --> 01:21:07,590
Where are you?

1297
01:21:07,662 --> 01:21:10,324
Rebecca, calm down. She's going
through a rebellious phase.

1298
01:21:10,398 --> 01:21:11,558
This is all very normal.

1299
01:21:11,633 --> 01:21:13,794
"I'm sorry to inform you
that your niece Randall Dean

1300
01:21:13,869 --> 01:21:15,996
will not have enough credits
to graduate this year."

1301
01:21:16,071 --> 01:21:18,266
She spent too much time
with her girlfriend.

1302
01:21:18,340 --> 01:21:21,036
That's not true, Rebecca. You know
she's always had a hard time in school.

1303
01:21:21,109 --> 01:21:22,440
It's not Evie's fault.

1304
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:25,001
"To receive a diploma, she'll have
to attend summer school,

1305
01:21:25,080 --> 01:21:27,014
or she may opt
for the GED program."

1306
01:21:27,082 --> 01:21:29,209
So she has to stay home
awhile longer. That's okay.

1307
01:21:29,284 --> 01:21:30,751
Yeah, everything's
fine so far.

1308
01:21:50,038 --> 01:21:52,165
Rebecca, I know Randy
has a good explanation.

1309
01:21:52,240 --> 01:21:55,801
If she gets a GED, she'll be working
at the gas station the rest of her life!

1310
01:21:57,245 --> 01:21:59,406
- Hello.
- Rebecca?

1311
01:21:59,481 --> 01:22:03,042
You're in big trouble, young lady.
Yes, you are.

1312
01:22:03,118 --> 01:22:06,144
Because I find out about you
not being able to graduate is what!

1313
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:07,779
- I was going to tell you.
- Oh, really?

1314
01:22:07,856 --> 01:22:10,324
Yes, I was... was too
going to tell you. Yes l...

1315
01:22:10,392 --> 01:22:12,189
- Like when?
- When you get home from work.

1316
01:22:12,260 --> 01:22:14,125
But you haven't been home.
I haven't seen you.

1317
01:22:14,195 --> 01:22:16,629
Where the hell are you?
I thought you were at Frank's.

1318
01:22:16,698 --> 01:22:18,029
Tell me where you are!

1319
01:22:18,099 --> 01:22:20,090
- I'm on the road.
- What road?

1320
01:22:20,168 --> 01:22:22,363
I'm just
on the fucking road, okay?!

1321
01:22:22,437 --> 01:22:23,836
Get home now.

1322
01:22:23,905 --> 01:22:25,338
I'm hanging up.
Hanging up.

1323
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:29,036
Hanging up,
Hanging uuuup.

1324
01:22:38,286 --> 01:22:40,254
I'm going to kill her.

1325
01:22:47,429 --> 01:22:49,488
Rebecca knows.

1326
01:22:49,564 --> 01:22:52,658
She knows
I'm not going to graduate.

1327
01:22:52,734 --> 01:22:53,928
This is so fucked.

1328
01:22:54,002 --> 01:22:56,664
I'm going to be grounded
for the rest of my life.

1329
01:22:59,874 --> 01:23:01,808
I got us some money.

1330
01:23:01,876 --> 01:23:04,811
We can split. We can stay.

1331
01:23:07,849 --> 01:23:10,716
"To think that you and I
did not bear our part.

1332
01:23:12,554 --> 01:23:15,318
To think that you and I

1333
01:23:15,390 --> 01:23:17,381
are now here
and bear our part."

1334
01:23:21,896 --> 01:23:24,091
Are you listening to me?

1335
01:23:26,901 --> 01:23:29,768
Frank said your mom's
having a nervous breakdown.

1336
01:23:33,408 --> 01:23:35,205
Oh my God.

1337
01:23:37,045 --> 01:23:38,307
I've got to call her.

1338
01:23:38,380 --> 01:23:40,348
I don't have
any quarters left.

1339
01:23:40,415 --> 01:23:42,280
I've got a calling card.

1340
01:23:46,888 --> 01:23:48,913
What am I gonna say to her?

1341
01:23:52,761 --> 01:23:54,729
Calm down.
Mrs. Roy, calm down.

1342
01:23:54,796 --> 01:23:56,024
Where are they?

1343
01:23:56,097 --> 01:23:58,998
If we can just find them,
I'm sure we can work this out.

1344
01:23:59,067 --> 01:24:01,331
- Now, where's your house?
- Where are they?

1345
01:24:09,878 --> 01:24:12,108
That's weird.
The machine's on.

1346
01:24:12,180 --> 01:24:14,205
I swear I don't know
where they are.

1347
01:24:14,282 --> 01:24:16,546
Frank, do you want us
to torture you or what?

1348
01:24:16,618 --> 01:24:18,813
You already are torturing me.

1349
01:24:18,887 --> 01:24:20,582
Don't hurt him, darling.

1350
01:24:20,655 --> 01:24:22,953
Frank, you have
to tell us where they are.

1351
01:24:23,024 --> 01:24:25,322
We have a major crisis
on our hands.

1352
01:24:25,393 --> 01:24:27,327
I'll let you borrow
my boxing gloves, Frank.

1353
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:28,487
Oh, Jeez.

1354
01:24:44,412 --> 01:24:46,505
Yoo-hoo!
Honey, it's me.

1355
01:24:51,853 --> 01:24:55,653
Well, hello,
my little lovebirds.

1356
01:24:57,358 --> 01:25:00,020
Mmm... kind
of smells bad in here, huh?

1357
01:25:00,095 --> 01:25:01,960
Yeah, we know.
Did you bring money?

1358
01:25:02,030 --> 01:25:05,796
Yeah. Got it.
There you go.

1359
01:25:05,867 --> 01:25:08,267
Thanks.
We'll pay you back.

1360
01:25:08,336 --> 01:25:11,271
Thank you, Wendy, for coming
over here on such short notice.

1361
01:25:11,339 --> 01:25:12,931
Oh, honey,
don't worry about it.

1362
01:25:13,007 --> 01:25:15,305
I mean, I just rolled Ali
over this morning,

1363
01:25:15,376 --> 01:25:16,934
took it
out of his back pocket.

1364
01:25:17,011 --> 01:25:18,945
He's not going
to even know the difference.

1365
01:25:20,381 --> 01:25:21,905
What's your plan, girls?

1366
01:25:21,983 --> 01:25:23,814
This is as fast as it goes.

1367
01:25:23,885 --> 01:25:25,409
All right, all right,
all right, all right.

1368
01:25:25,487 --> 01:25:27,114
Calm down, everyone.
Just calm down.

1369
01:25:27,188 --> 01:25:28,382
We want to get there alive.

1370
01:25:48,910 --> 01:25:50,605
Wendy!

1371
01:25:51,980 --> 01:25:53,971
...chased us
down the street.

1372
01:25:54,048 --> 01:25:56,448
Wendy!

1373
01:25:56,518 --> 01:25:57,610
I was in my bare feet...

1374
01:25:57,685 --> 01:25:58,879
Wendy,
I know you're in here!

1375
01:25:58,953 --> 01:26:01,786
Oh, shit,
that's Ali. Damn it.

1376
01:26:01,856 --> 01:26:04,290
Get out of here.
Bathroom, bathroom.

1377
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:06,259
Come out of there, Wendy!

1378
01:26:06,327 --> 01:26:08,261
Wendy, I know you're in there!

1379
01:26:08,329 --> 01:26:09,990
Would you stop yelling, Ali?

1380
01:26:10,064 --> 01:26:11,759
Who the hell is Ali?

1381
01:26:11,833 --> 01:26:13,300
Wendy's husband.

1382
01:26:13,368 --> 01:26:16,769
Great! This is just great!

1383
01:26:16,838 --> 01:26:19,773
I know you're in there, Wendy!

1384
01:26:19,841 --> 01:26:23,504
Stop yelling, Ali.
It's still early.

1385
01:26:23,578 --> 01:26:25,569
All right.

1386
01:26:25,647 --> 01:26:27,615
Where is she?
I told that little dyke

1387
01:26:27,682 --> 01:26:30,207
if I caught her messing around
with you again, I was gonna kill her.

1388
01:26:30,285 --> 01:26:31,843
Whatever are
you talking about?

1389
01:26:31,920 --> 01:26:33,615
Oh, don't bullshit me,
Wendy.

1390
01:26:33,688 --> 01:26:36,953
She's not here.
I swear it.

1391
01:26:41,429 --> 01:26:43,397
Who are you?

1392
01:26:43,464 --> 01:26:44,829
Who are you?

1393
01:26:44,899 --> 01:26:46,890
See, I told you
she wasn't here.

1394
01:26:46,968 --> 01:26:48,458
Is this another one?

1395
01:26:48,536 --> 01:26:52,734
No, no, no.
Ali, Evie here is a friend.

1396
01:26:52,807 --> 01:26:55,435
She is running away
from her murderous boyfriend,

1397
01:26:55,510 --> 01:26:56,772
and I came here to help her.

1398
01:26:56,844 --> 01:26:58,869
- That is all.
- Is that true?

1399
01:26:58,947 --> 01:27:02,280
Wendy saved my life.
I had nobody else to turn to.

1400
01:27:02,350 --> 01:27:04,648
I had nobody else to call.
I didn't know what to do.

1401
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:07,779
All right, all right.
Don't get hysterical.

1402
01:27:07,855 --> 01:27:10,551
Now, Evie, Ali and I
have to get to church.

1403
01:27:10,625 --> 01:27:11,956
Are you gonna be okay?

1404
01:27:12,026 --> 01:27:14,790
You need a lift
or anything?

1405
01:27:14,862 --> 01:27:17,057
Oh, no, thank you.
I have my car.

1406
01:27:17,131 --> 01:27:19,258
She's got
that Range Rover out there.

1407
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:20,323
Nice car.

1408
01:27:20,401 --> 01:27:22,961
- Okay, now, Evie, you take care, girl.
- Bye.

1409
01:27:24,872 --> 01:27:26,305
Oh my God.

1410
01:27:26,374 --> 01:27:29,309
You were great.
You were great.

1411
01:27:29,377 --> 01:27:31,311
I've never lied
that well before.

1412
01:27:32,847 --> 01:27:34,212
I got him!
I got him!

1413
01:27:45,393 --> 01:27:49,329
Okay, we'll knock
on every door till we find 'em.

1414
01:27:49,397 --> 01:27:51,331
- Evie!
- Randy!

1415
01:27:55,536 --> 01:27:58,004
Evie!

1416
01:27:59,407 --> 01:28:01,136
Oh, it's your mom.

1417
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:03,109
It's okay.
Just come out.

1418
01:28:03,177 --> 01:28:05,168
Just come out, Evie.
Please, just come out.

1419
01:28:05,246 --> 01:28:07,908
Randy Dean!

1420
01:28:07,982 --> 01:28:10,610
Oh my God,
they're all out there.

1421
01:28:10,685 --> 01:28:12,346
Oh my God,
oh my God.

1422
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:15,856
Oh my God, Evie.
Evie, think.

1423
01:28:15,923 --> 01:28:17,823
Oh my God!
Oh my God!

1424
01:28:17,892 --> 01:28:18,859
Evie!

1425
01:28:20,428 --> 01:28:21,486
Fuck!

1426
01:28:24,432 --> 01:28:27,868
Hi, I'm looking
for two teenage girls.

1427
01:28:27,935 --> 01:28:30,870
Did our husbands send you?

1428
01:28:30,938 --> 01:28:34,339
No matter what happens,
you know I love you.

1429
01:28:34,409 --> 01:28:36,877
We need a list of demands.

1430
01:28:36,944 --> 01:28:38,844
I'm sorry I fucked up
your 18th birthday.

1431
01:28:39,881 --> 01:28:41,815
We're not coming out
of the room

1432
01:28:41,883 --> 01:28:43,373
until they meet
those demands.

1433
01:28:43,451 --> 01:28:45,214
What do we want?

1434
01:28:49,924 --> 01:28:52,757
Randy Dean, we know
you're in there. Come out now!

1435
01:28:53,828 --> 01:28:56,058
We want to be together,
and we want you to graduate.

1436
01:28:56,130 --> 01:28:58,291
That's not really a demand.

1437
01:28:58,366 --> 01:29:00,425
We want you to have a tutor
so you can graduate.

1438
01:29:00,501 --> 01:29:02,628
Come on out, you two!
We know you're in here!

1439
01:29:02,704 --> 01:29:05,935
We have a list of demands.
We're not leaving until they're met.

1440
01:29:06,007 --> 01:29:08,441
Stop this bullshit right now!

1441
01:29:08,509 --> 01:29:10,534
"There are times
when I felt that

1442
01:29:10,611 --> 01:29:12,340
kissing Liota wasn't enough,

1443
01:29:12,413 --> 01:29:15,814
but I wasn't sure what the next step would
be, so until I knew..."

1444
01:29:15,883 --> 01:29:18,113
- Hey, isn't that Evie's car?
- Where?

1445
01:29:19,921 --> 01:29:21,445
Evie!

1446
01:29:21,522 --> 01:29:23,854
I am 18 now, Mom,

1447
01:29:23,925 --> 01:29:25,950
and I can make
my own decisions.

1448
01:29:26,027 --> 01:29:28,689
Evie, Mommy's going
to get you some therapy, honey.

1449
01:29:28,763 --> 01:29:31,857
All you need is a little therapy,
just a little therapy.

1450
01:29:31,933 --> 01:29:34,231
I'm not the one
who needs therapy, Mom.

1451
01:29:34,302 --> 01:29:36,463
Did you hear
what she just said to me?

1452
01:29:36,537 --> 01:29:38,869
Baby, you are grounded for life!
Get out here!

1453
01:29:38,940 --> 01:29:40,635
All right, Evie, come out!

1454
01:29:40,708 --> 01:29:42,335
Both of you come out now!

1455
01:29:42,410 --> 01:29:44,071
- Now!
- Come on!

1456
01:29:46,214 --> 01:29:49,980
- Who are you married to here?
- I'm married to you.

1457
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:52,645
This is hopeless.

1458
01:29:52,720 --> 01:29:54,278
We should just
give ourselves up.

1459
01:29:54,355 --> 01:29:56,323
Hi, Mrs. Roy.

1460
01:29:56,391 --> 01:29:58,689
Oh, hi, ladies. Hi, ladies.
How you doing?

1461
01:29:58,760 --> 01:30:00,819
Look, we're having
a little crisis on our hands.

1462
01:30:00,895 --> 01:30:02,419
We're trying to get Evie

1463
01:30:02,497 --> 01:30:04,692
to come out
with her new friend... Randy?

1464
01:30:04,766 --> 01:30:06,563
Randy's already out,
Mrs. Roy.

1465
01:30:06,634 --> 01:30:08,226
I don't think
that's what she meant.

1466
01:30:08,302 --> 01:30:11,829
You've got money.
You're going to college.

1467
01:30:11,906 --> 01:30:14,807
You're way smarter than me.

1468
01:30:15,910 --> 01:30:17,844
That is all bullshit.

1469
01:30:17,912 --> 01:30:20,506
So you guys go
to Wallace High School?

1470
01:30:26,921 --> 01:30:31,051
You swear
that you'll love me forever?

1471
01:30:33,428 --> 01:30:35,259
I swear.

1472
01:30:38,099 --> 01:30:40,693
I swear
I'll love you forever.

1473
01:30:49,444 --> 01:30:51,469
Open the door.

1474
01:30:54,882 --> 01:30:56,474
Hold my hand.

1475
01:31:19,273 --> 01:31:21,207
"There is that in me..."

1476
01:31:21,275 --> 01:31:23,175
"I do not know what it is..."

1477
01:31:23,244 --> 01:31:25,769
"But I know it is in me."

1478
01:31:25,847 --> 01:31:27,781
"I do not know it..."

1479
01:31:27,849 --> 01:31:29,282
"It is without name..."

1480
01:31:29,350 --> 01:31:32,217
"It is a word unsaid..."

1481
01:31:32,286 --> 01:31:35,722
"It is not in any dictionary,

1482
01:31:35,790 --> 01:31:38,281
or utterance,
or symbol."

1483
01:31:38,359 --> 01:31:40,793
"Something it swings on

1484
01:31:40,862 --> 01:31:44,025
more than the earth
I swing on..."

1485
01:31:44,098 --> 01:31:46,896
"To it the creation is the friend

1486
01:31:46,968 --> 01:31:49,300
whose embracing awakes me."

1487
01:31:49,370 --> 01:31:51,201
Let's change that

1488
01:31:51,272 --> 01:31:54,673
to "girlfriend
whose embracing awakes me."

1489
01:31:54,742 --> 01:31:57,540
Yeah, change it to girlfriend.
