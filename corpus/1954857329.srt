1
00:00:01,634 --> 00:00:03,002
Ladies and gentlemen,

2
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:06,171

for Ms. Wanda Sykes!

3
00:00:11,044 --> 00:00:12,945

00:00:22,589 --> 00:00:25,024

00:00:25,091 --> 00:00:27,126
¶ I'ma be me

10
00:00:27,193 --> 00:00:30,362
¶ yeah.

11
00:00:30,430 --> 00:00:32,498
¶ Thinkin' about
the changes in my life ¶

12
00:00:32,565 --> 00:00:33,632
thank you, thank you.

13
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:37,703
Thank you,
thank you so much, D.C.

14
00:00:40,106 --> 00:00:41,440
Thank you, D.C.

15
00:00:41,508 --> 00:00:44,810
Oh, my goodness,
so happy to be here.

16
00:00:44,878 --> 00:00:47,813
Be back in D.C.

17
00:00:51,284 --> 00:00:53,919
You know, the last time
I was here...

18
00:00:59,626 --> 00:01:04,696
I caused a little trouble.

19
00:01:04,764 --> 00:01:10,803
President laughed,
and he got in trouble.

20
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:12,871
What the problem is,
they don't know

21
00:01:12,939 --> 00:01:17,643
that I was holding back.

22
00:01:17,710 --> 00:01:20,145
Not tonight, baby.

23
00:01:20,213 --> 00:01:21,380
Not tonight.

24
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:23,615
Uh-uh, tonight...

25
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:34,059
Tonight I'm gonna say some shit.

26
00:01:34,127 --> 00:01:36,161
I'm going for one
of those beer summits.

27
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:38,430
That's what I'm doing.

28
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:41,934
We love you!

29
00:01:42,001 --> 00:01:43,735
I love y'all too, baby.

30
00:01:43,803 --> 00:01:45,737
Love y'all too.

31
00:01:45,805 --> 00:01:47,072
I'm telling you,
it's so good--

32
00:01:47,140 --> 00:01:50,642
Sister be in D.C.
when the first black president--

33
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:52,077
Come on.

34
00:01:53,113 --> 00:01:55,347
What?

35
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:00,719
First black president.

36
00:02:00,787 --> 00:02:04,256
But I got to tell you,
it's a little bittersweet.

37
00:02:04,324 --> 00:02:05,591
It is.

38
00:02:05,658 --> 00:02:08,527
First black president,
and the country is broke.

39
00:02:08,595 --> 00:02:11,530
What the fuck?

40
00:02:14,968 --> 00:02:17,703
That's fucked up.

41
00:02:17,770 --> 00:02:23,542
It's like everybody went,
"mm, we broke.

42
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:26,778
"Let's give
that black guy a shot.

43
00:02:29,215 --> 00:02:30,516
"He can't hurt anything.

44
00:02:30,583 --> 00:02:32,951
What..."

45
00:02:33,019 --> 00:02:34,186
The fuck?

46
00:02:34,254 --> 00:02:35,454
Plus, you know black people,

47
00:02:35,522 --> 00:02:38,157
they know about being broke.

48
00:02:38,224 --> 00:02:40,359
Maybe he could use
some of his trickery

49
00:02:40,426 --> 00:02:43,495
and get us out of this fix.

50
00:02:43,563 --> 00:02:46,498
You know, maybe put the country
in his cousin's name

51
00:02:46,566 --> 00:02:49,668
and hide our shit.

52
00:02:55,508 --> 00:02:59,845
We all get free cable.

53
00:02:59,913 --> 00:03:02,247
Maybe he can get
another country to move in

54
00:03:02,315 --> 00:03:04,349
and split the bills.

55
00:03:04,417 --> 00:03:06,285
Jeez.

56
00:03:06,352 --> 00:03:08,387
That's messed up, man.

57
00:03:08,454 --> 00:03:09,655
You know what,
I got to tell you.

58
00:03:09,722 --> 00:03:12,691
I don't care why we have
a first black president.

59
00:03:12,759 --> 00:03:14,626
I'm just happy to have one.

60
00:03:14,694 --> 00:03:15,661
I am.

61
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:22,267
And, boy, we got one cool
black president, don't we?

62
00:03:22,335 --> 00:03:23,835
Damn, he's cool.

63
00:03:23,903 --> 00:03:26,405
I don't know how
the man keeps his cool.

64
00:03:26,472 --> 00:03:29,007
All the shit
that gets thrown at him,

65
00:03:29,075 --> 00:03:30,943
people just fucking
with him all the time.

66
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:35,080
The birthers calling him
a racist,

67
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:36,915
comparing him to Hitler.

68
00:03:36,983 --> 00:03:38,183
What the hell?

69
00:03:38,251 --> 00:03:39,985
How does he stay so cool?

70
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:44,022
Is he still smoking weed?

71
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,427
"Hey, Nazi."

72
00:03:53,633 --> 00:03:57,970
"No, that's okay,
that's okay, that's okay."

73
00:04:02,408 --> 00:04:03,742
I love it.

74
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:05,777
Every time you see him walk
into that helicopter,

75
00:04:05,845 --> 00:04:07,546
I love seeing him
take that stroll

76
00:04:07,614 --> 00:04:09,615
across
the white house lawn, boy.

77
00:04:09,682 --> 00:04:10,916
It's just beautiful.

78
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:12,744
You see him,
he just walking across the lawn.

79
00:04:32,372 --> 00:04:35,440
He didn't do that shit
during the campaign, did he?

80
00:04:35,508 --> 00:04:37,442
Naw, he was stiff
as a motherfucker

81
00:04:37,510 --> 00:04:39,244
during the campaign.

82
00:04:39,312 --> 00:04:41,713
It's like he was counting
that shit out in his head.

83
00:04:41,781 --> 00:04:47,419
He was like, "okay,
one, two, wave, smile.

84
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:52,057
"One, two, wave, smile.

85
00:04:52,125 --> 00:04:53,765
"Whatever you do,
do not touch your penis.

86
00:04:53,826 --> 00:04:56,762
"Do not...

87
00:05:02,302 --> 00:05:03,602
"You touch your dick,
it's all over.

88
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:06,605
"Do not touch your dick.

89
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:12,144
"Stop looking at Michelle's ass.

90
00:05:12,211 --> 00:05:13,679
"Oh, jeez, okay.

91
00:05:13,746 --> 00:05:14,813
"You don't have a dick.

92
00:05:14,881 --> 00:05:17,883
Don't, don't..."

93
00:05:17,950 --> 00:05:19,351
First black president.

94
00:05:19,419 --> 00:05:22,587
I'm so happy 'cause now
I can relax a little bit.

95
00:05:22,655 --> 00:05:24,523
You know, I can loosen up.

96
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:29,795
Don't have to be so black
all the time.

97
00:05:29,862 --> 00:05:31,997
Don't have to be so dignified.

98
00:05:32,065 --> 00:05:33,565
You know, 'cause we did it.

99
00:05:33,633 --> 00:05:35,967
Black folks, we always got
to be dignified.

100
00:05:36,035 --> 00:05:37,736
Yeah, 'cause we know
if we fuck up,

101
00:05:37,804 --> 00:05:41,039
we just set everybody else back
a couple of years, right?

102
00:05:41,107 --> 00:05:42,708
Boy, we should have killed
flavor flav,

103
00:05:42,775 --> 00:05:44,643
like, ten years ago.

104
00:05:44,711 --> 00:05:45,677
We would have...

105
00:05:52,518 --> 00:05:57,789
He has been holding us back.

106
00:05:57,857 --> 00:05:59,191
But we did it.

107
00:05:59,258 --> 00:06:01,026
Now I can relax a little bit.

108
00:06:01,094 --> 00:06:03,161
I can do some shit.

109
00:06:03,229 --> 00:06:06,064
I can--i can--
I can dance on camera.

110
00:06:06,132 --> 00:06:08,133
I couldn't dance
on camera before.

111
00:06:08,201 --> 00:06:09,368
When I was growing up,
my mother,

112
00:06:09,435 --> 00:06:12,437
she wouldn't even
let us dance in the car.

113
00:06:12,505 --> 00:06:13,638
You know, we sitting
in the car,

114
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,474
a good song come
on the radio, we...

115
00:06:15,541 --> 00:06:17,109
¶ Mm mmm mm mm

116
00:06:17,176 --> 00:06:18,310
¶ mm mm mm

117
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:21,146
my mother's like,
she would stop the car.

118
00:06:21,214 --> 00:06:25,016
"Uh, do you want to dance
or do you want to ride?

119
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,319
"'Cause you ain't dancing
in my car.

120
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:32,124
White people are looking
at you."

121
00:06:32,191 --> 00:06:33,425
We're like, "huh?"

122
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,861
"White people are looking
at you."

123
00:06:35,928 --> 00:06:37,329
I'm like, "what--

124
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:41,032
Oh, damn."

125
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,535
She was right.

126
00:06:43,603 --> 00:06:46,304
So I had that shit in my head,
couldn't do that.

127
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:48,039
Couldn't dance,
couldn't dance on camera.

128
00:06:48,107 --> 00:06:49,574
But now, shit,
I can dance.

129
00:06:49,642 --> 00:06:51,076
We got a black president.

130
00:06:51,144 --> 00:06:54,980
Not only can I dance,
I can tap dance.

131
00:06:57,083 --> 00:06:59,050
You know what
dignified black people hate?

132
00:06:59,118 --> 00:07:01,686
Tap dancing.

133
00:07:04,524 --> 00:07:07,659
Hate that shit.

134
00:07:07,727 --> 00:07:11,163
Like, "look at that damn
bojangles just setting us back.

135
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,999
How we gonna get ahead she up
there looking like bojangles?"

136
00:07:20,873 --> 00:07:21,807
Now I can dance.

137
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:23,308
I can do some other shit.

138
00:07:23,376 --> 00:07:27,612
I can buy whole watermelons now.

139
00:07:30,616 --> 00:07:32,818
I no longer have to grow them
in my closet

140
00:07:32,885 --> 00:07:37,456
under my weed lamp.

141
00:07:41,327 --> 00:07:42,961
Before I would go
in a grocery store

142
00:07:43,029 --> 00:07:45,063
and I would look
at the whole watermelons.

143
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:49,000
I was like, "damn,
they look good.

144
00:07:49,068 --> 00:07:53,472
"Boy, I would like
to get a whole watermelon.

145
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:57,943
"Look at all these white people
looking at me.

146
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,250
"Fuck you, whitey.

147
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:09,721
"I ain't buying a whole
watermelon for your enjoyment.

148
00:08:09,789 --> 00:08:13,758
"I'm gonna go over here
to the salad bar.

149
00:08:13,826 --> 00:08:16,862
"Take my dignified
to the salad bar

150
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:21,633
"and get the sliced watermelon.

151
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:31,243
"Let me camouflage this shit
with some cantaloupe.

152
00:08:40,086 --> 00:08:45,123
Good day, sir."

153
00:08:45,191 --> 00:08:46,958
Now I got a black president.

154
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:47,959
You should see me.

155
00:08:48,027 --> 00:08:49,267
I walking out the grocery store

156
00:08:49,295 --> 00:08:50,929
with the watermelon
on my shoulder.

157
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:54,599
"Yeah.

158
00:08:54,667 --> 00:08:57,836
Obama, bitch."

159
00:09:03,476 --> 00:09:05,410
Shit.

160
00:09:05,478 --> 00:09:07,445
I hope he gets
a second term.

161
00:09:07,513 --> 00:09:09,347
Then I'm going to popeyes.

162
00:09:18,591 --> 00:09:21,026
You'll see me
in the popeyes drive-through

163
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:24,462
dancing and eating watermelon.

164
00:09:30,803 --> 00:09:32,243
We got to make
some adjustments, man.

165
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:36,074
You know, got to get used
to having a black first lady.

166
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:38,343
Got to get used
to that, right?

167
00:09:38,411 --> 00:09:41,212
That's why we had all
those articles, you know,

168
00:09:41,280 --> 00:09:42,447
when he first got in office,

169
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,884
like, "who is the real
Michelle Obama?"

170
00:09:45,952 --> 00:09:50,188
"When will we see
the real Michelle Obama?"

171
00:09:50,256 --> 00:09:51,723
You know what they're saying.

172
00:09:51,791 --> 00:09:54,259
"When are we gonna see this?"

173
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:15,380
"No, you need to take care
of your baby.

174
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,383
You need to take care
of your baby."

175
00:10:34,834 --> 00:10:38,570
Well, you're not gonna see that
from Michelle Obama.

176
00:10:38,638 --> 00:10:42,974
And we all don't do that.

177
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:48,546
And I happen to know
for a fact

178
00:10:48,614 --> 00:10:50,148
that during the campaign,

179
00:10:50,216 --> 00:10:53,018
she had rods implanted
in her neck

180
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:57,689
so she is incapable
of doing that.

181
00:11:00,526 --> 00:11:02,927
You see sometimes she wants to,
but she can't.

182
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:05,296
She got...

183
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:27,619
It's like everybody just waiting
for one of those rods to snap

184
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,187
and for her
to get pissed one night

185
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:32,924
and throw all his shit
out on the white house lawn.

186
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:38,930
"Fuck you, Barack.

187
00:11:38,998 --> 00:11:41,399
"You ain't shit.

188
00:11:41,467 --> 00:11:44,402
You ain't shit."

189
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,411
Michelle's mother
comes to the door.

190
00:11:53,479 --> 00:11:55,313
"Baby, please, Michelle,

191
00:11:55,381 --> 00:11:57,215
"you gonna get
that boy impeached.

192
00:11:57,283 --> 00:11:59,718
"Please, baby.

193
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:04,122
"Get in the house.
Get in the house.

194
00:12:04,190 --> 00:12:07,192
White people are looking
at you."

195
00:12:18,070 --> 00:12:21,172
We got to get used to having
a beautiful first lady too.

196
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:22,540
First lady...

197
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:29,414
First lady who likes
to show some skin.

198
00:12:29,482 --> 00:12:30,849
I like that.

199
00:12:30,916 --> 00:12:33,785
Giving her some shit
'cause she went sleeveless.

200
00:12:33,853 --> 00:12:35,320
All right, the country is broke.

201
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:38,123
Sleeves cost money, all right?

202
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:47,432
Giving her shit
'cause she was wearing shorts.

203
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,433
I like that.

204
00:12:48,501 --> 00:12:49,534
She should show her skin.

205
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:50,635
She has beautiful skin.

206
00:12:50,703 --> 00:12:51,803
She has beautiful arms.

207
00:12:51,871 --> 00:12:53,171
Show those arms off.

208
00:12:53,239 --> 00:12:56,608
Right, now, some
of the previous first ladies,

209
00:12:56,675 --> 00:12:59,544
yeah, they needed sleeves.

210
00:13:02,648 --> 00:13:07,085
Barbara bush should have been
in a poncho her whole time.

211
00:13:13,793 --> 00:13:18,463
All that flapping around.

212
00:13:18,531 --> 00:13:23,768
Nobody wanted to see that.

213
00:13:23,836 --> 00:13:28,406
I'm like, at least tattoo
the flag on there or something.

214
00:13:32,845 --> 00:13:33,778
I love that.

215
00:13:33,846 --> 00:13:35,180
Show your arms off, Michelle.

216
00:13:35,247 --> 00:13:36,948
That's right.
You got nice arms.

217
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:39,150
And, plus, you let all
those other

218
00:13:39,218 --> 00:13:41,386
little floozy girls out there,

219
00:13:41,453 --> 00:13:42,954
let all them little interns
and shit,

220
00:13:43,022 --> 00:13:44,489
no, let them know,

221
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,592
"all right, you can try some
shit with my man if you want to,

222
00:13:47,660 --> 00:13:51,496
"but you gonna get one
of these babies

223
00:13:51,564 --> 00:13:54,032
around your scrawny neck."

224
00:14:06,178 --> 00:14:07,312
What I don't even have--

225
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:08,847
I don't even think
we have to worry

226
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:10,849
about anything going on

227
00:14:10,916 --> 00:14:13,718
or anybody messing with him,
where they're messing around,

228
00:14:13,786 --> 00:14:16,354
'cause, you know,
I met them at that dinner,

229
00:14:16,422 --> 00:14:19,224
and you could feel
the energy between them.

230
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:23,361
Let me tell you,
they fucking.

231
00:14:23,429 --> 00:14:27,565
Oh, yeah.

232
00:14:30,369 --> 00:14:33,104
There's some fucking going on

233
00:14:33,172 --> 00:14:36,307
at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue.

234
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:45,483
They should put a sign
out on the white house lawn.

235
00:14:45,551 --> 00:14:47,218
"If the white house
is a-rockin',

236
00:14:47,286 --> 00:14:50,655
don't come a-knockin'."

237
00:14:50,723 --> 00:14:53,024
There's some good hot sex
going on there.

238
00:14:53,092 --> 00:14:56,928
I mean, we talking ass slapping,
ear pulling.

239
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:01,933
"Oh, you want
my stimulus package? Huh?"

240
00:15:02,001 --> 00:15:03,067
Pfff!

241
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:04,535
"You want
my stimulus package? Huh?"

242
00:15:04,603 --> 00:15:05,770
Pfff!

243
00:15:05,838 --> 00:15:08,239
"You want
my stimulus package?"

244
00:15:13,846 --> 00:15:15,613
I know I keep saying
the first black president,

245
00:15:15,681 --> 00:15:16,981
and, yes, I know
that he's biracial,

246
00:15:17,049 --> 00:15:18,016
but I don't care.

247
00:15:18,083 --> 00:15:20,285
He's the first black president.

248
00:15:20,352 --> 00:15:21,920
Well...

249
00:15:21,987 --> 00:15:24,722
That's unless he fucks up.

250
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:31,162
And if he fucks up, I'm gonna be
the first one to say,

251
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:34,799
"who voted
for the half white guy?

252
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:39,470
"Get that mulatto out of there.

253
00:15:39,538 --> 00:15:43,508
He stinks."

254
00:15:46,979 --> 00:15:49,514
And there's a lot
of areas where he can fuck up

255
00:15:49,581 --> 00:15:51,816
'cause, good lord, the man got
problems all over the place,

256
00:15:51,884 --> 00:15:53,251
huh?

257
00:15:53,319 --> 00:15:54,485
All kind of problems.

258
00:15:54,553 --> 00:15:55,887
And then people
were fucking with him

259
00:15:55,955 --> 00:15:57,455
for stuff that, you know--

260
00:15:57,523 --> 00:15:59,691
Just, like, shit that they
shouldn't even bother him with.

261
00:15:59,758 --> 00:16:02,894
You know, like criticizing him
about their choice of dog,

262
00:16:02,962 --> 00:16:04,762
what kind of dog
are they gonna get.

263
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,131
And then, you know,
spca got on him about,

264
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:09,534
"oh, how come he
didn't get a shelter dog?

265
00:16:09,601 --> 00:16:12,270
"How come the president
didn't get a rescue dog?

266
00:16:12,338 --> 00:16:14,272
He should have gotten
a rescue dog."

267
00:16:14,340 --> 00:16:16,441
I'm like, "the man has
to rescue a country

268
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:20,478
that's been abused
by its previous owner."

269
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:23,281
Honestly.

270
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,223
Let him have a fresh start
with a dog.

271
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:32,791
Damn.

272
00:16:36,595 --> 00:16:38,363
And then--you know,
then there were problems,

273
00:16:38,430 --> 00:16:39,564
like out of nowhere.

274
00:16:39,631 --> 00:16:41,199
Not just your normal problems,

275
00:16:41,266 --> 00:16:43,101
you know, like,
like, you know, the economy

276
00:16:43,168 --> 00:16:45,036
and the two wars
that are going on.

277
00:16:45,104 --> 00:16:47,905
No, then he start getting
all these extra problems,

278
00:16:47,973 --> 00:16:50,541
like swine flu.

279
00:16:50,609 --> 00:16:51,976
And pirates?

280
00:16:52,044 --> 00:16:55,213
What the fuck? Pirates?

281
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,051
Really?

282
00:17:00,119 --> 00:17:03,755
Pirates? Where the fuck
did pirates come from?

283
00:17:06,959 --> 00:17:09,394
I bet you he thought
rahm Emanuel

284
00:17:09,461 --> 00:17:13,564
was punking him when he came
in there with that shit.

285
00:17:13,632 --> 00:17:15,400
"Mr. president,
one of our vessels

286
00:17:15,467 --> 00:17:19,103
has been taken by pirates."

287
00:17:23,008 --> 00:17:24,842
"That's a good one, rahm.
Get the fuck out of here.

288
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:28,446
Get the fuck out of here."

289
00:17:37,990 --> 00:17:39,090
Pirates.

290
00:17:39,158 --> 00:17:40,792
I was so pissed
when I saw that.

291
00:17:40,859 --> 00:17:42,160
I'm like, "pirates?"

292
00:17:42,227 --> 00:17:43,694
And then when I looked,
then I was like,

293
00:17:43,762 --> 00:17:44,962
"these aren't pirates.

294
00:17:45,030 --> 00:17:46,998
"Them motherfuckers
don't look like pirates.

295
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:51,636
They look like a bunch
of carjackers on water."

296
00:17:51,703 --> 00:17:53,571
Why are we fucking
with these little kids?

297
00:17:53,639 --> 00:17:56,741
It was like, "oh,
well, they had machine guns."

298
00:17:56,809 --> 00:17:59,710
What? Have you seen how big
these cargo ships are?

299
00:17:59,778 --> 00:18:01,345
They're enormous.

300
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:03,047
They had machine guns.

301
00:18:03,115 --> 00:18:05,850
Well, only way a gun can
hurt you when you on that ship

302
00:18:05,918 --> 00:18:10,788
is if you stick your stupid head
off the side

303
00:18:10,856 --> 00:18:15,393
and look down at the pirates.

304
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,995
And who are these
shitty ass captains

305
00:18:18,063 --> 00:18:22,533
allowing these little kids
to take their big ass boat?

306
00:18:22,601 --> 00:18:24,268
That's a shitty captain.

307
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:25,770
If I'm the captain,
they say,

308
00:18:25,838 --> 00:18:32,076
"uh, captain,
there's some pirates, uh...

309
00:18:32,144 --> 00:18:37,014
"Yeah, there's some pirates
down there.

310
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:44,922
"Oh, yeah, I just caught
a bullet, look. See?

311
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,560
Yeah, pirates are down there."

312
00:18:49,628 --> 00:18:50,962
You the captain.

313
00:18:51,029 --> 00:18:53,297
All you got to do
is take that wheel

314
00:18:53,365 --> 00:18:57,301
and do one of these.

315
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:05,309
"Oh, yeah, they're gone.
They're gone."

316
00:19:09,148 --> 00:19:11,415
Fucking pirates.

317
00:19:11,483 --> 00:19:12,950
I was so pissed.

318
00:19:13,018 --> 00:19:14,352
You know, and the one
that we caught,

319
00:19:14,419 --> 00:19:16,154
we should make an example
out of him.

320
00:19:16,221 --> 00:19:18,089
Yeah, they should chop
his leg off

321
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:20,925
and stick
a broom handle up there,

322
00:19:20,993 --> 00:19:23,060
put a hook on his hand,

323
00:19:23,128 --> 00:19:25,163
stick a parrot on his shoulder,

324
00:19:25,230 --> 00:19:27,165
slap an eye patch on him,

325
00:19:27,232 --> 00:19:30,768
and kick his ass back
to Somalia.

326
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:34,572
That's a fucking pirate.

327
00:19:39,444 --> 00:19:40,764
We're a nation of dummies.
We are.

328
00:19:40,779 --> 00:19:42,680
Don't want to learn new shit.

329
00:19:42,748 --> 00:19:44,782
Our education system stinks.

330
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:47,485
We really do need
to revamp our education system.

331
00:19:47,553 --> 00:19:48,986
It doesn't work.

332
00:19:49,054 --> 00:19:51,722
It does not work.

333
00:19:53,258 --> 00:19:56,260
That's why we have shows,

334
00:19:56,328 --> 00:19:59,797
"are you smarter
than a fifth-grader?"

335
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,600
You know how piss poor that is?

336
00:20:02,668 --> 00:20:07,104
And I haven't seen anybody win.

337
00:20:07,172 --> 00:20:09,707
People sitting at home,
playing along.

338
00:20:09,775 --> 00:20:14,045
"Ooh, I think I know this one."

339
00:20:14,112 --> 00:20:15,613
You're supposed to.

340
00:20:15,681 --> 00:20:18,349
You're 32,
you dumb motherfucker.

341
00:20:26,425 --> 00:20:29,894
We need to just revamp
our education system.

342
00:20:29,962 --> 00:20:32,196
'Cause you know what,
we don't learn anything.

343
00:20:32,264 --> 00:20:34,599
It's never compre--you know,
it's not comprehension.

344
00:20:34,666 --> 00:20:36,467
It's just retention.
It's just rote.

345
00:20:36,535 --> 00:20:37,468
That's it.

346
00:20:37,536 --> 00:20:38,869
We never get it.

347
00:20:38,937 --> 00:20:42,240
We just keep it long enough
to spit it back out,

348
00:20:42,307 --> 00:20:44,976
pass the test, then we get rid
of that shit, right?

349
00:20:45,043 --> 00:20:46,683
It's like the teacher
gives you something,

350
00:20:46,712 --> 00:20:48,646
you go, "okay, okay,
I got that.

351
00:20:48,714 --> 00:20:50,548
"Time for the test?
Okay, here you go.

352
00:20:50,616 --> 00:20:51,749
Giving it back to you."

353
00:20:51,817 --> 00:20:53,384
Done with that,
it's like our brain

354
00:20:53,452 --> 00:20:54,452
is a big etch a sketch.

355
00:20:54,553 --> 00:20:57,421
We go...

356
00:20:59,291 --> 00:21:03,094
"Okay.

357
00:21:03,161 --> 00:21:07,064
Next subject."

358
00:21:10,102 --> 00:21:12,069
Immigration--
There's another problem.

359
00:21:12,137 --> 00:21:15,006
That's another problem
on the president's desk, right?

360
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:16,874
Another problem,
immigration.

361
00:21:16,942 --> 00:21:18,342
You know,
it really pisses me off

362
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,945
when people, like,
call them illegal immigrants.

363
00:21:21,013 --> 00:21:23,080
"Oh, these illegal immigrants."

364
00:21:23,148 --> 00:21:24,582
You know,
there's nothing illegal.

365
00:21:24,650 --> 00:21:27,018
They're just
undocumented workers, that's it.

366
00:21:27,085 --> 00:21:29,353
You know, it's nothing like--
Anything, like, criminal.

367
00:21:29,421 --> 00:21:30,721
I mean, really.

368
00:21:30,789 --> 00:21:37,962
If somebody broke
into my house and vacuumed...

369
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:51,409
I mean, I might be
a little confused,

370
00:21:51,476 --> 00:21:55,780
but I ain't calling the cops.

371
00:21:58,216 --> 00:22:00,351
But some people
get so arrogant, boy,

372
00:22:00,419 --> 00:22:02,953
get so arrogant
and so hard on--

373
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:04,655
You know,
on the undocumented workers,

374
00:22:04,723 --> 00:22:07,291
get so hard on people
who weren't born here.

375
00:22:07,359 --> 00:22:08,626
You know, I'm like,
get people--

376
00:22:08,694 --> 00:22:10,361
They just want to come here
for a better life.

377
00:22:10,429 --> 00:22:11,862
Give them a fair shake.

378
00:22:11,930 --> 00:22:13,664
You know, and, plus...

379
00:22:16,668 --> 00:22:18,936
And, plus, there's
a few Americans

380
00:22:19,004 --> 00:22:24,375
I would love to trade out for a
couple of undocumented workers.

381
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,414
Shit, I'll take two Guatemalans,
a Mexican,

382
00:22:30,482 --> 00:22:34,518
and a boatload of Haitians
for octomom any day.

383
00:22:42,961 --> 00:22:46,364
She's got to go.

384
00:22:46,431 --> 00:22:48,532
Change is hard.
It's hard to make changes.

385
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:50,134
Hard to make changes.

386
00:22:50,202 --> 00:22:52,203
Look at how hard it was
for us to get

387
00:22:52,270 --> 00:22:54,772
a first latina judge, huh?

388
00:22:54,840 --> 00:22:56,540
Yeah, justice...

389
00:22:58,543 --> 00:23:01,312
Justice Sonia sotomayor.

390
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:02,880
So happy she got on the bench.

391
00:23:02,948 --> 00:23:05,750
Look, they gave her
so much shit, you know?

392
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:07,418
Isn't funny that the only time

393
00:23:07,486 --> 00:23:09,687
your race
or gender is questioned

394
00:23:09,755 --> 00:23:12,890
is when you're not
a white man?

395
00:23:17,529 --> 00:23:20,030
See, I think white men, they
get upset, they get nervous.

396
00:23:20,098 --> 00:23:22,967
Like, a minority or another race
gets a little power,

397
00:23:23,034 --> 00:23:24,535
it makes them nervous,

398
00:23:24,603 --> 00:23:27,371
'cause they scared that
that race is gonna do to them

399
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:30,007
what they did to that race.

400
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,009
They get nervous.

401
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:34,445
So they start screaming,
"reverse racism,

402
00:23:34,513 --> 00:23:36,313
this is reverse racism."

403
00:23:36,381 --> 00:23:38,282
I'm like, wait a minute,
isn't reverse racism--

404
00:23:38,350 --> 00:23:40,951
Isn't that when a racist
is nice to somebody else?

405
00:23:41,019 --> 00:23:45,356
Isn't that--to other people?

406
00:23:45,424 --> 00:23:47,124
That's reverse racism.

407
00:23:47,192 --> 00:23:52,163
What you're afraid of
is called Karma.

408
00:23:54,032 --> 00:23:55,866
Yeah.

409
00:24:00,372 --> 00:24:02,706
I'm so happy she's
on the bench.

410
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:04,341
I'm so happy she's
on the bench.

411
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:05,476
You know, good for her.

412
00:24:05,544 --> 00:24:07,077
And all the problems
they gave her

413
00:24:07,145 --> 00:24:08,579
and talking shit--

414
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,381
You know, 'cause, you know,
she's on there now,

415
00:24:10,449 --> 00:24:12,116
so once you on the bench,
once you're a justice,

416
00:24:12,184 --> 00:24:13,551
you're always a justice.

417
00:24:13,618 --> 00:24:14,919
So if I was her,
the first day

418
00:24:14,986 --> 00:24:16,487
I would have walked in there
wearing a robe

419
00:24:16,555 --> 00:24:20,591
made out
of the puerto rican flag.

420
00:24:25,831 --> 00:24:30,401
<i>"Mira, Mira."</i>

421
00:24:39,778 --> 00:24:43,347
Every time justice
John Roberts says something,

422
00:24:43,415 --> 00:24:44,682
she should just roll her eyes
and go,

423
00:24:44,749 --> 00:24:47,084
"pfff, that was dumb."

424
00:24:51,022 --> 00:24:52,289
A lot of changes, man.

425
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:53,991
I had a lot of personal changes
going in my life,

426
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:54,959
a lot of personal changes.

427
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:56,327
I got married.

428
00:24:56,394 --> 00:24:57,628
Yep.

429
00:24:57,696 --> 00:24:58,829
Got married.

430
00:25:02,868 --> 00:25:04,902
Happily married.

431
00:25:04,970 --> 00:25:06,971
Got married in California.

432
00:25:07,038 --> 00:25:09,473
You know, then I had
to publicly come out,

433
00:25:09,541 --> 00:25:11,208
had to do that.

434
00:25:11,276 --> 00:25:13,110
Had to.

435
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:19,316
I had to do it,
especially after prop. 8.

436
00:25:19,384 --> 00:25:22,953
After that prop. 8,
you know, fiasco in California,

437
00:25:23,021 --> 00:25:25,022
I had to come out,
I had to say something,

438
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:29,460
'cause I was so hurt
and so fucking pissed.

439
00:25:29,528 --> 00:25:32,196
I had to say something,
had to say something, man.

440
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:34,198
'Cause you know what, it was
like that night was crazy.

441
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,233
Yay.

442
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:37,902
Oh, prop. 8 passed.

443
00:25:37,969 --> 00:25:39,837
Oh, shit, now I'm
a second class citizen.

444
00:25:39,905 --> 00:25:41,171
What the fuck?

445
00:25:41,239 --> 00:25:44,208
I was up here,
now I'm back down here.

446
00:25:44,276 --> 00:25:45,543
Actually, I'm lower.

447
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:46,810
I dropped lower.

448
00:25:46,878 --> 00:25:48,479
You know,
'cause as a black woman,

449
00:25:48,547 --> 00:25:50,748
at least as a black woman,
I could do whatever,

450
00:25:50,815 --> 00:25:52,016
marry whoever.

451
00:25:52,083 --> 00:25:54,084
But as a gay black woman,
uh-uh.

452
00:25:54,152 --> 00:25:55,586
Even lower.

453
00:25:55,654 --> 00:25:56,987
You know, and I think about it.

454
00:25:57,055 --> 00:25:58,455
I was like, you know what,
it is harder.

455
00:25:58,523 --> 00:25:59,857
It's harder.

456
00:25:59,925 --> 00:26:01,892
It's harder being gay
than it is being black.

457
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:04,361
It is, 'cause there's
some things that I had--

458
00:26:04,429 --> 00:26:08,365
There's--there's some things
that I had to do as gay

459
00:26:08,433 --> 00:26:10,100
that I didn't have
to do as black.

460
00:26:10,168 --> 00:26:15,039
I didn't have to come out black.

461
00:26:19,911 --> 00:26:21,912
I didn't have
to sit my parents down

462
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:26,517
and tell them
about my blackness.

463
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:30,187
I didn't have to sit them down.

464
00:26:30,255 --> 00:26:35,059
"Mom, dad, I got
to tell y'all something.

465
00:26:35,126 --> 00:26:38,529
"I hope you still love me.

466
00:26:38,597 --> 00:26:41,365
"I'm just gonna say it.

467
00:26:41,433 --> 00:26:44,301
"Mom, dad...

468
00:26:44,369 --> 00:26:46,503
I'm black."

469
00:26:46,571 --> 00:26:48,806
"What?
What did she just say?

470
00:26:48,873 --> 00:26:50,808
"Oh, lord Jesus,
she didn't say 'black, ' lord.

471
00:26:50,875 --> 00:26:51,742
Did she say 'black?'"

472
00:26:51,810 --> 00:26:52,910
"mom, I'm black."

473
00:26:52,978 --> 00:26:54,445
"Oh, lord, lord Jesus.

474
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:56,981
"Lord, lord, father god.

475
00:26:57,048 --> 00:26:59,917
"Oh, bless, bless, lord.

476
00:26:59,985 --> 00:27:05,356
"Anything but black, Jesus.

477
00:27:05,423 --> 00:27:06,824
"Give her cancer, lord.

478
00:27:06,891 --> 00:27:09,560
"Give her cancer.

479
00:27:09,628 --> 00:27:13,130
Anything but black, lord."

480
00:27:13,198 --> 00:27:15,032
It's like, "mom, yeah,
I'm black.

481
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,220
I'm--that's just how it is."

482
00:27:16,267 --> 00:27:17,534
"No.

483
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:18,669
"No, you know what?

484
00:27:18,737 --> 00:27:21,872
You been hanging
around black people."

485
00:27:23,775 --> 00:27:25,542
"You been hanging
around black people,

486
00:27:25,610 --> 00:27:28,145
"and they got you thinking
you black.

487
00:27:28,213 --> 00:27:30,447
They twisted your mind."

488
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:32,616
It's like, "no, mom,
I'm black.

489
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:33,984
That's just how it is."

490
00:27:34,052 --> 00:27:38,656
"Oh, what--
What did I do?

491
00:27:38,723 --> 00:27:40,290
"What did I do?

492
00:27:40,358 --> 00:27:42,092
"I knew I shouldn't
have let you watch <i>soul train.</i>

493
00:27:42,160 --> 00:27:44,495
Was it <i>soul train?"</i>

494
00:27:51,903 --> 00:27:54,004
"No, ma,
it wasn't <i>soul train,</i> ma.

495
00:27:54,072 --> 00:27:55,806
"It's just who I am.

496
00:27:55,874 --> 00:27:57,541
I was just born black."

497
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:58,909
"Oh, you weren't born black.

498
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:00,077
"I don't want to hear that.

499
00:28:00,145 --> 00:28:01,912
"Uh-uh, you weren't born black.

500
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:07,651
The Bible says "Adam and Eve,"
not "Adam and Mary j. Blige."

501
00:28:14,993 --> 00:28:16,694
I think the problem
most people have

502
00:28:16,761 --> 00:28:20,297
with homosexuality
is, you know, the religion,

503
00:28:20,365 --> 00:28:22,099
and also they think
it's a choice.

504
00:28:22,167 --> 00:28:24,401
Being gay is not a choice.

505
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:26,437
It's not a choice.

506
00:28:31,142 --> 00:28:33,377
It is not a choice.

507
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,379
And so if you believe
that it's a choice,

508
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,681
then you're saying that
straight people are straight

509
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:40,951
because they chose not
to be gay.

510
00:28:41,019 --> 00:28:42,653
Right?

511
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,788
And I'm sure a lot
of straight guys in here,

512
00:28:44,856 --> 00:28:46,356
you know I'm talking
about them.

513
00:28:46,424 --> 00:28:49,493
Sure, there's several occasions,
you know, you probably think,

514
00:28:49,561 --> 00:28:54,298
"you know, I think I'm gonna
suck a dick today.

515
00:29:09,280 --> 00:29:12,082
Nah, I choose not to."

516
00:29:17,088 --> 00:29:18,122
That's funny.

517
00:29:18,189 --> 00:29:19,323
It's great being out.

518
00:29:19,390 --> 00:29:21,191
I love being publicly out

519
00:29:21,259 --> 00:29:23,994
and just everything out
on the table.

520
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:26,997
I am what I am.

521
00:29:27,065 --> 00:29:29,066
That's it.

522
00:29:29,134 --> 00:29:30,434
Happy about it.

523
00:29:30,502 --> 00:29:33,871
Now I get invited
to all the big gay events too.

524
00:29:33,938 --> 00:29:37,107
And, boy, there's a lot of them.

525
00:29:37,175 --> 00:29:39,042
Phew. Good grief.

526
00:29:39,110 --> 00:29:40,778
But, you know,
one I got to do,

527
00:29:40,845 --> 00:29:41,812
I had a great time.

528
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:42,946
I did a gay cruise.

529
00:29:43,014 --> 00:29:44,481
Yeah, gay cruise.

530
00:29:44,549 --> 00:29:48,919
Me and 3,200 gay men.

531
00:29:51,022 --> 00:29:55,192
I was the only one wearing
a shirt.

532
00:29:59,063 --> 00:30:00,631
And you talk about party?

533
00:30:00,698 --> 00:30:03,567
Oh, my god,
they partied they asses off,

534
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:07,004
non-stop just party,
party, party, party.

535
00:30:07,071 --> 00:30:09,907
And I can still hear
that music in my head, that...

536
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:16,346
¶ Waaaah

537
00:30:16,414 --> 00:30:19,416
what the fuck is that?

538
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:20,984
Are there pirates?
Are there pirates?

539
00:30:21,052 --> 00:30:23,086
What is that?

540
00:30:27,458 --> 00:30:28,892
Party, man.

541
00:30:28,960 --> 00:30:32,296
The music,
the lights, the laser beams,

542
00:30:32,363 --> 00:30:33,931
the smoke machines--

543
00:30:33,998 --> 00:30:38,802
And all that was just coming
from the cabin next door.

544
00:30:46,711 --> 00:30:49,413
We partied hard, man.

545
00:30:49,480 --> 00:30:50,948
And also I got some free time,

546
00:30:51,015 --> 00:30:52,575
you know, 'cause my shows
were at night,

547
00:30:52,617 --> 00:30:54,184
so during the day
we got to hang out.

548
00:30:54,252 --> 00:30:55,786
You know, like,
on the pool deck,

549
00:30:55,854 --> 00:30:57,087
I could hang out.

550
00:30:57,155 --> 00:30:58,655
And, you know, my friends
were with me

551
00:30:58,723 --> 00:31:00,724
and my wife was with me.

552
00:31:00,792 --> 00:31:02,092
We were just hanging out, right?

553
00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:04,127
And the--

554
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:07,631
She gets up and she starts
walking towards the pool.

555
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:10,534
And I'm looking,
I'm like, "hey, baby, baby.

556
00:31:10,602 --> 00:31:12,469
Come here. Come here."

557
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,497
And so she walks back,
she's like, "what's wrong?"

558
00:31:14,505 --> 00:31:18,008
I was like, "don't get
in that pool.

559
00:31:29,921 --> 00:31:31,288
"Getting in that pool
is like swimming

560
00:31:31,356 --> 00:31:35,092
"in a bowl of dick soup.

561
00:31:43,434 --> 00:31:46,403
"You were out there backstroking
in a bowl of ball bouillabaisse.

562
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:47,015
Just..."

563
00:31:51,309 --> 00:31:53,310
I said, "you get in that pool,
nine months later,

564
00:31:53,378 --> 00:31:57,214
we sitting on Maury povich
trying to find a baby daddy."

565
00:32:14,532 --> 00:32:16,800
And they asked me
to do another one.

566
00:32:16,868 --> 00:32:18,936
I was like, "yeah,
I'll do another one.

567
00:32:19,003 --> 00:32:23,340
But this time,
we gonna have a dress code."

568
00:32:23,408 --> 00:32:25,008
Yeah, 'cause
that jock strap look

569
00:32:25,076 --> 00:32:27,678
wasn't working for everybody.

570
00:32:27,745 --> 00:32:29,012
They walking around,

571
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,016
all the little kibbles
and bits hanging out.

572
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:40,991
Oh, and they got real dodgy
around the breakfast buffet.

573
00:32:41,059 --> 00:32:45,128
I'm just going through the line
and they just walking through.

574
00:33:14,092 --> 00:33:15,826
"Uh, excuse me.

575
00:33:15,893 --> 00:33:20,297
Uh, can--can you get your dick
out my omelet, please?"

576
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:32,609
"You don't feel that?

577
00:33:35,079 --> 00:33:39,182
"Your dick
is in my omelet, man.

578
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:43,620
"No, I asked
for a Denver omelet,

579
00:33:43,688 --> 00:33:49,359
"not a man from Denver
with his dick in my omelet.

580
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:51,294
No, you keep that.
You keep that."

581
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:55,538
Big changes, man,
big changes.

582
00:33:55,566 --> 00:33:57,868
I'm a new mom,
a new mom.

583
00:33:58,903 --> 00:34:02,639
Yes.

584
00:34:02,707 --> 00:34:05,409
Wife had twins,
boy and a girl.

585
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:06,910
Yep.

586
00:34:06,978 --> 00:34:08,779
Very happy.

587
00:34:08,846 --> 00:34:11,481
You know, I know,
you know, in the past,

588
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,418
I've--you know, I've said
quite a few things about kids

589
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:17,254
and about
how they ruin your life

590
00:34:17,321 --> 00:34:19,022
and they're awful.

591
00:34:19,090 --> 00:34:22,726
And I was right.

592
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,562
I was right.

593
00:34:25,630 --> 00:34:28,165
They do ruin your life,
but they give a new life.

594
00:34:28,232 --> 00:34:29,952
That's the thing--
They give you a new life.

595
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:31,301
And I'm loving it.

596
00:34:31,369 --> 00:34:33,737
I'm loving every second
of it,

597
00:34:33,805 --> 00:34:35,338
loving every second of it.

598
00:34:35,406 --> 00:34:36,640
I think I started
a little late

599
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:38,442
'cause, you know, 45,

600
00:34:38,509 --> 00:34:41,178
so you know, started,
you know, kids, 45.

601
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:42,525
That's a little late
in the game.

602
00:34:42,547 --> 00:34:44,915
But it does--you know,
it does stick in my mind

603
00:34:44,982 --> 00:34:46,383
about the age thing.

604
00:34:46,451 --> 00:34:48,385
That's why I always,
like, talk to my kids a lot,

605
00:34:48,453 --> 00:34:49,719
just talk to them,
you know,

606
00:34:49,787 --> 00:34:51,521
and especially the boy, Lucas.

607
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:52,823
I talk to him all the time,

608
00:34:52,890 --> 00:34:54,791
especially when
I'm changing him, you know?

609
00:34:54,859 --> 00:34:56,560
And I'm like, "okay, Lucas,
you see,

610
00:34:56,627 --> 00:34:59,996
"you see how mommy has
the lights nice and low

611
00:35:00,064 --> 00:35:01,465
"and not too bright
in your eyes,

612
00:35:01,532 --> 00:35:03,567
"and that's your
little lullabies playing,

613
00:35:03,634 --> 00:35:04,668
"the music you like.

614
00:35:04,735 --> 00:35:06,069
"See? Uh-huh.

615
00:35:06,137 --> 00:35:08,405
Okay, now, not too tight
on your ankles, right?

616
00:35:08,473 --> 00:35:10,707
"Okay, let me get
them little towelette.

617
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:12,609
"And you see it's nice
and warm.

618
00:35:12,677 --> 00:35:13,910
"Yeah.

619
00:35:13,978 --> 00:35:15,679
"You like that, right?
Okay.

620
00:35:15,746 --> 00:35:18,982
"Now, you go from front
to back, okay?

621
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:21,251
"Clean to dirty.

622
00:35:21,319 --> 00:35:23,954
"Clean to dirty.

623
00:35:24,021 --> 00:35:26,656
"Clean to dirty.

624
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,725
"Now, look, I want you
to remember this

625
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:32,262
"so when you doing this
for mama, you do it right.

626
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:33,997
"Okay?

627
00:35:34,065 --> 00:35:38,368
Clean to dirty."

628
00:35:43,341 --> 00:35:45,108
The biggest thing
about being a new mom

629
00:35:45,176 --> 00:35:46,943
is that, you know,
with kids, that you're tired.

630
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,411
You're just tired all the time.

631
00:35:48,479 --> 00:35:49,646
I'm always tired.

632
00:35:49,714 --> 00:35:52,415
I'm tired now,
just tired, right?

633
00:35:52,483 --> 00:35:54,951
And I don't understand
how people cheat,

634
00:35:55,019 --> 00:35:56,953
you know, especially
when they have new kids

635
00:35:57,021 --> 00:35:58,722
and they cheat.

636
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:03,193
Where the fuck do you get
the energy to cheat?

637
00:36:03,261 --> 00:36:05,428
Shit, I told my wife,
I said, "look,

638
00:36:05,496 --> 00:36:08,198
"if you ever catch me
in another woman's bed,

639
00:36:08,266 --> 00:36:11,968
you know, I'm just there
for a nap."

640
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:20,944
I'll be like, "baby,
she had down pillows.

641
00:36:21,012 --> 00:36:24,047
I'm sorry."

642
00:36:30,288 --> 00:36:31,788
The kids are awesome, man.

643
00:36:31,856 --> 00:36:33,089
They are.

644
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,558
And, you know,
it's fun trying to--

645
00:36:34,625 --> 00:36:36,145
You know, when
you're figuring them out

646
00:36:36,160 --> 00:36:37,661
because they change every day.

647
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,362
There's always some change,
you know?

648
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:41,464
And, like, the boy,
Lucas,

649
00:36:41,532 --> 00:36:43,200
oh, boy, he is so simple.

650
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:45,468
And, guys, I don't mean
anything derogatory

651
00:36:45,536 --> 00:36:47,804
about that,
like guys are simple.

652
00:36:47,872 --> 00:36:50,974
But Lucas, when he cries,
it's because there's a reason.

653
00:36:51,042 --> 00:36:53,476
When Lucas cries,
maybe he's hungry.

654
00:36:53,544 --> 00:36:55,445
Lucas cries,
he's sleepy.

655
00:36:55,513 --> 00:36:57,447
Or if Lucas cries,
he needs his diaper changed.

656
00:36:57,515 --> 00:36:58,715
It's very simple.

657
00:36:58,783 --> 00:36:59,783
You get it.

658
00:36:59,850 --> 00:37:02,219
Olivia, I have no fucking idea

659
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:04,254
what is wrong with that girl.

660
00:37:04,322 --> 00:37:06,957
She can cry for any damn thing.

661
00:37:07,024 --> 00:37:08,391
Like, a leaf falls.

662
00:37:08,459 --> 00:37:10,293
"Ah!

663
00:37:10,361 --> 00:37:14,231
Ah!"

664
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:16,233
One night she was crying so bad,

665
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:17,867
my wife and I
couldn't figure it out.

666
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:19,569
We just thought
of rearranging furniture.

667
00:37:19,637 --> 00:37:22,472
"Maybe she wants
the sofa over here.

668
00:37:22,540 --> 00:37:25,342
"Put--just put
the damn sofa over here.

669
00:37:25,409 --> 00:37:27,143
"Okay, turn that lamp off.

670
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:29,112
"All right, okay,
yeah, open that shade.

671
00:37:29,180 --> 00:37:32,482
Do this."

672
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,918
Cries for any fucking thing.

673
00:37:34,986 --> 00:37:36,219
"Ah."

674
00:37:36,287 --> 00:37:37,387
"Close the refrigerator.

675
00:37:37,455 --> 00:37:38,421
"Olivia's crying.

676
00:37:38,489 --> 00:37:39,649
"Close the refrigerator door.

677
00:37:39,690 --> 00:37:43,827
Close the refrigerator door."

678
00:37:43,894 --> 00:37:45,829
Just crying for no reason.

679
00:37:45,896 --> 00:37:50,166
Just, "eh, eh."

680
00:37:50,234 --> 00:37:53,003
I was on a night shift,
so I had her one night, right?

681
00:37:53,070 --> 00:37:55,705
So she would just sit there
and she would not stop crying.

682
00:37:55,773 --> 00:37:57,574
I mean, I tried everything,

683
00:37:57,642 --> 00:38:00,844
and she just was,
"eh, eh,

684
00:38:00,911 --> 00:38:04,180
"eh, eh, ehhh!

685
00:38:04,248 --> 00:38:06,383
"Eh!

686
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:07,884
"Eh. Eh.

687
00:38:07,952 --> 00:38:10,754
Ehhh!"

688
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:16,259
"Eh!"

689
00:38:16,327 --> 00:38:18,728
After 45 minutes of that shit,
I was like,

690
00:38:18,796 --> 00:38:23,266
"what is your fucking problem?

691
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:25,268
"Olivia, sweetheart,
it's just baby.

692
00:38:25,336 --> 00:38:28,638
"You can't handle baby?

693
00:38:28,706 --> 00:38:34,544
Life is gonna kick your ass."

694
00:38:40,284 --> 00:38:41,985
She would not stop crying.

695
00:38:42,053 --> 00:38:44,154
And I said, "Wanda,
stop hollering at the baby.

696
00:38:44,221 --> 00:38:45,655
Don't talk to her like that."

697
00:38:45,723 --> 00:38:47,123
And I was like,
"Olivia, sweetheart,

698
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:49,626
"mommy is sorry, but look,
I don't know what to do.

699
00:38:49,694 --> 00:38:51,027
"I don't know what to do.

700
00:38:51,095 --> 00:38:53,630
I can't help you,
but I can help me."

701
00:38:53,698 --> 00:38:58,535
So I went over
and made a drink.

702
00:38:58,602 --> 00:39:00,870
I made myself a nice Martini.

703
00:39:00,938 --> 00:39:03,807
I was like, "mm-hmm."

704
00:39:03,874 --> 00:39:05,308
She was, "ah."

705
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:10,814
I was like, "yeah,
I know, I know.

706
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:12,615
"But you got
to bail out the banks, baby.

707
00:39:12,683 --> 00:39:14,584
You just got to do it."

708
00:39:14,652 --> 00:39:16,720
"Eh."

709
00:39:16,787 --> 00:39:18,822
"I don't know. I think
the redskins looking good.

710
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:20,957
I don't know."

711
00:39:21,025 --> 00:39:22,258
"Eh.

712
00:39:22,326 --> 00:39:23,259
Eh."

713
00:39:23,327 --> 00:39:24,260
"Oh, wait, wait, no.

714
00:39:24,328 --> 00:39:25,662
"You should see my 401k.

715
00:39:25,730 --> 00:39:26,663
Ooh."

716
00:39:26,731 --> 00:39:29,099
"Eh."

717
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:34,304
And my wife, she,
you know--

718
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,874
She's trying to set some rules
around the house, right?

719
00:39:37,942 --> 00:39:41,444
Yeah, she said the babies,
they're not allowed to watch TV.

720
00:39:41,512 --> 00:39:43,046
The babies are three months old.

721
00:39:43,114 --> 00:39:44,447
How the fuck--what the--

722
00:39:44,515 --> 00:39:45,982
It's just colors to them.

723
00:39:46,050 --> 00:39:48,284
They can't--they ain't
watching TV, you know?

724
00:39:48,352 --> 00:39:50,392
Well, I'm sitting there one day,
I'm feeding Olivia.

725
00:39:50,421 --> 00:39:51,955
You know, my wife comes--
The TV's on.

726
00:39:52,022 --> 00:39:54,022
She comes through,
she picks up the remote control,

727
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:55,024
turns the TV off.

728
00:39:55,092 --> 00:39:58,561
"Baby, come on.

729
00:40:03,434 --> 00:40:06,002
I go, "what do you mean
I can't watch TV?

730
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:07,470
"The baby not watching TV.

731
00:40:07,538 --> 00:40:09,973
"I'm watching TV.

732
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:11,541
Turn off my TV."

733
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:13,529
"Oh, baby, but TV,
it's not good, it's not good."

734
00:40:13,577 --> 00:40:14,911
I'm like, "wait a minute.

735
00:40:14,979 --> 00:40:18,381
TV paid for the TV."

736
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:28,291
"I think TV
is pretty fucking good.

737
00:40:28,359 --> 00:40:32,462
We should have about 50 tvs
in this motherfucker."

738
00:40:38,202 --> 00:40:41,104
My wife is French.
You know, she's French.

739
00:40:41,172 --> 00:40:42,305
I like to say she's French

740
00:40:42,373 --> 00:40:45,675
'cause it sounds nicer
than white.

741
00:40:59,156 --> 00:41:00,490
But, you know,
it's so funny.

742
00:41:00,558 --> 00:41:03,593
Like, as a, you know,
interracial couple,

743
00:41:03,661 --> 00:41:05,728
it's funny that
the only people that--

744
00:41:05,796 --> 00:41:07,836
You know, we haven't really
caught a lot of trouble,

745
00:41:07,865 --> 00:41:10,033
but the only group that's kind
of, like, been fucking with us,

746
00:41:10,100 --> 00:41:11,801
straight black women.

747
00:41:11,869 --> 00:41:14,237
Straight black women,
they give us grief.

748
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:15,425
And I'm like,
"what the fuck?

749
00:41:15,473 --> 00:41:17,707
"You're straight.
What the hell?

750
00:41:17,775 --> 00:41:22,312
It's not like you lost one."

751
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,386
But straight black women,
they still, you know,

752
00:41:30,454 --> 00:41:33,056
make eyes and give,
you know, my wife shit.

753
00:41:33,123 --> 00:41:34,924
I'm like,
"what are you thinking?"

754
00:41:34,992 --> 00:41:36,592
When you're straight,
what are you doing,

755
00:41:36,594 --> 00:41:38,228
going, "mm, look
at them white girls,

756
00:41:38,295 --> 00:41:42,465
"just taking all
our good black dykes.

757
00:41:47,938 --> 00:41:49,539
"Just can't keep
a good black dye.

758
00:41:49,607 --> 00:41:52,108
I tell you."

759
00:41:59,884 --> 00:42:02,485
And also our babies,
our babies, they're white.

760
00:42:02,553 --> 00:42:05,388
They're white, yeah, our
little white babies, you know?

761
00:42:05,456 --> 00:42:07,657
And, you know,
and people ask me,

762
00:42:07,725 --> 00:42:09,192
"why didn't you use
a black donor,

763
00:42:09,260 --> 00:42:10,927
"you know, so the babies
can look like y'all,

764
00:42:10,995 --> 00:42:12,262
you know, look like you?"

765
00:42:12,329 --> 00:42:13,897
I'm like, "what do you mean,
look like us?

766
00:42:13,964 --> 00:42:15,231
"The babies ain't gonna look
like us.

767
00:42:15,299 --> 00:42:19,168
"We're two women.

768
00:42:19,236 --> 00:42:23,606
We ain't fooling nobody."

769
00:42:32,149 --> 00:42:33,883
The fuck?

770
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,885
I would have slapped
the shit out of somebody

771
00:42:35,953 --> 00:42:39,556
if they walked up to us
and pointed at me and was like,

772
00:42:39,623 --> 00:42:44,193
"you must be the daddy."

773
00:42:44,261 --> 00:42:48,998
Get your dumb ass out of here.

774
00:42:49,066 --> 00:42:51,134
And, plus, you know,
we talked about it.

775
00:42:51,201 --> 00:42:53,269
We talked about it,
using a black donor.

776
00:42:53,337 --> 00:42:56,773
But, you know, I had
to really think this thing out.

777
00:42:56,840 --> 00:42:58,308
I had to think it out.

778
00:42:58,375 --> 00:43:01,244
And I was like, "hmm, I'm ten
years older than my wife,

779
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:03,446
"so you know, having a baby,
you know,

780
00:43:03,514 --> 00:43:05,381
maybe I'd be the first to go."

781
00:43:05,449 --> 00:43:07,083
And then I thought,
I said, "what if--

782
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:10,153
What if we have a little girl,
a little biracial girl?"

783
00:43:10,220 --> 00:43:12,822
I was like, "I can't leave
that girls hair

784
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:14,924
"up to this white lady.

785
00:43:14,992 --> 00:43:18,895
I can't do that to her."

786
00:43:18,963 --> 00:43:22,031
I couldn't keep--
I couldn't leave my baby's hair

787
00:43:22,099 --> 00:43:24,233
in this white lady's hands.

788
00:43:24,301 --> 00:43:28,671
She'd fuck her hair up.

789
00:43:28,739 --> 00:43:30,873
You ever seen
them biracial kids,

790
00:43:30,941 --> 00:43:34,711
and the white mother just has no
idea what to do with the hair,

791
00:43:34,778 --> 00:43:37,580
so they hair just all matted up,

792
00:43:37,648 --> 00:43:41,751
they never been combed,
and lint and car keys

793
00:43:41,819 --> 00:43:48,091
and q-tips all in they shit.

794
00:43:48,158 --> 00:43:50,326
Just find a black friend.

795
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:53,429
Do some...

796
00:43:53,497 --> 00:43:55,865
Take your child
to a black beauty parlor.

797
00:43:55,933 --> 00:43:57,700
Just fucking drive
through the hood

798
00:43:57,768 --> 00:43:59,088
and stick her head
out the window.

799
00:43:59,136 --> 00:44:01,537
Do something.

800
00:44:04,708 --> 00:44:05,908
Change.

801
00:44:05,976 --> 00:44:07,496
A lot of physical changes
are going on.

802
00:44:07,544 --> 00:44:08,945
You know, I never think
about age,

803
00:44:09,013 --> 00:44:11,848
but just think just some changes
happening to let you know

804
00:44:11,915 --> 00:44:14,851
that the age process
is happening.

805
00:44:14,918 --> 00:44:16,285
You know, like,
just little things.

806
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:19,956
Like, now when I say
I have to pee,

807
00:44:20,024 --> 00:44:24,260
I mean I have to pee.

808
00:44:31,168 --> 00:44:33,936
Before, you know, I used to
carry extra panties in my purse

809
00:44:34,004 --> 00:44:35,405
in case I got lucky.

810
00:44:35,472 --> 00:44:38,374
Now I carry them
in case I sneeze.

811
00:44:38,442 --> 00:44:40,209
What the hell?

812
00:44:52,956 --> 00:44:55,925
Look somebody just peed
on their selves right now.

813
00:45:03,701 --> 00:45:05,061
Oh, I'm sitting--
There's nothing--

814
00:45:05,102 --> 00:45:06,202
You just got to go.

815
00:45:06,270 --> 00:45:07,870
And I even asked my doctor
about it.

816
00:45:07,938 --> 00:45:09,305
I'm like, "look,
what is going on?"

817
00:45:09,373 --> 00:45:13,009
She said, "well, you need
to do more kegel exercises.

818
00:45:13,077 --> 00:45:15,712
"You need to exercise
your kegel muscles,

819
00:45:15,779 --> 00:45:18,247
"do those exercises,
you know, squeeze it,

820
00:45:18,315 --> 00:45:20,750
you know, tighten up,
uh, do that."

821
00:45:20,818 --> 00:45:22,118
I was like, "okay."

822
00:45:22,186 --> 00:45:24,721
I got home,
I did about 15 of them

823
00:45:24,788 --> 00:45:26,089
and caught a Charlie horse.

824
00:45:26,156 --> 00:45:27,557
I was like, "oh."

825
00:45:36,433 --> 00:45:38,201
Sweet Jesus, oh.

826
00:45:38,268 --> 00:45:40,436
Ah.

827
00:45:42,573 --> 00:45:45,408
It was like somebody
had shot me in my twat.

828
00:45:45,476 --> 00:45:49,112
I was like, "oh."

829
00:46:01,725 --> 00:46:06,462
And I'm gonna tell you,
you can't put icy hot on that.

830
00:46:11,135 --> 00:46:16,572
You can't.

831
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:20,576
Shit just happens, man.

832
00:46:23,013 --> 00:46:25,615
And then I try to work out,

833
00:46:25,682 --> 00:46:27,550
you know, try to stay
on top of stuff.

834
00:46:27,618 --> 00:46:30,319
But once you get
across that 40 mark,

835
00:46:30,387 --> 00:46:33,089
stuff just starts relaxing

836
00:46:33,157 --> 00:46:35,124
and just doing whatever
it wants to do.

837
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:38,060
Like this area right here,

838
00:46:38,128 --> 00:46:39,162
I just named it.

839
00:46:39,229 --> 00:46:41,798
This is Esther.

840
00:46:43,066 --> 00:46:46,435
Esther loves cheesecake,
loves cheesecake.

841
00:46:46,503 --> 00:46:49,872
"Ooh, I want some cheesecake."

842
00:46:49,940 --> 00:46:51,407
Loves cheesecake now.

843
00:46:51,475 --> 00:46:53,109
I'm on my way home,

844
00:46:53,177 --> 00:46:55,344
we go past a cheesecake factory.

845
00:46:55,412 --> 00:46:56,546
Esther takes the wheel.

846
00:46:56,613 --> 00:46:57,914
"Oh, give me some cheese."

847
00:46:57,981 --> 00:46:59,582
"Hey, Esther,
let go of the wheel, Esther."

848
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,950
"I want some cheesecake."

849
00:47:01,018 --> 00:47:04,387
"Shit.

850
00:47:04,454 --> 00:47:07,089
Gonna kill us, Esther."

851
00:47:12,162 --> 00:47:14,130
And I try to make deals
with her.

852
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:15,865
You know, I'm like,
"hey, look, Esther,

853
00:47:15,933 --> 00:47:19,035
"whenever I got to be
on camera, I'm on TV,"

854
00:47:19,102 --> 00:47:21,904
right, I said,
"I got to put you on the spanks.

855
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,172
I got to get you into spanks."

856
00:47:23,173 --> 00:47:25,174
Oh, she hates the spanks.

857
00:47:25,242 --> 00:47:27,610
Can't stand the spanks.

858
00:47:27,678 --> 00:47:30,038
You guys, all those guys out
there know what the spanks are?

859
00:47:30,080 --> 00:47:32,715
They're, like,
really, really tight pantyhose.

860
00:47:32,783 --> 00:47:36,018
They're short and they come
all the way up here.

861
00:47:36,086 --> 00:47:37,687
But they suck everything in.

862
00:47:37,754 --> 00:47:39,021
I got one on right now.

863
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:41,224
They suck everything in.

864
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:42,558
Yeah, I'm on TV.

865
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:44,460
Shit, yeah,
Esther's in the spanks.

866
00:47:44,528 --> 00:47:46,462
Fuck yeah.

867
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:51,734
Fuck.

868
00:47:51,802 --> 00:47:53,269
So I got to get Esther
into spanks.

869
00:47:53,337 --> 00:47:55,037
But guys,
they're real tight.

870
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:56,472
They're real--
You know, real--

871
00:47:56,540 --> 00:47:57,940
Okay, here--
Have y'all ever, like,

872
00:47:58,008 --> 00:48:00,109
been out with a girl
and you dancing with her

873
00:48:00,177 --> 00:48:01,644
and you doing this, right,

874
00:48:01,712 --> 00:48:03,479
you dancing like this,
holding her like this,

875
00:48:03,547 --> 00:48:07,550
and then when you get home,
you like that?

876
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,723
She had on her spanks.

877
00:48:13,790 --> 00:48:15,691
She turned into
an amoeba on your ass.

878
00:48:15,759 --> 00:48:19,328
You're like...

879
00:48:22,499 --> 00:48:24,367
That's what that was.

880
00:48:24,434 --> 00:48:27,570
So I was doing
<i>the tonight show,</i> right?

881
00:48:27,638 --> 00:48:30,406
So I was like, "Esther,
I'm doing <i>the tonight show.</i>

882
00:48:30,474 --> 00:48:32,008
I got to put you
into spanks."

883
00:48:32,075 --> 00:48:34,744
"Oh, I hate that spanks.

884
00:48:34,811 --> 00:48:36,746
"Oh, don't put me
in the spanks.

885
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:38,347
"I hate that spanks.

886
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:43,920
I want to be on TV."

887
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:51,861
"Esther, nobody wants
to see your fat ass on TV.

888
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:54,497
Now, get in the fucking spanks."

889
00:48:54,564 --> 00:48:56,132
I'm putting Esther
in the spanks

890
00:48:56,199 --> 00:48:57,600
and she's just fighting me.

891
00:48:57,668 --> 00:49:00,970
"Oh, ooh, ee, ooh,
you're killing me.

892
00:49:01,038 --> 00:49:02,505
"Oh, this hurts.

893
00:49:02,572 --> 00:49:04,340
"Oh, I want some cheesecake.

894
00:49:04,408 --> 00:49:07,376
Oh."

895
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:14,183
So I got Esther
into spanks, right?

896
00:49:14,251 --> 00:49:16,185
So I'm sitting,
you know, on <i>the tonight show,</i>

897
00:49:16,253 --> 00:49:17,987
doing my interview, right?

898
00:49:18,055 --> 00:49:20,723
Now, things are going great.

899
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,831
And all of a sudden,
in the middle of the interview,

900
00:49:22,859 --> 00:49:27,330
I feel something rolling down.

901
00:49:34,371 --> 00:49:36,138
And I could just hear,

902
00:49:36,206 --> 00:49:40,843
"hoo, hmm, ha, hoo."

903
00:49:40,911 --> 00:49:45,014
Esther is climbing out
of the spanks

904
00:49:45,082 --> 00:49:49,318
on national TV.

905
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:54,557
I look down.
There's Esther.

906
00:49:54,624 --> 00:49:59,161
"Hey, Jay."

907
00:50:05,769 --> 00:50:07,970
"Fuck you, Esther.

908
00:50:08,038 --> 00:50:10,539
White people are looking
at you."

909
00:50:13,210 --> 00:50:14,930
And men, Whoo,
you guys are catching hell.

910
00:50:14,945 --> 00:50:17,279
You probably not feeling
any better, right?

911
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:22,952
'Cause every other commercial
is for broke dick.

912
00:50:23,020 --> 00:50:25,654
Right?

913
00:50:25,722 --> 00:50:28,791
Broke dick, broke dick,
broke dick.

914
00:50:28,859 --> 00:50:31,527
Good grief,
every other commercial.

915
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:34,196
I'm so sick of that little
whistling man, that...

916
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:45,041
I say, "oh,
not broke dick Bob again.

917
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:49,211
I'm so sick of
that broke dick bastard."

918
00:50:53,150 --> 00:50:54,884
And guys, look.

919
00:50:54,951 --> 00:50:57,253
I'm not talking to the men
with prostate problems.

920
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:59,622
I'm just talking to the guys
that your dick just breaks.

921
00:50:59,689 --> 00:51:01,457
Maybe your dick just breaks
for a reason.

922
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:03,826
Maybe that's--maybe your dick
has run its course.

923
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:06,762
That's it.

924
00:51:06,830 --> 00:51:12,334
Maybe that's god's way of
telling you you all fucked out.

925
00:51:16,239 --> 00:51:18,207
Maybe the dick comes
with a punch card

926
00:51:18,275 --> 00:51:21,410
and y'all just didn't know
about it.

927
00:51:21,478 --> 00:51:23,512
Maybe if you start thinking
about it like that,

928
00:51:23,580 --> 00:51:25,881
you'll start being a little more
conservative with your dick,

929
00:51:25,949 --> 00:51:28,250
won't you?

930
00:51:28,318 --> 00:51:29,852
Be a little more conservative

931
00:51:29,920 --> 00:51:31,921
if you know you're limited
on your ammo.

932
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:38,060
Won't be out there just shooting
it off all Willy-nilly.

933
00:51:38,128 --> 00:51:43,399
You need to learn how to be more
sniper-like with your dick.

934
00:51:45,902 --> 00:51:48,938
I feel sorry for all these
little old ladies out there

935
00:51:49,005 --> 00:51:53,676
who been married
for, like, 50, 60 years.

936
00:51:53,743 --> 00:51:56,078
And you know that
these last two, three years,

937
00:51:56,146 --> 00:52:00,049
all they been doing is just
waiting for that dick to break,

938
00:52:00,117 --> 00:52:05,955
just waiting.

939
00:52:06,022 --> 00:52:08,557
They just been waiting
for that dick to die.

940
00:52:08,625 --> 00:52:10,025
They like, "I know,
okay, the dick,

941
00:52:10,093 --> 00:52:11,594
"it don't have much life
in it.

942
00:52:11,661 --> 00:52:13,496
"I know that dick.

943
00:52:13,563 --> 00:52:15,131
"That should be dead
pretty soon.

944
00:52:15,198 --> 00:52:17,933
"That dick gonna--
And then I can go do things,

945
00:52:18,001 --> 00:52:21,303
"do things I want to do
and go antiquing

946
00:52:21,371 --> 00:52:24,306
"and take my little bus trips
with my lady friends

947
00:52:24,374 --> 00:52:28,043
"and play the penny slots
for hours.

948
00:52:28,111 --> 00:52:31,247
"I can--i can clear out
that drawer in my nightstand,

949
00:52:31,314 --> 00:52:32,815
"get all those lubes
out of there

950
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:37,586
and put in
my crossword puzzles."

951
00:52:37,654 --> 00:52:39,221
They can't wait.

952
00:52:39,289 --> 00:52:40,856
Can't wait.

953
00:52:40,924 --> 00:52:43,092
Then one day
they get their wish.

954
00:52:43,160 --> 00:52:45,794
He tells her, "baby,
I think that party's over."

955
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:47,163
She comforts him.

956
00:52:47,230 --> 00:52:50,266
"It's okay, sweetheart.

957
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:51,734
"There's more to us than that.

958
00:52:51,801 --> 00:52:54,503
"We have a strong
companionship, love.

959
00:52:54,571 --> 00:52:56,472
"That's just not who we are.

960
00:52:56,540 --> 00:52:58,607
It's okay.
I love you. Mwah."

961
00:52:58,675 --> 00:53:01,177
Kiss his little forehead.

962
00:53:01,244 --> 00:53:03,245
Makes him feel better
about himself.

963
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:05,781
And as soon as he leaves
the house, she's like,

964
00:53:05,849 --> 00:53:08,851
"hallelujah,
the dick is dead."

965
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:11,687
And she does her little
"dick don't work no more" dance.

966
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:13,522
¶ The dick don't work no more

967
00:53:13,590 --> 00:53:15,691
¶ the dick don't work no more

968
00:53:15,759 --> 00:53:17,092
¶ the dick don't work no more

969
00:53:17,160 --> 00:53:19,595
¶ hallelujah,
the dick is dead ¶

970
00:53:19,663 --> 00:53:21,463
¶ dick is dead,
dick is dead ¶

971
00:53:21,531 --> 00:53:23,332
¶ ding-dong,
the dick is dead ¶

972
00:53:23,400 --> 00:53:25,267
¶ the dick is dead,
the dick is dead ¶

973
00:53:25,335 --> 00:53:29,972
¶ ding-dong,
the dickey dick is dead ¶

974
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:33,876
¶ hi-ho, hi-ho,
the dick don't work no mo' ¶

975
00:53:40,584 --> 00:53:42,418
she is loving it.

976
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:43,886
Loving it.

977
00:53:43,954 --> 00:53:48,424
And then he goes
and gets that pill.

978
00:53:48,491 --> 00:53:50,392
You ever seen
the little old ladies?

979
00:53:50,460 --> 00:53:52,795
You know, they're always,
like, looking down

980
00:53:52,862 --> 00:53:55,698
and just holding themselves.

981
00:53:55,765 --> 00:53:57,466
And they don't even get dressed.

982
00:53:57,534 --> 00:54:00,469
They just have
their house coat on.

983
00:54:04,608 --> 00:54:08,677
That's the lady
who's been tricked by science.

984
00:54:14,951 --> 00:54:17,286
"But I saw it.
The dick was dead.

985
00:54:17,354 --> 00:54:22,391
"I saw that...

986
00:54:22,459 --> 00:54:24,059
"The dick was dead, lord.

987
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:27,997
I don't--why me?
Why me?"

988
00:54:28,064 --> 00:54:30,699
That's who I feel sorry for.

989
00:54:30,767 --> 00:54:31,834
See, that's not right.

990
00:54:31,901 --> 00:54:32,901
It should be mutual.

991
00:54:32,969 --> 00:54:34,737
She should have some say,
right?

992
00:54:34,804 --> 00:54:37,406
So at least they should put
a age limit on it, right?

993
00:54:37,474 --> 00:54:38,474
They should.

994
00:54:38,541 --> 00:54:40,042
Like, if you over 78,

995
00:54:40,110 --> 00:54:41,977
the doctor shouldn't give you
that pill

996
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:43,646
unless you got a note
from three women

997
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:47,016
who want to fuck you.

998
00:54:55,592 --> 00:54:56,992
I changed some things.

999
00:54:57,060 --> 00:54:58,961
I tried--you know, I tried
to make some adjustments,

1000
00:54:59,029 --> 00:55:00,195
tried to change some things.

1001
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:03,599
You know, like,
I tried to get waxed.

1002
00:55:03,667 --> 00:55:06,101
Yeah, I tried waxing
for the first time.

1003
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:08,470
Yeah, and my friend,
she has a spa

1004
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:09,972
she runs out of her house.

1005
00:55:10,040 --> 00:55:11,340
And to support her,
I was like,

1006
00:55:11,408 --> 00:55:13,475
"ooh, I'm gonna get
the whole spa package."

1007
00:55:13,543 --> 00:55:16,145
You know, and part of it
was a bikini wax.

1008
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:18,180
Yeah, so I was like,
"I'll give it a shot,

1009
00:55:18,248 --> 00:55:19,315
I'll try it, you know?"

1010
00:55:19,382 --> 00:55:20,702
And she told me,
she said, "Wanda,

1011
00:55:20,717 --> 00:55:22,051
it's gonna hurt a little bit."

1012
00:55:22,118 --> 00:55:23,752
And I was like,
"I'm tough.

1013
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:27,723
I got that shit."

1014
00:55:27,791 --> 00:55:31,427
So she put the wax on there
and put the tape on there and...

1015
00:55:31,494 --> 00:55:32,561
Foomp.

1016
00:55:32,629 --> 00:55:35,831
I smacked the shit
out of her.

1017
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:37,399
You hear me?

1018
00:55:37,467 --> 00:55:39,068
You hear me?

1019
00:55:39,135 --> 00:55:40,302
Phew. Pff!

1020
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:44,206
"What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1021
00:55:44,274 --> 00:55:47,343
"Shit.

1022
00:55:47,410 --> 00:55:48,677
"Is this what you do?

1023
00:55:48,745 --> 00:55:49,905
"You just sit up
in your house

1024
00:55:49,946 --> 00:55:52,848
"and snatch hair
off of people all day?

1025
00:55:52,916 --> 00:55:59,054
This is some sick shit."

1026
00:55:59,122 --> 00:56:00,889
And then she starts smacking it.

1027
00:56:00,957 --> 00:56:02,758
I'm like, "ow, ow.

1028
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:04,186
Ow, bitch, ow.
What are you doing?"

1029
00:56:04,194 --> 00:56:06,161
She's like, "oh,
that takes the sting away."

1030
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:10,499
I said, "no,
that fucking hurts.

1031
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:12,401
"How would you like it
if I stabbed you

1032
00:56:12,469 --> 00:56:14,002
"and then stuck my finger
in the hole?

1033
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:16,338
"Ooh.

1034
00:56:16,406 --> 00:56:19,274
"Don't that feel better?

1035
00:56:19,342 --> 00:56:24,747
Soothing, huh?"

1036
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:28,884
Ooh, I was mad.

1037
00:56:28,952 --> 00:56:30,419
And then I was bad

1038
00:56:30,487 --> 00:56:32,855
'cause I had
to let her finish, you know?

1039
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:35,824
I had to let her--
Get her to even that shit out.

1040
00:56:35,892 --> 00:56:37,526
I couldn't have, like,
one side waxed

1041
00:56:37,594 --> 00:56:38,761
and one side razored.

1042
00:56:38,828 --> 00:56:40,963
That shit don't match.

1043
00:56:41,030 --> 00:56:43,198
It would have felt like somebody
else was in my pants.

1044
00:56:43,266 --> 00:56:47,436
You know, like...

1045
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:56,412
Mm.

1046
00:56:56,479 --> 00:56:59,782
Well, how you doing?

1047
00:57:03,553 --> 00:57:04,686
Whoo, that hurt.

1048
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:05,888
Boy.

1049
00:57:05,955 --> 00:57:07,656
And then ti got worse

1050
00:57:07,724 --> 00:57:09,191
'cause I thought
she was finished,

1051
00:57:09,259 --> 00:57:12,594
and then she goes,
"okay, now, turn over."

1052
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:14,363
Yeah.
I was like, "excuse me?"

1053
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,532
She said, "turn over;
I got to get the back side.

1054
00:57:16,599 --> 00:57:17,633
I got to get your butt."

1055
00:57:17,700 --> 00:57:18,867
I was like, "my butt?"

1056
00:57:18,935 --> 00:57:23,338
I said, "oh,
that won't be necessary.

1057
00:57:23,406 --> 00:57:29,745
"Nothing goes on back there.

1058
00:57:36,119 --> 00:57:37,920
"Besides, I like it
to look like that

1059
00:57:37,987 --> 00:57:41,990
"'cause it scares people away.

1060
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:49,665
"You know, make them think I got
a dog chained up back there

1061
00:57:49,732 --> 00:57:52,234
"or something.

1062
00:57:52,302 --> 00:57:54,870
"If they get close,
I even growl a little bit.

1063
00:57:54,938 --> 00:57:55,438
Grrr."

1064
00:58:01,010 --> 00:58:02,978
She was like, "roll over, fool,
come on, come on."

1065
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:04,526
She's like,
"it won't hurt that much."

1066
00:58:04,581 --> 00:58:05,681
I'm like, "well,
what the fuck?

1067
00:58:05,748 --> 00:58:06,949
"All right.

1068
00:58:07,016 --> 00:58:08,684
A little change.
Why not?"

1069
00:58:08,751 --> 00:58:11,520
So I turned over,
and she put the wax in there

1070
00:58:11,588 --> 00:58:13,689
and then put the tape in there.

1071
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:15,424
Whoomf.

1072
00:58:15,492 --> 00:58:19,862
Everything went white.

1073
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:30,339
And a little bit
of pee came out.

1074
00:58:30,406 --> 00:58:34,142
A little bit of pee
came out too.

1075
00:58:40,783 --> 00:58:44,953
And I passed out.

1076
00:58:45,021 --> 00:58:46,955
But I wasn't out long,
I wasn't out long,

1077
00:58:47,023 --> 00:58:48,323
'cause when I woke up,

1078
00:58:48,391 --> 00:58:50,231
she was still standing there
holding the thing.

1079
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,227
And she goes,
"are you okay, Wanda?"

1080
00:58:52,295 --> 00:58:56,732
I was like, "uh...

1081
00:58:56,799 --> 00:59:01,603
"I, uh...

1082
00:59:01,671 --> 00:59:05,107
"I--i think you
just ripped out my ass hole.

1083
00:59:13,716 --> 00:59:17,219
"Yep, you have ripped out
my ass hole.

1084
00:59:17,287 --> 00:59:21,089
"Why would you do that?

1085
00:59:21,157 --> 00:59:22,991
"Don't throw that one.
Give me that back.

1086
00:59:23,059 --> 00:59:25,894
"I need that one back.

1087
00:59:25,962 --> 00:59:29,364
Some sick shit."

1088
00:59:29,432 --> 00:59:32,534
I have never felt pain
like that before.

1089
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:36,204
That kind of pain should happen
out in the wild somewhere.

1090
00:59:36,272 --> 00:59:38,507
I'm serious. It shouldn't be
happening to humans.

1091
00:59:38,575 --> 00:59:40,642
You know, you watch
those nature shows,

1092
00:59:40,710 --> 00:59:44,813
and you see the lion
stalking the wildebeest.

1093
00:59:44,881 --> 00:59:46,615
And when he makes
that initial bite,

1094
00:59:46,683 --> 00:59:48,016
it looks so painful.

1095
00:59:48,084 --> 00:59:49,484
That's what it felt like.

1096
00:59:49,552 --> 00:59:53,789
I pictured my ass hole
running across the serengeti.

1097
00:59:53,856 --> 00:59:55,591
And I was like,
"run, ass hole.

1098
00:59:55,658 --> 00:59:57,259
"Run, ass hole, run!

1099
00:59:57,327 --> 00:59:58,427
"Come on, ass hole!

1100
00:59:58,494 --> 00:59:59,561
"Run, ass hole!

1101
00:59:59,629 --> 01:00:00,129
Ah!"

1102
01:00:04,934 --> 01:00:08,370
Hot lion teeth in my ass hole.

1103
01:00:08,438 --> 01:00:10,439
That's what it felt like.

1104
01:00:10,506 --> 01:00:12,541
Shit, I got a tetanus shot
when I left there.

1105
01:00:12,609 --> 01:00:14,576
I'm telling you.

1106
01:00:20,049 --> 01:00:21,850
So I'm getting
my stuff together,

1107
01:00:21,918 --> 01:00:23,585
you know, getting ready
to leave,

1108
01:00:23,653 --> 01:00:25,354
and I'm getting dressed,
and she goes,

1109
01:00:25,421 --> 01:00:26,989
"wait a minute,
you're not finished."

1110
01:00:27,056 --> 01:00:29,124
I'm like, "what?"

1111
01:00:29,192 --> 01:00:32,094
And she goes, "uh,
I have to do your facial."

1112
01:00:32,161 --> 01:00:34,262
I was like, "my facial?

1113
01:00:34,330 --> 01:00:38,333
"Not after you've been digging
around in my ass.

1114
01:00:43,506 --> 01:00:47,909
"I don't want your assy hands
touching my face.

1115
01:00:50,380 --> 01:00:54,816
"You don't go ass to face.

1116
01:00:54,884 --> 01:00:59,354
You go clean to dirty."

1117
01:01:10,800 --> 01:01:12,501
You know, sometimes,
you know,

1118
01:01:12,568 --> 01:01:15,404
as much as you try
to fight the whole change

1119
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:19,074
and aging process,
sometimes things happen

1120
01:01:19,142 --> 01:01:21,109
that just so strong
in your face,

1121
01:01:21,177 --> 01:01:23,111
just smacks you dead
in your face,

1122
01:01:23,179 --> 01:01:26,314
that you just have
to go, "okay, it is what it is."

1123
01:01:26,382 --> 01:01:27,549
This is a true story.

1124
01:01:27,617 --> 01:01:28,750
I'm coming out
of the mall, right,

1125
01:01:28,818 --> 01:01:30,052
walking out of the mall,

1126
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:31,599
and I'm just digging
through my purse,

1127
01:01:31,621 --> 01:01:33,288
just rifling through my bag

1128
01:01:33,356 --> 01:01:35,290
and, you know, I'm talking
to my friend,

1129
01:01:35,358 --> 01:01:37,592
and she could tell
that I was distracted.

1130
01:01:37,660 --> 01:01:39,928
She was like, "Wanda,
are you listening to me?"

1131
01:01:39,996 --> 01:01:41,663
I was like, "girl,
I'm sorry,

1132
01:01:41,731 --> 01:01:45,634
but I think I left
my cell phone in the store."

1133
01:02:03,753 --> 01:02:05,454
And she goes,
"okay, well,

1134
01:02:05,521 --> 01:02:09,725
call me back when you find it."

1135
01:02:09,792 --> 01:02:11,560
Damn.

1136
01:02:11,627 --> 01:02:13,328
Thank you, D.C.
I love y'all.
