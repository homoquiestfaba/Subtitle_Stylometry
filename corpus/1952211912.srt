to withhold comment

pending further investigation.

00:00:32,029 --> 00:00:33,897
Officials at NASA
released a joint statement

with the National Weather Service
this afternoon

00:00:36,067 --> 00:00:39,035

being called a celestial event

part of the country.

No details are available
at the present time,

that the atmosphere

extreme weather systems

Yeah, Angel's talented.

Did you see her
in "Wick Dipper V"?

00:01:11,435 --> 00:01:12,869
I don't think so.

in that.

That's nice.

Kind of cozy, huh?

Stubble always hurts
when I'm getting my pussy eaten.

166

So I spray it on
right before a scene.

that's using your noodle.

of your own tricks of the trade.

170
00:08:20,263 --> 00:08:22,865
Yeah.
I've got a great one.

171

I hit myself in the head
with a piece of wood

five times really hard
right there.

175
00:08:32,509 --> 00:08:34,544
What does that do?

176
00:08:34,611 --> 00:08:38,448
It disables
the olfactory bulb

177
00:08:38,515 --> 00:08:40,550
in my limbic system.

178
00:08:40,617 --> 00:08:44,054
I can't smell anything
for 12 straight hours.

179
00:08:44,121 --> 00:08:45,154
Mm-hmm.

So I ask the director
to make sure

181
00:08:47,058 --> 00:08:50,226
all my ass-licking scenes
are in the same day.

182
00:08:50,294 --> 00:08:51,727
Cool.

183
00:08:51,795 --> 00:08:52,728
It works.

Hey. Hey.

Okay,
what's the matter?

Been put out to pasture, Ron.

What are you talking about?

192
00:09:15,086 --> 00:09:16,452
I never should have come here.

193
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:18,288
I mean, I don't know
what I was thinking.

194
00:09:18,355 --> 00:09:21,257
I guess I was hoping maybe
I could fill in for somebody,

195
00:09:21,325 --> 00:09:25,995
or maybe they'd add a scene
just because...

196
00:09:26,062 --> 00:09:27,497
Because I was here.

00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:31,767
Pretty deluded, huh?

[ sighs ]

201
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:38,441
I'm the worst kind of diva --

202
00:09:38,509 --> 00:09:40,510
an out-of-work one.

203
00:09:40,577 --> 00:09:42,978
Truth is, I don't belong
in hard-core anymore.

204
00:09:43,046 --> 00:09:45,281
You know, there's no room
for a woman my age.

205
00:09:45,349 --> 00:09:48,283
Do you remember the first film
we ever did together?

206
00:09:48,351 --> 00:09:51,286
Um...

207
00:09:51,354 --> 00:09:55,558
"Women in Love," 1979.

208
00:09:55,626 --> 00:09:57,259
I played your fiancée.

209
00:09:57,327 --> 00:09:58,394
Right.

210
00:09:58,462 --> 00:10:00,697
28 years later,
I'm here to tell you

211
00:10:00,764 --> 00:10:02,865
that the years have made you
only more beautiful.

212
00:10:02,933 --> 00:10:04,233
Right.

213
00:10:04,301 --> 00:10:06,736
What you're lacking
is confidence,

214
00:10:06,803 --> 00:10:08,137
and that is a shame.

215
00:10:08,204 --> 00:10:10,440
Ronny, do you know how tough
it is to be confident

216
00:10:10,507 --> 00:10:13,075
when half the girls on the set
call you mom?

217
00:10:13,144 --> 00:10:14,076
That shouldn't matter.

218
00:10:14,145 --> 00:10:15,978
How you feel --
that's what matters.

219
00:10:16,046 --> 00:10:17,179
Look at me.

220
00:10:17,247 --> 00:10:20,950
I don't look like a porn star,
except for my...cock.

221
00:10:21,017 --> 00:10:23,185
But I play the fool,
and I get the joke.

222
00:10:23,253 --> 00:10:24,287
I'm in on it.

223
00:10:24,355 --> 00:10:25,955
And that makes it kind of hip.

224
00:10:26,022 --> 00:10:28,791
And I try to bring a
different character into
every role that I play,

225
00:10:28,859 --> 00:10:31,360
And that gives me confidence.

226
00:10:31,428 --> 00:10:34,230
But I can't suck
my own dick anymore.

227
00:10:34,298 --> 00:10:36,666
Oh, sweetie, I'm sorry.

and the back pains,

Let me tell you something,
Veronica.

233
00:10:51,715 --> 00:10:53,316
You have
something really special

234
00:10:53,384 --> 00:10:56,452
that I have found
very hard to resist.

235
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:58,954
Thanks, Ronny.

236
00:10:59,022 --> 00:11:01,924
You know, I do wish
Jim would put me in the movie.

I think I've got
a few surprises left.

What are you waiting for?

Why don't you go talk to him?

240
00:11:08,231 --> 00:11:12,101
I guess maybe
he just needs to be persuaded.

241
00:11:12,168 --> 00:11:14,537
Maybe he needs
your secret weapon.

242
00:11:14,605 --> 00:11:17,373
Maybe I'll show him.

243
00:11:17,441 --> 00:11:18,373

Remember,
you are a porn star.

are made of.

Shouldn't you be running lines
with Wanda or something?

She knows her lines.
I know her lines.

Don't start with me, Veronica.
We've been through this.

Yeah, I know.
We've talked and talked.

is getting us anywhere.

all of which is available
on the internet,

to send the information
to that thing,

and an adjustable aperture.

Okay, okay.
Keep your panties on.

570
00:28:20,229 --> 00:28:22,631
You're saying
a disembodied dick did this?

571
00:28:22,698 --> 00:28:24,966
Do you think
I'd make that up?

572
00:28:25,034 --> 00:28:26,802
What should we do?

573
00:28:33,208 --> 00:28:35,309
We got to do something
with this body.

574
00:28:35,377 --> 00:28:37,178
There's a dumpster out back.

575
00:28:37,246 --> 00:28:39,347
He's a human being,
not a fucking pizza box.

576
00:28:39,415 --> 00:28:40,582
We could pack him in the snow

577
00:28:40,650 --> 00:28:42,317
Until we can get an ambulance
up here.

578
00:28:42,385 --> 00:28:44,486
Now, how do you propose
we do that?

579
00:28:44,554 --> 00:28:46,087
There are no phone lines
up here,

580
00:28:46,155 --> 00:28:48,189
And my cell
doesn't get a signal.

It doesn't matter.

I know you're gonna think
I'm crazy.

I just saw a disembodied dick
in Angel's mouth.

Maybe it talks, too.

You know, when I went to
the truck to get those filters,

699
00:35:06,068 --> 00:35:07,435
I saw something in the sky.

700
00:35:07,502 --> 00:35:08,870
Ron saw it, too.

701
00:35:08,938 --> 00:35:10,438
It's almost like
a shooting star.

702
00:35:10,505 --> 00:35:13,975
And I saw a really bright light
just outside that door.

703
00:35:14,043 --> 00:35:15,276
I could see it from my cabin,

704
00:35:15,344 --> 00:35:16,711
but I just thought
it was one of yours.

705
00:35:16,779 --> 00:35:17,979
I don't have lights
that bright.

706
00:35:18,047 --> 00:35:19,613
What did Ron say about it?

707
00:35:19,681 --> 00:35:21,815
Nothing, but
he was acting kind of strange

708
00:35:21,883 --> 00:35:23,584
when I got back from the truck.

709
00:35:23,652 --> 00:35:24,585
Why?

710
00:35:24,653 --> 00:35:27,021
Maybe nothing.

711
00:35:27,089 --> 00:35:28,089
Maybe everything.

712
00:35:29,891 --> 00:35:32,060
I have a theory.

713
00:35:32,128 --> 00:35:33,694
It's a little way-out.

714
00:35:33,763 --> 00:35:35,864
But I saw a dick scurry
out of a tail pipe today,

715
00:35:35,931 --> 00:35:38,032
so I'm willing to consider
just about everything.

716
00:35:38,100 --> 00:35:39,167
Well, go on.

717
00:35:39,234 --> 00:35:43,237
The shooting star,
the bright light,

718
00:35:43,305 --> 00:35:45,907
Ron acts weird,
and his dick takes off running.

719
00:35:45,975 --> 00:35:47,608
And killing.

720
00:35:47,676 --> 00:35:48,643
Mm.

721
00:35:48,711 --> 00:35:51,079
Yes, I haven't forgotten that.
And killing.

722
00:35:51,146 --> 00:35:53,948
What if that shooting star

723
00:35:54,016 --> 00:35:59,153
was some alien life-form
that invaded Ron

724
00:35:59,221 --> 00:36:00,588
and took control of his dick?

725
00:36:00,655 --> 00:36:02,157
Give me a fucking break!

726
00:36:02,224 --> 00:36:05,226
I don't know.
I'm just riffing here.

727
00:36:05,294 --> 00:36:07,461
But it seems to be only natural

728
00:36:07,529 --> 00:36:10,764
that if an alien
wanted to take over the planet,

729
00:36:10,832 --> 00:36:13,268
it would need to seed it.

730
00:36:13,335 --> 00:36:14,803
A dick.

731
00:36:14,870 --> 00:36:16,604
Well, not just any dick.

732
00:36:16,672 --> 00:36:19,507
One that had access to
as many vaginas as possible

733
00:36:19,574 --> 00:36:21,675
and could penetrate them
as deeply

734
00:36:21,743 --> 00:36:23,944
as someone like Ron could.

735
00:36:24,013 --> 00:36:26,747
Maybe it even knows who's
capable of conceiving right now

736
00:36:26,815 --> 00:36:28,716
and sees anyone who isn't
as a threat.

737
00:36:28,783 --> 00:36:30,051
So, you're saying
it scouted Ron?

738
00:36:30,119 --> 00:36:31,852
I don't know.
I'm tired.

739
00:36:31,921 --> 00:36:34,289
But maybe it did.

740
00:36:34,356 --> 00:36:36,891
Hey, Mr. "X files,"
why just the dick?

741
00:36:36,959 --> 00:36:38,326
Why not all of Ron?

742
00:36:38,393 --> 00:36:41,062
Women don't usually fuck dicks
that aren't attached to men.

743
00:36:41,130 --> 00:36:42,396
Unless
they're battery-operated.

744
00:36:42,464 --> 00:36:45,133
I don't really think it's
interested in wooing anybody.

745
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,868
It just wants to replicate.

746
00:36:46,936 --> 00:36:49,370
And it clearly doesn't mind
using force.

747
00:36:49,438 --> 00:36:53,241
To the alien, everything
but the dick is baggage.

748
00:36:53,308 --> 00:36:54,843
We got to kill it.

749
00:36:54,910 --> 00:36:56,177
No.

750
00:36:58,280 --> 00:37:02,816
I just mean...Can't we trap it
or something?

751
00:37:02,884 --> 00:37:04,752
Maybe it's just scared.

752
00:37:04,819 --> 00:37:07,989
You didn't see
what that thing did to Angel.

753
00:37:08,057 --> 00:37:10,024
It was horrible.

754
00:37:10,092 --> 00:37:12,393
So, how are we gonna do it?

755
00:37:12,461 --> 00:37:14,628
MOHTZ:
I'll kill it for you.

756
00:37:19,068 --> 00:37:21,569
It's a death machine...

757
00:37:21,636 --> 00:37:23,304
Smart.

758
00:37:23,372 --> 00:37:26,407
You've got to outthink it.

759
00:37:26,475 --> 00:37:29,010
Never saw one that big, though.

760
00:37:29,078 --> 00:37:30,845
You've seen them before?

761
00:37:30,913 --> 00:37:33,848
One.

762
00:37:33,916 --> 00:37:37,451
Well, care to elaborate,
old-timer?

763
00:37:39,088 --> 00:37:40,454
No.

764
00:37:40,522 --> 00:37:42,023
Then what the hell
are you doing here?

765
00:37:42,091 --> 00:37:46,960
I saw that streak of light
from my cabin on the other side.

766
00:37:47,028 --> 00:37:48,896
The shooting star.

767
00:37:48,963 --> 00:37:51,565
You can call it
whatever you want to, but...

768
00:37:54,069 --> 00:37:55,870
...that's not what it is.

769
00:37:55,938 --> 00:37:57,405
What are we doing
listening to this guy?

770
00:37:57,472 --> 00:37:59,473
He probably thinks he's
in the jungle, for christ sakes.

771
00:37:59,541 --> 00:38:01,376
Why don't you just shut up?

772
00:38:01,443 --> 00:38:02,910
So, you know what it was?

773
00:38:05,647 --> 00:38:07,248
Your man there already knows.

774
00:38:07,316 --> 00:38:09,650
So it's a martian?

775
00:38:09,718 --> 00:38:13,587
Sweetheart, I don't have
its mailing address or anything,

776
00:38:13,655 --> 00:38:16,124
but I can tell you one thing --

777
00:38:16,191 --> 00:38:20,428
it's not
from this godforsaken planet.

778
00:38:20,495 --> 00:38:22,030
You said
you know how to kill it.

779
00:38:22,097 --> 00:38:23,164
How?

780
00:38:23,232 --> 00:38:28,036
Whatever it was,
whatever it's gonna be,

781
00:38:28,103 --> 00:38:31,239
right now it's a dick.

782
00:38:31,306 --> 00:38:33,975
Brilliant.

783
00:38:34,043 --> 00:38:38,346
And, therefore, subject
to the physiology of one.

784
00:38:38,413 --> 00:38:41,315
Bright boy.

785
00:38:41,383 --> 00:38:42,316
Oh.

786
00:38:42,384 --> 00:38:45,719
Of course.
Of course.

787
00:38:45,787 --> 00:38:48,856
It seems to kill
during an act of penetration,

788
00:38:48,923 --> 00:38:50,424
meaning it's erect.

789
00:38:50,492 --> 00:38:54,562
But, okay --
but what about after that?

790
00:38:54,630 --> 00:38:57,966
If it's a dick, it needs
a refractory period, right?

791
00:38:58,033 --> 00:38:59,033
So, what?

792
00:38:59,101 --> 00:39:01,669
So that's when it's spent.

793
00:39:01,737 --> 00:39:03,437
That's when it's vulnerable.

794
00:39:03,505 --> 00:39:06,274
I just call it a rest period.

795
00:39:06,341 --> 00:39:09,843
So, we just need to get it
to blow its load.

796
00:39:09,911 --> 00:39:11,179
But then what?

797
00:39:11,247 --> 00:39:14,782
Circumcise it to oblivion

798
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:17,218
with an ax.

799
00:39:17,286 --> 00:39:19,620
Should have one in your shed.

800
00:39:19,688 --> 00:39:21,155
How are we gonna get it
to come?

801
00:39:21,223 --> 00:39:22,656
She's a porn star.
She can fuck it.

802
00:39:22,724 --> 00:39:23,824
Hey!
- Fuck you!

803
00:39:23,892 --> 00:39:25,426
No one's fucking it.

804
00:39:25,494 --> 00:39:28,796
At least no one human.

805

Come again.

806
00:39:30,099 --> 00:39:32,566
I'll set up
the neuro-tactile simulator.

807

00:39:34,636 --> 00:39:36,104
We'll explain later.

810
00:39:36,171 --> 00:39:38,306
Right now
we need to get that ax.

811
00:39:38,373 --> 00:39:41,476
Someone has to go to the shed
and get it.

812

813
00:39:55,591 --> 00:39:58,592
There's only four.
What about him?

814
00:39:58,660 --> 00:40:00,428
The man's frostbitten.

815
00:40:00,496 --> 00:40:02,730
And he volunteered to kill it.

I very cautiously,

00:53:24,132 --> 00:53:27,301
crept into the tent to get
a radio to get some air support,

it's looking back at me.

But it looked, you know,
fucking weak, man.

And it was like in this,

you call it?

00:53:48,823 --> 00:53:51,058
And, you know, I could have
killed it right then,

1042
00:53:51,126 --> 00:53:53,961
but I was so stoned
I was afraid I'd miss.

1043
00:53:54,028 --> 00:53:57,364
And on the other hand, I knew
it was just a matter of time

1044
00:53:57,431 --> 00:54:00,901
before it would be, you know,
back in action again.

1045
00:54:00,969 --> 00:54:04,805

off of it,

00:54:04,873 --> 00:54:09,576

I'm holding my weapon
on this dick.

1049
00:54:15,616 --> 00:54:18,451
Now, I figured
it won't know I'm stoned,

1050
00:54:18,519 --> 00:54:21,121
so he won't jump me,
you know.

1051
00:54:21,189 --> 00:54:24,324
So, chopper arrived
just in time, thank God,

1052
00:54:24,392 --> 00:54:28,929
Because now the dick
was getting big and hard.

1053
00:54:28,997 --> 00:54:32,665
So I tell the two whores, "look,
hey, I'll do anything, man.

00:54:32,733 --> 00:54:34,467
"I take you to the states,

if you just lie down there
and spread your legs for me."

1056
00:54:37,738 --> 00:54:39,506
Well I guess "States"
was the magic word,

1057
00:54:39,574 --> 00:54:41,008
because you never saw

so quick in your life.

1059

must have smelled dinner

a beeline for the whores.

1062
00:54:50,852 --> 00:54:52,886
So, I watch.

1063
00:54:52,954 --> 00:54:54,754
And I wait.
And I watch.

1064
00:54:54,823 --> 00:54:57,024
Finally...finally, man,
it blew its load.

1065
00:54:57,091 --> 00:54:58,491
I grabbed it,
and I went outside,

1066
00:54:58,559 --> 00:54:59,826
