- And so we decided it was time
to go to the authorities.

176
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:13,703
- We obtained
the suspected tea sample

177
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:16,534
collected by the paramedics
themselves.

178
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:19,397
And I took it to
the state crime lab,

179
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:22,073
and then they come back
and confirm that

180
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,430
actually that tea sample
had contained arsenic.

181
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:29,627
I looked up the symptoms
of arsenic poisoning,

182
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:32,097
and that was consistent
with the reports

183
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:36,003
from the paramedics of them
becoming violently ill.

184
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:39,103
And I confirmed that
the major ingredient

185
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:42,203
in Terro Ant Poison is arsenic.

186
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:43,573
- Also during
the investigation,

187
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,170
they took samples
of my fingernail,

188
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,100
they took samples of my hair,

189
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:51,433
and they found high levels of
arsenic in my hair samples.

190
00:08:51,467 --> 00:08:54,197
So at this point in time,
Mike was still working

191
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:57,173
as a paramedic there
at Blessing Hospital.

192
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,000
So I'm not accepting any food
or beverage from Mike

193
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:05,673
because I do think
he's a dangerous person.

194
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,530
[soft dramatic music]

195
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:10,727
The assistant state's attorney
met with us

196
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:12,667
and said that I think
we have enough evidence

197
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,000
that we can go forth
with trial

198
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:18,233
and we can go with
assault charges.

199
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,696
I wish we had enough evidence

200
00:09:19,734 --> 00:09:22,234
to charge him with
attempted murder.

201
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:25,996
- We can prove that he had
placed some kind of poison

202
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,673
on the food products
or in the drinks,

203
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,670
but we could not
necessarily prove

204
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,100
that he wanted to kill anybody.

205
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:37,703
So I was able to obtain

206
00:09:37,734 --> 00:09:39,634
an arrest warrant
for Michael Swango

207
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:41,567
for aggravated battery.

208
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,770
After I arrested him,
he made bond and he's out,

209
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,500
and then a trial date is set.

210
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:50,633
- So I hear that Mike
is out free.

211
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:52,767
I'm nervous as heck

212
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,170
because I know what
he's capable of doing.

213
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,230
Is he mad at us to the point
where he's gonna come at us?

214
00:09:58,266 --> 00:10:00,726
- And we couldn't take
the change with this guy

215
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,527
running loose in our community.

216
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:05,627
We didn't know what he was
gonna do next.

217
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:07,497
So we obtained
a search warrant

218
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:10,173
in order to get more evidence,

219
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,200
and make a beeline
for his apartment.

220
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:18,073
As we walked in
Mr. Swango's apartment,

221
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,170
I got a sense that
I was in an evil place.

222
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,700
I was in the presence of evil.

223
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:26,704
[dramatic music]

224
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:28,574
- Coming up...

225
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,100
- My father would tell us
that there was a doctor

226
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:33,733
that came by and would point
at him and tell him,

227
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,597
"You're next."

228
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:37,173
- He injects
the pregnant woman.

229
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,730
She immediately starts going
into convulsions.

230
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,997
- The killer had been
in there minutes

231
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:45,103
wreaking havoc on the hospital.

232
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:47,173
- At this point,
it was a manhunt.

233
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,100
We're very aware that
the clock is running.

234
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:52,733
- Anybody that has this
sort of compulsion to kill

235
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:54,067
if you don't catch
them right away,

236
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,670
they're gonna continue killing.

237
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:01,127
- When Michael Swango

238
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:01,433
- When Michael Swango
was charged with

239
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,296
aggravated battery
for poisoning

240
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,133
his fellow paramedics,

241
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,566
investigators secured a warrant
to search his apartment.

242
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,630
They were looking for evidence
to support their allegations,

243
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:14,097
but what they found was
nothing short

244
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:16,573
of a one-man
chemical weapons lab.

245
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,570
[dramatic music]

246
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,300
- It was something certainly

247
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,173
that I've never seen before
in my life.

248
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,770
I was totally shocked
and amazed at the same time.

249
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It appeared to be
one giant chemistry lab.

250
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:38,173
It was just something beyond
my wildest imagination.

251
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,530
Mr. Swango's apartment was
mostly filled with

252
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:44,197
various poisons.

253
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:47,173
There was Terro Ant Poison
bottles,

254
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,600
some with liquid,
some empty.

255
00:11:49,633 --> 00:11:53,333
And there were recipes cards
in plain sight

256
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:55,727
with information
on how you make

257
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:58,297
ricin, botulism toxins,

258
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,703
potassium cyanide.

259
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:03,574
Then we noticed
he had articles cut out,

260
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,400
and they were tragedies,

261
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,173
horrible crimes,
and shootings,

262
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,370
and stabbings,
and he seemed to be making

263
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,130
a scrapbook out of
all this stuff.

264
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,096
So now we had

265
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:18,173
a good circumstantial evidence
case against him,

266
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,570
not counting the direct
scientific evidence

267
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,270
of the hair samples
and the tea sample

268
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,200
from the paramedic
headquarters.

269
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:28,103
- With all the circumstantial
evidence,

270
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:30,133
investigators
desperately needed

271
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,026
to find out information
about Swango's past

272
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:36,066
in order to help build
their case against him.

273
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,230
- Michael Swango
grew up in Quincy,

274
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:39,996
went to the local schools.

275
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:41,733
He played the clarinet.
He'd done well in school.

276
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:44,667
He came from a family that
lived there for generations.

277
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,430
The father was in the military

278
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:51,767
and he was absent for much of
Michael Swango's youth.

279
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,630
And then he had a mother
who favored him.

280
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:57,097
He was doted upon.

281
00:12:57,133 --> 00:12:59,073
She really had put all
of her hopes

282
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,000
and ambitions onto him.

283
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,333
- I'd found out Mike had gone
to a medical school

284
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:09,767
down at Southern Illinois
University.

285
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,370
- He had virtually no friends
in medical school.

286
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,100
He had acquaintances.

287
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:16,703
He was very self-absorbed.
He buckled down.

288
00:13:16,734 --> 00:13:18,234
He did everything
he was asked to do,

289
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:20,366
and he got his degree
and went on

290
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,770
to a prestigious residency
and internship.

291
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,200
People thought he was
very odd and peculiar.

292
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:28,033
He had a nickname,
"00 Swango,"

293
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:31,426
which meant "License To Kill,"
after the James Bond character,

294
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:34,327
but it was kind of a joke.

295
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:38,667
Nobody seriously thought
that he had killed.

296
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,370
- He was right at
the point of becoming

297
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,100
a full-fledged doctor

298
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:43,773
when he had to complete
his internship,

299
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,130
and he went to Columbus, Ohio
to finish up.

300
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,466
- The alarm bells went off
at Ohio State

301
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,430
because his internship
had been terminated

302
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:56,167
after some very, very
suspicious deaths

303
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,000
and quite a bit of evidence

304
00:13:59,033 --> 00:14:01,503
that he might have been
directly involved.

305
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:04,133
There were eye-witnesses
in many cases

306
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:07,366
who saw him inject something
into the patient.

307
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,670
Moments later,
that patient is paralyzed,

308
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,300
dies.

309
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:18,403
The records show that there
were more emergency calls

310
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:20,733
where people are on
the brink of dying

311
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:22,297
in the weeks
that he had been there

312
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:26,003
than there had been in
the entire previous year.

313
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:29,033
But no charges
had ever been filed.

314
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:32,766
The investigation was cursory,
it was fumbled.

315
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,770
The last thing they wanted was
word that a potential killer

316
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,400
had been in their midst,
wreaking havoc

317
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:43,003
on the hospital and
killing his patients.

318
00:14:43,033 --> 00:14:45,473
So he finished
his internship

319
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,100
and they then said,
"No, you cannot come back

320
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:49,533
as a resident."

321
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:51,427
But they were willing
to give him

322
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:53,267
these glowing recommendations

323
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,030

was that Mike Swango was seen
going into the local store

Fort Myers, Florida,

357

home with him in a box.

to use ants in his apartment

the Terro Ant Poison,
