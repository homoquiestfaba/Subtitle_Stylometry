1
00:00:03,166 --> 00:00:04,374
A doctor with an obsession
with sickness and death.

2
00:00:07,333 --> 00:00:10,273
- People who were not supposed
to die were dying.

3
00:00:10,300 --> 00:00:13,100
- On a scale of one to ten
in terms of dangerousness,

4
00:00:13,133 --> 00:00:16,033
the chart has to go even
higher than ten.

5
00:00:16,066 --> 00:00:19,296
- He left a trail of victims
in his wake.

6
00:00:19,333 --> 00:00:23,473
- My father was screaming and
yelling, "Stop the burning!"

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:28,100
- He's injecting patients
and then watching them die.

8
00:00:28,133 --> 00:00:30,403
- To quench his thirst
for killing,

9
00:00:30,433 --> 00:00:34,573
he hid his deadly secrets

10
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,400
and led authorities on an
epic, international manhunt.

11
00:00:39,433 --> 00:00:41,303
- It was a fugitive
investigation

12
00:00:41,333 --> 00:00:43,073
and we're running
out of time.

13
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:45,130
- Always one step ahead,

14
00:00:45,166 --> 00:00:46,626
could this killer
ever be stopped?

15
00:00:46,667 --> 00:00:49,297
- I arrested him.
he made bond,

16
00:00:49,333 --> 00:00:51,073
and he's out.

17
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,170
We didn't know what he was
gonna do next.

18
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:57,000
[dramatic music]

19
00:00:57,033 --> 00:00:59,133
- As a doctor
and certified expert

20
00:00:59,166 --> 00:01:01,126
for the California
Medical Board,

21
00:01:01,166 --> 00:01:04,126
I know firsthand that most
medical professionals

22
00:01:04,166 --> 00:01:06,526
will go to any length
to help their patients,

23
00:01:06,567 --> 00:01:12,397
but in some cases there are
those with a deranged mind

24
00:01:12,433 --> 00:01:14,633
and a license to kill.

25
00:01:14,667 --> 00:01:18,127
â™ª â™ª

26
00:01:18,166 --> 00:01:21,496
It's a classic story with
a deadly twist.

27
00:01:21,533 --> 00:01:24,633
An all-American Midwest boy
grows up to become

28
00:01:24,667 --> 00:01:28,367
one of the most prolific
serial killers of all time.

29
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,270
How did he get away with it?

30
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:33,430
Because this murderer
was in one of the most

31
00:01:33,467 --> 00:01:37,497
trusted, respected
professions you can find.

32
00:01:41,233 --> 00:01:44,203
[eerie music]

33
00:01:44,233 --> 00:01:48,473
â™ª â™ª

34
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:50,470
- I just graduated
from high school,

35
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,400
and you know,
I got to make a decision.

36
00:01:52,433 --> 00:01:54,333
Do I go through
the path of college or

37
00:01:54,367 --> 00:01:57,627
do I choose my childhood dream
of being a paramedic?

38
00:01:57,667 --> 00:02:01,327
So I decided to work as
a paramedic

39
00:02:01,367 --> 00:02:04,397
there at Blessing Hospital.

40
00:02:04,433 --> 00:02:07,473
- We had a crew of
16 paramedics.

41
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:09,200
We would get along well.

42
00:02:09,233 --> 00:02:11,273
We would always
stick around and drink coffee

43
00:02:11,300 --> 00:02:13,370
with the oncoming crew
and just sit and rap

44
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:16,300
and talk about
the calls we had and--

45
00:02:16,333 --> 00:02:21,203
So yeah, we were close.
We were a close family.

46
00:02:21,233 --> 00:02:23,533
- So my first day
of working full-time

47
00:02:23,567 --> 00:02:25,427
I walk into the
paramedic quarters.

48
00:02:25,467 --> 00:02:27,327
In the middle of the table
was a box of donuts.

49
00:02:27,367 --> 00:02:29,127
So I grabbed one,

50
00:02:29,166 --> 00:02:31,596
started eating it,
and I would say about

51
00:02:31,633 --> 00:02:34,133
20 minutes later,
I'm starting to get

52
00:02:34,166 --> 00:02:37,096
this little oozy feeling
in my stomach

53
00:02:37,133 --> 00:02:39,203
and I just felt like
I was gonna get sick.

54
00:02:39,233 --> 00:02:40,703
I go into the bathroom and

55
00:02:40,734 --> 00:02:43,374
that's when
I started vomiting.

56
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:45,630
Everything that I had
in my stomach

57
00:02:45,667 --> 00:02:51,197
at that point in time
was vomited out.

58
00:02:51,233 --> 00:02:53,233
Once I vomited,
I did feel better

59
00:02:53,266 --> 00:02:55,126
and I went back down
to the paramedic quarters

60
00:02:55,166 --> 00:02:59,526
and there I hear somebody else
vomiting in the bathroom.

61
00:02:59,567 --> 00:03:02,497
Out walks another paramedic
and he just describes

62
00:03:02,533 --> 00:03:05,703
an incident
that just occurred to me.

63
00:03:05,734 --> 00:03:07,534
There's about five
of us that experienced

64
00:03:07,567 --> 00:03:09,497
the nausea and the vomiting.

65
00:03:09,533 --> 00:03:11,233
And so that just seemed
to be odd

66
00:03:11,266 --> 00:03:13,696
how we were fine one minute

67
00:03:13,734 --> 00:03:17,604
and now here we are
vomiting the next minute.

68
00:03:17,633 --> 00:03:20,503
The director is alarmed
by what was going on

69
00:03:20,533 --> 00:03:22,203
and he calls in a team

70
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:24,173
from the Adams County
Health Department

71
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:26,530
to come in and analyze
the coffee, the tea,

72
00:03:26,567 --> 00:03:29,197
some of the food that may have
been in the refrigerator.

73
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:30,573
There were also looking
for the donuts,

74
00:03:30,600 --> 00:03:33,230
but the donuts were gone.

75
00:03:33,266 --> 00:03:35,266
- We went to where
the donuts were made

76
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:37,530
to see if anyone else
had reported sickness

77
00:03:37,567 --> 00:03:39,497
and there wasn't,

78
00:03:39,533 --> 00:03:42,303
so they didn't know
what it was.

79
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,730
- I'm working,
state of Illinois requires

80
00:03:46,767 --> 00:03:49,427
an ambulance to be on standby
at high school football games.

81
00:03:49,467 --> 00:03:52,297
So I'd signed up,
and it's about halftime

82
00:03:52,333 --> 00:03:54,133
when my partner,
he says to me,

83
00:03:54,166 --> 00:03:55,426
"Do you want anything to drink?

84
00:03:55,467 --> 00:03:56,667
"I'm gonna go up to the
concession stand.

85
00:03:56,700 --> 00:03:58,270
I can buy you something."

86
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:01,670
I said,
"Sure, I'll take a soda."

87
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:05,300
So he comes back
and I started drinking it,

88
00:04:05,333 --> 00:04:07,703
and I would say about the start
of the third quarter

89
00:04:07,734 --> 00:04:09,734
is when I'm starting to feel
nauseated again.

90
00:04:09,767 --> 00:04:11,427
Like, I can't believe this.

91
00:04:11,467 --> 00:04:13,727
I feel like I'm gonna
get sick again.

92
00:04:13,767 --> 00:04:16,267
And as soon as I get
to the parking lot,

93
00:04:16,300 --> 00:04:19,300
there I started vomiting.

94
00:04:19,333 --> 00:04:22,333
And it was
the most horrific vomiting

95
00:04:22,367 --> 00:04:24,297
you could ever imagine.

96
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:26,573
I am vomiting to the point
where, you know,

97
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,230
there's nothing in me.

98
00:04:29,266 --> 00:04:31,226
I had no idea
what was going on.

99
00:04:31,266 --> 00:04:34,196
I was just thinking
perhaps I had the flu.

100
00:04:37,667 --> 00:04:39,567
- In just 48 hours,

101
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,430
there were two incidents
of extreme nausea and vomiting

102
00:04:42,467 --> 00:04:44,297
among the paramedics.

103
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:46,733
And even though they were
seasoned medical professionals,

104
00:04:46,767 --> 00:04:48,697
they couldn't explain why.

105
00:04:48,734 --> 00:04:52,574
Then when a third wave of
unexplained sickness happened,

106
00:04:52,600 --> 00:04:55,500
fears began to emerge
that it was more

107
00:04:55,533 --> 00:04:57,603
than just a coincidence.

108
00:04:57,633 --> 00:05:01,003
[tense music]

109
00:05:01,033 --> 00:05:03,373
- My partner and I
were working together.

110
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:04,730
We make iced tea,

111
00:05:04,767 --> 00:05:07,697
and my partner and I
both had our glasses,

112
00:05:07,734 --> 00:05:09,434
which had our initials on 'em,

113
00:05:09,467 --> 00:05:11,397
and we filled 'em with tea.

114
00:05:11,433 --> 00:05:14,473
Well, we got a call
and we left.

115
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,300
- When they got back,

116
00:05:16,333 --> 00:05:18,603
his partner started
drinking the tea again,

117
00:05:18,633 --> 00:05:20,673
and he noticed there was
a sweet flavor to it.

118
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,670
His partner was diabetic,
doesn't put sugar in his tea.

119
00:05:23,700 --> 00:05:26,600
So he asked Greg, he goes,
"Greg, taste this."

120
00:05:26,633 --> 00:05:29,603
- So I picked it up,
took a little drink of it

121
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:31,503
and I thought,
"Something's not right.

122
00:05:31,533 --> 00:05:33,233
There's something in that."

123
00:05:33,266 --> 00:05:35,726
So we put the tea
in a container

124
00:05:35,767 --> 00:05:38,767
and we took and we locked it
in my partner's locker

125
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,770
'cause we wanted
to have it analyzed.

126
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,530
So then about
two, three minutes later,

127
00:05:43,567 --> 00:05:47,397
one of our other off-duty
paramedics made the comment,

128
00:05:47,433 --> 00:05:50,373
he said, "Boy, I just seen
the weirdest thing.

129
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,030
"Brent's partner was
leaving in his car

130
00:05:54,066 --> 00:05:56,466
"and he looked down the street
and apparently

131
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,530
"seen you guys coming
in the ambulance,

132
00:05:58,567 --> 00:06:01,627
and he threw it in reverse
and he went down an alley."

133
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:03,367
And the paramedic said,

134
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:09,370
"It was if he didn't
want you to see him."

135
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:14,070
By this time,
we'd put things together.

136
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:16,730
The donuts that made
everyone sick.

137
00:06:16,767 --> 00:06:19,097
Brent went to
the football game.

138
00:06:19,133 --> 00:06:21,103
Soda was purchased.
He drank it.

139
00:06:21,133 --> 00:06:23,003
He was sick.

140
00:06:23,033 --> 00:06:25,333
The tea that my partner drank
was sweet

141
00:06:25,367 --> 00:06:28,367
and he never sweetens his tea.

142
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:31,400
- This is completely crazy.
We're all in shock.

143
00:06:31,433 --> 00:06:33,003
You know,
we're only speculating,

144
00:06:33,033 --> 00:06:34,673
but all the fingers are
starting to point towards

145
00:06:34,700 --> 00:06:38,070
my partner,
Michael Swango.

146
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:41,070
- Things were adding up,
but at the same time

147
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,000
I didn't think he would ever
do anything.

148
00:06:44,033 --> 00:06:46,673
We had no fallouts, no bad
feelings towards each other

149
00:06:46,700 --> 00:06:47,700
that I was aware of.

150
00:06:47,734 --> 00:06:50,504
I had none toward him.

151
00:06:50,533 --> 00:06:54,673
- On the surface, he looks
like a good ol' American boy.

152
00:06:54,700 --> 00:06:57,000
[sirens wailing]

153
00:06:57,033 --> 00:06:59,433
But yet one morning
when I'm working with Mike,

154
00:06:59,467 --> 00:07:01,497
he started talking
about ambulance calls

155
00:07:01,533 --> 00:07:03,373
and he says to me,

156
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,470
"My ultimate fantasy
ambulance call

157
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:08,700
"is when a busload of children

158
00:07:08,734 --> 00:07:11,034
"are hitting head-on
with a tanker truck

159
00:07:11,066 --> 00:07:13,526
full of gasoline
and it blows up."

160
00:07:13,567 --> 00:07:16,767
And he describes seeing
the scene with kids

161
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,030
hanging over
barbed wire fences,

162
00:07:19,066 --> 00:07:21,426
the charred bodies
hanging out of the windows.

163
00:07:21,467 --> 00:07:22,767
And I thought to myself,

164
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,700
"Here we are trying
to save people's lives

165
00:07:24,734 --> 00:07:28,074
and he's describing a scene
where there is no life left."

166
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:31,600
That, you know, leads me
to believe that he loves death.

167
00:07:34,533 --> 00:07:36,333
- With all these circumstances

168
00:07:36,367 --> 00:07:38,697
and all the different
incidents that happened,

169
00:07:38,734 --> 00:07:41,604
we thought we got to get
substantial evidence.

170
00:07:41,633 --> 00:07:46,103
So a few days after that,
Mike went out on a call.

171
00:07:46,133 --> 00:07:50,373
And one of the other paramedics
opened up Mike's duffel bag

172
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:55,170
and looked in it and seen
full bottles and empty bottles

173
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:59,170
of Terro Ant Killer.

174
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:04,130
- Now we think we have found
the bullet which he was using.

175
00:08:04,166 --> 00:08:10,596
- And so we decided it was time
to go to the authorities.

176
00:08:10,633 --> 00:08:13,703
- We obtained
the suspected tea sample

177
00:08:13,734 --> 00:08:16,534
collected by the paramedics
themselves.

178
00:08:16,567 --> 00:08:19,397
And I took it to
the state crime lab,

179
00:08:19,433 --> 00:08:22,073
and then they come back
and confirm that

180
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:26,430
actually that tea sample
had contained arsenic.

181
00:08:26,467 --> 00:08:29,627
I looked up the symptoms
of arsenic poisoning,

182
00:08:29,667 --> 00:08:32,097
and that was consistent
with the reports

183
00:08:32,133 --> 00:08:36,003
from the paramedics of them
becoming violently ill.

184
00:08:36,033 --> 00:08:39,103
And I confirmed that
the major ingredient

185
00:08:39,133 --> 00:08:42,203
in Terro Ant Poison is arsenic.

186
00:08:42,233 --> 00:08:43,573
- Also during
the investigation,

187
00:08:43,600 --> 00:08:45,170
they took samples
of my fingernail,

188
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:47,100
they took samples of my hair,

189
00:08:47,133 --> 00:08:51,433
and they found high levels of
arsenic in my hair samples.

190
00:08:51,467 --> 00:08:54,197
So at this point in time,
Mike was still working

191
00:08:54,233 --> 00:08:57,173
as a paramedic there
at Blessing Hospital.

192
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,000
So I'm not accepting any food
or beverage from Mike

193
00:09:02,033 --> 00:09:05,673
because I do think
he's a dangerous person.

194
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:08,530
[soft dramatic music]

195
00:09:08,567 --> 00:09:10,727
The assistant state's attorney
met with us

196
00:09:10,767 --> 00:09:12,667
and said that I think
we have enough evidence

197
00:09:12,700 --> 00:09:15,000
that we can go forth
with trial

198
00:09:15,033 --> 00:09:18,233
and we can go with
assault charges.

199
00:09:18,266 --> 00:09:19,696
I wish we had enough evidence

200
00:09:19,734 --> 00:09:22,234
to charge him with
attempted murder.

201
00:09:22,266 --> 00:09:25,996
- We can prove that he had
placed some kind of poison

202
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,673
on the food products
or in the drinks,

203
00:09:28,700 --> 00:09:31,670
but we could not
necessarily prove

204
00:09:31,700 --> 00:09:36,100
that he wanted to kill anybody.

205
00:09:36,133 --> 00:09:37,703
So I was able to obtain

206
00:09:37,734 --> 00:09:39,634
an arrest warrant
for Michael Swango

207
00:09:39,667 --> 00:09:41,567
for aggravated battery.

208
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,770
After I arrested him,
he made bond and he's out,

209
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,500
and then a trial date is set.

210
00:09:48,533 --> 00:09:50,633
- So I hear that Mike
is out free.

211
00:09:50,667 --> 00:09:52,767
I'm nervous as heck

212
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,170
because I know what
he's capable of doing.

213
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,230
Is he mad at us to the point
where he's gonna come at us?

214
00:09:58,266 --> 00:10:00,726
- And we couldn't take
the change with this guy

215
00:10:00,767 --> 00:10:02,527
running loose in our community.

216
00:10:02,567 --> 00:10:05,627
We didn't know what he was
gonna do next.

217
00:10:05,667 --> 00:10:07,497
So we obtained
a search warrant

218
00:10:07,533 --> 00:10:10,173
in order to get more evidence,

219
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:14,200
and make a beeline
for his apartment.

220
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:18,073
As we walked in
Mr. Swango's apartment,

221
00:10:18,100 --> 00:10:21,170
I got a sense that
I was in an evil place.

222
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,700
I was in the presence of evil.

223
00:10:23,734 --> 00:10:26,704
[dramatic music]

224
00:10:26,734 --> 00:10:28,574
- Coming up...

225
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:31,100
- My father would tell us
that there was a doctor

226
00:10:31,133 --> 00:10:33,733
that came by and would point
at him and tell him,

227
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,597
"You're next."

228
00:10:35,633 --> 00:10:37,173
- He injects
the pregnant woman.

229
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:40,730
She immediately starts going
into convulsions.

230
00:10:40,767 --> 00:10:42,997
- The killer had been
in there minutes

231
00:10:43,033 --> 00:10:45,103
wreaking havoc on the hospital.

232
00:10:45,133 --> 00:10:47,173
- At this point,
it was a manhunt.

233
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,100
We're very aware that
the clock is running.

234
00:10:49,133 --> 00:10:52,733
- Anybody that has this
sort of compulsion to kill

235
00:10:52,767 --> 00:10:54,067
if you don't catch
them right away,

236
00:10:54,100 --> 00:10:55,670
they're gonna continue killing.

237
00:11:00,467 --> 00:11:01,127
- When Michael Swango

238
00:11:01,133 --> 00:11:01,433
- When Michael Swango
was charged with

239
00:11:03,166 --> 00:11:04,296
aggravated battery
for poisoning

240
00:11:04,333 --> 00:11:06,133
his fellow paramedics,

241
00:11:06,166 --> 00:11:08,566
investigators secured a warrant
to search his apartment.

242
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:11,630
They were looking for evidence
to support their allegations,

243
00:11:11,667 --> 00:11:14,097
but what they found was
nothing short

244
00:11:14,133 --> 00:11:16,573
of a one-man
chemical weapons lab.

245
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:19,570
[dramatic music]

246
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,300
- It was something certainly

247
00:11:22,333 --> 00:11:25,173
that I've never seen before
in my life.

248
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:28,770
I was totally shocked
and amazed at the same time.

249
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,000
It appeared to be
one giant chemistry lab.

250
00:11:33,033 --> 00:11:38,173
It was just something beyond
my wildest imagination.

251
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,530
Mr. Swango's apartment was
mostly filled with

252
00:11:42,567 --> 00:11:44,197
various poisons.

253
00:11:44,233 --> 00:11:47,173
There was Terro Ant Poison
bottles,

254
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,600
some with liquid,
some empty.

255
00:11:49,633 --> 00:11:53,333
And there were recipes cards
in plain sight

256
00:11:53,367 --> 00:11:55,727
with information
on how you make

257
00:11:55,767 --> 00:11:58,297
ricin, botulism toxins,

258
00:11:58,333 --> 00:12:00,703
potassium cyanide.

259
00:12:00,734 --> 00:12:03,574
Then we noticed
he had articles cut out,

260
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:05,400
and they were tragedies,

261
00:12:05,433 --> 00:12:07,173
horrible crimes,
and shootings,

262
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:10,370
and stabbings,
and he seemed to be making

263
00:12:10,400 --> 00:12:13,130
a scrapbook out of
all this stuff.

264
00:12:13,166 --> 00:12:15,096
So now we had

265
00:12:15,133 --> 00:12:18,173
a good circumstantial evidence
case against him,

266
00:12:18,200 --> 00:12:20,570
not counting the direct
scientific evidence

267
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:23,270
of the hair samples
and the tea sample

268
00:12:23,300 --> 00:12:26,200
from the paramedic
headquarters.

269
00:12:26,233 --> 00:12:28,103
- With all the circumstantial
evidence,

270
00:12:28,133 --> 00:12:30,133
investigators
desperately needed

271
00:12:30,166 --> 00:12:33,026
to find out information
about Swango's past

272
00:12:33,066 --> 00:12:36,066
in order to help build
their case against him.

273
00:12:36,100 --> 00:12:38,230
- Michael Swango
grew up in Quincy,

274
00:12:38,266 --> 00:12:39,996
went to the local schools.

275
00:12:40,033 --> 00:12:41,733
He played the clarinet.
He'd done well in school.

276
00:12:41,767 --> 00:12:44,667
He came from a family that
lived there for generations.

277
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:46,430
The father was in the military

278
00:12:46,467 --> 00:12:51,767
and he was absent for much of
Michael Swango's youth.

279
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,630
And then he had a mother
who favored him.

280
00:12:55,667 --> 00:12:57,097
He was doted upon.

281
00:12:57,133 --> 00:12:59,073
She really had put all
of her hopes

282
00:12:59,100 --> 00:13:04,000
and ambitions onto him.

283
00:13:04,033 --> 00:13:07,333
- I'd found out Mike had gone
to a medical school

284
00:13:07,367 --> 00:13:09,767
down at Southern Illinois
University.

285
00:13:10,000 --> 00:13:12,370
- He had virtually no friends
in medical school.

286
00:13:12,400 --> 00:13:14,100
He had acquaintances.

287
00:13:14,133 --> 00:13:16,703
He was very self-absorbed.
He buckled down.

288
00:13:16,734 --> 00:13:18,234
He did everything
he was asked to do,

289
00:13:18,266 --> 00:13:20,366
and he got his degree
and went on

290
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,770
to a prestigious residency
and internship.

291
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,200
People thought he was
very odd and peculiar.

292
00:13:25,233 --> 00:13:28,033
He had a nickname,
"00 Swango,"

293
00:13:28,066 --> 00:13:31,426
which meant "License To Kill,"
after the James Bond character,

294
00:13:31,467 --> 00:13:34,327
but it was kind of a joke.

295
00:13:34,367 --> 00:13:38,667
Nobody seriously thought
that he had killed.

296
00:13:38,700 --> 00:13:40,370
- He was right at
the point of becoming

297
00:13:40,400 --> 00:13:42,100
a full-fledged doctor

298
00:13:42,133 --> 00:13:43,773
when he had to complete
his internship,

299
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:48,130
and he went to Columbus, Ohio
to finish up.

300
00:13:48,166 --> 00:13:50,466
- The alarm bells went off
at Ohio State

301
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,430
because his internship
had been terminated

302
00:13:53,467 --> 00:13:56,167
after some very, very
suspicious deaths

303
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:59,000
and quite a bit of evidence

304
00:13:59,033 --> 00:14:01,503
that he might have been
directly involved.

305
00:14:01,533 --> 00:14:04,133
There were eye-witnesses
in many cases

306
00:14:04,166 --> 00:14:07,366
who saw him inject something
into the patient.

307
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:11,670
Moments later,
that patient is paralyzed,

308
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:14,300
dies.

309
00:14:14,333 --> 00:14:18,403
The records show that there
were more emergency calls

310
00:14:18,433 --> 00:14:20,733
where people are on
the brink of dying

311
00:14:20,767 --> 00:14:22,297
in the weeks
that he had been there

312
00:14:22,333 --> 00:14:26,003
than there had been in
the entire previous year.

313
00:14:26,033 --> 00:14:29,033
But no charges
had ever been filed.

314
00:14:29,066 --> 00:14:32,766
The investigation was cursory,
it was fumbled.

315
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:37,770
The last thing they wanted was
word that a potential killer

316
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:40,400
had been in their midst,
wreaking havoc

317
00:14:40,433 --> 00:14:43,003
on the hospital and
killing his patients.

318
00:14:43,033 --> 00:14:45,473
So he finished
his internship

319
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:48,100
and they then said,
"No, you cannot come back

320
00:14:48,133 --> 00:14:49,533
as a resident."

321
00:14:49,567 --> 00:14:51,427
But they were willing
to give him

322
00:14:51,467 --> 00:14:53,267
these glowing recommendations

323
00:14:53,300 --> 00:14:56,030
just as long as he went
somewhere else.

324
00:14:56,066 --> 00:14:58,226
â™ª â™ª

325
00:14:58,266 --> 00:15:01,196
- With knowledge of Swango's
suspicious past,

326
00:15:01,233 --> 00:15:03,473
prosecutors in Quincy
were under pressure

327
00:15:03,500 --> 00:15:05,130
to make the charges stick.

328
00:15:05,166 --> 00:15:07,766
So six months after
Swango's arrest,

329
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:11,300
the DA began presenting
their case at trial.

330
00:15:11,333 --> 00:15:14,333
[tense music]

331
00:15:14,367 --> 00:15:16,127
â™ª â™ª

332
00:15:16,166 --> 00:15:18,266
- I believe there were
68 physical exhibits

333
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,470
offered into evidence.

334
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,200
â™ª â™ª

335
00:15:23,233 --> 00:15:25,403
Some of the evidence
that Billy Myer had

336
00:15:25,433 --> 00:15:28,473
was that Mike Swango was seen
going into the local store

337
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:30,270
wearing his paramedic uniform,

338
00:15:30,300 --> 00:15:32,300
and bought all of
the Terro Ant Poison

339
00:15:32,333 --> 00:15:35,073
that they had in stock,

340
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,530
which would be enough to poison
one heck of a lot of ants.

341
00:15:38,567 --> 00:15:40,767
That was a fascinating
part of the case,

342
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:43,100
because if he's so smart,

343
00:15:43,133 --> 00:15:45,733
why was he leaving
a trail like this?

344
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:50,427
- At trial, Michael tried to
come up with an explanation

345
00:15:50,467 --> 00:15:54,097
why he had all
the Terro Ant Poison.

346
00:15:54,133 --> 00:15:58,003
He claimed that he had
a severe ant problem.

347
00:15:58,033 --> 00:16:01,173
And so he had called
our local exterminator

348
00:16:01,200 --> 00:16:03,330
who went out and looked
at these ants

349
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:05,227
that were running all over
his apartment,

350
00:16:05,266 --> 00:16:09,026
which weren't there when we
executed the search warrant.

351
00:16:09,066 --> 00:16:12,526
- The exterminator testified
about the ants, and he said,

352
00:16:12,567 --> 00:16:15,167
"Those ants are not
indigenous to the Midwest.

353
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:18,030
They're only found in Florida."

354
00:16:18,066 --> 00:16:20,496
I'd learned that he had
surreptitiously,

355
00:16:20,533 --> 00:16:23,373
while free on bail,
went to visit his mother,

356
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,770
I believe in
Fort Myers, Florida,

357
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,070
and brought ants
home with him in a box.

358
00:16:29,100 --> 00:16:33,330
He thought he was smart enough
to use ants in his apartment

359
00:16:33,367 --> 00:16:35,297
as an explanation for
the Terro Ant Poison,

360
00:16:35,333 --> 00:16:37,403
but he didn't consider
those ants

361
00:16:37,433 --> 00:16:39,533
don't belong
in the state of Illinois.

362
00:16:39,567 --> 00:16:43,527
So it was things like that
that made him unbelievable,

363
00:16:43,567 --> 00:16:49,227
and I ultimately concluded
that he was lying.

364
00:16:49,266 --> 00:16:51,126
- So I was in the courtroom

365
00:16:51,166 --> 00:16:54,466
when the verdict was handed
down by Judge Cashman.

366
00:16:54,500 --> 00:16:57,570
And to our relief,

367
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,130
the judge convicts him
of assault.

368
00:17:01,166 --> 00:17:02,496
So all the paramedics
that were involved,

369
00:17:02,533 --> 00:17:04,273
we were relieved.

370
00:17:04,300 --> 00:17:06,170
All of our work paid off.

371
00:17:06,200 --> 00:17:10,330
- It was just like,
"Oh, finally. Got him."

372
00:17:10,367 --> 00:17:13,597
I was happy, very happy.
We all were.

373
00:17:13,633 --> 00:17:17,203
- He was charged with seven
counts of aggravated battery

374
00:17:17,233 --> 00:17:20,203
by administering
a toxic substance.

375
00:17:20,233 --> 00:17:23,603
- And he gives him five years,
so at that point in time

376
00:17:23,633 --> 00:17:28,233
I know that he's gonna
be in prison.

377
00:17:28,266 --> 00:17:31,366
- And while he was in prison,
he sent me a Christmas card

378
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,100
wishing my family
a safe Christmas.

379
00:17:33,133 --> 00:17:34,433
He didn't wish me
a safe Christmas.

380
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:36,367
He wished my family
a safe Christmas.

381
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:38,230
And he was in prison,

382
00:17:38,266 --> 00:17:42,096
but I knew he wasn't going
to be there forever.

383
00:17:42,133 --> 00:17:44,433
- Unfortunately,
the satisfaction

384
00:17:44,467 --> 00:17:47,027
over Swango's conviction
was short-lived.

385
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,296
Just 21/2 years into
his prison sentence,

386
00:17:49,333 --> 00:17:53,503
he was released and a new
nightmare was about to begin.

387
00:17:59,567 --> 00:18:00,327
- Michael Swango served time

388
00:18:00,333 --> 00:18:01,073
- Michael Swango served time
for poisoning his co-workers

389
00:18:03,166 --> 00:18:05,496
and had his medical license
revoked in Illinois,

390
00:18:05,533 --> 00:18:08,233
but incredibly,
that didn't stop him

391
00:18:08,266 --> 00:18:10,326
from practicing medicine
elsewhere.

392
00:18:10,367 --> 00:18:12,527
He was able to land a job
as a doctor

393
00:18:12,567 --> 00:18:14,297
at the University
of South Dakota

394
00:18:14,333 --> 00:18:16,233
by telling a half truth.

395
00:18:16,266 --> 00:18:19,226
He acknowledged his
aggravated battery conviction,

396
00:18:19,266 --> 00:18:20,666
but lied saying

397
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:24,230
he had been unjustly convicted
for a bar fight,

398
00:18:24,266 --> 00:18:27,196
which was terrifying
because at that point

399
00:18:27,233 --> 00:18:29,373
he was working in
a different state

400
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:32,130
where no one knew
he poisoned his co-workers.

401
00:18:32,166 --> 00:18:35,126
[suspenseful music]

402
00:18:35,166 --> 00:18:38,426
â™ª â™ª

403
00:18:38,467 --> 00:18:42,527
â™ª â™ª

404
00:18:44,667 --> 00:18:48,497
- He was hired to be
a full-fledged doctor again.

405
00:18:48,533 --> 00:18:53,133
And obviously
the hospital did not know

406
00:18:53,166 --> 00:18:55,126
about Michael Swango's past.

407
00:18:55,166 --> 00:18:57,766
After working there
a little over a year,

408
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:01,270
a TV show ran a piece
about him.

409
00:19:01,300 --> 00:19:03,270
- Why all the poisons
in your house?

410
00:19:03,300 --> 00:19:08,170
- And it revealed the whole
poisoning episode in Quincy.

411
00:19:08,200 --> 00:19:11,570
- Back in 1986,
while Swango was in prison,

412
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:13,570
he was interviewed
by "20/20"

413
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,530
about his poisoning
conviction.

414
00:19:15,567 --> 00:19:17,627
An excerpt from that interview

415
00:19:17,667 --> 00:19:19,667
re-aired while he was working
in South Dakota

416
00:19:19,700 --> 00:19:22,200
which blew his cover.

417
00:19:22,233 --> 00:19:24,403
- There was the ant poison,
and the gopher poison,

418
00:19:24,433 --> 00:19:26,303
and then the arsenic.

419
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:27,733
- All I know is I had
an ant problem

420
00:19:27,767 --> 00:19:29,997
and I took care of it
as best I could.

421
00:19:30,033 --> 00:19:32,403
I did not do these things.

422
00:19:32,433 --> 00:19:34,303
- It's hard to believe you.

423
00:19:34,333 --> 00:19:36,233
- Well, I'm sorry.

424
00:19:36,266 --> 00:19:39,496
- And that created a furor
in Sioux Falls.

425
00:19:39,533 --> 00:19:41,433
- Are you--
take this to court if you...

426
00:19:41,467 --> 00:19:42,697
- I really can't say why.

427
00:19:42,734 --> 00:19:45,304
- The bad publicity
was horrendous.

428
00:19:45,333 --> 00:19:46,703
- I can't live this way.
I can't--

429
00:19:46,734 --> 00:19:49,234
Please, come on.

430
00:19:49,266 --> 00:19:50,666
- And so he had to be
terminated from

431
00:19:50,700 --> 00:19:53,770
the University
of South Dakota,

432
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,570
and he left.

433
00:19:58,767 --> 00:20:01,697
- After suffering such
incriminating press,

434
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:05,634
a high-profile firing,
and an assault conviction,

435
00:20:05,667 --> 00:20:08,597
surely Michael Swango
would never be allowed

436
00:20:08,633 --> 00:20:10,573
to step foot in
another hospital again.

437
00:20:10,600 --> 00:20:12,600
Yet just six months later,

438
00:20:12,633 --> 00:20:15,373
he obtained a medical license
in New York,

439
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:19,330
this time by exploiting
a weak spot in the system.

440
00:20:19,367 --> 00:20:22,327
[tense music]

441
00:20:22,367 --> 00:20:26,227
â™ª â™ª

442
00:20:26,266 --> 00:20:28,526
- He does apply to
a psychiatric residence at

443
00:20:28,567 --> 00:20:32,997
the Veteran's Hospital on
Long Island in New York State.

444
00:20:33,033 --> 00:20:34,703
And that was clever because

445
00:20:34,734 --> 00:20:39,234
it's hard to recruit people
for psychiatric residences.

446
00:20:39,266 --> 00:20:40,696
Doesn't have the pay,
the prestige

447
00:20:40,734 --> 00:20:42,634
that some branches
of medicine have.

448
00:20:42,667 --> 00:20:45,027
So he found that vulnerability.

449
00:20:45,066 --> 00:20:47,596
And amazingly after
all of this,

450
00:20:47,633 --> 00:20:50,433
the people in Long Island
were even less thorough

451
00:20:50,467 --> 00:20:53,497
in vetting him than they
had been in South Dakota.

452
00:20:53,533 --> 00:20:57,433
- On his job application,
he claimed his sentence

453
00:20:57,467 --> 00:21:00,427
where he went to jail
was commuted by the governor

454
00:21:00,467 --> 00:21:03,227
and all of his rights
and privileges

455
00:21:03,266 --> 00:21:06,296
and everything else
had been reinstated.

456
00:21:06,333 --> 00:21:08,703
Basically, he lied.

457
00:21:08,734 --> 00:21:11,004
- He didn't say
he had been convicted

458
00:21:11,033 --> 00:21:13,373
of poisoning people
in Illinois.

459
00:21:13,400 --> 00:21:17,030
Bu you know, he was smart.
He was articulate.

460
00:21:17,066 --> 00:21:19,496
He could be very charming
when he wanted to be,

461
00:21:19,533 --> 00:21:20,773
usually when he had some goal

462
00:21:21,000 --> 00:21:22,770
he wanted to accomplish
for himself,

463
00:21:23,000 --> 00:21:27,000
like working with patients.

464
00:21:30,333 --> 00:21:33,703
- My father was a patient
at the VA hospital.

465
00:21:33,734 --> 00:21:36,274
[somber music]

466
00:21:36,300 --> 00:21:40,030
He was known as Tom, or Tommy.

467
00:21:40,066 --> 00:21:41,626
He had a lot of friends.

468
00:21:41,667 --> 00:21:44,997
He was a very personable
person.

469
00:21:45,033 --> 00:21:49,433
And he was in the army
all during World War II.

470
00:21:49,467 --> 00:21:52,527
He was a flag waver.

471
00:21:52,567 --> 00:21:56,767
One day, Dad was on
a ladder and he fell.

472
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:59,670
He couldn't move
his legs anymore.

473
00:21:59,700 --> 00:22:03,570
He ended up going
to the VA hospital.

474
00:22:05,567 --> 00:22:07,767
- After several months
in the hospital,

475
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:09,600
rather than improving,

476
00:22:09,633 --> 00:22:14,703
tom developed some
inexplicable complications.

477
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:19,104
- One time we went up
to the VA hospital to see him.

478
00:22:19,133 --> 00:22:23,573
We see them
wheel this bed out.

479
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:25,500
And his arms were failing,

480
00:22:25,533 --> 00:22:28,303
and he was screaming
and obviously in pain.

481
00:22:28,333 --> 00:22:29,703
He kept saying,
"Stop the burning."

482
00:22:29,734 --> 00:22:31,434
They just told us that he had

483
00:22:31,467 --> 00:22:32,697
a staph infection
in the brain.

484
00:22:32,734 --> 00:22:34,734
"We're doing everything
we can."

485
00:22:38,066 --> 00:22:41,096
He ended up in
the Intensive Care.

486
00:22:41,133 --> 00:22:42,733
I'm like,

487
00:22:42,767 --> 00:22:45,427
"There's something wrong here.
What's going on?"

488
00:22:45,467 --> 00:22:48,567
We didn't see anything
life-threatening

489
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:52,030
when we went
into the hospital.

490
00:22:52,066 --> 00:22:53,766
And...

491
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:57,530
from Intensive Care,
we kept seeing this doctor

492
00:22:57,567 --> 00:23:00,697
who would ask my mother to
sign the "Do Not Resuscitate."

493
00:23:00,734 --> 00:23:03,504
And this went on
for quite a few days.

494
00:23:03,533 --> 00:23:05,403
And finally I had
turned around and I said,

495
00:23:05,433 --> 00:23:08,073
"Wait a minute, why do you need
a 'Do Not Resuscitate'?"

496
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:11,530
Because I knew when you sign
a "Do Not Resuscitate,"

497
00:23:11,567 --> 00:23:13,067
it is signed.

498
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,470
You don't have to repeat
it every day.

499
00:23:15,500 --> 00:23:20,170
So this doctor just did not
give me a good feeling.

500
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,070
His name was Dr. Swango.

501
00:23:23,100 --> 00:23:26,070
[dramatic music]

â™ª â™ª

503
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:32,430
He was in ICU for two weeks

504
00:23:32,467 --> 00:23:38,397
when he started saying things
that were very strange.

505
00:23:38,433 --> 00:23:40,673
He would tell us
that there was a doctor

506
00:23:40,700 --> 00:23:44,000
that came by every night
and would point at him

507
00:23:44,033 --> 00:23:48,203
and tell him,
"You're next."

508
00:23:48,233 --> 00:23:50,503
And we would just
brush it off like,

509
00:23:50,533 --> 00:23:52,433
"This man's hallucinating."

510
00:23:52,467 --> 00:23:53,697
He was like,
"They're gonna kill me."

511
00:23:53,734 --> 00:23:55,634
I was like, "Dad,
nobody's gonna kill you.

512
00:23:55,667 --> 00:23:59,597
You're here to get better."

513
00:23:59,633 --> 00:24:02,603

515
00:24:06,533 --> 00:24:09,703
And the one night that
we did not go up there,

516
00:24:09,734 --> 00:24:12,104
it was about 8:00 at night,
we got a phone call

517
00:24:12,133 --> 00:24:15,433
that he'd passed away.

518
00:24:15,467 --> 00:24:19,497
Nobody expected him to die.
He was in good health.

519
00:24:19,533 --> 00:24:23,773
I couldn't believe
this was happening

520
00:24:24,000 --> 00:24:26,000
'cause he was my father.

00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:38,370
- By the fall of 1993,
Michael Swango

524
00:24:40,300 --> 00:24:42,070
had been working at
the VA Medical Center

525
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:44,170
on Long Island for four months

526
00:24:44,200 --> 00:24:46,600
when out of the blue,
the administration

527
00:24:46,633 --> 00:24:49,103
received
an alarming phone call.

528
00:24:49,133 --> 00:24:50,573
[tense music]

529
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:52,470
â™ª â™ª

530
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:54,600
- The head of the medical
school in South Dakota

531
00:24:54,633 --> 00:24:57,073
where Swango had been
terminated

532
00:24:57,100 --> 00:25:00,100
called the dean of the
Veteran's Hospital

533
00:25:00,133 --> 00:25:03,303
and briefed him
on Swango's true past.

534
00:25:03,333 --> 00:25:06,103
- And so the director
of the medical center

535
00:25:06,133 --> 00:25:09,073
made the decision
he should be terminated

536
00:25:09,100 --> 00:25:13,200
for misrepresentation
on his application.

537
00:25:13,233 --> 00:25:16,703
And I escorted him
off the campus.

538
00:25:16,734 --> 00:25:19,104
â™ª â™ª

539
00:25:19,133 --> 00:25:22,773
By this time, panic had
set in at the medical center.

540
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:25,270
So we started going over
patient charts

541
00:25:25,300 --> 00:25:30,070
for every one of the patients
that Swango had treated.

542
00:25:30,100 --> 00:25:33,130
We did see some irregularity.

543
00:25:33,166 --> 00:25:36,566
- Several patients who had been
under Swango's direct care

544
00:25:36,600 --> 00:25:39,130
had inexplicably died

545
00:25:39,166 --> 00:25:42,626
from causes unrelated
to their original diagnosis.

546
00:25:42,667 --> 00:25:47,167
Officials at the VA Hospital
needed to question Swango

547
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,200
and collect more evidence
to prove his involvement.

548
00:25:50,233 --> 00:25:53,673
But, sensing the heat,
Swango skipped town.

549
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:59,170
So the decision was made
to call the FBI.

550
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:01,730
While Dr. Swango was
at the VA Hospital,

551
00:26:01,767 --> 00:26:03,727
he came to the authority's
attention

552
00:26:03,767 --> 00:26:08,997
because again, people who were
not supposed to die were dying.

553
00:26:09,033 --> 00:26:12,773
- The allegation was that
he was potentially responsible

554
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:15,500
for all of these
suspicious deaths.

555
00:26:15,533 --> 00:26:19,103
I really wanted to get a--
an understanding--

556
00:26:19,133 --> 00:26:22,533
who is this guy?
What's motivating him?

557
00:26:22,567 --> 00:26:24,597
And so I started to
get the sense

558
00:26:24,633 --> 00:26:28,003
that this was somebody
that doesn't feel good

559
00:26:28,033 --> 00:26:30,133
unless they're actually
victimizing somebody.

560
00:26:30,166 --> 00:26:33,766
He's poisoning other people
just to watch the reaction,

561
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:37,270
to sort of relish
in their misery.

562
00:26:37,300 --> 00:26:40,100
I think it's clear that
he shares a lot of traits

563
00:26:40,133 --> 00:26:41,633
with psychopaths:

564
00:26:41,667 --> 00:26:46,197
egotistical, no conscience.

565
00:26:46,233 --> 00:26:49,303
On a scale of one to ten
in terms of dangerousness,

566
00:26:49,333 --> 00:26:52,303
the chart has to
go even higher than ten,

567
00:26:52,333 --> 00:26:55,733
because murdering patients,
it's almost a fixation.

568
00:26:55,767 --> 00:26:58,267
So there's an urgency
in finding this guy

569
00:26:58,300 --> 00:27:03,130
because anybody that has this
sort of compulsion to kill,

570
00:27:03,166 --> 00:27:04,296
if you don't catch them
right away,

571
00:27:04,333 --> 00:27:06,273
they're gonna continue killing.

572
00:27:06,300 --> 00:27:09,330
[dramatic music]

573
00:27:09,367 --> 00:27:11,267
- At the time,
there really was no hard proof

574
00:27:11,300 --> 00:27:13,300
that Dr. Swango was a killer.

575
00:27:13,333 --> 00:27:16,233
So the best we could do with
the early parts of the case

576
00:27:16,266 --> 00:27:19,026
were charge him with lying
to federal officials.

577
00:27:19,066 --> 00:27:20,596
In that when he made
his application

578
00:27:20,633 --> 00:27:23,073
to come into the residency
at the VA,

579
00:27:23,100 --> 00:27:27,270
he had lied about his
previous felony conviction.

580
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,270
- Not many people
read the fine print

581
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:32,030
on the bottom of
a federal application,

582
00:27:32,066 --> 00:27:34,226
but it says,
if you lie on this thing

583
00:27:34,266 --> 00:27:36,296
you're guilty of misstatement,

584
00:27:36,333 --> 00:27:38,733
and the exposure time
is five years.

585
00:27:38,767 --> 00:27:43,097
So while we're trying
to find out and gather proof

586
00:27:43,133 --> 00:27:46,633
that he's killed people,
to buy time we may be able

587
00:27:46,667 --> 00:27:50,197
to charge him with a violation.

588
00:27:50,233 --> 00:27:52,233
- And the warrant is issued,

589
00:27:52,266 --> 00:27:55,666
but the basic first step
was to find him.

590
00:27:55,700 --> 00:27:57,600
No one knew where he was.

591
00:27:57,633 --> 00:28:01,073
- He seemed like
he had just vanished.

592
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:05,600
- My feeling is this guy is
gonna surface somewhere again,

593
00:28:05,633 --> 00:28:10,733
and it's gonna be around
more dead bodies.

594
00:28:10,767 --> 00:28:13,027
- So at this point,
it was a manhunt,

595
00:28:13,066 --> 00:28:16,726
it was a fugitive
investigation.

596
00:28:16,767 --> 00:28:18,997
- With the feds
in hot pursuit,

597
00:28:19,033 --> 00:28:22,273
Swango was running out
of places to hide.

598
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:25,700
His solution,
he fled the country.

599
00:28:25,734 --> 00:28:27,404
The authorities
didn't yet know it,

600
00:28:27,433 --> 00:28:31,473
but Swango made it
all the way to Africa.

601
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,170
Why Africa?

602
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,130
It offered a market desperate
for doctors

603
00:28:36,166 --> 00:28:38,426
where Swango could avoid
a thorough background check

604
00:28:38,467 --> 00:28:40,767
and do what he loved most,

605
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:44,470
attend to patients as
a full-fledged physician.

606
00:28:44,500 --> 00:28:47,470
[tense music]

607
00:28:47,500 --> 00:28:49,770
â™ª â™ª

608
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,370
- He wasn't even there
too long

609
00:28:52,400 --> 00:28:56,770
before all of a sudden,
patients started to die.

610
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:01,030
He targets, in one case,
it's a pregnant woman.

611
00:29:01,066 --> 00:29:02,626
And he injects her.

612
00:29:02,667 --> 00:29:06,397
She immediately starts
going into convulsions.

613
00:29:06,433 --> 00:29:09,133
And she-- she actually survives,

614
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:12,366
but she tells the nurses
that it was Swango,

615
00:29:12,400 --> 00:29:14,430
and he denies it.

616
00:29:14,467 --> 00:29:15,997
[lightning crackling]

617
00:29:16,033 --> 00:29:19,003
[eerie music]

618
00:29:19,033 --> 00:29:21,203
â™ª â™ª

619
00:29:21,233 --> 00:29:25,303
The nursing staff saw him
coming into the ward

620
00:29:25,333 --> 00:29:27,503
at all hours of the night,

621
00:29:27,533 --> 00:29:32,703
and standing over patients
that weren't even his.

622
00:29:32,734 --> 00:29:36,704
- The nurses there were
very, very frightened of him.

623
00:29:36,734 --> 00:29:38,304
- For the first time
in this case,

624
00:29:38,333 --> 00:29:40,003
the medical authorities

625
00:29:40,033 --> 00:29:41,303
notified the police
immediately,

626
00:29:41,333 --> 00:29:44,133
and Swango's privileges
were suspended,

627
00:29:44,166 --> 00:29:46,266
and they started
their own investigation.

628
00:29:46,300 --> 00:29:48,400
- While the police were trying
to investigate him,

629
00:29:48,433 --> 00:29:51,503
it appears that he fled.

630
00:29:51,533 --> 00:29:54,073
So it's telling me
that maybe this guy

631
00:29:54,100 --> 00:29:58,330
is even more prolific
than any of us imagined.

632
00:29:58,367 --> 00:30:00,767
[dramatic music]

633
00:30:01,000 --> 00:30:03,400
- Swango was accused
by Mnene Hospital

634
00:30:03,433 --> 00:30:06,303
of poisoning seven patients,
five of whom died.

635
00:30:06,333 --> 00:30:10,473
Once again, he fled before
authorities could detain him.

636
00:30:10,500 --> 00:30:13,230
And once again,
his plan appeared to be

637
00:30:13,266 --> 00:30:16,066
to find a new venue for
his murderous ways.

638
00:30:20,233 --> 00:30:23,373
[suspenseful music]

639
00:30:23,400 --> 00:30:25,170
- We received a call
from the agent

640
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:27,700
down at
the Chicago O'Hare Airport.

641
00:30:27,734 --> 00:30:30,334
And he said, "Jim, I've caught
a fugitive you're looking for.

642
00:30:30,367 --> 00:30:32,197
"His name is Michael Swango.

643
00:30:32,233 --> 00:30:34,203
And he just got off a plane
from Africa."

644
00:30:34,233 --> 00:30:37,003
And he said, "I see you want
him for a minor felony, for

645
00:30:37,033 --> 00:30:39,373
a false statement regarding
his federal application."

646
00:30:39,400 --> 00:30:41,430
And I said, "I've been looking
long and hard for this guy

647
00:30:41,467 --> 00:30:44,067
and he's very dangerous
despite the low charge."

648
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:46,400
[tense, dramatic music]

649
00:30:46,433 --> 00:30:48,203
So he was arrested,

650
00:30:48,233 --> 00:30:51,033
and they transported
him back to New York.

651
00:30:51,066 --> 00:30:55,726
â™ª â™ª

652
00:30:55,767 --> 00:30:59,197
- He was prosecuted
after about six months or so.

653
00:30:59,233 --> 00:31:00,773
He entered a guilty plea.

654
00:31:01,000 --> 00:31:04,470
He was sentenced
to 42 months incarceration.

655
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:08,200
In a federal system,
you do about 85% of your time,

656
00:31:08,233 --> 00:31:11,003
so we knew he'd be
in for about 3 years.

657
00:31:11,033 --> 00:31:13,373
- So now that he's gone
for 36 months,

658
00:31:13,400 --> 00:31:17,300
that gives us that time period
to investigate

659
00:31:17,333 --> 00:31:19,303
everywhere Dr. Swango had been

660
00:31:19,333 --> 00:31:23,103
and try to find at least one
homicide in any jurisdiction

661
00:31:23,133 --> 00:31:24,773
that we could prove.

662
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,500
- You know, we have a short
period of time to do this,

663
00:31:27,533 --> 00:31:31,173
with the full knowledge that
if we can't and he's released,

664
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,470
that he's going to continue
what he's been doing

665
00:31:33,500 --> 00:31:35,300
for the last 10, 15 years.

666
00:31:35,333 --> 00:31:37,373
You have to be right
because if you aren't,

667
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,270
the circumstances
are that other people

668
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:41,070
are probably gonna die.

669
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:48,965
- After an international

670
00:31:49,000 --> 00:31:49,500
- After an international
manhunt, the FBI finally had

671
00:31:51,433 --> 00:31:54,233
fugitive Michael Swango
behind bars,

672
00:31:54,266 --> 00:31:55,666
but not for long.

673
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:57,630
Even though officials
suspected him

674
00:31:57,667 --> 00:32:00,567
of being a serial killer
with an appetite for poison,

675
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:02,270
they couldn't prove it.

676
00:32:02,300 --> 00:32:04,600
So they brought him down
on a lesser charge,

677
00:32:04,633 --> 00:32:08,433
hoping it would buy them time
to build a murder case.

678
00:32:08,467 --> 00:32:11,567
But could they amass enough
evidence to convict him

679
00:32:11,600 --> 00:32:14,030
before his impending
release date?

680
00:32:14,066 --> 00:32:17,026
[pensive music]

681
00:32:17,066 --> 00:32:20,396
â™ª â™ª

682
00:32:20,433 --> 00:32:23,273
- This particular case raised
substantial challenges

683
00:32:23,300 --> 00:32:25,170
in a number of ways.

684
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:27,430
First,
the stories we were hearing

685
00:32:27,467 --> 00:32:31,667
about Michael Swango poisoning
people dated back to 1983.

686
00:32:31,700 --> 00:32:34,430
We're sitting here now in 1998,

687
00:32:34,467 --> 00:32:37,197
so if we're going back
15 years on cases,

688
00:32:37,233 --> 00:32:39,673
he was in multiple
jurisdictions.

689
00:32:39,700 --> 00:32:42,200
And we sent our team members,

690
00:32:42,233 --> 00:32:43,473
you know,
to every jurisdiction.

691
00:32:43,500 --> 00:32:45,170
They went to Ohio.

692
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:46,170
They went to South Dakota.

693
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:47,470
They went to Quincy.

694
00:32:47,500 --> 00:32:49,200
They went to Africa.

695
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:52,333
We had every single file

696
00:32:52,367 --> 00:32:54,327
from every hospital
that he was in.

697
00:32:54,367 --> 00:32:57,167
We had medical examiners
looking to see

698
00:32:57,200 --> 00:33:01,100
whether the persons that
ended up being deceased,

699
00:33:01,133 --> 00:33:03,633
was it a natural death
or was there some suspicion

700
00:33:03,667 --> 00:33:07,067
here that we should look
further into?

701
00:33:07,100 --> 00:33:08,430
In the Northport VA,

702
00:33:08,467 --> 00:33:12,527
we concentrated
on three people.

703
00:33:12,567 --> 00:33:15,167
- One of the persons
was an individual

704
00:33:15,200 --> 00:33:17,330
by the name of Tom Sammarco.

705
00:33:17,367 --> 00:33:22,227
Tom Sammarco had gone to the
VA for a routine procedure.

706
00:33:22,266 --> 00:33:25,226
Based on the admission reports

707
00:33:25,266 --> 00:33:29,126
and we know
the ultimate demise,

708
00:33:29,166 --> 00:33:30,366
it shouldn't have happened.

709
00:33:30,400 --> 00:33:33,370
[tense music]

710
00:33:33,400 --> 00:33:35,270
â™ª â™ª

711
00:33:35,300 --> 00:33:37,330
I'd contacted his daughter.

712
00:33:37,367 --> 00:33:41,467
I said that the VA had
several, what we feel may be

713
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:44,370
suspicious deaths
that took place,

714
00:33:44,400 --> 00:33:46,700
and that one of the--
one of her father's

715
00:33:46,734 --> 00:33:49,474
treating doctors,
Michael Swango,

716
00:33:49,500 --> 00:33:51,570
may have been involved.

717
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:55,370
- It was like, "Oh, my God.
I remember him."

718
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,600
Dr. Swango was the doctor
that came by every night

719
00:33:58,633 --> 00:34:01,733
and asked my mother to sign
a "Do Not Resuscitate."

720
00:34:01,767 --> 00:34:04,297
You know when you get
that gut feeling

721
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:05,633
that something's not right?

722
00:34:05,667 --> 00:34:08,167
It was like that gut feeling.

723
00:34:08,200 --> 00:34:10,530
There was just something
that would get under my skin

724
00:34:10,567 --> 00:34:12,397
when I see him.

725
00:34:12,433 --> 00:34:15,203
- Tom Valery explained
to us that they wanted

726
00:34:15,233 --> 00:34:19,273
permission to exhume
my father's body.

727
00:34:19,300 --> 00:34:22,230
So my mother said, "Okay."

728
00:34:22,266 --> 00:34:23,726
And she looked at me
and I said,

729
00:34:23,767 --> 00:34:25,497
"Whatever you want, Mom."

730
00:34:25,533 --> 00:34:29,133
â™ª â™ª

731
00:34:29,166 --> 00:34:32,666
- We did exhume three bodies,
and our medical experts

732
00:34:32,700 --> 00:34:36,470
did the medical testing on them
and gave us the proof

733
00:34:36,500 --> 00:34:38,730
that they did not die
from natural causes.

734
00:34:38,767 --> 00:34:40,567
They did not die
from the illness

735
00:34:40,600 --> 00:34:43,200
they were brought into
the hospital, but in fact,

736
00:34:43,233 --> 00:34:48,303
had died because they
were injected with a drug.

737
00:34:48,333 --> 00:34:51,433
Our experts found two
different drugs in the body.

738
00:34:51,467 --> 00:34:55,597
One was succinylcholine.
The second one was epinephrine.

739
00:34:55,633 --> 00:34:58,673
- Succinylcholine is
a skeleton muscle relaxant

740
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,730
that causes short-term
paralysis

741
00:35:00,767 --> 00:35:04,367
and is used during surgeries
as part of general anesthesia.

742
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:06,430
It's not natural to the body,

743
00:35:06,467 --> 00:35:09,627
so investigators knew it
had been injected.

744
00:35:09,667 --> 00:35:12,467
Epinephrine, the other drug
that was detected,

745
00:35:12,500 --> 00:35:14,630
is naturally produced
in the body,

746
00:35:14,667 --> 00:35:18,267
but not to the high degree that
was present in these cases.

747
00:35:18,300 --> 00:35:21,400
- So once we exhumed the bodies
and did the scientific testing,

748
00:35:21,433 --> 00:35:23,573
that was the first time
that we knew we had

749
00:35:23,600 --> 00:35:28,600
real, tangible evidence
of a murder case.

750
00:35:28,633 --> 00:35:31,603
- We got a call,
and Tom told us

751
00:35:31,633 --> 00:35:35,273
that they did find a chemical
in my father's body

752
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:40,330
and that this is what may have
caused my father's death.

753
00:35:40,367 --> 00:35:44,327
So I began to
start questioning things.

754
00:35:44,367 --> 00:35:48,597
Maybe it's possible
my father was murdered.

755
00:35:48,633 --> 00:35:51,603
[melancholic music]

756
00:35:51,633 --> 00:35:54,673
â™ª â™ª

757
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:58,400
And we didn't believe him
when he told us

758
00:35:58,433 --> 00:36:01,603
that he was going--
he was gonna be murdered

759
00:36:01,633 --> 00:36:05,433
by someone in the hospital.

760
00:36:05,467 --> 00:36:08,627
We thought he was
hallucinating.

761
00:36:08,667 --> 00:36:13,367
And the guilt,
it just keeps living on.

762
00:36:13,400 --> 00:36:15,330
Maybe if we had
believed my father,

763
00:36:15,367 --> 00:36:17,997
he wouldn't have been dead.

764
00:36:22,433 --> 00:36:24,503
- Detectives had proven

765
00:36:24,533 --> 00:36:27,003
the patients were poisoned
at the VA hospital,

766
00:36:27,033 --> 00:36:30,073
but in order to charge Swango
with those murders,

767
00:36:30,100 --> 00:36:31,700
they still needed to either

768
00:36:31,734 --> 00:36:34,634
directly link him to the
poisons used on the victims,

769
00:36:34,667 --> 00:36:37,297
or get a confession.

770
00:36:37,333 --> 00:36:39,373
- We're very aware that
the clock is running.

771
00:36:39,400 --> 00:36:42,470
In two weeks, the door opens,
he gets out.

772
00:36:42,500 --> 00:36:45,600
And we had such a hard time
finding him the first time.

773
00:36:45,633 --> 00:36:47,273
I'm very concerned
that if he does get out,

774
00:36:47,300 --> 00:36:49,100
we'll never see him again
and they'll be

775
00:36:49,133 --> 00:36:53,533
many more deaths
associated with him.

776
00:36:53,567 --> 00:36:56,267
Tom Neer and I decided
we would go out,

777
00:36:56,300 --> 00:36:58,070
try to talk to Dr. Swango

778
00:36:58,100 --> 00:37:01,570
and see what he would give us.

779
00:37:01,600 --> 00:37:03,570
- As we go in for
the interview,

780
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,270
Swango is escorted in
and I was unprepared to see

781
00:37:07,300 --> 00:37:12,670
how disheveled and how drawn
his countenance was.

782
00:37:12,700 --> 00:37:15,500
He did not look like the brash,

783
00:37:15,533 --> 00:37:18,533
arrogant person
that I was expecting.

784
00:37:18,567 --> 00:37:21,467
Another inmate tried
to slash his throat,

785
00:37:21,500 --> 00:37:25,630
missed, and he's got
a scar right across his face.

786
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:28,397
- He has a defeated look
in his eye,

787
00:37:28,433 --> 00:37:30,373
and we could tell, of course,

788
00:37:30,400 --> 00:37:33,130
that he's very frightened to be
around the other inmates.

789
00:37:33,166 --> 00:37:36,696
So Tom Neer decided on
a good interview strategy.

790
00:37:36,734 --> 00:37:39,034
- Collectively, we've learned
in

791
00:37:39,066 --> 00:37:41,066
the behavioral analysis unit

792
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:43,530
that with people that have

793
00:37:43,567 --> 00:37:46,497
the kind of characteristics
that he has,

794
00:37:46,533 --> 00:37:49,073
no real remorse over
other people,

795
00:37:49,100 --> 00:37:51,400
very egotistical,
very arrogant,

796
00:37:51,433 --> 00:37:53,403
they're not gonna confess
on something

797
00:37:53,433 --> 00:37:54,673
based on emotion.

798
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:56,300
They're gonna confess
to something

799
00:37:56,333 --> 00:37:59,773
based on self-interest
and preservation.

800
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:02,330
And so we said,
"Well, Mike, actually,

801
00:38:02,367 --> 00:38:04,327
"we didn't come here
to interview you.

802
00:38:04,367 --> 00:38:07,497
"We came to give information.
We want to tell you something.

803
00:38:07,533 --> 00:38:10,733
"You're about ready to be
released in the next few days,

804
00:38:10,767 --> 00:38:12,727
"but actually,
you're not gonna get released.

805
00:38:12,767 --> 00:38:15,427
"We're gonna extradite you
to Africa

806
00:38:15,467 --> 00:38:20,727
to answer the attempted murder
things over there."

807
00:38:20,767 --> 00:38:24,027
- And I slide their warrant
and the extradition treaty

808
00:38:24,066 --> 00:38:25,696
which had just been
ratified with Zimbabwe,

809
00:38:25,734 --> 00:38:27,634
and I said, "I'll make sure
the Zimbabwe authorities

810
00:38:27,667 --> 00:38:30,597
get everything they need
to conduct a fair trial."

811
00:38:30,633 --> 00:38:32,073
What a sociopath
will always do

812
00:38:32,100 --> 00:38:34,100
what's right in
the moment for him.

813
00:38:34,133 --> 00:38:36,703
In Zimbabwe,
he'd probably be executed.

814
00:38:36,734 --> 00:38:39,004
So if he wants
to save his life,

815
00:38:39,033 --> 00:38:40,173
he should probably talk to us.

816
00:38:40,200 --> 00:38:41,530
- It's either Africa

817
00:38:41,567 --> 00:38:42,997
or you're gonna take
a plea here.

818
00:38:43,033 --> 00:38:47,033
So it's your choice.

819
00:38:47,066 --> 00:38:48,766
And he comes across
the table and goes,

820
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,700
"You know and I know!

821
00:38:50,734 --> 00:38:54,134
The only way I'm coming back
from Africa is in a body bag."

822
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:01,530
- Dr. Swango is due to get

823
00:39:01,533 --> 00:39:02,003
- Dr. Swango is due to get
out of prison

824
00:39:03,400 --> 00:39:05,470
at some time by
the end of July.

825
00:39:05,500 --> 00:39:08,730
So we maybe have two weeks
to get a confession.

826
00:39:08,767 --> 00:39:10,767
So we went to the prison
to talk to Dr. Swango.

827
00:39:11,000 --> 00:39:12,630
And we told him, "we're gonna
put you on a plane,

828
00:39:12,667 --> 00:39:14,567
and we're all gonna take you
back to Zimbabwe."

829
00:39:14,600 --> 00:39:18,000
[dramatic music]

830
00:39:18,033 --> 00:39:21,503
So Dr. Swango said,
"They'll hang me."

831
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:22,773
He goes, "They'll hang
me very quickly

832
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:25,200
if you send me back to Africa."

833
00:39:25,233 --> 00:39:30,473
And I just said, "Well,
you picked your venue."

834
00:39:30,500 --> 00:39:32,100
- By the end of
the conversation,

835
00:39:32,133 --> 00:39:34,533
what we worked out
was Swango said,

836
00:39:34,567 --> 00:39:36,627
"I'm not saying
I did anything,

837
00:39:36,667 --> 00:39:39,997
but if I did do something,
I'll do time here."

838
00:39:40,033 --> 00:39:42,503
I said, "Well, Mike,
what if you took a plea here

839
00:39:42,533 --> 00:39:46,533
"for some murders here
and we were to get you

840
00:39:46,567 --> 00:39:50,427
your own cell and you had your
own TV here in America."

841
00:39:50,467 --> 00:39:52,467
- He didn't want to be
sent back to Africa

842
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:54,130
where he would eventually
be executed

843
00:39:54,166 --> 00:39:55,466
and he didn't want to serve
his prison time

844
00:39:55,500 --> 00:39:57,530
in a general population
situation

845
00:39:57,567 --> 00:40:00,597
where there'd probably be
another attempt on his life.

846
00:40:00,633 --> 00:40:02,703
So Dr. Swango pretty much

847
00:40:02,734 --> 00:40:04,534
negotiated with us
there on the spot.

848
00:40:04,567 --> 00:40:06,727
I was very excited.
Tom was very excited.

849
00:40:06,767 --> 00:40:08,597
While I didn't get
a confession,

850
00:40:08,633 --> 00:40:10,673
I really thought we had
generated a plea.

851
00:40:10,700 --> 00:40:13,570
[dramatic music]

852
00:40:13,600 --> 00:40:18,100
â™ª â™ª

853
00:40:18,133 --> 00:40:20,573
- One week before
his scheduled release,

854
00:40:20,600 --> 00:40:25,130
prosecutors filed
an indictment against Swango.

855
00:40:25,166 --> 00:40:27,766
- This was not an indictment
where we were just charging

856
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:29,170
murders at the VA.

857
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:30,530
We formulated an indictment

858
00:40:30,567 --> 00:40:32,697
that went back to 1983,

859
00:40:32,734 --> 00:40:35,434
encompassed everything that,
you know,

860
00:40:35,467 --> 00:40:39,227
he did in the last 15 years
or so.

861
00:40:39,266 --> 00:40:42,196
Michael Swango
was willing to admit

862
00:40:42,233 --> 00:40:46,003
that he had killed people in
the Northport VA and elsewhere.

863
00:40:46,033 --> 00:40:48,173
And he had two requests,

864
00:40:48,200 --> 00:40:50,470
that we take the death penalty
off the table

865
00:40:50,500 --> 00:40:53,700
and that he not be extradited
back to Zimbabwe.

866
00:40:53,734 --> 00:40:56,434
It was a good deal in my eyes
and I believe,

867
00:40:56,467 --> 00:40:58,297
you know, why everyone
agreed to it is

868
00:40:58,333 --> 00:41:00,733
we did have some fears
if we went to trial,

869
00:41:00,767 --> 00:41:02,567
we didn't know what the outcome
of that trial would be.

870
00:41:02,600 --> 00:41:04,100
Here we had certainty.

871
00:41:04,133 --> 00:41:06,203
He was going to serve life
without parole,

872
00:41:06,233 --> 00:41:08,633
so there was complete certainty

873
00:41:08,667 --> 00:41:10,227
that he would never
get out of jail.

874
00:41:10,266 --> 00:41:13,296
And then lastly, it was
closure for the families,

875
00:41:13,333 --> 00:41:14,773
where they didn't have
to relive this

876
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,600
by coming in and testifying.

877
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:19,603
[tense, dramatic music]

878
00:41:19,633 --> 00:41:22,673
â™ª â™ª

879
00:41:22,700 --> 00:41:24,270
- Swango was in the well
of the courtroom,

880
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:26,070
and he goes very quiet

881
00:41:26,100 --> 00:41:30,170
and he admits to murdering
three of the veterans.

882
00:41:30,200 --> 00:41:32,270
He would serve three
consecutive life sentences

883
00:41:32,300 --> 00:41:35,500
at the Supermax facility
in Florence, Colorado

884
00:41:35,533 --> 00:41:38,533
with no chance at parole.

885
00:41:38,567 --> 00:41:40,597
Then I thought for
the first time in 20 years

886
00:41:40,633 --> 00:41:42,203
what everybody suspected,

887
00:41:42,233 --> 00:41:44,703
that Dr. Swango
was a serial killer,

888
00:41:44,734 --> 00:41:48,774
has finally been proven.

889
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,700
- It's one of those
good-feeling moments

890
00:41:50,734 --> 00:41:54,704
in law enforcement
where we prevailed in the end.

891
00:41:54,734 --> 00:41:57,004
I think that's what every
law enforcement person wants,

892
00:41:57,033 --> 00:42:02,303
is to feel like they've helped,
they've given justice.

893
00:42:02,333 --> 00:42:05,103
- I'm just glad that
he was taken off the streets.

894
00:42:05,133 --> 00:42:07,103
We've locked somebody up.

895
00:42:07,133 --> 00:42:09,333
No other way to put it,
but he was a monster.

896
00:42:09,367 --> 00:42:12,097
He was a medical doctor,
somebody people look up to,

897
00:42:12,133 --> 00:42:15,673
who was going around
killing people.

898
00:42:15,700 --> 00:42:19,230
- My brush with death
was very close,

899
00:42:19,266 --> 00:42:23,666
and I'm fortunate that
Michael Swango didn't kill me.

900
00:42:23,700 --> 00:42:26,370
And hopefully, he'll never see
the light of day again

901
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:28,270
and be behind bars
where, I think,

902
00:42:28,300 --> 00:42:33,600
that's where he belongs
for the rest of his life.

903
00:42:33,633 --> 00:42:36,103
- My father, Thomas Sammarco,

904
00:42:36,133 --> 00:42:40,273
he's a big part of
our life that's missing.

905
00:42:40,300 --> 00:42:42,270
[melancholic music]

906
00:42:42,300 --> 00:42:45,130
â™ª â™ª

907
00:42:45,166 --> 00:42:46,526
And he was a good man

908
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:51,697
and he never did anything
to hurt anybody.

909
00:42:51,734 --> 00:42:57,134
Michael Swango
was just pure evil.

910
00:42:57,166 --> 00:43:01,366
He destroyed a whole family.

911
00:43:01,400 --> 00:43:06,030
- In the end, this diabolical
maniac was brought to justice.

912
00:43:06,066 --> 00:43:08,726
Swango was convicted of
killing three patients

913
00:43:08,767 --> 00:43:10,297
including Tommy Sammarco

914
00:43:10,333 --> 00:43:13,033
at the VA Hospital
at Long Island, New York.

915
00:43:13,066 --> 00:43:15,226
And in a separate hearing,
he was also convicted

916
00:43:15,266 --> 00:43:18,326
of killing one patient
at Ohio State University.

917
00:43:18,367 --> 00:43:20,697
In total,
he's suspected of poisoning

918
00:43:20,734 --> 00:43:23,074
as many as 60 people.

919
00:43:31,066 --> 00:43:34,066
