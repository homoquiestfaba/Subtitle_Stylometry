1
00:01:28,869 --> 00:01:30,681
Could you make more noise?

2
00:01:31,043 --> 00:01:32,038
Sorry.

3
00:01:38,763 --> 00:01:40,365
Get down!

4
00:01:52,324 --> 00:01:54,586
Isn't that father's old
cyclotron modulator?

5
00:01:54,641 --> 00:01:55,471
Yep.

6
00:01:55,551 --> 00:01:57,133
Dad was ahead of his time.

7
00:01:57,171 --> 00:02:01,350
All I have to do is adjust the
energy capacitors, and...

8
00:02:15,946 --> 00:02:17,220
- Oh no!
- What's wrong?

9
00:02:17,222 --> 00:02:19,078
It's a trap!

10
00:02:32,694 --> 00:02:34,530
Get Bailey out of here!
Now!

11
00:02:34,554 --> 00:02:36,163
No, I'm not gonna leave you!

12
00:02:36,202 --> 00:02:37,616
Tyra!

13
00:02:49,898 --> 00:02:53,150
I'm gonna kill every one of you.
You butchers.

14
00:03:38,652 --> 00:03:40,171
Lord Vox.

15
00:03:43,416 --> 00:03:45,440
Go ahead, kill me.

16
00:03:45,799 --> 00:03:48,323
Pangea doesn't belong to you anymore.

17
00:03:48,377 --> 00:03:50,432
You and your kind left it behind.

18
00:03:50,446 --> 00:03:52,342
It's ours now and we will never give up

19
00:03:52,368 --> 00:03:54,329
fighting for it and nothing you can do

20
00:03:54,343 --> 00:03:57,405
or say will ever break my spirit.

21
00:03:59,081 --> 00:04:00,853
I love you.

22
00:04:01,569 --> 00:04:03,163
Oh perfect.

23
00:04:10,627 --> 00:04:12,194
It is written...

24
00:04:12,515 --> 00:04:15,052
that we, the freedom fighters of Pangea

25
00:04:15,079 --> 00:04:18,586
who battle so valiantly for our world...

26
00:04:19,755 --> 00:04:23,104
will ultimately hang over
the pit of defeat,

27
00:04:23,339 --> 00:04:25,376
from which no one returns.

28
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,177
Now there's a confidence builder.

29
00:04:28,333 --> 00:04:29,546
Don't worry Bailey,

30
00:04:29,609 --> 00:04:32,078
I will personally lead a raid
to save your sister.

31
00:04:32,102 --> 00:04:33,297
How?

32
00:04:33,352 --> 00:04:35,253
I'm taking most of the men out tonight.

33
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:37,813
We're gonna let ourselves
be captured by Vox's men.

34
00:04:37,826 --> 00:04:39,773
Then, once aboard the mother ship, we'll

35
00:04:39,790 --> 00:04:41,687
take it over and free Tyra.

36
00:04:41,706 --> 00:04:44,495
What happens if Vox decides
to kill you down here?

37
00:04:44,527 --> 00:04:45,523
Then...

38
00:04:47,226 --> 00:04:48,222
then...

39
00:04:49,713 --> 00:04:51,049
oof.

40
00:04:54,102 --> 00:04:55,530
My son...

41
00:04:56,046 --> 00:04:56,998
it is written...

42
00:04:57,002 --> 00:04:58,910
Where?
Where is it written?

43
00:04:59,252 --> 00:05:02,234
You're always talking about
prophecies and destinies,

44
00:05:02,296 --> 00:05:03,754
but my sister's gonna die.

45
00:05:03,791 --> 00:05:06,223
And without her, we all will too.

46
00:05:23,196 --> 00:05:24,920
Oh, I love when you get scientific.

47
00:05:24,944 --> 00:05:26,304
My circuits are all a flutter.

48
00:05:26,337 --> 00:05:27,925
Not now, Illumina.

49
00:05:27,940 --> 00:05:29,106
But I can't help myself.

50
00:05:29,132 --> 00:05:30,872
You're brilliant.
I mean only my Bailey

51
00:05:30,888 --> 00:05:32,772
could send an intergalactic S.O.S.

52
00:05:32,797 --> 00:05:34,845
and build a transporter to bring help

53
00:05:34,858 --> 00:05:36,381
from across the cosmos.

54
00:05:36,411 --> 00:05:38,264
I just hope it works,

55
00:05:38,359 --> 00:05:39,895
because somewhere out there,

56
00:05:39,909 --> 00:05:42,141
I know there's someone who can save us.

57
00:05:42,187 --> 00:05:43,934
I just know it.

58
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:51,825
Hey Bailey,
you might want to come see this.

59
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:54,837
Do you think this is a response
to your S.O.S.?

60
00:05:55,011 --> 00:05:57,600
I said your money or your life.

61
00:05:57,740 --> 00:05:59,333
I'm thinking it over.

62
00:05:59,492 --> 00:06:04,351
I don't know but the signal's point of origin,
is a planet 400 light years away.

63
00:06:06,917 --> 00:06:09,699
Help, help, someone save me!

64
00:06:09,984 --> 00:06:12,594
Captain Zoom, boy am I glad to see you!

65
00:06:12,613 --> 00:06:15,344
I'll have you free in a jiffy, Pappy

66
00:06:16,282 --> 00:06:17,893
Cap, behind you!

67
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:24,877
Look at him. He's amazing!

68
00:06:34,748 --> 00:06:35,709
Come on!

69
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:37,095
Come on!

70
00:06:39,836 --> 00:06:44,241
It's like, he knows ahead of time exactly
where the monster is gonna go.

71
00:06:47,463 --> 00:06:48,863
Thanks. Thanks Cap.

72
00:06:48,879 --> 00:06:52,257
A few more seconds and I would
have been a human shish kebab.

73
00:06:52,281 --> 00:06:55,514
But more importantly, Happy, justice

74
00:06:55,611 --> 00:06:56,986
has been served.

75
00:06:57,068 --> 00:06:58,869
You're right, Cap.

76
00:06:58,972 --> 00:07:01,342
Well, you destroyed the evil Lizard King

77
00:07:01,362 --> 00:07:03,446
so I guess our work here is finished.

78
00:07:03,497 --> 00:07:07,120
Perhaps... but if there's
one thing I've learned...

79
00:07:07,256 --> 00:07:12,549
it's that Captain Zoom's destiny, as Defender
of the Universe was written in the stars.

80
00:07:12,671 --> 00:07:13,885
We can never rest,

81
00:07:13,979 --> 00:07:17,504
in our continuing war against
injustice and oppression.

82
00:07:17,848 --> 00:07:20,862
Together, we can be...

83
00:07:22,205 --> 00:07:23,613
we...

84
00:07:23,825 --> 00:07:28,038
must be, we... will be...

85
00:07:30,139 --> 00:07:31,478
victorious!

86
00:07:31,882 --> 00:07:35,610
That's why, Captain Zoom, is here.

87
00:07:39,533 --> 00:07:42,513
The Adventures of
Captain Zoom in Outer Space,

88
00:07:42,559 --> 00:07:44,988
a presentation of the Dumont Network.

89
00:07:45,068 --> 00:07:47,211
I think we found our man.

90
00:07:49,806 --> 00:07:51,111
Are we done?

91
00:07:52,093 --> 00:07:54,828
Excuse me, excuse me, are we...

92
00:08:13,353 --> 00:08:14,630
Wake up!

93
00:08:15,726 --> 00:08:17,928
Put this on. Now!

94
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:31,515
Hungry?

95
00:08:31,781 --> 00:08:32,802
No.

96
00:08:32,904 --> 00:08:36,357
You've been in that cold lonely
cell for two days without food.

97
00:08:36,831 --> 00:08:41,253
Personally, I can't make it from
breakfast to lunch without a snack.

98
00:08:42,645 --> 00:08:44,173
You look enchanting.

99
00:08:45,039 --> 00:08:47,147
Look, do I really have to wear this?

100
00:08:47,265 --> 00:08:48,918
It's not, really me.

101
00:08:50,268 --> 00:08:52,307
Feel free to take it off.

102
00:08:53,495 --> 00:08:55,471
You make my skin crawl.

103
00:08:56,599 --> 00:09:00,786
You should accept my hospitality with
a little more graciousness, Tyra.

104
00:09:00,825 --> 00:09:02,956
Why should I accept anything from you?

105
00:09:02,975 --> 00:09:06,042
Perhaps you would show more reverence...

106
00:09:06,241 --> 00:09:07,972
if you were dead.

107
00:09:10,007 --> 00:09:11,804
But where's the fun in that.

108
00:09:12,455 --> 00:09:15,344
I'm sure we can come to some
sort of understanding.

109
00:09:15,402 --> 00:09:19,682
One, mutually beneficial to both of us.

110
00:09:22,566 --> 00:09:24,051
Think of it, Tyra.

111
00:09:25,067 --> 00:09:26,865
You could end the war,

112
00:09:27,654 --> 00:09:33,045
the misery, the bloodshed,
today, right now,

113
00:09:33,405 --> 00:09:36,822
and that is only the beginning of
what awaits you as my queen.

114
00:09:36,949 --> 00:09:38,309
Together...

115
00:09:38,925 --> 00:09:41,989
we could usher Pangea into a new era...

116
00:09:42,950 --> 00:09:45,535
of galactic dominance.

117
00:10:06,311 --> 00:10:07,582
You're a lousy kisser.

118
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:08,626
Yeah.

119
00:10:12,956 --> 00:10:15,372
Even in her dreams she resists me.

120
00:10:16,611 --> 00:10:19,181
She's stronger than I thought.

121
00:10:20,909 --> 00:10:23,418
Take her back to her cell, Dr. Yal-Tem.

122
00:10:25,978 --> 00:10:27,468
Yes, my lord.

123
00:10:32,175 --> 00:10:36,021
And now, a special announcement from,
Captain Zoom.

124
00:10:36,119 --> 00:10:41,872
After a life or death struggle like that nothing restores
my energy cells more than a big glass of Chocko Socko.

125
00:10:41,906 --> 00:10:44,017
Tell your mom and dad
to pick some up today.

126
00:10:44,029 --> 00:10:44,980
And remember kids,

127
00:10:45,005 --> 00:10:47,026
send in today for your own
Space Rangers' patch,

128
00:10:47,054 --> 00:10:49,085
official membership card
and decoder ring,

129
00:10:49,112 --> 00:10:50,840
just like Captain Zoom's.

130
00:10:50,941 --> 00:10:52,249
That's right, Happy.

131
00:10:52,278 --> 00:10:55,236
All you need are 25 labels from
any Chocko Socko product

132
00:10:55,274 --> 00:10:56,924
and 10 cents for shipping and handling.

133
00:10:56,961 --> 00:11:00,067
And for you Rangers out there who
already have your decoder rings,

134
00:11:00,084 --> 00:11:03,913
have them ready so you can
understand my secret message.

135
00:11:04,209 --> 00:11:09,417
So remember kids, Chocko Socko is boffo.

136
00:11:09,494 --> 00:11:14,052
And now, we return to
Captain Zoom and the Temple of Death.

137
00:11:14,393 --> 00:11:17,361
Now that's what I call a smooth landing.

138
00:11:17,456 --> 00:11:19,888
No time for celebrating, Happy.

139
00:11:20,039 --> 00:11:23,431
We must say the secret
words to open the temple.

140
00:11:23,740 --> 00:11:28,182
I don't know about anybody else, but I
have my secret decoder ring ready to go.

141
00:11:28,254 --> 00:11:29,938
Stand back, Happy.

142
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,757
The secret words...

143
00:11:31,868 --> 00:11:35,638
to open the gates to the lost,
temple are...

144
00:11:36,175 --> 00:11:37,370
Oh no.

145
00:11:38,443 --> 00:11:39,438
...are...

146
00:11:39,710 --> 00:11:41,249
Hurry, Captain Zoom, hurry.

147
00:11:41,296 --> 00:11:44,501
Yes, Happy, I'm concentrating...

148
00:11:44,858 --> 00:11:47,565
words are, coming to me...

149
00:11:47,783 --> 00:11:53,281
OFFOB... SI... OKCOS... OKCOHC!

150
00:11:56,723 --> 00:12:00,002
Thank you for opening the temple,
Captain Zoom.

151
00:12:00,109 --> 00:12:01,625
I'll take over now.

152
00:12:01,828 --> 00:12:03,114
Genghis Fon.

153
00:12:03,161 --> 00:12:05,514
You evil genius. How did you find us?

154
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:09,311
A tracking device we put on
your jovial sidekick, Happy.

155
00:12:10,471 --> 00:12:13,836
The secrets of the temple,
will be mine now.

156
00:12:14,038 --> 00:12:16,683
Say goodbye, Captain Zoom.

157
00:12:24,158 --> 00:12:26,018
Is that in the script?

158
00:12:29,532 --> 00:12:32,558
The subatomic transport's working.
I did it.

159
00:12:32,559 --> 00:12:34,619
Was there any doubt?

160
00:12:36,463 --> 00:12:39,034
Great God Almighty, she's breaking up!

161
00:12:39,339 --> 00:12:42,688
Baley,
I may suggest we seek immediate cover!

162
00:12:56,892 --> 00:12:58,120
Where am I?

163
00:12:58,948 --> 00:13:00,651
What the hell happened?

164
00:13:02,707 --> 00:13:04,387
Welcome Captain Zoom.

165
00:13:04,523 --> 00:13:06,373
You're on the planet Pangea.

166
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:08,670
I'm sorry I had to bring you
here without warning, but,

167
00:13:08,740 --> 00:13:11,404
I need you to save my
sister and her civilization.

168
00:13:11,447 --> 00:13:14,342
Didn't we do this episode
in the first season?

169
00:13:16,785 --> 00:13:18,020
Wait...

170
00:13:19,066 --> 00:13:20,555
how did I get here?

171
00:13:20,585 --> 00:13:24,002
Well, it was a cinch
to fold time and space,

172
00:13:24,258 --> 00:13:27,148
and use your carrier wave to
guide my transportation beam,

173
00:13:27,289 --> 00:13:32,199
but the only hard part was reconfiguring
your brain waves so we could communicate.

174
00:13:32,747 --> 00:13:35,954
I know what's going on here.

175
00:13:36,473 --> 00:13:38,784
I'm on "This Is Your Life."

176
00:13:39,259 --> 00:13:43,374
Where's Ralph Edwards?
Ralph, get out here.

177
00:13:43,562 --> 00:13:45,644
Where are you, ya old dog?

178
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:48,702
Ralph?

179
00:13:48,851 --> 00:13:52,026
We heard an explosion.
Who's Mr. Fancy Pants?

180
00:13:52,128 --> 00:13:55,672
Put your weapons down.
This is Captain Zoom.

181
00:13:55,733 --> 00:13:58,043
I brought him here to help us save Tyra.

182
00:13:58,457 --> 00:14:00,291
Is this true?

183
00:14:00,387 --> 00:14:04,311
No, I'm not Captain Zoom. I'm Ty Farrell.

184
00:14:04,893 --> 00:14:08,538
Maybe you read about my Oberon in "A Midsummer
Night's Dream" at the Hartford Playhouse?

185
00:14:08,557 --> 00:14:11,564
It was summer stock but most of
the New York papers covered it.

186
00:14:11,702 --> 00:14:13,654
Ty Farrell, the actor?

187
00:14:14,379 --> 00:14:16,251
What's an actor?

188
00:14:16,530 --> 00:14:18,793
You know, I act.

189
00:14:19,390 --> 00:14:21,434
I pretend I'm somebody else for money.

190
00:14:21,472 --> 00:14:24,250
Ah, so you're a spy. Kill him.

191
00:14:24,285 --> 00:14:27,116
Whoa, hey hey hey,
listen just a second, fellas.

192
00:14:27,217 --> 00:14:30,407
Now look, I don't know what I've done, I don't
know who you are, I don't know where I am,

193
00:14:30,421 --> 00:14:32,513
but you just can't up and kill me.

194
00:14:32,536 --> 00:14:33,909
Uh, sure we can.

195
00:14:34,287 --> 00:14:36,645
Ah, you, you've passed the test.

196
00:14:37,538 --> 00:14:38,533
Test?

197
00:14:38,678 --> 00:14:40,029
Yes, ah...

198
00:14:40,943 --> 00:14:43,087
I am, Captain Zoom,

199
00:14:43,186 --> 00:14:44,647
and I just...

200
00:14:44,793 --> 00:14:48,911
wanted to be sure that I could trust you,
with my secret identity.

201
00:14:55,249 --> 00:14:56,821
That's Pangea.

202
00:14:57,542 --> 00:14:59,533
No, it's 100% cotton.

203
00:15:23,228 --> 00:15:25,419
I thought I might find you here.

204
00:15:25,475 --> 00:15:31,297
Given the fact these are my chambers I doubt if
it was much of a strain on your psychic powers.

205
00:15:36,489 --> 00:15:40,858
I've come to take your mind
off that, Pangean whore.

206
00:15:46,731 --> 00:15:49,191
Wouldn't you rather be with
one of your own kind?

207
00:15:49,231 --> 00:15:52,324
You're the high priestess of
our people. It'd be like...

208
00:15:52,646 --> 00:15:54,831
making love to my mother.

209
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:57,816
I never enjoyed that.

210
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:04,879
Vesper I've, reached a stalemate
with these Pangeans.

211
00:16:04,887 --> 00:16:10,657
Just when I think I have won they, disappear into
their jungles, eluding defeat for another day.

212
00:16:10,923 --> 00:16:14,670
Your psychic ability is the advantage
I need to crush them.

213
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:19,085
If you lose your... pureness,
you lose your powers.

214
00:16:20,324 --> 00:16:23,394
Can't risk that. I need to
take this world whole.

215
00:16:23,617 --> 00:16:25,510
I need Pangea.

216
00:16:26,688 --> 00:16:30,359
Your needs,
we're always talking about your needs.

217
00:16:30,510 --> 00:16:31,976
What about my needs?

218
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,348
The answer is "no."

219
00:16:33,388 --> 00:16:34,808
How long do I have to wait?

220
00:16:34,833 --> 00:16:37,374
Till the next priestess is old enough
to take your place.

221
00:16:37,389 --> 00:16:40,037
She's only three and a half!

222
00:16:42,563 --> 00:16:44,749
What does it mean, what do you see?

223
00:16:45,653 --> 00:16:46,936
I see...

224
00:16:47,381 --> 00:16:48,936
I see...

225
00:16:51,607 --> 00:16:55,083
I see a new man among the rebels.

226
00:16:57,142 --> 00:16:59,547
He has defeated many enemies.

227
00:17:00,528 --> 00:17:02,986
He's a hero to millions.

228
00:17:05,488 --> 00:17:07,699
What else do you see? Tell me.

229
00:17:09,329 --> 00:17:11,397
His name is Captain Zoom.

230
00:17:11,468 --> 00:17:13,910
He comes from a distant planet.

231
00:17:14,586 --> 00:17:16,365
He has great powers.

232
00:17:16,447 --> 00:17:18,270
Where does he get them from?

233
00:17:20,759 --> 00:17:21,854
Chocko...

234
00:17:23,287 --> 00:17:24,581
Socko.

235
00:17:27,178 --> 00:17:30,364
Who is this... Captain Zoom?

236
00:17:30,586 --> 00:17:32,346
Who is Lord Vox?

237
00:17:32,490 --> 00:17:34,541
Thousands of millennia ago,

238
00:17:34,581 --> 00:17:37,251
Zell, the terrestrial mother, and Gar,

239
00:17:37,283 --> 00:17:40,579
father of the cosmos gave birth
to Rhea, God among men.

240
00:17:40,608 --> 00:17:44,909
Wait, wait. This sounds long. Is
there a Reader's Digest version?

241
00:17:44,978 --> 00:17:49,171
Rhea, led this planet
into its first golden age.

242
00:17:49,224 --> 00:17:51,244
But then the planet got sick.

243
00:17:51,299 --> 00:17:54,210
Thus began the time of
the great dispersion.

244
00:17:56,338 --> 00:17:58,388
All right, let me make it simple for you.

245
00:17:58,409 --> 00:18:01,564
A lot of people who
used to live here, left.

246
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:05,757
But, you still haven't answered
my question, who is Lord Vox?

247
00:18:06,136 --> 00:18:08,470
His race is the Vectrons.

248
00:18:08,541 --> 00:18:13,244
Their ancestors were among those who
left Pangea thousands of centuries ago.

249
00:18:13,305 --> 00:18:16,895
He knows that this world,
the beginning of all life,

250
00:18:16,981 --> 00:18:20,766
is the key, to holding his power,
over his subjects.

251
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:23,799
For somewhere, on Pangea,

252
00:18:24,127 --> 00:18:27,433
lie the great secrets of the ancients.

253
00:18:27,473 --> 00:18:30,991
Thanks for the Sunday school lesson.
Now... Tyra,

254
00:18:31,185 --> 00:18:33,717
is a, prisoner of this Vox character?

255
00:18:33,749 --> 00:18:37,035
Yes, aboard the flagship
in orbit around the planet.

256
00:18:37,140 --> 00:18:39,477
Well, why don't you use your
spaceships to rescue her?

257
00:18:39,521 --> 00:18:43,583
We, uh... don't have any spaceships.

258
00:18:43,647 --> 00:18:47,999
Huh... and this, Vox has a
whole lot of soldiers, right?

259
00:18:48,060 --> 00:18:49,756
And many weapons.

260
00:18:49,913 --> 00:18:51,892
And, you don't have any spaceships,

261
00:18:51,907 --> 00:18:53,570
but you do have a handful of guys,

262
00:18:53,585 --> 00:18:56,205
a few guns, and a couple of horses,
right?

263
00:18:56,395 --> 00:18:58,267
We also have you.

264
00:18:58,513 --> 00:19:00,439
And our faith.

265
00:19:07,379 --> 00:19:08,528
Okay.

266
00:19:09,488 --> 00:19:11,090
I've given this a lot of thought,

267
00:19:11,130 --> 00:19:13,407
and I have a plan to save your leader.

268
00:19:13,454 --> 00:19:16,393
But it's a plan that requires
flawless execution,

269
00:19:16,482 --> 00:19:19,534
and since I,
only demand perfection for myself,

270
00:19:20,289 --> 00:19:22,350
I must go alone.

271
00:19:34,962 --> 00:19:37,212
There goes a brave man.

272
00:19:40,757 --> 00:19:43,236
Oh, I can't believe this.
What is going on?

273
00:19:43,307 --> 00:19:44,841
What did I do to deserve this?

274
00:19:44,868 --> 00:19:47,985
I'm going to talk to my agent,
first thing in the morning.

275
00:19:52,793 --> 00:19:57,122
How the hell did I end up on another
planet? I've never even been to Europe.

276
00:20:03,911 --> 00:20:06,516
Easy. Easy boy. Nice fella.

277
00:20:14,777 --> 00:20:15,814
Come on!

278
00:20:29,913 --> 00:20:30,949
Come on!

279
00:20:39,263 --> 00:20:43,523
Okay, she missed the episode,
where I defeated the Lizard King.

280
00:20:45,077 --> 00:20:46,829
Section one, stand by.

281
00:20:46,908 --> 00:20:48,003
Roger that.

282
00:20:50,471 --> 00:20:52,822
- Who are you guys?
- I am Lieutenant Zorg.

283
00:20:52,876 --> 00:20:55,309
Thank God, the police.

284
00:20:55,599 --> 00:20:57,013
What a day!

285
00:20:57,104 --> 00:20:59,771
First I'm stuck in makeup,
for 45 minutes,

286
00:20:59,788 --> 00:21:02,770
then these loony rebels,
zap me across the universe,

287
00:21:02,832 --> 00:21:06,577
and then the Loch Ness monster here
thinks I'm a shrimp cocktail and...

288
00:21:07,729 --> 00:21:09,927
Bring the big mouth to the ship.

289
00:21:28,139 --> 00:21:31,744
Be brave my brother, don't lose hope.

290
00:21:31,962 --> 00:21:33,117
Where are we?

291
00:21:33,183 --> 00:21:35,553
We're prisoners on Lord Vox's flagship.

292
00:21:35,706 --> 00:21:39,635
Oh God, no, no, please no.

293
00:21:40,247 --> 00:21:41,486
Are you a warrior?

294
00:21:41,589 --> 00:21:44,444
No, I'm Ty Farrell, the actor.

295
00:21:45,902 --> 00:21:48,610
Somebody who pretends to be
somebody else for money.

296
00:21:48,634 --> 00:21:51,109
So that's it, you're a spy for Lord Vox.

297
00:21:51,188 --> 00:21:52,421
I'm not a spy.

298
00:21:52,445 --> 00:21:55,116
Hitchcock wouldn't even
see me for "Notorious."

299
00:21:55,233 --> 00:21:59,786
Well forget it, you'll never trick me into telling
you the whereabouts of the rebel camp.

300
00:21:59,849 --> 00:22:00,925
Rebel camp?

301
00:22:01,330 --> 00:22:02,697
- Are you Tyra?
- Yes,

302
00:22:02,775 --> 00:22:05,804
and if Vox kills me, my people will
find another ruler to lead them.

303
00:22:05,850 --> 00:22:07,154
That would be me.

304
00:22:08,850 --> 00:22:09,896
You?

305
00:22:10,536 --> 00:22:12,805
My people, chose you?

306
00:22:13,650 --> 00:22:15,305
I have to get home.

307
00:22:15,337 --> 00:22:16,716
Well that's fine with me.

308
00:22:16,915 --> 00:22:19,408
I mean I don't even know
what the hell happened.

309
00:22:19,494 --> 00:22:21,844
Seems like only yesterday I was...

310
00:22:21,901 --> 00:22:25,083
enjoying room service in my
suite at the Plaza Hotel.

311
00:22:25,757 --> 00:22:29,353
Complimentary champagne, chateaubriand.

312
00:22:29,502 --> 00:22:30,773
Alicia the night maid...

313
00:22:30,801 --> 00:22:32,434
Oh, I really feel for you.

314
00:22:32,473 --> 00:22:34,121
Personally, I wouldn't know what it feels

315
00:22:34,122 --> 00:22:35,713
like to give up such extravagances since

316
00:22:35,714 --> 00:22:37,195
I've spent my whole life engaged in a

317
00:22:37,228 --> 00:22:38,509
life or death struggle trying to

318
00:22:38,510 --> 00:22:40,493
preserve the homeland of my people.

319
00:22:40,494 --> 00:22:42,485
Gee, it's too bad that cute butt has such

320
00:22:42,486 --> 00:22:44,058
a big stick stuck up it.

321
00:22:44,082 --> 00:22:44,874
Oh, and I wanted

322
00:22:44,876 --> 00:22:46,090
so bad for you to like me.

323
00:22:46,092 --> 00:22:46,785
Listen lady, if

324
00:22:46,787 --> 00:22:48,467
it wasn't for you I
wouldn't even be here.

325
00:22:48,499 --> 00:22:49,595
I didn't bring you here.

326
00:22:49,655 --> 00:22:51,256
No, but your brother did, to rescue you.

327
00:22:51,257 --> 00:22:53,188
Kudos on a job well done.

328
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:56,705
You're here to kill him, right.

329
00:22:56,714 --> 00:22:57,709
Quiet!

330
00:22:59,611 --> 00:23:01,203
Hey, listen fellas I don't suppose it

331
00:23:01,205 --> 00:23:02,766
would make any difference if I told you

332
00:23:02,767 --> 00:23:04,230
that Vice President Nixon's kids

333
00:23:04,232 --> 00:23:06,462
are big fans of my show.

334
00:23:06,743 --> 00:23:09,212
Lord Vox wants to
personally interrogate you.

335
00:23:09,266 --> 00:23:14,676
And I'd love to, but I'm really trying
to limit my personal appearances...

336
00:23:15,315 --> 00:23:16,371
Thank you.

337
00:23:32,064 --> 00:23:34,839
Now, this just gets better and better.

338
00:23:39,113 --> 00:23:40,378
Hi.

339
00:23:41,307 --> 00:23:43,365
Listen, you look like a reasonable fella.

340
00:23:43,405 --> 00:23:45,550
What do I have to do to get out of here?

341
00:23:45,572 --> 00:23:48,115
Just, tell the truth.

342
00:23:52,039 --> 00:23:53,219
What's your name?

343
00:23:53,242 --> 00:23:54,389
Ty Farrell.

344
00:23:57,631 --> 00:24:00,166
I love the smell of burning flesh.

345
00:24:02,344 --> 00:24:03,727
That wasn't the truth.

346
00:24:03,910 --> 00:24:07,414
Okay, Ty Farrell's my stage name.

347
00:24:08,438 --> 00:24:10,489
My real name is...

348
00:24:11,186 --> 00:24:13,059
Eugene Oshovsky.

349
00:24:16,623 --> 00:24:21,634
And... where are you from... Eugene?

350
00:24:22,111 --> 00:24:23,486
Well I was...

351
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,955
born in Riverside, Iowa,
but I just recently signed a,

352
00:24:25,971 --> 00:24:28,353
lease for a small brownstone
off Sutton Place.

353
00:24:28,375 --> 00:24:30,045
You may have heard of
the previous owner,

354
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:32,607
the grand dame of American
theater, Helen Hayes.

355
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:38,879
I was telling the truth.

356
00:24:38,970 --> 00:24:42,435
I know, stop embellishing your answers.

357
00:24:45,973 --> 00:24:48,173
Where were you, trained?

358
00:24:50,284 --> 00:24:53,957
I took some night classes at the
Academy of Dramatic Arts.

359
00:24:54,009 --> 00:24:56,137
Is there another Captain Zoom?

360
00:24:56,426 --> 00:24:57,452
No.

361
00:25:01,144 --> 00:25:02,672
I'm sorry.

362
00:25:02,719 --> 00:25:06,858
I'm sorry. There are a couple of guys that
put on the suit for supermarket openings.

363
00:25:06,932 --> 00:25:08,684
But I do my own stunts.

364
00:25:10,193 --> 00:25:13,420
Okay, okay. Not all the time.

365
00:25:13,616 --> 00:25:15,254
I have a bad back.

366
00:25:17,145 --> 00:25:18,574
I didn't embellish.

367
00:25:18,628 --> 00:25:21,219
I know, I just don't like you.

368
00:25:40,964 --> 00:25:42,557
This is gonna be fun.

369
00:25:42,787 --> 00:25:44,307
For me too.

370
00:25:59,368 --> 00:26:02,165
Coach, you can't take me out now.

371
00:26:02,196 --> 00:26:05,939
My dad's out there and, he may not,
get to see me play again.

372
00:26:07,447 --> 00:26:10,239
No, he's not sick.
He's going on a cruise.

373
00:26:14,112 --> 00:26:15,913
Ah, Dr. Yal-Tem,

374
00:26:16,062 --> 00:26:18,373
and what did you find out
about his weapon?

375
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:19,644
It's a fake.

376
00:26:19,848 --> 00:26:20,832
See?

377
00:26:21,113 --> 00:26:23,075
All of his equipment's phony.

378
00:26:23,185 --> 00:26:25,941
But, we're still working on
cracking that code ring.

379
00:26:26,001 --> 00:26:28,642
This must be some cruel cosmic joke.

380
00:26:29,992 --> 00:26:30,987
Fry him.

381
00:26:31,057 --> 00:26:32,053
Fry him.

382
00:26:34,664 --> 00:26:37,941
Never, NEVER,
point anything at me.

383
00:26:42,442 --> 00:26:43,622
No wait!

384
00:26:43,887 --> 00:26:47,004
Don't destroy the prisoner yet.
I need to probe his mind.

385
00:26:47,020 --> 00:26:48,237
But Lord Vox ordered me...

386
00:26:48,245 --> 00:26:50,032
Listen, fathead!

387
00:26:50,166 --> 00:26:53,751
Are you going to question
the high priestess of Val?

388
00:26:54,429 --> 00:26:56,604
Now, have him taken to my chambers.

389
00:26:56,659 --> 00:26:58,768
Yes, High Priestess.

390
00:26:59,049 --> 00:27:00,496
With a little time,

391
00:27:00,543 --> 00:27:03,210
I will have the answers
to many mysteries.

392
00:27:03,243 --> 00:27:04,454
Mysteries...

393
00:27:15,033 --> 00:27:18,498
It was all a dream,
just a terrible dream.

394
00:27:19,870 --> 00:27:24,882
Now baby, I can't guarantee you a part on
the show, but they do like to keep me happy.

395
00:27:26,055 --> 00:27:27,102
What are you doing?

396
00:27:27,297 --> 00:27:28,924
I'm probing your mind.

397
00:27:29,090 --> 00:27:31,114
My minds up here sweetheart.

398
00:27:33,070 --> 00:27:35,609
What did you say your name was?

399
00:27:36,070 --> 00:27:37,353
I am Vesper.

400
00:27:37,681 --> 00:27:41,249
High priestess of the
Psychic Sisters of Val.

401
00:27:41,507 --> 00:27:43,997
Sorceress of the Vectron Order.

402
00:27:44,433 --> 00:27:48,235
Who's apparently hornyer
than a rhinoceros herd.

403
00:27:49,601 --> 00:27:54,187
I can't do this, mustn't do this,
it is the law.

404
00:27:54,322 --> 00:27:58,765
I have a responsibility to
my people, my religion.

405
00:27:58,814 --> 00:28:00,143
You Catholic too?

406
00:28:00,252 --> 00:28:03,700
Ah, the hell with it. Yes, yes, Yes!

407
00:28:28,819 --> 00:28:31,930
You got another cigarette,
I like to smoke afterwards, too.

408
00:28:37,103 --> 00:28:38,418
Vesper?

409
00:28:40,669 --> 00:28:41,575
My...

410
00:28:41,654 --> 00:28:42,755
my...

411
00:28:43,388 --> 00:28:44,959
psychic powers...

412
00:28:45,669 --> 00:28:47,068
no...

413
00:28:47,903 --> 00:28:49,122
no...

414
00:28:52,563 --> 00:28:55,439
You were ah, you were great, baby.

415
00:28:58,513 --> 00:28:59,748
I'll call you.

416
00:29:18,221 --> 00:29:19,221
Hey!

417
00:29:19,370 --> 00:29:21,214
Guards, guards!

418
00:29:22,876 --> 00:29:24,298
Let me go.

419
00:29:28,018 --> 00:29:30,155
- Shut up ya little runt.
- Let me go.

420
00:29:35,042 --> 00:29:37,034
Not the face, not the face!

421
00:29:37,152 --> 00:29:38,826
Oh please.

422
00:29:39,472 --> 00:29:41,836
Come on, we gotta get out of here.

423
00:29:46,143 --> 00:29:48,235
Keep moving, prisoner.

424
00:29:54,105 --> 00:29:55,308
Halt!

425
00:29:55,932 --> 00:29:56,831
State your business.

426
00:29:56,846 --> 00:29:59,109
This sniveling coward is going
to lead us to the rebels.

427
00:29:59,131 --> 00:30:01,291
I'm to put him on the ship
and await Lord Vox.

428
00:30:01,314 --> 00:30:02,869
I was not informed of this.

429
00:30:02,883 --> 00:30:04,444
Don't you want to capture the rebels?

430
00:30:04,467 --> 00:30:05,876
Yes, yes!

431
00:30:05,970 --> 00:30:10,392
I will bring Val to the rebels for
I have waited my whole life,

432
00:30:10,584 --> 00:30:14,871
to see these impudent turncoats
brought to justice.

433
00:30:15,062 --> 00:30:16,067
Wait here.

434
00:30:16,171 --> 00:30:20,732
My whole life, dost thou hear?

435
00:30:20,856 --> 00:30:22,440
I heard.

436
00:30:23,297 --> 00:30:24,710
What the hell was that?

437
00:30:24,794 --> 00:30:26,669
It's acting, it's what I do.

438
00:30:26,711 --> 00:30:27,950
Well, you do it badly.

439
00:30:27,972 --> 00:30:31,911
- Trouble on the main hanger deck.
- They're rebels, seize them!

440
00:30:36,944 --> 00:30:38,631
I'm commin', I'm commin'!

441
00:30:45,094 --> 00:30:46,540
Come on!

442
00:30:46,946 --> 00:30:49,680
Hit the red auto drive
button on the right.

443
00:30:51,113 --> 00:30:52,057
I said to the right!

444
00:30:52,069 --> 00:30:53,668
Is that my right or
camera right?

445
00:30:53,688 --> 00:30:56,081
I'll hold them off.
You get us out of here.

446
00:31:18,127 --> 00:31:20,424
Tyra, where's the clutch?

447
00:31:20,966 --> 00:31:23,080
Just hold it steady.

448
00:31:27,227 --> 00:31:29,042
Excuse me my lord.

449
00:31:29,802 --> 00:31:32,708
I thought I told you never to interrupt
me, when I was in conference.

450
00:31:32,721 --> 00:31:35,561
Yes sir, but the prisoners have escaped.

451
00:31:40,188 --> 00:31:41,150
Tyra!

452
00:31:41,152 --> 00:31:42,706
I'm a little busy!

453
00:31:53,349 --> 00:31:54,630
Much better.

454
00:31:58,098 --> 00:31:59,763
This is way too easy.

455
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,029
Fire!

456
00:32:08,197 --> 00:32:10,397
Whoa, this guy's good.

457
00:32:18,357 --> 00:32:20,677
We're being pursued.
Energize the pulse ray emitter.

458
00:32:20,679 --> 00:32:22,774
Is that like turning on my high beams?

459
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:24,309
Get up, get up!

460
00:32:27,665 --> 00:32:29,795
Sit down and start shooting.

461
00:32:30,926 --> 00:32:33,032
Now, this, I can do!

462
00:32:33,063 --> 00:32:36,443
I played a tail gunner in "Desperate Journey"
starring Errol Flynn and Ronald Reagan.

463
00:32:36,468 --> 00:32:38,936
It was a small part but it
did a lot for my career.

464
00:32:38,946 --> 00:32:40,549
Shut up and fight.

465
00:33:01,317 --> 00:33:03,265
Hey, I nailed him.

466
00:33:05,810 --> 00:33:07,612
We're targeted.

467
00:33:09,343 --> 00:33:11,892
Don't worry, I got him
right where I want him.

468
00:33:11,923 --> 00:33:15,283
Stand up proud now bad boy.

469
00:33:15,309 --> 00:33:16,782
Come on, hurry up.

470
00:33:16,784 --> 00:33:18,836
Say good night, Pangean scum.

471
00:33:21,381 --> 00:33:22,875
Fire!

472
00:33:52,424 --> 00:33:53,254
Come on.

473
00:33:53,269 --> 00:33:55,578
We gotta put some distance
between us and that escape pod.

474
00:33:55,580 --> 00:33:57,882
Lady, I'm getting a little tired
of you bossing me around.

475
00:33:57,884 --> 00:33:58,623
Listen to me,

476
00:33:58,625 --> 00:34:00,065
it'll be very easy for them to track

477
00:34:00,066 --> 00:34:01,272
down that pod. Now, move it.

478
00:34:01,286 --> 00:34:02,269
Don't push me.

479
00:34:02,369 --> 00:34:04,401
I've had a terrible day and my analyst

480
00:34:04,432 --> 00:34:06,489
is in another solar system.

481
00:34:08,979 --> 00:34:11,066
You hold them off. I'll go get help.

482
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:17,683
Mommy!

483
00:34:23,161 --> 00:34:25,207
Hey, stay where you are!

484
00:34:26,585 --> 00:34:28,380
Okay, okay, I'm innocent.

485
00:34:28,552 --> 00:34:30,825
Wonder Woman here took me prisoner.

486
00:34:36,087 --> 00:34:37,517
Go go!

487
00:34:41,491 --> 00:34:42,577
Hold it!

488
00:34:53,934 --> 00:34:55,162
Now what?

489
00:34:55,200 --> 00:34:57,707
My ankle, I think it's broken.

490
00:34:59,485 --> 00:35:00,739
You better go on without me.

491
00:35:01,293 --> 00:35:02,212
Okay.

492
00:35:02,236 --> 00:35:03,286
Wait!

493
00:35:03,683 --> 00:35:05,798
You can't just leave me here.

494
00:35:07,222 --> 00:35:08,676
Come on...

495
00:35:09,091 --> 00:35:10,818
come on, come on.

496
00:35:11,402 --> 00:35:13,625
Come, come on!

497
00:35:24,456 --> 00:35:25,820
They're coming.

498
00:35:26,179 --> 00:35:27,594
They're coming!

499
00:35:34,479 --> 00:35:37,525
Hail Captain Zoom.
He saved our beloved Tyra.

500
00:35:40,161 --> 00:35:41,754
Zoom, Zoom, Zoom,

501
00:35:41,831 --> 00:35:43,112
Zoom, Zoom, Zoom,

502
00:35:43,161 --> 00:35:44,661
Zoom, Zoom, Zoom,

503
00:35:44,766 --> 00:35:46,118
Zoom, Zoom, Zoom,

504
00:35:46,175 --> 00:35:47,582
Zoom, Zoom, Zoom.

505
00:35:51,511 --> 00:35:54,657
This is a great day for Pangea.

506
00:35:54,698 --> 00:35:58,600
The evil plans of Lord Vox
have been thwarted,

507
00:35:58,601 --> 00:35:59,934
thanks solely,

508
00:36:00,028 --> 00:36:04,424
to the heroic efforts, of a
stranger from another time,

509
00:36:04,655 --> 00:36:06,446
Captain Zoom.

510
00:36:14,060 --> 00:36:14,951
Zoom, Zoom.

511
00:36:20,232 --> 00:36:21,599
Well...

512
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:25,341
first I'd just like to say that...

513
00:36:25,888 --> 00:36:27,701
I didn't do it alone.

514
00:36:27,914 --> 00:36:30,842
There really is another
person I have to thank,

515
00:36:31,487 --> 00:36:34,563
the great acting teacher Lee Strasberg.

516
00:36:34,754 --> 00:36:37,508
And even though I wasn't
accepted into his program,

517
00:36:37,610 --> 00:36:40,896
I still remember his credo;

518
00:36:42,002 --> 00:36:47,010
observe, listen, and
react, spontaneously.

519
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,947
And I'm sure you'll
all agree that today...

520
00:36:51,823 --> 00:36:53,723
I passed the course.

521
00:36:57,536 --> 00:36:58,624
So...

522
00:36:59,640 --> 00:37:03,938
I, uh, hate to eat and run but
I really need to get back.

523
00:37:04,056 --> 00:37:06,074
Uh, what time does my flight leave?

524
00:37:06,113 --> 00:37:08,505
Um... Captain Zoom...

525
00:37:09,451 --> 00:37:11,779
I can't send you home right away.

526
00:37:11,941 --> 00:37:14,226
You see, when I brought you here,

527
00:37:14,308 --> 00:37:16,468
I used up all the xenon isotopes.

528
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:21,996
And, it takes time for the new ones to decay,
to the necessary level of radioactivity.

529
00:37:22,194 --> 00:37:24,185
Great, I have time for dessert.

530
00:37:24,834 --> 00:37:27,129
So when are these isotopes
going to be ready?

531
00:37:27,186 --> 00:37:30,330
In about... 12 million years.

532
00:37:48,498 --> 00:37:50,812
Um, Captain Zoom?

533
00:37:51,607 --> 00:37:54,995
You know I was just wondering
which one of those stars...

534
00:37:55,178 --> 00:37:56,531
is home?

535
00:37:57,953 --> 00:38:00,716
Actually it's, that one.

536
00:38:02,671 --> 00:38:04,936
You know fate's a funny thing kid.

537
00:38:05,139 --> 00:38:06,230
What do you mean?

538
00:38:06,269 --> 00:38:10,807
Well, before I became Captain Zoom, I was
just another chiseled profile in the crowd,

539
00:38:11,320 --> 00:38:13,859
an out-of-work actor with big dreams

540
00:38:13,892 --> 00:38:18,217
just about to give up and go back into my
dad's aluminum siding business when,

541
00:38:18,404 --> 00:38:20,599
fate intervened.

542
00:38:21,541 --> 00:38:26,497
The wife of a Chocko Socko executive saw
me with my shirt off cleaning a pool and...

543
00:38:26,954 --> 00:38:29,585
before I know it I was a household name.

544
00:38:30,094 --> 00:38:31,653
Now look at me.

545
00:38:33,179 --> 00:38:35,882
Seems like fate just
can't leave me alone.

546
00:38:35,979 --> 00:38:37,793
I'm sorry captain.

547
00:38:37,828 --> 00:38:39,276
It's okay kid.

548
00:38:39,964 --> 00:38:43,449
At least I don't have the
IRS on my back anymore.

549
00:38:44,469 --> 00:38:49,580
But I do feel sorry for all the folks back
on the show probably just lost their jobs.

550
00:38:49,752 --> 00:38:51,088
Without me...

551
00:38:52,056 --> 00:38:54,032
there is no Captain Zoom.

552
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:58,885
Smoking rockets, this new face will
surely fool your enemies, Captain Zoom.

553
00:39:00,966 --> 00:39:03,650
That's right, Happy.

554
00:39:08,194 --> 00:39:12,415
Sometimes the Gods let
us carry the full weight,

555
00:39:12,549 --> 00:39:14,292
of the choices we make.

556
00:39:14,644 --> 00:39:19,271
I was hoping that a power much larger than
myself might share in the decision to surrender.

557
00:39:19,406 --> 00:39:20,791
Why surrender?

558
00:39:21,139 --> 00:39:25,107
For the first time in years,
the people of Pangea, have hope.

559
00:39:25,180 --> 00:39:26,820
But it's a false hope.

560
00:39:27,054 --> 00:39:31,311
When I was aboard Vox's ship,
I saw his armies, his determination.

561
00:39:31,608 --> 00:39:35,029
He won't give up and
we're totally outmatched.

562
00:39:36,235 --> 00:39:38,099
It's suicide to go on.

563
00:39:38,937 --> 00:39:39,985
Tyra.

564
00:39:41,815 --> 00:39:46,040
I remember a problem your
father faced, similar to this.

565
00:39:46,672 --> 00:39:49,308
Vox had only just arrived back then,

566
00:39:49,436 --> 00:39:52,701
and your father thought that
surrender was inevitable.

567
00:39:52,898 --> 00:39:55,129
Why did he decide to fight?

568
00:39:56,683 --> 00:39:58,826
You were born...

569
00:39:59,749 --> 00:40:05,795
and he couldn't bear the thought of his
little girl, enduring a life of slavery.

570
00:40:08,424 --> 00:40:10,254
Yes, well,

571
00:40:11,624 --> 00:40:13,913
there might have been hope then.

572
00:40:14,421 --> 00:40:16,562
Now there isn't.

573
00:40:17,504 --> 00:40:20,180
Yes, there is.

574
00:40:22,577 --> 00:40:25,062
Prophecy is being fulfilled.

575
00:40:25,173 --> 00:40:28,279
Pangea's new golden age is beginning.

576
00:40:28,406 --> 00:40:30,195
The signs are clear.

577
00:40:31,483 --> 00:40:32,515
What signs?

578
00:40:32,929 --> 00:40:35,954
The arrival of the Promised One.

579
00:40:41,470 --> 00:40:44,391
Him? You can't be serious.

580
00:40:44,477 --> 00:40:46,278
Prophecy says...

581
00:40:47,102 --> 00:40:50,896
he will come from afar
wearing the symbol of Pangea.

582
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:55,978
It is written, he will make
our enemies his enemies.

583
00:40:57,893 --> 00:40:59,702
I don't know Sagan.

584
00:41:00,021 --> 00:41:03,185
And with the arrival of the Promised One,

585
00:41:03,526 --> 00:41:06,257
we will find the lost temple of Rhea,

586
00:41:06,334 --> 00:41:10,672
and there will our destiny be fulfilled.

587
00:41:15,816 --> 00:41:19,528
I find it hard to believe
he is our savior.

588
00:41:20,277 --> 00:41:22,809
You must have faith.

589
00:41:33,571 --> 00:41:35,508
How's it goin' up there?

590
00:41:40,811 --> 00:41:43,662
How could I have been so easily fooled?

591
00:41:46,115 --> 00:41:50,390
Captain Zoom is, obviously more dangerous
than I ever imagined.

592
00:41:51,044 --> 00:41:52,378
Why are you smiling?

593
00:41:52,410 --> 00:41:53,787
Am I smiling?

594
00:41:54,550 --> 00:41:56,261
I didn't realize.

595
00:41:56,598 --> 00:41:58,171
It must be because of...

596
00:41:58,624 --> 00:42:01,889
my new vision, yes.

597
00:42:02,650 --> 00:42:05,423
I see... I see...

598
00:42:05,461 --> 00:42:07,162
What, what do you see?

599
00:42:07,247 --> 00:42:10,084
It's coming, it's coming. Don't rush me!

600
00:42:11,389 --> 00:42:13,437
Oh, I see it now.

601
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:15,062
It's crystal clear.

602
00:42:15,497 --> 00:42:18,178
Oh, Lord Vox, you're really gonna hit the
jackpot on this one.

603
00:42:18,202 --> 00:42:21,351
Will we... kill many rebels?

604
00:42:21,467 --> 00:42:22,801
And how.

605
00:42:24,046 --> 00:42:27,712
I see many bodies,
strewn across the ground,

606
00:42:27,766 --> 00:42:31,430
smoking, charred, from the relentless
blaster fire.

607
00:42:32,630 --> 00:42:34,581
Yes, yes, I love it!

608
00:42:34,879 --> 00:42:35,916
Go on.

609
00:42:35,962 --> 00:42:37,068
Go on?

610
00:42:39,261 --> 00:42:44,014
Smoking from the fire,
bodies, charred, strewn.

611
00:42:44,120 --> 00:42:47,047
What about, Captain Zoom?

612
00:42:48,813 --> 00:42:50,969
You will easily defeat him yourself,

613
00:42:51,017 --> 00:42:52,831
in hand-to-hand combat,

614
00:42:52,887 --> 00:42:55,854
and hold his severed head up in triumph.

615
00:42:56,917 --> 00:43:00,064
Good. Very good.

616
00:43:00,550 --> 00:43:02,484
I thought so.

617
00:43:03,965 --> 00:43:05,015
My lord...

618
00:43:05,781 --> 00:43:08,583
- we located the rebel camp.
- Excellent!

619
00:43:08,638 --> 00:43:13,380
Send four legions to the location immediately,
but have them wait for my command.

620
00:43:13,525 --> 00:43:18,275
I want a front row seat,
for the apocalypse.

621
00:43:19,184 --> 00:43:21,171
* Buffalo gal,
won't you come out tonight, *

622
00:43:21,195 --> 00:43:23,767
* won't you come out tonight,
won't you come out tonight, *

623
00:43:23,817 --> 00:43:29,007
* buffalo gal *
* won't you come out tonight. *

624
00:43:29,517 --> 00:43:32,902
* la la la la la *

625
00:43:35,256 --> 00:43:36,988
Don't worry, I didn't see anything.

626
00:43:36,989 --> 00:43:39,936
Oh, we can fix that.
Why don't you join me?

627
00:43:39,999 --> 00:43:42,968
We're leaving on a dangerous mission
to find the lost temple of Rhea,

628
00:43:42,973 --> 00:43:45,507
and we have no idea whether we're
going to make it back alive.

629
00:43:45,532 --> 00:43:47,062
Well, send me a postcard.

630
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:49,007
Vox is going to be furious
about our escape

631
00:43:49,009 --> 00:43:51,607
and he's going to send
everything he has after us.

632
00:43:51,744 --> 00:43:54,290
You won't be safe here for long.

633
00:43:54,334 --> 00:43:59,129
And how much safer am I going to be in the woods
with you and your little road company of Brigadoon.

634
00:43:59,144 --> 00:44:02,822
All right, if you would rather spend the rest
of your life living here on Pangea in fear

635
00:44:02,830 --> 00:44:06,020
and never see your precious
Plaza Hotel again,

636
00:44:06,215 --> 00:44:08,114
it's fine with me.

637
00:44:11,035 --> 00:44:13,808
Wait, wait, wait wait wait.
What do you mean?

638
00:44:13,998 --> 00:44:16,113
Well, Sagan told me that
in the temple of Rhea,

639
00:44:16,121 --> 00:44:18,528
we will most certainly find
a way to get you home.

640
00:44:18,583 --> 00:44:19,624
Home?

641
00:44:19,970 --> 00:44:23,207
New York? Cheesecake at Lindy's?

642
00:44:23,497 --> 00:44:24,383
Is this a trick?

643
00:44:24,433 --> 00:44:26,833
Maybe where you come from
people resort to lies and trickery

644
00:44:26,856 --> 00:44:29,593
to bend the will of others,
but that is not the Pangean way.

645
00:44:29,609 --> 00:44:34,404
Sorry, sorry, just give me five minutes
to run a comb through my hair.

646
00:44:57,176 --> 00:44:59,020
Search the camp.

647
00:45:03,780 --> 00:45:05,527
Nothing yet, Lieutenant Zorg.

648
00:45:05,551 --> 00:45:07,027
Come on men, keep looking.

649
00:45:07,724 --> 00:45:09,238
The place is deserted.

650
00:45:11,309 --> 00:45:12,822
Here he comes.

651
00:45:16,168 --> 00:45:18,995
Bring me Captain Zoom!

652
00:45:23,575 --> 00:45:26,105
A clean getaway, and no one got hurt.

653
00:45:26,360 --> 00:45:28,649
Not a bad plan, if I do say so myself.

654
00:45:28,664 --> 00:45:30,668
It was truly inspired, Captain.

655
00:45:30,715 --> 00:45:34,249
I thought so. Don't you agree,
Tyra that my plan was inspired?

656
00:45:34,257 --> 00:45:35,078
Yes, brilliant.

657
00:45:35,086 --> 00:45:37,588
I just hope it bought our people
enough time to go into hiding.

658
00:45:37,597 --> 00:45:41,700
Oh, don't worry. It worked for me and Happy,
we were trapped on that planet full of Amazons.

659
00:45:41,713 --> 00:45:46,763
The evil Empress Cleomanche was so busy looking for a
stolen ship she didn't even notice the slave girls escaping.

660
00:45:46,765 --> 00:45:48,850
That sounds like an exciting
adventure, Captain.

661
00:45:48,873 --> 00:45:53,356
Are you kidding? All those broads in
loincloths, it was a smorgasbord.

662
00:45:57,645 --> 00:46:00,026
I saw you burn down the camp.

663
00:46:00,050 --> 00:46:01,768
It was just as I pictured it.

664
00:46:01,866 --> 00:46:03,353
It was deserted.

665
00:46:03,416 --> 00:46:05,500
And they stole another one of my ships!

666
00:46:05,516 --> 00:46:07,430
I knew it. I saw that, too.

667
00:46:07,594 --> 00:46:10,508
You said you saw many dead rebels.

668
00:46:10,695 --> 00:46:14,005
You told me I would hold up the
severed head of Captain Zoom.

669
00:46:14,038 --> 00:46:15,933
I don't remember giving
you a time and a place.

670
00:46:15,942 --> 00:46:18,638
How you interpret my
visions is your problem.

671
00:46:19,090 --> 00:46:20,606
Vesper!

672
00:46:24,577 --> 00:46:27,842
You said when you tried
to probe Zoom's mind,

673
00:46:27,858 --> 00:46:30,729
he knocked you out, then escaped.

674
00:46:31,388 --> 00:46:32,841
That's right.

675
00:46:34,526 --> 00:46:37,929
He broke free of my mind hold
and knocked me out.

676
00:46:38,031 --> 00:46:41,534
Then he said if I, if I tried
to follow him he'd kill me.

677
00:46:43,780 --> 00:46:46,611
Of course, I wouldn't know he said
that if he'd knocked me out, but...

678
00:46:46,627 --> 00:46:50,083
I have a Fansian coin
in one of my hands.

679
00:46:50,282 --> 00:46:51,675
Tell me which one.

680
00:46:57,803 --> 00:46:58,975
Left.

681
00:47:01,672 --> 00:47:03,702
Well done, Vesper.

682
00:47:03,922 --> 00:47:05,957
Shall we go for two out of three?

683
00:47:06,139 --> 00:47:08,590
This is insane. I'm not gonna stand here

684
00:47:08,610 --> 00:47:10,282
and waste the precious gift given to me

685
00:47:10,299 --> 00:47:11,792
by the great God Val on some

686
00:47:11,813 --> 00:47:13,407
stupid carnival trick.

687
00:47:15,474 --> 00:47:17,500
The coins in your right hand.

688
00:47:19,241 --> 00:47:21,412
It is one thing to betray religion,

689
00:47:21,474 --> 00:47:23,285
to betray your race.

690
00:47:25,105 --> 00:47:27,264
It is another thing to betray me.

691
00:47:28,656 --> 00:47:32,049
I had the privilege alone
to take your power from you.

692
00:47:32,725 --> 00:47:34,683
To give it up for this...

693
00:47:34,918 --> 00:47:37,645
insignificant meddler.

694
00:47:40,562 --> 00:47:42,374
You've got more time.

695
00:47:44,196 --> 00:47:46,188
You shall pay.

696
00:47:49,441 --> 00:47:51,700
According to legend, the temple of Rhea's

697
00:47:51,717 --> 00:47:53,887
in the hidden valley of the ancients.

698
00:47:53,932 --> 00:47:55,229
Okay, where's that?

699
00:47:55,286 --> 00:47:56,557
It isn't on the map.

700
00:47:56,607 --> 00:47:59,120
That's why they call it
the hidden valley.

701
00:47:59,261 --> 00:48:01,971
The temple was guarded
by the gatekeepers.

702
00:48:02,056 --> 00:48:06,315
Prophecy says,
only the Promised One can gain access.

703
00:48:06,505 --> 00:48:09,779
But if it's hidden
how are we going to find it?

704
00:48:11,046 --> 00:48:12,817
There's something directly in our path.

705
00:48:12,839 --> 00:48:14,631
It's Lord Vox. He's found us.

706
00:48:14,670 --> 00:48:17,444
No, it's not Vox. It's an escape pod.

707
00:48:17,506 --> 00:48:19,399
And there's a distress signal
coming from it.

708
00:48:19,405 --> 00:48:21,588
- Bring it aboard.
- It could be a trap.

709
00:48:21,643 --> 00:48:22,657
Leave it alone.

710
00:48:22,681 --> 00:48:25,589
Sensors indicate there is
a female life form aboard.

711
00:48:25,732 --> 00:48:26,798
Bring it aboard.

712
00:48:35,791 --> 00:48:37,188
One move and you're dust.

713
00:48:37,238 --> 00:48:38,318
Oh, please.

714
00:48:40,371 --> 00:48:41,698
Zoom!

715
00:48:42,350 --> 00:48:45,771
Oh, I thought I'd never see you again.

716
00:48:45,772 --> 00:48:46,733
You know him?

717
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:47,903
Know him?

718
00:48:50,630 --> 00:48:52,944
Everybody, this is high priestess Vesper.

719
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,791
Vesper this is everybody.

720
00:48:55,390 --> 00:48:57,780
The high priestess of Val,

721
00:48:57,879 --> 00:49:00,986
the spiritual leader of Vox's hordes?

722
00:49:01,066 --> 00:49:04,411
Her deadly sorcery is an abomination
to our beliefs.

723
00:49:04,450 --> 00:49:07,357
See, she wears the Vectron amulet.

724
00:49:07,439 --> 00:49:11,416
It is written, this dark witch must die.

725
00:49:11,767 --> 00:49:13,811
Take a pill old woman.

726
00:49:13,891 --> 00:49:16,997
I've been banished by Vox,
stripped of my position,

727
00:49:16,998 --> 00:49:18,829
cast out of my religion. My past is

728
00:49:18,830 --> 00:49:22,114
meaningless, my future uncertain.
I have nothing.

729
00:49:22,864 --> 00:49:25,555
But that doesn't matter,
cause now I have you.

730
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:29,112
She's lying.
According to the laws of Vox's religion,

731
00:49:29,136 --> 00:49:32,631
the only way he could banish her is if
she had forsaken her psychic powers,

732
00:49:32,691 --> 00:49:35,272
and the only way that could happen
is if she...

733
00:49:38,702 --> 00:49:40,452
I'm tossing her out the airlock.

734
00:49:40,478 --> 00:49:43,798
Go ahead, but I could help you
find the temple of Rhea.

735
00:49:43,924 --> 00:49:46,147
That is where you're going, isn't it?

736
00:49:46,204 --> 00:49:47,494
How did you know that?

737
00:49:47,572 --> 00:49:49,292
I used to have powers.

738
00:49:49,343 --> 00:49:50,943
Years ago I had a vision,

739
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,242
a vision about the
gatekeepers to the temple.

740
00:49:53,268 --> 00:49:54,855
What was your vision?

741
00:49:55,035 --> 00:49:57,823
That they live near the
sulfur springs of Brunia.

742
00:49:58,418 --> 00:50:00,382
- She's bluffing.
- No.

743
00:50:00,570 --> 00:50:05,299
The sulfur springs of Brunia are
known only to the elders of Pangea.

744
00:50:05,424 --> 00:50:08,843
There's no way she could
even know their name.

745
00:50:08,914 --> 00:50:11,479
Unless you were telling the truth.

746
00:50:13,916 --> 00:50:15,127
You better be right.

747
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:19,111
Don't worry. We'll be in and out of that temple
before Vox even has a chance to find us.

748
00:50:19,204 --> 00:50:20,495
We found them.

749
00:50:20,542 --> 00:50:21,690
Well fire!

750
00:50:28,906 --> 00:50:30,244
We lost the main engine.

751
00:50:30,259 --> 00:50:31,265
We're going down!

752
00:50:31,281 --> 00:50:32,866
I knew we shouldn't have picked her up.

753
00:50:32,904 --> 00:50:34,300
Pull up! Pull up!

754
00:50:34,330 --> 00:50:35,685
We've got no power.

755
00:50:36,829 --> 00:50:40,514
Impact in - six - five - four - three

756
00:50:40,600 --> 00:50:43,703
two - one - impact!

757
00:50:44,525 --> 00:50:47,659
Good work. Lunch everybody.

758
00:50:56,149 --> 00:50:57,852
Well, can you do anything with it?

759
00:50:57,891 --> 00:51:00,436
Of course he can, he's a genius.

760
00:51:00,959 --> 00:51:02,834
I'll do my best but,

761
00:51:02,928 --> 00:51:05,678
I've got no spare parts,
none of the right tools,

762
00:51:05,741 --> 00:51:08,655
and the service manual's
in another language.

763
00:51:08,807 --> 00:51:10,784
You can start work in the morning.

764
00:51:10,815 --> 00:51:13,155
Here, get some rest.

765
00:51:13,171 --> 00:51:14,175
Thanks.

766
00:51:34,946 --> 00:51:37,150
You try sleeping next to me,
you won't wake up.

767
00:51:37,179 --> 00:51:40,124
Who said anything about sleeping?

768
00:51:40,363 --> 00:51:44,459
You know, it's comforting to know men are
exactly the same even across the galaxy.

769
00:51:44,619 --> 00:51:47,762
You, don't like me, do you?

770
00:51:48,727 --> 00:51:50,427
Oh, what's not to like?

771
00:51:50,474 --> 00:51:54,546
You're an unprincipled, self-centered jerk whose
main concern in life is how his hair looks.

772
00:51:54,585 --> 00:51:56,480
My hair does look good, doesn't it?

773
00:51:56,511 --> 00:51:57,291
Oh...

774
00:51:57,680 --> 00:51:58,930
You want me.

775
00:51:59,250 --> 00:52:01,221
It's written all over your face.

776
00:52:01,250 --> 00:52:04,880
I've seen your type before, you're just
like Betty Davis in "All About Eve."

777
00:52:04,914 --> 00:52:05,579
Pardon?

778
00:52:05,603 --> 00:52:08,849
Oh, hard on the outside, but inside,
scared and insecure.

779
00:52:08,883 --> 00:52:11,640
You're so busy being tough,
taking care of everybody else,

780
00:52:11,664 --> 00:52:15,238
- you never think about yourself.
- And that's all you think about.

781
00:52:16,092 --> 00:52:18,164
You talk about what a
great actor you are.

782
00:52:18,187 --> 00:52:20,640
Why don't you try acting like a leader.

783
00:52:21,707 --> 00:52:22,886
You know...

784
00:52:23,644 --> 00:52:26,825
I usually don't have to work
this hard with women.

785
00:52:28,957 --> 00:52:30,000
Look,

786
00:52:30,438 --> 00:52:34,304
I wish I was everything these people
think I am, but I am not a hero.

787
00:52:34,342 --> 00:52:36,217
I just play one on television.

788
00:52:36,506 --> 00:52:38,966
That shouldn't stop you from trying.

789
00:52:49,302 --> 00:52:50,357
So...

790
00:52:51,338 --> 00:52:52,813
where are you, bunking tonight?

791
00:52:54,754 --> 00:52:56,147
I don't think so.

792
00:53:14,514 --> 00:53:15,755
You guys going somewhere?

793
00:53:15,767 --> 00:53:17,538
Uh-huh, on a scouting mission.

794
00:53:17,610 --> 00:53:19,460
The sulfur springs are near here.

795
00:53:19,507 --> 00:53:22,705
Vesper recognizes the area
from her visions.

796
00:53:22,706 --> 00:53:24,907
Stimulus and I are going to be gone
for most of the day.

797
00:53:24,908 --> 00:53:26,454
We're taking the robot with us.

798
00:53:26,471 --> 00:53:27,844
I do have a name.

799
00:53:27,945 --> 00:53:30,004
I'm leaving you in charge.

800
00:53:30,153 --> 00:53:31,984
Think you can handle it?

801
00:53:32,178 --> 00:53:36,014
I managed a softball team for the
Broadway Show League for two summers.

802
00:53:36,048 --> 00:53:39,049
I think I can handle this.

803
00:53:48,011 --> 00:53:49,401
Sorry.

804
00:54:05,253 --> 00:54:08,419
We must be getting close,
I can smell the sulfur.

805
00:54:08,852 --> 00:54:10,265
Can you smell it, Stimulus.

806
00:54:10,288 --> 00:54:12,738
Yes, I wasn't going to say anything.

807
00:54:13,628 --> 00:54:16,350
Warning, warning, life forms approaching!

808
00:54:16,465 --> 00:54:17,535
Which direction?

809
00:54:17,557 --> 00:54:20,205
From all directions, 50 meters away.

810
00:54:26,422 --> 00:54:28,231
Why don't I see anything?

811
00:54:28,276 --> 00:54:31,809
Unknown, now 40 meters away
and still closing.

812
00:54:32,509 --> 00:54:33,649
35...

813
00:54:34,150 --> 00:54:35,243
30.

814
00:54:35,716 --> 00:54:36,870
They must be invisible.

815
00:54:36,912 --> 00:54:37,908
25.

816
00:54:38,269 --> 00:54:39,264
20.

817
00:54:40,404 --> 00:54:41,400
15.

818
00:54:43,534 --> 00:54:44,630
10 meters.

819
00:54:44,833 --> 00:54:46,050
I still don't see anything.

820
00:54:46,069 --> 00:54:46,705
Nine meters.

821
00:54:46,713 --> 00:54:47,413
Where are they?

822
00:54:47,421 --> 00:54:48,205
Eight,

823
00:54:48,420 --> 00:54:53,871
seven, six, five, four,
three, two meters!

824
00:54:53,923 --> 00:54:57,034
One meter, they're here, they're here!

825
00:54:59,812 --> 00:55:04,211
The crash must have messed up her
circuitry, she's clearly malfunctioning.

826
00:55:05,708 --> 00:55:06,285
Tyra!

827
00:55:06,298 --> 00:55:08,653
Somebody's got me. Grab hold of something

828
00:55:08,655 --> 00:55:10,187
What would you suggest?

829
00:55:10,386 --> 00:55:11,507
- Tyra!
- On your left!

830
00:55:11,536 --> 00:55:13,515
I told you there were life forms.

831
00:55:35,858 --> 00:55:37,458
Hurry up, kid.

832
00:55:38,289 --> 00:55:40,797
So, I guess you're not mad at me anymore.

833
00:55:40,812 --> 00:55:43,918
No,
not now that I have you all to myself.

834
00:55:44,432 --> 00:55:47,541
Look, Vesper, I don't want to give
you the wrong impression.

835
00:55:47,635 --> 00:55:49,317
We had some fun,
we shared some laughs.

836
00:55:49,332 --> 00:55:51,335
I gave up a sacred gift for you.

837
00:55:51,514 --> 00:55:54,723
And it's not that I don't appreciate
the sacrifice, it's just...

838
00:55:55,178 --> 00:55:57,821
I'm just not ready to
settle down with one...

839
00:55:58,032 --> 00:55:59,249
high priestess.

840
00:55:59,446 --> 00:56:02,054
What are you trying to say to me?

841
00:56:02,293 --> 00:56:04,149
Kid, how much longer is this gonna take?

842
00:56:04,173 --> 00:56:07,041
I was done a while ago,
I was just listening.

843
00:56:08,641 --> 00:56:11,986
Hey, somebody help me, anybody.

844
00:56:12,543 --> 00:56:15,033
What happened, Illumina?
Where's Tyra and Stimulus?

845
00:56:15,070 --> 00:56:16,743
I don't know. I can't remember.

846
00:56:16,784 --> 00:56:18,907
- Bailey, help me.
- What's wrong with her?

847
00:56:18,933 --> 00:56:21,641
She's had a sensory overload.
It's affected her memory bank.

848
00:56:21,643 --> 00:56:24,325
Well, just slap her on the back.
That's what I do with my TV.

849
00:56:24,333 --> 00:56:26,487
Illumina, try audio playback.

850
00:56:31,163 --> 00:56:32,307
That's Tyra.

851
00:56:32,373 --> 00:56:34,066
How would you know that?

852
00:56:34,087 --> 00:56:36,875
Oh, they're in trouble. What do we do?

853
00:56:36,937 --> 00:56:38,370
How can we find them, Bailey?

854
00:56:38,410 --> 00:56:41,753
I can reprogram Illumina's sensors, so she
can lead us to where they disappeared.

855
00:56:41,780 --> 00:56:43,811
Look, I don't want to end up dead.

856
00:56:43,855 --> 00:56:46,949
I say we should just let the kid fix
the rocket and let's get out of here.

857
00:56:46,974 --> 00:56:49,059
She's got a point.

858
00:56:50,160 --> 00:56:51,720
It is written,

859
00:56:51,863 --> 00:56:54,962
that if someone chooses to
live as a coward,

860
00:56:55,102 --> 00:56:56,911
he chooses not to live.

861
00:56:57,069 --> 00:57:02,357
It is also written that a certain old woman
with no fashion sense should butt out.

862
00:57:03,185 --> 00:57:04,577
We can't just give up.

863
00:57:04,578 --> 00:57:06,407
We have to at least try don't we?

864
00:57:06,422 --> 00:57:07,568
Listen Bailey,

865
00:57:07,686 --> 00:57:09,961
you want someone to entertain the troops,
I'm your man.

866
00:57:10,025 --> 00:57:12,640
But leading rescue missions,
fighting alien hordes,

867
00:57:12,663 --> 00:57:14,894
hey, I'm just wrong for the part.

868
00:57:14,953 --> 00:57:16,035
So you're not a hero.

869
00:57:16,061 --> 00:57:19,875
Just Monday through Friday,
4:30 to 5 Eastern Time.

870
00:57:20,651 --> 00:57:21,751
So that's it,

871
00:57:21,836 --> 00:57:24,733
you're just gonna abandon
my sister and my best friend,

872
00:57:24,794 --> 00:57:27,106
just leave 'em out there to die?

873
00:57:27,238 --> 00:57:28,630
You're right.

874
00:57:28,778 --> 00:57:31,041
You're not the Defender of the Universe,

875
00:57:31,087 --> 00:57:32,679
not the Promised One,

876
00:57:32,806 --> 00:57:34,275
you're nothing.

877
00:57:47,769 --> 00:57:49,268
You know Bailey,

878
00:57:50,401 --> 00:57:53,131
nobody talks to Ty Farrell like that.

879
00:57:53,624 --> 00:57:55,061
I am a big star,

880
00:57:55,430 --> 00:57:57,594
and I have my own TV show,

881
00:57:57,924 --> 00:58:00,427
and everybody's always
telling me how great I am.

882
00:58:00,449 --> 00:58:03,042
Oh, terrific work Ty, fabulous Ty,

883
00:58:03,105 --> 00:58:05,601
I don't know how you do it Ty.

884
00:58:06,101 --> 00:58:07,453
And you know what,

885
00:58:07,822 --> 00:58:10,172
after a while you start to believe it...

886
00:58:10,946 --> 00:58:13,181
but deep down you know the truth,

887
00:58:15,149 --> 00:58:16,622
and you're right kid,

888
00:58:17,474 --> 00:58:19,255
I am nothing,

889
00:58:19,838 --> 00:58:22,662
and I have some work to do
on my character.

890
00:58:24,909 --> 00:58:27,021
Let's go save your sister, kid.

891
00:58:33,149 --> 00:58:34,437
Perfect.

892
00:58:34,562 --> 00:58:37,165
Stuck in the wilderness with
the wrong pair of shoes.

893
00:58:37,196 --> 00:58:39,798
My sensors indicate this is where
our comrades were attacked.

894
00:58:39,826 --> 00:58:42,615
Good, then we should learn
from their mistakes and leave.

895
00:58:42,651 --> 00:58:45,890
Now, on Illumina's recording it sounded
like they were being dragged away.

896
00:58:45,939 --> 00:58:48,877
Then why aren't I picking up any
tissue traces along the ground.

897
00:58:48,907 --> 00:58:51,524
Perhaps they weren't
dragged along the ground.

898
00:58:51,550 --> 00:58:55,090
- What do you mean?
- Oh, don't fall for her act. She doesn't know.

899
00:58:55,124 --> 00:58:59,439
In religion school, they teach us to answer a
question with a question. It makes us sound wise.

900
00:58:59,455 --> 00:59:00,637
Wait a minute,

901
00:59:00,776 --> 00:59:02,808
I think Sagan is on to something.

902
00:59:02,983 --> 00:59:05,054
I'm picking up a maze
of tunnels underneath us.

903
00:59:05,418 --> 00:59:08,610
If they were dragged underground,
we wouldn't pick up any traces.

904
00:59:08,629 --> 00:59:10,388
Is there an entrance?

905
00:59:10,663 --> 00:59:12,202
100 meters in that direction.

906
00:59:12,224 --> 00:59:14,069
Good work, Sagan.

907
00:59:14,450 --> 00:59:16,906
She didn't do anything.

908
00:59:20,048 --> 00:59:22,176
I've never heard of an underground race.

909
00:59:22,197 --> 00:59:24,862
There's nothing written about
one in Pangean scripture.

910
00:59:24,889 --> 00:59:26,569
Guess we don't know
everything then, do we?

911
00:59:26,571 --> 00:59:29,357
I just wish they get to the light so
we can see what we're up against.

912
00:59:29,359 --> 00:59:32,317
Sometimes it's better not to know.
Keeps you from thinking twice.

913
00:59:32,333 --> 00:59:34,357
I say we move in and hope for the best.

914
00:59:34,384 --> 00:59:35,790
Oh yeah, what are we waiting for.

915
00:59:35,805 --> 00:59:39,530
We've got an old woman, a bratty kid,
a screwed up robot, an ego-mad womanizer.

916
00:59:39,532 --> 00:59:41,126
These guys don't stand a chance.

917
00:59:41,141 --> 00:59:44,654
Look, nobody asked you to come along and
don't you ever call my Bailey a brat.

918
00:59:44,669 --> 00:59:46,893
And I'm supposed to listen
to a trash can that talks.

919
00:59:46,895 --> 00:59:49,611
Perhaps if you would listen,
you'd learn something.

920
00:59:49,642 --> 00:59:51,057
You tell his circuits.

921
00:59:51,175 --> 00:59:52,308
Enough!

922
00:59:52,563 --> 00:59:55,058
We've got to find Tyra and Stimulus.

923
01:00:03,916 --> 01:00:05,146
Who are you people?

924
01:00:05,256 --> 01:00:06,912
What do you want from us?

925
01:00:07,327 --> 01:00:09,017
I asked you a question!

926
01:00:09,103 --> 01:00:10,931
Who are you?!

927
01:00:26,484 --> 01:00:28,439
Don't you want something to eat?

928
01:00:28,620 --> 01:00:31,195
Not if it's what they had.

929
01:00:36,472 --> 01:00:39,021
Here... eat.

930
01:00:43,365 --> 01:00:44,865
Leave it alone.

931
01:00:45,029 --> 01:00:48,685
No one should ever see what
Vox's torturers did to me.

932
01:01:01,302 --> 01:01:02,490
Oh...

933
01:01:02,623 --> 01:01:04,670
it's, it's...

934
01:01:04,772 --> 01:01:06,677
Ugly even to someone who can't see.

935
01:01:06,702 --> 01:01:07,970
No.

936
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:11,781
You're so big and powerful but,

937
01:01:11,804 --> 01:01:14,592
I feel such, kindness.

938
01:01:16,457 --> 01:01:17,652
Love.

939
01:01:27,514 --> 01:01:30,204
My guess is that Tyra and Stimulus
are locked up in those cells.

940
01:01:30,225 --> 01:01:31,867
We're gonna have to bust them out.

941
01:01:31,884 --> 01:01:33,990
What is your plan?

942
01:01:34,882 --> 01:01:38,196
We'll light a small fire, we'll generate
as much smoke as possible,

943
01:01:38,216 --> 01:01:40,363
and in the confusion,
we'll rescue Tyra and Stimulus.

944
01:01:40,371 --> 01:01:42,539
We'll be gone before the smoke clears.

945
01:01:42,759 --> 01:01:44,219
Think it'll work?

946
01:01:44,314 --> 01:01:45,919
Sure, we did it every season.

947
01:01:45,979 --> 01:01:49,479
That's the only decent diversion
the writers came up with.

948
01:01:49,961 --> 01:01:50,891
See!

949
01:01:51,284 --> 01:01:52,065
Choking!

950
01:01:52,082 --> 01:01:53,458
It would have worked.

951
01:01:53,526 --> 01:01:56,285
I mean, who knew they
didn't need eyes to see?

952
01:01:56,347 --> 01:01:59,967
Careful, buddy. This costume was
designed by two-time Oscar winner...

953
01:01:59,983 --> 01:02:02,316
Zoom, Zoom, Zoom, Zoom...

954
01:02:29,321 --> 01:02:31,034
Greetings, Captain.

955
01:02:32,439 --> 01:02:33,611
Oh, Stimulus.

956
01:02:33,626 --> 01:02:36,744
Am I glad to see you. I thought I was
gonna have to fight one of these people.

957
01:02:36,768 --> 01:02:38,548
Prepare to die, Captain.

958
01:02:48,062 --> 01:02:49,370
Stimulus...

959
01:02:49,660 --> 01:02:51,823
I'm not horsing around.
Somebody could get hurt.

960
01:02:51,838 --> 01:02:53,819
You catch on quickly.

961
01:02:56,767 --> 01:02:58,270
Oh great.

962
01:03:01,401 --> 01:03:03,293
You're excellent with the sword, Captain.

963
01:03:03,301 --> 01:03:05,717
Some of the best deals in Hollywood,

964
01:03:05,850 --> 01:03:07,651
are made on a tennis court.

965
01:03:13,243 --> 01:03:14,661
Had enough?

966
01:03:16,066 --> 01:03:17,891
Stimulus, what's gotten into you?

967
01:03:17,911 --> 01:03:19,983
If I kill you,
they'll let me live among them.

968
01:03:20,003 --> 01:03:23,517
Oh, this is wonderful, and they
seem like such a nice people.

969
01:03:26,894 --> 01:03:28,163
You don't understand.

970
01:03:28,179 --> 01:03:30,762
In this land of the sightless,
I'm not hideous.

971
01:03:30,764 --> 01:03:32,121
But I don't think you're hideous.

972
01:03:32,123 --> 01:03:34,075
That's because I've
never shown you my face.

973
01:03:34,087 --> 01:03:35,962
All those who've seen it are repulsed.

974
01:03:35,965 --> 01:03:38,618
But you're judging me
without giving me a chance.

975
01:03:38,627 --> 01:03:40,420
I won't be repulsed.

976
01:04:01,474 --> 01:04:03,954
Jeez, Louise.

977
01:04:05,849 --> 01:04:09,405
All right so I was wrong alright.
Looks aren't everything.

978
01:04:09,603 --> 01:04:12,033
It's how you feel about yo...

979
01:04:18,077 --> 01:04:19,374
Simulus!

980
01:04:19,748 --> 01:04:22,593
Go ahead, Stimulus. Finish me off
if that's what you have to do.

981
01:04:22,615 --> 01:04:25,934
Huh, hey, maybe they'll let you kill the
others, too. The people who accepted you,

982
01:04:25,946 --> 01:04:29,943
who never asked you to murder anybody
just to prove your loyalty.

983
01:04:48,383 --> 01:04:49,716
I'm sorry, Captain.

984
01:04:50,130 --> 01:04:51,621
It's okay, Stimulus.

985
01:04:52,951 --> 01:04:54,591
Forget it folks,

986
01:04:54,753 --> 01:04:57,128
we're through putting on
a show for you people.

987
01:04:57,188 --> 01:05:01,017
You want to see Captain
Zoom fight, buy a TV set.

988
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:06,450
Zoom?

989
01:05:06,551 --> 01:05:11,139
Zoom, Zoom, Zoom,
Zoom, Zoom, Zoom,

990
01:05:11,288 --> 01:05:16,163
Zoom, Zoom, Zoom,
Zoom, Zoom, Zoom,

991
01:05:16,211 --> 01:05:17,571
Zoom, Zoom...

992
01:05:17,591 --> 01:05:20,346
Sorry guys, I don't have any
eight by tens to autograph.

993
01:05:20,370 --> 01:05:21,979
Zoom!

994
01:05:23,133 --> 01:05:24,554
Oh Promised One,

995
01:05:24,633 --> 01:05:28,034
Great Rhea instructed us to
prepare for your arrival.

996
01:05:28,159 --> 01:05:30,331
We have waited
uncounted lifetimes.

997
01:05:30,389 --> 01:05:31,624
Captain.

998
01:05:31,824 --> 01:05:34,480
These must be the gatekeepers.

999
01:05:34,572 --> 01:05:36,533
Uh, is, is that true?

1000
01:05:37,511 --> 01:05:43,095
Can you, tell us, uh,
uh, the directions...

1001
01:05:43,182 --> 01:05:47,405
to the temple... of Rhea?

1002
01:05:48,112 --> 01:05:50,661
Is there another Captain Zoom?

1003
01:06:17,973 --> 01:06:19,700
We can lead you no further.

1004
01:06:19,802 --> 01:06:22,010
None of us has ever been
beyond this point.

1005
01:06:22,044 --> 01:06:22,997
It is written,

1006
01:06:23,075 --> 01:06:25,482
only the Promised One,
will return from the voyage.

1007
01:06:25,518 --> 01:06:27,994
The Promised One and
his friends right?

1008
01:06:28,043 --> 01:06:32,469
Thank you, Oh Promised One, for
allowing us to fulfill, our destiny.

1009
01:06:32,540 --> 01:06:35,290
Zoom, Zoom,
Zoom, Zoom...

1010
01:06:35,554 --> 01:06:41,135
I thought it was a big deal when I was Grand
Marshal of the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade.

1011
01:06:42,077 --> 01:06:45,268
You know, this boat doesn't
really look big enough.

1012
01:06:45,315 --> 01:06:46,792
I'll stay here.

1013
01:06:46,851 --> 01:06:49,321
You are welcome here, sister.

1014
01:06:50,786 --> 01:06:53,387
On second thought, let the kid
and his girlfriend stay.

1015
01:06:53,406 --> 01:06:54,232
Hey.

1016
01:06:54,258 --> 01:06:55,845
No Bailey, she's right.

1017
01:06:55,935 --> 01:06:57,407
It's too dangerous.

1018
01:06:58,218 --> 01:07:00,288
I will come back for you.

1019
01:07:04,544 --> 01:07:05,581
I know you will.

1020
01:07:05,605 --> 01:07:07,666
You know, if it's really
gonna be that dangerous...

1021
01:07:07,708 --> 01:07:08,703
Sit.

1022
01:07:14,288 --> 01:07:16,476
Zoom, Zoom, Zoom, Zoom...

1023
01:07:16,546 --> 01:07:17,729
So long folks.

1024
01:07:18,178 --> 01:07:20,264
Zoom, Zoom, Zoom, Zoom,

1025
01:07:20,388 --> 01:07:22,497
Zoom, Zoom, Zoom, Zoom,

1026
01:07:22,612 --> 01:07:24,651
Zoom, Zoom, Zoom, Zoom...

1027
01:07:48,723 --> 01:07:50,161
Look.

1028
01:07:51,065 --> 01:07:53,405
I never thought I'd live to see it...

1029
01:07:53,681 --> 01:07:56,143
the coming of the Promised One...

1030
01:07:56,716 --> 01:08:00,208
memorized by the first
high priestess of Pangea,

1031
01:08:00,333 --> 01:08:03,812
and handed down to each
of her successors.

1032
01:08:03,976 --> 01:08:07,894
So this is where it is
written... is written.

1033
01:08:17,038 --> 01:08:18,602
I don't believe it...

1034
01:08:19,303 --> 01:08:21,037
you really are the Promised One.

1035
01:08:21,184 --> 01:08:23,908
I knew it. I prophesied it first.

1036
01:08:24,243 --> 01:08:25,475
How could this be?

1037
01:08:25,913 --> 01:08:27,399
I just can't...

1038
01:08:27,548 --> 01:08:28,642
That's me.

1039
01:08:29,178 --> 01:08:31,174
They didn't get the chin quite right,

1040
01:08:31,220 --> 01:08:33,190
but that's me. How could this happen?

1041
01:08:33,238 --> 01:08:37,141
The passage of time, was an obsolete
concept to the ancients.

1042
01:08:37,302 --> 01:08:40,696
They were the masters of
the past and of the future.

1043
01:08:40,865 --> 01:08:44,073
But, come on, of all the
people in the universe...

1044
01:08:44,190 --> 01:08:45,706
they choose me?

1045
01:08:46,828 --> 01:08:50,136
And my old man said
I'd never amount to anything.

1046
01:08:50,588 --> 01:08:52,002
Which way?

1047
01:08:53,574 --> 01:08:54,946
Let's go to the left.

1048
01:08:55,135 --> 01:08:57,653
That's the direction our
scripture's always written from.

1049
01:08:57,677 --> 01:09:01,279
Which direction does the
Promised One want to go in?

1050
01:09:12,655 --> 01:09:14,132
The Promised One...

1051
01:09:15,375 --> 01:09:16,789
says that way.

1052
01:09:18,427 --> 01:09:20,796
We'll ride it out the Promised One.

1053
01:09:34,048 --> 01:09:35,786
Look, the tunnel is ending.

1054
01:09:35,910 --> 01:09:37,645
You made the right choice, Captain.

1055
01:09:37,702 --> 01:09:40,926
Of course I made the right choice,
I am the Promised One.

1056
01:10:02,883 --> 01:10:04,757
Excellent choice, Captain.

1057
01:10:05,324 --> 01:10:08,437
The Promised One,
does not appreciate sarcasm.

1058
01:10:08,562 --> 01:10:11,389
Come, we must find the temple of Rhea.

1059
01:10:11,430 --> 01:10:15,891
Right. We have a prophecy to fulfill.

1060
01:10:16,034 --> 01:10:17,151
Huh...

1061
01:10:18,822 --> 01:10:21,882
I say we go... that way.

1062
01:10:22,445 --> 01:10:24,508
Uh, Captain.

1063
01:10:24,610 --> 01:10:27,717
Perhaps we should just,
go up these stairs.

1064
01:10:28,561 --> 01:10:30,617
The Promised One concurs.

1065
01:10:31,016 --> 01:10:33,272
Would you stop calling yourself that.

1066
01:10:33,382 --> 01:10:35,115
What, it's written.

1067
01:10:42,959 --> 01:10:44,100
Carefull.

1068
01:11:01,006 --> 01:11:05,088
Behold, the house of the great God Rhea.

1069
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:07,573
Could use a little landscaping.

1070
01:11:07,696 --> 01:11:08,912
Hey, wait.

1071
01:11:09,545 --> 01:11:11,468
I've seen these doors before.

1072
01:11:12,035 --> 01:11:12,910
In your dream?

1073
01:11:12,942 --> 01:11:14,584
No, no, in my TV show.

1074
01:11:14,608 --> 01:11:19,231
It looks like the set of the episode I
was doing when Bailey brought me here.

1075
01:11:25,248 --> 01:11:26,389
What the?

1076
01:11:27,149 --> 01:11:28,245
What's happening?

1077
01:11:38,702 --> 01:11:40,044
It is written,

1078
01:11:40,463 --> 01:11:45,272
that the Promised One will know
the prayer, to open the door.

1079
01:11:45,296 --> 01:11:46,600
What prayer?

1080
01:11:47,868 --> 01:11:52,694
Oh, come on, I can't remember dialog,
that's why I use que cards!

1081
01:11:53,043 --> 01:11:54,785
My hair, my hair!

1082
01:11:54,877 --> 01:11:56,088
Hurry!

1083
01:11:56,211 --> 01:11:57,975
Hurry, Captain, time to pray.

1084
01:12:00,264 --> 01:12:01,538
I mean I...

1085
01:12:01,583 --> 01:12:03,590
Hurry, Captain Zoom, hurry...

1086
01:12:05,749 --> 01:12:07,374
OFFOB...

1087
01:12:07,773 --> 01:12:09,062
SI...

1088
01:12:09,427 --> 01:12:10,763
OKCOS...

1089
01:12:11,505 --> 01:12:12,924
OKCOHC!

1090
01:12:23,331 --> 01:12:25,118
You remembered the words.

1091
01:12:25,305 --> 01:12:26,835
I didn't need cue cards.

1092
01:12:26,836 --> 01:12:31,633
All I had to do was remember how to
say Chocko Socko is boffo backwards.

1093
01:12:32,336 --> 01:12:34,261
Chocko Socko?

1094
01:12:54,922 --> 01:12:56,623
The great Rhea.

1095
01:13:02,225 --> 01:13:05,968
From him we will attain the
power to free our people.

1096
01:13:06,462 --> 01:13:07,664
Or...

1097
01:13:07,895 --> 01:13:09,523
Let's go!

1098
01:13:12,269 --> 01:13:15,368
...the power to enslave your people,

1099
01:13:15,653 --> 01:13:17,537
depending on how you look at it.

1100
01:13:17,588 --> 01:13:19,389
Excuse me, excuse me.

1101
01:13:20,432 --> 01:13:23,013
How, did you find us?

1102
01:13:23,208 --> 01:13:26,736
I owe it all to my unceremoniously
defrocked high priestess.

1103
01:13:26,781 --> 01:13:28,191
I knew you were a traitor.

1104
01:13:28,231 --> 01:13:29,993
We should have left you
floating in space.

1105
01:13:30,008 --> 01:13:32,182
I didn't lead him here, I swear.

1106
01:13:32,227 --> 01:13:34,566
Of course you did, my darling.

1107
01:13:34,905 --> 01:13:38,087
Your, Vectron amulet...

1108
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:40,868
is a tracking device.

1109
01:13:43,832 --> 01:13:45,471
You've got to believe me, I didn't know.

1110
01:13:45,509 --> 01:13:48,838
Don't worry about it Vesper,
they won't shun you for long.

1111
01:13:49,049 --> 01:13:50,949
You'll all be dead in a moment.

1112
01:13:51,333 --> 01:13:55,878
Doesn't Lord Vox prefer to torture and
mutilate his victims, before killing 'em.

1113
01:13:58,736 --> 01:14:00,887
You seem familiar but
I can't place the face.

1114
01:14:01,101 --> 01:14:03,366
Perhaps you'd remember me
if I was screaming in agony

1115
01:14:03,378 --> 01:14:07,018
as your torturer seared the skin off
my face with a white hot scalpel.

1116
01:14:07,499 --> 01:14:10,227
Sorry, that doesn't really
help narrow it down.

1117
01:14:10,440 --> 01:14:12,173
Now, let's see.

1118
01:14:13,820 --> 01:14:18,340
Who has, pissed me off, the most.

1119
01:14:25,938 --> 01:14:28,208
That would be you, my love.

1120
01:14:29,404 --> 01:14:30,558
However...

1121
01:14:31,991 --> 01:14:35,079
I'll give you one last chance
to share my throne.

1122
01:14:35,271 --> 01:14:37,530
I would rather die a thousand deaths.

1123
01:14:38,196 --> 01:14:39,333
Well...

1124
01:14:40,389 --> 01:14:42,133
let me help you get started.

1125
01:14:42,173 --> 01:14:44,009
Run Tyra!

1126
01:15:07,534 --> 01:15:08,846
Oh, God!

1127
01:15:08,876 --> 01:15:09,871
God!

1128
01:15:20,290 --> 01:15:21,286
Ah!

1129
01:15:29,351 --> 01:15:32,028
Wait 30 seconds.

1130
01:15:32,102 --> 01:15:32,749
Kill 'em!

1131
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:34,021
Get up!

1132
01:15:36,976 --> 01:15:38,279
Vesper.

1133
01:15:39,811 --> 01:15:40,807
High Priestess.

1134
01:15:45,054 --> 01:15:49,054
At least, I didn't die a virgin.

1135
01:16:15,020 --> 01:16:16,346
Where was this written?

1136
01:16:16,582 --> 01:16:18,538
Temper, temper, Captain.

1137
01:16:18,579 --> 01:16:20,573
I've spared your life this long.

1138
01:16:21,052 --> 01:16:23,103
Don't make me kill you
before we finished.

1139
01:16:23,122 --> 01:16:25,600
What do you mean,
spared my life this long?

1140
01:16:25,811 --> 01:16:29,125
For years I've studied the
ancient legends of Pangea.

1141
01:16:29,278 --> 01:16:32,053
I could have laid waste
to the planet years ago,

1142
01:16:32,111 --> 01:16:36,141
but how could I risk destroying
some vital clue to its secrets.

1143
01:16:36,368 --> 01:16:39,170
Then came Captain Zoom.

1144
01:16:40,191 --> 01:16:42,028
Dear Captain Zoom,

1145
01:16:42,316 --> 01:16:46,052
when you stole my Vesper's purity, I knew
then that you were fulfilling prophecy.

1146
01:16:46,076 --> 01:16:50,050
I simply, sat back and let you
lead me to the grand prize.

1147
01:16:51,825 --> 01:16:53,378
The power of Rhea.

1148
01:16:55,026 --> 01:16:56,300
And now...

1149
01:16:57,373 --> 01:17:00,898
I shall give you all the opportunity
to witness my coronation.

1150
01:17:01,140 --> 01:17:02,062
Coronation?

1151
01:17:02,113 --> 01:17:03,974
Oh, dear Tyra...

1152
01:17:04,489 --> 01:17:07,031
with the power of Rhea
I can subjugate the weak,

1153
01:17:07,070 --> 01:17:10,744
and destroy all those who will
not bow down before me.

1154
01:17:13,854 --> 01:17:18,494
I will use their blood, to paint a
pathway of fear across the universe.

1155
01:17:18,794 --> 01:17:22,084
You're looking at the next, the first...

1156
01:17:22,683 --> 01:17:25,374
Emperor, of Everything!

1157
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:42,570
Can't decide, huh?

1158
01:17:43,461 --> 01:17:47,610
Guess somebody didn't study his
ancient legends hard enough.

1159
01:17:47,869 --> 01:17:50,697
Is it the sword, or the scroll?

1160
01:17:51,046 --> 01:17:53,153
Which one will help you
subjugate the weak,

1161
01:17:53,208 --> 01:17:56,050
or kill all those fools who don't
bow down before you.

1162
01:17:56,144 --> 01:17:58,206
Is it the sword Vox...

1163
01:17:58,542 --> 01:17:59,956
or is it the scroll?

1164
01:18:00,047 --> 01:18:02,323
Hurry, Rhea doesn't have all day.

1165
01:18:02,600 --> 01:18:03,668
Now, if it was me...

1166
01:18:03,670 --> 01:18:05,342
Will you shut up?!

1167
01:18:05,441 --> 01:18:08,010
Fine, just trying to help.

1168
01:18:09,326 --> 01:18:10,860
It's the sword.

1169
01:18:17,618 --> 01:18:19,496
You're trying to trick me.

1170
01:18:20,005 --> 01:18:22,515
You said that so I won't
take the sword.

1171
01:18:37,945 --> 01:18:39,891
The power of Rhea...

1172
01:18:40,706 --> 01:18:42,897
and it is mine!

1173
01:18:55,575 --> 01:18:56,903
Look!

1174
01:18:57,457 --> 01:18:58,801
It's alive.

1175
01:19:08,285 --> 01:19:09,718
Come back, you fools.

1176
01:19:09,971 --> 01:19:13,755
Great Rhea,
is going to pay me his respects.

1177
01:19:15,566 --> 01:19:17,557
What an unexpected pleasure.

1178
01:19:17,619 --> 01:19:20,248
I've heard so much about you.

1179
01:19:58,813 --> 01:20:00,900
I think I'm gonna be sick.

1180
01:20:33,193 --> 01:20:36,586
This contains,
the secrets of the ancients.

1181
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:41,318
With it we can lead Pangea
into a new golden age.

1182
01:20:41,530 --> 01:20:44,507
How did you know to trick Vox
into taking the sword?

1183
01:20:44,644 --> 01:20:47,033
The pen is mightier than the sword.

1184
01:20:47,256 --> 01:20:48,717
Another first season show.

1185
01:20:48,795 --> 01:20:52,015
We got a Peabody Award for
getting kids to read more.

1186
01:21:04,805 --> 01:21:07,258
Hey, why you dancing with her?

1187
01:21:18,986 --> 01:21:20,083
You see that?

1188
01:21:20,724 --> 01:21:22,381
That's where I was born,

1189
01:21:22,591 --> 01:21:24,644
that's where I went to school,

1190
01:21:25,416 --> 01:21:27,973
that's where I used to look at the stars.

1191
01:21:32,765 --> 01:21:33,854
Captain...

1192
01:21:34,768 --> 01:21:36,965
You don't have to say anything, Tyra.

1193
01:21:37,152 --> 01:21:40,166
I know you lied about there being
a way for me to get home.

1194
01:21:40,284 --> 01:21:41,302
I didn't have a choice.

1195
01:21:41,314 --> 01:21:42,559
Yes you did.

1196
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:46,032
But you made the right one.

1197
01:21:48,414 --> 01:21:49,922
Captain, I swear to you,

1198
01:21:49,946 --> 01:21:53,724
somehow, someday,
I will find a way to get you home.

1199
01:21:54,846 --> 01:21:57,040
You know, you'd like New York.

1200
01:21:57,151 --> 01:21:59,258
Oh, first a Broadway show,

1201
01:21:59,290 --> 01:22:01,983
no, then a hansom cab ride
through Central Park,

1202
01:22:01,998 --> 01:22:04,348
and then we'd sweep into 21,

1203
01:22:04,465 --> 01:22:06,289
and all the heads would turn...

1204
01:22:06,342 --> 01:22:09,482
Because they'd all be looking at you.

1205
01:22:10,328 --> 01:22:11,297
No.

1206
01:22:12,984 --> 01:22:17,465
Because no one on Earth has ever,
seen a woman as beautiful as you.

1207
01:22:21,986 --> 01:22:23,287
Thank you.

1208
01:22:23,386 --> 01:22:26,371
It's nothing, thank me later...

1209
01:22:26,987 --> 01:22:28,681
when we're alone in your tent...

1210
01:22:29,414 --> 01:22:32,248
and you'll have one more reason
to call me the Promised One.

1211
01:22:32,291 --> 01:22:33,765
Enough.

1212
01:22:38,512 --> 01:22:40,723
They want you to make a speech.

1213
01:22:41,848 --> 01:22:43,442
You're their hero.

1214
01:22:45,938 --> 01:22:47,133
And mine.

1215
01:23:16,713 --> 01:23:18,506
Ah, well.

1216
01:23:19,700 --> 01:23:22,747
I, just want to say to you guys,
that, uh...

1217
01:23:23,244 --> 01:23:24,937
well you've been great.

1218
01:23:25,076 --> 01:23:27,156
I'm a little new here and you've...

1219
01:23:27,429 --> 01:23:29,774
really made me feel at home.

1220
01:23:30,024 --> 01:23:31,814
And, uh...

1221
01:23:33,520 --> 01:23:34,989
well if there's...

1222
01:23:36,137 --> 01:23:38,052
one thing I've learned...

1223
01:23:39,334 --> 01:23:41,704
it's that Captain Zoom's destiny,

1224
01:23:41,922 --> 01:23:44,172
as Defender of the Universe,

1225
01:23:44,513 --> 01:23:46,759
was written in the stars.

1226
01:23:56,939 --> 01:23:58,450
We can never rest...

1227
01:23:59,934 --> 01:24:03,143
in our continuing war against
injustice and oppression.

1228
01:24:05,038 --> 01:24:07,007
Together we can be...

1229
01:24:08,632 --> 01:24:10,186
we must be...

1230
01:24:11,092 --> 01:24:12,905
we will be...

1231

01:24:24,352 --> 01:24:25,642
Zoom, Zoom, Zoom,

1235
01:24:25,713 --> 01:24:27,112
Zoom, Zoom, Zoom...
