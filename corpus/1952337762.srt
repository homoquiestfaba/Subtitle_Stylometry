1
00:01:42,435 --> 00:01:44,596
-Come on. Come on, darling.

2
00:01:44,704 --> 00:01:47,332
Come on. Come, come, come,
come, come. Come on.

3
00:01:47,440 --> 00:01:48,998
Ahh.

4
00:01:50,643 --> 00:01:53,111
Ah, lovely.
Come on. Come on.

5
00:01:53,213 --> 00:01:56,182
- Bit further.. Come on. Come on.

6
00:02:31,017 --> 00:02:34,953
This is the story of my childhood.

7
00:02:35,054 --> 00:02:39,286
In August 1924, I was born
Janet Paterson Frame.

8
00:02:39,392 --> 00:02:41,292
My twin, who was never named...

9
00:02:41,394 --> 00:02:43,521
died two weeks later..

10
00:03:31,010 --> 00:03:32,910
"Sea... cliff.. "

11
00:03:33,012 --> 00:03:36,038
That's where all the loonies go.

12
00:03:36,149 --> 00:03:39,778
Go away from the window.
Go back to your seats, Myrtle and Bruddie.

13
00:03:39,886 --> 00:03:41,547
Go on.

14
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:59,259
- Come on.
- Margaret.

15
00:04:59,365 --> 00:05:01,265
Come on,Jean.

16
00:05:01,367 --> 00:05:04,268
- Peter.

17
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:06,600
- I'll be your friend.
- Please? Please?

18
00:05:06,706 --> 00:05:08,697
Betty.

19
00:05:08,808 --> 00:05:11,208
- Come on,Jean.
- Peter.

20
00:05:11,311 --> 00:05:14,474
- Come on,Jean.
- Olive.

21
00:05:39,138 --> 00:05:41,470
Billy Delaware.

22
00:05:41,574 --> 00:05:43,735
Yes, Miss Botting?

23
00:05:44,777 --> 00:05:46,176
What are you eating?

24
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,346
Chewing gum, Miss Botting.

25
00:05:53,519 --> 00:05:55,077
Where did you get it?

26
00:06:00,893 --> 00:06:02,861
Dids McIvor

27
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:07,528
Where did you get your chewing gum?

28
00:06:07,633 --> 00:06:10,397
From Jean Frame, Miss Botting.

29
00:06:10,503 --> 00:06:13,267
Jean Frame.

30
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:15,341
Yes, Miss Botting?

31
00:06:15,441 --> 00:06:17,568
Where did you get the chewing gum?

32
00:06:17,677 --> 00:06:20,168
From Heath's, Miss Botting.

33
00:06:37,764 --> 00:06:40,460
Where did you get the money?

34
00:06:40,566 --> 00:06:42,261
Out!

35
00:06:43,436 --> 00:06:45,461
My father gave it to me.

36
00:06:45,571 --> 00:06:47,869
Where did you get the money?

37
00:06:47,974 --> 00:06:51,432
- Collect!
- My father - My father gave it to me.

38
00:06:52,712 --> 00:06:54,680
Come out here.

39
00:07:01,888 --> 00:07:03,856
Come up here.

40
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,260
Now tell me...

41
00:07:09,362 --> 00:07:11,990
where you got the money.

42
00:07:12,098 --> 00:07:14,965
I want... the truth.

43
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,558
Dad gave it to me.

44
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,638
Face the blackboard.

45
00:07:25,845 --> 00:07:27,244
Now...

46
00:07:28,681 --> 00:07:31,343
you will stay there...

47
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,351
until you tell me...

48
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:35,580
the truth.

49
00:08:10,857 --> 00:08:13,485
Turn around, Jean Frame.

50
00:08:16,028 --> 00:08:18,997
Are you ready to tell me the truth?

51
00:08:22,368 --> 00:08:24,996
I stole it out of Dad's pocket.

52
00:08:27,306 --> 00:08:29,934
Go to the back of the class.

53
00:08:37,617 --> 00:08:39,585
She's a thief!

54
00:08:40,620 --> 00:08:43,953
Thief. She's a thief.

55
00:08:46,058 --> 00:08:48,026
You're a thief.

56
00:08:55,268 --> 00:08:56,735
Turn.

57
00:09:00,006 --> 00:09:01,473
Turn.

58
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:06,078
No, June, you have to turn
the same way as us.

59
00:09:09,682 --> 00:09:11,149
Turn.

60
00:09:13,419 --> 00:09:14,886
And turn.

61
00:09:17,223 --> 00:09:18,952
And turn.

62
00:09:20,793 --> 00:09:22,260
And turn.

63
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:31,866
He's having a convulsion!
He's having a convulsion, Curly!

64
00:09:31,971 --> 00:09:34,940
- Curly!

65
00:09:36,809 --> 00:09:38,709
Go and have a look!

66
00:09:42,515 --> 00:09:45,416
- What are you doing, woman?
- Putting him in the bath!

67
00:09:45,518 --> 00:09:47,418
- What?
- In the bath!

68
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,115
What the hell for?

69
00:09:51,223 --> 00:09:53,623
Curly? Curly?

70
00:09:53,726 --> 00:09:55,626
- Put him in the bath!
- What?

71
00:09:55,728 --> 00:09:58,492
- Put him in the bath!
- I'm not putting him in the bath.

72
00:09:58,598 --> 00:10:01,158
The boy's just having a bad dream.

73
00:10:01,267 --> 00:10:03,167
- Here's a towel.
- Oh, come on, woman! Why?

74
00:10:03,269 --> 00:10:05,032
The book says so!

75
00:10:05,137 --> 00:10:06,934
Wake up, boy!

76
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,837
- Wake up!

77
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,206
You girls, back to bed!

78
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,279
Wake up!

79
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,281
That's it.

80
00:10:17,383 --> 00:10:19,351
Wake up Wake up!

81
00:11:06,766 --> 00:11:11,135
Georgie Porgie's queer in the head!
Georgie Porgie's queer in the head!

82
00:11:13,239 --> 00:11:15,469
Doesn't belong at this school anyway.

83
00:11:15,574 --> 00:11:19,010
- You belong in the loonybin.
-Loonybin! Loonybin!

84
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:43,932
Back!
Class, quiet, please!

85
00:11:44,036 --> 00:11:48,063
I want those children
whose names Doctor calls -

86
00:11:48,174 --> 00:11:50,438
Tom McKechnie, are you listening?

87
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,238
Yes, miss.

88
00:11:52,344 --> 00:11:54,835
When you hear your names called...

89
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:57,848
I want you to fall out.

90
00:11:57,950 --> 00:11:59,918
Ivor Thomas.

91
00:12:02,822 --> 00:12:05,586
-Jimmy McGill.
- That's the one with the ears.

92
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:07,892
Jean Frame.

93
00:12:12,565 --> 00:12:14,192
Nora Byrne.

94
00:12:15,835 --> 00:12:17,803
Terrible family.

95
00:12:19,138 --> 00:12:23,097
Now, the rest of you
may go in quietly.

96
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:30,714
In your Lines! Quietly!

97
00:12:30,816 --> 00:12:32,784
Come on, folks, follow me.

98
00:12:35,955 --> 00:12:37,923
Follow me.

99
00:12:48,968 --> 00:12:50,868
Look.

100
00:12:50,970 --> 00:12:52,870
When did you last wash?

101
00:12:52,972 --> 00:12:55,099
- Yesterday.
- Really?

102
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:59,109
- I did wash yesterday.
- And what did you wash?

103
00:12:59,211 --> 00:13:01,179
My hands.

104
00:13:02,548 --> 00:13:05,517
- Your ears are filthy.

105
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:10,917
Say after me whatever you hear
down the tube in a big, loud voice.

106
00:13:12,191 --> 00:13:15,251
Twenty-nine. Seventeen.

107
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:17,829
Sixteen. Five.

108
00:13:25,004 --> 00:13:27,097
I know how to cure warts.

109
00:13:35,915 --> 00:13:38,509
- My real name isn't Poppy.
- What is it?

110
00:13:38,617 --> 00:13:40,517
Marjorie.

111
00:13:40,619 --> 00:13:44,555
- Is your name your real name?
- My real name's Janet.

112
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,285
Janet. That's pretty.

113
00:13:47,393 --> 00:13:50,123
But I get called Jean mostly.

114
00:13:50,229 --> 00:13:52,720
And Nini. And Topsy.

115
00:13:52,832 --> 00:13:54,959
Is that because of your hair?

116
00:13:55,067 --> 00:13:57,126
Yes.

117
00:13:57,236 --> 00:14:00,205
- Can I touch it?
- Yes.

118
00:14:02,474 --> 00:14:05,136
You can touch my legs if you like.

119
00:14:05,244 --> 00:14:07,678
What are they?

120
00:14:07,780 --> 00:14:11,841
They're from when my dad whops me
with his machine belt.

121
00:14:13,485 --> 00:14:15,612
They feel funny, don't they?

122
00:14:17,489 --> 00:14:21,823
Tell the class
we will now have a nail inspection.

123
00:14:21,927 --> 00:14:26,023
Class, we are now going to have
a nail inspection.

124
00:14:26,131 --> 00:14:28,099
Hands on desks.

125
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,668
- Very good.
- Very good.

126
00:14:35,774 --> 00:14:37,674
Excellent.

127
00:14:37,776 --> 00:14:40,370
- Bad.
- Disgusting.

128
00:14:40,479 --> 00:14:43,710
Miss Frame, collect up
the naughty children.

129
00:14:43,816 --> 00:14:46,080
Certainly, Miss Evans.

130
00:14:46,185 --> 00:14:48,153
Very bad!

131
00:14:55,361 --> 00:14:57,659
Is that Sally Oates again?

132
00:14:57,763 --> 00:14:59,993
I'm afraid so, Miss Evans.

133
00:15:01,433 --> 00:15:03,663
Well! Wicked child.

134
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:05,737
Fetch the strap.

135
00:15:09,108 --> 00:15:12,509
Bad, bad, very bad.

136
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:23,388
This is my special book.

137
00:15:25,624 --> 00:15:27,751
You can borrow it if you like.

138
00:15:34,533 --> 00:15:38,094
"'The 12 Dancing Princesses.'

139
00:15:38,203 --> 00:15:41,832
"There was a king who had
12 beautiful daughters...

140
00:15:43,175 --> 00:15:46,235
"and when they went to bed...

141
00:15:46,345 --> 00:15:49,246
"the doors were shut
and locked up.

142
00:15:49,348 --> 00:15:53,876
"But every morning their shoes
were found to be quite worn through...

143
00:15:53,986 --> 00:15:58,480
"as if they had been danced in
all night.

144
00:15:58,590 --> 00:16:02,924
"And yet nobody could find out
how it happened...

145
00:16:03,028 --> 00:16:05,724
or where they had been. "

146
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:12,502
Mum says they come from a stork.

147
00:16:12,604 --> 00:16:14,504
No. You have to fuck.

148
00:16:14,606 --> 00:16:16,506
What's "fuck"?

149
00:16:16,608 --> 00:16:21,375
When a man gets on top of a woman
and he puts his thing into her...

150
00:16:21,480 --> 00:16:25,746
and he puts a frenchie on his thing
to stop her having a baby.

151
00:16:27,019 --> 00:16:29,283
Pounds, shillings and pence!

152
00:16:29,388 --> 00:16:31,652
A man fell over the fence!

153
00:16:31,757 --> 00:16:34,555
He fell on a lady
and squashed out a baby!

154
00:16:34,660 --> 00:16:37,185
Pounds, shillings and pence!

155
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,787
Pounds, shillings and pence!

156
00:16:39,965 --> 00:16:44,493
All right, tonight, for homework,
I want you to write a poem.

157
00:16:44,603 --> 00:16:46,503
Copy this down.

158
00:16:46,605 --> 00:16:50,905
When... the... sun...

159
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,745
goes... down...

160
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,681
Have you got that?

161
00:16:57,783 --> 00:17:01,981
and... the... night...

162
00:17:03,889 --> 00:17:05,857
draws...

163
00:17:07,159 --> 00:17:09,059
nigh.

164
00:17:09,161 --> 00:17:11,061
There. Thanks.

165
00:17:11,163 --> 00:17:13,563
- That's the first line of your poem.
- Look. Look.

166
00:17:13,665 --> 00:17:17,328
What's that? Oh, I've got chalk
all over me. So I have.

167
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:20,405
- You got all that down? Good.

168
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:29,211
- What's that?
- It's a poem I wrote for school.

169
00:17:30,416 --> 00:17:32,441
Read it to us.

170
00:17:33,452 --> 00:17:37,047
"When the sun goes down
and the night draws nigh...

171
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:39,249
and the evening shadows
touch the sky -"

172
00:17:39,358 --> 00:17:43,351
It should be
"Evening shadows tint the sky."

173
00:17:43,462 --> 00:17:45,362
Why?

174
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:48,365
There are always words
that go together in poetry...

175
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:53,734
Like waves lap, stars shine or twinkle,
and wind roars.

176
00:17:53,839 --> 00:17:55,739
Rub out "touch"
and put in "tint."

177
00:17:55,841 --> 00:17:57,934
But I like "touch."

178
00:17:58,043 --> 00:18:01,706
It sounds wrong.
"Evening shadows tint the sky."

179
00:18:02,581 --> 00:18:05,482
Go on. Rub out "touch"
and put in "tint. "

180
00:18:05,584 --> 00:18:07,552
It sounds more poetic.

181
00:18:21,333 --> 00:18:24,234
- No.Johnny- Uh,Jean, come on. Come on.

182
00:18:24,336 --> 00:18:28,329
Come on,Jean. Up here.
In a big, loud voice. There we go.

- Well done. Well done.

197
00:19:09,281 --> 00:19:11,545
Now, anybody else
like to read their poems?

198
00:19:16,355 --> 00:19:19,290
- How's my little girl?
- What have you got?

00:19:38,577 --> 00:19:40,545
There you are.

205
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,140
That's to write
some more of your poems in.

206
00:20:29,995 --> 00:20:33,954
Myrtle and Ted did it
in the plannies this afternoon.

207

Did what?

208
00:20:37,135 --> 00:20:39,126
Fucked.

Our mother's a Christadelphian.

Are you allowed

I'm getting confirmed soon.

Escritoire?

312
00:31:10,869 --> 00:31:13,303
That's what I said.

313
00:31:13,404 --> 00:31:16,840
It's from escrit- to write -
in French.

She's got the best bosom.

317
00:31:55,914 --> 00:31:59,475
Mmm. I wouldn't give her
full marks for deportment, though.

318

She's got the most developed figure.

319

00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:06,250
 Sexy!
- Ooh-la-la!

I'll show you how I do the turn.

322
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:14,556
Ooh, that was good.
Do it again.

323
00:32:19,270 --> 00:32:21,636
- Very fancy!

324
00:32:21,739 --> 00:32:24,173
- Nice legs!

325
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:27,870
Uh, to your left a bit.
No, no, the other way.

326
00:32:27,979 --> 00:32:29,879
No, no, no, no!
Your Left!

327
00:32:29,981 --> 00:32:31,881
- The other way!

328
00:32:31,983 --> 00:32:35,180
- You don't want me in this one.
- Come on. You ready?

329
00:32:35,286 --> 00:32:39,245
Okay, everyone say...

330
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:41,587
- cheese.
- Cheese!

331
00:32:52,837 --> 00:32:55,465
Oh, look. There's Dad.

332
00:32:56,674 --> 00:32:58,574
Oh!

333
00:32:58,676 --> 00:33:01,577
Ooh, look,Jean.
You've got a titty showing.

334
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:05,513
- Put that way.
- Titty, titty. Titty, titty, titty.

335
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:08,176
- Where's Myrtle?
- Myrtle's not there.

336
00:33:08,286 --> 00:33:10,254
Where?

337
00:33:31,476 --> 00:33:35,503
- Coming to the baths?
- I have to get ready for school.

338
00:33:35,613 --> 00:33:37,581
We could go swimming...

339
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:41,585
and then go downtown
and look at the boys.

340
00:33:51,229 --> 00:33:53,129
- Watch out!
- Coming?

341
00:33:53,231 --> 00:33:55,563
No. I want to do this.

342
00:34:02,407 --> 00:34:05,467
Ooh! Aunt Polly's
only put in two pleats!

343
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:09,103
How original!

344
00:34:17,088 --> 00:34:19,989
Oh, come on, Nini.
Come to the baths with us.

345
00:34:20,091 --> 00:34:22,559
- You don't want to work.
- I do.

346
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:26,396
You're so boring.

347
00:34:28,099 --> 00:34:31,000
- Come on, Isabel.
- I'm coming.

348
00:34:56,260 --> 00:34:58,820
C'est un petit garзon.

349
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:02,764
Il a le chapeau de son pиre.

350
00:35:02,867 --> 00:35:04,767
- Ce garзon est mauvais.

351
00:35:04,869 --> 00:35:07,633
- Nothing today, thank you.

352
00:35:14,278 --> 00:35:16,940
Nothing today, thank you.

353
00:35:20,885 --> 00:35:23,183
Send that child away.

354
00:35:25,656 --> 00:35:27,556
I'm a doctor.

355
00:35:27,658 --> 00:35:30,559
I 've come to tell you
about your daughter Myrtle.

356
00:35:30,661 --> 00:35:32,629
She's drowned at the baths.

357
00:35:34,332 --> 00:35:37,301
- They've taken her body to the morgue.

358
00:35:40,171 --> 00:35:43,140
Is there anybody I can contact for you?

359
00:35:56,387 --> 00:35:58,617
They've taken her to the morgue.

360
00:37:25,810 --> 00:37:27,710
Come on.

361
00:37:40,625 --> 00:37:42,593
Is it Myrtle?

362
00:37:45,463 --> 00:37:47,863
Yes.

363
00:37:47,965 --> 00:37:51,128
- What are you putting in the water?
- Aspro.

364
00:37:53,271 --> 00:37:55,330
It won't bring her back,Jean.

365
00:37:55,439 --> 00:37:59,899
I know that. But the aspros
make the flowers last longer.

366
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,247
Come on.

367
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:20,094
-That's very nice, isn't it?
- It's quite excellent.

368
00:38:20,197 --> 00:38:22,597
They had to make her a new arm.

369
00:38:22,700 --> 00:38:24,600
For goodness' sake.

370
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:28,138
The photographer took her
out of a picture with the other kiddies...

371
00:38:28,239 --> 00:38:30,139
and gave her a new arm here.

372
00:38:30,241 --> 00:38:32,141
Oh, you couldn't tell.

373
00:38:32,243 --> 00:38:36,145
It must be a comfort to you, Lottie,
to have such a recent one.

374
00:38:36,247 --> 00:38:38,147
Oh, it is,yes.

375
00:38:38,249 --> 00:38:39,350
She looks so lovely.

376
00:38:39,350 --> 00:38:40,146
She looks so lovely.

377
00:38:40,251 --> 00:38:42,685
- Oh, she was a beautiful girl.
- Yes.

378
00:38:42,787 --> 00:38:46,154
- She's always smiling.

379
00:38:46,257 --> 00:38:48,452
"Till of a sudden...

380
00:38:48,559 --> 00:38:52,256
"maybe killed,
unknown to her mate.

381
00:38:52,363 --> 00:38:55,059
"One forenoon the she-bird crouched...

382
00:38:55,166 --> 00:38:57,066
"not on the nest.

383
00:38:57,168 --> 00:39:00,365
Nor returned that afternoon,
nor the next - "

384
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:03,099
Jean, is that about Myrtle?

385
00:39:04,842 --> 00:39:07,936
"Nor ever appeared again.

386
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:10,445
"Whichever way I turn...

387
00:39:10,548 --> 00:39:13,915
"oh, I think you could
give me my mate back again...

388
00:39:14,018 --> 00:39:15,918
"if only you would.

389
00:39:16,020 --> 00:39:21,117
For I am almost sure I see her dimly
whichever way I look."

390
00:39:28,733 --> 00:39:31,395
- Hello, Jean.
- Hello, Poppy.

391
00:39:36,474 --> 00:39:38,442
Do you know I'm doing Commercial?

392
00:39:39,343 --> 00:39:41,675
Yes.

393
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:45,977
I'm doing shorthand, typing
and double-entry bookkeeping.

394
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,953
Do you like Commercial?

395
00:39:51,055 --> 00:39:52,955
Except for all the grammalogues.

396
00:39:53,057 --> 00:39:55,025
We're always doing grammalogues.

397
00:39:56,894 --> 00:39:58,953
We're doing "Ode to a Nightingale" too.

398
00:40:00,865 --> 00:40:03,925
"Thou wast not born for death,
immortal bird.

399
00:40:04,034 --> 00:40:07,060
"No hungry generations
tread thee down.

400
00:40:07,171 --> 00:40:10,197
"The voice I heard
this passing night...

401
00:40:10,307 --> 00:40:14,403
was heard in ancient days
by emperor and clown."

402
00:40:14,512 --> 00:40:17,481
We have to learn it by heart
for next Tuesday.

403
00:40:21,619 --> 00:40:25,282
- I have to go.
- All right.

404
00:40:25,389 --> 00:40:27,914
- Bye then.
- Bye.

405
00:40:33,798 --> 00:40:35,766
Shirley.

406
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:39,295
Shirley!

407
00:40:40,671 --> 00:40:42,832
What a dreamer you are, Shirley.

408
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:47,070
Always lost in the poetic world
of your imagination.

409
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:05,595
Thou holy art

410
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:08,096
In many

411
00:41:08,199 --> 00:41:13,102
An hour of sadness

412
00:41:14,672 --> 00:41:18,870
When life's hard toil

413
00:41:18,976 --> 00:41:25,472
My spirit hath oppressed

414
00:41:29,286 --> 00:41:31,447
Hast thou

415
00:41:31,555 --> 00:41:34,718
My heart

416
00:41:34,825 --> 00:41:37,157
Revived

417
00:41:37,261 --> 00:41:42,528
With love and gladness

418
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:46,763
- And borne my soul
- Shirley's leaving. Her mother died.

419
00:41:46,871 --> 00:41:50,637
Above to realms

420
00:41:50,741 --> 00:41:54,006
Of rest

421
00:41:54,111 --> 00:41:57,547
And borne my soul off

422
00:41:57,648 --> 00:42:03,018
To realms of rest

423
00:42:31,215 --> 00:42:33,183
Come on, girl.

424
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:38,121
Come on. That's a good girl.

425
00:42:48,365 --> 00:42:50,333
Good girl.

426
00:43:07,151 --> 00:43:09,483
Dearest Mr. Ardenue...

427
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:13,546
today I wept in class
when we read "The Scholar Gypsy."

428
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:18,189
He is my ideal man.

429
00:43:18,295 --> 00:43:21,856
I have made up my mind
not to be a teacher.

430
00:43:21,966 --> 00:43:24,264
I'm going to be a poet.

431
00:43:46,390 --> 00:43:48,358
Mum!

432
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:52,293
Mum! There's blood
between my legs!

433
00:43:53,731 --> 00:43:56,029
Come on. Let's get you
out of that nightie.

434
00:43:56,133 --> 00:43:59,102
I suppose you've
mucked the sheets up as well.

435
00:44:00,137 --> 00:44:04,540
Now, take one end, and you pin it
to the front of your singlet.

436
00:44:04,642 --> 00:44:06,542
Here. Turn round.

437
00:44:06,644 --> 00:44:08,612
That's it. Like that.

438
00:44:12,850 --> 00:44:14,750
Put it between your legs.
That's it.

439
00:44:14,852 --> 00:44:17,753
And then you pin the other end
to the back of the singlet.

440
00:44:17,855 --> 00:44:21,757
Now, you do this first, and then you pull
your clean knickers up over the top.

441
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:23,759
- It will show.
- No, it won't.

442
00:44:23,861 --> 00:44:25,761
Everyone will see!

443
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:29,094
Be thankful you started at 15.
Others start at 12.

444
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,667
I'll get you some clean knickers.

445
00:44:37,941 --> 00:44:39,841
For your homework this evening...

446
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:42,844
I'd like you to continue
working on your projects...

447
00:44:42,946 --> 00:44:45,141
on photo synthesis.

448
00:44:45,249 --> 00:44:47,683
Any problems,
go to your chemistry books...

449
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:51,846
page 164, chapter 18.

450
00:44:51,955 --> 00:44:54,150
That's it for today.

451
00:44:54,258 --> 00:44:56,590
Carry on, girls.

452
00:44:56,694 --> 00:44:59,663
- Put your. chairs in. Thank you.

453
00:45:04,068 --> 00:45:06,696
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye!

454
00:45:12,209 --> 00:45:16,043
Well, why don't we - You know.

455
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:18,114
Yeah, okay.

456
00:45:22,219 --> 00:45:24,187
Hi, fuzzy.

457
00:45:25,989 --> 00:45:28,890
You know, you should do something
about your hair.

458
00:45:28,992 --> 00:45:31,119
You could get it straightened.

459
00:45:32,663 --> 00:45:35,188
Or clip it to make it stay flat.

460
00:45:39,670 --> 00:45:41,797
Or oil it or something.

461
00:45:43,006 --> 00:45:45,975
I've never really seen hair like this.

462
00:45:47,811 --> 00:45:50,905
- Look.
- Oh, well. Hmm.

463
00:45:53,383 --> 00:45:56,250
Oh, that's great!
Where did you get that?

464
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:05,417
No, but-

465
00:46:07,564 --> 00:46:09,464
My brother says...

466
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:14,731
that Karl Marx is the only rational,
scientific thinker of the last two centuries.

467
00:46:17,908 --> 00:46:20,536
- William's got a lovely personality.

468
00:46:20,644 --> 00:46:23,738
- I saw him at the train station.

469
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:27,180
I dropped my glove, and he gave it
back to me. Such a gentleman!

470
00:46:27,284 --> 00:46:30,981
- He's like a movie star.

471
00:46:31,088 --> 00:46:33,989
Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers,
they've got lovely personalities.

472
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:37,424
- And it comes out in their style.
- It does, doesn't it?

473
00:46:42,866 --> 00:46:45,494
How many times
do I have to tell you?

474
00:46:45,602 --> 00:46:49,504
He doesn't have to have fits!
He could stop them if he tried!

475
00:46:49,606 --> 00:46:51,164
You don't even care!

476
00:46:59,016 --> 00:47:02,315
Now look what you've done!
You're going to stop this!

477
00:47:08,292 --> 00:47:12,194
Corporal Frame, National Reserve,
at your service.

478
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:17,324
- They've put Bruddie in the Home Guard.
- Oh, we'll show Hitler!

479
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:19,527
- We'll show Hitler!
- We'll show him!

480
00:47:19,636 --> 00:47:21,536
Come on, son. Hup! Hup!

481
00:47:21,638 --> 00:47:24,129
By the left, left, march!
Left, march!

482
00:47:24,241 --> 00:47:27,005
- Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!
- Hup! Hup! Hup! Hup!

483
00:47:27,110 --> 00:47:29,010
Look out, Hitler!

484
00:47:29,112 --> 00:47:32,172
It's a long way to Taumaranui

485
00:47:32,282 --> 00:47:34,182
It's a long way to go

486
00:47:34,284 --> 00:47:36,548
- Left, march! Left, march!

487
00:47:36,653 --> 00:47:39,816
- Left, march! Left, march! Hup! Hup!

488
00:47:39,923 --> 00:47:42,448
Left, right, left, right!

489
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:49,030
Life is sweet,Jasper.

490
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:52,693
There's day and night,Jasper.
Both sweet things.

491
00:47:54,404 --> 00:47:58,101
There's sun, moon and stars, brother,
all sweet things.

492
00:47:59,643 --> 00:48:02,510
There's likewise a wind on the heath.

493
00:48:03,647 --> 00:48:06,115
Who would wish to die?

494
00:48:10,454 --> 00:48:12,354
Blah, blah, blah.

495
00:48:12,456 --> 00:48:14,720
Three skirts, three blouses...

496
00:48:14,825 --> 00:48:18,158
two day dresses -
one winter white, one summerwhite -

497
00:48:18,262 --> 00:48:21,163
one special occasion dress...

498
00:48:21,265 --> 00:48:23,665
two jerseys or cardigans...

499
00:48:23,767 --> 00:48:27,726
one pair court shoes,
one pairwalking shoes.

500
00:48:29,172 --> 00:48:32,073
And that's apart from
all the underwear and night clothes.

501
00:48:32,175 --> 00:48:34,575
I found Grandpa's
old dressing gown!

502
00:48:34,678 --> 00:48:36,805
No, Chicks, no.

503
00:48:41,285 --> 00:48:44,982
Two sisters back in our town

504
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:48,922
Were feeling sorry and blue

505
00:48:49,026 --> 00:48:50,926
- Hello, Fuzz.
- Oh, hello, Fuzz.

506
00:48:51,028 --> 00:48:52,928
The army took their boys away

507
00:48:53,030 --> 00:48:56,488
What else was there to do

508
00:48:56,600 --> 00:49:01,765
They cal led up the sergeant
Called up the captain

509
00:49:01,872 --> 00:49:04,773
Called up the major too

510
00:49:04,875 --> 00:49:08,436
And they asked
what right had the army

511
00:49:08,545 --> 00:49:10,945
To be making them so blue

512
00:49:11,048 --> 00:49:12,948
- Hello,Jean.

513
00:49:13,050 --> 00:49:16,042
I believe it's training college
for you next year,Jean.

514
00:49:16,153 --> 00:49:19,554
Well, I still have to go
for my interview.

515
00:49:19,656 --> 00:49:21,783
Oh, I'm sure you'll be successful.

516
00:49:21,892 --> 00:49:25,293
-  In the land of the free
- Do you like music,Jean?

517
00:49:25,395 --> 00:49:26,953
Oh, yes.

518
00:49:27,064 --> 00:49:29,965
-  We're gonna take a short vacation
- I like Schubert.

519
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:33,969
- Yes, he's one of my favorites too.

520
00:49:34,071 --> 00:49:36,505
So emotional.

521
00:49:36,606 --> 00:49:40,042
They'll regret it, no doubt

522
00:49:42,946 --> 00:49:44,846
Well, I think I'll mix.

523
00:49:44,948 --> 00:49:47,849
-  She gets a letter

524
00:49:47,951 --> 00:49:49,543
She's feeling better

525
00:49:49,653 --> 00:49:52,781
He's coming home on leave

526
00:49:52,889 --> 00:49:56,290
So we'll string along with the army

527
00:49:56,393 --> 00:50:02,161
In the fight for victory

528
00:50:42,506 --> 00:50:45,737
Pretty face! Pretty face!
Pretty face!

529
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:55,750
Don't work too hard.
Have a nice time.

530
00:50:55,852 --> 00:50:58,844
- You all right?.
- It is a bit of a wedge, isn't it?

531
00:50:58,955 --> 00:51:01,219
Bye! See you!

532
00:51:01,324 --> 00:51:03,451
You've got to write!
Remember!

533
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:05,528
- Bye!
- Bye-bye.

534
00:52:50,233 --> 00:52:52,394
- George?

535
00:52:52,502 --> 00:52:55,699
Jean has come to see you.

536
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:58,741
- This way.
- Huh?

537
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:01,367
Hello, Uncle George.

538
00:53:02,345 --> 00:53:07,146
So, you're the one who's going
to be a teacher.

539
00:53:07,250 --> 00:53:09,810
She'll be the first in the family.

540
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:17,883
There we are. Ooh, it's cold.

541
00:53:32,442 --> 00:53:35,707
Yeah, but it's gonna be raining,
so I'll need the umbrella.

542
00:53:35,812 --> 00:53:38,042
- Hi! Fuzzy!
- Well, hello, Fuzz.

543
00:53:38,148 --> 00:53:40,844
- Isn't college fun?
- Oh, yes, isn't it!

544
00:53:40,951 --> 00:53:43,681
I'm doing two subjects
at university too.

545
00:53:43,787 --> 00:53:45,687
- No!
- Oh, you're such a brain.

546
00:53:45,789 --> 00:53:48,519
Do you want to come
and have a cup of coffee? Come on!

547
00:53:48,625 --> 00:53:51,924
- We're going to the Silver Girl now.
- Oh, come on!

548
00:53:56,299 --> 00:53:59,962
You know,Jean, you're welcome
to eat with me in the wee room.

549
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:03,071
Um, no, thank you, Aunt Isy.

550
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:05,801
I like to study while I eat.

551
00:54:08,845 --> 00:54:11,814
You vegetarians,
you eat like birds.

552
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:34,736
Come on. Come on.

553
00:54:34,838 --> 00:54:36,738
Come on, sleepy.

554
00:54:36,840 --> 00:54:41,243
Dear, have you got anything to burn?

555
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:43,869
Uh, no, thank you, Aunt Isy.
I haven't.

556
00:55:26,456 --> 00:55:28,356
"May I...

557
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:31,427
"composed like them...

558
00:55:31,528 --> 00:55:33,928
"of Eros and of dust...

559
00:55:36,132 --> 00:55:39,761
"beleaguered by the same
negation and despair...

560
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:44,670
show an affirming flame."

561
00:55:53,516 --> 00:55:55,416
There's Africa!

562
00:55:55,518 --> 00:55:57,418
You.

563
00:55:57,520 --> 00:56:01,149
That one's like a - like a -

564
00:56:01,257 --> 00:56:03,282
Oh, it's phallic. Everything's phallic.

565
00:56:03,393 --> 00:56:05,293
What's "phallic"?

566
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:08,296
It's from "phallus," the Latin for "penis."

567
00:56:08,398 --> 00:56:10,298
- Like a dong?

568
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:12,698
Oh, look.
Even our knees are phallic.

569
00:56:14,804 --> 00:56:17,204
You'll read Freud at college.

570
00:56:17,307 --> 00:56:19,400
Oh, I can't wait to get there.

571
00:56:19,509 --> 00:56:21,602
I'll be all alone.

572
00:56:21,711 --> 00:56:24,179
Poor baby. All alone.

573
00:56:24,280 --> 00:56:26,407
No.

574
00:56:27,717 --> 00:56:30,618
- You can have Jack when I'm gone.

575
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:33,689
We have coffee in the union aftertutes.

576
00:56:35,425 --> 00:56:37,393
And you should see Mr. Forrest.

577
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:40,925
- He's the psych lecturer.
- Mmm!

578
00:56:42,332 --> 00:56:44,300
He's gorgeous!

579
00:56:46,669 --> 00:56:48,569
He's like Ashley in Gone With the Wind!

580
00:56:51,207 --> 00:56:54,734
Ashley! Ashley!
Come to me, Ashley!

581
00:56:54,844 --> 00:56:58,302
- Ashley, I need you!

582
00:57:02,385 --> 00:57:04,683
I'm not gonna share.

583
00:57:04,788 --> 00:57:08,485
- There's enough room.
- What for? Midgets?

584
00:57:08,591 --> 00:57:10,491
Hey.

585
00:57:10,593 --> 00:57:12,493
See?

586
00:57:12,595 --> 00:57:14,495
Try it.

587
00:57:14,597 --> 00:57:16,929
She must be mad.

588
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:18,933
I'm gonna tell Mum.

589
00:57:19,035 --> 00:57:21,003
Oh, no, don't say anything.

590
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,436
Why not? We paid.

591
00:57:23,540 --> 00:57:25,508
But not very much.

592
00:57:27,110 --> 00:57:29,670
Isabel, please!

593
00:57:39,322 --> 00:57:41,847
She won them
for her highland dancin'.

594
00:57:42,959 --> 00:57:46,122
They've never been opened.
Look.

595
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:52,057
- Let's open one.
- No, we can't.

596
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:54,068
She won't know.

597
00:57:58,942 --> 00:58:01,843
I suppose we could taste one.

598
00:58:01,945 --> 00:58:04,243
Yes, let's taste one.

599
00:58:04,347 --> 00:58:06,315
Give us a hand.

600
00:58:07,550 --> 00:58:09,643
Got it.

601
00:58:13,990 --> 00:58:15,958
Hello, little kitty.

602
00:58:28,338 --> 00:58:30,238
You choose first.

603
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,308
Go on.

604
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:39,108
With the cross of Jesus

605
00:58:39,215 --> 00:58:43,242
- Going on before
- Mmm!

606
00:58:43,353 --> 00:58:46,914
Mmm. It's not musty at all.

607
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,994
You taste one.

608
00:58:54,931 --> 00:58:56,831
We shouldn't be doing this.

609
00:58:56,933 --> 00:58:59,527
I know. Go on.

610
00:59:17,687 --> 00:59:20,918
Steve wants me to go all the way.

611
00:59:21,024 --> 00:59:24,619
- We nearly did it tonight.

612
00:59:27,397 --> 00:59:30,389
We only just stopped in time.

613
00:59:33,069 --> 00:59:36,766
- This house is like a morgue.

614
00:59:40,209 --> 00:59:43,042
What about your essay?

615
00:59:43,146 --> 00:59:47,048
It's too late.
I'll do it tomorrow in the union.

616
00:59:49,152 --> 00:59:52,121
Why don't you
ever come in to the union?

617
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:56,091
Where do you go?

618
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:13,474
Too shy to mix...

619
01:00:13,576 --> 01:00:16,374
too scared to enter.
the union building...

620
01:00:17,547 --> 01:00:19,515
I was more and more alone.

621
01:00:22,185 --> 01:00:25,348
My only romance
was in poetry and literature.

622
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:35,464
Hello.

623
01:00:36,866 --> 01:00:39,835
Oh. I was just going, Mr. Forrest.

624
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:43,702
Oh, that's all right.
There's no rules about eating in here.

625
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:45,774
It's a bit smelly, though.

626
01:01:03,326 --> 01:01:06,295
What do you think he does
with all that lanolin?

627
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:11,228
Maybe he rubs it on his thing.

628
01:01:11,334 --> 01:01:14,235
Or maybe Aunt Isy
rubs it on for him.

629
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:21,639
- What's that?
- Aunt Isy

630
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:23,575
Oh!

631
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:25,941
- Hurry up.

632
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:32,021
Quick.

633
01:01:33,423 --> 01:01:35,391
Hurryup! She's coming!

634
01:01:36,426 --> 01:01:38,326
Here!
Here, here, here, here, here!

635
01:01:38,428 --> 01:01:40,828
By our good Lord.

636
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:16,564
You're just liars!

637
01:02:16,666 --> 01:02:18,566
And thieves!

638
01:02:18,668 --> 01:02:21,865
Telling your parents
those untruths!

639
01:02:21,971 --> 01:02:24,838
Stealing my trophies!

640
01:02:24,941 --> 01:02:28,069
Wicked, wicked girls!

641
01:02:42,658 --> 01:02:44,626
Wait.

642
01:02:46,262 --> 01:02:48,628
Come on, Siggy! Come on!

643
01:02:52,735 --> 01:02:55,295
Willowglen sat high on a hill.

644
01:02:55,404 --> 01:02:58,999
It had belonged in turn
to various derelict families.

645
01:02:59,108 --> 01:03:02,839
Now it was ours,
the first home we had owned.

646
01:03:09,352 --> 01:03:11,320
Here we are.

647
01:03:21,764 --> 01:03:24,164
They found out about me, Mum.

648
01:03:24,267 --> 01:03:26,064
Ah, never mind, laddie.

649
01:03:26,169 --> 01:03:27,966
- Not again.
- Curly!

650
01:03:28,070 --> 01:03:30,300
Epilepsy's nothing to be ashamed of.

651
01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:33,307
He can't even
keep a job for two days. Two days!

652
01:03:33,409 --> 01:03:34,876
No!

653
01:03:38,514 --> 01:03:40,482
What's the use?

654
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:54,395
Come down onto the flat
and sit in the sun.

655
01:03:54,497 --> 01:03:57,398
One of these days
I'll come and sit in the sun.

656
01:03:57,500 --> 01:04:00,958
- Why not now?
- I've too much to do.

657
01:04:04,607 --> 01:04:07,576
No one's asking you
to be a workhorse.

658
01:04:12,615 --> 01:04:15,516
I worried about next year..

659
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:19,145
My clothes, money...

660
01:04:19,255 --> 01:04:23,214
and where I would live
now Isabel wanted to share with friends.

661
01:04:28,631 --> 01:04:31,031
How about a bit of Tchaikovsky?

662
01:04:36,172 --> 01:04:38,072
Hello, Eunice, Mary.

663
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:40,233
What do you think
of my tomato socks?

664
01:04:40,343 --> 01:04:42,174
Lovely.

665
01:04:42,278 --> 01:04:45,179
- Unusual.
- Unusual?

666
01:04:45,281 --> 01:04:47,340
-And bright.
- Ofcourse they're bright.

667
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:02,624
I love this bit there.

668
01:05:28,658 --> 01:05:30,626
Miss Frame?

669
01:05:32,662 --> 01:05:34,630
Oh, there you are.

670
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:38,997
Are you coming to morning tea?

671
01:05:40,102 --> 01:05:43,936
Oh - Oh, uh, no.
I'm a bit busy.

672
01:05:44,040 --> 01:05:47,806
Oh. We never see you.

673
01:05:49,211 --> 01:05:51,179
Maybe tomorrow.

674
01:05:53,716 --> 01:05:56,014
Oh, you've made the room lovely.

675
01:06:13,102 --> 01:06:16,003
So this was how it was...

676
01:06:16,105 --> 01:06:19,131
face to face with the future.

677
01:06:19,241 --> 01:06:21,300
Living apart from Isabel...

678
01:06:21,410 --> 01:06:23,776
pretending that I was not alone...

679
01:06:23,879 --> 01:06:27,508
and that teaching was what
I'd longed to do all my life.

680
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:32,314
- Izzy! Isabel!
- What did they say?

681
01:06:32,421 --> 01:06:35,322
- Izzy!
- Have you heard about the bomb?

682
01:06:35,424 --> 01:06:37,824
- What bomb?
- They dropped a bomb on Japan!

683
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:39,827
- They've killed millions of Japanese!

684
01:06:39,929 --> 01:06:42,557
- It's a new kind of bomb!
- So have we won the war?

685
01:06:42,665 --> 01:06:45,293
- Yes!
- Let's go tell the others!

686
01:06:46,469 --> 01:06:48,369
Coming?

687
01:06:49,972 --> 01:06:52,941
- Isabel, come on!
- Where did you hear it?

688
01:07:21,871 --> 01:07:26,171
We have a very important visitor
with us today, Second Class.

689
01:07:26,275 --> 01:07:30,905
I'd like you to say good morning
to our inspector, Mr. Niles.

690
01:07:31,013 --> 01:07:34,414
Good morning, Mr. Niles.

691
01:07:34,517 --> 01:07:36,917
Good morning, children.
Good, thanks.

692
01:07:37,019 --> 01:07:39,920
- And how are you, Miss Frame?
- Very well, thank you.

693
01:07:40,022 --> 01:07:43,423
That's good. I'll sit at the back,
and you just carry on as normal.

694
01:07:43,526 --> 01:07:45,494
Forget I'm here.

695
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:55,258
What's she doing?

696
01:09:08,377 --> 01:09:11,938
M-Mr Niles, would you
excuse me for a minute, please?

697
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:14,607
Certainly, Miss Frame.

698
01:11:19,375 --> 01:11:21,809
What about teaching?

699
01:11:22,678 --> 01:11:24,908
I've given it up.

700
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:27,448
I've got a doctor's certificate.

701
01:11:27,549 --> 01:11:30,518
But you've always wanted
to be a teacher.

702
01:11:31,754 --> 01:11:35,281
- I'm going to be a writer.
- But how will you earn money?

703
01:11:40,462 --> 01:11:43,659
- How will you live?
- I'll work here in the kitchen.

704
01:11:43,766 --> 01:11:47,293
- I'll study psych at university.
- What about your scholarship?

705
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:51,539
What about Mum and Dad?

706
01:12:00,449 --> 01:12:02,576
I can't believe it.

707
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:19,057
I really enjoyed
your autobiography, Janet.

708
01:12:19,168 --> 01:12:22,399
It's very natural.
It's got a nice flow to it.

709
01:12:22,504 --> 01:12:24,972
The others were all
so stiff and serious.

710
01:12:25,074 --> 01:12:27,065
You've got a real talent for writing.

711
01:12:28,277 --> 01:12:30,802
I've had a story published
in The Listener.

712
01:12:30,913 --> 01:12:33,643
Oh. So I'm not wrong then.

713
01:12:38,387 --> 01:12:41,254
You must have had difficulty
swallowing all those aspros.

714
01:12:44,793 --> 01:12:49,025
No. I - I just drank them with water.
It wasn't hard.

715
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:51,099
They just went down.

716
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:10,280
"You have a real talent for writing."

717
01:13:27,870 --> 01:13:30,338
"You have a real talent
for writing."

718
01:13:32,141 --> 01:13:34,371
-Janet.
- Yes?

719
01:13:34,476 --> 01:13:37,343
Three men from the university
to see you.

720
01:13:45,854 --> 01:13:47,981
Ah.

721
01:13:48,090 --> 01:13:50,558
- Hello, Janet.
- Evening, Janet.

722
01:13:50,659 --> 01:13:52,627
- Hello,Janet.
- Hello.

723
01:13:55,063 --> 01:13:57,258
Uh, Mr. Forrest has been telling me...

724
01:13:57,366 --> 01:14:00,335
that, uh, you haven't been
feeling all that well lately...

725
01:14:00,436 --> 01:14:04,133
and, well, we thought
that you might like a little rest.

726
01:14:05,808 --> 01:14:09,471
Oh. N-No, I'm fine now, thank you.

727
01:14:09,578 --> 01:14:12,479
Well, i-it wouldn't be for long.
Just, uh -

728
01:14:12,581 --> 01:14:16,415
Well, just have a little rest
and let us look after you for a while.

729
01:14:18,253 --> 01:14:20,153
Really, I'm all right.

730
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:22,519
John would come to visit you.
Wouldn't you, John?

731
01:14:22,624 --> 01:14:24,524
Of course I would, yeah.

732
01:14:24,626 --> 01:14:26,594
In hospital?

733
01:14:28,030 --> 01:14:31,466
Well, yes, we think
it would be best for you.

734
01:14:33,769 --> 01:14:36,567
- Do you think so?
- I do.

735
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:31,958
Come on, Nini.

736
01:15:36,231 --> 01:15:38,426
I can't go home.

737
01:15:38,534 --> 01:15:41,401
- Well, you can't stay here.
- No, I don't want to stay here.

738
01:15:41,503 --> 01:15:44,199
Well, where can you go?

739
01:15:44,306 --> 01:15:48,402
Look, after a holiday at home,
you'll be as good as new.

740
01:15:52,214 --> 01:15:54,512
Go away!

741
01:15:57,185 --> 01:16:01,986
- She's usually such a happy girl.
- Go away!

742
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:04,957
We'd better go.

743
01:16:06,862 --> 01:16:09,330
Perhaps she just needs a little more rest.

744
01:16:18,307 --> 01:16:22,641
- I had a little dog -
- And his name was -
- Spot.

745
01:16:22,744 --> 01:16:25,736
- I had a little dog -
- And his name was -

746
01:16:25,847 --> 01:16:27,815
- Spot.
- I had a little dog -

747
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:30,316
- And his name was -
- Spot.

748
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:34,412
- I had a little dog, and his name was -
- Spot.

749
01:16:34,523 --> 01:16:37,492
- I had a little dog -
- And his name was -

750
01:16:37,593 --> 01:16:40,255
- Spot.
- I had a little dog -

751
01:16:40,362 --> 01:16:42,387
- And his name was -
- Spot.

752
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:46,301
Here we go again.

753
01:16:48,303 --> 01:16:50,203
Come back!

754
01:16:54,309 --> 01:16:57,506
Here we go. Here we go.

755
01:17:32,180 --> 01:17:34,978
Pits.

756
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:42,151
I 've got schizophrenia.

757
01:17:42,257 --> 01:17:44,157
What's that?

758
01:17:48,764 --> 01:17:53,133
"Dementia praecox,
otherwise known as schizophrenia.

759
01:17:53,235 --> 01:17:55,897
"A gradual deterioration of the mind...

760
01:17:56,004 --> 01:17:57,972
with no cure."

761
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:34,365
Janet.

762
01:18:34,476 --> 01:18:38,776
I've talked to a Mrs. Chandler.
in Christchurch about your case.

763
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:41,713
She's very interested in you.

764
01:18:41,817 --> 01:18:43,876
I think you'll like her too.

765
01:18:43,985 --> 01:18:46,249
Do you mean
I should go and see her?

766
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:48,345
I think you should.

767
01:18:48,457 --> 01:18:52,553
I've shown your stories and poems
to Denis Glover of Caxton.

768
01:18:52,661 --> 01:18:54,754
He's very impressed.

769
01:18:57,365 --> 01:19:01,392
You know, Janet, when I think of you,
I think of van Gogh, Hugo Wolf.

770
01:19:01,503 --> 01:19:04,131
Lots of artists have suffered
from schizophrenia.

771
01:19:11,213 --> 01:19:13,647
Bruddie?

772
01:19:17,953 --> 01:19:20,922
You should be the one going, Nini,
not me.

773
01:19:22,691 --> 01:19:24,659
Oh, no. I couldn't.

774
01:19:27,562 --> 01:19:29,587
You'd be the best one.

775
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:33,725
Whoever goes, you've got to make sure
Mum has a lovely trip.

776
01:19:34,770 --> 01:19:38,968
- It's most of my money!

777
01:19:39,074 --> 01:19:42,237
- No, it's not. It's mostly Janet's money.
- Yeah.

778
01:19:42,344 --> 01:19:45,802
- No, it's not. I worked for it.
- I earn more money than you do.

779
01:19:45,914 --> 01:19:47,939
Work for it? Huh.

780
01:19:50,752 --> 01:19:53,220
Oh, dear, dear, dear.
I don't know.

781
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:55,619
-What don't you know?

782
01:19:55,724 --> 01:19:57,692
Put your feet up.

783
01:19:57,793 --> 01:20:00,421
- I'm all right.
- Come on.

784
01:20:01,763 --> 01:20:05,028
There. You're on holidays, Mum.

785
01:20:05,133 --> 01:20:09,797
Stop worrying.
Poor old trotters.

786
01:20:21,817 --> 01:20:24,786
- It's mine!

787
01:20:24,886 --> 01:20:26,786
Hello?

788
01:20:34,262 --> 01:20:36,162
Yeah.

789
01:20:36,264 --> 01:20:38,232
Yeah. Okay.

790
01:20:51,313 --> 01:20:53,281
It's Isabel.

791
01:20:55,050 --> 01:20:57,746
She drowned in Picton Harbour.

792
01:21:37,959 --> 01:21:40,484
It's to stop her from smelling.

793
01:21:45,500 --> 01:21:47,400
Bruddie.

794
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:52,607
Mum, your hair - it's white.

795
01:21:53,708 --> 01:21:55,676
- Oh, Curly!

796
01:21:55,777 --> 01:21:57,745
A second one taken.

797
01:22:01,216 --> 01:22:06,119
We just don't know what to say,
but call on us if you want any help.

798
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:09,088
- We're here. We're sorry
we didn't come to the church.
- Is Janet coming out?

799
01:22:09,190 --> 01:22:12,091
We knew you had
closer family and friends...

800
01:22:12,193 --> 01:22:16,527
and we kept in the background
for that reason.

801
01:22:19,768 --> 01:22:22,362
Why don't you come out, Nini?

802
01:22:46,928 --> 01:22:50,557
I comforted myself with writing...

803
01:22:50,665 --> 01:22:53,862
yet I could not stay at Willowglen...

804
01:22:53,969 --> 01:22:57,598
nor was there any escape
from the horror of my decayed teeth.

805
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:11,681
Hello. Come in.

806
01:23:16,725 --> 01:23:19,285
- I'm Janet Frame.
- Oh.

807
01:23:19,394 --> 01:23:21,862
John Forrest wrote to me about you.

808
01:23:24,299 --> 01:23:26,290
Will you help me with my teeth?

809
01:23:27,402 --> 01:23:31,361
Your teeth?
I don't understand.

810
01:23:37,412 --> 01:23:41,041
Oh, dear.

811
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:43,982
I'm afraid you're gonna have to
have those out.

812
01:23:44,085 --> 01:23:45,985
Will you come with me?

813
01:23:47,288 --> 01:23:49,381
Well, yes, I could.

814
01:23:56,664 --> 01:23:58,962
After you've had your teeth seen to...

815
01:23:59,067 --> 01:24:01,592
I'd like you to go
to Sunnyside Hospital.

816
01:24:01,703 --> 01:24:05,230
They have a new treatment there
which appears to be successful.

817
01:24:07,442 --> 01:24:09,342
Is it curable?

818
01:24:09,444 --> 01:24:13,744
With this new treatment,
yes, I think it may be.

819
01:24:38,873 --> 01:24:42,172
- Nurse?

820
01:24:51,853 --> 01:24:53,821
You're a newie, aren't you?

821
01:24:56,558 --> 01:24:58,822
Come on. Legs up.
That's the way. Get yourself comfy.

822
01:24:58,927 --> 01:25:02,385
- Where are your teeth?
- I've just had them pulled out.

823
01:25:02,497 --> 01:25:04,863
Ooh.

824
01:25:07,502 --> 01:25:10,266
- Have you eaten today?

825
01:25:10,371 --> 01:25:12,396
Oh! Oops-a-day.

826
01:25:14,008 --> 01:25:17,967
No! There's God! There's God!

827
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:20,309
- That's a good girl.
- There's God -

828
01:25:20,415 --> 01:25:22,440
-All right, Doctor.

829
01:25:22,550 --> 01:25:26,008
Good morning. Well, then,
we know what this is all about.

830
01:25:26,121 --> 01:25:28,316
Lie down. That's all right.

831
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:30,584
Legs down. Legs down.

832
01:25:30,692 --> 01:25:32,956
- Nice and calm.
- Matron.

833
01:25:33,061 --> 01:25:35,962
Yes. Close your eyes.
Ready, Doctor?

834
01:26:03,424 --> 01:26:05,392
Over the next eightyears...

835
01:26:05,493 --> 01:26:09,156
I received more than 200 applications
of electric shock treatment...

836
01:26:10,298 --> 01:26:13,062
each one equivalent in fear.
to an execution.

837
01:26:38,826 --> 01:26:41,260
Hurry up!

838
01:26:41,362 --> 01:26:44,490
- On the go.
- Come on. Hurry.

839
01:26:45,767 --> 01:26:48,497
Are you all right?

840
01:26:48,603 --> 01:26:50,468
I'm all right.

841
01:26:56,544 --> 01:26:59,513
- Hurry up.
- I don't want to go while they're watching.

842
01:27:03,918 --> 01:27:06,716
There's no one watching!

843
01:27:06,821 --> 01:27:08,789
Come on, go!

844
01:27:10,291 --> 01:27:12,953
- Miss Educated!
- Yeah.

845
01:27:27,508 --> 01:27:30,341
- There you are.

846
01:27:30,445 --> 01:27:32,913
Blue smoke

847
01:27:33,014 --> 01:27:35,710
Goes drifting by

848
01:27:35,817 --> 01:27:41,119
Into the deep blue sky

849
01:27:41,222 --> 01:27:44,487
When I think of home

850
01:27:44,592 --> 01:27:49,495
I sadly sigh

851
01:27:49,597 --> 01:27:54,159
Oh, I can see you there

852
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:59,605
With loving tears in your eyes

853
01:27:59,707 --> 01:28:03,507
As we fondly said

854
01:28:03,611 --> 01:28:07,240
Our last good-byes

855
01:28:08,816 --> 01:28:12,843
And as I sailed away

856
01:28:12,954 --> 01:28:16,185
With a longing to stay

857
01:28:16,291 --> 01:28:21,558
- I promised to be true

858
01:29:05,540 --> 01:29:08,168
- I've got your books.
- Good work,Janet.

859
01:29:08,276 --> 01:29:11,541
-Jolly good work.
- They've published them.

860
01:29:27,562 --> 01:29:31,760
- Where's my photograph?
- That's not the important thing.

861
01:29:33,000 --> 01:29:36,868
- Wh-Where's my photograph?
- The important thing is that you're an author.

862
01:29:39,507 --> 01:29:41,839
What do I do?

863
01:29:43,244 --> 01:29:45,508
You sign it here...

864
01:29:45,613 --> 01:29:48,081
on the inside front page.

865
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:52,549
- Is that what you do?
- Mmm.

866
01:30:01,529 --> 01:30:03,497
Good. Next one.

867
01:30:08,202 --> 01:30:10,602
They'll be worth a fortune
one day,Janet.

868
01:30:19,614 --> 01:30:21,514
Good.

869
01:30:22,750 --> 01:30:24,650
Sit down.

870
01:30:33,895 --> 01:30:36,557
We're putting you down
for that new operation.

871
01:30:40,968 --> 01:30:42,936
What new operation?

872
01:30:43,037 --> 01:30:45,904
You're going to have a leukotomy.

873
01:30:48,075 --> 01:30:50,475
There's no need to be frightened.

874
01:30:50,578 --> 01:30:52,808
It'll do you the world of good.

875
01:30:55,116 --> 01:30:57,084
Do I have to have one?

876
01:30:58,920 --> 01:31:02,117
It's not a question of"have to."
It's a question of what's best.

877
01:31:03,524 --> 01:31:06,459
Your mother has agreed.
She signed the papers.

878
01:31:30,418 --> 01:31:32,386
What do you think?

879
01:31:33,521 --> 01:31:36,547
Do you think they'll get out?

880
01:31:36,657 --> 01:31:40,559
I think once you're here,
you never get out.

881
01:32:09,624 --> 01:32:13,651
Fear... no... more...

882
01:32:14,729 --> 01:32:16,663
the heat...

883
01:32:16,764 --> 01:32:20,097
of the sun...

884
01:32:21,469 --> 01:32:26,338
nor the furious...

885
01:32:26,440 --> 01:32:29,170
winter's...

886
01:32:29,277 --> 01:32:31,677
rages.

887
01:32:31,779 --> 01:32:34,680
Now thy...

888
01:32:34,782 --> 01:32:39,048
worldly... task...

889
01:32:39,153 --> 01:32:41,519
is done.

890
01:32:51,432 --> 01:32:53,457
Oh. Hello.

891
01:32:53,568 --> 01:32:56,594
-Janet, isn't it?
- Dr. Palmer, what do you think?

892
01:32:56,704 --> 01:33:01,266
- About the prize?
- No. About the leukotomy.

893
01:33:01,375 --> 01:33:04,606
You've won the Hubert Church Award...

894
01:33:04,712 --> 01:33:07,579
for your book of short stories,
The Lagoon.

895
01:33:09,717 --> 01:33:14,086
Oh. I'm not going
to have the operation?

896
01:33:14,188 --> 01:33:16,088
No.

897
01:33:16,190 --> 01:33:18,658
I think you should stay in hospital
a little longer....

898
01:33:18,759 --> 01:33:22,126
until you're more confident
and stronger..

899
01:33:22,229 --> 01:33:25,130
And then we'll see
about getting you home.

900
01:34:11,112 --> 01:34:13,080
Seacliff Station, please.

901
01:35:02,263 --> 01:35:05,130
I don't want you
to leave home again ever.

902
01:35:07,835 --> 01:35:09,735
Okay, chief.

903
01:35:14,008 --> 01:35:18,308
- You're not going back to that nuthouse.
- With all those loonies?

904
01:35:19,447 --> 01:35:21,574
Aw, Dad.

905
01:35:21,682 --> 01:35:24,651
It's my private rest home
you're talking about.

906
01:35:31,058 --> 01:35:33,026
Why don't you eat with us?

907
01:35:39,100 --> 01:35:41,728
Why don't you live
in your own house?

908
01:35:43,104 --> 01:35:45,072
Have you got any children?

909
01:35:46,640 --> 01:35:49,268
Boys, come on.
Leave Auntie Janet alone, please.

910
01:35:49,376 --> 01:35:51,606
- Come have your tea.
- All right.

911
01:35:51,712 --> 01:35:53,612
Come on.

912
01:35:55,416 --> 01:35:58,180
Can you see something
out the window? Out.

913
01:35:58,285 --> 01:36:01,743
Frank Sargeson, the writer,
lives around here in an old bach.

914
01:36:03,023 --> 01:36:06,720
He came to visit me.
He heard I was your sister.

915
01:36:06,827 --> 01:36:09,887
- He asked if you'd like to go and see him.
- We could drop in now.

916
01:36:09,997 --> 01:36:13,899
No! I don't know him.

917
01:36:23,978 --> 01:36:25,946
He's not home.

918
01:36:27,515 --> 01:36:30,609
- Hello.
- You're Janet Frame?

919
01:36:30,718 --> 01:36:33,186
Come in. Come in.

920
01:36:34,488 --> 01:36:36,456
We'll come back later.

921
01:36:43,097 --> 01:36:45,895
Why don't you come and live here?

922
01:36:46,000 --> 01:36:49,458
There's a bed and desk
in the hut out back already set up.

923
01:36:50,871 --> 01:36:53,738
Well, you can't write
living in suburbia...

924
01:36:54,975 --> 01:36:58,172
amongst the nappies
and the bourgeois life.

925
01:36:59,547 --> 01:37:01,572
But I have to find a job.

926
01:37:01,682 --> 01:37:04,310
Why?

927
01:37:04,418 --> 01:37:06,386
You're a writer.

928
01:37:08,656 --> 01:37:10,749
They've refused me
the sickness benefit.

929
01:37:10,858 --> 01:37:12,883
Oh, have they?

930
01:37:12,993 --> 01:37:16,588
After all those years in hospital,
they can't do that.

931
01:37:18,966 --> 01:37:21,161
Look, I've got a good friend
who's a doctor.

932
01:37:21,268 --> 01:37:24,601
He'll fix you up with a benefit.
Of course he will.

933
01:37:26,040 --> 01:37:28,508
Would you like to come and look?

934
01:38:16,323 --> 01:38:18,257
"It was a sin...

935
01:38:18,359 --> 01:38:22,295
"to have watched Aunt Nettie
putting on her face...

936
01:38:22,396 --> 01:38:24,694
- "and it was worse -
- No, don't.

937
01:38:24,798 --> 01:38:26,925
- "it was worse for her, I suppose...
- Frank!

938
01:38:27,034 --> 01:38:30,470
"because now we knew
she had another face...

939
01:38:30,571 --> 01:38:32,801
- "and had another smile to it.
- Frank!

940
01:38:32,907 --> 01:38:35,774
"We'd found her out like a thief.

941
01:38:35,876 --> 01:38:38,344
She kept blushing."

942
01:38:41,949 --> 01:38:44,417
Not bad.

943
01:38:44,518 --> 01:38:47,715
Bit... Dylan Thomas-ish.

944
01:38:51,892 --> 01:38:55,020
Don't worry I fit comes back.
It's only your first try.

945
01:38:56,297 --> 01:38:58,197
Just remember, Waldo...

946
01:38:58,299 --> 01:39:00,631
there's always another publisher.

947
01:39:06,440 --> 01:39:10,035
- Aha!Maiden bearing gramophone.
- All right.

948
01:39:14,815 --> 01:39:16,783
I brought these records.

949
01:39:20,321 --> 01:39:22,516
- Are you pouring, Frank?

950
01:39:22,623 --> 01:39:25,490
"We had fed the heart on fantasies.

951
01:39:25,592 --> 01:39:28,288
"The heart's grown brutal
from the fare.

952
01:39:28,395 --> 01:39:32,126
"More substance in our enmities
than in our love.

953
01:39:32,232 --> 01:39:36,464
"Oh, honey bees, come build
in the empty house...

954
01:39:36,570 --> 01:39:38,470
of a stare."

955
01:39:38,572 --> 01:39:41,040
That's wonderful.

956
01:39:43,410 --> 01:39:45,878
I've only read his earlier works.

957
01:39:45,980 --> 01:39:49,541
"Tread softly because
you tread on my dreams"?

958
01:39:49,650 --> 01:39:52,312
"I went out to the hazel wood
because a fire was in my head."

959
01:39:52,419 --> 01:39:54,683
- "Till the moon has taken flight.
- KarI!

960
01:39:54,788 --> 01:39:57,120
- "To and fro we leap...
- Shh.

961
01:39:57,224 --> 01:39:59,351
- "and chase the frothy bubbles.
- You're shouting.

962
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:01,860
"While the world is full of troubles...

963
01:40:01,962 --> 01:40:04,089
- "come away, oh, human child...
- Shh.

964
01:40:04,198 --> 01:40:06,291
"to the waters and the wild...

965
01:40:06,400 --> 01:40:09,995
"with a fairy hand in hand.

966
01:40:10,104 --> 01:40:12,402
- "Cause the world's more full of weeping...
- Shh.

967
01:40:12,506 --> 01:40:15,737
than you can understand. "

968
01:40:45,472 --> 01:40:48,202
Frank!

969
01:40:49,943 --> 01:40:51,843
Frank!

970
01:40:53,180 --> 01:40:55,148
- Frank?

971
01:41:08,028 --> 01:41:10,622
First up.

972
01:41:10,731 --> 01:41:13,529
I can't believe it.

973
01:41:14,635 --> 01:41:17,103
Well, not everyone's
that lucky, Waldo...

974
01:41:17,204 --> 01:41:19,468
not on their first try.

975
01:41:19,573 --> 01:41:22,041
Something must have clicked
with them.

976
01:41:24,044 --> 01:41:27,502
- Well, congratulations.

977
01:41:28,749 --> 01:41:32,310
- It's amazing.

978
01:41:41,562 --> 01:41:45,464
- To Frank,
the next step was obvious.

979
01:41:45,566 --> 01:41:47,966
I needed to broaden my experience.

980
01:41:48,068 --> 01:41:52,471
He organized my application
for a literary grant to travel overseas.

981
01:41:52,573 --> 01:41:57,442
I knew that if I stayed, there would be
no second chance for my survival.

982
01:42:07,221 --> 01:42:10,520
So, you're off
to the old country, eh?

983
01:42:11,558 --> 01:42:13,924
Good on you, girl.
Good on you.

984
01:42:21,969 --> 01:42:23,869
Mr. Frame.

985
01:42:26,006 --> 01:42:28,031
This is Frank Sargeson.

986
01:42:28,142 --> 01:42:30,042
My father.

987
01:42:32,279 --> 01:42:35,806
Oh, you've got a very clever
daughter there, Mr. Frame.

988
01:42:38,085 --> 01:42:39,985
Thank you.

989
01:42:47,461 --> 01:42:49,759
Bye-bye.

990
01:42:49,863 --> 01:42:51,797
Bon voyage.

991
01:43:51,258 --> 01:43:54,625
Time and chance are but a tide

992
01:43:54,728 --> 01:43:57,754
Ha ha, the wooing o'it

993
01:43:57,864 --> 01:44:00,924
Slighted love is sair to bide

994
01:44:01,034 --> 01:44:04,026
Ha ha, the wooing o'it

995
01:44:04,137 --> 01:44:06,935
"Shall I like a fool," quoth he

996
01:44:07,040 --> 01:44:10,134
For a haughty hizzie die

997
01:44:10,244 --> 01:44:13,475
She may go to France for me

998
01:44:13,580 --> 01:44:17,016
Ha ha, the wooing o'it

999
01:44:25,559 --> 01:44:29,723
- What happened to you two?

1000
01:44:29,830 --> 01:44:32,390
Ah, we've just been, uh,
looking around.

1001
01:44:32,499 --> 01:44:34,865
What have you been up to?

1002
01:44:38,872 --> 01:44:41,864
- Isn't it absolutely gorgeous?

1003
01:44:44,311 --> 01:44:46,779
Can I help you?

1004
01:44:46,880 --> 01:44:49,348
Oh, no, thank you.

1005
01:44:54,187 --> 01:44:57,315
Was that the one
in the white tuxedo?

1006
01:44:57,424 --> 01:44:59,483
Oh, I love it.
What's his name?

1007
01:44:59,593 --> 01:45:01,561
We should go then.

1008
01:45:44,938 --> 01:45:46,906
Hello. I'm Janet Frame.

1009
01:45:47,007 --> 01:45:50,272
I wrote and reserved a room.

1010
01:45:50,377 --> 01:45:52,277
Frame.

1011
01:45:59,386 --> 01:46:01,786
No, I have no "Frame."

1012
01:46:07,461 --> 01:46:10,919
- But I wrote.
- No, we've had no letter from you.

1013
01:46:15,902 --> 01:46:20,635
- But I'm all the way from New Zealand.
- We have guests staying here from all over the world.

1014
01:46:22,743 --> 01:46:25,473
Have you no friends in London?

1015
01:46:25,579 --> 01:46:28,070
None.

1016
01:46:29,683 --> 01:46:32,345
Why don't you try the Y.W.C.A.?.

1017
01:47:03,083 --> 01:47:06,280
Well, I hope you won't
be here for the winter.

1018
01:47:07,587 --> 01:47:10,215
We had a woman die of pneumonia
in one of these rooms.

1019
01:47:10,323 --> 01:47:12,757
That one.

1020
01:47:12,859 --> 01:47:15,760
We had a crown prince of Europe
in this one last year.

1021
01:47:21,368 --> 01:47:23,859
There.

1022
01:47:23,970 --> 01:47:26,336
You can call me Patrick.

1023
01:47:29,810 --> 01:47:32,278
So, what you doin' in London, Janet?

1024
01:47:32,379 --> 01:47:35,177
Oh, I'm here on a literary grant.

1025
01:47:35,282 --> 01:47:37,250
A literary grant?

1026
01:47:39,486 --> 01:47:42,751
But I'm not going to stay in London
for very long.

1027
01:47:42,856 --> 01:47:44,824
I'm going to go to Spain.

1028
01:47:47,260 --> 01:47:49,353
It's cheaper there.

1029
01:47:49,463 --> 01:47:53,490
- You're not going on your own?
- Yes.

1030
01:47:53,600 --> 01:47:56,933
Well, you'll be in danger
in a foreign place like that, Janet.

1031
01:47:57,037 --> 01:47:59,335
I'll look after you
while you're in London...

1032
01:47:59,439 --> 01:48:01,873
but you mustn't go to the continent
on your own.

1033
01:48:04,511 --> 01:48:06,979
By the way, are you fancy-free?

1034
01:48:11,551 --> 01:48:13,519
Yes, I'm fancy-free.

1035
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:17,852
Then watch out for the blacks.
They're everywhere in London.

1036
01:48:17,958 --> 01:48:22,258
I don't think that someone should be
referred to by the color of their skin.

1037
01:48:22,362 --> 01:48:24,353
You wait and see.

1038
01:48:26,733 --> 01:48:29,429
Oh. Well.

1039
01:48:29,536 --> 01:48:31,436
Come on.

1040
01:48:32,973 --> 01:48:34,873
Thank you.

1041
01:48:38,612 --> 01:48:41,012
Here we are. Smells good.
Here you go.

1042
01:48:41,114 --> 01:48:44,880
- Now, this is paella, Janet.
- Oh, yes, the Spanish dish.

1043
01:48:44,985 --> 01:48:47,283
I learnt to make it
when I was living there.

1044
01:48:47,387 --> 01:48:51,289
- What were you doing in Spain?
- Oh, I'm an artist, so I lived up there
for a while and worked.

1045
01:48:51,391 --> 01:48:53,291
- Katie?
- Yes?

1046
01:48:53,393 --> 01:48:56,954
Why don't you write to Colin
and tell him Janet's going to Ibiza?

1047
01:48:57,063 --> 01:49:00,157
Yeah, well, definitely.
Colin's a really nice guy.

1048
01:49:00,267 --> 01:49:03,725
In fact, he'll show you around.
In fact, he's gorgeous.

1049
01:49:03,837 --> 01:49:06,704
So, uh, what do you write, Janet?

1050
01:49:06,806 --> 01:49:09,604
- Oh, um, poetry and fiction.
- Mm-hmm.

1051
01:49:09,709 --> 01:49:12,177
Some short stories,
and I've written a novel.

1052
01:49:12,279 --> 01:49:14,270
- Have you had anything published?
- Yes.

1053
01:49:14,381 --> 01:49:18,750
- For which magazine?
- Um, no. The short stories are in a book.

1054
01:49:18,852 --> 01:49:21,616
- A book?
- The novel's been published.

1055
01:49:21,721 --> 01:49:25,851
- You mean you've published a book?
- Well done, Janet. Excellent!

1056
01:49:25,959 --> 01:49:29,087
In fact, I've never met anybody
who's published a book before.

1057
01:49:29,195 --> 01:49:31,857
Well, I mean, somebody like us.
That's great.

1058
01:49:31,965 --> 01:49:34,593
Well, it's only in New Zealand.

1059
01:49:34,701 --> 01:49:36,669
- Still, it's a book, Janet.
- Who's your publisher?

1060
01:49:36,770 --> 01:49:39,637
Caxton Press for the short stories...

1061
01:49:39,739 --> 01:49:42,037
and Pegasus for the novel.

1062
01:49:43,777 --> 01:49:45,711
Well, I've chosen my publisher.

1063
01:49:45,812 --> 01:49:48,406
Yes, we know, Paul. Faber.

1064
01:49:48,515 --> 01:49:51,541
- Faber & Faber.
- To Faber & Faber.

1065
01:50:03,597 --> 01:50:06,225
You didn't come home last night,Janet.

1066
01:50:06,333 --> 01:50:09,302
No, I missed the bus.
It was too late.

1067
01:50:10,837 --> 01:50:13,431
Come in. Come in.

1068
01:50:19,479 --> 01:50:21,538
Where'd you stay?

1069
01:50:21,648 --> 01:50:23,775
With some new friends.

1070
01:50:25,385 --> 01:50:28,013
Who are these new friends?

1071
01:50:28,121 --> 01:50:32,387
Writers and painters. Artists.

1072
01:50:32,492 --> 01:50:35,620
That's not the type for you,Janet.

1073
01:50:35,729 --> 01:50:38,630
They hang around and do no work.

1074
01:50:38,732 --> 01:50:40,757
And what about their morals?

1075
01:50:40,867 --> 01:50:44,325
All that... muckin' in together.

1076
01:50:45,438 --> 01:50:47,429
I'm a writer too, Patrick.

1077
01:50:48,775 --> 01:50:50,800
For the moment, maybe...

1078
01:50:50,910 --> 01:50:53,879
but then when you come back
from Spain, we'll get you a real job.

1079
01:50:53,980 --> 01:50:56,278
We'll look to our future then.

1080
01:51:07,694 --> 01:51:09,662
This is for you.

1081
01:52:06,419 --> 01:52:08,717
You can go to France with me.

1082
01:52:12,492 --> 01:52:15,825
Ha ha, the wooing o'it

1083
01:52:44,557 --> 01:52:47,890
My bags. My baggage.
It's not here.

1084
01:52:54,567 --> 01:52:56,626
No, they're not here.

1085
01:53:07,480 --> 01:53:09,948
Your bags are in Paris.
In Paris.

1086
01:53:10,049 --> 01:53:14,383
The ticket for leaving bags is in Paris,
not for coming to Spain.

1087
01:53:14,487 --> 01:53:17,081
You understand me?
Your bags are in Paris.

1088
01:53:47,120 --> 01:53:49,020
Colin?

1089
01:53:49,122 --> 01:53:52,319
Oh. Katie described your hair.

1090
01:53:52,425 --> 01:53:55,394
- Where's your luggage?
- I'm traveling light.

1091
01:53:55,495 --> 01:53:57,793
Oh, that's easy then. Come on.

1092
01:54:18,284 --> 01:54:20,912
- Okay then. It's fixed up.
- Thank you.

1093
01:54:21,020 --> 01:54:25,480
There's a room free. You said you wanted
to stay a couple of nights, yeah?

1094
01:54:25,592 --> 01:54:28,390
Well, that's fine.
Okay. See you around.

1095
01:54:31,965 --> 01:54:33,990
Thank you.

1096
01:55:37,664 --> 01:55:41,600
"Thou who didst waken
from his summer dreams...

1097
01:55:41,701 --> 01:55:45,262
"the blue Mediterranean
where he lay...

1098
01:55:45,371 --> 01:55:47,601
"and saw in sleep...

1099
01:55:47,707 --> 01:55:51,234
"old palaces and towers...

1100
01:55:51,344 --> 01:55:55,144
quivering within the wave's
intenser day."

1101
01:56:38,024 --> 01:56:40,652
One day soon I would
walk around the harbor road...

1102
01:56:40,760 --> 01:56:44,161
to the opposite shore,
where the real city lay...

1103
01:56:44,263 --> 01:56:46,891
that I knew only
as the city in the sea.

1104
01:57:09,389 --> 01:57:11,983
- Hello again.
- Musicians and motorbikes.

1105
01:57:12,091 --> 01:57:14,059
Interesting combo.

1106
01:57:17,130 --> 01:57:20,588
What was she like anyway?
Be a bit more careful, that's all.

1107
01:57:24,070 --> 01:57:26,095
- Hello.
- Sarah.

1108
01:57:26,205 --> 01:57:28,105
Hello.

1109
01:57:30,076 --> 01:57:33,534
My luggage is coming.
They sent it by sea instead of rail.

1110
01:57:40,853 --> 01:57:43,822
And, um, I found a place to stay.

1111
01:57:45,324 --> 01:57:47,224
Good.

1112
01:57:47,326 --> 01:57:51,285
Well, it has a view
of the water and the town.

1113
01:57:52,331 --> 01:57:55,300
No, I mean the town and the water.

1114
01:58:00,440 --> 01:58:03,068
Well, bye-bye.

1115
01:58:03,176 --> 01:58:05,076
Oh! Hold on.

1116
01:58:07,346 --> 01:58:11,373
That's the woman. Remember,
the one I met from the ferry the other day?

1117
01:58:11,484 --> 01:58:14,544
- Without any luggage.
- Katie's friend or something.

1118
01:58:14,654 --> 01:58:17,589
It's remarkable. I didn't think
there were people like that.

1119
01:58:17,690 --> 01:58:20,250
She's very, very nervous.
Very nervous.

1120
01:58:20,359 --> 01:58:22,520
How did Sarah look?

1121
01:58:36,275 --> 01:58:38,937
Oh.

1122
01:58:41,614 --> 01:58:43,582
Uh, carne. Carne.

1123
01:58:44,717 --> 01:58:47,242
Uh -

1124
01:58:47,353 --> 01:58:49,480
- Sн. Sн.

1125
01:58:49,589 --> 01:58:51,489
Mmm.

1126
01:58:55,328 --> 01:58:58,422
No, no.

1127
01:58:58,531 --> 01:59:01,295
- No hombre.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1128
01:59:06,839 --> 01:59:09,831
Oh! Yeah, my sister made me -
mi hermana.

1129
01:59:09,942 --> 01:59:12,843
Made it from a curtain.
Uh, cortina.

1130
01:59:19,252 --> 01:59:22,346
I was approved of because I was not a tourist.

1131
01:59:22,455 --> 01:59:24,514
I was not American.

1132
01:59:24,624 --> 01:59:27,252
I was an industrious escritora...

1133
01:59:27,360 --> 01:59:29,828
who did not have foreign friends.

1134
01:59:43,476 --> 01:59:45,376
A tree.

1135
02:01:09,128 --> 02:01:13,258
I felt sick with disappointment
and a sense ofbetrayal...

1136
02:01:13,366 --> 02:01:16,392
for I believed I had rented
the entire house.

1137
02:01:16,502 --> 02:01:20,563
I had looked on Number 6
Ignacio Riquere as my place...

1138
02:01:20,673 --> 02:01:23,642
not to be shared with a foreigner.
who spoke English.

1139
02:01:25,011 --> 02:01:27,479
Where do you get your money changed, Janet?

1140
02:01:27,580 --> 02:01:30,208
Oh, I changed it here when I arrived...

1141
02:01:30,316 --> 02:01:32,284
at the bank.

1142
02:01:32,385 --> 02:01:35,752
All of it?
You shouldn't have done that.

1143
02:01:35,855 --> 02:01:39,256
I get my American scholarship money
changed in Andorra.

1144
02:01:39,358 --> 02:01:41,883
There's where the cheap
money market is.

1145
02:01:41,994 --> 02:01:44,360
"Cheap money"?

1146
02:01:59,779 --> 02:02:01,747
A woman devil?

1147
02:02:03,249 --> 02:02:05,581
She sleeps in his bed.

1148
02:02:09,755 --> 02:02:12,519
Thank God you not like her.

1149
02:02:27,473 --> 02:02:30,670
I longed to be
as full of secrets as she seemed to be...

1150
02:02:30,776 --> 02:02:33,244
that would prompt a man
to discover them.

1151
02:02:34,847 --> 02:02:38,214
But for so long, I had blocked
all exits and entrances...

1152
02:02:38,317 --> 02:02:41,343
that I felt I was as sexless
as a block of wood.

1153
02:02:43,889 --> 02:02:47,825
- Hi,Janet. These are my friends.

1154
02:02:47,927 --> 02:02:49,827
Dora and Bernard.

1155
02:02:49,929 --> 02:02:51,829
- Hello, Dora.
- Hi, Janet.

1156
02:02:51,931 --> 02:02:54,900
- Hello, Bernard.
- It's Bernard's birthday.

1157
02:02:55,000 --> 02:02:58,697
- Would you like to join us for a glass of wine?
- Oh, no, thank you, Edwin. I was just going.

1158
02:02:58,804 --> 02:03:01,796
- Hey, I 'd like you to.
- Dora studies flute in Paris.

1159
02:03:01,907 --> 02:03:06,105
- You been to Paris, Janet?
- Oh, just one night, really, on my way here.

1160
02:03:06,212 --> 02:03:08,237
Oh, you need more
than a day in Paris.

1161
02:03:08,347 --> 02:03:11,077
- Hey. W.B.
- To Bernard.

1162
02:03:11,183 --> 02:03:14,311
- Thirty-fourth year to heaven.
- I don't think heaven's got much to do with it.

1163
02:03:14,420 --> 02:03:16,718
What do you know about heaven, Edwin?
Huh? Huh?

1164
02:03:16,822 --> 02:03:19,450
- Cincinnati last year, big guy.
- Don't talk Cincinnati.

1165
02:03:19,558 --> 02:03:21,685
Oh,yeah?

1166
02:03:25,131 --> 02:03:27,599
Hey, are you gonna show me your work?

1167
02:03:27,700 --> 02:03:30,032
Oh,yeah, I've been working.

1168
02:03:56,462 --> 02:03:58,362
-Janet.
- Oh!

1169
02:03:58,464 --> 02:04:00,989
Hi. Good morning.

1170
02:04:01,100 --> 02:04:04,092
- Hello.
- How are you?

1171
02:04:04,203 --> 02:04:06,671
Good.

1172
02:04:11,143 --> 02:04:13,077
Uh-huh!

1173
02:04:15,114 --> 02:04:17,844
Byron.

1174
02:04:17,950 --> 02:04:20,748
So, uh,you wanna go walking?

1175
02:04:24,957 --> 02:04:28,324
I'll tell you one thing.
I could not work this morning.

1176
02:04:31,464 --> 02:04:33,898
Um, what sort of work do you do?

1177
02:04:33,999 --> 02:04:37,025
Well, back home I work
as a history professor...

1178
02:04:37,136 --> 02:04:39,661
but I'm really a poet.

1179
02:04:39,772 --> 02:04:41,672
A poet.

1180
02:04:43,576 --> 02:04:47,012
Hey, come on. Edwin tells me
you're a published author.

1181
02:04:48,147 --> 02:04:52,208
- But, ah, what about Auden?
- Oh, yes.

1182
02:04:52,318 --> 02:04:55,412
"Follow, poet, follow right
to the bottom of the night."

1183
02:04:55,521 --> 02:04:57,989
- Yeah. Right.
- "With your unconstraining voice...

1184
02:04:58,090 --> 02:05:00,058
still persuade us to rejoice."

1185
02:05:00,159 --> 02:05:02,491
Oh, and -
The Kipling.

1186
02:05:02,595 --> 02:05:04,859
Kipling.
Do you know "Gunga Din"?

1187
02:05:06,198 --> 02:05:08,189
What about Yeats?

1188
02:05:08,300 --> 02:05:11,497
Yeah. But how does "Gunga Din" start?

1189
02:05:11,604 --> 02:05:14,198
Now, I know that one. Uh -

1190
02:05:40,566 --> 02:05:43,433
- I have to go.
- Yeah, I know.

1191
02:05:43,536 --> 02:05:45,436
I know.

1192
02:06:21,040 --> 02:06:23,008
Well, good morning.

1193
02:06:25,177 --> 02:06:27,645
I brought some breakfast.

1194
02:07:06,552 --> 02:07:08,520
Mmm. Uh -

1195
02:07:09,622 --> 02:07:13,524
Just let me read you this first, okay?
Uh, I wrote it this morning.

1196
02:07:13,626 --> 02:07:17,426
You know that time just after waking?
It's when I'm at my most creative.

1197
02:07:18,464 --> 02:07:20,659
Now, it's just a first draft.

1198
02:07:22,901 --> 02:07:27,338
"Spring."
"Spring in all its lightness.

1199
02:07:27,439 --> 02:07:31,170
Glad brightness
of blue-domed day."

1200
02:07:31,276 --> 02:07:33,744
I had "blue-roofed,"
but I changed it.

1201
02:07:35,247 --> 02:07:37,147
"Blue-domed day.

1202
02:07:37,249 --> 02:07:39,444
"Heart-holding hills of Ohio...

1203
02:07:39,551 --> 02:07:43,317
"where memory stretches
like miles and s -

1204
02:07:43,422 --> 02:07:46,880
spring renews its promise
like the first-spoken word."

1205
02:07:48,227 --> 02:07:50,787
- Do you like it?
- Hmm.

1206
02:07:52,698 --> 02:07:54,632
It must be lovely.

1207
02:07:54,733 --> 02:07:56,701
Spring in Ohio.

1208
02:08:04,543 --> 02:08:07,171
Blue-do -
Did you like blue-domed?

1209
02:08:12,885 --> 02:08:16,946
-  Oh, beautiful!

1210
02:08:17,056 --> 02:08:19,524
Do it again.

1211
02:08:50,255 --> 02:08:53,816
Is the American rich?

1212
02:08:53,926 --> 02:08:57,589
I don't know. Maybe.

1213
02:09:08,474 --> 02:09:11,910
Bernard, I want to show you something
that Dora can do.

1214
02:09:12,010 --> 02:09:14,638
She can kiss and play the stick game
at the same time.

1215
02:09:14,747 --> 02:09:18,080
- Watch this.
- All right, all right.

1216
02:09:18,183 --> 02:09:20,310
You think that is something?
You think that is something?

1217
02:09:20,419 --> 02:09:22,387
- That's something.
- I want you to see something.

1218
02:09:22,488 --> 02:09:25,355
My girl, who can play the Maori
stick game from New Zealand...

1219
02:09:25,457 --> 02:09:28,756
can also drink wine and kiss
at the same time.

1220
02:09:28,861 --> 02:09:33,059
- She can chug at the same time?
- Chug-a-lug.

1221
02:09:33,165 --> 02:09:35,429
Chug, chug, chug.

1222
02:09:35,534 --> 02:09:37,434
Look at that.
Now, that is the sort -

1223
02:09:37,536 --> 02:09:39,504
You're always showing off, Bernard.
I'm sick of it.

1224
02:09:39,605 --> 02:09:42,631
I'm always showing off?
Come on! En garde!

1225
02:09:44,710 --> 02:09:46,678
- You always go too far!

1226
02:09:46,779 --> 02:09:48,679
Someone get this guy off me.

1227
02:10:08,333 --> 02:10:11,666
I haven't heard your typewriter for weeks.
You're not writing, are you?

1228
02:10:14,106 --> 02:10:16,006
I'm taking a break.

1229
02:10:17,476 --> 02:10:19,944
I hope you know what you're doing.

1230
02:10:23,015 --> 02:10:25,142
- Of course I do.
- Okay.

1231
02:11:17,069 --> 02:11:19,333
Well, I guess this is my last week.

1232
02:11:24,209 --> 02:11:26,677
Oh, come on.
You knew I was going.

1233
02:11:27,713 --> 02:11:29,772
No.

1234
02:11:29,882 --> 02:11:33,579
Well, I have to get back,
prepare for next term and so on.

1235
02:11:33,685 --> 02:11:36,677
God knows, I don't want to go.

1236
02:11:36,788 --> 02:11:38,756
I didn't realize it was next week.

1237
02:11:38,857 --> 02:11:43,294
Hey, listen. Look. No, no, no.
Listen to me.

1238
02:11:45,264 --> 02:11:47,459
I've had a great summer.

1239
02:11:48,901 --> 02:11:50,869
I really mean that.

1240
02:11:52,404 --> 02:11:54,372
I'm gonna miss you.

1241
02:11:56,375 --> 02:11:58,605
Huh?

1242
02:11:58,710 --> 02:12:00,610
Hmm?

1243
02:12:27,272 --> 02:12:30,730
Francesca.
Senorita Janetta - is she home?

1244
02:12:37,549 --> 02:12:39,744
Look, I love you too.

1245
02:12:46,391 --> 02:12:48,621
- Janet?

1246
02:12:54,132 --> 02:12:56,760
-Janet? Are you there?

1247
02:13:02,908 --> 02:13:05,240
Uh, the ferry goes at midday.

1248
02:13:09,815 --> 02:13:11,715
Janet?

1249
02:13:19,958 --> 02:13:22,426
I'd really like to say good-bye.

1250
02:13:58,830 --> 02:14:01,230
Janetta?

1251
02:14:08,907 --> 02:14:11,535
These Americans,
they spoil everything.

1252
02:14:11,643 --> 02:14:17,343
Even the light they make dark.

1253
02:14:53,685 --> 02:14:55,653
True romance, indeed.

1254
02:14:55,754 --> 02:14:57,984
So much for poetry and music.

1255
02:14:58,090 --> 02:15:01,218
I was beginning to suspect
that I might be pregnant.

1256
02:15:03,562 --> 02:15:06,360
Here.

1257
02:15:06,465 --> 02:15:09,491
Here. What you got in here?

1258
02:15:12,170 --> 02:15:15,298
I managed to get you a room
in the main house...

1259
02:15:15,407 --> 02:15:17,739
next to mine.

1260
02:15:17,843 --> 02:15:20,311
Oh, we've got a new landlady.

1261
02:15:20,412 --> 02:15:23,176
She's a real character.
Tip-top.

1262
02:15:23,281 --> 02:15:25,249
She likes to be called Ma.

1263
02:15:27,319 --> 02:15:29,378
By the way...

1264
02:15:29,488 --> 02:15:31,956
I trust you're still fancy-free.

1265
02:15:35,627 --> 02:15:37,822
Great. Come on then!

1266
02:15:37,929 --> 02:15:40,022
I've got some tea on.

1267
02:15:40,132 --> 02:15:43,101
It's the bus!
Janet! Where are you?

1268
02:15:52,244 --> 02:15:54,838
You don't want to spend
your time writing.

1269
02:15:56,915 --> 02:15:58,883
There's no money in it.

1270
02:16:02,654 --> 02:16:05,054
It's all right for a holiday...

1271
02:16:05,157 --> 02:16:07,717
but nothin' else.

1272
02:16:07,826 --> 02:16:09,794
Not for permanent.

1273
02:16:16,301 --> 02:16:18,792
What about Peek Freans?

1274
02:16:20,739 --> 02:16:23,299
- Peek Freans?
- Yeah!

1275
02:16:23,408 --> 02:16:26,206
You could work in the office there.

1276
02:16:27,412 --> 02:16:29,312
Yeah!

1277
02:17:17,662 --> 02:17:20,290
Although I had not wanted the baby...

1278
02:17:20,398 --> 02:17:23,959
I had sometimes imagined
a boy with Bernard's laugh...

1279
02:17:24,069 --> 02:17:26,435
or a girl with his eyes.

1280
02:17:29,608 --> 02:17:32,907
So nice to have a mature applicant.

1281
02:17:33,011 --> 02:17:35,479
We have so many young ones.

1282
02:17:38,650 --> 02:17:40,675
Any major illnesses?

1283
02:17:40,785 --> 02:17:42,685
No.

1284
02:17:42,787 --> 02:17:46,587
- Uh, any operations?
- No.

1285
02:17:46,691 --> 02:17:49,455
- Psychiatric treatment?
- Yes.

1286
02:17:51,129 --> 02:17:53,996
I spent some time in hospital
in New Zealand.

1287
02:17:54,099 --> 02:17:56,431
How long is "some time"?

1288
02:17:58,403 --> 02:18:00,303
Eight years.

1289
02:18:00,405 --> 02:18:03,533
How could you possibly think
of being a nurse?

1290
02:18:06,478 --> 02:18:08,446
What was the diagnosis?

1291
02:18:13,885 --> 02:18:16,752
- Schizophrenia.
- I'm sorry.

1292
02:18:16,855 --> 02:18:19,483
No.

1293
02:18:19,591 --> 02:18:22,321
It's out of the question.

1294
02:19:01,666 --> 02:19:04,294
I felt as if all the griefs I had ever known...

1295
02:19:04,402 --> 02:19:07,303
were beginning to surface within me.

1296
02:19:15,980 --> 02:19:18,574
In fear and despair for my life...

1297
02:19:18,683 --> 02:19:23,643
I needed answers to the questions
I still asked myself about my history.

1298
02:19:23,755 --> 02:19:28,215
I knew that talk ofsuicide
must always be taken seriously.

1299
02:19:28,326 --> 02:19:32,592
Such talk came readily to me
as a shortcut to ensure action.

1300
02:19:38,203 --> 02:19:40,831
I was admitted
as a voluntary patient.

1301
02:20:23,248 --> 02:20:27,207
Finally it was concluded that I had
never suffered from schizophrenia.

1302
02:20:28,253 --> 02:20:31,279
At first the tr.uth seemed
mor.e ter.r.ifying than the lie.

1303
02:20:32,657 --> 02:20:36,286
How could I now ask for help
when there was nothing wrong with me?

1304
02:20:39,230 --> 02:20:41,596
You know the problems
you've been experiencing...

1305
02:20:41,699 --> 02:20:44,691
are a direct result
of all those years in hospital.

1306
02:20:44,803 --> 02:20:47,271
You can't undo that quickly.

1307
02:20:47,372 --> 02:20:49,772
I'm here whenever you need me...

1308
02:20:49,874 --> 02:20:54,038
but, I think for a start,
once a week.

1309
02:20:54,145 --> 02:20:56,045
Once a week. All right.

1310
02:20:56,147 --> 02:21:01,346
Mmm. And I want you to write about
your time spent in hospital in New Zealand.

1311
02:21:01,453 --> 02:21:05,719
It'll help give you
a clearer view to the future.

1312
02:21:05,824 --> 02:21:08,987
- But I have to find a job.
- Don't have to worry about that.

1313
02:21:09,093 --> 02:21:11,618
You'll get National Assistance.

1314
02:21:11,729 --> 02:21:14,857
If anyone tells you to get out and mix...

1315
02:21:14,966 --> 02:21:17,298
and you don't want to...

1316
02:21:17,402 --> 02:21:19,302
don't.

1317
02:22:37,248 --> 02:22:40,615
- Have you read it?
- Yes, I have.

1318
02:22:40,718 --> 02:22:44,381
And I'm sure that getting that time
out of your system will be good for you.

1319
02:22:46,424 --> 02:22:49,985
But as a book, do you like it?

1320
02:22:50,094 --> 02:22:53,063
I told you, I 'm not a literary chap.

1321
02:22:54,265 --> 02:22:56,495
Have you thought of getting an agent?

1322
02:22:56,601 --> 02:22:59,092
- I already have one.
- What did he say?

1323
02:22:59,203 --> 02:23:03,003
- I wanted you to read it first.
- That's good.

1324
02:23:04,275 --> 02:23:07,733
Now I have, take it to him,
get his opinion.

1325
02:23:58,529 --> 02:24:01,327
I'm going to meet
my publisher tomorrow.

1326
02:24:01,432 --> 02:24:05,232
Ooh! Why don't I make
a hair appointment for you?

1327
02:24:05,336 --> 02:24:08,703
Oh, no. Nothing works. I've tried.

1328
02:24:12,844 --> 02:24:15,312
I'm sure they could
do something with it.

1329
02:24:30,628 --> 02:24:33,859
Granted, your books
have had good reviews.

1330
02:24:33,965 --> 02:24:35,990
Some very good.

1331
02:24:36,100 --> 02:24:39,729
But what I want you to do now
is write a best seller.

1332
02:24:42,106 --> 02:24:46,202
When Wanda Lyons comes to see me,
do you know how she comes?

1333
02:24:46,310 --> 02:24:48,778
She comes in a Rolls-Royce.

1334
02:24:48,880 --> 02:24:51,508
You are a better writer
than Wanda.

1335
02:24:53,751 --> 02:24:55,651
Best seller.

1336
02:24:55,753 --> 02:24:57,721
Best seller.

1337
02:24:57,822 --> 02:25:00,290
Study them.
They'll give you the form.

1338
02:25:01,793 --> 02:25:04,261
- Where is it you're living?
- Camberwell.

1339
02:25:04,362 --> 02:25:07,388
Camberwell is a wasteland.

1340
02:25:07,498 --> 02:25:11,093
I'll make you an offer.
I'll give you an apartment.

1341
02:25:11,202 --> 02:25:13,796
Give me?

1342
02:25:13,905 --> 02:25:16,635
Yes, I'd like you to write
your next book in there.

1343
02:25:19,977 --> 02:25:23,913
Uh - I don't know.
I'll have to see.

1344
02:25:24,015 --> 02:25:28,111
Also, I've got some people
who'd like to meet you.

1345
02:25:29,954 --> 02:25:31,854
And don't forget.

1346
02:25:31,956 --> 02:25:34,652
Next time you come
in a Rolls-Royce.

1347
02:26:05,156 --> 02:26:08,284
There. These should fit you as well.

1348
02:26:08,392 --> 02:26:11,190
Lovely. Now, I'll send Columba
for your wet things.

1349
02:26:11,295 --> 02:26:15,061
Oh, I loved your last book.
It was just absolutely marvelous.

1350
02:26:15,166 --> 02:26:17,464
- Take your time.
- Thank you.

1351
02:26:36,921 --> 02:26:39,389
- You enjoyed the book then?
- Oh,yes.

1352
02:26:39,490 --> 02:26:42,323
She's an interesting new author..

1353
02:26:42,426 --> 02:26:45,486
Probably won't sell.
It probably won't be a best seller..

1354
02:26:45,596 --> 02:26:47,928
We won't lose anything on it.

1355
02:26:48,032 --> 02:26:50,899
Janet Frame,
Alan and Ruth Sillitoe.

1356
02:26:51,002 --> 02:26:53,027
- Pleased to meet you at last.
- I 'll get you a drink.

1357
02:26:53,137 --> 02:26:55,105
- Hello.
-Janet, welcome.

1358
02:26:55,206 --> 02:26:58,175
Janet, do make yourself comfortable.
Sit down, please.

1359
02:27:01,179 --> 02:27:03,443
I loved your Faces in the Water..

1360
02:27:03,548 --> 02:27:05,948
It's powerful stuff.
Very true.

1361
02:27:08,085 --> 02:27:09,985
Thank you.

1362
02:27:11,889 --> 02:27:15,188
I, um - I enjoyed your book too.

1363
02:27:15,293 --> 02:27:17,386
The Loneliness
of the Long-Distance Runner..

1364
02:27:19,197 --> 02:27:21,097
I 'm glad.

1365
02:27:23,234 --> 02:27:25,259
Here you are,Janet.

1366
02:27:25,369 --> 02:27:27,269
Thank you.

1367
02:27:31,876 --> 02:27:36,472
Janet's in our Knightsbridge
apartment at the moment...

1368
02:27:36,581 --> 02:27:38,811
writing her new book.

1369
02:27:38,916 --> 02:27:40,816
Yes.

1370
02:27:49,060 --> 02:27:50,960
I am.

1371
02:28:12,416 --> 02:28:14,543
Dear Janet...

1372
02:28:14,652 --> 02:28:17,678
I wish there was a way
to break this news more gently.

1373
02:28:19,090 --> 02:28:21,422
Dad is dead.

1374
02:28:21,525 --> 02:28:26,155
He was cycling to work on the North Road
when he collapsed and died later in hospital.

1375
02:28:27,932 --> 02:28:32,562
Poor Dad. He hasn 't properly
cared for himself since Mum died.

1376
02:28:32,670 --> 02:28:35,366
Bruddie says the house
is a rubbish heap.

1377
02:31:15,433 --> 02:31:17,333
Miss Frame?

1378
02:31:19,203 --> 02:31:22,297
Ken Bowker
from the local paper, Miss Frame.

1379
02:31:22,406 --> 02:31:24,374
Can we come up?

1380
02:31:27,845 --> 02:31:29,745
Yes.

1381
02:31:47,131 --> 02:31:51,033
Sorry to disturb you.
We wanted to beat the Dunedin papers to it.

1382
02:31:53,637 --> 02:31:56,231
- To what?
- Your story.

1383
02:31:58,476 --> 02:32:00,603
Can you bend your knees?

1384
02:32:07,885 --> 02:32:10,183
Can we have one sitting,
Miss Frame?

1385
02:32:10,287 --> 02:32:12,187
Sitting.

1386
02:32:15,893 --> 02:32:19,420
Um - Like this?

1387
02:32:21,165 --> 02:32:23,497
That's good.

1388
02:32:34,678 --> 02:32:37,374
Come on, baby

1389
02:32:37,481 --> 02:32:39,972
Let's do the twist

1390
02:32:41,018 --> 02:32:43,816
Come on, baby

1391
02:32:43,921 --> 02:32:46,116
Let's do the twist

1392
02:32:46,223 --> 02:32:49,249
- Pamela, come to bed, please?
- Take me by my little hand

1393
02:32:50,427 --> 02:32:53,157
And go like this

1394
02:32:53,264 --> 02:32:55,755
- Coffee?
