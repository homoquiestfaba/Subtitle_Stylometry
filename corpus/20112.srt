00:00:26,521 --> 00:00:30,514
Tales of monstrous,
man-eating anacondas -

2
00:00:30,681 --> 00:00:34,674
- have been told for centuries
by Amazon tribes.

3
00:00:34,841 --> 00:00:38,277
Some are said
to worship giant snakes.

4
00:00:38,441 --> 00:00:42,036
Anacondas are ferocious,
and enormous.

5
00:00:42,201 --> 00:00:45,193
They can grow up to 40 feet long.

6
00:00:45,361 --> 00:00:48,751
They do not merely eat their prey.

7
00:00:48,921 --> 00:00:52,277
They regurgitate it
in order to kill and eat again.

8
00:02:29,801 --> 00:02:34,033
Please, help!
Somebody, help!

9
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:40,794
This is an emergency.
Somebody, please!

10
00:03:06,601 --> 00:03:10,958
Please ...

11
00:04:27,121 --> 00:04:32,115
ARlAU JUNGLE HOTEL, BRAZlL
DEEP lN THE AMAZON

12
00:05:06,081 --> 00:05:11,394
- Miss Flores.
- Professor. When did you get in?

13
00:05:11,561 --> 00:05:16,840
A couple of days ago. l've been out
asking about our tribe.

14
00:05:17,001 --> 00:05:22,917
- Any luck?
- The evidence is they're out there.

15
00:05:23,081 --> 00:05:27,120
And can be found ...
or so l told the grant people!

16
00:05:27,281 --> 00:05:32,514
My guide thinks they're here.
He found one of their markers.

17
00:05:32,681 --> 00:05:36,993
- That's good!
- l think we have a chance.

18
00:05:37,161 --> 00:05:41,677
- Get me there, and l'll shoot it.
- That's why I hired you.

19
00:05:41,841 --> 00:05:46,869
- l appreciate the work.
- l wanted the best director.

20
00:05:47,041 --> 00:05:50,397
l think we'll make a good team.

21
00:05:50,561 --> 00:05:53,553
You're a mess. What happened?

22
00:05:53,721 --> 00:05:58,841
Just a small piranha attack.
l barely escaped with my life.

23
00:06:14,601 --> 00:06:21,837
- Somebody's up awfully early.
- Well, today's a good day.

24
00:06:22,001 --> 00:06:27,200
Not every day my home girl
gets to direct a documentary.

25
00:06:27,361 --> 00:06:31,798
- You ready?
- l think so.

26
00:06:32,881 --> 00:06:36,669
- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

27
00:06:37,921 --> 00:06:40,674
ls this a pleasure cruise?

28
00:06:40,841 --> 00:06:45,790
You know me.
l don't mix business with pleasure.

29
00:06:45,961 --> 00:06:49,271
lf we go up through here ..?

30
00:06:49,441 --> 00:06:55,596
This way better.
lf not, l cannot be responsible.

31
00:06:55,761 --> 00:07:01,597
Well, it's only 55 kilometers more.
Better safe than sorry.

32
00:07:01,761 --> 00:07:06,039
- Mateo, you understand me?
- Sure.

33
00:07:06,201 --> 00:07:12,071
- l need some shots over there.
- As you say, cheffe .

34
00:07:12,241 --> 00:07:19,352
- Where's Westridge? He checked in.
- Probably getting his beauty sleep.

35
00:07:19,521 --> 00:07:21,159
Careful!

36
00:07:21,321 --> 00:07:26,395
Careful! Bordeaux!
Fragile. Expensive wine.

37
00:07:26,561 --> 00:07:31,874
- Christ! Good morning.
- Morning. How was your flight?

38
00:07:32,041 --> 00:07:37,069
Actually, it was a bloody nightmare.
Ongoing, l think.

39
00:07:37,241 --> 00:07:41,996
- One zoom lens ...
- You! Stow this in my room.

40
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:46,120
l'm the production manager.

41
00:07:46,281 --> 00:07:51,480
- Then manage them into my room!
- One pompous ass ...

42
00:07:51,641 --> 00:07:56,112
ln some cultures, asking you
to carry bags shows respect.

43
00:07:56,281 --> 00:07:59,079
Respect this!

44
00:07:59,241 --> 00:08:02,631
Terri Flores.

45
00:08:02,801 --> 00:08:07,238
l've seen some of your films.
They were ... promising.

46
00:08:07,401 --> 00:08:12,270
- lt's hot! Are we on the equator?
- Welcome aboard ... l guess.

47
00:08:12,441 --> 00:08:16,514
- He likes you!
- You felt that too?

48
00:08:16,681 --> 00:08:19,241
lt's Jacques Cousteau!

49
00:08:19,401 --> 00:08:26,512
- joinez-moi avec mon équipe ...
- Whatever the hell that means ...

50
00:08:26,681 --> 00:08:29,354
Ready for Rio Negro!

51
00:08:30,041 --> 00:08:35,798
Everybody! Check your gear and
pray you remembered bug spray.

52
00:08:53,361 --> 00:08:59,357
Our adventure begins 1,000 miles
from the mouth of the Amazon.

53
00:08:59,521 --> 00:09:04,470
From here, we travel
unexplored backwaters -

54
00:09:04,641 --> 00:09:09,157
- in search of the Mist People,
the Shirishama.

55
00:09:09,321 --> 00:09:13,360
On of the last mysteries
of the Rain Forest.

56
00:09:29,121 --> 00:09:33,319
ls it just me,
or does the jungle make you horny?

57
00:09:35,081 --> 00:09:40,394
- l think it's the jungle.
- l've got one thing on my mind.

58
00:09:40,561 --> 00:09:43,314
Can l work, please?

59
00:09:58,401 --> 00:10:01,040
Help!

60
00:10:02,441 --> 00:10:06,593
Save me! l'm stranded.

61
00:10:06,761 --> 00:10:11,391
My boat is stranded in the ropes.
Help me!

62
00:10:15,761 --> 00:10:18,992
There's a dude on a boat over there.

63
00:10:19,161 --> 00:10:22,836
Pull over to his boat!

64
00:10:25,761 --> 00:10:29,549
We'll bring you on board.

65
00:10:35,921 --> 00:10:38,754
Thank the Lord for you!

66
00:10:40,441 --> 00:10:46,676
- Are you okay?
- The roots tore off my propeller.

67
00:10:46,841 --> 00:10:50,800
We can't take you back to Manaus.

68
00:10:50,961 --> 00:10:56,160
At the next village, l know the
people. They will help me.

69
00:10:56,321 --> 00:11:00,997
- l apologize for the trouble.
- There's no need.

70
00:11:01,161 --> 00:11:06,440
We're all at the mercy of machines.
Yours broke.

71
00:11:06,801 --> 00:11:10,760
Mateo, vamonos.

72
00:11:32,241 --> 00:11:36,678
- Fish, river style!
- Not bad!

73
00:11:36,841 --> 00:11:40,277
We should get that on film.

74
00:11:44,161 --> 00:11:48,632
- Ever work in a sushi bar, Mr ..?
- Paul Sarone.

75
00:11:48,801 --> 00:11:53,829
- Where are you from, Mr. Sarone?
- Paraguay.

76
00:11:54,001 --> 00:11:56,674
l studied to be a priest.

77
00:11:56,841 --> 00:12:01,039
But then l needed to see
the real world.

78
00:12:01,201 --> 00:12:05,991
So l ended up in the jungle.
l seem to fit.

79
00:12:06,161 --> 00:12:09,870
What does a failed priest do here?

80
00:12:10,041 --> 00:12:15,240
Who says l failed?
l didn't fail.

81
00:12:15,401 --> 00:12:19,076
So what is your calling now?

82
00:12:19,961 --> 00:12:24,034
Snakes.
l catch them.

83
00:12:24,201 --> 00:12:28,160
- For zoos and collectors.
- Poaching?

84
00:12:30,401 --> 00:12:34,394
Poaching is illegal.
What are you hunting?

85
00:12:34,561 --> 00:12:37,200
We're not hunting anything.

86
00:12:37,361 --> 00:12:43,038
We're making a documentary
on the Shirishama lndians.

87
00:12:43,201 --> 00:12:46,716
- The People of the Mist?
- You know of them?

88
00:12:46,881 --> 00:12:51,909
- l've seen them.
- Could you show me where?

89
00:12:52,081 --> 00:12:58,839
You saved my life. l can show you
exactly where l saw them.

90
00:13:00,161 --> 00:13:05,838
So slurs every river rat after
five whiskies in any Manaus bar.

91
00:13:06,001 --> 00:13:10,597
Five whiskies?
That's breakfast on the river.

92
00:13:13,321 --> 00:13:17,633
Does salad go well
with fish river style?

93
00:13:17,801 --> 00:13:21,919
Salad would be perfect,
little baby bird.

94
00:13:43,961 --> 00:13:46,873
Look at that.

95
00:13:50,041 --> 00:13:53,238
Are they fireflies?

96
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:59,116
Pretty, huh?
Family Lampyridae.

97
00:13:59,281 --> 00:14:05,754
They use their night flashes to
announce that they're ready to mate.

98
00:14:07,081 --> 00:14:12,360
- Who flashes? Males or females?
- Both, actually.

99
00:14:12,521 --> 00:14:18,118
The females with short,
dainty, feminine flashes, -

100
00:14:18,281 --> 00:14:23,992
- and the males with long,
drawn-out, manly flashes.

101
00:14:26,041 --> 00:14:31,274
l like that. No pick-up lines,
no misunderstandings.

102
00:14:31,441 --> 00:14:35,400
Just instinct and nature.

103
00:14:40,921 --> 00:14:44,391
l've missed you.

104
00:15:47,321 --> 00:15:50,199
Bloody racket!

105
00:15:51,161 --> 00:15:54,836
Hey! Don't touch my radio!

106
00:16:03,201 --> 00:16:07,991
l could cheerfully hire someone
to kill you.

107
00:16:08,161 --> 00:16:13,189
- 15 dollars should cover it.
- l could just kill you for free.

108
00:16:15,321 --> 00:16:19,712
- You and whose army?
- Your mama's!

109
00:16:21,241 --> 00:16:24,358
Are we getting close?

110
00:16:24,521 --> 00:16:28,560
- Just around this bend.
- Perfect.

111
00:16:49,321 --> 00:16:51,960
A snake totem pole.

112
00:16:52,801 --> 00:16:56,476
lt's the Shirishama's.

113
00:16:56,641 --> 00:17:02,238
They worship giant snakes.
Anacondas. As gods and protectors.

114
00:17:02,401 --> 00:17:06,474
They have a legend
of a journey to a sacred lake.

115
00:17:06,641 --> 00:17:09,917
First you pass a waterfall
with warrior snakes.

116
00:17:10,081 --> 00:17:14,871
Then you travel through the land
of the Shirishama, -

117
00:17:15,041 --> 00:17:19,751
- until you come to a wall so high,
it blots out the sky ...

118
00:17:19,921 --> 00:17:25,951
Then after five days, you reach
the head of a giant anaconda.

119
00:17:27,041 --> 00:17:31,592
- You know the story.
- A beautiful legend ...

120
00:17:31,761 --> 00:17:34,719
... of the Maku.

121
00:17:34,881 --> 00:17:38,840
- Also the Shirishama.
- Not to my knowledge.

122
00:17:39,001 --> 00:17:44,314
Their village was right here.
They're down this fork.

123
00:17:44,481 --> 00:17:50,317
- l know. l trap snakes.
- And l'm sure you're good at it.

124
00:17:50,481 --> 00:17:54,599
l locate tribes.
l'm very good at that.

125
00:17:54,761 --> 00:17:59,391
The water is high,
so this side is flooded.

126
00:17:59,561 --> 00:18:04,555
So our tribe would seek
higher ground over here.

127
00:18:04,721 --> 00:18:09,158
- Which way?
- This way.

128
00:18:10,241 --> 00:18:15,838
l want a shot of you with the totem.
Gary, roll sound.

129
00:18:16,601 --> 00:18:18,592
Camera rolling.

130
00:18:18,761 --> 00:18:24,119
Our first piece of luck:
a Shirishama idol.

131
00:18:24,281 --> 00:18:28,877
l know what l know.
Leave me at the next village.

132
00:18:29,601 --> 00:18:32,593
With pleasure.

133
00:18:32,761 --> 00:18:36,834
What the hell was that all about?

134
00:18:58,081 --> 00:19:03,997
- We'll go get some wild sound.
- Just be careful.

135
00:19:04,161 --> 00:19:07,836
See you guys.

136
00:19:22,601 --> 00:19:25,434
Gary ...

137
00:19:47,481 --> 00:19:50,712
lt's unbelievable.

138
00:19:53,001 --> 00:19:56,596
- Gary ...
- What?

139
00:20:01,441 --> 00:20:05,116
Oh my God!

140
00:20:24,321 --> 00:20:26,755
Wait.

141
00:20:26,921 --> 00:20:30,038
Do you hear that?

142
00:20:30,881 --> 00:20:34,510
The silence.

143
00:20:56,681 --> 00:21:00,674
- What was that?
- l don't know.

144
00:21:03,881 --> 00:21:07,112
Mateo, shine the light over there.

145
00:21:16,801 --> 00:21:19,793
These two are fortunate to be alive.

146
00:21:19,961 --> 00:21:25,558
- What happened?
- You should have seen it!

147
00:21:25,721 --> 00:21:30,078
He just blasted this thing
coming right at us.

148
00:21:32,361 --> 00:21:37,879
Wild boar. Gores with his tusks.
Goes for the eyes.

149
00:21:38,041 --> 00:21:42,080
- Denise, are you okay?
- Yeah, thanks.

150
00:21:42,241 --> 00:21:48,237
- Everybody stays on board at night.
- That's a smart idea.

151
00:21:52,001 --> 00:21:55,994
Mateo, let's cut him up.
Food for a week.

152
00:21:58,121 --> 00:22:00,715
Food?

153
00:22:23,281 --> 00:22:27,115
- My turn?
- lt's my turn.

154
00:22:38,361 --> 00:22:42,320
Mateo,
do you have control of this vessel?

155
00:22:42,481 --> 00:22:45,917
Lie, if you must.

156
00:22:47,601 --> 00:22:51,230
The rope's caught in the propeller.

157
00:22:58,401 --> 00:23:00,551
l'll cut us loose.

158
00:23:00,721 --> 00:23:04,873
Let me.
This river can kill you 1,000 ways.

159
00:23:05,041 --> 00:23:11,230
l can handle it. The only thing
l'm afraid of is the candiru acu .

160
00:23:11,401 --> 00:23:17,431
lt's a tiny little catfish.
lt swims up into your urethra, -

161
00:23:17,601 --> 00:23:23,233
- spreads its little spines
and refuses to budge.

162
00:23:24,441 --> 00:23:29,720
- You have to cut it out.
- That's it! l'm going back to L.A.

163
00:24:39,121 --> 00:24:43,080
Terri, something's wrong!

164
00:24:43,241 --> 00:24:45,880
Cale?

165
00:24:46,761 --> 00:24:50,640
- He's hurt. l'm going.
- Hold up!

166
00:24:53,121 --> 00:24:56,113
Hurry up!

167
00:24:59,001 --> 00:25:03,631
ls he breathing?
Faster, come on!

168
00:25:05,481 --> 00:25:08,678
Hurry!

169
00:25:08,841 --> 00:25:11,674
What is it?

170
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:16,317
Careful.

171
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:22,238
- Get something for his head.
- He's not breathing.

172
00:25:23,121 --> 00:25:25,840
ln his mouth.

173
00:25:26,001 --> 00:25:31,234
- Oh my God!
- Damn! What's that?

174
00:25:31,801 --> 00:25:36,750
A wasp.
Deadly. Poisonous.

175
00:25:38,121 --> 00:25:41,955
He's not breathing.
What do we do?

176
00:25:43,321 --> 00:25:47,234
- How did this happen?
- Alcohol.

177
00:25:47,841 --> 00:25:50,958
l've got whiskey in my flask.

178
00:25:53,881 --> 00:25:57,669
- Quickly.
- What's that for?

179
00:26:07,641 --> 00:26:12,999
- He's breathing!
- That's it. He'll be all right.

180
00:26:32,681 --> 00:26:38,517
- He seems okay, we should go now.
- The radio don't work.

181
00:26:38,681 --> 00:26:42,276
- l can't fix, okay?
- We can start now.

182
00:26:42,441 --> 00:26:45,558
No ... fog.

183
00:26:45,721 --> 00:26:50,556
We must get him to hospital soon,
or he'll die.

184
00:26:50,721 --> 00:26:55,078
What?
Terri, we got lights.

185
00:26:55,241 --> 00:27:00,315
Good.
Mateo, we'll just double back.

186
00:27:00,481 --> 00:27:04,759
Fighting the current, lose two days.

187
00:27:04,921 --> 00:27:10,234
Cut back to this tributary,
save us fifty miles.

188
00:27:12,681 --> 00:27:17,914
- The route you suggested yesterday.
- For a different reason.

189
00:27:18,081 --> 00:27:23,075
Now, it's to get Professor Cale
to hospital as fast as possible.

190
00:27:26,281 --> 00:27:31,196
l hope you know what you're doing.
l don't know about this dude.

191
00:27:31,361 --> 00:27:34,000
What choice do l have?

192
00:28:20,201 --> 00:28:25,036
What the hell is this?
Terri, come here.

193
00:28:30,921 --> 00:28:36,632
- This is the river you know?
- No, this is new.

194
00:28:37,721 --> 00:28:41,475
But no cause for panic.

195
00:28:44,161 --> 00:28:49,679
l'm not panicking. l'm just looking
at this wall blocking our way.

196
00:28:49,841 --> 00:28:54,357
- Let's see what we can do.
- Dynamite?

197
00:28:54,521 --> 00:28:58,230
lt's always good to be prepared.

198
00:28:58,401 --> 00:29:04,920
- But it must be there for a reason.
- Yeah, to keep us out.

199
00:29:05,081 --> 00:29:09,359
We could upset
the ecological balance of the river.

200
00:29:09,521 --> 00:29:13,116
l can blow it in ten minutes, -

201
00:29:13,281 --> 00:29:17,911
- or we can turn around
and lose two days.

202
00:29:21,001 --> 00:29:23,595
Terri?

203
00:29:24,321 --> 00:29:28,360
For God's sake,
blow the bloody thing!

204
00:29:29,761 --> 00:29:33,674
Just give me ten minutes, people.

205
00:29:33,841 --> 00:29:38,710
l need help.
Gary, get the little boat.

206
00:30:23,241 --> 00:30:26,313
- There's something down there.
- Yes.

207
00:30:26,481 --> 00:30:30,030
- l mean it.
- l mean it too.

208
00:30:34,041 --> 00:30:37,317
Hurry.

209
00:31:09,761 --> 00:31:13,071
Damn it! Snakes!

210
00:31:16,001 --> 00:31:20,392
- Babies!
- How do we get them off the boat?

211
00:31:20,561 --> 00:31:24,349
Come on, back to Mama.

212
00:31:27,961 --> 00:31:30,714
They're not all babies.

213
00:31:33,161 --> 00:31:35,880
Calm.

214
00:31:36,041 --> 00:31:40,796
- You little shit!
- Sarone, help him.

215
00:31:40,961 --> 00:31:45,512
Someone get this bloody thing
off my hand!

216
00:31:47,561 --> 00:31:53,272
- So young, and so lethal.
- Get it off me!

217
00:31:58,121 --> 00:32:00,476
Later, Sweetie!

218
00:32:00,641 --> 00:32:06,193
- You knew there were snakes here!
- lt was a pleasant surprise.

219
00:32:06,361 --> 00:32:11,196
- What about the fuel?
- There's only enough for 100 km.

220
00:32:11,361 --> 00:32:15,559
About a day's ride.
That will have to do.

221
00:32:15,721 --> 00:32:18,394
Back to your mother.

222
00:32:34,481 --> 00:32:40,113
- How's he doing?
- He's breathing normally now.

223
00:32:40,281 --> 00:32:46,595
- We'll get him home.
- l just don't know what's going on.

224
00:32:49,041 --> 00:32:52,829
He's supposed to get us to hospital.

225
00:32:53,001 --> 00:32:56,755
But he acts like he owns this river.

226
00:32:56,921 --> 00:33:02,757
And we run into a barrier full of
snakes. Where's he taking us?

227
00:33:31,081 --> 00:33:34,869
Mateo. Stop the boat.

228
00:33:39,481 --> 00:33:43,315
Why are we stopping now?

229
00:33:43,481 --> 00:33:46,678
There'll be fuel.

230
00:33:49,401 --> 00:33:54,111
- You know that boat?
- There's lots of boats like that.

231
00:34:05,521 --> 00:34:10,151
l get the impression
there's nobody home.

232
00:34:10,321 --> 00:34:14,280
Mateo, come with me.

233
00:34:14,481 --> 00:34:17,075
Hold up.

234
00:34:17,241 --> 00:34:21,917
- l'lI get this on film.
- You don't need sound, do you?

235
00:35:32,601 --> 00:35:35,434
Go aft.

236
00:36:16,281 --> 00:36:21,480
- Kind of spooky.
- You think so?

237
00:36:31,641 --> 00:36:33,632
What the ...

238
00:37:11,681 --> 00:37:15,151
- Help me.
- What's that?

239
00:37:15,321 --> 00:37:18,074
Treasures.

240
00:37:26,201 --> 00:37:28,715
Here.

241
00:37:31,721 --> 00:37:34,713
Careful, my camera's in here.

242
00:37:44,561 --> 00:37:47,678
Mateo, let's go!

243
00:37:48,041 --> 00:37:52,273
l'm coming.

244
00:38:24,161 --> 00:38:28,279
- What about the fuel?
- There wasn't any.

245
00:38:28,441 --> 00:38:33,151
- Where's Mateo?
- He was right behind us.

246
00:38:35,041 --> 00:38:37,760
Mateo!

247
00:38:43,521 --> 00:38:47,753
- l'm going back.
- Sarone, go with him.

248
00:38:47,921 --> 00:38:53,393
- Maybe some other time.
- Asshole.

249
00:38:59,121 --> 00:39:02,113
Now we've lost our driver!

250
00:39:03,401 --> 00:39:07,189
Mateo!

251
00:39:10,881 --> 00:39:13,873
Come on man, stop playing!

252
00:39:39,481 --> 00:39:42,200
Danny?

253
00:39:54,161 --> 00:39:57,392
- Yeah.
- You okay?

254
00:39:57,561 --> 00:40:02,760
- l'm all right. l didn't see him.
- How very reassuring!

255
00:40:03,681 --> 00:40:07,959
- This is it.
- This is all you found?

256
00:40:11,481 --> 00:40:15,838
- What the hell is this?
- Anaconda skin.

257
00:40:16,001 --> 00:40:19,437
- This big?
- It's maybe four years old.

258
00:40:19,601 --> 00:40:26,552
lt's grown by now. Something like
this made a meal of our captain.

259
00:40:28,161 --> 00:40:32,951
- Snakes don't eat people.
- They don't?

260
00:40:34,241 --> 00:40:39,315
Anacondas are killing machines.
They have heat sensors.

261
00:40:39,481 --> 00:40:44,396
A warm body like Mateo's
wasn't hard to find.

262
00:40:44,561 --> 00:40:49,760
They wrap around you.
Hold you tighter than your lover.

263
00:40:49,921 --> 00:40:56,110
You get to hear your bones break
before your veins explode.

264
00:40:58,001 --> 00:41:02,950
- Mateo's probably just lost.
- Oh, wake up!

265
00:41:03,121 --> 00:41:09,435
lmagine capturing it alive.
That's worth a lot of money, Gary.

266
00:41:10,281 --> 00:41:17,357
Please people, don't make me out
to be a monster. l didn't eat Mateo.

267
00:41:19,241 --> 00:41:23,598
Come on, everybody ...
We are not sure that Mateo is dead.

268
00:41:23,761 --> 00:41:27,197
- We'll wait here till morning.
- Are you insane?

269
00:41:27,361 --> 00:41:32,594
You think he went for a walk?
We've got to get out of here.

270
00:41:32,761 --> 00:41:37,596
Get a grip! lf it was you,
you'd want us to stay.

271
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:42,755
Listen!
lf it was me out there, l'd be dead.

272
00:41:42,921 --> 00:41:50,635
- Go to your cabin, lock the door.
- Like a bad boy. All right.

273
00:41:50,801 --> 00:41:54,157
Where are my shoes?

274
00:41:54,321 --> 00:42:00,078
- We'll aim some lights at the boat.
- That's a good idea.

275
00:42:21,881 --> 00:42:25,999
l'm not so sure
he didn't eat the captain.

276
00:42:26,161 --> 00:42:29,631
He sure looks satiated.

277
00:42:33,081 --> 00:42:36,756
You think he's still alive?

278
00:42:36,921 --> 00:42:40,231
No. Let's go to bed.

279
00:42:42,641 --> 00:42:45,030
Danger ...

280
00:42:45,681 --> 00:42:48,991
Danger is exciting, huh, Gary?

281
00:42:50,001 --> 00:42:54,950
You go on to bed,
l'll just talk to him a second.

282
00:42:55,121 --> 00:42:59,990
- Hurry up, l'm scared.
- l'll be right there.

283
00:43:07,881 --> 00:43:11,999
- So ... lt's out there, isn't it?
- Yeah.

284
00:43:12,161 --> 00:43:16,234
- And you know how to catch it?
- That's right.

285
00:43:16,401 --> 00:43:21,521
But you can't catch it by yourself,
you need a partner.

286
00:43:21,681 --> 00:43:27,392
Capture alive ...
Maybe a million dollars, Gary.

287
00:43:38,241 --> 00:43:40,914
REPTlLE TRANQUlLLlZER

288
00:44:02,641 --> 00:44:06,031
Still no Mateo.

289
00:44:47,521 --> 00:44:50,831
Keep it steady, Westridge!

290
00:45:01,041 --> 00:45:05,273
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Anaconda bait.

291
00:45:05,441 --> 00:45:08,353
Oh my God!

292
00:45:13,441 --> 00:45:17,673
- Let's go.
- Stop! Not on my boat.

293
00:45:17,841 --> 00:45:24,110
You speak for everybody? Gary?
Does she speak for everybody?

294
00:45:26,961 --> 00:45:29,475
Gary?

295
00:45:29,641 --> 00:45:35,273
With Cale sick, the movie's off.
Why not salvage something?

296
00:45:36,921 --> 00:45:41,233
Let's film Sarone
capturing a big snake.

297
00:45:41,401 --> 00:45:46,634
- Have you lost your mind?
- No, l'm completely lucid.

298
00:45:46,801 --> 00:45:50,032
lt's you who need
to open your eyes.

299
00:45:50,201 --> 00:45:55,229
We were taking Cale to hospital,
now we're catching a snake?

300
00:45:55,401 --> 00:46:00,395
You're in the middle of the jungle!
You question and criticize, -

301
00:46:00,561 --> 00:46:05,476
- but you don't know shit
about all this. Neither do l.

302
00:46:05,641 --> 00:46:11,159
But l know who does. This guy!
Paul has been here.

303
00:46:11,321 --> 00:46:16,111
lf we help him catch the snake,
he'll get us out.

304
00:46:16,281 --> 00:46:19,591
And that is common freaking sense.

305
00:46:19,761 --> 00:46:25,438
Come on, Gary, this isn't you!
What did he do to you?

306
00:46:25,601 --> 00:46:28,354
Think of the money.

307
00:46:28,521 --> 00:46:34,596
lmagine filming something like this
for the first time ever.

308
00:46:35,921 --> 00:46:39,709
- What else can we do?
- l know what l'm doing.

309
00:46:39,881 --> 00:46:43,430
l'm gonna throw you two
in the river!

310
00:46:47,121 --> 00:46:52,320
- l don't think so.
- I didn't want this to happen.

311
00:46:52,481 --> 00:46:54,756
Let's go, Westridge.

312
00:46:58,481 --> 00:47:02,190
Occupy yourselves.
Play cards.

313
00:48:22,441 --> 00:48:25,274
Nobody move!

314
00:49:00,281 --> 00:49:04,911
Gary, turn on the lights!

315
00:49:05,081 --> 00:49:08,357
Stop the boat.

316
00:49:11,601 --> 00:49:14,274
Buenas noches!

317
00:49:14,441 --> 00:49:17,877
- Come here, Westridge.
- You'll get us killed!

318
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:24,116
That's it, go for the eyes!
Blind it!

319
00:49:24,281 --> 00:49:27,751
Fishing for snakes! He's crazy!

320
00:49:27,921 --> 00:49:31,994
- Just let it go.
- Westridge, come here!

321
00:49:59,081 --> 00:50:02,517
Where is it?

322
00:50:22,881 --> 00:50:26,669
Don't move. l'll tranquillize it.

323
00:50:45,721 --> 00:50:48,519
Denise, get up here!

324
00:50:52,961 --> 00:50:56,590
Gary, help me!

325
00:50:56,761 --> 00:50:59,992
- Get up here!
- Grab her, man!

326
00:51:03,561 --> 00:51:06,473
lt's in the water.

327
00:51:20,881 --> 00:51:23,918
Gary, give me your hand.

328
00:51:29,921 --> 00:51:33,675
lt's no good to me dead.

329
00:51:36,921 --> 00:51:38,832
Gary!

330
00:51:40,521 --> 00:51:43,194
Oh God!

331
00:52:19,881 --> 00:52:24,511
May the souls
of the faithful departed ...

332
00:52:24,681 --> 00:52:28,833
... through the mercy of God
rest in peace.

333
00:52:30,161 --> 00:52:34,598
- Westridge!
- How dare you!

334
00:52:34,761 --> 00:52:39,755
lt was you who brought that snake.
You brought the devil.

335
00:52:41,121 --> 00:52:44,079
There's a devil inside everyone.

336
00:52:44,241 --> 00:52:47,153
Horrible ...

337
00:52:47,321 --> 00:52:50,791
Westridge.

338
00:52:55,841 --> 00:52:59,277
Take my gear up to the pilot house.

339
00:52:59,441 --> 00:53:03,229
- l'm not your bloody poodle.
- What?

340
00:53:03,401 --> 00:53:08,839
- You presume to order me about?
- Presume?

341
00:53:09,001 --> 00:53:13,279
How you like l presume
to throw you in the river?

342
00:53:14,601 --> 00:53:18,071
- Take it upstairs.
- Thank you.

343
00:53:21,161 --> 00:53:24,995
Everyone else, don't move.

344
00:53:25,161 --> 00:53:28,153
Get back.

345
00:53:43,081 --> 00:53:46,551
Terri, let's talk.

346
00:55:07,761 --> 00:55:11,515
You want something?

347
00:55:13,241 --> 00:55:16,950
l just want to talk to you.

348
00:55:23,361 --> 00:55:27,320
I was thinking about the myth.

349
00:55:27,481 --> 00:55:33,795
You know, this film
was supposed to be my big break.

350
00:55:36,241 --> 00:55:40,234
And it's turned out
to be a big disaster.

351
00:55:44,441 --> 00:55:48,673
So l was just thinking -

352
00:55:48,841 --> 00:55:54,837
- that maybe l could film you
capturing the snake.

353
00:55:58,441 --> 00:56:03,959
And then it wouldn't have
all been for nothing.

354
00:56:04,121 --> 00:56:08,080
lt could be dangerous.

355
00:56:08,241 --> 00:56:11,836
l know.

356
00:56:15,241 --> 00:56:18,358
But you'd be there to protect us.

357
00:56:18,521 --> 00:56:23,072
You need protection?

358
00:56:26,081 --> 00:56:31,155
lt's been a long time ...
since l had a woman.

359
00:56:42,481 --> 00:56:45,632
You think l'm stupid?

360
00:56:46,921 --> 00:56:49,913
l'm not stupid!

361
00:56:53,121 --> 00:56:58,036
- Shall l hit him again?
- Throw him in the river!

362
00:56:58,201 --> 00:57:03,594
- l'm afraid l'd rather enjoy it.
- Just tie him up!

363
00:57:37,441 --> 00:57:41,070
This was all one big setup, huh?

364
00:57:41,241 --> 00:57:46,076
Mateo ... you, stranded ...
the shipwrecked boat ...

365
00:57:46,241 --> 00:57:51,838
- Your route to the hospital ...
- You forgot the wasp.

366
00:58:00,601 --> 00:58:05,755
What you do is not so hard.
l can trap a snake, too.

367
00:58:07,161 --> 00:58:12,474
As smart as you are,
you can survive without me.

368
00:58:22,001 --> 00:58:26,279
We're gonna be home soon, okay?

369
00:58:45,001 --> 00:58:50,075
l can't believe how good
you're doing. Hang in there, baby.

370
00:58:55,281 --> 00:59:00,833
- ls it hard to drive?
- No. Like a Cadillac Fleetwood.

371
00:59:01,001 --> 00:59:06,439
l'll give you a driving lesson.
Black knobs: Forward and back.

372
00:59:06,601 --> 00:59:10,037
Red knobs: Fast and slow.

373
00:59:10,201 --> 00:59:15,400
Wheel: left and right.
Any trouble, turn off the ignition.

374
00:59:15,561 --> 00:59:20,271
Take it for a spin.
Take us back to civilisation.

375
00:59:20,441 --> 00:59:25,913
- Shit, no problem!
- Take us back to ...

376
00:59:26,721 --> 00:59:31,954
- Crisp sheets and hot showers.
- The play-offs and a six-pack!

377
00:59:32,121 --> 00:59:37,275
- Golf, and a gin and tonic.
- L.A. traffic and mobile phones.

378
00:59:37,441 --> 00:59:40,001
Don't start!

379
01:00:03,281 --> 01:00:07,115
The waterfall.
A beautiful sight, baby bird.

380
01:00:07,961 --> 01:00:13,319
- The legend was right.
- What is this place?

381
01:00:15,601 --> 01:00:19,674
Oh dear.
lt's absolutely beautiful.

382
01:00:25,121 --> 01:00:29,319
- What the hell was that?
- l think we hit the bottom.

383
01:00:29,481 --> 01:00:33,474
Turn the wheel hard over left.

384
01:00:35,641 --> 01:00:37,871
Reverse.

385
01:00:39,761 --> 01:00:42,719
Shut it down.

386
01:00:56,441 --> 01:01:02,198
- We got to winch ourselves loose.
- And get in the water?

387
01:01:02,361 --> 01:01:07,560
We ain't got much choice.
We'll wrap a rope around that tree.

388
01:01:07,721 --> 01:01:12,715
You wrap a rope around thattree.
Or we're stuck here forever.

389
01:01:12,881 --> 01:01:19,036
- We've got to make it quick.
- l rather hoped l'd done my bit.

390
01:01:23,361 --> 01:01:26,751
- That's our rope.
- There's just enough.

391
01:01:26,921 --> 01:01:32,598
Take this and get it around
that trunk, so it's secure.

392
01:01:34,361 --> 01:01:39,640
Last time l tried this, l had to
pick leeches off my scrotum.

393
01:02:16,121 --> 01:02:19,158
Aren't you going to pray?

394
01:02:19,321 --> 01:02:23,519
Never look in the eyes
of those you kilI.

395
01:02:23,681 --> 01:02:28,152
They will haunt you forever.
l know.

396
01:02:38,601 --> 01:02:41,718
l firmly resolve ...

397
01:02:41,881 --> 01:02:45,396
... with help and grace
to confess my sins ...

398
01:02:45,561 --> 01:02:49,190
... and amend my life. Amen!

399
01:02:49,361 --> 01:02:54,310
Sanctus ... sanctus ...

400
01:02:54,481 --> 01:02:57,314
... baby bird.

401
01:03:17,961 --> 01:03:21,397
Hurry up.

402
01:03:37,201 --> 01:03:40,637
Back on the boat. Now!

403
01:03:42,241 --> 01:03:45,358
- Go!
- Christ!

404
01:03:46,921 --> 01:03:50,675
Get on the boat.
Go on, hurry!

405
01:03:57,681 --> 01:04:01,435
Over here, you fat-ass bastard!

406
01:04:13,961 --> 01:04:17,874
Get up on the rocks.

407
01:04:20,401 --> 01:04:23,632
lt's coming.

408
01:04:23,801 --> 01:04:27,237
Go get the gun. Get it!

409
01:04:32,841 --> 01:04:35,913
Hurry up!

410
01:04:36,721 --> 01:04:40,509
- Westridge, keep going!
- Danny, watch out!

411
01:05:10,601 --> 01:05:12,956
Move your arm!

412
01:05:48,641 --> 01:05:51,917
Danny!

413
01:05:55,521 --> 01:05:58,081
Westridge!

414
01:06:14,121 --> 01:06:17,193
Come on, hurry up!

415
01:06:17,361 --> 01:06:20,671
l'm caught.

416
01:06:23,161 --> 01:06:26,437
Hurry up.

417
01:06:47,561 --> 01:06:50,633
Danny, hold on!

418
01:07:27,761 --> 01:07:31,117
You killed my warrior snake.

419
01:07:35,121 --> 01:07:37,430
Get up.

420
01:07:37,601 --> 01:07:41,116
The dart.

421
01:07:46,281 --> 01:07:49,717
The tranquillizer's working.
Get him!

422
01:07:59,201 --> 01:08:02,193
Damn, the dart came out his back.

423
01:08:03,681 --> 01:08:07,754
Come on, almost there.

424
01:08:14,321 --> 01:08:18,872
Baby ..?
He's lost consciousness again.

425
01:08:20,321 --> 01:08:25,190
l'll try to get us out.
The tree knocked us loose.

426
01:08:38,521 --> 01:08:41,593
Terri, look.

427
01:09:00,841 --> 01:09:05,551
- They might have some fuel.
- Let's check it out.

428
01:09:09,281 --> 01:09:13,957
- Need some help?
- No, l'm cool.

429
01:09:30,961 --> 01:09:36,240
l don't even want to know
what happened here.

430
01:09:36,401 --> 01:09:40,189
l hope they got some fuel.

431
01:10:25,281 --> 01:10:28,398
Damn!

432
01:10:29,801 --> 01:10:33,271
Those drums ...
Could be fuel.

433
01:11:03,441 --> 01:11:06,513
A snake skin.

434
01:11:14,681 --> 01:11:18,720
- There's plenty of fuel in here.
- Welcome!

435
01:12:05,761 --> 01:12:09,071
Time to wake up.

436
01:12:17,921 --> 01:12:22,597
- Monkey blood.
- l'm gonna kill you, Sarone!

437
01:12:22,761 --> 01:12:26,674
Don't get me upset.

438
01:12:31,001 --> 01:12:33,674
See this?

439
01:12:33,841 --> 01:12:37,959
Human bones.
That's how it comes out.

440
01:12:38,121 --> 01:12:41,636
Ashes to ashes ...

441
01:12:56,641 --> 01:12:59,553
Shit, look!

442
01:12:59,721 --> 01:13:03,634
Come on.

443
01:13:30,281 --> 01:13:32,272
Go!

444
01:14:33,401 --> 01:14:36,359
Gotcha!

445
01:14:54,881 --> 01:14:57,236
Get loose.

446
01:15:21,841 --> 01:15:24,799
Let's get out!

447
01:15:28,961 --> 01:15:30,801
Just go!
Run! lt's coming for you.

448
01:15:30,801 --> 01:15:33,110
Just go!
Run! lt's coming for you.

449
01:16:23,601 --> 01:16:26,195
Danny, where are you?

450
01:16:27,201 --> 01:16:31,035
- lt's a nest.
- l'll go up the smokestack.

451
01:16:31,201 --> 01:16:34,671
- No, l've got the legs.
- We can trap it there.

452
01:16:36,681 --> 01:16:39,149
Go!

453
01:17:02,561 --> 01:17:06,520
- Can you climb out?
- l can use the rope.

454
01:17:06,681 --> 01:17:10,310
Hurry, l think l can blow him up.

455
01:17:22,601 --> 01:17:26,674
- l'm going to light it.
- Go ahead, l'm at the top.

456
01:17:32,201 --> 01:17:35,318
Danny!

457
01:17:41,201 --> 01:17:44,910
- Get out, the fuse is lit.
- Danny, wait!

458
01:17:47,561 --> 01:17:50,837
Hit the hinges.

459
01:18:07,641 --> 01:18:10,872
- Jump!
- l can't, it's too high.

460
01:18:55,401 --> 01:18:58,632
l got you. Come on.

461
01:19:01,721 --> 01:19:05,157
Did we get him?

462
01:19:08,961 --> 01:19:12,317
We got him.

463
01:19:14,281 --> 01:19:17,751
You all right?

464
01:19:19,641 --> 01:19:24,874
We should get the fuel,
so we can get out of here.

465
01:19:25,041 --> 01:19:28,192
Come on.

466
01:19:53,561 --> 01:19:56,792
Bitch.

467
01:20:02,601 --> 01:20:06,276
Let's get out of here.

468
01:20:20,681 --> 01:20:23,275
Miss Flores ...

469
01:20:25,921 --> 01:20:29,391
You're a mess.

470
01:20:52,801 --> 01:20:56,794
l found another one.
Let me see that.

471
01:20:58,561 --> 01:21:00,870
Shirishama.

472
01:21:01,761 --> 01:21:06,676
- Sarone was right.
- Danny!

473
01:21:15,641 --> 01:21:19,839
Damn ...
l'll get the camera.

474
01:21:21,881 --> 01:21:25,237
- Roll film!
- Camera rolling.

475
01:25:33,961 --> 01:25:38,352
English subtitles: lFT
