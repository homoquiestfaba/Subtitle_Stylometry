00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:25,562
 I kept my mouth shut!          

487
00:29:28,868 --> 00:29:30,134
         [WHISPERS]             
         I kept quiet.          

488
00:29:30,136 --> 00:29:32,369
             Honestly, I'm--    
             I'm not with state.

489
00:29:32,371 --> 00:29:34,438
  -Then what the fuck is this?  
  -I just-- I just--            

490
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,140
    -Huh?                       
    -I just need your help.     

491
00:29:36,142 --> 00:29:39,376
  -With what?                   
  -I have to save my company.   

492
00:29:39,378 --> 00:29:41,845
     -For what?                 
     -For-- For my family.      

493
00:29:41,847 --> 00:29:44,782
     See, and it all rests      
     on CHIP.                   

494
00:29:44,784 --> 00:29:46,850
Who told you                    
I invented CHIP?                

495
00:29:46,852 --> 00:29:47,951
               No one, I swear. 

496
00:29:47,953 --> 00:29:49,586
         See, uh-- Uh--         

497
00:29:49,588 --> 00:29:52,122
     I was at my doctor's,      
     and she reminded me        

498
00:29:52,124 --> 00:29:54,158
      about "Premium 3."        
      Now, I didn't think       

499
00:29:54,160 --> 00:29:57,461
 anything of it at the time,    
 but suddenly it dawned on me.  

500
00:29:57,463 --> 00:29:58,996
         Like a sign from above.

501
00:29:58,998 --> 00:30:01,665
        You know,               
        it all clicked.         

502
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,567
   I knew I had to find you.    

503
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:07,104
 MALE STATE CLERK:              
 Okay, how we all doin' today?  

504
00:30:07,106 --> 00:30:09,807
  Let me first just say,        
  congratulations to you both.  

505
00:30:11,177 --> 00:30:12,676
           Thank you.           

506
00:30:12,678 --> 00:30:15,579
    Your accomplishment         
    is very rare these days.    

507
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:16,680
            Accomplishment?     

508
00:30:16,682 --> 00:30:18,115
          Three kids.           

509
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:19,783
I mean, I'm not sure            
that you're aware,              

510
00:30:19,785 --> 00:30:21,585
but we are experiencing         

511
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:23,420
a massive decline               
in population                   

512
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:24,788
over the last few decades.      

513
00:30:24,790 --> 00:30:26,723
You know, people                
aren't getting married anymore. 

514
00:30:26,725 --> 00:30:28,425
   They're barely having sex.   

515
00:30:28,427 --> 00:30:31,762
Fewer and fewer                 
want the responsibility         

516
00:30:31,764 --> 00:30:34,431
   or the burden                
   or raising real children.    

517
00:30:34,433 --> 00:30:35,799
      Yeah, well, we know.      

518
00:30:35,801 --> 00:30:37,601
     My-my husband              
     works for Tech Broker,     

519
00:30:37,603 --> 00:30:39,536
 so he's at the very forefront  

520
00:30:39,538 --> 00:30:41,505
      of the technological      
      revolution.               

521
00:30:41,507 --> 00:30:43,140
     I wouldn't expect you,     

522
00:30:43,142 --> 00:30:44,875
   out of all people,           
   to father three children.    

523
00:30:44,877 --> 00:30:47,044
    No, you see, for me,        
    it's the exact opposite.    

524
00:30:47,046 --> 00:30:49,213
    Knowing the risks           
    has made me aim much bigger,

525
00:30:49,215 --> 00:30:51,915
         a proponent            
         for the physical world.

526
00:30:51,917 --> 00:30:54,685
We love the sound               
of that here at State.          

527
00:30:54,687 --> 00:30:57,454
You know, I think               
all those people                
out in the realm,               

528
00:30:57,456 --> 00:30:59,656
they forget that                
they still need                 
their physical bodies           

529
00:30:59,658 --> 00:31:02,593
in order to experience          
everything that they do there.  

530
00:31:02,595 --> 00:31:05,596
       I, for one,              
       am a true believer       

531
00:31:05,598 --> 00:31:08,165
    that nothing can replace    

532
00:31:08,167 --> 00:31:10,500
    the true sense of touch.    

533
00:31:11,203 --> 00:31:12,936
          The warmth.           

534
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:14,638
     Of another human body.     

535
00:31:20,546 --> 00:31:22,112
                   Okay, Mr....?

536
00:31:22,114 --> 00:31:24,481
       Ryan. Dennis Ryan.       

537
00:31:24,483 --> 00:31:26,984
     With all due respect,      
     what's this about?         

538
00:31:26,986 --> 00:31:28,719
      State is very aware       

539
00:31:28,721 --> 00:31:31,555
 of the many challenges         
 that today's would be parents  

540
00:31:31,557 --> 00:31:32,956
        are facing, and as such,

541
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:35,092
   State is highly committed    

542
00:31:35,094 --> 00:31:38,829
       to ensuring that         
       our plant survives       
       in good order            

543
00:31:38,831 --> 00:31:41,064
for the many future generations 
to come.                        

544
00:31:41,066 --> 00:31:43,767
    So what, is there           
    some kind of allowance?     

545
00:31:43,769 --> 00:31:45,769
          No. Heh. No.          

546
00:31:45,771 --> 00:31:47,004
 Nothing like that, Mrs. Bird,  

547
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:48,171
though our name may deceive you.

548
00:31:48,173 --> 00:31:49,706
   We put together a program    

549
00:31:49,708 --> 00:31:52,009
     that will protect          
     the future well being      

550
00:31:52,011 --> 00:31:53,610
     of the modern family.      

551
00:31:53,612 --> 00:31:55,178
    It's called "Premium 3."    

552
00:31:55,180 --> 00:31:57,714
      And it was designed       
      and spearheaded           

553
00:31:57,716 --> 00:31:59,850
    by our very own             
    chief genetic engineer.     

554
00:31:59,852 --> 00:32:01,084
      What, Donald Stein?       

555
00:32:01,086 --> 00:32:02,719
      Him and no other...       

556
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:04,655
       You invented "Premium 3."

557
00:32:04,657 --> 00:32:05,956
     And even before,           
     you were right there.      

558
00:32:05,958 --> 00:32:07,557
    I mean,                     
    from the very beginning,    

559
00:32:07,559 --> 00:32:08,992
  they called you               
  the father of human cloning.  

560
00:32:10,562 --> 00:32:12,796
I need a drink.                 

561
00:32:12,798 --> 00:32:14,598
   I'm happy to fix you one.    

562
00:32:19,305 --> 00:32:20,570
Do you smoke?                   

563
00:32:20,572 --> 00:32:21,905
         What does it look like?

564
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:23,607
You know what I mean.           
How?                            

565
00:32:23,609 --> 00:32:26,610
                I've got a guy  
                who's got a guy.

566
00:32:30,549 --> 00:32:31,782
You think we--?                 

567
00:32:33,252 --> 00:32:35,619
            How did you find me?

568
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:38,322
They pitched me                 
this roam tracker.              

569
00:32:38,324 --> 00:32:40,223
It hacks                        
every listed VR member          

570
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:41,625
in the Dental Association.      

571
00:32:41,627 --> 00:32:44,561
      Dental record, huh?       
      Clever.                   

572
00:32:44,563 --> 00:32:46,596
Then it looks                   
for virtual X-rays              

573
00:32:46,598 --> 00:32:49,066
that match                      
more than one identity.         

574
00:32:50,336 --> 00:32:54,137
You may be                      
the smartest man alive,         

575
00:32:54,139 --> 00:32:56,873
but Jerry Fischer               
and Donald Stein                

576
00:32:56,875 --> 00:32:58,842
have exactly                    
the same cavities.              

577
00:33:00,045 --> 00:33:02,012
Not to mention,                 
the same dentist.               

578
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:07,284
           [LAUGHING]           

579
00:33:08,954 --> 00:33:10,687
[ADAM LAUGHING]                 

580
00:33:10,689 --> 00:33:12,622
Yeah...                         

581
00:33:12,624 --> 00:33:14,891
Why did you fall off            
the grid?                       

582
00:33:14,893 --> 00:33:18,161
I mean, they said               
you went mad,                   

583
00:33:18,163 --> 00:33:22,132
but judging                     
by your paranoia,               

584
00:33:22,134 --> 00:33:25,302
I'd say you were pushed         
out the door.                   

585
00:33:25,304 --> 00:33:27,070
    Why don't you file that     

586
00:33:27,072 --> 00:33:28,872
      under none of             
      your damn business,       

587
00:33:28,874 --> 00:33:31,808
      and you tell me what      
      all this has to do        
      with CHIP.                

588
00:33:34,179 --> 00:33:36,880
  So how exactly does it work?  

589
00:33:36,882 --> 00:33:39,049
    Well, you both fill out     
    an application.             

590
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:42,119
  Now, the application allows   
  for a little bit of leeway,   

591
00:33:42,121 --> 00:33:44,287
       not too much,            
       but the idea being       

592
00:33:44,289 --> 00:33:46,690
 to satisfy                     
 the remaining mournful spouse, 

593
00:33:46,692 --> 00:33:48,058
   there is a little leeway.    

594
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,027
   What do you mean, leeway?    

595
00:33:50,029 --> 00:33:52,662
     You can tailor             
     your insurance spouse,     

596
00:33:52,664 --> 00:33:55,065
      a bit, so that            
      maybe they come back      

597
00:33:55,067 --> 00:33:56,700
      to you just perfect.      

598
00:34:01,707 --> 00:34:03,073
         Perfect, how?          

599
00:34:03,075 --> 00:34:04,975
  Well, I mean,                 
  that's all very subjective,   

600
00:34:04,977 --> 00:34:07,210
      but take Reena here,      
      for example.              

601
00:34:07,212 --> 00:34:09,746
    And I'm not...              
    I'm saying you love her.    

602
00:34:09,748 --> 00:34:11,314
     There's no doubt           
     how much you love her,     

603
00:34:11,316 --> 00:34:13,417
 but maybe aren't there things  

604
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:16,053
that you might think            
to yourself,                    

605
00:34:16,055 --> 00:34:18,388
"What if...?"                   

606
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,823
                       No.      

607
00:34:20,759 --> 00:34:21,892
         That's great.

this funny question.

01:16:04,427 --> 01:16:05,826
Take you, for example.

01:16:05,828 --> 01:16:07,595
 You were naturally conceived.  

1424
01:16:07,597 --> 01:16:09,463
  You're human and you think.   

1425
01:16:09,465 --> 01:16:11,766
     You have                   
     consciousness, but...      

1426
01:16:11,768 --> 01:16:14,168
    what about the cells        
    that make up your body?     

1427
01:16:14,170 --> 01:16:17,438
Are they conscious              
of being part of you?           

1428
01:16:17,440 --> 01:16:20,374
   I think they're programmed   
   to scratch an itch,

01:16:20,376 --> 01:16:22,310

        your question?          

1432
01:16:30,353 --> 01:16:32,954

  this whole meaningful life,   

1435
01:16:40,930 --> 01:16:43,264
       but in the end,          
       all you really are       

1436
01:16:43,266 --> 01:16:45,967

       in God's own body.       

1437
01:16:45,969 --> 01:16:48,469

  a bigger purpose out there.

01:16:48,471 --> 01:16:50,705

  supposed to achieve and why,
