{\an8}<i>Ghost rights.</i>

that spooky scenario just became real,</i>

00:33:45,750 --> 00:33:49,416
Make sure Anderson gets briefed
before we meet with Congressional Affairs.

Are you chewing gum?
What else we got? [exhales]

591

- [Leslie] Agent Schipley!

<i>- </i>[Leslie] Agent Schipley.

593

Leslie. What a lovely surprise.

594
00:33:59,041 --> 00:34:01,458
I've been calling your office
for the past three days.

595
00:34:01,541 --> 00:34:03,541
- Really? I didn't know.
- You saw this, right?

596

- Uh, no clue.
- It's an RHE.

597
00:34:05,875 --> 00:34:09,208
Leslie, I really appreciate you coming
all the way down here, but...

598
00:34:09,291 --> 00:34:12,375
I ran prelim diagnostics.
I couldn't find any foreign artifacts.

599
00:34:13,291 --> 00:34:16,208
Digital forensics, clean. This one's real.

600
00:34:16,291 --> 00:34:18,041
We need to reopen Wizard Clip.

601
00:34:18,125 --> 00:34:21,500
That program was mothballed 20 years ago
and for a good reason.

602
00:34:21,583 --> 00:34:23,958
This is our chance
to prove once and for all

603
00:34:24,041 --> 00:34:26,625
that spectral phenomena
is not some fantasy.

604

00:34:42,583 --> 00:34:45,916
This is crazy.
How you doing? Yo! What's up?

How do you feel about this ghost?

616
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,875
Can you tell us more about Ernest?

617

Yo, one second! One second!
Okay, all right! Yo!

618

Frank, please.
Frank, tell us, please, about the entity!

619
00:35:07,666 --> 00:35:09,833
- All right, okay, yeah.
- The supernatural entity, Ernest!

620
00:35:09,916 --> 00:35:11,666
When's the last time you saw Ernie?

621
00:35:11,750 --> 00:35:12,833
[reporters clamoring]

622
00:35:12,916 --> 00:35:15,333
How do you respond
to those who say this is all a hoax?

623
00:35:15,416 --> 00:35:17,166
Uh, if you think it's a hoax, look around.

624
00:35:17,250 --> 00:35:19,583
- There's a lot of people here. I mean…
- Is your family safe?

625
00:35:19,666 --> 00:35:21,458
- Is the community safe?
- When's the last time…

626
00:35:21,541 --> 00:35:23,791
Of course they're safe.
I mean, he's a ghost.

627
00:35:25,458 --> 00:35:27,208
Hey, thank you, guys!

628
00:35:31,791 --> 00:35:34,458
[Melanie] Who is coming into my house?

629
00:35:34,541 --> 00:35:37,708
You guys have a lot of nerve!
This is a private re…

630
00:35:37,791 --> 00:35:38,916
Frank!

631
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,458
- I know.
- This is insane.

632
00:35:40,541 --> 00:35:41,958
- [chuckles]
- I can't leave the house.

633
00:35:42,041 --> 00:35:43,083
It's not that bad.

634
00:35:43,166 --> 00:35:44,583
Whoa, not that bad?

635
00:35:44,666 --> 00:35:46,541
Someone tried
to crawl down the chimney today…

636
00:35:46,625 --> 00:35:49,250
- What?
- …to get in. Yeah! They got stuck.

637
00:35:49,333 --> 00:35:51,791
- I had to call the fire department.
- [chuckles]

638
00:35:51,875 --> 00:35:54,666
Do you know how crazy that is
to have a human being in there?

639
00:35:54,750 --> 00:35:56,250
- It ain't Christm...
- [knocking at door]

640
00:35:57,625 --> 00:35:58,791
- Jesus Christ.
- Ha!

641
00:35:58,875 --> 00:36:00,375
- Not funny.
- Oh…

642
00:36:00,458 --> 00:36:03,666
Hey, go away, or we're calling the cops.

643
00:36:04,208 --> 00:36:05,125
[Kevin sighs]

644
00:36:05,666 --> 00:36:10,750
Everything I've read says that
memory loss is connected to trauma.

645
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:13,000
It's a self-defense mechanism.

646
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:17,791
We need visual stimuli
to help trigger your memory.

647
00:36:19,583 --> 00:36:20,541
Oh my God.

648
00:36:22,333 --> 00:36:23,208
No?

649
00:36:24,791 --> 00:36:25,875
It's creepy.

650
00:36:30,250 --> 00:36:33,625
It's one of Dad's failed business things.

"Male enhancement pills."

652
00:36:34,958 --> 00:36:37,791
But instead of boners,
they just gave everyone diarrhea.

653
00:36:46,333 --> 00:36:47,416
Do you remember something?

654
00:36:53,291 --> 00:36:54,250
Okay. Okay.

655
00:36:54,333 --> 00:36:55,458
It's okay.

656

659
00:37:06,208 --> 00:37:07,583
[Frank] Move out, move.

660
00:37:12,666 --> 00:37:14,833
- You know, there's ghosts everywhere!
- Look at him.

661
00:37:16,708 --> 00:37:17,833
He loves it.

664
00:37:28,708 --> 00:37:30,125
"Why"? Why, what?

00:37:32,625 --> 00:37:34,625
[sentimental music continues]

666
00:37:42,791 --> 00:37:44,333
Why help you?

667
00:37:46,833 --> 00:37:48,083
'Cause you're stuck.

668
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:52,375
Nobody wants to be stuck, right?

669
00:37:56,375 --> 00:37:57,541

That…

672

That was loud. [chuckles]

673
00:38:07,666 --> 00:38:10,000
I've never understood
the whole "quiet-in-the-library" thing.

674
00:38:10,083 --> 00:38:13,125
Like, what?
Noise makes you stupid? [chuckles]

675
00:38:13,208 --> 00:38:15,083
Anyway, how are you? How's the ghost?

676
00:38:15,666 --> 00:38:17,791
Our whole street's a shitshow,
thanks to you guys.

677
00:38:17,875 --> 00:38:20,208
My dad has the tow company on speed dial.

678
00:38:20,708 --> 00:38:22,083
It's kind of bad, actually.

679
00:38:22,166 --> 00:38:23,041
Oh.

680
00:38:24,166 --> 00:38:25,416
- Sorry.
- [scoffs]

681
00:38:27,333 --> 00:38:28,541
What are you working on?

682
00:38:29,083 --> 00:38:29,958
Uh…

683
00:38:30,041 --> 00:38:31,416
Ooh. Property records?

684
00:38:31,500 --> 00:38:32,541
Uh, yeah.

685
00:38:32,625 --> 00:38:36,250
I'm trying to see if Ernest
actually lived in our house

686
00:38:36,333 --> 00:38:37,166
before he died.

687
00:38:37,250 --> 00:38:40,625
- He doesn't remember how he got there?
- He doesn't remember anything.

688
00:38:40,708 --> 00:38:42,250
[chuckles] Ooh. A mystery.

689
00:38:43,041 --> 00:38:44,666
Yeah, I'm just... Oh.

690
00:38:45,250 --> 00:38:47,000
- Okay.
- [Joy typing]

691
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:49,750
Are you, like, a hacker or something?

692
00:38:52,958 --> 00:38:54,625
Ta-da! Mystery solved.

693
00:38:55,208 --> 00:38:56,208
Ernest Scheller.

694
00:38:56,291 --> 00:38:58,875
Bought the house April 5th, 1965,

695
00:38:58,958 --> 00:39:01,416
and sold it December 15th, 1971.

696
00:39:01,500 --> 00:39:03,166
- How did he die?
- Gimme a sec.

697
00:39:06,041 --> 00:39:08,333
Oh. Weird. There's no death certificate.

698
00:39:08,916 --> 00:39:10,583
- Pretty sure he's dead.
- You think?

699
00:39:10,666 --> 00:39:12,000
[chuckles]

700
00:39:13,041 --> 00:39:16,291
[exhales] Sorry.
Looks like a dead end. Puns!

701
00:39:16,375 --> 00:39:17,208
[laughs awkwardly]

702
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:19,875
Uh, I gotta run.
Band practice. But good luck.

703
00:39:20,875 --> 00:39:21,750

{\an8}I… I don't wanna hurt your feelings
or anything, but I… I'm drawing the line.

710
00:39:49,583 --> 00:39:52,000
No more rest home readings.

711
00:39:52,083 --> 00:39:53,916
The food always sucks.

712
00:39:54,000 --> 00:39:58,208
What about Kris Jenner? Doesn't she have
someone in her family that died recently?

713
00:39:58,875 --> 00:40:00,458
Her dog? I'm not...

714
00:40:00,541 --> 00:40:02,291
- Oh. Hey. Hi.
- [Frank] Hey.

715
00:40:02,375 --> 00:40:04,083
You know, I just… I gotta go. I gotta go.

716
00:40:04,166 --> 00:40:06,541
All right. Okay.
Okay, okay. I gotta go. Hey.

717
00:40:06,625 --> 00:40:09,291
- Hey! Hello. Hey!
- Hey.

718
00:40:09,375 --> 00:40:10,750
Oh my gosh.

719
00:40:11,333 --> 00:40:13,333
- You must be Frank.
- [Frank] Yeah.

720
00:40:13,416 --> 00:40:17,375
Everyone here at TSC is just thrilled
about you and everything happening.

721
00:40:17,458 --> 00:40:20,416
Well, we're really excited
to have you in our home.

722
00:40:20,500 --> 00:40:22,291
We're huge fans of the show.

723
00:40:22,375 --> 00:40:24,125
- Aw.
- We watch the show all the time.

724
00:40:24,208 --> 00:40:26,166
You're a gem.
You're a gem. You really are.

725
00:40:27,541 --> 00:40:30,208
Oh, and you're cute!

726
00:40:30,791 --> 00:40:32,833
Nobody said you were cute!

727
00:40:33,458 --> 00:40:34,291
Nobody.

728
00:40:34,375 --> 00:40:36,250
- [laughs]
- Just wanna know, where's the wifey?

729
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,125
Uh, she's somewhere getting ready.

730
00:40:38,208 --> 00:40:39,125
Good.

731
00:40:39,875 --> 00:40:40,916
Lock her up.

732
00:40:41,833 --> 00:40:44,875
That's right. And put her in a box
under the bed because

733
00:40:44,958 --> 00:40:46,166
you're mine.

734
00:40:47,250 --> 00:40:49,500
[all laughing]

735
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:54,041
Well, can you make sure that

736
00:40:54,125 --> 00:40:56,166
"he's" ready for me?

737
00:40:57,291 --> 00:40:58,458
- Ernest!
- Yes!

738
00:40:58,541 --> 00:41:00,791
He's… he's good to go. We're ready. We…

739
00:41:00,875 --> 00:41:02,333
- We're cool.
- [Judy] Oh, good.

740
00:41:03,416 --> 00:41:05,375
[in deep voice] Because I'm ready for him.

741
00:41:06,666 --> 00:41:08,458

[screaming on TV]

743
00:41:10,750 --> 00:41:12,208
[Kevin] Oh. Look, look. See?

744
00:41:12,291 --> 00:41:13,916
[screaming on TV]

745
00:41:14,875 --> 00:41:16,791
That's the kind of vibe you gotta work.

746
00:41:16,875 --> 00:41:18,708
Intensity. Visceral.

747
00:41:19,708 --> 00:41:20,666
[exclaims]

748
00:41:21,666 --> 00:41:23,500
- Where'd he go? Make him come back.
- Who?

749
00:41:23,583 --> 00:41:25,541
Kevin, don't play around.
I know he was here.

750
00:41:25,625 --> 00:41:26,833
He's not your lapdog.

751
00:41:26,916 --> 00:41:28,208
I didn't say he...

752
00:41:28,291 --> 00:41:30,791
Look, I got Judy Romano
in my living room right now, man.

753
00:41:30,875 --> 00:41:34,125
- I don't even know who that is.
- Yo, the West Bay Medium's downstairs!

754
00:41:34,208 --> 00:41:35,208
That's who it is!

755
00:41:36,916 --> 00:41:38,375
Why can't you just ask him yourself?

756
00:41:38,458 --> 00:41:39,625
Because he likes you.

757
00:41:39,708 --> 00:41:41,291
- He listens to you.
- [knock at door]

758
00:41:41,375 --> 00:41:43,875
Sorry to interrupt,
but we're ready for you downstairs.

759
00:41:43,958 --> 00:41:46,000
I'm so sorry. Thank you for your patience.

760
00:41:46,083 --> 00:41:47,416
We'll be right down.

761
00:41:50,083 --> 00:41:52,500
Look, this is important, okay?

762
00:41:52,583 --> 00:41:55,583
Now, this show has a huge following.

763
00:41:55,666 --> 00:41:56,916
Now, if we nail this,

764
00:41:57,000 --> 00:41:59,916
I'm talking about book deals,
merchandising…

765
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:03,208
We could be the Black Kardashians.
Don't you wanna be Kim Kardashian?

766
00:42:08,291 --> 00:42:09,958
[scoffs] Okay.

767
00:42:10,750 --> 00:42:11,583
Anyway.

768
00:42:12,375 --> 00:42:13,416
[sighs]

769
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:15,041
- Fine.
- You'll talk to him?

770
00:42:15,125 --> 00:42:16,166
I'll try.

771
00:42:16,833 --> 00:42:18,750
[chuckles] My man.

772
00:42:23,750 --> 00:42:24,750
Hey, Ernest.

773
00:42:27,208 --> 00:42:28,375
Ready to have some fun?

774
00:42:33,166 --> 00:42:34,041
Are we rolling?

775
00:42:34,125 --> 00:42:35,041
Oh!

776
00:42:37,458 --> 00:42:38,541
[sucks teeth]

777
00:42:39,166 --> 00:42:40,083
There.

778
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:42,916
- Oh. So, Frank.
- [chuckles]

779
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:49,000
The entire world right now is captivated
by your interactions with Ernest.

780
00:42:49,083 --> 00:42:49,916
Yeah.

781
00:42:50,000 --> 00:42:53,458
You know, but there's
a fair amount of skepticism out there too.

782
00:42:53,541 --> 00:42:55,416
I mean, even myself. Even myself.

783
00:42:55,500 --> 00:42:56,333
I was like,

784
00:42:56,833 --> 00:42:59,333
"I don't think I believe
these videotapes," you know?

785
00:42:59,416 --> 00:43:03,916
But now that I am here,
right in this room,

786
00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,791
feeling what I'm feeling,

787
00:43:06,500 --> 00:43:09,875
I mean… [chuckles]
…it's all very palpable, isn't it, right?

788
00:43:09,958 --> 00:43:12,041
Yeah. Ernest is real.

789
00:43:12,125 --> 00:43:14,375
There's… there's no magic here.

790
00:43:14,458 --> 00:43:17,541
So… is he here now?

791
00:43:17,625 --> 00:43:21,750
[splutters] He… he… he's coming. Right?

792
00:43:21,833 --> 00:43:24,708
He's just shy, you know?
There's a lot of… a lot of people.

793
00:43:24,791 --> 00:43:25,875
Uh-huh.

794
00:43:25,958 --> 00:43:27,916
[inhales, chuckles awkwardly]

795

Frank.

797
00:43:33,666 --> 00:43:35,708
Oh. Oh. Um… [chuckles]

798
00:43:36,333 --> 00:43:37,166
Uh…

799
00:43:38,208 --> 00:43:39,291
Ernest!

800
00:43:40,750 --> 00:43:41,791
You here, man?

801
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:47,916
- [tuts] Ernest, everyone's waiting.
- [Melanie inhales]

802
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:48,833
[Kevin inaudible] No.

803
00:43:48,916 --> 00:43:51,291
Okay. Okay.

804
00:43:51,375 --> 00:43:53,291
Listen, Frank, if you could just, uh,

805
00:43:53,375 --> 00:43:56,541
fix your little hologram machine, okay,
'cause I need to get outta here.

806
00:43:56,625 --> 00:44:00,166
No, no, no. There is no hologram.
[splutters] He's…

807
00:44:01,666 --> 00:44:02,750
Ernest!

808
00:44:02,833 --> 00:44:04,375
- We're outta here.
- No, wait.

809
00:44:04,458 --> 00:44:06,458
- [Judy] We're done.
- [Frank] Stop, no. Stop, please.

810
00:44:06,541 --> 00:44:08,041
Just… just wait, please?

01:15:55,250 --> 01:15:59,041
My dad's programmed every second
of my life, and it's exhausting.

1402
01:15:59,125 --> 01:16:01,250
[scoffs] At least your dad cares.

1403
01:16:02,083 --> 01:16:03,291
It's a culture thing.

1404

We have to be the best.

1405

Prove that we belong. It's bullshit.

1406
01:16:09,708 --> 01:16:12,791
Sometimes it just seems
like he doesn't even know me.

1407
01:16:14,125 --> 01:16:17,041
He just sees this fake version of me
that he created.

1408
01:16:17,125 --> 01:16:20,041
I don't know.
I guess it's what a lot of parents do.

1409
01:16:20,875 --> 01:16:25,708
Try and fix themselves through their kids,
but they just mess 'em up more in the end.

1410
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:31,833
The sad thing is me and my dad were
actually best friends when I was a kid.

1411
01:16:33,708 --> 01:16:34,708
I miss that.

1412
01:16:36,291 --> 01:16:37,125
What happened?

1413
01:16:37,958 --> 01:16:39,833
I don't know. It…

1414
01:16:41,083 --> 01:16:45,916
It wasn't just one thing. It was, like,
a bunch of things over time, and…

1415
01:16:47,625 --> 01:16:48,708

1416

I'm not even his son anymore.

I looked high and low.

1474
01:21:17,958 --> 01:21:21,083
Ramona said I was always losing things,

1475
01:21:21,166 --> 01:21:24,916
even the damn shirt
off my own back, but, uh…

1476
01:21:26,750 --> 01:21:28,625
I knew something wasn't right.

1477
01:21:31,750 --> 01:21:33,791
I didn't see that shirt again

1478
01:21:33,875 --> 01:21:38,333
till a couple of weeks ago
when I saw one of your videos on the TV.

1479
01:21:40,041 --> 01:21:44,166
Well, I've seen
some crazy things in my life, but this…

1480
01:21:46,333 --> 01:21:49,166
I really can't believe this is real.

1481
01:21:54,875 --> 01:21:57,958
His name was Randy. Randy McGovern.

1482
01:21:58,041 --> 01:22:01,958
That woman next to him
was my wife's sister, Evelyn.

1483
01:22:02,041 --> 01:22:04,375
Dear, kind woman.

1484
01:22:04,458 --> 01:22:07,583
She died from, uh, complications in labor.

1485
01:22:07,666 --> 01:22:08,500
He had a child?

1486
01:22:09,625 --> 01:22:11,291
Daughter. June.

1487
01:22:13,250 --> 01:22:14,083
Junebug.

1488
01:22:16,208 --> 01:22:17,750
Randy, what happened to him?

1489
01:22:17,833 --> 01:22:21,208
Ramona and I never really wanted kids.

1490
01:22:21,291 --> 01:22:24,666
Just always thought we'd travel,
see the world.

1491
01:22:26,500 --> 01:22:29,458
But life had other plans for us.

1492
01:22:29,541 --> 01:22:32,958
After Evelyn died,
Randy sort of fell apart, I guess.

1493
01:22:33,541 --> 01:22:34,750
Took to drinking.

1494
01:22:36,291 --> 01:22:40,958
Then one day, he showed up
at our house with little June,

1495
01:22:41,666 --> 01:22:44,583
said he had an appointment,
needed us to watch her,

1496
01:22:45,250 --> 01:22:46,750
but he never came back.

1497
01:22:47,333 --> 01:22:50,333
Just left that poor little girl with us.
She was four.

1498
01:22:50,416 --> 01:22:53,583
Nobody ever heard from
or saw that man again.

1499
01:22:53,666 --> 01:22:56,791
Maybe something happened,
like an accident or...

1500
01:22:56,875 --> 01:23:00,833
Police found his car
for sale at a used lot,

1501
01:23:00,916 --> 01:23:04,750
uh, his watch at a pawn shop.

1502
01:23:05,333 --> 01:23:06,875
He took my shirt,

1503
01:23:07,458 --> 01:23:09,375
my driver's license.

1504
01:23:10,000 --> 01:23:12,541
Might have used that
to change his identity.

1505
01:23:14,916 --> 01:23:16,291
What do you think happened?

1506
01:23:16,375 --> 01:23:19,583
My guess, uh, drank himself to death.

1507
01:23:20,166 --> 01:23:21,541
Suicide, maybe. Who knows?

1508
01:23:21,625 --> 01:23:25,333
It's… it's hard to feel much sympathy
for somebody like that,

1509
01:23:25,416 --> 01:23:28,375
abandoning their own motherless child.

1510
01:23:28,458 --> 01:23:30,458
I can't think of a greater sin than that.

1511
01:23:30,541 --> 01:23:31,458
No.

1512
01:23:32,541 --> 01:23:34,833
No. No, no. No way.
He wouldn't do something like that.

1513
01:23:34,916 --> 01:23:37,791
You said it yourself.
He can't remember, right?

1514
01:23:39,291 --> 01:23:44,208
Maybe the reason he can't remember,
because the truth, what he did,

1515
01:23:45,083 --> 01:23:46,416
is too unbearable.

1577
01:28:06,875 --> 01:28:07,916
[people laughing]

1578
01:28:08,000 --> 01:28:11,166
Come on, just right this way.
Ah, there she is.

1579
01:28:11,958 --> 01:28:14,625
Ah, the woman of the hour.

1580
01:28:15,291 --> 01:28:17,541
Gentlemen… Oh, and lady,

1581
01:28:17,625 --> 01:28:20,666
please meet Dr. Leslie Monroe.

1582
01:28:20,750 --> 01:28:23,583
Oh, actually, I correct myself.

1583
01:28:23,666 --> 01:28:24,791
Agent Monroe.

1584
01:28:24,875 --> 01:28:29,666
She assisted us in capturing
the asset you see before you.

1585
01:28:29,750 --> 01:28:31,125
- Very good job, yes.
- [clapping]

1586
01:28:31,208 --> 01:28:32,083
[man] Bravo.

1587
01:28:32,166 --> 01:28:34,708
So, now...
No, please, please, just take a look.

1588
01:28:35,833 --> 01:28:37,708
[Schipley laughs]

1589
01:28:40,500 --> 01:28:41,708
[exhales]

1590
01:28:41,791 --> 01:28:44,083
Of course you did more than just assist.
That was just...

1591
01:28:44,166 --> 01:28:45,041
What's the endgame?

1592
01:28:46,416 --> 01:28:48,583
- [Schipley] I'm sorry, endgame?
- [Leslie] Well…

1593
01:28:51,208 --> 01:28:52,625
What are you gonna do with him?

1594
01:28:52,708 --> 01:28:55,833
Well, he's dead, so, uh…

1595
01:28:57,375 --> 01:28:58,708
whatever the hell we want.

1596
01:28:59,875 --> 01:29:01,083
[Schipley pats shoulder]

1597
01:29:01,166 --> 01:29:03,166
[wistful music playing]

1598
01:29:11,750 --> 01:29:12,833
[knocks on door]

1599
01:29:17,750 --> 01:29:19,375
[dog barking]

1600
01:29:25,458 --> 01:29:26,458
[door opens]

1601
01:29:27,833 --> 01:29:30,583
Hi, um, is Kevin around?

1602
01:29:31,791 --> 01:29:33,125
I haven't seen him at school.

1603
01:29:33,208 --> 01:29:36,250
Uh, yeah, he's just taking
a little break from stuff, honey.

1604
01:29:36,750 --> 01:29:38,208
Maybe come back another time?

1605
01:29:38,291 --> 01:29:39,666
Yeah, okay.

1606
01:29:39,750 --> 01:29:40,916
[Kevin] It's okay, Mom.

1607
01:29:44,083 --> 01:29:45,083
Hey.

1608
01:29:45,750 --> 01:29:47,875
You haven't responded to any of my texts.

1609
01:29:48,458 --> 01:29:49,541
Yeah, I…

1610
01:29:50,541 --> 01:29:54,916
I haven't really felt like
talking to anyone, so…

1611
01:29:55,000 --> 01:29:56,833
It's okay. I get it.

1612
01:30:00,833 --> 01:30:01,666
How is everything?

1613
01:30:02,291 --> 01:30:06,083
Well, I'm grounded until I'm 80,
but other than that, super peachy.

1614
01:30:08,958 --> 01:30:12,083
Um, I just… I wanted to check up on you.

1615
01:30:15,041 --> 01:30:15,958
Cool.

1616
01:30:17,458 --> 01:30:18,625
Thanks.

1617
01:30:18,708 --> 01:30:20,333
No, really though. Are you doing okay?

1618
01:30:23,166 --> 01:30:24,000
Yeah.

1619
01:30:25,916 --> 01:30:26,791
I'm fine.

1620
01:30:29,416 --> 01:30:30,458
See you around.

1621
01:30:31,833 --> 01:30:33,875
[door opens, closes]

1622
01:30:35,791 --> 01:30:37,791
[wistful music playing]

1623
01:30:38,791 --> 01:30:40,500
[thunder rumbles]

1624
01:30:53,166 --> 01:30:54,041
Hey.

1625
01:31:01,625 --> 01:31:03,250
It's so quiet up here now.

1626
01:31:09,625 --> 01:31:11,208
Feels strange. [chuckles]

1627
01:31:18,250 --> 01:31:20,583
It was raining like this
the day you were born.

1628
01:31:21,375 --> 01:31:24,583
I remember because
I was driving your mom to the hospital,

1629
01:31:25,875 --> 01:31:27,666
and traffic was so bad.

1630
01:31:29,208 --> 01:31:31,458
I thought she was gonna
give birth right there in the car.

1631
01:31:32,041 --> 01:31:33,125
I was petrified.

1632
01:31:33,208 --> 01:31:37,041
I made a promise to myself
that if we made it to the hospital…

1633
01:31:40,666 --> 01:31:42,416
I was gonna be the best dad in the world.

1634
01:31:44,916 --> 01:31:46,625
[thunder rumbling]

1635
01:31:46,708 --> 01:31:47,791
It's funny.

1636
01:31:50,625 --> 01:31:51,958
When your kids are little,

1637
01:31:53,250 --> 01:31:54,541
it's easy to be a parent.

1638
01:31:56,041 --> 01:31:59,666
They don't see who you actually are.

1639
01:32:01,583 --> 01:32:03,041
They just see the good stuff.

1640
01:32:04,208 --> 01:32:05,541
What you want them to see.

1641
01:32:07,625 --> 01:32:10,041
But eventually, as they grow up…

1642
01:32:12,000 --> 01:32:16,625
parts of yourself that you don't like
become harder and harder to hide.

1643
01:32:19,416 --> 01:32:20,375
I guess

1644
01:32:21,583 --> 01:32:24,541
I never really figured out who I am.

1645
01:32:27,833 --> 01:32:29,750
I've just always chased stuff.

1646
01:32:30,416 --> 01:32:32,250
New places, new jobs…

1647
01:32:34,458 --> 01:32:36,125
hoping something would click,

1648
01:32:37,333 --> 01:32:43,041
and I would finally be the man
I wanted to be for you and Fulton…

1649
01:32:45,833 --> 01:32:47,041
and your mom.

1650
01:32:48,000 --> 01:32:50,333
But then Ernest came, and I was like,

1651
01:32:50,875 --> 01:32:52,208
"This is it."

1652
01:32:55,625 --> 01:32:56,750
I could finally…

1653
01:32:59,375 --> 01:33:01,333
have a purpose.

1654
01:33:02,916 --> 01:33:04,458
I could finally be worthy.

1655
01:33:10,708 --> 01:33:12,333
I lost myself all over again.

1656
01:33:16,083 --> 01:33:17,291
I let you down, kid.

1657
01:33:22,708 --> 01:33:24,166
I broke my promise.

1658
01:33:24,250 --> 01:33:26,250
[wistful music playing]

1659
01:33:38,166 --> 01:33:39,666
I know you're upset about Ernest.

1660
01:33:41,125 --> 01:33:44,750
But you tried to do the right thing,
and that's all that matters.

1661
01:33:48,208 --> 01:33:51,583
You're a better man at 16

1662
01:33:52,291 --> 01:33:53,958
than I am at 45.

1663
01:33:57,041 --> 01:33:58,416
I admire you, Kevin.

1664
01:34:01,166 --> 01:34:03,416
You turned out great, in spite of me.

1665
01:34:25,458 --> 01:34:27,000
[thunder rumbling]

1666
01:34:32,583 --> 01:34:34,583

[device beeps]

1669
01:34:44,666 --> 01:34:47,208
Can you face me, please? Turn towards me.

1670
01:34:49,291 --> 01:34:50,250
[device beeps]

1671
01:34:51,041 --> 01:34:52,000
Turn around.

1672
01:34:56,250 --> 01:34:57,375
Turn around.

1673
01:35:00,750 --> 01:35:02,458
I said turn around.

1674
01:35:06,083 --> 01:35:07,083
Comply.

1675
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:15,000
Comply.

1676
01:35:17,708 --> 01:35:20,000
I said comply! [echoes]

1677
01:35:22,541 --> 01:35:23,750

01:36:45,666 --> 01:36:47,625
Yeah. Works on the living too.

[alarm blaring]

1691
01:36:54,291 --> 01:36:55,291
[inaudible] Thank you.

1692
01:36:56,083 --> 01:36:56,916
Get out of here.

[dramatic music playing]

1694
01:37:03,250 --> 01:37:05,125
- …figured it out.
- Where is our Uber?

1695
01:37:05,208 --> 01:37:06,541
It's a Lyft, stupid.

1696
01:37:06,625 --> 01:37:08,458
- You're stupid, Tara.
- Oh my God!

1697
01:37:08,541 --> 01:37:10,916
- We're gonna get mugged and die out here.
- No, no.

1698
01:37:11,000 --> 01:37:13,375
- It's gonna be fine.
- We should go to Taco Bell!

1699

- [all exclaim]
- Yes!

1700
01:37:15,666 --> 01:37:18,083
- Wait, is that it? Oh my God!
- Oh my God! Thank you!

1701
01:37:18,166 --> 01:37:19,333
Hi, hi, hi.

1702
01:37:19,416 --> 01:37:21,375
- Is this for Gabby?
- Uh-huh.

1703
01:37:22,291 --> 01:37:24,250
[girls screaming]

01:37:27,000 --> 01:37:28,041
[gasps]

1705
01:37:28,125 --> 01:37:29,875
Holy shit, man!

1706
01:37:30,625 --> 01:37:32,791
Ernest, dude!

1707
01:37:32,875 --> 01:37:35,208
Uh, excuse me. This is my Uber.

1708
01:37:35,291 --> 01:37:37,583
Uh, it's a Lyft, bitch.

1709
01:37:37,666 --> 01:37:38,958
Bye!

1710
01:37:39,458 --> 01:37:40,375
Wait!

1711
01:37:41,083 --> 01:37:42,833
Hell yeah! [laughs]

1712
01:37:42,916 --> 01:37:44,875
- So, which way you headed, Ernest?
- [siren blaring]

1713
01:37:48,458 --> 01:37:49,708
You got it.

- [ominous music playing]
- [man] I missed this house.

1724
01:39:07,125 --> 01:39:09,541
Randy, a ghost.

1725
01:39:09,625 --> 01:39:12,083
[laughs] A goddamn ghost.

1726
01:39:17,041 --> 01:39:21,625
Fifty years… I've kept this secret.

1727
01:39:23,625 --> 01:39:26,791
But the chickens
finally came home to roost.

1728
01:39:26,875 --> 01:39:28,625
I don't know anything. I swear.

1729
01:39:28,708 --> 01:39:30,833
You're lying. You came after me.

1730
01:39:30,916 --> 01:39:33,625
- I was just trying to help him.
- You're lying!

1731
01:39:34,208 --> 01:39:35,166
[Frank grunts]

1732
01:39:35,250 --> 01:39:38,166
- Frank. Did you hear that?
- Okay. All right. Yup, yup, yup.

1733
01:39:46,500 --> 01:39:47,416
Stay here.

1734
01:39:48,333 --> 01:39:49,750
- Be careful.
- All right.

1735
01:39:58,500 --> 01:40:00,500
[tense music playing]

1736
01:40:12,458 --> 01:40:14,500
- What are you doing?
- Thought I heard something!

1737
01:40:14,583 --> 01:40:16,750
Shit. [breathing heavily]

1738
01:40:16,833 --> 01:40:17,666
Me too.

1739
01:40:18,750 --> 01:40:19,583
Stay here.

1740
01:40:19,666 --> 01:40:20,541
Yeah, right.

1741
01:40:22,625 --> 01:40:23,541
Come on.

1742
01:40:25,291 --> 01:40:27,291

[ominous music playing]

1745
01:40:54,750 --> 01:40:55,666
Drop it.

1746
01:40:56,500 --> 01:40:58,041
Okay. Okay, take it easy.

1747
01:41:02,833 --> 01:41:04,250
[bat clatters]

1748
01:41:04,333 --> 01:41:05,875
Please don't hurt my son.

1749
01:41:06,458 --> 01:41:08,333
It was Ramona's idea.

1750
01:41:08,875 --> 01:41:13,041
She couldn't have kids of her own,
and when her sister died,

1751
01:41:13,125 --> 01:41:15,583
she said it was a sign from God

1752
01:41:16,166 --> 01:41:19,958
that Randy couldn't take care of June
without her mother.

1753
01:41:20,041 --> 01:41:23,666
She made me do it.
