1
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:43,114
Ooh

2
00:00:44,560 --> 00:00:47,552
Ooh

3
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:49,477
Yeah

4
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:03,195
This will be
an everlasting love

5
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:06,915
This will be
the one I've waited for

6
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:09,600
This will be
the first time anyone

7
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:12,393
Has loved me-e-e

8
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:14,238
Ooo-oh

9
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:17,591
Loving you
is some kind of wonderful

10
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:21,713
Because you've shown me
just how much you care

11
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:24,957
You've given me
the thrill of a lifetime

12
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,039
And made me believe you've
got more thrills to spare, oh

13
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,311
This will be
You and me

14
00:01:32,440 --> 00:01:35,557
Yessiree

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,318
Huggin' and squeezin'
and kissin' and pleasin'

00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:39,635
Together forever

00:01:39,760 --> 00:01:42,832
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You and me

18
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,757
So long as I'm livin'
True love I'll be givin'

19
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,189
To you I'll be servin'
'Cause you're so deservin'

20
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:50,039
Hey, you're so deservin'

21
00:01:50,160 --> 00:01:52,754
You're so deservin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah

22
00:01:52,880 --> 00:01:54,916
Ooo-oh

23
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,157
Love, love, love, love

24
00:01:58,280 --> 00:02:00,840
Love, love, love, love

25
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,669
From now on
From now on

26
00:02:04,800 --> 00:02:08,236
From now on
From now on

27
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:11,875
From now on
From now on

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:13,513
From now on

29
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:19,148
Okay, there are two things that
I remember about my childhood.

30
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:22,875
I just don't remember
it being this orange.

31
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,992
First, I remember
being with my dad.

32
00:02:26,120 --> 00:02:29,556
He would get these far-off looks
in his eye, and he would say,

33
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:33,389
"Life doesn't always turn out
the way you plan."

34
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,308
I just wish I realized at the time
he was talking about my life.

35
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:42,471
But that never stopped us from
taking our adventures together.

36
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,989
He would pack up
our sometimes-working car,

37
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:47,350
and he would tell me
amazing stories...

38
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,357
about strange
and exotic lands...

39
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:52,870
as we headed off to
exciting destinations like...

40
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,956
Milwaukee.

41
00:02:55,080 --> 00:02:58,709
It's amazing how exotic
Wisconsin... isn't.

42
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:01,229
But my favorite memories
were the stories...

43
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:03,510
that he would tell me
about my mom.

44
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:05,631
He would take me to the church
where they got married...

45
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,832
and I'd beg him to tell me more
about the ceremony...

46
00:03:08,960 --> 00:03:11,110
and about
my crazy Uncle Irwin...

47
00:03:11,240 --> 00:03:14,312
who fell asleep
in the macaroni and cheese.

48
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:16,715
And I asked my dad
when he knew...

49
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:19,593
that he truly loved my mom.

50
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:22,314
And he said to me,
"Lucy, your mother...

51
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,908
"gave me a special gift.

52
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:27,508
She gave me the world."

53
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:29,915
Actually it was a globe
with a light in it.

54
00:03:30,040 --> 00:03:33,635
But for the romantic that he was,
it might as well have been the world.

55
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:37,110
Well, the first time
I saw him,

56
00:03:37,240 --> 00:03:39,196
he didn't exactly
give me the world.

57
00:03:39,320 --> 00:03:41,788
It was a $1.50 train token.

58
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,515
Uh, but I-I looked forward to it
every single day.

59
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:48,791
He started coming to my booth
between 8:01 and 8:15...

60
00:03:48,920 --> 00:03:50,797
every morning,
Monday through Friday.

61
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:54,595
And he was just perfect.
My Prince Charming.

62
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:58,714
Well, we've nev... We've
never actually spoken.

63
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:02,799
But I know someday we will.
I know it. I just know it.

64
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:06,799
And I know that someday I will
find a way to introduce myself,

65
00:04:06,920 --> 00:04:10,037
and, and that's
gonna be perfect.

66
00:04:10,160 --> 00:04:12,310
Just like my prince.

67
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:21,557
Forty-five dollars for a Christmas tree
and they don't deliver?

68
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:26,800
You order $10 worth of chow mein from
Mr. Wong's, they bring it to your door.

69
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:30,356
Oh! Ooh, I should've gotten the
blue spruce. They're lighter.

70
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:33,672
Aah! Ooh.

71
00:04:37,320 --> 00:04:40,039
Lucy!

72
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,948
Nature of claim:
Christmas tree through window.

73
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:46,310
H-How am I gonna put that on my
insurance? They're still pissed...

74
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,591
about the fire we had when Joe
Jr. Barbecued in the stairwell.

75
00:04:49,720 --> 00:04:51,915
- I missed that one.
- Oh, great sausage.

76
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:56,272
- Look, I-I'll pay for this.
- That's okay, Lucy.

77
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,550
My brother Julie's
in the glass business.

78
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:01,911
Oh... I almost forgot.

79
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:03,996
Merry Christmas.

80
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,272
Ah, Lucy. You, you
didn't have to do that.

81
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,075
- Well, I wanted to.
- I haven't even gotten
to my shopping yet.

82
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,714
Hey, Pop. Could I give that
bottle of Blue Nun you got...

83
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:17,434
from Cousin Ornella
to my probation officer?

84
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:19,471
Do you see we've got
some company?

85
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,276
- Say hello.
- Hello, Luce.

86
00:05:25,760 --> 00:05:28,115
Nice, uh...

87
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:33,793
- sweater.
- Thank you.

88
00:05:33,920 --> 00:05:35,717
It's over there.

89
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,479
Lucy, you're a nice girl.
Joe Jr.'s still single.

90
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:48,595
Yeah, it's a shocker.

91
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,272
- What do you have?
- Oh, the usual.

92
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:58,233
- What's that?
- Mustard. Coke.

93
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,432
- Lucy! Lucy, Lucy, Lucy.
- Hi, Jerry.

94
00:06:01,560 --> 00:06:04,279
- I'm glad to find you here.
- I was hoping you'd find me in Bermuda.

95
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,197
Bermuda?
Oh, that's good.

96
00:06:06,320 --> 00:06:08,959
I am recommending you
for Employee of the Month.

97
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:11,435
The usual.

98
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,519
- Really? I didn't know there
was an employee of the month.
- Oh, yeah.

99
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:18,473
"Supervisor Jerry Wallace
nominates Lucy Moderatz...

100
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:21,034
"for Employee of the Month.

101
00:06:21,160 --> 00:06:23,594
"Lucy is never tardy,
always works holidays...

102
00:06:23,720 --> 00:06:26,075
"even if she has worked
the previous holiday.

103
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:30,079
"Just because she worked Thanksgiving,
Lucy is willing to work Christmas too"?

104
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,760
Jerry, I'm not
working Christmas.

105
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,396
- Ah, you'll get a nice plaque
with the mayor's stamp on it.
- I didn't vote.

106
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:40,114
- You get to ride on a float
St. Paddy's day.
- I hate parades.

107
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:42,993
- Did I mention extra holiday pay?
- I hate you.

108
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:45,839
Lucy.

109
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:48,713
Look, Violet is sick
and Celeste can't switch...

110
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:50,876
because she's got some
big family thing.

111
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,037
And I promised my kids
I'd be there for them this year.

112
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,436
- It stinks, Jerry.
- I know it isn't fair,
and I can't make you do it.

113
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,030
But, Lucy, you're the only one...

114
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:03,674
Without family.

115
00:07:15,480 --> 00:07:18,233
Merry Merry Christmas

116
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:23,319
Christmas everywhere

117
00:07:26,040 --> 00:07:28,474
Merry Merry Christmas

118
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:33,873
Christmas in the air

119
00:07:36,360 --> 00:07:39,158
Christmas in Chicago

120
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:41,794
New York too

121
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:43,990
Way down in New Orleans

122
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:46,953
And right here with you

123
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:49,515
Merry Merry Christmas

124
00:07:52,120 --> 00:07:55,396
- Santa Claus is comin' to town
- Come on, Richie.

125
00:07:57,400 --> 00:08:00,233
Jingle bells are ringin'

126
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,276
- Hi. Merry Christmas.
- Mistletoe's all around

127
00:08:05,960 --> 00:08:07,678
Ye... Uh...

128
00:08:14,920 --> 00:08:18,071
Nice coat.
Merry Christmas to you too.

129
00:08:18,200 --> 00:08:20,839
You're beautiful.
Will you marry me?

130
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,837
I love you.

131
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,797
- Yo!
- Hey!

132
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:29,514
- Nice coat.
- It's Christmas.

133
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,917
- Look, I don't want any trouble. Oh!
- Shit!

134
00:08:37,880 --> 00:08:39,996
Let's go! Let's go!
Let's go!

135
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:48,037
Somebody help me, please!
Sir? Sir? Sir? Are you okay?

136
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:51,357
Can, can you get up?
God, sir, this is not good.

137
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:55,994
Oh, god, mister, um,
can you...

138
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:58,873
Are you breathing?
Oh, god, you smell good!

139
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,912
Please wake up. Please.
Please. Oh, god.

140
00:09:02,040 --> 00:09:04,793
Can you wake up?
Can you hear me? Um...

141
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:08,838
Oh, god!
Wake up!

142
00:09:08,960 --> 00:09:10,837
Somebody help me please!

143
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:15,317
Mister? Mister! There's a train
coming and it's fast.

144
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:17,908
It's an express!

145
00:09:18,040 --> 00:09:19,519
Oh, god!

146
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:34,073
Hi.

147
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,437
- All right, bring him down here.
- Bring him through here.
- I need a doctor here.

148
00:09:41,560 --> 00:09:43,915
Dr. Stevens.
Dr. Jessica Stevens.

149
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:46,190
Hi, um, excuse me.
About two seconds ago, a guy...

150
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:48,675
- A man was brought in.
I-I, I don't know it.
- All right. What's his name?

151
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:51,473
- I need to know his name.
You don't know his name?
- He's right... He's right there.

152
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:54,831
- Why don't you...
- Okay. No, no, you can't go in...
- Ho, ho, you can't go in there.

153
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,996
- No, no, you,
you don't understand.
- Are you family?

154
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:58,838
- Family only.
- No, you don't understand,
'cause I was...

155
00:09:58,960 --> 00:10:00,916
You wait there.

156
00:10:02,840 --> 00:10:05,274
Okay, guys,
what do we got here?

157
00:10:07,960 --> 00:10:11,873
- Oh, I was gonna marry him.
- Get Dr. Ortiz here.

158
00:10:21,400 --> 00:10:24,551
Dr. Memrack, I.C.U. West.

159
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:27,240
- Dr. Memrack, I.C.U. West.
- Come on, come with me. Over here.

160
00:10:33,840 --> 00:10:36,832
- Let him hear your voice, hon.
- Okay.

161
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:43,837
Hi.

162
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,995
Um...

163
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,715
Everything is gonna be okay.
I know it.

164
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,196
- It's gonna be fine.
- Excuse me. Is that the woman
that saved his life?

165
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:56,788
- Yeah.
- Whoa.

166
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:00,310
It gets even better than that.
She's his fiancee.

167
00:11:05,800 --> 00:11:09,110
Excuse me, ma'am. I'm sorry,
but I need to ask you a few questions.

168
00:11:09,240 --> 00:11:12,232
- O-Okay.
- Officer, may I interrupt you?
- Oh, sure. I'll be right over there.

169
00:11:12,360 --> 00:11:13,873
Thank you. Thank you.
I'm Dr. Rubin.

170
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,116
- Hi, I'm Lucy.
- Don't tell me about passes!

171
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:20,358
- Where the hell is he?
- Dad, don't embarrass me.
- Ooh, he's so pale. My god!

172
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:22,596
- What is this?
- This is my son. How is he?
- How depressing!

173
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,554
- You can't come bursting
into this unit!
- He'll be all right, right?

174
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:29,035
- Right?
- What happened? What's going on?
- He's in a coma.

175
00:11:29,160 --> 00:11:31,390
- On Christmas day.
- Jesus!

176
00:11:31,520 --> 00:11:34,751
- His vital signs are strong.
His brain waves are good.
- Brain waves.

177
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:37,713
- I think he's gonna get through this.
- Are you a specialist?

178
00:11:37,840 --> 00:11:42,152
- How did this happen?
- Um, he was pushed from the
platform at the train station.

179
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,918
- Who's she?
- She's his fiancee.

180
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,474
- His fiancee?
- Yeah.
- Peter's fiancee?

181
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:51,636
- Peter's engaged?
- Yeah, I thought...

182
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:53,910
- No, you don't understand.
- Wait. Wait.
- Hold it.

183
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,270
- He would've told us, right?
- Now, please. Please.
- He should've told us.

184
00:11:56,400 --> 00:11:58,755
- Maybe he was busy.
- Too busy to tell his own
mother he's getting married?

185
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,793
- No, no, no, don't yell at him.
- I'm not yelling at him.
If only Jack were here.

186
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:05,070
- Grandma?
- Is she okay?

187
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:08,192
She's got a little heart problem.
She's had three attacks already.

188
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:11,790
- They weren't attacks.
They were episodes.
- Oh, geez!

189
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,311
- Nothing wrong with her hearing.
- Excuse me, Doctor.
What is she doing in here?

190
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:20,831
- Hey, buddy. She saved his life.
- You saved his life?

191
00:12:20,960 --> 00:12:24,555
- Yeah, yeah, but, l...
- I thought he was pushed off
a train platform.

192
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:28,912
- She jumped on the tracks.
- You jumped on the tracks?

193
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,634
- Yeah.
- Doctor, it's supposed
to be family only.

194
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,309
- She is family.
- She's the fiancee, you idiot!

195
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,830
- Okay, look, I-I'm sorry. You,
you, you don't understand.
- I'm awfully sorry. We haven't...

196
00:12:38,960 --> 00:12:41,599
seen him for a long time,
so we didn't know.

197
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,951
I always wanted him
to find a nice girl.

198
00:12:45,080 --> 00:12:47,799
I'm so glad he found you.

199
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:53,117
Oh, Peter.

200
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:02,672
- What... Why did you say that?
I'm not his fiancee.
- Say what?

201
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,076
- Why did you tell me that you were?
- I'm not engaged. I've never
even spoken to the guy.

202
00:13:06,200 --> 00:13:09,636
What? Well, down... downstairs you said,
you said you were gonna marry him.

203
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:12,320
Ah, geez,
I was talking to myself.

204
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:16,991
Well, next time you talk to
yourself, tell yourself you're
single and end the conversation.

205
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,192
- What am I gonna do?
- I don't know.

206
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:23,517
She held me so tight. L-l... You know,
I couldn't... I couldn't tell her.

207
00:13:23,640 --> 00:13:26,313
- I know.
- Excuse me, nurse.

208
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:28,874
- Is there a pharmacy in the hospital?
- Uh, what, what do you need?

209
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:31,195
Elsie. She wants,
uh, nitroglycerin.

210
00:13:31,320 --> 00:13:35,757
- Oh, for her heart problem?
- Problem? Problems!

211
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:39,236
You know somethin',
I think you saved her life.

212
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,751
In fact, I think you saved
the whole family. Bless you.

213
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:46,678
Why don't you come with me.
I'll take you down there.

214
00:14:10,680 --> 00:14:14,878
So, tell us how
you met Peter?

215
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:17,514
Ma, she doesn't wanna
talk about that now, okay?

216
00:14:17,640 --> 00:14:19,870
Why not? We could all
use a nice story.

217
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:22,912
- How do you know it was nice?
- Of course it was nice.
Why shouldn't it be nice?

218
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:25,554
What about that other girl? What's her
name? The one he met in the bar?

219
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:27,750
What's that got to do
with the price of eggs?

220
00:14:27,880 --> 00:14:30,394
- Ashley Bartlett Bacon.
- Ox.

221
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:34,559
All I know is she was pretty
high and mighty for someone
named after breakfast meat.

222
00:14:34,680 --> 00:14:37,035
Well, he has a nice girl now.

223
00:14:37,160 --> 00:14:39,037
So, did you... did you
steal him from Ashley?

224
00:14:39,160 --> 00:14:42,675
I bet it was love
at first sight. Right?

225
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:44,756
I have a sense
about these things.

226
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:47,189
- Elsie, let her tell it.
- She is telling it.

227
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:50,471
I bet that he picked you up
in that fancy car of his.

228
00:14:50,600 --> 00:14:53,353
What was it about him that,
you know, that first struck you?

229
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:55,550
It was his, uh, smile.

230
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:58,513
They're caps.
Six hundred bucks a tooth.

231
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:00,790
Shh.

232
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,597
Well, um...

233
00:15:03,720 --> 00:15:06,712
We saw each other,
and, um...

234
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:09,559
he, uh, smiled.

235
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:11,591
And...

236
00:15:11,720 --> 00:15:15,679
And I knew that...
my life would never be the same.

237
00:15:17,640 --> 00:15:20,108
So...

238
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:25,271
Tomorrow night, 8:00.

239
00:15:25,400 --> 00:15:27,994
What?

240
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:31,351
I got Ice Capades.
I know a guy.

241
00:15:32,600 --> 00:15:34,158
Huh.

242
00:16:41,840 --> 00:16:44,354
Hi.

243
00:16:51,800 --> 00:16:54,837
Um...
Bet you're wondering...

244
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:58,873
what I'm doing here
in the middle of the night, huh?

245
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,879
Well, I-I thought
I should introduce myself.

246
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:06,595
My name's Lucy.
Lucy Eleanor Moderatz.

247
00:17:09,080 --> 00:17:12,755
I think you should know your
family thinks we're engaged.

248
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,634
Never been engaged before.
This is all very sudden for me.

249
00:17:20,320 --> 00:17:22,231
Um...

250
00:17:22,360 --> 00:17:24,749
What, what
I really came here,

251
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,872
uh, to tell you
was that, um...

252
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,356
I didn't, I didn't mean
for this to happen.

253
00:17:31,480 --> 00:17:33,914
I, I don't know
what to do.

254
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:40,192
I mean, if, if, you were awake,
I-I wouldn't be in this mess.

255
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:43,437
Oh, god. Not that
I'm blaming you. Sorry.

256
00:17:43,560 --> 00:17:45,790
It's just that, you know,
when I was, when I was a kid,

257
00:17:45,920 --> 00:17:49,390
I always imagined
what I would...

258
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,875
be like
or where I would be...

259
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:54,230
or what I would have
when I got older.

260
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:56,157
And, you know,
it was the normal stuff.

261
00:17:56,280 --> 00:18:00,398
You know, I'd have a house
and family and things like that.

262
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:02,556
Not... You know, not that I'm,
I'm complaining or anything.

263
00:18:02,680 --> 00:18:05,069
'Cause, you know, I have,
I have, I have a cat.

264
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:07,077
I have an apartment,
um...

265
00:18:08,920 --> 00:18:12,276
Sole possession of the remote
control. That's very important.

266
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:14,868
It's just...

267
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:18,709
I never met anybody that
I could laugh with, you know?

268
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:24,510
D...

269
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:27,757
Do you believe in love
at first sight?

270
00:18:27,880 --> 00:18:31,077
Nah, I bet you don't. You're
probably too sensible for that.

271
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:36,476
Or have you ever like
seen somebody and,

272
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,718
and you knew that if only
that person really knew you...

273
00:18:40,840 --> 00:18:43,991
they would, well, of course, dump
the perfect model that they were with...

274
00:18:44,120 --> 00:18:47,396
and, and realize that you were
the one that they wanted...

275
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:49,511
to just grow old with.

276
00:18:58,600 --> 00:19:02,229
Have you ever fallen in love with
somebody you haven't even talked to?

277
00:19:06,200 --> 00:19:10,830
Have you ever been so alone you spend
the night confusing a man in a coma?

278
00:19:45,840 --> 00:19:48,149
Bryan Lynch.
Mr. Bryan Lynch,

279
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:51,033
please call
Amber Lynch at 2617.

280
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,117
Oh, my god.

281
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:05,630
Bye.

282
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,513
- Lucy!
- Hi.
- We didn't know you were here.

283
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,949
- Hi.
- Hi. Were you here all night?

284
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:15,790
You're like me.
I could always sleep anywhere.

285
00:20:15,920 --> 00:20:18,639
And believe me, she has.

286
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:20,751
Wait to go, Gram!

287
00:20:20,880 --> 00:20:24,350
- So, how's Peter?
- Oh, well, he's got more color.

288
00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:27,836
- He has some color.
Looks like he has some color.
- Yeah.

289
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:30,599
Well, I, I have to go, so it
was great to see you guys again.

290
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:33,109
- Tell her. Go on, tell her.
- Yeah.

291
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:36,789
We didn't get to, uh,
celebrate Christmas, so, uh,

292
00:20:36,920 --> 00:20:39,229
it would be nice
if you could join us.

293
00:20:39,360 --> 00:20:43,638
Oh, um... Oh, I-I-I would
love to, but I, I can't.

294
00:20:43,760 --> 00:20:47,594
- Jack's gonna be there.
- That's right.
You haven't met Jack yet.

295
00:20:47,720 --> 00:20:51,998
- No, not yet.
- Oh, he'll be so happy to meet you.

296
00:20:52,120 --> 00:20:54,759
- So you'll come tonight?
- I, I, I really shouldn't
because I have to work.

297
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:57,997
- I can't.
- Well, look here. Put your phone
number and address down there.

298
00:20:58,120 --> 00:21:01,396
- Midge'll call you
and talk you into it.
- Okay.

299
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,511
And here's another card
for when you change your mind.

300
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:05,471
We're in the estate
furniture business.

301
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:08,797
We buy furniture
from dead people.

302
00:21:08,920 --> 00:21:11,559
Okay. All right, well
I have, I have it.

303
00:21:11,680 --> 00:21:14,638
- So, bye. Bye.
- Bye, dear. See you later.

304
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:16,591
Bye.

305
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:19,917
- Ma'am? Excuse me, ma'am.
- What? What is this?

306
00:21:20,040 --> 00:21:22,031
I'm sorry, Mrs. Callaghan.
These are your husband's things.

307
00:21:22,160 --> 00:21:25,914
- He's not my husband!
- I'm sorry. Your fiancee.

308
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:32,151
Uh, you're Peter's fiancee?

309
00:21:34,480 --> 00:21:36,516
- Okay.
- Dalton Clark.

310
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:39,552
Colleague of Peter's at Lubel,
Parker, Jacobs and Fink.

311
00:21:39,680 --> 00:21:42,513
- I have to go now.
- Oh, he's a great guy.

312
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:45,677
He's had a tough year. What,
with the accident last month and all.

313
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:50,434
- Accident?
- Well, of course it was an accident?

314
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:53,677
I mean, it wasn't my...
Did he tell you it was my fault?

315
00:21:53,800 --> 00:21:56,234
We're playing basketball,
all right? I carry a pencil!

316
00:21:56,360 --> 00:21:58,510
- I'm a lawyer! I do that!
- Okay.

317
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:02,076
- Jesus, what's he telling...
- It's gonna be okay.

318
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:04,509
- So what's the big deal?
- What's the big deal?

319
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:07,108
Jerry, they think I'm their
future daughter-in-law.

320
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:09,959
And the grandmother,
then she's got this heart thing.
And if I tell her the truth,

321
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:12,753
she's gonna have a heart attack,
and she's gonna die,
and it's gonna be on my head.

322
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:14,836
Well, then, go along with it.

323
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,030
And when Peter comes
out of the coma,

324
00:22:17,160 --> 00:22:20,436
the family'll be so happy
they won't care that you lied to them.

325
00:22:20,560 --> 00:22:23,393
They'll probably even
thank you for it.

326
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:26,193
Just mustard!

327
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:29,710
- Okay. What if he doesn't
come out of his coma?
- Well, then who's to know?

328
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:32,718
- I don't know. Oh, no.
- Ah. Look, look, Lucy.

329
00:22:32,840 --> 00:22:36,992
When my mother found out I
was getting married to my wife,
her intestines exploded.

330
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:38,917
- Now, you tell them now...
- Oh, my god.

331
00:22:39,040 --> 00:22:41,793
- Huh, you might as well shoot Grandma.
- Oh!

332
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:46,675
Come on, Mel.

333
00:22:46,800 --> 00:22:48,597
Mel.

334
00:23:43,800 --> 00:23:45,950
What am I doing?

335
00:23:46,080 --> 00:23:48,674
- Lucy!
- Hi, Saul, hi.

336
00:23:48,800 --> 00:23:51,109
- You made it, huh?
- Yeah.

337
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,629
- How you feel?
- Okay. Okay.

338
00:23:53,760 --> 00:23:56,433
Come on, keep me company for a while.
I don't like to smoke in the house.

339
00:23:56,560 --> 00:23:59,358
- Okay. I'm trying to quit.
- Listen... You want one?

340
00:23:59,480 --> 00:24:02,040
That's good.
Here, sit down.

341
00:24:04,040 --> 00:24:07,715
- They don't bother you, do they?
- Uh, no, no, I'm fine.

342
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:10,274
Did you know that
I was Peter's godfather?

343
00:24:10,400 --> 00:24:12,960
Really? I-I thought you
had to be Catholic for that.

344
00:24:13,080 --> 00:24:14,672
- Ox fudged it over.
- Oh.

345
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:18,793
He donated 50 folding chairs
to Father Shea's bingo night.

346
00:24:18,920 --> 00:24:21,753
You know, being a godfather
is very important to Catholics.

347
00:24:21,880 --> 00:24:24,678
It means you're practically
part of the family.

348
00:24:24,800 --> 00:24:27,917
Well, you're lucky.
It's really important...

349
00:24:28,040 --> 00:24:31,237
to have family around
this time of year.

350
00:24:31,360 --> 00:24:34,989
Are you, uh... I mean,
are your parents with you?

351
00:24:35,120 --> 00:24:37,475
No, no. My, my mom died
when I was really young...

352
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,909
and, uh, a couple of years ago,
my dad got sick...

353
00:24:40,040 --> 00:24:43,794
and, uh, we moved from Indiana
to Chicago so he could
go to a research hospital.

354
00:24:43,920 --> 00:24:48,038
Research. A medical term
for very expensive, huh?

355
00:24:48,160 --> 00:24:50,196
Yeah. Yeah, exactly.

356
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:53,312
I-I-I had to quit school and
I started working for the C.T.A.

357
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:55,271
And, um, about a year ago,

358
00:24:55,400 --> 00:25:00,554
he decided he had had enough
research, and he passed away.

359
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:05,629
- My wife of 51 years passed away
two years ago, February the 9.
- I'm sorry.

360
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:07,716
- Yeah, it was a rough time for me.
- Yeah.

361
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,035
But Ox got me through.

362
00:25:10,160 --> 00:25:12,754
- You're good friends?
- The best!

363
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:18,070
Lucy, the Callaghans,

364
00:25:18,200 --> 00:25:21,636
well, they took me in
as part of their family.

365
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:23,830
I'd never let anyone hurt them.

366
00:25:25,800 --> 00:25:27,631
Neither would I.

367
00:25:29,400 --> 00:25:31,231
I believe you wouldn't.

368
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:34,272
Lucy? You came?

369
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,231
Hi, Saul. Oh, this is great!

370
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,592
Hey, come on in, you two. It's freezin'
out here. Elsie made her eggnog.

371
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,473
- Word to the wise: Drink soda.
- Okay.

372
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:46,831
Ox, Mom, look who's here.
Lucy came!

373
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:50,191
- Oh, my!
- Hi. Hi, Mary.
- It's gonna be like Christmas.

374
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:53,312
- Come on in. It's cold out there.
- These are for you.
- Oh, sweetheart, thank you.

375
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:58,594
- We've got the most wonderful dinner.
- It smells so good. Hi.

376
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:00,790
This is so beautiful.

377
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:09,396
- That's Peter on the right.
- He's so sweet.

378
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,080
- Oh, yeah, the squirrels.
- Eggnog everyone.

379
00:26:13,640 --> 00:26:15,517
Ma, where are you?
I'm serving your eggnog.

380
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:17,551
I'm getting my camera.

381
00:26:17,680 --> 00:26:21,389
- Come on, everybody.
Get close to the tree.
- Oh, Christmas pictures.

382
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:23,636
- Lucy, come on.
- Come on, Lucy.
- Come on, let's go. Let's go.

383
00:26:23,760 --> 00:26:25,990
I-I don't want... l-l...

384
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:29,796
Watch the birdie.

385
00:26:29,920 --> 00:26:32,957
- Oh, Ma, take it again. I blinked.
- Well, you're lucky. I'm blind.

386
00:26:34,880 --> 00:26:36,757
- Oh, yeah. I love it.
- Oh. Excuse me.

387
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,474
- I don't drink anymore.
- Oh.

388
00:26:39,600 --> 00:26:42,273
I don't drink any less either.

389
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:45,119
- Perhaps I should.
- You got me. You got me.

390
00:26:45,240 --> 00:26:47,959
- Oh, look at this.
- Oh, more presents.
Okay, I'll take these two.

391
00:26:48,080 --> 00:26:50,548
- What is this?
- Whoopsie, whoopsie.
- Open it.

392
00:26:50,680 --> 00:26:52,352
- What is that?
- Turn 'em over.

393
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:55,074
- Pierced? Really?
- Mm-hmm.

394
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,112
- Oh, my god! Thank you. Thank you.
- We'll go to Walmart on Monday.

395
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,471
Don't thank me. If it was up to me,
I would've gotten you a Barbie.

396
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:03,955
- Oh, did you like that?
- More presents. Oh, boy.
- Isn't that wonderful?

397
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,719
- We hit the jackpot.
- Ma, this is for you.
- Thanks, dear.

398
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:08,876
- A present.
- Oh. "To Ox from Uncle Al."

399
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:12,515
- Who the hell is Uncle Al?
- Uncle Al. You know,
Uncle Al from Buffalo.

400
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,200
- You remember Al.
- Remember, Ma? You remember Al.
- To Lucy from Santa.

401
00:27:15,320 --> 00:27:17,788
Remember Al?
He was here the night...

402
00:27:17,920 --> 00:27:21,117
Once again as in olden days

403
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:25,233
- Happy golden days of yore
- Seven bow ties, I bet.

404
00:27:25,360 --> 00:27:26,713
- Aw, you shouldn't have.
- She made these.

405
00:27:26,840 --> 00:27:29,354
Faithful friends
who are dear to us

406
00:27:29,480 --> 00:27:31,994
Will be near to us
once more

407
00:27:32,120 --> 00:27:36,796
- Oh, the gold watch! I love it!
- Someday soon we all be together

408
00:27:36,920 --> 00:27:39,275
- Oh, sweetheart, it's so expensive.
- Hey, from Louie.
I got another bow tie.

409
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:42,597
- If the fates allow
- Oh, Gram, these are so great.
Thank you.

410
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:45,837
- Until then we'll have
to muddle through
- Hey.

411
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:49,077
- Somehow
- So pretty.

412
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:51,077
- So have yourself
- You remember Uncle Al, don't you?

413
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:53,919
- Yeah, yeah.
- A merry little Christmas now

414
00:27:54,040 --> 00:27:56,235
- I never really got him anything.
- He had a little moustache.

415
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:58,316
- He was Daddy's friend, right?
- Yeah. Yeah!

416
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:00,908
- I know an Uncle Ed.
- No, Uncle Al.

417
00:28:04,640 --> 00:28:06,437
This is Callaghan.
Leave a message...

418
00:28:06,560 --> 00:28:09,120
and I'll get back to you.
Ciao.

419
00:28:09,240 --> 00:28:12,516
Hi, it's Ashley. Ah,
Lisbon is absolutely gorgeous.

420
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:17,430
But I'm cutting my trip short because I
have been doing a lot of thinking, and...

421
00:28:17,560 --> 00:28:20,472
What the hey?
I will marry you.

422
00:28:49,640 --> 00:28:53,872
- Jack! Hey, buddy! Whoa!
- Hey.

423
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,958
Shh. Jack.
Don't wake Lucy.

424
00:28:57,080 --> 00:29:00,789
Who... Who's Lucy?

425
00:29:01,880 --> 00:29:04,314
Lucy's Peter's fiancee.

426
00:29:04,440 --> 00:29:06,749
No, that's not
Peter's fiancee.

427
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:09,917
- You haven't met her?
- No.

428
00:29:10,040 --> 00:29:13,112
Well, she's great.
You're gonna love her.

429
00:29:13,240 --> 00:29:16,516
You know what, kid,
maybe I'll stay the night.

430
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:19,598
- Don't eat my cereal in the morning.
- Oh, so it's Mary's special cereal?

431
00:29:19,720 --> 00:29:22,280
The last time you took
the toy surprise, remember?

432
00:29:50,400 --> 00:29:52,994
- Good morning.
- Oh, god.

433
00:29:53,120 --> 00:29:55,680
Oh. Oh, you scared me.

434
00:29:55,800 --> 00:29:59,679
- Sorry.
- Um, good morning, Jack.

435
00:29:59,800 --> 00:30:03,190
Um, I guess I don't
remember meeting you.

436
00:30:03,320 --> 00:30:07,074
Well, it's probably because
we've never met.

437
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,351
That might have something
to do with it.

438
00:30:13,520 --> 00:30:15,590
Ooh. Cab.
I have to go.

439
00:30:15,720 --> 00:30:18,359
I'm really... I'm really late
'cause I have to go.

440
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:21,950
But, um, l... It was nice
to meet you, Jack. So, good-bye.

441
00:30:23,960 --> 00:30:27,236
- Lucy.
- Okay, look, I-I know that l...

442
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:30,193
- Hey.
- Hmm?

443
00:30:30,320 --> 00:30:33,278
Welcome to the family.

444
00:30:33,400 --> 00:30:35,516
Oh, thank you.

445
00:30:37,280 --> 00:30:39,794
Bye.

446
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:46,157
We pray that the Lord's
healing presence...

447
00:30:46,280 --> 00:30:50,273
will be felt by those who
are sick, and by their families.

448
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:53,949
Especially Jo-Jo Goreki,
Peter Callaghan,

449
00:30:54,080 --> 00:30:56,389
Craig Little
and Peggy Dunne.

450
00:30:57,520 --> 00:30:59,829
We pray to the Lord. Lord...

451
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:01,712
Lord, hear our prayer.

452
00:31:01,840 --> 00:31:05,196
O God, You call us to live
as one family.

453
00:31:05,320 --> 00:31:08,471
- So, who's this Lucy?
- Save us from the mere,
pragmatic views of today.

454
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:11,831
- She's your brother's fiancee.
- That we may be the proof
of Your gentleness.

455
00:31:11,960 --> 00:31:14,155
You'd think if Peter
were getting married,

456
00:31:14,280 --> 00:31:16,510
- We ask this through Christ our Lord.
- He would have announced it
in the Tribune.

457
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:19,916
- We read the Sun Times. Amen.
- Amen.

458
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,430
- So why did she sneak out this morning?
- She has a job.

459
00:31:23,560 --> 00:31:25,471
I like Mass better in Latin.

460
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:28,910
It's nicer when you don't
know what they're saying.

461
00:31:29,040 --> 00:31:31,634
- Did you get the Bourbeau estate?
- Got it.

462
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:33,637
- What about Downey's?
- Got it.

463
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:35,478
- Himmelstein's?
- Yeah.

464
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:38,797
- Did you get Van Allan?
- Himmelstein's took too long.

465
00:31:38,920 --> 00:31:41,718
- Aah, for Christ's sake, Jack.
- Stop swearing!

466
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:45,310
- Look, you're runnin' the business now.
- There's something I'd like
to talk to you about.

467
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:49,115
- Talk about that later, okay?
- Talk about it now.
He can't kill you in church.

468
00:31:49,240 --> 00:31:52,710
- Will you please pipe down?
- Hey, be nice, pally. We're in church.
- Hey.

469
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:55,308
- You're disrupting the Mass!
- Who made you the Pope?

470
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:59,353
- Ox!
- How did Joe Kelly get to be a lector?

471
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,631
- He takes marijuana.
- Amen.

472
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:40,075
- Hi, Luce.
- Hi, Lucy.

473
00:32:40,200 --> 00:32:41,997
Hi, Lucy.

474
00:32:58,120 --> 00:33:00,236
Come on,
you stupid wing nut!

475
00:33:00,360 --> 00:33:02,191
Oh, your mother's...

476
00:33:14,920 --> 00:33:18,071
Excuse me?
Do you live here?

477
00:33:18,200 --> 00:33:21,909
Live here?
I own this place.

478
00:33:22,040 --> 00:33:24,349
Oh, great. Um...

479
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:27,552
Well, then you would know
the woman that lives in 201.

480
00:33:27,680 --> 00:33:30,513
Know her?
I'm dating her.

481
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,197
Hmm.

482
00:34:08,400 --> 00:34:10,197
Very clean.

483
00:34:12,160 --> 00:34:13,957
Kitty?

484
00:34:16,920 --> 00:34:19,878
Kitty?
Rich kitty?

485
00:34:20,960 --> 00:34:23,428
Come here, mealtime.

486
00:34:23,560 --> 00:34:27,348
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

487
00:34:29,320 --> 00:34:31,436
Kitty?

488
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:37,192
Kitty? Food.

489
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:40,198
Kitty, kitty, kitty, kitty.

490
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:42,276
Come here.

491
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:44,436
Come here.
Come on, honey.

492
00:34:44,560 --> 00:34:47,233
Where are you...

493
00:34:50,520 --> 00:34:53,318
Oh, I'm so sorry.

494
00:34:53,440 --> 00:34:55,635
- Nice shot.
- Oh, um...

495
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:00,910
I'll get you some ice.
I'm sorry. I wasn't expecting anybody.

496
00:35:01,040 --> 00:35:04,077
- Hey, how'd you get in here?
- Um... Oh.

497
00:35:04,200 --> 00:35:06,714
Uh... key?

498
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,637
Key? Oh, you stay here
a lot, huh?

499
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:11,718
Oh, you know, feed the cat.

500
00:35:11,840 --> 00:35:14,115
Peter doesn't have a cat.

501
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:22,080
Ohh.

502
00:35:22,200 --> 00:35:27,399
Hello. Hello, honey.
Fluffy!

503
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:29,351
Hello, Fluffy.

504
00:35:29,480 --> 00:35:31,789
You must be so hungry.

505
00:35:33,360 --> 00:35:34,998
Mm.

506
00:35:35,120 --> 00:35:37,793
Are you gonna get that?

507
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:41,959
Uh, no, I'm, I'm gonna
let the machine get it.

508
00:35:45,480 --> 00:35:47,436
Hello?

509
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:53,155
It's for you.

510
00:36:00,680 --> 00:36:02,750
Hello.

511
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:06,916
Okay. Bye-bye.

512
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:11,074
Um, that was the hospital.
They say it's customary...

513
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:13,794
for friends and family
to come down and give blood.

514
00:36:15,120 --> 00:36:17,315
Let's go together.

515
00:36:21,920 --> 00:36:24,150
You know what? I think maybe
we should take your truck.

516
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:27,238
Oh, no. We oughta take
Peter's car.

517
00:36:27,360 --> 00:36:30,193
- Okay.
- You know where it's parked, don't you?

518
00:36:30,320 --> 00:36:32,629
Oh, yeah, I, uh...
Yeah.

519
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:37,557
- Hmm.
- Hmm.

520
00:36:40,080 --> 00:36:43,072
Hey, we'll have to get
your picture for the mantle.

521
00:36:43,200 --> 00:36:45,395
- Of, of me?
- No, of you and Peter.

522
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,399
- I'm, I'm not that photogenic.
- I doubt that.

523
00:36:49,520 --> 00:36:52,796
All right. Now, I want you to sit here
and sip this, or you'll get woozy.

524
00:36:52,920 --> 00:36:55,912
- When did you start seeing Peter?
- September 17th.

525
00:36:57,680 --> 00:37:01,389
- Three months. That's quick.
- You have no idea.

526
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:04,796
- That's fast. That's a fast engagement.
- Miss!
- I'm fine.

527
00:37:04,920 --> 00:37:07,992
- Wait, I'm not finished with you!
- Oh, I got it. I got it.
I got it.

528
00:37:09,400 --> 00:37:11,197
Ooh.

529
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:16,078
What the hell he's got a TV for?
He's in a coma, for Christ's sake!

530
00:37:16,200 --> 00:37:18,714
Ox, shh. He might
hear you, you know.

531
00:37:18,840 --> 00:37:20,671
Then get him a radio.

532
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:25,191
- Maybe he'd like us to sing to him.
- Maybe Lucy knows his favorite song.

533
00:37:25,320 --> 00:37:26,992
- "Puff, the Magic Dragon."
- "Dragon."

534
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,475
- Oh.
- "Dragon."
- Huh?

535
00:37:29,600 --> 00:37:34,390
- Which one of the Three Stooges
was Peter's favorite?
- Curley.

536
00:37:34,520 --> 00:37:36,397
Curley! Hah!

537
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:41,033
- He's everybody's favorite.
- No, I like Shemp.

538
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,515
- Favorite ice cream.
- Baskin-Robbins.

539
00:37:43,640 --> 00:37:46,473
- Favorite baseball team.
- Chicago.

540
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:50,354
- Cubs or White Sox?
- What the heck is going on?

541
00:37:50,480 --> 00:37:53,358
Why are you asking her
all these questions?

542
00:37:53,480 --> 00:37:55,710
Don't ask me,
ask her boyfriend.

543
00:37:57,360 --> 00:37:58,873
That isn't very funny,
you know.

544
00:37:59,000 --> 00:38:01,230
- No, no, not this boyfriend.
- He's...

545
00:38:01,360 --> 00:38:03,396
Joe Fusco.

546
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:05,112
Joe... Joe Jr.

547
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:08,949
Mm-hmm, that's right.
Mr. Joe Fusco, Jr.

548
00:38:09,080 --> 00:38:10,752
He said that
you were intimate.

549
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:14,077
Yeah, well, he also said he invented
aluminum foil. He's delusional.

550
00:38:14,200 --> 00:38:15,838
He was very lucid
when I talked to him.

551
00:38:15,960 --> 00:38:17,916
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

552
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,315
- Ma, you okay?
- You see what you did?

553
00:38:20,440 --> 00:38:25,753
- What did I do?
- Now, if she wanted
to prove it, she'd prove it.

554
00:38:37,920 --> 00:38:40,992
Peter has one testicle.

555
00:38:44,440 --> 00:38:45,839
- No way.
- Way.

556
00:38:45,960 --> 00:38:48,349
About a month ago
there was an accident...

557
00:38:48,480 --> 00:38:53,634
and he was playing basketball and his
friend had a pencil in his back pocket.

558
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:55,034
Eww!

559
00:38:59,080 --> 00:39:00,877
Maybe, um...

560
00:39:01,000 --> 00:39:02,911
No.

561
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:05,474
- Oh, no!
- Well, somebody's gotta look.

562
00:39:05,600 --> 00:39:07,079
Don't look at me.

563
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:09,634
- No.
- Yeah, maybe, uh...

564
00:39:09,760 --> 00:39:11,398
It's not...
It's not my, uh, uh...

565
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,432
Okay, I'm his mother.

566
00:39:14,560 --> 00:39:16,152
Oh, Mom! Eww!

567
00:39:33,040 --> 00:39:34,837
Well, look at
the bright side.

568
00:39:34,960 --> 00:39:37,155
He's got more room
in his Jockey shorts.

569
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:40,960
Ma!

570
00:39:49,880 --> 00:39:51,871
- Who is it?
- What gives?

571
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:58,114
- You stood me up.
- For what?

572
00:39:58,240 --> 00:39:59,878
- Our date.
- What date?

573
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,116
To the Ice Capades.
I had to eat your ticket.

574
00:40:02,240 --> 00:40:03,958
I never said I would
go on a date with you.

575
00:40:04,080 --> 00:40:06,116
- Yes you did. Yes you did!
- No, I didn't. No, I didn't!

576
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:08,515
- Did too! Did! Did!
- Didn't! Didn't! Didn't!

577
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:10,756
- Who is it?
- Lucy, it's Saul.

578
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:12,996
- Oh, my god.
- What, are ya two-timin' Joe, Jr.?

579
00:40:13,120 --> 00:40:14,553
I'm not two-timing.
I never one-timed.

580
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,830
- Hey, I'll fight the guy.
- Hey, get in the closet.

581
00:40:18,200 --> 00:40:20,270
- Not a word.
- Nice panties.

582
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:27,593
Hey.

583
00:40:27,720 --> 00:40:30,109
I like boxer shorts, but,
uh, I'll try these, eh...

584
00:40:31,640 --> 00:40:33,551
- Sorry.
- Have you got company?

585
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:36,990
- No. TV. It's on... next door.
- Oh.

586
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,999
Um... you, uh, want some coffee
or tea or something?

587
00:40:41,120 --> 00:40:43,554
No, no.
Not a... Not a thing.

588
00:40:43,680 --> 00:40:47,355
- Lucy, there's something
you should know.
- What?

589
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:50,119
Well, the night you visited
Peter, I was outside the door.

590
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,037
I know the truth.

591
00:40:56,520 --> 00:41:00,229
Sorry, Saul. You now, you do...
You don't have to worry, 'cause
I'm gonna tell them everything.

592
00:41:00,360 --> 00:41:02,669
Don't tell them a thing.

593
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:08,077
Remember the day you said you'd... you'd
never do anything to hurt the family?

594
00:41:08,200 --> 00:41:12,239
- Yeah?
- Well, since they met you,
they figure they have Peter back.

595
00:41:12,360 --> 00:41:16,433
Now, if you tell them the truth,
eh, it'll take him away again.

596
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,439
They need you, Lucy.
Just like you need them.

597
00:41:22,400 --> 00:41:24,755
Now, look,
I know you're a good girl.

598
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:26,632
And I know you'll do
the right thing.

599
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:29,035
- Thank you.
- Yeah. Yes, you will.

600
00:41:32,840 --> 00:41:35,832
Oh-Oh, oh, by the way,
how did you know about the...

601
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:37,791
Peter with the one, uh...

602
00:41:37,920 --> 00:41:39,399
Ahh...

603
00:41:39,520 --> 00:41:42,239
You know something?
I don't wanna know.

604
00:41:45,000 --> 00:41:47,514
- Bye.
- Ooh!

605
00:41:47,640 --> 00:41:50,677
- Oh, god! What're you... What...
- Aah!

606
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,633
- What are you doing?
- I slipped.

607
00:41:53,760 --> 00:41:55,990
You're trying on my shoes?

608
00:41:56,120 --> 00:42:00,033
No! When I fell, my foot went
like that, right into the shoe.

609
00:42:00,160 --> 00:42:02,913
- Who is it?
- It's me, Jack Callaghan.

610
00:42:03,040 --> 00:42:05,508
- My god, doesn't anybody
use a phone anymore?
- I do.

611
00:42:05,640 --> 00:42:08,200
I'm not talking
about 900 numbers.

612
00:42:08,320 --> 00:42:09,958
Who told?

613
00:42:15,320 --> 00:42:18,278
Hi. So, more questions?

614
00:42:18,400 --> 00:42:20,072
No, I have an engagement present
for you.

615
00:42:22,120 --> 00:42:23,838
Uh, you really
shouldn't have.

616
00:42:23,960 --> 00:42:25,791
I didn't.
It's from my parents.

617
00:42:25,920 --> 00:42:27,353
Oh.

618
00:42:27,480 --> 00:42:29,789
It's furniture.
You want me to bring it up?

619
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:33,390
Hey, was that Saul
I saw leaving?

620
00:42:33,520 --> 00:42:35,476
What's that?

621
00:42:35,600 --> 00:42:38,194
- Cat.
- Big cat.

622
00:42:38,320 --> 00:42:40,880
Um, I th... I think y...
I think you should, um,

623
00:42:41,000 --> 00:42:43,912
bring it to, uh, t...
bring it to Peter's apartment.

624
00:42:44,040 --> 00:42:45,792
- You don't know what it is.
- Well, you know,

625
00:42:45,920 --> 00:42:49,117
anything would look nicer
in Peter's apartment.

626
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:51,674
You know what?
I'll come with you.

627
00:42:51,800 --> 00:42:53,518
Ooh!

628
00:43:15,880 --> 00:43:18,030
You know what?
I think you parked too clo...

629
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:23,476
You know, I think you parked
too close to the other car.

630
00:43:23,600 --> 00:43:25,750
Had to. We gotta
unload the furniture.

631
00:43:25,880 --> 00:43:27,359
Ready for your surprise?

632
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:33,516
Oh, that is great.

633
00:43:33,640 --> 00:43:36,871
That is so great.

634
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,911
- You like that?
- Yeah.

635
00:43:39,040 --> 00:43:42,589
Too bad. Ox bought you
the love seat.

636
00:43:42,720 --> 00:43:46,429
- Oh, I'm sorry.
- Don't be. I made this.

637
00:43:46,560 --> 00:43:50,075
- This? No, you didn't.
- Shocking, isn't it?

638
00:43:50,200 --> 00:43:52,760
- Can I sit in it?
- Rock out.

639
00:43:57,640 --> 00:44:02,270
My god, this is perfect. You should
go into business or something.

640
00:44:02,400 --> 00:44:04,994
Well, then it gets tricky.

641
00:44:05,120 --> 00:44:08,510
Oh, yeah, working with your dad
and everything, right?

642
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:10,756
The business used to be called
Callaghan and Sons,

643
00:44:10,880 --> 00:44:14,429
and then when Peter went off to
law school it became Callaghan and Son.

644
00:44:14,560 --> 00:44:18,189
If I were to leave,
it'd just be Callaghan.

645
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:26,594
- Let's take a second here
and unlock the doors off...
- No-No, I got it, I got it.

646
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:28,950
- Oh.
- See? Here we go.

647
00:44:29,080 --> 00:44:30,752
Oh, this technique.

648
00:44:30,880 --> 00:44:35,032
It's always very, very,
very modern technique this way.

649
00:44:35,160 --> 00:44:36,878
E-Excuse me, uh, sir,
what apartment?

650
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:38,399
Uh, 57G.

651
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,033
Well, sir, I'm sorry, but guests
have to be announced, ya know?

652
00:44:43,160 --> 00:44:45,116
Well, I'm with her.
I'm helping her.

653
00:44:47,040 --> 00:44:49,031
- So?
- You don't know her?

654
00:44:50,440 --> 00:44:52,237
No.

655
00:44:54,200 --> 00:44:55,713
Bu-But I'm new here.

656
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:59,594
Oh, well, she's Peter
Callaghan's fiancee in 57G.

657
00:44:59,720 --> 00:45:01,995
Ohh! Oh, yeah.

658
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:08,392
They told me about her, sir.
She's scary.

659
00:45:08,520 --> 00:45:09,839
Tell me about it.

660
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,471
- Ooh!
- Be careful.

661
00:45:15,600 --> 00:45:18,751
Uh, maybe we should, uh,
angle it a little bit.

662
00:45:18,880 --> 00:45:21,633
Um... I think it's wedged.

663
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,433
Why don't you step back for a little
bit? I'm gonna try an old trick.

664
00:45:25,640 --> 00:45:26,993
What's-What's the trick?

665
00:45:27,120 --> 00:45:30,430
- Push it really hard.
- 'Kay.

666
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:35,231
- Okay, okay, push.
- I did.

667
00:45:37,840 --> 00:45:39,831
Do you want me
to help you now?

668
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:41,632
- All right, a little help
would be good.
- 'Kay.

669
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,073
'Kay. One, two, three-yah!

670
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:49,758
Ow! Ooh!

671
00:45:53,640 --> 00:45:55,437
Ooh.

672
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:59,388
I think the sofa
should go right there.

673
00:46:03,880 --> 00:46:06,599
Oh, no!
No, no, no, look at this!

674
00:46:06,720 --> 00:46:08,870
Idiot just blocked me in.

675
00:46:09,000 --> 00:46:11,594
But I told you
not to park that close.

676
00:46:11,720 --> 00:46:13,551
Aaah!

677
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:15,398
Hey, check the meter.
See what time it is.

678
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,078
Um, it's six o'clock.

679
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,919
They can pretty much stay here
all night if they wanted to.

680
00:46:20,040 --> 00:46:21,234
All night, huh?

681
00:46:21,360 --> 00:46:24,318
Um, good night.

682
00:46:24,440 --> 00:46:26,670
You just gonna leave me
here with the truck?

683
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:27,949
Basically, yeah.

684
00:46:28,080 --> 00:46:30,036
Well, maybe I oughta
walk you back.

685
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:31,559
What for?

686
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:32,908
For protection.

687
00:46:33,040 --> 00:46:35,031
Oh, no, I'm fine.
I'm okay.

688
00:46:35,160 --> 00:46:37,390
For me. I don't want
to be here by myself.

689
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:39,317
This is Chicago.

690
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:49,558
- You look cold.
- Hmm?

691
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:51,352
- You look cold.
- Wha...

692
00:46:51,480 --> 00:46:53,789
Probably because I am cold.

693
00:46:53,920 --> 00:46:55,797
- How about you?
- This jacket's reversible.

694
00:46:55,920 --> 00:46:58,832
- I'm wearing the warm side now.
- Oh, I see!

695
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:01,558
You need a better coat.

696
00:47:01,680 --> 00:47:03,796
What? This was my dad's.

697
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,876
Ahh, then he's
probably freezing.

698
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:08,116
He passed away.

699
00:47:08,240 --> 00:47:11,152
- Sorry.
- It's not your fault.

700
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,077
Passed away last year.

701
00:47:13,200 --> 00:47:16,078
I don't even
remember my mom, so...

702
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:17,679
What was he like?

703
00:47:17,800 --> 00:47:21,395
He was a lot like me.
Dark hair, flat chest.

704
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:23,915
What do you remember
most about him?

705
00:47:24,040 --> 00:47:25,758
Oh-ho, that. Okay.

706
00:47:25,880 --> 00:47:27,677
Um, well...

707
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:30,839
He liked maps.

708
00:47:30,960 --> 00:47:34,430
Yeah, I live by maps.
My truck's filled with them.

709
00:47:34,560 --> 00:47:36,278
He used to hear of a place
on the TV,

710
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,197
we would pull out the atlas,
we'd find where it was.

711
00:47:38,320 --> 00:47:41,869
We'd route out this, like,
little way to get there.

712
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:43,831
If there were one place in the
world where you'd go, where...

713
00:47:43,960 --> 00:47:46,599
- Florence.
- Italy, ooh.

714
00:47:46,720 --> 00:47:49,792
I haven't delivered any furniture
to Florence yet, but I'm told it's nice.

715
00:47:49,920 --> 00:47:52,195
- Yeah.
- I take it you've never been there.

716
00:47:52,320 --> 00:47:56,108
Well, you know, the El doesn't exactly
make it all the way to Florence, so...

717
00:47:57,600 --> 00:47:59,397
Oh, but I do have...

718
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:04,191
- my passport.
- You have your passport!

719
00:48:04,320 --> 00:48:05,878
- Yes, I do!
- With you?

720
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:08,275
Yes. Well, just in case I need
to quickly leave the country,

721
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:11,551
- you need to have...
- That's perfect. That's great.
Oh, you're right.

722
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,353
You're not very photogenic
at all.

723
00:48:16,000 --> 00:48:19,549
Just joking.
There aren't any stamps in that.

724
00:48:19,680 --> 00:48:21,716
Yeah, well, I haven't
gone anywhere yet.

725
00:48:21,840 --> 00:48:24,115
But, you now, I'm planning
a trip to Florence really soon,

726
00:48:24,240 --> 00:48:26,310
so, you know, I'll go.

727
00:48:27,920 --> 00:48:29,956
That'll make your dad
very proud.

728
00:48:30,080 --> 00:48:31,877
Yeah.

729
00:48:33,520 --> 00:48:35,397
You know,
in a very small way,

730
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:37,829
you kind of remind me
of him a little bit.

731
00:48:39,680 --> 00:48:43,275
I see. So, he was a classy guy,
always a gentleman.

732
00:48:43,400 --> 00:48:46,472
- A working man who...
- Who just stepped in doggy poopy.

733
00:48:46,600 --> 00:48:48,795
Ohh!

734
00:48:48,920 --> 00:48:52,435
That's, now that's classy.
That's classy!

735
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:56,719
All right, tell me more.
Where'd you grow up.

736
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,956
God, you've just become
Mr. Chatty this evening.

737
00:48:59,080 --> 00:49:00,911
Fact of the matter is,
I'm about to start shivering,

738
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:03,793
and making conversation
keeps my face from freezing.

739
00:49:07,600 --> 00:49:09,431
Thank you. I had, um,
I had a good time.

740
00:49:09,560 --> 00:49:11,152
- Oh.
- Mm.

741
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:14,397
S-S-Slippery here. Come on.

742
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:16,317
Got this far. I'll take you
the rest of the way.

743
00:49:16,440 --> 00:49:18,317
Well, you gotta watch out.
A little icy.

744
00:49:18,440 --> 00:49:21,432
So, um, you gonna go
see Peter tomorrow?

745
00:49:21,560 --> 00:49:23,994
Oh. Whoa-oa-oa! Whoa!

746
00:49:24,880 --> 00:49:26,313
Wow!

747
00:49:26,440 --> 00:49:28,351
- All right...
- Do not take me with you!

748
00:49:28,480 --> 00:49:30,038
- No, it's all right.
It's not too bad, yeah.
- You got it?

749
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:31,229
- You got it? Okay.
- Yeah.

750
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:39,754
Wow. Get this...
This is t... This is big.

751
00:49:39,880 --> 00:49:41,438
This... There we go.

752
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,755
- Okay!
- All right. Are ya all right?

753
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:49,073
This is... Oh... Mm.

754
00:49:53,960 --> 00:49:55,313
Mm.

755
00:49:57,640 --> 00:49:59,232
- All right?
- Yeah.

756
00:49:59,360 --> 00:50:00,873
- I think we're all right now.
- Okay?

757
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:02,433
- Yeah. It's just, uh...
- Okay.

758
00:50:02,560 --> 00:50:04,278
- Over this way? Okay.
- This way.

759
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:07,955
- Ow! Ohh!
- What was that?

760
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:09,832
Was that my pants
or my muscles?

761
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,599
Oh! Give me your hand.
Give me your hand.

762
00:50:13,840 --> 00:50:17,230
- Whoa-ho!
- Okay. Come on!

763
00:50:19,680 --> 00:50:22,353
- Hmm.
- Oh, man!

764
00:50:22,480 --> 00:50:24,277
You have an extra pair
of pants in your apartment?

765
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:27,597
If you fit into my pants,
I will kill myself.

766
00:50:27,720 --> 00:50:30,188
- You don't have to follow me.
- No, you block the wind.

767
00:50:38,480 --> 00:50:40,550
I'll wait 'til
ya get inside.

768
00:50:40,680 --> 00:50:43,148
Well, good night.

769
00:50:44,120 --> 00:50:45,951
Night.

770
00:50:47,640 --> 00:50:49,437
So I'll see you
when I see you?

771
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:51,551
Yeah.

772
00:51:08,680 --> 00:51:11,148
All right, Lucy,
it's either me or him.

773
00:51:11,280 --> 00:51:13,077
Him.

774
00:51:15,800 --> 00:51:17,836
You don't have to answer
right away.

775
00:51:41,240 --> 00:51:44,073
I'm having an affair.
I like Jack.

776
00:51:44,200 --> 00:51:46,111
- Who's Jack?
- Peter's brother.

777
00:51:46,240 --> 00:51:47,958
- So?
- So he thinks I'm engaged.

778
00:51:48,080 --> 00:51:50,514
- To who?
- To Peter.

779
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:54,036
Lucy, I really don't
have time for this.

780
00:51:54,160 --> 00:51:57,675
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
You have to tell me what to do.

781
00:51:57,800 --> 00:52:00,553
- Tell the truth.
- If I tell Jack
that I lied to his family,

782
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:02,477
he will never
speak to me again.

783
00:52:02,600 --> 00:52:06,673
And-And-And Ox and Midge
and Mary and-and-and Saul...

784
00:52:06,800 --> 00:52:09,394
Saul? Who's Saul?

785
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:11,317
He's a next-door neighbor.

786
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:13,158
But you know what?
Actually, he knows.

787
00:52:13,280 --> 00:52:15,635
Lucy, you're born
into a family.

788
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,194
You do not join them
like you do the marines.

789
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,348
You have to tell me
what to do.

790
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:24,277
Pull the plug.

791
00:52:24,400 --> 00:52:26,470
- You are sick.
- I'm sick?

792
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:28,909
You're cheating
on a vegetable.

793
00:52:30,720 --> 00:52:32,517
Down and dirty.

794
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,511
Are you gonna fold?
You're not gonna fold.

795
00:52:40,440 --> 00:52:43,318
Ooh, he is staying in
with a pair.

796
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,829
Very impressive.
Very bold, confident.

797
00:52:47,440 --> 00:52:51,672
Full house.
You are unlucky at cards.

798
00:52:53,600 --> 00:52:55,397
But lucky in love.

799
00:52:58,840 --> 00:53:02,879
'Member in like, uh,
fifth or sixth grade,

800
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,560
I was starting to get
really good at poker, and, uh,

801
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:07,432
goin' home
with lots of lunch money?

802
00:53:09,200 --> 00:53:10,997
I got to know the principal's
office really well.

803
00:53:12,320 --> 00:53:14,675
He always used to say to me,

804
00:53:14,800 --> 00:53:17,553
"How come you can't be
more like your brother Peter?"

805
00:53:20,880 --> 00:53:23,633
Well, you know what?
I was all right with that.

806
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:26,957
I had no problems with that
because I was proud of you.

807
00:53:27,080 --> 00:53:30,038
And I was never envious
of anything that you had.

808
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:37,557
Until now.

809
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:46,956
I'll cut the deck.
High card gets Lucy.

810
00:53:54,480 --> 00:53:57,392
All right, we'll go
best out of three.

811
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,877
So, Lucy, have you and Peter decided
where you're gonna go on your honeymoon?

812
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:03,592
I went to Cuba.

813
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:06,029
Ricky Ricardo was Cuban.

814
00:54:06,240 --> 00:54:09,789
- Didn't Peter look great today?
- Oh, that kid.

815
00:54:09,840 --> 00:54:11,796
- You know, he should have
been an actor.
- He's tall.

816
00:54:11,920 --> 00:54:13,638
All the great ones were tall.

817
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,036
Lucy, you think you can find me
a nice girl for Jack?

818
00:54:17,160 --> 00:54:19,390
- Oh, Mom, come on.
- Well, l-l-l-l...

819
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,353
I really don't know Jack's type,
so I'm not one to, um...

820
00:54:22,480 --> 00:54:24,436
I like blondes.
Chubby ones.

821
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,469
- Alan Ladd wasn't tall.
- Marshal Dillon was six-foot-five.

822
00:54:31,600 --> 00:54:33,795
Well, we all know
who Lucy's type is.

823
00:54:35,320 --> 00:54:37,311
These mashed potatoes
are so creamy.

824
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:41,073
You like brunettes.

825
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:42,997
I could never make
a good pot roast.

826
00:54:43,120 --> 00:54:44,997
You need good beef.

827
00:54:45,120 --> 00:54:48,908
Argentina has great beef.
Beef and Nazis.

828
00:54:49,040 --> 00:54:50,519
John Wayne was tall.

829
00:54:50,640 --> 00:54:52,437
Dustin Hoffman was five-six.

830
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:55,393
Would you want to see
Dustin Hoffman save the Alamo?

831
00:54:55,520 --> 00:54:58,193
- These mashed potatoes are so creamy.
- Spain has good beef.

832
00:54:58,320 --> 00:55:00,629
- Mary mashed them.
- Cesar Romero was tall.

833
00:55:00,760 --> 00:55:02,432
Cesar Romero was not Spanish.

834
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:04,551
I didn't say Cesar Romero
was Spanish.

835
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:07,638
- Well, what did you say?
- I said Cesar Romero was tall.

836
00:55:07,760 --> 00:55:09,751
- We all know he's tall.
- Well, that's what I said.

837
00:55:09,880 --> 00:55:13,236
Cesar Romero is tall.
That's all I said.

838
00:55:13,360 --> 00:55:15,749
So if you need any help
with history, don't call me.

839
00:55:15,880 --> 00:55:19,031
Now, remember, honey, if you're free
for New Year's, we want to see you.

840
00:55:19,160 --> 00:55:20,912
Thank you very much.
I had a great time.

841
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:22,792
- Us too.
- Thank you. Bye.
- Thanks for coming.

842
00:55:22,920 --> 00:55:24,353
- Bye.
- Bye-bye, Lucy.
- Bye-bye. Good night.

843
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:26,630
Hey, look, you guys.
You're under the mistletoe.

844
00:55:26,760 --> 00:55:29,672
- Kiss her, then.
- Yeah.

845
00:55:29,800 --> 00:55:32,712
- It's mistletoe.
- It's tradition.
- It's Christmas.

846
00:55:32,840 --> 00:55:34,478
Come on, idiot. Kiss her.

847
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,788
- There ya go.
- Oh, yeah.
- Bye.

848
00:55:39,920 --> 00:55:41,956
- Good night. Bye.
- Good night.
- Good night.

849
00:55:42,080 --> 00:55:43,752
- Good night.
- Come on, Mary. We're both
on dish detail tonight.

850
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,037
Regular fare.

851
00:56:02,800 --> 00:56:07,157
- One token, please.
- Oh, my god! Mary!
What are you doing here?

852
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:09,999
Hi. Do you guys wanna...
you wanna come through?

853
00:56:10,120 --> 00:56:12,588
- We can?
- Yeah, absolutely.

854
00:56:14,040 --> 00:56:15,712
Transfer, please.

855
00:56:15,840 --> 00:56:17,990
- Hi.
- Hey, who's this?

856
00:56:18,120 --> 00:56:19,872
- I'm Mary. This is Beth.
- Hi.

857
00:56:20,000 --> 00:56:21,399
Um, Mary's... Mary's my, um...

858
00:56:21,520 --> 00:56:23,795
Lucy's going to marry
my brother Peter.

859
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:26,354
What? Lucy,
you're gettin' married?

860
00:56:26,480 --> 00:56:28,436
Well, it hasn't really
been announced.

861
00:56:28,560 --> 00:56:33,236
So it's a little awkward for me
to say anything, and, um...

862
00:56:33,360 --> 00:56:35,954
- The train. Your... Okay.
- The train. Okay.
Uh, I'll see you later.

863
00:56:36,080 --> 00:56:38,913
Thank you for coming.
It's nice to meet you, Beth.

864
00:56:39,040 --> 00:56:42,237
- Girl, are you pregnant?
- Yes, I'm pregnant, Celeste.

865
00:56:42,360 --> 00:56:44,954
Lucy, you're not tellin' me what's
goin' on! You're not givin' me details.

866
00:56:45,080 --> 00:56:46,593
- What's goin' on?
- Okay, Celeste.

867
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:48,438
Celeste, you have to have sex
in order to be pregnant.

868
00:56:48,560 --> 00:56:51,120
But I thought you were engaged.

869
00:56:51,240 --> 00:56:53,879
Well, we're... We're waiting.

870
00:56:55,280 --> 00:56:56,429
Waiting?

871
00:56:57,600 --> 00:56:59,158
Peter? Hi, it's Ashley.

872
00:56:59,280 --> 00:57:01,635
Is, is
this machine working?

873
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:05,753
Look, I'm back in Chicago
and, uh, I'm kind of shocked
that you haven't called me back.

874
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:09,077
Look, I really would, uh, like to hear
from you, and I'd like to see my cat.

875
00:57:10,440 --> 00:57:11,714
Call me.

876
00:57:11,840 --> 00:57:13,671
New Year's Eve
hasn't been the same...

877
00:57:13,800 --> 00:57:15,597
since Guy Lombardo died.

878
00:57:15,720 --> 00:57:17,517
I love a clarinet.

879
00:57:17,640 --> 00:57:19,596
You know, nobody plays
a clarinet anymore.

880
00:57:19,720 --> 00:57:22,473
Guy Lombardo didn't play
the clarinet.

881
00:57:22,600 --> 00:57:24,750
I didn't say Guy Lombardo
played the clarinet.

882
00:57:24,880 --> 00:57:26,677
- You know, your Benny Goodman,
- Hey, Pop.

883
00:57:26,800 --> 00:57:29,234
- He could play the licorice stick.
- We got the Van Allan estate.

884
00:57:29,360 --> 00:57:31,828
- Hey, way to go. Attaboy!
- Oh. That's great.
- Congratulations.

885
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,110
- That's great. Attaboy.
- Way to go.
- Hey, everybody.

886
00:57:35,240 --> 00:57:37,390
Lucy's pregnant.

887
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:39,636
How did you find out?
What do you mean she's pregnant?

888
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:41,671
- How do you know?
- Where have you been?
- That's what Beth said.

889
00:57:41,800 --> 00:57:43,916
- We heard it at the token booth today.
- Jack, do you know anything about this?

890
00:57:44,040 --> 00:57:44,870
Go up to your room.

891
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,996
- Who is it?
- Joe Jr.

892
00:57:52,080 --> 00:57:53,877
I'm not here.

893
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,116
I know that trick.

894
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:58,037
Hey, my old man's
got a set of keys.

895
00:57:58,160 --> 00:58:00,913
That is illegal,
and you know it, Joey.

896
00:58:01,040 --> 00:58:02,871
- Ta-da!
- I told 'em to give me...

897
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:05,958
the same ones they use in the
winner's circle at Arlington.

898
00:58:06,080 --> 00:58:08,435
They're beautiful.

899
00:58:08,560 --> 00:58:10,357
But I can't accept them.

900
00:58:12,320 --> 00:58:17,075
I could move in here. I bet you Pop
would knock 50 bucks off the rent.

901
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:19,430
I have six months left to live.

902
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:21,949
Aw, you're just tryin'
to make me feel better.

903
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:25,277
- It's that other guy, isn't it?
- What do you mean?

904
00:58:25,400 --> 00:58:27,436
I seen the way you look at him.

905
00:58:27,560 --> 00:58:29,949
What? How do l...
How do I look at him?

906
00:58:30,080 --> 00:58:32,036
Like you just seen
your first Trans Am.

907
00:58:35,040 --> 00:58:38,794
Aw, here, take 'em.
You can lay 'em on my coffin.

908
00:58:41,840 --> 00:58:43,637
Thank you.

909
00:58:50,560 --> 00:58:52,676
Are you wearin'
the black bra? Ow!

910
00:58:54,040 --> 00:58:56,270
I love black underwears.

911
00:59:03,280 --> 00:59:06,033
- Jack.
- What are you doing here?

912
00:59:09,880 --> 00:59:12,917
- You're going to a party.
- Yeah, my friend Celeste
is having a party tonight.

913
00:59:13,040 --> 00:59:15,429
Great. Hey, I'll drive you.

914
00:59:15,560 --> 00:59:17,516
Oh, you know what? It's really
not that far. It's... It's fine.

915
00:59:17,640 --> 00:59:19,631
No, no, no. No.
Come on, come on.

916
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,558
Okay, but it's,
it's really not that far.

917
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,319
I move a lot of things
with this truck.

918
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,830
- So, is, um, everything okay?
- Why? Why wouldn't it be okay?

919
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,190
- You're just acting really weird.
- No, no, I'm not being weird.

920
00:59:31,320 --> 00:59:33,197
- Yes, you are.
- No, I'm not being weird.

921
00:59:34,800 --> 00:59:38,110
- So, what about Peter?
- What about Peter?

922
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,073
Peter is going to have a lot
to deal with when he wakes up.

923
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:43,953
- Lucy! Hi. How are you?
- Hi!

924
00:59:44,080 --> 00:59:47,959
Oh, come on. Come in. Hey, everybody.
Lucy and her fiance are here.

925
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:51,950
- Lucy! Hey, how's it goin'?
- Jerry, you know Peter, right?

926
00:59:52,080 --> 00:59:54,753
Thank you. Hi.
Take his coat, Cindy.

927
00:59:54,880 --> 00:59:56,438
- Peter?
- I gotta talk to you.

928
00:59:56,560 --> 00:59:57,879
Geez, he looks good.

929
00:59:58,000 --> 01:00:00,116
That's not Peter.
That's Jack.

930
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,231
- Uh, who's Jack again?
- Peter's brother.

931
01:00:02,360 --> 01:00:04,715
- Peter's the guy that's in a coma.
- Yeah.

932
01:00:04,840 --> 01:00:07,798
- So then why did you bring Jack?
- I didn't bring Jack.
He followed me here.

933
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:10,514
- So Jack's the fiance?
- No, Peter.

934
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:12,756
- Peter doesn't even know you exist.
- I know.

935
01:00:12,880 --> 01:00:15,474
- So Jack is Peter?
- Yeah.

936
01:00:15,600 --> 01:00:16,874
- Lucy...
- Yeah?

937
01:00:17,000 --> 01:00:19,468
They have doctors
for this kind of thing.

938
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:24,435
Excuse me. Uh! That's spiked.

939
01:00:24,560 --> 01:00:27,552
- Thank God.
- You shouldn't have any.

940
01:00:27,680 --> 01:00:30,319
- Why not?
- Because it's not good for the baby.

941
01:00:32,560 --> 01:00:35,313
- Wait a minute, will ya?
- It's freezin'! Watch out.

942
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:39,228
Uh, this whole evening did not
work out well at all, and, uh...

943
01:00:39,360 --> 01:00:42,033
Oh, and I'm supposed to share
some responsibility in that?

944
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:45,596
No. Now... Would you
slow down a little bit?

945
01:00:45,720 --> 01:00:49,429
Look. It was just
a misunderstanding,

946
01:00:49,560 --> 01:00:53,394
- and on top of the Joe Jr. Thing...
- Excuse me?

947
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,875
- It's nothing.
- No, no, no. There's no "nothing" now.

948
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:58,753
What Joe Jr. Thing?

949
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:01,348
- The leaning thing.
- "The leaning thing."

950
01:01:01,480 --> 01:01:03,038
- Yeah.
- Okay.

951
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:06,869
Um... What do you... What do you
mean by "the leaning thing"?

952
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:10,390
- Because he gave me flowers?
- And then you leaned.

953
01:01:10,520 --> 01:01:12,795
- And then I leaned.
- Yeah.

954
01:01:12,920 --> 01:01:15,070
Okay. How did I lean
when I leaned?

955
01:01:15,200 --> 01:01:17,350
- How were you leaning?
- Yeah.
- It was a lot different than hugging.

956
01:01:17,480 --> 01:01:18,913
Hugging's very different.

957
01:01:19,040 --> 01:01:21,190
Hugging, that involves
arms and hands,

958
01:01:21,320 --> 01:01:26,189
and leaning is whole bodies
moving in, like this.

959
01:01:26,320 --> 01:01:28,709
Leaning involves wanting...

960
01:01:30,360 --> 01:01:32,999
and accepting.

961
01:01:33,120 --> 01:01:35,236
Leaning...

962
01:01:36,800 --> 01:01:38,836
Hey, Luce.

963
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:41,394
Is this guy bothering you?

964
01:01:43,600 --> 01:01:44,999
No, no.

965
01:01:45,120 --> 01:01:49,477
Are you sure? 'Cause it
looks like he's leaning.

966
01:01:50,720 --> 01:01:52,836
Thank you. See?

967
01:01:54,360 --> 01:01:56,715
I'll be right over here
if you need me.

968
01:01:56,840 --> 01:01:59,308
Okay. Thank you very much.

969
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:01,874
I know karate.

970
01:02:06,120 --> 01:02:10,033
Okay. Now... All right.
What about the other thing?

971
01:02:10,160 --> 01:02:12,390
The other thing?
The other misunderstanding?

972
01:02:13,680 --> 01:02:16,194
Why did you think
I was pregnant?

973
01:02:16,320 --> 01:02:20,029
Well, Mary said that she
had heard something like that.

974
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:24,472
- And you believed her?
- I didn't have any reason
not to believe her.

975
01:02:24,600 --> 01:02:26,989
So the only reason your brother
would want to marry someone like me...

976
01:02:27,120 --> 01:02:29,634
- is if I was pregnant, right?
- No, no.

977
01:02:33,840 --> 01:02:35,751
Good night.

978
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:38,957
Fact is, you're not
really Peter's type.

979
01:02:39,080 --> 01:02:41,389
Yeah, Jack? All right,
whose type am I?

980
01:02:44,600 --> 01:02:47,637
- Thank you.
- Look, it's a great idea,
you and Peter.

981
01:02:47,760 --> 01:02:49,796
It's just not obvious
to the whole world, that's all.

982
01:02:49,920 --> 01:02:52,070
You know what, Jack? I've had
a really lousy Christmas.

983
01:02:52,200 --> 01:02:54,555
You've just managed
to kill my New Year's.

984
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:58,309
- Lf you come back on Easter,
you can burn down my apartment.
- Hey, come on, Lucy.

985
01:02:58,440 --> 01:03:02,035
- What do you want from me, Jack?
- I want you not to be unhappy.

986
01:03:02,160 --> 01:03:04,993
And what are you, the happiness
guru, Jack? Are you happy?

987
01:03:05,120 --> 01:03:07,759
Because I don't remember you having
had a conversation with your father.

988
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:09,757
I mean, you do want to leave
the business, don't you,

989
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:12,678
or is this just like
another miscommunication
that we are having here?

990
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:14,597
What do you know
about my family?

991
01:03:14,720 --> 01:03:16,517
Spending a week with 'em
does not make you an expert.

992
01:03:16,640 --> 01:03:18,756
Spending a lifetime with them
hasn't made you one either.

993
01:03:22,440 --> 01:03:25,910
Yeah, well, I know that keeping
your family happy gets complicated.

994
01:03:26,040 --> 01:03:28,634
Would your father be happy knowing
you're sitting in a token booth,

995
01:03:28,760 --> 01:03:30,751
planning vacations
that you aren't taking?

996
01:03:33,360 --> 01:03:35,874
No, he wouldn't. You're right.

997
01:03:38,640 --> 01:03:40,870
But you have no idea
what it's like to be alone.

998
01:03:41,000 --> 01:03:43,958
Hey, you have Peter.

999
01:03:44,080 --> 01:03:45,957
I don't have anybody.

1000
01:03:46,080 --> 01:03:48,036
Happy New Year!
Happy New Year!

1001
01:03:49,840 --> 01:03:52,479
Good night.

1002
01:03:56,400 --> 01:03:58,231
Happy New Year!

1003
01:04:00,920 --> 01:04:02,717
Happy New Year.

1004
01:04:04,040 --> 01:04:07,794
For auld lang syne, my dear

1005
01:04:07,920 --> 01:04:12,072
For auld lang syne

1006
01:04:12,200 --> 01:04:16,398
We'll take a cup
of kindness yet

1007
01:04:16,520 --> 01:04:21,036
In days of auld lang syne

1008
01:04:21,160 --> 01:04:24,755
For auld lang syne, my dear

1009
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:28,915
Ox, they called me and told me
to get down here. What happened?

1010
01:04:29,040 --> 01:04:32,112
- He's awake.
- Oh, that... Oh.

1011
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:34,834
Will the Byers family
please meet in the solarium?

1012
01:04:34,960 --> 01:04:36,837
- Will the Byers...
- Boy, will he be glad to see you.

1013
01:04:36,960 --> 01:04:38,757
Yeah.

1014
01:04:40,120 --> 01:04:41,997
Peter?

1015
01:04:42,120 --> 01:04:45,396
Peter.
Your family's here, Peter.

1016
01:05:22,600 --> 01:05:24,556
Wh-Who are you?

1017
01:05:29,720 --> 01:05:32,029
My god.

1018
01:05:33,120 --> 01:05:36,237
He's got amnesia.

1019
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:42,599
Lacunar amnesia is a condition
in which memory loss...

1020
01:05:42,720 --> 01:05:45,154
is localized and patchy,

1021
01:05:45,280 --> 01:05:47,396
limited to isolated events.

1022
01:05:47,520 --> 01:05:50,592
- Selective amnesia?
- Okay. Exactly.

1023
01:05:50,720 --> 01:05:55,714
Um, I'm sorry. You... I-I need to tell
you something that is really important.

1024
01:05:57,120 --> 01:05:58,917
- I-I was never...
- Pregnant?

1025
01:05:59,040 --> 01:06:02,953
- Huh?
- We know. Jack called us.

1026
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:06,072
- Jack.
- Hey. So he's come out of it, huh?

1027
01:06:06,200 --> 01:06:09,556
- Oh, I'm so glad you're here.
- Excuse me. Doctor? He's up again.

1028
01:06:09,680 --> 01:06:11,557
All right, let's go.

1029
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:14,353
Hey, Jack, I am so glad
you're here.

1030
01:06:14,480 --> 01:06:16,675
- Saul!
- Now, listen. Let me handle it.

1031
01:06:16,800 --> 01:06:19,268
I'm too old a friend and too old
a person for them to kill.

1032
01:06:19,400 --> 01:06:21,436
- I'll take care of it, all right?
- Okay.

1033
01:06:21,560 --> 01:06:22,788
- And I'll do it right now.
- Okay.
- Come on. Let's go.

1034
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:24,512
Right behind you.

1035
01:06:26,120 --> 01:06:28,111
- How you feelin', champ?
- I don't know.

1036
01:06:30,000 --> 01:06:32,514
- Hi.
- Hey, you remember her?

1037
01:06:36,400 --> 01:06:39,949
- Should I?
- Look closely.

1038
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:44,833
She looks
a little familiar. Why?

1039
01:06:44,960 --> 01:06:47,428
- I think it's coming back.
- I think so.

1040
01:06:47,560 --> 01:06:50,279
What's coming back?
Tell me. Tell me. What?

1041
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:52,868
- You have amnesia.
- I do?

1042
01:06:53,000 --> 01:06:55,468
Peter, you're engaged.

1043
01:06:55,600 --> 01:06:57,795
- To who?
- To Lucy.

1044
01:06:57,920 --> 01:07:00,275
Lucy? Who's Lucy?

1045
01:07:00,400 --> 01:07:02,755
- You don't remember, do you?
- Excuse me.

1046
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,031
- Got some Jell-O for you today.
- Do I like Jell-O?

1047
01:07:06,160 --> 01:07:09,197
- Yum!
- I think he's had enough
excitement for one evening.

1048
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:11,788
- Let's all go home.
- Hang in there, champ.

1049
01:07:11,920 --> 01:07:14,480
- Good night, honey.
- Good night, Mom.

1050
01:07:14,600 --> 01:07:17,239
- Oh, it's so good to see you!
- Mom!

1051
01:07:17,360 --> 01:07:19,476
- He looks so good, you know?
- He's going to be fine.

1052
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,670
I think he looks wonderful.

1053
01:07:21,800 --> 01:07:24,439
- All right, we'll be back.
- Jack, you too. Come on. Let's go home.

1054
01:07:26,920 --> 01:07:30,390
- Saul, where have you been?
- What, I'm not allowed
to go to the bathroom?

1055
01:07:30,520 --> 01:07:33,193
- Saul!
- I'm handling it. I will tell them.

1056
01:07:33,320 --> 01:07:35,231
When? When?
On my golden anniversary?

1057
01:07:35,360 --> 01:07:39,148
- Lucy, I'll tell them!
- You'd better tell them!
- I said I'd tell them!

1058
01:07:39,280 --> 01:07:42,033
A, B, C, D, E, F, G

1059
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:17,395
Jack, you've been
really great this week.

1060
01:08:19,840 --> 01:08:23,833
Yeah, like, uh, when I accused
you of lying to everybody.

1061
01:08:23,960 --> 01:08:28,158
Or when I accused you of having
a relationship with Joe Jr.

1062
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:32,558
Or when I thought you were pregnant
and I announced it to all your friends.

1063
01:08:32,680 --> 01:08:35,148
You've had a really busy week
this week, haven't you?

1064
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:39,477
Look, Jack, I, um...

1065
01:08:41,680 --> 01:08:44,319
Starting tomorrow, uh, things...

1066
01:08:44,440 --> 01:08:46,351
are probably gonna be
kind of different.

1067
01:08:48,040 --> 01:08:50,190
Yeah.

1068
01:08:51,800 --> 01:08:53,950
I just wanted you to know
that you've become, uh,

1069
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:00,514
a really good friend.

1070
01:09:04,720 --> 01:09:06,836
Okay.

1071
01:09:07,960 --> 01:09:10,190
Good friend. Lucy!

1072
01:09:10,320 --> 01:09:13,232
Yeah?

1073
01:09:13,360 --> 01:09:17,319
I didn't mean, uh, what I said
about you and Peter.

1074
01:09:17,440 --> 01:09:20,796
I think you two are gonna make
a really terrific couple,

1075
01:09:20,920 --> 01:09:24,435
and, uh, I'm really glad that
you won't be alone anymore.

1076
01:09:29,480 --> 01:09:31,471
- Good-bye.
- Bye.

1077
01:10:19,280 --> 01:10:21,077
Jack, is that you?

1078
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:24,869
Hey, Pop.

1079
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:27,389
- Brought you some doughnuts.
- You're a savior.

1080
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:31,680
Your mother's got me eatin'
these fat-free bran muffins.

1081
01:10:31,800 --> 01:10:34,075
They taste like plywood.

1082
01:10:34,200 --> 01:10:38,796
- Catchin' up?
- Yeah, it's been almost a week
since I read the obituaries.

1083
01:10:38,920 --> 01:10:41,388
You know, we missed a lot of good stuff
the day after Christmas.

1084
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:46,757
Been a hell of a week,
hasn't it?

1085
01:10:46,880 --> 01:10:50,395
Life is a pain in the ass.
I'll tell ya. You know?

1086
01:10:50,520 --> 01:10:55,196
You work hard, try to provide for
the family, and then, for one minute,

1087
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,757
everything's good.

1088
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,713
Everyone's well.
Everyone's happy.

1089
01:11:01,840 --> 01:11:05,230
In... In that one minute,
you have peace.

1090
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:10,830
Pop, this isn't that minute.

1091
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:15,790
- What do you mean?
- Um...

1092
01:11:19,320 --> 01:11:21,356
You remember that rocking chair
I made for Grandma?

1093
01:11:21,480 --> 01:11:25,109
Are you kidding me? It's so
fancy, she won't even sit in it.

1094
01:11:25,240 --> 01:11:28,755
This fancy chair, two months ago
I sold three just like it.

1095
01:11:28,880 --> 01:11:32,350
I've sold two dining tables.
I got orders for six more.

1096
01:11:32,480 --> 01:11:34,277
That's a good side business.

1097
01:11:34,400 --> 01:11:37,392
This is not a side business.
This is... good business.

1098
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,754
Wait a second.
You don't want my business?

1099
01:11:48,720 --> 01:11:50,676
No, I don't.

1100
01:11:56,920 --> 01:11:59,878
- How long have you felt this way?
- A long time.

1101
01:12:01,320 --> 01:12:02,799
Well, why didn't you
say something sooner?

1102
01:12:04,880 --> 01:12:08,839
I could've sold the whole damn thing
to Uncle Eddy for twice its value.

1103
01:12:08,960 --> 01:12:11,633
I could've taken your mother
on the cruise with Kathie Lee Gifford.

1104
01:12:13,240 --> 01:12:15,071
You're not mad at me?

1105
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:17,077
Are you nuts?

1106
01:12:17,280 --> 01:12:19,589
You are nuts! You wanna
make rocking chairs.

1107
01:12:22,440 --> 01:12:25,637
Oh, hey, Mrs. Fletcher
finally went, huh?

1108
01:12:25,760 --> 01:12:28,320
Her dining room alone
has got to be worth 40 grand.

1109
01:12:28,440 --> 01:12:32,638
Yeah. Well, those McMurphy boys, they
were movin' in before the deed was done.

1110
01:12:32,760 --> 01:12:35,228
- That's their problem.
They're too pushy.
- Very pushy, yeah.

1111
01:12:35,360 --> 01:12:38,591
- We'll call them next week.
- You'll call 'em next week.

1112
01:12:38,720 --> 01:12:41,598
That's right.
I'll call them next week.

1113
01:12:41,720 --> 01:12:44,632
- Okay.
- Do I get a doughnut?
- Uh, I'm sorry.

1114
01:12:44,760 --> 01:12:49,072
22, 10, 40.
Eighth-grade locker combination.

1115
01:12:49,200 --> 01:12:52,158
- Birth date: 3-11-59.
- You have to remember Lucy.

1116
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:55,556
Social Security number:
144-60-6894.

1117
01:12:55,680 --> 01:12:58,638
You love her. You just...
don't remember her.

1118
01:12:58,760 --> 01:13:01,877
3.73 grade point average,
Northwestern University.

1119
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:04,673
- Can I talk to Peter alone?
- Everything okay, Saul?

1120
01:13:04,800 --> 01:13:08,713
- Senior class president, 1981.
- I just wanna talk to my godson.

1121
01:13:08,840 --> 01:13:10,512
- Let me take that for you.
- Thanks, Mom.
- We'll be back.

1122
01:13:10,640 --> 01:13:12,631
- Okay, we'll see you later, honey.
- You sure, Saul?

1123
01:13:12,760 --> 01:13:15,513
- Yeah, yeah, sure.
- See ya, son.
- See ya, Dad.

1124
01:13:17,880 --> 01:13:20,189
Peter, I've known you
since you were born.

1125
01:13:20,320 --> 01:13:24,438
I've been to every major event
in your life from Cub Scouts to...

1126
01:13:24,560 --> 01:13:27,279
well, to the day you discovered
hair on your schmeckel.

1127
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:30,875
You got a good education.

1128
01:13:31,000 --> 01:13:35,039
You're very popular
with all those friends of yours.
You make a nice living.

1129
01:13:35,160 --> 01:13:37,276
And everybody knows
you're a good-lookin' kid.

1130
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:42,317
But, Peter, you're a putz.

1131
01:13:42,440 --> 01:13:46,319
- Excuse me?
- Now, look, I'm your godfather.

1132
01:13:46,440 --> 01:13:49,079
I mean, I love ya. I couldn't love ya
any more if you were my own son.

1133
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:54,669
But the fact of the matter is
you're... Well, you're a putz.

1134
01:13:56,720 --> 01:13:58,836
Is there a point to this?

1135
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:00,757
Lucy.

1136
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:05,398
Peter, there's something...
you have to know about her.

1137
01:14:06,760 --> 01:14:08,591
You see, she...

1138
01:14:09,840 --> 01:14:12,434
Well... Uh...

1139
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:16,474
She's...

1140
01:14:17,560 --> 01:14:20,597
You know...

1141
01:14:20,720 --> 01:14:22,950
She's not only your fiancee,
she's your guardian angel.

1142
01:14:24,360 --> 01:14:28,433
Yeah! Peter,
she saved your life!

1143
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:33,156
Now, she's comin' to see you today,
and I want you to do yourself a favor.

1144
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:36,033
I want you to look deeply into her eyes
and listen with the heart of a man...

1145
01:14:36,160 --> 01:14:39,470
who has just been given
a second chance at life.

1146
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:43,195
And after two minutes, if you're
not madly in love with her,

1147
01:14:43,320 --> 01:14:48,678
why, tell her you wanna break up,
and you can go back to being a putz.

1148
01:14:48,800 --> 01:14:52,998
But if in the two minutes you see what
the rest of us only took seconds to see,

1149
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:55,634
you will propose to her
for the second time...

1150
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:58,513
and marry her before she
has a chance to escape.

1151
01:15:03,680 --> 01:15:06,990
Uh, before she comes, take
a little time and think about...

1152
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:09,315
what an old putz just told ya.

1153
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:11,237
All right?

1154
01:15:13,760 --> 01:15:18,356
You know, if I was 40 years
younger, I'd marry her myself.

1155
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:22,314
That is, if she'd convert.
Hey, that's a joke.

1156
01:15:22,440 --> 01:15:24,271
Oh, I know that.

1157
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,790
- Lucy!
- Hi.

1158
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:50,151
- Hi.
- Um.

1159
01:15:51,520 --> 01:15:54,637
I came to bring you
back your things.

1160
01:15:54,760 --> 01:15:56,557
Would you like a sandwich?

1161
01:15:58,400 --> 01:16:02,871
No, no. I'm okay. Thanks.
Can I get you anything?

1162
01:16:03,000 --> 01:16:04,558
I wish I had my own clothes.

1163
01:16:04,680 --> 01:16:06,636
Well, I like your, um,
blue pinstripe.

1164
01:16:06,760 --> 01:16:08,352
- Double-breasted?
- Yeah.

1165
01:16:08,480 --> 01:16:09,629
- Yeah, that's my favorite too.
- Really?

1166
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:10,954
Yeah.

1167
01:16:12,720 --> 01:16:14,278
Please sit down.

1168
01:16:24,640 --> 01:16:28,519
I, I saw a picture of you, uh,
when you saved the three squirrels.

1169
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:32,030
Oh. They never call.
They never write.

1170
01:16:32,160 --> 01:16:33,957
That was a long time ago.

1171
01:16:34,080 --> 01:16:37,470
Yeah, I guess we, we don't get to do
many heroic things as an adult, huh?

1172
01:16:37,600 --> 01:16:41,229
Oh, that's for sure.
You do, though!

1173
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:45,069
Oh, no. Jumping in front
of that train was unusual.

1174
01:16:45,200 --> 01:16:49,955
I don't think I've done anything
truly heroic in my whole life.

1175
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:53,038
- I chased a purse-snatcher once.
- Well, that's something.

1176
01:16:53,160 --> 01:16:55,116
I pretended
to pull a hamstring.

1177
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:59,631
Well, most guys probably wouldn't have
chased after him in the first place.

1178
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:03,594
I mean, I work at the EI.
Believe me, I know.

1179
01:17:03,720 --> 01:17:06,359
You give up your seat
every day in the train.

1180
01:17:06,480 --> 01:17:09,756
Well... But that's not heroic.

1181
01:17:09,880 --> 01:17:13,475
It is to the person
who sits in it.

1182
01:17:13,600 --> 01:17:19,038
And you always gave me something
to look forward to every day, so...

1183
01:17:19,160 --> 01:17:22,596
You know, you do
remind me of someone.

1184
01:17:22,720 --> 01:17:25,439
It's probably you.

1185
01:17:28,880 --> 01:17:30,518
Thank you.

1186
01:17:30,640 --> 01:17:33,712
Uh, uh, ma'am! Excuse me.
Excuse me, ma'am, uh...

1187
01:17:34,840 --> 01:17:37,229
What apartment?

1188
01:17:37,360 --> 01:17:40,033
- You're new.
- Yes, ma'am. What apartment?

1189
01:17:40,160 --> 01:17:41,639
I'm going to Peter
Callaghan's apartment.

1190
01:17:41,760 --> 01:17:43,432
Uh, and your name, please?

1191
01:17:43,560 --> 01:17:46,677
Ashley Bartlett Bacon.
I am Peter's fiancee.

1192
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:50,517
You're not his fiancee.

1193
01:17:50,640 --> 01:17:52,710
- Huh?
- Huh?

1194
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:54,672
Hey, lookin' good!

1195
01:17:54,800 --> 01:17:56,870
Yeah, well, they're movin' me
to the second floor.

1196
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:59,070
Great.
Mind if I drove?

1197
01:17:59,200 --> 01:18:01,236
Uh, no problem.
Uh, see you by the elevators.

1198
01:18:01,360 --> 01:18:02,952
- All right.
- Okay.

1199
01:18:03,080 --> 01:18:06,470
- There we go.
- Oh. Uh, it's a little drafty.

1200
01:18:06,600 --> 01:18:08,272
Here. I brought you
some contraband.

1201
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:12,518
Oh. Chocolate peanut butter.
Thanks.

1202
01:18:12,640 --> 01:18:16,030
- Hey, Lucy's pretty terrific,
isn't she?
- Oh, yeah.

1203
01:18:16,160 --> 01:18:19,789
- We're engaged, you know.
- Yeah, I heard that.

1204
01:18:21,040 --> 01:18:22,917
Now this I remember.

1205
01:18:23,040 --> 01:18:27,033
Everything is better. Everything
looks better, feels better.

1206
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:29,196
Even this chocolate
peanut butter tastes better.

1207
01:18:29,320 --> 01:18:32,118
Good. It's fudge mint.

1208
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,356
Whatever. I'm reborn.

1209
01:18:34,480 --> 01:18:37,358
If you were a priest right now,
I'd confess everything to you.

1210
01:18:37,480 --> 01:18:40,995
No, no, don't confess. I'm
trying to be positive right now.
Just eat your ice cream.

1211
01:18:41,120 --> 01:18:43,429
I don't even know what my secretary
sent Mom and Dad for Christmas.

1212
01:18:43,560 --> 01:18:45,630
It was a fruit basket. Now,
look, I don't wanna get in...

1213
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:47,876
- I've never been faithful to a woman.
- I'm gonna leave.

1214
01:18:48,000 --> 01:18:50,639
Remember the squirrels?

1215
01:18:50,760 --> 01:18:53,593
Don't even say it.

1216
01:18:53,720 --> 01:18:57,599
First I knocked them out
of their nest with a rock.

1217
01:18:57,720 --> 01:19:00,359
- Peter.
- Then I saved them.

1218
01:19:00,480 --> 01:19:03,438
Eww. Did you say
any of this to Lucy?

1219
01:19:03,560 --> 01:19:07,633
That was in the past. I'm making
a clean start with Lucy. She is...

1220
01:19:07,760 --> 01:19:09,796
She is... She...

1221
01:19:12,600 --> 01:19:15,398
What is she? She's...

1222
01:19:15,520 --> 01:19:18,353
I'd say that she gets under your
skin as soon as you meet her.

1223
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:23,679
She drives you so nuts you don't
know whether to hug her or, or
just really arm wrestle her.

1224
01:19:23,800 --> 01:19:27,918
She would go all the way to Europe
just to get a stamp in her passport.

1225
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:30,190
I don't know if that
amounts to insanity...

1226
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:35,189
or just being really,
really likable.

1227
01:19:36,360 --> 01:19:38,999
No, that's not it.

1228
01:19:39,120 --> 01:19:42,157
But she's gotta be
really special. She's gotta be.

1229
01:19:42,280 --> 01:19:45,795
And I can spend the rest
of my life finding out why.

1230
01:19:45,920 --> 01:19:48,036
I don't have to know now.
I don't have to know tomorrow.

1231
01:19:48,160 --> 01:19:52,358
I, I don't have to know
in a year or ten years.

1232
01:19:52,480 --> 01:19:56,189
I don't... I don't have to... I don't
have to have all the answers today, or...

1233
01:19:56,320 --> 01:19:59,790
Maybe someday I'll have a clue,
but it doesn't mean I,

1234
01:19:59,920 --> 01:20:01,797
I can't make
a lifetime commitment.

1235
01:20:01,920 --> 01:20:04,718
Does this make any sense?

1236
01:20:04,840 --> 01:20:07,593
Not really, but that's
common after a head injury.

1237
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:09,517
My shoes.

1238
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:13,114
Ah. Oh, hi.

1239
01:20:13,240 --> 01:20:15,037
- What'd they say?
- Who?

1240
01:20:15,160 --> 01:20:16,559
The Callaghans.
Are... Are they inside?

1241
01:20:16,680 --> 01:20:18,830
You missed 'em.

1242
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:22,111
- Well, what was
their reaction to the news?
- I didn't tell 'em yet.

1243
01:20:22,240 --> 01:20:24,435
What do ya... What do ya...
What do you... What do you mean,
Saul? What a... What a...

1244
01:20:24,560 --> 01:20:26,755
- Now what about Peter?
- Well, I didn't tell him either. L...

1245
01:20:26,880 --> 01:20:29,075
- What? Saul, you said
you were gonna handle this.
- I'll handle it.

1246
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:30,872
- This is handling it?
- This is handling it.

1247
01:20:31,000 --> 01:20:32,274
- Saul?
- Listen... What?

1248
01:20:32,400 --> 01:20:35,358
- You're fired.
- Fired?

1249
01:20:35,480 --> 01:20:37,072
- Sorry.
- Pardon me.

1250
01:20:38,440 --> 01:20:40,237
Huh!

1251
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:47,030
- Two, please.
- Four, please.

1252
01:20:57,640 --> 01:21:01,110
Dr. Biloxi.
Dr. Biloxi to I.C.U. North.

1253
01:21:01,240 --> 01:21:04,869
Dr. Biloxi.
Dr. Biloxi to I.C.U. North.

1254
01:21:05,000 --> 01:21:07,434
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

1255
01:21:07,560 --> 01:21:10,393
- Ashley!
- Scumbag!

1256
01:21:10,520 --> 01:21:12,476
You're engaged?

1257
01:21:12,600 --> 01:21:16,479
May I remind you
that you proposed to me?

1258
01:21:16,600 --> 01:21:18,397
You said no. We broke up.

1259
01:21:18,520 --> 01:21:21,751
No, no. I was confused.
We stepped back.

1260
01:21:21,880 --> 01:21:24,917
- You moved to Portugal.
- Yes, well, well, I, I didn't
think you were going...

1261
01:21:25,040 --> 01:21:27,952
to run out and marry the first
bimbo that you came across.

1262
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:30,230
- Lucy's not a bimbo.
- Lucy?

1263
01:21:30,360 --> 01:21:33,557
- Lucy who?
- I don't remember.

1264
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,796
Liar!

1265
01:21:35,920 --> 01:21:39,754
I don't remember proposing.
I was in a coma. I have amnesia.

1266
01:21:39,880 --> 01:21:42,952
Amnesia?
Oh, well, now that's rich.

1267
01:21:43,080 --> 01:21:45,435
All right, fine.
I want my stuff back.

1268
01:21:45,560 --> 01:21:47,869
Fine. Then I want
my stuff back.

1269
01:21:48,000 --> 01:21:49,638
- What stuff?
- Your nose.

1270
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:54,318
- You can't take my nose back.
- I paid for it.

1271
01:21:54,440 --> 01:21:57,113
Well, then, here.
You paid for these too.

1272
01:21:57,240 --> 01:22:00,471
Oh, keep 'em.
I'm a changed man, Ashley.

1273
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:06,591
Go ahead. Go ahead and marry
her, you one-balled bastard.

1274
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:13,669
Holy buckets, Peter.

1275
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:15,711
Movin' on to
greener pastures.

1276
01:22:15,840 --> 01:22:18,638
- Yeah!
- You got it, pal.

1277
01:22:18,760 --> 01:22:21,399
Yes, the doctor
will be right there.

1278
01:22:21,520 --> 01:22:23,317
- Lucy, they moved him.
- They moved him?

1279
01:22:23,440 --> 01:22:25,590
- Come with me.
- Where?
- Downstairs.

1280
01:22:25,720 --> 01:22:28,678
- Lucy.
- What? Oh.

1281
01:22:30,120 --> 01:22:31,712
- Lucy.
- Hi, Peter.

1282
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:33,034
- Hi.
- My god, you look really good.

1283
01:22:33,160 --> 01:22:34,718
- I feel really good.
- Um...

1284
01:22:34,840 --> 01:22:38,435
You know what? Facing death
makes a man evaluate his life.

1285
01:22:38,560 --> 01:22:41,233
And I've been thinkin' about mine,
and I haven't liked what I've seen.

1286
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:43,555
I've seen a man who has
courtside tickets to the Bulls,

1287
01:22:43,680 --> 01:22:46,148
a, a lucrative
investment portfolio,

1288
01:22:46,280 --> 01:22:49,238
an apartment on La Rue
du Faubourg, Saint Honore.

1289
01:22:49,360 --> 01:22:51,476
- Where?
- Paris.

1290
01:22:51,600 --> 01:22:54,194
But I've also seen a man
who has no one to trust.

1291
01:22:54,320 --> 01:22:56,151
No one to want
to have a son with.

1292
01:22:56,280 --> 01:22:59,158
You were there when I
needed someone the most.

1293
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,714
You gave me
a second chance at life.

1294
01:23:01,840 --> 01:23:04,070
Took a coma to wake me up.

1295
01:23:04,200 --> 01:23:08,990
My family loves ya.
I might as well love you.

1296
01:23:09,120 --> 01:23:13,113
Lucy Eleanor Moderatz,
will you marry me?

1297
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:18,195
Wanda? Wanda?
Are you all right?

1298
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:20,515
- Um...
- Honey? Wanda?

1299
01:23:20,640 --> 01:23:22,915
Your hair's lookin'
very big tonight.

1300
01:23:23,040 --> 01:23:25,873
Why, thank you.
I love your new cologne.

1301
01:23:26,000 --> 01:23:28,514
Yeah, it's called "Paris Guy."
It's from France.

1302
01:23:28,640 --> 01:23:29,709
- Nice.
- How ya doin'?

1303
01:23:29,840 --> 01:23:31,273
Hey, are you goin'
to see Lucy?

1304
01:23:31,400 --> 01:23:33,231
Yeah.

1305
01:23:33,360 --> 01:23:35,555
She is the best-lookin'
chick in this building.

1306
01:23:35,680 --> 01:23:37,716
Hey!

1307
01:23:37,840 --> 01:23:41,992
But you are the best-lookin'
chick on the third floor.

1308
01:23:42,120 --> 01:23:44,793
- Joe Jr.!
- Phyllis!

1309
01:23:50,640 --> 01:23:51,789
No? This one?

1310
01:23:53,440 --> 01:23:56,591
This one? Oh!

1311
01:23:56,720 --> 01:24:00,759
I don't want any flowers from you,
I am not wearing black underwear,

1312
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:04,031
and I definitely do not
want to move in with you, Joe...

1313
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:06,435
Jack.

1314
01:24:06,560 --> 01:24:09,313
Well, I don't have any flowers,
I wouldn't mind seeing
the black underwear,

1315
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:13,797
but under the circumstances, I don't
think we should move in together.

1316
01:24:15,760 --> 01:24:17,796
I thought you were Joe Jr.

1317
01:24:17,920 --> 01:24:20,832
I get that a lot.

1318
01:24:22,480 --> 01:24:24,755
- Do you wanna come in?
- Yeah.

1319
01:24:24,880 --> 01:24:26,950
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1320
01:24:33,560 --> 01:24:34,959
- Wow. So that's...
- Wow.

1321
01:24:35,080 --> 01:24:37,230
- The wedding dress, huh?
- Hmm?

1322
01:24:37,360 --> 01:24:39,590
The wedding dress.

1323
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:42,871
It works good as a tie too.

1324
01:24:43,000 --> 01:24:46,117
Ow. Yeah.

1325
01:24:46,240 --> 01:24:51,030
I just wanted to give you this before
all the presents started to pile up.

1326
01:24:51,160 --> 01:24:55,756
I was droppin' off some furniture in
Little Italy. I look in a window, and...

1327
01:25:01,320 --> 01:25:03,117
Florence.

1328
01:25:03,240 --> 01:25:05,071
Florence.

1329
01:25:08,200 --> 01:25:11,715
Thank you.
It's really beautiful.

1330
01:25:14,080 --> 01:25:19,359
And I wanted to say that
I think that Peter...

1331
01:25:19,480 --> 01:25:21,471
is a very lucky guy.

1332
01:25:24,280 --> 01:25:25,918
Thank you.

1333
01:25:26,040 --> 01:25:28,315
I had to say that because you're
gonna be my sister-in-law.

1334
01:25:28,440 --> 01:25:33,389
Ha, ha, ha, ha. Well, I guess we'll be
seeing a lot of each other then.

1335
01:25:39,920 --> 01:25:41,717
- I better get goin'.
- Yeah.

1336
01:25:44,880 --> 01:25:47,633
Hey, Jack. Jack!

1337
01:25:47,760 --> 01:25:49,876
Yeah?

1338
01:25:51,080 --> 01:25:53,469
Can you give me
any reason...

1339
01:25:53,600 --> 01:25:55,397
why I shouldn't
marry your brother?

1340
01:25:56,720 --> 01:25:58,517
Oh.

1341
01:26:02,000 --> 01:26:03,831
I can't.

1342
01:26:24,560 --> 01:26:27,154
- What's this?
- It's a wedding invitation.

1343
01:26:27,280 --> 01:26:30,955
Wait a minute.
This is your wedding invitation.

1344
01:26:31,080 --> 01:26:33,196
So?

1345
01:26:33,320 --> 01:26:35,151
Whom are we marrying?

1346
01:26:35,280 --> 01:26:38,078
Jerry, Peter Callaghan.

1347
01:26:38,200 --> 01:26:40,760
The coma guy?
Are you insane?

1348
01:26:40,880 --> 01:26:42,279
Yes, Jerry, I'm insane.

1349
01:26:42,400 --> 01:26:45,551
Every day I go and I sit
in a booth like a veal.

1350
01:26:45,680 --> 01:26:48,911
I, I work every holiday.
I go home to a cat.

1351
01:26:49,040 --> 01:26:53,352
And now a rich and handsome man
has asked me to marry him,
and I have said yes.

1352
01:26:53,480 --> 01:26:56,358
Okay, okay. That makes me
a raving, total lunatic.

1353
01:26:56,480 --> 01:26:58,710
The wedding
is tomorrow, Lucy.

1354
01:26:58,840 --> 01:27:01,752
I know it's tomorrow, Jerry.
But you know what?
I even wish it were yesterday.

1355
01:27:01,880 --> 01:27:05,077
Because you know what?
That would mean that today
that I would be on my honeymoon,

1356
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:07,270
that I would finally have
a stamp in my passport,

1357
01:27:07,400 --> 01:27:10,631
and that it would say
Italy on it!

1358
01:27:12,880 --> 01:27:14,677
What happened
with the other guy?

1359
01:27:17,200 --> 01:27:19,156
He didn't want me.

1360
01:27:31,800 --> 01:27:34,712
- Maybe she forgot.
- A woman doesn't forget
her wedding day.

1361
01:27:34,840 --> 01:27:36,637
Maybe she's stuck in traffic.

1362
01:27:36,760 --> 01:27:38,273
This isn't... This looks...
Does this look ridiculous?

1363
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,072
- No, you look fine.
- All right. All right.

1364
01:27:40,200 --> 01:27:42,077
- Well, you got the rings?
- Yeah, I got the rings.

1365
01:27:42,200 --> 01:27:44,395
What's the matter
with you, Jack?

1366
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:46,476
You suck.

1367
01:27:48,840 --> 01:27:51,035
I suck, or the outfit sucks?

1368
01:27:51,160 --> 01:27:52,639
It's a toss-up.

1369
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:54,318
What do you need?

1370
01:27:56,720 --> 01:27:59,792
- Oh.
- Oh. Here she is.

1371
01:28:05,640 --> 01:28:07,596
She's just a little nervous.

1372
01:28:07,720 --> 01:28:09,517
You're not kiddin'.

1373
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:25,556
She's lovely.

1374
01:28:48,280 --> 01:28:51,670
Dearly beloved, we are
gathered here today to join...

1375
01:28:51,800 --> 01:28:53,995
I object.

1376
01:28:54,120 --> 01:28:55,553
Oh, gee...

1377
01:28:55,680 --> 01:28:58,478
I, I, I didn't
get to that part yet.

1378
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:01,831
I would have to object too.

1379
01:29:01,960 --> 01:29:04,838
- What about you?
- Oh, I'm... I'm thinking.

1380
01:29:04,960 --> 01:29:06,916
What the hell is going on?

1381
01:29:11,880 --> 01:29:13,791
I am in love with your son.

1382
01:29:13,920 --> 01:29:15,592
I know.

1383
01:29:15,720 --> 01:29:19,349
Not that one. That one.

1384
01:29:20,920 --> 01:29:23,150
Jack, what the hell did you do?

1385
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:26,352
He didn't do anything.
He didn't do anything.

1386
01:29:26,480 --> 01:29:29,313
It was me. It was all me.

1387
01:29:29,440 --> 01:29:31,431
Um, Elsie, how you doin'?
You doin' okay?

1388
01:29:33,480 --> 01:29:36,552
Um, do you remember
that day at the hospital?

1389
01:29:36,680 --> 01:29:40,275
Of course you remember that day
at the hospital. Well, um,
there was a little mix-up.

1390
01:29:40,400 --> 01:29:45,474
Um, I saw Peter get pushed onto
the tracks, and, uh, I saved his life.

1391
01:29:45,600 --> 01:29:48,637
But when I got to the hospital,
they wouldn't let me see him.

1392
01:29:48,760 --> 01:29:54,198
So, um, the... someone told the
doctor that I was his fiancee.

1393
01:29:54,320 --> 01:29:59,075
Only, um... Oh.
It's not true.

1394
01:30:01,600 --> 01:30:05,115
I was never engaged to Peter.

1395
01:30:10,160 --> 01:30:12,799
Why didn't you
say something?

1396
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:16,230
Because I didn't know
how to tell you.

1397
01:30:16,360 --> 01:30:18,794
We never even met until
that day on the tracks.

1398
01:30:18,920 --> 01:30:23,277
And, um, it's just when we
were in the hospital room,
everything happened so fast.

1399
01:30:23,400 --> 01:30:25,391
And I couldn't tell you
the truth.

1400
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:29,433
And then I didn't wanna
tell you the truth because, um,

1401
01:30:29,560 --> 01:30:33,917
the truth was that
I fell in love with you.

1402
01:30:34,040 --> 01:30:36,031
You fell in love with me?

1403
01:30:36,160 --> 01:30:40,438
No. No... Yes.
All of you.

1404
01:30:40,560 --> 01:30:43,836
I went from being all alone
to being...

1405
01:30:43,960 --> 01:30:46,952
a fiancee, a daughter,

1406
01:30:47,080 --> 01:30:48,877
a granddaughter,
a sister...

1407
01:30:50,520 --> 01:30:52,909
and a friend.

1408
01:30:53,040 --> 01:30:54,837
I might have saved your life
on the tracks that day.

1409
01:30:54,960 --> 01:30:58,236
But you know what?
You really saved mine.

1410
01:30:58,360 --> 01:31:00,590
You allowed me to be
a part of your family,

1411
01:31:00,720 --> 01:31:03,280
and I haven't had that
in a really long time.

1412
01:31:05,240 --> 01:31:07,515
And I just didn't want
to let go of that.

1413
01:31:10,480 --> 01:31:13,995
So even though it was just for a little
while, I will love them always.

1414
01:31:18,320 --> 01:31:20,595
I'm very sorry.

1415
01:31:22,240 --> 01:31:26,518
Oh, um, and I'm very sorry
about your carpet.

1416
01:31:29,520 --> 01:31:31,476
What about my carpet?

1417
01:31:31,600 --> 01:31:33,875
- Peter Callaghan is engaged to me!
- Oh!

1418
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:36,639
- I object to this wedding.
- Get in line.

1419
01:31:36,760 --> 01:31:38,557
And I object to your objection.

1420
01:31:38,680 --> 01:31:40,955
- Who's that?
- Ashley's husband.

1421
01:31:41,080 --> 01:31:43,594
You proposed to
a married woman?

1422
01:31:43,720 --> 01:31:46,518
Yes. And I was in a coma
when my brother makes a play...

1423
01:31:46,640 --> 01:31:49,200
for my... sort of my fiancee.

1424
01:31:49,320 --> 01:31:52,756
- Peter, how could you do this?
- You promised me.

1425
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:55,348
We were better off together.

1426
01:32:01,560 --> 01:32:03,994
Hold on, hold on.
Just hold on right there.

1427
01:32:26,640 --> 01:32:31,270
Hey, Luce, I just wanted
to say that, uh,

1428
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:34,995
I'm sorry things didn't
work out with that guy.

1429
01:32:35,120 --> 01:32:38,430
And, um, you know,
right now...

1430
01:32:38,560 --> 01:32:42,838
you should get in touch
with the child within, and, um,

1431
01:32:42,960 --> 01:32:47,158
explore your feminine side,
and, um,

1432
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:50,511
you know, don't start eatin' cookies
and cake and stuff like that,

1433
01:32:50,640 --> 01:32:54,758
because you'll blow up
like my Aunt Roberta, you know.

1434
01:32:54,880 --> 01:32:58,953
And... You deserve
better than that.

1435
01:33:00,080 --> 01:33:01,911
So...

1436
01:33:06,480 --> 01:33:09,950
So, um, how are things goin'
with, uh, Miss Third Floor?

1437
01:33:11,160 --> 01:33:12,957
She's...

1438
01:33:15,520 --> 01:33:18,318
Oh, Joey. Joey.

1439
01:33:18,920 --> 01:33:20,319
Hmm?

1440
01:33:20,440 --> 01:33:22,829
- Do you have any cookies?
- No.

1441
01:33:22,960 --> 01:33:24,837
You know what? We can
try on some of my shoes.

1442
01:33:24,960 --> 01:33:26,791
- Okay.
- All right.

1443
01:33:33,840 --> 01:33:35,193
- Hey.
- Hmm?

1444
01:33:35,320 --> 01:33:38,471
- Last day, huh?
- Yeah, hmph.

1445
01:33:38,600 --> 01:33:40,511
- I'm sure gonna miss you.
- I'm gonna miss you.

1446
01:33:40,640 --> 01:33:42,153
- Oh, we'll see each other.
- You better.

1447
01:33:42,280 --> 01:33:43,633
- Of course.
- All right?
- All right.

1448
01:33:43,760 --> 01:33:45,079
- All right.
- Bye.

1449
01:33:45,200 --> 01:33:46,997
See ya.

1450
01:34:01,480 --> 01:34:02,629
Lucy.

1451
01:34:12,800 --> 01:34:15,075
I need to ask ya a question.

1452
01:34:15,200 --> 01:34:19,478
Get down on your knee.
It's more romantic.

1453
01:34:19,600 --> 01:34:21,636
He's proposing!
Let him do it.

1454
01:34:21,760 --> 01:34:24,558
I am letting him do it.

1455
01:34:29,360 --> 01:34:31,999
Can I come in there, please?

1456
01:34:33,280 --> 01:34:34,679
I can't.

1457
01:34:37,440 --> 01:34:39,476
Not without a token.

1458
01:34:50,640 --> 01:34:52,437
He's doin' it!

1459
01:34:52,560 --> 01:34:54,357
You knew?
How'd you know this?

1460
01:34:58,200 --> 01:35:00,031
Marry me?

1461
01:35:00,160 --> 01:35:02,435
Yeah.

1462
01:35:02,560 --> 01:35:04,630
I love you.

1463
01:35:04,760 --> 01:35:06,751
I love you back.

1464
01:35:11,440 --> 01:35:13,271
Ah, that's nice.

1465
01:35:13,400 --> 01:35:15,231
I'm so happy.

1466
01:35:28,680 --> 01:35:33,913
So, I had planned to marry Peter,
but I married Jack instead.

1467
01:35:34,040 --> 01:35:35,837
Thank goodness
my father was right.

1468
01:35:35,960 --> 01:35:38,554
Life doesn't always turn out
the way you plan.

1469
01:35:40,240 --> 01:35:44,199
But Jack, Jack gave me
the perfect gift:

1470
01:35:44,320 --> 01:35:46,356
A stamp in my passport.

1471
01:35:46,480 --> 01:35:49,392
He took me to Florence
for our honeymoon.

1472
01:35:49,520 --> 01:35:53,115
I guess you might say
he gave me the world.

1473
01:35:53,240 --> 01:35:56,630
Peter once asked me when it was
that I fell in love with Jack,

1474
01:35:56,760 --> 01:36:01,390
and I told him, "It was
while you were sleeping."

1475
01:36:21,480 --> 01:36:23,391
When my world is turnin'

1476
01:36:23,520 --> 01:36:27,149
When it's turnin'
upside down

1477
01:36:28,920 --> 01:36:31,957
When all I see is rain

1478
01:36:34,120 --> 01:36:36,509
When I think
the night won't end

1479
01:36:36,640 --> 01:36:39,950
I just think of you

1480
01:36:41,240 --> 01:36:44,437
And I can see
the sun again

1481
01:36:46,240 --> 01:36:50,518
Ooh, wherever would I be

1482
01:36:50,640 --> 01:36:52,995
Without ya

1483
01:36:53,120 --> 01:36:56,351
- If I didn't have you
- If I didn't have you

1484
01:36:56,480 --> 01:36:59,950
Whatever would
I do now, baby

1485
01:37:00,080 --> 01:37:04,596
Wherever would I be
without ya

1486
01:37:04,720 --> 01:37:07,757
- I'd be nowhere
- Nowhere

1487
01:37:07,880 --> 01:37:11,839
- I'd be nowhere
- Nowhere

1488
01:37:11,960 --> 01:37:14,428
When the dreams I dream
all seem

1489
01:37:14,560 --> 01:37:17,836
A million miles away

1490
01:37:19,160 --> 01:37:22,277
When I'm sure
I'll never win

1491
01:37:24,680 --> 01:37:27,638
When it's lookin' like
I lost my faith

1492
01:37:27,760 --> 01:37:31,469
- I just look at you, baby
- Baby

1493
01:37:31,600 --> 01:37:35,798
And I got reason
to believe again

1494
01:37:35,920 --> 01:37:40,914
Ooh, wherever would I be

1495
01:37:41,040 --> 01:37:42,996
Without ya

1496
01:37:43,120 --> 01:37:46,795
- If I didn't have you
- Ooh, if I didn't have you

1497
01:37:46,920 --> 01:37:50,435
Whatever would
I do now, baby

1498
01:37:50,560 --> 01:37:55,031
Wherever would I be
without ya

1499
01:37:55,160 --> 01:37:58,311
- I'd be nowhere
- I'd be nowhere

1500
01:37:58,440 --> 01:38:01,352
- I'd be nowhere
- Nowhere

1501
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:04,870
Without you

1502
01:38:05,000 --> 01:38:07,833
- To love me
- To love me

1503
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:10,872
Just be wastin' time

1504
01:38:11,000 --> 01:38:16,996
- Goin' out of my mind
- My mind

1505
01:38:17,120 --> 01:38:22,752
Wherever would I be
without you

1506
01:38:22,880 --> 01:38:26,156
- If I didn't have you
- If I didn't have you

1507
01:38:26,280 --> 01:38:29,875
Whatever would
I do now, baby

1508
01:38:30,000 --> 01:38:34,471
Wherever would I be
without you

1509
01:38:34,600 --> 01:38:37,034
- I'd be nowhere
- Nowhere
- I'd be nowhere

1510
01:38:37,160 --> 01:38:42,598
- Nowhere
- Nowhere
- Oh, oh, oh

1511
01:38:42,720 --> 01:38:46,713
- Wherever would I be
without you
- Wherever would I be

1512
01:38:46,840 --> 01:38:48,319
- Wherever would I be
- Baby

1513
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:51,637
- If I didn't have you
- If I didn't have you

1514
01:38:51,760 --> 01:38:54,513
Wherever would
I be now, baby

1515
01:38:54,640 --> 01:38:56,756
If I didn't have you
