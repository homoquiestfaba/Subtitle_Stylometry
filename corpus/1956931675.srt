1
00:00:06,506 --> 00:00:08,508
You know the fairy tale
about the princess

2
00:00:08,591 --> 00:00:11,094
waiting for some brave prince
to come and save her?

3
00:00:12,262 --> 00:00:14,806
Yeah, this is not that kind of a story.

4
00:00:14,889 --> 00:00:16,641
Meet Samantha.

5
00:00:16,725 --> 00:00:20,311
She's the second-born daughter
of the royal family of Illyria,

6
00:00:20,395 --> 00:00:22,022
the smallest country in Europe.

7
00:00:22,105 --> 00:00:24,274
See? That one right there.

8
00:00:24,816 --> 00:00:27,360
Sam, here,
has never been a typical princess.

9
00:00:27,444 --> 00:00:29,487
Unlike her older sister, Eleanor,

10
00:00:29,571 --> 00:00:32,240
who always seemed perfectly regal
in every way,

11
00:00:32,323 --> 00:00:34,242
Sam wasn't.

12
00:00:35,702 --> 00:00:40,081
Things got even tougher when, at age
five, she found out her father, the king,

13
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:42,876
had died in a plane crash
with his brother.

14
00:00:43,543 --> 00:00:47,756
After that, Sam's mom took over the throne
and the job of running the country.

15
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:51,926
But in a few weeks,
Eleanor, the rightful heir,

16
00:00:52,010 --> 00:00:54,637
will turn 18,
and she'll become the Queen of Illyria.

17
00:00:58,224 --> 00:01:01,895
As for Sam, she's just never fit
into this royal world.

18
00:01:05,231 --> 00:01:09,152
She's like so many second-borns
just searching for her place.

19
00:01:10,236 --> 00:01:12,280
You see, Sam's destined for great things.

20
00:01:12,364 --> 00:01:13,865
She just doesn't know it yet.

21
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:16,534
That's where I come in.

22
00:01:20,455 --> 00:01:23,708
But... we'll get there soon enough.

23
00:01:39,641 --> 00:01:40,642
We're almost there.

24
00:01:41,101 --> 00:01:43,186
Good, 'cause this gear is not light.

25
00:01:43,269 --> 00:01:44,688
Tell me about it.

26
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:46,523
Hey, are you sure you wanna do this?

27
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:48,608
-Last chance to turn back.
- Of course I'm sure.

28
00:01:48,692 --> 00:01:50,568
You sound like my mom.

29
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,278
Come on.

30
00:01:52,946 --> 00:01:55,949
Do you know how many people
would kill to be royalty? I would.

31
00:01:56,032 --> 00:01:57,617
You so do not mean that.

32
00:01:57,951 --> 00:01:59,911
You can do whatever you want
with your life.

33
00:01:59,994 --> 00:02:02,205
You can just be yourself.

34
00:02:02,997 --> 00:02:05,667
My entire future is planned out for me.

35
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,503
Second-borns are supposed
to host cocktail parties

36
00:02:08,586 --> 00:02:11,965
and cut ribbons
and smile silently in the background.

37
00:02:12,590 --> 00:02:13,842
It's not me.

38
00:02:13,925 --> 00:02:15,802
I wanna do something that matters.

39
00:02:16,261 --> 00:02:17,345
Makes sense to me.

40
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:25,186
-Hello, Illyria.
-

41
00:02:25,270 --> 00:02:27,355
We are here because we want change.

42
00:02:27,439 --> 00:02:28,565
Down with the monarchy.

43
00:02:28,648 --> 00:02:29,983
Give us freedom.

44
00:02:30,066 --> 00:02:32,068
We demand a voice. A choice.

45
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:35,321
If you agree with us,
make some noise. Hit it!

46
00:02:50,086 --> 00:02:52,756
And what you need

47
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:55,759
It's time that everybody speak

48
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,636
To see what we see

49
00:03:13,276 --> 00:03:16,613
-

50
00:03:17,155 --> 00:03:18,948
-Do you hear that?
-What?

51
00:03:19,616 --> 00:03:22,494
We gotta go. You get the gear.
I'll distract the cops.

52
00:03:26,915 --> 00:03:28,333
Hey, hey, hey! Get back here!

53
00:03:49,979 --> 00:03:51,356
88-14 clear.

54
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,241
-Leave us.
-Your Majesty.

55
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,286
Hey, Mom.

56
00:04:06,162 --> 00:04:07,163
Again, Samantha?

57
00:04:08,456 --> 00:04:10,875
You're in here
planning Eleanor's coronation,

58
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:13,003
but out there people are unhappy.

59
00:04:13,086 --> 00:04:17,257
No, some people, about 30 of them.
It's a flash mob, not a majority.

60
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:19,009
-The rest are content.
-Really?

61
00:04:19,092 --> 00:04:21,344
Hate it or not, you are a princess,

62
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:24,055
and if you could just stop rebelling
against that,

63
00:04:24,139 --> 00:04:27,392
you might realize that
it's actually a pretty cool opportunity.

64
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,477
Whatever. I gotta go to school.

65
00:04:30,812 --> 00:04:32,272
Don't forget to wash your face.

66
00:04:32,355 --> 00:04:34,315
I'm 15. I don't need to be told--

67
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:39,612
Thanks.

68
00:04:50,206 --> 00:04:51,958
Good morning, young royals.

69
00:04:52,042 --> 00:04:55,879
Summer break is almost here,
but not quite yet. Get to class.

70
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,013
So, Gwenyth124 asked me why I
was spending my summer vacation in Haiti.

71
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:09,142
And it's because I saw this video
of these adorable, unfortunate orphans.

72
00:05:09,225 --> 00:05:12,312
They were caught in a mudslide, and I just
knew that I had to do something, you know?

73
00:05:12,395 --> 00:05:13,897
I got to go. Love. Bye.

74
00:05:16,608 --> 00:05:18,026
It wasn't a mudslide.

75
00:05:18,902 --> 00:05:22,739
It was a 7.0 earthquake
followed by a Category 4 hurricane.

76
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,450
Yes, a hurricane that caused a mudslide.

77
00:05:25,533 --> 00:05:28,370
And, besides, I don't think it really
matters why the Haitians are suffering.

78
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,330
The point is that I'm there
to do something about it.

79
00:05:30,413 --> 00:05:32,749
-Which is what exactly?
-Oh, I'm building an orphanage.

80
00:05:32,832 --> 00:05:35,168
Will you be carrying bricks,
pouring concrete?

81
00:05:35,251 --> 00:05:37,420
I'm a princess. I'm bringing awareness.

82
00:05:37,504 --> 00:05:39,464
To Haiti, or to yourself?

83
00:05:39,839 --> 00:05:42,676
Listen, this is more
than you've ever done for anyone.

84
00:05:43,218 --> 00:05:46,680
You just walk around hating on
the monarchy and embarrassing your family.

85
00:05:46,763 --> 00:05:49,933
Your sister must be so ashamed
to be related to you.

86
00:05:51,476 --> 00:05:54,729
That's why I have 106 million friends,
and you have none.

87
00:06:03,279 --> 00:06:05,031
Level four
is the worst of the worst.

88
00:06:05,657 --> 00:06:07,617
The most notorious criminals in the world.

89
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,911
Inmates ordinary prisons
aren't equipped to handle.

90
00:06:09,994 --> 00:06:13,123
-What's on level five?
-We call him Inmate 34.

91
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:18,461
All this for one guy? Who is he?

92
00:06:18,837 --> 00:06:20,714
Don't know. I'm not sure I want to.

93
00:08:13,952 --> 00:08:16,037
That was good.
Still think we can do better.

94
00:08:16,121 --> 00:08:18,915
Well, now that it's summer,
we've got way more time to practice.

95
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:22,544
No more school.
No more Roxana, Princess von Selfie.

96
00:08:22,627 --> 00:08:24,629
Oh, it's so cool she's going to Haiti.

97
00:08:27,340 --> 00:08:28,341
Thank you.

98
00:08:28,425 --> 00:08:31,052
Look, the point is,
we have our first paid gig coming up,

99
00:08:31,136 --> 00:08:33,138
and for us to be ready, we need to focus.

100
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:36,516
Oh, I am focused. It is going to be
the highlight of my summer.

101
00:08:36,599 --> 00:08:38,268
Not necessarily.

102
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,354
To celebrate your release from Strathmore
School for the Incredibly Entitled

103
00:08:41,438 --> 00:08:44,190
and mine from Illyria Public,
I got us tickets to...

104
00:08:45,859 --> 00:08:48,445
-I'm not worthy.

105
00:08:48,987 --> 00:08:52,157
-Your dad's gonna let you go?
-Well, he's working all night.

106
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:54,617
Luckily, coronations
keep a groundskeeper very busy.

107
00:08:54,701 --> 00:08:55,910
I will see you there.

108
00:08:56,953 --> 00:08:58,997
Oh, and you might want to brush
your teeth.

109
00:08:59,080 --> 00:09:01,207
I can smell
the garlic naan you had for lunch.

110
00:09:02,709 --> 00:09:05,045
That was... two days ago.

111
00:09:06,588 --> 00:09:07,589
Uh...

112
00:09:51,716 --> 00:09:54,511
Did you know
that every snowflake is unique...

113
00:09:55,512 --> 00:10:00,141
each with its imperfections and flaws?

114
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:02,310
That's what makes them so special.

115
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,105
You're my snowflake, Sam.

116
00:10:06,481 --> 00:10:07,482
Samantha!

117
00:10:09,693 --> 00:10:12,112
Why aren't you ready? We're gonna be late.

118
00:10:12,987 --> 00:10:14,280
Late for what?

119
00:10:18,243 --> 00:10:20,662
Thank you,
Illyrian foreign press.

120
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:25,417
Thank you so much for coming.

121
00:10:26,918 --> 00:10:28,503
Hey. You look wonderful.

122
00:10:28,586 --> 00:10:30,046
Thank you for coming.

123
00:10:30,964 --> 00:10:33,049
I apologize for being late.

124
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:34,634
It's not your fault.

125
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:36,928
You know,
the Queen does have the authority

126
00:10:37,012 --> 00:10:39,806
to imprison someone for tardiness.

127
00:10:39,889 --> 00:10:41,683
Well, you're not the queen yet.

128
00:10:41,766 --> 00:10:42,851
Four weeks.

129
00:10:42,934 --> 00:10:44,269
I can hardly wait.

130
00:10:44,352 --> 00:10:47,647
And if being in a dungeon means
I don't have to wear this dress, then--

131
00:10:47,731 --> 00:10:48,857
A photo of Your Majesties?

132
00:10:53,194 --> 00:10:54,279
-Thank you.
-

133
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:04,330
I gotta go.

134
00:11:04,414 --> 00:11:07,959
I have a huge headache
and a massive history final tomorrow.

135
00:11:08,043 --> 00:11:09,044
Your Highness,

136
00:11:09,502 --> 00:11:10,628
Duke Heresford.

137
00:11:11,921 --> 00:11:14,215
Straight home. Study and sleep.

138
00:11:14,299 --> 00:11:15,300
Thank you.

139
00:11:31,274 --> 00:11:32,275
Have a good prom.

140
00:11:46,623 --> 00:11:48,875
-Boo!
-Finally. I thought you ghosted me.

141
00:11:48,958 --> 00:11:51,294
It's Bramblebone.
Nothing in the world could stop me.

142
00:11:51,795 --> 00:11:52,796
IDs?

143
00:11:55,382 --> 00:11:58,093
I can't believe this.
Must be a new rule.

144
00:11:59,552 --> 00:12:01,554
How was I supposed to know
that they card now?

145
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:14,734
-Come on. I have an idea.

146
00:12:19,114 --> 00:12:21,241
-

147
00:12:21,324 --> 00:12:23,410
Wha-- How did you do that?

148
00:12:23,952 --> 00:12:25,495
I saw the guy enter the code.

149
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,996
Right. Yeah, that totally makes sense.

150
00:12:27,080 --> 00:12:29,082
You could see those tiny numbers
from super far away.

151
00:12:29,165 --> 00:12:31,251
Which brings me back to,
how did you do that?

152
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:33,670
I don't know. It's weird.

153
00:12:34,963 --> 00:12:36,464
Let's go. They're playing a new song.

154
00:12:47,976 --> 00:12:49,811
It's so good!
- I love this song!

155
00:13:10,457 --> 00:13:11,791
What's wrong?

156
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:12,917
I'm fine.

157
00:13:20,133 --> 00:13:23,261
-

158
00:13:37,776 --> 00:13:38,818
Are you okay?

159
00:13:39,402 --> 00:13:40,862
I need to make it stop.

160
00:13:41,529 --> 00:13:43,782
-

161
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:54,084
What was that?
We've been Bramble-banned for life.

162
00:13:54,167 --> 00:13:55,377
I don't know.

163
00:13:56,211 --> 00:14:00,674
It was like I was hearing every
single sound in the club all at once.

164
00:14:00,757 --> 00:14:02,759
Even the wings on a fly.

165
00:14:03,635 --> 00:14:04,886
It sounds crazy.

166
00:14:04,969 --> 00:14:06,596
Well, not coming from the girl

167
00:14:06,680 --> 00:14:09,349
who can make out the numbers on a keypad
from across the street

168
00:14:09,432 --> 00:14:11,851
and smell what I had for lunch
two days ago.

169
00:14:11,935 --> 00:14:13,395
Maybe I have a brain tumor.

170
00:14:13,978 --> 00:14:15,480
You don't have a brain tumor, Sam.

171
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:25,448
You know what I thought
when I first saw you ten years ago?

172
00:14:26,282 --> 00:14:28,827
Why is she hot-wiring my dad's tractor?

173
00:14:31,371 --> 00:14:33,206
That you were gonna be my best friend.

174
00:14:33,289 --> 00:14:35,959
Although, the hot-wiring thing was--
It's pretty sick.

175
00:14:39,462 --> 00:14:41,881
I'm here for you, Sam.
Everything's gonna be okay.

176
00:14:42,799 --> 00:14:43,842
You're gonna be fine.

177
00:14:49,389 --> 00:14:51,516
-This sucks.
- I'm sorry.

178
00:14:55,812 --> 00:14:56,813
-

179
00:14:59,607 --> 00:15:01,234
Hey... Dad!

180
00:15:03,611 --> 00:15:04,988
You missed your history final.

181
00:15:05,071 --> 00:15:06,740
Professor Blake will let me make it up.

182
00:15:06,823 --> 00:15:09,075
No one will know anything about
what happened last night,

183
00:15:09,159 --> 00:15:11,453
especially not my... mom.

184
00:15:17,334 --> 00:15:20,420
You knew? And you let me
spend the night in jail?

185
00:15:20,503 --> 00:15:22,005
Actions have consequences.

186
00:15:22,088 --> 00:15:24,716
It's a miracle the only casualty
was the band's sound system,

187
00:15:24,799 --> 00:15:26,217
which is coming out of your allowance.

188
00:15:26,301 --> 00:15:27,886
Of course.
-I spoke to Professor Blake.

189
00:15:27,969 --> 00:15:30,138
He'll let you make up the final
by attending summer school.

190
00:15:30,221 --> 00:15:32,265
-No way!
-Very much "way."

191
00:15:32,349 --> 00:15:34,309
You'll live on campus. No distractions.

192
00:15:34,392 --> 00:15:35,518
Am I clear?

193
00:15:36,186 --> 00:15:37,812
Good. Go pack.

194
00:15:39,105 --> 00:15:40,523
-School starts...
-Tomorrow?

195
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:41,524
I know.

196
00:15:41,608 --> 00:15:43,651
Guess I can't complain
about being grounded for the weekend.

197
00:15:43,735 --> 00:15:44,819
So much for our first gig.

198
00:15:44,903 --> 00:15:46,738
I will find a way to escape.

199
00:15:47,364 --> 00:15:48,948
-Oh. I gotta go.

200
00:15:49,032 --> 00:15:50,867
The person of the year
just walked into my room.

201
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:52,035
Okay, bye.

202
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:54,704
-I came to say goodbye.
-You mean good riddance?

203
00:15:55,622 --> 00:15:57,248
The next time we see each other--

204
00:15:57,332 --> 00:15:59,876
You'll be Queen.
Like you've always wanted.

205
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:03,463
I wish you could be happy for me.

206
00:16:03,922 --> 00:16:05,131
I want to.

207
00:16:05,674 --> 00:16:09,010
But I don't understand
how any of this can make you happy.

208
00:16:09,552 --> 00:16:11,221
Always being on display.

209
00:16:11,513 --> 00:16:14,265
Being told exactly how to be.

210
00:16:14,349 --> 00:16:15,350
We're royals.

211
00:16:16,309 --> 00:16:17,894
That's our job.

212
00:16:19,479 --> 00:16:21,564
I know it makes sense to you.

213
00:16:22,857 --> 00:16:24,484
It just never has for me.

214
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:31,116
Maybe someday it will.

215
00:16:51,469 --> 00:16:52,470
Hello?

216
00:16:54,222 --> 00:16:55,348
I'm free.

217
00:16:56,182 --> 00:16:58,893
The apple was a very clever idea.

218
00:17:01,646 --> 00:17:02,897
Stick to the plan.

219
00:17:04,190 --> 00:17:06,317
Phase one begins tomorrow.

220
00:17:27,213 --> 00:17:30,342
Summer school students,
please report to room 203.

221
00:17:39,809 --> 00:17:40,810
Hi, there.

222
00:17:42,228 --> 00:17:43,605
Uh, hi, there.

223
00:17:43,688 --> 00:17:44,939
Heard you the first time.

224
00:17:45,023 --> 00:17:46,775
Oh, I wasn't sure.

225
00:17:46,858 --> 00:17:49,444
I'm January.
I'm Palace School back in Luxembourg.

226
00:17:49,527 --> 00:17:51,946
Just here for the extra credit.
You must be Sam.

227
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:53,656
Our royal families go way back.

228
00:17:53,740 --> 00:17:57,077
My dad was friends with your uncle.
I heard Strathmore is the best.

229
00:17:57,160 --> 00:17:58,161
It sucks.

230
00:17:58,912 --> 00:17:59,954
You'll love it.

231
00:18:00,038 --> 00:18:01,581
Uh, thanks, I guess.

232
00:18:02,749 --> 00:18:04,459
-So...
-Look, June--

233
00:18:04,542 --> 00:18:06,419
-January.
- Whatever.

234
00:18:06,503 --> 00:18:10,507
You seem like a perfectly typical princess
who's genuinely excited to be here.

235
00:18:10,590 --> 00:18:13,718
I just figured since we were
the only two people in the class...

236
00:18:15,762 --> 00:18:17,972
Oh, hi. I didn't notice you.

237
00:18:18,056 --> 00:18:20,100
-I'm January, this is--
-Sam.

238
00:18:20,517 --> 00:18:21,518
I'm Matteo.

239
00:18:22,519 --> 00:18:23,520
Nice to meet you--

240
00:18:23,603 --> 00:18:25,480
What's up, breakfast club?

241
00:18:25,563 --> 00:18:28,400
So, this is Strathmore?
My fourth school in three months.

242
00:18:28,942 --> 00:18:30,777
Bad news, you're stuck here.

243
00:18:31,486 --> 00:18:33,154
Good news, you're stuck here with me.

244
00:18:34,155 --> 00:18:36,199
How exactly is that "good news"?

245
00:18:36,282 --> 00:18:37,659
'Cause I bring the party, Joan of Dark.

246
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:38,993
Drop dead, Fresh Prince.

247
00:18:39,077 --> 00:18:42,080
It's all right. She'll come
around. I tend to grow on people.

248
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:43,498
-Like fungus?
-Yeah.

249
00:18:43,581 --> 00:18:46,209
It's so good to see you guys.

250
00:18:46,292 --> 00:18:48,503
All 108 million of you.

251
00:18:49,170 --> 00:18:53,299
Thank you, Evil Kitten, and no, I'm not
looking forward to summer school either.

252
00:18:53,383 --> 00:18:54,384
But I am a survivor.

253
00:18:56,469 --> 00:18:58,013
Right, gotta run. Loves.

254
00:18:59,514 --> 00:19:00,890
I can't believe this is happening.

255
00:19:00,974 --> 00:19:02,434
Fourteen days of unexcused absence.

256
00:19:02,517 --> 00:19:04,811
I mean,
I Skyped in every day from Coachella.

257
00:19:07,188 --> 00:19:10,567
I didn't know you could be sent to
summer school for having no fashion sense.

258
00:19:10,650 --> 00:19:12,235
-Go mute yourself.
-Ouch.

259
00:19:13,028 --> 00:19:15,655
Hi, Roxana.
I'm a really big fan.

260
00:19:15,739 --> 00:19:18,283
I'm January, and I can't wait
to get to know all of you better.

261
00:19:18,366 --> 00:19:19,743
Well, I'll give you the CliffsNotes.

262
00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,661
She's the most annoying person in school,

263
00:19:21,745 --> 00:19:24,998
and Prince Tuma over here,
is a total jerk.

264
00:19:25,081 --> 00:19:27,792
He dated my BFF,
and all he cares about is himself.

265
00:19:27,876 --> 00:19:29,544
And all you care about
is what filter you use.

266
00:19:29,627 --> 00:19:31,796
I've always been no filter,
and everyone knows that.

267
00:19:31,880 --> 00:19:34,299
Where's the rest of the class?
There can't only be four of us.

268
00:19:34,382 --> 00:19:36,217
-Five.
- Good morning, class.

269
00:19:36,301 --> 00:19:39,304
My name's Mr. Morrow,
but you can call me James.

270
00:19:39,387 --> 00:19:41,848
Yup, this is me.
Your loyal royal narrator.

271
00:19:41,931 --> 00:19:43,767
I bet you were wondering
when I'd show up.

272
00:19:43,850 --> 00:19:45,101
Little bit about me.

273
00:19:45,185 --> 00:19:47,896
I have a boyfriend named Henry,
an iguana named Jeff,

274
00:19:47,979 --> 00:19:49,773
and a severe gluten allergy.

275
00:19:49,856 --> 00:19:52,359
Seriously, give me a bagel
and I'm as good as dead.

276
00:19:52,817 --> 00:19:55,528
We are going to have fun this summer.

277
00:19:55,612 --> 00:19:57,572
Oh, God. We got the "cool teacher."

278
00:19:57,655 --> 00:19:59,449
Thank you.
No one's ever called me cool before.

279
00:20:00,450 --> 00:20:02,786
This ain't my first rodeo.
You guys are in good hands.

280
00:20:02,869 --> 00:20:04,913
He definitely wasn't the cool teacher.

281
00:20:04,996 --> 00:20:07,665
Quick question for you.
Why do you think you're here?

282
00:20:07,749 --> 00:20:09,292
Oh, well, I threw a party.

283
00:20:09,376 --> 00:20:10,835
That doesn't sound bad.

284
00:20:10,919 --> 00:20:12,837
In the chem lab,
burned down half the school.

285
00:20:12,921 --> 00:20:14,381
-It wasn't my fault.
- Incorrect.

286
00:20:14,464 --> 00:20:16,424
Prince Matteo, same question.

287
00:20:16,508 --> 00:20:17,592
Um...

288
00:20:17,676 --> 00:20:19,803
My parents got a letter from school.

289
00:20:20,261 --> 00:20:22,972
My social skills are a bit lacking.

290
00:20:23,431 --> 00:20:26,142
The principal thought
a smaller class might help.

291
00:20:26,226 --> 00:20:28,520
Also, incorrect. Princess Samantha.

292
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:29,854
It's Sam,

293
00:20:29,938 --> 00:20:32,315
and I'm pretty sure anything I say
is gonna be wrong.

294
00:20:33,191 --> 00:20:35,610
Now, that is correct.

295
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:38,571
The reasons all of you
were sent to "summer school"

296
00:20:38,655 --> 00:20:42,409
were cover-up stories to get you
all here without arousing suspicion.

297
00:20:44,786 --> 00:20:45,704
I get it.

298
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:48,748
I'm on a reality TV show.

299
00:20:49,708 --> 00:20:50,709
Are you the host?

300
00:20:51,209 --> 00:20:53,169
Oh, no. Gosh. That's the dream, though.

301
00:20:53,753 --> 00:20:55,296
But, alas, I'm a prince.

302
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:57,465
A second-born royal, just like you guys.

303
00:20:57,549 --> 00:21:01,845
Our siblings are the heirs, we the spares.

304
00:21:02,637 --> 00:21:03,596
Powerless.

305
00:21:04,014 --> 00:21:05,015
Without purpose...

306
00:21:06,099 --> 00:21:07,767
or so everyone thinks.

307
00:21:10,895 --> 00:21:12,355
Dude, you're a hologram.

308
00:21:12,439 --> 00:21:15,108
They had one of Celine Dion performing
at my cousin's knighting ceremony.

309
00:21:15,191 --> 00:21:17,777
Maybe it's a twin brother?

310
00:21:24,117 --> 00:21:25,577
Okay, here's the deal.

311
00:21:25,660 --> 00:21:29,539
There's a special gene exclusive
to second-borns of royal bloodlines.

312
00:21:29,622 --> 00:21:32,375
A gene that gives some of us
extraordinary abilities

313
00:21:32,459 --> 00:21:34,294
that manifest at your age.

314
00:21:37,047 --> 00:21:38,381
You guys have superpowers.

315
00:21:38,882 --> 00:21:41,676
Your abilities are unique to you alone.

316
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:44,262
That is why you're here,

317
00:21:44,346 --> 00:21:46,389
to harness your untapped potential,

318
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:52,645
which you will use as members of
the Secret Society of Second-Born Royals.

319
00:21:57,025 --> 00:21:58,276
It's a mouthful, we know.

320
00:21:59,194 --> 00:22:02,197
we're superheroes?

321
00:22:02,781 --> 00:22:03,907
That's correct.

322
00:22:08,161 --> 00:22:09,621
There is one catch, though.

323
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:13,792
Nobody, even your family,
can know we exist.

324
00:22:13,875 --> 00:22:15,960
I've had that superpower for years.

325
00:22:16,378 --> 00:22:17,420
Dude, so sad.

326
00:22:18,296 --> 00:22:20,340
Now, to protect our secrecy,

327
00:22:20,423 --> 00:22:23,343
I'm going to have to take
all of your phones.

328
00:22:24,260 --> 00:22:27,138
I'm so sorry to confiscate your phones

329
00:22:27,222 --> 00:22:30,642
for the immediate
and not so temporary future.

330
00:22:31,142 --> 00:22:33,311
When you say, "the immediate
and not so temporary future,"

331
00:22:33,395 --> 00:22:35,647
you don't mean, like,
the whole summer, right?

332
00:22:36,606 --> 00:22:40,610
The pain you're experiencing right now
will only make you stronger.

333
00:22:41,403 --> 00:22:44,447
So, James,
are you the head of the Society?

334
00:22:44,531 --> 00:22:45,824
Not exactly.

335
00:22:45,907 --> 00:22:46,991
I am.

336
00:22:48,118 --> 00:22:49,119
Mom?

337
00:22:49,869 --> 00:22:52,706
Welcome to
the Secret Society training program.

338
00:22:53,665 --> 00:22:56,459
For thousands of years,
second-borns like you and myself

339
00:22:56,543 --> 00:23:01,131
have protected our kingdoms from threats,
assassins and international criminals.

340
00:23:01,881 --> 00:23:03,008
We work in secret.

341
00:23:03,508 --> 00:23:07,554
Our rewards? Lives saved. Order restored.

342
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:10,515
The next six weeks will be challenging.

343
00:23:10,890 --> 00:23:12,559
You may doubt you have what it takes,

344
00:23:13,101 --> 00:23:17,313
but whatever obstacles you face,
nothing is impossible.

345
00:23:17,731 --> 00:23:20,316
Those of you who make the cut
will join the Society.

346
00:23:20,817 --> 00:23:23,236
Those who don't
will return to your kingdoms.

347
00:23:23,319 --> 00:23:25,113
You'll be stripped of your powers,

348
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:28,867
and your memories will be modified to
erase any recollection of this training.

349
00:23:30,201 --> 00:23:31,578
I wish you the best of luck.

350
00:23:36,499 --> 00:23:37,500
You lied to me.

351
00:23:38,251 --> 00:23:40,962
I withheld the truth.
There's a difference.

352
00:23:41,046 --> 00:23:42,672
Did Dad know? Does El?

353
00:23:42,756 --> 00:23:46,843
No, and she'll never know.
That's how we protect those we love.

354
00:23:48,219 --> 00:23:49,054
How?

355
00:23:50,221 --> 00:23:54,642
You long to be more than a princess,
this meaningless title you were born with.

356
00:23:55,060 --> 00:23:56,144
This is your chance.

357
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:01,983
Go join the others and make me proud.

358
00:24:08,656 --> 00:24:10,992
What did you tell her?
- What she needed to hear.

359
00:24:11,076 --> 00:24:12,410
Any news on the prison break?

360
00:24:13,244 --> 00:24:14,454
He had help.

361
00:24:14,537 --> 00:24:17,999
Every Society operative around the world
is out searching. We'll find him.

362
00:24:31,930 --> 00:24:33,181
Do you have something for me?

363
00:24:33,264 --> 00:24:35,517
Not yet, but I'm working on it.

364
00:24:35,600 --> 00:24:39,479
Meanwhile, keep strengthening
your telekinesis. It's been a long time.

365
00:24:40,021 --> 00:24:43,358
I rotted in that cell Catherine put me in
for ten years...

366
00:24:44,025 --> 00:24:48,279
waiting to escape
while the world forgot I existed.

367
00:24:49,531 --> 00:24:52,450
Now I'm going to take everything from her.

368
00:24:53,785 --> 00:24:54,953
Ten years.

369
00:25:20,437 --> 00:25:22,355
Welcome, trainees.

370
00:25:22,439 --> 00:25:24,858
Now you're probably all wondering,
"What are my powers?"

371
00:25:24,941 --> 00:25:28,069
I'm wondering that myself,
but we will get to that.

372
00:25:28,153 --> 00:25:32,782
First, however, a little Secret Society
tradition for new trainees.

373
00:25:32,866 --> 00:25:36,745
You're gonna like it.
Actually, you might not like it.

374
00:25:36,828 --> 00:25:37,662
What's up?

375
00:25:37,746 --> 00:25:40,665
Does that involve push-ups?
I have a doctor's note for that.

376
00:25:41,833 --> 00:25:44,252
All right.
Yeah, you're definitely not gonna like it.

377
00:25:51,051 --> 00:25:54,137
No way. This is amazing!

378
00:26:06,858 --> 00:26:10,278
Super basic. All you gotta do
is get from here to there.

379
00:26:10,362 --> 00:26:12,822
First person who gets the pyramid
wins the prize.

380
00:26:12,906 --> 00:26:14,741
Piece of cake.

381
00:26:18,370 --> 00:26:20,789
Lesson one, expect the unexpected.

382
00:26:22,207 --> 00:26:24,709
Well, what are you waiting for,
a royal invitation? Let's go.

383
00:26:25,543 --> 00:26:26,753
FYI, the lasers hurt.

384
00:26:31,591 --> 00:26:32,425
Whoop.

385
00:26:32,967 --> 00:26:35,053
I'm going to beat you.
- You wish.

386
00:26:35,762 --> 00:26:37,347
Ah, you kids are really athletic.

387
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,197
Ow, I chipped a nail.

388
00:26:55,657 --> 00:26:58,243
Guys, I just lost my thumb.
I text with my thumb.

389
00:26:58,326 --> 00:27:00,120
Oh, my God. I'm melting.

390
00:27:00,203 --> 00:27:02,956
-That's your power. Invisibility.
-A-plus.

391
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:04,082
Can I have my legs back now?

392
00:27:04,165 --> 00:27:05,834
They're my second
most-commented-on feature.

393
00:27:05,917 --> 00:27:07,252
You just lost your bottom.

394
00:27:07,335 --> 00:27:09,754
Right, that's it. I'm out.

395
00:27:12,465 --> 00:27:13,633
Hey, forget her. Help me up.

396
00:27:14,342 --> 00:27:15,176
Coming.

397
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:16,511
So demanding.

398
00:27:17,345 --> 00:27:18,972
Figure out this course
and take me to the pyramid.

399
00:27:19,055 --> 00:27:20,890
Why do I suddenly care so much
about helping you?

400
00:27:20,974 --> 00:27:21,891
Because I'm charming.

401
00:27:21,975 --> 00:27:23,226
Not to anyone with a pulse.

402
00:27:25,770 --> 00:27:28,189
Maybe that's his power? He tells people
what to do, and they listen.

403
00:27:29,190 --> 00:27:31,234
Fine.
Tell me your most embarrassing secret.

404
00:27:31,317 --> 00:27:32,402
I've never kissed anyone.

405
00:27:33,445 --> 00:27:36,197
You see, I'd never admit that.
He can make people do whatever he says.

406
00:27:36,281 --> 00:27:37,323
Greatest power ever.

407
00:27:40,076 --> 00:27:41,077
Duck!

408
00:27:43,621 --> 00:27:46,374
Lesson two, be aware of your surroundings.

409
00:27:46,458 --> 00:27:49,836
It would be really useful
if you gave us the lessons beforehand.

410
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,629
Well, that would kinda defeat
the whole purpose, wouldn't it?

411
00:27:51,713 --> 00:27:54,132
A word of warning,
the lasers are still shooting.

412
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:55,216
How did you know?

413
00:27:55,300 --> 00:27:57,635
I heard it. I have super senses.

414
00:28:00,930 --> 00:28:01,931
Whoa!

415
00:28:02,015 --> 00:28:04,017
-How did you do that?
-The laser bounced off the padding.

416
00:28:05,935 --> 00:28:07,187
-

417
00:28:07,270 --> 00:28:08,104
Ow.

418
00:28:38,343 --> 00:28:40,136
Can I have my cell phone back, please?

419
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:42,972
-Well, that was a great success.
-

420
00:28:46,309 --> 00:28:48,228
Does anyone want to trade powers?

421
00:28:48,937 --> 00:28:52,190
Super senses for kind of invisibility?
I'm good.

422
00:28:53,525 --> 00:28:56,528
What about you, Matteo?
You're kind of invisible anyway.

423
00:28:57,028 --> 00:28:59,447
Sure. You can have my power
of being awkward

424
00:28:59,823 --> 00:29:01,074
'cause that's all I have right now.

425
00:29:03,284 --> 00:29:04,411
So many bugs.

426
00:29:04,494 --> 00:29:06,037
Maybe we're late bloomers.

427
00:29:06,121 --> 00:29:07,455
We just have to be patient.

428
00:29:07,539 --> 00:29:09,457
-Just like that story about the tortoise--
-Stop talking.

429
00:29:10,542 --> 00:29:11,668
Well, that was rude.

430
00:29:11,751 --> 00:29:14,921
I just wanted to see if it'll work.
And January was annoying me.

431
00:29:15,005 --> 00:29:17,382
Can you order yourself
to be less obnoxious?

432
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:19,884
Hey, that was a joke. Come on.

433
00:29:19,968 --> 00:29:21,803
You don't have much
to freak out about, anyway.

434
00:29:22,345 --> 00:29:24,097
Your mom's the boss.
You're in no matter what.

435
00:29:24,180 --> 00:29:27,142
You seriously overestimate
my relationship with my mother.

436
00:29:27,225 --> 00:29:30,228
Oh, my God. Guys, you can see me, right?

437
00:29:30,311 --> 00:29:32,689
Everything except your face.

438
00:29:34,190 --> 00:29:35,859
What's wrong with my face?

439
00:29:37,277 --> 00:29:38,486
Where'd January go?

440
00:29:39,237 --> 00:29:40,238
Dunno.

441
00:29:40,697 --> 00:29:41,740
But I can see your face again.

442
00:29:43,533 --> 00:29:44,367
Hmm?

443
00:29:44,951 --> 00:29:46,911
It doesn't make sense.

444
00:29:46,995 --> 00:29:50,290
James said our powers are unique,
and we already have an invisible girl.

445
00:29:50,373 --> 00:29:51,249
Not anymore.

446
00:29:51,332 --> 00:29:52,334
-Ow!

447
00:29:52,667 --> 00:29:53,793
Ugh, really?

448
00:29:53,877 --> 00:29:55,378
-You slapped me.
-You deserved it.

449
00:29:55,462 --> 00:29:56,379
Ooh, I can talk again.

450
00:29:56,463 --> 00:29:58,173
-Slap yourself.
-No, you slap yourself.

451
00:29:58,256 --> 00:30:00,091
-Ow!
-Why did you do that?

452
00:30:00,175 --> 00:30:01,134
She told me to do it.

453
00:30:01,217 --> 00:30:02,969
I'm so confused.

454
00:30:03,845 --> 00:30:07,849
When January touched Roxana,
she became invisible,

455
00:30:07,932 --> 00:30:11,603
and when she touched Tuma,
he did exactly what she told him to.

456
00:30:11,686 --> 00:30:13,646
So, whoever I touch last...

457
00:30:13,730 --> 00:30:16,733
You take away their power,
and it becomes yours.

458
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:19,861
Great. Now I'm the only person
without a power.

459
00:30:20,570 --> 00:30:21,446
Typical.

460
00:30:21,529 --> 00:30:25,367
Hey, you're going to find your power too,
and it's gonna be awesome.

461
00:30:26,701 --> 00:30:28,745
Really think so?

462
00:30:28,828 --> 00:30:29,662
Yeah.

463
00:30:30,872 --> 00:30:31,873
Totally.

464
00:30:32,874 --> 00:30:35,877
I hope it's X-ray vision... or flying.

465
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:38,338
Well, flying is involved.

466
00:30:39,047 --> 00:30:43,259
Hey, dude, your power's being
a bug magnet. You're Bug Man.

467
00:30:47,639 --> 00:30:50,266
There are, like, 100 rooms in here.

468
00:30:50,350 --> 00:30:52,477
Why do we all have to share the same one?

469
00:30:53,019 --> 00:30:54,521
I guess they want us to bond?

470
00:30:54,604 --> 00:30:56,481
Oh, great.
Let me know how that goes, yeah?

471
00:30:58,149 --> 00:30:59,150
Later.

472
00:31:01,820 --> 00:31:05,323
Oh, not too bad.
Hey, we can work with this.

473
00:31:05,407 --> 00:31:06,866
I guess we should choose our beds, right?

474
00:31:06,950 --> 00:31:08,410
-Hey, give me that bed.
-Okay.

475
00:31:08,493 --> 00:31:09,994
I love this power.

476
00:31:12,122 --> 00:31:13,123
Whoo.

477
00:31:16,918 --> 00:31:18,503
Did you have any idea you were different?

478
00:31:19,629 --> 00:31:20,797
Before today, I mean.

479
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:23,675
Yeah.

480
00:31:23,758 --> 00:31:26,594
About a year ago people started doing
the craziest things when I asked.

481
00:31:27,095 --> 00:31:31,016
I always thought it was because I was
super charming but now it all makes sense.

482
00:31:31,558 --> 00:31:32,559
How about you?

483
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:33,852
I don't know.

484
00:31:34,436 --> 00:31:37,480
The last few months,
I've been getting a lot of bug bites.

485
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:40,233
I didn't think much of it,
and no one else noticed, of course.

486
00:31:41,151 --> 00:31:42,610
One of the benefits of being invisible.

487
00:31:42,694 --> 00:31:44,487
Hey,
you're not invisible to invisible girl.

488
00:31:44,571 --> 00:31:46,740
I saw that butterfly she gave you.

489
00:31:47,323 --> 00:31:48,491
She'd never go for a guy like me.

490
00:31:48,575 --> 00:31:49,868
Never say never.

491
00:31:50,869 --> 00:31:53,788
Hey, you can have this bed if you want to.
I shouldn't have just--

492
00:31:53,872 --> 00:31:55,040
It's okay. This one's fine.

493
00:31:58,460 --> 00:32:01,629
But maybe next time
don't do that powers thing on me.

494
00:32:01,713 --> 00:32:04,299
Fair enough.
As long as you keep your bugs to yourself.

495
00:32:04,382 --> 00:32:05,216
Deal.

496
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:08,803
Mind if I take the top?

497
00:32:10,513 --> 00:32:15,352
My twin brother always took the top bunk
when we were kids. He's the worst.

498
00:32:16,227 --> 00:32:18,229
He cheated on all of his finals.

499
00:32:18,730 --> 00:32:21,649
I'm genuinely worried about our country
if he's the one who's ruling it.

500
00:32:21,733 --> 00:32:25,904
He was born first by a minute,
so he gets the throne. So unfair.

501
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:26,988
I hear you.

502
00:32:27,072 --> 00:32:28,573
Is your sister horrible too?

503
00:32:29,783 --> 00:32:33,119
Actually, no. She's perfect in every way.

504
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:34,579
Being a second-born is bad enough,

505
00:32:34,662 --> 00:32:37,540
but when you always feel
like you're second place...

506
00:32:38,166 --> 00:32:39,584
It's not just that.

507
00:32:42,796 --> 00:32:45,840
It's constantly feeling
like I'm being compared to her

508
00:32:46,299 --> 00:32:49,135
or compared to how a princess should be.

509
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:53,098
Like, we can't have our own identities.

510
00:32:54,391 --> 00:32:55,392
Exactly.

511
00:32:59,646 --> 00:33:01,189
Backup phone. Smart.

512
00:33:01,856 --> 00:33:04,025
Don't worry, I can keep a secret.

513
00:33:29,968 --> 00:33:34,472
Learning to use your powers is
all about focus, concentration, precision.

514
00:33:38,560 --> 00:33:41,896
Right now, your powers are being
controlled by hormones,

515
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:46,067
stressful situations, peer pressure,
social anxiety, physical attraction,

516
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:48,319
even loud music from an overrated band.

517
00:33:48,903 --> 00:33:50,905
Now that you know what your powers are,

518
00:33:50,989 --> 00:33:52,699
training is about learning
to control them.

519
00:33:52,782 --> 00:33:53,783
How do we do that?

520
00:33:54,826 --> 00:33:55,827
Practice.

521
00:33:57,412 --> 00:34:00,415
This test is designed
to help sharpen your super senses.

522
00:34:00,498 --> 00:34:02,584
Listen carefully to the voices.

523
00:34:03,418 --> 00:34:04,919
-Okay, pay attention.
-

524
00:34:05,003 --> 00:34:08,631
A little boy just told Santa
what he wants for Christmas. What is it?

525
00:34:08,715 --> 00:34:10,425
Remember the last time we were here?

526
00:34:10,508 --> 00:34:11,843
Of course.
-Not socks?

527
00:34:11,926 --> 00:34:13,720
The results are in.
Are you ready to find out?

528
00:34:13,803 --> 00:34:15,555
I just don't have a good feeling--

529
00:34:17,098 --> 00:34:19,476
The boy is asking for...

530
00:34:19,559 --> 00:34:20,643
It's not a big deal.

531
00:34:20,727 --> 00:34:22,020
I'm not going to cheat.

532
00:34:22,103 --> 00:34:24,230
Because he has the same answers
to the final every year.

533
00:34:24,314 --> 00:34:25,398
I don't know.

534
00:34:25,482 --> 00:34:28,068
"To learn to succeed,
you must first learn to fail."

535
00:34:34,908 --> 00:34:38,036
Prince Tuma, you have one of the more
unique powers I've ever seen.

536
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,497
-Thanks.
-I understand you're quite the dog lover.

537
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,875
Big time! I've got five purebreds
back at the palace and they love me.

538
00:34:43,958 --> 00:34:45,251
Glad you said that.

539
00:34:45,335 --> 00:34:47,796
Because your powers rely
on your interactions with others,

540
00:34:47,879 --> 00:34:48,880
you'll need a partner.

541
00:34:48,963 --> 00:34:49,964
Bring it.

542
00:34:50,048 --> 00:34:53,218
And seeing as no royal has ever been able
to train Charlie,

543
00:34:53,301 --> 00:34:56,346
we thought your unique skill set
could meet the challenge.

544
00:34:56,429 --> 00:34:57,430
Charlie?

545
00:34:57,514 --> 00:34:59,683
Prince Tuma, meet Charlie.

546
00:35:00,892 --> 00:35:04,521
If you can get him to obey your orders,
you can get anyone to follow your command.

547
00:35:07,190 --> 00:35:10,318
What, what do I have to practice?
Isn't my power borrowing someone else's?

548
00:35:10,402 --> 00:35:13,113
Yes, but you need to learn how
to do it for more than a few seconds.

549
00:35:13,196 --> 00:35:15,949
We're gonna work on getting you
to keep them for as long as necessary.

550
00:35:16,408 --> 00:35:17,409
In a pool?

551
00:35:18,493 --> 00:35:20,078
I wanna introduce you to someone.

552
00:35:20,161 --> 00:35:22,372
She is gonna help you with your training.

553
00:35:23,123 --> 00:35:24,499
Pleasure to meet you.

554
00:35:24,582 --> 00:35:27,877
I'm Princess Anna of Spain.
My power is breathing underwater.

555
00:35:28,461 --> 00:35:29,462
And now it's yours.

556
00:35:30,213 --> 00:35:31,756
-Good luck.
-

557
00:35:38,555 --> 00:35:39,556
Ready?

558
00:35:42,267 --> 00:35:45,520
-Come on. Lift it.

559
00:35:45,603 --> 00:35:47,605
Insects aren't just drawn to you, Matteo.

560
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:49,107
You can also control them.

561
00:35:52,694 --> 00:35:55,113
-

562
00:35:58,867 --> 00:36:00,493
-

563
00:36:00,577 --> 00:36:02,120
I love that you get me, James.

564
00:36:02,203 --> 00:36:04,706
Honestly, I've been so missing
my Karma cycle class,

565
00:36:04,789 --> 00:36:07,125
but, you know, I wasn't about to complain.

566
00:36:07,876 --> 00:36:08,793
Oh, what's that?

567
00:36:08,877 --> 00:36:10,253
Solar flare simulation.

568
00:36:10,337 --> 00:36:12,339
Agents must be prepared
to deploy year-round,

569
00:36:12,422 --> 00:36:14,549
bearing the coldest of winters
to the hottest of summers.

570
00:36:14,632 --> 00:36:17,344
That artificial sun is scrumpt--

571
00:36:17,969 --> 00:36:21,139
Do you reckon I can still tan
whilst I'm invisible?

572
00:36:23,975 --> 00:36:24,976
Oi.

573
00:36:29,356 --> 00:36:30,690
Ah, goggles. Wise choice.

574
00:36:33,026 --> 00:36:34,861
Oh. Oh.

575
00:36:34,944 --> 00:36:38,823
All right, James. I get it.
We're ready year-round.

576
00:36:38,907 --> 00:36:41,910
All seasons. Please push stop.

577
00:36:41,993 --> 00:36:44,371
You disappear, I turn it off.

578
00:36:44,454 --> 00:36:46,956
Gosh, that's so annoying.
Why can't I disappear?

579
00:36:51,252 --> 00:36:52,671
Remember the last time we were here?

580
00:36:55,465 --> 00:36:57,384
I'm so over this.

581
00:36:57,467 --> 00:36:59,302
Hey! You've got the power of persuasion.

582
00:36:59,386 --> 00:37:02,055
Surely you can compel James
to return my phone.

583
00:37:02,138 --> 00:37:05,350
Your fans won't care
if you don't post for 48 hours.

584
00:37:05,433 --> 00:37:08,103
I've an image to maintain.
A responsibility.

585
00:37:08,186 --> 00:37:09,604
What about serving your kingdom?

586
00:37:09,688 --> 00:37:11,773
Firsties are the ones
with all the responsibility.

587
00:37:11,856 --> 00:37:14,025
Whole point of being us is hakuna matata.

588
00:37:15,151 --> 00:37:17,028
Hey, you're not the one
who has to spend their summer

589
00:37:17,112 --> 00:37:18,822
running away from man's best friend.

590
00:37:18,905 --> 00:37:20,657
Okay, kids, lunch is up.

591
00:37:22,450 --> 00:37:23,451
Sam.

592
00:37:29,207 --> 00:37:30,625
This smells toxic.

593
00:37:31,543 --> 00:37:35,213
Relax. Only Sam's was poisoned.
She needs the practice.

594
00:37:36,506 --> 00:37:38,842
Everything is a test. Everything.

595
00:37:38,925 --> 00:37:40,510
Dang. That's cold.

596
00:37:43,179 --> 00:37:45,598
Here. We can share.

597
00:37:46,224 --> 00:37:47,809
Red apples are my favorite.

598
00:37:48,852 --> 00:37:49,936
Thanks.

599
00:37:55,775 --> 00:37:56,901
I just realized something.

600
00:37:59,112 --> 00:38:02,657
I've never had lunch with other kids
at Strathmore before.

601
00:38:07,704 --> 00:38:10,290
All right, I'm out. Time to train.

602
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:13,918
-Hey, come on, Charlie.
-

603
00:38:14,002 --> 00:38:15,628
Oh!
- Come on, boy.

604
00:38:22,177 --> 00:38:24,220
I'm gonna get malaria and die.

605
00:38:24,304 --> 00:38:25,805
-No, you're not.
-You might.

606
00:38:25,889 --> 00:38:26,890
Yeah, actually, you might.

607
00:38:33,146 --> 00:38:36,107
-Hey.
-Hey. Sorry I've been MIA.

608
00:38:36,191 --> 00:38:37,692
How's it going? What class are you taking?

609
00:38:38,109 --> 00:38:39,611
You know, the ushe.

610
00:38:40,945 --> 00:38:42,113
How's your summer going?

611
00:38:42,781 --> 00:38:44,366
Well, not as much fun without you,

612
00:38:44,449 --> 00:38:46,951
but it's gonna be awesome.
I printed out the fliers for our gig.

613
00:38:48,411 --> 00:38:49,621
-

614
00:38:53,208 --> 00:38:54,250
Can't wait.

615
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:56,294
I gotta go.

616
00:38:56,378 --> 00:38:58,213
Yeah, okay. Uh...

617
00:38:59,047 --> 00:38:59,964
Good night.

618
00:39:02,425 --> 00:39:03,426
Good night.

619
00:39:07,764 --> 00:39:09,015
Hey, those look great.

620
00:39:09,099 --> 00:39:10,058
Thanks.

621
00:39:13,103 --> 00:39:16,523
You know, I've been working
for royals my entire life.

622
00:39:16,606 --> 00:39:18,274
They live in their own world.

623
00:39:18,775 --> 00:39:22,028
I'm just worried that someday
she's gonna forget about you and move on.

624
00:39:22,112 --> 00:39:23,405
I don't want to see you get hurt.

625
00:39:24,364 --> 00:39:25,365
Sam's not like that, Dad.

626
00:39:26,658 --> 00:39:27,951
She's my best friend.

627
00:39:49,931 --> 00:39:52,058
Hey, James. You wanted to see me?

628
00:39:52,142 --> 00:39:53,309
Mom?

629
00:39:56,813 --> 00:39:58,565
Teleportation?

630
00:39:58,648 --> 00:40:00,233
-That's your power?
-Mm-hmm.

631
00:40:00,817 --> 00:40:02,277
Next time call me a Lyft.

632
00:40:02,360 --> 00:40:03,778
James said you're struggling.

633
00:40:12,787 --> 00:40:14,664
Epsilon 97 red Q zero.

634
00:40:18,251 --> 00:40:20,670
I'm guessing
that's not your Wi-Fi password.

635
00:40:21,254 --> 00:40:24,466
Royal master code.
Opens every door in the palace.

636
00:40:24,549 --> 00:40:26,343
Overrides any security measure.

637
00:40:26,843 --> 00:40:29,971
As the queen and the head of the Society,
I'm the only person who has it.

638
00:40:30,638 --> 00:40:32,474
I'm sharing it because I trust you.

639
00:40:33,767 --> 00:40:35,393
Might wanna hold on to that chair.

640
00:41:00,627 --> 00:41:02,879
We have a Batcave under our house?

641
00:41:03,296 --> 00:41:04,297
Our headquarters.

642
00:41:04,798 --> 00:41:07,425
No recruit is supposed to see it
until training is complete.

643
00:41:07,509 --> 00:41:09,719
Wow. So you're breaking the rules.

644
00:41:09,803 --> 00:41:11,012
I won't tell if you won't.

645
00:41:12,138 --> 00:41:13,306
What is all this stuff?

646
00:41:14,265 --> 00:41:15,767
Disrupter prototype.

647
00:41:15,850 --> 00:41:18,770
Stolen from a research facility in Kyoto.
Recovered by us.

648
00:41:20,313 --> 00:41:23,733
Ultrasonic elephant whistle
taken from a poaching ring in Chad.

649
00:41:24,984 --> 00:41:28,905
DNA-based nano-device programmed
to target specific genetic sequences.

650
00:41:28,988 --> 00:41:31,908
It can isolate
and contain cellular materials.

651
00:41:33,618 --> 00:41:35,620
Our most decorated operatives.

652
00:41:38,540 --> 00:41:40,542
Lots of people struggle in the beginning.

653
00:41:43,003 --> 00:41:44,254
What's with the empty frame?

654
00:41:45,130 --> 00:41:47,048
A former member who betrayed us.

655
00:41:47,966 --> 00:41:50,468
We keep it empty as a reminder
our powers were given to us

656
00:41:50,552 --> 00:41:52,971
to defend the world, not rule it.

657
00:41:54,723 --> 00:41:56,224
You don't have to worry about that.

658
00:41:57,559 --> 00:42:00,478
I can't even figure out
what some kid wants for Christmas.

659
00:42:01,271 --> 00:42:04,566
The key to mastering your power
is mastering yourself.

660
00:42:05,025 --> 00:42:06,943
It's not helpful.

661
00:42:07,610 --> 00:42:10,947
I know how hard training is,
but this is worth it.

662
00:42:11,031 --> 00:42:13,950
I don't know what this is.

663
00:42:14,993 --> 00:42:18,371
I mean, a couple weeks ago I thought
you were banishing me to summer school,

664
00:42:18,455 --> 00:42:21,041
and then I find out
that you're head of the Avengers.

665
00:42:21,124 --> 00:42:23,835
I have these powers
that I don't know how to use,

666
00:42:23,918 --> 00:42:26,171
and I'm supposed to defend the world?

667
00:42:26,254 --> 00:42:28,214
I went through the same feelings
when I was your age.

668
00:42:28,298 --> 00:42:29,924
I'm a second-born too.

669
00:42:30,925 --> 00:42:32,135
What did you do?

670
00:42:32,218 --> 00:42:34,929
I let go of the pressure
I was putting on myself

671
00:42:35,764 --> 00:42:38,224
and allowed myself
to just be in the moment.

672
00:42:38,767 --> 00:42:40,268
All I hear is noise.

673
00:42:40,810 --> 00:42:41,811
Try this.

674
00:42:42,520 --> 00:42:45,357
You are at one
of those royal events you love,

675
00:42:46,107 --> 00:42:47,984
people, music, chitchat.

676
00:42:48,068 --> 00:42:49,277
What do you do?

677
00:42:49,361 --> 00:42:50,612
I tune them out.

678
00:42:51,071 --> 00:42:52,405
Mm-hmm.

679
00:42:52,489 --> 00:42:55,325
Now, find the sound you want to hear.

680
00:42:56,785 --> 00:42:58,453
You're stronger than you know, Sam.

681
00:42:58,536 --> 00:43:00,246
There's many things
that are different than a toy...

682
00:43:00,330 --> 00:43:01,706
We have the results.
Are you ready to find out?

683
00:43:01,790 --> 00:43:03,833
-...same answers to the final every year.
- I don't think it's a good idea.

684
00:43:03,917 --> 00:43:05,794
-...Santa could bring you for Christmas.
- Fine. Your loss.

685
00:43:05,877 --> 00:43:08,463
I just want my mom to get better.

686
00:43:11,216 --> 00:43:12,634
The boy's mom is sick.

687
00:43:13,968 --> 00:43:16,221
He's asking Santa
if she's going to get better.

688
00:43:16,721 --> 00:43:19,140
-Mm-hmm. Keep going.
- Will you marry me?

689
00:43:19,224 --> 00:43:23,395
A guy is proposing to his girlfriend
in the spot where they first met.

690
00:43:24,771 --> 00:43:25,772
It's not a big deal.

691
00:43:25,855 --> 00:43:29,693
A girl has the answers to a bio test,
but her friend doesn't want to cheat.

692
00:43:29,776 --> 00:43:31,695
Mm-hmm.
- It's a boy. And a girl.

693
00:43:31,778 --> 00:43:35,740
A doctor is telling a pregnant woman
that she's having...

694
00:43:35,824 --> 00:43:37,409
Congratulations,
you're having twins.

695
00:43:37,492 --> 00:43:38,576
...twins.

696
00:43:38,993 --> 00:43:39,994
Excellent work.

697
00:43:42,747 --> 00:43:46,001
See? Being second-born
doesn't mean you're second-best.

698
00:43:47,502 --> 00:43:49,671
Just one question.
-Mm-hmm?

699
00:43:49,754 --> 00:43:51,548
Does the boy's mom get better?

700
00:43:52,424 --> 00:43:55,427
Yeah, she did.
And yours would be very proud.

701
00:43:57,262 --> 00:43:58,430
Are we gonna go again?

702
00:43:59,472 --> 00:44:01,474
Okay, whatever you say.

703
00:44:04,310 --> 00:44:07,188
Please tell me you can't see anything!

704
00:44:07,272 --> 00:44:09,649
All I see is a princess
who needs to work harder.

705
00:44:09,733 --> 00:44:16,114
James, I want nothing more
than to get off this... stupid thing!

706
00:44:16,197 --> 00:44:18,366
But I just can't do it.

707
00:44:19,659 --> 00:44:20,827
Come on. Lift it.

708
00:44:25,957 --> 00:44:26,791
Yes.

709
00:44:31,338 --> 00:44:33,173
-How'd I do this time?

710
00:44:33,256 --> 00:44:35,550
You were under for ten minutes.

711
00:44:35,633 --> 00:44:38,178
That's the longest
you've held on to my powers yet.

712
00:44:38,261 --> 00:44:39,387
Yes.

713
00:44:39,471 --> 00:44:41,306
Brava. Quite the improvement.

714
00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:43,558
Hey, Charlie!

715
00:44:47,145 --> 00:44:49,147
No class for you today, Prince Tuma.

716
00:44:49,230 --> 00:44:51,316
Really? Sweet.

717
00:44:51,399 --> 00:44:52,776
-Yeah. Charlie's sick.
-Oh.

718
00:44:53,234 --> 00:44:54,861
He ate something
that didn't agree with him.

719
00:45:02,035 --> 00:45:03,036
Hey, buddy.

720
00:45:05,288 --> 00:45:06,289
Charlie.

721
00:45:07,749 --> 00:45:10,001
I didn't know that treat
would make you sick.

722
00:45:10,627 --> 00:45:13,046
I was just trying to be nice.
I didn't know what else to do.

723
00:45:14,631 --> 00:45:16,841
Everyone always just listens
to what I tell them.

724
00:45:21,388 --> 00:45:22,305
Okay.

725
00:45:23,306 --> 00:45:25,350
Look, look, look.

726
00:45:25,433 --> 00:45:26,726
-This is my fault.
-

727
00:45:26,810 --> 00:45:30,021
Clearly, physical duress
doesn't trigger your powers.

728
00:45:30,105 --> 00:45:32,357
I got something really special
for you, Roxy. Okay?

729
00:45:32,440 --> 00:45:34,067
-Oh, my phone.
-Yeah.

730
00:45:36,277 --> 00:45:37,195
What are you doing?

731
00:45:37,278 --> 00:45:39,781
I know you missed your followers
over the past few weeks.

732
00:45:39,864 --> 00:45:42,200
I'm sure that they would love
to say hi, right?

733
00:45:42,283 --> 00:45:45,203
You're bluffing.
I mean, you don't even know my password.

734
00:45:45,286 --> 00:45:47,706
With the click of a button,
I can create the most sophisticated

735
00:45:47,789 --> 00:45:50,709
interactive obstacle course in the world.
I think I got this.

736
00:45:50,792 --> 00:45:53,628
No. They can't see me like this.
James, why are you being so mean?

737
00:45:53,712 --> 00:45:57,465
-And we are live in four, three, two, one!
-I mean. I mean, look at me. No. No. No!

738
00:45:57,549 --> 00:45:58,550
No!

739
00:45:59,467 --> 00:46:02,846
-Well done. Same time tomorrow.

740
00:46:03,930 --> 00:46:04,973
Can you please log off?

741
00:46:06,141 --> 00:46:09,978
Oh, I was never online.
Reception's terrible down here.

742
00:46:23,491 --> 00:46:24,659
Everything okay?

743
00:46:25,160 --> 00:46:27,120
I turned myself invisible today.

744
00:46:27,203 --> 00:46:28,246
That's great.

745
00:46:28,830 --> 00:46:29,998
But it's not.

746
00:46:31,416 --> 00:46:34,377
I'm able to do all these really cool
things, but no one will see me.

747
00:46:34,461 --> 00:46:35,795
So, what does it matter?

748
00:46:35,879 --> 00:46:39,090
I forgot, livestream or it's not real.

749
00:46:39,174 --> 00:46:40,800
Performance is part of being a royal.

750
00:46:40,884 --> 00:46:42,677
I've lived my whole life online.

751
00:46:45,430 --> 00:46:46,681
It's always been me.

752
00:46:47,223 --> 00:46:50,727
Why can't you be you without all that?

753
00:46:51,561 --> 00:46:53,646
Because I genuinely don't know
where to start.

754
00:46:55,565 --> 00:46:57,275
Well, I can't help you with that.

755
00:47:00,070 --> 00:47:02,572
Only because you have to figure that out
for yourself.

756
00:47:06,284 --> 00:47:07,702
-Yeah.
-

757
00:47:08,370 --> 00:47:09,287
How do I look?

758
00:47:09,954 --> 00:47:10,789
Awful.

759
00:47:24,302 --> 00:47:25,303
It's a new record.

760
00:47:42,570 --> 00:47:44,364
Come on.
-

761
00:47:45,031 --> 00:47:46,116
Yes!
- Awesome!

762
00:47:46,199 --> 00:47:48,118
-Bro!
-

763
00:47:48,201 --> 00:47:49,119
That was awesome.

764
00:47:49,202 --> 00:47:51,121
-Thank you.
-Charlie! You're all better!

765
00:47:51,663 --> 00:47:52,622
Aw.

766
00:48:06,845 --> 00:48:12,851
Hey, Sam. I'm here. Got the gear.
Super pumped.

767
00:48:18,189 --> 00:48:19,190
Hey, come see our show.

768
00:48:47,052 --> 00:48:49,971
- Attention, trainees.

769
00:48:50,055 --> 00:48:52,140
Suit up and meet
in the loading dock immediately.

770
00:48:52,807 --> 00:48:56,978
Attention, trainees. Suit up and meet
in the loading dock immediately!

771
00:49:02,108 --> 00:49:04,194
Let's go! Get in. Get in. Get in. Get in.

772
00:49:05,528 --> 00:49:06,738
Let's go!

773
00:49:12,285 --> 00:49:13,995
There's been a break-in
at the royal treasury.

774
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:16,915
If the thieves steal the crown jewels,
they could be sold on the black market

775
00:49:16,998 --> 00:49:18,917
for billions to buy
weapons of mass destruction.

776
00:49:19,000 --> 00:49:21,252
-So super low stakes.
-Our first mission.

777
00:49:21,336 --> 00:49:22,420
We got this.

778
00:49:26,424 --> 00:49:29,052
Hey, come to our show.
We're on soon. Thanks.

779
00:49:30,136 --> 00:49:33,014
Come on, Sam. Where are you?

780
00:49:35,141 --> 00:49:36,601
Hey, come to our show. We're on soon.

781
00:49:38,186 --> 00:49:41,022
Your mission is
to protect the jewels at all costs.

782
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:52,033
Wow! Look at that!

783
00:49:52,617 --> 00:49:54,744
-Those are some big rocks.
-Yeppers.

784
00:49:59,416 --> 00:50:02,210
You guys stay here and guard
the jewels. I saw one of the thieves.

785
00:50:02,293 --> 00:50:03,253
I'm going after him.

786
00:50:03,336 --> 00:50:04,796
She's gonna need backup.

787
00:50:04,879 --> 00:50:06,214
They aren't getting all the glory.

788
00:50:09,801 --> 00:50:11,469
I guess it's just you and me.

789
00:50:12,846 --> 00:50:13,930
Or it's just you.

790
00:50:15,765 --> 00:50:16,683
Hey, guys.

791
00:50:19,227 --> 00:50:20,311
Wait up.

792
00:50:20,395 --> 00:50:22,230
I saw him. He was wearing a hood.

793
00:50:23,148 --> 00:50:25,150
He's got to be in there.
Now what?

794
00:50:25,775 --> 00:50:27,736
Maybe we should just wait for James.

795
00:50:27,819 --> 00:50:31,156
No way. If we take this guy down,
James is gonna be super impressed.

796
00:50:34,826 --> 00:50:36,578
It's so dark.
I can't see anything.

797
00:50:44,502 --> 00:50:45,962
Hey, look.
- Come on.

798
00:50:46,046 --> 00:50:48,631
Come on. Come on.

799
00:50:50,467 --> 00:50:51,593
Watch out!

800
00:50:56,181 --> 00:50:57,182
You did it.

801
00:50:57,891 --> 00:50:59,267
Yeah, I did. Thanks.

802
00:50:59,351 --> 00:51:00,935
That was really smart.

803
00:51:03,563 --> 00:51:06,024
Uh, guys. That's my swim coach.

804
00:51:06,107 --> 00:51:08,568
Wait, why would your swim coach
wanna steal the jewels?

805
00:51:08,651 --> 00:51:09,569
The jewels!

806
00:51:14,157 --> 00:51:17,243
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

807
00:51:18,286 --> 00:51:20,372
-This is bad.
-Oh, you think?

808
00:51:21,039 --> 00:51:23,625
In a matter of minutes,
you managed to disobey my orders,

809
00:51:23,708 --> 00:51:25,293
lose a priceless national treasure,

810
00:51:25,377 --> 00:51:28,546
and put yourself in a potentially
deadly situation with no plan.

811
00:51:29,631 --> 00:51:32,258
Your degree of failure is remarkable.

812
00:51:33,218 --> 00:51:34,719
Thank you for your help, Princess Anna.

813
00:51:34,803 --> 00:51:37,555
Of course. Anytime.

814
00:51:37,639 --> 00:51:39,099
Wait, I'm confused. Where are the jewels?

815
00:51:39,182 --> 00:51:41,976
Oh, where they've always been,
in the real treasury.

816
00:51:50,568 --> 00:51:52,821
Congratulations,
you've all failed the test.

817
00:51:53,488 --> 00:51:55,240
I'm canceling tomorrow's training.

818
00:51:55,323 --> 00:51:58,660
Take the day to consider the consequences
had this been real.

819
00:52:01,246 --> 00:52:02,247
Class dismissed.

820
00:52:07,877 --> 00:52:09,129
Where were you?

821
00:52:09,212 --> 00:52:12,340
I'm sorry. I couldn't make it.

822
00:52:12,424 --> 00:52:14,009
Yeah, I know. I was there. What happened?

823
00:52:14,092 --> 00:52:15,385
I just couldn't.

824
00:52:15,844 --> 00:52:18,263
-Sam, what's going on? Talk to me.
-I really wanna tell you...

825
00:52:19,723 --> 00:52:21,391
But I can't.

826
00:52:21,474 --> 00:52:22,726
I gotta go.

827
00:52:27,188 --> 00:52:28,189
You okay?

828
00:52:30,275 --> 00:52:31,359
I don't wanna talk about it.

829
00:52:34,112 --> 00:52:35,530
None of us are getting in.

830
00:52:35,613 --> 00:52:39,617
Catherine said, "No matter what obstacles
you face, nothing is impossible."

831
00:52:40,493 --> 00:52:42,787
She also said
not everyone's gonna make the cut.

832
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:46,124
Definitely one of those people.

833
00:52:47,334 --> 00:52:50,503
Hey, you deserve to be here
as much as anyone else.

834
00:52:51,046 --> 00:52:53,298
I've been going to Strathmore
for three years.

835
00:52:53,381 --> 00:52:55,717
You didn't even know I existed
until this summer.

836
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:58,845
But that wasn't your fault. That was mine.

837
00:53:01,431 --> 00:53:02,682
And we know you now.

838
00:53:03,725 --> 00:53:05,393
Until we all get our minds wiped.

839
00:53:06,811 --> 00:53:08,438
What if that really happens?

840
00:53:09,397 --> 00:53:11,399
We'll forget we even have powers.

841
00:53:12,233 --> 00:53:13,526
We'll forget the whole summer.

842
00:53:15,695 --> 00:53:16,863
Do we really want that?

843
00:53:18,281 --> 00:53:19,199
No way.

844
00:53:19,282 --> 00:53:22,243
Hanging with you guys has been
the best thing that's ever happened to me.

845
00:53:22,327 --> 00:53:25,038
Well, if they're gonna make us forget,

846
00:53:25,121 --> 00:53:27,499
we can at least
make this a day to remember.

847
00:53:29,042 --> 00:53:31,378
I have an idea. Come on.

848
00:54:34,649 --> 00:54:35,984
Told you I'd bring the party.

849
00:54:37,402 --> 00:54:39,779
Is this one as fun as the one you threw
at your old school?

850
00:54:39,863 --> 00:54:42,782
Well, there are no explosions yet, so...

851
00:54:42,866 --> 00:54:44,117
How'd that happen anyway?

852
00:54:45,285 --> 00:54:47,245
My friends and I were messing around
in the lab.

853
00:54:48,121 --> 00:54:50,248
Told them to mix a bunch of chemicals,
as a joke.

854
00:54:50,915 --> 00:54:52,500
You know, see if we could start a fire.

855
00:54:53,460 --> 00:54:55,170
Didn't know I was using my power on them.

856
00:54:56,504 --> 00:54:58,381
Can't really use that excuse anymore.

857
00:55:00,091 --> 00:55:03,345
If I told someone to do something and
something bad happened, it was on them.

858
00:55:04,679 --> 00:55:06,264
But now I realize it's on me.

859
00:55:07,849 --> 00:55:11,102
Took you a while, but you got there.

860
00:55:11,603 --> 00:55:12,896
Now I'm starting to grow on you.

861
00:55:13,396 --> 00:55:16,191
Maybe a little. Like a fungus.

862
00:55:16,900 --> 00:55:19,277
Yeah, like a fungus.

863
00:55:21,571 --> 00:55:22,572
Thanks.

864
00:55:25,992 --> 00:55:28,495
I want a pink one. Are they poisoned?

865
00:55:28,578 --> 00:55:31,164
They're all the same.
If you go down, we all do.

866
00:55:33,375 --> 00:55:34,501
We should do this again.

867
00:55:35,126 --> 00:55:36,711
Maybe, like, Saturday?

868
00:55:37,379 --> 00:55:41,508
Can't. Sister's stupid coronation.
You guys have fun.

869
00:55:41,591 --> 00:55:44,010
Yeah, must suck going to the hottest event
of the season.

870
00:55:44,094 --> 00:55:45,804
With the prettiest dresses.

871
00:55:45,887 --> 00:55:48,973
It's definitely not the hottest event
of the season.

872
00:55:49,474 --> 00:55:53,061
Just instead of only Illyria
obsessing over my sister for an hour,

873
00:55:53,144 --> 00:55:54,396
the whole world gets to.

874
00:55:55,522 --> 00:55:56,940
I can always make Sam invite us.

875
00:55:59,317 --> 00:56:01,778
But mind control would be
a messed up thing to do to a friend.

876
00:56:03,822 --> 00:56:06,282
I mean, if you guys really wanna go,
I could use the company.

877
00:56:06,366 --> 00:56:07,450
-Really?
-Yeah.

878
00:56:10,245 --> 00:56:11,996
Okay. Never do that again.

879
00:56:12,080 --> 00:56:13,331
Oh, my God!

880
00:56:19,129 --> 00:56:21,172
You guys go ahead. We'll catch up.

881
00:56:21,840 --> 00:56:23,091
That was the best day ever.

882
00:56:23,466 --> 00:56:25,927
Totally, so why are you sad?

883
00:56:26,594 --> 00:56:30,348
It just hit me. I'm leaving soon,
which means I'm not going to be here.

884
00:56:30,432 --> 00:56:33,101
After training, it's back to my kingdom
and my stupid brother.

885
00:56:34,519 --> 00:56:37,105
We never even got a chance
to hang out at your palace.

886
00:56:39,274 --> 00:56:40,275
How about now?

887
00:56:42,777 --> 00:56:43,778
Come on.

888
00:56:49,826 --> 00:56:51,786
Can't believe you talked me
into missing curfew.

889
00:56:51,870 --> 00:56:53,538
We could get into so much trouble.

890
00:56:54,080 --> 00:56:55,081
I like it.

891
00:56:55,749 --> 00:56:57,792
They tightened security
for the upcoming coronation.

892
00:56:57,876 --> 00:57:00,420
We can't go through the front gate
without my mom finding out.

893
00:57:00,503 --> 00:57:01,504
Come on.

894
00:57:08,303 --> 00:57:10,138
Epsilon 97 red Q zero.

895
00:57:28,281 --> 00:57:29,199
Wow!

896
00:57:30,158 --> 00:57:32,577
My dad converted the tower into a studio.

897
00:57:33,787 --> 00:57:36,831
He and my uncle Edmond would come up here
and jam all the time.

898
00:57:38,333 --> 00:57:44,547
He always said, "Snowflake, it's good
to rule, but it's more fun to rock."

899
00:58:01,981 --> 00:58:03,775
It was either piano or ballet.

900
00:58:04,275 --> 00:58:07,570
Had a lot of free time while everyone
doted on my precious brother.

901
00:58:30,093 --> 00:58:32,262
-Sam?

902
00:58:36,641 --> 00:58:37,684
Mike, wait!

903
00:58:37,767 --> 00:58:40,895
No. Mike, wait! Wait!

904
00:58:41,396 --> 00:58:42,605
I'm sorry about the gig.

905
00:58:42,689 --> 00:58:44,190
Yeah, and now you're in a band
with somebody else?

906
00:58:44,274 --> 00:58:45,817
No, she's just a girl from school.

907
00:58:45,900 --> 00:58:49,112
-Oh, right. You mean another princess.
-It's not like that. I can explain.

908
00:58:49,195 --> 00:58:50,196
Go ahead.

909
00:58:51,406 --> 00:58:52,323
I--

910
00:58:52,657 --> 00:58:55,493
Yeah, that's what I thought.

911
00:58:56,411 --> 00:58:58,038
Later, Your Highness.

912
00:59:05,545 --> 00:59:06,463
Everything okay?

913
00:59:08,256 --> 00:59:09,257
We should get back.

914
00:59:21,144 --> 00:59:23,271
My mom really wanted me
to do the whole ballet thing,

915
00:59:23,355 --> 00:59:24,522
but I'm happy I picked piano.

916
00:59:24,606 --> 00:59:28,777
It's so much fun to just jam,
and, anyway, tulle makes me itch.

917
00:59:28,860 --> 00:59:29,944
Mm-hmm.

918
00:59:31,196 --> 00:59:32,655
-

919
00:59:35,533 --> 00:59:37,786
Really, James? Kidnapping after curfew?

920
00:59:37,869 --> 00:59:40,538
I mean, I get it.
Lesson three, everything's a test.

921
00:59:42,290 --> 00:59:44,417
- It's not a simulation!

922
00:59:48,129 --> 00:59:49,047
-Freeze!
-

923
00:59:58,765 --> 00:59:59,724
Sam?

924
00:59:59,808 --> 01:00:00,809
Another time...

925
01:00:01,643 --> 01:00:02,644
Snowflake.

926
01:00:05,188 --> 01:00:06,189
What happened?

927
01:00:06,272 --> 01:00:08,441
There was this really scary guy,
and he had powers too,

928
01:00:08,525 --> 01:00:10,735
and he threw January and Sam
without even touching them.

929
01:00:10,819 --> 01:00:12,570
Go to your rooms.
Lock the doors right now.

930
01:00:12,654 --> 01:00:14,989
-Who was he?
-He's a very dangerous telekinetic.

931
01:00:15,073 --> 01:00:16,991
-Yeah, no kidding.
-We have to go after him.

932
01:00:17,075 --> 01:00:18,159
That's out of the question.

933
01:00:18,827 --> 01:00:21,913
He called me "Snowflake."
Only my father did that.

934
01:00:21,996 --> 01:00:23,832
-Stand down, Sam.
-How did he know?

935
01:00:23,915 --> 01:00:24,916
That's an order.

936
01:00:27,168 --> 01:00:29,170
Okay. Go to your rooms and stay there.

937
01:00:41,224 --> 01:00:43,476
Sam! Hey! Wait!

938
01:01:28,980 --> 01:01:30,190
Who are you?

939
01:01:38,740 --> 01:01:39,824
Stop!

940
01:01:42,327 --> 01:01:44,788
-Hello, James.
-Surrender.

941
01:01:44,871 --> 01:01:46,206
You know I won't.

942
01:02:12,982 --> 01:02:15,276
You can't win. There's too many of us.

943
01:02:15,360 --> 01:02:17,028
All I need is one.

944
01:02:20,782 --> 01:02:21,866
-

945
01:02:27,539 --> 01:02:28,832
James!
- January!

946
01:02:28,915 --> 01:02:29,916
Sam!

947
01:02:31,334 --> 01:02:32,335
Sam!

948
01:02:32,877 --> 01:02:33,920
Sam!

949
01:02:35,046 --> 01:02:36,172
You knock out the original,

950
01:02:36,256 --> 01:02:37,632
-you knock out the power.
- James!

951
01:02:37,716 --> 01:02:38,967
Tell me who you are.

952
01:02:42,971 --> 01:02:46,224
For the last ten years,
it has been "Inmate 34."

953
01:02:46,599 --> 01:02:48,351
January!
- Sam!

954
01:02:48,435 --> 01:02:51,479
But before your mother
took my name away from me...

955
01:02:51,563 --> 01:02:52,856
James!

956
01:02:52,939 --> 01:02:54,315
...I was your favorite uncle.

957
01:02:56,443 --> 01:02:57,444
January!

958
01:03:08,997 --> 01:03:10,248
My turn.

959
01:03:17,172 --> 01:03:18,173
Hey.

960
01:03:19,466 --> 01:03:21,843
I've got your back, always.

961
01:03:25,722 --> 01:03:27,140
Let's go find the others.

962
01:03:29,768 --> 01:03:31,603
All right. Here we go.

963
01:03:31,686 --> 01:03:33,438
Two bumps, and up.

964
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:38,360
Radio the university
and let them know we're ten out.

965
01:03:38,443 --> 01:03:41,363
Will do.
All right, just hooking him up here.

966
01:03:42,739 --> 01:03:45,241
Vitals are stable.
We'll start O2 if we need to.

967
01:03:45,325 --> 01:03:46,951
Gotcha. I'm right behind you.

968
01:03:54,042 --> 01:03:55,585
Let 'em know we're on our way.

969
01:03:59,673 --> 01:04:00,674
This is all my fault.

970
01:04:01,174 --> 01:04:02,300
Hey, no.

971
01:04:02,384 --> 01:04:04,094
You did what you could to stop him.

972
01:04:36,209 --> 01:04:38,044
James is in intensive care.

973
01:04:38,128 --> 01:04:41,131
You put his life and yours in danger
because you disobeyed an order.

974
01:04:41,214 --> 01:04:42,590
Is he really my uncle?

975
01:04:48,513 --> 01:04:50,515
-Sam, it's complicated.
-I'll make it simple.

976
01:04:51,558 --> 01:04:53,309
There was no plane crash.

977
01:04:53,393 --> 01:04:58,273
The empty frame on the wall, the man
who betrayed the Society, that was Edmond.

978
01:04:59,107 --> 01:05:00,859
Is my father still alive too?

979
01:05:02,777 --> 01:05:03,778
No, darling.

980
01:05:04,446 --> 01:05:05,530
He's not.

981
01:05:06,865 --> 01:05:10,285
Edmond wanted to be king,
so he murdered your father.

982
01:05:10,368 --> 01:05:12,579
I uncovered the truth
before he claimed the throne,

983
01:05:12,662 --> 01:05:13,955
but nobody could know.

984
01:05:14,706 --> 01:05:16,791
Trust in the royal family
would've been shattered.

985
01:05:16,875 --> 01:05:18,043
So you lied.

986
01:05:18,668 --> 01:05:20,295
I did the only thing I could.

987
01:05:20,378 --> 01:05:22,047
He killed my dad.

988
01:05:22,130 --> 01:05:24,090
And my husband.

989
01:05:24,174 --> 01:05:28,219
I stripped Edmond of his identity.
I locked him up in our most secure prison.

990
01:05:28,303 --> 01:05:31,473
It's no coincidence
he escaped so close to the coronation.

991
01:05:32,766 --> 01:05:36,102
He wants the throne, and he wants revenge.

992
01:05:36,186 --> 01:05:37,520
I wanna see him.

993
01:05:38,813 --> 01:05:39,939
Mom, please.

994
01:06:01,503 --> 01:06:03,588
Hey.
-Snowflake.

995
01:06:03,672 --> 01:06:05,131
You wanna learn how to play?

996
01:06:05,215 --> 01:06:06,591
Come on over here.

997
01:06:07,467 --> 01:06:11,179
So all you have to do is you just
strum the guitar like that. Can you do it?

998
01:06:14,015 --> 01:06:15,767
You're officially a rock star, yeah.

999
01:06:21,940 --> 01:06:22,982
Catherine?

1000
01:06:23,942 --> 01:06:25,443
Have you come to gloat?

1001
01:06:25,527 --> 01:06:26,528
Make it quick.

1002
01:06:31,616 --> 01:06:32,617
Hello, Sam.

1003
01:06:34,619 --> 01:06:35,620
Uncle Edmond.

1004
01:06:38,915 --> 01:06:40,834
It's been a long time
since I've heard my name.

1005
01:06:42,043 --> 01:06:43,795
How could you kill your brother?

1006
01:06:56,891 --> 01:06:58,309
It's an electric cage.

1007
01:06:59,144 --> 01:07:01,980
And this collar projects a field
that nullifies my power.

1008
01:07:03,314 --> 01:07:04,315
Come closer.

1009
01:07:08,862 --> 01:07:10,280
I loved my brother, you know?

1010
01:07:11,489 --> 01:07:14,159
But great causes demand great sacrifices.

1011
01:07:15,660 --> 01:07:16,911
You wanted power?

1012
01:07:17,662 --> 01:07:19,372
I wanted to tear down the monarchy

1013
01:07:19,456 --> 01:07:22,792
so that the people could live as citizens,
not subjects.

1014
01:07:24,753 --> 01:07:26,254
But your father wanted to wait.

1015
01:07:28,715 --> 01:07:31,676
He said that change takes time.

1016
01:07:32,510 --> 01:07:34,179
But that way nothing gets done.

1017
01:07:34,763 --> 01:07:36,097
So you murdered him.

1018
01:07:38,433 --> 01:07:41,311
You will never forgive me
for what I've done, Snowflake.

1019
01:07:43,188 --> 01:07:45,106
At least now you understand why.

1020
01:08:11,132 --> 01:08:12,133
El?

1021
01:08:12,884 --> 01:08:13,885
Sam.

1022
01:08:15,845 --> 01:08:17,055
Didn't realize you were back.

1023
01:08:18,390 --> 01:08:20,016
Summer school was a bust.

1024
01:08:20,600 --> 01:08:23,353
Hey, at least now you can help me
prepare for the coronation.

1025
01:08:23,436 --> 01:08:25,897
Just please don't be late for once.

1026
01:08:26,856 --> 01:08:28,900
You have no idea what I'm dealing with.

1027
01:08:28,983 --> 01:08:30,568
Do you think you have it tough?

1028
01:08:30,652 --> 01:08:33,279
You get to do whatever you like,

1029
01:08:33,363 --> 01:08:37,534
and I have to live up to everybody's
expectations because you never do.

1030
01:08:37,617 --> 01:08:39,786
I never asked you to do that for me.

1031
01:08:39,869 --> 01:08:41,079
You didn't have to.

1032
01:08:41,162 --> 01:08:42,539
What is that supposed to mean?

1033
01:08:45,792 --> 01:08:47,919
You were so young when dad died,

1034
01:08:48,461 --> 01:08:50,255
and you took it so hard.

1035
01:08:51,881 --> 01:08:56,594
I chose to be the perfect princess,
so you could just be free to be a kid.

1036
01:08:56,678 --> 01:09:01,099
And sure, there are some parts
of the kingdom that feel old-fashioned,

1037
01:09:01,808 --> 01:09:04,894
but I'm about to be
in a position to enact real change.

1038
01:09:05,437 --> 01:09:06,730
That means something to me,

1039
01:09:06,813 --> 01:09:09,774
and every time that you yell,
"Down with the monarchy,"

1040
01:09:09,858 --> 01:09:13,361
you are rebelling
against everything that I stand for!

1041
01:09:23,496 --> 01:09:26,166
I didn't realize
it was going to get this real, this fast.

1042
01:09:26,708 --> 01:09:28,585
Do you think Sam's coming back?

1043
01:09:28,668 --> 01:09:31,296
Maybe, or maybe not.
I mean, she almost got herself killed.

1044
01:09:31,379 --> 01:09:32,714
She almost got James killed.

1045
01:09:32,797 --> 01:09:34,424
Who even was that crazy guy?

1046
01:09:34,507 --> 01:09:37,302
I have a bad feeling we're gonna find out
sooner rather than later.

1047
01:09:38,386 --> 01:09:39,804
Well, what are we meant to do now?

1048
01:09:40,930 --> 01:09:42,015
Keep practicing.

1049
01:09:42,098 --> 01:09:43,308
They'll give us a new teacher.

1050
01:09:44,017 --> 01:09:46,853
-And what about the coronation?
-Sam said she'd get us in.

1051
01:09:46,936 --> 01:09:49,522
We should be there for her. Right?

1052
01:10:20,345 --> 01:10:21,346
You awake?

1053
01:10:22,514 --> 01:10:23,723
Yeah. I can't sleep either.

1054
01:10:24,224 --> 01:10:25,350
Yeah, I know why.

1055
01:10:25,433 --> 01:10:28,019
You're too excited to hang out
with Roxana at the coronation.

1056
01:10:28,103 --> 01:10:29,771
Be quiet.

1057
01:10:30,105 --> 01:10:32,565
What I'm actually thinking about
is what's gonna happen after that.

1058
01:10:33,149 --> 01:10:34,150
If we're gonna get in.

1059
01:10:34,901 --> 01:10:35,985
Into the Society?

1060
01:10:36,069 --> 01:10:37,112
Yeah.

1061
01:10:37,779 --> 01:10:39,030
For the first time in my life,

1062
01:10:39,114 --> 01:10:41,199
I feel I could do something
that actually matters.

1063
01:10:41,282 --> 01:10:42,283
And let's be honest,

1064
01:10:42,784 --> 01:10:46,705
royalty by day, superhero by night
sounds pretty dope.

1065
01:10:48,039 --> 01:10:51,251
No matter what happens,
I'm glad I got to meet you.

1066
01:10:52,043 --> 01:10:53,837
Hey, don't laugh.

1067
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:54,921
I'm not.

1068
01:10:55,547 --> 01:10:56,548
I feel the same way.

1069
01:10:58,883 --> 01:11:00,885
This has been one crazy summer.

1070
01:11:27,454 --> 01:11:28,621
Hey.

1071
01:11:30,582 --> 01:11:31,666
How are you feeling?

1072
01:11:32,667 --> 01:11:35,170
I'm a little sore still, but I'll be okay.

1073
01:11:36,338 --> 01:11:37,839
I brought you a snack.

1074
01:11:37,922 --> 01:11:40,342
Figured you could use a break
from hospital food.

1075
01:11:41,384 --> 01:11:44,262
Is this a bagel?
You really are trying to kill me.

1076
01:11:44,346 --> 01:11:46,473
Oh, don't worry. It's gluten-free.

1077
01:11:47,349 --> 01:11:50,518
-You remembered my allergy. Put it there.
- Mm-hmm.

1078
01:11:54,689 --> 01:11:58,902
I feel terrible about what happened.

1079
01:12:00,653 --> 01:12:05,283
You told me not to go after Edmond,
and I should've listened.

1080
01:12:07,660 --> 01:12:11,956
If it weren't for me,
you wouldn't even be in here.

1081
01:12:12,999 --> 01:12:16,211
Well, I am always right,

1082
01:12:16,878 --> 01:12:18,171
but I forgive you.

1083
01:12:21,049 --> 01:12:23,677
And I'm not entirely convinced
that Edmond was working alone.

1084
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:25,679
We may not have seen the end of this.

1085
01:12:30,600 --> 01:12:33,520
I was just starting to find my place...

1086
01:12:34,896 --> 01:12:35,897
you know?

1087
01:12:37,315 --> 01:12:40,568
I finally meet royals
I actually get along with,

1088
01:12:41,736 --> 01:12:43,738
and I was figuring out my powers.

1089
01:12:46,616 --> 01:12:48,618
And then it all falls apart.

1090
01:12:50,453 --> 01:12:51,496
Sam...

1091
01:12:52,914 --> 01:12:55,333
I'm a second-born too, remember?

1092
01:12:56,042 --> 01:12:57,585
I know what it's like to feel alone.

1093
01:12:59,254 --> 01:13:02,215
And, thankfully, there's, like, 20 of me
to keep me company, but...

1094
01:13:04,884 --> 01:13:06,302
You're meant for great things.

1095
01:13:08,388 --> 01:13:09,764
I really wanna believe that.

1096
01:13:11,725 --> 01:13:13,560
Well, I do, and you should.

1097
01:13:16,062 --> 01:13:19,149
And when the moment comes,
you'll be ready.

1098
01:13:22,318 --> 01:13:23,445
Enough of this mushy stuff.

1099
01:13:23,528 --> 01:13:25,280
Give me my bagel
and get out of here, okay?

1100
01:13:25,780 --> 01:13:26,781
Yeah.

1101
01:14:53,118 --> 01:14:54,953
Happy birthday, darling.

1102
01:14:59,833 --> 01:15:01,042
You look like a queen.

1103
01:15:06,464 --> 01:15:07,716
What if I'm not ready?

1104
01:15:13,013 --> 01:15:14,180
Can I tell you a secret?

1105
01:15:17,600 --> 01:15:19,436
I wasn't ready either.

1106
01:15:21,021 --> 01:15:23,064
Act like the leader
they believe you to be.

1107
01:15:25,650 --> 01:15:27,027
That's how you become one.

1108
01:15:56,348 --> 01:15:59,768
-Your Lordship, please. Thank you.
-

1109
01:16:14,574 --> 01:16:16,659
Props to Sam for coming through.

1110
01:16:16,743 --> 01:16:19,746
It's hard to impress me,
and even I'm impressed.

1111
01:16:20,246 --> 01:16:22,874
Every single important royal
in the world is here.

1112
01:16:23,667 --> 01:16:26,461
Is this not the most
beautiful thing you've ever seen?

1113
01:16:27,379 --> 01:16:28,546
It is.

1114
01:16:28,630 --> 01:16:29,839
Too bad James can't be here.

1115
01:16:31,883 --> 01:16:33,218
Hey, where's Sam anyway?

1116
01:16:33,301 --> 01:16:34,594
Probably helping Eleanor get ready.

1117
01:16:35,679 --> 01:16:38,223
Hey, excuse me, ma'am?
I'd love one of those mints.

1118
01:16:38,306 --> 01:16:39,641
It's my last one.

1119
01:16:40,642 --> 01:16:41,643
Please.

1120
01:16:45,647 --> 01:16:48,024
That's weird.
My powers aren't working.

1121
01:16:49,401 --> 01:16:50,402
Where's January?

1122
01:16:55,740 --> 01:16:56,991
This is a restricted area.

1123
01:16:57,075 --> 01:16:58,076
Oh, hi.

1124
01:16:58,159 --> 01:16:59,994
The queen sent me
to check on the prisoner.

1125
01:17:00,078 --> 01:17:01,705
We're gonna need confirmation.

1126
01:17:02,706 --> 01:17:04,541
Open the door, now.

1127
01:17:12,841 --> 01:17:16,219
The plan is working.
The apples were a brilliant idea.

1128
01:17:16,511 --> 01:17:19,472
Sorry, I'm late.
I had to steal Tuma's power.

1129
01:17:19,556 --> 01:17:20,640
Nicely done.

1130
01:17:22,225 --> 01:17:24,936
Epsilon 97 red Q zero.

1131
01:17:27,647 --> 01:17:30,567
None of them have any idea
that we're working together.

1132
01:17:30,650 --> 01:17:32,402
They truly suspect nothing.

1133
01:17:34,988 --> 01:17:35,989
Phase two.

1134
01:17:40,201 --> 01:17:42,203
Hey, there you are. Did you take my power?

1135
01:17:42,287 --> 01:17:44,122
Come with me. All of you.

1136
01:17:44,539 --> 01:17:46,374
Where? I don't wanna miss the coronation.

1137
01:17:46,458 --> 01:17:48,126
Yeah, you do. Where's Sam?

1138
01:17:48,209 --> 01:17:50,462
-How should I know? Give me back my p--
-Don't speak.

1139
01:17:50,545 --> 01:17:51,671
The rest of you too.

1140
01:18:03,600 --> 01:18:05,435
Scanning all systems.

1141
01:18:07,854 --> 01:18:10,523
Emergency alert systems deactivated.

1142
01:18:11,858 --> 01:18:13,860
Communications deactivated.

1143
01:18:15,487 --> 01:18:16,613
Stop.

1144
01:18:16,696 --> 01:18:19,449
The alarms and external communication's
been disconnected.

1145
01:18:20,617 --> 01:18:21,868
I disabled the master code.

1146
01:18:21,951 --> 01:18:23,286
Smart.

1147
01:18:23,370 --> 01:18:26,998
Even if Catherine figures out what's
going on, she won't be able to stop us.

1148
01:18:27,082 --> 01:18:29,334
We can still move in and out of here
using this pin.

1149
01:18:30,794 --> 01:18:31,878
Come with me.

1150
01:18:46,935 --> 01:18:48,978
Get in the cell. All of you.

1151
01:18:56,069 --> 01:18:57,362
You'll thank me later.

1152
01:19:13,503 --> 01:19:14,587
Matteo?

1153
01:19:28,435 --> 01:19:29,811
January, report.

1154
01:19:34,774 --> 01:19:36,651
I put the second-borns in your cell.

1155
01:19:36,735 --> 01:19:38,445
You're clear all the way to the target.

1156
01:19:38,528 --> 01:19:40,989
Excellent.
Everything is going according to plan.

1157
01:19:41,072 --> 01:19:42,907
Proceed to phase three.

1158
01:20:24,324 --> 01:20:25,450
We have a straggler.

1159
01:20:27,410 --> 01:20:29,245
Epsilon 97 red Q zero!

1160
01:20:29,329 --> 01:20:30,789
Sam knows something's up.

1161
01:20:32,248 --> 01:20:34,250
Catch her before she becomes a problem.

1162
01:20:39,464 --> 01:20:41,466
Security system linked.

1163
01:21:22,132 --> 01:21:25,468
- Nano-device activated.

1164
01:21:26,052 --> 01:21:28,596
Calibrating DNA target parameters.

1165
01:21:37,814 --> 01:21:44,487
There are moments in the life of every
leader and every parent that stand apart.

1166
01:21:44,904 --> 01:21:46,072
This is one of them.

1167
01:21:48,074 --> 01:21:50,869
I could not hope
for a more deserving successor...

1168
01:21:52,579 --> 01:21:54,080
and a more perfect daughter.

1169
01:22:11,639 --> 01:22:12,724
Hard way it is.

1170
01:22:19,189 --> 01:22:21,399
Mike! Mike, I know you're in there!

1171
01:22:22,442 --> 01:22:24,277
-Mike!
-Shouldn't you be at the coronation?

1172
01:22:24,361 --> 01:22:25,737
I need your help. It's important.

1173
01:22:25,820 --> 01:22:27,238
What? More important than our gig?

1174
01:22:27,322 --> 01:22:30,825
-Go ask your new best friend.
-Mike, I'm serious. People are in danger.

1175
01:22:30,909 --> 01:22:32,535
It's an emergency.

1176
01:22:32,619 --> 01:22:33,620
What kind of emergency?

1177
01:22:33,703 --> 01:22:34,871
I can't tell you.

1178
01:22:34,954 --> 01:22:36,331
Sounds familiar. Bye.

1179
01:22:36,414 --> 01:22:38,208
Wait. No, okay. I--

1180
01:22:38,291 --> 01:22:40,710
Remember how I could read the numbers
from really far away

1181
01:22:40,794 --> 01:22:42,212
and smell what you had for lunch?

1182
01:22:43,588 --> 01:22:44,714
Yeah, so?

1183
01:22:44,798 --> 01:22:48,301
Well, it turns out I have powers,
and summer school was a training program

1184
01:22:48,385 --> 01:22:51,346
for a secret society of royal superhumans
run by my mom.

1185
01:22:51,429 --> 01:22:53,181
My uncle killed my dad. He escaped jail.

1186
01:22:53,264 --> 01:22:55,892
My new best friend is his spy,
and she can mind control people.

1187
01:22:55,975 --> 01:22:57,227
And the palace is on lockdown,

1188
01:22:57,310 --> 01:23:00,605
and they're about to do something really
horrible to everyone at the coronation.

1189
01:23:15,954 --> 01:23:17,288
That was the worst story ever.

1190
01:23:18,289 --> 01:23:20,083
Thank you all for being here.

1191
01:23:21,126 --> 01:23:24,504
I've been preparing for this day
my entire life.

1192
01:23:25,797 --> 01:23:29,926
Queen of Illyria
is a great responsibility.

1193
01:23:49,154 --> 01:23:50,155
Stop.

1194
01:23:50,238 --> 01:23:51,781
I love this power.

1195
01:23:52,657 --> 01:23:53,658
Drop it.

1196
01:23:56,119 --> 01:23:57,328
Don't worry.

1197
01:23:58,038 --> 01:24:02,125
I'm not going to hurt you,
but I can't let you ruin things either.

1198
01:24:02,792 --> 01:24:04,294
You pretended to be my friend

1199
01:24:04,377 --> 01:24:06,588
so that I would show you
how to sneak into the palace.

1200
01:24:06,671 --> 01:24:09,799
Sorry, Sam. I made a deal with Edmond.

1201
01:24:10,425 --> 01:24:13,219
I help him, he gets rid of my brother.

1202
01:24:13,720 --> 01:24:15,472
We've been working together all along.

1203
01:24:15,972 --> 01:24:17,265
I deserve to rule.

1204
01:24:17,349 --> 01:24:19,601
And I can't kill my brother myself.

1205
01:24:19,684 --> 01:24:21,561
That would make me an awful person.

1206
01:24:23,188 --> 01:24:25,231
I'm just looking out for my kingdom.

1207
01:24:25,315 --> 01:24:27,275
Why did Edmond wanna get caught?

1208
01:24:27,359 --> 01:24:28,651
Aren't we nosy?

1209
01:24:30,070 --> 01:24:34,157
Let's just say, everyone of royal birth
at your sister's coronation

1210
01:24:34,240 --> 01:24:36,576
is about to have a really bad day.

1211
01:24:36,659 --> 01:24:40,038
I don't think I properly introduced you
to my best friend, Mike.

1212
01:24:42,582 --> 01:24:43,583
Bull's-eye.

1213
01:24:45,126 --> 01:24:46,211
I'm glad I believed you.

1214
01:24:46,294 --> 01:24:48,380
-Mike, I'm so sorry.
-It's okay.

1215
01:24:48,463 --> 01:24:49,464
All right. What now?

1216
01:24:50,090 --> 01:24:51,341
I have to save my family.

1217
01:24:52,175 --> 01:24:54,761
Wrong. We have to save your family.

1218
01:24:54,844 --> 01:24:57,013
Look, I know it's dangerous,
and I don't have powers,

1219
01:24:57,097 --> 01:24:59,099
but friends don't let friends
save the world by themselves.

1220
01:25:00,058 --> 01:25:01,142
Okay.

1221
01:25:26,876 --> 01:25:29,129
-You have a Batcave under your house?
-That's what I said.

1222
01:25:29,212 --> 01:25:30,213
Come on.

1223
01:25:33,883 --> 01:25:34,884
Sam!

1224
01:25:37,178 --> 01:25:38,847
The scary guy's on the loose.
And January--

1225
01:25:38,930 --> 01:25:40,682
I know. We have to go after Edmond.

1226
01:25:40,765 --> 01:25:43,518
-He's been working with January all along.
-Wait, who's Edmond?

1227
01:25:43,601 --> 01:25:46,730
-The scary guy. Also, her not-dead uncle.
-I knew that guy would come back.

1228
01:25:46,813 --> 01:25:48,898
-And who are you?
-Mike Kleinberg.

1229
01:25:48,982 --> 01:25:50,150
So...

1230
01:25:50,233 --> 01:25:51,443
He's my best friend.

1231
01:25:52,861 --> 01:25:54,279
Edmond wanted to get caught.

1232
01:25:54,362 --> 01:25:56,197
Coming after me at school was a ruse.

1233
01:25:56,281 --> 01:25:59,367
He needed something from this place.
Something only the Society--

1234
01:26:05,623 --> 01:26:09,169
DNA-based nano-device,
programmed to target specific genes.

1235
01:26:09,669 --> 01:26:12,047
-It's gone.
-One more time using small words.

1236
01:26:12,130 --> 01:26:14,424
Think of a device
that only works on certain people

1237
01:26:14,507 --> 01:26:17,802
who share specific genetic traits.
Like hazel eyes or freckles.

1238
01:26:17,886 --> 01:26:20,513
January said that everyone of royal birth
is about to have a bad day.

1239
01:26:20,597 --> 01:26:23,683
Edmond is going to unleash the device
at the coronation.

1240
01:26:23,767 --> 01:26:26,895
It'll wipe out everyone with a royal
bloodline, including my family.

1241
01:26:26,978 --> 01:26:29,189
-Well, we have to call for help.
- There's no one left to call.

1242
01:26:29,272 --> 01:26:30,440
James is in the hospital.

1243
01:26:30,523 --> 01:26:32,275
My mom is leading the coronation.

1244
01:26:33,360 --> 01:26:34,444
This one's on us.

1245
01:26:34,527 --> 01:26:36,363
There's a way
we can use the device to stop him.

1246
01:26:36,863 --> 01:26:38,531
You want us to go up against him?

1247
01:26:38,907 --> 01:26:40,408
We have something he doesn't.

1248
01:26:41,326 --> 01:26:43,078
He's alone. We are a team.

1249
01:26:43,161 --> 01:26:47,540
He's more powerful than any of us,
but he's not more powerful than all of us.

1250
01:26:48,416 --> 01:26:50,126
-Who's with me?
- Let's do this.

1251
01:26:50,210 --> 01:26:51,378
Obviously, I'm in.

1252
01:26:51,461 --> 01:26:52,629
I can't sit this one out.

1253
01:26:52,712 --> 01:26:54,381
Edmond wore a collar in custody.

1254
01:26:54,464 --> 01:26:56,466
It radiates a field that cancels powers.

1255
01:26:56,549 --> 01:26:58,259
So, we just have to
put it around his neck?

1256
01:26:59,135 --> 01:27:00,595
Without him killing us with his pinkie.

1257
01:27:00,679 --> 01:27:04,015
Or we get the other collars from his cell,
and we build a trap.

1258
01:27:04,099 --> 01:27:04,974
Here's the plan.

1259
01:27:06,101 --> 01:27:07,185
We split up.

1260
01:27:07,268 --> 01:27:09,270
That way he won't see us coming.

1261
01:27:09,354 --> 01:27:10,939
Tuma, you climb up the elevator cable.

1262
01:27:12,565 --> 01:27:13,441
Why can't I ride it?

1263
01:27:14,150 --> 01:27:16,486
He'll hear it coming
and send it crashing to the ground.

1264
01:27:16,569 --> 01:27:18,613
-Oh.
-I'll take the north air duct.

1265
01:27:22,909 --> 01:27:24,619
Sweet.
I'll free-climb the side of the palace.

1266
01:27:24,703 --> 01:27:25,995
Sounds dangerous.

1267
01:27:26,705 --> 01:27:28,248
Relax. I'm invisible.

1268
01:27:29,290 --> 01:27:30,583
I'm just gonna take the stairs.

1269
01:27:32,043 --> 01:27:33,336
All right. Well, what about me?

1270
01:27:33,420 --> 01:27:36,756
You and Matteo
are the most crucial part of the plan.

1271
01:27:41,553 --> 01:27:43,388
Ready for deployment.

1272
01:28:02,699 --> 01:28:03,700
Don't do it.

1273
01:28:06,286 --> 01:28:08,455
Eleanor hasn't done anything to you.

1274
01:28:09,122 --> 01:28:12,000
And neither have
any of the people in there.

1275
01:28:12,083 --> 01:28:14,252
This is the new beginning.

1276
01:28:15,045 --> 01:28:19,049
Freedom. And not only for Illyria,
but for the other kingdoms as well.

1277
01:28:19,132 --> 01:28:21,134
It's a world without royals.

1278
01:28:22,052 --> 01:28:23,094
Isn't that what you want?

1279
01:28:24,054 --> 01:28:25,055
Not like this.

1280
01:28:27,515 --> 01:28:29,100
This isn't freedom.

1281
01:28:29,726 --> 01:28:30,727
It's murder.

1282
01:28:32,812 --> 01:28:34,773
Time is running out, Snowflake.

1283
01:28:35,982 --> 01:28:37,942
And you cannot defeat me.

1284
01:28:39,110 --> 01:28:40,111
Not by myself.

1285
01:28:41,988 --> 01:28:44,282
Disarm the device. Surrender now.

1286
01:28:44,366 --> 01:28:46,284
You're not powerful enough to control me.

1287
01:28:46,368 --> 01:28:47,994
I know, dude, but I made you look.

1288
01:28:50,622 --> 01:28:51,998
Give it. Give it. I'm right here!

1289
01:28:52,082 --> 01:28:52,957
-Tuma!
-Roxana!

1290
01:29:12,811 --> 01:29:13,853
Come on!

1291
01:29:19,776 --> 01:29:20,735
Yes!

1292
01:30:08,033 --> 01:30:10,660
Do you swear
to uphold the laws of Illyria?

1293
01:30:11,119 --> 01:30:12,120
I do.

1294
01:30:42,484 --> 01:30:43,485
Hi.

1295
01:30:44,611 --> 01:30:46,404
-Not gonna happen.

1296
01:30:47,155 --> 01:30:50,325
We brought the collars from your cell.
Your powers aren't gonna work in here.

1297
01:30:50,950 --> 01:30:53,953
And without your powers, it's game over.

1298
01:30:55,830 --> 01:30:57,165
Give me that or we're both gonna die.

1299
01:30:57,248 --> 01:30:59,167
You programmed this thing
to target royals.

1300
01:30:59,250 --> 01:31:01,628
But we reprogrammed it to trap you.

1301
01:31:12,847 --> 01:31:14,641
Activation imminent.

1302
01:31:15,934 --> 01:31:16,935
Three.

1303
01:31:17,560 --> 01:31:18,561
Two.

1304
01:31:18,895 --> 01:31:20,355
One.

1305
01:31:45,839 --> 01:31:47,882
- Subject acquired.

1306
01:31:47,966 --> 01:31:50,468
Sam! It's over.

1307
01:31:51,052 --> 01:31:52,470
Your plan worked. We got him.

1308
01:31:53,722 --> 01:31:55,223
Rise a queen.

1309
01:32:34,596 --> 01:32:35,764
Congratulations.

1310
01:32:35,847 --> 01:32:38,600
Nothing is impossible
if you work together.

1311
01:32:38,683 --> 01:32:40,310
Welcome to The Secret Society.

1312
01:32:40,393 --> 01:32:42,479
I had faith in you guys
from the beginning.

1313
01:32:42,979 --> 01:32:46,107
Go ahead, take your pins.
You've earned them.

1314
01:32:47,442 --> 01:32:50,904
Hey, Charlie. Give me a kiss,
give me a kiss, give me a kiss.

1315
01:32:51,738 --> 01:32:55,241
I've gotta say, James, dope idea
having me practice on Charlie.

1316
01:32:56,117 --> 01:32:57,494
I have a confession to make.

1317
01:32:57,577 --> 01:33:00,997
Your power only works on humans, not dogs.

1318
01:33:01,081 --> 01:33:03,875
Charlie obeys your commands
because he likes you.

1319
01:33:04,542 --> 01:33:05,877
So what was the point?

1320
01:33:05,960 --> 01:33:08,505
To make you care about something
other than yourself.

1321
01:33:14,344 --> 01:33:15,261
El.

1322
01:33:15,345 --> 01:33:18,264
I just wanna tell you how grateful
I am for what you and your friends did.

1323
01:33:18,765 --> 01:33:19,933
Mom told me everything.

1324
01:33:20,684 --> 01:33:22,936
She doesn't want
any more secrets in our family.

1325
01:33:24,354 --> 01:33:27,065
Well, it was my turn to protect you.

1326
01:33:29,234 --> 01:33:31,277
I'm sorry about what I said earlier.

1327
01:33:31,361 --> 01:33:33,697
You're not wrong
that some things do need to change.

1328
01:33:34,698 --> 01:33:36,491
For my first order as queen,

1329
01:33:36,574 --> 01:33:38,952
I'm giving the people of Illyria a choice

1330
01:33:39,035 --> 01:33:43,623
of having a parliament
alongside the monarchy.

1331
01:33:43,707 --> 01:33:45,625
We're more alike than you think.

1332
01:33:51,256 --> 01:33:54,843
A few hours ago, a bank in Geneva
considered impenetrable was robbed.

1333
01:33:54,926 --> 01:33:57,595
Our intel suggests the funds may be used
to finance a coup.

1334
01:33:57,679 --> 01:34:00,974
We recovered a partial fingerprint.
It matched to our database.

1335
01:34:01,057 --> 01:34:05,270
As you know, we have Edmond in custody,
but January remains free.

1336
01:34:06,354 --> 01:34:08,106
She left that print on purpose.

1337
01:34:08,189 --> 01:34:11,568
It's a message.
"Come and get me if you can."

1338
01:34:11,651 --> 01:34:13,319
You're going to do just that.

1339
01:34:13,403 --> 01:34:14,404
The jet is fueled.

1340
01:34:14,487 --> 01:34:16,072
Whoa. We have a jet?
-Wheels up in ten.

1341
01:34:17,657 --> 01:34:18,658
Be careful out there.

1342
01:34:19,576 --> 01:34:20,785
We got this, Mom.

1343
01:34:20,869 --> 01:34:22,162
I know you do.

1344
01:34:26,624 --> 01:34:30,170
I've trained some very impressive
second-born royals in my day,

1345
01:34:31,004 --> 01:34:35,133
but this class, they may just be
our most promising operatives yet.

1346
01:34:36,217 --> 01:34:37,260
Pretty cool, huh?

1347
01:34:40,597 --> 01:34:43,641
Well, what are you waiting for?
A royal invitation? Let's go.

1348
01:35:39,447 --> 01:35:42,826
Get in now

1349
01:35:52,752 --> 01:35:55,922
To meet me

1350
01:36:02,971 --> 01:36:05,223
With you

1351
01:36:11,521 --> 01:36:12,939
-

1352
01:36:15,108 --> 01:36:18,361
-

1353
01:36:19,612 --> 01:36:22,699
-

1354
01:36:22,782 --> 01:36:24,951
Yeah I'm coming for you

1355
01:36:42,469 --> 01:36:45,138
Yeah I'm coming for you

1356
01:36:55,774 --> 01:36:58,360
Yeah I'm coming for you
