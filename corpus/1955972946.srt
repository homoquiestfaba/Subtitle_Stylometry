I am working with the
station attorney.

my ridiculous ref award

- He has a case.
- A stupid case.

366
00:19:06,633 --> 00:19:09,276
But still a case.

367
00:19:09,300 --> 00:19:10,833
What did Tony say?

368
00:19:12,700 --> 00:19:15,276
He said I should plead out
as quickly as possible

back on the air.

370

No, he's not right.

isn't interested in money.

time would be unwarranted,

385

Prosecutor, what
are you thinking?

391
00:20:24,967 --> 00:20:27,809
Community service
and restitution.

392
00:20:27,833 --> 00:20:30,876
So you want to put a bloody
nose through my court system

393
00:20:30,900 --> 00:20:34,276
so that he can watch this fellow
pick up trash along the highway?

394
00:20:34,300 --> 00:20:35,943
Your honor, the
victim was publicly

395
00:20:35,967 --> 00:20:38,076
called out and humiliated.

396
00:20:38,100 --> 00:20:40,076
And injured.

397
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:42,476
He had to have his family
Christmas picture taken

398
00:20:42,500 --> 00:20:45,076
with this bandage on his nose.

399
00:20:45,100 --> 00:20:46,076

not your wallet.

00:20:49,100 --> 00:20:51,209
the ridiculous ref of
the week award, huh?

403
00:20:51,233 --> 00:20:53,209
Is that what all this is about?

404
00:20:53,233 --> 00:20:55,209
We'll take it. We'll
take community service.

405

Okay, then community service
and restitution it is.

411

They don't put people on the
road crews in December.

412
00:21:13,167 --> 00:21:16,676
Something as public as my
incident would be preferred.

413
00:21:16,700 --> 00:21:19,276
Well, it's Christmas.

414
00:21:19,300 --> 00:21:21,500
The army can always use a
little help this time of year.

415
00:21:21,524 --> 00:21:23,476
The army?

416
00:21:23,500 --> 00:21:24,676
You can't do that.

417
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,809
Report tomorrow to major lowell.

418
00:21:26,833 --> 00:21:29,276
I'll tell him to expect you.

419

off the court, okay?

Sit down.

428
00:23:02,800 --> 00:23:04,443
You play an instrument?

429
00:23:04,467 --> 00:23:08,709
I took saxophone
in middle school.

430
00:23:08,733 --> 00:23:13,967
It was hardly a
community service.

431
00:23:14,067 --> 00:23:17,467
I think I know exactly
where you can help us out.

432
00:23:18,733 --> 00:23:22,243
Oh no, no, no, not bells.

433
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:25,243
Oh, no, no bells if
that's okay with you.

434
00:23:25,267 --> 00:23:26,843
Why not?

435
00:23:26,867 --> 00:23:28,776
You know, I can sort
things at a thrift shop,

436
00:23:28,800 --> 00:23:30,776
you know, old things?

437
00:23:30,800 --> 00:23:33,267
I'm good at sorting.

438
00:23:34,133 --> 00:23:37,443
My wife taught me
how to wash dishes.

439
00:23:37,467 --> 00:23:39,376
I'll bet you have
a soup kitchen.

440
00:23:39,400 --> 00:23:42,176
Why not bell ringing?

441
00:23:42,200 --> 00:23:43,667
Well...

442
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,109
You know, people recognize
me when I'm out and about,

443
00:23:48,133 --> 00:23:49,109
you know, from the news,

444
00:23:49,133 --> 00:23:53,309
and it sure might become
a huge distraction.

445
00:23:53,333 --> 00:23:57,509
People like to see someone
they know at the kettle.

446
00:23:57,533 --> 00:24:02,709
Honestly, I don't want
to see people I know.

447
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:04,576
I think that's sad.

448
00:24:04,600 --> 00:24:08,576
A lot of people
enjoy bell ringing.

449
00:24:08,600 --> 00:24:13,243
We got local service clubs who
hold a friendly competition

450
00:24:13,267 --> 00:24:14,909
to see who can ring more.

451
00:24:14,933 --> 00:24:16,333
More power to 'em.

452
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:20,843
Sorry, Bruce.

453
00:24:20,867 --> 00:24:23,200
Judge's orders.

454
00:24:24,867 --> 00:24:27,243

455
00:24:27,267 --> 00:24:30,443

463
00:25:07,533 --> 00:25:08,509
You said it would be cold.

464
00:25:08,533 --> 00:25:12,109
I didn't say we were
robbing a bank.

465
00:25:12,133 --> 00:25:15,176
Well, I've gotta protect my
skin from windburn, you know?

466
00:25:15,200 --> 00:25:17,309
I'm on the air, you know?

467
00:25:17,333 --> 00:25:20,467
Not until your community
service is up.

468
00:25:25,067 --> 00:25:26,776
And I think the ski
mask definitely gives

469
00:25:26,800 --> 00:25:29,509
the "don't approach me" vibe.

470
00:25:29,533 --> 00:25:31,600
Alright, alright.

471
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:34,709

473
00:25:39,733 --> 00:25:41,509
and of course, your bell.

474
00:25:41,533 --> 00:25:43,576
And don't ring it too much.

475
00:25:43,600 --> 00:25:45,576
Just enough for
people to notice.

476
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:48,176
A friendly smile.

477
00:25:48,200 --> 00:25:50,176

and say "merry Christmas."

a bell, alright?

483

the ref in the nose.

No, that's not true.

Derek talk to you?

901

01:19:29,633 --> 01:19:33,076
Anybody can see what's
happening on the field.

1420
01:19:33,100 --> 01:19:34,076
Maybe we should talk about

1421
01:19:34,100 --> 01:19:37,809

behind the scenes?

1423

what are some traditions
you have with your family?

1424
01:19:47,700 --> 01:19:51,276
Well...

1425
01:19:51,300 --> 01:19:53,476
Well, Christmas is a great
time of year for my family.

1426
01:19:53,500 --> 01:19:55,476
I mean, we always help out

1427
01:19:55,500 --> 01:19:56,476
with the salvation
army gift center,

1428
01:19:56,500 --> 01:19:58,609
and we do it every year.

1429
01:19:58,633 --> 01:20:00,143
I mean, we never miss it.

1430
01:20:00,167 --> 01:20:02,009
You know, we also
help distribute

1431
01:20:02,033 --> 01:20:04,076
some of the food boxes, as well.

1432
01:20:04,100 --> 01:20:07,676
And why is that so
important to you?

1433
01:20:07,700 --> 01:20:10,076
That's how I got my start.

1434
01:20:10,100 --> 01:20:12,367
In football?

1435
01:20:15,033 --> 01:20:17,767
In life.

1436
01:20:20,033 --> 01:20:22,009
You know, I'll never forget it.

1437
01:20:22,033 --> 01:20:23,209
I was about 6 years old.

1438
01:20:23,233 --> 01:20:28,876
My mom, she got hurt on the
job, so she couldn't work.

1439
01:20:28,900 --> 01:20:30,009
Me and my brothers,

1440
01:20:30,033 --> 01:20:32,276
we didn't think we'd have
much of a Christmas at all,

1441
01:20:32,300 --> 01:20:35,276
but one day, these two guys
in funny-looking uniforms,

1442
01:20:35,300 --> 01:20:36,609
they came to our porch

1443
01:20:36,633 --> 01:20:39,743
and they had these big
boxes of food and Turkey

1444
01:20:39,767 --> 01:20:41,209
and those potatoes in a box,

1445
01:20:41,233 --> 01:20:43,209
which I thought tasted
like cardboard,

1446
01:20:43,233 --> 01:20:44,209
but I still liked 'em, you know?

1447
01:20:44,233 --> 01:20:46,543
It was a feast.

1448
01:20:46,567 --> 01:20:50,609
Then these guys gave
us some presents.

1449
01:20:50,633 --> 01:20:56,143
They were wrapped up
in these big bows.

1450
01:20:56,167 --> 01:20:58,143
I'll never forget
what they told us.

1451
01:20:58,167 --> 01:21:03,943
They said that, "it's
because Jesus loves us."

1452
01:21:03,967 --> 01:21:07,809
That's why we're giving
you this stuff."

1453
01:21:07,833 --> 01:21:12,609
Every year after that, when
we started to do better,

1454
01:21:12,633 --> 01:21:16,043
we made sure we helped
other kids get those boxes

1455
01:21:16,067 --> 01:21:18,233
with those big bows.

1456
01:21:21,300 --> 01:21:22,676

1457

What was in your box?

1458
01:21:26,833 --> 01:21:28,567
