Hyperion?

45

Hang tight a bit.

75

Tethered gravity spin is starting.
You're a go, Hyperion.

76
00:07:29,375 --> 00:07:31,375
Artificial gravity is climbing.

77
00:07:37,458 --> 00:07:39,500
Looks like we'll hit close to five G's.

78
00:07:45,916 --> 00:07:47,000
Tether's unspooling.

00:08:44,916 --> 00:08:47,666
Thank you for the launch, Jim.
See you again at the first check.

Are you kidding me? That was incredible!

- [Zoe] I got it. Yeah.
- Oh. Thanks.

Oh, God.

97
00:10:26,375 --> 00:10:28,916
Okay, Zoe, you take this one.
David, you start working in the back.

98
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:29,958
- This one?
- [David] Copy.

99
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,541
- I'll be in the last wing.
- [Zoe] Copy that.

100
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,083
- Hey. [knocks on wall]
- [David] Hey.

101
00:11:28,791 --> 00:11:31,250
- [Zoe] How you feeling?
- Uh...

102
00:11:32,125 --> 00:11:34,125
- You need anything?
- I'll be all right.

103
00:11:34,208 --> 00:11:35,041
A beer?

104
00:11:35,708 --> 00:11:36,625
So thoughtful.

[mugs clinking]

108
00:13:19,791 --> 00:13:20,625
This will help.

109
00:13:21,541 --> 00:13:22,375
Thanks, Zo.

- What?

{\an8}- [David] Really?
- What are you...? I'm not...

113
00:13:48,416 --> 00:13:50,458
{\an8}Commander, how did she get Payloads
to allow this?

114
00:13:50,541 --> 00:13:53,500
{\an8}I don't even know anybody at Payloads,
so how would I...?

115
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,791
You wasted, what, 800 grams

116
00:13:56,875 --> 00:13:59,458
of your allowable personal effects
on these?

117
00:13:59,541 --> 00:14:00,416
Mm-hm.

118
00:14:00,500 --> 00:14:03,916
- You don't even care about the rivalry.
- No. But you do, David.

[Barnett chuckling]

120
00:14:05,708 --> 00:14:06,916
Oh, it's so easy.

121
00:14:08,500 --> 00:14:09,333
Okay.

122
00:14:10,833 --> 00:14:11,958
Five hours down...

[Barnett chuckles]

125

As your doctor,
I'm telling you to drink that.

[Zoe reading softly]

- [David clears throat]
- "Applicable"? "Applicable"?

128

- [David] "Applicable" is British.
- Is it?

129
00:14:34,333 --> 00:14:35,833
- How do I look?
- Stunning.

130
00:14:36,500 --> 00:14:38,333
No. I'm serious. This is a big deal.

131
00:14:38,416 --> 00:14:40,583
You look good. You look fine, seriously.
You look good.

Oh. Good.

134
00:14:44,500 --> 00:14:47,041
Uh, yes, we do.
We read you loud and clear.

135
00:14:47,125 --> 00:14:49,041
Welcome to <i>MTS-42.</i>

136
00:14:49,125 --> 00:14:51,541
[man speaking indistinctly over earpieces]

137
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:55,541
Oh, yeah. We did. Um...

138
00:14:55,625 --> 00:14:58,875
It's not uncommon to experience
a few hiccups during the launch,

139
00:14:58,958 --> 00:15:02,416
but due to the preparation
and expertise of our ground team,

140
00:15:02,500 --> 00:15:05,583
we had a smooth rendezvous
with the MTS Cycler.

141
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,500
[man speaking indistinctly]

142
00:15:11,666 --> 00:15:13,000
That's true. Um...

143
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,083
It's bittersweet.

144
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:18,625
I've had the honor of participating
in two missions to date.

145
00:15:18,708 --> 00:15:21,500
<i>And I couldn't be working
with a more talented crew on this,</i>

146
00:15:21,583 --> 00:15:23,625
<i>my final and third mission.</i>

147
00:15:23,708 --> 00:15:25,708
[man speaking indistinctly]

148
00:15:26,416 --> 00:15:28,666
Um... well, it's only been a few hours,

149
00:15:28,750 --> 00:15:31,208
<i>but it's already
a life-changing experience.</i>

150

[Zoe] <i>This isn't where</i>
<i>I thought I would end up.</i>

153
00:15:40,583 --> 00:15:43,708
<i>To me, my career was gonna be research</i>
<i>on Earth. </i>[chuckles]

154
00:15:43,791 --> 00:15:45,916
<i>You never know
where life's gonna take you.</i>

155
00:15:47,750 --> 00:15:50,208
Yes, I applied to the HARP program
because I thought

156
00:15:50,291 --> 00:15:53,125
it would be a funny story
to be rejected by Hyperion.

157
00:15:53,208 --> 00:15:54,250
[David & Barnett chuckle]

158
00:15:54,333 --> 00:15:57,666
[Zoe] <i>But now I realize</i>
<i>this is one of those rare opportunities</i>

[man speaking indistinctly]

161
00:16:05,041 --> 00:16:08,166
Well, space exploration has always led
to amazing medical discoveries

162
00:16:08,250 --> 00:16:10,750
that are... applicable
to the people on Earth.

- [David clears throat]
- [man speaking indistinctly]

164
00:16:14,458 --> 00:16:17,875
Well, uh, the launch was incredible.

165
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:22,625
It does take a little while
to get adjusted to the artificial gravity.

166

[man speaking indistinctly]

167
00:16:28,541 --> 00:16:31,291
[David] <i>Well, two years is a long time</i>
<i>to be away from my wife,</i>

168
00:16:31,375 --> 00:16:34,083
but this
is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

169
00:16:34,166 --> 00:16:36,166
I am so grateful to have her support.

[man speaking indistinctly]

171
00:16:38,375 --> 00:16:39,958
[David] <i>My research is integral</i>

172
00:16:40,041 --> 00:16:42,916
<i>to maintaining and sustaining life
on Mars long-term.</i>

173
00:16:43,625 --> 00:16:47,791
<i>We are taking the first steps

[man speaking indistinctly]

175
00:16:50,750 --> 00:16:52,583
Uh, no. No, not at all.

176
00:16:52,666 --> 00:16:57,625
I mean, out of the thousands of proposals
submitted from university students

177
00:16:57,708 --> 00:17:01,791
<i>and professors all around the world,
these two definitely rose to the top.</i>

178
00:17:01,875 --> 00:17:05,000
<i>I'm more than confident in their ability
and their training.</i>

179
00:17:05,541 --> 00:17:08,166
I know they can handle anything
that comes their way.

00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,750
[machine powering up]

00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:48,000

00:18:33,875 --> 00:18:35,166
Holy shit.

193
00:18:35,250 --> 00:18:37,250
- [David] Are you okay?
- Get him off! Get him off!

194
00:18:37,333 --> 00:18:38,208
What is going on?

195
00:18:38,291 --> 00:18:39,750
- [Barnett] Get him off!
- Are you okay?

196
00:18:39,833 --> 00:18:41,875
- [David] Is he alive?
- [Barnett] Just pull him up.

197
00:18:42,375 --> 00:18:43,375
Get him off.

198
00:18:44,250 --> 00:18:46,333
[Zoe]
Stop. Let's get him to the infirmary.

199
00:18:46,416 --> 00:18:47,250
I got him.

200
00:18:47,333 --> 00:18:50,416
- [David] Ready. [grunts]
- Ready? One, two, three. [grunts]

201
00:18:57,708 --> 00:18:59,083
- [David] Here?
- [Zoe] Yeah.

202
00:19:05,791 --> 00:19:06,750
[Zoe] That's good.

203
00:19:07,333 --> 00:19:09,583
- [David] Who the hell is this?
- Come on.

[gasps]

209
00:19:30,750 --> 00:19:33,291
- [Zoe] David, put some gloves on.
- [David] Copy.

210
00:19:46,375 --> 00:19:47,291
[Zoe] <i>Hold that closed.</i>

211
00:19:47,375 --> 00:19:49,666
- Just hold it as closed as you can.
- Wow.

212
00:19:50,791 --> 00:19:51,750
[Zoe] That's great.

213
00:19:53,250 --> 00:19:55,958
[Barnett] <i>The damage is contained</i>

00:19:59,875 --> 00:20:02,208
There's a breach in the hull.
Getting all this?

216
00:20:02,291 --> 00:20:04,333
- [Jim speaking indistinctly over earpiece]
- Good.

217
00:20:04,916 --> 00:20:07,958
Hey, Jim. Who the fuck is on my ship?

218
00:20:09,000 --> 00:20:10,375
[Jim speaking indistinctly]

219
00:20:10,458 --> 00:20:14,000
Yeah. He's still unconscious,
but I mean... is he a threat?

220
00:20:14,083 --> 00:20:16,625
Do we need to, I don't know, find a way

221
00:20:16,708 --> 00:20:17,833
to restrain him or...?

222
00:20:19,250 --> 00:20:21,250
[whirring]

223
00:20:29,666 --> 00:20:31,000
Any idea if he'll wake up?

224
00:20:32,416 --> 00:20:34,500
Honestly, I'm surprised he's still alive.

225
00:20:43,541 --> 00:20:44,625
[David sighs]

226
00:20:45,208 --> 00:20:47,166
His name is Michael Adams.

227
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:49,166
All they know for now
is that he's launch support.

228
00:20:50,791 --> 00:20:54,041
- [Zoe] How the hell was he missed?
- [Barnett] They're looking into it.

229
00:20:54,125 --> 00:20:56,000
We don't make mistakes like this.

230
00:20:56,083 --> 00:20:59,000
- Did he stow away on purpose?
- [Barnett] Hyperion doesn't know that yet.

231
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:05,916
[Zoe] How are you not screaming in pain
right now?

232
00:21:07,083 --> 00:21:09,750
It... hurts.

233
00:21:10,916 --> 00:21:12,083
This is pretty serious.

234
00:21:13,666 --> 00:21:17,333
- [Barnett] How long?
- [Zoe] To be safe, six weeks at least.

235
00:21:23,875 --> 00:21:25,416
[buzzing]

236
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:29,291
- CO2 is up 2 percent.
- [David] How?

237
00:21:30,125 --> 00:21:31,291
The CDRA is turned off.

238
00:21:31,375 --> 00:21:34,708
We shut down the entire functional module,
including life support.

239
00:21:34,791 --> 00:21:37,208
Let's get started
on the lithium-hydroxide canisters.

240
00:21:37,291 --> 00:21:38,125
Yeah. Roger.

241
00:21:49,916 --> 00:21:53,791
The breathing masks in the exercise room
are attached to the CDRA, as well,

242
00:21:53,875 --> 00:21:58,125
so let's just hold off on exercise
till we sort this out.

243
00:21:58,208 --> 00:21:59,666
- Copy.
- Copy that, commander.

244
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:08,791
We're good to go.

245
00:22:08,875 --> 00:22:10,875

Oh, fuck.

252
00:23:20,250 --> 00:23:22,083
Ahh. Jeez.

253
00:23:28,625 --> 00:23:29,625
[sighs]

254
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,208
[gasping]

255
00:24:16,708 --> 00:24:17,708
[Zoe] Hey. Sit down.

256
00:24:17,791 --> 00:24:19,125
- Did we take off?
- Hey, sit down.

257
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,416
- Did we take off?
- Sit down or you're gonna pass out.

258
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,083
- Did we...?
- Hey, you're okay.

259
00:24:23,166 --> 00:24:26,833
- Did we take off? No, no, no. [groans]
- Listen. You're fine. You're safe. No.

260
00:24:26,916 --> 00:24:30,875
- You're safe. You're fine. Commander!
- No, no. Did we take off? Did we take off?

261
00:24:34,125 --> 00:24:36,250
[Zoe] Okay, let's take deep breaths.
Take deep breaths.

262
00:24:36,333 --> 00:24:38,083
In through your nose,
out through your mouth.

263
00:24:38,166 --> 00:24:40,458
- [Michael panting]
- Just like I'm doing. Great. Michael?

264
00:24:40,541 --> 00:24:42,708
It's Michael, right? Michael, I'm Zoe.
I'm a doctor.

265
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:44,958
I want you to focus
on slowing down your breathing.

266
00:24:45,041 --> 00:24:47,708
Just nice and slow. Okay?
I'm gonna check your stitches.

267
00:24:47,791 --> 00:24:49,125
- Is that okay?
- [Michael] Stitches?

268
00:24:49,208 --> 00:24:50,625
- Nice and slow. Nice and slow.
- What?

269
00:24:50,708 --> 00:24:52,875
You got injured during the launch
just on your side here.

270
00:24:52,958 --> 00:24:53,833
- Is that okay?
- Uh-huh.

271
00:24:53,916 --> 00:24:56,083
I'm just gonna take a look. Ready?
All good.

272
00:24:56,958 --> 00:24:57,791
Okay.

273
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:00,083
- [Michael grunts]
- That's great.

274
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,125
Okay. You're good. You're good.

275
00:25:04,833 --> 00:25:07,458
Just nice and slow.
Slow your heart rate down.

276
00:25:08,083 --> 00:25:09,333
- Okay?
- [Michael] Yeah.

277
00:25:09,416 --> 00:25:10,375
- Okay.
- Great.

278
00:25:11,958 --> 00:25:13,291
- [Michael] Sorry.
- No. You're okay.

279
00:25:13,375 --> 00:25:15,708
It's okay. Hi. Hi, Michael.
I'm Marina Barnett.

280
00:25:15,791 --> 00:25:19,500
I'm the commander of the ship.
Do you mind if I ask you a few questions?

281
00:25:20,375 --> 00:25:21,958
[Michael] No. No, I don't mind.

282
00:25:24,083 --> 00:25:26,291
- Do you work for Hyperion?
- [Michael] Yes.

283
00:25:27,958 --> 00:25:31,250
- I'm a launch support engineer, ma'am.
- Okay.

284
00:25:31,333 --> 00:25:33,750
And do you remember what happened
on the pad?

285
00:25:36,666 --> 00:25:39,208
[Michael] Uh... Yes. I was, um...

286
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:42,000
I was, uh...

287
00:25:43,458 --> 00:25:48,250
I was arming the second-stage firing pins,
and I thought I was...

288
00:25:49,666 --> 00:25:51,541
I thought I was buckled in and, um...

289
00:25:52,500 --> 00:25:54,583
- No.
- You've had a concussion. This is normal.

290
00:25:54,666 --> 00:25:56,791
- This is fine.
- I thought I was clipped in.

291
00:25:56,875 --> 00:25:58,375
[Zoe] It's okay if you don't remember.

292
00:26:01,416 --> 00:26:02,750
How long was I...?

293
00:26:02,833 --> 00:26:03,791
How long was I out?

294
00:26:06,666 --> 00:26:08,250
We took off about 12 hours ago.

295
00:26:10,625 --> 00:26:11,541
Twelve hours.

296
00:26:15,708 --> 00:26:18,458
- I need to get back to my sister. Please.
- [Zoe] No.

297
00:26:18,541 --> 00:26:21,875
- She's alone. I gotta get back.
- Michael. I hear you, Michael,

298
00:26:21,958 --> 00:26:24,166
- but we're not going back.
- What do you mean?

299
00:26:24,250 --> 00:26:26,958
- This is a two-year mission. Please.
- I understand.

300
00:26:27,041 --> 00:26:29,083
- I need to get back. Now.
- Michael. Nice and slow.

301
00:26:29,166 --> 00:26:32,041
We're moving too fast.
We don't have enough fuel to turn around.

302
00:26:32,125 --> 00:26:34,625
- I gotta get back home.
- I understand. I do.

303
00:26:34,708 --> 00:26:37,875
Let me go and relay this to Hyperion.
I'm just gonna be a few minutes. Okay?

304
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:39,958
- I'll be right back. Okay?
- [panting]

305
00:26:40,041 --> 00:26:41,083
- Yeah.
- [Barnett] Stay here.

306
00:26:41,166 --> 00:26:43,666
- [David] Yes, commander.
- [Zoe] We're gonna figure this out, okay?

307
00:26:43,750 --> 00:26:46,291
And I just need you to keep breathing
while we figure it out. Okay?

308
00:26:46,375 --> 00:26:48,958
Can you just do that?
Slow that breathing back down.

309
00:27:00,541 --> 00:27:01,500
[Zoe] <i>He's stable.</i>

310
00:27:01,583 --> 00:27:04,666
He just needs some time alone to rest
and process everything.

311
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:06,708
[Barnett] Copy.

312
00:27:08,541 --> 00:27:10,416
- Do you need a hand?
- No, I'm fine.

313
00:27:57,916 --> 00:28:00,083
- [Michael grunts]
- [Zoe] Michael.

314
00:28:00,166 --> 00:28:01,250
- [David] Hey.
- [Michael] Hey.

315
00:28:01,333 --> 00:28:03,916
- [David] Let me give you a hand.
- [grunts] I'm good.

316
00:28:05,375 --> 00:28:06,958
- You okay?
- [David] All right.

317
00:28:07,041 --> 00:28:09,333
- Is that all right?
- [grunts]

318
00:28:09,416 --> 00:28:10,791
- Good?
- Yeah.

319
00:28:10,875 --> 00:28:11,958
I'm good. Thanks.

320
00:28:12,041 --> 00:28:13,333
- [David] Yeah?
- [Michael] Yes.

321
00:28:14,708 --> 00:28:17,833
So, Michael, Hyperion talked
to your sister. She's okay.

322
00:28:18,833 --> 00:28:21,291
They're gonna be hiring her
a full-time guardian

323
00:28:21,375 --> 00:28:22,750
and covering every expense.

324
00:28:24,666 --> 00:28:25,500
Thank you.

325
00:28:27,208 --> 00:28:30,500
These are yours. The mission director
wants to give you some more details

326
00:28:30,583 --> 00:28:32,208
when we're up for live comm tomorrow,
so...

327
00:28:33,416 --> 00:28:34,833
[Michael exhales]

328
00:28:35,791 --> 00:28:36,791
Okay. Um...

329
00:28:38,458 --> 00:28:40,000
Thank you. Uh...

330
00:28:41,125 --> 00:28:44,750
I actually came down here 'cause I had
a couple things I wanted to say.

331
00:28:45,583 --> 00:28:48,916
- Uh... do you mind?
- [Barnett] No, please.

332
00:28:49,500 --> 00:28:50,333
Um...

333
00:28:51,250 --> 00:28:52,166
First off...

334
00:28:53,250 --> 00:28:56,958
I just want to apologize
for that freak-out I had back there.

335
00:28:57,041 --> 00:29:02,000
It was just kind of a shock
to... wake up here.

336
00:29:05,416 --> 00:29:06,333
Thank you.

337
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:08,083
Of course.

338
00:29:09,666 --> 00:29:11,500
Also, I'm not gonna just sit around.

339
00:29:12,833 --> 00:29:15,708
I know the ship is small
and it's a lot smaller now that I'm here.

340
00:29:15,791 --> 00:29:19,458
And I'm sure there's some grunt work
to be done. And I can learn fast.

341
00:29:20,625 --> 00:29:22,875
I can do... whatever it takes.

342
00:29:23,666 --> 00:29:25,583
Thank you, Michael. I appreciate that.

343
00:29:26,708 --> 00:29:29,708
We're waiting on Hyperion
to tell us what to do next.

344
00:29:29,791 --> 00:29:33,083
But in the meantime, if you're up to it,

345
00:29:33,166 --> 00:29:36,000
perhaps Zoe can run you
through the safety procedures.

346
00:29:36,083 --> 00:29:36,916
Yeah.

347
00:29:41,166 --> 00:29:42,041
Um...

348
00:29:43,083 --> 00:29:48,125
We're sorry you missed the fillet mignon,
but... this is the next best thing.

349
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:50,666
- We think it's spaghetti.
- [Barnett chuckles]

350
00:29:50,750 --> 00:29:54,416
I should warn you now that Zoe thinks
she's the in-flight entertainment.

351
00:29:54,500 --> 00:29:55,875
[Michael chuckles] Understood.

352
00:29:57,000 --> 00:29:58,250
You're David Kim, right?

353
00:29:58,958 --> 00:30:01,250
- Uh, just David's fine.
- [Michael] Got it.

354
00:30:01,833 --> 00:30:03,208
[David] So you're in school?

355
00:30:03,291 --> 00:30:06,416
Yeah. Working on my master's
in structural engineering.

356
00:30:07,041 --> 00:30:08,916
[Zoe] Were you working on a proposal
for HARP?

357
00:30:09,000 --> 00:30:11,583
I actually plan on putting
something together for the next mission.

358
00:30:13,833 --> 00:30:15,791
I'm not sure you need to apply anymore.

359
00:30:17,875 --> 00:30:20,291
[chuckles] Yeah. I guess not.

360
00:30:20,875 --> 00:30:22,208
[Michael & David chuckle]

361
00:30:22,291 --> 00:30:25,708
Um... cheers. Welcome to <i>MTS-42.</i>

362
00:30:25,791 --> 00:30:27,166
- [David] Cheers.
- Cheers.

363
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:29,375
- [Barnett] Cheers.
- [David] Cheers.

364
00:30:36,916 --> 00:30:39,750
[Zoe] I don't know. It really doesn't feel
like he's here on purpose.

365
00:30:39,833 --> 00:30:42,083
[David] Agreed. So, what do we do?

366
00:30:43,583 --> 00:30:45,541
I mean, I think he should keep busy.
I just don't...

367
00:30:46,708 --> 00:30:48,208
I don't think I have anything for him.

368
00:30:51,541 --> 00:30:55,250
Well, maybe I could have him do
some data entry for me.

369
00:30:56,541 --> 00:30:58,250
It'd actually be nice
to have some company.

370
00:31:00,208 --> 00:31:01,416
[Zoe] Yeah, that works.

371
00:31:04,291 --> 00:31:06,291
[chuckles]

372
00:31:08,083 --> 00:31:09,958
- [David] What?
- Uh...

373
00:31:11,083 --> 00:31:13,958
You're gonna have to share credit
on whatever you publish.

374
00:31:15,375 --> 00:31:17,666
- It's not about the credit, Zo.
- Okay.

375
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:20,833
Well, you're a better person than I am,
David Kim.

376
00:31:20,916 --> 00:31:22,833
- [David] That's for sure.
- [chuckles]

377
00:31:24,500 --> 00:31:26,833
- Okay. That's a plan, then?
- It's a plan.

378
00:31:26,916 --> 00:31:28,583
- All right. Oh, yeah.
- Yeah.

379
00:31:32,916 --> 00:31:34,625
Try not to snore too loud tonight.

380
00:31:35,833 --> 00:31:38,291
For the night, when lights are dimmed,
they have to stay dimmed.

381
00:31:38,375 --> 00:31:40,083
- It's a power-consumption thing.
- All right.

382
00:31:40,166 --> 00:31:43,000
And if there's a catastrophic failure
in a single module,

383
00:31:43,083 --> 00:31:45,291
like fire or rapid depressurization...
Watch your head.

384
00:31:46,041 --> 00:31:47,291
...you have to close this hatch.

385
00:31:47,375 --> 00:31:48,458
So bye-bye, David.

386
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:52,541
This is the magnetic radiation-proofing.

387
00:31:53,041 --> 00:31:55,208
In case there's a solar storm,
come in here.

388
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,916
I realize your first visit
was a little intense,

389
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:01,625
but this happens to be my favorite spot
on the ship.

390
00:32:05,291 --> 00:32:07,291
[tranquil music playing]

391
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:18,875
Wow.

392
00:32:20,291 --> 00:32:21,791
Pictures don't do it justice.

393
00:32:22,541 --> 00:32:23,666
[Zoe] No. Not at all.

394
00:32:36,583 --> 00:32:38,041
What's your sister's name?

395
00:32:39,875 --> 00:32:40,708
- Ava.
- Yeah.

396
00:32:48,083 --> 00:32:49,791
And it's just the two of you?

397
00:32:51,458 --> 00:32:52,875
- Yeah.
- Mm.

398
00:33:12,625 --> 00:33:13,541
[grunts]

399
00:33:52,750 --> 00:33:55,166
[experimental jazz music playing
over speakers]

400
00:33:56,125 --> 00:33:58,791
[David] Okay, well, this is Batch 62.

401
00:33:58,875 --> 00:34:00,250
Batch 62.

402
00:34:00,333 --> 00:34:02,625
And we'll start with Row 4.

403
00:34:02,708 --> 00:34:03,541
Row 4.

404
00:34:05,791 --> 00:34:07,708
Row 4A will be...

405
00:34:10,041 --> 00:34:11,333
10.23.

406
00:34:15,625 --> 00:34:16,958
- [chuckling]
- Section B...

407
00:34:20,208 --> 00:34:22,333
[Michael laughing]

408
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:23,291
What?

409
00:34:23,958 --> 00:34:24,875
I'm sorry.

410
00:34:25,916 --> 00:34:26,833
I've gotta ask.

411
00:34:27,375 --> 00:34:28,208
Like...

412
00:34:29,208 --> 00:34:30,416
what is this?

413
00:34:30,500 --> 00:34:32,166
I mean, what are we listening to?

414
00:34:32,708 --> 00:34:35,416
- What, you don't listen to jazz at all?
- No. [chuckles]

415
00:34:35,500 --> 00:34:36,666
I mean, not really.

416
00:34:36,750 --> 00:34:40,916
Actually, my wife is the one
that got me into jazz, but now I love it.

417
00:34:41,833 --> 00:34:42,666
Hmm.

418
00:34:43,916 --> 00:34:45,958
Section B is...

419
00:34:47,541 --> 00:34:49,041
2.16.

420
00:34:49,125 --> 00:34:50,791
Two point one six.

421
00:34:50,875 --> 00:34:53,208
Yeah. Research can get
a little bit monotonous at times.

422
00:34:53,291 --> 00:34:55,000
You know, especially phycology, but...

423
00:34:55,958 --> 00:34:57,791
these guys, they keep me on my toes.

424
00:34:58,416 --> 00:35:01,291
You know, Sanders, Coltrane, Bird.

425
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,916
Ah. They're like basketball players or...

426
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:07,208
Yeah, they're basketball players.
No, they're not.

427
00:35:07,291 --> 00:35:09,458
These guys are jazz legends of the '60s.

428
00:35:09,541 --> 00:35:11,458
Right, I knew that. I just... That's...

429
00:35:12,666 --> 00:35:16,500
There. You hear how it's unpredictable?
But it still has rules.

430
00:35:16,583 --> 00:35:17,958
They're generally playing together,

431
00:35:18,041 --> 00:35:20,333
but once in a while,
a player or two will drift off

432
00:35:20,416 --> 00:35:21,541
into their own little groove.

433
00:35:24,250 --> 00:35:25,208
There. You hear it?

434
00:35:29,083 --> 00:35:30,958
- No. I don't.
- [laughs]

435
00:35:31,041 --> 00:35:33,208
- Okay.
- It's like it sounds like a hot mess.

436
00:35:33,291 --> 00:35:36,083
Oh, well, that's what I like about it.
It's not obvious.

437
00:35:38,166 --> 00:35:41,083
And, I mean, sometimes it can be
a little bit unpleasant.

438
00:35:42,625 --> 00:35:44,541
- But it's pure expression.
- Hmm.

439
00:35:45,583 --> 00:35:48,875
- And it usually finds a balance.
- Nice. I can dig that.

440
00:35:51,625 --> 00:35:52,458
Okay.

441
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:56,708
Section C, 9.86.

442
00:36:01,541 --> 00:36:03,541
[oxygen pumping]

443
00:36:26,583 --> 00:36:28,583
[tense music playing]

444
00:36:33,375 --> 00:36:35,125
[Barnett over comm]
<i>How's it looking in there?</i>

445
00:36:35,208 --> 00:36:37,000
The whole left side came loose.

446
00:36:39,208 --> 00:36:41,458
- Okay, remove the cover.
<i>- Roger.</i>

447
00:36:48,500 --> 00:36:49,541
[air hisses]

448
00:36:50,625 --> 00:36:51,500
Carefully.

449
00:36:51,583 --> 00:36:52,500
Copy.

450
00:36:58,333 --> 00:36:59,333
Oh, shit.

451
00:37:00,000 --> 00:37:02,208
<i>- What?</i>
- There must have been a short.

452
00:37:03,875 --> 00:37:04,958
<i>On the desiccant bed?</i>

453
00:37:06,666 --> 00:37:07,500
Yeah.

454
00:37:08,791 --> 00:37:09,916
The whole thing is charred.

455
00:37:11,250 --> 00:37:12,333
Take another picture.

456
00:37:31,208 --> 00:37:32,708
[sighs]

457
00:37:36,250 --> 00:37:37,083
Are we all set?

458
00:37:41,833 --> 00:37:43,458
{\an8}Hyperion, this is <i>MTS. </i>Come in.

459
00:37:48,916 --> 00:37:50,625
[Jim speaking indistinctly over earpiece]

460
00:37:50,708 --> 00:37:52,916
Yes. We have
a damaged life-support assembly.

461
00:37:53,000 --> 00:37:55,750
I need you to inspect
the incoming images of the CDRA.

462
00:37:56,583 --> 00:37:58,583
[Jim speaking indistinctly]

463
00:37:59,541 --> 00:38:02,416
It's critical that this gets fixed, Jim.
Mission critical.

464
00:38:02,500 --> 00:38:04,500
[Jim speaking indistinctly]

465
00:38:04,583 --> 00:38:06,041
Yeah. Going off comm.

466
00:38:23,458 --> 00:38:25,583
- [Michael chuckling]
- David, can I speak to you?

467
00:38:25,666 --> 00:38:27,791
- Of course.
- Michael, can you put on David's suit?

468
00:38:27,875 --> 00:38:29,500
Zoe will explain what she needs you to do.

469
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:30,750
Yeah, sure. Of course.

470
00:38:32,041 --> 00:38:34,041
[tense music playing]

471
00:39:03,541 --> 00:39:05,541
- Yes, commander?
- Uh...

472
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:09,750
How much O2 does your rack produce?

473
00:39:10,750 --> 00:39:13,916
I mean, 90 liters a day.
Just a negligible amount.

474
00:39:14,916 --> 00:39:17,041
Is there any way you can get it up to 950?

475
00:39:17,125 --> 00:39:18,375
- Nine fifty?
- Yeah.

476
00:39:18,458 --> 00:39:20,625
No. Not with microgreens.

477
00:39:20,708 --> 00:39:22,791
We're testing food production here,
not scrubbing CO2.

478
00:39:22,875 --> 00:39:24,625
I thought that's what your research
was about.

479
00:39:24,708 --> 00:39:28,250
Yeah, but that's with algae,
and that can only be opened on Mars.

480
00:39:28,333 --> 00:39:30,666
Well, how much oxygen
would your algae produce?

481
00:39:31,791 --> 00:39:33,000
Um...

482
00:39:33,500 --> 00:39:34,708
approximately...

483
00:39:36,541 --> 00:39:38,291
I could come close
to what you're looking for

484
00:39:38,375 --> 00:39:40,833
under the right conditions,
but all the gear I'd need

485
00:39:40,916 --> 00:39:43,250
was already flown to Mars
on the last unmanned.

486
00:39:45,625 --> 00:39:47,166
What are we up against here?

487
00:39:48,375 --> 00:39:49,583
Did we lose the CDRA?

488
00:39:51,291 --> 00:39:52,708
We don't know for sure yet.

489
00:39:54,250 --> 00:39:59,125
Uh... okay.
Um... what about the backup canisters?

490
00:39:59,916 --> 00:40:01,000
We don't have enough.

491
00:40:03,458 --> 00:40:06,166
Shit, is there anything?
Anything else you can try?

492
00:40:06,250 --> 00:40:07,916
I could try growing them here,

493
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:11,500
but we would risk
ruining the entire culture.

494
00:40:13,458 --> 00:40:14,416
All right. Uh...

495
00:40:16,208 --> 00:40:20,375
Okay, if I use half of the algae,
it could probably still leave me enough

496
00:40:20,458 --> 00:40:21,625
for a starter culture on Mars.

497
00:40:21,708 --> 00:40:24,708
Okay, good. Just put everything else aside
and focus on that.

498
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:26,333
Yes, commander. Uh...

499
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:28,916
I need a little bit
to figure everything out.

500
00:40:29,000 --> 00:40:29,833
Okay, copy.

501
00:40:32,625 --> 00:40:33,541
Oh, and, David?

502
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:38,000
Zoe and Michael are removing the CDRA.
They don't need to know this yet.

503
00:40:38,666 --> 00:40:39,583
[David] Mm-hm.

504
00:40:45,250 --> 00:40:47,791
- Comm check.
- Yeah. I can hear you.

505
00:40:47,875 --> 00:40:50,416
No. When I say "comm check,"
say "good check."

506
00:40:51,666 --> 00:40:52,500
[Michael] Okay.

507
00:40:53,375 --> 00:40:54,625
- Comm check?
- Good check.

508
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:58,291
[Zoe] I'm gonna depressurize
the antechamber.

509
00:41:01,958 --> 00:41:03,125
[Michael clears throat]

510
00:41:04,125 --> 00:41:06,250
When we get in there, everything's normal.

511
00:41:06,333 --> 00:41:10,000
There's gonna be no air, but everything's
gonna be normal other than that.

512
00:41:10,083 --> 00:41:11,458
No floating around, just...

513
00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:13,083
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I'm good.

514
00:41:13,166 --> 00:41:14,750
- You're just reading instructions.
- Right.

515
00:41:21,291 --> 00:41:23,291
[tense music playing]

516
00:41:45,125 --> 00:41:47,083
- [Zoe] What's first?
- Um...

517
00:41:47,166 --> 00:41:50,541
Got to, uh, unscrew the absorbent bed.

518
00:41:50,625 --> 00:41:52,458
It's those screws on the other side.

519
00:42:10,291 --> 00:42:12,708
[drill whirring]

520
00:42:24,208 --> 00:42:25,750
[Michael] So, what does this thing do?

521
00:42:26,708 --> 00:42:28,875
It scrubs the carbon dioxide
out of the air.

522
00:42:29,500 --> 00:42:30,333
You take that.

523
00:42:44,458 --> 00:42:46,000
- [Zoe] <i>Ready?</i>
- [Michael] <i>Yeah, I'm ready.</i>

524
00:42:46,083 --> 00:42:47,958
[Zoe grunts] Here we go.

525
00:42:50,541 --> 00:42:51,625
Careful with that.

526
00:42:51,708 --> 00:42:52,708
Very, very careful.

527
00:42:53,625 --> 00:42:55,333
- Okay.
- Whew.

528
00:43:00,291 --> 00:43:02,291
[Zoe panting]

529
00:43:05,875 --> 00:43:10,458
[sighs] I will never get used to how
little material is between us and space.

530
00:43:11,250 --> 00:43:12,458
[Michael] That I know.

531
00:43:13,083 --> 00:43:15,375
When they started adding
a third passenger,

532
00:43:15,458 --> 00:43:18,541
to make up for the weight, they made
the functional module almost half the size

533
00:43:18,625 --> 00:43:20,791
and removed a protective layer
of shielding.

534
00:43:22,041 --> 00:43:23,291
Hey, that's not helpful.

535
00:43:24,166 --> 00:43:25,833
- Just facts.
- Not a helpful thing to say.

536
00:43:25,916 --> 00:43:27,333
It's just facts. [chuckles]

537
00:43:31,041 --> 00:43:32,708
- [Zoe] Oh, I'll take that.
- Yeah.

538
00:43:34,083 --> 00:43:35,666
- [Barnett] You guys okay?
- [both] Yeah.

539
00:43:40,416 --> 00:43:41,250
Okay.

540
00:43:45,458 --> 00:43:46,625
- Michael?
- Mm-hm?

541
00:43:48,166 --> 00:43:49,041
Oh.

542
00:43:50,500 --> 00:43:51,791
[Zoe] Ah, shit.

543
00:43:58,625 --> 00:43:59,833
- You got it?
- Mm-hm.

544
00:44:02,083 --> 00:44:03,375
[Zoe] Yeah, that's great.

545
00:44:09,166 --> 00:44:12,125
Okay, a little pinch here.

546
00:44:12,208 --> 00:44:14,208
[Michael breathing deeply]

547
00:44:18,375 --> 00:44:19,416
Thanks.

548
00:44:19,500 --> 00:44:21,041
I mean, it's literally my job.

549
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:24,041
Not just for this.
You've just kind of gone out of your way

550
00:44:24,125 --> 00:44:26,250
- to make me feel welcome, so...
- Of course.

551
00:44:27,791 --> 00:44:31,375
Okay. Um... can you take this off?

552
00:44:32,958 --> 00:44:33,958
- My shirt?
- Yeah.

553
00:44:46,666 --> 00:44:48,250
- Can you put your arm up?
- Yeah.

554
00:44:48,333 --> 00:44:49,166
Thank you.

555
00:44:52,083 --> 00:44:52,916
Okay.

556
00:45:03,583 --> 00:45:04,791
[winces]

557
00:45:23,041 --> 00:45:26,500
- [Barnett] How's it coming?
- We're still wrapping up, but I'm worried.

558
00:45:27,375 --> 00:45:31,625
I'm worried we're only gonna be able
to get to 500, maybe 550 liters a day.

559
00:45:31,708 --> 00:45:34,416
Oh, no. That's good.
That's literally half of what we need.

560
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,375
So let's go ahead
and thaw out the second batch of algae.

561
00:45:37,458 --> 00:45:39,625
No. I'd need to rip up the microgreens
for that.

562
00:45:39,708 --> 00:45:41,708
- Then let's do it.
- Wait a minute, hold on, hold on.

563
00:45:42,708 --> 00:45:44,458
The algae is far from thriving.

564
00:45:45,375 --> 00:45:49,333
It's scrubbing only a fraction of what
I could get if I had the right equipment.

565
00:45:49,416 --> 00:45:53,583
Using the second half of the batch doesn't
necessarily mean it'll double the output.

566
00:45:55,625 --> 00:45:57,083
It's imperative that we try.

567
00:45:57,166 --> 00:45:59,958
Commander,
this can't be something we rely on.

568
00:46:00,458 --> 00:46:02,083
These batches can die at any moment,

569
00:46:02,166 --> 00:46:04,375
and I could lose everything
I need for Mars.

570
00:46:11,083 --> 00:46:11,916
Commander...

571
00:46:13,083 --> 00:46:14,875
this research is years of my life.

572
00:46:14,958 --> 00:46:16,666
We both know how important it is.

573
00:46:18,125 --> 00:46:20,333
Are we sure we want to throw it all away

574
00:46:20,416 --> 00:46:22,708
while we still have a chance
to fix the CDRA?

575
00:46:26,458 --> 00:46:27,291
Um...

576
00:46:32,041 --> 00:46:33,750
There is no chance, David.

577
00:46:36,458 --> 00:46:37,291
It's gone.

578
00:46:37,375 --> 00:46:39,375
[tense music playing]

579
00:46:42,375 --> 00:46:43,208
Understood.

580
00:47:09,875 --> 00:47:10,916
[sighs]

581
00:48:01,375 --> 00:48:06,416
Ava. Hey. I hope you're treating
the people at Hyperion really nicely,

582
00:48:06,500 --> 00:48:10,666
'cause I heard that they are moving
you closer to school, which is nice.

583
00:48:12,041 --> 00:48:12,875
Really nice.

584
00:48:12,958 --> 00:48:15,625
Make sure you send me some selfies
when you can, okay?

585
00:48:18,208 --> 00:48:19,958
I'm really getting my groove here.

586
00:48:20,875 --> 00:48:22,875
<i>I thought at first
I was probably gonna be a burden</i>

587
00:48:22,958 --> 00:48:26,041
<i>to, you know, the crew and everyone here,</i>

588
00:48:26,125 --> 00:48:28,666
<i>but they're actually putting me to work.</i>

589
00:48:28,750 --> 00:48:30,458
[tense music playing]

590
00:48:30,541 --> 00:48:32,666
<i>I hate that it happened this way.</i>

591
00:48:33,208 --> 00:48:36,166
<i>But I'm thinking
that this might actually turn out</i>

592
00:48:36,916 --> 00:48:40,916
<i>to be best for me
and for us in the long run.</i>

593
00:49:07,333 --> 00:49:10,791
[Barnett] Correct. Unfortunately,
none of the second batch survived.

594
00:49:12,833 --> 00:49:15,041
[Jim speaking indistinctly over earpiece]

595
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:18,833
That was my fear.

596
00:49:20,083 --> 00:49:22,083
[Jim speaking indistinctly]

597
00:49:24,875 --> 00:49:25,708
You sure?

598
00:49:29,208 --> 00:49:31,208
[Jim speaking indistinctly]

599
00:49:36,791 --> 00:49:39,000
And why is the climb up
not an option again?

600
00:49:39,083 --> 00:49:41,083
[Jim speaking indistinctly]

601
00:49:51,500 --> 00:49:53,458
Okay, you've got to level with me, Jim.

602
00:49:56,750 --> 00:49:57,583
Is there...?

603
00:49:59,375 --> 00:50:02,333
[in breaking voice]
Is there any way I can take his place?

604
00:50:02,875 --> 00:50:05,833
Because Hyperion can orbit the capsule
around Mars

605
00:50:05,916 --> 00:50:08,750
and send up a pilot from the colony.
But I... How can I...?

606
00:50:10,041 --> 00:50:11,375
How do you expect me to...?

607
00:50:14,625 --> 00:50:16,625
[Jim speaking indistinctly]

608
00:50:21,875 --> 00:50:23,500
[sniffles] Yeah. Okay, well, I...

609
00:50:23,583 --> 00:50:25,583
[Jim speaking indistinctly]

610
00:50:29,166 --> 00:50:31,416
I need you to walk me
through every option.

611
00:50:31,500 --> 00:50:33,208
Every single possibility.

612
00:50:34,375 --> 00:50:36,375
[Jim speaking indistinctly]

613
00:50:46,458 --> 00:50:49,541
Uh... I, uh...

614
00:50:51,791 --> 00:50:52,708
I, um...

615
00:50:57,625 --> 00:50:59,583
There's no easy way to say this. Um...

616
00:51:01,291 --> 00:51:04,500
The carbon-dioxide scrubber
is damaged permanently.

617
00:51:05,916 --> 00:51:09,875
The lithium-hydroxide canisters were only
ever meant to be a temporary solution.

618
00:51:12,458 --> 00:51:14,958
We only have enough oxygen on board
for two people.

619
00:51:19,375 --> 00:51:21,958
I've asked David
to accelerate his research.

620
00:51:22,041 --> 00:51:25,041
He's managed to get his algae
to produce enough for one more.

621
00:51:26,291 --> 00:51:27,958
So... Um...

622
00:51:31,291 --> 00:51:32,291
What are you saying?

623
00:51:35,750 --> 00:51:38,083
We can't make it to Mars
with Michael on board.

624
00:51:39,625 --> 00:51:42,250
We'll end up asphyxiating
on carbon dioxide

625
00:51:42,333 --> 00:51:43,708
a few weeks before we land.

626
00:51:44,666 --> 00:51:45,500
I mean...

627
00:51:47,041 --> 00:51:50,500
[scoffs] this ship.
Yeah, it was overbuilt for two.

628
00:51:50,583 --> 00:51:52,916
And Hyperion started to take a chance
pushing it to three,

629
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:54,166
but it just can't handle four.

630
00:51:57,166 --> 00:51:59,500
[David] Okay.
I've been thinking about this.

631
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:02,166
And all we gotta do
is get to the colony on Mars, right?

632
00:52:02,875 --> 00:52:04,416
Then CO2 isn't the issue.

633
00:52:04,500 --> 00:52:07,541
We could just vent it out
and lower the atmospheric pressure.

634
00:52:08,916 --> 00:52:10,833
What we need is oxygen. I don't know,

635
00:52:10,916 --> 00:52:14,583
we could use the pre-breathing
oxygen cylinders. Or water.

636
00:52:14,666 --> 00:52:16,750
We could just split oxygen out of that.

637
00:52:17,625 --> 00:52:20,500
We don't have enough.
That would buy him days, not months.

638
00:52:21,541 --> 00:52:24,958
Um, maybe a resupply mission?
If it was unmanned?

639
00:52:25,916 --> 00:52:27,916
We're moving too fast for a resupply.

640
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,416
The Kingfisher's
the biggest rocket they can build.

641
00:52:31,500 --> 00:52:34,958
Okay, but there's a giant tank up there
that was full of liquid oxygen

642
00:52:35,041 --> 00:52:37,125
for the launch.
There must be something left.

643
00:52:37,208 --> 00:52:38,708
Well, there's no way to tell from here.

644
00:52:38,791 --> 00:52:41,291
We can't just reel in the tethers
with the Kingfisher attached.

645
00:52:41,375 --> 00:52:43,416
Okay, so we climb up and check.

646
00:52:43,500 --> 00:52:45,083
Climb the tether? All the way?

647
00:52:45,166 --> 00:52:47,041
- That's 450 meters.
- It wouldn't be full...

648
00:52:47,125 --> 00:52:49,083
Look, Michael was on board
when we launched,

649
00:52:49,166 --> 00:52:51,375
so he used up extra oxygen and fuel.

650
00:52:51,875 --> 00:52:53,625
Okay? We barely had enough
to make it to here.

651
00:52:55,041 --> 00:52:58,208
Climbing up would mean
risking damaging the solar panels,

652
00:52:58,291 --> 00:53:00,541
severing the power cables,
even falling off the ship.

653
00:53:00,625 --> 00:53:01,916
Hyperion looked into it.

654
00:53:02,583 --> 00:53:04,708
It's just I can't risk both of your lives

655
00:53:04,791 --> 00:53:07,166
for the possibility
that you could save him.

656
00:53:07,666 --> 00:53:08,916
[sighs]

657
00:53:10,625 --> 00:53:12,583
There must be something we can do.
Anything.

658
00:53:12,666 --> 00:53:15,000
Guys, this is not a call for a solution.

659
00:53:16,083 --> 00:53:18,583
The entirety of Hyperion is down there
trying to figure this out.

660
00:53:18,666 --> 00:53:21,083
I'm only telling you because I need you
to be mentally prepared

661
00:53:21,166 --> 00:53:22,375
for what's gonna happen.

662
00:53:28,750 --> 00:53:30,583
So how much time does he have left?

663
00:53:32,333 --> 00:53:33,416
Uh...

664
00:53:34,958 --> 00:53:36,541
I'll talk to him today. I'll...

665
00:53:38,166 --> 00:53:40,083
- give him a few days.
- No, um, hold on.

666
00:53:41,416 --> 00:53:43,791
You're gonna talk to him today? What...?

667
00:53:43,875 --> 00:53:46,166
What are we gonna do,
ask him to walk out of the airlock?

668
00:53:46,875 --> 00:53:48,666
I mean, okay.

669
00:53:49,541 --> 00:53:52,583
Exactly how much time do we have
before it's too late?

670
00:53:54,083 --> 00:53:56,083
Technically, 20 days.

671
00:53:56,166 --> 00:53:58,250
Okay. Then we should take that time.

672
00:53:58,333 --> 00:54:00,541
No, we need as much
of that margin of error as possible

673
00:54:00,625 --> 00:54:02,708
- in case anything else happens.
- [Zoe] Margin of error?

674
00:54:02,791 --> 00:54:05,916
What hypothetical situation could be worse
than the one we're in right now?

675
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:09,375
Worst-case scenario is he still dies,
but we die along with him.

676
00:54:09,458 --> 00:54:10,958
- How?
- What's left of the algae

677
00:54:11,041 --> 00:54:13,041
is hanging on by a thread as it is.

678
00:54:13,125 --> 00:54:15,750
So you're fine just giving up on a person
because the risk...?

679
00:54:15,833 --> 00:54:18,083
Zoe, realistically,
every day he's still here,

680
00:54:18,166 --> 00:54:19,875
it's a danger to all of us.

681
00:54:19,958 --> 00:54:23,625
I am telling you,
Hyperion has anyone with a PhD down there

682
00:54:23,708 --> 00:54:25,916
- trying to work this out.
- And they're not here!

683
00:54:26,000 --> 00:54:28,208
And maybe we can think
of something that they haven't!

684
00:54:28,291 --> 00:54:29,333
They built the ship.

685
00:54:30,166 --> 00:54:33,125
They have one-to-one replicas of the <i>MTS.</i>
They know every inch of this place.

686
00:54:33,208 --> 00:54:36,416
- They didn't know Michael was in here.
- Come on, Zoe. That's not the same thing.

687
00:54:37,291 --> 00:54:39,416
Twenty days? Commander, I mean...

688
00:54:41,041 --> 00:54:43,083
if there's really nothing we can do,

689
00:54:44,250 --> 00:54:46,625
we have to take someone's life.

690
00:54:53,791 --> 00:54:58,125
Is it unreasonable to just take that time
and make sure we've gone over everything?

691
00:55:07,083 --> 00:55:08,250
Ten days. That's it.

692
00:55:09,125 --> 00:55:11,416
- Commander, with all...
- [Barnett] No. We can spare ten days.

693
00:55:11,500 --> 00:55:13,250
[Zoe] Okay. Okay.

694
00:55:13,333 --> 00:55:15,750
Um, and what do we tell Michael
in the meantime?

695
00:55:16,458 --> 00:55:18,291
Look, we were chosen to be here.

696
00:55:19,583 --> 00:55:21,750
We've been trained psychologically
and otherwise.

697
00:55:21,833 --> 00:55:22,875
He hasn't.

698
00:55:22,958 --> 00:55:25,833
He can't contribute to any of this
in any meaningful way,

699
00:55:25,916 --> 00:55:28,625
so I think the best course of action
is to just keep this between us.

700
00:55:29,583 --> 00:55:30,958
- Understood?
- [Zoe] Yes, commander.

701
00:55:32,083 --> 00:55:32,916
David?

702
00:55:35,166 --> 00:55:36,000
Yes.

703
00:55:37,625 --> 00:55:38,458
Understood.

704
00:55:52,833 --> 00:55:53,875
[sighs]

705
00:55:56,750 --> 00:55:58,375
[packet slides]

706
00:56:09,208 --> 00:56:13,791
So how is your new assignment coming?

707
00:56:18,083 --> 00:56:18,916
It's fine.

708
00:56:25,708 --> 00:56:26,541
Okay.

709
00:56:29,500 --> 00:56:33,833
Jim? For their sanity,
they need to try this.

710
00:56:33,916 --> 00:56:36,125
[Jim speaking indistinctly over earpiece]

711
00:56:37,166 --> 00:56:39,541
What are you talking about?
The mission is shot!

712
00:56:40,750 --> 00:56:41,583
We have a...

713
00:56:41,666 --> 00:56:43,833
[Jim speaking indistinctly]

714
00:56:43,916 --> 00:56:47,125
We have a five-month trip there,
plus the trip back.

715
00:56:47,208 --> 00:56:49,958
I still need this crew
to be able to perform critical tasks.

716
00:56:50,041 --> 00:56:51,125
[Jim speaking indistinctly]

717
00:56:51,208 --> 00:56:54,000
No, they cannot do that
if they are devastated by guilt.

718
00:56:54,083 --> 00:56:56,083
[Jim speaking indistinctly]

719
00:57:01,291 --> 00:57:03,291
Well, I'm taking the ten days.

720
00:57:03,958 --> 00:57:05,958
[tense music playing]

721
00:57:36,208 --> 00:57:38,208
[David] Commander, it's been three days.

722
00:57:38,958 --> 00:57:41,375
Is Hyperion still trying
to figure something out?

723
00:57:43,083 --> 00:57:43,916
Yep.

724
00:57:51,791 --> 00:57:52,625
Go ahead.

725
00:57:58,791 --> 00:58:03,166
Wouldn't they already know
if there were some way to save him?

726
00:58:06,541 --> 00:58:10,458
I know how you feel,
but it's not the directive at the moment.

727
00:58:17,375 --> 00:58:18,791
We're endangering ourselves.

728
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
The longer we take, the harder it'll be
when we're forced to take the final step.

729
00:58:37,416 --> 00:58:38,875
[glove squeaks]

730
00:58:41,500 --> 00:58:42,833
- Put your arm up.
- Sure.

731
00:59:09,666 --> 00:59:11,333
[sighs]

732
00:59:15,416 --> 00:59:16,791
I was in an apartment fire.

733
00:59:20,291 --> 00:59:21,333
I was, um...

734
00:59:23,416 --> 00:59:24,541
I was 9 years old.

735
00:59:25,083 --> 00:59:27,708
[melancholy music playing]

736
00:59:27,791 --> 00:59:30,041
I guess it had happened
in the place below us.

737
00:59:30,750 --> 00:59:32,458
And I was sharing a room with Ava.

738
00:59:32,958 --> 00:59:34,041
She was...

739
00:59:35,625 --> 00:59:36,583
just a baby.

740
00:59:41,291 --> 00:59:42,666
It got pretty bad in there.

741
00:59:44,708 --> 00:59:46,458
Just before our dad managed to...

742
00:59:47,416 --> 00:59:48,500
get us out.

743
00:59:51,583 --> 00:59:52,416
That's brave.

744
00:59:53,333 --> 00:59:54,166
Mm-hm.

745
00:59:55,875 --> 00:59:56,708
Yeah.

746
00:59:58,625 --> 00:59:59,708
Then, um...

747
01:00:01,666 --> 01:00:02,625
he didn't make it?

748
01:00:04,958 --> 01:00:05,916
Nah.

749
01:00:08,333 --> 01:00:13,083
Ava and I,
we bounced around a lot after that.

750
01:00:14,666 --> 01:00:16,833
Yeah. But we always stuck together.

751
01:00:16,916 --> 01:00:19,458
She gave me this bracelet.

752
01:00:20,041 --> 01:00:20,875
Sweet.

753
01:00:21,750 --> 01:00:23,375
Yeah. That's me.

754
01:00:24,291 --> 01:00:25,333
And that's her.

755
01:00:25,416 --> 01:00:26,666
- [chuckles]
- That's cute.

756
01:00:28,416 --> 01:00:30,750
You know I actually became
her legal guardian?

757
01:00:33,416 --> 01:00:38,083
That's why it's like so hard

758
01:00:38,833 --> 01:00:40,416
for me to not be there for her.

759
01:00:51,125 --> 01:00:53,125
[sobbing]

760
01:01:27,000 --> 01:01:29,000
[tense music playing]

761
01:02:45,208 --> 01:02:46,041
Can you talk?

762
01:02:46,541 --> 01:02:47,375
[Michael] Hey.

763
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:49,333
Yeah, sure, man.

764
01:02:55,000 --> 01:02:57,166
I have something very difficult
to tell you.

765
01:02:58,041 --> 01:02:59,041
Okay.

766
01:03:00,666 --> 01:03:02,875
The CDRA is destroyed beyond repair.

767
01:03:05,250 --> 01:03:07,000
And even with every safety measure
we have,

768
01:03:07,083 --> 01:03:09,791
there is no way for all of us to survive.

769
01:03:13,166 --> 01:03:14,750
We've known for three days now.

770
01:03:16,583 --> 01:03:19,750
Hyperion has had people working around
the clock on the problem since then.

771
01:03:22,583 --> 01:03:24,791
Zoe, the commander and I...

772
01:03:26,916 --> 01:03:29,416
we tried everything we could
to figure out a way.

773
01:03:32,250 --> 01:03:33,333
But mathematically...

774
01:03:36,583 --> 01:03:37,500
with you here...

775
01:03:38,583 --> 01:03:41,791
everyone on board would suffocate
before we ever made it to Mars.

776
01:03:46,333 --> 01:03:50,166
Every day you're with us
presents a danger to the crew...

777
01:03:51,916 --> 01:03:53,250
and to the entire mission.

778
01:03:56,875 --> 01:03:58,625
Look, I have to be honest, I, uh...

779
01:04:01,333 --> 01:04:03,916
I was explicitly forbidden
to tell you any of this.

780
01:04:06,958 --> 01:04:07,791
Why?

781
01:04:09,916 --> 01:04:15,333
Zoe convinced Barnett to exhaust
our safety margins to try and save you.

782
01:04:18,250 --> 01:04:19,875
To try and figure something out.

783
01:04:22,791 --> 01:04:24,750
Isn't there anything we can figure out?

784
01:04:28,875 --> 01:04:29,708
- Is there?
- No.

785
01:04:35,250 --> 01:04:37,166
Hyperion would already know by now.

786
01:04:37,250 --> 01:04:39,250
[somber music playing]

787
01:04:47,250 --> 01:04:48,416
This would be painless.

788
01:04:54,791 --> 01:04:56,916
And you would just fall asleep.

789
01:05:05,958 --> 01:05:06,958
I'm sorry, Michael.

790
01:05:27,750 --> 01:05:29,125
[sobbing]

791
01:05:36,875 --> 01:05:38,541
[sighs, then grunts]

792
01:06:24,666 --> 01:06:25,791
[grunts]

793
01:06:35,541 --> 01:06:36,375
Hey, Ava.

794
01:06:41,083 --> 01:06:44,166
I know this transition
hasn't been the easiest for you.

795
01:06:45,375 --> 01:06:46,416
[sighs]

796
01:06:46,500 --> 01:06:48,583
And as hard as it is for me to know that,

797
01:06:48,666 --> 01:06:49,750
I gotta face the fact

798
01:06:49,833 --> 01:06:53,083
that I'm not gonna be there
with you every step of the way.

799
01:06:56,000 --> 01:06:56,958
But you're tough.

800
01:06:58,333 --> 01:06:59,875
Tougher than I'll ever be.

801
01:07:03,833 --> 01:07:06,333
<i>You know, I met
some really incredible people here.</i>

802
01:07:07,041 --> 01:07:08,250
<i>I mean, they're smart...</i>

803
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:09,875
<i>caring...</i>

804
01:07:11,208 --> 01:07:12,041
<i>driven.</i>

805
01:07:13,041 --> 01:07:16,500
<i>They're the best at what they do.
And I see so much of you in them.</i>

806
01:07:24,583 --> 01:07:26,250
I gotta go, but, um...

807
01:07:27,166 --> 01:07:28,166
[sniffles]

808
01:07:28,958 --> 01:07:29,791
...I love you.

809
01:07:43,875 --> 01:07:44,708
[Zoe] Michael?

810
01:07:46,583 --> 01:07:47,416
Are you okay?

811
01:08:05,625 --> 01:08:06,458
Michael?

812
01:08:21,375 --> 01:08:22,708
You don't have to do this.

813
01:08:25,666 --> 01:08:27,041
There's nothing else to do.

814
01:08:28,166 --> 01:08:29,125
We don't know that.

815
01:08:34,166 --> 01:08:36,041
Look, I know you fought for me, okay?

816
01:08:37,958 --> 01:08:39,875
But this is different.

817
01:08:42,625 --> 01:08:43,458
This is...

818
01:08:46,500 --> 01:08:47,750
It's hopeless, you know?

819
01:08:51,166 --> 01:08:52,000
It isn't.

820
01:09:09,625 --> 01:09:10,708
Can I tell you something?

821
01:09:12,208 --> 01:09:15,083
This happened like 12 years ago.

822
01:09:15,583 --> 01:09:16,916
I had this summer job.

823
01:09:17,833 --> 01:09:21,500
I was supposed to be just keeping an eye
on this beach.

824
01:09:21,583 --> 01:09:23,541
I wasn't a lifeguard. Just a watch.

825
01:09:24,166 --> 01:09:26,666
'Cause there were signs all over the sand
that said "No swimming."

826
01:09:26,750 --> 01:09:28,458
I mean, they said "Danger: no swimming."

827
01:09:31,625 --> 01:09:33,875
So, I just thought
I was gonna read all day.

828
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:35,916
And...

829
01:09:38,208 --> 01:09:42,416
uh, there were these drunk guys that would
always hang out by this bonfire nearby.

830
01:09:46,875 --> 01:09:48,333
And I see a guy in the water.

831
01:09:49,166 --> 01:09:50,375
And his buddies won't wake up

832
01:09:50,458 --> 01:09:53,458
and they're passed out on the sand,
and he's just...

833
01:09:55,875 --> 01:09:57,125
quietly drowning...

834
01:09:59,125 --> 01:10:00,250
by himself out there.

835
01:10:01,875 --> 01:10:04,291
And immediately I call it in,
and I don't get a response.

836
01:10:05,250 --> 01:10:06,083
And...

837
01:10:10,333 --> 01:10:11,833
I mean, the tides are strong.

838
01:10:18,583 --> 01:10:21,791
And I jump in, and when I get to him
I'm already exhausted.

839
01:10:23,416 --> 01:10:25,375
And I'm trying to keep his head
above the water.

840
01:10:25,458 --> 01:10:29,458
And I'm there for five minutes,
and I'm in longer and longer.

841
01:10:34,375 --> 01:10:35,625
Then I start to lose him.

842
01:10:37,333 --> 01:10:38,166
And...

843
01:10:39,750 --> 01:10:41,708
suddenly I feel myself being pulled up.

844
01:10:42,458 --> 01:10:46,583
And somebody's grabbed both of us
before he slipped away.

845
01:10:46,666 --> 01:10:50,458
And they just row us to the beach,
and that's it.

846
01:10:56,541 --> 01:10:58,375
How did you know someone was coming?

847
01:11:01,625 --> 01:11:02,458
I didn't.

848
01:11:08,333 --> 01:11:09,166
I didn't.

849
01:11:22,041 --> 01:11:23,041
We've got some time.

850
01:11:24,458 --> 01:11:25,500
And that's a last resort.

851
01:11:29,041 --> 01:11:30,291
I'm not giving up on you.

852
01:11:32,000 --> 01:11:33,000
[sniffles]

853
01:11:33,875 --> 01:11:35,958
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

854
01:11:40,375 --> 01:11:42,500
- Yeah.
- Okay.

855
01:12:12,083 --> 01:12:14,166
- What did you do, David?
- Zoe.

856
01:12:14,250 --> 01:12:16,750
- What the hell did you do?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. Did Michael...?

857
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,625
No, he didn't fucking kill himself, David!

858
01:12:19,541 --> 01:12:20,958
That's what you wanted, isn't it?

859
01:12:21,041 --> 01:12:22,041
- That's...
- You had no right

860
01:12:22,125 --> 01:12:24,458
to disclose anything.
And you had no right to go into my lab

861
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:26,375
and steal my medication
for something like this!

862
01:12:26,458 --> 01:12:28,875
- I was trying to protect us.
- Barnett gave us ten days!

863
01:12:28,958 --> 01:12:29,916
Yes.

864
01:12:30,000 --> 01:12:32,500
And using all that time
is putting us at risk.

865
01:12:33,416 --> 01:12:35,208
What don't you get about this, Zoe?

866
01:12:35,875 --> 01:12:38,791
We are already doing everything we can
to try and save him.

867
01:12:38,875 --> 01:12:40,083
There's nothing else.

868
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:44,625
I'm just trying to salvage what's left
of this mission, and that includes you!

869
01:12:45,125 --> 01:12:45,958
Michael...

870
01:12:47,250 --> 01:12:49,458
Michael died the moment we took off.

871
01:12:51,250 --> 01:12:54,125
You wanted to get rid of him. You weren't
even trying to figure this out.

872
01:12:54,208 --> 01:12:55,041
Not even trying?

873
01:12:55,916 --> 01:12:57,791
I destroyed all of my research!

874
01:12:58,583 --> 01:13:00,041
This! This right here!

875
01:13:00,125 --> 01:13:02,583
This is the only thing
keeping us alive right now.

876
01:13:03,291 --> 01:13:06,000
My last three years of training
are now meaningless.

877
01:13:06,500 --> 01:13:08,958
My next two years of experimentation
are gone!

878
01:13:10,041 --> 01:13:12,708
You of all people should know
how much this work means to me.

879
01:13:12,791 --> 01:13:15,000
And I gave it all up to try and save him!

880
01:13:16,166 --> 01:13:18,083
And what the hell have you done, Zoe?

881
01:13:19,583 --> 01:13:20,583
What have you done?

882
01:13:20,666 --> 01:13:22,666
[tense music playing]

883
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:35,000
[sighs]

884
01:13:48,916 --> 01:13:50,791
How do we know
if there's enough oxygen up there?

885
01:13:50,875 --> 01:13:53,458
[sighs] We don't.
But we're out of options.

886
01:13:59,958 --> 01:14:02,291
So, these are what we use
to climb the tethers.

887
01:14:04,125 --> 01:14:07,083
Clamp it on and get some leverage.

888
01:14:09,125 --> 01:14:10,541
You have to keep pressure...

889
01:14:12,208 --> 01:14:14,916
on the handle as you're pulling up,
otherwise it'll just slide down.

890
01:14:17,541 --> 01:14:18,541
You wanna try it?

891
01:14:18,625 --> 01:14:20,250
I know it's counterintuitive,

892
01:14:20,333 --> 01:14:22,666
but you have to lift this leg
with this arm.

893
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:24,625
Right side, then, yeah.

894
01:14:26,583 --> 01:14:29,166
Yeah. You're gonna be feeling
less and less gravity

895
01:14:29,250 --> 01:14:32,125
the closer you get to the solar panels.
So, when you climb the tethers,

896
01:14:32,208 --> 01:14:34,750
- it'll get easier the higher you go, okay?
- Okay.

897
01:14:36,583 --> 01:14:38,333
It's okay. It's okay, it's okay.
You're okay.

898
01:14:38,416 --> 01:14:40,416
Start over. Let's reset.
Let's start over. We got it.

899
01:14:40,500 --> 01:14:42,375
- I got it, I got it. I got it.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

900
01:14:42,458 --> 01:14:44,166
- [breathing heavily]
- Yeah.

901
01:14:44,250 --> 01:14:45,625
- Do you wanna just reset?
- No.

902
01:14:45,708 --> 01:14:46,541
[Zoe] Oh!

903
01:14:47,375 --> 01:14:48,208
[Michael] Fuck!

904
01:14:48,291 --> 01:14:49,833
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm good! I'm good!

905
01:14:49,916 --> 01:14:50,791
[grunts]

906
01:15:20,333 --> 01:15:21,166
Commander.

907
01:15:31,000 --> 01:15:32,958
I understand that your duty
is to protect your crew

908
01:15:34,208 --> 01:15:36,458
and the risk that you've taken
by giving Michael more time.

909
01:15:38,125 --> 01:15:38,958
But he...

910
01:15:42,625 --> 01:15:44,375
We were all put in this situation.

911
01:15:46,000 --> 01:15:48,833
We have to be willing to expend
more than just resources.

912
01:15:50,958 --> 01:15:53,250
I know that climbing the tether
puts us at risk, but...

913
01:15:54,125 --> 01:15:55,666
I think we should put ourselves at risk.

914
01:15:59,375 --> 01:16:02,166
I wouldn't be able to live with myself
if I didn't try everything I could

915
01:16:02,250 --> 01:16:03,125
to save his life.

916
01:16:03,208 --> 01:16:04,208
And, David?

917
01:16:06,708 --> 01:16:07,875
I need you to help me.

918
01:16:08,500 --> 01:16:10,791
Michael can't be the one
to climb the tether. He tried.

919
01:16:12,500 --> 01:16:14,041
- What do you mean, he...?
- Michael knows.

920
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,791
- David, I'm... I know...
- I'll do it.

921
01:16:28,666 --> 01:16:30,500
What, you'll do it? Just like that?

922
01:16:35,541 --> 01:16:37,541
[ominous music playing]

923
01:16:42,166 --> 01:16:43,791
We need enough oxygen for two.

924
01:16:48,875 --> 01:16:51,541
Once you're up there,
you'll need to tap the lox tank

925
01:16:51,625 --> 01:16:54,000
and transfer as much as you can
into the canisters.

926
01:16:54,083 --> 01:16:56,791
You're not gonna know how much is in there
until you connect the gauge.

927
01:16:57,291 --> 01:16:59,458
Each of the canisters holds enough
for one person,

928
01:16:59,541 --> 01:17:02,666
so obviously, the hope
is that there will be enough for two.

929
01:17:04,291 --> 01:17:07,291
Now, when you pierce the tank,
the connection's not gonna be perfect.

930
01:17:07,375 --> 01:17:10,916
So make sure any oxygen that's leaking out
is pointed towards the back.

931
01:17:15,125 --> 01:17:16,291
Guys? Listen.

932
01:17:18,500 --> 01:17:21,083
You two never trained
for anything with this much complexity.

933
01:17:22,958 --> 01:17:24,333
<i>So, keep your cool.</i>

934
01:17:24,416 --> 01:17:25,750
<i>Overcommunicate.</i>

935
01:17:26,500 --> 01:17:27,458
<i>And take your time.</i>

936
01:17:28,416 --> 01:17:29,250
<i>Do not rush.</i>

937
01:17:33,291 --> 01:17:34,125
Michael?

938
01:17:35,875 --> 01:17:37,583
- I want you to know that what I...
- It's okay.

939
01:17:41,750 --> 01:17:42,583
We're good.

940
01:17:48,250 --> 01:17:50,250
[air hissing]

941
01:17:52,750 --> 01:17:54,750
[suspenseful music playing]

- [Barnett over comm] <i>EV1, comm check.</i>
- [David] Good check.

943
01:19:13,666 --> 01:19:16,166
- [Barnett] <i>EV2, comm check.</i>
- [Zoe] Good check.

944
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:20,541
[Barnett] <i>Good. You're gonna be feeling</i>
<i>full gravity on the roof.</i>

945
01:19:21,333 --> 01:19:24,041
<i>A little over 200 meters
to the solar panels,</i>

946
01:19:24,125 --> 01:19:27,250
<i>but the higher you go,
the less gravity you'll feel.</i>

947
01:19:27,833 --> 01:19:28,666
[Zoe] Roger.

948
01:19:29,208 --> 01:19:31,291
[Barnett] <i>Do not touch the tether</i>
<i>with the clamps</i>

949
01:19:31,375 --> 01:19:33,625
that's carrying the power down
from the solar panels.

950
01:19:33,708 --> 01:19:34,916
[Zoe] <i>Loud and clear.</i>

951
01:19:35,000 --> 01:19:36,541
<i>Don't climb the power tethers.</i>

952
01:19:58,208 --> 01:19:59,291
[David exhales]

953
01:20:00,500 --> 01:20:02,666
Wow, the spinning
is so much worse out here.

954
01:20:03,916 --> 01:20:04,875
You gonna be okay?

955
01:20:05,541 --> 01:20:06,625
Yeah. Yeah.

956
01:20:07,958 --> 01:20:09,458
I'll just focus on the tether.

957
01:20:11,208 --> 01:20:13,208
[both grunting]

958
01:20:38,041 --> 01:20:40,041
[grunting]

959
01:20:42,416 --> 01:20:44,500
[David] Hold on, Zo. I need a break.

960
01:20:53,250 --> 01:20:54,291
[Barnett] <i>Status check?</i>

961
01:20:55,208 --> 01:20:58,500
We're good. It's starting to get easier.

962
01:20:59,583 --> 01:21:00,416
Theoretically.

963
01:21:01,250 --> 01:21:03,083
[laughs] Speak for yourself.

964
01:21:06,583 --> 01:21:08,875
Try not to use your upper body
so much, okay?

965
01:21:10,166 --> 01:21:12,500
[panting] Okay.

966
01:22:08,125 --> 01:22:10,875
[Zoe] MTS.
<i>We've reached the halfway point.</i>

967
01:22:11,583 --> 01:22:13,958
Copy, EV2. You're coming into view now.

968
01:22:22,166 --> 01:22:23,916
[Barnett] <i>So just take your time.</i>

969
01:22:25,166 --> 01:22:26,625
<i>Take it really easy here.</i>

970
01:22:26,708 --> 01:22:30,000
<i>It's critical to stay away
from the photovoltaic panels.</i>

971
01:22:31,291 --> 01:22:33,250
<i>We could lose power to the entire ship.</i>

972
01:22:34,833 --> 01:22:35,666
<i>Permanently.</i>

973
01:22:36,208 --> 01:22:37,041

[Zoe grunts]

975
01:23:06,625 --> 01:23:08,208
I'm good. David, are you ready?

[grunts]

977
01:23:09,958 --> 01:23:10,791
Ready.

978
01:23:13,750 --> 01:23:15,916

You're good.

994
01:26:05,708 --> 01:26:07,333
Okay, I'm heading down the Kingfisher now.

01:27:01,291 --> 01:27:02,125
Fine.

<i>the liquid-oxygen pipe toward the back.</i>

1004
01:27:14,666 --> 01:27:16,166
- I see it.
- [Barnett] <i>Great.</i>

[air hissing]

1012

It's definitely not a hundred percent.

1013
01:27:43,291 --> 01:27:45,291
It's hard to tell
how much we're losing by sight.

[Barnett] <i>Let's just lose</i>
<i>as little as possible.</i>

We have enough
to fill up at least one cylinder.

[Barnett] <i>Copy that. Good so far.</i>

1020

[Zoe] <i>It's climbing.</i>

1026
01:28:53,208 --> 01:28:54,833
Oh, fucking A.

1027
01:28:54,916 --> 01:28:56,125
- Yes!
- [Zoe] <i>Still climbing.</i>

1028
01:28:56,208 --> 01:28:58,875
Okay, stay focused.
We've gotta get these cylinders filled.

1029
01:28:58,958 --> 01:29:01,041
<i>David, send the first one down.</i>

1030
01:29:01,125 --> 01:29:02,458
Copy. Coming down.

1031
01:29:11,166 --> 01:29:12,000
On the way.

1032
01:29:53,125 --> 01:29:55,041
[Zoe] <i>You enjoying the view</i>
<i>up there, David?</i>

1033
01:29:55,916 --> 01:29:57,166
Not funny, Zoe.

1034
01:29:57,250 --> 01:29:58,333
[Zoe chuckling] <i>Okay.</i>

1035
01:29:59,750 --> 01:30:01,083
The first cylinder's full.

1036
01:30:01,708 --> 01:30:02,833
I'm uncoupling it now.

1037
01:30:03,875 --> 01:30:06,250
<i>Still got plenty of oxygen left
in the big tank.</i>

1038
01:30:06,750 --> 01:30:07,916
[David] Ready when you are.

1039
01:30:09,916 --> 01:30:11,625
- [Zoe] <i>Coming out.</i>
- Okay.

1040
01:30:26,916 --> 01:30:29,541
<i>MTS,</i> we have the first cylinder.

1041
01:30:29,625 --> 01:30:31,000
[Barnett] <i>Great. Copy that.</i>

1042
01:30:33,208 --> 01:30:35,000
[David] Second cylinder is on its way.

1043
01:30:46,791 --> 01:30:48,250
How's it going in there, Zoe?

1044
01:30:48,875 --> 01:30:51,333
[Zoe] <i>The tank's still leaking,</i>

- It look... What...? What's going on?

1047
01:31:01,208 --> 01:31:04,958
We're getting a solar storm warning.
Abort, EV1! Abort, EV2!

Oh, God.

1050
01:31:11,208 --> 01:31:12,583
How much time do we have?

1051
01:31:12,666 --> 01:31:14,000
[Barnett] <i>Twenty minutes.</i>

1052
01:31:18,708 --> 01:31:20,916
Zoe! Come on! Let's go!

1053
01:31:21,000 --> 01:31:22,583
No. We can't just leave this here.

1054

<i>This is the oxygen for Michael.</i>

1055
01:31:24,625 --> 01:31:26,708
There isn't enough time.
You're gonna have to leave it.

[Barnett] <i>It's a coronal mass ejection.</i>

1057
01:31:29,250 --> 01:31:31,208

1058
01:31:31,291 --> 01:31:32,916
<i>You need to head back right now!</i>

01:32:17,541 --> 01:32:18,500
- Okay.
- Good?

1069
01:32:18,583 --> 01:32:19,416
I'm heading up.

1070
01:32:37,541 --> 01:32:38,375
[Michael] Right.

1071
01:32:40,500 --> 01:32:41,541
Yeah.

1072
01:32:42,791 --> 01:32:43,625
Shit.

[alarm wailing]

01:32:49,083 --> 01:32:50,583
Zoe? David? Status check.

1075
01:32:53,833 --> 01:32:55,708

- Close the shutters.
- Got it.

1081
01:33:32,166 --> 01:33:33,000
Stay back there.

Zoe?

01:34:32,041 --> 01:34:33,416
Shit. Zoe, can you hear me?

1093
01:34:36,583 --> 01:34:37,541
[Zoe] I can't slow down.

- Get back.
- David, it's gone.

Look.

1112
01:36:48,625 --> 01:36:50,958
We've still got a full tank
leaking up there.

1113
01:36:53,208 --> 01:36:54,208
We're gonna lose it.

1114

If we can get to it...

1115
01:37:03,708 --> 01:37:05,416
the three of us can still make it.

1116
01:37:08,500 --> 01:37:10,583
Right now, the storm is lethal out there.

1117
01:37:11,625 --> 01:37:12,875
Maybe we can wait it out.

1118
01:37:14,750 --> 01:37:16,416
How long is the storm gonna last?

1119
01:37:21,500 --> 01:37:22,416
Uh...

Michael...

Why do you want to, mate?
You don't have the trainings.

1124
01:37:50,541 --> 01:37:52,958
If you don't make it back,
one of us dies too.

01:38:37,791 --> 01:38:38,916
- I'm willing.
- [Zoe] I'll go.

1126
01:38:42,166 --> 01:38:43,125
I can do it.

1127
01:38:48,625 --> 01:38:49,458
I can do it.

1128
01:38:57,166 --> 01:38:58,166
Yeah.

1129
01:38:59,125 --> 01:38:59,958

- Wait.
- [Zoe] David.

I can't let you do this.

1132
01:39:06,041 --> 01:39:08,083
So make it back home...

1133
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:10,500
go have a kid...

1134
01:39:12,041 --> 01:39:14,458
and send them to Yale, okay? [sobs]
