Two clusters: one at a hotel,
the other at a health club.

175
00:13:01,572 --> 00:13:04,533
Five dead, encephalitis.

176
00:13:04,701 --> 00:13:08,788
And there's the man on the bus in Tokyo.

177
00:13:08,955 --> 00:13:13,084
- Three dead in that cluster.
-Any of them travel to China or London?

195
00:14:38,461 --> 00:14:42,548
I was reading that last summer they had
an outbreak of enterovirus encephalitis.

196
00:14:42,715 --> 00:14:44,925
A hundred and three cases,
mainly children.

197
00:14:45,093 --> 00:14:47,720
Well, it's probably too cold up there
for that right now.

198
00:14:47,887 --> 00:14:50,848
As of last night,
there were five deaths and 32 cases.

199
00:14:51,015 --> 00:14:53,017
There's a cluster
in an elementary school.

That's the kind of thing
you have to be prepared for.

This is all just, you know, a precaution.
They're, you know, just making sure.

222
00:16:29,614 --> 00:16:32,241
But you were with them.
You could still get it.

223
00:16:32,408 --> 00:16:36,537
No, I won't. Um,
they said this happens really, really fast.

224

-No, no, no. Honey, no, no.

233

235
00:17:16,702 --> 00:17:20,288
Honey, you're here now, you know.
I'm happy about that.

236
00:17:20,456 --> 00:17:22,499
I'm happy about that.

237
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:25,460
When are you coming home?

238
00:17:25,628 --> 00:17:28,130
Soon. Very soon. They, you know...

239
00:17:28,297 --> 00:17:31,466
- Why don't you go, uh, to your mom's?
-No.

240
00:17:31,634 --> 00:17:34,887
- Just stay in Wisconsin.
-No. She doesn't need me.

241
00:17:35,054 --> 00:17:39,349
She's got Dan. I live here.

242
00:17:41,435 --> 00:17:44,521
You don't have anybody.
I'm not leaving you.

243
00:17:44,814 --> 00:17:48,984
OFFICIAL 1: We have 47 cases
and eight deaths as of 5 this afternoon.

244
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:51,653
It's a weekend.
These numbers might be low.

245
00:17:51,821 --> 00:17:54,865
People are staying home for a couple days,
see if they get better.

246
00:17:55,032 --> 00:17:57,909
At this point, I think
we have to believe this is respiratory.

247
00:17:58,077 --> 00:18:00,829
- Maybe fomites too.
-What's that, fomites?

248
00:18:00,997 --> 00:18:04,208
Uh, it refers to transmission
from surfaces.

249
00:18:04,375 --> 00:18:07,795
The average person touches their face
2- or 3000 times a day.

250
00:18:07,962 --> 00:18:12,462
- Two- or 3000 times a day?
-Three to five times every waking minute.

251
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:16,345
In between, we're touching doorknobs...

252
00:18:16,512 --> 00:18:19,223
...water fountains,
elevator buttons and each other.

253
00:18:19,390 --> 00:18:21,809
Those things become fomites.

254
00:18:21,976 --> 00:18:25,354
Is this something we wanna release
to the press? Respiratory and fomites?

255
00:18:25,521 --> 00:18:29,191
- How's the public gonna react?
-Hard to say. A plastic shark in a movie...

256
00:18:29,358 --> 00:18:32,861
...will keep people from getting
in the ocean, but a warning on cigarettes--

257
00:18:33,029 --> 00:18:36,532
We need to walk the governor through this
before we freak everybody out.

258
00:18:36,699 --> 00:18:40,911
I mean, heh, we can't even tell people
right now what they should be afraid of.

259
00:18:41,078 --> 00:18:44,206
We tried that with swine flu.
All we did was get healthy people scared.

260
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:46,166
It's the biggest shopping weekend
of the year.

261
00:18:46,334 --> 00:18:48,127
OFFICIAL 2:
We need to consider closing schools.

262
00:18:48,294 --> 00:18:51,547
And who stays home with the kids?
People that work at stores.

263
00:18:51,714 --> 00:18:53,966
Government workers.
People that work at hospitals.

264
00:18:54,133 --> 00:18:57,678
When will we know what this is?
What causes it, what cures it?

265
00:18:57,845 --> 00:19:00,138
Things that keep people calm.

266
00:19:00,306 --> 00:19:04,806
What we need to determine is this:

267
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:07,896
For every person who gets sick...

268
00:19:08,064 --> 00:19:11,650
...how many other people
are they likely to infect?

269
00:19:12,276 --> 00:19:15,487
So for seasonal flu,
that's usually about one.

270
00:19:15,655 --> 00:19:19,241
Smallpox, on the other hand,
it's over three.

271
00:19:19,408 --> 00:19:20,867
Now, before we had a vaccine...

272
00:19:21,035 --> 00:19:25,372
...polio spread at a rate
between four and six.

273
00:19:25,539 --> 00:19:28,583
Now, we call that number...

274
00:19:29,293 --> 00:19:30,961
...the R-nought.

275
00:19:31,128 --> 00:19:35,628
R stands for the reproductive rate
of the virus.

276
00:19:36,133 --> 00:19:38,426
Any ideas what that might be for this?

277
00:19:38,594 --> 00:19:42,764
How fast it multiplies depends
on a variety of factors.

278
00:19:42,932 --> 00:19:45,768
The incubation period,
how long a person is contagious.

279
00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:49,188
Sometimes people can be contagious
without even having symptoms.

280
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,023
We need to know that too.

281
00:19:51,190 --> 00:19:55,360
We need to know how big the population
of people susceptible to the virus might be.

282
00:19:55,528 --> 00:19:58,614
So far that appears to be everyone
with hands, a mouth and a nose.

283
00:19:58,781 --> 00:20:02,785
Once we know the R-nought, we'll be able
to get a handle on the scale of the epidemic.

284
00:20:02,952 --> 00:20:05,788
So it's an epidemic now.
An epidemic of what?

285
00:20:05,955 --> 00:20:07,748
We sent samples to the CDC.

286
00:20:08,249 --> 00:20:12,749
In 72 hours, we'll know what it is,
if we're lucky.

287
00:20:13,462 --> 00:20:15,297
Clearly, we're not lucky.

-Oh.

296
00:21:22,364 --> 00:21:24,699
It's pleomorphic,

297

I see structures on the surface
that look like glycoproteins...

298
00:21:27,953 --> 00:21:30,372
...but there's nothing
morphologically pathognomonic.

299
00:21:30,539 --> 00:21:33,542
We tested all her antibodies.
I didn't see much cross-reactivity.

300
00:21:33,709 --> 00:21:37,087
Her body had no idea what to do with it.
It just kept amplifying.

HEXTALL:
Send it to Sussman in San Francisco.

If he doesn't know what it is,
nobody does.

303
00:21:41,550 --> 00:21:46,050
It shows novel characteristics
and appears to be chimeric in origin.

304
00:21:46,347 --> 00:21:50,847
Virus is 15 to 19 kilobases in length
and containing six to 1O genes.

305
00:21:52,478 --> 00:21:54,188
Typical of a paramyxovirus.
