1
00:00:06,507 --> 00:00:09,577
(baby crying)

2
00:00:15,316 --> 00:00:25,456
(chopping and cracking sounds)

3
00:00:25,459 --> 00:00:39,509
(chopping and cracking sounds)

4
00:00:39,507 --> 00:00:48,017
(ominous music)

5
00:00:56,190 --> 00:00:59,660
Katie: So you'd leave the
store for some big shot?

6
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:00,960
Drew: He's not
just some bigshot.

7
00:01:00,961 --> 00:01:02,261
I mean Lance Bryant
happens to be

8
00:01:02,263 --> 00:01:03,703
one of the stores
biggest customers.

9
00:01:03,697 --> 00:01:05,867
The place wouldn't
exist without him.

10
00:01:05,866 --> 00:01:07,336
Katie: Right.

11
00:01:07,335 --> 00:01:10,135
Drew: And he's also one of the
most successful guys in town.

12
00:01:10,138 --> 00:01:12,768
You know, he made the
"Forty under 40" list.

13
00:01:12,773 --> 00:01:14,113
Katie: Yeah.

14
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:15,808
Katie: I know, but, okay.

15
00:01:15,809 --> 00:01:17,179
Drew: Twice Katie.
Nobody does that.

16
00:01:17,178 --> 00:01:21,008
Katie: That sounds very
impressive, it does.

17
00:01:21,014 --> 00:01:22,554
Katie: But I mean you've been
working towards something

18
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,790
and I just don't know
that it's necessarily

19
00:01:26,787 --> 00:01:32,887
the smartest thing to just
pick up and start over.

20
00:01:32,893 --> 00:01:34,133
Drew: I don't think
you understand.

21
00:01:34,128 --> 00:01:36,498
The guy is super loaded.

22
00:01:36,497 --> 00:01:40,227
I'll probably get paid at least
triple what I'm making now.

23
00:01:40,234 --> 00:01:42,074
It's not starting over.

24
00:01:42,069 --> 00:01:43,399
Katie: Okay, but
what will the job be?

25
00:01:43,404 --> 00:01:45,244
I mean, what does he even do?

26
00:01:45,239 --> 00:01:46,569
Drew: What does he even do?

27
00:01:46,574 --> 00:01:48,244
What does it even matter?

28
00:01:48,242 --> 00:01:51,682
Katie: Oh God.

29
00:01:51,679 --> 00:01:53,349
Drew: Okay, the
man sweats success.

30
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:56,017
Ever read his book?

31
00:01:56,016 --> 00:01:57,716
Katie: No.

32
00:01:57,718 --> 00:01:59,548
Drew: Well, there you go.

33
00:01:59,553 --> 00:02:03,093
Katie: Have you read his book?

34
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:06,760
Drew: I've read the
first chapter of it.

35
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:08,060
Katie: Well, there you go.

36
00:02:08,061 --> 00:02:09,431
Drew: Well, I've
read pieces of it.

37
00:02:09,430 --> 00:02:10,560
I've read more than you have.

38
00:02:10,564 --> 00:02:12,204
Katie: I just wonder
if you'd actually,

39
00:02:12,200 --> 00:02:14,600
you know, if you're going
to be happier doing it.

40
00:02:14,602 --> 00:02:16,842
Drew: Yeah.

41
00:02:16,837 --> 00:02:18,667
Katie: Really?

42
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:20,072
Drew: Yeah.

43
00:02:20,073 --> 00:02:22,613
Drew: I mean, I'm
nearly 30 Katie.

44
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:24,140
I can't be shoving
diningroom tables

45
00:02:24,144 --> 00:02:25,984
into hatchbacks for
the rest of my life.

46
00:02:25,979 --> 00:02:27,719
Katie: Hmm.

47
00:02:27,715 --> 00:02:30,715
Drew: I got to strike now.

48
00:02:30,718 --> 00:02:33,788
Strike that hot iron.

49
00:02:33,787 --> 00:02:37,427
Mr. Clayton: Drew. Drew
DeLaney. I need you out back.

50
00:02:37,425 --> 00:02:40,655
Drew: I got five more
minutes Mr. Clayton.

51
00:02:40,661 --> 00:02:50,201
(sighs) See what I'm
dealing with here?

52
00:02:50,204 --> 00:02:52,774
Got to get out of this place.

53
00:02:52,773 --> 00:02:54,343
Katie: The grass
is always greener.

54
00:02:54,342 --> 00:02:57,182
Mr. Clayton, he's been
good to you. Okay?

55
00:02:57,177 --> 00:02:59,707
Drew: No, Mr. Clayton can
eat a hot bowl of dicks,

56
00:02:59,713 --> 00:03:01,753
is what I think.

57
00:03:01,749 --> 00:03:03,879
Katie: Wow.

58
00:03:05,719 --> 00:03:07,559
Lance: That right there.

59
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:10,185
That mother fuckin'
shit right there

60
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:13,630
is what pisses me off
more than anything else.

61
00:03:13,627 --> 00:03:18,127
You can't just come to me

62
00:03:18,131 --> 00:03:22,571
to my place of residence.

63
00:03:22,570 --> 00:03:27,440
My mother fuckin' doorstep
and expect a handout.

64
00:03:27,441 --> 00:03:30,581
A free fuckin' handout
that will not benefit me

65
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:33,948
in any way, shape, or
mother fuckin' form.

66
00:03:33,947 --> 00:03:42,157
Drew: Uh, so did you end
up buying the cookies?

67
00:03:42,155 --> 00:03:43,985
Lance: What the?

68
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,461
It's not about whether or not

69
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,599
I bought the cookies or didn't.

70
00:03:47,595 --> 00:03:50,655
It's about these mother
fuckers are success suckers.

71
00:03:50,664 --> 00:03:51,974
Didn't you read my book?

72
00:03:51,965 --> 00:03:53,265
Drew: Well, I ...

73
00:03:53,267 --> 00:03:55,537
Lance: Goddamn man.

74
00:04:00,741 --> 00:04:04,211
Chapter two, paragraph six.

75
00:04:04,211 --> 00:04:07,251
Yes, those who refuse
to work for success

76
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,647
are bloodsucking leaches,

77
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:12,590
leaches who will
success suck you dry

78
00:04:12,586 --> 00:04:14,786
unless you annihilate them.

79
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:17,058
Drew: Oh yeah, annihilation.

80
00:04:17,057 --> 00:04:17,957
Lance: Yeah.

81
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:19,488
Drew: Got it Mr. Bryant.

82
00:04:19,493 --> 00:04:21,533
Lance: Dammit Drew.
Just call me Lance.

83
00:04:21,529 --> 00:04:24,569
Drew: Yeah Lance.

84
00:04:24,565 --> 00:04:27,065
Lance: Now in summation.

85
00:04:27,067 --> 00:04:28,597
If those little
bitches come calling

86
00:04:28,602 --> 00:04:30,372
and asking for handouts
while you're here

87
00:04:30,371 --> 00:04:33,841
house-sitting you
have the green light

88
00:04:33,841 --> 00:04:40,551
to use this on their asses.

89
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:44,248
Drew: Uh, we're still talking
about girl scouts. Right?

90
00:04:44,251 --> 00:04:45,421
Lance: Yeah. This
may be air-powered,

91
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:47,989
but let me tell you something.

92
00:04:47,988 --> 00:04:50,518
This can put a hole the
size of a grapefruit

93
00:04:50,524 --> 00:04:54,564
through a squirrel
from 90 yards away.

94
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:55,862
Lance: Uh-huh

95
00:04:55,863 --> 00:04:57,773
Lance: Watch yourself.

96
00:04:57,765 --> 00:04:58,865
Drew: Oh.

97
00:04:58,866 --> 00:05:02,566
Lance: Huh! Bam!

98
00:05:02,570 --> 00:05:04,970
Lance: Drew.

99
00:05:04,972 --> 00:05:07,112
Lance: Let's take a walk.

100
00:05:20,988 --> 00:05:22,718
Lance: All right.

101
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:25,333
Don't let Mr. Baldwin get down
there by the horse stables.

102
00:05:25,325 --> 00:05:26,825
All right. If he gets to dig in.

103
00:05:26,827 --> 00:05:28,697
It will be a horrible mess.

104
00:05:30,197 --> 00:05:32,127
Drew: You got horses?

105
00:05:32,132 --> 00:05:33,972
That's fantastic.

106
00:05:33,967 --> 00:05:35,597
I've never actually seen a
horse live in person before.

107
00:05:35,603 --> 00:05:36,973
I've always kind of wanted to.

108
00:05:36,970 --> 00:05:37,640
I've seen them in movies.

109
00:05:37,638 --> 00:05:38,938
Lance: Stables.

110
00:05:38,939 --> 00:05:45,849
You hear me say anything
about owning a damn horse?

111
00:05:47,214 --> 00:05:49,124
Lance: Oh shit! I almost forgot.

112
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:54,016
Okay, so something, uh, well,

113
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:58,661
someone may be arriving
before I get back.

114
00:05:58,659 --> 00:06:01,189
Special arrangement.

115
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:03,404
International arrangement.

116
00:06:03,397 --> 00:06:06,297
Which could bring about

117
00:06:06,299 --> 00:06:08,499
some unfortunate
misunderstandings

118
00:06:08,502 --> 00:06:13,842
if not handled with a
clear and focused mind.

119
00:06:13,841 --> 00:06:15,811
You feel me?

120
00:06:15,809 --> 00:06:19,409
Drew: Uh, I'm not sure I follow.

121
00:06:19,413 --> 00:06:20,983
Lance: Don't sweat it.

122
00:06:20,981 --> 00:06:24,991
Lance: You, just toss her
into my master bedroom

123
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:27,985
if she comes before I get back.

124
00:06:27,988 --> 00:06:29,788
That's it. You feel me?

125
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:31,120
Drew: Oh yeah.

126
00:06:31,124 --> 00:06:32,164
Drew: I feel you.

127
00:06:32,159 --> 00:06:33,759
Lance: All right.
See you do good

128
00:06:33,761 --> 00:06:35,401
and you are going
to earn yourself

129
00:06:35,395 --> 00:06:37,865
a spot in the big leagues.

130
00:06:37,865 --> 00:06:40,125
All right? Ha-ha.

131
00:06:40,133 --> 00:06:46,913
A lot of great things
going on at Team Lance.

132
00:06:46,907 --> 00:06:50,037
Huh? Great things.

133
00:06:53,080 --> 00:07:04,890

(lyrics) Hells
yeah, mother fucker,

00:07:53,841 --> 00:07:56,841
Fresh up in this big hatch.

140

Marta: I'm Marta.

142
00:08:01,248 --> 00:08:03,218
Mr. Lance tells you
coming to watch his house

143
00:08:03,216 --> 00:08:05,816
and to take care of his doggie.

144
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:07,889
Drew: Yeah, yeah,
that's right, that's -

145
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:09,058
Marta: I'll be in
and out all weekend

146
00:08:09,056 --> 00:08:10,686
cleaning Mr. Lance home,

147
00:08:10,691 --> 00:08:15,501
but please, do no
mess up nothing! Hmm?

148
00:08:26,674 --> 00:08:34,684
Drew: Mr. Baldwin, I presume.

149
00:08:34,682 --> 00:08:38,692
(lyrics) You make
me feel like a dog

150
00:08:38,686 --> 00:08:41,686
You got me on your leash

151
00:08:41,689 --> 00:08:43,759
Drew: Here you go Mr. Baldwin.

152
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:45,527
(lyrics) You make
a grown man pant

153
00:08:45,525 --> 00:08:48,795
You make a grown man dance

154
00:08:48,796 --> 00:08:54,096
Drew: Time to eat Mr.
Baldwin. Eat it. Come on.

155
00:08:54,101 --> 00:08:55,201
(lyrics) You got
me on all fours

156
00:08:55,202 --> 00:08:56,342
On my hands and knees

157
00:08:56,336 --> 00:08:58,536
Just take me for a walk

158
00:08:58,538 --> 00:09:00,968
Drew: Look. It's delicious.

159
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:05,684
(lyrics) Get me off of my feet

160
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,679

Like a prince [unintelligible]

165
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:43,580
You make a grown man wild

166
00:09:43,583 --> 00:09:47,523
You make a grown man a child

167
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:51,190
You make me feel something new

168
00:09:51,191 --> 00:09:54,861
I could learn from you

169
00:09:54,862 --> 00:09:58,732
Just give me all your mind

Although local and federal

173
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:29,660
law enforcements won't
offer up many details

174
00:10:29,663 --> 00:10:31,833
on the investigation
they do say that

175
00:10:31,832 --> 00:10:35,972
this human trafficking ring
may involve over 35 countries.

Agent Eddie Granger:
What we're looking at

177
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,070
is as an exploitation
scandal, uh, that is

178
00:10:40,073 --> 00:10:42,483
more complex and
more sadistic, um,

179
00:10:42,475 --> 00:10:45,845
than any that we've
encountered here

180
00:10:45,846 --> 00:10:49,346
in the United States of
America on U.S. soil.

181
00:10:49,349 --> 00:10:51,989
Um, so the citizens ...

182
00:10:51,985 --> 00:10:54,085
(Doorbell rings)

183
00:10:54,087 --> 00:10:58,027
which we hold dear, we
are working diligently -

184
00:10:58,025 --> 00:10:59,355
Kamal: Excuse me sir.

185
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:01,129
So sorry to bother you on
this glorious day, but -

186
00:11:01,128 --> 00:11:05,528
Drew: Kamal? Drew DeLaney.

187
00:11:05,532 --> 00:11:10,202
Emily Dickinson High?

188
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:14,473
Mr. Martineau's history class?

189
00:11:14,474 --> 00:11:16,984
Come on man! We made
that Vietnam video.

190
00:11:16,977 --> 00:11:18,747
Kamal: Yeah, Drew. Right?

191
00:11:18,746 --> 00:11:19,606
Drew: Yeah.

192
00:11:19,612 --> 00:11:20,712
Kamal: Yeah, I'm sorry.

193
00:11:20,714 --> 00:11:22,124
I guess I didn't recognize you

194
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:26,045
with a shirt and the
tie, it's corporate.

195
00:11:26,053 --> 00:11:30,623
Um, you've done pretty
well for yourself.

196
00:11:30,623 --> 00:11:33,563
Drew: Oh! This house?

197
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:36,860
Actually it belongs
to Lance Bryant.

198
00:11:36,864 --> 00:11:39,234
Kamal: Who is that?

199
00:11:39,232 --> 00:11:41,472
Drew: You don't know
who Lance Bryant is?

200
00:11:41,468 --> 00:11:44,098
Kamal: (nods no)

201
00:11:44,104 --> 00:11:47,014
Drew: Anyway, if nothing
goes wrong while I'm here

202
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:49,177
he's going to give me a job.

203
00:11:49,176 --> 00:11:50,536
Kamal: Really.

204
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:52,713
Kamal: Nice. House
sitting full time?

205
00:11:53,346 --> 00:11:56,046
Drew: Uh, no, probably
more like, you know,

206
00:11:56,049 --> 00:11:58,889
being his trusted
right hand man.

207
00:11:58,886 --> 00:12:01,186
Kamal: Right hand man?

208
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:04,828
Kamal: Oh, I get
it. Right hand man.

209
00:12:04,825 --> 00:12:06,825
Drew: No. You've
grown up so much.

210
00:12:06,827 --> 00:12:08,097
Kamal: Right hand
man you're gonna ...

211
00:12:08,095 --> 00:12:09,855
Drew: Don't, no, just don't.

212
00:12:09,863 --> 00:12:11,973
Kamal: He's a powerful man.

213
00:12:11,965 --> 00:12:14,095
Kamal: Powerful men need a hand.

214
00:12:14,101 --> 00:12:16,941
Drew: How do you like it?

215
00:12:16,937 --> 00:12:18,637
Drew: You like it.

216
00:12:20,007 --> 00:12:21,937
Kamal: You got speed, speed.

217
00:12:21,942 --> 00:12:23,582
Drew: How does that feel?

218
00:12:23,576 --> 00:12:24,736
Drew: Job training. Right?

219
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,384
You're training from
a right hand man now.

220
00:12:26,379 --> 00:12:29,719
Kamal: What are you digging for?

221
00:12:29,716 --> 00:12:32,446
Delivery Guy: Now don't
stop on my account.

222
00:12:32,452 --> 00:12:33,952
Love that shit!

223
00:12:33,954 --> 00:12:39,064
You're lucky I'm
working. Especially you.

224
00:12:39,059 --> 00:12:40,559
Anyway, who lives here?

225
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:43,060
Drew: I do. I mean
for the time being.

226
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:44,663
Delivery Guy: I
need a signature.

227
00:12:44,664 --> 00:12:52,174
Drew: Sure. Yep.

228
00:12:52,172 --> 00:12:54,412
Uh, so you, I guess
you could put it, uh,

229
00:12:54,407 --> 00:12:56,007
right in here if you want.

230
00:12:56,009 --> 00:12:58,009
Delivery Guy: Nah!
That's where it stops.

231
00:12:58,011 --> 00:13:02,781
I don't haul shit.

232
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:12,032
(ominous music)

233
00:13:12,025 --> 00:13:14,125
Drew: Hey man.

234
00:13:14,127 --> 00:13:15,857
Hey you mind maybe giving
me a hand with this?

235
00:13:15,863 --> 00:13:17,463
We just got to carry it,
carry it around back.

236
00:13:17,464 --> 00:13:19,234
Just take about five minutes.

237
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:21,002
Kamal: I don't know.

238
00:13:21,001 --> 00:13:23,801
I still got a lot
of houses to hit.

239
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:28,013
Drew: Yeah, sure. I
totally understand.

240
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:39,692
Come back later maybe.
Swing back around. Yeah.

241
00:13:39,686 --> 00:13:42,156
Kamal: Um, good luck with
the house sitting though.

242
00:13:42,155 --> 00:13:44,355
Drew: Yeah, should
be, should be fun.

243
00:13:44,357 --> 00:13:45,987
Kamal: Yeah.

244
00:13:45,993 --> 00:13:47,263
Drew: It was cool
seeing you man.

245
00:13:47,260 --> 00:13:48,730
Kamal: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

246
00:13:48,728 --> 00:13:50,158
Drew: It's been a long time.

247
00:13:51,364 --> 00:13:54,034
Kamal: Cool. Good luck.

248
00:13:54,034 --> 00:13:55,974
Drew: Thanks man. You too.

249
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,815
Drew: 10 speeds?

250
00:14:14,821 --> 00:14:22,801
Drew: 21. Wow. Do you
use, like, all of them?

251
00:14:24,331 --> 00:14:25,671
Drew: Oh my gosh man.

252
00:14:25,665 --> 00:14:32,465
Kamal: Yeah.

253
00:14:32,472 --> 00:14:34,742
Drew: So what's in the case?

254
00:14:34,741 --> 00:14:36,211
(chop)

255
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:37,909
Drew: Whoa!

256
00:14:37,911 --> 00:14:39,381
Kamal: SlicePro is top
of the line cutlery.

257
00:14:39,379 --> 00:14:42,219
Won the Bronze at the
Homemakers Expo in '98,

258
00:14:42,215 --> 00:14:44,075
then again in '02.

259
00:14:44,084 --> 00:14:46,224
The shits legit.

260
00:14:46,219 --> 00:14:49,219
Drew: It seems very sharp.

261
00:14:49,222 --> 00:14:51,022
Kamal: So how much should
I put you down for?

262
00:14:51,024 --> 00:14:52,364
The extended chefs arsenal?

263
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:54,359
Perhaps the nuclear
family traditional set?

264
00:14:54,361 --> 00:14:56,131
Hey, either way.

265
00:14:56,129 --> 00:14:57,859
I'll throw in a pair of scissors

266
00:14:57,864 --> 00:14:59,804
that can cut through a penny.

267
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:00,699
On the house.

268
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:02,540
Drew: Thanks man, but I just,

269
00:15:02,535 --> 00:15:04,365
I just can't really afford
any right now, you know.

270
00:15:04,371 --> 00:15:06,411
Maybe if I get this
job I can totally -

271
00:15:06,406 --> 00:15:07,936
Kamal: Playing hard ball, huh?

272
00:15:07,941 --> 00:15:09,681
All right. How about this?

273
00:15:09,676 --> 00:15:13,206
I'll throw in the fish
that you've been looking at

274
00:15:13,213 --> 00:15:17,023
that opens bottles.

275
00:15:17,017 --> 00:15:20,087
Huh? Life of the party here.

276
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:25,927
I work on 100%
commission, you know.

277
00:15:30,897 --> 00:15:32,797
Drew: Hey why don't you,

278
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,969
why don't you hang
out for a while man?

279
00:15:34,968 --> 00:15:36,338
I've got this huge place

280
00:15:36,336 --> 00:15:40,766
all to myself, you know,
we could grab a drink,

281
00:15:40,773 --> 00:15:41,943
reminisce about the old days.

282
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:43,341
Kamal: Nah, I better not man.

283
00:15:43,343 --> 00:15:47,183
Drew: Come on Kam.
It will be fun.

284
00:15:47,180 --> 00:15:52,820
Kamal: It's Kamal,
and I think I'm good.

285
00:15:52,819 --> 00:15:56,889
Drew: Yeah. Yeah,
okay, yeah. Sorry man.

286
00:15:56,889 --> 00:16:03,329
(dog steps)

287
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:05,130
Kamal: Was that a thong?

288
00:16:05,132 --> 00:16:07,632
Drew: Yeah.

289
00:16:07,634 --> 00:16:09,904
(ominous music)

290
00:16:09,902 --> 00:16:12,672
Drew: The door was open man.

291
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:15,482
(ominous music)

292
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:18,545
Drew: Mr. Baldwin.

293
00:16:18,545 --> 00:16:24,215
Look at this mess man.

294
00:16:24,217 --> 00:16:26,847
Drew: Do you leave the
door open? He told me -

295
00:16:29,989 --> 00:16:32,489
Kamal: Holy shit!

296
00:16:32,492 --> 00:16:34,132
Drew: What?

297
00:16:34,127 --> 00:16:36,627
Kamal: I think there's
someone in there.

298
00:16:36,629 --> 00:16:38,829
Drew: What are
you talking about?

299
00:16:38,831 --> 00:16:42,601
(ominous music)

300
00:16:42,602 --> 00:16:45,072
Drew: Holy shit.

301
00:16:45,072 --> 00:16:46,342
Kamal: Are you fucking with me?

302
00:16:46,339 --> 00:16:47,339
Drew: No, I though you
were fucking with me man.

303
00:16:47,340 --> 00:16:48,540
Kamal: Why would
I fuck with you?

304
00:16:48,541 --> 00:16:49,781
Drew: I was going to
ask you the same thing.

305
00:16:49,776 --> 00:16:51,736
Kamal: Someone is
fucking with us.

306
00:16:51,744 --> 00:16:53,384
Drew: Someone is
fucking with us.

307
00:16:53,380 --> 00:16:55,220
Kamal: Why the fuck
would a dead chick

308
00:16:55,215 --> 00:16:56,745
get delivered
here. Right? Right?

309
00:16:56,749 --> 00:16:59,089
I mean this is Lance
Bryant's house. Yeah?

310
00:16:59,086 --> 00:17:00,516
Drew: Yeah.

311
00:17:00,520 --> 00:17:01,790
Kamal: And there's no
way that a dead chick

312
00:17:01,788 --> 00:17:03,488
would get delivered here.

313
00:17:03,490 --> 00:17:04,590
Drew: No.

314
00:17:04,757 --> 00:17:08,097
Drew: It doesn't make sense.

315
00:17:08,095 --> 00:17:10,095
Kamal: It doesn't
make any sense at all.

316
00:17:10,097 --> 00:17:11,927
Drew: There's no way
it's a dead chick.

317
00:17:11,931 --> 00:17:13,871
Drew: It's a dead chick.

318
00:17:13,866 --> 00:17:15,766
Drew: Who do you think she is?

319
00:17:15,768 --> 00:17:18,108
Kamal: You want to check
her for ID be my guest.

320
00:17:19,005 --> 00:17:20,435
Drew: Lance told me
to keep an eye out

321
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,680
for something, something
that might raise eyebrows.

322
00:17:22,675 --> 00:17:24,535
Kamal: Consider my
eyebrows fucking raised.

323
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:26,854
Drew: He figured
a woman was coming

324
00:17:26,846 --> 00:17:28,776
to stay with him,
but he was so vague.

325
00:17:28,781 --> 00:17:30,451
You know he called
it, he called it

326
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:32,720
an international arrangement.

327
00:17:32,719 --> 00:17:35,719
Kamal: Sounds like a
mail order bride to me.

328
00:17:35,722 --> 00:17:37,062
Drew: Is that what this is?

329
00:17:37,056 --> 00:17:39,226
Kamal: How long do
you know this guy?

330
00:17:39,226 --> 00:17:43,056
Drew: Uh, I mean he
comes into the store

331
00:17:43,062 --> 00:17:45,002
like, once a month, you know,

332
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:47,067
to buy a bunch of stuff.

333
00:17:47,066 --> 00:17:49,036
Kamal: So not very
well then. Huh?

334
00:17:49,035 --> 00:17:50,665
Drew: Well I mean
we usually chit-chat

335
00:17:50,670 --> 00:17:52,440
while I load things
into his car.

336
00:17:52,439 --> 00:17:54,269
Kamal: Chit-chat. Jesus.

337
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:57,614
Drew: Well, it's longer
than a chit-chat.

338
00:17:57,610 --> 00:17:58,650
Drew: It's like
conversations, we talk.

339
00:17:58,645 --> 00:18:00,545
Kamal: It's a chit-chat man.

340
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:01,947
It's a chit-chat.

341
00:18:01,948 --> 00:18:03,148
You chit-chat with this
guy and you don't know him.

342
00:18:03,150 --> 00:18:04,680
Drew: It's like once a month

343
00:18:04,684 --> 00:18:05,894
I talk to him for awhile.

344
00:18:05,885 --> 00:18:07,385
Kamal: Yeah-yeah.

345
00:18:07,387 --> 00:18:09,057
So you don't know him that well

346
00:18:09,055 --> 00:18:10,555
and it's quite
possible that he could

347
00:18:10,557 --> 00:18:13,587
be into some weird fucking shit.

348
00:18:13,593 --> 00:18:15,303
Drew: No, Lance
Bryant is a legit guy.

349
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:16,725
Kamal: Yeah.

350
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,369
Drew: There's got to be a
reasonable explanation for this.

351
00:18:19,999 --> 00:18:25,969
Drew: (sighs) Oh my God.
What are we going to do?

352
00:18:25,972 --> 00:18:29,182
Kamal: We? Sorry man,
but this is your problem.

353
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:32,006
I got to get back to work.

354
00:18:32,011 --> 00:18:33,411
Drew: Wait! You got
to help me with this.

355
00:18:33,413 --> 00:18:34,483
We're friends.

356
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:36,751
Kamal: (laughs) Sure man.

357
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:40,489
Look, call the fucking police.

358
00:18:40,487 --> 00:18:42,087
Let them sort it out, okay.

359
00:18:42,088 --> 00:18:43,618
Drew: If I call the police

360
00:18:43,623 --> 00:18:45,233
than Lance will get arrested.

361
00:18:45,225 --> 00:18:48,125
Okay, no, he told
me to handle this

362
00:18:48,127 --> 00:18:49,927
with a clear, focused
head is what he said.

363
00:18:49,929 --> 00:18:52,429
If I screw this
up there's no way

364
00:18:52,432 --> 00:18:55,072
I'm going aboard Team Lance.

365
00:18:55,067 --> 00:18:57,067
You got to help me.

366
00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:58,909
It's Team Lance Kamal.

367
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:05,175
(doorbell rings)

368
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:07,978
(Knocking)

369
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:13,650
(Doorbell rings)

370
00:19:13,653 --> 00:19:15,293
Spencer: Hello.

371
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:16,758
Spencer: Hi.

372
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:19,656
Spencer: Hi. I'm here to see
Lance Bryant, if I might.

373
00:19:19,659 --> 00:19:23,059
Drew: Lance isn't
home at the moment.

374
00:19:23,062 --> 00:19:24,932
Spencer: Who are you?

375
00:19:24,931 --> 00:19:26,971
Drew: We're his friends.

376
00:19:26,966 --> 00:19:28,636
We're friends of Lance's.

377
00:19:28,635 --> 00:19:31,435
Spencer: Friends?
Friends of Lance?

378
00:19:31,438 --> 00:19:32,638
Drew: Yeah.

379
00:19:32,639 --> 00:19:34,139
Spencer: You're both
friends of Lance Bryant?

380
00:19:34,140 --> 00:19:36,740
Drew: Yeah. We're kind
of busy at the moment

381
00:19:36,743 --> 00:19:38,013
so if you don't mind
maybe coming back later.

382
00:19:38,010 --> 00:19:39,350
We're going to head back.

383
00:19:39,346 --> 00:19:42,346
Spencer: Excuse me, excuse
me, excuse me, gentlemen,

384
00:19:42,349 --> 00:19:44,049
but this is a
neighborhood watch zone.

385
00:19:44,050 --> 00:19:45,720
And I happen to be
Lance's neighbor

386
00:19:45,718 --> 00:19:47,218
so maybe it's
appropriate for me to let

387
00:19:47,220 --> 00:19:48,520
the authorities know
you're inside of his house.

388
00:19:48,821 --> 00:19:50,661
Kamal: Please by all means.

389
00:19:50,657 --> 00:19:52,357
Drew: No, no, no.

390
00:19:52,359 --> 00:19:53,529
(Knocking)

391
00:19:53,526 --> 00:19:55,856
Drew: It's not, it's
not necessary, okay.

392
00:19:55,862 --> 00:19:58,372
Look, we're just ... Lance,
Lance is on vacation.

393
00:19:58,365 --> 00:20:00,865
Okay? And he asked me
to look after his place

394
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:02,537
until he gets back, that's all.

395
00:20:02,535 --> 00:20:03,595
Neighbor: Well he never told me

396
00:20:03,603 --> 00:20:05,003
anything about house sitters,

397
00:20:05,004 --> 00:20:07,014
so you can imagine how -

398
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:07,966
Kamal: I'm not house
sitting, for the record.

399
00:20:07,974 --> 00:20:09,514
Drew: I totally understand.

400
00:20:09,509 --> 00:20:11,239
Spencer: Okay. Record.

401
00:20:11,244 --> 00:20:14,954
Spencer: Okay. Well
I'm Spencer Shaw.

402
00:20:14,947 --> 00:20:16,377
I live right down the street,

403
00:20:16,383 --> 00:20:17,723
as I mentioned earlier,

404
00:20:17,717 --> 00:20:19,147
so if you need anything
while you're here

405
00:20:19,151 --> 00:20:20,451
just give me a jingle.

406
00:20:20,453 --> 00:20:21,993
Drew: Great.

407
00:20:21,988 --> 00:20:23,158
Drew: Oh doctor.

408
00:20:23,155 --> 00:20:25,215
Spencer: That's
right. MD and PhD.

409
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,434
Spencer: I did them both.

410
00:20:26,426 --> 00:20:28,126
Drew: Great. Good for
you. Congratulations.

411
00:20:28,127 --> 00:20:29,197
That's a lot of work.

412
00:20:29,195 --> 00:20:30,825
Spencer: Oh, and the mail. Yes.

413
00:20:30,830 --> 00:20:32,570
I came to give Lance his mail

414
00:20:32,565 --> 00:20:33,995
because unfortunately it gets

415
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,270
delivered to me by mistake.

416
00:20:35,268 --> 00:20:36,868
We have dunderheads
running our postal service

417
00:20:36,869 --> 00:20:38,039
here in the local area.

418
00:20:38,037 --> 00:20:39,707
So there's not a
day that pretty much

419
00:20:39,706 --> 00:20:41,366
doesn't go by where
there's postcards

420
00:20:41,374 --> 00:20:43,184
or some periodicals of some kind

421
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:44,935
that gets mistakenly -

422
00:20:44,944 --> 00:20:47,954
Kamal and Spencer: (Laugh)

423
00:20:47,947 --> 00:20:49,177
Drew: Thank you for doing that.

424
00:20:49,181 --> 00:20:50,721
That's so nice Dr. Shaw.

425
00:20:50,717 --> 00:20:52,487
Thank you. It was
nice meeting you.

426
00:20:52,485 --> 00:20:53,545
We'll see you around
the neighborhood

427
00:20:53,553 --> 00:20:55,493
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

428
00:20:56,723 --> 00:20:58,693
Spencer: Oh, and by the way.

429
00:20:58,691 --> 00:21:00,131
Just follow the exact sequence

430
00:21:00,126 --> 00:21:01,826
that's on the card
that I gave you

431
00:21:01,828 --> 00:21:05,598
number wise and my
phone will ring.

432
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:10,238
Drew: Wonderful.
Thank you. (sighs)

433
00:21:10,236 --> 00:21:11,996
Drew: Oh man. We
got to move fast.

434
00:21:12,004 --> 00:21:13,414
That guy is totally onto us.

435
00:21:13,406 --> 00:21:14,566
Kamal: Us?

436
00:21:14,574 --> 00:21:16,814
Kamal: Are you crazy?
This is all you.

437
00:21:16,809 --> 00:21:19,049
Drew: What? He saw
you, too, Kamal.

438
00:21:19,846 --> 00:21:23,116
Drew: So in his mind you're just

439
00:21:23,115 --> 00:21:24,445
as connected to this as I am.

440
00:21:24,451 --> 00:21:25,491
Kamal: Connected to what?

441
00:21:25,485 --> 00:21:26,315
Drew. This.

442
00:21:26,319 --> 00:21:27,989
Kamal: We didn't kill her.

443
00:21:27,987 --> 00:21:28,917
We didn't box her
up and ship her.

444
00:21:28,921 --> 00:21:29,791
We had nothing to do with this.

445
00:21:29,789 --> 00:21:30,889
Think about it.

446
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:32,390
If we never would
have looked in the box

447
00:21:32,392 --> 00:21:34,162
we never would
have known. Right?

448
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,200
Drew: Yeah.

449
00:21:36,195 --> 00:21:38,665
Kamal: The best thing we can
do is pretend nothing happened.

450
00:21:38,665 --> 00:21:41,465
Drew: Exactly. Yeah, Yeah.

451
00:21:41,468 --> 00:21:42,468
We need to cover this up

452
00:21:42,469 --> 00:21:44,069
and make a pact to go silent.

453
00:21:44,070 --> 00:21:45,610
Kamal: What?

454
00:21:45,605 --> 00:21:46,605
Drew: We seal the box back up.

455
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:48,236
Pretend like we saw nothing.

456
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:49,780
You know, just like you said.

457
00:21:49,776 --> 00:21:51,006
Kamal: I didn't say that.

458
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,210
Drew: It's perfect.

459
00:21:52,211 --> 00:21:53,911
You know, this way
Lance will never know

460
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:56,123
that I know and then
I still get the job.

461
00:21:56,115 --> 00:22:02,015
Yeah. We just need
to find some tape.

462
00:22:02,021 --> 00:22:07,691
(ominous music)

463
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:09,434
Drew: We need to figure
out another plan.

464
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:10,629
Kamal: No. I need to leave

465
00:22:10,630 --> 00:22:12,530
and you need to call the cops.

466
00:22:12,532 --> 00:22:14,072
Drew: I can't screw
Lance over like that.

467
00:22:14,066 --> 00:22:17,336
Kamal: What if Lance isn't
as legit a guy as you think.

468
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:18,366
I mean, think about it.

469
00:22:18,371 --> 00:22:19,611
Why does he pick you?

470
00:22:19,606 --> 00:22:21,306
Some furniture store
clerk to watch his house.

471
00:22:21,307 --> 00:22:22,937
And why on the weekend when he's

472
00:22:22,942 --> 00:22:25,182
expecting something important

473
00:22:25,177 --> 00:22:26,247
does he decide to get
up and leave town?

474
00:22:26,245 --> 00:22:28,715
Drew: You're not
seriously suggesting

475
00:22:28,715 --> 00:22:30,375
that I'm part of some?

476
00:22:30,383 --> 00:22:31,783
Kamal: Conspiracy?

477
00:22:31,784 --> 00:22:32,994
Kamal: I don't know,

478
00:22:32,985 --> 00:22:34,945
but it's hard to ignore
the fucking facts.

479
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:36,894
Drew: Oh hang on. Hang on.

480
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:39,289
There are three basic
principles to success.

481
00:22:39,291 --> 00:22:44,361
Okay, okay, okay.
Number one. Reason.

482
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,633
Number two. Focus. Nmber three

483
00:22:46,633 --> 00:22:47,873
Kamal: Go fuck yourself.

484
00:22:47,867 --> 00:22:49,167
Drew: Effort. Okay?

485
00:22:49,168 --> 00:22:51,368
We follow Lance Bryant's
book and we'll be fine.

486
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:52,870
Drew: Number one. Reason.

487
00:22:52,872 --> 00:22:54,412
Make an informed choice.

488
00:22:54,407 --> 00:22:56,537
It's not how to use your
mother fucking time.

489
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,783
It's how to use it the best
mother fucking way possible.

490
00:22:58,778 --> 00:23:08,048
Drew: Yeah? Okay. Okay.
So based on our situation

491
00:23:08,054 --> 00:23:10,794
we need to go get a
new box for her. Yeah?

492
00:23:10,790 --> 00:23:13,990
It's crazy, we're already
a third of the way done.

493
00:23:13,993 --> 00:23:15,803
Kamal: Have you even
read that book man?

494
00:23:15,795 --> 00:23:17,025
Drew: Okay. Let's
do it. I'll drive.

495
00:23:18,364 --> 00:23:21,674
Shit! Hey Marta.

496
00:23:21,668 --> 00:23:24,438
Marta: Mr. Drew I
clean master suite now.

497
00:23:24,437 --> 00:23:27,607
Drew: Actually can you
clean it later? Maybe?

498
00:23:27,607 --> 00:23:29,137
Just a little bit later.

499
00:23:29,141 --> 00:23:30,781
Like maybe in two hours.

500
00:23:30,777 --> 00:23:31,907
Marta: No, Mr. Lance
will not be happy

501
00:23:31,911 --> 00:23:33,781
if I don't clean
master suite now.

502
00:23:33,780 --> 00:23:35,080
Drew: Right now. I get that

503
00:23:35,081 --> 00:23:36,721
and you can totally clean it.

504
00:23:36,716 --> 00:23:38,986
Just not, just not
right now, you know,

505
00:23:38,985 --> 00:23:40,945
so maybe you can go
clean something else

506
00:23:40,953 --> 00:23:42,193
for a while and then come back.

507
00:23:42,188 --> 00:23:43,418
Marta: I must clean now.

508
00:23:45,958 --> 00:23:48,698
Marta: No-no. It's not
on your time. Okay?

509
00:23:48,695 --> 00:23:52,665
Marta: (speaking in Spanish)

510
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:54,365
Drew: I don't speak
Spanish Marta.

511
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:55,966
That's not the [unintelligible]

512
00:23:55,968 --> 00:23:57,868
Five minutes?

513
00:23:57,870 --> 00:23:59,410
Can you go clean something
else for a while?

514
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:00,465
And then come ...

515
00:24:00,473 --> 00:24:02,643
Kamal: It's cool.
We're finished.

516
00:24:08,481 --> 00:24:11,281
Drew: Uh yeah. We're finished.

517
00:24:11,283 --> 00:24:13,923
Marta: (mumbles in Spanish)

518
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:15,790
Drew: What the fuck
[unintelligible]

519
00:24:15,788 --> 00:24:17,388
Kamal: Follow me.

520
00:24:17,389 --> 00:24:23,229
Marta: (grumbling in Spanish)

521
00:24:23,930 --> 00:24:25,360
Kamal: I had to act fast.

522
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:29,774
I'm thinking we should find
a better place for her.

523
00:24:29,769 --> 00:24:31,399
Somewhere out of the sun.

524
00:24:31,403 --> 00:24:33,373
Drew: Yeah.

525
00:24:33,372 --> 00:24:36,442
Kamal: Don't you want to
know how I got her out here?

526
00:24:36,442 --> 00:24:38,882
Drew: No.

527
00:24:38,878 --> 00:24:49,018
(Music)

528
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:59,031
(Music)

529
00:25:34,500 --> 00:25:43,040
Girl Scouts: Wanna
buy some cookies?

530
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,582
Drew: What did you
say little girls?

531
00:25:44,577 --> 00:25:47,947
Girl Scouts: Wanna
buy some cookies?

532
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:51,817
Drew: Uh, sure,
yeah, yeah, yeah.

533
00:25:51,818 --> 00:25:53,588
I'd love to buy some cookies.

534
00:25:54,086 --> 00:25:58,116
Um, wow. Okay, great, um,

535
00:25:58,124 --> 00:26:05,404
I'll take them all. So that's -

536
00:26:05,397 --> 00:26:09,537
Okay. So here you go.

537
00:26:09,535 --> 00:26:13,905
That's for you. Okay thank you.

538
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:20,183
Great. Uh, thank you.

539
00:26:20,179 --> 00:26:21,909
Kamal: Experiment in college.

540
00:26:21,914 --> 00:26:26,854
I didn't get two.

541
00:26:30,389 --> 00:26:38,799
(garage door closes)

542
00:26:38,798 --> 00:26:44,898
(Marta thumping mat)

543
00:26:44,904 --> 00:26:46,414
Kamal: How long do
we have to wait?

544
00:26:46,405 --> 00:26:48,535
Drew: Until she's gone, I guess.

545
00:26:48,540 --> 00:27:00,720
Kamal: Well then, I'm
going to have a beer.

546
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:04,820
Kamal: Not even a little
something to take the edge off?

547
00:27:04,824 --> 00:27:06,434
(thumping)

548
00:27:06,425 --> 00:27:07,885
Drew: I've got work to do man.

549
00:27:07,894 --> 00:27:10,134
Kamal: I think we've
earned one drink.

550
00:27:10,129 --> 00:27:15,369
(thumping)

551
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:22,467
Drew: Yeah okay. This is it.

552
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:32,624
(Rock music)

553
00:27:32,618 --> 00:27:42,628
(Rock music)

554
00:27:52,905 --> 00:28:03,115
(somber music)

555
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:13,125
(somber music)

556
00:28:20,733 --> 00:28:29,213
Drew: Kamal? Kamal?

557
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:43,088
(somber music)

558
00:28:43,089 --> 00:28:48,489
Drew: (alarm goes off)

559
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:58,644
(beeping - alarm squealing)

560
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:08,707
(beeping - alarm squealing)

561
00:29:15,922 --> 00:29:23,762
(alarm stops - phone ringing)

562
00:29:23,762 --> 00:29:27,702
Kamal's voice: You've
reached Kamal with SlicePro!

563
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:29,439
Leave a message. (Beep)

564
00:29:29,435 --> 00:29:32,535
Drew: Yeah. Hi Kamal. It's Drew.

565
00:29:32,538 --> 00:29:36,038
Drew DeLaney. Do
you remember me?

566
00:29:36,042 --> 00:29:40,482
Uh, you were here at
Lance Bryant's house.

567
00:29:40,479 --> 00:29:42,209
Yeah, you were going to help me

568
00:29:42,214 --> 00:29:43,884
with an extremely
unfortunate situation

569
00:29:43,883 --> 00:29:45,083
we found ourselves in.

570
00:29:45,084 --> 00:29:46,794
You remember that?

571
00:29:46,785 --> 00:29:48,855
Uh, well, I just wanted to call

572
00:29:48,855 --> 00:29:50,085
and say thanks for nothing.

573
00:29:50,089 --> 00:29:52,619
Yeah. I'm not sure
if you've heard,

574
00:29:52,624 --> 00:29:55,634
but, friends don't ditch
friends. (doorbell ringing)

575
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:57,757
Not how it works.
(doorbell ringing)

576
00:29:57,763 --> 00:30:01,203
So, good luck with your
crappy job (knocking)

577
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:04,040
selling crappy knives to crappy
people (doorbell ringing)

578
00:30:04,036 --> 00:30:07,006
that I'm sure I'll be stuck
doing something equally crappy

579
00:30:07,006 --> 00:30:08,666
since you left me high
and dry with this.

580
00:30:08,674 --> 00:30:10,744
Uh, hope to never see
you around again Ass.

581
00:30:10,742 --> 00:30:17,382
Okay, best wishes, Bye.
(doorbell ringing)

582
00:30:17,383 --> 00:30:18,683
Drew: Uh!

583
00:30:18,684 --> 00:30:19,994
Barry: Mr. Bryant?

584
00:30:19,986 --> 00:30:21,116
Drew: Uh, well I'm ...

585
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:22,420
Barry: Vault Home Security.

586
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:24,961
Drew: Uh, great.
Look, I think I ...

587
00:30:24,957 --> 00:30:27,087
Barry: Is everything
all right in there?

588
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:28,563
Your panic alarm was triggered.

589
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,160
Drew: Yeah, and everything
is fine. Thank you.

590
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:33,673
Barry: Mind if I take
a quick poke around?

591
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:36,695
Drew: Well yes, it's not
really the best time.

592
00:30:36,702 --> 00:30:38,442
You know, it's fine.

593
00:30:38,437 --> 00:30:41,167
I mean, I'm pretty sure
I set it off myself,

594
00:30:41,173 --> 00:30:42,373
so nothing to worry about.

595
00:30:42,374 --> 00:30:43,884
Barry: Quite possible sir,

596
00:30:43,876 --> 00:30:46,106
but better safe than sorry.

597
00:30:46,112 --> 00:30:51,122
That's the Vault
Home Security motto.

598
00:30:51,117 --> 00:30:52,777
Drew: I understand
it's your job,

599
00:30:52,784 --> 00:30:53,854
but this is completely
unnecessary.

600
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:55,962
Barry: Unnecessary?

601
00:30:55,955 --> 00:30:58,415
The sudden power loss
55 and a half seconds

602
00:30:58,424 --> 00:31:00,394
after the alarm was
triggered suggests

603
00:31:00,392 --> 00:31:02,902
that the intruder cut
the power from your home.

604
00:31:02,895 --> 00:31:06,925
Now, this is your
home. Correct sir?

605
00:31:06,933 --> 00:31:08,703
Drew: That's what I've
been trying to tell you.

606
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:10,640
Barry: Now you
wouldn't want your home

607
00:31:10,636 --> 00:31:13,936
invaded and you BTK'd
while you slept.

608
00:31:13,940 --> 00:31:15,240
Would you?

609
00:31:15,241 --> 00:31:17,011
Drew: BTK'd?

610
00:31:17,009 --> 00:31:20,109
Barry: Bind, Torture, Kill.

611
00:31:20,112 --> 00:31:21,652
Now is that what you want sir?

612
00:31:21,647 --> 00:31:23,447
Because if that is what you want

613
00:31:23,449 --> 00:31:27,489
then I'll pack up my
stuff and I'll go.

614
00:31:27,486 --> 00:31:30,116
Didn't think so.

615
00:31:30,122 --> 00:31:31,492
Now, if you'll let me continue

616
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:32,790
until everything is clear

617
00:31:32,791 --> 00:31:38,001
I'll be out of your hair
in no time. (trips) Sheez!

618
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:49,307
(garage door opening)

619
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:51,138
Drew: I think everything
is fine really.

620
00:31:51,143 --> 00:31:52,913
Barry: Shhh.

621
00:31:52,911 --> 00:31:55,681
They like to hide in garages.

622
00:31:55,681 --> 00:31:57,951
Drew: Who likes to
hide in garages?

623
00:31:57,950 --> 00:31:58,920
Barry: I don't want to impart

624
00:31:58,917 --> 00:32:00,587
that dark knowledge onto you.

625
00:32:00,586 --> 00:32:03,186
Unless you never
want to sleep again.

626
00:32:03,189 --> 00:32:13,329
(ominous music)

627
00:32:13,332 --> 00:32:24,682
(ominous music)

628
00:32:24,676 --> 00:32:28,146
Barry: Holy shoot!

629
00:32:28,147 --> 00:32:29,677
Is this yours sir?

630
00:32:29,681 --> 00:32:31,421
Drew: Listen man
it's a long story.

631
00:32:31,417 --> 00:32:33,517
Barry: If this is yours,

632
00:32:33,519 --> 00:32:36,189
then I'd like to
shake your hand.

633
00:32:36,188 --> 00:32:39,358
I tell you I'm a
sucker for these

634
00:32:39,358 --> 00:32:41,988
old vintage photo booths.

635
00:32:41,994 --> 00:32:45,664
When I said sucker I mean
"obsessive freak." (laughs)

636
00:32:45,664 --> 00:32:48,734
Yeah, Jerry and I, we always
say if we win the lotto

637
00:32:48,734 --> 00:32:51,544
we're going to go on a
road trip and we're going

638
00:32:51,537 --> 00:32:54,667
to find 50 of these from every
state in God's good nation.

639
00:32:54,673 --> 00:32:57,313
Drew: Sounds cool,
yeah. Who's Jerry?

640
00:32:57,309 --> 00:32:59,079
Barry: Jerry? My brother.

641
00:32:59,078 --> 00:33:00,748
You know, he works
the nightshift.

642
00:33:00,746 --> 00:33:02,106
Drew: Of course, yeah.

643
00:33:02,114 --> 00:33:03,354
Barry: Oh come on. You've
got to have seen Jerry.

644
00:33:03,349 --> 00:33:07,349
People say we look a lot
alike, which we don't.

645
00:33:07,353 --> 00:33:09,493
I'm easier on the eyes. (laughs)

646
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,588
Yeah, it's always been
a dream, you know.

647
00:33:11,590 --> 00:33:12,590
To have 50 of these
lovely ladies.

648
00:33:12,591 --> 00:33:13,861
Clean them up, you know,

649
00:33:13,859 --> 00:33:15,559
make them something real nice.

650
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:17,501
Drew: Yeah, got to have dreams.

651
00:33:17,496 --> 00:33:19,126
Barry: Oh yeah.

652
00:33:19,131 --> 00:33:23,701
Say, you're looking
to sell this baby?

653
00:33:23,702 --> 00:33:24,872
Drew: NO! NO!

654
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:29,535
Barry: Geez louise!

655
00:33:29,541 --> 00:33:33,581
Yeah, I get it. It's a beaut.

656
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:37,319
No reason to sell,
but no reason to yell.

657
00:33:39,951 --> 00:33:43,591
Yeah. Could use a
little scrub though.

658
00:33:43,589 --> 00:33:44,819
Drew: Yeah.

659
00:33:44,823 --> 00:33:53,203
Drew: What? Oh yeah, those
are just some friends

660
00:33:53,199 --> 00:33:57,799
that's consensual
everyone's kind of

661
00:33:57,803 --> 00:34:00,573
[unintelligible] before
handabout the parameters

662
00:34:00,572 --> 00:34:01,512
of [unintelligible]

663
00:34:01,507 --> 00:34:02,837
Barry: All right sir.

664
00:34:02,841 --> 00:34:05,711
The garage appears to be clear.

665
00:34:05,711 --> 00:34:09,581
Drew: Good, uh, great, uh,

666
00:34:09,581 --> 00:34:13,991
so thank you for securing it.

667
00:34:13,985 --> 00:34:17,115
Barry: It's my job

668
00:34:17,123 --> 00:34:19,563
and I know you might feel safe,

669
00:34:19,558 --> 00:34:23,128
but remember if a sick
psycho wants to get inside

670
00:34:23,129 --> 00:34:28,369
he can if he really wants to.

671
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:32,997
(trips) (laughs) Whoa!
That was a close one.

672
00:34:33,004 --> 00:34:36,114
I tell you, sir, if I had a
dime for every time I (falls)

673
00:34:36,108 --> 00:34:40,278
Drew: Shit man!
Oh God. You okay?

674
00:34:40,279 --> 00:34:43,279
(sighs) You just got the
wind knocked out of you

675
00:34:43,282 --> 00:34:46,352
that makes you kind of -

676
00:34:46,352 --> 00:34:56,562
(leaking sound - ominous music)

677
00:34:56,562 --> 00:35:11,282
Drew: Oh! Oh! Oh! No!

678
00:35:11,277 --> 00:35:12,577
(phone ringing)

679
00:35:12,578 --> 00:35:16,008
Kamal's voice: You've
reached Kamal with SlicePro.

680
00:35:16,014 --> 00:35:17,224
Leave a message. (Beep)

681
00:35:17,216 --> 00:35:19,716
Drew: Hey again, Kamal.
Sorry to bother you,

682
00:35:19,718 --> 00:35:23,018
but listen we have
a problem here.

683
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:25,391
Um, rather a second problem.

684
00:35:25,391 --> 00:35:28,791
Um, actually the first
one is completely missing,

685
00:35:28,794 --> 00:35:30,734
you know, so maybe
we only have one

686
00:35:30,729 --> 00:35:33,469
to deal with now, that
would be good. Right?

687
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:36,495
Or maybe not. Um,
anyway I'm not, uh,

688
00:35:36,502 --> 00:35:38,502
not really sure what to do here

689
00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:46,984
so just call me back
please. Oh my God!

690
00:35:46,978 --> 00:35:51,778
(ominous music)

691
00:35:51,783 --> 00:35:58,893
(dog bell tinkling)

692
00:36:05,197 --> 00:36:07,967
(footsteps)

693
00:36:07,966 --> 00:36:18,106
(ominous music)

694
00:36:18,109 --> 00:36:28,119
(ominous music)

695
00:36:56,415 --> 00:36:58,915
Allan: Lance Bryant?

696
00:36:58,917 --> 00:37:04,957
Drew: Whoa! (coughs) Holy shit.

697
00:37:04,956 --> 00:37:07,056
Allan: Lance Bryant?

698
00:37:07,058 --> 00:37:10,398
It is a pleasure to
make your acquaintance.

699
00:37:10,396 --> 00:37:13,866
Drew: Yeah, that's great, uh,

700
00:37:13,865 --> 00:37:15,795
but I'm not, I'm not Lance.

701
00:37:15,801 --> 00:37:18,071
Allan: You're not Lance Bryant?

702
00:37:18,069 --> 00:37:20,039
Drew: No.

703
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:21,238
Allan: This is what
you're telling me.

704
00:37:21,239 --> 00:37:27,009
Drew: Look, this, this
is Lance, this picture

705
00:37:27,012 --> 00:37:29,722
it's the guy with
the horse head on.

706
00:37:29,715 --> 00:37:32,015
I'm pretty sure
that's his torso.

707
00:37:32,017 --> 00:37:35,847
I don't why the
(breathing heavy) yeah.

708
00:37:35,854 --> 00:37:38,164
My name is Drew.

709
00:37:38,156 --> 00:37:39,686
I'm just kind of
taking care of things

710
00:37:39,691 --> 00:37:41,531
while he's out of town.

711
00:37:41,527 --> 00:37:42,857
Allan: You haven't seen or heard

712
00:37:42,861 --> 00:37:46,671
anything about, uh,
a girl. Have you?

713
00:37:46,665 --> 00:37:50,695
Drew: Uh?

714
00:37:50,702 --> 00:37:53,672
Allan: A young girl who
may or may not have been

715
00:37:53,672 --> 00:37:55,872
here in one form or another.

716
00:37:55,874 --> 00:37:57,844
Drew: Wait a
second. Who are you?

717
00:37:57,843 --> 00:37:59,813
And why, why are you here?

718
00:37:59,811 --> 00:38:04,251
Allan: Who I am
is not important.

719
00:38:04,249 --> 00:38:06,549
How I got in here is
even less important.

720
00:38:06,552 --> 00:38:10,122
What is important is
that a very important man

721
00:38:10,121 --> 00:38:13,491
is looking for his very
important granddaughter

722
00:38:13,492 --> 00:38:16,462
who he believes Lance Bryant

723
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:19,672
has been in contact with.

724
00:38:19,665 --> 00:38:22,765
Drew: Well, um, yeah I don't,

725
00:38:22,768 --> 00:38:24,768
I don't know anything
about a granddaughter.

726
00:38:24,770 --> 00:38:28,570
Allan: If she, or Lance Bryant,
come by while you're here

727
00:38:28,574 --> 00:38:31,884
this very important
man that I speak of

728
00:38:31,877 --> 00:38:34,947
would see to it that
you're handsomely rewarded.

729
00:38:34,946 --> 00:38:38,216
If you would provide him
with helpful information.

730
00:38:38,216 --> 00:38:42,946
Use this to do so.

731
00:38:42,954 --> 00:38:45,724
Drew: Plateau Pines
Retirement Community.

732
00:38:45,724 --> 00:38:48,034
Allan: He will make you an offer

733
00:38:48,026 --> 00:38:54,326
you will not excuse, refuse.

734
00:38:54,332 --> 00:39:04,682
He will make you an offer
you will not refuse.

735
00:39:06,478 --> 00:39:08,478
Vik: Well?

736
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:10,820
Allan: Your granddaughter
isn't in there.

737
00:39:10,816 --> 00:39:13,986
Lance Bryant isn't in there.

738
00:39:13,985 --> 00:39:15,385
Vik: What do you mean?

739
00:39:15,387 --> 00:39:16,347
Lance Bryant wasn't in there?

740
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:18,424
Allan: Some other guy was,

741
00:39:18,424 --> 00:39:23,834
Drew something. He said
Lance Bryant is out of town.

742
00:39:23,829 --> 00:39:28,669
This is Lance Bryant.

743
00:39:28,667 --> 00:39:31,197
Vik: I hate to think what that

744
00:39:31,202 --> 00:39:35,942
deviant would do
with my Katrina.

745
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:39,481
All right, all right,
we'll, we'll wait.

746
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:41,678
We'll sit here and
wait for my Katrina

747
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:45,220
or for that sick son
of a bitch to show up.

748
00:39:45,216 --> 00:39:48,446
Even if it takes all night.

749
00:39:48,454 --> 00:39:51,824
Allan: Boss, I got to have
the fun bus back by three.

750
00:39:51,823 --> 00:39:54,033
Vik: Oh all right, all right,

751
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:56,725
Jesus Christ let's take it back.

752
00:39:56,728 --> 00:39:58,828
We'll come back after
dark. All right?

753
00:39:58,830 --> 00:40:02,030
Let's get moving.
Let's get moving.

754
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:05,243
Traffic is going to be a cunt.

755
00:40:05,236 --> 00:40:09,836
(drives away)

756
00:40:09,841 --> 00:40:23,921
Kamal: Drew! Drew! I'm back.

757
00:40:29,294 --> 00:40:31,104
Kamal: What the fuck?

758
00:40:31,096 --> 00:40:33,466
Why did you put her in there?

759
00:40:33,465 --> 00:40:44,735
Drew: I wish I had. It
would make more sense.

760
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:49,208
(dog barking)

761
00:40:53,451 --> 00:40:56,591
Kamal: I guess it
could be worse.

762
00:40:56,588 --> 00:41:03,898
(open shed door - ominous music)

763
00:41:03,895 --> 00:41:06,155
Kamal: Should have
thought of this sooner.

764
00:41:06,164 --> 00:41:10,244
We should call the cops.

765
00:41:10,235 --> 00:41:11,195
Drew: Are you crazy?

766
00:41:11,202 --> 00:41:13,172
Did you see the guy in the shed?

767
00:41:13,171 --> 00:41:16,611
Kamal: Yeah, and that
was an accident. Right?

768
00:41:16,608 --> 00:41:17,608
Drew: Yeah.

769
00:41:17,609 --> 00:41:19,439
Kamal: Then what's the problem?

770
00:41:19,444 --> 00:41:21,384
Drew: You know maybe
if you were here

771
00:41:21,379 --> 00:41:22,849
instead of out selling knives

772
00:41:22,848 --> 00:41:24,178
on your little bicycle

773
00:41:24,182 --> 00:41:25,852
you might have
seen what happened.

774
00:41:25,851 --> 00:41:27,451
Kamal: Well, take it easy man.

775
00:41:27,452 --> 00:41:29,492
I was trying to
solve the problem

776
00:41:29,487 --> 00:41:31,257
that we discussed last night

777
00:41:31,256 --> 00:41:33,486
or were you too blacked
out to remember?

778
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:35,561
Drew: No, I had like four beers.

779
00:41:35,561 --> 00:41:37,161
I wasn't blacked out.

780
00:41:37,162 --> 00:41:38,432
Kamal: Four beers, right.

781
00:41:38,429 --> 00:41:39,729
Drew: Yeah four beers.

782
00:41:39,731 --> 00:41:42,131
Kamal: Uh-hum, you
had four more beers

783
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:43,773
and then you had
four more beers.

784
00:41:43,769 --> 00:41:44,939
Drew: Nope.

785
00:41:44,936 --> 00:41:46,466
Kamal: And then you
had all those shots

786
00:41:46,471 --> 00:41:48,771
to go with each and
every one of those beers.

787
00:41:48,774 --> 00:41:50,744
Drew: I think, I think,
I think I remember.

788
00:41:50,742 --> 00:41:52,542
(phone ringing)

789
00:41:52,544 --> 00:42:00,194
Kamal: Yep. Uh yeah.
Yes sir. Uh, one second.

790
00:42:03,054 --> 00:42:05,394
Drew: Hello.

791
00:42:05,390 --> 00:42:08,260
Spencer: Drew. Who
the fuck was that?

792
00:42:08,259 --> 00:42:10,559
Drew: Uh, hey Mr. Bryant, Lance.

793
00:42:10,562 --> 00:42:12,762
It was, it was no one.

794
00:42:12,764 --> 00:42:16,974
Lance: What the fuck
you mean? No one?

795
00:42:16,968 --> 00:42:17,998
Don't fuck with me.

796
00:42:18,003 --> 00:42:20,243
Who the fuck is in my house?

797
00:42:20,238 --> 00:42:21,868
Drew: It's no big deal,

798
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:23,643
just some door-to-door
knife salesman.

799
00:42:23,642 --> 00:42:25,642
Kamal: Junior sales associate.

800
00:42:25,644 --> 00:42:26,914
Spence: You know what?

801
00:42:26,912 --> 00:42:29,012
Go get the pellet gun
and shoot that bitch.

802
00:42:29,014 --> 00:42:30,754
Drew: I don't know Lance.

803
00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:33,619
He seems like a
good guy, you know.

804
00:42:33,619 --> 00:42:35,549
Lance: Of course he
seems like a good guy.

805
00:42:35,553 --> 00:42:37,623
Bitch probably works
on 100% commission.

806
00:42:37,623 --> 00:42:40,693
Get the pellet gun
and shoot his ass.

807
00:42:40,692 --> 00:42:41,862
Drew: You know what?

808
00:42:41,860 --> 00:42:44,160
I think he's actually leaving.

809
00:42:44,162 --> 00:42:47,672
Um, so yeah, I wouldn't
want to waste a pellet.

810
00:42:47,666 --> 00:42:49,636
So nothing to worry about.

811
00:42:49,635 --> 00:42:51,265
Spencer: No, no, no,
it's not all good.

812
00:42:51,269 --> 00:42:52,999
Success suckers need
to learn a lesson.

813
00:42:53,004 --> 00:42:59,914
Shoot him. Damn it!
Shoot his ass now Drew.

814
00:42:59,911 --> 00:43:05,681
Drew: (shoots Kamal)

815
00:43:05,684 --> 00:43:09,394
Spencer: There
you go. Good work!

816
00:43:09,387 --> 00:43:13,057
Now listen. That hot little
package come for me yet?

817
00:43:13,058 --> 00:43:14,528
Drew: Uh, no.

818
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:15,885
Spencer: Damn.

819
00:43:15,894 --> 00:43:17,434
Might have slipped by
with everything else

820
00:43:17,428 --> 00:43:19,158
that shows up at the house.

821
00:43:19,164 --> 00:43:20,604
Drew: No, no. I'm pretty sure

822
00:43:20,598 --> 00:43:22,398
we would have noticed
something that special.

823
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,200
Spencer: We? Who the fuck is we?

824
00:43:25,203 --> 00:43:30,043
Drew: Uh, me and Mr.
Baldwin, you know.

825
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:32,241
The only two people here.

826
00:43:32,243 --> 00:43:34,713
Spencer: Mr. Baldwin
is not a person Drew.

827
00:43:34,713 --> 00:43:37,323
Drew: Yes sir. Mr.
Baldwin is not a person.

828
00:43:37,315 --> 00:43:39,275
Spencer: Listen, you just
keep your eye out. OK?

829
00:43:39,284 --> 00:43:40,824
And if she shows up

830
00:43:40,819 --> 00:43:43,789
you just toss her
in the master suite.

831
00:43:43,789 --> 00:43:46,589
Hell, for that matter,
even in the garage is fine.

832
00:43:46,591 --> 00:43:49,531
Ha, you know, she can't
complain. (laughs)

833
00:43:49,527 --> 00:43:51,397
Anyway, I am about to go

834
00:43:51,396 --> 00:43:53,096
and get my wine tasting on Drew.

835
00:43:53,098 --> 00:43:57,198
I will talk to you tomorrow.

836
00:43:57,202 --> 00:44:05,982
(ominous music)

837
00:44:05,977 --> 00:44:07,947
Drew: What the fuck
are we going to do?

838
00:44:07,946 --> 00:44:10,646
Kamal: Lucky you didn't
break the skin asshole.

839
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,578
Drew: We need to
[unintelligible]

840
00:44:12,583 --> 00:44:14,123
Kamal: I need to pull
up my ass out of here

841
00:44:14,119 --> 00:44:21,059
before you shoot me again
you fucking lunatic.

842
00:44:21,059 --> 00:44:22,859
Pretty good. Huh?

843
00:44:22,861 --> 00:44:25,101
Lance doesn't know what the
original box looks like.

844
00:44:25,096 --> 00:44:27,196
She could have come in
these styrofoam coolers

845
00:44:27,198 --> 00:44:28,928
just as easily as
the cardboard box.

846
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:35,440
Drew: Okay, there's no way she's
fitting in one of these things.

847
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,140
Kamal: Yeah, but
she'll fit in both.

848
00:44:39,144 --> 00:44:40,414
I know you weren't impressed

849
00:44:40,411 --> 00:44:42,581
by my SlicePro demonstration,

850
00:44:42,580 --> 00:44:44,350
but trust me the
blades are legit.

851
00:44:44,349 --> 00:44:45,819
By my calculations
it will take, like,

852
00:44:45,817 --> 00:44:48,087
5 to 10 minutes to
completely slice her body.

853
00:44:48,086 --> 00:44:53,416
Drew: Okay, Okay, Okay.
I get it. I get it.

854
00:44:53,424 --> 00:44:55,934
Yeah, and that's exactly
what we shouldn't do.

855
00:44:55,927 --> 00:44:57,227
Kamal: Why not?

856
00:44:57,228 --> 00:44:58,458
If we don't do something

857
00:44:58,463 --> 00:45:00,703
we're the ones who are
going to be fucked.

858
00:45:00,698 --> 00:45:02,528
Drew: No Lance, Lance
won't let that happen.

859
00:45:02,533 --> 00:45:05,003
Not if we, not if we
take care of this,

860
00:45:05,003 --> 00:45:07,173
like, rationale and
civilized human beings.

861
00:45:07,172 --> 00:45:08,442
Not like this.

862
00:45:08,439 --> 00:45:11,509
Kamal: Drew, Lance doesn't
give a fuck about you.

863
00:45:11,509 --> 00:45:14,179
Drew: Okay, Okay.
Number two. Focus.

864
00:45:14,179 --> 00:45:16,379
Okay. Aim for
something specific.

865
00:45:16,381 --> 00:45:19,251
Impatience is the forerunner
of mother fuckin' failure.

866
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:21,720
(closes book)

867
00:45:21,719 --> 00:45:23,989
Drew: These coolers
are an impatient move.

868
00:45:23,989 --> 00:45:26,989
Okay? So, so we'll get
her back into the garage

869
00:45:26,992 --> 00:45:29,492
and together we'll go find
something that actually works.

870
00:45:29,494 --> 00:45:31,264
Kamal: I'm telling you man.

871
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:33,402
A box that size that
isn't already filled

872
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:35,328
with a refrigerator
or a water heater

873
00:45:35,333 --> 00:45:37,843
is impossible to find.

874
00:45:37,836 --> 00:45:39,266
Drew: You probably didn't check

875
00:45:39,270 --> 00:45:43,070
a furniture store. Did you?

876
00:45:43,074 --> 00:45:44,944
I'm not saying it's
your fault, or anything,

877
00:45:44,943 --> 00:45:47,053
it's just, it just
takes a certain mindset

878
00:45:47,045 --> 00:45:49,975
to achieve success.

879
00:45:49,981 --> 00:45:53,891
Kamal: What the fuck is
that supposed to mean?

880
00:45:53,885 --> 00:45:56,785
Drew: Well it means
like back in school,

881
00:45:56,788 --> 00:45:58,818
for example, you
know, you typically

882
00:45:58,824 --> 00:46:01,464
settled for the easiest
way out of things.

883
00:46:01,459 --> 00:46:03,359
You know, I mean,
you transferred.

884
00:46:03,361 --> 00:46:07,001
Things got difficult
and you transferred

885
00:46:06,998 --> 00:46:08,168
and I'm not saying
it's your fault.

886
00:46:08,166 --> 00:46:10,366
It's just, it's just
the way you're wired.

887
00:46:10,368 --> 00:46:12,438
Kamal: The way I'm wired?

888
00:46:12,437 --> 00:46:16,307
What about you man?

889
00:46:16,307 --> 00:46:20,547
What about you jumping
ship on your fucking job?

890
00:46:20,545 --> 00:46:26,985
You don't fucking
get it. Do you?

891
00:46:26,985 --> 00:46:30,615
Fuck you man.

892
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,421
This is your fucking problem.

893
00:46:32,423 --> 00:46:36,793
Drew: Seriously? Oh my God.

894
00:46:36,794 --> 00:46:46,944
(Music)

895
00:46:46,938 --> 00:46:56,948
(Music)

896
00:47:07,492 --> 00:47:14,172
(car doors shut)

897
00:47:14,165 --> 00:47:20,705
(footsteps)

898
00:47:20,705 --> 00:47:23,035
(knocking)

899
00:47:23,041 --> 00:47:33,751
(Music)

900
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:36,591
(knocking)

901
00:47:36,587 --> 00:47:39,487
(Music)

902
00:47:39,490 --> 00:47:44,530
Drew: (grunting)

903
00:47:44,529 --> 00:47:48,229
Katie: DREW!

904
00:47:48,233 --> 00:47:56,243
(Music)

905
00:47:56,241 --> 00:47:58,181
Katie: Drew!

906
00:47:58,176 --> 00:48:04,976
(Music)

907
00:48:04,983 --> 00:48:09,653
Drew: (sighs)
[unintelligible] (sighs)

908
00:48:09,654 --> 00:48:19,804
(Music)

909
00:48:19,797 --> 00:48:30,737
(Music)

910
00:48:30,741 --> 00:48:34,651
Katie: What the fuck?

911
00:48:34,645 --> 00:48:38,645
(Music)

912
00:48:38,649 --> 00:48:42,949
(plunk)

913
00:48:42,954 --> 00:48:50,234
(shuts car door - squish)

914
00:48:50,228 --> 00:48:53,798
(knocking)

915
00:48:53,798 --> 00:48:55,968
Kamal: Oh hey, you're a ...

916
00:48:55,967 --> 00:48:57,067
Spencer: Spencer Shaw.

917
00:48:57,068 --> 00:48:58,598
Spencer: That's right.
We met earlier.

918
00:48:58,603 --> 00:49:00,113
Spencer: Yes, and you're
one of the young gentlemen

919
00:49:00,105 --> 00:49:01,405
that's house sitting for Lance.

920
00:49:01,406 --> 00:49:02,466
Is that right?

921
00:49:02,473 --> 00:49:03,743
Kamal: Oh no. I'm
not house sitting.

922
00:49:03,741 --> 00:49:05,081
I'm never house
sitting over there.

923
00:49:05,076 --> 00:49:06,576
Spencer: That's right,
of course, of course.

924
00:49:06,577 --> 00:49:08,977
Then it was your friend
that's watching his place?

925
00:49:08,980 --> 00:49:10,980
Kamal: Look, Drew
is not my friend.

926
00:49:10,982 --> 00:49:15,252
Spencer: Really? I wasn't
under that impression.

927
00:49:15,253 --> 00:49:17,863
I thought the two of
you were peas in a pod.

928
00:49:17,855 --> 00:49:19,955
Kamal: No, we never were.

929
00:49:19,957 --> 00:49:23,157
Spence: Well then,
what brings you by ...

930
00:49:23,161 --> 00:49:24,101
Kamal: Kamal.

931
00:49:24,095 --> 00:49:25,955
Spencer: Kamal. Excellent name.

932
00:49:25,963 --> 00:49:32,903
Kamal with a K. Uh,
[unintelligible] yes,

933
00:49:32,903 --> 00:49:35,013
Those who tribal
among the mountains

934
00:49:35,006 --> 00:49:37,176
see themselves
within themselves.

935
00:49:37,175 --> 00:49:42,745
What brings you by
Kamal? A box. (laughs)

936
00:49:49,454 --> 00:49:53,594
Drew: What the fuck
am I going to do?

937
00:49:53,591 --> 00:50:01,201
(phone ringing)

938
00:50:01,199 --> 00:50:03,529
Drew: (breathing heavy)

939
00:50:03,534 --> 00:50:06,004
Katie: So, you'll
invite other girls

940
00:50:06,003 --> 00:50:08,173
to this swanky ass
pad you're watching,

941
00:50:08,173 --> 00:50:10,683
but not your own
girlfriend. Huh?

942
00:50:10,675 --> 00:50:12,005
Drew: What are
you talking about?

943
00:50:12,009 --> 00:50:13,879
Katie: Who the fuck is she dude?

944
00:50:13,878 --> 00:50:15,148
Drew: Who's who?

945
00:50:15,146 --> 00:50:17,446
Katie: The geisha
slutty anorexic slut

946
00:50:17,448 --> 00:50:18,978
who's probably still strung out

947
00:50:18,983 --> 00:50:20,893
on your goddamn couch.

948
00:50:20,885 --> 00:50:22,385
Drew: Anorexic geisha slut?

949
00:50:22,387 --> 00:50:23,747
Katie: You know what I mean.

950
00:50:23,754 --> 00:50:26,224
I thought that we
were good, you know,

951
00:50:26,224 --> 00:50:29,164
I thought that we
were on the good path.

952
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,030
Drew: Listen, can we, can we

953
00:50:31,028 --> 00:50:32,728
just talk about this later?

954
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:35,400
It's just I'm in the middle
of fixing something major

955
00:50:35,400 --> 00:50:37,640
right now and I could
lose out on much more

956
00:50:37,635 --> 00:50:38,835
than the job if I don't
figure it out quickly.

957
00:50:38,836 --> 00:50:40,336
Katie: No, that's fine. You go.

958
00:50:40,338 --> 00:50:42,968
No-no, you just go, you
go and you do this shit,

959
00:50:42,973 --> 00:50:44,713
okay and you just,
you get the job.

960
00:50:44,709 --> 00:50:48,009
You, you know, you'll
just have, you'll have

961
00:50:48,012 --> 00:50:49,652
plenty of time to
devote to Lance

962
00:50:49,647 --> 00:50:51,777
without me inconveniencing you.

963
00:50:51,782 --> 00:50:52,982
Drew: Can we maybe
talk about this

964
00:50:52,983 --> 00:50:54,523
when you're not drunk?

965
00:50:54,519 --> 00:51:01,129
Katie: Fuck you. Fuck
you fuckin' Drew, you -

966
00:51:01,126 --> 00:51:05,056
Drew: (sighs)

967
00:51:17,074 --> 00:51:20,914
Drew: Where the hell
is he getting this?

968
00:51:20,911 --> 00:51:23,251
Agent Granger:
[unintelligible] corsets.

969
00:51:23,248 --> 00:51:25,018
Sorry. Did I startle you?

970
00:51:25,015 --> 00:51:27,015
Seemed like I
startled you there.

971
00:51:27,017 --> 00:51:29,247
Nobody was answering
the front door

972
00:51:29,254 --> 00:51:31,994
so I just thought I'd
come around the side gate.

973
00:51:31,989 --> 00:51:33,559
I hope that's okay Mr. Bryant.

974
00:51:33,558 --> 00:51:34,758
Drew: I'm not Lance Bryant.

975
00:51:34,759 --> 00:51:36,659
How many times do I
have to tell you people?

976
00:51:36,661 --> 00:51:38,231
Agent Granger: How
many of us people

977
00:51:38,229 --> 00:51:40,099
have been by here already?

978
00:51:40,097 --> 00:51:41,867
Drew: Wait. Who,
who are you exactly?

979
00:51:41,866 --> 00:51:44,466
Agent Granger:
Exactly? Edwin Granger.

980
00:51:44,469 --> 00:51:48,069
Immigration and Customs.

981
00:51:48,072 --> 00:51:52,182
Mr. Bryant on the premises?

982
00:51:52,177 --> 00:51:55,907
Drew: Well, uh, Lance,
Mr. Bryant, is out,

983
00:51:55,913 --> 00:51:58,553
out of town that is.

984
00:51:58,549 --> 00:52:01,149
Agent Granger: Umm,
(claps) there it is.

985
00:52:01,152 --> 00:52:06,962
How convenient. For
him, not for me.

986
00:52:06,957 --> 00:52:09,827
Drew: Is he in some
kind of trouble?

987
00:52:09,827 --> 00:52:12,757
Agent Granger: Has he mentioned
anything about a young woman?

988
00:52:12,763 --> 00:52:16,473
Drew: Uh, no.

989
00:52:16,467 --> 00:52:20,637
Spencer: Very impressive Kamal.

990
00:52:20,638 --> 00:52:24,108
Very impressive indeed.

991
00:52:24,108 --> 00:52:26,738
Kamal: Yeah, SlicePro
does not fuck around.

992
00:52:26,744 --> 00:52:30,114
Spence: No, it does
not fuck around.

993
00:52:30,114 --> 00:52:32,284
It's not fucking around
in my hand. Is it?

994
00:52:32,283 --> 00:52:34,853
Kamal and Spencer: (laughing)

995
00:52:34,852 --> 00:52:36,492
Spencer: That feels
so good. (chop)

996
00:52:36,487 --> 00:52:37,657
So tell me.

997
00:52:37,655 --> 00:52:38,585
What is it that you and Drew

998
00:52:38,589 --> 00:52:41,789
Kamal: What?

999
00:52:41,792 --> 00:52:45,562
I'm just curious. I have
a curious bone in me.

1000
00:52:45,563 --> 00:52:47,633
Two young men in that house.

1001
00:52:47,632 --> 00:52:49,902
All that luxury at
your fingertips.

1002
00:52:49,900 --> 00:52:54,070
All the opulence.

1003
00:52:54,071 --> 00:52:56,841
Kamal: You know, I can throw in

1004
00:52:56,841 --> 00:52:58,711
a pair of scissors that
can cut through a penny.

1005
00:52:58,709 --> 00:53:01,309
Spence: (chop) You've
done it again Kamal.

1006
00:53:01,312 --> 00:53:03,382
I'll take it. All the
knives and the case.

1007
00:53:03,381 --> 00:53:05,381
Kamal: No shit.

1008
00:53:05,383 --> 00:53:07,393
Spencer: But before we settle up

1009
00:53:07,385 --> 00:53:10,115
I'm going to need to medicate.

1010
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,720
Kamal: Medicate?

1011
00:53:11,722 --> 00:53:13,692
Drew: Human trafficking.

1012
00:53:13,691 --> 00:53:16,761
Agent Granger: Yeah, but
not your run of the mill

1013
00:53:16,761 --> 00:53:21,031
hop on the pick-up over the
border kind of bullshit either.

1014
00:53:21,031 --> 00:53:24,871
We're talking ... I
can't get into details,

1015
00:53:24,869 --> 00:53:26,499
but I'm just going
to tell you this

1016
00:53:26,504 --> 00:53:28,774
it's a global
trafficking organization

1017
00:53:28,773 --> 00:53:31,583
that specializes in
sexual exploitation.

1018
00:53:31,576 --> 00:53:33,406
Are you familiar
with sex slavery?

1019
00:53:33,411 --> 00:53:36,111
Drew: You mean like
mail order brides?

1020
00:53:36,113 --> 00:53:37,983
Agent Granger: No, I don't
mean mail order brides.

1021
00:53:37,982 --> 00:53:40,422
Mail order brides they enter
that stuff in by choice.

1022
00:53:40,418 --> 00:53:43,488
Companies like ForeignFlames.com

1023
00:53:43,488 --> 00:53:45,058
are actually sanctioned.

1024
00:53:45,055 --> 00:53:46,115
They got sponsors.

1025
00:53:46,123 --> 00:53:48,463
They got a website
and a web master.

1026
00:53:48,459 --> 00:53:52,929
I'm talking about women,
children, and men,

1027
00:53:52,930 --> 00:53:55,430
men like you and me having sex

1028
00:53:55,433 --> 00:53:57,743
against our free will.

1029
00:53:57,735 --> 00:54:01,165
You and I in a room
performing Caesar salad

1030
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:03,571
on the side add the chicken.

1031
00:54:03,574 --> 00:54:05,214
If you know what I mean?

1032
00:54:05,209 --> 00:54:06,479
That's a position.

1033
00:54:06,477 --> 00:54:08,977
That's an elicit position
that's very common now

1034
00:54:08,979 --> 00:54:12,779
and has been since 1997.

1035
00:54:12,783 --> 00:54:17,863
Drew: No way. Not,
not, not Lance.

1036
00:54:17,855 --> 00:54:21,785
No, he's a pillar
of the community.

1037
00:54:21,792 --> 00:54:28,372
You know, on the "Forty
under 40" list, twice.

1038
00:54:28,366 --> 00:54:31,396
Agent Granger: Huh!
Fifth grade merit badge.

1039
00:54:31,402 --> 00:54:35,542
Ninth grade, I put a salamander
into a microwave oven.

1040
00:54:35,540 --> 00:54:40,480
People change.

1041
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:50,187
Spencer: Are you
enjoying my robe?

1042
00:54:50,187 --> 00:54:51,917
Kamal: It's quite nice.

1043
00:54:51,922 --> 00:54:53,362
Spencer: Please partake.

1044
00:54:53,358 --> 00:54:54,428
Kamal: No, I probably shouldn't.

1045
00:54:54,425 --> 00:54:55,625
Spencer: You probably should.

1046
00:54:55,626 --> 00:54:57,496
It's grade A Kamal.
It's very medicinal.

1047
00:54:57,495 --> 00:54:59,195
You see as a professor at
a top tier medical school

1048
00:54:59,196 --> 00:55:03,426
I'm awarding certain,
um, best to say this,

1049
00:55:03,434 --> 00:55:06,504
benefits, no, no, boons rather

1050
00:55:06,504 --> 00:55:09,774
that other people like
yourself aren't accustomed to.

1051
00:55:09,774 --> 00:55:12,414
So please, please partake.

1052
00:55:12,410 --> 00:55:21,620
Allow me. Yes, very good Kamal.

1053
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:24,359
That's it. Now
it's working well.

1054
00:55:24,355 --> 00:55:26,485
Very good yes.

1055
00:55:26,491 --> 00:55:27,791
Kamal: (coughs)

1056
00:55:27,792 --> 00:55:30,332
Spencer: Very good.
[unintelligible]

1057
00:55:30,327 --> 00:55:32,297
Now, where were we?

1058
00:55:32,296 --> 00:55:33,296
Oh, I remember.

1059
00:55:33,297 --> 00:55:34,497
You were telling me

1060
00:55:34,499 --> 00:55:35,969
what you were doing
over at the house.

1061
00:55:35,966 --> 00:55:37,126
Kamal: Was I?

1062
00:55:37,134 --> 00:55:38,674
Spencer: Yes, you were.

1063
00:55:38,669 --> 00:55:40,169
Spencer: Yes you were.

1064
00:55:40,170 --> 00:55:42,070
You see from my place very
difficult for me to see,

1065
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:43,712
but I thought, I
thought possibly

1066
00:55:43,708 --> 00:55:45,808
that you might have
had company over there.

1067
00:55:45,810 --> 00:55:46,780
Kamal: Company?

1068
00:55:46,777 --> 00:55:48,247
Spencer: Yes company.

1069
00:55:48,245 --> 00:55:50,475
That's right.
Tick-tock you're fine.

1070
00:55:50,481 --> 00:55:51,951
Company. That's right.

1071
00:55:51,949 --> 00:55:54,789
You see I have a poor
vantage point from my place.

1072
00:55:54,785 --> 00:55:59,185
But I thought possibly,
just possibly you might

1073
00:55:59,189 --> 00:56:00,829
have had a young woman
over at the house.

1074
00:56:00,825 --> 00:56:03,825
Kamal: (feels sick)

1075
00:56:03,828 --> 00:56:05,198
Spencer: Oh-oh,
oh-oh, all right now.

1076
00:56:05,195 --> 00:56:06,525
Drew: What is this?

1077
00:56:06,531 --> 00:56:09,631
Agent Granger: That
was a wire transfer

1078
00:56:09,634 --> 00:56:12,374
from Lance's account to
an account in the Ukraine.

1079
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:16,869
And you know what the
Ukraine's chief exports are?

1080
00:56:16,874 --> 00:56:19,584
Weapons grade plutonium and

1081
00:56:19,577 --> 00:56:22,547
hot white pasty Euro ass.

1082
00:56:22,547 --> 00:56:26,677
Drew: Looks, looks
like a lot of figures.

1083
00:56:26,684 --> 00:56:28,754
Agent Granger: Yeah, yeah,

1084
00:56:28,753 --> 00:56:29,893
people with a lot of figures

1085
00:56:29,887 --> 00:56:33,657
tend to do a lot of
questionable things.

1086
00:56:33,658 --> 00:56:35,388
Look, I'm not saying that
Lance is involved directly

1087
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,932
I'm just saying that somebody

1088
00:56:36,927 --> 00:56:38,897
very close to him may be.

1089
00:56:38,896 --> 00:56:42,426
What's the old saying go? Hmm?

1090
00:56:42,433 --> 00:56:44,643
Good friend help you move,

1091
00:56:44,635 --> 00:56:49,065
great friend help you
move a body. Exactly.

1092
00:56:49,073 --> 00:56:54,513
He's a powerful man.
He's got a lot of pull.

1093
00:56:54,512 --> 00:57:00,522
You have him call me
when he gets back. OK?

1094
00:57:02,487 --> 00:57:08,857
By the way, um, do
you have anybody

1095
00:57:08,859 --> 00:57:11,559
who can stay with you
while you're here?

1096
00:57:11,562 --> 00:57:13,462
You know, if Lance is involved

1097
00:57:13,464 --> 00:57:15,774
with what we think
he is involved with,

1098
00:57:15,766 --> 00:57:19,996
there is no telling
who might turn up here.

1099
00:57:20,004 --> 00:57:23,944
You know, like a good
friend you can trust?

1100
00:57:23,941 --> 00:57:25,641
Drew: Yeah, I don't, I
don't really have anyone.

1101
00:57:25,643 --> 00:57:27,683
Agent Granger: Yeah,
I didn't think so.

1102
00:57:27,678 --> 00:57:30,948
Spencer: (claps hands)

1103
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:32,048
Look, I'm prying.

1104
00:57:32,049 --> 00:57:34,179
I shouldn't be prying.

1105
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:35,224
Kamal: You shouldn't be prying.

1106
00:57:35,219 --> 00:57:36,089
Spencer: No, I
shouldn't be prying,

1107
00:57:36,086 --> 00:57:37,346
but I do want to remind you

1108
00:57:37,354 --> 00:57:39,094
this whole area here
everything here,

1109
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:40,489
this is a neighborhood, hey,

1110
00:57:40,491 --> 00:57:41,831
this is a neighborhood
watch zone.

1111
00:57:41,826 --> 00:57:43,886
Kamal: Huh! You're the neighbor?

1112
00:57:43,894 --> 00:57:46,564
Spencer: I'm the
neighbor. (laughs)

1113
00:57:46,564 --> 00:57:49,704
Look at me the
big neighbor here.

1114
00:57:49,700 --> 00:57:51,870
I'm the neighbor
and I want to know

1115
00:57:51,869 --> 00:57:53,739
who she was and how she ended up

1116
00:57:53,738 --> 00:57:55,968
on your doorstep?

1117
00:57:55,973 --> 00:57:57,373
Now I'm not saying that
she came there for you.

1118
00:57:57,374 --> 00:57:58,914
I'm not even saying
that you knew

1119
00:57:58,909 --> 00:58:01,779
that she came in the
first place. Uh-hum.

1120
00:58:01,779 --> 00:58:03,349
It's clear to me that Drew

1121
00:58:03,347 --> 00:58:05,477
is the one that's in charge.

1122
00:58:05,482 --> 00:58:06,782
Kamal: Drew's an asshole.

1123
00:58:06,784 --> 00:58:08,194
Spencer: Yes he is.

1124
00:58:08,185 --> 00:58:09,185
Kamal: Mother fucker.

1125
00:58:09,186 --> 00:58:10,446
Spencer: Mother fucker.

1126
00:58:10,454 --> 00:58:12,724
Kamal: Mother fucker
is one cold bastard.

1127
00:58:12,723 --> 00:58:13,993
Spencer: One cold bastard.

1128
00:58:13,991 --> 00:58:15,461
What are you saying Kamal?

1129
00:58:15,459 --> 00:58:17,999
Are you saying that Drew

1130
00:58:17,995 --> 00:58:21,665
is capable of cold,
unspeakable acts?

1131
00:58:21,666 --> 00:58:22,466
Kamal: Shit yeah.

1132
00:58:22,466 --> 00:58:24,366
The guy is heartless.

1133
00:58:24,368 --> 00:58:27,738
Nothing is good enough for him.

1134
00:58:27,738 --> 00:58:31,008
Nobody is worthy of
being in his presence.

1135
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:33,708
Spencer: Hmm, a cowboy.

1136
00:58:33,711 --> 00:58:35,451
You're saying
there's a little bit

1137
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:37,005
of a cowboy in him.

1138
00:58:37,014 --> 00:58:38,454
Are you telling me that

1139
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:40,478
the basic fundamental principles

1140
00:58:40,484 --> 00:58:42,154
of life don't apply to him?

1141
00:58:42,152 --> 00:58:43,922
Kamal: Principles?

1142
00:58:43,921 --> 00:58:45,191
Spencer: Principles.

1143
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:46,719
Kamal: I could go on
about the principles.

1144
00:58:46,724 --> 00:58:47,994
Spencer: Go on about
the principles.

1145
00:58:47,992 --> 00:58:49,392
Look at you. You're distraught.

1146
00:58:49,393 --> 00:58:52,603
There's a war raging
inside of you right now.

1147
00:58:52,597 --> 00:58:54,497
You've got to battle it.

1148
00:58:54,498 --> 00:58:58,638
[unintelligible] teaches
us that in our inner self

1149
00:58:58,636 --> 00:59:00,636
that there is a
war, a raging battle

1150
00:59:00,638 --> 00:59:02,538
we need to free ourselves.

1151
00:59:02,539 --> 00:59:04,439
Free yourself.

1152
00:59:04,441 --> 00:59:06,841
What were you doing
in the house Kamal?

1153
00:59:06,844 --> 00:59:09,184
Yes, the battle.

1154
00:59:09,179 --> 00:59:11,079
Kamal: War

1155
00:59:11,081 --> 00:59:11,951
Spencer: Yes, tell me
what you were doing

1156
00:59:11,949 --> 00:59:13,019
inside of the house, Kamal?

1157
00:59:13,017 --> 00:59:14,987
Yes, Kamal, yes.

1158
00:59:14,985 --> 00:59:22,925
Kamal: I got to puke.

1159
00:59:22,927 --> 00:59:26,557
Spencer: Not on my robe.

1160
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:37,543
(footsteps)

1161
00:59:41,712 --> 00:59:51,862
(Music)

1162
00:59:51,856 --> 01:00:01,866
(Music)

1163
01:00:09,640 --> 01:00:16,480
Drew: OW!

1164
01:00:19,249 --> 01:00:20,889
(knocking)

1165
01:00:20,885 --> 01:00:22,685
Spencer: Kamal, how
are you feeling?

1166
01:00:22,687 --> 01:00:25,757
I have a fine, fine cup of
Earl Grey with your name on it.

1167
01:00:25,756 --> 01:00:38,666
Kamal (hisses)

1168
01:00:42,272 --> 01:00:48,252
Drew: (blinded and stumbles)

1169
01:00:48,245 --> 01:00:55,585
(ominous music)

1170
01:00:55,585 --> 01:01:04,585
Drew: Marta. Oh,
Marta. Oh my God.

1171
01:01:04,594 --> 01:01:11,244
Oh, not you too. Marta
(crying hysterically)

1172
01:01:11,235 --> 01:01:12,995
Marta: I don't
know what happened.

1173
01:01:13,003 --> 01:01:16,213
[unintelligible] Please
don't tell Mr. Lance.

1174
01:01:16,206 --> 01:01:17,976
My children, I
have many children.

1175
01:01:17,975 --> 01:01:21,745
I promise Mr. Lance not
to sleep no more at work,

1176
01:01:21,746 --> 01:01:23,446
but my children.

1177
01:01:23,447 --> 01:01:24,647
I have many children.

1178
01:01:24,648 --> 01:01:27,848
I get sleepy. Please.

1179
01:01:27,852 --> 01:01:33,692
Drew: (Sighs)

1180
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:37,860
Everybody, everybody
around me is just dropping,

1181
01:01:37,862 --> 01:01:40,462
you know, Marta, they're
just dropping like flies

1182
01:01:40,464 --> 01:01:43,534
like everyone I'm
close to they're just,

1183
01:01:43,533 --> 01:01:46,773
they're just leaving
me and I saw you

1184
01:01:46,771 --> 01:01:50,571
and I thought what -

1185
01:01:50,574 --> 01:01:52,614
I'm so fucked right now Marta.

1186
01:01:52,609 --> 01:01:56,209
Everything is completely
falling apart.

1187
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:57,653
Everything I've tried
it just fucks up,

1188
01:01:57,647 --> 01:02:00,747
you know, I'm so fucked.

1189
01:02:00,751 --> 01:02:03,851
I'm such a fuck. (crying)

1190
01:02:03,854 --> 01:02:05,524
Marta: It's going
to be okay Mr. Drew.

1191
01:02:05,522 --> 01:02:07,022
It's going to be
okay. Get up. Get up.

1192
01:02:07,024 --> 01:02:08,664
Drew: I'm too much
of a fuck. (crying)

1193
01:02:08,658 --> 01:02:10,628
Marta: Sometimes you
must break things apart

1194
01:02:10,627 --> 01:02:12,457
in order to put
it back together.

1195
01:02:12,462 --> 01:02:16,072
I must do sometimes
with the toilet

1196
01:02:16,066 --> 01:02:17,696
when it clogs up with crap.

1197
01:02:17,701 --> 01:02:20,501
Drew: The crap? Huh? What?

1198
01:02:20,504 --> 01:02:22,744
Marta: Yeah today. I
have to clog it up.

1199
01:02:22,739 --> 01:02:25,039
Drew: Oh.

1200
01:02:25,042 --> 01:02:27,442
Marta: It's okay, it's okay.

1201
01:02:27,444 --> 01:02:29,084
You gonna be okay.

1202
01:02:29,079 --> 01:02:33,779
Drew: It's okay Marta.
I'm good. I'm good.

1203
01:02:33,784 --> 01:02:43,934
(Music - birds singing)

1204
01:02:43,928 --> 01:02:50,838
(Music - birds singing)

1205
01:02:50,835 --> 01:02:58,705
Kamal: Hey man.

1206
01:02:58,708 --> 01:03:01,408
It's pretty fascinating. Huh?

1207
01:03:01,411 --> 01:03:04,311
Kamal: Yeah, "War Maiden."

1208
01:03:04,314 --> 01:03:06,084
Spencer: Huh?

1209
01:03:06,083 --> 01:03:08,553
Kamal: The name of the
movie we shot in school.

1210
01:03:08,552 --> 01:03:11,362
It was "Apocalypse Now"
meets "Breakfast Club,"

1211
01:03:11,355 --> 01:03:12,685
is how we pitched it.

1212
01:03:12,689 --> 01:03:16,329
Drew: That's right.
(laughs) Man.

1213
01:03:16,326 --> 01:03:19,796
Kamal: The death
scene off the roof?

1214
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,696
Classic.

1215
01:03:21,698 --> 01:03:25,138
Drew: Yeah, I saw scars
from those homemade squibs.

1216
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:29,735
It sucks you left man.

1217
01:03:29,739 --> 01:03:33,139
Could have made a
ton more of those.

1218
01:03:33,143 --> 01:03:35,783
Kamal: Do you even know
why I transferred Drew?

1219
01:03:35,779 --> 01:03:39,579
You remember when
you and your friends

1220
01:03:39,583 --> 01:03:43,193
fucked with my family.

1221
01:03:43,187 --> 01:03:46,857
Chris Arnold, Bobbie
Barnes, Brett Kendle.

1222
01:03:46,857 --> 01:03:52,127
I know you were with them.

1223
01:03:52,129 --> 01:03:54,029
Drew: I was 15.

1224
01:03:54,031 --> 01:03:56,371
Kamal: We were best friends.

1225
01:03:56,366 --> 01:04:05,506
Do you even know what it's
like to be stabbed in the back?

1226
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:11,119
Drew: I'm sorry man. I am.

1227
01:04:11,115 --> 01:04:15,445
If I had known how much
that, that hurt you

1228
01:04:15,452 --> 01:04:17,592
I, I would have ...

1229
01:04:17,587 --> 01:04:21,787
Kamal: Yeah.

1230
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:30,171
Drew: Those guys were a
bunch of fucking dicks man.

1231
01:04:30,167 --> 01:04:37,607
I don't know why I
hung out with them.

1232
01:04:37,607 --> 01:04:42,377
I, I'm sure they've all
gained about 100 pounds.

1233
01:04:42,379 --> 01:04:44,379
Kumal: Yeah, 150 pounds.

1234
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:45,651
Drew: Yeah, probably
still all hanging out.

1235
01:04:45,649 --> 01:04:46,849
Kamal: Probably.

1236
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:48,190
Drew: Probably still
going to the high school

1237
01:04:48,185 --> 01:04:50,485
football games on
Saturdays [unintelligible]

1238
01:04:50,487 --> 01:04:53,917
Kamal: (laughs) (sighs)

1239
01:04:53,924 --> 01:04:59,164
Drew: Look man I
think you actually

1240
01:04:59,163 --> 01:05:01,103
might be right about Lance.

1241
01:05:01,098 --> 01:05:05,238
He's just, it's just
nothing adds up,

1242
01:05:05,235 --> 01:05:08,035
you know, him leaving
town and all these

1243
01:05:08,038 --> 01:05:10,668
random people stopping by.

1244
01:05:10,674 --> 01:05:14,844
This whole thing has
gotten so out of control.

1245
01:05:14,844 --> 01:05:18,184
Kamal: Yeah, but it's
your dream job man.

1246
01:05:18,182 --> 01:05:22,092
Drew: There's other
jobs, you know.

1247
01:05:22,086 --> 01:05:24,646
The point is a job
with Lance isn't going

1248
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:27,524
to mean anything if I
end up going to jail.

1249
01:05:27,524 --> 01:05:30,664
Kamal: So what are you saying?

1250
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:33,500
Drew: I'm saying let's do it.

1251
01:05:33,497 --> 01:05:36,197
Your way this time.

1252
01:05:36,200 --> 01:05:38,540
Kamal: Sure?

1253
01:05:38,535 --> 01:05:42,935
Drew: Yeah, I, I can't
do it without you.

1254
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:47,739
Kamal: So the third and final
principle of success is effort.

1255
01:05:47,744 --> 01:05:51,884
No one gets nowhere
without 120% effort.

1256
01:05:51,881 --> 01:05:54,151
Take the the biggest
and best shots possible.

1257
01:05:54,151 --> 01:05:56,221
Go big or go the fuck home.

1258
01:05:56,220 --> 01:05:59,360
Drew: Just tell
me how to proceed.

1259
01:05:59,356 --> 01:06:06,596
Kamal: First off, I'm going to
need you to prep the stables.

1260
01:06:06,596 --> 01:06:11,536
Drew: Prep it for what?

1261
01:06:11,535 --> 01:06:13,365
Kamal: Blood Drew.

1262
01:06:13,370 --> 01:06:16,210
The're going to
be a lot of blood.

1263
01:06:16,206 --> 01:06:20,106
While you're doing that
I'll be prepping the tools.

1264
01:06:20,110 --> 01:06:24,050
We're going to need the
best to pull this off.

1265
01:06:24,048 --> 01:06:29,518
SlicePro. Like I
said, the shits legit.

1266
01:06:29,519 --> 01:06:32,459
(sharpening knives)

1267
01:06:32,456 --> 01:06:42,596
(Music)

1268
01:06:42,599 --> 01:06:50,909
(Music)

1269
01:06:50,907 --> 01:06:55,277
Kamal: We'll need to burn
everything that isn't flesh.

1270
01:06:55,279 --> 01:07:06,459
Anything physical that can
connect back to them we burn.

1271
01:07:06,456 --> 01:07:08,956
Drew: [unintelligible] we
chopped up we can't burn those.

1272
01:07:08,958 --> 01:07:10,328
Kamal: Got to
dispose of it here.

1273
01:07:10,327 --> 01:07:12,527
Drew: How?

1274
01:07:12,529 --> 01:07:23,969
(Music)

1275
01:07:23,973 --> 01:07:34,123
(ominous music)

1276
01:07:34,118 --> 01:07:44,128
(ominous music)

1277
01:08:01,645 --> 01:08:03,475
Kamal: You can do this man.

1278
01:08:03,480 --> 01:08:07,450
Just let the blades do the work.

1279
01:08:07,451 --> 01:08:11,491
(thump from knife)

1280
01:08:11,488 --> 01:08:12,888
Dead Girl: Screams

1281
01:08:12,889 --> 01:08:14,659
Kamal: Did you hear me?

1282
01:08:14,658 --> 01:08:18,998
Just let the blades do the work.

1283
01:08:18,995 --> 01:08:24,795
Drew: Yeah, yeah. Let
the blades do the work.

1284
01:08:24,801 --> 01:08:34,941
(ominous music - chopping)

1285
01:08:34,944 --> 01:08:45,764
(ominous music - chopping)

1286
01:08:45,755 --> 01:08:55,895
(ominous music)

1287
01:08:55,899 --> 01:09:03,939
(ominous music)

1288
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:07,980
Spencer: Uh!

1289
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:12,977
(ominous music)

1290
01:09:12,982 --> 01:09:17,092
Vik: Uh, we don't know
what's going on inside there.

1291
01:09:17,421 --> 01:09:20,421
Here, we better go in heavy.

1292
01:09:20,424 --> 01:09:22,494
Allan: Heavy?

1293
01:09:22,492 --> 01:09:24,232
Vik: Heavy.

1294
01:09:24,228 --> 01:09:27,998
When are you going to understand
the fucking' lingo Allan?

1295
01:09:27,997 --> 01:09:29,427
This isn't Shakespeare.

1296
01:09:29,433 --> 01:09:35,443
You want me to say weaponry?

1297
01:09:35,439 --> 01:09:45,579
(chopping and hammering)

1298
01:09:45,582 --> 01:09:57,532
(chopping and hammering)

1299
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:07,702
Kamal: Dude, everything okay?

1300
01:10:07,704 --> 01:10:11,544
Drew: Yeah, yeah,
everything's fine.

1301
01:10:11,541 --> 01:10:13,111
Kamal: I hate to bring you down,

1302
01:10:13,109 --> 01:10:15,709
but we got a problem.

1303
01:10:15,712 --> 01:10:18,382
Mr. Baldwin won't eat.

1304
01:10:18,382 --> 01:10:20,522
Drew: What?

1305
01:10:20,517 --> 01:10:22,087
Kamal: Yeah and he's being

1306
01:10:22,085 --> 01:10:24,785
a real picky bitch about it too.

1307
01:10:24,788 --> 01:10:32,828
Drew: Oh wait. I think
I know what to do.

1308
01:10:32,829 --> 01:10:44,239
(Sighs) Fuck. (Sighs)

1309
01:10:44,240 --> 01:10:50,510
Mmmm. You don't know what
you're missing Mr. Baldwin.

1310
01:10:50,514 --> 01:10:54,054
It's so good Mr. Baldwin.

1311
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:57,050
You don't know what
you're missing man.

1312
01:10:57,053 --> 01:11:02,633
(gagging) That's
great. Right Kamal?

1313
01:11:02,626 --> 01:11:05,086
Kamal: Uh.

1314
01:11:05,094 --> 01:11:09,674
Drew: (gagging) So good.

1315
01:11:09,666 --> 01:11:14,696
Kamal: Oh, Mmmm, Oh
yeah, I've never had

1316
01:11:14,704 --> 01:11:16,714
such divine human before.

1317
01:11:16,706 --> 01:11:21,646
Drew: Mmmm, so tender, juicy.

1318
01:11:22,546 --> 01:11:26,416
You should try it
Mr. Baldwin. Come on.

1319
01:11:26,416 --> 01:11:28,486
Mr. Baldwin: (Eating)

1320
01:11:28,485 --> 01:11:30,945
Drew: There you
go. Good, good boy.

1321
01:11:30,954 --> 01:11:35,564
Oh thank God. Oh fuck.

1322
01:11:35,559 --> 01:11:37,559
Kamal: It's so nice in my hands.

1323
01:11:37,561 --> 01:11:38,631
Drew: Dude you can stop.

1324
01:11:38,628 --> 01:11:40,158
He's eating, he's
eating, come on.

1325
01:11:40,764 --> 01:11:43,074
Drew: Okay, so we'll
have a drink while

1326
01:11:43,066 --> 01:11:44,366
Mr. Baldwin is eating.

1327
01:11:44,368 --> 01:11:48,198
Clean up anything left
and then call it a day.

1328
01:11:48,204 --> 01:11:59,424
(ominous music)

1329
01:11:59,416 --> 01:12:02,886
Katrina: Lance? Lance Bryant?

1330
01:12:02,886 --> 01:12:06,056
I here to make wife.

1331
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:07,085
Drew: Oh.

1332
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:09,990
Katrina: (Ukrainian) Katrina.

1333
01:12:09,993 --> 01:12:13,263
Drew: Can you, can you
give us a second? Please.

1334
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:16,902
Just one second. Yeah.

1335
01:12:16,900 --> 01:12:26,380
What? Please, just
back up a little bit.

1336
01:12:26,376 --> 01:12:27,736
Um, just move, yeah just.

1337
01:12:27,744 --> 01:12:30,084
Kamal: We're not
talking about you.

1338
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:32,579
Drew: Nope. Thank
you. What the fuck?

1339
01:12:32,582 --> 01:12:36,192
Kamal: If that's Lance's girl
who the fuck did we chop up?

1340
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:38,485
Drew: I don't know man.

1341
01:12:38,488 --> 01:12:39,388
I should have called the
police to start with.

1342
01:12:39,389 --> 01:12:40,559
What the fuck was I thinking?

1343
01:12:40,557 --> 01:12:41,727
Kamal: What the hell
are you talking about?

1344
01:12:41,725 --> 01:12:42,825
I'm the one who wanted
to call the police.

1345
01:12:42,826 --> 01:12:44,456
You're the one
obsessed with this job.

1346
01:12:44,461 --> 01:12:47,031
Drew: I just wanted to box
her back up the way she was.

1347
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:49,530
You're the one who
wanted to fuckin'

1348
01:12:49,533 --> 01:12:52,103
Now we dismembered her
body for no reason.

1349
01:12:52,101 --> 01:12:53,341
Kamal: Two actually.

1350
01:12:53,336 --> 01:12:55,096
Drew: Two bodies.
We're so fucked.

1351
01:12:55,271 --> 01:12:58,071
Kamal: No it's okay. We're okay.

1352
01:12:58,074 --> 01:12:59,984
Drew: How are we okay?

1353
01:12:59,976 --> 01:13:02,506
Kamal: We took care
of one girl. Right?

1354
01:13:02,512 --> 01:13:04,882
Drew: And the security guard.

1355
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:08,521
Kamal: Any evidence is gone.

1356
01:13:08,518 --> 01:13:10,188
Drew: Yeah-yeah.

1357
01:13:10,186 --> 01:13:11,856
Kamal: And now
Lance's girl showed up

1358
01:13:11,855 --> 01:13:13,815
so we're golden.

1359
01:13:13,823 --> 01:13:15,963
Drew: How are we golden?

1360
01:13:15,959 --> 01:13:16,859
Kamal: We're clear man.

1361
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:18,060
We never bring up the bodies.

1362
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:19,131
Drew: Of course not.

1363
01:13:19,128 --> 01:13:20,428
Kamal: Lance gets his girl

1364
01:13:20,430 --> 01:13:21,600
and nobody goes to jail.

1365
01:13:21,598 --> 01:13:23,098
Everybody wins.

1366
01:13:23,099 --> 01:13:24,629
Drew: Yeah,
everybody wins, yeah.

1367
01:13:24,634 --> 01:13:26,904
Kamal: Now let's get back to her

1368
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:28,543
before she dies of boredom

1369
01:13:28,538 --> 01:13:30,708
and we have to chop her up too.

1370
01:13:30,707 --> 01:13:32,477
Kamal: Twosome?

1371
01:13:32,476 --> 01:13:33,576
Kamal: Ready?

1372
01:13:37,146 --> 01:13:39,946
Drew and Kamal: Hi.

1373
01:13:39,949 --> 01:13:41,249
Katrina: Hello.

1374
01:13:41,250 --> 01:13:44,790
Drew: We have been
expecting you. Yeah?

1375
01:13:44,788 --> 01:13:45,458
Kamal: Yeah.

1376
01:13:45,455 --> 01:13:46,485
Katrina: Lance?

1377
01:13:46,490 --> 01:13:49,230
Drew and Kamal:
No, no, not Lance.

1378
01:13:49,225 --> 01:13:50,285
Katrina: Knwet?

1379
01:13:50,293 --> 01:13:51,363
Katrina: Lance?

1380
01:13:51,360 --> 01:13:52,900
Kamal: No, I'm not Lance either.

1381
01:13:52,896 --> 01:13:55,326
I really want to
be, but I'm not.

1382
01:13:55,331 --> 01:13:59,771
Drew: Um, oh, oh,
actually that's Lance.

1383
01:13:59,769 --> 01:14:02,169
Um, the man in the picture.

1384
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:03,571
Katrina: Lance?

1385
01:14:03,573 --> 01:14:05,583
Drew: In the woods,
yep, that's Lance.

1386
01:14:05,575 --> 01:14:07,335
Kamal: Tak.

1387
01:14:07,577 --> 01:14:09,647
Drew: So Lance will
be here tomorrow.

1388
01:14:09,646 --> 01:14:11,376
Um, so you'll stay
the night here

1389
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:13,550
and then tomorrow
you'll see Lance.

1390
01:14:13,550 --> 01:14:15,250
Kamal: You look thirsty sweetie.

1391
01:14:15,251 --> 01:14:17,551
You want some vodka?

1392
01:14:17,554 --> 01:14:19,864
Katrina: Vodka?

1393
01:14:19,856 --> 01:14:21,186
Katrina: Oh, tak.

1394
01:14:21,190 --> 01:14:23,960
Drew: Yeah, yeah.

1395
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,160
Drew: Yeah, that's a great idea.

1396
01:14:25,161 --> 01:14:27,001
Um, so he, he's going
to take you to the bar

1397
01:14:26,996 --> 01:14:28,766
in the kitchen
and get you some -

1398
01:14:28,765 --> 01:14:31,565
Kamal: Vodka.

1399
01:14:31,568 --> 01:14:32,768
Katrina: Vodka? Lance?

1400
01:14:32,769 --> 01:14:34,169
Drew: No, he, Kamal will

1401
01:14:34,170 --> 01:14:35,870
and then I'll
carry your suitcase

1402
01:14:35,872 --> 01:14:37,472
down to the master suite.

1403
01:14:37,473 --> 01:14:40,213
Kamal: Yes. Oh, right
this way my lady.

1404
01:14:40,209 --> 01:14:42,749
Please we go.

1405
01:14:42,746 --> 01:14:47,016
We can talk about Gorbachev.

1406
01:14:47,016 --> 01:14:48,376
Drew: Nice to meet you Katrina.

1407
01:14:48,384 --> 01:14:51,664
Kamal: Oh, what is that red
spot on Gorbachev's head?

1408
01:14:51,655 --> 01:14:59,095
(Knocking and doorbell ringing)

1409
01:14:59,095 --> 01:15:01,495
Drew: Hi.

1410
01:15:01,497 --> 01:15:02,827
Woman: You live here?

1411
01:15:02,832 --> 01:15:04,202
Drew: No actually.

1412
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:06,070
I'm just looking after the
place for the guy that does.

1413
01:15:06,069 --> 01:15:08,669
Woman: Okay. How
long you been here?

1414
01:15:08,672 --> 01:15:12,212
Drew: I guess this will
be my second night.

1415
01:15:12,208 --> 01:15:14,238
Woman: So you were
here yesterday?

1416
01:15:14,243 --> 01:15:17,013
Drew: Can I help
you with something?

1417
01:15:17,013 --> 01:15:19,253
Woman: These look familiar
you son of a bitch?

1418
01:15:19,248 --> 01:15:22,548
They're dollars.

1419
01:15:22,552 --> 01:15:23,892
Drew: Yeah.

1420
01:15:23,887 --> 01:15:25,287
Drew: Yeah, I see that
they're dollar bills.

1421
01:15:25,288 --> 01:15:26,318
Woman: Yeah.

1422
01:15:26,322 --> 01:15:27,422
Drew: Three of them.

1423
01:15:27,423 --> 01:15:28,523
Woman: These are the
exact dollar bills

1424
01:15:28,524 --> 01:15:29,834
that you used to
swindle my scouts

1425
01:15:29,826 --> 01:15:32,026
out of four boxes of thin mints.

1426
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:33,358
Uh-huh, yeah, remembering now?

1427
01:15:33,362 --> 01:15:35,302
Four boxes that are
three-fifty each.

1428
01:15:35,298 --> 01:15:39,668
Drew: Huh! You're right.
I think you're right.

1429
01:15:39,669 --> 01:15:42,209
I'm sorry. I probably
miscounted. It was -

1430
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:44,835
Woman: You think you can rip
off my girls, huh? (punches)

1431
01:15:44,841 --> 01:15:46,681
You think just
'cause they're girls

1432
01:15:46,676 --> 01:15:48,106
you can just ... your bad ass

1433
01:15:48,111 --> 01:15:50,551
can get a discount on some
cookies. (punches three times)

1434
01:15:50,546 --> 01:15:53,946
Yeah, uh-huh, somebody
order a pizza?

1435
01:15:53,950 --> 01:15:55,020
[unintelligible] on top of it.

1436
01:15:55,018 --> 01:15:58,188
Drew: Listen lady
it was a busy day.

1437
01:15:58,187 --> 01:15:59,717
I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking.

1438
01:15:59,723 --> 01:16:01,633
Woman: Yeah I appreciate
you calling me a lady.

1439
01:16:01,625 --> 01:16:02,985
I appreciate that, okay,

1440
01:16:02,992 --> 01:16:04,032
but you know what?

1441
01:16:04,027 --> 01:16:05,187
You weren't thinking.

1442
01:16:05,194 --> 01:16:06,564
You weren't thinking
that those troops

1443
01:16:06,562 --> 01:16:09,902
also had an amateur mixed
martial artist as a leader.

1444
01:16:09,899 --> 01:16:12,439
Woman: Throw down.

1445
01:16:12,435 --> 01:16:13,565
Drew: I didn't know that.

1446
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:14,639
Woman: Throw down.

1447
01:16:14,638 --> 01:16:15,738
Drew: I didn't know
that. I'm sorry.

1448
01:16:15,739 --> 01:16:17,039
I haven't opened the
cookies yet. Okay?

1449
01:16:17,040 --> 01:16:18,210
I'm [unintelligible] for
you. There's three boxes.

1450
01:16:18,207 --> 01:16:19,337
You can take them with you.

1451
01:16:19,342 --> 01:16:21,112
Woman: You think I
want those cookies?

1452
01:16:21,110 --> 01:16:23,280
Look at me. Look at
me in the eyeballs.

1453
01:16:23,279 --> 01:16:25,079
I don't want your
fucking cookies.

1454
01:16:25,081 --> 01:16:27,521
Not after you had your
little hands over them

1455
01:16:27,516 --> 01:16:28,616
your little baby hands.

1456
01:16:28,618 --> 01:16:30,088
Did you ever work
a day in your life?

1457
01:16:30,086 --> 01:16:31,856
Those thin mints used
to have dazzle in them

1458
01:16:31,855 --> 01:16:33,785
now they got your little
baby hands on them.

1459
01:16:33,790 --> 01:16:35,090
Drew: Okay.

1460
01:16:35,091 --> 01:16:36,361
Woman: Your man juice.

1461
01:16:36,359 --> 01:16:37,829
Drew: Okay, okay, what
do you want from me then?

1462
01:16:37,827 --> 01:16:39,257
Woman: You know what I want?

1463
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:41,002
Woman: I want you to pay
me back [unintelligible]

1464
01:16:40,997 --> 01:16:42,227
for those cookies
that you stole. Okay?

1465
01:16:42,231 --> 01:16:43,531
Yeah. Full reimbursement.

1466
01:16:43,532 --> 01:16:45,172
Plus you're going
to reimburse me

1467
01:16:45,168 --> 01:16:46,838
for the mileage
that it took for me

1468
01:16:46,836 --> 01:16:48,866
to drive my SUV all the way over

1469
01:16:48,872 --> 01:16:50,642
to this well-heeled
neighborhood.

1470
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,810
Drew: That's not a problem.

1471
01:16:51,808 --> 01:16:54,678
Woman: Oh good. Good.
Shake your head yes.

1472
01:16:54,678 --> 01:16:55,648
Shake your head yes.

1473
01:16:55,645 --> 01:16:56,745
Drew: My wallet is over there.

1474
01:16:56,746 --> 01:16:57,976
You can take whatever you want.

1475
01:16:57,981 --> 01:16:59,051
Woman: Good, good.

1476
01:16:59,048 --> 01:17:00,978
Drew: Then please leave.

1477
01:17:00,984 --> 01:17:02,094
Woman: I got a date
tonight with a guy.

1478
01:17:02,518 --> 01:17:04,918
Drew: Just take
the whole wallet.

1479
01:17:04,921 --> 01:17:07,891
Woman: All right, all right.

1480
01:17:07,891 --> 01:17:09,191
Woman: I got [unintelligible]
for that pussy.

1481
01:17:09,192 --> 01:17:10,592
Drew: Actually on second thought

1482
01:17:10,593 --> 01:17:12,563
you can go fuck yourself
and fuck your cookies too.

1483
01:17:12,561 --> 01:17:14,001
Because they taste like shit.

1484
01:17:13,997 --> 01:17:15,897
Woman: Oh, okay.

1485
01:17:15,899 --> 01:17:17,599
Woman: Okay, yeah, yeah.

1486
01:17:17,600 --> 01:17:19,570
Drew: Now listen. Turn around.

1487
01:17:19,568 --> 01:17:20,498
Drew: Walk out that door.

1488
01:17:20,503 --> 01:17:23,043
Woman: Okay, which way do I go?

1489
01:17:23,039 --> 01:17:24,809
Drew: Out the door. Okay?

1490
01:17:24,808 --> 01:17:26,378
Drew: Okay, you got it? (falls)

1491
01:17:26,776 --> 01:17:28,206
Woman: Yeah, I got it.

1492
01:17:28,211 --> 01:17:31,081
Woman: Yeah, you're saying
something about my cookies?

1493
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,180
Drew: (grunting)

1494
01:17:32,181 --> 01:17:34,021
Vik: What the fuck
is going on here?

1495
01:17:34,017 --> 01:17:36,647
That, that, that piece of
shit you're stepping on

1496
01:17:36,652 --> 01:17:38,492
sister he belongs to me.

1497
01:17:38,487 --> 01:17:40,057
Woman:This piece of
shit owes me money.

1498
01:17:40,056 --> 01:17:41,416
Vik: He owes me a
lot more than that.

1499
01:17:41,424 --> 01:17:42,734
Woman: Yeah, well you're going

1500
01:17:42,726 --> 01:17:44,156
to have to wait in line gramps.

1501
01:17:44,160 --> 01:17:46,030
Vik: Uh, but I don't
like waiting in lines.

1502
01:17:46,029 --> 01:17:48,899
Now look, hon, I got to
ask this, this asshole

1503
01:17:48,898 --> 01:17:50,868
some questions about
my granddaughter.

1504
01:17:50,867 --> 01:17:52,867
Then you can have what's left.

1505
01:17:52,869 --> 01:17:54,199
Drew: Look man.

1506
01:17:54,203 --> 01:17:56,173
I don't know anything about
your granddaughter. OK?

1507
01:17:56,172 --> 01:17:57,572
I'm just the house sitter.

1508
01:17:57,573 --> 01:18:00,283
Vik: Oh, you're going
to lie to me now.

1509
01:18:00,276 --> 01:18:07,176
Vik: Fuck, I want to
know how you assholes

1510
01:18:07,183 --> 01:18:10,093
got possession of
my granddaughter.

1511
01:18:10,086 --> 01:18:11,646
Kamal: I already told
Jubakka over here

1512
01:18:11,654 --> 01:18:14,164
she showed up on her
own like 20 minutes ago

1513
01:18:14,157 --> 01:18:15,617
you fucking idiots.

1514
01:18:15,624 --> 01:18:17,164
Alan: Watch your mouth Gandhi.

1515
01:18:17,160 --> 01:18:18,760
Vik: Allan take it easy.

1516
01:18:18,762 --> 01:18:21,972
Agent Granger: All right.
Everyone freeze. DIC.

1517
01:18:21,965 --> 01:18:23,795
The house sitter
is coming with me.

1518
01:18:23,800 --> 01:18:25,770
Woman: Oh, what did
he do to screw you up?

1519
01:18:25,769 --> 01:18:27,239
Agent Granger: Does
it concern you?

1520
01:18:27,236 --> 01:18:29,266
I'm here for him
and Lance Bryant.

1521
01:18:29,272 --> 01:18:30,912
Katrina: Lance?

1522
01:18:30,907 --> 01:18:31,977
Vik: Look, look, look,

1523
01:18:31,975 --> 01:18:33,435
I don't know who you.

1524
01:18:33,442 --> 01:18:34,512
I don't know what you want,

1525
01:18:34,510 --> 01:18:35,580
but I need a little time

1526
01:18:35,578 --> 01:18:36,608
to have some conversation

1527
01:18:36,612 --> 01:18:38,252
with these two jerks here about,

1528
01:18:38,247 --> 01:18:39,647
about my granddaughter

1529
01:18:39,648 --> 01:18:42,588
and then you can do
whatever you want with them.

1530
01:18:42,585 --> 01:18:44,745
Agent Granger: Holy shit.
You're Victor Koslav.

1531
01:18:44,754 --> 01:18:49,464
aka Big Vik Koslav,
aka Big Bad Wolf Koslav

1532
01:18:49,458 --> 01:18:51,858
aka Wolf Face.

1533
01:18:51,861 --> 01:18:53,061
Vik: Yeah, yeah, yeah,

1534
01:18:53,062 --> 01:18:54,602
you heard about me. Huh?

1535
01:18:54,597 --> 01:18:56,467
Agent Granger: Yeah, thought you
were out of this game years ago.

1536
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:58,625
Vik: I'm staging a comeback now,

1537
01:18:58,634 --> 01:19:01,174
but first I want
to get some answers

1538
01:19:01,170 --> 01:19:02,540
from these two idiots.

1539
01:19:02,538 --> 01:19:04,568
Agent Granger: Actually
Vik, you know what?

1540
01:19:04,573 --> 01:19:06,013
You're coming with me, too.

1541
01:19:06,009 --> 01:19:07,479
Vik: I don't think so.

1542
01:19:07,476 --> 01:19:12,016
Allan: Officer, we will make
you an offer you cannot refuse.

1543
01:19:12,015 --> 01:19:12,945
Vik: Allan.

1544
01:19:12,949 --> 01:19:14,079
Agent Granger: Let the girl go

1545
01:19:14,083 --> 01:19:15,893
and tell your man
to lower his weapon.

1546
01:19:15,885 --> 01:19:17,915
Vik: I can't go with you

1547
01:19:17,921 --> 01:19:19,921
because that was one of
my plans for a comeback.

1548
01:19:19,923 --> 01:19:21,423
Agent Granger:
Actually, you know what?

1549
01:19:21,424 --> 01:19:22,534
You're coming with me.

1550
01:19:22,525 --> 01:19:24,525
Everybody is going with me

1551
01:19:24,527 --> 01:19:26,997
into a big, fucking,
happy van downtown.

1552
01:19:26,996 --> 01:19:29,526
We're going to sort it all
out with [unintelligible]

1553
01:19:29,532 --> 01:19:30,902
What the?

1554
01:19:30,900 --> 01:19:31,870
Security Officer Jerry: Hey sir.

1555
01:19:31,868 --> 01:19:32,968
Agent Granger: Hey, hey.

1556
01:19:32,969 --> 01:19:34,199
Security Officer
Jerry: Who's to say

1557
01:19:34,203 --> 01:19:35,473
you even have jurisdiction
in these parts?

1558
01:19:35,471 --> 01:19:36,571
Agent Granger: I'm with
the federal government.

1559
01:19:36,572 --> 01:19:38,012
I have jurisdiction
in every part.

1560
01:19:38,007 --> 01:19:39,437
Security Officer Jerry:
Every suit tells me that.

1561
01:19:39,442 --> 01:19:41,082
Vik: Who the hell are you?

1562
01:19:41,077 --> 01:19:43,347
Security Officer Jerry:
Jerry, Vault Home Security.

1563
01:19:43,346 --> 01:19:46,646
Barry, my brother, he's
been missing all day.

1564
01:19:46,649 --> 01:19:49,489
While people don't say
we look a lot alike,

1565
01:19:49,485 --> 01:19:52,115
but we do we're
easy on the eyes.

1566
01:19:52,121 --> 01:19:54,691
Have any of you seen my brother?

1567
01:19:54,690 --> 01:19:55,960
Agent Granger: Tell you what.

1568
01:19:55,959 --> 01:19:58,959
How about you help me
wrangle these people. OK?

1569
01:19:58,962 --> 01:20:00,532
Then we can look for Jerry.

1570
01:20:00,529 --> 01:20:02,199
Security Officer Jerry: Barry.

1571
01:20:02,198 --> 01:20:04,468
Agent Granger: Have you
checked [unintelligible]

1572
01:20:04,467 --> 01:20:06,537
Security Officer Jerry:
Do you have a warrant?

1573
01:20:06,535 --> 01:20:08,265
Agent Granger: No.

1574
01:20:08,271 --> 01:20:09,911
Security Officer Jerry: Yeah,
you don't have a warrant.

1575
01:20:09,906 --> 01:20:11,236
All right. Since you
don't have a warrant

1576
01:20:11,240 --> 01:20:12,780
I'm going to have to ask you

1577
01:20:12,775 --> 01:20:14,035
to vacate Lance Bryant's house.

1578
01:20:14,043 --> 01:20:16,383
Marta: Mr. Lance no home now.

1579
01:20:16,379 --> 01:20:17,909
Vik: Who are you?

1580
01:20:17,914 --> 01:20:20,554
Marta: I clean your
room now Mr. Drew.

1581
01:20:20,549 --> 01:20:25,419
Oh, I clean later.

1582
01:20:25,421 --> 01:20:27,561
Agent Granger: That's
a good idea Miss.

1583
01:20:27,556 --> 01:20:29,256
We clean later.

1584
01:20:29,258 --> 01:20:36,128
Woman: Thought you
learned your lesson?

1585
01:20:36,132 --> 01:20:37,772
Drew: Fuck.

1586
01:20:37,766 --> 01:20:40,096
Agent Granger: Hey ma'am, I
need you to hold it right there.

1587
01:20:40,103 --> 01:20:41,503
Woman: Maybe I should
grab it myself.

1588
01:20:41,504 --> 01:20:43,174
And fuck off your
nut bag with it.

1589
01:20:43,172 --> 01:20:44,212
You know what?

1590
01:20:44,207 --> 01:20:45,767
Take you dick and shove it up

1591
01:20:45,774 --> 01:20:47,184
where your mom fuckin' put it.

1592
01:20:47,176 --> 01:20:48,576
Agent Granger:
Don't do that ma'am.

1593
01:20:48,577 --> 01:20:50,777
Ma'am do not touch that. MA'AM!

1594
01:20:50,779 --> 01:21:01,089
(gunshots)

1595
01:21:01,090 --> 01:21:02,930
Kamal: What the fuck was that?

1596
01:21:02,926 --> 01:21:04,286
Drew: I don't know man.

1597
01:21:04,293 --> 01:21:05,363
Kamal: Are you okay?

1598
01:21:05,361 --> 01:21:06,731
Drew: Yeah, fine. Are you?

1599
01:21:06,729 --> 01:21:07,999
Kamal: Yeah.

1600
01:21:07,997 --> 01:21:11,727
Kamal: Is it still
considered a Mexican shootout

1601
01:21:11,734 --> 01:21:13,604
if there aren't any
Mexicans involved?

1602
01:21:13,602 --> 01:21:14,942
Drew: What?

1603
01:21:14,938 --> 01:21:17,068
Kamal: I guess Marta
was here for a second.

1604
01:21:17,073 --> 01:21:24,083
Drew: (breathing heavy)

1605
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:27,680
Agent Granger: You
guys want to tell me

1606
01:21:27,683 --> 01:21:29,353
what the fuck that was about?

1607
01:21:29,352 --> 01:21:33,492
Drew: Honestly, I have no idea.

1608
01:21:33,489 --> 01:21:35,319
Everyone showed up
at the same time

1609
01:21:35,324 --> 01:21:37,664
looking for someone
else and I don't know.

1610
01:21:37,660 --> 01:21:42,100
Agent Granger: Well the girl
she's with Lance. Right?

1611
01:21:42,098 --> 01:21:44,268
I mean she's here
with the sex ring

1612
01:21:44,267 --> 01:21:46,037
the whole time he's
involved in all that.

1613
01:21:46,035 --> 01:21:49,305
Drew: No, she was
here by choice.

1614
01:21:49,305 --> 01:21:52,405
I'm pretty sure.
She gave me this.

1615
01:21:52,408 --> 01:21:56,348
Agent Granger: Look, I'm
going to need a statement. OK?

1616
01:21:56,345 --> 01:21:58,275
I need you to come down
and make a statement

1617
01:21:58,281 --> 01:22:00,081
because if what you say is true

1618
01:22:00,083 --> 01:22:02,023
it would really help
in clearing Lance -

1619
01:22:02,018 --> 01:22:03,348
Drew: Behind you.

1620
01:22:03,352 --> 01:22:06,892
Agent Granger: (shoots Vik)

1621
01:22:06,889 --> 01:22:08,719
Drew: Oh, oh,

1622
01:22:08,724 --> 01:22:14,964
Agent Granger: You know what?

1623
01:22:14,964 --> 01:22:18,474
Fuck the statement.

1624
01:22:18,467 --> 01:22:20,537
Drew: Yeah, fuck the statement.

1625
01:22:20,536 --> 01:22:22,436
Agent Granger: I don't
need a statement.

1626
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:24,668
Agent Granger: Yeah
because we're going to have

1627
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:27,983
to take the fuckers off of
Lance right now so just -

1628
01:22:27,977 --> 01:22:34,977
Drew: (breathing heavily)

1629
01:22:34,984 --> 01:22:36,554
we'll just forget
about the statement.

1630
01:22:36,552 --> 01:22:38,552
Agent Granger: Yeah I know.

1631
01:22:38,554 --> 01:22:39,964
Kamal: You'll take
care of them, too.

1632
01:22:39,955 --> 01:22:40,955
Agent Granger: What?

1633
01:22:40,956 --> 01:22:41,986
Kamal: The bodies?

1634
01:22:41,991 --> 01:22:43,261
You'll take care
of the bodies too.

1635
01:22:43,259 --> 01:22:46,199
Agent Granger: Do I look
like a fucking warlock?

1636
01:22:46,195 --> 01:22:50,765
(Music)

1637
01:22:50,766 --> 01:22:51,996
Drew: All right.

1638
01:22:52,001 --> 01:22:53,371
Should probably start
prepping the stables.

1639
01:22:53,369 --> 01:22:55,069
Those bodies aren't going
to dismember themselves.

1640
01:22:55,071 --> 01:22:57,071
Kamal: Five more minutes.

1641
01:22:57,073 --> 01:22:59,743
Let's try and appreciate this
shit for five more minutes.

1642
01:22:59,742 --> 01:23:02,352
Drew: Yeah, you're
right. Five more minutes.

1643
01:23:02,345 --> 01:23:08,245
Spencer: Two-faced bastards.

1644
01:23:08,251 --> 01:23:11,721
Drew: Oh!

1645
01:23:11,720 --> 01:23:12,760
Spencer: Listen Kamal.

1646
01:23:12,755 --> 01:23:14,715
I thought you and
I were friends.

1647
01:23:14,723 --> 01:23:16,893
I thought you and I created
a special relationship.

1648
01:23:16,892 --> 01:23:18,392
Until I found this.

1649
01:23:18,394 --> 01:23:23,874
Uh-hum. I knew you were
keeping her from me.

1650
01:23:23,866 --> 01:23:24,966
I just knew it.

1651
01:23:24,967 --> 01:23:26,497
Kamal: We thought
she was Lances.

1652
01:23:26,502 --> 01:23:27,802
Believe me.

1653
01:23:27,803 --> 01:23:29,313
We totally would have gotten her

1654
01:23:29,305 --> 01:23:31,305
the fuck out of here if
we knew she was yours.

1655
01:23:31,307 --> 01:23:32,437
Trust me.

1656
01:23:32,441 --> 01:23:33,381
Drew: Yeah.

1657
01:23:33,376 --> 01:23:34,506
Spencer: Just because something

1658
01:23:34,510 --> 01:23:35,910
is delivered to you by mistake

1659
01:23:35,911 --> 01:23:37,751
that doesn't give you
the right to open it up.

1660
01:23:37,746 --> 01:23:39,716
Now Kamal knows
that I'm a professor

1661
01:23:39,715 --> 01:23:42,115
that's accustomed
to certain boons

1662
01:23:42,118 --> 01:23:43,648
or benefits rather

1663
01:23:43,652 --> 01:23:46,362
that aren't awarded to
other people easily.

1664
01:23:46,355 --> 01:23:50,155
One such is my
exclusive membership

1665
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:51,929
to a harvested organ
exchange program.

1666
01:23:51,927 --> 01:23:54,357
Drew: A harvested what?

1667
01:23:54,363 --> 01:23:57,203
Spencer: Yeah, it may
not be 100% legal,

1668
01:23:57,200 --> 01:24:00,270
but raw cadavers are
prime for research.

1669
01:24:00,269 --> 01:24:03,369
And this woman died
of natural causes.

1670
01:24:03,372 --> 01:24:04,442
I assure you.

1671
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:06,340
Then she donated
herself to science.

1672
01:24:06,342 --> 01:24:10,412
But she also cost
20 thousand dollars.

1673
01:24:10,413 --> 01:24:15,323
So gentlemen, please tell me

1674
01:24:15,318 --> 01:24:18,148
that you have her
well refrigerated.

1675
01:24:18,154 --> 01:24:19,764
Drew: Oh.

1676
01:24:19,755 --> 01:24:22,225
Kamal: Yeah, about that.

1677
01:24:22,225 --> 01:24:23,585
Spencer: What?

1678
01:24:23,592 --> 01:24:25,492
Drew: Well we really did it
with the best intentions.

1679
01:24:25,494 --> 01:24:26,534
Spencer: You did what?

1680
01:24:26,529 --> 01:24:27,899
Kamal: We chopped her up.

1681
01:24:27,896 --> 01:24:29,726
Drew: Fed her to Mr. Baldwin.

1682
01:24:29,732 --> 01:24:32,702
Spencer: You're telling
me you destroyed her.

1683
01:24:32,701 --> 01:24:36,641
You destroyed her. (sighs)

1684
01:24:36,639 --> 01:24:39,279
Guys you owe me 20 grand.

1685
01:24:39,275 --> 01:24:40,405
Drew: Oh.

1686
01:24:40,409 --> 01:24:41,709
Kamal: We don't have
that kind of money.

1687
01:24:41,710 --> 01:24:44,010
Spencer: Fine. Let's get
Lance to help you get it.

1688
01:24:44,012 --> 01:24:46,522
I'm sure he will
once I explain to him

1689
01:24:46,515 --> 01:24:49,015
what irresponsible house
guests you've been.

1690
01:24:49,017 --> 01:24:50,317
Kamal: Spencer you can't.

1691
01:24:50,319 --> 01:24:53,359
Drew would lose everything
if Lance ever found out.

1692
01:24:53,356 --> 01:24:54,756
Spencer: I don't give a shit.

1693
01:24:54,757 --> 01:24:59,127
Drew: Actually Kamal, I
think I have a solution.

1694
01:24:59,128 --> 01:25:01,828
Spencer: I don't
have time to waste.

1695
01:25:01,830 --> 01:25:04,630
Drew: Yeah, I think
you're going to be happy.

1696
01:25:04,633 --> 01:25:07,973
Will this do?

1697
01:25:07,970 --> 01:25:14,980
Spencer: Absolutely. Absolutely.

1698
01:25:14,977 --> 01:25:17,277
Guys you have no idea the
work I can do with these.

1699
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:21,880
Come on in. (kisses them)
Come on in you guys.

1700
01:25:21,884 --> 01:25:25,024
You guys. Okay, I
got to get them home.

1701
01:25:25,020 --> 01:25:26,620
Get them on ice ASAP.

1702
01:25:26,622 --> 01:25:31,832
(Music - birds singing)

1703
01:25:31,827 --> 01:25:33,257
Kamal: Sure you don't
need me to stay?

1704
01:25:33,262 --> 01:25:34,602
Drew: Oh no, it's
cool man, okay.

1705
01:25:34,597 --> 01:25:36,897
I think I can probably
handle it from here.

1706
01:25:36,899 --> 01:25:39,539
Thanks Kamal.

1707
01:25:39,535 --> 01:25:43,835
Kamal: Kam.

1708
01:25:43,839 --> 01:25:48,309
Drew: Good seeing you man.

1709
01:25:48,311 --> 01:25:49,681
Kamal: You too man.

1710
01:25:49,678 --> 01:25:52,878
Kamal: You did it.

1711
01:25:52,881 --> 01:25:57,091
Kamal: (sighs) It's time
for me to sell these knives.

1712
01:25:57,085 --> 01:25:59,915
Drew: (chuckles)
I know you will.

1713
01:25:59,922 --> 01:26:03,062
Kamal: Yeah, talk soon.

1714
01:26:03,058 --> 01:26:04,028
Drew: Yeah.

1715
01:26:04,026 --> 01:26:14,236
Kamal: [unintelligible]

1716
01:26:14,237 --> 01:26:19,707
Kamal: [unintelligible]

1717
01:26:19,708 --> 01:26:27,578
Drew: Oh! No!

1718
01:26:27,583 --> 01:26:29,083
Drew: I know it
all sounds crazy,

1719
01:26:29,084 --> 01:26:31,694
impossible even,
and if I were you

1720
01:26:31,687 --> 01:26:35,457
I'd have a hard time
believing it myself.

1721
01:26:35,458 --> 01:26:37,288
But I've changed from
this whole experience.

1722
01:26:37,293 --> 01:26:39,533
I really have.

1723
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:43,728
At one time in my
life, back home maybe,

1724
01:26:43,732 --> 01:26:46,132
you could say I was
only a caterpillar

1725
01:26:46,134 --> 01:26:49,274
and on my journey
here I was in a cocoon

1726
01:26:49,272 --> 01:26:53,712
and I now I can confidently
say the cocoon has hatched.

1727
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:57,779
I am now a butterfly.

1728
01:26:57,780 --> 01:27:01,120
A beautiful and fully
developed butterfly

1729
01:27:01,116 --> 01:27:02,616
that's ready to fly

1730
01:27:02,618 --> 01:27:05,988
and at the end of the day

1731
01:27:05,988 --> 01:27:10,658
I need [unintelligible]

1732
01:27:10,659 --> 01:27:15,829
so thank you Lance.

1733
01:27:15,831 --> 01:27:17,931
Your kind generosity
is what allowed me

1734
01:27:17,933 --> 01:27:19,973
to escape my sad,
unfulfilled existence,

1735
01:27:19,968 --> 01:27:21,998
one previously
destined for solitude,

1736
01:27:22,004 --> 01:27:24,214
a collision course, if you will,

1737
01:27:24,206 --> 01:27:26,336
threatened by peril and torture.

1738
01:27:26,342 --> 01:27:28,512
It's because of
you that my world

1739
01:27:28,511 --> 01:27:30,251
is suddenly wide open
with opportunity,

1740
01:27:30,245 --> 01:27:32,675
opportunity and freedom,

1741
01:27:32,681 --> 01:27:35,281
freedom from the
chains that bind me.

1742
01:27:35,284 --> 01:27:38,024
Like 911, I will never forget,

1743
01:27:38,020 --> 01:27:40,820
never forget what
you have done for me.

1744
01:27:40,823 --> 01:27:43,133
I know it isn't much,

1745
01:27:43,125 --> 01:27:46,395
but please in my
[unintelligible] accept my bag,

1746
01:27:46,395 --> 01:27:48,555
and the contents
within as a token

1747
01:27:48,564 --> 01:27:50,434
of my appreciation.

1748
01:27:50,433 --> 01:27:53,373
I feel like even
though they're not me

1749
01:27:53,369 --> 01:27:56,569
they'll be able to
adequately comfort you

1750
01:27:56,572 --> 01:27:58,572
while I explore this country

1751
01:27:58,574 --> 01:28:00,784
as I was meant to explore it.

1752
01:28:00,776 --> 01:28:02,606
Farewell for now Lance.

1753
01:28:02,611 --> 01:28:04,711
You'll forever be in my heart.

1754
01:28:04,713 --> 01:28:10,423
Love always, Katrina.

1755
01:28:10,419 --> 01:28:12,149
Spencer: Fuck.

1756
01:28:12,154 --> 01:28:15,694
Drew: You know I hate to say it,

1757
01:28:15,691 --> 01:28:17,361
but it's probably for the best

1758
01:28:17,360 --> 01:28:19,360
you weren't here
when she stopped by.

1759
01:28:19,362 --> 01:28:22,432
Spencer: You said she was
here for five minutes. Huh?

1760
01:28:22,431 --> 01:28:24,171
Drew: Yeah, yeah,
just long enough

1761
01:28:24,166 --> 01:28:26,336
to give me the letter
and the suitcase.

1762
01:28:26,335 --> 01:28:32,035
Spencer: Just hope she
finds whatever it is

1763
01:28:32,040 --> 01:28:34,210
she's looking for.

1764
01:28:34,209 --> 01:28:36,209
Drew: Yeah.

1765
01:28:36,211 --> 01:28:38,081
Spencer: Why don't you
come on by tomorrow?

1766
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:40,580
We'll talk about what it is

1767
01:28:40,583 --> 01:28:42,593
you're going to do
for me full-time.

1768
01:28:42,585 --> 01:28:46,215
Because Team Lance
could use a reliable

1769
01:28:46,221 --> 01:28:48,061
mother fucker like you Drew.

1770
01:28:48,056 --> 01:28:54,556
Drew: (sighs) Thank
you Mr. Bryant.

1771
01:28:54,563 --> 01:28:58,603
Uh, I really
appreciate that, I do.

1772
01:28:58,601 --> 01:29:02,201
Uh, but I think I'm
going to ride it out

1773
01:29:02,204 --> 01:29:05,174
at the furniture store a
while longer, you know.

1774
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:07,243
Spencer: You're not
even curious about what

1775
01:29:07,242 --> 01:29:10,182
you would be doing or what
Team Lance is all about.

1776
01:29:10,178 --> 01:29:13,348
Drew: I've got a pretty
good thing going right now.

1777
01:29:13,348 --> 01:29:16,518
I don't need to jump ship
for another one quite yet.

1778
01:29:16,519 --> 01:29:24,029
Spencer: Okay Drew.
You're all right.

1779
01:29:24,026 --> 01:29:30,896
I mean you're a
reasonable mother fucker.

1780
01:29:30,899 --> 01:29:34,369
Hear what I'm saying?

1781
01:29:34,369 --> 01:29:37,439
(Music)
