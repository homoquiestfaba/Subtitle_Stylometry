8
00:00:31,173 --> 00:00:32,652
This city's gone absolutely nuts.

9
00:00:32,813 --> 00:00:35,043
I tried flowers.
Maybe I should get something else.

10
00:00:35,213 --> 00:00:37,283
Everywhere you go,
you hear about the Trickster.

11
00:00:37,453 --> 00:00:40,331
Sabrina bitches how I work all the time.
So we go out, right?

12
00:00:40,493 --> 00:00:42,961
Bump into an ex-girlfriend,
now she thinks I'm cheating.

13
00:00:43,133 --> 00:00:45,522
Today begins the trial
of James Montgomery Jessie.

14
00:00:45,693 --> 00:00:47,763
A multiple personality wanted
for murder...

15
00:00:47,933 --> 00:00:50,572
...Jessie adopted the persona
of the costumed psychopath...

16
00:00:50,733 --> 00:00:54,043
...known as the Trickster. His days
of violent mayhem in Central City...

17
00:00:54,213 --> 00:00:56,681
...were ended
by fem private eye Megan Lockhart.

18
00:01:14,573 --> 00:01:18,407
Accept no substitutes,
ladies and gentlemen.

19
00:01:18,573 --> 00:01:20,882
I am the genuine article.

20
00:01:21,293 --> 00:01:26,003
I'm gonna make this city very sorry
it ever crossed me.

21
00:01:27,253 --> 00:01:29,448
Well, Barry Allen.

22
00:01:30,333 --> 00:01:32,210
I'm gonna make you pay too, Allen.

23
00:01:32,373 --> 00:01:34,933
You and your little cupcake girlfriend,
Megan Lockhart.

24
00:01:35,093 --> 00:01:37,971
And the Flash, the big red freak...

25
00:01:38,133 --> 00:01:41,284
...he'll pay the going rate
10 times over...

26
00:01:41,453 --> 00:01:44,525
...because nobody tricks the Trickster.

27
00:01:44,693 --> 00:01:46,365
Nobody!

FLASH 1x22 "THE TRIAL OF THE TRICKSTER"
Subtitles subXpacio and TusSeries

29
00:02:51,373 --> 00:02:54,843
The last time we pulled this kind of duty
was at that concert at Crystal Beach.

30
00:02:55,013 --> 00:02:57,811
No kidding. I hear they're scalping tickets
for seats outside.

31
00:02:57,973 --> 00:03:00,692
They're welcome to mine.
There's lots of places I'd rather be.

32
00:03:00,853 --> 00:03:03,287
Don't worry, there's no way
the Trickster's gonna walk.

33
00:03:03,453 --> 00:03:07,412
I'm not so sure. He's got this hotshot
lawyer defending him, Denise Cowan.

34
00:03:07,573 --> 00:03:08,562
Cowan?

35
00:03:08,813 --> 00:03:10,769
Didn't she get that Wall Street guy
acquitted of murder?

36
00:03:10,933 --> 00:03:14,846
- And they had videotapes of him doing it.
- Well, I'm glad I got front-row seats.

37
00:03:15,613 --> 00:03:17,808
Well, at least Megan
will be back in town.

38
00:03:17,973 --> 00:03:20,043
I just want to testify
and get out of here.

39
00:03:20,213 --> 00:03:23,649
- I don't think it's gonna be that easy.
- Barry Allen.

40
00:03:23,813 --> 00:03:26,885
You were nearly drowned by the Trickster
because of your involvement...

41
00:03:27,053 --> 00:03:29,123
...with private eye Megan Lockhart.
Any comment?

42
00:03:29,293 --> 00:03:31,329
- No.
- Are you gonna stand in the way...

43
00:03:31,493 --> 00:03:33,927
...of journalist inquiry,
of the people's right to know?

44
00:03:34,093 --> 00:03:36,448
- It's un-American.
- Kline, you're making me nauseous.

45
00:03:36,613 --> 00:03:38,843
Hey, Bar, if you don't tell
your side of things...

46
00:03:39,013 --> 00:03:41,481
...Kline will put words in your mouth.
It's self-defense.

47
00:03:41,653 --> 00:03:43,245
Come on, Bar.

48
00:03:44,053 --> 00:03:47,807
Well, it all came to a head
in the prop warehouse.

49
00:03:47,973 --> 00:03:50,851
- Where Jessie knocked me out-
- Forget about him. There she is!

50
00:03:51,013 --> 00:03:52,207
Megan Lockhart.

51
00:03:52,373 --> 00:03:56,127
The detective responsible for bringing the
Trickster to justice. She was kidnapped...

52
00:03:56,293 --> 00:03:59,808
...and forced to wear the costume
of the Trickster's fantasy sidekick, Prank.

53
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:02,806
How does it feel to be the woman
who stole the Trickster's heart?

54
00:04:02,973 --> 00:04:04,122
I didn't steal anything.

55
00:04:04,293 --> 00:04:07,683
It just kept coming gift-wrapped COD.
And I had help taking Jessie down-

56
00:04:07,853 --> 00:04:10,925
There must have been something
to make the Trickster so hot to trot.

57
00:04:11,093 --> 00:04:14,130
- How far did you go to get your man?
- You have got to be kidding me.

58
00:04:14,293 --> 00:04:15,726
I never kid, babe.

59
00:04:15,893 --> 00:04:18,532
Look, I'll try to squeeze you all in, okay?

60
00:04:18,693 --> 00:04:20,888
- Think you can squeeze me in?
- Get in line, fella.

61
00:04:21,053 --> 00:04:22,247
Megan.

62
00:04:22,853 --> 00:04:25,492
Barry. Hi!

63
00:04:25,653 --> 00:04:29,646
- You look great. I've never seen you-
- Oh, my secretary again.

64
00:04:29,813 --> 00:04:32,043
- You have a secretary now?
- It has been insane...

65
00:04:32,213 --> 00:04:35,444
...since we brought the Trickster in.
I have been turning down clients.

66
00:04:35,613 --> 00:04:38,446
Which is why I haven't written lately,
and I'm really sorry.

67
00:04:38,813 --> 00:04:41,247
Can this reunion take five,
because we have a deadline.

68
00:04:41,413 --> 00:04:43,085
- Thank you.
- Later, boys.

69
00:04:43,253 --> 00:04:45,972
We'll have time for pictures
and statements after the hearing.

70
00:04:46,133 --> 00:04:49,011
- Look, just get- Megan-
- I'll see you inside.

71
00:04:49,173 --> 00:04:51,562
- on how this case is going to shape up?
- Excuse me.

72
00:04:51,733 --> 00:04:53,803
Ma'am, being that it's just kicking off...

73
00:04:53,973 --> 00:04:56,123
Not quite the reunion I'd imagined.

74
00:04:57,253 --> 00:04:58,971
You have to-
You have to let me in.

75
00:04:59,133 --> 00:05:01,772
You just have to.
I'm carrying the Trickster's child.

76
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:05,403
You're just gonna have to carry him
right back where you came from, lady.

77
00:05:06,813 --> 00:05:09,008
You call this a trial?

78
00:05:09,173 --> 00:05:13,007
This is nothing more than a kangaroo
court without the hoppy, furry guy.

79
00:05:13,173 --> 00:05:15,403
- Order, order!
- If I were behind the bench, maybe-

80
00:05:15,573 --> 00:05:16,688
Jessie, please!

81
00:05:16,853 --> 00:05:19,765
Ms. Cowan, if you cannot control
your client...

82
00:05:19,933 --> 00:05:22,288
- ...I'm gonna have him restrained.
- Restrained?

83
00:05:22,453 --> 00:05:24,444
What do you call these,
costume jewelry?

84
00:05:24,613 --> 00:05:25,966
Jessie, shut up!

85
00:05:26,213 --> 00:05:29,250
It's bad enough you insist on wearing
this ridiculous outfit in court.

86
00:05:29,413 --> 00:05:31,005
Don't blow this for both of us.

87
00:05:31,253 --> 00:05:34,006
What, and disappoint my loyal fans?

88
00:05:34,173 --> 00:05:37,051
You don't have loyal fans.
The only person on your side is me!

89
00:05:37,453 --> 00:05:40,013
And that's starting to look like
a real bad career move.

90
00:05:40,253 --> 00:05:42,767
Your Honor, defense requests
a change of venue.

91
00:05:42,933 --> 00:05:45,049
- Are you nuts?
- I see no way that my client...

92
00:05:45,213 --> 00:05:48,489
- ... can get a fair trial in Central City.
- Leave Central City?

93
00:05:48,653 --> 00:05:52,043
You are crazy. I love this town.

94
00:05:52,253 --> 00:05:54,130
And it loves me.
Look what I've done for it.

95
00:05:54,333 --> 00:05:55,527
Your Honor.

96
00:05:55,733 --> 00:05:58,042
That is it.
You are in contempt of this court.

97
00:05:58,213 --> 00:06:01,967
No! I'll tell you who's in contempt.
This courtroom is in contempt.

98
00:06:02,133 --> 00:06:04,601
The entire judicial system
is in contempt.

99
00:06:04,773 --> 00:06:07,241
North America, the land mass,
is in contempt.

100
00:06:07,413 --> 00:06:10,485
Jessie, get a grip! You're losing it!

101
00:06:10,653 --> 00:06:13,087
I'm perfectly sane.

102
00:06:13,253 --> 00:06:16,290
I am the Trickster.

103
00:06:16,773 --> 00:06:18,252
And you!

104
00:06:19,093 --> 00:06:22,688
Pretending to be Prank
when you were never my loyal sidekick.

105
00:06:22,853 --> 00:06:24,206
Bailiff!

106
00:06:24,373 --> 00:06:27,012
This is all your fault!

107
00:06:29,053 --> 00:06:31,806
You're getting to be a drag, Jessie.

108
00:06:32,733 --> 00:06:34,849
And I am bored stiff.

109
00:06:43,933 --> 00:06:45,810
Megan attacked The Trickster.
He's down.

110
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:49,170
If I don't get complete silence,
I'm going to empty this courtroom.

111
00:06:49,333 --> 00:06:52,723
I'm gonna wave bail
pending psychiatric evaluation.

112
00:06:53,053 --> 00:06:56,568
This court is recessed
until 9 a. m. Monday morning.

113
00:06:57,653 --> 00:06:58,722
Get him out of here!

114
00:06:58,893 --> 00:07:00,770
A few questions
for the people out there-

115
00:07:00,933 --> 00:07:04,448
- I'm sorry, not now. I'm sorry.
- He's too good for you, tramp!

116
00:07:05,853 --> 00:07:08,890
- No, not now, really.
- Megan!

117
00:07:10,173 --> 00:07:12,084
With Jessie in custody
and Megan in town...

118
00:07:12,253 --> 00:07:14,244
...no one's talking
about the Flash anymore.

119
00:07:14,413 --> 00:07:15,812
I'm not sure I like that.

120
00:07:15,973 --> 00:07:19,602
- Joe Kline would kill for an interview.
- I don't want attention that much.

121
00:07:20,373 --> 00:07:23,683
- Would you like another?
- No. Thanks.

122
00:07:24,933 --> 00:07:27,493
- It's funny, don't you think?
- What?

123
00:07:27,693 --> 00:07:30,651
A year ago, you came to me
wanting to get rid of these powers.

124
00:07:30,813 --> 00:07:34,647
Who'd have thought we'd be sitting here
now, talking about the Flash's publicity?

125
00:07:34,813 --> 00:07:37,611
Well, one thing hasn't changed.
I'm still a bottomless pit.

126
00:07:37,813 --> 00:07:41,408
In the last year, I've gone near bust
on food alone.

127
00:07:43,493 --> 00:07:46,451
Thanks. I'm lying to everyone I know
about my nights.

128
00:07:46,613 --> 00:07:50,128
But, Barry, look at the good you've done.
You stopped the Trickster's rampage.

129
00:07:50,293 --> 00:07:53,729
Well, I think I'm a little fed up
with my own multiple personality.

130
00:07:54,373 --> 00:07:57,410
Maybe I'll go public.
Make us both famous.

131
00:07:57,613 --> 00:08:00,446
I and my faithful
and beautiful companion...

132
00:08:00,613 --> 00:08:03,081
...Christina McGee, am in reality-
Megan.

133
00:08:03,253 --> 00:08:05,244
Barry, Tina.

134
00:08:05,773 --> 00:08:06,922
Small town, huh?

135
00:08:07,093 --> 00:08:10,608
I saw you on the news.
I wish I had my autograph book on me.

136
00:08:10,853 --> 00:08:13,572
- You really charmed the press.
- I'm sorry about that, Barry.

137
00:08:13,733 --> 00:08:17,521
- But they just won't leave me alone.
- Well, when are we getting together?

138
00:08:17,693 --> 00:08:20,127
You know, I really wish I could say,
but I am buried.

139
00:08:20,293 --> 00:08:22,045
I- I'm meeting my agent for a drink.

140
00:08:22,213 --> 00:08:24,773
Your agent? This is a new you.

141
00:08:24,933 --> 00:08:27,128
I'm getting book and movie offers
out of nowhere.

142
00:08:27,293 --> 00:08:29,887
As soon as things lighten up,
I promise we'll get together.

143
00:08:30,173 --> 00:08:32,926
- Yeah. I'll check my schedule.
- Great.

144
00:08:33,973 --> 00:08:37,648
I've gotta go. I'm busy too, you know.

145
00:08:38,453 --> 00:08:39,647
What's that about, McGee?

146
00:08:40,213 --> 00:08:44,604
Megan, for a detective, sometimes
you miss some pretty big clues.

147
00:08:47,933 --> 00:08:50,322
I've already told you, counselor.

148
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:53,764
No. No. No!

149
00:08:53,933 --> 00:08:56,572
Damn it, Jessie. You are going
to have to listen to me...

150
00:08:56,733 --> 00:08:59,805
...and follow my lead, or you can kiss
any hope of acquittal goodbye.

151
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:02,441
So who the hell needs you anyway?

152
00:09:02,613 --> 00:09:04,888
I've got law degrees too, you know.

153
00:09:05,173 --> 00:09:08,370
- A whole trunk full of them.
- Mail call.

154
00:09:08,573 --> 00:09:12,122
You're some lucky guy, Tricksy.
You've got a secret admirer.

155
00:09:12,293 --> 00:09:15,842
Yep. And one who's dead set on using up
all the cheap perfume in town.

156
00:09:16,013 --> 00:09:18,447
Is this the police department's
idea of a joke?

157
00:09:18,613 --> 00:09:21,081
No. These were delivered
by a bona fide representative...

158
00:09:21,253 --> 00:09:22,925
...of the U.S. Post Office.

159
00:09:23,573 --> 00:09:25,529
Oh, boy. This is disgusting.

160
00:09:27,653 --> 00:09:31,089
- She's crazy about me.
- Yeah, well, you're half right anyway.

161
00:09:31,493 --> 00:09:34,371
Counselor, visiting hours are over.

162
00:09:35,933 --> 00:09:40,370
- Jessie, remember what I said.
- Yeah, yeah.

163
00:09:40,733 --> 00:09:42,451
Maybe I should be
defending myself.

164
00:09:43,133 --> 00:09:45,089
Don't be a fool.

165
00:09:45,853 --> 00:09:47,411
I can't help it.

166
00:10:29,733 --> 00:10:33,726
"I'll get you out. Prank."

167
00:10:35,333 --> 00:10:37,085
Prank?

168
00:10:44,453 --> 00:10:47,968
- You brought Sabrina here on a date?
- Well, at least I'll be seen with her.

169
00:10:48,133 --> 00:10:50,283
Maybe we'll run into one
of his other old flames.

170
00:10:50,453 --> 00:10:52,125
Look, I keep telling you, Sabrina.

171
00:10:52,293 --> 00:10:54,966
Baby, Jinx and I are old news.

172
00:10:55,133 --> 00:10:56,930
- Jinx?
- When I walked into that club...

173
00:10:57,093 --> 00:11:00,529
- ...she was all over him like a cheap suit.
- You had a girlfriend named Jinx?

174
00:11:00,693 --> 00:11:02,331
Oh, what's in a name?

175
00:11:05,613 --> 00:11:07,046
Mr. Jessie.

176
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:11,326
You understand that another outburst
like Friday's will not be tolerated.

177
00:11:13,453 --> 00:11:16,843
Your Honor, before we begin, my client
would like to address the court.

178
00:11:17,933 --> 00:11:20,925
- If the people have no objection.
- The people have no objection.

179
00:11:24,013 --> 00:11:25,765
Your Honor...

180
00:11:26,133 --> 00:11:30,570
...you can't imagine how sorry I am
for what I've done.

181
00:11:30,733 --> 00:11:32,803
But I am under the influence...

182
00:11:32,973 --> 00:11:36,602
...of demons inside me
battling for my very soul.

183
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:41,445
I swear to you, if I could have
stopped the killing, I would have.

184
00:11:41,613 --> 00:11:43,365
But I'm so weak.

185
00:11:44,573 --> 00:11:46,609
The others inside me...

186
00:11:47,253 --> 00:11:49,244
...are so strong.

187
00:11:49,693 --> 00:11:51,684
This is a load of-

188
00:11:52,933 --> 00:11:54,252
But I'm sorry.

189
00:11:55,413 --> 00:11:57,483
I'm really sorry.

190
00:11:58,253 --> 00:12:00,642
Your Honor, my client can't...

191
00:12:06,093 --> 00:12:08,163
What the hell is that?

192
00:12:10,293 --> 00:12:12,807
I will not have my courtroom
turned into a circus.

193
00:12:13,013 --> 00:12:15,481
Bailiff, get rid of that teddy bear!

194
00:12:35,173 --> 00:12:36,652
Laughing gas.

195
00:12:42,653 --> 00:12:44,245
You can't go.

196
00:12:45,693 --> 00:12:49,129
- You're gonna blow this case.
- Whose side are you on anyway?

197
00:12:52,253 --> 00:12:54,164
Sacrificing yourself for a lawyer?

198
00:12:56,013 --> 00:12:59,449
- Time to rethink your priorities, bub.
- No time. Let's go.

199
00:13:24,213 --> 00:13:27,683
- He's gone.
- No, not again.

200
00:13:27,853 --> 00:13:29,172
What happened in there?

201
00:13:30,293 --> 00:13:34,002
I'm sorry. Please, just try the pound.
I'm sure they'll be able to find-

202
00:13:34,173 --> 00:13:35,925
- Mendez!
- Yes, lieutenant.

203
00:13:36,093 --> 00:13:39,051
I want everything on Jessie's
love letters from his secret admirer.

204
00:13:39,213 --> 00:13:42,285
- Chemical analysis, the works.
- I'm on the way.

205
00:13:42,573 --> 00:13:45,041
You. I want you to get ahold
of your girlfriend.

206
00:13:45,213 --> 00:13:47,488
This time, she gets police protection.

207
00:13:47,653 --> 00:13:51,646
Jessie's got a better shot at getting
to Megan these days than I do.

208
00:13:58,733 --> 00:14:02,851
- Here we are. Home sweet home.
- Home?

209
00:14:10,893 --> 00:14:12,963
After Daddy died,
I moved out of the estate...

210
00:14:13,133 --> 00:14:15,363
...and into the apartments
here on the top floor.

211
00:14:15,533 --> 00:14:17,728
Zoey Clark.

212
00:14:17,893 --> 00:14:22,284
Clarx Toys' Clark. I love your stuff!

213
00:14:22,973 --> 00:14:25,692
GI Johnny, OMA.

214
00:14:25,853 --> 00:14:28,321
- One Man Army
- One Man Army

215
00:14:30,293 --> 00:14:35,686
When I saw you on TV,
I knew I had found a kindred spirit.

216
00:14:36,533 --> 00:14:38,444
No one gets you...

217
00:14:38,613 --> 00:14:40,205
...but me.

218
00:14:42,293 --> 00:14:48,004
I've spent my entire life looking
for bigger and bigger kicks.

219
00:14:52,493 --> 00:14:54,723
Weeklong parties...

220
00:14:55,693 --> 00:14:57,445
...joy riding...

221
00:14:58,093 --> 00:14:59,765
...shoplifting...

222
00:15:00,453 --> 00:15:04,082
...burglary, arson...

223
00:15:04,533 --> 00:15:06,285
...grand theft.

224
00:15:07,253 --> 00:15:09,084
An impressive résumé.

225
00:15:09,253 --> 00:15:13,929
And you are the ultimate thrill.

226
00:15:14,133 --> 00:15:16,283
There's no denying that.

227
00:15:16,933 --> 00:15:20,130
I can't believe I finally got
the Trickster.

228
00:15:20,933 --> 00:15:22,651
Forget the Trickster.

229
00:15:22,813 --> 00:15:24,292
He's old news.

230
00:15:24,493 --> 00:15:26,563
Perhaps next time I'll become...

231
00:15:29,893 --> 00:15:33,408
...Vladimir Jessinsky,
concert pianist, da?

232
00:15:34,693 --> 00:15:37,082
Forget Vladimir!

233
00:15:37,573 --> 00:15:39,484
I want the Trickster.

234
00:15:39,933 --> 00:15:43,642
That tramp Megan Lockhart
never deserved to wear this.

235
00:15:44,573 --> 00:15:46,325
But I do.

236
00:15:51,013 --> 00:15:54,244
Aren't you glad to see
your little sidekick, Prank?

237
00:15:55,613 --> 00:15:57,410
Prank.

238
00:15:58,533 --> 00:16:01,730
Prank! Prank?

239
00:16:02,093 --> 00:16:04,766
Yeah, baby, it's Prank.

240
00:16:05,293 --> 00:16:07,523
And you're the Trickster.

241
00:16:08,013 --> 00:16:09,844
Trickster.

242
00:16:14,893 --> 00:16:16,451
Prank.

243
00:16:17,093 --> 00:16:19,687
Thank heaven you got here in time.

244
00:16:19,853 --> 00:16:22,890
Oh, Trickster, you're the best.

245
00:16:23,173 --> 00:16:26,688
Forget the mushy stuff.
There is so much I have to do.

246
00:16:26,853 --> 00:16:28,650
And I won't make
the same mistakes twice.

247
00:16:28,813 --> 00:16:31,043
Whatever you need, I can get for you.

248
00:16:31,853 --> 00:16:34,367
- Anything?
- Anything.

249
00:16:40,053 --> 00:16:44,444
I have always wanted one of these.

250
00:16:49,173 --> 00:16:50,811
Perfect!

251
00:16:50,973 --> 00:16:55,046
The gall of this third-rate metropolis,
putting me on trial.

252
00:16:56,293 --> 00:16:58,568
I'd do anything for you, Trickster.
Anything.

253
00:16:58,733 --> 00:17:02,442
It's time we made
that red-suited goon pay.

254
00:17:02,613 --> 00:17:04,410
And Megan too.

255
00:17:04,613 --> 00:17:08,526
This time I take no prisoners...

256
00:17:08,693 --> 00:17:11,810
...and post no bills.

257
00:17:13,773 --> 00:17:17,652
Guess what, Central City,
the Trickster's back.

258
00:17:18,053 --> 00:17:20,362
And I've got him.

259
00:17:24,093 --> 00:17:29,087
Don, can this not wait till I get back?
Wait. Just hold on one second. Hello?

260
00:17:29,253 --> 00:17:31,642
Danny, I told you, quit bugging me.

261
00:17:31,813 --> 00:17:34,964
Hello? Yeah, Paul, I need
to speak with you. Hold on.

262
00:17:35,173 --> 00:17:38,210
Hello? Don, I'll get back to you.
Okay.

263
00:17:39,253 --> 00:17:41,972
Melanie, where is that package
I asked you for?

264
00:17:43,453 --> 00:17:46,047
- This must have cost a bundle.
- Comped by the hotel.

265
00:17:46,213 --> 00:17:50,809
Yeah, Paul. I got that fax you sent me,
and the terms are totally unacceptable.

266
00:17:52,773 --> 00:17:56,004
Hold all of Ms. Lockhart's calls, please.
Thank you.

267
00:17:56,173 --> 00:17:59,245
- Hey, what's the big idea?
- All I've gotten from you is a busy signal.

268
00:17:59,413 --> 00:18:01,802
I am trying to handle
the agency in San Francisco...

269
00:18:01,973 --> 00:18:04,533
- ...and juggle the media at the same time.
- I'm delighted.

270
00:18:04,693 --> 00:18:06,809
You've got a bigger problem
than your career.

271
00:18:07,013 --> 00:18:09,402
The Trickster? Don't I know it.

272
00:18:09,693 --> 00:18:12,412
This came for me special delivery
this afternoon.

273
00:18:12,573 --> 00:18:15,963
And you opened it without calling
the bomb squad or me?

274
00:18:16,133 --> 00:18:19,648
Relax, Barry, I'm a pro. I made sure
it wasn't a bomb. Check it out.

275
00:18:21,013 --> 00:18:22,765
Dead rat?

276
00:18:23,973 --> 00:18:26,043
"Some discoloration
may occur after dying.

277
00:18:26,253 --> 00:18:29,290
Love, the Trickster.
P.S., give my best to the Flash."

278
00:18:29,453 --> 00:18:32,047
- Cute, huh?
- We'll get you round-the-clock protection.

279
00:18:32,213 --> 00:18:34,283
I have all the protection I need,
thank you.

280
00:18:34,453 --> 00:18:36,921
Megan, save the Sam Spade crap
for the press, all right?

281
00:18:37,093 --> 00:18:40,369
- Jessie almost killed both of us.
- Barry, I can handle this.

282
00:18:40,533 --> 00:18:42,524
Oh, so you don't want me around.

283
00:18:42,893 --> 00:18:45,009
Actually, I've given it a lot of thought.

284
00:18:45,613 --> 00:18:47,524
How would you like to move
to San Francisco?

285
00:18:47,693 --> 00:18:49,923
- What?
- I mean, go into partnership with me...

286
00:18:50,093 --> 00:18:51,685
...in the agency.

287
00:18:51,853 --> 00:18:53,764
- The agency?
- Well, think about it, Barry.

288
00:18:53,933 --> 00:18:56,208
No more being stuck behind test tubes
in the lab.

289
00:18:56,373 --> 00:18:58,364
All the hyperspeed street work
you want.

290
00:18:58,533 --> 00:19:01,605
- Plus you get paid really well for it.
- I like those test tubes.

291
00:19:03,053 --> 00:19:07,524
Okay. Well, think about it.
Let me know.

292
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:12,365
So now on to Jessie. No offense, but
the cops don't seem to be getting results.

293
00:19:12,893 --> 00:19:16,806
Here's a list of possible hideouts.
Warehouses, theaters, amusement parks.

294
00:19:16,973 --> 00:19:19,885
You do the legwork,
and I'll track the phony stenographer.

295
00:19:20,333 --> 00:19:22,688
If I need to reach you, I'll call you.

296
00:19:24,573 --> 00:19:27,849
And I need a national check on
all female mental patient escapees.

297
00:19:28,013 --> 00:19:30,732
- You have better access at the station.
- I'm working for you?

298
00:19:31,933 --> 00:19:34,811
I figured if we're tracking the Trickster,
I should coordinate.

299
00:19:34,973 --> 00:19:36,167
You assume a lot.

300
00:19:38,933 --> 00:19:41,970
This has to do with the fact
that I left town, doesn't it?

301
00:19:45,613 --> 00:19:48,252
Look, Barry, I know we have
a lot to talk about.

302
00:19:48,413 --> 00:19:50,563
I'll find him myself.

303
00:19:54,893 --> 00:19:56,804
You did it again, Megan.

304
00:19:59,413 --> 00:20:01,324
Okay, ready in the booth.

305
00:20:01,773 --> 00:20:05,846
Ready on cameras. Four, three, two...

306
00:20:06,133 --> 00:20:09,170
- You're on the air.
- And we are back.

307
00:20:09,333 --> 00:20:11,289
So, what you're saying, babe...

308
00:20:11,453 --> 00:20:14,365
...is since your partner died,
things have just not been the same.

309
00:20:14,533 --> 00:20:18,970
Let's face it, babe, this dog pile of a city
refuses to recognize genius.

310
00:20:19,373 --> 00:20:22,524
Now let's cut to the chase
and get down to the heart of the matter.

311
00:20:22,693 --> 00:20:26,083
Come on, speed-o, let's forget about
the little Lockhart twist.

312
00:20:26,333 --> 00:20:29,803
We both know I'm gonna kill her
sooner or later. Unless I decide...

313
00:20:29,973 --> 00:20:32,203
Jessie, you are unbelievable.

314
00:20:33,133 --> 00:20:36,250
So I'm calling you out, babe.
Just you and me.

315
00:20:36,413 --> 00:20:39,689
The final showdown.
The Thriller in Manila.

316
00:20:40,173 --> 00:20:42,687
- She said what to you tonight?
- That woman aggravates me.

317
00:20:42,853 --> 00:20:45,287
- I don't work for her.
- At least she's mistreating you.

318
00:20:45,453 --> 00:20:47,523
Sabrina won't even talk to me.

319
00:20:47,693 --> 00:20:49,285
The Flash versus the Trickster...

320
00:20:49,453 --> 00:20:51,205
...in a final ground-pounding...

321
00:20:51,373 --> 00:20:54,843
...asphalt-churning, nitro-burning
duel of the titans.

322
00:20:55,013 --> 00:20:56,241
You know where, babe.

323
00:20:56,413 --> 00:21:00,167
It's time Central City started recognizing
its real heroes. You know what I mean?

324
00:21:00,333 --> 00:21:02,893
Good. Now get out of here.
I love you. You're beautiful.

325
00:21:03,053 --> 00:21:06,125
Does Kline need a new makeup man,
or what?

326
00:21:27,453 --> 00:21:28,932
Not now, babe.

327
00:21:43,973 --> 00:21:46,168
How reality stinks.

328
00:21:46,333 --> 00:21:49,131
That's why I try and improve on it
whenever I can.

329
00:21:50,573 --> 00:21:53,292
Well, what do you think?

330
00:21:54,293 --> 00:21:55,851
Not too subdued?

331
00:22:14,053 --> 00:22:15,532
Cheap harlot!

332
00:22:15,693 --> 00:22:17,604
Hey!

333
00:22:18,013 --> 00:22:20,004
Get them off me!

334
00:22:21,533 --> 00:22:23,205
Get them off me!

335
00:22:49,453 --> 00:22:52,365
- Who wants gum?
- I do. I do.

336
00:22:57,853 --> 00:23:01,892
- Are you okay?
- No. But go get them.

337
00:23:18,813 --> 00:23:24,331
You see, it's that little touch of epoxy
in the gum that does the trick.

338
00:23:26,013 --> 00:23:27,526
Shoes.

339
00:23:32,213 --> 00:23:33,771
Mallet.

340
00:23:39,613 --> 00:23:41,922
Are we gonna kill him?

341
00:23:42,093 --> 00:23:43,287
No.

342
00:23:43,453 --> 00:23:46,684
I have a much more interesting idea.

343
00:23:47,493 --> 00:23:49,484
Right, old buddy? Right.

344
00:24:08,373 --> 00:24:11,922
Good morning, sunshine!

345
00:24:12,173 --> 00:24:15,006
It's a beautiful day in my neighborhood.

346
00:24:15,573 --> 00:24:17,723
Won't you be my neighbor?

347
00:24:18,373 --> 00:24:20,933
- Stop it, Jessie.
- The Trickster to you.

348
00:24:21,373 --> 00:24:23,284
And I'm Prank.

349
00:24:23,853 --> 00:24:27,129
- I thought Megan was Prank.
- I'm Prank! Me!

350
00:24:27,293 --> 00:24:29,807
And don't you forget it.

351
00:24:32,133 --> 00:24:35,170
- But don't you wanna see who-?
- He is the mask.

352
00:24:35,413 --> 00:24:39,167
Without the mask, he's nothing.
Bupkes, nada, zip.

353
00:24:39,333 --> 00:24:45,090
Just some boring, average,
insignificant jerk nobody cares about...

354
00:24:45,293 --> 00:24:47,204
...who'll die alone and forgotten...

355
00:24:47,373 --> 00:24:52,049
...watching game shows in
an empty apartment with cats.

356
00:24:52,213 --> 00:24:55,444
So you touch that mask again,
I'll murder you!

357
00:24:55,613 --> 00:24:57,171
Okay?

358
00:24:58,333 --> 00:24:59,891
Women.

359
00:25:00,213 --> 00:25:01,726
So, what are you gonna do, kill me?

360
00:25:02,333 --> 00:25:05,325
The last thing I want is you dead.

361
00:25:07,413 --> 00:25:11,770
With a little help, you'll come around
to my way of thinking.

362
00:25:21,253 --> 00:25:23,244
We're gonna have
so much fun together...

363
00:25:23,733 --> 00:25:25,485
...once I reprogram your brain.

364
00:25:49,053 --> 00:25:51,521
Come to me.

365
00:25:53,693 --> 00:25:56,491
Mine. Yes, you are.

366
00:25:58,213 --> 00:26:01,523
Come, Flash. Oh, Flashie-poo.

367
00:26:08,253 --> 00:26:13,771
Oh, stop it, stop it, stop it!
He is such a baby.

368
00:26:15,013 --> 00:26:17,766
- What are we gonna do now, Trickster?
- We?

369
00:26:17,973 --> 00:26:21,329
As in, you and me?
Hey, reality check, sweetie pie.

370
00:26:21,693 --> 00:26:27,682
You can't begin to understand
the depth and genius of my plans.

371
00:26:28,093 --> 00:26:30,891
Besides, it's guy stuff.

372
00:26:32,933 --> 00:26:37,051
I will make this bug house of a city
pay for the indignity...

373
00:26:37,213 --> 00:26:39,204
...it's laid at my feet...

374
00:26:39,373 --> 00:26:41,887
...with the help of you...

375
00:26:42,053 --> 00:26:44,089
...my pal...

376
00:26:44,573 --> 00:26:46,723
...the Flash.

377
00:26:50,253 --> 00:26:52,289
I blame myself, Tina.

378
00:26:52,453 --> 00:26:54,330
I blew it.

379
00:26:54,493 --> 00:26:57,291
I was so caught up in paperwork
and promotions, I lost my edge.

380
00:26:57,453 --> 00:27:00,251
Don't be silly. We're dealing
with a dangerous lunatic here...

381
00:27:00,413 --> 00:27:02,483
...who seems to be getting help
from this Prank.

382
00:27:02,653 --> 00:27:04,848
I'm so stupid. I mean, I care about Barry.

383
00:27:05,013 --> 00:27:07,288
And somehow we never even
got a chance to talk.

384
00:27:07,453 --> 00:27:09,489
And now Jessie's got him.

385
00:27:09,653 --> 00:27:12,247
He's got radios in those wings of his,
doesn't he?

386
00:27:12,413 --> 00:27:14,847
The transceivers proved too sensitive
for hyperspeed.

387
00:27:15,013 --> 00:27:18,449
- And Barry hated them anyway.
- Hated being on a leash, I bet.

388
00:27:19,733 --> 00:27:21,325
I could track his heat patterns.

389
00:27:21,533 --> 00:27:23,444
I'd have to tap into the satellite system.

390
00:27:23,613 --> 00:27:25,763
It would take time,
and it's not legal either.

391
00:27:25,933 --> 00:27:28,652
Maybe I should have offered you
the partnership.

392
00:27:28,813 --> 00:27:32,362
- Partnership?
- Tina, Barry is bigger than forensics.

393
00:27:32,533 --> 00:27:35,684
And I could really use his help
in San Francisco.

394
00:27:35,933 --> 00:27:39,528
- He's considering the offer?
- Besides you, what's keeping him here?

395
00:27:39,693 --> 00:27:41,923
Barry does not stay in Central City
on my account.

396
00:27:42,093 --> 00:27:44,323
We are just good friends.
It's not like that.

397
00:27:44,493 --> 00:27:49,169
Face it, McGee, you two are
a team, romantic or otherwise.

398
00:28:41,413 --> 00:28:44,246
Hey, dude, your hand is, like, smoking.

399
00:28:46,493 --> 00:28:48,051
Thanks, partner.

400
00:28:53,653 --> 00:28:55,848
That's enough. You're under arrest.

401
00:28:56,613 --> 00:28:59,446
You too, Flash. Don't move, or I'll shoot!

402
00:28:59,653 --> 00:29:01,609
What are you wearing?

403
00:29:02,813 --> 00:29:04,690
- Put it down.
- Come on. Come on.

404
00:29:07,413 --> 00:29:11,645
It's not guns that kill people,
it's these little hard things.

405
00:29:15,813 --> 00:29:18,850
Hey, partner, got a match?

406
00:29:19,333 --> 00:29:22,211
- Left them in my other suit.
- No problemo.

407
00:29:30,213 --> 00:29:33,888
Yes! Yes! Go! Go! Go!

408
00:29:38,373 --> 00:29:40,841
Too safe and too sane.

409
00:29:51,653 --> 00:29:53,564
Wrong one.

410
00:29:55,213 --> 00:29:57,568
Murph, come on. Come on, Murph!

411
00:29:59,093 --> 00:30:00,162
Murph!

412
00:30:06,693 --> 00:30:08,445
Beautiful.

413
00:30:08,973 --> 00:30:11,726
Wait till you see what else I got lined up.

414
00:30:11,893 --> 00:30:14,043
I love that guy.

415
00:30:15,173 --> 00:30:19,166
I can't believe it, Murph.
The Flash has gone bad.

416
00:30:28,013 --> 00:30:30,049
I thought you guys
were gonna wait for me.

417
00:30:30,213 --> 00:30:33,489
- We were having way too much fun.
- You got that right, partner.

418
00:30:33,653 --> 00:30:35,962
You said I could fire the candle.

419
00:30:36,133 --> 00:30:40,206
Whine, whine, whine.
You're getting to be a real drag.

420
00:30:40,493 --> 00:30:42,370
I've had enough of your mewling
and puking.

421
00:30:42,533 --> 00:30:45,093
Hey, forget about the ball and chain.
What next?

422
00:30:45,253 --> 00:30:50,691
Well, I figure we drop the little woman
off at home, then it's boys' night out.

423
00:30:52,413 --> 00:30:55,007
Yes, Madam Mayor,
I know he's fast.

424
00:30:55,293 --> 00:30:57,124
I don't know how.

425
00:30:57,293 --> 00:31:01,206
I promise you, I am doing everything
I can. Everything!

426
00:31:01,373 --> 00:31:05,082
Okay, the Flash and the Trickster have
defaced a children's mural at the Civic...

427
00:31:05,253 --> 00:31:08,609
...they let out the poisonous snakes
and dynamited the River Street Bridge.

428
00:31:08,773 --> 00:31:10,968
Traffic's backed up to the state line, sir.

429
00:31:11,813 --> 00:31:15,806
I have had better weeks. Roberts, I want
an APB on the Flash out on the wire now.

430
00:31:15,973 --> 00:31:18,692
You notify the SWAT team
we need heavy firepower.

431
00:31:18,853 --> 00:31:20,081
Come on, Murph.

432
00:31:20,253 --> 00:31:22,847
What? We dig a trench,
we put tar paper over it.

433
00:31:23,013 --> 00:31:25,129
The Flash hits that, boom,
we got him.

434
00:31:25,293 --> 00:31:28,410
Murphy, Bellows, how about earning
your pay and hitting the streets!

435
00:31:28,573 --> 00:31:30,529
- Yes, sir. I'm driving.
- Yes, sir!

436
00:31:30,973 --> 00:31:33,487
Hey, has anybody seen Barry?

437
00:31:40,613 --> 00:31:44,845
You and me, pal.
We'll make this city pay.

438
00:31:46,693 --> 00:31:49,890
They called us crazy,
drove us out on the streets...

439
00:31:50,053 --> 00:31:53,284
- Hey, this is great!
- They put us on trial.

440
00:31:53,813 --> 00:31:57,044
- Now we'll make them think twice.
- Hey...

441
00:31:57,213 --> 00:32:00,728
...I could vibrate my fingers
through somebody's brain.

442
00:32:01,373 --> 00:32:04,445
Gross. Well, maybe later.

443
00:32:04,613 --> 00:32:09,733
But seriously, we are gonna
put Central City on trial.

444
00:32:10,373 --> 00:32:13,046
I'm ready to paint this town red.

445
00:32:14,573 --> 00:32:16,848
Paint the town red!

446
00:32:18,653 --> 00:32:21,486
Believe it or not,
the Flash has joined the Trickster...

447
00:32:21,653 --> 00:32:23,962
...spreading violence and vandalism
through the city.

448
00:32:24,133 --> 00:32:26,203
Citizens have been asked
to stay off the street.

449
00:32:26,373 --> 00:32:28,933
The mayor is said to be requesting
the National Guard...

450
00:32:29,093 --> 00:32:30,367
...to quell this crime wave.

451
00:32:30,533 --> 00:32:33,047
Sorry, Al. The MAC 11 s,
did you trace them?

452
00:32:33,933 --> 00:32:36,970
Bought by DLC Corporation.

453
00:32:37,733 --> 00:32:40,452
A subsidiary of Clarx Toys.

454
00:32:41,173 --> 00:32:42,845
Thanks, Al.

455
00:32:44,733 --> 00:32:48,487
Everything the Trickster and this Prank nut
have used comes from Clarx Toys.

456
00:32:48,653 --> 00:32:50,132
How's your search going?

457
00:32:50,373 --> 00:32:53,331
Getting into the tracking system
is more difficult than I thought.

458
00:32:53,493 --> 00:32:56,405
But there's a bigger problem.
He's done something to Barry's mind.

459
00:32:56,573 --> 00:32:59,963
Maybe brainwashed him. When we do
find him, he won't be happy to see us.

460
00:33:00,213 --> 00:33:04,252
Oh, great. Not only are we up
against the Trickster, but the Flash too.

461
00:33:04,813 --> 00:33:05,848
If we're lucky...

462
00:33:06,093 --> 00:33:08,812
...the Trickster's programming
won't be anything but superficial.

463
00:33:08,973 --> 00:33:11,168
I think I can override it
with an Army technique:

464
00:33:11,373 --> 00:33:13,807
A shot of adrenaline
to countermand the programming.

465
00:33:14,733 --> 00:33:16,928
Good Lord, is there anything
you don't know?

466
00:33:17,333 --> 00:33:18,971
I wish I knew more.

467
00:33:19,133 --> 00:33:22,762
Because if this doesn't work,
Barry could die.

468
00:33:24,853 --> 00:33:27,048
I think we should visit our local
Clarx toy store.

469
00:33:50,213 --> 00:33:52,488
Well, if it isn't the girl from court.

470
00:33:52,653 --> 00:33:54,564
I'm not laughing now, babe.

471
00:33:54,893 --> 00:33:57,248
- Who are you?
- Prank.

472
00:33:57,653 --> 00:33:59,848
Your real name.

473
00:34:00,573 --> 00:34:02,086
- Zoey.
- Zoey what?

474
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:05,371
- Clark!
- Where's the Trickster?

475
00:34:05,533 --> 00:34:08,127
- I hope he's all right.
- After what he's done to you?

476
00:34:08,293 --> 00:34:09,931
Oh, brother.

477
00:34:10,173 --> 00:34:12,971
Let me clue you in, honey.
I am way more unstable than you...

478
00:34:13,133 --> 00:34:15,852
...so you better tell me where he is
right now.

479
00:34:17,973 --> 00:34:20,407
Don't tell him I told you.

480
00:34:22,653 --> 00:34:25,929
- He's putting the city on trial.
- Let's go, McGee.

481
00:34:32,813 --> 00:34:35,646
Forget about her.
We gotta get to the courthouse.

482
00:34:37,413 --> 00:34:41,804
The court of no recourse
is now in session.

483
00:34:41,973 --> 00:34:44,612
Could we have the theme, please?

484
00:34:50,013 --> 00:34:53,608
Will the accused come on down?

485
00:34:57,853 --> 00:34:59,605
All right, kill the music.

486
00:34:59,853 --> 00:35:01,844
What is the meaning of this outrage?

487
00:35:04,213 --> 00:35:05,805
Jessie.

488
00:35:06,973 --> 00:35:11,808
James, as your counsel, I strongly
advise you against taking this action.

489
00:35:11,973 --> 00:35:14,692
You're just like all the rest:

490
00:35:14,853 --> 00:35:19,563
Manipulative, faithless, self-serving.
No use to me at all.

491
00:35:19,733 --> 00:35:21,371
You're fired!

492
00:35:21,773 --> 00:35:23,286
Bailiff, read the charges.

493
00:35:26,173 --> 00:35:31,247
"Central City and you, its representatives,
are on trial for crimes against good taste."

494
00:35:31,493 --> 00:35:32,972
And me.

495
00:35:33,173 --> 00:35:36,961
- This is absurd!
- I'm sure I can get a continuance on this.

496
00:35:37,493 --> 00:35:41,486
Was I talking to you?
Has the jury reached a verdict?

497
00:35:42,493 --> 00:35:43,687
We have, Your Honor.

498
00:35:43,853 --> 00:35:45,809
Guilty. Guilty.

499
00:35:46,213 --> 00:35:48,568
Guilty. Guilty.

500
00:35:48,733 --> 00:35:52,009
Guilty. Guilty. Guilty. Guilty.

501
00:35:52,173 --> 00:35:54,926
Guilty. They're guilty! Guilty.

502
00:35:56,533 --> 00:35:58,171
Guilty.

503
00:35:58,333 --> 00:36:02,406
Any last words
before I pronounce sentence?

504
00:36:02,573 --> 00:36:05,041
And especially you!

505
00:36:05,413 --> 00:36:08,405
Speechless with contrition, eh?

506
00:36:08,573 --> 00:36:13,488
I find every last one of you guilty
as sin and sentence you to death.

507
00:36:13,653 --> 00:36:16,850
Are you prepared to carry out sentence,
Mr. Executioner?

508
00:36:17,133 --> 00:36:18,282
No.

509
00:36:20,293 --> 00:36:23,330
I can't decide which to use.

510
00:36:24,213 --> 00:36:27,888
Well, that's why they call me
the hanging judge.

511
00:36:42,213 --> 00:36:44,522
Well, what's stopping you, palomino?

512
00:36:45,573 --> 00:36:47,404
I can't move.

513
00:36:48,013 --> 00:36:50,083
An attack of conscience, eh?

514
00:36:50,533 --> 00:36:52,967
This had to be...

515
00:36:54,253 --> 00:36:56,050
...sooner or later.

516
00:36:59,613 --> 00:37:01,808
I'm taking you in for good
this time, Jessie.

517
00:37:02,133 --> 00:37:03,771
You never let us have any fun.

518
00:37:05,013 --> 00:37:07,652
You know who I am,
and I know you're not a killer.

519
00:37:07,813 --> 00:37:10,850
Of course you're a killer.
You're a freak of nature.

520
00:37:11,733 --> 00:37:13,325
You can do whatever you want...

521
00:37:13,493 --> 00:37:15,165
...because you can get away with it!

522
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:18,245
Don't do it, red.
You're better than that.

523
00:37:18,413 --> 00:37:20,768
You ruined everything!

524
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:26,444
Kill her!

525
00:37:26,893 --> 00:37:28,645
Kill her already!

526
00:37:31,813 --> 00:37:34,043
- You shot my partner!
- Barry, listen to me.

527
00:37:34,213 --> 00:37:37,603
The Trickster tried to kill you and Megan.
He is not your partner, I am.

528
00:37:37,773 --> 00:37:39,331
You know that!

529
00:37:40,013 --> 00:37:41,651
We've been through hell together.

530
00:37:41,813 --> 00:37:45,283
And I've always stood by you.
And I always will.

531
00:37:45,573 --> 00:37:47,564
For as long as you want me to.

532
00:37:50,013 --> 00:37:52,049
- Tina?
- Yeah.

533
00:37:53,453 --> 00:37:55,205
Tina.

534
00:38:04,333 --> 00:38:06,801
- Help!
- Jessie.

535
00:38:07,253 --> 00:38:08,368
Body armor.

536
00:38:08,533 --> 00:38:10,683
I'm not crazy, you know.

537
00:38:11,053 --> 00:38:12,372
I've got a bomb...

538
00:38:12,533 --> 00:38:14,012
...and I will use it.

539
00:38:17,613 --> 00:38:19,410
Let her go!

540
00:38:25,613 --> 00:38:28,446
Megan, go after Jessie. The Flash needs
a few seconds to recover.

541
00:38:28,613 --> 00:38:31,844
- Like hell I do.
- Relax. Tina rewired that scooter of his.

542
00:38:55,253 --> 00:38:56,891
Get in!

543
00:38:59,613 --> 00:39:01,683
I like it.

544
00:39:06,173 --> 00:39:09,006
- What is this?
- I had it made for you.

545
00:39:09,173 --> 00:39:11,733
It's the great Trickster escape mobile.

546
00:39:11,893 --> 00:39:15,647
For me? Gee, after I treated you
like dirt.

547
00:39:15,853 --> 00:39:17,650
Hung you out to dry.

548
00:39:18,413 --> 00:39:21,166
I love you madly.

549
00:39:21,333 --> 00:39:23,893
That's why I had it equipped
with all the options.

550
00:39:25,813 --> 00:39:29,772
Oh, darling, it won't work.
I'm no good for you.

551
00:39:29,933 --> 00:39:34,848
Besides, how can I miss you
when you won't go away?

552
00:39:49,413 --> 00:39:50,766
Good evening, my dear.

553
00:39:50,933 --> 00:39:54,403
I'm Officer Murphy,
and you are under arrest.

554
00:40:17,253 --> 00:40:18,652
Damn!

555
00:40:49,533 --> 00:40:51,091
Give it up, Jessie!

556
00:40:55,413 --> 00:40:58,246
Join me in hell.

557
00:41:34,453 --> 00:41:37,763
Where's the Flash
when you really need him?

558
00:41:37,933 --> 00:41:40,527
Might break me out of here.

559
00:41:41,773 --> 00:41:47,564
They think a padded cell can stop me.
How wrong they are.

560
00:41:47,733 --> 00:41:52,011
This will be my polyfoam fortress.

561
00:41:52,973 --> 00:41:57,489
They're in for such a big surprise.

562
00:41:57,853 --> 00:42:02,449
Because nobody tricks the Trickster.
Nobody!

563
00:42:10,453 --> 00:42:11,647
Thanks, Tina.

564
00:42:11,813 --> 00:42:15,123
If you hadn't shown up, I'd still be
running around in those crazy boots.

565
00:42:15,293 --> 00:42:16,612
What would I do without you?

566
00:42:16,773 --> 00:42:19,003
Oh, I don't know.
Supermarket openings maybe.

567
00:42:19,173 --> 00:42:20,652
Never.

568
00:42:21,053 --> 00:42:22,645
Wow, I wish I'd have been in court.

569
00:42:22,813 --> 00:42:25,566
No, you wanna stay far away
from guys like Jessie.

570
00:42:26,213 --> 00:42:27,885
- Hey, guys.
- Hi.

571
00:42:28,053 --> 00:42:31,125
- Caught them out in the hallway.
- Julio left the concert tickets here.

572
00:42:31,493 --> 00:42:33,404
Tickets? I thought you were breaking up.

573
00:42:33,773 --> 00:42:37,049
Well, we had a mature discussion
about the direction of our relationship.

574
00:42:37,213 --> 00:42:40,330
Yeah, he came back groveling
on his hands and knees.

575
00:42:40,493 --> 00:42:43,212
- We'd love to stay, but we got a date.
- Bye.

576
00:42:43,573 --> 00:42:46,041
Bet those two don't make it out
to the parking lot.

577
00:42:46,213 --> 00:42:49,285
- So you're off to San Francisco.
- Yeah.

578
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:51,251
We have way too many goodbyes.

579
00:42:51,413 --> 00:42:54,246
I left something burning at the lab.
I'll see you later.

580
00:42:54,413 --> 00:42:57,405
We make a great team, Lockhart.
See you around.

581
00:42:57,573 --> 00:42:59,450
Yeah, you too, McGee.

582
00:43:02,573 --> 00:43:05,690
She's great. I mean,
not your average science type.

583
00:43:05,853 --> 00:43:07,445
Tina's the best.

584
00:43:08,253 --> 00:43:10,448
Look, before I put my foot
in my mouth...

585
00:43:10,613 --> 00:43:12,365
...I think I owe you an apology.

586
00:43:12,533 --> 00:43:15,605
I've been a little preoccupied lately.

587
00:43:15,773 --> 00:43:17,968
- This I noticed.
- I'm really sorry, Barry.

588
00:43:18,133 --> 00:43:21,205
I've just been trying to keep my head
above water.

589
00:43:21,573 --> 00:43:24,963
So have you thought
about my offer?

590
00:43:25,533 --> 00:43:28,093
Megan, I would love to come
to San Francisco with you.

591
00:43:28,253 --> 00:43:32,246
- God, that's terrific! Great, Barry.
- But- But I can't.

592
00:43:32,733 --> 00:43:34,132
You can't?

593
00:43:34,293 --> 00:43:35,726
No.

594
00:43:36,093 --> 00:43:40,644
Central City's my home, you know?
My family is here. My friends are here.

595
00:43:42,013 --> 00:43:44,402
I'm just not ready to say goodbye.

596
00:43:46,373 --> 00:43:48,204
My loss.

597
00:43:49,213 --> 00:43:53,570
Well, I still have a few days
before I have to head back.

598
00:43:54,013 --> 00:43:56,083
Some of those long goodbyes.

599
00:43:56,253 --> 00:43:58,164
More goodbyes?

600
00:44:00,693 --> 00:44:03,491
Hey, Allen. We got work to do.
