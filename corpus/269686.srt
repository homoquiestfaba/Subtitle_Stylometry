00:01:46,973 --> 00:01:49,271
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

2
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:51,401
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

3
00:01:54,948 --> 00:01:57,212
Merry Christmas!

4
00:01:57,283 --> 00:01:59,547
Merry Christmas!

5
00:02:01,988 --> 00:02:05,947
Thank you, ma'am.
Merry Christmas!

6
00:02:06,059 --> 00:02:07,075
Thank you. Thank you.

7
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:08,092
Thank you. Thank you.

8
00:02:08,161 --> 00:02:12,222
Merry Christmas!
Ha ha, ho ho!

9
00:02:12,298 --> 00:02:14,858
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

10
00:02:16,936 --> 00:02:18,904
<i>Thank you, sir.</i>

11
00:02:18,972 --> 00:02:22,066
<i>And a merry Christmas
to you.</i>

12
00:02:22,142 --> 00:02:24,337
<i>Merry Christmas!</i>

13
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:38,252
Oh, boy.

14
00:02:43,096 --> 00:02:46,623
Shit. He's got kids.

15
00:02:46,699 --> 00:02:49,668
Dog, cat-- Shit.

16
00:02:49,736 --> 00:02:52,864
That's no good.
It's no good.

17
00:03:05,218 --> 00:03:07,584
l- l-l-l-l--

18
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:20,831
Bless me, Father,
for I have sinned.

19
00:03:20,900 --> 00:03:23,926
It has been two weeks
since my last confession.

20
00:03:24,003 --> 00:03:27,268
Is that Bill Firpo?

21
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:29,274
Uh, yes, Father.

22
00:03:29,342 --> 00:03:34,143
It's been five years since you've been to
confession. Is that how you're gonna start?

23
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:37,445
<i>- I'm sorry, Father.
- It's okay.</i>

24
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:42,284
<i>Father... I found a wallet
in the street.</i>

25
00:03:42,388 --> 00:03:44,515
Did you do
the right thing?

26
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:49,254
Well... yes, Father,
I did, eventually...

27
00:03:49,329 --> 00:03:52,196
with great difficulty.

28
00:03:52,265 --> 00:03:54,631
I dropped it in the mail.

29
00:03:54,701 --> 00:03:59,331
<i>It had over $800 in it, which I counted
many times on the subway.</i>

30
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:03,068
I feel as if I've ruined
my karma, Father...

31
00:04:03,142 --> 00:04:08,079
and that something bad is gonna happen
as a result of this transgression.

32
00:04:08,147 --> 00:04:11,014
How many letters is that?

33
00:04:11,084 --> 00:04:15,248
Transgression? Uh...
I don't know.

34
00:04:15,355 --> 00:04:18,347
Uh... 13. Why, Father?

35
00:04:18,458 --> 00:04:20,426
Never mind.

36
00:04:20,526 --> 00:04:23,689
<i>- Did you mail the wallet back?
- Yes.</i>

37
00:04:23,763 --> 00:04:29,668
I realized, uh... I'm really not that
much different than my two brothers.

38
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:32,227
I can easily
be led astray.

39
00:04:32,305 --> 00:04:37,675
- Speaking of which, have you seen tonight's paper?
- No. Why?

40
00:04:37,744 --> 00:04:41,339
<i>Well, according to the Post, they may
be home for the holidays.</i>

41
00:04:41,414 --> 00:04:45,316
No, that's not possible.
They're not up for parole until March.

42
00:04:45,385 --> 00:04:48,377
<i>According to this article,
because of overcrowding...</i>

43
00:04:48,454 --> 00:04:51,423
anyone who's eligible
for parole through June...

44
00:04:51,491 --> 00:04:54,722
is being considered
for an early release.

45
00:05:06,506 --> 00:05:09,236
I'm in big trouble now.

46
00:05:09,309 --> 00:05:13,871
The pterodactyl.
It was a lizard back in prehistoric times...

47
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:18,781
who developed an outside digit of the
forelimb which became greatly elongated...

48
00:05:18,851 --> 00:05:22,150
in order to support
a winged membrane.

49
00:05:22,255 --> 00:05:27,215
Now, he used this membrane to fly
high above his predators...

50
00:05:27,327 --> 00:05:31,593
which you gotta remember,
was way back in the Cretaceous period.

51
00:05:31,664 --> 00:05:34,895
And as far as periods go,
oh, it was a mother.

52
00:05:37,670 --> 00:05:40,696
<i>- Mr. Firpo.
- Uh, yes?</i>

53
00:05:40,773 --> 00:05:43,367
Where's all this going?

54
00:05:43,443 --> 00:05:46,207
Oh. Uh... well, uh...

55
00:05:46,279 --> 00:05:49,305
eh, skipping, skipping,
skipping, eh--

56
00:05:49,382 --> 00:05:54,752
What I, uh, I believe is that
once released from this prison...

57
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:58,847
<i>I, much like my reptilian brother,
shall take wing...</i>

58
00:05:58,958 --> 00:06:01,256
and fly high above
my problems...

59
00:06:04,831 --> 00:06:07,823
never to return!

60
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:11,996
That's it.

61
00:06:12,071 --> 00:06:15,507
That was very moving,
Mr. Firpo.

62
00:06:15,575 --> 00:06:20,672
But the prison psychiatry board says
you're incapable of telling the truth.

63
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:22,942
Well, that's a lie.

64
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:35,321
Alvin Firpo.
You have been labeled a kleptomaniac.

65
00:06:38,765 --> 00:06:41,029
<i>Alvin!</i>

66
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:43,864
Are you all right, Mr. Firpo?

67
00:06:43,936 --> 00:06:47,303
Okay. How you guys doin'?

68
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:49,603
My name's Alvin Firpo.

69
00:06:49,675 --> 00:06:54,669
And what I've learned in prison is that
robbin' and stealin' and all that horseshit--

70
00:06:54,747 --> 00:06:57,739
<i>There's somethin'that ain't right
about it. You know what I mean?</i>

71
00:06:57,817 --> 00:07:01,344
A lot of guys in here disagree with me,
but they're servin' time.

72
00:07:01,454 --> 00:07:05,823
I'm up for parole. Connect the dots.
Connect 'em.

73
00:07:05,892 --> 00:07:08,383
- So long, fellas.
- So long!

74
00:07:08,494 --> 00:07:11,156
- Yeah!

75
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:13,221
- Fresh air!
- Yes, sir.

76
00:07:13,299 --> 00:07:17,167
- So long, Jerry.
- Bye, boys.

77
00:07:17,236 --> 00:07:19,431
So long,Jerry. Take it easy.

78
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:22,099
- Smiley. Smiley, I'm gonna miss ya.
- Yeah, right.

79
00:07:22,175 --> 00:07:24,735
- Do me a favor. Get yourself something nice. All right.
- Thank you.

80
00:07:24,811 --> 00:07:27,075
- Enjoy it, Smiley.
- You stay out of trouble.

81
00:07:27,146 --> 00:07:31,378
- Hey, Bill! How are ya?
- All right. Let's start this off on the right foot.

82
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,817
Whatever it is,
the answer's no.

83
00:07:33,886 --> 00:07:36,946
''No''?
''No'' what? What are you talking about?

84
00:07:37,056 --> 00:07:39,991
Whatever it is that
you want me to do, the answer's no.

85
00:07:40,059 --> 00:07:42,493
- Does that apply to me too, Bill?
- No. I got no beef with you.

86
00:07:42,562 --> 00:07:44,496
- You sure?
- Yes.

87
00:07:44,564 --> 00:07:46,998
- 'Cause I wouldn't want you to be pissed at me.
- No. You're fine.

88
00:07:47,066 --> 00:07:49,694
- Really? There's no problem between us?
- There's startin' to be.

89
00:07:49,769 --> 00:07:54,832
- Well, it's nice to see you too.
- All right. Let's go see Ma.

90
00:07:54,907 --> 00:07:57,808
Hey, Alvin. I heard the economy
was in the shithouse.

91
00:07:57,877 --> 00:08:01,313
- I had no idea.
Look at that abandoned car.

92
00:08:01,380 --> 00:08:03,814
- It's my car. - What
the-- - Oh. Sorry.

93
00:08:03,883 --> 00:08:05,851
It's, uh-- It's nice.

94
00:08:05,918 --> 00:08:08,978
You gotta be kiddin'!

95
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,752
- Boy, I bet the space shuttle
makes less noise.

96
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:17,227
- Hey, Alvin. I never seen
stalactites in a car before.

97
00:08:17,296 --> 00:08:19,423
Stalactites!

98
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:22,525
I can see
nothing's changed.

99
00:08:22,602 --> 00:08:25,662
Yeah, nothin's changed,
huh, Dave?

100
00:08:29,809 --> 00:08:32,039
- Alvin, we're free.
- That's right. Free as a bird.

101
00:08:32,111 --> 00:08:34,602
Hey, Bill, you think this crate
could make it to Pennsylvania?

102
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:37,706
I got this friend in prison.
He's practically on his deathbed.

103
00:08:37,783 --> 00:08:42,220
He asked me to do him this favor. He
gave me a letter explaining everything.

104
00:08:42,321 --> 00:08:44,380
Here.
You gotta read this.

105
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:46,515
<i>It'll make you cry.</i>

106
00:08:50,162 --> 00:08:52,096
I detect resistance.

107
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,495
I knew you'd react like that. That's why
I got another copy for your future perusal.

108
00:08:59,572 --> 00:09:02,507
You two are on parole. You cannot leave
the state. You are in my custody.

109
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:07,069
You cannot go. So just quiet down,
my little one, and call me Dad.

110
00:09:07,146 --> 00:09:09,444
Hey, Dad.

111
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:12,313
Can we stop and get
some Ring Dings and milk?

112
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:14,649
<i>- Ring Dings and milk?
- Ring Dings and milk!</i>

113
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,883
Oh, yeah! Then we can get some balloons,
and we can go to the puppet show.

114
00:09:17,990 --> 00:09:21,858
<i>- What are you, two years old?
- Oh, well pardonez-moi.</i>

115
00:09:21,928 --> 00:09:25,455
We're not all fancy,
upscale restaurateurs like you, Bill.

116
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:28,932
Fine, fine. Then we'll get some Ring
Dings and milk for the child in the back.

117
00:09:29,001 --> 00:09:30,935
- Heh heh!
- Yummy, yummy.

118
00:09:44,417 --> 00:09:47,352
Shit!

119
00:09:49,722 --> 00:09:52,953
<i>Idiot!</i>

120
00:09:56,395 --> 00:09:59,455
Come here!

121
00:09:59,532 --> 00:10:01,796
- Hey!
- What's the problem?

122
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:04,028
Come on, l--
What are you--

123
00:10:04,103 --> 00:10:08,802
- No, no! It's all right!
Put the money back!

124
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:25,818
All right, all right,
all right, all right!

125
00:10:25,925 --> 00:10:29,053
<i>Policia! Policia!</i>

126
00:10:32,465 --> 00:10:35,366
Get your hand
out of your pocket!

127
00:10:37,503 --> 00:10:40,836
Son of a bitch! I'm not with you five
minutes, and I'm being chased by cops!

128
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:54,077
Come here!
Up against the wall!

129
00:10:54,153 --> 00:10:56,644
Come here!
Come on! Come on!

130
00:10:56,756 --> 00:10:59,589
Get up against the wall!
Get up against the wall!

131
00:11:01,060 --> 00:11:03,858
<i>- Come on!
- Freeze, goddamn it! I'll shoot!</i>

132
00:11:03,929 --> 00:11:07,092
Sergeant Dickman, off duty, Queens!
What is your name, rookie?

133
00:11:07,166 --> 00:11:11,193
- Birdie.
- I got the mayor up my ass on account of punks like you!

134
00:11:11,270 --> 00:11:15,366
- So stop jackin' off, get the car and pick up this scum!
- Okay.

135
00:11:15,441 --> 00:11:17,500
- Move!
- Yes, sir!

136
00:11:26,686 --> 00:11:30,053
<i>You know, Bill, there are
8,000,000 stories in the naked city.</i>

137
00:11:30,156 --> 00:11:33,614
- Not all of them revolve around you.
- Come on. Don't hold back, Ma.

138
00:11:33,726 --> 00:11:37,025
That's cream corn. Look at that stuff.
One more. Come on. That's delicious.

139
00:11:37,096 --> 00:11:42,432
Can't beat it with a stick. Thank you.
Yeah, warm me up. It's great to be home, Ma.

140
00:11:42,501 --> 00:11:45,163
- I miss this little piece of heaven.
- Yeah. I missed you, Ma.

141
00:11:45,237 --> 00:11:48,673
I missed you boys too.

142
00:11:48,741 --> 00:11:51,733
You know what else
I miss around here?

143
00:11:51,811 --> 00:11:56,145
<i>I miss all the creature comforts we used
to have when you boys were around--</i>

144
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,048
VCRs, big-screen TVs.

145
00:11:59,118 --> 00:12:01,052
- You remember?
- Yeah.

146
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:04,954
Boy, you could hardly move in here.

147
00:12:05,057 --> 00:12:08,288
Hardly move! Big-screen TV!

148
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:12,160
Yeah, I wonder who misses them more--
you or the original owners.

149
00:12:12,231 --> 00:12:15,530
Aw, baloney. Are you sayin'
that stuff was stolen?

150
00:12:15,601 --> 00:12:18,263
No, Ma. Dave and Alvin
would never steal anything.

151
00:12:18,337 --> 00:12:21,101
They're saints.
That car wash robbed itself.

152
00:12:21,173 --> 00:12:23,539
We were at the park
all day.

153
00:12:23,609 --> 00:12:28,546
They didn't have a shred of evidence,
'cept for our fingerprints.

154
00:12:28,614 --> 00:12:31,242
What's this?

155
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:35,083
Oh. You don't wanna read that, Ma.
That's a real heartbreaker.

156
00:12:35,154 --> 00:12:38,453
<i>- Yeah, Ma. That's wicked bad.
- Mm.</i>

157
00:12:38,557 --> 00:12:44,325
''Dear Dave and Alvin. It's been five
years since I've seen my daughter.

158
00:12:44,396 --> 00:12:48,492
As I told you before,
she refuses to visit me here.

159
00:12:48,567 --> 00:12:51,968
<i>I'm gettin'old,
and I can't stand the thought...</i>

160
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:54,130
of another Christmas...

161
00:12:56,375 --> 00:12:58,673
going by without seeing her.

162
00:12:59,912 --> 00:13:02,244
Her name is Sarah...

163
00:13:02,314 --> 00:13:06,273
and she's the only thing in the world
that means anything...

164
00:13:06,352 --> 00:13:08,343
to me.

165
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:10,980
<i>I know I'm askin'a lot...</i>

166
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:15,424
but I would like for you to look her
up in that town I mentioned to you...

167
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:17,962
Paradise, Pennsylvania...

168
00:13:18,063 --> 00:13:21,658
<i>and beg her
to come see me.</i>

169
00:13:26,505 --> 00:13:30,965
I know bein' on parole, you're not
supposed to leave the state.

170
00:13:31,043 --> 00:13:36,046
But you two bastards owe me
for all the shit I've done for you...

171
00:13:36,081 --> 00:13:40,142
<i>and if you don't do it, I promise I will
somehow escape from this place...</i>

172
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:43,711
track you down like dogs...

173
00:13:43,789 --> 00:13:48,658
rip off your heads
and shit down your throats.

174
00:13:48,761 --> 00:13:51,662
All my love
this holiday season...

175
00:13:51,730 --> 00:13:54,699
Vic Mazzucci.''

176
00:13:54,767 --> 00:13:57,235
Bravo. Oh, come on!

177
00:13:57,303 --> 00:13:59,931
I gotta get out
of this loony bin.

178
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:02,540
How can you ignore a man like this?

179
00:14:02,608 --> 00:14:06,339
Ma, I'm sure he's the nicest killer on ''C''
block, but I really got to get to work.

180
00:14:06,412 --> 00:14:09,904
Look, has anybody seen my wallet?

181
00:14:09,982 --> 00:14:12,746
If your head wasn't
screwed on--

182
00:14:12,818 --> 00:14:14,877
Fine. I'm leaving.

183
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:20,153
- Good evening. May I assist you with your specials tonight?
- Yes, waiter.

184
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:22,854
Actually, I'm the,
uh, the manager.

185
00:14:22,962 --> 00:14:25,294
- What exactly is in the bouillabaisse?
- I'll call you back.

186
00:14:25,364 --> 00:14:27,389
Well, it's a variety
of things, actually.

187
00:14:27,499 --> 00:14:31,196
It's a splendid array of fish,
shellfish, garlic, paprika--

188
00:14:31,270 --> 00:14:33,795
Hey! Is my brother
doin' a great job?

189
00:14:33,873 --> 00:14:36,068
Oh, we're
very proud of him.

190
00:14:36,141 --> 00:14:40,043
Would you please, uh-- Would you
please excuse me for a moment?

191
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:43,047
- What are you doing here?
- I'm here to save your life!

192
00:14:43,115 --> 00:14:45,675
- You gotta get out of here. This
is where I work. - Yeah, but--

193
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:48,845
This is where I work. Do not come
down here and screw things up, okay?

194
00:14:48,921 --> 00:14:51,185
Whatever it is,
we'll talk about it at home.

195
00:14:51,257 --> 00:14:53,521
<i>You don't understand. You can't go home.</i>

196
00:14:53,592 --> 00:14:56,288
Holy shit!
They're here already.

197
00:14:56,395 --> 00:14:59,523
Hm. Well, we gotta give these cops
one thing, they're efficient.

198
00:14:59,632 --> 00:15:02,567
- What are you talking about?
- Your wallet!

199
00:15:02,635 --> 00:15:06,036
- You dropped your wallet at the
scene of the crime in the Bronx.

200
00:15:06,105 --> 00:15:08,801
- The cops were at the house. They're
askin' Ma questions. - Cops-- Did Ma--

201
00:15:08,874 --> 00:15:11,104
- That's right! I'm here
to rescue you. Calm down.

202
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,610
- Me and Alvin borrowed a car. Let's go.
- Okay.

203
00:15:13,679 --> 00:15:17,740
<i>Hey! Come on! Let's go!</i>

204
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:20,512
- Come on! Run!
- Hurry up!

205
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:22,884
Let's get outta here!

206
00:15:22,955 --> 00:15:27,153
I can't tell you how sorry I am.

207
00:15:38,270 --> 00:15:41,797
What's going on at the house?
Yeah.

208
00:15:42,808 --> 00:15:44,833
What? You're kiddin'!

209
00:15:44,910 --> 00:15:49,347
<i>Oh, no. You think we should
stay out of New York altogether?</i>

210
00:15:49,415 --> 00:15:51,975
Ma, it's Christmas Eve,
and we're--

211
00:15:52,051 --> 00:15:56,283
Yeah, well, we're in New Jersey now.
That's not far enough away?

212
00:15:56,355 --> 00:16:01,122
<i>Yeah, but, Ma, we want to come home.
It's Chri-- Yeah, but we--</i>

213
00:16:03,963 --> 00:16:06,989
All right. All right.
Yeah, I'll tell him.

214
00:16:07,099 --> 00:16:09,966
Yeah. I love you too.
All right.

215
00:16:11,236 --> 00:16:14,034
Here, Bill.
I got you this.

216
00:16:14,106 --> 00:16:16,973
Something to read.

217
00:16:17,042 --> 00:16:19,442
Take your mind
off of things.

218
00:16:20,546 --> 00:16:23,743
Can I play--
Hm?

219
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:26,808
<i>Listen, I got more bad news.
Ma says the cops are at the house.</i>

220
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:28,944
<i>They'rejust
drivin'her nuts.</i>

221
00:16:29,021 --> 00:16:33,685
Maybe we can go to Pennsylvania, and Alvin
and I could do that favor for our friend...

222
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,751
<i>- and his daughter.
- What I'd like to do...</i>

223
00:16:36,829 --> 00:16:41,095
is go back home.

224
00:16:41,166 --> 00:16:44,363
<i>You know, Bill, maybe if we did
something for somebody else...</i>

225
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:47,405
it'd have a way of
coming back around for us.

226
00:16:49,008 --> 00:16:51,374
- You set me up.
- What?

227
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:56,938
Is this, uh-- Is this one of your
elaborate schemes?

228
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:59,576
<i>- Oh, come on. Now, would I do that to you?
- Dave...</i>

229
00:17:01,587 --> 00:17:04,351
I know how
your mind works.

230
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:07,950
You know exactly
what you're doin'...

231
00:17:08,060 --> 00:17:12,588
and the whole time...
you stand there...

232
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:14,859
<i>with this ''Who, me?''...</i>

233
00:17:14,967 --> 00:17:19,734
expression...
on your face!

234
00:17:21,373 --> 00:17:23,364
You're doing it right now.

235
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:29,804
All right. Get in the car.
Just get in the car.

236
00:17:29,882 --> 00:17:32,544
Alvin, is it me?

237
00:17:32,618 --> 00:17:34,609
Move!

238
00:17:59,545 --> 00:18:03,481
Look, guys...
I'm a sport. I'm here.

239
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:07,178
You know, and so...
do me a favor.

240
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:11,313
- Let's try to keep this as inconspicuous as possible.
- Oh, absolutely.

241
00:18:26,305 --> 00:18:28,296
Timmy!

242
00:18:30,075 --> 00:18:32,339
Merlin, are you okay?

243
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:36,871
- Easy, Merlin. Easy. Easy.
- Very nice, very nice. Another cop.

244
00:18:36,949 --> 00:18:40,180
<i>All right. Let me through there.
Timmy, what happened?</i>

245
00:18:40,252 --> 00:18:42,743
- I fell, Dad.
- Are you hurt?

246
00:18:42,821 --> 00:18:45,483
I'm all right, Dad.
How about Merlin?

247
00:18:45,557 --> 00:18:47,548
Merlin's fine.
Merlin's fine.

248
00:18:47,659 --> 00:18:50,958
Hey, I'm real sorry, you know. It's just
that, uh, he rode right out in front of us.

249
00:18:51,063 --> 00:18:53,054
<i>I didn't know what to do.</i>

250
00:18:53,165 --> 00:18:55,133
- Is he retarded?
- Yeah.

251
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:57,702
Come here a second.

252
00:18:59,471 --> 00:19:04,704
Look. My boy's a little slow.
You understand?

253
00:19:04,776 --> 00:19:06,971
<i>- I'm sure it wasn't your fault.
- Anybody hurt?</i>

254
00:19:07,045 --> 00:19:09,309
- No. Everybody's fine, Father Gorenzel.
- Oh, good.

255
00:19:09,381 --> 00:19:12,441
<i>- That'd be no way to start Christmas Eve.
- Heh! Right.</i>

256
00:19:12,518 --> 00:19:17,785
<i>All right. Back up, everybody. Just go on with
your business. There's nothing here to watch.</i>

257
00:19:17,856 --> 00:19:21,815
Thanks. Thanks very much. Thank you.
I'm sorry for the inconvenience, boys.

258
00:19:21,927 --> 00:19:26,387
<i>- Is there anything I can do to help you?
- Uh, no. I don't think so.</i>

259
00:19:26,498 --> 00:19:28,989
What are you here for,
the Winterfest?

260
00:19:29,101 --> 00:19:32,434
Yeah, that and we're
looking for a Sarah Mazzucci.

261
00:19:32,504 --> 00:19:36,838
Mazzucci? I don't think there's anybody
by the name of Sarah Mazzucci in this town.

262
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:40,606
As a matter of fact, the only Sarah
I know is a Sarah Collins.

263
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,671
- She works right there.
- Where?

264
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,582
- Right there. Heh!
- Oh.

265
00:19:46,652 --> 00:19:49,485
<i>The town bank.</i>

266
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:52,490
- Imagine that.
- Yeah. Imagine that.

267
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:57,586
Well, if you get your car out of the way, we'll
get the traffic movin'. See ya later. Thank you.

268
00:19:57,696 --> 00:20:01,325
- Well, let's go check it out.
- He just said her name was Collins.

269
00:20:01,433 --> 00:20:05,164
Maybe she got married.

270
00:20:28,794 --> 00:20:31,285
Where could she be?
Where could she be?

271
00:21:16,275 --> 00:21:19,472
Wait a minute.
Hold up. Excuse me.

272
00:21:19,544 --> 00:21:21,978
Those are for
the children.

273
00:21:22,047 --> 00:21:26,177
- And the sign says ''Take a pen,'' not ''Take all the pens.''
- Oh.

274
00:21:26,251 --> 00:21:28,776
- Can I have 'em back?
- The pen-- It said, ''Take''--

275
00:21:28,854 --> 00:21:30,845
- Come on.
- Oh.

276
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:34,323
- It said on the sign--
- All of them. All of them.

277
00:21:34,393 --> 00:21:38,352
- Give 'em up.
- It said-- It said--

278
00:21:40,198 --> 00:21:42,666
Are you all right?

279
00:21:44,469 --> 00:21:48,132
Okay. Okay.

280
00:21:48,206 --> 00:21:51,539
Sarah, honey.
All the pens are gone.

281
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:55,671
<i>- Yeah, I know. I have them
right here, Mr. Anderson.</i>

282
00:21:55,747 --> 00:21:58,716
- New customer?
- Heh heh!

283
00:22:00,352 --> 00:22:03,014
Sarah?

284
00:22:03,088 --> 00:22:05,886
- Sarah Collins?
- Yeah?

285
00:22:05,957 --> 00:22:08,949
- Are you married?
- Why? Are you gonna propose?

286
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:11,222
Yes.

287
00:22:11,330 --> 00:22:13,992
Do I know you?

288
00:22:16,468 --> 00:22:21,735
No. I'm Bill. I apologize for my brother.
He's, uh--

289
00:22:22,808 --> 00:22:26,869
Ohh... mentally retarded.

290
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:31,848
You know, he's a diabetic, and we were
afraid he was gonna go into insulin shock.

291
00:22:31,917 --> 00:22:34,750
I said, ''Hey, why don't you
go and find yourself...

292
00:22:34,820 --> 00:22:37,414
something sweet?''

293
00:22:39,424 --> 00:22:41,858
- It was nice meeting you.
- Yes. It was nice meeting you...

294
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:44,929
- Nice meeting you. Very nice, Sarah.
- Sarah.

295
00:22:49,234 --> 00:22:51,202
Wrong Sarah?

296
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:54,795
Well, I guess that just depends
on how you look at it, doesn't it?

297
00:22:54,873 --> 00:22:56,864
Yeah.

298
00:22:56,942 --> 00:23:01,470
Hey, Bill, don't you just love this
old, classic architecture?

299
00:23:01,546 --> 00:23:03,844
Forget it.

300
00:23:03,915 --> 00:23:08,784
- Forget what?
- I got eyes. I know you. Forget it.

301
00:23:08,854 --> 00:23:12,790
One, I ain't doin' it,
no matter how good it looks.

302
00:23:12,858 --> 00:23:16,055
And two, there's no money
in the vault.

303
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:29,801
- And what have we here?
- $275,000.

304
00:23:29,875 --> 00:23:34,039
<i>- Would you mind signing here,
Mr. Anderson?</i>

305
00:23:34,112 --> 00:23:36,103
You all right?

306
00:23:36,181 --> 00:23:38,308
<i>See you, boys.</i>

307
00:23:38,383 --> 00:23:40,374
Alvin, come on.

308
00:23:40,452 --> 00:23:42,716
- Merry Christmas.
- Good night, sir.

309
00:23:42,788 --> 00:23:45,086
Where the hell are we going
in such a hurry?

310
00:23:45,157 --> 00:23:47,523
It doesn't matter.
Just get us out of here.

311
00:23:47,592 --> 00:23:49,924
- What's the matter?
- What's the matter?

312
00:23:50,028 --> 00:23:52,462
Yeah.

313
00:23:52,531 --> 00:23:55,694
I'm telling you, if I had a gun
on me right now...

314
00:23:55,767 --> 00:23:58,861
I'd go in that bank
and take that place over.

315
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:02,663
Say, Bill.

316
00:24:02,741 --> 00:24:07,440
Would you be terribly upset with me
if I were to tell you...

317
00:24:07,512 --> 00:24:11,243
that there may
possibly be guns...

318
00:24:11,316 --> 00:24:14,615
- in the trunk?
- Alvin, pull the car over.

319
00:24:14,686 --> 00:24:17,246
- What?
- Pull it over!

320
00:24:17,322 --> 00:24:19,654
All right, all right, all right! Easy!

321
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,631
All right.
Get out of the car.

322
00:24:32,237 --> 00:24:34,296
Come on.

323
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:38,468
- Get out.
- All right, all right.

324
00:24:40,145 --> 00:24:43,876
What is your problem?

325
00:24:43,949 --> 00:24:46,645
<i>There's guns in the trunk,
and I got a problem?</i>

326
00:24:46,718 --> 00:24:49,346
- Hey, I borrowed the car from Fast Eddie.
- Who the hell is Fast Eddie?

327
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:53,983
- He owns the gun shop on Morris Park Avenue.
- Oh, terrific.

328
00:24:54,059 --> 00:24:56,687
So chances are,
there's an arsenal back there.

329
00:24:56,795 --> 00:25:00,287
- There's probably a couple of
shotguns and.45s. - Oh. Uh-huh.

330
00:25:00,398 --> 00:25:03,993
But you haven't actually
seen these guns, have you, Dave.

331
00:25:04,069 --> 00:25:07,732
- No. No,just an assumption.
- No, we haven't seen--

332
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,842
<i>Oh, my God! Guns!</i>

333
00:25:14,112 --> 00:25:16,279
Big surprise, huh?

334
00:25:20,252 --> 00:25:22,948
<i>- Which way do you think the mouse is headed?</i>

335
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:07,955
Hmm.

336
00:26:33,558 --> 00:26:37,494
You idiot! We're about to rob a bank, and
you're gonna get us pinched for stealin' hats?

337
00:26:37,562 --> 00:26:39,587
Oh, hey, I'm sorry.

338
00:26:39,664 --> 00:26:44,328
- What?
- I was-- I was--

339
00:26:46,037 --> 00:26:50,064
- I was-- - You gotta be
kidding me? What are you doing?

340
00:26:50,141 --> 00:26:54,009
<i>Hmm. What?</i>

341
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,137
I can't even--

342
00:27:08,259 --> 00:27:11,524
Oh, and, uh,
however much these cost.

343
00:27:19,204 --> 00:27:22,731
Would you quit hoverin'
'round me like bad news?

344
00:27:22,807 --> 00:27:27,176
- What do you want me to do?
- Bag this stuff.

345
00:27:27,278 --> 00:27:29,576
- All of it?
- No.

346
00:27:29,681 --> 00:27:33,082
Just what you haven't become
emotionally attached to.

347
00:27:33,151 --> 00:27:36,848
Oh, Christ on a crooked crutch!
Get out of the way!

348
00:27:38,523 --> 00:27:41,390
You boys here
for the Winterfest?

349
00:27:41,459 --> 00:27:45,054
No, we're just--
we're just passin' through.

350
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:46,961
- Just passin' through?

351
00:27:47,032 --> 00:27:51,128
- Just passin' through!
- Passin'.

352
00:28:11,823 --> 00:28:15,190
- Whoa! Don't shut it off.
- What?

353
00:28:15,260 --> 00:28:17,524
We won't have time
to hot-wire it again.

354
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:21,087
Bill, you do what you do,
and I do what I do.

355
00:28:21,166 --> 00:28:25,159
That enhances
my sense of security.

356
00:28:29,708 --> 00:28:31,972
All right.

357
00:28:32,043 --> 00:28:34,568
All right. Let's do it!

358
00:28:44,055 --> 00:28:47,889
<i>All right! This is a goddamn robbery!</i>

359
00:28:47,959 --> 00:28:50,689
<i>- Do not move!
- Get your hands up now!</i>

360
00:28:50,762 --> 00:28:54,391
- Do not move!
- Get 'em up! Get away from that phone! Get 'em up!

361
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:58,630
<i>Who is talking? Who is talking?</i>

362
00:28:58,703 --> 00:29:03,367
<i>Do you boys really,
um-- Do you boys really want to do this?</i>

363
00:29:03,441 --> 00:29:05,966
<i>- Do what?
- Wha-- Um--</i>

364
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:10,647
Heh! You know...
rob the bank.

365
00:29:10,715 --> 00:29:14,913
Absolutely! We have thought this over,
and this is the thing to do!

366
00:29:14,986 --> 00:29:20,049
- Keep 'em up!
- But-But on-on Christmas Eve? l-- Eh-Eh--

367
00:29:20,125 --> 00:29:24,824
It doesn't seem right, don't you think?
You're going to ruin the Winterfest.

368
00:29:27,866 --> 00:29:29,891
The Winterfest?

369
00:29:29,968 --> 00:29:34,234
I have a gun... and you're talkin'
about the Winterfest?

370
00:29:34,305 --> 00:29:36,296
<i>Well, who are you?</i>

371
00:29:36,374 --> 00:29:40,936
<i>- I'm married to Mr. Anderson...
- Ooh, lucky him.</i>

372
00:29:41,045 --> 00:29:44,071
the president
of the bank.

373
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:49,245
l-- Eh-- The bank vault is closed
right now. It's locked.

374
00:29:49,320 --> 00:29:53,120
l- It's locked? All right!
Who's got the key? Raise your hand!

375
00:29:53,191 --> 00:29:56,820
Rai-- Oh.

376
00:29:56,895 --> 00:30:01,696
All right. Lower your hands.
Who's got a key? Raise your hand.

377
00:30:01,766 --> 00:30:04,701
You got-- No? All right.
Raise your hands.

378
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:09,468
- Key! Key!
- All right, you fashion queen. Who's got the key?

379
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:13,136
- My husband is the only one
with the key. - Ke-e-ey! Key!

380
00:30:13,244 --> 00:30:18,477
My husband is the only one with a key,
and I'm afraid he's out to lunch right now.

381
00:30:18,550 --> 00:30:20,609
Well, when's he get back?

382
00:30:20,718 --> 00:30:24,984
Oh, about, um...
45 minutes.

383
00:30:25,056 --> 00:30:29,823
Okay! Nobody move! Keep your hands up!
Stay away from the phones!

384
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:34,223
Forty-five minutes
ain't bad.

385
00:30:34,299 --> 00:30:38,326
- You need a lobotomy.
- Don't get nasty with me.

386
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:41,463
- It was just a suggestion.
- Uh-- Eh--

387
00:30:41,539 --> 00:30:44,667
- I'm gonna get ya. I'm comin' at ya.
- Oh, oh, oh.

388
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:48,200
Mrs. Anderson.

389
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:54,575
- And gotcha!
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

390
00:30:54,686 --> 00:30:56,654
I'm coming, I'm coming.

391
00:30:58,122 --> 00:31:01,455
- Keep 'em up!
- Where are you going?

392
00:31:01,526 --> 00:31:04,689
- I'm going with you to get the key.
- No! You stay here!

393
00:31:04,762 --> 00:31:07,060
Don't you two
fall in love.

394
00:31:09,033 --> 00:31:11,194
You heard him!
I'm staying here!

395
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:18,075
You do what you do,
and I do what I do.

396
00:31:18,142 --> 00:31:21,168
Over there in the--
in the coffee shop.

397
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,248
- Ooh!

398
00:31:25,283 --> 00:31:28,047
Huh? What? What?

399
00:31:28,119 --> 00:31:32,522
Hey. Hey, what's goin' on?
We done yet? 'Cause I'm starvin'.

400
00:31:32,590 --> 00:31:36,048
Vault's locked. Gotta get a key. Bank
president's in there having lunch. Let's go.

401
00:31:36,127 --> 00:31:38,118
Oh, lunch. Good.

402
00:31:38,196 --> 00:31:43,930
Everybody, nothin's gonna happen.
Keep your hands up and relax.

403
00:31:44,002 --> 00:31:46,232
<i>What are you lookin'at?</i>

404
00:31:46,304 --> 00:31:49,603
Look, let's sing a song.
All right? It's Christmas.

405
00:31:54,746 --> 00:31:57,772
- Where is he?
- That's him in the back.

406
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:05,583
<i>- Come on!
- Oh,you can't get to heaven</i>

407
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:16,224
That's right. Feel better?

408
00:32:20,338 --> 00:32:22,670
Sorry. I'm sorry.

409
00:32:22,740 --> 00:32:26,267
Mr. Anderson?

410
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:29,778
<i>- I'll bring him over to the house if it's all right.
- That would be nice.</i>

411
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:32,145
<i>Has he got a friend
he wants to bring?</i>

412
00:32:35,019 --> 00:32:38,318
Nobody move, goddamn it!
This is a robbery!

413
00:32:38,389 --> 00:32:41,654
It's a robbery! It's a robbery!
It's a robbery!

414
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,626
<i>Shh!</i>

415
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:46,323
Where are you going?

416
00:32:48,566 --> 00:32:51,433
l-- It's a robbery.

417
00:32:51,502 --> 00:32:54,266
I'm going to get you money
out of the cash register.

418
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:56,466
I'm robbing the bank!

419
00:32:58,776 --> 00:33:01,973
Well, the bank...
is across the street.

420
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,378
I know the bank
is across the street.

421
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:07,850
I need to get Mr. Anderson
over there to open up the vault!

422
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:10,615
Could you hold this
for a second?

423
00:33:10,688 --> 00:33:15,853
Could ya? Thank you so much. All right.
That looks tasty. A little salt never hurt.

424
00:33:15,927 --> 00:33:18,327
- Yum, yum.
- What are you doing?

425
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:21,331
- I'm eatin' scrapple.
- Don't touch any of that! We're gettin' out of here!

426
00:33:21,399 --> 00:33:24,527
- It's got scallions.
- Get your hands up!

427
00:33:26,671 --> 00:33:29,196
Well, well.

428
00:33:29,273 --> 00:33:34,540
Somebody got their Christmas bonus early.
What do you think he did? Drink it?

429
00:33:34,645 --> 00:33:36,840
Hey, you're not gonna leave
all these people here, are ya?

430
00:33:36,948 --> 00:33:40,213
I mean, any one of them will call
the cops the second we're outta here.

431
00:33:51,429 --> 00:33:55,627
And breathe... and let it out.

432
00:33:55,700 --> 00:33:59,192
Good, good. It's just your basic yoga.
I learned it in prison.

433
00:33:59,270 --> 00:34:02,603
It's good for tense situations like this--
robbery-- or if you ever do go to prison.

434
00:34:02,673 --> 00:34:05,972
You're surrounded by 10 men.
Helps to relax you.

435
00:34:08,713 --> 00:34:11,648
We're just gonna take the money,
believe me. No one's gonna get hurt.

436
00:34:11,749 --> 00:34:16,550
- We only want your cash.
- Move forward. Move forward. Go in. Move forward.

437
00:34:16,621 --> 00:34:18,714
Everybody come in.
Keep your hands up.

438
00:34:18,790 --> 00:34:22,954
Anybody who moves will get shot,
as will the person next to you.

439
00:34:23,027 --> 00:34:24,961
The two-for-one thing.

440
00:34:25,029 --> 00:34:28,226
<i>- I just got through relaxin' 'em. You're makin' 'em all panic.
- You stay here!</i>

441
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:31,359
<i>- All right. Get in. Just keep your hands up.
- Open the door.</i>

442
00:34:31,436 --> 00:34:35,065
So it's ground beef-cheese-scallion
scrapple.

443
00:34:35,139 --> 00:34:37,733
Heh heh! Thanks a lot.

444
00:34:37,809 --> 00:34:41,301
All right. Come on. Let's go.
Keep your hands up. Move.

445
00:34:41,412 --> 00:34:43,539
You bring the whole town?

446
00:34:44,882 --> 00:34:46,907
<i>Move forward.</i>

447
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:50,880
<i>- Go forward. There's plenty of space.
- It's okay.</i>

448
00:34:50,955 --> 00:34:52,946
- Move!
- I'm mov--

449
00:34:53,024 --> 00:34:55,822
<i>- Who here, this is their
first robbery? Raise your hand.</i>

450
00:34:55,893 --> 00:34:59,260
<i>- Back off!.Come on.
- Yeah, you? First one?</i>

451
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:02,060
Come on! Back off.
Okay. Back away. Back away!

452
00:35:02,133 --> 00:35:05,364
All right, now. This is just a robbery.
No one will get hurt.

453
00:35:05,436 --> 00:35:10,339
For those of you just joining us, keep your
hands up. We were doing a little yoga earlier.

454
00:35:10,408 --> 00:35:13,900
<i>I see there's some people
still shaking. Let's breathe in.</i>

455
00:35:14,011 --> 00:35:16,104
- We're all right.
Just stay out of their way.

456
00:35:16,214 --> 00:35:18,205
<i>And out.</i>

457
00:35:19,584 --> 00:35:23,213
<i>Anybody have to go to the bathroom?
Raise your hand.</i>

458
00:35:23,287 --> 00:35:28,224
<i>Huh! Tough! We'll be
done here very shortly.</i>

459
00:35:28,292 --> 00:35:32,991
<i>This is something you will be able to
take home with you after this robbery--</i>

460
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:37,262
<i>A little exercise, which it looks like
some of you could use. All right?</i>

461
00:35:37,335 --> 00:35:39,633
So, let's breathe in.

462
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:41,831
Breath in. Good. Hold it.
And let it out.

463
00:35:41,906 --> 00:35:45,307
Good. And one more deep breath in.

464
00:35:45,376 --> 00:35:49,107
<i>Everybody. And let it out. Good.</i>

465
00:35:49,213 --> 00:35:51,010
<i>What the hell did you do?</i>

466
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:54,415
Shit!
All right, back away!

467
00:35:54,485 --> 00:35:56,851
<i>Everyone,
keep your hands up!</i>

468
00:36:04,595 --> 00:36:09,123
<i>- I'm Alvin Firpo, Officer.
I was just here...</i>

469
00:36:09,200 --> 00:36:11,794
waiting to see when the meter ran out.

470
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:19,568
Where's he goin'?

471
00:36:26,317 --> 00:36:29,343
Aw, g'wan,
ya sons of bitches!

472
00:36:29,453 --> 00:36:32,149
- You want a piece of this? Come on!
- Oof!.

473
00:36:32,223 --> 00:36:35,215
- Come on. Come on.
- Kiss my ass.

474
00:36:35,293 --> 00:36:37,727
Damn!

475
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:39,990
I'm gonna kill
that son of a bitch!

476
00:36:41,332 --> 00:36:45,268
- Holy skunk! Yeah,
you! - What? - Go!

477
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:52,470
- Hey!
- Alvin!

478
00:36:54,245 --> 00:36:56,543
Is he gonna do it again?
Is he gonna do it again?

479
00:37:01,285 --> 00:37:04,686
- Well, didn't go out of your way, did ya?
- You're here, ain't ya?

480
00:37:56,874 --> 00:37:59,172
<i>What's that?</i>

481
00:37:59,243 --> 00:38:02,838
Oh, shit. I still got the keys
to the vault on me.

482
00:38:06,450 --> 00:38:08,418
Same time next year.

483
00:38:13,457 --> 00:38:16,221
Hey, Mazzucci.
Tell us about that bank you broke into.

484
00:38:16,294 --> 00:38:19,991
- I'm tired of tellin' that story.
- Aw, Victor, come on.

485
00:38:20,064 --> 00:38:22,498
- All right, all right.
- Tell it nice and slow.

486
00:38:22,566 --> 00:38:27,367
Okay. This bank is like
a beautiful orchard.

487
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:29,929
Only instead of fruit,
there's money ripening on the vine.

488
00:38:30,007 --> 00:38:34,034
- It's just waiting to be picked.
- I love the way he tells this story.

489
00:38:34,145 --> 00:38:37,637
No camera, and the security guard,
he's older than water.

490
00:38:37,748 --> 00:38:41,115
- Oh, this can't be true!
- Vic, what are we doin' in this joint?

491
00:38:41,185 --> 00:38:44,882
<i>Ooh! Ain't you worried
about talkin'here?</i>

492
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:47,924
- What if somebody beat ya to the punch?
- Are you crazy?

493
00:38:47,992 --> 00:38:52,088
Who's gonna double-cross him? He's
buried more people than Forest Lawn!

494
00:38:56,267 --> 00:38:59,361
Vic, you know that bank job
you guys are always talking about?

495
00:38:59,437 --> 00:39:02,304
- Yeah. What about it?
- Was it in Pennsylvania?

496
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:06,002
- Yeah. Yeah. Why?
- Paradise? It just got robbed. Came over the TV.

497
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:09,205
<i>Hey, Vic. Isn't that where
your daughter Sarah works?</i>

498
00:39:09,313 --> 00:39:13,044
<i>Do you think those Firpo brothers had
anything to do with it? Those rat bastards.</i>

499
00:39:14,085 --> 00:39:16,144
<i>Vic?</i>

500
00:39:16,253 --> 00:39:20,485
<i>Aagh!</i>

501
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:32,459
Welcome to Paradise,
gentlemen.

502
00:39:32,570 --> 00:39:35,266
Agent Peyser, sir.

503
00:39:35,339 --> 00:39:38,035
- Right this way.
- I want agents at every roadblock.

504
00:39:38,109 --> 00:39:40,202
- I don't trust these local cops.
- Okay.

505
00:39:40,277 --> 00:39:42,711
I don't care what their story is.
Everybody everywhere is a suspect.

506
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,873
- You got it.
- Got it.

507
00:39:44,949 --> 00:39:48,214
- Hi. I'm Chief Burnell.
- Special Agent Peyser.

508
00:39:48,285 --> 00:39:51,743
- Yeah. This is my son. He's Deputy Timmy Burnell.
- Okay. Okay.

509
00:39:51,822 --> 00:39:54,552
- Hi!
- Hi.

510
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:58,425
Move back, please.

511
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,987
Move it! Move it.

512
00:40:01,065 --> 00:40:03,499
- Whoo!
- The first thing I want to know--

513
00:40:03,567 --> 00:40:06,001
Do think this bank
was hit by locals or outsiders?

514
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:09,198
I can't really say, but we've never had
a problem like this before.

515
00:40:09,273 --> 00:40:11,833
I can't really believe
it would be anybody from town.

516
00:40:11,909 --> 00:40:14,673
- Anybody suspicious around before
the bank was robbed? - Oh, well--

517
00:40:14,745 --> 00:40:17,407
- Jesus Christ, Bernie. What the hell's goin' on?
- Hi, Ed. How ya doin'?

518
00:40:17,481 --> 00:40:21,508
I tell ya, this town is crawlin' with
tourists. That's 'cause of our Winterfest.

519
00:40:21,585 --> 00:40:25,715
Your guess is probably as good as mine. But
there was three guys in town this morning.

520
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:28,088
Yeah.
Nearly run over my kid.

521
00:40:28,159 --> 00:40:32,493
- I've never seen 'em before.
- This way. Watch your step.

522
00:40:32,563 --> 00:40:34,554
It's right through here.

523
00:40:34,665 --> 00:40:36,895
What kind of car was it?

524
00:40:37,001 --> 00:40:39,265
- Ah, an Infinity.
- Merry Christmas, Gentlemen.

525
00:40:39,336 --> 00:40:42,430
- Merry Christmas.
- The snow came down pretty fast.

526
00:40:42,506 --> 00:40:45,373
Hopefully they're still in the area.
Put out an A.P.B. on that car.

527
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:50,471
- I've already done that.
- Good. Well, with any luck, we ought to be able to find 'em...

528
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:53,278
especially if
they're heading north.

529
00:40:53,350 --> 00:40:55,409
Alvin.

530
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:59,952
What?

531
00:41:00,057 --> 00:41:02,082
Where are we headed?

532
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:05,953
North.

533
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:12,597
<i>- How do you know?
- I swear we passed that farmhouse before.</i>

534
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:16,231
Right. Oh, no. All those farm houses,
they look alike.

535
00:41:16,307 --> 00:41:19,470
Alvin, if we're going around in circles,
I'm gonna break your neck.

536
00:41:19,543 --> 00:41:22,103
I just did
what the map said. I made four lefts.

537
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:25,637
Four lefts is a circle, you idiot!

538
00:41:25,716 --> 00:41:28,913
Are you sure?

539
00:41:28,986 --> 00:41:33,548
- Oh, state trooper. Oh, shit! Shit!
- All right! Relax, relax.

540
00:41:33,624 --> 00:41:36,991
<i>- Don't make eye contact.
- He's turning around.</i>

541
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:40,224
- We're just three guys drivin' down the road in a blizzard.
- All right.

542
00:41:40,331 --> 00:41:44,791
Nothin' to get nervous about. All right?

543
00:41:47,771 --> 00:41:50,035
<i>He's comin'after us.</i>

544
00:41:50,107 --> 00:41:54,601
- Oh, no, no, no, no. He's gaining on us.
- Just relax.

545
00:41:54,678 --> 00:41:57,272
<i>- Yes. - What?
- I see it.</i>

546
00:41:57,348 --> 00:42:00,215
- He's gaining on us.
- Who cares? Alvin, step on it!

547
00:42:00,284 --> 00:42:04,812
- I don't have any snow chains.
- The cop is comin' after us. The cop is comin' after us!

548
00:42:04,889 --> 00:42:06,982
Are you out of your mind?
Go!

549
00:42:09,059 --> 00:42:11,994
- Hurry up!
- Just be cool. Lay back.

550
00:42:43,060 --> 00:42:45,119
Ow!

551
00:42:45,796 --> 00:42:47,855
Oh, Ow!

552
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:52,825
Ooh! That hurt.

553
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:56,896
<i>- Oww!
- You all right?</i>

554
00:42:57,007 --> 00:42:59,942
Eh, I didn't have
snow chains.

555
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:03,513
- You have no brain either.
- Hey! You guys all right?

556
00:43:03,581 --> 00:43:07,142
- Who the hell is that?
- You just shut up, and let me do the talking.

557
00:43:10,087 --> 00:43:13,079
- Wha-- What happened?
- Our car ran off the road.

558
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:17,287
- Oh, my God! Are you okay?
- Well, we're not dead, if that's what you mean.

559
00:43:17,361 --> 00:43:21,491
- Didn't have snow chains!
- Look, you guys are gonna freeze out here.

560
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:24,625
- You better get in my car fast!
- Can you take us to the interstate?

561
00:43:24,735 --> 00:43:27,727
<i>No! No, the roads to
the interstate are closed.</i>

562
00:43:27,838 --> 00:43:31,103
- Can you take us anywhere?
- You're gonna be singing at my aunt and uncle's soon.

563
00:43:31,175 --> 00:43:33,541
You may as well
brush up here, okay?

564
00:44:09,179 --> 00:44:11,147
- Dick!
- Uncle Cliff.

565
00:44:11,215 --> 00:44:14,309
- Aah! Oh.
- Oh, you okay?

566
00:44:14,385 --> 00:44:16,444
I'm sorry.
I just stubbed my toe.

567
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:19,717
- Oh, dear.
- I'm sorry it took me so long getting here.

568
00:44:19,790 --> 00:44:22,554
<i>This is Bill,
Dave and Alvin Firpo.</i>

569
00:44:27,464 --> 00:44:31,764
Gee, Ed. Those were the guys
that were in our store, aren't they?

570
00:44:31,835 --> 00:44:35,703
By God, Clovis,
that's very observant of you.

571
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:40,039
You know, it's a good thing
they made us deputies, Clovis.

572
00:44:40,110 --> 00:44:43,443
They had an accident up at Hastings.
I decided I'd bring them with me.

573
00:44:43,514 --> 00:44:46,142
- Oh, dear! Well, come on in.
- I hope you don't mind.

574
00:44:46,216 --> 00:44:48,377
Not at all.
Come on in out of the cold.

575
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:50,852
<i>- Thank you. That's very kind.
- Dick's here. He brought some guests.</i>

576
00:44:50,921 --> 00:44:52,912
<i>Merry Christmas.</i>

577
00:44:52,990 --> 00:44:55,254
Think he'll remember us?

578
00:44:55,392 --> 00:44:59,852
- Can I take your bag?
- No! Hah!

579
00:44:59,963 --> 00:45:01,931
This is Mrs. Anderson.

580
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:05,468
These guys had an accident up the road.
I decided to bring 'em over here.

581
00:45:05,536 --> 00:45:07,470
Oh.

582
00:45:07,538 --> 00:45:10,473
I remember you from
the bank this morning.

583
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:19,514
- How do you mean?
- Oh, I'm sorry.

584
00:45:19,583 --> 00:45:22,177
I don't mean to come off
like I'm interrogating you...

585
00:45:22,252 --> 00:45:25,744
but the bank was robbed
this afternoon...

586
00:45:25,823 --> 00:45:29,816
- by three men.
- And on Christmas Eve?

587
00:45:29,893 --> 00:45:32,020
Well... what's this world
coming to?

588
00:45:32,096 --> 00:45:35,463
<i>Well, of course, I saw you talking
with Sarah Upstairs...</i>

589
00:45:35,566 --> 00:45:38,296
so I knew you
were all right.

590
00:45:39,803 --> 00:45:41,771
Upstairs?

591
00:45:41,872 --> 00:45:45,808
<i>Oh, we call her Sarah
Upstairs. She rents a room from us.</i>

592
00:45:45,876 --> 00:45:48,811
<i>She's been here
a couple of years now. Heh!</i>

593
00:45:48,879 --> 00:45:51,939
That is... terrific.

594
00:45:52,015 --> 00:45:55,075
These poor gentlemen.
First they get run off the road...

595
00:45:55,152 --> 00:45:58,588
and now we're practically
accusing them of being bank robbers.

596
00:45:58,655 --> 00:46:01,283
- Oh!
- I think they've had enough excitement for one day.

597
00:46:01,358 --> 00:46:03,883
- Don't you?
- You got that right, Mrs. A.

598
00:46:03,961 --> 00:46:07,226
Oh, Mrs.--
I like that.

599
00:46:07,331 --> 00:46:09,629
Oh, Aunt Hetty, um, I'm sorry.
I hope you don't mind.

600
00:46:09,733 --> 00:46:13,032
I told these gentlemen
I could get 'em a change of clothes.

601
00:46:19,643 --> 00:46:23,477
- No, no, no. - One
for you. - Thank you.

602
00:46:26,650 --> 00:46:29,744
Look, you can't do this.
These are from your wife, obviously.

603
00:46:29,820 --> 00:46:33,551
Yes, that's right. Now I'm giving them
to you. Merry Christmas, boys.

604
00:46:33,624 --> 00:46:36,889
<i>- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.</i>

605
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,760
Oh, my goodness, son.
Your lip is bleeding.

606
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:43,731
Oh, my God. I must need some
ointment or whatnot.

607
00:46:43,801 --> 00:46:46,429
<i>- He's all right. - Do you
got any-- What do you call it--</i>

608
00:46:46,537 --> 00:46:49,005
<i>- ointment or somethin'?
- He's all right.</i>

609
00:46:49,072 --> 00:46:51,905
<i>- Oh, no. We'll take care of him right away.
- He's all right.</i>

610
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:55,138
- Don't be long.
- I need ointment!

611
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:59,808
<i>- What's in it?
- Oh,you'll have to open it to find out.</i>

612
00:46:59,883 --> 00:47:04,149
Is it clothes?
I hope they fit.

613
00:47:04,221 --> 00:47:08,248
- Sarah Upstairs.
- Sarah Upstairs.

614
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:11,920
<i>- I guess I should say Sarah Downstairs.
- 'Cause now I'm downstairs.</i>

615
00:47:11,995 --> 00:47:15,328
- When you're Upstairs, you're up.
- And--

616
00:47:15,432 --> 00:47:18,560
So what are you doing here?

617
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:22,765
Uh, it's another long and miserable story
that I'd rather not get into right now.

618
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:26,276
<i>- There's a three-legged dog over there
staring at me. - Oh, that's tripod.</i>

619
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:29,972
We named him Tripod.

620
00:47:30,013 --> 00:47:34,006
He was a stray, he was hit by a truck,
and, you know, we took him in.

621
00:47:34,084 --> 00:47:36,917
<i>Poor doggie.</i>

622
00:47:36,987 --> 00:47:41,083
<i>- Oh, you know, you look damp.
You must be cold.</i>

623
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:44,423
<i>- Why don't you change, or--
- Three on each side? Okay.</i>

624
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:47,292
You know, wash up a little.
Get warm.

625
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:51,333
With interstate 95
being the only major road still open.

626
00:47:51,435 --> 00:47:54,996
<i>The storm dumped 14 inches
in Chicago before moving east.</i>

627
00:47:55,105 --> 00:47:58,597
<i>There have been seven deaths
attributed to the weather so far.</i>

628
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:00,609
What are you watchin',
Marla?

629
00:48:00,677 --> 00:48:03,646
- Oh,just a little TV.
- A daring prison break at Long Island State Prison in New York.

630
00:48:03,714 --> 00:48:08,947
<i>Two inmates took advantage of what is being
called the worst blizzard in 17 years...</i>

631
00:48:09,019 --> 00:48:12,352
overpowering three guards
and hijacking a laundry truck.

632
00:48:12,422 --> 00:48:15,858
An all-points bulletin has been issued--

633
00:48:21,098 --> 00:48:25,000
Oh ho! That's the spirit
we need in this house!

634
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:32,538
- Whoa! Oh!

635
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:38,243
- What is wrong with you?
- I'm just feelin' good.

636
00:48:38,315 --> 00:48:42,149
I'm feeling so good, I'm gonna call our
Ma. Mrs. Anderson, can we call our mother?

637
00:48:42,219 --> 00:48:45,382
Oh, oh, certainly, dear.
It's in the hall.

638
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:49,152
Okay, okay. Bill, come on. Let's
call her. I'm dying to hear from her.

639
00:48:49,226 --> 00:48:52,252
What the hell's
the matter with you?

640
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:55,526
Singing at the top of your lungs,
jumping around like Fred Astaire!

641
00:48:55,632 --> 00:48:58,100
I got carried away
by the Christmas spirit.

642
00:48:58,168 --> 00:49:01,365
I'm sorry I'm not
a deadbeat like you, Bill. Huh!

643
00:49:05,208 --> 00:49:07,768
You are really
getting paranoid.

644
00:49:10,113 --> 00:49:12,081
- Hello, Ma?
- Dave?

645
00:49:12,149 --> 00:49:14,242
<i>- Hey!
- Ooh!</i>

646
00:49:14,318 --> 00:49:18,015
If you don't give me that money, I'm
gonna throw your mother out the window!

647
00:49:18,088 --> 00:49:21,251
- I don't think she can fly, can she?
- Oh, no, no, no.

648
00:49:21,325 --> 00:49:23,691
Flying would be out of the question,
especially in this weather.

649
00:49:23,760 --> 00:49:26,285
- What's the problem?
- She wants to fly down here.

650
00:49:26,363 --> 00:49:30,823
- Did you rob that bank?
- Ah! What an imagination!

651
00:49:30,901 --> 00:49:34,268
- Let me talk to her.
- No. You know what she's like when she gets this way.

652
00:49:34,338 --> 00:49:36,431
- She's mad at you.
- She's mad at me?

653
00:49:36,506 --> 00:49:39,566
- Yeah. Let me take care of it.
- Where are you, goddamn it?

654
00:49:39,643 --> 00:49:44,012
Your mother said you went to Pennsylvania. You
got snowed in, didn't you, you dumb bastard?

655
00:49:44,081 --> 00:49:46,515
- Don't you call me-- Now,
you listen to me-- - All right.

656
00:49:46,583 --> 00:49:48,983
Wait a sec. Now, Ma, now,
you listen to me.

657
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:51,111
Now, do us both a favor.
Don't do anything you'll regret.

658
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:54,248
When the road clears,
we'll come down.

659
00:49:54,324 --> 00:49:57,157
We're not gonna hurt her,
as long as you do the right thing.

660
00:49:57,227 --> 00:49:59,661
All right, all right.
Love you too.

661
00:50:01,832 --> 00:50:05,324
- Oh! Oh, did you want to talk to her?
- Yes, I wanted to talk to her!

662
00:50:05,435 --> 00:50:09,201
<i>I'm takin'some cranberry sauce. It's
Christmas. What did that idiot say to ya?</i>

663
00:50:09,272 --> 00:50:11,638
He said he loved me.

664
00:50:11,708 --> 00:50:14,438
That is right. I thought so too.

665
00:50:14,511 --> 00:50:17,571
She is
a funny lady. How you guys doin'?

666
00:50:17,647 --> 00:50:20,480
You know what? They got some kinda
feast out there, I'm tellin' ya.

667
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:23,246
- Wait till you see the giblet gravy.
- No, Alvin.

668
00:50:23,320 --> 00:50:26,721
We're going to be eating giblets in
Attica if we don't get out of here.

669
00:50:26,790 --> 00:50:30,055
Boys. Boys, the dinner
will be ready in 10 minutes.

670
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:33,255
- You better go take your showers.
- You got it, Mrs. A.

671
00:50:33,363 --> 00:50:35,664
Mrs. A!

672
00:50:35,699 --> 00:50:39,260
<i>Oh, Mrs. A? Somethin' smells good.</i>

673
00:50:39,336 --> 00:50:44,467
- Nothin' better than that smell in the whole, wide world.
- It does smell good.

674
00:50:44,541 --> 00:50:48,500
- Yeah. It smells good.
- We got the beginnings of a real situation here.

675
00:50:48,578 --> 00:50:52,105
I just robbed these people.
I don't want to get to know them.

676
00:50:52,215 --> 00:50:54,183
Clove...

677
00:50:55,218 --> 00:50:57,448
I sense
a conspiracy here.

678
00:50:58,455 --> 00:51:01,822
- Let's radio the Feds.
- l--

679
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,951
Clovis...

680
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:06,996
you know what you are?

681
00:51:07,064 --> 00:51:09,032
What?

682
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:11,124
- An alarmist.
- I am?

683
00:51:11,201 --> 00:51:14,534
Yes, you are. And that's not
a good thing to be.

684
00:51:14,604 --> 00:51:17,664
- It's not?
- No, it's not...

685
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:20,175
especially when all
this money's at stake.

686
00:51:20,277 --> 00:51:26,147
Bill, would you, uh-- would you
please pass me the giblet gravy?

687
00:51:28,452 --> 00:51:33,355
Thank you. Oh.
There's some scallions in there.

688
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:36,290
You know,
Mr. and Mrs. Anderson...

689
00:51:36,359 --> 00:51:39,658
I wanted to say my appreciation
for your hospitableness.

690
00:51:39,729 --> 00:51:42,357
Heh heh! 'Cause I love these giblets.
Look at that.

691
00:51:42,432 --> 00:51:44,866
<i>Scallions too. But anyway...</i>

692
00:51:44,935 --> 00:51:48,132
I just certainly hope we haven't
exposed ourselves upon you.

693
00:51:48,205 --> 00:51:50,469
No, no. Not at all.

694
00:51:50,540 --> 00:51:53,168
No. It's been a nice
diversion having you three with us.

695
00:51:53,243 --> 00:51:58,579
Mm. Otherwise, we'd just be sitting
around, talking about that terrible robbery.

696
00:51:58,648 --> 00:52:02,209
Mr. Anderson, if you don't mind
my asking,

697
00:52:02,319 --> 00:52:04,787
exactly how much
was taken?

698
00:52:04,855 --> 00:52:09,189
- No. They just said they don't
want to talk about it, Dave. - Ehh--

699
00:52:09,259 --> 00:52:14,526
Well, $275,000.

700
00:52:14,598 --> 00:52:17,897
See, I heard that banks
always claim...

701
00:52:17,968 --> 00:52:21,131
uh,
that more was stolen...

702
00:52:21,204 --> 00:52:25,197
than actually was
so they could claim double...

703
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:28,767
<i>- on the insurance.
- Only a crook would do a thing like that.</i>

704
00:52:28,879 --> 00:52:32,315
That would make me no different
from the people who robbed me.

705
00:52:42,125 --> 00:52:44,650
Yeah, but what about puttin'
all the people to work?

706
00:52:44,728 --> 00:52:47,925
You know, 'cause you have to have all
that extra security and everything.

707
00:52:47,998 --> 00:52:52,059
In fact, I heard that bank robberies
actually stimulate the economy.

708
00:52:52,135 --> 00:52:54,626
You're enormously misinformed,
Mr. Firpo.

709
00:52:54,704 --> 00:52:59,539
The truth is that this robbery will probably
put this little bank out of business.

710
00:52:59,609 --> 00:53:01,600
<i>How's that?</i>

711
00:53:03,947 --> 00:53:07,747
Well, for years now, these big-city
banks have been threatening to come in...

712
00:53:07,817 --> 00:53:10,650
wanting to take us over.

713
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:14,588
And now with this robbery,
the F.D.I.C. will come in...

714
00:53:14,658 --> 00:53:19,618
and investigate, and find that I make
loans to people just on a handshake.

715
00:53:19,696 --> 00:53:22,028
There's really
no collateral at all.

716
00:53:22,098 --> 00:53:24,589
And that, gentlemen,
will be the end of that.

717
00:53:24,668 --> 00:53:28,229
Well... excuse me,
Mr. Anderson, but...

718
00:53:28,305 --> 00:53:31,240
I can't pretend to know
too much about these matters.

719
00:53:31,308 --> 00:53:35,335
However, if what you say is
true-- which, I'm sure it is--

720
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:38,642
um, then how could the bank
have so much cash on hand?

721
00:53:40,150 --> 00:53:43,051
Well, now,
that's the worst part of it.

722
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:45,747
<i>That's a once-a-year deal.</i>

723
00:53:45,822 --> 00:53:51,317
Over the years, I've persuaded everybody in
town to open up a little Christmas club account.

724
00:53:51,394 --> 00:53:55,160
<i>You know, nothing much, but at the end
of year, everybody has a few extra dollars.</i>

725
00:53:55,232 --> 00:54:00,226
It adds up. It gives everybody
a little extra security and pride.

726
00:54:00,303 --> 00:54:03,101
It kept Main Street alive.

727
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:06,098
Not this year.

728
00:54:06,176 --> 00:54:09,907
No, sir. Not this year.

729
00:54:16,119 --> 00:54:20,180
I just called the bus station. There's a road
to the south open that's going to Philly.

730
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:24,660
- Oh, that's excellent.
- Philadelphia? That's a little out of our way, don't you think?

731
00:54:24,728 --> 00:54:29,062
Alvin, there's a train from Philly
to New York. It takes a couple hours.

732
00:54:29,132 --> 00:54:32,499
<i>- Might get there by midnight.
- If you'd like to catch it, we should probably go now.</i>

733
00:54:32,569 --> 00:54:35,663
- I think so.
- Oh. Well, I'll make you some sandwiches.

734
00:54:35,739 --> 00:54:38,731
No, no. We're fine.
Thank you so much for your hospitality.

735
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:41,299
Do you need any money?

736
00:54:41,378 --> 00:54:43,608
- No, we couldn't. - No,
we couldn't. - No, no.

737
00:54:43,713 --> 00:54:47,547
- No. We've taken more than our share already.
- No, no. Here. You take this.

738
00:54:47,617 --> 00:54:50,518
- You take this and have a nice, happy, safe,
- Mrs. A, please.

739
00:54:50,587 --> 00:54:52,646
eh--

740
00:54:54,424 --> 00:54:57,757
- Don't forget those coats. Merry Christmas.
- Thank you. Merry Christmas.

741
00:54:57,827 --> 00:55:00,489
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

742
00:55:00,563 --> 00:55:02,861
- Come again any time.
- Thanks for the suit.

743
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:29,492
Thank you. Thank you
for my festive sweater.

744
00:55:29,527 --> 00:55:32,825
Looks like they're
going somewhere.

745
00:55:34,030 --> 00:55:36,999
Figured that out,
did you?

746
00:55:37,100 --> 00:55:39,796
Did you see the way he was
holding that duffle bag?

747
00:55:39,869 --> 00:55:42,064
How?

748
00:55:42,138 --> 00:55:45,335
The same way I would:
close to my heart.

749
00:55:47,010 --> 00:55:48,944
<i>We're going for the money.
We're not waiting for nobody.</i>

750
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:50,946
<i>- Right.
- What are you saying?</i>

751
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:53,813
That my boys wouldn't
come back and save me?

752
00:55:53,883 --> 00:55:58,217
That they'd rather have a couple of
hundred-thousand bucks over a mother's love?

753
00:55:58,288 --> 00:56:01,655
I wouldn't pay three bucks for you.

754
00:56:01,758 --> 00:56:03,692
Can I ask you
a personal question?

755
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:07,719
What were you doing
five years for? Stupidity?

756
00:56:07,831 --> 00:56:10,197
Hey, Edna, how'd you like to ride
in the trunk of the car?

757
00:56:10,266 --> 00:56:13,895
''Edna''? ''Edna''?
Are we sleeping together? I think not.

758
00:56:13,970 --> 00:56:16,438
You call me Mrs. Firpo,
goddamn it.

759
00:56:16,506 --> 00:56:20,135
- Don't aggravate the old witch.
- I wish I was a witch.

760
00:56:20,210 --> 00:56:22,508
I'd shove my broomstick
right up your ass.

761
00:56:22,579 --> 00:56:26,106
I'll say whatever I want.
Do you like music?

762
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:29,515
- Oh,Jesus.

763
00:56:45,568 --> 00:56:47,559
Thanks a lot.

764
00:56:53,042 --> 00:56:55,510
I don't see snow chains.

765
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:59,173
This was very nice of you.
Please tell the Andersons--

766
00:57:01,050 --> 00:57:03,644
- What was that about?
- I have no idea.

767
00:57:03,720 --> 00:57:07,281
All right. I'll get the tickets.
You two separate.

768
00:57:07,357 --> 00:57:11,316
- ''Separate''?
- Just pretend like you don't know each other.

769
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,363
- Do I know you?
- No.

770
00:57:14,431 --> 00:57:16,626
- You look familiar.
- Well, I'm not.

771
00:57:16,699 --> 00:57:18,667
- Come here.
- Get away from me, you nut.

772
00:57:24,674 --> 00:57:27,404
Can't let 'em
get on that bus.

773
00:57:27,477 --> 00:57:29,411
We're gonna take
that money.

774
00:57:29,479 --> 00:57:32,141
You sure this is
the right thing to do, Ed?

775
00:57:35,185 --> 00:57:37,176
Say, ''Spill
on aisle three.''

776
00:57:39,923 --> 00:57:41,948
Spill on aisle three.

777
00:57:42,058 --> 00:57:44,288
- You wanna be saying that the rest of your life?
- No, I don't.

778
00:57:44,394 --> 00:57:47,090
- Then help me get that money.
- Okay.

779
00:57:51,835 --> 00:57:56,204
You're not gonna believe this,
but I don't-- I don't have enough money.

780
00:57:57,774 --> 00:58:00,242
Wait a minute.

781
00:58:22,131 --> 00:58:24,827
<i>Hi, sweetie.</i>

782
00:58:28,104 --> 00:58:30,664
- Any luck?
- No.

783
00:58:30,740 --> 00:58:34,801
What am l--

784
00:58:34,878 --> 00:58:37,506
What am I gonna... do?

785
00:58:38,915 --> 00:58:42,146
Huh?
That's my bus.

786
00:58:42,218 --> 00:58:46,382
- Going home to your fammily?
- No,just my mother actually.

787
00:58:59,903 --> 00:59:03,100
<i>Please-- Please, I can't--</i>

788
00:59:03,172 --> 00:59:07,165
I mean, I want it.
I can't accept it.

789
00:59:07,243 --> 00:59:09,803
I do--
No, I can't.

790
00:59:09,879 --> 00:59:13,576
You're lucky you're in Paradise.
Merry Christmas, sir.

791
00:59:22,191 --> 00:59:25,388
<i>- Why don't you wait inside?
- Excuse me.</i>

792
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:28,362
He's got our money,
Clovis.

793
00:59:29,699 --> 00:59:32,532
- Can I check your bags?
- Let's see what's in the bag.

794
00:59:32,602 --> 00:59:34,934
- What?
- F.B.I. The bag.

795
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:38,633
- ''The bag''?
- The bag, sir.

796
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:41,939
- Hey!
- Get him! Take him down!

797
00:59:42,011 --> 00:59:44,445
<i>Freeze! Freeze!</i>

798
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:47,779
- Don't move.
- Oh, shit!

799
00:59:53,122 --> 00:59:55,056
Oh, my God, a gun!

800
00:59:55,158 --> 00:59:59,094
- Oh, God, he's got a gun!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

801
00:59:59,195 --> 01:00:02,289
<i>You got the wrong guy!
It's the guy with the floppy ears!</i>

802
01:00:02,398 --> 01:00:04,559
Let's go.

803
01:00:04,634 --> 01:00:07,034
<i>What happened?</i>

804
01:00:07,103 --> 01:00:10,470
No! No! No!

805
01:00:16,546 --> 01:00:19,310
- What's going on here?
- We may have found two of our suspects.

806
01:00:19,382 --> 01:00:21,350
All right, all right,
all right.

807
01:00:22,919 --> 01:00:25,547
- Oh, shit.
- What? You know him?

808
01:00:25,622 --> 01:00:29,388
Yeah, unfortunately.
That's Ed Dawson and Clovis Minor.

809
01:00:29,492 --> 01:00:32,859
- They're both my deputies.
- Hey, how you doin', fellas?

810
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:49,404
That, by God, was close.
That was close.

811
01:00:49,479 --> 01:00:51,777
Now our ride's gone.
Shit!

812
01:00:51,848 --> 01:00:54,612
- What the hell happened back there?
- I have no idea!

813
01:00:54,684 --> 01:00:58,142
I don't like this.

814
01:00:58,221 --> 01:01:00,314
We're screwed.

815
01:01:00,390 --> 01:01:02,688
Come on. Y-Y-You gotta think
of a way to get us out of here.

816
01:01:02,792 --> 01:01:07,525
All right!
Quit pressuring me, please!

817
01:01:07,597 --> 01:01:12,660
Look, there's only one way I can think
of that's gonna get us out of here...

818
01:01:12,735 --> 01:01:14,669
and it's a longshot.

819
01:01:14,737 --> 01:01:16,932
Let me get this straight.

820
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:20,772
- You had no idea what was going on in that bus station.
- No, sir.

821
01:01:20,843 --> 01:01:23,676
Your gun just happened to go off
three times in a row by itself.

822
01:01:23,746 --> 01:01:28,843
No. I thought what I saw
might be a suspect.

823
01:01:28,918 --> 01:01:33,719
So, maybe my partner Clovis
and I got a little...

824
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:36,987
over-anticapatory.

825
01:01:37,093 --> 01:01:41,655
<i>Agent Peyser-- Excuse me.
Will you guys knock it off,please?</i>

826
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:45,700
<i>Just put the ball away for now.
Thank you.</i>

827
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:50,603
These kids tell me they saw three guys
push a car into the river this afternoon.

828
01:01:50,673 --> 01:01:55,542
- They tell me they can show us the exact spot.
- Hallelujah. Huh?

829
01:01:58,414 --> 01:02:01,178
- Are you coming along with us?
- No, no, no. Not you two.

830
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,878
Just stay out
of my sight.

831
01:02:03,953 --> 01:02:06,444
Will you just cool it?

832
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:34,249
<i>You know, I just hate to ruin
this Hallmark moment.</i>

833
01:02:34,317 --> 01:02:38,378
Would you get over here and help me
lug this boat to the river!

834
01:03:07,049 --> 01:03:08,983
That's it.
We're done being nice to you.

835
01:03:09,051 --> 01:03:11,952
<i>Get out,you pain in the ass.
I've had it with you.</i>

836
01:03:12,021 --> 01:03:14,512
Enough is enough.
Come on. Get out.

837
01:03:14,590 --> 01:03:17,320
- You call this being nice?
- This is as nice as we're gonna get.

838
01:03:17,426 --> 01:03:21,522
Putting a gun to my head and dragging me across
three states on the night Christ was born.

839
01:03:21,631 --> 01:03:25,931
- Gag her.
- You're doing me a goddamn favor!

840
01:03:26,002 --> 01:03:27,799
You think this is torture?

841
01:03:27,870 --> 01:03:31,567
Anything's better than looking at you two
gorillas and listening to your horse shit.

842
01:03:31,641 --> 01:03:35,077
- Just get in the trunk.
- You guys are dumber than a box of hair.

843
01:03:35,144 --> 01:03:38,602
<i>- Gag her!
- Oh, cut it out. You can't--</i>

844
01:03:38,681 --> 01:03:41,206
<i>Good night, Edna.</i>

845
01:03:42,852 --> 01:03:45,878
Hey, we made it!

846
01:03:45,955 --> 01:03:50,085
Come on. The harder we row,
the faster we go. Come on!

847
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:53,928
Wha-- Wait a minute.
What?

848
01:03:53,996 --> 01:03:57,432
- Bill, you're a genius.
- Yeah, but in the Firpo family...

849
01:03:57,533 --> 01:03:59,467
the man with
half a brain is king.

850
01:03:59,535 --> 01:04:01,867
Come on. Row, row!
Like a Viking, Alvin!

851
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:04,099
- Row! Row!
- Like a Viking!

852
01:04:05,107 --> 01:04:07,905
Alvin!

853
01:04:07,977 --> 01:04:11,504
<i>- Alvin!
- Alvin, come back!</i>

854
01:04:14,617 --> 01:04:17,381
<i>Help! Help!</i>

855
01:04:21,724 --> 01:04:25,319
Help! Help! Help!

856
01:04:28,231 --> 01:04:32,463
Help!

857
01:04:34,170 --> 01:04:36,035
Down this side.
This side.

858
01:04:36,105 --> 01:04:41,099
<i>Help! Help!</i>

859
01:04:42,778 --> 01:04:44,678
- Look.
- Over here.

860
01:04:44,747 --> 01:04:47,215
Over by the rock.

861
01:04:47,283 --> 01:04:49,649
There's a man in the water.

862
01:04:49,719 --> 01:04:52,779
- Here.
- Hang on. We're gonna get you out of there.

863
01:04:52,855 --> 01:04:56,052
Hold on, Alvin!

864
01:04:56,158 --> 01:04:58,626
- Oh!
- I got ya.

865
01:05:00,162 --> 01:05:02,096
- Hang on, son.
- Give me a hand.

866
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:05,258
Hang on!
Grab my hand!

867
01:05:05,334 --> 01:05:08,098
<i>Alvin, grab his hand!</i>

868
01:05:09,338 --> 01:05:12,171
<i>Come on.
Just grab it.</i>

869
01:05:12,241 --> 01:05:16,041
<i>- Give him your hand.
- I got him!</i>

870
01:05:16,112 --> 01:05:18,580
<i>Right in this room.</i>

871
01:05:18,648 --> 01:05:20,912
<i>Lay him down by the fire.</i>

872
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:29,317
Oh, Christ.
He looks like he's turning blue.

873
01:05:29,425 --> 01:05:32,019
- What's that mean?
- He's got water in his lungs.

874
01:05:32,128 --> 01:05:34,995
Just stay back there.
Give me some room here.

875
01:05:35,064 --> 01:05:39,160
<i>Come on, son. Spit some of
that stuff out of there. Come on.</i>

876
01:05:39,235 --> 01:05:41,100
Come on. There.

877
01:05:58,654 --> 01:06:01,316
<i>That means he's
going to be all right.</i>

878
01:06:01,390 --> 01:06:04,359
- Who are you?
- I'm Fred.

879
01:06:04,427 --> 01:06:06,395
- Flinstone?
- Yes.

880
01:06:08,164 --> 01:06:10,428
There.
He'll be all right now.

881
01:06:10,499 --> 01:06:12,831
How about a little soup
and brandy?

882
01:06:12,902 --> 01:06:16,668
- Mix the two together?
- No, the brandy's for me.

883
01:06:16,739 --> 01:06:18,673
Oh.

884
01:06:18,741 --> 01:06:21,869
I think we lucked out
with those kids.

885
01:06:21,944 --> 01:06:24,003
- Boy, the car's soaked good.
- Yeah.

886
01:06:24,080 --> 01:06:26,014
<i>Let's roll it over.
We gotta get it in the truck.</i>

887
01:06:26,082 --> 01:06:27,515
<i>- Anybody got a crowbar?
- Yeah.</i>

888
01:06:27,583 --> 01:06:29,813
<i>- Get it.
- We gotta get a crowbar here, okay?</i>

889
01:06:33,222 --> 01:06:35,281
Give me some light.

890
01:06:36,492 --> 01:06:38,983
Might find a walleye in there.
See anything?

891
01:06:39,095 --> 01:06:42,758
No. Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

892
01:06:43,966 --> 01:06:47,663
- What the hell are those things?
- Ski masks.

893
01:06:47,737 --> 01:06:50,535
Merry Christmas!

894
01:06:50,606 --> 01:06:53,666
- Thank you. That's sweet of you.
- Thank you very much.

895
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:56,576
That's my sister.
You know.

896
01:06:56,645 --> 01:06:58,909
I don't think you'll be able
to smoke when we go into church.

897
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:00,846
I wanna thank you
for saving my life.

898
01:07:00,916 --> 01:07:02,850
You know, almost drowning
and everything.

899
01:07:02,918 --> 01:07:04,852
Oh, you don't have to
put it out now.

900
01:07:04,920 --> 01:07:07,286
You could have puffed
a little longer.

901
01:07:07,356 --> 01:07:09,290
Oh, this is nice.

902
01:07:14,663 --> 01:07:18,463
- Look, there's Timmy.
- Merry Christmas, Timmy.

903
01:07:18,498 --> 01:07:22,263
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas to you.

904
01:07:22,338 --> 01:07:25,171
I thought you boys were on your way
to Philadelphia.

905
01:07:25,241 --> 01:07:28,176
Well, the bus
left without us.

906
01:07:28,244 --> 01:07:31,179
- Oh, well. Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

907
01:07:31,247 --> 01:07:33,977
<i>- Can I talk to you a minute?
- Merry Christmas, Father.</i>

908
01:07:36,452 --> 01:07:39,046
I'm going to confession.

909
01:07:39,155 --> 01:07:42,386
They don't have confession.
They're Protestants.

910
01:07:42,458 --> 01:07:45,791
- Are you shitting me?
- No.

911
01:07:45,861 --> 01:07:49,456
I don't care. I'm going in anyway.

912
01:07:49,532 --> 01:07:54,799
All right. I'll be out here
with the... do-re-me.

913
01:07:56,205 --> 01:07:58,139
Why are you
still here?

914
01:07:58,207 --> 01:08:00,072
Why am I still here?
What?

915
01:08:00,142 --> 01:08:02,576
You sound like you're anxious
to get rid of us. What's the matter?

916
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:06,137
- I just wish you'd go.
- Why is that?

917
01:08:06,248 --> 01:08:10,878
You know, I think you did
something stupid today.

918
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:13,318
Something you
may regret.

919
01:08:13,389 --> 01:08:15,755
Your last name
isn't Collins, is it?

920
01:08:15,825 --> 01:08:18,817
No. No,
it's not.

921
01:08:18,894 --> 01:08:23,058
I've lied to a lot of people I care about,
so please,just go while you can.

922
01:08:31,073 --> 01:08:33,007
Sarah.

923
01:08:34,376 --> 01:08:37,641
I can't.

924
01:08:37,713 --> 01:08:39,772
You can't what?

925
01:08:39,882 --> 01:08:43,784
- I can't leave knowing what I know.
- What are you saying?

926
01:08:43,853 --> 01:08:48,347
I'm saying-- I'm saying
I like these people too.

927
01:08:48,457 --> 01:08:52,325
I like them too. And I wish that I could think
of something to make this all better.

928
01:08:54,096 --> 01:08:56,530
Maybe you're not
thinking hard enough.

929
01:08:58,334 --> 01:09:01,269
Look, can I ask you
a question?

930
01:09:02,338 --> 01:09:04,465
Do you think people change?

931
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:07,031
Do you believe a person can be
on one road their whole life...

932
01:09:07,109 --> 01:09:09,703
and then just back up
and take another?

933
01:09:09,778 --> 01:09:14,738
- I think that all depends.
- Depends... on the road.

934
01:09:14,850 --> 01:09:16,818
It depends on the person.

935
01:09:18,721 --> 01:09:20,655
Depends on the person.

936
01:09:22,224 --> 01:09:24,158
Depends on the person.

937
01:09:30,699 --> 01:09:32,633
This headstone says Anderson.

938
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:36,370
Is that any relation?

939
01:09:38,340 --> 01:09:41,036
It's Clifford's
great-grandfather.

940
01:09:43,179 --> 01:09:45,704
<i>''1835-1892. ''</i>

941
01:09:47,149 --> 01:09:50,676
God. Your whole life's
in that dash, isn't it?

942
01:09:50,786 --> 01:09:52,845
Yeah.

943
01:09:56,592 --> 01:09:58,526
What are you doing?

944
01:09:59,595 --> 01:10:02,257
I don't know.

945
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:04,765
You don't know me.

946
01:10:04,833 --> 01:10:07,666
Sorry.

947
01:10:31,460 --> 01:10:37,365
- Easy, now. Easy, now, Merlin.
- Bill, get in. Whoa!

948
01:10:37,433 --> 01:10:40,925
Bill, 20 years minimum.
Get in.

949
01:10:41,003 --> 01:10:43,130
- Tell him to get in.
- I don't know about taking the kid's sleigh.

950
01:10:43,205 --> 01:10:46,697
- There's something ain't right about that.
- I'll get in.

951
01:10:46,775 --> 01:10:49,642
<i>After all these presents
and stuff.</i>

952
01:10:49,712 --> 01:10:51,577
<i>- Oh, no, cops!
- Hey!</i>

953
01:10:51,647 --> 01:10:54,741
<i>- Come on, Bill. Get in.
- Hey, that's Timmy's sleigh!</i>

954
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:58,047
What'd he call it?
Yahoo! Whoo!

955
01:10:58,120 --> 01:11:01,112
Come on, Merlin!
Come on! Come on!

956
01:11:01,223 --> 01:11:04,556
What do you call it? Gallop!
That's it! That's it! Come on! Come on!

957
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:16,629
<i>Come on! Come on!</i>

958
01:11:18,107 --> 01:11:20,598
Look out! Look out!
Get out of the way!

959
01:11:23,812 --> 01:11:25,780
Yahoo! Yahoo!

960
01:11:26,915 --> 01:11:29,850
Come on, Clovis.
I know a shortcut.

961
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:32,546
What's going on here?

962
01:11:32,655 --> 01:11:36,591
I don't know, but those three guys
stole my kid's horse and sleigh.

963
01:11:36,692 --> 01:11:41,493
<i>Merlin! Dad! Dad! Dad!</i>

964
01:11:41,563 --> 01:11:44,623
- Merlin! Dad! They took Merl--
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.

965
01:11:44,700 --> 01:11:48,192
<i>- Stay here! I know that!
- But, Dad, they took Merlin!</i>

966
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:05,687
<i>- Good shot.
- Hey, see you guys.</i>

967
01:12:05,754 --> 01:12:09,781
That wasn't fair! Hey!

968
01:12:09,858 --> 01:12:12,053
I hate this town.
I hate it.

969
01:12:12,127 --> 01:12:15,961
I hate it. Christmas Eve,
and my wife had the--

970
01:12:16,031 --> 01:12:20,127
I didn't get to see that thing pop up
on the turkey. I was-- I hate it.

971
01:12:22,971 --> 01:12:24,905
<i>A sleigh?
Catch the sleigh!</i>

972
01:12:24,973 --> 01:12:26,964
Faster! Faster!

973
01:12:27,042 --> 01:12:29,909
<i>Come on! Come on! Go!</i>

974
01:12:29,978 --> 01:12:32,105
Run! Run, Merlin! Run!

975
01:12:32,214 --> 01:12:36,207
- Whoo!
- Turn! Turn! To the right! Okay!

976
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:43,324
Whoa!

977
01:12:43,392 --> 01:12:46,520
Look out. Look out.
Jesus.

978
01:12:47,629 --> 01:12:49,563
Back up.
We're gonna lose them.

979
01:12:54,737 --> 01:12:56,671
<i>- Oh, God!
- Go, Alvin, go!</i>

980
01:12:58,741 --> 01:13:01,073
<i>- Go!
- Alvin, do you know what you're doing?</i>

981
01:13:01,143 --> 01:13:04,806
You do what you do, I do what I do!

982
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:06,871
Then hurry up!

983
01:13:08,083 --> 01:13:12,144
Go! Go! Go! Go!

984
01:13:22,931 --> 01:13:26,264
- Hi, Officer! Bye, Officer!
- Go! Yeah!

985
01:13:26,335 --> 01:13:28,235
Yes! Yes!

986
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:35,100
Oh, my God!

987
01:13:35,177 --> 01:13:37,668
Whoo!

988
01:13:37,746 --> 01:13:40,078
Unbelievable. Ow!
Unbelievable.

989
01:13:40,182 --> 01:13:44,118
<i>Come on. Keep going. Go.</i>

990
01:13:44,186 --> 01:13:47,155
- On 'em, on 'em, on 'em, on 'em, on 'em!
- Go! Go!

991
01:13:47,222 --> 01:13:49,156
<i>We got 'em. Come on!</i>

992
01:13:49,224 --> 01:13:52,159
<i>Run right up into them.</i>

993
01:13:52,227 --> 01:13:54,161
Right up into them.

994
01:14:17,186 --> 01:14:20,622
Whoa. Whoa.

995
01:14:30,499 --> 01:14:32,660
Hey, Merlin.

996
01:14:32,734 --> 01:14:34,668
Hey, thanks a lot, okay?

997
01:14:34,736 --> 01:14:36,670
We really appreciated it.

998
01:14:36,738 --> 01:14:39,673
I'm never gonna forget you.

999
01:14:39,741 --> 01:14:42,141
All right. You're a good horse.
Stay strong.

1000
01:14:48,784 --> 01:14:51,252
<i>Bill. Hey, Bill,
wait a minute.</i>

1001
01:14:52,454 --> 01:14:55,150
We can't leave him here.

1002
01:14:55,224 --> 01:15:00,059
<i>I mean, I couldn't live with myself
if I froze a horse, especially him.</i>

1003
01:15:00,128 --> 01:15:02,790
You're cracking up.
Both of you.

1004
01:15:02,865 --> 01:15:04,856
Come on.

1005
01:15:13,976 --> 01:15:16,968
<i>You stay there, Merlin. Stay there.</i>

1006
01:15:18,947 --> 01:15:22,610
Bill, we made it.
Alvin, we made it.

1007
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:26,415
All right. Let's all stick our thumbs out
and look pitiful.

1008
01:15:26,488 --> 01:15:30,083
- That should be easy.
- Easy. Pitiful. Thumbs.

1009
01:15:33,061 --> 01:15:37,555
- Hey, stop.
- Here we go. We're here.

1010
01:15:37,633 --> 01:15:40,261
- I can't tell you how happy I am.
- Hi. How are you?

1011
01:15:40,335 --> 01:15:42,530
<i>My name is Dave.</i>

1012
01:15:42,604 --> 01:15:46,267
<i>Oh, man.</i>

1013
01:15:46,341 --> 01:15:49,276
- We were out here skiing, and the back of it--
- Oh, man!

1014
01:15:49,344 --> 01:15:51,812
<i>No, no, no.</i>

1015
01:15:57,853 --> 01:15:59,548
All right. All right!

1016
01:15:59,621 --> 01:16:02,419
Oh, no!

1017
01:16:02,491 --> 01:16:05,358
<i>- Who needs you? Forget it.
- Hold on, Merlin!</i>

1018
01:16:05,427 --> 01:16:07,361
We're coming, Merlin!

1019
01:16:07,429 --> 01:16:10,421
<i>- We gotta get him out.
- You're not gonna die.</i>

1020
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:12,592
<i>You're not gonna die!</i>

1021
01:16:12,668 --> 01:16:16,627
- Cut it out! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Come on!

1022
01:16:16,705 --> 01:16:20,141
Hold him! He's coming! Get around his back!
Push him! Push him!

1023
01:16:20,208 --> 01:16:23,405
- Come on! Come on! Come on!
- Get him out of the water!

1024
01:16:23,478 --> 01:16:25,378
<i>- Push!
- Go! Go!</i>

1025
01:16:25,447 --> 01:16:29,406
<i>- Go!
- He's coming out!</i>

1026
01:16:40,929 --> 01:16:42,897
- Coffee?
- You bet.

1027
01:16:42,965 --> 01:16:46,128
<i>- Can I take your order now?
- I'm not quite sure.</i>

1028
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:01,415
Guys...

1029
01:17:01,483 --> 01:17:05,715
I still got the keys
to the vault on me.

1030
01:17:05,787 --> 01:17:11,453
I'm gonna go back to town,
and I'm gonna put the money back.

1031
01:17:17,799 --> 01:17:21,098
I know I didn't
hear you right.

1032
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:25,765
You can either come with me or not,
but that's what I'm doing.

1033
01:17:25,841 --> 01:17:30,403
Bill, I think that dunk
in the lake got to your brain.

1034
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:35,974
- You are not thinking clearly.
- No, I'm thinking very clearly.

1035
01:17:36,084 --> 01:17:38,518
You hear that?
Silent night, holy night.

1036
01:17:38,587 --> 01:17:40,851
''Adeste Fideles.''
''God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen.''

1037
01:17:40,922 --> 01:17:43,789
This is the best Christmas present
I could ever give to you.

1038
01:17:43,859 --> 01:17:47,727
I appreciate the sentiment.
You let me decide what I get for Christmas.

1039
01:17:47,796 --> 01:17:50,890
This money belongs
to me and Alvin too, you know.

1040
01:17:50,966 --> 01:17:54,367
It never belonged to us.
It belonged to the town.

1041
01:17:54,436 --> 01:17:56,597
What are you telling me?

1042
01:17:56,672 --> 01:17:59,436
That you are going to be
the first guy in history to get pinched...

1043
01:17:59,508 --> 01:18:01,976
<i>for putting money
back into a vault?</i>

1044
01:18:02,044 --> 01:18:05,411
If I get pinched, I get pinched.
That's the way that one went.

1045
01:18:05,480 --> 01:18:08,472
I'm not gonna sit here
and argue with you about it.

1046
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:13,044
- He's telling us what to do with our share of the money.
- Put my share back.

1047
01:18:17,759 --> 01:18:19,693
What is wrong with you guys?

1048
01:18:19,761 --> 01:18:22,525
You have a couple of eggnogs
with some farmers...

1049
01:18:22,597 --> 01:18:24,895
and now you wanna go back
and work for minumum wage?

1050
01:18:27,102 --> 01:18:29,093
- Make up your mind, 'cause I'm going.
- No, you're not.

1051
01:18:29,171 --> 01:18:31,332
You're not going!
You are still a wanted man in New York!

1052
01:18:31,406 --> 01:18:33,499
- No, he's not.
- Yes, he is!

1053
01:18:33,575 --> 01:18:38,740
No, he's not. All right?
It's over.

1054
01:18:40,982 --> 01:18:43,109
The whole thing...

1055
01:18:43,218 --> 01:18:45,846
was a... setup...

1056
01:18:45,954 --> 01:18:48,923
just to get you
down here.

1057
01:18:50,425 --> 01:18:52,518
Now, one other thing.

1058
01:18:54,362 --> 01:18:57,160
Does that look familiar?

1059
01:18:57,232 --> 01:18:59,393
It's a little wet...

1060
01:18:59,468 --> 01:19:02,198
but it's--

1061
01:19:02,270 --> 01:19:04,261
it's yours.

1062
01:19:07,042 --> 01:19:10,409
You never-- You never
did drop it.

1063
01:19:12,547 --> 01:19:14,845
What are you looking at?
What?

1064
01:19:16,952 --> 01:19:20,217
But there were ten million cops
at the restaurant.

1065
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,218
I did it.

1066
01:19:26,294 --> 01:19:28,489
I called them.

1067
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,591
I told them.

1068
01:19:34,870 --> 01:19:37,566
I told them there was
a sniper on the roof.

1069
01:19:48,550 --> 01:19:50,541
You all right?

1070
01:19:51,553 --> 01:19:54,454
Yeah, I'm all right.
Except--

1071
01:19:56,124 --> 01:19:58,058
Oh!

1072
01:19:58,160 --> 01:20:00,390
Sorry. Put the table
on their tab.

1073
01:20:00,495 --> 01:20:03,487
He's got the spirit,
don't he?

1074
01:20:03,598 --> 01:20:06,965
He handled that
pretty well.

1075
01:20:07,035 --> 01:20:09,299
Did you see
my Pez dispenser anywhere?

1076
01:20:09,371 --> 01:20:11,737
No. Shut up.
Check!

1077
01:20:11,807 --> 01:20:14,935
<i>- Hey, hey! Excuse me, sir.
I've got an emergency.</i>

1078
01:20:15,010 --> 01:20:17,478
- Are you headed towards Paradise?
- No, I'm going to New York.

1079
01:20:18,747 --> 01:20:21,545
Where were you
five hours ago?

1080
01:20:21,616 --> 01:20:24,813
- You going south?
- Nope.

1081
01:20:24,886 --> 01:20:28,117
<i>Hey, Edna,
can I get you anything?</i>

1082
01:20:28,190 --> 01:20:30,249
Come on. Don't take all night
putting this gas in.

1083
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:33,055
Excuse me. Would you mind telling me
which way you're headed?

1084
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:36,062
- Get outta here.
- It's an emergency. I've gotta get to Paradise.

1085
01:20:37,199 --> 01:20:39,133
We don't like
to ride with strangers.

1086
01:20:39,201 --> 01:20:41,965
- Come on, man. It's Christmas.
- What the hell.

1087
01:20:42,037 --> 01:20:44,870
A little company might be good.
Come on.Jump in.

1088
01:20:44,940 --> 01:20:47,306
- I told you not to say anything.
- I can keep a secret.

1089
01:20:47,375 --> 01:20:49,673
I told you to shut up, and you--
You're supposed to be on my side.

1090
01:20:49,744 --> 01:20:51,735
- Shit.
- What?

1091
01:20:51,813 --> 01:20:55,249
Oh, shit. Oh, shit.
Oh, shit.

1092
01:20:56,618 --> 01:20:58,609
Nice coat.
Who shot the couch?

1093
01:21:12,901 --> 01:21:16,393
- No, goddamn it! Sons of bitches!
- It's all right.

1094
01:21:21,076 --> 01:21:24,375
I can't tell you how much
I appreciate this, guys.

1095
01:21:24,446 --> 01:21:27,313
Rough night?

1096
01:21:27,382 --> 01:21:30,545
You have no idea
what kind of night I've had.

1097
01:21:30,619 --> 01:21:34,350
I'm just real lucky you're
going the same way as me.

1098
01:21:40,462 --> 01:21:44,125
- What's that banging noise?
- I don't hear nothing.

1099
01:21:44,232 --> 01:21:48,669
<i>Me either.</i>

1100
01:21:48,737 --> 01:21:51,001
Wait a minute. No, no, wait.
There it goes again.

1101
01:21:51,072 --> 01:21:53,905
It's a very distinct
thumping sound.

1102
01:21:53,975 --> 01:21:56,375
Kind of like a boom, boom, boom.
Don't you hear it?

1103
01:21:56,444 --> 01:21:59,140
Oh, yeah. We've been
hearing that all night.

1104
01:22:01,583 --> 01:22:03,517
Hey, can I share
something with you?

1105
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:05,576
Yeah.

1106
01:22:05,654 --> 01:22:07,713
I know I just met you guys,
and it's kind of corny...

1107
01:22:07,789 --> 01:22:09,780
but tonight's been
a real eye-opener for me.

1108
01:22:09,858 --> 01:22:12,588
- How's that?
- I just--

1109
01:22:12,694 --> 01:22:15,185
I realized tonight that I love people,
you know?

1110
01:22:15,297 --> 01:22:19,233
I mean, life is great. Yeah? Huh?
Isn't life great?

1111
01:22:19,334 --> 01:22:23,168
- You sound like you're in love.
- Well, as a matter of fact...

1112
01:22:24,873 --> 01:22:27,467
I just met this
really terrific woman.

1113
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:29,476
What's her name?

1114
01:22:29,544 --> 01:22:32,035
- I can really use something like that in my life.
- What's her name?

1115
01:22:32,113 --> 01:22:33,671
- Her name's Sarah. Yeah.
- Sarah?

1116
01:22:33,748 --> 01:22:37,582
<i>- You got a picture?
- Do you have any idea how long it's been...</i>

1117
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:39,950
since I've had a picture
of a woman in my wallet?

1118
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:43,218
- Except my mother, of course.
- You got a picture of your mother in your wallet?

1119
01:22:43,291 --> 01:22:45,225
- Yeah.
- I have the same thing in my wallet.

1120
01:22:45,327 --> 01:22:47,955
Well, then let's compare.

1121
01:22:48,063 --> 01:22:51,590
It's a beautiful thing.

1122
01:22:51,700 --> 01:22:53,827
I really hope we can all
get to be friends.

1123
01:22:53,902 --> 01:22:55,870
There she is.

1124
01:23:08,116 --> 01:23:10,414
What are you doing?

1125
01:23:10,485 --> 01:23:13,249
- I'm gonna kill that son of a bitch!
- What are you doing?

1126
01:23:13,321 --> 01:23:16,620
<i>Stop it! Are you crazy?
Stop it!</i>

1127
01:23:16,691 --> 01:23:18,716
- Put the gun down!
- Get off of me!

1128
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:20,886
- The cops are down the street.
- He's got our money!

1129
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:23,965
<i>- Just get in the car.
- I'll kill him.</i>

1130
01:23:47,555 --> 01:23:50,353
- Hey!
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, Merlin!

1131
01:23:50,425 --> 01:23:52,359
Hold on! Hold on!
Whoa!

1132
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:56,157
What do you call it?
Whoa, Merlin! That-a-boy. Okay.

1133
01:23:56,264 --> 01:23:59,665
<i>- Hey, look who it is!
- Get in, Bill.</i>

1134
01:23:59,734 --> 01:24:02,703
- We gotta have a serious talk! Now
get me the hell outta here! - Uh-oh.

1135
01:24:02,771 --> 01:24:07,037
<i>Serious talk.
Come on. Come on, Merlin.</i>

1136
01:24:12,547 --> 01:24:15,107
<i>What do you call it? Whoa.</i>

1137
01:24:15,183 --> 01:24:19,677
So, I guess we have
a clean slate now. Huh?

1138
01:24:19,754 --> 01:24:22,052
Good boy, Merlin.

1139
01:24:22,123 --> 01:24:25,718
Go home now. Stay off the interstate.

1140
01:24:25,827 --> 01:24:28,523
There you go.

1141
01:24:28,630 --> 01:24:31,121
Not quite.

1142
01:24:43,211 --> 01:24:45,111
Shh!

1143
01:24:45,180 --> 01:24:47,705
Quiet, okay?

1144
01:24:47,782 --> 01:24:52,082
So I get into the car
with these two strangers, and--

1145
01:24:52,153 --> 01:24:56,283
this is very funny--

1146
01:24:56,357 --> 01:25:01,488
I show them a picture of Ma,
and they start shooting at me.

1147
01:25:01,596 --> 01:25:04,064
That's weird.

1148
01:25:04,132 --> 01:25:07,659
- That's weird.
- Do you have any idea why?

1149
01:25:07,735 --> 01:25:12,035
Maybe it was a bad picture.

1150
01:25:12,107 --> 01:25:16,237
Hey! Ow! Ow! Ow!

1151
01:25:16,311 --> 01:25:19,371
Who are they?

1152
01:25:19,447 --> 01:25:21,813
<i>Hey, Bill, I mean,
were they alone?</i>

1153
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:23,817
I said there
were two of them.

1154
01:25:23,885 --> 01:25:26,479
- There was nobody else with them?
- I just said there were two of them.

1155
01:25:26,554 --> 01:25:28,488
They were alone.

1156
01:25:28,556 --> 01:25:30,990
I just said
there were two of them!

1157
01:25:31,059 --> 01:25:33,050
- Oh, good.
- What do you mean, ''Oh, good''?

1158
01:25:33,128 --> 01:25:37,030
I mean--
What do I mean, Dave?

1159
01:25:37,098 --> 01:25:39,089
He-- He--

1160
01:25:39,200 --> 01:25:41,430
He means that...

1161
01:25:41,503 --> 01:25:45,200
if there were more than two,
you could have been hurt.

1162
01:25:45,273 --> 01:25:47,207
Three's bad.
That's right.

1163
01:25:47,275 --> 01:25:49,266
I'm getting this feeling...

1164
01:25:49,344 --> 01:25:51,539
that you're not
telling me something!

1165
01:25:51,613 --> 01:25:54,309
Yeah, well, this feeling
you're getting is paranoia!

1166
01:25:54,382 --> 01:25:57,010
- I don't think so!
- Well, think again!

1167
01:25:57,085 --> 01:25:59,110
Come on.
Let's just go.

1168
01:26:03,191 --> 01:26:05,182
I'm almost certain
this one's it.

1169
01:26:06,694 --> 01:26:09,720
Hey, Bill, a guy in prison told
me if you use the wrong key...

1170
01:26:09,831 --> 01:26:12,823
you could set off
the alarm.

1171
01:26:12,934 --> 01:26:15,630
Why don't you let me
do the crackin'...

1172
01:26:15,703 --> 01:26:17,637
and you do the jackin'?

1173
01:26:17,705 --> 01:26:19,969
Hey, leave him alone, Bill.
Prison's a lonely place.

1174
01:26:20,041 --> 01:26:21,975
- You told.
- Sure, I heard things in the night.

1175
01:26:22,043 --> 01:26:24,568
Shut up!

1176
01:26:24,646 --> 01:26:27,046
<i>Shit! I told ya!</i>

1177
01:26:27,115 --> 01:26:29,549
- Stop the madness!
- All right, all right, all right.

1178
01:26:29,617 --> 01:26:31,778
It said ''Nissan.''
Nissan.

1179
01:26:31,853 --> 01:26:34,413
- Nissan's for a car.
- But it was round...

1180
01:26:34,489 --> 01:26:36,480
- Okay! All right!
- with a curve that goes like an ''S.''

1181
01:26:36,558 --> 01:26:38,549
- Hurry up, Bill!
- Okay! Okay!

1182
01:26:38,626 --> 01:26:40,594
You're kidding me.

1183
01:26:43,831 --> 01:26:45,799
- Agent Peyser?
- What?

1184
01:26:45,867 --> 01:26:48,028
- Agent Peyser?
- What?

1185
01:26:48,102 --> 01:26:51,196
- You're not gonna believe this.
- Oh, come on. Try me.

1186
01:26:51,272 --> 01:26:53,638
We got another alarm
at the bank.

1187
01:26:55,210 --> 01:26:58,805
<i>Yes! Yes!</i>

1188
01:26:58,880 --> 01:27:02,111
No! Shit!

1189
01:27:20,335 --> 01:27:22,860
I know what to do.

1190
01:27:24,939 --> 01:27:28,340
That's the most money
I ever held at once.

1191
01:27:29,344 --> 01:27:32,142
You're right, Bill.

1192
01:27:32,213 --> 01:27:34,272
Never was ours.

1193
01:27:35,583 --> 01:27:39,917
I tell you,
I never felt better in my life.

1194
01:28:05,246 --> 01:28:08,079
Where'd you go for that tire?
Palm Beach?

1195
01:28:08,149 --> 01:28:10,140
Sorry, Ed.

1196
01:28:14,822 --> 01:28:17,950
Holy shit. Get down, Clovis.
Get down.

1197
01:28:18,059 --> 01:28:20,118
Boy, am I good.

1198
01:28:22,030 --> 01:28:25,329
Get inside of theJeep,
or I'll blow your heads off.

1199
01:28:38,813 --> 01:28:42,715
You know, every time there's a problem,
those two idiots show up.

1200
01:28:42,784 --> 01:28:44,718
I'm telling you,
they know something.

1201
01:28:44,786 --> 01:28:47,687
Listen, guys. Where are you taking us?
What is this?

1202
01:28:47,755 --> 01:28:49,780
Up to that
bank president's house.

1203
01:28:49,857 --> 01:28:52,223
''Bank-- '' ''Bank president''?
What are you talking about?

1204
01:28:52,327 --> 01:28:54,261
What do you think,
we're stupid?

1205
01:28:54,329 --> 01:28:57,890
<i>No, I don't think you're stupid, but I know
how to keep you in suspense.</i>

1206
01:28:57,999 --> 01:29:01,491
<i>- How?
- I bet I know how to keep you in suspense.</i>

1207
01:29:01,602 --> 01:29:05,197
- How?
- For Christ's sake, Clovis! They're bullshitting you!

1208
01:29:05,273 --> 01:29:09,573
- We know that's where the money is.
- Money? What money?

1209
01:29:09,644 --> 01:29:13,774
- Yeah, we-- we don't have any money.
- Oh, shut up, will you?

1210
01:29:13,848 --> 01:29:15,782
You don't think we know
what you're doing?

1211
01:29:15,850 --> 01:29:18,444
You and the Andersons probably
cooked this whole thing up together.

1212
01:29:20,655 --> 01:29:23,522
<i>Looks like they got company
with them in thatJeep.</i>

1213
01:29:23,591 --> 01:29:25,525
All units,
this is Agent Peyser.

1214
01:29:25,626 --> 01:29:28,561
We are in pursuit
of a 1994 black Pathfinder.

1215
01:29:28,629 --> 01:29:32,360
<i>- License plateD-U-H--
- That's appropriate.</i>

1216
01:29:32,433 --> 01:29:34,367
Vanity plates.

1217
01:29:34,435 --> 01:29:37,029
D- U-H-1-7-1.

1218
01:29:37,105 --> 01:29:41,633
Location: east on Main Street,
heading toward River Road.

1219
01:29:43,644 --> 01:29:46,807
''So, uh, what kind
of license plate do you have?''

1220
01:29:46,881 --> 01:29:48,872
''Duh.''

1221
01:29:58,659 --> 01:30:00,650
Come on! Move it!

1222
01:30:02,096 --> 01:30:04,064
Come on!

1223
01:30:05,166 --> 01:30:08,329
<i>Let's go, let's go, let's go!
Come on!</i>

1224
01:30:12,273 --> 01:30:14,833
<i>Look at those clowns.</i>

1225
01:30:14,909 --> 01:30:16,843
<i>Why don't wejust take 'em?</i>

1226
01:30:16,911 --> 01:30:19,971
No. Let's wait and see
what they're up to.

1227
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:25,279
Hit the wipers.

1228
01:30:27,488 --> 01:30:29,422
<i>Am I nuts?
I know those plates.</i>

1229
01:30:29,490 --> 01:30:31,981
Where do I know
those plates from?

1230
01:30:33,995 --> 01:30:36,987
Something came over the wire tonight
about two escaped convicts...

1231
01:30:37,098 --> 01:30:39,032
<i>in a Caddy
with New York plates.</i>

1232
01:30:39,100 --> 01:30:41,933
That's right. Get on the horn.
Get everybody down here.

1233
01:30:42,003 --> 01:30:47,373
You're gonna have to kill me, because I'm not
dragging those people in that house into this.

1234
01:30:47,442 --> 01:30:49,535
So why don't you
just pull your trigger?

1235
01:30:49,610 --> 01:30:53,273
There's no money, all right?
So just get it out of your head.

1236
01:30:57,018 --> 01:30:58,952
They're here.

1237
01:30:59,020 --> 01:31:00,885
Yep. They're here.

1238
01:31:00,955 --> 01:31:03,355
Let's take them down.

1239
01:31:04,992 --> 01:31:07,756
Come on, pecker head!
Move!

1240
01:31:07,862 --> 01:31:10,296
<i>Clovis, watch these three clowns
while I check out the house.</i>

1241
01:31:10,364 --> 01:31:13,026
Okay, Ed.

1242
01:31:17,572 --> 01:31:21,064
Season's greetings.
Santa Claus is coming to town.

1243
01:31:22,743 --> 01:31:24,643
Shut up and get inside.

1244
01:31:24,712 --> 01:31:27,909
<i>Well, well, well. Doesn't that figure?
Get out of my face.</i>

1245
01:31:27,982 --> 01:31:30,314
- Shut up and get in.
- Ma! What--

1246
01:31:30,384 --> 01:31:33,148
What-- What are you
doing here?

1247
01:31:33,221 --> 01:31:37,658
I'm being held hostage on the night babyJesus
was born. What the hell does it look like?

1248
01:31:37,725 --> 01:31:40,558
Get over there.

1249
01:31:40,661 --> 01:31:43,596
- Please don't tell me you knew about this.
- Uh, no. No, l--

1250
01:31:46,000 --> 01:31:47,934
I'm sorry.
I know it's bad.

1251
01:31:48,002 --> 01:31:51,369
- Whoa.

1252
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:55,500
- I'm sorry, Ma.

1253
01:31:55,576 --> 01:31:58,101
I'm sorry, everybody.

1254
01:31:58,179 --> 01:32:01,012
<i>- I swear I'm gonna get us all out of this.
- Oh, no. Come on.</i>

1255
01:32:01,082 --> 01:32:04,415
It wasn't your fault. It was my fault,
Ma. l-- I convinced Bill...

1256
01:32:04,485 --> 01:32:07,682
that he was a wanted man in New York
and he had to come down here.

1257
01:32:07,755 --> 01:32:10,656
No choice. But he resisted,
every step of the way.

1258
01:32:10,725 --> 01:32:13,659
- Sarah, he didn't know about your father.
- Yeah, sure.

1259
01:32:13,694 --> 01:32:16,595
No. He really thought he was dying,
and he came down here to help you.

1260
01:32:16,664 --> 01:32:20,998
- What are you talking about?
- Just give us the money, and we're out of here.

1261
01:32:21,068 --> 01:32:24,469
You're in for a rude awakening,
because there's no money! Okay?

1262
01:32:24,539 --> 01:32:27,997
- No! No!
- V-V-Vic, listen to me.

1263
01:32:28,075 --> 01:32:31,602
There's no money. He's not lying.
I swear on my mother's grave.

1264
01:32:31,679 --> 01:32:35,445
Don't say that with this lunatic
pointing a gun at my head.

1265
01:32:35,516 --> 01:32:37,484
Are you telling me
you didn't rob the bank?

1266
01:32:39,987 --> 01:32:41,978
Is it true?

1267
01:32:43,958 --> 01:32:48,395
Yeah. We did it, Mr. Anderson,
and we're sorry.

1268
01:32:48,496 --> 01:32:51,761
But I swear we're not the same people
we were this morning. I swear it.

1269
01:32:51,832 --> 01:32:56,428
- Oh, where's my violin?
- Vic, you gotta believe us.

1270
01:32:56,504 --> 01:32:58,472
<i>These people,
they're good people.</i>

1271
01:32:58,539 --> 01:33:02,771
<i>They took us in, and they treated us
like we was one of their own.</i>

1272
01:33:02,843 --> 01:33:06,779
- And all we could do in return
was steal from them.

1273
01:33:10,217 --> 01:33:13,778
Vic, these people had nothing to do
with this. You gotta let 'em go!

1274
01:33:13,888 --> 01:33:15,856
<i>We can solve this
between us.</i>

1275
01:33:15,923 --> 01:33:18,414
I'll let 'em go
as soon as I get my money.

1276
01:33:18,526 --> 01:33:20,585
Vic, we put
the money back.

1277
01:33:20,695 --> 01:33:23,289
<i>Put it back? Back in the bank?</i>

1278
01:33:23,364 --> 01:33:24,854
No.

1279
01:33:26,934 --> 01:33:28,868
We gave the money
to the church.

1280
01:33:28,936 --> 01:33:32,337
<i>You expect me to believe that
horse shit? Who wants to die first?</i>

1281
01:33:32,406 --> 01:33:35,102
Pop, will you knock it off?

1282
01:33:44,118 --> 01:33:48,111
<i>Who gets shot first?
Suspenders.</i>

1283
01:33:48,222 --> 01:33:50,190
<i>Then maybe you.</i>

1284
01:33:53,394 --> 01:33:57,023
Get down. Get down.
Way down, boys. Get down.

1285
01:33:58,399 --> 01:34:00,390
<i>- Yes, sir.
- What's going on here?</i>

1286
01:34:00,468 --> 01:34:03,528
I've got bad news.
We got a hostage situation.

1287
01:34:03,604 --> 01:34:06,095
And your son's inside.

1288
01:34:06,173 --> 01:34:08,733
Move! Move up!

1289
01:34:11,212 --> 01:34:14,511
This is the F.B.I.
You're completely surrounded.

1290
01:34:14,582 --> 01:34:17,676
<i>Lay down your weapons. Come out with
your hands above your head.</i>

1291
01:34:17,752 --> 01:34:20,846
Sit down! Sit down, or I'm gonna
shoot somebody! Sit down!

1292
01:34:20,955 --> 01:34:23,389
I can't go back to prison.
I learned my lesson already.

1293
01:34:23,457 --> 01:34:25,482
Look what you started,
you big gorilla.

1294
01:34:25,593 --> 01:34:27,527
Look what I started? I don't know
what you're talking about.

1295
01:34:27,595 --> 01:34:31,031
Your idiot sons. If it wasn't for them, we'd
be in prison without a care in the world.

1296
01:34:31,132 --> 01:34:35,091
If it wasn't for your goddamn,
long-winded, piece-of-shit letter...

1297
01:34:35,169 --> 01:34:38,104
<i>whining about how your daughter
doesn't come visit you no more...</i>

1298
01:34:38,172 --> 01:34:40,231
I never would've sent my boys
down here in the first place.

1299
01:34:40,307 --> 01:34:43,140
I never wrote any letter.

1300
01:34:48,349 --> 01:34:50,340
Ma.

1301
01:34:52,553 --> 01:34:54,521
Who wrote what to whom?

1302
01:34:54,588 --> 01:34:56,556
It's a moot point at this juncture.
Don't you think?

1303
01:34:56,624 --> 01:35:00,219
<i>Especially given the gravity
of the situation...</i>

1304
01:35:00,327 --> 01:35:02,625
outside.

1305
01:35:02,697 --> 01:35:05,359
It just never ends with you.

1306
01:35:08,035 --> 01:35:10,560
No.

1307
01:35:10,638 --> 01:35:13,402
Liar, liar, pants on fire.

1308
01:35:13,474 --> 01:35:17,911
Nose is as long
as a telephone wire.

1309
01:35:17,978 --> 01:35:22,711
<i>- Come on, Caesar. We're getting out of here.
- Don't make me shoot you.</i>

1310
01:35:22,783 --> 01:35:25,377
- You shut up.
- Liar, liar.

1311
01:35:25,453 --> 01:35:27,444
What starts in fun
ends in tears.

1312
01:35:27,555 --> 01:35:30,718
- Liar!
- Caesar, I said let's get out of here.

1313
01:35:32,927 --> 01:35:35,361
You son of a bitch!

1314
01:35:39,767 --> 01:35:42,099
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

1315
01:35:49,944 --> 01:35:53,539
- Stay on the floor!
- Why don't you put some guns on me?

1316
01:35:57,418 --> 01:35:59,682
<i>Timmy!</i>

1317
01:36:02,223 --> 01:36:05,659
- I got the guy. I'm the one who got the guy.
- We've got it all under control!

1318
01:36:05,726 --> 01:36:10,595
- We've got it all under control!
- This is a big mistake. I can explain everything.

1319
01:36:10,664 --> 01:36:12,825
Clovis, what the hell
did you do now?

1320
01:36:12,900 --> 01:36:15,368
<i>- Over here!
- Move! Move!</i>

1321
01:36:15,436 --> 01:36:18,303
Come on, come on.

1322
01:36:18,372 --> 01:36:21,170
<i>Come on!
Get everybody out!</i>

1323
01:36:24,044 --> 01:36:26,877
We didn't do that,
did we?

1324
01:36:33,020 --> 01:36:35,545
Come on. Let's go.

1325
01:36:35,656 --> 01:36:38,147
Get him out.

1326
01:36:38,259 --> 01:36:41,228
Line them
right up behind me.

1327
01:36:41,295 --> 01:36:43,661
Come on. Keep moving.
Keep moving.

1328
01:36:43,731 --> 01:36:47,030
Come on, guys. Let's go.
Keep it moving.

1329
01:36:47,101 --> 01:36:50,070
Come on, buddy.

1330
01:36:50,137 --> 01:36:53,402
Send those escaped cons back to New York
before they ruin my Christmas.

1331
01:36:54,708 --> 01:36:56,642
<i>All the way in. Let's go.</i>

1332
01:36:56,710 --> 01:36:58,735
Watch the shirt.
It was a present.

1333
01:36:58,813 --> 01:37:02,476
I'm a deputy, for Christ's sake! I demand
to know what the hell's going on here!

1334
01:37:02,550 --> 01:37:04,950
- Get some chairs out here.
- I didn't take Merlin.

1335
01:37:05,019 --> 01:37:07,146
Pull out some of those chairs.
See how many we can get.

1336
01:37:07,254 --> 01:37:09,484
Pull out some of those chairs.
That'll be fine.

1337
01:37:21,468 --> 01:37:23,459
All right, all right, all right.

1338
01:37:24,705 --> 01:37:27,606
Shut up!

1339
01:37:27,675 --> 01:37:31,042
Shut-- Quiet, please.

1340
01:37:31,111 --> 01:37:33,705
Thank you.

1341
01:37:36,150 --> 01:37:38,118
Father Gorenzel,
can we talk?

1342
01:37:38,185 --> 01:37:41,086
Of course, Sarah.
I'm always available to talk.

1343
01:37:41,188 --> 01:37:43,156
Come in. Come in.

1344
01:37:47,061 --> 01:37:50,030
You won't believe
what happened.

1345
01:37:50,097 --> 01:37:53,794
I just got back from church. There was
a knock on the door, and this...

1346
01:37:53,868 --> 01:37:55,802
<i>was lying outside.</i>

1347
01:37:55,870 --> 01:37:58,168
This note was with it.

1348
01:38:00,808 --> 01:38:05,211
''Please take this money.
It belongs to the people of Paradise.

1349
01:38:06,213 --> 01:38:08,204
The Three Wise Men.''

1350
01:38:47,788 --> 01:38:50,689
What did he say?

1351
01:38:50,758 --> 01:38:53,386
He said
it's time to forgive.

1352
01:38:56,230 --> 01:39:00,633
I'm sorry, Cliff, that I didn't
tell you everything about myself.

1353
01:39:00,701 --> 01:39:03,693
It wouldn't have mattered
if you had.

1354
01:39:06,373 --> 01:39:08,739
<i>Uh, Mrs. Anderson...</i>

1355
01:39:08,809 --> 01:39:12,404
you were probably closest to the
perpetrators at the time of the robbery.

1356
01:39:12,479 --> 01:39:14,947
- Yeah, that's right.
- Okay.

1357
01:39:15,015 --> 01:39:19,577
Now, can you identify these three men
as the men who robbed the bank?

1358
01:39:33,734 --> 01:39:35,725
No, I don't believe so.

1359
01:39:39,006 --> 01:39:41,406
How can you be so sure?

1360
01:39:42,743 --> 01:39:46,873
Well, to begin with,
the robbers were wearing masks.

1361
01:39:48,315 --> 01:39:50,249
- Deputy Timmy?
- Sir.

1362
01:39:50,317 --> 01:39:52,148
<i>You were in the house
at the time.</i>

1363
01:39:52,219 --> 01:39:56,451
Why don't you tell the people
what the hell was going on?

1364
01:39:58,692 --> 01:40:02,253
They saved us from being hurt.
That's what happened.

1365
01:40:02,329 --> 01:40:05,093
What a crock
of stinking horse shit.

1366
01:40:05,165 --> 01:40:08,794
What do you know?
You slept through the whole thing.

1367
01:40:08,869 --> 01:40:13,135
I wanna know how exactly
you two seem to fit into all this.

1368
01:40:13,207 --> 01:40:16,870
We're deputies, for Christ's sake.
Right, Bernie?

1369
01:40:16,944 --> 01:40:19,378
We were trying to make an arrest.

1370
01:40:19,446 --> 01:40:24,440
These three were in my store a half hour before
the robbery, and they bought three ski masks.

1371
01:40:24,518 --> 01:40:27,919
Whoa. Wait a minute.
You withheld this information? Huh?

1372
01:40:28,022 --> 01:40:30,354
Oh,Jesus, uh--

1373
01:40:30,424 --> 01:40:34,554
Spill on aisle three.
Spill on aisle three.

1374
01:40:34,628 --> 01:40:36,596
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Spill on aisle three!

1375
01:40:36,663 --> 01:40:41,123
Spill on aisle three! Spill on aisle three!
Spill on aisle three!

1376
01:40:41,201 --> 01:40:43,829
- And then everyone was hustling sandals--
- Sit down! Sit down!

1377
01:40:43,904 --> 01:40:47,533
- And I didn't-- What?
- Sit down.

1378
01:40:47,608 --> 01:40:51,271
This was something I didn't quite
put together till just now.

1379
01:40:51,345 --> 01:40:54,109
If these three guys aren't the crooks,
I'd like to know--

1380
01:40:54,181 --> 01:40:56,115
- Sit down.
- Then where the hell...

1381
01:40:56,183 --> 01:40:58,777
are the three ski masks
they bought from my store?

1382
01:41:02,556 --> 01:41:05,354
You wanna see
three ski masks?

1383
01:41:05,426 --> 01:41:08,589
- Yeah.
- Is that it?

1384
01:41:09,863 --> 01:41:12,923
I'll show you three ski masks.
Right in there.

1385
01:41:15,469 --> 01:41:19,599
Guess what?
There's one, two.

1386
01:41:19,673 --> 01:41:22,267
Can we make it three?
Three ski--

1387
01:41:22,342 --> 01:41:24,742
- Sit down, you clown.
- Okay.

1388
01:41:30,851 --> 01:41:33,183
Everything I got
points to you three.

1389
01:41:34,955 --> 01:41:37,788
<i>And don't give me
that ''Who, me?''look.</i>

1390
01:41:37,858 --> 01:41:40,190
I can't believe the only thing
I got you on is some parole violation.

1391
01:41:40,260 --> 01:41:43,991
You didn't rob the bank? I wanna know exactly
where you were at the time of the robbery.

1392
01:41:47,367 --> 01:41:49,858
<i>They were with me
Christmas shopping.</i>

1393
01:41:49,937 --> 01:41:53,498
- What?
- It's true, Agent Peyser.

1394
01:41:53,574 --> 01:41:56,099
<i>I saw them all go together.</i>

1395
01:41:56,176 --> 01:41:59,168
<i>Now I remember. I saw them too.</i>

1396
01:42:01,748 --> 01:42:05,809
All right, all right.
Shut up! Shut up!

1397
01:42:05,886 --> 01:42:08,878
E- E-Ed, swallow that.

1398
01:42:14,061 --> 01:42:16,757
Christmas shopping.

1399
01:42:16,830 --> 01:42:19,993
Something tells me
I'm really getting jammed.

1400
01:42:24,671 --> 01:42:26,764
Let me guess.

1401
01:42:26,840 --> 01:42:29,707
- It's the money from the robbery.
- Money.

1402
01:42:29,776 --> 01:42:33,974
Some-- Somebody...
dropped it outside... my front door.

1403
01:42:36,116 --> 01:42:38,380
<i>And you have no idea
who it might have been?</i>

1404
01:42:38,452 --> 01:42:40,750
<i>I don't know.
l- I was praying.</i>

1405
01:42:40,854 --> 01:42:44,051
Oh, well, you're a priest.
Yeah.

1406
01:42:44,158 --> 01:42:46,422
We'll talk later.

1407
01:42:52,166 --> 01:42:54,760
What the hell's
going on in this town? Huh?

1408
01:42:54,835 --> 01:42:58,362
What-What-What-
What-What-What--

1409
01:43:13,954 --> 01:43:15,888
Come here.

1410
01:43:15,956 --> 01:43:17,924
Come here.

1411
01:43:26,266 --> 01:43:29,565
I don't know what the hell
happened in this town...

1412
01:43:31,004 --> 01:43:35,100
and it's obvious nobody here
is gonna tell me.

1413
01:43:35,175 --> 01:43:39,669
But I suspect that you three are
getting the break of a lifetime.

1414
01:43:39,746 --> 01:43:43,409
Don't screw it up.
You understand?

1415
01:43:43,483 --> 01:43:46,353
'Cause it's not gonna
come around again.

1416
01:43:46,388 --> 01:43:48,218
We won't, sir.

1417
01:43:54,528 --> 01:43:58,828
Get out of here.

1418
01:44:06,206 --> 01:44:09,141
<i>Ma.</i>

1419
01:44:15,649 --> 01:44:17,583
Give me that.
You're gonna lose it.

1420
01:44:19,853 --> 01:44:24,085
Well, I know
it sounds dumb, but...

1421
01:44:25,726 --> 01:44:28,160
I'm really proud
of you three.

1422
01:44:30,397 --> 01:44:32,422
Thanks, Ma.

1423
01:44:32,499 --> 01:44:35,059
And you're through with
all this nonsense, right?

1424
01:44:35,135 --> 01:44:37,501
- Oh, absolutely.
- Yeah.

1425
01:44:37,571 --> 01:44:39,505
You got it, Ma.

1426
01:44:43,944 --> 01:44:45,844
Hey, what?

1427
01:44:50,517 --> 01:44:53,384
- I paid for that.
- Mine.

1428
01:44:53,453 --> 01:44:56,149
- I paid for that.
- I didn't see nothing.

1429
01:44:56,223 --> 01:44:58,157
- Tell her. I paid for it.
- No.

1430
01:44:58,225 --> 01:45:00,216
<i>- You saw me buy it.
- I saw nothing.</i>

1431
01:45:00,294 --> 01:45:03,457
<i>- Tell it, Dave!
- I'm a blind man.</i>

1432
01:45:03,530 --> 01:45:06,693
<i>- l-- l-- You're not--
- Who's lying now?</i>

1433
01:45:17,611 --> 01:45:20,478
- I guess I just want to say good-bye.
- I'm glad.

1434
01:45:20,547 --> 01:45:23,414
Did things work out
between you and your dad?

1435
01:45:23,483 --> 01:45:28,386
Well, I guess I got
nothing to hide now, so--

1436
01:45:28,455 --> 01:45:32,516
I don't know.
Maybe there's hope for him.

1437
01:45:32,592 --> 01:45:35,322
Good.

1438
01:45:38,098 --> 01:45:41,659
- It's my bus. I guess I better get going, right?
- Yeah.

1439
01:45:45,005 --> 01:45:48,532
Listen. How would you feel if I were
to settle down in a place like this?

1440
01:45:48,642 --> 01:45:51,543
A place like this?
Or this place?

1441
01:45:51,611 --> 01:45:54,876
Maybe I could manage some
little restaurant down here.

1442
01:45:54,948 --> 01:45:57,576
Get you half off on lunch,
free coffee with every meal.

1443
01:45:57,651 --> 01:46:02,054
I'll see you every morning in the bank
when I'm making my deposits.

1444
01:46:02,122 --> 01:46:05,489
- Stay out of the bank, all right?
- Give me a chance.

1445
01:46:10,497 --> 01:46:14,092
- Bill--
- Maybe we could hit it off.

1446
01:46:14,167 --> 01:46:16,101
Look.

1447

He's really going for it.

1448
01:46:57,411 --> 01:47:00,642
- Hey, man, get a room.
- What for?

1449

Hey, Ma, what are you
so happy about?

1451
01:47:06,753 --> 01:47:09,688
Well, your brother's
got himself a girlfriend.

1452
01:47:09,756 --> 01:47:11,690

1453
01:47:11,758 --> 01:47:13,692

1454
01:47:13,760 --> 01:47:16,058

1455
01:47:16,129 --> 01:47:20,225
Speaking of which,
when are you two gonna get hitched?

1456
01:47:20,300 --> 01:47:23,463
- ''Get hitched.''
- We're not even attracted to each other.

1457
01:47:29,976 --> 01:47:31,876
Hey.

1458
01:47:31,945 --> 01:47:34,607
