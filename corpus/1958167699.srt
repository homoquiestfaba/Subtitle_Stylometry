1
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,886
- Oliver!
- Yeah.

2
00:02:31,919 --> 00:02:33,755
Can you get me
the big cutters?

3
00:02:33,788 --> 00:02:35,355
- You got it.
- Thanks.

4
00:03:36,617 --> 00:03:38,485
Accessing
underground structure.

5
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:40,855
- Feeds are live.
- Got it.

6
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,456
We're in.

7
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:43,991
Wait until the asset
gives the all clear.

8
00:03:44,025 --> 00:03:45,560
Copy.

9
00:03:45,593 --> 00:03:47,729
- Take some pictures.
- Roger.

10
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:50,297
Getting imagery now.

11
00:03:50,330 --> 00:03:51,866
And of the nuclear facility.

12
00:03:51,899 --> 00:03:54,334
Look at that, they
got the whole thing underground.

13
00:03:54,367 --> 00:03:55,937
Even the chimneys are hidden.

14
00:04:09,050 --> 00:04:11,384
Come on Oliver,
let's wrap it up.

15
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:16,256
Hey!

16
00:04:17,324 --> 00:04:19,694
Hey, I'm talking to you.

17
00:04:21,796 --> 00:04:22,797
Hey, hey!

18
00:04:33,373 --> 00:04:35,610
You've seen our paperwork.

19
00:04:35,643 --> 00:04:38,079
Which is working on
the telephone lines...

20
00:04:46,921 --> 00:04:49,422
No, no, no!

21
00:04:49,456 --> 00:04:51,626
He's just quiet,
he doesn't talk much.

22
00:05:03,037 --> 00:05:04,639
By the Ayatollah.

23
00:05:05,773 --> 00:05:06,741
Hey, hey!

24
00:05:09,610 --> 00:05:11,846
Scan all frequencies.

25
00:05:11,879 --> 00:05:13,446
Any charter back to Tehran?

26
00:05:13,480 --> 00:05:15,448
Negative,
no radio transmissions.

27
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:18,686
It's okay.

28
00:05:18,719 --> 00:05:19,854
Just my phone.

29
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:24,324
Look.

30
00:05:26,493 --> 00:05:27,494
See?

31
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:30,998
Come here.

32
00:05:36,469 --> 00:05:38,438
Look, see? Come here.

33
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,373
Now you got fast internet.

34
00:05:41,776 --> 00:05:42,777
Ey?

35
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:46,647
Still want to call Quds Force?

36
00:05:49,016 --> 00:05:51,451
Come here. Come here.

37
00:05:52,419 --> 00:05:53,988
Come here, watch.

38
00:05:54,021 --> 00:05:55,355
Football.

39
00:05:58,826 --> 00:05:59,961
See?

40
00:05:59,994 --> 00:06:01,662
It's a goal!

41
00:06:02,964 --> 00:06:04,599
Yeah.

42
00:06:04,632 --> 00:06:06,868
It's a goal!
Incredible...

43
00:06:21,849 --> 00:06:23,150
They just pulled
away from the sight.

44
00:06:23,184 --> 00:06:24,652
Keep eyes
in the sky on them.

45
00:06:31,959 --> 00:06:34,161
You think they're onto us?

46
00:06:34,195 --> 00:06:36,396
We're not hanging
from a crane yet.

47
00:06:39,200 --> 00:06:41,702
Don't worry, our cover's tight,
we're good.

48
00:06:41,736 --> 00:06:43,604
I'm ready for
this one to be over.

49
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:48,643
Watching right up.

50
00:06:48,676 --> 00:06:50,912
UAVs and
drones on standby.

51
00:06:50,945 --> 00:06:51,946
Maneuver's a go.

52
00:06:51,979 --> 00:06:52,947
Execute.

53
00:06:54,548 --> 00:06:56,517
Breaching firewall.

54
00:06:56,550 --> 00:06:58,819
System running at 95%.

55
00:06:58,853 --> 00:07:01,555
Confirm the alarms
are disabled in centrifuge room.

56
00:07:01,589 --> 00:07:03,557
Confirming,
alarms disabled.

57
00:07:06,227 --> 00:07:08,062
Eyes on guard,
still no movement.

58
00:07:08,095 --> 00:07:10,531
The Trojan horse is
active, and we are undetected.

59
00:07:10,564 --> 00:07:12,033
Copy, no detection.

60
00:07:12,066 --> 00:07:13,167
We're in the mainframe now.

61
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,069
How much time?

62
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:18,205
Ten hours until it
hits the centrifuges.

63
00:07:18,239 --> 00:07:19,607
Twelve until meltdown.

64
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,876
Continue
monitoring the CCTV.

65
00:07:21,909 --> 00:07:22,977
Copy.

66
00:07:23,010 --> 00:07:25,613
Three, two, one.

67
00:07:25,646 --> 00:07:28,049
I'm Luna Kujai, and this
is your Middle East update

68
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:29,617
broadcasting live from Oman.

69
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,953
Tensions continue
after Iran's decision

70
00:07:31,986 --> 00:07:35,488
to abandon nuclear negotiations
with Western powers.

71
00:07:35,523 --> 00:07:38,059
Still no boots on the
ground, as promised by the US.

72
00:07:39,260 --> 00:07:41,862
Three, two, one.

73
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:44,265
Still no boots on the ground,
as promised by the US

74
00:07:44,298 --> 00:07:46,499
and its allies,
after their withdrawal

75
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:48,903
of conventional
forces in Afghanistan.

76
00:07:48,936 --> 00:07:51,105
Yet the shadow war wages on.

77
00:07:51,138 --> 00:07:54,175
Elite American and British
units continue to hunt down

78
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,877
high value targets
in denied territories.

79
00:07:56,911 --> 00:08:00,514
In the last month alone, the
assassinations of two Iranian

80
00:08:00,548 --> 00:08:03,150
nuclear scientists
and a top Al-Qaeda leader...

81
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:22,937
James, James, what do I do now?

82
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:24,772
Okay,
I'm sending the file.

83
00:08:24,805 --> 00:08:26,607
Open the key to
encrypt the connection

84
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:27,975
point to point, we gotta hurry.

85
00:08:38,052 --> 00:08:39,553
Oh, my God!

86
00:08:40,788 --> 00:08:43,157
This exposes
their entire operations.

87
00:08:43,190 --> 00:08:45,026
And that's
why we got to be careful okay.

88
00:08:45,059 --> 00:08:47,828
But no names, you hear me?
Okay? Protect the assets.

89
00:08:47,862 --> 00:08:50,164
Yes, I promise, I promise,
just, just the companies,

90
00:08:50,197 --> 00:08:51,932
the CIA is using for cover,
right?

91
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:53,934
I just want
them to know I'm a patriot

92
00:08:53,968 --> 00:08:55,069
that I'm protecting my country,
that's why I'm doing this.

93
00:08:55,102 --> 00:08:56,670
Yeah.

94
00:08:56,704 --> 00:08:57,972
Wait, someone's coming, I
gotta go.

95
00:08:58,005 --> 00:08:58,939
James?

96
00:09:03,978 --> 00:09:06,147
Der Herald Newspaper,
how may I assist your call?

97
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:07,948
Hi, this is Luna Kujai.

98
00:09:07,982 --> 00:09:10,317
Please connect me
to Hans Forzburg's office.

99
00:09:10,351 --> 00:09:11,952
Uh, yeah, yeah, tell
him it's an emergency.

100
00:09:13,654 --> 00:09:16,590
- Luna, what have you got?
- Hello, Hans?

101
00:09:16,624 --> 00:09:18,192
My Pentagon source
just came through.

102
00:09:18,225 --> 00:09:19,360
Can we
verify the information?

103
00:09:19,393 --> 00:09:22,296
Yeah. The CIA's Black Ops.

104
00:09:22,329 --> 00:09:23,631
Jesus, are you sure?

105
00:09:23,664 --> 00:09:25,132
Yeah, trust me.

106
00:09:25,166 --> 00:09:28,169
It'll be bigger than Snowden
and WikiLeaks combined.

107
00:09:28,202 --> 00:09:29,603
Fantastic work, Luna.

108
00:09:29,637 --> 00:09:30,938
You're exposing the Hypocrisy

109
00:09:30,971 --> 00:09:32,840
and we're going
front page with it.

110
00:10:51,919 --> 00:10:54,221
I'll call Langley,
make sure we're on.

111
00:10:54,255 --> 00:10:55,689
We better be.

112
00:10:55,723 --> 00:10:56,891
Some maintenance guy checks

113
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:59,026
that junction box, we're fucked.

114
00:11:39,466 --> 00:11:41,335
- Hello?
- Hey, it's me.

115
00:11:41,368 --> 00:11:44,271
Huh, every time you call,
it's from a different number.

116
00:11:44,305 --> 00:11:47,875
Listen, I get in late
tomorrow night to Gatwick.

117
00:11:47,908 --> 00:11:50,211
I'll call you if my flight's
delayed, alright?

118
00:11:50,244 --> 00:11:52,780
And make sure you're
on the plane this time, Tom.

119
00:11:52,813 --> 00:11:54,148
'Cause Ida's already
told her friends that her

120
00:11:54,181 --> 00:11:56,150
fucking dad will be there
for her graduation.

121
00:11:56,183 --> 00:11:58,085
Alright, don't start, Cory.

122
00:11:58,118 --> 00:12:00,955
I mean you know,
the job dictates everything.

123
00:12:00,988 --> 00:12:03,324
Well, you know what, you
need to dictate it this time

124
00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:05,025
or you're gonna break her heart.

125
00:12:06,860 --> 00:12:09,964
And... I-- I also need
you to sign the papers.

126
00:12:11,398 --> 00:12:13,400
And, I suppose I could
finally move on.

127
00:12:16,837 --> 00:12:18,839
Are you seeing somebody?

128
00:12:18,872 --> 00:12:20,107
Yeah, I am.

129
00:12:20,140 --> 00:12:23,143
Is this serious?

130
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:25,813
I just want to stop
living in this purgatory.

131
00:12:25,846 --> 00:12:28,249
You know what I mean,
look at your things.

132
00:12:28,282 --> 00:12:30,117
They're all over the flat.

133
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:32,086
I'll do whatever
you need, alright?

134
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:34,121
I just...

135
00:12:34,154 --> 00:12:36,257
I want you to be happy.

136
00:12:36,290 --> 00:12:38,993
Sure you're gonna go right
back there after the graduation.

137
00:12:39,026 --> 00:12:41,862
- You'll never quit.
- I--

138
00:12:41,895 --> 00:12:43,964
- Admit it.
- What do you want from me?

139
00:12:43,998 --> 00:12:47,034
I mean, I don't have anything
else on my resume, do I?

140
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:48,570
You know you can teach.

141
00:12:48,603 --> 00:12:50,871
- Teach?
- Yeah, teach.

142
00:12:50,904 --> 00:12:52,906
Y-- you've got the degree.

143
00:12:52,940 --> 00:12:54,908
I'm not really that interested

144
00:12:54,942 --> 00:12:56,877
in sitting behind
a desk all day.

145
00:13:03,951 --> 00:13:06,086
- I'm sorry, Cory.
- Okay.

146
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:08,822
- About everything.
- Just...

147
00:13:08,856 --> 00:13:10,391
Just please
be safe, will you?

148
00:13:12,527 --> 00:13:15,129
And please be on that flight.

149
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:16,063
Okay.

150
00:15:12,179 --> 00:15:13,180
Yeah.

151
00:15:17,217 --> 00:15:18,520
Hello?

152
00:15:18,553 --> 00:15:20,287
It is good to hear your voice.

153
00:15:21,756 --> 00:15:23,625
Any problems
getting in the country?

154
00:15:23,658 --> 00:15:26,561
No, they bought the cover story.

155
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:29,496
And my fingerprints weren't
in the system, like you said.

156
00:15:29,531 --> 00:15:31,064
You know I got you back.

157
00:15:31,098 --> 00:15:33,066
But still,
you got to be careful.

158
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:35,035
If they find out
who you really are...

159
00:15:35,068 --> 00:15:37,204
I know the risk, Roman.

160
00:15:37,237 --> 00:15:38,673
Trust me.

161
00:15:38,706 --> 00:15:41,041
But I said I will
do this job, and I will.

162
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:43,043
I know you would.

163
00:15:43,076 --> 00:15:45,279
That's why I got
that info you wanted.

164
00:15:46,246 --> 00:15:48,081
Nahal Hosseini.

165
00:15:48,115 --> 00:15:49,517
I'll text you her number.

166
00:15:49,551 --> 00:15:51,452
Thank you, thanks.

167
00:15:51,485 --> 00:15:53,420
When does
your friends come here?

168
00:15:53,454 --> 00:15:55,690
Day after tomorrow.

169
00:15:55,723 --> 00:15:59,059
Roman, it's just
a translating job, right?

170
00:15:59,092 --> 00:16:00,662
Just translating, yes.

171
00:16:02,029 --> 00:16:04,064
Okay, I got to go.

172
00:16:42,804 --> 00:16:44,438
Status?

173
00:16:44,471 --> 00:16:46,774
Centrifuges
are at temperature, sir.

174
00:16:46,808 --> 00:16:48,543
Distributing
variable spin speed.

175
00:16:48,576 --> 00:16:49,711
It's moving up now.

176
00:16:49,744 --> 00:16:51,679
Increasing to 70,000 rpm.

177
00:16:51,713 --> 00:16:53,781
- Do they know we're in?
- No, sir.

178
00:16:53,815 --> 00:16:55,349
We're still clean.

179
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:56,651
Do it.

180
00:16:56,684 --> 00:16:58,151
Is everyone
at their stations?

181
00:16:58,185 --> 00:17:00,320
Increasing
speeds to 90,000 rpm.

182
00:17:02,690 --> 00:17:04,792
Tracking pressure
increase in reactive space.

183
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:09,531
Temperature
continuing to rise.

184
00:17:09,564 --> 00:17:11,198
Now at 800 degrees.

185
00:17:12,634 --> 00:17:14,802
They manually triggered
their emergency alarms.

186
00:17:18,305 --> 00:17:20,374
They triggered
the halon gas system.

187
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,423
Alright, I'm off to the airport.

188
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:51,526
- Anything from Roman?
- All clean.

189
00:19:51,559 --> 00:19:54,394
Alright, make
sure... clean out the house.

190
00:19:54,428 --> 00:19:56,698
Wipe down all
the hard drives, ey?

191
00:19:56,731 --> 00:19:58,465
- Full burn down.
- You got it.

192
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:02,469
Say hello to the
free world for me.

193
00:20:04,005 --> 00:20:05,439
Take care.

194
00:20:35,368 --> 00:20:38,606
How the fuck can you be
running out of ammunition?

195
00:20:38,639 --> 00:20:40,541
When the Americans
left you with it?

196
00:20:40,575 --> 00:20:44,478
That was a long time ago, Kahil,
we're also fighting Daesh.

197
00:20:44,512 --> 00:20:47,749
New ISISK fighters coming in
from the Gulf every single day.

198
00:21:00,027 --> 00:21:01,896
Mullah Omar is dead.

199
00:21:01,929 --> 00:21:03,965
Done gone, now what?

200
00:21:03,998 --> 00:21:06,534
I know they don't understand
a word I'm saying right now.

201
00:21:07,602 --> 00:21:09,469
But you better.

202
00:21:09,504 --> 00:21:11,739
Can't have you pull
this crazy shit all over again.

203
00:21:14,776 --> 00:21:16,476
Chopping heads off.

204
00:21:17,945 --> 00:21:20,047
Beating women in public.

205
00:21:20,081 --> 00:21:22,449
Taking selfies.

206
00:21:22,482 --> 00:21:24,085
The world is watching.

207
00:21:24,118 --> 00:21:27,021
And you have to show
them that you are modernizing.

208
00:21:27,054 --> 00:21:30,625
Because I can't have
my leaders face sanctions.

209
00:21:30,658 --> 00:21:33,795
But what you're worried
about is the dangers

210
00:21:33,828 --> 00:21:35,663
of little girls going to school.

211
00:21:35,696 --> 00:21:38,099
I'm not worried about
little girls in schools.

212
00:21:38,132 --> 00:21:39,100
Then what're you worried about?

213
00:21:39,133 --> 00:21:42,036
Traitors, Kahil, traitors.

214
00:21:42,069 --> 00:21:44,605
You continue
this revenge shit.

215
00:21:45,907 --> 00:21:48,408
There will be no
sanctuary for you

216
00:21:48,441 --> 00:21:51,478
or anyone of
you anywhere in Pakistan.

217
00:21:51,512 --> 00:21:53,681
Because the
Americans will come again.

218
00:21:53,714 --> 00:21:57,552
And they will bomb
the fuck out of you, again.

219
00:21:57,585 --> 00:21:59,053
So you'll be running
around in circles.

220
00:22:34,655 --> 00:22:37,457
Remember who put
you in that chair, Rasoul.

221
00:22:37,490 --> 00:22:40,493
Who made you, who protected you

222
00:22:40,528 --> 00:22:42,864
when you were being fucked hard.

223
00:22:54,709 --> 00:22:56,143
<i>Salaam Alaikum.</i>

224
00:23:42,823 --> 00:23:44,792
<i>As the United</i>
<i>States, Israel</i>

225
00:23:44,825 --> 00:23:47,094
and other Western powers
continue to deny

226
00:23:47,128 --> 00:23:48,729
any involvement in the sabotage

227
00:23:48,763 --> 00:23:51,132
of Iran's nuclear
reactor today near Kam

228
00:23:51,165 --> 00:23:53,634
there are still no suspects.

229
00:23:53,668 --> 00:23:56,871
Many are reminded of Stuxnet,
the malicious computer virus

230
00:23:56,904 --> 00:23:59,941
that caused the centrifuge
meltdown of their tanks facility

231
00:23:59,974 --> 00:24:02,610
that incident followed
on for many other incidents...

232
00:24:57,331 --> 00:24:58,866
<i>Are you still</i>
<i>coming home tomorrow?</i>

233
00:24:58,899 --> 00:25:02,670
No, Mr. Hans wants
me in Berlin first thing.

234
00:25:02,703 --> 00:25:05,239
Oh, wait, so
you're going to Berlin?

235
00:25:05,272 --> 00:25:07,575
Yeah, I have
to supervise the edit.

236
00:25:07,608 --> 00:25:09,276
Well, Lilly and I are
sure proud of you.

237
00:25:09,310 --> 00:25:11,212
- You did it.
- Oh, thanks, love.

238
00:25:11,245 --> 00:25:12,980
I miss you both so much.

239
00:25:15,016 --> 00:25:16,984
- Has she been good?
- Yeah, she's been...

240
00:25:18,185 --> 00:25:19,220
Wait, w-- w-- what?

241
00:25:19,253 --> 00:25:22,023
Help! Help me!

242
00:25:22,056 --> 00:25:23,290
Are you okay?

243
00:25:23,324 --> 00:25:24,592
- Help!
- What's going on?

244
00:25:24,625 --> 00:25:26,160
Answer me! Luna!

245
00:25:26,193 --> 00:25:27,628
- Help!
- I'll call the police!

246
00:26:48,275 --> 00:26:50,678
Whoa! There he is!

247
00:26:51,345 --> 00:26:53,380
Ah! Bring it in!

248
00:26:53,414 --> 00:26:54,849
- How are you?
- Fine.

249
00:26:56,250 --> 00:26:58,719
Come on, let's get you a drink.

250
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,726
Good to see you
all in one piece.

251
00:27:14,401 --> 00:27:16,137
It's all for show.

252
00:27:16,971 --> 00:27:19,006
The usual?

253
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:31,152
Cheers!

254
00:27:31,185 --> 00:27:33,687
Sick and tired
of working in this cesspool

255
00:27:33,721 --> 00:27:35,389
while looking for
the American dream.

256
00:27:35,422 --> 00:27:37,892
Yeah, why am I here, Roman?

257
00:27:38,726 --> 00:27:40,694
Your flight was delayed.

258
00:27:40,728 --> 00:27:42,163
Well, I know.

259
00:27:43,264 --> 00:27:45,933
It leaves in 92 minutes.

260
00:27:45,966 --> 00:27:47,768
Hmm.

261
00:27:47,801 --> 00:27:49,336
I'm gonna push it back again!

262
00:27:54,074 --> 00:27:55,009
Come with me.

263
00:27:56,477 --> 00:27:58,345
And they said
it couldn't be done.

264
00:27:58,379 --> 00:27:59,947
My favorite horse...

265
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:02,383
always delivers.

266
00:28:02,416 --> 00:28:04,051
Yeah, they'll just
build another one.

267
00:28:04,084 --> 00:28:05,953
Of course they will.

268
00:28:05,986 --> 00:28:08,455
And that's why I need
you for the next phase.

269
00:28:08,489 --> 00:28:09,757
Yeah, when I get back.

270
00:28:09,790 --> 00:28:13,060
No, no, this one can't wait.

271
00:28:13,093 --> 00:28:14,228
Come upstairs.

272
00:28:17,831 --> 00:28:19,967
I don't know, you just
tell me when to stop.

273
00:28:23,470 --> 00:28:25,206
I told you, Roman.

274
00:28:26,307 --> 00:28:28,075
When I get back.

275
00:28:28,108 --> 00:28:30,010
Job starts tomorrow,
three days work.

276
00:28:30,044 --> 00:28:32,379
You'll be back in time
for Ida's graduation.

277
00:28:32,413 --> 00:28:34,815
Oh, are you
tapping my phones now?

278
00:28:34,848 --> 00:28:37,084
This job is making you paranoid.

279
00:28:37,117 --> 00:28:40,087
You're gonna sign
those divorce papers?

280
00:28:40,120 --> 00:28:41,956
Stay out my fucking
personal life, alright?

281
00:28:41,989 --> 00:28:43,991
- What personal life?
- Yeah.

282
00:28:45,993 --> 00:28:47,962
I worry about you, Tommy.

283
00:28:47,995 --> 00:28:50,798
Maybe if you open your mind,
you could find some peace, too.

284
00:28:52,099 --> 00:28:53,434
I sure did.

285
00:28:53,467 --> 00:28:55,202
Right, yeah.

286
00:29:02,276 --> 00:29:03,844
Okay, do it for Ida then.

287
00:29:03,877 --> 00:29:06,981
She wants to be a doctor, right?
Hmm?

288
00:29:07,014 --> 00:29:09,183
You could put her through
any medical school she wants.

289
00:29:18,192 --> 00:29:19,360
Where's the job?

290
00:29:23,230 --> 00:29:25,099
Here.

291
00:29:25,132 --> 00:29:28,369
Melting Iran's shiny
new toy was just the beginning.

292
00:29:28,402 --> 00:29:30,037
<i>Langley wants a covert airstrip</i>

293
00:29:30,070 --> 00:29:32,406
<i>just across the Afghan border</i>
<i>near Taybad.</i>

294
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:35,075
We're gonna go in there and
destroy their whole nuclear

295
00:29:35,109 --> 00:29:39,013
program before they have the
chance to build the big bomb.

296
00:29:39,046 --> 00:29:41,815
You'll insert here
on the Afghan side in Iran.

297
00:29:41,849 --> 00:29:45,819
Jesus. Herat is crawling
with foreign spooks.

298
00:29:45,853 --> 00:29:47,522
And you can't get
anybody else for this?

299
00:29:47,555 --> 00:29:49,356
I don't want anybody else.

300
00:29:49,390 --> 00:29:52,159
Only know with you, it's
not just all about the money.

301
00:29:55,362 --> 00:29:56,463
Alright.

302
00:29:57,865 --> 00:29:59,601
See this?

303
00:29:59,634 --> 00:30:01,902
Taliban control all of this.

304
00:30:01,935 --> 00:30:04,038
Right? North, west, east.

305
00:30:04,071 --> 00:30:07,509
And your warring militias
taking shots at them all.

306
00:30:07,542 --> 00:30:09,043
- What's the cover story?
- There's none.

307
00:30:09,076 --> 00:30:10,844
It's black through and through.

308
00:30:10,878 --> 00:30:12,813
- You're on your own.
- Fuck.

309
00:30:16,950 --> 00:30:18,986
Alright, if I do this,

310
00:30:19,019 --> 00:30:21,088
I'm going to need a handler,
a good one.

311
00:30:21,121 --> 00:30:23,457

317
00:30:36,671 --> 00:30:40,174
I brought you change of clothes.

318
00:30:40,207 --> 00:30:43,243
Is there anyone around here
who drives a brand new SUV?

319
00:30:43,277 --> 00:30:46,046
You know we're supposed
to blend in, right?

320
00:30:46,080 --> 00:30:50,050
We will. Americans left dozens
of these at the embassy.

321
00:30:50,084 --> 00:30:52,252
Even these drug dealers
have one of these.

322
00:31:08,402 --> 00:31:09,903
Where's the safe house?

323
00:31:09,937 --> 00:31:12,306
Kandahar,
which is north of Herat.

324
00:31:12,339 --> 00:31:13,641
Taliban?

325
00:31:13,675 --> 00:31:15,976
Yeah.
The country is locked up tight.

326
00:31:16,009 --> 00:31:19,113
So, I mean,
if you need something,

327
00:31:19,146 --> 00:31:22,015
just let me know.
I will make a run.

328
00:31:22,049 --> 00:31:24,552
So I take it
you're from around here?

329
00:31:24,586 --> 00:31:27,988
Yeah, born and raised
till I was 16.

330
00:31:28,021 --> 00:31:29,657
Will anyone recognize you?

331
00:31:29,691 --> 00:31:33,160
No, I don't think so.

332
00:31:33,193 --> 00:31:36,397
Yeah, I haven't been here
for a very long time.

333
00:31:36,430 --> 00:31:38,399
I mostly lived in Kabul.

334
00:31:53,748 --> 00:31:56,049
Welcome to New Afghanistan.

335
00:31:58,252 --> 00:31:59,987
Same as the old.

336
00:32:00,555 --> 00:32:01,922
Yeah.

337
00:32:23,711 --> 00:32:26,146
My name is Farzad Asadi.

338
00:32:26,180 --> 00:32:29,216
I'm a colonel in the Islamic
Revolutionary Guard corps.

339
00:32:29,717 --> 00:32:31,218
Jerusalem force.

340
00:32:32,352 --> 00:32:34,522
I'm not a spy.

341
00:32:34,556 --> 00:32:36,658
I know you're not a spy.

342
00:32:36,691 --> 00:32:38,459
Then why am I here?

343
00:32:44,231 --> 00:32:45,332
Come on.

344
00:32:54,509 --> 00:32:56,243
I have a daughter, too.

345
00:32:58,479 --> 00:33:01,348
Help me get you home.

346
00:33:01,381 --> 00:33:02,750
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

347
00:33:02,784 --> 00:33:05,285
Two days ago, an American
named James Vincent

348
00:33:05,319 --> 00:33:08,322
sent you information about
my country's nuclear program.

349
00:33:08,355 --> 00:33:11,726
And now one of our nuclear
plants has been sabotaged.

350
00:33:11,759 --> 00:33:14,629
Tell me about the company
you were researching.

351
00:33:14,662 --> 00:33:16,463
You had files on your computer.

352
00:33:16,497 --> 00:33:18,633
A Swiss company, Civlix.

353
00:33:18,666 --> 00:33:21,569
Okay, if you look at
Civlix locations...

354
00:33:24,304 --> 00:33:27,675
they were working exclusively
in the nuclear

355
00:33:27,709 --> 00:33:29,511
and military facilities.

356
00:33:30,845 --> 00:33:34,114
Any names at Civlix? Please.

357
00:33:34,147 --> 00:33:37,050
We didn't get any names. We
didn't-- we didn't get any...

358
00:33:37,084 --> 00:33:40,420
- No-- no names. We don't--
- Give me some names.

359
00:33:40,454 --> 00:33:43,190
I'm telling you the truth.
We didn't get any names.

360
00:33:48,696 --> 00:33:50,532
Please believe me.

361
00:33:50,565 --> 00:33:52,332
Wait. Please believe me.

362
00:33:52,366 --> 00:33:55,269
Please.
You said I could go home.

363
00:33:56,604 --> 00:33:58,673
You will.

364
00:33:58,706 --> 00:34:00,274
As a martyr.

365
00:34:02,844 --> 00:34:04,812
Please!

366
00:34:04,846 --> 00:34:07,414
You said, I could go
home. Please.

367
00:34:48,823 --> 00:34:51,325
There's only one bedroom.

368
00:34:51,358 --> 00:34:52,259
Okay.

369
00:35:01,502 --> 00:35:04,171
Package arrived for you
yesterday.

370
00:35:39,339 --> 00:35:41,208
What is your mission?

371
00:35:43,276 --> 00:35:45,445
Go to Landing Strip near Taybad.

372
00:35:46,346 --> 00:35:48,683
Taybad. Taybad is in Iran.

373
00:35:49,717 --> 00:35:51,451
We leave at sundown.

374
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:54,187
What do you mean we?

375
00:35:55,723 --> 00:35:57,859
What, Roman didn't tell you?

376
00:35:57,892 --> 00:36:00,427
No, he just said
I'm supposed to pick you up

377
00:36:00,460 --> 00:36:04,231
and be your translator,
but here in Herat.

378
00:36:11,706 --> 00:36:13,306
Alright, call him.

379
00:37:05,560 --> 00:37:06,728
Salaam Alaikum.

380
00:39:48,589 --> 00:39:49,790
<i>C-I-A...</i>

381
00:39:51,692 --> 00:39:53,761
Breaking news
from Der Herald newspaper

382
00:39:53,794 --> 00:39:56,764
exposing the CIA's
illegal black operations

383
00:39:56,797 --> 00:39:57,965
in the Middle East.

384
00:39:57,999 --> 00:39:59,533
They include the
sabotage of Iran's

385
00:39:59,567 --> 00:40:02,036
top secret
nuclear reactor near Qom.

386
00:40:02,069 --> 00:40:04,205
The information was leaked
by a Pentagon

387
00:40:04,238 --> 00:40:06,107
whistle-blower after passing
classified documents...

388
00:40:06,140 --> 00:40:08,643
Come on now, hurry,
pick up the phone.

389
00:40:08,676 --> 00:40:09,610
missing.

390
00:40:09,644 --> 00:40:11,178
Many speculate she's being held

391
00:40:11,212 --> 00:40:14,481
in an Iranian prison
awaiting public execution.

392
00:40:30,231 --> 00:40:32,566
Focuses on CIA operatives
who posed

393
00:40:32,600 --> 00:40:34,467
as telecommunication
contractors

394
00:40:34,502 --> 00:40:36,070
for a Swiss company called,
Civlix

395
00:40:36,103 --> 00:40:38,539
causing the meltdown
of Iran's reactor.

396
00:40:38,572 --> 00:40:40,808
The fallout from this disclosure
could be devastating

397
00:40:40,841 --> 00:40:42,076
for Western interests.

398
00:40:43,711 --> 00:40:45,212
- Yo.
- Put the news on.

399
00:40:45,246 --> 00:40:46,948
Any channel.

400
00:40:46,981 --> 00:40:49,684
Just have him and tell the guy
watching the safehouse.

401
00:40:49,717 --> 00:40:51,852
There was a breach
at the Pentagon.

402
00:40:51,886 --> 00:40:52,987
We're exposed.

403
00:40:54,121 --> 00:40:55,690
How bad?

404
00:40:55,723 --> 00:40:57,825
They got your picture
and your alias

405
00:40:57,858 --> 00:40:59,492
but not your real name.

406
00:41:02,630 --> 00:41:04,832
Can't get in touch
with Oliver, Tommy.

407
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:25,286
What's the play?

408
00:41:25,319 --> 00:41:26,587
Well, mission's aborted.

409
00:41:26,620 --> 00:41:28,122
Let me get you out of there.

410
00:41:28,155 --> 00:41:29,623
Hang tight.

411
00:43:08,989 --> 00:43:11,225
Roman, I've got
Chris Hoyt here with me.

412
00:43:11,258 --> 00:43:13,360
Head of our
special operations group.

413
00:43:13,394 --> 00:43:15,963
The deputy director
asked him to sit in.

414
00:43:15,996 --> 00:43:17,765
- More the merrier.
- The field asset.

415
00:43:17,798 --> 00:43:19,800
- Tell me about him. Who is he?
- Tom Harris.

416
00:43:19,834 --> 00:43:22,703
A lifer. A loan to us from MI6.

417
00:43:22,736 --> 00:43:25,372
Total chameleon. He's one of my
go to low-vis guys.

418
00:43:25,406 --> 00:43:28,709
And he's running with
a former Afghan translator

419
00:43:28,742 --> 00:43:30,377
that we flew in to assist.

420
00:43:30,411 --> 00:43:31,745
Sounds like the life
of the party.

421
00:43:31,779 --> 00:43:33,380
Are the Iranians
their only problem?

422
00:43:33,414 --> 00:43:34,815
Are you joking?

423
00:43:34,849 --> 00:43:36,250
I mean, Afghanistan right now

424
00:43:36,283 --> 00:43:37,918
is like Cold War Berlin.

425
00:43:37,952 --> 00:43:40,788
Yeah, Talibs, Paks, Indians,
Russians, Chinese,

426
00:43:40,821 --> 00:43:43,357
and then you got ISISK

427
00:43:43,390 --> 00:43:45,392
too backwards for even Al-Qaeda.

428
00:43:45,426 --> 00:43:47,294
Any of them catch my guy

429
00:43:47,328 --> 00:43:49,730
will sell him
to the highest bidder.

430
00:43:49,763 --> 00:43:52,800
Unfortunately, we're gonna have
to cut them loose.

431
00:43:52,833 --> 00:43:55,903
- We have no other options.
- Yes, we do. Chris, come on.

432
00:43:55,936 --> 00:43:59,240
You know that 22 SAS
is in country right now.

433
00:43:59,273 --> 00:44:01,175
Hunting Al-Qaeda's
second in command.

434
00:44:02,443 --> 00:44:04,278
He's right.

435
00:44:04,311 --> 00:44:06,413
The Brits' flight out leaves
in 30 hours.

436
00:44:10,017 --> 00:44:13,821
Okay, I'll have
the deputy director call MI6.

437
00:44:13,854 --> 00:44:15,856
I'm sure they'll be happy
to get their man back.

438
00:44:18,759 --> 00:44:20,427
I'm doing the burn run now.

439
00:44:20,461 --> 00:44:22,796
I'm sorry, Tommy.

440
00:44:22,830 --> 00:44:24,732
This is your only shot
of getting out.

441
00:44:24,765 --> 00:44:27,401
That's alright.
I know what I signed up for.

442
00:44:27,434 --> 00:44:31,038
If anyone can make it, it's you.

443
00:44:32,173 --> 00:44:33,874
Extraction point...

444
00:44:33,908 --> 00:44:37,411
is an old CIA base
in Kandahar province

445
00:44:37,444 --> 00:44:39,346
using a C-130.

446
00:44:39,380 --> 00:44:41,182
Less than a minute
on the ground.

447
00:44:41,215 --> 00:44:43,317
How far from Kandahar
are they?

448
00:44:43,350 --> 00:44:44,919
About 400 miles.

449
00:44:44,952 --> 00:44:48,189
But the distance
is not the main issue.

450
00:44:48,222 --> 00:44:49,823
It's what's in between.

451
00:45:09,176 --> 00:45:10,144
Alright.

452
00:45:13,881 --> 00:45:15,316
What are you doing?

453
00:45:16,417 --> 00:45:18,118
Cover's blown.

454
00:45:18,152 --> 00:45:20,254
- Get your stuff.
- How?

455
00:45:20,287 --> 00:45:21,956
Doesn't matter how.

456
00:45:21,989 --> 00:45:24,291
We'll leave for Kandahar
in 15 minutes.

457
00:45:24,325 --> 00:45:27,328
Kandahar? We were supposed
to leave from here tomorrow.

458
00:45:29,196 --> 00:45:30,731
Not anymore.

459
00:45:36,136 --> 00:45:37,271
Come on. Let's go.

460
00:46:04,231 --> 00:46:05,966
Slumming it with us again.

461
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:10,204
Rasoul, I need a crew for snatch
and drive in Gandhar.

462
00:46:10,237 --> 00:46:11,972
Use your red units.

463
00:46:12,006 --> 00:46:14,008
Not those guys who are always
high on bugs spray.

464
00:46:34,862 --> 00:46:36,230
Okay, okay, okay. Yeah.

465
00:46:36,263 --> 00:46:38,132
Just make sure
your fucking crew is ready.

466
00:47:19,106 --> 00:47:20,608
They're out
of the safe house.

467
00:47:20,642 --> 00:47:22,109
Keep your eyes peeled
for hostiles.

468
00:47:22,142 --> 00:47:23,444
- Roger that.
- Start the clock.

469
00:47:23,477 --> 00:47:25,012
We engage if they make
contact?

470
00:47:25,045 --> 00:47:27,281
No way. We're not working
under title 50.

471
00:47:27,314 --> 00:47:28,650
No, we can only advise.

472
00:47:28,683 --> 00:47:31,085
They wonder why we can't win.

473
00:47:52,106 --> 00:47:53,641
Keep your eye out for a hoopty.

474
00:47:53,675 --> 00:47:55,677
- For what?
- It's a shitty car.

475
00:47:55,710 --> 00:47:58,212
We got to ditch this one.

476
00:47:58,245 --> 00:48:00,247
You know, maybe
we should have split up.

477
00:48:00,280 --> 00:48:02,249
I mean,
I can hide here for a few days

478
00:48:02,282 --> 00:48:04,318
and then take a flight
from Herat to Pakistan.

479
00:48:04,351 --> 00:48:06,220
Yeah, good idea, Mo.

480
00:48:06,253 --> 00:48:09,423
And get some rest before they
snatch you at Herat airport.

481
00:48:09,456 --> 00:48:11,125
That way, you'll last longer

482
00:48:11,158 --> 00:48:13,160
when they start pulling
your fingernails off.

483
00:48:17,297 --> 00:48:19,400
There's the market there.

484
00:48:19,433 --> 00:48:21,201
Okay, let's go this way.

485
00:48:45,627 --> 00:48:47,094
Where is he going?

486
00:48:47,127 --> 00:48:49,129
I see two SUV's
approaching the market.

487
00:48:54,401 --> 00:48:55,369
Here.

488
00:48:58,773 --> 00:49:01,041
Take the bags off the back.

489
00:49:01,074 --> 00:49:03,177
Wait for my signal, okay?

490
00:49:03,210 --> 00:49:04,111
Okay.

491
00:49:52,527 --> 00:49:53,528
Oy, oy, oy!

492
00:50:10,244 --> 00:50:11,779
They're switching into a
white Nissan pickup.

493
00:50:11,813 --> 00:50:13,180
White Nissan.

494
00:50:13,213 --> 00:50:14,516
Someone try to get the
plates.

495
00:50:41,576 --> 00:50:42,577
Shit.

496
00:50:43,678 --> 00:50:45,178
Coming to traffic.

497
00:50:45,212 --> 00:50:46,480
There are two vehicles
emerging.

498
00:50:46,514 --> 00:50:47,615
Ah.

499
00:50:49,249 --> 00:50:51,553
What's the way through this?

500
00:50:51,586 --> 00:50:54,087
The only way to Kandahar
is the highway one.

501
00:50:54,121 --> 00:50:55,657
It's on the other side
of the town.

502
00:51:35,228 --> 00:51:36,764
Tell him to get away
from the truck, Mo.

503
00:51:44,505 --> 00:51:46,908
Fuck!

504
00:51:46,941 --> 00:51:49,343
Fuck! Fuckin' clutch.

505
00:51:56,784 --> 00:51:58,352
Sorry.

506
00:51:58,385 --> 00:51:59,520
I am sorry.

507
00:52:08,796 --> 00:52:10,330
Sorry, here, one minute.

508
00:52:17,270 --> 00:52:19,473
Yeah, here, here, here,
sorry, I'm sorry, okay.

509
00:52:56,678 --> 00:52:59,312
Tom! Tom, go!

510
00:53:55,770 --> 00:53:57,572
Highway one is straight ahead.

511
00:54:03,611 --> 00:54:04,545
What are you doing?

512
00:54:07,548 --> 00:54:09,984
I'm telling you
we are going the wrong way.

513
00:54:10,017 --> 00:54:11,686
No, it's a detour.

514
00:54:20,561 --> 00:54:21,562
Get down!

515
00:54:37,879 --> 00:54:39,747
God, I like this guy.
He is good.

516
00:55:22,857 --> 00:55:24,959
Oh, shit.

517
00:55:24,992 --> 00:55:26,694
Check for a spare tire
in the back.

518
00:55:31,732 --> 00:55:33,333
Oh, my God. Yes.

519
00:55:35,069 --> 00:55:37,437
Okay, I'll pull security.
You change the tire.

520
00:55:43,476 --> 00:55:45,680
Mo, Hurry up.
We're exposed out here.

521
00:55:45,713 --> 00:55:46,647
Yeah.

522
00:55:47,148 --> 00:55:48,816
Come on.

523
00:55:49,884 --> 00:55:51,451
What piece of shit!

524
00:55:51,484 --> 00:55:53,588
You do it yourself!

525
00:55:58,659 --> 00:56:01,596
It's the adrenaline.
You're coming down.

526
00:56:01,629 --> 00:56:03,798
- Try to drink some water.
- Who was the guy on the bike?

527
00:56:03,831 --> 00:56:07,400
I need you to focus, okay?
Just change the fucking tire!

528
00:56:08,035 --> 00:56:09,503
Well...

529
00:56:09,537 --> 00:56:11,873
Well, well, I know...

530
00:56:11,906 --> 00:56:13,941
I know when I'm being lied to.

531
00:56:15,042 --> 00:56:16,611
Mo, where are you going?

532
00:56:16,644 --> 00:56:20,147
I came here
to find my wife's sister.

533
00:56:20,181 --> 00:56:22,783
And that's exactly
what I'm going to do.

534
00:56:22,817 --> 00:56:25,519
- Your wife's sister?
- Yes. She was missing.

535
00:56:25,553 --> 00:56:27,989
I'm not leaving Herat
until I find her.

536
00:56:28,022 --> 00:56:31,092
Well, you're not gonna find her
if you're fucking dead.

537
00:56:31,125 --> 00:56:32,793
Good luck to you.

538
00:56:49,911 --> 00:56:51,178
- Mo?
- Huh?

539
00:56:51,212 --> 00:56:52,980
Call him to come out.

540
00:57:05,993 --> 00:57:08,461
Tom, Tom,
he's just a little boy.

541
00:57:15,102 --> 00:57:17,104
Tell him to drop it.

542
00:57:27,949 --> 00:57:29,550
Jesus.

543
00:57:39,994 --> 00:57:42,596
You won't make it
on your own, Mo.

544
00:57:42,630 --> 00:57:44,532
Then tell me
what's truly going on.

545
00:57:48,602 --> 00:57:50,538
This is my life in your hands.

546
00:57:52,673 --> 00:57:55,810
I burned their house down
in Iran.

547
00:57:55,843 --> 00:57:57,477
The nuclear reactor?

548
00:58:01,315 --> 00:58:04,185
Why can't CIA agents
just come and pick us up?

549
00:58:04,218 --> 00:58:06,887
We're cutouts
in an even bigger game.

550
00:58:06,921 --> 00:58:10,024
But what it means is
no one is coming to rescue us.

551
00:58:11,225 --> 00:58:12,593
Okay?

552
00:58:14,028 --> 00:58:17,198
So we just got to
get to Kandahar,

553
00:58:17,231 --> 00:58:18,799
and then we'll regroup,

554
00:58:23,704 --> 00:58:25,573
Okay?

555
00:58:25,606 --> 00:58:27,608
And then I'll help you
find your wife's sister.

556
00:58:29,276 --> 00:58:32,146
I'm sorry, Mo.

557
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:34,015
I should have told you
the truth earlier.

558
00:59:28,836 --> 00:59:31,672
Do you really think
we can make it to Kandahar?

559
00:59:31,705 --> 00:59:34,675
Not without help.

560
00:59:34,708 --> 00:59:37,078
There's someone I've worked with
before south of here.

561
00:59:38,312 --> 00:59:40,081
And maybe he has a helicopter.

562
00:59:42,049 --> 00:59:43,651
Let's go.

563
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:11,378
<i>Asalamualaikum.</i>

564
01:00:11,412 --> 01:00:14,181
Ismail, it's Roman.

565
01:00:14,215 --> 01:00:15,382
Look, I need a favor.

566
01:02:14,301 --> 01:02:15,869
Mm-hmm.

567
01:02:21,408 --> 01:02:22,810
Huh.

568
01:04:03,645 --> 01:04:07,014
Ah...

569
01:04:07,047 --> 01:04:09,083
How much longer
to your friend?

570
01:04:09,116 --> 01:04:11,852
About another 20 miles or so.

571
01:04:17,391 --> 01:04:19,059
Do you hear this?

572
01:04:21,362 --> 01:04:23,163
- Yeah.
- I-- I...

573
01:04:23,197 --> 01:04:26,367
I think there is something wrong
with the tire again.

574
01:04:29,937 --> 01:04:31,338
That's not our car.

575
01:04:58,399 --> 01:04:59,366
Take the wheel, Mo!

576
01:05:03,971 --> 01:05:07,408
- I can't see where I'm going!
- Just keep it straight!

577
01:06:01,395 --> 01:06:02,463
Ah!

578
01:06:07,735 --> 01:06:09,537
The engine's down!

579
01:06:09,571 --> 01:06:11,338
Get ready to bail.

580
01:06:13,808 --> 01:06:15,342
Let's go! Move, move!

581
01:06:27,154 --> 01:06:28,222
Run, Mo!

582
01:06:30,123 --> 01:06:32,259
- Where?
- Just run!

583
01:09:23,296 --> 01:09:25,298
You'll always be...

584
01:09:36,944 --> 01:09:40,548
That's our comeback ride.
Stay down, don't move.

585
01:09:40,581 --> 01:09:41,616
Alright.

586
01:10:48,516 --> 01:10:52,720
Oh, God,
forgive our living and our dead.

587
01:10:52,754 --> 01:10:54,822
Yeah, used me as bait.

588
01:10:56,023 --> 01:10:57,625
But it worked.

589
01:11:06,601 --> 01:11:09,036
- Looks like we're on foot.
- Huh.

590
01:11:11,572 --> 01:11:13,508
We're-we're refueling the UAV.

591
01:11:13,541 --> 01:11:16,644
- Where are they now?
- We've lost 'em.

592
01:11:16,677 --> 01:11:20,648
- Has Roman checked in?
- No. Why?

593
01:11:22,817 --> 01:11:24,384
- Copy.
- Should I be worried?

594
01:11:26,521 --> 01:11:28,388
If those were my guys,
I'd be blowing up your phone

595
01:11:28,421 --> 01:11:29,389
every ten minutes.

596
01:11:42,103 --> 01:11:44,806
Are you sure you don't want me
to wait up for ya?

597
01:11:44,839 --> 01:11:46,707
What are you gonna do
if we can't find you?

598
01:11:46,741 --> 01:11:49,811
I'm practically the only
white dude left in this country.

599
01:11:49,844 --> 01:11:53,380
Can't be too hard to find.
Get home safe, brother.

600
01:12:38,659 --> 01:12:39,627
Ah.

601
01:12:41,829 --> 01:12:45,833
May the dust rise
and the apostles hear a cry.

602
01:12:49,136 --> 01:12:50,771
Let's do it.

603
01:13:14,795 --> 01:13:16,197
I have to pray.

604
01:13:22,937 --> 01:13:23,938
Ah.

605
01:13:25,506 --> 01:13:30,645
Ah. My knees are killing me.

606
01:13:30,678 --> 01:13:33,180
Here. Ah.

607
01:13:33,214 --> 01:13:34,815
Take this.

608
01:13:48,229 --> 01:13:49,830
Thank you.

609
01:14:35,743 --> 01:14:36,811
Thank you.

610
01:14:47,154 --> 01:14:50,992
Not exactly best way
to break a fast,

611
01:14:51,025 --> 01:14:54,195
but it's all I've got.

612
01:15:07,675 --> 01:15:08,809
Mm...

613
01:15:17,051 --> 01:15:18,686
Battle buddy?

614
01:15:24,091 --> 01:15:25,793
His name is Siddiqui.

615
01:15:27,795 --> 01:15:31,766
He was my translator
through six tours.

616
01:15:33,934 --> 01:15:36,904
For six fucking tours.

617
01:15:36,937 --> 01:15:41,275
Tried to get him
to the, the US or London.

618
01:15:41,308 --> 01:15:43,778
Anywhere safe.

619
01:15:43,811 --> 01:15:46,347
Then ISIS rode through Mosul...

620
01:15:46,380 --> 01:15:48,682
and they hung him.

621
01:15:49,917 --> 01:15:51,152
My pleader.

622
01:15:55,656 --> 01:15:57,958
Yeah, we rely on you guys
for everything.

623
01:16:00,628 --> 01:16:03,831
I mean, the language,
the culture.

624
01:16:06,233 --> 01:16:09,837
You risk your lives for us...

625
01:16:12,039 --> 01:16:14,075
and then we tell you exactly

626
01:16:14,108 --> 01:16:17,178
what your country should look
like and how you should act.

627
01:16:20,281 --> 01:16:23,584
Half the time
we don't even say thank you.

628
01:16:25,686 --> 01:16:28,756
Oh, no, I'm glad you made it
to the States, Mo.

629
01:16:30,091 --> 01:16:31,725
Got your family out.

630
01:16:33,160 --> 01:16:34,962
Not all of them made it.

631
01:16:37,731 --> 01:16:41,135
My oldest son, Hamid,
was killed here.

632
01:16:48,109 --> 01:16:49,743
Are you married?

633
01:16:52,880 --> 01:16:54,415
I was.

634
01:16:54,448 --> 01:16:57,918
- Do you have kids?
- I do.

635
01:16:57,952 --> 01:17:00,721
I have a, a photo.

636
01:17:09,330 --> 01:17:13,000
Ida. She's, uh,
she's, uh, 17.

637
01:17:13,033 --> 01:17:14,702
She's beautiful.

638
01:17:15,903 --> 01:17:17,738
Ah. Thanks.

639
01:17:21,475 --> 01:17:24,979
I was supposed to be
at her graduation this weekend.

640
01:17:26,180 --> 01:17:27,915
You have to go home, Tom.

641
01:17:30,184 --> 01:17:33,420
You have to go home
and hold her in your arms

642
01:17:33,454 --> 01:17:36,857
before you even forget
what it feels like.

643
01:17:37,825 --> 01:17:41,729
See, my, my Hamid is gone,

644
01:17:41,762 --> 01:17:45,132
and all I have left
is just the picture.

645
01:17:50,271 --> 01:17:51,839
You know, it's funny.

646
01:17:54,141 --> 01:17:57,044
Here I am,
talking to a guy I barely know.

647
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:04,018
Somehow, I, I'm more comfortable
with you than I am with family.

648
01:18:12,493 --> 01:18:14,128
Excuse me.

649
01:19:45,319 --> 01:19:48,422
That's them. Raise your hands.

650
01:19:48,455 --> 01:19:50,824
Let 'em know we're not a threat.

651
01:19:50,858 --> 01:19:53,060
That's a flag of Tajik warlord.

652
01:19:55,362 --> 01:19:56,897
I know.

653
01:20:00,868 --> 01:20:03,937
Say we're friends
of Ismail Rabbani.

654
01:20:03,971 --> 01:20:05,973
We're asking Rabbani for help?

655
01:20:06,006 --> 01:20:08,309
Do it before they get
trigger-happy, Mo.

656
01:20:14,114 --> 01:20:15,182
<i>Salam Alaikum.</i>

657
01:21:29,423 --> 01:21:32,025
- Ismail Rabbani.
- Heh-heh.

658
01:21:32,059 --> 01:21:35,597
My friend, your face
is all over the news.

659
01:21:35,630 --> 01:21:37,998
- Ah.
- Good to see you.

660
01:21:40,334 --> 01:21:43,904
Been too long.
This is, uh, Mohammed.

661
01:21:49,042 --> 01:21:50,978
<i>Asalamualaikum.</i>

662
01:21:55,382 --> 01:21:57,050
<i>Wa-alaikum-salam.</i>

663
01:22:01,255 --> 01:22:04,726
So what brings you
to Farah?

664
01:22:04,759 --> 01:22:06,493
We have to get to Kandahar.

665
01:22:06,528 --> 01:22:09,062
Oh, if you'd only
come by yesterday,

666
01:22:09,096 --> 01:22:11,666
I would have flown you myself.

667
01:22:11,699 --> 01:22:13,200
Well, the Taliban
borrow my helicopter

668
01:22:13,233 --> 01:22:15,202
for operation in the north. Hm.

669
01:22:17,237 --> 01:22:19,707
I can give you a truck.
I have plenty of those.

670
01:22:19,741 --> 01:22:22,009
You will be there
in three hours.

671
01:22:22,042 --> 01:22:23,745
- My brother.
- We are about to eat.

672
01:22:23,778 --> 01:22:25,513
Are you hungry?

673
01:22:31,586 --> 01:22:33,153
Our morning's work.

674
01:22:39,026 --> 01:22:41,495
Sure had some good times
together, huh,

675
01:22:41,529 --> 01:22:44,298
facing them Osama's boys.

676
01:22:44,331 --> 01:22:47,334
Yeah, we gave them a run for
their money. That's for sure.

677
01:22:47,367 --> 01:22:50,270
Feels like a lifetime ago,
but don't worry,

678
01:22:50,304 --> 01:22:53,207
soon we will be
all back at it again.

679
01:22:53,240 --> 01:22:55,142
The harder you try to stamp out
an ideology,

680
01:22:55,175 --> 01:22:57,077
the stronger it becomes.

681
01:23:04,318 --> 01:23:06,588
Hm?

682
01:23:06,621 --> 01:23:09,557
Hm. What is
with the good Muslim boy?

683
01:23:14,495 --> 01:23:16,096
Ah.

684
01:23:44,559 --> 01:23:48,295
Mo... what are you doing?

685
01:23:48,328 --> 01:23:52,399
Your friend is a warlord
who razed Herat.

686
01:23:52,432 --> 01:23:54,167
It was only business.

687
01:23:55,603 --> 01:23:57,539
A higher bidder paid me for it.

688
01:23:57,572 --> 01:23:59,172
And I will do it again
just like I did

689
01:23:59,206 --> 01:24:02,142
for the Russians,
I did it for ISI.

690
01:24:02,175 --> 01:24:05,547
I did it for Americans
and I will do it for Taliban.

691
01:24:05,580 --> 01:24:10,117
You killed
thousands. Women and children.

692
01:24:10,150 --> 01:24:12,554
One of them was my son.

693
01:24:31,471 --> 01:24:33,675
Ismail, well--

694
01:24:33,708 --> 01:24:36,578
Is that what you want? Huh?

695
01:24:38,145 --> 01:24:40,447
Is that it, revenge?
An eye for an eye?

696
01:24:42,617 --> 01:24:43,651
Hm.

697
01:24:48,723 --> 01:24:51,358
Here, take it. It is only fair.

698
01:24:51,391 --> 01:24:54,062
A violent act must be met
with another.

699
01:24:57,632 --> 01:25:00,501
Go ahead. Take it.

700
01:25:11,646 --> 01:25:13,648
Ismail, come on.

701
01:25:13,681 --> 01:25:15,516
Stay out of it, Tom.

702
01:25:17,417 --> 01:25:19,621
Hm.

703
01:25:19,654 --> 01:25:22,790
Ever hear the story
of the Afghan man

704
01:25:22,824 --> 01:25:25,258
who lived for 700 years?

705
01:25:27,260 --> 01:25:31,633
On his 700th birthday, the great
Amir, Dost Mohammad Khan,

706
01:25:31,666 --> 01:25:33,367
threw him a, a lavish party.

707
01:25:33,400 --> 01:25:36,236
And after all the guests
had left,

708
01:25:36,269 --> 01:25:40,642
the Amir said in confidence,
"I am surrounded by enemies."

709
01:25:42,677 --> 01:25:46,914
"What is your secret to be
living in such dangerous place

710
01:25:46,948 --> 01:25:49,751
for a long time?"

711
01:25:49,784 --> 01:25:52,252
And the man looked at him
and said...

712
01:25:53,721 --> 01:25:57,592
"It is easy. Change sides."

713
01:25:59,560 --> 01:26:01,294
I know the story.

714
01:26:05,566 --> 01:26:07,669
And this way,

715
01:26:07,702 --> 01:26:11,438
our country can never be as one.

716
01:26:35,697 --> 01:26:37,197
Mo.

717
01:26:38,733 --> 01:26:39,767
Ismail.

718
01:26:49,476 --> 01:26:50,611
Oh.

719
01:26:56,483 --> 01:27:00,755
I-- I'm so sorry, Mo.
I-- I had no idea.

720
01:27:00,788 --> 01:27:04,391
You called him your brother.
Do you know how insulting this?

721
01:27:04,424 --> 01:27:07,028
He killed my son
and thousands more

722
01:27:07,061 --> 01:27:10,031
because of you and people
like you empowering him

723
01:27:10,064 --> 01:27:12,365
without caring about my people!

724
01:27:14,635 --> 01:27:15,703
Shame on you.

725
01:27:16,637 --> 01:27:17,805
Shame on you.

726
01:27:22,910 --> 01:27:26,346
Look, we can refuse his help

727
01:27:26,379 --> 01:27:29,617
and we just walk out of here.
You wanna do that, I'm in.

728
01:27:29,650 --> 01:27:32,553
Oh.

729
01:27:32,587 --> 01:27:34,989
I just want to go.

730
01:27:35,022 --> 01:27:38,793
I want to go to my family.
That's it.

731
01:27:40,094 --> 01:27:41,796
I just want to go home.

732
01:27:46,366 --> 01:27:48,703
Mo, this is our best chance.

733
01:28:21,434 --> 01:28:23,671
<i>Asalamualaikum.</i>

734
01:28:55,736 --> 01:28:56,737
<i>Behenchod.</i>

735
01:29:00,608 --> 01:29:01,576
Hello?

736
01:29:29,837 --> 01:29:31,438
London.

737
01:29:33,007 --> 01:29:35,176
Paris.

738
01:30:12,813 --> 01:30:15,549
Did you think that this will
ever end?

739
01:30:20,021 --> 01:30:22,690
Ancient wars were fought
for spoils.

740
01:30:24,125 --> 01:30:26,661
Modern wars
aren't meant to be won.

741
01:30:33,100 --> 01:30:34,936
Tom!

742
01:31:06,867 --> 01:31:08,602
Fucking Ismail.

743
01:31:13,140 --> 01:31:14,942
You should have shot him.

744
01:33:33,013 --> 01:33:35,850
I need air support now.

745
01:33:35,883 --> 01:33:37,852
Nah, nah, nah, nah.
Rasoul, don't be a bitch.

746
01:33:37,885 --> 01:33:39,120
Hold them off until I get there.

747
01:33:40,087 --> 01:33:41,155
Rasoul.

748
01:34:05,312 --> 01:34:06,347
Ah!

749
01:34:28,169 --> 01:34:29,203
Hit the gate!

750
01:34:30,204 --> 01:34:31,305
Hit the gate!

751
01:34:59,501 --> 01:35:01,135
<i>Allahu-Akbar!</i>

752
01:35:40,474 --> 01:35:41,976
Hello, Thomas.

753
01:35:42,009 --> 01:35:43,511
Oh, fuck you.

754
01:35:43,545 --> 01:35:45,913
- It's not funny. Ah.
- You okay?

755
01:35:45,946 --> 01:35:48,115
What happened?
How did you get here, man?

756
01:35:48,148 --> 01:35:49,517
Rode in with my Afghan.

757
01:35:49,551 --> 01:35:52,987
Special Forces buddies,
pretending to be ISIS.

758
01:35:53,020 --> 01:35:55,889
- Uh, pretty good, huh?
- Oh, fuck.

759
01:35:55,923 --> 01:35:57,791
Hey, wait, wait, wait.
What about Mo?

760
01:35:57,825 --> 01:35:59,860
He's in here somewhere.

761
01:35:59,893 --> 01:36:01,295
Let's go find him.

762
01:36:11,372 --> 01:36:12,806
Mo?

763
01:36:13,508 --> 01:36:14,908
Mo?

764
01:36:20,314 --> 01:36:22,783
Mo? Mo?

765
01:36:23,284 --> 01:36:24,351
Uh...

766
01:36:26,086 --> 01:36:28,355
Oh. Motherfucker!

767
01:36:28,389 --> 01:36:30,157
Roman, in here.

768
01:36:30,190 --> 01:36:33,561
You okay? I got you, Mo.
I got you. Jesus.

769
01:36:33,595 --> 01:36:35,496
I'm sorry, Mo.

770
01:36:35,530 --> 01:36:39,867
Come on. You get up.

771
01:36:39,900 --> 01:36:42,369
Out of here.
Out of here.

772
01:36:57,484 --> 01:36:59,186
Almost there. Hang on...

773
01:37:02,156 --> 01:37:04,592
Ah.

774
01:37:04,626 --> 01:37:06,260
What about your SF guys?
Can we get them out?

775
01:37:09,597 --> 01:37:11,899
They are never gonna
stop fighting.

776
01:37:41,663 --> 01:37:44,064
Sir, there they are.

777
01:37:44,098 --> 01:37:45,633
Moving in with Reaper.

778
01:37:45,667 --> 01:37:48,001
Confirming signal
from town's blue force.

779
01:38:11,492 --> 01:38:13,160
This guy doesn't quit.

780
01:38:14,428 --> 01:38:15,996
No, he doesn't.

781
01:38:25,439 --> 01:38:27,040
Stay on the fence line.

782
01:38:27,074 --> 01:38:28,676
There's a perimeter gate
four klicks up.

783
01:38:48,128 --> 01:38:50,164
He's right on our ass.

784
01:39:01,341 --> 01:39:02,544
Ah!

785
01:39:26,300 --> 01:39:27,367
Ah!

786
01:39:31,806 --> 01:39:34,041
Everybody okay? Mo, good?

787
01:39:34,074 --> 01:39:36,443
Ah, it's Roman. Oh, my God!

788
01:39:36,477 --> 01:39:38,045
- Shit.
- Ah.

789
01:39:38,078 --> 01:39:40,414
- Roman.
- He's bleeding very badly.

790
01:39:40,447 --> 01:39:42,483
Mo, find something
to pack him with. Quick.

791
01:39:42,517 --> 01:39:44,586
It's alright. It's alright.

792
01:39:48,255 --> 01:39:51,124
Roman, just hang on, okay?

793
01:39:51,158 --> 01:39:52,627
we're gonna make it
to the flight.

794
01:39:54,796 --> 01:39:56,531
- Roman!
- No, Roman!

795
01:40:01,201 --> 01:40:02,804
Tom, we have to go back.

796
01:42:05,660 --> 01:42:06,894
Alright, Mo. Get ready.

797
01:42:08,462 --> 01:42:09,496
Ah.

798
01:42:14,401 --> 01:42:18,338
Hang on, Mo.
Almost there!

799
01:42:18,372 --> 01:42:21,542
- We are not gonna make it, Tom.
- We're gonna make it.

800
01:42:25,312 --> 01:42:26,948
Copy, Bravo Six.
Prepare for landing.

801
01:42:40,828 --> 01:42:44,431
Multiple bogies emerging
from the north and east.

802
01:42:44,464 --> 01:42:45,967
RPG's spotted on the left
window.

803
01:42:46,000 --> 01:42:47,434
ETA on the Brit slide
is one minute.

804
01:42:47,467 --> 01:42:49,269
Christ, they're gonna
block the gate.

805
01:42:49,302 --> 01:42:50,672
Tell the birds
to hold the plane.

806
01:42:50,705 --> 01:42:51,639
Copy.

807
01:42:57,979 --> 01:43:00,447
Roger, Bravo Six.
Move your best to hold.

808
01:43:00,480 --> 01:43:02,817
However, we have targeted
civilian...

809
01:43:02,850 --> 01:43:04,284
Come, let's go, boys.

810
01:43:11,626 --> 01:43:13,260
I see the gate.

811
01:43:47,061 --> 01:43:49,797
- Hm?
- Tom?

812
01:44:25,533 --> 01:44:26,934
Stay here.

813
01:44:35,810 --> 01:44:38,513
He is going to kill you.

814
01:44:40,480 --> 01:44:41,949
Then I won't be lying down.

815
01:45:21,122 --> 01:45:22,890
Fuck.

816
01:45:48,149 --> 01:45:50,450
I've got you.

817
01:45:50,483 --> 01:45:52,720
I got you. Huh.

818
01:46:02,563 --> 01:46:03,931
Oh, shit.

819
01:46:04,799 --> 01:46:06,399
I'm sorry, Mo.

820
01:46:07,068 --> 01:46:08,502
I let you down.

821
01:46:13,174 --> 01:46:14,775
God's plan.

822
01:46:15,676 --> 01:46:16,978
God's plan?

823
01:46:21,649 --> 01:46:24,619
Counting up to 50-plus
bogies converging on the base.

824
01:46:25,920 --> 01:46:28,421
What's our Reaper armed with?

825
01:46:28,455 --> 01:46:30,423
She'd be using
Hellfire, sir.

826
01:46:32,593 --> 01:46:34,929
Text the pilot. Do it now.

827
01:46:34,962 --> 01:46:37,497
What are you doing?

828
01:46:37,531 --> 01:46:39,432
We don't have the authority.

829
01:46:39,466 --> 01:46:43,170
Fuck the authority.
They can fire me.

830
01:46:43,204 --> 01:46:45,640
I won't watch anymore of our men
die today.

831
01:46:48,475 --> 01:46:52,113
Tom...

832
01:46:52,146 --> 01:46:53,848
it's been an honor.

833
01:46:55,917 --> 01:46:57,551
Be honest, mate.

834
01:47:34,588 --> 01:47:36,023
Let's go home, Mo.

835
01:47:37,258 --> 01:47:38,726
Let's go.

836
01:48:02,950 --> 01:48:05,152
Go! Quick.

837
01:48:29,977 --> 01:48:31,045
Come on.

838
01:48:33,247 --> 01:48:34,648
Ah. Ah.

839
01:48:34,682 --> 01:48:36,751
We got wounded! We got wounded!

840
01:48:36,784 --> 01:48:38,152
Keep moving. Keep moving.
Keep moving.

841
01:48:38,185 --> 01:48:39,954
- Get a medic on it.
- Go! Let's go!

842
01:48:39,987 --> 01:48:41,589
Let's go, let's go!

843
01:49:32,640 --> 01:49:34,975
I will never see
my homeland again.

844
01:49:38,979 --> 01:49:41,248
Yes, you will.

845
01:49:41,282 --> 01:49:44,351
And I'll be with you...

846
01:49:44,385 --> 01:49:47,321
when you find
your wife's sister.

847
01:49:52,927 --> 01:49:54,361
Oh.

848
01:50:57,424 --> 01:50:58,859
You may go.

849
01:51:26,754 --> 01:51:29,190
I am glad you called.

850
01:51:29,223 --> 01:51:33,060
The Brits want to know
what happened to the reporter.

851
01:51:33,093 --> 01:51:37,398
When I captured that Mossad
agent in Tehran last year,

852
01:51:37,431 --> 01:51:40,201
I told him a simple truth.

853
01:51:40,234 --> 01:51:42,504
Spend too much time in Tehran,

854
01:51:42,537 --> 01:51:45,306
<i>and Israel was cease to exist.</i>

855
01:51:45,339 --> 01:51:46,974
<i>He took it as a threat.</i>

856
01:51:47,007 --> 01:51:50,211
But it was just
some friendly advice,

857
01:51:50,244 --> 01:51:52,514
from one countryman to another.

858
01:51:52,547 --> 01:51:54,848
<i>You have to return home...</i>

859
01:51:56,850 --> 01:51:59,286
<i>to know what you are</i>
<i>fighting for.</i>

860
01:52:00,854 --> 01:52:03,090
- Hey.
- Hey.

861
01:52:09,263 --> 01:52:10,898
You're home.

862
01:52:14,435 --> 01:52:17,004
What happened?

863
01:52:17,037 --> 01:52:18,072
Nothing.

864
01:52:23,877 --> 01:52:27,281
Ah. Well, you get so big.

865
01:52:27,314 --> 01:52:30,451
Dad, you don't tell your teenage
daughter she's getting big.

866
01:52:30,484 --> 01:52:33,020
Well...
Well, you know what I mean.

867
01:52:33,053 --> 01:52:34,121
Hm.
