1
00:00:00,311 --> 00:00:03,282
That's one small step for man,

2
00:00:05,654 --> 00:00:08,950
one giant leap for mankind.

4
00:01:10,282 --> 00:01:11,381
Box top.

5
00:01:11,383 --> 00:01:12,081
Huh?

6
00:01:12,083 --> 00:01:14,104
You need a top for your box.

7
00:01:14,106 --> 00:01:16,510
A top won't fit with all my trophies.

8
00:01:16,512 --> 00:01:18,253
Respect the hardware.

9
00:01:23,196 --> 00:01:28,383
There are far, far better things ahead
than any we leave behind.

10
00:01:28,782 --> 00:01:31,223
That's a little deep
for Cassidy Gordon, isn't it?

11
00:01:31,225 --> 00:01:32,374
I saw it online.

12
00:01:32,376 --> 00:01:33,166
All packed?

13
00:01:33,168 --> 00:01:34,781
One suitcase, one carry-on.

14
00:01:34,783 --> 00:01:37,552
The movers come for the rest tomorrow
after we leave.

15
00:01:37,554 --> 00:01:39,424
Wheels up at 9:00 AM.

16
00:01:39,426 --> 00:01:40,510
Wheels up.

17
00:01:40,512 --> 00:01:41,781
That's jivey.

18
00:01:41,783 --> 00:01:44,374
My dad's trying to make it sound exciting.

19
00:01:44,376 --> 00:01:46,940
Yeah, it's smart to keep things upbeat

20
00:01:46,942 --> 00:01:49,382
when you're ripping your family
from their beloved home.

21
00:01:49,384 --> 00:01:52,400
Cass, he's worked hard
for this opportunity.

22
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:55,391
I'm not thrilled about Wichita,
but he's happy.

23
00:01:55,393 --> 00:01:57,433
It's been a while since I could say that.

24
00:01:57,435 --> 00:01:59,501
Very mature, Baker.

25
00:02:01,608 --> 00:02:03,233
She would have been proud.

26
00:02:06,842 --> 00:02:08,099
Truth or death?

27
00:02:08,101 --> 00:02:10,048
Madison, the toilet's clogged again.

28
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:11,991
So unclog it, Paige.

29
00:02:11,993 --> 00:02:13,433
I didn't clog it.

30
00:02:13,435 --> 00:02:14,891
Cassie.

31
00:02:14,893 --> 00:02:16,424
We're leaving tomorrow.

32
00:02:16,426 --> 00:02:18,083
Are you going to miss me?

33
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:20,821
Only if my aim is off.

34
00:02:20,823 --> 00:02:22,700
Go pack something, tiny Baker.

35
00:02:22,811 --> 00:02:24,324
Why does she hate me?

36
00:02:24,326 --> 00:02:26,424
Cassie hates everyone.

37
00:02:26,426 --> 00:02:28,799
It's a big tent, animus.

38
00:02:28,801 --> 00:02:30,525
Where's Blaire?

39
00:02:32,142 --> 00:02:33,092
Hey, subs.

40
00:02:33,094 --> 00:02:35,523
We have arrived at the Baker house.

41
00:02:35,525 --> 00:02:38,238
A really big tent.

42
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,552
We are here live
for the final hours of Madison Baker's.

43
00:02:41,554 --> 00:02:42,558
Jesus, Blaire.

44
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:43,942
What's wrong with you?

45
00:02:44,367 --> 00:02:48,367
For the final hours
of Madison Baker's residentuality.

46
00:02:48,369 --> 00:02:50,181
That's not a word.

47
00:02:50,183 --> 00:02:51,495
She's a neologist.

48
00:02:51,497 --> 00:02:53,616
My hair looks amazing.

49
00:02:53,618 --> 00:02:55,167
And a narcissist.

50
00:02:55,367 --> 00:02:58,266
Madison, you have to unclog the toilet.

51
00:02:58,268 --> 00:02:59,581
Oh, I'm filming that.

52
00:02:59,583 --> 00:03:00,885
No.

53
00:03:02,896 --> 00:03:06,642
Since this has become a going-away party,
I'm going away.

54
00:03:06,767 --> 00:03:08,381
Cassie, wait.

55
00:03:08,383 --> 00:03:09,931
We can't say goodbye like this.

56
00:03:09,933 --> 00:03:10,757
I didn't say goodbye.

57
00:03:10,759 --> 00:03:11,500
Just stop.

58
00:03:11,750 --> 00:03:13,025
Toilet.

59
00:03:13,525 --> 00:03:15,010
Stay, Cass.

60
00:03:15,012 --> 00:03:17,375
This is our last chance to see each other.

61
00:03:18,896 --> 00:03:20,874
What if it's not our last chance?

62
00:03:20,876 --> 00:03:22,666
It's not going to unclog itself.

63
00:03:22,668 --> 00:03:25,723
What can I do to make you stop talking?

64
00:03:25,725 --> 00:03:27,211
Give me your phone.

65
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:29,750
What do you mean?

66
00:03:32,196 --> 00:03:34,567
The toilet is clogged again.

67
00:03:34,569 --> 00:03:35,738
Hi, Mr. Baker.

68
00:03:35,740 --> 00:03:36,753
Is there flooding?

69
00:03:36,755 --> 00:03:38,309
It's a disaster.

70
00:03:38,311 --> 00:03:39,967
Are you consuming too much fiber?

71
00:03:39,969 --> 00:03:40,853
No, Nina.

72
00:03:40,855 --> 00:03:42,275
Properly hydrated?

73
00:03:42,925 --> 00:03:45,306
Dad, I'm talking to my friends here.

74
00:03:45,308 --> 00:03:47,653
Oh, I'll take care of it.

75
00:03:47,655 --> 00:03:49,690
Take care of Paige too.

76
00:03:49,692 --> 00:03:51,392
Paige, inside.

77
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:57,216
Hanson, we all set for tomorrow?

78
00:03:57,682 --> 00:03:58,952
Bye, Mr. Baker.

79
00:03:58,954 --> 00:04:00,481
Goodbye, Paige.

80
00:04:00,483 --> 00:04:01,698
Can I use your phone?

81
00:04:01,700 --> 00:04:03,233
When I'm dead.

82
00:04:06,625 --> 00:04:08,896
I guess this is goodbye then?

83
00:04:10,192 --> 00:04:11,766
It doesn't have to be.

84
00:04:11,768 --> 00:04:14,133
This sounds deviant.

85
00:04:14,782 --> 00:04:16,610
Let's sneak out tonight,
you and me.

86
00:04:16,612 --> 00:04:17,394
And me.

87
00:04:17,396 --> 00:04:19,267
I'd be grounded forever.

88
00:04:19,269 --> 00:04:21,100
The tension rises.

89
00:04:21,212 --> 00:04:22,510
Two outcomes.

90
00:04:22,512 --> 00:04:25,667
One, you don't get caught
and sleep blissfully on the plane,

91
00:04:25,669 --> 00:04:28,124
dreaming of your subversive adventure.

92
00:04:28,126 --> 00:04:31,775
Or two, you do get caught
and you're grounded in Wichita,

93
00:04:31,792 --> 00:04:33,510
which sounds redundant.

94
00:04:33,512 --> 00:04:36,383
Either way,
you get a night to remember.

95
00:04:36,896 --> 00:04:39,111
Wichita is the air capital of the world.

96
00:04:39,882 --> 00:04:41,312
Not helping, Nina.

97
00:04:41,314 --> 00:04:42,353
I'm totally in.

98
00:04:42,355 --> 00:04:43,695
You're totally not invited.

99
00:04:43,697 --> 00:04:44,639
Cass.

100
00:04:45,054 --> 00:04:46,609
Fine,
Blaire is invited.

101
00:04:46,611 --> 00:04:47,304
So you're in?

102
00:04:47,306 --> 00:04:48,221
I didn't say that.

103
00:04:48,223 --> 00:04:49,546
I can go.

104
00:04:49,548 --> 00:04:50,746
Still not helping, Nina.

105
00:04:50,748 --> 00:04:52,290
You would sneak out of your house?

106
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,337
I would for research.

107
00:04:53,339 --> 00:04:54,681
And I could stream the whole thing.

108
00:04:54,683 --> 00:04:56,174
You're missing the point, Blaire.

109
00:04:56,176 --> 00:04:57,291
There's no point.

110
00:04:57,293 --> 00:05:00,617
It's not worth getting caught,
or kidnapped.

111
00:05:00,725 --> 00:05:02,225
Or worse.

112
00:05:02,875 --> 00:05:04,616
What's worse than being kidnapped?

113
00:05:04,618 --> 00:05:06,259
Have you seen Saw?

114
00:05:06,292 --> 00:05:07,691
No, I never saw that.

115
00:05:07,693 --> 00:05:09,775
If you'd seen Saw, you'd know.

116
00:05:10,292 --> 00:05:12,195
Have an adventure, Mads.

117
00:05:12,197 --> 00:05:14,195
There are crazy people out there.

118
00:05:14,197 --> 00:05:15,638
Well, I have pepper spray.

119
00:05:15,640 --> 00:05:17,424
Blaire, put that away.

120
00:05:17,426 --> 00:05:17,882
See?

121
00:05:17,884 --> 00:05:19,283
We're protected.

122
00:05:19,611 --> 00:05:22,540
We'll go somewhere safe
and be back before anyone notices.

123
00:05:22,542 --> 00:05:23,733
What about your parents?

124
00:05:23,735 --> 00:05:25,123
They'll be closing the bar.

125
00:05:25,125 --> 00:05:27,390
By the time they get home,
they'll just assume I'm asleep.

126
00:05:27,392 --> 00:05:29,416
And I'll say I'm sleeping over at Nina's.

127
00:05:29,418 --> 00:05:30,691
It's a school night.

128
00:05:30,693 --> 00:05:33,917
Then I'll just sneak out
after my mom goes asleep.

129
00:05:33,925 --> 00:05:35,310
It's not that difficult.

130
00:05:35,312 --> 00:05:37,025
Have you done this before?

131
00:05:37,225 --> 00:05:39,967
Of course not,
I'm not a delinquent.

132
00:05:40,292 --> 00:05:42,108
I don't know about this, Cass.

133
00:05:43,011 --> 00:05:44,350
Baker hesitates.

134
00:05:44,352 --> 00:05:45,910
Will she, or won't she?

135
00:05:45,912 --> 00:05:47,324
Subscribe to find out.

136
00:05:47,326 --> 00:05:48,510
By this time tomorrow,

137
00:05:48,512 --> 00:05:51,048
you'll be unpacking a carry-on in Kansas.

138
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:53,566
Do you really want to spend
your last night in California

139
00:05:53,568 --> 00:05:54,975
tucked in bed reading?

140
00:05:55,183 --> 00:05:56,707
I like reading.

141
00:06:00,142 --> 00:06:01,800
Okay, I'm in.

142
00:06:02,182 --> 00:06:04,975
Oh, really?

143
00:06:06,454 --> 00:06:08,611
Dad.

144
00:06:09,258 --> 00:06:11,133
You have an opportunity here.

145
00:06:11,425 --> 00:06:14,254
If you tell on your sister,
you get nothing.

146
00:06:14,733 --> 00:06:18,875
But if you keep your mouth shut,
she owes you something, right?

147
00:06:19,012 --> 00:06:20,525
I guess so.

148
00:06:20,882 --> 00:06:22,854
Isn't there something you want from her?

149
00:06:23,250 --> 00:06:24,267
Oh, no.

150
00:06:24,326 --> 00:06:26,367
Your phone is mine.

151
00:06:26,369 --> 00:06:28,038
You can use it tonight.

152
00:06:28,040 --> 00:06:29,253
Forever.

153
00:06:29,255 --> 00:06:30,953
Not happening.

154
00:06:30,955 --> 00:06:32,211
Dad.

155
00:06:35,096 --> 00:06:37,992
If you can cover for me successfully,

156
00:06:38,467 --> 00:06:40,225
you can keep the phone.

157
00:06:46,692 --> 00:06:48,192
We've got company.

158
00:06:48,811 --> 00:06:50,867
My mom made me come say goodbye,

159
00:06:50,869 --> 00:06:53,810
so I brought you a present, shortie.

160
00:06:53,812 --> 00:06:56,338
Now you can reach the counters
at your new house.

161
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:58,125
That's very thoughtful.

162
00:06:58,539 --> 00:06:59,895
Thanks, Joslyn.

163
00:06:59,897 --> 00:07:01,581
Tell Barbara I said thank you.

164
00:07:01,583 --> 00:07:04,667
I don't allow you to say my mother's name.

165
00:07:04,669 --> 00:07:05,705
That's odd.

166
00:07:05,725 --> 00:07:08,023
I was pretty sure
your mom's name was Rosemary.

167
00:07:08,025 --> 00:07:10,407
I don't know what that means, smartass,

168
00:07:10,409 --> 00:07:11,495
but I don't like it.

169
00:07:11,497 --> 00:07:14,754
You want another ambulance
to show up at your house, Gordon?

170
00:07:15,596 --> 00:07:19,009
Joslyn, the dog's eating chocolate.

171
00:07:19,011 --> 00:07:21,382
I'll be right there, mom.

172
00:07:22,754 --> 00:07:27,715
Too bad you won't get to see me
as Juliet in the arms of my Romeo.

173
00:07:27,717 --> 00:07:29,166
Maybe at your next school,

174
00:07:29,168 --> 00:07:31,773
you won't have to deal with
actors as talented as me,

175
00:07:31,775 --> 00:07:33,807
and might get a part in the school play.

176
00:07:34,067 --> 00:07:37,933
Even if it's just something small.

177
00:07:38,450 --> 00:07:40,092
You didn't even...

178
00:07:40,908 --> 00:07:42,725
Enjoy, hobbit.

179
00:07:45,883 --> 00:07:48,138
At least Joslyn's not in Wichita.

180
00:07:48,140 --> 00:07:50,125
There's a Joslyn everywhere.

181
00:07:50,292 --> 00:07:52,349
Why didn't you just punch her in the face?

182
00:07:52,351 --> 00:07:53,966
That would be awesome.

183
00:07:53,968 --> 00:07:56,042
Violence doesn't solve anything.

184
00:07:56,117 --> 00:07:58,074
Worked in the American Revolution.

185
00:07:58,076 --> 00:07:59,667
The War of 1812.

186
00:07:59,669 --> 00:08:01,374
Both world wars.

187
00:08:01,376 --> 00:08:02,742
Wonder Woman?

188
00:08:02,750 --> 00:08:04,524
She's just a bully.

189
00:08:04,526 --> 00:08:07,196
Dad says we have to stand up to bullies.

190
00:08:07,739 --> 00:08:09,010
It doesn't matter now.

191
00:08:09,012 --> 00:08:11,075
I never have to see her again.

192
00:08:11,192 --> 00:08:13,525
It's a really nice stool.

193
00:08:15,082 --> 00:08:17,781
Meanwhile, back at the plan
to sneak out.

194
00:08:17,783 --> 00:08:19,139
Where and when?

195
00:09:25,625 --> 00:09:27,082
Seriously, Blaire?

196
00:09:27,625 --> 00:09:30,367
It's a bird call
to let you know that we're here.

197
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:31,910
No bird sounds like that.

198
00:09:31,912 --> 00:09:34,624
Well, maybe it was an exotic bird.

199
00:09:34,626 --> 00:09:36,025
In this park?

200
00:09:36,200 --> 00:09:37,800
There's a pet store in Bidwell.

201
00:09:40,692 --> 00:09:42,658
They sell exotic birds.

202
00:09:44,617 --> 00:09:47,041
Was that your mating call, Blaire?

203
00:09:47,043 --> 00:09:49,267
What does this sound like to you?

204
00:09:50,696 --> 00:09:52,868
Would you stop that please?

205
00:09:53,768 --> 00:09:55,467
What's in the bag, Cass?

206
00:09:55,469 --> 00:09:56,373
Courage.

207
00:09:56,375 --> 00:09:57,425
Shall we?

208
00:10:20,882 --> 00:10:22,853
I have a bad feeling about this.

209
00:10:22,855 --> 00:10:24,596
We snuck out to go to school.

210
00:10:24,782 --> 00:10:27,180
That bad feeling is called disappointment.

211
00:10:27,182 --> 00:10:28,581
Hey, guys, it's Blaire.

212
00:10:28,583 --> 00:10:30,595
On this episode of Where's Blaire,

213
00:10:30,597 --> 00:10:31,738
we are sitting at-

214
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,738
Blaire.

215
00:10:32,740 --> 00:10:33,495
What?

216
00:10:33,497 --> 00:10:35,568
Please keep this off the Internet.

217
00:10:35,896 --> 00:10:37,611
It's for my fans.

218
00:10:38,139 --> 00:10:39,467
It's evidence.

219
00:10:39,469 --> 00:10:40,724
And the last thing I need

220
00:10:40,726 --> 00:10:43,210
is proof of my being here
when I don't have to be.

221
00:10:43,212 --> 00:10:46,681
You just don't understand
the importance of social media.

222
00:10:46,683 --> 00:10:48,853
The one girl in the world without a phone.

223
00:10:48,855 --> 00:10:52,180
Because I hate social and media.

224
00:10:52,182 --> 00:10:53,753
I don't have a phone.

225
00:10:53,755 --> 00:10:55,294
No one would call you.

226
00:10:55,296 --> 00:10:56,724
Who actually calls anyone?

227
00:10:56,726 --> 00:10:59,168
It's a distraction from research.

228
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:02,525
This is the last time
we'll all be here together.

229
00:11:02,954 --> 00:11:04,395
Lucky you.

230
00:11:04,397 --> 00:11:06,338
Why do you hate it here so much?

231
00:11:06,340 --> 00:11:07,938
This place is a prison.

232
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:09,739
You need to make more friends.

233
00:11:10,154 --> 00:11:12,124
I need less friends.

234
00:11:12,126 --> 00:11:13,624
You're very antisocial.

235
00:11:13,626 --> 00:11:14,381
Almost.

236
00:11:14,383 --> 00:11:16,753
She has six of the seven
qualifying subfeatures,

237
00:11:16,755 --> 00:11:18,481
comorbid with substance abuse.

238
00:11:18,483 --> 00:11:20,511
But I've yet to observe that.

239
00:11:20,768 --> 00:11:22,296
That reminds me.

240
00:11:23,168 --> 00:11:24,525
I brought vodka.

241
00:11:27,482 --> 00:11:30,080
Gordon presenting maladaptive behavior.

242
00:11:30,082 --> 00:11:31,481
Maybe I need new friends.

243
00:11:31,483 --> 00:11:33,366
Now you're just being passive-aggressive.

244
00:11:33,368 --> 00:11:34,495
I can drop the passive.

245
00:11:34,497 --> 00:11:37,639
So what kind of vodka is it?

246
00:11:37,954 --> 00:11:41,295
The kind to make you forget
that you ditched home to go to school.

247
00:11:41,297 --> 00:11:43,738
You're not actually going to drink that,
are you?

248
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:44,966
Not alone.

249
00:11:44,968 --> 00:11:46,596
This is so exciting.

250
00:11:47,882 --> 00:11:50,011
Where did you even get this?

251
00:11:50,796 --> 00:11:52,567
My parents own a bar.

252
00:11:52,569 --> 00:11:55,180
There's more bottles in my house
than picture frames.

253
00:11:55,182 --> 00:11:56,938
And you expect us to drink this?

254
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,394
Everyone except Nina.

255
00:11:58,396 --> 00:11:59,982
Fun's not her thing.

256
00:12:00,425 --> 00:12:01,067
Who's first?

257
00:12:01,069 --> 00:12:02,442
Oh, me.

258
00:12:05,208 --> 00:12:07,000
Feels so adult.

259
00:12:26,525 --> 00:12:28,054
Delightful.

260
00:12:29,925 --> 00:12:31,411
It gets easier.

261
00:12:31,811 --> 00:12:32,823
Does it?

262
00:12:32,825 --> 00:12:34,068
So I've heard.

263
00:12:44,611 --> 00:12:45,950
You're up, Mads.

264
00:12:48,033 --> 00:12:49,867
I don't think I should.

265
00:12:50,300 --> 00:12:52,358
Why? Are you driving?

266
00:12:52,811 --> 00:12:54,667
You said hang out.

267
00:12:54,669 --> 00:12:56,608
You never mentioned drinking.

268
00:12:57,325 --> 00:12:58,610
Suit yourself.

269
00:12:58,612 --> 00:12:59,750
More for me.

270
00:13:05,068 --> 00:13:05,924
Truth or death?

271
00:13:05,926 --> 00:13:06,853
I'll go.

272
00:13:06,855 --> 00:13:09,282
That was my first drink of vodka.

273
00:13:09,525 --> 00:13:10,567
Ever.

274
00:13:11,025 --> 00:13:12,211
Revelation.

275
00:13:14,282 --> 00:13:16,754
Have something you'd like to share, Cass?

276
00:13:17,025 --> 00:13:18,781
That's why I brought it.

277
00:13:18,783 --> 00:13:19,981
Try it, Madison.

278
00:13:19,983 --> 00:13:21,924
The buzz is amazing.

279
00:13:21,926 --> 00:13:24,008
You took one sip, Blaire.

280
00:13:24,125 --> 00:13:27,052
If your blood alcohol level
is over 0.08 percent,

281
00:13:27,054 --> 00:13:28,895
you're considered legally inebriated.

282
00:13:28,897 --> 00:13:30,910
So depending on
what she's eaten recently

283
00:13:30,912 --> 00:13:32,352
and factoring Blair's petite-

284
00:13:32,354 --> 00:13:33,596
Shut up, Nina.

285
00:13:34,539 --> 00:13:35,065
See?

286
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:36,622
That wasn't passive at all.

287
00:13:36,624 --> 00:13:38,639
I can handle it, Nina Pearl.

288
00:13:44,592 --> 00:13:46,958
Your middle name is Pearl?

289
00:13:48,311 --> 00:13:50,982
Why, was Eunice already taken?

290
00:13:51,268 --> 00:13:53,581
Drink up, Mildred's not looking.

291
00:13:53,583 --> 00:13:56,524
Would it kill you to be
a little nicer to her?

292
00:13:56,526 --> 00:13:59,066
I don't know, but I'm not
really willing to risk it.

293
00:13:59,068 --> 00:14:01,054
What's really bothering you?

294
00:14:02,025 --> 00:14:03,394
This campus?

295
00:14:03,396 --> 00:14:05,266
What's so bad about school?

296
00:14:05,268 --> 00:14:06,524
Oh, let me see.

297
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:09,138
The mental incarceration.

298
00:14:09,140 --> 00:14:10,723
Pretentious lecturing.

299
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:13,110
Ostentatious social theater.

300
00:14:13,112 --> 00:14:17,410
You have an expansive vocabulary
for someone who hates school so much.

301
00:14:17,412 --> 00:14:18,811
I read a lot.

302
00:14:22,325 --> 00:14:23,337
Drink.

303
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:24,322
Be merry.

304
00:14:24,324 --> 00:14:26,868
For tomorrow,
you're a Kansan.

305
00:14:53,125 --> 00:14:55,768
Why would anyone ever drink that?

306
00:14:57,111 --> 00:14:58,238
Have more.

307
00:14:58,240 --> 00:14:59,496
You'll find out.

308
00:14:59,783 --> 00:15:01,583
I'm good for now.

309
00:15:08,092 --> 00:15:09,483
Truth or death?

310
00:15:09,996 --> 00:15:11,782
I believe it's your turn.

311
00:15:13,782 --> 00:15:15,439
Do you have any regrets?

312
00:15:22,182 --> 00:15:23,822
I should have done more.

313
00:15:23,824 --> 00:15:25,396
More what?

314
00:15:25,782 --> 00:15:28,681
Anything I wanted but was afraid to try.

315
00:15:28,683 --> 00:15:30,795
Volleyball, spirit club.

316
00:15:30,797 --> 00:15:31,796
Nauseating.

317
00:15:32,568 --> 00:15:35,038
Something that would
define my existence here.

318
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:39,453
I don't think you're supposed
to define your existence by age 14.

319
00:15:39,455 --> 00:15:42,967
Well, Dakota Fanning was nominated
for a SAG award when she was eight.

320
00:15:42,969 --> 00:15:44,067
That's another thing.

321
00:15:44,069 --> 00:15:45,881
I finally try out for drama-

322
00:15:45,883 --> 00:15:47,925
And Joslyn got the lead.

323
00:15:48,411 --> 00:15:52,282
She has the nerve to rub it in your face
every chance she gets.

324
00:15:56,739 --> 00:15:58,711
This is a blast.

325
00:16:02,625 --> 00:16:04,468
There's something else.

326
00:16:04,796 --> 00:16:06,096
Well, tell.

327
00:16:06,568 --> 00:16:07,882
We're all waiting.

328
00:16:08,425 --> 00:16:09,524
It's stupid.

329
00:16:09,526 --> 00:16:10,823
Even better.

330
00:16:10,825 --> 00:16:12,881
Can't be more stupid than spirit club.

331
00:16:12,883 --> 00:16:14,096
Forget it.

332
00:16:14,525 --> 00:16:15,567
Sorry, Mads.

333
00:16:15,569 --> 00:16:16,924
You opened this door.

334
00:16:16,926 --> 00:16:18,853
You have to walk through it.

335
00:16:18,855 --> 00:16:20,996
It's not called truth or never mind.

336
00:16:21,539 --> 00:16:23,325
Put the phone away, Blaire.

337
00:16:39,268 --> 00:16:41,510
I have a crush on Ryan Bright.

338
00:16:41,512 --> 00:16:43,311
This is news.

339
00:16:43,468 --> 00:16:46,011
It never leaves this table,
got it?

340
00:16:46,125 --> 00:16:49,037
You sure waited until the last minute
to make this a thing.

341
00:16:49,039 --> 00:16:51,081
I've never had the nerve to say it.

342
00:16:51,083 --> 00:16:52,624
He doesn't even know I'm alive.

343
00:16:52,626 --> 00:16:54,324
Well, he's Romeo in the play.

344
00:16:54,326 --> 00:16:57,039
Surely you saw each other at auditions.

345
00:16:59,468 --> 00:17:00,796
I saw him.

346
00:17:04,025 --> 00:17:05,837
why didn't you just tell him?

347
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:07,324
Because I'm a girl.

348
00:17:07,326 --> 00:17:08,837
We don't just tell them.

349
00:17:08,839 --> 00:17:12,468
We smile in their direction
and expect them to get the hint.

350
00:17:12,896 --> 00:17:14,638
And how'd that work out for you?

351
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,025
Well, text him.

352
00:17:16,211 --> 00:17:17,824
Don't have a phone, Blaire.

353
00:17:17,826 --> 00:17:18,954
Use my phone.

354
00:17:19,454 --> 00:17:20,209
Wait.

355
00:17:20,211 --> 00:17:22,567
Guys, I know where Ryan Bright lives.

356
00:17:22,569 --> 00:17:24,410
Let's go to his house right now.

357
00:17:24,412 --> 00:17:25,781
Profess your love.

358
00:17:26,325 --> 00:17:28,595
Yeah, and then Wichita
will be far enough away

359
00:17:28,597 --> 00:17:30,439
to honor the restraining order.

360
00:17:31,125 --> 00:17:33,125
Absolutely not happening.

361
00:17:33,396 --> 00:17:35,910
But this is your chance.

362
00:17:35,912 --> 00:17:38,138
Besides, what's the worst that can happen?

363
00:17:38,140 --> 00:17:42,049
It's not like you have to show up tomorrow
and be the laughing stock of the school.

364
00:17:42,051 --> 00:17:43,308
That's not encouraging.

365
00:17:43,711 --> 00:17:45,510
I think we should stay right here.

366
00:17:45,512 --> 00:17:46,711
Right, Nina?

367
00:17:49,650 --> 00:17:51,067
Nina, are you okay?

368
00:17:54,254 --> 00:17:58,925
My alcohol blood level
is over 0.08 percent.

369
00:18:02,192 --> 00:18:04,058
You drank the rest?

370
00:18:04,554 --> 00:18:05,738
Research.

371
00:18:05,740 --> 00:18:07,754
You pushed her to this, Cassie.

372
00:18:08,254 --> 00:18:10,167
I have nothing to do with this.

373
00:18:10,169 --> 00:18:12,139
She's trying to fit in with you.

374
00:18:12,854 --> 00:18:15,338
Weren't we discussing your love
for Ryan Bright?

375
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:16,810
We must go to his house.

376
00:18:16,812 --> 00:18:17,681
Whose house?

377
00:18:17,683 --> 00:18:19,153
Ryan Bright.

378
00:18:19,155 --> 00:18:20,838
We're at Ryan Bright's house?

379
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:22,667
No, we're not at Ryan Bright's house.

380
00:18:22,669 --> 00:18:25,096
And no, we're not going
to Ryan Bright's house.

381
00:18:25,411 --> 00:18:28,353
We can't go anywhere with Nina like this.

382
00:18:28,355 --> 00:18:29,567
But you love him.

383
00:18:29,569 --> 00:18:30,624
She loves who?

384
00:18:30,626 --> 00:18:32,095
Ryan Bright.

385
00:18:32,097 --> 00:18:33,623
Oh.

386
00:18:33,625 --> 00:18:35,124
Oh, that's good,

387
00:18:35,126 --> 00:18:37,667
because he really likes you.

388
00:18:37,669 --> 00:18:38,753
How do you know this?

389
00:18:38,755 --> 00:18:40,667
She's drunk,
she doesn't know anything.

390
00:18:40,669 --> 00:18:43,366
But seriously, Nina, how do you know this?

391
00:18:43,368 --> 00:18:46,053
We have Chemistry together.

392
00:18:46,055 --> 00:18:48,808
He thinks you're so cute.

393
00:18:48,925 --> 00:18:50,767
And you never told her about this?

394
00:18:50,769 --> 00:18:53,624
I'm an observer, not a catalyst.

395
00:18:53,626 --> 00:18:54,724
Well, I'm a catalyst.

396
00:18:54,726 --> 00:18:55,667
Let's catalyst.

397
00:18:55,669 --> 00:18:56,167
Okay.

398
00:18:56,169 --> 00:18:58,825
We can't catalyst with Slurs-A-Lot.

399
00:18:59,054 --> 00:19:00,524
I'll get us a ride.

400
00:19:00,526 --> 00:19:02,952
What would I even do
if I got to his house?

401
00:19:02,954 --> 00:19:04,424
Serenade him?

402
00:19:04,426 --> 00:19:06,339
How romantic.

403
00:19:07,054 --> 00:19:08,824
It'll be just like Romeo and Juliet,

404
00:19:08,826 --> 00:19:10,411
with less suicide.

405
00:19:12,354 --> 00:19:15,267
Well, DM, FaceTime, like his photos.

406
00:19:15,269 --> 00:19:17,668
Oh, tell him to subscribe
to Where's Blaire.

407
00:19:17,996 --> 00:19:21,253
It doesn't make a difference
if I'm leaving in a matter of hours.

408
00:19:21,255 --> 00:19:24,968
I had all this time, and I never made
a difference to anyone or anything.

409
00:19:28,239 --> 00:19:30,154
Would you regret not trying?

410
00:19:34,882 --> 00:19:36,682
I really need to burp.

411
00:19:37,011 --> 00:19:37,638
Ew.

412
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,911
Don't use that line in your serenade.

413
00:19:41,268 --> 00:19:43,553
Might as well have been
a ghost in this place.

414
00:19:43,555 --> 00:19:45,467
Well, we can change that tonight, Mads.

415
00:19:45,469 --> 00:19:47,024
There's a car on the way.

416
00:19:47,026 --> 00:19:48,111
Let her go.

417
00:19:48,325 --> 00:19:50,024
Bye, Madison.

418
00:19:50,026 --> 00:19:52,738
Have a good-looking Wichita.

419
00:19:52,740 --> 00:19:55,153
She's not going
to Wichita right now, Nina.

420
00:19:55,155 --> 00:19:57,081
Oh, we're going to Wichita?

421
00:19:57,083 --> 00:19:58,180
God, no.

422
00:19:58,182 --> 00:20:00,053
We didn't do anything wrong.

423
00:20:54,382 --> 00:20:56,039
This is all your fault.

424
00:20:56,225 --> 00:20:58,095
I'm not responsible for Nina.

425
00:20:58,097 --> 00:21:00,911
You have a bigger impact on people
than you think.

426
00:21:01,339 --> 00:21:04,154
Go tell it to all your fans, Blaire.

427
00:21:04,239 --> 00:21:06,981
Well, then you tell Madison
that this is her last chance

428
00:21:06,983 --> 00:21:09,296
to do anything she wants in this town.

429
00:21:30,268 --> 00:21:32,038
She won't risk getting in trouble.

430
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:34,253
Nothing's getting Madison
off of this campus.

431
00:21:34,255 --> 00:21:36,168
Well, then we have to convince her.

432
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:12,694
Where's that ride?

433
00:22:12,696 --> 00:22:14,123
I guess she's convinced.

434
00:22:14,125 --> 00:22:15,174
The police are here.

435
00:22:15,176 --> 00:22:16,395
We have to go now.

436
00:22:16,397 --> 00:22:17,934
I don't want to go to prison.

437
00:22:17,936 --> 00:22:20,267
Orange can't be my new black.

438
00:22:20,269 --> 00:22:21,839
Come on, Blaire.

439
00:22:28,225 --> 00:22:30,867
Just stay down.

440
00:22:31,026 --> 00:22:32,854
You're so difficult.

441
00:22:33,054 --> 00:22:34,668
Oh, look at this.

442
00:22:35,054 --> 00:22:36,554
That must be it.

443
00:22:39,325 --> 00:22:40,510
You need a ride?

444
00:22:40,512 --> 00:22:41,639
Yes.

445
00:22:42,782 --> 00:22:43,938
Where are you headed?

446
00:22:43,940 --> 00:22:44,824
Away from here.

447
00:22:44,826 --> 00:22:45,825
Quickly.

448
00:22:46,082 --> 00:22:47,224
Are you in trouble?

449
00:22:47,226 --> 00:22:48,839
Not if you start driving.

450
00:22:49,196 --> 00:22:50,668
Got it.

451
00:23:29,468 --> 00:23:30,754
Turn here.

452
00:23:31,939 --> 00:23:33,854
Party is over, I guess.

453
00:23:41,339 --> 00:23:42,653
Back to your house?

454
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:43,681
Really?

455
00:23:43,683 --> 00:23:48,210
Madison is moving to Wichita.

456
00:23:48,212 --> 00:23:49,867
Nina needs to get home.

457
00:23:49,869 --> 00:23:51,296
We've had our fun.

458
00:23:52,711 --> 00:23:54,738
But the night just started.

459
00:23:54,740 --> 00:23:56,995
There's a clearly defined mission.

460
00:23:56,997 --> 00:23:58,481
We can't just quit now.

461
00:23:58,483 --> 00:23:59,768
It's this one.

462
00:24:06,354 --> 00:24:10,753
We just let this nice man drive us over
to Ryan's house for a few minutes,

463
00:24:10,755 --> 00:24:12,495
and then we come right back.

464
00:24:12,497 --> 00:24:14,194
Twenty more minutes, max.

465
00:24:14,196 --> 00:24:16,682
Less if he slams the door in your face.

466
00:24:17,911 --> 00:24:19,139
Otis.

467
00:24:19,454 --> 00:24:20,953
What's an Otis?

468
00:24:20,955 --> 00:24:22,539
That's my name.

469
00:24:22,854 --> 00:24:23,981
Otis.

470
00:24:23,983 --> 00:24:27,082
The man who is being very patient.

471
00:24:27,882 --> 00:24:29,811
Otis is waiting, Mads.

472
00:24:48,239 --> 00:24:50,067
Don't go in, Madison.

473
00:24:50,069 --> 00:24:54,539
Madison is moving to Wichita.

474
00:24:57,054 --> 00:24:58,554
What is it, dad?

475
00:25:00,639 --> 00:25:03,082
Is that your dad staring at me?

476
00:25:07,168 --> 00:25:08,925
Now or never, Baker.

477
00:25:09,411 --> 00:25:10,611
Make a choice.

478
00:25:24,267 --> 00:25:26,417
Maybe it's someone who saw the listing.

479
00:25:38,882 --> 00:25:40,425
What's that smell?

480
00:25:41,025 --> 00:25:42,095
Probably Nina.

481
00:25:42,097 --> 00:25:43,054
Here.

482
00:25:48,811 --> 00:25:50,253
That's Bernice.

483
00:25:50,255 --> 00:25:52,525
Say hello to Bernice, Blaire.

484
00:25:52,896 --> 00:25:54,395
Does it live in here?

485
00:25:54,397 --> 00:25:55,724
Of course not.

486
00:25:55,726 --> 00:25:57,767
She just sleeps better when I'm driving.

487
00:25:57,769 --> 00:26:00,053
Does it poop in here?

488
00:26:00,055 --> 00:26:01,823
Maybe that's the smell?

489
00:26:01,825 --> 00:26:04,768
Only if chicken poop smells
like body odor and whiskey.

490
00:26:05,496 --> 00:26:08,781
How do you know what body odor
and whiskey smells like?

491
00:26:08,783 --> 00:26:09,538
My parents-

492
00:26:09,540 --> 00:26:10,811
Own a bar.

493
00:26:11,125 --> 00:26:12,283
Own a bar.

494
00:26:24,868 --> 00:26:25,790
Hey, man.

495
00:26:25,792 --> 00:26:27,596
I was just about to head your way.

496
00:26:28,225 --> 00:26:30,139
Yeah, for sure.

497
00:26:30,254 --> 00:26:32,639
I got four fresh ones for you.

498
00:26:38,382 --> 00:26:39,995
They're in good condition.

499
00:26:39,997 --> 00:26:41,582
One's a little messed up.

500
00:26:42,096 --> 00:26:43,253
But they'll be tasty,

501
00:26:43,255 --> 00:26:44,895
that is for sure.

502
00:26:44,897 --> 00:26:48,453
Was this a highly rated
kidnapping service, Blaire?

503
00:26:48,455 --> 00:26:50,654
Did he say tasty?

504
00:26:54,154 --> 00:26:55,110
I've got a plan.

505
00:26:55,112 --> 00:26:56,482
Nina, wake up.

506
00:26:57,308 --> 00:26:58,524
Stop the truck.

507
00:26:58,526 --> 00:27:00,182
My friend has to puke.

508
00:27:00,933 --> 00:27:02,350
I'll call you back.

509
00:27:14,508 --> 00:27:15,324
Come on, Nina.

510
00:27:15,326 --> 00:27:16,325
Go.

511
00:27:31,839 --> 00:27:34,568
I can't run anymore.

512
00:27:35,868 --> 00:27:37,195
Have an adventure, Mads.

513
00:27:37,197 --> 00:27:39,066
This isn't exactly what I had in mind.

514
00:27:39,068 --> 00:27:42,096
Do you guys realize
the danger I was just in?

515
00:27:42,696 --> 00:27:43,938
We were there too.

516
00:27:43,940 --> 00:27:45,138
But I'm the prettiest.

517
00:27:45,140 --> 00:27:47,525
I was clearly in the most danger.

518
00:27:47,782 --> 00:27:51,138
This is exactly why there are
rules and curfews and parents.

519
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:52,324
I'll get us another guy.

520
00:27:52,326 --> 00:27:53,581
No more rides.

521
00:27:53,583 --> 00:27:55,238
So we walk to Ryan's house.

522
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:56,782
Are we in Slovakia?

523
00:27:56,784 --> 00:28:00,415
It says that we can follow the bike trail
straight through to his neighborhood.

524
00:28:00,417 --> 00:28:03,382
Which would take us forever
and we'd still have to get home.

525
00:28:03,384 --> 00:28:04,957
Well, your home is in Wichita.

526
00:28:04,959 --> 00:28:08,925
Madison is going to Wichita.

527
00:28:10,739 --> 00:28:12,638
Shouldn't we at least get Nina home?

528
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,153
Don't turn back now.

529
00:28:14,155 --> 00:28:15,995
Make your dreams come true.

530
00:28:15,997 --> 00:28:17,467
Do it for your heart.

531
00:28:17,469 --> 00:28:18,981
Do it for us.

532
00:28:18,983 --> 00:28:20,667
Do it for the views.

533
00:28:20,669 --> 00:28:21,738
Hey, guys.

534
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:22,853
Where's Blaire?

535
00:28:22,855 --> 00:28:24,139
Look for yourself.

536
00:28:27,068 --> 00:28:28,154
Look.

537
00:28:28,482 --> 00:28:29,854
I know it's late.

538
00:28:30,582 --> 00:28:31,910
I know you're weary.

539
00:28:31,912 --> 00:28:33,511
That's Bob Seger.

540
00:28:34,296 --> 00:28:37,068
Yes, but it's also exceptionally relevant.

541
00:28:37,075 --> 00:28:39,233
You're having the night of your life.

542
00:28:39,939 --> 00:28:41,468
Nina's having a great time.

543
00:28:58,525 --> 00:28:59,896
whoopsie-daisy.

544
00:29:02,325 --> 00:29:03,639
Nina.

545
00:29:05,811 --> 00:29:07,753
I so totally got that.

546
00:29:07,755 --> 00:29:09,153
I think that helped.

547
00:29:09,155 --> 00:29:10,863
Cassie, look at this.

548
00:29:10,865 --> 00:29:11,910
That's so gross.

549
00:29:11,912 --> 00:29:14,454
I feel like I just gave birth
out of my mouth.

550
00:29:16,011 --> 00:29:17,039
So gross.

551
00:29:21,611 --> 00:29:22,538
Don't freak out.

552
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:23,967
He's going to kill us.

553
00:29:23,969 --> 00:29:25,767
Real low-key, Blaire.

554
00:29:25,769 --> 00:29:29,025
A little late to be out for a stroll.

555
00:29:29,939 --> 00:29:30,968
Innit

556
00:29:33,139 --> 00:29:34,824
We were just heading back.

557
00:29:34,826 --> 00:29:37,353
Madison has a crush.

558
00:29:37,355 --> 00:29:39,208
Madison.

559
00:29:41,154 --> 00:29:43,223
We'll be right there, dad.

560
00:29:43,225 --> 00:29:45,208
I thought your dad was at work.

561
00:29:46,739 --> 00:29:48,511
Pretty little girls

562
00:29:49,108 --> 00:29:50,683
all alone,

563
00:29:50,983 --> 00:29:52,074
out at night.

564
00:29:52,076 --> 00:29:53,057
She's the prettiest.

565
00:29:53,059 --> 00:29:53,724
No, I'm not.

566
00:29:53,726 --> 00:29:58,883
And she's going to tell her love
that she crushes him.

567
00:30:00,868 --> 00:30:05,405
We should make them
be our friends, huh?

568
00:30:12,568 --> 00:30:15,325
He can't hurt us if we all stick together.

569
00:30:21,325 --> 00:30:22,823
Blaire ran?

570
00:30:22,825 --> 00:30:23,882
Yup.

571
00:30:28,982 --> 00:30:29,982
No.

572
00:30:30,139 --> 00:30:31,039
Bye.

573
00:30:44,382 --> 00:30:46,225
Do you have permission to use that?

574
00:30:46,539 --> 00:30:47,881
Madison knows.

575
00:30:47,883 --> 00:30:49,291
Well, I need to talk to you both.

576
00:30:49,293 --> 00:30:50,942
Can you have her come downstairs?

577
00:30:51,233 --> 00:30:52,975
She's in the shower.

578
00:30:54,311 --> 00:30:55,739
I don't hear the water.

579
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:58,187
She's getting in the shower.

580
00:30:58,358 --> 00:30:58,991
All right.

581
00:30:58,993 --> 00:31:00,184
Well, when she's done.

582
00:31:00,440 --> 00:31:01,124
Okay?

583
00:31:01,126 --> 00:31:02,896
Sure thing, dad.

584
00:31:12,083 --> 00:31:14,825
Well, it felt like I had to do something.

585
00:31:15,082 --> 00:31:18,637
Tagging the wall with your name
is definitely something, Banksy.

586
00:31:18,639 --> 00:31:21,906
It looks like from the pond,
we follow Scottsdale to Woodridge,

587
00:31:21,908 --> 00:31:24,381
and then Ryan's house
is just up the hill from there.

588
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,907
That'll take us at least another hour.

589
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:29,767
What was that?

590
00:31:30,633 --> 00:31:32,758
Maybe an exotic bird.

591
00:31:33,600 --> 00:31:35,525
You're going to take off running?

592
00:31:36,439 --> 00:31:38,667
It was a fight or flight instinct.

593
00:31:38,669 --> 00:31:40,254
I saved your life.

594
00:31:40,482 --> 00:31:42,523
You abandoned us.

595
00:31:42,525 --> 00:31:44,553
Like you're such a team player.

596
00:31:44,555 --> 00:31:46,724
What happened to "I've got pepper spray"?

597
00:31:46,726 --> 00:31:48,581
Where were you on that, Quick Draw?

598
00:31:48,583 --> 00:31:50,868
What does drawing have to do with this?

599
00:31:51,533 --> 00:31:53,608
We should have left her in the truck.

600
00:31:55,475 --> 00:31:58,239
Nina can't walk the entire way.

601
00:32:00,454 --> 00:32:02,140
She can have a seat over here.

602
00:32:02,142 --> 00:32:03,832
We'll pick her up on the way back.

603
00:32:03,834 --> 00:32:06,410
There's a fire in my stomach.

604
00:32:06,412 --> 00:32:07,909
Let her rest for a minute.

605
00:32:07,911 --> 00:32:09,181
Me too.

606
00:32:09,183 --> 00:32:11,310
These two are like speed bumps.

607
00:32:11,312 --> 00:32:13,295
Why are you in such a hurry anyway?

608
00:32:13,297 --> 00:32:15,696
Yeah, sneaking out was your plan.

609
00:32:19,439 --> 00:32:24,266
I just think you shouldn't have to wait
to tell someone how much they mean to you.

610
00:32:24,268 --> 00:32:26,825
So what is it you like about Ryan Bright?

611
00:32:27,354 --> 00:32:28,596
Is it his eyes?

612
00:32:29,108 --> 00:32:30,092
No.

613
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:32,009
I mean, sure.

614
00:32:32,011 --> 00:32:34,525
But it's something else.

615
00:32:34,911 --> 00:32:36,466
It's hard to explain.

616
00:32:36,468 --> 00:32:39,295
Oh, you mean like how his smile
is more of a smolder-

617
00:32:39,297 --> 00:32:40,496
Not that either.

618
00:32:41,654 --> 00:32:43,054
It's like...

619
00:32:43,954 --> 00:32:47,354
Have you ever felt you knew someone
when you really didn't?

620
00:32:47,668 --> 00:32:51,168
Like somewhere, someplace...

621
00:32:51,825 --> 00:32:53,200
You've met.

622
00:32:53,996 --> 00:32:55,824
An inexplicable connection

623
00:32:55,826 --> 00:32:58,125
that doesn't really make any sense.

624
00:32:58,639 --> 00:33:01,068
It just seems so real.

625
00:33:01,725 --> 00:33:03,994
Are you going to make us
read tarot cards now?

626
00:33:03,996 --> 00:33:06,608
Well, what do you think
you're going to say to him?

627
00:33:07,154 --> 00:33:08,539
Practice with us.

628
00:33:09,282 --> 00:33:10,398
Hi, Ryan.

629
00:33:10,442 --> 00:33:11,483
I'm tired.

630
00:33:11,533 --> 00:33:12,542
Scared.

631
00:33:12,654 --> 00:33:14,653
Sad that I'm leaving in the morning.

632
00:33:14,655 --> 00:33:16,824
Just stopping by
in the middle of the night

633
00:33:16,826 --> 00:33:18,525
to let you know that I like you.

634
00:33:18,725 --> 00:33:20,438
Is that Shakespeare?

635
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:22,238
Jane Austen.

636
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:23,495
Is she a sophomore?

637
00:33:23,497 --> 00:33:24,753
I have to throw up.

638
00:33:24,755 --> 00:33:25,853
Need my sweater?

639
00:33:25,855 --> 00:33:27,395
There's a trash can over there.

640
00:33:27,397 --> 00:33:29,182
Come on, Nina.

641
00:33:41,611 --> 00:33:43,768
I guess it's finally just us.

642
00:33:44,539 --> 00:33:45,625
Truth or death?

643
00:34:06,517 --> 00:34:08,742
Do you think you'll really tell him?

644
00:34:11,110 --> 00:34:12,110
I mean,

645
00:34:12,754 --> 00:34:14,454
when it comes down to it,

646
00:34:14,882 --> 00:34:16,425
that moment...

647
00:34:18,225 --> 00:34:21,802
Because you can say it
over and over again in your head,

648
00:34:21,804 --> 00:34:24,166
rehearse the perfect sequence of words.

649
00:34:24,168 --> 00:34:27,011
But when the moment is actually there...

650
00:34:28,668 --> 00:34:30,181
will you do it?

651
00:34:31,210 --> 00:34:33,896
I'll sound stupid, no matter what I say.

652
00:34:35,039 --> 00:34:36,539
Yeah, probably.

653
00:34:37,925 --> 00:34:39,868
But you might never see him again.

654
00:34:42,025 --> 00:34:43,511
So will you tell him?

655
00:34:44,295 --> 00:34:45,954
Even though you'll sound stupid?

656
00:34:47,639 --> 00:34:49,382
What is it, Cass?

657
00:34:55,139 --> 00:34:57,725
Remember when you taught me
how to make pancakes?

658
00:34:58,654 --> 00:35:00,024
On your birthday, sure.

659
00:35:00,026 --> 00:35:03,152
We missed school that day,
because you weren't at the bus stop.

660
00:35:03,154 --> 00:35:04,654
I walked to your house.

661
00:35:07,933 --> 00:35:09,675
I didn't want to go to school.

662
00:35:11,725 --> 00:35:13,611
Your parents weren't home.

663
00:35:19,754 --> 00:35:23,311
The day before, I was at the park.

664
00:35:23,682 --> 00:35:27,811
Me and some other kids were going down
that old metal slide on wax paper.

665
00:35:28,283 --> 00:35:29,849
It was filthy,

666
00:35:29,851 --> 00:35:32,083
covered in sand and dirt.

667
00:35:32,733 --> 00:35:36,217
I'm pretty sure
I did permanent damage to my tailbone.

668
00:35:38,154 --> 00:35:40,696
It was one of those times that you just

669
00:35:41,550 --> 00:35:42,867
feel like a kid.

670
00:35:44,358 --> 00:35:47,042
No worries or cares.

671
00:35:48,825 --> 00:35:50,342
When I got home,

672
00:35:50,442 --> 00:35:52,225
my mom was on the couch.

673
00:35:54,196 --> 00:35:55,511
I said hi,

674
00:35:56,825 --> 00:35:58,511
but she didn't respond.

675
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:02,200
She wasn't dead.

676
00:36:03,111 --> 00:36:04,324
She wasn't asleep.

677
00:36:04,326 --> 00:36:07,082
Just wasn't really there at all.

678
00:36:07,758 --> 00:36:09,475
I don't understand.

679
00:36:11,239 --> 00:36:12,395
Neither did I,

680
00:36:12,397 --> 00:36:17,711
until I saw a bottle of painkillers
spilled over on the coffee table.

681
00:36:19,492 --> 00:36:21,450
I didn't know how many she'd taken.

682
00:36:21,911 --> 00:36:24,911
Hell, I didn't know anything
about them at all.

683
00:36:27,658 --> 00:36:29,200
What did you do?

684
00:36:29,967 --> 00:36:31,407
I said,
"Wow, Mom,

685
00:36:31,409 --> 00:36:34,350
your new
meditation pose is working great."

686
00:36:37,525 --> 00:36:38,682
She just...

687
00:36:38,982 --> 00:36:40,868
She made this sound.

688
00:36:41,068 --> 00:36:42,068
It was...

689
00:36:51,075 --> 00:36:54,850
I have never been more terrified.

690
00:36:56,925 --> 00:36:59,408
I'm the one who had to call 911.

691
00:36:59,642 --> 00:37:01,350
Were they fighting again?

692
00:37:03,475 --> 00:37:05,908
There's still so much about it
that I don't know.

693
00:37:09,168 --> 00:37:12,852
But she's alive now, so...

694
00:37:12,854 --> 00:37:14,068
Right.

695
00:37:14,954 --> 00:37:19,011
An ambulance came to my house
and wheeled her out.

696
00:37:19,025 --> 00:37:22,425
My dad followed,
and he would not let me come with him.

697
00:37:22,982 --> 00:37:24,882
You were pretty young then.

698
00:37:26,311 --> 00:37:27,682
I was 11.

699
00:37:28,468 --> 00:37:31,410
I was old enough to know
if my mother was dying.

700
00:37:31,412 --> 00:37:32,805
Of course.

701
00:37:35,875 --> 00:37:37,383
No one called.

702
00:37:39,308 --> 00:37:44,575
I just sat and waited to find out
if my whole world had fallen apart.

703
00:37:47,511 --> 00:37:48,582
That's...

704
00:37:53,212 --> 00:37:53,867
That's-

705
00:37:53,869 --> 00:37:55,282
It's bullshit.

706
00:38:00,325 --> 00:38:03,595
My dad dropped off
a box of donuts in the morning.

707
00:38:03,597 --> 00:38:05,467
"Happy birthday, Cassie.

708
00:38:05,469 --> 00:38:07,495
Your mom could be dying right now,

709
00:38:07,497 --> 00:38:10,250
and I just didn't have
the time to tell you.

710
00:38:10,426 --> 00:38:12,195
Enjoy a glazed twist."

711
00:38:12,197 --> 00:38:14,696
Why didn't you tell me when I got there?

712
00:38:17,475 --> 00:38:19,142
I was scared,

713
00:38:20,375 --> 00:38:21,575
angry,

714
00:38:22,150 --> 00:38:23,842
so tired.

715
00:38:24,425 --> 00:38:26,417
So we made pancakes.

716
00:38:27,382 --> 00:38:29,482
I just thought you were getting the flu.

717
00:38:33,958 --> 00:38:36,817
You saved me from my crazy.

718
00:38:39,058 --> 00:38:40,658
What about your mom?

719
00:38:42,275 --> 00:38:44,150
She was gone for a week.

720
00:38:44,967 --> 00:38:47,983
My dad told me
she was at the doctor's getting better.

721
00:38:49,454 --> 00:38:53,182
Turns out she was admitted
to a psychiatric hospital for observation.

722
00:38:55,454 --> 00:38:58,525
But she's okay now, so-

723
00:38:59,317 --> 00:39:00,692
but I'm not.

724
00:39:02,111 --> 00:39:03,395
How can you be okay

725
00:39:03,397 --> 00:39:06,411
when you find out
your mom tried to kill herself,

726
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,839
tried to abandon her family?

727
00:39:12,833 --> 00:39:15,258
Your mom didn't have a choice.

728
00:39:16,442 --> 00:39:17,600
Mine did.

729
00:39:20,382 --> 00:39:23,507
I think one of the scariest things
we learn growing up

730
00:39:23,509 --> 00:39:27,308
is that parents are just regular people.

731
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:31,125
They're trying to figure out life
just as much as we are.

732
00:39:32,067 --> 00:39:35,008
Carrying that around with you
probably isn't helping.

733
00:39:39,911 --> 00:39:43,133
It reminds me that people can leave.

734
00:39:45,639 --> 00:39:47,095
They do leave.

735
00:39:47,097 --> 00:39:48,353
Cass.

736
00:39:48,355 --> 00:39:49,311
Sorry.

737
00:39:50,925 --> 00:39:54,868
Look, I'm only telling you this now,
because...

738
00:39:57,882 --> 00:40:00,211
Because you're my best friend.

739
00:40:01,975 --> 00:40:03,917
And you were there for me.

740
00:40:06,933 --> 00:40:09,158
And I wanted you to know that,

741
00:40:09,483 --> 00:40:10,483
before-

742
00:40:11,396 --> 00:40:12,911
Then, hold on to that.

743
00:40:13,550 --> 00:40:14,975
Not this.

744
00:40:19,233 --> 00:40:22,775
Letting go isn't exactly my strong suit.

745
00:40:24,525 --> 00:40:28,968
No matter the distance between us,
I'll always be there for you.

746
00:40:29,608 --> 00:40:34,025
And someday, someone will need you
to make them pancakes.

747
00:40:47,925 --> 00:40:50,767
And that's why you don't
drink and run, kids.

748
00:40:50,769 --> 00:40:51,724
I'm Blaire Beckett.

749
00:40:51,726 --> 00:40:53,065
And if you like this video,

750
00:40:53,067 --> 00:40:54,448
then subscribe to my channel

751
00:40:54,450 --> 00:40:56,795
and catch the next episode
of Where's Blaire,

752
00:40:56,797 --> 00:40:59,782
where Madison Baker
reveals a secret crush.

753
00:41:00,211 --> 00:41:02,083
There's nothing left, just...

754
00:41:03,683 --> 00:41:05,042
Nina, come on.

755
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,296
Get up.

756
00:41:07,982 --> 00:41:09,766
So gross.

757
00:41:09,768 --> 00:41:11,467
You're my best friend.

758
00:41:11,469 --> 00:41:13,182
Where are your glasses?

759
00:41:13,611 --> 00:41:15,525
Do I wear glasses?

760
00:41:17,367 --> 00:41:18,823
Yes, Nina.

761
00:41:18,825 --> 00:41:20,610
When did you last have them?

762
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:23,239
You're shouting.

763
00:41:25,067 --> 00:41:26,638
Oh my God.

764
00:41:26,640 --> 00:41:27,752
Oh my gosh.

765
00:41:27,754 --> 00:41:28,839
Ladies?

766
00:41:29,139 --> 00:41:30,782
We have a problem.

767
00:41:34,639 --> 00:41:36,767
Guys, she lost her glasses.

768
00:41:36,769 --> 00:41:38,982
They must have fallen off in the truck.

769
00:41:39,354 --> 00:41:40,650
I don't know, but...

770
00:41:41,226 --> 00:41:42,267
Great.

771
00:41:42,269 --> 00:41:44,466
Now she's drunk and blind.

772
00:41:44,468 --> 00:41:46,067
Can you see enough to walk?

773
00:41:46,069 --> 00:41:47,854
Everything is dark.

774
00:41:48,742 --> 00:41:52,042
Well, how is she going to explain
losing her glasses?

775
00:41:54,425 --> 00:41:56,166
When did I eat Twizzlers?

776
00:41:56,168 --> 00:42:00,133
I think she's going to have to explain
a little bit more than losing her glasses.

777
00:42:00,135 --> 00:42:01,895
Which means we all get caught.

778
00:42:01,897 --> 00:42:03,167
Well, I won't get caught.

779
00:42:03,169 --> 00:42:05,868
You literally have evidence on your phone.

780
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,117
Yeah, but think of the views.

781
00:42:09,796 --> 00:42:13,168
Will you ever think of anybody
but yourself?

782
00:42:14,682 --> 00:42:15,938
You smell like vomit.

783
00:42:15,940 --> 00:42:16,866
You look like vomit.

784
00:42:16,868 --> 00:42:17,808
Is that...

785
00:42:18,792 --> 00:42:20,208
It can't be.

786
00:42:20,675 --> 00:42:22,680
That's the same truck.

787
00:42:22,682 --> 00:42:26,482
Well, every wine-swigging soccer mom
in town has that truck.

788
00:42:29,117 --> 00:42:30,158
It's him.

789
00:42:31,282 --> 00:42:33,696
Cassie, what is your problem?

790
00:42:37,468 --> 00:42:39,811
Oh my gosh, Cassie,
get out of the street.

791
00:42:42,011 --> 00:42:43,654
Oh my gosh, Cass.

792
00:42:46,217 --> 00:42:48,010
What is your problem?

793
00:42:48,012 --> 00:42:50,068
You have my friend's glasses.

794
00:42:50,854 --> 00:42:53,425
Maybe she dropped them
when you all jumped out.

795
00:42:53,896 --> 00:42:55,967
I have your license plate number.

796
00:42:55,969 --> 00:42:58,495
Give us the glasses or we turn you in.

797
00:42:58,497 --> 00:43:00,437
Turn me in for what?

798
00:43:00,439 --> 00:43:02,254
We heard you, perv.

799
00:43:02,511 --> 00:43:04,195
Four fresh ones?

800
00:43:04,197 --> 00:43:05,754
They'll be tasty?

801
00:43:08,211 --> 00:43:10,325
They will be tasty.

802
00:43:10,696 --> 00:43:14,438
Bernice lays the best eggs.

803
00:43:14,440 --> 00:43:16,725
I give them away to all my friends.

804
00:43:17,954 --> 00:43:18,954
That..

805
00:43:19,568 --> 00:43:20,968
That makes sense.

806
00:43:24,039 --> 00:43:25,582
Get away from her, creep.

807
00:43:25,584 --> 00:43:26,681
No, Blaire.

808
00:43:26,683 --> 00:43:28,349
It's not like that.

809
00:43:28,351 --> 00:43:29,452
You said you heard him.

810
00:43:29,454 --> 00:43:31,739
I know what I heard,
I know what you heard.

811
00:43:32,375 --> 00:43:33,992
Everything's fine.

812
00:43:49,482 --> 00:43:50,638
Good night, dad.

813
00:43:50,640 --> 00:43:51,968
Where's Madison?

814
00:43:53,082 --> 00:43:54,396
Wisconsin.

815
00:43:55,596 --> 00:43:57,625
I really need to talk to you both.

816
00:43:58,725 --> 00:44:01,083
She's not feeling well.

817
00:44:01,811 --> 00:44:03,881
Well, she might feel better after we talk.

818
00:44:03,883 --> 00:44:04,610
No.

819
00:44:04,612 --> 00:44:05,780
You see,

820
00:44:05,782 --> 00:44:09,510
Madison has lady problems.

821
00:44:09,512 --> 00:44:10,354
Oh.

822
00:44:10,925 --> 00:44:12,439
All right, well...

823
00:44:12,925 --> 00:44:13,925
All right.

824
00:44:14,133 --> 00:44:15,749
First thing in the morning then.

825
00:44:15,751 --> 00:44:16,875
First thing.

826
00:44:18,739 --> 00:44:20,025
Okay,
good night.

827
00:44:21,768 --> 00:44:23,338
Why are you sitting there?

828
00:44:23,340 --> 00:44:26,939
If Madison needs anything,
I'm here for her.

829
00:45:08,150 --> 00:45:09,675
I need to apologize.

830
00:45:11,045 --> 00:45:12,354
It's okay.

831
00:45:12,454 --> 00:45:14,796
It's just a misunderstanding.

832
00:45:18,254 --> 00:45:19,137
See?

833
00:45:19,139 --> 00:45:20,638
All is forgiven.

834
00:45:20,640 --> 00:45:22,708
Thank you for welcoming us back.

835
00:45:22,908 --> 00:45:26,296
I'm tolerating you back.

836
00:45:31,342 --> 00:45:33,080
Seriously, though.

837
00:45:33,082 --> 00:45:34,939
Did something die in here?

838
00:45:35,339 --> 00:45:36,524
Not yet.

839
00:45:36,526 --> 00:45:39,039
An air freshener would do wonders.

840
00:45:39,811 --> 00:45:42,382
Same address as before, Otis.

841
00:45:44,467 --> 00:45:46,083
Whatever you say.

842
00:46:31,682 --> 00:46:34,425
What light through yonder window breaks.

843
00:46:36,754 --> 00:46:40,454
It is the East, and Juliet is the sun.

844
00:46:40,568 --> 00:46:42,854
How much of that vodka did you drink?

845
00:46:45,525 --> 00:46:47,681
What are you going to say to Ryan?

846
00:46:47,683 --> 00:46:48,908
I don't know.

847
00:46:48,992 --> 00:46:50,216
"Hi.

848
00:46:50,218 --> 00:46:51,742
Did I wake you?

849
00:46:51,975 --> 00:46:54,642
Sorry I knocked on your door at midnight."

850
00:46:55,025 --> 00:46:56,442
There's a start.

851
00:46:57,054 --> 00:46:58,095
Say nothing.

852
00:46:58,097 --> 00:46:59,181
Just kiss him.

853
00:46:59,183 --> 00:47:00,541
That's a little forward.

854
00:47:00,543 --> 00:47:01,792
For us all.

855
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:04,868
Well, actions speak louder than words.

856
00:47:05,196 --> 00:47:07,195
What if his parents open the door?

857
00:47:07,197 --> 00:47:09,116
What if they won't let me talk to him?

858
00:47:09,118 --> 00:47:10,441
Or worse,

859
00:47:10,443 --> 00:47:12,425
what if he doesn't want to talk to me?

860
00:47:13,282 --> 00:47:15,854
He'd be an idiot not to talk to you.

861
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:17,842
Here's what you do.

862
00:47:18,175 --> 00:47:19,591
Knock on the door.

863
00:47:19,593 --> 00:47:21,916
You apologize for the late visit.

864
00:47:21,918 --> 00:47:23,316
Introduce yourself.

865
00:47:23,318 --> 00:47:25,838
Explain that you're leaving town
in the morning,

866
00:47:25,840 --> 00:47:27,268
and that you didn't want...

867
00:47:28,217 --> 00:47:29,158
What?

868
00:47:32,225 --> 00:47:33,358
What is it?

869
00:47:45,567 --> 00:47:47,410
What was that?

870
00:47:47,412 --> 00:47:49,080
There was an alligator on me.

871
00:47:49,082 --> 00:47:50,467
It wasn't an alligator.

872
00:47:50,469 --> 00:47:52,325
Was it a baby alligator?

873
00:47:54,225 --> 00:47:56,268
Sounds like you met Gus.

874
00:47:56,539 --> 00:47:57,295
Gus?

875
00:47:57,297 --> 00:47:58,325
Gus.

876
00:47:58,425 --> 00:47:59,867
He's my bearded dragon.

877
00:47:59,869 --> 00:48:01,824
Gus is gross.

878
00:48:01,826 --> 00:48:04,196
Gus is great.

879
00:48:04,735 --> 00:48:06,138
He eats crickets.

880
00:48:06,140 --> 00:48:08,181
You have crickets in here, too?

881
00:48:08,183 --> 00:48:10,425
No, of course not.

882
00:48:10,617 --> 00:48:12,508
At least I don't think so.

883
00:48:13,367 --> 00:48:14,833
Probably not.

884
00:48:15,382 --> 00:48:16,794
Relax, Blaire.

885
00:48:16,796 --> 00:48:18,810
The crickets eat the beetles.

886
00:48:18,812 --> 00:48:19,867
I can't do this.

887
00:48:19,869 --> 00:48:22,210
Something is definitely crawling on me.

888
00:48:22,212 --> 00:48:23,266
I have to get out.

889
00:48:23,268 --> 00:48:25,053
We're almost there, calm down.

890
00:48:25,055 --> 00:48:26,295
Oh, calm down?

891
00:48:26,297 --> 00:48:29,982
Are creatures hunting
for other creatures on your body?

892
00:48:30,482 --> 00:48:33,154
Okay, Blaire, would you like me
to film this for you?

893
00:48:34,967 --> 00:48:36,517
Stop the truck.

894
00:48:43,982 --> 00:48:46,225
Get out, Cass.

895
00:48:48,542 --> 00:48:49,542
That's that.

896
00:48:49,658 --> 00:48:50,800
Off we go.

897
00:48:51,696 --> 00:48:53,795
We can't just leave her here.

898
00:48:53,797 --> 00:48:54,996
She'll be fine.

899
00:48:57,882 --> 00:48:59,424
Otis, I'm so sorry.

900
00:48:59,426 --> 00:49:01,550
We're close enough,
we can walk from here.

901
00:49:02,150 --> 00:49:03,156
Good Lord.

902
00:49:03,158 --> 00:49:05,682
You shouldn't be walking around
this late at night.

903
00:49:05,684 --> 00:49:06,757
Do you want me to stay close?

904
00:49:06,759 --> 00:49:09,116
No, I don't want to waste
any more of your time.

905
00:49:09,133 --> 00:49:10,517
How much do we owe you?

906
00:49:10,525 --> 00:49:11,381
Owe me?

907
00:49:11,383 --> 00:49:12,453
Owe me for what?

908
00:49:12,455 --> 00:49:13,723
For the ride.

909
00:49:13,725 --> 00:49:14,809
Rides.

910
00:49:14,811 --> 00:49:15,695
All of it.

911
00:49:15,697 --> 00:49:17,538
Why would I charge you for a ride?

912
00:49:17,540 --> 00:49:18,299
Uber?

913
00:49:18,301 --> 00:49:19,158
Lyft?

914
00:49:19,454 --> 00:49:20,782
Isn't this your job?

915
00:49:21,054 --> 00:49:23,982
I am not an Uber driver.

916
00:49:24,725 --> 00:49:26,509
I own a pet store.

917
00:49:26,511 --> 00:49:29,511
I specialize in exotic birds.

918
00:49:30,125 --> 00:49:31,182
Oh.

919
00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:33,924
I just like driving around at night.

920
00:49:33,926 --> 00:49:36,250
Helps Bernice get her beauty sleep.

921
00:49:36,417 --> 00:49:37,258
But...

922
00:49:37,942 --> 00:49:39,299
I was only at the school

923
00:49:39,301 --> 00:49:42,442
because I like to drop off
a fresh basket of eggs

924
00:49:42,692 --> 00:49:44,425
to Miss Kyle.

925
00:49:45,150 --> 00:49:50,900
Well, then, thanks for your help,
and sorry about the whole thing.

926
00:49:52,111 --> 00:49:52,924
Hey, kid.

927
00:49:52,926 --> 00:49:56,266
Look, I don't know
what I'm going to say to him, okay?

928
00:49:56,268 --> 00:49:58,511
I'm nervous,
but excited.

929
00:49:58,711 --> 00:50:02,141
Have you ever been
on a roller coaster for the first time

930
00:50:02,143 --> 00:50:03,981
and you're climbing slowly

931
00:50:03,983 --> 00:50:07,091
and you know the drop off is coming soon
and you'll be racing around

932
00:50:07,093 --> 00:50:09,324
out of control, not knowing what's next,

933
00:50:09,326 --> 00:50:11,595
not knowing whether
it'll be the best time of your life

934
00:50:11,597 --> 00:50:14,011
or if you're going
to heave a kidney, okay?

935
00:50:14,250 --> 00:50:17,767
I was just going to remind you
to get your friend

936
00:50:17,769 --> 00:50:19,625
and her glasses this time.

937
00:50:47,568 --> 00:50:49,396
I've always loved this view.

938
00:50:49,842 --> 00:50:51,800
Where's the bathroom?

939
00:50:53,308 --> 00:50:55,953
Here, just take her over there
to the bushes.

940
00:50:55,955 --> 00:50:58,838
Well, I'm still processing
the trauma of that Zuber ride.

941
00:50:58,840 --> 00:50:59,996
I'll do it.

942
00:51:00,311 --> 00:51:02,210
No, no, I got it.

943
00:51:02,212 --> 00:51:05,038
Can't risk having Nina's bodily fluids
all over you.

944
00:51:05,040 --> 00:51:06,654
That's disgusting.

945
00:51:07,054 --> 00:51:08,411
Shut up, Blaire.

946
00:51:08,925 --> 00:51:10,910
She's such a bitch.

947
00:51:10,912 --> 00:51:12,200
I heard that.

948
00:51:12,854 --> 00:51:14,238
She's a good person.

949
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:17,282
Well, after you're gone,
I won't have to deal with her at all.

950
00:51:17,639 --> 00:51:19,867
You're both very different people.

951
00:51:19,869 --> 00:51:22,125
But you're both really good friends to me.

952
00:51:23,939 --> 00:51:25,796
I'm going to miss you, Blaire.

953
00:51:27,242 --> 00:51:29,125
I'll miss you too.

954
00:51:29,575 --> 00:51:31,800
You'll still watch
my YouTube channel, right?

955
00:51:33,839 --> 00:51:34,710
Blaire.

956
00:51:34,712 --> 00:51:35,711
What?

957
00:51:36,439 --> 00:51:37,668
Truth or death?

958
00:51:42,111 --> 00:51:43,625
I hate bearded dragons.

959
00:51:45,182 --> 00:51:46,611
Anything else?

960
00:51:47,782 --> 00:51:49,054
Well...

961
00:51:51,682 --> 00:51:53,868
Sometimes I think I'm not the prettiest.

962
00:51:55,982 --> 00:51:57,154
Very humble.

963
00:52:05,196 --> 00:52:06,982
I only have five followers.

964
00:52:08,667 --> 00:52:09,950
We know.

965
00:52:10,754 --> 00:52:13,396
One of them is my grandma.

966
00:52:14,568 --> 00:52:15,511
Yup.

967
00:52:16,296 --> 00:52:21,282
And one of them is a fake account I made
just to like my own videos.

968
00:52:21,692 --> 00:52:23,317
We know that, too.

969
00:52:24,282 --> 00:52:25,282
Well...

970
00:52:26,054 --> 00:52:28,581
Then why doesn't Cassie ever bring it up?

971
00:52:28,583 --> 00:52:31,868
She's angry, but she's not angry at you.

972
00:52:32,439 --> 00:52:35,711
Well, thanks for always liking my videos.

973
00:52:35,968 --> 00:52:37,454
That's what friends do.

974
00:52:37,582 --> 00:52:40,982
But you don't have to post stuff
just to be liked.

975
00:52:41,942 --> 00:52:45,711
I know, but it's how I fit in.

976
00:52:47,554 --> 00:52:49,982
Those who fit in don't really stand out.

977
00:52:51,875 --> 00:52:54,267
Oh, my gosh, Madison.

978
00:52:54,269 --> 00:52:56,424
That was incredibly lame.

979
00:52:56,426 --> 00:52:57,210
I know.

980
00:52:57,212 --> 00:52:59,367
I heard it the moment it left my mouth.

981
00:52:59,369 --> 00:53:01,254
Was that your TED Talk?

982
00:53:01,554 --> 00:53:02,938
Thanks, Mom.

983
00:53:02,940 --> 00:53:04,581
I learned something today.

984
00:53:04,583 --> 00:53:06,038
Okay, that's enough.

985
00:53:06,040 --> 00:53:07,325
But you get the point.

986
00:53:08,054 --> 00:53:09,354
You're a good friend, too.

987
00:53:11,454 --> 00:53:13,667
Well, that was the highlight
of my evening.

988
00:53:13,669 --> 00:53:15,091
Thanks for taking care of her.

989
00:53:15,093 --> 00:53:16,350
Shut up, Blaire.

990
00:53:16,439 --> 00:53:17,324
Come on, Nina.

991
00:53:17,326 --> 00:53:18,654
Not much longer.

992
00:53:19,182 --> 00:53:22,667
Hey, guys, guess what Madison
actually said to me.

993
00:53:22,669 --> 00:53:24,496
Let it go, Blaire.

994
00:53:39,811 --> 00:53:43,009
Take him and cut him out in little stars

995
00:53:43,011 --> 00:53:45,600
and he will make
the face of heaven so fine.

996
00:53:45,800 --> 00:53:48,324
That all the world
will be in love with the night

997
00:53:48,326 --> 00:53:50,754
and pay no worship to the garish sun.

998
00:53:51,111 --> 00:53:52,338
Bravo, Baker.

999
00:53:52,340 --> 00:53:54,211
You would've made a perfect Juliet.

1000
00:53:54,496 --> 00:53:55,767
It's up here on the right.

1001
00:53:55,769 --> 00:53:56,954
Three 27.

1002
00:53:57,839 --> 00:53:59,411
Truth or death, Mads.

1003
00:54:04,982 --> 00:54:06,496
This is thy sheath.

1004
00:54:07,111 --> 00:54:10,410
There rust and let me die.

1005
00:54:10,412 --> 00:54:12,339
So death then?

1006
00:54:14,111 --> 00:54:15,311
I got the part.

1007
00:54:16,025 --> 00:54:16,824
Juliet?

1008
00:54:16,826 --> 00:54:18,253
Congratulations.

1009
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:20,439
No, Joslyn got it.

1010
00:54:20,711 --> 00:54:23,166
Mrs. Curtis gave it to me first.

1011
00:54:23,168 --> 00:54:26,081
Right after Dad told me we were moving.

1012
00:54:26,083 --> 00:54:27,525
I couldn't accept.

1013
00:54:28,096 --> 00:54:29,910
So it went to Joslyn.

1014
00:54:29,912 --> 00:54:31,554
And she gloats about it?

1015
00:54:32,996 --> 00:54:34,253
She doesn't know.

1016
00:54:34,255 --> 00:54:36,425
Well, then, why wouldn't you tell her?

1017
00:54:38,775 --> 00:54:39,850
Come on.

1018
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:42,296
Now's your chance to be Juliet.

1019
00:54:47,039 --> 00:54:48,568
I feel terrible.

1020
00:55:05,011 --> 00:55:07,082
This isn't stalkerish at all.

1021
00:55:07,811 --> 00:55:09,781
What if his parents call the police?

1022
00:55:09,783 --> 00:55:12,496
You better knock before someone else
calls the police.

1023
00:55:12,768 --> 00:55:15,724
Hey, guys, on this episode
of Where's Blaire,

1024
00:55:15,726 --> 00:55:16,754
we are at...

1025
00:55:21,250 --> 00:55:24,217
Sometime before you board the plane
would be great.

1026
00:55:58,682 --> 00:55:59,742
Do it again.

1027
00:56:04,482 --> 00:56:05,911
Nothing's happening.

1028
00:56:19,696 --> 00:56:20,695
Uh-oh.

1029
00:56:20,697 --> 00:56:21,611
What?

1030
00:56:22,568 --> 00:56:23,511
Well,

1031
00:56:24,092 --> 00:56:25,517
here's a picture

1032
00:56:26,182 --> 00:56:28,025
of Ryan and his family

1033
00:56:28,358 --> 00:56:29,783
in Colorado.

1034
00:56:31,211 --> 00:56:33,795
Posted two hours ago.

1035
00:56:33,797 --> 00:56:36,138
So you're saying he's not even here?

1036
00:56:36,140 --> 00:56:38,624
His grandma turned 65.

1037
00:56:38,626 --> 00:56:40,068
Look.

1038
00:56:41,375 --> 00:56:42,583
Jeez.

1039
00:56:47,068 --> 00:56:49,538
Maybe they're heavy sleepers.

1040
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:51,324
Could be watching a movie?

1041
00:56:51,326 --> 00:56:52,625
He's not here.

1042
00:56:53,654 --> 00:56:55,068
They're on vacation.

1043
00:56:55,525 --> 00:56:58,367
Maybe they just take a while
to open the-

1044
00:56:58,369 --> 00:56:59,954
I'm sorry, Mads.

1045
00:57:00,354 --> 00:57:01,611
It's over.

1046
00:57:03,817 --> 00:57:07,182
How could it be over?

1047
00:57:07,692 --> 00:57:09,133
I blame Blaire.

1048
00:57:10,582 --> 00:57:12,838
This is your fault.

1049
00:57:12,840 --> 00:57:14,310
Little bit of that, too.

1050
00:57:14,312 --> 00:57:17,468
"Let's sneak out,
profess your love."

1051
00:57:17,650 --> 00:57:20,150
Technically, Blaire said that.

1052
00:57:20,497 --> 00:57:23,525
Did you guys know
that Ryan likes to snowboard?

1053
00:57:24,582 --> 00:57:26,867
You were on your phone all night,

1054
00:57:26,869 --> 00:57:29,811
and you never noticed he wasn't even home?

1055
00:57:30,025 --> 00:57:33,268
Well, I don't actually follow him.

1056
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:35,750
Well, he doesn't follow me.

1057
00:57:36,011 --> 00:57:38,838
Besides, you're the one
with the connection.

1058
00:57:38,840 --> 00:57:40,639
Why didn't you know he was gone?

1059
00:57:41,154 --> 00:57:44,010
This was a bad plan, executed poorly,

1060
00:57:44,012 --> 00:57:47,868
And now it's the middle of the night,
and we're all the way across town with...

1061
00:57:48,511 --> 00:57:49,911
With that.

1062
00:57:52,168 --> 00:57:54,339
Why do I listen to either of you?

1063
00:58:22,717 --> 00:58:24,916
I shouldn't have dragged you along.

1064
00:58:24,918 --> 00:58:26,466
I chose this.

1065
00:58:26,468 --> 00:58:27,850
Peer pressure, Nina.

1066
00:58:29,411 --> 00:58:32,082
I wouldn't have missed it for anything.

1067
00:58:34,496 --> 00:58:35,668
Research?

1068
00:58:36,167 --> 00:58:38,025
Something like that.

1069
00:58:39,525 --> 00:58:42,039
Why do you work so hard
to analyze everyone?

1070
00:58:42,582 --> 00:58:44,182
Aren't we all crazy?

1071
00:58:45,600 --> 00:58:50,058
I think all people can be classified
as something according to the DSM.

1072
00:58:51,639 --> 00:58:55,195
I just try to understand
why people do what they do.

1073
00:58:55,197 --> 00:58:56,239
And?

1074
00:58:58,268 --> 00:58:59,868
Inconclusive.

1075
00:59:00,325 --> 00:59:03,039
Then what's the point of understanding?

1076
00:59:06,758 --> 00:59:07,917
Nina,

1077
00:59:08,339 --> 00:59:10,511
did someone do something to you?

1078
00:59:14,925 --> 00:59:16,475
Do you want to talk about it?

1079
00:59:20,011 --> 00:59:21,639
Have you told anyone?

1080
00:59:29,854 --> 00:59:32,354
Promise me that you will
when you're ready.

1081
00:59:47,025 --> 00:59:47,909
Come on.

1082
00:59:47,911 --> 00:59:49,525
We've got a long walk home.

1083
00:59:51,354 --> 00:59:54,268
This isn't how love stories
are supposed to end.

1084
00:59:55,225 --> 00:59:56,638
It was worse for Juliet.

1085
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:00,082
This is why you should always call first.

1086
01:00:00,554 --> 01:00:01,838
That's it.

1087
01:00:01,840 --> 01:00:03,467
I'm not calling him now.

1088
01:00:03,469 --> 01:00:05,468
But you can send him a video.

1089
01:00:06,739 --> 01:00:07,925
Blaire's right.

1090
01:00:08,911 --> 01:00:10,239
You should do it.

1091
01:00:34,568 --> 01:00:35,696
Hi, Ry...

1092
01:00:40,200 --> 01:00:41,250
Hi, Ry...

1093
01:00:47,468 --> 01:00:48,639
Hi, Ryan.

1094
01:00:49,575 --> 01:00:51,399
My name is Madison.

1095
01:00:51,401 --> 01:00:53,382
We go to school together.

1096
01:00:53,384 --> 01:00:56,792
I mean, not together together,
but together.

1097
01:00:57,117 --> 01:00:58,875
We go to the same school.

1098
01:01:02,654 --> 01:01:03,939
The thing is,

1099
01:01:04,768 --> 01:01:06,425
I've had a crush on you

1100
01:01:07,496 --> 01:01:08,723
for a while.

1101
01:01:08,725 --> 01:01:11,638
But we practically
live in different worlds,

1102
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,054
so why would I have a crush on you?

1103
01:01:14,654 --> 01:01:15,995
I don't know you.

1104
01:01:15,997 --> 01:01:16,953
Not really.

1105
01:01:16,955 --> 01:01:18,052
I mean,

1106
01:01:18,054 --> 01:01:21,695
I know that you're smart
and that you like to play sports.

1107
01:01:21,697 --> 01:01:22,742
And well,

1108
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:24,567
that you like to snowboard.

1109
01:01:24,808 --> 01:01:26,867
Or so I've heard.

1110
01:01:26,869 --> 01:01:28,296
And you don't know me.

1111
01:01:28,782 --> 01:01:33,111
But we can't really get to know each other
because...

1112
01:01:35,867 --> 01:01:38,017
Because I'm leaving in a few hours.

1113
01:01:38,083 --> 01:01:39,567
I'm moving away.

1114
01:01:39,982 --> 01:01:43,654
So I guess this is more
of a goodbye message than anything.

1115
01:01:45,354 --> 01:01:48,258
I guess I just wanted you
to know how I felt,

1116
01:01:48,317 --> 01:01:50,775
to know that someone
felt that way about you.

1117
01:01:53,142 --> 01:01:55,691
It would have been nice
to get to know the real you,

1118
01:01:55,693 --> 01:01:58,700
but that's not the world we live in, so...

1119
01:01:59,911 --> 01:02:02,168
come find me in a different life.

1120
01:02:04,342 --> 01:02:07,394
A glooming peace
this morning with it brings.

1121
01:02:07,396 --> 01:02:10,810
The sun, for sorrow,
will not show his head.

1122
01:02:10,812 --> 01:02:13,954
Go hence, to have more talk
of these sad things.

1123
01:02:14,582 --> 01:02:17,568
Some shall be pardoned
and some shall be punished.

1124
01:02:17,668 --> 01:02:22,439
But never was a story of more woe
than this of Juliet and her Romeo.

1125
01:02:24,275 --> 01:02:25,317
Bye.

1126
01:02:31,525 --> 01:02:33,567
Oh no, no, no.

1127
01:02:33,569 --> 01:02:35,850
No, no, no, shit.

1128
01:03:07,682 --> 01:03:09,324
Still not my fault.

1129
01:03:09,326 --> 01:03:13,238
The toilet clogs all the time
because Paige flushes all the wipes.

1130
01:03:13,240 --> 01:03:16,223
At least you can finally have
separate [inaudible 01:03:14].

1131
01:03:16,225 --> 01:03:18,754
Oh, you can get a custom vanity like mine.

1132
01:03:19,154 --> 01:03:22,023
No one embraces vanity
quite like you, Blaire.

1133
01:03:22,025 --> 01:03:23,367
Well, thank you.

1134
01:03:23,369 --> 01:03:25,682
I can't go on.

1135
01:03:26,025 --> 01:03:26,873
Oh come on.

1136
01:03:26,875 --> 01:03:27,953
Nina, we're almost home.

1137
01:03:27,955 --> 01:03:30,106
No, my head is pounding.

1138
01:03:30,108 --> 01:03:31,310
A break wouldn't hurt.

1139
01:03:31,312 --> 01:03:33,339
Well, if I stop,
I'll pass out.

1140
01:03:36,782 --> 01:03:38,168
Sun's coming up soon.

1141
01:03:39,008 --> 01:03:41,196
Let's watch the stars
for a little while.

1142
01:03:41,711 --> 01:03:44,625
Well, some of us
still have to go to school today.

1143
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:52,225
I think Nina might have
to take her first absence.

1144
01:03:56,311 --> 01:03:57,554
Truth or death?

1145
01:04:02,754 --> 01:04:03,739
I'll start.

1146
01:04:04,654 --> 01:04:08,025
I think Nina is the prettiest.

1147
01:04:09,296 --> 01:04:10,868
She's gorgeous.

1148
01:04:11,354 --> 01:04:13,911
Even when she's hiding
behind all those books.

1149
01:04:14,754 --> 01:04:16,539
Nina, truth or death?

1150
01:04:22,875 --> 01:04:26,682
I don't really need my glasses.

1151
01:04:27,068 --> 01:04:27,491
But-

1152
01:04:27,493 --> 01:04:29,150
They're not prescription.

1153
01:04:30,092 --> 01:04:31,933
I can see just fine.

1154
01:04:34,211 --> 01:04:35,267
You mean I just-

1155
01:04:35,269 --> 01:04:37,525
She mean she hides her beauty.

1156
01:04:44,967 --> 01:04:47,083
Cassie, truth or death?

1157
01:04:48,011 --> 01:04:50,211
Anything you'd like to tell your friends?

1158
01:04:52,968 --> 01:04:53,982
I'll pass.

1159
01:04:54,596 --> 01:04:56,996
Well, then you have to die.

1160
01:04:57,368 --> 01:05:00,225
So, sitting here with you?

1161
01:05:00,354 --> 01:05:01,668
This is hell?

1162
01:05:02,482 --> 01:05:03,796
Fine then.

1163
01:05:04,411 --> 01:05:06,637
Mads, your turn.

1164
01:05:06,639 --> 01:05:07,896
Truth or death?

1165
01:05:12,300 --> 01:05:14,441
I think after tonight,

1166
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:16,067
I'm okay with moving.

1167
01:05:16,896 --> 01:05:18,667
Because you can sleep on the plane?

1168
01:05:18,669 --> 01:05:21,282
Because I won't have to deal
with the consequences.

1169
01:05:22,354 --> 01:05:24,139
I don't know about that one.

1170
01:05:25,239 --> 01:05:28,082
The universe has a funny way
of catching up to us.

1171
01:05:29,025 --> 01:05:31,996
Speaking of catching up,
we should probably go.

1172
01:05:32,411 --> 01:05:34,009
Just a bit longer.

1173
01:05:34,011 --> 01:05:36,168
As long as we're home by six,
we're fine.

1174
01:05:37,311 --> 01:05:39,439
This moment won't last forever.

1175
01:06:04,768 --> 01:06:05,910
Hello?

1176
01:06:05,912 --> 01:06:06,938
Where are you guys?

1177
01:06:06,940 --> 01:06:08,488
It's 6:30.

1178
01:06:08,490 --> 01:06:09,582
Paige.

1179
01:06:09,584 --> 01:06:11,895
Oh, my God.
We fell asleep at the park.

1180
01:06:11,897 --> 01:06:13,266
Are we busted?

1181
01:06:13,268 --> 01:06:15,181
Not yet, but my dad-

1182
01:06:15,183 --> 01:06:16,968
What's going on in there?

1183
01:06:17,550 --> 01:06:19,932
We're getting ready, Dad.

1184
01:06:19,934 --> 01:06:21,574
At the same time?

1185
01:06:21,576 --> 01:06:25,133
Of course, we're sisters
and we love each other.

1186
01:06:27,208 --> 01:06:28,767
I can't keep stalling him.

1187
01:06:28,769 --> 01:06:30,181
He wants to talk to Madison.

1188
01:06:30,183 --> 01:06:31,839
Get here now.

1189
01:06:32,311 --> 01:06:33,942
Nina, get up.

1190
01:06:34,211 --> 01:06:35,853
Madison, Paige called.

1191
01:06:35,855 --> 01:06:37,481
It's 6:30, we have to go.

1192
01:06:37,483 --> 01:06:38,552
What?

1193
01:06:38,554 --> 01:06:39,554
Cassie.

1194
01:06:39,839 --> 01:06:40,909
Towards Bidwell.

1195
01:06:40,911 --> 01:06:41,938
We have to move.

1196
01:06:41,940 --> 01:06:42,710
We have to run.

1197
01:06:42,712 --> 01:06:44,117
I have to pee.

1198
01:06:45,950 --> 01:06:46,933
Hey.

1199
01:06:47,125 --> 01:06:48,650
You have to move too.

1200
01:06:52,268 --> 01:06:56,182
Maybe you should come out and talk with me
before you're finished getting ready.

1201
01:06:56,611 --> 01:06:57,795
Putting on eyeliner.

1202
01:06:57,797 --> 01:06:59,796
You don't interrupt eyeliner.

1203
01:07:00,811 --> 01:07:03,168
Hey, Madison,
how are you feeling this morning?

1204
01:07:06,468 --> 01:07:08,625
I feel great, Dad.

1205
01:07:13,083 --> 01:07:16,195
Brushing? I thought you were eyelinering.

1206
01:07:16,197 --> 01:07:17,310
Multitasking.

1207
01:07:17,312 --> 01:07:19,125
We'll be out soon.

1208
01:07:20,382 --> 01:07:21,811
Love you, Dad.

1209
01:07:22,668 --> 01:07:24,254
Oh, for God's sake.

1210
01:07:58,025 --> 01:07:59,954
Oh, hell no.

1211
01:08:02,268 --> 01:08:04,195
Please take us back to my house.

1212
01:08:04,197 --> 01:08:05,253
Take me to a hospital.

1213
01:08:05,255 --> 01:08:05,907
She's fine.

1214
01:08:05,909 --> 01:08:06,908
Or more.

1215
01:08:10,058 --> 01:08:11,167
Goodness.

1216
01:08:14,282 --> 01:08:15,667
Have you been out all night?

1217
01:08:15,669 --> 01:08:16,653
Long story.

1218
01:08:16,655 --> 01:08:18,881
Can you take us back right now, please?

1219
01:08:18,883 --> 01:08:21,881
I have to open my store in 10-

1220
01:08:21,883 --> 01:08:23,507
Oh, come on, come on.

1221
01:08:23,509 --> 01:08:25,022
Please, please?

1222
01:08:25,024 --> 01:08:27,649
Please, Otis, this is really important.

1223
01:08:32,541 --> 01:08:36,165
Seven in the morning
and I'm out driving Miss Crazy.

1224
01:09:01,268 --> 01:09:02,838
Gates' diagnosis.

1225
01:09:02,840 --> 01:09:05,296
Blaire Beckett suffers from herpetophobia.

1226
01:09:05,996 --> 01:09:07,710
I'm not afraid of pets.

1227
01:09:08,407 --> 01:09:10,257
At least we didn't die.

1228
01:09:10,259 --> 01:09:13,140
I could die if I don't sneak past my dad.

1229
01:09:13,240 --> 01:09:14,510
Teddy bear Walt?

1230
01:09:14,512 --> 01:09:15,838
I'm sure you'll be fine.

1231
01:09:15,840 --> 01:09:18,011
You've never seen grizzly bear Walt.

1232
01:09:18,296 --> 01:09:20,754
At least there's someone to care
if you were gone.

1233
01:09:20,758 --> 01:09:21,888
You know,

1234
01:09:22,087 --> 01:09:25,780
comparison is the thief of joy.

1235
01:09:25,782 --> 01:09:29,838
Otis, there's a homeless man
in the back of your truck.

1236
01:09:29,840 --> 01:09:32,295
Hey, I'm not homeless.

1237
01:09:32,297 --> 01:09:34,094
I pay rent here.

1238
01:09:34,096 --> 01:09:35,682
Morning, Cliff.

1239
01:09:36,453 --> 01:09:38,824
Aren't you going to open up the pet store?

1240
01:09:38,826 --> 01:09:41,094
These girls need a ride home.

1241
01:09:41,096 --> 01:09:43,923
They've been in and out all night.

1242
01:09:43,925 --> 01:09:46,149
Oh, that explains a lot.

1243
01:09:46,442 --> 01:09:50,274
So which one of you is the screamer?

1244
01:09:51,475 --> 01:09:53,724
I think we found the smell.

1245
01:09:53,726 --> 01:09:55,382
Do you have schizophrenia?

1246
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:56,652
No.

1247
01:09:56,654 --> 01:09:58,538
Manic depressive tendencies?

1248
01:09:58,540 --> 01:09:59,767
I don't think so.

1249
01:09:59,769 --> 01:10:01,468
What do you have?

1250
01:10:02,082 --> 01:10:04,111
Really bad credit.

1251
01:10:05,011 --> 01:10:06,696
Have you been drinking?

1252
01:10:07,853 --> 01:10:09,610
Is this the street?

1253
01:10:09,612 --> 01:10:11,425
Yes, pull over here.

1254
01:10:28,217 --> 01:10:29,858
Thank you, Otis.

1255
01:10:30,668 --> 01:10:32,353
I appreciate everything.

1256
01:10:32,825 --> 01:10:34,064
Good luck, kid.

1257
01:10:34,066 --> 01:10:35,294
Hey, Otis.

1258
01:10:35,296 --> 01:10:38,182
Do any exotic birds sound like this?

1259
01:10:40,710 --> 01:10:43,082
No, not healthy ones.

1260
01:10:48,868 --> 01:10:50,150
Hair of the dog?

1261
01:11:08,525 --> 01:11:10,968
Certainly an experience
I won't forget.

1262
01:11:11,339 --> 01:11:12,810
I'm proud of you, Mads.

1263
01:11:12,812 --> 01:11:14,710
Your courage was legendary.

1264
01:11:14,712 --> 01:11:15,827
So brave.

1265
01:11:15,829 --> 01:11:16,780
Why so brave?

1266
01:11:16,782 --> 01:11:19,308
She told Ryan Bright
she had a crush on him.

1267
01:11:19,350 --> 01:11:21,038
That is brave.

1268
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:22,868
He doesn't even know you're alive.

1269
01:11:24,758 --> 01:11:26,400
You said he liked me.

1270
01:11:26,739 --> 01:11:27,853
Ryan Bright?

1271
01:11:27,855 --> 01:11:29,053
Ryan Bright.

1272
01:11:29,055 --> 01:11:31,154
You two have Chemistry together?

1273
01:11:31,625 --> 01:11:33,196
Uh-oh.

1274
01:11:35,768 --> 01:11:38,538
I thought you meant Brian White.

1275
01:11:38,540 --> 01:11:39,725
What?

1276
01:11:41,954 --> 01:11:44,538
Oh, my God. Brian White?

1277
01:11:44,540 --> 01:11:45,910
He's a tragedy.

1278
01:11:45,912 --> 01:11:47,738
Why would I like Brian White?

1279
01:11:47,740 --> 01:11:50,923
I don't know,
I thought it was strange, too.

1280
01:11:50,925 --> 01:11:52,137
You never know.

1281
01:11:52,139 --> 01:11:54,295
Maybe you could have chemistry

1282
01:11:54,297 --> 01:11:55,925
with Brian White.

1283
01:11:56,468 --> 01:11:59,267
Leaving town
sounds like a fantastic idea.

1284
01:11:59,269 --> 01:12:01,566
Still, mission accomplished.

1285
01:12:01,568 --> 01:12:03,068
Bravo, Baker.

1286
01:12:04,925 --> 01:12:07,167
You really are the best friends
in the world.

1287
01:12:07,169 --> 01:12:08,175
Duh.

1288
01:12:08,469 --> 01:12:09,554
Obviously.

1289
01:12:09,954 --> 01:12:11,210
Not now, Blaire.

1290
01:12:11,212 --> 01:12:12,853
Group shot.

1291
01:12:17,025 --> 01:12:19,068
I'm really going to miss you, Madison.

1292
01:12:21,233 --> 01:12:23,341
Oh, come on.
Let's not get Marwen.

1293
01:12:23,343 --> 01:12:24,642
I hate sappy endings.

1294
01:12:25,011 --> 01:12:27,125
Well, safe travels, Mads.

1295
01:12:37,511 --> 01:12:38,925
Blaire, there's...

1296
01:12:40,325 --> 01:12:41,692
Just let it go.

1297
01:12:42,842 --> 01:12:45,650
I'm just going to lay down right here.

1298
01:12:46,339 --> 01:12:47,494
Okay.

1299
01:12:47,496 --> 01:12:48,625
I'll take her home.

1300
01:12:53,025 --> 01:12:55,125
Parting is such sweet sorrow.

1301
01:12:55,825 --> 01:12:57,311
Bravo, Gordon.

1302
01:13:11,325 --> 01:13:12,625
Late night?

1303
01:13:13,096 --> 01:13:15,610
Does your daddy know
that you're just getting home?

1304
01:13:15,612 --> 01:13:17,309
It's really none of your business.

1305
01:13:17,311 --> 01:13:20,296
I just made it my business.

1306
01:13:21,150 --> 01:13:24,517
You should start minding
your own business.

1307
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:33,410
You're lucky you don't live here anymore.

1308
01:13:33,412 --> 01:13:35,625
Mom.

1309
01:13:44,092 --> 01:13:46,508
Dad, there you are.

1310
01:13:46,942 --> 01:13:49,738
Paige said I could find you out here.

1311
01:13:49,740 --> 01:13:52,137
Yeah, I'd hoped to have a talk
with both of you.

1312
01:13:52,139 --> 01:13:55,965
I know, adapting to a new environment
can be challenging.

1313
01:13:55,967 --> 01:13:57,153
We're a family.

1314
01:13:57,155 --> 01:13:59,108
No, no, nothing like that, really.

1315
01:13:59,654 --> 01:14:00,868
What's up, Dad?

1316
01:14:01,517 --> 01:14:04,468
Girls, the job, it fell through.

1317
01:14:05,192 --> 01:14:06,467
We're not moving.

1318
01:14:08,096 --> 01:14:09,325
That's...

1319
01:14:09,625 --> 01:14:11,367
It's okay,
you can be happy.

1320
01:14:11,369 --> 01:14:13,780
I know you're not thrilled about leaving.

1321
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:17,039
I was just starting to look forward to it.

1322
01:14:17,041 --> 01:14:18,132
Well, we can talk later.

1323
01:14:18,134 --> 01:14:20,081
I think we can
still get you to school on time.

1324
01:14:20,083 --> 01:14:21,110
School?

1325
01:14:21,112 --> 01:14:22,282
Let's go.

1326
01:14:25,442 --> 01:14:29,916
If you need to text anyone,
I might let you use my phone.

1327
01:15:00,239 --> 01:15:01,111
Hey.

1328
01:15:01,582 --> 01:15:02,796
Need some help?

1329

1330
01:19:13,558 --> 01:19:15,191
You can't hear how bad you are.

1331
01:19:15,193 --> 01:19:16,038
All right, cool.

1332
01:19:16,040 --> 01:19:17,382
Second shift.
