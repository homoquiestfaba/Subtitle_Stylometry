00:00:13,261 --> 00:00:14,094
(radio chatter)

3
00:00:14,094 --> 00:00:17,177
- [Narrator] Radio Moscow said today,

4
00:00:25,448 --> 00:00:27,704
that the final numbers
are in from Stalingrad

5
00:00:27,704 --> 00:00:29,283
and that they are staggering.

6
00:00:29,283 --> 00:00:31,175
Since February 1st, 1943,

7
00:00:31,175 --> 00:00:32,792
the Soviet authorities report

8
00:00:32,792 --> 00:00:36,263
they have removed 147,000 German corpses

9
00:00:36,263 --> 00:00:37,763
and 47,000 Soviet.

10
00:00:39,243 --> 00:00:40,563
(radio chatter)

11
00:00:40,563 --> 00:00:44,313
(inspiring orchestral music)

12
00:00:47,785 --> 00:00:48,865
- [Radio Announcer] In
the Solomon Islands,

13
00:00:48,865 --> 00:00:51,446
US Navy planes reportedly
launched round the clock attacks

14
00:00:51,446 --> 00:00:53,089
against Japanese positions.

15
00:00:53,089 --> 00:00:56,642
- [Radio Announcer] The first
allied footfall in Europe

16
00:00:56,642 --> 00:00:59,178
comes in Sicily, off the
toe of the boot of Italy,

17
00:00:59,178 --> 00:01:01,368
where British and American
troops under General Alexander,

18
00:01:01,368 --> 00:01:04,352
stormed Europe for the first time.

19
00:01:04,352 --> 00:01:07,019
(radio chatter)

20
00:01:08,984 --> 00:01:10,524
- [Radio Announcer] Reports are coming in

21
00:01:10,524 --> 00:01:12,547
of the greatest land battle ever fought.

22
00:01:12,547 --> 00:01:13,577
Two million men--

23
00:01:13,577 --> 00:01:18,340
- [Churchill] The weather
been unsuitable over Berlin.

24
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:20,191
We dropped about 800 tons

25
00:01:20,191 --> 00:01:22,595
last night on Hamburg.

26
00:01:22,595 --> 00:01:26,201
I expect the experience will make them

27
00:01:26,201 --> 00:01:29,618
less keen about war than they used to be.

28
00:01:30,753 --> 00:01:34,286
- The big question is,
can we work with Russia?

29
00:01:34,286 --> 00:01:36,119
Now and after the war?

30
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:39,920
- I must admit,

31
00:01:40,806 --> 00:01:43,973
I thought is most primarily in Europe.

32
00:01:45,468 --> 00:01:46,598
The parent continent of the

33
00:01:46,598 --> 00:01:49,348
modern nations and civilizations.

34
00:01:52,998 --> 00:01:54,634
It would be a measureless disaster

35
00:01:54,634 --> 00:01:57,620
if Russian barbarism overlayed
the culture and independence

36
00:01:57,620 --> 00:02:00,287
of the ancient states of Europe.

37
00:02:01,411 --> 00:02:03,626
- They will never accept the idea

38
00:02:03,626 --> 00:02:07,293
this whole great space
should be red, never.

39
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:11,072
Never.

40
00:02:12,624 --> 00:02:13,677
- Mr. President.

41
00:02:13,677 --> 00:02:16,844
- Hello, sit down, sit down everybody.

42
00:02:18,763 --> 00:02:21,558
I see you have been doing your homework.

43
00:02:21,558 --> 00:02:23,096
(all laugh)

44
00:02:23,096 --> 00:02:26,160
Let's talk it through, shall we?

45
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:27,660
According to this,

46
00:02:29,087 --> 00:02:31,133
the decisive effort of the war

47
00:02:31,133 --> 00:02:34,811
must be made against the
continent of Europe from England,

48
00:02:34,811 --> 00:02:36,404
sooner or later.

49
00:02:36,404 --> 00:02:38,469
Although, the British
have rendered lip service

50
00:02:38,469 --> 00:02:39,777
to crossing the channel,

51
00:02:39,777 --> 00:02:42,030
their hearts aren't in it.

52
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:43,931
Their theory is that
Germany can be defeated

53
00:02:43,931 --> 00:02:46,987
by a series of attritions
in Italy, the Mediterranean,

54
00:02:46,987 --> 00:02:50,312
the Balkans, and other
satellite countries,

55
00:02:50,312 --> 00:02:53,051
and the only fighting
that needs to be done,

56
00:02:53,051 --> 00:02:55,252
would be done by Russia.

57
00:02:55,252 --> 00:02:57,625
In light of post-war problems we face,

58
00:02:57,625 --> 00:03:00,406
that attitude towards Russia

59
00:03:00,406 --> 00:03:02,489
seems terribly dangerous.

60
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:07,276
We are pledged quite as
clearly as Great Britain,

61
00:03:07,276 --> 00:03:09,688
for the opening of a real second front.

62
00:03:09,688 --> 00:03:13,319
But none of these methods
of pin prick warfare

63
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:15,818
can be counted on to fool Stalin

64
00:03:15,818 --> 00:03:19,798
into the belief that we
are keeping that pledge.

65
00:03:19,798 --> 00:03:22,965
So, put briefly, what you all feel is,

66
00:03:25,768 --> 00:03:27,601
that the time has come

67
00:03:28,818 --> 00:03:31,259
for us to decide that we must assume

68
00:03:31,259 --> 00:03:34,254
the responsibility of leadership

69
00:03:34,254 --> 00:03:37,587
in this great final movement of the war.

70
00:03:38,777 --> 00:03:41,593
A cross channel invasion, yes?

71
00:03:41,593 --> 00:03:43,343
- You're correct sir.

72
00:03:46,113 --> 00:03:48,368
- Winston has got to be told.

73
00:03:48,368 --> 00:03:50,715
The best way of forcing Germany to fight,

74
00:03:50,715 --> 00:03:53,365
is an invasion across the channel.

75
00:03:53,365 --> 00:03:56,032
- [Man] I'll be back in an hour.

76
00:04:00,469 --> 00:04:02,712
- Have you noticed

77
00:04:02,712 --> 00:04:05,924
the President is a very tired man?

78
00:04:05,924 --> 00:04:07,757
His mind seems closed.

79
00:04:09,621 --> 00:04:12,739
He's lost his wonderful elasticity.

80
00:04:12,739 --> 00:04:15,290
- We can, if we have to,

81
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,827
carry out a cross channel
invasion ourselves.

82
00:04:17,827 --> 00:04:19,191
I'm sure the British would be glad

83
00:04:19,191 --> 00:04:23,997
to make the necessary bases
in England available to us.

84
00:04:23,997 --> 00:04:28,164
- 300,000 dead British soldiers,
floating in the channel.

85
00:04:33,386 --> 00:04:34,886
I wake up at night

86
00:04:36,198 --> 00:04:39,708
and see the channel
floating with the bodies.

87
00:04:39,708 --> 00:04:42,041
With the cream of our youth.

88
00:04:45,622 --> 00:04:49,934
- Keep the Undergrounds open at all times.

89
00:04:49,934 --> 00:04:51,697
I want to send Uncle Joe a telegram

90
00:04:51,697 --> 00:04:55,079
of congratulations on the capture of Orel.

91
00:04:55,079 --> 00:04:57,725
But, since I have heard
nothing from him about

92
00:04:57,725 --> 00:05:00,219
our progress in Sicily,

93
00:05:00,219 --> 00:05:02,926
I have decided to say nothing.

94
00:05:02,926 --> 00:05:05,096
- I have just come back from the front,

95
00:05:05,096 --> 00:05:06,913
and I take this opportunity

96
00:05:06,913 --> 00:05:09,511
to congratulate the British government

97
00:05:09,511 --> 00:05:11,807
and Anglo-American troops,

98
00:05:11,807 --> 00:05:15,949
on their highly successful
operations in Sicily,

99
00:05:15,949 --> 00:05:19,604
which have already led
to the fall of Mussolini

100
00:05:19,604 --> 00:05:22,789
and the collapse of his gain.

101
00:05:22,789 --> 00:05:25,052
(telephone ringing)

102
00:05:25,052 --> 00:05:27,485
- I have heard from the great bear

103
00:05:27,485 --> 00:05:30,193
and we are on speaking,

104
00:05:30,193 --> 00:05:33,026
or at least growling terms, again.

105
00:05:34,401 --> 00:05:36,263
- My dear Marshall Stalin,

106
00:05:36,263 --> 00:05:37,963
may I congratulate you on the tenacity

107
00:05:37,963 --> 00:05:39,805
and drive of your armies.

108
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:41,947
It is magnificent.

109
00:05:41,947 --> 00:05:44,597
We are now at a crucial time in the war.

110
00:05:44,597 --> 00:05:48,226
A time of setting a unique
chance for a rendezvous.

111
00:05:48,226 --> 00:05:51,377
I have the hope that you, Mr. Churchill,

112
00:05:51,377 --> 00:05:53,245
and myself can meet as soon as possible.

113
00:05:53,245 --> 00:05:57,253
I personally, can come
as far as North Africa.

114
00:05:57,253 --> 00:06:00,743
- I too, desire this, as soon as possible.

115
00:06:00,743 --> 00:06:03,311
It would be advisable to select a country

116
00:06:03,311 --> 00:06:07,478
where all three nations are
represented, such as Tehran.

117
00:06:10,215 --> 00:06:12,670
- I am delighted with
your willingness to meet.

118
00:06:12,670 --> 00:06:15,717
Personally, my only
hesitation is the place.

119
00:06:15,717 --> 00:06:19,018
Under our constitution, I must
receive and return documents

120
00:06:19,018 --> 00:06:21,617
to congress within 10 days.

121
00:06:21,617 --> 00:06:24,327
Tehran makes this rather a grave risk,

122
00:06:24,327 --> 00:06:26,592
if flying weather is bad.

123
00:06:26,592 --> 00:06:28,729
I hope you will consider Egypt,

124
00:06:28,729 --> 00:06:30,598
which is also a neutral state.

125
00:06:30,598 --> 00:06:32,559
- I have no objection to Tehran,

126
00:06:32,559 --> 00:06:36,311
which I think is a more
suitable place than Egypt,

127
00:06:36,311 --> 00:06:40,040
where the Soviet Union
is not yet represented.

128
00:06:40,040 --> 00:06:42,575
- The problem of my going to Tehran

129
00:06:42,575 --> 00:06:45,437
is that for constitutional reasons,

130
00:06:45,437 --> 00:06:48,086
I cannot take the risk.

131
00:06:48,086 --> 00:06:50,225
There is a possibility
of meeting at some fort

132
00:06:50,225 --> 00:06:53,558
in the eastern Mediterranean or Baghdad.

133
00:06:54,493 --> 00:06:57,993
Where we can have three comfortable camps,

134
00:07:00,703 --> 00:07:03,243
seeing if worth considering.

135
00:07:03,243 --> 00:07:06,611
- My colleagues hold the
front operations necessitate

136
00:07:06,611 --> 00:07:10,021
day to day guidance by
the supreme command.

137
00:07:10,021 --> 00:07:12,942
In Tehran, unlike the other places,

138
00:07:12,942 --> 00:07:15,573
these requirements can
be met by communicating

139
00:07:15,573 --> 00:07:19,406
directly with Moscow by
telegram or telephone.

140
00:07:20,333 --> 00:07:24,333
For this reason, my
colleagues insist on Tehran.

141
00:07:25,514 --> 00:07:28,468
- I am deeply disappointed.

142
00:07:28,468 --> 00:07:32,416
I must tell you, I cannot go to Tehran.

143
00:07:32,416 --> 00:07:34,494
I must carry on a
constitutional government

144
00:07:34,494 --> 00:07:36,836
more than 150 years old.

145
00:07:36,836 --> 00:07:38,123
If it were not for this fact,

146
00:07:38,123 --> 00:07:42,836
I would gladly go 10 times
the distance to meet you.

147
00:07:42,836 --> 00:07:45,711
Please do not fail me in this crisis.

148
00:07:45,711 --> 00:07:47,833
- [Stalin] The idea has occurred to me

149
00:07:47,833 --> 00:07:51,674
that I could be replaced
at the meeting by Molotov.

150
00:07:51,674 --> 00:07:53,719
In that case, the difficulties of choosing

151
00:07:53,719 --> 00:07:55,719
a place would disappear.

152
00:07:57,473 --> 00:07:59,888
- [Roosevelt] You will be glad to know

153
00:07:59,888 --> 00:08:01,786
that I have worked out a method,

154
00:08:01,786 --> 00:08:05,224
whereby if there is a
bill requiring my veto,

155
00:08:05,224 --> 00:08:08,268
I will fly to Tunis to meet,

156
00:08:08,268 --> 00:08:10,172
and then return to conference.

157
00:08:10,172 --> 00:08:13,407
I am therefore decided to go to Tehran

158
00:08:13,407 --> 00:08:16,324
and this makes me especially happy.

159
00:08:18,456 --> 00:08:20,095
- I am very glad that the President

160
00:08:20,095 --> 00:08:22,428
is willing to fly to Tehran.

161
00:08:24,225 --> 00:08:26,318
I, myself, have for months past,

162
00:08:26,318 --> 00:08:30,284
declared my willingness
to go anywhere at anytime,

163
00:08:30,284 --> 00:08:33,534
when the three of us can meet together.

164
00:08:40,955 --> 00:08:43,205
(chuckles)

165
00:08:50,074 --> 00:08:53,347
- Well, we're preparing for
a battle here, at Tehran.

166
00:08:53,347 --> 00:08:56,435
But you'll find us lining
up with the Russians.

167
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:59,518
- Difficulty is not in winning a war.

168
00:09:00,764 --> 00:09:04,434
It is in persuading people
to let you win the war.

169
00:09:04,434 --> 00:09:05,851
Persuading fools.

170
00:09:07,787 --> 00:09:09,651
I feel inclined to say to the Americans,

171
00:09:09,651 --> 00:09:13,097
all right if you won't play
with us in the Mediterranean,

172
00:09:13,097 --> 00:09:16,930
we won't play with you
in the English Channel.

173
00:09:18,543 --> 00:09:20,825
And they will reply all right,

174
00:09:20,825 --> 00:09:25,663
and we will concentrate all
our effort in the Pacific,

175
00:09:25,663 --> 00:09:27,080
and I will reply,

176
00:09:29,548 --> 00:09:31,844
you are welcome to do so,

177
00:09:31,844 --> 00:09:32,844
if you wish.

178
00:09:34,923 --> 00:09:35,891
- Ah, Harry,

179
00:09:35,891 --> 00:09:37,424
Mr Molotov.

180
00:09:37,424 --> 00:09:40,240
- I was telling the
President Soviet secret

181
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,095
intelligence has uncovered a plot to kill

182
00:09:43,095 --> 00:09:46,345
one or more of the big three in Tehran,

183
00:09:47,275 --> 00:09:49,370
if anything like that were to happen,

184
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:54,094
it could produce a most
unfortunate impression.

185
00:09:54,094 --> 00:09:56,300
- This cannot be denied.

186
00:09:56,300 --> 00:09:58,565
- Marshal Stalin therefore urges

187
00:09:58,565 --> 00:10:01,398
you to move to the Soviet embassy.

188
00:10:03,891 --> 00:10:06,689
- Please thank the
Marshall for his concern,

189
00:10:06,689 --> 00:10:09,035
and tell him that I accept.

190
00:10:09,035 --> 00:10:10,910
I will be over this afternoon,

191
00:10:10,910 --> 00:10:12,423
when I at last will have the pleasure

192
00:10:12,423 --> 00:10:14,756
of meeting him face to face.

193
00:10:22,520 --> 00:10:24,493
I don't believe there's any plot,

194
00:10:24,493 --> 00:10:28,913
but Stalin wants us over
at the Russian embassy.

195
00:10:28,913 --> 00:10:31,914
I don't know a good
Russian from a bad Russian,

196
00:10:31,914 --> 00:10:34,589
I can tell a good Frenchman
from a bad Frenchman,

197
00:10:34,589 --> 00:10:37,894
and a good Italian from a bad Italian,

198
00:10:37,894 --> 00:10:40,539
I know a good Greek when I see one,

199
00:10:40,539 --> 00:10:43,539
but I don't understand the Russians.

200
00:10:47,373 --> 00:10:50,540
(car engines roaring)

201
00:11:01,937 --> 00:11:03,520
- Mister President.

202
00:11:04,723 --> 00:11:07,337
- This is a very great occasion for me.

203
00:11:07,337 --> 00:11:09,875
I've been trying a long time
to bring this about that.

204
00:11:09,875 --> 00:11:10,794
- I am to blame,

205
00:11:10,794 --> 00:11:13,900
I have been very much occupied
with military matters.

206
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:15,067
- Well I know,

207
00:11:16,879 --> 00:11:19,131
what is the situation on
the Soviet battlefront?

208
00:11:19,131 --> 00:11:22,099
- On part of the front not so good,

209
00:11:22,099 --> 00:11:24,417
we are about to lose Kurdistan.

210
00:11:24,417 --> 00:11:25,949
- I wish it was within my power to bring

211
00:11:25,949 --> 00:11:27,465
about the removal of 30 or 40

212
00:11:27,465 --> 00:11:30,662
German divisions in the Eastern front,

213
00:11:30,662 --> 00:11:32,468
and this is one of the things I wish

214
00:11:32,468 --> 00:11:34,021
to discuss here in Tehran.

215
00:11:34,021 --> 00:11:37,617
- It would be of great value
to us if it could happen.

216
00:11:37,617 --> 00:11:39,841
- An additional reason why
I'm glad to be in this house,

217
00:11:39,841 --> 00:11:44,018
is it affords us the opportunity
of meeting more frequently,

218
00:11:44,018 --> 00:11:47,681
in complete informality under
different circumstances.

219
00:11:47,681 --> 00:11:49,946
- You have all the time you wish.

220
00:11:49,946 --> 00:11:51,465
- Is a prime minister here yet?

221
00:11:51,465 --> 00:11:52,485
- He is on the second floor,

222
00:11:52,485 --> 00:11:54,235
this will take us up.

223
00:11:57,825 --> 00:11:59,335
- We are sitting around this table

224
00:11:59,335 --> 00:12:02,030
for the first time as a family,

225
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:04,996
With the one object of winning the war.

226
00:12:04,996 --> 00:12:07,171
We hope to be very successful,

227
00:12:07,171 --> 00:12:09,438
and achieve constructive accord,

228
00:12:09,438 --> 00:12:12,071
in order that we may maintain close

229
00:12:12,071 --> 00:12:16,229
touch throughout the
war and after the war.

230
00:12:16,229 --> 00:12:20,538
Perhaps the Prime Minister
would like to say something?

231
00:12:20,538 --> 00:12:21,730
- This is the greatest concentration

232
00:12:21,730 --> 00:12:24,808
of power the world has ever seen,

233
00:12:24,808 --> 00:12:28,296
in our hands is a possible
certainty of shortening the war,

234
00:12:28,296 --> 00:12:30,450
with the absolute certainty that

235
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:33,895
we hold the happy future of mankind,

236
00:12:33,895 --> 00:12:37,008
I pray we may be worthy of
this remarkable opportunity,

237
00:12:37,008 --> 00:12:38,758
granted to us by God.

238
00:12:39,702 --> 00:12:42,619
The opportunity of serving mankind.

239
00:12:45,387 --> 00:12:50,046
- Perhaps our host would
like to say a few words?

240
00:12:50,046 --> 00:12:54,213
- History has given us big
forces and great opportunities,

241
00:12:56,174 --> 00:12:58,841
now let us get down to business.

242
00:13:00,222 --> 00:13:02,333
- Let us begin with the Pacific,

243
00:13:02,333 --> 00:13:06,753
where America is bearing
a major part of the war.

244
00:13:06,753 --> 00:13:10,060
We are sinking many Japanese ships,

245
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,875
both naval and merchant,

246
00:13:11,875 --> 00:13:14,552
more than they could possibly replace,

247
00:13:14,552 --> 00:13:18,719
we've been moving toward Japan
from the south and the east,

248
00:13:19,577 --> 00:13:23,181
it is necessary for us
to keep China in the war,

249
00:13:23,181 --> 00:13:25,156
so we have arranged plans for operations

250
00:13:25,156 --> 00:13:27,433
through North Burma,

251
00:13:27,433 --> 00:13:31,516
now this whole operation
covers a huge territory,

252
00:13:32,545 --> 00:13:34,656
and large numbers of ships and men

253
00:13:34,656 --> 00:13:38,095
and planes are necessary to carry it out,

254
00:13:38,095 --> 00:13:40,914
now as to the operations which are

255
00:13:40,914 --> 00:13:45,081
of immediate concern to
the USSR and Great Britain,

256
00:13:47,032 --> 00:13:49,325
not only do we want to get across,

257
00:13:49,325 --> 00:13:53,075
but we intend to proceed
inland into Germany,

258
00:13:55,980 --> 00:14:00,113
now it would be impossible
to launch such an operation,

259
00:14:00,113 --> 00:14:01,696
before May 1, 1944,

260
00:14:04,258 --> 00:14:08,341
the channel is such a
disagreeable body of water,

261
00:14:09,351 --> 00:14:11,739
we cannot do everything
we would like to do,

262
00:14:11,739 --> 00:14:16,047
in the Mediterranean and
out of the United Kingdom,

263
00:14:16,047 --> 00:14:20,214
we should like to have the
advice of our Soviet friends,

264
00:14:21,574 --> 00:14:23,850
as to how we could best
ease their position.

265
00:14:23,850 --> 00:14:25,324
- There are no differences between

266
00:14:25,324 --> 00:14:27,570
Great Britain and the United States,

267
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:30,320
except as regards ways and means.

268
00:14:34,650 --> 00:14:36,731
- The USSR believes that operations

269
00:14:36,731 --> 00:14:39,314
in Italy are of no great value,

270
00:14:40,343 --> 00:14:41,894
a more suitable sector for a blow

271
00:14:41,894 --> 00:14:45,086
at Germany is from northern France,

272
00:14:45,086 --> 00:14:47,056
but it must be expected that the Germans

273
00:14:47,056 --> 00:14:51,565
will fight like devils to
prevent such an attack.

274
00:14:51,565 --> 00:14:53,209
- We have long agreed that an invasion

275
00:14:53,209 --> 00:14:56,480
of France across the Channel
should be undertaken,

276
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,563
and we are resolved to do so in 1944,

277
00:15:00,427 --> 00:15:01,260
however,

278
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:06,438
it is ask now what can
be done in the meantime,

279
00:15:06,438 --> 00:15:10,012
that would be of more use and
take more weight off Russia,

280
00:15:10,012 --> 00:15:14,179
possibly without delaying
Overlord more than a month or two,

281
00:15:15,900 --> 00:15:19,150
if the Anglo-American troops take Rome,

282
00:15:23,562 --> 00:15:26,145
then they are left two choices,

283
00:15:28,066 --> 00:15:29,303
one,

284
00:15:29,303 --> 00:15:32,363
keep proceeding to southern France,

285
00:15:32,363 --> 00:15:33,196
and two,

286
00:15:34,263 --> 00:15:37,413
go eastward across the Adriatic.

287
00:15:37,413 --> 00:15:38,766
- It is not worthwhile to scatter

288
00:15:38,766 --> 00:15:41,285
the British and American forces,

289
00:15:41,285 --> 00:15:45,127
crossing the Channel
Overlord should be in 1944,

290
00:15:45,127 --> 00:15:49,162
other operations should be
considered as diversionary.

291
00:15:49,162 --> 00:15:52,129
- This is of considerable interest to me.

292
00:15:52,129 --> 00:15:54,040
- Our experience has convinced us that

293
00:15:54,040 --> 00:15:57,942
a large offensive from
one direction is unwise,

294
00:15:57,942 --> 00:16:00,330
we usually attack from two directions,

295
00:16:00,330 --> 00:16:02,256
forcing the enemy to move his reserves

296
00:16:02,256 --> 00:16:04,589
from one front to the other,

297
00:16:05,595 --> 00:16:07,716
as the two offenses converge,

298
00:16:07,716 --> 00:16:11,848
the power of the whole
offensive increases.

299
00:16:11,848 --> 00:16:12,681
- I think it would be a good idea for

300
00:16:12,681 --> 00:16:14,228
the staff to immediately conduct

301
00:16:14,228 --> 00:16:17,854
a study of the operations
against southern France,

302
00:16:17,854 --> 00:16:19,711
shall we break for a few minutes,

303
00:16:19,711 --> 00:16:23,878
give them a chance to get
started on organizing that now?

304
00:16:29,311 --> 00:16:31,071
- Has anything gone wrong,

305
00:16:31,071 --> 00:16:33,404
a bloody lot has gone wrong.

306
00:16:34,727 --> 00:16:36,570
I will not allow the great campaign

307
00:16:36,570 --> 00:16:38,761
in Italy to be cast aside,

308
00:16:38,761 --> 00:16:41,261
and end in frightful disaster.

309
00:16:43,593 --> 00:16:45,431
Stalin ought to be told bluntly,

310
00:16:45,431 --> 00:16:48,431
Overlord might have to be postponed.

311
00:16:49,712 --> 00:16:52,214
- Churchill likes to take the easy road,

312
00:16:52,214 --> 00:16:55,964
and leaves the difficult
job to the Russians.

313
00:16:57,801 --> 00:17:02,114
- Stalin seems obsessed
with the second front,

314
00:17:02,114 --> 00:17:03,491
I can be obstinate too,

315
00:17:03,491 --> 00:17:04,824
damn the fellow.

316
00:17:10,411 --> 00:17:11,244
Franklin,

317
00:17:12,444 --> 00:17:15,274
might you and I have lunch alone

318
00:17:15,274 --> 00:17:18,524
before our next meeting with uncle Joe?

319
00:17:19,698 --> 00:17:21,948
- I don't think so Winston.

320
00:17:27,916 --> 00:17:29,482
- It's not like him Harry.

321
00:17:29,482 --> 00:17:30,718
- The President doesn't want Stalin

322
00:17:30,718 --> 00:17:32,450
to get the impression that you two

323
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:33,817
are putting your heads together,

324
00:17:33,817 --> 00:17:35,984
hatching your own schemes.

325
00:17:40,554 --> 00:17:44,637
- I can accept he bluffs
as well as the next man.

326
00:17:45,738 --> 00:17:46,571
Harry.

327
00:17:49,074 --> 00:17:49,907
- Sir?

328
00:17:51,126 --> 00:17:53,219
- One thing I will insist on,

329
00:17:53,219 --> 00:17:56,802
that I am host for
dinner tomorrow evening,

330
00:17:58,224 --> 00:18:02,391
to begin with I come first in
seniority and alphabetically,

331
00:18:05,488 --> 00:18:07,584
in the second place,

332
00:18:07,584 --> 00:18:09,298
I represent the longest established

333
00:18:09,298 --> 00:18:11,530
of the three governments,

334
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,447
and in the third place,

335
00:18:14,728 --> 00:18:17,645
tomorrow happens to be my birthday.

336
00:18:28,777 --> 00:18:32,216
There might be a more bloody war,

337
00:18:32,216 --> 00:18:34,348
I shall not be there,

338
00:18:34,348 --> 00:18:35,848
I shall be asleep.

339
00:18:38,180 --> 00:18:41,347
I want to sleep for billions of years,

340
00:18:43,182 --> 00:18:45,849
when I consider the vast issues,

341
00:18:48,606 --> 00:18:51,689
I realize just how inadequate we are,

342
00:18:52,671 --> 00:18:53,504
I believe,

343
00:18:55,249 --> 00:18:57,082
man might destroy man,

344
00:18:58,265 --> 00:19:00,662
and wipe out civilization,

345
00:19:00,662 --> 00:19:02,745
Europe would be desolate,

346
00:19:04,947 --> 00:19:07,447
and I may be held responsible.

347
00:19:09,639 --> 00:19:12,853
Stupendous issues are
unfolding before our eyes,

348
00:19:12,853 --> 00:19:15,748
and we are only specks of dust,

349
00:19:15,748 --> 00:19:18,221
that have settled on the night,

350
00:19:18,221 --> 00:19:20,221
on the map of the world.

351
00:19:22,446 --> 00:19:25,863
Why do I plague my mind with such things?

352
00:19:27,814 --> 00:19:30,897
I never used to worry about anything.

353
00:19:42,209 --> 00:19:45,042
(crowd murmuring)

354
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:47,542
- I'm sure we'll hit it off,

355
00:19:47,542 --> 00:19:49,022
Stalin and I,

356
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,593
as for uncle Joe and Winston,

357
00:19:50,593 --> 00:19:54,563
I'll have my work cut out
for me between those two.

358
00:19:54,563 --> 00:19:57,730
- Who will command operation Overlord?

359
00:19:58,692 --> 00:20:00,754
- It's not yet been decided.

360
00:20:00,754 --> 00:20:04,504
- In that case nothing
will come of Overlord.

361
00:20:06,183 --> 00:20:08,128
- I would like to say
I am a little concerned

362
00:20:08,128 --> 00:20:09,841
at the number and complexity of

363
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:12,785
the problems before this conference,

364
00:20:12,785 --> 00:20:15,019
the British staff and I have given

365
00:20:15,019 --> 00:20:18,307
long thought to the Mediterranean theater,

366
00:20:18,307 --> 00:20:21,869
we are most anxious to have
the armies there fight,

367
00:20:21,869 --> 00:20:25,082
all I want is landing
craft for two divisions,

368
00:20:25,082 --> 00:20:27,098
this cannot be supplied without

369
00:20:27,098 --> 00:20:29,867
delaying Overlord six to eight weeks.

370
00:20:29,867 --> 00:20:33,125
- Overlord is the most
important operation,

371
00:20:33,125 --> 00:20:37,636
nothing should be done to
distract attention from that.

372
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:41,469
I want to see Overlord
undertaken in May 1944.

373
00:20:43,652 --> 00:20:47,152
I insist on knowing the date for Overlord.

374
00:20:49,453 --> 00:20:52,170
- There's no decisive
difference in principle--

375
00:20:52,170 --> 00:20:56,337
- I want to ask Mister Churchill
an indiscreet question,

376
00:20:57,462 --> 00:21:00,213
do the British really believe in Overlord,

377
00:21:00,213 --> 00:21:04,380
or are they only saying so
to reassure the Russians?

378
00:21:05,271 --> 00:21:08,104
(crowd murmuring)

379
00:21:12,935 --> 00:21:15,065
- Provided the conditions
previously stated

380
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:18,690
for Overlord are established
when the time comes,

381
00:21:18,690 --> 00:21:20,311
it will be our stern duty to hurl across

382
00:21:20,311 --> 00:21:24,311
the channel against the Germans
every sinew of our strength.

383
00:21:24,311 --> 00:21:27,144
(crowd murmuring)

384
00:21:40,161 --> 00:21:42,661
Nothing more can be done here.

385
00:21:54,249 --> 00:21:56,310
Would it be possible for us to discuss

386
00:21:56,310 --> 00:21:58,442
the question of Poland?

387
00:21:58,442 --> 00:21:59,905
- Nothing you have said so far makes

388
00:21:59,905 --> 00:22:03,350
me want to discuss the question.

389
00:22:03,350 --> 00:22:05,510
- I have no power from parliament,

390
00:22:05,510 --> 00:22:08,898
for I believe is it prescient
to define any frontiers,

391
00:22:08,898 --> 00:22:11,632
but we might now we're all here,

392
00:22:11,632 --> 00:22:13,564
see if the three of us can form some

393
00:22:13,564 --> 00:22:15,790
sort of policy we can recommend

394
00:22:15,790 --> 00:22:18,873
to the Poles to advise and to accept?

395
00:22:21,894 --> 00:22:25,090
- Do you think we want
to swallow Poland up?

396
00:22:25,090 --> 00:22:27,605
- We don't know how much
you're going to eat,

397
00:22:27,605 --> 00:22:30,172
we believe God is on our side,

398
00:22:30,172 --> 00:22:33,777
at least I have done my best
to make him a faithful ally.

399
00:22:33,777 --> 00:22:36,351
- And the devil is on my side?

400
00:22:36,351 --> 00:22:40,292
Because everybody knows that
the devil is a Communist.

401
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:44,459
And God of course is a
good Conservative (laughs).

402
00:22:48,700 --> 00:22:52,200
(Iranian religious music)

403
00:22:55,354 --> 00:22:56,994
- The way to kill the most Germans

404
00:22:56,994 --> 00:22:59,607
with the least loss of American soldiers,

405
00:22:59,607 --> 00:23:01,849
is to mount one great big invasion

406
00:23:01,849 --> 00:23:04,870
and slam them with everything we've got.

407
00:23:04,870 --> 00:23:05,986
Make sense to me,

408
00:23:05,986 --> 00:23:08,493
makes sense to uncle Joe,

409
00:23:08,493 --> 00:23:11,792
it's the quickest way to
win the war that's all.

410
00:23:11,792 --> 00:23:13,259
The trouble is the Prime Minister

411
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:15,808
is he's thinking too
much about the post-war,

412
00:23:15,808 --> 00:23:17,975
and where England will be.

413
00:23:18,927 --> 00:23:23,581
He's scared of letting the
Russians get too strong.

414
00:23:23,581 --> 00:23:27,082
Well maybe the Russians
will be strong in Europe,

415
00:23:27,082 --> 00:23:29,332
whether that's a bad thing,

416
00:23:30,266 --> 00:23:33,099
depends on a whole lot of factors.

417
00:23:36,245 --> 00:23:37,456
I've got to do something to establish

418
00:23:37,456 --> 00:23:39,873
better relations with Stalin.

419
00:23:41,622 --> 00:23:45,005
(crowd laughing)

420
00:23:45,005 --> 00:23:45,838
Winston,

421
00:23:47,409 --> 00:23:51,576
I hope you won't be sore at
me for what I'm going to do.

422
00:23:59,998 --> 00:24:02,380
Look at old John Bull over there,

423
00:24:02,380 --> 00:24:04,004
you know if he were in a blanket

424
00:24:04,004 --> 00:24:05,349
blowing those smoke signals,

425
00:24:05,349 --> 00:24:06,818
we'd call him an Indian,

426
00:24:06,818 --> 00:24:07,667
well not John Bull,

427
00:24:07,667 --> 00:24:09,326
but Chief Sitting Bull.

428
00:24:09,326 --> 00:24:11,826
(crowd laugh)

429
00:24:13,824 --> 00:24:16,106
Of course Marshall Stalin,

430
00:24:16,106 --> 00:24:18,477
you will understand that any time

431
00:24:18,477 --> 00:24:21,903
you mention the word
Indian to an Englishman,

432
00:24:21,903 --> 00:24:25,572
all he wants is to expand
the beloved empire.

433
00:24:25,572 --> 00:24:28,831
(crowd laugh)

434
00:24:28,831 --> 00:24:30,125
Now we can't have that,

435
00:24:30,125 --> 00:24:30,958
can we?

436
00:24:39,934 --> 00:24:44,365
- I propose a toast to
Mister Winston Churchill,

437
00:24:44,365 --> 00:24:47,865
who nurses a secret affection for Germany,

438
00:24:48,954 --> 00:24:50,545
to Churchill,

439
00:24:50,545 --> 00:24:54,462
who wishes to see a soft
peace for the Germans.

440
00:24:57,009 --> 00:25:00,923
Just because the Russians
are a simple people,

441
00:25:00,923 --> 00:25:03,893
it is a mistake to believe they are blind,

442
00:25:03,893 --> 00:25:06,810
and cannot see what is before them,

443
00:25:07,714 --> 00:25:09,297
you are pro-German,

444
00:25:10,454 --> 00:25:12,381
to make sure that Germany will not

445
00:25:12,381 --> 00:25:15,044
rise again in 15 or 20 years to plunge

446
00:25:15,044 --> 00:25:17,294
the world into another war,

447
00:25:18,621 --> 00:25:21,420
50,000 of their officers,

448
00:25:21,420 --> 00:25:23,753
must be rounded up and shot.

449
00:25:25,456 --> 00:25:28,206
(crowd applauds)

450
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:31,689
- The British Parliament and public

451
00:25:31,689 --> 00:25:34,548
would never tolerate such mass executions.

452
00:25:34,548 --> 00:25:36,381
- 50,000 must be shot.

453
00:25:37,255 --> 00:25:41,232
- I would rather be taken out
into the garden here and now,

454
00:25:41,232 --> 00:25:43,387
and be shot myself,

455
00:25:43,387 --> 00:25:47,443
than sully my own and my
country's honor by such infamy.

456
00:25:47,443 --> 00:25:50,818
- I have a compromise to propose,

457
00:25:50,818 --> 00:25:53,808
not 50,000 should be shot,

458
00:25:53,808 --> 00:25:55,536
but only 49,000.

459
00:25:55,536 --> 00:25:58,036
(crowd laugh)

460
00:26:38,125 --> 00:26:40,695
- We were playing with you.

461
00:26:40,695 --> 00:26:43,112
Where is your sense of humor?

462
00:27:00,976 --> 00:27:01,809
- Someday,

463
00:27:03,302 --> 00:27:06,482
I would like to visit your front,

464
00:27:06,482 --> 00:27:08,232
I am in my 70th year.

465
00:27:09,132 --> 00:27:10,692
- Don't boast,

466
00:27:10,692 --> 00:27:13,859
I am only four years younger than you.

467
00:27:48,947 --> 00:27:50,022
- Winston,

468
00:27:50,022 --> 00:27:51,585
you're fighting a losing battle

469
00:27:51,585 --> 00:27:54,447
in trying to delay the invasion of France,

470
00:27:54,447 --> 00:27:58,614
there's really nothing you
can do but lose with grace.

471
00:28:00,739 --> 00:28:03,572
(crowd murmuring)

472
00:28:09,721 --> 00:28:12,487
(glass clinks)

473
00:28:12,487 --> 00:28:15,320
(murmuring stops)

474
00:28:16,795 --> 00:28:18,545
- Operation Overlord,

475
00:28:20,496 --> 00:28:22,829
will be started in May 1944,

476
00:28:25,347 --> 00:28:27,076
it will be supported by an operation

477
00:28:27,076 --> 00:28:29,125
against southern France.

478
00:28:29,125 --> 00:28:30,208
- Hear, hear.

479
00:28:31,466 --> 00:28:34,884
(crowd applaud)

480
00:28:34,884 --> 00:28:37,637
- I want to call Mister
Churchill my friend.

481
00:28:37,637 --> 00:28:38,678
- Call me Winston,

482
00:28:38,678 --> 00:28:40,836
I call you Joe behind your back.

483
00:28:40,836 --> 00:28:42,393
- I want to call you my friend,

484
00:28:42,393 --> 00:28:45,562
I want to be allowed to
call you my good friend.

485
00:28:45,562 --> 00:28:49,446
- I lift my glass to Winston Churchill,

486
00:28:49,446 --> 00:28:53,730
for whom I have long had
the greatest admiration.

487
00:28:53,730 --> 00:28:56,452
- To my fighting friend Churchill.

488
00:28:56,452 --> 00:28:59,202
(crowd applauds)

489
00:29:06,763 --> 00:29:09,455
- I wish to propose a toast,

490
00:29:09,455 --> 00:29:11,594
to Marshall Stalin,

491
00:29:11,594 --> 00:29:12,849
who is worthy to stand with

492
00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:15,499
the great figures of Russian history,

493
00:29:15,499 --> 00:29:17,332
and merits the title,

494
00:29:17,332 --> 00:29:18,896
Stalin the Great.

495
00:29:18,896 --> 00:29:19,729
- [Man] Hear, hear.

496
00:29:19,729 --> 00:29:20,562
(crowd applauds)

497
00:29:20,562 --> 00:29:23,132
- It's easy to be a great leader,

498
00:29:23,132 --> 00:29:27,434
when one has to deal with
people such as the Russians,

499
00:29:27,434 --> 00:29:31,119
the Russian people tolerate
no less from their army,

500
00:29:31,119 --> 00:29:33,351
even people of medium courage,

501
00:29:33,351 --> 00:29:37,421
even cowards become heroes
in the Soviet Union,

502
00:29:37,421 --> 00:29:40,838
in Russia it is dangerous to be a coward.

503
00:29:42,302 --> 00:29:45,226
- I drink to the proletarian masses.

504
00:29:45,226 --> 00:29:47,927
- I drink to the Conservative party.

505
00:29:47,927 --> 00:29:51,221
(crowd laugh)

506
00:29:51,221 --> 00:29:53,006
- To our unity,

507
00:29:53,006 --> 00:29:54,173
war and peace.

508
00:29:55,101 --> 00:29:56,263
- [All Together] War and peace.

509
00:29:56,263 --> 00:29:57,712
- War and peace.

510
00:29:57,712 --> 00:29:59,187
(glass clinks)

511
00:29:59,187 --> 00:30:03,354
- I would like the privilege
of adding the last word,

512
00:30:04,253 --> 00:30:08,131
these meetings at Tehran
have raised all our hopes

513
00:30:08,131 --> 00:30:11,921
that the future will find a better world,

514
00:30:11,921 --> 00:30:13,593
in our country,

515
00:30:13,593 --> 00:30:17,760
the rainbow is the symbol
of good fortune and hope,

516
00:30:19,312 --> 00:30:22,697
as we prepare to leave
this historic gathering,

517
00:30:22,697 --> 00:30:27,388
we remember we saw today in
the sky for the first time,

518
00:30:27,388 --> 00:30:30,128
that traditional symbol of hope,

519
00:30:30,128 --> 00:30:31,128
the rainbow.

520
00:30:32,213 --> 00:30:34,713
(all applaud)

521
00:30:48,888 --> 00:30:50,330
- When this war is over,

522
00:30:50,330 --> 00:30:51,330
as a reward,

523
00:30:52,207 --> 00:30:54,118
his Majesty's government would like

524
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:57,121
to bestow on you a noble title.

525
00:30:57,121 --> 00:30:58,515
- Membership in the House of Lords

526
00:30:58,515 --> 00:31:01,137
is one reward I do not covet.

527
00:31:01,137 --> 00:31:03,139
- The title is already selected,

528
00:31:03,139 --> 00:31:06,237
you will be named Lord root of the matter.

529
00:31:06,237 --> 00:31:08,654
(both laugh)

530
00:31:13,021 --> 00:31:15,403
- We've got our differences,

531
00:31:15,403 --> 00:31:16,398
but no one could have a better

532
00:31:16,398 --> 00:31:19,398
or sturdier ally than that old Tory.

533
00:31:25,429 --> 00:31:27,262
Stalin is get-at-able.

534
00:31:29,919 --> 00:31:31,373
- Roosevelt has given his word

535
00:31:31,373 --> 00:31:35,540
that large-scale action will
be mounted in France in 1944,

536
00:31:37,019 --> 00:31:39,653
I believe that he will keep his word,

537
00:31:39,653 --> 00:31:41,333
but even if he doesn't,

538
00:31:41,333 --> 00:31:45,500
we have enough forces of our
own to destroy Nazi Germany.

539
00:31:48,348 --> 00:31:51,848
(dramatic military music)

540
00:32:08,233 --> 00:32:09,075
- [Narrator] In England,

541
00:32:09,075 --> 00:32:10,991
the long and eagerly awaited invasion

542
00:32:10,991 --> 00:32:13,337
of the continent of Europe
continues to take shape,

543
00:32:13,337 --> 00:32:15,096
as hundreds of thousands of men make final

544
00:32:15,096 --> 00:32:19,089
preparations under the watchful
eye of General Eisenhower,

545
00:32:19,089 --> 00:32:22,034
the 64,000 dollar question
the whole world is asking,

546
00:32:22,034 --> 00:32:24,896
and Herr Hitler in particular is dying

547
00:32:24,896 --> 00:32:27,115
to know the answers to,

548
00:32:27,115 --> 00:32:28,365
where and when.

549
00:32:37,485 --> 00:32:39,139
- Marshall Stalin,

550
00:32:39,139 --> 00:32:40,868
the general crossing of
the channel will take place

551
00:32:40,868 --> 00:32:41,868
on May 31st,

552
00:32:43,506 --> 00:32:44,821
the date might be shifted two or three

553
00:32:44,821 --> 00:32:46,791
days one way or the other,

554
00:32:46,791 --> 00:32:49,391
depending on weather and tide.

555
00:32:49,391 --> 00:32:52,730
- I'm confident that
Overlord will be a success,

556
00:32:52,730 --> 00:32:53,907
as agreed in Tehran,

557
00:32:53,907 --> 00:32:58,518
the Red Army will launch a new
offensive at the same time,

558
00:32:58,518 --> 00:32:59,545
so as to give maximum support

559
00:32:59,545 --> 00:33:02,295
to the Anglo-American operations.

560
00:33:03,584 --> 00:33:07,084
(dramatic military music)

561
00:33:31,246 --> 00:33:33,110
- If Overlord fails,

562
00:33:33,110 --> 00:33:36,094
the United States will have lost a battle,

563
00:33:36,094 --> 00:33:40,261
but for us it will mean the
end of our military capability.

564
00:33:42,844 --> 00:33:44,268
- Some people think that because

565
00:33:44,268 --> 00:33:46,438
we are the allies of the English,

566
00:33:46,438 --> 00:33:50,495
we have forgotten who they
are and who Churchill is,

567
00:33:50,495 --> 00:33:54,660
the English find nothing sweeter
than to prick their allies,

568
00:33:54,660 --> 00:33:58,479
Churchill is the kind of
man if you don't watch him,

569
00:33:58,479 --> 00:34:00,941
he'll slip a kopek out of your pocket,

570
00:34:00,941 --> 00:34:03,193
yes by God a kopek,

571
00:34:03,193 --> 00:34:04,937
and Roosevelt,

572
00:34:04,937 --> 00:34:07,462
Roosevelt he's not like that,

573
00:34:07,462 --> 00:34:11,330
he'll only dip his hands
in for bigger coins.

574
00:34:11,330 --> 00:34:13,041
But Churchill,

575
00:34:13,041 --> 00:34:14,458
even for a kopek.

576
00:34:17,008 --> 00:34:20,508
(dramatic military music)

577
00:34:40,853 --> 00:34:42,750
- Get me Mrs Roosevelt please.

578
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:45,445
- I have hung very much upon
this operation Overlord,

579
00:34:45,445 --> 00:34:48,472
and I am in this thing
with you to the end,

580
00:34:48,472 --> 00:34:49,758
if it fails,

581
00:34:49,758 --> 00:34:51,925
we shall go down together.

582
00:34:55,096 --> 00:34:55,929
- Babs,

583
00:34:56,792 --> 00:34:58,306
now I can tell you,

584
00:34:58,306 --> 00:34:59,806
tomorrow is D-Day.

585
00:35:01,628 --> 00:35:04,667
no I won't be able to sleep either.

586
00:35:04,667 --> 00:35:05,500
- Clemmie,

587
00:35:05,500 --> 00:35:08,833
do you realize by the time
you wake up in the morning,

588
00:35:08,833 --> 00:35:11,500
20,000 men may have been killed.

589
00:35:14,618 --> 00:35:16,909
- Yes, there will be a landing,

590
00:35:16,909 --> 00:35:18,823
if there is no problem,

591
00:35:18,823 --> 00:35:23,352
up until now there was always
something that interfered.

592
00:35:23,352 --> 00:35:27,258
Tomorrow there will be something else,

593
00:35:27,258 --> 00:35:29,244
maybe they'll meet some Germans,

594
00:35:29,244 --> 00:35:32,454
what if they meet up with some Germans,

595
00:35:32,454 --> 00:35:34,994
maybe there'll be no landing then,

596
00:35:34,994 --> 00:35:36,911
just promises as usual.

597
00:35:39,031 --> 00:35:39,864
- No,

598
00:35:40,929 --> 00:35:43,512
this time it will really be so.

599
00:35:45,441 --> 00:35:48,941
(dramatic military music)

600
00:35:50,677 --> 00:35:54,222
- [Announcer] Soldiers, crews and airmen,

601
00:35:54,222 --> 00:35:58,042
you are about to embark
upon a great Crusade,

602
00:35:58,042 --> 00:36:01,531
towards which we have
striven these many months,

603
00:36:01,531 --> 00:36:04,037
the eyes of the world are upon you,

604
00:36:04,037 --> 00:36:07,440
the hopes and prayers of liberty
loving people everywhere,

605
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:08,690
March with you.

606
00:36:12,514 --> 00:36:13,935
- [Narrator] Almighty God,

607
00:36:13,935 --> 00:36:15,296
our sons,

608
00:36:15,296 --> 00:36:16,875
pride of our nation,

609
00:36:16,875 --> 00:36:19,704
this day have set upon a mighty endeavor,

610
00:36:19,704 --> 00:36:23,056
to struggle to preserve our republic,

611
00:36:23,056 --> 00:36:26,208
our religion, our civilization,

612
00:36:26,208 --> 00:36:29,458
and to set free the suffering humanity.

613
00:36:33,890 --> 00:36:36,407
- [Announcer] This is the
day and this is the hour,

614
00:36:36,407 --> 00:36:37,355
the sky is lightning,

615
00:36:37,355 --> 00:36:39,466
lightning over the coast
of Europe as we go in,

616
00:36:39,466 --> 00:36:41,249
the sun is blazing down brightly now,

617
00:36:41,249 --> 00:36:43,481
it's almost like an omen the way

618
00:36:43,481 --> 00:36:45,320
it suddenly came out
just as we were going in,

619
00:36:45,320 --> 00:36:46,330
the whole sky is bright,

620
00:36:46,330 --> 00:36:48,773
the sea is a quivering mass of silver.

621
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:50,906
- Between the two pilots of his fighter,

622
00:36:50,906 --> 00:36:54,183
I can see the navigation
lights of the target

623
00:36:54,183 --> 00:36:57,583
mothership, and also the left and right,

624
00:36:57,583 --> 00:37:00,265
- [Narrator] The paratroops are landing,

625
00:37:00,265 --> 00:37:02,531
they're landing around me as I speak,

626
00:37:02,531 --> 00:37:04,903
and they're toppling down,

627
00:37:04,903 --> 00:37:06,411
red, white and blue parachutes.

628
00:37:06,411 --> 00:37:08,569
- [Narrator] Particularly severe weapons

629
00:37:08,569 --> 00:37:10,719
and the German AK-AK defenses,

630
00:37:10,719 --> 00:37:13,622
and flak has been going up all around us,

631
00:37:13,622 --> 00:37:16,238
I can hear that mortar fire
coming in through the--

632
00:37:16,238 --> 00:37:19,596
- [Narrator] All laden up
with equipment so heavily,

633
00:37:19,596 --> 00:37:21,054
that they can barely walk,

634
00:37:21,054 --> 00:37:22,696
but they've got to carry with them

635
00:37:22,696 --> 00:37:26,863
the means by which They can
fight with them as they land.

636
00:37:29,921 --> 00:37:33,088
(repeated loud bangs)

637
00:37:34,029 --> 00:37:37,529
(airplane engines rumble)

638
00:37:46,145 --> 00:37:50,312
(multiple explosions and guns firing)

639
00:38:08,392 --> 00:38:12,059
(airplane engines rumbling)

640
00:38:19,707 --> 00:38:21,307
- It appears that the landing plans

641
00:38:21,307 --> 00:38:26,234
on a tremendous scale has
been crowned with success,

642
00:38:26,234 --> 00:38:28,154
I and my colleagues cannot but recognize

643
00:38:28,154 --> 00:38:29,949
that this is an enterprise

644
00:38:29,949 --> 00:38:32,782
unprecedented in military history,

645
00:38:33,617 --> 00:38:36,169
Hitler the hysteric who for two years

646
00:38:36,169 --> 00:38:38,406
boasted that he would cross the channel,

647
00:38:38,406 --> 00:38:41,727
did not venture even to make an attempt,

648
00:38:41,727 --> 00:38:43,698
none but our allies has been able

649
00:38:43,698 --> 00:38:46,217
to fulfill with flying colors

650
00:38:46,217 --> 00:38:49,884
the grand plan for crossing the channel,

651
00:38:49,884 --> 00:38:54,051
history will record this as
a feat of the highest order.

652
00:39:01,451 --> 00:39:02,700
- Papers should be drafted setting forth

653
00:39:02,700 --> 00:39:07,382
the conditions between us
and the Soviet government,

654
00:39:07,382 --> 00:39:09,882
which are developing in Italy,

655
00:39:10,747 --> 00:39:11,664
in Romania,

656
00:39:12,503 --> 00:39:13,987
in Bulgaria,

657
00:39:13,987 --> 00:39:15,365
in Yugoslavia,

658
00:39:15,365 --> 00:39:17,365
and above all in Greece,

659
00:39:18,303 --> 00:39:21,533
the issue is are we going to acquiesce

660
00:39:21,533 --> 00:39:24,865
in communisation of the Balkans,

661
00:39:24,865 --> 00:39:26,615
and perhaps of Italy,

662
00:39:28,676 --> 00:39:30,277
if the conclusion is that we resist

663
00:39:30,277 --> 00:39:33,583
the communist infusion and invasion,

664
00:39:33,583 --> 00:39:35,586
we should put it to them plainly.

665
00:39:35,586 --> 00:39:38,003
Do you think Marshall Stalin,

666
00:39:39,841 --> 00:39:41,892
the Soviet government might leave

667
00:39:41,892 --> 00:39:44,401
Britain to manage the situation in Greece,

668
00:39:44,401 --> 00:39:46,567
while fighting is still going on there,

669
00:39:46,567 --> 00:39:49,906
and that Great Britain might
leave the situation in Romania

670
00:39:49,906 --> 00:39:54,073
to the Soviet government
during the fighting there.

671
00:39:59,793 --> 00:40:03,984
- My government agrees
with the suggestion,

672
00:40:03,984 --> 00:40:06,708
but before giving any final assurance,

673
00:40:06,708 --> 00:40:08,237
we would like to know whether

674
00:40:08,237 --> 00:40:11,320
you have consulted the United States.

675
00:40:13,803 --> 00:40:15,612
- In our opinion this arrangement would

676
00:40:15,612 --> 00:40:17,033
certainly resolve the differences

677
00:40:17,033 --> 00:40:19,366
between you and the Soviets,

678
00:40:20,450 --> 00:40:21,872
and the division of the Balkan

679
00:40:21,872 --> 00:40:24,455
area into spheres of influence.

680
00:40:26,156 --> 00:40:28,849
I think I should tell you frankly Winston,

681
00:40:28,849 --> 00:40:30,685
that we were disturbed that your people

682
00:40:30,685 --> 00:40:32,350
took this up with this only after

683
00:40:32,350 --> 00:40:34,367
it was brought to the Russians,

684
00:40:34,367 --> 00:40:37,570
and they inquired whether
we were agreeable.

685
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:38,873
- I propose to the Russians

686
00:40:38,873 --> 00:40:40,327
a temporary working arrangement

687
00:40:40,327 --> 00:40:43,006
for the better conduct of the war,

688
00:40:43,006 --> 00:40:44,945
I cannot admit that I have done

689
00:40:44,945 --> 00:40:47,443
anything wrong in this matter.

690
00:40:47,443 --> 00:40:49,193
The question remains,

691
00:40:50,191 --> 00:40:54,586
what should our forces
in the Mediterranean do?

692
00:40:54,586 --> 00:40:57,709
General Eisenhower naturally
wants to strengthen his attack

693
00:40:57,709 --> 00:41:01,473
in north-west Europe
by all available means,

694
00:41:01,473 --> 00:41:04,226
northern Italy does not attract him,

695
00:41:04,226 --> 00:41:05,976
Southern France does,

696
00:41:07,467 --> 00:41:11,318
our first wish is to help Eisenhower,

697
00:41:11,318 --> 00:41:14,193
we do not think this necessarily involves

698
00:41:14,193 --> 00:41:16,374
the complete ruin of all our great

699
00:41:16,374 --> 00:41:18,845
affairs in the Mediterranean.

700
00:41:18,845 --> 00:41:22,012
We take it hard that this
should be demanded of us.

701
00:41:22,012 --> 00:41:24,688
- Use of the Mediterranean resources

702
00:41:24,688 --> 00:41:28,244
to advance on northern Italy
is not acceptable to me.

703
00:41:28,244 --> 00:41:31,213
- Let us resolve not to wreck
one great campaign in Italy,

704
00:41:31,213 --> 00:41:33,155
for the sake of another in France,

705
00:41:33,155 --> 00:41:34,398
both can be won.

706
00:41:34,398 --> 00:41:35,247
- Perhaps so,

707
00:41:35,247 --> 00:41:37,947
but I am mindful of our
agreement with Stalin,

708
00:41:37,947 --> 00:41:40,698
and his view classifying
operations in the Mediterranean

709
00:41:40,698 --> 00:41:42,152
as of lesser importance.

710
00:41:42,152 --> 00:41:43,849
- I don't know what Stalin would say

711
00:41:43,849 --> 00:41:47,201
if the issue was put to him to decide,

712
00:41:47,201 --> 00:41:49,925
it is better to settle
the matter for ourselves,

713
00:41:49,925 --> 00:41:52,340
political considerations
are an important factor.

714
00:41:52,340 --> 00:41:53,395
- Important,

715
00:41:53,395 --> 00:41:55,017
but definitely secondary to the primary

716
00:41:55,017 --> 00:41:57,952
operation of striking
at the heart of Germany.

717
00:41:57,952 --> 00:42:00,322
- What can I do Mister President,

718
00:42:00,322 --> 00:42:02,135
when your chiefs of staff insist

719
00:42:02,135 --> 00:42:05,304
on casting aside our
Italian offensive campaign,

720
00:42:05,304 --> 00:42:07,708
with all its dazzling possibilities.

721
00:42:07,708 --> 00:42:08,541
- In Tehran,

722
00:42:08,541 --> 00:42:11,791
we agreed on a definite plan of attack,

723
00:42:13,483 --> 00:42:15,387
my dear friend,

724
00:42:15,387 --> 00:42:18,952
I beg you let us go ahead with our plan,

725
00:42:18,952 --> 00:42:21,515
I honestly believe that
God will be with us,

726
00:42:21,515 --> 00:42:23,258
as he was in Overlord,

727
00:42:23,258 --> 00:42:25,758
and Italy and in North Africa.

728
00:42:27,923 --> 00:42:30,590
- The Americans are bullying us.

729
00:42:31,840 --> 00:42:35,173
We have a big strong dominating partner,

730
00:42:36,031 --> 00:42:38,948
not one who sees our point of view.

731
00:42:40,406 --> 00:42:41,239
Good God,

732
00:42:42,841 --> 00:42:44,003
now they say that the Russians

733
00:42:44,003 --> 00:42:47,629
are spreading across Europe like a tide,

734
00:42:47,629 --> 00:42:49,545
they have invaded Poland,

735
00:42:49,545 --> 00:42:50,861
there's nothing to prevent them

736
00:42:50,861 --> 00:42:53,944
from marching into Turkey and Greece.

737
00:43:02,791 --> 00:43:03,624
- Harry,

738
00:43:04,489 --> 00:43:08,656
I distinctly remember ordering
you to take the day off.

739
00:43:09,903 --> 00:43:13,041
- This cable's coming in
from Harriman in Moscow,

740
00:43:13,041 --> 00:43:14,903
I told him to bring the rest up

741
00:43:14,903 --> 00:43:15,871
as soon as they get it decoded,

742
00:43:15,871 --> 00:43:18,346
now that the end of the war is in sight,

743
00:43:18,346 --> 00:43:21,371
our relations with the Soviets
have taken a startling turn,

744
00:43:21,371 --> 00:43:23,541
they've held up our request
with complete indifference,

745
00:43:23,541 --> 00:43:24,810
and have shown unwillingness

746
00:43:24,810 --> 00:43:27,945
even to discuss pressing problems,

747
00:43:27,945 --> 00:43:28,861
the Soviet's indifference to world

748
00:43:28,861 --> 00:43:32,334
opinion regarding their
unbending policy towards Poland,

749
00:43:32,334 --> 00:43:35,326
is best described by Molotov statement,

750
00:43:35,326 --> 00:43:37,000
that the Russians judge their friends

751
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:40,790
by those that accept the Soviet position,

752
00:43:40,790 --> 00:43:42,454
the general attitude seems to be that

753
00:43:42,454 --> 00:43:46,049
is our obligation to help
Russia and accept her policies,

754
00:43:46,049 --> 00:43:48,350
because she has won the war for us,

755
00:43:48,350 --> 00:43:49,710
they have misinterpreted our generous

756
00:43:49,710 --> 00:43:50,951
attitude towards them as a sign

757
00:43:50,951 --> 00:43:54,701
of weakness and acceptance
of their policies.

758
00:43:56,459 --> 00:43:57,409
- The time has come,

759
00:43:57,409 --> 00:43:59,410
we must make clear what
we expect from them,

760
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:00,893
as the price of our goodwill,

761
00:44:00,893 --> 00:44:03,498
unless we take issue
with the present policy,

762
00:44:03,498 --> 00:44:04,611
there is every indication that

763
00:44:04,611 --> 00:44:08,194
the Soviet Union will
become a world bully.

764
00:44:10,285 --> 00:44:13,285
Whenever her interests are involved.

765
00:44:20,442 --> 00:44:22,878
There are two kinds of people,

766
00:44:22,878 --> 00:44:26,716
those who believe that we must
cooperate with the Russians,

767
00:44:26,716 --> 00:44:30,586
and trust Russia for
the peace of the world,

768
00:44:30,586 --> 00:44:33,154
and those who agree with Winston,

769
00:44:33,154 --> 00:44:36,168
when he says what are we going to have,

770
00:44:36,168 --> 00:44:38,511
between the white snows of Russia

771
00:44:38,511 --> 00:44:41,750
and the White Cliffs of Dover.

772
00:44:41,750 --> 00:44:46,312
I belong to the cooperation
and trust school.

773
00:44:46,312 --> 00:44:47,445
- Red Army,

774
00:44:47,445 --> 00:44:48,278
Red Army,

775
00:44:50,039 --> 00:44:51,709
once they get into our country

776
00:44:51,709 --> 00:44:54,598
it's not going to be easy to get them out,

777
00:44:54,598 --> 00:44:56,451
Stalin will take what he wants,

778
00:44:56,451 --> 00:44:59,118
the Americans have seen to that.

779
00:45:01,329 --> 00:45:05,078
If I could only win Stalin's friendship,

780
00:45:05,078 --> 00:45:06,347
after all it's stupid for the President

781
00:45:06,347 --> 00:45:10,514
to suppose that he's the only
person that can handle him,

782
00:45:12,217 --> 00:45:14,826
I talk to him quite easily,

783
00:45:14,826 --> 00:45:17,287
one human being to another,

784
00:45:17,287 --> 00:45:19,340
I thought Stalin would be sensible,

785
00:45:19,340 --> 00:45:21,007
I'm going to Moscow.

786
00:45:22,568 --> 00:45:24,205
- Winston,

787
00:45:24,205 --> 00:45:25,534
it would be my hope that no meeting

788
00:45:25,534 --> 00:45:29,570
would be held until we all get together,

789
00:45:29,570 --> 00:45:31,438
but I'll consider your talks as merely

790
00:45:31,438 --> 00:45:35,355
preliminary to a conference
of all three of us.

791
00:45:36,997 --> 00:45:37,997
- Of course.

792
00:45:45,050 --> 00:45:47,874
I want to tell you why
I've come to Moscow,

793
00:45:47,874 --> 00:45:51,549
the President and I have been
like brothers in this war,

794
00:45:51,549 --> 00:45:53,206
but I don't want the Russians to feel

795
00:45:53,206 --> 00:45:56,173
that this is just an Anglo-Saxon affair,

796
00:45:56,173 --> 00:45:58,696
I want you to know it is the three of us,

797
00:45:58,696 --> 00:46:02,538
we can settle everything we
three if we come together,

798
00:46:02,538 --> 00:46:03,801
if we do not,

799
00:46:03,801 --> 00:46:07,354
it will mean years of
diplomatic wrangling,

800
00:46:07,354 --> 00:46:08,521
and suspicion,

801
00:46:10,289 --> 00:46:14,406
I would like to begin with
the most tiresome question,

802
00:46:14,406 --> 00:46:15,239
Poland.

803
00:46:16,907 --> 00:46:21,068
You recognize those that call Warsaw Poles

804
00:46:21,068 --> 00:46:22,617
as having a legitimate claim

805
00:46:22,617 --> 00:46:26,470
to be the government of a restored Poland,

806
00:46:26,470 --> 00:46:29,927
we and the Americans believe
those we call the London Poles,

807
00:46:29,927 --> 00:46:31,896
should be the government,

808
00:46:31,896 --> 00:46:33,580
as we feel they more represent

809
00:46:33,580 --> 00:46:36,228
the wishes of the Polish people,

810
00:46:36,228 --> 00:46:39,575
we should have a common policy,

811
00:46:39,575 --> 00:46:43,479
at present each of us has
a gamecock in his hand.

812
00:46:43,479 --> 00:46:46,065
- It would be difficult
without a gamecock,

813
00:46:46,065 --> 00:46:48,595
they are the morning signal.

814
00:46:48,595 --> 00:46:51,131
- The difficulty about the Poles

815
00:46:51,131 --> 00:46:53,646
is they have unwise political leaders,

816
00:46:53,646 --> 00:46:56,799
Where there are two Poles
there is one quarrel.

817
00:46:56,799 --> 00:46:58,202
- Where there is one Pole he begins

818
00:46:58,202 --> 00:47:02,132
to quarrel with himself
through sheer boredom.

819
00:47:02,132 --> 00:47:03,527
- The leader of the London Poles

820
00:47:03,527 --> 00:47:05,915
is a peasant and very obstinate.

821
00:47:05,915 --> 00:47:07,770
- I am a peasant too.

822
00:47:07,770 --> 00:47:11,187
- You can be as obstinate as any of them.

823
00:47:12,347 --> 00:47:14,443
We'll bring pressure on the Polish

824
00:47:14,443 --> 00:47:16,729
government in exile in London,

825
00:47:16,729 --> 00:47:17,562
the Poles here,

826
00:47:17,562 --> 00:47:19,353
the Warsaw Poles are of course

827
00:47:19,353 --> 00:47:21,853
already in agreement with you.

828
00:47:24,104 --> 00:47:28,271
Now let us settle about
our affairs in the Balkans,

829
00:47:29,154 --> 00:47:33,237
Don't let us get at cross
purposes in small ways.

830
00:47:34,604 --> 00:47:38,187
As far as Britain and
Russia are concerned,

831
00:47:39,181 --> 00:47:40,769
how would it do for you to have

832
00:47:40,769 --> 00:47:43,436
90 percent dominance in Romania?

833
00:47:46,937 --> 00:47:49,604
We do have 90 percent in Greece,

834
00:47:52,753 --> 00:47:55,900
in accord with the Americans,

835
00:47:55,900 --> 00:47:58,483
50 50, Yugoslavia and Hungary,

836
00:48:04,818 --> 00:48:07,985
in Bulgaria you would have 75 percent,

837
00:48:09,130 --> 00:48:11,213
we would have 25 percent.

838
00:48:17,528 --> 00:48:20,816
We have a particular interest in Greece,

839
00:48:20,816 --> 00:48:22,867
just as you do in Romania,

840
00:48:22,867 --> 00:48:26,003
we must be the leading
Mediterranean power,

841
00:48:26,003 --> 00:48:27,870
it's a serious matter for Britain

842
00:48:27,870 --> 00:48:32,089
when the Mediterranean
route is not in her hands.

843
00:48:32,089 --> 00:48:36,159
- Britain should have
the first say in Greece.

844
00:48:36,159 --> 00:48:38,607
- It is better to express these
things in diplomatic terms,

845
00:48:38,607 --> 00:48:42,738
and not use the phrase
dividing into spheres,

846
00:48:42,738 --> 00:48:45,357
because the Americans might be shocked,

847
00:48:45,357 --> 00:48:48,764
but as long as you and I
can understand each other,

848
00:48:48,764 --> 00:48:52,014
I can explain matters to the President.

849
00:49:07,702 --> 00:49:09,508
Might it not be thought rather cynical,

850
00:49:09,508 --> 00:49:13,378
if it seemed we had
disposed of these issues,

851
00:49:13,378 --> 00:49:16,297
so fateful to millions of people,

852
00:49:16,297 --> 00:49:18,464
in such an offhand manner.

853
00:49:19,617 --> 00:49:21,573
Let us just burn the paper.

854
00:49:21,573 --> 00:49:23,225
- No,

855
00:49:23,225 --> 00:49:24,225
you keep it.

856
00:49:34,030 --> 00:49:36,047
- I feel very deeply the responsibility

857
00:49:36,047 --> 00:49:37,882
which lays on me trying to frame

858
00:49:37,882 --> 00:49:41,382
proposals for a Russian Polish settlement.

859
00:49:42,303 --> 00:49:46,470
- Poland is fortunate that
I have not asked for more,

860
00:49:47,747 --> 00:49:49,264
you know we don't intend to make

861
00:49:49,264 --> 00:49:53,149
Poland a communist state after the war,

862
00:49:53,149 --> 00:49:56,409
Communism does not fit to Poles,

863
00:49:56,409 --> 00:49:58,900
they are too nationalistic,

864
00:49:58,900 --> 00:50:00,567
too individualistic,

865
00:50:01,501 --> 00:50:05,668
Poland's future should be
based on private enterprise.

866
00:50:08,310 --> 00:50:11,143
Poland will be a capitalist state.

867
00:50:15,377 --> 00:50:19,369
Russia really has no wish to
convert the world to communism,

868
00:50:19,369 --> 00:50:21,036
as many people fear.

869
00:50:24,415 --> 00:50:28,595
We Russians are not as
clever as you think,

870
00:50:28,595 --> 00:50:29,988
we are simple,

871
00:50:29,988 --> 00:50:31,155
rather stupid,

872
00:50:32,494 --> 00:50:34,775
no one in Europe could be persuaded

873
00:50:34,775 --> 00:50:38,108
that England is either simple or stupid.

874
00:50:39,653 --> 00:50:42,025
I do not speak much,

875
00:50:42,025 --> 00:50:45,483
but drinking loosens the tongue,

876
00:50:45,483 --> 00:50:47,684
I am a rough man,

877
00:50:47,684 --> 00:50:50,191
and not much good at compliments.

878
00:50:50,191 --> 00:50:51,645
- After all,

879
00:50:51,645 --> 00:50:53,929
as I always tell the House of Commons,

880
00:50:53,929 --> 00:50:55,443
it's you Russians who have torn

881
00:50:55,443 --> 00:50:57,346
the guts out of the foul Hun.

882
00:50:57,346 --> 00:50:58,929
- Guts is the word.

883
00:51:04,475 --> 00:51:05,820
- I'm glad now that I did not kill

884
00:51:05,820 --> 00:51:09,987
you back in 1919 when I
opposed the Russian Revolution,

885
00:51:11,251 --> 00:51:14,809
and hope you are glad you did not kill me.

886
00:51:14,809 --> 00:51:17,624
- There is a Russian proverb,

887
00:51:17,624 --> 00:51:20,240
a man's eyes should be torn out

888
00:51:20,240 --> 00:51:22,573
if he can only see the past.

889
00:51:36,389 --> 00:51:37,553
- I must say,

890
00:51:37,553 --> 00:51:40,560
I greatly covet that man's good will.

891
00:51:40,560 --> 00:51:43,560
Stalin looks much older than Tehran,

892
00:51:44,684 --> 00:51:46,440
he's not a good color,

893
00:51:46,440 --> 00:51:47,955
ashen,

894
00:51:47,955 --> 00:51:49,122
yes that's it,

895
00:51:49,975 --> 00:51:53,368
if anything should happen to
him it would be a catastrophe,

896
00:51:53,368 --> 00:51:55,420
when this fellow goes,

897
00:51:55,420 --> 00:51:57,716
we don't know what will happen to Europe,

898
00:51:57,716 --> 00:51:59,966
it may be a lot of trouble.

899
00:52:03,604 --> 00:52:06,679
- I'm sure that the
progress made in Moscow,

900
00:52:06,679 --> 00:52:09,341
will facilitate the work
of our next meeting,

901
00:52:09,341 --> 00:52:12,937
when all three of us should
reach full agreement,

902
00:52:12,937 --> 00:52:15,523
I'm thinking of the
practicality of Cyprus,

903
00:52:15,523 --> 00:52:16,788
Athens,

904
00:52:16,788 --> 00:52:18,032
or Malta.

905
00:52:18,032 --> 00:52:19,574
- If the idea of our meeting on the

906
00:52:19,574 --> 00:52:22,755
Soviet Black Sea appears
acceptable to you,

907
00:52:22,755 --> 00:52:26,382
I would consider it very desirable.

908
00:52:26,382 --> 00:52:27,715
- The Black Sea.

909
00:52:29,212 --> 00:52:33,763
Doc McIntyre says all sorts
of diseases are rampant there,

910
00:52:33,763 --> 00:52:36,510
dysentery to the bubonic plague.

911
00:52:36,510 --> 00:52:38,470
- Since my doctors do not recommend that

912
00:52:38,470 --> 00:52:41,474
I take any great trips
at the present time,

913
00:52:41,474 --> 00:52:44,583
I have to give consideration to them.

914
00:52:44,583 --> 00:52:48,375
- His doctors don't want
to make any big trips.

915
00:52:48,375 --> 00:52:49,661
- Herman told Stalin that he hoped

916
00:52:49,661 --> 00:52:51,710
either the doctors would
change their minds,

917
00:52:51,710 --> 00:52:54,293
or Stalin would change doctors.

918
00:52:57,249 --> 00:52:59,769
- I consider the Black
Sea out of the question,

919
00:52:59,769 --> 00:53:03,960
I am somewhat attracted to
the suggestion of Jerusalem.

920
00:53:03,960 --> 00:53:05,354
- I don't think there's any chance

921
00:53:05,354 --> 00:53:07,129
he will agree to Jerusalem.

922
00:53:07,129 --> 00:53:10,404
- I think we ought to put
the proposition to uncle Joe,

923
00:53:10,404 --> 00:53:13,416
it's on him the onus of refusing,

924
00:53:13,416 --> 00:53:17,528
after all, we are respectable people too.

925
00:53:17,528 --> 00:53:18,945
- Marshal Stalin,

926
00:53:20,637 --> 00:53:25,547
my navy people recommend
strongly against the Black Sea.

927
00:53:25,547 --> 00:53:27,764
- I greatly regret that.

928
00:53:27,764 --> 00:53:28,712
- Mister President,

929
00:53:28,712 --> 00:53:29,611
there's not a chance of getting

930
00:53:29,611 --> 00:53:31,132
Stalin out of Russia at this time,

931
00:53:31,132 --> 00:53:34,041
we might as well make up
our minds to go to Russia.

932
00:53:34,041 --> 00:53:35,337
- I suggest Yalta.

933
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,920
On the Black Sea in the Crimea.

934
00:53:41,194 --> 00:53:44,059
- I am prepared to go to Yalta,

935
00:53:44,059 --> 00:53:47,421
we will arrive by plane from
some Mediterranean port.

936
00:53:47,421 --> 00:53:48,254
- Malta,

937
00:53:49,901 --> 00:53:50,984
Malta, Yalta.

938
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:57,648
No more let us falter from Malta to Yalta,

939
00:53:58,542 --> 00:53:59,959
let nobody alter,

940
00:54:02,568 --> 00:54:04,653
if we had spent 10 years on research,

941
00:54:04,653 --> 00:54:09,011
we could not have found
a worse place than Yalta,

942
00:54:09,011 --> 00:54:11,399
but I feel like I can survive it,

943
00:54:11,399 --> 00:54:15,193
by bringing an adequate
adequate supply of whiskey.

944
00:54:15,193 --> 00:54:17,045
It's good for typhus,

945
00:54:17,045 --> 00:54:18,490
and deadly on lice,

946
00:54:18,490 --> 00:54:21,478
which thrive in those parts.

947
00:54:21,478 --> 00:54:24,643
Franklin, would it be
possible for you to spend

948
00:54:24,643 --> 00:54:27,309
two or three nights at Malta,

949
00:54:27,309 --> 00:54:30,943
and let the staff have a talk
together less ostentatiously.

950
00:54:30,943 --> 00:54:32,150
- The Russians are inordinately

951
00:54:32,150 --> 00:54:34,627
suspicious of any meetings
between Churchill and me,

952
00:54:34,627 --> 00:54:38,651
and that includes secret
meetings of the staff.

953
00:54:38,651 --> 00:54:40,703
With favorable weather conditions

954
00:54:40,703 --> 00:54:43,456
we could be in Malta on February 2nd,

955
00:54:43,456 --> 00:54:44,921
but it will be necessary to proceed

956
00:54:44,921 --> 00:54:48,004
to Yalta by air the same day in order

957
00:54:49,211 --> 00:54:51,692
to meet our date with uncle Joe.

958
00:54:51,692 --> 00:54:55,126
- What are your ideas of the
length of our stay at Yalta?

959
00:54:55,126 --> 00:54:57,449
This may well be a fateful conference,

960
00:54:57,449 --> 00:54:58,613
coming at a moment when the great

961
00:54:58,613 --> 00:55:01,112
allies are so divided.

962
00:55:01,112 --> 00:55:03,910
- No more than five or six days.

963
00:55:03,910 --> 00:55:05,607
- I do not see any way of realizing

964
00:55:05,607 --> 00:55:09,774
our hopes about world
organization in five or six days.

965
00:55:10,802 --> 00:55:13,219
Even the Almighty took seven.

966
00:55:15,507 --> 00:55:18,430
- I am personally fond of Winston.

967
00:55:18,430 --> 00:55:20,290
- As we are unable to meet before Yalta,

968
00:55:20,290 --> 00:55:22,911
I feel that the time
has come for me to place

969
00:55:22,911 --> 00:55:26,023
before you a serious and disappointing

970
00:55:26,023 --> 00:55:30,190
war situation which faces
us at the close of 1944.

971
00:55:31,396 --> 00:55:34,229
We have not yet reached the Rhine,

972
00:55:35,677 --> 00:55:37,099
and we shall have to continue

973
00:55:37,099 --> 00:55:39,060
the great battle many weeks

974
00:55:39,060 --> 00:55:41,910
before we can establish our bridge heads,

975
00:55:41,910 --> 00:55:46,441
after that we have to
advance through to Germany.

976
00:55:46,441 --> 00:55:50,061
- I have always felt that the occupation

977
00:55:50,061 --> 00:55:53,889
of Germany would be a very stiff job,

978
00:55:53,889 --> 00:55:55,509
because in the old days I bicycled

979
00:55:55,509 --> 00:55:58,017
over most of the Rhine terrain,

980
00:55:58,017 --> 00:56:00,000
I've never been as optimistic

981
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:02,045
as to the ease of
getting across the Rhine,

982
00:56:02,045 --> 00:56:02,878
as many of our people.

983
00:56:02,878 --> 00:56:04,051
It's also clear,

984
00:56:04,051 --> 00:56:08,285
we have to face a marked
degree of frustration in Italy,

985
00:56:08,285 --> 00:56:09,712
the escape home of a large part

986
00:56:09,712 --> 00:56:12,679
of the German forces from the Balkans,

987
00:56:12,679 --> 00:56:14,775
frustration in Burma,

988
00:56:14,775 --> 00:56:17,982
elimination of China as a combatant,

989
00:56:17,982 --> 00:56:20,420
the question very definitely arises,

990
00:56:20,420 --> 00:56:23,170
what are we going to do about it?

991
00:56:24,057 --> 00:56:25,334
- Perhaps I'm not close enough

992
00:56:25,334 --> 00:56:26,824
to the picture to feel as

993
00:56:26,824 --> 00:56:31,015
disappointed with the
war situation as you are,

994
00:56:31,015 --> 00:56:35,331
you and I are now in the
position of commanders in chief,

995
00:56:35,331 --> 00:56:37,225
who have prepared their plans,

996
00:56:37,225 --> 00:56:38,440
issued their orders,

997
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:42,045
and committed their resources to battle,

998
00:56:42,045 --> 00:56:44,247
I still can't see clearly just when,

999
00:56:44,247 --> 00:56:48,414
but soon a decisive break in
our favor is about to come.

1000
00:56:53,256 --> 00:56:56,222
I am personally fond of Winston,

1001
00:56:56,222 --> 00:57:00,389
but I am finding him to be
dangerous and excitable.

1002
00:57:01,499 --> 00:57:02,749
Marshal Stalin,

1003
00:57:03,730 --> 00:57:06,318
the military situation in Belgium,

1004
00:57:06,318 --> 00:57:07,235
is not bad.

1005
00:57:08,903 --> 00:57:12,403
(dramatic military music)

1006
00:57:13,815 --> 00:57:14,648
- Fire!

1007
00:57:22,731 --> 00:57:23,984
- Marshal Stalin,

1008
00:57:23,984 --> 00:57:27,151
the Battle of the Bulge is very heavy,

1009
00:57:28,177 --> 00:57:30,387
and I should be grateful if you could

1010
00:57:30,387 --> 00:57:34,015
tell me whether we can count
on a major Russian offensive,

1011
00:57:34,015 --> 00:57:36,445
I regard the matter as urgent.

1012
00:57:36,445 --> 00:57:38,894
- The weather is at present unfavorable,

1013
00:57:38,894 --> 00:57:42,383
nevertheless taking into account
the position of our allies,

1014
00:57:42,383 --> 00:57:44,489
we will commence large-scale operations

1015
00:57:44,489 --> 00:57:48,821
against the Germans along
the whole central front.

1016
00:57:48,821 --> 00:57:50,287
- I am most grateful to you.

1017
00:57:50,287 --> 00:57:51,926
- It would be foolish of me to stand

1018
00:57:51,926 --> 00:57:55,287
aside and let the Germans annihilate you,

1019
00:57:55,287 --> 00:57:56,998
it would only turn back on me,

1020
00:57:56,998 --> 00:57:59,165
when you were disposed of.

1021
00:58:00,286 --> 00:58:01,119
Continue.

1022
00:58:22,861 --> 00:58:25,131
- Make no mistake,

1023
00:58:25,131 --> 00:58:27,256
all of the Balkans except Greece

1024
00:58:27,256 --> 00:58:29,531
are going to be Bolshivised,

1025
00:58:29,531 --> 00:58:33,326
and there is nothing I
can do to prevent it,

1026
00:58:33,326 --> 00:58:37,931
there's nothing I can do
for poor Poland either,

1027
00:58:37,931 --> 00:58:41,264
best wishes for this new disgusting era.

1028
00:58:49,605 --> 00:58:53,414
There's probably more suffering
on humanity as of this hour,

1029
00:58:53,414 --> 00:58:55,247
than ever before in history,

1030
00:58:55,247 --> 00:58:56,470
as I look out on the world,

1031
00:58:56,470 --> 00:58:58,735
it is one of sorrow and bloodshed,

1032
00:58:58,735 --> 00:58:59,803
the only hope for the world is

1033
00:58:59,803 --> 00:59:01,134
the agreement of the great powers,

1034
00:59:01,134 --> 00:59:02,422
if they quarrel,

1035
00:59:02,422 --> 00:59:04,422
our children are undone.

1036
00:59:05,673 --> 00:59:08,640
- I have high hopes for
the meetings here at Yalta,

1037
00:59:08,640 --> 00:59:10,573
I hope to make real progress

1038
00:59:10,573 --> 00:59:11,429
in strengthening the personal

1039
00:59:11,429 --> 00:59:15,071
relationship between myself and Stalin,

1040
00:59:15,071 --> 00:59:15,904
Winston.

1041
00:59:16,755 --> 00:59:18,542
- My dear friend.

1042
00:59:18,542 --> 00:59:19,375
Harry.

1043
00:59:20,393 --> 00:59:21,711
How was your journey?

1044
00:59:21,711 --> 00:59:23,813
- I slept 10 hours a night
on the sea voyage to Malta,

1045
00:59:23,813 --> 00:59:26,563
but I still don't feel slept out.

1046
00:59:32,946 --> 00:59:34,938
Yes I'm tired,

1047
00:59:34,938 --> 00:59:36,873
so would you be if you spent the last

1048
00:59:36,873 --> 00:59:41,040
five years pushing Winston
uphill in a wheelbarrow.

1049
00:59:42,297 --> 00:59:45,094
- I hope everything had been
done to make you comfortable?

1050
00:59:45,094 --> 00:59:45,949
- Absolutely,

1051
00:59:45,949 --> 00:59:47,772
I'm just delighted to see you.

1052
00:59:47,772 --> 00:59:49,160
- Mister Hopkins,

1053
00:59:49,160 --> 00:59:50,625
please.

1054
00:59:50,625 --> 00:59:51,825
- I must say the military situation

1055
00:59:51,825 --> 00:59:55,492
has improved considerably
since we last met.

1056
00:59:59,132 --> 01:00:01,578
- The President looks frail and ill,

1057
01:00:01,578 --> 01:00:03,161
transparent almost,

1058
01:00:04,116 --> 01:00:06,273
he's very friendly.

1059
01:00:06,273 --> 01:00:08,597
Stalin must realize people in England

1060
01:00:08,597 --> 01:00:11,194
while keen on relations with Russia

1061
01:00:11,194 --> 01:00:13,964
are most worried over Poland,

1062
01:00:13,964 --> 01:00:15,401
we can't agree that Poland should

1063
01:00:15,401 --> 01:00:18,248
be a mere puppet state of Russia,

1064
01:00:18,248 --> 01:00:21,890
where the people who don't agree
with Stalin are bumped off,

1065
01:00:21,890 --> 01:00:25,849
the Americans are profoundly
ignorant of the Polish problem.

1066
01:00:25,849 --> 01:00:28,019
(glass clinking)

1067
01:00:28,019 --> 01:00:31,352
- Welcome Russian friends to the Crimea,

1068
01:00:32,260 --> 01:00:37,078
as host I have the right to
name the presiding officer,

1069
01:00:37,078 --> 01:00:40,245
and that will be Franklin D Roosevelt.

1070
01:00:43,501 --> 01:00:47,334
- I am honored to begin
this great conference,

1071
01:00:49,359 --> 01:00:52,109
I know that while we are here in Yalta,

1072
01:00:52,109 --> 01:00:54,458
we will cover the map of the world,

1073
01:00:54,458 --> 01:00:58,322
but today I think that military questions,

1074
01:00:58,322 --> 01:01:01,825
particularly those on the
most important front of all,

1075
01:01:01,825 --> 01:01:03,250
the Eastern front,

1076
01:01:03,250 --> 01:01:04,993
should be the subject of discussions,

1077
01:01:04,993 --> 01:01:07,101
I want to say first of all Marshal Stalin,

1078
01:01:07,101 --> 01:01:09,419
I doubt whether the Soviet people

1079
01:01:09,419 --> 01:01:11,840
were any more thrilled than the Americans,

1080
01:01:11,840 --> 01:01:15,544
and the British when your armies
crossed over into Germany.

1081
01:01:15,544 --> 01:01:18,794
(people drum on table)

1082
01:01:23,024 --> 01:01:27,228
- We are advancing on
a 700 kilometer front,

1083
01:01:27,228 --> 01:01:30,350
45 German divisions have been routed,

1084
01:01:30,350 --> 01:01:32,094
100,000 prisoners,

1085
01:01:32,094 --> 01:01:33,791
300,000 killed,

1086
01:01:33,791 --> 01:01:34,958
total 400,000.

1087
01:01:37,095 --> 01:01:40,446
The Germans have already
moved to the Eastern front,

1088
01:01:40,446 --> 01:01:41,529
16 divisions,

1089
01:01:43,092 --> 01:01:45,310
we therefore wish you to start

1090
01:01:45,310 --> 01:01:49,477
an offensive for which the
situation is now very favorable.

1091
01:01:52,210 --> 01:01:54,425
Are there any questions?

1092
01:01:54,425 --> 01:01:56,064
- I have several,

1093
01:01:56,064 --> 01:01:57,254
whether we could be more help

1094
01:01:57,254 --> 01:02:00,337
to you reinforcing the Western front,

1095
01:02:01,281 --> 01:02:04,955
or by moving through the
Balkans to join up with you,

1096
01:02:04,955 --> 01:02:07,296
the staff can deal with
the military questions,

1097
01:02:07,296 --> 01:02:10,717
while we deal with the political ones,

1098
01:02:10,717 --> 01:02:15,291
the whole world will have
its eyes on this conference,

1099
01:02:15,291 --> 01:02:16,702
if it is successful,

1100
01:02:16,702 --> 01:02:20,186
we will have peace for a hundred years,

1101
01:02:20,186 --> 01:02:22,959
only the great powers
who have fought the war

1102
01:02:22,959 --> 01:02:26,126
and shed the blood can make the peace.

1103
01:02:27,392 --> 01:02:28,802
- The three great powers who have

1104
01:02:28,802 --> 01:02:31,062
borne the brunt of the war,

1105
01:02:31,062 --> 01:02:32,902
and liberated the small countries,

1106
01:02:32,902 --> 01:02:35,552
should have the unanimous right

1107
01:02:35,552 --> 01:02:38,335
to preserve the peace of the world.

1108
01:02:38,335 --> 01:02:41,473
It is ridiculous to believe
that a small country,

1109
01:02:41,473 --> 01:02:45,649
Albania for example should
have an equal voice with us.

1110
01:02:45,649 --> 01:02:47,514
- I agree that we necessarily bear

1111
01:02:47,514 --> 01:02:50,357
the major responsibility for the peace,

1112
01:02:50,357 --> 01:02:54,037
but I also think that is it essential

1113
01:02:54,037 --> 01:02:56,286
to exercise this power with respect

1114
01:02:56,286 --> 01:02:58,486
for the rights of the smaller nations.

1115
01:02:58,486 --> 01:02:59,449
- Yugoslavia,

1116
01:02:59,449 --> 01:03:01,508
Albania and such small countries

1117
01:03:01,508 --> 01:03:04,425
do not deserve to be at this table,

1118
01:03:05,515 --> 01:03:06,800
do you want Albania to have the same

1119
01:03:06,800 --> 01:03:09,265
rights as the United States?

1120
01:03:09,265 --> 01:03:10,242
- There is no question of the small

1121
01:03:10,242 --> 01:03:13,025
powers dictating to the big powers,

1122
01:03:13,025 --> 01:03:14,584
but great nations should discharge

1123
01:03:14,584 --> 01:03:16,545
their moral responsibility with great

1124
01:03:16,545 --> 01:03:20,687
respect to the rights of smaller nations,

1125
01:03:20,687 --> 01:03:23,796
the eagle should permit
the small bird to sing,

1126
01:03:23,796 --> 01:03:26,546
and care not wherefore they sang.

1127
01:03:30,300 --> 01:03:32,854
- The whole problem of dealing
with the smaller powers,

1128
01:03:32,854 --> 01:03:34,271
is not so simple,

1129
01:03:37,677 --> 01:03:40,244
we have for instance
lots of Poles in America,

1130
01:03:40,244 --> 01:03:42,937
who are vitally interested
in the future of Poland.

1131
01:03:42,937 --> 01:03:45,547
- But of your 7 million Poles in America,

1132
01:03:45,547 --> 01:03:46,797
only 7000 vote.

1133
01:03:52,340 --> 01:03:53,380
I know I'm right,

1134
01:03:53,380 --> 01:03:54,630
I looked it up.

1135
01:03:58,886 --> 01:04:00,498
- I feel the conference should proceed

1136
01:04:00,498 --> 01:04:03,491
to the consideration of
the United States proposal,

1137
01:04:03,491 --> 01:04:07,316
in regard to the new world organization

1138
01:04:07,316 --> 01:04:09,649
to be called United Nations.

1139
01:04:11,387 --> 01:04:12,220
On December 5th,

1140
01:04:12,220 --> 01:04:14,650
I sent you both a proposal calling

1141
01:04:14,650 --> 01:04:18,568
for the unanimity of the four permanent

1142
01:04:18,568 --> 01:04:21,168
members of the Security Council

1143
01:04:21,168 --> 01:04:25,335
in all decisions relating
to a threat to the peace,

1144
01:04:26,738 --> 01:04:29,342
we also feel that any member state

1145
01:04:29,342 --> 01:04:33,495
should have the right
to state its own case,

1146
01:04:33,495 --> 01:04:36,666
- I find the proposals
entirely satisfactory,

1147
01:04:36,666 --> 01:04:38,285
the British government would consider

1148
01:04:38,285 --> 01:04:40,337
they were committing an injustice,

1149
01:04:40,337 --> 01:04:41,868
if reservation were not made in the

1150
01:04:41,868 --> 01:04:43,311
United Nations organization for

1151
01:04:43,311 --> 01:04:46,144
free statement of small countries.

1152
01:04:48,206 --> 01:04:50,050
The matter looks as though the three

1153
01:04:50,050 --> 01:04:52,879
great powers are trying to rule the world,

1154
01:04:52,879 --> 01:04:54,734
whereas our desires are to save

1155
01:04:54,734 --> 01:04:57,877
it from the repetition of
the horrors of this war.

1156
01:04:57,877 --> 01:04:59,728
- I would like to ask Mister Churchill

1157
01:04:59,728 --> 01:05:02,035
for further clarification of what powers

1158
01:05:02,035 --> 01:05:06,766
he has in mind when he speaks
of a desire to rule the world

1159
01:05:06,766 --> 01:05:10,729
who is contemplating such a domination?

1160
01:05:10,729 --> 01:05:11,857
- May I answer?

1161
01:05:11,857 --> 01:05:12,729
- In a minute,

1162
01:05:12,729 --> 01:05:15,225
is that the United States,

1163
01:05:15,225 --> 01:05:18,083
no it is not thinking of such domination,

1164
01:05:18,083 --> 01:05:19,166
people laugh)

1165
01:05:20,194 --> 01:05:22,127
is it Britain,

1166
01:05:22,127 --> 01:05:25,406
no once again it is not Britain,

1167
01:05:25,406 --> 01:05:29,215
these two great powers
are beyond suspicion,

1168
01:05:29,215 --> 01:05:31,444
that leaves the third,

1169
01:05:31,444 --> 01:05:32,277
the USSR,

1170
01:05:33,726 --> 01:05:37,733
so it is the USSR that is
driving for world domination?

1171
01:05:37,733 --> 01:05:40,066
(all laugh)

1172
01:05:43,629 --> 01:05:45,800
it is clear that talk of driving for

1173
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:48,924
world domination is pointless,

1174
01:05:48,924 --> 01:05:50,694
my friend Churchill cannot name a single

1175
01:05:50,694 --> 01:05:53,944
power that wants to dominate the world,

1176
01:05:55,194 --> 01:05:58,145
I will study the proposals,

1177
01:05:58,145 --> 01:06:00,748
we are interested in decisions,

1178
01:06:00,748 --> 01:06:02,081
not discussions.

1179
01:06:05,502 --> 01:06:08,419
(people murmuring)

1180
01:06:13,511 --> 01:06:14,742
- Stalin can't be much interested

1181
01:06:14,742 --> 01:06:17,004
in a world peace organization
like the United Nations,

1182
01:06:17,004 --> 01:06:18,811
if two months after you
sent in the proposal,

1183
01:06:18,811 --> 01:06:20,728
he hasn't even read it.

1184
01:06:22,740 --> 01:06:24,697
- A good beginning,

1185
01:06:24,697 --> 01:06:27,780
there's one thing I want to tell you,

1186
01:06:29,048 --> 01:06:30,267
the Prime Minister and I have been

1187
01:06:30,267 --> 01:06:32,793
cabling back and forth for years now,

1188
01:06:32,793 --> 01:06:35,717
and we have a term for
which we refer to you,

1189
01:06:35,717 --> 01:06:37,134
that's uncle Joe.

1190
01:06:39,920 --> 01:06:41,503
- What do you mean?

1191
01:06:42,602 --> 01:06:44,677
- It's a term of endearment,

1192
01:06:44,677 --> 01:06:47,677
as if you're a member of the family.

1193
01:06:49,387 --> 01:06:51,609
- I think I will leave now.

1194
01:06:51,609 --> 01:06:53,045
- He's just pulling your leg,

1195
01:06:53,045 --> 01:06:54,065
he has known this for years,

1196
01:06:54,065 --> 01:06:57,648
all of Russia knows
you call him uncle Joe.

1197
01:07:00,232 --> 01:07:04,472
- The Prime Minister
rises late in the morning,

1198
01:07:04,472 --> 01:07:06,153
don't you Winston?

1199
01:07:06,153 --> 01:07:07,042
- Yes.

1200
01:07:07,042 --> 01:07:10,281
- And then works hard until mid-afternoon,

1201
01:07:10,281 --> 01:07:12,180
sleeps before dinner,

1202
01:07:12,180 --> 01:07:15,513
and then he's up half the night talking.

1203
01:07:16,352 --> 01:07:18,102
What's your schedule?

1204
01:07:20,317 --> 01:07:22,947
- I work until five in the morning,

1205
01:07:22,947 --> 01:07:26,693
so do all my admirals and generals,

1206
01:07:26,693 --> 01:07:29,360
I sleep until 10 in the morning,

1207
01:07:30,483 --> 01:07:32,929
not so easy in life,

1208
01:07:32,929 --> 01:07:35,096
I do it seven days a week,

1209
01:07:36,065 --> 01:07:39,898
small birds better be
careful where they sing.

1210
01:07:48,553 --> 01:07:50,720
- Before our next meeting,

1211
01:07:51,960 --> 01:07:56,144
I hope you will side with us in demanding

1212
01:07:56,144 --> 01:08:00,357
not less than an independent
coalition government in Poland,

1213
01:08:00,357 --> 01:08:01,940
and free elections?

1214
01:08:03,070 --> 01:08:05,911
- Something will have to be done,

1215
01:08:05,911 --> 01:08:07,494
good night Winston.

1216
01:08:18,298 --> 01:08:20,066
And there are times when a long

1217
01:08:20,066 --> 01:08:22,652
distance point of view is useful,

1218
01:08:22,652 --> 01:08:27,610
my own view is that in
general like Marshal Stalin,

1219
01:08:27,610 --> 01:08:29,610
I favor the Curzon line,

1220
01:08:30,673 --> 01:08:32,380
the most important question

1221
01:08:32,380 --> 01:08:36,555
is that of a permanent
government for Poland.

1222
01:08:36,555 --> 01:08:37,932
Now opinion in the United States

1223
01:08:37,932 --> 01:08:41,515
is against recognition
of the Warsaw Poles,

1224
01:08:43,192 --> 01:08:46,005
that you support Marshal
Stalin on the grounds

1225
01:08:46,005 --> 01:08:49,448
that they represent a small
portion of the Polish people,

1226
01:08:49,448 --> 01:08:54,448
what the people want is a
government of national unity,

1227
01:08:54,448 --> 01:08:58,153
that would represent
all the major parties.

1228
01:08:58,153 --> 01:08:59,465
- I want to see the Poles have a home

1229
01:08:59,465 --> 01:09:03,614
where they can organize
their lives as they wish,

1230
01:09:03,614 --> 01:09:06,136
it must not be forgotten
that Great Britain

1231
01:09:06,136 --> 01:09:09,614
went to war to protect Poland
against German aggression,

1232
01:09:09,614 --> 01:09:12,886
at a time when because
of our unpreparedness,

1233
01:09:12,886 --> 01:09:15,504
that decision was most risky,

1234
01:09:15,504 --> 01:09:19,222
it almost cost us our life as a nation,

1235
01:09:19,222 --> 01:09:21,376
the question is one of honor,

1236
01:09:21,376 --> 01:09:23,185
because we drew the sword for Poland

1237
01:09:23,185 --> 01:09:25,884
against Hitler's brutal attack,

1238
01:09:25,884 --> 01:09:27,719
my government will
therefore never be content

1239
01:09:27,719 --> 01:09:30,053
with a solution which does not

1240
01:09:30,053 --> 01:09:33,553
leave Poland a free and independent state.

1241
01:09:37,364 --> 01:09:40,209
- Mister Churchill has said
that for Great Britain,

1242
01:09:40,209 --> 01:09:43,459
the question of Poland is one of honor.

1243
01:09:44,998 --> 01:09:46,831
I can understand that,

1244
01:09:47,952 --> 01:09:52,119
for Russians Poland is not
only a question of honor,

1245
01:09:54,342 --> 01:09:55,675
but of security.

1246
01:09:58,341 --> 01:09:59,377
The point is,

1247
01:09:59,377 --> 01:10:03,063
throughout history Poland was a corridor

1248
01:10:03,063 --> 01:10:05,480
for enemies to attack Russia,

1249
01:10:06,364 --> 01:10:08,750
in the last 30 years,

1250
01:10:08,750 --> 01:10:12,917
Germany has twice passed
through this corridor easily,

1251
01:10:14,493 --> 01:10:17,158
why were they able to do this?

1252
01:10:17,158 --> 01:10:20,187
Because Poland was so weak,

1253
01:10:20,187 --> 01:10:24,354
Russia wants a strong independent
and democratic Poland,

1254
01:10:25,502 --> 01:10:26,802
why,

1255
01:10:26,802 --> 01:10:29,282
because it is impossible for Russia's

1256
01:10:29,282 --> 01:10:33,449
forces alone to close this
corridor from the outside.

1257
01:10:36,839 --> 01:10:40,263
It has to be done from the inside,

1258
01:10:40,263 --> 01:10:42,180
by Poland's own forces,

1259
01:10:43,691 --> 01:10:47,858
that is why we want a strong
and independent Poland.

1260
01:10:50,500 --> 01:10:54,667
Because Poland is a question
of life and death for us.

1261
01:11:04,359 --> 01:11:08,026
As to the question of
the Polish government,

1262
01:11:09,659 --> 01:11:13,826
it will be difficult to
bring all the Poles together,

1263
01:11:14,792 --> 01:11:16,176
the Poles we support,

1264
01:11:16,176 --> 01:11:17,176
the Warsaw Poles,

1265
01:11:17,176 --> 01:11:20,145
won't even talk about
the fusion government

1266
01:11:20,145 --> 01:11:21,812
to the London Poles,

1267
01:11:23,345 --> 01:11:25,658
I am prepared to support any attempt

1268
01:11:25,658 --> 01:11:28,991
that would offer some chance of success.

1269
01:11:31,223 --> 01:11:32,806
What is to be done?

1270
01:11:35,904 --> 01:11:39,973
- I wish to thank Marshal
Stalin for his remarks,

1271
01:11:39,973 --> 01:11:42,420
we have different sources of information,

1272
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:44,211
perhaps I am mistaken,

1273
01:11:44,211 --> 01:11:46,496
but I doubt the Warsaw Poles represent

1274
01:11:46,496 --> 01:11:49,828
even one third of the Polish people,

1275
01:11:49,828 --> 01:11:51,848
I do not believe it would be maintained

1276
01:11:51,848 --> 01:11:54,815
in power if the people
were free to express

1277
01:11:54,815 --> 01:11:58,982
their opinion, I fear
collisions, I fear bloodshed,

1278
01:12:00,551 --> 01:12:01,700
arrests,

1279
01:12:01,700 --> 01:12:03,228
deportation,

1280
01:12:03,228 --> 01:12:07,145
I fear the effect on the
whole Polish question.

1281
01:12:09,867 --> 01:12:11,426
- The Polish question has been giving

1282
01:12:11,426 --> 01:12:14,229
the world a headache for five centuries.

1283
01:12:14,229 --> 01:12:17,062
(crowd murmuring)

1284
01:12:23,840 --> 01:12:25,203
The long meetings are really Winston's

1285
01:12:25,203 --> 01:12:29,194
fault because he makes so many speeches.

1286
01:12:29,194 --> 01:12:30,647
There are good speeches though,

1287
01:12:30,647 --> 01:12:33,647
Winston doesn't make any other kind.

1288
01:12:34,913 --> 01:12:36,198
Surely there is a way to reconcile

1289
01:12:36,198 --> 01:12:38,365
our differences on Poland?

1290
01:12:39,561 --> 01:12:42,320
You must believe me Marshal Stalin

1291
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:43,904
that our people at home say,

1292
01:12:43,904 --> 01:12:47,268
if we cannot get a
meeting of the minds now,

1293
01:12:47,268 --> 01:12:51,230
when our armies are converging
on the common enemy,

1294
01:12:51,230 --> 01:12:52,444
how can we get an understanding

1295
01:12:52,444 --> 01:12:55,777
on even more vital things in the future?

1296
01:12:57,153 --> 01:12:58,989
- Mister Molotov has worked out some

1297
01:12:58,989 --> 01:13:01,739
proposals on the Polish question,

1298
01:13:02,723 --> 01:13:04,483
but first I suggest that we proceed

1299
01:13:04,483 --> 01:13:08,483
to the question of voting
in the United Nations.

1300
01:13:09,455 --> 01:13:11,673
I will ask Mister Molotov to state

1301
01:13:11,673 --> 01:13:15,284
the views of the Soviet government.

1302
01:13:15,284 --> 01:13:17,147
- We have explanations of the President's

1303
01:13:17,147 --> 01:13:21,281
proposals for voting
in the United Nations.

1304
01:13:21,281 --> 01:13:22,838
The Soviet government fears these

1305
01:13:22,838 --> 01:13:25,239
proposals fully guarantee the unity of

1306
01:13:25,239 --> 01:13:30,029
the great powers and the
preservation of the peace,

1307
01:13:30,029 --> 01:13:32,430
therefore they are entirely acceptable,

1308
01:13:32,430 --> 01:13:36,013
and there is full
agreement on the subject.

1309
01:13:39,623 --> 01:13:42,438
- This is a great step forward,

1310
01:13:42,438 --> 01:13:46,605
which will be welcomed by
all the people of the world.

1311
01:13:47,744 --> 01:13:49,349
- I would like to express my heartfelt

1312
01:13:49,349 --> 01:13:52,320
thanks to Marshal Stalin
and Mister Molotov

1313
01:13:52,320 --> 01:13:54,340
for this enormous step.

1314
01:13:54,340 --> 01:13:55,594
- We are now ready with the following

1315
01:13:55,594 --> 01:13:58,344
proposals on the Polish question.

1316
01:13:59,692 --> 01:14:02,888
- First the Curzon line
should be the Eastern

1317
01:14:02,888 --> 01:14:04,921
frontier of Poland,

1318
01:14:04,921 --> 01:14:08,065
second as to the Warsaw Polish government

1319
01:14:08,065 --> 01:14:12,853
some Democratic leaders from
the Polish service abroad.

1320
01:14:12,853 --> 01:14:13,889
third,

1321
01:14:13,889 --> 01:14:15,664
the enlarged Polish government should

1322
01:14:15,664 --> 01:14:19,166
as soon as possible call
the population to the Polls

1323
01:14:19,166 --> 01:14:22,749
for organization of a
permanent government.

1324
01:14:24,138 --> 01:14:26,083
I feel these proposals go far toward

1325
01:14:26,083 --> 01:14:28,666
meeting the President's wishes.

1326
01:14:33,747 --> 01:14:34,580
- I,

1327
01:14:37,650 --> 01:14:40,771
I feel that progress has been made,

1328
01:14:40,771 --> 01:14:45,268
but I should like the opportunity
to study these proposals.

1329
01:14:45,268 --> 01:14:46,601
- Yes certainly.

1330
01:14:47,654 --> 01:14:49,992
- I agree with the President,

1331
01:14:49,992 --> 01:14:53,273
it would be well to think
more on this problem,

1332
01:14:53,273 --> 01:14:56,270
but I do feel some progress has been made.

1333
01:14:56,270 --> 01:14:57,103
- Good,

1334
01:14:58,217 --> 01:15:02,134
tonight you will all be
my guests at a banquet.

1335
01:15:03,271 --> 01:15:06,188
(people murmuring)

1336
01:15:10,079 --> 01:15:12,230
- The most important thing is to maintain

1337
01:15:12,230 --> 01:15:14,548
unity of the three great powers,

1338
01:15:14,548 --> 01:15:17,592
to defeat Germany and Japan,

1339
01:15:17,592 --> 01:15:18,522
and then we get around the table

1340
01:15:18,522 --> 01:15:21,189
and organize the United Nations.

1341
01:15:26,908 --> 01:15:28,057
- In an alliance,

1342
01:15:28,057 --> 01:15:31,542
the Allies should not deceive each other,

1343
01:15:31,542 --> 01:15:33,517
perhaps that is naive,

1344
01:15:33,517 --> 01:15:36,496
but then I as a naive man,

1345
01:15:36,496 --> 01:15:40,523
think it is best not to deceive my ally.

1346
01:15:40,523 --> 01:15:42,273
Even if he is a fool.

1347
01:15:44,240 --> 01:15:47,496
Perhaps our alliance is so firm,

1348
01:15:47,496 --> 01:15:50,996
just because we do not deceive each other.

1349
01:15:52,115 --> 01:15:54,654
Or is it all because it is not so

1350
01:15:54,654 --> 01:15:56,553
easy to deceive each other.

1351
01:15:56,553 --> 01:15:58,985
(all laugh)

1352
01:15:58,985 --> 01:16:01,048
I am talking as an old man,

1353
01:16:01,048 --> 01:16:02,813
that's why I am talking so much.

1354
01:16:02,813 --> 01:16:05,186
(all laugh)

1355
01:16:05,186 --> 01:16:07,459
But I want to drink to our alliance,

1356
01:16:07,459 --> 01:16:11,209
it should not lose its
character of intimacy.

1357
01:16:15,158 --> 01:16:16,441
- [All Together] Peace.

1358
01:16:16,441 --> 01:16:19,358
(glasses clinking)

1359
01:16:24,370 --> 01:16:28,379
- This is the crucial
point of the conference,

1360
01:16:28,379 --> 01:16:32,925
we take different views
about basic facts in Poland,

1361
01:16:32,925 --> 01:16:35,126
according to British information,

1362
01:16:35,126 --> 01:16:36,628
provisional Warsaw government

1363
01:16:36,628 --> 01:16:38,416
does not commend itself to the great

1364
01:16:38,416 --> 01:16:41,275
majority of the Polish people,

1365
01:16:41,275 --> 01:16:42,862
and we cannot feel that it would

1366
01:16:42,862 --> 01:16:46,195
be accepted abroad as representing them.

1367
01:16:47,999 --> 01:16:51,737
- Now we're going to
hear from old stoneass.

1368
01:16:51,737 --> 01:16:53,681
- The Soviet delegation
is extremely anxious

1369
01:16:53,681 --> 01:16:56,514
to come to an agreement on Poland.

1370
01:16:57,717 --> 01:17:00,467
We propose the following wording.

1371
01:17:02,882 --> 01:17:04,961
The present provisional government

1372
01:17:04,961 --> 01:17:07,833
in Warsaw should be reorganized on a wider

1373
01:17:07,833 --> 01:17:12,000
democratic basis with the
inclusion of democratic leaders,

1374
01:17:12,915 --> 01:17:14,082
living abroad.

1375
01:17:17,763 --> 01:17:19,049
- I'm glad to see that an advance

1376
01:17:19,049 --> 01:17:23,216
has been made, there is an
atmosphere of agreement,

1377
01:17:24,538 --> 01:17:25,804
there is also a desire to put foot

1378
01:17:25,804 --> 01:17:28,054
in the stirrup and be off.

1379
01:17:29,086 --> 01:17:33,043
These might well be the most
important days of our lives,

1380
01:17:33,043 --> 01:17:35,138
I have to give the House of Commons

1381
01:17:35,138 --> 01:17:39,221
real assurances that free
elections will be held.

1382
01:17:41,026 --> 01:17:44,193
I do not care much about Poles myself.

1383
01:17:54,701 --> 01:17:57,269
- There are good men among the Poles,

1384
01:17:57,269 --> 01:18:00,329
in earlier times many
of them were scientists,

1385
01:18:00,329 --> 01:18:02,900
they are brave fighters,

1386
01:18:02,900 --> 01:18:07,067
the Polish have produced
some outstanding artists.

1387
01:18:08,508 --> 01:18:11,602
- And this reorganized government

1388
01:18:11,602 --> 01:18:14,757
shall be pledged to holding free

1389
01:18:14,757 --> 01:18:17,257
elections as soon as possible.

1390
01:18:19,091 --> 01:18:23,258
- I want this election in
Poland to be beyond question,

1391
01:18:24,727 --> 01:18:26,810
to be like Caesar's wife,

1392
01:18:27,999 --> 01:18:31,832
I did not know her but
they said she was pure.

1393
01:18:33,001 --> 01:18:34,900
- That's what they said,

1394
01:18:34,900 --> 01:18:36,650
but she had her sins.

1395
01:18:39,009 --> 01:18:40,660
- Can we add an exchange of ambassadors

1396
01:18:40,660 --> 01:18:44,822
who will keep us informed
about the situation in Poland?

1397
01:18:44,822 --> 01:18:45,655
- Agreed.

1398
01:18:53,523 --> 01:18:55,190
- I want a hot bath,

1399
01:18:56,416 --> 01:18:57,416
a good soak.

1400
01:19:02,078 --> 01:19:05,745
- If I had known how
tired the President is,

1401
01:19:06,696 --> 01:19:10,863
I would have agreed to meet
along the Mediterranean.

1402
01:19:13,979 --> 01:19:15,080
- It all now depends upon the spirit

1403
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:18,404
on which his agreements are carried out.

1404
01:19:18,404 --> 01:19:20,898
- Admiral Leahy says this is so elastic,

1405
01:19:20,898 --> 01:19:22,702
the Russians can stretch it from Yalta

1406
01:19:22,702 --> 01:19:24,367
to Washington without ever breaking.

1407
01:19:24,367 --> 01:19:28,534
- I know, it's the best I can
do for Poland at this time.

1408
01:19:33,806 --> 01:19:35,730
- [Harry] We really believed in our hearts

1409
01:19:35,730 --> 01:19:37,505
that this was the dawn of a new day

1410
01:19:37,505 --> 01:19:42,175
we had been talking about and
praying for for so many years,

1411
01:19:42,175 --> 01:19:43,458
we were absolutely certain we'd won

1412
01:19:43,458 --> 01:19:46,243
the first great victory of the peace,

1413
01:19:46,243 --> 01:19:50,243
and by we I mean the whole
civilized human race.

1414
01:19:51,444 --> 01:19:52,546
The Russians had proved they could

1415
01:19:52,546 --> 01:19:55,161
be reasonable and farseeing,

1416
01:19:55,161 --> 01:19:56,872
and there's no doubt in the mind

1417
01:19:56,872 --> 01:19:58,272
of the President or any of us,

1418
01:19:58,272 --> 01:20:00,229
we could live with them peacefully

1419
01:20:00,229 --> 01:20:04,396
as far into the future as
any of us could imagine.

1420
01:20:07,466 --> 01:20:11,430
- You know I was 28 years old
when I entered political life,

1421
01:20:11,430 --> 01:20:12,866
but even at that time Winston had

1422
01:20:12,866 --> 01:20:17,287
had long experience in the
service of his country.

1423
01:20:17,287 --> 01:20:21,436
- I face difficult elections
in England in the near future.

1424
01:20:21,436 --> 01:20:23,919
- Everybody knows they need a leader,

1425
01:20:23,919 --> 01:20:27,534
what better leader than
he who won the victory?

1426
01:20:27,534 --> 01:20:30,623
- I shall have to speak very
harshly about the Communists.

1427
01:20:30,623 --> 01:20:33,588
- The Communists are the good boys.

1428
01:20:33,588 --> 01:20:35,529
- We are against them,

1429
01:20:35,529 --> 01:20:37,751
and we shall have to make our case,

1430
01:20:37,751 --> 01:20:39,280
you know we have two parties,

1431
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:41,597
you have only one,

1432
01:20:41,597 --> 01:20:43,287
a much easier job of it,

1433
01:20:43,287 --> 01:20:45,329
you have only one party.

1434
01:20:45,329 --> 01:20:47,423
- Experience has shown that one party

1435
01:20:47,423 --> 01:20:51,173
is of great convenience
to a leader of state.

1436
01:20:52,566 --> 01:20:53,983
Mister President.

1437
01:20:55,198 --> 01:20:56,687
Prime Minister.

1438
01:20:56,687 --> 01:20:57,520
Thank you.

1439
01:21:01,723 --> 01:21:04,640
(people murmuring)

1440
01:21:16,404 --> 01:21:18,224
- I understand Stalin,

1441
01:21:18,224 --> 01:21:20,057
and he understands me.

1442
01:21:23,180 --> 01:21:24,463
- Poor Neville Chamberlain,

1443
01:21:24,463 --> 01:21:26,262
to believe he could trust Hitler,

1444
01:21:26,262 --> 01:21:27,095
he was wrong,

1445
01:21:27,095 --> 01:21:29,886
I don't think I'm wrong about Stalin.

1446
01:21:29,886 --> 01:21:33,553
Franklin has such a
slender contact on life.

1447
01:21:44,545 --> 01:21:46,962
Peace with Germany and Japan.

1448
01:21:48,753 --> 01:21:49,836
On our terms,

1449
01:21:52,549 --> 01:21:55,249
will not bring much rest to you and me,

1450
01:21:55,249 --> 01:21:57,332
if I'm still responsible.

1451
01:21:59,499 --> 01:22:02,382
When the war of the giants is over,

1452
01:22:02,382 --> 01:22:05,094
the war of the pygmies will begin,

1453
01:22:05,094 --> 01:22:06,210
it will be a torn,

1454
01:22:06,210 --> 01:22:10,204
ragged and hungry world help to its feet,

1455
01:22:10,204 --> 01:22:11,904
and what will uncle Joe or his successor

1456
01:22:11,904 --> 01:22:16,071
say to the way we should
should both like to do it?

1457
01:22:20,760 --> 01:22:23,137
Now that Harry is ill,

1458
01:22:23,137 --> 01:22:25,970
my poor friend is very much alone,

1459
01:22:27,396 --> 01:22:30,208
and according to all accounts I received,

1460
01:22:30,208 --> 01:22:32,541
bereft of much of his vigor.

1461
01:22:35,246 --> 01:22:37,079
- The work my friends,

1462
01:22:38,417 --> 01:22:39,250
is peace,

1463
01:22:41,702 --> 01:22:44,567
more than the end of this war,

1464
01:22:44,567 --> 01:22:47,650
the end of the beginning of all wars,

1465
01:22:48,505 --> 01:22:51,838
yes the end forever of this impractical,

1466
01:22:53,115 --> 01:22:55,682
unrealistic settlement and the differences

1467
01:22:55,682 --> 01:22:59,849
between governments by the
mass killing of peoples.

1468
01:23:01,050 --> 01:23:02,720
And to you,

1469
01:23:02,720 --> 01:23:06,064
and to all Americans
who dedicate themselves

1470
01:23:06,064 --> 01:23:09,713
with us to the making of an abiding peace,

1471
01:23:09,713 --> 01:23:13,880
I say the only limit to our
realization of tomorrow,

1472
01:23:17,004 --> 01:23:18,921
is our doubts of today,

1473
01:23:20,048 --> 01:23:21,715
let us move forward,

1474
01:23:22,692 --> 01:23:25,109
with strong and active faith.

1475
01:23:45,651 --> 01:23:47,901
I have a terrific headache.

1476
01:24:01,183 --> 01:24:04,350
(train whistle blows)

1477
01:24:15,242 --> 01:24:18,634
- [Churchill] In Franklin Roosevelt,

1478
01:24:18,634 --> 01:24:22,801
there died the greatest American
friend we have ever known,

1479
01:24:24,412 --> 01:24:27,548
and the greatest champion of freedom

1480
01:24:27,548 --> 01:24:30,256
who was ever brought help and comfort

1481
01:24:30,256 --> 01:24:32,756
from the New World to the old.

1482
01:24:34,414 --> 01:24:37,602
- [Stalin] President Roosevelt has died,

1483
01:24:37,602 --> 01:24:39,852
but his cause must live on.

1484
01:24:40,963 --> 01:24:44,796
- I have lost a dear and
cherished friendship,

1485
01:24:45,908 --> 01:24:48,908
which was forged in the fire of war.

1486
01:24:59,464 --> 01:25:00,297
Oh Harry,

1487
01:25:03,100 --> 01:25:07,267
I understand how deep your
feelings of grief must be.

1488
01:25:23,359 --> 01:25:26,589
- [Narrator] Radio Moscow reported today,

1489
01:25:26,589 --> 01:25:28,287
that the encirclement of Berlin has

1490
01:25:28,287 --> 01:25:30,045
been in completed near Kotzen,

1491
01:25:30,045 --> 01:25:32,189
and the reporter said a steel band

1492
01:25:32,189 --> 01:25:34,527
is being drawn ever tighter On Germany's--

1493
01:25:34,527 --> 01:25:37,300
- [Announcer] The final
assault on Berlin had begun,

1494
01:25:37,300 --> 01:25:39,292
two million Soviet soldiers under generals

1495
01:25:39,292 --> 01:25:43,381
Konev and Zhukov behind
6000 tanks and six--

1496
01:25:43,381 --> 01:25:44,555
- [Narrator] Here is a bulletin,

1497
01:25:44,555 --> 01:25:46,446
German sources inside the beleaguered

1498
01:25:46,446 --> 01:25:49,197
city of Berlin report that Adolf Hitler

1499
01:25:49,197 --> 01:25:51,974
has committed suicide in his bunker,

1500
01:25:51,974 --> 01:25:54,266
repeat according to German sources

1501
01:25:54,266 --> 01:25:58,349
Adolf Hitler has committed
suicide in his bunker.

1502
01:26:08,233 --> 01:26:09,961
- Yesterday morning,

1503
01:26:09,961 --> 01:26:10,878
at 2:41 AM,

1504
01:26:12,380 --> 01:26:14,219
at headquarters,

1505
01:26:14,219 --> 01:26:18,386
General Jodl representative
of the German High Command,

1506
01:26:19,998 --> 01:26:22,247
and grand Admiral Doenitz,

1507
01:26:22,247 --> 01:26:25,903
the designated head of the German state,

1508
01:26:25,903 --> 01:26:29,429
signed the act of unconditional surrender

1509
01:26:29,429 --> 01:26:32,585
of all German land, sea and air forces

1510
01:26:32,585 --> 01:26:36,865
in Europe to the Allied
expeditionary forces,

1511
01:26:36,865 --> 01:26:40,677
and simultaneously to
the Soviet high command.

1512
01:26:40,677 --> 01:26:44,258
(crowd cheers and applauds)

1513
01:26:44,258 --> 01:26:47,323
- The day of the great victory has begun.

1514
01:26:47,323 --> 01:26:50,990
(crowd cheers and applauds)

1515
01:26:53,815 --> 01:26:56,133
the great sacrifices that we have made

1516
01:26:56,133 --> 01:27:00,300
in the name of freedom and
the defense of our motherland,

1517
01:27:01,983 --> 01:27:04,667
incalculable suffering and privations

1518
01:27:04,667 --> 01:27:08,834
experienced by our people
during the course of the war,

1519
01:27:09,752 --> 01:27:13,919
has been crowned by complete
victory over the enemy.

1520
01:27:18,838 --> 01:27:20,607
- God bless you all,

1521
01:27:20,607 --> 01:27:22,450
this is your victory,

1522
01:27:22,450 --> 01:27:26,617
this is a victory to the cause
of freedom in every land,

1523
01:27:28,339 --> 01:27:30,497
in our long history we have never

1524
01:27:30,497 --> 01:27:32,747
had as great a day as this.

1525
01:27:41,346 --> 01:27:44,336
I send you heartfelt
greetings Marshal Stalin,

1526
01:27:44,336 --> 01:27:45,723
from the splendid victory you have

1527
01:27:45,723 --> 01:27:47,648
one in driving the invader from your

1528
01:27:47,648 --> 01:27:50,648
soil and laying the Nazi tyrant low.

1529
01:27:51,913 --> 01:27:53,829
- I salute you Prime Minister

1530
01:27:53,829 --> 01:27:56,304
and congratulate you cordially

1531
01:27:56,304 --> 01:27:59,971
on this great victory
over our common enemy.

1532
01:28:01,476 --> 01:28:04,726
(church bells ringing)

1533
01:28:08,161 --> 01:28:11,078
(triumphant music)

1534
01:28:17,639 --> 01:28:20,806
(fireworks exploding)

1535
01:28:53,786 --> 01:28:56,536
- What is to happen about Russia?

1536
01:28:58,686 --> 01:29:01,766
I have always worked for
friendship with Russia,

1537
01:29:01,766 --> 01:29:04,486
but I feel deep anxiety because

1538
01:29:04,486 --> 01:29:07,930
of their misinterpretations
of the allied decisions,

1539
01:29:07,930 --> 01:29:10,567
their attitude towards Poland,

1540
01:29:10,567 --> 01:29:14,234
their overwhelming
influence in the Balkans,

1541
01:29:15,438 --> 01:29:17,958
the combination of Russian power

1542
01:29:17,958 --> 01:29:21,611
and the territories under their control,

1543
01:29:21,611 --> 01:29:24,796
above all they have power to maintain

1544
01:29:24,796 --> 01:29:28,713
very large armies in the
field for a long time,

1545
01:29:30,509 --> 01:29:34,092
what will be the position
in a year or two,

1546
01:29:35,425 --> 01:29:39,508
when the British and
American armies have melted?

1547
01:29:40,478 --> 01:29:43,525
When Russia may choose to keep 200

1548
01:29:43,525 --> 01:29:45,858
divisions on active service?

1549
01:29:48,307 --> 01:29:51,307
An iron curtain is being drawn down,

1550
01:29:52,838 --> 01:29:56,255
and we don't know what's going on behind.

1551
01:30:00,956 --> 01:30:03,873
(melancholy music)

1552
01:30:44,094 --> 01:30:46,413
- Surely if the soldiers
of the United States,

1553
01:30:46,413 --> 01:30:49,447
Britain and the Soviet Union,

1554
01:30:49,447 --> 01:30:52,303
can fight together and win
a glorious military victory,

1555
01:30:52,303 --> 01:30:55,303
and indeed in spite of every difficulty,

1556
01:30:55,303 --> 01:30:56,907
the allied statesman will create

1557
01:30:56,907 --> 01:31:00,157
the basis for a just and lasting peace.

1558
01:31:42,655 --> 01:31:46,155
(dramatic military music)
