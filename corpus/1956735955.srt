77
00:05:23,279 --> 00:05:27,065
paid a bunch male hookers
to cum into a plastic bag.

78
00:05:27,109 --> 00:05:29,590
Then he dumped in some body
that left on the side of the
ten.

00:05:32,201 --> 00:05:36,161
How the fuck do you know that?

80

you admitted a
caucasian female, late twenties,

red hair, named Carey Andrews.

171
00:09:31,962 --> 00:09:33,268
Yes we did.

172
00:09:33,311 --> 00:09:35,183
She's part of
a criminal investigation.

173
00:09:35,226 --> 00:09:38,142
I need to talk to her. Is she
conscience, can she communicate?

174
00:09:38,186 --> 00:09:41,668
-Yeah, but you don't want to.
-That's, it doesn't
work that way. I'm sorry.

175
00:09:41,711 --> 00:09:44,366
[smug]
It doesn't? And who are you?

176
00:09:44,409 --> 00:09:47,108
I'm Dr. Jessy Metcalf, agent.
I'll be working with you on
this case?

177
00:09:47,151 --> 00:09:49,458

You're Metcalf!

178
00:09:49,501 --> 00:09:51,199
Yeah, I didn't recognize you
without the TV cameras around.

179
00:09:51,242 --> 00:09:52,156
-Doc, that's room two fifteen,
right?

180
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:53,201
-Downstairs, good luck.

181
00:09:55,246 --> 00:09:58,336
-I'll be in my office.
-Okay, I'll be right there,
Dr. Chase.

182
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:00,338
Excuse me Agent Belasco.

183
00:10:00,382 --> 00:10:02,166
Um, I don't want to start off
on the wrong foot.

184
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:03,559
[stern]
Really? Then why did you
steal my case?

185
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,213
[calm voice]
Okay, I didn't steal your case.

186
00:10:05,256 --> 00:10:07,215
I want to catch this guy
just as much as you do.

187
00:10:07,258 --> 00:10:09,739
But, she's very fragile
right now and it could

188
00:10:09,783 --> 00:10:11,654
take weeks before I get
any information from her.

189
00:10:11,698 --> 00:10:13,482
[growing angry]
We don't have weeks.

190
00:10:13,525 --> 00:10:16,659
-Well, you'll have to trust me
that she...
-Trust you? Trust you?

191
00:10:16,703 --> 00:10:18,705
[angry]
You keep a witness locked up
for two weeks,

192
00:10:18,748 --> 00:10:20,924
without notifying my office,

193
00:10:20,968 --> 00:10:23,274
and you take my evidence
and lock it up in your lab?

194
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:27,017
[defensive]
-Wow, I'm not going to audition
my credentials for you--
-Well you have to!

195
00:10:27,061 --> 00:10:28,410
[yelling]
Cause why would I trust you?

196
00:10:28,453 --> 00:10:30,107
[angry]
You know what?

197
00:10:30,151 --> 00:10:32,675
She is fragile, she has
been held captive by a man--

198
00:10:32,719 --> 00:10:34,198
and been raped
and tortured for years!

199
00:10:34,242 --> 00:10:37,549
Imagine the walls that she's
erected just to survive!

200
00:10:37,593 --> 00:10:39,377
You go in there
the way you are now

201
00:10:39,421 --> 00:10:41,553
she's going to shut down and
never open up again!

202
00:10:41,597 --> 00:10:43,599
[calming down]
Look, I want to help you!

203
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:48,952
Just tell me what I can do!

204
00:10:48,996 --> 00:10:50,475
I need details!

205
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:53,478
I need to know,
sights, sounds, smells!

206
00:10:53,522 --> 00:10:57,004
I need to know everything
she felt, what she thought!

207
00:10:57,047 --> 00:11:00,572
What the room looked like!
Details! I need details!

208
00:11:00,616 --> 00:11:01,661
-Okay--
-Get them on tape!

209
00:11:01,704 --> 00:11:03,793
I'll do what I can!

210
00:11:03,837 --> 00:11:07,318
And um...I heard that there was
a package delivered to you.
His journal.

211
00:11:07,362 --> 00:11:09,669
Call Mayor Abrams.
He's know we are working

212
00:11:09,712 --> 00:11:13,585
together on the case, tell him
to release that evidence
into your custody.

213
00:11:13,629 --> 00:11:16,153
Read over it, and then I'll ring
you when I leave here,

214
00:11:16,197 --> 00:11:18,199
we can go over
what you found out.

215
00:11:21,724 --> 00:11:23,378
[insincere]
Yeah. Thank you. Jeez...

216
00:11:23,421 --> 00:11:25,075
that's-that's really big of you!
Thanks very much!

217
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:29,079
[to her self]
Nice to meet you Agent.

218
00:11:29,123 --> 00:11:33,127
[dark scary music]

219
00:11:37,218 --> 00:11:40,525
[sinister laughter]

220
00:11:40,569 --> 00:11:43,050
Ghost:
Oh. I'm so silly sometimes.

221
00:11:47,576 --> 00:11:48,577
Oh. Wait a minute.

222
00:11:48,620 --> 00:11:50,622
[sawing flesh]
[screams]

223
00:11:52,581 --> 00:11:55,627
[woman moaning in pain]

224
00:11:55,671 --> 00:11:58,674
Ghost:
oh. I don't want you
to feel any pain.

225
00:11:59,675 --> 00:12:02,460
[nurturing]
Be hurting.

226
00:12:02,504 --> 00:12:06,464
That would be mean.

227
00:12:06,508 --> 00:12:08,597
[whispering softly]
I don't want to be mean to you.

228
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:10,686
You rest here.

229
00:12:10,730 --> 00:12:12,209
[nurturing]
Just rest.

230
00:12:15,082 --> 00:12:19,086
[squeaky door]
[tense music]

231
00:12:30,010 --> 00:12:31,141
Hello, Carey.

232
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:34,841
[stern]
Shut the door!

233
00:12:34,884 --> 00:12:37,495
[shouting]
Shut the door!

234
00:12:37,539 --> 00:12:39,541
[gentle]
We agreed that
I would keep it open.

235
00:12:43,197 --> 00:12:46,026
I don't think it's fair, that
you can see me and I can't see
you.

236
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:53,773
[patronizing]
There. Now, it's fair.

237
00:12:56,863 --> 00:12:58,038
Carey.

238
00:12:59,387 --> 00:13:00,867
Please, just try.

239
00:13:04,784 --> 00:13:08,265
Dr. Chase, said that your
sister Megan came by to see you.

240
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:10,572
On the 16th.

241
00:13:11,878 --> 00:13:13,357
Today's the 17th.

242
00:13:14,532 --> 00:13:16,839
I know. I count the days.

243
00:13:20,538 --> 00:13:21,539
[softly]
But, you don't have to
count the days Carey.

244
00:13:21,583 --> 00:13:23,063
You're not there anymore.

245
00:13:26,893 --> 00:13:28,546
[lucid]
In some ways, I still am.

246
00:13:33,421 --> 00:13:36,554
[whispering]
He liked that.

247
00:13:36,598 --> 00:13:39,557
That I could count days.

248
00:13:39,601 --> 00:13:42,517
Keep a mental record of events.

249
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:45,694
How long they lasted.

250
00:13:45,737 --> 00:13:47,739
When the new
stock would come in.

251
00:13:51,439 --> 00:13:52,832
Only one more day.

252
00:13:55,704 --> 00:13:58,576
Amber M. is added to the list.

253
00:13:58,620 --> 00:14:02,580
She's so young.

254
00:14:02,624 --> 00:14:04,844
She won't last long.

255
00:14:04,887 --> 00:14:07,063
Who's Amber M?

256
00:14:07,107 --> 00:14:10,632
[thinking]
Been watching her for
over a year now.

257
00:14:10,675 --> 00:14:14,157
With the sliver in the closet
where he kept me some nights.

258
00:14:14,723 --> 00:14:16,943
[thinking]
I could see him...

259
00:14:16,986 --> 00:14:19,293
watching the footage
he taped of her.

260
00:14:19,336 --> 00:14:20,555
Undressing.

261
00:14:22,165 --> 00:14:24,167
-Painting her toe nails.
-[heavy breathing ]

262
00:14:26,213 --> 00:14:27,388
Ghost:
Yeah, that's it.
Touching herself.

263
00:14:27,431 --> 00:14:30,086
Ghost:
That's it.Yeah.

264
00:14:30,130 --> 00:14:32,480
He'd fight to keep it hard.
But...

265
00:14:32,523 --> 00:14:34,525
[matter of fact]
Eventually he'd cum!

266
00:14:37,093 --> 00:14:39,095
And pull me out of the closet
to lick it off him.

267
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:48,844
Ghost:
Yeah. I'm getting close.
I'm close baby.

268
00:14:48,888 --> 00:14:50,498
Yeah! Yeah!

269
00:14:52,848 --> 00:14:55,329
[choking]
Uh. Uh. Uuuuhhh!

270
00:14:58,071 --> 00:15:00,595
[gasping]
Uhhh. Uhhh.

271
00:15:14,435 --> 00:15:16,916
[whimpering]
She's not a whore.

272
00:15:18,526 --> 00:15:20,136
[yelling]
Not like you!

273
00:15:20,180 --> 00:15:22,704
[whispering]
I really care.

274
00:15:32,540 --> 00:15:35,717
[sweet voice]
You're so, so, beautiful baby.

275
00:15:35,760 --> 00:15:37,762
[gentle]
So. Here. No, no. It's okay.

276
00:15:39,895 --> 00:15:43,812
It's like lip, lip gloss.
Make's your lips so shiny.

277
00:15:46,554 --> 00:15:50,514
[giggling]
You look so, so beautiful
right now. You know.

278
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:51,515
You look beautiful.

279
00:15:51,559 --> 00:15:53,256
[yellling]
You fucking whore!

280
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:57,260
[angry]
You fucking whore!

281
00:15:57,304 --> 00:15:59,654
[threatening]
I'm going to deal with you
later.

282
00:15:59,697 --> 00:16:02,178
[screaming]
I'll deal with you later!

283
00:16:04,833 --> 00:16:08,793
Dr. Metcalf:
Carey is there anything you can
remember about her?

284
00:16:08,837 --> 00:16:11,971
That might help us. What does
Amber M. look like?

285
00:16:12,014 --> 00:16:14,974
[annoyed]
She looks like any other
missing girl in her 20's.

286
00:16:17,324 --> 00:16:18,847
Average length of hair.

287
00:16:20,327 --> 00:16:21,850
Average height.

288
00:16:22,416 --> 00:16:23,939
Average weight.

289
00:16:28,248 --> 00:16:29,510
Average.

290
00:16:31,033 --> 00:16:32,513
The perfect target.

291
00:16:36,038 --> 00:16:38,910
Was there anything on the
footage

292
00:16:38,954 --> 00:16:40,956
that might give us insight into
her location?

293
00:16:43,089 --> 00:16:45,221
Anything he might have said?

294
00:16:45,265 --> 00:16:47,267
I was bound inside of a closet.

295
00:16:50,531 --> 00:16:52,054
Bound.

296
00:16:52,098 --> 00:16:55,797
So tight, my fingers burned and
felt like they'd fall off.

297
00:16:56,493 --> 00:16:59,583
My insides were raw,

298
00:16:59,627 --> 00:17:03,413
from him shoving whatever was
within reach inside of me.

299
00:17:03,457 --> 00:17:04,501
The hour previous.

300
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:05,459
And I knew what was coming.

301
00:17:09,811 --> 00:17:10,986
Tasting him.

302
00:17:12,814 --> 00:17:14,337
Praying this time I wouldn't
throw up, so I could get shut
back up

303
00:17:14,381 --> 00:17:18,385
for a little while and not be
beaten until a bone would snap!

304
00:17:21,953 --> 00:17:24,956
Amber M. wasn't the top of my
priority list.

305
00:17:34,923 --> 00:17:36,403
I'm sorry Carey.

306
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:40,537
You're safe now.

307
00:17:40,842 --> 00:17:42,844
[ laughing ]

308
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:48,110
Carey, I'm sorry.

309
00:17:51,418 --> 00:17:52,549
What's funny?

310
00:17:58,642 --> 00:17:59,861
Funny.

311
00:18:02,646 --> 00:18:03,865
Dis...

312
00:18:04,648 --> 00:18:05,867
Connected.

313
00:18:12,656 --> 00:18:13,875
I counted...

314
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:16,704
how long she'd last.

315
00:18:19,185 --> 00:18:20,708
What he'd do to her.

316
00:18:27,671 --> 00:18:29,325
She wouldn't last very long.

317
00:18:33,068 --> 00:18:35,070
I still have your pictures if
you need them back.

318
00:18:37,203 --> 00:18:38,378
Okay.

319
00:19:07,276 --> 00:19:08,538
12 days.

320
00:19:09,365 --> 00:19:10,584
16 days.

321
00:19:13,413 --> 00:19:14,588
12 days.

322
00:19:16,938 --> 00:19:18,157
16 days.

323
00:19:18,548 --> 00:19:19,767
9 days.

324
00:19:20,550 --> 00:19:21,769
20 days.

325
00:19:23,553 --> 00:19:25,076
4 days. 3 days. 2 days.

326
00:19:26,600 --> 00:19:28,123
18 days. 7 days.

327
00:19:29,907 --> 00:19:31,126
21 days.

328
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:34,390
4 days.

329
00:19:35,261 --> 00:19:36,436
8 days.

330
00:19:37,915 --> 00:19:39,134
20 days.

331
00:19:41,441 --> 00:19:42,616
3 days.

332
00:19:43,573 --> 00:19:44,792
6 days.

333
00:19:46,272 --> 00:19:48,274
Do you recognize all these
girls?

334
00:19:52,321 --> 00:19:53,627
6

335
00:19:53,670 --> 00:19:54,889
Days.

336
00:19:58,022 --> 00:19:59,198
6 days

337
00:20:00,329 --> 00:20:01,548
6 days.

338
00:20:02,026 --> 00:20:03,245
What?

339
00:20:03,289 --> 00:20:04,725
That's how long you'll last.

340
00:20:05,943 --> 00:20:07,162
6 days.

341
00:20:08,424 --> 00:20:09,643
6 days.

342
00:20:10,861 --> 00:20:12,080
6 days.

343
00:20:13,342 --> 00:20:14,561
You're safe now.

344
00:20:16,606 --> 00:20:20,610
Go away 6 days. Go away.

345
00:21:12,053 --> 00:21:16,013
[ crying ]

346
00:21:16,057 --> 00:21:20,061
[ominous tone]

347
00:21:41,082 --> 00:21:42,257
Becca.

348
00:21:44,825 --> 00:21:46,087
Becca.

349
00:21:47,480 --> 00:21:49,090
Gina:
You want him to come back.

350
00:21:49,133 --> 00:21:50,700
Aren't you sore enough.

351
00:21:50,744 --> 00:21:52,223

3 years that Carey
was under his control.

697
00:43:28,562 --> 00:43:30,520
[angry]
I mean, I mean it makes me
fucking crazy.

698
00:43:30,564 --> 00:43:32,044
[shouting]
So don't do it!

699
00:43:37,049 --> 00:43:39,704
[sweetly]
You know, I butchered my
grandmother in this very tub.

700
00:43:39,747 --> 00:43:43,055
[screaming]

701
00:43:43,098 --> 00:43:45,840
[struggling]
Ah.

702
00:43:45,884 --> 00:43:48,887
That's what she did.
[mocking]
Wah-wah-wah.

703
00:43:51,237 --> 00:43:52,368
Alright.

704
00:44:03,249 --> 00:44:07,209
[stern]
Now you got my hair wet.

705
00:44:07,253 --> 00:44:09,734
I don't like when
my hair gets wet.

706
00:44:13,825 --> 00:44:16,349
I'm going to move the
bucket over there.

707
00:44:18,743 --> 00:44:21,267
I'm going to show you what I do
with this.

708
00:44:22,921 --> 00:44:25,880
Trust me,
it's not a nipple adjuster.

709
00:44:25,924 --> 00:44:27,882
[whispering]
I don't understand.

710
00:44:27,926 --> 00:44:29,884
[sweetly]
I'm going to pull
your teeth out,

711
00:44:29,928 --> 00:44:33,583
through this chicken wire one
at a time.

712
00:44:33,627 --> 00:44:36,064
Hold your head under the water
to you're just about dead.

713
00:44:36,108 --> 00:44:37,457
And then..

714
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:41,853
Pull you back up.

715
00:44:41,896 --> 00:44:44,159
While I yank your tooth out of
your fucking skull.

716
00:44:44,203 --> 00:44:48,163
[angry]
Splash that water
one more time in my face!

717
00:44:48,207 --> 00:44:49,425
Go ahead.

718
00:44:51,645 --> 00:44:54,648
[shouting]
-Do it!
-[screams]

719
00:44:56,258 --> 00:44:57,738
[stern]
I didn't think so.

720
00:45:01,786 --> 00:45:04,310
[crying]
I want my mom.

721
00:45:04,353 --> 00:45:06,355
[mocking]
You want your mom?

722
00:45:06,399 --> 00:45:08,357
[crying]
I want my mom!

723
00:45:08,401 --> 00:45:09,968
[sweetly]
I know, I know, but don't beg.

724
00:45:12,448 --> 00:45:14,929
Don't beg. Please, cause I hate
begging so much

725
00:45:16,496 --> 00:45:18,454
[growing angry]
it runs right through me,
through my fucking head

726
00:45:18,498 --> 00:45:20,456
and into my spinal cord.

727
00:45:20,500 --> 00:45:23,503
It feels like I'm being
electrocuted when someone
does it.

728
00:45:24,547 --> 00:45:27,376
[sweetly]
You don't want to electrocute
me, do you?

729
00:45:27,420 --> 00:45:28,508
[whispering]
No.

730
00:45:28,551 --> 00:45:31,293
Then I'll put Mr. Teefer away.

731
00:45:31,337 --> 00:45:33,513
If you're a good girl.

732
00:45:33,556 --> 00:45:34,732
Okay.

733
00:45:36,516 --> 00:45:38,039
[whispering]
He's right up there.

734
00:45:38,083 --> 00:45:40,302
Are you thirsty still? Here!

735
00:45:40,346 --> 00:45:41,608
[dramatic music]

736
00:45:41,651 --> 00:45:44,480
He got here didn't he? Amber M.

737
00:45:44,524 --> 00:45:46,787
We didn't get to her in time.

738
00:45:46,831 --> 00:45:48,833
Hmmm. He's got it
down to a science.

739
00:45:50,922 --> 00:45:53,098
Perfect timing.

740
00:45:53,141 --> 00:45:55,317
But we can still save her.

741
00:45:55,361 --> 00:45:57,842
Look you were there,
where he held you.

742
00:45:59,408 --> 00:46:01,889
Tell me what you
remember about it.

743
00:46:03,499 --> 00:46:05,501
There was this girl, Kim.

744
00:46:07,547 --> 00:46:08,722
So young.

745
00:46:11,594 --> 00:46:15,163
[thinking]
She, she lasted longer
than most.

746
00:46:15,207 --> 00:46:17,818
Which isn't long at all.

747
00:46:17,862 --> 00:46:19,385
25 days in all.

748
00:46:23,868 --> 00:46:27,828
She told me about it after
she'd been gone from the
basement.

749
00:46:30,222 --> 00:46:31,745
[thinking]
I was sick.

750
00:46:33,529 --> 00:46:36,706
I remember her, cradling me.

751
00:46:36,750 --> 00:46:38,752
While I vomited uncontrollably
on her hand.

752
00:46:40,754 --> 00:46:43,757
Shaking. Then blackness.

753
00:46:46,107 --> 00:46:47,630
He must have taken her then.

754
00:46:50,198 --> 00:46:52,592
She said she didn't go far,

755
00:46:52,635 --> 00:46:54,855
between the basement
and this place.

756
00:46:54,899 --> 00:46:56,814
Maybe a mile.

757
00:46:56,857 --> 00:46:57,815
He struck her!

758
00:46:57,858 --> 00:46:58,859
[ hammer hit ]

759
00:46:58,903 --> 00:46:59,904
To knock her out.

760
00:47:00,905 --> 00:47:03,646
But, she faked
being unconscious.

761
00:47:03,690 --> 00:47:07,650
Just in case she had a chance
to run.

762
00:47:07,694 --> 00:47:11,654
She tried, when he
opened the truck.

763
00:47:11,698 --> 00:47:14,179
But, he struck her...

764
00:47:14,222 --> 00:47:15,745
then she was inside.

765
00:47:20,750 --> 00:47:22,752
[coughing]

766
00:47:49,344 --> 00:47:51,346
[crying]
I'm Kim.

767
00:48:01,400 --> 00:48:03,271
[whispering]
Hey.

768
00:48:03,315 --> 00:48:05,360
[crying]

769
00:48:05,404 --> 00:48:06,884
Shhhhh. Shhhh.

770
00:48:11,366 --> 00:48:13,455
It's okay. It's okay.

771
00:48:13,499 --> 00:48:15,457
It's okay.

772
00:48:15,501 --> 00:48:17,459
Black Girl:
No, it's not.

773
00:48:17,503 --> 00:48:21,463
[crying]
You didn't see what
he did to her.

774
00:48:21,507 --> 00:48:23,509
[crying]
In front of me.

775
00:48:31,386 --> 00:48:33,388
[crying]
I can still smell him in here.

776
00:48:35,390 --> 00:48:37,392
[crying]
He beat her face.

777
00:48:38,393 --> 00:48:40,395
[crying]
He wouldn't stop.

778
00:48:44,182 --> 00:48:47,837
Then he took jars of rotten meat

779
00:48:47,881 --> 00:48:49,883
and he stuffed them
inside of her.

780
00:48:51,885 --> 00:48:54,888
[crying]
He packed her like
a fucking turkey.

781
00:48:57,935 --> 00:48:59,675
[crying]
Then he took fishing line and
he sewed her up.

782
00:48:59,719 --> 00:49:02,504
[crying]
And she's still alive.

783
00:49:02,548 --> 00:49:05,029
[crying]
She's still fucking alive

784
00:49:05,594 --> 00:49:06,813
and he's coming back.

785
00:49:08,293 --> 00:49:09,555
He's coming back.

786
00:49:10,556 --> 00:49:12,036
He's coming back for you.

787
00:49:16,214 --> 00:49:20,218
[crying]
No, that can't, I've never been
with anybody before.

788
00:49:25,745 --> 00:49:29,705
[angry]
He can't do this!

789
00:49:29,749 --> 00:49:33,753
[begging]
God. Please.

790
00:49:37,757 --> 00:49:39,889
[crying]
He can't take that away from me.

791
00:49:39,933 --> 00:49:42,414
[crying]
He can't, he can't do that.

792
00:49:47,941 --> 00:49:51,945
It's not supposed
to hurt like that.

793
00:49:53,033 --> 00:49:54,513
And I, and I...

794
00:49:56,167 --> 00:49:58,169
It's supposed to be
somebody special.

795
00:50:00,171 --> 00:50:02,216
It's supposed to be beautiful.

796
00:50:06,046 --> 00:50:09,006
I'm supposed to feel beautiful.

797
00:50:10,094 --> 00:50:14,054
Black Girl:
[ crying ]
I'm sorry.

798
00:50:14,098 --> 00:50:15,273
Oh, no.

799
00:50:20,539 --> 00:50:24,369
Kim:
[crying]
I can't, I can't do it.

800
00:50:24,412 --> 00:50:26,066
[woman screaming]

801
00:50:26,110 --> 00:50:29,113
He can't do that to me. He
can't take that away...

802
00:50:36,555 --> 00:50:40,515
[screams]

803
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:44,258
Kim:
Shhhhh.

804
00:50:44,302 --> 00:50:45,607

He's gonna come back!

[dramatic sting]
[screams]
[crying]

809
00:51:05,714 --> 00:51:07,716
She never told me what
he did to her.

810
00:51:09,805 --> 00:51:11,894
I found out afterwards.

811
00:51:11,938 --> 00:51:15,942
[dark music]

812
00:52:11,519 --> 00:52:13,521
See we told you last time.

813
00:52:13,565 --> 00:52:17,525
And we told you,
and we told you, we told,
and we told you.

814
00:52:17,569 --> 00:52:19,092
And you didn't listen.

815
00:52:24,053 --> 00:52:26,012
Ghost:
Pull her arms back tight!

816
00:52:26,055 --> 00:52:28,057
[shouting]
No, no, no!

817
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:29,581

No, no, no, don't say no.

Please, please.

-Please.
-Listen, listen, listen, listen.

822
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:47,033

Say, please.

[crying]
Please.

824
00:52:49,427 --> 00:52:52,125
-I like when you say it really
softly. Shhhhh. Listen, listen,
listen so you get it right.

825
00:52:52,169 --> 00:52:56,129
Please, like a lot of
air out of your mouth.

826
00:52:56,173 --> 00:52:58,610
You can do it. No, look at me
again.

827
00:52:58,653 --> 00:53:01,090
Watch, watch, watch. Please.

828
00:53:01,134 --> 00:53:03,092
Like that, only wider.

829
00:53:03,136 --> 00:53:05,138
No, like wide open with
your mouth.
-Please.

00:53:05,182 --> 00:53:08,185
-Please. That's it.
-Please.

Don't, don't. It's okay, it's
okay. Shhhh.

833
00:53:25,506 --> 00:53:29,467
Here you go. Now your starting
to loose consciousness.

834
00:53:29,510 --> 00:53:33,514
Starting to loose
consciousness, and soon you get
to go home.

835
00:53:34,646 --> 00:53:36,648
Up to heaven, where all the
angels go.

836
00:53:38,737 --> 00:53:42,697
All the angels go to heaven.
All the angels go to heaven.

Gone. She's gone.

00:53:53,360 --> 00:53:54,579
She's gone Newt.

00:53:57,538 --> 00:54:00,541
[sad]
I know buddy. I know buddy.

841
00:54:03,414 --> 00:54:05,807
But you know.

842
00:54:05,851 --> 00:54:09,637
Sometimes, we have to send
them home, Newt.

843
00:54:09,681 --> 00:54:12,466
Sometimes, we take them home.

844
00:54:12,510 --> 00:54:14,512
Eventually we send them home.

845
00:54:18,385 --> 00:54:20,474
Well, you know what Newt.

846
00:54:20,518 --> 00:54:23,825
I'm going to give you...

847
00:54:23,869 --> 00:54:25,871
one of your
favorite little treats.

God I love that red light.
So sexy.

Here's what I'm gonna do Newt.

850
00:54:40,059 --> 00:54:43,018
I'm going to give you 5
minutes...

851
00:54:43,062 --> 00:54:46,065
I don't think it's going to
take you more than 30 seconds.

852
00:54:46,108 --> 00:54:49,416
I don't want to say that to
anybody else but you.

853
00:54:50,243 --> 00:54:54,116
You do have the family
tradition to keep up Newt.

854
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:58,120
You take your 5 minutes and you
do your thing Newt.

855
00:54:58,164 --> 00:55:01,167
You give to her good. Okay,
buddy.

down, come down, come on.

all for the Newt.

Alright Newt, you go ride that
kid. Alright.

862
00:55:27,411 --> 00:55:29,238
Yee-haw cowboy, don't take too
long now.

863

Keep the family name going.

Don't shoot it yet bud.

00:55:41,033 --> 00:55:43,035
Newt:
[grunting]

868
00:55:48,954 --> 00:55:52,653
[stern]
She was strong.

869
00:55:52,697 --> 00:55:53,915
Kept it all inside.

870
00:56:00,444 --> 00:56:03,403
She said..

871
00:56:03,447 --> 00:56:05,405
She saw a partial
street sign

872
00:56:05,449 --> 00:56:07,886
when they pulled her
from the truck.

873
00:56:07,929 --> 00:56:11,846
[thinking]
P-I-C avenue. N-A-N avenue.

874
00:56:15,110 --> 00:56:17,112
[sweetly]
Just the ends.

875
00:56:25,469 --> 00:56:27,862
Carey.

876
00:56:27,906 --> 00:56:30,299
I'm really sorry
about your friend.

877
00:56:30,343 --> 00:56:33,825
I really am.

878
00:56:33,868 --> 00:56:37,829
And I'm going to make
him pay for this.

879
00:56:37,872 --> 00:56:39,396
If it's the last thing I do.

880
00:56:49,144 --> 00:56:50,363
Goodbye Dr.

881
00:56:54,802 --> 00:56:58,806
[dark tone music]

882
00:56:59,677 --> 00:57:02,680
[moaning]

883
00:57:12,516 --> 00:57:13,691
Sick fuck.

884
00:57:20,524 --> 00:57:23,831
-Look at that.
-What?

885
00:57:23,875 --> 00:57:25,659
The corner, see that.

886
00:57:25,703 --> 00:57:27,792
See that white square on top of
that machinery.

887
00:57:27,835 --> 00:57:29,620
Yeah.

888
00:57:29,663 --> 00:57:31,143
That is a service record.

889
00:57:31,186 --> 00:57:33,319
See that line right there,
that's for service dates.

890
00:57:33,362 --> 00:57:35,495
There's repairman signatures.

891
00:57:35,539 --> 00:57:37,410
Tom, we blow this,

892
00:57:37,454 --> 00:57:39,325
we blow this frame up we got a
gold mine here.

893
00:57:39,368 --> 00:57:40,500
We take all this information
and

894
00:57:40,544 --> 00:57:42,807
run it through the
company records

895
00:57:42,850 --> 00:57:45,505
and we'll find out exatcly
where this place is.

896
00:57:45,549 --> 00:57:48,334
Now that logo, what is that,
that's an e.

897
00:57:48,377 --> 00:57:49,901
E? Is it?

898
00:57:49,944 --> 00:57:52,730
Edwards electric, my old man
worked for them for 20 years.

899
00:57:52,773 --> 00:57:54,558
It's now part of Cal-Ed.

900
00:57:54,601 --> 00:57:55,689
Exactly what it is.

901
00:57:55,733 --> 00:57:57,517
Good work.

902
00:57:57,561 --> 00:57:59,258
You know what gonna do.

903
00:57:59,301 --> 00:58:01,478
I'll get technical up here to
blow this up for us.

904
00:58:01,521 --> 00:58:03,480
Yeah.

905
00:58:03,523 --> 00:58:06,004
Tommy, can you handle Edwards
electric?

906
00:58:07,658 --> 00:58:09,137
Ghost:
[voice over]
The cunt that bore the cunt,

907
00:58:09,181 --> 00:58:11,139
that was my mother.

908
00:58:11,183 --> 00:58:13,185
[laughing]
Religious hypocrite, and
eventually my first kill.

909
00:58:13,228 --> 00:58:16,318
After my mother died of
who the fuck cares.

910
00:58:16,362 --> 00:58:18,538
My brother and I went
to live with her.

911
00:58:18,582 --> 00:58:21,106
She caught me being curious
with my penis.

912
00:58:22,629 --> 00:58:24,936
You know, playing.

913
00:58:24,979 --> 00:58:28,722
Enjoying to a catalog, just
like all little boys do.

914
00:58:28,766 --> 00:58:30,768
Curious.

915
00:58:30,811 --> 00:58:34,380
And that's when the cunt
walked in.

916
00:58:34,423 --> 00:58:36,948
I'll cut it off.

917
00:58:36,991 --> 00:58:40,778
She said as she held my
shriveling penis in her claw
like hand.

918
00:58:40,821 --> 00:58:42,780
Sick little things.

919
00:58:42,823 --> 00:58:46,827
The serpent of man.
Spitter of venom.

920
00:58:47,175 --> 00:58:49,656
She said, if I catch you
touching the serpent again,

921
00:58:51,223 --> 00:58:52,920
[dark music]
I'll make you eat
what I cut off!

922
00:58:52,964 --> 00:58:55,314
[angry]
Understood!

923
00:58:55,357 --> 00:58:57,142
You taught me well.

924
00:58:57,185 --> 00:58:59,927
You fucking old cunt.

925
00:58:59,971 --> 00:59:01,973
You will find God. 7 fold.

926
00:59:04,192 --> 00:59:05,454
[heavy breathing]

927
00:59:05,498 --> 00:59:06,978
Newt:
Click, click, click.

928
00:59:07,021 --> 00:59:08,588
Click, click, click.

929
00:59:08,632 --> 00:59:10,590
-Click, click, click.
-Click, click, click.

930
00:59:10,634 --> 00:59:12,592
That's one of
Newt's favorite things.

931
00:59:12,636 --> 00:59:14,638
Click, click, click.

932
00:59:14,681 --> 00:59:16,378
Right Newt?

933
00:59:16,422 --> 00:59:18,119
Click, click, click, click.

934
00:59:18,163 --> 00:59:19,643
Click, click, click

935
00:59:22,210 --> 00:59:26,214
Now, I'm gonna just reach down.
Don't be scared.

936
00:59:27,389 --> 00:59:28,652
[calm]
That's it.

937
00:59:28,695 --> 00:59:30,654
Cause I'm gonna reach under the
water

938
00:59:30,697 --> 00:59:33,874
and find a little place
to play click, click, click.

939
00:59:33,918 --> 00:59:35,354
Amber:
[cying]
No, no, please.

940
00:59:35,397 --> 00:59:37,443
Amber:
[crying]
No, please.

941
00:59:37,486 --> 00:59:40,968
Ghost:
You want to squirm around?
It's okay, it's okay.

942
00:59:57,376 --> 00:59:59,030
-Where else to you want to cut.
-No.

943
00:59:59,073 --> 01:00:00,727
Newt?

944
01:00:00,771 --> 01:00:02,511
What's the name of the game?

945
01:00:02,555 --> 01:00:05,993
-Click, click, click.
-Yes, Newt.

946
01:00:06,037 --> 01:00:09,040
-Click, click, click.
-That's right buddy.

947
01:00:09,083 --> 01:00:12,521
Let's take her in the other
room and play a little fucking
click, click.

948
01:00:12,565 --> 01:00:15,176
Dr. Metcalf:
Are you sure you
don't want any of this?

949
01:00:15,220 --> 01:00:17,657
No, but it smells good.

950
01:00:17,701 --> 01:00:19,528
So, I'll make you plate.

951
01:00:19,572 --> 01:00:21,356
You don't have to eat it.

952
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:23,358
But, you'll like it,
I'm a really good cook.

953
01:00:23,402 --> 01:00:24,577
Really good.

954
01:00:26,927 --> 01:00:29,364
-Thank you.
-You're welcome.

955
01:00:29,408 --> 01:00:32,063
So, how far did you get in this?

956
01:00:32,106 --> 01:00:33,630
Oh, another 60 pages.

957
01:00:36,154 --> 01:00:38,635
But, then more mentions
of Sunshine and...

958
01:00:40,898 --> 01:00:44,858
You know. But, I had a really
great session with Carey
yesterday.

959
01:00:44,902 --> 01:00:47,687
She gave me a couple of um...

960
01:00:47,731 --> 01:00:50,255
fragments of street signs from
the second location.

961
01:00:52,387 --> 01:00:55,173
-Second location?
-Yeah, apparently there are two
places

962
01:00:55,216 --> 01:00:56,783
that he keeps the girls.
One they call the
basement,

963
01:00:56,827 --> 01:00:59,394
and another one,
not too far from there.

964
01:00:59,438 --> 01:01:01,527
I think it's an old buidling.

965
01:01:01,570 --> 01:01:05,574
Anyway, she remembered
two bits of street signs.

966
01:01:06,619 --> 01:01:09,535
I wrote them down for you,
there on a paper over there.

967
01:01:11,755 --> 01:01:14,061
Anything else on the footage?

968
01:01:14,105 --> 01:01:17,412
Ah, actually yeah. We huh, we
pulled a still.

969
01:01:17,456 --> 01:01:20,938
And, in the frame, we found
a, there's a sticker

970
01:01:21,547 --> 01:01:23,244
has some signatures, some dates
and some names on it.

971
01:01:23,288 --> 01:01:25,029
So, we're going to try to
enhance that.

972
01:01:25,072 --> 01:01:27,161
Hopefully, when we get the
image, we're gonna

973
01:01:27,205 --> 01:01:30,730
match that up to a log from
Edwards electric.

974
01:01:30,774 --> 01:01:32,732
-Oh, good.
-We'll see.

975
01:01:32,776 --> 01:01:34,821
Well, that's good.

976
01:01:34,865 --> 01:01:37,868
Television has made me such
a meticulous creature.

977
01:01:39,739 --> 01:01:43,700
The education from forensics
shows, books, online analysis.

978
01:01:43,743 --> 01:01:45,702
Huh-huh.

979
01:01:45,745 --> 01:01:48,835
What not to do to get caught.

980
01:01:48,879 --> 01:01:52,752
My record is clean. I have
barely an existence.

981
01:01:52,796 --> 01:01:54,798
I'm like what you
to call a Ghost.

982
01:01:56,887 --> 01:01:59,933
-Jesus.
-Huh-uh.

983
01:01:59,977 --> 01:02:03,937
What I say to give you a
picture of me will lead you
nowhere

984
01:02:03,981 --> 01:02:07,724
But, don't get me wrong.
I'm not taunting you...

985
01:02:07,767 --> 01:02:09,943
I'm telling you,
telling you I won't stop.

986
01:02:09,987 --> 01:02:13,555
And she made the monster,
you think I am.

987
01:02:13,599 --> 01:02:14,992
She?

988
01:02:15,035 --> 01:02:17,995
Yeah. There's more, it goes on
and on. It's very sad.

989
01:02:18,038 --> 01:02:22,042
[dramatic music]

990
01:02:42,236 --> 01:02:43,760
What's your name?

991
01:02:51,289 --> 01:02:52,507
Amber.

992
01:02:57,251 --> 01:02:58,775
Amber, it's gonna be okay.

993
01:03:02,387 --> 01:03:04,389
[crying]
Ahhhh.

994
01:03:10,438 --> 01:03:12,397
Gina:
Shhhhhh.

995
01:03:12,440 --> 01:03:14,399
Shut up!

996
01:03:14,442 --> 01:03:18,403
Shhhhhh.

997
01:03:18,446 --> 01:03:20,971
Gina:
[whispering loudly]
You cannot scream!

998
01:03:21,014 --> 01:03:24,713
-Stop it.
-You scream, we are all going
to die.

999
01:03:24,757 --> 01:03:26,063
Do you understand that!

1000
01:03:26,106 --> 01:03:27,978
You need to be quiet.

1001
01:03:28,021 --> 01:03:30,023
You're safe as long as you're in
here.

1002
01:03:30,067 --> 01:03:32,025
[intense]
Don't just scream.

1003
01:03:32,069 --> 01:03:34,071
Shhhh, shhh, shhh.

1004
01:03:43,254 --> 01:03:45,256
[whimpering]

1005
01:03:48,607 --> 01:03:50,043
Shhhh.

1006
01:03:50,087 --> 01:03:51,218
Hey-hey-hey.

1007
01:03:51,262 --> 01:03:52,393
[whispering]
Wait.

1008
01:03:52,437 --> 01:03:55,222
Dead quiet, dead quiet.

1009
01:03:55,266 --> 01:03:57,094
[car starting]

1010
01:03:57,137 --> 01:03:58,356
He's leaving.

1011
01:04:01,185 --> 01:04:04,449
[car leaving]

1012
01:04:04,492 --> 01:04:05,972
He's gone.

1013
01:04:07,626 --> 01:04:09,193
He took the car.

1014
01:04:09,236 --> 01:04:10,672
Black Girl:
How do you know?

1015
01:04:10,716 --> 01:04:12,283
He's gone.

1016
01:04:12,326 --> 01:04:14,111
I know, I've been long enough,
I know.

1017
01:04:14,154 --> 01:04:15,852
-Go along with me,
go along with me,
-Gina no.

1018
01:04:15,895 --> 01:04:17,592
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah.

1019
01:04:17,636 --> 01:04:19,377
[shouting]
Hey, Newt.

1020
01:04:19,420 --> 01:04:21,770
Amber:
[crying]
No, no.

1021
01:04:21,814 --> 01:04:23,424
Gina:
[shouting]
You wanna play click, click?

1022
01:04:23,468 --> 01:04:25,296
Newt, we wanna play a game with
you!

1023
01:04:25,339 --> 01:04:27,254
Gina:
[shouting]

1024
01:04:27,298 --> 01:04:30,388
[shouting]
We wanna play click, click.

1025
01:04:30,431 --> 01:04:32,259

[shouting]

1027
01:04:33,347 --> 01:04:35,349
[shouting]
Newt! Newt!

1028
01:04:36,394 --> 01:04:38,352
Gina:
[shouting]
We wanna have fun.

1029
01:04:38,396 --> 01:04:40,354
Newt, it's, it's Gina!

1030
01:04:40,398 --> 01:04:43,401
Do you have, do you have the
keys?

1031
01:04:43,444 --> 01:04:45,098
[shouting]
Newt?

1032
01:04:45,142 --> 01:04:47,361
Come unlock us, so we can play
the game and have fun.

1033
01:04:47,405 --> 01:04:49,798
But you have the
bring the keys, Newt!

1034
01:04:49,842 --> 01:04:51,800
So that we can play
click-click.

1035
01:04:51,844 --> 01:04:53,715
We wanna play click-click!

1036
01:04:53,759 --> 01:04:57,719
Newt! We wanna have fun!

1037
01:04:57,763 --> 01:05:01,506
We wanna have fun Newt!
Let's play!

1038
01:05:01,549 --> 01:05:03,334

1207
01:16:44,208 --> 01:16:45,644
[screaming]
Don't fucking do this!

1208
01:16:45,688 --> 01:16:47,646
Don't!

1209
01:16:47,690 --> 01:16:49,169
No.

Employees only.

1220
01:18:21,784 --> 01:18:23,307
Can't you fucking read.

Oh, hey. Thank's boss!

Fires out.

1228
01:21:03,380 --> 01:21:05,730
Whole place went up fast.

1229
01:21:05,773 --> 01:21:08,776
Should be a couple days before
we can ID any of the bodies.

1230
01:21:11,867 --> 01:21:13,346
Have you told her yet?

1231
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:17,350
I'm gonna do it in person.

1232
01:21:18,264 --> 01:21:19,483
Yeah.

1233
01:21:24,488 --> 01:21:28,448
Is the Warden calmed down yet?

1234
01:21:28,492 --> 01:21:32,452
I'll handle that.

1235
01:21:32,496 --> 01:21:35,238
Reason, I called you
down here,I...

1236
01:21:35,281 --> 01:21:37,980
need you to work with me on
something.

1237
01:21:38,023 --> 01:21:41,157
Quail wants to see ya.

1238
01:21:41,200 --> 01:21:42,419
[sternly]
Fuck him.

1239
01:21:43,507 --> 01:21:45,465
I'll be with you.

1240
01:21:45,509 --> 01:21:47,511
He says he can ID
the next victim.

1241
01:21:53,343 --> 01:21:55,345
Alright yeah. I'll go.

1242
01:22:00,176 --> 01:22:03,527
-Give me a minute will ya?
-Yeah, Alex.

1243
01:22:08,184 --> 01:22:12,188
Quail:
Hmmm.
Tick-tock-tick-tock-tick-tock.

1244
01:22:12,231 --> 01:22:15,147
-Tick-tock.
-Enough with the clock.

1245
01:22:15,191 --> 01:22:17,149
[angry]
The only reason
you are not in a hole,

1246
01:22:17,193 --> 01:22:19,195
is cause you got something to
tell us. Now what is it?

1247
01:22:19,238 --> 01:22:21,762
Tick-tock-tick-tock-tick-tock
-tick-tock.

1248
01:22:23,199 --> 01:22:25,723
Time what a fascinating concept.

1249
01:22:27,290 --> 01:22:31,294
How fast a minute burns, when
you got your new cell mate from
behind--

1250
01:22:32,034 --> 01:22:33,687
violating him.

1251
01:22:33,731 --> 01:22:35,689
Tommy:
Mr. Quail?

1252
01:22:35,733 --> 01:22:37,691
So young and fresh.
Tick-tock-tick-tock.

1253
01:22:37,735 --> 01:22:39,258
Tick-tock.

1254
01:22:39,302 --> 01:22:41,347
And what a minute must feel
like to you

1255
01:22:41,391 --> 01:22:45,395
as the time to save those
little girls, slips through
your fingers.

1256
01:22:46,048 --> 01:22:48,006
[laughing]
Tick-tock

1257
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:49,877
Tommy:
[growing impatient]
Why are we here Mr. Quail?

1258
01:22:49,921 --> 01:22:51,488
Tick-tock

1259
01:22:51,531 --> 01:22:53,272
Tick-tock.

1260
01:22:53,316 --> 01:22:55,448
[taunting]
Tell me Alex, you found your
Ghost yet? Tick-tock.

1261
01:22:55,492 --> 01:22:58,886
-Tick-tock-tick-tock.
-Don't push me Quail!

1262
01:22:58,930 --> 01:23:03,021
-You got the time Alex?
Tick-Tock.
-Yeah.

1263
01:23:03,065 --> 01:23:06,677
-Tick-tock-tick-tock-tick-tock
-Why'd you call us down here Mr.
Quail?

1264
01:23:06,720 --> 01:23:08,809
[loosing it]
I've got the time, yeah, yeah.

1265
01:23:08,853 --> 01:23:11,029
[angry]
Right here. Perfect time for
you.

1266
01:23:11,073 --> 01:23:12,117
-Wanna eat the time.
Tommy:
-Alex! Alex, be cool.

1267
01:23:12,161 --> 01:23:13,727
[ laughing ]

1268
01:23:13,771 --> 01:23:15,033
[laughing]
I like it rough!

1269
01:23:15,077 --> 01:23:17,818
Sorry, Alex. Time's up!

1270
01:23:17,862 --> 01:23:19,820
You lose?

1271
01:23:19,864 --> 01:23:22,910
[taunting]
Say goodbye to Dr. Metcalf.

1272
01:23:22,954 --> 01:23:26,958
Run Alex. Run. I hope
you get there in time!

1273
01:23:27,567 --> 01:23:29,917
[shouting]
Guards. Get him out of my sight!

1274

1276
01:23:34,618 --> 01:23:35,488
Hello

1277
01:23:35,532 --> 01:23:36,011
Jess! It's Alex!

[door bell]
Ding-dong.

1279
01:23:38,709 --> 01:23:40,145
Alex, he's read my work.

1280
01:23:40,189 --> 01:23:42,147
He quotes directly from an
essay I wrote

1281
01:23:42,191 --> 01:23:44,715
from a publication
over 5 years ago.

1282
01:23:48,240 --> 01:23:51,243
No, she's not Alex.

1283
01:23:52,201 --> 01:23:54,203
I'll see you in a few minutes.

1284
01:23:57,641 --> 01:23:59,295
[whispering]
Hello, Sunshine.

1285
01:24:12,003 --> 01:24:13,657
Life is so good.

1286
01:24:22,535 --> 01:24:23,754
Goodbye Dr.

Alex. Let's play!

1289
