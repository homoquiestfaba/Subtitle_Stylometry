1
00:00:00,500 --> 00:00:01,835
And in that area,

2
00:00:01,918 --> 00:00:03,337
We feel we're extremely
well positioned.

3
00:00:03,420 --> 00:00:04,838
The governments involved

4
00:00:04,922 --> 00:00:07,508
Have already passed some
friendly legislation, so...

5
00:00:07,591 --> 00:00:09,135
Sounds risky.

6
00:00:09,177 --> 00:00:11,012
Well, there's always risk,
Mr. Bayard,

7
00:00:11,095 --> 00:00:14,014
But we've got a seasoned
management team in place,

8
00:00:14,098 --> 00:00:17,184
An asset-liability ratio
in excess of 3.5 to 1,

9
00:00:17,267 --> 00:00:18,560
No long-term debt.

10
00:00:18,602 --> 00:00:20,188
We feel confident
that this

11
00:00:20,272 --> 00:00:22,190
Is a great opportunity
for you.

12
00:00:22,274 --> 00:00:24,610
We'd love to include you
as a major investor.

13
00:00:25,027 --> 00:00:26,569
Simon must have a lot
of confidence in you

14
00:00:26,653 --> 00:00:28,864
To put you
on a deal this big.

15
00:00:29,197 --> 00:00:31,450
When did you
make VP?

16
00:00:31,492 --> 00:00:32,869
Two weeks ago.

17
00:00:32,953 --> 00:00:36,122
But it's because this is
my first major deal

18
00:00:36,164 --> 00:00:38,791
That I know it
in and out

19
00:00:38,832 --> 00:00:41,460
And breathe it,
sleep it, eat it.

20
00:00:41,502 --> 00:00:43,796
Um, if you'd like
to go over

21
00:00:43,838 --> 00:00:46,049
The cost-benefit analysis
one more time-

22
00:00:46,132 --> 00:00:48,385
No, that won't be
necessary, Ms. Walker.

23
00:00:48,468 --> 00:00:50,012
If all this
checks out...

24
00:00:51,764 --> 00:00:52,932
I'm in.

25
00:00:53,015 --> 00:00:55,559
You're in.

26
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:56,936
Really?

27
00:00:57,020 --> 00:00:57,937
Really.

28
00:00:58,021 --> 00:01:01,733
Really? That's-
That's wonderful.

29
00:01:01,817 --> 00:01:04,110
Really. Well...

30
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:06,570
I'll send you the paperwork
first thing,

31
00:01:06,612 --> 00:01:08,739
And if you have
any questions-

32
00:01:08,781 --> 00:01:10,326
Excuse me.

33
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:14,414
Ms. Walker, a Mr. Sims
is on the phone for you.

34
00:01:14,455 --> 00:01:15,539
Sorry.

35
00:01:18,167 --> 00:01:19,251
Yeah, David?

36
00:01:19,335 --> 00:01:20,920
Lisa, sorry
to bother you,

37
00:01:21,003 --> 00:01:24,258
But I got a call from
a doctor in Pittsburgh

38
00:01:24,341 --> 00:01:25,759
Regarding
a death certificate

39
00:01:25,842 --> 00:01:27,593
For someone named
Stanley Krasne.

40
00:01:27,677 --> 00:01:30,930
Apparently, he has you
listed as next of kin.

41
00:01:31,014 --> 00:01:33,016
Do you know anything
about this?

42
00:01:34,686 --> 00:01:37,021
I'm sorry.
I can't talk right now.

43
00:01:37,062 --> 00:01:39,023
Can I call you later?

44
00:01:39,106 --> 00:01:40,024
Of course.

45
00:01:40,107 --> 00:01:40,983
Ok.

46
00:01:43,653 --> 00:01:45,029
Everything
all right?

47
00:01:46,782 --> 00:01:48,200
Yes. I'm sorry.

48
00:01:48,283 --> 00:01:49,952
I, uh, I better hurry

49
00:01:50,035 --> 00:01:52,954
To catch that last flight
out of Heathrow.

50
00:01:53,163 --> 00:01:55,873
It's a pleasure doing business
with you, Mr. Bayard.

51
00:01:55,957 --> 00:01:57,625
Yes, it was.

52
00:04:26,786 --> 00:04:28,498
Hey, Melville.

53
00:04:51,772 --> 00:04:53,191
No, that's collateralized

54
00:04:53,233 --> 00:04:55,234
Against the mortgages
on phase one.

55
00:04:55,276 --> 00:04:57,570
We don't consider that
a significant factor.

56
00:04:57,612 --> 00:04:59,239
12-12 million shares?

57
00:04:59,281 --> 00:05:01,283
I need that by noon.

58
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:05,371
I'm going to
check with state again

59
00:05:05,454 --> 00:05:08,333
And get back to you
with the new numbers.

60
00:05:08,541 --> 00:05:10,418
Yeah. No problem.

61
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:12,378
Shoot me now.

62
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:15,005
Delivery for you
out at reception.

63
00:05:15,088 --> 00:05:15,714
What is it?

64
00:05:16,173 --> 00:05:18,343
Delivery for you
out at reception.

65
00:05:30,482 --> 00:05:32,568
They'll last longer
if you put

66
00:05:32,651 --> 00:05:35,028
A little 7up
in the water.

67
00:05:35,069 --> 00:05:38,239
I know it sounds
weird, but it works.

68
00:05:38,322 --> 00:05:40,116
Here.

69
00:05:40,199 --> 00:05:41,576
Sign here.

70
00:05:41,659 --> 00:05:43,537
Ok. Anywhere?

71
00:05:43,621 --> 00:05:45,580
Just, uh,
right over there.

72
00:05:50,544 --> 00:05:51,545
Thank you.

73
00:05:51,629 --> 00:05:53,381
Thanks.

74
00:05:53,464 --> 00:05:55,049
Enjoy them.

75
00:05:55,133 --> 00:05:56,801
Oh, I will.

76
00:06:02,766 --> 00:06:04,225
Yeah?

77
00:06:04,266 --> 00:06:05,559
Hello?

78
00:06:05,601 --> 00:06:07,061
Hey, Danny.

79
00:06:07,103 --> 00:06:09,231
Did you send me
something today?

80
00:06:09,273 --> 00:06:10,483
Like?

81
00:06:10,566 --> 00:06:11,818
Well...

82
00:06:11,901 --> 00:06:14,194
someone sent me
some flowers.

83
00:06:14,653 --> 00:06:16,822
It wouldn't have
occurred to me.

84
00:06:16,864 --> 00:06:18,407
Yeah. That's
what I thought.

85
00:06:18,491 --> 00:06:19,742
Danny, he's here.

86
00:06:19,784 --> 00:06:21,454
Two seconds.
I got to go.

87
00:06:21,537 --> 00:06:23,164
Ok. Bye.

88
00:06:32,465 --> 00:06:34,091
Hi. Thanks for calling.

89
00:06:34,133 --> 00:06:36,761
If you want,
you can leave a message,

90
00:06:36,802 --> 00:06:38,763
But if you don't,
I'll understand.

91
00:06:40,473 --> 00:06:42,601
Hi, um, it's me.

92
00:06:42,642 --> 00:06:45,437
You didn't, um,
send me some flowers

93
00:06:45,479 --> 00:06:48,691
You couldn't possibly
afford, did you?

94
00:06:48,774 --> 00:06:50,860
Um, I'm at work.

95
00:06:50,943 --> 00:06:53,945
Just call me later.
Bye.

96
00:07:02,289 --> 00:07:04,290
Now it looks like

97
00:07:04,332 --> 00:07:07,460
It'll be four to six weeks
before we can get

98
00:07:07,502 --> 00:07:09,004
Any functional
infrastructure into place.

99
00:07:09,463 --> 00:07:11,049
If these numbers are right,

100
00:07:11,508 --> 00:07:14,009
We're looking at 12 to 16
before going on-line.

101
00:07:14,093 --> 00:07:15,927
Right. That should
do it for now.

102
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:20,474
Stay a minute?

103
00:07:22,227 --> 00:07:23,686
How are you, Lisa?

104
00:07:23,769 --> 00:07:25,521
I'm fine.

105
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,149
Good. Take the rest
of the day off.

106
00:07:28,608 --> 00:07:30,152
Pardon?

107
00:07:30,193 --> 00:07:31,236
Take tomorrow off, too.

108
00:07:31,278 --> 00:07:33,488
I don't want to see
you this week.

109
00:07:33,696 --> 00:07:34,907
Simon, I'm fine.

110
00:07:35,074 --> 00:07:37,911
Good. You'll enjoy
the time off more.

111
00:07:37,994 --> 00:07:39,245
Don't misunderstand.

112
00:07:39,579 --> 00:07:41,414
This isn't some kind
of altruistic gesture.

113
00:07:41,497 --> 00:07:44,333
You'll have your hands
full with this.

114
00:07:44,416 --> 00:07:45,667
I want you
in top condition.

115
00:07:45,751 --> 00:07:47,003
This isn't necessary.

116
00:07:47,212 --> 00:07:48,463
This isn't a discussion.

117
00:07:48,547 --> 00:07:50,841
If I see you here before
monday, you're fired.

118
00:07:55,262 --> 00:07:56,555
Excuse me.

119
00:07:56,597 --> 00:07:57,598
Oh!

120
00:07:57,639 --> 00:07:58,766
Late lunch?

121
00:07:59,099 --> 00:08:01,270
Oh. More like
an early retirement.

122
00:08:01,353 --> 00:08:02,271
What?

123
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:04,606
Till monday morning.
Forced vacation.

124
00:08:04,814 --> 00:08:06,023
My sympathies.

125
00:08:06,232 --> 00:08:08,401
2:00 on a tuesday
afternoon.

126
00:08:08,442 --> 00:08:10,570
What do people do?

127
00:08:10,612 --> 00:08:13,114
I have to catch my breath,
they're so cute!

128
00:08:13,156 --> 00:08:15,784
I know you will
love my guests today

129
00:08:15,826 --> 00:08:17,286
Because they're five

130
00:08:17,369 --> 00:08:19,288
Of your favorite
daytime leading men.

131
00:08:19,747 --> 00:08:22,291
The terrible news is
she has 40 dog outfits,

132
00:08:22,333 --> 00:08:24,294
But you don't
have a dog!

133
00:08:25,378 --> 00:08:26,963
We're going to
take a break.

134
00:08:27,047 --> 00:08:28,382
When we come back,

135
00:08:28,423 --> 00:08:30,384
We'll talk about
how we do this show.

136
00:09:35,662 --> 00:09:39,876
48 spring street,
apartment 3a.

137
00:09:39,918 --> 00:09:41,252
Yes, I've got it.

138
00:09:41,336 --> 00:09:44,046
We'll be there by 5:00
at the latest.

139
00:09:44,505 --> 00:09:46,089
Thank you.

140
00:09:46,131 --> 00:09:47,841
Rush, rush, rush.

141
00:09:49,635 --> 00:09:51,597
Uh, can I help you?

142
00:09:51,638 --> 00:09:55,266
Um, yeah, I hope so.

143
00:09:55,350 --> 00:09:57,269
Um, I called
earlier today

144
00:09:57,352 --> 00:09:59,479
About a delivery
I received.

145
00:09:59,563 --> 00:10:01,398
No name on the card.

146
00:10:01,482 --> 00:10:02,565
Oh, Walker, right?

147
00:10:02,649 --> 00:10:04,318
Right.

148
00:10:04,402 --> 00:10:06,821
Jimmy, you know anything
about a floral for Walker

149
00:10:06,905 --> 00:10:08,698
That went out
this morning?

150
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:10,574
No. It wasn't me.

151
00:10:12,368 --> 00:10:14,244
Wait a minute.
What am I thinking?

152
00:10:14,286 --> 00:10:16,121
Today's tuesday.

153
00:10:16,205 --> 00:10:18,876
Yep. He still
must be there.

154
00:10:22,504 --> 00:10:28,720
"Suddenly, the boy felt
the zephyr begin to shake.

155
00:10:28,804 --> 00:10:30,472
"The sound of the water

156
00:10:30,514 --> 00:10:32,640
"Rushing past the hull
grew louder.

157
00:10:32,682 --> 00:10:34,975
"The air filled
with spray

158
00:10:35,059 --> 00:10:38,146
"As the boat sliced
through the waves.

159
00:10:38,229 --> 00:10:40,315
"The bow slowly
began to lift,

160
00:10:40,398 --> 00:10:42,984
"Higher and higher!

161
00:10:43,068 --> 00:10:46,572
The zephyr was flying."

162
00:10:46,614 --> 00:10:48,699
Everything
all right?

163
00:10:48,741 --> 00:10:51,411
Oh, I'm feeling
much better.

164
00:10:51,494 --> 00:10:53,245
How are you doing?

165
00:10:53,328 --> 00:10:54,706
Uh, pretty good.

166
00:10:56,333 --> 00:10:57,751
Lisa Walker.

167
00:10:57,835 --> 00:10:59,086
Right.

168
00:10:59,169 --> 00:11:00,712
I'll see you later.

169
00:11:02,338 --> 00:11:04,257
Um...

170
00:11:04,340 --> 00:11:05,800
How are
your flowers?

171
00:11:05,883 --> 00:11:08,763
Oh, um, they're-
They're beautiful.

172
00:11:08,846 --> 00:11:12,266
Um... look, I don't mean
to seem obsessive,

173
00:11:12,349 --> 00:11:14,602
But your boss-
I spoke to him,

174
00:11:14,685 --> 00:11:17,981
And he said that there's
no record of who sent them,

175
00:11:18,064 --> 00:11:21,277
And he said maybe
you'd know something.

176
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,280
I mean, I have
to know, you know.

177
00:11:25,363 --> 00:11:26,948
Um...

178
00:11:27,032 --> 00:11:30,077
I have to, uh,
I have to be someplace.

179
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:32,080
You want
to walk with me?

180
00:11:32,162 --> 00:11:33,622
There's nothing like

181
00:11:33,706 --> 00:11:36,000
Hearing a story
read out loud.

182
00:11:36,084 --> 00:11:37,460
She's-she's great, too.

183
00:11:37,544 --> 00:11:38,920
A real natural
storyteller.

184
00:11:41,381 --> 00:11:45,427
Do you go
to story hour a lot?

185
00:11:45,511 --> 00:11:47,263
Well, I haven't been lately.

186
00:11:47,305 --> 00:11:48,681
She's been sick.

187
00:11:51,642 --> 00:11:54,436
Look, um...

188
00:11:54,477 --> 00:11:57,774
I, uh, I did
take the order,

189
00:11:57,816 --> 00:11:59,776
But to be honest
with you,

190
00:11:59,818 --> 00:12:02,779
I don't feel it would be
right to tell you.

191
00:12:02,820 --> 00:12:05,115
I know they're your
flowers and all,

192
00:12:05,198 --> 00:12:08,286
But it seemed really
important to the person

193
00:12:08,369 --> 00:12:09,746
That they stay
anonymous.

194
00:12:09,829 --> 00:12:12,081
I'm sure if the
situation were reversed,

195
00:12:12,164 --> 00:12:14,000
You'd want
the same thing.

196
00:12:14,041 --> 00:12:15,542
That's not very likely.

197
00:12:15,584 --> 00:12:18,546
Oh. Why?

198
00:12:18,587 --> 00:12:20,966
If I wanted
to cheer someone up

199
00:12:21,049 --> 00:12:22,800
By sending them flowers,

200
00:12:22,884 --> 00:12:24,803
I wouldn't
make them so crazy

201
00:12:24,886 --> 00:12:26,638
By not signing the card

202
00:12:26,722 --> 00:12:28,557
That they couldn't
enjoy the stupid things

203
00:12:28,599 --> 00:12:29,725
In the first place,

204
00:12:30,184 --> 00:12:31,143
You know?

205
00:12:31,185 --> 00:12:33,229
It sort of defeats
the purpose.

206
00:12:39,777 --> 00:12:41,903
You're not
going to tell me?

207
00:12:42,195 --> 00:12:44,990
I'm-I'm sorry.

208
00:12:55,002 --> 00:12:58,382
Someone sent you flowers?
Who sent you flowers?

209
00:12:58,840 --> 00:13:00,384
Listen, I'll be
at Puffy's 6:30ish.

210
00:13:00,467 --> 00:13:02,427
Come drink adult beverages
with me.

211
00:13:02,510 --> 00:13:04,929
Hey, how come
you're not at work?

212
00:13:14,815 --> 00:13:16,776
All right. Let's
break this down.

213
00:13:16,817 --> 00:13:19,612
We're running out of
people who would have...

214
00:13:19,696 --> 00:13:21,239
Thank you.

215
00:13:21,281 --> 00:13:23,116
Did anyone else
know about Stanley?

216
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:25,369
Maybe someone back in
Pittsburgh sent them.

217
00:13:25,452 --> 00:13:29,539
No. Mm-mmm.
Not a soul.

218
00:13:29,622 --> 00:13:32,708
How about
Captain Thoughtful?

219
00:13:32,792 --> 00:13:35,963
Um, it wouldn't
have occurred to him.

220
00:13:36,046 --> 00:13:37,298
He said that.

221
00:13:37,381 --> 00:13:38,466
No, he didn't.

222
00:13:38,549 --> 00:13:39,634
Danny is, uh...

223
00:13:39,717 --> 00:13:40,969
Yeah.

224
00:13:41,052 --> 00:13:42,303
You know, he's-

225
00:13:42,344 --> 00:13:43,679
He's the romantic
equivalent

226
00:13:43,763 --> 00:13:44,889
Of a night-light.

227
00:13:44,972 --> 00:13:47,141
You say that
as if that's bad.

228
00:13:47,225 --> 00:13:49,937
I don't have time in my life
for anything more.

229
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:52,231
I'm a VP, remember?

230
00:13:52,314 --> 00:13:55,108
Ok, so if it
wasn't Danny,

231
00:13:55,150 --> 00:13:57,402
And it sure as hell
wasn't me-

232
00:13:57,486 --> 00:13:58,946
It was nobody!

233
00:13:58,987 --> 00:14:00,657
Somebody likes you.

234
00:14:00,740 --> 00:14:01,949
Stop it.

235
00:14:01,991 --> 00:14:03,659
Come on. Why not?

236
00:14:03,701 --> 00:14:06,037
Your prince has
finally showed up

237
00:14:06,120 --> 00:14:08,039
To sweep you
off your feet.

238
00:14:08,123 --> 00:14:09,750
It's a nice fantasy.

239
00:14:09,833 --> 00:14:11,168
What fantasy?

240
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:13,003
You got the flowers.

241
00:14:13,045 --> 00:14:16,507
Yeah, but I live on a little
planet called reality

242
00:14:16,591 --> 00:14:18,509
Where stuff like that
just doesn't happen,

243
00:14:18,593 --> 00:14:20,010
And even if it did-

244
00:14:20,094 --> 00:14:21,302
Yeah?

245
00:14:21,344 --> 00:14:25,224
I'm not the sort of person
that they happen to.

246
00:14:27,185 --> 00:14:29,646
It was probably
just some...

247
00:14:29,688 --> 00:14:32,941
clerical error
of the floral world.

248
00:14:33,024 --> 00:14:34,484
Yeah.

249
00:14:34,526 --> 00:14:36,153
And even
if it wasn't,

250
00:14:36,194 --> 00:14:37,655
Prince Charming
probably

251
00:14:37,697 --> 00:14:40,492
Would have turned
out to be a dick.

252
00:14:40,534 --> 00:14:42,493
I'm serious, too.

253
00:14:42,535 --> 00:14:44,286
It's safer
this way.

254
00:14:44,369 --> 00:14:47,081
You'd just be
disappointed.

255
00:14:47,122 --> 00:14:49,417
I'll keep
the fantasy, though.

256
00:14:49,458 --> 00:14:51,920
An anonymous gift
from a secret admirer?

257
00:14:51,961 --> 00:14:54,256
I could go for years
on that.

258
00:14:54,297 --> 00:14:56,300
And I guarantee you

259
00:14:56,383 --> 00:14:57,968
That even
my dullest fantasy

260
00:14:58,010 --> 00:14:59,970
Would be 10 times
more romantic

261
00:15:00,012 --> 00:15:01,930
Than the truth
could ever be.

262
00:15:01,972 --> 00:15:04,768
Oh, god, you got
material like this,

263
00:15:04,809 --> 00:15:06,812
Who wants the truth?

264
00:15:43,183 --> 00:15:45,728
This is terrible.

265
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:47,063
Dallas.

266
00:15:47,146 --> 00:15:50,525
237 people just dropped
right out of the sky.

267
00:15:50,567 --> 00:15:51,942
Joey let you in.

268
00:15:52,026 --> 00:15:54,404
After being tortured
long and mercilessly.

269
00:15:54,488 --> 00:15:58,408
What are you eating?

270
00:15:58,491 --> 00:16:00,118
Pork?

271
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:03,121
No. It's chicken.

272
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:06,292
Oh, my god.
Would you look at that?

273
00:16:06,334 --> 00:16:08,753
I've been watching
for, like, three hours.

274
00:16:08,795 --> 00:16:10,963
It's the same images
over and over.

275
00:16:11,046 --> 00:16:12,548
I'm completely addicted.

276
00:16:16,344 --> 00:16:19,056
Oh, where's Mel?

277
00:16:21,350 --> 00:16:22,810
Oh, no.

278
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:24,144
Really?

279
00:16:24,185 --> 00:16:26,146
Yep.

280
00:16:26,188 --> 00:16:27,981
Didn't the feeder work?

281
00:16:28,023 --> 00:16:29,484
It worked fine.

282
00:16:29,526 --> 00:16:32,320
I think he just died
of loneliness.

283
00:16:32,361 --> 00:16:34,989
Oh, I'm sorry.

284
00:16:35,031 --> 00:16:38,827
Hey, why aren't you
at work, anyway?

285
00:16:38,869 --> 00:16:41,245
And who sent flowers?

286
00:16:43,874 --> 00:16:48,420
Can we just
not talk right now?

287
00:16:48,504 --> 00:16:49,672
Ok.

288
00:16:53,341 --> 00:16:55,011
Thank you.

289
00:16:56,513 --> 00:16:58,014
You're welcome.

290
00:17:42,186 --> 00:17:44,731
Stanley?

291
00:17:46,608 --> 00:17:50,570
Sarah from school
is having

292
00:17:50,654 --> 00:17:53,574
A birthday party
on saturday,

293
00:17:53,657 --> 00:17:56,620
And is it ok
if I go?

294
00:17:56,703 --> 00:18:00,749
I'm going to be on the road
all next week.

295
00:18:00,832 --> 00:18:04,168
Uh, why don't you
ask Mrs. Elkins?

296
00:18:04,210 --> 00:18:06,170
Maybe she'll take you.

297
00:18:11,844 --> 00:18:15,097
Stanley...

298
00:18:15,181 --> 00:18:17,433
When's my birthday?

299
00:18:19,352 --> 00:18:21,353
You don't have one.

300
00:19:29,011 --> 00:19:30,803
Hey.
Ah!

301
00:19:30,887 --> 00:19:32,347
Hi.

302
00:19:32,430 --> 00:19:35,684
I, uh, hoped I might
find you here.

303
00:19:35,976 --> 00:19:37,604
Look, um,

304
00:19:37,687 --> 00:19:39,939
The store doesn't open
for another hour.

305
00:19:40,022 --> 00:19:42,941
Do you want to get
something to eat?

306
00:19:43,025 --> 00:19:44,193
It's a public place.

307
00:19:44,276 --> 00:19:46,153
You'll be
perfectly safe.

308
00:19:48,197 --> 00:19:49,575
There you go.

309
00:19:51,034 --> 00:19:53,328
Do you want
anything to eat?

310
00:19:53,370 --> 00:19:55,497
No. No, I don't.

311
00:19:55,539 --> 00:19:57,333
Nothing for the lady.

312
00:19:57,374 --> 00:20:00,335
I'm going to have
a bowl of corn flakes

313
00:20:00,377 --> 00:20:02,338
And a little
glass of milk.

314
00:20:02,380 --> 00:20:03,381
Ok.

315
00:20:03,465 --> 00:20:06,552
I just-I came down
to tell you that-

316
00:20:06,593 --> 00:20:09,095
I-I sent you
the flowers.

317
00:20:12,890 --> 00:20:14,852
You?

318
00:20:14,893 --> 00:20:17,021
Um, you see,
I, uh...

319
00:20:17,063 --> 00:20:20,065
I like to take
these walks

320
00:20:20,107 --> 00:20:21,608
At-at night,
mostly.

321
00:20:23,569 --> 00:20:25,196
I like to look up

322
00:20:25,237 --> 00:20:26,907
At all the darkened
windows

323
00:20:26,949 --> 00:20:29,368
And wonder what
people's lives are like

324
00:20:29,410 --> 00:20:32,370
And what they're
dreaming about.

325
00:20:32,411 --> 00:20:35,039
One night, I was out
pretty late,

326
00:20:35,081 --> 00:20:37,167
And as, uh,
as usual,

327
00:20:37,250 --> 00:20:39,003
All the windows
were dark...

328
00:20:39,087 --> 00:20:41,171
except one.

329
00:20:41,255 --> 00:20:44,759
And I stopped,
and I looked up.

330
00:20:44,842 --> 00:20:48,638
I saw you...

331
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:51,475
standing there,
and, uh,

332
00:20:51,516 --> 00:20:53,143
And you
were crying,

333
00:20:53,185 --> 00:20:55,104
And I thought,

334
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:59,274
What was it that
made you so sad?

335
00:20:59,357 --> 00:21:01,276
So I followed you
to work

336
00:21:01,317 --> 00:21:02,694
The next morning,

337
00:21:03,237 --> 00:21:04,489
Found out
your name-

338
00:21:04,572 --> 00:21:06,491
And you made this...

339
00:21:06,574 --> 00:21:09,493
incredible arrangement
of flowers

340
00:21:09,577 --> 00:21:11,621
For someone
you've never even met?

341
00:21:11,662 --> 00:21:13,998
Yeah. I'm really
sorry if, uh,

342
00:21:14,082 --> 00:21:16,377
If I was strange
yesterday.

343
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:18,379
Somehow, it seemed
really important to...

344
00:21:18,421 --> 00:21:20,047
to keep it a mystery.

345
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:22,132
Yeah.

346
00:21:24,718 --> 00:21:26,970
Look, what
are you doing

347
00:21:27,054 --> 00:21:28,640
The rest of the day?

348
00:21:28,849 --> 00:21:31,350
Pardon?

349
00:21:31,434 --> 00:21:33,478
Why don't we
spend it together?

350
00:21:33,561 --> 00:21:34,354
What?

351
00:21:37,399 --> 00:21:40,276
No. No!

352
00:21:40,360 --> 00:21:41,445
I know, I know.

353
00:21:41,529 --> 00:21:43,281
This is all
very strange.

354
00:21:43,364 --> 00:21:46,576
It's not the kind of
thing I do every day.

355
00:21:46,618 --> 00:21:48,619
Well, that's good.

356
00:21:48,703 --> 00:21:50,620
Besides,
if you don't come,

357
00:21:50,704 --> 00:21:52,247
How else
will you solve

358
00:21:52,331 --> 00:21:53,792
The rest
of the mystery?

359
00:22:12,895 --> 00:22:13,437
Hey.

360
00:22:15,898 --> 00:22:18,110
Here you go.
Congratulations.

361
00:23:13,878 --> 00:23:15,046
These are Foxgloves.

362
00:23:15,129 --> 00:23:17,048
They do well in
northern climates.

363
00:23:17,132 --> 00:23:18,341
They're beautiful.

364
00:23:18,383 --> 00:23:21,678
Here's Agapanthus.
It's a good flower.

365
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:23,848
A little finicky about
moisture, though.

366
00:23:23,889 --> 00:23:26,683
Oh, nothing worse
than a finicky Agapanthus.

367
00:23:26,725 --> 00:23:31,020
No. They're all going
to be gone soon.

368
00:23:31,062 --> 00:23:32,523
Cold weather
and everything.

369
00:23:32,565 --> 00:23:34,692
Oh, yeah.

370
00:23:34,734 --> 00:23:36,361
That's Heliotrope there.

371
00:23:36,403 --> 00:23:38,363
That's my personal
favorite.

372
00:23:38,405 --> 00:23:40,031
Why?

373
00:23:40,072 --> 00:23:42,033
It reminds me
of the past.

374
00:23:42,075 --> 00:23:45,246
There was a lot of it
where I grew up.

375
00:23:45,329 --> 00:23:46,456
Yeah.

376
00:23:46,539 --> 00:23:48,291
Well, what's yours?

377
00:23:48,374 --> 00:23:49,792
Oh. Favorite?

378
00:23:49,875 --> 00:23:51,292
Yeah.

379
00:23:51,376 --> 00:23:52,794
I don't know.

380
00:23:52,878 --> 00:23:55,798
Roses, I guess.
Pretty boring, huh?

381
00:23:55,881 --> 00:23:58,718
No. Nothing boring
about a classic.

382
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:03,473
So, you
from the city?

383
00:24:03,556 --> 00:24:05,976
I-I grew up
in Pittsburgh.

384
00:24:06,059 --> 00:24:08,312
That where
your family is?

385
00:24:08,395 --> 00:24:09,814
Um...

386
00:24:09,897 --> 00:24:12,483
No. I don't mean
to push or anything.

387
00:24:12,567 --> 00:24:14,152
I just, uh...

388
00:24:14,235 --> 00:24:17,154
a friend of mine
got some once-

389
00:24:17,238 --> 00:24:18,655
Roses, I mean.

390
00:24:18,738 --> 00:24:21,325
They were this pale
lavender gray that-

391
00:24:21,408 --> 00:24:23,161
Sterling roses.
Yeah.

392
00:24:23,245 --> 00:24:24,329
Yeah?

393
00:24:24,413 --> 00:24:26,623
Those are beautiful.
A thornless kind.

394
00:24:26,707 --> 00:24:28,125
Yes, that's right.

395
00:24:28,209 --> 00:24:32,129
Only I think they ought to have
thorns to balance it out

396
00:24:32,212 --> 00:24:33,756
Because otherwise,
they're too perfect.

397
00:24:35,759 --> 00:24:37,010
I don't know.

398
00:24:37,094 --> 00:24:38,803
It kind of seems like

399
00:24:38,886 --> 00:24:41,847
There's enough thorns
out there as it is.

400
00:24:41,930 --> 00:24:44,517
I think every
now and then, um,

401
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:47,313
Everybody's entitled
to too much perfection,

402
00:24:47,396 --> 00:24:48,813
You know?

403
00:24:48,855 --> 00:24:53,068
Have you always been
interested in plants?

404
00:24:57,865 --> 00:24:59,576
I think my, uh,

405
00:24:59,659 --> 00:25:01,077
My grandfather,
actually-

406
00:25:01,161 --> 00:25:02,871
He got me into it.

407
00:25:02,913 --> 00:25:05,374
He was sort of known
around the house

408
00:25:05,416 --> 00:25:07,542
As the king
of amateur gardeners.

409
00:25:07,584 --> 00:25:11,379
He was really,
really bad at it.

410
00:25:11,462 --> 00:25:14,300
I mean, he had
a real black thumb.

411
00:25:14,383 --> 00:25:17,345
You're close
to your family.

412
00:25:17,387 --> 00:25:20,723
Yeah.
Pretty bizarre, huh?

413
00:25:20,764 --> 00:25:23,434
No.

414
00:25:23,518 --> 00:25:26,897
Oh, I forgot
what this feels like.

415
00:25:26,981 --> 00:25:28,398
Hmm?

416
00:25:28,482 --> 00:25:29,900
It feels so decadent.

417
00:25:29,983 --> 00:25:31,901
Decadent?
How do you mean?

418
00:25:31,984 --> 00:25:34,404
I didn't get
anything done today.

419
00:25:34,446 --> 00:25:36,406
You got
a lot done.

420
00:25:36,448 --> 00:25:37,909
No. You know-done.

421
00:25:37,951 --> 00:25:39,910
I failed
to earn my keep.

422
00:25:39,952 --> 00:25:41,412
I did not contribute

423
00:25:41,454 --> 00:25:42,914
To the gross
national product.

424
00:25:42,997 --> 00:25:44,415
Did you
have fun?

425
00:25:44,499 --> 00:25:46,751
Utterly
beside the point.

426
00:25:49,003 --> 00:25:51,298
This is, uh,
this is me.

427
00:25:52,758 --> 00:25:54,385
Oh.

428
00:25:54,468 --> 00:25:55,761
Well...

429
00:25:57,513 --> 00:25:59,681
uh, do you
want to, uh,

430
00:25:59,764 --> 00:26:01,349
Do you want
to come up?

431
00:26:01,391 --> 00:26:03,227
Uh...

432
00:26:05,105 --> 00:26:06,523
I'd better not.

433
00:26:08,232 --> 00:26:10,193
Why?
Because I'm a psycho

434
00:26:10,234 --> 00:26:12,696
Who wanders
the streets at night

435
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:15,033
And follows beautiful
women to work?

436
00:26:16,826 --> 00:26:17,744
Basically.

437
00:26:17,826 --> 00:26:19,245
Ha.

438
00:26:19,328 --> 00:26:21,746
Well, see, actually,
there's something

439
00:26:21,830 --> 00:26:24,374
I just really would
like you to see.

440
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,379
It's not going to be
around much longer,

441
00:26:27,462 --> 00:26:29,380
And it would, um...

442
00:26:29,422 --> 00:26:31,341
I mean,
you don't have to,

443
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:33,552
But it would just
mean a lot to me

444
00:26:33,593 --> 00:26:35,429
If you came up
and saw it.

445
00:26:41,602 --> 00:26:43,396
Here. After you.

446
00:26:50,444 --> 00:26:52,656
Have you lived here long?

447
00:26:52,739 --> 00:26:54,408
Uh...

448
00:26:54,491 --> 00:26:55,868
almost four years.

449
00:26:55,951 --> 00:26:56,869
Really?

450
00:26:56,952 --> 00:26:58,954
Yeah.

451
00:26:59,037 --> 00:27:01,123
Um, would you
like some tea?

452
00:27:01,164 --> 00:27:02,916
No, thanks.

453
00:27:15,722 --> 00:27:18,391
It's a reproduction.

454
00:27:18,475 --> 00:27:21,228
It was painted
as a study.

455
00:27:57,809 --> 00:27:59,353
It's, uh,
it's up here.

456
00:28:11,198 --> 00:28:12,742
Need any help?

457
00:28:16,997 --> 00:28:18,749
It's, uh, this way.

458
00:28:36,518 --> 00:28:38,853
This is incredible!

459
00:28:58,374 --> 00:28:59,959
You're Lewis.

460
00:29:00,168 --> 00:29:01,419
Yeah.

461
00:29:01,503 --> 00:29:03,880
It was my grandfather's
name, too.

462
00:29:03,964 --> 00:29:06,592
Actually, I named
the store after him.

463
00:29:06,634 --> 00:29:10,096
But...
you deliver flowers.

464
00:29:13,141 --> 00:29:16,269
I, uh, like to see
people's faces

465
00:29:16,310 --> 00:29:18,812
When they're
just falling in love

466
00:29:18,896 --> 00:29:21,608
Or making up
from a fight,

467
00:29:21,691 --> 00:29:23,819
Even if they're
grieving.

468
00:29:23,902 --> 00:29:25,529
There's
something beautiful

469
00:29:25,613 --> 00:29:28,615
About a person's
face at that moment.

470
00:29:28,698 --> 00:29:31,744
Yours was
incredible-

471
00:29:31,827 --> 00:29:34,456
Confused
and shocked.

472
00:30:00,192 --> 00:30:02,778
I have...
have to go.

473
00:30:04,696 --> 00:30:07,239
I-I'm sorry.

474
00:30:30,932 --> 00:30:32,350
Who is it?

475
00:30:32,434 --> 00:30:33,810
It's me.

476
00:30:37,273 --> 00:30:39,191
God, it's starting
to get cold.

477
00:30:39,275 --> 00:30:40,693
I'm flying to Phoenix

478
00:30:40,776 --> 00:30:42,570
To move in
with my mother.

479
00:30:42,654 --> 00:30:44,239
She'll be thrilled.

480
00:30:44,322 --> 00:30:45,657
Get it?

481
00:30:52,623 --> 00:30:54,875
Nice flowers.

482
00:30:58,920 --> 00:31:01,424
What the hell
is going on?

483
00:31:06,804 --> 00:31:09,015
Here.

484
00:31:09,098 --> 00:31:11,893
Ok, what is it?
What's going on?

485
00:31:11,935 --> 00:31:14,481
I found out
who it was.

486
00:31:14,522 --> 00:31:15,815
You found out-

487
00:31:15,857 --> 00:31:17,692
I found out,
and he's great.

488
00:31:17,733 --> 00:31:19,901
This is who
sent you the flowers?

489
00:31:19,985 --> 00:31:20,903
Uh-Huh.

490
00:31:20,986 --> 00:31:22,863
Ok. So you found out

491
00:31:22,947 --> 00:31:25,200
Who sent you
these great flowers,

492
00:31:25,242 --> 00:31:27,201
And it turns out

493
00:31:27,285 --> 00:31:28,703
It's this guy
who's great,

494
00:31:28,745 --> 00:31:30,789
And this is really
a terrible thing because...

495
00:31:30,872 --> 00:31:32,291
because...

496
00:31:32,374 --> 00:31:34,543
why is this
a terrible thing?

497
00:31:36,003 --> 00:31:37,379
Ok. It's ok.

498
00:31:37,462 --> 00:31:38,881
Everything's
going to be ok.

499
00:31:38,965 --> 00:31:42,302
I have no idea what's
going on here, but...

500
00:31:42,385 --> 00:31:44,595
I know.
It seems crazy.

501
00:31:44,679 --> 00:31:46,513
No, no, no.

502
00:31:46,596 --> 00:31:48,223
Is this about Danny?

503
00:31:48,265 --> 00:31:50,227
Are you worried
about Danny?

504
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:52,271
No! Oh, no.
Danny's fine.

505
00:31:52,312 --> 00:31:53,772
I mean, we...

506
00:31:53,814 --> 00:31:55,733
It's not like
a spend-the-night

507
00:31:55,816 --> 00:31:57,275
kind of
relationship.

508
00:31:57,317 --> 00:31:58,610
That's the last
thing we wanted.

509
00:31:58,694 --> 00:32:01,196
We just keep each
other around for-

510
00:32:01,280 --> 00:32:03,492
Nocturnal
lighting purposes?

511
00:32:03,575 --> 00:32:05,035
So?

512
00:32:05,119 --> 00:32:06,536
So...

513
00:32:06,619 --> 00:32:08,288
I'm not
in the market.

514
00:32:08,330 --> 00:32:10,665
I don't have any
room in my life

515
00:32:10,706 --> 00:32:12,125
For someone
who's great.

516
00:32:12,208 --> 00:32:14,127
I mean, I work
for a living.

517
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:15,379
Right.

518
00:32:15,463 --> 00:32:17,547
And I'm very good
at my job.

519
00:32:17,631 --> 00:32:19,508
No one disputes this.

520
00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:20,885
I'm just...

521
00:32:22,553 --> 00:32:24,430
I just don't think
I'm up for this.

522
00:32:28,852 --> 00:32:30,187
Oh, my god.

523
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:31,772
What?

524
00:32:31,814 --> 00:32:33,481
It's him.

525
00:32:33,565 --> 00:32:34,816
Who?

526
00:32:34,899 --> 00:32:36,317
You get it.

527
00:32:36,400 --> 00:32:38,653
I... wh...

528
00:32:40,114 --> 00:32:42,283
What... uh...

529
00:32:42,366 --> 00:32:43,910
who is it?

530
00:32:43,993 --> 00:32:45,119
Delivery.

531
00:32:46,787 --> 00:32:47,997
It's him.

532
00:32:48,080 --> 00:32:50,875
It's...
what is it?

533
00:32:50,958 --> 00:32:52,378
Flowers.

534
00:32:52,461 --> 00:32:53,838
That's
what he does.

535
00:32:55,256 --> 00:32:56,840
He's
a delivery boy?

536
00:32:56,924 --> 00:32:59,801
It's sort
of a hobby.

537
00:32:59,884 --> 00:33:01,428
It's... ah...

538
00:33:01,511 --> 00:33:03,430
what do you
want me to say?

539
00:33:03,513 --> 00:33:05,266
Tell him
nobody's home.

540
00:33:05,308 --> 00:33:07,268
He's got flowers.
Forget it.

541
00:33:07,309 --> 00:33:09,854
We've seen what
you do with those.

542
00:33:09,937 --> 00:33:10,980
Kim!

543
00:33:11,064 --> 00:33:12,440
Can I please
just see

544
00:33:12,524 --> 00:33:13,942
What Mr. Right
looks like?

545
00:33:14,025 --> 00:33:15,569
Just...

546
00:33:20,241 --> 00:33:21,576
Delivery?

547
00:33:25,204 --> 00:33:27,622
Is Mr. Right
kind of short,

548
00:33:27,706 --> 00:33:29,917
About 16,
with a little...

549
00:33:40,554 --> 00:33:42,974
all right.

550
00:33:43,057 --> 00:33:44,434
There you go.

551
00:34:15,716 --> 00:34:17,634
"Thank you
for a day

552
00:34:17,718 --> 00:34:19,846
Of too much
perfection."

553
00:35:43,395 --> 00:35:44,897
No. No.

554
00:35:44,980 --> 00:35:47,399
They took a break
between 12:00 and 8:00.

555
00:35:47,483 --> 00:35:48,901
Other than that,
they've been coming

556
00:35:48,985 --> 00:35:50,403
On the hour.

557
00:35:50,486 --> 00:35:52,363
I don't know where
to put them anymore.

558
00:35:52,447 --> 00:35:54,365
That little guy
must be exhausted.

559
00:35:54,448 --> 00:35:55,865
No. There's
another one, too.

560
00:35:55,949 --> 00:35:57,450
They go in shifts.

561
00:35:57,534 --> 00:35:58,953
I know. It's great.

562
00:35:59,037 --> 00:36:00,955
But he's
just wasting it

563
00:36:01,039 --> 00:36:04,084
On the wrong person.

564
00:36:04,167 --> 00:36:07,796
Marry him.
Marry him now.

565
00:36:09,256 --> 00:36:11,217
Oh, my god.

566
00:36:11,301 --> 00:36:13,219
This can't
continue.

567
00:36:13,303 --> 00:36:14,721
No, no, no, no.

568
00:36:14,763 --> 00:36:16,222
That's not
going to be enough.

569
00:36:16,264 --> 00:36:18,849
I'm going to need
at least another 12 dozen.

570
00:36:18,932 --> 00:36:20,893
Fly them in
if you have to.

571
00:36:20,935 --> 00:36:22,353
It's important. Thanks.

572
00:36:22,436 --> 00:36:24,856
You're going to
blow this, buddy.

573
00:36:24,939 --> 00:36:26,566
Have you called
morrow's yet?

574
00:36:26,649 --> 00:36:29,569
You cleaned them out
about six hours ago.

575
00:36:29,653 --> 00:36:31,613
You're going to
scare her off.

576
00:36:31,697 --> 00:36:33,115
I already did that.

577
00:36:33,157 --> 00:36:34,575
Jeez, Lewis, not
for nothing, but-

578
00:36:34,659 --> 00:36:36,119
Randy,
I just found her.

579
00:36:36,202 --> 00:36:38,121
I screwed up once
in my life.

580
00:36:38,204 --> 00:36:39,998
I don't want
to do it again.

581
00:36:40,081 --> 00:36:42,084
Rosen's- We haven't
tried Rosen's yet.

582
00:36:43,709 --> 00:36:45,127
Hey, Pete.
This is Lewis.

583
00:36:45,210 --> 00:36:47,963
I was wondering
if you had any more...

584
00:36:48,297 --> 00:36:50,425
uh, I'll call you back.

585
00:36:52,553 --> 00:36:53,471
Hey.

586
00:36:53,554 --> 00:36:54,472
Hi.

587
00:36:54,555 --> 00:36:56,473
I'll, uh,
I'll clean up.

588
00:36:56,556 --> 00:36:58,225
All right?

589
00:36:58,308 --> 00:36:59,685
Yeah.

590
00:36:59,768 --> 00:37:00,853
Hi.

591
00:37:00,937 --> 00:37:02,272
How are you
doing?

592
00:37:02,356 --> 00:37:04,774
Jimmy, let's go.

593
00:37:07,027 --> 00:37:08,402
Take it easy.

594
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:16,286
I cleaned out the city.

595
00:37:16,370 --> 00:37:17,871
It's all
in my apartment.

596
00:37:22,126 --> 00:37:24,545
Look, um, I'm sorry
about yesterday.

597
00:37:24,628 --> 00:37:27,549
That was all wrong.
I moved too fast.

598
00:37:27,591 --> 00:37:28,967
No, you didn't
move too fast.

599
00:37:29,051 --> 00:37:31,262
I'm just not
used to having, uh...

600
00:37:32,721 --> 00:37:34,513
look,

601
00:37:34,597 --> 00:37:36,557
I know I don't
really know you,

602
00:37:36,641 --> 00:37:39,478
But, uh, yesterday was
one of the nicest days

603
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:41,898
I've had
in a long time.

604
00:37:41,981 --> 00:37:43,399
I just...

605
00:37:43,483 --> 00:37:45,609
I forgot...

606
00:37:45,693 --> 00:37:47,862
it's not...

607
00:37:47,945 --> 00:37:50,198
it's not you.
It's me.

608
00:37:50,281 --> 00:37:51,826
Just...

609
00:37:51,909 --> 00:37:54,494
you're just wasting it
on the wrong girl.

610
00:37:56,622 --> 00:37:59,791
I won't bother you
anymore.

611
00:38:04,463 --> 00:38:06,090
You're not...

612
00:38:06,173 --> 00:38:08,676
you're not
bothering me.

613
00:38:15,308 --> 00:38:17,561
My, uh...

614
00:38:17,645 --> 00:38:18,980
my wife
painted this.

615
00:38:22,358 --> 00:38:25,277
She used to...
to work for museums

616
00:38:25,360 --> 00:38:26,862
Restoring paintings.

617
00:38:28,448 --> 00:38:30,367
I was still
on the trading floor

618
00:38:30,450 --> 00:38:31,827
When she
did that one.

619
00:38:39,418 --> 00:38:41,880
See, we, uh,

620
00:38:41,963 --> 00:38:44,507
We met
in high school,

621
00:38:44,590 --> 00:38:45,925
Started dating,

622
00:38:46,008 --> 00:38:47,426
And after
I got this job

623
00:38:47,509 --> 00:38:49,428
As a runner
at goldman sachs

624
00:38:49,511 --> 00:38:51,430
Working these 14-,
16-hour days,

625
00:38:51,514 --> 00:38:54,726
Paid my dues,
got my own desk-

626
00:38:54,809 --> 00:38:56,728
Six months later,
we, uh,

627
00:38:56,811 --> 00:38:59,231
We got married.

628
00:38:59,273 --> 00:39:03,069
She stayed home,
and she painted,

629
00:39:03,110 --> 00:39:05,446
And I kept
climbing the ladder.

630
00:39:09,409 --> 00:39:11,994
Then she got pregnant.

631
00:39:12,078 --> 00:39:15,247
One night, I was
working pretty late,

632
00:39:15,331 --> 00:39:17,208
And I got this call.

633
00:39:17,291 --> 00:39:21,171
They told me that
she'd gone into labor,

634
00:39:21,255 --> 00:39:23,466
And...

635
00:39:23,549 --> 00:39:25,926
and that there
were complications.

636
00:39:28,846 --> 00:39:32,518
I lost everything
in one second.

637
00:39:36,229 --> 00:39:39,315
So I just-
I cashed out.

638
00:39:42,193 --> 00:39:43,404
Then one day,

639
00:39:43,488 --> 00:39:45,447
I saw this guy
delivering flowers,

640
00:39:45,489 --> 00:39:46,949
And I thought,

641
00:39:46,991 --> 00:39:49,452
"Maybe that's
what I should do.

642
00:39:49,493 --> 00:39:51,913
"I'll deliver
flowers.

643
00:39:51,996 --> 00:39:54,874
"Has to be the best
job in the world.

644
00:39:54,957 --> 00:39:57,878
Everybody's always
happy to see you."

645
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:02,716
I'm sorry.

646
00:40:02,799 --> 00:40:04,634
I'm sorry to lay
all this on you.

647
00:40:27,117 --> 00:40:28,827
One question.

648
00:40:33,166 --> 00:40:34,792
Why me?

649
00:40:36,961 --> 00:40:38,421
I guess...

650
00:40:38,505 --> 00:40:41,466
I guess I finally
looked up...

651
00:40:43,718 --> 00:40:45,179
and...

652
00:40:45,262 --> 00:40:47,098
and your light
was on.

653
00:41:53,669 --> 00:41:54,586
Hey!

654
00:41:54,670 --> 00:41:56,088
Hey.

655
00:41:56,171 --> 00:41:57,673
Morning.

656
00:42:02,721 --> 00:42:05,890
Did you, uh,
you sleep well?

657
00:42:05,973 --> 00:42:08,309
Yeah. My clothes?

658
00:42:08,393 --> 00:42:10,770
I took them
to the dry cleaners.

659
00:42:10,854 --> 00:42:12,482
I hope that's ok.

660
00:42:12,565 --> 00:42:14,233
I had
some things to get-

661
00:42:14,316 --> 00:42:15,734
So I'm a hostage.

662
00:42:15,818 --> 00:42:17,737
I can go get them
real easy.

663
00:42:17,820 --> 00:42:19,155
I'm just kidding.

664
00:42:19,238 --> 00:42:22,117
Uh, I also got you
some toothpaste

665
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:23,617
And your own
toothbrush

666
00:42:23,701 --> 00:42:25,120
And, uh,
your own bathrobe

667
00:42:25,203 --> 00:42:27,122
So you don't
have to walk around

668
00:42:27,206 --> 00:42:28,624
In the sheet,

669
00:42:28,707 --> 00:42:31,042
And there's some
new towels, too.

670
00:42:31,084 --> 00:42:35,213
Exactly what time did you
get up this morning?

671
00:42:35,713 --> 00:42:37,258
Yeah. Bacon-
Do you like bacon?

672
00:42:37,341 --> 00:42:38,801
Because
I wasn't sure,

673
00:42:38,843 --> 00:42:40,804
So I got some ham,

674
00:42:40,845 --> 00:42:42,305
And I got
some steaks.

675
00:42:42,347 --> 00:42:43,806
If you're not
a meat eater,

676
00:42:43,848 --> 00:42:45,308
You know,
I didn't know.

677
00:42:45,349 --> 00:42:47,477
I got some of these
tomatoes here

678
00:42:47,518 --> 00:42:48,978
And some
green peppers

679
00:42:49,020 --> 00:42:50,481
And, um,

680
00:42:50,523 --> 00:42:52,150
Uh, but I
don't know.

681
00:42:52,317 --> 00:42:53,150
Coffee.

682
00:42:53,233 --> 00:42:56,194
Uh, coffee-
Regular or decaf?

683
00:42:56,277 --> 00:42:57,696
Or maybe
you want some tea-

684
00:42:57,779 --> 00:42:59,197
Some
english breakfast,

685
00:42:59,281 --> 00:43:00,699
Earl grey,
orange pekoe?

686
00:43:00,783 --> 00:43:03,369
Coffee, coffee, coffee.
Fine.

687
00:43:03,828 --> 00:43:05,371
Coffee.

688
00:43:05,455 --> 00:43:07,373
Uh, sweet 'n low?
Sugar?

689
00:43:07,457 --> 00:43:09,000
Half-and-half?
Milk?

690
00:43:09,042 --> 00:43:09,960
Black.

691
00:43:10,043 --> 00:43:10,961
Black?

692
00:43:11,044 --> 00:43:12,588
We don't actually
have to eat at all.

693
00:43:12,629 --> 00:43:13,588
The other morning,

694
00:43:13,671 --> 00:43:15,132
You didn't order
breakfast.

695
00:43:15,216 --> 00:43:16,968
I wasn't sure
if that was because

696
00:43:17,051 --> 00:43:18,469
You weren't
a breakfast eater

697
00:43:18,553 --> 00:43:21,096
Or because you thought
I would kill you.

698
00:43:21,138 --> 00:43:23,682
Yeah. I...

699
00:43:23,723 --> 00:43:25,350
was.

700
00:43:25,434 --> 00:43:27,228
Actually,
I'm starving.

701
00:43:27,312 --> 00:43:29,898
Are you? Good. Good.

702
00:43:29,982 --> 00:43:31,734
I must seem pretty
ridiculous here.

703
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:33,234
Mm-Hmm.

704
00:43:33,318 --> 00:43:35,403
I'm not sure,
you know.

705
00:43:35,487 --> 00:43:36,822
Ah...

706
00:43:38,448 --> 00:43:39,868
you're kidding.

707
00:43:39,909 --> 00:43:42,703
It was amazing.
He's amazing.

708
00:43:42,745 --> 00:43:44,205
I mean,

709
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:45,914
We delivered
flowers.

710
00:43:45,998 --> 00:43:49,377
I wore a hat.
It's just...

711
00:43:49,418 --> 00:43:50,837
the whole thing
was...

712
00:43:50,920 --> 00:43:52,339
just completely-

713
00:43:52,381 --> 00:43:53,965
Amazing?

714
00:43:54,049 --> 00:43:55,258
Look who's back.

715
00:43:55,342 --> 00:43:56,426
Hey.

716
00:43:56,885 --> 00:43:59,054
We'll talk later.
You'll tell me everything.

717
00:43:59,096 --> 00:44:00,473
Hello?

718
00:44:00,556 --> 00:44:01,974
Yes. Hi.
I'm sorry.

719
00:44:03,058 --> 00:44:04,477
Hang on a sec.

720
00:44:05,895 --> 00:44:07,147
Hello.

721
00:44:07,189 --> 00:44:10,274
Aha! The creature lives.
Where have you been?

722
00:44:10,358 --> 00:44:11,526
Danny.

723
00:44:11,609 --> 00:44:13,986
You've been working all weekend
again, haven't you?

724
00:44:14,028 --> 00:44:15,446
Can you
hang on a sec?

725
00:44:16,740 --> 00:44:18,158
Um, it's Danny.

726
00:44:18,242 --> 00:44:19,660
Oy.

727
00:44:19,744 --> 00:44:21,162
Can I
call you later?

728
00:44:21,245 --> 00:44:22,163
You better.

729
00:44:22,246 --> 00:44:23,163
Bye.

730
00:44:23,247 --> 00:44:26,083
Hi.

731
00:44:26,167 --> 00:44:29,922
Um, can you
have lunch?

732
00:44:30,005 --> 00:44:31,841
Come on. Guess.

733
00:44:31,924 --> 00:44:33,925
You and your
mysteries, Lewis.

734
00:44:33,967 --> 00:44:35,384
I don't know.

735
00:44:35,426 --> 00:44:37,387
You heard the most
amazing new story?

736
00:44:37,428 --> 00:44:38,888
No.

737
00:44:38,972 --> 00:44:40,891
You bought
a new hoe?

738
00:44:40,974 --> 00:44:42,851
Wen, you're not
even trying.

739
00:44:42,935 --> 00:44:44,311
What?
You built a beach

740
00:44:44,395 --> 00:44:46,230
On top of
the World Trade Center?

741
00:44:46,272 --> 00:44:48,691
No...

742
00:44:48,775 --> 00:44:51,277
I, uh, I met somebody.

743
00:44:51,319 --> 00:44:53,487
Sam, I'm going
to need the car.

744
00:44:55,407 --> 00:44:57,576
Well, it's
a great story-

745
00:44:57,660 --> 00:44:59,036
Standing
in the window,

746
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:00,746
Juliet
on the balcony.

747
00:45:00,829 --> 00:45:04,707
I just don't want to make
any mistakes this time.

748
00:45:04,749 --> 00:45:06,669
I just want to
get everything right.

749
00:45:06,752 --> 00:45:08,546
I want it
to be perfect.

750
00:45:11,091 --> 00:45:12,508
Lewis...

751
00:45:12,591 --> 00:45:14,010
do you, um,

752
00:45:14,093 --> 00:45:15,511
Do you remember
when you were-

753
00:45:15,595 --> 00:45:17,013
You must have been
Jason's age,

754
00:45:17,097 --> 00:45:18,516
Like 7 or 8,

755
00:45:18,599 --> 00:45:20,518
And you were working
with grandpa Lewis

756
00:45:20,602 --> 00:45:22,020
In the garden?

757
00:45:22,103 --> 00:45:24,021
Yeah. He was
teaching me

758
00:45:24,104 --> 00:45:26,022
How to water the plants,
and I thought

759
00:45:26,106 --> 00:45:27,524
If a little water
was good,

760
00:45:27,607 --> 00:45:29,026
Then a bunch...

761
00:45:29,109 --> 00:45:30,861
by the time
we stopped you,

762
00:45:30,946 --> 00:45:33,406
The whole place
looked like Thailand.

763
00:45:33,489 --> 00:45:36,785
Right. Lake Lewis.
I was very proud of that.

764
00:45:36,868 --> 00:45:38,745
It's just that,
you know,

765
00:45:38,787 --> 00:45:41,081
This is your first
time out there.

766
00:45:41,165 --> 00:45:43,959
I just... I would
really be afraid

767
00:45:44,043 --> 00:45:46,921
To see you put
too much on this.

768
00:45:46,963 --> 00:45:48,882
Hmm.

769
00:45:48,965 --> 00:45:50,382
Well, I think

770
00:45:50,466 --> 00:45:53,260
It might be
too late for that.

771
00:45:53,343 --> 00:45:56,097
I think
I'm in love with her.

772
00:45:56,139 --> 00:45:57,808
It's great.

773
00:45:59,810 --> 00:46:01,520
So how did it end up?

774
00:46:01,604 --> 00:46:03,021
He was actually
pretty relieved.

775
00:46:03,104 --> 00:46:05,899
We'd been going for a
long stretch this time.

776
00:46:05,983 --> 00:46:07,860
Listen, how about
I come over later

777
00:46:07,943 --> 00:46:09,488
And maybe
bring us a pizza?

778
00:46:09,571 --> 00:46:12,448
I can't.
I'm leaving early.

779
00:46:12,532 --> 00:46:14,783
Oh. I...

780
00:46:14,867 --> 00:46:17,036
excuse me?

781
00:46:17,077 --> 00:46:18,788
"Snowflakes fell... "

782
00:47:49,470 --> 00:47:51,139
You don't
remember that?

783
00:47:51,222 --> 00:47:53,057
Come on. Hello?

784
00:47:53,516 --> 00:47:54,516
The fruit cocktail.

785
00:47:54,599 --> 00:47:56,018
Thank you.

786
00:47:56,101 --> 00:47:58,020
That year,
we were the only two

787
00:47:58,103 --> 00:48:00,064
Who didn't go home
for winter break.

788
00:48:00,147 --> 00:48:02,066
So we went
up on the roof

789
00:48:02,149 --> 00:48:03,568
And ate
fruit cocktail

790
00:48:03,651 --> 00:48:05,069
And drank
peppermint schnapps

791
00:48:05,153 --> 00:48:06,571
Until I threw up
all over the place.

792
00:48:07,906 --> 00:48:10,367
So how come
you didn't go home?

793
00:48:10,451 --> 00:48:12,661
My mother
was going through

794
00:48:12,703 --> 00:48:15,164
One of her nightmare
dominatrix periods.

795
00:48:15,206 --> 00:48:16,708
You really
don't want to know.

796
00:48:16,791 --> 00:48:18,001
No, you don't.

797
00:48:18,084 --> 00:48:19,877
Why don't you
tell him

798
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,336
About the kids?

799
00:48:21,419 --> 00:48:23,714
I warp young minds.

800
00:48:23,797 --> 00:48:27,678
She works for, um,
an outreach program.

801
00:48:27,719 --> 00:48:29,263
Explain it to him.

802
00:48:29,346 --> 00:48:30,723
Well, you know,

803
00:48:30,806 --> 00:48:33,892
We work on building
their self-esteem,

804
00:48:33,975 --> 00:48:36,270
Working with them
as a team,

805
00:48:36,353 --> 00:48:39,274
And every year
we put on a play.

806
00:48:39,358 --> 00:48:41,275
For example,
we put a little girl

807
00:48:41,359 --> 00:48:42,819
Who maybe
isn't so pretty

808
00:48:42,861 --> 00:48:44,737
<i>As beauty
in beauty and the beast-</i>

809
00:48:44,820 --> 00:48:46,197
That kind of thing.

810
00:48:46,238 --> 00:48:47,698
That's fantastic.

811
00:48:47,740 --> 00:48:50,536
Yeah, when it works.

812
00:48:50,578 --> 00:48:53,038
Right now we got
a real tough case, though-

813
00:48:53,079 --> 00:48:54,915
This 7-year-old girl.

814
00:48:54,998 --> 00:48:57,334
What- what's wrong
with her?

815
00:48:57,376 --> 00:48:59,879
She's... extremely bright.

816
00:48:59,962 --> 00:49:01,880
She builds
these incredible things

817
00:49:01,922 --> 00:49:03,383
All by herself,

818
00:49:03,425 --> 00:49:06,261
But whenever another kid
gets near her, the lights...

819
00:49:06,345 --> 00:49:08,055
go off.

820
00:49:08,097 --> 00:49:10,098
Do you know
what happened to her?

821
00:49:12,183 --> 00:49:13,935
She had it rough.

822
00:49:14,018 --> 00:49:16,730
Her adoptive parents
are really great,

823
00:49:16,814 --> 00:49:18,232
But, uh...

824
00:49:18,316 --> 00:49:20,193
they don't know
what else to do.

825
00:49:20,276 --> 00:49:21,443
Hmm.

826
00:49:21,485 --> 00:49:23,529
You know, I forgot.

827
00:49:23,612 --> 00:49:26,073
Um... I have to
make a phone call.

828
00:49:26,157 --> 00:49:27,158
Excuse me.

829
00:49:34,958 --> 00:49:38,587
So...

830
00:49:39,046 --> 00:49:42,299
so you must be
wondering who I am.

831
00:49:43,884 --> 00:49:45,928
Someone who's...

832
00:49:46,012 --> 00:49:49,349
making Lisa as happy
as I've ever seen her.

833
00:49:50,933 --> 00:49:52,644
But?

834
00:49:52,686 --> 00:49:58,525
But... if you hurt her,
I'll kill you. Ok?

835
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,488
So he went up
into the stands-

836
00:50:03,571 --> 00:50:05,616
In the middle
of the race?

837
00:50:05,783 --> 00:50:07,660
Yeah. He asked her
to dinner,

838
00:50:07,744 --> 00:50:09,621
And that was it.

839
00:50:09,663 --> 00:50:12,248
How about you?
How did your parents meet?

840
00:50:16,294 --> 00:50:20,383
They met at, um...

841
00:50:20,467 --> 00:50:23,177
at a dance,

842
00:50:23,260 --> 00:50:28,891
At a VFW mixer.

843
00:50:28,933 --> 00:50:32,061
My mom had a cold,

844
00:50:32,145 --> 00:50:35,732
And, um, my dad
was there, too,

845
00:50:35,815 --> 00:50:37,859
And he was, uh...

846
00:50:37,901 --> 00:50:40,195
he just kept
asking her to dance,

847
00:50:40,279 --> 00:50:41,696
And she was
too embarrassed

848
00:50:41,780 --> 00:50:43,199
Because of her cold.

849
00:50:43,282 --> 00:50:46,161
She was sneezing
and everything.

850
00:50:46,244 --> 00:50:48,829
So he just offered
to walk her home,

851
00:50:48,913 --> 00:50:50,414
And- and they did.

852
00:50:50,498 --> 00:50:51,999
It turned out

853
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:54,502
They lived in
the same building.

854
00:50:54,544 --> 00:50:55,629
Wow.

855
00:50:55,670 --> 00:50:58,841
Yeah. And, um...

856
00:51:04,096 --> 00:51:07,142
they got married
just six weeks later.

857
00:51:09,520 --> 00:51:12,105
That's a great
story.

858
00:51:12,188 --> 00:51:13,188
Yeah?

859
00:51:13,230 --> 00:51:14,273
Yeah.

860
00:51:18,611 --> 00:51:21,406
I think our story's
the best.

861
00:51:21,448 --> 00:51:22,699
Yeah?

862
00:51:22,783 --> 00:51:23,784
Yeah.

863
00:51:29,123 --> 00:51:30,666
Lisa Walker.

864
00:51:30,749 --> 00:51:32,293
When is your birthday?

865
00:51:32,335 --> 00:51:33,795
What?

866
00:51:33,879 --> 00:51:35,631
In case, on a whim,

867
00:51:35,714 --> 00:51:37,383
I feel like getting you
something.

868
00:51:37,549 --> 00:51:40,343
Well, I was never
real big on birthdays.

869
00:51:40,426 --> 00:51:43,095
Well, I want
to put it down here.

870
00:51:43,179 --> 00:51:45,224
April 1st.

871
00:51:45,432 --> 00:51:48,186
April 1st? Your birthday
is on april fools' day?

872
00:51:48,269 --> 00:51:51,397
Listen, I've got to go.
I'm really busy.

873
00:51:51,438 --> 00:51:52,690
Ok.

874
00:51:52,773 --> 00:51:53,733
Ok. Bye.

875
00:52:33,400 --> 00:52:34,652
Hey.

876
00:52:34,986 --> 00:52:37,280
Hey.

877
00:52:39,241 --> 00:52:40,867
I tried you at work.

878
00:52:40,908 --> 00:52:42,911
What did you have,
a late meeting?

879
00:52:42,994 --> 00:52:45,372
I left early.

880
00:52:45,413 --> 00:52:47,333
Left early?
It's after 10:00.

881
00:53:00,179 --> 00:53:02,640
What is it?

882
00:53:02,682 --> 00:53:05,477
I love you.

883
00:53:12,568 --> 00:53:14,946
I love you, too.

884
00:53:39,098 --> 00:53:41,516
Hi.

885
00:53:43,768 --> 00:53:44,852
It's cute.

886
00:53:44,936 --> 00:53:46,437
I'm a jewish elf.

887
00:53:48,356 --> 00:53:50,442
How you doing?
How's work?

888
00:53:50,525 --> 00:53:53,946
Oh, let's see.

889
00:53:54,029 --> 00:53:55,948
yesterday, I knocked
over a display

890
00:53:56,032 --> 00:53:58,618
Of dishwasher-safe
crockery.

891
00:53:58,701 --> 00:53:59,993
Oh, no.

892
00:54:00,077 --> 00:54:01,788
So today,
I'm in notions.

893
00:54:01,830 --> 00:54:04,583
Can I have
some coffee, please?

894
00:54:06,794 --> 00:54:08,128
So, how you been?

895
00:54:08,211 --> 00:54:10,254
I thought you'd
fallen off the edge.

896
00:54:12,381 --> 00:54:15,428
How is, uh,
how's things at school?

897
00:54:15,511 --> 00:54:17,555
Not great.

898
00:54:17,638 --> 00:54:19,182
I just finished
writing

899
00:54:19,265 --> 00:54:21,100
This year's play.

900
00:54:21,183 --> 00:54:23,227
The performance is
supposed to be the 23rd.

901
00:54:23,311 --> 00:54:24,896
I was hoping
you'd come.

902
00:54:24,979 --> 00:54:27,650
Of course.
I wouldn't miss it.

903
00:54:27,733 --> 00:54:29,735
So how's
married life?

904
00:54:29,776 --> 00:54:31,361
Oh, come on.

905
00:54:31,403 --> 00:54:32,862
You're living
with him.

906
00:54:32,904 --> 00:54:34,572
I still have
my place.

907
00:54:34,656 --> 00:54:37,868
You're living
with him.

908
00:54:37,910 --> 00:54:39,954
So, you two
got big plans

909
00:54:40,037 --> 00:54:41,580
For christmas?

910
00:54:41,664 --> 00:54:44,709
We're supposed to go
to his family's place

911
00:54:44,751 --> 00:54:46,211
For the holidays.

912
00:54:46,294 --> 00:54:47,587
Supposed to?

913
00:54:47,629 --> 00:54:51,216
Yeah. You know, the whole
meet the family routine.

914
00:54:51,300 --> 00:54:53,219
You know, I play
the girlfriend.

915
00:54:53,302 --> 00:54:55,346
I don't know
what the big deal is.

916
00:54:55,429 --> 00:54:57,764
All the functions
family used to serve

917
00:54:57,848 --> 00:55:01,643
Are served by friends
and colleagues now anyway.

918
00:55:01,726 --> 00:55:03,312
I mean, the whole thing

919
00:55:03,396 --> 00:55:04,981
Sounds pretty
prehistoric to me.

920
00:55:05,064 --> 00:55:07,484
You haven't told him
anything about you yet.

921
00:55:10,737 --> 00:55:14,658
I'm just wondering
what happens

922
00:55:14,699 --> 00:55:16,661
When he wants
to marry you,

923
00:55:16,703 --> 00:55:19,413
Which he will.

924
00:55:19,497 --> 00:55:21,415
How are you
going to explain

925
00:55:21,499 --> 00:55:23,667
Your side of the aisle
at the wedding?

926
00:55:23,709 --> 00:55:25,377
It'll be me and me.

927
00:55:25,461 --> 00:55:28,382
I don't see why I have
to explain anything, Kim.

928
00:55:28,423 --> 00:55:31,009
You're right. You don't.
You shouldn't.

929
00:55:31,050 --> 00:55:32,719
You should just stay

930
00:55:32,761 --> 00:55:34,096
In your little
fantasy world

931
00:55:34,179 --> 00:55:35,514
Because it's safe
there.

932
00:55:35,556 --> 00:55:36,849
I'm leaving.

933
00:55:36,890 --> 00:55:38,851
Yeah, right.
Run away. Bye-bye.

934
00:55:38,934 --> 00:55:40,143
Don't forget
your umbrella.

935
00:55:42,105 --> 00:55:44,023
You know,
you're just jealous.

936
00:55:44,482 --> 00:55:45,400
Excuse me?

937
00:55:45,609 --> 00:55:46,984
You'd rather
I stay miserable

938
00:55:47,026 --> 00:55:50,153
And wait with you for a prince
on a white horse.

939
00:55:50,195 --> 00:55:53,283
When it happens to me for real,
you can't take it.

940
00:55:53,366 --> 00:55:54,952
For real?

941
00:55:55,035 --> 00:55:58,080
He doesn't even
know who you are.

942
00:56:01,875 --> 00:56:02,876
Honey...

943
00:56:04,211 --> 00:56:05,839
No, no, no.
Get out of there.

944
00:56:05,922 --> 00:56:07,633
What do you think
I am- Scrooge?

945
00:56:07,674 --> 00:56:10,051
Thanks. You going
to be leaving soon?

946
00:56:10,260 --> 00:56:12,636
Uh, we leave
in the morning.

947
00:56:12,678 --> 00:56:14,138
Is she psyched?

948
00:56:14,180 --> 00:56:15,473
Completely.

949
00:56:15,515 --> 00:56:18,311
Meeting the family.
Big time.

950
00:56:18,352 --> 00:56:20,187
Bigger than
you know, buddy.

951
00:56:20,646 --> 00:56:21,522
Would you mind

952
00:56:21,605 --> 00:56:22,856
Loading the leftover
poinsettias

953
00:56:22,940 --> 00:56:24,817
In the back
of the van?

954
00:56:25,276 --> 00:56:25,860
It's already done.

955
00:56:25,943 --> 00:56:26,861
You're a genius.

956
00:56:26,944 --> 00:56:27,862
Merry christmas,
Lewis.

957
00:56:27,946 --> 00:56:29,571
You, too.
Merry christmas.

958
00:56:48,843 --> 00:56:51,721
Uh, Kim called again.

959
00:56:54,515 --> 00:56:56,102
Yeah. She left
the information.

960
00:56:56,185 --> 00:56:57,603
I don't know.

961
00:56:57,687 --> 00:56:59,104
Maybe she thought

962
00:56:59,187 --> 00:57:02,273
You might
change your mind.

963
00:57:02,315 --> 00:57:05,277
Well...

964
00:57:05,318 --> 00:57:07,112
I'd love to go,
but...

965
00:57:07,154 --> 00:57:08,781
you know...

966
00:57:08,822 --> 00:57:10,741
I'll call her.

967
00:57:10,825 --> 00:57:13,703
Right.

968
00:57:15,538 --> 00:57:18,791
We're, uh,
we're all packed,

969
00:57:18,875 --> 00:57:21,879
So we should probably get
an early start tomorrow.

970
00:57:25,800 --> 00:57:27,718
I can't go
with you tomorrow.

971
00:57:27,801 --> 00:57:31,555
I know- I know it's
really bad timing,

972
00:57:31,596 --> 00:57:34,309
But... I should have
said something before,

973
00:57:34,392 --> 00:57:37,312
But I thought I'd
be able to get out.

974
00:57:37,396 --> 00:57:39,063
We've got this whole
licensing mess

975
00:57:39,105 --> 00:57:40,356
Crashing down on us.

976
00:57:40,440 --> 00:57:42,776
This has nothing
to do with work.

977
00:57:42,817 --> 00:57:46,156
W- what?

978
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:50,409
I, um...

979
00:57:50,493 --> 00:57:53,036
I found
your address book,

980
00:57:53,120 --> 00:57:56,040
And there's
no listing in there

981
00:57:56,082 --> 00:57:58,252
For a Richard
or Ellen Walker.

982
00:57:58,335 --> 00:58:00,587
The only number
for Pittsburgh I found

983
00:58:00,670 --> 00:58:02,464
Was for somebody
named Stanley Krasne.

984
00:58:04,842 --> 00:58:06,802
I also found...

985
00:58:09,095 --> 00:58:12,058
I also found
this picture.

986
00:58:12,142 --> 00:58:14,060
Was that you
and your father?

987
00:58:19,022 --> 00:58:22,611
I don't know
when my birthday is.

988
00:58:22,694 --> 00:58:24,613
When I was
3 months old,

989
00:58:24,696 --> 00:58:28,075
I was found at the
Pittsburgh airport.

990
00:58:31,703 --> 00:58:33,831
It's great, huh?

991
00:58:33,914 --> 00:58:36,084
They put me
in a shelter home,

992
00:58:36,126 --> 00:58:39,671
Then I was placed
with this couple.

993
00:58:39,713 --> 00:58:44,509
The woman died right
after they got me,

994
00:58:44,550 --> 00:58:48,388
But the man petitioned
the state to keep me,

995
00:58:48,472 --> 00:58:53,102
And they said ok,
so, um...

996
00:58:53,185 --> 00:58:54,520
that's, um...

997
00:58:57,357 --> 00:58:59,024
he sold auto parts

998
00:58:59,066 --> 00:59:02,613
And mufflers
and spark plugs.

999
00:59:02,696 --> 00:59:06,116
And, um, he drank,

1000
00:59:06,199 --> 00:59:10,286
And he, um...

1001
00:59:13,582 --> 00:59:16,961
his name
was Stanley.

1002
00:59:17,045 --> 00:59:20,548
He died just
a couple months ago.

1003
00:59:22,425 --> 00:59:25,137
That's it. Big deal.

1004
00:59:25,221 --> 00:59:27,056
It's pretty
disappointing, huh?

1005
00:59:27,098 --> 00:59:29,308
<i>I don't think I
could get on oprah</i>

1006
00:59:29,391 --> 00:59:30,725
With that one.

1007
00:59:31,017 --> 00:59:35,355
Anyway, um...
I'm sorry...

1008
00:59:35,397 --> 00:59:36,941
about all that.

1009
00:59:40,027 --> 00:59:44,324
I'm sorry, but I-

1010
00:59:44,366 --> 00:59:47,077
I can't go
with you tomorrow.

1011
01:00:39,759 --> 01:00:42,512
I want you to go out there.

1012
01:00:42,554 --> 01:00:43,805
You know the play.

1013
01:00:43,930 --> 01:00:46,099
You know
what you have to do.

1014
01:00:46,140 --> 01:00:48,976
I want you
to trust me, ok?

1015
01:00:49,059 --> 01:00:50,895
Go for it.

1016
01:00:55,901 --> 01:00:57,486
We're so sorry,
princess.

1017
01:00:57,570 --> 01:01:00,155
We never meant
to leave you alone.

1018
01:01:03,242 --> 01:01:04,828
Please come back.

1019
01:01:04,912 --> 01:01:06,789
Please come back,
princess Amelia.

1020
01:01:06,997 --> 01:01:09,040
I know it's easier
to stay safe-

1021
01:01:09,082 --> 01:01:12,668
Safe in your dreams,
where no one could hurt you.

1022
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:15,422
But no one could
love you there, either.

1023
01:01:15,672 --> 01:01:18,008
Please come back,
princess Amelia.

1024
01:01:18,091 --> 01:01:20,594
Please wake up
and let us love you.

1025
01:01:48,541 --> 01:01:51,461
Then I wished he didn't
have to kiss me,

1026
01:01:51,544 --> 01:01:53,463
But then
it wasn't that bad.

1027
01:01:53,546 --> 01:01:55,424
Can we do it again?

1028
01:01:55,466 --> 01:01:57,593
We'll see.

1029
01:02:00,553 --> 01:02:01,972
Hi.

1030
01:02:02,055 --> 01:02:04,975
It was- It was great.

1031
01:02:06,686 --> 01:02:09,772
I'm going to, uh,
talk to Lisa.

1032
01:02:17,280 --> 01:02:19,950
Hey.

1033
01:02:19,992 --> 01:02:23,538
Can I still
come with you?

1034
01:02:31,755 --> 01:02:33,715
I changed my mind.

1035
01:02:33,924 --> 01:02:35,425
Would you grab me
an apple?

1036
01:02:35,467 --> 01:02:37,094
Can we turn
the car around?

1037
01:02:37,136 --> 01:02:39,095
They're right
behind your seat.

1038
01:02:39,137 --> 01:02:41,181
I'm going to
be sick.

1039
01:02:42,432 --> 01:02:44,394
Why don't we spend
christmas at home?

1040
01:02:44,436 --> 01:02:46,354
We can watch
"It's a wonderful life"

1041
01:02:46,438 --> 01:02:47,772
For the millionth
time,

1042
01:02:47,813 --> 01:02:49,273
Snuggle
by the fireplace,

1043
01:02:49,315 --> 01:02:50,899
Order curry from
Tandoori Palace,

1044
01:02:50,941 --> 01:02:53,110
And make love
all night. Please?

1045
01:02:53,152 --> 01:02:56,365
Nah. We don't have
a fireplace.

1046
01:03:32,445 --> 01:03:33,822
This is it.

1047
01:03:37,617 --> 01:03:39,161
Maybe we should
go in.

1048
01:03:51,215 --> 01:03:54,510
So this is what
they call nature, huh?

1049
01:03:56,054 --> 01:03:58,598
Yeah, I suppose
that's what they call it.

1050
01:04:03,062 --> 01:04:04,354
If we leave now,

1051
01:04:04,396 --> 01:04:06,690
We could be eating
chutney by 8:00.

1052
01:04:06,731 --> 01:04:08,024
I love you.

1053
01:04:08,066 --> 01:04:10,110
Gee, that changes
everything.

1054
01:04:15,408 --> 01:04:18,035
You all right?

1055
01:04:18,077 --> 01:04:22,373
Do I look like
a total gumbyhead?

1056
01:04:22,415 --> 01:04:24,710
Gumbyhead? No.
You look beautiful.

1057
01:04:24,752 --> 01:04:26,712
It's going to be
all right.

1058
01:04:26,753 --> 01:04:27,880
Mom!

1059
01:04:27,921 --> 01:04:29,214
Hey, come on in.

1060
01:04:29,255 --> 01:04:30,215
How are you?

1061
01:04:30,256 --> 01:04:31,550
Good. How are you?

1062
01:04:31,591 --> 01:04:32,551
This is Lisa.

1063
01:04:32,592 --> 01:04:34,219
Oh, Lisa, welcome!

1064
01:04:34,261 --> 01:04:35,555
Oh, take
your coat off.

1065
01:04:35,597 --> 01:04:37,056
Hi, uncle Lewis!

1066
01:04:37,098 --> 01:04:38,558
Hey, how's
it going?

1067
01:04:38,599 --> 01:04:40,560
Be careful out there.
It's slippery.

1068
01:04:40,602 --> 01:04:43,230
I put Wendy and Sam
in the guest room

1069
01:04:43,271 --> 01:04:44,606
Because of the baby,

1070
01:04:44,690 --> 01:04:47,567
So I put the queen-size
in Lewis' room.

1071
01:04:47,609 --> 01:04:48,819
Mark's old one?

1072
01:04:48,903 --> 01:04:50,822
It's been down
in the basement.

1073
01:04:50,905 --> 01:04:53,616
Jason, stop.
Say hi to uncle Lewis and Lisa.

1074
01:04:53,700 --> 01:04:54,950
Hey, hey.

1075
01:04:55,034 --> 01:04:56,952
This is Bob
and Eva franklin.

1076
01:04:57,035 --> 01:04:57,994
Hi.

1077
01:04:58,078 --> 01:04:59,454
Hey, sis!

1078
01:04:59,538 --> 01:05:02,125
This is my sister Wendy
and her husband Sam.

1079
01:05:02,209 --> 01:05:04,419
Hey, guy. Hi,
nice to meet you.

1080
01:05:04,503 --> 01:05:06,338
This is Lisa.

1081
01:05:06,422 --> 01:05:07,338
Hi.

1082
01:05:07,422 --> 01:05:08,590
This is Katie.

1083
01:05:08,632 --> 01:05:09,800
Hi.

1084
01:05:09,883 --> 01:05:12,804
Jason, stop that,
or I'll break your arm.

1085
01:05:12,887 --> 01:05:14,639
Say hi, Jas.

1086
01:05:14,723 --> 01:05:15,640
Hi, Jas!

1087
01:05:15,724 --> 01:05:18,267
Jason is 8.
Can you excuse me?

1088
01:05:18,351 --> 01:05:20,436
Mark, your brother
and Lisa are here!

1089
01:05:20,477 --> 01:05:21,937
Taylor!

1090
01:05:21,979 --> 01:05:22,938
Where's dad?

1091
01:05:23,022 --> 01:05:26,277
At his meeting.
Then he has a few errands.

1092
01:05:26,359 --> 01:05:28,778
It's aa
15 years in march.

1093
01:05:28,820 --> 01:05:30,656
Grandma jean is, uh...

1094
01:05:30,739 --> 01:05:32,658
I saw her
going upstairs.

1095
01:05:32,741 --> 01:05:34,952
I thinks she's
taking a nap.

1096
01:05:34,994 --> 01:05:36,369
Jason's been
a handful today.

1097
01:05:36,411 --> 01:05:37,789
Aunt meg will be here.

1098
01:05:37,872 --> 01:05:39,958
Please tell me
her camera's still broken.

1099
01:05:40,041 --> 01:05:41,668
She's got a new one.
Auto-wind.

1100
01:05:41,710 --> 01:05:44,379
She's a pathological
picture-taker.

1101
01:05:44,420 --> 01:05:46,005
Pinhead!

1102
01:05:46,047 --> 01:05:47,214
Hey!

1103
01:05:47,298 --> 01:05:48,591
How are you, buddy?

1104
01:05:48,674 --> 01:05:50,052
Good to see you.

1105
01:05:50,093 --> 01:05:52,304
Markie, this is Lisa.

1106
01:05:52,388 --> 01:05:53,889
Hi, Lisa.

1107
01:05:53,973 --> 01:05:55,349
Hi.

1108
01:05:55,391 --> 01:05:57,893
Where's taylor?

1109
01:05:57,935 --> 01:05:59,144
He's finishing up.

1110
01:05:59,228 --> 01:06:02,148
We've been making the reindeer
on Mrs. Jarrod's lawn

1111
01:06:02,231 --> 01:06:04,610
Anatomically correct.

1112
01:06:04,652 --> 01:06:06,112
That's my brother.

1113
01:06:06,152 --> 01:06:07,946
Hey, there he is.

1114
01:06:08,029 --> 01:06:09,655
You forgot
the raspberries!

1115
01:06:09,739 --> 01:06:11,991
No, I did not forget
the raspberries.

1116
01:06:12,075 --> 01:06:13,326
They're in the truck.

1117
01:06:13,410 --> 01:06:15,538
You're off the hook.

1118
01:06:15,580 --> 01:06:17,539
There's my boy!
Good to see you.

1119
01:06:17,581 --> 01:06:18,916
And who's this?

1120
01:06:18,999 --> 01:06:22,837
I know who this is.
Hi, Lisa. Welcome. Welcome.

1121
01:06:22,920 --> 01:06:25,006
They're, uh,
tactile people.

1122
01:06:25,090 --> 01:06:26,423
It's ok.

1123
01:06:26,590 --> 01:06:28,594
You must be tired
after your trip.

1124
01:06:28,677 --> 01:06:30,846
You should catch your
breath before dinner.

1125
01:06:30,930 --> 01:06:32,682
Is that
what I smell?

1126
01:06:32,765 --> 01:06:34,057
Oh, shut up.

1127
01:06:34,141 --> 01:06:35,684
It's chilly up here.

1128
01:06:35,767 --> 01:06:37,685
Tom hasn't fixed
the weather stripping,

1129
01:06:37,769 --> 01:06:40,690
So I put an extra comforter
in your room,

1130
01:06:40,773 --> 01:06:44,027
And there's some extra
blankets in this chest.

1131
01:06:44,069 --> 01:06:45,195
All right.

1132
01:06:45,278 --> 01:06:47,446
There's some
sweaters on the shelf

1133
01:06:47,530 --> 01:06:48,948
And an extra
space heater,

1134
01:06:49,032 --> 01:06:51,034
But it's old and noisy.

1135
01:06:51,076 --> 01:06:53,037
If you need anything,
yell, ok?

1136
01:06:53,079 --> 01:06:54,330
Thank you.

1137
01:06:54,372 --> 01:06:56,999
We're really happy
to have you here.

1138
01:06:57,041 --> 01:06:59,834
Thank you.
I feel very nauseous-

1139
01:06:59,876 --> 01:07:02,838
A- anxious-
I mean, welcome.

1140
01:07:02,880 --> 01:07:06,342
I feel really welcome.
Thank you.

1141
01:07:06,384 --> 01:07:07,760
You are welcome.

1142
01:07:11,973 --> 01:07:15,686
Your mom
must think I'm crazy.

1143
01:07:15,769 --> 01:07:16,853
You ok?

1144
01:07:16,936 --> 01:07:21,651
Your parents-
Everyone is so nice.

1145
01:07:21,734 --> 01:07:25,946
It's all so... nice.

1146
01:07:27,406 --> 01:07:29,366
No. We're plenty
screwed up.

1147
01:07:35,748 --> 01:07:38,001
God... somebody
kept me up

1148
01:07:38,084 --> 01:07:39,670
Half the night
arguing

1149
01:07:39,753 --> 01:07:41,714
And the other half
making up.

1150
01:07:48,595 --> 01:07:51,182
I have three...

1151
01:07:51,265 --> 01:07:52,642
very interesting children...

1152
01:07:54,561 --> 01:07:56,646
who always
keep me surprised.

1153
01:07:56,730 --> 01:08:00,484
I have friends
old and new,

1154
01:08:00,567 --> 01:08:03,320
Family old and new,

1155
01:08:03,404 --> 01:08:06,657
And I just want
to wish all of us

1156
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:08,994
A very, very
merry christmas.

1157
01:08:09,077 --> 01:08:11,288
Merry christmas.

1158
01:08:13,414 --> 01:08:16,166
Dig in. Dig in. 

1159
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:17,626
That was sweet.

1160
01:08:56,460 --> 01:08:58,464
That's a wolf.
Wolf.

1161
01:08:58,547 --> 01:09:00,591
There's another wolf.

1162
01:09:00,633 --> 01:09:02,635
There's
three wolves.

1163
01:09:02,718 --> 01:09:04,094
See the wolf?

1164
01:09:06,054 --> 01:09:08,974
All the little wolvsies.
That's his tail.

1165
01:09:09,058 --> 01:09:10,476
He's got a tail.

1166
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:12,979
Oh, look
at the mountains.

1167
01:09:13,063 --> 01:09:16,566
You climb mountains
so high, it seems...

1168
01:09:16,607 --> 01:09:18,067
hurry up,
you guys!

1169
01:09:18,151 --> 01:09:19,569
What is this?

1170
01:09:19,652 --> 01:09:21,071
Oh, you'll see.

1171
01:09:21,154 --> 01:09:25,035
Hey, you guys!
Sam, honey?

1172
01:09:25,076 --> 01:09:26,869
Hi, mom.

1173
01:09:26,952 --> 01:09:29,871
Ok. Good.
Here we go.

1174
01:09:29,955 --> 01:09:31,874
See, we have
this tradition

1175
01:09:31,915 --> 01:09:34,711
That everybody opens
one gift on christmas eve.

1176
01:09:35,753 --> 01:09:37,380
Sort of
a little preview

1177
01:09:37,463 --> 01:09:39,048
Of tomorrow's
orgy of greed.

1178
01:09:41,676 --> 01:09:43,679
So, who's first?

1179
01:09:43,887 --> 01:09:45,179
Me, me!

1180
01:09:46,348 --> 01:09:48,184
We have something
for Jas.

1181
01:09:48,226 --> 01:09:50,395
Jason, do you want
to open a present?

1182
01:09:50,436 --> 01:09:51,563
Dad, it's right there,

1183
01:09:51,604 --> 01:09:53,898
Under the tree,
right to the left.

1184
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:57,818
This one? Yeah.
There you go.

1185
01:09:59,988 --> 01:10:02,366
Take it easy.
Take it easy.

1186
01:10:02,449 --> 01:10:03,867
<i>That's, uh,
David Copperfield.</i>

1187
01:10:03,951 --> 01:10:06,828
That was my favorite book
when I was your age...

1188
01:10:09,331 --> 01:10:10,833
or around your age.

1189
01:10:10,874 --> 01:10:12,419
Oh, thanks.

1190
01:10:14,671 --> 01:10:16,714
Come on. There's
something else there.

1191
01:10:19,049 --> 01:10:20,468
That's from Lisa
and me.

1192
01:10:23,471 --> 01:10:27,142
<i>Oh, cool!
The legends of Zordak 2.</i>

1193
01:10:28,936 --> 01:10:30,521
Hold it!

1194
01:10:30,604 --> 01:10:33,733
I'm going to break
that camera, I swear.

1195
01:10:33,816 --> 01:10:36,110
I love this!

1196
01:10:36,152 --> 01:10:38,113
I bet it makes
perfect froths.

1197
01:10:38,154 --> 01:10:40,782
It's got color-coded
instructions for you.

1198
01:10:40,824 --> 01:10:42,284
This is beautiful.

1199
01:10:42,325 --> 01:10:44,285
I don't have to
try it.

1200
01:10:44,327 --> 01:10:45,703
Ok. Go ahead.

1201
01:10:45,786 --> 01:10:47,121
I kept
the receipt.

1202
01:10:48,456 --> 01:10:49,708
Uh... Wendy?

1203
01:10:51,293 --> 01:10:52,211
Excuse me.

1204
01:10:52,295 --> 01:10:53,212
Yeah.

1205
01:10:53,296 --> 01:10:54,213
Duty calls.

1206
01:10:54,297 --> 01:10:55,214
Come here,
Katie.

1207
01:10:55,297 --> 01:10:56,715
Come here,
sweetie.

1208
01:10:56,799 --> 01:10:58,968
There you go.
There you go.

1209
01:10:59,010 --> 01:11:00,261
Oh, wait
a minute!

1210
01:11:00,303 --> 01:11:01,597
Does Lisa
have something?

1211
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,642
No, no. It's ok.

1212
01:11:04,683 --> 01:11:06,143
No, no.
Lisa, let's see.

1213
01:11:06,184 --> 01:11:07,393
Honey,
right there?

1214
01:11:07,477 --> 01:11:08,728
No, I'm...

1215
01:11:08,811 --> 01:11:11,648
Mom, mom, no, no, no.
I got this one.

1216
01:11:17,947 --> 01:11:19,824
Here.

1217
01:11:26,665 --> 01:11:28,375
Merry christmas.

1218
01:11:32,754 --> 01:11:34,256
Open it.

1219
01:11:42,349 --> 01:11:43,558
Lewis.

1220
01:11:50,858 --> 01:11:52,277
I'll...

1221
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:54,112
honey, are you ok?

1222
01:11:54,195 --> 01:11:56,072
I just need to...

1223
01:11:58,448 --> 01:11:59,908
air.

1224
01:12:09,294 --> 01:12:10,212
Lisa! What-

1225
01:12:10,295 --> 01:12:12,631
I can't do this.
I don't belong here.

1226
01:12:12,714 --> 01:12:14,507
Let go, please.

1227
01:12:14,591 --> 01:12:15,801
What is it?
What happened?

1228
01:12:15,843 --> 01:12:17,845
What did I do?

1229
01:12:17,887 --> 01:12:20,223
You just
proposed to me

1230
01:12:20,306 --> 01:12:23,184
In front of your
entire family.

1231
01:12:23,225 --> 01:12:25,018
I thought
it would be nice.

1232
01:12:25,102 --> 01:12:27,354
I wanted to
share it with them.

1233
01:12:27,438 --> 01:12:28,481
Nice? Share?

1234
01:12:28,523 --> 01:12:30,692
You always talk about
how you don't want

1235
01:12:30,776 --> 01:12:32,945
To put too much
pressure on me.

1236
01:12:33,279 --> 01:12:34,988
What are you
talking about?

1237
01:12:35,030 --> 01:12:36,782
You push
too hard, Lewis.

1238
01:12:36,823 --> 01:12:38,575
You just
push too hard.

1239
01:12:38,659 --> 01:12:41,413
What did you
expect me to say?

1240
01:12:41,455 --> 01:12:43,916
I expected you
to say yes.

1241
01:12:43,957 --> 01:12:46,709
Then we'd live
happily ever after.

1242
01:12:46,750 --> 01:12:48,419
This isn't
a fairy tale, Lewis.

1243
01:12:48,461 --> 01:12:50,588
Everything has had
to be too perfect

1244
01:12:50,671 --> 01:12:52,090
From the beginning.

1245
01:12:52,131 --> 01:12:53,759
I can't
live up to that.

1246
01:12:53,801 --> 01:12:55,302
You want
to rescue someone,

1247
01:12:55,385 --> 01:12:57,596
And I was
in a window,

1248
01:12:57,679 --> 01:12:59,348
And my light was on.

1249
01:12:59,431 --> 01:13:00,850
Uh... wait a second.

1250
01:13:00,933 --> 01:13:03,269
Maybe that was true
in the beginning, ok?

1251
01:13:03,311 --> 01:13:06,606
But since then, I have
fallen in love with you.

1252
01:13:06,648 --> 01:13:08,108
I want to spend

1253
01:13:08,150 --> 01:13:10,402
The rest of my life
with you.

1254
01:13:10,444 --> 01:13:11,903
You just can't admit

1255
01:13:11,945 --> 01:13:13,947
That somebody could
actually love you.

1256
01:13:14,030 --> 01:13:15,406
That's what it is.

1257
01:13:18,369 --> 01:13:21,289
M- maybe
you're right.

1258
01:13:21,372 --> 01:13:25,960
I mean... you have
an entire house

1259
01:13:26,043 --> 01:13:28,462
Full of people
who love you

1260
01:13:28,546 --> 01:13:30,674
And have always
loved you.

1261
01:13:30,758 --> 01:13:32,385
You don't have
to question that.

1262
01:13:32,426 --> 01:13:34,553
You have a wall
full of pictures,

1263
01:13:34,636 --> 01:13:36,054
Of memories,
of children,

1264
01:13:36,138 --> 01:13:37,555
Things
I've never had.

1265
01:13:37,639 --> 01:13:39,265
You talk about
having a family.

1266
01:13:39,349 --> 01:13:40,767
I have no idea

1267
01:13:40,851 --> 01:13:43,271
What I would do
with a child.

1268
01:13:43,354 --> 01:13:45,272
I have
nothing to give.

1269
01:13:45,356 --> 01:13:49,569
I... can't...
pretend anymore.

1270
01:13:51,279 --> 01:13:54,073
I just can't do this.

1271
01:13:54,115 --> 01:13:57,328
I- I can't do this.

1272
01:14:00,832 --> 01:14:04,083
Look, I'm... I'm sorry.

1273
01:14:04,167 --> 01:14:06,670
I... I didn't...

1274
01:14:08,840 --> 01:14:10,675
I didn't mean
to scare you.

1275
01:14:11,134 --> 01:14:13,136
I mean, that was
never my intention.

1276
01:14:13,220 --> 01:14:14,345
I just...

1277
01:14:15,972 --> 01:14:19,935
Uh... please, I don't
want to lose you.

1278
01:14:19,977 --> 01:14:23,273
Just don't run away.
Please.

1279
01:14:23,315 --> 01:14:26,108
I wish I...

1280
01:14:26,150 --> 01:14:29,111
I wish I could
give you something.

1281
01:14:29,153 --> 01:14:33,116
I wish I could give
you part of myself,

1282
01:14:33,200 --> 01:14:36,119
But that's just
not something I have

1283
01:14:36,202 --> 01:14:38,288
In my possession
right now.

1284
01:14:41,458 --> 01:14:42,835
I'm sorry.

1285
01:16:52,642 --> 01:16:53,726
Bye.

1286
01:16:58,522 --> 01:16:59,940
Bye-bye.

1287
01:17:00,024 --> 01:17:00,900
Bye.

1288
01:17:05,280 --> 01:17:06,323
I...

1289
01:17:06,406 --> 01:17:08,659
what's up with you?

1290
01:17:08,700 --> 01:17:11,245
It's really stupid.

1291
01:17:11,328 --> 01:17:13,163
It's been, um...

1292
01:17:13,204 --> 01:17:14,665
it's been three months,

1293
01:17:14,707 --> 01:17:17,669
And I can't stop
thinking about him.

1294
01:17:17,711 --> 01:17:20,172
It's like, uh,
I take these walks,

1295
01:17:20,213 --> 01:17:23,674
And, uh, I keep showing up
in the same place,

1296
01:17:23,715 --> 01:17:25,676
And I'm outside
his building,

1297
01:17:25,718 --> 01:17:28,347
You know, looking up
at the same window,

1298
01:17:28,388 --> 01:17:32,059
And all
I can think of is,

1299
01:17:32,101 --> 01:17:36,271
I want to be...
there with him...

1300
01:17:36,355 --> 01:17:38,107
like it was,

1301
01:17:38,190 --> 01:17:41,570
And, uh, I can't
even cross the street.

1302
01:17:41,653 --> 01:17:43,988
I just feel like
such an idiot,

1303
01:17:44,072 --> 01:17:46,782
Like the best thing
that ever happened to me,

1304
01:17:46,866 --> 01:17:50,078
And I blew it off,
and I don't know why.

1305
01:17:50,119 --> 01:17:52,831
Why can't you
just go to him?

1306
01:17:52,914 --> 01:17:54,833
Why can't-
Just call him!

1307
01:17:54,917 --> 01:17:56,835
What? What do I say?

1308
01:17:56,919 --> 01:17:58,337
"Hi, it's me.

1309
01:17:58,421 --> 01:17:59,839
"I'm sorry I'm psychotic,

1310
01:17:59,922 --> 01:18:02,091
But, gee, can I have
the ring back?"

1311
01:18:02,175 --> 01:18:04,427
That sounds good.

1312
01:18:04,511 --> 01:18:07,264
How could he
ever forgive me

1313
01:18:07,306 --> 01:18:10,059
After what
I put him through?

1314
01:18:10,100 --> 01:18:12,893
I wouldn't forgive me,
for chri-

1315
01:18:12,935 --> 01:18:14,395
He might not,

1316
01:18:14,437 --> 01:18:17,775
But don't you think that
he's worth the risk?

1317
01:18:19,485 --> 01:18:23,489
I know your life has not
been a fairy tale,

1318
01:18:23,530 --> 01:18:26,492
But if anyone
deserves a happy ending,

1319
01:18:26,534 --> 01:18:28,328
It's you.

1320
01:18:28,369 --> 01:18:30,623
I knew you'd say
the right thing.

1321
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:33,375
You're my best friend.
You're supposed to say that.

1322
01:19:03,281 --> 01:19:05,242
Delivery.

1323
01:19:07,871 --> 01:19:09,289
I didn't even know

1324
01:19:09,372 --> 01:19:11,708
If you were
going to be here

1325
01:19:11,750 --> 01:19:14,085
Or maybe out
on one of your walks.

1326
01:19:14,127 --> 01:19:17,589
I, uh... sort of got
out of the habit.

1327
01:19:17,631 --> 01:19:21,094
Hey, Lewis,
have you seen my bag?

1328
01:19:22,720 --> 01:19:23,971
I'm sorry.

1329
01:19:24,055 --> 01:19:25,347
I'm...

1330
01:19:25,430 --> 01:19:26,723
Lisa!

1331
01:19:26,765 --> 01:19:29,852
Hi.

1332
01:19:29,935 --> 01:19:31,772
Um, I was just...

1333
01:19:31,814 --> 01:19:33,606
Actually,
I have to go, Lewis.

1334
01:19:33,690 --> 01:19:35,775
Sam will be
waiting for us,

1335
01:19:35,817 --> 01:19:38,779
And she's getting fussy,
so we'll hit it.

1336
01:19:38,862 --> 01:19:40,281
Come on in.

1337
01:19:40,364 --> 01:19:42,490
It's really good
to see you again, Lis.

1338
01:19:42,574 --> 01:19:44,619
I'll talk to you
later. Bye-bye.

1339
01:19:59,843 --> 01:20:02,304
Put a little 7up
in the water.

1340
01:20:02,387 --> 01:20:05,098
It sounds weird,
I know, but it works.

1341
01:20:12,899 --> 01:20:17,028
So... um...
how's business?

1342
01:20:19,906 --> 01:20:22,576
Actually, Randy's been
running the shop lately.

1343
01:20:24,411 --> 01:20:25,871
Been working part-time

1344
01:20:25,913 --> 01:20:28,249
As an investment
consultant for the city.

1345
01:20:28,332 --> 01:20:30,585
Public housing, health
care, that kind of thing.

1346
01:20:32,086 --> 01:20:34,589
And, um,
and your family?

1347
01:20:36,925 --> 01:20:38,761
They're good.

1348
01:20:43,848 --> 01:20:48,104
Um... I guess...

1349
01:20:48,187 --> 01:20:50,648
I guess
I should be going.

1350
01:21:00,576 --> 01:21:05,121
Um... this is the part

1351
01:21:05,205 --> 01:21:07,541
Where you're supposed
to say, "wait."

1352
01:21:09,960 --> 01:21:12,922
Yeah, see, I'm supposed
to start to leave,

1353
01:21:13,005 --> 01:21:15,216
And- and that's when...

1354
01:21:17,385 --> 01:21:20,347
you forgive me
for being such a coward...

1355
01:21:22,056 --> 01:21:24,727
and for being the last
one to figure out

1356
01:21:24,769 --> 01:21:26,687
What everyone else
already knew.

1357
01:21:26,729 --> 01:21:28,314
Then...

1358
01:21:29,732 --> 01:21:32,150
You call out,
"Wait. Don't go,"

1359
01:21:32,233 --> 01:21:35,655
And I stop,
and we hold each other,

1360
01:21:35,738 --> 01:21:39,785
And then we know everything's
going to be ok.

1361
01:21:44,748 --> 01:21:46,750
I- I guess...

1362
01:21:46,833 --> 01:21:50,630
I'm not familiar
with the procedure.

1363
01:21:54,174 --> 01:21:58,888
Yeah... I guess not.

1364
01:22:03,852 --> 01:22:09,108
Um... I guess
I'll see you around.

1365
01:22:16,324 --> 01:22:17,701
Wait.

1366
01:22:23,372 --> 01:22:24,957
Don't go.

1367
01:22:43,186 --> 01:22:45,354
How was that?

1368
01:22:52,404 --> 01:22:54,114
That was good.

1369
01:22:56,200 --> 01:22:58,995
Everything's
going to be ok.
