1
00:00:32,106 --> 00:00:34,217
<i>And no wonder, for Satan himself</i>

2
00:00:34,218 --> 00:00:36,698
<i>masquerades as an angel of light.</i>

3
00:02:29,753 --> 00:02:31,495
Get the first-aid kit!

4
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:55,957
David!

5
00:02:58,757 --> 00:02:59,968
Coming, Mom!

6
00:03:04,883 --> 00:03:07,416
Whisper

7
00:03:08,684 --> 00:03:11,343
- Hey, Sid!
- Welcome back to the real world.

8
00:03:11,344 --> 00:03:13,852
Come on, check this out.

9
00:03:13,883 --> 00:03:18,912
Oh... hey, you know what? Hey, Max,
look... I've got to be honest with you...

10
00:03:18,913 --> 00:03:20,787
You wanna buy this place?

11
00:03:20,788 --> 00:03:23,176
- I wouldn't even rob this place.
- Yeah, it's gonna be all mine.

12
00:03:23,177 --> 00:03:24,388
- Ours!
- Ours, ours!

13
00:03:24,389 --> 00:03:28,951
Look just because you worked on the kitchen inside,
doesn't mean that's the only option out here, OK?

14
00:03:28,952 --> 00:03:31,422
No, Sidney, Max is a business man, we've been working on menus...

15
00:03:31,423 --> 00:03:36,956
You know what? I've got a business plan, and it ain't got nothing to do with paper hats and napkins and menus...

16
00:03:36,957 --> 00:03:38,197
I'm done with all this shit, Sid.

17
00:03:38,198 --> 00:03:42,696
Hey, look... I've got this sweet gig, this
December with this guy named Jones.

18
00:03:42,754 --> 00:03:46,664
We grab this little rich kid,
big pay day, everybody wins.

19
00:03:48,425 --> 00:03:50,451
Don't listen to him. OK?

20
00:03:50,564 --> 00:03:53,927
You know what? It's a nice idea.

21
00:03:53,928 --> 00:03:59,998
But think about it, Max. You've got no money.
No collateral, no banks gonna touch you.

22
00:03:59,999 --> 00:04:01,253
I'm gonna do this, Sid.

23
00:04:02,221 --> 00:04:04,167
Well, I'm sure you will.

24
00:04:05,561 --> 00:04:08,416
I'll call you in a couple of weeks, OK?
I mean it.

25
00:04:08,917 --> 00:04:10,352
Get out of here.

26
00:04:13,972 --> 00:04:16,485
It says here you've worked
food service before.

27
00:04:16,486 --> 00:04:20,932
I've short ordered in Quincy,
Walton. A few places in Newport

28
00:04:21,208 --> 00:04:24,940
And with a 50,000 dollars loan, you think you
can resurrect the old Hazel Street Diner, huh?

29
00:04:25,386 --> 00:04:28,900
It's a corner shop, two busy streets,
lots of foot and auto traffic.

30
00:04:28,901 --> 00:04:34,768
Yes, Mr. Truemont, I've reviewed that.
It's not nothing, not really something either.

31
00:04:43,361 --> 00:04:44,975
How'd it go?

32
00:04:45,604 --> 00:04:46,866
Did you get it?

33
00:04:49,489 --> 00:04:50,923
I hope, Sid calls.

34
00:04:52,977 --> 00:04:54,993
I'm gonna take that job, Rox.

35
00:04:56,921 --> 00:04:58,905
I have no place else to go.

36
00:05:02,711 --> 00:05:06,845
OK, sweetheart. I've got to set up
for your party.

37
00:05:06,846 --> 00:05:08,929
So, Chloe will take over from here.

38
00:05:08,930 --> 00:05:10,909
But I like it better when you do it.

39
00:06:06,661 --> 00:06:08,505
Sandborn's party?

40
00:06:09,308 --> 00:06:10,891
Chazzan!

41
00:06:12,521 --> 00:06:14,933
- Wasn't that great, guys?
- Yeah...

42
00:06:16,131 --> 00:06:18,384
It's beautiful, isn't it?

43
00:06:18,385 --> 00:06:22,935
Now, hey! Don't you guys try this at home
with your pets now... Are you ready?

44
00:06:22,970 --> 00:06:24,542
Let see if you can make them disappear.

45
00:06:24,543 --> 00:06:25,861
One...

46
00:06:25,862 --> 00:06:27,694
- Santa!
- Hey... Santa!

47
00:06:27,995 --> 00:06:31,978
Ho! Ho! Ho!
One for everybody!

48
00:06:32,734 --> 00:06:34,384
- One for everybody!
- Ok... Ok.

49
00:06:34,385 --> 00:06:36,324
Ok... be careful! Alright?

50
00:06:36,372 --> 00:06:38,814
- Over here.
- Alright.

51
00:06:39,748 --> 00:06:43,967
No fighting! Ok... Ok, just a minute.

52
00:06:56,314 --> 00:06:58,147
Abrakazzam!

53
00:07:01,130 --> 00:07:03,585
What you want for Christmas, David?

54
00:07:06,317 --> 00:07:08,815
What do you want, Santa?

55
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:13,769
- Ok, birthday cake time.
- Yeah...

56
00:07:19,323 --> 00:07:21,837
Chloe, do you know where David is?

57
00:07:21,838 --> 00:07:23,591
No, I'm not sure.

58
00:07:40,458 --> 00:07:41,824
David!

59
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,112
Oh God!

60
00:07:56,469 --> 00:07:58,730
<i>Kidnapped your son</i>

61
00:07:59,252 --> 00:08:01,289
<i>Don't call the police or we kill him.</i>

62
00:08:16,644 --> 00:08:18,670
I missed you, Sidney.

63
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:21,364
I don't mind your new hair cut.

64
00:08:26,121 --> 00:08:28,658
Are you still glad you came along?

65
00:08:28,694 --> 00:08:33,960
- What're you doing here anyway? Yoko... Uno?
- I'm good with kids, Vince.

66
00:08:34,094 --> 00:08:37,984
- I've got two, what'd you want?
- Huh... two.

67
00:08:38,213 --> 00:08:41,977
Hey! What the hell is that?

68
00:08:41,978 --> 00:08:43,926
- I must’ a missed one.
- No shit.

69
00:08:44,371 --> 00:08:48,423
- Don't matter, here's our boy.
- Alright.

70
00:08:48,665 --> 00:08:50,939
I hope he took the right one.

71
00:09:07,306 --> 00:09:09,952
- Sidney!
- Take it easy.

72
00:09:09,953 --> 00:09:11,814
He's stoppin'.

73
00:09:13,076 --> 00:09:18,535
- Is everything OK, guys?
- Yeah... just ran out of gas.

74
00:09:18,536 --> 00:09:21,670
It's OK... it's OK, we've got 'em covered.

75
00:09:21,671 --> 00:09:26,232
Bobby, where the hell are you?
We've got two flats on 128...

76
00:09:30,905 --> 00:09:34,705
Bobby! For Christ's sake, I'm talking
to you, lazy ass...

77
00:09:34,767 --> 00:09:38,401
Help me, get over there right away...

78
00:09:46,744 --> 00:09:49,636
- What'd he see?
- Probably nothing.

79
00:09:49,637 --> 00:09:53,919
Not here... Max, get the van, let's go.

80
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:55,406
- Fine.
- Come on.

81
00:09:55,407 --> 00:09:59,967
But.. but, he wouldn've seen anything.

82
00:10:09,296 --> 00:10:11,437
Do you want me to wake up?

83
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:13,766
You'll never wake up.

84
00:10:37,267 --> 00:10:41,277
- Mrs. Sandborn! I'm Detective Whitley.
- You think you'll find him?

85
00:10:41,278 --> 00:10:43,902
Ma'am, as I said on the phone,
we're pursuing all leads.

86
00:10:43,903 --> 00:10:46,901
The fact of the matter is, the kidnappers
will probably call, they usually do.

87
00:10:46,902 --> 00:10:49,140
Mrs. Sanborne! Detective Miles.

88
00:10:49,141 --> 00:10:52,448
Look, I know this is a very difficult time,
but I need a list of all your employees...

89
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:54,162
Miles, can I talk to you for a minute?

90
00:10:54,163 --> 00:10:56,026
Excuse me.

91
00:10:57,421 --> 00:11:04,938
I've got this covered, alright? So you just watch, take some notes and see how we do things up here. OK, kiddo?

92
00:11:17,439 --> 00:11:22,077
¶ Love is a burning thing ¶

93
00:11:22,578 --> 00:11:26,377
¶ And it makes a fiery ring ¶

94
00:11:29,478 --> 00:11:33,077
¶ Bound by wild desire ¶

95
00:11:35,078 --> 00:11:39,077
¶ I fell in to a ring of fire ¶

96
00:11:39,578 --> 00:11:43,477
¶ I fell in to a burning ring of fire ¶

97
00:11:43,478 --> 00:11:47,777
¶ I went down, down, down,
and the flames went higher ¶

98
00:11:47,778 --> 00:11:52,977
¶ And it burns, burns, burns,
the ring of fire, the ring of fire ¶

99
00:11:53,778 --> 00:11:56,860
Ughh... I thought this was a summer camp.

100
00:11:58,678 --> 00:12:01,061
And how'd you get your hands on this place?

101
00:12:01,561 --> 00:12:04,214
Huh... he already gave me a couple’ a bucks
to watch it once.

102
00:12:06,912 --> 00:12:08,848
Watch it, what? Collapse?

103
00:12:08,849 --> 00:12:10,160
We all had our better days.

104
00:12:10,161 --> 00:12:13,396
Come on, let's get him inside...
It's not getting any warmer out here.

105
00:12:13,397 --> 00:12:15,593
It's frickin' freezing.

106
00:12:32,467 --> 00:12:36,321
Alright... I just gonna put this on you...

107
00:12:36,622 --> 00:12:39,815
and get you inside where it's warm. OK, buddy?

108
00:12:55,021 --> 00:12:58,292
Alright. It's nothing... it's just the wind, buddy.

109
00:13:06,114 --> 00:13:08,583
Get outta here!

110
00:13:15,649 --> 00:13:18,284
- What?
- It's just a dog.

111
00:13:19,232 --> 00:13:22,525
God blessed the 5th amendments.

112
00:14:03,535 --> 00:14:07,907
There's nothing to be scared of,
it'll be OK. I promise, okay?

113
00:14:08,019 --> 00:14:12,805
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- You got your very own bathroom just inside.

114
00:14:12,806 --> 00:14:15,741
Inside where? Where am I?

115
00:14:15,742 --> 00:14:17,971
Don't worry about that, David.

116
00:14:18,428 --> 00:14:21,199
Just work with us... cooperate.

117
00:14:23,673 --> 00:14:27,641
- Hell, I don't know... think of it as a game.
- Is he trying to hurt me?

118
00:14:28,586 --> 00:14:33,526
No... just relax, buddy.

119
00:14:33,527 --> 00:14:36,359
I'll get you some ice-cream later.
Would you like that?

120
00:14:37,288 --> 00:14:39,254
Alright.

121
00:14:40,152 --> 00:14:43,066
OK... in you go.

122
00:14:49,417 --> 00:14:52,898
You can take off your blindfold now, David.

123
00:14:52,899 --> 00:14:55,409
Oh, you are a regular den-mother!

124
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:57,579
Vince.

125
00:15:14,891 --> 00:15:20,116
Sidney, if you'd let me know, I could
have brought my things and then, shit...

126
00:15:20,117 --> 00:15:22,344
we'd have more channels then
you know what to do with.

127
00:15:28,749 --> 00:15:33,703
Look, huh... I know I don't have to warn you,
but don't go, gettin' too attached to the kid, OK?

128
00:15:33,704 --> 00:15:35,301
I got this.

129
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:38,439
- I'll put us next up.
- OK, thanks.

130
00:15:39,027 --> 00:15:44,128
- Oh, wi wi poo poo, what is this foreign shit?
- We are near the border, Vince.

131
00:15:44,129 --> 00:15:46,671
Border of what? África?

132
00:15:55,132 --> 00:15:57,290
Hey, there we go.

133
00:15:57,691 --> 00:16:02,427
Hah, yeah, all we need now is a pizza, and
we've got ourselves one hell of the evening.

134
00:16:02,428 --> 00:16:04,949
Hey! Den-mother!
You seen his phone book?

135
00:16:04,950 --> 00:16:08,557
Put it down... it's a sure fire way,
we'd leave a paper trail.

136
00:16:08,662 --> 00:16:12,882
Oh, hi mom, yeah, I'm in camp,
I'm gonna have a fun few days.

137
00:16:31,272 --> 00:16:36,611
It's gonna be fine... I won't let anything
happen to him, you know that?

138
00:16:37,567 --> 00:16:40,223
Baby, I wish this was over.

139
00:16:40,808 --> 00:16:43,327
It will be soon.

140
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:50,234
Bed time.

141
00:16:53,023 --> 00:16:56,852
I found you this. I thought you
might get cold.

142
00:16:59,455 --> 00:17:04,324
- Why are you wearing that?
- Well... it's so you won't see who I am.

143
00:17:05,016 --> 00:17:08,149
- Oh...
- You try to get some sleep, OK?

144
00:17:09,547 --> 00:17:14,259
It looks uncomfortable.
I won't peek if you wanna take it off.

145
00:17:25,707 --> 00:17:28,582
OK, but it has to be our secret.

146
00:17:28,583 --> 00:17:31,673
OK... I promise.

147
00:17:40,966 --> 00:17:49,724
¶ Late night at the oasis
send my camel to bed ¶

148
00:18:20,562 --> 00:18:22,472
Do you love me, Max?

149
00:18:23,232 --> 00:18:25,432
Maybe.

150
00:18:34,983 --> 00:18:39,657
When we have the money, you can
remove that if you hate it so much.

151
00:18:39,658 --> 00:18:45,025
I can't remove it,
'cause the scar just comes back.

152
00:18:47,537 --> 00:18:50,720
Baby, you think we're bad people?

153
00:18:51,287 --> 00:18:54,766
There's no commandment in kids kidnapping.

154
00:18:55,040 --> 00:18:57,097
It's stealing though.

155
00:18:57,098 --> 00:19:01,435
It's not stealing... borrowing.

156
00:19:02,680 --> 00:19:06,304
The kid's mother pays Jones,
David's back home tomorrow night.

157
00:19:06,305 --> 00:19:08,271
Who is this Jones anyway?

158
00:19:08,272 --> 00:19:11,109
Doesn't matter, Sidney also don't know Jones.

159
00:19:11,110 --> 00:19:14,968
We get our cut for snatching the kid from home.
They'll do the exchange then we get paid.

160
00:19:15,248 --> 00:19:17,606
Yeah, everybody wins.

161
00:19:19,473 --> 00:19:22,298
Everybody wins.

162
00:19:50,091 --> 00:19:52,409
Max!

163
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:57,380
What is it, baby?

164
00:19:57,623 --> 00:20:00,915
Nothing. I'm sorry
I had a bad dream.

165
00:20:01,019 --> 00:20:03,303
It's OK.

166
00:20:03,782 --> 00:20:06,274
I'm hearing voices.

167
00:20:07,310 --> 00:20:10,230
Would you check on David?

168
00:20:11,344 --> 00:20:14,217
- Yeah.
- Thanks

169
00:20:20,421 --> 00:20:23,100
I don't like it here.

170
00:20:43,623 --> 00:20:45,487
Shit.

171
00:20:46,503 --> 00:20:48,774
I thought you're in bed, I was trying not to scare ya.

172
00:20:48,775 --> 00:20:51,505
Why was my window open, Max?

173
00:20:57,641 --> 00:21:00,153
Don't let the others hear you calling
me that, you understand?

174
00:21:00,154 --> 00:21:04,493
Sorry, sometimes you hear things you don't want to.

175
00:21:06,569 --> 00:21:09,807
Come on, it's alright... go to bed.

176
00:21:29,604 --> 00:21:34,071
Ohh! Goddammit!
This little bastard busted my insulin.

177
00:21:34,072 --> 00:21:37,683
- Hey, hey... calm down.
- He was in the trunk, he must've kicked it or something.

178
00:21:37,684 --> 00:21:40,236
- He didn't do it on purpose.
- Just relax, man, how long if you need more?

179
00:21:40,237 --> 00:21:42,959
Every morning, man, right now!
Alright, give me the keys

180
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:44,488
There must be a pharmacy around here somewhere.

181
00:21:44,489 --> 00:21:47,343
There's one down the road but they're
gonna know you, no way, we can't have that.

182
00:21:47,344 --> 00:21:49,421
Well, I'll go to Portsmouth! Give me the keys!

183
00:21:49,422 --> 00:21:53,061
No, no, that'll cut it too close, I got to be
in Wesley by 5 o'clock to talk to Jones.

184
00:21:53,062 --> 00:21:57,300
- I told you that one car thing was a bad idea.
- The only bad idea is, bringing you along.

185
00:21:57,301 --> 00:22:00,098
Hey!... You take it easy.

186
00:22:00,099 --> 00:22:02,252
Max, take him to Portsmouth.

187
00:22:05,258 --> 00:22:06,881
Alright, go... get him the hell otta here.

188
00:22:06,882 --> 00:22:08,786
Oh, God!

189
00:22:10,927 --> 00:22:13,159
- Come here, you little bastard!
- Just leave him alone!

190
00:22:13,160 --> 00:22:17,499
- Knock it off!
- How you like this?

191
00:22:17,635 --> 00:22:22,916
- Sidney... he's seen our faces.
- Let me just think a minute, alright?

192
00:22:22,917 --> 00:22:25,541
Max, did you lock the door after
you looked in on him last night?

193
00:22:25,542 --> 00:22:29,994
What did she just say?... What did you do?
What did ya... tucked him in or something?

194
00:22:29,995 --> 00:22:32,548
- I swear I locked it.
- Ahhh...

195
00:22:34,242 --> 00:22:39,659
You're better than that, Max, you know
what this means, don't you?

196
00:22:40,117 --> 00:22:42,281
He probably knows our names too.

197
00:22:42,282 --> 00:22:45,052
That freaky kid screwed us again.

198
00:22:45,053 --> 00:22:46,587
He's seen our faces.

199
00:22:46,588 --> 00:22:48,507
- I don't know if we can let him go now.
- What?

200
00:22:48,508 --> 00:22:52,556
- Just stop doing anything till I get back.
- Alright, Max.

201
00:22:52,557 --> 00:22:54,859
- Fine
- Hello! Diabetic!

202
00:23:02,039 --> 00:23:07,531
Just a little bit more, right there,
that's good, stay right there.

203
00:23:38,777 --> 00:23:41,248
Alright... you hungry?

204
00:23:42,501 --> 00:23:43,843
We gotta get back.

205
00:23:43,844 --> 00:23:47,641
Hey, Sidney never believe we got to
Portsmouth and back that quick. Come on.

206
00:23:47,642 --> 00:23:51,227
Let's kill a few hours, man, just to cover us.

207
00:23:53,388 --> 00:23:55,326
Alright.

208
00:23:55,576 --> 00:23:59,236
<i>You have sown the wind and
shall reap a whirlwind</i>

209
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:06,872
Yes?

210
00:24:24,247 --> 00:24:27,791
- You're not helping yourself in here, kid.
- Am I in trouble?

211
00:24:27,792 --> 00:24:30,963
I don't know... that all depends on you.

212
00:24:31,466 --> 00:24:37,903
You think you can huh... forget about what
we look like? Our faces, voices, names? Hmm?

213
00:24:38,985 --> 00:24:40,804
Why?

214
00:24:40,922 --> 00:24:42,572
Why?

215
00:24:42,573 --> 00:24:44,344
Alright, huh...

216
00:24:44,345 --> 00:24:47,281
How about if I give you a little bedtime story?

217
00:24:47,282 --> 00:24:51,500
A couple years back, me and partner
did a job on this registry.

218
00:24:51,501 --> 00:24:56,081
Everything was going real smooth like,
until the teller set off the alarm.

219
00:24:56,084 --> 00:25:05,504
We warned her, don't touch it, don't
go near it, but she did anyway.

220
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:12,118
Now, my partner, well, he was
forced to blow her brains out.

221
00:25:12,119 --> 00:25:18,385
Put a bullet right through her head.
Bang... well, there you have it.

222
00:25:19,367 --> 00:25:22,730
Nobody likes a squealer.

223
00:25:26,564 --> 00:25:28,012
Nice... what is it?

224
00:25:28,013 --> 00:25:33,825
The teller's beaded necklace, it broke
and the beads spilled all over the floor.

225
00:25:34,473 --> 00:25:36,538
How'd you know that?

226
00:25:36,877 --> 00:25:39,886
I know lots of things.

227
00:25:40,482 --> 00:25:44,474
And I know it wasn't your partner
that killed the teller.

228
00:25:44,475 --> 00:25:46,478
That's not what you told the police.

229
00:25:46,479 --> 00:25:52,559
You told that story so many times,
until you actually believe it.

230
00:25:57,081 --> 00:25:59,274
And I know something else.

231
00:25:59,275 --> 00:26:01,978
What's that? What do you know?

232
00:26:01,979 --> 00:26:05,628
I know that you're about to have
a heart attack.

233
00:26:06,913 --> 00:26:09,613
Trying to scare me?

234
00:26:24,456 --> 00:26:27,524
Too bad the car's not here.

235
00:26:32,723 --> 00:26:33,736
Stop.

236
00:26:33,737 --> 00:26:39,416
That was your plan, right?
One car means fewer complications.

237
00:26:41,019 --> 00:26:48,624
I'm afraid you're gonna die here, Sidney., in this lonely old cabin, and shit about the in the room,.

238
00:26:52,160 --> 00:26:53,936
Sidney!

239
00:26:54,131 --> 00:26:55,943
Sidney!

240
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:03,808
<i>911. What's your emergency?</i>

241
00:27:05,875 --> 00:27:08,436
I'm sorry... wrong number.

242
00:27:09,685 --> 00:27:13,572
I'm sorry, Sidney, Max will be here soon.

243
00:27:13,573 --> 00:27:16,205
No... we can't let them know we're here.

244
00:27:16,206 --> 00:27:18,508
Hang on, OK? Max will be here soon.

245
00:27:18,509 --> 00:27:21,118
We'll be OK, then.

246
00:27:33,297 --> 00:27:38,152
Max, baby, it's Sidney, his heart...
I... I'm so sorry, Max.

247
00:27:40,718 --> 00:27:44,451
David was keeping me company,
I was afraid to be alone, Max.

248
00:27:45,222 --> 00:27:49,045
Sorry about Mr. Braverman.
Really, really sorry.

249
00:27:55,225 --> 00:28:01,475
Wow... there's a lot of spiders.
I thought they hibernated in the winter.

250
00:28:01,476 --> 00:28:06,460
- I wonder where the hive is?
- The ground's too frozen to bury him in.

251
00:28:07,602 --> 00:28:11,605
We leave him here a couple’ a days.
Take him with us when we go.

252
00:28:34,645 --> 00:28:37,022
Bigger share now.

253
00:28:37,072 --> 00:28:39,337
Who gives a damn, the kid
just brings us bad luck.

254
00:28:39,422 --> 00:28:40,624
So, what're we gonna do?

255
00:28:40,625 --> 00:28:45,217
We've got two choices, we would drop the
kid by a highway and call it a bust...

256
00:28:45,218 --> 00:28:48,233
Wait, no, no, this is for nothing and we
go back to being broke? No, Goddamn way!

257
00:28:48,234 --> 00:28:53,157
Or... I go to that ring... try to find Jones.

258
00:28:53,533 --> 00:28:55,928
I'm sure if it's still on, we'll get paid.

259
00:28:55,929 --> 00:28:58,694
Yes, and it's a bigger share now.

260
00:28:59,695 --> 00:29:02,971
Vince, I swear to God, you or anyone else...

261
00:29:03,399 --> 00:29:06,250
Sidney's share goes to his niece.

262
00:29:06,589 --> 00:29:10,152
Alright, look, whatever,
So, you're gonna go speak to Jones?

263
00:29:10,153 --> 00:29:14,198
Wait... I thought we were voting.
I vote we let David go.

264
00:29:14,199 --> 00:29:16,071
I've got a bad feeling about this whole thing.

265
00:29:16,072 --> 00:29:18,309
Max?

266
00:29:32,922 --> 00:29:36,151
Take this. For protection.

267
00:29:37,383 --> 00:29:39,886
From what? Elves?

268
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:05,805
<i>Little boy abducted</i>

269
00:30:06,542 --> 00:30:10,289
<i>Scion of Beacon Hill family
grabbed from own 8th birthday</i>

270
00:30:24,332 --> 00:30:26,186
Where is Sidney?

271
00:30:26,187 --> 00:30:29,434
He died, he's... dead.

272
00:30:29,435 --> 00:30:30,752
He had heart attack.

273
00:30:30,753 --> 00:30:33,878
That's unfortunate, is the child still alive?

274
00:30:33,879 --> 00:30:35,580
Of course...

275
00:30:35,581 --> 00:30:39,903
We took a picture, in case his mother
wants prove.

276
00:30:39,904 --> 00:30:43,822
What the?... Well, I have to take another one.

277
00:30:43,823 --> 00:30:47,733
Don't bother! You prepared to call
the mother, right?

278
00:30:49,011 --> 00:30:50,441
Yeah, tonight.

279
00:30:50,442 --> 00:30:51,973
You have what you need?

280
00:30:51,974 --> 00:30:56,862
Yeah... untraceable phone scrambler.
Expert took it all up.

281
00:30:59,369 --> 00:31:00,587
The guy's a pro.

282
00:31:00,588 --> 00:31:03,984
Then, meet me at the Boston Park Ave.
at 10 tomorrow.

283
00:31:03,985 --> 00:31:08,591
You'll get the details for the drop, where
your money is at, and watch your back.

284
00:31:10,234 --> 00:31:12,559
- So, these are all the images, Marla?
- Uh huh.

285
00:31:13,344 --> 00:31:16,844
- Excuse me.
- Oh, Detective... how nice of you to join us.

286
00:31:16,845 --> 00:31:19,363
The kid must still be on Mississippi time.

287
00:31:20,673 --> 00:31:23,549
So, did we narrow down the car Marla?

288
00:31:23,550 --> 00:31:25,526
- Not really, but still looking for a big American car.
- Mh'hm

289
00:31:25,527 --> 00:31:27,175
What about the van?

290
00:31:27,176 --> 00:31:30,763
Wiped clean before they torched it, but I can
be more thorough, when we tow it in.

291
00:31:30,764 --> 00:31:32,286
So, we got nothing.

292
00:31:32,287 --> 00:31:36,056
Not necessarily, look, at least two
of these things have a print.

293
00:31:36,057 --> 00:31:40,773
Including a clean thumb print and a fore finger.
Chances are somebody has a record.

294
00:31:40,774 --> 00:31:43,406
Ahh, that's good, it's real good.

295
00:31:56,637 --> 00:31:59,549
- Let's take a little ride, OK?
- Where're we going?

296
00:31:59,550 --> 00:32:02,063
Just got a few more things to do,
before we can get you home.

297
00:32:02,064 --> 00:32:03,559
But, I'm having fun here.

298
00:32:03,560 --> 00:32:06,004
Not sure, I wanna go home just yet.

299
00:32:06,005 --> 00:32:09,201
What'd you mean, buddy? Of course, you do.

300
00:32:09,202 --> 00:32:11,604
Come on, let's go.

301
00:32:32,822 --> 00:32:35,042
Baby, we should turn back.

302
00:32:35,043 --> 00:32:37,368
Too late for that.

303
00:32:43,063 --> 00:32:44,642
Just keep him down.

304
00:32:44,643 --> 00:32:46,951
Sorry, sweetie.

305
00:32:51,388 --> 00:32:53,931
You can look now, David.

306
00:32:56,074 --> 00:33:00,708
Alright... Scrambler, ready.
Decoder, we're on.

307
00:33:00,709 --> 00:33:02,736
They might not be able to trace us.

308
00:33:03,319 --> 00:33:06,660
- I'm calling your mom, David.
- Oh, good.

309
00:33:11,126 --> 00:33:14,465
We're on, don't forget to do the wire.

310
00:33:16,815 --> 00:33:18,928
OK.

311
00:33:19,292 --> 00:33:20,748
Yes?

312
00:33:20,749 --> 00:33:21,835
Ms. Sandborn?

313
00:33:21,836 --> 00:33:22,795
Speaking.

314
00:33:22,796 --> 00:33:24,734
We have your boy.

315
00:33:26,342 --> 00:33:28,207
I want prove he's alive.

316
00:33:28,208 --> 00:33:30,074
Yeah, alright.

317
00:33:31,493 --> 00:33:33,527
OK.

318
00:33:35,395 --> 00:33:37,768
David?

319
00:33:38,485 --> 00:33:40,496
David, is that you?

320
00:33:42,264 --> 00:33:44,695
Come on, buddy. You're almost there.

321
00:33:46,013 --> 00:33:48,137
Get him to say something.

322
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:50,821
Say something.

323
00:33:53,500 --> 00:33:55,161
Just say hello.

324
00:33:55,162 --> 00:33:57,608
Come on, David, don't be scared.

325
00:33:57,612 --> 00:34:02,788
Yes, be scared... you should be very scared,
of who I am and what I'm gonna do to you...

326
00:34:02,789 --> 00:34:06,442
It's OK... you just say hello, honey.

327
00:34:07,238 --> 00:34:12,097
- Go ahead.
- Goddammit, say something.

328
00:34:12,098 --> 00:34:13,429
- Alright!
- Vince, don't hurt him!

329
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:14,585
Hey, what're you doing?!

330
00:34:14,586 --> 00:34:15,585
Back off!

331
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:17,459
Vince, stop it!
David, it's OK. It's OK.

332
00:34:17,460 --> 00:34:20,030
She did.. she just said my name!

333
00:34:20,031 --> 00:34:21,538
- Oh, boy... damn you...
- What's happening?

334
00:34:21,539 --> 00:34:23,992
- Damn you! She just told them my name!
- Back off!

335
00:34:23,993 --> 00:34:26,145
- What'd you do that for?
- Leave the kid!

336
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,738
- Hang on a minute... hang on.
- Take it off, Max!

337
00:34:31,011 --> 00:34:33,260
What the hell, are you doing?!

338
00:34:33,981 --> 00:34:37,699
We lost them.
OK, next time they call, let's double up.

339
00:34:37,700 --> 00:34:40,156
- Did you get a match?
- No.

340
00:34:40,157 --> 00:34:42,714
- Any signal trace data?
- No

341
00:34:42,715 --> 00:34:45,780
- Ms. Sandborn, sorry you had to hear that...
- Is David alive?

342
00:34:45,781 --> 00:34:50,124
- We didn't get a voice match, didn't know the location.
- Is he dead?

343
00:34:50,125 --> 00:34:54,239
- Did they kill him?
- Catherine, we don't know, we have no idea.

344
00:34:57,659 --> 00:35:00,125
So, what you guys wanna do now?

345
00:35:00,586 --> 00:35:02,612
I could really go for that ice-cream.

346
00:35:02,613 --> 00:35:03,910
- Alright, that's it!
- Vince!

347
00:35:03,911 --> 00:35:05,944
Don't you hurt him!

348
00:35:09,471 --> 00:35:11,622
It's OK. It's OK. Everything's fine.

349
00:35:11,623 --> 00:35:13,741
It's not OK!

350
00:35:14,534 --> 00:35:15,828
What're you doing, Max?

351
00:35:15,829 --> 00:35:18,278
What I should have done a long time ago!

352
00:35:18,279 --> 00:35:21,867
Stop using my damn name. It's a good
way for a kid to wind up dead.

353
00:35:21,868 --> 00:35:24,572
Will I be your first?

354
00:35:39,414 --> 00:35:41,298
Max, look out!

355
00:35:43,198 --> 00:35:45,069
What the hell was that?

356
00:35:45,806 --> 00:35:47,899
Did you see that?

357
00:35:58,062 --> 00:36:00,586
Max?

358
00:36:44,230 --> 00:36:46,257
Can't sleep, huh?

359
00:36:47,170 --> 00:36:49,082
Nightmares.

360
00:36:49,448 --> 00:36:51,588
You want some company?

361
00:36:51,915 --> 00:36:54,803
No thanks, Vince, I just wanna be alone.

362
00:37:20,401 --> 00:37:23,350
Please forgive me.

363
00:37:27,408 --> 00:37:29,288
Vince?

364
00:37:45,070 --> 00:37:47,017
Vince?

365
00:38:23,043 --> 00:38:25,791
Vince, is that you down there?

366
00:39:13,421 --> 00:39:15,430
Your move.

367
00:39:15,550 --> 00:39:18,952
- Hey, who let you out?
- Nobody.

368
00:39:18,953 --> 00:39:23,154
- Where's Max?
- He went to go talk with someone called Jones.

369
00:39:23,404 --> 00:39:26,229
Hmm, I'm glad someone is up on these things.

370
00:39:27,164 --> 00:39:29,275
Where's Roxanne?

371
00:39:29,313 --> 00:39:31,354
Why?

372
00:39:31,645 --> 00:39:38,093
Hey, listen. After that stunt you pull last night,
you should be laying down in the cell next to Sid.

373
00:39:39,053 --> 00:39:42,500
You couldn't kill me, you don't have it in you.

374
00:39:43,953 --> 00:39:45,500
Well...

375
00:39:50,169 --> 00:39:52,142
Wanna play?

376
00:40:10,610 --> 00:40:12,696
- Aahh...
- Good morning!

377
00:40:15,483 --> 00:40:21,736
How come she's not your girlfriend? The way
she acts around you, seems like she likes you.

378
00:40:21,737 --> 00:40:24,093
What the hell would you know?

379
00:40:25,914 --> 00:40:31,269
Last night... I could hear her through the walls.
She was praying.

380
00:40:32,653 --> 00:40:35,230
She was asking for God's forgiveness.

381
00:40:35,231 --> 00:40:41,487
For a secret, a secret she's
been keeping, even from Max.

382
00:40:41,907 --> 00:40:43,972
What secret?

383
00:40:44,766 --> 00:40:49,190
<i>"A gruesome discovery was made today
outside the tunnel near Welsham, Main".</i>

384
00:40:49,191 --> 00:40:54,466
<i>"The body of 17 years old girl was found
in an abandoned car near the local rock core".</i>

385
00:40:54,467 --> 00:40:57,556
<i>"The authorities are holding
a young man for questioning".</i>

386
00:41:04,905 --> 00:41:07,011
Oh my God!

387
00:41:08,765 --> 00:41:11,342
Vince, don't sneak up on me, OK?

388
00:41:11,988 --> 00:41:14,344
Did you hear that?

389
00:41:16,581 --> 00:41:18,498
No.

390
00:41:20,885 --> 00:41:23,115
Oh... it was nothing.

391
00:41:26,632 --> 00:41:28,943
What's the matter, princess?

392
00:41:31,415 --> 00:41:34,973
- It's about Sidney, I could have saved him.
- What?

393
00:41:34,993 --> 00:41:38,772
Wait... that wasn't your fault.

394
00:41:39,425 --> 00:41:41,427
It's not your fault, baby.

395
00:41:41,428 --> 00:41:43,474
Thank you, Vince.

396
00:41:43,698 --> 00:41:46,062
Have you ever missed me?

397
00:41:46,335 --> 00:41:48,005
No, can I go?

398
00:41:48,006 --> 00:41:50,004
Sometimes, I miss you.

399
00:41:50,352 --> 00:41:54,306
You asshole, you swear, you weren't
gonna say anything.

400
00:41:54,307 --> 00:41:57,025
A deal is a deal. OK?

401
00:41:57,210 --> 00:42:01,599
- But you have been keeping secrets.
- What secrets?

402
00:42:01,605 --> 00:42:04,813
I know about our baby, and what you did.

403
00:42:04,814 --> 00:42:10,498
- How? I never told anybody.
- Then, why you shouldn't tell me?

404
00:42:12,264 --> 00:42:14,686
Vince, it was a mistake.

405
00:42:14,788 --> 00:42:20,382
It's OK... I just want you one more time.

406
00:42:20,383 --> 00:42:24,690
Rox, if Max knew what you did...

407
00:42:24,994 --> 00:42:29,199
you think he would still see you as a fit mother?

408
00:42:45,442 --> 00:42:47,479
Our secret.

409
00:42:47,755 --> 00:42:50,356
Our secret.

410
00:43:20,798 --> 00:43:22,700
Your call was a disaster.

411
00:43:22,701 --> 00:43:25,784
I know, it was a mess.
The damn kid is a handful...

412
00:43:25,785 --> 00:43:29,779
- I didn't ask you for a report card.
- Yeah.

413
00:43:30,922 --> 00:43:33,216
Obviously we're not arranging a drop today.

414
00:43:33,217 --> 00:43:35,440
Your reason I had to drive 5 hours to hear that?

415
00:43:35,441 --> 00:43:40,814
Well, Max, If you were able to provide proof
of life, we wouldn't have this problem.

416
00:43:40,909 --> 00:43:42,938
See what's in front of you?

417
00:43:42,939 --> 00:43:49,175
Alones box.
You know what inspired him?... Death!

418
00:43:49,176 --> 00:43:50,177
What's this got to do with it?

419
00:43:50,178 --> 00:43:55,942
It doesn't have anything to do with it.
You only got one choice now. Kill the kid!

420
00:43:55,943 --> 00:43:57,938
You hired me to grab the kid, not kill him.

421
00:43:57,939 --> 00:44:00,544
We made one bad call, we'll call again.

422
00:44:00,545 --> 00:44:04,492
The mother will pay, any parent would pay.

423
00:44:05,595 --> 00:44:08,056
We're not done until we get our money.
You got me?

424
00:44:08,057 --> 00:44:11,060
No, you don't get me, Max!
You will do what I tell you.

425
00:44:11,061 --> 00:44:12,812
Be prepared to dispose of the body.

426
00:44:12,813 --> 00:44:15,154
You got to be aware of all the possibilities.

427
00:44:15,155 --> 00:44:17,918
I'm not killing anyone, and sure as
hell not an 8 year old.

428
00:44:17,919 --> 00:44:20,252
Huh! If only you knew who you're dealing with.

429
00:44:20,253 --> 00:44:26,213
Listen, Jones! I don't give a damn
who you are, I ain't doing it.

430
00:44:26,545 --> 00:44:28,983
The last thing I would do, is cut
off his ear and send it to his mom..

431
00:44:28,984 --> 00:44:31,445
Less effective than one might think.

432
00:44:31,446 --> 00:44:36,703
Return the phone, we'll meet tomorrow morning
for the last time, at your restaurant.

433
00:45:31,598 --> 00:45:32,869
- What's the deal, Jones?
- What?

434
00:45:32,870 --> 00:45:36,200
Jones? I'm not Jones, I don't know
what you're talking about, I swear!

435
00:45:36,201 --> 00:45:40,157
What the hell is this? Huh?

436
00:45:47,001 --> 00:45:50,157
I'm not Jones, man, I don't know any Jones.

437
00:45:50,158 --> 00:45:51,488
Then who the hell is calling me?

438
00:45:51,489 --> 00:45:56,577
Somebody said he'll pay me, OK? To put the phone back and pick it up once he was done with it

439
00:45:57,746 --> 00:46:01,157
The guy that paid you, what's he look like?

440
00:49:09,947 --> 00:49:12,036
- What did you do?
- Waugh...

441
00:49:31,019 --> 00:49:33,280
It stays you remember?

442
00:49:34,123 --> 00:49:36,722
- Hey, kid.
- Abrakazzam!

443
00:49:36,723 --> 00:49:38,818
That's very cute, give it here.

444
00:49:38,819 --> 00:49:42,031
- I give to Max when I tell him.
- Tell him what?

445
00:49:42,032 --> 00:49:44,784
About you and Roxanne.

446
00:49:44,786 --> 00:49:46,917
Oh... Check.

447
00:49:51,619 --> 00:49:56,851
You like games, huh?... I know a game.

448
00:50:03,205 --> 00:50:05,921
Come on... down there.

449
00:50:12,440 --> 00:50:14,437
David?

450
00:50:14,917 --> 00:50:16,470
So, where're we going?

451
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:20,125
To play my game, OK?
I'm gonna show you something.

452
00:50:21,549 --> 00:50:25,270
Alright... stop right there... Ok.

453
00:50:26,552 --> 00:50:28,865
You see that? Through the trees?

454
00:50:28,866 --> 00:50:31,189
Just keep looking.

455
00:50:35,432 --> 00:50:38,573
- I don't like this game.
- Are you gonna cry?

456
00:50:42,996 --> 00:50:46,128
- Huh?
- Oh... I thought you might need that.

457
00:50:51,734 --> 00:50:54,048
No!... Ohhh...

458
00:50:57,419 --> 00:50:59,482
Got some more to say? Huh?!

459
00:51:00,529 --> 00:51:03,379
Please... don't kill me.

460
00:51:15,777 --> 00:51:19,228
I told you... you don't have it in you.

461
00:51:20,307 --> 00:51:22,887
David! Come back here!

462
00:51:22,888 --> 00:51:24,806
David?

463
00:51:25,576 --> 00:51:27,652
David!

464
00:51:38,430 --> 00:51:40,299
David?

465
00:51:46,630 --> 00:51:47,899
Hey!

466
00:52:06,854 --> 00:52:09,222
Your move, Vince.

467
00:52:23,154 --> 00:52:25,154
Very clever.

468
00:52:31,879 --> 00:52:34,550
I'm just gonna wait here.

469
00:52:35,255 --> 00:52:39,787
Well, you see, the longer you make me wait...

470
00:52:46,201 --> 00:52:48,238
You're done running?

471
00:52:48,272 --> 00:52:51,550
That's good, very good.

472
00:52:52,108 --> 00:52:54,582
Because, I am gonna break your legs.

473
00:52:54,583 --> 00:52:56,855
David!

474
00:53:04,814 --> 00:53:08,473
You wanna yell out for Max?
Maybe he could help you.

475
00:53:08,474 --> 00:53:10,991
But who's gonna help you?

476
00:53:10,992 --> 00:53:12,965
Are you threatening me?

477
00:53:18,042 --> 00:53:19,228
Jesús!

478
00:53:19,229 --> 00:53:21,537
No... not Jesús.

479
00:53:33,148 --> 00:53:35,041
Checkmate!

480
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:18,273
David!

481
00:54:21,203 --> 00:54:23,146
He fell!

482
00:54:34,389 --> 00:54:36,481
I got you.

483
00:54:57,378 --> 00:54:58,874
Yeah?

484
00:54:58,875 --> 00:54:59,942
It's Marla.

485
00:54:59,943 --> 00:55:05,679
FDA licensing database got a hit on a Vincent Delayo.
Looks like he filled an order for insulin two days ago.

486
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:06,881
I thought that just might work.
Where?

487
00:55:06,882 --> 00:55:12,090
Reggie’s Pharmacy, 227 Maine Street,
Welsham, Maine. I'll call Whitney now.

488
00:55:12,091 --> 00:55:13,934
Don't.

489
00:55:14,030 --> 00:55:16,267
I'll tell him for you.

490
00:55:17,024 --> 00:55:19,268
See you soon, kiddo.

491
00:55:30,046 --> 00:55:35,020
- Your eyelids look heavy.
- Dreams... bad dreams, David.

492
00:55:36,986 --> 00:55:39,163
No more Vince though.

493
00:55:45,082 --> 00:55:49,822
- That's the most horrible thing.
- Don't it make you just a little bit happy?

494
00:55:51,007 --> 00:55:56,575
Happy?... You think what happened
to Vince made me happy?

495
00:55:56,663 --> 00:55:59,261
I can see it in your eyes.

496
00:55:59,915 --> 00:56:03,691
I heard that the eyes are the windows to the soul.

497
00:56:23,166 --> 00:56:24,928
David!

498
00:56:25,198 --> 00:56:29,045
- Could you leave us a few minutes?
- No problem, Max.

499
00:56:36,206 --> 00:56:38,325
Sorry I was away.

500
00:56:38,439 --> 00:56:41,654
- Then don't go see Jones tomorrow.
- I have to get our money.

501
00:56:41,655 --> 00:56:47,324
No... baby every time you leave, something awful
happens, look, just let him go tonight, can we please...

502
00:56:47,325 --> 00:56:48,520
Rox, we need the money.

503
00:56:48,521 --> 00:56:53,124
That's what happens when everybody wins, your
friends are dead, I've no idea why we're trapped here...

504
00:56:53,125 --> 00:56:57,579
And these things I hear in the middle of night, I wake up and I feel like somebody's putting ideas in my head.

505
00:56:57,580 --> 00:57:06,262
Hey. Hey, easy baby, easy, look at me...
We're almost there.

506
00:57:13,144 --> 00:57:15,104
Where's your ring?

507
00:57:16,474 --> 00:57:18,832
I'm cleaning it.

508
00:57:23,138 --> 00:57:25,818
There's something wrong with this place.

509
00:57:25,820 --> 00:57:28,386
We leave tomorrow, I promise.

510
00:59:56,097 --> 00:59:59,967
- Oh my God, where is it?
- Looking for this?

511
01:00:02,572 --> 01:00:04,613
You lost your ring in Vince's bed, Rox.

512
01:00:04,614 --> 01:00:06,114
No, Max, you don't understand, I can explain.

513
01:00:06,115 --> 01:00:09,742
- Vince, he made me...
- ... You do what?

514
01:00:09,743 --> 01:00:13,101
Max, you were away for 3 years, and I had no one...

515
01:00:13,102 --> 01:00:16,726
And I made a mistake, and Vince
was gonna tell you but... I had...

516
01:00:19,489 --> 01:00:21,955
Max!

517
01:00:29,653 --> 01:00:31,518
Can I come, Max?

518
01:00:36,593 --> 01:00:40,041
Max! Please let me explain...
where're you going, baby?

519
01:00:40,242 --> 01:00:42,113
- To the meet.
- At 7 at night?

520
01:00:42,114 --> 01:00:45,219
- I'll be there early.
- You can't leave me alone!

521
01:01:14,378 --> 01:01:16,602
Does Roxanne know, you're gonna kill me?

522
01:02:43,562 --> 01:02:45,762
Stay right there, ma'am!

523
01:02:46,569 --> 01:02:48,344
How many of you?

524
01:02:49,568 --> 01:02:51,084
I asked you a question!

525
01:02:51,085 --> 01:02:53,136
I'm alone.

526
01:02:54,049 --> 01:02:56,454
Easy, ma'am.

527
01:03:01,099 --> 01:03:06,237
You found me, Mr. Policeman, it's about
time, I didn't think that you would.

528
01:03:06,238 --> 01:03:10,864
- Everything is gonna be alright, David.
- Our life's are like stories, you know?

529
01:03:10,865 --> 01:03:15,579
There is a beginning, a middle and an end.

530
01:03:16,525 --> 01:03:23,301
That's Max's story, your story is
over here too, Mr. Policeman.

531
01:03:25,559 --> 01:03:27,961
Don't you want to know how it ends?

532
01:03:48,064 --> 01:03:50,950
<i>Police suspects child is dead</i>

533
01:03:59,148 --> 01:04:02,474
Why haven't you told him about
the bodies in the basement?

534
01:04:02,475 --> 01:04:04,316
Don't make things up.

535
01:04:04,728 --> 01:04:07,079
There's nothing down there.

536
01:04:07,808 --> 01:04:10,334
You believe me or her?

537
01:04:37,677 --> 01:04:39,730
Not another step, lady!

538
01:04:44,058 --> 01:04:47,657
Hey! Wait!... Open the door!

539
01:04:48,158 --> 01:04:50,297
You're going away for a long time.

540
01:04:53,488 --> 01:04:55,361
Open this door, lady!

541
01:04:56,821 --> 01:05:00,849
You better do something, Roxanne...
can't have babies in prison.

542
01:05:00,850 --> 01:05:02,895
This is your last chance. Open this door.

543
01:05:02,896 --> 01:05:04,691
Last chance!

544
01:05:40,033 --> 01:05:42,033
Go away, I killed that man.

545
01:05:42,034 --> 01:05:45,354
- Roxanne, you had no choice.
- I didn't want him die.

546
01:05:45,355 --> 01:05:47,746
Of course you didn't.

547
01:05:54,528 --> 01:05:56,502
It's gone.

548
01:05:58,758 --> 01:06:01,293
My whole life I had it.

549
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:09,280
What are you, David?

550
01:06:09,903 --> 01:06:11,983
I'm an Angel.

551
01:06:15,138 --> 01:06:19,791
The voices in your dreams, what did they tell you?

552
01:06:20,359 --> 01:06:23,580
They said to kill Max... but I would never...

553
01:06:23,581 --> 01:06:27,681
His soul, Roxanne, is going to hell.

554
01:06:28,305 --> 01:06:30,802
No, baby, hell is not real, it's...

555
01:06:30,803 --> 01:06:35,632
It's something parents frightened
their children with, there is no...

556
01:06:35,633 --> 01:06:39,020
- such a place.
- Are you certain?

557
01:06:42,037 --> 01:06:44,519
I've seen it, Roxanne.

558
01:06:44,677 --> 01:06:47,877
The wicked, in eternal damnation.

559
01:06:50,151 --> 01:06:54,694
- God will punish Max for his wickedness.
- Max isn't like that.

560
01:06:54,695 --> 01:06:58,077
Not yet, but he wants to kill me.

561
01:06:58,078 --> 01:07:01,715
- The death of an Angel...
- No, he would never.

562
01:07:06,084 --> 01:07:09,126
Eternal damnation, Roxanne.

563
01:07:09,127 --> 01:07:12,831
Please, David, I'll do anything.

564
01:07:13,053 --> 01:07:15,458
Would you kill him?

565
01:07:15,459 --> 01:07:17,875
To save his soul?

566
01:07:19,215 --> 01:07:23,063
Would you kill him... for him?

567
01:07:40,528 --> 01:07:46,243
While you decide, can you help me with
the fire? I'm too young to play with matches.

568
01:08:03,424 --> 01:08:06,648
Sam! Go away from there.

569
01:08:22,447 --> 01:08:26,041
Our business is nearly concluded.

570
01:08:26,042 --> 01:08:28,164
I know you're watching me.

571
01:08:28,165 --> 01:08:30,145
I'm not playing this game anymore.

572
01:08:30,146 --> 01:08:37,295
Good, this is a business deal... you will hold up
your end, with a bullet in the back of his head.

573
01:08:37,296 --> 01:08:40,111
That's not the deal I made.

574
01:08:40,569 --> 01:08:46,734
How dare you hang up on me?
You had a bad 4 days with David, Max?

575
01:08:46,735 --> 01:08:49,324
Try 8 years?

576
01:08:56,183 --> 01:08:58,536
You're Jones?

577
01:08:59,005 --> 01:09:03,106
There's enough here for more than just
a down payment, don't you think?

578
01:09:03,107 --> 01:09:07,082
- I'm not gonna murder a little boy.
- That is the last thing he is.

579
01:09:07,083 --> 01:09:10,329
Do you really think he is human?

580
01:09:17,616 --> 01:09:24,819
We have something in common you and I... we both
let a wolf in our home and locked the door behind it.

581
01:09:24,820 --> 01:09:27,631
When I adopted him, I thought
I'd have the life I always wanted.

582
01:09:27,632 --> 01:09:31,119
But I had no idea, what he is capable of.

583
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:35,192
Or all the ways he can get to you.
I'll give up all I have to get rid of him.

584
01:09:35,193 --> 01:09:39,854
He just gets inside your head and
he whispers these horrible thoughts...

585
01:09:39,855 --> 01:09:43,729
and paints these visions you can't escape.

586
01:09:43,730 --> 01:09:45,291
He is getting stronger, Max.

587
01:09:45,292 --> 01:09:51,192
And I have no idea what he could be capable
of in a year or a week or even now...

588
01:09:51,193 --> 01:09:56,269
and he's not gonna stop, until all of us are dead.

589
01:09:56,270 --> 01:10:00,877
Who's watching him over right now?
He killed his own father. He killed his last nanny.

590
01:10:00,878 --> 01:10:03,364
Do you not think he's going to kill her?

591
01:10:03,365 --> 01:10:10,148
Listen to me, I'm begging you...
please, kill him.

592
01:10:10,149 --> 01:10:13,059
You hired the wrong guy.

593
01:10:13,060 --> 01:10:15,077
No, please.

594
01:10:24,774 --> 01:10:25,709
I'm sorry.

595
01:10:34,233 --> 01:10:37,306
I'm sorry.

596
01:10:54,091 --> 01:10:56,917
Come on, come on... come on.

597
01:11:01,477 --> 01:11:04,854
<i>I'm sorry, you have reached a number...</i>

598
01:11:44,150 --> 01:11:48,484
Shhh... Do you hear that, Roxanne?

599
01:11:49,305 --> 01:11:51,253
Hear what, baby?

600
01:11:52,005 --> 01:11:55,121
Bad man coming.

601
01:12:23,041 --> 01:12:25,306
Rox?

602
01:12:28,073 --> 01:12:30,259
Rox!

603
01:12:30,482 --> 01:12:33,027
What're you gonna do to, David?

604
01:12:33,555 --> 01:12:35,343
Nothing.

605
01:12:38,070 --> 01:12:43,242
Max, say you forgive me.

606
01:12:43,836 --> 01:12:46,113
Of course I forgive you.

607
01:13:04,811 --> 01:13:07,273
Hide, David!

608
01:13:18,841 --> 01:13:21,051
<i>Get the gun, Max.</i>

609
01:13:21,052 --> 01:13:23,079
<i>Take the cop's gun.</i>

610
01:13:23,080 --> 01:13:25,498
<i>Run.</i>

611
01:13:42,101 --> 01:13:43,269
Put the gun down, Rox.

612
01:13:43,270 --> 01:13:46,311
We can get otta here and leave all of this behind us.

613
01:13:59,548 --> 01:14:02,259
You.

614
01:14:58,509 --> 01:15:00,049
David!

615
01:15:00,050 --> 01:15:02,021
No!

616
01:15:05,112 --> 01:15:08,014
Max!

617
01:15:08,069 --> 01:15:10,129
For your soul, Max!

618
01:15:57,030 --> 01:16:00,081
- David, come to me!
- Get otta here, Rox!

619
01:16:16,282 --> 01:16:18,121
<i>Over here.</i>

620
01:16:18,122 --> 01:16:19,560
<i>Come and get me.</i>

621
01:16:19,561 --> 01:16:20,904
<i>Look</i>

622
01:16:20,905 --> 01:16:23,207
<i>Hey, Max.</i>

623
01:16:23,208 --> 01:16:25,818
<i>Behind you.</i>

624
01:16:27,208 --> 01:16:29,818
<i>Can't you see me?</i>

625
01:16:30,208 --> 01:16:32,818
<i>Over here.</i>

626
01:16:38,719 --> 01:16:41,079
Nice shot, Max.

627
01:16:50,937 --> 01:16:53,355
Good God, Rox!

628
01:16:57,027 --> 01:16:58,834
You can't leave me.

629
01:16:58,835 --> 01:17:00,866
Don't...

630
01:17:00,867 --> 01:17:03,408
Rox... I'm sorry.

631
01:17:07,863 --> 01:17:10,315
Rox!

632
01:17:11,128 --> 01:17:13,287
Oh, no!

633
01:17:13,288 --> 01:17:15,763
Rox!

634
01:17:18,143 --> 01:17:20,358
Ohh...

635
01:17:25,143 --> 01:17:27,358
Oh... no, no, no.

636
01:17:28,207 --> 01:17:30,919
I'm just getting started here.

637
01:17:32,003 --> 01:17:36,030
Poor Roxanne... she thought I was an Angel.

638
01:17:36,031 --> 01:17:38,537
You can't kill an Angel.

639
01:17:40,074 --> 01:17:45,136
- A demon, maybe.
- Oh... what's a demon? One of the angel to fall.

640
01:17:45,137 --> 01:17:50,014
Like you're gonna fall, Max...
Don't look so sad, killer.

641
01:17:50,015 --> 01:17:55,995
You're on a winning team now.
No commandments. No guilt.

642
01:17:57,844 --> 01:18:00,528
I was sent for those who're desperate.

643
01:18:04,264 --> 01:18:09,363
I come to them when they're weak...
When their life’s are hopeless.

644
01:18:09,364 --> 01:18:12,105
When those they love reject them.

645
01:18:14,841 --> 01:18:23,395
I come to them, whisper into their ear,
and I can be very convincing.

646
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:30,114
Why, David?

647
01:18:30,708 --> 01:18:34,168
- Why all this?
- Casting for souls, Max.

648
01:18:34,169 --> 01:18:36,291
That's what I do.

649
01:18:36,292 --> 01:18:40,119
And me?... What do I do?

650
01:18:40,120 --> 01:18:46,771
You're as weak as the rest of them, so,
be a good boy and put the gun to your head.

651
01:18:51,193 --> 01:18:56,327
Do it... or hear my voice every moment of your life.

652
01:19:07,448 --> 01:19:10,000
It was a good game, Max.

653
01:21:17,497 --> 01:21:21,414
Good game, Max... but it's not over.

654
01:21:25,670 --> 01:21:28,688
Yeah, David... It is.

655
01:21:36,322 --> 01:21:40,692
- Rox?
- You can't kill an angel, Max.

656
01:21:52,451 --> 01:21:54,666
They will always be with you, Max.

657
01:21:54,683 --> 01:21:56,992
Always.

658
01:23:03,424 --> 01:23:05,618
Ho! Ho! Ho!

659
01:23:05,619 --> 01:23:08,587
Merry Christmas! Ho! Ho!

660
01:23:09,209 --> 01:23:12,213
Bless you... Merry Christmas.

661
01:23:13,624 --> 01:23:17,118
Ho! Ho! Ho! Merry Christmas!
