1
00:00:01,523 --> 00:00:04,523
(suspenseful music)

2
00:00:45,430 --> 00:00:46,979
- 23.

3
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:48,003
- [John] Go ahead, 23.

4
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,529
- Hey, John, you wanna run me a check

5
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:54,623
on a Jersey plate D-F-M-1-4-3.

6
00:00:55,560 --> 00:00:59,245
- [John] Checking, Jersey,
Denver, Frank, Mary, 143, over.

7
00:00:59,246 --> 00:01:02,246
(suspenseful music)

8
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:06,709
All clean, Phil, no violations
or outstanding warrants.

9
00:01:06,710 --> 00:01:08,769
- Uh huh, all the same, John,

10
00:01:08,770 --> 00:01:10,559
if you got a car in the area, send 'em by.

11
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:12,669
I got a feeling on this.

12
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:14,150
- [John] They're on their way.

13
00:01:14,151 --> 00:01:15,612
(suspenseful music)

14
00:01:15,613 --> 00:01:18,280
(siren wailing)

15
00:01:21,389 --> 00:01:24,389
(suspenseful music)

16
00:01:47,307 --> 00:01:50,030
- Can I see your license
and registration, please?

17
00:01:55,583 --> 00:01:59,069
Would you step out of
the van, please, sir.

18
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:00,570
- Is something wrong, Officer?

19
00:02:01,580 --> 00:02:03,529
- Well, your rear bumper on this side's

20
00:02:03,530 --> 00:02:04,659
hanging a little low.

21
00:02:04,660 --> 00:02:05,810
It's a definite hazard.

22
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,870
Come on, I'll show you.

23
00:02:08,994 --> 00:02:11,994
(suspenseful music)

24
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:16,883
See what I mean?

25
00:02:16,884 --> 00:02:18,500
Over here it's...

26
00:02:18,501 --> 00:02:21,359
(suspenseful music)

27
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,360
Tell your friends to get out of the van.

28
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:25,743
Do it nice and cheery like.

29
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:32,423
- Frank, Perry, I need you a sec!

30
00:02:34,100 --> 00:02:35,113
- Step back with me.

31
00:02:36,276 --> 00:02:39,276
(suspenseful music)

32
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:43,703
Get down on your knees!

33
00:02:43,704 --> 00:02:46,207
Put your hand behind your head, now!

34
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:49,686
You too.

35
00:02:49,687 --> 00:02:50,650
Get down on your knees.

36
00:02:50,651 --> 00:02:52,250
Put your hands behind your head.

37
00:03:01,088 --> 00:03:01,988
- [Trooper] You too, pal.

38
00:03:01,989 --> 00:03:04,065
- [Phil] Check it anyway.

39
00:03:04,066 --> 00:03:04,899
- [Trooper] Lift this one up.

40
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:07,281
- [Officer] Yeah, check
under the front seat.

41
00:03:07,282 --> 00:03:08,893
- [Trooper] What've we got?

42
00:03:08,894 --> 00:03:12,894
- [Officer] Oh yeah,
what've got the goods here.

43
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,740
- Hey (chuckles).
- [Mike] Hey.

44
00:03:15,741 --> 00:03:16,743
- What are you doing here?

45
00:03:16,744 --> 00:03:17,603
- Well, when I heard it was you,

46
00:03:17,604 --> 00:03:19,869
I figured I'd better stop by
see if you were still breathing

47
00:03:19,870 --> 00:03:21,563
chasing around like this at your age.

48
00:03:21,564 --> 00:03:22,496
- Yeah (chuckles).

49
00:03:22,496 --> 00:03:23,329
- What do ya got?

50
00:03:23,330 --> 00:03:25,889
- Oh, about five or 600 pounds of grass.

51
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:27,299
Weighed down the back end so far,

52
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:29,549
I could see sparks flying.

53
00:03:29,550 --> 00:03:31,649
All these jerks needed
was a decent vehicle.

54
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:33,100
They would've been home free.

55
00:03:34,110 --> 00:03:35,499
They make it too easy.

56
00:03:35,500 --> 00:03:36,955
- Only for you, Phil.

57
00:03:36,956 --> 00:03:37,950
(Phil chuckles)

58
00:03:37,951 --> 00:03:40,123
So ah, you still coming by Saturday?

59
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:43,807
That sink drains any slower,
Jenny's gonna divorce me.

60
00:03:43,808 --> 00:03:44,889
- Surprised she hasn't already.

61
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:46,529
She's a tough woman.

62
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:47,639
Don't worry, I'll be there.

63
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:48,698
- All right.

64
00:03:48,699 --> 00:03:49,532
- Take care, huh?

65
00:03:49,532 --> 00:03:50,532
- Yeah.

66
00:03:51,803 --> 00:03:54,959
- All right, kids, who
wants to see a magic trick?

67
00:03:54,960 --> 00:03:56,259
Come on, let's go, over to the table!

68
00:03:56,260 --> 00:03:58,517
Everybody move it, let's go, ooh hoo!

69
00:04:00,070 --> 00:04:01,759
It's time for the magic!

70
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:04,179
Behold, the Amazing Dickie!

71
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,123
We have a glass of water.

72
00:04:07,010 --> 00:04:09,803
We have a second glass of water.

73
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:13,289
We have a third glass of water.

74
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:14,839
One cup is empty.

75
00:04:14,840 --> 00:04:16,099
Two cups is empty.

76
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:17,230
Three cups, oh!

77
00:04:17,231 --> 00:04:18,469
(Carol laughs)

78
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:21,039
No water, what happened, huh (laughing)?

79
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:22,519
The Amazing Dickie, yeah, let's hear it!

80
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:24,943
- Who's hungry, burgers are on!

81
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:29,010
- Over to the table, let's go,
over to the table (laughing)!

82
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:34,059
- We've become slaves to
the computer, you know?

83
00:04:34,060 --> 00:04:35,569
I mean, I'm standing at
the checkout counter,

84
00:04:35,570 --> 00:04:38,369
and I, and I count out the
proper change, you know?

85
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,859
I prove beyond a reasonable doubt

86
00:04:39,860 --> 00:04:43,379
that 20 minus 11.50 is 8.50,

87
00:04:43,380 --> 00:04:45,056
and all this girl can do
is stare at me and say,

88
00:04:45,057 --> 00:04:45,937
"Well, I'm sorry, sir.

89
00:04:45,938 --> 00:04:48,066
"The computer says the
proper change is $6.

90
00:04:48,067 --> 00:04:49,855
"You want me to call the manager?"

91
00:04:49,856 --> 00:04:51,149
(Patty laughing)

92
00:04:51,150 --> 00:04:52,259
Like it's appalling, you know?

93
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:54,759
It's ah, it's terrifying is what it is.

94
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:56,209
- What's appalling mean?

95
00:04:56,210 --> 00:04:58,889
- It means this country
has created in its brains,

96
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:01,019
and simple deductive powers of reasoning

97
00:05:01,020 --> 00:05:02,802
are for computer chips.

98
00:05:02,803 --> 00:05:03,969
(Gregory chuckles)

99
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:06,449
- It means awful, honey.

100
00:05:06,450 --> 00:05:11,450
- Oh, you mean like Dad's potato
salad is really appalling?

101
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,502
(everyone laughing loudly)

102
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:18,510
- Coffee?

103
00:05:20,950 --> 00:05:24,003
- It's all about timing,
timing and precision.

104
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,689
Now, let's go over it.

105
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,639
The time it'll take the bank
staff to unload the cash,

106
00:05:29,640 --> 00:05:32,169
leave the vaults open and vulnerable,

107
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:34,159
between three and five minutes

108
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:37,853
after the armored car guard
comes out and drives away.

109
00:05:37,854 --> 00:05:41,259
It's 30 to 45 seconds until
they turn onto Crawford.

110
00:05:41,260 --> 00:05:42,110
Gregory.

111
00:05:42,111 --> 00:05:45,409
- As insurance, I'm at the
corner of Grand and Crawford.

112
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,789
When they pass by, I signal Jaan.

113
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:48,623
- Jaan.

114
00:05:48,624 --> 00:05:50,499
- My police scanners are
tuned to their frequencies

115
00:05:50,500 --> 00:05:53,709
in Portland, Cumberland
county, Maine Sate Troopers.

116
00:05:53,710 --> 00:05:55,949
Any one of them happen by
the area, I'll know about it.

117
00:05:55,950 --> 00:05:56,783
- Dickie.

118
00:05:56,784 --> 00:05:57,929
- Yeah, I'm stashing the safe car

119
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:00,209
1.3 miles outta town on Route Nine

120
00:06:00,210 --> 00:06:03,229
behind an abandoned factory I found.

121
00:06:03,230 --> 00:06:04,429
Thank you.

122
00:06:04,430 --> 00:06:07,606
Oh, and the ah, the backup car
is at the drive-in theater.

123
00:06:07,607 --> 00:06:08,440
- [Ray] Carol?

124
00:06:08,441 --> 00:06:09,659
- I didn't like the pickup in the car,

125
00:06:09,660 --> 00:06:13,129
so I worked on the engines
in the getaway and the safe.

126
00:06:13,130 --> 00:06:17,153
Drive off into the sunset,
we'll kick up a little dust.

127
00:06:17,154 --> 00:06:18,329
(all chuckle)

128
00:06:18,330 --> 00:06:20,269
- Chalk up one more for the good guys.

129
00:06:20,270 --> 00:06:24,483
- Well done, if all revolutions
went as smoothly as ours,

130
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,191
wouldn't need revolutions.

131
00:06:27,192 --> 00:06:29,334
(weapon clicks)

132
00:06:29,335 --> 00:06:32,335
(suspenseful music)

133
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:59,371
What's the word, Gregory, yes or no?

134
00:06:59,372 --> 00:07:02,999
(suspenseful music)

135
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:04,000
- Yes.

136
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:06,205
- Jaan?

137
00:07:06,206 --> 00:07:09,389
(suspenseful music)

138
00:07:09,390 --> 00:07:10,390
- Yes.

139
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:13,942
- Go.

140
00:07:13,943 --> 00:07:17,612
(suspenseful music)

141
00:07:17,613 --> 00:07:18,753
- Hit the floor!

142
00:07:18,754 --> 00:07:19,994
Do it now, now!

143
00:07:19,995 --> 00:07:21,422
- Get down on the ground, everybody!

144
00:07:21,423 --> 00:07:23,006
You, on the ground!

145
00:07:24,371 --> 00:07:26,792
You, down, down, down!

146
00:07:26,793 --> 00:07:27,626
- Get away!

147
00:07:27,626 --> 00:07:28,544
- [Ray] On the ground, let's go, down!

148
00:07:28,545 --> 00:07:31,711
- You heard him, ground
now, stay there, stay there!

149
00:07:31,712 --> 00:07:34,053
- Down on the ground
everybody, down, down, down!

150
00:07:34,054 --> 00:07:35,732
- You wanna die today, huh?

151
00:07:35,733 --> 00:07:38,166
Get down and stay there!

152
00:07:38,167 --> 00:07:40,417
- Hey, keep your head down!

153
00:07:42,197 --> 00:07:44,705
All right, what're you looking at, huh?

154
00:07:44,706 --> 00:07:46,792
You wanna be a hero?

155
00:07:46,793 --> 00:07:50,629
- [Jaan] Very good, people,
very nice, no movement.

156
00:07:50,630 --> 00:07:53,630
(suspenseful music)

157
00:08:01,231 --> 00:08:02,231
Come on now!

158
00:08:03,211 --> 00:08:06,019
(alarm wailing)

159
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,746
- My God, did you see that?

160
00:08:07,747 --> 00:08:08,580
(tires screeching)

161
00:08:08,581 --> 00:08:10,529
I'm going after 'em!

162
00:08:10,530 --> 00:08:11,363
Call the station!

163
00:08:11,364 --> 00:08:13,724
Tell 'em two men just
robbed the bank on 7th!

164
00:08:13,725 --> 00:08:15,524
I am in pursuit of a blue station wagon!

165
00:08:15,525 --> 00:08:17,489
(alarm wailing)

166
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:19,339
(tires screeching)

167
00:08:19,340 --> 00:08:20,216
(suspenseful music)

168
00:08:20,217 --> 00:08:21,644
(tires screeching)

169
00:08:21,645 --> 00:08:22,698
(horn blowing)

170
00:08:22,699 --> 00:08:27,699
(tires screeching)
(suspenseful music)

171
00:08:29,668 --> 00:08:31,149
- What, it's about
another mile and something

172
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,060
up here, Dickie?

173
00:08:32,061 --> 00:08:34,099
- No, no, it's right up here
around the second corner.

174
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:35,959
- Wait a minute, what,
what, that's too close!

175
00:08:35,960 --> 00:08:38,267
- No, no, now look, I
switched locations, man.

176
00:08:38,268 --> 00:08:39,959
There was an excavation
crew there this morning

177
00:08:39,960 --> 00:08:40,999
when I stashed the car.

178
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:41,833
- You didn't tell us?

179
00:08:41,834 --> 00:08:43,309
- [Dickie] Well, it's a
last minute thing, man.

180
00:08:43,310 --> 00:08:44,629
I didn't have time, I forgot.

181
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:46,109
- You forgot, how the
hell could you forget

182
00:08:46,110 --> 00:08:47,289
something like that, huh?

183
00:08:47,290 --> 00:08:48,210
- All right, that's enough right now!

184
00:08:48,211 --> 00:08:50,414
I got a guy on my ass back there!

185
00:08:50,415 --> 00:08:53,166
(suspenseful music)

186
00:08:53,167 --> 00:08:54,431
Just go to the backup.

187
00:08:54,432 --> 00:08:57,432
(suspenseful music)

188
00:09:03,202 --> 00:09:04,545
- He has to be a cop!

189
00:09:04,546 --> 00:09:07,546
(suspenseful music)

190
00:09:10,125 --> 00:09:12,542
(gun firing)

191
00:09:14,719 --> 00:09:16,886
- Stop it, stop firing!

192
00:09:16,887 --> 00:09:18,712
(gun firing)

193
00:09:18,713 --> 00:09:22,087
(tires screeching)

194
00:09:22,088 --> 00:09:22,921
(gun firing)

195
00:09:22,922 --> 00:09:24,573
- Dickie, stop it!

196
00:09:24,574 --> 00:09:27,574
(suspenseful music)

197
00:09:46,686 --> 00:09:47,769
- You could've killed that guy!

198
00:09:47,770 --> 00:09:48,603
- That guy's all right.

199
00:09:48,603 --> 00:09:49,436
I saw him get out of the car.

200
00:09:49,437 --> 00:09:50,473
Cool it, okay?

201
00:09:50,474 --> 00:09:51,307
- No, it's not okay.

202
00:09:51,308 --> 00:09:53,349
We rob banks to finance
causes we believe in our own.

203
00:09:53,350 --> 00:09:54,330
We don't stage shootouts.

204
00:09:54,331 --> 00:09:56,100
- Hey, look, he was
gaining on us, all right?

205
00:09:56,101 --> 00:09:56,934
- I would've lost him.

206
00:09:56,935 --> 00:09:58,134
- I saved you the trouble!

207
00:09:58,135 --> 00:10:00,414
- The trouble is you didn't
stash the car as planned!

208
00:10:00,415 --> 00:10:01,829
- Look, I already told you about that!

209
00:10:01,830 --> 00:10:02,969
- That's a lousy excuse!

210
00:10:02,970 --> 00:10:04,009
Stick to the plan!

211
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:04,843
- Hey, stick this, you pompous...

212
00:10:04,844 --> 00:10:07,309
- Hey, knock it off!

213
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:08,999
We will critique this
thing in its proper forum!

214
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:11,640
Now, let's get in the car
and get the hell outta here!

215
00:10:24,040 --> 00:10:25,520
- [Officer] Check the backseat there!

216
00:10:26,628 --> 00:10:28,059
- [Male] He's got that set up.

217
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:30,269
- [Man] Bag it if you can!

218
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:33,019
- Okay, listen, I need ah,
pictures of the finished cast

219
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:35,809
sent to Washington as soon
as possible, all right?

220
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:39,879
Thank you, now, ah, Officer ah...

221
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:40,713
- Milton.

222
00:10:40,714 --> 00:10:43,415
- Milton, Milton, where'd we leave off?

223
00:10:43,416 --> 00:10:45,039
- Well, the bastards opened up on me.

224
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:47,119
I reached under the seat for my weapon.

225
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:48,849
That's when I realized
I had my wife's car,

226
00:10:48,850 --> 00:10:51,039
so I couldn't return fire.

227
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:54,599
- Okay, um, I'm gonna
have somebody call you,

228
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:57,952
and ah, take a statement, and
maybe show you some pictures.

229
00:10:57,953 --> 00:11:00,229
I thank you for your cooperation.

230
00:11:00,230 --> 00:11:03,389
- That's it, shouldn't
we be doing something?

231
00:11:03,390 --> 00:11:04,629
- Well, we are doing something.

232
00:11:04,630 --> 00:11:05,649
- Yeah, right.

233
00:11:05,650 --> 00:11:09,319
Excuse me, I mean I'm not one
of your highly trained Feds,

234
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,019
but where are the roadblocks?

235
00:11:11,020 --> 00:11:11,910
Where are the...

236
00:11:11,911 --> 00:11:14,129
- Milton, Milton, these guys are long gone

237
00:11:14,130 --> 00:11:15,349
from here by now, all right?

238
00:11:15,350 --> 00:11:16,263
Trust me on this.

239
00:11:16,264 --> 00:11:17,979
Now, do yourself a favor.

240
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,919
Forget all about this
and take your wife out

241
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:22,549
to a nice celebratory dinner, okay?

242
00:11:22,550 --> 00:11:25,749
- Celebration, what do I
have to celebrate, huh?

243
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:27,559
I almost bought the farm today!

244
00:11:27,560 --> 00:11:29,689
- Well, keyword is almost.

245
00:11:29,690 --> 00:11:31,489
You're walking, you're talking,

246
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:33,409
and ah, your wife's not a widow.

247
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,819
She even gets her car back.

248
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:36,820
Sounds like a ah, pretty good day to me.

249
00:11:39,478 --> 00:11:42,645
(engine turning over)

250
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:51,539
- Hey, you got the parts?

251
00:11:51,540 --> 00:11:52,709
- Yeah.

252
00:11:52,710 --> 00:11:53,772
- Ah, brother.

253
00:11:53,773 --> 00:11:54,606
- What?

254
00:11:54,607 --> 00:11:56,419
- [Phil] You got PVC pipe.

255
00:11:56,420 --> 00:11:57,669
- So, that's what the guy in the store

256
00:11:57,670 --> 00:11:58,989
said they use nowadays.

257
00:11:58,990 --> 00:12:00,009
- Yeah, but unfortunately,

258
00:12:00,010 --> 00:12:01,949
your house was built before World War II.

259
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:03,899
- So, what does that mean?

260
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:05,009
- He's your partner, Jimmy?

261
00:12:05,010 --> 00:12:05,843
You tell him.

262
00:12:05,844 --> 00:12:07,827
- You got galvanized pipes.

263
00:12:07,828 --> 00:12:09,129
That's what they used back then.

264
00:12:09,130 --> 00:12:09,963
- What do you want from me?

265
00:12:09,964 --> 00:12:11,019
Blame it on Clarice.

266
00:12:11,020 --> 00:12:12,239
- Who's Clarice?

267
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:13,409
- She's Gary's babysitter.

268
00:12:13,410 --> 00:12:15,089
- You sent the babysitter?

269
00:12:15,090 --> 00:12:15,923
- I didn't have time.

270
00:12:15,924 --> 00:12:17,279
I'm a detective, remember?

271
00:12:17,280 --> 00:12:19,289
Duty calls, I go work.

272
00:12:19,290 --> 00:12:20,889
You should know that better than anybody.

273
00:12:20,890 --> 00:12:23,479
- Okay, so Saturday I'll
pick up the right parts,

274
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:25,189
and head over to your place.

275
00:12:25,190 --> 00:12:26,023
Will Gary be there?

276
00:12:26,024 --> 00:12:27,219
- He should be, why?

277
00:12:27,220 --> 00:12:29,219
- Wanna show him how to fix the sink.

278
00:12:29,220 --> 00:12:32,783
This way, gradually, slowly,
over time, he can teach you.

279
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:35,066
- I appreciate that.

280
00:12:35,067 --> 00:12:38,511
(telephone ringing)

281
00:12:38,512 --> 00:12:41,512
(suspenseful music)

282
00:13:08,040 --> 00:13:09,809
- This is the United Freedom Front.

283
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:12,009
A bomb has been placed on your premises.

284
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:14,549
It will go off in 45 minutes.

285
00:13:14,550 --> 00:13:16,429
Keep everyone away.

286
00:13:16,430 --> 00:13:18,188
Power to the people.

287
00:13:18,189 --> 00:13:21,189
(suspenseful music)

288
00:13:23,150 --> 00:13:25,359
- Your favorite terrorists
just phoned in a bomb threat

289
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,369
to a compressor station in New Hampshire.

290
00:13:27,370 --> 00:13:28,260
- What time?

291
00:13:28,261 --> 00:13:30,889
- 8:15, a security guard took the call.

292
00:13:30,890 --> 00:13:32,169
He's keeping the area clear.

293
00:13:32,170 --> 00:13:34,571
- Well, if this thing goes
off with the usual precision,

294
00:13:34,572 --> 00:13:36,582
it all oughta be over in about a minute.

295
00:13:36,583 --> 00:13:39,182
(suspenseful music)

296
00:13:39,183 --> 00:13:42,433
(thunderous explosion)

297
00:13:49,257 --> 00:13:52,007
(birds chirping)

298
00:13:55,774 --> 00:13:58,524
(engine roaring)

299
00:14:02,968 --> 00:14:05,342
(tires screeching)

300
00:14:05,343 --> 00:14:08,093
(birds chirping)

301
00:14:14,649 --> 00:14:16,519
- Prison life ain't no life at all, man.

302
00:14:16,520 --> 00:14:17,686
- Yeah, tell me about it.

303
00:14:17,687 --> 00:14:19,967
- You know, somehow I'm
glad I did it though.

304
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:25,563
Che Guevara, the Berrigan
Brothers, Malcolm X,

305
00:14:26,410 --> 00:14:27,760
all of them went to prison.

306
00:14:30,285 --> 00:14:31,319
- Well, it's a little
different in your case.

307
00:14:31,320 --> 00:14:32,320
Don't you think?

308
00:14:34,180 --> 00:14:35,180
- No.

309
00:14:37,280 --> 00:14:38,280
- Okay.

310
00:14:40,866 --> 00:14:43,379
(suspenseful music)

311
00:14:43,380 --> 00:14:44,213
- What is it?

312
00:14:44,213 --> 00:14:45,213
- We've got company.

313
00:14:46,016 --> 00:14:49,016
(suspenseful music)

314
00:14:52,550 --> 00:14:53,788
Dickie, put that thing away.

315
00:14:53,789 --> 00:14:54,622
What're you doing?

316
00:14:54,623 --> 00:14:56,589
- Hey, he pulls us
over, I'm shooting, man.

317
00:14:56,590 --> 00:14:58,119
- Listen, our IDs are solid.

318
00:14:58,120 --> 00:14:59,629
He pulls us over, I start talking.

319
00:14:59,630 --> 00:15:00,663
It's no big deal.

320
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:04,216
Put it back in the glove
compartment right now.

321
00:15:04,217 --> 00:15:05,050
Let's maintain.

322
00:15:05,051 --> 00:15:07,222
(siren wailing)

323
00:15:07,223 --> 00:15:09,066
- [Dickie] It's cool, man.

324
00:15:09,067 --> 00:15:12,067
(suspenseful music)

325
00:15:28,243 --> 00:15:29,849
- May I see your license
and registration, please?

326
00:15:29,850 --> 00:15:30,850
- Sure.

327
00:15:32,510 --> 00:15:34,089
Is there a problem, Officer?

328
00:15:34,090 --> 00:15:35,789
- Got a lot of mud on that license plate.

329
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:37,599
I can't make out the numbers.

330
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:39,556
Step out of the vehicle, please.

331
00:15:39,557 --> 00:15:42,557
(suspenseful music)

332
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,437
Let's take a look.

333
00:15:54,487 --> 00:15:56,209
Do you got anything in
that trunk to clean that?

334
00:15:56,210 --> 00:15:57,462
- I'll get it.

335
00:15:57,463 --> 00:15:59,581
(suspenseful music)

336
00:15:59,582 --> 00:16:02,082
(guns firing)

337
00:16:10,972 --> 00:16:13,972
(suspenseful music)

338
00:16:15,087 --> 00:16:16,335
- Get in the car, man.

339
00:16:16,336 --> 00:16:19,729
(suspenseful music)

340
00:16:19,730 --> 00:16:23,535
Tommy, drive this thing
outta here or we're dead too!

341
00:16:23,536 --> 00:16:26,536
(suspenseful music)

342
00:16:29,646 --> 00:16:32,435
(tires screeching)

343
00:16:32,436 --> 00:16:35,436
(suspenseful music)

344
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:42,369
- Breaker breaker, they shot a cop!

345
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:44,909
On Highway 27 they shot a cop!

346
00:16:44,910 --> 00:16:47,333
- Damn, how can you be that stupid?

347
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,959
- Listen, pal, you know, you
wanna be in a revolution,

348
00:16:50,960 --> 00:16:53,765
somebody's gonna maybe die, wake up!

349
00:16:53,766 --> 00:16:56,289
- Wake up, because we don't shoot cops!

350
00:16:56,290 --> 00:16:58,696
(horn blowing)

351
00:16:58,697 --> 00:17:02,469
(suspenseful music)

352
00:17:02,470 --> 00:17:03,919
Perfect.

353
00:17:03,920 --> 00:17:05,799
- Oh, yeah, yeah (laughs)!

354
00:17:05,800 --> 00:17:07,283
- No more guns, Dickie!

355
00:17:09,511 --> 00:17:11,189
Knock it off!

356
00:17:11,190 --> 00:17:14,190
(suspenseful music)

357
00:17:37,620 --> 00:17:39,219
- Ah, they're gone.

358
00:17:39,220 --> 00:17:42,220
(suspenseful music)

359
00:18:01,460 --> 00:18:03,729
- [Dispatch] All units, I have
a report of an officer down

360
00:18:03,730 --> 00:18:07,319
just south of marker 118 on Highway 27.

361
00:18:07,320 --> 00:18:09,461
All nearby units, please respond.

362
00:18:09,462 --> 00:18:12,640
(suspenseful music)

363
00:18:12,641 --> 00:18:15,308
(siren wailing)

364
00:18:26,441 --> 00:18:27,441
- Phil!

365
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,600
Phil.

366
00:18:30,321 --> 00:18:32,470
(Phil groans)

367
00:18:32,471 --> 00:18:34,559
Hey, buddy, you're gonna make it.

368
00:18:34,560 --> 00:18:36,019
Hang in there, all right?

369
00:18:36,020 --> 00:18:37,601
You just hang in there.

370
00:18:37,602 --> 00:18:39,360
(Phil groaning)

371
00:18:39,361 --> 00:18:40,769
They're on their way.

372
00:18:40,770 --> 00:18:42,420
Don't die on me, all right, Phil?

373
00:18:43,593 --> 00:18:45,629
(sirens wailing)

374
00:18:45,630 --> 00:18:46,545
Come on buddy, come on.

375
00:18:46,546 --> 00:18:48,635
(sirens wailing)

376
00:18:48,636 --> 00:18:49,576
Come on!

377
00:18:49,577 --> 00:18:51,755
(sirens wailing)

378
00:18:51,756 --> 00:18:54,506
(engine roaring)

379
00:18:56,189 --> 00:18:58,856
(Dickie grunts)

380
00:19:01,650 --> 00:19:03,520
- We gotta get outta here, man.

381
00:19:03,521 --> 00:19:05,521
We gotta make a plan or something, okay?

382
00:19:06,860 --> 00:19:10,423
Hey, hey, where the
hell are you going, huh?

383
00:19:10,424 --> 00:19:13,259
(Dickie grunts)

384
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:15,049
- You see that shop?

385
00:19:15,050 --> 00:19:16,619
They got a phone.

386
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:19,289
With any luck Carol's home
and maybe she can come get us.

387
00:19:19,290 --> 00:19:22,240
So you stay here, keep your
eyes open, and your mouth shut.

388
00:19:24,775 --> 00:19:26,225
And try not to shoot anybody!

389
00:19:30,701 --> 00:19:32,809
(telephone ringing)
(Carol laughing)

390
00:19:32,810 --> 00:19:33,643
- Hello.

391
00:19:33,644 --> 00:19:36,397
- 5-5-5-0-1-6-5.

392
00:19:43,256 --> 00:19:45,285
(telephone ringing)

393
00:19:45,286 --> 00:19:46,119
We got troubles, Carol.

394
00:19:46,120 --> 00:19:47,319
You have to come get us.

395
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:48,153
- What happened?

396
00:19:48,153 --> 00:19:49,130
- I don't have time.

397
00:19:49,130 --> 00:19:49,963
Now, just listen.

398
00:19:49,964 --> 00:19:52,279
We're not far from the state line.

399
00:19:52,280 --> 00:19:54,649
Remember that place we took
the kids on the picnic?

400
00:19:54,650 --> 00:19:55,483
Jamie found a...

401
00:19:55,483 --> 00:19:56,370
- Found a bird's nest.

402
00:19:56,370 --> 00:19:57,270
Okay, yeah, got it.

403
00:19:57,271 --> 00:19:59,709
Ah, can I bring him, Jamie?

404
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,543
- No, leave him.

405
00:20:00,543 --> 00:20:01,480
He'll be fine.

406
00:20:01,480 --> 00:20:02,313
- Well, it's late.

407
00:20:02,313 --> 00:20:03,146
I can't just...

408
00:20:03,147 --> 00:20:06,093
- Carol, Dickie shot a cop.

409
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:09,630
- I'm on my way.

410
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:20,019
Listen, sweetie, I've gotta go get Daddy,

411
00:20:20,020 --> 00:20:21,720
and I need to leave you here, huh?

412
00:20:22,900 --> 00:20:23,894
- Okay.

413
00:20:23,895 --> 00:20:24,929
- I'm gonna lock that door behind me,

414
00:20:24,930 --> 00:20:28,213
and no matter what you don't
let anybody in you don't know.

415
00:20:28,214 --> 00:20:29,125
- Okay?

416
00:20:29,126 --> 00:20:30,280
- Okay (lips smack).

417
00:20:30,281 --> 00:20:33,530
I'll be back.

418
00:20:33,531 --> 00:20:36,698
(helicopter whirring)

419
00:20:39,951 --> 00:20:44,951
- [Officer] Found another print over here!

420
00:20:46,344 --> 00:20:47,177
- Who found it?

421
00:20:47,177 --> 00:20:48,177
- One of our patrols.

422
00:20:50,050 --> 00:20:50,883
- They touch anything?

423
00:20:50,884 --> 00:20:53,529
- No, somebody's getting
a warrant right now.

424
00:20:53,530 --> 00:20:54,952
- What do you got there?

425
00:20:54,953 --> 00:20:57,039
- A nice full palm print.

426
00:20:57,040 --> 00:20:58,740
Must've tried to push the car out.

427
00:21:00,100 --> 00:21:01,779
- From Phil's gun, huh?

428
00:21:01,780 --> 00:21:03,973
- Must have shot right from here.

429
00:21:03,974 --> 00:21:05,899
At least to got a couple of rounds off.

430
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:08,289
- Until the bastard
got one under his vest.

431
00:21:08,290 --> 00:21:10,695
(helicopter whirring)
(camera shutter clicking)

432
00:21:10,696 --> 00:21:11,529
- Come here.

433
00:21:11,530 --> 00:21:14,696
(helicopter whirring)

434
00:21:17,735 --> 00:21:21,641
(Jimmy clears throat)

435
00:21:21,642 --> 00:21:23,972
(suspenseful music)

436
00:21:23,973 --> 00:21:26,219
- A buddy of mine works for the Feds.

437
00:21:26,220 --> 00:21:27,270
Let's go wake him up.

438
00:21:29,266 --> 00:21:31,708
(door creaking)

439
00:21:31,709 --> 00:21:34,558
(suspenseful music)

440
00:21:34,559 --> 00:21:36,239
I guess it was a revenge hit, you know?

441
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:38,379
Phil busted a lot of
drug guys along the way.

442
00:21:38,380 --> 00:21:39,439
- Coffee's over there.

443
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:41,729
There's some pistachios
and stuff in the cabinet.

444
00:21:41,730 --> 00:21:43,191
Make yourselves at home.

445
00:21:43,192 --> 00:21:46,192
(suspenseful music)

446
00:22:11,100 --> 00:22:13,329
The name Eastberry on
the license is a fake.

447
00:22:13,330 --> 00:22:15,503
The address is a hotel in Connecticut.

448
00:22:17,190 --> 00:22:18,190
- What is it?

449
00:22:19,280 --> 00:22:20,280
- That hotel.

450
00:22:21,013 --> 00:22:24,013
(suspenseful music)

451
00:22:26,530 --> 00:22:27,363
This guy mean anything to you.

452
00:22:27,364 --> 00:22:29,172
He's on our top 10.

453
00:22:29,173 --> 00:22:30,017
- Who is he?

454
00:22:30,018 --> 00:22:33,419
- Raymond Levasseur, wanted
for multiple bank robberies

455
00:22:33,420 --> 00:22:34,629
in the New England area,

456
00:22:34,630 --> 00:22:37,509
weapons violations, left wing terrorist.

457
00:22:37,510 --> 00:22:39,449
- You see a connection
you wanna tell us about?

458
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:41,209
- A few months ago he
tried to get a fake ID

459
00:22:41,210 --> 00:22:42,979
using someone else's birth certificate

460
00:22:42,980 --> 00:22:44,689
in a small town in Connecticut.

461
00:22:44,690 --> 00:22:46,259
Trouble is the clerk knew the name,

462
00:22:46,260 --> 00:22:47,769
and knew the person was deceased.

463
00:22:47,770 --> 00:22:49,629
She called in the sheriff.

464
00:22:49,630 --> 00:22:50,463
When he got there,

465
00:22:50,464 --> 00:22:52,999
Levasseur pulled a nine
millimeter gun on him and ran.

466
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,239
- Same kind of gun used on Phil.

467
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,073
- Anyway, he got away,

468
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,339
and just like your guy,

469
00:22:57,340 --> 00:23:00,139
he's using the same
hotel as a home address.

470
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:02,319
- Let me try the hospital again.

471
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:04,299
- Mike, you just called 20 minutes ago.

472
00:23:04,300 --> 00:23:05,944
- Yeah, I know.

473
00:23:05,945 --> 00:23:08,862
(melancholy music)

474
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:17,274
Yeah, this is Detective Garret again.

475
00:23:17,275 --> 00:23:20,859
(melancholy music)

476
00:23:20,860 --> 00:23:21,860
Okay, thanks.

477
00:23:27,890 --> 00:23:29,390
There's no change.

478
00:23:32,170 --> 00:23:33,919
- Well, no prints come
back on Carl Eastberry.

479
00:23:33,920 --> 00:23:36,245
Let's try Levasseur.

480
00:23:36,246 --> 00:23:39,246
(suspenseful music)

481
00:23:52,150 --> 00:23:53,150
No match.

482
00:23:54,660 --> 00:23:56,010
- Punch up this guy's name.

483
00:23:56,956 --> 00:24:00,860
He's a known associate,
Thomas Manning, 36, Boston.

484
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:05,124
(computer beeping)

485
00:24:14,910 --> 00:24:17,559
- Carl Eastberry is
Thomas William Manning.

486
00:24:17,560 --> 00:24:18,849
He's your driver.

487
00:24:18,850 --> 00:24:20,449
- All right.

488
00:24:20,450 --> 00:24:21,733
Print that out for me.

489
00:24:22,700 --> 00:24:24,415
I owe you one, Mitch.

490
00:24:24,416 --> 00:24:26,259
- Hey Mike, you oughta know something.

491
00:24:26,260 --> 00:24:27,929
This case is huge.

492
00:24:27,930 --> 00:24:30,049
We've been after these
guys for seven years.

493
00:24:30,050 --> 00:24:31,539
All departments throughout the Northeast

494
00:24:31,540 --> 00:24:32,929
have been actively involved.

495
00:24:32,930 --> 00:24:33,763
- Yeah, I hear ya.

496
00:24:33,764 --> 00:24:36,803
- Hey, it's kind of a Bureau obsession.

497
00:24:37,880 --> 00:24:40,943
Walk on eggshells, Mike,
and I wasn't here tonight.

498
00:24:42,790 --> 00:24:43,790
- Gotcha.

499
00:24:49,251 --> 00:24:54,251
(officers chattering)
(telephones ringing)

500
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:03,899
- Mike.

501
00:25:03,900 --> 00:25:04,900
- Morning, sir.

502
00:25:05,693 --> 00:25:07,829
I have info on Phil's shooter.

503
00:25:07,830 --> 00:25:08,889
Jimmy and I have been up all night,

504
00:25:08,890 --> 00:25:10,466
so if we could just go
over this right away,

505
00:25:10,467 --> 00:25:13,509
and I could go home and
ah, change, take a shower,

506
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,457
check up on Phil at the hospital,

507
00:25:14,458 --> 00:25:16,286
and I could be back here in an hour, tops.

508
00:25:16,287 --> 00:25:18,710
- Mike, you don't need
to go by the hospital.

509
00:25:18,711 --> 00:25:20,129
- No, really, it's, it's on my way.

510
00:25:20,130 --> 00:25:21,230
It won't slow me down.

511
00:25:23,941 --> 00:25:26,858
(melancholy music)

512
00:25:39,320 --> 00:25:40,720
We can find these guys, sir.

513
00:25:43,510 --> 00:25:45,099
- Mike, can you step into my office?

514
00:25:45,100 --> 00:25:48,000
Jimmy, we need to go over a few things.

515
00:25:48,001 --> 00:25:50,918
(melancholy music)

516
00:25:55,550 --> 00:25:57,619
I'd like you to meet Special
Agent Gabriel Valentino

517
00:25:57,620 --> 00:25:59,416
of the Boston Bureau of the FBI.

518
00:25:59,417 --> 00:26:01,593
- I'm very sorry about Trooper Lamonaco.

519
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:07,080
- You said you had some information, Mike.

520
00:26:08,510 --> 00:26:09,510
- Yeah, um.

521
00:26:11,460 --> 00:26:13,679
- If this is about Thomas
Manning and Ray Levasseur,

522
00:26:13,680 --> 00:26:15,330
we're already well aware of that.

523
00:26:16,870 --> 00:26:19,709
- Well, great then, Boston, right?

524
00:26:19,710 --> 00:26:22,129
- Yes, it was the office of origin.

525
00:26:22,130 --> 00:26:23,629
Their first crime was the bombing

526
00:26:23,630 --> 00:26:25,969
of the courthouse in
Suffolk County, downtown.

527
00:26:25,970 --> 00:26:27,679
- Seven years ago?

528
00:26:27,680 --> 00:26:28,763
- About that, yeah.

529
00:26:30,370 --> 00:26:33,489
- That's a long time to be
tracking one group, right?

530
00:26:33,490 --> 00:26:35,299
- Well, not this particular group.

531
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,799
They're very sophisticated and elusive.

532
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:39,349
- All I'm saying is after seven years,

533
00:26:39,350 --> 00:26:40,759
these guys shouldn't
be still running around

534
00:26:40,760 --> 00:26:42,539
shooting cops is all.

535
00:26:42,540 --> 00:26:45,759
- Detective, I, I know that
you're very upset right now,

536
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:47,819
but I wouldn't mouth off about a situation

537
00:26:47,820 --> 00:26:49,003
you know nothing about.

538
00:26:51,490 --> 00:26:53,289
I suggest if you have
any pertinent questions

539
00:26:53,290 --> 00:26:56,269
for Agent Valentino
regarding this investigation,

540
00:26:56,270 --> 00:26:57,270
ask him now.

541
00:26:59,370 --> 00:27:01,470
- Hey, Agent Valentino, my friend, my ah,

542
00:27:05,670 --> 00:27:08,273
my ex-partner is dead,

543
00:27:09,460 --> 00:27:11,660
and as a cop, from a
personal point of view,

544
00:27:12,950 --> 00:27:14,539
I wanna find his murderer.

545
00:27:14,540 --> 00:27:16,203
So anything you can tell us will help.

546
00:27:23,650 --> 00:27:27,249
- Ray Levasseur is wanted
on federal warrants.

547
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:28,329
Both he and Manning are known

548
00:27:28,330 --> 00:27:30,679
to be traveling with wives and children.

549
00:27:30,680 --> 00:27:32,969
There are others in the group.

550
00:27:32,970 --> 00:27:35,889
Any one of them could
have been in the car.

551
00:27:35,890 --> 00:27:37,329
- They're terrorists?

552
00:27:37,330 --> 00:27:39,799
- They call themselves
the United Freedom Front.

553
00:27:39,800 --> 00:27:41,299
Ostensibly, they rob banks

554
00:27:41,300 --> 00:27:43,889
to finance their political agenda.

555
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:44,723
As far as we know,

556
00:27:44,724 --> 00:27:46,229
they have no connection to any

557
00:27:46,230 --> 00:27:49,709
of the better known
groups, STS, Weathermen.

558
00:27:49,710 --> 00:27:51,879
Levasseur is a Vietnam Vet,

559
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:54,939
did two years in Tennessee
on marijuana charges.

560
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,703
Thomas Manning did five
years in Massachusetts.

561
00:27:58,783 --> 00:27:59,949
- That's it?

562
00:27:59,950 --> 00:28:02,311
- That's all I can share
with you at this time.

563
00:28:02,312 --> 00:28:03,769
- That ain't a whole hell of a lot.

564
00:28:03,770 --> 00:28:04,720
- You have any problem with my men

565
00:28:04,721 --> 00:28:06,699
investigating this as a local homicide?

566
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:08,809
- Mm, no, not at all.

567
00:28:08,810 --> 00:28:11,380
Just so long as they understand
we're running the show.

568
00:28:14,812 --> 00:28:16,249
Okay.

569
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:17,702
- Hey, Valentino.

570
00:28:17,703 --> 00:28:18,749
- [Gabriel] Yeah.

571
00:28:18,750 --> 00:28:20,999
- You could run the show all you want,

572
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:24,869
but remember, the star,
the one who got killed,

573
00:28:24,870 --> 00:28:26,003
he was one of us.

574
00:28:27,460 --> 00:28:29,650
- Okay, I'll remember that.

575
00:28:31,858 --> 00:28:34,275
(door thuds)

576
00:28:35,178 --> 00:28:40,069
- (sighs) Mike, we're working
on a 27 hour day here.

577
00:28:40,070 --> 00:28:41,573
Think it's the time we go home?

578
00:28:42,728 --> 00:28:43,728
- Yeah.

579
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,269
- [Jaan] Put that up by the front.

580
00:28:50,270 --> 00:28:52,512
- [Ray] All, all the heavy
weight goes over the axle.

581
00:28:52,513 --> 00:28:53,652
- [Jaan] All right.

582
00:28:53,653 --> 00:28:54,533
- [Ray] Pat it around?

583
00:28:54,533 --> 00:28:55,366
- [Jaan] Yep.

584
00:28:55,367 --> 00:28:57,033
- [Ray] Turn it off?

585
00:29:06,960 --> 00:29:08,260
- Everything okay?

586
00:29:08,261 --> 00:29:09,261
- Barely.

587
00:29:11,057 --> 00:29:13,059
- Any trouble at the house?

588
00:29:13,060 --> 00:29:14,749
- We didn't stick around
long enough to find out.

589
00:29:14,750 --> 00:29:17,189
We just threw some clothes
in a bag and split.

590
00:29:17,190 --> 00:29:18,809
- We left everything
we owned at that house.

591
00:29:18,810 --> 00:29:20,479
- [Ray] Well, that's
the nature of the beast.

592
00:29:20,480 --> 00:29:22,083
- No, Ray, I don't think it is.

593
00:29:24,390 --> 00:29:26,129
- All right, we need to talk this through.

594
00:29:26,130 --> 00:29:28,948
We need to be outta here within 24 hours!

595
00:29:28,949 --> 00:29:30,679
- Well, well, what about the shooting?

596
00:29:30,680 --> 00:29:32,239
- Hey, hey, I'm not gonna stand around,

597
00:29:32,240 --> 00:29:33,879
and take a lot of crap
from all of you for this.

598
00:29:33,880 --> 00:29:35,219
- Yes, Dickie, you are!

599
00:29:35,220 --> 00:29:37,909
- Our agenda is to attack
establishment targets.

600
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:39,839
That's buildings, not people.

601
00:29:39,840 --> 00:29:40,899
It's not cops.

602
00:29:40,900 --> 00:29:42,909
- Hey, man, cops get killed.

603
00:29:42,910 --> 00:29:46,899
- But not by us, and this
killing was unfortunate.

604
00:29:46,900 --> 00:29:49,450
It elevated our fugitive
status and it's a problem,

605
00:29:50,720 --> 00:29:52,783
but it happened and we can't take it back.

606
00:29:53,770 --> 00:29:55,399
So we move on.

607
00:29:55,400 --> 00:29:56,859
Does anybody disagree with the notion

608
00:29:56,860 --> 00:29:58,999
that we continue the way we always have,

609
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,450
and that we consider this
incident an aberration?

610
00:30:06,530 --> 00:30:07,609
- We're gonna need some cash.

611
00:30:07,610 --> 00:30:09,639
- Patty will take care of that.

612
00:30:09,640 --> 00:30:11,059
Now the reality is

613
00:30:11,060 --> 00:30:13,709
that we'll be under more
pressure than ever before.

614
00:30:13,710 --> 00:30:16,539
So, we need to take measures, Jaan.

615
00:30:16,540 --> 00:30:18,469
- Running a storage
garage up in Binghamton

616
00:30:18,470 --> 00:30:20,329
under the name of Salvatore Bella.

617
00:30:20,330 --> 00:30:22,259
That's the idea I'm using now.

618
00:30:22,260 --> 00:30:23,469
I've rented a five ton.

619
00:30:23,470 --> 00:30:25,029
I'll take Ray.

620
00:30:25,030 --> 00:30:26,209
I'll drop off his gear,

621
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:29,402
then Patty and the kids will
go straight on to Albany.

622
00:30:29,403 --> 00:30:30,619
- What about you guys?

623
00:30:30,620 --> 00:30:31,949
- Well, Barbara and the
kids can take our truck.

624
00:30:31,950 --> 00:30:33,809
We'll meet up after Binghamton.

625
00:30:33,810 --> 00:30:36,199
- Now unfortunately, the
Eastberry IDs burned.

626
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:38,719
That means all our IDs
are compromised, Patty.

627
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,149
- Get rid of anything that
has your old names on it.

628
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,236
- [Ray] Gregory.

629
00:30:42,237 --> 00:30:43,939
- I lined our route with a colored marker,

630
00:30:43,940 --> 00:30:46,519
like one of those AAA TripTiks.

631
00:30:46,520 --> 00:30:48,329
Head west out of Pennsylvania,

632
00:30:48,330 --> 00:30:50,169
then zigzag north through Ohio,

633
00:30:50,170 --> 00:30:51,759
and come into Binghamton by the back door.

634
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,229
- Great, okay, Tom and Carol,

635
00:30:54,230 --> 00:30:56,069
this relocating is gonna cost some money.

636
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,919
See to it that we have
a bank plan in the works

637
00:30:57,920 --> 00:30:59,209
by the end of the week.

638
00:30:59,210 --> 00:31:00,560
We'll need to hit one soon.

639
00:31:02,541 --> 00:31:03,541
- All right.

640
00:31:04,470 --> 00:31:06,345
- All right, let's go, load it up!

641
00:31:06,346 --> 00:31:07,179
- Yeah, yeah.

642
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,012
- Okay, sweetie, down.

643
00:31:11,358 --> 00:31:14,275
(melancholy music)

644
00:31:44,020 --> 00:31:45,179
- You don't look so hot.

645
00:31:45,180 --> 00:31:46,352
- Yeah, you either.

646
00:31:46,353 --> 00:31:48,779
- I spent the night over at the Lamonacos.

647
00:31:48,780 --> 00:31:49,780
- How's Donna?

648
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:53,483
- The way I would be is
she were consoling me.

649
00:31:56,120 --> 00:31:57,120
- Where's Gary?

650
00:32:00,890 --> 00:32:03,319
- Sent him over to the Haigans last night.

651
00:32:03,320 --> 00:32:04,839
- That's good.

652
00:32:04,840 --> 00:32:06,159
- Any leads?

653
00:32:06,160 --> 00:32:08,999
- Sort of, turns out that
the guys that murdered Phil

654
00:32:09,000 --> 00:32:11,289
are on the FBI's most wanted list,

655
00:32:11,290 --> 00:32:14,329
some left wing political terrorist group.

656
00:32:14,330 --> 00:32:15,529
- You think Phil knew that?

657
00:32:15,530 --> 00:32:16,693
- I doubt it.

658
00:32:17,932 --> 00:32:20,012
I think he just knew they were bad.

659
00:32:20,013 --> 00:32:22,930
(melancholy music)

660
00:32:29,744 --> 00:32:32,827
(car engine humming)

661
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:39,320
Hey.

662
00:32:41,730 --> 00:32:43,964
- One official Pennsylvania
search warrant.

663
00:32:43,965 --> 00:32:45,209
Are you gonna tell me why I
had to fly down here to get it?

664
00:32:45,210 --> 00:32:47,619
- The owner of this place
couldn't reach his tenant,

665
00:32:47,620 --> 00:32:49,749
so he came by in person
to check up on him.

666
00:32:49,750 --> 00:32:51,749
They're all gone, all except the dog,

667
00:32:51,750 --> 00:32:53,519
all alone and whining like crazy.

668
00:32:53,520 --> 00:32:54,819
The thing trashed the joint.

669
00:32:54,820 --> 00:32:55,929
The landlord went nuts.

670
00:32:55,930 --> 00:32:57,039
He called the Penn troopers.

671
00:32:57,040 --> 00:32:58,689
The Penn troopers called us.

672
00:32:58,690 --> 00:33:02,394
Seems that the house was
rented in the name of Easterly.

673
00:33:02,395 --> 00:33:05,789
Easterly, Eastberry, pretty close, right?

674
00:33:05,790 --> 00:33:06,790
- Let's go find out.

675
00:33:07,795 --> 00:33:09,709
(birds squawking)

676
00:33:09,710 --> 00:33:10,809
- Nice sound, huh?

677
00:33:10,810 --> 00:33:13,819
- Warning system, the Roman's used geese.

678
00:33:13,820 --> 00:33:15,594
- How'd you know that?

679
00:33:15,595 --> 00:33:16,813
- Read it in a book somewhere.

680
00:33:17,660 --> 00:33:19,933
- Classical terrorists, nice touch.

681
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:24,099
- [Officer] Take it on outside.

682
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:27,006
- Definitely a hasty exit, leave the dog.

683
00:33:27,007 --> 00:33:28,249
Dog leaves his business.

684
00:33:28,250 --> 00:33:30,000
Place starts to smell like a sewer.

685
00:33:34,740 --> 00:33:35,849
- [Mike] It's a kid's room.

686
00:33:35,850 --> 00:33:37,649
- [Jimmy] Yeah, just
the usual kid's stuff,

687
00:33:37,650 --> 00:33:40,963
photos of rock groups, toys, drawings.

688
00:33:44,810 --> 00:33:46,859
- The kids went to school?

689
00:33:46,860 --> 00:33:48,110
- Look what they studied.

690
00:33:54,345 --> 00:33:58,044
- Ah, here's a ah, bag up
the stuff a little faster.

691
00:33:58,045 --> 00:33:59,464
- I wonder who the kid is?

692
00:33:59,465 --> 00:34:00,298
- That's the kid who lives here.

693
00:34:00,298 --> 00:34:01,131
- [Officer] Mike, take
a look in these drawers.

694
00:34:01,132 --> 00:34:02,469
- With the guy who lives here.

695
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:04,053
- It could be two people
who don't have nothing to do

696
00:34:04,054 --> 00:34:05,604
with anything who knows, right?

697
00:34:10,850 --> 00:34:12,109
Jimmy.

698
00:34:12,110 --> 00:34:14,123
- Well, well, little black book.

699
00:34:15,684 --> 00:34:17,777
- [Officer] Checking the cellar right now.

700
00:34:20,017 --> 00:34:23,159
- Yeah, first names only, no area codes.

701
00:34:23,160 --> 00:34:24,269
These are our guys.

702
00:34:24,270 --> 00:34:25,770
Let's go, Jimmy.

703
00:34:25,771 --> 00:34:27,122
- I'm surprised the FBI's not here.

704
00:34:27,123 --> 00:34:28,948
- I'm not, I never called them.

705
00:34:28,949 --> 00:34:29,790
- You're kidding me?

706
00:34:29,790 --> 00:34:30,623
- No.

707
00:34:30,624 --> 00:34:32,669
- You know we're talking
borderline obstruction here, Mike?

708
00:34:32,670 --> 00:34:34,119
- The obstruction is
them getting here first,

709
00:34:34,120 --> 00:34:35,080
sealing the premises,

710
00:34:35,081 --> 00:34:37,795
and not letting us within an
inch of our own investigation.

711
00:34:37,796 --> 00:34:38,650
That's obstruction.

712
00:34:38,651 --> 00:34:39,829
If we're gonna find Phil's killer,

713
00:34:39,830 --> 00:34:41,480
we're gotta find him on our own.

714
00:34:51,901 --> 00:34:56,204
- [Officer] Four sets of
tire tracks right here!

715
00:34:56,205 --> 00:34:57,339
- You're out of your jurisdiction!

716
00:34:57,340 --> 00:34:58,799
This is an illegal search!

717
00:34:58,800 --> 00:35:01,029
- Oh yeah, I'm sure the Pennsylvania judge

718
00:35:01,030 --> 00:35:02,039
who issued this would disagree.

719
00:35:02,040 --> 00:35:03,809
- Hey, I thought I made it clear

720
00:35:03,810 --> 00:35:05,469
that this is our investigation!

721
00:35:05,470 --> 00:35:07,739
- Yeah, and our deceased victim.

722
00:35:07,740 --> 00:35:11,393
- Garret, I'm gonna say
this one last time, okay?

723
00:35:12,440 --> 00:35:14,719
I appreciate your loss, I do,

724
00:35:14,720 --> 00:35:16,519
and you're entitled to investigate

725
00:35:16,520 --> 00:35:17,819
the murder of Trooper Lamonaco,

726
00:35:17,820 --> 00:35:19,079
but in the process,

727
00:35:19,080 --> 00:35:23,779
you will not, you can not
impede an FBI investigation

728
00:35:23,780 --> 00:35:26,849
of a terrorist group that
is a threat to dozens,

729
00:35:26,850 --> 00:35:29,069
if not hundreds of other people!

730
00:35:29,070 --> 00:35:31,099
Now you wanna work on this, fine,

731
00:35:31,100 --> 00:35:32,939
but you pull something like this again,

732
00:35:32,940 --> 00:35:34,229
and I promise you,

733
00:35:34,230 --> 00:35:36,529
I will have you yanked off your own case!

734
00:35:36,530 --> 00:35:38,459
Now, are we clear on this?

735
00:35:38,460 --> 00:35:39,679
- I hear ya.

736
00:35:39,680 --> 00:35:41,259
- Good, and another thing,

737
00:35:41,260 --> 00:35:43,923
you uncover anything, you tell me.

738
00:35:48,984 --> 00:35:52,516
- [Officer] Get large garbage bags!

739
00:35:52,517 --> 00:35:53,559
- You don't think he
was referring to things

740
00:35:53,560 --> 00:35:56,010
like this ah, photo or
phone book, do you, Jimmy?

741
00:35:57,370 --> 00:36:00,689
- He was a good kid, well mannered.

742
00:36:00,690 --> 00:36:02,159
He just sort of blended in.

743
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,559
I'm sorry I can't tell you more.

744
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:06,089
- Do you have a picture of him?

745
00:36:06,090 --> 00:36:09,869
- No, he was absent the
day we took class pictures.

746
00:36:09,870 --> 00:36:11,329
I was real clear with the parents.

747
00:36:11,330 --> 00:36:14,269
We only had one day to do it,
but unfortunately he was sick.

748
00:36:14,270 --> 00:36:15,270
- Mm hmm.

749
00:36:16,760 --> 00:36:17,760
Would this be him?

750
00:36:19,590 --> 00:36:21,369
- That's Timmy Eastberry, yes.

751
00:36:21,370 --> 00:36:23,149
Or, what'd you say his name was?

752
00:36:23,150 --> 00:36:25,259
- Manning, Jamie Manning?

753
00:36:25,260 --> 00:36:27,360
Do you ah, recognize the man in the photo?

754
00:36:28,290 --> 00:36:30,609
- No I don't, but it's not his father.

755
00:36:30,610 --> 00:36:31,602
I can tell you that.

756
00:36:31,602 --> 00:36:32,435
- [Mike] Mm hmm.

757
00:36:32,436 --> 00:36:34,083
- Or at least the man I thought was.

758
00:36:34,970 --> 00:36:36,483
This is very confusing.

759
00:36:37,707 --> 00:36:41,023
- If you should think of anything
else, call us, thank you.

760
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:55,549
- This is your copy, sir.

761
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:56,550
- Thank you.

762
00:37:04,829 --> 00:37:06,559
Rent's due first of the month.

763
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:07,393
Lock is ours.

764
00:37:07,394 --> 00:37:08,489
We have the only key.

765
00:37:08,490 --> 00:37:09,707
- Good job, let's go.

766
00:37:11,223 --> 00:37:12,559
- [Officer] We don't have anything yet!

767
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:15,282
(birds squawking)

768
00:37:15,283 --> 00:37:17,909
- Does everybody in this
group study ancient Rome?

769
00:37:17,910 --> 00:37:19,996
- It's cheaper than the
alarm system at my house.

770
00:37:19,997 --> 00:37:21,899
(Mike chuckles)

771
00:37:21,900 --> 00:37:24,059
- Hey, anything you'd like to share

772
00:37:24,060 --> 00:37:25,389
since we let you go first?

773
00:37:25,390 --> 00:37:28,239
- Landlord said they were
good tenants, quiet, clean,

774
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:30,469
paid their rent on time, three kids.

775
00:37:30,470 --> 00:37:32,559
- Just your average hardworking
American family, right?

776
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:33,859
- Yeah, they stripped the place clean,

777
00:37:33,860 --> 00:37:36,179
took everything, even
the landlord's stove.

778
00:37:36,180 --> 00:37:37,689
- Any info says they own trucks?

779
00:37:37,690 --> 00:37:39,009
- Nope.

780
00:37:39,010 --> 00:37:40,819
- Guess that means they had to rent one.

781
00:37:40,820 --> 00:37:43,109
- Yeah, Garret, they had to rent one.

782
00:37:43,110 --> 00:37:45,049
Which means we already
had to check the records

783
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:46,869
of every truck rental place in the area

784
00:37:46,870 --> 00:37:48,159
covering the last week.

785
00:37:48,160 --> 00:37:49,209
So you're a little late,

786
00:37:49,210 --> 00:37:51,429
but I'll be sure to ah,
drop the Major a line

787
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:53,593
about your incredible insights.

788
00:37:57,500 --> 00:37:58,500
- Thank you.

789
00:37:59,772 --> 00:38:01,719
Mm, guy's got a big head, huh?

790
00:38:01,720 --> 00:38:02,720
- [Jimmy] Huge.

791
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:06,130
(crows cawing)

792
00:38:09,122 --> 00:38:12,205
(bus engine humming)

793
00:38:20,739 --> 00:38:23,739
- Hey, Jamie, how was the first day?

794
00:38:25,260 --> 00:38:28,832
Jamie, what's wrong, Jamie?

795
00:38:28,833 --> 00:38:31,889
(melancholy music)

796
00:38:31,890 --> 00:38:33,950
Jamie, what's wrong, honey, huh?

797
00:38:36,462 --> 00:38:39,229
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hold up!

798
00:38:39,230 --> 00:38:40,529
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

799
00:38:40,530 --> 00:38:42,713
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, what is it?

800
00:38:43,790 --> 00:38:45,321
What's wrong, did somebody...

801
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:47,459
- They think I'm stupid.

802
00:38:47,460 --> 00:38:48,619
- Who does?

803
00:38:48,620 --> 00:38:49,620
- It's my fault.

804
00:38:50,310 --> 00:38:51,769
- What is, what's your fault?

805
00:38:51,770 --> 00:38:55,019
- A teacher asked me to
write my name on the board,

806
00:38:55,020 --> 00:38:57,869
and I started to, then,

807
00:38:57,870 --> 00:39:01,226
then I couldn't remember what
name I was supposed to be.

808
00:39:01,227 --> 00:39:02,227
- Oh, honey.

809
00:39:04,307 --> 00:39:06,209
- So I just stood there like some jerk

810
00:39:06,210 --> 00:39:07,823
who couldn't spell his name,

811
00:39:09,037 --> 00:39:10,963
and the kids started laughing at me.

812
00:39:12,777 --> 00:39:15,129
I don't know why I couldn't remember it.

813
00:39:15,130 --> 00:39:16,668
I got mixed up I guess.

814
00:39:16,669 --> 00:39:17,725
I'm sorry, Mom, I'm sorry.

815
00:39:17,726 --> 00:39:21,912
- No, you've got nothing
to be sorry about, nothing.

816
00:39:21,913 --> 00:39:22,913
I'm sorry.

817
00:39:24,150 --> 00:39:25,223
Love you Jamie.

818
00:39:26,620 --> 00:39:28,713
- It's Michael, Michael Conway.

819
00:39:30,216 --> 00:39:32,394
- Oh, I love you, Jamie.

820
00:39:32,395 --> 00:39:35,312
(melancholy music)

821
00:39:40,487 --> 00:39:42,083
I'm sorry, I just,

822
00:39:44,030 --> 00:39:47,043
seems like the old philosophy's
fallen by the wayside.

823
00:39:49,030 --> 00:39:50,883
We're bank robbers, period.

824
00:39:53,250 --> 00:39:55,739
- Are you saying it's time
to plant another bomb?

825
00:39:55,740 --> 00:39:58,539
- No, I'm saying we used
to stand for something,

826
00:39:58,540 --> 00:39:59,723
or say we did.

827
00:40:02,040 --> 00:40:06,669
Going out to fight the good
fight against oppression.

828
00:40:06,670 --> 00:40:07,540
Well, I don't see us helping

829
00:40:07,541 --> 00:40:11,363
any oppressed people
lately except ourselves.

830
00:40:13,247 --> 00:40:17,634
♪ Yet you never put me on the spot ♪

831
00:40:17,635 --> 00:40:19,539
We're nothing but a bunch
of common criminals.

832
00:40:19,540 --> 00:40:20,490
- Come on, Carol.

833
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:21,490
- No, no, Tom.

834
00:40:22,518 --> 00:40:23,718
I think she has a point.

835
00:40:25,090 --> 00:40:29,183
We do seem to have lost our
focus lately, our vision.

836
00:40:35,040 --> 00:40:36,243
Say we do another bank.

837
00:40:37,570 --> 00:40:39,956
We build ourselves a strong
financial position again,

838
00:40:39,957 --> 00:40:41,823
and we get back to our true purpose.

839
00:40:43,220 --> 00:40:44,489
We draw attention again

840
00:40:44,490 --> 00:40:47,109
to the purveyors of
oppression and suffering

841
00:40:47,110 --> 00:40:49,693
by destroying their ill gotten rewards.

842
00:40:51,888 --> 00:40:54,113
We dig in deeper than we ever have.

843
00:40:59,248 --> 00:41:01,831
And thank you for the reminder.

847
00:41:16,949 --> 00:41:18,957
- [Officer] I'm going
down to the evidence room!

848
00:41:18,958 --> 00:41:22,249
(officers chattering)
(telephones ringing)

849
00:41:22,250 --> 00:41:25,383
- Whoa, Jimmy, look at this.

850
00:41:26,900 --> 00:41:29,349
Same phone number in
Boston called repeatedly.

851
00:41:29,350 --> 00:41:31,129
Matches up with the one in a book.

852
00:41:31,130 --> 00:41:32,619
How about we find out who it belongs to?

853
00:41:32,620 --> 00:41:33,709
Take a ride up there?

854
00:41:33,710 --> 00:41:34,550
- Boston?

855
00:41:34,550 --> 00:41:35,510
- I'll drive.

856
00:41:35,511 --> 00:41:37,269
- Mike, that's a six hour haul.

857
00:41:37,270 --> 00:41:38,870
- So ah, we'll be there by four.

858
00:41:39,903 --> 00:41:42,653
(train rumbling)

859
00:41:47,243 --> 00:41:48,419
- Wow, drove 300 miles for this?

860
00:41:48,420 --> 00:41:50,043
- Looks like your kind of place.

861
00:41:53,242 --> 00:41:54,075
How you doing?

862
00:41:54,076 --> 00:41:55,589
- Well, can I help you, gentlemen?

863
00:41:55,590 --> 00:41:56,590
- Yeah.

864
00:41:57,510 --> 00:41:58,510
- Oh.

865
00:42:02,367 --> 00:42:04,273
Oh, what's young Dickie done now?

866
00:42:06,731 --> 00:42:07,564
- You know this guy?

867
00:42:07,565 --> 00:42:08,919
- Dickie Williams, yeah.

868
00:42:08,920 --> 00:42:11,849
He always managed to get in
trouble one way or another.

869
00:42:11,850 --> 00:42:13,929
Actually stole a car on the way to court

870
00:42:13,930 --> 00:42:15,480
for an auto theft rap (laughs).

871
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:19,490
He just never had much
respect for the law.

872
00:42:19,491 --> 00:42:23,660
I had to bounce him out of
this place, crying shame.

873
00:42:23,661 --> 00:42:25,493
- Yeah, and you don't know the half of it.

874
00:42:25,494 --> 00:42:26,873
- [Bartender] Well.

875
00:42:26,874 --> 00:42:27,874
- Yeah.

876
00:42:30,472 --> 00:42:31,636
(both laughing)

877
00:42:31,637 --> 00:42:34,119
- Hey look, maybe I, I should wait outside

878
00:42:34,120 --> 00:42:35,469
while you pay your respects.

879
00:42:35,470 --> 00:42:36,303
- You afraid of the FBI?

880
00:42:36,304 --> 00:42:38,659
- Nah, just don't wanna
get blood on my suit

881
00:42:38,660 --> 00:42:40,052
when he slams your head against the wall.

882
00:42:40,053 --> 00:42:42,803
- What, me and Val are like this.

883
00:42:43,777 --> 00:42:46,562
- Let me know if we hear back
from the property manager.

884
00:42:46,563 --> 00:42:49,480
(knocking on door)

885
00:42:50,550 --> 00:42:52,049
Well, let me guess.

886
00:42:52,050 --> 00:42:54,639
You wanted to see a Sox game at Fenway.

887
00:42:54,640 --> 00:42:55,840
- I heard you had a box.

888
00:42:56,890 --> 00:42:59,149
- [Gabriel] Long way from home, aren't ya?

889
00:42:59,150 --> 00:43:00,889
- You gonna invite us in or what?

890
00:43:00,890 --> 00:43:02,003
- Well, that depends.

891
00:43:02,970 --> 00:43:04,149
- I need you to run a set of prints

892
00:43:04,150 --> 00:43:05,700
on a guy named Dickie Williams.

893
00:43:06,850 --> 00:43:09,373
Five will get you 10 he's the key.

894
00:43:11,310 --> 00:43:12,310
- How'd you ID him?

895
00:43:13,759 --> 00:43:15,339
- He used to hang out at a pub,

896
00:43:15,340 --> 00:43:18,729
practically lived in it, near
here, in fact, real near.

897
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:19,769
Ah, what do you call it?

898
00:43:19,770 --> 00:43:22,749
It's about five or 10 minutes
from ah, what's it, Jimmy?

899
00:43:22,750 --> 00:43:23,809
- Office of Origin.

900
00:43:23,810 --> 00:43:25,249
- Yeah.

901
00:43:25,250 --> 00:43:26,750
- Where'd you get the picture?

902
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:30,483
- What's the difference
if he's one of our guys?

903
00:43:32,180 --> 00:43:34,319
- Where'd you get the picture?

904
00:43:34,320 --> 00:43:35,320
- Pennsylvania.

905
00:43:36,910 --> 00:43:39,689
- Now, we had to talk
about this, didn't we?

906
00:43:39,690 --> 00:43:40,550
- What?

907
00:43:40,551 --> 00:43:45,219
- The Manning house was
a federal crime scene.

908
00:43:45,220 --> 00:43:48,719
This photograph is evidence
and you withheld it?

909
00:43:48,720 --> 00:43:50,749
- I sent full reports
on every move we made,

910
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:52,609
which I'm sure you never bothered to read.

911
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:53,689
My ass is covered.

912
00:43:53,690 --> 00:43:57,369
- Your ass is gonna end up
in a federal penitentiary!

913
00:43:57,370 --> 00:44:00,909
This arrogance and this
renegade cop on a mission crap

914
00:44:00,910 --> 00:44:02,709
does not fly with me!

915
00:44:02,710 --> 00:44:05,589
- That's because you see
Phil's death in only one way,

916
00:44:05,590 --> 00:44:07,490
the break you need to crack your case.

917
00:44:08,590 --> 00:44:10,149
You know what, you're right.

918
00:44:10,150 --> 00:44:12,649
With pressure you're
gonna make more mistakes.

919
00:44:12,650 --> 00:44:14,979
And now I'm gonna give you a bonus break.

920
00:44:14,980 --> 00:44:16,043
I'm helping you out.

921
00:44:17,091 --> 00:44:20,529
- (scoffs) Get outta my office.

922
00:44:20,530 --> 00:44:21,530
Get out!

923
00:44:24,960 --> 00:44:26,710
- Don't forget to run those prints.

924
00:44:27,610 --> 00:44:29,943
(cup thuds)

925
00:44:33,120 --> 00:44:35,229
Agent Valentino overreacted, sir.

926
00:44:35,230 --> 00:44:37,629
Jimmy and I found a valuable
lead to Phil's murder.

927
00:44:37,630 --> 00:44:38,889
All we did was follow it up.

928
00:44:38,890 --> 00:44:40,039
- Uh huh, and then all you did

929
00:44:40,040 --> 00:44:41,929
was shove it in Valentino's face,

930
00:44:41,930 --> 00:44:44,719
and imply he was an incompetent
moron in front of his men,

931
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:47,809
after admitting you pocketed
a crucial piece of evidence.

932
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:50,919
In my book that's
questionable behavior at best.

933
00:44:50,920 --> 00:44:53,019
If anybody overreacted here, it's you.

934
00:44:53,020 --> 00:44:53,853
- This Valentino...

935
00:44:53,854 --> 00:44:56,879
- This Valentino is the man in charge!

936
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:59,199
Mike, I know what Phil meant to you.

937
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,599
All the same, you gotta
leave your emotions at home.

938
00:45:01,600 --> 00:45:03,569
When the badge is on you
act like a professional.

939
00:45:03,570 --> 00:45:04,719
And if you're in the jurisdiction

940
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,049
of another law enforcement agency,

941
00:45:06,050 --> 00:45:07,450
you treat them with respect.

942
00:45:08,490 --> 00:45:11,373
If you can't, I would understand,

943
00:45:12,890 --> 00:45:14,393
but then you're off the case.

944
00:45:15,800 --> 00:45:16,800
Up to you.

945
00:45:23,746 --> 00:45:25,199
- [Woman] Judd, did he call you back yet?

946
00:45:25,200 --> 00:45:26,646
- [Judd] Yeah, he's down
at the booking office.

947
00:45:26,647 --> 00:45:28,647
- O'Doul, just a minute.

948
00:45:29,922 --> 00:45:31,121
It's Val.

949
00:45:31,122 --> 00:45:32,161
- For me?

950
00:45:32,162 --> 00:45:33,162
- Line two.

951
00:45:35,953 --> 00:45:37,817
- I can't believe you called my CO.

952
00:45:37,818 --> 00:45:39,369
- Well, I can't believe you stole

953
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:41,823
vital information from our investigation.

954
00:45:42,950 --> 00:45:43,850
- What do you want?

955
00:45:43,850 --> 00:45:44,700
- I ran the prints.

956
00:45:44,701 --> 00:45:46,549
Richard Dickie Williams did five years

957
00:45:46,550 --> 00:45:50,069
for robbing a motel with a
broken gun and guess what?

958
00:45:50,070 --> 00:45:52,223
His prints match the prints in the Nova.

959
00:45:53,070 --> 00:45:54,099
He was in the car.

960
00:45:54,100 --> 00:45:55,229
He's probably the shooter.

961
00:45:55,230 --> 00:45:56,230
I gotta go.

962
00:46:02,900 --> 00:46:03,900
- All right.

963
00:46:09,160 --> 00:46:11,323
- [Gregory] You sure you
told her the right place?

964
00:46:12,360 --> 00:46:13,659
- Yeah, I'm sure, Greg.

965
00:46:13,660 --> 00:46:15,769
What the hell do you want from me, man?

966
00:46:15,770 --> 00:46:17,629
Got an old lady who can't tell time.

967
00:46:17,630 --> 00:46:19,309
How simple could it be man, huh?

968
00:46:19,310 --> 00:46:20,579
How simple could it be?

969
00:46:20,580 --> 00:46:23,399
- Easy, man, she's got a
truckload of furniture.

970
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:24,270
She's got two kids.

971
00:46:24,271 --> 00:46:25,419
- She's half an hour late,

972
00:46:25,420 --> 00:46:26,999
and here we are sitting here

973
00:46:27,000 --> 00:46:27,833
in the middle of the night,

974
00:46:27,834 --> 00:46:29,291
in the middle of nowhere.

975
00:46:29,292 --> 00:46:32,292
(crickets chirping)

976
00:46:34,121 --> 00:46:36,599
(engine humming)

977
00:46:36,600 --> 00:46:38,039
Wait a minute.

978
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:39,040
It's gotta be them.

979
00:46:41,782 --> 00:46:44,782
(suspenseful music)

980
00:46:47,142 --> 00:46:48,281
what're you doing?

981
00:46:48,282 --> 00:46:49,701
Put it away.

982
00:46:49,702 --> 00:46:50,535
- These guys are all hooked into

983
00:46:50,536 --> 00:46:51,949
the same computer system, Jaan.

984
00:46:51,950 --> 00:46:53,939
They figure out who we are
and it's all over for us,

985
00:46:53,940 --> 00:46:56,042
and I'm not gonna let that happen.

986
00:46:56,043 --> 00:46:58,543
If they'll leave us alone
and I'll be cool, relax.

987
00:47:00,450 --> 00:47:01,450
- I'm relaxed, man.

988
00:47:04,800 --> 00:47:06,506
Just trying to get a little rest, Officer.

989
00:47:06,507 --> 00:47:08,659
- Can I see your license
and registration, please?

990
00:47:08,660 --> 00:47:10,269
- Sure.

991
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:12,510
- Would you gentlemen like to
step outta the car, please?

992
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:14,140
- [Jaan] Okay.

993
00:47:15,039 --> 00:47:18,039
(suspenseful music)

994
00:47:19,858 --> 00:47:20,691
- Mine's got body armor!

995
00:47:20,692 --> 00:47:23,839
(door thuds)
(officer grunts)

996
00:47:23,840 --> 00:47:24,673
He's got a gun!

997
00:47:24,674 --> 00:47:27,090
(gun firing)

998
00:47:30,810 --> 00:47:31,870
Help me!

999
00:47:31,871 --> 00:47:34,414
(men grunting)

1000
00:47:34,415 --> 00:47:37,998
Get down in the dirt,
down in the dirt now!

1001
00:47:39,098 --> 00:47:41,848
(sirens wailing)

1002
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:46,920
- Talk to me.

1003
00:47:47,884 --> 00:47:49,269
- They're bringing him out.

1004
00:47:49,270 --> 00:47:50,820
Box full of these in the trunk.

1005
00:47:56,710 --> 00:47:59,009
He's as tightlipped as a prisoner of war.

1006
00:47:59,010 --> 00:48:00,469
All he says is that he
was hitching a ride,

1007
00:48:00,470 --> 00:48:02,969
and he has no idea who the driver was.

1008
00:48:02,970 --> 00:48:03,970
- Really?

1009
00:48:06,730 --> 00:48:08,505
Well, I think he just may be lying.

1010
00:48:08,506 --> 00:48:09,339
(Walter chuckles)

1011
00:48:09,340 --> 00:48:11,800
Find out when we get to Boston.

1012
00:48:14,046 --> 00:48:16,796
(birds chirping)

1013
00:48:32,423 --> 00:48:33,423
- Hey, hey, man.

1014
00:48:34,910 --> 00:48:35,750
- Any word on Gregory?

1015
00:48:35,751 --> 00:48:37,099
- Well, they took him to Boston.

1016
00:48:37,100 --> 00:48:38,679
That's all I know.

1017
00:48:38,680 --> 00:48:39,513
Jaan made it.

1018
00:48:39,513 --> 00:48:40,346
- Yeah?

1019
00:48:40,347 --> 00:48:41,432
- He's coming down with Barb and the kids.

1020
00:48:41,433 --> 00:48:44,909
I had to get 'em hooked up
outside Berkshire County.

1021
00:48:44,910 --> 00:48:46,223
- If Barbara knew how to tell time,

1022
00:48:46,224 --> 00:48:47,709
none of this would be happening.

1023
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:49,139
- Hey, Dickie, remember the one about

1024
00:48:49,140 --> 00:48:51,559
glass houses and stones?

1025
00:48:51,560 --> 00:48:53,937
- Yeah, Carol, I do remember, do you?

1026
00:48:55,314 --> 00:48:56,709
- What the hell is that supposed to mean?

1027
00:48:56,710 --> 00:48:58,929
- Means I'm sick of this attitude.

1028
00:48:58,930 --> 00:49:00,399
You ain't better than us.

1029
00:49:00,400 --> 00:49:01,459
You were right there in Boston

1030
00:49:01,460 --> 00:49:03,779
when that bomb blew that
security guard's leg off.

1031
00:49:03,780 --> 00:49:06,782
- Hey, that was six years ago.

1032
00:49:06,783 --> 00:49:08,649
- (laughs) Yeah, what'd he grow

1033
00:49:08,650 --> 00:49:10,509
a new leg back since then, huh?

1034
00:49:10,510 --> 00:49:11,633
I don't think so.

1035
00:49:12,920 --> 00:49:15,870
You, Tommy boy, you got blood
on your hands too (chuckles).

1036
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:19,746
(telephone ringing)

1037
00:49:25,970 --> 00:49:28,513
- Hey, Pat, how you doing?

1038
00:49:31,968 --> 00:49:32,968
- Yeah?

1039
00:49:39,149 --> 00:49:40,469
Everybody listen up.

1040
00:49:40,470 --> 00:49:42,143
Five minutes, they're coming in.

1041
00:49:43,338 --> 00:49:46,515
(suspenseful music)

1042
00:49:46,516 --> 00:49:48,515
- Come on, kids, we're
gonna go downstairs.

1043
00:49:48,516 --> 00:49:49,996
Come on, quick, quick, quick, quick!

1044
00:49:49,997 --> 00:49:53,962
Sweetie pie, we have
to go downstairs, ooh!

1045
00:49:53,963 --> 00:49:56,762
(girl and Patty giggle)

1046
00:49:56,763 --> 00:49:59,763
(suspenseful music)

1047
00:50:51,681 --> 00:50:53,336
- [Dickie] They're here, they're okay!

1048
00:50:53,337 --> 00:50:54,416
- [Patty] They made it!

1049
00:50:54,417 --> 00:50:55,610
- It's all right!

1050
00:50:55,611 --> 00:50:56,694
- [Boy] Jaan!

1051
00:50:58,231 --> 00:50:59,566
(women laughing)

1052
00:50:59,567 --> 00:51:00,663
(dog barking)

1053
00:51:00,664 --> 00:51:02,126
- [Ray] We'll unload the truck quick!

1054
00:51:02,127 --> 00:51:04,030
- [Dickie] Yeah, all right, yeah!

1055
00:51:04,031 --> 00:51:09,031
(melancholy music)
(families chattering)

1056
00:51:12,770 --> 00:51:14,252
- That's everyone, right?

1057
00:51:14,253 --> 00:51:17,170
(melancholy music)

1058
00:51:18,813 --> 00:51:20,546
- [Patty] Come on, you hungry?

1059
00:51:20,547 --> 00:51:23,464
(melancholy music)

1060
00:51:25,757 --> 00:51:26,590
- I'm gonna crack this, Jenny.

1061
00:51:26,591 --> 00:51:27,839
I can feel it.

1062
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:30,099
This guy they caught
could be the linchpin,

1063
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:32,349
and I got some ideas on this myself.

1064
00:51:32,350 --> 00:51:34,029
- Think you might be
jumping the gun here a bit,

1065
00:51:34,030 --> 00:51:36,126
just running up to Boston like this?

1066
00:51:36,127 --> 00:51:37,010
- Nah, it's what I've been waiting for.

1067
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:38,010
This is what I need.

1068
00:51:39,847 --> 00:51:41,989
No more sitting here in
Jersey chasing our tails,

1069
00:51:41,990 --> 00:51:44,576
while the, while the
action's up in Boston.

1070
00:51:44,577 --> 00:51:46,109
I mean, I can't stand waiting.

1071
00:51:46,110 --> 00:51:47,139
I want these guys.

1072
00:51:47,140 --> 00:51:50,050
- I know, I just, be careful.

1073
00:51:51,529 --> 00:51:52,529
- All right.

1074
00:51:53,550 --> 00:51:55,802
I'll call you as soon as I get to Boston.

1075
00:51:55,803 --> 00:51:57,729
The hotel's right down the
block from the FBI headquarters.

1076
00:51:57,730 --> 00:51:59,679
I'll be right in Valentino's lap.

1077
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:00,979
- That's the problem, Mike.

1078
00:52:00,980 --> 00:52:02,609
He doesn't want you there.

1079
00:52:02,610 --> 00:52:04,360
- We'll figure that part out later.

1080
00:52:07,210 --> 00:52:09,929
- [Gabriel] I still wanna know
about this Salvatore Bella.

1081
00:52:09,930 --> 00:52:11,077
- Never heard of him.

1082
00:52:12,060 --> 00:52:14,199
- [Gabriel] You were
riding in his front seat.

1083
00:52:14,200 --> 00:52:17,509
- I told them, I told you, I hitched.

1084
00:52:17,510 --> 00:52:19,119
- [Gabriel] Mm hmm, and
you always hitchhike

1085
00:52:19,120 --> 00:52:20,649
wearing body armor?

1086
00:52:20,650 --> 00:52:22,150
- It's a dangerous world, man.

1087
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:24,999
- Yeah, it is.

1088
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:26,699
It certainly is.

1089
00:52:26,700 --> 00:52:28,950
Especially with guys
like you running around.

1090
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,039
I mean you, you've done time
on a weapons conviction,

1091
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:35,399
and now you are involved

1092
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,133
in the attempted murder
of a police officer.

1093
00:52:40,250 --> 00:52:42,829
Sounds to me like the safest thing to do

1094
00:52:42,830 --> 00:52:43,770
would be to lock you up

1095
00:52:43,771 --> 00:52:47,429
until you talk to me
about Bella, or you die,

1096
00:52:47,430 --> 00:52:49,249
whichever comes first.

1097
00:52:49,250 --> 00:52:51,229
- I got nothing to say to you, man.

1098
00:52:51,230 --> 00:52:53,659
- Nothing, you don't wanna tell me

1099
00:52:53,660 --> 00:52:55,410
about your friend, Dickie Williams?

1100
00:52:56,410 --> 00:52:57,553
- I want a lawyer.

1101
00:52:59,206 --> 00:53:00,949
(fingers snap)

1102
00:53:00,950 --> 00:53:02,459
- That's a good idea.

1103
00:53:02,460 --> 00:53:06,609
In fact, you should think about
having two or three lawyers,

1104
00:53:06,610 --> 00:53:09,289
because I have been on to
you guys for a long time,

1105
00:53:09,290 --> 00:53:13,693
and Gregory, I must tell
you, this is personal.

1106
00:53:21,760 --> 00:53:22,593
Put him in his cell.

1107
00:53:22,593 --> 00:53:23,520
Get him outta here.

1108
00:53:23,520 --> 00:53:24,420
- Hey!

1109
00:53:24,420 --> 00:53:25,253
- What're you doing here?

1110
00:53:25,254 --> 00:53:27,503
- I thought the FBI never
took things personally?

1111
00:53:29,140 --> 00:53:31,059
- [Gabriel] Hey please,
it's been a long day.

1112
00:53:31,060 --> 00:53:32,076
- [Mike] You could use some fresh blood.

1113
00:53:32,077 --> 00:53:33,696
- [Gabriel] You don't
go anywhere near him.

1114
00:53:33,697 --> 00:53:35,439
- [Mike] I'm on the case, Valentino.

1115
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:36,273
I mean, come on.

1116
00:53:36,274 --> 00:53:37,396
You wouldn't have ID'd
Dickie Williams if I hadn't...

1117
00:53:37,397 --> 00:53:39,099
- [Gabriel] If you hadn't lifted evidence.

1118
00:53:39,100 --> 00:53:41,009
Yeah, right, thanks, very helpful!

1119
00:53:41,010 --> 00:53:43,039
- All right, all that aside,
you know I'm good at this.

1120
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:45,499
Come on, I mean, I could alter my style.

1121
00:53:45,500 --> 00:53:46,739
I drove all the way up here.

1122
00:53:46,740 --> 00:53:47,573
I got a brand new suit.

1123
00:53:47,574 --> 00:53:49,329
I got a beautiful room with a view.

1124
00:53:49,330 --> 00:53:51,089
Why not just let me on the starting team?

1125
00:53:51,090 --> 00:53:53,799
- Walter, Walter, I didn't
get anywhere with Davis.

1126
00:53:53,800 --> 00:53:54,962
What did you find?

1127
00:53:54,963 --> 00:53:57,963
(telephone ringing)

1128
00:53:58,870 --> 00:54:01,369
- Came up with a print match
for one Salvatore Bella,

1129
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:05,019
AKA Jaan Carl Laaman, 36, Buffalo,

1130
00:54:05,020 --> 00:54:06,369
did five years for robbery.

1131
00:54:06,370 --> 00:54:07,679
Then paroled to go to college,

1132
00:54:07,680 --> 00:54:10,029
where he helped start
the local SDS chapter,

1133
00:54:10,030 --> 00:54:13,129
and subsequently bombed a
New Hampshire police station.

1134
00:54:13,130 --> 00:54:14,679
- Yeah, education's a wonderful thing.

1135
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:17,239
Garret, do you remember
those truck rental receipts

1136
00:54:17,240 --> 00:54:18,979
we found back in Pennsylvania?

1137
00:54:18,980 --> 00:54:19,813
- What about them?

1138
00:54:19,814 --> 00:54:21,219
- They're downstairs in a basement room.

1139
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:22,809
I want you to go through
every one of them.

1140
00:54:22,810 --> 00:54:23,910
See what you can find.

1141
00:54:25,310 --> 00:54:26,329
- Hey, you know in my neighborhood,

1142
00:54:26,330 --> 00:54:27,730
they call that grunt work.

1143
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:31,029
- Well, you're not in your neighborhood.

1144
00:54:31,030 --> 00:54:32,789
Everybody involved in this investigation's

1145
00:54:32,790 --> 00:54:34,419
been doing grunt work from day one.

1146
00:54:34,420 --> 00:54:36,309
I've been doing it for seven years.

1147
00:54:36,310 --> 00:54:37,889
Now, I didn't ask you here.

1148
00:54:37,890 --> 00:54:40,163
You want in, you got an assignment.

1149
00:54:45,580 --> 00:54:48,689
- The Salvatore Bella ID is blown.

1150
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:49,919
- Then we better get to Binghamton,

1151
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:51,179
and get our stuff outta storage.

1152
00:54:51,180 --> 00:54:52,236
- No, it's too late.

1153
00:54:52,237 --> 00:54:54,269
The FBI's probably sitting
on that place already,

1154
00:54:54,270 --> 00:54:55,579
just waiting for us to show.

1155
00:54:55,580 --> 00:54:57,099
- Wait, there's disguises in there,

1156
00:54:57,100 --> 00:54:59,319
minutes of our meetings,
a bomb manual, cash.

1157
00:54:59,320 --> 00:55:00,619
They get ahold of that, they got us.

1158
00:55:00,620 --> 00:55:01,969
- [Jaan] No, can't be traced.

1159
00:55:01,970 --> 00:55:03,220
- He's right, we're okay.

1160
00:55:04,200 --> 00:55:05,300
Binghamton's a memory.

1161
00:55:07,120 --> 00:55:09,289
I want to talk about the bombings.

1162
00:55:09,290 --> 00:55:10,270
Our plan needs to be

1163
00:55:10,271 --> 00:55:12,773
even more precisely calculated than ever.

1164
00:55:13,650 --> 00:55:15,870
No civilian casualties.

1165
00:55:15,871 --> 00:55:20,479
(thunder rumbling)
(rain pattering)

1166
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:23,429
I've duplicated maps for
three possible targets,

1167
00:55:23,430 --> 00:55:25,293
New York, and New Hampshire.

1168
00:55:33,100 --> 00:55:36,169
- I don't think we need to
do another bombing, Ray.

1169
00:55:36,170 --> 00:55:37,209
We need to get some cash,

1170
00:55:37,210 --> 00:55:39,289
set up in our houses in Ohio, and lay low.

1171
00:55:39,290 --> 00:55:40,709
- I say we crank up the stakes.

1172
00:55:40,710 --> 00:55:42,149
The more bombings, the better.

1173
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:42,983
- You know what, Dickie?

1174
00:55:42,984 --> 00:55:44,879
You just like to see stuff blow up.

1175
00:55:44,880 --> 00:55:46,772
I'm telling you the timing's all wrong.

1176
00:55:46,773 --> 00:55:49,229
- Now, listen, I agree with you, Tom.

1177
00:55:49,230 --> 00:55:52,439
About the Ohio move, I
think that's a good idea,

1178
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,279
but the bombings have
to happen as planned.

1179
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:56,289
- Tom, they think they got us.

1180
00:55:56,290 --> 00:55:57,123
There's no better time to show 'em

1181
00:55:57,124 --> 00:55:59,253
that the people are still strong.

1182
00:56:00,420 --> 00:56:01,499
It's a classic tactic.

1183
00:56:01,500 --> 00:56:02,696
You know that.

1184
00:56:02,697 --> 00:56:07,697
(thunder rumbling)
(rain pattering)

1185
00:56:08,330 --> 00:56:09,819
- Fine.

1186
00:56:09,820 --> 00:56:10,820
- Good.

1187
00:56:11,980 --> 00:56:12,980
Carol?

1188
00:56:14,370 --> 00:56:16,322
- Power to the people.

1189
00:56:16,323 --> 00:56:17,869
- What can I tell you, Jimmy?

1190
00:56:17,870 --> 00:56:19,320
I'm not enjoying this either.

1191
00:56:20,180 --> 00:56:21,759
At least you're doing your work in Jersey.

1192
00:56:21,760 --> 00:56:22,660
- Hey, you're the one who wanted

1193
00:56:22,661 --> 00:56:23,799
to traipse up to Boston, Mike.

1194
00:56:23,800 --> 00:56:24,780
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1195
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:26,580
Don't start, all right?

1196
00:56:26,581 --> 00:56:28,000
I'll see you when you get here.

1197
00:56:28,001 --> 00:56:29,001
- Yep.

1198
00:56:32,581 --> 00:56:35,581
(suspenseful music)

1199
00:56:47,694 --> 00:56:48,527
- The guard's pretty old.

1200
00:56:48,528 --> 00:56:49,709
It shouldn't be a problem.

1201
00:56:49,710 --> 00:56:52,029
He's lefthanded, keeps
the gun strapped in tight.

1202
00:56:52,030 --> 00:56:53,459
One of the bank officers controls

1203
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:55,219
the buzzer to the vault area.

1204
00:56:55,220 --> 00:56:56,370
- All right, well done.

1205
00:56:57,820 --> 00:57:02,820
(chopstick thudding)
(Gabriel humming)

1206
00:57:08,989 --> 00:57:11,739
(birds chirping)

1207
00:57:13,578 --> 00:57:16,749
- I don't do it for the money.

1208
00:57:16,750 --> 00:57:17,899
Helps me to think.

1209
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:19,949
- Yeah, you play for real?

1210
00:57:19,950 --> 00:57:21,269
- Another life.

1211
00:57:21,270 --> 00:57:23,339
- I didn't know FBI guys had other lives.

1212
00:57:23,340 --> 00:57:25,540
- Well, that's because
you're narrow-minded.

1213
00:57:26,560 --> 00:57:28,409
So, what do you want from me, my lunch?

1214
00:57:28,410 --> 00:57:31,839
- No, I ah, heard you're sitting
on some instruction manual

1215
00:57:31,840 --> 00:57:33,889
from one of the Pennsylvania houses.

1216
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:34,899
I wanna see it.

1217
00:57:34,900 --> 00:57:37,323
- We just got a copy of
it back from Quantico.

1218
00:57:38,242 --> 00:57:39,075
It was in code.

1219
00:57:39,076 --> 00:57:41,529
We couldn't read it without
a cross reference, okay?

1220
00:57:41,530 --> 00:57:42,969
- You said I was part of the team.

1221
00:57:42,970 --> 00:57:45,479
- I said you were part of the
team, not the captain of it.

1222
00:57:45,480 --> 00:57:47,003
You'll see it in good time.

1223
00:57:47,870 --> 00:57:49,039
- No time like the present.

1224
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:50,349
- How you doing on those truck receipts

1225
00:57:50,350 --> 00:57:52,289
I asked you to look at?

1226
00:57:52,290 --> 00:57:53,343
- Jimmy and I are on it.

1227
00:57:53,344 --> 00:57:55,449
There's a ton and a half
of paper in those boxes.

1228
00:57:55,450 --> 00:57:57,503
- Well, there's no time like the present.

1229
00:57:59,156 --> 00:58:00,156
- I got it.

1230
00:58:00,946 --> 00:58:03,567
Now, are you gonna let me
see that book or what, huh?

1231
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:10,049
- You starting to get
the big picture here?

1232
00:58:10,050 --> 00:58:11,739
Now, for years we knew they were operating

1233
00:58:11,740 --> 00:58:13,449
at a higher level of sophistication,

1234
00:58:13,450 --> 00:58:15,929
but until we found that we had no idea.

1235
00:58:15,930 --> 00:58:17,489
I mean, look at that.

1236
00:58:17,490 --> 00:58:20,789
They know which side the
bank guard wears his gun on.

1237
00:58:20,790 --> 00:58:24,559
They time out railroad
crossings, police patrols,

1238
00:58:24,560 --> 00:58:28,649
money deliveries to banks,
traffic lights, landmarks.

1239
00:58:28,650 --> 00:58:31,253
They even time out the
intervals of their escapes.

1240
00:58:32,330 --> 00:58:34,619
Total precision and discipline,

1241
00:58:34,620 --> 00:58:37,963
until, until they shot Trooper Lamonaco.

1242
00:58:40,270 --> 00:58:42,209
- Yeah, Phil was just the kind of cop

1243
00:58:42,210 --> 00:58:44,059
you need on a case like this.

1244
00:58:44,060 --> 00:58:45,489
- Yeah?

1245
00:58:45,490 --> 00:58:49,389
- Instinct, he had this
incredible instinct.

1246
00:58:49,390 --> 00:58:52,949
It was like some internal radar.

1247
00:58:52,950 --> 00:58:54,279
I mean, he just,

1248
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,630
he knew when something
wasn't right with a car,

1249
00:58:58,316 --> 00:58:59,916
when a suspect had more to tell,

1250
00:59:01,300 --> 00:59:03,363
when a lead was a waste or was not.

1251
00:59:05,117 --> 00:59:06,317
He, he just, he felt it.

1252
00:59:07,570 --> 00:59:08,879
Like that day he must have sensed

1253
00:59:08,880 --> 00:59:10,419
something wasn't right with those guys,

1254
00:59:10,420 --> 00:59:13,983
and, ah, it got him killed.

1255
00:59:16,190 --> 00:59:17,990
- I'm sorry I couldn't have met him.

1256
00:59:21,016 --> 00:59:24,399
(telephone ringing)

1257
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:26,429
- You mind if I hold onto this for awhile?

1258
00:59:26,430 --> 00:59:27,639
- No, go ahead.

1259
00:59:27,640 --> 00:59:29,683
Just don't steal it.

1260
00:59:34,430 --> 00:59:37,743
- Hey ah, Val, you know
what my gut tells me?

1261
00:59:39,180 --> 00:59:41,433
That these guys are gonna
hit a bank real soon.

1262
00:59:42,410 --> 00:59:46,317
- Could be, I wouldn't bet
against anything with these guys.

1263
00:59:46,318 --> 00:59:49,318
(suspenseful music)

1264
00:59:50,517 --> 00:59:52,550
- [Ray] Let's go, come on, get
in the car, get in the car!

1265
00:59:52,551 --> 00:59:53,935
- [Tom] Out of my way!

1266
00:59:53,936 --> 00:59:55,646
- [Ray] Go, go, go, go, go!

1267
00:59:55,647 --> 00:59:57,318
(suspenseful music)

1268
00:59:57,319 --> 00:59:58,818
(tires screeching)

1269
00:59:58,819 --> 01:00:01,824
(suspenseful music)

1270
01:00:01,825 --> 01:00:05,053
(horn blowing)

1271
01:00:05,054 --> 01:00:07,721
(alarm wailing)

1272
01:00:13,554 --> 01:00:15,273
(Dickie chuckles)

1273
01:00:15,274 --> 01:00:17,941
(alarm wailing)

1274
01:00:18,844 --> 01:00:21,844
(suspenseful music)

1275
01:00:24,524 --> 01:00:26,309
- You a cop or a psychic?

1276
01:00:26,310 --> 01:00:27,469
- Why do you ask?

1277
01:00:27,470 --> 01:00:30,069
- Two o'clock this
afternoon, Bank of Onondaga,

1278
01:00:30,070 --> 01:00:33,189
upstate New York, 195 large.

1279
01:00:33,190 --> 01:00:34,299
See you tomorrow.

1280
01:00:34,300 --> 01:00:35,469
- Buy you dinner?

1281
01:00:35,470 --> 01:00:38,359
- Ah, I can't, um, it's
not what you're thinking.

1282
01:00:38,360 --> 01:00:39,669
I, I really can't.

1283
01:00:39,670 --> 01:00:41,220
Told my wife I'd be home early.

1284
01:00:42,510 --> 01:00:43,783
- Well, you lied.

1285
01:00:43,784 --> 01:00:47,369
- (scoffs) Yeah, well, raincheck though.

1286
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:48,799
- Sure.

1287
01:00:48,800 --> 01:00:49,800
- Deal.

1288
01:00:52,094 --> 01:00:55,609
(thunderous explosion)

1289
01:00:55,610 --> 01:00:57,929
- [Ray] This is the United Freedom Front.

1290
01:00:57,930 --> 01:01:01,109
The Military Industrial Complex
has destroyed this country

1291
01:01:01,110 --> 01:01:03,179
with its corporate partners.

1292
01:01:03,180 --> 01:01:04,830
It must pay for that destruction.

1293
01:01:06,396 --> 01:01:09,396
(suspenseful music)

1294
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:15,819
- [Bomb Tech] It's in the boiler room.

1295
01:01:15,820 --> 01:01:20,119
It's under a cardboard
tent that says bomb.

1296
01:01:20,120 --> 01:01:21,120
- Describe it to me.

1297
01:01:25,320 --> 01:01:26,370
- It's one of theirs.

1298
01:01:27,563 --> 01:01:31,593
Blue and yellow leg wires,
standard alarm clock.

1299
01:01:32,840 --> 01:01:35,989
The minute hand's stuck
on a piece of plastic

1300
01:01:35,990 --> 01:01:38,239
just short of the brass screw.

1301
01:01:38,240 --> 01:01:39,443
- Six volt battery?

1302
01:01:40,300 --> 01:01:41,300
- [Bomb Tech] Roger.

1303
01:01:42,440 --> 01:01:44,230
- Nothing electrical?

1304
01:01:44,231 --> 01:01:48,970
- [Bomb Tech] No, I'm gonna
try and disconnect it.

1305
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:51,971
(suspenseful music)

1306
01:02:02,030 --> 01:02:04,227
Well, that's one.

1307
01:02:05,893 --> 01:02:09,599
- It's in a phone booth block
away just like they said.

1308
01:02:09,600 --> 01:02:10,600
- What's it say?

1309
01:02:11,430 --> 01:02:14,380
- Lower company's considering
a nuclear plant on this site.

1310
01:02:15,470 --> 01:02:18,120
UFF is concerned about the
safety of the environment.

1311
01:02:19,640 --> 01:02:21,439
- So they try and blow it up.

1312
01:02:21,440 --> 01:02:23,169
Makes sense to me.

1313
01:02:23,170 --> 01:02:24,419
- Bobby, talk to me.

1314
01:02:24,420 --> 01:02:25,420
How are you doing?

1315
01:02:26,349 --> 01:02:29,349
(suspenseful music)

1316
01:02:45,350 --> 01:02:46,350
- Done.

1317
01:02:47,770 --> 01:02:48,770
- Thank God.

1318
01:02:49,618 --> 01:02:50,618
- Let me see that.

1319
01:02:52,790 --> 01:02:53,929
- You know, they're turning up the heat

1320
01:02:53,930 --> 01:02:55,053
when it should be us.

1321
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:58,649
- What are you talking about?

1322
01:02:58,650 --> 01:02:59,483
- What?

1323
01:02:59,484 --> 01:03:02,807
- You can't turn up the
heat on what you can't find!

1324
01:03:02,808 --> 01:03:05,749
Do you have any idea how
easy it is to go underground,

1325
01:03:05,750 --> 01:03:07,719
especially when you're
trained to blend in,

1326
01:03:07,720 --> 01:03:09,829
and survive the way these people are?

1327
01:03:09,830 --> 01:03:12,283
Don't talk to me about
turning up the heat!

1328
01:03:17,001 --> 01:03:18,475
- [Woman] Come on,
buddy, keep your hat on!

1329
01:03:18,476 --> 01:03:19,809
- [Man] Come on!

1330
01:03:21,659 --> 01:03:22,492
All right?

1331
01:03:22,493 --> 01:03:23,579
- [Male] Got you, Murdoch!

1332
01:03:23,580 --> 01:03:25,259
Pull it back now!

1333
01:03:25,260 --> 01:03:26,739
- [Man] Hey, buddy, go, go, go!

1334
01:03:26,740 --> 01:03:27,979
- [Coach] The deadline was a month ago.

1335
01:03:27,980 --> 01:03:29,359
- Yeah, I know, we just moved in,

1336
01:03:29,360 --> 01:03:31,089
but see, this is the third time this year

1337
01:03:31,090 --> 01:03:32,109
the kid's had to move,

1338
01:03:32,110 --> 01:03:35,329
and being on this team would
really mean a lot to him.

1339
01:03:35,330 --> 01:03:36,966
- I'm sorry, I just can't do it.

1340
01:03:36,967 --> 01:03:39,159
Way to go, Joey, nice throw!

1341
01:03:39,160 --> 01:03:40,639
- You know how it is for
a kid to try and fit in,

1342
01:03:40,640 --> 01:03:42,349
and believe he can play.

1343
01:03:42,350 --> 01:03:43,909
He's a good little shortstop.

1344
01:03:43,910 --> 01:03:47,309
- As much as I sympathize, Mr.
Howard, I need a shortstop.

1345
01:03:47,310 --> 01:03:48,960
I really can't make an exception.

1346
01:03:53,680 --> 01:03:55,603
- Couldn't you just take a look at him?

1347
01:03:57,640 --> 01:04:00,409
- Tell you what, make you deal.

1348
01:04:00,410 --> 01:04:01,819
You play ball with the boy?

1349
01:04:01,820 --> 01:04:03,379
- Yeah, we play all the time.

1350
01:04:03,380 --> 01:04:05,059
- I'm short a coach.

1351
01:04:05,060 --> 01:04:06,050
I'll put the boy on the team,

1352
01:04:06,051 --> 01:04:07,559
if you agree to back me up.

1353
01:04:07,560 --> 01:04:09,239
That way I can justify it to anybody

1354
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,289
that might get their nose outta joint.

1355
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:12,123
- Well, I'd love to,

1356
01:04:12,124 --> 01:04:15,989
but my job takes me outta
town unexpectedly, so I'd...

1357
01:04:15,990 --> 01:04:20,090
- We're only talking one,
maybe two nights a week, tops.

1358
01:04:20,091 --> 01:04:23,008
(melancholy music)

1359
01:04:27,060 --> 01:04:29,773
- I can't do it, I'm sorry.

1360
01:04:31,882 --> 01:04:33,329
- Me too.

1361
01:04:33,330 --> 01:04:34,843
Tommy, good hustle.

1362
01:04:38,210 --> 01:04:39,210
- Jamie!

1363
01:04:40,450 --> 01:04:41,550
Come on, son!

1364
01:04:41,551 --> 01:04:43,271
We're going home!

1365
01:04:43,272 --> 01:04:46,189
(melancholy music)

1366
01:04:47,517 --> 01:04:48,935
Come on, son!

1367
01:04:48,936 --> 01:04:51,853
(melancholy music)

1368
01:04:54,256 --> 01:04:55,975
I don't think it's gonna work out.

1369
01:04:55,976 --> 01:04:58,893
(melancholy music)

1370
01:05:01,400 --> 01:05:02,929
- Well, I finally made it through

1371
01:05:02,930 --> 01:05:05,349
that warehouse full of
truck rental receipts.

1372
01:05:05,350 --> 01:05:06,399
- You find a trail?

1373
01:05:06,400 --> 01:05:08,699
- No, but I thought about
something you said early on.

1374
01:05:08,700 --> 01:05:10,459
- That you should go back to Jersey?

1375
01:05:10,460 --> 01:05:12,699
- That there's a bigger picture.

1376
01:05:12,700 --> 01:05:14,039
Let's think about it.

1377
01:05:14,040 --> 01:05:17,609
Truck rentals, safe
houses, storage spaces.

1378
01:05:17,610 --> 01:05:20,599
They travel with their wives
and kids, which means schools,

1379
01:05:20,600 --> 01:05:23,989
dentists, Girl Scouts, real life.

1380
01:05:23,990 --> 01:05:25,109
The closest Jimmy and I got was when

1381
01:05:25,110 --> 01:05:27,319
we went to that elementary
school in Pennsylvania.

1382
01:05:27,320 --> 01:05:28,992
- We've already covered a
lot of that stuff, Mike.

1383
01:05:28,993 --> 01:05:29,826
- I know that,

1384
01:05:29,827 --> 01:05:32,549
but I'm thinking about
something major all over.

1385
01:05:32,550 --> 01:05:35,249
We zero in on the everyday
stuff they had to deal with,

1386
01:05:35,250 --> 01:05:36,349
terrorists or not,

1387
01:05:36,350 --> 01:05:38,519
we're bound to come up with something.

1388
01:05:38,520 --> 01:05:39,720
Think it's worth a shot?

1389
01:05:41,540 --> 01:05:43,409
- I think if the running
game stops working,

1390
01:05:43,410 --> 01:05:44,513
you start passing.

1391
01:05:45,580 --> 01:05:46,930
Just for the record though,

1392
01:05:48,190 --> 01:05:50,340
it's not gonna be good
if we come up empty.

1393
01:05:53,070 --> 01:05:54,170
- Let's give it a try.

1394
01:05:55,977 --> 01:05:56,977
- Okay.

1395
01:05:58,306 --> 01:05:59,306
- All right.

1396
01:06:03,426 --> 01:06:06,676
(thunderous explosion)

1397
01:06:16,267 --> 01:06:19,017
(birds chirping)

1398
01:06:40,269 --> 01:06:42,269
What are you doing here?

1399
01:06:45,796 --> 01:06:47,146
- For the last three months

1400
01:06:48,480 --> 01:06:49,999
I have orchestrated one of the most

1401
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:53,193
comprehensive regional
sweeps in FBI history.

1402
01:06:55,629 --> 01:06:57,799
In the last three weeks alone,

1403
01:06:57,800 --> 01:07:01,033
our agents have uncovered
where the bad guys eat,

1404
01:07:01,928 --> 01:07:03,709
where they bought clothes for their kids,

1405
01:07:03,710 --> 01:07:04,809
parts for their cars,

1406
01:07:04,810 --> 01:07:06,839
and organic toothpaste for their teeth.

1407
01:07:06,840 --> 01:07:08,469
We even found a veterinarian.

1408
01:07:08,470 --> 01:07:11,199
It turns out the damn
dog has an alias too.

1409
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:12,033
- Tell me about it.

1410
01:07:12,033 --> 01:07:12,866
Jimmy and I...

1411
01:07:12,867 --> 01:07:14,379
- You know that the Levasseurs

1412
01:07:14,380 --> 01:07:16,089
used a pediatrician in Boston

1413
01:07:16,090 --> 01:07:18,453
that's the same one my kids go to?

1414
01:07:20,460 --> 01:07:21,293
- No, I didn't.

1415
01:07:21,294 --> 01:07:25,459
- We have agents on this in
Massachusetts, Connecticut,

1416
01:07:25,460 --> 01:07:27,479
New Hampshire, New Jersey, New York,

1417
01:07:27,480 --> 01:07:29,779
Rhode Island and Vermont.

1418
01:07:29,780 --> 01:07:31,929
- So we're closing in, Val, that's great.

1419
01:07:31,930 --> 01:07:32,930
- No, it's not.

1420
01:07:33,677 --> 01:07:37,563
At 10:15 this morning they
hit a bank in Virginia.

1421
01:07:39,640 --> 01:07:40,640
Virginia!

1422
01:07:42,210 --> 01:07:43,043
They were so close,

1423
01:07:43,044 --> 01:07:45,259
I felt like I could
reach out and grab them.

1424
01:07:45,260 --> 01:07:46,960
Now they're a thousand miles away.

1425
01:07:49,950 --> 01:07:52,103
- Actually, Virginia's
only 500 miles away.

1426
01:07:57,770 --> 01:07:58,820
So don't feel so bad.

1427
01:08:02,360 --> 01:08:03,360
- Thank you.

1428
01:08:04,864 --> 01:08:07,947
(Mike clears throat)

1429
01:08:10,714 --> 01:08:12,631
- Ah, no offense, Mike,

1430
01:08:13,855 --> 01:08:15,089
but we went through this batch weeks ago.

1431
01:08:15,090 --> 01:08:16,179
- Come on, go with me, Jimmy.

1432
01:08:16,180 --> 01:08:17,013
It's in here somewhere.

1433
01:08:17,014 --> 01:08:18,313
I can feel it.

1434
01:08:18,314 --> 01:08:19,949
- You sound like Phil.

1435
01:08:19,950 --> 01:08:21,219
- We're better, right?

1436
01:08:21,220 --> 01:08:22,220
- Yeah.

1437
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:32,538
- Salvatore Bella, Salvatore Bella.

1438
01:08:32,539 --> 01:08:33,546
- [Jimmy] Yeah.

1439
01:08:33,547 --> 01:08:34,684
- Who is that?

1440
01:08:34,685 --> 01:08:35,518
- [Jimmy] Who?

1441
01:08:35,519 --> 01:08:36,859
- You don't know?

1442
01:08:36,860 --> 01:08:38,390
- [Jimmy] Mm mm.

1443
01:08:38,391 --> 01:08:40,133
- I don't know.

1444
01:08:40,134 --> 01:08:42,243
I, I've heard it or seen it somewhere.

1445
01:08:43,507 --> 01:08:46,669
(telephone ringing)

1446
01:08:46,670 --> 01:08:48,029
- Hello?

1447
01:08:48,030 --> 01:08:49,580
- [Mike] Who's Salvatore Bella?

1448
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:51,600
- Garret?

1449
01:08:51,601 --> 01:08:53,539
- Hey, Val, we're getting close.

1450
01:08:53,540 --> 01:08:55,049
Who is he?

1451
01:08:55,050 --> 01:09:00,050
- Salvatore Bella was ah, one
of Jaan Laaman's aliases, why?

1452
01:09:01,350 --> 01:09:03,422
- Guess who rented a storage
unit in Binghamton, New York

1453
01:09:03,423 --> 01:09:05,373
with a truck rented in Pennsylvania?

1454
01:09:07,210 --> 01:09:09,516
- Well, that grunt work
will do it every time.

1455
01:09:09,517 --> 01:09:12,517
(suspenseful music)

1456
01:09:43,319 --> 01:09:44,809
- You trying to catch up
on your reading, Mike?

1457
01:09:44,810 --> 01:09:46,629
- It's family stuff that's
gotten us this close,

1458
01:09:46,630 --> 01:09:48,349
you know, like magazines.

1459
01:09:48,350 --> 01:09:49,869
- What're you track them
down on what they read?

1460
01:09:49,870 --> 01:09:52,179
- No, by knowing what
they read's addressed to.

1461
01:09:52,180 --> 01:09:54,795
- There's no labels on any of these.

1462
01:09:54,796 --> 01:09:56,433
They just got 'em off the newsstands.

1463
01:09:57,826 --> 01:09:59,116
- I got a list here.

1464
01:09:59,117 --> 01:10:02,886
Look, locations of bombings with maps.

1465
01:10:02,887 --> 01:10:03,720
(finger thudding)

1466
01:10:03,721 --> 01:10:06,069
- That's trial material,
if we get to trial.

1467
01:10:06,070 --> 01:10:08,211
- When we get to trial, Val.

1468
01:10:08,212 --> 01:10:10,762
Seems that this ah, Judy
Hymes was a big Cosmo fan.

1469
01:10:11,720 --> 01:10:12,723
- Who's Judy Hymes?

1470
01:10:15,150 --> 01:10:17,409
- Judy Hymes is the woman who resides

1471
01:10:17,410 --> 01:10:20,708
at 37 Maple street,
New Haven, Connecticut.

1472
01:10:20,709 --> 01:10:22,689
(hand thuds)

1473
01:10:22,690 --> 01:10:24,277
Do you recognize this man?

1474
01:10:24,278 --> 01:10:25,528
- [Woman] Nope.

1475
01:10:28,510 --> 01:10:30,739
- What about him?

1476
01:10:30,740 --> 01:10:31,740
- Nope.

1477
01:10:34,310 --> 01:10:35,310
- [Val] Him.

1478
01:10:36,180 --> 01:10:37,599
- Oh yeah, sure, I've seen him.

1479
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:39,660
We were nextdoor neighbors
for a year and a half.

1480
01:10:41,927 --> 01:10:42,989
- Did you know him well?

1481
01:10:42,990 --> 01:10:45,939
- Oh, just to say hi really?

1482
01:10:45,940 --> 01:10:47,579
But Laurie Marsh was very close to them.

1483
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:49,209
She babysat for both of us.

1484
01:10:49,210 --> 01:10:51,719
- Any idea where we
could find her, Laurie?

1485
01:10:51,720 --> 01:10:52,553
- Oh yeah, sure.

1486
01:10:52,554 --> 01:10:54,906
She works down at the lake
at one of the concessions.

1487
01:10:54,907 --> 01:10:56,746
I can make a call.

1488
01:10:56,747 --> 01:10:57,833
- Why don't we do that?

1489
01:11:01,090 --> 01:11:04,173
Did you notice anything ah,
different about them, unusual?

1490
01:11:05,300 --> 01:11:08,009
- Not really, I mean, they
were super nice to me.

1491
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:09,129
- Mm hmm, they ever write ya?

1492
01:11:09,130 --> 01:11:10,849
- No, and that's the weird thing.

1493
01:11:10,850 --> 01:11:12,889
I mean, it's like I'm part
of the family for awhile,

1494
01:11:12,890 --> 01:11:15,623
and then not even a Christmas card.

1495
01:11:17,610 --> 01:11:20,039
I mean, especially after the accident.

1496
01:11:20,040 --> 01:11:21,489
Ah, it's just weird.

1497
01:11:21,490 --> 01:11:22,323
- Come again?

1498
01:11:22,324 --> 01:11:24,429
- Mrs. Hymes was driving.

1499
01:11:24,430 --> 01:11:25,859
I was holding the baby,

1500
01:11:25,860 --> 01:11:26,989
and like out of nowhere,

1501
01:11:26,990 --> 01:11:29,049
some guy I guess cut her off,

1502
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:30,489
'cause all of a sudden
she's like, oh my God.

1503
01:11:30,490 --> 01:11:33,519
And before I know it we're like
crashing into this building.

1504
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:36,399
Oh, but I held onto that
baby with all my might,

1505
01:11:36,400 --> 01:11:38,109
and no one got hurt or anything.

1506
01:11:38,110 --> 01:11:40,199
She was so grateful about that.

1507
01:11:40,200 --> 01:11:42,566
And they were both like,
anything you need and all,

1508
01:11:42,567 --> 01:11:45,619
and then poof, no more Hymes family,

1509
01:11:45,620 --> 01:11:47,839
or, or what did you call them?

1510
01:11:47,840 --> 01:11:50,559
- Levasseurs, Patty and Ray.

1511
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:53,589
Ah listen, did the police come
to the scene of the accident?

1512
01:11:53,590 --> 01:11:55,819
- Everybody came, it was broad daylight,

1513
01:11:55,820 --> 01:11:57,819
and we're like kapow into this wall.

1514
01:11:57,820 --> 01:11:58,653
- Laurie, do you remember?

1515
01:11:58,654 --> 01:12:01,099
Did the police file a report?

1516
01:12:01,100 --> 01:12:02,329
- Tell me about it.

1517
01:12:02,330 --> 01:12:03,829
It took them forever.

1518
01:12:03,830 --> 01:12:08,619
I was like late for my job and
my boss was like all over me.

1519
01:12:08,620 --> 01:12:11,419
Ah, so I'm babbling.

1520
01:12:11,420 --> 01:12:13,283
Is like any of this stuff helping?

1521
01:12:14,460 --> 01:12:17,709
- Chances are that police
report's just gonna have an alias.

1522
01:12:17,710 --> 01:12:20,469
Too bad our little friend,
Laurie, didn't hear which one.

1523
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:22,793
I mean like that would've
been super, dude!

1524
01:12:23,980 --> 01:12:26,419
- Laurie Marsh was in that accident too.

1525
01:12:26,420 --> 01:12:28,023
She wasn't using an alias.

1526
01:12:30,237 --> 01:12:33,489
(telephone ringing)

1527
01:12:33,490 --> 01:12:36,536
Michael Garret, James
O'Doul, meet Brenda Fisher.

1528
01:12:36,537 --> 01:12:38,969
The woman in the accident
with Laurie Marsh,

1529
01:12:38,970 --> 01:12:41,969
Brenda Fisher is also
known as Patty Levasseur.

1530
01:12:41,970 --> 01:12:44,909
Now all we have to do is find her.

1531
01:12:44,910 --> 01:12:46,610
- [Mike] Call the DMV in New York.

1532
01:12:47,500 --> 01:12:50,304
- You know they're only
gonna have a fake address.

1533
01:12:50,305 --> 01:12:51,138
It's gonna be two years old, at least.

1534
01:12:51,139 --> 01:12:52,369
- Call 'em anyways.

1535
01:12:52,370 --> 01:12:55,392
You need a point of ah, what, departure.

1536
01:12:55,393 --> 01:12:58,682
- Hey, Mike, all this stuff of theirs,

1537
01:12:58,683 --> 01:13:00,423
it's all perfectly organized.

1538
01:13:01,280 --> 01:13:04,665
I mean their domestic
lives are by the book.

1539
01:13:04,666 --> 01:13:06,906
And you know what they're
meticulous about over and over?

1540
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:11,879
Insurance.

1541
01:13:11,880 --> 01:13:13,329
- Patty Levasseur got sloppy.

1542
01:13:13,330 --> 01:13:15,299
Didn't pitch the burned ID.

1543
01:13:15,300 --> 01:13:16,859
We contacted her insurance company.

1544
01:13:16,860 --> 01:13:18,013
I have a hot address.

1545
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:19,823
- Where?

1546
01:13:19,823 --> 01:13:20,656
- Cincinnati.

1547
01:13:20,656 --> 01:13:21,655
- Cincinnati?

1548
01:13:21,655 --> 01:13:22,655
- Yeah.

1549
01:13:23,360 --> 01:13:25,139
- Well, not bad for a
couple of Jersey cops.

1550
01:13:25,140 --> 01:13:27,139
You did okay for yourselves.

1551
01:13:27,140 --> 01:13:28,689
Listen, I'd like to invite you guys along,

1552
01:13:28,690 --> 01:13:30,699
but you understand from here on out,

1553
01:13:30,700 --> 01:13:32,803
this is strictly an FBI thing, right?

1554
01:13:34,332 --> 01:13:35,919
(Gabriel laughs)

1555
01:13:35,920 --> 01:13:37,629
- He's a funny guy, huh, Jimmy?

1556
01:13:37,630 --> 01:13:38,463
- Hysterical.

1557
01:13:38,464 --> 01:13:39,882
- Yeah.

1558
01:13:39,883 --> 01:13:42,883
(suspenseful music)

1559
01:14:27,515 --> 01:14:28,769
(computer beeping)

1560
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:29,770
- [Gabriel] Okay.

1561
01:14:34,760 --> 01:14:35,600
So there's our terrorist.

1562
01:14:35,601 --> 01:14:38,469
- Yeah, looks like she
could live next door to you.

1563
01:14:38,470 --> 01:14:41,459
- Well, she probably did at
one time or another, Mike.

1564
01:14:41,460 --> 01:14:42,529
All right, one thing we know is

1565
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:44,039
this group sticks together like glue.

1566
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:45,599
All we gotta do is follow her,

1567
01:14:45,600 --> 01:14:47,779
and she will take us where we wanna go.

1568
01:14:47,780 --> 01:14:49,564
Let's get out here.

1569
01:14:49,565 --> 01:14:52,565
(suspenseful music)

1570
01:15:00,140 --> 01:15:00,973
- All right, she's ah,

1571
01:15:00,974 --> 01:15:03,035
pulling out of the parking lot right now.

1572
01:15:03,036 --> 01:15:06,036
(suspenseful music)

1573
01:15:56,875 --> 01:15:58,394
- [Man] Heading west.

1574
01:15:58,395 --> 01:16:01,395
(suspenseful music)

1575
01:17:34,150 --> 01:17:35,579
- [Mike] There's young Dickie Williams.

1576
01:17:35,580 --> 01:17:38,580
(suspenseful music)

1577
01:17:47,195 --> 01:17:48,575
Let's see where he takes us.

1578
01:17:48,576 --> 01:17:51,576
(suspenseful music)

1579
01:18:04,340 --> 01:18:07,019
- Walter, Williams is headed
your way in a yellow four door.

1580
01:18:07,020 --> 01:18:07,853
You go with him.

1581
01:18:07,854 --> 01:18:09,303
We're gonna stay with Levasseur.

1582
01:18:10,943 --> 01:18:12,171
- Yeah, we got him.

1583
01:18:12,172 --> 01:18:15,172
(suspenseful music)

1584
01:18:18,800 --> 01:18:20,255
We're on our way.

1585
01:18:20,256 --> 01:18:23,256
(suspenseful music)

1586
01:19:25,389 --> 01:19:26,389
- Whoa!

1587
01:19:27,110 --> 01:19:29,898
- Hey, guys, careful with
those packages, all right?

1588
01:19:29,899 --> 01:19:32,899
(suspenseful music)

1589
01:19:59,720 --> 01:20:01,293
- Laaman has made his appearance.

1590
01:20:02,820 --> 01:20:04,330
- [Jaan] Hey, birthday boy!

1591
01:20:04,331 --> 01:20:06,489
(Dickie chuckles)

1592
01:20:06,490 --> 01:20:09,490
(suspenseful music)

1593
01:20:18,640 --> 01:20:21,109
- He's moving away from the house.

1594
01:20:21,110 --> 01:20:22,000
- [Agent] Yeah, I see him.

1595
01:20:22,001 --> 01:20:24,202
He's walking towards two of my men.

1596
01:20:24,203 --> 01:20:27,129
(suspenseful music)

1597
01:20:27,130 --> 01:20:28,219
- Go ahead and take him.

1598
01:20:28,220 --> 01:20:29,261
- [Agent] Roger.

1599
01:20:29,262 --> 01:20:30,873
(suspenseful music)

1600
01:20:30,874 --> 01:20:31,824
(dog barks)

1601
01:20:31,825 --> 01:20:32,993
Get on the ground now!

1602
01:20:32,994 --> 01:20:34,086
- [Officer] Get down, get down!

1603
01:20:34,087 --> 01:20:36,216
- [Agent] On the ground, do it now!

1604
01:20:36,217 --> 01:20:39,289
(suspenseful music)

1605
01:20:39,290 --> 01:20:40,270
- Speed up.

1606
01:20:40,270 --> 01:20:41,270
- What?

1607
01:20:42,260 --> 01:20:43,684
- Speed up.

1608
01:20:43,685 --> 01:20:46,809
(suspenseful music)

1609
01:20:46,810 --> 01:20:48,329
- Okay, looks like they know we're here.

1610
01:20:48,330 --> 01:20:49,979
Felony car stop, let's go for it!

1611
01:20:49,980 --> 01:20:51,599
Everybody move in now!

1612
01:20:51,600 --> 01:20:53,878
- All right, turn into that
alley behind the Post Office.

1613
01:20:53,879 --> 01:20:55,189
- I don't think I can make that.

1614
01:20:55,190 --> 01:20:56,390
- You gotta make it.

1615
01:20:56,391 --> 01:20:59,391
(suspenseful music)

1616
01:21:08,871 --> 01:21:11,120
- [Agent] All right, move
out, move, move, move, go!

1617
01:21:11,121 --> 01:21:12,101
- [Officer] Get out of the van!

1618
01:21:12,102 --> 01:21:13,208
Now, get out right now!

1619
01:21:13,209 --> 01:21:14,510
- [Man] Officers, take up positions!

1620
01:21:14,511 --> 01:21:15,520
- [Male] Down on the ground now!

1621
01:21:15,521 --> 01:21:18,483
- [Officer] On the ground, stay there!

1622
01:21:18,484 --> 01:21:22,198
- [Agent] Put your hands behind you back!

1623
01:21:22,199 --> 01:21:23,703
- [Officer] Other hand!

1624
01:21:23,704 --> 01:21:26,704
(suspenseful music)

1625
01:21:29,600 --> 01:21:32,829
- Hey, Ray, it's good to finally meet you.

1626
01:21:32,830 --> 01:21:35,089
Um, you're under arrest.

1627
01:21:35,090 --> 01:21:37,019
I'd like to introduce
you to a friend of mine.

1628
01:21:37,020 --> 01:21:40,069
- Mike Garret, New Jersey State Police.

1629
01:21:40,070 --> 01:21:41,719
You remember them, right?

1630
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:43,283
- All right, get him outta here.

1631
01:21:45,109 --> 01:21:48,449
(helicopter whirring)
(agents chattering)

1632
01:21:48,450 --> 01:21:49,543
- We got two in the van!

1633
01:21:53,971 --> 01:21:55,386
That's it, come on.

1634
01:21:55,387 --> 01:21:58,387
(suspenseful music)

1635
01:22:09,029 --> 01:22:12,539
(telephone ringing)

1636
01:22:12,540 --> 01:22:13,410
- Hello?

1637
01:22:13,411 --> 01:22:14,997
- Hey, happy birthday.

1638
01:22:14,998 --> 01:22:16,049
- Well, thank you.

1639
01:22:16,050 --> 01:22:17,677
What time are you guys coming over?

1640
01:22:17,678 --> 01:22:18,511
- We're coming right now.

1641
01:22:18,512 --> 01:22:19,849
Let me talk to Barbara.

1642
01:22:19,850 --> 01:22:20,957
- Barbara, Carol!

1643
01:22:22,090 --> 01:22:25,090
(suspenseful music)

1644
01:22:35,180 --> 01:22:36,739
- Hi.

1645
01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:38,069
- Do you need anything brought over?

1646
01:22:38,070 --> 01:22:39,359
- Yeah, some birthday candles.

1647
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:40,193
Can you believe it?

1648
01:22:40,194 --> 01:22:41,419
I forgot the birthday...

1649
01:22:41,420 --> 01:22:42,253
(phone beeps)

1650
01:22:42,253 --> 01:22:43,086
Uh, oh, hold on a second.

1651
01:22:43,086 --> 01:22:43,919
It's my other line.

1652
01:22:43,920 --> 01:22:45,579
- Sure.

1653
01:22:45,580 --> 01:22:46,500
- Hello?

1654
01:22:46,501 --> 01:22:48,379
- This is FBI Special
Agent Walter Ellison.

1655
01:22:48,380 --> 01:22:49,353
You are surrounded...

1656
01:22:49,353 --> 01:22:50,186
(phone beeps)

1657
01:22:50,187 --> 01:22:53,054
- Carol, it's the cops, get out!

1658
01:22:53,055 --> 01:22:55,259
(suspenseful music)

1659
01:22:55,260 --> 01:22:56,707
- SWAT, get in there, go, go, go!

1660
01:22:56,708 --> 01:23:01,708
(door thuds)
(agents shouting)

1661
01:23:03,761 --> 01:23:04,597
- [Agent] FBI, don't move!

1662
01:23:04,598 --> 01:23:06,246
- [Officer] That a girl, come on.

1663
01:23:06,247 --> 01:23:09,247
(suspenseful music)

1664
01:23:14,931 --> 01:23:15,893
- I wanna call a lawyer.

1665
01:23:15,894 --> 01:23:18,319
- Well, I want to call Thomas Manning,

1666
01:23:18,320 --> 01:23:19,569
but I don't have his phone number.

1667
01:23:19,570 --> 01:23:21,619
Now, maybe you could give that to me.

1668
01:23:21,620 --> 01:23:23,070
An address would be nice too.

1669
01:23:26,530 --> 01:23:28,130
- Law says I get one phone call.

1670
01:23:30,720 --> 01:23:32,553
- Well, you know what?

1671
01:23:34,310 --> 01:23:36,889
You're absolutely right, you do.

1672
01:23:36,890 --> 01:23:40,099
So, why don't we take him to a telephone?

1673
01:23:40,100 --> 01:23:42,130
- Let's get you a phone, get up.

1674
01:23:44,361 --> 01:23:45,270
(Dickie grunts)

1675
01:23:45,270 --> 01:23:46,103
- [Mike] Easy, easy.

1676
01:23:46,104 --> 01:23:47,477
- Hey, take it easy now (grunts).

1677
01:23:54,750 --> 01:23:56,299
Hey, you said I could call a lawyer.

1678
01:23:56,300 --> 01:23:58,480
- Oh, you can, Dickie, you can.

1679
01:23:58,481 --> 01:23:59,490
- You killed a cop in New Jersey.

1680
01:23:59,491 --> 01:24:01,079
That's where you get
to make your call from.

1681
01:24:01,080 --> 01:24:02,819
That's the good news, Dickie.

1682
01:24:02,820 --> 01:24:05,609
The bad news is the cop you killed,

1683
01:24:05,610 --> 01:24:07,039
he was my best friend.

1684
01:24:07,040 --> 01:24:08,869
His son is my Godchild,

1685
01:24:08,870 --> 01:24:11,429
so this is your worse
nightmare come true, pal,

1686
01:24:11,430 --> 01:24:13,829
'cause my partner and I are
gonna drive you there tonight.

1687
01:24:13,830 --> 01:24:16,319
And when you get there,
you could call your lawyer,

1688
01:24:16,320 --> 01:24:17,359
if you get there.

1689
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:19,149
- Hey, what the hell is this?

1690
01:24:19,150 --> 01:24:20,199
You can't let this happen!

1691
01:24:20,200 --> 01:24:21,309
This is illegal!

1692
01:24:21,310 --> 01:24:23,449
- Only if they find the body.

1693
01:24:23,450 --> 01:24:25,390
- All right, all right.

1694
01:24:26,521 --> 01:24:27,600
You want Manning?

1695
01:24:27,601 --> 01:24:28,434
(door thuds)
(suspenseful music)

1696
01:24:28,434 --> 01:24:29,267
- [Agent] FBI, coming in!

1697
01:24:29,268 --> 01:24:34,267
(agents shouting)
(suspenseful music)

1698
01:24:41,408 --> 01:24:42,991
Let's go back here!

1699
01:24:44,653 --> 01:24:47,922
- [Officer] Check the crawlspace!

1700
01:24:47,923 --> 01:24:49,923
- [Detective] All clear!

1701
01:24:52,501 --> 01:24:53,584
- Still warm.

1702
01:24:55,950 --> 01:24:56,950
- So damn close.

1703
01:25:01,271 --> 01:25:03,854
(bell tolling)

1704
01:25:08,435 --> 01:25:13,435
(birds chirping)
(dog barking)

1705
01:25:19,058 --> 01:25:21,827
- [Jamie] I'll be out front.

1706
01:25:21,828 --> 01:25:24,677
- Son, you watch out for cars, okay?

1707
01:25:24,678 --> 01:25:25,928
- [Jamie] Okay.

1708
01:25:30,108 --> 01:25:32,608
(Carol sighs)

1709
01:25:33,460 --> 01:25:35,660
- We're gonna be outta
money in a few weeks.

1710
01:25:36,580 --> 01:25:37,780
Might have to do a bank.

1711
01:25:40,528 --> 01:25:42,328
- You know, Tom, I've been thinking.

1712
01:25:44,510 --> 01:25:46,320
Maybe enough time has passed, huh?

1713
01:25:47,270 --> 01:25:48,270
- For what?

1714
01:25:49,088 --> 01:25:51,533
- For us to live our lives.

1715
01:25:52,910 --> 01:25:54,210
Got the rest of the group.

1716
01:25:55,618 --> 01:25:58,183
They must know that Dickie
pulled the trigger on that cop.

1717
01:26:00,100 --> 01:26:01,550
Maybe they've given up on us.

1718
01:26:02,850 --> 01:26:04,350
- Oh, honey, I don't think so.

1719
01:26:07,357 --> 01:26:10,910
- Maybe not given up, but we
haven't pulled a bank job,

1720
01:26:12,250 --> 01:26:14,543
or bombed a building
since that Ohio thing.

1721
01:26:15,409 --> 01:26:16,813
We know how to fake IDs.

1722
01:26:19,900 --> 01:26:21,479
If we never did anything illegal again,

1723
01:26:21,480 --> 01:26:22,763
we'd never be burned.

1724
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:27,753
We could just get real jobs and live.

1725
01:26:31,659 --> 01:26:33,639
- You make it sound like the
Witness Protection Program.

1726
01:26:33,640 --> 01:26:38,419
I, I just don't know if it's possible.

1727
01:26:38,420 --> 01:26:40,909
- Those guys that bombed the
University of Wisconsin in '69

1728
01:26:40,910 --> 01:26:43,199
are still out there somewhere, Tom.

1729
01:26:43,200 --> 01:26:44,200
It is possible.

1730
01:26:45,550 --> 01:26:46,550
- Yeah.

1731
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:50,879
It's been so quiet around here lately,

1732
01:26:50,880 --> 01:26:52,230
I almost forgot who we are.

1733
01:26:55,639 --> 01:26:58,806
- I wanna forget, not for us, for him.

1734
01:27:01,110 --> 01:27:04,909
(birds chirping)
(children laughing)

1735
01:27:04,910 --> 01:27:06,610
- That's something to think about.

1736
01:27:09,094 --> 01:27:11,319
- Supper's almost ready, huh?

1737
01:27:11,320 --> 01:27:13,809
Jamie, honey, time for dinner!

1738
01:27:13,810 --> 01:27:15,219
Come wash up!

1739
01:27:15,220 --> 01:27:16,540
- [Jamie] In a little bit!

1740
01:27:33,703 --> 01:27:36,120
(gun clicks)

1741
01:27:37,073 --> 01:27:38,740
- What about my son?

1742
01:27:39,660 --> 01:27:40,710
- It's taken care of.

1743
01:27:44,720 --> 01:27:48,049
- Thomas Manning, you're under arrest

1744
01:27:48,050 --> 01:27:49,979
for the murder of Philip Lamonaco,

1745
01:27:49,980 --> 01:27:51,613
among other things, get up.

1746
01:27:55,604 --> 01:27:58,521
(melancholy music)

1747
01:28:02,383 --> 01:28:04,393
(Carol gasps)

1748
01:28:04,394 --> 01:28:07,779
(melancholy music)

1749
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:09,353
- No, I have to see my son!

1750
01:28:12,160 --> 01:28:13,794
No!

1751
01:28:13,795 --> 01:28:15,509
Bye, sweetie.

1752
01:28:15,510 --> 01:28:16,783
Oh, I'm so sorry, Jamie.

1753
01:28:18,750 --> 01:28:20,573
Forgive us, oh.

1754
01:28:21,893 --> 01:28:23,241
- [Jamie] I don't you to go.

1755
01:28:23,242 --> 01:28:26,252
(Carol crying)

1756
01:28:26,253 --> 01:28:28,577
(melancholy music)

1757
01:28:28,578 --> 01:28:29,921
- Let's go, Manning.

1758
01:28:29,922 --> 01:28:31,439
Mrs. Manning.

1759
01:28:31,440 --> 01:28:34,357
(melancholy music)

1760
01:28:36,009 --> 01:28:37,439
- I love you.

1761
01:28:37,440 --> 01:28:41,433
- Son, remember your name
is Jamie Manning, okay?

1762
01:28:42,869 --> 01:28:45,786
(melancholy music)

1763
01:29:00,330 --> 01:29:01,949
- Good job.

1764
01:29:01,950 --> 01:29:04,867
(melancholy music)

1765
01:29:19,200 --> 01:29:21,509
- [Announcer] Thomas Manning
and Richard Dickie Williams

1766
