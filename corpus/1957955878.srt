1
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,219
Good evening, my victims.

2
00:01:39,220 --> 00:01:41,640
It is I, Malvolia, the Queen of
Screams.

3
00:01:43,060 --> 00:01:44,060
Remember me?

4
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:47,559
The last day of October is upon
us.

5
00:01:47,560 --> 00:01:50,859
That's right, today is All
Hallow's Eve,

6
00:01:50,860 --> 00:01:52,939
which can only mean one thing.

7
00:01:52,940 --> 00:01:56,399
Welcome back to my
Halloween Monster Marathon,

8
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,489
where creatures lurk in the
shadows

9
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,279
awaiting trick or treaters
to leave their houses

10
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:03,489
and disappear into the night.

11
00:02:03,490 --> 00:02:06,039
But what happens when
trouble does come about?

12
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:08,329
Will everyone make it out alive?

13
00:02:08,330 --> 00:02:10,250
We can only hope they don't.

14
00:03:29,700 --> 00:03:30,909
Bye, honey.

15
00:03:30,910 --> 00:03:32,039
Have fun.

16
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:33,669
Tell Karen I said hi.

17
00:03:33,670 --> 00:03:34,959
I will.

18
00:03:34,960 --> 00:03:36,089
Pick me up at midnight?

19
00:03:36,090 --> 00:03:38,169
Okay, just give me a
call if you need me sooner.

20
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:40,420
- Okay, love you.
- Bye.

21
00:03:55,020 --> 00:03:59,030
I'd turn back if I were you.

22
00:04:04,320 --> 00:04:07,069
- Hey, happy Halloween.
- Hi, Ms. Jacobs.

23
00:04:07,070 --> 00:04:08,989
Happy Halloween.

24
00:04:08,990 --> 00:04:10,080
Come on in.

25
00:04:13,710 --> 00:04:15,539
How are you, how's college?

26
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:16,579
School's good.

27
00:04:16,580 --> 00:04:17,959
My mom says hello.

28
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:19,129
Oh, I miss her at church.

29
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:20,000
And work, work's good?

30
00:04:20,001 --> 00:04:21,709
You're still at the video store?

31
00:04:21,710 --> 00:04:22,839
Yeah, Play It Again Video.

32
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:24,469
Be kind and rewind.

33
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,259
That's pretty adorable.

34
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:27,090
What is that, a birthmark?

35
00:04:27,091 --> 00:04:29,060
I never noticed that before.
Uh, yeah.

36
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:32,219
Kind of like a little
triangle, I like it.

37
00:04:32,220 --> 00:04:33,639
Stan!

38
00:04:33,640 --> 00:04:34,480
Move your ass.

39
00:04:34,481 --> 00:04:36,440
Just grabbing my coat, fuck!

40
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:39,940
Hello, Holly, blah, blah.

41
00:04:40,900 --> 00:04:41,730
Hi.

42
00:04:41,731 --> 00:04:43,030
Where's your makeup?

43
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,319
I'm not wearing it.

44
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:46,160
What?

45
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,870
Jesus, fuck, I am not wearing
it.

46
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:52,539
All right, so we'll be
back at 11:30 or midnight.

47
00:04:52,540 --> 00:04:53,749
The McLaren's phone number

48
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:54,580
is by the phone.
Okay.

49
00:04:54,581 --> 00:04:56,579
So, just call if there's an
emergency.

50
00:04:56,580 --> 00:04:58,039
Tommy's in his room making a
mask,

51
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,919
so, he's still on that silent
kick,

52
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:03,300
just kind of be patient with
him.

53
00:05:52,140 --> 00:05:53,639
Hey, sport.

54
00:05:53,640 --> 00:05:54,640
High five?

55
00:05:56,640 --> 00:05:58,309
Or not.

56
00:05:58,310 --> 00:06:00,899
Well, I've got a surprise for
you.

57
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:03,939
Snagged this baby from work,

58
00:06:03,940 --> 00:06:06,940
"Cannibalistic Humanoid From
Detroit".

59
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:10,909
80's trash cinema for a price.

60
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:13,870
Cameron gets to come over, and
you don't tell your parents?

61
00:06:14,700 --> 00:06:16,289
You like Cam, right?

62
00:06:16,290 --> 00:06:17,290
Deal?

63
00:06:19,330 --> 00:06:20,459
Okay.

64
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:22,790
I'll go make you a sandwich.

65
00:07:13,590 --> 00:07:18,600
And nothing will stand
in my way.

66
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:25,190
Trick or treat.

67
00:07:26,150 --> 00:07:28,569
Not in the house, you fucking
retard.

68
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:33,200
What are you doing?
Oh, right, right.

69
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:38,040
What, this sweet shit's
expensive, okay.

70
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,700
Oh, okay.

71
00:07:43,870 --> 00:07:44,790
It's done.

72
00:07:44,791 --> 00:07:46,249
The demo?

73
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,250
Yup.

74
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,289
This one?

75
00:08:22,290 --> 00:08:24,419
It's called "March of the Death
Witch".

76
00:08:24,420 --> 00:08:25,919
What do you think?

77
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,499
- Death Wish?
- No.

78
00:08:27,500 --> 00:08:30,089
Witch, like Death Witch.

79
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:32,379
Oh, so this is like death
metal?

80
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:33,220
No.

81
00:08:33,221 --> 00:08:34,969
- Or thresh metal?
- No.

82
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:37,299
This is black metal.

83
00:08:37,300 --> 00:08:39,759
Black metal, you know.

84
00:08:39,760 --> 00:08:41,849
Black, like in evil.

85
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:43,349
They started doing it in Norway,

86
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:46,309
and then we started doing it
here, and it fucking kills.

87
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:48,149
Yeah, totally.

88
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:51,320
Um, why does it sound like
it's recorded in the bathroom?

89
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:55,780
I mean, it's supposed to,
it's raw, you know, gritty.

90
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,819
Yep, well.

91
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,369
Hold that thought, I gotta give
the little squid his dinner.

92
00:09:02,370 --> 00:09:03,370
Okay.

93
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:07,119
Doesn't sound like it was
recorded in my bathroom.

94
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:09,039
She didn't get it.

95
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:11,129
Nobody gets it.

96
00:09:11,130 --> 00:09:12,130
Right, Bill?

97
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:23,269
Wait.

98
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:24,769
Did you hear that?

99
00:09:24,770 --> 00:09:25,600
What?

100
00:09:25,601 --> 00:09:27,059
Turn off the music.

101
00:09:27,060 --> 00:09:28,649
Why?

102
00:09:28,650 --> 00:09:30,229
Turn off the fucking music.

103
00:09:30,230 --> 00:09:31,230
Okay, sorry.

104
00:09:38,820 --> 00:09:40,529
It sounds like it's
coming from the basement.

105
00:09:40,530 --> 00:09:44,289
It's, I don't know, probably
Tommy playing or something.

106
00:09:44,290 --> 00:09:45,700
No, he's in his room.

107
00:09:47,210 --> 00:09:48,500
I don't know.

108
00:09:55,340 --> 00:09:58,179
Tommy, you down there?

109
00:09:58,180 --> 00:10:01,300
It's probably just a raccoon,
you know.

110
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:08,680
Really?

111
00:10:17,780 --> 00:10:20,200
A raccoon did this?

112
00:10:28,250 --> 00:10:29,749
Come here, little fella.

113
00:10:29,750 --> 00:10:31,250
I got a sandwich for you.

114
00:10:52,400 --> 00:10:53,609
Ew.

115
00:10:53,610 --> 00:10:54,860
That's no raccoon.

116
00:10:56,940 --> 00:10:57,940
No.

117
00:11:04,950 --> 00:11:06,949
Come on, motherfucker!

118
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:08,329
No!

119
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:10,209
Don't, he's my friend.

120
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:12,829
Tommy, who is this?

121
00:11:12,830 --> 00:11:14,459
He's my friend.

122
00:11:14,460 --> 00:11:15,879
I found him in the woods nearby.

123
00:11:15,880 --> 00:11:17,839
He was alone and needed some
help.

124
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:19,419
Do your parents know he's down
here?

125
00:11:19,420 --> 00:11:21,879
No, they never come down here.

126
00:11:21,880 --> 00:11:24,219
They can't know, please.

127
00:11:24,220 --> 00:11:26,389
Well, we have to tell someone.

128
00:11:26,390 --> 00:11:28,519
He's lost, and there might be
somebody

129
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:29,640
out there looking for him.

130
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:31,310
Are you fucking kidding me?

131
00:11:31,311 --> 00:11:32,979
Did you hear the sounds that
thing makes?

132
00:11:32,980 --> 00:11:34,689
There's nobody looking for that
thing.

133
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,149
It's probably hopped up on
something.

134
00:11:37,150 --> 00:11:40,529
Well, he can't stay
down here, it's not safe.

135
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:42,029
I'm gonna have to call your mom.

136
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,239
Please.

137
00:11:43,240 --> 00:11:44,240
Please, don't.

138
00:11:54,580 --> 00:11:56,170
You're supposed to be quiet.

139
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:02,510
No, not yet.

140
00:12:14,770 --> 00:12:18,360
Here, give me, give
me, give me, give me.

141
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:32,830
Hey, thanks for coming!

142
00:12:32,831 --> 00:12:34,290
Thanks for having us!

143
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:48,680
Nothing.

144
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:52,520
I guess we try the cops now?

145
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:09,279
Tommy!

146
00:13:09,280 --> 00:13:10,779
What the fuck, dude?

147
00:13:10,780 --> 00:13:12,409
You're gonna be in big
trouble, mister.

148
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:13,410
Big trouble.

149
00:13:15,790 --> 00:13:17,709
We'll just drive to the
McLaren's.

150
00:13:17,710 --> 00:13:19,250
What the fuck?

151
00:13:23,550 --> 00:13:25,339
Fuckin' swear to God he's
gonna be the next Dahmer.

152
00:13:25,340 --> 00:13:26,589
If I were his parents, I'd beat
his ass

153
00:13:26,590 --> 00:13:27,720
every fuckin' day.

154
00:13:29,390 --> 00:13:31,049
- What?
- Aw, shit.

155
00:13:31,050 --> 00:13:32,639
- What?
- I don't have my keys.

156
00:13:32,640 --> 00:13:33,430
Well, where are they?

157
00:13:33,431 --> 00:13:34,679
I don't know, I put them in my
jacket,

158
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:36,349
but they're obviously not there
anymore.

159
00:13:36,350 --> 00:13:37,190
Well...

160
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:38,190
Do you have them?

161
00:13:42,070 --> 00:13:43,479
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

162
00:13:43,480 --> 00:13:44,690
Cam, wait!

163
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:49,449
You've gotta be fucking
kidding me!

164
00:13:49,450 --> 00:13:51,449
I'm gonna kick your ass, you
little shit!

165
00:13:51,450 --> 00:13:52,450
Give me those keys!

166
00:13:52,450 --> 00:13:53,290
Cam, let's just go,

167
00:13:53,291 --> 00:13:55,409
we can walk to the McLaren's.

168
00:13:55,410 --> 00:13:57,409
We're miles from anyone, okay?

169
00:13:57,410 --> 00:13:58,830
Where are we gonna go?

170
00:13:59,750 --> 00:14:01,710
Hey, he's coming around.

171
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:05,550
Please, can we go?

172
00:14:12,390 --> 00:14:13,390
Cam!

173
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:15,720
Baby, come on, get up.

174
00:14:15,721 --> 00:14:16,889
Where is that little kid?

175
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,479
Please, get up, get up, get
up.

176
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,439
Baby, come on, come on.

177
00:14:20,440 --> 00:14:22,160
- Holly, watch out.
- Let's go, we gotta go.

178
00:14:25,030 --> 00:14:26,030
Cam, Cam.

179
00:14:48,590 --> 00:14:51,640
Tommy, we are way past telling
your mom!

180
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:01,770
Where are you?

181
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,080
It wasn't
supposed to be like this!

182
00:15:38,430 --> 00:15:39,430
Tommy?

183
00:15:40,350 --> 00:15:41,350
Tommy?

184
00:15:50,740 --> 00:15:52,359
Cam?

185
00:15:52,360 --> 00:15:53,360
Cam?

186
00:15:54,110 --> 00:15:57,119
Oh, oh, oh baby, oh my God.

187
00:15:57,120 --> 00:15:58,989
Baby, I'm gonna need
you to get up now, okay?

188
00:15:58,990 --> 00:15:59,910
We're gonna have to walk,

189
00:15:59,911 --> 00:16:01,039
we have to get out of here.

190
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,709
Okay, can you get up?

191
00:16:02,710 --> 00:16:03,710
Are you...

192
00:16:03,711 --> 00:16:05,879
No, you're okay, it's okay,
you're safe.

193
00:16:05,880 --> 00:16:06,710
Okay.

194
00:16:06,711 --> 00:16:07,839
Oh my fucking God, I don't even
know

195
00:16:07,840 --> 00:16:10,260
what the fuck just happened.

196
00:16:19,810 --> 00:16:20,810
Holly.

197
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:22,560
No!

198
00:16:56,300 --> 00:16:57,300
No, no, no!

199
00:16:58,930 --> 00:17:00,010
Please don't.

200
00:17:02,680 --> 00:17:03,680
No!

201
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:08,520
Oh, God!

202
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:17,570
Oh God, oh God.

203
00:17:27,080 --> 00:17:28,880
What are you doing?

204
00:17:39,340 --> 00:17:42,180
You weren't supposed to be
here.

205
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:50,020
Hey!

206
00:17:57,530 --> 00:17:58,530
Oh, God!

207
00:18:08,160 --> 00:18:09,920
What are you doing to him?

208
00:18:17,010 --> 00:18:18,679
Oh, God.

209
00:18:18,680 --> 00:18:20,300
Oh, God, no.

210
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:29,900
Baby, please, no.

211
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:32,440
No, no, no!

212
00:18:41,990 --> 00:18:44,740
He never eats the face.

213
00:18:53,880 --> 00:18:55,380
Oh, God!

214
00:19:38,800 --> 00:19:39,800
Help!

215
00:19:41,260 --> 00:19:42,719
Whoa, whoa, missy.

216
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:43,550
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

217
00:19:43,551 --> 00:19:46,049
It's okay, settle down.

218
00:19:46,050 --> 00:19:46,890
All right?

219
00:19:46,891 --> 00:19:48,219
You're safe, you're safe, all
right?

220
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:50,979
Now, what's going on?

221
00:19:50,980 --> 00:19:52,480
He killed him.

222
00:19:53,350 --> 00:19:54,399
He's fucking dead.

223
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:55,519
He's dead.

224
00:19:55,520 --> 00:19:56,859
Now slow down, okay?

225
00:19:56,860 --> 00:19:57,860
Slow down now.

226
00:19:57,861 --> 00:20:00,439
Take a breath, take a breath,
all right?

227
00:20:00,440 --> 00:20:02,069
Now, a kid killed who?

228
00:20:02,070 --> 00:20:03,949
He killed my boyfriend.

229
00:20:03,950 --> 00:20:06,909
And then he fed him to that
thing,

230
00:20:06,910 --> 00:20:08,869
I don't know what...

231
00:20:08,870 --> 00:20:09,700
It's okay.

232
00:20:09,701 --> 00:20:11,409
Let's get you somewhere warm,
all right?

233
00:20:11,410 --> 00:20:12,410
Okay?

234
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:16,000
What are you doing out here?

235
00:20:17,170 --> 00:20:18,670
I'm just looking for my dog.

236
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,630
What?

237
00:20:22,380 --> 00:20:23,880
What the fuck?

238
00:20:25,550 --> 00:20:26,680
Please, please.

239
00:20:28,010 --> 00:20:29,599
What are you doing?

240
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:32,599
Well, you saw it, didn't you?

241
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:34,100
Isn't it incredible?

242
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,859
Who are you people?

243
00:20:36,860 --> 00:20:39,609
I'm sorry, missy, but fate
brought you here tonight.

244
00:20:39,610 --> 00:20:40,610
What...

245
00:21:34,500 --> 00:21:36,539
Wake up, little missy.

246
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:38,830
You don't want to miss your
special day.

247
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:03,730
Hi, honey.

248
00:22:03,731 --> 00:22:05,990
How we doing, honey?

249
00:22:07,240 --> 00:22:08,240
Why?

250
00:22:08,241 --> 00:22:09,450
Don't be scared.

251
00:22:10,370 --> 00:22:11,409
You should only be excited,

252
00:22:11,410 --> 00:22:14,120
for you are a part of something
so big.

253
00:22:15,700 --> 00:22:19,209
Your son, he had this thing,

254
00:22:19,210 --> 00:22:21,839
this creature in the basement.

255
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:23,209
Creature?

256
00:22:23,210 --> 00:22:25,509
Oh, he's no creature, honey,
he's family.

257
00:22:25,510 --> 00:22:27,339
He's been with us the whole
time,

258
00:22:27,340 --> 00:22:28,929
for hundreds of years.

259
00:22:28,930 --> 00:22:32,009
And tonight is his night,

260
00:22:32,010 --> 00:22:33,430
for tonight is Samhain.

261
00:22:34,890 --> 00:22:36,809
You're fucking psychotic.

262
00:22:36,810 --> 00:22:38,690
All you people are psychotic.

263
00:22:42,560 --> 00:22:44,439
I'm truly sorry for your
boyfriend.

264
00:22:44,440 --> 00:22:46,069
Cameron, was it?

265
00:22:46,070 --> 00:22:47,439
I mean, he seemed like a nice
boy.

266
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:50,490
A little too old for you, but a
nice boy.

267
00:22:51,450 --> 00:22:52,909
But he shouldn't have
been here tonight, though.

268
00:22:52,910 --> 00:22:53,910
You know the rules.

269
00:22:55,740 --> 00:22:56,910
I loved him.

270
00:22:57,750 --> 00:22:59,620
I know, honey, I know.

271
00:23:00,540 --> 00:23:02,579
And he served his purpose.

272
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:05,669
But you are the main treat.

273
00:23:05,670 --> 00:23:08,049
You won't get away with this.

274
00:23:08,050 --> 00:23:10,259
My mom knows I'm here.

275
00:23:10,260 --> 00:23:12,389
Your mom's the reason why
you're here,

276
00:23:12,390 --> 00:23:13,680
and we thank her for that.

277
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:15,600
I don't believe you.

278
00:23:15,601 --> 00:23:17,179
Be strong, baby.

279
00:23:17,180 --> 00:23:18,769
Mom?

280
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:19,979
Mom?

281
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:20,810
Mom?

282
00:23:20,811 --> 00:23:23,349
Mom, please, mom, help me.

283
00:23:23,350 --> 00:23:25,479
I always knew you were
special.

284
00:23:25,480 --> 00:23:27,729
This is your birthright.

285
00:23:27,730 --> 00:23:29,649
Where you're going is
gonna be so much better

286
00:23:29,650 --> 00:23:31,779
than this shit hole of an Earth.

287
00:23:31,780 --> 00:23:33,239
I promise.

288
00:23:33,240 --> 00:23:34,410
Mom, please!

289
00:23:36,780 --> 00:23:38,289
It's time.

290
00:23:38,290 --> 00:23:39,290
Tommy?

291
00:24:08,940 --> 00:24:09,940
No!

292
00:24:13,240 --> 00:24:14,530
Go get your brother.

293
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:20,040
No!

294
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,329
He eats once every five years.

295
00:24:24,330 --> 00:24:26,500
On tonight, in the last
minutes of Samhain.

296
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:31,969
And we gather to pay
witness, for it is time.

297
00:24:31,970 --> 00:24:33,969
For it is time.

298
00:24:33,970 --> 00:24:34,800
Wait.

299
00:24:34,801 --> 00:24:36,639
Wait, no, no, he eats
once every five years,

300
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:38,509
he already ate.

301
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:39,470
He already ate!

302
00:24:39,471 --> 00:24:41,519
Cameron was just a bonus.

303
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:44,439
And maybe it was fate that
brought him here tonight too,

304
00:24:44,440 --> 00:24:46,939
but in the last minutes, it's
you,

305
00:24:46,940 --> 00:24:48,270
the marked one that counts.

306
00:24:49,270 --> 00:24:51,859
So, tonight he eats twice.

307
00:24:51,860 --> 00:24:53,949
And don't worry, that pretty
face.

308
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,070
He never eats the face.

309
00:25:07,920 --> 00:25:09,340
Why me?

310
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:12,380
Why?

311
00:25:20,180 --> 00:25:22,310
Don't be scared, sweetie.

312
00:25:23,810 --> 00:25:24,810
No!

313
00:25:26,730 --> 00:25:27,979
No!

314
00:25:27,980 --> 00:25:29,689
No, God, please!

315
00:25:29,690 --> 00:25:31,859
Please, please, please!

316
00:25:31,860 --> 00:25:34,569
Someone help, please don't!

317
00:25:34,570 --> 00:25:35,570
No, please!

318
00:25:36,740 --> 00:25:37,989
No!

319
00:25:37,990 --> 00:25:38,990
No!

320
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,459
Please, please someone, please
help me.

321
00:25:49,460 --> 00:25:50,919
Please!

322
00:25:50,920 --> 00:25:51,840
No!

323
00:25:51,840 --> 00:25:52,840
Mom, please!

324
00:25:55,800 --> 00:25:57,129
Back off!

325
00:25:57,130 --> 00:25:58,550
Fuckin' back off!

326
00:25:59,430 --> 00:26:00,430
No, please!

327
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:04,220
Please, someone please!

328
00:26:13,780 --> 00:26:14,780
Mom, mom!

329
00:26:17,030 --> 00:26:18,030
No!

330
00:26:36,800 --> 00:26:37,800
No!

331
00:26:44,810 --> 00:26:45,810
You bitch!

332
00:28:07,810 --> 00:28:09,349
God, dude, did you have to
swerve around

333
00:28:09,350 --> 00:28:10,850
every frickin' street corner?

334
00:28:15,980 --> 00:28:17,899
Look, not to be an asshole,

335
00:28:17,900 --> 00:28:20,030
but I'm gonna have to
leave you four stars.

336
00:28:22,400 --> 00:28:23,400
You still here?

337
00:28:24,990 --> 00:28:25,950
All right.

338
00:28:25,951 --> 00:28:27,120
One star it is then.

339
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,290
Awesome.

340
00:28:31,370 --> 00:28:32,210
Happy Halloween.

341
00:28:32,211 --> 00:28:33,289
Yeah, Happy Halloween to you
too,

342
00:28:33,290 --> 00:28:34,670
you fuckin' asshole.

343
00:29:13,540 --> 00:29:15,789
Well, it's
that ghastly night once again,

344
00:29:15,790 --> 00:29:17,169
boils and ghouls.

345
00:29:17,170 --> 00:29:19,209
Geez, again with the puns?

346
00:29:19,210 --> 00:29:20,549
Not even original ones either?

347
00:29:20,550 --> 00:29:23,339
And here at 104.4
KRAS,

348
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:25,589
your host, Chad the Krasshole
himself,

349
00:29:25,590 --> 00:29:28,299
along with his trusty
sidekick, Chet Chunkers.

350
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,259
We will be trick or treating you

351
00:29:30,260 --> 00:29:34,059
to some bone rattling
tunes all night long.

352
00:29:34,060 --> 00:29:35,429
Krasshole and
myself are celebrating

353
00:29:35,430 --> 00:29:38,059
all Hollow seasons in spooky
fashion,

354
00:29:38,060 --> 00:29:40,860
spinning some truly terrifying
tunes...

355
00:30:21,150 --> 00:30:22,150
Hello?

356
00:30:23,070 --> 00:30:24,109
Hey!

357
00:30:24,110 --> 00:30:25,110
Where are you?

358
00:30:26,110 --> 00:30:26,990
I'm on the road.

359
00:30:26,991 --> 00:30:28,240
Aw, no, working?

360
00:30:30,660 --> 00:30:31,660
Yup.

361
00:30:31,661 --> 00:30:32,779
Halloween's good money.

362
00:30:32,780 --> 00:30:34,409
Halloween's not for making
money,

363
00:30:34,410 --> 00:30:38,459
Halloween's for mood and
atmosphere!

364
00:30:38,460 --> 00:30:42,079
Halloween is for chills, and
spooks,

365
00:30:42,080 --> 00:30:44,249
and the grotesque.

366
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,089
Halloween's not for making
money.

367
00:30:46,090 --> 00:30:49,380
Well, every day's the same
when you're broke, babe.

368
00:30:51,050 --> 00:30:52,889
You know what I'm gonna say.

369
00:30:52,890 --> 00:30:54,889
Broke is not a mindset.

370
00:30:54,890 --> 00:30:57,430
Broke is a mindset, Jeremy.

371
00:30:59,520 --> 00:31:01,559
Right, well, tomorrow's the
first,

372
00:31:01,560 --> 00:31:03,559
and I can't pay bills with a
mindset,

373
00:31:03,560 --> 00:31:06,230
so, it's the road for me.

374
00:31:07,110 --> 00:31:08,110
All right, well.

375
00:31:08,111 --> 00:31:10,529
Do you know when you will be
home?

376
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,280
Because I have a surprise for
you.

377
00:31:14,700 --> 00:31:17,829
Okay, um, I have outfitted our
apartment

378
00:31:17,830 --> 00:31:20,039
for Halloween shenanigans,

379
00:31:20,040 --> 00:31:23,130
but I'm not gonna tell
you what I have planned.

380
00:31:26,920 --> 00:31:27,920
Jeremy?

381
00:31:30,380 --> 00:31:35,219
Please don't do this to me
again.

382
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:37,060
I'll be there, wait,

383
00:31:38,310 --> 00:31:39,980
just one more, okay?

384
00:31:42,440 --> 00:31:43,440
Okay.

385
00:32:09,130 --> 00:32:10,460
Good evening.

386
00:32:15,680 --> 00:32:16,680
You didn't see me?

387
00:32:18,970 --> 00:32:20,889
I sneak up on people.

388
00:32:20,890 --> 00:32:22,520
I guess you can call it a skill.

389
00:32:23,850 --> 00:32:24,850
I guess you could.

390
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:28,400
Would you mind?

391
00:32:30,690 --> 00:32:31,690
What?

392
00:32:32,900 --> 00:32:35,109
Dinner got a little out of
hand.

393
00:32:35,110 --> 00:32:36,110
13 apples.

394
00:32:38,580 --> 00:32:39,659
I'm kidding.

395
00:32:39,660 --> 00:32:40,700
It's stained blood.

396
00:32:42,710 --> 00:32:43,960
Or is it?

397
00:32:49,630 --> 00:32:51,089
It is.

398
00:32:51,090 --> 00:32:53,009
I didn't have time to wash up.

399
00:32:53,010 --> 00:32:54,679
I'm running late, I've already
gotten it

400
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:55,680
all over my phone.

401
00:32:56,590 --> 00:32:57,590
Would you mind?

402
00:33:10,780 --> 00:33:11,780
Much appreciated.

403
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:49,940
Pardon.

404
00:33:53,730 --> 00:33:58,280
Aren't you curious as to why
my hands are blood soaked?

405
00:34:01,030 --> 00:34:02,830
Dracula was a blood sucker,
right?

406
00:34:04,040 --> 00:34:05,540
Part of the costume, I assume.

407
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:10,130
Being Dracula doesn't
necessitate bloody hands.

408
00:34:20,300 --> 00:34:23,969
Why do you got blood on your
hands?

409
00:34:23,970 --> 00:34:25,720
This little show that I was...

410
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:28,309
This little monster mash put on
by

411
00:34:28,310 --> 00:34:30,979
some actor friends and myself.

412
00:34:30,980 --> 00:34:32,859
Had all the classics.

413
00:34:32,860 --> 00:34:36,939
Frankenstein, his bride, The
Mummy,

414
00:34:36,940 --> 00:34:38,949
Creature from the Black Lagoon,

415
00:34:38,950 --> 00:34:42,070
and of course, yours truly.

416
00:34:44,290 --> 00:34:46,080
Sounds a little hokey.

417
00:34:48,330 --> 00:34:50,540
It was violent, actually.

418
00:34:51,630 --> 00:34:53,499
Absurdly so.

419
00:34:53,500 --> 00:34:54,880
Comically, even.

420
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:59,549
You see, the monsters in our
little play

421
00:34:59,550 --> 00:35:01,389
have formed a council,

422
00:35:01,390 --> 00:35:05,179
and the nature of our meeting
is to elect a president.

423
00:35:05,180 --> 00:35:08,930
Of course, all the creatures
throw their hats in.

424
00:35:10,270 --> 00:35:14,479
The entire things descends
into this wild brawl.

425
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,689
All the creatures fighting with
each other

426
00:35:16,690 --> 00:35:17,690
for the position.

427
00:35:18,570 --> 00:35:20,949
What a riot.

428
00:35:20,950 --> 00:35:21,950
Guess who won?

429
00:35:23,820 --> 00:35:25,119
Hey, Howard?

430
00:35:25,120 --> 00:35:26,449
Yeah?

431
00:35:26,450 --> 00:35:28,120
Do you mind sitting back a
tad?

432
00:35:33,080 --> 00:35:34,130
For your safety.

433
00:35:37,050 --> 00:35:38,050
It was The Mummy.

434
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:40,670
You can't kill what's already
dead.

435
00:35:44,510 --> 00:35:47,009
Dracula's already dead, isn't
he?

436
00:35:47,010 --> 00:35:49,179
Still feasts on the living.

437
00:35:49,180 --> 00:35:50,560
More alive than The Mummy.

438
00:36:01,700 --> 00:36:03,780
You ever been in a wreck?

439
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,529
What's that?

440
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:07,949
A car wreck.

441
00:36:07,950 --> 00:36:10,159
If you were to swerve
off the road right now

442
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:11,789
and hit a light pole,

443
00:36:11,790 --> 00:36:14,420
I'd probably be ejected
through the front windshield.

444
00:36:15,330 --> 00:36:17,959
Happened to a friend of mine in
college.

445
00:36:17,960 --> 00:36:19,210
Walked away unscathed.

446
00:36:20,420 --> 00:36:22,220
But the driver, on the other
hand...

447
00:36:25,890 --> 00:36:27,850
I don't plan on having any
accidents.

448
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,890
I didn't say anything about an
accident.

449
00:36:35,100 --> 00:36:36,360
Careful.

450
00:36:41,570 --> 00:36:42,570
He wanted to.

451
00:36:43,490 --> 00:36:44,739
What?

452
00:36:44,740 --> 00:36:46,869
My friend.

453
00:36:46,870 --> 00:36:47,870
He wanted to what?

454
00:36:48,780 --> 00:36:50,159
Wreck.

455
00:36:50,160 --> 00:36:51,789
He grabbed the car and twisted
the wheel

456
00:36:51,790 --> 00:36:53,160
so it ran off the road.

457
00:36:55,000 --> 00:36:56,250
What a waste.

458
00:36:58,210 --> 00:36:59,380
Did you say something?

459
00:37:00,840 --> 00:37:01,920
He wanted out.

460
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,760
Instead, he sent his friend on.

461
00:37:19,310 --> 00:37:21,569
You get that, don't you?

462
00:37:21,570 --> 00:37:22,860
The death drive feeling.

463
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:25,320
Sure.

464
00:37:25,321 --> 00:37:26,779
Everybody does.

465
00:37:26,780 --> 00:37:28,950
If I'm staying near a
ledge, or by a train.

466
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:33,620
Everybody does, why is that?

467
00:37:34,460 --> 00:37:36,669
This species has a destructive
instinct

468
00:37:36,670 --> 00:37:39,630
that extends to even their own
survival.

469
00:37:40,710 --> 00:37:41,960
What do you make of that?

470
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:47,009
I don't.

471
00:37:47,010 --> 00:37:48,010
Hm.

472
00:37:51,430 --> 00:37:54,180
Of course, suicide is different.

473
00:37:57,140 --> 00:37:58,140
What is that?

474
00:37:59,150 --> 00:38:00,479
Pardon?

475
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,519
Are you eating in my car?

476
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:03,070
Do you see any food?

477
00:38:04,190 --> 00:38:05,239
Why are you doing that?

478
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:06,240
Doing what?

479
00:38:06,950 --> 00:38:08,449
The ventriloquism act,
speaking,

480
00:38:08,450 --> 00:38:09,569
without moving your mouth.

481
00:38:09,570 --> 00:38:11,779
Are you impressed?

482
00:38:11,780 --> 00:38:14,289
No, it's unnerving.

483
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:17,160
I guess you
can call it another skill.

484
00:38:22,250 --> 00:38:23,629
You all right?

485
00:38:23,630 --> 00:38:25,130
You're leaking.

486
00:38:26,470 --> 00:38:29,179
Just part of the process.

487
00:38:29,180 --> 00:38:30,339
What?

488
00:38:30,340 --> 00:38:32,470
I'm dying, Jeremy.

489
00:38:37,020 --> 00:38:39,940
But for me, it's more like
molting.

490
00:38:40,900 --> 00:38:43,070
So long as I secure a new
vessel.

491
00:38:44,360 --> 00:38:45,899
Stop that.

492
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:47,569
Stop what?

493
00:38:47,570 --> 00:38:49,989
Speaking with your mouth
closed.

494
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:50,990
Why?

495
00:38:51,780 --> 00:38:53,239
Visiting my head.

496
00:38:53,240 --> 00:38:54,789
I don't like it.

497
00:38:54,790 --> 00:38:56,249
What's in your head

498
00:38:56,250 --> 00:38:57,790
that you won't accept visitors?

499
00:39:00,370 --> 00:39:01,789
Where are we?

500
00:39:01,790 --> 00:39:03,999
Be at ease.

501
00:39:04,000 --> 00:39:05,340
Let me in.

502
00:39:06,880 --> 00:39:08,129
I'm so tired.

503
00:39:08,130 --> 00:39:09,130
Of what?

504
00:39:10,220 --> 00:39:11,429
What was that you were going
on about?

505
00:39:11,430 --> 00:39:12,430
Molting?

506
00:39:12,431 --> 00:39:15,140
We're not on
the road anymore, Jeremy.

507
00:39:18,560 --> 00:39:19,520
Where are we?

508
00:39:19,521 --> 00:39:20,889
In your mind.

509
00:39:20,890 --> 00:39:21,890
Sickening.

510
00:39:26,150 --> 00:39:27,649
Am I sleeping?

511
00:39:27,650 --> 00:39:28,650
No.

512
00:39:34,240 --> 00:39:35,779
Who are you?

513
00:39:35,780 --> 00:39:37,199
What I am is
less important to you

514
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,450
than where I'm going.

515
00:39:40,540 --> 00:39:43,289
Where I'm from is a distant
place,

516
00:39:43,290 --> 00:39:45,789
far in space and time.

517
00:39:45,790 --> 00:39:48,339
The bright swell of light
from my home's demise

518
00:39:48,340 --> 00:39:49,799
thousands of years ago

519
00:39:49,800 --> 00:39:52,889
is only now reaching Earth.

520
00:39:52,890 --> 00:39:54,010
But I don't mourn.

521
00:39:54,890 --> 00:39:58,139
I make new homes everywhere I
go.

522
00:39:58,140 --> 00:39:59,770
I'm in very many places now.

523
00:40:00,600 --> 00:40:05,270
I've come so far, yet where
I'm going next is very close.

524
00:40:16,240 --> 00:40:17,949
You're gonna kill me.

525
00:40:17,950 --> 00:40:21,119
We don't kill, we inhabit.

526
00:40:21,120 --> 00:40:22,999
Think of a flooded river

527
00:40:23,000 --> 00:40:25,579
rising towards a puddle along
its bank.

528
00:40:25,580 --> 00:40:27,790
When they meet, the
puddle no longer exists,

529
00:40:28,670 --> 00:40:29,800
but it's absorbed.

530
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:35,839
You're gonna make me like you.

531
00:40:35,840 --> 00:40:37,549
We have to propagate.

532
00:40:37,550 --> 00:40:39,850
This body has grown weak for our
means.

533
00:40:43,890 --> 00:40:45,649
You don't want me.

534
00:40:45,650 --> 00:40:46,650
I'm useless.

535
00:40:47,690 --> 00:40:49,230
Quit thinking of yourself.

536
00:40:50,480 --> 00:40:53,859
You would waste flesh, a body,

537
00:40:53,860 --> 00:40:54,990
brewing with potential.

538
00:40:59,160 --> 00:41:00,739
Give it to us.

539
00:41:00,740 --> 00:41:02,749
We would appreciate your gift,

540
00:41:02,750 --> 00:41:04,920
as we as Howards, and as
friends.

541
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:08,249
I'm using it.

542
00:41:08,250 --> 00:41:09,460
You're tired.

543
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,299
You don't know what I am.

544
00:41:13,300 --> 00:41:15,129
We're already inside you.

545
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:16,800
Among your thoughts and desires.

546
00:41:17,840 --> 00:41:19,429
You can't lie.

547
00:41:19,430 --> 00:41:21,470
We see everything.

548
00:41:22,680 --> 00:41:24,560
What kept you from following
through?

549
00:41:28,360 --> 00:41:29,360
Am I dead?

550
00:41:31,360 --> 00:41:32,989
Did I fall asleep?

551
00:41:32,990 --> 00:41:34,239
Crash?

552
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:35,610
Do you want to be dead?

553
00:41:39,570 --> 00:41:41,079
I don't know.

554
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:44,789
Indecision plagues
you, life torments you,

555
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:48,290
cede it to us, until it stops.

556
00:41:49,460 --> 00:41:50,999
You're cowardly.

557
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:53,380
Incapable of dealing with your
own issues.

558
00:41:56,010 --> 00:41:57,630
We'll do all the work.

559
00:42:11,060 --> 00:42:12,060
Hello?

560
00:42:14,940 --> 00:42:16,150
Howard?

561
00:42:30,080 --> 00:42:32,879
This isn't your dream.

562
00:42:32,880 --> 00:42:33,880
It could be.

563
00:42:34,920 --> 00:42:37,340
Until then, this is my space.

564
00:42:38,380 --> 00:42:40,890
Same as I am in your thoughts.

565
00:42:42,180 --> 00:42:44,260
I'll share mine with you.

566
00:42:45,720 --> 00:42:48,310
You understand my proposal now.

567
00:42:54,610 --> 00:42:56,069
I can't.

568
00:42:56,070 --> 00:42:57,149
There are people...

569
00:42:57,150 --> 00:42:58,990
There is one hurdle.

570
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:02,699
Do you have to see anybody?

571
00:43:02,700 --> 00:43:04,030
We'll save love.

572
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:07,289
You can?

573
00:43:07,290 --> 00:43:10,750
It will be her choice,
as it is yours now,

574
00:43:11,710 --> 00:43:12,790
but make it fast.

575
00:43:13,790 --> 00:43:14,790
We're fading.

576
00:43:16,210 --> 00:43:18,300
Soon we'll leave you to yourself
again.

577
00:43:19,930 --> 00:43:21,260
Once you say it.

578
00:43:39,610 --> 00:43:43,239
Welcome to your Halloween
haven.

579
00:43:43,240 --> 00:43:45,490
Complete with witchy company.

580
00:43:48,040 --> 00:43:49,040
Jeremy?

581
00:43:54,330 --> 00:43:57,129
Jesus, for a second I
thought it wasn't you.

582
00:43:57,130 --> 00:43:59,010
Sorry, I'm just beat.

583
00:44:00,550 --> 00:44:01,550
Look at me?

584
00:44:03,680 --> 00:44:04,680
Come on.

585
00:44:05,890 --> 00:44:08,010
Where we're here, it's just the
two of us.

586
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:13,270
I'd like it if you tried.

587
00:44:16,360 --> 00:44:18,569
Just a really long day.

588
00:44:18,570 --> 00:44:19,820
A strange ride.

589
00:44:21,320 --> 00:44:22,859
Forget it.

590
00:44:22,860 --> 00:44:23,860
It never happened.

591
00:44:27,530 --> 00:44:28,530
Jesus, Jeremy.

592
00:44:29,330 --> 00:44:30,330
Pardon.

593
00:44:32,710 --> 00:44:33,790
What is that?

594
00:44:35,130 --> 00:44:36,130
A bit of residue.

595
00:44:36,920 --> 00:44:39,210
And what have you been eating?

596
00:44:40,340 --> 00:44:42,670
It's the other way around.

597
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:47,140
Are you pulling a
Halloween prank on me, babe?

598
00:44:48,810 --> 00:44:50,680
Something like that.

599
00:45:04,910 --> 00:45:06,070
You're cold.

600
00:45:09,280 --> 00:45:11,120
Something's not right about you.

601
00:45:12,120 --> 00:45:13,959
Jeremy took an out,

602
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:15,500
decided to gift us this vessel.

603
00:45:16,830 --> 00:45:19,749
It's not quite your worst fear,
sweetie,

604
00:45:19,750 --> 00:45:21,170
but it's adjacent.

605
00:45:22,340 --> 00:45:24,009
Jeremy left you with a pair of
words

606
00:45:24,010 --> 00:45:26,050
scrawled in chicken scratch on
the page.

607
00:45:32,470 --> 00:45:33,470
I'm so sorry.

608
00:45:40,900 --> 00:45:42,070
What happened to you?

609
00:45:44,950 --> 00:45:47,110
Visitor granted him his wish.

610
00:45:49,160 --> 00:45:50,330
He wouldn't.

611
00:45:52,660 --> 00:45:54,829
He wouldn't, he wouldn't...

612
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:56,409
I can already
see into your thoughts,

613
00:45:56,410 --> 00:45:57,540
you know that's untrue.

614
00:45:58,830 --> 00:46:01,000
Peer in the mind and find
solace.

615
00:46:04,170 --> 00:46:06,590
You're an imposter.

616
00:46:08,510 --> 00:46:10,719
He was an imposter.

617
00:46:10,720 --> 00:46:12,810
This is far more genuine.

618
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:16,940
Where'd you go?

619
00:46:19,730 --> 00:46:23,150
It's only us in here, Whitney.

620
00:46:25,940 --> 00:46:27,700
You need help.

621
00:47:10,570 --> 00:47:12,820
Attention, you must be...

622
00:47:21,040 --> 00:47:23,209
Should I show you what
happened to me?

623
00:47:23,210 --> 00:47:24,630
Your grief compels you.

624
00:47:26,630 --> 00:47:27,630
Jeremy is gone.

625
00:47:28,800 --> 00:47:31,339
His body won't inhabit
the same space as before,

626
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:33,930
only helmed by foreign evidence.

627
00:47:35,560 --> 00:47:37,970
This beats seeing him every day.

628
00:47:38,930 --> 00:47:40,980
Perhaps pretending you're
together still.

629
00:47:42,310 --> 00:47:47,320
But it'll be us, until
this vessel's spent.

630
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:52,160
For us, another chapter.

631
00:47:53,110 --> 00:47:56,160
For you, personal remade flesh.

632
00:47:58,790 --> 00:48:00,749
No reason to like this thing.

633
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:03,630
Holding onto it like hauling
dead epoch.

634
00:48:08,050 --> 00:48:09,510
Will you let me touch him?

635
00:48:11,930 --> 00:48:12,930
Hold him?

636
00:48:14,840 --> 00:48:15,840
Kiss him?

637
00:48:17,310 --> 00:48:19,519
Sleep with him?

638
00:48:19,520 --> 00:48:23,309
And know that every
time you touch this body,

639
00:48:23,310 --> 00:48:25,310
you're being intimate with a
dead thing.

640
00:48:27,980 --> 00:48:28,980
We're in your mind.

641
00:48:30,110 --> 00:48:31,359
We see how you carried him

642
00:48:31,360 --> 00:48:33,859
when he was already half dead
before,

643
00:48:33,860 --> 00:48:35,949
resigned to give in.

644
00:48:35,950 --> 00:48:38,540
We could've shared our death
card

645
00:48:39,490 --> 00:48:41,250
if you thought of me.

646
00:48:46,460 --> 00:48:47,460
Did it hurt?

647
00:49:26,460 --> 00:49:28,420
Trick or treat!

648
00:49:33,050 --> 00:49:34,380

All right.

677
00:51:13,860 --> 00:51:15,399
Get the rest of the stuff,

678
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,649
I'm gonna set up so we'll
be all ready to pop!

679
00:51:17,650 --> 00:51:18,899
Oh, you ain't lying, baby.

680
00:51:18,900 --> 00:51:21,989
This will be the best God
damn Halloween party ever.

681
00:51:21,990 --> 00:51:23,319
Ever!

682
00:51:23,320 --> 00:51:24,580
Rein it in, honey!

683
00:51:34,460 --> 00:51:37,009
Man, this place is creepy as
hell!

684
00:51:37,010 --> 00:51:39,009
Where's all the dry ice

685
00:51:39,010 --> 00:51:40,879
and the Jack-O-Lanterns and
shit?

686
00:51:40,880 --> 00:51:43,850
You're two hours early, Abe.

687
00:51:45,350 --> 00:51:46,599
Ah, nevermind.

688
00:51:46,600 --> 00:51:48,099
I'm here to help.

689
00:51:48,100 --> 00:51:49,979
Fuck, I'm excited.

690
00:51:49,980 --> 00:51:53,439
I'm ready to pound some
beers, roast some mallows,

691
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:54,859
and smoke some weed.

692
00:51:54,860 --> 00:51:56,900
Let's get this God damn bonfire
lit.

693
00:51:59,150 --> 00:52:00,150
Rein it in, dude.

694
00:52:12,620 --> 00:52:15,079
Guys, guys, guys, guys.

695
00:52:15,080 --> 00:52:16,999
Who wants to hear a scary story?

696
00:52:17,000 --> 00:52:18,549
Yeah!

697
00:52:18,550 --> 00:52:19,550
All right.

698
00:52:19,551 --> 00:52:23,379
So, hundreds and hundreds of
years ago

699
00:52:23,380 --> 00:52:27,100
in Indian times, feather, not
red dot,

700
00:52:28,390 --> 00:52:32,230
this land here, ancient burial
ground.

701
00:52:33,140 --> 00:52:34,729
All right?

702
00:52:34,730 --> 00:52:38,479
Scared place, and these
spirits came out of it,

703
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,569
and the blah, blah, blah,

704
00:52:40,570 --> 00:52:43,949
these people were killed, and
murdered.

705
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:48,030
This is a horrible fucking
ghost story.

706
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:49,870
All right, all right,

707
00:52:49,871 --> 00:52:51,909
so there was a burial ground,

708
00:52:51,910 --> 00:52:53,160
and people were murdered.

709
00:52:54,460 --> 00:52:57,089
But it didn't happen 200 years
ago.

710
00:52:57,090 --> 00:53:00,960
It happened one year ago
tonight.

711
00:53:02,050 --> 00:53:04,469
So there's a group of college
co-eds,

712
00:53:04,470 --> 00:53:06,969
and they went camping in the
woods,

713
00:53:06,970 --> 00:53:09,349
and they came upon a sacred
site.

714
00:53:09,350 --> 00:53:11,809
You know, they could feel it in
the air.

715
00:53:11,810 --> 00:53:13,599
And there was a totem

716
00:53:13,600 --> 00:53:16,769
of the Apache revenge spirits.

717
00:53:16,770 --> 00:53:18,020
Kanama, they called it.

718
00:53:19,190 --> 00:53:21,109
Anyway, so they started fooling
around,

719
00:53:21,110 --> 00:53:21,990
and they were looking at all

720
00:53:21,991 --> 00:53:24,069
these arrowheads and everything,

721
00:53:24,070 --> 00:53:26,409
and that's when they saw it.

722
00:53:26,410 --> 00:53:27,530
It was a hatchet!

723
00:53:28,660 --> 00:53:29,660
Tomahawk.

724
00:53:29,661 --> 00:53:31,039
Yeah, tomahawk, yeah.

725
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,040
A hatchet!

726
00:53:35,370 --> 00:53:36,210
Holy shit!

727
00:53:36,211 --> 00:53:37,829
She's just freaking out out
there!

728
00:53:37,830 --> 00:53:38,919
The phone, the phone!

729
00:53:38,920 --> 00:53:41,629
Where's the fucking phone?

730
00:53:41,630 --> 00:53:43,799
There's no fucking phone in
the cabin!

731
00:53:43,800 --> 00:53:45,049
I say we just let her lie there,

732
00:53:45,050 --> 00:53:46,470
and then she can sleep it off.

733
00:53:47,760 --> 00:53:49,549
He'll kill us all!

734
00:53:49,550 --> 00:53:51,219
Nobody's safe!

735
00:53:51,220 --> 00:53:53,849
We desecrated his ancestors!

736
00:53:53,850 --> 00:53:56,019
Killed them all!

737
00:53:56,020 --> 00:53:57,690
Rein in it, woman!

738
00:53:58,810 --> 00:53:59,980
Tell us what happened.

739
00:54:01,110 --> 00:54:03,150
Calm down, what is your name?

740
00:54:04,860 --> 00:54:07,320
My name is Sugar Crawford.

741
00:54:09,240 --> 00:54:13,949
We were out, I was
assisting Dr. Julius Zyrk

742
00:54:13,950 --> 00:54:15,290
and his research.

743
00:54:22,380 --> 00:54:23,380
Nancy!

744
00:55:52,090 --> 00:55:53,090
I'm all out!

745
00:55:54,010 --> 00:55:55,469
You got anymore?

746
00:55:55,470 --> 00:55:56,969
I still have one egg left.

747
00:55:56,970 --> 00:55:58,179
So what are you waiting for,
man?

748
00:55:58,180 --> 00:55:59,639
Let 'er rip.

749
00:55:59,640 --> 00:56:01,559
Well, I see their TV on
inside.

750
00:56:01,560 --> 00:56:03,190
There might be people in there.

751
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,609
So?

752
00:56:05,610 --> 00:56:07,019
So, what do you mean?

753
00:56:07,020 --> 00:56:08,819
What happens if they see us?

754
00:56:08,820 --> 00:56:10,440
I hope they see us.

755
00:56:11,530 --> 00:56:13,489
I don't want to get in anymore
trouble.

756
00:56:13,490 --> 00:56:16,079
Besides, what happens if they're
just cool

757
00:56:16,080 --> 00:56:17,620
and they just ran out of candy?

758
00:56:19,790 --> 00:56:22,959
Look, we're not the bed
guys in this scenario.

759
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:24,499
We're the heroes.

760
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:25,330
Huh?

761
00:56:25,331 --> 00:56:27,709
We're out here on Halloween
night risking our asses

762
00:56:27,710 --> 00:56:29,379
to protect tradition.

763
00:56:29,380 --> 00:56:31,049
These assholes know the rule.

764
00:56:31,050 --> 00:56:33,009
They've been on the
other side of the door.

765
00:56:33,010 --> 00:56:34,679
It's Trick or Treat.

766
00:56:34,680 --> 00:56:37,049
Trick or Treat.

767
00:56:37,050 --> 00:56:38,349
One simple rule.

768
00:56:38,350 --> 00:56:40,349
And do you see any treats?

769
00:56:40,350 --> 00:56:41,180
No.

770
00:56:41,181 --> 00:56:43,309
It's our duty as the kids of
Halloween

771
00:56:43,310 --> 00:56:45,349
to remind them of the rules

772
00:56:45,350 --> 00:56:47,859
that they appear to have
forgotten.

773
00:56:47,860 --> 00:56:50,110
So, are you ready to do your
part?

774
00:56:51,820 --> 00:56:53,700
Just give me the God damn egg!

775
00:56:54,820 --> 00:56:57,280
Get up there and ring the
doorbell, Jesus.

776
00:57:06,830 --> 00:57:07,999
Wait, what?

777
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:09,549
Where you goin'?

778
00:57:09,550 --> 00:57:10,550
Pussy!

779
00:57:13,510 --> 00:57:14,510
Trick or treat.

780
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:19,969
Oh, you little shit.

781
00:57:19,970 --> 00:57:20,970
You better run!

782
00:57:39,370 --> 00:57:40,869
Babe, what the fuck.

783
00:57:40,870 --> 00:57:42,539
Did you not hear any of that?

784
00:57:42,540 --> 00:57:43,789
Hear what?

785
00:57:43,790 --> 00:57:46,169
Um, the sound of a
psychotic hooligan kid

786
00:57:46,170 --> 00:57:47,879
attacking me with an egg

787
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:49,459
at the front door.

788
00:57:49,460 --> 00:57:50,290
Ha!

789
00:57:50,291 --> 00:57:51,709
Told you when you were
making that little sign

790
00:57:51,710 --> 00:57:53,259
that there are rules on
Halloween.

791
00:57:53,260 --> 00:57:54,260
What?

792
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:57,550
They're probably just
enforcing the rules.

793
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:03,099
This is a 20 dollar hazy.

794
00:58:03,100 --> 00:58:04,389
Are you kidding me?

795
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:06,849
I'm getting attacked
by Children of the Corn

796
00:58:06,850 --> 00:58:09,229
and you're worried about your
beer?

797
00:58:09,230 --> 00:58:10,609
Aren't you gonna do something
about it?

798
00:58:10,610 --> 00:58:13,609
Chase them down, kick some ass
for me?

799
00:58:13,610 --> 00:58:14,610
Anything?

800
00:58:15,990 --> 00:58:16,950
Babe.

801
00:58:16,951 --> 00:58:18,529
I got you.

802
00:58:18,530 --> 00:58:19,910
I'm your ride or die.

803
00:58:20,910 --> 00:58:22,199
If anything, though, I should
probably

804
00:58:22,200 --> 00:58:23,739
be thanking those kids.

805
00:58:23,740 --> 00:58:24,580
Asshole!

806
00:58:24,581 --> 00:58:27,459
Because, if it wasn't for
them,

807
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:30,129
then I wouldn't have this hot,
naked ass

808
00:58:30,130 --> 00:58:31,289
right in front of me,

809
00:58:31,290 --> 00:58:32,840
begging to be worshiped.

810
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:34,760
True.

811
00:58:34,760 --> 00:58:35,590
Nice recovery.

812
00:58:35,591 --> 00:58:37,129
But you're still an asshole.

813
00:58:37,130 --> 00:58:38,880
I have to get ready for this
party.

814
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:41,259
Come on, how about just a
quickie.

815
00:58:41,260 --> 00:58:42,849
Otherwise I'm gonna have
this boner all night

816
00:58:42,850 --> 00:58:43,760
just thinking about it,

817
00:58:43,761 --> 00:58:46,349
and you know these shorts
aren't gonna cover it.

818
00:58:46,350 --> 00:58:47,439
I'll tell you what.

819
00:58:47,440 --> 00:58:49,229
You go clean the egg off the
door,

820
00:58:49,230 --> 00:58:51,769
then maybe we can play one more
round of

821
00:58:51,770 --> 00:58:54,189
Naughty Camper, Horny Counselor.

822
00:58:54,190 --> 00:58:55,229
Maybe.

823
00:58:55,230 --> 00:58:57,949
I am gonna clean the
shit out of that door,

824
00:58:57,950 --> 00:59:01,780
and then I am gonna counsel
the fuck out of you.

825
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:06,370
Oh, God, thank you.

826
00:59:12,670 --> 00:59:14,420
God damn, I love Halloween.

827
00:59:21,300 --> 00:59:23,220
Oh, fucking shit, dude.

828
00:59:24,220 --> 00:59:25,220
Bro.

829
00:59:28,390 --> 00:59:29,479
Are you one of those
guys that threw the eggs

830
00:59:29,480 --> 00:59:30,480
at my girl?

831
00:59:31,770 --> 00:59:33,309
I mean, it's okay, I get it.

832
00:59:33,310 --> 00:59:35,359
It's Halloween, whatever.

833
00:59:35,360 --> 00:59:37,650
Plus, kind of a big guy.

834
00:59:38,530 --> 00:59:40,030
What are you like, 250, 260?

835
00:59:42,780 --> 00:59:43,700
Okay then.

836
00:59:43,701 --> 00:59:45,949
Well, as you can see, we are

837
00:59:45,950 --> 00:59:47,789
"Sorry kids, no candy."

838
00:59:47,790 --> 00:59:50,370
That means we are closed for the
night.

839
00:59:51,460 --> 00:59:52,460
All right.

840
00:59:56,420 --> 00:59:57,250
Seriously, bro.

841
00:59:57,251 --> 00:59:58,799
Get the fuck outta here.

842
00:59:58,800 --> 01:00:00,049
I've got some pumpkins to smash,

843
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:01,050
if you know what I mean.

844
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:05,049
Seriously bro, get the fuck
outta here,

845
01:00:05,050 --> 01:00:06,510
you're starting to piss me off.

846
01:00:31,540 --> 01:00:33,080
Hotter than a campfire.

847
01:00:38,090 --> 01:00:39,339
Babe.

848
01:00:39,340 --> 01:00:41,010
We don't have time to play
games.

849
01:00:44,140 --> 01:00:45,929
Seriously, we gotta go.

850
01:00:45,930 --> 01:00:46,890
Can I just blow you in the car

851
01:00:46,891 --> 01:00:48,100
on the way to the party?

852
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:51,019
Hey, dickhead.

853
01:00:51,020 --> 01:00:52,229
My offer's about to get reduced

854
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:54,440
to hand job in a second.

855
01:00:56,110 --> 01:00:57,440
What are you doing?

856
01:01:56,420 --> 01:01:57,420
Bye.

857
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:59,670
Trick or treat.

858
01:02:00,710 --> 01:02:01,999
Aren't you a little too old

859
01:02:02,000 --> 01:02:03,759
to be trick or treating still?

860
01:02:03,760 --> 01:02:04,590
Duh.

861
01:02:04,590 --> 01:02:05,550
And aren't you a little too hot

862
01:02:05,551 --> 01:02:08,139
to be all alone on Halloween?

863
01:02:08,140 --> 01:02:10,509
As a matter of fact, I'm not
alone.

864
01:02:10,510 --> 01:02:12,519
I'm babysitting an adorable
little girl

865
01:02:12,520 --> 01:02:14,929
who's sleeping in her room right
now,

866
01:02:14,930 --> 01:02:17,899
and in about an hour,
when her parents get home,

867
01:02:17,900 --> 01:02:20,059
I'm heading straight to a
Halloween party

868
01:02:20,060 --> 01:02:21,860
where I'm meeting my boyfriend.

869
01:02:22,690 --> 01:02:24,069
So what you're saying is that

870
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:25,440
we have an hour to kill.

871
01:02:26,280 --> 01:02:27,819
I don't think so, kid.

872
01:02:27,820 --> 01:02:29,819
Look, you're pretty cute,

873
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:32,029
and you already have that
perfect mixture

874
01:02:32,030 --> 01:02:34,249
of confidence and asshole that
just, ugh,

875
01:02:34,250 --> 01:02:36,209
really drive the girls wild,

876
01:02:36,210 --> 01:02:38,579
but you're too young for me,

877
01:02:38,580 --> 01:02:41,379
and like I said, I already got a
man.

878
01:02:41,380 --> 01:02:42,210
Whatever.

879
01:02:42,211 --> 01:02:44,419
There's plenty of sexy nurses in
the sea.

880
01:02:44,420 --> 01:02:46,419
And anyways, now that
I know where you live,

881
01:02:46,420 --> 01:02:48,720
I have a feeling I'll
be seeing you very soon.

882
01:02:49,930 --> 01:02:52,009
I don't live here, just
babysitting.

883
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:53,010
Remember?

884
01:03:04,480 --> 01:03:06,400
Don't waste your time, she's a
prude.

885
01:03:12,620 --> 01:03:13,949
Are you at the party yet?

886
01:03:13,950 --> 01:03:15,199
Have you seen Brad?

887
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:16,200
What's he wearing?

888
01:03:16,201 --> 01:03:17,829
Is it the doctor costume like I
said?

889
01:03:17,830 --> 01:03:20,169
Jesus, chill out.

890
01:03:20,170 --> 01:03:21,080
What?

891
01:03:21,081 --> 01:03:23,039
You sound like a stalker!

892
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:23,960
No.

893
01:03:23,961 --> 01:03:26,169
I just want to make sure he's
there,

894
01:03:26,170 --> 01:03:27,589
and he's having fun.

895
01:03:27,590 --> 01:03:29,509
Not too much fun.

896
01:03:29,510 --> 01:03:31,929
Because then I'll have
to cut his balls off

897
01:03:31,930 --> 01:03:33,849
with a pair of toenail clippers.

898
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:34,680
Gross.

899
01:03:34,681 --> 01:03:36,599
I don't think that's even
possible.

900
01:03:36,600 --> 01:03:37,809
It is.

901
01:03:37,810 --> 01:03:39,849
Well, it would take forever.

902
01:03:39,850 --> 01:03:41,309
When the hell are you
gonna get to the party?

903
01:03:41,310 --> 01:03:43,189
Ugh, as soon as this little
shit's

904
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:44,689
weird ass parents get here.

905
01:03:44,690 --> 01:03:47,279
They said by midnight,
but hopefully sooner.

906
01:03:47,280 --> 01:03:49,819
Ugh, they're old, and boring,

907
01:03:49,820 --> 01:03:51,780
and should be in bed already,
and...

908
01:03:55,910 --> 01:03:57,409
Nevermind.

909
01:03:57,410 --> 01:03:59,199
Maybe they aren't as boring as I
thought.

910
01:03:59,200 --> 01:04:01,420
Wait, what
are you talking about?

911
01:04:02,330 --> 01:04:03,629
Nothing.

912
01:04:03,630 --> 01:04:07,419
I just found a drawer
full of sex toys and weed.

913
01:04:07,420 --> 01:04:10,049
Uh, are you serious?

914
01:04:10,050 --> 01:04:11,129
Oh, yeah.

915
01:04:11,130 --> 01:04:13,219
I'm about to start my pregame,
bitch.

916
01:04:13,220 --> 01:04:14,220
See you later.

917
01:04:20,180 --> 01:04:23,019
Why, hello there little fella.

918
01:04:23,020 --> 01:04:24,940
Let's see what you have up your
sleeve.

919
01:04:30,320 --> 01:04:31,449
Oh, yeah.

920
01:04:31,450 --> 01:04:33,739
You and I are gonna be great
friends.

921
01:04:33,740 --> 01:04:35,070
I can tell already.

922
01:05:09,940 --> 01:05:10,780
No, no, no.

923

You're a big son of a bitch,
aren't you?

928
01:05:25,710 --> 01:05:26,710
I don't care.

929
01:05:28,920 --> 01:05:30,839
I saw her first!

930
01:05:30,840 --> 01:05:32,209
I got here first!

931
01:05:32,210 --> 01:05:33,210
I am first.

932
01:05:34,130 --> 01:05:35,339

I don't know what you think
you know,

01:05:42,100 --> 01:05:43,979
but you're wrong.

936
01:05:43,980 --> 01:05:44,980
She's mine.

937
01:05:46,060 --> 01:05:48,400
I have been watching her for
weeks.

938
01:05:51,320 --> 01:05:52,320
All right.

939
01:05:52,321 --> 01:05:55,029
Maybe not weeks, but days.

940

Days, and days, and days and...

941
01:05:59,870 --> 01:06:01,029
God damn it.

942
01:06:01,030 --> 01:06:02,039
Fine!

943
01:06:02,040 --> 01:06:02,870
A day, okay?

944
01:06:02,871 --> 01:06:04,289
One day.

945
01:06:04,290 --> 01:06:06,500
You happy now, you nosy son of a
bitch!

946
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:10,879
But it was a whole day.

947
01:06:10,880 --> 01:06:13,210
An entire day, today, but all
day today.

948
01:06:14,760 --> 01:06:15,840
Since it got dark out.

949
01:06:17,260 --> 01:06:20,600
But that's still longer than
you.

950
01:06:23,680 --> 01:06:25,179
You don't put any work into it,
man.

951
01:06:25,180 --> 01:06:28,440
You just show up, like you own
the place.

952
01:06:29,690 --> 01:06:31,729
But you don't, no.

953
01:06:31,730 --> 01:06:33,859

You're a tough guy, huh, yeah?

957
01:06:41,120 --> 01:06:42,120
A tough guy.

958
01:06:43,450 --> 01:06:44,370
You think you're better than me?

959
01:06:44,371 --> 01:06:46,330
Oh, well you're not.

960
01:06:47,370 --> 01:06:52,589
I am faster than you,
I am smarter than you,

961
01:06:52,590 --> 01:06:54,840
I am a hell of a lot
better looking than you,

962
01:06:56,090 --> 01:06:58,759
and I can outwit you so fast

963
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:01,390
that your gross, ugly head will
spin.

01:07:09,440 --> 01:07:10,440
Come on, man!

965
01:07:12,520 --> 01:07:14,230
I really need this.

966
01:07:16,240 --> 01:07:17,949
I have had a really bad week,

967
01:07:17,950 --> 01:07:19,609
and it's Halloween night,

968
01:07:19,610 --> 01:07:22,869
and she fits my profile
perfectly.

969
01:07:22,870 --> 01:07:25,240
That doesn't always happen.

970
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:30,039
You know how that is, right?

971
01:07:30,040 --> 01:07:32,880
I mean, you must have a type.

972
01:07:34,090 --> 01:07:36,210
Hockey player, or something?

973
01:07:39,550 --> 01:07:40,759
You're covered in blood already,

974
01:07:40,760 --> 01:07:42,139
you're like a rockstar.

975
01:07:42,140 --> 01:07:45,349
You have clearly had a
successful night.

976
01:07:45,350 --> 01:07:47,810
So why don't you just go back to

977
01:07:48,770 --> 01:07:49,849
wherever it is you come from,

978
01:07:49,850 --> 01:07:52,899
and put your big boots up,

979
01:07:52,900 --> 01:07:55,520
and you know, loosen up the
straps.

980
01:07:56,480 --> 01:07:59,399
Maybe sip a margarita, just
relax.

981
01:07:59,400 --> 01:08:00,569
Just get your energy back,

982
01:08:00,570 --> 01:08:03,450
and just take a break, okay?

983
01:08:04,830 --> 01:08:06,490
You deserve that, my friend.

984
01:08:16,250 --> 01:08:17,460
Beat it, freak show!

985
01:08:20,720 --> 01:08:22,379
God damn it.

986
01:08:22,380 --> 01:08:23,469
Do you know how long it takes me

987
01:08:23,470 --> 01:08:25,179
to get ready every night?

988
01:08:25,180 --> 01:08:26,850
Huh, do you?

989
01:08:27,720 --> 01:08:30,229
Well, whose fault is that?

990
01:08:30,230 --> 01:08:31,230
Huh?

991
01:08:32,140 --> 01:08:33,560
Son of a bitch!

992
01:08:35,610 --> 01:08:38,189
And besides, like I've
been saying all along,

993
01:08:38,190 --> 01:08:39,610
she is mine!

994
01:08:45,450 --> 01:08:46,450
Oh, shit.

995
01:08:48,950 --> 01:08:50,250
All right.

996
01:08:52,410 --> 01:08:55,289
Is that the best you've got?

997
01:08:55,290 --> 01:08:57,339
Oh, yeah, that's tight.

998
01:08:57,340 --> 01:08:59,920
Oh, yeah.

999
01:09:03,720 --> 01:09:05,430
You have very strong hands.

1000
01:09:07,390 --> 01:09:08,760
All right, all right.

1001
01:09:10,470 --> 01:09:12,939
All right, all right.

1002
01:09:12,940 --> 01:09:14,059
You can have her, I was just
kidding,

1003
01:09:14,060 --> 01:09:16,400
she's all yours, you win.

1004
01:09:17,810 --> 01:09:18,770
Ease up, man, all right?

1005
01:09:18,771 --> 01:09:21,610
Come on, your hand's
gotta be cramping by now.

1006
01:09:24,610 --> 01:09:25,739
Hey.

1007
01:09:25,740 --> 01:09:26,869
Hey, look.

1008
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:28,079
That guy.

1009
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,870
He's trying to steal your girl.

1010
01:09:46,390 --> 01:09:48,220
God damn satanic worshipers.

1011
01:09:49,350 --> 01:09:50,760
They fuckin' ruin everything.

1012
01:09:51,680 --> 01:09:53,429
I hate them.

1013
01:09:53,430 --> 01:09:55,479
Well, all right.

1014
01:09:55,480 --> 01:09:57,979
Come on, big guy.

1015
01:09:57,980 --> 01:09:58,980
I heard there's a high school
party

1016
01:09:58,981 --> 01:10:00,520
just a couple blocks away.

1017
01:10:01,780 --> 01:10:03,650
We can go take out our anger on
them.

1018
01:10:13,700 --> 01:10:16,159
Well, I hope you're not in love,
kid.

1019
01:10:16,160 --> 01:10:18,670
Because she just lost her
head over somebody else.

1020
01:10:21,420 --> 01:10:23,460
What the hell is that supposed
to mean?

1021
01:10:25,170 --> 01:10:26,720
Hey, wait up!

1022
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:33,350
Do you guys know where
that high school party is?

1023
01:10:38,150 --> 01:10:40,520
Do you think there will be beer
there?

1024
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:45,150
Do you know what butt chugging
is?

1025
01:10:59,120 --> 01:11:00,289
Do forgive Peter's denial

1026
01:11:00,290 --> 01:11:02,339
and those who crucified you.

1027
01:11:02,340 --> 01:11:04,089
Count on my transgressions,

1028
01:11:04,090 --> 01:11:07,089
but rather my tears of
repentance.

1029
01:11:07,090 --> 01:11:11,510
Renew my iniquities, but
more especially, my sorrows.

1030
01:13:00,790 --> 01:13:02,120
I'm sorry, Papa.

1031
01:15:42,030 --> 01:15:43,700
Undo me!

1032
01:18:13,430 --> 01:18:15,020
Shit.

1033
01:18:32,240 --> 01:18:34,120
I think that would be a great
idea.

1034
01:18:41,790 --> 01:18:42,799
Nevermind that, Sister Mary.

1035
01:18:42,800 --> 01:18:44,210
Let's go.

1036
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:46,630
Aw, look at him, isn't he
cute?

1037
01:20:52,050 --> 01:20:53,470
Aw, there you go.

1038
01:21:26,420 --> 01:21:27,420
Stop!

1039
01:23:59,240 --> 01:24:00,240
I'm sorry.

1040
01:28:43,230 --> 01:28:46,649
Well, my victims, that's
all we have for tonight.

1041
01:28:46,650 --> 01:28:49,239
Another monster marathon
has come and gone.

1042
01:28:49,240 --> 01:28:51,989
Sadly, we'll have to wait
another year

1043
01:28:51,990 --> 01:28:53,740
for another terrifying time.

1044
01:28:56,330 --> 01:28:57,280
Oh.

1045
01:28:57,281 --> 01:28:59,870
Did you not get the
deadvite to the after party?

1046
01:29:01,160 --> 01:29:03,830
Well, it is for deceased members
only.

1047
01:29:05,750 --> 01:29:07,629
Well, if you do choose to go
out,

1048
01:29:07,630 --> 01:29:10,669
be careful of who may be
lurking around the corner.

1049
01:29:10,670 --> 01:29:14,549
You never know what may steal
the life from out of you.
