- Didn't come from here.

it, that he shows up,

00:28:24,270 --> 00:28:26,736
couple of 100 clicks apart.

354
00:28:27,272 --> 00:28:30,341
Something's in the air. Full moon?

355
00:28:30,342 --> 00:28:34,044
You think he's smart enough to
know our jurisdiction lines?

356
00:28:35,780 --> 00:28:37,849
You think this is
connected to Delia?

357
00:28:37,850 --> 00:28:39,851
Well, it's...

358
00:28:39,852 --> 00:28:43,655
A gruesome crime scene.
No forced entry.

359
00:28:43,656 --> 00:28:45,657
I don't think so.

360
00:28:45,658 --> 00:28:48,560
I mean, the victims
couldn't be more different.

361
00:28:48,561 --> 00:28:52,397
An old lady in town.
Rich guy on a farm.

362
00:28:52,398 --> 00:28:54,432
What's the connection?

363
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:58,636
His face looked pretty
weird, didn't it? Hmm?

364
00:28:58,637 --> 00:29:02,907
It could have been manipulated
but it wasn't so obvious.

365
00:29:02,908 --> 00:29:05,542
Would it show up in the autopsy?

366
00:29:07,245 --> 00:29:10,013
Not if he was wearing
gloves. Thank you.

367
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,551
You guys?

368
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:17,654
All right.

370
00:29:47,786 --> 00:29:52,457
Don't put your drink
on my photo album.

371
00:29:52,458 --> 00:29:56,359
You're gonna get a mark on it.

372
00:29:57,896 --> 00:29:59,597
Hmm.

373
00:29:59,598 --> 00:30:02,200
I haven't looked at
these in a long time.

374
00:30:02,201 --> 00:30:05,670
Oh, look at those false eyelashes.
Remember those?

375
00:30:05,671 --> 00:30:07,405
Yeah, they were ridiculous.

376
00:30:07,406 --> 00:30:10,175
Remember at your wedding
when you started laughing

377
00:30:10,176 --> 00:30:11,676
and you laughed so hard you cried

378
00:30:11,677 --> 00:30:14,512
and your eyelashes
slid down your cheek?

379
00:30:14,513 --> 00:30:17,182
I'm not the one that started
the laughing, you did.

380
00:30:17,183 --> 00:30:18,650
No, I didn't. I did... No.

381
00:30:18,651 --> 00:30:20,618
I was laughing because
you were laughing.

382
00:30:20,619 --> 00:30:25,023
You... Once you started
I had to join in.

383
00:30:25,024 --> 00:30:28,793
You have such an infectious laugh.

384
00:30:28,794 --> 00:30:31,963
You have a terrible memory.

385
00:30:31,964 --> 00:30:33,731
I don't have a terrible memory.

386
00:30:33,732 --> 00:30:36,166
That's exactly what happened.

387
00:30:37,702 --> 00:30:39,936
I miss that laugh.

388
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:51,581
Okay. Well, enjoy your corpses.

389
00:30:59,924 --> 00:31:02,026
Thank you. I was just calling
to see if there'd been

390
00:31:02,027 --> 00:31:04,694
any recent murders in
your jurisdiction.

391
00:31:05,163 --> 00:31:07,263
Uh, sure, I can hold.

392
00:31:07,498 --> 00:31:09,100
Who is that?

393
00:31:09,101 --> 00:31:11,936
Hamilton Police Department.

394
00:31:11,937 --> 00:31:14,804
They're not sure they've
had any murders?

395
00:31:15,006 --> 00:31:17,340
Yeah, I'm still here.

396
00:31:22,080 --> 00:31:25,316
MASON: Got your requisition
for more manpower.

397
00:31:25,317 --> 00:31:27,252
Didn't I send somebody to you?

398
00:31:27,253 --> 00:31:30,421
Yes, but we still only have
two detectives, me and Ray.

399
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:32,223
Well, that should be enough
to solve one murder.

400
00:31:32,224 --> 00:31:37,060
- Two. We think this is the work of a...
- Oh, good God.

401
00:31:37,262 --> 00:31:39,295
No, please. (CHUCKLES)

402
00:31:40,765 --> 00:31:42,100
Serial killer.

403
00:31:42,101 --> 00:31:43,534
Serial killer, huh?

404
00:31:43,535 --> 00:31:45,603
Do you know what we
call two murders here?

405
00:31:45,604 --> 00:31:47,372
The morning shift.

406
00:31:47,373 --> 00:31:49,406
You should do stand-up.

407
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:52,477
Oh, wait a second. This is
your way of convincing me

408
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:54,479
to give you the permanent
Commanding Officer job,

409
00:31:54,480 --> 00:31:57,482
with a suicide attempt
on your record.

410
00:31:57,483 --> 00:31:59,717
You lost your chance
when they had to pump

411
00:31:59,718 --> 00:32:02,819
painkillers out of
your belly in the ER.

412
00:32:06,324 --> 00:32:08,293
I'm telling you about two murders.

413
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:10,328
Do you think I give a
shit what my title is?

414
00:32:10,329 --> 00:32:13,897
You would have been forced into retirement
without me, so watch your mouth.

415
00:32:16,434 --> 00:32:19,504
All right, Hazel, you want
my attention, you got it.

416
00:32:19,505 --> 00:32:21,371
What do you have?

417
00:32:22,840 --> 00:32:25,343
Look.

418
00:32:25,344 --> 00:32:29,314
You see how her mouth was
manipulated? We think his was too.

419
00:32:29,315 --> 00:32:31,482
And there was no forced
entry in either case,

420
00:32:31,483 --> 00:32:36,386
and Ullman's body was just a few
miles over the jurisdictional line.

421
00:32:36,421 --> 00:32:37,589
And?

422
00:32:37,590 --> 00:32:39,991
Well, so he's spreading his
targets far enough apart

423
00:32:39,992 --> 00:32:43,793
and he's changing the profile of the
victims so that we don't connect them.

424
00:32:44,529 --> 00:32:46,831
Serial killers leave calling cards.

425
00:32:46,832 --> 00:32:49,267
They want the world to
know what they're doing.

426
00:32:49,268 --> 00:32:52,603
I'm telling you, I know
that this is the same guy.

427
00:32:52,604 --> 00:32:54,405
You know nothing.

428
00:32:54,406 --> 00:32:57,308
You are guessing and you want me to
give you manpower to follow a hunch.

429
00:32:57,309 --> 00:33:01,145
All I need is one detective
with profiling experience.

430
00:33:01,146 --> 00:33:04,215
You know, if I knew that sending you to
Chamberlain was going to trigger this

431
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:06,718
I would have sent somebody
who's better equipped.

432
00:33:06,719 --> 00:33:10,620
But, as I said, I don't
have anybody else.

433
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:19,095
No. No specific age or gender.

434
00:33:20,031 --> 00:33:22,432
No it could look like anything.

435
00:33:24,669 --> 00:33:27,405
Yeah, uh, yeah, the mouth.

436
00:33:27,406 --> 00:33:29,640
That's exactly what
we're looking for.

437
00:33:29,641 --> 00:33:32,509
No, it could look like a suicide.

438
00:33:33,311 --> 00:33:36,513
Uh, could you send that over to me?

439
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:25,962
Is she upstairs?

440
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:27,532
She's sleeping.

441
00:34:27,533 --> 00:34:29,432
Oh.

442
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:31,768
I just, um...

443
00:34:32,103 --> 00:34:35,171
I don't think now is a good time.

444
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:38,174
Hmm.

445
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:40,109
I'm sorry.

446
00:34:43,848 --> 00:34:45,848
I understand.

447
00:34:50,121 --> 00:34:52,121
Wait.

448
00:35:13,010 --> 00:35:15,379
Can you open your mouth for me?

449
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:17,647
Stick out your tongue.

450
00:35:18,483 --> 00:35:20,051
Ah.

What happens just
before you fall down?

452
00:35:22,855 --> 00:35:26,089
- It smells funny.
- Like what?

00:35:26,691 --> 00:35:28,758
Scrambled eggs.

454
00:35:30,027 --> 00:35:32,296
Do you like scrambled eggs?

455
00:35:32,297 --> 00:35:34,098
Not anymore.

456
00:35:34,099 --> 00:35:37,900

scrambled eggs either.

Could you bring us some honey?

Hmm. We're all going to die.
That's how God intended it.

468
00:36:40,365 --> 00:36:44,233
But how we live and how we die,

469
00:36:44,869 --> 00:36:47,303
that can be meaningful.

I looked into that
stuff you asked about.

485
00:38:00,045 --> 00:38:04,148
She had an e-mail account. Traded
gardening tips with a cousin in Calgary,

486
00:38:04,149 --> 00:38:07,184
and she visited a
soap opera chat room.

487
00:38:07,185 --> 00:38:09,185
She kept busy.

488
00:38:09,587 --> 00:38:11,856
That she did.

489
00:38:11,857 --> 00:38:14,892

was a gold cross necklace

wearing necklaces.

It's gonna be weird getting
something from her now.

00:38:30,508 --> 00:38:32,009
She never said it out loud,

00:38:32,010 --> 00:38:34,278
but she'd been suffering
for a long time.

I could see she was ready
to go. It was in her eyes.

Maybe he did her a favor.

498
00:38:42,653 --> 00:38:44,787
Doesn't make it right.

files I've been chasing down

and I think we're missing
something with the faces.

son, hanging from a chandelier.

down towards the teeth.

mouth found open. And then

we have Morton Halfe.

520
00:39:52,190 --> 00:39:55,992
Look at this, his mouth is
almost identical to Dewer's.

- Like Ullman's.
- Yeah.

All the mouths are
clearly manipulated.

530
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:21,752
So, why did you transfer from
Toronto to here, really?

531
00:40:21,753 --> 00:40:25,087
I mean, don't give me the
bullshit about a small town life.

532
00:40:26,424 --> 00:40:28,492
Um...

533
00:40:28,493 --> 00:40:31,228
Uh, my partner died last year.

534
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:32,763
On duty?

535
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,931
Uh, he wasn't a cop.

536
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:43,808
The guys on the force didn't
take that news so well.

537
00:40:43,809 --> 00:40:47,044
Well, how do you
like it here, so far?

538
00:40:47,045 --> 00:40:50,614
Excuse me, I ask a lot of questions.
It's an occupational hazard.

539
00:40:50,615 --> 00:40:52,983
No, that's okay.
Are you a reporter?

540
00:40:52,984 --> 00:40:54,118
No.

541
00:40:54,119 --> 00:40:56,854
Judge. Retired.

542
00:40:56,855 --> 00:40:59,890
Oh. Well, then, Your Honor...

543
00:40:59,891 --> 00:41:01,525
(GIGGLING)

544
00:41:01,526 --> 00:41:04,862
Um, I like it. I mean, uh,

545
00:41:04,863 --> 00:41:06,730
- it's slower.
- Mmm-hmm.

546
00:41:06,731 --> 00:41:08,432
But, uh,

547
00:41:08,433 --> 00:41:10,434
that's good, you know, it gives you

548
00:41:10,435 --> 00:41:12,570
kind of more time to think.

549
00:41:12,571 --> 00:41:14,537
Exactly.

550
00:41:16,006 --> 00:41:17,174
You been calling your mother?

551
00:41:17,175 --> 00:41:18,976
All right, stop it.

552
00:41:18,977 --> 00:41:21,278
What? Kids should talk
to their mothers.

553
00:41:21,279 --> 00:41:23,013
And some mothers talk too much.

554
00:41:23,014 --> 00:41:24,482
- Meaning me?
- Yes.

555
00:41:24,483 --> 00:41:26,183
- Okay.
- You're my mother. You're talking too much.

556
00:41:26,184 --> 00:41:28,252
- I'm hardly talking at all.
- Okay.

557
00:41:28,253 --> 00:41:29,620
- You're grilling him.
- I'm not!

558
00:41:29,621 --> 00:41:31,454
I'll clear.

559
00:41:37,795 --> 00:41:39,930
HAZEL: Next.

560
00:41:39,931 --> 00:41:43,033
RAY: Looks like he's singing.

561
00:41:43,034 --> 00:41:45,836
HAZEL: Next. What about this one?

562
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:49,672
The mouth's pressed
together. What if...

563
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:55,279
Seriously, what if
he's saying something?

564
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:58,782
- He's not saying something, he's dead.
- I know.

565
00:41:58,783 --> 00:42:00,618
Well, is he saying anything?

566
00:42:00,619 --> 00:42:03,019
It's like a... Look, it's like a...

567
00:42:03,320 --> 00:42:05,122
Buh, like a buh.

568
00:42:05,123 --> 00:42:06,590
No, it's mmm...

569
00:42:06,591 --> 00:42:09,026
Mmm, mmm. Muh.

570
00:42:09,027 --> 00:42:10,961
Well, go to the next one.

571
00:42:10,962 --> 00:42:12,196
That's it, go on.

572
00:42:12,197 --> 00:42:13,697
BEN:
The upper lip is bent. It's buh.

573
00:42:13,698 --> 00:42:15,199
Now do it again.

574
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:18,102
Say a sentence that has a "muh"
sound and a "buh" sound.

575
00:42:18,103 --> 00:42:19,370
You're going to see the difference.

576
00:42:19,371 --> 00:42:21,872
Your mother got hit by a bus.

577
00:42:21,873 --> 00:42:25,079
Yeah. Do you see...
Your... Mother...

578
00:42:25,105 --> 00:42:27,845
- Muh and buh, they're two entirely...
- Okay, try it again.

579
00:42:27,846 --> 00:42:30,195
BEN: Okay, that's a mouth
that's wide open, right?

580
00:42:30,196 --> 00:42:31,081
HAZEL: Go back.

581
00:42:31,082 --> 00:42:33,417
MATHIESEN: If you look at it,
the lips are curled in. Mmm.

582
00:42:33,418 --> 00:42:36,520
BEN: You're right if you're
talking about Portuguese.

583
00:42:36,521 --> 00:42:38,589
MATHIESEN:
I don't speak Portuguese.

584
00:42:38,590 --> 00:42:41,692
Or maybe it's not what they're
saying as individuals.

585
00:42:41,693 --> 00:42:46,063
Maybe they're syllables and
whoever manipulated their mouths

586
00:42:46,064 --> 00:42:50,433
is saying something with
them all... Will you be quiet!

587
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:56,340
RAY: Well, some of them don't look
like they're saying anything together.

588
00:42:56,341 --> 00:42:58,008
Maybe it's in the
wrong order, then.

589
00:42:58,009 --> 00:42:59,677
Well, it's the order
that we found them.

590
00:42:59,678 --> 00:43:02,880
Well, maybe it's a different order. Maybe
it's the order in which they were killed.

591
00:43:02,881 --> 00:43:05,849
How about if we try it
going from west to east?

592
00:43:05,850 --> 00:43:09,620
So, that would be Dewar,
Grunwald, Fortnum. Try that.

593
00:43:09,621 --> 00:43:11,420
Okay.

594
00:43:15,459 --> 00:43:17,460
Faster.

595
00:43:18,529 --> 00:43:20,864
BEN: The vowels? Think
about how many vowels.

596
00:43:20,865 --> 00:43:23,300
Vowels make you open
your entire mouth.

597
00:43:23,301 --> 00:43:25,703
I mean, think about it.
It's only buh or muh,

598
00:43:25,704 --> 00:43:28,704
it's slow but it's
something like a...

599
00:43:29,506 --> 00:43:31,574
Jesus.

600
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:54,932
MATHIESEN: Lie-bee-la.

601
00:43:54,933 --> 00:43:57,534
Lie-bee-la. Lie-bee-la?

602
00:43:57,535 --> 00:44:01,505
No, no, no, it's Lie-bee-ra.

603
00:44:01,506 --> 00:44:03,307
It's an "R". Look at, uh...

604
00:44:03,308 --> 00:44:05,209
Look at his mouth.

605
00:44:05,210 --> 00:44:07,277
That's an L. Now can you flip
to Ruby Marshall, please?

606
00:44:07,278 --> 00:44:10,848
Yeah. See how the tongue is kind
of on the side of the mouth?

607
00:44:10,849 --> 00:44:13,917
That's an R. It's ra.

608
00:44:13,918 --> 00:44:18,320
As in, "You're wrong."

609
00:44:18,956 --> 00:44:21,790
Lie-bee-ra

610
00:44:21,859 --> 00:44:24,660
ri-e. Ra-ri-e.

611
00:44:25,562 --> 00:44:30,199
It's Professor Plume in the
lie-bee-ra-ri-e with the candlestick.

612
00:44:32,036 --> 00:44:34,370
(SIGHS) I'm done.

613
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:23,187
Hey, guys. What if
it isn't English?

614
00:45:23,188 --> 00:45:25,654
What do you mean, like French?

615
00:45:27,124 --> 00:45:29,191
Huh.

616
00:45:35,999 --> 00:45:40,804
(GASPS) They were all Catholic.

617
00:45:40,805 --> 00:45:45,375
It's Latin. I guarantee
you, this is Latin.

618
00:45:45,376 --> 00:45:48,045
Latin? Who speaks Latin?

619
00:45:48,046 --> 00:45:49,880
People in Latin America.

620
00:45:49,881 --> 00:45:53,650
Oh, God. It... Listen,
it sounds like Latin.

621
00:45:53,651 --> 00:45:55,285
- It's not that.
- Lie-bee-ra.

622
00:45:55,286 --> 00:45:57,553
BEN: I guarantee you that's Latin.

623
00:46:04,795 --> 00:46:09,465
Well, I know the words, but I don't
actually speak the language.

624
00:46:09,466 --> 00:46:11,168
Oh.

625
00:46:11,169 --> 00:46:15,606
Now, Father Price at Saint Xavier,
he was a linguistics professor.

626
00:46:15,607 --> 00:46:17,606
He could help.

627
00:46:54,745 --> 00:46:57,981
When you get to be my age
it's a comfort to have

628
00:46:57,982 --> 00:47:01,752
those reminders of
some accomplishments.

629
00:47:01,753 --> 00:47:04,620
- Sit, sit down, please.
- Thank you, Father.

630
00:47:04,988 --> 00:47:06,957
They're your students?

631
00:47:06,958 --> 00:47:08,625
No.

632
00:47:08,626 --> 00:47:12,261
We used to take in orphans
and find them homes.

633
00:47:12,529 --> 00:47:15,097
But you don't anymore.

634
00:47:15,132 --> 00:47:17,166
No.

635
00:47:18,302 --> 00:47:21,305
But you didn't come here
to talk about that.

636
00:47:21,306 --> 00:47:23,407
No.

637
00:47:23,408 --> 00:47:27,910
Could you help me and
tell me what that means?

638
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:32,683
(CHUCKLES) <i>Libera.</i>

639
00:47:32,684 --> 00:47:35,485
It's the imperative
of the Latin verb

640
00:47:35,486 --> 00:47:39,890
that is at the root
of liberty. Liberate.

641
00:47:39,891 --> 00:47:44,026
Well, let me see.
With the E following,

642
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:47,631
<i>eos. Libera eos.</i>

643
00:47:47,632 --> 00:47:49,299
Deliver them.

644
00:47:49,300 --> 00:47:55,205
So does that phrase mean
anything special to you?

645
00:47:55,206 --> 00:47:58,175
<i>Libera nos domine.</i>

646
00:47:58,176 --> 00:48:01,178
Now, that's quite a common phrase.

647
00:48:01,179 --> 00:48:06,014
Free us Lord. Um, <i>Libera.</i>

648
00:48:06,450 --> 00:48:11,555
<i>Re-Eos. Libera-re-Eos.
Libera-re-Eos.</i>

649
00:48:11,556 --> 00:48:14,458
- And what does that mean?
- Set them free.

650
00:48:14,459 --> 00:48:17,027
So, they're similar.

651
00:48:17,028 --> 00:48:19,396
Similar, yes, but not at
all the same. Do you...

652
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:22,299
Do you know anything about the
history of the written Bible?

653
00:48:22,300 --> 00:48:25,736
Well, I always thought
it was kind of like

654
00:48:25,737 --> 00:48:29,805
- a 2,000 year-old game of broken telephone.
- (CHUCKLES)

655
00:48:31,041 --> 00:48:35,612
Let me explain. The
Bible, as we know it,

656
00:48:35,613 --> 00:48:39,883
was composed around
400 <i>Anno Domini.</i>

657
00:48:39,884 --> 00:48:42,653
It contained an oral component,

658
00:48:42,654 --> 00:48:46,924
because elements of that Bible were
prohibited from being written down.

659
00:48:46,925 --> 00:48:49,426
Forbidden songs.
Blessings conferred

660
00:48:49,427 --> 00:48:52,362
upon the closest of
Christ's disciples.

661
00:48:52,363 --> 00:48:56,667
These were meant to be communicated
only between high priests,

662
00:48:56,668 --> 00:48:59,703
because once the
blessing was offered,

663
00:48:59,704 --> 00:49:02,406
the listener became
the keeper of it.

664
00:49:02,407 --> 00:49:06,176
And the speaker, on
certain occasions,

665
00:49:06,177 --> 00:49:09,413
offered himself up as a sacrifice.

666
00:49:09,414 --> 00:49:11,815
For what?

667
00:49:11,816 --> 00:49:18,153
<i>Liberare Eos.</i> A sacrifice
to set them free.

668
00:49:18,855 --> 00:49:22,157
- So you do know what it means.
- (CHUCKLES)

669
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:24,693
Uh, I have...

670
00:49:25,162 --> 00:49:28,265
Oh, here.

671
00:49:28,266 --> 00:49:33,236
When the women went to complete
the burial rites at Christ's tomb,

672
00:49:33,237 --> 00:49:34,905
- they found it empty.
- Hmm.

673
00:49:34,906 --> 00:49:38,642
Their service was rewarded by the
Holy Ghost with that prayer.

674
00:49:38,643 --> 00:49:41,276
A consecration against death.

675
00:49:41,478 --> 00:49:43,146
So immortality?

676
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:45,349
No, not quite.

677
00:49:45,350 --> 00:49:49,785
<i>Liberare Eos</i> is a
prayer of resurrection.

678
00:49:52,422 --> 00:49:54,923
Okay.

679
00:49:56,059 --> 00:49:59,228
Ah, back then, people
had deeper faith.

680
00:49:59,229 --> 00:50:01,463
Blind faith.

681
00:50:01,598 --> 00:50:04,099
Profound faith.

682
00:50:07,671 --> 00:50:11,375
Well, how exactly does it work?

683
00:50:11,376 --> 00:50:13,942
I promise I won't tell anybody.

684
00:50:15,479 --> 00:50:19,783
It required 12 willing souls

685
00:50:19,784 --> 00:50:24,187
to sacrifice themselves
to bring back the one.

686
00:50:24,188 --> 00:50:27,424
Now, the operative
word is, "willing."

687
00:50:27,425 --> 00:50:30,359
Once the final life was given,

688
00:50:31,194 --> 00:50:35,832
the prayer was spoken
aloud and witnessed.

689
00:50:35,833 --> 00:50:41,271
And then those 12 disciples
who sacrificed themselves

690
00:50:41,272 --> 00:50:44,107
were granted eternal salvation.

691
00:50:44,108 --> 00:50:48,678
And the chosen one was reborn.

692
00:50:48,679 --> 00:50:52,682
I mean, you know, this is
early Christian mysticism.

693
00:50:52,683 --> 00:50:55,619
This pre-dates even the Vatican.

694
00:50:55,620 --> 00:50:58,153
And do you really
believe this stuff?

695
00:50:58,789 --> 00:51:03,427
(SIGHS) I did, yes, once.

696
00:51:03,428 --> 00:51:05,796
But times are different now.

697
00:51:05,797 --> 00:51:08,999
Unwavering belief in the church is

698
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:12,235
difficult to sustain.

699
00:51:12,236 --> 00:51:15,971
Perhaps, I mean,
I think quite possibly,

700
00:51:16,173 --> 00:51:18,540
with good reason.

701
00:51:19,342 --> 00:51:23,747
I find it fascinating
that someone like you

702
00:51:23,748 --> 00:51:28,285
would be interested in
unearthing this prayer

703
00:51:28,286 --> 00:51:32,589
that has been for 1,500 years,

704
00:51:32,590 --> 00:51:35,624
by and large, lost.

705
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:39,528
I think somebody may have found it.

706
00:52:26,676 --> 00:52:29,980
If you can sleep on the floor
why can't I sleep in my chair?

707
00:52:29,981 --> 00:52:32,314
'Cause I'm special.

708
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:35,951
- Let's go up.
- You certainly are.

709
00:52:48,365 --> 00:52:51,535
Hey! Do you remember that gold cross
that Delia Chandler bought online?

710
00:52:51,536 --> 00:52:53,803
- Yeah.
- They never got it.

711
00:52:53,804 --> 00:52:55,784
Nothing showed up
at Delia's either.

712
00:52:56,306 --> 00:52:58,441
- So?
- Overstock.com shipped through

713
00:52:58,442 --> 00:53:02,679
a PO box in Port Hardy, BC,
addressed to Jane Buck.

714
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:04,789
- BC?
- I called Delia's son.

715
00:53:04,815 --> 00:53:06,983
He's never heard of her.

716
00:53:06,984 --> 00:53:09,519
The post office wouldn't give out
any information over the phone,

717
00:53:09,520 --> 00:53:11,922
so I looked up Jane Buck in the
local white pages and guess what?

718
00:53:11,923 --> 00:53:13,323
What?

719
00:53:13,324 --> 00:53:18,693
There's a phone number and home
address 10 miles from that PO box.

720
00:53:31,241 --> 00:53:33,310
- Go for it.

721
00:53:33,311 --> 00:53:35,310
Oh.

00:53:42,385 --> 00:53:44,554
- WOMAN: (OVER SPEAKER) <i>Hello?</i>
- Hello.

723
00:53:44,555 --> 00:53:46,755
Is this Jane Buck?

724

<i>Who is this?</i>

725
00:53:49,160 --> 00:53:51,628
This is Officer Ben Wingate, from
the Fort Dundas Police Department.

726
00:53:51,629 --> 00:53:56,331
You wouldn't happen to know anyone by
the name of Delia Chandler, would you?

727
00:53:59,069 --> 00:54:00,837
<i>This isn't a good time.</i>

728
00:54:00,838 --> 00:54:04,506
Okay. When would be a good time?

729
00:54:09,446 --> 00:54:10,880
Could be a lead.

730
00:54:10,881 --> 00:54:13,783
Come on, you gotta let me go.

731
00:54:13,784 --> 00:54:17,587
I would love to let you go, but I don't
have the money to fly you there.

732
00:54:17,588 --> 00:54:22,659
My mom gives me Air Miles every year
for Christmas. I've never used them.

733
00:54:22,660 --> 00:54:23,927
(DOOR OPENING)

734
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:26,161
I found our Olds.

735
00:54:36,506 --> 00:54:39,441
This is where he got the ticket.

736
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:46,181
Okay. Well, let's start
knocking on some doors.

737
00:54:50,453 --> 00:54:52,389
So you just let him in?

738
00:54:52,390 --> 00:54:56,092
I spoke with him for quite
a while at the diner.

739
00:54:56,093 --> 00:55:00,363
My daughter was very sick and I
believed that he could help her.

740
00:55:00,364 --> 00:55:03,700
I was desperate. Nothing
else was working.

741
00:55:03,701 --> 00:55:05,835
RAY: What did he look like?

742
00:55:05,836 --> 00:55:08,438
Tall, thin.

743
00:55:08,439 --> 00:55:10,407
He had a big bag.

744
00:55:10,408 --> 00:55:15,612
Dark coat. Sandy
blonde hair. Beard.

745
00:55:15,613 --> 00:55:20,250
I remember he had kind eyes.
I don't know if that helps.

746
00:55:20,251 --> 00:55:23,320
Okay, so you let him in
and then what happened?

747
00:55:23,321 --> 00:55:25,455
He gave her some tea.

748
00:55:25,456 --> 00:55:29,959
He came out, he said
she was sleeping.

749
00:55:29,960 --> 00:55:34,996
So I looked in on her. She looked
peaceful, so I let her rest.

750
00:55:35,899 --> 00:55:41,036
Then she woke up screaming,
vomiting, burning up.

751
00:55:41,438 --> 00:55:43,540
I took her to the hospital.

752
00:55:43,541 --> 00:55:47,742
They told us it was a 50-50 chance
she'd make it through the night.

753
00:55:49,145 --> 00:55:54,616
Two days later the vomiting
stopped and the MRI was clear.

754
00:55:57,253 --> 00:55:58,655
Yeah, hon.

755
00:55:58,656 --> 00:56:00,256
(WHISPERING)
I want to show you a drawing.

756
00:56:00,257 --> 00:56:03,458
Okay. Excuse me just for a second.

Killers kill. They don't heal.

758
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:13,303
You know, Jesus raised a
little girl from the dead.

759
00:56:13,304 --> 00:56:16,239
She was about that age. It was one
of his top 10 miracles, actually.

760
00:56:16,240 --> 00:56:17,674
You're referencing scriptures now?

761
00:56:17,675 --> 00:56:19,175
I did my research.

762
00:56:19,176 --> 00:56:21,010
Okay, so you really
believe that this guy...

763
00:56:21,011 --> 00:56:23,179
- I think she believes that this guy...

Simon said you would come.

766
00:56:28,986 --> 00:56:31,821
His name Is Simon?

767
00:56:31,822 --> 00:56:34,224
And did Simon say anything else?

768
00:56:34,225 --> 00:56:37,127
He said the police would
be looking for him.

769
00:56:37,128 --> 00:56:40,196
That they would say
he did bad things.

770
00:56:40,197 --> 00:56:42,330
But he's not bad.

771
00:56:43,400 --> 00:56:45,767
He taught me a song.

in the freezer. I'm asking...

01:23:58,867 --> 01:24:02,504
We could only find a
home for one of them.

1050
01:24:02,505 --> 01:24:06,773
Father Price chose to
send the younger boy,

1051
01:24:08,443 --> 01:24:10,710
Gabriel.

1052
01:24:14,115 --> 01:24:17,751
We didn't ask a lot of
questions in those days.

1053
01:24:21,056 --> 01:24:24,724
Broke his heart when he
learned how he had suffered.

1054
01:24:28,363 --> 01:24:32,966
Peter found him, took him in.
They moved out West.

1055
01:24:32,967 --> 01:24:35,870
Away.

1056
01:24:35,871 --> 01:24:39,272
But it was too late.
He was never the same.

1057
01:24:42,610 --> 01:24:46,815
Gabriel took his own
life last year.

1058
01:24:46,816 --> 01:24:51,051
A few weeks later,
Father Price grew ill.

1059
01:24:51,052 --> 01:24:53,655
Cancer.

1060
01:24:53,656 --> 01:24:57,357
He felt it was God's
way of punishing him.

1061
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:03,364
When was the last time
that you saw Peter?

1062
01:25:03,365 --> 01:25:09,537
Three months ago, after his brother's
passing, he came to Sunday service.

1063
01:25:09,538 --> 01:25:12,272
Said he was going on a long trip.

1064
01:25:13,007 --> 01:25:16,843
And a few weeks ago
he called Father Price.

1065
01:25:17,779 --> 01:25:20,013
Really?

1066
01:25:22,150 --> 01:25:24,692
I figured out who he is.
His name is Peter Mallick...

1067
01:25:24,693 --> 01:25:26,554
- ...and he changed his...
- We know.

1068
01:25:26,555 --> 01:25:28,857
- What do you mean, you know?
- We got into his e-mail account.

1069
01:25:28,858 --> 01:25:30,925
We know who he is. We
know where he's going.

1070
01:25:30,926 --> 01:25:35,463
Carl Smotes. We're coordinating with the
RCMP to put him into protective custody.

1071
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:36,831
When?

1072
01:25:36,832 --> 01:25:40,435
- It's not your concern anymore, Hazel.
- What? What are you talking about?

1073
01:25:40,436 --> 01:25:42,203
We can handle this.

1074
01:25:42,204 --> 01:25:43,805
No! I wanna be there. What do
you mean, you can handle it?

1075
01:25:43,806 --> 01:25:45,540
I'm the one that figured it out.

1076
01:25:45,541 --> 01:25:47,575
I'm the one that told you
about it in the first place...

1077
01:25:47,576 --> 01:25:49,277
- You're done!
- ...and you wouldn't even listen to...

1078
01:25:49,278 --> 01:25:51,579
- You're done!
- I'm not done! I wanna be there.

1079
01:25:51,580 --> 01:25:54,549
What do you want
from me, an apology?

1080
01:25:54,550 --> 01:25:57,886
I am sorry. You were right.

1081
01:25:57,887 --> 01:26:02,889
There's a serial killer. Does
that make you feel better?

1082
01:26:04,359 --> 01:26:06,526
Fuck you.

1083
01:27:11,459 --> 01:27:13,793
(ENGINE STARTS)

1084
01:27:31,713 --> 01:27:34,314
(PHONE RINGING)

1085
01:27:43,992 --> 01:27:45,793
- HAZEL: <i>Hello?</i>
- Hey, it's me.

1086
01:27:45,794 --> 01:27:47,028
Did they get him?

1087
01:27:47,029 --> 01:27:49,629
<i>No. It's gonna be a long night.</i>

1088
01:27:50,832 --> 01:27:53,366
They brought in the cavalry.

1089
01:27:54,402 --> 01:27:57,405
Uh, you should be here.

1090
01:27:57,406 --> 01:28:00,341
<i>The guys are all really
impressed with what you did.</i>

1091
01:28:00,342 --> 01:28:02,443
<i>You saved a man's life.</i>

1092
01:28:02,444 --> 01:28:05,580
Well, if he was talking to Simon
then that meant he wanted to die.

1093
01:28:05,581 --> 01:28:07,582
So I don't think he's
gonna be too happy.

1094
01:28:07,583 --> 01:28:10,985
<i>Well, when he shows up,
we're gonna get him.</i>

1095
01:28:10,986 --> 01:28:13,054
What if he doesn't show up?

1096
01:28:13,055 --> 01:28:15,490
I don't know. I mean,
he's come this far.

1097
01:28:15,491 --> 01:28:19,627
I don't think he's gonna stop now. One
away from getting his 12 disciples?

1098
01:28:19,628 --> 01:28:21,795
<i>He's coming.</i>

1099
01:28:24,065 --> 01:28:26,334
<i>Are you still there?</i>

1100
01:28:26,335 --> 01:28:28,067
Yeah, I'm here.

1101
01:28:29,437 --> 01:28:31,639
I have my day off tomorrow.

1102
01:28:31,640 --> 01:28:34,674
<i>Why don't I come by?
I'll cook you dinner.</i>

1103
01:28:35,677 --> 01:28:37,744
Goodnight, Wingate.

1104

01:30:17,311 --> 01:30:19,612
I'll get you something for that.

(EXHALING)

1109
01:30:25,686 --> 01:30:27,688
Why did you bring me here?

1110
01:30:27,689 --> 01:30:29,924
You brought us together.

1111
01:30:29,925 --> 01:30:32,660
You heard the calling

1112
01:30:32,661 --> 01:30:34,896
when everyone around you could not.

1113
01:30:34,897 --> 01:30:39,432
And you chose to
become a part of it.

1114
01:30:43,504 --> 01:30:47,674
This is where we're
supposed to be, together,

1115
01:30:48,276 --> 01:30:50,276
under the eyes of God.

1116
01:30:53,414 --> 01:30:55,283
And this is where it will end.

1117
01:30:55,284 --> 01:30:57,585
Mmm-mmm. No.

1118
01:30:57,586 --> 01:31:00,453
- For your pain.
- No.

1119
01:31:02,523 --> 01:31:06,166
All the disciples gave themselves
willingly. Murdering you will not...

1120
01:31:06,167 --> 01:31:08,119
honor the prayer.

1121
01:31:10,031 --> 01:31:14,500
Do you want your pain
to end or do you not?

1122
01:31:15,703 --> 01:31:18,104
It is your choice.

1123
01:31:34,689 --> 01:31:36,356
(EXHALES)

1124
01:31:39,026 --> 01:31:41,461
Hmm?

(BREATHING HEAVILY)

1126
01:32:03,784 --> 01:32:06,286
It's remarkable, isn't it?

1127
01:32:06,287 --> 01:32:08,589
What is it?

1128
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:12,492
A hybrid of many plants.
Grown here.

1129
01:32:14,428 --> 01:32:18,231
You could be helping
people instead of...

1130
01:32:18,766 --> 01:32:20,201
Doing this.

1131
01:32:20,202 --> 01:32:22,301
I am

1132
01:32:23,337 --> 01:32:26,272
helping people.

1133
01:32:31,946 --> 01:32:35,286
I know you lost your brother and
you'll do anything to bring him back.

1134
01:32:36,584 --> 01:32:38,586
But what is the point?

1135
01:32:38,587 --> 01:32:41,722
I mean, he killed himself.
He doesn't want to be alive.

1136
01:32:41,723 --> 01:32:44,290
He wanted to die.

1137
01:32:46,961 --> 01:32:49,762
Everyone deserves a second chance.

1138
01:32:51,299 --> 01:32:55,168
Hazel, I lost my brother but I
never lost my faith in God.

1139
01:32:56,170 --> 01:33:01,741
When he returns,
he will be cleansed,

1140
01:33:03,678 --> 01:33:05,578
as will you.

1141
01:33:35,509 --> 01:33:37,612
Can you imagine a day

1142
01:33:37,613 --> 01:33:42,849
when you're not clouded
by all that alcohol?

1143
01:33:46,954 --> 01:33:48,855
No.

1144
01:33:49,357 --> 01:33:53,995
Tell me something beautiful,

1145
01:33:53,996 --> 01:33:58,097
something good that you've
brought to this world.

1146
01:34:02,770 --> 01:34:04,305
Nothing.

1147
01:34:04,306 --> 01:34:09,408
Have you ever loved? Really loved?

1148
01:34:10,077 --> 01:34:15,014
Someone... Someone
other than yourself?

1149
01:34:20,521 --> 01:34:25,158
What have you lost, truly lost,

1150
01:34:26,827 --> 01:34:29,829
that had some meaning for you?

1151
01:34:36,303 --> 01:34:38,804
My baby.

1152
01:34:57,558 --> 01:35:00,159
This is your chance.

1153
01:35:04,198 --> 01:35:09,001
Drink this and all your
suffering will be gone.

1154
01:35:09,904 --> 01:35:14,273
Drink this and bring
meaning to your life.

1155
01:35:15,109 --> 01:35:19,613
Drink this and offer the
disciples unto God.

1156
01:35:19,614 --> 01:35:26,919
Drink this and bring
life back to this world.

1157
01:35:31,192 --> 01:35:33,593
Let go.

1158
01:35:43,537 --> 01:35:48,241
I can't. I want another
chance, please.

1159
01:35:58,519 --> 01:36:00,620

1160
01:36:18,572 --> 01:36:20,740
It's okay.

Uh, Andrew, nice to meet you.
Um, ah, Gladys.

01:38:21,596 --> 01:38:23,997
- No, it's Glynnis.
- Okay.

Ben?

1168
01:38:25,333 --> 01:38:27,701
Oh, hey man. Come on in.

1169
01:38:27,702 --> 01:38:32,738
Yeah. Uh... I'm... I'm gonna
come back again another time.

1170
01:38:33,607 --> 01:38:35,674
You sure?

1171
01:38:36,977 --> 01:38:38,911
Yeah.

1172
01:38:39,179 --> 01:38:41,280
Give this to her for me?

1173
01:38:41,448 --> 01:38:43,350
Uh, yeah, okay.

1174
01:38:43,351 --> 01:38:45,251
Thanks.

1175
01:38:51,859 --> 01:38:54,760
Sorry. Should I, uh...

1176
01:38:56,430 --> 01:38:59,165
- Should I...
- Come on in.

1177
01:39:00,768 --> 01:39:02,835
How is she doing?

1178
01:39:03,737 --> 01:39:05,806
Drugs finally knocked her out.

1179
01:39:05,807 --> 01:39:11,043
Right. She's probably
got quite a tolerance.

1180
01:39:11,178 --> 01:39:12,346
Yeah.

1181
01:39:12,347 --> 01:39:14,882
Andrew and his wife
are in the hall.

1182
01:39:14,883 --> 01:39:18,886
Oh, dear. I'll go head 'em off.

1183
01:39:18,887 --> 01:39:22,321
Okay. Do I... Right.

1184
01:39:39,273 --> 01:39:42,042
Ah, hey.

1185
01:39:42,043 --> 01:39:44,343
Hey.

1186
01:39:46,313 --> 01:39:50,950
It's from Ray. The
flowers are from me.

1187
01:39:51,719 --> 01:39:53,686
I'm allergic.

1188
01:39:56,623 --> 01:39:59,360
Why am I not surprised?

1189
01:39:59,361 --> 01:40:04,563
This is also from me and Ray.

1190
01:40:06,100 --> 01:40:09,468
- You did it.
- We did it.

1191
01:40:13,073 --> 01:40:15,209
What about his brother?

1192
01:40:15,210 --> 01:40:19,580
Vancouver PD sent some
guys to recover the body.

1193
01:40:19,581 --> 01:40:22,348
I just haven't heard anything yet.

1194
01:40:22,449 --> 01:40:24,118
Let me know.

1195
01:40:24,119 --> 01:40:29,522
I'll be out in that hall
until I know, okay?

1196
01:40:31,125 --> 01:40:33,158
Okay.

1197
01:40:39,433 --> 01:40:41,700
I want my mom.

1198
01:40:44,671 --> 01:40:47,808
Wow. These drugs must be working.

1200
01:41:03,757 --> 01:41:06,058
You're awake.

01:41:08,362 --> 01:41:10,597
- What's this?
- Oh, Ray.

1202
01:41:10,598 --> 01:41:13,534
He didn't bring glasses
or ice or anything.

1203
01:41:13,535 --> 01:41:16,035
Forget about it.

1204
01:41:18,839 --> 01:41:20,873
You look terrible.

1205
01:41:22,810 --> 01:41:27,079
Yeah. It's better than dead.

1206
01:41:29,016 --> 01:41:31,383
Much better.
