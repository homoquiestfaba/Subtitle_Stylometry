still talk to me?

182
00:10:21,037 --> 00:10:24,122
Talk about what?

183
00:10:32,923 --> 00:10:36,426
Hey, uh...

184
00:10:39,138 --> 00:10:40,972
What the hell's goin' on?

185
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,016
Dad, what are
you doing here?

186
00:10:43,184 --> 00:10:45,477
Dad? Sir...

187
00:10:45,645 --> 00:10:47,228
l do remember thinking

188
00:10:47,396 --> 00:10:51,149
why wouId a dude
bring a trumpet into a movie theater?

189
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,993
Barry?

190
00:11:03,621 --> 00:11:06,206
Barry, can you
tell us what happened?

191
00:11:08,084 --> 00:11:10,335
We were taIking
about architecture.

192
00:11:10,503 --> 00:11:13,713
Barry, l'm sorry to be the one
to have to tell you,

193
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:16,049
but we couldn't
save them.

194
00:11:16,217 --> 00:11:18,677
Save who?

195
00:11:18,844 --> 00:11:22,097
Oh, Barry,
your testes.

196
00:11:23,849 --> 00:11:26,309
Testicles.
We had to remove both.

197
00:11:26,477 --> 00:11:29,437
We really tried
to save the left one,

198
00:11:29,605 --> 00:11:32,190
but it was simply
too ruptured.

199
00:11:32,358 --> 00:11:35,568
lt seems that during
the accident with the...

200
00:11:35,736 --> 00:11:37,779
- Uh, trumpet.
- ...trumpet.

201
00:11:37,947 --> 00:11:39,864
What are you saying?

202
00:11:40,032 --> 00:11:42,701
You're saying
l lost my what?

203
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:44,536
Amnesia.

204
00:11:47,707 --> 00:11:49,457
- Did l lose my...
- Whoa.

205
00:11:49,625 --> 00:11:52,001
- ...you know?
- Penis?

206
00:11:52,169 --> 00:11:54,713
- No.

207
00:11:58,384 --> 00:12:02,512
You really don't remember
what happened to you down there?

208
00:12:04,974 --> 00:12:07,392
We were taIking
about architecture.

209
00:12:09,854 --> 00:12:12,188
Get out of there.

210
00:12:17,653 --> 00:12:20,238
This is kinda Iike
when you had your tonsils out.

211
00:12:20,406 --> 00:12:22,866

221
00:13:23,969 --> 00:13:25,303
were Iike
looking at me,

222
00:13:25,471 --> 00:13:27,764
and they're like,
"Best habitat ever."

223
00:13:27,932 --> 00:13:29,808
Where have you been, mister?

224
00:13:31,894 --> 00:13:34,103
- Lida, l--
- ReIax.

225
00:13:34,271 --> 00:13:35,980
l forgive you.

226
00:13:36,148 --> 00:13:38,733
l guess l forgot to
mention my girlfriend Lida Griggs

227
00:13:38,901 --> 00:13:41,444
was out of town
when the incident occurred.

228
00:13:41,612 --> 00:13:43,780
It's a Iong story,
but we don't see each other

229
00:13:43,948 --> 00:13:46,157
for sometimes weeks
or months at a time.

230
00:13:46,325 --> 00:13:48,451
l need to borrow
your alarm clock.

231
00:13:49,829 --> 00:13:52,622
Pretty sure we don't
really like each other.

232
00:13:59,463 --> 00:14:01,464
Let's go, lover.

233
00:14:01,632 --> 00:14:04,259
We're going to try something
new today, lover.

234
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:11,140
Lida, ah, why don't we
just watch a movie?

235
00:14:11,308 --> 00:14:12,517
Shh.

236
00:14:17,815 --> 00:14:20,108
- Lida, I--
- All tight?

237
00:14:20,276 --> 00:14:21,609
Yeah.

238
00:14:21,777 --> 00:14:24,445
But we should
taIk first.

239
00:14:24,613 --> 00:14:27,323
Why don't we start
by talking about...

240
00:14:27,491 --> 00:14:28,700
this?

241
00:14:30,035 --> 00:14:31,411
l found it in your car
when l was looking

242
00:14:31,579 --> 00:14:33,496
for my Iavender and
vanilla body soufflé.

243
00:14:33,664 --> 00:14:35,707
Lida, listen--

244
00:14:35,875 --> 00:14:39,252
- ls it true?
- Um...

245
00:14:39,420 --> 00:14:41,254
- Did you show her your penis?
- What?

246
00:14:41,422 --> 00:14:42,797
- You whore!
- No, Lida--

247
00:14:42,965 --> 00:14:44,549
- Did you let her play with this?
- Stop.

248
00:14:48,971 --> 00:14:50,638
l had an accident.

249
00:14:50,806 --> 00:14:54,851
Barry, l don't know
what all of this is,

250
00:14:55,019 --> 00:14:58,438
but Peaches and l have no sympathy
for cheating asshoIes.

251
00:14:58,606 --> 00:15:00,982
And if you think
the love l give you

252
00:15:01,150 --> 00:15:02,901
is aII fun
and games,

253
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,403
well...

254
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,447
you had better sleep
with one eye open, mister.

255
00:15:07,615 --> 00:15:09,407
Can you untie me?

256
00:15:10,743 --> 00:15:11,951
Come, Peaches.

257
00:15:24,924 --> 00:15:27,175
Barry honey, it's Mom.

258
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:29,510
l picked up your hormone pills
at the pharmacy.

259
00:15:29,678 --> 00:15:31,137
Honey?

260
00:15:31,305 --> 00:15:33,181
Barry, l hope it's okay,
but l brought Janice with me

261
00:15:33,349 --> 00:15:35,767
- from my Latin dance symposium.
- Hi, Barry.

262
00:15:38,646 --> 00:15:40,146
Excuse me, Lonnie?

263
00:15:41,565 --> 00:15:43,691
Talk to you later.

264
00:15:46,946 --> 00:15:49,781
Hey, um...

265
00:15:53,786 --> 00:15:56,663
l was wondering
if l could take a leave of absence.

266
00:15:56,830 --> 00:16:00,375
Um, l had a...
with a...

267
00:16:00,542 --> 00:16:03,461
and um...

268
00:16:03,629 --> 00:16:05,463
just wonderin'
if l could take a few days off.

269
00:16:05,631 --> 00:16:09,050
It's aII I'm thinkin'--
just time to get, you know.

270
00:16:09,218 --> 00:16:12,512
Basically,
l have some family issues.

271
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:14,889
Now, first of all Barry,
you're lying.

272
00:16:16,934 --> 00:16:18,226
l've been in this business
for 40 years

273
00:16:18,394 --> 00:16:20,144
and l can always
tell the difference.

274
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,146
You don't have
any family issues, do you?

275
00:16:22,314 --> 00:16:25,149
Well, l have--

276
00:16:28,904 --> 00:16:30,863
Well, you're just lazy.

277
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:32,365
You know, you sit
in your office

278
00:16:32,533 --> 00:16:34,075
pretending to be
on the telephone,

279
00:16:34,243 --> 00:16:35,702
shuffling papers all day,

280
00:16:35,869 --> 00:16:37,286
and every hour or so
you get up and walk

281
00:16:37,454 --> 00:16:40,331
around Lucy's desk
like a four-balled tomcat.

282
00:16:40,499 --> 00:16:42,792
And what's worse,

283
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:45,003
you don't even care enough
to cover it up.

284
00:16:46,797 --> 00:16:48,965
Also,

285
00:16:49,133 --> 00:16:51,467
it's just my
opinion, but...

286
00:16:52,678 --> 00:16:55,179
I don't think men
should wear makeup.

287
00:16:57,599 --> 00:17:00,435
See you tomorrow,
Barry.

288
00:17:01,562 --> 00:17:03,354
Okay.

289
00:17:05,524 --> 00:17:07,567
You have one message.

290
00:17:07,735 --> 00:17:10,069
- Yo, Mundo,

291
00:17:10,237 --> 00:17:11,946
you know who it is.
Where the hell you been?

292
00:17:12,114 --> 00:17:13,990
Shit, bro, listen,

293
00:17:14,158 --> 00:17:15,825

where l am right now.

294
00:17:15,993 --> 00:17:19,078
Regional Air Guitar Semifinals.

295
00:17:19,246 --> 00:17:21,122
So, l was thinkin',

296
00:17:21,290 --> 00:17:23,124
if l make it onto the finals,

297
00:17:23,292 --> 00:17:24,709
maybe you could use
a IittIe ta-da,

298
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,919
we raise a glass
down at the Beaver Tree.

299
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:28,838
Titty bar bush, baby.

300
00:17:29,006 --> 00:17:31,340
Be there,
or be a fuckin' tool.

301
00:17:31,508 --> 00:17:33,051
Later!

302
00:17:33,218 --> 00:17:35,720

317
00:18:33,779 --> 00:18:36,280
Ginger Farley?

318
00:18:36,448 --> 00:18:38,991
Who the fuck
is Ginger Farley?

319
00:18:41,745 --> 00:18:44,539
Mr. Munday,
Newton Creech here.

320
00:18:44,706 --> 00:18:48,292
Hi.
Yes sir, um,

321
00:18:48,460 --> 00:18:50,044
weII, I got
your letter.

322
00:18:50,212 --> 00:18:52,046
Yes you did.

323
00:18:52,214 --> 00:18:55,716
First off,
this Ginger Farley,

324
00:18:55,884 --> 00:18:58,845
how does she know
that l'm the father of the baby?

325
00:18:59,012 --> 00:19:01,139
l mean--

326
00:19:01,306 --> 00:19:02,974
weII, yeah,
how does she know?

327
00:19:03,142 --> 00:19:04,767
That's an easy question.

328
00:19:04,935 --> 00:19:06,602
According to Miss Farley,
she has had intercourse

329
00:19:06,770 --> 00:19:08,813
one time
in her entire life--

330
00:19:08,981 --> 00:19:12,024
with you, on February 1 1th
of this year.

331
00:19:12,192 --> 00:19:15,945
lt wasn't hard for her
to figure it out.

332
00:19:16,113 --> 00:19:19,073
Wow. Okay.

333
00:19:19,241 --> 00:19:21,117
Where did we meet,

334
00:19:21,285 --> 00:19:23,703
me and Miss Farley?

335
00:19:23,871 --> 00:19:25,997
Let's not
play games, Barry.

336
00:19:26,165 --> 00:19:28,374
lf you want to play games,
pIease, go hire a Iawyer.

337
00:19:28,542 --> 00:19:30,042
No, sir,
l'm not playing games.

338
00:19:30,210 --> 00:19:31,544
l just--

339
00:19:31,712 --> 00:19:34,672
Hey, just wanna make sure
the baby's mine, right?

340
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:38,926
Um, I mean, I'II take
a blood test voluntarily.

341
00:19:39,094 --> 00:19:40,720
Do you really have
no recollection

342
00:19:40,888 --> 00:19:42,889
of your sexual encounter
with Ginger FarIey?

343
00:19:43,056 --> 00:19:46,184
Because Mr. Munday,
l find that really hard to believe.

344
00:19:46,351 --> 00:19:49,520
Ah, so...

345
00:19:49,688 --> 00:19:51,564
could we meet,

346
00:19:51,732 --> 00:19:53,649
Ginger Farley and l?

347
00:19:53,817 --> 00:19:55,902
Maybe coffee, or pastry?

348
00:19:56,069 --> 00:19:58,988
Wow. You know
what l'm gonna do?

349
00:19:59,156 --> 00:20:01,032
I'm gonna teII Ginger
you'd like to meet her somewhere

350
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:03,367
and she can call you.
How's that?

351
00:20:03,535 --> 00:20:05,828
That'd be great.
Okay.

352
00:20:05,996 --> 00:20:08,706
You know, Mr. Munday,
they say one man's burden

353
00:20:08,874 --> 00:20:10,875
can be another man's happiness.

354
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:13,252
Thank you.

355
00:20:16,924 --> 00:20:19,800
lt's strange, l honestly can't explain

356
00:20:19,968 --> 00:20:22,720
why it only occurred
to me just now,

357
00:20:22,888 --> 00:20:25,056
l end with me.

358
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:26,557
No more Mundays.

359
00:20:26,725 --> 00:20:29,227
l'm it, the very last.

360
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:32,688
That thought rose slowly
to the surface of my mind,

361
00:20:32,856 --> 00:20:35,233
and on top
of everything else.

362
00:20:35,400 --> 00:20:38,569
l guess it never seemed
important before.

363
00:20:38,737 --> 00:20:41,405
Marriage?
No thank you.

364
00:20:41,573 --> 00:20:43,324
Children?
They smell,

365
00:20:43,492 --> 00:20:45,743
and grow up to hate you
and take your money.

366
00:20:45,911 --> 00:20:47,370
Sure, l grew up
without a father.

367
00:20:47,537 --> 00:20:50,957
Maybe that colored my outlook
on life, l don't know.

368
00:20:51,124 --> 00:20:54,085
All l know is
l once had options.

369
00:20:55,796 --> 00:20:57,672
My balls were great.

370
00:20:57,839 --> 00:20:59,715
l was great.

371
00:21:03,178 --> 00:21:04,845
l'm pretty sure
I was great.

372
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:14,438
Line 1 , a Ginger Farley.

373
00:21:15,983 --> 00:21:18,109
Good luck.

374
00:21:19,236 --> 00:21:20,903
What does that mean?

375
00:21:26,076 --> 00:21:28,077
Shee-ee...

376
00:21:37,296 --> 00:21:40,047
Why'd you want
to meet me, Barry?

377
00:21:40,215 --> 00:21:41,799
Ginger.

378
00:21:41,967 --> 00:21:43,592
lt's good to see you.

379
00:21:43,760 --> 00:21:44,969
ls it?

380
00:21:46,054 --> 00:21:48,014
Yes.

381
00:21:55,272 --> 00:21:57,982
This is familiar.

382
00:21:58,984 --> 00:22:00,901
This is where we met, Barry.

383
00:22:01,069 --> 00:22:02,987
Right over there.

384
00:22:06,825 --> 00:22:07,825
- You want to sit down?
- No.

385
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:09,410
Yeah.

386
00:22:09,578 --> 00:22:10,995
So, how far along
are you?

387
00:22:11,163 --> 00:22:14,040
Well, on February 1 1th,

388
00:22:14,207 --> 00:22:15,583
a few moments
before midnight,

389
00:22:15,751 --> 00:22:18,085
your little sperm army
stormed my pink beach.

390
00:22:18,253 --> 00:22:21,005
So, you count the days.

391
00:22:23,300 --> 00:22:26,052
Newton said you had
no memory of our sex.

392
00:22:26,219 --> 00:22:27,678
He did?

393
00:22:27,846 --> 00:22:29,513
What an asshole.

394
00:22:29,681 --> 00:22:31,182
Right.

395
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:34,352
No, you--
you're an asshole.

396
00:22:36,104 --> 00:22:39,357
Ginger, l don't
mean to offend,

397
00:22:39,524 --> 00:22:41,776
but are you totally,

398
00:22:41,943 --> 00:22:45,446
100%, absolutely,
positivo sure

399
00:22:45,614 --> 00:22:46,906
that the baby's mine?

400
00:22:47,074 --> 00:22:48,616
You little shit-eater.

401
00:22:48,784 --> 00:22:50,785
l am weak one night,

402
00:22:50,952 --> 00:22:54,330
one night, and with
a shit-eater like you.

403
00:22:54,498 --> 00:22:55,831
God knows why,

404
00:22:55,999 --> 00:22:57,249
and now you want
to sit here

405
00:22:57,417 --> 00:22:59,251
at Snatchers
and ask me crap?

406
00:22:59,419 --> 00:23:02,838
Yes, Barry, l'm "positivo"
the baby is yours.

407
00:23:03,006 --> 00:23:06,008
And you're not going to run away
from your responsibility.

408
00:23:07,469 --> 00:23:08,886
Do you mind
if l touch it?

409
00:23:09,054 --> 00:23:10,721
l don't know why l said that.

410
00:23:10,889 --> 00:23:12,264
Touch what?

411
00:23:12,432 --> 00:23:13,933
Your belly,

412
00:23:14,101 --> 00:23:15,684
touch where the baby is.

413
00:23:15,852 --> 00:23:17,186
Ooh!

414
00:23:17,354 --> 00:23:18,646
l'll have Newton call you,

415
00:23:18,814 --> 00:23:20,439
and he'll go over
the paternity test,

416
00:23:20,607 --> 00:23:22,358
and the paternity
acknowledgement forms.

417
00:23:22,526 --> 00:23:24,860
That is, if you decide
to sign them.

418
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:26,946
Goodbye, Barry.

419
00:23:27,114 --> 00:23:29,615

that you should be accountable
and take responsibiIity

456
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:12,987
for this little miracle
that we made?

457
00:26:13,154 --> 00:26:15,614
No, l'm saying l want to take
responsibility here.

458
00:26:15,782 --> 00:26:18,534

Shit-eater.

460
00:26:20,203 --> 00:26:21,870
Ginger, l'm saying
l want to be a part of this,

461
00:26:22,038 --> 00:26:23,998
like a real dad,
you know?

462
00:26:24,165 --> 00:26:26,500
With dedication--

463
00:26:26,668 --> 00:26:29,587
financially, spiritually, morally.

464
00:26:31,423 --> 00:26:33,591
Look, l don't have
to be in your life.

465
00:26:33,758 --> 00:26:35,926
You and l don't have
to be, you know...

466
00:26:36,094 --> 00:26:38,721
ahh...
but for the baby,

467
00:26:38,888 --> 00:26:41,181
l think we should be
friendIy, friends.

468
00:26:41,349 --> 00:26:43,475
Friends.

469
00:26:51,443 --> 00:26:53,110
Cheers.

470
00:26:55,822 --> 00:26:57,781
So, do we know
if it's a boy or a girl

471
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:01,160
from the x-ray?

472
00:27:01,328 --> 00:27:03,954
We call that a sonogram,
and no, l haven't found out.

473
00:27:04,122 --> 00:27:06,123
l don't want to know.

474
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:09,501
How's the drink?

475
00:27:09,669 --> 00:27:12,796
It's awfuI.
This straw is ridiculous.

476
00:27:15,383 --> 00:27:17,009
So, can l touch the baby?

477
00:27:17,177 --> 00:27:19,303
Can l touch
your belly now?

478
00:27:39,866 --> 00:27:41,909
Can l go to the doctor
with you?

479
00:27:44,245 --> 00:27:46,372
Don't get
the wrong idea, Barry.

480
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:48,457
You're still a shit-eater.

481
00:27:56,675 --> 00:27:58,092
Hey.

482
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:08,352
Green Insurance,
Barry Munday speaking.

483
00:28:21,282 --> 00:28:23,867
Why don't you ask her if you
can have a squirt?

484
00:28:25,578 --> 00:28:29,206
Ginger Farley?
Come on back.

485
00:28:31,751 --> 00:28:33,544
Yeah.

486
00:28:41,344 --> 00:28:44,555
So, don't ask me why,
but my parents want to meet you.

487
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:46,515
They want you to come
to dinner tomorrow night.

488
00:28:47,767 --> 00:28:48,976
Oh.

489
00:28:49,144 --> 00:28:51,520
It's stupid, so--
l mean, it's not my idea.

490
00:28:51,688 --> 00:28:53,355
lf you don't want to go,
I'II just teII them

491
00:28:53,523 --> 00:28:55,190
that you don't want to go
and that'll be the end of it.

492
00:28:55,358 --> 00:28:56,775
No, l'll go.

493
00:28:56,943 --> 00:28:59,236
My parents won't like you.

494
00:29:00,405 --> 00:29:01,572
Why not?

495
00:29:01,740 --> 00:29:04,241
They just won't.

496
00:29:05,577 --> 00:29:08,370
Knock-knock.

497
00:29:10,290 --> 00:29:12,082
- Hi.
- Hey, Ginger, how're we feeling?

498
00:29:12,250 --> 00:29:15,294
Well, my feet
are swollen,

499
00:29:15,462 --> 00:29:16,837
l pee 2,000 times a day,

500
00:29:17,005 --> 00:29:18,630
l haven't taken
a shit since Tuesday,

501
00:29:18,798 --> 00:29:22,301
and my nipples
are Iike bIack.

502
00:29:22,469 --> 00:29:26,346
Okay. Good, let's see here
what we have.

503
00:29:26,514 --> 00:29:29,308
Oh, we have a possibIe
due date of December 10th.

504
00:29:29,476 --> 00:29:30,809
Sweet.

505
00:29:30,977 --> 00:29:32,144
Yeah.

506
00:29:32,312 --> 00:29:34,480
So, you still thinking
of having the water birth at home?

507
00:29:34,647 --> 00:29:36,523
- Yeah.
- What's a water birth at home?

508
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:39,318
l want to have the baby
submerged in water,

509
00:29:39,486 --> 00:29:42,571
naturaIIy,
and beautifully.

510
00:29:42,739 --> 00:29:45,824
Do you mean like
in your tub?

511
00:29:45,992 --> 00:29:49,119
Actually, we use a little wading pool
with warm water.

512
00:29:49,287 --> 00:29:51,455
The midwife is in there
for natural childbirth.

513
00:29:51,623 --> 00:29:52,956
l think it's great.

514
00:29:53,124 --> 00:29:55,501
lt's beautiful, and Dr. Shriver
thinks it's great.

515
00:29:56,753 --> 00:29:58,212
Yeah, okay.

516
00:29:58,379 --> 00:29:59,630
Um, Dr. Shriver,

517
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,549
l'm Barry Munday.
I'm the father.

518
00:30:02,717 --> 00:30:05,594
l was-- basically,
l was just hoping

519
00:30:05,762 --> 00:30:07,805
l could ask a few questions,
if you don't mind.

520
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:09,932
Okay, ask away.

521
00:30:10,099 --> 00:30:11,558
AII right,
um , well,

522
00:30:11,726 --> 00:30:14,728
will l be allowed
to participate in the birth?

523
00:30:14,896 --> 00:30:18,482
l'd like to be there to help with
the baby when it comes out.

524
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:21,276
Absolutely. You and the midwife
wiII be side by side.

525
00:30:21,444 --> 00:30:22,986
Just listen to her,

526
00:30:23,154 --> 00:30:25,113
watch the videos,
and take the classes.

527
00:30:25,281 --> 00:30:26,990
Okay, awesome.

528
00:30:27,158 --> 00:30:29,827
Um, are there any foods
that Ginger shouldn't eat?

529
00:30:29,994 --> 00:30:33,497
l read somewhere that pregnant women
shouldn't eat bleu cheese.

530
00:30:33,665 --> 00:30:35,290
Are you retarded?

531
00:30:35,458 --> 00:30:37,543
l never heard the one
about the bleu cheese.

532
00:30:37,710 --> 00:30:42,172
l heard that
sometimes women poop,

533
00:30:42,340 --> 00:30:44,174
like during the birth.

534
00:30:44,342 --> 00:30:45,509
lt's natural.

535
00:30:52,684 --> 00:30:54,184
Um... oh!

536
00:30:54,352 --> 00:30:55,853
I read onIine
that it was possible

537
00:30:56,020 --> 00:30:59,064
for doctors to identiry patients
by their vaginas.

538
00:30:59,232 --> 00:31:01,567
Did you hear that?

539
00:31:01,734 --> 00:31:04,695
l was just curious.

540
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:06,113
Good luck to you, son.

541
00:31:06,281 --> 00:31:09,700
- Yeah, it's not important.
- No.

542
00:31:09,868 --> 00:31:12,286
Ginger,
l'll see you next week.

543
00:31:19,002 --> 00:31:20,460
Okay, well,

544
00:31:20,628 --> 00:31:22,713
l guess, uh--

545
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,048
So, tomorrow night.

546
00:31:25,216 --> 00:31:26,884
For what?

547
00:31:28,553 --> 00:31:30,470
Dinner
with my parents.

548
00:31:30,638 --> 00:31:31,972
- Right.
- Jesus!

549
00:31:32,140 --> 00:31:34,141
No--
it's awesome.

550
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:37,394
So, hey...

551
00:31:37,562 --> 00:31:39,396
Good night, Barry.

552
00:31:41,524 --> 00:31:45,402
That's cooI.
l'm really tired.

553
00:31:45,570 --> 00:31:47,404
Hi.

554
00:31:53,745 --> 00:31:55,412
Okay.

555
00:32:09,802 --> 00:32:11,303
This is our second child,

556
00:32:11,471 --> 00:32:13,138
and while my wife knows

557
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,098
that she won't fit
into her old clothes,

558
00:32:15,266 --> 00:32:17,100
she's still beautiful.

559
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,061
And it's my job to tell her

560
00:32:19,228 --> 00:32:22,606
that she looks amazing
all the time.

561
00:32:22,774 --> 00:32:24,650
Hi, beautiful.
Hi.

562
00:32:24,817 --> 00:32:28,862
Which I try to do
as regularly as possible.

563
00:32:41,292 --> 00:32:42,960
Hi.

564
00:32:45,797 --> 00:32:48,048
You're early.

565
00:33:06,067 --> 00:33:07,943
What?

566
00:33:08,111 --> 00:33:11,488
Uh, l don't want you
to take this the wrong way,

567
00:33:11,656 --> 00:33:15,867
but that dress
doesn't do you justice.

568
00:33:17,453 --> 00:33:19,287
That's interesting,
Barry.

569
00:33:19,455 --> 00:33:21,498
You didn't seem to have
a problem with this dress

570
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:24,668
the night you pulled it
off my body and had sex with me.

571
00:33:28,297 --> 00:33:30,882
So, I've been
kickin' around some names.

572
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:32,676
The baby
already has a name.

573
00:33:32,844 --> 00:33:34,594
What is it?

574
00:33:34,762 --> 00:33:36,346
lf it's a boy, Haywood.

575
00:33:36,514 --> 00:33:39,599
- Haywood?
- Mm-hmm.

576
00:33:40,768 --> 00:33:42,185
Haywood Munday?

577
00:33:42,353 --> 00:33:45,439
- Don't be stupid.
- What?

578
00:33:45,606 --> 00:33:47,190
The baby's last name
won't be Munday.

579
00:33:47,358 --> 00:33:48,942
Why not?

580
00:33:49,110 --> 00:33:50,861
Because we're not
married, idiot.

581
00:33:51,029 --> 00:33:52,863
l-l--
but l'm the father.

582
00:33:53,031 --> 00:33:56,116
- So?
- So--

583
00:33:56,284 --> 00:33:57,868
Come on,
l mean, l--

584
00:33:58,036 --> 00:33:59,786
l stepped up
to the responsibility.

585
00:33:59,954 --> 00:34:01,288
One trip to my doctor
to ask him

586
00:34:01,456 --> 00:34:03,874
about his other patients'
vaginas is not stepping up.

587
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,500
Yeah, but it's
our baby, right?

588
00:34:05,668 --> 00:34:07,711
lt's yours and mine,
right?

589
00:34:07,879 --> 00:34:10,380
I mean I'm here,
Ginger. l'm the father.

590
00:34:10,548 --> 00:34:12,799
Fine, fine!

591
00:34:12,967 --> 00:34:14,593
Fine.

592
00:34:14,761 --> 00:34:16,303
The baby won't have
a Iast name.

593
00:34:16,471 --> 00:34:18,263
lt'll just be Haywood.

594
00:34:18,431 --> 00:34:19,890
No, that--
just Haywood?

595
00:34:21,684 --> 00:34:23,769
l don't think you can do that
IegaIIy, can you?

596
00:34:23,936 --> 00:34:27,064
Why not? Lots of famous people
in history only have one name.

597
00:34:27,231 --> 00:34:28,565
Moses.

598
00:34:28,733 --> 00:34:30,233
Cleopatra.

599
00:34:30,401 --> 00:34:31,902
Calvin.

600
00:34:33,112 --> 00:34:36,364
- Who's Calvin?
- Jesus.

601
00:34:37,450 --> 00:34:39,326
So, if the baby
only gets one name,

602
00:34:39,494 --> 00:34:40,827
why do you get
to decide?

603
00:34:40,995 --> 00:34:43,789
Why?

604
00:34:43,956 --> 00:34:46,917
'Cause this baby's
in me, not you.

605
00:34:47,085 --> 00:34:50,170
Because every minute
l'm making a human being, not you.

606
00:34:50,338 --> 00:34:52,297
And because my tits
feel like two ziplock bags

607
00:34:52,465 --> 00:34:54,633
full of dried-up oatmeal.
Do yours?

608
00:34:54,801 --> 00:34:56,718
l don't think
it's fair

609
00:34:56,886 --> 00:34:58,762
to use my biological
disadvantages against me.

610
00:34:58,930 --> 00:35:00,931
You know l'd switch places
with you if l could.

611
00:35:02,350 --> 00:35:03,767
l would, seriously.

612
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,435
l go to work alone,
I sIeep aIone,

613
00:35:05,603 --> 00:35:07,562
but you get to experience
a connection to this baby

614
00:35:07,730 --> 00:35:09,689
l am completely
excIuded from.

615
00:35:16,906 --> 00:35:19,950
Just so you know, my parents think
that you put drugs in my drink

616
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,327
and had intercourse
with me while l was unconscious.

617
00:35:23,996 --> 00:35:26,164
Honey, well...

618
00:35:26,332 --> 00:35:27,833
This is for you.

619
00:35:34,465 --> 00:35:36,800
Come with me, son.

620
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:41,555
- l want you to see a few of these trophies.
- WonderfuI.

621
00:35:41,722 --> 00:35:45,600
- Who's this?
- This is our youngest, Jennifer.

622
00:35:47,019 --> 00:35:48,562
Any pictures of Ginger?

623
00:35:48,729 --> 00:35:50,564
Yeah...

624
00:35:50,731 --> 00:35:52,149
No.

625
00:35:52,316 --> 00:35:54,651
She doesn't
like pictures.

626
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:57,279
Sit down, son.

627
00:36:06,539 --> 00:36:08,540
So, Mr. Munday,

628
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:11,877
we've got ourselves a bit
of a situation here, don't we?

629
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:14,087
Yes, sir.
Um...

630
00:36:14,255 --> 00:36:17,674
I-- I'm not sure
what you've been told

631
00:36:17,842 --> 00:36:19,968
concerning my actions.

632
00:36:20,136 --> 00:36:21,428
Wait a minute.

633
00:36:21,596 --> 00:36:23,680
Did you not tell my daughter
that you wouId accept

634
00:36:23,848 --> 00:36:27,434
full responsibility for being
father of this baby, you shit-eater?

635
00:36:27,602 --> 00:36:30,687
- Yes, um--
- Financially, morally?

636
00:36:30,855 --> 00:36:33,481
- l--
- l'm sorry, but did you not say

637
00:36:33,649 --> 00:36:36,735
that aII these things
would be your actions, Mr. Munday?

638
00:36:36,903 --> 00:36:38,236
I thought
you-you were--

639
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:40,071
Nah, that's-- I thought
you were talking about--

640
00:36:40,239 --> 00:36:43,033
About what? Talking about what?
What are you taIking about?

641
00:36:44,744 --> 00:36:46,077
Uh, nothing.

642
00:36:46,245 --> 00:36:48,038
Nothing?

643
00:36:55,046 --> 00:36:59,257
Mr. Munday,
Ginger is hardheaded,

644
00:36:59,425 --> 00:37:02,385
and yes, unappreciative
at times

645
00:37:02,553 --> 00:37:04,846
of her family's love,

646
00:37:05,014 --> 00:37:08,767
but she is my daughter.

647
00:37:10,394 --> 00:37:11,561
Remember that.

648
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:12,938
Yes sir.

649
00:37:13,105 --> 00:37:14,272
Good.

650
00:37:17,693 --> 00:37:19,736
Oh, pumpkin farm!

651
00:37:21,906 --> 00:37:23,240
Dinner's ready.

652
00:37:23,407 --> 00:37:24,741
l expect you'll be
Iooking forward

653
00:37:24,909 --> 00:37:27,077
to continuing this
later on, Mr. Munday.

654
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:29,037
Yes sir.

655
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:32,666
So, you're Barry
the rapist.

656
00:37:32,833 --> 00:37:35,168
Tell us about yourself, Barry.

657
00:37:35,336 --> 00:37:36,878
This is the first time

658
00:37:37,046 --> 00:37:40,006
Ginger has ever
brought a man home to meet us.

659
00:37:40,174 --> 00:37:42,092
Our Jennifer brings
fellas home all the time.

660
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:43,510
But that's Jennifer.

661
00:37:43,678 --> 00:37:44,678
l'm a slut.

662
00:37:44,845 --> 00:37:46,263
You stop that.

663
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:47,931
She is not a slut.

664
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:49,766
She's graduating
from business school

665
00:37:49,934 --> 00:37:52,435
and she plays
three instruments.

666
00:37:52,603 --> 00:37:56,940
Jennifer is very
very special... ed.

667
00:37:57,942 --> 00:37:59,109
Ow.

668
00:38:01,821 --> 00:38:03,905
Personally, l think
this is nice for Ginger,

669
00:38:04,073 --> 00:38:07,158
even though l don't approve of the way
the two of you did your business.

670
00:38:07,326 --> 00:38:09,244
- Mom--
- l blame myself.

671
00:38:09,412 --> 00:38:12,247
I teII her it's not naturaI
to be by herself all the time.

672
00:38:12,415 --> 00:38:14,332
l've told her this
since she was 14,

673
00:38:14,500 --> 00:38:16,835
"You need to put on makeup,
nice dresses,

674
00:38:17,003 --> 00:38:18,420
show some pride,
Iike Jennifer."

675
00:38:18,587 --> 00:38:20,005
Leave her alone, Mom.

676
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:22,590
Let's ask Barry.

677
00:38:22,758 --> 00:38:24,801
You like makeup,
don't you?

678
00:38:24,969 --> 00:38:27,304
- l--
- She does it for attention.

679
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:29,139
- l can't believe this.
- Calm down.

680
00:38:29,307 --> 00:38:31,850
AII I'm saying is,
it's great to have Barry here.

681
00:38:32,018 --> 00:38:33,727
He gets that.

682
00:38:35,271 --> 00:38:36,980
l think Ginger's beautiful.

683
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:45,488
And personally,
as the father,

684
00:38:45,656 --> 00:38:47,449
l feel it's my role

685
00:38:47,616 --> 00:38:49,367
to tell her she looks
amazing all the time,

686
00:38:49,535 --> 00:38:51,453
which l try
to do regularly.

687
00:38:54,582 --> 00:38:57,000
So, Barry, um, you were

688
00:38:57,168 --> 00:38:59,085
teIIing my wife
about yourself.

689
00:38:59,253 --> 00:39:02,297
Oh, well, not much
to tell, really.

690
00:39:02,465 --> 00:39:05,216
l flirted with architecture
for a whiIe.

691
00:39:05,384 --> 00:39:08,011
l thought about getting
into triathlons,

692
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:09,512
or relay races.

693
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:11,723
Been in insurance--
about a year.

694
00:39:11,891 --> 00:39:13,516
Um...

695
00:39:13,684 --> 00:39:17,020
it's good.
lt's really good.

696
00:39:17,188 --> 00:39:20,982
- Where?
- lt's on Moorpark.

697
00:39:21,150 --> 00:39:23,234
Green lnsurance.

698
00:39:23,402 --> 00:39:25,153
Lonnie Green's
a great friend of mine.

699
00:39:25,321 --> 00:39:26,488
l'll call him,

700
00:39:26,655 --> 00:39:28,365
arrange to have lunch,
the three of us.

701
00:39:28,532 --> 00:39:29,824
That would be great.

702
00:39:29,992 --> 00:39:33,203
Get to know the new
father a little bit.

703
00:39:33,371 --> 00:39:36,039
That sounds good.

704
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,378
Well...

705
00:39:42,797 --> 00:39:44,881
we're gonna
have a baby.

706
00:39:50,221 --> 00:39:52,680
That's wonderful.

707
00:39:56,227 --> 00:39:58,061
Anyone like
a gin and tonic?

708
00:40:10,616 --> 00:40:12,784
So, where'd
you two meet?

709
00:40:14,036 --> 00:40:15,829
Snatchers.

710
00:40:17,623 --> 00:40:19,457
l see.

711
00:40:19,625 --> 00:40:21,918
l guess you knew Barry
before the operation.

712
00:40:22,086 --> 00:40:23,753
l guess so.

713
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:31,636
So, Ginger,
mother to mother,

714
00:40:31,804 --> 00:40:34,055
what is it that you want
for this baby?

715
00:40:35,141 --> 00:40:38,017
Besides healthy?

716
00:40:38,185 --> 00:40:40,937
l guess l just want
my chiId to feeI

717
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:43,773
loved and appreciated,

718
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:47,110
even if it's 180 degrees
different from me.

719
00:40:48,654 --> 00:40:51,865
l would be very proud
to have a gay chiId.

720
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,706
So, where are we having
this wonderful new addition?

721
00:40:59,874 --> 00:41:01,499
St. Joseph's?

722
00:41:01,667 --> 00:41:03,460
I'm having
a water birth at home.

723
00:41:03,627 --> 00:41:05,462
Uh-huh.
Uh-huh.

724
00:41:05,629 --> 00:41:07,505
Yeah, the doctor
thought it was a great idea.

725
00:41:07,673 --> 00:41:10,383
And it's natural
and beautiful.

726
00:41:10,551 --> 00:41:12,343
So...

727
00:41:12,511 --> 00:41:14,637
Well, l'd like to do whatever
l can to help out.

728
00:41:14,805 --> 00:41:16,806
You're gonna need
a baby bed, and bottles,

729
00:41:16,974 --> 00:41:19,184
and lots and lots
of diapers.

730
00:41:19,351 --> 00:41:20,685
That's great, Mom.
Thanks.

731
00:41:20,853 --> 00:41:23,730
l appreciate it, but my baby
won't be wearing diapers.

732
00:41:23,898 --> 00:41:25,356
l mean, why is it
we can teach a kitten

733
00:41:25,524 --> 00:41:27,650
just a few months old
to use a sandbox,

734
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:30,320
but a child,
infinitely more intelligent,

735
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:32,322
walks around shitting in their pants
for two years?

736
00:41:32,490 --> 00:41:34,991
Ginger read that.
This doctor-- what's his name?

737
00:41:35,159 --> 00:41:38,661
Plus, all the harmful
pathogens in human feces,

738
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,039
just smushed in there

739
00:41:41,207 --> 00:41:44,125
in that hot incubator
of a diaper.

740
00:41:47,713 --> 00:41:49,422
Ugh!

741
00:41:49,590 --> 00:41:51,799
She comes from
a really nice family--

742
00:41:51,967 --> 00:41:54,594
wealthy, nice house.

743
00:41:54,762 --> 00:41:56,387
Her sister pIays
three instruments.

744
00:41:56,555 --> 00:42:00,517
Honey, l don't care
if she's a Kennedy.

745
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:02,810
A cat box?

746
00:42:02,978 --> 00:42:05,188
She wants to train your baby
to use a cat box.

747
00:42:05,356 --> 00:42:06,940
Can you imagine?

748
00:42:08,526 --> 00:42:10,360
There she is!

749
00:42:10,528 --> 00:42:11,861
Where is your bathroom?

750
00:42:12,029 --> 00:42:13,321
Oh, go around
this corner

751
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,822
and through
the living room,

752
00:42:14,990 --> 00:42:18,243
just on your right,
past the zebra.

753
00:42:21,413 --> 00:42:23,873
A cat box.

754
00:42:28,796 --> 00:42:31,881
You want to maybe
tell me about this operation

755
00:42:32,049 --> 00:42:35,385
in case I get pIaced
in that situation again, "honey"?

756
00:42:38,430 --> 00:42:40,098
Um...

757
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:44,435
l went to a matinee
a few months ago,

758
00:42:44,603 --> 00:42:48,273
um... one second

759
00:42:48,440 --> 00:42:50,400
l was watching a movie...

760
00:42:50,568 --> 00:42:51,568
No!

761
00:42:51,735 --> 00:42:54,153
...and six hours later

762
00:42:54,321 --> 00:42:57,240
l woke up
in a hospital

763
00:42:57,408 --> 00:43:00,743
where they had removed
my testicles.

764
00:43:06,750 --> 00:43:08,960
What happened
in the matinee?

765
00:43:12,423 --> 00:43:14,340
l wish l knew.

766
00:43:14,508 --> 00:43:17,927
l actually have no memory
due to the trauma.

767
00:43:18,095 --> 00:43:20,680
Are you serious?

768
00:43:20,848 --> 00:43:24,350
WeII, the doctor said
it may come back eventually,

769
00:43:24,518 --> 00:43:26,185
um, maybe not,

770
00:43:26,353 --> 00:43:28,771
but l hope so.

771
00:43:30,149 --> 00:43:32,150
You have no testicles.

772
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:37,947
I don't know why
l never told you about--

773
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:41,993
about it before,
but with the baby,

774
00:43:42,161 --> 00:43:45,538
you being pregnant
was a real miracle

775
00:43:45,706 --> 00:43:47,040
in a lot of ways.

776
00:43:47,207 --> 00:43:50,460
- Shut up.
- No, come on, l'm serious.

777
00:43:50,628 --> 00:43:52,587
l don't know,
I just--

778
00:43:52,755 --> 00:43:54,714
you came,

779
00:43:54,882 --> 00:43:57,008
and there's
purpose now.

780
00:43:58,302 --> 00:43:59,927
Direction.

781
00:44:03,057 --> 00:44:04,766
- Morning, Hoss.
- Oh, hey.

782
00:44:04,933 --> 00:44:07,143
- Free for lunch?
- Uh, sure.

783
00:44:07,311 --> 00:44:10,146
Good, an old buddy of mine, Tom,
asked for you specifically.

784
00:44:10,314 --> 00:44:11,981
- Tom...?
- Tom Farley.

785
00:44:12,149 --> 00:44:13,650
Asked for my number one
shit-eater.

786
00:44:16,111 --> 00:44:18,363
Aw, man, l'd love to get a piece
of that business.

787
00:44:18,530 --> 00:44:20,073
How do you know Tom,
anyway?

788
00:44:20,240 --> 00:44:23,701
l'm, uh-- l'm friends
with his daughter.

789
00:44:27,164 --> 00:44:30,166
- Ah, Tom!
- Ah, Lon! How're you doin'?

790
00:44:30,334 --> 00:44:32,418
- Nice to see you, man!
- You look spectacular!

791
00:44:32,586 --> 00:44:33,961
You've
lost weight, man.

792
00:44:34,129 --> 00:44:36,047
You don't mind if my daughter
joins us, do you?

793
00:44:36,215 --> 00:44:37,674
l was downtown shopping, so--

794
00:44:37,841 --> 00:44:39,425
No no, not at all.
Nice to see you again.

795
00:44:39,593 --> 00:44:41,594
You too.
Hi, Barry.

796
00:44:41,762 --> 00:44:45,098
- Hi, Jennifer.
- Oh, l think our table's ready.

797
00:44:45,265 --> 00:44:48,518
Thank God, l thought you were talking
about the other daughter.

798
00:44:48,686 --> 00:44:50,186
- Menu, sir?
- Thank you.

799
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,355
Well, anyway,

800
00:44:52,523 --> 00:44:54,691
l'm really glad
we were able to do this,

801
00:44:54,858 --> 00:44:57,026
my old friend
and my...

802
00:44:59,029 --> 00:45:01,155
uh...

803
00:45:02,157 --> 00:45:03,908
Yeah, Barry
is quite a guy.

804
00:45:04,076 --> 00:45:06,411
Yeah.

805
00:45:08,080 --> 00:45:11,207
- So, what's good here?
- I'm a red sauce man, myseIf.

806
00:45:11,375 --> 00:45:12,375
- Best in town.
- Oh!

807
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,377
Hey-yy...

808
00:45:14,545 --> 00:45:16,713
Jen.

809
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,548
Hey, Barry.

810
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:28,558
The calamari gets good reviews.
Whitefish--

811
00:45:28,726 --> 00:45:31,185
my favorite
are the chops.

812
00:45:37,359 --> 00:45:39,986
- Specials somewhere.
- Ah.

813
00:45:41,613 --> 00:45:43,281
Hi, lover.

814
00:45:43,449 --> 00:45:46,743
So, this
your little kitty cat?

815
00:45:46,910 --> 00:45:51,122
Oh no, Lida. Look, this is not
the time or the place--

816
00:45:51,290 --> 00:45:52,749
Oof!

817
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:55,960
Gentlemen.

818
00:45:59,590 --> 00:46:01,132
Ooh.

819
00:46:01,300 --> 00:46:03,426
She's an old girlfriend.

820
00:46:06,597 --> 00:46:09,223
Before Ginger.
A long time ago.

821
00:46:10,934 --> 00:46:12,643
Ginger?

822
00:46:12,811 --> 00:46:14,937
My other daughter.

823
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,875
So, I heard you had
an interesting lunch yesterday.

824
00:46:38,504 --> 00:46:41,672
She's an old girlfriend.
She's crazy.

825
00:46:41,840 --> 00:46:43,800
What old girlfriend?

826
00:46:46,845 --> 00:46:48,930
They didn't--
l thought--

827
00:46:51,809 --> 00:46:55,061
I'm kidding.
Of course they told me.

828
00:46:55,229 --> 00:46:56,979
You're such an idiot.

829
00:46:58,482 --> 00:46:59,649
Why do you
do that--

830
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:02,068
all the "idiot,
shit-eater" stuff all the time?

831
00:47:02,236 --> 00:47:04,153
Oh, l'm sorry, Barry,

832
00:47:04,321 --> 00:47:06,364
am l hurting
your feelings?

833
00:47:08,325 --> 00:47:10,117
No, l mean, ahem--

834
00:47:10,285 --> 00:47:11,786
l'm trying to be nice.

835
00:47:13,455 --> 00:47:15,540
See, l can't win.
lt's like you constantly

836
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:17,375
expect me
to disappoint you.

837
00:47:17,543 --> 00:47:19,919
And why would l
expect that?

838
00:47:21,755 --> 00:47:23,381
All right,

839
00:47:23,549 --> 00:47:25,925
l'm an idiot shit-eater.

840
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:28,553
But for the record,
you should know

841
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:30,763
expectation

842
00:47:30,931 --> 00:47:33,474
is nothing but planned
resentment.

843
00:47:35,644 --> 00:47:39,021
Do you have that written
on a poster on the wall of your office?

844
00:47:40,148 --> 00:47:42,483
No, it's a book,

845
00:47:42,651 --> 00:47:44,902
a good book,
and l think it's true.

846
00:47:45,070 --> 00:47:46,946
And if you want to carry that around
with you aII the time,

847
00:47:47,114 --> 00:47:48,781
hey, that's your bag.

848
00:47:48,949 --> 00:47:51,617
But remember,
you called me.

849
00:47:51,785 --> 00:47:53,911
And l'm here.

850
00:47:58,250 --> 00:48:00,042
Whatever. lt doesn't matter.

851
00:48:00,210 --> 00:48:02,712
l don't blame you
for a goddamn thing.

852
00:48:05,132 --> 00:48:07,008
Well, l want it
to matter.

853
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:09,886
l want you to like me.

854
00:48:12,139 --> 00:48:14,891

Yes?

972
00:55:53,475 --> 00:55:57,186
Well, you just have

Yes.

975
00:56:04,110 --> 00:56:05,778
And you got to know
they're gonna shorten the name.

976
00:56:05,945 --> 00:56:08,072
They'll call her Corny.

977
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:12,076
She's a girI-- that's
what she'll be called.

978

00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:18,791
Yes l do.

980
00:56:22,128 --> 00:56:23,712

982
00:56:28,093 --> 00:56:29,968
What?

983
00:56:30,970 --> 00:56:33,055
Horny Corny.

984
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:36,016
That's what boys
like you will call her, not everybody.

985
00:56:36,184 --> 00:56:39,895
Maybe, but that'll
be her name.

986
00:56:40,063 --> 00:56:42,398
Look, l'm not gonna mold my life,
or my child's life

987
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:45,776
around the actions of perverts
and degenerates.

988
00:56:45,944 --> 00:56:47,736
l'm not afraid of the idiocy
of "Horny Corny"

989
00:56:47,904 --> 00:56:50,030
because it rhymes,
or because it's dirty,

990
00:56:50,198 --> 00:56:51,698
or because
people are too lazy

991
00:56:51,866 --> 00:56:54,159
to pronounce
her real name, Cornelia.

992
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:57,788
And by the way,
the next time

993
00:56:57,956 --> 00:56:59,289

without permission

994
00:56:59,457 --> 00:57:01,750

00:58:54,155 --> 00:58:56,365
- Jen.
- Oh, phtt-tt!

1034
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:59,701
Anyway, somebody just
comes into the theater

1035
00:58:59,869 --> 00:59:02,913
and... right
into his...

1036
00:59:04,082 --> 00:59:06,917
...you know,
his baIIs.

1037
00:59:08,545 --> 00:59:10,504

00:59:14,717 --> 00:59:17,386
Okay, Jen.

1041

Mr. and Mrs. Farley

1062
01:00:18,656 --> 01:00:20,490

01:04:59,687 --> 01:05:03,231

01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:05,567
l just wanted
to turn it off.

1145
01:05:09,238 --> 01:05:10,530
Thanks for
stayin' the night.

1146
01:05:10,698 --> 01:05:12,991
I know you had
your graduation.

1147
01:05:13,159 --> 01:05:15,827
Oh, it's just
a sheet of paper.

1148
01:05:15,995 --> 01:05:19,664
Yeah, well, Ginger appreciates it,
so congratulations.

1149
01:05:19,832 --> 01:05:22,584
You know, we've never had
much time alone together, Barry.

1150
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:24,586
- Why are you doing this?
- Does it stiII work?

1151
01:05:24,754 --> 01:05:27,255

- Relax, l'm a professional, remember?

1152
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:29,424
l knew it. Stop!
l knew it.

1153
01:05:29,592 --> 01:05:30,926
That was you
at the Beaver Tree.

1154
01:05:33,304 --> 01:05:35,889
What is it? ls it that
you just don't like me?

1155
01:05:36,057 --> 01:05:38,850
- Or are you jealous?
- No, please.

1156
01:05:39,018 --> 01:05:40,310
Of you?

1157
01:05:40,478 --> 01:05:42,354
l don't know.

1158
01:05:42,521 --> 01:05:44,856
Ginger?

1159
01:05:46,233 --> 01:05:47,567
Is it reaIIy
that boring being

1160
01:05:47,735 --> 01:05:49,486

aII the time?

1161
01:05:52,990 --> 01:05:54,741
What are you two doing up?

1162
01:05:57,328 --> 01:05:59,454
Look who l found

1163
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:02,415
Pervert.

1164
01:06:02,583 --> 01:06:04,250
Ugh.

1165
01:06:06,003 --> 01:06:07,712

01:06:19,600 --> 01:06:23,019
Okay, get a little--
a IittIe drink of water.

1167
01:06:23,187 --> 01:06:25,397
Vroom, vroom-vroom.

1168
01:06:26,482 --> 01:06:28,817
Sweet girl.

1169
01:06:28,985 --> 01:06:30,652
Right there.

1170
01:06:32,279 --> 01:06:34,364
lt's broken.

1171

01:06:36,325 --> 01:06:38,660
Oh, weII.

1173

You a daddy?

1174
01:06:40,705 --> 01:06:42,706
Yeah.

1175
01:06:42,873 --> 01:06:44,249
Fantastic.

1176
01:06:44,417 --> 01:06:45,750
Let's see
the little bugger.

1177
01:06:45,918 --> 01:06:47,502
Okay.

1178
01:06:48,587 --> 01:06:49,963
Now look at that--

1179
01:06:50,131 --> 01:06:51,548
half-Asian.

1180
01:06:51,716 --> 01:06:53,341
Uh, excuse me?

1181
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:56,845
Your baby.
Oriental, right?

1182
01:06:57,013 --> 01:06:58,555
Uh, l don't think so.

1183
01:07:00,057 --> 01:07:01,599
Been in this park
over 30 years,

1184
01:07:01,767 --> 01:07:05,228
seen every baby
from red to blue to Tyler too.

1185
01:07:05,396 --> 01:07:08,523
Eyes, hue of skin--

1186
01:07:08,691 --> 01:07:10,358
nothing like
Japanese skin.

1187
01:07:10,526 --> 01:07:12,235
Damn soft, too.

1188
01:07:12,403 --> 01:07:14,487
Velvet.

1189
01:07:14,655 --> 01:07:16,448
Mm-mm-mm...

1190
01:07:23,205 --> 01:07:26,458
Hey, man,
can l help you?

1191
01:07:26,625 --> 01:07:27,709
Sorry.

1192
01:07:27,877 --> 01:07:28,877
What?

1193
01:07:29,045 --> 01:07:30,211
Sorry.

1194
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:32,088
Why are you sorry?

1195
01:07:32,256 --> 01:07:35,091
- Sorry.
- Why are you s--

1196
01:07:51,358 --> 01:07:53,234
Mom, do you think
Cornelia looks like me?

1197
01:07:53,402 --> 01:07:55,195
Yes, l do.

1198
01:07:55,362 --> 01:07:56,988
Does she Iook
like my father?

1199
01:07:57,156 --> 01:07:59,282
No.
Neither do you.

1200
01:07:59,450 --> 01:08:01,284
l thought he was
an ugly man.

1201
01:08:01,452 --> 01:08:02,744
Why are you asking?

1202
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:04,579
l don't know.

1203
01:08:06,916 --> 01:08:08,541
Where'd he come from?

1204
01:08:10,211 --> 01:08:12,462
Your father came from
a place very far away,

1205
01:08:12,630 --> 01:08:14,214
and he should've
stayed there.

1206
01:08:14,381 --> 01:08:17,425
He Ieft behind the onIy part
of him worth knowing-- you.

1207
01:08:19,428 --> 01:08:22,055
Does my baby
look Asian to you?

1208
01:08:23,390 --> 01:08:25,475
This isn't about
Cornelia, is it?

1209
01:08:25,643 --> 01:08:27,519
- This is about your testes.
- What?

1210
01:08:27,686 --> 01:08:29,938
It's naturaI
after a loss like this

1211
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:32,607
to question,
"ls it real?

1212
01:08:32,775 --> 01:08:35,276
Did I actuaIIy make
this little creature?"

1213
01:08:35,444 --> 01:08:37,570
Questions are healthy.

1214
01:08:37,738 --> 01:08:40,406
l think that's the main reason
you had the paternity test.

1215
01:08:42,201 --> 01:08:45,954
Barry, God has
his ways, kiddo.

1216
01:08:47,498 --> 01:08:48,832
She is beautiful,
isn't she?

1217
01:08:48,999 --> 01:08:51,459
She's a Munday.

1218
01:08:51,627 --> 01:08:53,461
Cornelia...

1219
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:55,797
something-Munday.

1220
01:08:55,965 --> 01:08:57,048
Just Cornelia.

1221
01:08:58,050 --> 01:08:59,551
No middle name?

1222
01:08:59,718 --> 01:09:02,929
No middle name, no last name.
Just CorneIia.

1223
01:09:04,473 --> 01:09:06,391
You have to have a last name.
That's iIIegaI, isn't it?

1224
01:09:06,559 --> 01:09:09,811
What about Jesus,
Madonna, or Calvin?

1225
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,813
Who's Calvin?

1226
01:09:11,981 --> 01:09:14,274
l don't know.

1227
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:22,157
- What are you doing?
- Nothin'.

1228
01:09:22,324 --> 01:09:24,492
Fine.

1229
01:09:24,660 --> 01:09:28,496
Listen, CorneIia's sIeeping,
but you're gonna have to feed her soon.

1230
01:09:29,665 --> 01:09:31,166
Where are your glasses?

1231
01:09:31,333 --> 01:09:33,501
l got contacts
a month ago.

1232
01:09:33,669 --> 01:09:35,628
You haven't noticed?

1233
01:09:35,796 --> 01:09:38,464
Would you notice
if l had no head?

1234
01:09:38,632 --> 01:09:40,508
Probably.

1235
01:09:43,262 --> 01:09:46,514
See those guy's plants across the hall?
They're pretty sweet.

1236
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:48,892
My mom's number
is on the fridge.

1237
01:09:49,059 --> 01:09:50,852
Are you sure
you can handle this?

1238
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:52,687
Oh yeah.
We'll be fine.

1239
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:56,608
l got beer.

1240
01:09:56,775 --> 01:09:58,735
Are you okay?

1241
01:09:58,903 --> 01:10:00,570
l'm awesome.

1242
01:10:00,738 --> 01:10:02,697
Ugh.

1243
01:10:07,244 --> 01:10:08,703
Br-rr-rr.

1244
01:10:09,955 --> 01:10:10,955
Br-rr-rr.

1245
01:10:15,044 --> 01:10:18,046
- HeIIo?
- Barry, it's Mom. Could you come over?

1246
01:10:18,214 --> 01:10:19,631
Uh, now?

1247
01:10:19,798 --> 01:10:22,383
Just for an hour or so.
This damn disposaI.

1248
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:24,177
Uh, l'm watching
Cornelia, Mom.

1249
01:10:24,345 --> 01:10:27,263
Bring her. She should be visiting
her grandmother, you know.

1250
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:45,156
- HeIIo.
- Barry, hi.

1251
01:10:45,324 --> 01:10:46,908
l'm Dr. Preston Edwards.

1252
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:48,785
Please, don't be alarmed.

1253
01:10:48,953 --> 01:10:50,286
Your mother's concerned.

1254
01:10:50,454 --> 01:10:52,330
She loves you very much.

1255
01:10:52,498 --> 01:10:55,124
I thought
you had a bad disposal.

1256
01:10:55,292 --> 01:10:57,252
Barry, listen
to Dr. Edwards.

1257
01:10:57,419 --> 01:10:59,879
Oh!

1258
01:11:00,047 --> 01:11:01,547
Adorable.

1259
01:11:01,715 --> 01:11:04,759
Barry, our group
provides support

1260
01:11:04,927 --> 01:11:06,886
to help us understand
what has happened to us.

1261
01:11:07,054 --> 01:11:09,889
Boys? Each of the men
in this room has suffered

1262
01:11:10,057 --> 01:11:14,602
some kind of genital
mutilation or deformity.

1263
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:17,522
You're not alone.

1264
01:11:19,024 --> 01:11:21,609
Hi, l'm Jerry Sherman.

1265
01:11:21,777 --> 01:11:24,487
When I was
1 1 years old,

1266
01:11:24,655 --> 01:11:27,156


1267
01:11:27,324 --> 01:11:30,285
Now the end pokes out
like a little snappy turtle.

1268
01:11:30,452 --> 01:11:33,955
And yes,
l do urinate sitting down.

1269
01:11:34,123 --> 01:11:38,042
But you know what?
My testicles are intact.

1270
01:11:38,210 --> 01:11:40,795
So, I'd say
my glass is half full.

1271
01:11:42,214 --> 01:11:44,048
Well done, Jerry.

1272
01:11:48,053 --> 01:11:49,470
My name's
Kyle Pennington.

1273
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:52,807
l'm 37. l have a master's
degree in education.

1274
01:11:52,975 --> 01:11:55,601
My penis
is 16 inches long.

1275
01:11:58,230 --> 01:12:00,106
lt's thin like a rope,

1276
01:12:00,274 --> 01:12:02,817
and my testicIes
are the size of peanuts.

1277
01:12:08,991 --> 01:12:11,326
l suffer from a rare
genetic disorder

1278
01:12:11,493 --> 01:12:14,329
called Glassroth Syndrome.
l'm the founder of the group.

1279
01:12:14,496 --> 01:12:16,122
Thank you, Kyle.

1280
01:12:19,918 --> 01:12:22,170
lf you're laughing
out of nervousness

1281
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:24,672
or embarrassment,
that's understandable.

1282
01:12:24,840 --> 01:12:27,967
But there is nothing funny
about KyIe's condition.

1283
01:12:28,135 --> 01:12:30,511
l'm sorry, Kyle.

1284
01:12:32,848 --> 01:12:33,890
Ahem--

1285
01:12:35,976 --> 01:12:38,478
My name is Maury--
Maury Knox.

1286
01:12:38,645 --> 01:12:39,896
Maury is a new member.

1287
01:12:40,064 --> 01:12:42,106
He prefers to speak
with his back to the group.

1288
01:12:43,859 --> 01:12:46,819
l, um-- actually, l have
no genitalia at all.

1289
01:12:46,987 --> 01:12:49,906
My private spot is
a smooth hairless patch.

1290
01:12:50,074 --> 01:12:52,033
And l pee out of my a-anus.

1291
01:12:55,454 --> 01:12:57,830
This is my
second meeting.

1292
01:12:57,998 --> 01:12:59,832
Thank you, Maury.

1293
01:13:05,297 --> 01:13:06,422
Barry, I know this
must seem strange to you.

1294
01:13:06,590 --> 01:13:09,008
No.
No, it's totally--

1295
01:13:09,176 --> 01:13:10,551
it's cool.

1296
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:13,054
Came over with my baby
to my mom's house

1297
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:14,847
to help fix her disposal,

1298
01:13:15,015 --> 01:13:17,767
and l find five dudes

1299
01:13:17,935 --> 01:13:19,644
sitting in my living room

1300
01:13:19,812 --> 01:13:21,562
waiting to tell me stories
about their dicks.

1301
01:13:21,730 --> 01:13:23,356
lt's perfectly normal.

1302
01:13:23,524 --> 01:13:25,108
Okay.

1303
01:13:25,275 --> 01:13:27,693
Can l ask you a question,
Dr. Edwards?

1304
01:13:27,861 --> 01:13:30,905
You ever find people
who figure out their own problems

1305
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:34,409
without the heIp
of a support group?

1306
01:13:34,576 --> 01:13:37,662
Well, l have
patients who have

1307
01:13:37,830 --> 01:13:39,288
beIieved that
they have self-healed,

1308
01:13:39,456 --> 01:13:41,749
only to have their problems resurface
in acts of vioIence,

1309
01:13:41,917 --> 01:13:44,752
- estrangements, sexual confusion--
- Served it, sister.

1310
01:13:44,920 --> 01:13:46,754
Okay. Well hey,
l'm not violent,

1311
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:49,841
estranged or sexually confused,
so maybe l'm cured.

1312
01:13:50,008 --> 01:13:53,136
Ha, no one is
ever really cured.

1313
01:13:53,303 --> 01:13:56,264
That's nice, Doctor,
but my balls are gone.

1314
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,850
And I don't think
your group discussions

1315
01:13:59,017 --> 01:14:01,227
will help
bring them back.

1316
01:14:01,395 --> 01:14:03,604
I don't even know
if l want the damn things.

1317
01:14:03,772 --> 01:14:05,731
The only good they ever did was
help make Cornelia

1318
01:14:05,899 --> 01:14:07,942
and l don't even know
if they can honestly take credit for that.

1319
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:10,403
Thank you.

1320
01:14:10,571 --> 01:14:12,447
Mini-breakthrough.

1321
01:14:13,532 --> 01:14:15,032
You really should
join our group.

1322
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,160
lt's Thursday nights
at 7:00.

1323
01:14:17,327 --> 01:14:19,871
Jerry, are you
on refreshments this week?

1324
01:14:20,038 --> 01:14:22,165
- l'm makin' puff pastry, Doc.
- Good times.

1325
01:14:22,332 --> 01:14:24,625
Tell you what, why don't l just call you
when l'm feeling violent,

1326
01:14:24,793 --> 01:14:26,377
estranged, or--

1327
01:14:26,545 --> 01:14:28,171
Sexually
confused?

1328
01:14:29,465 --> 01:14:32,216
- Barry?
- Yes, Preston.

1329
01:14:33,427 --> 01:14:35,720
All right. Fellas?

1330
01:14:37,139 --> 01:14:38,514
Bye.

1331
01:14:45,481 --> 01:14:48,316
Oh, here's the one
I was Iooking for.

1332
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:52,028
This is Christmas.
You were four, l think.

1333
01:14:52,196 --> 01:14:54,989
Ah yes.
l was fat.

1334
01:14:56,658 --> 01:14:58,659
Look it, look it,
Iook it, Iook it.

1335
01:15:01,371 --> 01:15:04,665
Oh look.
Yeah, see, she's got your eyes.

1336
01:15:04,833 --> 01:15:06,918
She's got your nose.

1337
01:15:07,085 --> 01:15:09,003
She's got your toes.
Look!

1338
01:15:09,171 --> 01:15:10,963
Who has
anyone's toes?

1339
01:15:12,799 --> 01:15:15,259
Oh, you were
such a good baby.

1340
01:15:15,427 --> 01:15:17,720
You were always smiling
about something.

1341
01:15:17,888 --> 01:15:19,972
Look at this.

1342
01:15:20,140 --> 01:15:21,766
l never could figure out
what was so funny,

1343
01:15:21,934 --> 01:15:26,646
but you were always
smilin' about something or other.

1344
01:15:33,028 --> 01:15:36,239
You know, it never
bothered you that we were poor.

1345
01:15:36,406 --> 01:15:41,118
lt never bothered you
that we were alone.

1346
01:15:41,286 --> 01:15:43,579
l worried about you
so much

1347
01:15:43,747 --> 01:15:45,665


1348
01:15:47,543 --> 01:15:50,336
l really don't think you missed him
until you were older.

1349
01:15:50,504 --> 01:15:51,837
Hmm.

1350
01:15:52,005 --> 01:15:54,090
You know,
untiI you...

1351
01:15:54,258 --> 01:15:57,260
needed to ask questions
about--

1352
01:15:57,427 --> 01:15:59,470
you know,
being a man.

1353
01:15:59,638 --> 01:16:02,557
There wasn't
anybody there to ask.

1354
01:16:04,560 --> 01:16:07,270
Life goes in circles,
you know.

1355
01:16:10,482 --> 01:16:13,401
Ginger's
a good mother, Barry.

1356
01:16:13,569 --> 01:16:16,070
l want you to take care
of that baby.

1357
01:16:18,949 --> 01:16:21,909
Did he know
you were pregnant when he left?

1358
01:16:22,077 --> 01:16:26,247
Barry, if l tell you
he knew,

1359
01:16:26,415 --> 01:16:27,999
you'II make
yourself crazy

1360
01:16:28,166 --> 01:16:30,251
wondering why he left.
lf l say he didn't--

1361
01:16:30,419 --> 01:16:32,336
l just want
to know.

1362
01:16:36,091 --> 01:16:38,092
l just want to know
who I am.

1363
01:16:47,436 --> 01:16:51,439
Yeah.

1364
01:16:58,196 --> 01:17:01,324
Leaving behind a sperm
doesn't make you a father.

1365
01:17:01,491 --> 01:17:03,951
Or a man...

1366
01:17:04,953 --> 01:17:09,040
any more than one brick
makes a house.

1367
01:17:10,042 --> 01:17:11,792
l know that.

1368
01:17:11,960 --> 01:17:13,794
You've buiIt
your own house now.

1369
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:17,715
It's there,
the circles.

1370
01:17:21,637 --> 01:17:23,387
Before
you had Cornelia,

1371
01:17:23,555 --> 01:17:26,307
did you know there was love like this
in the whoIe wide worId?

1372
01:17:26,475 --> 01:17:29,477
Mm-um.

1373
01:17:32,272 --> 01:17:34,815
Another guy said
he pees out of his anus.

1374
01:17:42,949 --> 01:17:45,826
Now that's
just bragging.

1375
01:17:48,580 --> 01:17:51,666
Sometimes
you remind me

1376
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:55,044
of Joey from
the first season of "Friends."

1377
01:17:55,212 --> 01:17:57,213
Was he awesome?

1378
01:17:58,548 --> 01:18:02,218
No.
l mean, kind of.

1379
01:18:02,386 --> 01:18:06,013
l liked it.
l liked him on that.

1380
01:18:06,181 --> 01:18:09,058
He was funny.

1381
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:22,363
Were you really a virgin
before our sex?

1382
01:18:23,407 --> 01:18:25,825
Did you think
l was lying to you?

1383
01:18:27,285 --> 01:18:29,745
You don't remember
that night at aII?

1384
01:18:36,795 --> 01:18:39,046
That sucks.

1385
01:18:39,214 --> 01:18:40,965
Hey, why me?

1386
01:18:41,133 --> 01:18:42,508
l mean, that night,

1387
01:18:42,676 --> 01:18:45,386
why-- why with--

1388
01:18:45,554 --> 01:18:47,888
with me?

1389
01:18:51,727 --> 01:18:53,310
M-most of my life,

1390
01:18:53,478 --> 01:18:55,521
I think, you know,
people never really

1391
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:57,022
paid much
attention to me.

1392
01:18:57,190 --> 01:18:59,650
They kinda
just forgot about me.

1393
01:18:59,818 --> 01:19:02,403
l mean, they would think
like, "What's the point?"

1394
01:19:02,571 --> 01:19:06,824
Or they would just look at me and think,
"Why bother?" You know?

1395
01:19:06,992 --> 01:19:09,577
And peopIe
l work with,

1396
01:19:09,745 --> 01:19:12,037
my family,

1397
01:19:12,205 --> 01:19:15,332
and, um, so...

1398
01:19:15,500 --> 01:19:17,710
I don't know, I found
kind of a safety in that--

1399
01:19:17,878 --> 01:19:20,129
like, that there was
no judgment then.

1400
01:19:20,297 --> 01:19:22,798
No overt judgment.

1401
01:19:22,966 --> 01:19:25,342
You mean, you--

1402
01:19:25,510 --> 01:19:29,221
you dress like this
on purpose, and you know.

1403
01:19:29,389 --> 01:19:32,808
Well, l don't expect you
to understand it,

1404
01:19:32,976 --> 01:19:35,186
but there is
kind of a--

1405
01:19:35,353 --> 01:19:38,355
a power
in being...

1406
01:19:39,357 --> 01:19:41,108
undesirable.

1407
01:19:42,944 --> 01:19:46,489
But then l almost got
in this car accident that day--

1408
01:19:46,656 --> 01:19:48,449
the day of the night--

1409
01:19:48,617 --> 01:19:51,410
and this guy yelled
out his window...

1410
01:19:51,578 --> 01:19:53,871
Watch where you're going,
you ugIy bitch!

1411
01:19:54,039 --> 01:19:57,625
And, um, and it just
took it all away,

1412
01:19:57,793 --> 01:20:02,129
just that one sentence.
And l just felt really...

1413
01:20:02,297 --> 01:20:05,090
like an ugly bitch.

1414
01:20:10,138 --> 01:20:12,556

6:00 or 6:30.

1461

Your mom and l wanted to organize

01:24:18,428 --> 01:24:21,889

before my testicles vanished

1514
01:26:50,330 --> 01:26:51,663
l never stopped
to consider

1515
01:26:51,831 --> 01:26:54,082
whether she wouId be
a good mother for my child,

1516
01:26:54,250 --> 01:26:56,126

1519
01:27:02,258 --> 01:27:04,218

senseIessness,

1521
01:27:08,223 --> 01:27:09,932

for me to believe

1522
01:27:10,099 --> 01:27:12,226
l never would've
chosen this life.

1523
01:27:12,393 --> 01:27:14,603
And l sometimes think
of the days

1524
01:27:14,771 --> 01:27:18,565
l was buried in my cave,
feeIing sorry for myseIf,

1525
01:27:18,733 --> 01:27:20,901
Ietting my hand
drift between my legs

1526
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:23,695
to make sure
l wasn't dreaming.

1527
01:27:23,863 --> 01:27:26,990
But l also remember getting that letter
from Newton Creech

1528
01:27:27,158 --> 01:27:29,243
and reading
every word twice.

1529
01:27:29,410 --> 01:27:31,245

think about it,

1530
01:27:31,412 --> 01:27:34,164

poison the reaction,

1531
01:27:34,332 --> 01:27:36,041
l was overjoyed--

1532
01:27:36,209 --> 01:27:38,919
