1
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:27,270
MALLORY: Ella.

2
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:28,759
Mmm.

3
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:30,270
Hey!

4
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:33,798
ELLA: <i>Hi, sister.
Where are you?</i>

5
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:35,757
Taking the scenic route.
The long way, you <i>mean.</i>

6
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:38,078
I'm following my GPS.
It's fine.

7
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,594
It's beautiful, actually.

8
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:41,751
<i>This isn't what
I think it is, is it?</i>

9
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,114
No.

10
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:45,397
<i>As long as you're all right.</i>

11
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,400
Why wouldn't I be?

12
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:49,073
<i>What do you think?</i>

13
00:02:53,080 --> 00:02:54,912
Please tell me
that's not for the wedding.

14
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:56,593
Brad's mom will have
an aneurysm.

15
00:02:56,680 --> 00:02:57,715
<i>It's for tonight.</i>

16
00:02:57,960 --> 00:02:59,678
<i>Do you think it's too slutty
for a second date?</i>

17
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,830
Depends on whether or not
you've already slept with him.

18
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,718
Promise me that
whatever you do buy
for the wedding,

19
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:09,835
there'll be
a little bit more of it.

20
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,310
Hey, did you book
your flights yet?

21
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,435
<i>No.</i>

22
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:16,678
It's two weeks away.

23
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:20,032
<i>I know!
I was just waiting
for you to be sure.</i>

24
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:21,840
Sure about what?

25
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:24,517
<i>{just want you
to be happy, okay?</i>

26
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:26,759
I am happy.

27
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:29,074
I am.

28
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:32,919
<i>All right. ('H book
a refundable ticket.</i>

29
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:35,233
<i>Really?
I'm kidding. I'm kidding.</i>

30
00:03:35,320 --> 00:03:36,549
<i>Look at it this way.</i>

31
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,233
<i>Two weeks from now,
this will all be over,</i>

32
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:39,674
<i>and all you'll have
to worry about</i>

33
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:40,830
<i>is whether
four weeks in Europe</i>

34
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:43,514
<i>is really enough time
to see everything.</i>

35
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:48,118
<i>When will you get in?</i>

36
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,190
MALLORY: Uh...

37
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:52,955
About same time tomorrow,
if I go straight through.

38
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:55,511
Love you. Bye.
Bye.

39
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:13,589
BRAD: Hey, it's me.
 Uh, I guess you're stiff on the road.</i>

40
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,991
<i>{just wanted to check in,
see how you are.</i>

41
00:04:17,080 --> 00:04:19,549
<i>Look, honey,
I really appreciate you
going along with this,</i>

42
00:04:19,640 --> 00:04:20,869
<i>just like you always do.</i>

43
00:04:20,960 --> 00:04:22,439
<i>I mean, believe me,
I'm as bummed as you are</i>

44
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:23,919
<i>that! gotta cancel
our honeymoon,</i>

45
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:27,675
<i>but a huge deal's
come up at work and...</i>

46
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,515
<i>Anyway,</i>

47
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:33,036
<i>take care of my car for me
and I will make it
up to you, I promise.</i>

48
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,636
<i>We'll go somewhere better,
like Hawaii or somewhere
in a few months.</i>

49
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,477
<i>But right now
Fm just thinking
of our wedding,</i>

50
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:41,756
<i>and Pm waiting
for you here in Denver.</i>

51
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:44,438
<i>I know this keeps...</i>

52
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:23,315
Ella.

53
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,358
Shit.

54
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,073
Oh, shit.

55
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:30,875
Shit.

56
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,393
Fuck you, Brad.

57
00:07:52,880 --> 00:07:54,075
Nice.

58
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,070
MAN: Hi.

59
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:15,434
Fuck. Shit.

60
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:17,431
Sorry.
Oh, fuck.

61
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,435
Having some trouble?

62
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:24,510
Uh, no. I'm fine.

63
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:26,876
No. I meant with your truck.

64
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:28,752
Oh. Right.

65
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,035
Um...

66
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:32,311
Yeah, it just
kind of died on me.

67
00:08:32,400 --> 00:08:34,676
That's inconvenient.
Uh, want some help?

68
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,192
I tried calling AAA,
but there's no service.

69
00:08:38,280 --> 00:08:39,953
Well I... I'd offer to
let you borrow my phone,

70
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:41,834
but I don't have one.

71
00:08:42,480 --> 00:08:44,835
Oh, really? Um, okay.

72
00:08:45,160 --> 00:08:46,559
Well, why don't I
take a look,

73
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:47,995
see what we're
dealing with?

74
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,751
Long way from home.
Where you heading?

75
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:54,875
Denver.

76
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:58,754
When was the last time
you had her serviced?

77
00:08:58,840 --> 00:09:00,592
Oh, it's not my car.

78
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:02,273
No? You steal it?

79
00:09:02,960 --> 00:09:05,110
That depends.
Are you a cop?

80
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:09,469
Okay.

81
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,750
Oh.

82
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,436
Well. It doesn't seem
to be an oil problem.

83
00:09:17,520 --> 00:09:19,397
No, I, uh,
checked the oil.

84
00:09:19,480 --> 00:09:21,630
Uh, the belt is tight,

85
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:24,193
and I, uh,
saw the connection

86
00:09:24,280 --> 00:09:25,679
on the battery
is good, too, so.

87
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,679
Not making it easy for me
to save the day here.

88
00:09:31,960 --> 00:09:33,598
Sorry about that.

89
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:40,069
Have you been
walking a long way?

90
00:09:41,800 --> 00:09:44,155
I mean, do you live out here?

91
00:09:44,760 --> 00:09:47,434
No, I used to come
out here with my dad,

92
00:09:47,520 --> 00:09:49,830
and now I just come out
when I can and go hiking.

93
00:09:50,600 --> 00:09:52,193
Okay.
I still have one more move.

94
00:09:52,280 --> 00:09:53,793
Something my dad
taught me, actually.

95
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:56,429
Do you mind
if I check the trunk?

96
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:00,075
It's right here.

97
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,072
Turn the ignition like
you're turning it on.

98
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:05,150
Yeah, it's on.
Okay.

99
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,357
oh my gosh.
Yes!

100
00:10:16,840 --> 00:10:18,956
I am very impressed.

101
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:20,951
I don't know what
I would have done
without you, so...

102
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:22,838
No, don't mention it. Here.

103
00:10:22,920 --> 00:10:25,389
Can I... I mean,
can I give you money or...

104
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:28,472
No, listen.
Your thanks is
thanks enough, honestly.

105
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,359
And from the looks of it,
you're gonna need it
a lot more than I do

106
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:34,114
with a wedding
and a honeymoon to pay for.

107
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:35,429
So.

108
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:38,358
Well, um...

109
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:39,475
It was nice meeting you.

110
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:40,550
I'm Christian.

111
00:10:41,000 --> 00:10:42,035
Mallory.

112
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:44,270
Mallory.
That's a very pretty name.

113
00:10:45,320 --> 00:10:46,469
Um...

114
00:10:47,080 --> 00:10:48,115
Thank you.

115
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,520
Yeah, you got it.
Drive safe.

116
00:10:55,880 --> 00:10:57,279
L would offer
you a ride, but, uh...

117
00:10:57,360 --> 00:10:59,078
No, it's totally fine.

118
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:01,117
I got everything
I need right here.

119
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:02,679
Anyway, I get it.

120
00:11:02,760 --> 00:11:04,034
Thank you.

121
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,310
You sure about this?

122
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,119
I can only take you
as far as the highway,

123
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:49,793
but, yeah.

124
00:11:49,880 --> 00:11:50,915
Okay.

125
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:54,193
I'd have felt guilty
the rest of the drive.

126
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:55,953
Besides, you seem nice enough.

127
00:11:56,040 --> 00:11:57,314
You don't know me
that well yet.

128
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,432
I'll take my chances.

129
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:11,239
Do you mind?

130
00:12:11,320 --> 00:12:13,436
Signal's terrible,
but the CD works.

131
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,274
You can tell a lot
about people by
what they listen to.

132
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:21,798
CHRISTIAN: Oh.

133
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:23,870
Wow.

134
00:12:23,960 --> 00:12:25,394
Yeah, it's a mix.

135
00:12:25,520 --> 00:12:28,080
My sister made it for me.
Kind of to poke fun.

136
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:29,992
I don't know what you mean,
I love this song.

137
00:12:30,400 --> 00:12:31,913
Right? How can you not?

138
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:52,993
CHRISTIAN: She's back at home,
your sister?

139
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:55,510
She's finishing law school
back in San Francisco.

140
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:56,999
That must have been
tough to leave her.

141
00:12:58,000 --> 00:12:59,229
Yeah.

142
00:13:00,680 --> 00:13:01,829
She'll be all right.

143
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:04,993
She is the perpetually
single type.

144
00:13:05,080 --> 00:13:07,390
Different guy every month.
No ties.

145
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:09,550
Do you have her number?

146
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:11,670
Sure.

147
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:13,512
But then you'd have
to get a phone.

148
00:13:22,440 --> 00:13:27,310
Yeah, the thing she
didn't really realize
was that she was stuck.

149
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:32,234
After our parents passed away,
she was just... Sorry.

150
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:35,872
No, no. Don't be.
Feels like you
need to tell someone.

151
00:13:35,960 --> 00:13:37,792
Might as well be a stranger
you're never gonna see again.

152
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:41,034
What about you?

153
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:43,031
What about me?

154
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,519
You can't always
have been a hobo.

155
00:13:45,840 --> 00:13:47,069
No.

156
00:13:47,640 --> 00:13:49,631
Hey, where are you guys
going on your honeymoon?

157
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:50,835
Italy.

158
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:53,230
Brad's boss has a house there.

159
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:54,914
That's lucky.

160
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:56,789
Yeah.

161
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:00,675
Tell me about him.

162
00:14:00,840 --> 00:14:02,274
Brad?
Yeah.

163
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,079
He's great.

164
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:07,235
He's smart.
Interesting. Driven.

165
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:10,349
On our first date,
he rented out
the entire restaurant

166
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,954
and said he didn't want
anybody disturbing
our first chances

167
00:14:13,040 --> 00:14:15,077
of getting to
know each other. So.

168
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:17,318
He sounds like quite a guy.

169
00:14:17,400 --> 00:14:19,516
Yeah, it wasn't as lame
as that sounded.

170
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,558
No, I'd... Listen, it...
You wouldn't be here
if it was.

171
00:14:22,640 --> 00:14:25,154
Moving across the country.
Giving up everything
just to be with him.

172
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,269
You're almost rid of me.

173
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:36,393
Last chance to
get on the freeway
for about 50 miles.

174
00:14:36,840 --> 00:14:38,877
I never asked
where you were heading.

175
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:42,440
Next town over.

176
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,673
There's a little motel there.
Quiet, inexpensive.

177
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:49,029
As good a place as any
to spend the night.

178
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:54,593
Is it far?

179
00:14:57,440 --> 00:14:59,636
Not by car, no.
Why do you ask?

180
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:03,953
Just wondering.
Thinking I could use a break.

181
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:05,474
Maybe grab a bite to eat.

182
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:09,235
You don't need
to be on your way?

183
00:15:10,440 --> 00:15:11,635
Not yet.

184
00:15:19,840 --> 00:15:22,673
It's interesting, isn't it?
All this.

185
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:26,833
You driving through here
on this particular day
at that particular time.

186
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:28,433
Breaking down
right where you did.

187
00:15:30,520 --> 00:15:33,160
It's incredible, really,
when you think about it.

188
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,314
All the things that
have to occur in sequence,
all for two strangers to meet.

189
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:41,830
You know, you make
one different decision,

190
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:44,158
you take
a different fork in the road,

191
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:45,958
and then two people
just pass each other by.

192
00:15:46,080 --> 00:15:47,354
But yet, here we are.

193
00:15:53,320 --> 00:15:56,870
Is it all chance?
Simple serendipity?

194
00:15:56,960 --> 00:15:58,473
Or is it something more?

195
00:15:59,320 --> 00:16:01,118
Fate? Destiny?

196
00:16:06,920 --> 00:16:10,038
Don't worry.
I'm not flirting with you.
Honestly.

197
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:14,994
I don't think
you could deep throat
my huge cock anyway.

198
00:16:20,920 --> 00:16:22,797
I'm kidding.

199
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:25,510
It's not that big.
I think you could do it.

200
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:26,920
With that mouth,
I might even enjoy it.

201
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,559
That's not funny.

202
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:30,319
I think you should get out.

203
00:16:30,840 --> 00:16:33,150
What? Did I say
something wrong?
Did I spoil the mood?

204
00:16:33,480 --> 00:16:35,915
Please, uh,
I'm asking nicely.

205
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:39,635
Get out.

206
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:47,110
No,no,no,no,no.
We're gonna go on
a nice little drive.

207
00:16:47,200 --> 00:16:49,111
I can drive the rest
of the way on my own,

208
00:16:49,200 --> 00:16:50,349
but believe me
when I tell you,

209
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,795
it'd be a lot less
fun for both of us.

210
00:16:53,320 --> 00:16:54,993
The door, please.

211
00:17:05,240 --> 00:17:07,072
Why are you doing this?

212
00:17:08,280 --> 00:17:09,679
Doing what?

213
00:17:13,360 --> 00:17:17,115
I didn't force you to stop.
You pulled over
and invited me in.

214
00:17:17,200 --> 00:17:19,032
And even then,
even after you'd
done your good deed

215
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:22,551
and taken me
as far as you could,
you still wouldn't let me out.

216
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,917
Maybe that's some
subconscious attempt
to sabotage a marriage

217
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:28,719
you don't really want,
or maybe it's fate.

218
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:32,398
Either way,
it doesn't seem right
for you to blame me.

219
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,198
Gas pedal's
the one on the right.

220
00:17:54,200 --> 00:17:56,157
Where are you taking me?

221
00:17:56,560 --> 00:17:58,631
I told you.
A little motel down the road.

222
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:01,796
Don't worry, there won't be
anyone there to disturb us.

223
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:04,870
It's been abandoned for years.

224
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:09,995
Hmm?

225
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:12,393
Suit yourself.

226
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:18,235
We'll be there
before sundown.

227
00:18:49,760 --> 00:18:50,795
God, that's annoying.

228
00:18:57,480 --> 00:18:58,800
No! No!

229
00:19:45,080 --> 00:19:46,479
Ah, shit!

230
00:20:09,560 --> 00:20:10,595
Oh, shit!

231
00:20:24,200 --> 00:20:25,395
Oh, shit.

232
00:22:05,240 --> 00:22:07,072
CHRISTIAN: That was new.

233
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,673
I do believe I may ache
a little come the morning.

234
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,113
Awful lot of blood
you got there.

235
00:22:24,200 --> 00:22:26,510
I guess you missed
your femoral artery,

236
00:22:26,840 --> 00:22:28,797
because, frankly,
you'd be dead by now.

237
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:33,470
I don't think you realize
how much trouble you're in.

238
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:36,955
Nice knowing you, Mallory.

239
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:41,038
You're on your own now.

240
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:43,919
No, no, no.
Please, please. Please.

241
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:45,911
Please, please, don't.

242
00:22:49,840 --> 00:22:51,478
Where's my phone?

243
00:22:58,360 --> 00:22:59,919
Help!

244
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:02,391
Help!

245
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,158
Help!

246
00:23:13,000 --> 00:23:14,513
Help!

247
00:23:15,040 --> 00:23:17,509
Please, somebody!

248
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:21,357
Help!

249
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:31,639
Help!

250
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,517
Help, I'm down here!

251
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:37,359
Help!

252
00:23:38,800 --> 00:23:40,473
Somebody help!

253
00:23:41,720 --> 00:23:43,199
Help!

254
00:23:45,920 --> 00:23:47,718
Somebody, please!

255
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:52,474
Help!

256
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,353
Help!

257
00:23:57,120 --> 00:23:58,474
Help!

258
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:02,358
I'm down here!

259
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:35,790
Oh, shit!

260
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:02,954
Ugh!

261
00:29:39,320 --> 00:29:41,516
Don't you want to know
where I've been?

262
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:45,991
Found a cabin
a few miles downriver.
A family place.

263
00:29:47,880 --> 00:29:50,633
No one home,
unfortunately, and no phone.

264
00:29:51,240 --> 00:29:53,550
But by the looks of it,
someone will be back soon.

265
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:55,754
In the meantime...

266
00:29:57,960 --> 00:29:59,439
How have you been?

267
00:29:59,920 --> 00:30:01,354
Couldn't have been easy,

268
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,072
out here all alone.

269
00:30:08,720 --> 00:30:10,358
I gotta ask.

270
00:30:10,440 --> 00:30:11,919
Why'd you do it?

271
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,072
Drive off the road like that.
Must have had a reason.

272
00:30:18,480 --> 00:30:20,312
Did you think I was
gonna rape you?

273
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:24,152
You've been reading
too many stories, Mallory.

274
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:26,838
Let's be honest.

275
00:30:27,560 --> 00:30:30,154
If I wanted to get into
that little box of yours,

276
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:33,389
I wouldn't have
needed to rape you.
You were there.

277
00:30:34,440 --> 00:30:37,478
Ten miles and a smile
from following me
into a motel room.

278
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:39,039
You're wrong.

279
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:40,633
Am I?

280
00:30:49,120 --> 00:30:51,760
What's the matter?
Cat got your tongue?

281
00:30:52,840 --> 00:30:55,480
I need water. And food.

282
00:31:06,600 --> 00:31:07,954
What do you want?

283
00:31:11,720 --> 00:31:13,279
CHRISTIAN: Let's start with...

284
00:31:15,040 --> 00:31:16,633
A story.

285
00:31:17,840 --> 00:31:19,160
About what?

286
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,000
I don't know.

287
00:31:21,560 --> 00:31:23,631
How about the first time
you got fucked?

288
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:33,151
You have been fucked before,
haven't you?

289
00:31:37,160 --> 00:31:38,753
If you'd rather not...

290
00:31:40,480 --> 00:31:42,118
Wait! Wait!

291
00:31:43,600 --> 00:31:45,432
Theo.

292
00:31:45,520 --> 00:31:47,591
His name was Theo.

293
00:31:52,400 --> 00:31:53,959
Of course it was.

294
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:01,553
And, uh, where did you
meet this Theo?

295
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,554
On vacation.

296
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,310
When you were...

297
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:10,390
Seventeen.

298
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:15,231
Was it just the one night?

299
00:32:20,040 --> 00:32:21,713
And he was older?

300
00:32:24,840 --> 00:32:26,638
What'd he do to you?

301
00:32:33,720 --> 00:32:35,313
What do you think?

302
00:32:37,200 --> 00:32:38,474
Everything.

303
00:32:41,000 --> 00:32:42,911
And you liked it?

304
00:32:47,000 --> 00:32:48,877
Did he make you come?

305
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:54,518
How many times?

306
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,194
A lot.

307
00:33:01,160 --> 00:33:03,037
You still think about him?

308
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:13,000
Do you think about him
touching you?

309
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,790
About having him
inside of you?

310
00:33:24,520 --> 00:33:26,033
Yes.

311
00:33:29,520 --> 00:33:31,318
Do you touch yourself?

312
00:33:38,480 --> 00:33:39,754
Yes.

313
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:51,834
No, you don't.

314
00:33:52,560 --> 00:33:54,312
Nice try, though. Really.

315
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:55,629
You almost had me going.

316
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,916
It was Ella, wasn't it?

317
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,593
Theo, the guy.

318
00:34:00,680 --> 00:34:02,353
That was her story.

319
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:08,639
You should know
you can't fool me, Mallory.

320
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:13,956
Oh, boy.
No,no,no,no,
please, please!

321
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:16,750
Shit!

322
00:34:16,840 --> 00:34:19,275
You shouldn’t just
tell people what they
wanna hear, Mallory.

323
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,911
Try being yourself.

324
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:50,876
Help, I'm down here!

325
00:34:53,160 --> 00:34:54,389
Help!

326
00:34:58,040 --> 00:34:59,678
I'm here, somebody!

327
00:35:02,000 --> 00:35:03,195
Help!

328
00:35:18,360 --> 00:35:21,478
My name is Mallory Rutledge.

329
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:04,712
MAN:
<i>Kick back and unwind with
non-stop relaxing music...</i>

330
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:14,875
Last one, my fucking ass.

331
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:06,595
Shit!

332
00:38:25,880 --> 00:38:27,075
Fuck you.

333
00:40:02,760 --> 00:40:04,558
Okay. Okay.

334
00:41:42,320 --> 00:41:43,310
Ugh.

335
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,874
Fuck!

336
00:43:46,960 --> 00:43:48,439
CHRISTIAN: Morning, sunshine.

337
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:50,750
MALLORY: Shit.

338
00:43:50,840 --> 00:43:52,239
Beautiful day, isn't it?

339
00:43:52,920 --> 00:43:54,319
Hey, sorry it took me
so long to get back.

340
00:43:55,640 --> 00:43:58,029
Things got a little
crazy at the cabin.

341
00:43:58,120 --> 00:44:01,317
Bill and Sue finally
got back with their son
and granddaughter,

342
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,677
and I decided to
throw them an impromptu
welcome home party.

343
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:06,398
You know, I'd have
brought you some cake,

344
00:44:06,480 --> 00:44:08,437
but I didn't think
you'd like it much.

345
00:44:09,240 --> 00:44:12,631
Katie's a sweet kid,
but she isn't much
of a baker.

346
00:44:16,120 --> 00:44:17,315
Besides,

347
00:44:17,960 --> 00:44:19,155
looks like someone
had a party

348
00:44:19,240 --> 00:44:20,799
of their own last night.

349
00:44:30,640 --> 00:44:32,438
Still, you're learning.

350
00:44:33,360 --> 00:44:34,919
I'm proud of you.

351
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:37,831
You're starting to fight.

352
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,679
What's in it?

353
00:44:47,760 --> 00:44:49,194
This and that.

354
00:44:49,960 --> 00:44:53,032
You see,
I was doing a little work,
fixing that sign you hit.

355
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:56,397
Making sure no one else
would accidentally
end up down here.

356
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:59,274
Might be there's
something you can use.

357
00:45:06,000 --> 00:45:07,274
In that case...

358
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:13,275
Give me that, you bitch!

359
00:45:16,400 --> 00:45:17,390
No...

360
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,559
Oh, shit! No!
Let go!

361
00:45:19,640 --> 00:45:21,677
Get the fuck away from me!

362
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,077
God damn it!

363
00:45:24,840 --> 00:45:26,239
Fuck!

364
00:45:26,320 --> 00:45:28,391
No, Ella!

365
00:45:29,920 --> 00:45:31,752
Help, Ella!

366
00:45:32,080 --> 00:45:33,593
Ella!

367
00:45:34,200 --> 00:45:35,520
Help!

368
00:45:36,040 --> 00:45:37,269
You're too late.

369
00:45:37,360 --> 00:45:40,557
I already called the police.
They know where I am!

370
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:46,835
CHRISTIAN: No, you didn't.

371
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:51,593
That's not what
your phone says.

372
00:45:55,280 --> 00:45:57,476
MALORY: What are you
gonna do to me?
To you?

373
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:00,470
Nothing. Not yet, at least.

374
00:46:00,560 --> 00:46:04,190
For now,
I'm just enjoying the show.

375
00:46:04,280 --> 00:46:07,272
Please, just let me go.

376
00:46:07,360 --> 00:46:09,636
Now where would be
the fun in that?

377
00:46:09,720 --> 00:46:11,757
You don't get it,
do you, Mallory?

378
00:46:12,480 --> 00:46:14,596
No one is coming to save you.

379
00:46:14,680 --> 00:46:16,353
You're on your own.

380
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,671
If you want out,
you're gonna have
to get yourself out.

381
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:24,678
Now,
as much fun as this has been,
I really should be going.

382
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:26,639
Get back before my
hosts start to wonder

383
00:46:26,720 --> 00:46:28,233
who's been eating
their porridge.

384
00:46:28,760 --> 00:46:31,639
No, please! Please!

385
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:37,114
CHRISTIAN: I guess
I can give you
one more chance.

386
00:46:37,840 --> 00:46:40,514
All depends how far
you're willing to go.

387
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:43,030
And what you're willing to do.

388
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:44,315
Anything!

389
00:46:45,360 --> 00:46:46,794
Are you sure?

390
00:46:49,960 --> 00:46:51,633
Well, okay then.

391
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:02,837
Let's see what we have.

392
00:47:13,560 --> 00:47:16,074
Oh, my God. No.

393
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:30,151
What are you...
What are you gonna do?

394
00:47:30,680 --> 00:47:32,751
Me? Nothing.

395
00:47:33,200 --> 00:47:34,429
It's for you.

396
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,115
What?

397
00:47:37,080 --> 00:47:38,070
The...

398
00:47:39,600 --> 00:47:41,079
That's not gonna
cut through the door.

399
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:44,071
No, I don't expect it will.

400
00:47:47,960 --> 00:47:49,473
No. No, no, I can't.

401
00:47:49,560 --> 00:47:51,392
I can't do that.

402
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:54,159
Then you'll die here.

403
00:47:54,560 --> 00:47:56,471
Why are you like this?

404
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:01,675
What happened to you?

405
00:48:02,120 --> 00:48:03,918
What happened to you?

406
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,071
You must have
been a person once.

407
00:48:06,520 --> 00:48:08,079
You had a family.

408
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:09,389
A mother.

409
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:11,633
You had a sister.

410
00:48:12,520 --> 00:48:14,238
What would she think?

411
00:48:17,240 --> 00:48:20,278
Finding out who her
little baby brother is?

412
00:48:24,640 --> 00:48:26,392
Maybe... Maybe
you've already shown her.

413
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:28,760
Is that it?

414
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:31,558
Is that what happened?

415
00:48:35,640 --> 00:48:37,711
You found the photograph,
I take it.

416
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,154
That does look
a little like me, doesn't it?

417
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:46,800
It's amazing what you can
pick up at a garage sale.

418
00:48:47,880 --> 00:48:49,279
You're here for a reason,
Mallory.

419
00:48:49,360 --> 00:48:52,352
It's no more coincidence than
you and I meeting on the road.

420
00:48:52,440 --> 00:48:54,192
And there's only one way
you're gonna get out of this.

421
00:48:56,840 --> 00:48:58,592
You have to
accept responsibility.

422
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:00,432
Take things into
your own hands.

423
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:08,636
Now, I'd love to stay
and chat,

424
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:10,074
but I've gotta get going.

425
00:49:11,280 --> 00:49:13,590
But I will be back
to say goodnight.

426
00:49:13,880 --> 00:49:15,837
Assuming you're still here.

427
00:49:46,200 --> 00:49:48,794
Fuck! Shit!

428
00:49:51,240 --> 00:49:52,719
Fuck!

429
00:49:58,240 --> 00:49:59,674
Fuck.

430
00:50:02,360 --> 00:50:03,680
No.

431
00:50:06,520 --> 00:50:07,669
Fuck.

432
00:50:10,160 --> 00:50:11,514
Oh, shit.

433
00:52:11,040 --> 00:52:12,997

It's me.

446
00:54:30,600 --> 00:54:32,477
Did you actually try it?

447
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,039
Oh, Mallory. I didn't think
you had it in you.

448
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:41,831
Jesus, fuck!

449
00:55:42,800 --> 00:55:44,837
What are you smiling at?
Car keys.

450
00:55:46,720 --> 00:55:49,360
Really? That's your plan?

451
00:55:49,440 --> 00:55:51,909
Actually, I was planning
on cutting your throat first,

452
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:53,399
but I guess a girl
can't have everything.

453
00:55:53,480 --> 00:55:54,959
Ain't gonna do you any good.

454
00:55:57,320 --> 00:55:58,549

you're pretty clever.

The road's abandoned!

457

Is it?

458
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,957
That's not what I heard!

459
00:56:19,200 --> 00:56:20,838
You're gonna regret that,
I promise you.

460
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,718
Then what the fuck
are you waiting for?

461
00:56:23,080 --> 00:56:24,639

to call for a tow?

469

You know, I think I got it.

Are you sure?

471
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,752
Believe me, you don't
wanna be stuck out here
if this weather gets worse.

472
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,474
You bet.

473
00:57:33,360 --> 00:57:35,670
You wanna give it a try?
Just in case?

474
00:57:38,240 --> 00:57:39,230
I'll do that.

475
00:57:47,800 --> 00:57:48,915
Something the matter?

476
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,389
Would you believe
I locked my keys inside?

477
00:57:51,480 --> 00:57:53,517
It really ain't
your day, is it?

478
00:57:53,600 --> 00:57:54,954
Hey, you think
you can give me a ride?

479
00:57:55,560 --> 00:57:57,995
There's a spare set
in the cabin downriver.

480

481
00:58:00,320 --> 00:58:01,879
Yeah, you know Bill and Sue?

Sure. Sure. Yeah, hop in.
I'll take you.

01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:09,995
Fuck.

540
01:07:38,760 --> 01:07:40,034
WOMAN: Help!

541
01:08:15,440 --> 01:08:17,590
CHRISTIAN: You see,
my pa was a preacher.

542
01:08:19,960 --> 01:08:22,998
Any time I'd dare misbehave,
which wasn't that often,

543
01:08:24,000 --> 01:08:26,833
he'd take me out to the barn
and strap me up
just like this.

544
01:08:28,200 --> 01:08:29,873
He'd leave me there.

545
01:08:30,920 --> 01:08:33,355
All day, all night.

546
01:08:39,520 --> 01:08:42,433
You stopped to help me.
I didn't ask you to.

547
01:08:43,320 --> 01:08:46,199
Like I didn't ask
the family to invite me in.

548
01:08:46,880 --> 01:08:48,917
You got me into this.

549
01:08:52,240 --> 01:08:54,516
You made the choice to stop.

550
01:08:54,600 --> 01:08:56,591
You people go about your life
making these choices

551
01:08:56,680 --> 01:08:59,149
that you think
have no consequences.

552
01:08:59,240 --> 01:09:01,993
I'm here to show you
that they do.

553
01:09:05,360 --> 01:09:06,794
Well, Officer?

554
01:09:09,320 --> 01:09:10,913
Anything to say?

555
01:09:12,360 --> 01:09:14,920
Fuck you.

556
01:09:17,800 --> 01:09:18,835
That's more like it.

557
01:09:52,040 --> 01:09:53,792
Can I help you, ma'am?

558
01:09:59,720 --> 01:10:02,030
Having a little trouble
with your car, ma'am?

559
01:10:05,840 --> 01:10:08,150
License and registration,
please.

560
01:10:26,400 --> 01:10:28,676
License and registration,
please.

561
01:10:36,960 --> 01:10:38,997
Quiet, Katie.

562
01:10:42,320 --> 01:10:44,675
I told you to be
quiet down there.

563
01:10:52,200 --> 01:10:54,077
Good evening, ma'am.

564
01:10:54,160 --> 01:10:56,515
License and registration,
please.

565
01:11:00,360 --> 01:11:01,794
Be down in just a minute.

566
01:11:16,000 --> 01:11:17,070
Shh!

567
01:11:18,120 --> 01:11:19,474
It's okay, okay?

568
01:11:19,560 --> 01:11:20,994
He's upstairs.

569
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:24,030
Please, help me.

570
01:11:25,600 --> 01:11:26,590
It's okay, it's okay.

571
01:11:35,880 --> 01:11:37,075
KATIE: Hurry.

572
01:11:43,440 --> 01:11:45,317
Everything okay in here?

573
01:11:54,600 --> 01:11:56,193
Now, we've talked
about noise, haven't we?

574
01:11:58,160 --> 01:11:59,480
I thought we had
an understanding,

575
01:11:59,720 --> 01:12:01,950
but if we need to
discuss it some more,

576
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:04,877
I'm sure I can find
a needle and thread.

577
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:08,236
Don't you fucking touch her!

578
01:12:09,080 --> 01:12:11,117
You move, you breathe,
you're dead.

579
01:12:18,440 --> 01:12:19,714
Get off!

580
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:21,830
Katie, run!

581
01:12:24,040 --> 01:12:25,075
Ow!

582
01:12:26,440 --> 01:12:27,953
MALLORY: Run!

583
01:12:31,240 --> 01:12:32,674
CHRISTIAN: Mallory?

584
01:12:37,320 --> 01:12:38,799
Mallory?

585
01:12:41,000 --> 01:12:42,593
Mallory?

586
01:12:44,840 --> 01:12:46,513
You really are
full of surprises.

587
01:12:53,560 --> 01:12:56,120
Been a long time since
I've had so much fun.

588
01:12:56,200 --> 01:12:58,919
Really, I ought to
thank you for that.

589
01:13:01,480 --> 01:13:05,269
lam curious, though,
how you managed to get out.

590
01:13:09,240 --> 01:13:12,631
I thought you were
gonna die in there.
One way or another.

591
01:13:15,720 --> 01:13:18,439
Perhaps this was how
it was meant to be.

592
01:13:20,040 --> 01:13:21,075
Boo!

593
01:13:21,960 --> 01:13:22,950
MALLORY: No!

594
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,359
Get the fuck away from me!

595
01:13:26,440 --> 01:13:28,351
Can't run from fate,
Mallory.

596
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:32,194
Oh, shit! No!

597
01:13:34,280 --> 01:13:36,032
No matter
how hard you try.

598
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:40,354
Almost!

599
01:13:41,160 --> 01:13:42,309
Get the fuck away from me!

600
01:13:45,160 --> 01:13:47,037
This was how
I hoped it would end.

601
01:13:47,120 --> 01:13:49,236
I always knew it
would happen this way.

602
01:13:49,320 --> 01:13:51,675
Does this feel like
your destiny now?

603
01:13:58,800 --> 01:13:59,835
Argh!

604
01:14:24,880 --> 01:14:25,950
Mallory.

605
01:14:26,760 --> 01:14:28,637
I know you're out there.

606
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:41,439
Fuck!

607
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:45,390
CHRISTIAN: Fuck!

608
01:14:45,480 --> 01:14:46,470
It's okay.

609
01:14:53,520 --> 01:14:55,193
That looks painful.

610
01:14:56,040 --> 01:14:57,678
You need some help?

611
01:15:04,400 --> 01:15:08,189
Now, now,
I don't think you realize
how much trouble you're in.

612
01:15:10,360 --> 01:15:12,033
That's an awful
lot of blood.

613
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:16,677
I'm guessing you missed
your femoral artery,

614
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,636
because, frankly,
you'd be dead
by now if you hadn't.

615
01:15:19,720 --> 01:15:20,790
Fuck you.

616
01:15:20,880 --> 01:15:22,791
But God knows what other
damage you've done.

617
01:15:27,920 --> 01:15:29,797
Doesn't look good.

618
01:15:39,000 --> 01:15:40,752
Now, I'd love to
stay and chat,

619
01:15:40,840 --> 01:15:42,513
but I gotta get going.

620
01:15:43,080 --> 01:15:45,356
I wouldn't want you to think
that I was being unfair.

621
01:15:45,440 --> 01:15:48,193
So I'm gonna give you
the same chance
that you gave me.

622
01:15:55,960 --> 01:15:58,634
I've been thinking a lot
about what you said.

623
01:15:58,720 --> 01:16:00,199
About fate.

624
01:16:04,240 --> 01:16:05,958
Maybe you were right.

625
01:16:06,960 --> 01:16:09,349
Maybe it was
supposed to be like this.

626
01:16:13,080 --> 01:16:16,755
Maybe you just got in
the wrong fucking car!

627
01:16:34,520 --> 01:16:35,954
MALLORY: It's okay.

628
01:16:36,720 --> 01:16:38,438
It's over. It's over.

629
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:41,318
You're gonna be okay.
