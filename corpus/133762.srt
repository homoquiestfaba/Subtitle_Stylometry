1
00:01:17,177 --> 00:01:19,168
Hey, Sheriff.

2
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:28,811
("Chair scraping on floor)

3
00:02:29,282 --> 00:02:33,412
A Mercury is a real good car.

4
00:02:33,486 --> 00:02:36,683
That was the car I was driving that day.

5
00:02:39,692 --> 00:02:42,024
I have a lot of cars.

6
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:45,361
Yeah. Different kinds.

7
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:49,261
A lot of different kinds of cars.

8
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,305
She was standing, this girl,

9
00:02:54,307 --> 00:02:56,537
on the side of the street
where there was this chicken stand.

10
00:02:56,609 --> 00:02:58,941
It wasn't the Colonel,
but it was a chicken stand nevertheless.

11
00:02:59,012 --> 00:03:01,981
And I pulled the Mercury right up alongside

12
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:05,484
and I rolled down the window,
see, by electric power.

13
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:09,716
And she had this leather skirt on.

14
00:03:09,789 --> 00:03:12,781
And she had a lot of hair on her arms.

15
00:03:12,859 --> 00:03:18,855
I like hair, I like hair a lot.
It means a big bush. I like a big bush.

16
00:03:19,732 --> 00:03:24,829
So she says, "Are you dating?" You know?

17
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:27,099
I said, "Sure." So she gets in.

18
00:03:27,173 --> 00:03:32,440
And we pull off
into this remote location, you know,

19
00:03:32,512 --> 00:03:34,776
that was comfortable for both she and I.

20
00:03:34,847 --> 00:03:38,214
And she says to me,
"How much do you wanna spend?"

21
00:03:38,284 --> 00:03:41,913
And I said, "Whatever it takes to see that
bush of yours, 'cause I know it's a big one."

22
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:44,980
And she says to me, "25 dollars."

23
00:03:47,093 --> 00:03:52,030
That's not chicken feed, you know...
to a working man.

24
00:03:52,098 --> 00:03:57,434
So I produce the 25 dollars and she sticks
it down into her shoe and pulls up her skirt.

25
00:03:57,503 --> 00:04:00,904
And there before me lay this thin,

26
00:04:00,974 --> 00:04:03,966
crooked, uncircumcised penis.

27
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:13,585
You can imagine how bad
I wanted my 25 dollars back, huh?

28
00:04:17,123 --> 00:04:20,718
("Girl) I don't know why you're
so weirded out. This is not San Quentin.

29
00:04:20,793 --> 00:04:23,489
It's just a nut house. Most of these people
don't even know where they are.

30
00:04:23,563 --> 00:04:25,053
They're not gonna hurt you.

31
00:04:25,131 --> 00:04:28,294
In a few minutes, we're gonna be in a room
with a killer. That doesn't bother you?

32
00:04:28,368 --> 00:04:30,996
Hey, you're the one
that wanted to major in journalism.

33
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:38,570
These are the people
from that newspaper deal.

34
00:04:38,645 --> 00:04:41,136
- Oh, yeah. From the college?
- Yes, sir.

35
00:04:41,214 --> 00:04:43,205
- I'm Jerry Woolridge.
- Nice to meet you.

36
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:45,649
I'm Marsha Dwiggins
and this is Theresa Evans.

37
00:04:45,718 --> 00:04:48,448
She's here to take the pictures.

38
00:04:48,521 --> 00:04:50,853
Y'all sit down.

39
00:04:51,891 --> 00:04:54,121
Yeah, there was a young man
named John Legit Hunter

40
00:04:54,193 --> 00:04:56,957
who was in the filling station business -
a good filling station business.

41
00:04:57,030 --> 00:04:59,362
But he was one of these young men
we run across in life,

42
00:04:59,432 --> 00:05:02,833
I'm sure you've run across 'em, who didn't
deserve what he had, you know?

43
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:07,202
And one of the things he had was this...

44
00:05:07,273 --> 00:05:09,264
beautiful young bride,

45
00:05:09,342 --> 00:05:12,106
Sarah.

46
00:05:12,178 --> 00:05:14,078
She was a Georgia peach.

47
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:19,949
In fact, she was more like the picture I had
in my mind than any woman I'd ever seen.

48
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:23,477
So I took it upon myself
to take her away from John Legit Hunter,

49
00:05:23,556 --> 00:05:26,457
who did not deserve her, you know?

50
00:05:26,526 --> 00:05:29,620
Oh, I don't know if I told you,

51
00:05:29,696 --> 00:05:34,258
but he was a Frenchman
who claimed to be an Englishman.

52
00:05:36,602 --> 00:05:39,662
Yeah... Took a lot of strong nylon cord
to get her away from him,

53
00:05:39,739 --> 00:05:44,472
'cause she was a fighter
as well as being a Georgia peach.

54
00:05:46,946 --> 00:05:50,939
I think there must have been a little mix-up.

55
00:05:51,017 --> 00:05:53,986
I talked to your sponsor or teacher,
or whoever he is,

56
00:05:54,053 --> 00:05:57,489
and I told him that
there couldn't be any pictures.

57
00:05:57,557 --> 00:06:02,961
It's supposed to be like an article or a
story, something like that, isn't that right?

58
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:06,362
Well, yeah, it's for the school newspaper,
but it has pictures.

59
00:06:06,432 --> 00:06:08,764
I mean, it's a regular paper, you know?

60
00:06:08,835 --> 00:06:11,360
Karl's real sensitive
about having his picture made.

61
00:06:11,437 --> 00:06:14,873
He wouldn't even be on the bulletin board
for the Easter collage.

62
00:06:18,077 --> 00:06:20,841
Now...

63
00:06:20,913 --> 00:06:24,508
a shovel just makes
too goddamn much racket.

64
00:06:33,159 --> 00:06:36,856
All I can do is talk to him,
see what he says.

65
00:06:38,431 --> 00:06:40,922
You gotta make something explode
to truly understand it.

66
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:46,996
I mean, you gotta examine all those little
tiny particles while they're still on fire.

67
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:50,065
("Guard) Karl, I've gotta take you
down to the old classroom.

68
00:06:50,143 --> 00:06:55,046
Mr. Woolridge has some people
for you to see down there.

69
00:06:55,114 --> 00:06:57,275
Come on, let's go.

70
00:07:15,468 --> 00:07:18,995
You remember me telling you
about those people from that newspaper?

71
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:22,199
They wanna ask you some questions
about your release.

72
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,108
They think it'll make a good story.

73
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:28,375
Will you talk to 'em?
Get interviewed?

74
00:07:30,249 --> 00:07:32,376
- Now, they're women.
- ("Guard snorts.)

75
00:07:35,488 --> 00:07:38,480
I think it'd be good for you, too.
You're gonna be seeing all kinds of people

76
00:07:38,558 --> 00:07:40,890
when you get on the outside.

77
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:43,292
This'll help, I believe.

78
00:07:49,969 --> 00:07:53,097
Now, here's the thing.
He'll only talk to you,

79
00:07:53,172 --> 00:07:55,299
but he doesn't want
you to ask him anything.

80
00:07:55,374 --> 00:07:57,365
And you really shouldn't stare at him.

81
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,877
How am I going to conduct an interview
if I can't ask him any questions?

82
00:07:59,946 --> 00:08:02,244
It's the best it's gonna get. I'm sorry.

83
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:07,378
Can I ask you a question? If he's so
troubled, why are you letting him out?

84
00:08:07,453 --> 00:08:10,183
What if he does it again?
It happens all the time.

85
00:08:10,256 --> 00:08:12,952
He's free, his time's up.
That's the rules.

86
00:08:13,025 --> 00:08:16,620
He's been treated and reevaluated
and doesn't show any signs anymore.

87
00:08:16,696 --> 00:08:19,426
- Signs?
- Homicidal signs.

88
00:08:19,499 --> 00:08:24,698
Oh, Miss. I'm sorry,
but you're gonna have to step outside.

89
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:26,601
Why?

90
00:08:26,672 --> 00:08:28,503
Please?

91
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:40,751
I gotta change the light in here for Karl.

92
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:43,516
I hope you can still see to write.

93
00:09:24,697 --> 00:09:28,861
I reckon what you is wanting to know
is what I'm a-doin' in here.

94
00:09:28,935 --> 00:09:34,134
I reckon the reason I'm in here
is 'cause I've killed somebody. Mm-hm.

95
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:37,835
But I reckon what you is a-wantin' to know
is how come me to kill somebody,

96
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:41,744
so I reckon I'll start at the front and tell you.

97
00:09:43,716 --> 00:09:48,710
I lived out the back of my mother
and father's place most of my life,

98
00:09:48,788 --> 00:09:52,554
in a little old shed
that my daddy had built for me.

99
00:09:52,625 --> 00:09:56,959
They didn't too much want me
up there in the house with the rest of 'em.

100
00:09:57,029 --> 00:10:02,661
So mostly, I just sat around out there
in the shed, a-lookin' at the ground.

101
00:10:02,735 --> 00:10:05,636
I didn't have no floor out there.

102
00:10:05,705 --> 00:10:09,869
But I had me a hole dug out to lay down in.

103
00:10:09,942 --> 00:10:12,934
A quilt or two to put down there. Mm-hm.

104
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:20,576
My father was a hardworking man
most of his life.

105
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:24,282
Not that I can say the same for myself.

106
00:10:24,357 --> 00:10:26,723
I mostly just sat around
out there in the shed,

107
00:10:26,792 --> 00:10:30,057
tinkered around with a lawn mower or two.

108
00:10:30,129 --> 00:10:33,792
Went to school off and on
from time to time.

109
00:10:33,866 --> 00:10:39,099
But the children out there,
they were very cruel to me.

110
00:10:39,171 --> 00:10:43,608
Made quite a bit of sport of me.
Made fun of me quite a bit.

111
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:49,342
So mostly, I just sat around
out there in the shed.

112
00:10:52,652 --> 00:10:56,679
My daddy worked down there
at the saw mill,

113
00:10:56,756 --> 00:11:00,658
down at the planer mill
for an old man named Dixon.

114
00:11:00,726 --> 00:11:03,251
Old man Dixon was a very cruel fella.

115
00:11:03,329 --> 00:11:06,765
Didn't treat his employees very well.
Didn't pay 'em too much of a wage.

116
00:11:06,832 --> 00:11:09,665
Didn't pay my daddy too much of a wage.

117
00:11:09,735 --> 00:11:13,501
Just barely enough to get by on, I reckon.

118
00:11:13,572 --> 00:11:16,234
But I reckon he got by all right.

119
00:11:18,744 --> 00:11:22,612
They used to come out,
one or the other of 'em,

120
00:11:22,682 --> 00:11:24,877
usually my mother,

121
00:11:24,950 --> 00:11:27,214
feed me pretty regular.

122
00:11:28,220 --> 00:11:30,279
Though I know he made enough
to where I could have

123
00:11:30,356 --> 00:11:34,224
mustard and biscuits
three or four times a week.

124
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:40,859
But old man Dixon, he had a boy.

125
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:45,532
His name was Jesse Dixon.

126
00:11:45,604 --> 00:11:49,335
Jesse was really more cruel
than his daddy was.

127
00:11:49,408 --> 00:11:55,404
He used to make quite a bit of sport of me
when I was down there at the schoolhouse.

128
00:11:58,150 --> 00:12:04,146
He used to take advantage of little girls
there in the neighborhood an' all.

129
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:11,092
He used to say that my mother
was a very pretty woman.

130
00:12:11,163 --> 00:12:16,430
He said that quite a bit from time to time
when I'd be down there at the schoolhouse.

131
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,470
Well...

132
00:12:18,537 --> 00:12:21,563
I reckon you want me to get on with it
and tell you what happened,

133
00:12:21,640 --> 00:12:23,870
so I reckon I'll tell you.

134
00:12:24,877 --> 00:12:28,244
I was sittin' out there in the shed one
evening, not doing too much of nothing,

135
00:12:28,314 --> 00:12:30,976
just kinda staring at the wall,

136
00:12:31,050 --> 00:12:35,987
waiting on my mother to come out
and give me my Bible lesson.

137
00:12:37,423 --> 00:12:41,052
Well, I heard a commotion
up there in the house.

138
00:12:41,127 --> 00:12:44,824
So I run up on the screened-in porch
to see what was a-goin' on.

139
00:12:44,897 --> 00:12:47,764
I looked in the window there
and I seen my mother laying on the floor,

140
00:12:47,833 --> 00:12:50,358
without any clothes on.

141
00:12:50,436 --> 00:12:52,427
Mm-hm.

142
00:12:55,775 --> 00:12:58,972
I seen Jesse Dixon a-layin' on top of her.

143
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:04,138
He was having his way with her.

144
00:13:05,417 --> 00:13:07,749
Well, I just seen red.

145
00:13:11,423 --> 00:13:15,291
I picked up a Kaiser blade
that was sitting there by the screen door.

146
00:13:15,361 --> 00:13:19,593
Some folks call it a sling blade,
I call it a Kaiser blade.

147
00:13:19,665 --> 00:13:23,601
It's got a long wood handle,
kind of like an axe handle.

148
00:13:23,669 --> 00:13:27,867
With a long blade on it
shaped kind of like a banana. Mm-hm.

149
00:13:27,940 --> 00:13:31,637
Sharp on one edge and dull on the other.

150
00:13:31,710 --> 00:13:36,704
It's what the highway boys use
to cut down weeds and whatnot.

151
00:13:39,018 --> 00:13:41,953
Well, I went in there in the house,

152
00:13:42,021 --> 00:13:47,254
and I hit Jesse Dixon upside the head
with it, knocked him off my mother.

153
00:13:48,260 --> 00:13:51,423
I reckon that didn't quite satisfy me.

154
00:13:53,265 --> 00:13:56,029
So I hit him again with it in the neck
with the sharp edge

155
00:13:56,101 --> 00:14:00,128
and just plumb near cut his head off,
killed him.

156
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:04,765
My mother, she jumped up from there
and started hollerin':

157
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,836
"What did you kill Jesse for?
What did you kill Jesse for?"

158
00:14:07,913 --> 00:14:09,778
Well...

159
00:14:09,849 --> 00:14:15,287
Come to find out I don't reckon my mother
minded what Jesse was a-doin' to her.

160
00:14:15,354 --> 00:14:19,256
I reckon that made me madder
than what Jesse had made me.

161
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,657
So I taken the Kaiser blade,

162
00:14:21,727 --> 00:14:26,255
some folks call it a sling blade,
I call it a Kaiser blade,

163
00:14:27,266 --> 00:14:31,293
and I hit my mother
upside the head with it.

164
00:14:33,272 --> 00:14:34,933
Killed her.

165
00:14:39,511 --> 00:14:41,638
Some folks has asked me:

166
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:45,650
"If you had it to do over again,
would you do it the same way?"

167
00:14:45,718 --> 00:14:48,050
Well, I reckon I would.

168
00:14:49,388 --> 00:14:55,384
Anyhow, they seen fit to put me in here,
and here I've been for a great long while.

169
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,895
I've learned to read some.

170
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:04,235
Took me four years to read the Bible.

171
00:15:04,303 --> 00:15:07,363
I reckon I understand a great deal of it.

172
00:15:07,439 --> 00:15:10,636
Wasn't what I expected in some places.

173
00:15:12,411 --> 00:15:16,211
I've slept in a good bed
for a great long while.

174
00:15:17,416 --> 00:15:19,816
Now they've seen fit to put me out of here.

175
00:15:19,885 --> 00:15:23,218
They say they're setting me free today.

176
00:15:26,025 --> 00:15:29,756
Anyhow, I reckon
that's all you'd need to know.

177
00:15:30,562 --> 00:15:34,498
If you wanna hear about more details,
I reckon I can tell 'em to you.

178
00:15:34,566 --> 00:15:39,196
I don't know whether or not that's enough
for your newspaper or not. Mm-hm.

179
00:15:39,271 --> 00:15:43,401
("Marsha.) Will you ever
kill anybody again, Karl?

180
00:15:53,218 --> 00:15:57,245
I don't reckon
I've got no reason to kill nobody.

181
00:16:06,632 --> 00:16:09,260
- Where will he go?
- Anywhere he wants to.

182
00:16:09,335 --> 00:16:11,326
I think he's going back to Millsberg,
where he's from.

183
00:16:11,403 --> 00:16:14,736
- It's just about 20 miles from here.
- Will he be supervised?

184
00:16:14,807 --> 00:16:17,105
As much as anybody else is, I guess.

185
00:16:17,176 --> 00:16:20,339
Y'all have a real nice rest of the day, now.

186
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:23,245
I'll get Melvin to walk y'all out.

187
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:31,513
Melvin, could you
walk these girls out, please?

188
00:16:32,124 --> 00:16:33,955
Thank you.

189
00:16:34,026 --> 00:16:35,857
Thank you.

190
00:16:46,105 --> 00:16:50,337
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used
to looking at purdy people. Mm-hm.

191
00:16:50,409 --> 00:16:52,570
I guess you will.

192
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:58,882
I reckon I'm gonna have to get used
to them looking at me, too.

193
00:16:58,951 --> 00:17:01,442
Better go get your things.

194
00:17:01,520 --> 00:17:04,421
I ain't got nothing but them books.

195
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:07,652
Better go get 'em.

196
00:17:08,527 --> 00:17:10,518
All right, then.

197
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,499
All right, then.

198
00:20:21,086 --> 00:20:23,316
Can I help you, sir?

199
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,257
Can I help you, sir?

200
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:33,091
I was kindly wanting
something or other to eat. Mm-hm.

201
00:20:33,165 --> 00:20:35,497
Well, what would you like?

202
00:20:37,269 --> 00:20:40,067
You got any biscuits for sale in there?

203
00:20:40,138 --> 00:20:43,835
No, this here's a Frostee Cream.
We don't serve biscuits.

204
00:20:43,909 --> 00:20:48,107
- We got a lot of other stuff, though.
- What you got in there that's good to eat?

205
00:20:48,180 --> 00:20:52,480
Well, we got Big Chief burgers,
Bongo burgers, Footlongs, Corny Dogs,

206
00:20:52,551 --> 00:20:55,179
Frostee Shakes, Creamy Bars.

207
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,223
Did you want me
to go through the whole list?

208
00:20:58,290 --> 00:21:00,815
Reckon what do you like to eat in there?

209
00:21:02,261 --> 00:21:04,627
Well...

210
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:07,631
The French fries are pretty good.

211
00:21:07,699 --> 00:21:11,499
- French-fried potatoes?
- Yep, French fries.

212
00:21:14,172 --> 00:21:16,106
How much you want for 'em?

213
00:21:16,174 --> 00:21:20,167
Well, they're 60 for the medium
and 75 for the large.

214
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,978
I reckon I'll have me some of the big 'uns.

215
00:21:26,051 --> 00:21:29,452
All right, then. One large French fries.

216
00:22:09,828 --> 00:22:14,197
These darn things are heavy.
Hard to carry, too.

217
00:22:14,266 --> 00:22:17,667
- What you got in there, wash?
- Yeah.

218
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,730
Ain't you got no mom and daddy
to tend to it?

219
00:22:21,807 --> 00:22:26,540
I got a momma. She's at work
over at Hoochy's Dollar Store.

220
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:29,842
Daddy's dead.
He got hit by a train.

221
00:22:32,551 --> 00:22:35,452
How far are you going
with them sacks full of wash?

222
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:37,852
Half a mile, I think it is.

223
00:22:39,091 --> 00:22:41,992
I can help you tote it
if I don't give out first.

224
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:44,722
OK, but you don't have to.

225
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,733
All right, then.

226
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:54,697
My name's Frank Wheatley.
What's your name?

227
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:57,071
Karl's my name.

228
00:22:57,142 --> 00:23:00,134
- What's your last name?
- Childers.

229
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:03,675
What are all them books?

230
00:23:03,749 --> 00:23:05,740
All different ones.

231
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:08,251
One of 'em's the Bible,
one of 'em's a book on Christmas,

232
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:10,754
one of 'em's on how to be a carpenter.

233
00:23:10,822 --> 00:23:15,122
- Why do you carry them around with you?
- I ain't got no place to set 'em down.

234
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,320
Don't you live somewhere?

235
00:23:17,396 --> 00:23:20,263
Did live up there in the state hospital.

236
00:23:20,332 --> 00:23:24,428
- Why did you live there?
- I killed some folks quite a while back.

237
00:23:24,503 --> 00:23:27,939
They said I wasn't right in the head, so they
put me there in the nervous hospital

238
00:23:28,006 --> 00:23:30,236
instead of putting me in jail.

239
00:23:30,308 --> 00:23:32,970
- They let you out?
- Yeah.

240
00:23:33,044 --> 00:23:36,810
- How come?
- They told me I was well.

241
00:23:36,882 --> 00:23:39,646
Had to turn me loose.

242
00:23:39,718 --> 00:23:43,654
- Well, are you well?
- I reckon I feel all right.

243
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,256
This here's my house.

244
00:23:50,962 --> 00:23:54,693
You don't seem like you'd kill nobody.

245
00:23:54,766 --> 00:23:56,961
We can just set these bags on the porch.

246
00:23:57,035 --> 00:23:59,560
All right, then.

247
00:24:14,953 --> 00:24:17,547
You like to play football?

248
00:24:17,622 --> 00:24:22,491
I never was no account at it.
I never did get picked out for it.

249
00:24:22,561 --> 00:24:24,961
Well, me and the Burnett twins
and some boys play

250
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:27,692
at the junior high school field all the time.

251
00:24:27,766 --> 00:24:32,203
If you wanna play, you can come on over,
'cause we ain't no good either.

252
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:35,967
- Well, I'll see you later.
- All right, then.

253
00:25:29,661 --> 00:25:31,492
Karl.

254
00:25:31,563 --> 00:25:34,157
Hon, you can't just go in there.

255
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:37,298
Karl, what in the world are you doing here?

256
00:25:37,369 --> 00:25:39,963
I wanna come back and stay in here.

257
00:25:40,972 --> 00:25:43,236
You can't do that.
You're a free man.

258
00:25:43,308 --> 00:25:46,141
They let you out
so you can do as you please.

259
00:25:46,211 --> 00:25:48,873
I reckon I don't care nothing
about being a free man.

260
00:25:48,947 --> 00:25:51,507
I don't know how to go about it. Mm-hm.

261
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:55,747
Well, you're gonna have to learn.
It'll take some time.

262
00:25:55,820 --> 00:25:58,721
Don't you have anybody down there
to help you out?

263
00:25:58,790 --> 00:26:01,054
No, sir.

264
00:26:01,126 --> 00:26:06,325
Well, your daddy was living down there
the last time I heard.

265
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:10,391
I guess he wouldn't want
to help you out any, would he?

266
00:26:10,468 --> 00:26:12,800
Sorry, I wasn't thinking.

267
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:17,504
Don't you have anybody?

268
00:26:17,576 --> 00:26:19,669
No, sir.

269
00:26:19,744 --> 00:26:22,679
Never did know too much
of nobody down there.

270
00:26:22,747 --> 00:26:25,238
Not to be helping me out no way. Mm-hm.

271
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,652
Look, Karl, the truth is,
I don't know where they expect you to go,

272
00:26:32,724 --> 00:26:34,885
and I don't know
what they expect you to do.

273
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,659
If it was up to me, you could
come back here and stay if you wanted to.

274
00:26:39,731 --> 00:26:42,529
I'm just trying to do my job.

275
00:26:42,601 --> 00:26:44,762
You follow me?

276
00:26:47,973 --> 00:26:54,037
Listen, Karl. I know an old boy
who's got a fix-it shop deal in Millsberg.

277
00:26:54,112 --> 00:26:56,603
He used to go to church with me.

278
00:26:58,416 --> 00:27:00,976
You're good working
on small engines and things.

279
00:27:01,052 --> 00:27:05,318
If I was to put my neck out for you with him,

280
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:09,326
do you think you could work it
if he'll hire you?

281
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:14,355
I'm pretty handy, I reckon,
on lawn mowers and whatnot. Mm-hm.

282
00:27:14,432 --> 00:27:17,367
I know you are, I've seen it myself.

283
00:27:17,435 --> 00:27:20,427
- Could you give it a try?
- I reckon.

284
00:27:22,107 --> 00:27:25,907
Now, I...
I can't promise you that he'll hire you.

285
00:27:25,977 --> 00:27:29,378
I'll have to tell him about your history.

286
00:27:29,447 --> 00:27:32,143
I never was no good with history. Mm-hm.

287
00:27:32,217 --> 00:27:35,186
No. I mean your past.

288
00:27:37,789 --> 00:27:39,950
Why you were in here.

289
00:27:41,159 --> 00:27:44,390
I'll take you down first thing in the morning.

290
00:27:45,397 --> 00:27:48,855
You don't have anywhere
you could stay tonight at all?

291
00:27:48,933 --> 00:27:50,696
- No, sir.
- Well, you can't stay here.

292
00:27:50,769 --> 00:27:56,298
It's against the rules.
If something was to happen, I'd be liable.

293
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:00,477
I reckon I can just walk around
till morning time.

294
00:28:00,545 --> 00:28:03,343
And sit and read a book somewheres.
Mm-hm.

295
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:24,030
Karl, would you like a muffin?

296
00:28:24,102 --> 00:28:26,093
No, thank you.

297
00:28:29,841 --> 00:28:34,608
I understand Jerry's gonna take you
someplace else tomorrow.

298
00:28:34,679 --> 00:28:38,240
I don't reckon I know nobody named Jerry.

299
00:28:38,316 --> 00:28:42,047
She's talking about me, Karl.
That's my first name.

300
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:46,750
He's carrying me to look for work down
in Millsberg, where I was born. Mm-hm.

301
00:28:49,227 --> 00:28:51,218
Would you like some coffee?

302
00:28:51,296 --> 00:28:55,460
Coffee makes me a mite nervous
when I drink it.

303
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:58,594
Daddy, can I be excused to go to bed?

304
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:01,104
Sure, honey.
You sleep with your momma tonight.

305
00:29:01,172 --> 00:29:04,039
I'm gonna sleep with your brother,
so Karl can have your room.

306
00:29:04,109 --> 00:29:05,633
Why?

307
00:29:07,112 --> 00:29:09,103
'Cause he's company.

308
00:29:20,358 --> 00:29:23,885
Well, Karl, looks like you got
plenty of blankets and things.

309
00:29:23,962 --> 00:29:27,022
Bathroom's out there in the hall.

310
00:29:27,098 --> 00:29:29,225
We'll leave at first light.

311
00:29:29,300 --> 00:29:32,599
That's a... that's an old cowboy thing.

312
00:29:57,162 --> 00:30:00,689
Jerry, why didn't you give him Bubba's
room? His sister's is a little girly, isn't it?

313
00:30:00,765 --> 00:30:04,257
Yeah, I thought about that. I guess it
doesn't make any sense to move him now.

314
00:30:04,335 --> 00:30:06,030
Daddy...

315
00:30:06,104 --> 00:30:11,269
Don't you think one of us ought to stay up
all night and kind of guard or something?

316
00:30:11,342 --> 00:30:13,776
Well, hell, no, son.
What's wrong with you?

317
00:30:13,845 --> 00:30:18,680
- He's a nut, ain't he?
- "Isn't," Bubba. Don't say "ain't."

318
00:30:30,528 --> 00:30:31,790
("Knocks at door)

319
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:35,162
- Karl, are you up?
- Yes, sir.

320
00:30:39,037 --> 00:30:41,130
Didn't you go to sleep at all, Karl?

321
00:30:41,206 --> 00:30:43,299
You been sitting there like that all night?

322
00:30:43,374 --> 00:30:45,467
Yes, sir.

323
00:30:45,543 --> 00:30:48,637
Well, come on.
We'd better hit the road.

324
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:51,079
All right, then.

325
00:31:43,801 --> 00:31:46,395
- Hey, Jerry. How's it going?
- Hey, Bill.

326
00:31:46,471 --> 00:31:48,166
Good to see you, man.
It's been a long time.

327
00:31:48,239 --> 00:31:50,434
It's good to see you, too.
How's everybody doing?

328
00:31:50,508 --> 00:31:54,569
Oh, pretty good. Kids are driving me crazy,
Phyllis is gonna put me in the poorhouse,

329
00:31:54,646 --> 00:31:58,343
but I can't complain other than that.
Wouldn't do any good if I did.

330
00:31:58,416 --> 00:32:00,782
- You know Scooter, Jerry?
- I don't believe I do.

331
00:32:00,852 --> 00:32:03,980
- Good to meet you, Scooter.
- How about you?

332
00:32:04,055 --> 00:32:06,546
Well, this is him, the one
I was telling you about on the phone.

333
00:32:06,624 --> 00:32:09,593
Like I said, if you get nervous about it,
I'll understand.

334
00:32:09,661 --> 00:32:13,188
I'm not gonna lie to you. He did get
into that trouble, but then he was young.

335
00:32:13,264 --> 00:32:17,200
I remember that real well. He cut those
folks to pieces, his momma was one of 'em.

336
00:32:17,268 --> 00:32:19,168
Yeah, and that old Dixon boy.

337
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:23,367
Oh, hell, I always wanted to kill him myself.
Asshole's what he was.

338
00:32:23,441 --> 00:32:28,640
I remember that old boy, too. Kind of
retarded or something back in school.

339
00:32:28,713 --> 00:32:32,774
Well, seems like he's
pretty well-adjusted these days.

340
00:32:32,850 --> 00:32:35,751
He... I don't think he'd ever hurt anybody.

341
00:32:35,820 --> 00:32:37,845
He don't look much like he would.

342
00:32:37,922 --> 00:32:40,447
You say he fixes small engines
like nobody's business?

343
00:32:40,525 --> 00:32:43,187
He's a regular whiz.
It's all he's done since he was a kid.

344
00:32:43,261 --> 00:32:47,493
- Are you scared of him, Scooter?
- No, I don't guess so.

345
00:32:47,565 --> 00:32:49,624
- Can he talk?
- Oh, yeah.

346
00:32:49,701 --> 00:32:52,431
Now, you say he can stay out the back?

347
00:32:52,503 --> 00:32:56,564
Fine with me. If he steals anything, I'm
gonna take it out of your pocket anyway.

348
00:32:56,641 --> 00:33:00,133
Oh, he won't steal. He's a pretty good
old boy, really. Keeps to himself.

349
00:33:00,211 --> 00:33:04,875
Well, I got a roomful of work for him to do.
I can't get Scooter to do any of it.

350
00:33:04,949 --> 00:33:09,181
Karl, come over here.
I want you to meet your new boss.

351
00:33:09,253 --> 00:33:11,278
This is Bill Cox.

352
00:33:11,356 --> 00:33:14,917
He runs the place. Says that you
can work here and stay out back.

353
00:33:14,993 --> 00:33:18,520
- It's good to know you, Karl.
- Thank you.

354
00:33:18,596 --> 00:33:20,791
Karl, it's minimum wage,
and there ain't nothing back there

355
00:33:20,865 --> 00:33:23,265
but an old army cot and a toilet.

356
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:26,895
Yeah, that'll be fine. Karl, I'm gonna
go out to the car and get your books.

357
00:33:26,971 --> 00:33:28,962
All right, then.

358
00:33:31,709 --> 00:33:36,271
Karl, they say you're a whiz
on fixing lawn mowers and things.

359
00:33:36,347 --> 00:33:39,578
I've tinkered around on 'em a little bit.
Mm-hm.

360
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:43,452
We order up from the Frostee Cream
at lunch, usually.

361
00:33:43,521 --> 00:33:47,218
We can buy you lunch
till you get on your feet a little.

362
00:33:47,291 --> 00:33:50,624
I like them French-fried potatoes. Mm-hm.

363
00:33:51,596 --> 00:33:53,587
Yeah? Me, too.

364
00:33:55,900 --> 00:33:58,892
They make a good double meat burger.

365
00:34:11,916 --> 00:34:14,282
All right, then.
I'll see y'all later.

366
00:34:14,352 --> 00:34:17,753
Karl, you done a good day's work today.
They was right about you.

367
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:21,280
Scooter, he gonna knock you out of a job
if you're not careful.

368
00:34:21,359 --> 00:34:27,355
- All right, then, I'll see y'all tomorrow.
- Wait up. I'll leave with you and lock up.

369
00:34:27,432 --> 00:34:29,127
Karl, there's a blanket up in under that cot

370
00:34:29,200 --> 00:34:32,192
and some soap in the bathroom
for cleaning up with.

371
00:34:32,270 --> 00:34:36,263
Now, there's one more thing. The way we
lock these doors, you can't get out at night.

372
00:34:36,340 --> 00:34:40,003
- You didn't wanna go anywhere, did you?
- I don't reckon.

373
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:43,878
If it works out, maybe we'll get you a key
so you can get out at night if you need to.

374
00:34:43,948 --> 00:34:47,145
- I'll see you later.
- All right, then.

375
00:34:59,163 --> 00:35:04,362
So then the old man says, "At my age,
I'd rather have the talking frog."

376
00:35:04,435 --> 00:35:06,596
We'll see you, JW.

377
00:35:25,990 --> 00:35:29,619
Scooter, did I tell you the one about
the two old boys pissing off the bridge?

378
00:35:29,694 --> 00:35:32,891
- I don't remember.
- Well...

379
00:35:32,964 --> 00:35:36,263
These two old boys hung their peckers
off the bridge to piss.

380
00:35:36,334 --> 00:35:39,633
And one of the boys was from California
and one from Arkansas.

381
00:35:39,704 --> 00:35:42,935
Old boy from California says,
"Boy, this water's cold."

382
00:35:43,007 --> 00:35:47,637
Old boy from Arkansas said,
"Yeah, and it's deep, too."

383
00:35:49,247 --> 00:35:51,738
Get it?

384
00:35:51,816 --> 00:35:54,512
- That's a good 'un.
- That is a good one.

385
00:35:54,585 --> 00:35:56,985
You know, I do believe
you've told me that one before.

386
00:35:57,054 --> 00:35:59,079
I've heard that one a bunch.

387
00:35:59,157 --> 00:36:03,287
- A long time ago.
- Yeah, that's a classic.

388
00:36:03,361 --> 00:36:05,591
You know, Karl,
I got to thinking about it last night,

389
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,826
and it's just not Christian of me
not to let you have a key.

390
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:11,630
I mean, you've been in lockup so long,
you don't need me keeping you locked up.

391
00:36:11,702 --> 00:36:13,863
You need to come and go as you please.

392
00:36:13,938 --> 00:36:15,769
Here.

393
00:36:15,840 --> 00:36:20,368
Take this key.
It'll get you in and out of here at night.

394
00:36:21,679 --> 00:36:23,670
All right, then.

395
00:36:25,883 --> 00:36:30,286
- Them French fries good?
- Yeah, they're good all right. Mm-hm.

396
00:36:31,455 --> 00:36:33,548
You got any money?

397
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:38,825
Well, they give me some
when they turned me loose.

398
00:36:38,896 --> 00:36:44,630
I spent up some of it a-ridin' on the bus
and eating French-fried potatoes. Mm-hm.

399
00:36:44,702 --> 00:36:48,297
Well, I'm gonna pay you today
for this coming week

400
00:36:48,372 --> 00:36:50,772
so you have some walking-around money.

401
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:53,241
When you get off this evening,
you need to go buy some toothpaste

402
00:36:53,311 --> 00:36:56,041
and some cleaning up supplies
to have back there.

403
00:36:56,113 --> 00:36:59,514
Get you some magazines
and some hard candy.

404
00:36:59,584 --> 00:37:02,109
Something to keep you busy at night.

405
00:37:03,120 --> 00:37:05,111
All right, then.

406
00:37:05,189 --> 00:37:08,784
I'll let you off while it's still daylight.

407
00:37:40,057 --> 00:37:43,458
Hey, there.
I thought I heard somebody on the porch.

408
00:37:43,527 --> 00:37:46,155
Wasn't your name Karl?

409
00:37:46,230 --> 00:37:49,563
Yes, sir, it is.
Your name's Frank.

410
00:37:50,334 --> 00:37:53,633
Yeah. What are you doing by here?

411
00:37:53,704 --> 00:37:56,036
You said for me to come by.

412
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:58,268
You wanna play ball with us?

413
00:37:58,342 --> 00:38:02,574
I ain't no good at it.
I just come by to see you. Mm-hm.

414
00:38:02,647 --> 00:38:05,810
Well, I was going to see my momma
over at Hoochy's Dollar Store.

415
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:08,078
She works two till eight.

416
00:38:08,152 --> 00:38:10,814
All right, then.

417
00:38:10,888 --> 00:38:14,380
You wanna go with me?
You can meet my momma.

418
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:18,060
I oughta not worry your momma
with company.

419
00:38:18,129 --> 00:38:22,156
Aw, come on. You'll like her.
She's real nice.

420
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:26,033
And she'll give us anything we want her to.
Candy or something.

421
00:38:27,805 --> 00:38:30,774
Well, I was kindly needing
to do some trading.

422
00:38:30,841 --> 00:38:32,934
Reckon they sell toothpaste?

423
00:38:33,010 --> 00:38:36,309
Yeah, they sell a little bit of everything.

424
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:40,578
I won't tell her about you
being in the state hospital for killing.

425
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:43,176
Come on, let's go.

426
00:38:57,435 --> 00:39:00,495
You're just gonna have to learn to live
without all that grease.

427
00:39:00,571 --> 00:39:02,596
Shoot, not here in the South.

428
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:06,473
I like grease on everything.
I like fried chicken, fried okra.

429
00:39:06,544 --> 00:39:08,136
- Biscuits and gravy.
- It'll kill you.

430
00:39:08,212 --> 00:39:10,942
- Hey, Momma. Hey, Vaughan.
- Hey, sweetheart. What you up to?

431
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:13,779
I bet I know. You want
a whole bunch of candy and a pop, right?

432
00:39:13,851 --> 00:39:14,340
Yeah.

433
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:18,184
That stuffs gonna rot your teeth, don't you
know that? I got something even better.

434
00:39:18,255 --> 00:39:21,816
I just put potted meat on special-four cans
for a dollar. They're not moving very well.

435
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:26,158
But I tell you what, I'll give
a couple of cans for free to the right kid.

436
00:39:26,230 --> 00:39:28,221
I don't like potted meat.

437
00:39:28,299 --> 00:39:31,200
Daddy used to say they was made
out of lips, peckers and intest...

438
00:39:31,268 --> 00:39:33,259
Frank, don't talk that way.

439
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:38,104
Who's that strange-looking man
behind you? Did he follow you in here?

440
00:39:38,175 --> 00:39:41,201
- Can I help you, sir?
- ("Frank) Oh, that's Karl.

441
00:39:41,278 --> 00:39:43,371
I met him at the Laundromat.

442
00:39:43,447 --> 00:39:48,441
Karl, this is Momma and Vaughan.
Vaughan's the manager.

443
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:53,115
He lets Momma off any time
she feels like it, 'cause they're best friends.

444
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:56,057
Nice to meet you, Karl.

445
00:39:56,127 --> 00:39:58,459
Pleased to meet you.

446
00:40:01,465 --> 00:40:05,799
Frank, why don't you
come back here with me for a minute?

447
00:40:10,574 --> 00:40:14,032
I don't think I've seen you here before.

448
00:40:14,111 --> 00:40:18,047
No, sir, I don't reckon you have. I don't
believe I've ever been in here before.

449
00:40:18,115 --> 00:40:21,573
I don't believe this store used to be here.

450
00:40:21,652 --> 00:40:26,089
It's been here 17 years.
You live here before, or something?

451
00:40:26,157 --> 00:40:30,253
I was born and raised here
up till I was 12 year old.

452
00:40:30,327 --> 00:40:32,557
What brings you back?

453
00:40:32,630 --> 00:40:34,723
What's that you say?

454
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,792
Why are you here now?

455
00:40:38,803 --> 00:40:41,670
They turned me loose
from the state hospital. Mm-hm.

456
00:40:41,739 --> 00:40:44,230
Is that right?

457
00:40:44,275 --> 00:40:46,505
How long are you gonna be staying here?

458
00:40:46,577 --> 00:40:52,106
Mr. Woolridge, he got me hired on
to work for Bill Cox's outfit. Mm-hm.

459
00:40:52,183 --> 00:40:55,016
- You have family here?
- Not to speak of.

460
00:40:55,085 --> 00:40:59,784
Hey, Karl. Guess what? Momma said you
can stay over with us out in the garage.

461
00:40:59,857 --> 00:41:02,985
Our car won't fit in there anyway.
It's real neat.

462
00:41:03,060 --> 00:41:06,552
Frank told me about your situation.
Frank loves company.

463
00:41:06,630 --> 00:41:09,258
You know, especially after
his daddy passed an' all.

464
00:41:09,333 --> 00:41:12,894
There ain't no sense in you staying
in that old greasy shop.

465
00:41:12,970 --> 00:41:16,565
- He's mentally retarded, poor thing.
- He just got out of the state hospital.

466
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:19,632
- I know.
- Can we get some candy and pop?

467
00:41:19,710 --> 00:41:22,406
- Sure thing. Go ahead.
- Come on.

468
00:41:23,914 --> 00:41:26,109
You think it's safe
to let him around that guy?

469
00:41:26,183 --> 00:41:29,516
Frank's just crazy about him.
He likes the way he talks.

470
00:41:29,587 --> 00:41:31,953
He helped him carry home
the clean laundry.

471
00:41:32,022 --> 00:41:35,549
He's been in the state hospital a long time.
There must be something wrong with him.

472
00:41:35,626 --> 00:41:38,754
He's retarded's all.
You know he's always after a father figure.

473
00:41:38,829 --> 00:41:41,059
Lord knows,
Doyle ain't a good one with his mean ass.

474
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:44,828
- What about me?
- I don't think he sees you as a "guy" guy.

475
00:41:44,902 --> 00:41:47,234
Oh, Karl's a "guy" guy?

476
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:08,051
This is what I call my secret place,

477
00:42:08,125 --> 00:42:11,617
'cause I come out here
when I feel like being by myself.

478
00:42:11,695 --> 00:42:15,961
I used to come here with Karen Cross.
She's kind of like my girlfriend.

479
00:42:16,033 --> 00:42:18,024
Or used to be.

480
00:42:18,102 --> 00:42:20,969
We used to come out here
and hold hands and talk,

481
00:42:21,038 --> 00:42:24,201
and read books to each other
with a flashlight.

482
00:42:24,275 --> 00:42:27,039
She didn't want to have
nothing to do with me in front of people,

483
00:42:27,111 --> 00:42:31,172
'cause I don't have any money.
Well, Momma and me, I mean.

484
00:42:31,248 --> 00:42:34,274
See, her daddy's a dentist, so they're rich.

485
00:42:35,019 --> 00:42:37,544
Was your folks well off?

486
00:42:37,621 --> 00:42:42,251
No, we didn't have too much. Just barely
enough to scrape by on, I reckon.

487
00:42:42,326 --> 00:42:45,193
They still around, your folks?

488
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:49,460
My mother's dead. My daddy,
he's supposed to be around still.

489
00:42:49,533 --> 00:42:51,797
But he don't wanna have
nothing to do with me.

490
00:42:51,869 --> 00:42:53,962
How do you know?

491
00:42:54,038 --> 00:42:59,533
Well, he never did want to. I figure
he probably ain't changed his mind much.

492
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:01,942
How did your momma die?

493
00:43:04,148 --> 00:43:08,551
You don't need to hear things like that.
You're just a boy.

494
00:43:08,619 --> 00:43:11,747
You need to think about good thoughts
while you're still a boy.

495
00:43:11,822 --> 00:43:15,121
There's plenty of time for all the other.
Mm-hm.

496
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:17,786
I've had a lot of bad thoughts
since Daddy died.

497
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:22,195
Sometimes I wish I was still real little
and he was still here.

498
00:43:22,266 --> 00:43:25,167
Momma's real good,
but I wish I had both of 'em.

499
00:43:25,235 --> 00:43:27,829
We went to Memphis in the car one time.

500
00:43:27,905 --> 00:43:30,499
It was raining so hard,
we couldn't see the road.

501
00:43:30,574 --> 00:43:33,304
But I wasn't scared,
'cause as long as Daddy was driving,

502
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:35,368
I thought nothing could happen to us.

503
00:43:35,446 --> 00:43:38,540
That's the way I feel about Momma now.

504
00:43:40,217 --> 00:43:45,348
Momma has a boyfriend now.
His name is Doyle Hargraves.

505
00:43:45,422 --> 00:43:48,186
He works construction,
so he makes a pretty good living.

506
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:51,125
But he still don't help Momma out
with any money, though.

507
00:43:51,195 --> 00:43:53,789
He ain't no good.
He's mean to her.

508
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:57,027
He don't like me at all.
Momma says it's 'cause he's jealous,

509
00:43:57,101 --> 00:44:00,127
'cause I belong to my daddy instead of him.

510
00:44:00,204 --> 00:44:05,039
He spends the night over at our house
sometimes, and he's got his own house.

511
00:44:05,109 --> 00:44:08,408
Somebody told me
it's where he can have more girlfriends.

512
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:10,640
I like it on the nights he ain't at our house.

513
00:44:10,714 --> 00:44:13,046
I ain't so nervous then.

514
00:44:15,152 --> 00:44:19,316
How come her to still be girlfriend
an' all with him if he mean to her?

515
00:44:19,390 --> 00:44:22,188
She says it's for the times
when he's good to her.

516
00:44:22,259 --> 00:44:26,855
She's lonely since Daddy died.
Sometimes she says she don't know why.

517
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,558
He threatened to kill her
if she ever left him.

518
00:44:29,633 --> 00:44:34,263
My daddy would kill him if he was still here
and somebody was mean to Momma.

519
00:44:34,338 --> 00:44:38,399
Vaughan, he's real good to Momma.
Vaughan that you met.

520
00:44:38,475 --> 00:44:40,568
But he's not able to do anything to Doyle.

521
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:43,875
He's funny, you know.
Not funny ha-ha, funny queer.

522
00:44:43,947 --> 00:44:46,211
He likes to go with men instead of women.

523
00:44:46,283 --> 00:44:48,911
That makes him
not be able to fight too good.

524
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:51,079
He sure is nice, though.

525
00:44:51,155 --> 00:44:55,387
He's from St. Louis. People who are
queer get along better in a big town.

526
00:44:55,459 --> 00:44:57,950
I wish he liked to go with women.

527
00:44:57,995 --> 00:45:01,089
I'd rather him be Momma's boyfriend
than Doyle.

528
00:45:02,366 --> 00:45:06,894
Karl, you know when I told you
Daddy got hit by a train?

529
00:45:06,970 --> 00:45:09,097
Yes, I recollect that.

530
00:45:10,107 --> 00:45:15,568
It ain't the truth. He shot himself
with a shotgun on purpose.

531
00:45:15,646 --> 00:45:18,376
How come he would do that, reckon?

532
00:45:19,183 --> 00:45:23,142
'Cause he didn't have enough money
to take care of us the way he wanted to.

533
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:28,783
That's what the letter said. He got laid off
at work and started working odd jobs.

534
00:45:28,859 --> 00:45:31,987
I thought he took care of us just fine.

535
00:45:36,934 --> 00:45:39,698
Karl, did you really kill somebody?

536
00:45:40,704 --> 00:45:43,832
- Yes, sir, I did.
- Who did you kill?

537
00:45:43,907 --> 00:45:47,104
- Two people.
- Were they bad people?

538
00:45:47,177 --> 00:45:49,168
I thought they was.

539
00:45:50,147 --> 00:45:53,173
Well, maybe they needed it.

540
00:45:53,250 --> 00:45:58,745
Well, I growed up and learned
that you ain't supposed to kill nobody.

541
00:45:58,822 --> 00:46:01,222
It's all right
if you're looking out for yourself.

542
00:46:01,291 --> 00:46:05,284
If it's self-defense.
Was it self-defense?

543
00:46:08,398 --> 00:46:12,960
My daddy was good.
I think too many good people die.

544
00:46:13,036 --> 00:46:15,368
That's what I think.

545
00:46:37,861 --> 00:46:40,386
Karl, are you sure you wanna
go stay with these folks?

546
00:46:40,464 --> 00:46:44,264
You're welcome to keep on staying here.
It's working out real good.

547
00:46:44,334 --> 00:46:46,495
That boy wants me to.

548
00:46:47,404 --> 00:46:50,202
All right, then.
I'll see you bright and early.

549
00:46:50,274 --> 00:46:52,265
How are you coming along
with that garden tiller?

550
00:46:52,342 --> 00:46:55,140
I fixed it.
It's working pretty good now. Mm-hm.

551
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:59,774
You done fixed it? Well, I'll be damned.
Scooter told me it couldn't be fixed.

552
00:46:59,850 --> 00:47:03,650
Of course, Scooter's about as shiftless
as one poor son of a bitch can be.

553
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:07,315
You done fixed it.
Well, I'll just be damned.

554
00:47:07,391 --> 00:47:11,418
- Well, I'll see you tomorrow.
- All right, then.

555
00:47:18,902 --> 00:47:22,429
I don't guess I give a shit, 'cause,
I mean, I ain't here that much anyway.

556
00:47:22,506 --> 00:47:26,272
If you want a retard living out in the garage,
I guess that's your business.

557
00:47:26,343 --> 00:47:28,573
Of course, I do got some tools out there
and a set of sockets

558
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:31,773
I'd rather not have stole.
I could take those home with me.

559
00:47:31,849 --> 00:47:33,942
He's real honest.
He wouldn't steal nothing.

560
00:47:34,017 --> 00:47:36,713
Now, Frankie,
I wasn't talking to you, was I?

561
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:39,449
- Huh?
- No, sir.

562
00:47:39,523 --> 00:47:42,321
"No, sir" is right.
I was talking to your momma.

563
00:47:42,392 --> 00:47:48,388
This is her decision, not yours. If I let it
go on, it's 'cause she asked me, not you.

564
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:54,128
Hey, is this the kind of retard that drools
and rubs shit in his hair and all that?

565
00:47:54,204 --> 00:47:57,401
'Cause I'm gonna have a hard time
eating around that kind of thing, now.

566
00:47:57,474 --> 00:47:59,874
Just like I am
about antique furniture and midgets.

567
00:47:59,943 --> 00:48:02,138
You know that. I can't so much
as drink a damn glass of water

568
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:04,612
around a midget
or a piece of antique furniture.

569
00:48:04,681 --> 00:48:06,911
Doyle, you're awful.
You shouldn't be that way.

570
00:48:06,984 --> 00:48:09,578
I ain't saying it's right.
I'm just telling you it's the damn truth.

571
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:12,554
Now, he'll make me sick. I know it.

572
00:48:12,623 --> 00:48:16,889
- What was he in the nut house for?
- He's just mentally retarded, I guess.

573
00:48:16,960 --> 00:48:21,090
Mm-mm. No, no. He had to go nuts
and did something, now.

574
00:48:21,164 --> 00:48:24,497
Come on. There's a lot of retards running
around ain't locked up in the nut house.

575
00:48:24,568 --> 00:48:27,002
Think about it, Linda.

576
00:48:27,070 --> 00:48:30,767
- You know what he done, Frank?
- I ain't sure.

577
00:48:30,841 --> 00:48:32,433
Yeah, well,
you might oughta want to find out.

578
00:48:32,509 --> 00:48:35,376
He might have hacked his family to pieces
with a hatchet or something.

579
00:48:35,445 --> 00:48:37,436
Yeah, that's right, Frank.
You better ask him.

580
00:48:37,514 --> 00:48:40,745
I mean, don't hurt his feelings or anything,
but it'd be good to know.

581
00:48:40,817 --> 00:48:44,344
I'm sure it's nothing.
He seems real sweet.

582
00:48:44,421 --> 00:48:47,288
You're all hung up on people being sweet,
aren't you?

583
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:51,384
He's sweet, everybody's sweet.
Speaking of sweet, where's your girlfriend?

584
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:53,088
I thought you said
he's coming over here for something.

585
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:56,530
He'll be here in a little while.
He's taking me to get an ice cream.

586
00:48:56,600 --> 00:48:59,228
Ain't that sweet.
What am I gonna do about supper,

587
00:48:59,303 --> 00:49:01,066
while you're out running around
with that fag?

588
00:49:01,138 --> 00:49:03,971
You're not crippled.
Get in there and make something.

589
00:49:04,041 --> 00:49:06,566
Talking back and everything, aren't you?

590
00:49:06,643 --> 00:49:08,736
That kind of makes me horny, Linda.

591
00:49:08,812 --> 00:49:12,680
Frank, why don't you go off and play in
your room if Doyle's gonna talk nasty?

592
00:49:12,749 --> 00:49:16,014
- I don't wanna go play in my room.
- He don't wanna play in his room, baby.

593
00:49:16,086 --> 00:49:18,919
Just let him sit here.
Let's all just be a family.

594
00:49:18,989 --> 00:49:24,689
Till your mentally retarded friend
and your homosexual friend get here.

595
00:49:30,067 --> 00:49:32,058
("Footsteps.)

596
00:49:35,505 --> 00:49:36,904
("Vaughan.) Karl?

597
00:49:36,974 --> 00:49:38,965
Yes, sir.

598
00:49:39,776 --> 00:49:42,836
So you're really going to stay here?

599
00:49:42,913 --> 00:49:46,144
That boy, he wants me to.

600
00:49:46,216 --> 00:49:49,652
Have you knocked on the door yet?

601
00:49:49,720 --> 00:49:54,817
- No, sir, I ain't.
- How long have you been standing here?

602
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:57,485
Quite a spell, I reckon.

603
00:49:57,561 --> 00:50:00,553
Listen, Karl.
Before you get very used to staying here,

604
00:50:00,630 --> 00:50:04,964
I think you and I need to talk about
a few things. Can I take you to lunch?

605
00:50:05,035 --> 00:50:07,094
I done ate just a little bit ago. Mm-hm.

606
00:50:07,170 --> 00:50:10,833
No, I mean...
I mean tomorrow, or the next day.

607
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:16,172
I reckon I could use a little
something or other to eat at noon time.

608
00:50:16,246 --> 00:50:19,579
Bill Cox, he generally gets me a box lunch.

609
00:50:19,649 --> 00:50:23,380
But I reckon he can
lay off of doing it tomorrow. Mm-hm.

610
00:50:23,453 --> 00:50:28,356
OK. Well, then, I'll come by Mr. Cox's
and pick you up around noon, all right?

611
00:50:28,425 --> 00:50:30,416
All right, then.

612
00:50:34,331 --> 00:50:36,424
There's your girlfriend.

613
00:50:40,771 --> 00:50:42,762
Hey, y'all come on in.

614
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:46,373
Come on. Have a seat in here.

615
00:50:49,212 --> 00:50:52,272
- Hey, Vaughan. How are you, Karl?
- Oh, tolerable, I reckon.

616
00:50:52,349 --> 00:50:53,782
Karl, this is my boyfriend, Doyle.

617
00:50:53,850 --> 00:50:56,978
Frank, why don't you and Karl go on
out in the garage and fix him up a place?

618
00:50:57,054 --> 00:50:58,954
Play a game or something.
Vaughan, you ready to go?

619
00:50:59,022 --> 00:51:02,014
- Sure, I guess.
- Hey, honey, don't rush everybody off yet.

620
00:51:02,092 --> 00:51:04,083
Maybe you and Karl want to go with us?

621
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:08,029
Aw, I don't want to.
Me and Karl's got things we need to do.

622
00:51:08,098 --> 00:51:10,396
Hey, Vaughan. You know what I heard?

623
00:51:10,467 --> 00:51:13,732
I heard you been putting it on old Albert
Sellers, works over at the funeral home.

624
00:51:13,804 --> 00:51:17,934
- I know Albert. We're friends.
- No, I heard you's more than friends.

625
00:51:18,008 --> 00:51:21,569
Yeah, I heard Dick Rivers come in
and caught the two of you all bowed up

626
00:51:21,645 --> 00:51:23,977
and going at it right in the same room
with poor old Miss Olgetree,

627
00:51:24,047 --> 00:51:26,242
and her dead as a doornail,
laid out on a gurney.

628
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:29,615
- That's ridiculous. That is just a total lie.
- Let's go, Vaughan.

629
00:51:29,686 --> 00:51:32,177
Frank, we'll be back in a little while.
I'll bring you back something.

630
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:33,917
And your food's in the oven, warming over.

631
00:51:33,990 --> 00:51:37,118
See? You fixed him something, didn't you?

632
00:51:37,194 --> 00:51:40,220
Hey, Vaughan.
I was just going on with you.

633
00:51:40,297 --> 00:51:46,293
- Just joking around, you know, buddy.
- I know that. You're a real card, all right.

634
00:51:48,638 --> 00:51:52,506
So, Karl, come over here and sit down.
Talk to me.

635
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:03,709
Come on, Karl, let's go to the garage.

636
00:52:03,787 --> 00:52:06,381
Goddamnit, I wanna talk to him.

637
00:52:06,456 --> 00:52:08,447
You sit down, Karl.

638
00:52:13,730 --> 00:52:15,721
So what's in your bag?

639
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:21,601
Mm... This and that.

640
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:24,037
Toothpaste and whatnot. Mm-hm.

641
00:52:25,275 --> 00:52:27,709
What's all them books?

642
00:52:27,777 --> 00:52:32,578
Different ones.
One of 'em's the Bible. Mm-hm.

643
00:52:32,649 --> 00:52:35,982
You believe in the Bible, do you, Karl?

644
00:52:36,052 --> 00:52:38,680
Yes, sir, a good deal of it.

645
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:41,053
I can't understand all of it.

646
00:52:42,759 --> 00:52:45,250
Yeah, well, I can't understand none of it.

647
00:52:45,295 --> 00:52:49,732
This one begat that one, and that one
begat this one, and begat, and begat,

648
00:52:49,799 --> 00:52:53,098
and lo and behold, someone says
some shit to someone or another.

649
00:52:53,170 --> 00:52:55,661
- Just how retarded are you?
- Stop it, Doyle.

650
00:52:55,705 --> 00:53:00,335
Frankie, you be quiet.
We're talking. The adults are talking.

651
00:53:02,746 --> 00:53:08,378
So was you in lockup for cutting
someone up with a hatchet or something?

652
00:53:08,451 --> 00:53:12,387
I ain't never used no hatchet
that I remember. Mm-hm.

653
00:53:12,455 --> 00:53:17,222
So you're just crazy
in a retard kind of way, then, huh?

654
00:53:17,294 --> 00:53:20,457
It wouldn't matter to me
if you did do violence on somebody.

655
00:53:20,530 --> 00:53:23,192
I ain't scared of shit.

656
00:53:23,266 --> 00:53:26,394
You think I'm scared for you to stay here?

657
00:53:26,469 --> 00:53:30,405
You're just a humped-over retard,
it seems to me.

658
00:53:34,978 --> 00:53:39,779
I'm just kidding you.
Welcome to our humble home, buddy.

659
00:53:39,849 --> 00:53:43,114
See, Frank here needs
all the friends he can get.

660
00:53:43,186 --> 00:53:45,814
Frank's a weak little kid.

661
00:53:45,889 --> 00:53:48,187
His daddy taught him how to be a pussy.

662
00:53:48,258 --> 00:53:50,419
Stop, Doyle.
Don't talk about my daddy.

663
00:53:50,493 --> 00:53:52,791
("Mocking.) "Don't talk about my daddy."

664
00:53:53,863 --> 00:53:57,765
Go on, get outta here.
Go on out to the garage, leave me be.

665
00:53:57,834 --> 00:53:59,699
Go on.

666
00:53:59,769 --> 00:54:01,760
Come on, Karl.

667
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:14,540
Frankie?

668
00:54:14,618 --> 00:54:18,179
Don't say nothing about
our little spat to your momma, now.

669
00:54:18,255 --> 00:54:21,520
I don't want her worrying about your ass.

670
00:54:24,127 --> 00:54:27,995
I'd like to kill that son of a bitch.
I hate him.

671
00:54:29,165 --> 00:54:32,601
You oughta not talk thataway.
You're just a boy.

672
00:54:32,669 --> 00:54:34,796
Well, I hate him.

673
00:54:34,871 --> 00:54:37,533
He oughta not talk thataway
to you neither.

674
00:54:37,607 --> 00:54:41,941
He ain't no account,
if he's mean to you and your momma.

675
00:54:43,580 --> 00:54:46,378
Your momma and that fella that's carrying
me to get something or other to eat

676
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:49,145
going to be back directly.

677
00:54:49,219 --> 00:54:52,313
Will you be here with us for a long time?

678
00:54:52,389 --> 00:54:54,755
I reckon, if you want me to.

679
00:54:56,726 --> 00:55:01,629
I got some of that potted meat and
soda crackers left over, if you want some.

680
00:55:01,698 --> 00:55:06,601
I don't see how you can eat all that stuff,
with them insides it's made out of.

681
00:55:06,670 --> 00:55:09,901
Well, I reckon it tastes pretty good to me.

682
00:55:10,907 --> 00:55:13,671
I like the way you talk.

683
00:55:13,743 --> 00:55:16,075
Well, I like the way you talk.

684
00:55:19,182 --> 00:55:22,379
You think it's really
got peckers in there, cut up?

685
00:55:22,452 --> 00:55:26,889
Hey, you know better than that.
You oughta not say that word.

686
00:55:27,891 --> 00:55:31,793
- Well, it smells kinda funny.
- It's a little loud.

687
00:55:31,861 --> 00:55:37,857
Looky right there. I believe you're right.
I believe I see one right in there.

688
00:56:00,623 --> 00:56:05,720
Mister, reckon you can hand me
some of that mustard over there?

689
00:56:05,795 --> 00:56:07,956
Thank you.

690
00:56:12,502 --> 00:56:16,029
OK, Karl, the reason
that I brought you here

691
00:56:16,106 --> 00:56:20,236
is to talk to you
about something that's on my mind.

692
00:56:20,310 --> 00:56:24,940
I'm just... I'm just gonna
put it right out on the table.

693
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:27,346
Where do I start? Um...

694
00:56:29,052 --> 00:56:32,783
Linda and Frank
are very important to me.

695
00:56:32,856 --> 00:56:34,983
They're like family.

696
00:56:35,058 --> 00:56:39,791
My own family was never like a family.
They're horrible people.

697
00:56:39,863 --> 00:56:42,593
As a matter of fact,

698
00:56:42,665 --> 00:56:47,466
for years I prayed every night
that my father would die,

699
00:56:47,537 --> 00:56:50,335
and finally I realized
through a lot of therapy

700
00:56:50,407 --> 00:56:54,901
that I was wasting
my energy on hating him.

701
00:56:54,978 --> 00:56:56,377
So...

702
00:56:56,446 --> 00:56:58,641
now I just don't care.

703
00:56:58,715 --> 00:57:04,415
But, you see, you and I are a lot alike,
as strange as that may seem.

704
00:57:04,487 --> 00:57:09,720
I don't... I don't mean physically,
or even mentally, really,

705
00:57:09,793 --> 00:57:11,954
but, well, emotionally.

706
00:57:12,028 --> 00:57:16,863
Actually, the hand
that we've been dealt in life.

707
00:57:18,067 --> 00:57:22,834
We're different.
People see us as being different, anyway.

708
00:57:22,906 --> 00:57:28,003
You're... well, you've got
your affliction or whatever,

709
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:29,510
and I...

710
00:57:29,579 --> 00:57:32,412
well, mine's not as easy to see.

711
00:57:33,550 --> 00:57:35,711
I'm just going to say it.

712
00:57:35,785 --> 00:57:37,776
I'm gay.

713
00:57:38,755 --> 00:57:41,087
Does that surprise you?

714
00:57:41,991 --> 00:57:44,152
That I'm gay?

715
00:57:46,196 --> 00:57:48,790
You know what gay is, don't you?

716
00:57:49,766 --> 00:57:51,927
I don't reckon.

717
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:56,001
Homosexual.

718
00:57:56,072 --> 00:57:57,596
I like men.

719
00:57:57,674 --> 00:57:59,335
Sexually.

720
00:58:01,878 --> 00:58:05,177
Not funny ha-ha,
funny queer. Mm-hm.

721
00:58:06,416 --> 00:58:09,510
Well, that's a very
offensive way to put it.

722
00:58:09,586 --> 00:58:14,614
You shouldn't say that, Karl.
You were taught that, weren't you?

723
00:58:14,691 --> 00:58:16,784
I've heard it said thataway, yes, sir.

724
00:58:16,860 --> 00:58:22,389
Anyway, it's hard to live gay -
that's the right way to say it -

725
00:58:22,465 --> 00:58:24,456
in a small town like this.

726
00:58:24,534 --> 00:58:27,298
I've wanted to leave many times, but...

727
00:58:28,238 --> 00:58:35,906
because I love Linda, Frank,
and a certain other person,

728
00:58:35,979 --> 00:58:37,207
I...

729
00:58:37,280 --> 00:58:41,341
They've kept me from leaving.
Look, anyway, I'm rambling. The...

730
00:58:41,417 --> 00:58:44,545
If you're going to live
in the Wheatley garage,

731
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:47,112
you... you need to know
it's not going to be easy.

732
00:58:47,156 --> 00:58:49,818
Doyle is a monster.

733
00:58:49,893 --> 00:58:52,691
Not just a closed-minded redneck,
but a monster.

734
00:58:52,762 --> 00:58:55,458
A dangerous person.

735
00:58:55,532 --> 00:59:01,232
I've told Linda that one day that man
is going to hurt her and that boy.

736
00:59:01,304 --> 00:59:03,602
Maybe even kill them.

737
00:59:03,673 --> 00:59:07,234
I see it in his eyes.
I'm very in tune, maybe even psychic.

738
00:59:07,310 --> 00:59:10,541
But Doyle is going to make your life hell.

739
00:59:15,618 --> 00:59:18,883
There's... there's one more thing.

740
00:59:18,955 --> 00:59:23,688
It's none of my business
why you were in the state hospital.

741
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:26,854
Everybody has something in their past.

742
00:59:26,930 --> 00:59:28,864
Maybe...

743
00:59:28,932 --> 00:59:31,526
you tried suicide,

744
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:34,570
maybe you did something... terrible.

745
00:59:35,471 --> 00:59:38,565
But what I see before me

746
00:59:38,641 --> 00:59:43,738
is a gentle, simple man.

747
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:48,711
All I want you to promise me...

748
00:59:49,652 --> 00:59:53,713
is that you are capable of being
around Frank and Linda. You know.

749
00:59:53,790 --> 00:59:59,023
You would never hurt either one of them
under any circumstances, would you?

750
01:00:00,563 --> 01:00:03,123
I wouldn't never hurt them.

751
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:10,199
That's what I thought. OK. Look, I'm sorry
if... if I've offended you in any way.

752
01:00:10,273 --> 01:00:13,538
You seem like a thinker, you know.

753
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,704
You seem to always
be deep in thought.

754
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:21,980
Tell me something.
What are you thinking right now?

755
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:32,589
I was thinking I might wanna take me
some of these potatoes home with me.

756
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:34,892
Oh. How about before that?

757
01:00:42,005 --> 01:00:44,166
Let me think.

758
01:00:46,275 --> 01:00:48,402
Before that I was thinking

759
01:00:48,478 --> 01:00:54,075
I could use me another six or eight cans
of that potted meat, if you got any extra.

760
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:06,026
("Doyle.) Frankie, get some more salad.

761
01:01:07,530 --> 01:01:10,431
Hold your plate up for me, Frankie.

762
01:01:11,267 --> 01:01:15,397
I'm just gonna reach. So,
how come Karl won't eat here with us?

763
01:01:15,471 --> 01:01:18,929
I don't know.
He said he'd eat out there.

764
01:01:19,008 --> 01:01:21,067
I wouldn't let it get to you.
Put some of this dressing on it.

765
01:01:21,144 --> 01:01:22,634
- No, no.
- Yes.

766
01:01:22,712 --> 01:01:25,704
I just feel sorry for the poor thing.

767
01:01:27,350 --> 01:01:30,319
Who the hell could eat with him making
all that goddamn racket in his throat?

768
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:33,719
- It's raunchy.
- He does make some funny noises.

769
01:01:33,790 --> 01:01:35,690
Well, I like the way he talks.

770
01:01:35,758 --> 01:01:39,626
It sounds like a racecar motor idling.
It makes me not be nervous.

771
01:01:39,696 --> 01:01:41,721
Well, I'm glad of it, honey.

772
01:01:41,798 --> 01:01:45,063
What have you got to be nervous about?
You're a damn kid.

773
01:01:45,134 --> 01:01:47,466
You ain't got no bills to pay.

774
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:49,869
You got no business to run.
You don't even have to have a job.

775
01:01:49,939 --> 01:01:53,136
You got no old lady
eating on your ass all the time.

776
01:01:53,209 --> 01:01:56,508
Well, I don't know.
I just stay nervous.

777
01:01:58,781 --> 01:02:03,013
- Could I have some of that ham?
- Oh, yeah. I'm sorry.

778
01:02:05,388 --> 01:02:07,549
Thanks.

779
01:02:26,042 --> 01:02:28,033
You know what, by God?

780
01:02:28,111 --> 01:02:30,170
What?

781
01:02:30,246 --> 01:02:33,113
I know what I'd do tonight.

782
01:02:33,182 --> 01:02:36,515
- Oh, please, Doyle, don't.
- Mm-hm. Yeah.

783
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:40,147
I'm gonna call up Morris and have him
get the band together. We'll have a party.

784
01:02:40,223 --> 01:02:42,282
Party our asses off.

785
01:02:43,092 --> 01:02:45,424
I'd love to show them that damn Karl.
They'd get a kick out of him.

786
01:02:45,495 --> 01:02:47,122
- You know they would.
- Please, now, not tonight.

787
01:02:47,196 --> 01:02:51,565
I'm just not up for it. They always stay
till morning. I'm just give out, Doyle.

788
01:02:51,634 --> 01:02:54,296
You don't gotta do nothing, Linda.
Just put some chips in a bowl

789
01:02:54,370 --> 01:02:56,964
and run ice out to us
when we look low.

790
01:02:57,039 --> 01:03:01,373
Last time you got mad and run Morris and
them off, told them to stay away from here.

791
01:03:01,444 --> 01:03:02,809
That ain't none of your business, Frank.

792
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:06,747
Besides, that's the way
friends do one another.

793
01:03:09,318 --> 01:03:11,650
Fuck it, I'm calling 'em up.

794
01:03:15,591 --> 01:03:18,321
Linda, go out there in the garage
and get my guitar.

795
01:03:18,394 --> 01:03:21,761
- It's out there with that loony tune.
- Now?

796
01:03:22,765 --> 01:03:25,165
Yeah, now. I'm calling 'em up.

797
01:03:25,234 --> 01:03:26,758
Hey, Morris.

798
01:03:26,836 --> 01:03:29,464
What you doing, boy?

799
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:32,064
Where's Randy and them?

800
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:36,100
Yeah, now, please.
Frankie, go help your mom.

801
01:03:36,179 --> 01:03:38,147
- When are we gonna eat?
- Hang on.

802
01:03:38,214 --> 01:03:40,205
You eat when you come back.
Go get my guitar.

803
01:03:40,283 --> 01:03:42,308
Come on, sugar.

804
01:03:42,385 --> 01:03:44,376
No, I wanna get together.

805
01:03:44,453 --> 01:03:46,387
Yeah.

806
01:03:47,423 --> 01:03:48,822
Well, call him.

807
01:03:50,026 --> 01:03:52,187
("Linda.) Knock, knock.

808
01:03:53,663 --> 01:03:56,257
Karl, now, listen.

809
01:03:56,332 --> 01:03:59,733
There's gonna be a party tonight
over here at the house.

810
01:03:59,802 --> 01:04:03,738
Doyle's invited his music-playing buddies
over to get liquored up, pick fights

811
01:04:03,806 --> 01:04:07,298
and make a bunch of racket
out on the patio.

812
01:04:08,277 --> 01:04:11,440
It's on. We're gonna rock.

813
01:04:11,514 --> 01:04:14,244
Hey, Linda, call up Vaughan
and get him over here.

814
01:04:14,317 --> 01:04:16,979
I want him to be here.
I wanna show him a good time.

815
01:04:17,053 --> 01:04:20,284
No, Doyle. Vaughan don't
wanna come to a party with you.

816
01:04:20,823 --> 01:04:25,760
Too late, Linda. I already called him.
He's coming, or I'm gonna go get him.

817
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:27,125
Hey, Frankie.

818
01:04:27,196 --> 01:04:31,428
Take that tub, and you and Karl come out
here and help me ice down some beer.

819
01:04:31,500 --> 01:04:35,436
Karl, help him get that tub.
Come on, Frankie.

820
01:04:35,504 --> 01:04:37,665
Come on, Frankie.

821
01:04:45,681 --> 01:04:47,012
("Doyle.) Go ahead
and kick her off. Johnson!

822
01:04:47,083 --> 01:04:49,176
Here we go. One, two,

823
01:04:49,252 --> 01:04:50,879
one, two, three, four.

824
01:04:50,953 --> 01:04:52,944
("Shambolic playing.)

825
01:05:32,161 --> 01:05:33,856
You gotta play through it.

826
01:05:33,930 --> 01:05:36,694
When we're on a gig,
you gotta play through it. You gotta...

827
01:05:36,766 --> 01:05:39,291
- No, you play through it on a gig.
- Did you like that, Vaughan?

828
01:05:39,368 --> 01:05:43,498
Sure. It sounds like
a number one hit tune, all right.

829
01:05:43,572 --> 01:05:47,030
How about you, Karl?
Karl, did you like that?

830
01:05:47,109 --> 01:05:50,567
- I reckon.
- ("Man.) I wish you'd all lay off for tonight!

831
01:05:50,646 --> 01:05:53,740
- I can't hear myself think with that racket.
- Hey!

832
01:05:53,816 --> 01:05:56,808
- ("Man.) Well, it's nighttime. You let...
- Hey!

833
01:05:56,886 --> 01:06:00,287
- ("Man.) I'm calling the police!
- I told you three times already.

834
01:06:00,356 --> 01:06:03,325
The law's on my side.

835
01:06:03,392 --> 01:06:07,351
I play cards with JD Shelnut,
chief of police,

836
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:10,729
so kiss my ass,
you old bastard!

837
01:06:12,001 --> 01:06:13,298
Hey, Linda.

838
01:06:13,369 --> 01:06:16,634
You and Frank clean this mess up for us,
and put the tarp over these instruments.

839
01:06:16,706 --> 01:06:20,073
Me and the boys are gonna go down to the
county line. We're out of liquor and beer.

840
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:23,236
Hey, Karl, come along with us.
Vaughan, come on.

841
01:06:23,312 --> 01:06:26,713
Oh, no, I don't think so.
It's late. I-I have to work tomorrow.

842
01:06:26,782 --> 01:06:29,683
Don't be a pussy, Vaughan.
We all gotta work tomorrow.

843
01:06:29,752 --> 01:06:31,413
- Come on.
- ("Linda.) He don't want to, Doyle.

844
01:06:31,487 --> 01:06:35,856
Don't go, Vaughan, if you don't want to.
You'll wreck, Doyle. You're drunk.

845
01:06:35,925 --> 01:06:40,055
Uh-uh. I ain't gonna wreck, honey.
Come on. I'll be good, I promise.

846
01:06:40,129 --> 01:06:42,461
I love you, sweetie.

847
01:06:43,332 --> 01:06:45,266
Come on, Karl, go with us.

848
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:48,963
I'm just trying to make these two
feel like they're part of it, baby.

849
01:06:49,038 --> 01:06:51,268
Come on, Vaughan. This'll be fun.

850
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,740
Hey, Karl, let's go. Come on.

851
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:06,512
- You better lay off that tambourine.
- Hey, man, I ain't doing nothing wrong.

852
01:07:14,330 --> 01:07:15,524
Hey!

853
01:07:15,598 --> 01:07:18,294
Ain't anybody gonna come and get me?

854
01:07:20,069 --> 01:07:22,902
Not that you two afflicted son of a bitches
would know anything about this,

855
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:26,100
but you're sitting in
a crew-cab dually pickup.

856
01:07:26,175 --> 01:07:30,009
In some circles, this is considered
a piece of automotive art.

857
01:07:30,079 --> 01:07:34,709
Are you sure you can drive?
You've really had a lot of alcohol.

858
01:07:34,784 --> 01:07:38,948
When you've been drinking as long as me,
Vaughan, you build up a tolerance.

859
01:07:39,021 --> 01:07:42,149
Hide that between your legs
for me, will you?

860
01:08:03,279 --> 01:08:07,045
- Hey, Freddy. How about you?
- How about you, Doyle?

861
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:09,607
How you doing, boy? Hey.

862
01:08:09,685 --> 01:08:12,347
I saw your picture in the paper,
catching that big ass bass.

863
01:08:12,421 --> 01:08:14,753
Yeah, she was a big 'un.

864
01:08:15,758 --> 01:08:17,658
Boys.

865
01:08:17,726 --> 01:08:19,717
Hello, Freddy.

866
01:08:19,795 --> 01:08:21,126
Freddy.

867
01:08:23,232 --> 01:08:25,826
You ain't drunk driving,
are you, Doyle?

868
01:08:25,901 --> 01:08:28,893
- Yeah, pretty much.
- ("Freddy.) I figured.

869
01:08:28,971 --> 01:08:32,771
You be careful with that cripple in the back,
now. You're liable to throw him out.

870
01:08:32,842 --> 01:08:35,936
- Looks like you got a wagonful.
- Uh-huh.

871
01:08:36,011 --> 01:08:40,004
We ran out of something to drink. I'm
headed over to the county line to get some.

872
01:08:40,082 --> 01:08:42,482
You wanna race?

873
01:08:42,551 --> 01:08:45,884
You know better than that, Doyle.
We're on duty.

874
01:08:45,955 --> 01:08:49,857
But I'll catch you
next week with that 327.

875
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:52,792
Yeah, you'll try.

876
01:08:57,867 --> 01:09:00,893
What exactly are you talking about?
I don't understand.

877
01:09:00,970 --> 01:09:04,497
("Man.) Exactly the point,
my young levelheaded friend.

878
01:09:04,573 --> 01:09:08,031
- I don't get it.
- Well, I rest my case.

879
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:11,273
Morris is real smart
with philosophies and things.

880
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:14,475
That's why him and me
is the songwriting team of our group.

881
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:18,509
See, I come up with the good tunes,
or melodies as we call 'em,

882
01:09:18,587 --> 01:09:21,112
and, um, Morris is the lyrics.

883
01:09:21,190 --> 01:09:23,954
Not unlike Gary Brooker
of the Procol Harum.

884
01:09:24,026 --> 01:09:25,960
We don't ever play any songs
that y'all wrote.

885
01:09:26,028 --> 01:09:28,963
I ain't heard one of 'em.
Y'all just talk.

886
01:09:29,031 --> 01:09:32,432
We don't even play any songs
with words at all that I remember.

887
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:36,733
We ain't got no fucking microphone.
We ain't got no speaker set up.

888
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:39,535
We wrote one last night
outside the minimart,

889
01:09:39,608 --> 01:09:43,977
and, um, Morris called it
"Stuart Drives a Comfortable Car."

890
01:09:44,046 --> 01:09:49,541
And then, like in country songs,
you know, in parenthesis it says:

891
01:09:49,618 --> 01:09:52,781
"There's usually
someone in the trunk."

892
01:09:52,855 --> 01:09:55,949
And, um, I came up with a tune,
just a-hummin'.

893
01:09:56,025 --> 01:09:59,188
See, you don't wanna
question a genius, Vaughan.

894
01:09:59,261 --> 01:10:01,923
Morris here,
he's a modern-day poet,

895
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:04,227
kinda like in the olden times.

896
01:10:04,300 --> 01:10:06,734
Yeah. I got a new tune.

897
01:10:06,802 --> 01:10:11,671
This composition's entitled "The Thrill."
Goes something like this:

898
01:10:11,740 --> 01:10:14,470
"I stand on the hill

899
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:16,534
"Not for a thrill

900
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:19,809
"But for a breath of a fresh kill

901
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:23,045
"Never mind the man who contemplates

902
01:10:23,118 --> 01:10:26,110
"Doing away with license plates

903
01:10:26,188 --> 01:10:28,952
"He stands alone anyhow

904
01:10:29,024 --> 01:10:32,152
"Baking the cookies of discontent

905
01:10:32,228 --> 01:10:35,425
"By the heat of the Laundromat vent

906
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:38,128
"Leaving his soul..."

907
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:43,536
Then, like in poetry, I go dot-dot-dot,
you know, kinda off-center,

908
01:10:43,606 --> 01:10:45,972
then I drop down, and then I go:

909
01:10:46,041 --> 01:10:49,943
"Leaving his soul parting the waters

910
01:10:50,012 --> 01:10:53,413
"Of the medulla oblongata of..."

911
01:10:53,482 --> 01:10:55,279
("silly noise.)

912
01:10:55,818 --> 01:10:58,013
"...mankind"

913
01:10:58,087 --> 01:11:03,423
A damn good song, weren't it, Doyle?
You like that song? All right.

914
01:11:03,492 --> 01:11:05,392
I don't think that's right.

915
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:10,455
I believe the dot-dot-dot
come between "medulla" and "oblongata."

916
01:11:14,637 --> 01:11:18,539
- Well, it did.
- The dots are where I say they are.

917
01:11:18,607 --> 01:11:21,940
Melody and tune -
that's your trade, Terence.

918
01:11:22,011 --> 01:11:24,411
You're a tunesmith.

919
01:11:24,480 --> 01:11:26,573
I don't understand
the meaning of the words.

920
01:11:26,649 --> 01:11:29,709
If y'all don't shut up,
I'm gonna go outta my mind.

921
01:11:29,785 --> 01:11:34,586
Besides, Karl here's liable to bust a spring.
He's already off balance.

922
01:11:34,657 --> 01:11:37,820
That wasn't the way you made it up before,
Morris. That's all I know.

923
01:11:37,893 --> 01:11:42,262
We don't need no fancy words. I mean,
we need to practice. We need to rehearse.

924
01:11:42,331 --> 01:11:46,131
I'll tell you what we need.
We need some paying gigs.

925
01:11:46,201 --> 01:11:49,364
We don't need this messing around,
first on one patio and then another.

926
01:11:49,438 --> 01:11:52,498
- That's ridiculous.
- Amen, Johnson.

927
01:11:54,376 --> 01:11:57,607
We don't got no goddamn band!

928
01:11:57,680 --> 01:12:00,911
We don't need
to fucking practice, Randy!

929
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:04,513
We don't need
a shit-ass manager neither.

930
01:12:05,321 --> 01:12:09,223
You motherfuckers!
Y'all just a bunch of losers!

931
01:12:09,291 --> 01:12:13,955
I'm the only sane son of a bitch here!
Just get the fuck outta my house now!

932
01:12:14,029 --> 01:12:16,463
It's not your house, Doyle, it's Linda's.

933
01:12:16,532 --> 01:12:19,023
I'll whip the dog shit outta you, Vaughan.

934
01:12:19,101 --> 01:12:22,229
I will fucking kill you
if you talk to me again.

935
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:27,708
Now, all of you, get the fuck out now,
before I get too mad to turn back.

936
01:12:27,776 --> 01:12:30,176
What about our instruments?

937
01:12:31,146 --> 01:12:35,583
Come here, you little prick.
Come here, you fucking prick!

938
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:39,749
Get out! All of y'all!

939
01:12:39,822 --> 01:12:42,256
Now, get the fuck out!

940
01:12:42,324 --> 01:12:44,724
Come on, you motherfuckers!

941
01:12:46,595 --> 01:12:48,995
Get the fuck out!

942
01:12:49,164 --> 01:12:51,962
Randy, you tooting son of a bitch!

943
01:12:53,202 --> 01:12:55,602
Go fucking practice, Randy!

944
01:12:58,240 --> 01:13:03,177
Come on, Morris, you fucking genius,
get the fuck up and get the fuck outta here,

945
01:13:03,245 --> 01:13:05,338
goddamnit!

946
01:13:06,515 --> 01:13:11,418
This ain't right, Doyle.
There is something wrong with you.

947
01:13:11,487 --> 01:13:16,117
- Get the fuck out!
- Nobody wants to take this shit, man.

948
01:13:24,767 --> 01:13:26,598
Dots look good on paper.

949
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:30,229
You don't sing 'em anyway. You're just
showing your true Aries color now.

950
01:13:30,305 --> 01:13:34,435
Stay outta my goddamn face,
you fucking buzzard.

951
01:13:39,648 --> 01:13:40,945
Hey!

952
01:13:41,016 --> 01:13:43,951
I said, get outta my house!

953
01:13:44,019 --> 01:13:48,388
That goes for cocksuckers and retards.
Now, get up off your asses and go.

954
01:13:48,457 --> 01:13:50,482
- Come on!
- This is not your house, Doyle.

955
01:13:50,559 --> 01:13:53,687
This is my house,
and I'll say who stays and who goes.

956
01:13:53,762 --> 01:13:57,755
You got a house. Why don't you go get
one of your girlfriends and go home to it?

957
01:13:57,833 --> 01:14:01,098
You know better than to talk to me
like that when I'm hurting, Linda.

958
01:14:01,170 --> 01:14:05,539
- Don't make me knock the piss outta you.
- Don't you touch her.

959
01:14:05,607 --> 01:14:08,041
That's funny, Vaughan.

960
01:14:08,110 --> 01:14:11,807
Linda, go to bed,
and take little snot nose here with you.

961
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:14,178
You're not staying here tonight.

962
01:14:14,249 --> 01:14:18,276
Go get sober before you come back.
I'm tired of my child seeing this.

963
01:14:18,353 --> 01:14:23,381
Now, you get your ass straight,
or I'll lock your ass outta my life for good.

964
01:14:23,459 --> 01:14:27,520
If you even think about leaving me,
Linda, I told you,

965
01:14:27,596 --> 01:14:31,362
- I'm gonna kill you deader than a doornail.
- That might be better than this.

966
01:14:31,433 --> 01:14:32,957
All right, I'm a witness.
I heard you threaten her.

967
01:14:33,035 --> 01:14:36,368
- Hey! You get the fuck out now!
- Leave!

968
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:41,003
- Don't tell me what to do, Linda.
- Leave!

969
01:14:41,243 --> 01:14:42,972
- Don't tell me what to do, Linda.
- Leave!

970
01:14:43,045 --> 01:14:44,945
- Don't tell me what to do.
- Leave!

971
01:14:45,013 --> 01:14:47,675
Don't you tell me what to do, Lin...

972
01:14:47,749 --> 01:14:50,240
- Don't do that, Linda.
- I'm calling the police!

973
01:14:50,285 --> 01:14:55,552
- Goddamn you, you little prick!
- ("Shouts incoherently.)

974
01:14:55,624 --> 01:14:58,286
Go home!

975
01:14:58,360 --> 01:15:00,089
Jesus!

976
01:15:00,162 --> 01:15:02,756
Hey! Goddamn you, Frankie.

977
01:15:02,831 --> 01:15:05,425
- Get away from us!
- Goddamnit!

978
01:15:06,935 --> 01:15:09,267
God!

979
01:15:09,338 --> 01:15:11,670
Get away from us!

980
01:15:12,508 --> 01:15:13,998
All right.

981
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:15,669
OK.

982
01:15:15,744 --> 01:15:18,577
I'm gonna leave now. Fuck me!

983
01:15:20,215 --> 01:15:22,649
Fuck me!

984
01:15:22,718 --> 01:15:25,380
I'm gonna go home and sober up.

985
01:15:27,289 --> 01:15:30,019
Go on, then.

986
01:15:30,092 --> 01:15:34,222
Everything's bothering me.
I'm hurting, Linda.

987
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:37,489
- I love you.
- Well, I hate you!

988
01:15:37,566 --> 01:15:39,557
I hate you, you little prick!

989
01:15:39,635 --> 01:15:41,626
No, I don't. No, I don't.

990
01:15:41,703 --> 01:15:43,898
I love your momma.

991
01:15:44,706 --> 01:15:46,537
I just...

992
01:15:46,608 --> 01:15:49,406
I can't explain what goes on.

993
01:15:49,478 --> 01:15:52,777
You bunch of freaks,
I hope you have fun.

994
01:15:54,783 --> 01:15:57,343
I'll call you tomorrow.

995
01:15:57,419 --> 01:15:59,580
I'm sorry, honey.

996
01:16:02,124 --> 01:16:04,456
I said I'm sorry, Linda.

997
01:16:06,762 --> 01:16:08,354
OK.

998
01:16:08,430 --> 01:16:11,331
All right, you can kiss my ass.

999
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,891
And if you ever hit me again,
you little bastard,

1000
01:16:13,936 --> 01:16:17,872
I swear to God I'll make you sorry
your daddy ever squirted your ass out.

1001
01:16:17,940 --> 01:16:20,101
You hear me?

1002
01:16:39,528 --> 01:16:42,520
- You all right, Momma?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

1003
01:16:42,598 --> 01:16:45,863
Let's just try and forget about tonight.

1004
01:16:47,069 --> 01:16:49,902
We don't need to think
about bad thoughts, do we, Momma?

1005
01:16:49,972 --> 01:16:52,998
No, honey, we don't.

1006
01:16:53,075 --> 01:16:55,669
I'll make some coffee,
start cleaning up this mess.

1007
01:16:55,744 --> 01:16:58,577
Karl, you want some coffee, hon?

1008
01:16:58,647 --> 01:17:03,084
Coffee kinda makes me nervous
when I drink it. Mm-hm.

1009
01:17:17,466 --> 01:17:22,995
What are you doing up again, Frank?
You need to get a little sleep.
