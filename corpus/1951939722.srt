1
00:02:11,197 --> 00:02:12,459
Brandi!

2
00:02:15,201 --> 00:02:17,635
-He did it again.
-He did?

3
00:02:17,737 --> 00:02:20,205
I tried helping, but he keeps asking for you.

4
00:02:20,306 --> 00:02:22,433
-Yeah, he does that.
-I want Brandi!

5
00:02:23,176 --> 00:02:24,438
Brandi!

6
00:02:26,146 --> 00:02:27,943
I'm here, Mr. Binckley.

7
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:30,748
I'm here.

8
00:02:31,751 --> 00:02:33,776
Have we been bad again?

9
00:02:35,321 --> 00:02:37,653
All right. You know what to do.

10
00:02:40,827 --> 00:02:43,193
Oh, Mr. Binckley!

11
00:02:43,296 --> 00:02:46,823
-I want Brandi!
-I'm right here, Mr. Binckley.

12
00:02:46,933 --> 00:02:50,733
I'm Brandi. You know I'm Brandi.
I'm right here.

13
00:02:57,277 --> 00:03:00,405
-Mr. Binckley's all cleaned up?
-Yes, he's fine.

14
00:03:00,513 --> 00:03:02,481
We're gonna have to talk to his family.

15
00:03:02,582 --> 00:03:04,982
He is really becoming chronic.

16
00:03:05,084 --> 00:03:08,144
No, you don't have to do that.
I'm more than happy to take care of him.

17
00:03:08,254 --> 00:03:09,482
I know you are, Brandi,

18
00:03:09,589 --> 00:03:11,113
but you may not have much time

19
00:03:11,224 --> 00:03:14,022
to be spending on cases
like Mr. Binckley anymore.

20
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:16,453
What do you mean, Mrs. Petersen?

21
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:19,794
I'm considering making you
the new NA Captain.

22
00:03:19,899 --> 00:03:22,060
-The captain of the NAs?
-Yes.

23
00:03:22,168 --> 00:03:24,636
-Would you be interested?
-Yes. Very much.

24
00:03:24,737 --> 00:03:27,865
I've watched you with the residents
and with the other nursing assistants

25
00:03:27,974 --> 00:03:29,737
and I like what I see.

26
00:03:30,977 --> 00:03:33,537
Of course, this is not an official offer,

27
00:03:33,646 --> 00:03:38,106
but I wanted you to be aware
you are high on my list of possible captains.

28
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:41,517
Thank you, Mrs. Petersen.
I'll really try to do my best.

29
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:42,952
I know you will.

30
00:03:43,056 --> 00:03:45,524
Then I can count on you
coming in tomorrow?

31
00:03:45,758 --> 00:03:49,524
-Uh, Saturday?
-I know what day it is, Brandi.

32
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:51,721
Yes, of course, I know you do,

33
00:03:51,831 --> 00:03:54,891
but I came in last Saturday.

34
00:03:55,001 --> 00:03:57,026
Oh, I see.

35
00:03:57,971 --> 00:04:02,101
But, no, no, no. I can come in. It's fine.
It's no problem.

36
00:04:03,309 --> 00:04:06,244
Good, that's what I'm looking for.

37
00:04:06,346 --> 00:04:09,509
Now, don't let me keep you.

38
00:04:10,350 --> 00:04:13,410
Thank you, Mrs. Petersen. Thank you a lot.

39
00:04:18,725 --> 00:04:20,454
I'm just doing my job.

40
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,326
And I'm just asking for another week.
A couple of days even?

41
00:04:24,430 --> 00:04:26,125
This ain't a charity ward.

42
00:04:26,232 --> 00:04:28,860
Just another day. I've got a job interview.

43
00:04:28,968 --> 00:04:31,528
You vacate or I call the cops. Your choice.

44
00:04:31,638 --> 00:04:32,969
My choice?

45
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,209
What are you doing?

46
00:04:38,711 --> 00:04:39,939
Making my choice.

47
00:04:40,046 --> 00:04:42,037
You don't take anything.

48
00:04:43,182 --> 00:04:44,206
What?

49
00:04:44,317 --> 00:04:46,376
You pay or your stuff stays.

50
00:04:46,486 --> 00:04:49,683
Listen, I've got a job interview.

51
00:04:49,789 --> 00:04:52,019
Can't I at least get my good clothes?

52
00:04:53,526 --> 00:04:55,619
All right, all right, go ahead. I'll wait.

53
00:04:55,728 --> 00:04:57,662
-You'll wait?
-I'll wait.

54
00:05:29,595 --> 00:05:31,324
I'll be right back.

55
00:05:34,567 --> 00:05:36,535
What the hell are you two doing?

56
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:39,229
Yeah, well, shove it!
I don't need it, all right?

57
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:41,637
-Fucking asshole!
-Shut your mouth.

58
00:05:41,741 --> 00:05:44,335
Get back in your room
or I'm calling the cops.

59
00:05:44,977 --> 00:05:47,912
-All right, that's it. You're out of here.
-Come on.

60
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:50,414
What the hell have I got
to put up with this shit for?

61
00:05:50,550 --> 00:05:52,108
Fucking asshole!

62
00:05:53,886 --> 00:05:57,083
Get in here right away.
Yeah, they're on the third floor.

63
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:58,623
What the fuck are you doing?

64
00:06:00,326 --> 00:06:03,489
Get back here, you little fucker!
Get back here!

65
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:05,924
Fucking little bastard.

66
00:06:09,402 --> 00:06:11,870
Stop. Stop, you little fucker!

67
00:06:13,373 --> 00:06:14,533
Christ!

68
00:06:21,047 --> 00:06:22,344
Fuck it.

69
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:39,621
Please, spare change?

70
00:06:43,536 --> 00:06:44,867
Jesus!

71
00:06:44,971 --> 00:06:48,304
Why don't you watch
where the fuck you're going, you asshole?

72
00:07:01,687 --> 00:07:02,654
Hi.

73
00:07:05,691 --> 00:07:09,183
Sorry about this. Couldn't get my suitcase
and get here on time.

74
00:07:11,697 --> 00:07:15,064
I'm Thomas Bardo.
I have a 1:00 appointment.

75
00:07:15,168 --> 00:07:17,898
Take a seat. Keep all that on your person.

76
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:20,667
A seat?

77
00:07:21,641 --> 00:07:24,610
-But I have an appointment.
-Take a seat.

78
00:07:24,710 --> 00:07:29,272
But I have a 1:00 appointment
and it's 1:00 now. I was almost late.

79
00:07:29,382 --> 00:07:33,011
Sir, I don't want to have to tell you again.
Take a seat.

80
00:07:35,755 --> 00:07:37,552
-But I have...
-Sir?

81
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:44,022
All right, thank you. I'll take a seat.
Thank you.

82
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:45,722
Keep all that on your person.

83
00:07:45,832 --> 00:07:48,130
I will, of course. Thank you.

84
00:08:33,179 --> 00:08:36,307
Bradeau. Thomas Bradeau?

85
00:08:36,415 --> 00:08:39,111
Bardo. Thomas Bardo.

86
00:08:40,319 --> 00:08:41,479
This way.

87
00:08:47,994 --> 00:08:49,154
Take a seat.

88
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:53,665
Hi, I'm Thomas Bardo.
Sorry about the clothes.

89
00:08:53,766 --> 00:08:55,495
And how do you spell your name?

90
00:08:55,601 --> 00:08:57,466
B-A-R-D-O.

91
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:04,374
Yeah, you'll probably see
that I was a project manager.

92
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,502
Very challenging job,

93
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:09,945
but my company decided to downsize
just before my benefits kicked in.

94
00:09:10,049 --> 00:09:11,744
You know how that is.

95
00:09:11,851 --> 00:09:13,648
Then the unemployment ran out.

96
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:18,690
I thought I might have better luck in the city,
but... You know how that goes.

97
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:23,023
You know,
I can't seem to find you in the computer.

98
00:09:26,966 --> 00:09:29,935
All right, you take that, fill it out,
and mail it in.

99
00:09:32,271 --> 00:09:34,136
I've already filled this out.

100
00:09:34,807 --> 00:09:38,243
Well, you can't be in the computer
until you fill it out and mail it in.

101
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:42,541
But I've already mailed this in.
That's how I got the appointment.

102
00:09:42,648 --> 00:09:45,879
Well, you can't have an appointment
until you're in the computer.

103
00:09:45,985 --> 00:09:48,010
But I have an appointment, it was at 1:00,

104
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:51,283
and I've been waiting
for three and a half hours.

105
00:09:52,725 --> 00:09:54,693
But you're not in the computer.

106
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:57,891
-But...
-You're not in the computer.

107
00:09:57,997 --> 00:10:02,832
So you fill out the 976, you mail it in to me

108
00:10:03,669 --> 00:10:05,398
and I will make sure
you get an appointment.

109
00:10:06,038 --> 00:10:10,839
Look, Mr. Lieber, this hasn't been
a good day for me, you know.

110
00:10:11,177 --> 00:10:16,080
Can't you just take my word that
I've already sent this in or put me in now...

111
00:10:16,182 --> 00:10:20,243
Sir, look, if you're willing
to follow procedures, we can work with you.

112
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:21,581
If not...

113
00:10:23,122 --> 00:10:24,817
It's your choice.

114
00:10:28,027 --> 00:10:30,552
Well, I guess I'd better fill this out, huh?

115
00:10:31,864 --> 00:10:33,764
That's the procedure.

116
00:10:56,889 --> 00:10:58,413
Hey, girl.

117
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:04,195
-What are you so happy about?
-Happy?

118
00:11:04,296 --> 00:11:07,163
Yeah, you look like the cat
that got the canary.

119
00:11:07,266 --> 00:11:08,893
I got some possible good news.

120
00:11:09,001 --> 00:11:11,765
Oh, yeah? What?
I could use some right about now.

121
00:11:12,571 --> 00:11:15,540
-I don't want to say.
-Why not?

122
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:16,903
I don't want to jinx it.

123
00:11:17,009 --> 00:11:18,476
-Jinx it?
-Yeah.

124
00:11:22,515 --> 00:11:23,880
I'll let you know.

125
00:11:24,517 --> 00:11:26,178
Whatever, girl.
You going to HighLow tonight?

126
00:11:26,285 --> 00:11:29,413
-Yeah, of course.
-That's what I'm talking about. T.G.I.F.

127
00:11:29,522 --> 00:11:31,490
-Except I've got to work tomorrow.
-You do?

128
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:32,557
-Yeah.
-Why?

129
00:11:32,658 --> 00:11:34,091
Petersen needed someone.

130
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:37,094
Oh, my God. Christ, girl,
you're gonna make us all look bad.

131
00:11:37,196 --> 00:11:41,132
You should just tell Petersen that she needs
to get her fat ass in here and she needs...

132
00:11:41,233 --> 00:11:42,257
Oh, my...

133
00:11:43,703 --> 00:11:46,263
-See you tomorrow, then?
-Yes. Yes.

134
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:48,397
And, um, Tanya?

135
00:11:48,507 --> 00:11:50,668
I will be coming in on Saturday.

136
00:11:52,812 --> 00:11:54,905
Are you needing anyone to work tomorrow?

137
00:11:55,014 --> 00:11:56,709
As a matter of fact, I do.

138
00:11:56,816 --> 00:11:59,910
-Should I put you down for tomorrow?
-Sure.

139
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:04,019
Fine. We'll see you both tomorrow, then.

140
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:09,786
-Oh, my God.
-You're busted. You're busted.

141
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:11,487
-Thank you, ma'am.
-Mmm-hmm.

142
00:12:14,967 --> 00:12:16,400
She's like a fucking ghost!

143
00:12:16,502 --> 00:12:18,936
-I can't believe you said that.
-Oh, my God.

144
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,266
Shit, man.

145
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:23,974
-You think Rashid's gonna be there tonight?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

146
00:12:24,076 --> 00:12:26,340
Do you think he's gonna have any good X?

147
00:12:26,445 --> 00:12:28,242
He's Rashid.

148
00:12:28,347 --> 00:12:32,841
Cool, man, because I could really
use some tonight, girl. I really, really could.

149
00:14:08,147 --> 00:14:11,639
Don't know whether to ask you for money
or give you some.

150
00:14:13,152 --> 00:14:16,588
After the day I've had,
I'll take whatever I can get.

151
00:14:19,158 --> 00:14:21,058
I got just what you need.

152
00:14:32,004 --> 00:14:33,528
-What is it?
-Hey.

153
00:14:33,639 --> 00:14:37,040
You letting the spirits escape.
Drink it. Drink it.

154
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:45,512
-Jesus.
-Drink some more. Drink some more.

155
00:14:48,153 --> 00:14:50,178
Yeah, that's the way.

156
00:14:50,289 --> 00:14:52,280
Show the spirits you mean it!

157
00:14:53,158 --> 00:14:54,250
That's some stuff.

158
00:14:54,360 --> 00:14:55,850
That's what she said.

159
00:15:00,299 --> 00:15:03,393
Thank you, Jesus. Thank you, Lord.

160
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:04,935
And thank you.

161
00:15:05,137 --> 00:15:06,161
Sam.

162
00:15:06,705 --> 00:15:08,502
The man's called Sam.

163
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:13,508
-Tom.
-Good to know you. Good to know you.

164
00:15:13,612 --> 00:15:14,943
You, too.

165
00:15:17,349 --> 00:15:19,840
Are you thinking about
staying here tonight?

166
00:15:20,319 --> 00:15:22,048
Well, thinking about it.

167
00:15:22,154 --> 00:15:26,716
Be careful because a lot of cops come here.
There's a donut shop down there.

168
00:15:28,327 --> 00:15:30,056
Hey, I ain't shitting you, man.

169
00:15:30,162 --> 00:15:33,290
Fatboys Donuts
is the best sugar pastries in the city.

170
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:35,993
Forget about your kiss-ass creams
and all that shit.

171
00:15:36,101 --> 00:15:39,730
Fatboys is the place for the best,
and cops know it.

172
00:15:40,706 --> 00:15:43,004
Okay, Sam, thanks for the info.

173
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:45,736
-Another drink?
-No, thanks. No, thanks.

174
00:15:45,844 --> 00:15:47,209
Hey, nice lining.

175
00:15:48,580 --> 00:15:50,343
-Pardon me?
-Lining.

176
00:15:52,685 --> 00:15:54,516
Plaid's my favorite color.

177
00:15:59,358 --> 00:16:00,484
Yeah.

178
00:16:04,964 --> 00:16:07,398
-You need wheels.
-Wheels?

179
00:16:16,508 --> 00:16:18,499
-All yours.
-You don't have to.

180
00:16:18,610 --> 00:16:22,637
One thing I've learned is never say no
to something free,

181
00:16:22,748 --> 00:16:27,776
which ain't all that hard
because nothing's ever really free, right?

182
00:16:30,389 --> 00:16:32,949
-I'll see you later.
-Yeah.

183
00:16:42,668 --> 00:16:44,363
I will see you.

184
00:16:45,270 --> 00:16:46,430
Okay.

185
00:17:03,055 --> 00:17:04,682
-You have a good time.
-Thank you.

186
00:17:04,790 --> 00:17:06,223
Thank you.

187
00:17:06,325 --> 00:17:07,485
Cheers.

188
00:17:12,898 --> 00:17:15,332
Hey, how you doing? Everything all right?

189
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:19,736
Excuse me, baby.
I need to talk to your guy. Yeah.

190
00:17:19,838 --> 00:17:22,363
Listen, where's my money? My money?

191
00:17:23,909 --> 00:17:26,104
Rashid! Over here.

192
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:31,081
You better make sure you're easy to find.

193
00:17:33,352 --> 00:17:34,979
Look at you.

194
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:40,852
Hello.

195
00:17:41,627 --> 00:17:43,959
Hey, Tanya. How are you doing?

196
00:17:44,063 --> 00:17:45,963
I could be doing a lot better.

197
00:17:46,465 --> 00:17:48,160
That's what I'm here for.

198
00:17:50,569 --> 00:17:53,299
I think I'm gonna be doing a lot better
in a little while.

199
00:17:53,405 --> 00:17:55,965
Baby, open wide and trust me.

200
00:18:02,981 --> 00:18:04,209
Park's closed.

201
00:18:05,484 --> 00:18:08,078
-You can't sleep here.
-Yeah.

202
00:18:11,056 --> 00:18:13,718
There's nobody around here.

203
00:18:14,726 --> 00:18:16,990
I'm not doing anybody any harm.

204
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:19,894
-Try the Mission.
-The Mission?

205
00:18:19,998 --> 00:18:21,488
On Hope Street.

206
00:18:22,634 --> 00:18:24,568
Hope Street? But that's far.

207
00:18:24,670 --> 00:18:27,605
That's right. Come on.

208
00:18:27,706 --> 00:18:30,641
Either that or I take you in, your choice.

209
00:18:42,321 --> 00:18:44,289
Hey, don't forget your cart.

210
00:19:07,913 --> 00:19:10,074
-You okay?
-Yeah.

211
00:19:10,182 --> 00:19:13,117
-You want to ride with me?
-No.

212
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:16,184
This cold air is waking me up.

213
00:19:17,789 --> 00:19:20,121
Let's just get back to my place.

214
00:19:20,225 --> 00:19:22,591
-You got anything to drink at your place?
-Mmm...

215
00:19:23,495 --> 00:19:24,962
I got a couple of beers.

216
00:19:26,465 --> 00:19:29,059
I'm gonna stop
and pick something up. Okay?

217
00:19:29,168 --> 00:19:30,533
All right.

218
00:19:58,063 --> 00:19:59,360
Come on, start.

219
00:20:19,985 --> 00:20:21,509
-Sorry!
-Hey, what's your problem?

220
00:20:21,620 --> 00:20:22,814
Oh, baby.

221
00:20:32,864 --> 00:20:33,990
Shit.

222
00:20:35,234 --> 00:20:37,361
Should have let him take me in.

223
00:20:38,237 --> 00:20:40,705
Be some place to fucking stay.

224
00:21:03,095 --> 00:21:05,256
<i>-Hello?
-Hi, it's Brandi.</i>

225
00:21:05,864 --> 00:21:07,422
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

226
00:21:07,532 --> 00:21:10,399
Yeah, you're going to the store, right?

227
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:11,994
Yeah.

228
00:21:12,104 --> 00:21:15,972
Can you pick up some snacks,
some chips or something?

229
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:18,304
I've really got the munchies.

230
00:21:20,712 --> 00:21:23,180
Honey? Honey?

231
00:21:46,738 --> 00:21:47,932
Hello?

232
00:21:51,910 --> 00:21:53,468
Goddamn phone.

233
00:23:39,050 --> 00:23:42,281
Hey! Hey, look. That car. That car.

234
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:45,845
I know that guy. I do. He's stuck on the car.

235
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,720
The guy was stuck like a goddamn bug.

236
00:23:47,826 --> 00:23:51,193
Calm down right now
and keep those hands above your head.

237
00:23:52,097 --> 00:23:53,894
You didn't even look.

238
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:44,000
Fuck.

239
00:25:58,456 --> 00:25:59,582
Help...

240
00:26:00,559 --> 00:26:02,424
Help me, please.

241
00:26:02,527 --> 00:26:05,087
-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
-Help.

242
00:26:05,196 --> 00:26:07,858
It wasn't my fault. You should have
watched where you were going.

243
00:26:07,966 --> 00:26:09,399
Please help me.

244
00:26:10,368 --> 00:26:13,667
I'm hurt. I'm hurt bad. Please.

245
00:26:20,178 --> 00:26:22,271
-Please.
-I gotta go.

246
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,177
-Please.
-Yeah. Yeah, yeah.

247
00:26:24,282 --> 00:26:27,342
Yeah, I will. I will. I'll get help.
I'll be right back.

248
00:27:11,396 --> 00:27:13,830
-Hey, baby.
-Honey.

249
00:27:13,932 --> 00:27:16,696
Whoa, baby, what's wrong? What's wrong?

250
00:27:17,469 --> 00:27:18,697
Honey.

251
00:27:19,704 --> 00:27:21,535
I was in an accident.

252
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:22,865
An accident? You okay?

253
00:27:22,974 --> 00:27:26,273
Yeah, yeah, I'm okay, I'm okay.
But I haven't even told you yet.

254
00:27:26,378 --> 00:27:28,642
I was waiting for later,

255
00:27:28,747 --> 00:27:31,682
but I've been offered a new job,
an NA Captain job.

256
00:27:31,783 --> 00:27:34,081
It's a big promotion. It's a lot more money.

257
00:27:34,185 --> 00:27:36,244
And now this happens,
and it wasn't even my fault.

258
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:39,551
Okay, okay, okay. Wait a minute.
Just sit down, all right?

259
00:27:40,725 --> 00:27:43,057
I think you really need a drink.

260
00:27:52,303 --> 00:27:53,361
Here.

261
00:27:55,473 --> 00:27:57,737
All right, don't look at it. Drink it.

262
00:28:00,879 --> 00:28:03,871
Baby, what the fuck?
How bad was the accident?

263
00:28:12,424 --> 00:28:14,051
I hit someone.

264
00:28:15,427 --> 00:28:16,860
Oh, shit.

265
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:18,826
But it wasn't my fault.

266
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,023
Baby, it wasn't my fault.
He wasn't watching.

267
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:23,896
All right, whoa.
Slow down. Slow down. All right.

268
00:28:24,369 --> 00:28:26,030
Just relax.

269
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:28,505
Have another.

270
00:28:31,810 --> 00:28:33,243
There you go.

271
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:37,173
Okay, so you hit somebody. Bad?

272
00:28:37,282 --> 00:28:39,273
-Yeah, bad.
-Anybody see?

273
00:28:39,651 --> 00:28:41,778
-See?
-Was anybody around? Any witnesses?

274
00:28:41,886 --> 00:28:42,944
No. No.

275
00:28:43,054 --> 00:28:45,249
-You're sure?
-Yeah, I'm sure.

276
00:28:45,356 --> 00:28:46,914
You get a look at him?

277
00:28:48,326 --> 00:28:49,884
He was a bum.

278
00:28:49,994 --> 00:28:52,861
-He was a bum, a street person.
-A street person?

279
00:28:52,964 --> 00:28:54,591
Yeah, he was pushing one of those things...

280
00:28:54,699 --> 00:28:56,496
What? A cart? He was pushing a cart?

281
00:28:56,601 --> 00:28:57,625
Yeah.

282
00:28:58,369 --> 00:29:01,133
-Baby, you got nothing to worry about.
-I don't?

283
00:29:01,239 --> 00:29:03,070
No. Not at all. You hit a bum.

284
00:29:03,174 --> 00:29:05,404
Nobody saw. Nobody gonna give a shit.

285
00:29:06,845 --> 00:29:09,439
-You think?
-Look, I know.

286
00:29:09,547 --> 00:29:10,639
I've done a lot worse than that.

287
00:29:10,749 --> 00:29:12,740
-A hell of a lot worse.
-You have?

288
00:29:12,851 --> 00:29:16,810
Shit, I've done wasted assholes
in broad daylight and walked away from it.

289
00:29:17,288 --> 00:29:18,687
It's no big deal.

290
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:22,057
Now, you were able
to drive away okay, right?

291
00:29:22,527 --> 00:29:23,494
Yeah.

292
00:29:24,462 --> 00:29:27,556
Shit, then you've got
nothing to worry about.

293
00:29:27,665 --> 00:29:29,132
Nothing at all.

294
00:29:30,535 --> 00:29:31,695
Baby, look,

295
00:29:34,205 --> 00:29:37,333
you just need to relax. All right?

296
00:29:37,442 --> 00:29:38,807
Open wide.

297
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:40,977
There we go.

298
00:29:43,214 --> 00:29:45,114
You trust me, right?

299
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:46,683
There we go.

300
00:29:50,989 --> 00:29:53,253
Let me take care of you, okay?

301
00:30:00,632 --> 00:30:03,157
Cops try to pretend like they're everywhere.

302
00:30:03,902 --> 00:30:05,369
Always watching.

303
00:30:06,905 --> 00:30:08,896
Big bad eye in the sky.

304
00:30:10,909 --> 00:30:12,069
Truth is

305
00:30:13,778 --> 00:30:19,045
anybody can do anything to anyone

306
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:22,042
and get away with it.

307
00:30:23,388 --> 00:30:24,980
I mean anything.

308
00:30:25,990 --> 00:30:29,426
I mean, fuck,
look who's in the White House right now.

309
00:30:30,762 --> 00:30:33,230
You've got nothing to worry about.

310
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:38,161
Anybody gives you any trouble,
you just tell me.

311
00:30:40,071 --> 00:30:44,064
Any trouble you've got ends with me.

312
00:30:47,178 --> 00:30:49,146
All right? Come here.

313
00:32:50,435 --> 00:32:52,903
Oh, yeah, baby! Fuck, yeah!

314
00:33:00,244 --> 00:33:01,472
Help me.

315
00:33:04,449 --> 00:33:05,507
Fuck, yeah!

316
00:33:40,585 --> 00:33:42,576
So you can help me, right?

317
00:33:44,088 --> 00:33:45,988
Help you with what?

318
00:33:46,090 --> 00:33:50,049
With this accident.
If I have any trouble with this accident.

319
00:33:53,264 --> 00:33:54,322
Yeah.

320
00:33:55,266 --> 00:33:57,427
Yeah, yeah, baby. No worries.

321
00:33:58,569 --> 00:34:00,196

<i>Information. What city, please?</i>

351
00:37:52,970 --> 00:37:55,063
Providence. Coastal Cab.

352
00:38:29,073 --> 00:38:30,836
That your car?

353
00:38:31,676 --> 00:38:33,166
Yes.

354
00:38:33,277 --> 00:38:35,302
Sounds like the alarm's screwing up.

355
00:38:35,413 --> 00:38:38,211
Want me to take a look at it?
I used to install those things.

356
00:38:38,316 --> 00:38:40,876
No. Thanks. Can you wait?

357
00:38:40,985 --> 00:38:42,418
Your nickel.

358
00:38:50,394 --> 00:38:53,363
Car alarms, useless crap.

359
00:38:57,201 --> 00:38:58,566
Stop it!

360
00:38:59,403 --> 00:39:01,428
Help's coming. I told you!

361
00:39:05,076 --> 00:39:06,634
You have to stop this.

362
00:39:07,411 --> 00:39:09,038
Will you stop it?

363
00:39:25,196 --> 00:39:26,754
I said stop it!

364
00:39:48,586 --> 00:39:50,349
You fix it?

365
00:39:50,454 --> 00:39:52,854
-Car alarm?
-Oh, yes. Yes.

366
00:39:54,625 --> 00:39:56,320
You okay?

367
00:39:56,427 --> 00:39:59,555
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Yeah, I'm fine. I'm fine. Why?

368
00:39:59,663 --> 00:40:01,187
Well, you look...

369
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:03,562
Look, I can take a look at it if you like?

370
00:40:03,667 --> 00:40:08,366
No, no, no, no.
No, I'm late. For work. Come on.

371
00:40:10,007 --> 00:40:11,406
So, where do you work again?

372
00:40:31,929 --> 00:40:33,123
Mr. Binckley.

373
00:40:34,432 --> 00:40:36,332
Come on. I got you.

374
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,335
-Where's Brandi?
-I'm right here. I'm Brandi.

375
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:40,802
-I want Brandi.
-I'm right here.

376
00:40:40,905 --> 00:40:42,839
Do we have to go potty?

377
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,771
-Brandi?
-Brandi.

378
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:46,843
Gloria will take Mr. Binckley.

379
00:40:46,944 --> 00:40:48,935
-But...
-I'd like to talk to you.

380
00:40:50,781 --> 00:40:51,839
Brandi?

381
00:40:51,949 --> 00:40:55,009
Brandi is busy. Do we have to go poo-poo?

382
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,552
Walk with me.

383
00:41:00,391 --> 00:41:02,188
-This just won't do.
-I'm sorry?

384
00:41:02,293 --> 00:41:03,783
You know I'd like to promote you.

385
00:41:03,894 --> 00:41:06,089
-I'd like to give you more responsibilities.
-I want Brandi!

386
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:10,759
Yes, of course, and I look forward to it.
I really do, Mrs. Petersen. I'm grateful for it.

387
00:41:10,868 --> 00:41:14,031
-Then this just won't do, will it?
-I'm sorry.

388
00:41:14,138 --> 00:41:18,837
I can't have my NA captain coming in late,
even on the weekends. It just won't do.

389
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:21,534
-I agree. I agree.
-You agree?

390
00:41:21,645 --> 00:41:23,977
-Yes.
-But you were almost an hour late.

391
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,775
Well, because of my car.

392
00:41:27,818 --> 00:41:29,752
-I'm having problems with my car.
-Your car?

393
00:41:29,854 --> 00:41:33,449
Yeah, it's been acting up lately
and I had to take a cab.

394
00:41:33,557 --> 00:41:35,923
-I'm really not near any bus stops.
-You could have called.

395
00:41:36,026 --> 00:41:39,325
If you want more responsibilities,
you need to stay on top of things.

396
00:41:39,430 --> 00:41:40,863
Yes, I agree.

397
00:41:42,066 --> 00:41:43,431
But you didn't.

398
00:41:43,567 --> 00:41:45,432
-I didn't?
-Call.

399
00:41:45,536 --> 00:41:47,094
You didn't call.

400
00:41:47,872 --> 00:41:49,396
Are you all right?

401
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:51,702
Yes! Yes, I'm fine.

402
00:41:51,809 --> 00:41:54,437
I had to wait outside for a cab.

403
00:41:54,545 --> 00:41:57,275
-I know that's really not an excuse...
-Don't you have a cell?

404
00:41:58,382 --> 00:42:00,748
-A cell phone?
-Yes, of course.

405
00:42:00,851 --> 00:42:04,014
If you have a cell phone,
why didn't you use it?

406
00:42:07,625 --> 00:42:09,593
My God, I left it in my car.

407
00:42:34,752 --> 00:42:36,686
-Gloria, have you seen Tanya?
-Tanya?

408
00:42:36,787 --> 00:42:39,221
-Yeah, I need to see her.
-Yeah, I just saw her.

409
00:42:39,323 --> 00:42:40,950
I think she's with Mrs. Pashkowitz.

410
00:42:41,058 --> 00:42:42,719
-Mrs. Pashkowitz?
-Yeah.

411
00:42:42,826 --> 00:42:43,986
Where?

412
00:42:45,029 --> 00:42:48,362
-Are you okay?
-Of course, yes.

413
00:42:48,465 --> 00:42:51,866
-You don't look good.
-No. It, um...

414
00:42:51,969 --> 00:42:53,994
Mrs. Petersen wanted me
to tell Tanya something

415
00:42:54,104 --> 00:42:56,197
and I forgot and it's important.

416
00:42:56,307 --> 00:42:58,707
Well, like I said,
I think she's with Mrs. Pashkowitz.

417
00:42:58,809 --> 00:43:00,902
-In her room?
-Yeah.

418
00:43:01,011 --> 00:43:02,740
-Where is that again?
-Upstairs.

419
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:03,972
Thanks.

420
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,531
Oh, God.

421
00:44:57,961 --> 00:44:59,929
Now this should stop
that sock ripping incident

422
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:01,622
shouldn't it, Mrs. Pashkowitz?

423
00:45:01,732 --> 00:45:02,699
Tanya!

424
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,835
Oh, my God. Jesus Christ, Brandi!

425
00:45:05,936 --> 00:45:07,028
Mrs. Pashkowitz.

426
00:45:07,137 --> 00:45:09,230
-Is she okay?
-I don't know.

427
00:45:09,339 --> 00:45:10,397
Are you okay?

428
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:14,170
No, I'm not okay.
You just cut me, you silly stupid girl.

429
00:45:14,278 --> 00:45:16,109
I'm really, really sorry.

430
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:17,373
Oh, you're really sorry.

431
00:45:17,481 --> 00:45:19,745
Sorry is not going to stop the bleeding,
is it?

432
00:45:19,850 --> 00:45:23,786
I could get an infection. I could lose my toe.
People my age lose toes.

433
00:45:23,887 --> 00:45:26,617
No, no, no, you're not gonna lose your toe.
It's just a little nick.

434
00:45:26,724 --> 00:45:29,557
Look, missy,
whose toe are we talking about?

435
00:45:29,960 --> 00:45:32,019
I'm gonna go get a band-aid
and something to clean it up.

436
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:34,290
You just stay right there.

437
00:45:34,398 --> 00:45:36,764
Be sure to take your sweet time about it.

438
00:45:36,867 --> 00:45:39,927
Don't worry about me
bleeding to death in here!

439
00:45:40,037 --> 00:45:41,800
Where do they get these people?

440
00:45:42,539 --> 00:45:44,131
Why the hell
did you sneak up on me like that?

441
00:45:44,241 --> 00:45:45,606
I didn't mean to.

442
00:45:45,709 --> 00:45:47,643
-I need a favor.
-A favor?

443
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:50,407
Yeah. Can you cover for me?
I gotta take care of something.

444
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:52,379
-What?
-It's at home.

445
00:45:52,483 --> 00:45:55,213
-So tell Petersen.
-I can't. I'm already in hot water with her.

446
00:45:55,319 --> 00:45:56,513
Yeah, and I'm not?

447
00:45:56,620 --> 00:45:59,316
Come on, just cover for me, all right?
I'll be right back.

448
00:45:59,423 --> 00:46:01,323
Okay, what do you mean by "cover for you"?

449
00:46:01,425 --> 00:46:03,620
You know, if Petersen asks about me...

450
00:46:03,727 --> 00:46:05,217
Oh, Brandi.

451
00:46:05,929 --> 00:46:07,021
Okay.

452
00:46:08,031 --> 00:46:10,522
-Okay, fine, on one condition.
-What?

453
00:46:10,634 --> 00:46:12,101
-You lend me your car.
-My car?

454
00:46:12,202 --> 00:46:14,295
Jeez, don't shit your pants about it.

455
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:17,339
Yeah, it's just that
my car is not running right now.

456
00:46:17,441 --> 00:46:19,068
There's something wrong with it.

457
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:21,041
Yeah, I have to have it looked at.

458
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:22,840
So, can you cover for me?

459
00:46:24,648 --> 00:46:26,240
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

460
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,944
Just hurry back
and don't leave me hanging, okay?

461
00:46:29,052 --> 00:46:30,542
Cool. Thanks.

462
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,485
<i>Hello, 911 emergency.</i>

463
00:47:11,595 --> 00:47:12,823

<i>You're in a car in a garage?</i>

469
00:47:23,407 --> 00:47:24,499
A car.

470
00:47:24,708 --> 00:47:26,266
<i>Sir, is this an emergency?</i>

471
00:47:26,376 --> 00:47:29,607
Yes. Yes, an emergency.

<i>Please state
the nature of your emergency, sir.</i>

473

<i>Okay, you're stuck.</i>

475
00:47:38,088 --> 00:47:39,419
I'm hurt.

476
00:47:41,058 --> 00:47:42,787
In a window.

477
00:47:42,893 --> 00:47:45,054
<i>You mean in a garage window?</i>

478
00:47:45,162 --> 00:47:47,130
In a car windshield.

479
00:47:47,231 --> 00:47:48,198
I was hit.

480
00:47:48,298 --> 00:47:50,163
<i>Oh, I see. You were in an accident.</i>

481
00:47:50,267 --> 00:47:52,132
<i>-Yes!
-Okay.</i>

482
00:47:52,236 --> 00:47:53,931
<i>What's your location, sir?</i>

483
00:47:55,405 --> 00:47:56,633
I'm in a garage.

<i>Yes, sir, you said that.
Where is this garage located, sir?</i>

485
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:03,412
<i>-Hello?
-I don't know!</i>

486
00:48:04,414 --> 00:48:05,972
I'm inside of it.

487
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:07,710
<i>Look, sir, I can...</i>

488
00:48:09,086 --> 00:48:10,417
I'm hurt.

489
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:13,851
I'm hurt.

Help me.

494
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,009
God! God!

495
00:48:37,881 --> 00:48:39,178
Help me.

496
00:48:39,750 --> 00:48:40,978
Oh, God.

497
00:48:42,886 --> 00:48:45,013
God, help me! Help me!

498
00:48:46,556 --> 00:48:48,183
Jesus!

499
00:49:33,704 --> 00:49:34,796
Help!

500
00:51:18,241 --> 00:51:19,367
Help.

501
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:21,399
Help me!

502
00:51:24,414 --> 00:51:26,314
We come back! We come back!

503
00:51:27,417 --> 00:51:30,147
Thank you! Thank you! Thank you!

504
00:51:30,754 --> 00:51:31,914
We come back.

505
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:36,984
Oh, thank God. Thank you.

506
00:51:37,094 --> 00:51:38,652
Lord Jesus, thank you.

507
00:52:29,246 --> 00:52:30,770
I was asleep.

508
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:33,678
Thank God you came.

509
00:52:35,085 --> 00:52:37,610
That woman who hit me, she's crazy.

510
00:52:41,424 --> 00:52:42,857
You.

511
00:52:42,959 --> 00:52:45,154
Why are you doing this to me?

512
00:52:45,262 --> 00:52:46,786
Do you want to kill me?

513
00:52:46,897 --> 00:52:49,024
Just go to sleep, all right?

514
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:50,929
-Help me.
-I can't!

515
00:52:51,034 --> 00:52:52,934
You can't leave me like this.

516
00:52:53,036 --> 00:52:54,196
I have to leave.

517
00:52:54,304 --> 00:52:57,034
I'll tell them it was an accident. I will.

518
00:52:57,774 --> 00:52:59,742
You won't be in any trouble.

519
00:53:01,945 --> 00:53:04,072
Did you use this phone?

520
00:53:05,115 --> 00:53:06,946
No. The battery's dead.

521
00:53:07,050 --> 00:53:08,347
Let me go.

522
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:12,179
Let me go. Take me to a hospital.

523
00:53:12,722 --> 00:53:14,417
You can leave me a few blocks away.

524
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:16,253
You don't even have to be there.

525
00:53:16,359 --> 00:53:19,157
I don't know you.
I don't even know where I am.

526
00:53:19,262 --> 00:53:22,823
I won't tell them anything about you.
I can't tell them anything about you.

527
00:53:22,933 --> 00:53:25,128
You can't leave me like this!

528
00:53:27,737 --> 00:53:29,295
I got to go.

529
00:53:29,406 --> 00:53:30,566
Please!

530
00:53:34,077 --> 00:53:35,305
Please.

531
00:53:36,613 --> 00:53:38,205
You can't leave.

532
00:53:49,559 --> 00:53:52,357
Christ. Oh, God!

533
00:54:18,221 --> 00:54:22,021
Oh, God. Please make it stop. Oh, God.

534
00:56:20,043 --> 00:56:21,271
Rashid!

535
00:56:23,213 --> 00:56:26,011
-Baby, I thought you were working.
-Honey.

536
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:29,051
Baby, listen, I'm not feeling too well,
you know.

537
00:56:29,152 --> 00:56:30,949
Who is it, Rashid?

538
00:56:31,054 --> 00:56:32,715
Is somebody in your bedroom?

539
00:56:32,822 --> 00:56:34,050
Rashid!

540
00:56:37,160 --> 00:56:39,458
-What the fuck?
-Yeah, what the fuck?

541
00:56:39,562 --> 00:56:42,156
-Who the fuck is she?
-Yeah, who the fuck is she?

542
00:56:42,265 --> 00:56:45,234
-I asked you a question.
-And so did I.

543
00:56:45,335 --> 00:56:47,360
Will you fucking stop saying
what I'm saying?

544
00:56:47,470 --> 00:56:49,597
Who the fuck are you
to tell me what I can say?

545
00:56:49,706 --> 00:56:52,834
I'm his fucking girlfriend,
that's who the fuck I am.

546
00:56:52,942 --> 00:56:55,638
In your fucking dreams, honey.
In your fucking dreams!

547
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:57,269
-In my fucking dreams?
-Yeah.

548
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:59,678
-Yeah? Oh, yeah?
-Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah.

549
00:57:04,521 --> 00:57:06,989
Who's the bitch now,
you motherfucking skank?

550
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:08,318
Rashid!

551
00:57:08,758 --> 00:57:11,556
He's not gonna help you now,
you fucking slut.

552
00:57:13,997 --> 00:57:14,964
Ooh!

553
00:57:16,366 --> 00:57:17,628
My face!

554
00:57:19,969 --> 00:57:22,529
You know what they do
with the trash?

555
00:57:24,541 --> 00:57:26,475
What the fuck was that?

556
00:57:27,243 --> 00:57:29,507
One second, baby. One second.

557
00:57:35,885 --> 00:57:37,284
Fucking joke.

558
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:41,388
-I'll call you later.
-What?

559
00:57:41,491 --> 00:57:43,015
Yeah. I just have to...

560
00:57:43,126 --> 00:57:44,650
You bitch-ass bastard.

561
00:57:44,761 --> 00:57:46,388
Asshole!

562
00:57:48,565 --> 00:57:52,592
What the fuck are you looking at?
You lame-ass motherfucker.

563
00:57:56,906 --> 00:57:58,737
Who the hell was that?

564
00:57:58,842 --> 00:58:01,811
Her? Yeah, yeah. Her. Well...

565
00:58:03,580 --> 00:58:05,309
I'll be right back.

566
00:58:10,753 --> 00:58:12,414
Hey, baby, you want some E?

567
00:58:12,522 --> 00:58:14,149
Don't fucking give me that shit!

568
00:58:14,257 --> 00:58:16,384
-Who the fuck was she?
-She's nobody.

569
00:58:16,493 --> 00:58:17,460
Nobody?

570
00:58:17,560 --> 00:58:18,754
A customer needed a hit.

571
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:19,920
-A customer?
-Yeah.

572
00:58:20,029 --> 00:58:22,156
So your customer is fucking you
or are you fucking them?

573
00:58:22,265 --> 00:58:25,098
What, me? No. Come on.

574
00:58:25,835 --> 00:58:27,700
Why would you even say that?
You know it's only you.

575
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:28,998
-Only me.
-Yeah, only you.

576
00:58:29,105 --> 00:58:30,800
-Only me.
-Yeah, yeah. It's only you, baby.

577
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:35,405
-You okay?
-No, I'm not okay. Do I fucking look okay?

578
00:58:35,512 --> 00:58:37,605
Okay, okay, baby. Okay, calm down.

579
00:58:40,350 --> 00:58:42,682
-I need your help.
-What's wrong?

580
00:58:42,785 --> 00:58:44,150
You gotta help me.

581
00:58:44,254 --> 00:58:46,415
Yeah, sure. Sure, baby. Sure, baby.

582
00:58:47,891 --> 00:58:49,586
Help you with what?

583
00:58:50,026 --> 00:58:51,653
It's in my garage.

584
01:00:21,150 --> 01:00:22,742
What the fuck?

585
01:00:24,387 --> 01:00:25,820
He's the guy I hit.

586
01:00:26,389 --> 01:00:28,380
-The homeless guy.
-Yeah.

587
01:00:30,193 --> 01:00:32,286
I thought you said you hit a guy.

588
01:00:32,395 --> 01:00:33,794
Yeah, he's the guy.

589
01:00:33,896 --> 01:00:36,387
Yeah, but you didn't say you hit a guy
and brought him home with you.

590
01:00:36,499 --> 01:00:37,761
Help me.

591
01:00:39,235 --> 01:00:41,328
Dude, you're still alive?

592
01:00:41,437 --> 01:00:42,802
Help me.

593
01:00:42,905 --> 01:00:44,429
This is why I need your help.

594
01:00:44,540 --> 01:00:45,871
Help me.

595
01:00:46,843 --> 01:00:49,243
This is bullshit, man. Bullshit!

596
01:00:50,146 --> 01:00:52,808
Look, I don't know what to do with him.
This is why I need your help.

597
01:00:52,915 --> 01:00:54,314
My help?

598
01:00:54,417 --> 01:00:56,749
-Yeah, you said you've done this before.
-What?

599
01:00:56,853 --> 01:00:58,445
Get rid of people.

600
01:00:58,554 --> 01:00:59,851
Oh, yeah, right.

601
01:01:02,425 --> 01:01:06,486
Here's an idea.
You ever thought of calling 911?

602
01:01:06,596 --> 01:01:08,359
I can't do that, okay?

603
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:10,591
-They'll know I hit him.
-Yeah.

604
01:01:10,700 --> 01:01:12,725
I can't do that. This wasn't even my fault.

605
01:01:12,835 --> 01:01:14,302
-It wasn't?
-No!

606
01:01:17,840 --> 01:01:20,638
Look, you said
you could get rid of him, right?

607
01:01:20,743 --> 01:01:23,041
You said you could do it.
You said it would be easy.

608
01:01:23,146 --> 01:01:25,774
Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's easy. Easy as shit.

609
01:01:28,551 --> 01:01:30,917
I don't do that kind of thing for free,
you know?

610
01:01:31,020 --> 01:01:33,181
-That shit costs.
-Costs?

611
01:01:33,289 --> 01:01:35,280
Yeah, it's gonna cost big time.

612
01:01:35,391 --> 01:01:36,619
You want me to pay you?

613
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:40,287
Hey, baby, I know where you live,
you know what I'm saying?

614
01:01:40,396 --> 01:01:42,694
Yeah. Yeah, babe.

615
01:01:43,332 --> 01:01:45,698
And I know where you live,
know what I'm saying?

616
01:01:45,802 --> 01:01:47,770
Come on, Rashid!

617
01:01:47,870 --> 01:01:51,033
All the shit you got at your place.
One phone call.

618
01:01:52,241 --> 01:01:54,641
What is this, kindergarten?
You gonna tell on me?

619
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:55,836
Yeah.

620
01:01:55,945 --> 01:01:59,972
Yeah, I will. I swear to God I will.
If you don't help me with this, I will.

621
01:02:01,350 --> 01:02:02,647
Fuck, man!

622
01:02:06,756 --> 01:02:09,281
Did he get out of the car?

623
01:02:10,593 --> 01:02:12,458
Yeah, I don't know how.

624
01:02:12,762 --> 01:02:14,024
Oh, shit.

625
01:02:14,764 --> 01:02:17,699
-We'd better tie him up.
-Tie him up?

626
01:02:19,335 --> 01:02:21,200
You don't want him
crawling around everywhere.

627
01:02:21,304 --> 01:02:24,068
-No.
-Then I guess we tie him up!

628
01:02:30,046 --> 01:02:31,877
I think he passed out.

629
01:02:33,683 --> 01:02:36,675
Man, this guy is covered with blood
and dirt and crap.

630
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:42,755
You got something we can wrap him up in?

631
01:02:43,559 --> 01:02:45,584
I don't know. What?

632
01:02:45,695 --> 01:02:47,822
I don't know, plastic?

633
01:02:54,403 --> 01:02:55,802
This guy ain't going nowhere.

634
01:02:57,039 --> 01:02:58,768
-Oh, shit!
-Are you guys in there?

635
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:02,276
Oh, fuck.

636
01:03:02,912 --> 01:03:06,143
Oh, my God. Holy shit, man.
What the hell happened?

637
01:03:06,249 --> 01:03:07,944
-I was in kind of an accident.
-Kind of?

638
01:03:08,050 --> 01:03:09,108
Yeah.

639
01:03:09,218 --> 01:03:10,480
Look, why don't we go in the house, huh?

640
01:03:10,586 --> 01:03:12,486
Dude, this looks real bad.

641
01:03:12,588 --> 01:03:13,919
Yeah, it's kind of fucked up, right?

642
01:03:14,023 --> 01:03:16,355
-Major.
-Come on, let's go in the house.

643
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:20,194
Your car, what happened to it?

644
01:03:21,364 --> 01:03:24,265
-It was an accident.
-I got that. What happened?

645
01:03:24,367 --> 01:03:25,834
You know what it was?

646
01:03:27,703 --> 01:03:31,230
What's going on with you two?
What the hell happened to your car?

647
01:03:31,874 --> 01:03:33,102
It was weird.

648
01:03:33,209 --> 01:03:34,608
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

649
01:03:34,710 --> 01:03:36,473
Just wait inside. Everything is...
Just go inside.

650
01:03:36,579 --> 01:03:37,739
Okay.

651
01:03:44,754 --> 01:03:46,312
So what happened?

652
01:03:48,057 --> 01:03:50,992
-Brandi, you didn't tell her?
-No, I didn't tell her.

653
01:03:52,261 --> 01:03:53,319
Brandi hit something.

654
01:03:53,429 --> 01:03:55,727
Well, what? I mean,
there's blood all over the windshield.

655
01:03:55,832 --> 01:03:57,356
Yeah, I hit something.

656
01:03:57,466 --> 01:03:58,524
A deer.

657
01:03:58,901 --> 01:04:00,459
A deer?

658
01:04:00,570 --> 01:04:03,164
Yeah, it just came out of nowhere, didn't it?

659
01:04:04,240 --> 01:04:07,471
Yeah, it did. Out of nowhere.
Suddenly there it was.

660
01:04:07,577 --> 01:04:09,477
Oh, my God, that's horrible.

661
01:04:10,179 --> 01:04:13,080
Oh, my God, those goddamn fucking deer.

662
01:04:13,182 --> 01:04:14,809
-Crazy thing, ain't it?
-Oh, my goodness.

663
01:04:14,917 --> 01:04:18,751
You know, my aunt hit one once,
you know, God.

664
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:21,255
Thank you.
Brandi, you could have been killed.

665
01:04:21,357 --> 01:04:23,655
-Yeah, it's true.
-Yeah, yeah, I could have.

666
01:04:23,759 --> 01:04:25,693
So why didn't you tell me?

667
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:28,959
-You mean about the accident?
-Of course.

668
01:04:29,065 --> 01:04:31,465
I don't know.
I was just too freaked.

669
01:04:31,567 --> 01:04:35,469
Oh, hon, yeah. I can just imagine.

670
01:04:36,205 --> 01:04:41,040
I mean, something like this that happens
to you and it's not even your fault.

671
01:04:41,143 --> 01:04:43,509
-And you could have been killed.
-Yeah.

672
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:45,775
You know,

673
01:04:46,816 --> 01:04:48,511
this is some bullshit.

674
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,656
So, did you kill him?

675
01:04:59,362 --> 01:05:01,193
-Kill him?
-Yeah, the deer.

676
01:05:05,067 --> 01:05:08,036
She doesn't know.
It kind of crawled away, didn't it?

677
01:05:08,137 --> 01:05:09,604
Yeah, it did.

678
01:05:09,739 --> 01:05:11,263
Deer can crawl?

679
01:05:12,508 --> 01:05:14,203
Tanya, why are you here?

680
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:15,641
Oh, right.

681
01:05:17,613 --> 01:05:20,582
Okay, look, you never came back to work.

682
01:05:21,150 --> 01:05:24,085
And I tried calling your home
and I tried calling your cell

683
01:05:24,186 --> 01:05:26,154
and there was no answer.

684
01:05:28,190 --> 01:05:31,057
-Petersen knows that you split.
-She does?

685
01:05:31,160 --> 01:05:32,491
Look, I thought you were covering for me.

686
01:05:32,595 --> 01:05:34,927
I tried, but Mr. Binckley
started asking for you

687
01:05:35,031 --> 01:05:36,931
and then Petersen,
she starts looking around for you,

688
01:05:37,033 --> 01:05:39,058
then she starts asking me and...

689
01:05:39,168 --> 01:05:40,362
-You know what?
-Fuck.

690
01:05:40,469 --> 01:05:42,403
-She's really pissed off.
-Fuck.

691
01:05:42,505 --> 01:05:45,440
-But I didn't tell her that you went home.
-Shit!

692
01:05:45,541 --> 01:05:48,476
She just knows that you're gone. Sorry.

693
01:05:49,712 --> 01:05:52,510
Yo, Rashid, can you give me a lift?

694
01:05:52,815 --> 01:05:54,305
-Me?
-Yeah, you.

695
01:05:54,417 --> 01:05:55,577
-Well...
-Come on, man.

696
01:05:55,685 --> 01:05:58,176
I had to take the fucking bus to get here.
It took me an hour.

697
01:05:58,287 --> 01:06:00,881
Yeah, but, you know,
we're kind of in the middle of something.

698
01:06:00,990 --> 01:06:02,958
You know what I'm saying?

699
01:06:04,860 --> 01:06:07,351
Okay. Well, do you have any things on you?

700
01:06:08,230 --> 01:06:09,788
Yeah, always.

701
01:06:14,837 --> 01:06:16,304
-Here.
-Whoa.

702
01:06:17,206 --> 01:06:19,037
Thank you.

703
01:06:22,578 --> 01:06:27,038
But, you know,
I don't get paid until next week.

704
01:06:27,183 --> 01:06:29,811
-So you owe me.
-Yeah, I owe you.

705
01:06:33,189 --> 01:06:34,383
Tanya.

706
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:35,982
Bye.

707
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,393
Okay. Okay.

708
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,171
-Yo, Brandi, you going to work tomorrow?
-No.

709
01:06:52,274 --> 01:06:54,765
You better come up with something good
for Petersen on Monday.

710
01:06:54,877 --> 01:06:57,277
-That bitch is pissed.
-Yeah, you said.

711
01:06:57,380 --> 01:07:00,747
You know what?
I just can't believe that thing about the deer.

712
01:07:03,652 --> 01:07:04,949
What do you mean?

713
01:07:05,054 --> 01:07:08,455
Oh, man, you are so lucky.
I mean, you really could have been killed.

714
01:07:08,557 --> 01:07:10,218
-I am lucky.
-Yeah.

715
01:07:10,326 --> 01:07:12,317
Okay. I'll see you later.

716
01:07:12,428 --> 01:07:14,089
-All right.
-Bye.

717
01:07:16,098 --> 01:07:19,261
-Fuck! Fuck! God damn it!
-Be cool, baby. Be cool.

718
01:07:19,368 --> 01:07:20,767
What the hell are we gonna do?

719
01:07:20,870 --> 01:07:22,531
-She fucking saw.
-She saw the car.

720
01:07:22,638 --> 01:07:25,106
-She didn't see the body, she saw the car.
-Yeah.

721
01:07:25,207 --> 01:07:27,402
All you have to do is fix the fucking window.

722
01:07:27,510 --> 01:07:30,741
Wait a minute.
There's blood on the seats in the car.

723
01:07:30,846 --> 01:07:33,713
-Seat covers.
-Seat covers?

724
01:07:33,816 --> 01:07:35,875
All we have to do is get rid of him, right?

725
01:07:35,985 --> 01:07:37,043
Yeah.

726
01:07:37,153 --> 01:07:39,587
So we wait till dark,
dump his ass in the park.

727
01:07:39,688 --> 01:07:40,916
-What, and that's it?
-That's it.

728
01:07:41,023 --> 01:07:43,048
Out of sight, out of mind.

729
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:46,922
Baby, I've done shit like this
a thousand times. It's no big deal.

730
01:07:47,029 --> 01:07:48,394
A thousand times?

731
01:07:48,497 --> 01:07:52,024
Well, not really a thousand times.
Come on, you know what I mean.

732
01:07:52,468 --> 01:07:53,435
Look.

733
01:07:54,370 --> 01:07:58,670
We chill out for a few hours,
wait till dark, go and do the deed.

734
01:08:00,076 --> 01:08:01,839
You know what I mean?

735
01:08:03,379 --> 01:08:04,437
Okay.

736
01:08:06,182 --> 01:08:07,479
Good girl.

737
01:08:12,354 --> 01:08:14,618
Where are you going, baby girl?

738
01:08:14,723 --> 01:08:17,089
Dog, dog. Princess!

739
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:20,755
Princess, where are you?

740
01:08:20,863 --> 01:08:22,296
Princess! Princess!

741
01:08:23,599 --> 01:08:24,861
Princess!

742
01:08:28,804 --> 01:08:31,034
Princess, you come here right now.

743
01:09:08,577 --> 01:09:09,805
Princess?

744
01:09:10,713 --> 01:09:11,975
Princess?

745
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:14,808
Princess, where are you? Princess?

746
01:09:15,451 --> 01:09:17,612
Princess, you come here. Princess?

747
01:09:18,621 --> 01:09:20,088
Princess?

748
01:09:20,189 --> 01:09:23,317
Princess? There you are.
You naughty, naughty thing, you.

749
01:09:23,659 --> 01:09:27,425
You're a naughty little baby dog, aren't you?
Aren't you? Yes, you are.

750
01:09:29,331 --> 01:09:31,629
Help me! Help me, please!

751
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:35,295
Yes, you are. You're a naughty little girl.
What's got into you?

752
01:09:37,106 --> 01:09:38,266
Oh, my God.

753
01:09:39,909 --> 01:09:41,740
Where have you been?

754
01:09:41,844 --> 01:09:44,369
You've been in the garbage again,
haven't you?

755
01:09:44,480 --> 01:09:46,971
Look. Now Daddy's got to go
get us all cleaned up,

756
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:49,346
you naughty, naughty thing, you.

757
01:09:50,186 --> 01:09:54,247
Help me. I need help. Please! Fuck!

758
01:10:03,432 --> 01:10:06,128
-So how are you gonna do it?
-Do what?

759
01:10:06,235 --> 01:10:07,497
Get rid of him.

760
01:10:08,370 --> 01:10:10,338
Listen, the guy's not Superman, is he?

761
01:10:10,439 --> 01:10:12,134
I mean, how much longer
do you think he's gonna live?

762
01:10:12,241 --> 01:10:14,175
You fucked him up pretty bad, babe.

763
01:10:14,276 --> 01:10:15,607
You said you could do it.

764
01:10:15,711 --> 01:10:17,645
Yeah, yeah, I can do it.

765
01:10:17,746 --> 01:10:19,941
-So then how?
-How?

766
01:10:20,716 --> 01:10:22,206
Yeah, you said you could get rid of him,

767
01:10:22,318 --> 01:10:24,548
so why can't you tell me
how you're gonna get rid of him?

768
01:10:24,653 --> 01:10:26,450
You really want to know
how I'm gonna do it?

769
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:28,682
-Yes.
-You really want to know?

770
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:29,985
That's what I asked you!

771
01:10:30,092 --> 01:10:33,289
You want to know? Okay.
Wait right here. Just wait.

772
01:10:59,922 --> 01:11:02,049
You want to know how I'm gonna do it?

773
01:11:02,391 --> 01:11:05,485
How about doing it with this?
Think this will do it?

774
01:11:05,594 --> 01:11:06,754
Oh, yeah, great.

775
01:11:06,862 --> 01:11:09,330
You want to wake up
the whole neighborhood?

776
01:11:10,766 --> 01:11:12,131
Oh, right.

777
01:11:21,510 --> 01:11:23,569
How about we smother his ass?
Do you think that'll do it?

778
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:26,045
Just stop talking and do it.

779
01:11:26,148 --> 01:11:27,376
What, you want me to do it now?

780
01:11:27,483 --> 01:11:29,815
Yes. Do it now. It's dark outside.

781
01:11:29,918 --> 01:11:31,783
Who knows
who else is gonna come around here.

782
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:34,082
I've already got to deal with Tanya
and she's got a big mouth.

783
01:11:34,189 --> 01:11:35,588
Okay, okay, I'll do it now

784
01:11:35,691 --> 01:11:39,525
and get this motherfucking thing over with
just to shut you up! Christ!

785
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:45,991
Let me have your car keys.

786
01:11:50,105 --> 01:11:51,697
My car keys? Why?

787
01:11:51,807 --> 01:11:54,776
-So I can put him in your trunk.
-My trunk?

788
01:11:54,877 --> 01:11:58,836
We'll get rid of him and the car in the park.
We'll burn the fucker.

789
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:00,847
You want to burn my car now?

790
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:03,941
I thought you said we could fix the window
and put seat covers on.

791
01:12:04,053 --> 01:12:05,816
Seat covers? Are you fucking nuts?

792
01:12:05,921 --> 01:12:09,015
It's got his blood everywhere.
Look what happened to OJ.

793
01:12:09,491 --> 01:12:10,719
Yeah, but didn't OJ go free?

794
01:12:10,826 --> 01:12:11,918
That's not the point.

795
01:12:12,027 --> 01:12:14,894
His blood is everywhere.
You can't get rid of blood.

796
01:12:16,298 --> 01:12:17,925
Give me the keys.

797
01:12:19,468 --> 01:12:24,030
You can get another goddamn car.
I mean, you're getting a promotion, right?

798
01:13:05,047 --> 01:13:06,776
You still alive, man?

799
01:13:43,051 --> 01:13:44,416
He shot him.

800
01:13:48,891 --> 01:13:50,722
Motherfucker!

801
01:15:11,540 --> 01:15:13,508
Oh, no, he's not leaving now.

802
01:15:24,853 --> 01:15:26,013
Rashid?

803
01:15:30,058 --> 01:15:31,423
Oh, my God.

804
01:16:38,360 --> 01:16:39,657
Help!

805
01:16:42,965 --> 01:16:44,193
Help!

806
01:16:46,068 --> 01:16:47,160
Stop.

807
01:16:48,804 --> 01:16:49,771
Stop!

808
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:53,435
I'm out.

809
01:16:56,445 --> 01:16:57,639
I'm out.

810
01:16:59,047 --> 01:17:01,777
Just let me go. That's all you got to do.

811
01:17:04,219 --> 01:17:05,743
Just let me go.

812
01:17:06,421 --> 01:17:07,854
I said stop.

813
01:17:08,490 --> 01:17:09,582
Stop!

814
01:17:11,460 --> 01:17:13,894
What the fuck is wrong with you?

815
01:18:27,002 --> 01:18:30,062
-What are you doing?
-What am I doing?

816
01:18:30,172 --> 01:18:33,835
I'm not doing anything. You are.
You're doing it.

817
01:18:33,942 --> 01:18:36,536
You started it and now you're finishing it.

818
01:18:37,779 --> 01:18:38,905
What?

819
01:18:39,414 --> 01:18:43,874
You broke in. You're crazy.
You wanted to steal my car.

820
01:18:43,985 --> 01:18:46,249
But Rashid found you and he fought you.

821
01:18:46,354 --> 01:18:50,085
He broke your leg,
but you kept fighting and you killed him.

822
01:18:50,759 --> 01:18:54,593
And then you got this gas.
You got this gas to burn Rashid's body

823
01:18:54,696 --> 01:18:56,687
but the fire got out of control

824
01:18:56,798 --> 01:18:59,232
and it burned you and the car
and the garage and everything!

825
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:01,564
You did it! You did all of it!

826
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:34,432
Help me. Help me, please.

827
01:19:35,537 --> 01:19:36,504
Help me.

828
01:19:37,706 --> 01:19:40,231
-Help you?
-Help me.

829
01:19:50,852 --> 01:19:52,183
Please?

830
01:20:06,668 --> 01:20:07,726
No.

831
01:20:09,271 --> 01:20:10,602
Help me, please.

832
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:13,073
Why didn't you help me?

833
01:20:13,475 --> 01:20:14,737
I don't know.

834
01:20:14,843 --> 01:20:16,242
Why didn't you let me go?

835
01:20:16,711 --> 01:20:18,508
I don't know. I'm sorry.

836
01:20:18,914 --> 01:20:22,509
I'm sorry. Please, don't do it. Please!

837
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:24,577
Please.

838
01:20:26,288 --> 01:20:28,449
Please. Please don't do it.

839
01:21:33,722 --> 01:21:35,815
Pedro! Pedro!

840
01:21:40,695 --> 01:21:43,186
Somebody in there.
