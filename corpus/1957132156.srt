00:21:26,428 --> 00:21:29,096
If you show you're into
him, he won't be interested.

365
00:21:29,130 --> 00:21:30,399
You get it?

366
00:21:30,432 --> 00:21:31,900
Got it.

367
00:21:31,934 --> 00:21:33,035

Um, no, thanks.

371
00:21:38,307 --> 00:21:39,608
I... I don't do that.

372
00:21:39,641 --> 00:21:40,742
Okay, suit yourself.

373
00:21:40,776 --> 00:21:43,745

375
00:21:50,319 --> 00:21:51,252
Okay.

Oh my God, I'm sorry,
I didn't mean to laugh.

385
00:22:14,943 --> 00:22:15,944
That was mean.

386
00:22:15,978 --> 00:22:17,779
Not mean.

387
00:22:17,813 --> 00:22:19,281
You're fine.

388
00:22:20,949 --> 00:22:23,150
You have a little something.

389
00:22:23,619 --> 00:22:24,987
Oh.

390
00:22:28,790 --> 00:22:30,425
No, that side.

391
00:22:30,459 --> 00:22:31,660
What?

392
00:22:31,693 --> 00:22:34,195
[groans pitifully]

393
00:22:35,664 --> 00:22:36,932

Why won't you tell me
about what happened with Kev?

399
00:22:52,179 --> 00:22:55,517
I don't really want to
talk about that right now.

400
00:22:55,550 --> 00:22:57,986
I mean, [laughs] ask him
if you're so concerned.

401
00:22:58,020 --> 00:22:59,488
I did.

402
00:23:00,055 --> 00:23:02,791
He's... he's pretty
torn up about it.

403
00:23:02,824 --> 00:23:04,326
Okay.

404
00:23:06,160 --> 00:23:07,329
I'd really...

405
00:23:07,362 --> 00:23:11,232
I'd really love it if you
guys could be friends again.

406
00:23:12,701 --> 00:23:14,336
For my sake.

407
00:23:14,369 --> 00:23:15,971
Maybe just, like,
all hang out and...

I just...

411
00:23:20,842 --> 00:23:22,344
I should go.

412
00:23:22,377 --> 00:23:23,045
What?

413
00:23:23,078 --> 00:23:26,048
Where... wait, I'm your ride.

414
00:23:26,081 --> 00:23:27,549

you hear about that?

There's nothing to talk about.

And we... we didn't
even, like, go out,

we just ate our own
packed lunches in a hallway.

It wasn't... [laughs]

445
00:25:23,198 --> 00:25:25,634
You sat in the hallway
and ate your pack lunches?

00:25:26,635 --> 00:25:28,603
Sounds like a date
to me, right, Sophie?

447
00:25:28,637 --> 00:25:29,604
[Lucy] It's not a date!

448
00:25:29,638 --> 00:25:31,173

don't have to be so,

It's still crazy.

457
00:25:44,719 --> 00:25:47,155
We had sushi and then we went
to his house afterwards and his

dad was there and
we all had tea...

His dad?!

460
00:25:50,192 --> 00:25:51,294
Had tea together.

461
00:25:51,326 --> 00:25:52,494
Like a tea party?

00:25:52,527 --> 00:25:53,895
Yeah.

00:25:54,362 --> 00:25:55,298
That's so weird.

don't want all this,

467
00:26:00,836 --> 00:26:02,270

someone wants me, like,

471
00:26:09,077 --> 00:26:11,314
to meet their
dad, that's weird.

472

- I...
- So what?

477
00:26:19,855 --> 00:26:23,225
I mean, I just... I like
it being mindless more.

00:26:23,892 --> 00:26:26,828
Sophie, you know you can
talk to me about... whatever,

479
00:26:26,862 --> 00:26:27,863
right?

480
00:26:27,896 --> 00:26:29,397
I know that.

481
00:26:29,598 --> 00:26:33,235
Okay, then maybe this Tony
Robertson thing isn't such a

00:26:33,268 --> 00:26:34,870
good idea.

00:26:35,437 --> 00:26:38,341
Okay, well, what do you mean?

484
00:26:38,373 --> 00:26:39,908
I mean...

485
00:26:40,775 --> 00:26:42,377
it just seems like
ever since your mom died,

486
00:26:42,410 --> 00:26:44,679
you've turned into
this crazy nympho.

00:26:49,084 --> 00:26:51,386
I know, Sophie.

490
00:26:51,887 --> 00:26:55,590
But how many guys have you
hooked up with since January?

491
00:26:55,891 --> 00:26:56,725
Only a few.

492
00:26:56,758 --> 00:26:58,226
Yeah.

it's from literally what,

Come on, Soph, that's not
what we're talking about.

497
00:27:06,968 --> 00:27:09,037
I touched Ethan
Williams' dick, remember?

498
00:27:09,070 --> 00:27:11,039
Yeah, we all did that.

499
00:27:11,072 --> 00:27:13,108
We all touched his dick.

00:27:16,111 --> 00:27:19,481
Look, Sophie, I just
don't want you getting hurt.

501
00:27:20,115 --> 00:27:21,883
Guys are assholes.

502
00:27:21,917 --> 00:27:24,085
They don't have feelings.

503
00:27:24,287 --> 00:27:27,122
They just see us as
objects that they can fuck.

504
00:27:27,489 --> 00:27:29,658
When they come, they leave.

hooked up with even made you

What are you
even talking about?

508
00:27:36,998 --> 00:27:39,935
I mean, I'm
talking about, like,

509
00:27:39,968 --> 00:27:40,735
pleasure.

510
00:27:40,769 --> 00:27:42,103
Do you feel pleasure?

511
00:27:42,137 --> 00:27:44,072
Have any of the
guys you've been,

512
00:27:44,105 --> 00:27:46,441
like, made you feel like that?

Have they made me feel pleasure?

Yeah, they haven't, have they?

518
00:27:57,152 --> 00:27:59,288
That's not the point, Sophie.

519

All I'm saying is that
people have been talking.

520
00:28:01,623 --> 00:28:02,991
I'm just concerned.

521
00:28:03,024 --> 00:28:04,659

People in my grade and
people in your grade.

about what other people think?

524
00:28:11,300 --> 00:28:13,168
[Claire] I mean, I care what
they say about my best friend,

525
00:28:13,201 --> 00:28:14,469
yeah!

526
00:28:14,502 --> 00:28:16,504
Why wouldn't I care?

Well, I... I just don't care
what people think about me.

and you probably thought I was

724
00:41:43,945 --> 00:41:46,148
insane or
something. [giggles]

725
00:41:46,615 --> 00:41:49,451
No, I... I mean,
that was so long ago,

726
00:41:49,484 --> 00:41:50,585
so I...

727
00:41:50,619 --> 00:41:53,855
I just wanted to say,
like, I... I did want to do it.

728
00:41:54,990 --> 00:41:57,826
I mean, like... [laughs]
ah, what am I saying?!

729
00:41:57,859 --> 00:42:00,162
I just, uh... I mean,
panic attacks happen,

730
00:42:00,195 --> 00:42:00,929
right?

731
00:42:00,962 --> 00:42:01,863
You know?

732
00:42:01,897 --> 00:42:06,201
And, um, I'd like it
if we could be friends.

733
00:42:06,668 --> 00:42:07,669
If that's okay.

734
00:42:07,702 --> 00:42:08,937
[Kevin] Of course
we can be friends.

735
00:42:08,970 --> 00:42:10,338
Okay.

736
00:42:10,672 --> 00:42:13,542
I'd actually like
that a lot, so...

737
00:42:14,176 --> 00:42:15,243
Cool.

738
00:42:15,277 --> 00:42:20,215
Yeah, just... text me and
we'll... we'll hang out.

739
00:42:20,482 --> 00:42:22,951
Or we'll get
coffee or something.

740
00:42:22,984 --> 00:42:24,152
Cool.

741
00:42:24,486 --> 00:42:26,154
- [Kevin] Well, see you later.
- Okay.

742
00:42:26,188 --> 00:42:27,489
Bye.

743
00:42:32,027 --> 00:42:33,128
[Aaron] Good morning.

744
00:42:33,161 --> 00:42:33,962
Morning.

745
00:42:33,995 --> 00:42:35,363
How are you?

746
00:42:35,564 --> 00:42:37,232
Fine.

747
00:42:37,499 --> 00:42:38,967
Did you sleep okay?

748
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,303
[Lucy] Is my
hairbrush in here?

749
00:42:40,335 --> 00:42:41,403
Yeah.

750
00:42:41,837 --> 00:42:43,205
[Lucy] Thank you.

751
00:42:43,238 --> 00:42:45,140
We're almost out of toothpaste.

752
00:42:45,173 --> 00:42:46,374
Okay.

753
00:42:46,408 --> 00:42:48,844
I'll pick some up on
the way home today.

754
00:42:56,218 --> 00:42:57,986
You got it all... wet.

755
00:42:58,019 --> 00:43:00,822
Well, you don't put
your bra on the towel rack.

756
00:43:00,856 --> 00:43:03,525
- [Lucy] Such a random person.
- [Sophie] I know, it's weird.

757
00:43:03,859 --> 00:43:05,393
Hey, I was
actually wondering if,

758
00:43:05,427 --> 00:43:08,897
um, you could let me
eat lunch with you today,

759
00:43:08,930 --> 00:43:10,699
just for today.

760
00:43:11,433 --> 00:43:12,667
I don't know, Sophie.

761
00:43:12,701 --> 00:43:15,003
If I say yes today, you're just
gonna want to eat lunch with me

762
00:43:15,036 --> 00:43:16,371
and my friends every day.

763
00:43:16,404 --> 00:43:18,573
Well, you know, Claire just
left and I really don't want to

764
00:43:18,607 --> 00:43:20,408
eat lunch alone, so...

765
00:43:20,442 --> 00:43:23,411
Why can't you just make
a friend your own age?

766
00:43:23,612 --> 00:43:25,380
I don't like the
girls in my grade.

767
00:43:25,413 --> 00:43:27,549
- We've gone over this before.
- What about Riley?

768
00:43:27,883 --> 00:43:29,017
Things are weird still.

769
00:43:29,050 --> 00:43:30,518
He still hasn't apologized.

770
00:43:30,552 --> 00:43:33,054
Um, look, I have bio now, so...

771
00:43:33,088 --> 00:43:34,022
Okay.

772
00:43:34,055 --> 00:43:35,724
Please, Lucy?

773
00:43:35,957 --> 00:43:37,759
No, Sophie.

774
00:44:43,858 --> 00:44:46,628
[Kate] I think he's gonna,
you know, make the move.

775
00:44:46,661 --> 00:44:47,929
- [girl] Tonight?
- [Kate] Tonight!

776
00:44:47,963 --> 00:44:50,333
[girl] Wait, have you guys
not, like, fucked before?

777
00:44:50,366 --> 00:44:52,435
Well, no, I told you, I
wanted to take things slow.

778
00:44:52,467 --> 00:44:53,436
I thought you had.

779
00:44:53,468 --> 00:44:54,836
God, it's been, like, a while.

780
00:44:54,869 --> 00:44:55,603
What?

781
00:44:55,637 --> 00:44:57,472
I'm taking it slow.

782
00:44:57,973 --> 00:45:00,108
Hey, Kate. [chuckles]

783
00:45:00,141 --> 00:45:01,276
[Kate] Oh, hey.

784
00:45:01,310 --> 00:45:03,678
Sophie, right?

785
00:45:03,712 --> 00:45:05,680
Right. [laughs]

786
00:45:07,682 --> 00:45:11,886
So, are you guys gonna
do anything fun after school?

787
00:45:12,321 --> 00:45:16,791
Uh, yeah, we're headed to
Andrew's to smoke a bowl.

788
00:45:16,825 --> 00:45:18,327
Nice.

789
00:45:18,361 --> 00:45:19,728
- Yeah.
- Cool.

790
00:45:20,396 --> 00:45:24,499
- Yeah.
- I'll... I'll see ya later.

791
00:45:24,532 --> 00:45:25,633
[girl] See ya!

792
00:45:25,667 --> 00:45:26,634

What... what's going on here?

796
00:45:45,354 --> 00:45:46,154
I don't know. [laughs]

797
00:45:46,187 --> 00:45:47,055
What is that?

798
00:45:47,088 --> 00:45:47,889
What?

799
00:45:47,922 --> 00:45:48,890
What is this?

800
00:45:48,923 --> 00:45:50,892
I made it at camp. [laughs]

801
00:45:50,925 --> 00:45:52,861
- You made it at camp?
- Yeah.

802
00:45:52,894 --> 00:45:54,863
Do you wanna, like...

803
00:45:56,197 --> 00:45:57,500
[laughs] What?

804
00:45:57,532 --> 00:45:58,501
Move that hand back, yeah.

00:45:58,533 --> 00:46:01,370
Arch them more, and then
press more on this side.

And then take that
finger... and put it here.

807
00:46:06,941 --> 00:46:08,009
Move that there.

808
00:46:08,043 --> 00:46:09,044
Now press really hard.

809
00:46:09,077 --> 00:46:10,346

No, I have.

you're on... you're on

I asked you if...

851
00:49:49,298 --> 00:49:51,600
- Right.
- You were on birth control.

852
00:49:56,838 --> 00:49:59,341

[laughs] I'll take a Plan...

855
00:50:05,314 --> 00:50:06,914
I'll take a Plan B, so...

856
00:50:06,948 --> 00:50:08,284
All right.

857
00:50:10,619 --> 00:50:12,153
I should go.

858

Why?

It's so early.

I don't know, anything.

00:50:22,498 --> 00:50:23,599
What are you talking about?

864
00:50:23,632 --> 00:50:25,833
You just wanna fuck
me and then leave.

865
00:50:25,867 --> 00:50:27,969
Look, you wanted to
have sex this time.

866
00:50:28,002 --> 00:50:30,339
It wasn't me that
initiated it, so it's not...

867
00:50:30,372 --> 00:50:32,273
No, no, I know, but...

868
00:50:32,308 --> 00:50:34,842
[laughs] but for once, it would
be nice if we could just do

869
00:50:34,876 --> 00:50:36,779
something else after.

870
00:50:36,811 --> 00:50:38,681
It feels like we're always
having sex and then you're going

871
00:50:38,714 --> 00:50:40,214
home.

872
00:50:40,649 --> 00:50:43,319

effective if you take it right

away.

874
00:50:44,386 --> 00:50:45,621

want me getting pregnant,

Are you okay?

880
00:51:10,379 --> 00:51:12,715
I'm fine, I'm just...

882
00:51:14,683 --> 00:51:16,352
About what?

883
00:51:21,423 --> 00:51:23,191
Um...

884
00:51:24,025 --> 00:51:26,762
what's your most
terrible memory?

885
00:51:27,895 --> 00:51:29,331
I don't know.

886
00:51:29,365 --> 00:51:30,833
Why are you doing this?

887
00:51:30,898 --> 00:51:34,336
[laughs] Haven't you read that
New York Times article going

888
00:51:34,370 --> 00:51:37,905
around, "The 36
Questions That Lead to Love?"

889
00:51:37,939 --> 00:51:39,375
Yeah.

890
00:51:41,610 --> 00:51:44,245
Well, can I ask you a
couple of questions from that?

891
00:51:44,279 --> 00:51:46,281
I thought you were going home.

892
00:51:47,048 --> 00:51:49,685
It's just, like,
you're my boyfriend,

893
00:51:49,718 --> 00:51:51,587
I should, um...

894
00:51:52,954 --> 00:51:54,188
I should know
everything about you,

895
00:51:54,222 --> 00:51:55,890
right?

896
00:51:57,593 --> 00:52:00,796
Yeah, but I don't
think this is about that.

897
00:52:02,897 --> 00:52:05,534
I mean, you know my
most terrible memory.

898
00:52:05,567 --> 00:52:07,770
It's... it's only
fair that I know yours,

899
00:52:07,803 --> 00:52:08,704
right?

900
00:52:08,737 --> 00:52:10,238
I don't.

901
00:52:10,905 --> 00:52:12,641
Not really.

902
00:52:15,778 --> 00:52:17,713
Look, I know that
your mom died, okay?

903
00:52:17,746 --> 00:52:19,914
But I don't know much else.

904
00:52:20,582 --> 00:52:23,585
You haven't really
opened up to me about that.

905
00:52:24,085 --> 00:52:25,788
And hey, I really
wish you would,

906
00:52:25,821 --> 00:52:27,021
you know?

907
00:52:27,054 --> 00:52:29,991
I want you to feel comfortable
opening up to me and stuff.

908
00:52:30,258 --> 00:52:33,928
You don't open up
much either, so...

909
00:52:33,961 --> 00:52:36,164
Well, there's not much to say.

910
00:52:47,108 --> 00:52:48,943
I, um...

911
00:52:50,446 --> 00:52:52,848
I went to school...

912
00:52:53,849 --> 00:52:56,285
the day my mom died.

913
00:52:58,654 --> 00:53:03,659
I skipped all my classes and I
just... sat in the auditorium

914
00:53:03,792 --> 00:53:05,494
like all day.

915
00:53:09,030 --> 00:53:11,633
And then I went to rehearsal.

916
00:53:14,135 --> 00:53:19,006
During break, I went to get my
phone and my dad had texted me

917
00:53:19,040 --> 00:53:21,643
"Where are
you?" like 30 times.

918
00:53:22,511 --> 00:53:24,880
He just kept calling me.

919
00:53:27,048 --> 00:53:29,150
So I...

920
00:53:29,651 --> 00:53:32,354
I knew it was happening.

921
00:53:33,856 --> 00:53:37,992
So I ran home in the rain and I
pounded on the door and my aunt

922
00:53:38,025 --> 00:53:41,563
let me in, and I raced upstairs.

923
00:53:44,065 --> 00:53:46,802
She breathed a
couple of seconds more,

924
00:53:46,835 --> 00:53:49,371
like she had been
waiting for me.

925
00:53:52,908 --> 00:53:55,410
My dad cried.

926
00:53:56,912 --> 00:54:00,382
It was the first time
I had seen him cry.

927
00:54:01,182 --> 00:54:06,187
And my sister and I,
we went downstairs.

928
00:54:09,023 --> 00:54:13,829
And I took a picture of a
vase... with a white rose in it

929
00:54:13,862 --> 00:54:18,867
and some red wine in a glass.

930
00:54:21,870 --> 00:54:25,374
Then I went
upstairs to say goodbye.

931
00:54:27,241 --> 00:54:30,379
My aunt had washed her body.

932
00:54:31,914 --> 00:54:35,049
And I kissed her
on the forehead.

933
00:54:37,286 --> 00:54:39,788
Her body was yellow.

934
00:54:44,426 --> 00:54:49,431
And then the people
came to... take her away.

935
00:54:53,569 --> 00:54:58,574
My dad told me to go downstairs
but... I didn't listen,

936
00:54:58,740 --> 00:55:03,412
so I ran upstairs into my
parents' bedroom again and I

937
00:55:03,445 --> 00:55:05,647
looked out the window.

938
00:55:07,416 --> 00:55:12,421
And I saw my mom being
pushed into a black van.

939
00:55:16,157 --> 00:55:19,260
And then it just went away.

940
00:55:22,631 --> 00:55:24,165
So...

941
00:55:43,285 --> 00:55:45,454
I'm so sorry.

942
00:55:49,491 --> 00:55:51,460
Don't be.

943
00:55:56,965 --> 00:56:00,267
Hey, so when am I gonna
meet my daughters' boyfriends?

944
00:56:00,302 --> 00:56:03,105
[Lucy] Oh my God,
you have met them.

945
00:56:03,137 --> 00:56:05,974
No, I mean formally meet them.

946
00:56:06,675 --> 00:56:10,277
You know, they're... they're
always avoiding my questions.

947
00:56:10,312 --> 00:56:12,681
That's why we
don't bring them over.

948
00:56:12,981 --> 00:56:14,449
Why are we even
talking about this?

949
00:56:14,483 --> 00:56:19,488
Um, I... I signed up for
a... a dating site last week.

950
00:56:24,526 --> 00:56:27,062

mother would want for me.

956

for a short period of time?

01:05:03,546 --> 01:05:05,046
Okay, whatever that means.

1080
01:05:05,079 --> 01:05:07,550
It's fine, he's his own
person, he can do as he pleases,

1081
01:05:07,583 --> 01:05:08,517
you know?

1082
01:05:08,551 --> 01:05:09,851
Like, he's his own...

1083
01:05:09,884 --> 01:05:11,052
You're staring.

1084
01:05:11,085 --> 01:05:13,489
I'm not staring, I'm only
staring because you brought it

1085
01:05:13,522 --> 01:05:14,657
- up, so...
- Okay, okay.

1086
01:05:14,689 --> 01:05:16,157
- Okay.
- Keep... keep saying that.

1087
01:05:16,191 --> 01:05:17,326
Yeah.

1088
01:05:17,359 --> 01:05:18,360
It's fine.

1089
01:05:18,394 --> 01:05:19,495
Oh, my God.

1090
01:05:19,528 --> 01:05:20,061
[Lily] Sophie?

1091
01:05:20,094 --> 01:05:21,330
Sophie!

1092

♪ ♪

1093
01:05:32,374 --> 01:05:33,609
Hey, Sophie!

1094
01:05:34,209 --> 01:05:35,444
Sophie.

1095
01:05:41,216 --> 01:05:42,951
Um...

1096
01:05:44,052 --> 01:05:45,253
what are you doing?

1097
01:05:45,287 --> 01:05:46,087
I'm going home.

1098
01:05:46,120 --> 01:05:48,256
What does it look
like I'm doing?

1099
01:05:49,057 --> 01:05:50,892
Um...

1100
01:05:52,126 --> 01:05:53,861
are you okay?

1101
01:05:53,895 --> 01:05:55,263
[scoffs] I'm fine!

1102
01:05:55,297 --> 01:05:57,366
I'm just... I'm going home.

1103
01:05:57,399 --> 01:05:59,368
Like, why are you following me?

1104
01:05:59,401 --> 01:06:00,569
I'm not following you.

1105
01:06:00,603 --> 01:06:03,405
I mean, you just
looked upset so I...

1106
01:06:05,307 --> 01:06:07,875
I... I'm not dating
Kate, if that's...

1107
01:06:07,909 --> 01:06:09,043
I didn't even care.

1108
01:06:09,077 --> 01:06:10,713
I didn't even see you.

1109
01:06:10,745 --> 01:06:12,314
Oh, okay.

1110
01:06:12,648 --> 01:06:14,483
[laughs]

1111
01:06:14,916 --> 01:06:16,585
Okay?

1112
01:06:17,752 --> 01:06:19,588
Okay.

1113
01:06:20,322 --> 01:06:22,056
I just really want
to go home right now,

1114
01:06:22,090 --> 01:06:23,626
- so...
- Why?

1115
01:06:24,759 --> 01:06:26,729
'Cause I just
don't want to be here.

1116
01:06:26,761 --> 01:06:29,097
I don't want to be doing this.

1117
01:06:29,431 --> 01:06:30,265
[sighs]

1118
01:06:30,299 --> 01:06:31,734
Doing what?

1119
01:06:31,766 --> 01:06:33,302
I haven't d... I haven't...

1120
01:06:33,335 --> 01:06:36,838
I'm not... it's not about...
I'm not talking about you.

1121
01:06:37,005 --> 01:06:38,574
I just really want
to get out of here,

1122
01:06:38,607 --> 01:06:40,108
so...

1123
01:06:42,777 --> 01:06:43,945
What, do you think I'm...

1124
01:06:43,978 --> 01:06:45,780
Do you... do you need me to
drive you home or anything?

1125
01:06:45,813 --> 01:06:48,450
- Do you need a ride?
- You think I'm drunk?

1126
01:06:49,318 --> 01:06:50,985
I'm fine, okay?

1127
01:06:51,019 --> 01:06:53,121
I'm not gonna get
into my car and,

1128
01:06:53,154 --> 01:06:55,089
like, crash into a
pole or something.

1129
01:06:55,123 --> 01:06:56,124
I didn't say that.

1130
01:06:56,157 --> 01:06:57,626
Okay.

1131
01:06:57,792 --> 01:07:00,296
Well, I'm great, so you
don't have to worry about me.

1132
01:07:00,329 --> 01:07:01,796
Clearly.

1133
01:07:01,829 --> 01:07:03,699
You're fantastic.

1134
01:07:12,708 --> 01:07:14,142
All right.

1135
01:07:15,344 --> 01:07:16,512
Okay.

1136
01:07:16,545 --> 01:07:19,715
I'll see you back at
school or whatever.

1137
01:07:21,215 --> 01:07:22,618
[Sophie] Yeah,
happy New Year's.

1138
01:07:22,651 --> 01:07:24,218
[Kevin] Yeah, you too.

1139
01:07:28,056 --> 01:07:29,023
[Aaron] This is delicious.

1140
01:07:29,057 --> 01:07:30,459
- Mm.
- Mm-hm.

1141
01:07:30,492 --> 01:07:31,627
[Denise] I'm glad
you guys like it.

1142
01:07:31,660 --> 01:07:33,529
- [Aaron] It's wonderful.
- Thank you for bringing it.

1143
01:07:33,562 --> 01:07:35,364
Oh, you're welcome.

1144
01:07:35,397 --> 01:07:38,801
I have to tell you the truth, I
really messed up the first time

1145
01:07:38,833 --> 01:07:40,669
around and had to
throw one away.

1146
01:07:40,703 --> 01:07:42,338
[laughter]

1147
01:07:42,371 --> 01:07:44,138
Well, it was worth it.

1148
01:07:44,172 --> 01:07:45,173
You did a great job.

1149
01:07:45,206 --> 01:07:47,041
- I'm glad you like it.
- Yeah.

1150
01:07:49,678 --> 01:07:53,582
Um, so Sophie, where are you
thinking about going to college?

1151
01:07:54,849 --> 01:07:56,851
Well... [sighs]

1152
01:07:57,519 --> 01:08:01,557
I didn't really go to any
of my classes in high school.

1153
01:08:01,590 --> 01:08:05,361
Um, so I'll probably be going
to the one with the 89 percent

1154
01:08:05,394 --> 01:08:07,195
acceptance rate.

1155
01:08:07,529 --> 01:08:08,831
Which one is that?

1156
01:08:08,863 --> 01:08:12,066
It's called, um, City
Island College in New York City.

1157
01:08:12,100 --> 01:08:13,502
[Denise] Oh, that's fancy.

1158
01:08:13,535 --> 01:08:15,203
You must really love big cities.

1159
01:08:15,236 --> 01:08:16,070
Mm-hm.

1160
01:08:16,104 --> 01:08:18,172
New York is way
too crowded for me.

1161
01:08:18,206 --> 01:08:19,375
Oh, I love crowds.

1162
01:08:19,408 --> 01:08:20,875
The bigger the better, you know?

1163
01:08:20,908 --> 01:08:22,877
[all laugh]

1164
01:08:23,044 --> 01:08:25,012
[Denise] But what are you
thinking about studying?

1165
01:08:25,046 --> 01:08:27,915
Well, um, I really
would love to study acting,

1166
01:08:27,949 --> 01:08:31,854
but my father over here would
like me to study something more

1167
01:08:31,886 --> 01:08:34,590
practical like
English or History.

1168
01:08:34,623 --> 01:08:35,824
Mm-hm.

1169
01:08:35,858 --> 01:08:38,025
I just... I think it's a good
idea to have a backup plan.

1170
01:08:38,059 --> 01:08:38,926
Yeah.

1171
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:40,763
Yeah, always good
to have some plan B,

1172
01:08:40,796 --> 01:08:42,196
for sure.

1173
01:08:42,230 --> 01:08:43,632
Yup.

1174
01:08:45,933 --> 01:08:46,934
What about you, Denise?

1175
01:08:46,968 --> 01:08:48,202
What do you do?

1176
01:08:48,236 --> 01:08:50,873
Well, I teach
kindergarten but, um,

1177
01:08:50,905 --> 01:08:54,275
I actually really love to garden
and that's one of my hobbies,

1178
01:08:54,309 --> 01:08:56,412
and I actually
really like to sing,

1179
01:08:56,445 --> 01:08:57,880
too.

1180
01:08:57,912 --> 01:08:59,381
Oh, how lovely!

1181
01:08:59,415 --> 01:09:00,081
[Denise] Yeah.

1182
01:09:00,114 --> 01:09:01,550
You should sing us a tune.

1183
01:09:01,583 --> 01:09:02,785
[all laugh]

1184
01:09:02,818 --> 01:09:05,086
Uh, I think the quiche is the
only thing I'll be contributing

1185
01:09:05,119 --> 01:09:06,053
today.

1186
01:09:06,087 --> 01:09:07,589
[all laugh]

1187
01:09:07,623 --> 01:09:09,257
Mm.

1188
01:09:09,758 --> 01:09:11,427
Well, maybe another time.

1189
01:09:11,460 --> 01:09:12,226
Sure.

1190
01:09:12,260 --> 01:09:13,729
She's actually a great singer.

1191
01:09:13,762 --> 01:09:15,597
She sings for you a lot, Dad?

1192
01:09:15,631 --> 01:09:17,900
- [Aaron] No, not a lot but...
- [Denise] [giggles]

1193
01:09:17,932 --> 01:09:19,635
[Aaron] A little
bit of singing.

1194
01:09:19,668 --> 01:09:21,770
[Denise] Oh, yeah,
just... I just do it for fun.

1195
01:09:21,804 --> 01:09:24,272
Mm, nice.

1196
01:09:36,685 --> 01:09:38,019
So?

1197
01:09:38,353 --> 01:09:40,355
What do you guys think?

1198
01:09:40,823 --> 01:09:41,824
I liked her.

1199
01:09:41,857 --> 01:09:44,626
She was really pretty and nice.

1200
01:09:44,660 --> 01:09:46,093
- Good.
- Yeah.

1201
01:09:46,127 --> 01:09:46,795
Good.

1202
01:09:46,829 --> 01:09:47,995
What about you?

1203
01:09:48,029 --> 01:09:50,097
There's literally
nothing wrong with her,

1204
01:09:50,131 --> 01:09:51,633
so...

1205
01:09:52,468 --> 01:09:53,802
Well, I'm glad you liked her.

1206
01:09:53,836 --> 01:09:55,370
- Yeah.
- Good.

1207
01:09:57,972 --> 01:10:00,809
I'm glad she's
nothing like Mom.

1208
01:10:01,310 --> 01:10:03,044
What do you mean?

1209
01:10:03,378 --> 01:10:06,047
She didn't make me laugh once.

1210
01:10:11,887 --> 01:10:13,988
I'm gonna go clean up.

1211
01:10:15,022 --> 01:10:17,493
Okay, do you want our help?

1212
01:10:18,360 --> 01:10:19,828
[Aaron] I can do it.

1213
01:10:20,161 --> 01:10:22,230
- Okay, thank you.
- [Aaron] Sure.

1214
01:10:28,002 --> 01:10:32,374
[birds chirping]

1215
01:10:37,846 --> 01:10:39,915
Why did you do it?

1216
01:10:42,183 --> 01:10:43,852
Do what?

1217
01:10:44,218 --> 01:10:48,189
Tell everyone that I
tried to have sex with you.

1218
01:10:52,528 --> 01:10:54,530
I don't know, I...

1219
01:10:57,231 --> 01:10:59,902
I just... I've
liked you since, like,

1220
01:10:59,935 --> 01:11:03,739
the third... since, like,
the third grade and...

1221
01:11:04,205 --> 01:11:08,677
I guess [sighs] I just
wanted Kevin to know that...

1222
01:11:08,710 --> 01:11:11,413
That I liked you too?

1223
01:11:13,549 --> 01:11:14,917
Yeah.

1224
01:11:16,083 --> 01:11:18,252
I'm sorry, that's...

1225
01:11:18,587 --> 01:11:20,889
that's really fucked up.

1226
01:11:30,264 --> 01:11:34,369
[giggles] Maybe we
should do this. [laughs]

1227
01:11:34,403 --> 01:11:35,904
What?

1228
01:11:36,572 --> 01:11:39,206
You want... me to kiss you?

1229
01:11:39,240 --> 01:11:40,909
[giggling] Sure.

1230
01:11:41,275 --> 01:11:42,911
Okay.

1231
01:11:45,614 --> 01:11:47,916
[both giggling]

1232
01:11:47,950 --> 01:11:49,284
Okay.

1233
01:12:15,644 --> 01:12:16,912
Can I have this one?

1234
01:12:16,945 --> 01:12:18,413
[Sophie] Uh, no.

1235
01:12:18,447 --> 01:12:20,082
- [Lucy] Why?
- That's my favorite shirt.

1236
01:12:20,114 --> 01:12:21,750
[Lucy] But you never wear it.

1237
01:12:21,783 --> 01:12:25,621
It's my favorite because I only
wear it on special occasions.

1238
01:12:25,787 --> 01:12:27,589
That literally
doesn't make any sense,

1239
01:12:27,623 --> 01:12:29,358
but okay.

1240
01:12:29,791 --> 01:12:30,759
[Sophie] Stop.

1241
01:12:30,792 --> 01:12:31,927
You're not doing it right.

1242
01:12:31,960 --> 01:12:32,794
Just give it to me.

1243
01:12:32,828 --> 01:12:34,429
I'm not folding
clothes in a right way?

1244
01:12:34,463 --> 01:12:36,965
[Sophie] No, you're...
you have to roll them.

1245
01:12:36,999 --> 01:12:39,935
I have to maximize the
space in my suitcase.

1246
01:12:39,968 --> 01:12:42,104
[laughs] You have
plenty of space.

1247
01:12:42,136 --> 01:12:43,438
I'm going to New York.

1248
01:12:43,472 --> 01:12:45,974
I'm going across
the country, okay?

1249
01:12:46,008 --> 01:12:47,676
It's far away.

1250
01:12:57,218 --> 01:12:59,121
I'm gonna miss this.

1251
01:12:59,153 --> 01:13:01,023
[Sophie] Miss
what? [chuckles]

1252
01:13:01,823 --> 01:13:06,828
Our fights, your
[laughs] annoying voice...

1253
01:13:07,329 --> 01:13:08,797
[Sophie] [nasally]
My annoying voice?

1254
01:13:08,830 --> 01:13:10,164
