00:01:40,887 --> 00:01:42,555
(photographer)
<i>Beautiful.</i>

2
00:01:57,437 --> 00:01:58,738
What the fuck
you doing here?!

3
00:01:58,772 --> 00:02:00,506
- What?
- What are you doing here?

4
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:02,174
The meeting was cancelled.
I just wanted--

5
00:02:02,209 --> 00:02:03,609
The meeting was cancelled?

6
00:02:03,643 --> 00:02:04,977
I bet you
cancelled the meeting!

7
00:02:05,012 --> 00:02:06,812
We're ten days late, man!
We've got to be cranking!

8
00:02:06,847 --> 00:02:08,047
We're two weeks
away from Magic

9
00:02:08,081 --> 00:02:09,615
and you're fucking wasting
your time right here!

10
00:02:09,649 --> 00:02:11,250
I'm not wasting my time here.
What's the difference?

11
00:02:11,284 --> 00:02:12,752
The difference is that
you're here to play,

12
00:02:12,786 --> 00:02:14,520
I'm here to fucking work!
Go to the office!

13
00:02:18,058 --> 00:02:19,358
(photographer)
<i>That's nice.</i>

14
00:02:19,393 --> 00:02:20,793
<i>Look here.</i>

15
00:02:20,827 --> 00:02:23,195
<i>Beautiful.</i>

16
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:24,764
<i>Open your shoulder.</i>

17
00:02:24,798 --> 00:02:26,198
Yeah, that's nice.

18
00:02:26,233 --> 00:02:28,167
Give him a little
kiss on the cheek.

19
00:02:30,203 --> 00:02:31,604
You're selling
the American Dream.

20
00:02:31,638 --> 00:02:32,738
I think it's good work.

21
00:02:32,773 --> 00:02:33,973
- Thank you.
- Good work.

22
00:02:34,007 --> 00:02:35,408
Creative aside,
there's another issue

23
00:02:35,442 --> 00:02:36,776
I've got to talk
to you about.

24
00:02:36,810 --> 00:02:38,544
We've got 2,000
billboards, 20 markets.

25
00:02:38,578 --> 00:02:40,112
But we've gotta
close the deal today.

26
00:02:40,147 --> 00:02:41,714
Amer, how you doing?
Good to see you again.

27
00:02:41,748 --> 00:02:43,649
How you doing, man?
Good to see you.

28
00:02:43,684 --> 00:02:45,151
Let me just kinda
break it down for us.

29
00:02:45,185 --> 00:02:47,319
The nitty gritty of this is -
I've got three or four

30
00:02:47,354 --> 00:02:50,056
of our other clients that are,

31
00:02:50,090 --> 00:02:51,824
they're willing to pay
a little bit more money

32
00:02:51,858 --> 00:02:53,693
than our current deal is.

33
00:02:53,727 --> 00:02:55,327
But you're not gonna
let that happen.

34
00:02:55,362 --> 00:02:56,729
I'm not gonna
let that happen.

35
00:02:56,763 --> 00:02:58,464
We've already given you the
word, but what we need to see

36
00:02:58,498 --> 00:03:01,634
is, uh, that you can
write that check today.

37
00:03:01,668 --> 00:03:03,135
The check is
owed on Monday, man.

38
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:04,670
I've got the Frederick
Brothers on the line.

39
00:03:04,705 --> 00:03:06,105
They're ready to go
to contract at 2.5--

40
00:03:06,139 --> 00:03:08,441
Brian!
I've got 220 retailers,

41
00:03:08,475 --> 00:03:10,142
who are waiting
for this space right here.

42
00:03:10,177 --> 00:03:11,477
If I don't have
the billboards,

43
00:03:11,511 --> 00:03:13,112
they're not gonna
take my merchandise.

44
00:03:13,146 --> 00:03:14,647
I got a client ready
to put down 2.5--

45
00:03:14,681 --> 00:03:16,449
Five minutes.
Please.

46
00:03:16,850 --> 00:03:18,451
I'm gonna pay today,
but I'm not-

47
00:03:18,485 --> 00:03:20,086
I'm not happy
about it, man.

48
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:21,454
We have no choice.

49
00:03:34,334 --> 00:03:35,935
May I show you this diamond?

50
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:38,237
How much is this?

51
00:03:38,271 --> 00:03:39,572
240,000.

52
00:03:39,606 --> 00:03:41,040
Too much.

53
00:03:41,074 --> 00:03:42,575
How much is this one?

54
00:03:42,609 --> 00:03:44,710
This one is 110,000.

55
00:03:44,745 --> 00:03:46,412
Also a bit too high.

56
00:03:46,446 --> 00:03:47,913
Do you have
anything for 40?

57
00:03:47,948 --> 00:03:49,882
She's turning 40 today
and I don't want to be corny,

58
00:03:49,916 --> 00:03:52,151
but 40 would be
symbolic and right.

59
00:03:52,185 --> 00:03:55,054
This might work for you.
This is $35,000.

60
00:03:55,088 --> 00:03:56,889
It's emerald and diamonds.

61
00:03:56,923 --> 00:03:58,924
- Can I see?
- Let me show it.

62
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:03,863
And the diamonds
around are real?

63
00:04:03,897 --> 00:04:05,064
Yes.

64
00:04:05,098 --> 00:04:06,799
You can size it
to her finger?

65
00:04:06,833 --> 00:04:08,567
- I've brought her wedding band.
- Perfect.

66
00:04:08,602 --> 00:04:10,369
If you can be back
in a couple of hours,

67
00:04:10,404 --> 00:04:12,138
because tonight is her birthday
and I don't wanna miss it.

68
00:04:12,172 --> 00:04:13,539
Yeah, no problem.

69
00:04:13,573 --> 00:04:15,074
- Thank you so much.
- You're welcome.

70
00:04:15,642 --> 00:04:16,876
This is crazy.

71
00:04:16,910 --> 00:04:18,210
Amer's gonna
completely freak out.

72
00:04:18,245 --> 00:04:19,578
There's no way
he's gonna sign this.

73
00:04:19,613 --> 00:04:20,913
Listen, I'm--

74
00:04:20,947 --> 00:04:22,448
Freak about what?

75
00:04:23,083 --> 00:04:25,651
They want a
creative control provision.

76
00:04:28,622 --> 00:04:30,956
He likes to pull jokes
on me all the time.

77
00:04:30,991 --> 00:04:33,259
- Show me this.
- Amer, listen.

78
00:04:33,293 --> 00:04:35,494
They-- they changed it.

79
00:04:37,230 --> 00:04:38,698
Man, what are
you doing?

80
00:04:38,732 --> 00:04:41,133
I thought it was finished.
I thought it was done.

81
00:04:41,168 --> 00:04:43,836
I-- I tried to call you.
I tried to--

82
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:46,305
Man, you're
fucking full of shit.

83
00:04:46,340 --> 00:04:47,573
You're kidding me.

84
00:04:47,607 --> 00:04:49,008
Please don't do that.
You know, man, I'm gonna pop.

85
00:04:49,042 --> 00:04:50,443
It's a bad day to do
shit like this on me.

86
00:04:50,477 --> 00:04:51,677
Bad day.

87
00:04:51,712 --> 00:04:52,778
Mr. Atrash.

88
00:04:52,813 --> 00:04:54,180
- I'm Amer Atrash.
- I'm Gordon.

89
00:04:54,214 --> 00:04:55,514
I represent the
board of directors.

90
00:04:55,549 --> 00:04:57,183
Man, you guys are
fucking pulling a fast one

91
00:04:57,217 --> 00:04:58,818
on me right here.

92
00:04:58,852 --> 00:05:00,453
Look, we wanna be
in business with you.

93
00:05:00,487 --> 00:05:02,254
If all goes well, we're gonna
be in business by Monday.

94
00:05:02,289 --> 00:05:03,956
We are in business
already today!

95
00:05:03,990 --> 00:05:05,291
Well, there's just
one little thing.

96
00:05:05,325 --> 00:05:06,425
There's no other thing!

97
00:05:06,460 --> 00:05:07,860
- The board of directors--
- The board of directors?

98
00:05:07,894 --> 00:05:09,095
...who I represent.

99
00:05:09,129 --> 00:05:12,231
With all respect, sir.
You know, this is a done deal.

100
00:05:12,265 --> 00:05:14,000
This man has introduced
this situation as--

101
00:05:14,034 --> 00:05:16,035
Well, there was one element
that wasn't in the contract.

102
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:19,338
You're the creative person,
but just for legal purposes

103
00:05:19,373 --> 00:05:21,040
we need to say
in the contract--

104
00:05:21,074 --> 00:05:22,208
Legal purposes, sir?

105
00:05:22,242 --> 00:05:23,409
Like what?

106
00:05:23,443 --> 00:05:24,910
I'm a designer.
I'm Amer Atrash.

107
00:05:24,945 --> 00:05:26,078
We're investment bankers.

108
00:05:26,113 --> 00:05:27,513
Why do you want
creative control from me?

109
00:05:27,547 --> 00:05:28,748
What's the point?

110
00:05:28,782 --> 00:05:30,950
- It's just a necessary thing--
- Necessary for what?

111
00:05:30,984 --> 00:05:32,585
How come it wasn't
necessary yesterday afternoon

112
00:05:32,619 --> 00:05:34,186
or an hour ago when he
called me to tell me

113
00:05:34,221 --> 00:05:36,122
come get my check?

114
00:05:36,156 --> 00:05:38,190
You oversee the contracts?
See them two days ago!

115
00:05:38,225 --> 00:05:40,593
Today, an hour ago, he tells
me come pick up the check.

116
00:05:40,627 --> 00:05:41,761
I only saw it today, sir.

117
00:05:41,795 --> 00:05:43,796
Mr. Aronoff, who's our
chief legal counsel.

118
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,331
Mr. Atrash, so good
to meet you, sir.

119
00:05:45,365 --> 00:05:47,266
- I'm Amer Atrash.
- Good to meet you, sir.

120
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:48,801
I want you to
meet my attorneys.

121
00:05:48,835 --> 00:05:50,603
These are his team.
You're in good hands.

122
00:05:50,637 --> 00:05:52,772
I'm sure we'll get this done.
We'll be in business.

123
00:05:52,806 --> 00:05:55,408
This doesn't make sense, sir.
It doesn't make sense.

124
00:05:55,442 --> 00:05:57,710
These people will help
you make sense out of it.

125
00:05:57,744 --> 00:05:59,311
What's my
legal claim, Michael?

126
00:05:59,346 --> 00:06:00,946
It's not good.

127
00:06:00,981 --> 00:06:02,348
Man, go fishing alone.

128
00:06:02,382 --> 00:06:03,683
Go fishing alone!

129
00:06:03,717 --> 00:06:05,217
Go fishing alone, man.

130
00:06:05,252 --> 00:06:06,585
Come get the check
and we fish tomorrow!

131
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:07,887
Sir, please get out
of my way.

132
00:06:07,921 --> 00:06:09,955
Get out of my way,
please, sir.

133
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:12,191
I'm sorry.
I'm out of here.

134
00:06:13,093 --> 00:06:15,461
You're an attorney.
You understand--

135
00:06:15,495 --> 00:06:17,430
You have any idea
how unacceptable this is?

136
00:06:17,464 --> 00:06:18,964
You bring us up
here to a closing

137
00:06:18,999 --> 00:06:20,199
and you change the terms.

138
00:06:20,233 --> 00:06:22,368
You can't put new
language in at the closing!

139
00:06:22,402 --> 00:06:23,869
We just spent two months--

140
00:06:43,156 --> 00:06:44,790
Guys, please.

141
00:06:44,825 --> 00:06:47,059
Everybody.
Everybody's attention.

142
00:06:47,094 --> 00:06:48,761
Please, guys.

143
00:06:49,796 --> 00:06:52,631
Nobody spends any money
from any account

144
00:06:52,666 --> 00:06:55,067
until further notice.

145
00:06:55,102 --> 00:06:57,203
Small glitch.
We've had them before.

146
00:06:57,237 --> 00:07:00,039
We work around them.
Bear with me, please.

147
00:07:00,073 --> 00:07:01,807
Payroll is safe.

148
00:07:01,842 --> 00:07:04,510
It's gonna work out.
Just give me a week.

149
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:08,714
We'll make it work.

150
00:07:08,749 --> 00:07:10,416
Sorry, guys.

151
00:07:21,895 --> 00:07:24,730
Okay, no money spent
from any account

152
00:07:24,765 --> 00:07:26,365
without me knowing about it.

153
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:28,567
Please, Lisa.
No money spent.

154
00:07:28,602 --> 00:07:31,804
Confirm it to everybody.
No money spent.

155
00:07:31,838 --> 00:07:34,273
All accounts are closed
until further notice.

156
00:07:34,307 --> 00:07:35,808
Even coffee.

157
00:07:46,386 --> 00:07:47,887
Sandy, come on in please.

158
00:07:48,722 --> 00:07:50,856
- Your ring.
- Yeah, my ring.

159
00:08:08,875 --> 00:08:10,609
Is everything okay?

160
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:22,555
I just had a bit of a problem.

161
00:08:22,589 --> 00:08:24,924
I cannot buy this.

162
00:08:24,958 --> 00:08:26,992
These things happen.

163
00:08:27,027 --> 00:08:28,961
Small glitch.

164
00:08:31,465 --> 00:08:34,266
If there is any expense tied up
to the resizing of the ring,

165
00:08:34,301 --> 00:08:36,502
I want to take care
of it out of petty cash.

166
00:08:36,536 --> 00:08:38,037
I need you
at the house tonight.

167
00:08:38,071 --> 00:08:39,605
Bring the whole
rolodex with you.

168
00:08:39,639 --> 00:08:40,773
Brian's gonna
meet us there

169
00:08:40,807 --> 00:08:42,274
and we've got
some work to do.

170
00:08:42,309 --> 00:08:43,376
Thank you.

171
00:08:43,410 --> 00:08:44,810
I'm really sorry.

172
00:09:21,948 --> 00:09:23,549
Hey, there you are.

173
00:09:23,583 --> 00:09:25,384
Come here.
Sit next to me.

174
00:09:26,520 --> 00:09:27,953
What are you
so late for?

175
00:09:27,988 --> 00:09:29,155
Happy birthday, baby.

176
00:09:29,189 --> 00:09:30,423
Thank you.

177
00:09:30,457 --> 00:09:32,625
What happened?
Why are you so late?

178
00:09:33,994 --> 00:09:35,961
Small, small problem
at the office.

179
00:09:35,996 --> 00:09:37,730
- Oh.
- Baby...

180
00:09:37,764 --> 00:09:39,198
Problems are never
small for you.

181
00:09:39,232 --> 00:09:41,534
Inexcusable, baby.
Inexcusable.

182
00:09:41,568 --> 00:09:42,902
It's not right.

183
00:09:42,936 --> 00:09:44,470
It's okay, sweetheart.
You're here.

184
00:09:44,504 --> 00:09:45,738
Baby, I feel terrible.

185
00:09:45,772 --> 00:09:47,173
It's all right.

186
00:09:47,207 --> 00:09:48,674
Look at the party.
It's beautiful.

187
00:09:48,709 --> 00:09:49,975
I know, I know.

188
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:52,011
I'm having such
a good time.

189
00:09:55,449 --> 00:09:57,383
What's up?

190
00:09:59,786 --> 00:10:01,153
What's going on?

191
00:10:01,188 --> 00:10:02,955
It didn't happen.
Didn't happen.

192
00:10:02,989 --> 00:10:05,124
It's bad, right?

193
00:10:05,158 --> 00:10:06,992
It's gonna work out, baby.

194
00:10:07,027 --> 00:10:09,762
It's gonna work out.
You know me, right?

195
00:10:09,796 --> 00:10:11,931
It's your birthday, baby.
What are we talking about?

196
00:10:11,965 --> 00:10:13,699
It's your birthday--

197
00:10:13,734 --> 00:10:15,935
And I'm having a wonderful
time on my birthday.

198
00:10:15,969 --> 00:10:17,470
Yeah?

199
00:10:17,504 --> 00:10:19,739
You've got
some things to do.

200
00:10:19,773 --> 00:10:22,074
I want you to go do
what you need to do -

201
00:10:22,109 --> 00:10:24,110
and then come back.

202
00:10:25,645 --> 00:10:27,646
I know you so well.

203
00:10:28,782 --> 00:10:30,716
I know what you need.

204
00:10:30,751 --> 00:10:32,051
Go ahead.

205
00:10:32,085 --> 00:10:33,319
Go.

206
00:10:34,187 --> 00:10:35,454
Okay.

207
00:10:56,410 --> 00:10:57,410
Amer?

208
00:10:57,444 --> 00:10:58,711
Can I talk to you
for one second?

209
00:10:58,745 --> 00:10:59,779
I hope it's okay.

210
00:10:59,813 --> 00:11:01,814
I don't know what's happening,
but I organized

211
00:11:01,848 --> 00:11:04,050
this for her 40th
birthday and she's...

212
00:11:04,084 --> 00:11:05,317
not so happy tonight.

213
00:11:05,352 --> 00:11:07,620
And I think she's missed you
and you were late and...

214
00:11:07,654 --> 00:11:08,954
if you could just,
I don't know.

215
00:11:08,989 --> 00:11:10,656
I'm not--
Just cherish her tonight.

216
00:11:10,691 --> 00:11:12,892
It's her 40th birthday
and I'm stuck right here.

217
00:11:13,393 --> 00:11:14,694
Understand?

218
00:11:14,728 --> 00:11:17,063
I don't know if you get it.

219
00:11:17,097 --> 00:11:20,599
I don't know
if you get it, right?

220
00:11:20,634 --> 00:11:21,901
I'll be out there
in a little while.

221
00:11:21,935 --> 00:11:23,169
I'm sorry, yeah.

222
00:11:23,203 --> 00:11:25,404
No, don't.
I'm sorry myself.

223
00:11:25,439 --> 00:11:28,274
- She loves you.
- And I love her, too.

224
00:11:28,308 --> 00:11:30,876
Have no doubt
about it, okay?

225
00:12:14,421 --> 00:12:16,055
Don't open the curtain.

226
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:18,457
You wanna open it up, baby.
You wanna open it up.

227
00:12:19,159 --> 00:12:21,160
I don't wanna
look at that.

228
00:12:21,194 --> 00:12:23,362
You're punishing
me for last night.

229
00:12:24,197 --> 00:12:26,532
You're really upset
at me, aren't you, baby?

230
00:12:26,566 --> 00:12:29,402
I'm upset because
I'm worried about you.

231
00:12:29,436 --> 00:12:32,171
I see what this
is doing to you.

232
00:12:32,205 --> 00:12:33,439
The look on your face
when you walked

233
00:12:33,473 --> 00:12:36,242
into that party last night...
My God, it's heartbreaking.

234
00:12:36,276 --> 00:12:38,611
That was yesterday, baby.
Today's okay.

235
00:12:38,645 --> 00:12:40,546
- I know, but--
- Today's okay.

236
00:12:40,580 --> 00:12:42,682
I took a blow yesterday
at the office.

237
00:12:42,716 --> 00:12:44,417
You've taken
a lot of blows.

238
00:12:44,451 --> 00:12:46,085
But who do you
think I'm doing this for?

239
00:12:46,119 --> 00:12:47,920
Who do you think
I'm doing this for, my love?

240
00:12:47,954 --> 00:12:49,455
Don't do this for me.

241
00:12:49,489 --> 00:12:52,358
Well, I'm doing it for you
and Charley, too, baby.

242
00:12:52,392 --> 00:12:54,260
It's not just for you.
It's for all of us, baby.

243
00:12:54,294 --> 00:12:55,528
I wanna be able, one day,

244
00:12:55,562 --> 00:12:57,229
to kick back
and smell the roses.

245
00:12:57,264 --> 00:12:58,931
I wanna sit with you
in a chair and say,

246
00:12:58,965 --> 00:13:01,600
okay, we've done okay.
We're fine.

247
00:13:01,635 --> 00:13:04,570
We don't need to put up
with any bullshit anymore.

248
00:13:04,604 --> 00:13:06,772
I wanna sit down one day
and basically see that--

249
00:13:06,807 --> 00:13:08,908
One day?

250
00:13:08,942 --> 00:13:12,111
Look, I don't wanna put
more pressure on you,

251
00:13:12,145 --> 00:13:13,779
and I love you.

252
00:13:13,814 --> 00:13:16,582
But we've gotta sit down
like that once in while now.

253
00:13:21,221 --> 00:13:23,189
Oh, my God.
Look who's here.

254
00:13:23,223 --> 00:13:24,790
Dadula?

255
00:13:24,825 --> 00:13:26,225
Robin...

256
00:13:26,259 --> 00:13:27,593
You want Robin?

257
00:13:27,627 --> 00:13:28,794
Say hi.

258
00:13:28,829 --> 00:13:30,296
Dadula.

259
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:31,931
Dadula is here.

260
00:13:31,965 --> 00:13:33,866
Dada, can you get Robin?

261
00:13:33,900 --> 00:13:36,102
- Ow.
- Owie, what?

262
00:13:36,136 --> 00:13:37,503
Your hand has a boo-boo?

263
00:13:37,537 --> 00:13:38,671
Show me.

264
00:13:38,705 --> 00:13:40,373
I should kiss it again?

265
00:13:41,274 --> 00:13:42,441
What?

266
00:13:42,476 --> 00:13:44,744
Could you <i>please</i>
<i>just get Robin?</i>

267
00:13:44,778 --> 00:13:47,146
But you don't
wanna play with Dada?

268
00:13:47,180 --> 00:13:48,814
No?

269
00:13:48,849 --> 00:13:52,618
Tomorrow.
Will you get Robin?

270
00:13:52,652 --> 00:13:53,886
You know what?

271
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:55,654
Why don't we
go find Robin.

272
00:13:55,689 --> 00:13:57,490
I think she's
in your room.

273
00:13:57,524 --> 00:14:00,259
And then we can
come back later.

274
00:14:00,293 --> 00:14:02,094
Come on, sweetie.

275
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,931
Oh, it's okay.

276
00:14:05,966 --> 00:14:06,966
It's all right.

277
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:08,267
I spilled some juice.

278
00:14:08,301 --> 00:14:09,502
It's okay.

279
00:14:09,536 --> 00:14:12,104
Come on.
Let's go get that cleaned up.

280
00:14:12,139 --> 00:14:14,006
It's a bit of juice
I spilled on you.

281
00:14:14,041 --> 00:14:15,508
It's okay.

282
00:14:15,542 --> 00:14:17,343
It's just that
it's her favorite -

283
00:14:17,377 --> 00:14:18,878
her favorite dress.

284
00:14:18,912 --> 00:14:20,446
It's okay, honey.

285
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:22,348
Here, take your juice.

286
00:14:32,793 --> 00:14:34,260
Listen...

287
00:14:34,294 --> 00:14:37,763
Robin is
her imaginary friend.

288
00:14:37,798 --> 00:14:39,532
And I'm Dada.

289
00:14:39,566 --> 00:14:41,233
I'm Dada.

290
00:14:41,268 --> 00:14:44,403
I know.
But she misses her Dada, okay?

291
00:14:44,438 --> 00:14:46,806
She misses him a lot.

292
00:14:46,840 --> 00:14:48,708
So, she's four.

293
00:14:48,742 --> 00:14:50,209
I know.

294
00:14:51,144 --> 00:14:52,878
And she's just playing
a little game with you.

295
00:14:52,913 --> 00:14:54,180
She's trying
to punish you.

296
00:14:54,214 --> 00:14:55,981
I'm gonna go
play with her.

297
00:14:56,016 --> 00:14:57,416
- I'm gonna go.
- It's all right.

298
00:15:13,367 --> 00:15:15,001
<i>[doorbell rings]</i>

299
00:15:25,045 --> 00:15:26,846
I am an immigrant.

300
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:28,047
Don't make fun of me.

301
00:15:28,081 --> 00:15:29,315
I have a dream.

302
00:15:29,349 --> 00:15:31,484
- It's been a long time.
- Fifteen years.

303
00:15:31,518 --> 00:15:33,119
Fifteen years, man.

304
00:15:33,587 --> 00:15:35,154
Look at you.

305
00:15:35,188 --> 00:15:36,756
You're a model.

306
00:15:36,790 --> 00:15:37,823
That's my stuff.

307
00:15:37,858 --> 00:15:40,059
So, I read it.

308
00:15:40,093 --> 00:15:41,360
It's impressive.

309
00:15:41,395 --> 00:15:42,528
Thank you.

310
00:15:42,562 --> 00:15:44,830
I don't get it,
but I like it.

311
00:15:44,865 --> 00:15:46,265
It's all pockets.

312
00:15:46,299 --> 00:15:47,433
You're making fun of me.

313
00:15:47,467 --> 00:15:50,369
- I'm making fun of you.
- It's good to see you, man.

314
00:15:50,404 --> 00:15:52,638
It's good to see you.

315
00:15:52,673 --> 00:15:55,274
Remember the last
time we saw each other?

316
00:15:55,308 --> 00:15:57,476
Granada?

317
00:15:57,511 --> 00:15:59,512
That little place
with the sardines?

318
00:15:59,546 --> 00:16:01,080
You were surrounded by--

319
00:16:01,114 --> 00:16:02,515
<i>We</i> were surrounded--

320
00:16:02,549 --> 00:16:04,884
<i>You</i> were surrounded by
15 or 20 beautiful,

321
00:16:04,918 --> 00:16:07,653
young señoritas and then
you were just engulfed.

322
00:16:07,688 --> 00:16:08,888
You were swallowed up.

323
00:16:08,922 --> 00:16:10,790
And I didn't see you
again for three days.

324
00:16:10,824 --> 00:16:12,892
Well, I didn't see you
again, period, actually.

325
00:16:12,926 --> 00:16:15,995
I waited three days
for you to surface.

326
00:16:16,029 --> 00:16:18,931
I asked around town
in my broken Spanish.

327
00:16:18,965 --> 00:16:21,567
Nobody knew
anything about you.

328
00:16:21,601 --> 00:16:24,203
I hopped a train,
I flew back home.

329
00:16:25,238 --> 00:16:28,307
Fifteen years later,
you knock on my door.

330
00:16:32,713 --> 00:16:35,214
Are you saying that,
uh, I shouldn't?

331
00:16:35,248 --> 00:16:37,049
No. I'm not saying that.

332
00:16:37,084 --> 00:16:39,752
I'm saying that
15 years go by

333
00:16:39,786 --> 00:16:44,190
and no phone call,
no letter, no e-mail.

334
00:16:44,224 --> 00:16:47,526
Life has a funny way
of turning things around, man.

335
00:16:47,561 --> 00:16:49,095
You became a billionaire.

336
00:16:49,129 --> 00:16:51,297
What do I do -
calling a billionaire, man?

337
00:16:51,331 --> 00:16:53,399
How's your mom?

338
00:16:56,803 --> 00:17:00,106
She died about three years
ago of pancreatic cancer.

339
00:17:01,241 --> 00:17:03,776
But thank you for asking.

340
00:17:03,810 --> 00:17:05,511
I'm sorry.

341
00:17:06,380 --> 00:17:08,647
I really cared
for your mom a lot.

342
00:17:08,682 --> 00:17:11,183
She cared for you, too.

343
00:17:11,218 --> 00:17:13,853
In fact, I think she cared for
you more than she did for me.

344
00:17:13,887 --> 00:17:15,888
- No.
- Yeah.

345
00:17:15,922 --> 00:17:17,356
I'm sorry about that.

346
00:17:17,391 --> 00:17:18,624
No, she did.

347
00:17:18,658 --> 00:17:20,826
She always said,
why can't you be more like...

348
00:17:20,861 --> 00:17:22,261
This guy.

349
00:17:22,295 --> 00:17:23,596
You know what she thought?

350
00:17:23,630 --> 00:17:25,765
She thought that the only reason
I was interested in making money

351
00:17:25,799 --> 00:17:28,601
was so that I would be able
to rip off the suit and tie

352
00:17:28,635 --> 00:17:30,436
and never have
to wear it again.

353
00:17:30,470 --> 00:17:32,038
Well, you did that.

354
00:17:32,072 --> 00:17:33,606
That's exactly
what's happened - it's true.

355
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:35,975
I never have to
wear a suit and tie.

356
00:17:38,412 --> 00:17:39,779
Anyhow...

357
00:17:39,813 --> 00:17:41,747
It's good.

358
00:17:41,782 --> 00:17:44,150
I'm-- I'm having a problem.

359
00:17:44,184 --> 00:17:46,218
Uh-huh?

360
00:17:46,253 --> 00:17:49,121
They were supposed to give
me money - an investment bank.

361
00:17:49,156 --> 00:17:51,257
Sylk and Sylk.
You know them.

362
00:17:51,291 --> 00:17:52,725
- Are you married?
- Yeah.

363
00:17:52,759 --> 00:17:54,927
- What's her name?
- Sherry.

364
00:17:54,961 --> 00:17:56,896
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

365
00:17:57,330 --> 00:17:59,198
Okay, you're gonna pitch me.
Go ahead, pitch me.

366
00:17:59,232 --> 00:18:01,100
You're in a bit of a bind...

367
00:18:01,134 --> 00:18:03,602
They were supposed to
give me 12 million dollars,

368
00:18:03,637 --> 00:18:05,071
you know, for the company.

369
00:18:05,105 --> 00:18:06,305
I've put 2 million dollars
out of the manufacturing

370
00:18:06,340 --> 00:18:07,440
line of credit--

371
00:18:07,474 --> 00:18:09,175
- Kids?
- Yeah, a girl.

372
00:18:09,209 --> 00:18:10,810
- What's her name?
- Charley.

373
00:18:10,844 --> 00:18:12,044
Charley.
Pretty name.

374
00:18:12,079 --> 00:18:13,579
Thank you.

375
00:18:15,782 --> 00:18:18,451
Okay, so 2 million
line of credit,

376
00:18:18,485 --> 00:18:20,720
it's been yanked,
and now you're up against it.

377
00:18:20,754 --> 00:18:22,321
What do you need?

378
00:18:22,356 --> 00:18:24,223
- I need 12 million.
- All right.

379
00:18:27,294 --> 00:18:30,563
All right, 12 million.
You got 12 million.

380
00:18:30,597 --> 00:18:32,665
Is that the last
I'm gonna see of you?

381
00:18:35,369 --> 00:18:37,203
Is that the last
I'm gonna see of you?

382
00:18:37,237 --> 00:18:38,437
Because, you know what?

383
00:18:38,472 --> 00:18:40,606
I'm not gonna have
a damn thing to do with this.

384
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:41,607
I'm gonna call my lawyer.

385
00:18:41,641 --> 00:18:43,009
My lawyer's gonna
call his lawyer.

386
00:18:43,043 --> 00:18:44,944
His lawyer's gonna
call a subsidiary lawyer.

387
00:18:44,978 --> 00:18:46,846
Eventually it's gonna
trickle down to somebody.

388
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:49,648
And it'll get dealt with.
And I hope you do very well.

389
00:18:49,683 --> 00:18:51,684
Well, if I do well,
you'll do well--

390
00:18:51,718 --> 00:18:53,853
No, it doesn't make a
goddamn bit of difference.

391
00:18:53,887 --> 00:18:56,022
You could make
100 million dollars on this.

392
00:18:56,056 --> 00:18:58,124
It isn't gonna make a goddamn
bit of difference to me.

393
00:18:58,158 --> 00:18:59,258
Do you know what?

394
00:18:59,292 --> 00:19:01,060
If I took every penny
I had and I started

395
00:19:01,094 --> 00:19:03,729
throwing it around, I could
live to be 1,000 years old,

396
00:19:03,764 --> 00:19:05,197
and I wouldn't
make a dent.

397
00:19:05,232 --> 00:19:07,800
So, it doesn't make a
goddamn bit of difference.

398
00:19:07,834 --> 00:19:11,370
So...I'm gonna give you
12 million dollars.

399
00:19:11,405 --> 00:19:12,972
Am I gonna
see you again?

400
00:19:13,006 --> 00:19:14,840
Of course
you're gonna see me.

401
00:19:14,875 --> 00:19:16,776
You're embarrassing me.

402
00:19:16,810 --> 00:19:19,345
- That your phone?
- Yeah.

403
00:19:19,379 --> 00:19:20,880
I have to take it.

404
00:19:21,982 --> 00:19:24,350
- Hello.
<i>- Hey.</i>

405
00:19:24,384 --> 00:19:25,818
Hi, baby.

406
00:19:25,852 --> 00:19:27,453
<i>I know you're working</i>
<i>real hard right now,</i>

407
00:19:27,487 --> 00:19:28,688
<i>but I really need you.</i>

408
00:19:28,722 --> 00:19:29,889
Baby.

409
00:19:29,923 --> 00:19:32,058
<i>Yeah, I really need</i>
<i>to see you.</i>

410
00:19:32,092 --> 00:19:33,959
Okay, I'll see you
in a little while.

411
00:19:33,994 --> 00:19:36,228
<i>- All right.</i>
<i>- Bye.</i>

412
00:19:36,263 --> 00:19:37,563
She okay?

413
00:19:37,597 --> 00:19:40,766
She's depressed.
Her mom passed away a year ago.

414
00:19:40,801 --> 00:19:43,135
Why don't you bring her over?
I'd love to meet her.

415
00:19:43,170 --> 00:19:44,637
- Charley, too.
- Really?

416
00:19:44,671 --> 00:19:45,871
Have 'em come over.

417
00:19:45,906 --> 00:19:47,139
We'll get the crap
off the table.

418
00:19:47,174 --> 00:19:48,341
We'll have some
pizza and beer.

419
00:19:48,375 --> 00:19:49,408
I'd love to meet 'em.

420
00:19:49,443 --> 00:19:51,410
- I'd love to do that.
- Good. Call 'em.

421
00:19:51,945 --> 00:19:53,846
I need to call
somebody else before.

422
00:19:55,382 --> 00:19:57,583
People at the office
are dropping out.

423
00:19:59,753 --> 00:20:02,121
They thought the money
was coming in last week...

424
00:20:02,155 --> 00:20:05,358
and...they're looking
for jobs right now.

425
00:20:05,392 --> 00:20:06,592
So, fine.
Call 'em.

426
00:20:06,626 --> 00:20:07,693
Tell 'em.

427
00:20:07,728 --> 00:20:09,495
We got the money.
Back to work.

428
00:20:09,529 --> 00:20:10,863
I think they're
going to need more

429
00:20:10,897 --> 00:20:12,131
than me telling them.

430
00:20:12,165 --> 00:20:14,633
I think they're going to
need to possibly meet you.

431
00:20:15,902 --> 00:20:17,803
And immediately after that
I'll call my wife

432
00:20:17,838 --> 00:20:19,238
and I'll bring Charley over.

433
00:20:19,272 --> 00:20:20,506
Yeah, okay.

434
00:20:20,540 --> 00:20:22,441
All right, so I have
to meet your staff?

435
00:20:22,476 --> 00:20:24,076
Please.
It would help me.

436
00:20:24,111 --> 00:20:25,845
All right, all right.

437
00:20:29,349 --> 00:20:32,318
I don't like
to go out, so...

438
00:20:32,352 --> 00:20:34,487
why don't you
have them come over?

439
00:20:36,323 --> 00:20:37,490
Thank you.

440
00:20:37,524 --> 00:20:38,758
How many we talkin'?

441
00:20:38,792 --> 00:20:40,359
About eight.
Ten.

442
00:20:40,394 --> 00:20:41,727
Twelve.

443
00:20:41,762 --> 00:20:43,529
Eight, ten, twelve?

444
00:20:44,097 --> 00:20:45,598
Brian...

445
00:20:45,632 --> 00:20:47,633
Beginning to sound
a lot like Granada.

446
00:20:56,510 --> 00:20:57,576
Okay, guys.

447
00:20:57,611 --> 00:20:59,311
Guys, guys, guys.

448
00:20:59,346 --> 00:21:02,281
I know we're having
a good time here...

449
00:21:02,315 --> 00:21:04,950
but I wanna thank Brad,

450
00:21:04,985 --> 00:21:08,154
who stepped in officially
into the business,

451
00:21:08,188 --> 00:21:12,491
and who's now basically
our partner, my partner.

452
00:21:12,526 --> 00:21:14,727
And, um, and I wanna
thank all of you

453
00:21:14,761 --> 00:21:16,696
for doing the work
you're doing,

454
00:21:16,730 --> 00:21:18,698
which I think
is fantastic.

455
00:21:18,732 --> 00:21:20,199
We've gone through
the difficulties,

456
00:21:20,233 --> 00:21:22,134
and we're okay now.

457
00:21:22,169 --> 00:21:25,171
Uh, the business is doing great
and we should all be fine.

458
00:21:25,205 --> 00:21:26,906
We all have to wake up
early in the morning

459
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:28,974
and so does Brad.

460
00:21:29,009 --> 00:21:30,409
So I'm gonna
ask you, please -

461
00:21:30,444 --> 00:21:32,044
you know, I see
the plates are empty.

462
00:21:32,079 --> 00:21:34,146
We all ate.

463
00:21:34,181 --> 00:21:35,981
It's, uh,
it's time to go, right?

464
00:21:36,016 --> 00:21:38,084
Thank you so much.

465
00:21:38,952 --> 00:21:40,619
Thanks, Brad.

466
00:21:40,654 --> 00:21:41,887
Thank you, Brad.

467
00:21:41,922 --> 00:21:43,556
Cheers, Brad.

468
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:44,990
Cheers.

469
00:21:46,226 --> 00:21:48,427
It's Brad, please.

470
00:21:49,129 --> 00:21:50,996
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

471
00:22:30,237 --> 00:22:33,773
Brad, do you mind if
I finish my glass of wine?

472
00:22:37,844 --> 00:22:39,845
What are you
doing down there?

473
00:22:39,880 --> 00:22:42,281
I'm cleaning, baby.

474
00:22:42,315 --> 00:22:43,649
I promised I'd
clean the eyesore.

475
00:22:43,684 --> 00:22:44,950
I'm cleaning the eyesore.

476
00:22:44,985 --> 00:22:46,852
Do you know how much
I love you right now?

477
00:22:46,887 --> 00:22:49,255
You don't know how
much I love you, my love.

478
00:22:49,289 --> 00:22:51,657
In two weeks we're gonna
be sitting in that jacuzzi.

479
00:22:51,692 --> 00:22:53,192
In two weeks?

480
00:22:53,226 --> 00:22:54,660
Three weeks.

481
00:22:55,729 --> 00:22:57,196
Come on, Biggie-Boy.

482
00:23:00,734 --> 00:23:02,201
I'm getting dizzy.

483
00:23:02,235 --> 00:23:03,969
You're not dizzy, baby?

484
00:23:05,105 --> 00:23:06,505
You have one of those?

485
00:23:06,540 --> 00:23:08,908
What else do you want?
You want one of those?

486
00:23:08,942 --> 00:23:10,743
Ooooh, feel it.

487
00:23:10,777 --> 00:23:12,745
- That's what you want?
- Yeah.

488
00:23:12,779 --> 00:23:14,480
You want this?
Okay, we take this.

489
00:23:14,514 --> 00:23:16,182
- And this, too.
- Okay.

490
00:23:18,251 --> 00:23:20,019
You want this one?

491
00:23:20,053 --> 00:23:21,454
Okay, we take this.

492
00:23:21,955 --> 00:23:23,823
Okay, all of that, please.

493
00:23:47,080 --> 00:23:49,348
I had such a beautiful day.

494
00:23:49,383 --> 00:23:52,084
It's good for you, you know?

495
00:23:52,119 --> 00:23:54,520
And it's good for us.

496
00:23:54,554 --> 00:23:56,589
I have to slow down, baby.

497
00:23:57,624 --> 00:23:59,158
Don't--
don't answer the phone.

498
00:23:59,192 --> 00:24:00,526
Don't answer the phone.

499
00:24:00,560 --> 00:24:02,061
Don't.

500
00:24:04,431 --> 00:24:05,498
Hello.

501
00:24:05,532 --> 00:24:07,299
<i>Amer, hello.</i>

502
00:24:07,334 --> 00:24:08,734
Yes.

503
00:24:08,769 --> 00:24:10,603
Pleasant evening at home
with your family, I hope.

504
00:24:10,637 --> 00:24:11,570
<i>Yes.</i>

505
00:24:11,605 --> 00:24:13,239
Good.

506
00:24:13,273 --> 00:24:15,341
And did you have a nice
celebratory day today?

507
00:24:15,375 --> 00:24:17,643
<i>Wonderful day, yes.</i>
<i>And you?</i>

508
00:24:17,678 --> 00:24:21,280
I'm wondering if that
vivacious woman on your staff

509
00:24:21,314 --> 00:24:24,717
called today to report
back to you.

510
00:24:24,751 --> 00:24:27,219
She had a fun
party last night.

511
00:24:27,254 --> 00:24:30,890
Woke up on my
sofa this morning.

512
00:24:30,924 --> 00:24:32,858
Puked in a vase...

513
00:24:32,893 --> 00:24:34,193
which is neither
here nor there.

514
00:24:34,227 --> 00:24:35,661
I don't wanna
get her in trouble.

515
00:24:35,696 --> 00:24:37,129
I'm calling because, Amer,

516
00:24:37,164 --> 00:24:39,598
you promised me
pizza and beer.

517
00:24:39,633 --> 00:24:41,934
I promised you
12 million dollars.

518
00:24:41,968 --> 00:24:45,104
And I didn't get
pizza and beer,

519
00:24:45,138 --> 00:24:48,474
so you're not gonna
get 12 million dollars.

520
00:24:48,508 --> 00:24:50,076
I'm sorry.

521
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:52,078
If you feel like calling
down the road -

522
00:24:52,112 --> 00:24:55,881
for pizza and beer -
feel free.

523
00:25:04,358 --> 00:25:05,991
What happened?

524
00:25:18,505 --> 00:25:20,272
- You okay?
- Yeah.

525
00:26:20,967 --> 00:26:23,235
What are you
doing out here?

526
00:26:28,542 --> 00:26:30,509
You know what time it is?

527
00:26:43,256 --> 00:26:44,657
I'm sorry.

528
00:26:46,393 --> 00:26:48,461
I think you should
come to bed now.

529
00:26:49,429 --> 00:26:51,464
<i>I think you couldn't</i>
<i>have picked a worse timing.</i>

530
00:26:51,498 --> 00:26:54,433
<i>The board of</i>
<i>director is frantic.</i>

531
00:26:54,468 --> 00:26:57,937
<i>They do not want me to invest</i>
<i>anymore in any brand activity.</i>

532
00:26:57,971 --> 00:27:01,173
They want me to stick to
our core competency,

533
00:27:01,208 --> 00:27:03,676
which, as you know,
is manufacturing.

534
00:27:03,710 --> 00:27:07,213
But I thank you for being so
honest and so open about it.

535
00:27:07,247 --> 00:27:09,715
There is nothing
I can do at this point.

536
00:27:09,750 --> 00:27:11,450
If you cannot put your
financing together

537
00:27:11,485 --> 00:27:13,586
in the next
24 to 48 hours,

538
00:27:13,620 --> 00:27:16,222
I'm afraid to tell you,
we have to stop production.

539
00:27:16,923 --> 00:27:18,657
I wanna preserve
my friendship with you.

540
00:27:18,692 --> 00:27:20,960
I love you.
My family loves you.

541
00:27:20,994 --> 00:27:22,628
It's not about money.

542
00:27:22,662 --> 00:27:25,831
I just don't wanna lose your
friendship over this situation.

543
00:27:25,866 --> 00:27:26,932
Please...

544
00:27:27,801 --> 00:27:30,836
I'm like a...like a dog
on a short leash.

545
00:27:30,871 --> 00:27:32,471
It's a little
embarrassing for me.

546
00:27:32,506 --> 00:27:34,674
I live off the charity.

547
00:27:35,175 --> 00:27:36,575
I repeat the terms.

548
00:27:36,610 --> 00:27:38,177
Half in six months.

549
00:27:38,211 --> 00:27:40,279
Half in twelve month.

550
00:27:40,313 --> 00:27:43,049
Half in eighteen month.

551
00:27:43,083 --> 00:27:45,084
Half in twenty-four month...

552
00:27:45,719 --> 00:27:47,987
<i>Look, you have</i>
<i>prime real estate.</i>

553
00:27:48,021 --> 00:27:50,556
<i>You gotta pay</i>
<i>your rent on time...</i>

554
00:27:53,927 --> 00:27:55,928
I'm sorry.
I'm so tired...

555
00:27:55,962 --> 00:27:57,697
for no reason.

556
00:27:57,731 --> 00:28:00,399
I mean, I'm just
laying in there.

557
00:28:02,336 --> 00:28:04,470
It's weird that
Charley's four, you know?

558
00:28:04,504 --> 00:28:07,206
She's in pre-school
almost all day now.

559
00:28:07,240 --> 00:28:09,842
And Amer's working and...

560
00:28:09,876 --> 00:28:11,877
the house is just empty.

561
00:28:11,912 --> 00:28:13,846
It's so quiet.

562
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:16,916
That's why I have the TV
on the whole time.

563
00:28:16,950 --> 00:28:19,585
Sweetie, sweetie.

564
00:28:21,221 --> 00:28:23,723
- I'm so sorry.
- No, no.

565
00:28:23,757 --> 00:28:25,758
I know
you're lonely, but--

566
00:28:25,792 --> 00:28:29,028
I was watching this
videotape of mom.

567
00:28:29,062 --> 00:28:31,497
She was just being mom
and she was really funny,

568
00:28:31,531 --> 00:28:34,000
and I was kind of
annoyed with her.

569
00:28:34,034 --> 00:28:37,970
You know,
and I felt like I'd let...

570
00:28:38,005 --> 00:28:40,539
maybe I let too
much time go by

571
00:28:40,574 --> 00:28:43,075
that I should've spent
with her, you know?

572
00:28:43,110 --> 00:28:46,212
I mean, I know
that's grief and...

573
00:28:46,246 --> 00:28:51,851
But, you know...
I love Amer so much.

574
00:28:51,885 --> 00:28:56,856
So I realize that
sometimes I'm more lonely

575
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:01,527
when he's here
than when he's not here.

576
00:29:01,561 --> 00:29:05,398
When he's in
this house, he's not...

577
00:29:05,432 --> 00:29:07,299
he's not with me.

578
00:29:07,334 --> 00:29:09,702
And I'm so much
a part of that man,

579
00:29:09,736 --> 00:29:14,173
he's so much
a part of my soul that...

580
00:29:14,207 --> 00:29:19,545
when he's...
absent from me...it's...

581
00:29:19,579 --> 00:29:24,083
it's like a betrayal
and I'm mad as hell.

582
00:29:24,618 --> 00:29:26,285
This is it.
This is life.

583
00:29:26,319 --> 00:29:28,320
- This is what you chose.
- I know it's what I chose.

584
00:29:28,355 --> 00:29:30,489
Maybe he was just
always like this--

585
00:29:30,524 --> 00:29:31,824
Well, I--

586
00:29:31,858 --> 00:29:34,226
Now I'm more
selfish or something.

587
00:29:34,261 --> 00:29:35,661
You're not selfish.
Don't say that.

588
00:29:35,696 --> 00:29:37,930
I mean, the thing is,
it's not selfish to want

589
00:29:37,964 --> 00:29:40,666
the man that you love
to be present with you.

590
00:29:40,701 --> 00:29:44,470
Luke was never present -
truly present - with me.

591
00:29:44,504 --> 00:29:46,806
Was it selfish
that I said I need love?

592
00:29:46,840 --> 00:29:49,542
How did you know that...

593
00:29:49,576 --> 00:29:53,946
not to go on for another,
you know, three, four years?

594
00:29:53,980 --> 00:29:57,783
Because I was dying.
Are you dying?

595
00:31:00,013 --> 00:31:02,682
(Amer) The bank only
gave me 30 days.

596
00:31:03,383 --> 00:31:06,385
I've been here an
hour and a half, man.

597
00:31:09,389 --> 00:31:11,891
No, I was supposed to
meet him at the park.

598
00:31:12,459 --> 00:31:15,227
Okay...
I bring the paperwork.

599
00:31:31,545 --> 00:31:32,912
It's hot.

600
00:31:36,383 --> 00:31:39,285
Honey, that's not playing
with your daughter.

601
00:31:39,319 --> 00:31:42,555
That's not paying
attention to her.

602
00:31:43,990 --> 00:31:46,058
She knows that.

603
00:31:47,527 --> 00:31:49,462
It's affecting her
and it's affecting

604
00:31:49,496 --> 00:31:53,332
our marriage...
our home.

605
00:31:55,635 --> 00:31:58,237
She's not even asking
where you are anymore,

606
00:31:58,271 --> 00:32:01,474
'cuz Daddy's
always at work.

607
00:32:03,877 --> 00:32:06,612
And...

608
00:32:06,646 --> 00:32:10,883
so maybe that's
where you should be.

609
00:32:10,917 --> 00:32:14,520
I think you should...

610
00:32:14,554 --> 00:32:18,491
I think you should go
stay at the office

611
00:32:18,525 --> 00:32:21,460
for just a little while...

612
00:32:21,495 --> 00:32:23,796
because I need
some time.

613
00:32:44,885 --> 00:32:47,386
Something has
to change, my love.

614
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:55,394
I'm sorry.

615
00:33:14,448 --> 00:33:15,481
What is it, Brian?

616
00:33:15,515 --> 00:33:17,016
You change the
fucking deal on me?

617
00:33:17,050 --> 00:33:18,351
We need--

618
00:33:18,385 --> 00:33:19,919
We need ten grand, man.

619
00:33:19,953 --> 00:33:22,421
$7500 - all in!
That was the fucking deal.

620
00:33:22,456 --> 00:33:23,823
A couple of things came up.

621
00:33:23,857 --> 00:33:26,292
We could really
use the extra 2500.

622
00:33:26,326 --> 00:33:27,493
I know you know
what I'm talking about.

623
00:33:27,527 --> 00:33:29,195
That is not
the fucking deal, asshole!

624
00:33:29,229 --> 00:33:30,930
I know you know what
I'm talking about.

625
00:33:30,964 --> 00:33:32,331
Shut the fuck up!

626
00:33:32,366 --> 00:33:34,266
You're a fucking loser.
Wipe out the fucking blow, man!

627
00:33:34,301 --> 00:33:36,168
Go back home!
Don't waste my fucking time!

628
00:33:37,037 --> 00:33:38,571
Preferred equity.
They'll get a primary

629
00:33:38,605 --> 00:33:40,206
return on their investment.

630
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,208
The first 20% out
will get their money back--

631
00:33:42,242 --> 00:33:44,377
We have an unbelievable space
on Sunset at the moment--

632
00:33:44,411 --> 00:33:47,513
We may have to push the
campaign by a couple of weeks.

633
00:34:15,976 --> 00:34:17,376
I think you should go.

634
00:34:23,483 --> 00:34:26,185
I've come here because there's
something I need to tell you.

635
00:34:26,219 --> 00:34:27,987
I was always
scared to tell you,

636
00:34:28,021 --> 00:34:31,157
but it's part of my life
and you must know.

637
00:34:32,793 --> 00:34:35,094
When I first
came to America,

638
00:34:35,128 --> 00:34:37,863
I drove back to
Los Angeles one day.

639
00:34:37,898 --> 00:34:42,134
And a man
crossed the street...

640
00:34:42,169 --> 00:34:44,437
out of nowhere.
And I hit him.

641
00:34:46,306 --> 00:34:49,975
Sometimes I wonder if the man
wanted to simply kill himself.

642
00:34:50,010 --> 00:34:51,610
All I know
is that I hit him

643
00:34:51,645 --> 00:34:54,814
and that he got
hurt very bad.

644
00:34:56,650 --> 00:34:58,417
Did he survive?

645
00:34:59,486 --> 00:35:02,021
He's alive, baby.
He's in a wheelchair.

646
00:35:02,055 --> 00:35:04,123
Oh, my God.

647
00:35:04,558 --> 00:35:07,393
I parked the car
and I came down running.

648
00:35:07,427 --> 00:35:10,062
And there was
a car that stopped -

649
00:35:10,097 --> 00:35:11,864
and they
took him away.

650
00:35:11,898 --> 00:35:14,133
I saw them take him away.

651
00:35:15,102 --> 00:35:17,169
This thing eats me up, my love.

652
00:35:17,204 --> 00:35:20,773
I know who he is,
where he lives.

653
00:35:20,807 --> 00:35:23,242
And you could never...

654
00:35:23,276 --> 00:35:25,544
you could
never tell me?

655
00:35:25,579 --> 00:35:28,247
For me to give you this
information on myself

656
00:35:28,281 --> 00:35:32,952
is taking a chance that
you'll stop loving me.

657
00:35:32,986 --> 00:35:35,154
It makes no sense, my love.

658
00:35:35,188 --> 00:35:37,223
He leaped out of nowhere.

659
00:35:37,257 --> 00:35:40,926
I've been living with
this 15 years now.

660
00:35:40,961 --> 00:35:44,063
I have to
face this man, baby.

661
00:35:44,097 --> 00:35:47,700
I think his anger
is holding me back.

662
00:35:49,803 --> 00:35:52,705
I don't know if you
can blame someone else

663
00:35:52,739 --> 00:35:58,678
for what's going on,
or blame their anger.

664
00:35:58,712 --> 00:36:03,949
I don't believe someone can
curse you with their anger.

665
00:36:03,984 --> 00:36:07,086
But I know you feel
you have to go.

666
00:36:46,126 --> 00:36:47,360
Phillip Blackman lives here?

667
00:36:47,394 --> 00:36:48,661
Yeah.

668
00:36:48,695 --> 00:36:49,995
At this time of night
you should know

669
00:36:50,030 --> 00:36:52,331
that he's at Big Jim's,
down the street.

670
00:36:55,302 --> 00:36:59,038
# So you weather
the sea change #

671
00:36:59,072 --> 00:37:06,379
# as the mountains
are melting under you #

672
00:37:06,413 --> 00:37:10,850
# Watch the ocean,
how she rises, #

673
00:37:10,884 --> 00:37:15,855
# turning everything blue #

674
00:37:15,889 --> 00:37:19,759
# Blue as the sky #

675
00:37:19,793 --> 00:37:25,197
# above these
fading satellites #

676
00:37:25,232 --> 00:37:33,372
# Slipping away,
back to the stars #

677
00:37:33,407 --> 00:37:37,343
# To be burned,
burned by the sun #

678
00:37:37,377 --> 00:37:41,981
# Into the void
of where we've begun #

679
00:37:42,015 --> 00:37:46,652
# Oh, I am burned,
burned by the sun #

680
00:37:46,687 --> 00:37:52,024
# Into the void
of where we've begun #

681
00:37:52,059 --> 00:37:56,028
# Love...
Love is the answer #

682
00:37:56,063 --> 00:37:58,130
# How many times #

683
00:37:58,165 --> 00:38:02,535
# How many prophets
have to tell you #

684
00:38:02,569 --> 00:38:04,970
# It's astounding #

685
00:38:05,005 --> 00:38:07,506
# 'cuz you live here #

686
00:38:07,541 --> 00:38:13,112
# Don't you live here, too?#

687
00:38:13,146 --> 00:38:15,648
# And blue is the sky #

688
00:38:15,682 --> 00:38:21,187
# above these
fading satellites #

689
00:38:21,221 --> 00:38:26,092
# Making our way #

690
00:38:26,126 --> 00:38:31,397
# back to the stars #

691
00:38:31,431 --> 00:38:35,601
# To be burned,
burned by the sun #

692
00:38:35,635 --> 00:38:40,072
# Into the void
of where we've begun #

693
00:38:40,107 --> 00:38:42,508
# Oh, I am burned #

694
00:38:42,542 --> 00:38:44,777
# by the sun #

695
00:38:44,811 --> 00:38:49,148
# Into the void
of where we've begun #

696
00:38:49,182 --> 00:38:52,184
# Where we've begun...#

697
00:39:02,529 --> 00:39:05,197
# Where we've begun #

698
00:39:08,535 --> 00:39:10,803
I don't know
how this song ends.

699
00:39:10,837 --> 00:39:13,606
I never figured that out
before I got up here.

700
00:39:16,076 --> 00:39:17,777
<i>[applause]</i>

701
00:39:17,811 --> 00:39:19,745
Well, now...

702
00:39:27,754 --> 00:39:30,456
Oh, come on.
You know the drill.

703
00:39:30,490 --> 00:39:32,425
You're always here.

704
00:39:43,337 --> 00:39:45,204
You wanna buy me a beer?

705
00:39:45,238 --> 00:39:46,772
Sure.

706
00:39:49,576 --> 00:39:51,310
Bar's that way.

707
00:40:02,856 --> 00:40:05,191
Can I have a beer, please?
And a glass of water.

708
00:40:07,094 --> 00:40:08,794
- You have a nice voice.
- Thanks.

709
00:40:16,670 --> 00:40:17,670
How much?

710
00:40:17,704 --> 00:40:19,772
Twenty.

711
00:40:20,474 --> 00:40:21,807
There's a cover.

712
00:40:25,245 --> 00:40:27,246
You should tip her as well.

713
00:40:28,882 --> 00:40:30,683
Wanna come with us?

714
00:40:34,688 --> 00:40:36,422
- You okay?
- Yes.

715
00:40:37,557 --> 00:40:39,759
Come with us.
Come, let's go.

716
00:40:40,427 --> 00:40:42,094
Please.

717
00:41:05,786 --> 00:41:07,420
You okay, honey?

718
00:41:07,454 --> 00:41:09,055
Yeah.

719
00:41:44,324 --> 00:41:45,958
You wanna
take your shoes off?

720
00:41:45,992 --> 00:41:47,560
I won't be long.

721
00:41:47,594 --> 00:41:50,463
Just help yourself to
anything in the refrigerator.

722
00:42:12,052 --> 00:42:13,052
You were great tonight.

723
00:42:13,086 --> 00:42:15,054
Oh, thank you.

724
00:42:15,088 --> 00:42:17,023
- Amazing.
- It was fun.

725
00:42:17,057 --> 00:42:18,824
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

726
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:21,293
I love it.

727
00:42:21,328 --> 00:42:23,996
I love those moments.

728
00:42:24,031 --> 00:42:26,198
I know they're not
listening too much--

729
00:42:26,233 --> 00:42:27,500
Hold on.
You got it?

730
00:42:27,534 --> 00:42:29,468
There you go.

731
00:42:29,503 --> 00:42:30,936
Ready?

732
00:42:34,374 --> 00:42:37,209
My beautiful falling tree.

733
00:42:38,278 --> 00:42:39,945
- You ready?
- Yeah.

734
00:42:39,980 --> 00:42:41,180
Okay, hold on.

735
00:42:41,214 --> 00:42:42,481
Do you realize this
is what I'm gonna

736
00:42:42,516 --> 00:42:43,616
talk about tomorrow.

737
00:42:43,650 --> 00:42:45,051
- What?
- My lecture.

738
00:42:45,085 --> 00:42:47,420
I'm gonna deal
with manifestation--

739
00:42:48,555 --> 00:42:49,555
Which one?

740
00:42:49,589 --> 00:42:50,923
Uh, this one is good.

741
00:42:50,957 --> 00:42:52,291
I'm gonna deal
with manifestation

742
00:42:52,325 --> 00:42:54,060
and how you can
create something,

743
00:42:54,094 --> 00:42:57,663
how you can make something
happen from your thoughts...

744
00:42:57,698 --> 00:42:59,765
from your feelings.

745
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:02,468
I got this, uh, one piece.

746
00:43:02,502 --> 00:43:06,205
"The words of
the Lord of the World,

747
00:43:06,239 --> 00:43:09,842
which he spoke
after coming into being.

748
00:43:09,876 --> 00:43:11,610
'I am he, who came
into being in the form

749
00:43:11,645 --> 00:43:14,480
of the infinite power
of manifestation.'"

750
00:43:15,248 --> 00:43:16,982
It's pretty...
it's pretty hard,

751
00:43:17,017 --> 00:43:18,951
because outside
things happen.

752
00:43:18,985 --> 00:43:21,454
Outside influences have
a direct impact on your life--

753
00:43:21,488 --> 00:43:23,122
But you still
create those things.

754
00:43:23,156 --> 00:43:25,358
You don't have
control over...

755
00:43:25,392 --> 00:43:28,194
a mother - a mother
walking into a room

756
00:43:28,228 --> 00:43:32,798
and finding her baby's died
of sudden infant death--

757
00:43:32,833 --> 00:43:34,834
No, because you're thinking,
because you have a thought.

758
00:43:34,868 --> 00:43:36,268
Like you're saying,
I don't want -

759
00:43:36,303 --> 00:43:37,937
I don't want a child
to die or anything.

760
00:43:37,971 --> 00:43:40,239
Underneath it all,
in your subconscious--

761
00:43:40,273 --> 00:43:42,942
It's just like, if you're
in a relationship

762
00:43:42,976 --> 00:43:44,677
and it's a really
bad relationship.

763
00:43:44,711 --> 00:43:46,379
You know, people
even allow themselves

764
00:43:46,413 --> 00:43:47,747
to get beaten in relationships.

765
00:43:47,781 --> 00:43:49,448
So they're being beaten
in this relationship,

766
00:43:49,483 --> 00:43:50,583
and they say to themselves, -

767
00:43:50,617 --> 00:43:53,152
I wanna leave.

768
00:43:53,186 --> 00:43:55,121
But they don't,
because underneath,

769
00:43:55,155 --> 00:43:57,089
the core thing,
the core issue -

770
00:43:57,124 --> 00:43:59,825
it's not gone.
It's still there.

771
00:43:59,860 --> 00:44:01,994
And that's the same
thing with your subconscious.

772
00:44:02,029 --> 00:44:04,597
Your subconscious
is like...

773
00:44:05,198 --> 00:44:09,869
I think it's made me a better
person in different ways.

774
00:44:09,903 --> 00:44:12,004
I know maybe...

775
00:44:12,039 --> 00:44:15,608
maybe not in every way
that you need, you know?

776
00:44:15,642 --> 00:44:16,876
Yeah.

777
00:44:16,910 --> 00:44:18,878
But I do want...

778
00:44:20,447 --> 00:44:22,348
- I, uh--
- Yeah.

779
00:44:24,718 --> 00:44:26,719
I should probably go.

780
00:44:26,753 --> 00:44:30,022
- Yeah.
- All right?

781
00:44:30,057 --> 00:44:31,390
You gonna go?

782
00:44:31,425 --> 00:44:32,892
- Yeah.
- Okay.

783
00:44:32,926 --> 00:44:34,760
I mean, this guy's been
waiting for a long time.

784
00:44:34,795 --> 00:44:36,095
I hope he's still there.

785
00:44:36,129 --> 00:44:37,797
Of course, he's there.
I mean, I wouldn't--

786
00:44:37,831 --> 00:44:40,399
He'd be crazy
not to be there.

787
00:44:40,934 --> 00:44:43,235
Try to have
a good time, okay?

788
00:44:43,270 --> 00:44:45,404
Yeah.

789
00:44:45,439 --> 00:44:48,374
I want you to be happy.

790
00:44:48,408 --> 00:44:50,276
I am happy.

791
00:44:53,547 --> 00:44:54,947
You okay?

792
00:44:54,981 --> 00:44:56,248
You need me
to get you anything?

793
00:44:56,283 --> 00:44:57,483
No.

794
00:44:57,517 --> 00:45:00,353
I'm gonna finish
the work I'm doing.

795
00:45:00,387 --> 00:45:02,221
I'll do your other leg
when I come back.

796
00:45:02,255 --> 00:45:04,757
And, well...

797
00:45:04,791 --> 00:45:06,225
get you out
of this suit.

798
00:45:06,259 --> 00:45:07,893
Are you okay?
You're not too hot?

799
00:45:07,928 --> 00:45:09,061
Cold?

800
00:45:09,096 --> 00:45:10,329
- I'm perfect.
- Okay, good.

801
00:45:10,364 --> 00:45:11,931
Don't worry about me.

802
00:45:22,576 --> 00:45:23,609
Sorry.

803
00:45:23,643 --> 00:45:25,578
Is your husband
coming out?

804
00:45:25,612 --> 00:45:28,414
No, no.

805
00:45:28,448 --> 00:45:32,485
He doesn't like to watch.
That's not his thing.

806
00:45:32,519 --> 00:45:36,255
You know, he's uh...
he's reading.

807
00:45:38,525 --> 00:45:39,959
I don't suppose
you have

808
00:45:39,993 --> 00:45:42,561
a paraplegic wife
at home, do you?

809
00:45:42,596 --> 00:45:46,265
That would be a great
coincidence if you did.

810
00:45:52,739 --> 00:45:54,407
Why are you so shy?

811
00:45:55,909 --> 00:45:57,977
What?

812
00:45:58,011 --> 00:46:00,546
Is-is-is your
husband coming out?

813
00:46:00,580 --> 00:46:02,648
No.

814
00:46:02,683 --> 00:46:04,016
- I know I already asked.
- You did.

815
00:46:04,051 --> 00:46:06,118
You asked me
that a couple times.

816
00:46:06,153 --> 00:46:07,820
Why?
You like to be watched?

817
00:46:07,854 --> 00:46:09,488
No, no, no.

818
00:46:10,123 --> 00:46:11,724
He seems like
a nice man.

819
00:46:11,758 --> 00:46:13,225
He's way too nice
to come out here

820
00:46:13,260 --> 00:46:14,860
and watch you
and me have sex.

821
00:46:14,895 --> 00:46:16,662
That's for sure.

822
00:46:18,598 --> 00:46:21,434
You know, you...

823
00:46:21,468 --> 00:46:23,636
I mean,
you don't have to -

824
00:46:23,670 --> 00:46:25,171
You don't have to worry.

825
00:46:25,205 --> 00:46:26,305
I'm an...

826
00:46:26,340 --> 00:46:28,274
I'm an absolute sure thing.

827
00:46:28,308 --> 00:46:32,345
Take very little for me
to just take my clothes off--

828
00:46:32,379 --> 00:46:34,213
Really?

829
00:46:34,247 --> 00:46:37,249
Well, you-you---
You are beautiful.

830
00:46:37,284 --> 00:46:38,451
You are beautiful.

831
00:46:38,485 --> 00:46:40,152
Oh, thank you.

832
00:46:40,187 --> 00:46:41,654
Pretty ankles.

833
00:46:42,589 --> 00:46:44,590
Pretty ankles.

834
00:46:44,624 --> 00:46:46,692
Just noticed.
Pretty ankles.

835
00:46:50,263 --> 00:46:52,131
And there's no way
to have, uh,

836
00:46:52,165 --> 00:46:54,367
a small word with
your husband, maybe?

837
00:46:56,069 --> 00:46:58,471
- No.
- No?

838
00:46:58,972 --> 00:47:00,239
No.

839
00:47:01,575 --> 00:47:03,209
This is weird.

840
00:47:05,679 --> 00:47:08,214
You don't wanna
have sex, do you?

841
00:47:08,248 --> 00:47:10,516
No...not at all.

842
00:47:10,550 --> 00:47:13,152
Okay, um, you should go.

843
00:47:14,721 --> 00:47:16,622
I'm serious.
You should really go.

844
00:47:16,656 --> 00:47:18,491
Get out.

845
00:47:20,627 --> 00:47:22,661
I don't know how
you're gonna get home.

846
00:47:22,696 --> 00:47:24,096
Go!

847
00:47:24,131 --> 00:47:25,431
Get the fuck out of here.
Right now.

848
00:47:25,465 --> 00:47:26,966
Thanks.

849
00:47:39,479 --> 00:47:40,680
Hey.

850
00:47:40,714 --> 00:47:42,081
- Hey.
- Hey, hey.

851
00:47:42,115 --> 00:47:44,083
- I'm, uh--
- What's going on?

852
00:47:44,117 --> 00:47:46,185
I don't know what's
up with that guy.

853
00:47:46,219 --> 00:47:47,987
He, uh...

854
00:47:48,021 --> 00:47:50,156
I don't know.
He wasn't into it.

855
00:47:50,190 --> 00:47:52,258
He was totally weird.

856
00:47:52,292 --> 00:47:53,392
I think he was lonely.

857
00:47:53,427 --> 00:47:54,660
He seemed more
interested in wanting

858
00:47:54,695 --> 00:47:56,362
to talk to you
than me, anyway.

859
00:47:56,396 --> 00:47:57,697
I'm gonna go back.

860
00:47:57,731 --> 00:47:59,765
I'm gonna go
back to the bar.

861
00:47:59,800 --> 00:48:01,100
Okay.

862
00:48:01,134 --> 00:48:02,868
I won't be long.

863
00:48:02,903 --> 00:48:05,204
Let's take your jacket off.
It's hot, huh?

864
00:48:05,238 --> 00:48:06,906
Sure.

865
00:48:16,817 --> 00:48:17,883
You sure you're all right?

866
00:48:17,918 --> 00:48:19,218
Oh, yeah.
I'm fine.

867
00:48:19,252 --> 00:48:21,320
It's just,
you know, it's late.

868
00:48:21,355 --> 00:48:23,856
I gotta get up
early tomorrow.

869
00:48:23,890 --> 00:48:26,459
You know I'm going tomorrow?
I'll be back on Sunday.

870
00:48:26,493 --> 00:48:28,060
Peter's gonna be here,
give you your shower,

871
00:48:28,095 --> 00:48:29,328
breakfast and everything.

872
00:48:29,363 --> 00:48:30,696
Yeah, that's right.

873
00:48:30,731 --> 00:48:32,198
Yeah, yeah?

874
00:48:32,232 --> 00:48:33,733
I left him a list
outside anyway.

875
00:48:33,767 --> 00:48:35,201
It's all cool.

876
00:48:35,235 --> 00:48:36,769
Um, but I'll see you later.

877
00:48:36,803 --> 00:48:38,270
I mean, you'll probably
be asleep--

878
00:48:38,305 --> 00:48:40,039
I mean, you'll be back
in a minute, right?

879
00:48:40,073 --> 00:48:41,507
Yeah, I'll be back in a sec.

880
00:48:41,541 --> 00:48:42,908
- Okay?
- Okay.

881
00:48:42,943 --> 00:48:44,910
- Have fun, okay?
- Yeah, you too.

882
00:48:46,847 --> 00:48:48,014
Bye, honey.

883
00:48:48,048 --> 00:48:49,482
You look great.

884
00:49:17,144 --> 00:49:18,344
Good morning.

885
00:49:18,378 --> 00:49:19,712
Good morning.

886
00:49:19,746 --> 00:49:21,280
How are you today?

887
00:49:21,314 --> 00:49:22,815
Fine, how are you?

888
00:49:22,849 --> 00:49:25,818
I imagined that
you were all here.

889
00:49:25,852 --> 00:49:27,453
And here you are.

890
00:49:27,487 --> 00:49:29,689
Sitting in the same
seats that I'd thought

891
00:49:29,723 --> 00:49:31,457
I'd seen before,
as if,

892
00:49:31,491 --> 00:49:34,126
I were just here
a few moments ago.

893
00:49:34,161 --> 00:49:36,028
That's our subject today.

894
00:49:36,063 --> 00:49:37,630
It's about manifestation.

895
00:49:37,664 --> 00:49:39,932
Do we create our own realities?

896
00:49:39,966 --> 00:49:42,068
Are realities created by us?

897
00:49:42,102 --> 00:49:44,403
Is the universe created
from inside us?

898
00:49:45,238 --> 00:49:46,672
Here...

899
00:49:46,707 --> 00:49:49,342
I have something
to read to you today.

900
00:49:50,444 --> 00:49:52,611
"I am he, who came
into being in the form

901
00:49:52,646 --> 00:49:56,315
of the infinite power
of manifestation.

902
00:49:56,350 --> 00:49:59,385
I became the creator
of what came into being.

903
00:49:59,419 --> 00:50:01,487
And after coming into being,

904
00:50:01,521 --> 00:50:04,090
many were the things
which came into being.

905
00:50:04,124 --> 00:50:06,859
Coming forth from my mouth."

906
00:50:07,294 --> 00:50:09,462
There's a story -
it's a Judaic story -

907
00:50:09,496 --> 00:50:11,163
about how
the universe began.

908
00:50:11,198 --> 00:50:12,965
In the beginning,
there was just light.

909
00:50:13,000 --> 00:50:15,101
Solely light.

910
00:50:15,135 --> 00:50:17,103
And he wanted to give.
He was giving off light.

911
00:50:17,137 --> 00:50:18,270
But there was no darkness.

912
00:50:18,305 --> 00:50:20,039
So, is there light
without darkness?

913
00:50:20,073 --> 00:50:22,074
What this divine thought...

914
00:50:24,745 --> 00:50:26,379
Hello.

915
00:50:26,413 --> 00:50:27,813
Phillip?

916
00:50:31,651 --> 00:50:33,386
I'm gonna help you.

917
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:34,720
Okay.

918
00:50:34,755 --> 00:50:36,489
I'm helping you.
Got it?

919
00:50:36,523 --> 00:50:38,991
It's a balancing thing,
so...yeah.

920
00:50:39,026 --> 00:50:40,926
All right.
There we go.

921
00:50:44,664 --> 00:50:47,133
It was much easier
to get up than yesterday.

922
00:50:47,167 --> 00:50:49,101
I was by myself.
Thanks, really.

923
00:50:49,136 --> 00:50:50,970
I tell myself every day -

924
00:50:51,004 --> 00:50:53,673
I have to live
by what I preach.

925
00:50:53,707 --> 00:50:56,709
And that means
I wanna walk, so I will walk.

926
00:50:56,743 --> 00:50:58,544
And you will walk, Phillip.

927
00:50:58,578 --> 00:51:00,513
I will definitely
walk one day.

928
00:51:00,547 --> 00:51:01,681
You will walk, Phillip.

929
00:51:01,715 --> 00:51:04,550
If you really believe,
you can walk on water.

930
00:51:04,584 --> 00:51:06,285
You just have
to have no doubts.

931
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:08,287
And I guess still
have a few doubts.

932
00:51:08,321 --> 00:51:10,289
Phillip, I was
here last night.

933
00:51:10,323 --> 00:51:13,159
Yeah, it's good
to see you again.

934
00:51:13,193 --> 00:51:16,128
I'm confused as to...
why you're here.

935
00:51:16,163 --> 00:51:18,564
I'd asked your wife
last night if she would

936
00:51:18,598 --> 00:51:20,966
allow me to have a moment
with you last night -

937
00:51:21,001 --> 00:51:22,601
but she wouldn't.

938
00:51:22,636 --> 00:51:25,104
Were you feeling
guilty or something?

939
00:51:25,138 --> 00:51:26,138
No, I just--

940
00:51:26,173 --> 00:51:27,306
Because you shouldn't.

941
00:51:27,341 --> 00:51:29,342
My wife,
she's a beautiful woman,

942
00:51:29,376 --> 00:51:32,478
and, uh, I want her
to be happy.

943
00:51:32,512 --> 00:51:34,747
'Cuz I'm very happy.

944
00:51:34,781 --> 00:51:37,049
Phillip, I didn't come
for your wife.

945
00:51:37,084 --> 00:51:39,018
I'm came to meet with you.

946
00:51:41,788 --> 00:51:46,359
Phillip, 15 years ago
I was driving a car...

947
00:51:46,393 --> 00:51:51,030
and you crossed
the street when I--

948
00:51:51,064 --> 00:51:53,199
when I was driving that car.

949
00:51:53,233 --> 00:51:56,102
And...and I hit you.

950
00:51:56,970 --> 00:51:58,671
I--I know.

951
00:51:58,705 --> 00:52:00,406
And, I'm...

952
00:52:00,440 --> 00:52:03,509
I'm here because
I have to come and...

953
00:52:03,543 --> 00:52:06,012
and come
clean with you--

954
00:52:06,046 --> 00:52:07,947
I understand.

955
00:52:07,981 --> 00:52:09,015
I'm--

956
00:52:09,049 --> 00:52:11,050
I'm the person who's
put you in the wheelchair.

957
00:52:11,084 --> 00:52:12,918
I understand.

958
00:52:12,953 --> 00:52:16,889
And it is...
very hard on me...

959
00:52:16,923 --> 00:52:19,825
to...bring that up.

960
00:52:20,660 --> 00:52:22,795
But it is a big burden
that I've been

961
00:52:22,829 --> 00:52:24,864
living with
for a long time.

962
00:52:24,898 --> 00:52:26,265
It's-- It's okay.

963
00:52:26,299 --> 00:52:28,067
It was me.

964
00:52:28,101 --> 00:52:30,069
I'm an immigrant, Phillip.

965
00:52:30,103 --> 00:52:32,004
I was not legal
when this happened.

966
00:52:32,039 --> 00:52:35,708
I've come to America
for...a dream.

967
00:52:35,742 --> 00:52:38,511
And I've come from very far
to work in this country

968
00:52:38,545 --> 00:52:42,748
and this would put me back
where I started, you know?

969
00:52:42,783 --> 00:52:44,917
This must be very,
very difficult for you.

970
00:52:44,951 --> 00:52:46,819
Very difficult for me.

971
00:52:46,853 --> 00:52:49,622
Do you want atonement?
You want forgiveness?

972
00:52:49,656 --> 00:52:51,724
<i>[playful chant]</i>

973
00:52:53,827 --> 00:52:55,027
You're forgiven.

974
00:52:55,062 --> 00:52:56,529
You're atoned.
You can leave.

975
00:52:56,563 --> 00:52:59,065
You can go.
You can be happy.

976
00:53:00,400 --> 00:53:03,502
I must tell you -
I'm not a rich man--

977
00:53:03,537 --> 00:53:05,304
What do you do?

978
00:53:05,339 --> 00:53:07,139
I design clothes--

979
00:53:07,174 --> 00:53:09,041
You're a designer?

980
00:53:09,076 --> 00:53:10,876
That's great.

981
00:53:10,911 --> 00:53:13,846
I'm really impressed
with people who can create,

982
00:53:13,880 --> 00:53:16,882
who can take,
like a piece of cloth and--

983
00:53:16,917 --> 00:53:18,784
Don't be impressed
with me, please, Phillip.

984
00:53:18,819 --> 00:53:20,686
It's the other
way around right here.

985
00:53:20,721 --> 00:53:22,188
You're being so kind with me.

986
00:53:22,222 --> 00:53:24,123
You're being
generous with me.

987
00:53:24,157 --> 00:53:26,625
You're greeting me
with a smile.

988
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:29,462
You're...you're showing me
forgiveness,

989
00:53:29,496 --> 00:53:31,630
and I feel undeserving
of all of that.

990
00:53:31,665 --> 00:53:33,933
I feel that, that I---

991
00:53:33,967 --> 00:53:36,702
my standards in life
are higher than

992
00:53:36,737 --> 00:53:39,372
what I've shown
you on that day.

993
00:53:39,406 --> 00:53:43,509
If this is a question of me
forgiving you...

994
00:53:43,543 --> 00:53:45,211
then I do.

995
00:53:45,245 --> 00:53:46,846
But I think this
might be a question

996
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,315
of you forgiving yourself.

997
00:53:49,349 --> 00:53:51,183
Maybe, Phillip.

998
00:53:51,218 --> 00:53:53,853
I don't know what you want.

999
00:53:53,887 --> 00:53:55,888
I brought money
with me, Phillip.

1000
00:53:55,922 --> 00:53:58,891
It's not...
a lot of money,

1001
00:53:58,925 --> 00:54:00,760
but it maybe can
make your life

1002
00:54:00,794 --> 00:54:04,730
a little bit more comfortable,
for a while, you know?

1003
00:54:04,765 --> 00:54:05,998
It's coming from my heart.

1004
00:54:06,033 --> 00:54:08,000
Is money
very important to you?

1005
00:54:08,035 --> 00:54:10,436
Money's important
to everybody, Phillip, and--

1006
00:54:10,470 --> 00:54:11,871
I think, uh...

1007
00:54:11,905 --> 00:54:13,639
I think you should leave.

1008
00:54:13,674 --> 00:54:15,241
Really.

1009
00:54:15,275 --> 00:54:16,942
I need you to leave my home.

1010
00:54:16,977 --> 00:54:19,045
- Please.
- No, please.

1011
00:54:53,246 --> 00:54:54,480
Phillip.

1012
00:55:02,956 --> 00:55:05,424
I heard you give
a class this morning

1013
00:55:05,459 --> 00:55:08,661
about things we
don't understand.

1014
00:55:08,695 --> 00:55:12,732
I need some
explanations, Phillip.

1015
00:55:12,766 --> 00:55:16,736
Can you help me with
some answers, please?

1016
00:55:18,672 --> 00:55:22,942
How can you be so
happy in this wheelchair?

1017
00:55:22,976 --> 00:55:27,880
How can you
possibly smile at me?

1018
00:55:27,914 --> 00:55:30,282
How can you
possibly smile at anyone?

1019
00:55:32,652 --> 00:55:36,322
What keeps you going?
What keeps you alive?

1020
00:55:36,356 --> 00:55:38,858
I need some answers, Phillip.

1021
00:55:40,994 --> 00:55:42,528
I'm lost.

1022
00:55:48,068 --> 00:55:50,703
My wife asked me to leave.

1023
00:56:00,781 --> 00:56:03,849
That means I can't
be with my little girl.

1024
00:56:11,725 --> 00:56:13,059
Hey.

1025
00:56:14,795 --> 00:56:16,796
You wanna go for a ride?

1026
00:56:18,265 --> 00:56:20,132
You drive?

1027
00:56:20,167 --> 00:56:21,634
Okay, come on.

1028
00:56:21,668 --> 00:56:23,703
Come on.
Let's go.

1029
00:56:30,043 --> 00:56:32,044
Are you coming or what?

1030
00:56:34,548 --> 00:56:36,082
Tell me -

1031
00:56:36,116 --> 00:56:38,384
why did you
come to America?

1032
00:56:39,152 --> 00:56:43,956
As a kid, I was selling figs
in the mountains of Lebanon.

1033
00:56:43,990 --> 00:56:47,326
And there's a man that came
from the U.S. Embassy.

1034
00:56:47,361 --> 00:56:51,564
His name was William O'Malley.

1035
00:56:51,598 --> 00:56:53,366
He tried to
negotiate me down

1036
00:56:53,400 --> 00:56:55,634
for a bunch of cases.

1037
00:56:55,669 --> 00:56:58,471
I wouldn't budge.
I would say, no.

1038
00:56:58,505 --> 00:57:01,941
He finally paid the full price,
and once that was done

1039
00:57:01,975 --> 00:57:06,312
I went ahead and I gave him
an extra case of figs.

1040
00:57:06,346 --> 00:57:09,115
And when I did that,
he looked at me and he said,

1041
00:57:09,149 --> 00:57:10,349
"You know what?

1042
00:57:10,384 --> 00:57:12,852
You should go to America."

1043
00:57:12,886 --> 00:57:16,922
A few years after that
I went to the U.S. Embassy

1044
00:57:16,957 --> 00:57:19,892
and I tried to get a visa.

1045
00:57:19,926 --> 00:57:22,094
They were not giving visas.

1046
00:57:22,129 --> 00:57:24,363
But William O'Malley had
written my name down

1047
00:57:24,398 --> 00:57:26,632
for a 90-day visa.

1048
00:57:26,667 --> 00:57:30,236
So, I came to America...

1049
00:57:30,270 --> 00:57:33,072
and I decided to stay.

1050
00:57:34,374 --> 00:57:37,677
<i>[music plays, singing]</i>

1051
00:57:48,121 --> 00:57:49,689
This is the coolest party.

1052
00:57:49,723 --> 00:57:51,757
- Who's the actor?
- Tyler Jensen.

1053
00:57:51,792 --> 00:57:53,592
I have no idea.
I'm sorry.

1054
00:57:53,627 --> 00:57:55,127
- Oh, that's okay.
- He's probably--

1055
00:57:55,162 --> 00:57:56,929
He's really amazing.
You'll love him.

1056
00:57:56,963 --> 00:57:58,764
He's one of
my better ones, too.

1057
00:57:58,799 --> 00:58:00,299
I like him.
He's a good person.

1058
00:58:17,050 --> 00:58:17,983
What's wrong?

1059
00:58:18,018 --> 00:58:19,218
Look.

1060
00:58:19,252 --> 00:58:20,820
It's my baby's clothes.

1061
00:58:20,854 --> 00:58:22,488
- It was on the floor?
- It's on the ground.

1062
00:58:22,522 --> 00:58:23,956
That's shitty.

1063
00:58:23,990 --> 00:58:25,691
Well, whoever
arrived with this

1064
00:58:25,726 --> 00:58:27,727
is not going
home with it.

1065
00:58:33,400 --> 00:58:35,267
You should go
and work the party.

1066
00:58:35,302 --> 00:58:37,336
I know that this is
kinda part of your job,

1067
00:58:37,371 --> 00:58:39,805
so go do your thing
and I'll be fine.

1068
00:58:39,840 --> 00:58:40,806
Are you--

1069
00:58:40,841 --> 00:58:42,842
Yes, I'm glad I came.
And you were so right.

1070
00:58:42,876 --> 00:58:44,410
And you're not
gonna start spiralling?

1071
00:58:44,444 --> 00:58:46,245
No, I will not spiral.

1072
00:58:46,279 --> 00:58:47,980
'Cuz there's no TV here
so I'm not gonna catch you

1073
00:58:48,015 --> 00:58:49,482
a few hours later
watching TV.

1074
00:58:49,516 --> 00:58:51,550
I will not be watching TV.
I promise you.

1075
00:58:51,585 --> 00:58:52,885
Please don't.

1076
00:58:52,919 --> 00:58:54,754
- You look really beautiful.
- So do you.

1077
00:58:54,788 --> 00:58:56,489
- Thank you.
- I'm proud of you.

1078
00:58:56,523 --> 00:58:57,790
Thank you, honey.

1079
00:58:57,824 --> 00:58:59,358
Thanks for coming out
and seeing my world.

1080
00:58:59,393 --> 00:59:00,760
Anyway...

1081
00:59:00,794 --> 00:59:02,628
Then I'll catch up
with you on the other

1082
00:59:02,662 --> 00:59:03,896
side of the pool.

1083
00:59:03,930 --> 00:59:05,131
And don't go down -
go up.

1084
00:59:05,165 --> 00:59:06,699
I won't.

1085
00:59:07,601 --> 00:59:09,201
What are you afraid of?

1086
00:59:10,504 --> 00:59:12,638
Failure.

1087
00:59:14,875 --> 00:59:17,109
Disappointing people I love.

1088
00:59:19,946 --> 00:59:21,347
Pain?

1089
00:59:21,381 --> 00:59:24,083
What is that?
Is there some pain?

1090
00:59:27,854 --> 00:59:29,455
From?

1091
00:59:30,724 --> 00:59:32,892
- Pain?
- Yes.

1092
00:59:34,895 --> 00:59:36,896
And you don't have any?

1093
00:59:39,666 --> 00:59:42,034
Pain...

1094
00:59:43,337 --> 00:59:45,137
No.

1095
00:59:45,172 --> 00:59:47,306
How can you
have no pain?

1096
00:59:49,242 --> 00:59:51,844
I have a story for you.

1097
00:59:53,413 --> 00:59:55,915
There's a man.

1098
00:59:55,949 --> 00:59:58,084
He lives in a village.

1099
00:59:58,118 --> 01:00:00,419
And he only has
his one stallion,

1100
01:00:00,454 --> 01:00:02,488
one horse.

1101
01:00:02,522 --> 01:00:05,725
And this horse does
all the work for him.

1102
01:00:05,759 --> 01:00:09,595
And then one day
the horse escapes.

1103
01:00:09,629 --> 01:00:11,497
It runs away.

1104
01:00:11,531 --> 01:00:13,933
And everyone in the village,
they come to him and they say,

1105
01:00:13,967 --> 01:00:15,901
oh, we are so sorry for you.

1106
01:00:15,936 --> 01:00:18,004
Now you are so poor.

1107
01:00:18,038 --> 01:00:23,142
And he says, maybe...
maybe not.

1108
01:00:23,176 --> 01:00:25,778
And then the next day
the horse returns

1109
01:00:25,812 --> 01:00:28,381
and it brings 20
mares with it.

1110
01:00:28,415 --> 01:00:31,317
And all the people in the
village come and they say,

1111
01:00:31,351 --> 01:00:33,452
oh, praise God.

1112
01:00:33,487 --> 01:00:35,888
You are the richest
man in the village.

1113
01:00:35,922 --> 01:00:38,124
You must be so happy.

1114
01:00:38,158 --> 01:00:40,092
And he says...

1115
01:00:40,127 --> 01:00:42,828
maybe, maybe not.

1116
01:00:42,863 --> 01:00:46,966
And then the next day
his son rides the stallion,

1117
01:00:47,000 --> 01:00:49,168
and he falls from it.

1118
01:00:49,202 --> 01:00:51,237
And he's paralyzed.

1119
01:00:51,271 --> 01:00:53,072
And all the villagers
come and said,

1120
01:00:53,106 --> 01:00:54,774
I'm so, so sorry.

1121
01:00:54,808 --> 01:00:57,476
You're the poorest of us all.
You've lost your son.

1122
01:00:57,511 --> 01:01:02,815
And he says, maybe...
maybe not.

1123
01:01:02,849 --> 01:01:04,483
And then the next day
there's a war,

1124
01:01:04,518 --> 01:01:07,953
and they call all the children
from the village to go to war.

1125
01:01:07,988 --> 01:01:10,856
And his son
stays behind

1126
01:01:10,891 --> 01:01:12,525
because he's paralyzed.

1127
01:01:12,559 --> 01:01:16,295
And they say,
oh, you must be so happy.

1128
01:01:16,329 --> 01:01:19,065
You got to keep your son,
because all of our sons

1129
01:01:19,099 --> 01:01:21,434
have perished in the war.

1130
01:01:21,468 --> 01:01:23,336
And he says...

1131
01:01:23,370 --> 01:01:27,440
maybe...maybe not.

1132
01:01:30,177 --> 01:01:33,179
Think...

1133
01:01:33,213 --> 01:01:37,049
life is guiding us
to something.

1134
01:01:37,084 --> 01:01:41,587
Bringing us to a place.

1135
01:01:41,621 --> 01:01:45,558
Trying to nudge us
in the right direction.

1136
01:01:45,592 --> 01:01:48,627
And I recognize it...
It's...

1137
01:01:48,662 --> 01:01:50,830
It's guiding me.

1138
01:01:50,864 --> 01:01:52,765
You're here.

1139
01:01:52,799 --> 01:01:55,368
Maybe the...

1140
01:01:55,402 --> 01:01:59,505
one of the threads
that I needed to unwind.

1141
01:01:59,539 --> 01:02:03,376
So I'm very happy.

1142
01:02:03,410 --> 01:02:11,217
You...are continuing
to live that moment.

1143
01:02:11,251 --> 01:02:15,388
And as a result,
you can't go forward.

1144
01:02:15,422 --> 01:02:17,757
For me...

1145
01:02:17,791 --> 01:02:24,263
something happened...
that hurt me.

1146
01:02:24,297 --> 01:02:27,266
Not you.

1147
01:02:27,300 --> 01:02:28,601
You stopped me
and you made me

1148
01:02:28,635 --> 01:02:32,038
have to look
at the way I loved.

1149
01:02:32,072 --> 01:02:34,774
How much I required
from the person that I love.

1150
01:02:34,808 --> 01:02:39,879
And I've had to continually
live it over and over again -

1151
01:02:39,913 --> 01:02:42,648
the thing that I most feared.

1152
01:02:42,683 --> 01:02:45,551
And now...

1153
01:02:45,585 --> 01:02:49,188
I understand it.

1154
01:02:49,222 --> 01:02:51,490
And I love more deeply.

1155
01:02:51,525 --> 01:02:53,659
Just because of that moment
that you stopped me

1156
01:02:53,694 --> 01:02:55,661
and you said,
stand still.

1157
01:02:55,696 --> 01:02:57,596
What you're about
to do is wrong.

1158
01:02:57,631 --> 01:02:59,098
Stand still.

1159
01:02:59,132 --> 01:03:02,935
What that...pain is from
doesn't really matter.

1160
01:03:02,969 --> 01:03:07,506
Stand still
and try to...understand.

1161
01:03:23,957 --> 01:03:25,458
Oh...

1162
01:03:26,827 --> 01:03:30,029
Okay, you caught me.
I'm sneaking out of the party.

1163
01:03:31,298 --> 01:03:33,366
By all means.

1164
01:03:33,400 --> 01:03:35,167
You okay?

1165
01:03:35,202 --> 01:03:38,170
Yeah.
I'm fine.

1166
01:03:38,205 --> 01:03:40,306
What ya' doin' out
here all by yourself?

1167
01:03:41,942 --> 01:03:44,477
What are you
doin' out here?

1168
01:03:44,511 --> 01:03:48,614
I just...well--

1169
01:03:48,648 --> 01:03:51,217
It's okay.
I'm doin' the same thing.

1170
01:03:51,251 --> 01:03:53,686
I don't really have anything
in common with those people

1171
01:03:53,720 --> 01:03:55,554
and it's this...

1172
01:03:55,589 --> 01:04:00,326
big party for some...
teen heartthrob.

1173
01:04:00,360 --> 01:04:01,627
And I have no idea
who he is

1174
01:04:01,661 --> 01:04:03,029
and I don't care.

1175
01:04:03,063 --> 01:04:04,864
And...

1176
01:04:04,898 --> 01:04:06,532
Have you ever had
a birthday party

1177
01:04:06,566 --> 01:04:08,901
where you didn't
actually know anyone there?

1178
01:04:08,935 --> 01:04:10,436
Maybe it was at
a restaurant or something

1179
01:04:10,470 --> 01:04:13,539
and they just let everyone
else sit at your table?

1180
01:04:14,441 --> 01:04:16,842
This is...your--

1181
01:04:16,877 --> 01:04:18,544
Yeah, you're sneaking
out of my birthday.

1182
01:04:18,578 --> 01:04:20,513
Oh, God.
I'm so sorry.

1183
01:04:20,547 --> 01:04:22,048
I don't blame you.

1184
01:04:22,082 --> 01:04:25,117
But if it's your
birthday party,

1185
01:04:25,152 --> 01:04:28,521
why don't you hang out
with all your buddies?

1186
01:04:28,555 --> 01:04:31,323
I mean, everybody seems
so excited to see you--

1187
01:04:31,358 --> 01:04:34,126
Those people are excited
to see me because...

1188
01:04:34,161 --> 01:04:36,462
I make them money.

1189
01:04:37,497 --> 01:04:40,299
Oh.
I get 'ya.

1190
01:04:40,334 --> 01:04:44,103
All the friends that I had -
before Tyler -

1191
01:04:44,137 --> 01:04:47,540
they're not here.
They don't exist anymore.

1192
01:04:51,812 --> 01:04:54,347
Does Tyler still exist?

1193
01:04:54,381 --> 01:04:55,915
I don't know.

1194
01:04:58,785 --> 01:05:00,619
I don't know.

1195
01:05:02,556 --> 01:05:05,291
And they want a character.

1196
01:05:05,325 --> 01:05:07,960
They want an action star
to walk out there.

1197
01:05:07,994 --> 01:05:11,097
They don't want
anyone who's broken...

1198
01:05:11,131 --> 01:05:13,099
or anyone who's scared,

1199
01:05:13,133 --> 01:05:15,334
or anyone who's lonely.

1200
01:05:16,169 --> 01:05:19,171
You know, my mom used
to always tell me that,

1201
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:22,742
if you're in a situation
and you don't like it,

1202
01:05:22,776 --> 01:05:25,811
you can always leave.

1203
01:05:25,846 --> 01:05:31,684
So there must be part of
you that wants to be here.

1204
01:05:36,256 --> 01:05:39,058
This is a day
that belongs to you -

1205
01:05:39,092 --> 01:05:41,093
nobody else.

1206
01:05:44,598 --> 01:05:46,232
You know what I mean?

1207
01:05:49,336 --> 01:05:51,237
I'm Tyler.

1208
01:05:51,271 --> 01:05:53,472
How you doing?
Sherry.

1209
01:05:53,507 --> 01:05:55,675
- Hi, Sherry.
- Hey.

1210
01:05:55,709 --> 01:05:57,910
Here, put this on.

1211
01:05:57,944 --> 01:05:59,912
I can't help it.
I'm a mother.

1212
01:05:59,946 --> 01:06:01,213
Come on.

1213
01:06:03,083 --> 01:06:06,052
I'm also a wife,
and I take care.

1214
01:06:06,086 --> 01:06:07,286
That's what I do.

1215
01:06:07,320 --> 01:06:08,788
There.

1216
01:06:11,258 --> 01:06:13,659
Thank you, Sherry.

1217
01:06:14,461 --> 01:06:16,295
Happy birthday.

1218
01:06:17,330 --> 01:06:19,231
Get out of here.

1219
01:06:41,655 --> 01:06:43,322
I'm tired.

1220
01:06:45,692 --> 01:06:47,727
I'm just tired.

1221
01:06:47,761 --> 01:06:50,363
You should sleep then.

1222
01:06:51,365 --> 01:06:55,935
The way I've been
thinking for all these years...

1223
01:06:55,969 --> 01:06:58,637
where my mind takes me.

1224
01:07:01,308 --> 01:07:07,279
Maybe it's because of
preconceived ideas...

1225
01:07:07,314 --> 01:07:10,649
of what things should be.

1226
01:07:13,687 --> 01:07:15,888
Like I wanna give
my wife and my child

1227
01:07:15,922 --> 01:07:19,291
something later in life.

1228
01:07:19,326 --> 01:07:21,994
And it's possible
that I'm allowing

1229
01:07:22,029 --> 01:07:28,567
the present to slide
for the sake of the future.

1230
01:07:28,602 --> 01:07:31,003
For the sake
of the past...

1231
01:07:31,038 --> 01:07:33,806
Instead of reaching
towards love.

1232
01:07:33,840 --> 01:07:37,443
So that you can
live in the light.

1233
01:08:01,802 --> 01:08:03,869
I'm sorry.

1234
01:08:06,740 --> 01:08:08,541
I'm sorry.

1235
01:08:14,781 --> 01:08:16,449
I'm tired.

1236
01:08:18,218 --> 01:08:20,252
That's all it is.

1237
01:08:21,221 --> 01:08:23,089
I'm sorry.

1238
01:08:35,702 --> 01:08:39,572
<i>[humming]</i>

1239
01:10:20,340 --> 01:10:21,507
Phillip.

1240
01:10:21,541 --> 01:10:23,776
Ah...

1241
01:10:23,810 --> 01:10:25,678
Found it.

1242
01:10:31,818 --> 01:10:34,320
This light...

1243
01:10:35,856 --> 01:10:40,926
This morning light
is magical, really.

1244
01:10:40,961 --> 01:10:43,396
It's magical.

1245
01:10:43,430 --> 01:10:49,268
It's when the air starts
to vibrate even stronger.

1246
01:10:49,302 --> 01:10:54,040
It's...it's almost like the
universe is taking a breath.

1247
01:10:54,074 --> 01:10:58,544
I think today, magic is
gonna happen for you.

1248
01:10:58,578 --> 01:11:03,149
For you...and for your daughter.

1249
01:11:03,183 --> 01:11:04,884
It's in the air.

1250
01:11:15,328 --> 01:11:17,363
It's funny...

1251
01:11:17,397 --> 01:11:20,366
how you think you've
buried the past -

1252
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,468
and it's right there.

1253
01:11:27,207 --> 01:11:29,575
Right in front of your eyes.

1254
01:11:39,086 --> 01:11:42,088
You stopped me from
making a terrible mistake.

1255
01:11:46,460 --> 01:11:49,462
I was gonna
do something that...

1256
01:11:53,100 --> 01:11:55,768
I would've had to...

1257
01:11:58,305 --> 01:12:02,675
try to take back again
and again and again.

1258
01:12:02,709 --> 01:12:08,948
But instead the thing
that I was trying to stop -

1259
01:12:08,982 --> 01:12:12,284
the reason I was
gonna use this -

1260
01:12:12,319 --> 01:12:16,522
was something I didn't
understand, I couldn't handle.

1261
01:12:16,556 --> 01:12:20,026
And I've had to live it
over and over again.

1262
01:12:21,128 --> 01:12:23,162
And you were part of that.

1263
01:12:23,196 --> 01:12:25,231
We can go now.

1264
01:12:34,374 --> 01:12:36,075
Let me get something.

1265
01:12:48,188 --> 01:12:50,423
- This is it.
- That's for me?

1266
01:12:50,457 --> 01:12:51,991
Thoughts become solid.

1267
01:12:52,025 --> 01:12:53,659
Words take form.

1268
01:12:53,694 --> 01:12:54,960
As if they weren't before.

1269
01:12:54,995 --> 01:12:56,996
This is a wonderful
gift you've given me.

1270
01:12:57,030 --> 01:12:58,698
And thank you
so much.

1271
01:12:58,732 --> 01:12:59,832
My pleasure.

1272
01:12:59,866 --> 01:13:01,500
Thank you.

1273
01:13:03,937 --> 01:13:05,104
Hey.

1274
01:13:05,138 --> 01:13:07,239
How was your trip?

1275
01:13:07,274 --> 01:13:10,176
Uh, okay.
What is he doing here?

1276
01:13:10,210 --> 01:13:12,144
He came to the club.
The next day--

1277
01:13:12,179 --> 01:13:13,479
Yeah, I know he's
the guy from the club.

1278
01:13:13,513 --> 01:13:15,481
I brought him back here
to fuck him, then...

1279
01:13:15,515 --> 01:13:16,682
I threw you out.

1280
01:13:16,717 --> 01:13:18,050
This is what I've been
working on all along.

1281
01:13:18,085 --> 01:13:19,919
This is the guy
who hit me that night.

1282
01:13:19,953 --> 01:13:21,954
And now,
he's come back here.

1283
01:13:21,988 --> 01:13:23,823
And we've been dealing
with some things--

1284
01:13:23,857 --> 01:13:26,125
Wait, wait...
What do you mean?

1285
01:13:26,159 --> 01:13:27,660
What do you mean?

1286
01:13:27,694 --> 01:13:29,161
He's the--

1287
01:13:29,196 --> 01:13:30,529
He's the guy
who hit you?

1288
01:13:30,564 --> 01:13:32,665
He's the guy
who did this?

1289
01:13:32,699 --> 01:13:34,633
He is, but what I'm saying
is there's a lot of things

1290
01:13:34,668 --> 01:13:36,302
that I wanted us
to be able to work on.

1291
01:13:36,336 --> 01:13:38,237
And I wanted to speak to
you, 'cuz I gotta clean out

1292
01:13:38,271 --> 01:13:39,772
the last little bit of this.

1293
01:13:39,806 --> 01:13:41,374
And I'm telling you
that this guy coming here -

1294
01:13:41,408 --> 01:13:42,842
it's like the true
ripple effect--

1295
01:13:42,876 --> 01:13:44,043
Honey, this is crazy.

1296
01:13:44,077 --> 01:13:45,978
It's why that happened
in the first place -

1297
01:13:46,013 --> 01:13:47,046
to bring us right here.

1298
01:13:47,080 --> 01:13:48,714
What are you
talking about?

1299
01:13:48,749 --> 01:13:51,017
What the fuck
are you doing here?

1300
01:13:51,051 --> 01:13:52,985
- It's a good thing.
- Who the fuck are you?!

1301
01:13:53,020 --> 01:13:54,920
How is it a good thing?

1302
01:13:54,955 --> 01:13:56,455
How is this a good thing?

1303
01:13:56,490 --> 01:13:57,890
You know what?
Get out!

1304
01:13:57,924 --> 01:13:59,525
Get the fuck out!
Get out!

1305
01:13:59,559 --> 01:14:01,260
You should go.

1306
01:14:01,294 --> 01:14:02,495
No, you know what?
Wait!

1307
01:14:02,529 --> 01:14:04,497
- You know what?
- Can I just talk to you?

1308
01:14:04,531 --> 01:14:05,965
You don't
get forgiveness!

1309
01:14:05,999 --> 01:14:07,066
Can I just talk
to you for a second?

1310
01:14:07,100 --> 01:14:08,968
I'm disabled, too.
You see him - that's me.

1311
01:14:09,002 --> 01:14:10,569
I don't have any fucking legs!

1312
01:14:10,604 --> 01:14:13,039
I don't have
any fucking legs!

1313
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:15,241
What are you doin' -
you come here?

1314
01:14:15,275 --> 01:14:17,677
You don't get amends.
You have to earn amends!

1315
01:14:17,711 --> 01:14:20,246
You take care of him for
the next 15 fucking years.

1316
01:14:20,280 --> 01:14:21,714
You wanna do that?

1317
01:14:21,748 --> 01:14:24,550
You wanna wipe his ass?

1318
01:14:24,584 --> 01:14:26,652
You don't get amends.
You feel the fucking guilt.

1319
01:14:26,687 --> 01:14:29,155
You feel it!
You don't <i>get</i> it.

1320
01:14:29,189 --> 01:14:30,890
How can you tell
me this is true?

1321
01:14:30,924 --> 01:14:33,159
This isn't true,
this isn't true.

1322
01:14:33,193 --> 01:14:35,294
You come in my house!

1323
01:14:35,328 --> 01:14:37,530
Who pays then?

1324
01:14:37,564 --> 01:14:39,565
Who fuckng pays?

1325
01:14:39,599 --> 01:14:41,367
Babe?!

1326
01:14:47,107 --> 01:14:48,474
I'm sorry.
I'm sorry!

1327
01:14:48,508 --> 01:14:49,842
No!

1328
01:14:56,717 --> 01:14:58,284
Fuck.

1329
01:15:01,688 --> 01:15:05,057
<i>[hearing various voices</i>
<i>from the past]</i>

1330
01:15:25,545 --> 01:15:27,413
<i>...Daddy's always at work.</i>

1331
01:15:27,614 --> 01:15:29,448
<i>Daddy!</i>

1332
01:15:30,717 --> 01:15:32,251
No!

1333
01:15:38,125 --> 01:15:39,925
What are you doing?

1334
01:15:41,194 --> 01:15:42,828
What are you doing?!

1335
01:15:50,003 --> 01:15:52,271
What are you doing?
I can't do this.

1336
01:15:53,240 --> 01:15:54,740
I can't do this.

1337
01:15:55,976 --> 01:15:57,309
Save him.

1338
01:15:57,344 --> 01:15:59,478
Go ahead, save him.

1339
01:16:00,714 --> 01:16:02,448
He saved you!

1340
01:16:04,918 --> 01:16:06,485
What?

1341
01:16:06,520 --> 01:16:10,122
If this man hadn't hit me,
I would've shot you.

1342
01:16:10,157 --> 01:16:12,658
What are you talking about?
Why would you shoot me?

1343
01:16:14,261 --> 01:16:16,662
Because you were
making love to that man

1344
01:16:16,697 --> 01:16:18,297
and I couldn't handle it.

1345
01:16:18,331 --> 01:16:21,734
And I got my gun...
and I tried to kill you.

1346
01:16:32,346 --> 01:16:34,847
Why didn't you tell me?

1347
01:16:34,881 --> 01:16:36,882
Why didn't you
fucking tell me?

1348
01:16:36,917 --> 01:16:38,818
I didn't know when
the right time was.

1349
01:16:38,852 --> 01:16:42,621
Fifteen fucking years?
And this is the right time?

1350
01:16:42,656 --> 01:16:44,123
Because I--

1351
01:16:44,157 --> 01:16:46,559
I didn't want you
to think I blamed you.

1352
01:16:46,593 --> 01:16:49,295
I didn't want you to think
that I was upset or that I--

1353
01:16:49,329 --> 01:16:51,897
I couldn't...
I didn't want you to--

1354
01:16:51,932 --> 01:16:53,632
I didn't feel.

1355
01:16:53,667 --> 01:16:55,468
I was trying to feel.

1356
01:16:55,502 --> 01:16:58,404
I was fucking him
to try and feel.

1357
01:16:58,438 --> 01:16:59,872
You'd gone.

1358
01:16:59,906 --> 01:17:01,707
You weren't there.

1359
01:17:03,076 --> 01:17:04,577
I'm sorry.

1360
01:17:04,611 --> 01:17:07,880
But I do feel, babe.
I feel deep.

1361
01:17:07,914 --> 01:17:10,750
I feel...I feel for you.

1362
01:17:10,784 --> 01:17:13,552
You can't see in my eyes
and tell how much I love you?

1363
01:17:59,533 --> 01:18:00,766
Baby...

1364
01:18:00,801 --> 01:18:02,068
My love...

1365
01:18:02,102 --> 01:18:03,636
My darling...

1366
01:18:03,670 --> 01:18:06,105
The only woman
I've ever loved...

1367
01:18:38,138 --> 01:18:40,606
(Phillip)
Everything comes from you.

1368
01:18:40,640 --> 01:18:43,709
You create your universe.

1369
01:18:43,744 --> 01:18:47,813
You're in a river of light.

1370
01:18:47,848 --> 01:18:53,886
Scream to the universe:
I am here!

1371
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:57,089
And you land...

1372
01:18:57,124 --> 01:19:00,192
and you scream
to the universe:

1373
01:19:00,227 --> 01:19:02,995
I am here!

1374
01:19:03,030 --> 01:19:06,132
And you're back
in the river again.

1375
01:19:06,166 --> 01:19:11,007
I am...
that I am.
