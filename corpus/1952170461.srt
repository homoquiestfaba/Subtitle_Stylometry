1
00:00:06,773 --> 00:00:10,174
This is the tale of
the mystic land of Mirabilis.

2
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:15,306
Freed from a dark tyrant hundreds
of years ago in an epic war.

3
00:00:16,483 --> 00:00:19,941
A war over Bloodsteel,
a magical enchanted metal

4
00:00:20,086 --> 00:00:24,147
so powerful it was used by sorcerers
and warriors alike.

5
00:00:24,357 --> 00:00:26,951
Once bountiful, now nearly gone,

6
00:00:27,260 --> 00:00:30,855
the fearful masses rooted for scraps
with fading hopes.

7
00:00:31,865 --> 00:00:35,699
The search began for
its legendary source, the Crucible.

8
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:40,570
Elven, Goblin and humans grew desperate
with each day

9
00:00:40,707 --> 00:00:44,609
as the leader of the dread Brood,
Dragoneye,

10
00:00:44,844 --> 00:00:47,278
unleashed his soilders of doom.

11
00:00:48,114 --> 00:00:55,077
He needed Bloodsteel to save his son
and an absolute dominion over Mirabilis.

12
00:00:56,589 --> 00:01:00,252
Freedom itself hung in the balance.

13
00:01:03,963 --> 00:01:07,057
Sire, it would seem this monk...

14
00:01:07,434 --> 00:01:08,901
...will tell us nothing.

15
00:01:09,402 --> 00:01:13,839
And we have no word of
the Crucible's whereabouts.

16
00:01:14,274 --> 00:01:19,041
The Oracle of Mirabilis
has knowledge of the map.

17
00:01:20,380 --> 00:01:26,751
Find him. Kill him if you have to
and even if you don't.

18
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:29,321
Yes, Lord Dragon Eye.

19
00:01:31,191 --> 00:01:34,718
And you, you wish to be silent?

20
00:01:39,933 --> 00:01:42,128
Then remain silent!

21
00:02:28,848 --> 00:02:29,576
Tesselink!

22
00:02:30,049 --> 00:02:32,882
Thank you for coming so quickly.
l have no time.

23
00:02:33,186 --> 00:02:38,886
Once again, evil covets the source
of all Bloodsteel, the Crucible.

24
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:43,960
Oracle, this is once
l hope your visions are faulty.

25
00:02:44,097 --> 00:02:45,997
The time of alignment is here.

26
00:02:46,132 --> 00:02:49,260
Within six days the planets
will align behind Alcyon.

27
00:02:49,469 --> 00:02:52,461
lf evil gets it's hands
on the Crucible whoever possesses

28
00:02:52,605 --> 00:02:54,903
it will weild untold power.

29
00:02:55,108 --> 00:02:59,738
But, uh, the Magus died centuries ago
in battle.

30
00:02:59,879 --> 00:03:02,712
Ah, but his heir, Dragon Eye,
is after it now.

31
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:05,750
Even though his days are numbered,
still he is searching.

32
00:03:05,885 --> 00:03:09,878
Only the four can keep
the Crucible out of his hands.

33
00:03:09,989 --> 00:03:11,286
Four legions?

34
00:03:11,391 --> 00:03:13,916
No, four knights. Four knights.

35
00:03:14,427 --> 00:03:20,297
l don't understand. Who are they?
These four. How will l know?

36
00:03:21,701 --> 00:03:31,406
When Mirabilis burns under the Dragon's
scorn four will join in one to mourn.

37
00:03:31,544 --> 00:03:33,341
l have no time for riddles!

38
00:03:33,479 --> 00:03:37,176
Only you know where
the Crucible can be found.

39
00:03:37,317 --> 00:03:39,751
My friend, the Crucible is a curse.

40
00:03:39,819 --> 00:03:44,483
But, the Crucible can provide a new hope
for Mirabilis with...

41
00:03:44,624 --> 00:03:47,320
...an endless supply Bloodsteel.

42
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:49,485
An and endless appetite for more power.

43
00:03:49,629 --> 00:03:52,655
For free people's to defend themselves.

44
00:03:53,900 --> 00:04:00,135
Even now, Dragon Eye's Brood cannot be
defeated by our combined armies.

45
00:04:05,778 --> 00:04:06,745
There is a map.

46
00:04:15,255 --> 00:04:19,123
Please, continue, oh Oracle.

47
00:04:20,593 --> 00:04:21,924
Azenhawke.

48
00:04:28,401 --> 00:04:35,967
You see what l do with those who
would thwart me or question Dragon Eye.

49
00:04:38,544 --> 00:04:42,605
Maybe you do not care what we do to you.

50
00:04:43,549 --> 00:04:46,985
Can you say the same for your children?

51
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:49,546
Speak.

52
00:04:57,263 --> 00:05:01,199
Then we will not stop until we have
killed every soul in the valley.

53
00:05:01,334 --> 00:05:04,235
Every village, every farm.

54
00:05:04,370 --> 00:05:05,632
You monsters.

55
00:05:05,838 --> 00:05:11,401
No. l do, however, work for one.

56
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:27,283
l will tell you. But, know this,
knowledge without wisdom is a curse!

57
00:05:27,427 --> 00:05:32,194
And denying Dragon Eye his birthright
is suicide.

58
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:40,568
Do you smell the eve of spring, my son?

59
00:05:42,008 --> 00:05:46,445
As sure as the stars align you
will see it for yourself.

60
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:49,745
When l have the Crucible it will be so.

61
00:05:51,384 --> 00:05:55,184
lt is the salvation for my mortality,

62
00:05:55,655 --> 00:06:00,217
your birthright as my heir
and your rule of Mirabilis.

63
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:12,266
ln times before the death of the Magus,

64
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:16,637
my forebears hid a map in a cave
at the headwaters of the Mulapeye.

65
00:06:16,909 --> 00:06:18,376
But, know this.

66
00:06:19,145 --> 00:06:23,707
lt is guarded by a dragon the likes of
which neither of you have ever seen.

67
00:06:23,883 --> 00:06:26,078
And you swear the legend is true?

68
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:29,053
Oracle's speak only truth.

69
00:07:14,434 --> 00:07:15,401
Grandfather!

70
00:07:17,537 --> 00:07:18,936
Was this the work of Dragon Eye?

71
00:07:19,071 --> 00:07:20,868
His lieutenant Azenhawke.

72
00:07:27,213 --> 00:07:29,443
Thank the gods for our gifts
of sorcery.

73
00:07:29,949 --> 00:07:32,713
Perfidia, listen to me.

74
00:07:33,119 --> 00:07:36,611
l fear he extorted directions
to the Crucible

75
00:07:36,756 --> 00:07:38,690
before he took the Oracle's life.

76
00:07:38,858 --> 00:07:43,761
You must stop him. Go. Go!

77
00:07:45,264 --> 00:07:49,963
Leave no stone unturned.
Peasants must know of the map.

78
00:07:50,403 --> 00:07:52,928
For riches like this l'd slit
my father's throat.

79
00:07:55,475 --> 00:07:58,842
lf you had one. Go.

80
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:02,611
This way.

81
00:08:31,444 --> 00:08:32,638
Breathe and die.

82
00:09:01,741 --> 00:09:02,708
Good morning.

83
00:09:30,736 --> 00:09:31,998
Magic lamp, sir. Magic lamp.

84
00:09:32,138 --> 00:09:34,072
Rub the magic lamp.
Only three left.

85
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:43,848
Malcolm, the uneasy truce between
the Brood

86
00:09:43,983 --> 00:09:46,508
and your guard
is about to become unraveled.

87
00:09:46,652 --> 00:09:48,950
Do we want to suffer the chaos again!

88
00:09:49,055 --> 00:09:49,987
l warned of this.

89
00:09:50,122 --> 00:09:53,250
While you humans and goblins argued
the Brood took advantage.

90
00:09:53,626 --> 00:09:56,356
Now the corrupt Brood underworld
infects the Keep.

91
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:59,665
So, now you blame us again.
Typical elven arrogance.

92
00:09:59,799 --> 00:10:01,733
And misguided human pride.

93
00:10:01,867 --> 00:10:03,630
Or goblin stubbornness!

94
00:10:03,769 --> 00:10:07,705
Please!
Enough of this endless bickering.

95
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:14,639
Only united can this triune
defeat Dragon Eye's brood!

96
00:10:15,147 --> 00:10:19,049
l don't think any of you fully
appreciate the urgency of our situation.

97
00:10:19,919 --> 00:10:23,980
lf Dragon Eye fulfills
his ancestor's promise

98
00:10:24,123 --> 00:10:29,618
and finds the Crucible
he will take all of Mirabilis.

99
00:10:31,163 --> 00:10:32,391
Then what are we to do?

100
00:10:33,466 --> 00:10:40,895
Before he was murdered
the Oracle made his own prophecy

101
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,903
that the defeat of Dragon Eye

102
00:10:46,746 --> 00:10:52,878
and the quest for the Crucible
will fall to four knights.

103
00:10:53,085 --> 00:10:54,382
Just four.

104
00:10:56,922 --> 00:11:01,950
l remember a time when blind men digging
with soup spoons could fill their carts

105
00:11:02,094 --> 00:11:05,530
with Bloodsteel and be home by sleep.

106
00:11:05,665 --> 00:11:09,499
Mm-hm. So l've heard, repeatedly.

107
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:16,900
That Bloodsteel is deader
than a goblin's tooth.

108
00:11:17,243 --> 00:11:20,178
That's a genuine Bloodsteel compass,
fresh as an elfs cheek.

109
00:11:20,312 --> 00:11:23,440
At least three moons on it.
Three-hundred cherigs on the street.

110
00:11:23,582 --> 00:11:25,277
And useless by morning!

111
00:11:25,418 --> 00:11:26,350
Ugh.

112
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:30,683
One day we'll wake up and
we'll have squandered every last ingot.

113
00:11:32,291 --> 00:11:33,087
One, two, three, four.

114
00:11:34,493 --> 00:11:35,482
l win!

115
00:11:39,265 --> 00:11:41,392
Maybe that's what
it'll take to ween us from it.

116
00:11:41,567 --> 00:11:44,832
l, for one, am not addicted.
Not to Bloodsteel anyway.

117
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,804
Really? What keeps your brew cold?

118
00:11:49,041 --> 00:11:50,235
Your street torches lit?

119
00:11:50,376 --> 00:11:52,207
Your militia one step ahead
of the Brood.

120
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:55,609
Oh, Orion, come.
Since when did you become a politician?

121
00:11:55,748 --> 00:11:57,443
Be four years this March.

122
00:11:58,084 --> 00:11:59,415
Such a commitment.

123
00:12:00,052 --> 00:12:00,848
Pay up.

124
00:12:05,458 --> 00:12:07,016
This should cover my gambling tab.

125
00:12:10,029 --> 00:12:11,291
Quite a ruckus outside.

126
00:12:21,574 --> 00:12:22,541
Good crowd.

127
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,500
You're missing an execution.

128
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,237
And it'll be yours too
if you don't clean your debt.

129
00:12:27,546 --> 00:12:28,535
Get a rope for it.

130
00:12:56,008 --> 00:12:58,340
This potion is your weapon.

131
00:13:06,252 --> 00:13:07,719
lt may be painful.

132
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:10,315
lt will pass.

133
00:13:20,332 --> 00:13:21,458
Do your duty.

134
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:26,966
People of the Keeps, hear me!

135
00:13:29,475 --> 00:13:32,171
For the willful and brutal murder

136
00:13:32,678 --> 00:13:35,545
and mutiliation of
the Oracle of Mirabilis,

137
00:13:37,283 --> 00:13:40,741
by the orders of
the duly elected members of the Triune

138
00:13:41,320 --> 00:13:45,188
and the justice nimrod Perfidia Aerie
who captured him.

139
00:13:47,126 --> 00:13:50,857
Lytreague Azenhawke,
you have been condemned to death.

140
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:56,867
Damn you, Swo...!

141
00:14:46,585 --> 00:14:47,483
Behind you!

142
00:15:09,541 --> 00:15:10,439
Stop him!

143
00:15:15,714 --> 00:15:16,237
No!

144
00:15:26,825 --> 00:15:27,814
Out of the way!

145
00:15:28,761 --> 00:15:29,921
Stay back!

146
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:31,957
Don't let him get away!

147
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:12,802
l knew Dragon Eye
wouldn't let me hang.

148
00:16:14,506 --> 00:16:18,499
Your Dragon Eyes had nothing to do
with this and you have not been saved.

149
00:16:19,678 --> 00:16:24,581
lf you hate me so much stranger
how is it you just saved my life?

150
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,708
So that l could take your life myself.

151
00:16:31,623 --> 00:16:32,385
Get up!

152
00:16:40,933 --> 00:16:42,560
You are mad.

153
00:17:03,188 --> 00:17:04,086
What's this about?

154
00:17:04,223 --> 00:17:06,987
My taking the life of
an Oracle in his dotage?

155
00:17:07,526 --> 00:17:11,587
Sheepherders in Orgenzal?
Miners at the Labyrinth?

156
00:17:11,864 --> 00:17:14,264
Revenge for the Elven schoolhouse?

157
00:17:20,606 --> 00:17:22,437
Or, maybe l bedded your wife.

158
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:35,709
Listen to me.

159
00:17:35,921 --> 00:17:39,482
Take your leave and l can get you
Bloodsteel beyond imagining.

160
00:17:39,658 --> 00:17:41,683
l have a secret to
a never-ending supply.

161
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,124
Then you'll die with it.

162
00:18:42,988 --> 00:18:44,979
Hey, gimme that. l found it first.

163
00:18:45,124 --> 00:18:45,988
The hell you did.

164
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:48,559
l had my hands on it
before you touched it.

165
00:18:48,694 --> 00:18:51,720
And, even if you did,
this is from my claim.

166
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:55,130
That's not right.
You're just being a bully.

167
00:18:55,267 --> 00:18:57,098
You are a thief.

168
00:18:59,571 --> 00:19:01,630
Look, we split it down the middle,
all right? Even-ethan.

169
00:19:01,773 --> 00:19:04,833
We each walk away with a nice bag
and nobody gets cranked.

170
00:19:05,644 --> 00:19:06,736
l don't think so.

171
00:19:08,780 --> 00:19:10,304
A finder's fee, then.

172
00:19:14,486 --> 00:19:17,580
Don't get any ideas.
This is my steel.

173
00:19:17,723 --> 00:19:20,851
Look, l'm just helping you.
And, the name's Talia.

174
00:19:24,329 --> 00:19:29,266
l am Ber-Lak. Ber...Lak.
lt's a goblin name.

175
00:19:29,434 --> 00:19:30,560
Never would've guessed.

176
00:19:30,869 --> 00:19:33,167
l like the ear-loops though.
Do they hurt?

177
00:19:33,572 --> 00:19:38,009
Not really.
And we both know you were poaching.

178
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:40,140
Ugh, it's not poaching.
lt's gleaning.

179
00:19:40,479 --> 00:19:42,037
And you're not going back
on your word.

180
00:19:42,548 --> 00:19:45,346
What word?
l never promised you anything.

181
00:19:45,918 --> 00:19:48,716
Oh, right. l'm just a lowly human.
What would be the point?

182
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:51,049
You know, l found that rock
under that sluice first.

183
00:19:51,990 --> 00:19:54,015
l still feel like l'm being short-poled.

184
00:19:54,393 --> 00:19:56,588
Really? Poacher.

185
00:19:56,995 --> 00:20:00,260
lt's probably the luckiest day
of your life.

186
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,221
Congratulations on your find.

187
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:28,493
Wow. Try to keep a secret
in Black Roc Keep. Gotta go.

188
00:20:28,627 --> 00:20:29,821
Don't play the fool.

189
00:20:30,295 --> 00:20:32,820
You know the Brood gets
a cut of everything on the street.

190
00:20:33,098 --> 00:20:35,794
Now tell us the exact location
of your claim.

191
00:20:37,236 --> 00:20:38,999
This goblin? Yeah.

192
00:20:39,137 --> 00:20:42,072
You don't wanna tangle with him.
Mean as they come.

193
00:20:42,207 --> 00:20:42,832
Talia.

194
00:20:42,975 --> 00:20:44,408
Take me to your claim.

195
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:53,347
And that one was for me too!

196
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:57,052
Lord Splayven won't let
this go unpunished.

197
00:21:04,129 --> 00:21:08,361
Picks up the Brood scum
and throws him like he's a baby!

198
00:21:08,834 --> 00:21:12,235
He is a goblin.
Goblin's do not fear the Brood!

199
00:21:12,504 --> 00:21:16,941
As if the Brood wasn't enough,
the dragons are waking up down there!

200
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:18,973
The whole bunch.

201
00:21:36,628 --> 00:21:39,222
You must have a set of steel
coming back here.

202
00:21:43,201 --> 00:21:48,161
We've not been formally introduced.
John Serragoth.

203
00:21:48,874 --> 00:21:50,705
Your reputation precedes you.

204
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,475
As does yours Lady Perfidia.

205
00:21:54,579 --> 00:21:57,946
l could have you arrested for
robbing people of their justice.

206
00:21:58,383 --> 00:21:59,850
Only momentarily.

207
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,752
And why would you say that?

208
00:22:03,555 --> 00:22:04,988
Have a wee look in the bag.

209
00:22:11,997 --> 00:22:14,431
Why free him and then kill him?

210
00:22:15,334 --> 00:22:19,703
Man kills with no conscience,
he deserves to die the same way.

211
00:22:21,139 --> 00:22:25,235
l'll have an ale for myself
and a quartzfire for the lady.

212
00:22:31,350 --> 00:22:32,817
What did Azenhawke do to you?

213
00:22:36,288 --> 00:22:37,482
He was on my list.

214
00:22:39,124 --> 00:22:43,356
So, it's true.
You're a paid assassin as they say.

215
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,959
You say that like it's a bad thing.

216
00:22:47,699 --> 00:22:51,157
Killing for hire with no regard
to guilt or innocence.

217
00:22:51,303 --> 00:22:53,965
Are you telling me you've sent
an innocent man to the gallows?

218
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:55,937
No, of course not.

219
00:22:56,241 --> 00:23:04,012
But, you actually traipse around
Mirabilis checking names off a list?

220
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:10,583
Aye. lt gives my life meaning.
As does your chainmail.

221
00:23:11,556 --> 00:23:13,581
lt doesn't come in your size.

222
00:23:13,725 --> 00:23:15,818
No, not in yours either. Thankfully.

223
00:23:20,232 --> 00:23:21,426
Try the quartzfire.

224
00:23:21,933 --> 00:23:25,801
They say that, uh,
Bloodsteel flakes spur desire.

225
00:23:28,039 --> 00:23:29,939
Yet, you choose to abstain.

226
00:23:31,977 --> 00:23:35,003
Just from Bloodsteel. l'm only human.

227
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:36,944
For that you have my sympathy.

228
00:23:40,719 --> 00:23:43,313
Perhaps you can assist me.

229
00:23:44,156 --> 00:23:45,851
Well, l'd like nothing more.

230
00:23:46,525 --> 00:23:47,457
Nothing more?

231
00:23:48,827 --> 00:23:49,555
Nothing.

232
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:53,489
Whatever happened to chivalry?

233
00:23:53,698 --> 00:23:56,326
Well, now, that's not a question
that keeps me awake at night.

234
00:23:59,805 --> 00:24:01,898
You just want your next beheading.

235
00:24:02,774 --> 00:24:05,971
l'm after something far more important.

236
00:24:06,912 --> 00:24:08,402
Oh, and what's that?

237
00:24:09,581 --> 00:24:12,141
You want information
about Azenhawke's cadre.

238
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:16,412
Tomorrow l'm meeting someone who may
have knowledge of their whereabouts.

239
00:24:18,390 --> 00:24:19,322
l'm listening.

240
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:21,790
You are welcome to join me.

241
00:24:27,866 --> 00:24:29,800
His name is John Serragoth.

242
00:24:29,935 --> 00:24:32,904
The same newcomer from the Moorlands
who saved Azenhawke from hanging

243
00:24:33,038 --> 00:24:36,974
and then killed him.
An assassin for hire l'm told.

244
00:24:38,176 --> 00:24:40,610
l sense a deeper purpose.

245
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:45,043
When he murdered Azenhawke
he may have snuffed out

246
00:24:45,183 --> 00:24:47,583
the secret of the Crucible's location.

247
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:51,178
Unless he extracted the secret
from Azenhawke first.

248
00:24:53,892 --> 00:25:01,424
Find out more of this Serragoth.
His family, his weakness.

249
00:25:02,834 --> 00:25:08,136
l want him alive at least
until he serves his purpose.

250
00:25:08,807 --> 00:25:11,970
Our man has been beaten
and chased from the Keep.

251
00:25:12,444 --> 00:25:16,278
We're being made fools of.
This is no time for half measures!

252
00:25:16,414 --> 00:25:18,644
We need to make an example of Mirabilis!

253
00:25:19,651 --> 00:25:22,449
Fear is the great deterrent.

254
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:28,850
lf the residents of the Keep
are growing emboldened, then so shall l.

255
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,118
Gather 'round citizens!

256
00:25:32,364 --> 00:25:34,855
Centuries ago we were pulled forth

257
00:25:35,000 --> 00:25:38,163
from the mud by
that gift from the heavens.

258
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:42,630
lt is the very magic that turns
the gears of Mirabilis!

259
00:25:42,807 --> 00:25:46,436
l speak of course of Bloodsteel.

260
00:25:48,613 --> 00:25:53,050
lt is our life blood
lt is the air we breathe.

261
00:25:53,184 --> 00:25:55,277
The key to instant wealth.

262
00:25:55,887 --> 00:25:59,084
Observe, what happens
to one piece effects the other.

263
00:25:59,591 --> 00:26:03,152
Heat it. Spin it. Just think it.
And it will be so.

264
00:26:04,129 --> 00:26:09,157
But, what good is all this Bloodsteel

265
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:13,465
if your love life is less
than it might be. Hm.

266
00:26:13,772 --> 00:26:14,830
All that is in the past.

267
00:26:14,973 --> 00:26:17,407
Starting today,
employing forbidden secrets

268
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:22,741
from the lair of Dragon Eye himself,
citizens of the Keep,

269
00:26:23,114 --> 00:26:28,484
l give you the
Bloodsteel machina passionata.

270
00:26:30,689 --> 00:26:34,181
A simple device that guarantees
unbated nights of bliss.

271
00:26:35,360 --> 00:26:38,029
All the Bloodsteel is dead around here.

272
00:26:38,029 --> 00:26:42,432
Ah, l know times, times are tough.
Pure steel rare.

273
00:26:42,968 --> 00:26:49,703
For this night l will also throw
in the Pyramid reanimator.

274
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:53,641
Guaranteed to extend the life force
of your Bloodsteel twice fold.

275
00:26:54,512 --> 00:26:56,480
Sentiments may vary based
on personal usage.

276
00:26:56,615 --> 00:27:00,608
Once these are gone friends
l cannot get more.

277
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:01,379
How much?

278
00:27:01,519 --> 00:27:07,754
Ten sherigs. Guaranteed to earn
its cost back on its virgin outing.

279
00:27:10,261 --> 00:27:11,922
So simple, even a comp-,

280
00:27:12,998 --> 00:27:15,967
even a refined gentleman
such as yourself can use it.

281
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,193
You two know each other?

282
00:27:18,303 --> 00:27:23,366
No. l'm sure l would remember
that defined and devout,

283
00:27:23,508 --> 00:27:27,774
devout is what l meant to say.
Devout and ample...

284
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:30,071
But, mainly devout!

285
00:27:31,116 --> 00:27:32,242
Hey, Adric.

286
00:27:33,918 --> 00:27:35,317
Can't you see l'm busy, Talia.

287
00:27:35,687 --> 00:27:38,656
Oh, l just thought you'd like to know
that l found a twenty-cadder yesterday.

288
00:27:38,923 --> 00:27:39,890
Sorcery grade.

289
00:27:40,859 --> 00:27:41,757
Sort of.

290
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:45,353
Aye. And you threw it all away
by stiffing Splayven's men.

291
00:27:45,497 --> 00:27:46,657
lt's all over the Keep.

292
00:27:47,198 --> 00:27:49,598
Well, somebody had to stand up to them.

293
00:27:49,934 --> 00:27:52,562
You and this vagabond goblin
are going to take on the Brood.

294
00:27:52,904 --> 00:27:55,372
You do know that Splayven
is a heart-beat away from Dragon Eye.

295
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,639
What are a few cads of Bloodsteel
to crooks like them?

296
00:27:58,810 --> 00:28:00,835
You have no idea how serious this is.

297
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:02,402
Then help me.

298
00:28:04,049 --> 00:28:05,539
Pick a fight with those icebloods.

299
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:08,686
That's the beauty of it.
See, l already did that.

300
00:28:08,987 --> 00:28:10,420
Honestly, l don't know why l even...

301
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:12,752
...try.

302
00:28:13,558 --> 00:28:13,853
Run.

303
00:28:13,992 --> 00:28:15,050
Dragon!

304
00:28:34,512 --> 00:28:35,809
Man the pumps!

305
00:28:37,816 --> 00:28:39,647
Get those fires out now!

306
00:28:41,453 --> 00:28:42,920
What good is talk?

307
00:28:43,221 --> 00:28:45,781
We have had no dragons
in Black Roc until now.

308
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:47,787
You tell us your plan for finding
the cursed Crucible

309
00:28:47,926 --> 00:28:49,484
and we will give you anything you need.

310
00:28:49,627 --> 00:28:51,561
Dragon Eye controls this beast.

311
00:28:51,896 --> 00:28:55,832
Dragon Eye!?!
A handful of knights against his power.

312
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:58,829
He has control of this dragon
and you think

313
00:28:58,970 --> 00:29:02,872
that four can take him down
when Malcolm's army is helpless!?!

314
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:05,534
Well, forgive my cynicism,
but how long has Dragon Eye eluded us?

315
00:29:05,677 --> 00:29:08,373
We ignore the Oracle's augury
at our peril!

316
00:29:08,513 --> 00:29:11,710
Did he happen to give you the identities
of these miracle warriors?

317
00:29:11,816 --> 00:29:15,616
He said my sorcery would provide
the names when the time was right.

318
00:29:16,254 --> 00:29:18,279
Finding the four is only the first step!

319
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:21,290
l need all of your assent
in empowering them.

320
00:29:21,426 --> 00:29:23,155
The reality is, if we do not find

321
00:29:23,294 --> 00:29:25,888
the Crucible before Dragon Eye does
then we are doomed.

322
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:27,895
Fine. Empower them.

323
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:34,567
Have no illusions, Dragon Eye employs
the greatest minds in weapons craft.

324
00:29:34,706 --> 00:29:36,503
He uses Bloodsteel like no other.

325
00:29:36,708 --> 00:29:39,609
Do not forget he decends
from the greatest sorcerer of all.

326
00:29:39,878 --> 00:29:43,746
Knights will have their own sorcerer
on their side.

327
00:29:43,882 --> 00:29:45,076
They will not fail.

328
00:30:00,498 --> 00:30:02,329
What have we heard from Swope?

329
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:03,759
Nothing, sire.

330
00:30:07,972 --> 00:30:14,172
Yes, run. Run as far as you can.

331
00:30:16,381 --> 00:30:19,680
Sire, l still believe that Swope
and his men will secure the Crucible

332
00:30:19,818 --> 00:30:21,012
and deliver it to your eminence.

333
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:26,021
Fool, Swope is a self-serving mercenary.

334
00:30:27,192 --> 00:30:30,628
We will let him do the work of finding
the Crucible for us.

335
00:30:30,795 --> 00:30:33,662
Then, we shall deal with him

336
00:30:33,798 --> 00:30:36,892
as l shall deal
with all those who oppose me.

337
00:30:37,101 --> 00:30:46,169
They will see the truth and when
l awaken my son a dynasty will be born.

338
00:30:47,345 --> 00:30:53,250
They will worship him and
he will shine for a thousand years.

339
00:30:54,118 --> 00:30:58,077
With me, the mightiest
of dragon's watching over him.

340
00:30:59,257 --> 00:31:00,451
l'm sure they will.

341
00:31:13,571 --> 00:31:17,371
Do not doubt me Lord Splayven!

342
00:31:17,809 --> 00:31:22,303
And never set yourself between me
and my heir's destiny.

343
00:31:23,181 --> 00:31:27,208
The day fast approaches
when Mirabilis will be his.

344
00:31:45,403 --> 00:31:48,839
Serragoth with Tesselink's vixen of
a granddaughter.

345
00:31:48,940 --> 00:31:50,339
You couldn't ask for more.

346
00:31:50,742 --> 00:31:53,540
Watch your words, fool.
He raised her well.

347
00:31:54,479 --> 00:31:57,039
Capturing her will be no easy task.

348
00:31:57,749 --> 00:32:02,914
Apologies sire. But, don't worry.
l know this kind well.

349
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:07,981
They will be in my han-,
our hands by nightfall.

350
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:12,128
Perhaps. But, l tire of your schemes.

351
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:16,063
Let us introduce them to my little pet,
shall we?

352
00:32:19,771 --> 00:32:21,534
My sources in the Keep told me

353
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:24,540
that certain Brood marauders paid
you a visit.

354
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:26,437
Not two days ago.

355
00:32:26,611 --> 00:32:30,342
They claimed l was concealing
a Bloodsteel find.

356
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:32,615
Demanded l show them where it was.

357
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:33,942
They looked at my son,

358
00:32:34,385 --> 00:32:38,719
said it would be a shame
to see him grow up with no hands.

359
00:32:40,024 --> 00:32:41,423
You're certain they were Brood?

360
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:43,985
They called their leader Swope.

361
00:32:44,562 --> 00:32:47,326
Did he have markings on his face.

362
00:32:48,533 --> 00:32:49,261
Yes.

363
00:32:50,868 --> 00:32:53,302
He complained it was a waste of time

364
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:57,568
to keep scrounging for crumbs
when the mother lode was in reach.

365
00:32:58,076 --> 00:33:03,013
My boy Angus heard them talk of
a journey to claim a map.

366
00:33:03,314 --> 00:33:05,077
Oh, the Crucible.

367
00:33:05,850 --> 00:33:08,478
Crucible? You believe
in that old legend.

368
00:33:09,387 --> 00:33:11,878
Well, at least it explains
what Azenhawke meant.

369
00:33:13,324 --> 00:33:14,018
And?

370
00:33:14,158 --> 00:33:17,321
Well, pleading for his life
he mentioned something

371
00:33:17,462 --> 00:33:19,794
about an endless supply of Bloodsteel.

372
00:33:19,931 --> 00:33:21,330
And yet, you killed him anyway?

373
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:22,831
Aye, he was on my list.

374
00:33:22,967 --> 00:33:26,300
And you came within a hairs breadth
of executing him yourself.

375
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:29,404
Do you never grow tired
of this pursuit?

376
00:33:30,341 --> 00:33:33,037
Have you ever thought
of fighting for a cause?

377
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:36,237
For life? For freedom?

378
00:33:36,981 --> 00:33:40,940
Aye, mine.
No Crucible is worth dying for.

379
00:33:43,421 --> 00:33:45,150
Did you overhear where they were headed?

380
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:47,717
He doesn't speak.

381
00:33:49,827 --> 00:33:56,824
No. Only that the map is guarded
by a dragon.

382
00:33:58,469 --> 00:34:05,773
They need our Bloodsteel to forge
more arrowheads to slay the...dragon.

383
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:32,829
Run!

384
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:51,715
Remarkable.

385
00:35:24,288 --> 00:35:28,850
Enough games.
Soon you will be in my grasp.

386
00:35:28,993 --> 00:35:31,461
John! Over here!

387
00:35:32,263 --> 00:35:33,321
What are you doin'!?!

388
00:35:33,464 --> 00:35:35,625
John! The Bloodsteel harness!

389
00:35:35,766 --> 00:35:38,326
You have one chance to dislodge it!

390
00:35:51,682 --> 00:35:52,478
Come on.

391
00:36:04,896 --> 00:36:07,694
John! John!

392
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:10,434
John!

393
00:36:11,536 --> 00:36:12,560
John!

394
00:36:15,239 --> 00:36:15,967
John!

395
00:36:16,474 --> 00:36:21,036
Whoo-Hoo! Whoo! Did you see that!?!

396
00:36:23,447 --> 00:36:27,213
Magnificent! A four-winger at that!
Eh!?!

397
00:36:28,853 --> 00:36:30,343
l never stood a chance!

398
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:33,287
l gaffed that dragon
like it was standing still!

399
00:36:33,391 --> 00:36:36,792
And l was magnificent! Ahh!

400
00:36:38,229 --> 00:36:39,753
l mean, you were good, but l...

401
00:36:49,941 --> 00:36:53,035
My sword. l...l...l've lost my sword.

402
00:36:57,148 --> 00:36:58,877
Come her, lad. Great hunting!

403
00:37:09,427 --> 00:37:10,985
Oh, now what have we here?

404
00:37:16,033 --> 00:37:17,091
Hello, you.

405
00:37:30,715 --> 00:37:32,239
Bring me those two.

406
00:37:32,550 --> 00:37:34,074
lt is already done.

407
00:37:42,260 --> 00:37:44,421
Ber-Lak, don't be afraid.

408
00:37:44,562 --> 00:37:47,793
You must accept your fate.
What you are describing...

409
00:37:47,932 --> 00:37:50,332
...the invisibility,
the unexplained strength,

410
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:52,902
the lightheadedness,
the disorientation...

411
00:37:53,037 --> 00:37:56,006
lt's being around
that much pure Bloodsteel.

412
00:37:56,140 --> 00:37:57,232
lt has happened before.

413
00:37:57,375 --> 00:37:59,104
We are goblins, Ber-Lak.

414
00:37:59,277 --> 00:38:01,609
And, among the goblins there
have always been a few,

415
00:38:01,912 --> 00:38:06,144
an order of magnitude more susceptible
to Bloodsteel's powers than others.

416
00:38:06,350 --> 00:38:09,842
The most extreme cases were recruited
as vessels for powers,

417
00:38:09,987 --> 00:38:11,818
vessels for lost souls.

418
00:38:12,056 --> 00:38:15,082
l told you, l'm not a damn vessel.

419
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,818
Embrace your gift.

420
00:38:16,961 --> 00:38:21,227
You want me to feel good about being
inhabited by another soul?

421
00:38:21,565 --> 00:38:27,765
Like a puppet. Without free
will you're not really a person.

422
00:38:29,206 --> 00:38:30,639
You're not a person at all.

423
00:38:30,941 --> 00:38:32,135
lt's a gift.

424
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,445
lt's my own gifts l'm seeking.

425
00:38:46,090 --> 00:38:47,352
Not someone elses.

426
00:38:51,529 --> 00:38:54,692
The Brood! They've taken her.
They've taken Talia.

427
00:38:54,832 --> 00:38:56,094
Please, we must go after her.

428
00:38:56,434 --> 00:38:57,025
Here.

429
00:38:59,303 --> 00:39:00,702
Take this. You may need it.

430
00:39:00,838 --> 00:39:02,032
Please. Come now.

431
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:02,798
Go!

432
00:39:15,486 --> 00:39:19,923
Don't worry my dear.
l will be merciful.

433
00:39:28,332 --> 00:39:29,060
What is it?

434
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:34,899
lt's unclear.
A child calling for help.

435
00:39:35,106 --> 00:39:35,834
The Brood?

436
00:39:36,841 --> 00:39:37,671
Perhaps.

437
00:39:39,310 --> 00:39:40,470
A trap, no doubt.

438
00:39:42,313 --> 00:39:45,805
How do you know this?
Are you using Bloodsteel magic?

439
00:39:46,150 --> 00:39:47,378
Do you object?

440
00:39:48,519 --> 00:39:53,388
Magic used is magic abused.
Will they harm this child?

441
00:39:54,091 --> 00:39:57,026
lf you know them, it will be
the least of their intentions.

442
00:39:57,995 --> 00:39:59,121
Well, how close are they?

443
00:40:26,891 --> 00:40:27,755
Let her go!

444
00:40:32,830 --> 00:40:37,096
John Serragoth and Perfidia Aerie.
Mm-mm.

445
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:42,569
You didn't disappoint.
Welcome to this hallowed ground.

446
00:40:43,040 --> 00:40:45,304
We only want the child unharmed.

447
00:40:46,076 --> 00:40:50,945
Aye. Let the child go,
unless of course you'd rather negotiate.

448
00:40:52,650 --> 00:40:53,412
Talia!

449
00:40:53,584 --> 00:40:54,380
Adric.

450
00:41:01,058 --> 00:41:02,491
John Serragoth, l presume.

451
00:41:02,626 --> 00:41:03,354
The same.

452
00:41:03,828 --> 00:41:05,887
You have made this easy for me.

453
00:41:06,030 --> 00:41:08,555
You've all answered
my little invitation.

454
00:41:08,833 --> 00:41:10,164
l told you it was a trap.

455
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:12,263
This will not end well.

456
00:41:12,536 --> 00:41:16,370
Only if you fail to reveal what
Azenhawke told you about the Crucible.

457
00:41:16,440 --> 00:41:20,501
Oh, well, unfortunately he lost
his head before he lost his tongue.

458
00:41:27,384 --> 00:41:31,377
Splayven, l have the information
that you seek.

459
00:41:32,056 --> 00:41:36,083
Azenhawke wrote down the night
before his execution.

460
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:42,098
He said he learned the path
to the Crucible, from the Oracle.

461
00:41:44,969 --> 00:41:46,994
You have no idea where the Crucible is!

462
00:41:48,472 --> 00:41:50,064
This is a fool's errand!

463
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:50,706
Stop!

464
00:41:50,808 --> 00:41:51,570
Swope!

465
00:41:55,012 --> 00:41:55,876
Swope?

466
00:41:56,180 --> 00:41:59,343
Aye, you find Swope,
you'll find the Crucible.

467
00:41:59,483 --> 00:42:00,541
He seeks it for himself.

468
00:42:00,684 --> 00:42:01,673
Are you crazy?

469
00:42:02,086 --> 00:42:03,883
No, l'm desperate.
l'm telling you the truth.

470
00:42:04,021 --> 00:42:05,215
Now let the girl go.

471
00:42:05,656 --> 00:42:08,955
ln point of fact, you have corroborated
what we've suspected.

472
00:42:09,627 --> 00:42:11,891
And now your usefulness has ceased.

473
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:18,196
He's yours!

474
00:43:25,402 --> 00:43:26,596
What took you so long?

475
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,073
At least mine stayed down.

476
00:43:35,079 --> 00:43:38,606
Talia. Talia. Talia.

477
00:43:45,322 --> 00:43:47,051
l'm sorry. l'm sorry, Talia.

478
00:43:50,461 --> 00:43:52,793
Help her. Help her!

479
00:43:53,664 --> 00:43:58,294
l have Bloodsteel. You have powers.
Please! Help her!

480
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:00,963
l cannot bring her spirit back.

481
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:09,444
No. No. No. No.

482
00:44:33,771 --> 00:44:38,401
When Mirabilis burns
under dragon's scorn...

483
00:44:38,909 --> 00:44:44,643
...the four will join as one to mourn.

484
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:47,047
What is it?

485
00:44:47,818 --> 00:44:55,725
Dragon Eye has unwittingly chosen
the instruments of his own demise.

486
00:44:57,594 --> 00:45:05,626
Fellow members of the Triune, Captain,
the Oracle's prophecy has come to pass.

487
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:10,729
We have our knights. We have the four!

488
00:45:14,645 --> 00:45:18,877
They're untried amateurs.
What do you seriously expect of them?

489
00:45:20,317 --> 00:45:22,342
That they find the Crucible.

490
00:45:23,187 --> 00:45:30,650
That they destroy Dragon Eye!
That they save Mirabilis.

491
00:47:07,424 --> 00:47:09,085
Have you been standing here for long?

492
00:47:10,794 --> 00:47:11,317
Nope.

493
00:47:14,198 --> 00:47:15,290
What do you want?

494
00:47:19,236 --> 00:47:21,204
lt's, uh, more what they want.

495
00:47:24,441 --> 00:47:25,669
Don't feel so bad.

496
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:28,302
lt happens.

497
00:47:29,613 --> 00:47:32,514
Maybe you should
try your Machina Passionata?

498
00:47:33,817 --> 00:47:37,844
Heh. lt doesn't work.

499
00:47:42,192 --> 00:47:45,252
l mean, it works. Normally.

500
00:47:46,296 --> 00:47:48,821
Mm. That's what they say.

501
00:47:52,436 --> 00:47:53,334
Who's they?

502
00:47:56,907 --> 00:47:58,636
Half the young women in the Keep.

503
00:48:01,445 --> 00:48:05,905
They also say that
you can get your hands on money

504
00:48:06,783 --> 00:48:10,617
as easily as you can the flesh
of a maiden.

505
00:48:23,734 --> 00:48:26,726
Get your things.
The Triune wants a word.

506
00:48:53,563 --> 00:48:56,396
lt is a sacred trust, John Serragoth.

507
00:48:56,934 --> 00:49:02,099
Moreover, it is your duty to serve
the free people's of Mirabilis.

508
00:49:02,406 --> 00:49:04,772
Oh, l see.
They get to be free but we don't.

509
00:49:05,642 --> 00:49:07,803
You'll enjoy your freedom
when the job is done.

510
00:49:08,278 --> 00:49:10,303
And what is this job?

511
00:49:15,552 --> 00:49:19,010
The one to which you alone
have already devoted yourself.

512
00:49:19,856 --> 00:49:22,916
Finding the Crucible.

513
00:49:23,093 --> 00:49:25,561
Well, l have no interest
in this knighthood.

514
00:49:25,896 --> 00:49:28,126
Ah, nor do l, to be honest.

515
00:49:28,231 --> 00:49:33,225
Really? You must, uh,
feel very strongly to resort to honesty.

516
00:49:33,403 --> 00:49:36,566
You don't want your young sister
to have died in vain, do you?

517
00:49:37,841 --> 00:49:38,899
More to the point Adric,

518
00:49:39,409 --> 00:49:43,038
l've paid off all
your considerable obligations

519
00:49:43,380 --> 00:49:46,816
and to be blunt, l now own you.

520
00:49:46,917 --> 00:49:48,544
Yeah, well you don't own me.

521
00:49:49,086 --> 00:49:53,079
Oh, and you John.
You need us as much as we need you.

522
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:57,860
l pledge the resources of the guard
to help you track down each

523
00:49:57,995 --> 00:50:02,432
and every man on your list provided

524
00:50:02,733 --> 00:50:04,997
that you devote yourself
to our mission first.

525
00:50:07,070 --> 00:50:11,439
And, Ber-Lak,
Orion tells me that you recoil

526
00:50:11,575 --> 00:50:14,806
at the roll of the vessel nature
has thrust upon you.

527
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:19,338
l can tell you destiny
has greater plans for you,

528
00:50:19,850 --> 00:50:26,016
but they can only be found in service
for this quest for the Crucible.

529
00:50:27,257 --> 00:50:28,588
She should have told you

530
00:50:29,960 --> 00:50:34,863
that the only roll l seek
is one of my own choosing.

531
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:41,670
Yes, well, Sir John doesn't even
believe the Crucible exists.

532
00:50:41,738 --> 00:50:43,797
He doesn't need to believe
in it's existence.

533
00:50:44,107 --> 00:50:45,506
You just need to find it.

534
00:50:45,642 --> 00:50:47,041
l wish we had answers.

535
00:50:48,245 --> 00:50:51,612
You remain this world's best hope.

536
00:50:52,082 --> 00:50:57,247
Find Swope, get the Crucible,
destroy Dragon Eye.

537
00:50:58,355 --> 00:51:03,292
The Oracle placed his faith
in the four of you.

538
00:51:03,960 --> 00:51:06,656
l don't recommend you second guess him.

539
00:51:17,040 --> 00:51:21,875
With this sword and with the zephyr
of freedom lofting your wings,

540
00:51:22,345 --> 00:51:24,813
l dub you knights of Mirabilis.

541
00:51:30,387 --> 00:51:31,752
Will you come forth?

542
00:52:50,934 --> 00:52:54,927
The steel calls. Listen for it.
Then act.

543
00:52:57,908 --> 00:52:58,431
Damn.

544
00:52:58,875 --> 00:53:01,844
That's all right.
These things take time.

545
00:53:02,779 --> 00:53:08,649
Grandfather, l've learned speed.
l've learned the second sight.

546
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:11,716
When are you going to tell me
about the third gift?

547
00:53:11,855 --> 00:53:17,691
Such impatience. Learn the first two.
Earn the third.

548
00:53:18,762 --> 00:53:20,423
l don't understand.

549
00:53:20,564 --> 00:53:21,861
Ah, you won't for a while.

550
00:53:21,998 --> 00:53:26,662
But l can tell you this,
both pale against the third gift.

551
00:53:26,803 --> 00:53:29,294
Now, back to the first.

552
00:53:37,814 --> 00:53:39,008
Excellent.

553
00:53:40,217 --> 00:53:41,445
Excellent.

554
00:53:42,485 --> 00:53:44,009
How fares the goblin?

555
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:45,846
Ber-Lak?

556
00:53:47,991 --> 00:53:50,425
He must've become infected
with invisibility

557
00:53:50,560 --> 00:53:53,723
when he came in contact with
the Brood soldier l told you of.

558
00:53:54,731 --> 00:53:55,789
Can you heal him?

559
00:53:56,800 --> 00:53:58,427
Ah, well, dragon blood will help.

560
00:53:58,768 --> 00:54:04,104
lf fresh, taken in time,
it has been able to counter the poison.

561
00:54:05,275 --> 00:54:06,469
What allows him to draw upon

562
00:54:06,610 --> 00:54:11,604
the Bloodsteel powers of others
may be his undoing.

563
00:54:17,787 --> 00:54:19,448
You should have forseen that.

564
00:54:20,857 --> 00:54:24,054
Your mind is cluttered. Distracted.

565
00:54:25,996 --> 00:54:28,556
That's when we are most vulnerable.

566
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:34,396
l'm sorry. l have to force myself
to look ahead.

567
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:42,510
But when l do, all l see is...

568
00:54:46,416 --> 00:54:47,576
darkness.

569
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,184
What?

570
00:54:52,555 --> 00:54:53,419
What is it?

571
00:54:55,792 --> 00:54:57,692
What have you seen
that you have not told me?

572
00:55:03,199 --> 00:55:07,465
l wish l could tell you the darkness
is merely an illusion my child.

573
00:55:08,505 --> 00:55:15,035
But, l cannot. The truth is,
you must prepare yourself.

574
00:55:17,981 --> 00:55:21,212
You have seen my death?

575
00:55:22,185 --> 00:55:23,015
Yes.

576
00:55:29,225 --> 00:55:31,853
When? How?

577
00:55:33,463 --> 00:55:39,993
That chapter is yet unwritten.
How and when remains your choice.

578
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:54,673
lf the fate of Mirabilis hangs
in the balance then l have no choice.

579
00:55:56,052 --> 00:55:57,280
Do any of us?

580
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:01,749
Everyone dies Perfidia.

581
00:56:03,827 --> 00:56:07,354
You have given the better part
of your life to the people

582
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:10,963
at great cost to your happiness.

583
00:56:13,470 --> 00:56:15,062
That was my choice.

584
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:20,172
Was it? l armed you with knowledge.

585
00:56:21,544 --> 00:56:23,739
All the skill you'll need to survive.

586
00:56:23,880 --> 00:56:26,610
But it cannot change what is foretold.

587
00:56:27,851 --> 00:56:28,749
No.

588
00:56:30,286 --> 00:56:33,653
l can only tell you
that the time of the reckoning

589
00:56:34,657 --> 00:56:36,955
will be of your own choosing.

590
00:56:41,097 --> 00:56:47,229
And you must face it willingly.

591
00:56:53,843 --> 00:56:55,333
l don't know if l can.

592
00:57:06,456 --> 00:57:08,515
You don't have to undertake this.

593
00:57:11,795 --> 00:57:13,228
You can say no.

594
00:57:17,033 --> 00:57:20,434
No, grandfather. l cannot.

595
00:57:53,670 --> 00:57:55,695
This is absolute madness.

596
00:57:56,005 --> 00:57:58,872
This motley group taking
on the entire Brood?

597
00:57:59,008 --> 00:58:00,168
We'll need to be armed to the teeth.

598
00:58:00,276 --> 00:58:04,610
l'll say that.
Blacksmith, this blade's no good.

599
00:58:04,948 --> 00:58:06,643
l just sold you this one hunter.

600
00:58:06,816 --> 00:58:09,512
And l just told you the blade is cheap.
The metal is no good.

601
00:58:09,619 --> 00:58:11,849
These are the finest swords
in Mirabilis.

602
00:58:11,988 --> 00:58:12,955
Yeah, so you say.

603
00:58:13,089 --> 00:58:15,353
Sword is only as good as the swordsman.

604
00:58:18,795 --> 00:58:20,456
Let me handle this. Come.

605
00:58:20,630 --> 00:58:21,255
That's good.

606
00:58:21,397 --> 00:58:23,160
You brought the...you know?

607
00:58:23,433 --> 00:58:24,422
As promised.

608
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:33,171
And you vow this
will beguile any maiden?

609
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:35,706
You've seen me work my love craft.

610
00:58:36,513 --> 00:58:39,414
Yes, but you so young and handsome
and l'm less so.

611
00:58:44,087 --> 00:58:45,486
Looks painful.

612
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:47,120
lt's worth it.

613
00:58:48,057 --> 00:58:51,390
Besides, l'd shutter
your windows or word of your prowess

614
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:53,462
will spread through
the Keep like wildfire.

615
00:58:57,300 --> 00:58:58,096
All right.

616
00:59:05,008 --> 00:59:07,135
Any news on the whereabouts
of Swope and his men?

617
00:59:07,610 --> 00:59:08,770
l mean, look at that.

618
00:59:12,582 --> 00:59:15,415
The Keep here.
The Savage Lands here.

619
00:59:15,919 --> 00:59:18,854
Most of their attacks
are along this corridor.

620
00:59:19,055 --> 00:59:21,023
Along the caravans
and the trading routes.

621
00:59:21,724 --> 00:59:23,954
Word has it they are after something.

622
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:27,053
And the weapons promised?

623
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:29,154
l have the regular Bolts.

624
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:35,994
l can give you genuine Bloodsteel bolts.
Heart-seeking.

625
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:40,168
Properly aimed they will zero in
on the beating heart of any foe.

626
00:59:43,279 --> 00:59:46,077
Oh. And the crossbows.

627
00:59:48,518 --> 00:59:51,919
l'll take them all.
Yes. And that one.

628
00:59:52,722 --> 00:59:53,450
Here.

629
00:59:54,324 --> 00:59:55,916
And this.

630
00:59:58,361 --> 00:59:59,658
Nice doing business with you.

631
01:00:02,498 --> 01:00:04,864
You'll be amused to know
the Triune has listed

632
01:00:05,001 --> 01:00:09,563
John Serragoth among others
in their so-called Order

633
01:00:09,706 --> 01:00:11,469
of the Knights of Mirabilis.

634
01:00:13,476 --> 01:00:16,502
Correct me if l'm wrong,
Lord Splayven,

635
01:00:17,013 --> 01:00:19,311
but weren't these knights
the very four who routed you

636
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:21,383
and your men at the Crossroads?

637
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:23,850
lt will not happen again.

638
01:00:24,087 --> 01:00:29,320
Perhaps humility would be a
more appropriate response then mockery.

639
01:00:30,126 --> 01:00:33,391
l am always humble in your company,
Dragon Eye.

640
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:38,061
l have teams strategically placed
throughout the Savage Lands.

641
01:00:38,935 --> 01:00:42,564
lf these knights
are close we'll know it.

642
01:00:42,705 --> 01:00:45,333
Perfidia Aerie is
the granddaughter of Tesselink.

643
01:00:45,475 --> 01:00:47,739
Tesselink is a relic.

644
01:00:47,844 --> 01:00:50,711
Dismiss a sorcerer
at your own peril.

645
01:00:51,614 --> 01:00:55,914
On the other hand,
no one is immortal...

646
01:00:59,589 --> 01:01:00,681
...yet.

647
01:01:12,435 --> 01:01:16,132
Very clever, sire.
Making Orion's bar maid your weapon.

648
01:02:03,886 --> 01:02:06,616
Are you sure your black market friends
know what they're talking about?

649
01:02:07,690 --> 01:02:09,157
They trade with these caravans.

650
01:02:09,892 --> 01:02:12,019
lf Swope went this way
they'd know about it.

651
01:02:12,562 --> 01:02:17,898
Besides, given the risk l can't believe
we're not getting paid for this.

652
01:02:18,034 --> 01:02:20,628
l'm sure you'll get
what's coming to you.

653
01:02:21,404 --> 01:02:25,067
You know, l can't help but think
there's a bit of fate in our,

654
01:02:25,208 --> 01:02:28,143
you know, working side by side.

655
01:02:28,878 --> 01:02:29,845
Fate?

656
01:02:30,713 --> 01:02:33,011
As much as l've admired you
from afar l must say the view

657
01:02:33,149 --> 01:02:36,312
from here is breathtaking.

658
01:02:37,120 --> 01:02:40,749
Do you seriously think
that a flirtation that works

659
01:02:40,890 --> 01:02:43,381
with the milk maid
is going to work on me?

660
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:47,496
l'm a helpless conscript
in the army of the smitten.

661
01:02:48,164 --> 01:02:49,722
At ease, soldier.

662
01:02:49,899 --> 01:02:53,335
l can understand your reluctance.
l'm human, you're elven.

663
01:02:53,469 --> 01:02:56,495
But, that doesn't have to stand
in the way.

664
01:02:58,007 --> 01:03:00,635
Adric, please don't take offense.

665
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:05,308
But, to me you have all the charm
of a sucking chest wound.

666
01:03:06,516 --> 01:03:09,349
Ah. So, take it slow.

667
01:03:24,133 --> 01:03:26,328
My family...

668
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:29,736
they killed everyone.

669
01:03:31,774 --> 01:03:35,972
They were Brood.
They tore my clothes.

670
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:38,246
Swopes men did this.

671
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:42,476
Aye, that means he's close.

672
01:04:26,262 --> 01:04:28,253
My scouts tell me five dead.

673
01:04:28,965 --> 01:04:30,626
And they're certain it was Swope's men?

674
01:04:31,000 --> 01:04:33,400
Well, the good news is
that it means the knights are not there.

675
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:36,069
Leave it to you, Malcolm,
to find the good in a massacre.

676
01:04:37,306 --> 01:04:39,331
Maybe we can use the knights as bait.

677
01:04:40,176 --> 01:04:44,909
l will remind you,
Perfidia is my granddaughter.

678
01:04:45,047 --> 01:04:46,844
Well, then l'd remind you Tesselink

679
01:04:47,016 --> 01:04:48,347
that you were the one
who put her name forth.

680
01:04:48,484 --> 01:04:52,079
My hand was guided by an Oracle.

681
01:04:52,722 --> 01:04:57,022
Well then, you can blame the Oracle
should anything tragic happen to her.

682
01:05:03,733 --> 01:05:07,396
l don't recommend you second guess him.

683
01:05:10,106 --> 01:05:11,368
lf you believe that...

684
01:06:19,875 --> 01:06:21,570
An assassin's claw.

685
01:06:24,647 --> 01:06:28,674
This, this is Dragon Eye's doing.

686
01:06:29,618 --> 01:06:34,317
He's determined to eliminate any
obstacles in his quest for the Crucible.

687
01:06:34,957 --> 01:06:37,187
For all we know,
he may already have it.

688
01:06:37,526 --> 01:06:39,926
No, l would have heard something.

689
01:06:41,430 --> 01:06:44,661
Yes, yes of course.

690
01:06:45,735 --> 01:06:47,726
Your embedded source.

691
01:06:47,870 --> 01:06:49,531
lt's helped us more than you know.

692
01:06:50,139 --> 01:06:53,040
But, you still can't possibly reveal
his identity?

693
01:06:53,175 --> 01:06:54,199
Even after this.

694
01:06:54,343 --> 01:06:56,573
l'm doing what l have to
to protect the Keep.

695
01:06:56,912 --> 01:06:58,573
Just going to have to take my word.

696
01:07:45,294 --> 01:07:47,558
They took what little Bloodsteel we had.

697
01:07:48,597 --> 01:07:49,723
And they killed my brother.

698
01:07:53,536 --> 01:07:54,594
For nothing.

699
01:07:55,971 --> 01:07:57,404
But, they couldn't kill me.

700
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:02,406
You should rest.

701
01:08:04,513 --> 01:08:05,480
l didn't get your name.

702
01:08:07,316 --> 01:08:10,808
Adric. l, l didn't get yours.

703
01:08:12,688 --> 01:08:13,518
Maya.

704
01:08:15,724 --> 01:08:16,452
Maya.

705
01:08:18,561 --> 01:08:21,997
l found tracks.
Probably Swope and his men.

706
01:08:22,298 --> 01:08:25,324
They're headed up stream.
They're fresh. We should leave now.

707
01:08:27,870 --> 01:08:28,734
What ails him?

708
01:08:30,239 --> 01:08:32,298
He held the phantom warrior
at the hanging.

709
01:08:33,275 --> 01:08:37,143
He took on his powers.
l have seen such things.

710
01:08:37,780 --> 01:08:41,307
He seems himself yet his spirit wanes.

711
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:46,210
My spirit still remains mine.

712
01:08:47,523 --> 01:08:49,184
A few moments rest.

713
01:08:53,028 --> 01:08:58,330
Besides, this skill l've taken on...

714
01:08:58,434 --> 01:08:59,662
You mean the affliction.

715
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:15,343
l can learn how to control it.

716
01:09:20,156 --> 01:09:21,783
l can control it.

717
01:09:24,059 --> 01:09:25,253
This might be useful.

718
01:09:52,721 --> 01:09:53,653
She cannot come.

719
01:09:53,789 --> 01:09:56,451
Maya, it's too dangerous.
You need to go back to Black Roc.

720
01:09:56,592 --> 01:10:00,551
You think me weak? l have travelled
these trading routes all my life.

721
01:10:00,729 --> 01:10:03,857
l know how to hide.
l want my revenge.

722
01:10:03,999 --> 01:10:06,297
Wait. Maya. You don't understand.
We...

723
01:10:06,435 --> 01:10:08,835
Or, are you going to make me go, Elf?

724
01:10:08,904 --> 01:10:10,269
l only think of your safety.

725
01:10:10,406 --> 01:10:12,670
My safety is none of your concern.

726
01:10:12,808 --> 01:10:14,935
Ladies, ladies, we don't need
to be so upset about this.

727
01:10:15,077 --> 01:10:16,510
Maya, you'll have to understand that...

728
01:10:18,814 --> 01:10:20,714
Listen, you don't want to get
in the middle of this.

729
01:10:21,383 --> 01:10:24,284
Elven and human women don't get along,
ever.

730
01:10:24,687 --> 01:10:28,214
Fine. But, hear this,
l'm not going to let the Brood,

731
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:33,317
the elves, the goblins or anyone
else run my life, especially her.

732
01:10:38,534 --> 01:10:39,933
Maya, wait.

733
01:10:41,136 --> 01:10:44,128
Take these just in case.

734
01:10:45,174 --> 01:10:49,975
Well, my good knight.
Return in one piece.

735
01:10:53,515 --> 01:10:54,345
Women.

736
01:10:57,386 --> 01:11:01,948
The map to the Crucible
is within our reach.

737
01:11:04,193 --> 01:11:08,527
According to the Oracle
we have 'til the alignment

738
01:11:08,864 --> 01:11:10,627
to trigger the Crucible's power.

739
01:11:12,468 --> 01:11:17,030
Then we'll have all
the riches we ever dreamed of.

740
01:11:19,008 --> 01:11:23,945
More than Dragon Eye himself.

741
01:11:24,079 --> 01:11:28,015
l'll never answer to that monster again.

742
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:30,209
Yes. He's right. Yes.

743
01:11:30,352 --> 01:11:37,417
Drink up, my friends.
To me, the new Magus of Mirabilis!

744
01:11:42,564 --> 01:11:46,330
All that stands in our way is a dragon.

745
01:11:46,902 --> 01:11:47,766
Drink to it!

746
01:11:48,504 --> 01:11:53,441
But, the Oracle warned
we've never seen the likes of it.

747
01:11:59,848 --> 01:12:00,678
To the dragon!

748
01:12:01,950 --> 01:12:02,848
And to Swope!

749
01:12:05,854 --> 01:12:07,287
This is my time

750
01:12:16,332 --> 01:12:17,458
lt is time now.

751
01:12:22,604 --> 01:12:23,298
Ber-Lak.

752
01:12:26,608 --> 01:12:27,267
Ber-Lak.

753
01:12:34,550 --> 01:12:35,414
To the Crucible!

754
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:55,268
Putting a curse on Maya
or looking into the future?

755
01:12:56,438 --> 01:12:57,837
Or perhaps the past.

756
01:12:59,108 --> 01:13:00,632
Yeah, what do you see?

757
01:13:03,846 --> 01:13:07,441
Maya, when we found her.

758
01:13:09,785 --> 01:13:11,218
lt made you remember something.

759
01:13:12,955 --> 01:13:16,254
Aye. That the gods failed
when they made mortals.

760
01:13:18,627 --> 01:13:20,458
l don't believe you're an assassin.

761
01:13:22,398 --> 01:13:24,889
Well, tell that to the men
l've assassinated.

762
01:13:25,768 --> 01:13:31,001
Asssassins kill for hire or out
of misguided zealotry.

763
01:13:32,808 --> 01:13:37,677
When we first met l asked you
what Azenhawke did to you.

764
01:13:37,813 --> 01:13:38,711
l answered.

765
01:13:38,814 --> 01:13:41,908
No John, you didn't.

766
01:13:52,494 --> 01:13:53,426
l'm not, uh,

767
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,059
l'm not from these parts,

768
01:14:01,804 --> 01:14:03,362
as you might have guessed.

769
01:14:05,073 --> 01:14:07,667
l come from the unsettled territory,
the Moorlands.

770
01:14:13,882 --> 01:14:15,349
Our numbers are few.

771
01:14:16,718 --> 01:14:19,278
We hunted and lived from the land.

772
01:14:20,155 --> 01:14:21,713
That is until they came.

773
01:14:24,526 --> 01:14:26,858
And, what happened?

774
01:14:28,897 --> 01:14:32,389
They demanded our knowledge
and the whereabouts

775
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:37,631
of this mythic mind of endless stone,
Bloodsteel.

776
01:14:38,540 --> 01:14:43,705
Well, we told them it was nonsense.
No such place exists.

777
01:14:44,279 --> 01:14:49,410
That their time was wasted.
And they wasted no time.

778
01:14:56,325 --> 01:14:57,724
She was with child.

779
01:15:06,401 --> 01:15:11,429
l never got to hold him in my hands.

780
01:15:14,042 --> 01:15:16,135
To teach him the ways of life.

781
01:15:20,582 --> 01:15:22,072
To watch him stumble.

782
01:15:23,085 --> 01:15:24,143
To pick him up.

783
01:15:27,789 --> 01:15:29,723
To show him right from wrong.

784
01:15:31,393 --> 01:15:32,655
l'm so sorry.

785
01:15:33,896 --> 01:15:37,491
They counted twenty-one.
We never stood a chance.

786
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:39,893
There were too many.

787
01:15:42,104 --> 01:15:44,572
Three died, however,
by my sword that day.

788
01:15:46,008 --> 01:15:47,532
l was left for dead.

789
01:15:49,344 --> 01:15:53,337
Since then, l have tracked eight
including Azenhawke.

790
01:15:54,616 --> 01:16:00,384
Four others have died in battles
or have been executed but six remain.

791
01:16:01,089 --> 01:16:03,455
And, so you swore revenge.

792
01:16:06,094 --> 01:16:10,360
You will never be satisfied
until you've accounted for the rest.

793
01:16:12,501 --> 01:16:13,661
Well, now you know.

794
01:16:14,736 --> 01:16:17,705
Well, maybe it would have been better
if you were an assassin.

795
01:16:18,674 --> 01:16:22,007
They say that when a man seeks
to cure his own pain

796
01:16:22,144 --> 01:16:25,113
with the pain of others
that it's a bottomless vortex.

797
01:16:25,247 --> 01:16:29,149
All this Bloodsteel and magic,
it's a curse upon this world.

798
01:16:30,052 --> 01:16:34,045
Well, what will happen the first time
my mission conflicts with your vendetta?

799
01:16:34,423 --> 01:16:37,449
l don't know. l guess we'll both
just have to wait and see.

800
01:17:05,554 --> 01:17:07,351
Ber-Lak! Adric!

801
01:17:11,693 --> 01:17:12,625
l found them.

802
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:15,319
Good going. Did they see you?

803
01:17:16,798 --> 01:17:18,459
l couldn't even see myself.

804
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:20,429
Well done, friend.

805
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:27,571
Swope seeks the map
at the caves of the Malapi.

806
01:17:27,676 --> 01:17:29,974
The waterfall. That's at headwaters.

807
01:17:33,615 --> 01:17:35,947
l learned of a warning from the Oracle.

808
01:17:36,351 --> 01:17:38,046
The Crucible exists.

809
01:17:38,420 --> 01:17:41,787
But, we have to find the map
before the alignment.

810
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:50,088
Another thing, it is guarded by
a dragon the likes no one has seen.

811
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:52,391
What does that mean?

812
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:55,693
l can't imagine.
l've seen all types.

813
01:17:56,471 --> 01:17:59,338
You know, maybe we should let Swope
take the lead on this.

814
01:18:00,142 --> 01:18:01,734
With any luck,
maybe the dragon has spent

815
01:18:01,877 --> 01:18:03,777
most of his fire on him and his men.

816
01:18:03,945 --> 01:18:05,242
Well, they'll wish it had.

817
01:18:32,908 --> 01:18:33,932
lnto the forest.

818
01:18:46,188 --> 01:18:50,284
John. Are we agreed
on the task at hand?

819
01:18:51,093 --> 01:18:53,027
l know Swope is on your list.

820
01:18:54,262 --> 01:18:57,288
Do l want Swope dead? Aye.

821
01:18:57,799 --> 01:18:59,596
Will l bide my time?

822
01:19:01,303 --> 01:19:02,395
Unfortunately.

823
01:19:02,537 --> 01:19:04,198
ls that the best you can do?

824
01:19:05,240 --> 01:19:06,537
Yeah, that's the best l can do.

825
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:38,172
lt's lair must be around here.

826
01:19:38,907 --> 01:19:43,503
Look. That's it. The waterfall.

827
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:47,442
So, that's it's home, huh?

828
01:19:47,983 --> 01:19:49,450
Nobody home l hope.

829
01:20:09,671 --> 01:20:11,468
Run! Run!

830
01:20:11,606 --> 01:20:13,164
Where's he?

831
01:20:15,076 --> 01:20:17,135
lt's invisible! l can't see it!

832
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:19,137
lt's invisible!

833
01:20:26,922 --> 01:20:29,482
l can't see it! l can't see it!

834
01:20:54,149 --> 01:20:56,413
Run! Run!

835
01:21:34,956 --> 01:21:35,513
Look!

836
01:21:39,728 --> 01:21:40,422
What is that!?!

837
01:21:40,695 --> 01:21:43,960
That's it. lt becomes visible
when it breathes fire.

838
01:21:44,633 --> 01:21:46,794
We will just have seconds to take aim.

839
01:21:49,771 --> 01:21:51,102
Steady.

840
01:21:51,239 --> 01:21:51,967
Loose!

841
01:21:59,547 --> 01:22:00,206
Damn it!

842
01:22:00,382 --> 01:22:03,283
You missed!
l thought you could fire a crossbow!

843
01:22:03,418 --> 01:22:05,249
Well, if l could see the stupid thing!

844
01:22:05,553 --> 01:22:08,886
Use this. Bloodsteel will find
the heart even if you can't.

845
01:22:09,858 --> 01:22:14,795
Listen to me. When it comes in
for the kill and takes a deep breath.

846
01:22:14,930 --> 01:22:17,091
Aye, and it's rib cage expands.

847
01:22:17,399 --> 01:22:19,128
lt gives us more of a target.

848
01:22:22,537 --> 01:22:24,402
So, any last words?

849
01:22:24,673 --> 01:22:28,632
lf l don't survive this
l want you to know one thing.

850
01:22:30,111 --> 01:22:35,242
That if l slay this beast you've
enraged you'll offer your lips.

851
01:22:36,818 --> 01:22:38,285
Your life for a kiss.

852
01:22:40,622 --> 01:22:42,419
lf that would steady your hand.

853
01:22:44,693 --> 01:22:45,660
There it is!

854
01:22:49,030 --> 01:22:50,258
l can see it.

855
01:22:55,704 --> 01:22:56,728
To the right!

856
01:22:58,840 --> 01:22:59,534
To the right.

857
01:23:07,916 --> 01:23:09,213
Steady.

858
01:23:09,985 --> 01:23:10,917
Steady.

859
01:23:14,456 --> 01:23:15,423
Loose!

860
01:23:30,205 --> 01:23:31,137
Thank the gods!

861
01:23:33,742 --> 01:23:37,075
Do you still doubt the power
of Bloodsteel?

862
01:23:37,512 --> 01:23:41,448
l didn't use the Bloodsteel arrow.
l used my own.

863
01:23:42,384 --> 01:23:44,079
l figured it was the least l could do.

864
01:23:45,353 --> 01:23:47,685
l don't take joy
in the killing of dragons.

865
01:23:50,658 --> 01:23:53,786
lt's all right Ber-Lak.
Don't try and move.

866
01:23:54,262 --> 01:23:55,229
l'm all right.

867
01:23:56,064 --> 01:24:00,660
Adric, find the dragon's body
and collect some blood.

868
01:24:01,436 --> 01:24:03,097
We'll be back shortly.

869
01:24:08,443 --> 01:24:09,467
ls this fire-proof?

870
01:24:32,100 --> 01:24:36,093
You know, l've been thinking
a lot about our little deal.

871
01:24:37,739 --> 01:24:38,865
Which deal?

872
01:24:40,909 --> 01:24:41,705
The kiss.

873
01:24:44,379 --> 01:24:48,315
Oh. l was only trying to humor you.

874
01:24:49,617 --> 01:24:50,641
Nothing more.

875
01:24:52,220 --> 01:24:53,187
Nothing more?

876
01:24:54,255 --> 01:24:55,779
Nothing more.

877
01:25:14,909 --> 01:25:18,606
Well, it appears we're not
the first visitors here.

878
01:25:36,331 --> 01:25:37,389
Help me with this.

879
01:26:06,127 --> 01:26:07,355
There's something inside.

880
01:26:22,377 --> 01:26:24,004
That's not the Crucible, is it?

881
01:26:24,245 --> 01:26:26,645
No, but a map that leads us there.

882
01:26:26,881 --> 01:26:27,779
lndeed, it is.

883
01:26:28,616 --> 01:26:33,280
l wouldn't do that.
Just as the Oracle described it.

884
01:26:33,488 --> 01:26:37,288
l can't tell you the trouble
the two of you have saved me.

885
01:26:37,992 --> 01:26:40,756
lt figures the apprentice
of a sorcerer

886
01:26:40,895 --> 01:26:43,363
would have a better shot slaying
that beast.

887
01:26:46,634 --> 01:26:47,396
Drop the sword.

888
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:49,227
Or you die.

889
01:26:49,737 --> 01:26:53,104
Drop your sword or my men
will kill the human dog.

890
01:26:53,241 --> 01:26:54,333
She will die.

891
01:26:59,113 --> 01:26:59,875
Drop it!

892
01:27:03,151 --> 01:27:03,879
No!

893
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:08,385
And now your turn.
Drop your sword. Do it!

894
01:27:11,626 --> 01:27:13,059
l promise you this, Swope.

895
01:27:13,528 --> 01:27:15,325
You will not walk away
from our next meeting.

896
01:27:15,463 --> 01:27:22,301
You won't be walking at all.
That l promise. l'll take that.

897
01:27:26,207 --> 01:27:29,005
l'll see the two of you in hell.

898
01:27:51,799 --> 01:27:54,165
Three hundred years
after the free peoples

899
01:27:54,302 --> 01:27:57,135
of Mirabilis defeated
the tyrant Magus...

900
01:27:57,972 --> 01:27:59,997
ln a war over Bloodsteel.

901
01:28:01,843 --> 01:28:05,040
Reserves of the enchanted
metal were all but gone.

902
01:28:06,147 --> 01:28:08,672
Hope turned
to finding the Crucible.

903
01:28:08,983 --> 01:28:11,975
The steels legendary
inexhaustible source.

904
01:28:12,887 --> 01:28:15,913
Only one knew were the Magus
had hidden the Crucible.

905
01:28:16,457 --> 01:28:18,288
The Oracle of Mirabilis.

906
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:21,357
And, he was loathe
to share the secret fearing

907
01:28:21,496 --> 01:28:24,056
its power would
turn good men bad

908
01:28:24,666 --> 01:28:28,295
and drive evil to
untold depths of depravity.

909
01:28:29,237 --> 01:28:31,933
Dragon Eye, heir to the
throne of Magus,

910
01:28:32,173 --> 01:28:35,074
had strong reason to get
to the Crucible first.

911
01:28:35,576 --> 01:28:38,101
To regain absolute dominion
over Mirabilis

912
01:28:38,246 --> 01:28:43,047
and undo the curse of endless sleep
that gripped his own beloved son.

913
01:28:47,455 --> 01:28:51,789
And the only thing in his way,
four less than eager,

914
01:28:52,026 --> 01:28:54,586
less than accomplished
champions of justice.

915
01:28:55,196 --> 01:28:57,721
The newly dubbed Knights
of Bloodsteel.

916
01:28:58,066 --> 01:29:01,194
With a clear mission,
find the Crucible,

917
01:29:01,736 --> 01:29:05,695
defeat the Brood
and save Mirabilis.

918
01:29:20,922 --> 01:29:21,650
Loose!

919
01:30:15,309 --> 01:30:16,367
Ber-Lak.

920
01:30:17,812 --> 01:30:19,177
We can't waste time.

921
01:30:19,747 --> 01:30:20,372
Right.

922
01:30:27,255 --> 01:30:32,420
And a moon filled my shadow.
My heart yearns to rest.

923
01:30:34,095 --> 01:30:40,056
Where neither power nor fear rule
my soul at it's best.

924
01:30:42,770 --> 01:30:49,505
Oh sacred darkness take my mind
and leave me to thee

925
01:30:50,478 --> 01:30:57,782
where until eternity l shall labor
until goblin-kind be set free.

926
01:31:01,689 --> 01:31:03,623
What happened?
l heard the explosion.

927
01:31:03,758 --> 01:31:05,726
We'll explain later.
Did you get the dragon blood?

928
01:31:05,860 --> 01:31:07,521
l did.
Ber-Lak is fading.

929
01:31:07,662 --> 01:31:09,789
Hurry.
He must take the blood before it rots.

930
01:31:12,733 --> 01:31:13,665
Any improvements?

931
01:31:14,135 --> 01:31:17,070
He's still breathing.
Beyond that.

932
01:31:19,640 --> 01:31:23,041
Every minute wasted here puts more
distance between us and Swope.

933
01:31:23,177 --> 01:31:26,112
We can't leave a fellow
knight out here to die.

934
01:31:26,314 --> 01:31:28,145
So, Swope believes
you've died?

935
01:31:29,450 --> 01:31:30,940
Aye, it stands to reason.

936
01:31:33,187 --> 01:31:37,021
Well, that can work for our advantage.
lf we can find him again.

937
01:31:37,158 --> 01:31:38,853
Chances are
his guard will be down.

938
01:31:39,327 --> 01:31:41,227
That remains
a very significant if.

939
01:31:41,362 --> 01:31:43,592
Take another sip Ber-Lak.

940
01:31:58,279 --> 01:32:01,612
Smells good.
What is it?

941
01:32:06,220 --> 01:32:07,152
Filet of dragon.

942
01:32:07,622 --> 01:32:08,316
Here.

943
01:32:09,524 --> 01:32:10,718
Welcome back, brother.

944
01:33:34,609 --> 01:33:37,544
Dragon Eye sends his regards.

945
01:33:37,778 --> 01:33:44,047
You have won nothing.
Perfidia.

946
01:33:55,930 --> 01:33:56,658
What's wrong?

947
01:33:58,132 --> 01:33:58,962
l don't know.

948
01:34:00,267 --> 01:34:03,600
This terrible darkness
just came over me.

949
01:34:12,580 --> 01:34:19,543
My son, Swope will find the source
and then l shall pluck the prize.

950
01:34:22,857 --> 01:34:27,260
l promised l would make
everything right again my son.

951
01:34:34,669 --> 01:34:39,697
As my father wished, as l wish,

952
01:34:40,474 --> 01:34:43,238
you will not be cursed as l have been.

953
01:34:44,045 --> 01:34:48,414
And soon l will awaken
you to a new world.

954
01:34:48,916 --> 01:34:50,781
This l vow!

955
01:34:57,558 --> 01:34:58,422
Look at him!

956
01:35:01,128 --> 01:35:06,088
Behold the body
of the great sorcerer Tesselink.

957
01:35:07,702 --> 01:35:12,401
Show your respects.
You will not see his like again.

958
01:35:15,443 --> 01:35:17,172
The great sorcerer Tesselink.

959
01:35:19,714 --> 01:35:23,115
You will not see him again
until the great after.

960
01:35:31,125 --> 01:35:35,619
My friend, Dragon Eye will not go
unpunished for this cowardly act.

961
01:35:38,099 --> 01:35:40,624
We must act with force and as one.

962
01:35:44,872 --> 01:35:48,103
The assassination
of a Triune member.

963
01:35:49,577 --> 01:35:51,909
lt doesn't get much
more brazen than that!

964
01:35:52,113 --> 01:35:55,549
This time they made sure his magic
could not heal his wounds.

965
01:35:56,417 --> 01:35:58,078
l'm assigning guards
for each of you.

966
01:35:59,453 --> 01:36:03,981
lf they can get to Tesselink then
any of us are at peril.

967
01:36:04,325 --> 01:36:05,917
And what of Swope's cadre?

968
01:36:06,193 --> 01:36:07,888
Have the knights managed
to intercept them?

969
01:36:08,229 --> 01:36:09,856
Reports say that Swope
and his men continue

970
01:36:09,997 --> 01:36:11,021
to decimate the countryside

971
01:36:11,165 --> 01:36:14,430
in their search for
this Crucible and Savage Lands.

972
01:36:14,668 --> 01:36:16,431
So, they've hardly
been neutralized?

973
01:36:16,570 --> 01:36:21,234
No. My sources tell me
that their looking for

974
01:36:21,375 --> 01:36:24,674
a translator
of the ancient language.

975
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:28,776
Perhaps it has something
to do with the Crucible.

976
01:36:30,417 --> 01:36:31,441
Perhaps.

977
01:36:58,445 --> 01:36:59,707
Do we trust him?

978
01:37:04,885 --> 01:37:06,318
Do we trust anyone?

979
01:37:07,988 --> 01:37:09,649
These are definitely
Swope's tracks.

980
01:37:09,790 --> 01:37:10,586
You're certain?

981
01:37:11,292 --> 01:37:13,453
l would've thought the word
definitely might have conveyed that.

982
01:37:13,594 --> 01:37:16,722
lt's just that their progress seems
aimless in this barren place.

983
01:37:23,304 --> 01:37:24,100
They've been this way.

984
01:37:37,751 --> 01:37:38,581
What is this place?

985
01:37:39,386 --> 01:37:42,617
A mining commune of the old world.
Looks abandoned...

986
01:37:43,123 --> 01:37:43,680
Take cover!

987
01:37:43,824 --> 01:37:45,257
Wait! Wait!

988
01:37:45,392 --> 01:37:46,290
Perfidia, get down!

989
01:37:46,393 --> 01:37:48,884
Who dares to step on our land!?!

990
01:37:49,029 --> 01:37:51,327
You always shoot first
and ask later!?!

991
01:37:51,432 --> 01:37:54,265
Don't get smart
with me ya Brood low-life.

992
01:37:54,435 --> 01:37:55,993
We are not Brood!

993
01:37:56,136 --> 01:37:57,228
How do l know that?

994
01:37:57,304 --> 01:38:00,330
Because we haven't killed you!
Yet.

995
01:38:00,474 --> 01:38:04,934
Heh. That was just a warning shot.
l aimed six feet above your head.

996
01:38:05,079 --> 01:38:07,775
You damn near killed me!
What, are you blind!?!

997
01:38:07,882 --> 01:38:10,874
Well, yes, in point of fact.
l am!

998
01:38:13,220 --> 01:38:14,016
Oh, he's really blind.

999
01:38:14,121 --> 01:38:17,852
Weren't for these Bloodsteel lenses
l couldn't see the little l do.

1000
01:38:18,826 --> 01:38:21,761
Hurry!
Get in before they come back!

1001
01:38:22,363 --> 01:38:23,489
Run!

1002
01:38:28,569 --> 01:38:29,934
Read me these words!

1003
01:38:30,504 --> 01:38:34,702
l, l don't know the old words.
Brother Klegg translates.

1004
01:38:34,842 --> 01:38:35,501
What!?!

1005
01:38:35,843 --> 01:38:39,176
Klegg! Klegg translates!

1006
01:38:43,117 --> 01:38:46,985
Now, which one is Brother Klegg?

1007
01:38:48,322 --> 01:38:49,380
Answer me!

1008
01:38:51,792 --> 01:38:57,094
This time we burn that garbage
pit to the ground! Follow me!

1009
01:38:58,832 --> 01:39:00,129
We're under siege.

1010
01:39:00,334 --> 01:39:01,926
This morning
a whole band of them came

1011
01:39:02,069 --> 01:39:04,469
and raided
what little Bloodsteel we had.

1012
01:39:04,972 --> 01:39:08,601
They took Brother Grell.
Please tell me he lives.

1013
01:39:08,676 --> 01:39:11,543
We've seen no one.
And who are you?

1014
01:39:11,812 --> 01:39:12,801
Brother Klegg.

1015
01:39:12,913 --> 01:39:17,976
Amazing. l've heard tales that
Bloodsteel gives sight to the blind,

1016
01:39:18,118 --> 01:39:19,244
but nothing like this.

1017
01:39:19,386 --> 01:39:20,876
The wizard that sold them
to me promised

1018
01:39:21,021 --> 01:39:23,546
l could should shoot a gnat
off a dragon's tail.

1019
01:39:23,791 --> 01:39:24,917
What brings you here?

1020
01:39:25,559 --> 01:39:28,528
We are knights ordained
by the Triune.

1021
01:39:28,662 --> 01:39:33,099
Knights of the Triune!
This is all there is!

1022
01:39:33,434 --> 01:39:35,231
Where were you this morning?

1023
01:39:35,703 --> 01:39:36,635
What happened?

1024
01:39:36,770 --> 01:39:41,434
Attacked. Almost everyone is gone.
Run off, dead.

1025
01:39:41,575 --> 01:39:44,772
Only a handful left after
the Brood came.

1026
01:39:44,979 --> 01:39:47,675
The Brood?
What can you tell us about them?

1027
01:39:48,115 --> 01:39:52,245
Well, they eat a lot of garlic.
And they call their leader Swope.

1028
01:39:52,353 --> 01:39:55,811
Just point me in the right direction.
l'll take care of Swope.

1029
01:39:55,956 --> 01:39:57,082
Swope, huh?

1030
01:39:57,257 --> 01:39:59,316
Well, that will be
my particular privilege.

1031
01:39:59,460 --> 01:40:01,758
Besides, we don't want you
shooting one of our own.

1032
01:40:02,930 --> 01:40:04,454
l told you my source
is unassailable.

1033
01:40:04,598 --> 01:40:08,694
Fine. And what does this
unassailable source tell you!?

1034
01:40:09,536 --> 01:40:11,663
That Dragon Eye's machinists
are working on a device

1035
01:40:11,805 --> 01:40:14,569
that draws upon
Bloodsteel's most profound power

1036
01:40:15,309 --> 01:40:18,244
and that he intends to use
it to awaken his malformed heir

1037
01:40:18,379 --> 01:40:22,213
to rule over Mirabilis and
to watch over him as a Magus.

1038
01:40:23,350 --> 01:40:25,716
What monstrosity of a child as
one can only imagine.

1039
01:40:26,553 --> 01:40:30,114
His only stumbling block is
the amount of Bloodsteel required.

1040
01:40:30,557 --> 01:40:33,082
One needs a limitless supply.

1041
01:40:33,327 --> 01:40:34,055
Or the Crucible.

1042
01:40:34,194 --> 01:40:37,630
Yes. lf he gets
to it before the knights do

1043
01:40:37,831 --> 01:40:41,028
then Dragon Eye and his
Brood will be invincible.

1044
01:40:45,305 --> 01:40:46,363
Enjoying yourself?

1045
01:40:46,907 --> 01:40:47,635
She's fine.

1046
01:40:48,976 --> 01:40:50,534
She's the new bar maid.

1047
01:40:54,415 --> 01:40:56,110
We need to get
this information to the knights.

1048
01:40:56,683 --> 01:41:00,346
Unfortunately, their whereabouts
are a complete mystery at the moment.

1049
01:41:00,888 --> 01:41:01,855
Not to this.

1050
01:41:04,458 --> 01:41:05,288
l've discovered the purpose of

1051
01:41:05,426 --> 01:41:07,758
the device found
on Tesselink's body.

1052
01:41:08,162 --> 01:41:12,121
This compass contains a twin
to Perfidia's own amulet.

1053
01:41:12,266 --> 01:41:14,063
lt will lead us to her.

1054
01:41:18,639 --> 01:41:20,539
He did say that he would
not send his granddaughter

1055
01:41:20,674 --> 01:41:23,074
into the fires of hell
without the means to find her.

1056
01:41:23,477 --> 01:41:24,739
Then we have no time to lose.

1057
01:41:26,180 --> 01:41:28,808
Tell them to be vigilant
and that Tesselink is dead.

1058
01:41:29,149 --> 01:41:32,448
Trust no one.
Speak only to me. Go. Go now.

1059
01:41:40,661 --> 01:41:44,620
Has anyone said anything
about a map or a scroll?

1060
01:41:45,466 --> 01:41:47,627
As a matter of fact,
they were in need of

1061
01:41:47,768 --> 01:41:49,963
a translator of the old tongue.

1062
01:41:50,270 --> 01:41:51,294
That's why they took Grell.

1063
01:41:51,438 --> 01:41:53,872
They thought he could
translate the old word.

1064
01:41:54,074 --> 01:41:58,977
You are of this order.
Can you speak the old language?

1065
01:42:02,983 --> 01:42:03,745
No.

1066
01:42:04,618 --> 01:42:05,585
No?

1067
01:42:08,388 --> 01:42:09,514
l don't believe you.

1068
01:42:09,923 --> 01:42:11,322
Klegg doesn't lie.

1069
01:42:11,825 --> 01:42:13,690
Neither does my amulet.

1070
01:42:18,298 --> 01:42:23,634
lf you're with them,
so help me, l'll...

1071
01:42:26,106 --> 01:42:27,368
They'll be coming back.

1072
01:42:45,859 --> 01:42:48,851
Klegg! l told you to have your
people reinforce the fences!

1073
01:42:49,096 --> 01:42:51,394
We don't want
to invite more trouble.

1074
01:42:51,532 --> 01:42:52,499
What do you think this is?

1075
01:42:52,633 --> 01:42:54,191
Some of us feel that at least
we still have our lives.

1076
01:42:54,334 --> 01:42:55,699
Why should we put
that at risk?

1077
01:42:55,969 --> 01:42:56,663
And when they've broken down

1078
01:42:56,803 --> 01:42:59,067
the fences are you
so certain you'll be spared?

1079
01:42:59,206 --> 01:43:00,696
What if our best
hope is in appeasement?

1080
01:43:00,841 --> 01:43:02,809
Look, you can't feed
a wild beast raw meat

1081
01:43:02,943 --> 01:43:05,241
and not expect it to
view you as it's next dinner.

1082
01:43:14,221 --> 01:43:18,055
Citizens, miners,
free men and women

1083
01:43:18,192 --> 01:43:20,956
and followers of the old word,
hear me now!

1084
01:43:22,029 --> 01:43:25,897
Your legends of Mirabilis
tell of how the skies opened

1085
01:43:26,033 --> 01:43:29,628
and gave forth Bloodsteel
as a gift from the gods.

1086
01:43:30,571 --> 01:43:34,371
For years, you have worked
these mines until your fingers bled

1087
01:43:34,508 --> 01:43:37,807
but just as your moment
of revelation nears you are faced

1088
01:43:37,945 --> 01:43:41,642
with brigands no better than animals
who would take this away from you!

1089
01:43:41,782 --> 01:43:43,716
Yes. Yes.

1090
01:43:44,318 --> 01:43:47,310
They have no regard
for life or liberty.

1091
01:43:47,421 --> 01:43:50,788
And what are we if we let the
Brood make a mockery of our lives?

1092
01:43:50,924 --> 01:43:52,721
No, l say! Never!

1093
01:43:53,293 --> 01:43:56,956
Fight now and you will have
made a powerful statement!

1094
01:43:57,397 --> 01:43:58,557
There're children here.

1095
01:44:00,968 --> 01:44:03,095
Yes, children. Children.

1096
01:44:03,203 --> 01:44:06,195
Children who need a world
safe enough to grow up in.

1097
01:44:07,774 --> 01:44:10,242
l know what it is to
lose someone you love.

1098
01:44:10,811 --> 01:44:14,838
My own sister Talia,
so young, murdered by the Brood.

1099
01:44:17,851 --> 01:44:19,182
We can beg for mercy.

1100
01:44:21,088 --> 01:44:24,216
But, unfortunately this war
will not end with surrender.

1101
01:44:25,225 --> 01:44:28,592
lt will end with your fatherless
children enslaved.

1102
01:44:29,463 --> 01:44:32,455
Surrender only stokes
the enemy's fire.

1103
01:44:32,866 --> 01:44:36,358
Fight now and you will have
made a powerful statement!

1104
01:44:36,436 --> 01:44:39,928
Not just to Swope,
but to Dragon Eye and all of his ilk!

1105
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:42,565
That we are free
men and women!

1106
01:44:43,076 --> 01:44:46,273
Fight now for
the very freedom of Mirabilis!

1107
01:44:55,355 --> 01:44:58,051
Move and l'll
anoint you with a third eye.

1108
01:44:59,393 --> 01:45:01,418
You woo a woman,
you get literary.

1109
01:45:01,795 --> 01:45:05,754
You want to scare the
forcemeat out of a man be direct.

1110
01:45:07,267 --> 01:45:08,894
You doubt my deadliness?

1111
01:45:09,403 --> 01:45:10,870
l doubt your gender.

1112
01:45:12,105 --> 01:45:13,800
You're late.

1113
01:45:15,309 --> 01:45:17,539
l assume this
is about Tesselink's death.

1114
01:45:18,645 --> 01:45:21,910
That old sorcerer was
a thorn in Dragon Eye's side.

1115
01:45:22,149 --> 01:45:23,741
lf he wanted to galvanize
the free nations

1116
01:45:23,884 --> 01:45:25,351
he couldn't have done
a better job.

1117
01:45:25,452 --> 01:45:27,079
Dragon Eye's a madman.

1118
01:45:27,954 --> 01:45:33,756
He dotes on his spawn ranting
of the reawakening of his heir

1119
01:45:33,894 --> 01:45:36,863
and his own pathetic mortality.

1120
01:45:37,497 --> 01:45:38,555
This heir?

1121
01:45:39,333 --> 01:45:42,564
To look upon the
child sickens my stomach.

1122
01:45:43,337 --> 01:45:51,403
He is the son of your nightmare.
lmagine passing all that power to it.

1123
01:45:51,878 --> 01:45:53,072
Rather than to you?

1124
01:45:55,282 --> 01:45:57,477
Will there be a replacement
for Tesselink

1125
01:45:57,984 --> 01:46:00,509
or will the Elven nation
go it's own way?

1126
01:46:00,854 --> 01:46:03,414
Well, if that's what your
misshapen leader was counting on

1127
01:46:03,557 --> 01:46:05,616
it was a
serious miscalculation.

1128
01:46:06,793 --> 01:46:09,353
l was hoping you could
influence the Triune.

1129
01:46:10,497 --> 01:46:13,660
Head off anything untoward
in the way of retaliation.

1130
01:46:14,935 --> 01:46:17,631
All that war is to neither
of our advantage.

1131
01:46:17,771 --> 01:46:19,602
That's what l love
about you Splayven.

1132
01:46:20,707 --> 01:46:24,040
You're not an ideologue.
You're no zealot.

1133
01:46:24,745 --> 01:46:25,837
You're an old academy,

1134
01:46:25,979 --> 01:46:29,506
murderous bottom-feeder
just awaiting to assume the mantle.

1135
01:46:30,417 --> 01:46:34,615
Like you,
l trade in steel and blood.

1136
01:46:35,489 --> 01:46:38,185
Other currencies
are always greatly accepted.

1137
01:46:39,092 --> 01:46:41,890
My reign will be profitable.

1138
01:46:43,063 --> 01:46:45,554
You give me assurances that
attacks in the Keep will stop

1139
01:46:45,966 --> 01:46:48,457
and that no more political
figures will be targeted,

1140
01:46:49,302 --> 01:46:51,827
l'll see about avoiding
a bloody consequence.

1141
01:46:52,406 --> 01:46:54,636
You could start
by disbanding the knights.

1142
01:46:55,442 --> 01:46:56,875
When they've brought
home the Crucible,

1143
01:46:57,210 --> 01:46:58,199
then we'll talk.

1144
01:46:59,813 --> 01:47:01,405
You have great
faith in them.

1145
01:47:02,015 --> 01:47:03,880
More, indeed,
than l have in Swope.

1146
01:47:05,986 --> 01:47:07,613
What is Dragon Eye up to?

1147
01:47:08,855 --> 01:47:11,187
Rumor has it that he's building
some kind of super weapon.

1148
01:47:11,358 --> 01:47:17,263
Weapon? No, no.
What you are facing is far more serious.

1149
01:47:17,464 --> 01:47:18,362
How serious?

1150
01:47:18,465 --> 01:47:22,492
A Dragon Eye so powerful
you will have no choice

1151
01:47:22,636 --> 01:47:24,661
but to surrender to his tyranny.

1152
01:47:42,088 --> 01:47:44,454
Oh, you're a miner, like us.

1153
01:47:46,293 --> 01:47:48,955
Yes. Black Roc.

1154
01:47:49,296 --> 01:47:54,029
Ah, you're a Black Roc.
l was a merchant in Black Roc.

1155
01:47:54,134 --> 01:47:57,228
Several years ago when there
was so much Bloodsteel

1156
01:47:58,138 --> 01:47:59,503
they didn't know what
to do with it.

1157
01:47:59,806 --> 01:48:03,367
Prices going through the roof,
scruples in the other direction.

1158
01:48:03,510 --> 01:48:07,810
Neighbor killing neighbor.
And for what?

1159
01:48:09,015 --> 01:48:12,348
The power to watch our
butter churn by an enchantment?

1160
01:48:13,053 --> 01:48:15,647
The well has run
dry in Black Roc.

1161
01:48:16,656 --> 01:48:20,148
Now it is just another
dying mining town.

1162
01:48:23,296 --> 01:48:27,665
Perhaps one day
it will be reborn.

1163
01:48:27,767 --> 01:48:29,928
Yeah, well, when we finally
do run out of Bloodsteel,

1164
01:48:30,070 --> 01:48:32,334
maybe we'll find
something stronger.

1165
01:48:32,506 --> 01:48:34,406
Yeah, and what's that?

1166
01:48:37,244 --> 01:48:38,074
Our own power.

1167
01:48:46,086 --> 01:48:51,319
Klegg! Come out or your friend dies!

1168
01:48:52,759 --> 01:48:53,691
Klegg!

1169
01:48:54,394 --> 01:48:55,383
Show yourself!

1170
01:48:55,896 --> 01:48:59,798
They're back!
Come on you Brood scum!

1171
01:49:01,067 --> 01:49:01,658
Come.

1172
01:49:06,139 --> 01:49:07,766
Choose your side now, old man.

1173
01:49:07,908 --> 01:49:10,138
Alright, l could have translated
that wretched scroll

1174
01:49:10,277 --> 01:49:12,142
but they took Grell instead.

1175
01:49:12,312 --> 01:49:14,576
Grell doesn't know how to translate.

1176
01:49:15,749 --> 01:49:16,716
l'll go.

1177
01:49:17,584 --> 01:49:19,643
Hold your positions!
Listen to me,

1178
01:49:20,053 --> 01:49:22,078
if you go out
there you will surely die.

1179
01:49:22,289 --> 01:49:24,382
Now get your people
and barricade the back gate.

1180
01:49:24,524 --> 01:49:25,684
lt'll never hold.
Ber-Lak!

1181
01:49:25,892 --> 01:49:26,688
l'll, l'll try.

1182
01:49:28,328 --> 01:49:30,626
Your amulet really
told you Klegg lied?

1183
01:49:30,797 --> 01:49:32,697
Actually, no.
Depleted yesterday.

1184
01:49:33,333 --> 01:49:35,995
l need a fresh
infusion of steel.

1185
01:49:36,136 --> 01:49:38,297
Well, you really are
a liar then, huh?

1186
01:49:38,672 --> 01:49:40,970
You do live up
to your name Lady Perfidia.

1187
01:49:44,311 --> 01:49:47,747
And will you live up to yours,
Sir John?

1188
01:49:55,221 --> 01:49:58,088
Fools.
Must l do everything myself!?!

1189
01:49:59,292 --> 01:50:00,452
Bring me the rain of fire!

1190
01:50:09,536 --> 01:50:11,128
You think Swope knows we're here?

1191
01:50:11,605 --> 01:50:12,469
Not sure.

1192
01:50:13,340 --> 01:50:14,204
Faster!

1193
01:50:17,143 --> 01:50:17,973
Let it fly.

1194
01:50:34,327 --> 01:50:35,225
Rain of fire!

1195
01:50:36,396 --> 01:50:37,226
Get down!

1196
01:50:37,631 --> 01:50:38,563
Make way!

1197
01:50:51,711 --> 01:50:52,643
Get down!

1198
01:51:44,230 --> 01:51:45,128
Get out of here!

1199
01:52:15,261 --> 01:52:16,159
Are you all right?

1200
01:52:17,397 --> 01:52:19,661
That thing tried to kill me!
Of course l'm not all right!

1201
01:52:19,966 --> 01:52:21,456
Damn, l knew Swope
was a marauder.

1202
01:52:21,601 --> 01:52:23,535
l just didn't know
he was a wizard too.

1203
01:52:23,837 --> 01:52:27,534
Swope? He's not a wizard!
l'll take care of him.

1204
01:52:27,707 --> 01:52:28,731
Swope is mine.

1205
01:52:28,875 --> 01:52:32,072
No! l gave my word as
a Canthus Sorcerer.

1206
01:52:32,245 --> 01:52:33,769
He will be tried
by the Triune.

1207
01:52:34,748 --> 01:52:36,613
Your word means
nothing out here.

1208
01:52:36,916 --> 01:52:38,577
Kill him now
and you will answer to me.

1209
01:52:38,718 --> 01:52:41,118
l don't respond to threats
that don't draw blood.

1210
01:52:41,321 --> 01:52:44,051
John! l need you.

1211
01:52:46,192 --> 01:52:48,183
l need to know that l can trust you.

1212
01:52:50,396 --> 01:52:51,363
They're on the move.

1213
01:52:56,836 --> 01:52:58,428
l am putting down my weapon.

1214
01:52:59,472 --> 01:53:03,101
Devoted miners,
no more blood need be spilled.

1215
01:53:03,810 --> 01:53:07,644
Send out the monk Klegg
to translate this map.

1216
01:53:08,515 --> 01:53:10,483
You cannot survive
this siege!

1217
01:53:11,284 --> 01:53:15,345
l have dozens of machines
who merely await my command.

1218
01:53:16,356 --> 01:53:21,885
But, if you noble workers give up
l will spare Grell's life

1219
01:53:22,829 --> 01:53:26,765
and we will share the riches
of the Crucible itself.

1220
01:53:26,900 --> 01:53:29,232
The Crucible.
Do not believe him.

1221
01:53:29,369 --> 01:53:33,135
Do not surrender
and you will be sent to Gloom Fire!

1222
01:53:33,273 --> 01:53:35,104
Too late Brood scum!

1223
01:53:35,408 --> 01:53:36,568
Serragoth!?

1224
01:53:38,578 --> 01:53:40,273
l killed that human dog!

1225
01:53:40,413 --> 01:53:41,505
Wrong again.

1226
01:53:42,615 --> 01:53:44,082
What about the sorcerer whore?

1227
01:53:44,250 --> 01:53:45,808
Hold your tongue if you value it!

1228
01:53:45,952 --> 01:53:48,750
l'm the one that beheaded your
leader Azenhawke!

1229
01:53:48,888 --> 01:53:52,688
lt's my blood you want, Swope!
You come and get it.

1230
01:53:53,293 --> 01:53:54,817
You tempt me greatly citizen.

1231
01:53:55,628 --> 01:53:57,425
Well, does fear
loosen your bowels?

1232
01:53:58,131 --> 01:54:01,191
Let's do this.
Just you and l goblin.

1233
01:54:01,634 --> 01:54:05,400
No swords!
No arrows! Bare fists.

1234
01:54:05,538 --> 01:54:08,371
Or was Azenhawke correct
when he said you were a coward?

1235
01:54:09,809 --> 01:54:11,709
l will taste your blood!

1236
01:54:12,912 --> 01:54:17,440
But, first,
l want the word of the sorcerer.

1237
01:54:18,318 --> 01:54:20,912
You will surrender when l win.

1238
01:54:21,421 --> 01:54:27,291
l, Perfidia Aerie, give you
word as a Canthus sorcerer.

1239
01:54:29,128 --> 01:54:29,992
You better win.

1240
01:54:32,031 --> 01:54:33,293
Then let's end this!

1241
01:54:34,100 --> 01:54:36,159
lf you kill Swope
before we get the scroll,

1242
01:54:36,302 --> 01:54:37,564
you won't just damn yourself

1243
01:54:37,737 --> 01:54:40,501
you'll invite the gods
to damn Mirabilis.

1244
01:54:40,874 --> 01:54:43,240
l answer to a far baser power.

1245
01:54:44,677 --> 01:54:45,609
Come on!

1246
01:54:49,415 --> 01:54:50,245
Don't rush me, goblin.

1247
01:54:50,383 --> 01:54:53,045
l want to savor this,
every minute of it.

1248
01:54:53,286 --> 01:54:58,189
Shut up human dog!
You have no idea how l live for this.

1249
01:54:58,391 --> 01:54:59,585
Oh, l think l do goblin.

1250
01:54:59,726 --> 01:55:04,060
Give yourself up now.
And the monk called Klegg.

1251
01:55:04,264 --> 01:55:06,198
And l will spare the others.

1252
01:55:35,094 --> 01:55:36,755
You put up a better
fight than Azenhawke,

1253
01:55:36,896 --> 01:55:37,487
l'll give you that.

1254
01:55:37,630 --> 01:55:40,360
Shut your mouth,
or l'll fill it with your entrails!

1255
01:55:43,569 --> 01:55:45,764
That's just plain rude, goblin.

1256
01:56:34,320 --> 01:56:37,517
John, don't!
We'll never get the Crucible!

1257
01:56:38,291 --> 01:56:41,226
Ahh!

1258
01:56:45,498 --> 01:56:48,126
l didn't think you'd be that stupid.

1259
01:57:10,223 --> 01:57:12,657
Peasants. Humans.

1260
01:57:55,935 --> 01:57:57,630
Hey, look at this!
l found a sword.

1261
01:57:58,004 --> 01:57:59,369
lt's a nice one.
lt's not mine, but...

1262
01:57:59,505 --> 01:58:03,373
That's my sword!
You'll never live to find the Crucible.

1263
01:58:03,476 --> 01:58:06,673
lf you return to Dragon Eye
empty-handed, neither will you.

1264
01:58:06,813 --> 01:58:10,271
What makes you think
l work for that, that relic.

1265
01:58:10,416 --> 01:58:13,180
This map is nothing but
a bunch of chicken-scratch.

1266
01:58:14,887 --> 01:58:18,653
Reguatt carvase petrall voro.

1267
01:58:21,794 --> 01:58:24,092
Estrone?

1268
01:58:24,430 --> 01:58:26,489
You can read the language
of the ancients?

1269
01:58:26,666 --> 01:58:30,363
Read it, yes.
Understand it, no.

1270
01:58:30,870 --> 01:58:38,299
lt lies inside a hollow chest 'neath
troubled skies that know no rest.

1271
01:58:39,045 --> 01:58:43,482
A hallowed ground
of endless death.

1272
01:58:43,883 --> 01:58:49,515
War? Where darkness
lives forever more.

1273
01:58:50,890 --> 01:58:58,092
Be forewarned, no,
'neath the root of...oh.

1274
01:58:58,498 --> 01:59:00,227
l really didn't study
this as l should have.

1275
01:59:00,366 --> 01:59:01,890
This is gonna take time.

1276
01:59:02,001 --> 01:59:03,662
We don't have time.
You have to come with us.

1277
01:59:03,803 --> 01:59:04,827
l can't believe
you've traded

1278
01:59:04,971 --> 01:59:08,998
this murderer's life for
a load of rhyming nonsense.

1279
01:59:09,142 --> 01:59:10,074
Without Klegg and his map

1280
01:59:10,209 --> 01:59:12,905
we will never find the Crucible
in these mountains.

1281
01:59:13,045 --> 01:59:16,572
We deliver Swope to the Triune.
l gave them my word.

1282
01:59:16,716 --> 01:59:17,978
Does that mean anything to you?

1283
01:59:18,117 --> 01:59:22,053
Their idea of justice
and mine differ greatly, my lady.

1284
01:59:22,255 --> 01:59:26,988
A, a hallowed ground
of endless graves.

1285
01:59:28,961 --> 01:59:30,792
The last stand.

1286
01:59:31,164 --> 01:59:31,994
What's that?

1287
01:59:32,732 --> 01:59:35,223
Legend has it that there
was a great battle

1288
01:59:35,368 --> 01:59:37,336
in the mountains
where the Magus died.

1289
01:59:37,603 --> 01:59:39,161
Battlefield is a graveyard.

1290
01:59:40,740 --> 01:59:42,230
Maybe that's what it means.

1291
01:59:42,375 --> 01:59:45,742
There was a great battleground
where the Magus was buried.

1292
01:59:46,412 --> 01:59:48,778
So, we find the Magus,
we find the Crucible.

1293
01:59:49,782 --> 01:59:51,147
How do we find it?

1294
01:59:51,684 --> 01:59:53,777
That's why we have
our blind man.

1295
01:59:54,020 --> 01:59:56,181
You have no idea how
ridiculous that sounds.

1296
01:59:56,322 --> 01:59:59,553
As ridiculous as your lust
for killing this bastard.

1297
01:59:59,659 --> 02:00:02,651
l remember a day when maidens
didn't curse like the town sot.

1298
02:00:03,229 --> 02:00:04,355
Easy, my lady.

1299
02:00:04,730 --> 02:00:05,458
Easy.

1300
02:00:06,732 --> 02:00:08,097
l don't remember the poem saying

1301
02:00:08,234 --> 02:00:10,293
anything about the need
for mass murderers.

1302
02:00:10,436 --> 02:00:12,427
Don't we have you for that, John?

1303
02:00:29,088 --> 02:00:29,952
Must you go?

1304
02:00:34,493 --> 02:00:38,395
Ah, yes.
Knightly duties await.

1305
02:00:39,232 --> 02:00:40,028
Thank you.

1306
02:00:40,199 --> 02:00:40,961
Thank you.

1307
02:00:49,308 --> 02:00:50,570
Your heart is true.

1308
02:01:19,805 --> 02:01:20,567
My Lord.

1309
02:01:22,508 --> 02:01:26,205
l assume you have good reason
for interrupting.

1310
02:01:28,681 --> 02:01:29,739
l do, sire.

1311
02:01:32,318 --> 02:01:35,151
Who's this? A mercenary?

1312
02:01:35,288 --> 02:01:39,452
One of Swope's renegades.
Perhaps their only survivor.

1313
02:01:40,126 --> 02:01:42,492
One of our detachments
found him near the Spires.

1314
02:01:42,695 --> 02:01:44,253
Mercy, Dragon Eye.

1315
02:01:45,064 --> 02:01:46,361
We were attacked
by the Keep's knights

1316
02:01:46,499 --> 02:01:50,162
at the mining colony due east
of the Ballentin gorge.

1317
02:01:50,303 --> 02:01:52,863
And yet you kneel before me.

1318
02:01:53,572 --> 02:01:56,939
l begged Swope to listen, sire.
But he was mad with bloodlust.

1319
02:01:57,643 --> 02:01:58,735
And Swope?

1320
02:01:59,545 --> 02:02:01,479
Either dead or captured
like the others.

1321
02:02:02,748 --> 02:02:03,772
He had a map.

1322
02:02:04,917 --> 02:02:07,351
A map?
A map to the Crucible.

1323
02:02:07,486 --> 02:02:10,751
Only indecipherable writings.
We were looking for a translator.

1324
02:02:11,190 --> 02:02:15,183
These writings,
do the knights have them?

1325
02:02:16,095 --> 02:02:17,619
l cannot say for certain.

1326
02:02:18,798 --> 02:02:21,824
But, if they tortured Swope
then it is possible.

1327
02:02:24,704 --> 02:02:26,968
Your lordship, l bare a gift.

1328
02:02:27,106 --> 02:02:30,371
l found it on an envoy
l killed in your name, sire.

1329
02:02:32,378 --> 02:02:36,144
Ah, Tesselink.

1330
02:02:36,349 --> 02:02:38,544
You think it might point
the way to the Crucible?

1331
02:02:39,652 --> 02:02:46,490
More likely to the knights.
These knights, they are doomed.

1332
02:02:47,293 --> 02:02:49,625
Yet, they do not
abandon their cause.

1333
02:02:50,930 --> 02:02:57,165
But, you, you have abandoned
those closest to you.

1334
02:02:57,303 --> 02:02:58,930
No, l would die
for my leader.

1335
02:02:59,071 --> 02:03:01,665
You are not the first
to say you would die.

1336
02:03:03,509 --> 02:03:04,601
Please, my liege.

1337
02:03:04,977 --> 02:03:11,246
But, tell me, would you suffer?

1338
02:03:14,487 --> 02:03:15,454
l don't understand.

1339
02:03:15,721 --> 02:03:18,588
No, l did not think you would.

1340
02:03:18,991 --> 02:03:23,018
How l wish l could bargain
my life so easily!

1341
02:03:25,164 --> 02:03:26,028
Get out!

1342
02:03:33,506 --> 02:03:35,337
Let us end this now!

1343
02:04:24,690 --> 02:04:25,520
Perfidia?

1344
02:04:37,203 --> 02:04:37,862
He's gone!

1345
02:04:43,609 --> 02:04:44,871
You were on watch!

1346
02:04:46,178 --> 02:04:46,872
Damn.

1347
02:05:22,915 --> 02:05:24,177
Who did this!

1348
02:05:25,384 --> 02:05:26,043
John!

1349
02:05:26,185 --> 02:05:29,018
lf l had done it
l'd have used my bare hands.

1350
02:05:29,154 --> 02:05:32,817
Make me believe that!
l gave my word as a Canthus sorcerer!

1351
02:05:32,958 --> 02:05:36,155
Murderer!
Murderer hell swawn!

1352
02:05:36,295 --> 02:05:37,125
Maya!

1353
02:05:37,630 --> 02:05:38,119
Adric!

1354
02:05:38,264 --> 02:05:39,993
What in the gods
are you doing here!?!

1355
02:05:40,266 --> 02:05:43,667
l was coming to help you.
l was following this guardsman.

1356
02:05:43,802 --> 02:05:45,133
He was carrying
this device of Tesselink's.

1357
02:05:45,271 --> 02:05:47,967
A compass which pointed
to Lady Perfidia's amulet.

1358
02:05:48,107 --> 02:05:50,007
That means
Dragon Eye can track us.

1359
02:05:51,477 --> 02:05:53,377
Only if you hang on to the amulet.

1360
02:05:55,881 --> 02:05:56,905
What have you done!

1361
02:05:57,016 --> 02:05:59,109
What he deserved!
He is one of them!

1362
02:05:59,652 --> 02:06:02,746
He killed my brother!
He murdered them all!

1363
02:06:03,022 --> 02:06:05,422
Just like they butchered Tesselink.

1364
02:06:05,925 --> 02:06:08,985
Or don't you elves feel anything?

1365
02:06:10,229 --> 02:06:12,220
Perfidia! Stop!

1366
02:06:32,418 --> 02:06:39,586
Yes, it's in your hands now.
Guard it safely.

1367
02:07:10,489 --> 02:07:14,550
Once again l doubted you.
Forgive me.

1368
02:07:15,761 --> 02:07:17,285
There's no
forgiveness necessary.

1369
02:07:18,998 --> 02:07:21,091
Look, l'm sorry you
lost your grandfather.

1370
02:07:23,435 --> 02:07:27,667
He gave me that amulet
and told me never to take it off.

1371
02:07:30,042 --> 02:07:32,135
Perfidia, you've done
what you had to do.

1372
02:07:36,348 --> 02:07:38,714
The last time we were
alone there

1373
02:07:38,851 --> 02:07:41,319
was something in the way he talked
about the future.

1374
02:07:44,023 --> 02:07:45,490
Like he knew what was coming.

1375
02:07:46,592 --> 02:07:48,389
He was a sorcerer, Perfidia.

1376
02:07:50,396 --> 02:07:52,591
Yet, his second
sight couldn't save him.

1377
02:07:54,366 --> 02:07:56,334
Well, no one's safe anymore.
Not in the keep.

1378
02:07:56,468 --> 02:07:58,231
Not anywhere in Mirabilis.
Not now.

1379
02:08:01,240 --> 02:08:03,003
There's so much
he needed to teach me.

1380
02:08:04,243 --> 02:08:06,006
So much more l needed to learn.

1381
02:08:06,245 --> 02:08:08,145
You'll find new ways
to learn these truths.

1382
02:08:10,416 --> 02:08:11,576
l don't think so.

1383
02:08:13,018 --> 02:08:18,422
He, he said l would
and trusted me to forge ahead,

1384
02:08:19,825 --> 02:08:21,053
but l don't know how.

1385
02:08:23,162 --> 02:08:25,062
Look, our position
has been compromised.

1386
02:08:25,197 --> 02:08:26,164
We must leave now.

1387
02:08:26,298 --> 02:08:28,960
The truth is l never felt
worthy of his gifts.

1388
02:08:29,101 --> 02:08:31,399
Well, l doubt very much if
he would agree with you.

1389
02:08:31,804 --> 02:08:34,204
When this is over, you'll see.

1390
02:08:34,373 --> 02:08:36,705
And, for the first time
l'm beginning to doubt

1391
02:08:36,842 --> 02:08:38,833
if l can do what is asked of me.

1392
02:08:40,179 --> 02:08:42,079
You're talking like your
fate has been sealed.

1393
02:08:42,581 --> 02:08:43,775
More than you know.

1394
02:08:43,916 --> 02:08:46,646
This, this destiny
your grandfather spoke of,

1395
02:08:50,089 --> 02:08:51,021
what did he mean?

1396
02:08:52,191 --> 02:08:53,249
What has been asked of you?

1397
02:08:55,928 --> 02:09:00,729
lt means that l will not be
returning from this journey.

1398
02:09:03,035 --> 02:09:04,263
And you believe that?

1399
02:09:10,776 --> 02:09:12,073
l won't let it happen.

1400
02:10:00,058 --> 02:10:00,820
What was that?

1401
02:10:03,562 --> 02:10:05,029
What did you do before this?

1402
02:10:05,898 --> 02:10:08,492
Before you, you were a knight?

1403
02:10:09,902 --> 02:10:13,599
Oh, uh, entrepreneur.

1404
02:10:13,939 --> 02:10:14,735
lnventor.

1405
02:10:15,374 --> 02:10:16,466
Jack of all trades.

1406
02:10:17,276 --> 02:10:18,174
Then why do it?

1407
02:10:19,945 --> 02:10:20,741
l'm sorry?

1408
02:10:20,846 --> 02:10:21,835
Risk your life.

1409
02:10:22,447 --> 02:10:25,211
l mean, why put yourself out
when you really don't have to?

1410
02:10:26,285 --> 02:10:32,315
Oh, that, uh, well,
just doing my job.

1411
02:10:32,457 --> 02:10:35,255
You know. Being a knight.

1412
02:10:36,361 --> 02:10:39,797
l'll tell you what l think.
l think you're a fake.

1413
02:10:42,835 --> 02:10:45,736
Well, l think you
might be right.

1414
02:10:45,871 --> 02:10:51,935
No, no, l think you want people
to think you're a selfish scoundrel.

1415
02:10:52,110 --> 02:10:53,941
l think you feel more
comfortable that way.

1416
02:10:56,014 --> 02:10:59,643
You don't think it's just possible
that l am a selfish scoundrel?

1417
02:11:03,822 --> 02:11:07,588
Do you think that l am just
a woman of the caravans?

1418
02:11:09,928 --> 02:11:10,792
l don't.

1419
02:11:17,069 --> 02:11:22,006
Some may see that as my fate
but l am much more.

1420
02:11:22,241 --> 02:11:24,368
Oh, l know.
Yeah. l can see.

1421
02:11:28,413 --> 02:11:29,607
Am l wrong about you?

1422
02:11:34,152 --> 02:11:37,212
Maya, l, l don't mean
to shatter any illusion

1423
02:11:37,356 --> 02:11:40,848
but l make my living
fooling people

1424
02:11:42,461 --> 02:11:45,919
and right now
l think l'm fooling you.

1425
02:11:47,232 --> 02:11:49,564
l still think you're more
caring than you let on.

1426
02:11:50,636 --> 02:11:55,005
Yes, well, l have to admit this,

1427
02:11:56,642 --> 02:12:00,772
this journey, my knighthood,

1428
02:12:04,349 --> 02:12:06,840
it has made me see
things differently, but, ...

1429
02:12:11,089 --> 02:12:13,114
But, l am far from
the man you see.

1430
02:12:14,893 --> 02:12:15,951
Honestly, Maya.

1431
02:12:18,530 --> 02:12:19,895
Look, someone has to go back.

1432
02:12:20,098 --> 02:12:22,896
There's no telling how many scouts
Lord Splayven has dispatched.

1433
02:12:23,368 --> 02:12:26,394
Not you. We need your sword.

1434
02:12:27,673 --> 02:12:30,642
We have to get word back that
we have the map to the Crucible.

1435
02:12:30,776 --> 02:12:33,074
They must know before
the Brood knows.

1436
02:12:33,478 --> 02:12:34,376
l'll go.

1437
02:12:34,947 --> 02:12:36,244
You're in no condition to.

1438
02:12:36,381 --> 02:12:40,408
Wait! Perfidia, l'll go.
l can do this.

1439
02:12:41,920 --> 02:12:46,186
l know that you think me
only human but l can do this.

1440
02:12:50,929 --> 02:12:51,793
Kneel.

1441
02:12:52,064 --> 02:12:53,964
l kneel for no one.

1442
02:13:04,776 --> 02:13:07,176
By the powers of
the court of Black Roc,

1443
02:13:08,981 --> 02:13:14,783
l dub thee Lady Maya Duvais,
protector of Mirabilis.

1444
02:13:18,156 --> 02:13:19,145
Rise.

1445
02:13:24,963 --> 02:13:27,397
Follow the tree-line back
to Black Roc.

1446
02:13:27,733 --> 02:13:33,694
Stop for nothing.
Succeed Lady Maya. Go.

1447
02:13:51,757 --> 02:13:52,382
Good luck.

1448
02:14:03,735 --> 02:14:10,834
Father, time is moving past.
l feel the end grows closer.

1449
02:14:14,746 --> 02:14:21,242
Splayven, look upon my son.
He will soon be your ruler.

1450
02:14:50,082 --> 02:14:52,676
Our path takes us straight
through this gorge.

1451
02:14:53,085 --> 02:14:56,111
Well, it looks quiet enough.

1452
02:15:02,794 --> 02:15:03,726
Dead end.

1453
02:15:04,096 --> 02:15:04,824
Aye.

1454
02:15:05,797 --> 02:15:07,355
Doesn't smell good.

1455
02:15:09,234 --> 02:15:11,725
You sure you're reading that
map correctly old man?

1456
02:15:18,710 --> 02:15:20,075
This doesn't feel right.

1457
02:15:28,420 --> 02:15:29,148
Ber-Lak.

1458
02:15:31,756 --> 02:15:32,586
Ber-Lak!

1459
02:15:40,432 --> 02:15:41,797
This was the Oracle's.

1460
02:15:44,136 --> 02:15:46,127
Swope's taken it from his body.

1461
02:15:48,373 --> 02:15:55,006
Be forewarned,
not one moon left.

1462
02:15:57,883 --> 02:16:00,943
Who are you? Who's speaking?

1463
02:16:02,754 --> 02:16:03,948
Are you the Oracle.

1464
02:16:06,892 --> 02:16:08,519
Death awaits.

1465
02:16:09,361 --> 02:16:10,760
Oh, just great.

1466
02:16:17,369 --> 02:16:18,336
The demon.

1467
02:16:19,104 --> 02:16:21,265
What? A demon!

1468
02:16:23,108 --> 02:16:23,699
Wait!

1469
02:16:27,979 --> 02:16:28,673
Stop!

1470
02:16:29,181 --> 02:16:30,239
Klegg, stop!

1471
02:17:09,754 --> 02:17:10,448
Get back.

1472
02:19:19,517 --> 02:19:20,347
Perfidia.

1473
02:19:20,719 --> 02:19:21,879
Oh, what have l done?

1474
02:19:28,593 --> 02:19:32,552
Klegg, he's dead.

1475
02:19:38,470 --> 02:19:40,165
l thought it was my time

1476
02:19:41,873 --> 02:19:43,431
and l couldn't do it.

1477
02:19:45,009 --> 02:19:46,567
l couldn't do it.

1478
02:19:52,417 --> 02:19:54,146
Forgive me Tesselink.

1479
02:19:59,657 --> 02:20:03,753
l leave as the leader of the Brood.

1480
02:20:04,629 --> 02:20:07,291
l shall return a god.

1481
02:20:08,566 --> 02:20:11,433
Yes, that oft repeated phrase.

1482
02:20:12,170 --> 02:20:14,297
Your faith in me is lacking.

1483
02:20:14,539 --> 02:20:15,665
Not for a moment.

1484
02:20:16,408 --> 02:20:19,605
l, on the other hand,
have reason to doubt you.

1485
02:20:19,711 --> 02:20:20,507
Sire?

1486
02:20:23,515 --> 02:20:25,244
Did you really think
that you could collude

1487
02:20:25,383 --> 02:20:26,941
with the enemy without my knowing?

1488
02:20:27,085 --> 02:20:29,246
Someone has been feeding you lies.

1489
02:20:31,055 --> 02:20:33,421
Yes, and l'm looking at him.

1490
02:20:34,192 --> 02:20:35,989
Despite your precautions,

1491
02:20:36,127 --> 02:20:38,357
l saw you meeting with the
captain of the guard.

1492
02:20:38,496 --> 02:20:40,361
With the sole intention
of making the enemy

1493
02:20:40,498 --> 02:20:43,899
so fearful that they would
surrender at the next provocation.

1494
02:20:45,036 --> 02:20:46,526
What were you going to do?

1495
02:20:46,771 --> 02:20:48,762
Wait until l returned
with the Crucible

1496
02:20:48,907 --> 02:20:51,501
and then assassinate me
before l could use it?

1497
02:20:51,876 --> 02:20:54,868
Perhaps to murder
my son in his sleep

1498
02:20:55,013 --> 02:20:55,877
and feed him to the rats!

1499
02:20:56,014 --> 02:20:57,675
The things you say! Never!

1500
02:20:57,816 --> 02:20:59,181
Tell me your plans!

1501
02:20:59,317 --> 02:21:02,718
l will prove my allegiance.
l will lead the hunt.

1502
02:21:03,321 --> 02:21:05,482
lt's too late, Splayven.

1503
02:21:06,424 --> 02:21:10,451
What l do, l do for the world.

1504
02:21:11,830 --> 02:21:17,564
For the world? You!
You abomination!

1505
02:21:18,536 --> 02:21:22,996
lt was l who cursed your son!
You will both rot in hell!

1506
02:21:28,279 --> 02:21:30,770
No. No. No!

1507
02:21:37,188 --> 02:21:41,887
Remember, the Crucible or death.

1508
02:22:51,629 --> 02:22:56,430
Grandfather, when are you going
to tell me about the third gift.

1509
02:22:56,634 --> 02:23:02,698
Such impatience.
Learn the first two, earn the third.

1510
02:23:05,910 --> 02:23:08,401
Everyone dies Perfidia.

1511
02:23:09,480 --> 02:23:11,744
l can only tell
you that the time

1512
02:23:11,883 --> 02:23:16,217
of the reckoning
will be of your own choosing.

1513
02:23:17,455 --> 02:23:19,082
l don't know if l can.

1514
02:24:14,612 --> 02:24:15,840
Swope.

1515
02:25:41,199 --> 02:25:42,598
Can you not heal yourself?

1516
02:25:43,901 --> 02:25:49,305
l'm too weak.
My second sight fails me.

1517
02:25:51,209 --> 02:25:53,507
lt takes all my
will to continue.

1518
02:25:57,181 --> 02:26:02,642
That's it.
Perfidia, will.

1519
02:26:02,954 --> 02:26:06,446
That is the power that
no one can give you

1520
02:26:06,724 --> 02:26:08,555
and no one can take from you.

1521
02:26:11,329 --> 02:26:15,698
Learn the first two,
earn the third.

1522
02:26:17,135 --> 02:26:23,301
This power.
ls that what it is to be human?

1523
02:26:26,444 --> 02:26:27,308
Aye.

1524
02:26:32,950 --> 02:26:33,939
You're hurt.

1525
02:26:36,788 --> 02:26:37,618
Rest.

1526
02:26:42,260 --> 02:26:46,060
So, without the map or Klegg,

1527
02:26:48,533 --> 02:26:50,330
how are we to find
this battlefield?

1528
02:26:51,402 --> 02:26:56,271
Before the alignment at dawn,
your guess is as good as mine.

1529
02:27:13,491 --> 02:27:18,895
How, how long can,
can spell like this persist.

1530
02:27:21,199 --> 02:27:22,598
The Oracle can't.

1531
02:27:23,501 --> 02:27:26,368
You have to fight
to rekindle your will.

1532
02:27:28,339 --> 02:27:29,237
Fight.

1533
02:27:31,742 --> 02:27:32,709
Or give in.

1534
02:27:37,415 --> 02:27:39,144
Perhaps it's better this way.

1535
02:27:48,860 --> 02:27:49,792
Ber-Lak?

1536
02:27:53,064 --> 02:27:53,996
That's it.

1537
02:27:55,800 --> 02:27:57,631
Can you let the Oracle in?

1538
02:27:59,503 --> 02:28:01,528
l've been trying
to hold him back.

1539
02:28:01,672 --> 02:28:05,130
No. lf there's any time to talk
to the old man it is now.

1540
02:28:15,620 --> 02:28:18,748
Who are you? Oracle?

1541
02:28:28,599 --> 02:28:30,590
Talk some sense into this vessel.

1542
02:28:30,735 --> 02:28:31,793
There's no time.

1543
02:28:32,103 --> 02:28:35,504
Oracle, can you tell us about
the great battle to defeat the Magus?

1544
02:28:35,706 --> 02:28:39,870
The great battle, yes.

1545
02:28:41,746 --> 02:28:43,145
Yes.

1546
02:28:44,615 --> 02:28:48,745
So long ago,
l've almost forgotten.

1547
02:28:49,153 --> 02:28:52,953
The great battle
of the last stand.

1548
02:28:55,026 --> 02:28:58,655
Do you know where it was?
Can you lead us there?

1549
02:28:59,931 --> 02:29:02,525
You wish to
go to this dark place.

1550
02:29:03,434 --> 02:29:05,368
Do you think
you are worthy?

1551
02:29:12,043 --> 02:29:14,307
The Crucible should stay buried.

1552
02:29:15,479 --> 02:29:19,245
Too many people have been
sacrificed in its pursuit.

1553
02:29:21,052 --> 02:29:22,644
The Magus was a hero.

1554
02:29:24,255 --> 02:29:29,591
Then the power and wealth of
Bloodsteel twisted his soul

1555
02:29:30,361 --> 02:29:32,556
so much so that
his offspring

1556
02:29:32,697 --> 02:29:35,860
Dragon Eye was born
an abomination.

1557
02:29:37,535 --> 02:29:40,561
Do you worship such power,
Perfidia?

1558
02:29:45,343 --> 02:29:48,278
Do you seek such riches, Adric?

1559
02:29:51,048 --> 02:29:55,917
Do such ambitions rule your soul,
John Serragoth?

1560
02:29:56,821 --> 02:30:00,757
Would you trade your spirit
for the Bloodsteel?

1561
02:30:01,392 --> 02:30:03,587
Would you like to die
a second time, old man?

1562
02:30:04,862 --> 02:30:06,625
l have no faith in any of this.

1563
02:30:06,764 --> 02:30:08,857
Then what have you faith in?

1564
02:30:09,000 --> 02:30:13,198
Not in magic.
So, damn your prophesy.

1565
02:30:13,671 --> 02:30:16,834
Damn Bloodsteel.
Damn the Crucible.

1566
02:30:17,041 --> 02:30:19,100
And, damn you, old man.

1567
02:30:29,053 --> 02:30:30,145
Well said.

1568
02:30:34,025 --> 02:30:34,889
Yes.

1569
02:30:40,765 --> 02:30:41,823
This way.

1570
02:30:43,868 --> 02:30:48,464
Perfidia, may l have a
word with you please. Alone.

1571
02:30:55,980 --> 02:30:58,210
lf this is another one
of your rants coming.

1572
02:30:59,750 --> 02:31:01,217
ln answer to his question,

1573
02:31:02,787 --> 02:31:07,019
there is one that l have
faith in and that's you.

1574
02:31:14,765 --> 02:31:17,097
Perfidia's amulet.

1575
02:31:22,306 --> 02:31:24,774
Mm, Tesselink's toy.

1576
02:32:17,294 --> 02:32:23,529
This is it.
The canyon of the last stand.

1577
02:32:26,837 --> 02:32:29,431
The Magus met his defeat here.

1578
02:32:32,042 --> 02:32:35,307
Untold scores gave their lives.

1579
02:32:39,150 --> 02:32:40,276
Such pain.

1580
02:32:42,219 --> 02:32:43,686
About the right vintage

1581
02:32:44,788 --> 02:32:47,848
for the Magus
to have stashed the Crucible.

1582
02:32:48,492 --> 02:32:53,987
But quick. Soon it will be
dawn of the last day.

1583
02:32:56,133 --> 02:32:58,328
The stars wait for no one.

1584
02:32:59,937 --> 02:33:04,101
So, uh, anywhere in particular
we ought to be digging?

1585
02:33:06,177 --> 02:33:07,041
Ber-Lak?

1586
02:33:08,712 --> 02:33:10,805
l cannot tell you what
to look for.

1587
02:33:13,050 --> 02:33:16,417
Great. Well, l'm sure
it's something that's,

1588
02:33:17,021 --> 02:33:18,648
you know, Crucible shaped.

1589
02:33:19,690 --> 02:33:22,716
l feel like l'm being watched.

1590
02:33:23,961 --> 02:33:25,758
The spirit of your
grandfather maybe.

1591
02:33:28,199 --> 02:33:31,327
lf so, it is to my shame.

1592
02:33:36,140 --> 02:33:37,300
Beneath the root.

1593
02:33:41,946 --> 02:33:43,538
lt's beneath the root.

1594
02:33:44,014 --> 02:33:46,949
The map said
it was beneath the root.

1595
02:33:59,196 --> 02:33:59,992
Long dead.

1596
02:34:00,698 --> 02:34:02,859
The mark of the Magus.

1597
02:34:05,970 --> 02:34:07,198
Here he must lay.

1598
02:34:08,973 --> 02:34:10,838
Well then, let's get
our backs into it.

1599
02:34:11,175 --> 02:34:12,938
Huh? Let's go.

1600
02:34:39,036 --> 02:34:40,901
This is a warrior's burial site.

1601
02:34:49,013 --> 02:34:50,275
How are we gonna move his?

1602
02:35:13,604 --> 02:35:14,502
Thank god.

1603
02:35:16,573 --> 02:35:17,403
Look!

1604
02:35:22,346 --> 02:35:25,076
Hurry, or the Crucible
will become powerless.

1605
02:35:26,383 --> 02:35:27,782
Let's get busy then, huh?

1606
02:35:44,835 --> 02:35:46,462
That's Dragon Eye's ancestor.

1607
02:35:50,140 --> 02:35:51,801
Well, so much
for the Crucible, huh?

1608
02:35:55,412 --> 02:35:57,676
Maybe it crumbled
with the rest of him.

1609
02:35:59,383 --> 02:36:02,079
Ber-Lak. Are you back?

1610
02:36:02,453 --> 02:36:03,078
What?

1611
02:36:04,154 --> 02:36:05,086
Just checking.

1612
02:36:07,825 --> 02:36:10,350
lt lies inside a hollow chest.

1613
02:36:12,763 --> 02:36:14,321
Anyone else think
we've been conned?

1614
02:36:24,041 --> 02:36:24,735
Listen.

1615
02:36:28,379 --> 02:36:29,175
What?

1616
02:36:29,380 --> 02:36:30,369
Can you hear it?

1617
02:36:33,650 --> 02:36:34,344
Hear what?

1618
02:36:39,390 --> 02:36:40,721
lt's coming from in there.

1619
02:36:49,867 --> 02:36:53,200
lt's a chest.
lt's, it's a chest!

1620
02:36:59,610 --> 02:37:01,441
l think this is
what we've been looking for.

1621
02:37:02,980 --> 02:37:04,504
Anyone want to do the honors?

1622
02:37:04,615 --> 02:37:06,139
Just open the damn thing.

1623
02:37:08,085 --> 02:37:09,074
Does it have a lock?

1624
02:37:09,219 --> 02:37:10,151
Pry it open.

1625
02:37:10,454 --> 02:37:12,547
No, we can't risk breaking
what's inside.

1626
02:37:12,689 --> 02:37:14,657
Look, it's not
a damn chastity belt.

1627
02:37:14,792 --> 02:37:17,158
lf we don't get to
what's inside before sunrise

1628
02:37:17,327 --> 02:37:19,318
it won't matter what the
hell condition it's in.

1629
02:37:19,797 --> 02:37:26,168
Please, allow me.
Just give me a moment.

1630
02:37:31,141 --> 02:37:39,515
Wait a minute.
Just, there's always a catch.

1631
02:38:17,688 --> 02:38:19,815
l've never seen anything so pure.

1632
02:38:22,025 --> 02:38:24,323
The original shard of Bloodsteel.

1633
02:38:26,697 --> 02:38:28,460
Some say it came from the sky

1634
02:38:28,599 --> 02:38:32,091
and from it all
Bloodsteel sprang forth.

1635
02:38:54,057 --> 02:38:58,756
See, it will cause more
harm than good.

1636
02:38:59,162 --> 02:39:02,461
Let it be. lf none
of us touch it then...

1637
02:39:02,599 --> 02:39:03,930
Listen to me, Ber-Lak.

1638
02:39:04,601 --> 02:39:09,004
We are at war against zealots
who are sworn to destroy us.

1639
02:39:09,273 --> 02:39:13,266
Seeking advantage is more
than right, it is just.

1640
02:39:13,410 --> 02:39:16,379
The only guarantee
is more suffering.

1641
02:39:16,613 --> 02:39:18,444
Not if we use it
for the common good.

1642
02:39:18,582 --> 02:39:20,641
The people will be spoiled.

1643
02:39:20,817 --> 02:39:23,047
They will become drunk
with their power.

1644
02:39:23,453 --> 02:39:27,048
Do you really want all that
power in unwashed hands!?!

1645
02:39:27,157 --> 02:39:29,819
Do you want it in
Dragon Eye's hands?

1646
02:39:29,960 --> 02:39:31,621
You wish to be gods!

1647
02:39:31,762 --> 02:39:35,061
We violate the domain of
the gods every time we think,

1648
02:39:35,198 --> 02:39:37,166
every time we imagine
a better day.

1649
02:39:38,368 --> 02:39:40,393
Bloodsteel is our best hope.

1650
02:39:40,837 --> 02:39:45,001
Destiny will intervene.
lt always does.

1651
02:39:45,142 --> 02:39:47,508
We will make our own destiny.

1652
02:39:50,447 --> 02:39:51,243
We?

1653
02:39:51,782 --> 02:39:54,080
You always said you
were more than a vessel.

1654
02:39:55,886 --> 02:39:58,946
Ber-Lak, this is your
chance to prove it.

1655
02:40:16,740 --> 02:40:22,645
l, l pray for your strength
in carrying this burden.

1656
02:40:32,990 --> 02:40:34,321
The gods be with us.

1657
02:40:39,630 --> 02:40:43,589
l never actually believed
it existed until now.

1658
02:40:47,070 --> 02:40:49,732
You are every
bit as good as they say.

1659
02:40:50,040 --> 02:40:53,066
Now please surrender
the Crucible

1660
02:40:53,210 --> 02:40:55,678
before your
blood soaks the sand.

1661
02:40:59,116 --> 02:41:05,385
So, this is where my father,
the great Magus, died.

1662
02:41:06,723 --> 02:41:12,184
No tombs for his honor.
No great ziggurat for his afterlife.

1663
02:41:13,263 --> 02:41:19,691
Just an unmarked grave.
A battlefield burial.

1664
02:41:19,803 --> 02:41:21,600
Do not do it, Sir John.

1665
02:41:22,039 --> 02:41:22,903
Your friends will be dead

1666
02:41:23,040 --> 02:41:25,065
in the time it takes
to lift your weapon.

1667
02:41:27,377 --> 02:41:28,537
You're too late.

1668
02:41:28,812 --> 02:41:31,440
Oh, l'm going
to take the Crucible.

1669
02:41:32,149 --> 02:41:33,878
That is not at issue.

1670
02:41:34,718 --> 02:41:38,484
What is at issue is whether
l will allow any of you to live.

1671
02:41:39,623 --> 02:41:42,717
You have already desecrated
my ancestor's grave.

1672
02:41:42,859 --> 02:41:44,349
There wasn't much left of him.

1673
02:41:44,494 --> 02:41:46,928
Perfidia, do you really wish

1674
02:41:47,064 --> 02:41:49,294
to join your grandfather
in the after?

1675
02:41:49,433 --> 02:41:50,491
Go to hell!

1676
02:41:51,001 --> 02:41:54,027
Enough of this farce.
Kill them all!

1677
02:42:59,770 --> 02:43:00,600
Ber-Lak.

1678
02:43:19,156 --> 02:43:20,987
You are no Oracle.

1679
02:43:21,558 --> 02:43:25,153
You are a guileless,
slow-witted goblin.

1680
02:43:27,030 --> 02:43:30,022
My name is Ber-Lak!

1681
02:43:31,268 --> 02:43:36,501
Then, Ber-Lak, 'til the day
you die you shall

1682
02:43:36,640 --> 02:43:38,733
be remembered
for your part in seeing

1683
02:43:38,875 --> 02:43:41,639
the Crucible in the hands
of it's rightful heir.

1684
02:43:59,296 --> 02:44:00,263
Ber-Lak.

1685
02:44:03,533 --> 02:44:04,557
Ber-Lak!

1686
02:44:29,059 --> 02:44:29,923
No.

1687
02:44:35,432 --> 02:44:36,421
The Crucible.

1688
02:44:37,200 --> 02:44:37,928
Now!

1689
02:44:38,335 --> 02:44:39,563
Don't listen to him John.

1690
02:44:39,736 --> 02:44:42,967
As long as you hold it he'll
be too helpless to take it.

1691
02:44:49,613 --> 02:44:50,773
Give me the Crucible.

1692
02:44:51,114 --> 02:44:52,706
Give it to me
and she will live.

1693
02:44:53,416 --> 02:44:54,383
Let her go.

1694
02:44:55,118 --> 02:44:58,815
Without this you're nothing
but a twisted madman.

1695
02:44:58,922 --> 02:45:04,155
Am l?
The rule of elven kind is over.

1696
02:45:04,327 --> 02:45:09,060
The rule of goblin kind
and human kind, over.

1697
02:45:09,866 --> 02:45:13,768
We are entering
the true age of miracles.

1698
02:45:14,137 --> 02:45:17,402
The true ruler of
Mirabilis shall be reborn.

1699
02:45:18,241 --> 02:45:20,436
What is the Crucible to you?

1700
02:45:21,912 --> 02:45:25,439
Do you care of their
world human?

1701
02:45:26,716 --> 02:45:29,947
Where is your wife,
your child?

1702
02:45:31,922 --> 02:45:34,482
Did elven or goblin come
to their rescue?

1703
02:45:36,059 --> 02:45:38,550
Your wrath is your answer.

1704
02:45:39,396 --> 02:45:41,762
Give me the Crucible
and know what it is

1705
02:45:41,898 --> 02:45:44,093
to be watched over by a god

1706
02:45:44,234 --> 02:45:47,397
who will honor and
complete your vengeance.

1707
02:45:49,806 --> 02:45:55,472
ls the Crucible worth one single life?
Her life?

1708
02:46:01,985 --> 02:46:02,917
You love her.

1709
02:46:07,657 --> 02:46:08,555
Yes.

1710
02:46:10,860 --> 02:46:11,292
John.

1711
02:46:11,428 --> 02:46:14,989
Then know what it is to be
a husband and father again.

1712
02:46:15,131 --> 02:46:17,565
-Stop it.
-Nothing is worth losing that.

1713
02:46:18,101 --> 02:46:20,501
lmagine your life
without your beloved.

1714
02:46:20,670 --> 02:46:25,869
Moments, days, years knowing
you were helpless to save them.

1715
02:46:26,409 --> 02:46:28,104
You would do anything.

1716
02:46:28,578 --> 02:46:31,308
Burn the world down
just so they would awaken.

1717
02:46:40,724 --> 02:46:41,486
l'm sorry.

1718
02:46:53,670 --> 02:46:54,659
No!

1719
02:47:00,310 --> 02:47:01,242
Perfidia.

1720
02:47:22,065 --> 02:47:22,827
No.

1721
02:47:26,269 --> 02:47:26,963
No.

1722
02:47:27,270 --> 02:47:28,965
You'll destroy everything!

1723
02:47:29,139 --> 02:47:30,731
Then l'll see you in hell!

1724
02:47:37,847 --> 02:47:38,836
What have you done!?

1725
02:47:51,327 --> 02:47:52,089
Perfidia!

1726
02:47:53,730 --> 02:47:54,526
Don't go.

1727
02:47:55,031 --> 02:47:55,793
Don't go.

1728
02:47:56,032 --> 02:47:57,590
Oh, God!

1729
02:47:57,801 --> 02:48:00,668
Oh, come back. Come back.

1730
02:48:05,041 --> 02:48:08,738
Grandfather, when are you going
to tell me about the third gift.

1731
02:48:09,279 --> 02:48:13,010
Learn the first two,
earn the third.

1732
02:48:14,250 --> 02:48:16,480
lt takes all my will to continue.

1733
02:48:16,619 --> 02:48:20,214
That's it.
Perfidia, will.

1734
02:48:20,790 --> 02:48:23,224
That is the power that no one can

1735
02:48:23,359 --> 02:48:26,351
give you and no one can
take from you.

1736
02:48:47,684 --> 02:48:48,878
l love you.

1737
02:49:32,529 --> 02:49:36,761
Citizens, free men
and women of Mirabilis,

1738
02:49:37,133 --> 02:49:40,125
it is a new day,
a new world.

1739
02:49:41,037 --> 02:49:43,528
lt is also a day to remember
the goblin knight,

1740
02:49:43,673 --> 02:49:47,803
Ber-Lak, who gave his life
so that we may live in freedom.

1741
02:49:49,012 --> 02:49:52,539
ln his spirit, and in the
spirit of the great Tesselink,

1742
02:49:52,882 --> 02:49:54,281
the elven council has voted

1743
02:49:54,417 --> 02:49:57,250
in a new representative
for the Triune,

1744
02:49:58,087 --> 02:50:01,488
Lady Perfidia Aerie,
knight of Mirabilis.

1745
02:50:18,608 --> 02:50:24,808
l pledge as a Canthus sorcerer
and granddaughter of Tesselink,

1746
02:50:25,982 --> 02:50:28,917
that l will serve this Triune
and the people

1747
02:50:29,052 --> 02:50:31,953
of Mirabilis with all my heart

1748
02:50:32,088 --> 02:50:35,546
and all my being,
until the day l die.

1749
02:50:36,459 --> 02:50:39,724
And, to those who dare hope
to challenge

1750
02:50:40,363 --> 02:50:42,024
for the office of nimrod,

1751
02:50:43,032 --> 02:50:45,557
with the powers of the court
of Black Roc,

1752
02:50:46,903 --> 02:50:51,567
l put forth one command
and one command only,

1753
02:50:54,811 --> 02:50:55,709
succeed.

1754
02:51:12,362 --> 02:51:16,389
lt seems that the
Triune will be all female.

1755
02:51:16,633 --> 02:51:17,622
l'll drink to that.

1756
02:51:19,469 --> 02:51:25,271
We came so close to getting
the Crucible and endless Bloodsteel.

1757
02:51:25,708 --> 02:51:27,175
Perhaps we're better
off that.

1758
02:51:28,311 --> 02:51:29,175
A toast.

1759
02:51:29,412 --> 02:51:30,242
Thank you.

1760
02:51:32,982 --> 02:51:36,884
To a new era in Mirabilis,
without Dragon Eye.

1761
02:51:42,959 --> 02:51:43,721
Maya!

1762
02:51:45,295 --> 02:51:47,422
Tell me that
doesn't make you feel proud.

1763
02:51:48,464 --> 02:51:51,592
Oh, it does.
Very proud.

1764
02:51:54,304 --> 02:51:59,367
Adric, l hope that l haven't
raised expectations too much.

1765
02:52:00,343 --> 02:52:02,243
Things are different now.

1766
02:52:03,146 --> 02:52:05,979
Hm. How so?

1767
02:52:06,783 --> 02:52:08,478
lt's a new world.

1768
02:52:08,618 --> 02:52:10,711
Now that we can't count on
Bloodsteel to do everything

1769
02:52:10,853 --> 02:52:12,286
for us we're going to have

1770
02:52:12,422 --> 02:52:15,255
to find other ways to make
this a better place.

1771
02:52:15,391 --> 02:52:18,986
l have a chance to become
a justice nimrod.

1772
02:52:20,730 --> 02:52:24,689
Really? What about us?

1773
02:52:28,004 --> 02:52:28,993
Us?

1774
02:52:30,373 --> 02:52:32,204
Being a justice nimrod.

1775
02:52:32,308 --> 02:52:35,573
So much dangerous work.
Such a commitment.

1776
02:52:35,845 --> 02:52:38,245
Something that you know
a little about.

1777
02:52:38,381 --> 02:52:43,546
Yeah, well, when it comes
to commitment, well, you know me.

1778
02:52:44,987 --> 02:52:46,887
Yes, Adric, l think l do.

1779
02:53:06,075 --> 02:53:09,306
Well, Vosjek, l think you've
finally made a decent blade.

1780
02:53:09,679 --> 02:53:12,045
Just don't lose that one, John.

1781
02:53:12,448 --> 02:53:16,441
Well, l did not lose the others.
l discarded them.

1782
02:53:17,687 --> 02:53:18,449
Really?

1783
02:53:18,721 --> 02:53:22,282
Aye. Now, what is that
nonsense you put on the blades?

1784
02:53:24,026 --> 02:53:28,554
An oil from far east
with amazing virtues.

1785
02:53:43,045 --> 02:53:43,909
Thank you, my friend.

1786
02:53:44,046 --> 02:53:45,138
God speed.

1787
02:53:56,893 --> 02:54:00,021
There's so many toasts made
in our honor, John.

1788
02:54:01,664 --> 02:54:03,154
Especially to Ber-Lak.

1789
02:54:03,599 --> 02:54:07,797
Deservedly so.
He was a truly decent soul.

1790
02:54:08,905 --> 02:54:10,600
We are diminished without him.

1791
02:54:12,375 --> 02:54:15,310
We're so much better together.

1792
02:54:16,646 --> 02:54:19,342
Better than any of us could
have been on their own.

1793
02:54:19,482 --> 02:54:21,848
Aye, but we
all have our own paths.

1794
02:54:23,986 --> 02:54:25,578
l must continue down mine.

1795
02:54:26,656 --> 02:54:28,783
Didn't you learn
anything out there, John?

1796
02:54:28,925 --> 02:54:30,017
Oh, but l did, my lady.

1797
02:54:30,159 --> 02:54:34,152
Then you will consider returning
as a knight to serve?

1798
02:54:34,297 --> 02:54:38,893
Hm. There is nothing
l would rather do.

1799
02:54:39,101 --> 02:54:40,068
Nothing more?

1800
02:54:48,911 --> 02:54:49,809
Nothing.

1801
02:54:53,816 --> 02:54:57,809
Our tale ends as all tales do,
at the beginning.

1802
02:54:58,387 --> 02:55:02,756
The Crucible was gone
but everything important endured.

1803
02:55:03,459 --> 02:55:05,017
Hearts were joined
and spurned

1804
02:55:05,161 --> 02:55:07,356
by something stronger
than Bloodsteel.

1805
02:55:08,331 --> 02:55:12,700
And the citizens of Mirabilis
looked to the heavens once more.

1806
02:55:13,669 --> 02:55:16,695
ln fear, but also with hope.

1807
02:55:17,240 --> 02:55:22,906
Our tale ends as all tales do,
with the possibility of a beginning.
