1
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:27,400
- Hey, I'm gonna go now

2
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:29,000
- Okay, are you coming back?

3
00:01:29,100 --> 00:01:32,100
- Yeah, yeah, I'll be back very soon
I've just something to do in my house

4
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:35,600
but I'll be back, okay?
- Okay, shall I have to go to my home?

5
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,200
- No, definitely not.
But I'm a bit pissed.

6
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:42,900
I will be back to get you. Okay? Promised.

7
00:01:43,300 --> 00:01:45,100
I...I'have just something to do
really fast. I'll be back.

8
00:01:45,100 --> 00:01:46,200
- Okay

9
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,100
- Have fun

10
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:16,100
- You haven't told me what
you're gonna do you?

11
00:02:17,600 --> 00:02:20,000
- I haven't decided yet

12
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
- You know, I wish you would

13
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,600
You're gonna go to New York, 
I can tell

14
00:02:33,600 --> 00:02:34,800
- I haven't decided anything yet

15
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,500
- Can you make up your mind, because 
this is a fucking waste of my time

16
00:02:38,500 --> 00:02:40,000
- Excuse me...

17
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,000
- No, I'm...no, no, I'm...

18
00:02:48,900 --> 00:02:51,600
I just keep thinking about
how much I'm gonna miss you

19
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,800
- Tell me that you're gonna miss me again

20
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,700
- What?

21
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:05,300
- Tell me that you'll miss me

22
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,300
- Okay

23
00:03:09,700 --> 00:03:12,300
- If you go, I'll miss you

24
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:22,400
- Stop...I've gonna get to the door
- No...

25
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:26,400
- One second

26
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:29,100
Absolutely, one second
- You promise, it will be one second

27
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,600
- It doesn't smell

28
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,600
- No, if you're happy and
dry a shit, it doesn't

29
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:49,100
- Yup

30
00:03:50,600 --> 00:03:53,100
- I'm...I'm burned it.
- I can tell

31
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:55,200
- That's a genius
- Absolutely

32
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:58,500
- What about you? Do you have any?
- No

33
00:03:59,700 --> 00:04:01,700
- That sucks, dude, I'm sorry

34
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,000
- I know, I'm super a lame

35
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,000
- Oh, yeah, you're a lamer.
You wanna any?

36
00:04:09,500 --> 00:04:12,000
- No, I have any money,
if not I would.

37
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,300
- No, no, no, no I mean like

38
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,300
we can go back to my place
where I get some

39
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:18,200
- Really?
-  If you want to

40
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:22,500
- Okay...Sure.

41
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,400
- Are you sure?

42
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:28,700
- I've never been more sure about anything
in my entire life

43
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:31,000
- Okay...okay!

44
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:50,600
- Are you okay? You okay?
- I'm fine

45
00:04:50,700 --> 00:04:52,700
- Good, good
- I'm fine

46
00:04:53,200 --> 00:04:55,200
- It's okay. I was a beginner once too.

47
00:05:02,700 --> 00:05:05,000
- You like it?
- Yeah

48
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:07,500
Yeah, it's good

49
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:11,600
- You're full of surprises, don't you?

50
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:14,600
- Am I, no?

51
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,500
- You're weird

52
00:05:19,300 --> 00:05:21,200
- I am weird?
- Yeah

53
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:27,200
- Am I weird or am I surprising?

54
00:05:29,300 --> 00:05:31,300
- I like you as both I think

55
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,600
- You know, I feel like people
don't get you all the time

56
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:45,600
- You think people don't get me?

57
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,500
- I mean, with me there is nothing
really to get

58
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,700
- I'm just...bare

59
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:58,600
but you, you're like...
- Shut up, shut up

60
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:08,300
- Do you think

61
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,700
I'll get you?

62
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,800
- Hey
- Hey...Hey

63
00:06:36,500 --> 00:06:38,400
- You wanna a ride?

64
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:43,700
It's cold the fuck out there, man

65
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:02,000
- You're all right?
- Yeah...just...

66
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:05,200
- You left the party pretty quickly.

67
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:09,400
Come on! You wanna talk abouti it?

68
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:11,900
-Hmmm...

69
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:17,300
I...and...maybe.

70
00:07:22,100 --> 00:07:23,600
- Okay

71
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:31,000
- So... 

72
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:33,900
what's up with you?

73
00:07:37,900 --> 00:07:39,700
You run out of there.

74
00:07:51,300 --> 00:07:53,600
- Yeah...I'm sorry dude. I'm...

75
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:55,700
Thank you for picking me up

76
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,800
Seriously

77
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,700
I'm fucking, I'm very chocked right now.

78
00:07:59,700 --> 00:08:02,900
- I know, I saw you knocking it back.

79
00:08:04,300 --> 00:08:06,300
- I know, I know

80
00:08:08,200 --> 00:08:10,200
Yeah, I don't know why I drink so much

81
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:13,600
Lizzy's stuff again

82
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:15,200
- Yeah
- Yeah

83
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:17,700
- Of course
- I know. It's just...

84
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,000
It's so hard to get along anymore,
you know.

85
00:08:21,100 --> 00:08:23,600
I can't never do anything right obviously

86
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,500
and she can't do anything right

87
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,700
and we are never on the same page
and that just...

88
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:33,400
really, it's really makes me upset.

89
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,300
- Why? Something happenned?

90
00:08:38,400 --> 00:08:39,600
- Hmmm...

91
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:44,700
I don't know

92
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:52,400
- You know that...
that doesn't make any sense to me

93
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:54,100
because

94
00:08:54,600 --> 00:08:58,700
Lizzy seems like the type of girl 
who gets you

95
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,500
she is so...

96
00:09:04,100 --> 00:09:05,600
cool and...

97
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,200
pretty and...nice
- Yeah

98
00:09:09,400 --> 00:09:12,600
- She is like...perfect

99
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:16,500
- Hey Aaron, she is like perfect exactly
and just...

100
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:19,300
I...

101
00:09:21,500 --> 00:09:22,700
I don't know.

102
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:27,700
She's perfect...and yet...

103
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:33,700
It's so hard to say but

104
00:09:33,700 --> 00:09:37,500
I really want it anymore?

105
00:12:42,300 --> 00:12:46,200
- You mind tell me why you parked out here
at this hour in the middle of nowhere?

106
00:12:46,700 --> 00:12:47,900
- Hmm...

107
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:54,100
Ah...Hmm...I'm really sorry officer, hmm..

108
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:56,500
I just...

109
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,500
I was... 

110
00:12:58,900 --> 00:13:00,600
I was at the party...

111
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:03,500
and...I...

112
00:13:03,500 --> 00:13:05,900
I, I had a few drinks...

113
00:13:06,100 --> 00:13:09,100
hmm...drink and...

114
00:13:11,000 --> 00:13:14,700
I...I just pulled over to get some sleep.

115
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:19,700
- Right

116
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:22,700
- I...I'm sorry. I...I...

117
00:13:32,500 --> 00:13:35,100
- See you in an hour.
Sleep it off.

118
00:13:36,500 --> 00:13:39,000
If I get a call a truck
will be here in the morning

119
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,000
and I'm not going to be happy

120
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:43,100
- Okay...okay

121
00:13:43,400 --> 00:13:46,500
I'm...I'm really sorry officer...sir

122
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:49,200
Thank you...sorry...sorry

123
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,000
- Tell your friend on the back seat
to put some clothe on, okay?

124
00:14:46,600 --> 00:14:48,100
- James...

125
00:14:56,600 --> 00:14:58,100
Fuck it!

126
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:24,100
- Am I supposed to mention how worried I am?

127
00:17:30,700 --> 00:17:32,600
- You can mention it

128
00:17:33,700 --> 00:17:35,500
- I'm fucking worried

129
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,400
- I know

130
00:17:40,100 --> 00:17:42,200
- So, what are you going to do about it?

131
00:17:43,800 --> 00:17:46,300
- Sometimes there is nothing
you can do

132
00:17:49,300 --> 00:17:51,300
- You know that's not true

133
00:18:42,500 --> 00:18:44,000
- What are you doing in here?

134
00:18:50,100 --> 00:18:51,400
- Hey

135
00:18:52,500 --> 00:18:53,700
- Aaron

136
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:58,700
What the hell are you doing in here?

137
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:05,100
-I...think...Wait!

138
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,600
- Hey, Lizzy
- Hi

139
00:19:38,300 --> 00:19:40,400
- So, what's up James?

140
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:45,200
Lizzy?

141
00:19:47,000 --> 00:19:48,300
- Aaron...

142
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,200
 how have you been?

143
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:54,100
- Pretty shitty, to be honest.

144
00:19:55,400 --> 00:19:58,900
So tired. Just been driving around all night.

145
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:05,600
- I know, that's...it sounds terrible

146
00:20:05,800 --> 00:20:07,300
I'm sorry

147
00:20:07,400 --> 00:20:08,800
- Yeah, it sucks

148
00:20:09,300 --> 00:20:10,900
whatever...though...

149
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:13,200
I'll be fine...I'll be fine.

150
00:20:14,900 --> 00:20:16,200
Maybe...

151
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:18,200
- Crazy to hear though

152
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:21,800
I didn't expect to see you at the door

153
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:25,300
- Yeah, I haven't seen you in a while

154
00:20:26,800 --> 00:20:28,500
What have you been up to?

155
00:20:33,200 --> 00:20:34,900
- Not much really

156
00:20:35,500 --> 00:20:37,000
Just been...

157
00:20:38,700 --> 00:20:40,200
really busy

158
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:43,900
and tired and stuff, you know...

159
00:20:49,300 --> 00:20:52,400
I was seeing someone, actually

160
00:20:52,900 --> 00:20:54,100
-Really?

161
00:20:56,100 --> 00:20:57,300
She's cute?

162
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:00,900
- Yeah, for sure

163
00:21:01,700 --> 00:21:03,200
- How was Mikaela?

164
00:21:03,200 --> 00:21:05,200
- She is great.

165
00:21:06,700 --> 00:21:08,200
Just busy with work

166
00:21:08,300 --> 00:21:11,400
- I'm on...I'll be back,
wait there, it'll take a second...

167
00:21:12,700 --> 00:21:15,400
- Okay...
- Me too

168
00:21:16,100 --> 00:21:17,000
- Bye

169
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:26,100
- Are you okay?

170
00:21:27,700 --> 00:21:29,700
- Yeah

171
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:32,300
I'm just tired

172
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:35,300
Sort of trying to straighten up, okay?

173
00:21:35,700 --> 00:21:37,400
- To straighten up who, what?

174
00:21:37,700 --> 00:21:38,700
- Hmm...

175
00:21:41,400 --> 00:21:42,900
Nothing

176
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,500
- Nothing...

177
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,500
Oh, you just let me know that
you're okay

178
00:21:55,900 --> 00:21:57,100
- Fine
- Okay, okay, okay

179
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:58,900
I'm sorry, I'm sorry, sorry, sorry

180
00:22:02,800 --> 00:22:04,200
I'm sorry

181
00:22:05,500 --> 00:22:07,000
I'm gay anyway

182
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,000
Can you please just stay?

183
00:22:11,300 --> 00:22:13,300
- I'm gonna be in a better mood?

184
00:22:14,800 --> 00:22:16,700
- Probably not, no.

185
00:22:18,100 --> 00:22:19,800
Please don't go, please...

186
00:22:19,800 --> 00:22:22,200
- I don't go, I...I don't wanna go

187
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:24,900
- Good

188
00:22:25,100 --> 00:22:27,700
- Can you just...trying to fucking
kill me, are you?

189
00:22:50,500 --> 00:22:52,100
I'm not a push over,

190
00:22:54,400 --> 00:22:57,200
I'm not gonna be here for you all the time

191
00:22:57,900 --> 00:22:59,300
especially

192
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:02,200
if you are uncapable of letting me in.

193
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:05,700
So...

194
00:23:08,100 --> 00:23:09,800
just keep hiding from me and

195
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,900
eventually I'm stopping in your way

196
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:16,100
Do you understand that?

197
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:22,300
- I can't believe you came here

198
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:28,900
- James...

199
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:34,000
I didn't forget anything that happened
- No, I was out of head

200
00:24:42,200 --> 00:24:43,800
I'm sorry. I...

201
00:24:45,300 --> 00:24:47,900
I dont wanna talk,
I dont wanna think, okay?

202
00:24:47,900 --> 00:24:50,500
- You can't pretend like this
doesn't exist.

203
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,300
I see you,

204
00:24:59,800 --> 00:25:01,400
I hope you see me

205
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:02,700
- Aaron,

206
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:07,100
you have to know
how this works

207
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:11,700
- James if you walk out of your...
- Get out...please

208
00:25:12,700 --> 00:25:15,900
- I...
- Aaron...please...

209
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:20,900
just fucking move.

210
00:25:58,700 --> 00:26:00,900
- Hey, what's up?
How are you?

211
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:37,600
- Don't you guy feel like
we are fucking crazy?

212
00:26:42,600 --> 00:26:46,400
Do you wonder what would be like
if things were different?

213
00:26:50,100 --> 00:26:52,200
Things can be different

214
00:27:03,900 --> 00:27:06,000
I hate this fucking town.

215
00:27:19,500 --> 00:27:22,100
- Did you have any suspect?
- Yeah

216
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:28,800
- Why?

217
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:35,600
Why Lizzy?

218
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:38,100
- Aaron, I don't know what you think...

219
00:27:38,100 --> 00:27:44,000
- Lizzy, did James ever tell you
he cheated on you or you just guessed...

220
00:27:44,000 --> 00:27:45,900
- I...I know, can you just not do...
- He cheated on you!

221
00:27:45,900 --> 00:27:49,500
- I know and if you can just not do this 
right now that would be really great

222
00:28:02,500 --> 00:28:04,500
- Are you mad at me?

223
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,800
- That's not fair

224
00:28:13,400 --> 00:28:15,000
Maybe...

225
00:28:15,900 --> 00:28:17,700
maybe we should go to bed.

226
00:28:21,400 --> 00:28:23,400
Maybe you should go

227
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:26,900
- I'm sorry, Aaron

228
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:32,200
Why are you doing this?

229
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:35,200
- Why are you doing this?
