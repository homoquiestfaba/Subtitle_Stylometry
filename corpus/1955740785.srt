Animals are trying

Mmm, do I like fish sticks!

16
00:01:33,761 --> 00:01:35,763
I could eat them
all day long.

17

Lemme tell ya,
I just gotta say...

18
00:01:37,390 --> 00:01:39,225
It's time to get moving...

19
00:01:39,225 --> 00:01:41,686
Yes, it might hurt
a little bit...

20

27
00:01:57,618 --> 00:01:58,911
Today I saw five lizards...

28
00:01:58,911 --> 00:02:00,663
A family of air purification
and regulation panels...

29
00:02:00,663 --> 00:02:02,081
All you need is love...

30
00:02:02,081 --> 00:02:02,707
What? What?...

31
00:02:03,249 --> 00:02:04,292
Anybody got a light?...

32
00:02:04,292 --> 00:02:05,460
There's nothing I can do...

33
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:06,627
Nooo. Nooo. Nooo.

God is watching you
and he's shaking his head...

38
00:02:15,011 --> 00:02:16,512
Two for the price of one...

39
00:02:16,512 --> 00:02:18,181
Read my bad poetry...

40
00:02:18,181 --> 00:02:19,474

But I want iiiiit!...

42
00:02:23,102 --> 00:02:25,855
The saddest part,
she had no idea...

43
00:02:25,855 --> 00:02:28,232
Those stars are billions
of years old...

44

The saddest part,
she had no idea...

45

I'm sorry... I'm sorry...

49
00:02:36,491 --> 00:02:37,909
Sit still and do what you're told!...

50
00:02:37,909 --> 00:02:38,993
Where's my hat?...

51
00:02:38,993 --> 00:02:41,204
If I smile, everything will be okay!...

52
00:02:41,204 --> 00:02:43,080
Stop following me!...

53
00:02:43,998 --> 00:02:45,583
My career is on the fast track...

54
00:02:45,583 --> 00:02:46,834
When you're good you watch TV...

55
00:02:46,834 --> 00:02:48,085
If you set your mind to it,
you can do anything!...

56
00:02:48,503 --> 00:02:49,962
That's not what I said!...

57
00:02:50,254 --> 00:02:51,589
I'm gonna sue you!...

58
00:02:52,924 --> 00:02:54,217

I am not your dogfood pony...

62
00:02:59,722 --> 00:03:01,182
That's just what they
want you to believe...

63
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:02,975
Well that's just too bad...

64
00:03:03,142 --> 00:03:05,353
It won't last, it never does...

65
00:03:05,353 --> 00:03:06,646
Let go of my leg!...

66
00:03:06,646 --> 00:03:08,064

You could tie the child down,
with a secure rope or chain...

71
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:24,997
Stop touching me...

72
00:03:25,581 --> 00:03:26,833
Stop touching me!
