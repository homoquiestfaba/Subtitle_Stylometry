00:10:31,931 --> 00:10:34,000
I said, "Well, this is
the way it's supposed to be."

167
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,468
Easiest thing
in the world, right?

168
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,438
Yeah! I was arrogant.

169
00:10:38,438 --> 00:10:41,908
What the hell did I know,
that most Major Leaguers
never get a shot like that?

170
00:10:43,009 --> 00:10:44,377
I waited all my life for that.

171
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,312
That's what I'm sayin'.

172
00:10:46,312 --> 00:10:47,947
What?

173
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:52,218
Joey...
You're gonna do it.

174
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:59,058
I won a batting title once.
Most Valuable Player once.

175
00:10:59,058 --> 00:11:02,061
But when you're an athlete,
you play to win.

176
00:11:02,061 --> 00:11:03,429
Win.

177
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:06,065
In baseball, that means
the World Series.

178
00:11:06,065 --> 00:11:09,068
I played 2,209
baseball games,

179
00:11:09,068 --> 00:11:11,070
and never made it
to the World Series.

180
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:16,009
I managed 1,901 games,
and never made it
to the World Series.

181
00:11:16,009 --> 00:11:18,211
I played 18 years as a player,

182
00:11:18,211 --> 00:11:20,213
19 years as a manager,

183
00:11:20,213 --> 00:11:22,115
never made it
to the World Series.

184
00:11:22,115 --> 00:11:23,950
Some guy looked it up,
and it turns out

185
00:11:23,950 --> 00:11:27,220
that I'm the one who spent
more days in a baseball uniform

186
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:30,123
than anyone else in
the history of the game...

187
00:11:30,123 --> 00:11:32,158
who never made it
to the World Series.

188
00:11:32,158 --> 00:11:35,395
Now, how the hell
would you like to have
that on your epitaph?

189
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,309
[softly]
You know, this is not just
some kid with a couple years,

190
00:11:49,309 --> 00:11:52,345
that's your boy--
this is Dwight Gooden, skipper.

191
00:11:52,345 --> 00:11:53,780
Dwight Gooden!
Yeah, I know.

192
00:11:53,780 --> 00:11:56,449
Was he a great pitcher?
Yeah, sure.

193
00:11:56,449 --> 00:11:59,319
Was he a great pitcher?
This is what I got to know.

194
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:01,821
Well, this is one
of the premier pictures
of all times.

195
00:12:01,821 --> 00:12:05,325
Yeah, I know what.
Listen: what about
the drug suspensions?

196
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:08,228
He's clean now.
You know this?

197
00:12:08,228 --> 00:12:11,798
Absolutely.
Hmm.

198
00:12:11,798 --> 00:12:13,566
You know, he hasn't pitched
in a year and a half.

199
00:12:13,566 --> 00:12:18,271
Joe, this is a guy
that really wants
to make it back.

200
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:22,141
Bottom line, Joe T.
The boss wants this guy.

201
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,510
Are you going
to use him or not?

202
00:12:39,425 --> 00:12:41,294
Don't worry about it, Doc.
It's only spring training.

203
00:12:44,263 --> 00:12:46,265
[bat hits ball]

204
00:12:55,041 --> 00:12:58,778
All right.
Still spring training.
There's two weeks to go.

205
00:13:05,551 --> 00:13:07,787
You'll get him next time.
It's only spring training.

206
00:13:11,591 --> 00:13:14,327
I've lost Mélido Pérez.
He's gone for the season.

207
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:21,601
Jimmy Key has had surgery.
It takes a whole year
to come back from that one.

208
00:13:21,601 --> 00:13:24,504
Kenny Rogers is banged
all over the place.

209
00:13:24,504 --> 00:13:26,639
And Andy Pettitte
is inexperienced,

210
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,208
and that is four out of
my five starting pitchers.

211
00:13:29,208 --> 00:13:30,643
What about Doc Gooden?

212
00:13:30,643 --> 00:13:32,445
Doc Gooden.

213
00:13:32,445 --> 00:13:34,447
He's a good pitcher,
isn't he?

214
00:13:34,447 --> 00:13:36,582
1986, he was a great pitcher.

215
00:13:36,582 --> 00:13:39,585
How they going?

216
00:13:39,585 --> 00:13:41,354
Great. Almost ready.

217
00:13:41,354 --> 00:13:43,890
Not the hamburgers,
the team!

218
00:13:43,890 --> 00:13:46,092
Great.

219
00:13:46,092 --> 00:13:48,294
Almost ready.

<i>luck gonna do 'em?</i>

229
00:14:14,921 --> 00:14:18,191
Wasn't exactly
a great pre-season, Joe.
Pre-season's for football.

230
00:14:18,191 --> 00:14:21,694
It's spring training,
that's all it is.
Not any more, Joe.

231
00:14:21,694 --> 00:14:24,430
So, are the Yankees
ready for the season?

232
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:27,500
Well, we're about
to find out, aren't we?

Focus, man.

240
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:52,592
They're pretty upset, Joe.
Better talk to 'em.

How's your arm, Doc?

243
00:15:05,404 --> 00:15:08,541
It's fine, and you?
Good. Real good.

244
00:15:08,541 --> 00:15:10,543
We'll get it back.

245
00:15:14,580 --> 00:15:16,349

246
00:15:16,349 --> 00:15:17,683
Yeah?

247
00:15:17,683 --> 00:15:20,186
You played some
football in college, right?

248
00:15:20,186 --> 00:15:22,522
Yeah, some.

249
00:15:22,522 --> 00:15:25,591
How many games
in a football season?

250
00:15:25,591 --> 00:15:29,295
Twelve.

251
00:15:29,295 --> 00:15:30,997
How many games
in a baseball season?

252
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:33,266
A hundred and sixty-two.

253
00:15:39,739 --> 00:15:43,476
Joe's right, boys.
We got more games,
let's get the focus back!

254
00:15:43,476 --> 00:15:45,011
Let's dig in!

255

[chattering]

256
00:15:46,779 --> 00:15:48,314
Come on!

257
00:15:48,314 --> 00:15:51,017
Joe? Joe.
Telephone.

258
00:15:51,017 --> 00:15:52,618
Yeah, would you tell him
I'll call him back, Zim?

259
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:54,954

00:16:15,508 --> 00:16:17,376

No, no, no, I meant
you, your family.

265
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:23,382
You settled in,
got a nice place?

266
00:16:23,382 --> 00:16:25,418
<i> Lovely place.</i>
And there are no problems,

267
00:16:25,418 --> 00:16:27,486
because, uh,
if there are...

268
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:30,590
No, not at all, George.
<i> And no distractions,</i>

Nothing.
<i> Well, that's all I want</i>
<i> to know, Joe.</i>

271
00:16:38,798 --> 00:16:41,801
[beeps]
You know what's wrong.
We haven't got any hitters!

272
00:16:41,801 --> 00:16:44,403
You're the trading genius.
Why can't you get me
any hitters?

273
00:16:44,403 --> 00:16:46,606
We've got hitters,
Mr. Steinbrenner.
That's not the problem.

274
00:16:46,606 --> 00:16:49,575
If you're looking for 
an area where you want
to make personnel changes,

275
00:16:49,575 --> 00:16:51,844
you've got to consider the fact
that in our last four losses,

276
00:16:51,844 --> 00:16:54,080
we gave up six, seven,
eight, and ten runs!

277
00:16:54,080 --> 00:16:56,449
Unless we get some
pitching help, we've got
to find some hitters!

278
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:59,385
If you're gonna give up
that many runs, you got
to score runs!

279
00:16:59,385 --> 00:17:01,120
A lot of them!

280
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:05,124
Where's all
these olives come from?
Are these Greek olives,

281
00:17:05,124 --> 00:17:06,559
or Italian ones?
[Woman] No, no, no, no.
Italian.

282
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:07,827
These are Italian olives.
You sure?

283
00:17:07,827 --> 00:17:10,563
Has it got a lot
of salt in there?
Kalamata?

284
00:17:10,563 --> 00:17:13,099
All right,
what's this all about?

285
00:17:13,099 --> 00:17:14,800
Beats the hell out of me.
I didn't call this meeting.

286
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:17,436
Joey, this is
not a meeting.

287
00:17:17,436 --> 00:17:19,605
All right,
so it's not a meeting.
But what's it all about?

288
00:17:19,605 --> 00:17:21,307
Yeah, Rae.
What is it all about?

289
00:17:21,307 --> 00:17:24,110
It's about your brother.
Frank? What did he do?

290
00:17:24,110 --> 00:17:27,747
He didn't do anything.
Why isn't he here?

291
00:17:27,747 --> 00:17:29,815
He's in Florida!

292
00:17:29,815 --> 00:17:33,586
Exactly... and
why is he in Florida?

293
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,621
Uh, because he lives there?

294
00:17:35,621 --> 00:17:38,691
[laughs]
With his brother managing
a baseball team

295
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:41,427
practically across
the street from where
he has an apartment!

296
00:17:41,427 --> 00:17:43,729
He doesn't want to get
in my hair! It's very
thoughtful of him.

297
00:17:43,729 --> 00:17:46,899
A-Are we talking about
the same brother here?
Come on, please!

298
00:17:46,899 --> 00:17:49,635
Ah, this is crazy.
Come on, hey,
gimme a break!

299
00:17:49,635 --> 00:17:51,804
So pick up the phone,
and ask him why he's there!
Yeah!

300
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:55,508
You guys, listen
to your sister.

301
00:17:57,710 --> 00:17:59,345
[Rae]
Thank you.

302
00:17:59,345 --> 00:18:01,480
Now, Frankie lives
for baseball, right?

303
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:03,549
Yeah.
Every time there's a game,

304
00:18:03,549 --> 00:18:06,152
he calls you
whether you are playing,
whether you are managing,

305
00:18:06,152 --> 00:18:08,654
whether you are broadcasting--
whatever, right?

306
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,391
Has he been calling you?

307
00:18:12,391 --> 00:18:14,594
No.

308
00:18:18,898 --> 00:18:23,369
How soon can you go?
Soon as is humanly possible.

309
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:27,773
[booing]

310
00:18:34,947 --> 00:18:37,650
Let's call it
a night, Doc.

311
00:18:37,650 --> 00:18:39,752
Don't know what's the matter.
The ball's straight.

312
00:18:39,752 --> 00:18:42,955
Stays up.
It's a long road.

313
00:18:42,955 --> 00:18:44,790
We're gonna need you.

314
00:18:57,670 --> 00:18:59,739
He'll come around.

315
00:19:08,214 --> 00:19:10,416
[knocks]
Joe?

316
00:19:10,416 --> 00:19:12,718
Doc! Come on in,
have a seat, will you?

317
00:19:22,561 --> 00:19:25,431
Doc, it's only temporary
until you get it worked out,

318
00:19:25,431 --> 00:19:27,566
but for now, I got to
pull you out of the rotation.

319
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:30,836
You'll work out of
the bullpen for a while,
low pressure situations,

320
00:19:30,836 --> 00:19:33,572
it'll come around.

321
00:19:36,242 --> 00:19:38,778
You know, I--

322
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:42,715
I have eighteen long months
to think about how bad
I screwed up my life,

323
00:19:42,715 --> 00:19:46,452
you know,
I let my dad down,

324
00:19:46,452 --> 00:19:48,854
and when I got that
suspension letter--

325
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:50,589
You know, I just kind
of bottomed out,

326
00:19:50,589 --> 00:19:52,758
I really got down,
and I was just kind of numb.

327
00:19:52,758 --> 00:19:54,860
Then I said to myself,
"I can make it back."

328
00:19:54,860 --> 00:19:57,863
You are back.
You're in the major leagues.

329
00:19:57,863 --> 00:19:59,932
You just gotta do
a little more work.

330
00:19:59,932 --> 00:20:03,035
I threw all last year, Joe.

331
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:08,474
I threw all winter,
getting ready to come back,
and my arm is fine, Joe.

332
00:20:08,474 --> 00:20:10,810
It's just um...

333
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:13,979
It's just--

334
00:20:13,979 --> 00:20:17,483
Just--
It's just not there.

335
00:20:18,751 --> 00:20:22,888
Don't give up.
Don't give up on yourself.

336
00:20:32,832 --> 00:20:35,801
Hey, Joe. Come here.

337
00:20:35,801 --> 00:20:37,770
I want you
to see something.

338
00:20:39,605 --> 00:20:42,641
This is Doc in '85,
and this is him now.

339
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,977
Now, I been looking at these
over and over again,

340
00:20:44,977 --> 00:20:46,912
tryin' to see
what's different.

341
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:49,648
I can't find anything.

342
00:20:51,750 --> 00:20:55,688
Yeah.

343
00:20:55,688 --> 00:20:57,790
I don't know what
the problem is, Joe.

344
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,326
Well, maybe
that's the problem.

345
00:21:00,326 --> 00:21:04,029
He is trying to do
what he did when he was 21.

346
00:21:04,029 --> 00:21:07,767
Can you imagine if
we tried to do the stuff
that we did when we were 21?

347
00:21:07,767 --> 00:21:10,536
[grunts]
Good night.
Get some sleep, pal.

348
00:21:12,605 --> 00:21:14,740
Yeah.

349
00:21:30,055 --> 00:21:32,591
Hey, Doc?

350
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:34,360
Like you to try something.

351
00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:36,729
I want to see if
we can eliminate some of
the parts of your motion.

352
00:21:36,729 --> 00:21:38,697
Like, simplify it.

353
00:21:38,697 --> 00:21:40,699
Bring your hands up slowly.

354
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:43,836
No, no, no.
Not that high. Down.

355
00:21:43,836 --> 00:21:46,372
Good, good.
Now pull back a bit.

356
00:21:46,372 --> 00:21:49,375
All right.
You okay there?
Mm-hmm.

357
00:21:49,375 --> 00:21:51,610
All right.
Try a couple.

358
00:21:56,115 --> 00:21:58,817
How'd that feel?

359
00:21:58,817 --> 00:22:01,053
Good.
Good?

360
00:22:01,053 --> 00:22:03,856
[laughs]
All right, here.
There you go.

361
00:22:05,391 --> 00:22:07,626
Throw a couple more.

362
00:22:17,903 --> 00:22:19,338
Oh!

363
00:22:37,056 --> 00:22:39,925
Hey, Frankie.
Hey, Rae!

364
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:41,827
How are ya?
[laughs]

365
00:22:41,827 --> 00:22:44,163
I got a little dizzy
for a second. I'm fine.

366
00:22:44,163 --> 00:22:45,164
Oh!
You all right?

367
00:22:45,164 --> 00:22:47,800
Yeah, hey. No problem.
Hey!

368
00:22:47,800 --> 00:22:49,668
Come on, let's get
a cup of coffee.

369
00:22:49,668 --> 00:22:51,036
How are you?
I'm good.

370
00:22:51,036 --> 00:22:53,072
You look beautiful.
You always look beautiful.

371
00:22:53,072 --> 00:22:55,007
Ahh!
Well, you do. Come on!

372
00:22:55,007 --> 00:22:58,811
[cheering]

373
00:22:58,811 --> 00:23:01,847
<i>[Announcer]</i>
<i>It'll be a 2-2 to Tartabull.</i>
<i>Struck him out swinging!</i>

374
00:23:01,847 --> 00:23:03,816
<i>Breaking ball away!</i>
<i>Well, Coney's been great today.</i>

375
00:23:03,816 --> 00:23:05,985
<i> I think that's gonna</i>
<i> do it for him.</i>

376
00:23:05,985 --> 00:23:08,921
<i> Ends with 12 strikeouts!</i>
<i> He looked phenomenal</i>
<i> today out there.</i>

377
00:23:11,790 --> 00:23:14,159
Great game, Coney.

378
00:23:14,159 --> 00:23:17,463
I don't know where
we would be without you.

379
00:23:17,463 --> 00:23:19,932
How long has
this been this way?
Not long, Joe.

380
00:23:19,932 --> 00:23:22,935
What does that
feel like?

381
00:23:22,935 --> 00:23:25,771
It's okay. Doesn't hurt.

382
00:23:25,771 --> 00:23:29,742
Which is it?
Doesn't hurt? Or okay?

383
00:23:29,742 --> 00:23:32,044
What do you mean?

384
00:23:32,044 --> 00:23:33,946
Can you feel
what I'm doing?

385
00:23:33,946 --> 00:23:36,015
Yeah, you're moving
my fingers.

386
00:23:36,015 --> 00:23:38,017
Honest answer, Coney.

387
00:23:42,488 --> 00:23:44,056
[sighs]

388
00:23:44,056 --> 00:23:46,225
After about
the fourth inning or so,

389
00:23:46,225 --> 00:23:48,227
sometimes later, I guess,

390
00:23:48,227 --> 00:23:50,829
I can't feel
my fingers at all.

391
00:23:50,829 --> 00:23:52,965
So this isn't
the first time it's happened.

392
00:23:52,965 --> 00:23:57,036
Last couple of games.
Goes away in about an hour.

393
00:23:57,036 --> 00:23:59,705
I shook his hand.
It was ice.

394
00:24:10,883 --> 00:24:13,018
Ready, Joe.

395
00:24:20,893 --> 00:24:24,863
I must have done something
right in a previous life.

396
00:24:24,863 --> 00:24:27,199
I have never seen
two more beautiful women.

397
00:24:30,269 --> 00:24:33,138
Did you hear that?
I guess he likes your dress.

398
00:24:34,840 --> 00:24:36,875
[chuckling]

399
00:24:36,875 --> 00:24:39,745
What were you thinking about?

400
00:24:39,745 --> 00:24:41,113
When?

401
00:24:41,113 --> 00:24:44,750
Just now.
When I walked in.

402
00:24:44,750 --> 00:24:46,218
You looked so lost.

403
00:24:46,218 --> 00:24:50,322
Well, I was lost,
and then you came in,

404
00:24:50,322 --> 00:24:52,558
and how could I be lost?

405
00:24:52,558 --> 00:24:55,994
[coos]
Aw.

406
00:24:55,994 --> 00:24:58,063
That's such
a beautiful thing to say.

407
00:24:58,063 --> 00:25:00,299
I read it somewhere.
[chuckles]

408
00:25:00,299 --> 00:25:02,534
[laughing]

409
00:25:08,207 --> 00:25:11,176
[phone ringing]

410
00:25:14,046 --> 00:25:15,914
[yawns]

411
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:18,050
Hello?

412
00:25:18,050 --> 00:25:19,351
<i> Ali, it's Rae.</i>

413
00:25:19,351 --> 00:25:21,353
<i> Is Joe there?</i>
<i> Can I talk to him?</i>

414
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:24,123
Um, well,
he's still sleeping.

415
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:26,024
He didn't get in
till 2:00 a.m.

416
00:25:26,024 --> 00:25:28,227
I hate to wake him up.
He's not been
sleeping very well.

417
00:25:28,227 --> 00:25:31,196
It's kind of important, Ali.

418
00:25:33,832 --> 00:25:36,168
Okay.

419
00:25:36,168 --> 00:25:37,803
Joe?

420
00:25:37,803 --> 00:25:39,872
It's Rae.
She says it's important.

421
00:25:39,872 --> 00:25:42,141
What?
It's Rae.
She's on the phone.

422
00:25:42,141 --> 00:25:43,609
Oh.

423
00:25:46,078 --> 00:25:48,080
Hello, Rae.
What's the matter?

424
00:25:49,948 --> 00:25:52,351
Frank's sick.

425
00:25:52,351 --> 00:25:56,288
He won't go see a doctor,
and I can't get him
to do anything about it.

426
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:58,624
Put him on.

427
00:25:58,624 --> 00:26:00,292
<i> He does not know</i>
<i> that I'm calling you.</i>

428
00:26:00,292 --> 00:26:01,960
It's okay.
Put him on.

429
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:03,962
Oh.

430
00:26:09,101 --> 00:26:10,836
Frank?
Hmm?

431
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:12,838
It's Joe.
He wants to talk to you.

432
00:26:12,838 --> 00:26:13,972
Ohh.

433
00:26:13,972 --> 00:26:15,974
This another one
of your brainstorms?

434
00:26:15,974 --> 00:26:18,077
What brainstorms?
This is your brother.

435
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:20,078
Your brother who loves you?

436
00:26:20,078 --> 00:26:21,980
He wants to talk to you.

437
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:23,415
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

438
00:26:23,415 --> 00:26:25,417
Hey, Joe, how you doing?

439
00:26:25,417 --> 00:26:27,252
Go to a doctor.

440
00:26:27,252 --> 00:26:29,888
<i> Yeah. Hey, how about</i>
<i> that game last night, huh?</i>

441
00:26:29,888 --> 00:26:32,658
This Cone--
hell of a pitcher.

442
00:26:32,658 --> 00:26:34,893
Where the hell would you be
without him?

443
00:26:34,893 --> 00:26:37,663
Well, we're about to find out.
He's got a problem
with his hand.

444
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:41,033
Yeah? Is it serious?

445
00:26:41,033 --> 00:26:43,869
<i> I don't know if it's serious,</i>

446
00:26:43,869 --> 00:26:46,305
<i> but I do know that he's got</i>
<i> enough sense to go</i>
<i> and see a doctor.</i>

447
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:48,307
What are you doing, Frank?

448
00:26:48,307 --> 00:26:50,342
What the hell are you doing?

449
00:26:50,342 --> 00:26:52,344
Hey, Joey, thanks.

450
00:26:52,344 --> 00:26:55,881
I really appreciate it.
I'm busy right now.

451
00:26:55,881 --> 00:26:57,382
What the--
<i> Bye.</i>

452
00:26:57,382 --> 00:26:59,051
I love ya.

453
00:27:05,090 --> 00:27:07,159
[sighs]

454
00:27:07,159 --> 00:27:08,994
[players chattering]
Fellas.

455
00:27:08,994 --> 00:27:11,296
Everybody, listen up.

456
00:27:12,898 --> 00:27:15,367
Joe's got something
he needs to tell ya.

457
00:27:15,367 --> 00:27:17,903
All right.
First things first.

458
00:27:17,903 --> 00:27:20,439
I want you to hear it from me
before you hear it
from anybody else.

459
00:27:20,439 --> 00:27:22,207
Coney needs surgery.

460
00:27:22,207 --> 00:27:24,009
Oh, come on.

461
00:27:24,009 --> 00:27:26,912
He's got an aneurysm
in his pitching shoulder.

462
00:27:26,912 --> 00:27:30,249
We hear "aneurysm,"
we get scared,
but it's not like that.

463
00:27:30,249 --> 00:27:32,484
It's not life-threatening.
He's gonna have
the surgery this week,

464
00:27:32,484 --> 00:27:34,486
and it's all gonna
get taken care of,

465
00:27:34,486 --> 00:27:37,489
so we have nothing
to worry about on that score.

466
00:27:37,489 --> 00:27:40,158
I think I only
have to say this once,

467
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,361
'cause I know you all know it.

468
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:45,264
This is a 25-man game.

469
00:27:45,264 --> 00:27:49,067
Will it be harder to win
without Coney? Absolutely.

470
00:27:49,067 --> 00:27:52,938
Which means each
and every one of you
has to pull that much harder.

471
00:27:52,938 --> 00:27:54,940
So let's not waste
time and energy

472
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:57,376
lamenting on
what we don't have.

473
00:27:57,376 --> 00:28:00,946
Let's concentrate
on what we do have--

474
00:28:00,946 --> 00:28:03,015
each other.

475
00:28:03,015 --> 00:28:04,283
Yeah.
Right.

476
00:28:04,283 --> 00:28:06,285
You got it, Coach.
You got it.

477
00:28:06,285 --> 00:28:08,353
All for one.
That's right.

478
00:28:08,353 --> 00:28:10,289
All right, guys, let's go!
All for one!

479
00:28:10,289 --> 00:28:12,758
Let's go play.
Let's go have fun!
Come on!

480
00:28:15,527 --> 00:28:17,529
[chattering]

481
00:28:17,529 --> 00:28:19,231
Come on, come on.

482
00:28:19,231 --> 00:28:21,366
Go back, back.

483
00:28:21,366 --> 00:28:23,368
Doc.

484
00:28:23,368 --> 00:28:25,237
What's up?

485
00:28:25,237 --> 00:28:27,506
Feel like starting tomorrow?

486
00:28:27,506 --> 00:28:30,042
Yeah. Where? Columbus?

487
00:28:30,042 --> 00:28:32,077
I need somebody
to start tomorrow
against Seattle.

488
00:28:32,077 --> 00:28:34,112
It's yours if you want it.

489
00:28:37,249 --> 00:28:39,217
Yeah.

490
00:28:43,522 --> 00:28:45,123
[chuckles]

491
00:28:58,236 --> 00:29:00,238
[sighs]

492
00:29:07,045 --> 00:29:08,747
[grunts]

493
00:29:14,386 --> 00:29:16,288
[grunts]

494
00:29:20,559 --> 00:29:23,195
Let's hope
he can pitch like that
with his clothes on.

495
00:29:23,195 --> 00:29:25,764
Shh, shh, shh,
shh, shh! Shh!

496
00:29:38,844 --> 00:29:41,046
I don't know
what to do, Joe.

497
00:29:42,581 --> 00:29:45,317
I mean, if this is gonna be
his last hours,

498
00:29:45,317 --> 00:29:48,053
I think I should
be there, right?

499
00:29:48,053 --> 00:29:50,055
Have you talked to him?

500
00:29:50,055 --> 00:29:52,324
I didn't know
what to tell him.

501
00:29:52,324 --> 00:29:56,194
I just kind of wanted
to make up my mind first.

502
00:29:57,329 --> 00:29:59,798
I mean, he always said
that if...

503

[stifled crying]

504
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:13,211
He said he never wanted me
to lose my turn.

505
00:30:13,211 --> 00:30:15,847
So...

506
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:24,823

Dad, it's Dwight.
How you doing?

511
00:30:46,511 --> 00:30:50,649
'Cause you know
I'll be on the next flight.

512
00:30:50,649 --> 00:30:53,852
Because I'd like
to be there with you,
that's why.

513
00:30:57,355 --> 00:30:59,124
Right.

514
00:31:02,194 --> 00:31:03,862
Right.

515
00:31:05,931 --> 00:31:07,632
Okay. Right.

516
00:31:07,632 --> 00:31:09,568
First thing in the morning.

517
00:31:11,536 --> 00:31:13,538
I love you.

518
00:31:20,145 --> 00:31:23,515
He says, uh, the operation
is first thing in the morning.

519
00:31:23,515 --> 00:31:25,550
They're gonna give him
something to sleep,

520
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:27,686
and he'll be knocked out
all night,

521
00:31:27,686 --> 00:31:30,555
and he don't want me
sitting in some hospital room
looking at him.

522
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:34,292
Well, you knew
what he would say.

523
00:31:36,561 --> 00:31:39,197
You know,

524
00:31:39,197 --> 00:31:41,299
when I messed up,

525
00:31:41,299 --> 00:31:44,903
the thing that hurt me most
was the hurt I caused him.

526
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:52,511
Uh, yeah.

527
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:55,313
I knew he would say that.

528
00:31:57,415 --> 00:31:59,618
Then you're pitching for him.

529
00:32:08,059 --> 00:32:10,462
Is it time?
Yeah. It's time.

530
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,498
Oh.

some good offense now.

[laughs, winces]

1317
01:18:15,758 --> 01:18:17,993
[laughing]

1318
01:18:17,993 --> 01:18:20,095
<i>[TV announcer]</i>
<i>There is no greater setting</i>

1319
01:18:20,095 --> 01:18:22,364
<i>for a World Series</i>
<i>than Yankee Stadium.</i>

1320
01:18:22,364 --> 01:18:25,200
<i>The Yankees have won</i>
<i>22 World Championships</i>

1321
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,336
<i>and they are poised</i>
<i>for number 23</i>

1322
01:18:27,336 --> 01:18:30,406
<i>in front of a jam-packed</i>
<i>Yankee Stadium crowd.</i>

1323
01:18:30,406 --> 01:18:33,375
<i>This is really</i>
<i>the Home Office for baseball.</i>
[crowd going wild]

1324
01:18:33,375 --> 01:18:37,012
<i>It's all set up right here,</i>
<i>the Yankees are one out away.</i>

1325
01:18:37,012 --> 01:18:39,481
<i>[2nd TV announcer]</i>
<i>One out away, but Wetteland</i>
<i>has a tough out,</i>

1326
01:18:39,481 --> 01:18:42,218
<i>with the tying and</i>
<i>go-ahead runs on base.</i>

1327
01:18:42,218 --> 01:18:43,986
<i>Facing Mark Lemke.</i>

1328
01:18:43,986 --> 01:18:46,121
<i>It'll be a 2-2 pitch</i>
<i>to Lemke,</i>

1329
01:18:46,121 --> 01:18:48,791
<i>as Wetteland deals--</i>
<i>popped him up!</i>

1330
01:18:48,791 --> 01:18:51,994
<i>Off-third foul!</i>
<i>Does Hayes have a play?</i>

1331
01:18:51,994 --> 01:18:54,997
<i>Hayes toward the dugout--</i>
<i>Hayes reaching in...</i>

1332
01:18:54,997 --> 01:18:57,132
<i>and he can't make the catch!</i>

1333
01:18:57,132 --> 01:18:59,301
<i>As Hayes falls down</i>
<i>in the Braves' dugout.</i>

1334
01:18:59,301 --> 01:19:02,304
[crowd groans]
<i>The Yankees were</i>
<i>three inches away</i>

1335
01:19:02,304 --> 01:19:04,340
<i>from winning</i>
<i>the World Series!</i>

1336
01:19:04,340 --> 01:19:07,543
<i>Now Lemke gets</i>
<i>another crack at it.</i>

1337
01:19:07,543 --> 01:19:10,245
<i> Well, that's</i>
<i> baseball etiquette.</i>

1338
01:19:10,245 --> 01:19:12,548
<i> Nobody was</i>
<i> helping Charlie Hayes</i>
<i> in that Braves' dugout,</i>

1339
01:19:12,548 --> 01:19:14,550
<i> and now they have to do it</i>
<i> all over again.</i>

1340
01:19:14,550 --> 01:19:16,218
That guy can give you
a heart attack.

1341
01:19:16,218 --> 01:19:18,153
Hector, would you
shut the hell up!

1342
01:19:18,153 --> 01:19:19,488
I'm sorry.

1343
01:19:19,488 --> 01:19:22,291
<i>[TV announcer]</i>
<i>What drama. They were so close,</i>

1344
01:19:22,291 --> 01:19:24,526
<i>a couple of inches away,</i>
<i>and they would have</i>

1345
01:19:24,526 --> 01:19:29,298
<i>won the World Series,</i>
<i>and now Wetteland has to</i>
<i>throw at least one more pitch.</i>

1346
01:19:36,238 --> 01:19:38,240
[player]
Come on, Johnny!

1347
01:19:38,240 --> 01:19:43,312
Ten years ago,
I was one out away from
winning the World Series, Dunc.

1348
01:19:43,312 --> 01:19:45,047
I can't take it,
I can't take it!

1349
01:19:49,585 --> 01:19:51,487
Give it to him!

1350
01:19:53,489 --> 01:19:55,491
Come on!

1351
01:19:55,491 --> 01:19:58,193
What do you think?
He's gonna get him out
with this next pitch.

1352
01:20:00,062 --> 01:20:02,331
<i>And Wetteland deals to Lemke--</i>
<i>swing, and he popped him up!</i>

1353
01:20:02,331 --> 01:20:04,299
Get it, son, get it!

1354
01:20:04,299 --> 01:20:07,569
<i>The ball's in foul territory.</i>
<i>Will this one stay in play?</i>

1355
01:20:07,569 --> 01:20:12,074
<i>Hayes, waiting.</i>
<i>Charlie Hayes waiting</i>
<i>for the ball to come down.</i>

1356
01:20:23,218 --> 01:20:25,387
[cheering]

1357
01:21:36,558 --> 01:21:38,560
Yeaahhhh!
