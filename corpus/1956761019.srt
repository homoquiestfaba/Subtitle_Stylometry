1
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:06,525
Get out!

2
00:01:09,194 --> 00:01:10,988
Get outta here.

3
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:19,328
What have we here?

4
00:01:19,329 --> 00:01:21,205
They ain't no use to us.

5
00:01:21,206 --> 00:01:23,624
Might as well send
'em on their way.

7
00:01:23,625 --> 00:01:27,211
Oh, I can think of
a couple of uses.

9
00:01:27,212 --> 00:01:31,550
Get him up.

10
00:01:39,057 --> 00:01:43,144
Get him on his knees.

11
00:01:43,145 --> 00:01:45,647
Put your hand up on the log.

12
00:01:51,194 --> 00:01:54,698
I'm not gonna ask you again.

13
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:05,541
Hold on here.

14
00:02:05,542 --> 00:02:07,126
Let's get back to the job, huh?

15
00:02:07,127 --> 00:02:12,591
I give the orders around here.

17
00:02:21,099 --> 00:02:22,558
You stole a bag of money.

18
00:02:22,559 --> 00:02:23,726
I'm here to get it back.

19
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,519
That money is owed to us.

20
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,898
Don't you interrupt me
again, boy.

22
00:02:28,899 --> 00:02:30,024
Now where's the money?

23
00:02:30,025 --> 00:02:35,738
We used it all.

24
00:02:35,739 --> 00:02:41,243
Get his hand back up there.

25
00:02:41,244 --> 00:02:42,662
You got nine more chances at

26
00:02:42,663 --> 00:02:43,829
the truth before I get your

27
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,123
manhood up here on this log.

28
00:02:46,124 --> 00:02:47,625
I told you, we...

29
00:02:47,626 --> 00:02:49,877
We buried it by the river.

30
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:52,213
I'll show you. Just stop.

31
00:02:52,214 --> 00:02:54,215
I'll show you.

32
00:02:54,216 --> 00:03:01,972
Finally, someone honest.

33
00:03:01,973 --> 00:03:03,391
Take care of that snot-nosed kid

34
00:03:03,392 --> 00:03:09,647
or you won't be gettin' paid.

35
00:03:09,648 --> 00:03:12,525
No one's touchin' the kid.

36
00:03:12,526 --> 00:03:14,944
I may be a lotta things,

37
00:03:14,945 --> 00:03:21,325
but kid killer ain't one of 'em.

38
00:03:21,326 --> 00:03:22,743
You ride into town, you don't

39
00:03:22,744 --> 00:03:23,953
stop for anything, not until

40
00:03:23,954 --> 00:03:28,749
you get to the sheriff.

41
00:03:28,750 --> 00:03:31,919
It's over.

42
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,337
It's over.

43
00:03:33,338 --> 00:03:35,423
Comes with the territory,

44
00:03:35,424 --> 00:03:37,049
amigo. You've seen plenty worse.

45
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,217
Besides, you don't know anything

46
00:03:38,218 --> 00:03:40,052
else but killin'.

47
00:03:40,053 --> 00:03:42,471
Not anymore.

48
00:03:42,472 --> 00:03:46,768
It's over.

49
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:02,701
Good morning,
ladies and gentlemen

51
00:04:02,702 --> 00:04:05,619
thank you all for coming.

52
00:04:05,620 --> 00:04:07,621
My name is Charles Howard.

53
00:04:07,622 --> 00:04:08,873
I represent the company that's

54
00:04:08,874 --> 00:04:10,458
building this railroad.

55
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:14,253
We are days away from
your property lines.

57
00:04:14,254 --> 00:04:16,088
As you can see, these green

58
00:04:16,089 --> 00:04:17,506
parcels here are the ones we've

59
00:04:17,507 --> 00:04:18,632
secured so far.

60
00:04:18,633 --> 00:04:20,342
But as you can also see from

61
00:04:20,343 --> 00:04:21,802
this map, this is the route that

62
00:04:21,803 --> 00:04:23,804
the lay of the land forces us to

63
00:04:23,805 --> 00:04:27,308
follow,
right up to the Prescott ranch.

65
00:04:27,309 --> 00:04:30,352
Now, everyone has been

66
00:04:30,353 --> 00:04:33,147
cooperative up to now, except

67
00:04:33,148 --> 00:04:36,025
for you and Mr. Prescott,

68
00:04:36,026 --> 00:04:38,861
and I very much want
to get this settled.

70
00:04:38,862 --> 00:04:40,279
We agreed to meet with you

71
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:42,448
here today because we believe

72
00:04:42,449 --> 00:04:44,867
our property is worth more than

73
00:04:44,868 --> 00:04:47,495
your offer, Mr. Howard.

74
00:04:47,496 --> 00:04:48,871
I think there's some things

75
00:04:48,872 --> 00:04:55,085
that you don't quite understand.

76
00:04:55,086 --> 00:04:58,756
What do you say, Mr. Prescott?
Please?

78
00:04:58,757 --> 00:05:00,674
Full-time job, huh?

79
00:05:00,675 --> 00:05:02,885
Yes, sir, Mr. Prescott.

80
00:05:02,886 --> 00:05:05,013
You're a good
worker, I know that.

82
00:05:05,014 --> 00:05:07,556
Yes, sir.

83
00:05:07,557 --> 00:05:08,724
We work here from sunup to

84
00:05:08,725 --> 00:05:11,101
dark, you know what, too.

85
00:05:11,102 --> 00:05:12,853
Yes, sir.

86
00:05:12,854 --> 00:05:15,105
This ain't no place for a
boy, ya know.

88
00:05:15,106 --> 00:05:17,066
No, sir.

89
00:05:17,067 --> 00:05:19,485
What wage you expectin'?

90
00:05:19,486 --> 00:05:20,945
Wage?

91
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,198
You can't just work here for
food, ya know.

93
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,075
You're askin' for a man's
job, man's work.

95
00:05:26,076 --> 00:05:27,493
You don't figure on workin' for

96
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:29,161
nothin', do ya?

97
00:05:29,162 --> 00:05:32,248
No, sir. But...
Ten dollars a month.

99
00:05:32,249 --> 00:05:35,125
When you got it.

100
00:05:35,126 --> 00:05:38,212
Ten dollars a month,
when you got it.

102
00:05:38,213 --> 00:05:40,089
Ten dollars?!

103
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:45,803
Good men are hard to
find, Thurmond.

105
00:05:45,804 --> 00:05:47,763
And he's already had one offer.

106
00:05:47,764 --> 00:05:53,018
I'd say you better
hire him quick.

108
00:05:53,019 --> 00:05:55,646
I hadn't thought about that.

109
00:05:55,647 --> 00:05:56,814
Well, you can start by takin'

110
00:05:56,815 --> 00:05:59,233
the curry to the big bay.

111
00:05:59,234 --> 00:06:03,530
Go ahead, scoot!

112
00:06:18,545 --> 00:06:20,004
Do you understand the concept

113
00:06:20,005 --> 00:06:21,380
of eminent domain?

114
00:06:21,381 --> 00:06:22,798
The government can seize any

115
00:06:22,799 --> 00:06:24,216
property it deems necessary

116
00:06:24,217 --> 00:06:25,634
for the greater good of the

117
00:06:25,635 --> 00:06:27,386
country, and the railroad is

118
00:06:27,387 --> 00:06:30,306
for the greater
good of the country.

120
00:06:30,307 --> 00:06:33,100
A man's land just
can't be taken.

122
00:06:33,101 --> 00:06:34,435
The government can have

123
00:06:34,436 --> 00:06:35,769
a judge rule that your land

124
00:06:35,770 --> 00:06:37,396
must be given to the railroad.

125
00:06:37,397 --> 00:06:38,814
I can guarantee you that that

126
00:06:38,815 --> 00:06:40,274
price will be a lot lower than

127
00:06:40,275 --> 00:06:41,692
the one I'm offering you

128
00:06:41,693 --> 00:06:42,985
and Mr. Prescott right now.

129
00:06:42,986 --> 00:06:44,153
You people have until tomorrow

130
00:06:44,154 --> 00:06:46,405
morning to make a decision.

131
00:06:46,406 --> 00:06:48,073
Or what? We know you just

132
00:06:48,074 --> 00:06:49,575
hired Mr. Tate and his men,

133
00:06:49,576 --> 00:06:51,910
and we're prepared to do what

134
00:06:51,911 --> 00:06:56,541
we must to defend
ourselves and our land.

136
00:06:59,586 --> 00:07:01,170
Don't do this.

137
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:02,796
Please just let him go.

138
00:07:02,797 --> 00:07:04,506
The boy's not a part of this.

139
00:07:04,507 --> 00:07:05,925
We asked you nicely to leave

140
00:07:05,926 --> 00:07:08,302
twice now,
but you are still here.

142
00:07:08,303 --> 00:07:09,887
This is my husband's land.

143
00:07:09,888 --> 00:07:15,809
You can't just... I can't what?

145
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,936
Only thing you understand is

146
00:07:17,937 --> 00:07:21,899
when it's beaten into ya.

147
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:25,278
Oh, god.

148
00:07:27,489 --> 00:07:29,990
God, please stop.

149
00:07:29,991 --> 00:07:31,158
We'll stop when you tell me

150
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:35,330
where I can find your husband.

151
00:07:45,340 --> 00:07:48,967
He's working at eagle's pass.

152
00:07:48,968 --> 00:07:52,638
Now that wasn't hard, was it?

153
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:57,519
Go on, go see your boy.

154
00:08:42,772 --> 00:08:44,273
Hi, Luke.

155
00:08:44,274 --> 00:08:47,317
Morning.

156
00:08:47,318 --> 00:08:49,194
We're almost finished here.

157
00:08:49,195 --> 00:08:50,362
Railroad surveyors don't seem to

158
00:08:50,363 --> 00:08:52,656
get that we're not movin' and

159
00:08:52,657 --> 00:08:54,116
they ain't welcome.

160
00:08:54,117 --> 00:08:56,160
How'd Noah do?

161
00:08:56,161 --> 00:09:00,707
Real good.

162
00:09:40,705 --> 00:09:44,000
( Horse whinnies )

163
00:10:46,104 --> 00:10:50,984
We warned you, mister.

164
00:10:58,157 --> 00:11:02,245
Hard to find good men.

165
00:11:07,250 --> 00:11:12,880
Get down there and
finish the job.

167
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:18,135
Make it look like
Indians did this.

169
00:11:18,136 --> 00:11:21,346
( Men yelling )

170
00:11:21,347 --> 00:11:23,348
I can see why he didn't wanna

171
00:11:23,349 --> 00:11:28,187
let this place go.

172
00:11:28,188 --> 00:11:29,105
Mr. Riley, I'm delighted to

173
00:11:29,106 --> 00:11:30,522
meet you, but I don't quite

174
00:11:30,523 --> 00:11:32,065
understand why you're here.

175
00:11:32,066 --> 00:11:33,734
Well, my law firm specializes

176
00:11:33,735 --> 00:11:35,402
in these types of negotiations.

177
00:11:35,403 --> 00:11:36,570
When Chicago was concerned about

178
00:11:36,571 --> 00:11:40,324
your progress,
they contracted me.

180
00:11:40,325 --> 00:11:43,410
Now, what's the situation with

181
00:11:43,411 --> 00:11:47,080
these three parcels
of land right here?

183
00:11:47,081 --> 00:11:48,498
I just spoke with the owners,

184
00:11:48,499 --> 00:11:51,043
and those parcels
are now in hand.

186
00:11:51,044 --> 00:11:54,004
Good.
And where's they survey camp?

188
00:11:54,005 --> 00:11:56,173
My survey camp is here.

189
00:11:56,174 --> 00:11:57,341
Now, I understand a Mr.

190
00:11:57,342 --> 00:12:00,135
Prescott has your offer.

191
00:12:00,136 --> 00:12:01,595
For the better part of a year

192
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:03,639
now, but he won't budge.

193
00:12:03,640 --> 00:12:07,101
Hm. I'd like to talk to him.

194
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:20,030
You're leaving oak
hill to Luke and Monty?

196
00:12:20,031 --> 00:12:22,491
I am.

197
00:12:22,492 --> 00:12:24,743
What's goin' on?

198
00:12:24,744 --> 00:12:26,161
Well, if anything should

199
00:12:26,162 --> 00:12:28,497
happen to me, I don't want there

200
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:30,207
to be any doubt as to what

201
00:12:30,208 --> 00:12:32,584
should be done with oak hill.

202
00:12:32,585 --> 00:12:34,753
Does Luke know?

203
00:12:34,754 --> 00:12:36,630
No. Neither does Monty.

204
00:12:36,631 --> 00:12:38,048
And there's no need for them

205
00:12:38,049 --> 00:12:41,093
to know unless
something happens to me.

207
00:12:41,094 --> 00:12:43,095
Why're you givin' this to me?

208
00:12:43,096 --> 00:12:46,765
For safe keepin'.

209
00:12:46,766 --> 00:12:47,933
Nothin's gonna happen to you,

210
00:12:47,934 --> 00:12:50,769
right, Thurmond?

211
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,898
Too damn stubborn
to die on us anyway.

213
00:12:54,899 --> 00:12:59,070
Don't you worry about me.

214
00:13:38,818 --> 00:13:41,236
I'll do the talkin'.

215
00:13:41,237 --> 00:13:43,155
Man from Chicago in?

216
00:13:43,156 --> 00:13:45,282
Got in this morning.

217
00:13:45,283 --> 00:13:46,491
Just what we needed.

218
00:13:46,492 --> 00:13:47,701
Let's be clear, Tate.

219
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:49,411
I'm not happy he's here either.

220
00:13:49,412 --> 00:13:50,704
But for now, you let him do

221
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:51,788
things the way he wants to.

222
00:13:51,789 --> 00:13:53,332
Where do you want him?

223
00:13:53,333 --> 00:13:55,876
Take him up and
talk to Prescott.

225
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,253
What about these other
three homesteaders?

227
00:13:58,254 --> 00:13:59,838
They want more money.

228
00:13:59,839 --> 00:14:01,256
We took care of the last

229
00:14:01,257 --> 00:14:02,175
family just north of them

230
00:14:02,176 --> 00:14:03,550
this morning; I could do the

231
00:14:03,551 --> 00:14:04,885
same to those three.

232
00:14:04,886 --> 00:14:05,969
No. Not now. You need to keep

233
00:14:05,970 --> 00:14:07,429
Riley occupied with Prescott

234
00:14:07,430 --> 00:14:09,264
and outta my hair.

235
00:14:09,265 --> 00:14:10,515
What if these homesteaders

236
00:14:10,516 --> 00:14:11,808
hold out, and this Riley fella

237
00:14:11,809 --> 00:14:13,352
catches wind of it?

238
00:14:13,353 --> 00:14:14,270
I don't know, but until I do

239
00:14:14,271 --> 00:14:15,979
know, I need your eye on Riley

240
00:14:15,980 --> 00:14:17,272
at all times.

241
00:14:17,273 --> 00:14:18,191
I don't need Washington and

242
00:14:18,192 --> 00:14:19,524
Chicago coming down on me

243
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:20,859
any more than they have already.

244
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:22,319
So for now, what he says goes

245
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:23,237
until I say otherwise.

246
00:14:23,238 --> 00:14:25,155
Is that understood?

247
00:14:25,156 --> 00:14:27,157
Yes, sir.

248
00:14:27,158 --> 00:14:28,575
Mr. Riley, I'd like you to

249
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:32,537
meet my best foreman, Mr. Tate.

250
00:14:32,538 --> 00:14:36,083
It's a pleasure to meet you.

251
00:14:36,084 --> 00:14:37,542
Mr. Tate will take you out to

252
00:14:37,543 --> 00:14:39,294
the survey camp.

253
00:14:39,295 --> 00:14:41,713
Um, have you spoken to

254
00:14:41,714 --> 00:14:43,173
Mr. Prescott recently?

255
00:14:43,174 --> 00:14:44,925
We had a little disagreement

256
00:14:44,926 --> 00:14:46,843
a couple of days ago.

257
00:14:46,844 --> 00:14:48,011
The survey can't wait for

258
00:14:48,012 --> 00:14:50,639
Mr. Prescott to
come to his senses.

260
00:14:50,640 --> 00:14:51,807
That's why I'm here, Mr.

261
00:14:51,808 --> 00:14:53,016
Howard.

262
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,309
In my absence, Mr. Riley,

263
00:14:54,310 --> 00:14:55,769
obviously you speak for the

264
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,313
railroad,
and Mr. Tate here works for you.

266
00:14:58,314 --> 00:14:59,481
Yes, that's the way it was

267
00:14:59,482 --> 00:15:00,857
explained to me as well.

268
00:15:00,858 --> 00:15:02,025
And by the way, we're down a

269
00:15:02,026 --> 00:15:03,360
man. Can you get a replacement?

270
00:15:03,361 --> 00:15:04,402
I have someone in mind.

271
00:15:04,403 --> 00:15:07,240
Good. Let's go then.

272
00:15:23,422 --> 00:15:26,883
How the hell did he
get his britches off?

274
00:15:26,884 --> 00:15:33,141
This is the great D.C. cracker?

276
00:15:48,614 --> 00:15:50,657
Are you in?

277
00:15:50,658 --> 00:15:52,284
( Scoffs )

278
00:15:52,285 --> 00:15:58,081
Let's see 'em.

279
00:15:58,082 --> 00:15:59,499
Well, this is a far cry from

280
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:03,837
Chicago, isn't it?

281
00:16:03,838 --> 00:16:09,718
I forgot...
Anything could be so peaceful.

283
00:16:09,719 --> 00:16:13,388
Yeah, sand storms, rattlesnakes.

285
00:16:13,389 --> 00:16:15,432
Freezin' cold and furnace heat.

286
00:16:15,433 --> 00:16:16,600
If you're a mile from town,

287
00:16:16,601 --> 00:16:18,268
you're a guaranteed dead man.

288
00:16:18,269 --> 00:16:21,771
Ain't my idea of peaceful.

289
00:16:21,772 --> 00:16:25,400
That's interesting, Mr. Tate.

290
00:16:25,401 --> 00:16:28,195
You hate this land so much,

291
00:16:28,196 --> 00:16:30,614
but yet, you stay.

292
00:16:30,615 --> 00:16:32,574
I'm a railroad man.

293
00:16:32,575 --> 00:16:34,826
Railroad's comin' here.

294
00:16:34,827 --> 00:16:38,413
Ya know, it's my job to

295
00:16:38,414 --> 00:16:41,458
handle this Prescott
matter peacefully.

297
00:16:41,459 --> 00:16:42,834
Meanin'?

298
00:16:42,835 --> 00:16:44,252
There's no need for a man

299
00:16:44,253 --> 00:16:45,295
like D.C. cracker.

300
00:16:45,296 --> 00:16:47,881
You ain't never met Prescott.

301
00:16:47,882 --> 00:16:49,507
I have.

302
00:16:49,508 --> 00:16:50,926
He starts wavin' that shotgun of

303
00:16:50,927 --> 00:16:52,719
his around again, I want me

304
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,308
a little insurance.

305
00:16:58,309 --> 00:17:04,023
I suggest you get some
sleep, men.

307
00:17:24,752 --> 00:17:27,797
Mrs. Prescott.

308
00:17:47,608 --> 00:17:49,150
Mornin', Luke.

309
00:17:49,151 --> 00:17:50,360
Mornin', Noah.

310
00:17:50,361 --> 00:17:51,528
Here's your coffee.

311
00:17:51,529 --> 00:17:52,904
Thanks.

312
00:17:52,905 --> 00:17:54,072
Well, chores are done, sun's

313
00:17:54,073 --> 00:17:56,575
up. You ready to go?

314
00:17:56,576 --> 00:17:58,493
Go? Where?

315
00:17:58,494 --> 00:18:00,161
Where? Hunting, of course.

316
00:18:00,162 --> 00:18:03,290
You told me yesterday... Sh, sh.

318
00:18:03,291 --> 00:18:04,624
Mr. Prescott sleepin'?

319
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,042
Rifle and shells are on the

320
00:18:06,043 --> 00:18:07,627
kitchen table, but hush up now,

321
00:18:07,628 --> 00:18:09,045
or we'll both end up doin'

322
00:18:09,046 --> 00:18:13,009
chores. All right.

323
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:27,856
Mr. Cracker.

324
00:18:27,857 --> 00:18:31,860
Mr. Cracker.

325
00:18:31,861 --> 00:18:33,653
Mr. Cracker.

326
00:18:33,654 --> 00:18:36,823
( Groans )

327
00:18:36,824 --> 00:18:40,410
You want some coffee?

328
00:18:40,411 --> 00:18:42,162
Where am I?

329
00:18:42,163 --> 00:18:43,496
Just outside of Nogales.

330
00:18:43,497 --> 00:18:46,166
The railroad survey camp.

331
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:48,418
You came aboard last night.

332
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:52,882
With a little help.

333
00:18:59,180 --> 00:19:02,641
Thank you.

334
00:19:02,642 --> 00:19:05,435
Who the hell are you?

335
00:19:05,436 --> 00:19:07,937
My name's Riley.

336
00:19:07,938 --> 00:19:10,398
Jess Riley.

337
00:19:10,399 --> 00:19:13,068
I'm leading the survey crew,

338
00:19:13,069 --> 00:19:15,904
clearin' the way for
the track layers. Oh.

340
00:19:15,905 --> 00:19:19,574
You know why you're here?

341
00:19:19,575 --> 00:19:21,659
You're here for protection.

342
00:19:21,660 --> 00:19:23,078
You're not to use that gun

343
00:19:23,079 --> 00:19:24,621
unless I tell you to do so.

344
00:19:24,622 --> 00:19:28,667
Is that perfectly clear?

345
00:19:35,508 --> 00:19:39,261
Yeah.

346
00:19:44,225 --> 00:19:46,142
Mount up.

347
00:19:46,143 --> 00:19:47,560
I wanna see where Mr. Prescott's

348
00:19:47,561 --> 00:19:51,482
land begins.

349
00:20:06,497 --> 00:20:09,708
He's the one that hired you,

350
00:20:09,709 --> 00:20:11,793
but I'm management, which means

351
00:20:11,794 --> 00:20:14,212
I'm his boss and yours.

352
00:20:14,213 --> 00:20:18,801
You take orders only from me.

353
00:20:31,147 --> 00:20:34,649
You ever shoot
jackrabbits before?

355
00:20:34,650 --> 00:20:36,151
Once or twice.

356
00:20:36,152 --> 00:20:39,028
When?
I never seen you shoot nothin'.

358
00:20:39,029 --> 00:20:41,906
A long time ago.

359
00:20:41,907 --> 00:20:46,077
Monty says they
taste like chicken.

361
00:20:46,078 --> 00:20:49,415
Maybe Montana chicken.

362
00:21:00,342 --> 00:21:04,638
Cut 'em.

363
00:21:11,103 --> 00:21:13,563
Excuse me. Mr. Marsh,

364
00:21:13,564 --> 00:21:16,191
I don't believe I told you...

365
00:21:16,192 --> 00:21:20,571
Whoa, whoa, hold your fire.

366
00:21:23,574 --> 00:21:24,991
You're a little partial to

367
00:21:24,992 --> 00:21:26,701
trespassin' on other people's

368
00:21:26,702 --> 00:21:30,873
property, ain't you?

369
00:21:42,885 --> 00:21:47,181
Put your guns away, gentlemen.

370
00:21:55,189 --> 00:21:57,899
I ain't seen you before.

371
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,652
My name's Riley. Jess Riley.

372
00:22:00,653 --> 00:22:02,111
And I'm here to stop any more

373
00:22:02,112 --> 00:22:05,448
problems between you
and the railroad.

375
00:22:05,449 --> 00:22:06,783
That ain't hard.

376
00:22:06,784 --> 00:22:08,576
Just stay off my property.

377
00:22:08,577 --> 00:22:09,702
Riley's here to talk,

378
00:22:09,703 --> 00:22:10,912
Prescott. I suggest you listen

379
00:22:10,913 --> 00:22:13,540
while you still can.

380
00:22:13,541 --> 00:22:15,416
And who are you?

381
00:22:15,417 --> 00:22:17,085
Name's cracker.

382
00:22:17,086 --> 00:22:19,379
D.C. cracker.

383
00:22:19,380 --> 00:22:22,632
You don't look like
no railroad man.

385
00:22:22,633 --> 00:22:25,927
Thank you very much, sir.

386
00:22:25,928 --> 00:22:28,513
Well, get on with it.

387
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:30,056
What?

388
00:22:30,057 --> 00:22:32,725
Your speech... about how I'm

389
00:22:32,726 --> 00:22:34,185
standin' in the way of progress.

390
00:22:34,186 --> 00:22:36,771
You seem to know it pretty well.

392
00:22:36,772 --> 00:22:39,732
Ought to.
I've heard it enough times.

394
00:22:39,733 --> 00:22:40,651
This time, I'm prepared to

395
00:22:40,652 --> 00:22:43,111
make a substantial offer.

396
00:22:43,112 --> 00:22:44,862
I ain't interested.

397
00:22:44,863 --> 00:22:47,532
You haven't even heard it yet.

399
00:22:47,533 --> 00:22:48,700
Look, it all boils down to

400
00:22:48,701 --> 00:22:50,118
one thing... me movin' off my

401
00:22:50,119 --> 00:22:52,912
land, don't it?

402
00:22:52,913 --> 00:22:54,414
Yes, sir, that's right.

403
00:22:54,415 --> 00:22:57,584
Then we got nothin'
more to talk about.

405
00:22:57,585 --> 00:22:59,043
So what you're sayin' is that

406
00:22:59,044 --> 00:23:01,546
you won't move, so the railroad

407
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,339
just has to stop.

408
00:23:03,340 --> 00:23:06,968
I spent 30 years in this land.

410
00:23:06,969 --> 00:23:08,595
You reckon that's not important?

411
00:23:08,596 --> 00:23:10,179
Why are you wastin' time?

412
00:23:10,180 --> 00:23:11,764
They're just a bunch of ignorant

413
00:23:11,765 --> 00:23:17,604
dirt farmers.

414
00:23:17,605 --> 00:23:18,646
You're a likeable fella,

415
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:22,984
Mr. Riley,
and I appreciate your offer.

417
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:26,112
But you all can go now, 'cause

418
00:23:26,113 --> 00:23:32,244
we got nothin'
more to talk about.

420
00:24:09,657 --> 00:24:17,205
Stop it, damn it. Stop it!

421
00:24:17,206 --> 00:24:19,374
Ya know, for such

422
00:24:19,375 --> 00:24:21,209
a reasonable man, Mr. Riley,

423
00:24:21,210 --> 00:24:24,754
you sure do promote
a hell of a brawl.

425
00:24:24,755 --> 00:24:27,423
How you doin'?

426
00:24:27,424 --> 00:24:31,553
Better than you, I reckon.

427
00:24:39,561 --> 00:24:43,731
I'm riding into Nogales.

428
00:24:43,732 --> 00:24:48,237
Talk to you later, Mr. Prescott.

429
00:24:49,905 --> 00:24:51,948
Where the hell were you?

430
00:24:51,949 --> 00:24:55,243
They're just ignorant
dirt farmers.

432
00:24:55,244 --> 00:24:59,915
I thought you could handle it.

433
00:25:10,926 --> 00:25:16,806
You should've worn your gun.

434
00:25:16,807 --> 00:25:18,766
Things sure have changed.

435
00:25:18,767 --> 00:25:24,397
It's a changin' world.

436
00:25:24,398 --> 00:25:28,986
Yeah.

437
00:25:37,870 --> 00:25:40,872
Raise it up a little more.

438
00:25:40,873 --> 00:25:42,290
A little more. The other side's

439
00:25:42,291 --> 00:25:43,916
perfect. Right there.

440
00:25:43,917 --> 00:25:46,879
Yes, yes. Perfect. Very good.

441
00:26:01,894 --> 00:26:07,231
Newest depot office
west of Chicago.

443
00:26:07,232 --> 00:26:10,735
You must be Howard's
new man from Chicago.

445
00:26:10,736 --> 00:26:12,028
You can tell?

446
00:26:12,029 --> 00:26:13,237
Few people out hereabouts

447
00:26:13,238 --> 00:26:14,864
where suits as elegant as yours.

448
00:26:14,865 --> 00:26:16,282
Butterfield's the name.

449
00:26:16,283 --> 00:26:17,867
Donald l.

450
00:26:17,868 --> 00:26:19,786
Jess Riley.

451
00:26:19,787 --> 00:26:21,871
I am the mayor of Nogales

452
00:26:21,872 --> 00:26:23,873
and it was I and a few of my

453
00:26:23,874 --> 00:26:25,917
civic-minded business associates

454
00:26:25,918 --> 00:26:27,668
went to Chicago several years

455
00:26:27,669 --> 00:26:29,003
back and asked that your

456
00:26:29,004 --> 00:26:31,130
railroad route through Nogales.

457
00:26:31,131 --> 00:26:33,466
We were gratified when our small

458
00:26:33,467 --> 00:26:35,134
town was chosen.

459
00:26:35,135 --> 00:26:36,552
Well, I'm sure that both you

460
00:26:36,553 --> 00:26:37,887
and the town are gonna prosper.

461
00:26:37,888 --> 00:26:39,597
I would like to offer to help

462
00:26:39,598 --> 00:26:41,641
you with the Prescott matter.

463
00:26:41,642 --> 00:26:43,100
I was out at his place this

464
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,936
morning. Is he gonna leave?

465
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:45,978
No.

466
00:26:45,979 --> 00:26:47,730
The only person he'll listen

467
00:26:47,731 --> 00:26:49,315
to is Luke rivers.

468
00:26:49,316 --> 00:26:51,025
Rivers.

469
00:26:51,026 --> 00:26:52,610
Prescott's man.

470
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:55,196
He showed up outta nowhere

471
00:26:55,197 --> 00:26:57,406
a couple of years ago.

472
00:26:57,407 --> 00:26:59,033
I think I met him today.

473
00:26:59,034 --> 00:27:03,121
The only person
Prescott will listen to.

475
00:27:03,122 --> 00:27:04,539
If he's the one I'm thinking

476
00:27:04,540 --> 00:27:07,041
of, I doubt he'll talk to me.

477
00:27:07,042 --> 00:27:09,168
Maybe not you, but you oughta

478
00:27:09,169 --> 00:27:11,587
look up Jo Tanner.

479
00:27:11,588 --> 00:27:13,464
Who's he?

480
00:27:13,465 --> 00:27:15,258
Not he. She.

481
00:27:15,259 --> 00:27:16,884
She owns the boardinghouse

482
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:18,261
in town, she's a teacher,

483
00:27:18,262 --> 00:27:19,846
got a good, level head on her.

484
00:27:19,847 --> 00:27:22,390
Might listen to you
if you can talk sense.

486
00:27:22,391 --> 00:27:24,225
And I don't mean to spread

487
00:27:24,226 --> 00:27:27,270
gossip, but she...
Where can I find her?

489
00:27:27,271 --> 00:27:28,437
The church is also the

490
00:27:28,438 --> 00:27:30,022
school; Just south of town if

491
00:27:30,023 --> 00:27:31,732
you go that way.

492
00:27:31,733 --> 00:27:33,568
I think I know where it is.

493
00:27:33,569 --> 00:27:34,819
Thank you.

494
00:27:34,820 --> 00:27:35,987
Anything else I can do for

495
00:27:35,988 --> 00:27:37,780
you, you let me know.

496
00:27:37,781 --> 00:27:39,323
Actually, I was hoping to

497
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,992
find a local man to help me with

498
00:27:40,993 --> 00:27:42,577
my books while I'm here. Do you

499
00:27:42,578 --> 00:27:44,078
know anybody?

500
00:27:44,079 --> 00:27:46,539
Look no further. I'm your man.

502
00:27:46,540 --> 00:27:48,749
All right. You start tomorrow.

504
00:27:48,750 --> 00:27:50,042
I am your humble servant.

505
00:27:50,043 --> 00:27:51,210
Thank you, sir.

506
00:27:51,211 --> 00:27:54,922
We had some trouble
out at Prescott's.

508
00:27:54,923 --> 00:27:57,300
Was I not clear?

509
00:27:57,301 --> 00:27:59,051
I told you to let Riley take the

510
00:27:59,052 --> 00:28:00,928
lead on this.

511
00:28:00,929 --> 00:28:02,805
He was.

512
00:28:02,806 --> 00:28:04,182
You're reckless.

513
00:28:04,183 --> 00:28:05,725
I get the job done.

514
00:28:05,726 --> 00:28:07,184
Yes, when you are free to do

515
00:28:07,185 --> 00:28:08,769
it, but with Riley reporting to

516
00:28:08,770 --> 00:28:11,480
Chicago,
you have to use more discretion.

518
00:28:11,481 --> 00:28:12,982
So you want me to roll over.

519
00:28:12,983 --> 00:28:14,525
You used to ride with rivers.

520
00:28:14,526 --> 00:28:16,903
Are you telling me
he can't be swayed?

522
00:28:16,904 --> 00:28:18,613
Rivers is an ornery cuss.

523
00:28:18,614 --> 00:28:20,031
He always was.

524
00:28:20,032 --> 00:28:22,366
You're not afraid of
him, are you?

526
00:28:22,367 --> 00:28:23,618
I ain't afraid of no one.

527
00:28:23,619 --> 00:28:24,911
What about the others?

528
00:28:24,912 --> 00:28:26,120
Monty isn't much, but with

529
00:28:26,121 --> 00:28:27,455
rivers backin' him, I suppose

530
00:28:27,456 --> 00:28:28,873
he's dangerous enough.

531
00:28:28,874 --> 00:28:30,625
Prescott's quick to the trigger

532
00:28:30,626 --> 00:28:31,959
for an old man.

533
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:34,337
The other one ain't
nothin' but a boy.

535
00:28:34,338 --> 00:28:35,755
You have to use the right

536
00:28:35,756 --> 00:28:37,089
kind of pressure on rivers.

537
00:28:37,090 --> 00:28:38,507
When he sees that, rivers will

538
00:28:38,508 --> 00:28:39,967
see it isn't worth it, and he'll

539
00:28:39,968 --> 00:28:41,802
move on, and without rivers,

540
00:28:41,803 --> 00:28:43,721
the others will fold.

541
00:28:43,722 --> 00:28:44,931
We'll hurt him good.

542
00:28:44,932 --> 00:28:46,682
All right, so do it,

543
00:28:46,683 --> 00:28:49,519
but when Riley is in town.

544
00:29:04,660 --> 00:29:06,077
It's her!

545
00:29:06,078 --> 00:29:07,037
I don't care who started it.

546
00:29:07,038 --> 00:29:11,666
I'm ending it.

547
00:29:11,667 --> 00:29:15,378
Miss Tanner?

548
00:29:15,379 --> 00:29:17,129
Harold, stop pullin' her

549
00:29:17,130 --> 00:29:19,924
hair, or I will have
your pa tan your hide.

551
00:29:19,925 --> 00:29:22,301
Miss Tanner,
my name's Jess Riley.

553
00:29:22,302 --> 00:29:23,844
I'm with the railroad.

554
00:29:23,845 --> 00:29:25,012
You wanna drive your track

555
00:29:25,013 --> 00:29:26,180
through my school, right?

556
00:29:26,181 --> 00:29:27,348
Actually, I'd like to talk

557
00:29:27,349 --> 00:29:29,267
about Luke rivers.

558
00:29:29,268 --> 00:29:30,393
If you went to him with

559
00:29:30,394 --> 00:29:33,896
a message, would he listen?

560
00:29:33,897 --> 00:29:35,940
Depends on the message.

561
00:29:35,941 --> 00:29:37,108
I understand that he wields

562
00:29:37,109 --> 00:29:38,609
a certain amount of influence

563
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:40,820
over Thurmond Prescott.

564
00:29:40,821 --> 00:29:42,405
I'd just like him to know

565
00:29:42,406 --> 00:29:44,031
that if he could persuade

566
00:29:44,032 --> 00:29:46,450
Prescott to move, he'd be

567
00:29:46,451 --> 00:29:49,161
generously remunerated.

568
00:29:49,162 --> 00:29:51,497
Go to hell, Mr. Riley.

569
00:29:51,498 --> 00:29:53,541
What happened?

570
00:29:53,542 --> 00:29:55,042
What's the matter?

571
00:29:55,043 --> 00:29:56,003
You're tryin' to use me to

572
00:29:56,004 --> 00:29:57,420
buy off Luke, that's what's the

573
00:29:57,421 --> 00:29:59,046
matter, and I have news for you.

574
00:29:59,047 --> 00:30:01,799
I won't be used,
and Luke can't be bought.

576
00:30:01,800 --> 00:30:02,967
I didn't mean to insult you

577
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,969
or Mr. Rivers. I'm sorry.

578
00:30:04,970 --> 00:30:06,137
I went to see Prescott this

579
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:08,389
morning, and I tried to settle

580
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,391
this matter peacefully, but

581
00:30:10,392 --> 00:30:13,102
before I knew it,
there was a brawl.

583
00:30:13,103 --> 00:30:15,104
It wasn't pleasant.

584
00:30:15,105 --> 00:30:16,689
These are the facts.

585
00:30:16,690 --> 00:30:18,399
The railroad is coming.

586
00:30:18,400 --> 00:30:20,609
Prescott must move.

587
00:30:20,610 --> 00:30:22,695
I sympathize with him.

588
00:30:22,696 --> 00:30:24,572
But we're talking about

589
00:30:24,573 --> 00:30:25,865
something that's bigger than

590
00:30:25,866 --> 00:30:29,368
both him or me.

591
00:30:29,369 --> 00:30:31,120
You're a schoolteacher.

592
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:32,872
You've studied history.

593
00:30:32,873 --> 00:30:34,457
You know that people's lives

594
00:30:34,458 --> 00:30:35,624
are often disrupted by new

595
00:30:35,625 --> 00:30:39,128
things, new ways.

596
00:30:39,129 --> 00:30:42,131
The railroad can
benefit thousands.

598
00:30:42,132 --> 00:30:43,966
It can't be stopped by one man,

599
00:30:43,967 --> 00:30:45,134
no matter how justified his

600
00:30:45,135 --> 00:30:47,219
position might be.

601
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:48,387
Do you think you'd feel that

602
00:30:48,388 --> 00:30:52,308
way if that one man were you.

603
00:30:52,309 --> 00:30:54,518
Honestly, I don't know.

604
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:57,188
Miss Tanner, I need your help.

606
00:30:57,189 --> 00:30:58,355
Someone has got to talk some

607
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:00,107
sense into Thurmond Prescott

608
00:31:00,108 --> 00:31:07,823
before something
terrible happens.

610
00:31:07,824 --> 00:31:10,659
I'll talk to Luke.

611
00:31:10,660 --> 00:31:12,369
Thank you.

612
00:31:12,370 --> 00:31:17,000
Good day, sir.

613
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:15,266
He's knocked out.

614
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:19,646
( Laughs )

615
00:32:25,443 --> 00:32:27,194
Where you goin'?

616
00:32:27,195 --> 00:32:29,530
Cracker! Yeah?

617
00:32:29,531 --> 00:32:35,120
I asked you where you're goin'.

619
00:32:43,712 --> 00:32:47,214
You want me to shoot him?

620
00:32:47,215 --> 00:32:53,012
No.

621
00:32:53,013 --> 00:32:57,475
I'll see you around then.

622
00:33:05,275 --> 00:33:08,235
Sir, after thinking it

623
00:33:08,236 --> 00:33:10,154
through, we will move...

624
00:33:10,155 --> 00:33:12,656
If you double your offer.

625
00:33:12,657 --> 00:33:14,366
Well, that is not what I was

626
00:33:14,367 --> 00:33:15,743
hoping to hear.

627
00:33:15,744 --> 00:33:17,244
If we are going to move,

628
00:33:17,245 --> 00:33:21,373
the money you have
offered is not enough.

630
00:33:21,374 --> 00:33:23,167
The way we see it, you're

631
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:27,338
running out of options and time.

632
00:33:27,339 --> 00:33:28,964
I see.

633
00:33:28,965 --> 00:33:30,299
We're serious, Mr. Howard.

634
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:36,306
Excuse me.
I have some work to do.

636
00:33:40,185 --> 00:33:44,189
Luke.

637
00:33:52,197 --> 00:33:57,243
I, uh, I been meanin' to...
I know.

639
00:33:57,244 --> 00:34:01,205
I know how it is.

640
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:03,457
I had a visitor today.

641
00:34:03,458 --> 00:34:05,794
A man named Riley
from the railroad.

643
00:34:05,795 --> 00:34:08,212
Yeah? We met.

644
00:34:08,213 --> 00:34:10,381
Yes.

645
00:34:10,382 --> 00:34:12,925
He said there was a brawl.

646
00:34:12,926 --> 00:34:16,762
I'm okay.

647
00:34:16,763 --> 00:34:18,389
This Riley fella,

648
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:20,099
he wants you to go talk to

649
00:34:20,100 --> 00:34:23,894
Thurmond about gettin' out.

650
00:34:23,895 --> 00:34:26,397
He claims he only wants peace.

651
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,316
A fair settlement.

652
00:34:29,317 --> 00:34:30,609
I believe him.

653
00:34:30,610 --> 00:34:33,279
Yeah? Well, he's crazy if

654
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:34,738
he thinks I can get Thurmond to

655
00:34:34,739 --> 00:34:39,577
listen to me.

656
00:34:49,087 --> 00:34:52,841
What is it?

657
00:35:04,269 --> 00:35:05,686
All right, out, out.

658
00:35:05,687 --> 00:35:09,064
Everybody out, 'cept you, Noah.

659
00:35:09,065 --> 00:35:16,071
Boil some water and
bring clean towels.

661
00:35:16,072 --> 00:35:19,992
Nothin's broken.

662
00:35:19,993 --> 00:35:24,205
He wants to talk to you, Luke.

663
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:45,517
What's the matter, Thurmond?

664
00:35:45,518 --> 00:35:48,437
Oh, Luke blames me for what

665
00:35:48,438 --> 00:35:56,195
happened to Monty.

666
00:35:56,196 --> 00:36:02,493
Know what I want, Luke?

667
00:36:02,494 --> 00:36:05,120
Anything, Monty. Name it.

668
00:36:05,121 --> 00:36:08,832
I've been thinkin'.

669
00:36:08,833 --> 00:36:13,504
Maybe I'll head on home.

670
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:16,423
Good idea.

671
00:36:16,424 --> 00:36:20,719
Leaves'll be turnin' soon.

672
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:25,349
Trout'll be bitin'.

673
00:36:25,350 --> 00:36:28,602
Ma's Berry pies.

674
00:36:28,603 --> 00:36:33,524
Keep on like that,
I might just tag along.

676
00:36:33,525 --> 00:36:37,737
I think I'll take a nap now.

677
00:36:43,493 --> 00:36:44,910
You're sure no one saw what

678
00:36:44,911 --> 00:36:47,204
you did to Prescott's man.

679
00:36:47,205 --> 00:36:49,873
Nope.

680
00:36:49,874 --> 00:36:51,625
So they got the message.

681
00:36:51,626 --> 00:36:53,293
Yeah, they got the message.

682
00:36:53,294 --> 00:36:55,963
Good.

683
00:36:55,964 --> 00:36:57,506
I have another job for you.

684
00:36:57,507 --> 00:36:58,966
Those three families have

685
00:36:58,967 --> 00:37:00,134
decided you're the one they'd

686
00:37:00,135 --> 00:37:04,305
rather deal with.

687
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:27,328
Rivers.

688
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:33,375
You wouldn't have
needed it if you had it.

690
00:37:33,376 --> 00:37:34,793
You come to brag about what

691
00:37:34,794 --> 00:37:36,211
you did to the boy?

692
00:37:36,212 --> 00:37:37,379
I'd kill a man before I'd

693
00:37:37,380 --> 00:37:38,839
rawhide him like that.

694
00:37:38,840 --> 00:37:40,257
You tell Tate his message has

695
00:37:40,258 --> 00:37:41,467
been delivered.

696
00:37:41,468 --> 00:37:44,595
Comin' here's my idea.

697
00:37:44,596 --> 00:37:46,013
You all of a sudden found

698
00:37:46,014 --> 00:37:47,514
religion, cracker?

699
00:37:47,515 --> 00:37:48,849
That's funny you said that.

700
00:37:48,850 --> 00:37:50,267
Just today I was thinkin' the

701
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:52,936
same thing about a
fella I once knew.

703
00:37:52,937 --> 00:37:54,688
Last I saw of him, he was ridin'

704
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:56,315
this big old roan horse,

705
00:37:56,316 --> 00:37:59,610
carryin' a nickel-plated Colt.

706
00:37:59,611 --> 00:38:01,945
And just yesterday, would you

707
00:38:01,946 --> 00:38:05,908
believe it,
I run smack dab into him.

709
00:38:05,909 --> 00:38:08,494
And what's he doin'?

710
00:38:08,495 --> 00:38:09,661
Pretendin' to be some dirt

711
00:38:09,662 --> 00:38:10,829
farmer, scabby ranch in the

712
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,499
middle of nowheres.

713
00:38:13,500 --> 00:38:16,502
What makes you think
he's pretendin'?

715
00:38:16,503 --> 00:38:18,629
'Cause you ain't no fool.

716
00:38:18,630 --> 00:38:20,339
Only a fool would try to fight

717
00:38:20,340 --> 00:38:21,507
against the odds that are

718
00:38:21,508 --> 00:38:23,217
standin' up against you.

719
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:27,596
You keep fightin'
for this railroad...

721
00:38:27,597 --> 00:38:31,683
I'll have to kill you.

722
00:38:31,684 --> 00:38:37,397
Friends oughtn't
to kill friends.

724
00:38:37,398 --> 00:38:39,399
You listen real good, Luke.

725
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:40,859
If you don't talk sense to that

726
00:38:40,860 --> 00:38:42,277
Prescott, all any of you is

727
00:38:42,278 --> 00:38:45,364
gonna end up with is
six feet of this land.

729
00:38:45,365 --> 00:38:47,449
( Gun cocks )

730
00:38:47,450 --> 00:38:53,914
I'm right here, Sonny.

731
00:38:53,915 --> 00:38:55,624
Put the gun down, thurmond.

732
00:38:55,625 --> 00:38:58,544
I'll put it down,
but it'll be smokin'.

734
00:38:58,545 --> 00:39:00,879
He ain't here to make trouble.

736
00:39:00,880 --> 00:39:02,047
Trash like him makes nothin'

737
00:39:02,048 --> 00:39:03,298
but trouble.

738
00:39:03,299 --> 00:39:04,466
You know, old wild bill died

739
00:39:04,467 --> 00:39:06,468
with a bullet in the back of his

740
00:39:06,469 --> 00:39:08,595
head, holdin' the winnin' hand.

741
00:39:08,596 --> 00:39:10,514
Aces and eights.

742
00:39:10,515 --> 00:39:15,687
It's a dead man's hand.

743
00:39:25,488 --> 00:39:27,906
I'll be back tomorrow

744
00:39:27,907 --> 00:39:31,785
to check on monty's dressings.

745
00:39:31,786 --> 00:39:33,996
He's leavin' tomorrow.

746
00:39:33,997 --> 00:39:35,163
Well, then, say good-bye to

747
00:39:35,164 --> 00:39:38,877
him for me, then.

748
00:39:49,929 --> 00:39:55,101
( Screaming )

749
00:40:06,571 --> 00:40:09,990
Let's have a little kiss, sugar.

751
00:40:09,991 --> 00:40:14,495
Oh, you whore!

752
00:40:22,503 --> 00:40:26,340
Damn, Tate,
I didn't get my turn with her.

754
00:40:26,341 --> 00:40:30,928
Shut up and bag 'em.

755
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,367
Just what do you want?

756
00:40:53,368 --> 00:40:55,911
You seem like a nice lady.

757
00:40:55,912 --> 00:40:57,663
I don't wanna see you hurt.

758
00:40:57,664 --> 00:40:59,498
I don't wanna see anybody hurt.

759
00:40:59,499 --> 00:41:01,583
Then don't hurt anybody.

760
00:41:01,584 --> 00:41:03,961
To you, life is cheap.

761
00:41:03,962 --> 00:41:05,754
You've got nothin' to live by

762
00:41:05,755 --> 00:41:07,965
and nobody to live for.

763
00:41:07,966 --> 00:41:12,552
You know Luke, don't you?

764
00:41:12,553 --> 00:41:14,513
In another life.

765
00:41:14,514 --> 00:41:16,974
You wanna talk,
tell me about him.

767
00:41:16,975 --> 00:41:23,772
If you know me, you know Luke.

769
00:41:23,773 --> 00:41:28,653
Ma'am.

770
00:41:37,745 --> 00:41:41,998
Luke. Hey, I'm glad to see ya

771
00:41:41,999 --> 00:41:45,627
handlin' that gun.

772
00:41:45,628 --> 00:41:48,839
You leaving?

773
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,883
A man's got a right
to defend what's his.

775
00:41:51,884 --> 00:41:53,301
It doesn't give him the right

776
00:41:53,302 --> 00:41:55,095
to commit suicide.

777
00:41:55,096 --> 00:41:58,807
Luke, we all gotta die sometime.

779
00:41:58,808 --> 00:42:00,225
But I'd rather it be for

780
00:42:00,226 --> 00:42:03,103
something now than
for nothing later.

782
00:42:03,104 --> 00:42:04,688
Give it up, thurmond.

783
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:06,481
We'll start over.

784
00:42:06,482 --> 00:42:08,191
You, me, Noah.

785
00:42:08,192 --> 00:42:09,359
We'll head up north where

786
00:42:09,360 --> 00:42:15,866
there's rain and good
soil instead of dust.

788
00:42:15,867 --> 00:42:17,284
You know, when I built this

789
00:42:17,285 --> 00:42:23,123
place,
I said it would be my last.

791
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:26,460
I buried Margaret up in oak

792
00:42:26,461 --> 00:42:30,964
hill, but you
know, you're right.

794
00:42:30,965 --> 00:42:33,675
You're young, and you have your

795
00:42:33,676 --> 00:42:35,844
whole life ahead of you.

796
00:42:35,845 --> 00:42:37,637
This isn't your fight.

797
00:42:37,638 --> 00:42:40,599
It's mine.

798
00:42:40,600 --> 00:42:44,729
Good-bye, Luke.

799
00:43:08,836 --> 00:43:11,714
( Woman screams )

800
00:43:44,247 --> 00:43:47,667
Come on.

801
00:43:54,924 --> 00:43:56,633
Who is it?

802
00:43:56,634 --> 00:44:03,723
Luke.

803
00:44:03,724 --> 00:44:12,316
I'm ridin' out I
thought you should know.

805
00:44:21,868 --> 00:44:27,956
I guess I'm not surprised.

806
00:44:27,957 --> 00:44:33,461
Well, that's that.

807
00:44:33,462 --> 00:44:39,092
What happened to us, Luke?

808
00:44:39,093 --> 00:44:44,764
Why didn't it work out?

809
00:44:44,765 --> 00:44:46,182
You wanted no more than any

810
00:44:46,183 --> 00:44:50,979
woman's got a right to expect.

811
00:44:50,980 --> 00:44:58,945
I'll miss you...
All the days of my life.

813
00:44:58,946 --> 00:45:05,369
And I bet you'll come to miss
me, too.

815
00:45:11,792 --> 00:45:15,880
I miss you already.

816
00:45:25,973 --> 00:45:32,104
Why are you doing this?

817
00:45:37,902 --> 00:45:41,906
Stop. Stop!

818
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:31,080
It's gonna take
forever to Bury them.

820
00:46:32,289 --> 00:46:35,166
Ain't no one'll
find 'em down there.

822
00:46:35,167 --> 00:46:38,294
I don't know.
Tate said to Bury 'em good.

824
00:46:38,295 --> 00:46:45,052
Help me with this so
we can go get a drink.

826
00:46:55,980 --> 00:46:57,731
Make sure you get me the

827
00:46:57,732 --> 00:46:59,065
right survey map so we can

828
00:46:59,066 --> 00:47:00,233
properly record what we find.

829
00:47:00,234 --> 00:47:03,696
Yes, sir.

830
00:47:09,869 --> 00:47:12,954
You don't approve?

831
00:47:12,955 --> 00:47:14,122
Doesn't seem to be my place

832
00:47:14,123 --> 00:47:17,417
to judge, Mr. Cracker, now does it?
Nope.

834
00:47:17,418 --> 00:47:18,835
Just seems to me that you're

835
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:21,921
a better man than you let on.

836
00:47:21,922 --> 00:47:23,506
How's that?

837
00:47:23,507 --> 00:47:24,924
The other day at the fence

838
00:47:24,925 --> 00:47:26,092
line, when the others were

839
00:47:26,093 --> 00:47:27,260
fighting, you had the good sense

840
00:47:27,261 --> 00:47:29,679
to stay out of it.

841
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,017
I do my fightin' with this now.

843
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:35,727
I didn't see you go to heel

844
00:47:35,728 --> 00:47:38,104
after the fightin' started, nor

845
00:47:38,105 --> 00:47:40,106
after Prescott fired his rifle.

846
00:47:40,107 --> 00:47:44,152
Gettin' slow.

847
00:47:44,153 --> 00:47:45,862
So where you off to with that

848
00:47:45,863 --> 00:47:49,240
surveyor fella?

849
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:51,993
I gotta get on
the Prescott land.

851
00:47:51,994 --> 00:47:53,703
I gotta do a real survey and

852
00:47:53,704 --> 00:47:55,747
find out what we're dealin'

853
00:47:55,748 --> 00:47:57,624
with.

854
00:47:57,625 --> 00:47:58,792
I think Prescott seems like

855
00:47:58,793 --> 00:48:00,919
a reasonable man.

856
00:48:00,920 --> 00:48:06,216
What about that boss man of
yours, Howard?

858
00:48:06,217 --> 00:48:08,218
Is he interested in reason?

859
00:48:08,219 --> 00:48:09,761
He's not my boss.

860
00:48:09,762 --> 00:48:12,013
I was sent here by Chicago to do

861
00:48:12,014 --> 00:48:13,723
a job, and I'm gonna do it.

862
00:48:13,724 --> 00:48:15,183
If you ask me, they sent you

863
00:48:15,184 --> 00:48:17,185
on a fool's errand.

864
00:48:17,186 --> 00:48:19,145
We both know that railroad's

865
00:48:19,146 --> 00:48:21,898
gonna go right through
this territory.

867
00:48:21,899 --> 00:48:22,858
There's only so many paths it

868
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:25,443
can take, and right now,

869
00:48:25,444 --> 00:48:26,320
that's straight through the

870
00:48:26,321 --> 00:48:28,113
heart of that old man's land,

871
00:48:28,114 --> 00:48:29,697
land he don't wanna give up.

872
00:48:29,698 --> 00:48:31,241
Ain't too hard to figure how

873
00:48:31,242 --> 00:48:33,284
this is gonna end.

874
00:48:33,285 --> 00:48:36,037
If Tate had his way,

875
00:48:36,038 --> 00:48:38,414
it would end only one way.

876
00:48:38,415 --> 00:48:39,666
But the world's changing,

877
00:48:39,667 --> 00:48:41,084
Mr. Cracker, and that type of

878
00:48:41,085 --> 00:48:45,004
violence won't be
tolerated anymore.

880
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,757
This railroad is going to bring

881
00:48:47,758 --> 00:48:50,552
a lot of things... commerce,

882
00:48:50,553 --> 00:48:54,389
progress, but most of all, it's

883
00:48:54,390 --> 00:48:58,059
gonna bring the rule of law.

884
00:48:58,060 --> 00:49:05,275
Men like you and Tate
are a dying breed.

886
00:49:05,276 --> 00:49:08,903
I'm no Tate.

887
00:49:08,904 --> 00:49:10,071
That might be true, but

888
00:49:10,072 --> 00:49:12,323
people can change, Mr. Cracker.

889
00:49:12,324 --> 00:49:14,450
'Cause in the end, if they

890
00:49:14,451 --> 00:49:23,459
don't,
what's their life amounted to?

892
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:28,090
Good day, Mr. Cracker.

893
00:49:58,829 --> 00:50:00,288
Mr. Prescott.

894
00:50:00,289 --> 00:50:02,081
Yeah.

895
00:50:02,082 --> 00:50:03,917
Monty's gone.

896
00:50:03,918 --> 00:50:05,668
I know. Where'd he go?

897
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:09,422
North. Home.

898
00:50:09,423 --> 00:50:12,592
Where's Luke?

899
00:50:12,593 --> 00:50:14,093
Gone.

900
00:50:14,094 --> 00:50:16,012
When's he comin' back?

901
00:50:16,013 --> 00:50:18,890
He ain't.

902
00:50:18,891 --> 00:50:21,476
Did Luke run away?

903
00:50:21,477 --> 00:50:23,436
Get your gear, son.

904
00:50:23,437 --> 00:50:25,605
I'm gonna take you back to town.

905
00:50:25,606 --> 00:50:28,233
No, no. You hired me.

906
00:50:28,234 --> 00:50:31,194
I got no more use for help.

907
00:50:31,195 --> 00:50:33,238
Don't you understand?

908
00:50:33,239 --> 00:50:34,114
There's a railroad comin'

909
00:50:34,115 --> 00:50:35,657
through here, boy.

910
00:50:35,658 --> 00:50:38,868
We'll fight 'em, then.

911
00:50:38,869 --> 00:50:43,164
A few more like you,
I reckon we could.

913
00:50:43,165 --> 00:50:45,875
Get your gear, boy.

914
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,752
We're through here.

915
00:50:47,753 --> 00:50:52,716
Come on.

916
00:51:06,397 --> 00:51:07,981
It's done.

917
00:51:07,982 --> 00:51:09,649
And they won't be found.

918
00:51:09,650 --> 00:51:13,278
No.

919
00:51:13,279 --> 00:51:14,862
I heard one of Prescott's

920
00:51:14,863 --> 00:51:17,157
men, monty,
packed up and moved out.

922
00:51:17,158 --> 00:51:18,908
And what about rivers?

923
00:51:18,909 --> 00:51:20,326
Rivers has been seen in town

924
00:51:20,327 --> 00:51:21,369
with the schoolteacher.

925
00:51:21,370 --> 00:51:22,537
If he isn't out at

926
00:51:22,538 --> 00:51:23,705
Prescott's, that makes him fair

927
00:51:23,706 --> 00:51:24,747
game, right?

928
00:51:24,748 --> 00:51:26,165
Tell your boys to keep their

929
00:51:26,166 --> 00:51:27,625
eyes open, but make it look like

930
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,210
he made the first move, and take

931
00:51:29,211 --> 00:51:30,795
cracker with you this time.

932
00:51:30,796 --> 00:51:32,213
I thought you wanted me to

933
00:51:32,214 --> 00:51:33,256
keep things quiet.

934
00:51:33,257 --> 00:51:37,803
Use him.

935
00:52:07,124 --> 00:52:13,629
What do you think, Mr. Riley?

936
00:52:13,630 --> 00:52:17,760
I think this is it.

937
00:52:25,809 --> 00:52:29,813
Good god!

938
00:52:35,611 --> 00:52:39,322
Who would do something like this?
Indians.

940
00:52:39,323 --> 00:52:40,490
I don't think the Indians

941
00:52:40,491 --> 00:52:42,200
would take the time to bag up

942
00:52:42,201 --> 00:52:45,370
the bodies and dump
them way out here.

944
00:52:45,371 --> 00:52:48,122
Someone else did this.

945
00:52:48,123 --> 00:52:54,838
They didn't want these
bodies to be found.

947
00:53:08,477 --> 00:53:11,396
You boys look tuckered.

948
00:53:11,397 --> 00:53:12,563
Well, wouldn't be if we stood

949
00:53:12,564 --> 00:53:14,690
around here like you.

950
00:53:14,691 --> 00:53:19,195
Or him.

951
00:53:19,196 --> 00:53:20,363
When the hell you gonna let

952
00:53:20,364 --> 00:53:22,073
him work up a sweat?

953
00:53:22,074 --> 00:53:26,995
Don't worry, he will.

954
00:53:40,426 --> 00:53:44,220
You think he'll stick it out?

955
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:49,475
I hope not.

956
00:53:49,476 --> 00:53:52,687
That's why you left, isn't it?

958
00:53:52,688 --> 00:53:58,359
So he'll quit when he
realizes he's alone?

960
00:53:58,360 --> 00:54:02,864
It won't be so bad
livin' in town.

962
00:54:02,865 --> 00:54:04,323
There'll be other boys there...

963
00:54:04,324 --> 00:54:06,367
I hate towns.

964
00:54:06,368 --> 00:54:11,248
I hate 'em, too.

965
00:54:12,458 --> 00:54:14,041
I think that does it.

966
00:54:14,042 --> 00:54:18,213
I'm gonna settle up.

967
00:54:41,320 --> 00:54:45,281
Run down there and
go get Mr. Tate.

969
00:54:45,282 --> 00:54:47,950
We all have choices.

970
00:54:47,951 --> 00:54:50,411
Leavin' was my choice.

971
00:54:50,412 --> 00:54:53,332
Thurmond's choice is up to him.

972
00:55:06,887 --> 00:55:12,726
Any notion where you're headed?

974
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:21,318
Just north.

975
00:55:27,950 --> 00:55:32,453
So after north,
when that doesn't work out.

977
00:55:32,454 --> 00:55:35,790
East, then west, I guess.

978
00:55:35,791 --> 00:55:40,127
Then south.

979
00:55:40,128 --> 00:55:44,716
That about covers it.

980
00:55:55,727 --> 00:56:00,941
Pick it up.

981
00:56:06,947 --> 00:56:08,364
'Bout time you headed back up

982
00:56:08,365 --> 00:56:11,492
to that schoolhouse of
yours, ain't it?

984
00:56:11,493 --> 00:56:13,494
I'm not leaving you.

985
00:56:13,495 --> 00:56:14,413
That's good.

986
00:56:14,414 --> 00:56:16,247
She can stick around here and

987
00:56:16,248 --> 00:56:19,584
watch her little hero get what

988
00:56:19,585 --> 00:56:20,793
you and that bastard Prescott

989
00:56:20,794 --> 00:56:27,258
have been beggin' for.

990
00:56:27,259 --> 00:56:29,135
I'm tired of playin' around.

991
00:56:29,136 --> 00:56:34,099
You pick up that gun.

992
00:56:46,111 --> 00:56:48,696
Go ahead. Pick it up.

993
00:56:48,697 --> 00:56:50,573
You got no argument with that

994
00:56:50,574 --> 00:56:52,992
Tate that don't include me.

995
00:56:52,993 --> 00:56:54,535
Put the gun down, thurmond.

996
00:56:54,536 --> 00:56:59,958
This is between Tate and me.

997
00:57:32,240 --> 00:57:33,991
Oh, Luke.

998
00:57:33,992 --> 00:57:36,077
Don't talk.

999
00:57:36,078 --> 00:57:38,621
It's yours now.

1000
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:41,666
Oak hill.

1001
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:48,382
You oughta take me home.

1002
00:58:02,145 --> 00:58:06,858
Let's get him into the wagon.

1003
00:58:11,363 --> 00:58:14,240
Cracker, you're workin'

1004
00:58:14,241 --> 00:58:18,995
for me.

1005
00:58:24,000 --> 00:58:28,505
It's a changin' world.

1006
00:58:38,473 --> 00:58:41,058
Oh, we're on thin ice here.

1007
00:58:41,059 --> 00:58:42,768
I made the numbers look as good

1008
00:58:42,769 --> 00:58:44,478
as possible.

1009
00:58:44,479 --> 00:58:47,898
You're a fine accountant.

1010
00:58:47,899 --> 00:58:50,693
( Men talking loudly )

1011
00:58:50,694 --> 00:58:53,028
Hey, what's goin' on here?

1012
00:58:53,029 --> 00:58:54,780
What happened?

1013
00:58:54,781 --> 00:58:56,449
Let me through.

1014
00:58:56,450 --> 00:58:57,616
You wanna talk? This is what

1015
00:58:57,617 --> 00:58:58,909
talkin' gets you.

1016
00:58:58,910 --> 00:59:00,202
This is rivers' work.

1017
00:59:00,203 --> 00:59:01,079
Him and that double-crossin'

1018
00:59:01,080 --> 00:59:02,621
bastard cracker.

1019
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,206
Men, listen to me.

1020
00:59:04,207 --> 00:59:07,543
We're railroad men,
not vigilantes.

1022
00:59:07,544 --> 00:59:10,087
Our job is to survey
for the track.

1024
00:59:10,088 --> 00:59:11,630
You bastards started it.

1025
00:59:11,631 --> 00:59:12,798
I didn't start it, I wasn't

1026
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:14,216
there. You weren't either.

1027
00:59:14,217 --> 00:59:15,010
This was cold-blooded murder.

1028
00:59:15,011 --> 00:59:16,928
These boys didn't
stand a chance.

1030
00:59:16,929 --> 00:59:18,345
If we have to fight, we'll

1031
00:59:18,346 --> 00:59:19,847
fight, but we didn't come here

1032
00:59:19,848 --> 00:59:21,557
to start a war.

1033
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:23,809
We came here to build a railroad

1034
00:59:23,810 --> 00:59:27,104
and to get rich.

1035
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:29,523
You know what this is?

1036
00:59:29,524 --> 00:59:30,983
This is a telegram from the home

1037
00:59:30,984 --> 00:59:33,652
office in Chicago, authorizing

1038
00:59:33,653 --> 00:59:35,654
me to pay each of you a $25

1039
00:59:35,655 --> 00:59:37,656
bonus if we finish our work here

1040
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,700
by the end of this week.

1041
00:59:39,701 --> 00:59:41,786
Now who's with me?

1042
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:44,038
Who wants a $25 bonus?

1043
00:59:44,039 --> 00:59:47,541
Man: I want justice
is what I want.

1045
00:59:47,542 --> 00:59:50,669
That's what we want, yeah.

1046
00:59:50,670 --> 00:59:51,962
You got some work to do?

1047
00:59:51,963 --> 00:59:54,590
Let's get with it, Mr. Tate.

1048
00:59:54,591 --> 00:59:57,594
We should go get 'em.

1049
01:01:06,663 --> 01:01:10,332
Wow!

1050
01:01:10,333 --> 01:01:16,005
Monty!

1051
01:01:16,006 --> 01:01:17,172
I sure am glad you boy

1052
01:01:17,173 --> 01:01:19,675
didn't start the
party without me.

1054
01:01:19,676 --> 01:01:21,218
You're back.

1055
01:01:21,219 --> 01:01:22,887
You came back!

1056
01:01:22,888 --> 01:01:24,221
Shoulda kept goin' all the

1057
01:01:24,222 --> 01:01:25,806
way back to Montana.

1058
01:01:25,807 --> 01:01:26,807
Started off in that

1059
01:01:26,808 --> 01:01:28,309
direction, but along about noon,

1060
01:01:28,310 --> 01:01:30,144
I got to thinkin', and, well,

1061
01:01:30,145 --> 01:01:31,562
guess them trout'll have to wait

1062
01:01:31,563 --> 01:01:34,732
a while longer.

1063
01:01:34,733 --> 01:01:36,692
Name's monty.

1064
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:38,027
Don't think we were properly

1065
01:01:38,028 --> 01:01:41,780
introduced last time we met.

1066
01:01:41,781 --> 01:01:45,576
Cracker. D.C. cracker.

1067
01:01:45,577 --> 01:01:46,744
Didn't expect to find you on

1068
01:01:46,745 --> 01:01:48,454
this side of the wire.

1069
01:01:48,455 --> 01:01:52,416
I didn't expect to be here.

1070
01:01:52,417 --> 01:01:58,797
Where's thurmond?

1071
01:01:58,798 --> 01:02:01,759
He's up on oak hill.

1072
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:02,927
Guess I'll mosey on up there

1073
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:04,470
and let him know there'll be

1074
01:02:04,471 --> 01:02:05,930
five of us waiting on this side

1075
01:02:05,931 --> 01:02:10,101
of the wire.

1076
01:02:48,890 --> 01:02:54,520
Damn it all.

1077
01:02:54,521 --> 01:02:58,900
Damn it all to hell.

1078
01:03:02,570 --> 01:03:05,280
So, Mr. Riley.

1079
01:03:05,281 --> 01:03:10,369
What news do you have?

1080
01:03:10,370 --> 01:03:11,829
I think I found a way for

1081
01:03:11,830 --> 01:03:14,748
both parties to get what they want.
How?

1083
01:03:14,749 --> 01:03:15,916
It's gonna take more time

1084
01:03:15,917 --> 01:03:17,084
and cost more money, but this

1085
01:03:17,085 --> 01:03:18,252
route, coupled with a few

1086
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:21,839
trade-offs, it could work.

1087
01:03:21,840 --> 01:03:23,090
How is that?

1088
01:03:23,091 --> 01:03:24,842
I traveled the route today

1089
01:03:24,843 --> 01:03:26,552
with a surveyor from one end to

1090
01:03:26,553 --> 01:03:27,553
the other, and I think Prescott

1091
01:03:27,554 --> 01:03:30,764
might accept my new proposal.

1092
01:03:30,765 --> 01:03:33,392
Good.

1093
01:03:33,393 --> 01:03:35,936
There's one other thing.

1094
01:03:35,937 --> 01:03:37,187
When we were comin' back here,

1095
01:03:37,188 --> 01:03:40,232
we came across some
dead bodies in a gully.

1097
01:03:40,233 --> 01:03:43,110
We should call the
county sheriff.

1099
01:03:43,111 --> 01:03:45,195
I'll telegraph the sheriff

1100
01:03:45,196 --> 01:03:48,532
first thing in the morning.

1101
01:03:48,533 --> 01:03:50,868
Okay.

1102
01:03:50,869 --> 01:03:55,749
Thank you.

1103
01:04:08,845 --> 01:04:10,971
He found them.

1104
01:04:10,972 --> 01:04:12,723
I'll take care of it.

1105
01:04:12,724 --> 01:04:14,975
Mr. Riley is not an idiot.

1106
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:16,727
As soon as he finds out you had

1107
01:04:16,728 --> 01:04:17,895
something to do with Prescott's

1108
01:04:17,896 --> 01:04:20,397
death,
he's going to figure it out.

1110
01:04:20,398 --> 01:04:21,774
And when he figures it out,

1111
01:04:21,775 --> 01:04:27,112
you're going to hang,
and me with you.

1113
01:04:27,113 --> 01:04:29,698
They got nothin'.

1114
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:30,824
I'm gonna go out there, and

1115
01:04:30,825 --> 01:04:35,662
I'm going to back
Mr. Riley's plan 100%.

1117
01:04:35,663 --> 01:04:36,830
He doesn't know he's gonna walk

1118
01:04:36,831 --> 01:04:40,042
into a hornets'
nest there tomorrow.

1120
01:04:40,043 --> 01:04:41,752
And once he does, I want things

1121
01:04:41,753 --> 01:04:47,299
to go bad real fast.

1122
01:04:47,300 --> 01:04:48,717
And then, Riley gets caught in

1123
01:04:48,718 --> 01:04:51,762
the crossfire. You understand?

1124
01:04:51,763 --> 01:04:52,930
Completely.

1125
01:04:52,931 --> 01:04:55,974
Good. And you better pray for

1126
01:04:55,975 --> 01:04:59,646
yourself real hard, my man.

1127
01:05:11,658 --> 01:05:13,742
I sure as hell don't like the

1128
01:05:13,743 --> 01:05:14,827
idea of us just sittin' here

1129
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:16,703
waitin' for 'em to come.

1130
01:05:16,704 --> 01:05:19,832
We don't have much of a choice.

1132
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:21,458
We'll split up the night.

1133
01:05:21,459 --> 01:05:24,253
Do watches in three shifts.

1134
01:05:24,254 --> 01:05:26,088
I'll go first.

1135
01:05:26,089 --> 01:05:31,845
All right.
We'll see you back there.

1137
01:05:39,811 --> 01:05:42,855
Surveyors are makin' up time.

1138
01:05:42,856 --> 01:05:47,234
Chicago's gonna be happy.

1139
01:05:47,235 --> 01:05:51,864
We could acquire oak hill.

1140
01:05:51,865 --> 01:05:53,031
You really think he's gonna

1141
01:05:53,032 --> 01:05:57,744
be waitin' there?

1142
01:05:57,745 --> 01:05:58,912
If you were him, would you

1143
01:05:58,913 --> 01:06:01,957
want some fella from Chicago

1144
01:06:01,958 --> 01:06:06,880
running you off your place?

1145
01:07:10,693 --> 01:07:12,236
Come on, let's go.

1146
01:07:12,237 --> 01:07:14,489
Boss, some of the men,
they're gettin'...

1148
01:07:14,490 --> 01:07:18,534
Men are gettin' paid.

1149
01:07:35,176 --> 01:07:36,635
You mind if I take a squint

1150
01:07:36,636 --> 01:07:39,471
through them goggles, son?

1151
01:07:39,472 --> 01:07:41,265
Good mornin', Mr. Cracker.

1152
01:07:41,266 --> 01:07:42,307
Good mornin'.

1153
01:07:42,308 --> 01:07:44,977
Monty.

1154
01:07:44,978 --> 01:07:49,065
Take a look.

1155
01:07:54,529 --> 01:07:56,947
They'll be comin' soon.

1156
01:07:56,948 --> 01:08:00,534
That they will, boy.

1157
01:08:00,535 --> 01:08:04,289
Yes, sir. That they will.

1158
01:08:17,176 --> 01:08:21,346
Luke.

1159
01:08:21,347 --> 01:08:25,977
Jo.

1160
01:08:30,815 --> 01:08:34,986
What's goin' on?

1161
01:08:41,617 --> 01:08:44,870
Noah!

1162
01:08:44,871 --> 01:08:49,167
What's the matter, Luke?

1163
01:08:55,006 --> 01:08:56,131
Monty.

1164
01:08:56,132 --> 01:08:59,009
Monty! I thought monty left.

1165
01:08:59,010 --> 01:09:02,346
He came back.

1166
01:09:02,347 --> 01:09:04,056
Why, Luke?

1167
01:09:04,057 --> 01:09:06,224
Why did he come back?

1168
01:09:06,225 --> 01:09:10,979
'Cause we're stayin'.

1169
01:09:10,980 --> 01:09:13,398
You're crazy.

1170
01:09:13,399 --> 01:09:15,859
Maybe. But that's how it is.

1171
01:09:15,860 --> 01:09:16,736
But yesterday you were

1172
01:09:16,737 --> 01:09:19,029
leavin', so why stay now?

1173
01:09:19,030 --> 01:09:23,284
'Cause thurmond's dead.

1174
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:29,206
Gettin' killed won't
bring him back.

1176
01:09:29,207 --> 01:09:32,292
No.

1177
01:09:32,293 --> 01:09:34,586
Then why?

1178
01:09:34,587 --> 01:09:36,880
You wanna stay, don't you?

1179
01:09:36,881 --> 01:09:39,966
I saw you at
butterfield's yesterday.

1181
01:09:39,967 --> 01:09:44,221
That look in your eyes.

1182
01:09:44,222 --> 01:09:48,725
I hope that's not true.

1183
01:09:48,726 --> 01:09:51,770
Maybe you're right.

1184
01:09:51,771 --> 01:09:53,647
Maybe guys like me don't change.

1185
01:09:53,648 --> 01:09:55,315
Can't.

1186
01:09:55,316 --> 01:09:57,234
I don't have the answers, Jo.

1187
01:09:57,235 --> 01:09:58,235
I don't know why cracker's

1188
01:09:58,236 --> 01:09:59,945
with us instead of against us.

1189
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:01,113
I don't know why monty came

1190
01:10:01,114 --> 01:10:05,450
back when it's not his fight.

1191
01:10:05,451 --> 01:10:10,205
Why thurmond took me in.

1192
01:10:10,206 --> 01:10:16,002
All I know...
Is I've been runnin' and

1194
01:10:16,003 --> 01:10:21,591
fightin' my whole damn
life, and I'm tired.

1196
01:10:21,592 --> 01:10:22,759
And I finally found somethin'

1197
01:10:22,760 --> 01:10:27,348
worth fightin' for.

1198
01:10:37,108 --> 01:10:39,151
Ma'am.

1199
01:10:39,152 --> 01:10:41,319
They're almost at the wire.

1200
01:10:41,320 --> 01:10:43,113
They're pushin', all right.

1201
01:10:43,114 --> 01:10:44,364
Get your things.

1202
01:10:44,365 --> 01:10:45,699
You're goin' with Jo.

1203
01:10:45,700 --> 01:10:47,033
No, I'm stayin'.

1204
01:10:47,034 --> 01:10:48,827
No, you're not.

1205
01:10:48,828 --> 01:10:50,871
But I wanna fight.

1206
01:10:50,872 --> 01:10:53,999
I've been practicin'.

1207
01:10:54,000 --> 01:10:55,459
Get your things!

1208
01:10:55,460 --> 01:10:56,710
Said I'm goin'!

1209
01:10:56,711 --> 01:10:58,211
Alone if I have to.

1210
01:10:58,212 --> 01:11:01,047
Pretty good with pop
gun, are you?

1212
01:11:01,048 --> 01:11:06,136
I hit what I aim at.

1213
01:11:06,137 --> 01:11:08,472
Hit me.

1214
01:11:08,473 --> 01:11:10,265
What?

1215
01:11:10,266 --> 01:11:14,060
Go ahead, shoot me.

1216
01:11:14,061 --> 01:11:16,938
No. I ain't gonna.

1217
01:11:16,939 --> 01:11:20,192
I think the boy's a
coward, Luke.

1219
01:11:20,193 --> 01:11:22,527
Yeah, I guess.

1220
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:24,863
Shut up.

1221
01:11:24,864 --> 01:11:28,033
Yeah, look, he's
cowardly, all right.

1223
01:11:28,034 --> 01:11:29,201
One finger on the trigger, and

1224
01:11:29,202 --> 01:11:31,036
he's too damn scared to pull it.

1225
01:11:31,037 --> 01:11:35,833
Shut up!

1226
01:11:41,339 --> 01:11:46,718
See now what Luke's
been tellin' you? Hm?

1228
01:11:46,719 --> 01:11:49,387
No shame in it, son.

1229
01:11:49,388 --> 01:11:57,270
This just ain't your
time, that's all.

1231
01:11:57,271 --> 01:11:58,563
I hope you both get killed.

1232
01:11:58,564 --> 01:12:03,194
Noah, come back. Noah!

1233
01:12:08,616 --> 01:12:11,284
Find him, Jo.

1234
01:12:11,285 --> 01:12:12,994
Make him understand.

1235
01:12:12,995 --> 01:12:17,749
Please, Luke, don't do this.

1236
01:12:17,750 --> 01:12:20,252
They'll kill you.

1237
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:23,838
Maybe.

1238
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:24,423
Whatever happens, shoulda

1239
01:12:24,424 --> 01:12:28,844
happened years ago.

1240
01:12:34,851 --> 01:12:36,434
You better get goin'.

1241
01:12:36,435 --> 01:12:37,894
The way that kid runs, he'll be

1242
01:12:37,895 --> 01:12:42,149
in Mexico before you catch him.

1243
01:12:49,574 --> 01:12:51,866
Noah. Noah!

1244
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:54,244
Please try to understand.

1245
01:12:54,245 --> 01:12:55,704
No!!

1246
01:12:55,705 --> 01:12:57,080
It's for the best.

1247
01:12:57,081 --> 01:12:58,206
I don't care.

1248
01:12:58,207 --> 01:13:01,167
They don't want you hurt.

1249
01:13:01,168 --> 01:13:04,296
I coulda helped.

1250
01:13:04,297 --> 01:13:08,300
They need me.

1251
01:13:08,301 --> 01:13:11,094
Luke did this
because he loves you.

1253
01:13:11,095 --> 01:13:12,262
Because he doesn't want the gun

1254
01:13:12,263 --> 01:13:13,888
to become a part of your life

1255
01:13:13,889 --> 01:13:16,809
the way that it did his.

1256
01:13:47,381 --> 01:13:50,508
Where you goin'?

1257
01:13:50,509 --> 01:13:56,640
Just to talk.

1258
01:13:56,641 --> 01:14:02,687
Morning, gentlemen.

1259
01:14:02,688 --> 01:14:06,483
I am unarmed.

1260
01:14:06,484 --> 01:14:08,777
Him, too.

1261
01:14:08,778 --> 01:14:13,406
That's good, right?

1262
01:14:13,407 --> 01:14:14,574
So you decided you didn't like

1263
01:14:14,575 --> 01:14:17,327
railroad money,
huh, Mr. Cracker?

1265
01:14:17,328 --> 01:14:19,829
Nope. Just the railroad.

1266
01:14:19,830 --> 01:14:21,581
Drunk, that's what you are.

1267
01:14:21,582 --> 01:14:23,041
Just a body scraped up off

1268
01:14:23,042 --> 01:14:25,335
a whorehouse floor.

1269
01:14:25,336 --> 01:14:26,628
( Men chuckling )

1270
01:14:26,629 --> 01:14:28,088
That's the truth.

1271
01:14:28,089 --> 01:14:30,465
Gentlemen,
I don't want any trouble today.

1273
01:14:30,466 --> 01:14:32,008
The way that track's headed,

1274
01:14:32,009 --> 01:14:36,846
I'd say you're lookin' for it.

1275
01:14:36,847 --> 01:14:38,515
Are you gonna listen to this?

1276
01:14:38,516 --> 01:14:40,141
He's threatenin' us.

1277
01:14:40,142 --> 01:14:42,435
Please, we can handle this

1278
01:14:42,436 --> 01:14:44,521
matter peacefully.

1279
01:14:44,522 --> 01:14:46,147
Now where's Mr. Prescott?

1280
01:14:46,148 --> 01:14:51,570
I have a plan that
will solve everything.

1282
01:14:56,575 --> 01:14:59,494
That's a poor joke, Riley,

1283
01:14:59,495 --> 01:15:01,162
even for a railroad man.

1284
01:15:01,163 --> 01:15:02,706
I don't understand.

1285
01:15:02,707 --> 01:15:05,542
You know damn well
thurmond's dead.

1287
01:15:05,543 --> 01:15:07,627
He's dead?

1288
01:15:07,628 --> 01:15:14,384
I... I didn't.

1289
01:15:14,385 --> 01:15:16,678
Do you know anything about this?

1290
01:15:16,679 --> 01:15:18,430
He should. Him and his

1291
01:15:18,431 --> 01:15:25,979
friends gunned him down.

1292
01:15:25,980 --> 01:15:28,565
Find Donald butterfield.

1293
01:15:28,566 --> 01:15:30,734
Collect your pay.

1294
01:15:30,735 --> 01:15:32,902
You can't fire me.

1295
01:15:32,903 --> 01:15:38,576
You're through.

1296
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:44,622
I liked Prescott.

1297
01:15:44,623 --> 01:15:46,791
I respected him.

1298
01:15:46,792 --> 01:15:51,254
He was a good man,
and I'm sorry he's dead.

1300
01:15:51,255 --> 01:15:54,591
But the fact is, we're here,

1301
01:15:54,592 --> 01:15:56,551
alive, and I've worked out

1302
01:15:56,552 --> 01:15:59,387
a plan that I think... I hope

1303
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:03,809
is gonna keep us that way.

1304
01:16:19,617 --> 01:16:22,452
Here's your ranch.

1305
01:16:22,453 --> 01:16:26,331
House, pumps, irrigation field,

1306
01:16:26,332 --> 01:16:28,583
barn, et cetera.

1307
01:16:28,584 --> 01:16:30,251
And here's the railroad,

1308
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:31,628
comin' through this way,

1309
01:16:31,629 --> 01:16:33,963
right through your property.

1310
01:16:33,964 --> 01:16:36,758
However, I've come up with three

1311
01:16:36,759 --> 01:16:38,551
alternatives, all of which are

1312
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:39,470
gonna cost the railroad both

1313
01:16:39,471 --> 01:16:42,555
time and money, but none of

1314
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:45,683
which should cost
anybody else their lives.

1316
01:16:45,684 --> 01:16:47,102
Now I'd like to avoid this

1317
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:51,189
direction 'cause of the gullies.

1318
01:16:51,190 --> 01:16:54,442
And this way's bad because the

1319
01:16:54,443 --> 01:16:57,153
Sandy land won't
support our track beds.

1321
01:16:57,154 --> 01:17:00,615
But... if we swing a wide loop

1322
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:02,450
this way, missing your buildings

1323
01:17:02,451 --> 01:17:04,494
and your irrigation field,

1324
01:17:04,495 --> 01:17:05,662
cutting off this portion of your

1325
01:17:05,663 --> 01:17:07,831
property right here, which is

1326
01:17:07,832 --> 01:17:10,875
currently unused.

1327
01:17:10,876 --> 01:17:12,836
In return, the railroad will

1328
01:17:12,837 --> 01:17:14,254
give you an equal portion of

1329
01:17:14,255 --> 01:17:15,421
property adjacent to the land

1330
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:17,340
you already keep.

1331
01:17:17,341 --> 01:17:19,717
Plus, the free machinery and

1332
01:17:19,718 --> 01:17:21,302
manpower to build your own

1333
01:17:21,303 --> 01:17:22,179
irrigation system better than

1334
01:17:22,180 --> 01:17:26,516
the one you already have.

1335
01:17:26,517 --> 01:17:29,060
That's a good plan.

1336
01:17:29,061 --> 01:17:37,486
That's a workable plan...
For all of us.

1338
01:17:44,660 --> 01:17:47,495
What do you think?

1339
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,414
Appears fair.

1340
01:17:49,415 --> 01:17:50,582
We're givin' up somethin' but

1341
01:17:50,583 --> 01:17:52,417
get somethin' even better.

1342
01:17:52,418 --> 01:17:55,587
Not bad.

1343
01:17:55,588 --> 01:17:59,757
Can we trust him?

1344
01:17:59,758 --> 01:18:05,597
Yeah. I trust him.

1345
01:18:05,598 --> 01:18:10,644
I think thurmond
would be pleased.

1347
01:18:17,026 --> 01:18:18,443
Hell with Prescott.

1348
01:18:18,444 --> 01:18:20,194
What about my men?

1349
01:18:20,195 --> 01:18:21,613
Three men murdered by you and

1350
01:18:21,614 --> 01:18:23,615
that drunken son of a bitch.

1351
01:18:23,616 --> 01:18:28,745
Come on.
What are you waitin' for?

1353
01:18:28,746 --> 01:18:33,626
No!!

1354
01:19:52,371 --> 01:19:56,040
Stop! Stop!

1355
01:19:56,041 --> 01:20:00,337
Stop! Everybody stop!

1356
01:20:07,720 --> 01:20:11,765
Reloading.

1357
01:20:14,727 --> 01:20:16,102
Luke!

1358
01:20:16,103 --> 01:20:19,606
Noah! Noah!

1359
01:20:25,279 --> 01:20:29,198
Get down!

1360
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:34,037
Get down, Noah!

1361
01:20:34,038 --> 01:20:37,750
Monty!

1362
01:20:57,770 --> 01:21:00,773
Get down, Noah!

1363
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:11,158
Get outta here, Noah!

1364
01:21:25,547 --> 01:21:27,465
You look like hell.

1365
01:21:27,466 --> 01:21:31,803
Yeah? Well, how you doin'?

1366
01:21:31,804 --> 01:21:35,890
I've been better.

1367
01:21:35,891 --> 01:21:41,854
Thanks.

1368
01:21:41,855 --> 01:21:45,776
Oh, come on.

1369
01:22:43,625 --> 01:22:47,629
Wait. He's mine.

1370
01:22:53,343 --> 01:22:56,054
I won't miss like last time.

1371
01:23:32,799 --> 01:23:37,345
Boy.

1372
01:23:37,346 --> 01:23:39,931
Change is comin', son.

1373
01:23:39,932 --> 01:23:41,641
Pick up that gun, and you won't

1374
01:23:41,642 --> 01:23:47,688
be part of it.

1375
01:23:47,689 --> 01:23:48,898
But there's a railroad comin'

1376
01:23:48,899 --> 01:23:55,906
through,
and I'm gonna need some good men.

1378
01:24:05,624 --> 01:24:10,127
Luke. Luke!

1379
01:24:10,128 --> 01:24:11,837
Hey, you, hang on, Luke.

1380
01:24:11,838 --> 01:24:14,924
You're gonna make it.

1381
01:24:14,925 --> 01:24:17,843
I'm not goin' anywhere.

1382
01:24:17,844 --> 01:24:19,553
You better not.

1383
01:24:19,554 --> 01:24:21,889
I think we can, uh...

1384
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:24,267
I think we can
stop the bleeding.

1386
01:24:24,268 --> 01:24:29,105
No, Jo,
I mean I'm not leavin' you again.

1388
01:24:29,106 --> 01:24:31,773
Some things are worth fightin' for.

1389
01:24:33,774 --> 01:24:37,360
.
