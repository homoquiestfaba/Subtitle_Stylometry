1
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:32,002
How is not
my reservation?

2
00:00:32,003 --> 00:00:34,023
I'm sorry sir not find it.

3
00:00:35,824 --> 00:00:37,067
"When you reserve a table?

4
00:00:37,068 --> 00:00:39,474
On Valentine's Day
when they got one.

5
00:00:39,475 --> 00:00:40,717
"When you confirm?

6
00:00:44,362 --> 00:00:46,647
Sorry, did not know what to wear.

7
00:00:55,055 --> 00:00:56,146
Here.

8
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,623
Everything changes when it
the beautiful girl.

9
00:01:05,296 --> 00:01:08,675
We met in April when
played a softball game.

10
00:01:09,024 --> 00:01:11,784
He picked up the ball
take the field.

11
00:01:12,053 --> 00:01:14,483
I made his statement
tax and together ...

12
00:01:14,518 --> 00:01:16,454
we had fun.

13
00:01:16,724 --> 00:01:18,189
He was in love.

14
00:01:19,067 --> 00:01:20,657
I never tired of it.

15
00:01:21,124 --> 00:01:22,972
And it was special.

16
00:01:24,592 --> 00:01:27,307
In October, I confessed
they steal your heart.

17
00:01:27,511 --> 00:01:30,002
So for halloween
dressed up in prison.

18
00:01:30,471 --> 00:01:33,089
Could handcuff
and lose the key.

19
00:01:33,917 --> 00:01:35,915
Christmas came and met
their parents.

20
00:01:36,142 --> 00:01:39,049
His father said he had a good
greet and inspire confidence.

21
00:01:39,254 --> 00:01:41,351
Her mom liked
like to laugh.

22
00:01:41,955 --> 00:01:44,481
We went for Valentine's Day
to the beach.

23
00:01:44,482 --> 00:01:46,036
For a little bed
and breakfasts.

24
00:01:46,543 --> 00:01:49,186
Say it was more bed
I eat breakfast.

25
00:01:50,350 --> 00:01:53,565
Shortly afterwards he was the anniversary
the day we met.

26
00:01:53,792 --> 00:01:55,496
It was the best year of my life.

27
00:01:56,777 --> 00:01:58,251
Another Halloween.

28
00:01:58,252 --> 00:01:59,684
We had the photo album.

29
00:01:59,685 --> 00:02:00,673
History.

30
00:02:00,674 --> 00:02:01,891
We were a couple.

31
00:02:01,964 --> 00:02:03,268
He was my angel.

32
00:02:03,682 --> 00:02:05,770
We listened to our
favorite songs.

33
00:02:06,205 --> 00:02:07,450
I bought clothes,

34
00:02:07,451 --> 00:02:09,006
we finished
each other's sentences.

35
00:02:09,345 --> 00:02:11,193
We talked about the future.

36
00:02:11,605 --> 00:02:15,590
On our second Valentine's Day
became my longest relationship.

37
00:02:16,213 --> 00:02:18,552
But I felt
as the first day.

38
00:02:18,967 --> 00:02:21,731
On his birthday we
to New Orleans.

39
00:02:21,919 --> 00:02:24,072
We ate crab
hear the radiators.

40
00:02:24,548 --> 00:02:26,222
We drank too many hurricanes.

41
00:02:26,223 --> 00:02:28,129
And all he threw necklaces ...

42
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:29,984
Without the lifting of the blouse.

43
00:02:30,735 --> 00:02:32,135
Just look at it.

44
00:02:32,136 --> 00:02:33,890
My Chloe, unique.

45
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:36,523
A ray of sunshine.

46
00:02:36,927 --> 00:02:37,889
Hermosa.

47
00:02:48,651 --> 00:02:49,999
This very good.

48
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,638
But I have to do
extra exercise.

49
00:02:53,329 --> 00:02:54,881
Sure you burn
later.

50
00:02:55,603 --> 00:02:57,433
Perhaps we should ask for the bill.

51
00:03:01,971 --> 00:03:03,602
Happy Valentine's Day.

52
00:03:03,703 --> 00:03:05,540
Steven this is?

53
00:03:05,605 --> 00:03:06,514
Just open it.

54
00:03:12,161 --> 00:03:13,692
My God.

55
00:03:15,111 --> 00:03:16,683
It's beautiful.

56
00:03:19,492 --> 00:03:21,592
You, come here.

57
00:03:52,058 --> 00:03:53,519
I love you so much.

58
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:54,877
I love you too.

59
00:04:18,812 --> 00:04:20,155
Do not quit.

60
00:04:20,747 --> 00:04:22,319
I love making love.

61
00:04:32,752 --> 00:04:34,575
- Should we not answer?
- No!

62
00:04:37,485 --> 00:04:39,513
But it is half past one
can be an emergency.

63
00:04:39,948 --> 00:04:41,047
Okay.

64
00:04:41,568 --> 00:04:42,990
I want you inside me.

65
00:04:51,770 --> 00:04:52,986
Should answer.

66
00:04:57,270 --> 00:04:58,162
I'll answer.

67
00:04:58,456 --> 00:04:59,163
No.

68
00:05:02,369 --> 00:05:03,346
Hello.

69
00:05:03,841 --> 00:05:04,791
Oh, hello.

70
00:05:04,792 --> 00:05:06,321
I was asleep.

71
00:05:06,322 --> 00:05:07,395
Who is it?

72
00:05:37,956 --> 00:05:41,726
Baby you're so sexy, I can not
expected to prove again.

73
00:05:41,727 --> 00:05:43,753
I just shave.

74
00:05:48,005 --> 00:05:49,325
What the hell?

75
00:05:51,635 --> 00:05:52,654
Who was it?

76
00:05:52,655 --> 00:05:53,751
My secretary.

77
00:05:53,752 --> 00:05:55,071
Her boyfriend hit her again.

78
00:05:55,072 --> 00:05:56,396
Who the hell was that?

79
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,173
Who wants to prove?

80
00:05:59,092 --> 00:06:00,162
Steven?

81
00:06:00,638 --> 00:06:01,666
Were you listening?

82
00:06:01,667 --> 00:06:03,123
Who cares?

83
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:07,579
Is there a guy who wants to prove
and you're just shave?

84
00:06:07,580 --> 00:06:08,580
I did it for you.

85
00:06:08,581 --> 00:06:09,910
Who was it?

86
00:06:09,911 --> 00:06:10,911
No matter.

87
00:06:13,531 --> 00:06:16,604
I love the bracelet and
I'll give you your gift.

88
00:06:17,696 --> 00:06:19,297
Chloe, it's serious.

89
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:22,079
For whom did you shave?

90
00:06:22,835 --> 00:06:24,224
For you Steven.

91
00:06:24,225 --> 00:06:25,566
I did it for you.

92
00:06:31,508 --> 00:06:32,920
Wait are hoaxes.

93
00:06:36,304 --> 00:06:37,779
Do you have sex with him?

94
00:06:41,687 --> 00:06:43,008
You did the right thing.

95
00:06:43,233 --> 00:06:47,047
I can not believe they let her
but it is right.

96
00:06:47,048 --> 00:06:48,426
I had no choice.

97
00:06:48,427 --> 00:06:49,679
I cheated.

98
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,525
Think this was the first time
the first to catch it.

99
00:06:52,526 --> 00:06:55,423
Someone so beautiful
I always cheated.

100
00:06:55,424 --> 00:06:56,540
Why?

101
00:06:56,541 --> 00:06:58,115
Did you know that I kidding?

102
00:06:58,116 --> 00:06:59,993
I did not know, but think,

103
00:06:59,994 --> 00:07:01,638
is the fantasy of every man,

104
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:06,391
all athletes, rockers, rich
we all tried ...

105
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:07,710
It is only human, Stev-o.

106
00:07:07,711 --> 00:07:08,711
Please.

107
00:07:08,712 --> 00:07:09,840
Not all cheat you.

108
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:11,856
Yes, I do.

109
00:07:12,122 --> 00:07:13,885
This is what you get for believing
at his word.

110
00:07:13,949 --> 00:07:15,547
Never heard of a model
that boat to a rock.

111
00:07:15,548 --> 00:07:17,444
Stephanie Moore buttons to Axel Rose.

112
00:07:17,445 --> 00:07:19,922
Now a billionaire,
working well.

113
00:07:21,193 --> 00:07:22,582
Whatever ...

114
00:07:22,683 --> 00:07:24,781
Passage of this ridiculous
loving circle.

115
00:07:25,447 --> 00:07:26,817
I'm better off without her.

116
00:07:27,518 --> 00:07:28,593
I did the right thing.

117
00:07:29,561 --> 00:07:31,543
I can not believe that to stay
with the cuff.

118
00:07:50,375 --> 00:07:51,717
I made the biggest mistake.

119
00:07:51,974 --> 00:07:54,213
I have to get it back,
I have to get it back!

120
00:07:54,214 --> 00:07:55,605
Not true, did the right thing.

121
00:07:55,887 --> 00:07:57,862
Be strong, hey
Clancy tell!

122
00:07:57,863 --> 00:07:59,161
If you're good.

123
00:07:59,162 --> 00:08:02,133
I know for six years
have a heart of gold ...

124
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:04,957
and a good liver,
deserve more.

125
00:08:04,958 --> 00:08:08,129
I know, they're right, but
I can not forget.

126
00:08:08,130 --> 00:08:10,181
Look at the positive side,
If you are still single.

127
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:12,906
Enough of my problems.

128
00:08:13,303 --> 00:08:15,446
What you gave Alexis
on Valentine's Day?

129
00:08:15,447 --> 00:08:17,475
A Victoria Secret robe.

130
00:08:17,807 --> 00:08:19,565
All ... "None of lingerie?

131
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:22,358
No, just a bathrobe.

132
00:08:22,359 --> 00:08:25,038
I was going to buy a set sexy
but when I entered and saw ...

133
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,534
the real size poster
of the models ...

134
00:08:28,607 --> 00:08:30,983
- And?
- Let me ruined.

135
00:08:31,698 --> 00:08:32,543
What do you say?

136
00:08:32,544 --> 00:08:35,622
If I buy will not look Alexis
Like that girl.

137
00:08:35,623 --> 00:08:37,161
I removed but the desire
sex.

138
00:08:37,162 --> 00:08:38,700
What would be the difference?
Do not have it now.

139
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:40,297
I like it.

140
00:08:41,675 --> 00:08:43,186
Chloe was like that girl.

141
00:08:43,523 --> 00:08:46,478
Whatever you say, but now
with another What's your point?

142
00:08:47,504 --> 00:08:49,264
What if I never find
someone better?

143
00:08:49,469 --> 00:08:50,910
What if it was my last hope?

144
00:08:50,911 --> 00:08:53,577
I have 28 years the rest of my life
will only be worse.

145
00:08:53,718 --> 00:08:55,064
Let me tell you something.

146
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:58,658
600 years ago we liked
fat and white.

147
00:08:58,721 --> 00:09:00,251
I mean look at the paintings.

148
00:09:00,252 --> 00:09:03,026
They would not like the skinny
Victoria Secret models.

149
00:09:03,287 --> 00:09:04,263
I'm not sure about that.

150
00:09:04,264 --> 00:09:05,992
Look at the paintings!

151
00:09:05,993 --> 00:09:09,365
"Stev-o is right.
"Forget about the paintings.

152
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,066
I have to get it back.

153
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:14,333
I'll give you another chance.

154
00:09:16,043 --> 00:09:19,036
Steven, this is the best.

155
00:09:19,037 --> 00:09:20,763
Try to tell you.

156
00:09:20,764 --> 00:09:22,622
Are you talking about, never tried
to tell me anything.

157
00:09:22,623 --> 00:09:24,609
Your own, you slept with another.

158
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:25,965
It is more than that.

159
00:09:26,927 --> 00:09:29,283
"I want.
- I can not believe it!

160
00:09:30,489 --> 00:09:31,653
Since when is going on?

161
00:09:34,135 --> 00:09:35,273
About three months ...

162
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:36,855
That's the whole quarter!

163
00:09:36,856 --> 00:09:38,747
Steven, you and me ...

164
00:09:38,748 --> 00:09:40,813
alone, we were ...

165
00:09:40,814 --> 00:09:43,150
Do not try to blame.

166
00:09:43,151 --> 00:09:45,640
You're the one cheating,
I'm just, you know ...

167
00:09:47,639 --> 00:09:49,083
Which you are forgiven.

168
00:09:55,104 --> 00:09:56,311
Steven ...

169
00:09:58,517 --> 00:09:59,977
Is over.

170
00:10:02,122 --> 00:10:03,172
To hell with it!

171
00:10:03,173 --> 00:10:06,024
Had a chance to recover
the bracelet and you left-

172
00:10:06,025 --> 00:10:07,025
Well, supposedly ...

173
00:10:07,126 --> 00:10:09,595
You should start it
cost you $ 2000.

174
00:10:09,596 --> 00:10:11,518
Jesus, this is killing me.

175
00:10:11,782 --> 00:10:14,724
- How is this guy?
"Like a Ninja.

176
00:10:14,725 --> 00:10:16,866
No matter you forget,
Quick!.

177
00:10:16,867 --> 00:10:20,187
"I've been there.
"No you do not know how you feel.

178
00:10:20,759 --> 00:10:22,780
I still love her,
I can not forget.

179
00:10:22,781 --> 00:10:25,719
Tales do not love,
just how good it looks.

180
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:27,236
Not true.
We had a connection.

181
00:10:27,327 --> 00:10:29,130
It was love and still love.

182
00:10:34,840 --> 00:10:38,069
I sleep with all women
I could to forget.

183
00:10:38,678 --> 00:10:39,692
That would not work.

184
00:10:39,693 --> 00:10:41,271
If you do, trust me.

185
00:10:42,254 --> 00:10:43,779
Need circular.

186
00:10:43,780 --> 00:10:47,260
No. If I can not have it I will
someone better.

187
00:10:50,281 --> 00:10:52,668
At least he was in the circle
nice people.

188
00:10:52,895 --> 00:10:54,436
Still stuck in the action.

189
00:10:54,437 --> 00:10:56,482
Chloe that he could not remove me.

190
00:10:56,483 --> 00:10:59,213
Thanks for having me.

191
00:10:59,214 --> 00:11:00,431
Do not thank me ...

192
00:11:00,432 --> 00:11:03,345
I did not know who ended up with Chloe.

193
00:11:03,346 --> 00:11:05,357
I had never invited
you alone.

194
00:11:06,855 --> 00:11:08,019
Thanks anyway.

195
00:11:08,398 --> 00:11:11,722
Stop thanking me
something I never would.

196
00:11:21,869 --> 00:11:23,026
Would you invite this drink?

197
00:11:25,208 --> 00:11:26,242
It's open bar.

198
00:11:26,512 --> 00:11:29,478
I know, just kidding.

199
00:11:36,523 --> 00:11:39,697
You should give more tips,
when open bar.

200
00:11:54,379 --> 00:11:57,530
I would not go
in his plane and nothing else.

201
00:11:57,531 --> 00:11:58,935
Sure, there is not even tropics.

202
00:11:58,936 --> 00:12:00,176
There is nobody in the industry.

203
00:12:00,177 --> 00:12:01,737
Erin you are right?

204
00:12:02,229 --> 00:12:03,572
Yes, Hi.

205
00:12:03,721 --> 00:12:04,681
How do you know?

206
00:12:04,682 --> 00:12:06,446
We present my ex-girlfriend
Chloe.

207
00:12:06,447 --> 00:12:07,876
We went to a party together.

208
00:12:08,542 --> 00:12:10,020
Do you still go out with ...

209
00:12:10,021 --> 00:12:11,408
eg hockey player?

210
00:12:11,792 --> 00:12:12,409
God no.

211
00:12:13,383 --> 00:12:16,112
They changed it to worse
League team.

212
00:12:17,632 --> 00:12:19,154
I repeat your name.

213
00:12:19,155 --> 00:12:20,155
Steven Goodson.

214
00:12:20,668 --> 00:12:21,789
Are you in business?.

215
00:12:21,966 --> 00:12:24,076
No, I counter.

216
00:12:24,389 --> 00:12:26,340
Do you have an office?

217
00:12:27,423 --> 00:12:30,473
No, just ... auh ...
an accountant.

218
00:12:31,303 --> 00:12:34,420
Please do not leave Chloe
with "just an accountant."

219
00:12:34,421 --> 00:12:36,378
You must have something special.

220
00:12:38,212 --> 00:12:39,632
Maybe I can bring a drink ...

221
00:12:40,296 --> 00:12:41,922
See if you can find out.

222
00:12:43,943 --> 00:12:46,347
In fact I have a commitment.

223
00:12:47,351 --> 00:12:48,365
With Leo.

224
00:12:49,444 --> 00:12:50,469
Who is Leo?

225
00:12:54,327 --> 00:12:57,016
How are supposed to know
Leo is Leonardo D'caprio?

226
00:12:57,841 --> 00:12:59,422
I do not know much.

227
00:12:59,423 --> 00:13:01,537
But among them if.
Each and every one.

228
00:13:04,645 --> 00:13:07,677
Toby, Leo, Justin,
Ashton.

229
00:13:07,815 --> 00:13:10,733
- Vince, this crap.
- I was a fool.

230
00:13:10,989 --> 00:13:13,581
It's like being on another planet
I do not speak the language.

231
00:13:14,415 --> 00:13:16,240
God never find
other as Chloe.

232
00:13:16,241 --> 00:13:20,273
Good, these gals always
make you miserable.

233
00:13:20,274 --> 00:13:21,274
Humbug.

234
00:13:21,275 --> 00:13:24,725
The guys who go with them
not seem to suffer.

235
00:13:25,111 --> 00:13:28,563
Clear is that among girls
vacationing in St. Tropez ...

236
00:13:28,876 --> 00:13:31,807
or record an album or
buy another company.

237
00:13:31,808 --> 00:13:33,807
You do not even have a car.

238
00:13:38,100 --> 00:13:40,609
I hate this game never should
tell my father I'm good.

239
00:13:40,610 --> 00:13:41,610
Think about it.

240
00:13:41,611 --> 00:13:43,265
Could play the role.

241
00:13:43,457 --> 00:13:46,770
I rent the car right,
change my clothes, invention ...

242
00:13:46,771 --> 00:13:49,117
A good story
my life.

243
00:13:49,785 --> 00:13:51,158
As you Stev-o ...

244
00:13:51,159 --> 00:13:52,221
Only hurt you.

245
00:13:53,123 --> 00:13:54,365
No, I can not.

246
00:13:55,605 --> 00:13:56,963
I can do.

247
00:14:12,533 --> 00:14:13,538
What happens?

248
00:14:13,539 --> 00:14:14,539
What was it?

249
00:14:18,100 --> 00:14:19,253
Are you talking to me?

250
00:14:21,429 --> 00:14:22,546
Are you talking to me?

251
00:14:23,748 --> 00:14:25,569
Clear that the grant is mine.

252
00:14:26,271 --> 00:14:27,350
What is that?

253
00:14:27,841 --> 00:14:30,264
I did by hand in Paris.

254
00:14:31,163 --> 00:14:32,180
Like it?

255
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:35,065
It fits well.
It fits well.

256
00:14:35,066 --> 00:14:37,373
Bought companies in bankruptcy and
the dismantled.

257
00:14:37,374 --> 00:14:39,317
It's very good business
very good.

258
00:14:39,318 --> 00:14:40,318
What happens?

259
00:14:40,679 --> 00:14:41,979
I am a producer.

260
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,451
I'm making movies
one with Toby, Leo and Ben.

261
00:14:45,452 --> 00:14:47,044
Vince, the boys.

262
00:14:47,755 --> 00:14:49,363
Built homes in Sun Valley.

263
00:14:49,364 --> 00:14:50,504
For the stars.

264
00:14:50,654 --> 00:14:52,371
Just go to "Goldie gym" ...

265
00:14:52,372 --> 00:14:53,917
... Or Christmas party.

266
00:14:55,061 --> 00:14:58,028
... Nothing to see,
we recorded.

267
00:14:58,303 --> 00:15:00,597
We also make me known,
you make me known.

268
00:15:00,941 --> 00:15:02,821
Does the gym?
Does the gym?

269
00:15:03,637 --> 00:15:05,468
No, yoga, St. Bartz.

270
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:08,632
St. Bartz, I love it.

271
00:15:08,633 --> 00:15:09,633
Step around the summer.

272
00:15:09,634 --> 00:15:11,842
Aspen is fine, but
Sun Valley is better.

273
00:15:12,188 --> 00:15:14,736
Less massive, but
privacy.

274
00:15:15,979 --> 00:15:18,118
You know, you've gone
Want to go?

275
00:15:18,394 --> 00:15:20,216
Come on my plane,
Come to me ...!

276
00:15:21,749 --> 00:15:24,387
... Aircraft.
I have a plane.

277
00:15:28,575 --> 00:15:30,075
Seasonal.

278
00:15:31,725 --> 00:15:33,328
- Name please.
- Steven G.

279
00:15:37,122 --> 00:15:39,247
Sorry, pal,
are not on the list.

280
00:15:39,780 --> 00:15:41,287
I fly from Geneva

281
00:15:41,381 --> 00:15:43,957
My schedule is brutal,
forget to call my office.

282
00:15:44,783 --> 00:15:46,936
Look, excuse the inconvenience.

283
00:15:47,775 --> 00:15:49,628
Right, let it go.

284
00:15:51,173 --> 00:15:52,880
- Are you kidding.
- Fifteen minutes.

285
00:15:53,859 --> 00:15:56,241
Wow you are a man
busy.

286
00:15:56,242 --> 00:15:57,834
Yes, I like to stay busy.

287
00:15:58,177 --> 00:16:00,116
At some point
and not about the money ...

288
00:16:00,117 --> 00:16:01,783
It's about leaving a legacy.

289
00:16:02,535 --> 00:16:03,953
What you mean.

290
00:16:05,386 --> 00:16:08,379
Listen, I was invited
to this party late ...

291
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,019
and I really would like to invite you but ...

292
00:16:11,843 --> 00:16:13,501
not if it's okay.

293
00:16:18,929 --> 00:16:20,637
Is for Matt and Ben.

294
00:16:20,638 --> 00:16:21,638
Are in the city.

295
00:16:22,854 --> 00:16:23,839
Who?

296
00:16:24,520 --> 00:16:25,609
Matt and Ben?

297
00:16:25,679 --> 00:16:27,186
Okay.

298
00:16:27,322 --> 00:16:28,617
We have the same manager.

299
00:16:29,123 --> 00:16:30,257
Really?

300
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:31,830
Who?

301
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:37,177
Haiment Rott.

302
00:16:40,616 --> 00:16:41,561
Oh, yeah.

303
00:16:41,638 --> 00:16:43,993
I think I met him
at a party.

304
00:16:48,831 --> 00:16:51,912
I felt like a cheat but
I release of the cubicle ...

305
00:16:51,913 --> 00:16:53,445
and return to the world
the Chloes,

306
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:55,757
I saw men
with envy again.

307
00:16:55,759 --> 00:16:58,808
and women saw me
as if it was special.

308
00:17:11,057 --> 00:17:12,542
A kiss on the cheek?

309
00:17:13,408 --> 00:17:15,650
Well, I invite you to come.

310
00:17:15,767 --> 00:17:17,350
But at least it was in the game.

311
00:17:18,062 --> 00:17:19,715
It was only a matter of time.

312
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:21,506
I already spend a week.

313
00:17:21,682 --> 00:17:23,813
I left her three messages
and does not answer.

314
00:17:23,814 --> 00:17:24,814
I'm going to kill someone.

315
00:17:25,378 --> 00:17:27,772
- It must realize that lying.
- Impossible.

316
00:17:27,773 --> 00:17:30,668
As explained to the department
a room.

317
00:17:30,669 --> 00:17:35,038
I said I was remodeling
my Penthouse and I hate hotels.

318
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:37,515
- Perhaps the name is George Clooney.
- What are you talking about?

319
00:17:37,516 --> 00:17:39,318
You're out of your element,
she can feel it.

320
00:17:39,319 --> 00:17:41,120
Only going to play with you.

321
00:17:41,121 --> 00:17:42,511
Hey I had some action.

322
00:17:42,512 --> 00:17:45,806
These women are for men
with beautiful girls.

323
00:17:45,807 --> 00:17:48,494
Releasing different ...
Pheromones.

324
00:17:48,495 --> 00:17:49,845
Please this is not true.

325
00:17:49,846 --> 00:17:52,383
As lesbians kiss and you have
3 years out of the game.

326
00:17:52,384 --> 00:17:53,697
What should I do?

327
00:17:53,698 --> 00:17:54,860
Calm down.

328
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:56,717
Calm the nerves.

329
00:17:56,745 --> 00:17:58,900
Reencuéntrate.

330
00:17:59,001 --> 00:18:00,798
With your heart healed.

331
00:18:01,235 --> 00:18:03,211
Who are the new
Dr. Heart?

332
00:18:03,212 --> 00:18:05,305
I try to help Steven
and do not listen.

333
00:18:05,673 --> 00:18:07,355
Need return
to the minor leagues.

334
00:18:07,356 --> 00:18:09,388
Need to practice
regain your confidence.

335
00:18:09,677 --> 00:18:12,379
And then maybe get another
Chloe no lies.

336
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:13,380
I hate lying.

337
00:18:13,381 --> 00:18:14,689
Of course it is.

338
00:18:14,690 --> 00:18:16,344
- You're not well.
- I know.

339
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:18,146
I hate pretending to be someone else.

340
00:18:18,147 --> 00:18:20,662
And those with income of $ 1.800
truck.

341
00:18:20,663 --> 00:18:23,214
And watch for $ 9.000
plus I've given gifts.

342
00:18:23,215 --> 00:18:26,407
So much for a little action
and one case of blue balls.

343
00:18:26,408 --> 00:18:28,722
Yes, but not find another one
Chloe in the minors.

344
00:18:28,723 --> 00:18:32,938
Then give a model but not
are ready or your bank account.

345
00:18:32,939 --> 00:18:35,090
Then go with 6 and 7's
is the answer.

346
00:18:35,091 --> 00:18:36,406
No, of course not.

347
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:39,670
Forget the talk of June 7's
4 and 5's and it is a solution.

348
00:18:40,299 --> 00:18:41,437
Do you feel better?

349
00:18:41,438 --> 00:18:42,676
No, not really.

350
00:18:43,230 --> 00:18:44,876
But thanks for support.

351
00:18:44,877 --> 00:18:46,268
No problem
Old loves me.

352
00:18:46,545 --> 00:18:47,568
Since when?

353
00:18:48,721 --> 00:18:50,455
Come home tonight
Alexis will ...

354
00:18:50,456 --> 00:18:52,720
Bruce and Rich Invite
smoke weed ...

355
00:18:52,721 --> 00:18:55,589
City of the vice play my
$ 7.000 screen.

356
00:18:55,590 --> 00:18:57,895
You know I can not stand
the Playstacion ...

357
00:18:57,896 --> 00:19:01,358
Since I played 40 hours.
Better go to the movies.

358
00:19:01,359 --> 00:19:03,637
Only on a Friday night
look like a loser.

359
00:19:03,638 --> 00:19:04,638
Yes.

360
00:19:08,718 --> 00:19:11,041
Those uniforms are so bad.

361
00:19:16,180 --> 00:19:17,839
These journals are the devil.

362
00:19:18,963 --> 00:19:21,142
- Why these well.
- It's so pretty.

363
00:19:21,143 --> 00:19:22,143
How much?

364
00:19:22,144 --> 00:19:24,398
-Triple A.
- White or general.

365
00:19:24,399 --> 00:19:25,399
Club house.

366
00:19:25,400 --> 00:19:27,801
"Three years in prison
by one with Heidi?

367
00:19:27,802 --> 00:19:29,928
Backward one year in prison
three with her.

368
00:19:30,030 --> 00:19:32,331
But I speak of all dances,
massage ...

369
00:19:32,332 --> 00:19:35,091
As Robert Downey Jr.
DVD cell phone ...

370
00:19:35,465 --> 00:19:36,525
And what about you?

371
00:19:36,526 --> 00:19:38,253
Forget it, I'm not going to prison.

372
00:19:38,461 --> 00:19:41,167
But it could cut
the little finger to know Cleaver.

373
00:19:42,008 --> 00:19:43,143
You're sick.

374
00:19:43,695 --> 00:19:45,809
And do not you? these obsessed.

375
00:19:46,361 --> 00:19:50,118
What about those girls lists
university ...

376
00:19:50,119 --> 00:19:53,484
of good family, straight teeth
and go to the gym,

377
00:19:53,485 --> 00:19:54,485
and not give them the time, right?

378
00:19:54,904 --> 00:19:56,962
Want a perfect body

379
00:19:56,963 --> 00:19:58,653
I leave school ...

380
00:19:58,654 --> 00:20:00,837
slept with a photographer
and became a model, right?

381
00:20:00,838 --> 00:20:02,957
Is it what you want?,
That is wrong.

382
00:20:02,958 --> 00:20:05,000
What's wrong?
Why do not I want that?

383
00:20:05,928 --> 00:20:09,239
Why you brainwashed
grew up with Playboy ...

384
00:20:09,240 --> 00:20:11,869
and now they must all
Apparently models.

385
00:20:11,870 --> 00:20:13,878
Selling everything
You know you want to buy?

386
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:14,879
To them.

387
00:20:18,197 --> 00:20:19,212
Then we will see.

388
00:20:20,138 --> 00:20:22,060
When less is
an action movie.

389
00:20:23,808 --> 00:20:25,123
Lost love.

390
00:21:04,691 --> 00:21:06,054
They ran out of candy.

391
00:21:06,055 --> 00:21:08,573
So I brought gummy bears.

392
00:21:08,949 --> 00:21:10,542
Honey.

393
00:21:11,681 --> 00:21:14,709
This is one of the greatest movies
romantic of all time.

394
00:21:24,544 --> 00:21:26,544
- What are you doing here?
- I want the bracelet.

395
00:21:26,545 --> 00:21:27,545
What?

396
00:21:27,546 --> 00:21:29,213
- Why?
- Just bring it here I hope.

397
00:21:29,219 --> 00:21:30,444
Steven was a gift.

398
00:21:30,445 --> 00:21:31,146
No, no.

399
00:21:31,147 --> 00:21:34,162
Every time you wear will
like to announce that I'm a loser

400
00:21:34,509 --> 00:21:36,991
Like a neon sign,
Steven is a loser.

401
00:21:36,992 --> 00:21:39,590
Steven is a loser!
Steven is a loser!

402
00:21:39,591 --> 00:21:40,577
Are you high?

403
00:21:40,578 --> 00:21:41,817
Only brings the cuff.

404
00:21:42,557 --> 00:21:44,768
Okay I'll return.

405
00:21:53,580 --> 00:21:54,340
Toma.

406
00:21:54,930 --> 00:21:56,667
Do not want the drag
back.

407
00:21:57,996 --> 00:21:59,900
You shave for.

408
00:22:05,017 --> 00:22:06,750
It was wrong from the beginning.

409
00:22:06,751 --> 00:22:07,751
What are you talking about?

410
00:22:07,752 --> 00:22:09,366
Chloe is too old for you.

411
00:22:09,367 --> 00:22:11,245
Is 18 months younger
I, Jack.

412
00:22:12,097 --> 00:22:13,363
It is not enough.

413
00:22:13,364 --> 00:22:15,866
The formula is half
your age plus seven, right?.

414
00:22:15,867 --> 00:22:18,015
You're just three years
greater than Alexis.

415
00:22:18,265 --> 00:22:22,194
But he makes up his dad
my place in the company.

416
00:22:22,195 --> 00:22:24,564
I wish I had not heard
I was with another.

417
00:22:24,565 --> 00:22:26,523
As they say ignorance
is a blessing.

418
00:22:26,524 --> 00:22:28,663
True, stupid
are the happiest.

419
00:22:28,877 --> 00:22:31,731
And those who have no ambitions.
They are fortunate.

420
00:22:31,732 --> 00:22:33,676
They say I have a truck,
I'm so happy.

421
00:22:33,677 --> 00:22:34,677
I do not mean that.

422
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,741
By Mick Jager,
was her birthday yesterday.

423
00:22:38,742 --> 00:22:39,742
So what?

424
00:22:39,743 --> 00:22:40,921
She puts on pants
one leg at a time ...

425
00:22:40,922 --> 00:22:43,701
and go to the bathroom after eating
like all of us....

426
00:22:43,702 --> 00:22:44,702
What was your wish?

427
00:22:44,703 --> 00:22:45,703
I have no idea.

428
00:22:45,704 --> 00:22:47,157
Like every year.

429
00:22:47,158 --> 00:22:49,689
- What?
- Being Mick Jager another year.

430
00:22:49,690 --> 00:22:50,901
They are fools.

431
00:22:50,902 --> 00:22:53,039
Mick has it all
a beautiful wife ...

432
00:22:53,040 --> 00:22:54,805
Ex-wife beautiful
beautiful brides.

433
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:56,083
Never queue.

434
00:22:56,084 --> 00:22:58,916
He does not care bills,
everything is solved.

435
00:22:59,205 --> 00:23:01,653
It does not fly in coach from
sixties.

436
00:23:01,654 --> 00:23:04,716
Some model has launched a
Mick Jager. Never!

437
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:06,162
And that makes you happy?

438
00:23:06,791 --> 00:23:08,421
- Sure.
- Absolutely.

439
00:23:08,597 --> 00:23:11,557
They have much to learn,
it is not nonsense.

440
00:23:11,773 --> 00:23:15,733
If it can be without seeing one
great hair, great lips ...

441
00:23:15,734 --> 00:23:17,415
but a respectable man,
okay.

442
00:23:17,591 --> 00:23:18,456
But if not.

443
00:23:18,457 --> 00:23:20,948
The worship of the "Fans"
is useless.

444
00:23:21,133 --> 00:23:24,440
In the end only about
a good friend at your funeral.

445
00:23:26,423 --> 00:23:28,916
What the hell are you talking about?
Keith has.

446
00:23:29,243 --> 00:23:31,523
I just hope, I pray ...

447
00:23:31,524 --> 00:23:33,757
That all stars are
rock at one of their lives.

448
00:23:34,485 --> 00:23:36,014
For reincarnation.

449
00:23:39,269 --> 00:23:41,142
Thank you very much for coming.

450
00:23:41,143 --> 00:23:43,989
I'm so glad to see them.
Be right back.

451
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:44,990
- Okay.
- Okay.

452
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:48,203
You came, thanks.

453
00:23:48,204 --> 00:23:49,204
Goodbye.

454
00:23:50,761 --> 00:23:51,970
Jack ...

455
00:23:53,085 --> 00:23:55,177
Do you gave your
siblings alcohol?

456
00:23:56,861 --> 00:23:58,548
Just a bit of vodka, honey.

457
00:23:58,549 --> 00:24:00,522
Jack, have 10 years.

458
00:24:01,186 --> 00:24:02,659
They have to grow.

459
00:24:05,337 --> 00:24:07,602
- Come on Jack, we live together.
- Of course dear.

460
00:24:07,603 --> 00:24:09,054
All his friends.

461
00:24:10,363 --> 00:24:11,555
Boys.

462
00:24:16,463 --> 00:24:18,318
I can not believe
this is happening.

463
00:24:19,443 --> 00:24:21,621
Hell must be very
cold at this time.

464
00:24:25,185 --> 00:24:26,471
Hi, how are you?

465
00:24:26,472 --> 00:24:28,124
Quickly, my father wants
make a toast.

466
00:24:30,432 --> 00:24:32,273
What is she doing here?
Steven will come.

467
00:24:32,274 --> 00:24:33,780
I have no idea.

468
00:24:35,310 --> 00:24:36,695
I hope not to come.

469
00:24:37,068 --> 00:24:38,615
- Hello.
- I'm glad you came.

470
00:24:40,345 --> 00:24:43,761
Not if you know my daughter
and her fiance.

471
00:24:44,088 --> 00:24:46,744
A pleasure, your father always
about you.

472
00:24:47,034 --> 00:24:48,320
You're lucky.

473
00:24:49,062 --> 00:24:51,542
- She is my girlfriend, Chloe.
- If you know Chloe.

474
00:24:53,333 --> 00:24:54,844
Congratulations Jack.

475
00:24:56,411 --> 00:24:58,035
Hey, it's time for toast.

476
00:24:59,479 --> 00:25:00,870
I can pay attention
please.

477
00:25:00,871 --> 00:25:01,871
All.

478
00:25:04,066 --> 00:25:07,822
First, we want to thank
you all for joining.

479
00:25:08,270 --> 00:25:10,720
I would like to wish
my lovely daughter ...

480
00:25:10,897 --> 00:25:15,160
and my future son-a
long and happy life together.

481
00:25:15,161 --> 00:25:16,703
... With many children.

482
00:25:17,932 --> 00:25:19,294
I can not believe
I ad ...!

483
00:25:19,295 --> 00:25:21,135
As you would know that
her boyfriend is customer

484
00:25:21,136 --> 00:25:22,136
I'm as surprised as you.

485
00:25:22,137 --> 00:25:23,137
I doubt it!

486
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:25,963
I'm going to look like an idiot
I better go.

487
00:25:25,964 --> 00:25:26,964
Would you calm down?

488
00:25:26,965 --> 00:25:28,942
The best thing to do is
win a girl ...

489
00:25:28,943 --> 00:25:29,943
and bring you home.

490
00:25:29,944 --> 00:25:32,090
He is two inches
taller than me!

491
00:25:32,091 --> 00:25:34,460
Listen, it's improvement.

492
00:25:34,461 --> 00:25:35,461
What are you talking about?

493
00:25:35,462 --> 00:25:38,049
Not depressed. But is the classic
change for someone better.

494
00:25:38,050 --> 00:25:40,414
He is older, taller,

495
00:25:40,415 --> 00:25:42,676
Slightly ...
better looking.

496
00:25:42,677 --> 00:25:45,418
and if the old client,
has more money.

497
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:46,419
Never exceeds.

498
00:25:46,420 --> 00:25:49,033
To hell with Chloe, she'll boto
and he bounced.

499
00:25:49,034 --> 00:25:50,034
Karma is bouncing.

500
00:25:50,716 --> 00:25:53,304
In five years the damned
will have more money ...

501
00:25:53,305 --> 00:25:55,860
looking for something better
a fool for 19 years ...

502
00:25:55,861 --> 00:25:58,571
fresh off the bus
and will be on it.

503
00:25:58,785 --> 00:26:01,422
And you will see Chloe with her tits
hanging and fallen back ...

504
00:26:01,423 --> 00:26:03,493
Talking to herself
Bloomindales's outside.

505
00:26:03,494 --> 00:26:04,996
I can not wait that long,
I must do something now.

506
00:26:04,997 --> 00:26:06,946
Then do something big
looking for adventure ...

507
00:26:06,947 --> 00:26:08,270
and college.
Spring Break.

508
00:26:08,271 --> 00:26:10,036
Sleep with as many as possible
in a week.

509
00:26:10,037 --> 00:26:11,201
I never wanted adventures.

510
00:26:11,202 --> 00:26:14,224
Kidding second in La Isla
the father was phenomenal ...

511
00:26:14,225 --> 00:26:15,294
Three girls that week.

512
00:26:15,295 --> 00:26:17,210
Secondly I had mononucleosis.

513
00:26:17,864 --> 00:26:21,159
Well, last year eight girls Cancun
in six nights. Remember?

514
00:26:21,160 --> 00:26:22,927
No, I went skiing with my parents.

515
00:26:25,436 --> 00:26:28,198
Well it would not be good friend
if she did not tell the truth ...

516
00:26:29,202 --> 00:26:30,995
've Had very few women.

517
00:26:31,473 --> 00:26:33,792
Jack and Chloe is the choice if ...

518
00:26:33,793 --> 00:26:35,106
That's the one chosen does not exist.

519
00:26:35,107 --> 00:26:38,001
It is the biggest lie
is worse than the Bible.

520
00:26:38,066 --> 00:26:40,734
- You are very bad for him.
- Okay, okay.

521
00:26:40,735 --> 00:26:42,363
But you come with me.

522
00:26:42,364 --> 00:26:44,890
I'm committed, I
my party of $ 300,000.

523
00:26:44,891 --> 00:26:46,054
Then do not do it without you.

524
00:26:46,534 --> 00:26:47,689
Still out there.

525
00:26:49,085 --> 00:26:50,481
See, look at that.

526
00:26:50,482 --> 00:26:52,282
Did you see that?

527
00:26:52,283 --> 00:26:54,125
They all look like
if he were the man.

528
00:26:54,343 --> 00:26:56,072
I was the man
I went for three years.

529
00:26:56,437 --> 00:26:57,662
Fucking whore.

530
00:26:58,441 --> 00:26:59,990
Just forget it, do you want?

531
00:27:00,128 --> 00:27:01,413
Go for adventure.

532
00:27:02,340 --> 00:27:03,551
It kills me.

533
00:27:13,345 --> 00:27:14,397
My God!

534
00:27:15,889 --> 00:27:17,588
Do not you want both
like me Chloe.

535
00:27:17,955 --> 00:27:19,342
I could not ...

536
00:27:19,856 --> 00:27:21,157
nobody could.

537
00:27:21,946 --> 00:27:23,074
Steven, sorry.

538
00:27:23,851 --> 00:27:25,343
I love you too.

539
00:27:25,482 --> 00:27:27,463
You're right is a girl.

540
00:27:29,382 --> 00:27:31,775
Chloe, what are you doing?

541
00:27:34,769 --> 00:27:35,623
Hello?

542
00:27:37,340 --> 00:27:38,561
I have to do something.

543
00:27:38,662 --> 00:27:39,488
A break ...

544
00:27:40,135 --> 00:27:41,044

545
00:27:45,962 --> 00:27:47,623

546
00:27:50,842 --> 00:27:52,560
Steven, what's wrong?

547
00:28:02,425 --> 00:28:03,756
Excuse me.

548
00:28:04,021 --> 00:28:06,057
Do not worry.
We all passed.

549
00:28:06,619 --> 00:28:08,741
I'm sorry about Chloe.

550
00:28:08,742 --> 00:28:09,742
Hope you are well.

551
00:28:09,743 --> 00:28:11,299

556
00:28:23,712 --> 00:28:26,775
Not ready to be alone,

557
00:28:27,328 --> 00:28:30,170

00:28:30,171 --> 00:28:31,759
-Jack is fine.
"No, not right.

We love a quick drink
I go home and hug you.

561
00:28:38,179 --> 00:28:41,278
Good, but not too late.

562
00:28:41,304 --> 00:28:42,392
You're the best.

The university is the definition
minor league.

565
00:28:53,478 --> 00:28:56,070
And you think to conquer
without lying like crazy?

566
00:28:56,283 --> 00:28:58,455
These girls are scheduled
from primary ...

567
00:28:58,456 --> 00:29:00,935

every adventure.

568
00:29:00,936 --> 00:29:03,526
Put them together with a couple of kamikaze
and looks promising.

569
00:29:04,899 --> 00:29:06,291
Okay.

570
00:29:09,568 --> 00:29:10,835
How about that?

571
00:29:12,102 --> 00:29:13,350
It looks very old.

572
00:29:15,178 --> 00:29:17,488
Okay, How about it?

573
00:29:18,791 --> 00:29:21,586
His eyebrows are ...

574
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:28,798
How about that girl?

575
00:29:30,063 --> 00:29:31,235
Very muscular.

576
00:29:31,236 --> 00:29:32,517
Are you kidding? Make up your mind.

577
00:29:34,530 --> 00:29:35,803
And one of those?

578
00:29:38,829 --> 00:29:40,310
Not know what to say.

579
00:29:40,311 --> 00:29:42,851
It is not what you say,
is as you say.

580
00:29:42,852 --> 00:29:44,099
No matter what comes out of your mouth ...

581
00:29:44,100 --> 00:29:47,933
Repeat in your mind
I'll sleep with her.

582
00:29:47,934 --> 00:29:49,886
They feel it

583
00:29:50,252 --> 00:29:52,651
- And that's all.
- Yes, but you must believe.

584
00:29:53,579 --> 00:29:54,527
Okay.

585
00:29:55,604 --> 00:29:57,096
Okay, I'm coming.

586
00:29:59,958 --> 00:30:02,695
I'll sleep with her.
I'll sleep with her.

587
00:30:03,211 --> 00:30:04,498
I'll sleep with her.

588
00:30:04,750 --> 00:30:05,969
I'll sleep with her.

589
00:30:07,947 --> 00:30:09,258
It was so romantic.

590
00:30:10,160 --> 00:30:11,927
I wanted to kiss him.

591
00:30:13,268 --> 00:30:14,858
This type dresses
as my stepfather.

592
00:30:14,859 --> 00:30:16,554
- Hello.
- Hello.

593
00:30:18,760 --> 00:30:20,478

595
00:30:21,866 --> 00:30:22,866
Really?

596
00:30:25,968 --> 00:30:27,479
And how you lived here?

597
00:30:27,480 --> 00:30:29,038
Can you believe this guy?

598
00:30:29,201 --> 00:30:32,011
Two years, I'll second.

599
00:30:32,012 --> 00:30:32,950
It's great.

600
00:30:36,150 --> 00:30:38,134
"Y. .. and how old are you?

601
00:30:41,835 --> 00:30:44,273
Where are you?
How much have you lived here?

602
00:30:44,274 --> 00:30:46,339
How old are you?
Want to have sex?

603
00:30:47,697 --> 00:30:49,245
They all say the same thing.

604
00:30:50,585 --> 00:30:52,960
What I can say?
I just want to know.

605
00:30:55,391 --> 00:30:56,682
It gets worse.

606
00:30:56,747 --> 00:30:58,335
You want me to tell you ...

607
00:30:58,336 --> 00:31:00,438
to tell me to conquer?

608
00:31:02,206 --> 00:31:04,337
Need new lines, Chachi.

609
00:31:06,729 --> 00:31:07,827
What's cruel, right?

610
00:31:08,676 --> 00:31:10,242
And your a bore.

611
00:31:12,952 --> 00:31:14,753
Rot.

612
00:31:22,576 --> 00:31:25,363
As I said, had
a beautiful car.

613
00:31:26,025 --> 00:31:27,387
How did it go?

614
00:31:29,515 --> 00:31:30,661
Have boyfriends.

615
00:31:30,686 --> 00:31:33,978
The devil is, half
the girls are from D.F.

616
00:31:34,491 --> 00:31:35,965
How do you know?

617
00:31:36,404 --> 00:31:38,329
That are too easy.

618
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,020
Stev-o she's Amy wish

619
00:31:41,021 --> 00:31:42,222

Nice to meet you.

621
00:31:44,026 --> 00:31:45,255
I'm from Omaha.

622
00:31:46,971 --> 00:31:49,091
Jack, I'll go,
I finished.

623
00:31:49,092 --> 00:31:52,071
I feel like in a barrel
breasts and I lick my finger.

624
00:31:53,834 --> 00:31:55,483
Sorry, you bring us another round.

625
00:31:55,773 --> 00:31:57,115
I'm not a waitress.

626
00:31:57,368 --> 00:31:58,690
I baby bar.

627
00:32:00,439 --> 00:32:02,821
Wow, how about it?

00:32:02,822 --> 00:32:04,382
If and big butt.

629
00:32:04,596 --> 00:32:06,236
Best, the others are very nice.

630
00:32:06,851 --> 00:32:08,034
That was cruel.

631
00:32:08,035 --> 00:32:10,100
Just imagine what they say about me.

632
00:32:10,617 --> 00:32:13,953
Baby, you have a beautiful ass,
I hope to see him naked.

633
00:32:14,323 --> 00:32:15,781
I better get that drink.

634
00:32:15,782 --> 00:32:17,944
I bring,
then I go.

635
00:32:27,019 --> 00:32:30,060
You're not very smart
for a college bar.

636
00:32:30,876 --> 00:32:32,530
Is that we come to your party
commitment.

637
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:34,553
That is admirable.

638
00:32:34,554 --> 00:32:37,070
What they have done after
wedding to go to a nude bar?

639
00:32:37,777 --> 00:32:39,217
Is a possibility.

640
00:32:40,143 --> 00:32:42,105
You are as stupid as your friend.

641
00:32:43,182 --> 00:32:46,742
No, I have not understand
heartbroken. I'm sad.

642
00:32:47,791 --> 00:32:51,126
So I decided to conquer
university to heal your ego.

643
00:32:51,954 --> 00:32:54,787
Yes, but as it went wrong.

644
00:32:55,452 --> 00:32:56,800
Well, do not worry ...

645
00:32:57,108 --> 00:32:58,358
the night is young,

646
00:32:58,505 --> 00:33:00,497
and the girls will
more drunk.

647
00:33:00,674 --> 00:33:01,649
And more stupid.

648
00:33:03,264 --> 00:33:04,355
There is a.

649
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,666
Not bad.

650
00:33:10,067 --> 00:33:12,254
Go for it,
have input ...

651
00:33:13,755 --> 00:33:15,181
Turn it on smoking.

652
00:33:16,070 --> 00:33:17,373
You fire.

653
00:33:18,578 --> 00:33:19,786
Happy hunting.

654
00:33:25,107 --> 00:33:27,849
I'll sleep with her.
I'll sleep with her.

655
00:33:27,850 --> 00:33:29,582
I'll sleep with her.

656
00:33:30,397 --> 00:33:34,292
Not yet.
Not yet

657
00:33:38,976 --> 00:33:41,624
Dale, hard.

658
00:33:41,764 --> 00:33:44,224
Not yet.

659
00:33:44,225 --> 00:33:47,904
Not yet!

660
00:33:48,193 --> 00:33:49,919
Siii!

661
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:53,218
I had not planned
if I had not bathed.

662
00:33:53,745 --> 00:33:54,534
Do not worry.

663
00:33:54,535 --> 00:33:58,948
That was really ...
phenomenal.

664
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:02,852
You can stay if you want.

665
00:34:02,853 --> 00:34:05,532
Go through, very nice.

666
00:34:05,533 --> 00:34:08,817
I do not say so, I'm happy
if you want to stay.

667
00:34:08,818 --> 00:34:10,317
No, really sweet.

668
00:34:10,318 --> 00:34:13,981
But if I stay after
I never sleep well.

669
00:34:13,982 --> 00:34:15,033
It is not personal.

670
00:34:15,034 --> 00:34:16,034
Okay.

671
00:34:18,891 --> 00:34:20,141
Do you make this much?

672
00:34:20,732 --> 00:34:23,764
If I do what I do,
I do not feel guilty.

673
00:34:24,880 --> 00:34:28,383
Also after
the redhead vomit ...

674
00:34:28,384 --> 00:34:30,225
I knew that'd be a sitting duck.

675
00:34:30,739 --> 00:34:32,185
And very cute.

676
00:34:32,681 --> 00:34:35,282
It had nothing to do what
I said your cute belly button.

677
00:34:36,146 --> 00:34:37,273
If precious.

678
00:34:39,148 --> 00:34:41,360
Hey let
you clarify a bit.

679
00:34:41,649 --> 00:34:42,712
Most of the time ...

680
00:34:43,277 --> 00:34:45,005
When you think
conquered a girl ...

681
00:34:45,006 --> 00:34:46,358
she actually chose you.

682
00:34:46,911 --> 00:34:50,825
Has nothing to do with
the lies they tell,

683
00:34:50,826 --> 00:34:52,927
it ... itchy,

684
00:34:53,462 --> 00:34:55,536
needs to be scratched.

685
00:34:56,239 --> 00:34:58,634
God take three months
sleep with Chloe.

686
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:04,340
Not all dogs are models
do it for comfort.

687
00:35:05,334 --> 00:35:06,723
Some of us ...

688
00:35:06,724 --> 00:35:08,852
Like we just go to bed.

689
00:35:16,165 --> 00:35:17,278
I love you so much.

690
00:35:25,933 --> 00:35:29,360
I will try a new design
I hope on Monday.

691
00:35:29,679 --> 00:35:30,753
I want you inside me.

692
00:35:35,232 --> 00:35:36,245
Fucking whore.

693
00:35:38,206 --> 00:35:39,923
I can not believe not forgotten.

694
00:35:46,653 --> 00:35:48,182
How did it go with Alexis?

695
00:35:48,434 --> 00:35:50,911
He stayed on the couch
to wait ...

696
00:35:50,912 --> 00:35:51,912
watching Rainman.

697
00:35:52,365 --> 00:35:53,687
What is so angry?

698
00:35:53,688 --> 00:35:54,853
Me punishment.

699
00:35:54,854 --> 00:35:56,431
Let's go shopping with her mom.

700
00:35:56,933 --> 00:36:00,278
Forget the drama. Dime
How did it go with the unknown?

701
00:36:00,830 --> 00:36:04,219
It was the first time I had sex
only for sex.

702
00:36:04,756 --> 00:36:07,422
No romance, no appointments
was not my girlfriend.

703
00:36:07,636 --> 00:36:08,609
It's exciting.

704
00:36:08,973 --> 00:36:10,615
It was a machine.

705
00:36:11,111 --> 00:36:12,666
And even this good.

706
00:36:12,667 --> 00:36:14,566
If that is the problem.

707
00:36:14,567 --> 00:36:16,105
Then I could only think of Chloe.

708
00:36:16,879 --> 00:36:18,637
Do not worry,
Get what you need.

709
00:36:18,638 --> 00:36:21,304
Each girl puts more distance
between you and Chloe.

710
00:36:22,075 --> 00:36:24,494
The more girls but forget.

711
00:36:24,783 --> 00:36:27,304
After 15 girls will feel
like a new man.

712
00:36:27,930 --> 00:36:29,946
- Do not know.
- Trust me.

713
00:36:30,462 --> 00:36:32,606
Until then these
in sexual practices.

714
00:36:32,607 --> 00:36:35,009
Now give me the details.

715
00:36:35,010 --> 00:36:36,698
How had it?.

716
00:36:42,069 --> 00:36:43,848
I go for coffee do you want?.

717
00:36:44,902 --> 00:36:47,882
Yes, of course, caffeine.

718
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:05,463
How about this?

719
00:37:05,464 --> 00:37:07,939
You look beautiful, that in great
also, baby.

720
00:37:08,453 --> 00:37:11,050
This is for lunch
before the wedding.

721
00:37:11,051 --> 00:37:13,788
The last to the party after
of the rehearsal dinner.

722
00:37:15,084 --> 00:37:17,524
I know that the two
are great, really.

723
00:37:19,257 --> 00:37:21,175
Oh and invitations.

724
00:37:21,176 --> 00:37:22,941
We must decide quickly,

725
00:37:22,942 --> 00:37:24,821
that should be ready
in less than two weeks.

726
00:37:24,890 --> 00:37:28,078
Sure, honey send samples
you love the house.

727
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:30,253
And talk
the wedding planner.

728
00:37:43,798 --> 00:37:45,820
- Hello.
- It's me, I have to talk.

729
00:37:47,458 --> 00:37:48,666
We have to go out tonight.

730
00:37:48,667 --> 00:37:50,581
See you at the bar of Clancy.

731
00:37:50,945 --> 00:37:52,415
I'm going crazy.

732
00:37:53,041 --> 00:37:56,574
It is four, Alexis is still
choosing clothes. Do not know if I can.

733
00:37:56,575 --> 00:37:58,169
There has to be late.

734
00:37:59,133 --> 00:38:00,698
Not if I can do.

735
00:38:01,426 --> 00:38:04,279
- Try, Yeah?
- No promises.

736
00:38:10,266 --> 00:38:12,287
Where is your cell mate?
Because he was late.

737
00:38:12,288 --> 00:38:15,128
No, he was with Alexis
I do not think it succeeds.

738
00:38:15,267 --> 00:38:17,553
It is like that,
my wife ...

739
00:38:17,554 --> 00:38:20,142
Go mad if he knew
I'm here.

740
00:38:20,143 --> 00:38:24,158
Do not you think that the smell of beer and
snuff and gave her a clue?.

741
00:38:24,520 --> 00:38:27,327
Know that came out,
but not where it goes.

742
00:38:27,445 --> 00:38:29,514
Think I'm at a dinner
business.

743
00:38:29,515 --> 00:38:31,859
If you are a manager at "Fifteen".
With whom would have a dinner?

744
00:38:31,860 --> 00:38:33,887
I have luck,
I questioned.

745
00:38:33,888 --> 00:38:36,733
Stev-o, do not listen
this idiots.

746
00:38:36,734 --> 00:38:38,571
Clancy as usual,
I invite this round.

747
00:38:38,572 --> 00:38:40,860
I'm about to become
in a rich fool.

748
00:38:42,467 --> 00:38:44,277
Well ready to get girls?.

749
00:38:44,278 --> 00:38:46,733
- Jack you just committed.
- Grow up, rookie.

750
00:38:48,812 --> 00:38:50,192
How do you see those beauties?.

751
00:38:51,952 --> 00:38:53,349
Well.

752
00:38:53,350 --> 00:38:56,602
These are perfect fool.
They have no more than a year.

753
00:38:58,057 --> 00:39:01,372
"I can not stay all night.
"Of course not.

754
00:39:01,662 --> 00:39:03,906
Not because you let
put the strap so short.

755
00:39:04,121 --> 00:39:07,354
Do you know how much money do you have?
How much will I have to say yes?.

756
00:39:07,355 --> 00:39:09,043
"Yes, golden cage.
-Of platinum.

757
00:39:09,044 --> 00:39:13,590
Pick a girl to dance
and get out of here.

758
00:39:18,587 --> 00:39:21,521
- Ready for my Bali?
- Yeah, right.

759
00:39:22,004 --> 00:39:24,227
In the next song.

760
00:39:25,362 --> 00:39:28,786
Hey my friend and I thought
you and a friend ...

761
00:39:28,787 --> 00:39:31,922
They want to go home later,
for drinks or something.

762
00:39:33,462 --> 00:39:35,303
If, as it were to happen.

763
00:39:35,479 --> 00:39:36,525
What?

764
00:39:37,801 --> 00:39:39,981
Come on, how much can cost
them out of here?.

765
00:39:40,270 --> 00:39:43,142
If you have to ask,
can not afford it.

766
00:39:44,596 --> 00:39:45,925
I like this.

767
00:39:46,080 --> 00:39:46,681
Dawn.

768
00:39:46,682 --> 00:39:48,222
Sinfully naughty.

769
00:39:48,223 --> 00:39:49,358
I discovered a couple of days.

770
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:52,240
Look, specialist

Very athletic, fun
open-minded.

773
00:39:57,157 --> 00:39:59,550
Lovely and I must say
very friendly.

774
00:39:59,688 --> 00:40:01,772
Significant costs
just because I'm worth it

775
00:40:01,807 --> 00:40:03,050
Sounds great.

776
00:40:03,051 --> 00:40:04,778
I can not believe how many
girls are here!.

777
00:40:05,143 --> 00:40:07,592
- What do you want?.
- Wait, that's there.

00:40:09,961 --> 00:40:12,980
Former Penthouse model,

780
00:40:12,981 --> 00:40:16,924
Elegant and sophisticated
but humble.

781
00:40:16,925 --> 00:40:19,055
Deals exclusively
gentlemen ...

782
00:40:19,056 --> 00:40:22,469
They want only the best and
appreciate the pleasures of life.

783
00:40:22,470 --> 00:40:24,157
Of that I'm talking about.
Make the call.

784
00:40:24,158 --> 00:40:25,329
I appreciate the pleasures of life.

785
00:40:25,375 --> 00:40:27,518
I can not believe we do this.

786
00:40:31,451 --> 00:40:33,601
It is now a now old
Where are they?

787
00:40:33,602 --> 00:40:36,381

Good evening gentlemen.

- What is happening?
- Do not know.

791
00:40:51,678 --> 00:40:53,099
There is a problem.

792
00:40:53,576 --> 00:40:56,212
Yes, you!.

793
00:40:57,065 --> 00:40:58,350
Where is the girl

794
00:40:59,316 --> 00:41:00,633
It's okay if you're going.

795
00:41:00,634 --> 00:41:03,264
No, wait,
let me talk a moment.

796
00:41:03,265 --> 00:41:05,113
"I'm not messing with that tank.
- I pay the two, what if?

797
00:41:05,114 --> 00:41:07,443
Only it's late, I'm going home.

798
00:41:07,444 --> 00:41:09,851
- Are you going?, Will I leave?
- Tell me tomorrow, good luck.

799
00:41:09,852 --> 00:41:11,016
Hello, you pass.

800
00:41:11,017 --> 00:41:12,296
Sorry.

801
00:41:12,992 --> 00:41:15,622
Do I owe them, girls?
$ 400 each.

802
00:41:15,725 --> 00:41:17,123
Plus tip.

803
00:41:17,124 --> 00:41:19,039
Okay, plus tip
great.

804
00:41:19,040 --> 00:41:20,695
I should give you discount.

805
00:41:20,696 --> 00:41:22,385
Or give me coupons.

806
00:41:26,882 --> 00:41:27,760
Ladies.

807
00:41:27,761 --> 00:41:29,498
Hi, how are you?

808
00:41:29,499 --> 00:41:30,570
Little tired.

809
00:41:30,571 --> 00:41:31,979
Well want something quick.

810
00:41:31,980 --> 00:41:34,758
Oral, standing ...

811
00:41:34,759 --> 00:41:35,759
What you crave?.

812
00:42:16,062 --> 00:42:17,761
He got up at 10:30.

813
00:42:17,762 --> 00:42:19,151
Then bath.

814
00:42:19,152 --> 00:42:22,827
Are you kidding? you pay to go.
Did not read the manual for prostitutes.

815
00:42:23,573 --> 00:42:26,322
We prepare ball
fresh melon.

816
00:42:28,264 --> 00:42:29,286
I'm exhausted.

817
00:42:29,287 --> 00:42:31,023
Had had morning action.

818
00:42:31,024 --> 00:42:32,902
He had no money and
believe me was not the same.

819
00:42:33,727 --> 00:42:34,700
Chloe was an angel
morning.

820
00:42:34,701 --> 00:42:38,471
You will not get girls like that
Internet, so forget it.

821
00:42:38,472 --> 00:42:39,785
- I know, I know.
- Yes.

822
00:42:40,715 --> 00:42:45,364
Steven if you forget Chloe
should be dating again.

823
00:42:45,841 --> 00:42:48,328
I have a friend Felicia,
very nice ...

824
00:42:48,329 --> 00:42:51,708
has a great job,
and great sense of humor.

825
00:42:52,299 --> 00:42:55,086
We should go out to dinner
this week.

826
00:42:57,253 --> 00:42:58,438
How is it really?

827
00:42:58,439 --> 00:43:00,280
Perfect, is a mischievous
perverted.

828
00:43:00,281 --> 00:43:03,179
I'm sure my father was so
did when at their practices.

829
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:04,464
Well.

830
00:43:07,683 --> 00:43:09,421
Here is the report of deposits.

831
00:43:16,281 --> 00:43:17,363
Steven!.

832
00:43:17,728 --> 00:43:18,883
What the hell?

833
00:43:20,259 --> 00:43:21,094
What?

834
00:43:21,495 --> 00:43:23,722
Still waiting
Snidder reporting.

835
00:43:23,723 --> 00:43:24,930
Did you finish?

836
00:43:27,603 --> 00:43:28,816
Not yet.

837
00:43:29,067 --> 00:43:30,867
I'm a little distracted.

838
00:43:30,868 --> 00:43:32,558
Remove the rear head.

839
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:36,398
Well? If you have problems
solve them in your spare time.

840
00:43:36,399 --> 00:43:37,399
Okay.

841
00:43:37,401 --> 00:43:38,400
Thanks for the support.

842
00:43:38,401 --> 00:43:41,001
If you want to see support
Alcoholics Anonymous.

843
00:43:41,002 --> 00:43:42,504
I have a department
to control.

844
00:43:42,718 --> 00:43:43,935
What is this?.

845
00:43:44,676 --> 00:43:46,505
This memo is one week.

846
00:43:46,506 --> 00:43:48,270
Clean this pigsty.

847
00:43:52,503 --> 00:43:55,104
... and flowers ...
I can not believe it.

848
00:43:55,105 --> 00:43:58,561
My father ordered hundreds
of white orchids.

849
00:43:58,562 --> 00:44:02,092
From Hawaii, come by plane
on a special flight.

850
00:44:02,093 --> 00:44:03,931
It will be the most beautiful wedding of all.

851
00:44:03,932 --> 00:44:06,635
Security comes out in magazines.

852
00:44:06,888 --> 00:44:09,939
I feel terrible for missing
your engagement party.

853
00:44:09,940 --> 00:44:12,869
I knew it was fabulous. But I could not
change my meeting in Brussels

854
00:44:12,870 --> 00:44:14,860
You seem to have
interesting work.

855
00:44:15,641 --> 00:44:19,096
Felicia is the youngest chief
the entire signature.

856
00:44:19,097 --> 00:44:20,768
And certainly much
the prettiest.

857
00:44:23,989 --> 00:44:25,612
You know? that is sexist ...

858
00:44:26,429 --> 00:44:29,957
But I feel flattered.

859
00:44:35,730 --> 00:44:36,734
Sorry.

860
00:44:41,267 --> 00:44:42,704
"By far the prettiest?.

861
00:44:43,369 --> 00:44:44,729
What was that?

862
00:44:46,148 --> 00:44:47,671
- Steven ...
- Yes.

863
00:44:48,560 --> 00:44:50,054
My God!

864
00:44:51,508 --> 00:44:52,668
"Amelia?

865
00:44:56,601 --> 00:44:58,964
We saw from ...

866
00:44:59,355 --> 00:45:00,404
Does the school?

867
00:45:03,135 --> 00:45:04,233
Epic.

868
00:45:05,123 --> 00:45:07,259
What is your life?
What do you do?

869
00:45:07,260 --> 00:45:09,853
I was in Costa Rica four years.
Teaching English.

870
00:45:10,219 --> 00:45:12,304
And now I teach second.

871
00:45:13,119 --> 00:45:15,022
And you and have you been?

872
00:45:15,023 --> 00:45:16,188
Okay.

873
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:19,360
I'm an accountant is ah ...

874
00:45:20,414 --> 00:45:21,919
whatever ...

875
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:24,421
Other than that I'm fine.
Okay.

876
00:45:26,493 --> 00:45:28,111
It's awesome.

877
00:45:29,041 --> 00:45:30,702
I am very glad to see you.

878
00:45:30,842 --> 00:45:32,918
Your wonderful light.

879
00:45:42,981 --> 00:45:45,038
Just be careful, this
in a very fragile state ...

880
00:45:45,039 --> 00:45:46,280
Friend

881
00:45:46,281 --> 00:45:47,838
- Ready for another drink.
- Yes.

882
00:45:48,647 --> 00:45:50,753
I have to go to the room
the ladies.

883
00:45:50,754 --> 00:45:52,941
- Come.
- Claro.

884
00:45:55,900 --> 00:45:57,186
Jack.

885
00:45:58,039 --> 00:45:59,122
See that girl.

886
00:46:00,501 --> 00:46:02,550
- The one with the clown.
- Yes.

887
00:46:03,254 --> 00:46:04,803
We went to school together.

888
00:46:05,094 --> 00:46:06,531
Yes? and you slept with her.

889
00:46:06,708 --> 00:46:07,694
No.

890
00:46:08,435 --> 00:46:09,965
I lacked enthusiasm.

891
00:46:09,966 --> 00:46:11,459
Not pretty.

892
00:46:11,460 --> 00:46:14,063
But it's great, it always was.

893
00:46:14,064 --> 00:46:15,530
You can not know that.

894
00:46:15,951 --> 00:46:17,813
We were classmates,
I do not speak clearly.

895
00:46:17,814 --> 00:46:20,333
Not until you meet a girl
you sleep with her.

896
00:46:20,334 --> 00:46:24,298
Until then everything is
clouded by desire.

897
00:46:27,040 --> 00:46:28,233
It's true.

898
00:46:28,469 --> 00:46:31,114
And do you think Steven
what is big?

899
00:46:33,746 --> 00:46:35,099
I have no idea.

900
00:46:35,100 --> 00:46:39,797
Come on, you have never touched
it checked.

901
00:46:40,046 --> 00:46:42,060
No! is the best friend of Jack.

902
00:46:42,061 --> 00:46:44,446
- And what, gives you no curiosity?
- No.

903
00:46:44,447 --> 00:46:45,447
Well ...

904
00:46:46,485 --> 00:46:47,790
'll Let you know.

905
00:46:56,989 --> 00:46:58,350
Wait.

906
00:46:58,351 --> 00:47:00,361
I do not want
fool yourself.

907
00:47:02,439 --> 00:47:03,628
Okay.

908
00:47:10,956 --> 00:47:14,867
Seriously, do not do that
on the first date.

909
00:47:14,868 --> 00:47:17,425
Understood,
no penetration.

910
00:47:18,887 --> 00:47:19,892
Okay.

911
00:47:21,777 --> 00:47:23,779
Want another drink?

912
00:47:23,780 --> 00:47:25,886
No, no, we do
other things.

913
00:47:27,153 --> 00:47:28,799
I make oral sex.

914
00:47:28,938 --> 00:47:31,355
But only if you also
I do.

915
00:47:35,177 --> 00:47:36,838
Seems fair.

916
00:47:53,256 --> 00:47:55,310
And so opened
gates.

917
00:47:55,495 --> 00:47:58,015
Every night out hunting.
Looking for prey.

918
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,875
For every girl who rejected me,
Seducing other five.

919
00:48:00,876 --> 00:48:02,538
- Is over.
- You must go down to the minors.

920
00:48:02,538 --> 00:48:04,165
And for every girl he conquered.

921
00:48:04,166 --> 00:48:06,495
Need to practice,
Regain your confidence.

922
00:48:06,496 --> 00:48:07,652
Wanted ten more.

923
00:48:07,717 --> 00:48:10,334
Then maybe get another
Chloe without problems.

924
00:48:10,776 --> 00:48:12,665
Not yet.
Not yet.

925
00:48:13,330 --> 00:48:15,743
I'm going to bed with her.
I'm going to bed with her.

926
00:48:19,266 --> 00:48:20,439
So baby ...

927
00:48:20,440 --> 00:48:23,371
my life is a wet dream.
And I'm the star.

928
00:48:23,372 --> 00:48:25,343
The so Jimmy does not
differed in nothing ...

929
00:48:25,344 --> 00:48:26,285
except maybe ...

930
00:48:26,475 --> 00:48:27,791
seven centimeters.

931
00:48:33,617 --> 00:48:36,181
Wrapped in the decay
I found clarity.

932
00:48:36,959 --> 00:48:40,607
I'm not worried about the mortgage,
or have the correct clock.

933
00:48:41,235 --> 00:48:44,840
No more dreams about credit
perfect or financial freedom.

934
00:48:44,841 --> 00:48:45,906
He lived the day.

935
00:48:46,017 --> 00:48:48,238
Covering my needs
basic ...

936
00:48:48,239 --> 00:48:52,072
Food, shelter y. ..
chasing women.

937
00:48:59,578 --> 00:49:00,642
Steven.

938
00:49:01,007 --> 00:49:02,390
What's wrong?.

939
00:49:02,391 --> 00:49:04,232
You have two weeks
with the same costume.

940
00:49:04,233 --> 00:49:08,161
I've said a thousand times you clean
and you organize.

941
00:49:08,471 --> 00:49:10,441
I'm running out of patience.

942
00:49:10,956 --> 00:49:12,598
And it's not your mail

943
00:49:12,599 --> 00:49:13,914
it's pornography.

944
00:49:15,037 --> 00:49:16,077
The devil.

945
00:49:18,321 --> 00:49:20,345
What I just said?.

946
00:49:22,891 --> 00:49:23,896
The devil.

947
00:49:24,449 --> 00:49:26,056
Your insensitive ...

948
00:49:26,233 --> 00:49:28,637
Shit idiot.

949
00:49:29,116 --> 00:49:31,141
I can speak well.

950
00:49:31,142 --> 00:49:33,171
Do not you know that there resection?

951
00:49:33,172 --> 00:49:34,966
You know what does that
to jobs?.

952
00:49:34,967 --> 00:49:36,207
To hell jobs.

953
00:49:36,347 --> 00:49:38,647
To hell this job.

954
00:49:38,648 --> 00:49:40,978
Do you think you want to end up addicted
a routine like you?.

955
00:49:40,979 --> 00:49:44,962
Work, spend, acquire,
eat, get fat and die.

956
00:49:44,963 --> 00:49:46,919
Well kiss my balls.

957
00:49:47,626 --> 00:49:49,890
Get out and do not return.

958
00:49:50,237 --> 00:49:51,361
Get out of here.

959
00:49:51,362 --> 00:49:52,981
You slept with
a prostitute in Las Vegas

960
00:49:53,090 --> 00:49:54,670
- Long!
- I'll get it.

961
00:49:54,671 --> 00:49:56,702
- You are a fucking hypocrite!
- Get out of here!

962
00:49:56,703 --> 00:49:59,307
It was horrible beard!

963
00:49:59,308 --> 00:50:00,323
Call security.

964
00:50:00,324 --> 00:50:02,282
What are you laughing?,
What's so funny?

965
00:50:05,879 --> 00:50:07,396
Really beautiful.

966
00:50:09,285 --> 00:50:10,637
Impressive.

967
00:50:12,507 --> 00:50:14,007
Thanks Steven.

968
00:50:15,050 --> 00:50:16,864
Want another?.

969
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,714
What if ...
not go from here?.

970
00:50:21,343 --> 00:50:23,118
Go somewhere else ...

971
00:50:23,784 --> 00:50:25,438
... More ...

972
00:50:25,559 --> 00:50:27,717
Want to go to the room
happy?.

973
00:50:28,194 --> 00:50:30,927
No, I mean ...

974
00:50:32,083 --> 00:50:33,539
private, very private.

975
00:50:33,540 --> 00:50:36,095
As in my department.

976
00:50:38,566 --> 00:50:42,465
Private that private
costly expensive.

977
00:50:43,131 --> 00:50:44,605
Do you understand?.

978
00:50:44,745 --> 00:50:47,386
Since you spend $ 1,400.

979
00:50:47,564 --> 00:50:51,088
Well what you spend here
has nothing to do with it from there.

980
00:50:51,435 --> 00:50:54,440
And I do not accept
credit cards.

981
00:50:56,166 --> 00:50:58,391
How much do you want?.

982
00:51:00,309 --> 00:51:04,085
I might not leave
for less than $ 1.000.

983
00:51:05,363 --> 00:51:08,434
I can not get that out of cash.

984
00:51:10,756 --> 00:51:12,558
Stivie Sorry ...

985
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:15,471
Come back when you break
your pig.

986
00:51:15,472 --> 00:51:16,472
But ...

987
00:51:16,718 --> 00:51:17,983
Wait, wait ...

988
00:51:21,309 --> 00:51:23,054
I do not want to be alone.

989
00:51:24,096 --> 00:51:27,224
How about more balls?.

990
00:51:27,964 --> 00:51:29,213
No.

991
00:51:35,780 --> 00:51:37,679
I want more.

992
00:51:43,193 --> 00:51:44,274
Goodbye.

993
00:51:48,660 --> 00:51:50,965
- Are you sure you're okay?
- Yes.

994
00:51:50,966 --> 00:51:52,396
Thanks for asking.

995
00:51:52,397 --> 00:51:53,397
Yes.

996
00:51:53,778 --> 00:51:56,342
Sorry, your card
was rejected.

997
00:51:58,098 --> 00:51:59,951
Okay, I pay in cash.

998
00:52:00,465 --> 00:52:02,352
Are you kidding are $ 19?.

999
00:52:02,353 --> 00:52:05,736
Yes, use the card much,
it would delay the deposit.

1000
00:52:05,737 --> 00:52:07,468
Here you are.
Thanks.

1001
00:52:09,238 --> 00:52:11,659
Be careful in the clubs
do not out of control.

1002
00:52:11,835 --> 00:52:12,974
What will you do tomorrow?.

1003
00:52:12,975 --> 00:52:16,770
To collect rubbish obscenely
expensive wedding registry.

1004
00:52:16,771 --> 00:52:19,476
- I'll call you later, bye.
- Good bye.

1005
00:52:19,477 --> 00:52:20,477
See ya.

1006
00:52:20,830 --> 00:52:23,962
Jack was right.
Should straighten.

1007
00:52:24,930 --> 00:52:27,213
People recover all
the days of their problems.

1008
00:52:27,615 --> 00:52:29,053
How difficult can it be?.

1009
00:52:29,054 --> 00:52:31,234
Five weeks and $ 50,000 later.

1010
00:52:38,215 --> 00:52:40,054
Remove the fingers and
let me lick them.

1011
00:52:41,859 --> 00:52:44,424
Oh Stivie you are mischievous.

1012
00:52:44,425 --> 00:52:46,419
Yes, but not as much as my money.

1013
00:52:47,518 --> 00:52:48,898
We leave tonight as well.

1014
00:52:48,899 --> 00:52:50,639
- $ 1.000 each.
- Yes.

1015
00:52:50,640 --> 00:52:53,272
Tonight is your ass.

1016
00:53:00,663 --> 00:53:02,626
Who is this girl sexy?.

1017
00:53:02,627 --> 00:53:04,768
It believes its new
shit or smell.

1018
00:53:04,769 --> 00:53:06,108
Come trailer.

1019
00:53:06,109 --> 00:53:07,348
I'm not enough for you.

1020
00:53:08,727 --> 00:53:10,930
It is not enough
nor yet the place.

1021
00:53:11,519 --> 00:53:13,168
Ande go for it.

1022
00:53:16,165 --> 00:53:17,204
Thanks guys.

1023
00:53:19,316 --> 00:53:22,003
Sorry.
I called the gentleman over there.

1024
00:53:25,337 --> 00:53:27,788
Stivie she is Sage.

1025
00:53:27,789 --> 00:53:29,443
Much like Sage.

1026
00:53:30,032 --> 00:53:32,130
- I do not drink champagne.
- Tonight, yes.

1027
00:53:34,073 --> 00:53:38,328
I do not want to hear, no, I do not like
or I can not.

1028
00:53:39,266 --> 00:53:40,542
Do you understand?.

1029
00:53:44,815 --> 00:53:46,741
You make me known,
Where are you from?.

1030
00:53:46,844 --> 00:53:49,615
Kansas City.
Maybe you saw me there.

1031
00:53:50,056 --> 00:53:51,142
I think not.

1032
00:53:51,369 --> 00:53:52,605
Do I have here?.

1033
00:53:52,606 --> 00:53:53,606
Two years.

1034
00:53:53,607 --> 00:53:55,162
I am studying
in college.

1035
00:53:57,211 --> 00:53:58,669
Wait a minute. 

1036
00:53:59,449 --> 00:54:01,167
If you know.

1037
00:54:02,170 --> 00:54:05,714
Try to talk in a bar
the third.

1038
00:54:05,818 --> 00:54:06,882
The devil.

1039
00:54:07,138 --> 00:54:08,991
You were a heavy.

1040
00:54:08,992 --> 00:54:10,457
Sorry.

1041
00:54:10,458 --> 00:54:11,811
I do not remember.

1042
00:54:11,812 --> 00:54:13,354
Of course not.

1043
00:54:13,494 --> 00:54:15,381
If you behave when
pay rates.

1044
00:54:16,235 --> 00:54:19,123
- To hell do not need this.
- Wait, wait.

1045
00:54:20,669 --> 00:54:22,853
I want to take home.
Do I?

1046
00:54:23,404 --> 00:54:24,766
- What about us?
- Tomorrow.

1047
00:54:24,767 --> 00:54:25,857
Demons.

1048
00:54:25,858 --> 00:54:27,812
Who the hell
you think you are?.

1049
00:54:27,877 --> 00:54:30,307
Never would play even if you were
the last man on earth.

1050
00:54:30,709 --> 00:54:32,597
This idiot is all yours.

1051
00:54:32,856 --> 00:54:34,781
$ 5.000.

1052
00:55:11,412 --> 00:55:13,976
Wow, you're something special.

1053
00:55:14,867 --> 00:55:16,189
Well.

1054
00:55:16,556 --> 00:55:17,926
Now I want to sleep.

1055
00:55:20,133 --> 00:55:21,401
You want me to go?.

1056
00:55:21,402 --> 00:55:23,298
If you pay for that.

1057
00:55:23,587 --> 00:55:26,703
There are more than four,
"I can not stay a few hours?

1058
00:55:28,076 --> 00:55:31,175
You pay just $ 5.000.
Stay at the Ritz.

1059
00:55:32,144 --> 00:55:33,806
If you have a problem.

1060
00:55:34,471 --> 00:55:36,193
Maybe next time.

1061
00:55:36,194 --> 00:55:37,809
But you only pay two thousand.

1062
00:55:37,810 --> 00:55:39,820
Do not count on that.

1063
00:55:40,111 --> 00:55:41,457
Whatever.

1064
00:55:42,386 --> 00:55:43,999
All at a price.

1065
00:55:44,290 --> 00:55:45,948
Let me tell you something.

1066
00:55:45,949 --> 00:55:48,805
That money paid
my next semester.

1067
00:55:50,296 --> 00:55:51,921
I hope you are better
at school.

1068
00:56:14,154 --> 00:56:15,946
9.000 cost me and give me 500.

1069
00:56:15,947 --> 00:56:18,879
In this city it 500.
Take it or leave it.

1070
00:57:26,194 --> 00:57:27,613
Stev-o.

1071
00:57:28,241 --> 00:57:29,396
How have you been here?.

1072
00:57:29,611 --> 00:57:30,766
One hour.

1073
00:57:30,767 --> 00:57:32,533
Make it three and it was not pretty.

1074
00:57:33,087 --> 00:57:34,801
What the hell do all day?.

1075
00:57:34,802 --> 00:57:36,681
I did not sleep with a chick running.

1076
00:57:36,682 --> 00:57:38,535
I slept until noon
and went to the gym.

1077
00:57:38,536 --> 00:57:40,360
And then look for some friends
to do so.

1078
00:57:40,510 --> 00:57:42,165
Technically
going to enforce it.

1079
00:57:42,166 --> 00:57:43,466
- Steven worry me.
- Why?

1080
00:57:43,467 --> 00:57:44,467
I never felt better.

1081
00:57:44,501 --> 00:57:46,275
Feel, look of steel.

1082
00:57:46,276 --> 00:57:47,439
You're spending all your money ..

1083
00:57:47,440 --> 00:57:49,433
So? I'm not saving
for a beach house.

1084
00:57:49,434 --> 00:57:52,008
- I feel liberated.
- You're consuming.

1085
00:57:52,009 --> 00:57:53,736
The party ends.
There is a way of life.

1086
00:57:53,737 --> 00:57:56,496
In three months I slept
with over 15 girls over.

1087
00:57:56,497 --> 00:57:57,220
The devil.

1088
00:57:57,221 --> 00:58:00,177
All you've done in your life
is to look for sex or money.

1089
00:58:00,212 --> 00:58:01,890
Can not you see you're a disaster?

1090
00:58:01,891 --> 00:58:03,564
I mean what the hell?
look at you.

1091
00:58:03,747 --> 00:58:06,450
Renounced. Changed
why your whole life?

1092
00:58:06,514 --> 00:58:09,285
For you lost Chloe.
To hell Who is she?

1093
00:58:09,286 --> 00:58:10,412
- "Who is?
- Yes.

1094
00:58:10,628 --> 00:58:12,431
- Who the hell is?
- Yes. Who?

1095
00:58:12,432 --> 00:58:14,348
It's all
All my identity!

1096
00:58:14,349 --> 00:58:16,943
When we were Steven and Chloe
everything was perfect.

1097
00:58:16,944 --> 00:58:19,236
Now that I'm just Steven
everything sucks.

1098
00:58:19,237 --> 00:58:21,154
- How dare you ...
- Quiet, both.

1099
00:58:21,155 --> 00:58:22,694
Want to know how I felt?

1100
00:58:23,134 --> 00:58:25,229
When a girl like that
tells you he loves you ...

1101
00:58:25,230 --> 00:58:27,654
It's not like when a girl
normal tells you he loves you.

1102
00:58:28,416 --> 00:58:31,431
Accountants do not have girls like that.
Jack but I did.

1103
00:58:32,889 --> 00:58:35,416
And for some reason was
dunk on me.

1104
00:58:35,893 --> 00:58:37,373
For three years.

1105
00:58:40,106 --> 00:58:42,809
- Steven sorry.
- You're going to shut up and drink or what?

1106
00:58:44,453 --> 00:58:47,430
Alcohol need to hunt
Clancy give a double.

1107
00:58:47,431 --> 00:58:49,047
Steven calm.

1108
00:58:49,048 --> 00:58:51,775
- Rest tonight.
- No, give it to me.

1109
00:58:55,485 --> 00:58:56,530
You may calm you down.

1110
00:58:56,531 --> 00:58:58,410
Not a woman calm me down.

1111
00:58:58,550 --> 00:59:00,926
And speaking of Jack
longer one.

1112
00:59:26,502 --> 00:59:27,638
Steven.

1113
00:59:27,989 --> 00:59:30,452
- Hello.
- Amelia.

1114
00:59:33,089 --> 00:59:34,018
How are you?

1115
00:59:34,433 --> 00:59:37,519
Okay, I'm waiting for a
friend who is always late.

1116
00:59:37,657 --> 00:59:39,468
Will you come?

1117
00:59:47,012 --> 00:59:49,897
Yes, yes of course.

1118
00:59:50,376 --> 00:59:54,031
A Scottish whiskey and Chardoney
put it in my account.

1119
00:59:54,773 --> 00:59:55,985
Thanks.

1120
00:59:56,790 --> 00:59:58,926
- You look fantastic.
- Let my work.

1121
00:59:58,927 --> 01:00:00,016
And go to the gym.

1122
01:00:00,269 --> 01:00:01,804
Good for you.

1123
01:00:04,237 --> 01:00:07,043
In school I always wanted
I invite you but not the value.

1124
01:00:08,648 --> 01:00:09,858
Really?

1125
01:00:11,578 --> 01:00:13,239
I had no idea.

1126
01:00:15,033 --> 01:00:19,388
And tell me because I still
want or a thing of the past.

1127
01:00:19,613 --> 01:00:21,313
I would love to invite you.

1128
01:00:21,678 --> 01:00:23,138
How about tomorrow?

1129
01:00:24,537 --> 01:00:26,049
I can not tomorrow.

1130
01:00:26,752 --> 01:00:28,790
I leave this weekend.

1131
01:00:28,840 --> 01:00:30,747
- Next week?
- It's perfect.

1132
01:00:31,113 --> 01:00:34,262
I'm sorry,
I could not leave the office.

1133
01:00:34,263 --> 01:00:36,318
Okay. Rene on is Steven.

1134
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:38,763
- We went to school together.
- Great, great pleasure.

1135
01:00:38,892 --> 01:00:42,506
Back with my friends
pleasure.

1136
01:00:43,813 --> 01:00:45,343
I will need your number.

1137
01:00:49,916 --> 01:00:52,544
Okay I'll call you.

1138
01:00:55,313 --> 01:00:57,915
Baby look at these, are the best.

1139
01:00:58,431 --> 01:00:59,830
Like the one in the beach.

1140
01:01:00,082 --> 01:01:02,019
Is not it great
for summer cottage?

1141
01:01:02,020 --> 01:01:03,819
No love is perfect.

1142
01:01:05,587 --> 01:01:07,522
You always choose the most expensive.

1143
01:01:07,523 --> 01:01:09,063
That is usually the best.

1144
01:01:09,654 --> 01:01:12,406
I do not think it is safe for
children as close to the water.

1145
01:01:12,659 --> 01:01:14,772
We worry that
when we have them.

1146
01:01:16,377 --> 01:01:18,058
I have a surprise.

1147
01:01:19,926 --> 01:01:20,876
Do you?

1148
01:01:22,218 --> 01:01:23,768
Yes.

1149
01:01:28,492 --> 01:01:30,492
Our wedding invitation.

1150
01:01:32,024 --> 01:01:33,498
You scared me.

1151
01:01:33,499 --> 01:01:34,776
- Is not it beautiful?
- Yes.

1152
01:01:34,889 --> 01:01:37,598
In the press say
Monday will be ready.

1153
01:01:37,625 --> 01:01:38,912
- Is this Monday?
- Yes.

1154
01:01:44,575 --> 01:01:45,598
Go to sleep.

1155
01:01:47,052 --> 01:01:49,391
For some reason I could not
stop thinking about it.

1156
01:01:49,644 --> 01:01:52,263
I feel differently,
was someone real.

1157
01:01:52,477 --> 01:01:56,222
I decided to leave the party and
concentrate on her out.

1158
01:01:56,662 --> 01:01:58,368
I wanted to be respectful.

1159
01:01:58,369 --> 01:01:59,685
Could be a gentleman.

1160
01:01:59,686 --> 01:02:02,015
What orders?
is delicious.

1161
01:02:02,016 --> 01:02:05,589
Are drafts of mind,
specialty of the house.

1162
01:02:06,027 --> 01:02:07,752
I think they work.

1163
01:02:07,893 --> 01:02:09,574
I never drink so much.

1164
01:02:10,329 --> 01:02:13,259
You know? it takes courage ...

1165
01:02:13,260 --> 01:02:16,249
To leave the job well,
without alternatives.

1166
01:02:16,880 --> 01:02:18,189
I admire that.

1167
01:02:18,819 --> 01:02:20,503
And so you ...

1168
01:02:20,842 --> 01:02:22,797
all the time you need.

1169
01:02:22,798 --> 01:02:25,705
to discover
your true passion.

1170
01:02:27,403 --> 01:02:28,859
It is my plan.

1171
01:02:31,515 --> 01:02:32,564
Ask others.

1172
01:02:34,658 --> 01:02:38,780
You know? Glad
to invite me.

1173
01:02:40,211 --> 01:02:41,640
Because I feel ...

1174
01:02:41,641 --> 01:02:43,106
connected to you.

1175
01:02:48,432 --> 01:02:51,272
Tonight was fantastic.

1176
01:02:52,312 --> 01:02:53,484
Thanks.

1177
01:02:53,886 --> 01:02:55,252
Do not get out much.

1178
01:02:55,253 --> 01:02:57,658
So it was fun.

1179
01:02:58,550 --> 01:03:01,791
- And here alive.
- Go.

1180
01:03:05,054 --> 01:03:06,791
God time flew by.

1181
01:03:07,419 --> 01:03:09,533
I get up
in four hours.

1182
01:03:11,402 --> 01:03:12,953
We must do it again.

1183
01:03:13,580 --> 01:03:15,831
Yeah right.

1184
01:03:15,895 --> 01:03:17,407
Hey want to upload.

1185
01:03:18,551 --> 01:03:20,650
As I will not sleep.

1186
01:03:24,999 --> 01:03:27,013
Yeah, right.

1187
01:03:28,169 --> 01:03:29,192
Go up.

1188
01:03:40,907 --> 01:03:42,232
I like that.

1189
01:03:49,511 --> 01:03:51,821
- Steven stop.
- Sorry, sorry.

1190
01:03:51,822 --> 01:03:52,950
Go slower.

1191
01:03:54,218 --> 01:03:56,600
It may sound silly
but not me.

1192
01:03:56,601 --> 01:03:58,583
I know, I know.

1193
01:03:58,873 --> 01:04:00,150
Sorry.

1194
01:04:00,441 --> 01:04:01,522
I have to go.

1195
01:04:01,662 --> 01:04:03,249
It's late but ...

1196
01:04:03,877 --> 01:04:06,975
- I want you to call me.
- If you call.

1197
01:04:07,077 --> 01:04:08,860
- Really?
- Yeah, thanks.

1198
01:04:09,451 --> 01:04:10,643
Goodbye.

1199
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,170
I do not think I can be normal.

1200
01:04:15,291 --> 01:04:18,156
But who wants to be normal?
Is another word for weak.

1201
01:04:18,297 --> 01:04:20,937
I am a "Sexoneitor."

1202
01:04:23,003 --> 01:04:24,346
Target acquired.

1203
01:04:25,712 --> 01:04:27,971
Analysis. Ring marriage.
Abort.

1204
01:04:27,972 --> 01:04:30,097
Rating:
Grade 1 piece.

1205
01:04:34,944 --> 01:04:36,334
Factor madness
Fearless.

1206
01:04:36,334 --> 01:04:37,335
Status ...

1207
01:04:37,613 --> 01:04:39,719
Groom:
Abort!

1208
01:04:43,224 --> 01:04:46,756
Program visualization
Chest.

1209
01:04:46,757 --> 01:04:48,900
Groom:
Abort!

1210
01:04:51,716 --> 01:04:55,382
Flexibility: Yoga.
White located.

1211
01:04:57,872 --> 01:04:59,828
Looking for: Lines
conquest.

1212
01:05:01,897 --> 01:05:04,410
Are you having fun?

1213
01:05:05,177 --> 01:05:06,502
Are you having fun?

1214
01:05:07,292 --> 01:05:10,841
The advantage of being a machine
sexual managed by the devil.

1215
01:05:10,842 --> 01:05:13,697
Is that nobody will ask for explanations.

1216
01:05:13,875 --> 01:05:15,249
Amelia was a distant memory.

1217
01:05:15,435 --> 01:05:20,017
And my commitment was to lie
with beautiful young women.

1218
01:05:22,713 --> 01:05:24,395
Hears a knock at the door.

1219
01:05:25,286 --> 01:05:25,964
"Mh?

1220
01:05:26,140 --> 01:05:27,801
Someone knocks on the door.

1221
01:05:30,984 --> 01:05:33,822
- Open the door, Steven.
- Breakthrough!.

1222
01:05:35,052 --> 01:05:37,655
Stop playing and opens the door.

1223
01:05:46,517 --> 01:05:47,864
What are they doing?

1224
01:05:48,606 --> 01:05:49,902
We care about you.

1225
01:05:49,903 --> 01:05:51,933
We do not know about you in weeks.
And you have no phone.

1226
01:05:51,934 --> 01:05:53,624
Look at this place is a dump.

1227
01:06:00,265 --> 01:06:03,007
Guys she is ...

1228
01:06:03,824 --> 01:06:04,960
Erica.

1229
01:06:06,020 --> 01:06:07,541
My pleasure.

1230
01:06:07,581 --> 01:06:09,348
Thanks.

1231
01:06:09,450 --> 01:06:10,982
I was going.

1232
01:06:13,601 --> 01:06:14,756
Goodbye.

1233
01:06:22,107 --> 01:06:23,457
What the hell?

1234
01:06:23,934 --> 01:06:24,851
What?

1235
01:06:24,852 --> 01:06:27,391
How do you that?
Live in this hole.

1236
01:06:27,392 --> 01:06:29,876
You have not worked in four months.
You have no money.

1237
01:06:29,978 --> 01:06:31,825
These so close to being a bum.

1238
01:06:32,209 --> 01:06:33,336
Jack ...

1239
01:06:35,919 --> 01:06:37,595
I have sex every night.

1240
01:06:40,647 --> 01:06:43,488
Enough,
This is an intervention.

1241
01:06:43,489 --> 01:06:47,099
You understand, you need therapy
electroshock.

1242
01:06:47,100 --> 01:06:48,269
If you are an addict.

1243
01:06:48,270 --> 01:06:49,886
Steven you do with your life?

1244
01:06:50,063 --> 01:06:52,410
I think it'll take a job
gardener.

1245
01:06:52,512 --> 01:06:54,730
Working outdoors,
something physical.

1246
01:06:54,731 --> 01:06:58,014
"Physical? Go to college.
If you are an accountant.

1247
01:06:58,304 --> 01:07:00,230
Jack my rent is $ 300 a month.

1248
01:07:00,557 --> 01:07:02,882
I just need money to make
I do.

1249
01:07:02,883 --> 01:07:03,883
And then what?

1250
01:07:03,962 --> 01:07:05,964
There certainly is everything.

1251
01:07:06,911 --> 01:07:08,129
That ...

1252
01:07:08,130 --> 01:07:10,062
What are you talking about?
That sucks.

1253
01:07:10,314 --> 01:07:13,046
Jack, I earn enough to
go out every night ...

1254
01:07:13,176 --> 01:07:16,562
Go to bars all week
less champagne and achievement.

1255
01:07:16,563 --> 01:07:17,936
Is it your plan?

1256
01:07:17,937 --> 01:07:19,121
Plans To hell!

1257
01:07:19,122 --> 01:07:21,531
Heard, what is your big plan?

1258
01:07:21,559 --> 01:07:25,348
Marry a girl for money
and be at CRAWLER your father.

1259
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:26,733
To hell with you.

1260
01:07:26,734 --> 01:07:28,803
You are a hypocrite
your life sucks.

1261
01:07:30,671 --> 01:07:33,129
It is not my insane
sociopath.

1262
01:07:35,146 --> 01:07:36,227
Sure.

1263
01:07:36,365 --> 01:07:39,064
Who've been listening
all this time?

1264
01:07:39,278 --> 01:07:42,046
When the model is not my name.
Who will advise me?

1265
01:07:42,047 --> 01:07:45,455
Probably lost my phone
went to Milan or something.

1266
01:07:45,482 --> 01:07:48,352
And in that binge yours,
"Where was I?

1267
01:07:48,704 --> 01:07:52,626
Go home at night and you
masturbate thinking about my conquests.

1268
01:07:52,627 --> 01:07:54,897
Blame me if you want,
I told you just partying.

1269
01:07:54,898 --> 01:07:56,854
Not to ruin
the rest of your life.

1270
01:07:56,855 --> 01:07:58,699
You call the girl in your school.

1271
01:07:58,700 --> 01:07:59,700
Teacher.

1272
01:07:59,701 --> 01:08:00,701
I was not busy.

1273
01:08:00,702 --> 01:08:02,684
The call
What's your number?

1274
01:08:02,685 --> 01:08:04,562
- Do not want to talk.
- What are you afraid?

1275
01:08:04,563 --> 01:08:05,729
Listen to me both!

1276
01:08:07,033 --> 01:08:08,310
Sit!

1277
01:08:18,069 --> 01:08:20,302
Years ago, when I was your age
or younger ...

1278
01:08:20,303 --> 01:08:22,559
I was the head butt
just like you.

1279
01:08:22,755 --> 01:08:24,442
I did things I should not.

1280
01:08:24,443 --> 01:08:25,951
With people who do not want to know.

1281
01:08:26,128 --> 01:08:30,105
I had my dose of women.
He was proud of my manhood.

1282
01:08:30,958 --> 01:08:32,215
Yes?

1283
01:08:33,595 --> 01:08:37,975
I met a great girl,
very clever ...

1284
01:08:37,976 --> 01:08:40,606
with titles, and fell in love
like an idiot.

1285
01:08:41,140 --> 01:08:42,652
But I told myself.

1286
01:08:42,653 --> 01:08:44,799
You do not want anything with me.

1287
01:08:46,634 --> 01:08:48,099
So do not call.

1288
01:08:48,803 --> 01:08:51,762
Two years later saw
the park to another.

1289
01:08:51,763 --> 01:08:55,221
My heart broke right there.
Does God because they do not call?

1290
01:08:55,222 --> 01:08:57,123
In what was so afraid?.

1291
01:08:57,451 --> 01:08:59,207
Step one year.

1292
01:08:59,574 --> 01:09:02,009
I straighten the bar opened.

1293
01:09:02,223 --> 01:09:03,999
I became respectable.

1294
01:09:05,342 --> 01:09:08,172
And then one day ...

1295
01:09:08,800 --> 01:09:10,068
Entered the bar.

1296
01:09:10,508 --> 01:09:11,842
And I knew.

1297
01:09:12,131 --> 01:09:13,417
It had to happen.

1298
01:09:15,399 --> 01:09:17,000
Was Jennine?

1299
01:09:17,001 --> 01:09:18,001
No.

1300
01:09:18,194 --> 01:09:20,185
It was his sister Mara.

1301
01:09:20,700 --> 01:09:22,381
So I met Jennine.

1302
01:09:22,382 --> 01:09:23,792
Thanks for sharing ...

1303
01:09:24,232 --> 01:09:26,294
This great story.
But I do not see the point.

1304
01:09:26,295 --> 01:09:27,421
Call her!

1305
01:09:27,422 --> 01:09:28,521
I will not call.

1306
01:09:28,618 --> 01:09:30,905
- If the call.
- Do not want to know about me.

1307
01:09:30,906 --> 01:09:32,751
- Call her.
- I'm calling.

1308
01:09:32,752 --> 01:09:34,012
Silent.

1309
01:09:35,280 --> 01:09:36,229
Well.

1310
01:09:36,230 --> 01:09:37,190
Hello.

1311
01:09:38,054 --> 01:09:39,258
Amelia.

1312
01:09:42,557 --> 01:09:43,792
I'm Steven.

1313
01:09:46,694 --> 01:09:47,642
Well.

1314
01:09:48,159 --> 01:09:49,422
"How are you?

1315
01:09:50,389 --> 01:09:51,901
If you know.

1316
01:09:51,902 --> 01:09:53,986
I was going to call you before but ...

1317
01:09:54,539 --> 01:09:57,704
The prince and his men
followed the princess ...

1318
01:09:57,705 --> 01:09:59,476
The black forest.

1319
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:03,558
Only a prince's kiss
break the spell.

1320
01:10:03,559 --> 01:10:06,152
And the wake of
deep sleep.

1321
01:10:07,681 --> 01:10:10,246
When Prince
kiss her cheek.

1322
01:10:10,247 --> 01:10:12,506
The spell was finally broken.

1323
01:10:12,507 --> 01:10:17,244
And the Prince and Sleeping Beauty
were together at last.

1324
01:10:17,403 --> 01:10:21,247
And they lived happily ever after.

1325
01:10:27,401 --> 01:10:29,008
Prince Charming.

1326
01:10:29,299 --> 01:10:31,836
Your mama told you that came later?

1327
01:10:31,863 --> 01:10:32,837
No.

1328
01:10:32,838 --> 01:10:34,258
I'll call.

1329
01:10:34,550 --> 01:10:37,918
Well, stay with my friend Steven
a moment ok?

1330
01:10:37,919 --> 01:10:38,919
Yes.

1331
01:10:42,529 --> 01:10:44,326
- What is your name?
- Dereck.

1332
01:10:44,879 --> 01:10:47,188
You did very well, Dereck.

1333
01:10:47,290 --> 01:10:48,275
If, as is.

1334
01:10:48,276 --> 01:10:50,906
My damn friends
going to bother me.

1335
01:10:50,907 --> 01:10:52,788
I had to kiss the skinny bitch.

1336
01:10:54,355 --> 01:10:56,705
- You should not talk like that.
- Why the hell not?

1337
01:10:58,569 --> 01:11:00,186
Because it is not good for you.

1338
01:11:00,251 --> 01:11:01,650
If, however.

1339
01:11:01,651 --> 01:11:02,666
Do you like the teacher eh?

1340
01:11:02,667 --> 01:11:04,800
If I like it.

1341
01:11:04,828 --> 01:11:06,141
You too like?

1342
01:11:06,349 --> 01:11:08,042
But I will not be
that ass.

1343
01:11:08,043 --> 01:11:10,036
How old are you?
You know what that means?

1344
01:11:10,037 --> 01:11:11,653
I have eight and a half, damn.

1345
01:11:11,654 --> 01:11:13,383
What the hell did you think?

1346
01:11:14,010 --> 01:11:17,510
Well, talk to your brother
arrived half an hour.

1347
01:11:25,543 --> 01:11:27,616
Thanks for putting up with everything.

1348
01:11:27,617 --> 01:11:30,347
- Forget that the work was today.
- Do not worry.

1349
01:11:30,348 --> 01:11:31,513
I had fun.

1350
01:11:32,104 --> 01:11:34,688
It is seen that children adore.
You're great with them.

1351
01:11:34,689 --> 01:11:36,343
I love working with children.

1352
01:11:36,707 --> 01:11:38,557
I think I make a difference.

1353
01:11:39,899 --> 01:11:41,338
What about you?

1354
01:11:42,003 --> 01:11:43,403
Want to have children one day '

1355
01:11:44,652 --> 01:11:46,352
When you are ready.

1356
01:11:46,868 --> 01:11:50,457
When you find with whom
spend the rest of my life.

1357
01:11:54,992 --> 01:11:57,107
I did not know whether to call you.

1358
01:11:58,713 --> 01:12:00,885
After what happened that night.

1359
01:12:01,813 --> 01:12:02,911
But ...

1360
01:12:03,952 --> 01:12:05,861
I'm glad I echo.

1361
01:12:09,760 --> 01:12:11,027
I've been ...

1362
01:12:11,356 --> 01:12:13,456
avoiding people lately.

1363
01:12:14,273 --> 01:12:17,118
As if my mind wanted to escape.

1364
01:12:17,972 --> 01:12:20,181
It's scary to be alone in the world.

1365
01:12:20,697 --> 01:12:21,984
Yes.

1366
01:12:23,215 --> 01:12:25,592
I escape from the problem.

1367
01:12:27,423 --> 01:12:29,462
But I get tired.

1368
01:12:31,482 --> 01:12:33,579
There have to be alone Steven.

1369
01:12:36,047 --> 01:12:37,953
I do not want to be alone.

1370
01:13:02,475 --> 01:13:04,389
Hey, Jack.

1371
01:13:04,604 --> 01:13:06,473
We get up late.

1372
01:13:06,474 --> 01:13:10,572
I see your dad all week
would not see it on Saturday.

1373
01:13:10,573 --> 01:13:12,755
I promised him
have lunch with him.

1374
01:13:12,756 --> 01:13:15,049
Please be respectful of my family.

1375
01:13:15,226 --> 01:13:18,427
You know my father
likes to be disappointed.

1376
01:13:18,616 --> 01:13:20,177
So let's go.

1377
01:13:20,278 --> 01:13:21,684
I can not.

1378
01:13:22,800 --> 01:13:25,177
Bad luck is waiting for us.

1379
01:13:25,178 --> 01:13:27,152
I do not mean it is ...

1380
01:13:28,008 --> 01:13:31,405
Steven and advise
I became a monster.

1381
01:13:31,406 --> 01:13:34,563
Now I can not see me
without seeing a monster too.

1382
01:13:37,785 --> 01:13:39,525
What is that supposed to mean?

1383
01:13:42,408 --> 01:13:44,089
I'm obsessed with money.

1384
01:13:44,943 --> 01:13:48,146
I'm sick, you're my
response and makes me sick.

1385
01:13:54,150 --> 01:13:55,610
Jack.

1386
01:14:06,536 --> 01:14:08,010
I love you.

1387
01:14:09,202 --> 01:14:11,973
We need to know that
a wonderful life.

1388
01:14:12,601 --> 01:14:14,413
Be careful.

1389
01:14:15,907 --> 01:14:18,370
Being careful makes me miserable.

1390
01:14:23,702 --> 01:14:25,668
Steven rests.

1391
01:14:34,132 --> 01:14:35,038
What about your girlfriend?

1392
01:14:35,936 --> 01:14:37,076
Okay.

1393
01:14:37,413 --> 01:14:38,509
Okay.

1394
01:14:39,739 --> 01:14:42,051
- Hey, how your truck?
There he is.

1395
01:14:48,241 --> 01:14:49,718
Hi In what I can do for you?

1396
01:14:49,719 --> 01:14:51,899
Reservation on behalf of Goodson.

1397
01:14:52,243 --> 01:14:53,182
Okay.

1398
01:14:54,339 --> 01:14:56,765
I see nothing here.

1399
01:14:56,766 --> 01:14:58,985
If here it is.

1400
01:14:59,164 --> 01:15:00,487
Here.

1401
01:15:06,492 --> 01:15:08,156
Happy Valentine's Day.

1402
01:15:08,296 --> 01:15:09,507
Thanks.

1403
01:15:12,353 --> 01:15:14,204
They are beautiful.

1404
01:15:16,373 --> 01:15:17,697
I love them.

1405
01:15:17,698 --> 01:15:20,647
I have something for you.

1406
01:15:28,681 --> 01:15:30,513
This is not what I expected.

1407
01:15:30,766 --> 01:15:32,052
I did it myself.

1408
01:15:32,456 --> 01:15:34,758
It's our first picture together.

1409
01:15:34,759 --> 01:15:37,728
And the rest is to fill
in the future.

1410
01:15:40,688 --> 01:15:42,106
It's great.

1411
01:15:43,753 --> 01:15:46,008
And I have another surprise for you.

1412
01:15:49,041 --> 01:15:51,550
You've been so patient ...

1413
01:15:52,441 --> 01:15:54,104
So wonderful ...

1414
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:57,675
I'm ready.

1415
01:16:01,347 --> 01:16:03,861
You can say something
As ...

1416
01:16:03,862 --> 01:16:05,179
they're happy.

1417
01:16:05,180 --> 01:16:06,308
I'm happy.

1418
01:16:07,178 --> 01:16:08,727
Of course I'm happy.

1419
01:16:09,392 --> 01:16:11,527
I already feel comfortable with you.

1420
01:16:14,146 --> 01:16:15,508
Are you okay?

1421
01:16:21,285 --> 01:16:22,289
I'm fine.

1422
01:16:22,290 --> 01:16:24,512
You have a very strange look.

1423
01:16:24,730 --> 01:16:25,941
What are you thinking?

1424
01:16:29,579 --> 01:16:31,506
Are you listening? Steven.

1425
01:16:33,118 --> 01:16:34,714
Now return.

1426
01:16:44,140 --> 01:16:45,200
Sorry.

1427
01:16:46,843 --> 01:16:48,377
We already know.

1428
01:16:48,590 --> 01:16:50,515
In my department,
Internet did you?

1429
01:16:50,636 --> 01:16:51,668
Yes.

1430
01:16:52,798 --> 01:16:54,409
I have $ 200.

1431
01:16:54,797 --> 01:16:56,068
I need you right now.

1432
01:16:56,382 --> 01:16:58,007
I'm $ 400 an hour.

1433
01:16:58,008 --> 01:17:00,124
And the guy who I am
Payment overnight.

1434
01:17:00,125 --> 01:17:01,366
I have only 200.

1435
01:17:01,584 --> 01:17:03,276
But these are only five minutes.

1436
01:17:04,054 --> 01:17:06,187
Only this need,
We, here in the bathroom.

1437
01:17:08,619 --> 01:17:10,790
- Five minutes to finish or not.

1438
01:17:10,791 --> 01:17:11,791
Okay.

1439
01:18:16,101 --> 01:18:19,088
Sure you're right,
takes too long.

1440
01:18:20,393 --> 01:18:21,943
Yes, I'm fine.

1441
01:18:22,347 --> 01:18:23,678
Is your stomach?

1442
01:18:24,269 --> 01:18:25,542
No.

1443
01:18:26,208 --> 01:18:27,608
Do not worry.

1444
01:18:27,710 --> 01:18:30,312
Then we go from here.

1445
01:18:30,734 --> 01:18:32,921
Vamonos y. ..
let us see.

1446
01:18:35,316 --> 01:18:37,337
Wait a second.

1447
01:18:45,839 --> 01:18:46,906
I have to ...

1448
01:18:51,331 --> 01:18:53,521
- I have to tell you something.
- What?

1449
01:18:58,375 --> 01:18:59,984
Do not know where to start.

1450
01:19:01,233 --> 01:19:03,780
Whatever you tell me.

1451
01:19:09,558 --> 01:19:11,318
I have a problem.

1452
01:19:12,023 --> 01:19:15,382
These scaring me, Steven.

1453
01:19:23,716 --> 01:19:25,854
Well, can not be that bad.

1454
01:19:29,150 --> 01:19:30,628
The only thing I think.

1455
01:19:31,219 --> 01:19:33,268
It is in bed with women.

1456
01:19:33,482 --> 01:19:34,956
Even when I'm with you.

1457
01:19:35,175 --> 01:19:36,123
What?

1458
01:19:36,132 --> 01:19:37,357
What are you saying?

1459
01:19:37,457 --> 01:19:39,525
I have sex with at least
five women a week.

1460
01:19:40,305 --> 01:19:41,366
It's crazy.

1461
01:19:41,630 --> 01:19:45,312
What?, Need help
you should talk to someone.

1462
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:46,630
Do not understand.

1463
01:19:48,724 --> 01:19:50,837
I just do it
a prostitute in the bathroom.

1464
01:19:51,391 --> 01:19:53,718
- For $ 200.
- What?

1465
01:19:56,094 --> 01:19:57,607
Here.

1466
01:19:58,836 --> 01:20:00,592
Right here tonight?

1467
01:20:01,709 --> 01:20:03,171
Sorry.

1468
01:20:27,776 --> 01:20:29,739
I can not be with you.

1469
01:20:50,337 --> 01:20:53,372
You know you have to take?
It is part of the job.

1470
01:20:55,064 --> 01:20:56,087
Give them.

1471
01:21:01,940 --> 01:21:04,024
With this ring I thee wed.

1472
01:21:05,819 --> 01:21:07,558
With this ring you are dead.

1473
01:21:07,559 --> 01:21:09,851
With this ring I become
very rich.

1474
01:21:09,954 --> 01:21:12,595
- So shut up and be happy for me.
- Why?

1475
01:21:12,908 --> 01:21:14,417
Being happy is not part of the plan.

1476
01:21:14,418 --> 01:21:17,247
- At least sought.
- I'm not as good as you.

1477
01:21:17,421 --> 01:21:18,739
You're a hopeless case.

1478
01:21:18,740 --> 01:21:22,549
I must be sad that
I'm selling.

1479
01:21:23,103 --> 01:21:25,254
Hey, I'm sold.

1480
01:21:28,552 --> 01:21:29,652
I admitted.

1481
01:21:29,653 --> 01:21:31,430
In the house of god
I admitted.

1482
01:21:31,431 --> 01:21:32,431
And it gave me a ray ...

1483
01:21:32,432 --> 01:21:34,778
I am not cursed.
Because nobody cares.

1484
01:21:34,779 --> 01:21:37,482
Not support it,
I do not want to do with it.

1485
01:21:37,483 --> 01:21:39,953
The sound of your voice makes
that I shrink the balls.

1486
01:21:39,954 --> 01:21:43,860
Not to mention the joy of his father
treating me like a loser.

1487
01:21:43,861 --> 01:21:46,850
And the most neurotic mother
lunatic all.

1488
01:21:47,825 --> 01:21:50,182
Jack, let's begin.
Hurry.

1489
01:21:51,081 --> 01:21:52,801
Yes, thanks, I'm in a second.

1490
01:22:08,501 --> 01:22:10,389
To hell with you and
your stupid advice.

1491
01:22:10,509 --> 01:22:12,596
And to hell with me
for listening.

1492
01:22:12,699 --> 01:22:15,188
Do you know how I became?
I get sick myself.

1493
01:22:15,554 --> 01:22:18,748
Amelia was the best I could
pass and could not help ruin.

1494
01:22:19,566 --> 01:22:22,002
Y. .. and this thing is ...

1495
01:22:22,003 --> 01:22:24,148
eating me.
Not stand it anymore.

1496
01:22:24,180 --> 01:22:25,731
I will change!

1497
01:22:25,732 --> 01:22:27,257
Well, because I go to Tahiti ...

1498
01:22:27,258 --> 01:22:31,355
on a yacht of $ 9.000 per week
to start my life from crazy rich.

1499
01:22:32,077 --> 01:22:33,380
To hell Jack.

1500
01:22:34,271 --> 01:22:35,884
To hell with you.

1501
01:22:36,740 --> 01:22:40,670
To hell with them.
Jack everyone is ready. Now!

1502
01:23:14,239 --> 01:23:16,637
The thing inside of me
not just me.

1503
01:23:17,209 --> 01:23:19,927
Attacked me stronger but
I could stop it.

1504
01:23:20,967 --> 01:23:23,282
I was trying to rehab
human again.

1505
01:23:24,212 --> 01:23:26,007
I wanted my soul back.

1506
01:23:27,950 --> 01:23:30,721
Deserve to be wanted
someone real.

1507
01:23:31,010 --> 01:23:34,834
Free fantasies
advertising.

1508
01:23:36,138 --> 01:23:39,718
With luck you might see the beauty
with eyes closed.

1509
01:23:40,307 --> 01:23:42,683
Feeling in my heart.

1510
01:23:42,992 --> 01:23:45,088
... Took me at least
30 cups of coffee daily.

1511
01:23:48,011 --> 01:23:50,613
I was fired and I did not care.

1512
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:53,619
It was an animal.

1513
01:23:57,558 --> 01:23:58,969
A machine.

1514
01:24:01,977 --> 01:24:03,026
But ...

1515
01:24:05,535 --> 01:24:07,310
I'm ready to ...

1516
01:24:07,975 --> 01:24:10,352
Take the first steps toward ...

1517
01:24:11,808 --> 01:24:13,733
Sexual sobriety.

1518
01:24:24,359 --> 01:24:26,234
The thing in me still lives.

1519
01:24:26,449 --> 01:24:27,924
It is an echo.

1520
01:24:28,751 --> 01:24:31,133
But now I feel I can
fight.

1521
01:24:31,650 --> 01:24:33,863
day.

1522
01:24:42,761 --> 01:24:44,104
I know.

1523
01:24:44,105 --> 01:24:46,097
Do not want to know
anything about me.

1524
01:24:47,627 --> 01:24:49,480
But we must be together.

1525
01:24:52,267 --> 01:24:54,203
I ask you another chance.

1526
01:24:55,713 --> 01:24:59,050
There is a reason for not
answer any of your calls.

1527
01:24:59,602 --> 01:25:01,510
I know, what I did is horrible.

1528
01:25:02,362 --> 01:25:04,175
I do not think you understand.

1529
01:25:04,176 --> 01:25:05,361
Not true.

1530
01:25:11,137 --> 01:25:13,738
I feel I broke something
you can not paste.

1531
01:25:14,968 --> 01:25:16,988
Hurting as I did.

1532
01:25:19,383 --> 01:25:21,721
I guess that's the price
you have to pay.

1533
01:25:28,402 --> 01:25:29,820
Just go.

1534
01:25:33,643 --> 01:25:35,004
Amelia please ...

1535
01:25:35,257 --> 01:25:37,182
Steven Get out!
No kidding.

1536
01:25:47,470 --> 01:25:49,290
Do not blame her for not wanting
be with me

1537
01:25:49,291 --> 01:25:51,413
after profane
human integrity.

1538
01:25:51,414 --> 01:25:52,692
"Defiled her that that?

1539
01:25:53,171 --> 01:25:55,209
I have no idea that
're saying.

1540
01:25:55,386 --> 01:25:57,575
But it sounds like you were wrong
much with the teacher.

1541
01:25:57,678 --> 01:25:58,913
You're right I did.

1542
01:25:59,164 --> 01:26:02,611
After thinking back
something to keep that body.

1543
01:26:02,612 --> 01:26:04,362
Not all about bodies.

1544
01:26:04,363 --> 01:26:06,402
It is always about bodies.

1545
01:26:07,331 --> 01:26:09,745
A few months ago would agree.

1546
01:26:09,746 --> 01:26:11,061
But trust me ...

1547
01:26:11,062 --> 01:26:12,697
Nothing is further from the truth.

1548
01:26:12,910 --> 01:26:15,783
The teacher always says,
if someone says sorry.

1549
01:26:15,848 --> 01:26:18,790
Accept his apology
and give him another chance.

1550
01:26:19,269 --> 01:26:21,579
I never really sorry.

1551
01:26:21,580 --> 01:26:23,575
You never said "sorry"!.

1552
01:26:23,716 --> 01:26:25,816
What way is that to recover?

1553
01:26:25,817 --> 01:26:27,622
Go back there and say you're sorry.

1554
01:26:27,799 --> 01:26:29,029
And after that.

1555
01:26:29,030 --> 01:26:32,112
Reza, to return
to trust, fuck.

1556
01:26:32,214 --> 01:26:34,817
You have eight and a half years
you should not talk like that.

1557
01:26:35,069 --> 01:26:37,395
It's what brought you
to the principal's office.

1558
01:26:37,760 --> 01:26:39,706
I have nine now, bitch.

1559
01:26:48,174 --> 01:26:50,240
Just wanted to say "Sorry."

1560
01:26:50,477 --> 01:26:51,450
What?

1561
01:26:55,236 --> 01:26:57,592
I never said the words
"Sorry."

1562
01:27:00,288 --> 01:27:02,932
Okay, you did.

1563
01:27:04,030 --> 01:27:05,399
Now go.

1564
01:27:05,400 --> 01:27:07,197
Derek told me
if he said sorry.

1565
01:27:07,198 --> 01:27:10,225
Please accept my apology
and give me another chance.

1566
01:27:11,530 --> 01:27:14,300
Those are your rules.

1567
01:27:14,301 --> 01:27:17,049
Now you take advice from a child
eight years.

1568
01:27:17,050 --> 01:27:19,487
What happens most
leisure punished.

1569
01:27:19,488 --> 01:27:21,595
Why can not hold
to curse.

1570
01:27:23,729 --> 01:27:26,116
Perhaps with a little help
make it.

1571
01:27:26,752 --> 01:27:28,715
And it has nine.

1572
01:27:28,716 --> 01:27:30,184
Is a child.

1573
01:27:30,909 --> 01:27:32,714
From a broken home.

1574
01:27:32,715 --> 01:27:34,989
Angry
screaming for attention.

1575
01:27:35,786 --> 01:27:37,268
You are an adult.

1576
01:27:37,269 --> 01:27:39,533
Who were you really
worried about you.

1577
01:27:40,316 --> 01:27:43,698
And you just could not keep
in your pants.

1578
01:27:45,643 --> 01:27:47,607
Are very different.

1579
01:27:47,767 --> 01:27:50,257
Do not forget to ask
everything that happened.

1580
01:27:50,960 --> 01:27:52,595
Only I beg you to trust me.

1581
01:27:52,596 --> 01:27:54,465
To open your door a little.

1582
01:27:55,094 --> 01:27:57,864
And not only you me too serious
I trust me.

1583
01:27:57,865 --> 01:28:00,269
Cause I'd rather die
to hurt again.

1584
01:28:02,251 --> 01:28:04,672
I can not live
in a world where ...

1585
01:28:04,735 --> 01:28:07,074
There is not hope,
a future for us.

1586
01:28:07,156 --> 01:28:08,768
Why should there be?

1587
01:28:09,133 --> 01:28:11,473
Because who I am
when I'm with you.

1588
01:28:13,040 --> 01:28:15,232
And that's the person I want to be.

1589
01:28:16,200 --> 01:28:19,692
Be who you are when you're with me.
And it is to want to be.

1590
01:28:22,425 --> 01:28:24,766
Do you really think you know all this?

1591
01:28:26,859 --> 01:28:29,123
That's all for sure.

1592
01:28:40,168 --> 01:28:41,699
You know what is best ...

1593
01:28:41,801 --> 01:28:44,611
to see the world as
a child of nine years.

1594
01:28:47,081 --> 01:28:49,289
Everything seems possible.

1595
01:28:50,874 --> 01:28:53,853
Happy endings are
just around the corner.

1596
01:28:57,978 --> 01:29:00,429
Too bad we have to grow.

1597
01:29:00,795 --> 01:29:05,117
When you're a kid you must be late
perfect, where everything is easy.

1598
01:29:05,464 --> 01:29:08,030
Also adult
you can have it.

1599
01:29:08,031 --> 01:29:10,179
Just to be a version where ...

1600
01:29:10,507 --> 01:29:12,668
There is pain and nothing is easy.

1601
01:29:15,251 --> 01:29:18,644
And you must be willing and ready
to earn it.

1602
01:29:33,258 --> 01:29:34,468
Sit.

1603
01:29:38,556 --> 01:29:39,998
I have ...

1604
01:29:40,311 --> 01:29:42,238
I have to grade homework.
