1
00:00:28,763 --> 00:00:32,266
<i>I bet you're wondering who I am,</i>

2
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:34,167
<i>what I look like.</i>

3
00:00:34,201 --> 00:00:36,504
<i>Maybe someone
you've seen in a magazine,</i>

4
00:00:36,538 --> 00:00:38,272
<i>CNN, you know,</i>

5
00:00:38,305 --> 00:00:41,475
<i>a nobody with a story to tell.</i>

6
00:00:41,509 --> 00:00:44,546
<i>Popular, notorious
or insignificant.</i>

7
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:46,146
<i>The fact I have my hands bound,</i>

8
00:00:46,179 --> 00:00:49,116
<i>face covered, stuck alone here</i>

9
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,853
<i>means I have a story to tell.</i>

10
00:00:51,886 --> 00:00:53,721
<i>I was donating money to charity,</i>

11
00:00:53,755 --> 00:00:58,225
<i>when I felt a prick in my neck.
Next thing I know,</i>

12
00:00:58,258 --> 00:01:00,060
<i>I'm tied up here,
surrounded by...</i>

13
00:01:00,762 --> 00:01:04,364
<i>three idiots.</i>

14
00:01:04,398 --> 00:01:07,735
<i>I needed my medication,
and when I didn't get it...</i>

15
00:01:10,572 --> 00:01:12,172
<i>my body reacted.</i>

16
00:01:14,341 --> 00:01:16,276
Just break
the fucking lightbulb, okay?

17
00:01:16,310 --> 00:01:17,645
I'll do angel dust for it.

18
00:01:19,279 --> 00:01:21,181
<i>Don't judge me.</i>

19
00:01:21,214 --> 00:01:22,817
<i>Which brings me back to now.</i>

20
00:01:24,418 --> 00:01:25,653
<i>I can't tell day...</i>

21
00:01:27,220 --> 00:01:28,288
<i>or night.</i>

22
00:01:29,757 --> 00:01:31,593
<i>I was bored and these idiots</i>

23
00:01:31,626 --> 00:01:33,460
<i>didn't know a thing
about violence, so...</i>

24
00:01:34,862 --> 00:01:38,498
<i>I made their lives
a living hell.</i>

25
00:01:38,533 --> 00:01:40,434
<i>I might have overdone it.</i>

26
00:01:40,467 --> 00:01:43,337
<i>No matter what happens,
I will survive this.</i>

27
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:46,608
<i>The hood on means they are
protecting their identity.</i>

28
00:01:46,641 --> 00:01:49,209
<i>They are protecting their plan.</i>

29
00:01:49,242 --> 00:01:51,211
<i>They are protecting their lives.</i>

30
00:01:53,548 --> 00:01:54,849
<i>They don't want me dead.</i>

31
00:01:56,551 --> 00:01:57,819
Guys, I didn't see anything.

32
00:01:59,854 --> 00:02:01,154
Look at me.

33
00:02:02,657 --> 00:02:04,659
Look at me.

34
00:02:06,961 --> 00:02:08,228
Say my name.

35
00:02:16,436 --> 00:02:20,474
I'm sorry.
I haven't been myself, okay?

36
00:02:20,508 --> 00:02:22,175
I didn't mean what I said.

37
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:24,411
It's this place.
It's this house, okay?

38
00:02:24,444 --> 00:02:25,747
It's eating into my head.

39
00:02:25,780 --> 00:02:27,381
You're blaming the house now?

40
00:02:30,317 --> 00:02:32,553
It's just... Your friends...

41
00:02:33,054 --> 00:02:36,356
They were taking care of me,

42
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:39,226
vomit and all,
and I got spoiled.

43
00:02:40,995 --> 00:02:43,263
Pissed that you weren't
doing the same.

44
00:02:44,532 --> 00:02:46,366
I'm giving you Isabella Contini.

45
00:02:47,802 --> 00:02:48,870
I'm a good person.

46
00:02:50,303 --> 00:02:53,675
I have no excuse
to have disrespected you.

47
00:02:54,676 --> 00:02:56,243
But you did.

48
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:58,278
And now you see my face.

49
00:02:58,311 --> 00:02:59,681
You will die.

50
00:03:02,884 --> 00:03:04,451
I am a movie star.

51
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:06,754
I can make
your dreams come true.

52
00:03:07,254 --> 00:03:09,389
You were a movie star.

53
00:03:12,459 --> 00:03:15,495
Me dead is not going
to help anyone.

54
00:03:16,998 --> 00:03:19,667
My fans need me.
I save lives.

55
00:03:22,837 --> 00:03:24,605
Don't tell me
you believe that shit.

56
00:03:27,474 --> 00:03:28,810
Please don't kill me.

57
00:03:28,843 --> 00:03:32,513
It's been 13 motherfucking days.

58
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:34,347
13 days?

59
00:03:35,482 --> 00:03:37,185
Done talking, your Majesty.

60
00:03:37,752 --> 00:03:39,954
The wallet
hungers for the bounty.

61
00:03:40,888 --> 00:03:42,523
Fuck!

62
00:03:43,490 --> 00:03:45,526
It was supposed to be
a two day job.

63
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:48,029
We sent the ransom note,
her mother wires us the money.

64
00:03:48,062 --> 00:03:49,731
It's been 13 days.

65
00:03:53,835 --> 00:03:55,670
It's just 13 days.

66
00:03:56,470 --> 00:03:58,706
13 fucking days.

67
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:00,708
We asked the mother
not to tell the cops.

68
00:04:00,742 --> 00:04:02,977
The woman has been
seen on every TV station

69
00:04:03,010 --> 00:04:04,444
that would have her.

70
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:05,847
- Step backs...
- With what?

71
00:04:05,880 --> 00:04:06,948
It's over, Diamond.

72
00:04:06,981 --> 00:04:09,050
Stay calm.

73
00:04:09,083 --> 00:04:11,052
Be calm.

74
00:04:11,085 --> 00:04:13,054
If we get the money, the cops
are going to be on the bills

75
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:14,722
like flies on shit.

76
00:04:14,756 --> 00:04:15,857
All she got to do
is point to the deal

77
00:04:15,890 --> 00:04:16,958
and we are made.

78
00:04:16,991 --> 00:04:18,693
We are not murderers.

79
00:04:18,726 --> 00:04:20,260
Four weeks ago,
we weren't kidnappers either.

80
00:04:20,828 --> 00:04:22,462
We are looking at 20 to life

81
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:23,598
the minute she walks
through that door.

82
00:04:24,397 --> 00:04:25,600
You wanted this.

83
00:04:25,633 --> 00:04:27,400
You wanted this shit.

84
00:04:27,702 --> 00:04:29,670
This is about Aiko.

85
00:04:29,704 --> 00:04:31,404
I should have known that.

86
00:04:32,039 --> 00:04:34,441
You just signed
your divorce papers.

87
00:04:34,474 --> 00:04:37,410
Signed my divorce papers?
How do you know that?

88
00:04:37,444 --> 00:04:39,046
- Platinum.
- How does he know that?

89
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,983
- You didn't tell him?
- I didn't tell anyone.

90
00:04:42,349 --> 00:04:44,652
Anyways, I don't care,
it doesn't brother me.

91
00:04:45,686 --> 00:04:48,723
It was 12 years of your life.

92
00:04:49,624 --> 00:04:52,593
It takes more than
a signature to sign that away.

93
00:04:54,695 --> 00:04:56,363
So, what are we going to do now?

94
00:05:06,040 --> 00:05:07,842
You want to kill me?

95
00:05:07,875 --> 00:05:10,477
We don't have a choice.
We don't have a damn choice.

96
00:05:10,511 --> 00:05:12,780
- You always have a choice.
- You know what we look like.

97
00:05:12,814 --> 00:05:14,715
'Cause you took the hood off.

98
00:05:14,749 --> 00:05:16,483
You shouldn't have
called me a nigger.

99
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,586
I would never say that.

100
00:05:18,619 --> 00:05:21,421
- Did you just call me a liar?
- No. No.

101
00:05:21,454 --> 00:05:22,757
So, you said it.

102
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,559
Let our
blood temperatures chill.

103
00:05:24,592 --> 00:05:26,060
We are chill.

104
00:05:26,093 --> 00:05:28,763
No, my friend, our rage
has overtaken our logic.

105
00:05:28,796 --> 00:05:30,463
I'll say it.

106
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:32,133
Do you want me
to say I said the N word?

107
00:05:32,166 --> 00:05:33,501
- I'm sorry.
- Emotional aura

108
00:05:33,534 --> 00:05:34,836
clouds the gravity of words.

109
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:36,504
Really, Platinum.
Gravity of word?

110
00:05:36,537 --> 00:05:37,872
We should row on calmer waters.

111
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:39,607
Everything is dandy
on these waters.

112
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:41,042
Perspective overshadow ire.

113
00:05:41,075 --> 00:05:42,677
She is our ticket
out of the weight

114
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,911
of unpaid responsibilities.

115
00:05:43,945 --> 00:05:45,646
If she meets a sudden demise,

116
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,915
the months of planning
are all for naught.

117
00:05:47,949 --> 00:05:49,449
What the fuck are you saying?

118
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:50,685
Hey.

119
00:05:51,752 --> 00:05:52,820
It's me.

120
00:05:55,656 --> 00:05:56,724
I said the word.

121
00:05:57,625 --> 00:05:58,793
I'm the one that's going.

122
00:06:03,898 --> 00:06:05,766
Typical damsel in distress.

123
00:06:05,800 --> 00:06:07,400
Honestly, I'm not sure why.

124
00:06:07,434 --> 00:06:10,004
Deep down,
every guy wants to rescue

125
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,706
every girl he wants to fuck.

126
00:06:13,007 --> 00:06:16,744
The parasite
is probably a barista

127
00:06:17,278 --> 00:06:18,779
who has a script to share.

128
00:06:20,748 --> 00:06:21,816
Pathetic.

129
00:06:23,784 --> 00:06:25,853
Aw, token black guy.

130
00:06:27,555 --> 00:06:30,858
I underestimated
how emotionally fragile he was.

131
00:06:31,859 --> 00:06:33,594
Quick to pull the race card.

132
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:37,064
Wannabe gangster.

133
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:40,701
Out of this whole...

134
00:06:41,802 --> 00:06:43,137
disorganized crew...

135
00:06:46,107 --> 00:06:48,042
the only one
that doesn't want to fuck me.

136
00:06:56,183 --> 00:06:57,618
I know what you're thinking.

137
00:06:58,653 --> 00:07:00,021
Let me ask you.

138
00:07:00,054 --> 00:07:01,989
Not the person
beside you, but you.

139
00:07:02,023 --> 00:07:04,625
How many women
do you know that look like me,

140
00:07:04,659 --> 00:07:05,860
who marry men like that?

141
00:07:05,893 --> 00:07:07,595
Richer, more famous, successful,

142
00:07:07,628 --> 00:07:08,996
or have a brilliant career, huh?

143
00:07:11,265 --> 00:07:12,533
Let me guess.

144
00:07:13,267 --> 00:07:15,069
None.

145
00:07:15,102 --> 00:07:17,571
And that, my dear friends,
is why men like these

146
00:07:18,205 --> 00:07:21,008
want to fuck a woman like me.

147
00:07:24,245 --> 00:07:25,513
Anyway...

148
00:07:26,380 --> 00:07:29,817
say your prayers
and tighten your shoelaces.

149
00:07:29,850 --> 00:07:31,919
It's going to be a long day.

150
00:07:31,953 --> 00:07:33,654
We have no choice in the matter.

151
00:07:34,855 --> 00:07:36,891
Isabella must die.

152
00:07:36,924 --> 00:07:39,160
Let quiet minds focus
on the bounty we can gain.

153
00:07:39,193 --> 00:07:41,128
Let quiet minds focus on what?

154
00:07:41,162 --> 00:07:42,930
The word nigger
means nothing to you?

155
00:07:42,964 --> 00:07:45,266
The N words power
is dependent upon the beholder.

156
00:07:45,299 --> 00:07:47,068
You selfish prick.

157
00:07:47,101 --> 00:07:48,602
The only thing you give
a damn about is yourself.

158
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:51,238
Art thou attempting
to enrage me?

159
00:07:51,272 --> 00:07:53,507
You need sharper words.

160
00:07:54,208 --> 00:07:56,610
Then again, the only word

161
00:07:56,644 --> 00:07:58,646
that matters
to the people of worth,

162
00:07:58,946 --> 00:08:01,082
and you are worth nothing.

163
00:08:04,218 --> 00:08:05,753
What did you call me?

164
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:07,855
It starts with an "N"

165
00:08:07,888 --> 00:08:09,123
and rhymes with rotten.

166
00:08:09,590 --> 00:08:12,793
Nothing.
I called you a nothing.

167
00:08:12,827 --> 00:08:15,730
Fuck you!
You livid in son of whore.

168
00:08:15,763 --> 00:08:17,231
Shut up, Nitro.
Don't make this...

169
00:08:17,264 --> 00:08:18,833
Time travel
from this Shakespearean era.

170
00:08:18,866 --> 00:08:20,568
You are nothing.
You were born nothing.

171
00:08:20,601 --> 00:08:22,203
You will die nothing.

172
00:08:22,236 --> 00:08:24,205
I'm not the one trying
to get a washed up actress

173
00:08:24,238 --> 00:08:25,606
to help me sell my book.

174
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:27,108
Walk away.
Just walk away.

175
00:08:27,141 --> 00:08:30,111
Walk away from a fight?
No, no, no, no, no, no.

176
00:08:30,144 --> 00:08:32,780
It's not my style.
Let's even things out.

177
00:08:33,514 --> 00:08:35,049
Platinum, why don't you
pull out your gun?

178
00:08:35,082 --> 00:08:36,951
Shut up, Nitro.

179
00:08:36,984 --> 00:08:39,787
Go on, then.
Take it out, pull the trigger.

180
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:41,722
You know you want to.

181
00:08:41,756 --> 00:08:43,290
Shut up, Nitro, this isn't
the place for your bullshit.

182
00:08:44,625 --> 00:08:46,761
This is so amateur hour.

183
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:48,195
Platinum, calm down.

184
00:08:49,296 --> 00:08:52,867
Seriously, couples have fucked
and started developing a baby

185
00:08:52,900 --> 00:08:54,935
in the amount of time it takes
this guy to decide to fight.

186
00:08:54,969 --> 00:08:56,871
Even I know this parasite
isn't going to engage.

187
00:08:58,105 --> 00:08:59,607
Platinum, calm down.

188
00:09:00,241 --> 00:09:01,675
I got to pee.

189
00:09:06,914 --> 00:09:08,582
We did everything we could
to get out.

190
00:09:09,350 --> 00:09:13,020
I played the right actors
in this game of life...

191
00:09:13,287 --> 00:09:15,156
- The Chubb illusion.
- Yeah. Yes.

192
00:09:17,291 --> 00:09:18,993
The Chubb illusion.

193
00:09:19,026 --> 00:09:21,595
It reveals that
apparent contrasts of an object

194
00:09:21,629 --> 00:09:22,963
will vary
depending on the context

195
00:09:22,997 --> 00:09:24,065
around the presentation.

196
00:09:24,098 --> 00:09:25,232
I know what it means.

197
00:09:26,634 --> 00:09:28,302
The only reason
I got involved was to...

198
00:09:28,803 --> 00:09:32,039
To secure funds
for a Mandarin copy of my book.

199
00:09:32,073 --> 00:09:34,375
What's the title?

200
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,344
<i>Enemies On the Throne.</i>
It's about my life, you know.

201
00:09:38,245 --> 00:09:39,880
I'm really intrigued.

202
00:09:41,415 --> 00:09:43,250
I'd probably
turn it into a movie.

203
00:09:44,718 --> 00:09:46,687
You're gonna turn
your book and do a movie?

204
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:48,722
Yes, yes. Yes.

205
00:09:49,824 --> 00:09:51,192
Yes, I will.

206
00:09:52,993 --> 00:09:54,762
His book is his life.

207
00:09:56,330 --> 00:09:57,598
And Isabella.

208
00:09:58,065 --> 00:09:59,767
Isabella in his head

209
00:10:00,134 --> 00:10:02,303
is his chance
at life for the book.

210
00:10:03,137 --> 00:10:06,173
His book is the only thing
that justifies him being...

211
00:10:06,207 --> 00:10:07,374
Better than all of us.

212
00:10:07,741 --> 00:10:09,343
He's desperate.

213
00:10:09,376 --> 00:10:11,112
So are we.

214
00:10:11,145 --> 00:10:13,280
But let's not forget,
she might be cute,

215
00:10:13,314 --> 00:10:15,116
sexy and nice,

216
00:10:15,149 --> 00:10:16,817
but she got bazookas
that can blow us up anytime.

217
00:10:16,851 --> 00:10:18,919
Bazooka Bella.

218
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:20,688
Ready to blow us up
any time now.

219
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:21,789
Any time now.

220
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:31,198
Any time.

221
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:34,135
Aiko woke me up
at 3:30 AM...

222
00:10:35,703 --> 00:10:37,171
and in her softest,
kindest voice

223
00:10:37,204 --> 00:10:38,672
she told me to get out...

224
00:10:39,974 --> 00:10:41,642
and told me
our marriage is over.

225
00:10:43,410 --> 00:10:45,379
- Nitro was married.
- To a man?

226
00:10:45,412 --> 00:10:46,780
No, to a woman.

227
00:10:48,816 --> 00:10:49,884
Oh.

228
00:10:52,086 --> 00:10:53,154
Was?

229
00:10:54,488 --> 00:10:55,723
He's divorced.

230
00:10:56,924 --> 00:10:59,059
He is a loquacious coq au fuego.

231
00:11:00,094 --> 00:11:02,763
I don't know what that means,
but I agree with you.

232
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:09,136
I never said the N word.

233
00:11:13,508 --> 00:11:14,808
I believe you.

234
00:11:17,077 --> 00:11:18,746
He's a creature of necessity.

235
00:11:20,181 --> 00:11:22,383
More like elements of necessity.

236
00:11:22,917 --> 00:11:24,485
Platinum, Diamond, Nitro,

237
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:26,720
all elements
of the periodic table.

238
00:11:26,754 --> 00:11:28,989
I said creature of necessity.

239
00:11:32,226 --> 00:11:33,994
Creatures of necessity
sounds better.

240
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:39,300
Divorce seems to have ripped off
a fair chunk of his soul.

241
00:11:41,835 --> 00:11:43,137
So, she must be a real tool

242
00:11:43,170 --> 00:11:44,872
to have married
someone like him.

243
00:11:44,905 --> 00:11:46,173
Ex-wife.
And she isn't a tool.

244
00:11:48,409 --> 00:11:49,476
She's one of those...

245
00:11:52,947 --> 00:11:54,415
She's one of those rare gems

246
00:11:54,448 --> 00:11:56,317
that you experience
just once in a lifetime.

247
00:11:59,119 --> 00:12:00,187
How?

248
00:12:00,487 --> 00:12:01,755
She's like you.

249
00:12:02,856 --> 00:12:03,924
But, uh...

250
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:06,160
you are a movie star.

251
00:12:08,530 --> 00:12:10,965
She walks into a room
and the room stops.

252
00:12:12,233 --> 00:12:14,802
- You're fucking her.
- Absolutely not.

253
00:12:14,835 --> 00:12:16,270
But you love her.

254
00:12:16,303 --> 00:12:17,938
It's okay.
Your secret's safe with me.

255
00:12:17,972 --> 00:12:20,474
No, we're just good friends.

256
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:26,747
Call me Bella.
My friends call me Bella.

257
00:12:27,915 --> 00:12:28,983
Bella.

258
00:12:30,284 --> 00:12:31,986
Your art is real.

259
00:12:32,019 --> 00:12:34,255
It justifies your immortality.

260
00:12:36,390 --> 00:12:39,260
As a child,
I cried watching you sing

261
00:12:39,293 --> 00:12:41,795
<i>Waiting For the Moon</i>
in <i>The Last Sunset.</i>

262
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:44,532
You really do know my work.

263
00:12:44,566 --> 00:12:46,000
<i>The Last Sunset...</i>

264
00:12:46,934 --> 00:12:49,169
I almost wish
I never did that picture.

265
00:12:50,871 --> 00:12:53,541
After it,
money became my top priority.

266
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:56,977
None of my other films
mattered after that.

267
00:12:57,011 --> 00:12:58,078
They matter to me.

268
00:12:59,280 --> 00:13:01,215
The smidgen of time you gave to

269
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:02,816
made that movie perfect.

270
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:06,186
I used to matter.

271
00:13:08,455 --> 00:13:10,057
People wanted to work with me,

272
00:13:11,025 --> 00:13:12,126
wanted to take my picture.

273
00:13:13,027 --> 00:13:15,129
Now, the only way
I get my picture in the news

274
00:13:15,162 --> 00:13:16,230
is through a mugshot.

275
00:13:18,866 --> 00:13:22,136
I will always be habituated
to the work you've left behind.

276
00:13:30,044 --> 00:13:31,879
There is
an undeniable amount of power

277
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:32,980
to being on top.

278
00:13:34,048 --> 00:13:35,249
Makes you invincible.

279
00:13:36,618 --> 00:13:38,452
He absorbed
the weaknesses of others

280
00:13:38,485 --> 00:13:40,321
and it become their strength.

281
00:13:40,354 --> 00:13:43,390
Makes you so much taller

282
00:13:44,291 --> 00:13:45,492
than what you are.

283
00:13:46,960 --> 00:13:48,929
Their pain,

284
00:13:49,363 --> 00:13:52,600
sorrow, failure is

285
00:13:52,634 --> 00:13:55,069
what I feed on to rise.

286
00:13:56,236 --> 00:13:58,005
Even the littlest gesture

287
00:13:58,673 --> 00:13:59,940
could awaken the...

288
00:14:01,241 --> 00:14:02,943
strength of anyone around me.

289
00:14:03,712 --> 00:14:06,246
I want to take
the best of you...

290
00:14:07,615 --> 00:14:09,216
and make it a piece of me.

291
00:14:11,418 --> 00:14:13,555
This is... this is not good.

292
00:14:15,122 --> 00:14:16,423
Oh, this is very bad.

293
00:14:18,593 --> 00:14:20,662
But a good amount of bad
is the same thing

294
00:14:20,695 --> 00:14:22,530
as a bad amount of good.

295
00:14:22,564 --> 00:14:24,231
Let yourself go.

296
00:14:47,988 --> 00:14:49,423
What the fuck?

297
00:14:49,456 --> 00:14:50,592
This is not what you think.

298
00:14:50,625 --> 00:14:52,226
Your tongue was in her mouth

299
00:14:52,259 --> 00:14:53,494
and your hand
was grabbing her ass.

300
00:14:53,528 --> 00:14:55,028
Her naked ass if I might add.

301
00:14:55,062 --> 00:14:56,296
Yes, I know how it might seem.

302
00:14:56,330 --> 00:14:58,265
The perspective is deceiving.

303
00:14:58,298 --> 00:15:00,167
Think, we just added attempted
rape charges against you.

304
00:15:00,200 --> 00:15:02,169
I didn't force myself on her.
It was mutual consent.

305
00:15:02,202 --> 00:15:04,405
Except she's in this house
out of her consent.

306
00:15:04,773 --> 00:15:06,340
Relax, Platinum
and I were just talking.

307
00:15:06,373 --> 00:15:08,108
Nothing happened.

308
00:15:08,142 --> 00:15:10,043
He has a boner
sharper than the Eiffel Tower.

309
00:15:10,077 --> 00:15:11,613
We're just talking.

310
00:15:11,646 --> 00:15:13,947
Wait, wait, wait,
so all that drama earlier

311
00:15:13,981 --> 00:15:15,482
was just to get in her pants.

312
00:15:19,654 --> 00:15:21,255
Where the fuck
do you think you're going?

313
00:15:22,389 --> 00:15:23,957
To my chair.

314
00:15:23,991 --> 00:15:25,225
To be tied up
like the prisoner I am.

315
00:15:28,730 --> 00:15:29,997
Nothing happened.

316
00:15:31,064 --> 00:15:32,199
Sure, nothing happened.

317
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:43,143
I'm all yours.

318
00:15:43,812 --> 00:15:45,279
Hey, guess what, guess what?

319
00:15:45,780 --> 00:15:48,650
Platinum got caught
waving his dick over her

320
00:15:48,683 --> 00:15:51,586
just so he can make out
with her in the bathroom.

321
00:15:51,619 --> 00:15:53,120
Your humor is sublime.

322
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:55,088
You realize that's rape, rape?

323
00:15:55,122 --> 00:15:56,658
Exactly what I said.

324
00:15:56,691 --> 00:15:58,325
We were consenting adults.

325
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:00,194
Being kidnaped by idiots.

326
00:16:00,227 --> 00:16:02,496
Isabella, will you please
tell these two perverts

327
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:04,532
that you initiated
the locking of lips?

328
00:16:06,033 --> 00:16:08,335
Lord, deliver me
from this nightmare.

329
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:10,437
I, Isabella Contini,
an Oscar award winner,

330
00:16:10,471 --> 00:16:12,339
with two Golden Globes
and a Tony nomination

331
00:16:12,372 --> 00:16:16,009
will have to admit
to wanting this, this parasite?

332
00:16:16,043 --> 00:16:18,111
It was my idea.
I made the move.

333
00:16:18,145 --> 00:16:20,582
- Why?
- What do you mean, why?

334
00:16:20,615 --> 00:16:22,316
It's an honest question.

335
00:16:22,349 --> 00:16:24,117
Why did you make the first move?

336
00:16:24,752 --> 00:16:26,654
Did she do it to survive?

337
00:16:27,254 --> 00:16:30,758
Or were you just
so sexy she couldn't resist?

338
00:16:30,792 --> 00:16:32,794
Don't answer the question,
Miss Contini.

339
00:16:32,827 --> 00:16:34,696
We need to focus
on our next move.

340
00:16:34,729 --> 00:16:37,197
- The next move.
- There's only one thing left.

341
00:16:37,231 --> 00:16:39,132
Isabella must die.

342
00:16:39,166 --> 00:16:41,068
You don't have to kill me.

343
00:16:41,503 --> 00:16:43,437
We're open to ideas.

344
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:46,440
Look, I understand

345
00:16:46,473 --> 00:16:47,742
why you're doing this, okay?

346
00:16:47,775 --> 00:16:49,777
I know how you people feel.

347
00:16:53,581 --> 00:16:55,349
Isabella must die.

348
00:16:55,382 --> 00:16:56,450
Look...

349
00:16:57,184 --> 00:16:59,486
you all talked
to my mother, right?

350
00:16:59,521 --> 00:17:01,288
You never once
let me talk to her.

351
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,390
Let me call her.
She's my manager.

352
00:17:05,225 --> 00:17:06,761
I will get her
to send you the money

353
00:17:07,261 --> 00:17:09,329
and everything else
that you need.

354
00:17:09,631 --> 00:17:12,366
- That's not a bad idea.
- That's worse than bad.

355
00:17:12,399 --> 00:17:14,301
Worse than bad.
They'll track the phones.

356
00:17:14,334 --> 00:17:16,169
- We use the burners.
- They can track burners, too.

357
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:18,673
- They need 30 seconds.
- All I need is 20 seconds, max.

358
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,241
When she hears my voice,

359
00:17:21,275 --> 00:17:22,442
my fear, she's going to know
this is real.

360
00:17:29,116 --> 00:17:30,618
20 seconds. 20.

361
00:17:31,485 --> 00:17:33,521
Dial star 69 first.

362
00:17:33,555 --> 00:17:35,489
Put it on speaker. Speaker.

363
00:17:35,523 --> 00:17:37,057
Okay. Okay.
Can I stand up?

364
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:41,428
Don't have to point any...
Okay. okay.

365
00:17:51,839 --> 00:17:53,206
<i>Uh, What now?</i>

366
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:54,642
Mom, it's me.

367
00:17:54,676 --> 00:17:56,143
Look, I don't have
a lot of time.

368
00:17:56,176 --> 00:17:57,612
I really have been kidnapped.

369
00:17:57,645 --> 00:17:58,746
I need you
to send these men the money.

370
00:17:58,780 --> 00:18:00,582
<i>Really, Bella?</i>

371
00:18:00,615 --> 00:18:03,383
<i>You had me crying
on TV looking for you</i>

372
00:18:03,417 --> 00:18:06,588
<i>while you're out
on your drug safari again.</i>

373
00:18:06,621 --> 00:18:09,256
<i>You're getting too old
for these kind of games.</i>

374
00:18:09,289 --> 00:18:11,124
This isn't
a fucking game, Mother.

375
00:18:11,158 --> 00:18:14,461
I have been tied up to
a chair for 13 goddamn days.

376
00:18:14,494 --> 00:18:16,196
<i>Watch your tone with me,
young lady!</i>

377
00:18:18,198 --> 00:18:19,701
I'm sorry, Mom.

378
00:18:19,734 --> 00:18:21,836
<i>I'm late
for pilates with Ramone.</i>

379
00:18:21,869 --> 00:18:24,572
<i>You know how difficult it is
to get an appointment with him</i>

380
00:18:24,606 --> 00:18:26,206
<i>since he's worked with Michelle.</i>

381
00:18:26,239 --> 00:18:28,241
Mom, this really is...

382
00:18:28,275 --> 00:18:30,243
<i>Ta ta.</i>

383
00:18:36,684 --> 00:18:37,752
Do...

384
00:18:38,086 --> 00:18:40,220
Do you want to call her back?

385
00:18:47,695 --> 00:18:50,531
Don't touch me.
Don't fucking touch me.

386
00:18:50,565 --> 00:18:52,332
I don't want to hear about you

387
00:18:52,366 --> 00:18:54,636
or your stupid, fucking book.

388
00:18:54,669 --> 00:18:56,771
Stay away from me.
Stay the fuck way from me.

389
00:19:13,688 --> 00:19:15,623
You got us into this conundrum.

390
00:19:15,657 --> 00:19:17,558
Don't put this on me because
she doesn't like your book.

391
00:19:17,592 --> 00:19:19,627
At least I wrote a book.
Can you write a sentence?

392
00:19:19,661 --> 00:19:21,763
I don't know how to write book,
but I know how to pay my bills.

393
00:19:23,296 --> 00:19:26,299
You exist for nothing.

394
00:19:26,333 --> 00:19:29,403
Are we sensitive, man?
Did I make you sad?

395
00:19:29,436 --> 00:19:31,739
You know what, I am getting
tired of your untamed words.

396
00:19:31,773 --> 00:19:33,340
So what are you
going to do about it?

397
00:19:33,373 --> 00:19:34,976
- You knew this would happen.
- What?

398
00:19:35,009 --> 00:19:36,511
She wanted to tell you the truth
about your stupid book.

399
00:19:36,544 --> 00:19:38,713
When words fail,
the fists decide.

400
00:19:38,746 --> 00:19:40,213
After you.

401
00:19:52,325 --> 00:19:53,761
Are they really going to fight?

402
00:19:53,795 --> 00:19:56,564
- Yes.
- Do they do this all the time?

403
00:19:56,597 --> 00:19:58,498
- No.
- You do realize that they both

404
00:19:58,533 --> 00:20:00,568
- have guns, right?
- Yeah.

405
00:20:00,601 --> 00:20:02,335
Why didn't you stop them?

406
00:20:02,369 --> 00:20:03,437
I'm not sure.

407
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:05,405
Not sure.

408
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,642
You could still stop them.

409
00:20:14,214 --> 00:20:16,249
Three little pigs
walk out the door...

410
00:20:17,719 --> 00:20:20,287
the stiffy,
the parasite and the fragile.

411
00:20:22,456 --> 00:20:23,791
Which one comes back first?

412
00:20:25,425 --> 00:20:26,594
I know what you're thinking.

413
00:20:27,795 --> 00:20:29,530
Why would I aggravate
my kidnapper?

414
00:20:29,564 --> 00:20:31,431
Well, honestly,
I really didn't think

415
00:20:31,465 --> 00:20:32,700
he was going to
take the hood off.

416
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:34,736
I mean,
I've been treated like an egg

417
00:20:34,769 --> 00:20:36,470
for the past 13 days.

418
00:20:37,105 --> 00:20:38,405
I'm not saying
there's a guidebook

419
00:20:38,438 --> 00:20:39,974
for kidnappers out there.

420
00:20:40,007 --> 00:20:41,408
But, you know,
a few punches are slaps to put

421
00:20:41,441 --> 00:20:42,476
the fear of God into your victim

422
00:20:42,510 --> 00:20:44,411
would be professional.

423
00:20:44,444 --> 00:20:46,881
All these bitches have done
is swing their guns around

424
00:20:46,914 --> 00:20:48,816
with the safeties on
is pathetic.

425
00:20:50,685 --> 00:20:51,753
And last.

426
00:20:53,621 --> 00:20:56,423
I'm an addict tied
to a fucking chair.

427
00:20:57,592 --> 00:21:00,293
Let's see you keep your cool
going through withdrawal.

428
00:21:08,368 --> 00:21:10,671
You're probably wondering,
why doesn't she just

429
00:21:10,705 --> 00:21:12,472
untie the knots,
break the chair,

430
00:21:12,507 --> 00:21:14,642
smash the window
and escape this haunted?

431
00:21:17,344 --> 00:21:19,547
That shit only happens
in the movies.

432
00:21:19,580 --> 00:21:22,917
Honey! I'm home.

433
00:21:23,918 --> 00:21:25,787
Fuck me sideways.

434
00:21:30,825 --> 00:21:31,993
We need to get down.

435
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:41,434
Really?

436
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:46,040
Woo!

437
00:21:47,875 --> 00:21:49,510
I just felt like dancing.

438
00:21:50,211 --> 00:21:51,746
Could you not
just feel like dancing

439
00:21:51,779 --> 00:21:53,380
or pissing on your territory?

440
00:21:54,081 --> 00:21:57,417
Hope you realize
I'm the one with the gun.

441
00:21:57,450 --> 00:21:58,853
Let's get this over with.

442
00:21:59,554 --> 00:22:01,354
I need a bath.

443
00:22:01,388 --> 00:22:03,958
I'm tired of cheap burgers,
and my ass really hurts.

444
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:06,359
For the last time,
I'm the one with the gun.

445
00:22:06,894 --> 00:22:07,962
Oh, honey...

446
00:22:08,996 --> 00:22:10,598
I'm not the one that hurt you.

447
00:22:10,631 --> 00:22:12,399
What the fuck
are you talking about?

448
00:22:12,432 --> 00:22:14,902
Don't play dumb.
I know you just got divorced.

449
00:22:15,937 --> 00:22:17,038
Does everyone know?

450
00:22:18,172 --> 00:22:19,640
Women have
a different definition

451
00:22:19,674 --> 00:22:20,741
of marriage these days.

452
00:22:22,577 --> 00:22:24,512
Let's not get carried away.
Finish the job.

453
00:22:25,746 --> 00:22:27,682
How do you know this?

454
00:22:27,715 --> 00:22:29,817
How the fuck
does everyone know this?

455
00:22:30,985 --> 00:22:32,053
I was married

456
00:22:32,485 --> 00:22:34,689
when I was 18
to avoid my mother.

457
00:22:35,857 --> 00:22:37,925
It was all about me, me, me.

458
00:22:40,828 --> 00:22:42,630
He was an angel too.

459
00:22:43,931 --> 00:22:45,398
He worshipped me.

460
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:49,003
I just kept finding

461
00:22:49,036 --> 00:22:52,439
the tiniest things
that just hit him.

462
00:22:55,509 --> 00:22:57,812
And I ignored all
ordinary things he did right.

463
00:23:00,447 --> 00:23:03,450
I remember when
I got my divorce. I, uh...

464
00:23:05,219 --> 00:23:06,486
Shit.

465
00:23:07,755 --> 00:23:08,856
Sorry, I'm doing it again.

466
00:23:08,890 --> 00:23:10,091
I'm getting carried away.

467
00:23:10,524 --> 00:23:12,727
Hurry,
before your friends come back.

468
00:23:13,694 --> 00:23:15,029
Get what over with?

469
00:23:16,130 --> 00:23:17,430
You want to kill me.

470
00:23:17,899 --> 00:23:20,768
Yeah, yeah, I did.
No, no, no, no, I do.

471
00:23:23,237 --> 00:23:25,806
- I'm ready.
- For the record,

472
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:27,541
I know you're
screwing with my head.

473
00:23:27,575 --> 00:23:28,743
You're the one with the gun.

474
00:23:28,776 --> 00:23:29,710
I'm the one with the gun.

475
00:23:29,744 --> 00:23:31,178
You're the one with the power.

476
00:23:31,212 --> 00:23:32,412
I'm the one with the power.

477
00:23:35,983 --> 00:23:38,052
You have the power
to give my life back to me.

478
00:23:40,755 --> 00:23:41,822
Or end me.

479
00:23:42,590 --> 00:23:44,158
You shouldn't have
called me a nigger.

480
00:23:45,927 --> 00:23:47,061
I never said that word.

481
00:23:47,094 --> 00:23:49,196
You have no one here to play to.

482
00:23:49,230 --> 00:23:52,166
It's just you and me.
You called me a nigger.

483
00:23:52,199 --> 00:23:54,168
I never said that word.

484
00:23:54,201 --> 00:23:56,537
I have heard
many words wrong in my life.

485
00:23:56,570 --> 00:23:58,940
But no black person has ever
heard that word wrong.

486
00:24:00,775 --> 00:24:01,842
Do what you have to do.

487
00:24:02,877 --> 00:24:04,011
Admit it.

488
00:24:04,045 --> 00:24:05,913
I never said that word.

489
00:24:07,214 --> 00:24:08,783
What about now?

490
00:24:10,251 --> 00:24:11,519
Look at me.

491
00:24:13,921 --> 00:24:15,488
Look at me.

492
00:24:15,523 --> 00:24:16,590
No.

493
00:24:17,391 --> 00:24:19,593
The last thing I see
before I meet my maker

494
00:24:19,627 --> 00:24:21,996
is not going to be
the barrel of your gun.

495
00:24:29,270 --> 00:24:30,538
Open your eyes.

496
00:24:33,040 --> 00:24:34,108
I won't shoot you.

497
00:24:38,946 --> 00:24:40,781
What now?

498
00:24:40,815 --> 00:24:41,816
You shouldn't have
called me a nigger.

499
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:43,217
This is getting boring.

500
00:24:43,651 --> 00:24:45,686
You said I said it.
I said I didn't.

501
00:24:45,720 --> 00:24:47,722
The fact of the matter is,
you have the gun.

502
00:24:47,922 --> 00:24:49,256
You have the power.

503
00:24:49,724 --> 00:24:52,860
It's extremely intriguing
to see how weak a man really is

504
00:24:52,893 --> 00:24:54,195
when he's dependent on a gun.

505
00:24:55,129 --> 00:24:56,197
Look at this fool.

506
00:24:56,964 --> 00:24:58,165
He can't shoot me.

507
00:24:58,532 --> 00:25:00,134
He's not capable
of killing anyone.

508
00:25:00,167 --> 00:25:01,702
So, what does he do?

509
00:25:01,736 --> 00:25:03,604
He uses the gun
to try and humiliate me.

510
00:25:04,939 --> 00:25:06,540
You think
you got this figured out?

511
00:25:07,842 --> 00:25:09,810
You're the big,
bad man with the gun.

512
00:25:10,344 --> 00:25:11,746
You think I can't kill you?

513
00:25:13,681 --> 00:25:15,583
I can't take this anymore.

514
00:25:15,616 --> 00:25:17,084
That's not true.

515
00:25:17,852 --> 00:25:20,087
I believe that you're a sad,

516
00:25:20,821 --> 00:25:22,723
poor, little boy

517
00:25:22,757 --> 00:25:25,760
whose only strength comes
from the weapon in his hand.

518
00:25:25,793 --> 00:25:27,261
You can't kill me.

519
00:25:27,862 --> 00:25:30,264
That's why you're trying
to boost your killer mentality

520
00:25:30,297 --> 00:25:32,199
by forcing me to say the N-word.

521
00:25:32,233 --> 00:25:33,667
Then say it!

522
00:25:35,036 --> 00:25:38,072
- You're an impotent man.
- Oh, impotent!

523
00:25:38,105 --> 00:25:40,174
You do realize your wife
is fucking someone else

524
00:25:40,207 --> 00:25:41,609
for a reason, right?

525
00:25:43,044 --> 00:25:44,178
Oh, shit.

526
00:25:44,211 --> 00:25:46,047
Okay,

527
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:47,782
That's probably a bit too far.

528
00:25:50,084 --> 00:25:54,588
So, I work for a family value

529
00:25:54,622 --> 00:25:56,791
Christian senator...

530
00:25:57,458 --> 00:26:00,961
who liked his hookers under 21

531
00:26:02,063 --> 00:26:04,799
and his coke clean.

532
00:26:05,132 --> 00:26:09,370
So, I've been to the building.
I've walked up it 100 times,

533
00:26:09,403 --> 00:26:11,005
and see you there.

534
00:26:14,108 --> 00:26:17,078
Next time I'm there,
same place, same time.

535
00:26:17,111 --> 00:26:18,145
There you are

536
00:26:18,913 --> 00:26:20,114
So, I made a move.

537
00:26:21,048 --> 00:26:23,984
13 days later.

538
00:26:24,285 --> 00:26:26,253
This is like the stupid movies

539
00:26:26,287 --> 00:26:28,756
where the bad guy tells you
his plans for world domination

540
00:26:28,789 --> 00:26:30,891
instead of just
shooting the hero.

541
00:26:31,992 --> 00:26:33,861
All I have the show for it is

542
00:26:33,894 --> 00:26:36,197
your mother would appear
on every talk show

543
00:26:36,230 --> 00:26:37,631
and share her heart.

544
00:26:38,432 --> 00:26:40,935
But not a dollar
for her own daughter?

545
00:26:42,103 --> 00:26:44,638
Isabella Contini.

546
00:26:44,672 --> 00:26:45,973
You have nobody.

547
00:26:48,209 --> 00:26:50,311
Your own mother
won't pay the ransom.

548
00:26:50,344 --> 00:26:52,746
Fuck, I'm about to die! Shit!

549
00:26:56,383 --> 00:26:57,651
Screw you.

550
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,122
If you're going to shoot me,

551
00:27:01,155 --> 00:27:02,790
shoot me in the face,
not the back.

552
00:27:03,290 --> 00:27:05,059
If I can have anyone killed,

553
00:27:05,459 --> 00:27:07,194
I would have
had you killed an hour ago.

554
00:27:11,198 --> 00:27:12,900
Why are you letting me go?

555
00:27:18,772 --> 00:27:19,840
You know...

556
00:27:21,475 --> 00:27:25,279
we live in a world
where demons are misunderstood,

557
00:27:26,480 --> 00:27:28,315
vampires are cool,
witches are cute,

558
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:29,884
and Lucifer has a show.

559
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:34,155
Life gets better.

560
00:27:35,222 --> 00:27:36,323
Why are you still here?

561
00:27:39,927 --> 00:27:41,795
The Senator you work for?

562
00:27:42,396 --> 00:27:43,430
What's his name?

563
00:27:45,132 --> 00:27:46,700
You realize how dumb it'd be

564
00:27:46,734 --> 00:27:48,169
for me to answer that
question, right?

565
00:27:51,739 --> 00:27:54,175
My mother's third husband
is Senator Grummer.

566
00:27:54,543 --> 00:27:57,178
Would be a wild coincidence
if you worked for him.

567
00:27:57,211 --> 00:27:58,746
So you believe

568
00:27:59,046 --> 00:28:00,314
your mother's ex-husband

569
00:28:00,681 --> 00:28:02,183
who is a sitting senator

570
00:28:02,483 --> 00:28:04,318
decides to hire us

571
00:28:04,351 --> 00:28:05,886
to kidnap you because?

572
00:28:05,920 --> 00:28:08,756
I never told you
they were divorced.

573
00:28:08,789 --> 00:28:11,058
You're seeming to forget
you're about to die.

574
00:28:11,091 --> 00:28:12,159
Yeah.

575
00:28:13,327 --> 00:28:14,395
Sorry.

576
00:28:18,465 --> 00:28:19,733
Please indulge me.

577
00:28:21,101 --> 00:28:22,369
How much was the ransom?

578
00:28:24,405 --> 00:28:26,407
A hundred million.

579
00:28:26,440 --> 00:28:28,209
Where did you think my mother
would find that kind of money?

580
00:28:30,311 --> 00:28:31,412
A million?

581
00:28:31,445 --> 00:28:33,047
A million.

582
00:28:33,080 --> 00:28:35,883
The woman didn't cave.
To save our face

583
00:28:37,084 --> 00:28:38,886
we told her we meant
a million pesos.

584
00:28:39,853 --> 00:28:41,755
- Pesos?
- She didn't bulge.

585
00:28:42,489 --> 00:28:45,392
I mean, even worse, the news
had you missing, not kidnapped.

586
00:28:46,794 --> 00:28:47,861
Pesos?

587
00:28:48,697 --> 00:28:50,532
You may not see it now,
but your mother loves...

588
00:28:50,565 --> 00:28:52,499
Oh, she loves me so much,

589
00:28:52,534 --> 00:28:54,969
she couldn't pay
1,000,000 pesos?

590
00:28:58,072 --> 00:28:59,240
Go home, Isabella.

591
00:29:11,852 --> 00:29:13,387
He's a methodical machine.

592
00:29:13,420 --> 00:29:15,122
Why would he stupidly
take off her hood?

593
00:29:15,155 --> 00:29:17,057
The N-word.

594
00:29:17,091 --> 00:29:18,759
The N-word means a lot more
than you and I understand.

595
00:29:19,393 --> 00:29:20,461
Whatever.

596
00:29:21,328 --> 00:29:23,163
My blood's boiling.

597
00:29:23,197 --> 00:29:25,533
It will soon be over.
It will soon be over.

598
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:27,134
The buffoon was right.

599
00:29:28,002 --> 00:29:29,036
Our well's dry.

600
00:29:29,604 --> 00:29:31,105
People have created
Go Fund Me groups

601
00:29:31,138 --> 00:29:32,439
to pay more for the homeless.

602
00:29:32,473 --> 00:29:33,407
The Internet had her net worth

603
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,242
over 40 million.

604
00:29:35,276 --> 00:29:36,477
But, we should have
known better than to invest

605
00:29:36,511 --> 00:29:37,512
in the veracity of the Internet.

606
00:29:37,545 --> 00:29:38,479
No backing out now.

607
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:40,347
No backing out.

608
00:29:40,749 --> 00:29:43,217
Nitro kills her.
We move on.

609
00:29:43,250 --> 00:29:45,152
Time is an unfaithful mistress.

610
00:29:45,185 --> 00:29:47,054
Do you think
he's taking his time now

611
00:29:47,288 --> 00:29:49,156
by savoring the weight
of her last breath?

612
00:29:49,189 --> 00:29:50,357
Why do you talk this way?

613
00:29:51,859 --> 00:29:53,561
Why do you echo your words?

614
00:29:53,595 --> 00:29:54,862
What do you mean?

615
00:29:56,297 --> 00:29:57,532
Seriously?
What do you mean?

616
00:29:59,466 --> 00:30:00,535
I rest my case.

617
00:30:07,007 --> 00:30:08,075
What's up?

618
00:30:09,276 --> 00:30:11,879
It's a beautiful day.

619
00:30:32,066 --> 00:30:33,500
Hands in the air, please.

620
00:30:34,168 --> 00:30:35,235
Dude.

621
00:30:35,670 --> 00:30:37,471
Dude, you want someone
to call the cops?

622
00:30:39,106 --> 00:30:41,241
Wow. You're strong.

623
00:30:42,076 --> 00:30:43,143
Very strong.

624
00:30:43,177 --> 00:30:44,244
Did you kill him?

625
00:30:44,646 --> 00:30:46,380
- Kill who?
- Nitro.

626
00:30:48,082 --> 00:30:50,084
No. He let me go?

627
00:30:51,653 --> 00:30:53,387
He did what? Mother...

628
00:30:54,988 --> 00:30:56,423
Such an empty barrel.

629
00:30:56,457 --> 00:30:59,126
All talk and no action.
No fucking action!

630
00:31:01,995 --> 00:31:03,464
- Please let me go.
- I'm not going to jail.

631
00:31:04,331 --> 00:31:05,933
I won't tell anyone.

632
00:31:05,966 --> 00:31:07,434
They have me missing,
not kidnapped.

633
00:31:07,468 --> 00:31:08,636
I could walk home
right now and no one's

634
00:31:08,670 --> 00:31:10,371
going to take this seriously.

635
00:31:10,404 --> 00:31:11,673
Your mother has been
on every news station

636
00:31:11,706 --> 00:31:13,541
and made this very serious.

637
00:31:13,575 --> 00:31:15,142
Very serious.

638
00:31:15,175 --> 00:31:16,611
Yeah, well,
she's a lousy manager

639
00:31:16,644 --> 00:31:17,645
and a failed actress
looking for roles

640
00:31:17,679 --> 00:31:19,246
through my predicament.

641
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:20,481
I'm not going to jail.
I'm too pretty.

642
00:31:20,515 --> 00:31:22,015
I will get raped.

643
00:31:22,383 --> 00:31:24,184
I promise you, I'm not going to
tell a soul about this.

644
00:31:24,218 --> 00:31:26,086
I want to believe you,
but I don't.

645
00:31:28,122 --> 00:31:29,624
I thought you were a fan.

646
00:31:29,657 --> 00:31:31,358
I am.
But my life comes first.

647
00:31:31,392 --> 00:31:32,926
Raise your hands higher.

648
00:31:42,737 --> 00:31:46,039
Isabella must die.
Isabella must die.

649
00:31:46,073 --> 00:31:48,342
Really, Nitro?
You're such a bitch.

650
00:31:48,375 --> 00:31:50,210
Did she let you
peer at a boob, Nitro?

651
00:31:50,244 --> 00:31:52,012
I whipped your ass once
and I can do it again.

652
00:31:52,045 --> 00:31:53,280
You got me with a sucker punch.

653
00:31:53,313 --> 00:31:55,082
We can do it again.

654
00:31:55,115 --> 00:31:56,150
Your counsel is desired,
the last bout, four words

655
00:31:56,183 --> 00:31:57,284
rid of its genesis.

656
00:31:57,317 --> 00:31:59,286
Isabella Contini must die.

657
00:31:59,319 --> 00:32:00,555
Yet, look what sits before me.

658
00:32:00,588 --> 00:32:02,022
Isabella perched on her throne.

659
00:32:02,055 --> 00:32:03,390
Nitro, help me to understand.

660
00:32:03,424 --> 00:32:05,125
Why the fuck did you let her go?

661
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:06,528
Why did he let me go?

662
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:08,996
You had no intention
of killing her from the start.

663
00:32:09,029 --> 00:32:11,432
You expected us to say no.
You wanted us to say no.

664
00:32:11,465 --> 00:32:14,101
- That doesn't make sense.
- I took the fucking hood off.

665
00:32:14,968 --> 00:32:16,671
I'm the smartest person
in this room,

666
00:32:16,704 --> 00:32:18,640
and I literally
don't know what that means.

667
00:32:18,673 --> 00:32:20,941
The minute I took the hood off
I killed her because of...

668
00:32:22,309 --> 00:32:24,178
Aiko, I played God.

669
00:32:25,479 --> 00:32:27,247
I can't even
make my marriage work.

670
00:32:27,715 --> 00:32:30,250
I live in a shoe box.
I lost my home.

671
00:32:30,284 --> 00:32:32,654
I lost my kids.
Lost custody of the damn dog.

672
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:35,189
I mean, who am I to play God?

673
00:32:35,222 --> 00:32:36,691
He's lost it.

674
00:32:36,724 --> 00:32:38,492
Yeah, if the prospect of life

675
00:32:38,526 --> 00:32:40,327
in prison getting
sodomized by some hairy gorilla

676
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:42,362
isn't incentive enough
to wave her life goodbye,

677
00:32:42,396 --> 00:32:44,097
then I would take
the burden off your hands.

678
00:32:44,131 --> 00:32:45,633
What are you doing, Nitro?

679
00:32:45,667 --> 00:32:47,334
Did you not just hear my speech?

680
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:49,537
- She has to go.
- Drop the fucking gun, Platinum.

681
00:32:49,571 --> 00:32:51,271
Why is your weapon
geared at <i>moi?</i>

682
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:53,273
Nitro, drop your weapon!

683
00:32:53,307 --> 00:32:55,209
Nitro, you test my patience.
Turn your metal away from me.

684
00:32:55,242 --> 00:32:57,579
- Take your gun off of her.
- Isabella Contini must die.

685
00:32:57,612 --> 00:32:59,112
Stop saying that.

686
00:32:59,146 --> 00:33:00,515
It hurts my ears
when you say that.

687
00:33:00,548 --> 00:33:02,149
What's that supposed to mean?

688
00:33:02,182 --> 00:33:03,651
It only sounds good
when I say it.

689
00:33:03,685 --> 00:33:05,653
Have I died and gone to hell?

690
00:33:05,687 --> 00:33:08,322
- Nitro, drop your gun.
- Tell him to put his gun down.

691
00:33:08,355 --> 00:33:10,057
Options are lost, Nitro.
She has to go.

692
00:33:10,090 --> 00:33:11,425
This was of your making.

693
00:33:11,458 --> 00:33:13,460
Yes, it was.
She doesn't have to die.

694
00:33:13,494 --> 00:33:14,796
Choices are for nought.

695
00:33:14,829 --> 00:33:16,698
Choices is what choices are.

696
00:33:16,731 --> 00:33:18,365
What the fuck
is that supposed to mean?

697
00:33:18,398 --> 00:33:19,601
I don't know
what it fucking means.

698
00:33:19,634 --> 00:33:21,301
It sounded good in my head.

699
00:33:21,335 --> 00:33:22,302
Turn your weapon of death
away from me.

700
00:33:22,336 --> 00:33:23,771
Drop your weapon.

701
00:33:23,805 --> 00:33:25,439
You couldn't kill
a woman you hardly know.

702
00:33:25,472 --> 00:33:27,040
Now, you want me
to believe you'd kill me?

703
00:33:27,074 --> 00:33:28,710
Kevin.
Kevin, please drop your weapon.

704
00:33:28,743 --> 00:33:30,612
It doesn't have to go this way.

705
00:33:30,645 --> 00:33:32,112
You said it, brother.
There's no other way.

706
00:33:32,145 --> 00:33:33,648
This is a one-way street.

707
00:33:33,681 --> 00:33:36,183
Her blood will be on our hands.

708
00:33:36,751 --> 00:33:39,721
You've done your part
in trying to save her.

709
00:33:39,754 --> 00:33:41,623
You aren't the one
pulling the trigger.

710
00:33:41,656 --> 00:33:43,490
I took the fucking hood off.

711
00:33:43,525 --> 00:33:45,192
The arrow has left the bow.
We can't pull it back.

712
00:33:45,225 --> 00:33:48,228
Please, please
don't make me shoot you.

713
00:33:48,830 --> 00:33:50,097
You'd kill one of your own?

714
00:33:51,231 --> 00:33:52,834
You'd shoot me for her?

715
00:33:52,867 --> 00:33:55,135
Fuck you, Nitro.

716
00:33:55,168 --> 00:33:56,771
Wait, wait.
Everyone, wait.

717
00:33:56,804 --> 00:33:58,071
- There's no other way.
- There is a way.

718
00:33:58,606 --> 00:33:59,674
The Prince.

719
00:34:02,476 --> 00:34:04,779
- The Prince.
- He's real?

720
00:34:04,812 --> 00:34:06,614
He's in Johnston City.

721
00:34:06,648 --> 00:34:09,049
I tried selling him this house.
This house.

722
00:34:09,584 --> 00:34:11,351
I doubt
he handles this kind of shit.

723
00:34:11,586 --> 00:34:13,755
I can ask. I can ask.

724
00:34:15,857 --> 00:34:18,593
He's a fixer.
What's the alternative?

725
00:34:18,626 --> 00:34:20,260
We have
two dead bodies over here?

726
00:34:20,294 --> 00:34:21,529
There'd only be
one dead body in here.

727
00:34:21,563 --> 00:34:23,196
Fratricide isn't in him.

728
00:34:23,230 --> 00:34:24,799
Sorry, brother,
but I can't have the blood

729
00:34:24,832 --> 00:34:26,568
of an innocent woman
carrying on my conscious.

730
00:34:28,268 --> 00:34:29,336
Innocent?

731
00:34:29,837 --> 00:34:31,104
This drug addict?

732
00:34:32,406 --> 00:34:33,708
A woman so repugnant
her own mother

733
00:34:33,741 --> 00:34:35,710
doesn't want to pay her ransom.

734
00:34:35,743 --> 00:34:37,645
Fucking fairweather fans.

735
00:34:37,679 --> 00:34:39,514
I took the hood off.

736
00:34:39,547 --> 00:34:40,848
Her life belongs to me
until she walks away from here.

737
00:34:40,882 --> 00:34:43,317
You will not kill me.

738
00:34:43,350 --> 00:34:45,218
Platinum, if you so much
as pressure the trigger,

739
00:34:45,252 --> 00:34:47,220
your brain is going to
become a Picasso on the floor.

740
00:34:47,254 --> 00:34:48,422
- You're bluffing.
- Am I?

741
00:34:48,455 --> 00:34:49,891
Yes, you are, brother.

742
00:34:49,924 --> 00:34:51,291
You haven't
pulled the trigger either.

743
00:34:51,325 --> 00:34:52,794
Yes, but I will, brother.

744
00:34:56,798 --> 00:34:58,533
How'd you know
I signed my divorce papers?

745
00:34:59,701 --> 00:35:00,868
What?

746
00:35:01,234 --> 00:35:03,170
How did you know
my 12-year marriage ended

747
00:35:03,203 --> 00:35:05,238
with the mother
of my children a few days ago?

748
00:35:15,482 --> 00:35:16,718
Call the Prince.

749
00:35:20,922 --> 00:35:22,790
I'm making the call.

750
00:35:22,824 --> 00:35:25,192
Can you please
drop the guns now?

751
00:35:26,694 --> 00:35:28,128
It's George.

752
00:35:28,896 --> 00:35:30,197
Are you still in the city?

753
00:35:37,605 --> 00:35:39,674
This is
the worst day of my life.

754
00:35:42,944 --> 00:35:44,378
What am I supposed to do now?

755
00:35:47,749 --> 00:35:50,551
You know, I never believed
in God or the afterlife.

756
00:35:50,585 --> 00:35:54,354
The concept of a god who'd
create such fucked up world,

757
00:35:54,388 --> 00:35:57,224
it didn't make
any sense to me, but...

758
00:35:59,560 --> 00:36:00,862
right now, I'm a believer.

759
00:36:03,731 --> 00:36:04,799
I don't want to die.

760
00:36:07,434 --> 00:36:09,269
And if I die,
I don't want to go to hell.

761
00:36:10,104 --> 00:36:16,611
I have done and said
a lot of fucked up shit.

762
00:36:18,579 --> 00:36:19,647
Shit.

763
00:36:22,349 --> 00:36:24,652
In hindsight, I'm a stupid
insult to parasite's book.

764
00:36:29,957 --> 00:36:31,425
Damn It.
Why aren't they talking?

765
00:36:37,765 --> 00:36:39,366
We're lucky. Very lucky.

766
00:36:39,399 --> 00:36:41,234
He's some few blocks off.

767
00:36:41,268 --> 00:36:43,470
10 minutes.
He'll be here in 10 minutes.

768
00:36:45,773 --> 00:36:47,775
- 10 minutes.
- Wow.

769
00:36:47,809 --> 00:36:48,876
That was intense.

770
00:36:49,744 --> 00:36:51,546
Really intense, huh?

771
00:36:54,515 --> 00:36:56,984
Come on, guys.
We're the Three Musketeers.

772
00:36:57,018 --> 00:36:58,619
The Three Musketeers.

773
00:36:58,653 --> 00:36:59,821
You're making me nervous.

774
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,723
Very nervous.
Say something.

775
00:37:09,530 --> 00:37:11,231
How long
you been fucking my wife?

776
00:37:12,667 --> 00:37:14,501
I meant something happier.

777
00:37:14,535 --> 00:37:16,871
- I never said that.
- You just did.

778
00:37:16,904 --> 00:37:19,540
You said it all
without saying nothing at all.

779
00:37:23,511 --> 00:37:25,445
Was it your fancy words
that got her out of my bed?

780
00:37:26,848 --> 00:37:28,049
Isn't the place for this.

781
00:37:28,082 --> 00:37:29,416
Let me guess.

782
00:37:29,449 --> 00:37:31,052
You were her shoulder to cry on

783
00:37:31,085 --> 00:37:32,787
when I wouldn't hold hands
with her at the park.

784
00:37:32,820 --> 00:37:34,354
Keeping her company
when I worked overtime

785
00:37:34,387 --> 00:37:35,823
to pay for the big, fancy house,

786
00:37:35,857 --> 00:37:37,357
she'd like
to show off to her friends.

787
00:37:37,390 --> 00:37:38,593
Platinum,
tell him it's not true.

788
00:37:38,626 --> 00:37:39,894
It's not true.

789
00:37:40,427 --> 00:37:42,797
We are long past
fake names, George.

790
00:37:42,830 --> 00:37:44,766
Yeah, Perry.
Tell me to my face

791
00:37:44,799 --> 00:37:46,466
you had
nothing to do with my wife.

792
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:48,335
Tell him, Platinum. Tell him.

793
00:37:48,870 --> 00:37:50,738
His name is Perry.
Your name is George.

794
00:37:50,772 --> 00:37:52,673
And I'm Kevin.
It's out there.

795
00:37:52,707 --> 00:37:54,008
She knows our fucking names.

796
00:37:54,041 --> 00:37:55,810
Tell him
so we can move past this.

797
00:37:55,843 --> 00:37:57,512
We need to move past this.

798
00:37:57,545 --> 00:37:58,613
Seven minutes.

799
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:01,048
You seem disappointed, George.

800
00:38:01,414 --> 00:38:02,750
What do you expect?

801
00:38:03,151 --> 00:38:04,886
You thought
he would repeat what you said?

802
00:38:06,419 --> 00:38:08,421
It's easy for a man
to steal someone's wife

803
00:38:08,455 --> 00:38:10,357
when she comes
to you as the hero.

804
00:38:12,994 --> 00:38:14,662
And she tells you
how much she's suffering

805
00:38:14,695 --> 00:38:15,763
under her mean husband.

806
00:38:17,799 --> 00:38:19,000
And in a bedroom,

807
00:38:19,399 --> 00:38:21,903
she gives
100% of herself to her hero

808
00:38:22,603 --> 00:38:24,572
while her evil husband
isn't there.

809
00:38:25,940 --> 00:38:28,843
A cheating wife always chooses
her love with precision.

810
00:38:28,876 --> 00:38:30,845
Secrecy is very important.

811
00:38:30,878 --> 00:38:34,015
That's why our friend
is always the perfect target.

812
00:38:34,048 --> 00:38:35,550
Five minutes.

813
00:38:35,583 --> 00:38:37,350
Before I signed
my divorce papers,

814
00:38:37,384 --> 00:38:39,821
I waited outside my house
for the adulterer.

815
00:38:39,854 --> 00:38:41,488
He never came out, so I went in.

816
00:38:42,223 --> 00:38:45,960
Kevin, let's talk
about this some other time.

817
00:38:46,661 --> 00:38:49,462
Patience.
I'm getting to the best part.

818
00:38:50,430 --> 00:38:53,034
The plan was to kill her

819
00:38:53,868 --> 00:38:55,368
and shoot myself.

820
00:38:56,469 --> 00:38:59,707
I climb on our bed,
put my hands around her neck.

821
00:39:00,508 --> 00:39:01,876
She opened her eyes.

822
00:39:02,510 --> 00:39:05,112
She doesn't scream.
She looks at me.

823
00:39:06,147 --> 00:39:07,782
I love that woman so much

824
00:39:07,815 --> 00:39:09,382
and that bitch knew it.

825
00:39:09,784 --> 00:39:12,452
She slapped my ass off and she
fucks the shit out of me.

826
00:39:13,087 --> 00:39:15,957
Oh, she didn't tell you,
did she?

827
00:39:16,389 --> 00:39:18,926
She came
so many times that night.

828
00:39:19,459 --> 00:39:21,829
She was screaming so loud...

829
00:39:25,967 --> 00:39:27,500
I had to let her bite my hand

830
00:39:27,535 --> 00:39:28,803
so she wouldn't
wake up the kids.

831
00:39:28,836 --> 00:39:30,037
You lie!

832
00:39:30,071 --> 00:39:31,839
You lie?
Is that all you got?

833
00:39:31,873 --> 00:39:33,741
Or did you
run out of fancy words?

834
00:39:33,774 --> 00:39:35,643
You want to die.
You really want to die?

835
00:39:35,676 --> 00:39:37,612
You know
why I signed my divorce papers?

836
00:39:37,645 --> 00:39:39,479
She said because,

837
00:39:39,513 --> 00:39:42,149
"Let me go
and I'll come back to you."

838
00:39:42,183 --> 00:39:43,450
Please.

839
00:39:45,786 --> 00:39:47,454
On Sunday,

840
00:39:48,055 --> 00:39:49,891
a man came to me and asked,

841
00:39:50,825 --> 00:39:52,193
"Do you want to know

842
00:39:52,226 --> 00:39:53,561
the devil's
greatest masterpiece?

843
00:39:54,896 --> 00:39:55,963
Beyond power,

844
00:39:56,731 --> 00:39:59,100
envy, lust and greed?"

845
00:40:00,167 --> 00:40:01,602
"Sure," I said.

846
00:40:02,637 --> 00:40:04,705
And he whispered,
"It's Saturday."

847
00:40:05,506 --> 00:40:06,807
"Saturday," I asked?

848
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:11,112
He said,
"It is when people kill...

849
00:40:12,947 --> 00:40:14,015
fornicate...

850
00:40:15,182 --> 00:40:18,119
and sin the most in clubs,

851
00:40:18,853 --> 00:40:21,756
parties and motels.

852
00:40:23,791 --> 00:40:25,726
They are disobeying

853
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:27,862
the fourth commandment.

854
00:40:28,162 --> 00:40:31,464
The Sabbath day
is on a Saturday,

855
00:40:31,498 --> 00:40:32,600
not Sunday."

856
00:40:33,634 --> 00:40:35,503
He was so proud of his theory.

857
00:40:36,070 --> 00:40:37,872
I didn't have
the heart to tell him

858
00:40:37,905 --> 00:40:41,208
that most suicides
happen on a Monday,

859
00:40:41,441 --> 00:40:44,211
murders on a Sunday,

860
00:40:44,245 --> 00:40:47,148
copulations on a Sunday.

861
00:40:48,582 --> 00:40:50,584
Anyway, forgive me.

862
00:40:50,818 --> 00:40:53,254
I am 32 seconds early

863
00:40:53,287 --> 00:40:55,122
and wanted to make an entrance.

864
00:40:56,157 --> 00:40:58,659
Now, I will need a dollar

865
00:40:58,693 --> 00:41:00,761
from one of you before we begin.

866
00:41:00,795 --> 00:41:01,929
Why?

867
00:41:01,963 --> 00:41:04,031
Attorney client privilege.

868
00:41:04,065 --> 00:41:06,867
So please,
correct me if I'm wrong.

869
00:41:06,901 --> 00:41:09,070
You three, fine gentlemen

870
00:41:09,103 --> 00:41:10,805
kidnapped Miss Contini,

871
00:41:10,838 --> 00:41:13,507
hoping to get
a ransom of $1,000,000.

872
00:41:13,908 --> 00:41:17,211
But, her mother
doesn't want to pay.

873
00:41:18,546 --> 00:41:19,747
With the world looking for her

874
00:41:19,780 --> 00:41:22,149
and your identities revealed,

875
00:41:22,183 --> 00:41:24,085
it has led to an animus decision

876
00:41:24,118 --> 00:41:26,220
on whether she lives or dies.

877
00:41:27,154 --> 00:41:28,689
So, is that our dilemma?

878
00:41:29,790 --> 00:41:31,258
- Yes.
- Great.

879
00:41:31,292 --> 00:41:34,161
You get the family discount.
$5,000 per hour.

880
00:41:34,195 --> 00:41:36,530
Hopefully, we should be
out of here within the hour.

881
00:41:36,564 --> 00:41:37,732
Who the hell is this guy?

882
00:41:38,032 --> 00:41:41,168
It is ill-advised
to point a gun at a man

883
00:41:41,202 --> 00:41:43,838
unless you are ready
to pull the trigger.

884
00:41:44,638 --> 00:41:46,140
He's the Prince.

885
00:41:46,173 --> 00:41:47,842
I point the gun
where I want to point it.

886
00:41:48,676 --> 00:41:50,044
The Prince.

887
00:41:50,077 --> 00:41:51,212
Thought he was
some old white dude.

888
00:41:52,713 --> 00:41:54,582
All three of you

889
00:41:54,615 --> 00:41:57,151
together get just one.

890
00:41:57,184 --> 00:41:58,519
And that was it.

891
00:41:59,587 --> 00:42:00,654
Do you understand?

892
00:42:10,331 --> 00:42:11,799
You hold on to it for now.

893
00:42:14,335 --> 00:42:15,936
Your hour has begun, gentlemen.

894
00:42:16,804 --> 00:42:18,139
I prefer cash,

895
00:42:18,606 --> 00:42:21,242
but I also accept
PayPal or Venmo

896
00:42:21,275 --> 00:42:24,178
as long as it's less
than ten grand a transaction.

897
00:42:24,712 --> 00:42:27,248
Now, you do realize
I'm not the kind of person

898
00:42:27,281 --> 00:42:29,083
you don't pay on time?

899
00:42:29,116 --> 00:42:30,184
Yes, sir.

900
00:42:30,785 --> 00:42:33,320
We were hoping
to pay you after we get the...

901
00:42:37,158 --> 00:42:39,160
Would the end
of the hour be good?

902
00:42:39,193 --> 00:42:41,662
Absolutely, George Ramos,

903
00:42:41,695 --> 00:42:43,998
Kevin Hill and Perry Washington.

904
00:42:44,598 --> 00:42:47,701
I actually need some alone time
with Miss Contini here.

905
00:42:47,735 --> 00:42:49,103
Please don't leave me alone.

906
00:42:49,136 --> 00:42:50,938
Don't be ridiculous, Isabella.

907
00:42:50,971 --> 00:42:52,673
In the words
of Leonardo da Vinci,

908
00:42:52,706 --> 00:42:54,809
"While I thought
I was learning how to live,

909
00:42:54,842 --> 00:42:56,944
I have actually been
learning how to die."

910
00:42:57,945 --> 00:43:00,081
Quick. Go out and talk.

911
00:43:00,915 --> 00:43:02,316
Don't put this shit on me.

912
00:43:02,349 --> 00:43:04,285
Not on me.
We all agreed to get him.

913
00:43:04,318 --> 00:43:05,986
Our names are in his pocket.

914
00:43:06,020 --> 00:43:07,254
The way he took the gun
was some Equalizer shit.

915
00:43:07,288 --> 00:43:08,823
He knows my last name.

916
00:43:08,856 --> 00:43:10,291
He just took the gun in my hand.

917
00:43:10,324 --> 00:43:11,959
I didn't give him any names.
No names.

918
00:43:11,992 --> 00:43:13,360
I don't know
how he knew about you two.

919
00:43:13,394 --> 00:43:15,296
Is he serious?
Five grand an hour?

920
00:43:15,329 --> 00:43:17,064
Dude took it out of my hand
before I could even blink.

921
00:43:17,098 --> 00:43:18,799
The whole five grand thing
doesn't ring true.

922
00:43:18,833 --> 00:43:20,367
Five grand is nothing
to someone like him.

923
00:43:20,401 --> 00:43:22,203
- Could be a favor to you.
- No, no, it isn't.

924
00:43:22,236 --> 00:43:24,138
He just took the gun in my hand
before I realized I had.

925
00:43:24,171 --> 00:43:25,673
Okay, enough about the gun.

926
00:43:25,706 --> 00:43:27,208
We need to focus
on the five grand.

927
00:43:27,241 --> 00:43:29,276
Nitro and I bring in 1700 each,
you bring 16.

928
00:43:29,310 --> 00:43:31,946
- Sixteen? Well...
- That's a lot of money.

929
00:43:31,979 --> 00:43:34,115
I mean, he is an attorney.
He can't be that dangerous.

930
00:43:34,148 --> 00:43:35,749
Now, you forget
the equalizer shit.

931
00:43:35,783 --> 00:43:37,251
You don't know
the Dinesh Robert story?

932
00:43:37,284 --> 00:43:39,220
- Date raped by three frat boys.
- Her father.

933
00:43:39,253 --> 00:43:41,789
Father was a council member
who wanted to run for Congress.

934
00:43:41,822 --> 00:43:43,424
Frat boys
had kingmakers for parents.

935
00:43:43,457 --> 00:43:45,126
Two billionaire
donors and a senator.

936
00:43:45,159 --> 00:43:46,694
Father shots his daughter,
shuts her up.

937
00:43:46,727 --> 00:43:48,295
Case closes.
He becomes congressman.

938
00:43:48,329 --> 00:43:49,430
Two years later,
the girl gives up

939
00:43:49,463 --> 00:43:51,232
the necessity of survival.

940
00:43:51,265 --> 00:43:52,900
- She kills herself.
- Someone hires the Prince.

941
00:43:52,933 --> 00:43:54,835
Someone hires the prince.

942
00:43:54,869 --> 00:43:56,303
First frat boy is in an asylum,

943
00:43:56,337 --> 00:43:58,105
unable to understand
a single sentence.

944
00:43:58,139 --> 00:44:00,007
Everybody thinks he smokes
the wrong kind of drugs.

945
00:44:00,040 --> 00:44:01,675
Second one,
paralyzed from the neck down.

946
00:44:01,709 --> 00:44:02,843
They said
he was drinking and driving.

947
00:44:03,744 --> 00:44:06,013
- And the last one?
- Wasn't subtle.

948
00:44:06,046 --> 00:44:07,848
Wasn't subtle.
He woke up one morning,

949
00:44:07,882 --> 00:44:10,084
one sunny morning,
and he didn't have a penis.

950
00:44:10,117 --> 00:44:12,253
- They took his dick off?
- Yup, took it off.

951
00:44:12,286 --> 00:44:15,022
Clean off.
Just stitches remain.

952
00:44:15,055 --> 00:44:16,724
How do I transfer
1,700 to your account?

953
00:44:16,757 --> 00:44:18,025
Cover me.
You know I'm good for it.

954
00:44:18,058 --> 00:44:19,126
No, you aren't.

955
00:44:19,594 --> 00:44:21,128
This is a life
and death situation.

956
00:44:21,162 --> 00:44:22,897
He will kill me if I don't pay.

957
00:44:22,930 --> 00:44:24,265
You screwed up my credit twice.

958
00:44:24,298 --> 00:44:26,300
I told you that
never, never again.

959
00:44:26,333 --> 00:44:28,202
You are so melodramatic.
Kevin, help me out.

960
00:44:28,235 --> 00:44:29,970
First, you fuck my wife,
destroy my marriage,

961
00:44:30,004 --> 00:44:31,438
architect my fall to poverty,

962
00:44:31,472 --> 00:44:33,007
then you want me
to pay your fucking bill?

963
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:34,975
I can't wait
'til he kills all of us.

964
00:44:35,009 --> 00:44:36,944
It was just a suggestion.
We're all brainstorming here.

965
00:44:36,977 --> 00:44:38,746
- But not with your credit card.
- I don't have a credit card.

966
00:44:38,779 --> 00:44:40,114
How the hell
do you know this Prince?

967
00:44:40,147 --> 00:44:42,016
He's married
to Camilla's sister.

968
00:44:42,049 --> 00:44:43,884
That's great. He's married
to your fiancée's sister?

969
00:44:43,918 --> 00:44:45,819
Tell Camilla to ask
her sister to ask her husband

970
00:44:45,853 --> 00:44:47,388
to give us some time
with the five grand.

971
00:44:47,421 --> 00:44:49,757
- No.
- What do you mean, no?

972
00:44:49,790 --> 00:44:51,859
Not telling my fiancée
that I kidnapped anyone.

973
00:44:51,892 --> 00:44:53,494
No one.

974
00:44:53,528 --> 00:44:55,029
George, unless you have
my share of the five grand,

975
00:44:55,062 --> 00:44:56,363
our lives
are as good as forfeit.

976
00:44:56,397 --> 00:44:58,232
You need to call Camilla.

977
00:44:58,265 --> 00:45:01,735
No, I won't sacrifice my chance
of happiness for this.

978
00:45:01,769 --> 00:45:03,871
You carry your own cross.
Your cross.

979
00:45:03,904 --> 00:45:06,040
If she loves you,
she'll understand.

980
00:45:06,073 --> 00:45:07,908
What do you know about love?

981
00:45:07,942 --> 00:45:09,777
You have nobody
depending on you.

982
00:45:09,810 --> 00:45:11,245
Say what you want
to say about me,

983
00:45:11,646 --> 00:45:14,315
but the problem we face is as
a trinity and it must be paid.

984
00:45:14,348 --> 00:45:16,050
Trinity. Really?

985
00:45:16,083 --> 00:45:18,852
More like the both of us,
as usual.

986
00:45:18,886 --> 00:45:19,987
It's the only logical conclusion

987
00:45:20,020 --> 00:45:21,488
at this point in time.

988
00:45:21,523 --> 00:45:22,856
- You are full of shit.
- It is what it is.

989
00:45:22,890 --> 00:45:24,391
- No, it isn't.
- Okay.

990
00:45:24,425 --> 00:45:26,060
Maybe my words
are missing their mark,

991
00:45:26,093 --> 00:45:28,028
so I'll try to be blunt.
I don't have 1600.

992
00:45:28,062 --> 00:45:29,863
Yeah, but the thing is,

993
00:45:29,897 --> 00:45:32,266
if we get only 3400,
I'm going to have

994
00:45:32,299 --> 00:45:35,135
to tell the Prince that
you don't want to pay him.

995
00:45:37,104 --> 00:45:40,941
- You realize he will kill me?
- There's only so much I can do.

996
00:45:42,042 --> 00:45:45,079
And risk Camila of finding out
about your dark dalliance?

997
00:45:45,112 --> 00:45:46,814
She wouldn't find out.

998
00:45:46,847 --> 00:45:48,382
The Prince will kill you

999
00:45:48,415 --> 00:45:49,817
and we'll make up the rest
after you're dead.

1000
00:45:50,417 --> 00:45:52,119
- You jest.
- I'm not laughing.

1001
00:45:52,853 --> 00:45:54,522
Don't sink
to his insidious level.

1002
00:45:54,556 --> 00:45:56,223
This is one tab.

1003
00:45:56,257 --> 00:45:58,225
One tab you would have
to cover your own.

1004
00:46:01,395 --> 00:46:03,531
- You're both dead to me.
- Good riddance.

1005
00:46:03,565 --> 00:46:05,899
Did I mention that I fucked
your wife in the kitchen,

1006
00:46:05,933 --> 00:46:07,968
the bedroom, the living room,
and your kids room?

1007
00:46:08,603 --> 00:46:09,903
I know what I'm going to do.

1008
00:46:10,505 --> 00:46:12,206
I'm gonna get
my share from the sweet,

1009
00:46:12,239 --> 00:46:14,509
large alimony
you gave to my Aiko.

1010
00:46:17,278 --> 00:46:19,280
How's my sweet
buttercup doing today?

1011
00:46:19,313 --> 00:46:21,081
<i>Hello, lover.</i>

1012
00:46:21,115 --> 00:46:23,150
It has been
a crazy day, my love.

1013
00:46:23,183 --> 00:46:24,818
I wish you could be
here with me.

1014
00:46:24,852 --> 00:46:26,887
- <i>Me too.</i>
- How does it feel

1015
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:29,490
to finally be free
of that quicksand of a man?

1016
00:46:29,524 --> 00:46:31,358
<i>I'm lucky to have you.</i>

1017
00:46:31,392 --> 00:46:35,229
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
No more tears, my love.

1018
00:46:35,262 --> 00:46:38,399
That dark, devouring chapter
of your life is in the past.

1019
00:46:38,432 --> 00:46:40,467
Divine happiness is our future.

1020
00:46:40,501 --> 00:46:43,070
<i>You are the best
thing to happen to me.</i>

1021
00:46:43,103 --> 00:46:45,540
My life truly began
the first time I saw you.

1022
00:46:45,573 --> 00:46:47,141
Hey, babe.

1023
00:46:47,174 --> 00:46:49,810
I need $1,600
to tidy a few things up.

1024
00:46:55,416 --> 00:46:58,085
Hello?
Aiko, are you still there?

1025
00:46:58,118 --> 00:47:00,354
<i>Yes. I got distracted.</i>

1026
00:47:03,223 --> 00:47:05,192
- So?
<i>- So.</i>

1027
00:47:07,061 --> 00:47:08,295
The 1600.

1028
00:47:10,164 --> 00:47:12,567
I promise to pay it back
by the end of the month.

1029
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,001
<i>Where the heck am I going to</i>

1030
00:47:14,034 --> 00:47:15,537
<i>get that kind of money?</i>

1031
00:47:15,570 --> 00:47:18,105
You just got a $73,000
lump alimony settlement.

1032
00:47:18,138 --> 00:47:20,007
I'm not asking for much.

1033
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:21,576
<i>I'm a single mother
with two children.</i>

1034
00:47:21,609 --> 00:47:23,277
<i>- I can't start off wasting.</i>
- Wasting?

1035
00:47:27,247 --> 00:47:31,952
Aiko, I'm coming to you
because you are my heart.

1036
00:47:33,087 --> 00:47:34,622
<i>Hello? Hello?</i>

1037
00:47:34,656 --> 00:47:36,256
<i>P... Perry,
I can't seem to hear you.</i>

1038
00:47:36,290 --> 00:47:38,292
I can hear you fine.

1039
00:47:38,325 --> 00:47:40,562
<i>This signal seems bad.
I'll get back to you.</i>

1040
00:47:40,595 --> 00:47:43,430
Aiko, I...

1041
00:47:48,202 --> 00:47:50,904
It's probably the signal.

1042
00:47:53,006 --> 00:47:55,342
Wow. I swear
I didn't see that coming.

1043
00:47:55,376 --> 00:47:56,578
This is getting very depressing.

1044
00:47:56,611 --> 00:47:58,112
Very depressing.

1045
00:47:58,145 --> 00:48:00,314
For the love of anything holy,

1046
00:48:00,347 --> 00:48:03,016
- please don't call her back...
- I'm not calling his wife.

1047
00:48:03,050 --> 00:48:04,586
Wait, wait, wait. Ex-wife.

1048
00:48:06,186 --> 00:48:08,155
So, who are you calling?

1049
00:48:08,188 --> 00:48:11,191
None of your fucking business,
you pathetic quisling.

1050
00:48:12,092 --> 00:48:15,396
Feel free to ask me anything.

1051
00:48:22,537 --> 00:48:23,937
Are you a Prince?

1052
00:48:26,974 --> 00:48:28,075
No.

1053
00:48:28,743 --> 00:48:32,446
I was a Nigerian with an accent
in an American college

1054
00:48:32,479 --> 00:48:36,316
at a time when fraudulent
emails from a number of people

1055
00:48:36,350 --> 00:48:39,953
claiming to be Nigerian princes
were asking for money.

1056
00:48:40,588 --> 00:48:41,689
Okay.

1057
00:48:43,056 --> 00:48:45,292
- Any more questions?
- Yeah.

1058
00:48:47,562 --> 00:48:49,196
Are they going to kill me?

1059
00:48:49,229 --> 00:48:50,698
No.

1060
00:48:50,732 --> 00:48:52,466
Everyone thinks they can
kill another human being

1061
00:48:52,499 --> 00:48:55,035
until the reality
of taking one's life

1062
00:48:55,068 --> 00:48:57,037
is a split second away.

1063
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:58,238
They don't have it in them.

1064
00:48:58,606 --> 00:49:01,408
- Do you have it in you?
- You do.

1065
00:49:01,442 --> 00:49:03,944
Me? Kill someone?

1066
00:49:05,379 --> 00:49:07,615
Anyone? No.

1067
00:49:08,382 --> 00:49:09,450
And you?

1068
00:49:11,185 --> 00:49:12,486
It's like sex.

1069
00:49:13,020 --> 00:49:15,355
As a virgin,
you have a lot to protect.

1070
00:49:15,389 --> 00:49:17,725
Once you've been deflowered,
it gets easier.

1071
00:49:20,762 --> 00:49:22,362
Are you going to kill me?

1072
00:49:24,131 --> 00:49:27,702
Everything I say
might be the truth or a lie.

1073
00:49:28,135 --> 00:49:31,606
The goal is to get a deal
everyone can be happy with.

1074
00:49:33,407 --> 00:49:35,108
Look at it on the bright side.

1075
00:49:35,543 --> 00:49:38,278
There is a strong chance
you get to leave here

1076
00:49:38,312 --> 00:49:40,715
back to your
three bedroom condo.

1077
00:49:40,748 --> 00:49:42,483
You know where I live?

1078
00:49:46,086 --> 00:49:47,589
In five minutes,

1079
00:49:47,622 --> 00:49:50,157
a kid in his pajamas
typed his keyboard.

1080
00:49:50,190 --> 00:49:52,092
I got
your Social Security number,

1081
00:49:52,359 --> 00:49:54,094
your pharmacist,

1082
00:49:54,127 --> 00:49:56,363
where your mother
has your money stashed up

1083
00:49:56,396 --> 00:49:58,131
and your STD results.

1084
00:49:59,767 --> 00:50:01,134
What?

1085
00:50:02,537 --> 00:50:03,671
How?

1086
00:50:04,238 --> 00:50:07,007
- It's okay.
- How?

1087
00:50:07,575 --> 00:50:09,109
I know about everyone.

1088
00:50:09,544 --> 00:50:12,112
Information is the new oil.

1089
00:50:12,547 --> 00:50:14,481
My STD result?

1090
00:50:15,048 --> 00:50:18,352
Oral herpes.
Nothing to be ashamed of.

1091
00:50:18,385 --> 00:50:21,421
50 to 80%
of American adults have it.

1092
00:50:26,426 --> 00:50:28,061
Your friends call you Bella.

1093
00:50:29,162 --> 00:50:31,198
- May I call you that?
- No.

1094
00:50:33,100 --> 00:50:34,669
My wife has only one rule.

1095
00:50:35,135 --> 00:50:37,271
As long as
we're in the same zip code,

1096
00:50:37,304 --> 00:50:38,706
we have dinner together.

1097
00:50:39,106 --> 00:50:43,043
So, if I don't leave here early,
she'll be waiting out for me.

1098
00:50:43,343 --> 00:50:45,312
And I don't want
her waiting out for me.

1099
00:50:49,617 --> 00:50:51,451
What do you want me to agree to?

1100
00:50:51,753 --> 00:50:55,523
I don't want you to agree
to everything I propose.

1101
00:50:55,823 --> 00:50:57,625
I want to make you happy.

1102
00:50:58,058 --> 00:51:01,261
Happy? I'm tied to a chair.

1103
00:51:01,295 --> 00:51:04,364
In front of me is an assassin
with two loaded weapons.

1104
00:51:04,398 --> 00:51:07,167
I will agree
to anything you tell me.

1105
00:51:07,635 --> 00:51:09,269
I am not an assassin.

1106
00:51:10,070 --> 00:51:13,273
You just kill people if
they don't agree with you 100%.

1107
00:51:13,307 --> 00:51:15,643
Why can't I get my
mouth to shut up?

1108
00:51:15,677 --> 00:51:17,177
Am I trying to kill myself?

1109
00:51:17,210 --> 00:51:18,445
I'm a businessman

1110
00:51:19,514 --> 00:51:21,248
and an officer of the court.

1111
00:51:24,351 --> 00:51:27,220
I don't kill people.
I am positive

1112
00:51:27,254 --> 00:51:29,189
you walk out
of here with a smile.

1113
00:51:31,826 --> 00:51:34,629
Yeah, right.

1114
00:51:35,228 --> 00:51:38,332
He wants me to run so
he could shoot me in the back.

1115
00:51:39,299 --> 00:51:41,201
I'm sitting my butt here.

1116
00:51:42,302 --> 00:51:44,872
I don't want you thinking I'm
going to shoot you in the back.

1117
00:51:45,773 --> 00:51:48,408
Is this psychopath
reading my thoughts?

1118
00:51:49,176 --> 00:51:50,243
So...

1119
00:51:51,478 --> 00:51:52,880
The million dollar question.

1120
00:51:54,381 --> 00:51:56,483
How do we get you
to walk out of here,

1121
00:51:56,517 --> 00:51:58,352
pay $1,000,000
to your kidnappers

1122
00:51:58,385 --> 00:52:00,120
with a smile on your face?

1123
00:52:02,957 --> 00:52:05,492
So how?

1124
00:52:05,526 --> 00:52:06,894
Okay, good.

1125
00:52:07,260 --> 00:52:09,631
Hopefully we're over me
being a psychopath.

1126
00:52:09,664 --> 00:52:11,331
Am I going crazy?

1127
00:52:11,966 --> 00:52:13,835
I mean I'm still
detoxing or something.

1128
00:52:14,535 --> 00:52:15,603
Honestly.

1129
00:52:17,304 --> 00:52:18,840
Who the fuck am I talking to?

1130
00:52:18,873 --> 00:52:20,440
Is someone out there?

1131
00:52:22,142 --> 00:52:24,579
There are three
factions to this.

1132
00:52:24,612 --> 00:52:28,215
First, getting
$1,000,000 from you,

1133
00:52:28,650 --> 00:52:30,652
paying off
your inexperienced kidnappers,

1134
00:52:30,685 --> 00:52:34,321
and lastly, making that million
worth ten times more for you.

1135
00:52:34,822 --> 00:52:37,224
If they're paying you
five grand,

1136
00:52:38,458 --> 00:52:40,561
what stops you
from just killing us all

1137
00:52:40,595 --> 00:52:41,929
and taking the million?

1138
00:52:41,963 --> 00:52:43,531
I got to where I am

1139
00:52:43,564 --> 00:52:45,499
because my name
comes with integrity.

1140
00:52:45,533 --> 00:52:47,969
If I stifled anyone, I'll be
out of his business in a month.

1141
00:52:48,002 --> 00:52:51,506
Also, I am in a 1% tax bracket.

1142
00:52:51,539 --> 00:52:53,608
And you get paid
five grand an hour.

1143
00:52:54,241 --> 00:52:55,877
Actually, I get 10%,

1144
00:52:55,910 --> 00:52:57,578
a sort of five grand thing
to get him out.

1145
00:52:57,612 --> 00:52:59,446
I wanted to be
here alone with you.

1146
00:53:00,615 --> 00:53:01,816
Why?

1147
00:53:02,482 --> 00:53:04,484
We'll get to that.

1148
00:53:04,519 --> 00:53:09,724
So, how do we get $1,000,000
in the next 30 minutes?

1149
00:53:11,324 --> 00:53:13,260
I can give you
the million dollars.

1150
00:53:14,629 --> 00:53:15,730
A million?

1151
00:53:16,798 --> 00:53:18,498
You have no idea
the kind of shit

1152
00:53:18,533 --> 00:53:19,867
I've done to remain relevant.

1153
00:53:21,569 --> 00:53:23,938
Well, I'm not interested
in having sex with you

1154
00:53:23,971 --> 00:53:25,506
for $1,000,000.

1155
00:53:26,306 --> 00:53:27,508
Yes, I know.

1156
00:53:28,009 --> 00:53:29,711
One can tell when a man
wants to fuck her.

1157
00:53:29,744 --> 00:53:30,945
What do you want?

1158
00:53:30,978 --> 00:53:33,548
25% interest in three months.

1159
00:53:33,581 --> 00:53:35,215
How are you sure
I'd pay it back?

1160
00:53:36,551 --> 00:53:39,721
In 10 minutes,
I found out your address.

1161
00:53:40,521 --> 00:53:41,823
You have herpes.

1162
00:53:42,156 --> 00:53:44,257
You have a hidden account
in the Cayman Islands.

1163
00:53:44,291 --> 00:53:47,260
As long as you're alive,
I'll get my money back on time.

1164
00:53:47,294 --> 00:53:51,799
Okay. If we can just
stop talking about herpes.

1165
00:53:52,700 --> 00:53:54,001
I can transfer the money.

1166
00:53:55,937 --> 00:53:57,605
Your mother closed your account.

1167
00:53:59,707 --> 00:54:00,942
I don't understand.

1168
00:54:01,142 --> 00:54:03,878
She cleared it up.
Even better.

1169
00:54:03,911 --> 00:54:06,547
She's misdirecting
the cops of your missing story.

1170
00:54:06,581 --> 00:54:09,449
That's why the cops
aren't looking for kidnappers.

1171
00:54:13,821 --> 00:54:15,790
I'm her own flesh and blood.

1172
00:54:19,861 --> 00:54:21,361
Once you're sat at the top,

1173
00:54:21,394 --> 00:54:22,530
you do anything
to get back there.

1174
00:54:22,563 --> 00:54:23,965
She's on the news.

1175
00:54:23,998 --> 00:54:25,700
You're niche.
She's mainstream now.

1176
00:54:29,737 --> 00:54:32,874
You know, I still remember
her face when I won the Oscar.

1177
00:54:34,108 --> 00:54:35,576
12 year old prodigy.

1178
00:54:37,879 --> 00:54:39,346
She hated me for it.

1179
00:54:41,582 --> 00:54:43,518
We worked on
that picture together.

1180
00:54:44,218 --> 00:54:46,654
It was supposed to be
her big comeback.

1181
00:54:49,023 --> 00:54:50,858
Instead, I won.

1182
00:54:51,826 --> 00:54:53,326
Do you have the money or not?

1183
00:54:53,360 --> 00:54:55,428
I owe the IRS 15 million.

1184
00:54:55,462 --> 00:54:56,798
That's why I was
stashing everything away

1185
00:54:56,831 --> 00:54:58,032
in the Cayman Islands.

1186
00:54:58,065 --> 00:54:59,934
My wife's dinner
is getting cold.

1187
00:54:59,967 --> 00:55:01,736
You need to make a decision.

1188
00:55:01,769 --> 00:55:03,538
- I don't have the money.
- I offered you the money.

1189
00:55:05,106 --> 00:55:07,074
How would I ever pay you back?

1190
00:55:07,108 --> 00:55:09,076
You'd be in a better place
by the end of our meeting.

1191
00:55:09,110 --> 00:55:10,443
No.

1192
00:55:11,078 --> 00:55:13,648
I can't agree to something
I don't understand.

1193
00:55:16,818 --> 00:55:20,487
What differentiates
a great actor from a good actor?

1194
00:55:21,956 --> 00:55:24,625
Human beings start acting
immediately they're born,

1195
00:55:24,659 --> 00:55:28,428
but a great actor
makes you believe every word

1196
00:55:28,461 --> 00:55:30,097
that comes out of their mouth.

1197
00:55:30,131 --> 00:55:32,600
When a great actor tells you
the aliens are coming,

1198
00:55:32,633 --> 00:55:34,334
you believe
the aliens are coming.

1199
00:55:34,902 --> 00:55:36,537
Is he teaching me about acting?

1200
00:55:36,571 --> 00:55:39,006
The second youngest
Oscar winner ever?

1201
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:40,975
Bear with me.

1202
00:55:41,008 --> 00:55:45,012
The problem is you didn't
make us believe in your words.

1203
00:55:45,046 --> 00:55:48,448
You didn't lock us in
with your words.

1204
00:55:48,481 --> 00:55:51,152
Great. What do I know
about acting with words?

1205
00:55:51,185 --> 00:55:53,020
That you were not
where you were supposed to be.

1206
00:55:53,054 --> 00:55:57,692
You were too busy
going for pop movies.

1207
00:55:57,725 --> 00:56:00,061
I won an Oscar
for the <i>Lost Sunset.</i>

1208
00:56:00,094 --> 00:56:01,963
You were a 12 year old

1209
00:56:01,996 --> 00:56:04,165
singing and acting
the same year your father died,

1210
00:56:04,198 --> 00:56:08,102
with a mother everyone knew
was at the end of her twilight.

1211
00:56:08,135 --> 00:56:10,872
Even Kermit the Frog
would have gotten an Oscar

1212
00:56:10,905 --> 00:56:12,139
under the same circumstance.

1213
00:56:12,173 --> 00:56:13,975
I worked hard for that Oscar.

1214
00:56:14,008 --> 00:56:15,408
I deserved it!

1215
00:56:15,442 --> 00:56:16,777
Deserved it?

1216
00:56:16,811 --> 00:56:19,180
Deserving is Peter O'Toole,

1217
00:56:19,213 --> 00:56:22,016
Glenn Close, Angela Bassett,

1218
00:56:22,049 --> 00:56:23,651
- And indeed...
- You know what?

1219
00:56:23,684 --> 00:56:25,519
I don't come to
your place of work

1220
00:56:25,553 --> 00:56:27,655
and tell you that you killed
someone the wrong way.

1221
00:56:27,688 --> 00:56:30,858
- Edward Norton. Tom Cruise.
- That's bullshit.

1222
00:56:33,928 --> 00:56:35,963
My job is not to kill people.

1223
00:56:36,697 --> 00:56:41,102
Your job is to entertain
your audience with your movies.

1224
00:56:41,468 --> 00:56:45,539
If I paid 14 bucks
to watch your movies,

1225
00:56:45,573 --> 00:56:48,776
I have every right
to criticize it.

1226
00:56:48,809 --> 00:56:51,846
- Then don't watch my movie.
- That's the problem!

1227
00:56:52,280 --> 00:56:53,948
Nobody watches them anymore.

1228
00:56:53,981 --> 00:56:55,883
I don't need you to watch them.

1229
00:56:57,084 --> 00:56:58,853
<i>We Bleed Red.</i>

1230
00:57:01,789 --> 00:57:03,624
So, you do watch my movies.

1231
00:57:04,392 --> 00:57:06,027
I didn't watch it
because of you.

1232
00:57:06,394 --> 00:57:10,231
But the 10 minutes
you were in it,

1233
00:57:10,264 --> 00:57:13,134
is the reason
I'm here right now.

1234
00:57:20,875 --> 00:57:22,176
Walk with me.

1235
00:57:24,645 --> 00:57:26,013
This is the part
where you tell me

1236
00:57:26,047 --> 00:57:27,715
where I fit into
your stupid story.

1237
00:57:28,182 --> 00:57:29,984
I go to a Hollywood party

1238
00:57:30,017 --> 00:57:32,720
and Zhang Hyang harasses me
to read this script,

1239
00:57:32,753 --> 00:57:33,921
<i>Queens of the Revolution.</i>

1240
00:57:34,355 --> 00:57:35,856
You know Zhang Hyang?

1241
00:57:35,890 --> 00:57:37,892
Yes, I invested in <i>We Bleed Red.</i>

1242
00:57:38,626 --> 00:57:41,195
I was in it.
You funded my movie.

1243
00:57:41,529 --> 00:57:44,632
Your movie?
Let's not push liberties.

1244
00:57:44,665 --> 00:57:46,834
You weren't
in the top 50 billing.

1245
00:57:46,867 --> 00:57:48,970
- It was a team effort.
- Sure.

1246
00:57:49,003 --> 00:57:50,638
Keep telling yourself that.

1247
00:57:50,671 --> 00:57:52,707
I didn't see
your name in the billing.

1248
00:57:52,740 --> 00:57:54,575
Because it wasn't there.

1249
00:57:54,608 --> 00:57:56,911
Anyway, I read a script
and immediately I'm thinking,

1250
00:57:56,944 --> 00:58:00,581
"Danai Gurira,
Tika Sumpter or Yvonne Orji?"

1251
00:58:00,614 --> 00:58:02,083
Yes, the lead actress is Black.

1252
00:58:02,116 --> 00:58:03,751
Of course, she isn't.

1253
00:58:03,784 --> 00:58:06,187
But you just named
all Black actresses.

1254
00:58:06,220 --> 00:58:07,955
It was
my 10 million on the line.

1255
00:58:07,989 --> 00:58:09,523
I was picking who I wanted.

1256
00:58:09,957 --> 00:58:13,027
- Really? Ten million?
- Can I finish my story?

1257
00:58:13,060 --> 00:58:14,528
Yeah, sorry.

1258
00:58:14,562 --> 00:58:17,131
Then I got a call from Zhang

1259
00:58:17,465 --> 00:58:19,767
that he's met
with Chiwetel Ejiofor,

1260
00:58:19,800 --> 00:58:21,602
and he wants him
to play the lead role.

1261
00:58:22,136 --> 00:58:25,072
The studio feels two Black
leads make it a Black movie.

1262
00:58:25,106 --> 00:58:27,108
- I kind of see their point.
- Of course you do.

1263
00:58:27,141 --> 00:58:29,643
Anyway, then I get
a call you're here,

1264
00:58:29,677 --> 00:58:32,613
I push your name with Zhang
and he likes the idea.

1265
00:58:35,649 --> 00:58:39,020
- For... for what role?
- Jeno Shion, the lead.

1266
00:58:41,222 --> 00:58:42,790
- The lead?
- Yeah.

1267
00:58:44,158 --> 00:58:45,259
Why?

1268
00:58:46,160 --> 00:58:47,728
I'm not shitting on this.

1269
00:58:48,262 --> 00:58:52,133
I will do a porn if... if
Zhang was directing it, but...

1270
00:58:55,036 --> 00:58:56,637
this can't be real.

1271
00:58:56,670 --> 00:58:58,739
It is. It is very real.

1272
00:59:00,207 --> 00:59:02,109
I thought that
Zhang didn't notice me.

1273
00:59:02,143 --> 00:59:04,245
I mean, he directed it.

1274
00:59:04,278 --> 00:59:06,981
But why would he remember me?

1275
00:59:07,381 --> 00:59:09,750
Why would anyone want me?
I'm a has been.

1276
00:59:10,184 --> 00:59:13,621
Both he and I were
blown away by your ten minutes.

1277
00:59:13,654 --> 00:59:16,123
It was raw. It was real.

1278
00:59:16,157 --> 00:59:18,692
And most importantly,
you are trending.

1279
00:59:20,061 --> 00:59:23,230
- Trending. I'm trending.
- Mm hmm.

1280
00:59:23,264 --> 00:59:26,901
You're on every news channel,
foreign and abroad.

1281
00:59:26,934 --> 00:59:29,570
You can't buy
that kind of publicity.

1282
00:59:30,671 --> 00:59:32,640
The role is yours
if you want it.

1283
00:59:32,673 --> 00:59:36,677
Okay. Yeah. Yeah...

1284
00:59:36,710 --> 00:59:38,879
But I have to ask, the drugs?

1285
00:59:38,913 --> 00:59:40,714
- Zhang's old school.
- Oh, it's just uppers.

1286
00:59:40,748 --> 00:59:42,016
It won't affect my work.

1287
00:59:43,150 --> 00:59:46,120
- You were binging on coke.
- I've crashed since then.

1288
00:59:46,153 --> 00:59:49,890
13 days tied up here,
puking, sleeping,

1289
00:59:50,324 --> 00:59:52,693
those punks have done
what no rehab facility

1290
00:59:52,726 --> 00:59:53,894
has been able to do.

1291
00:59:53,928 --> 00:59:55,296
I'm clean.

1292
00:59:55,329 --> 00:59:56,730
It seems like
a perfect day then.

1293
00:59:58,699 --> 00:59:59,800
And the million?

1294
01:00:00,167 --> 01:00:02,069
That can wait
'til after you get paid.

1295
01:00:03,437 --> 01:00:05,806
They're going to pay me
a lot more than a million.

1296
01:00:06,373 --> 01:00:08,642
Holy shit, I'd do this for free.

1297
01:00:09,511 --> 01:00:12,179
Isabella Contini,
you're the it girl now.

1298
01:00:12,213 --> 01:00:14,849
Those three men out there
have done for you

1299
01:00:14,882 --> 01:00:16,317
what people would kill for.

1300
01:00:17,151 --> 01:00:18,219
Huh?

1301
01:00:18,853 --> 01:00:21,055
Before I received this call,
I could have sworn

1302
01:00:21,088 --> 01:00:22,756
you planned the whole thing.

1303
01:00:22,790 --> 01:00:24,358
And I applauded it
as a master comeback.

1304
01:00:25,259 --> 01:00:26,894
The world is in your cage,

1305
01:00:26,927 --> 01:00:30,097
own it or it will
come back to devour you.

1306
01:00:32,867 --> 01:00:35,035
Never a victim.
Nobody worships the victim.

1307
01:00:35,069 --> 01:00:36,370
You are the goddess right now.

1308
01:00:37,972 --> 01:00:39,807
How do I explain all of this?

1309
01:00:40,107 --> 01:00:42,776
That's the best part.
You don't.

1310
01:00:42,810 --> 01:00:45,146
- I don't?
- You walk out of here.

1311
01:00:45,179 --> 01:00:46,981
We drop you with
a hood over your head

1312
01:00:47,014 --> 01:00:48,382
close to the police station.

1313
01:00:48,415 --> 01:00:50,084
You walk in face bloodied.

1314
01:00:50,451 --> 01:00:52,820
Don't tell them
anything about this.

1315
01:00:52,853 --> 01:00:54,688
I refuse to say anything.

1316
01:00:54,722 --> 01:00:56,857
It will be remembered
for years to come

1317
01:00:56,891 --> 01:00:58,926
as a trauma you refuse to share.

1318
01:00:58,959 --> 01:01:01,762
- Not even with a shrink.
- So, I'm selling a mystery.

1319
01:01:02,196 --> 01:01:03,430
Make the world wonder,

1320
01:01:03,464 --> 01:01:06,033
"Was she beaten,
raped, tortured?

1321
01:01:06,066 --> 01:01:07,902
Did they kill
any other part of her?"

1322
01:01:07,935 --> 01:01:10,171
You will be the hot cheerleader.

1323
01:01:10,204 --> 01:01:12,406
Everyone will want to
get into your panties.

1324
01:01:14,008 --> 01:01:15,743
And talk shows.

1325
01:01:15,776 --> 01:01:18,946
Tell Ellen everything
except what happened.

1326
01:01:18,979 --> 01:01:20,948
I've always
wanted to be on Ellen.

1327
01:01:20,981 --> 01:01:22,783
She will beg for an exclusive.

1328
01:01:22,816 --> 01:01:25,052
The cops, they might
want to involve the feds.

1329
01:01:25,085 --> 01:01:27,388
You're not obligated
to tell them anything.

1330
01:01:27,888 --> 01:01:31,759
As long as you don't lie,
you haven't committed a crime.

1331
01:01:31,792 --> 01:01:33,294
They're going to
want to run a rape kit.

1332
01:01:33,628 --> 01:01:35,196
Let them know
it's too traumatic.

1333
01:01:35,229 --> 01:01:36,430
You don't want
anyone touching you.

1334
01:01:36,463 --> 01:01:37,998
You want to go home, shower,

1335
01:01:38,032 --> 01:01:39,333
burn your clothes,
and go to bed.

1336
01:01:39,700 --> 01:01:42,036
My face, my body.

1337
01:01:42,069 --> 01:01:44,071
These fuckers
didn't leave a scratch on me.

1338
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:48,042
We'll get one of them
to do a touch up job on you.

1339
01:01:48,577 --> 01:01:50,911
I doubt these pussies
could even kill a spider.

1340
01:01:52,213 --> 01:01:53,914
You're going to have to do it.

1341
01:01:55,216 --> 01:01:56,283
Follow me.

1342
01:02:01,855 --> 01:02:03,490
Screw you!

1343
01:02:07,428 --> 01:02:09,230
Mommy didn't give you any money?

1344
01:02:09,263 --> 01:02:10,497
Okay.

1345
01:02:11,566 --> 01:02:13,300
Whoa! What are you doing?

1346
01:02:13,334 --> 01:02:15,936
All right, Musketeers,
no more mommy banter,

1347
01:02:15,970 --> 01:02:17,771
no more loser jokes.

1348
01:02:17,805 --> 01:02:19,507
I was your brother.
I had your back for decades.

1349
01:02:19,541 --> 01:02:21,809
Not months, not years. Decades.

1350
01:02:21,842 --> 01:02:24,411
What did I ask for?
A measly $1600.

1351
01:02:24,445 --> 01:02:28,115
Then you humiliate me
over 1600 dollars!

1352
01:02:28,148 --> 01:02:29,950
Brothers don't screw
each other's wives.

1353
01:02:29,984 --> 01:02:31,986
- That is beside the point.
- That is the point.

1354
01:02:32,019 --> 01:02:33,988
I have the gun in my hand,
so shut up and listen.

1355
01:02:34,021 --> 01:02:36,357
I need the two of you
to lend me $1600.

1356
01:02:36,390 --> 01:02:39,059
I'd rather die from your bullet
than lend you a dollar.

1357
01:02:39,093 --> 01:02:40,961
You're still emotional,
so I'm going to

1358
01:02:40,995 --> 01:02:42,997
- give you time to cool off.
- No, no.

1359
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:45,533
- What do you mean, no?
- You still owe me.

1360
01:02:46,000 --> 01:02:48,002
I have the gun in my hands.

1361
01:02:48,035 --> 01:02:50,304
- Oh, is this a robbery?
- It's a negotiation.

1362
01:02:50,337 --> 01:02:52,507
- With the gun in your hand?
- The Prince will kill me

1363
01:02:52,540 --> 01:02:54,341
if I don't give him the money.

1364
01:02:54,375 --> 01:02:56,910
It's about the principle.
The principle.

1365
01:02:56,944 --> 01:02:59,913
You asked me to co-sign
for your rent and car.

1366
01:02:59,947 --> 01:03:03,183
I did. Now, I find myself
paying for both.

1367
01:03:03,217 --> 01:03:06,153
This is different, George.
It's my life on the line.

1368
01:03:06,186 --> 01:03:08,523
It's about the principle,
Perry, the principle.

1369
01:03:08,556 --> 01:03:10,858
You came to me
in debt up to your eyeballs

1370
01:03:10,891 --> 01:03:13,260
and asked me for
my help with the abduction.

1371
01:03:13,294 --> 01:03:15,229
I didn't blink
an eye to abet you.

1372
01:03:15,262 --> 01:03:17,298
That's a load of shit.
A load of shit.

1373
01:03:17,331 --> 01:03:19,500
You're here because
of a third of $1,000,000.

1374
01:03:19,534 --> 01:03:21,068
We were supposed to be brothers.

1375
01:03:21,101 --> 01:03:22,537
You aren't my brother!

1376
01:03:22,570 --> 01:03:24,506
You've always been
a vile human being to me

1377
01:03:24,539 --> 01:03:26,106
and to your ex-wife.

1378
01:03:26,140 --> 01:03:28,208
I'm happy that
justifies what you did.

1379
01:03:28,242 --> 01:03:30,177
Poor Aiko.

1380
01:03:30,210 --> 01:03:32,279
She had to deal with your
bitching about your work hours

1381
01:03:32,313 --> 01:03:34,214
while she slaved away
for your children.

1382
01:03:34,248 --> 01:03:36,116
- Don't mention my children.
- You want know the truth?

1383
01:03:36,150 --> 01:03:38,452
I'm a better father
to your children.

1384
01:03:38,485 --> 01:03:41,121
Hear my words clearly.
You and I are done!

1385
01:03:41,155 --> 01:03:43,157
We were done the minute
you kicked me off your mansion.

1386
01:03:43,190 --> 01:03:45,926
Fuck you.
Fuck both of you.

1387
01:03:46,360 --> 01:03:48,530
- Yeah.
- Right, blame us all

1388
01:03:48,563 --> 01:03:50,532
for your inability
to handle the truth.

1389
01:03:50,565 --> 01:03:53,033
The truth?
I'll call Camila right now

1390
01:03:53,067 --> 01:03:55,102
and let her know that
you're nothing but a miscreant.

1391
01:03:55,135 --> 01:03:58,105
Kidnapping poor,
innocent girls from the street.

1392
01:03:58,138 --> 01:04:00,074
- What are you waiting for?
- George, no!

1393
01:04:00,107 --> 01:04:02,409
No, no.
He will call Camila now.

1394
01:04:02,443 --> 01:04:04,411
He will tell
my fiancée the truth.

1395
01:04:04,445 --> 01:04:06,413
You know I can't call.
I smashed my phone.

1396
01:04:10,317 --> 01:04:12,920
This whole plan
reeks of sabotage.

1397
01:04:13,320 --> 01:04:15,657
How the hell did the Prince
get here in ten minutes?

1398
01:04:15,690 --> 01:04:17,257
We're in the middle of nowhere.

1399
01:04:20,227 --> 01:04:22,196
You both think
you're so special.

1400
01:04:22,764 --> 01:04:24,532
You're nothing in this world.

1401
01:04:24,566 --> 01:04:26,467
You'll be forgotten
in less than a generation.

1402
01:04:27,468 --> 01:04:30,037
Screw both of you.

1403
01:04:45,653 --> 01:04:47,054
I need to talk to you.

1404
01:04:51,559 --> 01:04:54,529
It is ill advised
to point a gun at a man,

1405
01:04:54,562 --> 01:04:57,532
unless you are
ready to pull the...

1406
01:04:57,565 --> 01:05:00,000
You will listen as I speak.

1407
01:05:01,034 --> 01:05:03,003
Or what?

1408
01:05:03,036 --> 01:05:04,506
You know, everyone needs
to stop messing with me.

1409
01:05:04,539 --> 01:05:06,340
I will shoot
the gun if I have to.

1410
01:05:06,373 --> 01:05:09,076
- Drop the gun, you fool.
- Who are you calling a fool?

1411
01:05:10,244 --> 01:05:12,514
Point the gun back at me.

1412
01:05:14,616 --> 01:05:17,519
You will let me pay
my 1600 in a month's time.

1413
01:05:19,286 --> 01:05:21,021
Are you telling me
or are you asking me?

1414
01:05:21,054 --> 01:05:22,990
Actually,
two months, motherfucker.

1415
01:05:24,391 --> 01:05:25,560
Don't pick up the fucking phone.

1416
01:05:26,694 --> 01:05:28,530
Yeah, mmm-hmm, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1417
01:05:28,563 --> 01:05:30,565
Here with her now.
Talking with her.

1418
01:05:31,465 --> 01:05:34,536
Yeah. Mmm hmm. Yeah.
Talking with her now.

1419
01:05:34,569 --> 01:05:38,138
- It's looking good.
- Hang up the fucking phone.

1420
01:05:38,172 --> 01:05:39,607
Yeah. Let me confirm.

1421
01:05:39,641 --> 01:05:42,075
Your agent's
Will Shorsky, right? Okay.

1422
01:05:42,109 --> 01:05:44,612
- Send a document.
- You will respect me.

1423
01:05:44,646 --> 01:05:46,614
You fucking nigger.

1424
01:05:48,048 --> 01:05:49,483
Let me call you back.

1425
01:05:55,122 --> 01:05:57,191
You now have
my undivided attention.

1426
01:05:57,224 --> 01:05:58,425
Stay where you are.

1427
01:06:00,728 --> 01:06:03,497
In the year 1640,

1428
01:06:03,531 --> 01:06:06,333
three indentured servants

1429
01:06:06,901 --> 01:06:09,269
try and escape their employers.

1430
01:06:09,671 --> 01:06:11,071
They get caught.

1431
01:06:11,506 --> 01:06:14,241
The judge listens
to the case from all three men

1432
01:06:14,274 --> 01:06:19,279
and sentences
only one, John Punch,

1433
01:06:19,313 --> 01:06:22,584
the Black one,
to a life of servitude

1434
01:06:22,617 --> 01:06:25,419
to the Virginia planter,
Hugh Gwynn

1435
01:06:25,452 --> 01:06:28,121
for the rest of his life.

1436
01:06:28,556 --> 01:06:33,393
That is how racism
became legal in America.

1437
01:06:34,061 --> 01:06:36,363
Just by a judge looking at a man

1438
01:06:36,396 --> 01:06:39,233
who didn't look like him
and sentenced him.

1439
01:06:39,266 --> 01:06:40,668
I'm warning you to stop.

1440
01:06:41,034 --> 01:06:43,136
Most people would say,

1441
01:06:43,170 --> 01:06:46,440
the white man
who shouts "nigger,"

1442
01:06:46,473 --> 01:06:48,342
is the biggest racist.

1443
01:06:48,375 --> 01:06:51,011
But now, I happen to like
the way of the alt right.

1444
01:06:51,245 --> 01:06:53,681
They don't like me.
They don't like my children.

1445
01:06:53,715 --> 01:06:55,583
They don't like my progress.

1446
01:06:55,617 --> 01:06:57,719
And they don't hide behind
the etiquette of society.

1447
01:06:57,752 --> 01:06:59,419
Don't fucking come any closer.

1448
01:06:59,453 --> 01:07:03,490
Now, the enemies
the Black man needs to fear

1449
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:06,393
are the ones
with smiles on their faces

1450
01:07:06,426 --> 01:07:10,097
who see the progress
of the war on their throne.

1451
01:07:10,130 --> 01:07:12,534
I swear I will shoot you
if you come any closer.

1452
01:07:12,567 --> 01:07:15,135
They are quick
to try to make us forget

1453
01:07:15,603 --> 01:07:17,605
that Henry Boyd created the bed.

1454
01:07:17,639 --> 01:07:19,607
Stay the fuck back.

1455
01:07:19,641 --> 01:07:23,611
Garrett Morgan created the gas
mask and the traffic lights.

1456
01:07:23,645 --> 01:07:26,179
Charles Drew, the blood bank.

1457
01:07:26,614 --> 01:07:29,784
Alice Parker,
the gas heating furnace.

1458
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:33,453
Mary Davidson,
the sanitary belt.

1459
01:07:33,487 --> 01:07:36,691
Philip Emeagwali,
the supercomputer.

1460
01:07:36,724 --> 01:07:38,560
For the last time,
stay the fuck away from me.

1461
01:07:38,593 --> 01:07:42,597
But this is my favorite,
three teenage girls in Africa

1462
01:07:42,630 --> 01:07:44,832
create a pee power generator.

1463
01:07:44,866 --> 01:07:48,603
And all of a sudden,
Ivy League professors come out

1464
01:07:48,636 --> 01:07:50,470
and say to the world
peeing on a generator

1465
01:07:50,505 --> 01:07:52,239
is not a big deal to create,

1466
01:07:52,272 --> 01:07:54,742
even though it has
never been created before.

1467
01:07:54,776 --> 01:07:58,178
And you call me nigger.

1468
01:07:58,211 --> 01:07:59,781
Me!

1469
01:07:59,814 --> 01:08:02,817
Born of a history
older than Christianity, eh?

1470
01:08:03,183 --> 01:08:05,587
Older than the Greek Empire.

1471
01:08:05,620 --> 01:08:07,354
Older than the Torah.

1472
01:08:07,622 --> 01:08:10,858
Of a time before
man to walk on two legs, eh?

1473
01:08:11,158 --> 01:08:16,129
You cultureless baboon.
You are a worthless nothing.

1474
01:08:48,328 --> 01:08:49,897
What have you done?

1475
01:08:50,565 --> 01:08:51,699
Please take it.

1476
01:08:53,701 --> 01:08:55,536
Somebody please take
the fucking gun from me.

1477
01:08:55,570 --> 01:08:56,738
Put it on the floor.

1478
01:09:01,241 --> 01:09:03,578
He just came at me.

1479
01:09:03,611 --> 01:09:05,813
- It happened so fast.
- No, he didn't.

1480
01:09:05,847 --> 01:09:07,615
He called me a nothing.

1481
01:09:07,982 --> 01:09:10,852
Yeah, and that's why
you shot him, you psychopath!

1482
01:09:10,885 --> 01:09:12,285
It was an accident.

1483
01:09:13,521 --> 01:09:15,857
The Prince
had everything figured out,

1484
01:09:15,890 --> 01:09:18,559
- you stupid asshole.
- Don't call me stupid.

1485
01:09:18,593 --> 01:09:20,193
What are you going to
do about it, huh?

1486
01:09:20,227 --> 01:09:21,863
- You stupid asshole.
- George!

1487
01:09:21,896 --> 01:09:23,931
How are you going to
let her talk to me like that?

1488
01:09:23,965 --> 01:09:26,668
His name's Diamond.
Be fucking professional.

1489
01:09:26,701 --> 01:09:28,402
I'm not supposed
to know your names.

1490
01:09:28,435 --> 01:09:29,904
I know this is beside the point,

1491
01:09:29,937 --> 01:09:31,639
but why isn't she tied up?

1492
01:09:32,006 --> 01:09:34,575
Really? That's what
you're concerned about?

1493
01:09:34,609 --> 01:09:36,376
Not the dead body on the ground?

1494
01:09:36,410 --> 01:09:38,211
It's a question,
a simple question.

1495
01:09:38,245 --> 01:09:39,614
I suggest we all walk away.

1496
01:09:39,647 --> 01:09:41,281
Somebody else
will find the body.

1497
01:09:41,314 --> 01:09:43,483
Excellent plan, Einstein.

1498
01:09:43,518 --> 01:09:45,318
The only problem is my key code.

1499
01:09:45,352 --> 01:09:46,921
My fucking key code
shows I was the last person

1500
01:09:46,954 --> 01:09:48,589
to show this place.

1501
01:09:48,623 --> 01:09:50,490
Well, why don't you
just tell the cops

1502
01:09:50,525 --> 01:09:52,259
you were
oblivious to everything?

1503
01:09:52,593 --> 01:09:54,696
Let's face it,
nobody seems to care that much

1504
01:09:54,729 --> 01:09:56,664
about finding
missing Black kids,

1505
01:09:56,698 --> 01:09:59,967
not to mention hunting down
the killer of some gang banger.

1506
01:10:00,001 --> 01:10:01,836
You must be
so proud of yourself.

1507
01:10:01,869 --> 01:10:03,805
I am a writer, I have
a very fertile imagination.

1508
01:10:03,838 --> 01:10:05,405
We need to call the cops

1509
01:10:05,439 --> 01:10:06,473
and tell them everything
that happened.

1510
01:10:06,908 --> 01:10:08,876
You want to go to jail?

1511
01:10:08,910 --> 01:10:11,311
You want to get raped in jail
by a hairy gorilla named Bruno?

1512
01:10:11,913 --> 01:10:13,548
I say we vote it in.

1513
01:10:13,581 --> 01:10:15,282
I'm not going to fucking jail.

1514
01:10:15,315 --> 01:10:16,718
So, we know your vote.
One for the cop,

1515
01:10:16,751 --> 01:10:18,285
and one against George.

1516
01:10:18,318 --> 01:10:20,621
George? George.
Think about Camilla.

1517
01:10:20,655 --> 01:10:22,456
Think about the wedding.

1518
01:10:22,489 --> 01:10:24,257
Think about the man
you want to be for Camilla.

1519
01:10:26,761 --> 01:10:28,529
Ah... I say we call the cops.

1520
01:10:28,563 --> 01:10:30,531
- Yes!
- Wait.

1521
01:10:31,032 --> 01:10:33,433
- She gets a vote, too!
- Are you serious?

1522
01:10:34,869 --> 01:10:37,304
She already had everything
figured out with the Prince.

1523
01:10:38,606 --> 01:10:40,440
It's over, Perry.
We're calling the cops.

1524
01:10:40,474 --> 01:10:41,809
We're calling the cops.

1525
01:10:41,843 --> 01:10:43,477
I vote against calling the cops.

1526
01:10:43,511 --> 01:10:45,278
What do you mean
we vote against?

1527
01:10:45,312 --> 01:10:46,514
It means she doesn't
want us going to the cops.

1528
01:10:47,014 --> 01:10:48,850
That's eight years
without your families.

1529
01:10:48,883 --> 01:10:51,552
And, yes,
you'd both get raped in prison.

1530
01:10:51,586 --> 01:10:53,955
Why do you care?
You walk away the victim.

1531
01:10:53,988 --> 01:10:55,556
That's the problem.

1532
01:10:55,590 --> 01:10:58,325
The victim.
What's the story, huh?

1533
01:10:58,358 --> 01:11:01,328
I get taken by three
inexperienced kidnappers

1534
01:11:01,361 --> 01:11:03,865
who kill a guy,
call the cops, and let me go?

1535
01:11:05,099 --> 01:11:06,934
Sounds as ridiculous
as you three.

1536
01:11:07,835 --> 01:11:11,506
Now, I control the narrative.
Now, the world is in my cage.

1537
01:11:11,539 --> 01:11:12,607
I own it.

1538
01:11:12,907 --> 01:11:14,441
I have no idea what that meant.

1539
01:11:15,408 --> 01:11:17,044
Me neither, but who cares?

1540
01:11:17,078 --> 01:11:18,646
I like where this is going.

1541
01:11:19,514 --> 01:11:21,916
Let's just take kidnapping
off the table.

1542
01:11:21,949 --> 01:11:25,553
- The Prince has resolved it.
- How?

1543
01:11:25,586 --> 01:11:27,387
None of your damn business.

1544
01:11:27,420 --> 01:11:30,024
Well, I think it is.
We are all in this together.

1545
01:11:30,057 --> 01:11:31,692
No, Nitro.

1546
01:11:32,026 --> 01:11:34,796
This is me helping you with
your friend's stupid choice.

1547
01:11:34,829 --> 01:11:36,831
- Don't call me stupid.
- He is not my friend.

1548
01:11:36,864 --> 01:11:38,900
I don't give a shit
what he is to you.

1549
01:11:39,200 --> 01:11:41,636
The only thing I know
is the only thing between us

1550
01:11:41,669 --> 01:11:45,039
and walking out that door
is this dead body.

1551
01:11:49,677 --> 01:11:51,344
More like stopping three of us.

1552
01:11:51,646 --> 01:11:53,446
Isabella,
what are you doing here?

1553
01:11:53,480 --> 01:11:55,650
Walk out that door.
You have done nothing wrong.

1554
01:11:56,150 --> 01:11:58,085
Go. Go, Miss Contini.

1555
01:11:58,119 --> 01:11:59,921
This is not your cross to carry.

1556
01:12:07,695 --> 01:12:09,462
There's a dead body
on the ground.

1557
01:12:09,496 --> 01:12:10,565
How do we handle it?

1558
01:12:12,767 --> 01:12:14,501
We're surrounded by trees.

1559
01:12:14,535 --> 01:12:16,003
We could dig a hole,
dump the body in there.

1560
01:12:16,037 --> 01:12:17,337
Nobody would ever find it.

1561
01:12:17,839 --> 01:12:20,842
Have you ever met
Camilla's sister?

1562
01:12:20,875 --> 01:12:22,543
No.

1563
01:12:22,577 --> 01:12:24,411
Well, she would burn
this whole city to ashes

1564
01:12:24,444 --> 01:12:25,813
looking for her husband.

1565
01:12:26,047 --> 01:12:27,882
Never underestimate
the length a wife will go

1566
01:12:27,915 --> 01:12:29,083
for the love of her husband.

1567
01:12:29,116 --> 01:12:30,952
This goes way beyond love.

1568
01:12:31,185 --> 01:12:33,420
You think he was scary?

1569
01:12:33,453 --> 01:12:36,489
You haven't met
Francesca Ortega.

1570
01:12:36,524 --> 01:12:38,559
Great. Someone new
to weigh on our dilemma.

1571
01:12:41,062 --> 01:12:43,831
- I got a story.
- What? What story?

1572
01:12:44,632 --> 01:12:48,736
George and I walked in
and saw Perry shot the Prince.

1573
01:12:48,769 --> 01:12:52,773
I go down, we all go down.

1574
01:12:53,373 --> 01:12:55,643
You must have
missed the memo, Perry.

1575
01:12:55,676 --> 01:12:57,678
- There was no kidnapping here.
- For the love of God.

1576
01:12:57,712 --> 01:13:00,081
Stick to Nitro,
Platinum, and Diamond.

1577
01:13:00,114 --> 01:13:01,916
No fucking real names.

1578
01:13:01,949 --> 01:13:03,517
Were you kidnapped,
Miss Contini?

1579
01:13:03,551 --> 01:13:04,919
No.

1580
01:13:04,952 --> 01:13:06,520
I think we have a story here.

1581
01:13:07,154 --> 01:13:09,023
Let's say
what this is really about.

1582
01:13:10,591 --> 01:13:11,959
This is about Aiko.

1583
01:13:12,492 --> 01:13:14,195
If it hadn't been me,
it would have been

1584
01:13:14,228 --> 01:13:15,763
anyone else off the street.

1585
01:13:15,796 --> 01:13:17,131
But, it was you.

1586
01:13:17,164 --> 01:13:19,166
You I would have
taken a bullet for.

1587
01:13:19,200 --> 01:13:20,735
Don't play broke or ignorant,
you knew a divorce was coming.

1588
01:13:20,768 --> 01:13:23,004
You had $73,000 stashed
to pay Aiko off.

1589
01:13:23,037 --> 01:13:25,006
And to you
that makes everything okay?

1590
01:13:27,708 --> 01:13:28,876
Well, Miss Contini,

1591
01:13:29,377 --> 01:13:31,045
we seem to be in a bit of a bind

1592
01:13:31,512 --> 01:13:33,814
because the last person
the Prince talked to

1593
01:13:34,248 --> 01:13:35,816
knew he was with you

1594
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:36,951
and wait for it,

1595
01:13:37,450 --> 01:13:40,554
it might have been
Francesca Ortega.

1596
01:13:41,222 --> 01:13:43,090
Not to mention your prints
are all over the place.

1597
01:13:43,124 --> 01:13:45,726
So, I advise you to reconsider
if you were ever here.

1598
01:13:45,760 --> 01:13:47,895
- But you killed him.
- Yes, I did.

1599
01:13:47,929 --> 01:13:49,964
But the question for the judge
and the jury will be,

1600
01:13:49,997 --> 01:13:51,498
did I do it alone?

1601
01:13:52,066 --> 01:13:54,068
God knows, I might have
to be the star witness

1602
01:13:54,101 --> 01:13:55,903
for the prosecution,
letting them know how

1603
01:13:56,771 --> 01:13:58,673
Isabella made me do it.

1604
01:13:58,706 --> 01:14:00,841
For once, Perry,
handle your responsibility.

1605
01:14:01,208 --> 01:14:04,645
Stop telling me
your fucking names.

1606
01:14:04,679 --> 01:14:06,814
I just remembered
another sweet, juicy detail.

1607
01:14:06,847 --> 01:14:09,617
Your fingerprints
are also on the gun.

1608
01:14:09,650 --> 01:14:11,786
I didn't kill anyone. No one.

1609
01:14:11,819 --> 01:14:13,521
Yeah, but it confirms
the story. Who knows?

1610
01:14:13,554 --> 01:14:14,722
Maybe I was forced to do it

1611
01:14:14,755 --> 01:14:16,657
by the angry black man and
his gay lover who both wanted

1612
01:14:16,691 --> 01:14:18,092
to impress the movie star.

1613
01:14:18,125 --> 01:14:19,994
- I'm gay now.
- What do you want?

1614
01:14:20,027 --> 01:14:23,496
I want... No, I need
for us to figure out

1615
01:14:23,531 --> 01:14:25,232
how to flush this shit out!

1616
01:14:25,266 --> 01:14:27,101
You two faced bastard.

1617
01:14:27,134 --> 01:14:28,501
Forgive me, George,
if I want to fucking survive.

1618
01:14:28,869 --> 01:14:30,738
Let's chill. Let's chill.

1619
01:14:30,771 --> 01:14:33,007
The only thing we have
to worry about is the Prince.

1620
01:14:33,441 --> 01:14:35,142
So, it would seem.

1621
01:14:36,077 --> 01:14:38,612
We can't bury him because
his wife might dig around

1622
01:14:38,646 --> 01:14:39,947
and somehow find out the truth.

1623
01:14:39,981 --> 01:14:41,716
- Yes.
- Yes.

1624
01:14:42,950 --> 01:14:44,484
So our solution...

1625
01:14:44,986 --> 01:14:47,121
we let the world
see the man shot to death.

1626
01:14:47,154 --> 01:14:49,724
At the same time,
we exonerate ourselves.

1627
01:14:49,757 --> 01:14:51,892
We can't be accessories
to his murder.

1628
01:14:51,926 --> 01:14:54,195
This is progress, three
Musketeers doing our thing.

1629
01:14:54,996 --> 01:14:57,064
I've got it.
The Prince came in here

1630
01:14:57,098 --> 01:14:58,933
trying to rape and murder
Isabella, and I shot him.

1631
01:14:58,966 --> 01:15:00,835
Nice touch with the rape.

1632
01:15:01,369 --> 01:15:04,805
A man like me saving her
from a man like him.

1633
01:15:04,839 --> 01:15:06,974
The press and the cops,
they would love it.

1634
01:15:07,008 --> 01:15:10,077
And you raise the hero
the world has been looking for.

1635
01:15:11,245 --> 01:15:13,114
Everybody needs
a hero to look up to.

1636
01:15:13,147 --> 01:15:14,582
One tiny thing.

1637
01:15:15,016 --> 01:15:18,052
- What's that?
- Francesca Ortega.

1638
01:15:18,085 --> 01:15:19,987
Again, with this woman.

1639
01:15:20,021 --> 01:15:21,756
The evidence is there, her
husband is an attempted rapist.

1640
01:15:21,789 --> 01:15:23,657
We all saw it.

1641
01:15:23,691 --> 01:15:25,993
Hiding the body is the better
plan compared to this

1642
01:15:26,027 --> 01:15:30,031
because Francesca Ortega
will find us, torture us,

1643
01:15:30,064 --> 01:15:33,934
and kill us in ways
that we have never imagined.

1644
01:15:33,968 --> 01:15:35,036
Screw this.

1645
01:15:35,469 --> 01:15:37,004
If she was so dangerous,

1646
01:15:37,038 --> 01:15:39,006
why have I never
heard of her before?

1647
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:40,708
You told us about the Prince.
Why not his dangerous wife?

1648
01:15:40,741 --> 01:15:44,979
Because some things
are safer not said.

1649
01:15:51,118 --> 01:15:52,720
I have a story to tell.

1650
01:15:54,955 --> 01:15:56,924
Please tell.
We're at the denouement.

1651
01:15:57,526 --> 01:16:00,027
This house?
Is it on the market?

1652
01:16:00,061 --> 01:16:01,162
Yes.

1653
01:16:01,595 --> 01:16:03,764
- Yes, I'm the realtor.
- Perfect.

1654
01:16:03,964 --> 01:16:05,800
You brought me in for a showing.

1655
01:16:05,833 --> 01:16:07,935
I really liked the house
and I thought about buying it.

1656
01:16:07,968 --> 01:16:09,737
Loving the story already.

1657
01:16:09,770 --> 01:16:11,338
What? What are you doing?

1658
01:16:11,372 --> 01:16:13,207
Trying to get
an estimate of the distance

1659
01:16:13,240 --> 01:16:15,042
from where the bullet
was fired to where he got shot.

1660
01:16:15,076 --> 01:16:16,710
There's nothing like a woman
with meat in her brains.

1661
01:16:17,778 --> 01:16:19,914
Okay, so you
bring me in for a showing.

1662
01:16:19,947 --> 01:16:21,782
You already said that.
What next?

1663
01:16:21,816 --> 01:16:23,684
How did you guys meet?
No phone records, no emails.

1664
01:16:24,118 --> 01:16:25,753
My office.

1665
01:16:25,786 --> 01:16:27,121
You just walked in
and demanded to see

1666
01:16:27,154 --> 01:16:29,023
this property from my catalog.

1667
01:16:29,490 --> 01:16:33,294
Yes, but unknown to us,
this dude,

1668
01:16:33,327 --> 01:16:35,729
let's call him
Mr. X, follows me.

1669
01:16:35,763 --> 01:16:37,665
I like it.
He follows you.

1670
01:16:37,698 --> 01:16:40,101
So you show me the house,
take me home, Mr. X follows me.

1671
01:16:40,134 --> 01:16:42,636
He attacks me. I fight
back but he overpowers me.

1672
01:16:42,670 --> 01:16:44,705
Maybe Mr. X injected you
with a sleeping drug.

1673
01:16:44,738 --> 01:16:46,107
Is that how
you guys got me here?

1674
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:47,842
Not our proudest moment.

1675
01:16:47,875 --> 01:16:49,143
But this ties George
to the place.

1676
01:16:49,176 --> 01:16:50,111
Why didn't he call the cops?

1677
01:16:51,312 --> 01:16:53,681
I wasn't aware I was
the last person she met.

1678
01:16:53,714 --> 01:16:55,816
She was reported missing
two days after.

1679
01:16:55,850 --> 01:16:57,952
Okay, that might fly.
The stalker biz might work too.

1680
01:16:57,985 --> 01:16:59,720
Celebrities have a lot of them.

1681
01:16:59,753 --> 01:17:02,289
Hmm, hmm. We sure do.
I mean she sure does.

1682
01:17:02,957 --> 01:17:05,826
So, the stalker
brings me back here.

1683
01:17:05,860 --> 01:17:07,061
He tied me up.

1684
01:17:07,596 --> 01:17:09,330
How did he get in
without breaking in?

1685
01:17:09,363 --> 01:17:11,132
You need a key code
to get into this place.

1686
01:17:11,165 --> 01:17:13,300
Uh, he must've snuck in
while we were browsing

1687
01:17:13,334 --> 01:17:14,869
this place
and left a window open.

1688
01:17:15,202 --> 01:17:17,204
Too premeditated. The cops
wouldn't think of that.

1689
01:17:17,238 --> 01:17:18,873
It was probably another realtor.

1690
01:17:18,906 --> 01:17:20,808
Another realtor
that has the key code.

1691
01:17:20,841 --> 01:17:22,810
If he used your key code,
it's someone that knew you.

1692
01:17:22,843 --> 01:17:24,311
Let's move on.
We'll come back to that.

1693
01:17:24,345 --> 01:17:25,846
What happened after
he tied you up here?

1694
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:28,215
Um, he did everything
you guys did.

1695
01:17:28,249 --> 01:17:30,084
What's his motive?
What did he want with you?

1696
01:17:30,117 --> 01:17:31,785
Same thing
every crazy fan wants.

1697
01:17:31,819 --> 01:17:34,155
He sees me on TV,
thinks he knows me.

1698
01:17:34,188 --> 01:17:36,223
He believes
that we belong together,

1699
01:17:36,257 --> 01:17:37,958
that we deserve
to work together.

1700
01:17:37,992 --> 01:17:39,226
The whole fan in love
with the star story

1701
01:17:39,260 --> 01:17:41,061
is a little ordinary.

1702
01:17:41,095 --> 01:17:42,897
I agree. We need to spice
Mr. X up a little bit.

1703
01:17:45,266 --> 01:17:47,301
He wants to convert
his dreams to reality.

1704
01:17:47,334 --> 01:17:49,036
He needs to tap into your being.

1705
01:17:49,638 --> 01:17:52,239
He wants to figure out
the mosaic of your soul.

1706
01:17:54,375 --> 01:17:55,676
How?

1707
01:17:57,077 --> 01:17:58,179
He studied you.

1708
01:17:59,180 --> 01:18:00,381
He asked you questions.

1709
01:18:03,851 --> 01:18:06,287
He needed to understand what
you felt when you did a scene.

1710
01:18:07,421 --> 01:18:11,258
Your addictions,
your sorrows, your woes.

1711
01:18:13,127 --> 01:18:16,030
Okay. That works.

1712
01:18:16,598 --> 01:18:18,365
Did Mr. X sexually assault you?

1713
01:18:18,567 --> 01:18:20,434
What's wrong with you?

1714
01:18:20,467 --> 01:18:22,269
It's a valid question.
If she was sexually assaulted,

1715
01:18:22,303 --> 01:18:24,004
there'd have to be bruises
or something to show.

1716
01:18:24,038 --> 01:18:26,240
No, he didn't.
It was more of a mind game.

1717
01:18:29,410 --> 01:18:33,180
He told me that
I would come to him.

1718
01:18:35,015 --> 01:18:36,784
I was going to beg for his love,

1719
01:18:37,818 --> 01:18:39,220
beg for his attention.

1720
01:18:41,388 --> 01:18:43,023
I tried.

1721
01:18:45,859 --> 01:18:46,961
But...

1722
01:18:47,861 --> 01:18:49,230
I broke.

1723
01:18:51,398 --> 01:18:52,933
He was right.

1724
01:18:54,969 --> 01:18:57,471
So sick...

1725
01:18:58,472 --> 01:19:00,508
how much I grew to love him.

1726
01:19:01,275 --> 01:19:03,244
Maybe it was just the essence.

1727
01:19:07,147 --> 01:19:08,782
How was that?

1728
01:19:08,816 --> 01:19:11,352
It... it was good.
I mean it was true!

1729
01:19:11,385 --> 01:19:13,053
Great.

1730
01:19:13,087 --> 01:19:15,155
The Prince.
How do we factor in Mr. X?

1731
01:19:16,056 --> 01:19:18,359
Phone records would
show I called him today.

1732
01:19:18,392 --> 01:19:21,328
His wife or whoever
was on the phone with him

1733
01:19:21,362 --> 01:19:23,163
knew he was coming here.

1734
01:19:23,197 --> 01:19:25,165
And even if he didn't,
the GPS in either the car

1735
01:19:25,199 --> 01:19:26,834
or phone would lead them here.

1736
01:19:26,867 --> 01:19:28,035
Got it!

1737
01:19:28,302 --> 01:19:30,004
You said you would
meet me here today

1738
01:19:30,037 --> 01:19:31,405
for a second look at the house.

1739
01:19:31,438 --> 01:19:32,973
And I promised
to make an introduction

1740
01:19:33,007 --> 01:19:34,908
with the Prince.

1741
01:19:34,942 --> 01:19:36,877
If the Prince knew
Isabella was still missing,

1742
01:19:36,910 --> 01:19:38,379
- why would still he come?
- That's probably why he came.

1743
01:19:38,412 --> 01:19:39,880
Why he came, he figured
she just might show.

1744
01:19:40,881 --> 01:19:42,383
Yes. Yes.

1745
01:19:42,416 --> 01:19:46,153
So he comes in,
finds me tied up, rescues me.

1746
01:19:46,186 --> 01:19:48,122
Mr. X comes out of nowhere
and shoots him in the chest.

1747
01:19:48,155 --> 01:19:49,823
I love it.

1748
01:19:49,857 --> 01:19:50,858
That should cover our tracks.

1749
01:19:51,258 --> 01:19:54,194
And now,
the million dollar question...

1750
01:19:55,496 --> 01:19:59,433
who is Mr. X?

1751
01:19:59,967 --> 01:20:01,468
Some wanderer off the street?

1752
01:20:01,835 --> 01:20:03,837
Can't be.
Doesn't justify us

1753
01:20:03,871 --> 01:20:05,472
getting in the house
with George's key code.

1754
01:20:05,507 --> 01:20:07,374
It has to be
someone who the cops

1755
01:20:07,408 --> 01:20:09,443
would believe has my key code.

1756
01:20:09,476 --> 01:20:12,580
It has to be someone
smart enough...

1757
01:20:14,248 --> 01:20:16,884
to want more than just my body.

1758
01:20:17,652 --> 01:20:20,120
Someone who might have
prior knowledge

1759
01:20:20,154 --> 01:20:22,456
of my first showing
of this place to Isabella.

1760
01:20:22,691 --> 01:20:26,960
Someone who would
like to work...

1761
01:20:28,128 --> 01:20:29,330
with you.

1762
01:20:31,365 --> 01:20:32,466
Ah...

1763
01:20:54,388 --> 01:20:56,256
I'm gonna need you
to give Mr. X some room.

1764
01:21:02,496 --> 01:21:03,964
Bella...

1765
01:21:05,199 --> 01:21:06,601
we can figure this out.

1766
01:21:08,469 --> 01:21:10,137
Nobody needs to get hurt.

1767
01:21:10,170 --> 01:21:11,271
It's the only way.

1768
01:21:11,639 --> 01:21:15,109
If you kill me,
it's cold blooded murder.

1769
01:21:15,510 --> 01:21:17,077
It's self-defense.

1770
01:21:17,712 --> 01:21:19,313
Aren't you going to
do something?

1771
01:21:19,681 --> 01:21:21,215
She wants to kill me.

1772
01:21:21,649 --> 01:21:23,217
Look it on the bright side,

1773
01:21:23,951 --> 01:21:25,553
someone will finally
read your book.

1774
01:21:26,721 --> 01:21:28,889
You don't have
the guts to take a life.

1775
01:21:29,557 --> 01:21:32,694
A life that takes nine months
to grow in a mother's womb.

1776
01:21:36,997 --> 01:21:38,533
For fuck sakes,
somebody stop her!

1777
01:22:01,556 --> 01:22:03,223
Murderer!

1778
01:22:04,626 --> 01:22:06,360
Messing things up for me!

1779
01:22:06,393 --> 01:22:07,961
Fuck you!

1780
01:22:07,995 --> 01:22:10,164
- Fuck the police!
- Fuck the.

1781
01:22:10,197 --> 01:22:12,534
Fuck you and your fucking!

1782
01:22:12,567 --> 01:22:14,501
You fucker!

1783
01:22:48,402 --> 01:22:50,204
Our story seems solid.

1784
01:23:10,057 --> 01:23:11,458
Do you feel like throwing up?

1785
01:23:12,493 --> 01:23:13,561
No.

1786
01:23:15,262 --> 01:23:16,463
Why?

1787
01:23:16,798 --> 01:23:19,433
You just stabbed a man
to death multiple times.

1788
01:23:23,170 --> 01:23:24,404
I don't know.

1789
01:23:24,873 --> 01:23:27,341
Right now,
I just don't feel like it.

1790
01:23:30,545 --> 01:23:32,780
How do you guys know
I'm not going to kill you next?

1791
01:23:40,287 --> 01:23:42,590
I'm just kidding.
I can't justify your deaths.

1792
01:23:42,624 --> 01:23:44,391
The right answer would be

1793
01:23:44,726 --> 01:23:47,662
it's inhumane to kill
another human being.

1794
01:23:48,763 --> 01:23:50,230
That's not funny.

1795
01:23:54,802 --> 01:23:56,069
Yeah.

1796
01:24:03,377 --> 01:24:04,478
Diamond?

1797
01:24:09,249 --> 01:24:10,317
George?

1798
01:24:16,758 --> 01:24:18,292
I'll see you at the wedding.

1799
01:24:48,756 --> 01:24:50,357
What happens now?

1800
01:24:51,325 --> 01:24:52,760
I'll give you my card.

1801
01:24:54,596 --> 01:24:57,699
And I'll become your manager
for the usual 10%.

1802
01:24:58,131 --> 01:25:02,202
Hey, Kevin, this truly
has been a bonding moment.

1803
01:25:04,438 --> 01:25:06,608
But I think managing
someone like me

1804
01:25:07,341 --> 01:25:09,911
right now in my career
is below your pay grade.

1805
01:25:09,944 --> 01:25:11,746
If I can manage an idiot

1806
01:25:12,179 --> 01:25:14,381
like Senator Grummer
to win an election,

1807
01:25:15,083 --> 01:25:16,618
you have nothing to worry about.

1808
01:25:19,152 --> 01:25:22,255
My mother's third husband
is Senator Grummer.

1809
01:25:22,289 --> 01:25:24,659
It'd be a wild coincidence
if you worked for him.

1810
01:25:24,892 --> 01:25:26,326
You had no intention

1811
01:25:26,360 --> 01:25:27,929
of killing her from the start.

1812
01:25:27,962 --> 01:25:30,163
You expected us to say no.
You wanted us to say no.

1813
01:25:30,197 --> 01:25:31,566
Don't play broke or ignorant.
You knew a divorce was coming.

1814
01:25:31,599 --> 01:25:34,669
You had $73,000 stashed
to pay Aiko off.

1815
01:25:34,702 --> 01:25:37,270
Before I received this call,
I could have sworn

1816
01:25:37,304 --> 01:25:39,172
you planned the whole thing
and I applauded it

1817
01:25:39,206 --> 01:25:40,842
as a master comeback.

1818
01:25:41,643 --> 01:25:43,276
You may not see it now,

1819
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:45,345
but your mother
loves you in her way.

1820
01:25:45,379 --> 01:25:48,415
Even better,
she's misdirecting the cops

1821
01:25:48,448 --> 01:25:50,217
with your missing story.

1822
01:25:50,250 --> 01:25:52,386
That's why the cops
aren't looking for...

1823
01:25:52,419 --> 01:25:54,354
I took the hood off.
Her life belongs to me

1824
01:25:54,388 --> 01:25:55,923
until she walks away from here.

1825
01:26:00,795 --> 01:26:02,697
Perry's keys.

1826
01:26:04,431 --> 01:26:05,633
His car's parked outside.

1827
01:26:06,199 --> 01:26:09,269
Drive five minutes south,
you'll hit the police station.

1828
01:26:09,904 --> 01:26:12,674
Bust in, scared and confused
with a bloody knife.

1829
01:26:13,908 --> 01:26:15,743
You're white and pretty.
They won't shoot you.

1830
01:26:18,378 --> 01:26:20,480
I'll leave the contracts
with you tomorrow.

1831
01:26:21,448 --> 01:26:23,751
For now, we'll keep
this on the hush-hush

1832
01:26:23,785 --> 01:26:24,986
until this blows over.

1833
01:26:33,393 --> 01:26:34,829
Why'd you take the hood off?

1834
01:26:37,865 --> 01:26:42,235
For the story to click.
George and I were never here.

1835
01:26:42,770 --> 01:26:44,237
My mother paid you.

1836
01:26:45,606 --> 01:26:48,308
Why fuck it all up
by taking the hood off?

1837
01:26:48,341 --> 01:26:49,777
Think about it, Bella.

1838
01:26:50,343 --> 01:26:52,547
The only reason
we are partners...

1839
01:26:53,781 --> 01:26:55,983
is because I took the hood off.

1840
01:28:21,602 --> 01:28:23,571
<i>Your daughter is safe.</i>

1841
01:28:23,604 --> 01:28:25,506
<i>The deal has changed.</i>

1842
01:28:25,540 --> 01:28:27,608
<i>You screwed up the agreement,
enjoying a life</i>

1843
01:28:27,642 --> 01:28:29,944
<i>and not delivering the million.</i>

1844
01:28:29,977 --> 01:28:33,881
<i>I will be seeing you soon.
Partner.</i>
