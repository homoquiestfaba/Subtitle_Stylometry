Synced by Verifonix.

2
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,690
All right.

3
00:00:54,730 --> 00:00:56,490
Make it two. Make it two.

4
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:09,210
(steam hissing)

5
00:01:09,250 --> 00:01:11,210
(horns honking)

6
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,210
Man: I haven't got all day!

7
00:01:13,250 --> 00:01:16,170
Children chanting: Hubies! Hubies!
Hubies! Hubies!

8
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:23,490
(children cheering)

9
00:01:36,730 --> 00:01:39,050
I want to play in that game so bad.

10
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:40,490
Yeah, right, Banks.

11
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:42,610
You've got to be at least 5' tall.

12
00:01:42,650 --> 00:01:44,610
Rejected.

13
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,130
Yo, there's that kid I was
telling you about-- Mick Leary.

14
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:55,410
He's the baddest kid
in the village.

15
00:01:57,450 --> 00:01:59,370
Charlie's voice:
The first time I saw him,

16
00:01:59,410 --> 00:02:01,690
Mick was already infamous.

17
00:02:01,730 --> 00:02:03,890
Danny told the story
of the legendary ass-kicking

18
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:07,890
Mick gave Alfie Lucio for tagging
over his tag on the schoolyard wall--

19
00:02:07,930 --> 00:02:10,450
how Alfie was begging for mercy,

20
00:02:10,490 --> 00:02:12,410
but Mick just wouldn't stop.

21
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:14,090
Alfie: Stop stop stop!

22
00:02:14,130 --> 00:02:17,330
Charlie's voice: I couldn't get
my 10-year-old head around it.

23
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:21,490
How could he do that?

24
00:02:21,530 --> 00:02:23,330
How could he not stop?

25
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:30,450
Did you see that?
He knows me.

26
00:02:30,490 --> 00:02:32,370
Yeah, man, he said
"What's up?" to me.

27
00:02:36,370 --> 00:02:39,570
Charlie's voice: Every kid grows up
with a bogeyman under his bed.

28
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:42,890
Mine terrorized Greenwich Village
and smoked Newports.

29
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,850

00:03:23,530 --> 00:03:25,930

00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:05,690
(woman giggling)
Stop it. Stop.

49
00:05:11,090 --> 00:05:13,130
Oh, hey, Mick.

50
00:05:13,170 --> 00:05:15,090
Hey, boy.

51
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:17,130
- Yo.
- Hey, Gabby.

52
00:05:17,170 --> 00:05:19,370
- Hey, Mick.
- What're you doing?

53
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:21,330
Hey, this is Charlie.

54
00:05:21,370 --> 00:05:23,130
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey.

55
00:05:23,170 --> 00:05:25,090
Um, this is Beth.

56
00:05:25,130 --> 00:05:27,050
Hey.

57
00:05:28,050 --> 00:05:29,930
Hey, do I know you?

58
00:05:29,970 --> 00:05:32,050
Um, not officially.

59
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,530
No no no, he lives uptown.

60
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:37,210
He goes to Trinity.
I know him from Hubies.

61
00:05:37,250 --> 00:05:39,490
Oh.

62
00:05:39,530 --> 00:05:42,490
It's nice to officially meet
another of Danny boy's boojie friends

63
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,450
from his boojie sports camp.

64
00:05:44,490 --> 00:05:46,850
(can hissing)

65
00:05:54,970 --> 00:05:57,330
BC.

66
00:05:58,970 --> 00:06:01,810
Blue collar-- big color.

67
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:04,170
Any friend of Danny boy's
is a friend of mine.

68
00:06:04,210 --> 00:06:06,370
Oh. No, I don't have a tag.

69
00:06:08,570 --> 00:06:10,890
Boojie boy.

70
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:15,090
Okay. How do you spell that?

71
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,970
Give me that.

72
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:22,010
Hey, he likes you.

73
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:30,610
Yeah.

74
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:32,810
- Yo, Danny, come on.
- Hey, shut up.

75
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:35,890
All right.

76
00:06:35,930 --> 00:06:38,410
Yeah, right?

77
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:43,330
Hey.

78
00:06:43,370 --> 00:06:45,650
- Hey, whoa.
- Tim, get off me.

79
00:06:45,650 --> 00:06:49,610
Danny, Mick, this is Julie's cousin
from Larchmont-- Tim.

80
00:06:49,650 --> 00:06:51,570
And that's Owen.

81
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:53,530
Hey, what's up, guys?

82
00:06:53,570 --> 00:06:55,890
Yo, you mind vacating
so I can piss?

83
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:57,850
Yeah, I mind.

84
00:06:57,890 --> 00:06:59,050
You want to watch me?

85
00:06:59,090 --> 00:07:00,730
Gabby: Tim, shut up.
Just wait a minute.

86
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:02,690
Yeah, right.
The guy's being a dick.

87
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:04,170
Seriously, get the fuck out.

88
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,610
You guys, just use the bathroom
downstairs. I'm serious.

89
00:07:07,650 --> 00:07:09,930
Fuck no.
Do I look like a pussy?

90
00:07:09,970 --> 00:07:12,130
Yeah, kind of.

91
00:07:15,250 --> 00:07:16,490
Outside.

92
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:17,970
Lead the way.

93
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:21,930
You're fucking dead.

94
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:26,890
Duty calls.

95
00:07:27,850 --> 00:07:29,930
- No.
- Why? Are you sure?

96
00:07:29,970 --> 00:07:31,450
Yeah. Booje, let's go,

97
00:07:31,490 --> 00:07:33,010
- you and me, come on.
- What?

98
00:07:33,050 --> 00:07:35,010
- Come on.
- What?

99
00:07:35,050 --> 00:07:36,650
Don't worry about it.
Go with him. You'll be fine.

100
00:07:36,690 --> 00:07:38,450
- No, l--
- Don't worry about it. Go.

101
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,770
All right.
All right.

102
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,450
(loud bang)

103
00:07:44,490 --> 00:07:46,410
Hold my gold.

104
00:07:53,650 --> 00:07:56,130
Girl: Do something.

105
00:08:23,010 --> 00:08:27,490
Ooh, now you really
look like a pussy.

106
00:08:45,570 --> 00:08:47,530
Blue collar-- big color.

107
00:08:59,570 --> 00:09:02,690
Boojie--

108
00:09:02,730 --> 00:09:05,290
B-O-O-J-l-E.

109
00:10:03,890 --> 00:10:06,250
(fence rattles)

110
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:12,010
Man: Your statement's
very incriminating.

111
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:14,730
We can put this guy away
with your help.

112
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:16,690
What is he being charged with?

113
00:10:16,730 --> 00:10:18,130
Attempted murder.

114
00:10:18,130 --> 00:10:20,290
Both boys are
in critical condition.

115
00:10:20,330 --> 00:10:23,010
Attempted murder?

116
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:24,690
How bad is this kid?

117
00:10:24,730 --> 00:10:27,370
He's got a substantial jacket.

118
00:10:27,410 --> 00:10:29,090
You heard the phrase
"born to lose"?

119
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:31,170
Coined for Leary.

120
00:10:31,210 --> 00:10:34,090
So what's his story?

121
00:10:34,130 --> 00:10:37,210
No father, a sketchy mother,
mostly state-raised.

122
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:39,810
Got charisma, though.

123
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:42,090
Got a following
down in the village--

124
00:10:42,130 --> 00:10:45,290
good kids too,
like Charlie.

125
00:10:45,330 --> 00:10:48,050
That's mostly about
beating up rich kids

126
00:10:48,090 --> 00:10:50,490
and graffiti.

127
00:10:50,530 --> 00:10:52,210
I'm not a part of it.

128
00:10:52,250 --> 00:10:54,650
Not many kids would have the guts
to do what you're doing.

129
00:10:54,690 --> 00:10:56,130
You should be proud
of yourself.

130
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:03,690
Spread 'em. Spread 'em.

131
00:11:03,730 --> 00:11:07,690
Come on, read him his
fucking rights or something.

132
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:11,970
- Give me your hand.
- Are you fucking kidding me?

133
00:11:12,010 --> 00:11:14,770
Shut up.

134
00:11:14,770 --> 00:11:17,810
Give me your other hand.
Come on.

135
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:20,770
Let's go. Let's go.

136
00:11:20,810 --> 00:11:22,730
This is bullshit, man.

137
00:11:22,770 --> 00:11:24,490
Go.

138
00:11:24,530 --> 00:11:26,850
I smell your fucking cologne,
you piece of shit.

139
00:11:37,570 --> 00:11:39,930
(rings doorbell)

140
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:41,930
Man: I got it.

141
00:11:45,410 --> 00:11:47,850
(quiet piano music playing)

142
00:11:51,130 --> 00:11:53,090
(door opens and closes)

143
00:11:56,770 --> 00:11:59,290
Oh, hey. Hey.

144
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:01,050
You guys know
Charlie Banks, right?

145
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,570
- Hi.
- Do we?

146
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:09,130
Guess what.

147
00:12:09,170 --> 00:12:13,490
Well, Mick's in jail.

148
00:12:13,530 --> 00:12:16,290
Somebody ratted him out
for beating up those two guys

149
00:12:16,330 --> 00:12:18,530
at Gary's party. Remember?

150
00:12:18,570 --> 00:12:20,490
Who?

151
00:12:20,530 --> 00:12:22,410
I don't know.

152
00:12:22,450 --> 00:12:25,130
- Holy shit.
- Yeah, seriously.

153
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:30,730
So what's gonna happen?

154
00:12:30,770 --> 00:12:34,610
I don't know,
but whoever ratted him out

155
00:12:34,650 --> 00:12:37,170
better not show their face
below 14th Street again.

156
00:12:37,210 --> 00:12:39,610
They'd get their asses kicked.

157
00:12:41,330 --> 00:12:43,090
You think he should go to jail?

158
00:12:43,130 --> 00:12:44,770
No.

159
00:12:44,810 --> 00:12:47,050
I don't know, he hurt those guys
at the party pretty bad.

160
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:51,610
The deal with Mick is,

161
00:12:51,650 --> 00:12:54,290
you know, he can be
a really great guy.

162
00:12:54,330 --> 00:12:58,490
But he's just--
he's got this thing.

163
00:12:58,530 --> 00:13:00,290
I mean, you saw
how cool he was with you.

164
00:13:00,330 --> 00:13:02,010
Yeah, he called me boojie.

165
00:13:02,050 --> 00:13:03,690
So? You are.

166
00:13:03,730 --> 00:13:05,330
I am and you're not?

167
00:13:05,370 --> 00:13:07,730
Fuck no.
You can't tag and be a booje.

168
00:13:07,730 --> 00:13:09,650
Danny, you're rich.
You're pretty much boojie.

169
00:13:09,690 --> 00:13:11,610
I'm not rich.
I told you that already.

170
00:13:11,650 --> 00:13:13,130
I'm not rich.
My parents are rich.

171
00:13:13,170 --> 00:13:14,970
Yeah, right.

172
00:13:15,010 --> 00:13:17,810
Look, Mick's my friend,
you know?

173
00:13:17,850 --> 00:13:19,690
We grew up in the neighborhood
together.

174
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:22,410
He's got my back no matter what.
That's what friends do for each other.

175
00:13:22,450 --> 00:13:23,850
It's what I'd do for you.

176
00:13:23,890 --> 00:13:25,930
No matter what?

177
00:13:27,890 --> 00:13:29,770
Yeah, no matter what.

178
00:13:32,330 --> 00:13:34,090
All right, come on.

179
00:13:35,050 --> 00:13:37,370
(chattering)

180
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:42,090
You know what? Actually, Danny,
I'm gonna go help my dad at the store.

181
00:13:42,130 --> 00:13:44,490
- Are you serious?
- Yeah. I'll see you later.

182
00:13:44,530 --> 00:13:46,770
All right, later,
you fucking weirdo.

183
00:13:46,810 --> 00:13:49,090
- Man: Danny.
- Yo.

184
00:13:49,130 --> 00:13:50,810
(distant siren wailing)

185
00:13:50,850 --> 00:13:53,250
Danny: Yo, Terry.

186
00:13:59,890 --> 00:14:01,730
You could do
whatever you want.

187
00:14:01,770 --> 00:14:03,650
I could just say my statement
was made under duress;

188
00:14:03,730 --> 00:14:05,610
it was all lies;
I stand by none of it.

189
00:14:05,650 --> 00:14:08,570
Where'd you pick up
that bullshit?

190
00:14:08,610 --> 00:14:11,050
My father owns a bookstore.

191
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:12,970
I looked it up.

192
00:14:13,010 --> 00:14:14,930
- Has somebody threatened you?
- No.

193
00:14:14,970 --> 00:14:16,370
What happened?

194
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:18,090
I changed my mind.

195
00:14:18,130 --> 00:14:20,330
Oh.

196
00:14:20,370 --> 00:14:22,450
What's your old man
have to say about it?

197
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:25,410
Um...

198
00:14:25,450 --> 00:14:27,370
You didn't tell him, did you?

199
00:14:27,410 --> 00:14:31,170
There could conceivably be
legal ramifications to this,

200
00:14:31,250 --> 00:14:34,530
not to mention those two kids
almost died.

201
00:14:37,330 --> 00:14:39,810
(phones ringing)

202
00:14:45,090 --> 00:14:47,050
(door chime jingles)

203
00:14:51,930 --> 00:14:54,530
What did you do,
drop out of school?

204
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:55,970
Worse.

205
00:14:56,050 --> 00:14:57,970
Did you join the army?

206
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:03,890
Hi. I got a call from the DA.

207
00:15:03,930 --> 00:15:06,770
I'm terribly disappointed
with the choice you made.

208
00:15:06,770 --> 00:15:09,610
Actually, it's a little more
complicated than that.

209
00:15:09,650 --> 00:15:10,690
Bullshit.

210
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:14,690
There's no justification
for senseless brutality.

211
00:15:14,730 --> 00:15:16,610
And you were not raised
to stand by and condone it.

212
00:15:16,690 --> 00:15:18,370
I'm not condoning it.

213
00:15:18,410 --> 00:15:22,210
The DA is dropping the case
because you were all they had.

214
00:15:22,250 --> 00:15:24,690
And this Leary character--

215
00:15:24,730 --> 00:15:28,170
he spent the last three weeks in jail
for what he did to these two boys,

216
00:15:28,210 --> 00:15:29,770
and now he's just gonna
walk away.

217
00:15:29,810 --> 00:15:32,850
Well, I'm sorry.

218
00:15:36,210 --> 00:15:38,090
Yeah.

219
00:15:39,450 --> 00:15:42,690
You can have a head
full of the best ideas,

220
00:15:42,730 --> 00:15:46,730
but if you can't make
the right moves in the world,

221
00:15:46,770 --> 00:15:49,210
they're worthless.

222
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:09,250
Charlie's voice: I stayed out
of the Village and avoided Mick

223
00:16:09,290 --> 00:16:12,250
for the next couple of years
until I went away to school.

224
00:16:12,290 --> 00:16:14,650
And after a while
the fight on the roof

225
00:16:14,690 --> 00:16:16,810
and my flirtation
with the judicial system

226
00:16:16,850 --> 00:16:19,250
faded from my daily thoughts
like a bruise.

227
00:16:19,250 --> 00:16:21,530
I was in college now.

228
00:16:21,570 --> 00:16:24,010
It was time to start over
and aim high.

229
00:16:24,050 --> 00:16:27,250
Only two things mattered--
books and girls.

230
00:16:27,290 --> 00:16:30,410
Well, one thing really.

231
00:16:30,450 --> 00:16:33,650
¶...Perfect way
to end the war of ways ¶

232
00:16:33,690 --> 00:16:35,890
¶ The only way to be a ¶

233
00:16:35,930 --> 00:16:39,250
¶ Work of art ¶

234
00:16:39,250 --> 00:16:43,530
¶ Oh, to be a work of art ¶

235
00:16:45,610 --> 00:16:49,610
¶ Work of art ¶

236
00:16:49,650 --> 00:16:53,170
¶ Oh, to be a work of art... ¶

237
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,450
(exhales)

238
00:17:13,810 --> 00:17:15,490
(chuckles)

239
00:17:16,890 --> 00:17:18,890
Oh, thanks.
These were a gift.

240
00:17:20,370 --> 00:17:23,850
Are you down with Schumpeter's theory
of constructive destruction?

241
00:17:23,890 --> 00:17:27,370
No, but it sounds very cheeky
and kind of ironic.

242
00:17:27,410 --> 00:17:28,490
Hmm.

243
00:17:28,530 --> 00:17:30,450
Yeah, Schumpeter posits

244
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:32,970
that when industries advance
new technologies

245
00:17:33,010 --> 00:17:36,650
that cannibalize the old--
it's constructive destruction.

246
00:17:36,690 --> 00:17:38,730
Yeah, you gotta be cruel
to be kind.

247
00:17:38,770 --> 00:17:40,690
That's not Schumpeter.

248
00:17:40,730 --> 00:17:42,250
No, Nick Lowe.

249
00:17:42,290 --> 00:17:44,370
Hmm.

250
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:47,250
Well, spare the rod--
spoil the child.

251
00:17:47,290 --> 00:17:50,210
Uh, no pain, no gain.

252
00:17:50,250 --> 00:17:51,650
(chuckles)

253
00:17:51,730 --> 00:17:53,770
Ever cloud has
a silver lining.

254
00:17:53,810 --> 00:17:55,850
Okay, we need to leave
this room immediately.

255
00:17:55,890 --> 00:17:58,290
Yeah.

256
00:17:58,330 --> 00:18:00,010
- It's depressing.
- It is depressing.

257
00:18:00,050 --> 00:18:02,370
(chattering, laughing)

258
00:18:03,330 --> 00:18:05,610
Oh, man, yo, there she is.

259
00:18:05,650 --> 00:18:08,610
Yo, she's going into the Wick.
Wait, hold on. Hold on.

260
00:18:08,650 --> 00:18:10,170
- What, her?
- Yeah.

261
00:18:10,210 --> 00:18:13,250
I don't want to follow her right in.
I might as well bring some binoculars.

262
00:18:13,290 --> 00:18:15,890
What, she's what?
She's a super-hot scion

263
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:19,010
of a 200-year-old American
political dynasty?

264
00:18:19,050 --> 00:18:20,850
- Yeah.
- Well, okay, your grandfather

265
00:18:20,890 --> 00:18:23,330
ran the communist party from above
this fish market in Philadelphia.

266
00:18:23,370 --> 00:18:25,210
I see huge possibilities
here, Charlie.

267
00:18:25,250 --> 00:18:26,890
- Hey, what the fuck is wrong with you?
- What?

268
00:18:26,930 --> 00:18:28,810
Why do you wear those shitty-ass
Capezios

269
00:18:28,850 --> 00:18:30,890
like you're some kind of moof
who can't afford a new pair?

270
00:18:30,930 --> 00:18:32,170
What, you hate my shoes?

271
00:18:32,210 --> 00:18:35,610
Yeah, obviously. I've been
given the gift of sight, unfortunately.

272
00:18:35,650 --> 00:18:38,690
- Charlie, you hate my shoes?
- Yeah, and you got something there.

273
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:41,650
- I'll kick your ass with these shoes.
- It won't hurt.

274
00:18:44,370 --> 00:18:46,090
- Charlie Banks!
- Hi.

275
00:18:46,130 --> 00:18:48,530
Hey, how goes the story
with our man Raskolnikov?

276
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,690
Okay.

277
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:53,170
- Dude, Mary is over there.
- You're on your own.

278
00:18:53,210 --> 00:18:55,330
So is her roommate, El Greco.
I know you think she's fine.

279
00:18:55,370 --> 00:18:57,370
I see you looking at her all the time.
Thanks.

280
00:18:57,410 --> 00:18:59,530
Danny, you need to examine
your isolationist stance.

281
00:18:59,570 --> 00:19:03,090
He only wants to hang out with you
because he hasn't done his reading

282
00:19:03,130 --> 00:19:06,010
in his Russian Lit class. You know that,
right? And there goes your beer.

283
00:19:06,050 --> 00:19:07,210
They're all like that, man.

284
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:09,170
He hasn't done his reading
in any of his classes.

285
00:19:09,170 --> 00:19:10,930
And you don't know
what they're all like. Come on.

286
00:19:10,970 --> 00:19:12,650
Leo, Leo, hi.

287
00:19:12,690 --> 00:19:15,570
Charlie. Charlie Banks.
You look great.

288
00:19:15,570 --> 00:19:17,770
- Hey, come here. This is Mary.
- I'm Mary.

289
00:19:17,810 --> 00:19:20,170
- Hi. Charlie.
- And the lovely Nia.

290
00:19:20,210 --> 00:19:21,330
- Hi.
- Nice to meet you.

291
00:19:21,370 --> 00:19:22,570
Charlie Banks.
Take a seat.

292
00:19:22,610 --> 00:19:25,170
Oh, this is Danny.
He's my better half.

293
00:19:25,210 --> 00:19:27,130
Danny, how are you?
A pleasure.

294
00:19:27,170 --> 00:19:29,410
You know, you can sit down
like a real human being.

295
00:19:29,450 --> 00:19:32,010
Hey, you know, if you guys
play poker

296
00:19:32,050 --> 00:19:34,730
there's a game tonight at my place
after last call.

297
00:19:34,770 --> 00:19:36,850
- What kind of stakes?
- Oral sex.

298
00:19:36,890 --> 00:19:38,250
Ew, Leo.

299
00:19:38,290 --> 00:19:40,610
Sorry. Oh, Nia, of course,

300
00:19:40,650 --> 00:19:45,050
is only committed to handle any male
genitalia with external appendages.

301
00:19:45,090 --> 00:19:48,570
- What, is that just hands?
- No no, feet as well.

302
00:19:48,610 --> 00:19:50,410
Why is that?

303
00:19:50,450 --> 00:19:52,570
Leo: Well, she's already
spoken for.

304
00:19:52,610 --> 00:19:55,330
Thus her more intimate cavities
are out of bounds.

305
00:19:55,370 --> 00:19:58,210
Her parents, as it's a Greek custom,

306
00:19:58,250 --> 00:19:59,890
have promised her to a man

307
00:19:59,930 --> 00:20:02,530
for three goats, 40 drachmas

308
00:20:02,570 --> 00:20:04,810
and half a ton of veggies, right?
I'm sorry.

309
00:20:04,850 --> 00:20:07,730
We're in French class
together, right?

310
00:20:07,770 --> 00:20:10,730
- Yeah.
- We've got an exam tomorrow.

311
00:20:10,770 --> 00:20:13,170
That's right, yeah.
You have an exam tomorrow.

312
00:20:13,210 --> 00:20:15,130
We all have exams tomorrow.

313
00:20:15,170 --> 00:20:19,010
Can I please have another tequila shot
and a round for my friends--

314
00:20:19,050 --> 00:20:23,050
three for Nia and two for these two
lovely ladies? Thank you.

315
00:20:23,090 --> 00:20:25,410
Man: You got it, Leo.

316
00:20:25,450 --> 00:20:29,170
Charlie, you know what?
I remember being a freshman.

317
00:20:29,210 --> 00:20:31,850
Those were the two best years
of my life.

318
00:20:38,530 --> 00:20:40,490
Danny: Luck? Did you say luck?

319
00:20:40,530 --> 00:20:42,690
What?

320
00:20:42,730 --> 00:20:45,010
Luck is half the game in this thing.

321
00:20:45,050 --> 00:20:47,210
It's statistics. It's reading people--

322
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:50,730
seeing who's betting big
and who's bluffing.

323
00:20:50,770 --> 00:20:52,810
- Charlie: Right.
- Danny: I got a read on you.

324
00:20:52,850 --> 00:20:56,090
You know what it's like?
There's this guy from the neighborhood,

325
00:20:56,130 --> 00:20:58,410
Fat-Ass Tommy.

326
00:20:58,450 --> 00:21:00,370
- (laughing)
- That's funny?

327
00:21:00,370 --> 00:21:02,730
- Isn't it supposed to be funny?
- No, it's not supposed to be funny.

328
00:21:02,770 --> 00:21:05,810
- Do you want me to tell my story?
- No, it's incredibly deep and profound.

329
00:21:05,850 --> 00:21:07,770
- Please tell it.
- Okay, fine.

330
00:21:07,810 --> 00:21:10,730
Fat-Ass Tommy says that luck is

331
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:13,050
like milk and cigarettes, okay?

332
00:21:13,090 --> 00:21:15,410
Eventually it runs out.

333
00:21:15,450 --> 00:21:18,690
- Simple terms, but it's true.
- Charlie: I think it's just simple.

334
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:20,970
I don't know if there's
much truth to that.

335
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:23,450
- Who is this Fat-Ass Tommy?
- That's Danny's imaginary friend

336
00:21:23,490 --> 00:21:24,890
- from the neighborhood, right?
- Yeah.

337
00:21:24,930 --> 00:21:26,610
I think you're
sitting on him, Nia.

338
00:21:26,650 --> 00:21:30,250
You know what? Seriously, guys,
I'm not even--

339
00:21:30,290 --> 00:21:32,810
I'm not even that good at this game.
You guys just suck.

340
00:21:32,850 --> 00:21:34,410
Oh, really?

341
00:21:34,450 --> 00:21:37,450
Okay, I'm sorry. Charlie sucks.
You guys are painfully mediocre.

342
00:21:37,490 --> 00:21:39,210
You know what?
You're going down, bitch,

343
00:21:39,250 --> 00:21:42,090
'cause I'm gonna put one of these
red currencies in for $5.

344
00:21:42,130 --> 00:21:44,490
You've got nothing, Charlemagne,
nothing but wet dreams.

345
00:21:44,530 --> 00:21:48,010
I'll see that
and I'll raise you $5.

346
00:21:48,050 --> 00:21:50,450
Oh, there's a raise.
All right, I'm in.

347
00:21:50,450 --> 00:21:52,650
- I fold.
- You fold?

348
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:56,170
- Really?
- Okay, well, last card, down and dirty.

349
00:21:59,250 --> 00:22:02,690
Charlie: Oh, wow. Wow.

350
00:22:02,730 --> 00:22:05,450
No, it's exciting for me.

351
00:22:05,490 --> 00:22:09,250
- Bets to Charlie.
- All right, another $5.

352
00:22:09,290 --> 00:22:11,170
I'll see that again.

353
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,450
How do you feel about that?

354
00:22:13,490 --> 00:22:16,290
- What are you guys doing?
- I'm done.

355
00:22:16,330 --> 00:22:17,810
Oh, that's just great.

356
00:22:17,850 --> 00:22:19,850
What time is it?

357
00:22:19,890 --> 00:22:21,930
- Mary: Charlie.
- 'Cause I'm getting tired.

358
00:22:21,970 --> 00:22:25,010
Too bad. I knew your plan to bluff
before I even dealt the cards.

359
00:22:25,050 --> 00:22:26,610
- Did you?
- Yeah, I did.

360
00:22:26,650 --> 00:22:28,530
- It's obvious?
- Yeah, very obvious.

361
00:22:28,570 --> 00:22:30,130
Did you tell him?

362
00:22:30,170 --> 00:22:32,170
Hey, is that true what Leo said
about Nia?

363
00:22:32,210 --> 00:22:34,610
Oh, before she was even born

364
00:22:34,610 --> 00:22:37,330
she was promised to the son
of her father's business partner.

365
00:22:37,370 --> 00:22:39,050
Jesus Christ.

366
00:22:39,090 --> 00:22:41,410
He's a billionaire
and really handsome,

367
00:22:41,450 --> 00:22:43,170
but he's 35, you know?

368
00:22:43,210 --> 00:22:45,850
It's a business deal,
not a romance.

369
00:22:45,890 --> 00:22:48,210
Yeah, that's insane.

370
00:22:48,250 --> 00:22:49,690
Here.

371
00:22:49,730 --> 00:22:52,010
Don't you think it takes
all the fun out of life

372
00:22:52,050 --> 00:22:54,090
when you're hitched up
right out of the gate?

373
00:22:54,130 --> 00:22:57,370
Well, it's a little safer that way.

374
00:22:57,410 --> 00:22:59,410
Yeah.

375
00:23:01,170 --> 00:23:02,410
Thanks for this.

376
00:23:02,450 --> 00:23:04,770
Yeah, you can send me a leaf
in return.

377
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:06,610
- See you soon.
- All right, good night.

378
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:08,930
That was fun.

379
00:23:08,970 --> 00:23:11,530
Anybody use you
or take advantage of you in any way?

380
00:23:11,570 --> 00:23:13,290
No.

381
00:23:13,330 --> 00:23:16,010
But it's not my scene, you know?

382
00:23:16,050 --> 00:23:19,410
You should give the idle rich a chance.
They're rather amusing.

383
00:23:41,410 --> 00:23:45,290
- Mary: Who is it?
- It's Charlie Banks.

384
00:23:45,330 --> 00:23:47,490
- Hi.
- Hi. What's up?

385
00:23:47,530 --> 00:23:49,770
Oh, nothing. Work.
What about you?

386
00:23:49,810 --> 00:23:51,690
Yeah, the same, I guess.

387
00:23:51,730 --> 00:23:52,930
- Nia: Hey, Charlie.
- Oh, hey.

388
00:23:52,970 --> 00:23:54,970
So are you doing anything
right now?

389
00:23:55,010 --> 00:23:57,050
I'm reading "Mein Kampf"
in German

390
00:23:57,090 --> 00:23:59,530
and I feel like my head's
about to explode.

391
00:23:59,570 --> 00:24:01,010
You can read German?

392
00:24:01,010 --> 00:24:03,890
Yeah, my maternal grandmother,
the baroness, taught me.

393
00:24:03,890 --> 00:24:05,890
Impresses the hell
out of poli sci professors.

394
00:24:05,930 --> 00:24:07,810
Yeah, I'm sure.

395
00:24:07,890 --> 00:24:10,090
- What's up?
- Wait, a baroness? Really?

396
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:11,530
Yeah, really.

397
00:24:11,570 --> 00:24:13,890
Oh, wow.

398
00:24:13,930 --> 00:24:15,650
So what's going on?

399
00:24:15,690 --> 00:24:17,850
No, nothing. I was just
actually coming by to see

400
00:24:17,890 --> 00:24:20,010
if you wanted to grab
a wienerschnitzel or something.

401
00:24:20,050 --> 00:24:22,730
There's a guy with a tray
on the lawn.

402
00:24:22,770 --> 00:24:24,610
He's only gonna be there
for another 15 minutes.

403
00:24:24,650 --> 00:24:26,250
Mary, you should go.
Go take a break.

404
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:29,450
Yeah, no, I can't.
That's really sweet, Charlie.

405
00:24:29,490 --> 00:24:32,730
I'm just so buried right now.
I'm sorry.

406
00:24:32,770 --> 00:24:35,930
That's cool. I will brush up
on my Germanic delicacies

407
00:24:35,970 --> 00:24:37,290
and I will take
another shot, okay?

408
00:24:37,330 --> 00:24:39,050
- Okay.
- All right.

409
00:24:39,090 --> 00:24:41,290
- I'll see you, Charlie.
- All right. Don't work too hard.

410
00:25:02,650 --> 00:25:05,090
Mick: Yo.

411
00:25:08,130 --> 00:25:09,290
Yo.

412
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,010
Mick Leary.

413
00:25:13,050 --> 00:25:15,650
(drops backpack)

414
00:25:15,690 --> 00:25:18,050
Hey. Charlie Banks.

415
00:25:19,090 --> 00:25:20,970
Yeah, I remember you.

416
00:25:21,010 --> 00:25:22,810
All right.

417
00:25:22,850 --> 00:25:25,250
Boojie, right?
(laughs)

418
00:25:25,330 --> 00:25:27,810
Right?

419
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:29,730
How have you been?

420
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,850
Uh, great.

421
00:25:31,890 --> 00:25:33,250
Yeah.

422
00:25:33,290 --> 00:25:34,770
Cool. You guys got homework?

423
00:25:34,810 --> 00:25:37,050
- Yeah.
- Yeah, we have some reading.

424
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:40,810
All right, no brewing till you're done.
I ain't gonna be bad influence here.

425
00:25:42,890 --> 00:25:45,530
Hey, you know what, Charlie?
You're one lucky motherfucker

426
00:25:45,570 --> 00:25:47,850
you got a roommate
like Danny Bowman.

427
00:25:54,930 --> 00:25:57,170
Where's the head?
I gotta take a piss.

428
00:25:57,210 --> 00:26:01,130
It's down, make a left.
You'll see it on the right.

429
00:26:01,170 --> 00:26:03,770
It's a co-ed bathroom,
just so you know.

430
00:26:03,810 --> 00:26:06,130
Oh, yeah, that's very chic.

431
00:26:09,330 --> 00:26:11,250
What the fuck?

432
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:17,770
I came in from my econ exam
and he was sitting in the lobby waiting.

433
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:20,250
He just came to get out of the city
for a few days.

434
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:22,650
What was wrong with the Poconos?
Why would he come here?

435
00:26:22,690 --> 00:26:25,890
Poconos? What are you talking about?
He'll get bored in a few days and split.

436
00:26:25,930 --> 00:26:27,810
All right? No big deal.

437
00:26:27,890 --> 00:26:30,770
We gotta help him avoid conflict
before he leaves.

438
00:26:30,810 --> 00:26:33,010
Avoid conflict?
Yeah, that shouldn't be--

439
00:26:36,050 --> 00:26:38,250
So whose bed do I get?

440
00:26:38,290 --> 00:26:40,530
He came here to visit you,
not me.

441
00:26:42,930 --> 00:26:45,650
- This one's all right.
- The best.

442
00:26:47,490 --> 00:26:50,090
I'm gonna go to the Wick.
I'll do this reading later.

443
00:26:50,130 --> 00:26:52,490
What?

444
00:26:52,530 --> 00:26:53,770
Fuck!

445
00:26:53,810 --> 00:26:56,570
You know how much your parents
are paying for you to go here?

446
00:26:56,610 --> 00:26:58,210
Yeah.

447
00:26:58,250 --> 00:27:01,090
Okay, well, then sit your ass down
and finish your fucking homework

448
00:27:01,170 --> 00:27:02,930
before you go out drinking.

449
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:18,250
Thank God you're here, Mick.
I could have ruined my entire life.

450
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,250
Yeah, you got that right, booje.

451
00:27:30,730 --> 00:27:34,450
(loud music playing)

452
00:27:34,490 --> 00:27:37,930
Hey, there's your
buddy Leo, Charlie.

453
00:27:37,970 --> 00:27:40,810
No, man, forget it.
You don't want to hang with those guys.

454
00:27:40,850 --> 00:27:44,410
Mick, you're gonna fucking
love this guy, actually.

455
00:27:44,450 --> 00:27:46,010
Danny, what are you doing?

456
00:27:46,050 --> 00:27:48,450
Come on, we'll give the idle rich
another chance.

457
00:27:48,530 --> 00:27:50,730
No, yeah yeah, come on,
he's right.

458
00:27:50,770 --> 00:27:53,970
The idle rich deserve
a second chance.

459
00:27:54,010 --> 00:27:55,970
If they don't,
who does, right?

460
00:27:58,450 --> 00:28:03,130
That's great.
That's just-- that's great.

461
00:28:03,170 --> 00:28:05,170
Hey, are you Italian?

462
00:28:05,210 --> 00:28:07,130
- Irish.
- Irish?

463
00:28:07,170 --> 00:28:10,490
Hey, I'm actually half-Irish,
half-Jewish.

464
00:28:10,530 --> 00:28:12,450
Yeah? So what's that mean?

465
00:28:12,490 --> 00:28:14,730
You get your whiskey wholesale?

466
00:28:14,770 --> 00:28:17,010
(laughs)

467
00:28:17,050 --> 00:28:19,490
That's good.
That's good.

468
00:28:19,530 --> 00:28:21,810
That's really good.
I might steal that from you,

469
00:28:21,850 --> 00:28:23,650
but I will footnote you.

470
00:28:23,690 --> 00:28:25,570
Yeah, right.

471
00:28:27,090 --> 00:28:28,530
Whoa, what the fuck?

472
00:28:28,570 --> 00:28:30,490
Okay okay okay, forget it.

473
00:28:30,530 --> 00:28:32,930
Buzzy Tim, acid casualty.

474
00:28:33,010 --> 00:28:35,730
Buzzy Tim, hey...

475
00:28:35,770 --> 00:28:39,570
Gravity, gravity, gravitas.

476
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:41,570
Gravy.

477
00:28:41,610 --> 00:28:44,650
Thanks, Buzzy.
Thanks, Buzzy.

478
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:46,930
All right, there you go.
There you go.

479
00:28:57,330 --> 00:28:59,370
So you grew up with Danny?

480
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:02,050
And where are you at school?

481
00:29:02,090 --> 00:29:03,970
I'm not.

482
00:29:04,050 --> 00:29:06,250
I've been thinking about
taking some time off myself,

483
00:29:06,290 --> 00:29:08,810
to get some real-world experience
before I graduate.

484
00:29:08,850 --> 00:29:11,050
Yeah, I know what you mean.

485
00:29:11,090 --> 00:29:13,290
I mean, this is a great school,

486
00:29:13,330 --> 00:29:15,450
but it's a little bit
of a culture shock

487
00:29:15,490 --> 00:29:17,970
when you hit the job market.

488
00:29:18,010 --> 00:29:22,210
Hell yeah.
Yeah, it's a culture shock

489
00:29:22,250 --> 00:29:26,210
coming off the--
out of the job market

490
00:29:26,250 --> 00:29:30,010
and sitting here
drinking $2 pitchers

491
00:29:30,050 --> 00:29:33,530
with two smoking girls
like you.

492
00:29:41,650 --> 00:29:45,370
Danny: It's tempting.
It's tempting.

493
00:29:45,410 --> 00:29:47,370
Man: Here you go, guys.

494
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:51,050
This one's interesting.

495
00:29:53,290 --> 00:29:57,770
I want to say something
out of Bukowski or Jim Carroll.

496
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,930
Leo, Leo,

497
00:29:59,970 --> 00:30:02,250
do us all a favor

498
00:30:02,290 --> 00:30:05,050
and just don't say anything.

499
00:30:06,650 --> 00:30:08,570
And I mean that

500
00:30:08,610 --> 00:30:11,970
in the most sincere
and affectionate terms.

501
00:30:12,010 --> 00:30:14,890
Okay? Here you go.
Tobacco.

502
00:30:14,930 --> 00:30:16,210
Thanks, man.

503
00:30:16,250 --> 00:30:17,890
Charlie, finish your shot.
Come here.

504
00:30:17,930 --> 00:30:19,490
- Love you, Charlie.
- All right.

505
00:30:19,530 --> 00:30:22,410
- Cheers. Cheers.
- Okay.

506
00:30:24,970 --> 00:30:27,130
Danny: No fucking way.

507
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:29,410
No. Terry became a florist?

508
00:30:29,450 --> 00:30:31,690
Yeah yeah, he's doing good.

509
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:34,810
His uncle got sick,

510
00:30:34,850 --> 00:30:37,170
so he started
running the store

511
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:39,850
and just kept on working.

512
00:30:39,890 --> 00:30:43,090
Listen, you know I got
love for the guy...

513
00:30:43,130 --> 00:30:44,210
Me too.

514
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:48,610
...but making orders
and changing products--

515
00:30:48,650 --> 00:30:51,410
Yeah, I know, right?
He's a dim fuck.

516
00:30:51,450 --> 00:30:53,810
- But he puts together a nice bouquet.
- Oh, wait. Hang on.

517
00:30:53,850 --> 00:30:55,850
Hey. Hey.

518
00:30:58,690 --> 00:31:01,610
- Charlie.
- What?

519
00:31:03,050 --> 00:31:05,090
That Mary girl is fine, right?

520
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:07,010
Yeah. Danny.

521
00:31:07,090 --> 00:31:09,650
Hey, is she with anyone?

522
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:12,970
Yeah yeah, she's with some--

523
00:31:13,010 --> 00:31:16,490
some older rich Wall Street guy,
I think.

524
00:31:16,530 --> 00:31:20,770
She used to date
John Kennedy, Jr.

525
00:31:20,850 --> 00:31:22,730
How'd she hook up with him?

526
00:31:22,770 --> 00:31:26,250
Her father is a senator
from Connecticut, man.

527
00:31:26,290 --> 00:31:27,610
No shit.

528
00:31:27,650 --> 00:31:29,130
Yeah. Shit yeah.

529
00:31:29,170 --> 00:31:31,450
Whoa.

530
00:31:31,490 --> 00:31:34,290
So I guess she's
out of our league, huh?

531
00:31:34,330 --> 00:31:36,410
Yeah, way.

532
00:31:39,410 --> 00:31:41,610
Oh, hey...

533
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:43,530
(chuckles)

534
00:31:43,570 --> 00:31:45,810
listen, what's a "footnote" mean?

535
00:31:45,850 --> 00:31:48,330
(chuckles)
"Footnote"?

536
00:31:48,370 --> 00:31:50,170
Yeah, "footnote."

537
00:31:50,210 --> 00:31:52,490
"Footnote" means
to give credit to somebody.

538
00:31:55,690 --> 00:31:56,810
- Footnote.
- Yeah.

539
00:31:56,850 --> 00:31:57,930
That's cool.

540
00:32:08,850 --> 00:32:10,290
Yo.

541
00:32:10,330 --> 00:32:13,010
It's good to see you.

542
00:32:14,530 --> 00:32:16,650
It's good to see you too, Mick.

543
00:32:17,970 --> 00:32:20,210
Is this a good school?

544
00:32:20,250 --> 00:32:22,010
Yeah yeah, it's a good school.

545
00:32:22,050 --> 00:32:24,170
That's cool.
Hey, the chicks are fine.

546
00:32:24,210 --> 00:32:25,810
Yeah, they are.

547
00:32:25,850 --> 00:32:29,970
Hey, "Deviant Behavior"--
this shit must be a blast.

548
00:32:30,010 --> 00:32:31,970
I didn't know someone wrote
a book about me.

549
00:32:32,010 --> 00:32:33,970
Mick, go to sleep, all right?

550
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:35,930
Please.

551
00:32:36,930 --> 00:32:40,490
Don't worry about anything.
I'll be out of here in a couple--

552
00:32:40,530 --> 00:32:42,370
Yo yo yo, come on.

553
00:32:42,410 --> 00:32:44,730
Go to sleep.
It's okay.

554
00:32:44,770 --> 00:32:46,690
All right.

555
00:32:48,690 --> 00:32:50,930
Good night, Danny boy.

556
00:32:52,410 --> 00:32:54,490
Good night, Mick.

557
00:33:03,930 --> 00:33:06,090
- (dishes clatter)
- Jesus.

558
00:33:06,130 --> 00:33:09,450
Sneaking out alone to breakfast, huh?
What's up with that?

559
00:33:09,490 --> 00:33:12,210
You and Danny looked so adorable,
I didn't want to wake you guys.

560
00:33:12,250 --> 00:33:14,130
Where is Danny?

561
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,450
He's still sleeping.

562
00:33:16,490 --> 00:33:19,170
Hey, look, it's Mary.

563
00:33:20,650 --> 00:33:22,730
Let's go join her
for breakfast, shall we?

564
00:33:22,770 --> 00:33:24,690
All right.

565
00:33:29,130 --> 00:33:31,490
- Good morning, beautiful.
- Hey, Mick, Charlie.

566
00:33:31,530 --> 00:33:33,610
- Good morning.
- I wish I could sit and eat with you,

567
00:33:33,650 --> 00:33:35,130
but I have to go
hang my photos now.

568
00:33:35,170 --> 00:33:38,530
I should get to the studio. Professor
Aaron will kill me if I don't get there.

569
00:33:38,570 --> 00:33:41,770
- I heard that guy is ruthless.
- He's ruthless and impatient.

570
00:33:41,810 --> 00:33:44,810
But why don't you come
and check it out?

571
00:33:44,850 --> 00:33:46,850
I would love to hear
what you think.

572
00:33:46,890 --> 00:33:49,410
- Yeah yeah, I would love to.
- Okay, great.

573
00:33:49,450 --> 00:33:51,530
- Don't worry. I'll get that.
- Are you sure?

574
00:33:51,570 --> 00:33:53,610
Yeah yeah, we'll get that.
Just leave it.

575
00:33:53,650 --> 00:33:56,250
- I'll see you later then?
- Yeah, definitely.

576
00:33:56,290 --> 00:33:57,770
- Okay, bye.
- Bye.

577
00:34:00,370 --> 00:34:03,370
Charlie: This guys is,
like, depressed

578
00:34:03,410 --> 00:34:05,450
or pissed off.
He's depressing me.

579
00:34:05,490 --> 00:34:07,570
Mary: I'm not sure
I'll show him those either.

580
00:34:07,610 --> 00:34:11,730
Charlie: But these are fantastic.
These are really great.

581
00:34:11,770 --> 00:34:13,450
- You like them?
- Yeah, of course.

582
00:34:13,490 --> 00:34:15,810
You know, they're a lot
like Walker Evans.

583
00:34:15,850 --> 00:34:17,490
Oh, wow. Thanks.

584
00:34:17,530 --> 00:34:20,330
- Yeah.
- Wow.

585
00:34:20,370 --> 00:34:22,250
Who are these fucking people?

586
00:34:22,290 --> 00:34:25,330
They're just regular people--
portraits.

587
00:34:25,370 --> 00:34:28,290
I mean, they're not of celebrities
or serial killers

588
00:34:28,330 --> 00:34:30,250
- like we see all the time.
- Right.

589
00:34:30,290 --> 00:34:32,530
And people actually
buy this stuff?

590
00:34:32,570 --> 00:34:36,170
They're not for sale. They're just
for my Fine Arts requirement.

591
00:34:36,210 --> 00:34:39,290
I don't expect everyone to tell me
I'm the next Walker Evans.

592
00:34:39,330 --> 00:34:41,010
They're great.

593
00:34:41,050 --> 00:34:43,010
Okay.

594
00:34:43,090 --> 00:34:45,490
Regular people, huh?

595
00:34:45,530 --> 00:34:47,930
Hey, you got your camera here?

596
00:34:47,970 --> 00:34:49,370
Sure.

597
00:34:49,410 --> 00:34:51,330
Take a picture
of me and Charlie.

598
00:34:51,370 --> 00:34:53,530
- Okay.
- We're regular, right?

599
00:34:53,570 --> 00:34:55,490
Come on.

600
00:34:56,970 --> 00:34:58,570
Mick: Take this.

601
00:34:58,610 --> 00:35:02,330
Mm, you know what?
The light is better over here.

602
00:35:07,410 --> 00:35:09,010
- Charlie.
- That's all right.

603
00:35:09,050 --> 00:35:10,930
- Come on.
- Come on, Charlie.

604
00:35:10,970 --> 00:35:13,370
- Come on.
- All right, okay.

605
00:35:13,410 --> 00:35:16,490
Let's do it for Mary.

606
00:35:16,530 --> 00:35:18,370
Okay. That's nice of you.

607
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:22,250
- All right. Dude.
- All right, come on.

608
00:35:22,290 --> 00:35:23,770
- Ready?
- Mm-hmm.

609
00:35:24,730 --> 00:35:26,650
One more.

610
00:35:26,690 --> 00:35:28,210
Can I have a smile this time?

611
00:35:28,250 --> 00:35:29,730
- Just one, Charlie.
- Okay.

612
00:35:31,130 --> 00:35:34,210
Thank you.
All right, seriously.

613
00:35:41,650 --> 00:35:43,250
Hey, one more.

614
00:35:50,170 --> 00:35:52,490
(claps)
Charlie!

615
00:36:00,010 --> 00:36:02,650
- Good game.
- Thanks. You too.

616
00:36:02,690 --> 00:36:04,810
You told me that last time.

617
00:36:14,370 --> 00:36:16,210
You want to play?

618
00:36:16,250 --> 00:36:18,210
All right.

619
00:36:25,210 --> 00:36:27,210
- Nice block.
- Thanks.

620
00:36:28,530 --> 00:36:30,490
Nice fucking block.

621
00:36:46,610 --> 00:36:48,250
Charlie: Lucky.

622
00:37:03,530 --> 00:37:08,890
What is Hannah Arendt referring to

623
00:37:08,930 --> 00:37:11,250
with the phrase

624
00:37:11,290 --> 00:37:13,650
"the banality of evil"?

625
00:37:15,490 --> 00:37:17,250
Nia.

626
00:37:17,290 --> 00:37:19,410
Well, she wrote in thinking that

627
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:22,810
"the sad truth is that most evil
is done by people

628
00:37:22,850 --> 00:37:25,890
who never make up their minds
to be either good or evil."

629
00:37:25,930 --> 00:37:28,930
Good.

630
00:37:28,970 --> 00:37:32,970
But what is she
specifically referring to

631
00:37:33,010 --> 00:37:35,450
with the phrase
"the banality of evil"?

632
00:37:35,490 --> 00:37:37,010
Charlie Banks.

633
00:37:37,050 --> 00:37:39,850
She was referring to Eichmann

634
00:37:39,890 --> 00:37:42,290
and the point that he was not
some kind of mad monster,

635
00:37:42,330 --> 00:37:44,170
despite the nature
of his atrocities,

636
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:47,370
but some poor jerk whose
humanity and instincts were dulled

637
00:37:47,410 --> 00:37:49,770
by the massive
bureaucracy of the Nazis.

638
00:37:49,810 --> 00:37:51,890
Yeah.

639
00:37:51,930 --> 00:37:54,210
Yes, but I'd like to take that

640
00:37:54,250 --> 00:37:56,370
down the road
just a little bit

641
00:37:56,410 --> 00:37:58,890
in asking you guys--

642
00:37:58,930 --> 00:38:01,490
what are the truest forms
of evil?

643
00:38:01,530 --> 00:38:03,850
Hang on.

644
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:08,530
And are those forms always the ones
which cause death?

645
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:10,610
What about child molesters?

646
00:38:10,650 --> 00:38:12,450
What else?

647
00:38:12,490 --> 00:38:13,650
Cheap seats.

648
00:38:13,690 --> 00:38:17,010
A rat.

649
00:38:17,050 --> 00:38:19,690
Professor: Why? Betrayal?

650
00:38:19,730 --> 00:38:25,130
Because a rat just
complicates a simple thing.

651
00:38:25,170 --> 00:38:29,290
(bell ringing)

652
00:38:29,330 --> 00:38:31,730
Food for thought, folks.
Food for thought.

653
00:38:39,690 --> 00:38:41,530
- Charlie.
- What?

654
00:38:41,570 --> 00:38:43,650
What's wrong with you?

655
00:38:43,690 --> 00:38:45,770
Nothing.

656
00:38:45,810 --> 00:38:49,130
That was cool.
He's a heavy guy-- Professor Gersten.

657
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,730
Yeah yeah, he's great.

658
00:38:50,770 --> 00:38:52,850
You looked smart in there too.

659
00:38:52,890 --> 00:38:54,810
Thanks, man.

660
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:56,930
Man, if I knew college was gonna be
this interesting,

661
00:38:56,970 --> 00:38:59,410
I might have paid a little bit more
attention in school.

662
00:38:59,450 --> 00:39:01,410
Why didn't you?

663
00:39:02,810 --> 00:39:05,010
Schoolwork wasn't a priority
in my house.

664
00:39:05,050 --> 00:39:06,970
No? What was?

665
00:39:07,010 --> 00:39:10,370
Hey, who are you,
the Spanish fucking Inquisition?

666
00:39:10,450 --> 00:39:11,850
Huh?

667
00:39:11,890 --> 00:39:14,730
Curious fucking George--
that's you, right?

668
00:39:19,050 --> 00:39:21,730
Now that little bastard was always
getting into some fucked-up shit,

669
00:39:21,770 --> 00:39:23,850
wasn't he, instead of minding
his own fucking business?

670
00:39:23,890 --> 00:39:25,290
Yeah.

671
00:39:27,410 --> 00:39:30,050
My mother used to read it to me

672
00:39:30,090 --> 00:39:32,610
when I used to go visit her.

673
00:39:37,570 --> 00:39:40,170
You're just dying to ask me
where I went to go visit her,

674
00:39:40,210 --> 00:39:41,970
aren't you, Charlie?

675
00:39:42,010 --> 00:39:43,490
Yeah, it crossed my mind.

676
00:39:43,570 --> 00:39:45,570
- Oh oh, it did cross your mind?
- Yeah.

677
00:39:45,610 --> 00:39:48,890
That's hysterical.
It crossed your mind

678
00:39:48,930 --> 00:39:52,570
like a little baby duck crossing
the road to go swimming in the pond?

679
00:39:52,610 --> 00:39:54,890
You know, fuck you.

680
00:39:59,770 --> 00:40:02,250
Quack quack, Charlie.
Come on, let's get something to eat.

681
00:40:02,290 --> 00:40:03,890
I'm starving.

682
00:40:13,530 --> 00:40:16,210
That's embarrassing.

683
00:40:16,250 --> 00:40:20,130
Sorry to do this to you,
but I have nothing, actually.

684
00:40:20,210 --> 00:40:22,970
You are seriously the worst
fucking poker player.

685
00:40:23,010 --> 00:40:26,610
- Charlie, you really do suck.
- I exaggerate a little bit.

686
00:40:26,650 --> 00:40:28,370
It's a good thing you don't have
a trust fund.

687
00:40:28,410 --> 00:40:31,210
- Yeah, good thing, huh, Daddy?
- A great thing.

688
00:40:31,250 --> 00:40:34,530
Hey, where did you learn
how to play cards?

689
00:40:34,610 --> 00:40:36,490
You're throwing money away here.

690
00:40:36,530 --> 00:40:39,410
I learned downtown
with wiseguys.

691
00:40:39,410 --> 00:40:41,410
Downtown with Fat Tommy?

692
00:40:41,450 --> 00:40:44,210
Fat Tommy and Uncle Joe.

693
00:40:44,250 --> 00:40:46,610
- That's where you're from?
- That's where I'm from.

694
00:40:46,650 --> 00:40:48,730
You don't look like
a wiseguy to me.

695
00:40:48,770 --> 00:40:51,010
Yeah? What's a wiseguy
look like?

696
00:40:51,050 --> 00:40:53,250
Your friend Mick.

697
00:40:53,290 --> 00:40:56,610
My friend Mick. Have you ever
been to New York City, Antigone?

698
00:40:56,650 --> 00:40:59,210
You know what? I like this.
This is really adorable.

699
00:40:59,250 --> 00:41:00,930
- Shut the fuck up.
- No. Right, Mary?

700
00:41:00,970 --> 00:41:02,770
You're pretty cute.

701
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:04,490
Excuse me.

702
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,250
Get out of here,
you broccoli head.

703
00:41:08,650 --> 00:41:10,210
Find anything?

704
00:41:10,250 --> 00:41:13,250
Oh, hey. No no, not at all.
Nothing I really want.

705
00:41:13,290 --> 00:41:14,730
Tell me about it.

706
00:41:14,770 --> 00:41:16,410
How does he even
live this way?

707
00:41:16,450 --> 00:41:20,690
Leo's life is unimaginable
for anyone except Leo.

708
00:41:20,730 --> 00:41:22,570
Yeah, you're right.
Yeah, exactly.

709
00:41:22,610 --> 00:41:24,530
It does seem to work
for him, though.

710
00:41:26,250 --> 00:41:29,210
So tell me about Mick.

711
00:41:29,250 --> 00:41:31,530
Mick?

712
00:41:31,570 --> 00:41:35,650
You know what? I don't even know
what he's been up to recently.

713
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:39,370
He's cool

714
00:41:39,410 --> 00:41:42,450
but different, you know?

715
00:41:42,490 --> 00:41:44,930
Yeah. No, he's definitely--

716
00:41:45,010 --> 00:41:47,530
he's definitely different.

717
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:48,970
What?

718
00:41:53,370 --> 00:41:54,690
What?

719
00:41:54,730 --> 00:41:56,010
Nothing.

720
00:41:56,050 --> 00:41:58,210
Charlie, what?
Are you holding out on me?

721
00:41:58,250 --> 00:42:01,730
Actually, I have to go
to the bathroom. Excuse me.

722
00:42:03,130 --> 00:42:05,730
- You're adorable when you sulk.
- Fuck you.

723
00:42:10,370 --> 00:42:12,970
- Sorry, I was looking for the bathroom.
- Hey, come here.

724
00:42:13,010 --> 00:42:14,930
- Look at this.
- Yeah.

725
00:42:14,970 --> 00:42:16,410
How great is this, huh?

726
00:42:16,450 --> 00:42:18,090
Jesus. Yeah.

727
00:42:18,130 --> 00:42:20,730
I'm very adaptable,
or so I've been told.

728
00:42:20,770 --> 00:42:23,050
Ooh, wait.

729
00:42:23,090 --> 00:42:25,250
- Here, take these. Put them on.
- Oh, shit.

730
00:42:25,290 --> 00:42:28,970
They're plain glass. Some drama major
left them here one morning,

731
00:42:29,010 --> 00:42:31,370
hoping that I'd invite her back
to retrieve 'em.

732
00:42:31,410 --> 00:42:33,130
That's amazing.

733
00:42:33,170 --> 00:42:35,090
It's pretty good.

734
00:42:35,090 --> 00:42:36,930
You know,
no one would ever know.

735
00:42:36,970 --> 00:42:38,890
Know what?

736
00:42:38,930 --> 00:42:40,810
Oh, that he wasn't--

737
00:42:40,850 --> 00:42:43,050
you know,
that he wasn't some--

738
00:42:43,090 --> 00:42:47,050
I mean, that you weren't
some preppy kid from Connecticut.

739
00:42:48,610 --> 00:42:51,570
Take these, actually.
Take it all.

740
00:42:51,610 --> 00:42:53,770
I'm into a new thing anyway.

741
00:42:53,810 --> 00:42:56,290
So if you only pack for a weekend,
you might as well

742
00:42:56,330 --> 00:42:58,650
have some things
if you stay for a bit, huh?

743
00:42:58,690 --> 00:43:00,930
- All right. Thanks, man.
- Mary: Your deal, Leo.

744
00:43:00,970 --> 00:43:03,570
Yes, I'm coming.

745
00:43:06,970 --> 00:43:10,130
You have a tie as a belt.

746
00:43:10,170 --> 00:43:12,610
Yes, it's the new thing.

747
00:43:12,650 --> 00:43:14,490
All right.

748
00:43:14,530 --> 00:43:16,130
Hey, what's wrong?
You losing again?

749
00:43:16,170 --> 00:43:18,570
Yeah, every hand.

750
00:43:20,250 --> 00:43:22,170
- Sit down.
- Yeah?

751
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:23,970
- Yeah.
- All right.

752
00:43:25,970 --> 00:43:27,850
It's all in the eyes.

753
00:43:27,890 --> 00:43:32,090
I'm telling you. You know
why no one ever calls my hand?

754
00:43:32,130 --> 00:43:33,890
Why?

755
00:43:33,930 --> 00:43:38,530
Because I have
a royal straight flush

756
00:43:38,570 --> 00:43:40,810
working every time
right here.

757
00:43:44,210 --> 00:43:46,490
- Let's see it.
- What?

758
00:43:46,530 --> 00:43:48,450
Give me four aces, Charlie.
You can do it.

759
00:43:48,490 --> 00:43:50,090
- No, man.
- Hey, you want to win or not?

760
00:43:50,130 --> 00:43:52,570
- Yeah. All right.
- All right, let's see it.

761
00:43:52,610 --> 00:43:54,410
All right. How's this?

762
00:43:56,370 --> 00:43:58,530
Wrong. No, you see,

763
00:43:58,570 --> 00:44:01,970
you're telling me
how dangerous you are,

764
00:44:02,010 --> 00:44:05,290
but you want to dare me
to find out for myself.

765
00:44:05,330 --> 00:44:07,570
Right. Okay, yeah, that's right.

766
00:44:07,610 --> 00:44:09,930
All right. Okay, all right.

767
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:11,970
How's this?

768
00:44:13,450 --> 00:44:16,210
Now you look like you're
confused or something.

769
00:44:16,250 --> 00:44:17,770
I feel confused.

770
00:44:17,810 --> 00:44:19,810
Right, yeah yeah.
Well, it shows.

771
00:44:19,890 --> 00:44:21,770
Just...

772
00:44:25,090 --> 00:44:27,370
- Keep working on it. Yeah.
- Yeah?

773
00:44:27,410 --> 00:44:30,730
(sighs)

774
00:44:30,770 --> 00:44:33,130
I feel like a new man.

775
00:44:35,250 --> 00:44:36,970
Mary: Wow, you look good.

776
00:44:37,010 --> 00:44:39,170
Mick: Yes, thank you, thank you.
I'll have to footnote you.

777
00:44:39,210 --> 00:44:41,090
Charlie: Man, Nia's great.
You know you like her.

778
00:44:41,170 --> 00:44:43,250
Mick: Yeah, seriously,
what the fuck is your problem?

779
00:44:43,290 --> 00:44:45,410
Charlie: He's got this insane
romantic xenophobia.

780
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:47,170
What the fuck does that mean?

781
00:44:47,210 --> 00:44:50,530
You know, she says "to-may-to"
and he says "to-mah-to."

782
00:44:50,610 --> 00:44:52,970
What the hell are you
talking about?

783
00:44:53,010 --> 00:44:54,650
To-mah-toes.

784
00:44:54,690 --> 00:44:58,410
You're like a bunch of fucking girls.
Shut up.

785
00:44:58,450 --> 00:45:00,490
Charlie: Okay. I think
he's retarded, seriously.

786
00:45:00,530 --> 00:45:03,010
I gotta take a leak.

787
00:45:03,050 --> 00:45:06,770
(police radio chatter,
car passes by)

788
00:45:27,370 --> 00:45:29,250
I can't go when you guys
are watching me.

789
00:45:29,330 --> 00:45:31,650
Charlie is a pervert.

790
00:45:34,130 --> 00:45:36,170
- Hey.
- Hey.

791
00:45:36,210 --> 00:45:39,450
How much did you end up winning
in the last couple of hours?

792
00:45:39,490 --> 00:45:41,130
50 bucks.

793
00:45:41,170 --> 00:45:42,890
Yeah?

794
00:45:42,930 --> 00:45:45,410
- Yeah.
- Good for you.

795
00:45:45,450 --> 00:45:48,170
Hey, why do you think
Mick was hiding from the cops?

796
00:45:49,970 --> 00:45:51,530
I don't know.

797
00:45:51,570 --> 00:45:55,050
It's probably that old
paranoia, you know?

798
00:45:55,090 --> 00:45:58,250
You know, Mick just gets weird
around cops.

799
00:45:58,290 --> 00:46:01,090
Yeah, probably.

800
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:16,130
(coughs)

801
00:46:17,890 --> 00:46:20,970
Hey. I'm tired.

802
00:46:34,290 --> 00:46:36,490
- Hey, Charlie.
- Hi.

803
00:46:36,530 --> 00:46:39,290
- What are you working on?
- I got a paper due on "Gatsby."

804
00:46:39,330 --> 00:46:41,250
Oh, God, I love that book.

805
00:46:41,290 --> 00:46:43,170
Yeah, I know, the ending
kills me, though.

806
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:44,970
You knew it was coming
the first time you read it.

807
00:46:45,010 --> 00:46:48,170
Yeah, I know, but that's what
makes it so wonderfully tragic.

808
00:46:48,210 --> 00:46:51,370
Right right. It's inevitable,
but you hope against hope.

809
00:46:51,410 --> 00:46:52,690
Yeah.

810
00:46:52,730 --> 00:46:56,250
Hey, want to join our little
study club?

811
00:46:56,290 --> 00:46:58,810
No, thanks.
I gotta get to work.

812
00:46:58,850 --> 00:47:00,770
But you kids have fun.

813
00:47:08,290 --> 00:47:10,650
Hey. Hey. Hey.

814
00:47:10,690 --> 00:47:12,610
- What?
- What are you doing?

815
00:47:12,650 --> 00:47:14,170
- (gasps)
- Stop.

816
00:47:14,210 --> 00:47:17,290
- Mary, did you tag the library?
- Stop. Stop.

817
00:47:17,330 --> 00:47:21,530
- Does this say your name?
- If you write my name, I'll kill you.

818
00:47:21,570 --> 00:47:26,250
Mick, stop, please.
(laughing)

819
00:47:26,290 --> 00:47:28,330
- That's not funny.
- You're gonna get into trouble.

820
00:47:28,370 --> 00:47:30,290
Stop. I can't believe you did that.

821
00:47:30,330 --> 00:47:33,250
I didn't do that.
It says "Mary" right there.

822
00:47:33,290 --> 00:47:35,210
What are you doing?

823
00:47:35,250 --> 00:47:36,890
How do you explain the pen
in your bag?

824
00:47:36,930 --> 00:47:39,330
Come here. You look ridiculous.

825
00:47:41,650 --> 00:47:45,810
- All right, pay attention.
- Okay.

826
00:47:47,090 --> 00:47:49,090
Make sure this is straight.

827
00:47:49,130 --> 00:47:51,010
Okay.

828
00:47:51,090 --> 00:47:52,810
Loop that with that. There.

829
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:54,770
Just make sure it stays even.

830
00:47:54,810 --> 00:47:56,250
You look good.

831
00:47:57,290 --> 00:47:59,530
Leo: I hope that ride wasn't
too bad for you.

832
00:47:59,570 --> 00:48:03,330
- Charlie: It was great.
- Let's begin flight preboarding

833
00:48:03,370 --> 00:48:06,890
for any passengers suffering
from severe sexual longing,

834
00:48:06,930 --> 00:48:11,930
free-floating anxiety, depression,
alcoholism, inertia,

835
00:48:11,970 --> 00:48:14,450
turpitude, messianic fantasies,

836
00:48:14,490 --> 00:48:17,650
and any of the other top 40
personality crises.

837
00:48:17,690 --> 00:48:20,050
Sir, please be careful
with the clubs.

838
00:48:24,970 --> 00:48:26,930
- Oh, thank you very much.
- You're welcome.

839
00:48:26,970 --> 00:48:28,450
(thunder crashing)

840
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:31,330
(engine starts)

841
00:48:35,410 --> 00:48:37,530
Charlie's voice: Leo realized
he accidentally attended

842
00:48:37,570 --> 00:48:41,410
all of his classes that week and decided
that we all needed to go on a road trip

843
00:48:41,490 --> 00:48:43,490
on his plane--

844
00:48:43,530 --> 00:48:45,970
his private plane.

845
00:49:06,770 --> 00:49:08,250
Thank you.

846
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:10,930
God, I can smell those martinis.

847
00:49:18,250 --> 00:49:20,530
(seagulls cawing)

848
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:28,690
Mick: Do you know
how to play this game?

849
00:49:28,730 --> 00:49:30,650
Charlie: Not really.

850
00:49:30,690 --> 00:49:32,930
Mick: They're all good at this shit.

851
00:49:32,970 --> 00:49:35,170
Charlie: Yeah, they're all rich.

852
00:49:35,210 --> 00:49:37,730
Rich people are good
at shit like this.

853
00:49:37,770 --> 00:49:40,090
Mick: Fucking rich people.

854
00:49:40,130 --> 00:49:42,570
Charlie: Yeah.

855
00:49:44,210 --> 00:49:46,170
You want to play?

856
00:49:47,890 --> 00:49:49,650
I don't know.

857
00:49:50,770 --> 00:49:54,370
It seems so... gay.

858
00:49:54,410 --> 00:49:56,050
(Charlie chuckles)

859
00:49:56,090 --> 00:49:58,730
Man, it's a goof--
you'll be back in the city soon

860
00:49:58,770 --> 00:50:01,930
and you'll reminisce about that time

861
00:50:01,970 --> 00:50:04,250
you played croquet
with your friends.

862
00:50:04,290 --> 00:50:06,530
Maybe you'll crack
a little smile.

863
00:50:08,410 --> 00:50:10,970
That's some funny shit, Charlie.

864
00:50:12,450 --> 00:50:14,730
Seriously, you're killing me.

865
00:50:21,210 --> 00:50:23,130
Come on.

866
00:50:27,770 --> 00:50:30,490
All right, who wants
to get their balls smacked?

867
00:50:39,450 --> 00:50:42,290
I think you might want
to get it through there.

868
00:51:56,570 --> 00:52:00,010
Danny: Were Charlie and Mary
out there alone together?

869
00:52:00,050 --> 00:52:02,370
Yes, they were.

870
00:52:02,410 --> 00:52:04,490
I was watching them
this whole time.

871
00:52:04,530 --> 00:52:06,250
Hmm.

872
00:52:06,290 --> 00:52:09,810
Can you imagine the fucking fireworks
going off in his head?

873
00:52:12,770 --> 00:52:14,410
Your turn.

874
00:52:14,450 --> 00:52:17,930
You know, I've never been naked

875
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:20,210
in a hot tub with a girl before.

876
00:52:22,170 --> 00:52:25,770
Well, I've never been naked
in a hot tub with a guy before.

877
00:52:26,930 --> 00:52:28,250
Hmm.

878
00:52:37,770 --> 00:52:39,650
Are you looking
for owls, Charlie?

879
00:52:39,730 --> 00:52:41,850
No, I'm trying not to stare
at your breasts.

880
00:52:41,890 --> 00:52:44,530
Oh, you are
a true gentleman.

881
00:52:44,570 --> 00:52:47,250
Actually, if I wasn't the only one
in here with you,

882
00:52:47,290 --> 00:52:48,930
I'd probably be sneaking
some looks.

883
00:52:48,970 --> 00:52:50,490
Hmm, honest too.

884
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:52,130
Thank you.

885
00:52:52,170 --> 00:52:54,170
And adorable.

886
00:52:54,210 --> 00:52:56,730
You're blushing.

887
00:52:56,770 --> 00:52:58,330
I'm not blushing.

888
00:52:58,370 --> 00:52:59,810
Or is it the steam?

889
00:52:59,890 --> 00:53:01,770
- Yeah, I think it's the steam.
- Of course.

890
00:53:01,810 --> 00:53:04,210
I don't know.
I think I'm drunk, actually.

891
00:53:04,250 --> 00:53:06,170
(chuckles)

892
00:53:06,210 --> 00:53:08,450
Why are you fucking with me?

893
00:53:08,490 --> 00:53:10,650
I'm not fucking with you.

894
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:15,810
Can I be totally honest with you?

895
00:53:15,850 --> 00:53:17,730
- Sure.
- Okay.

896
00:53:17,770 --> 00:53:21,770
When I am alone at night

897
00:53:21,810 --> 00:53:26,330
and I'm with myself--

898
00:53:26,370 --> 00:53:30,530
I'm giving myself
the gift of pleasure--

899
00:53:30,570 --> 00:53:32,210
When you're jerking off.

900
00:53:32,250 --> 00:53:35,530
Exactly. When I am jerking off,

901
00:53:35,570 --> 00:53:38,330
I am thinking of you

902
00:53:38,370 --> 00:53:41,370
reciting "Mein Kampf"

903
00:53:41,410 --> 00:53:45,250
it its super-sexy mother tongue

904
00:53:45,290 --> 00:53:47,170
while we're making
the sweetest love

905
00:53:47,250 --> 00:53:49,410
we can possibly make
without dying.

906
00:53:51,250 --> 00:53:53,450
Do I need help?

907
00:53:53,490 --> 00:53:56,090
(laughs)
Now you're fucking with me.

908
00:53:56,130 --> 00:53:58,530
- All right, fine. Now we're even.
- Good.

909
00:54:01,370 --> 00:54:05,450
You slay me, Charlie,
you really do.

910
00:54:07,810 --> 00:54:09,770
What the hell are you doing
with him, Mary?

911
00:54:13,250 --> 00:54:15,290
- Hey.
- Hey.

912
00:54:15,330 --> 00:54:19,130
- What the hell is going on in here?
- A big sex orgy. Jump in.

913
00:54:27,570 --> 00:54:30,770
It's fucking hot in here.

914
00:54:30,810 --> 00:54:33,730
You didn't piss in the water,
did you, Charlie?

915
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:48,970
Hey, buddy.
How are you doing?

916
00:54:48,970 --> 00:54:50,930
- You want winners?
- No.

917
00:54:50,970 --> 00:54:52,890
Nia: Do you want a gun?

918
00:54:52,930 --> 00:54:54,650
No.

919
00:54:54,690 --> 00:54:56,490
Do you want a kiss?

920
00:54:56,530 --> 00:54:58,330
Fuck you. Good night.

921
00:54:58,370 --> 00:55:00,330
Fuck me? Hey.

922
00:55:01,330 --> 00:55:05,570
Don't let his bookish quality fool you.
Charlie Banks is a surly bitch.

923
00:55:09,050 --> 00:55:10,970
I love that kid.

924
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:24,730
You're so fine.

925
00:55:28,850 --> 00:55:30,450
Are you okay?

926
00:55:42,850 --> 00:55:46,730
Hey, you ever think about
how one little decision you make

927
00:55:46,770 --> 00:55:49,050
can turn day into night
and night into day,

928
00:55:49,090 --> 00:55:51,890
and suddenly everything is different
just 'cause you decided

929
00:55:51,930 --> 00:55:54,050
to go north instead of south?

930
00:55:54,090 --> 00:55:58,090
North or south doesn't make
a difference to me.

931
00:55:58,090 --> 00:56:03,330
It's more about the adventures
along the way.

932
00:56:04,730 --> 00:56:06,650
To where?

933
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:11,770
You have the most
beautiful eyes, Mick.

934
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:41,490
You're not asleep, are you?

935
00:56:41,530 --> 00:56:43,850
Yeah. No no.

936
00:56:43,890 --> 00:56:46,730
I couldn't sleep either.

937
00:56:46,770 --> 00:56:48,930
I know.

938
00:57:07,050 --> 00:57:09,090
It's fucking beautiful, isn't it?

939
00:57:09,130 --> 00:57:11,330
Yeah.

940
00:57:12,770 --> 00:57:16,530
I've been staring out the window
almost all night.

941
00:57:16,570 --> 00:57:18,850
(chuckles) Yeah.

942
00:57:18,890 --> 00:57:23,170
Yeah, 'cause you're scared
if you close your eyes

943
00:57:23,250 --> 00:57:25,450
it's not gonna be there
when you get up, huh?

944
00:57:33,890 --> 00:57:36,170
A rock and a hard place, Charlie.

945
00:57:39,930 --> 00:57:42,650
I guess I'm the only one
who can screw things up, right?

946
00:57:42,690 --> 00:57:44,610
Mm-hmm.

947
00:57:44,650 --> 00:57:46,570
Yeah.

948
00:57:51,370 --> 00:57:53,930
Fucking rich people.

949
00:57:54,930 --> 00:57:58,410
Yeah, fucking rich people.

950
00:58:38,290 --> 00:58:40,210
(camera shutter clicks)

951
00:58:41,570 --> 00:58:42,930
Hi.

952
00:58:42,970 --> 00:58:44,730
What's up?

953
00:58:44,770 --> 00:58:46,850
You look so hale and hardy.

954
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,450
Do l?

955
00:58:48,490 --> 00:58:50,850
You made me think of my father's
favorite quote?

956
00:58:50,890 --> 00:58:52,170
What was it?

957
00:58:52,170 --> 00:58:54,410
"Inflamed with the study of learning

958
00:58:54,450 --> 00:58:57,690
and the admiration of virtue;
stirred up with high hopes

959
00:58:57,730 --> 00:59:00,330
of living to be brave men,
and worthy patriots,

960
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:03,090
dear to God,
and famous to all ages."

961
00:59:03,130 --> 00:59:06,410
Really? I could have sworn
I was drooling all over myself.

962
00:59:06,410 --> 00:59:08,690
Well, you developed some amazing
croquet skills in one weekend.

963
00:59:08,730 --> 00:59:10,410
- That's pretty tough.
- Yeah, thanks.

964
00:59:10,410 --> 00:59:12,930
Who's the quote from?

965
00:59:12,970 --> 00:59:14,850
Milton.

966
00:59:16,170 --> 00:59:19,290
My father always dredges it up
when we fight

967
00:59:19,330 --> 00:59:21,650
about the kind of men
that I date.

968
00:59:25,330 --> 00:59:27,210
Thanks, Charlie.

969
00:59:38,090 --> 00:59:39,850
Charlie's voice:
Sitting there on the lawn,

970
00:59:39,890 --> 00:59:42,290
watching Mick immerse himself
in great literature,

971
00:59:42,330 --> 00:59:45,130
I realized I wasn't
scared of him anymore.

972
00:59:48,050 --> 00:59:50,450
I almost felt it was my duty
to protect him.

973
00:59:56,930 --> 00:59:59,210
A few days
after we got back to campus

974
00:59:59,210 --> 01:00:02,210
Leo bought himself a boat.

975
01:00:02,250 --> 01:00:04,610
And then things really changed.

976
01:00:04,690 --> 01:00:06,570
Fantastic.

977
01:00:06,610 --> 01:00:07,890
Charlie.

978
01:00:07,930 --> 01:00:09,890
Mary: Oh, Leo.

979
01:00:11,050 --> 01:00:14,370
Wow, there she is-- 1951, baby.

980
01:00:14,410 --> 01:00:17,610
You know, Charlie, I believe
I've finally fallen in love.

981
01:00:17,650 --> 01:00:20,250
I believe I've found my passion.

982
01:00:20,290 --> 01:00:23,490
Yeah? She's a bit wooden, Leo,
so she's right up your alley.

983
01:00:23,530 --> 01:00:25,890
You're a bitter one,
Charlie Banks.

984
01:00:25,930 --> 01:00:28,170
- Mary, what do you think?
- I think you're insane.

985
01:00:28,210 --> 01:00:31,210
Thank you. Mick.

986
01:00:31,250 --> 01:00:33,530
Hey, how much did you pay
for this thing?

987
01:00:33,570 --> 01:00:36,210
Well, it would be gauche to answer,

988
01:00:36,250 --> 01:00:38,170
but I will anyway--

989
01:00:38,210 --> 01:00:41,490
200 grand.

990
01:00:41,530 --> 01:00:43,490
Holy shit.

991
01:00:44,490 --> 01:00:46,570
(seagulls cawing)

992
01:01:02,970 --> 01:01:05,210
Hey, yo, Charlie boy,

993
01:01:05,250 --> 01:01:07,690
come take a hit off this.

994
01:01:07,730 --> 01:01:09,650
No, thanks.

995
01:01:09,690 --> 01:01:11,610
Hey, are you feeling blue?

996
01:01:11,650 --> 01:01:13,570
I'd say green.

997
01:01:13,610 --> 01:01:15,930
Don't go overboard, Charlie.

998
01:01:15,970 --> 01:01:18,530
Yeah, 'cause it's fucking cold
in that water

999
01:01:18,570 --> 01:01:20,570
and I'm not jumping in after your ass
if you do.

1000
01:01:22,090 --> 01:01:24,290
You are adorable, Mick.

1001
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:26,570
You know that?
You really are.

1002
01:01:26,570 --> 01:01:28,530
Leo: You are adorable.

1003
01:01:31,690 --> 01:01:34,610
Charlie's voice: The spring formal
was one of those lame college things

1004
01:01:34,650 --> 01:01:37,090
we all looked down on
and could happily have blown off.

1005
01:01:37,130 --> 01:01:39,370
But Mick wouldn't hear of it.

1006
01:01:39,410 --> 01:01:41,650
He'd even gone into town
and rented himself a tux

1007
01:01:41,690 --> 01:01:44,210
and chastised all of us
for lacking school spirit.

1008
01:01:45,930 --> 01:01:47,850
But we had to sneak in.

1009
01:01:47,890 --> 01:01:50,090
See, despite the fact
that Leo dropped 200 grand

1010
01:01:50,130 --> 01:01:52,010
on a boat a few days before,
he was adamant

1011
01:01:52,050 --> 01:01:54,850
that none of us should pay
20 bucks to get into a dance.

1012
01:01:54,890 --> 01:01:57,610
He'd never paid before
and he wasn't about to start

1013
01:01:57,610 --> 01:02:00,290
in his fifth and potentially final
year of college.

1014
01:02:00,330 --> 01:02:02,650
I'm not sure he even caught
the irony.

1015
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:05,170
Fucking rich people.

1016
01:02:05,210 --> 01:02:07,850
(disco music playing)

1017
01:02:07,890 --> 01:02:10,730
¶ Me and you ¶

1018
01:02:10,730 --> 01:02:12,850
¶ And do the things ¶

1019
01:02:12,890 --> 01:02:15,050
¶ Ah, do the things ¶

1020
01:02:15,090 --> 01:02:17,930
¶ That we like to do ¶

1021
01:02:17,970 --> 01:02:21,010
¶ Oh, do a little dance ¶

1022
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:23,050
¶ Make a little love ¶

1023
01:02:23,090 --> 01:02:27,130
¶ Get down tonight,
get down tonight ¶

1024
01:02:27,170 --> 01:02:29,290
¶ Do a little dance ¶

1025
01:02:29,330 --> 01:02:31,330
¶ Make a little love ¶

1026
01:02:31,370 --> 01:02:35,370
¶ Get down tonight,
get down tonight ¶

1027
01:02:35,410 --> 01:02:37,450
¶ Baby ¶

1028
01:02:37,490 --> 01:02:39,570
¶ I'll meet you ¶

1029
01:02:39,610 --> 01:02:43,650
¶ Same place, same time ¶

1030
01:02:43,690 --> 01:02:47,650
¶ Where we can
get together ¶

1031
01:02:47,690 --> 01:02:51,010
¶ And ease up our mind ¶

1032
01:02:51,050 --> 01:02:54,090
¶ Oh, do a little dance ¶

1033
01:02:54,130 --> 01:02:56,130
¶ Make a little love ¶

1034
01:02:56,170 --> 01:03:00,210
¶ Get down tonight,
get down tonight ¶

1035
01:03:00,250 --> 01:03:02,410
¶ Do a little dance ¶

1036
01:03:02,410 --> 01:03:04,930
¶ Make a little love,
get down tonight... ¶

1037
01:03:04,970 --> 01:03:07,330
Charlie's voice: Unfortunately,
the trick to sneaking into

1038
01:03:07,370 --> 01:03:09,530
the spring formal was finding
somebody who had a key

1039
01:03:09,570 --> 01:03:11,570
to that back entrance
of the student center--

1040
01:03:14,290 --> 01:03:16,330
specifically, somebody eager
to curry favor

1041
01:03:16,370 --> 01:03:18,650
with dashing ne'er-do-well
Leo Reilly.

1042
01:03:20,490 --> 01:03:22,690
Oh, poor Michelle.

1043
01:03:26,770 --> 01:03:28,690
- Hey.
- (chuckles)

1044
01:03:28,730 --> 01:03:30,690
Want a drink?

1045
01:03:31,770 --> 01:03:35,170
Can I get that key back, Leo--
the key?

1046
01:03:35,210 --> 01:03:37,090
- Can I get it back?
- Oh.

1047
01:03:37,130 --> 01:03:41,010
I'm not sure I have it right now,
Michelle.

1048
01:03:41,050 --> 01:03:43,410
Can I give it to you
later, Michelle?

1049
01:03:43,450 --> 01:03:45,370
Make sure, though,

1050
01:03:45,410 --> 01:03:48,770
because if I lose that key,
I'll lose my job.

1051
01:03:48,810 --> 01:03:51,010
And I really need that job.

1052
01:03:51,050 --> 01:03:52,770
Okay.

1053
01:03:52,810 --> 01:03:54,450
I'll give it to you later.

1054
01:03:54,490 --> 01:03:56,130
- Okay.
- I promise.

1055
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:57,570
But please?

1056
01:03:57,610 --> 01:04:00,050
Hey, Leo, you're going to hell.

1057
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:03,290
Seriously, there's nothing worse

1058
01:04:03,330 --> 01:04:06,330
than playing with a desperate
girl's heart. What are you doing?

1059
01:04:06,370 --> 01:04:07,570
You got no shame, Leo.

1060
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:09,770
Hey, wait a minute.
I thought that was a good thing.

1061
01:04:09,770 --> 01:04:11,850
What?

1062
01:04:14,090 --> 01:04:19,050
¶ My love must be a kind
of blind love ¶

1063
01:04:22,530 --> 01:04:26,290
¶ I can't see anyone but you ¶

1064
01:04:28,330 --> 01:04:30,930
¶ Shoo-bop shoo-bop ¶

1065
01:04:32,290 --> 01:04:34,210
¶ Shoo-bop shoo-bop ¶

1066
01:04:35,970 --> 01:04:38,730
¶ Shoo-bop shoo-bop ¶

1067
01:04:40,330 --> 01:04:42,650
¶ Shoo-bop shoo-bop ¶

1068
01:04:44,330 --> 01:04:48,010
¶ Shoo-bop shoo-bop,
all the stars... ¶

1069
01:05:33,850 --> 01:05:36,130
- Hey.
- Danny boy.

1070
01:05:38,050 --> 01:05:40,370
Hey, I'm looking for Charlie.
Have you seen him anywhere?

1071
01:05:40,410 --> 01:05:43,810
Yeah, I was just talking to him.
He's in there. He's sulking.

1072
01:05:43,850 --> 01:05:45,450
Why?

1073
01:05:48,810 --> 01:05:51,290
You're fucking the girl
he's in love with.

1074
01:05:51,330 --> 01:05:53,050
All right, I gotta talk to him.

1075
01:05:53,090 --> 01:05:55,570
- No no no, talk to me.
- I'm gonna talk to Charlie, seriously.

1076
01:05:55,610 --> 01:05:58,330
What are you doing, Mick?
We'll go dance.

1077
01:05:58,370 --> 01:06:00,330
I'm not gonna fucking
dance with you.

1078
01:06:00,370 --> 01:06:03,090
No, seriously.

1079
01:06:04,490 --> 01:06:06,730
I'm drunk.

1080
01:06:06,770 --> 01:06:09,130
But-- but--

1081
01:06:11,090 --> 01:06:14,130
What are you gonna do, Mick?

1082
01:06:14,170 --> 01:06:17,010
I mean, what are you doing here?

1083
01:06:17,050 --> 01:06:18,970
Are you telling me
you want me to leave?

1084
01:06:19,010 --> 01:06:20,730
No.

1085
01:06:20,770 --> 01:06:22,770
No no no, I just--

1086
01:06:33,810 --> 01:06:34,930
Hi.

1087
01:06:38,210 --> 01:06:40,330
I got an idea.

1088
01:06:40,330 --> 01:06:42,570
What?

1089
01:06:43,890 --> 01:06:47,210
You're gonna think
I'm losing my shit.

1090
01:06:47,210 --> 01:06:49,450
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1091
01:06:49,490 --> 01:06:51,730
Why? What is it?

1092
01:06:52,890 --> 01:06:55,730
Okay, so, like,

1093
01:06:55,770 --> 01:06:57,210
I look at this--

1094
01:06:57,250 --> 01:06:59,690
I look at all this that you have
and I think

1095
01:06:59,730 --> 01:07:02,770
"This isn't bad.
This is good."

1096
01:07:02,810 --> 01:07:06,050
And I think maybe
I could be a part of it,

1097
01:07:06,090 --> 01:07:08,770
maybe I could do this.

1098
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:12,730
What, you mean, like go here,

1099
01:07:12,770 --> 01:07:14,730
like matriculate?

1100
01:07:14,770 --> 01:07:17,450
Yeah. Yeah, matriculate.

1101
01:07:17,490 --> 01:07:21,290
Mick, there's things
you have to do.

1102
01:07:21,330 --> 01:07:23,090
There's tests you have to take.

1103
01:07:23,130 --> 01:07:25,850
No, I know, I know,
but maybe I could do them,

1104
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:27,810
whatever they are.

1105
01:07:27,850 --> 01:07:31,250
I've been...

1106
01:07:31,290 --> 01:07:33,210
"auditing," right?

1107
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:34,410
Yeah.

1108
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:36,730
Mary's classes.

1109
01:07:36,770 --> 01:07:39,570
And it's not like every room
is full of geniuses.

1110
01:07:41,810 --> 01:07:43,650
Is this about Mary?

1111
01:07:43,690 --> 01:07:46,490
Because, Mick, there's gonna
be Marys wherever you go.

1112
01:07:46,530 --> 01:07:48,650
It's the whole
goddamn thing, Charlie,

1113
01:07:48,690 --> 01:07:51,170
just all of it.

1114
01:07:52,650 --> 01:07:54,850
Mick, I gotta tell you something.

1115
01:07:54,890 --> 01:07:57,450
I'm the one that called the cops
after you beat those guys

1116
01:07:57,450 --> 01:07:59,650
on the roof after the party.

1117
01:07:59,690 --> 01:08:02,530
I don't want that to be
a secret anymore, all right?

1118
01:08:05,410 --> 01:08:08,490
Watch out.
Buzzy Tim's up on the roof, man.

1119
01:08:08,530 --> 01:08:10,170
I think he's gonna
fucking jump.

1120
01:08:13,890 --> 01:08:15,410
Okay.

1121
01:08:15,450 --> 01:08:18,210
- Man: He's up here, man.
- Woman: Oh my God.

1122
01:08:18,250 --> 01:08:21,090
Hey, yo BT, what are you doing?

1123
01:08:21,130 --> 01:08:24,170
Charlie: Tim, hey, can we come up?

1124
01:08:24,210 --> 01:08:27,650
Hey, you want to smoke
a doobie, Tim?

1125
01:08:27,690 --> 01:08:30,010
Tim: Don't. Derrida. Derrida.

1126
01:08:30,050 --> 01:08:31,490
Derrida.

1127
01:08:31,530 --> 01:08:35,490
- What's Derrida?
- He's a French deconstructionist.

1128
01:08:35,530 --> 01:08:38,290
Hey, Tim, am I gonna come up there
and smoke this doob or what?

1129
01:08:38,330 --> 01:08:40,690
Derrida. Derrida.

1130
01:08:40,730 --> 01:08:43,010
Derrida. Truth.

1131
01:08:43,050 --> 01:08:45,130
Tim, hey hey, it's Charlie Banks.

1132
01:08:45,170 --> 01:08:46,770
What's the truth?

1133
01:08:46,810 --> 01:08:50,130
Come up here. Come up here,
brother man with the doobie,

1134
01:08:50,170 --> 01:08:52,810
and yeah, let's clear a path
to the truth.

1135
01:08:52,850 --> 01:08:54,730
Derrida Derrida Derrida.

1136
01:08:54,770 --> 01:08:56,410
Mick: How do l--? Hang on.

1137
01:08:56,450 --> 01:08:58,170
Tim: Gravity.

1138
01:08:58,210 --> 01:09:00,650
- Gravity. Gravitas.
- Charlie: There you go.

1139
01:09:00,690 --> 01:09:03,170
Mick: Mm-hmm. Tim.

1140
01:09:03,210 --> 01:09:04,570
Tim: Gravy.

1141
01:09:04,610 --> 01:09:07,250
- (people scream)
- Mick: Oh shit!

1142
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:12,490
- Charlie.
- I got you.

1143
01:09:12,490 --> 01:09:15,570
- Are we okay up here, Charlie?
- We're okay.

1144
01:09:15,610 --> 01:09:17,530
- Pull me up.
- I'm trying.

1145
01:09:19,530 --> 01:09:21,130
Is he dead?

1146
01:09:21,170 --> 01:09:23,370
Woman: You got him.

1147
01:09:23,410 --> 01:09:25,610
Mick: Just be cool.

1148
01:09:25,650 --> 01:09:27,850
- Woman: Hang on.
- Charlie: Come on.

1149
01:09:27,850 --> 01:09:30,250
Woman #2: Come on, Mick.
You're gonna be okay.

1150
01:09:30,250 --> 01:09:32,170
- Man: You got him.
- Man #2: Don't move him.

1151
01:09:32,210 --> 01:09:34,090
Woman: Come on,
pull him hard.

1152
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:37,090
- (both panting)
- Charlie: Okay.

1153
01:09:37,130 --> 01:09:39,490
All right.

1154
01:09:41,450 --> 01:09:43,410
Oh shit.

1155
01:09:47,210 --> 01:09:48,650
Okay.

1156
01:09:51,850 --> 01:09:55,010
You know how they say

1157
01:09:55,050 --> 01:09:57,890
your life flashes before your eyes
when you think you're gonna die?

1158
01:09:57,930 --> 01:09:59,170
Yeah.

1159
01:09:59,210 --> 01:10:01,090
That's true.

1160
01:10:01,130 --> 01:10:02,930
Mine did.

1161
01:10:02,970 --> 01:10:04,690
How did it look?

1162
01:10:04,730 --> 01:10:07,050
Eh-- the jury ain't in yet.

1163
01:10:13,970 --> 01:10:17,850
Hey, what's--

1164
01:10:17,890 --> 01:10:20,370
what's a deconstructionist do?

1165
01:10:20,410 --> 01:10:23,570
(chuckles)
I don't know,

1166
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:26,170
it's like--

1167
01:10:26,210 --> 01:10:28,490
it's like you take something
apart, right?

1168
01:10:28,490 --> 01:10:31,410
And you see all of its threads,
you know,

1169
01:10:31,450 --> 01:10:34,210
and you see that all these threads
have different meaning.

1170
01:10:34,250 --> 01:10:36,770
And you kind of examine
how these meanings

1171
01:10:36,810 --> 01:10:39,410
were, like, imposed
upon these threads.

1172
01:10:42,330 --> 01:10:44,170
That's it?

1173
01:10:44,170 --> 01:10:45,770
Come on, then what happens?

1174
01:10:45,810 --> 01:10:48,210
(chuckles)

1175
01:10:48,250 --> 01:10:51,530
I guess you kind of reveal
all the contradictions

1176
01:10:51,530 --> 01:10:54,170
and inconsistencies
and you see

1177
01:10:54,210 --> 01:10:56,730
that there's no one truth
expressed by that thing.

1178
01:10:56,770 --> 01:11:00,130
You know, you see that
there's no absolute truth.

1179
01:11:02,010 --> 01:11:03,930
(Mick exhales)

1180
01:11:03,970 --> 01:11:06,130
No wonder he jumped.

1181
01:11:17,930 --> 01:11:20,770
Hey. Hey, Mick...

1182
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:36,730
You really do slay me, Charlie.

1183
01:11:40,610 --> 01:11:42,410
To all a good night.

1184
01:11:42,410 --> 01:11:44,330
Nia and Danny: Good night.

1185
01:11:53,370 --> 01:11:55,570
Good night...

1186
01:11:55,610 --> 01:11:57,370
I hope.

1187
01:11:57,410 --> 01:11:59,290
It's just kind of over.

1188
01:11:59,330 --> 01:12:02,050
Hey, you know,
I hate when it's over.

1189
01:12:02,090 --> 01:12:03,250
I know you do.

1190
01:12:06,570 --> 01:12:08,530
Mick: Fucking Buzzy Tim.

1191
01:12:08,570 --> 01:12:10,810
Leo: A little R&R in the Poughkeepsie
General Flight Deck

1192
01:12:10,850 --> 01:12:12,810
and old Buzzy will be
good as new.

1193
01:12:12,850 --> 01:12:15,530
Oh, hey, I want to christen
the boat tonight.

1194
01:12:15,570 --> 01:12:19,010
So everybody bring a bottle
and a name.

1195
01:12:19,050 --> 01:12:21,570
I'm looking for something tragic,
mythological,

1196
01:12:21,610 --> 01:12:23,210
yet perhaps with a touch
of humor.

1197
01:12:23,210 --> 01:12:24,930
Mary: How about Humpty Dumpty?

1198
01:12:24,970 --> 01:12:28,010
Mick: That poor little egg breaks
my heart every time I think about him.

1199
01:12:28,050 --> 01:12:30,250
Leo: I won't be mocked,
seriously.

1200
01:12:30,290 --> 01:12:32,570
Mary: No, actually I think
you will be.

1201
01:12:32,610 --> 01:12:35,930
Shit. Give me the paper.
We should probably actually head--

1202
01:12:35,970 --> 01:12:38,490
- Leo.
- Hi.

1203
01:12:38,530 --> 01:12:40,970
Look, if I don't get that key back
and I get fired,

1204
01:12:41,010 --> 01:12:43,410
my financial aid
could be affected.

1205
01:12:43,450 --> 01:12:45,250
- You understand?
- Right.

1206
01:12:45,290 --> 01:12:46,690
I need that key back.

1207
01:12:46,730 --> 01:12:49,650
Oh my God,

1208
01:12:49,690 --> 01:12:52,970
I just remembered
I gave it to Buzzy Tim.

1209
01:12:53,010 --> 01:12:55,690
Wha--?

1210
01:12:55,690 --> 01:12:58,450
Buzzy Tim's got the keys.

1211
01:12:58,490 --> 01:12:59,970
All right?

1212
01:13:06,210 --> 01:13:08,130
- What?
- That was horrible.

1213
01:13:08,170 --> 01:13:09,930
That was lame, Leo.

1214
01:13:09,930 --> 01:13:12,570
Leo, they're right.
That was really awful.

1215
01:13:12,610 --> 01:13:14,930
Hey hey, I was just scatting, man.

1216
01:13:14,970 --> 01:13:16,850
The words came out
before I could sensor them.

1217
01:13:16,890 --> 01:13:18,810
Why don't you just go
tell her the truth?

1218
01:13:18,850 --> 01:13:20,650
The girl did you a solid.

1219
01:13:20,690 --> 01:13:24,530
I'm way too hung-over
for a lecture, all right? So fuck off.

1220
01:13:24,570 --> 01:13:27,490
Hey hey, Leo, while you're at it,

1221
01:13:27,530 --> 01:13:29,970
why don't you tell her boss
that you stole the key from her

1222
01:13:30,010 --> 01:13:32,010
so she doesn't lose
her job.

1223
01:13:32,050 --> 01:13:35,410
That would be a lie worth telling.

1224
01:13:35,450 --> 01:13:37,370
Are you fucking kidding me?

1225
01:13:37,410 --> 01:13:39,210
Do I look like I'm fucking
kidding you?

1226
01:13:39,250 --> 01:13:42,370
Mick, why don't you
take it easy, okay?

1227
01:13:42,410 --> 01:13:46,090
Seriously, Mick,
the noble savage routine

1228
01:13:46,090 --> 01:13:48,330
is losing its charm.

1229
01:13:48,330 --> 01:13:50,290
Hey, Leo.

1230
01:13:51,530 --> 01:13:54,250
- Mick, what are you doing? Jesus.
- Oh my God.

1231
01:13:55,530 --> 01:13:57,610
- Oh my God.
- Are you out of your mind?

1232
01:13:57,650 --> 01:13:59,370
- What?
- What are you doing?

1233
01:13:59,370 --> 01:14:01,610
He's being an asshole.

1234
01:14:01,610 --> 01:14:03,650
And he swung at me first.

1235
01:14:03,690 --> 01:14:05,610
- Oh, he swung at you?
- Jesus, Mary.

1236
01:14:05,650 --> 01:14:08,570
It's Leo, for chrissakes.
What the fuck is your problem?

1237
01:14:08,610 --> 01:14:10,330
Nobody got hurt.
It's just a thing.

1238
01:14:10,370 --> 01:14:11,970
- Nia: Are you okay?
- Mary: Let's just go.

1239
01:14:12,010 --> 01:14:14,570
Leo, I'm sorry
I smacked you, okay?

1240
01:14:16,370 --> 01:14:18,210
Come on.

1241
01:14:18,250 --> 01:14:19,610
Come on, he's fine.

1242
01:14:58,250 --> 01:14:59,810
Hey, where's Mick?

1243
01:14:59,850 --> 01:15:01,730
Jesus. I don't know. With Mary.

1244
01:15:01,770 --> 01:15:04,850
With Mary? Listen. "Louis Kennet,
28, was beaten to death

1245
01:15:04,890 --> 01:15:07,210
April 25th--" That's the day
before Mick showed up here.

1246
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:09,730
"--in Tommy's Trickle Down bar
on 6th Avenue in Manhattan.

1247
01:15:09,770 --> 01:15:11,930
Judy Nicodet, 24, Kennet's
companion that evening,

1248
01:15:11,970 --> 01:15:14,770
detailed the attack to detectives.
According to Miss Nicodet,

1249
01:15:14,810 --> 01:15:17,530
the assailant drove Mr. Kennet
to the floor with a barstool

1250
01:15:17,570 --> 01:15:20,570
and then jumped up
and stomped on his head."

1251
01:15:20,610 --> 01:15:22,970
Does that sound familiar, Danny?

1252
01:15:25,410 --> 01:15:27,850
Does that sound familiar?

1253
01:15:29,690 --> 01:15:32,730
You fucking knew
about this, didn't you?

1254
01:15:32,770 --> 01:15:34,810
You lied to me.

1255
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:38,090
It was self-defense.

1256
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:43,530
Charlie, look, he figured

1257
01:15:43,530 --> 01:15:46,170
with his past, he'd probably better
disappear, right?

1258
01:15:46,210 --> 01:15:48,610
- I mean, that makes sense, okay?
- Yeah, that makes a lot of sense.

1259
01:15:48,650 --> 01:15:50,650
He just wanted to come up
and say goodbye and that's it.

1260
01:15:50,690 --> 01:15:54,010
- He's my friend, Charlie.
- He's your friend? He's your friend?

1261
01:15:54,050 --> 01:15:55,850
We've been friends
since we were little kids.

1262
01:15:55,850 --> 01:15:58,730
He's your friend? Then I guess
you haven't lied to his face

1263
01:15:58,770 --> 01:16:00,930
for a fucking month, Danny.

1264
01:16:00,970 --> 01:16:02,730
I didn't know he was gonna
be here this long.

1265
01:16:02,730 --> 01:16:04,490
- I'm sorry.
- I can't believe it.

1266
01:16:04,530 --> 01:16:07,090
You can't believe it?
The guy jumped him, all right?

1267
01:16:07,130 --> 01:16:09,490
The guy jumped him.
And Mick felt fucking terrible about it.

1268
01:16:09,530 --> 01:16:12,170
- Do you think he's happy?
- Yeah, I'm sure he's weeping, Danny.

1269
01:16:12,170 --> 01:16:13,890
I'm sure he's fucking weeping.

1270
01:16:13,930 --> 01:16:16,290
You didn't even kill this guy.
You got nothing to do with this.

1271
01:16:16,330 --> 01:16:19,410
- Not with my own hands, okay?
- What the hell are you talking about?

1272
01:16:19,450 --> 01:16:22,770
Mick swears up and down
that he had no other fucking choice.

1273
01:16:22,810 --> 01:16:24,650
- That's all he could do.
- He had no choice?

1274
01:16:24,690 --> 01:16:27,490
Fuck that. He had a choice to not
stomp on the guy if he was out cold.

1275
01:16:27,530 --> 01:16:29,810
How do you know?

1276
01:16:29,850 --> 01:16:32,650
I'm surprised at you, Charlie.

1277
01:16:32,650 --> 01:16:34,570
You believe
everything you read?

1278
01:16:49,450 --> 01:16:51,690
Okay. All right.

1279
01:16:51,690 --> 01:16:54,890
I walk in for a beer, right?

1280
01:16:54,890 --> 01:16:57,290
I see this fine girl at the bar.
I give her a look.

1281
01:16:57,290 --> 01:16:59,130
This guys she's with
jumps down my throat.

1282
01:16:59,170 --> 01:17:01,330
I walk away
because I just want a beer.

1283
01:17:01,370 --> 01:17:03,890
He gets back in my face,
all right?

1284
01:17:03,930 --> 01:17:06,850
He swung. I swung, right?

1285
01:17:06,890 --> 01:17:09,770
But then that wasted chick
starts yelling,

1286
01:17:09,810 --> 01:17:12,010
"Shoot him, Louie."

1287
01:17:14,370 --> 01:17:16,730
The last thing on my mind
when I walked into that bar

1288
01:17:16,770 --> 01:17:18,530
was killing anybody.
I swear to God.

1289
01:17:18,570 --> 01:17:20,130
You could have still talked
to the cops.

1290
01:17:20,170 --> 01:17:21,930
You could have told them
your side of the story.

1291
01:17:21,930 --> 01:17:25,370
Look, Mick, Charlie's got a point.
Mick, fuck, man, it's in the papers.

1292
01:17:25,410 --> 01:17:27,370
Mick, maybe you should
get a lawyer now.

1293
01:17:27,410 --> 01:17:29,650
- Exactly.
- The guy at the bar who saw--

1294
01:17:29,690 --> 01:17:32,010
You guys can talk to the cops,
not me.

1295
01:17:35,370 --> 01:17:37,690
I was gonna take a train
down to Florida

1296
01:17:37,730 --> 01:17:40,010
'cause I know a couple
of hard guys down there

1297
01:17:40,050 --> 01:17:41,970
who could help me
go away for good.

1298
01:17:42,010 --> 01:17:44,810
But cruising through Penn Station,
I see that there's a train

1299
01:17:44,850 --> 01:17:47,730
heading up north in five minutes.
I think, "Danny boy's up there

1300
01:17:47,770 --> 01:17:49,690
getting over."

1301
01:17:49,730 --> 01:17:52,170
And I remember
when I was a kid

1302
01:17:52,210 --> 01:17:54,890
the Fresh Air Fund
sent me

1303
01:17:54,890 --> 01:17:57,850
to a summer camp up here

1304
01:17:57,890 --> 01:17:59,930
with goats and cows and shit.

1305
01:17:59,970 --> 01:18:02,050
So I just flipped a coin.

1306
01:18:06,370 --> 01:18:09,130
You know, this place--

1307
01:18:09,170 --> 01:18:11,610
I listen to what I'm thinking

1308
01:18:11,650 --> 01:18:15,490
and I'm sitting in some class

1309
01:18:15,530 --> 01:18:18,490
or laying around with Mary,

1310
01:18:18,530 --> 01:18:22,570
and I wonder

1311
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:25,570
if it's me.

1312
01:18:27,610 --> 01:18:29,930
And then I think,
"Well, maybe it is."

1313
01:18:31,850 --> 01:18:34,010
You know?
And I just--

1314
01:18:35,570 --> 01:18:38,010
I never would have known if l--

1315
01:18:39,730 --> 01:18:42,330
if I never came up here.

1316
01:18:44,690 --> 01:18:46,810
Do you know that this is
the first book

1317
01:18:46,850 --> 01:18:49,010
I ever read cover to cover?

1318
01:18:56,290 --> 01:19:00,010
"So we beat on,

1319
01:19:00,050 --> 01:19:01,970
boats against the current,

1320
01:19:02,010 --> 01:19:04,890
borne back ceaselessly
into the past."

1321
01:19:06,730 --> 01:19:08,930
(exhales)

1322
01:19:12,850 --> 01:19:14,970
So what am I supposed
to do, Charlie?

1323
01:19:19,530 --> 01:19:22,970
Just let my ass
get dragged back?

1324
01:19:24,450 --> 01:19:27,450
I mean, what would you do?

1325
01:19:58,090 --> 01:19:59,890
Hey.

1326
01:19:59,930 --> 01:20:01,570
What's going on?

1327
01:20:01,610 --> 01:20:03,370
Hey, can I borrow a cigarette?

1328
01:20:03,410 --> 01:20:04,970
Yeah.

1329
01:20:05,010 --> 01:20:06,610
Thanks, man.

1330
01:20:35,010 --> 01:20:37,050
Woman: Hey, Mick.

1331
01:20:54,330 --> 01:20:56,650
- Hey.
- I'm really slammed.

1332
01:20:58,450 --> 01:21:01,770
- Okay, Mary, let me explain.
- That was unforgiveable.

1333
01:21:05,930 --> 01:21:08,850
It was fucked up,
me hitting Leo,

1334
01:21:08,890 --> 01:21:11,130
if you take it cold.

1335
01:21:11,170 --> 01:21:13,450
But if you think about all of it,
if you think about

1336
01:21:13,450 --> 01:21:15,370
everything that's been
going on here,

1337
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:18,410
and you take apart
all of the threads,

1338
01:21:18,450 --> 01:21:21,370
and you look at each
individual thread--

1339
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:24,290
What the hell are you
talking about?

1340
01:21:24,330 --> 01:21:26,930
Unforgiveable, Mary?

1341
01:21:28,330 --> 01:21:32,090
No, see?
It's not that simple because--

1342
01:21:32,130 --> 01:21:34,050
ask Charlie--
there is no absolute truth.

1343
01:21:34,090 --> 01:21:36,330
I can't do this now.

1344
01:21:36,370 --> 01:21:38,650
I can't.

1345
01:21:40,410 --> 01:21:42,690
I had fun

1346
01:21:42,730 --> 01:21:44,970
at Leo's and at the dance,

1347
01:21:45,010 --> 01:21:47,730
but I have to write
my paper now.

1348
01:21:47,770 --> 01:21:49,730
Okay?

1349
01:21:49,770 --> 01:21:51,690
I'm sorry.

1350
01:22:08,970 --> 01:22:10,930
(bangs)

1351
01:22:19,530 --> 01:22:22,530
Danny: I'm gonna go fucking nuts,
all right? Give me a goddamn minute.

1352
01:22:22,570 --> 01:22:24,970
- Danny, what about the next guy?
- What fucking next guy?

1353
01:22:24,970 --> 01:22:27,410
You're talking like he's some
goddamn serial killer or some shit.

1354
01:22:27,450 --> 01:22:29,730
Don't you think
we have a responsibility?

1355
01:22:29,770 --> 01:22:31,930
This has nothing to do with you.
You understand?

1356
01:22:31,970 --> 01:22:34,850
This has fucking nothing
to do with you, Charlie.

1357
01:22:34,890 --> 01:22:37,330
- Hey, what if he's lying?
- He's not fucking lying.

1358
01:22:37,370 --> 01:22:39,690
- What if he's lying?
- Because whatever Mickey is,

1359
01:22:39,690 --> 01:22:41,930
- he isn't a fucking liar.
- That's it? That's it?

1360
01:22:41,930 --> 01:22:43,930
- Hey, Charlie, fuck off.
- That's not good enough for me.

1361
01:22:43,970 --> 01:22:46,010
Shut up. Shut up.
Fuck off, okay?

1362
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:48,810
Go back to the goddamn dorms
and fuck off, Charlie.

1363
01:22:48,810 --> 01:22:51,170
- Hey, Danny, Danny.
- I'm fucking done, Charlie.

1364
01:22:51,210 --> 01:22:53,530
- Danny, Danny, hold up.
- I'm not listening to you anymore.

1365
01:22:53,570 --> 01:22:56,530
I told Mick I was the one who called
the police on him, all right?

1366
01:22:56,570 --> 01:22:58,890
- You called the fucking cops?
- Three years ago after the fight

1367
01:22:58,890 --> 01:23:00,690
on the roof, I called the police.
I told him last night.

1368
01:23:00,730 --> 01:23:02,170
- Three years ago?
- Yeah.

1369
01:23:02,210 --> 01:23:04,130
- You fucking did that?
- Yeah. Yes.

1370
01:23:04,170 --> 01:23:06,290
You motherfucker,
what's wrong with you?

1371
01:23:06,330 --> 01:23:08,250
You told him?
What did he say?

1372
01:23:08,290 --> 01:23:10,210
I don't know.
No, he didn't say anything.

1373
01:23:10,250 --> 01:23:12,770
- Danny.
- I can't fucking believe you.

1374
01:23:12,810 --> 01:23:14,610
Danny, a guy fucking died, okay?

1375
01:23:14,650 --> 01:23:16,690
A guy fucking died.

1376
01:23:16,730 --> 01:23:18,650
A guy shouldn't have died,
all right?

1377
01:23:21,130 --> 01:23:22,890
What does that have to do
with anything?

1378
01:23:22,890 --> 01:23:25,970
You're holding this in like you've got
some form of responsibility for this?

1379
01:23:26,010 --> 01:23:29,770
Oh, Christ, Charlie, I didn't want this
to have anything to do with you.

1380
01:23:29,810 --> 01:23:31,530
- Do you understand?
- Yeah.

1381
01:23:31,530 --> 01:23:33,930
- Danny, Danny.
- Nia, can I call you in a little while?

1382
01:23:33,970 --> 01:23:35,450
- Have you seen Mick?
- No.

1383
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:37,130
- Do you know what he did?
- What did he do?

1384
01:23:37,170 --> 01:23:39,090
He beat the shit out of Leo.

1385
01:23:39,130 --> 01:23:40,970
What the hell is wrong
with that guy?

1386
01:23:40,970 --> 01:23:43,170
- Where's Leo?
- He's home.

1387
01:23:43,210 --> 01:23:45,770
- Where's Mary? Is she all right?
- I don't know where she is.

1388
01:23:45,810 --> 01:23:47,850
- Excuse me.
- Hey, Charlie, where are you going?

1389
01:24:03,450 --> 01:24:05,370
Mary.

1390
01:24:44,490 --> 01:24:47,010
It's quiet in here during exams.

1391
01:24:47,050 --> 01:24:49,850
I don't make nearly enough money
without the college crowd.

1392
01:24:49,890 --> 01:24:52,650
Still, it is very very nice

1393
01:24:52,690 --> 01:24:55,370
to have the bar just full of
regular working people, huh?

1394
01:24:55,370 --> 01:24:57,290
(country song playing)

1395
01:24:59,530 --> 01:25:01,770
Right? Here's to working people.

1396
01:25:02,890 --> 01:25:04,890
What's the matter with you?
You need more beer?

1397
01:25:04,930 --> 01:25:06,850
You're usually completely
naked by now.

1398
01:25:10,010 --> 01:25:15,210
¶ It won't matter with me ¶

1399
01:25:16,810 --> 01:25:19,570
¶ When she ran away ¶

1400
01:25:19,610 --> 01:25:22,290
¶ My world ended that day ¶

1401
01:25:22,330 --> 01:25:27,050
¶ So I don't care if tomorrow
never comes. ¶

1402
01:25:35,530 --> 01:25:37,650
Hey, Leo.

1403
01:25:37,690 --> 01:25:40,090
Hey. Hey.

1404
01:25:41,930 --> 01:25:44,050
- Hey, what's up?
- Hey, are you all right?

1405
01:25:44,090 --> 01:25:46,170
- Yeah, I'm okay. I'm all right.
- Are you sure?

1406
01:25:46,210 --> 01:25:48,290
I've just, you know, been...

1407
01:25:48,330 --> 01:25:50,770
- I know. I heard about that.
- Nasty.

1408
01:25:50,810 --> 01:25:53,130
I know, I know.
Hey, where is Mary?

1409
01:25:53,130 --> 01:25:55,650
Mary? She went
to the liquor store.

1410
01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:57,650
- She's at the liquor store?
- We're christening the boat tonight.

1411
01:25:57,690 --> 01:25:59,850
- We're gonna be pirates.
- We're gonna be pirates?

1412
01:25:59,850 --> 01:26:02,170
- All right.
- You too, Charlie. I'll see you there.

1413
01:26:02,210 --> 01:26:04,610
We're gonna sail
into the killer fucking night!

1414
01:26:12,530 --> 01:26:14,890
(bell dinging quietly)

1415
01:26:29,210 --> 01:26:32,410
- (thud)
- Jesus, you scared me.

1416
01:26:32,450 --> 01:26:34,370
Are we having a party?

1417
01:26:34,410 --> 01:26:37,970
We're supposed to christen the boat,
but Leo's a little under the weather.

1418
01:26:38,010 --> 01:26:40,170
I know. Look,

1419
01:26:40,210 --> 01:26:42,690
like I was trying to say,
I'm sorry about that.

1420
01:26:43,690 --> 01:26:46,890
Look look, just give me
another chance.

1421
01:26:46,930 --> 01:26:50,090
Mick, it was fun, okay?
We both knew how far it was gonna go.

1422
01:26:50,090 --> 01:26:52,970
I'm sorry I hurt you.
I'm gonna go, okay?

1423
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:57,290
How far it was gonna go?
I knew what this was gonna be like?

1424
01:26:57,290 --> 01:26:59,890
Mary, please please.
Please stop.

1425
01:26:59,930 --> 01:27:02,370
- (Mary crying) No.
- Stop, please.

1426
01:27:04,450 --> 01:27:07,810
Mary: No. No. No.

1427
01:27:09,130 --> 01:27:11,770
(Mary sobbing)

1428
01:27:12,970 --> 01:27:15,370
I'm done with you,
fucking bitch!

1429
01:27:18,250 --> 01:27:20,970
- Mary.
- Charlie: Mick. Mick. Mick.

1430
01:27:21,010 --> 01:27:23,370
Mick, get off her.

1431
01:27:25,050 --> 01:27:28,650
Oh, Charlie boy.

1432
01:27:28,650 --> 01:27:30,690
Mick, what the hell
are you doing?

1433
01:27:30,730 --> 01:27:33,930
- Mary: Charlie. Charlie.
- Shut up!

1434
01:27:33,970 --> 01:27:37,650
Oh, look at you. You man up nice.
That's pretty impressive.

1435
01:27:37,690 --> 01:27:40,010
- Now let us finish our conversation.
- No, she's coming with me.

1436
01:27:40,050 --> 01:27:43,210
- Charlie: Mary. Come on.
- Oh, nice. That's pretty impressive.

1437
01:27:44,530 --> 01:27:47,530
- Mary: Charlie.
- Oh, you're really on a roll, Charlie.

1438
01:27:47,570 --> 01:27:50,930
- Charlie, help. Mick, no!
- Well, let me tell you something.

1439
01:27:50,970 --> 01:27:52,530
- Charlie: What? What?
- Come here. Come here.

1440
01:27:52,570 --> 01:27:55,570
I just want to tell you
one thing-- just one thing.

1441
01:27:55,610 --> 01:27:58,290
I already knew it was you
who went to the cops.

1442
01:27:58,330 --> 01:28:00,730
- Come on, Mick.
- No no, I knew it

1443
01:28:00,770 --> 01:28:03,090
the moment you walked in your room
and saw me there,

1444
01:28:03,130 --> 01:28:06,250
just like a big neon sign saying,
"lt was me, Mick. It was me."

1445
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:10,810
So fuck you
and fuck your big confession.

1446
01:28:10,850 --> 01:28:13,730
But you know what, Charlie?

1447
01:28:13,770 --> 01:28:14,850
What?

1448
01:28:14,890 --> 01:28:18,450
You were the first rat
I was ever willing to forgive,

1449
01:28:18,490 --> 01:28:20,690
the first one.

1450
01:28:20,730 --> 01:28:22,570
You want to know why?

1451
01:28:22,610 --> 01:28:25,090
Yeah, why?

1452
01:28:28,650 --> 01:28:31,970
Because you made me feel hope.

1453
01:28:33,450 --> 01:28:35,690
- I know I did.
- Yeah.

1454
01:28:35,690 --> 01:28:39,250
Because the two of you

1455
01:28:39,290 --> 01:28:41,930
made me believe
that I could be forgiven.

1456
01:28:41,970 --> 01:28:43,930
Yeah, I know.

1457
01:28:43,970 --> 01:28:46,930
(laughs, groans)

1458
01:28:46,970 --> 01:28:50,490
You know,
I believed it too, Mick.

1459
01:28:51,850 --> 01:28:54,490
I did until today.

1460
01:28:58,650 --> 01:29:01,370
(exhales)

1461
01:29:05,170 --> 01:29:07,450
You are a cold little bitch, Charlie.

1462
01:29:07,490 --> 01:29:09,770
- What the fuck are you doing?
- Come on, Charlie.

1463
01:29:09,770 --> 01:29:12,570
- What the fuck are you doing?
- This is it. This is your big moment.

1464
01:29:14,090 --> 01:29:16,170
Mary: Mick, stop!

1465
01:29:17,770 --> 01:29:18,810
Please stop.

1466
01:29:18,850 --> 01:29:20,770
(Mick chuckles)

1467
01:29:20,810 --> 01:29:23,770
Charlie, are you all right?

1468
01:29:32,450 --> 01:29:35,170
Okay. Okay, Charlie.

1469
01:30:06,890 --> 01:30:09,890
Stop it. Charlie. Charlie.

1470
01:30:09,930 --> 01:30:12,930
- Shut the fuck up.
- (screams)

1471
01:30:24,690 --> 01:30:26,850
(bell dinging)

1472
01:30:27,850 --> 01:30:30,090
(Mary sobbing)

1473
01:31:10,530 --> 01:31:12,570
(distant sirens wailing)

1474
01:31:18,770 --> 01:31:20,850
Charlie.

1475
01:31:26,410 --> 01:31:28,610
Charlie's voice:
Danny called the cops.

1476
01:31:28,650 --> 01:31:32,010
We found out Mick was lying.

1477
01:31:32,050 --> 01:31:35,490
Louis Kennet didn't have a gun.

1478
01:31:37,210 --> 01:31:39,410
But Mick got away.

1479
01:31:39,450 --> 01:31:42,970
He jumped in the river, let it
sweep him south back toward the city.

1480
01:31:44,890 --> 01:31:47,410
And he disappeared
into the underworld.

1481
01:31:50,290 --> 01:31:52,290
I've always thought
that night at the marina

1482
01:31:52,330 --> 01:31:55,330
was truly Mick's
graduation ceremony.

1483
01:31:55,370 --> 01:31:57,690
I mean, he showed mercy

1484
01:31:57,730 --> 01:32:00,490
for the first and maybe
the only time in his life.
