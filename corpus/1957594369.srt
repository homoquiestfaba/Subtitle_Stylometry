[energetic heavy metal music]

4
00:03:40,081 --> 00:03:42,083
- Sure I'm runnin' out
 of time here, Ralph,

5
00:03:42,083 --> 00:03:45,294
but I'm not ready to
 sell at that price.

6
00:03:45,294 --> 00:03:49,850
I know, it ain't pretty,
but it's my place.

7
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:53,025
You know, my
 business, my pleasure.

8
00:03:53,025 --> 00:03:56,512
It's my Shangri-La,
 you understand?

9
00:03:56,512 --> 00:03:58,755
Well, hey, Ralph,
could you give me just,

10
00:03:58,755 --> 00:04:02,414
just a couple more
days, to think it over?

11
00:04:02,414 --> 00:04:06,418
Okay, all right,
 yeah, I'll call you.

12
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:08,248
Thanks, buddy.

13
00:04:09,663 --> 00:04:12,907
Cheapskate son of a bitch.

14
00:04:12,907 --> 00:04:15,393
- [Voiceover] KNTZ.

15
00:04:15,393 --> 00:04:17,395
- [Voiceover] Welcome back,
 you're listening to KNTZ,

16
00:04:17,395 --> 00:04:19,120
the nuts network.

17
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:20,536
- [Voiceover] Hallelujah!

18
00:04:20,536 --> 00:04:22,262
- [Voiceover] Whoa, Los
 Angeles, honk those horns,

19
00:04:22,262 --> 00:04:24,091
'cause you're stuck
 in horrendous traffic

20
00:04:24,091 --> 00:04:25,195
this Friday evening.

21
00:04:25,195 --> 00:04:26,335
[fake gun fire and screams]

22
00:04:26,335 --> 00:04:27,543
What's the deal, Rattler?

23
00:04:27,543 --> 00:04:29,096
- [Voiceover] I
 don't know, Ryan.

24
00:04:29,096 --> 00:04:30,856
People are rioting
 in the streets,

25
00:04:30,856 --> 00:04:33,480
going crazy, and the Lakers
 aren't even playing tonight.

26
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:34,929
[rimshot]

27
00:04:34,929 --> 00:04:37,277
You can see it downtown,
 right outside the studio,

28
00:04:37,277 --> 00:04:40,210
there are just a bunch
of loonies on the loose.

29
00:04:40,210 --> 00:04:41,522
- [Voiceover] Well
 lock your doors, LA,

30
00:04:41,522 --> 00:04:42,937
roll up your windows,

31
00:04:42,937 --> 00:04:46,147
and get ready to ride it out
 with Ryan and the Rattler,

32
00:04:46,147 --> 00:04:48,115
here on--

33
00:04:48,115 --> 00:04:51,014
- [Voiceover] KNTZ!
 The nuts network.

34
00:05:04,752 --> 00:05:07,790
- Can't catch a fuckin' break!

35
00:05:07,790 --> 00:05:09,688
- Hey! Spider!

36
00:05:09,688 --> 00:05:14,693
Gimme some change so I can
 come in and have a drink.

37
00:05:14,693 --> 00:05:17,731
It's gonna be a bad
 night out here, man.

38
00:05:17,731 --> 00:05:19,180
- You stink like shit, Pete.

39
00:05:19,180 --> 00:05:21,666
Now here, just take your
 greasy hand off my jacket.

40
00:05:21,666 --> 00:05:23,495
Go drown yourself
 somewhere else.

41
00:05:23,495 --> 00:05:27,396
- Show some love, man!

42
00:05:27,396 --> 00:05:32,159
People so hungry, they
 eatin' each other out here.

43
00:05:32,159 --> 00:05:34,334
- Yeah well, they gotta
eat something, right?

44
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:36,784
- Well fuck you, Spider.

45
00:05:36,784 --> 00:05:38,234
- Fuck you, too, Pete.

46
00:05:38,234 --> 00:05:41,893
- You tell those pretty
little girls of yours,

47
00:05:41,893 --> 00:05:45,172
I'll be out here waitin' for 'em

48
00:05:45,172 --> 00:05:47,519
when you go out of business.

49
00:05:54,802 --> 00:05:56,632
- Hey, how's it goin', boss?

50
00:05:56,632 --> 00:05:58,219
- Keep a close eye on
the door tonight, Marv.

51
00:05:58,219 --> 00:05:59,945
There's a lot of rats
 crawlin' around out there.

52
00:05:59,945 --> 00:06:01,671
I don't want them scaring
 away the customers.

53
00:06:01,671 --> 00:06:02,845
- Oh you got it, boss.

54
00:06:02,845 --> 00:06:04,536
Hey, is it a good
 time to talk about?

55
00:06:04,536 --> 00:06:05,710
Are you busy?

56
00:06:05,710 --> 00:06:07,159
You know, what I
 brought up yesterday?

57
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:08,506
- You haven't seen
 busloads of people

58
00:06:08,506 --> 00:06:10,370
walkin' through that
door, have you, Marvin?

59
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:12,855
No people means no money.

60
00:06:12,855 --> 00:06:16,548
No money means no raise,
so stop beggin' me!

61
00:06:18,205 --> 00:06:20,552
Any lowlife squirm in, you
 just pop 'em in the jaw,

62
00:06:20,552 --> 00:06:22,174
turn 'em around, and
send 'em right back out,

63
00:06:22,174 --> 00:06:24,280
you get a paycheck, huh?

64
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:25,626
You can handle that,
 right, big fella?

65
00:06:25,626 --> 00:06:26,558
- Whatever you say, boss.

66
00:06:26,558 --> 00:06:28,111
- All right.

67
00:06:28,111 --> 00:06:29,906
How'd we do on the early tip?

68
00:06:29,906 --> 00:06:32,219
- Not too good, some
 bum tried to sneak

69
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:33,634
in the back door, I caught him.

70
00:06:33,634 --> 00:06:35,118
You know, he was pissin'
 in the hallway, he's gone.

71
00:06:35,118 --> 00:06:37,051
- Jesus Christ, Marvin, how
 many times I gotta tell you,

72
00:06:37,051 --> 00:06:39,122
that back door stays locked!

73
00:06:39,122 --> 00:06:40,883
You got the balls to
 ask me for a raise?

74
00:06:40,883 --> 00:06:41,884
Jesus Christ.

75
00:06:41,884 --> 00:06:44,093
- Hey, but I got it now, boss.

76
00:06:44,093 --> 00:06:45,543
Weasel dick.

77
00:06:54,379 --> 00:06:56,036
- What ya buildin' there, Bobby?

78
00:06:56,036 --> 00:06:58,072
- My beach house,
 pretty neat, right?

79
00:06:58,072 --> 00:07:00,350
- Speakin' of need,
 Bobby, pour me a whiskey.

80
00:07:00,350 --> 00:07:02,629
Sugar Hills needs her medicine.

81
00:07:02,629 --> 00:07:04,354
Listen, someone better
 call the ambulance

82
00:07:04,354 --> 00:07:07,357
'cause if I can't get a
 rise out of these stiffs,

83
00:07:07,357 --> 00:07:08,635
they ain't got no pulse.

84
00:07:08,635 --> 00:07:11,465
- Put the bottle down, Bobby.

85
00:07:11,465 --> 00:07:13,674
You're out-drinkin'
the customers, sweetie.

86
00:07:13,674 --> 00:07:15,607
- Oh. Really? What customers?

87
00:07:15,607 --> 00:07:17,471
- [laughs sarcastically]
You know the policy.

88
00:07:17,471 --> 00:07:19,404
Sell some drinks,
 get some drinks.

89
00:07:19,404 --> 00:07:21,613
Those cats aren't liquored
 up, they're asleep.

90
00:07:21,613 --> 00:07:23,650
Now I want you to take that
 beautiful ass of yours,

91
00:07:23,650 --> 00:07:25,203
turn it back around,
 march it over there,

92
00:07:25,203 --> 00:07:26,238
and wake 'em up.

93
00:07:26,238 --> 00:07:27,308
Light their jeans on fire.

94
00:07:27,308 --> 00:07:28,793
Hey, tell you what.

95
00:07:28,793 --> 00:07:31,623
You sell a dance, and I'll let
 you put away a whole bottle,

96
00:07:31,623 --> 00:07:32,831
how's that sound?

97
00:07:32,831 --> 00:07:35,627
- Are you havin' a
 rough day, Spider?

98
00:07:35,627 --> 00:07:38,043
Maybe you should
 have that drink, huh?

99
00:07:38,043 --> 00:07:39,389
- I am havin' a rough day.

100
00:07:39,389 --> 00:07:41,771
- Go 'head, pour it.

101
00:07:41,771 --> 00:07:42,979
- Shirley Temple, Bobby!

102
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:45,395
Put the goddamn whiskey down.

103
00:07:45,395 --> 00:07:47,328
I'll tell you what'd
 make it a lot easier,

104
00:07:47,328 --> 00:07:49,572
is if you would just
 do me the simple favor

105
00:07:49,572 --> 00:07:51,712
of not busting my
 balls this evening.

106
00:07:51,712 --> 00:07:53,783
- You know what, Spider?

107
00:07:53,783 --> 00:07:56,648
When I'm feelin' blue and
 nothin's goin' my way,

108
00:07:56,648 --> 00:07:58,754
do you know what I do?

109
00:07:58,754 --> 00:08:03,344
I take a deep breath,
 and I ask myself,

110
00:08:03,344 --> 00:08:08,073
[laughs] what would Hambo
 Ranch Hand do? [laughs]

111
00:08:08,073 --> 00:08:09,972
- You think you're pretty
 damn funny, don't ya?

112
00:08:09,972 --> 00:08:11,214
You think it's just hysterical

113
00:08:11,214 --> 00:08:13,354
that a grown man
 might actually admire

114
00:08:13,354 --> 00:08:15,011
a so-called "children's
entertainer."

115
00:08:15,011 --> 00:08:16,806
Well lemme tell you somethin',

116
00:08:16,806 --> 00:08:19,188
Hambo is an American icon.

117
00:08:19,188 --> 00:08:20,361
30 years on the tube,

118
00:08:20,361 --> 00:08:21,846
and that man is at
 the top of his game!

119
00:08:21,846 --> 00:08:25,194
He's a perfect blend of
morality, pathos, and slapstick.

120
00:08:25,194 --> 00:08:27,852
This man is the Buster
 Keaton of our generation.

121
00:08:27,852 --> 00:08:29,267
He is under-appreciated.

122
00:08:29,267 --> 00:08:30,510
He's always putting his foot
 down for the little guy,

123
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:33,582
but ahhhh.

124
00:08:33,582 --> 00:08:35,791
Can't expect narrow
 minds like you

125
00:08:35,791 --> 00:08:38,000
to appreciate the
 genius that is Hambo.

126
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:39,622
- You're sweet,

127
00:08:39,622 --> 00:08:44,627
but you've got no
 taste. [laughs]

128
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,460
- I hired you, didn't I?

129
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:53,291
[trance electronic music
stuck on same beat]

130
00:08:53,291 --> 00:08:55,017
What the fuck is
 up with this music?

131
00:08:55,017 --> 00:08:57,709
- I don't know,
 but I dig it, man.

132
00:08:57,709 --> 00:08:59,297
Got a nice groove to it.

133
00:08:59,297 --> 00:09:02,196
- I swear, I am gonna
fire that little stoner.

134
00:09:17,867 --> 00:09:18,799
[music screeches off]

135
00:09:18,799 --> 00:09:20,905
- Fuck!

136
00:09:20,905 --> 00:09:24,391
Man, fuck, what the
fuck is with you, dude?

137
00:09:24,391 --> 00:09:25,565
- Told ya before, Berny,

138
00:09:25,565 --> 00:09:27,290
that shit'll lower
 your sperm count.

139
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:30,121
- Man, that is
 pure sativa, dude.

140
00:09:30,121 --> 00:09:33,296
That shit was fuckin'
 expensive, man.

141
00:09:33,296 --> 00:09:34,228
What's the deal, dude?

142
00:09:34,228 --> 00:09:35,644
I was just gonna take my five.

143
00:09:35,644 --> 00:09:37,749
- Well take all the time you
 want, 'cause you're fired.

144
00:09:37,749 --> 00:09:40,096
- Gah, come on, Spider, dude,

145
00:09:40,096 --> 00:09:42,996
I been spinnin' killer
 sets all week, dude.

146
00:09:42,996 --> 00:09:45,412
Tonight, too, man, look,
I brought Dick Dale,

147
00:09:45,412 --> 00:09:49,174
Link Wray, the Atlantics,
 dude, you love this stuff.

148
00:09:49,174 --> 00:09:51,004
- Yeah, but you're
playin' that dirty vinyl

149
00:09:51,004 --> 00:09:52,177
and it keeps skipping.

150
00:09:52,177 --> 00:09:54,110
It positively murders
 the vibe, Bern.

151
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:57,424
Forget it, I'm pluggin'
in the MP3 player.

152
00:09:57,424 --> 00:09:59,978
- Fine, man, go the
 way of the beast.

153
00:09:59,978 --> 00:10:03,085
Hook up that machine that
 pumps out shitty digital jams,

154
00:10:03,085 --> 00:10:04,534
and throw the talent
 out on the street.

155
00:10:04,534 --> 00:10:05,674
That's cool.

156
00:10:05,674 --> 00:10:07,261
- Hey, the talent
 is on the stage.

157
00:10:07,261 --> 00:10:09,367
And every time one of
 those discs wigs out,

158
00:10:09,367 --> 00:10:11,058
we stop making money.

159
00:10:11,058 --> 00:10:14,234
The music never stops,
 never skips, huh?

160
00:10:14,234 --> 00:10:17,064
The tits keep shakin', the
 mopes keep payin', all right?

161
00:10:17,064 --> 00:10:18,825
Take your records and
 clear on outta here.

162
00:10:18,825 --> 00:10:20,171
I'll pay you out for the night.

163
00:10:20,171 --> 00:10:25,141
- Dude, come on, Spider,
man, I love this gig.

164
00:10:25,141 --> 00:10:27,488
Look, gimme another shot,

165
00:10:27,488 --> 00:10:32,079
I'll put on somethin' real
 sick for the next tease.

166
00:10:34,703 --> 00:10:36,497
One more shot, hmm?

167
00:10:36,497 --> 00:10:40,294
- Look, you got one
 last shot, one, one!

168
00:10:40,294 --> 00:10:42,469
And I catch you roastin' a
bone around my equipment again,

169
00:10:42,469 --> 00:10:43,919
you're gone for good.

170
00:10:43,919 --> 00:10:46,197
You're not gonna get me
 in trouble with the cops.

171
00:10:46,197 --> 00:10:48,302
- The cops?

172
00:10:48,302 --> 00:10:53,169
When is the last time you saw
 cops in this neighborhood?

173
00:10:53,169 --> 00:10:54,964
- You're such a smartass.

Check it out.

deep under the spell
 of my surf jam.

196

Look at the bastards!

- It's the music, Bern.

200
00:12:43,832 --> 00:12:45,557
Now I gotta deal

206
00:13:04,749 --> 00:13:06,475
- It's a real bum
 orgy out there, boss.

207
00:13:06,475 --> 00:13:07,959
I haven't ever seen
 so many of 'em.

208
00:13:07,959 --> 00:13:09,547
- Spare me the social
 commentary, big guy.

209
00:13:09,547 --> 00:13:11,894
There's a couple bums in here
 I need you to take a look at.

- They ain't actin' at all,
 the cheap sons of bitches.

212
00:13:23,319 --> 00:13:26,426
- I'm so sorry, Spider, I was
 really using my imagination.

213
00:13:26,426 --> 00:13:29,015
- They aren't interested
in that, sweetie.

214
00:13:29,015 --> 00:13:30,499
What's goin' on?
Is it the music?

215
00:13:30,499 --> 00:13:31,776
It's the music isn't it.

216
00:13:31,776 --> 00:13:32,812
I swear I'm gonna fire that--
 - No, no, no.

 anymore drinks, boss.

Are you nuts?

238
00:14:20,860 --> 00:14:23,207

little scuffed up, but

[Blood spurting]

240
00:14:24,656 --> 00:14:26,796
they were beggin' to come
 in here off the street.

241
00:14:26,796 --> 00:14:28,108
They paid a lot
 of dough up front.

242
00:14:28,108 --> 00:14:29,730
- Get 'em out of here right now!

Move back to the countryside,

253
00:15:26,580 --> 00:15:28,789
because the cities aren't safe.

and they're tellin'
 everyone to stay indoors.

 Spider, they won't leave.

314
00:19:18,398 --> 00:19:20,228
- You must've made quite
an impression, girl.

315
00:19:20,228 --> 00:19:21,643
- Guess I'm gettin'
 the hang of it.

316
00:19:21,643 --> 00:19:23,783

- A little too natural for
 this line of work, come on.

when they were here,
 they'd still be here.

320

Well, I'm glad you're all here.

338
00:20:34,785 --> 00:20:36,407
Got an announcement to make.

339
00:20:36,407 --> 00:20:37,857

 gonna take us all

340
00:20:37,857 --> 00:20:39,686

it up for a second?

343
00:20:44,104 --> 00:20:46,279
This is important.
 - Shut up, Sugar.

344
00:20:46,279 --> 00:20:48,937
It's not orange,
it's terracotta,

345
00:20:48,937 --> 00:20:51,008
and it, like, was
 expensive, okay?

346
00:20:51,008 --> 00:20:52,423
- Lay off her, Sugar.

347
00:20:52,423 --> 00:20:54,391
She hasn't had a
 lifetime of booze

348
00:20:54,391 --> 00:20:57,048
and two dollar tug jobs to
 sour her peach, like you.

349
00:20:57,048 --> 00:20:58,395
- Come on, guys, peace.

350
00:20:58,395 --> 00:21:00,259
- My sour peach is
 bringin' in more money

351
00:21:00,259 --> 00:21:01,812
than your late ass.

352
00:21:01,812 --> 00:21:03,745
Here's a tip, Vanilla, you're
 supposed to get the guys hard,

353
00:21:03,745 --> 00:21:04,849
not beat 'em to a pulp.

354
00:21:04,849 --> 00:21:07,300
[piercing whistle]

355
00:21:07,300 --> 00:21:10,476
- Thank you, Bobby.

356
00:21:10,476 --> 00:21:12,029
Jesus, this isn't gonna be easy.

357
00:21:12,029 --> 00:21:16,136
Look, uh, this affects
 everybody, myself included.

358
00:21:17,345 --> 00:21:18,794
I just got off the
 phone with a guy

359
00:21:18,794 --> 00:21:20,658
who's been breathing down
 my neck for a long time.

360
00:21:20,658 --> 00:21:24,731
Now, you know business has
 been really bad lately.

361
00:21:24,731 --> 00:21:27,113
But it's never been good.

362
00:21:27,113 --> 00:21:30,841
So, uh, I've made
 the tough decision.

363
00:21:30,841 --> 00:21:33,533
I sign the papers tomorrow.

364
00:21:33,533 --> 00:21:37,848
It's over, i sold the Titty.

365
00:21:37,848 --> 00:21:39,643
- I can't believe what
 I'm hearin', Spider.

366
00:21:39,643 --> 00:21:41,817
I mean, what kinda asshole's
 gonna run this place?

367
00:21:41,817 --> 00:21:43,129
- Nobody, this whole place'll be

368
00:21:43,129 --> 00:21:44,889
a parking lot by
 next week, Sugar.

369
00:21:44,889 --> 00:21:46,270
- Guess I won't need
 a fake tan anymore

370
00:21:46,270 --> 00:21:48,307
since we're all gonna
 be dancin' outside.

371
00:21:48,307 --> 00:21:52,034
- Girl, what he means is
you just lost your job.

372
00:21:53,726 --> 00:21:56,004
- Spider, you can't,
 you can't do this.

373
00:21:56,004 --> 00:21:57,833
I mean, I just started,
I need the money

374
00:21:57,833 --> 00:21:59,318
to pay for veterinary school.

375
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:01,078
- Oh cheer up, honey,
 those poor animals

376
00:22:01,078 --> 00:22:02,459
are better off without you.

377
00:22:02,459 --> 00:22:04,253
- Sugar, you are one icy bitch.

378
00:22:04,253 --> 00:22:08,016
- I got every right!
 I'm unemployed.

379
00:22:08,016 --> 00:22:09,949
- Look, Bambi, if
 you need anything,

380
00:22:09,949 --> 00:22:11,640
a place to stay,
 you know, whatever,

381
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:12,814
I got you covered.

382
00:22:12,814 --> 00:22:14,298
- Come to think
 of it, my ex-wife

383
00:22:14,298 --> 00:22:16,887
has an aviary up
 in Topanga Canyon,

384
00:22:16,887 --> 00:22:19,061
might be able to get ya a job.

385
00:22:19,061 --> 00:22:20,373
You like birds?

386
00:22:20,373 --> 00:22:21,616
- This sucks!

387
00:22:21,616 --> 00:22:23,652
- Yeah, I know it sucks.

388
00:22:23,652 --> 00:22:24,895
But look around here, ladies,

389
00:22:24,895 --> 00:22:27,760
no butts in the
 seats means no cash.

390
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:30,590
We could close up tonight
 and no one would even notice.

391
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,833
It's an embarrassment.

392
00:22:31,833 --> 00:22:33,524
- You're givin' this
 a shitty spin, Spider.

393
00:22:33,524 --> 00:22:35,008
Are you sayin' these
 girls are no good?

394
00:22:35,008 --> 00:22:36,734
- No, no, no, no,
 Sugar, no, heck no.

395
00:22:36,734 --> 00:22:39,427
I mean, the Tough Titty has
 the best titties in the city.

396
00:22:39,427 --> 00:22:41,429
- Grade A. A plus.

397
00:22:41,429 --> 00:22:42,878
- I fucked up.

398
00:22:42,878 --> 00:22:44,224
This neighborhood's
 gone to hell.

399
00:22:44,224 --> 00:22:46,468
Nobody comes down here
anymore, they're afraid.

400
00:22:46,468 --> 00:22:47,952
I mean there's rioting
 out in the streets.

401
00:22:47,952 --> 00:22:49,298
Have you turned on the news?

402
00:22:49,298 --> 00:22:50,748
They're telling everybody
 to stay indoors.

403
00:22:50,748 --> 00:22:52,232
- Well it's chaos out there.

404
00:22:52,232 --> 00:22:53,475
- The streets aren't safe,

405
00:22:53,475 --> 00:22:55,650
but I figured we could
 make the best of it.

406
00:22:55,650 --> 00:22:56,961
You know?

407
00:22:56,961 --> 00:23:01,863
So for old time's sake,
and if you wanna leave,

408
00:23:01,863 --> 00:23:04,072
and you're pissed, I understand,
I won't try to stop you,

409
00:23:04,072 --> 00:23:06,557
but I was just hopin'
 that we could all

410
00:23:06,557 --> 00:23:10,009
settle in, kiss
 this place good bye.

411
00:23:10,009 --> 00:23:13,530
No expense, let's
 just fuckin' party!

412
00:23:13,530 --> 00:23:15,394
- You asked for it, Spider.

413
00:23:15,394 --> 00:23:17,844
I'm gonna drink this Titty dry.

414
00:23:17,844 --> 00:23:18,949
- How the hell am I supposed

415
00:23:18,949 --> 00:23:20,709
to meet girls
 without a paycheck?

416
00:23:20,709 --> 00:23:22,780
- Aw, bro, man, you aren't
 gonna land any chicks now,

417
00:23:22,780 --> 00:23:24,161
and you work in a strip club.

418
00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:26,232
- That'd be against policy!

419
00:23:26,232 --> 00:23:28,234
I'm a professional, Bern.

420
00:23:28,234 --> 00:23:31,306
That used to mean somethin'.

421
00:23:31,306 --> 00:23:34,930
- Well there's no
 policy anymore, right?

422
00:23:34,930 --> 00:23:36,829
- Jasmine!

423
00:23:36,829 --> 00:23:39,452
That's the smartest thing
 you've ever said to me.

424
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:42,386
Ah, you're so right,
 and I'm still young.

425
00:23:42,386 --> 00:23:44,664
I don't need 22
 inch rims, I'm good.

426
00:23:44,664 --> 00:23:47,322
I got some dough saved up.

427
00:23:47,322 --> 00:23:49,289
I might be short a
 job, but tonight,

428
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:50,843
I'm gonna be the
 best damn customer

429
00:23:50,843 --> 00:23:52,534
this place has ever seen.

430
00:23:52,534 --> 00:23:55,641
How far will a
 thousand bucks get me?

431
00:23:55,641 --> 00:23:59,403
- Like, to the dry cleaners.

432
00:23:59,403 --> 00:24:03,165
- I think you deserve a little
 better than that, Marvin.

433
00:24:06,341 --> 00:24:09,517
- Hey hey, I got a five spot.

434
00:24:09,517 --> 00:24:11,726
- House wants some music.

435
00:24:11,726 --> 00:24:16,109
Come on, Sugar, will
 you dance with me?

436
00:24:17,490 --> 00:24:21,563
- Not on your life, baby.

437
00:24:21,563 --> 00:24:23,151
- To the eruption room, ladies,

438
00:24:23,151 --> 00:24:24,980
we have all the
 time in the world.

439
00:24:24,980 --> 00:24:27,776
[rock music]

440
00:24:35,266 --> 00:24:38,407
- It's fuckin'
 anarchy out there!

441
00:24:38,407 --> 00:24:41,894
- Whoa whoa whoa, we're closed
 for the evening, sorry, guy.

442
00:24:41,894 --> 00:24:44,793
- Private party, punk, you
 couldn't afford the company.

443
00:24:44,793 --> 00:24:47,347
- Is that right?

444
00:24:52,974 --> 00:24:54,182
- Consider it a down payment

445
00:24:54,182 --> 00:24:56,771
on a new pair of
crutches, street slime.

446
00:24:56,771 --> 00:24:59,636
- Don't touch me, meat spit.

447
00:24:59,636 --> 00:25:02,224
- Son of a.

448
00:25:02,224 --> 00:25:04,882
- Whoa ho ho. Hold it!

449
00:25:04,882 --> 00:25:06,643
This place has plenty of tits,

450
00:25:06,643 --> 00:25:08,437
but where's the hospitality?

451
00:25:08,437 --> 00:25:10,612
A bona fide paying
 customer strolls

452
00:25:10,612 --> 00:25:13,304
into the midst of this
 tropical shithole,

453
00:25:13,304 --> 00:25:15,997
and you try to turn
 him right around?

454
00:25:15,997 --> 00:25:17,964
Folks are nuttier than
 the fucks outside.

455
00:25:17,964 --> 00:25:19,794
- We got a dress code, buddy.

456
00:25:19,794 --> 00:25:22,244
- Yeah, well I left
 my pasties at home.

457
00:25:22,244 --> 00:25:27,111
But I got 16 large burnin' a
 hole in my pocket right now.

458
00:25:27,111 --> 00:25:28,181
- Bullshit.

459
00:25:28,181 --> 00:25:29,562
- True story!

460
00:25:29,562 --> 00:25:32,116
So my band, Nancy
 Reagan's Vagina,

461
00:25:32,116 --> 00:25:33,532
just played down the street,

462
00:25:33,532 --> 00:25:35,050
and we're tearin'
 this place apart,

463
00:25:35,050 --> 00:25:37,915
people start moshin',
 shit got crazy,

464
00:25:37,915 --> 00:25:40,435
dudes started biting
 each other, oh man,

465
00:25:40,435 --> 00:25:42,886
there was blood everywhere.

466
00:25:42,886 --> 00:25:44,888
Total fuckin' chaos.

467
00:25:44,888 --> 00:25:46,890
Security just beat
 it on outta there.

468
00:25:46,890 --> 00:25:51,515
So I dropped my guitar and
 I made for the register.

469
00:25:51,515 --> 00:25:55,484
Boozy motherfuckers
 spent a fortune in there.

470
00:25:55,484 --> 00:25:57,176
- Uh, we don't
 accept dirty money.

471
00:25:57,176 --> 00:25:59,972
- Shut the hell up, Marvin.

472
00:25:59,972 --> 00:26:02,181
What can I do for you, kid?

473
00:26:02,181 --> 00:26:04,079
- Look, I just need
 a place to lay low,

474
00:26:04,079 --> 00:26:05,184
and a phone to call my friends,

475
00:26:05,184 --> 00:26:07,358
let 'em know I'm here.

476
00:26:07,358 --> 00:26:09,429
I'll make it worth your
while, just trust me.

477
00:26:09,429 --> 00:26:10,776
- Yeah, and why're
 you bringin' this shit

478
00:26:10,776 --> 00:26:12,536
to our doorstep, junior?

479
00:26:12,536 --> 00:26:14,952
- I don't know, I saw
 some foxy black chick

480
00:26:14,952 --> 00:26:16,782
kickin' the shit outta
 two dudes out front.

481
00:26:16,782 --> 00:26:19,094
Made my dick hard. [laughs]

482
00:26:19,094 --> 00:26:20,579
- Gimme some of that money,

483
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:23,512
and I'll show you what
 hard really means.

484
00:26:23,512 --> 00:26:26,446
- This night was supposed
 to be about us, Spider.

485
00:26:26,446 --> 00:26:28,656
This punk's gonna
 puke on our party.

486
00:26:28,656 --> 00:26:29,933
- Well, you know,
 I could just take

487
00:26:29,933 --> 00:26:32,314
my investments elsewhere.

488
00:26:32,314 --> 00:26:35,732
- Nope, that won't be necessary.

489
00:26:35,732 --> 00:26:37,526
You just, uh, you cool your jets

490
00:26:37,526 --> 00:26:39,459
and, uh, feel free
 to take advantage

491
00:26:39,459 --> 00:26:41,634
of all of our
 facilities, all right?

492
00:26:41,634 --> 00:26:42,773
- Sugar'll show you to a phone

493
00:26:42,773 --> 00:26:44,257
and get you settled in.

494
00:26:44,257 --> 00:26:47,398
- I'll do a lot more than
 that, Billy Idol. [laughs]

495
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:48,814
- All right, we're cookin.

496
00:26:48,814 --> 00:26:50,678
Ladies, get ready to put
 on the show of the century

497
00:26:50,678 --> 00:26:53,473
for Mister, uh.

498
00:26:53,473 --> 00:26:55,890
- Spike.

499
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,512
- Spike.

500
00:27:00,101 --> 00:27:02,724
- First you fire us, then
 you let that little poser

501
00:27:02,724 --> 00:27:04,312
prance around here
like he owns the place.

502
00:27:04,312 --> 00:27:07,384
Spider, this is supposed
to be my, our, night.

503
00:27:07,384 --> 00:27:10,318
- Don't tell me how to run my
 titty bar, shit for brains.

504
00:27:10,318 --> 00:27:12,251
You wanna save your jobs, right?

505
00:27:12,251 --> 00:27:14,909
Well let's take this little
 chump for everything he's got.

506
00:27:14,909 --> 00:27:16,635
Every buck, every cent.

507
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,050
16 grand!

508
00:27:18,050 --> 00:27:20,362
I mean, half of that will
 put us back in business!

509
00:27:20,362 --> 00:27:22,502
- But that money's stolen, man.

510
00:27:22,502 --> 00:27:23,814
- You said it before yourself,

511
00:27:23,814 --> 00:27:25,505
the cops don't come
down here, we're golden.

512
00:27:25,505 --> 00:27:26,990
- He's so dreamy.

513
00:27:26,990 --> 00:27:27,749
- He's loaded.

514
00:27:27,749 --> 00:27:29,337
- He's an asshole!

515
00:27:29,337 --> 00:27:31,235
- Don't worry, Marvin,
 we can still party.

516
00:27:31,235 --> 00:27:32,685
- I got a grand
 just for you, baby.

517
00:27:32,685 --> 00:27:35,930
- Aww, you say, like,
 the sweetest things.

518
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:39,105
- Look, we get this guy
 loaded, show him a good time,

519
00:27:39,105 --> 00:27:41,176
who knows how much
 cash he'll toss us.

520
00:27:41,176 --> 00:27:43,696
- Come on, Spider, man,
 what are you smokin', dude?

521
00:27:43,696 --> 00:27:45,767
He just said he robbed
 the other place.

522
00:27:45,767 --> 00:27:47,804
- Right, he tries
 to pull any shit,

523
00:27:47,804 --> 00:27:50,772
we'll rob him and toss his
 ass out on the sidewalk.

524
00:27:50,772 --> 00:27:52,912
- This is gettin'
 real interesting.

525
00:27:52,912 --> 00:27:55,604
- And what if he gets junk sick
and tries bitin' all of us?

526
00:27:55,604 --> 00:27:59,263
- I know I'm taking a
 chance, it's for your sake.

527
00:27:59,263 --> 00:28:01,162
So, come on, you
 know, crank the music.

528
00:28:01,162 --> 00:28:02,922
Ladies, get ready to shake it.

529
00:28:02,922 --> 00:28:04,579
We're back in business.

530
00:28:04,579 --> 00:28:05,994
- All right, man.

531
00:28:05,994 --> 00:28:08,756
But I'm gonna need some
 chemical assistance, dude.

532
00:28:08,756 --> 00:28:10,689
- Whatever it takes.

533
00:28:14,554 --> 00:28:18,144
- Oh la la, you're
 in for a real treat.

534
00:28:18,144 --> 00:28:19,870
I hope you saved
 room for dessert,

535
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:22,114
'cause here comes two scoops
 of chocolate ice cream

536
00:28:22,114 --> 00:28:24,530
that'll make your banana split.

537
00:28:24,530 --> 00:28:27,982
Trust me, buddy, you'll wanna
 put cream into this coffee.

538
00:28:27,982 --> 00:28:30,467
Here she comes, Vanilla.

539
00:28:31,779 --> 00:28:34,367
[surf music]

540
00:28:40,615 --> 00:28:41,789
- Woo!

541
00:28:52,109 --> 00:28:55,872
- Damn, boy, you pretty cocky.

542
00:28:55,872 --> 00:28:57,045
You keep feedin' me that bread,

543
00:28:57,045 --> 00:29:00,152
you might just get
 your rocks off.

544
00:29:01,774 --> 00:29:03,983
- I always do. [laughs]

545
00:29:30,596 --> 00:29:32,978
[police sirens wail]

546
00:29:38,259 --> 00:29:40,433
- Maaaaahhh.

547
00:29:40,433 --> 00:29:42,401
[blood spatters]

548
00:29:49,615 --> 00:29:51,928
[sloshing footsteps]

549
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,904
- Make it two, Bobby.

550
00:30:02,904 --> 00:30:04,630
- Two Dark 'N' Stormys.

551
00:30:04,630 --> 00:30:07,736
- Back off the wagon
 again, eh, Spider?

552
00:30:07,736 --> 00:30:09,808
Little stressed out?

553
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,431
- Am I crazy, Sugar?
 Is this crazy?

554
00:30:12,431 --> 00:30:16,504
- Mmmm, the whole
 world's crazy, Spider.

555
00:30:16,504 --> 00:30:18,575
You're just chasin'
 this cat's money.

556
00:30:18,575 --> 00:30:20,404
I mean, it seems
pretty sensible.

557
00:30:20,404 --> 00:30:22,890
He's called the band,
 they're on their way.

558
00:30:22,890 --> 00:30:24,650
Who knows how much
 loot they got?

559
00:30:24,650 --> 00:30:26,341
- Yeah, but, but
 what if Bern's right?

560
00:30:26,341 --> 00:30:28,309
What if this punk and
 his gutterball friends

561
00:30:28,309 --> 00:30:30,276
try to rip us off?

562
00:30:30,276 --> 00:30:31,864
Look at this guy.

563
00:30:33,141 --> 00:30:37,076
- I don't think you have
 to worry about that, baby.

564
00:30:37,076 --> 00:30:38,595
He's on the second
 fifth of whiskey,

565
00:30:38,595 --> 00:30:42,495
and he doesn't seem to give
 a damn about money. [laughs]

566
00:30:43,807 --> 00:30:46,361
He seems like he's got
 a lot of potential.

567
00:30:46,361 --> 00:30:47,846
- Kids these days.

568
00:30:47,846 --> 00:30:49,744
- Here ya go.

569
00:30:51,021 --> 00:30:55,439
- We'll just fill his
 brain with tits and booze

570
00:30:55,439 --> 00:31:00,375
and [laughs] you can
 empty his wallet.

571
00:31:00,375 --> 00:31:01,929
- Yeah.

572
00:31:01,929 --> 00:31:04,241
Even if we can't save the Titty,

573
00:31:04,241 --> 00:31:06,278
you and me, maybe we could, uh,

574
00:31:06,278 --> 00:31:09,798
take some cash, get
outta town for a while.

575
00:31:09,798 --> 00:31:10,834
- We know you've been stickin'

576
00:31:10,834 --> 00:31:15,045
your neck out for us, Spider.

577
00:31:15,045 --> 00:31:16,875
I'll think about it.

578
00:31:19,601 --> 00:31:21,983
[metal door rattles]

579
00:31:23,329 --> 00:31:24,641
- Busy night.

580
00:31:24,641 --> 00:31:25,953
- The hell is it?

581
00:31:25,953 --> 00:31:27,886
Where's Marvin?

582
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:29,818
[metal door crashes]

583
00:31:41,037 --> 00:31:44,557
Hey! Keep it down! Hey!

584
00:31:45,662 --> 00:31:48,113
Look ya crackheads, big
cover tonight, okay?

585
00:31:48,113 --> 00:31:50,632
Private events and
 just get out before I,

586
00:31:50,632 --> 00:31:52,945
get out, before I
 have to throw ya out.

587
00:31:52,945 --> 00:31:54,257
- Braaaaiiiiinsss.

588
00:31:54,257 --> 00:31:55,534

589
00:31:57,812 --> 00:32:00,401
Marvin!

590
00:32:00,401 --> 00:32:03,024
Get your ass in here!

591
00:32:04,646 --> 00:32:07,132
- I told you these
 guys don't leave here.

592
00:32:07,132 --> 00:32:08,029
- Mmmmgggghhh.

593
00:32:08,029 --> 00:32:11,101
- Somebody get him, will ya?

594
00:32:14,035 --> 00:32:15,174
- Oh my!

595
00:32:15,174 --> 00:32:17,487
- I'm workin', you bastard.

596
00:32:20,662 --> 00:32:22,733
Jesus Christ.

597
00:32:24,563 --> 00:32:26,910
- Whiskey.

598
00:32:28,498 --> 00:32:29,948
- Braaaiins.

[Spider shouts]

604
00:32:48,035 --> 00:32:50,589
- Fucking this,
 he fuckin' bit me.

605
00:32:50,589 --> 00:32:53,074
- Get these creeps out of here!

606
00:32:53,074 --> 00:32:54,179
- He fuckin' bit me!

607
00:32:54,179 --> 00:32:56,008
- Stop whinin'!

608
00:32:56,008 --> 00:32:59,115
Bobby, get over here, we're
 throwin' these bums out.

609
00:33:02,359 --> 00:33:04,568
Get your own bum.

610
00:33:04,568 --> 00:33:07,847
I hate this goddamn
 neighborhood.

611
00:33:07,847 --> 00:33:11,851
Freaks and greedy little punks.

612
00:33:13,232 --> 00:33:16,028
We gotta call the
 cops right now.

613
00:33:16,028 --> 00:33:18,824
- Spider, I told you
 somethin' was up.

614
00:33:18,824 --> 00:33:20,757
My hand stings.

615
00:33:20,757 --> 00:33:22,586
Stop it! Come on.

616
00:33:30,629 --> 00:33:33,114
- Wooo, sex and violence,

617
00:33:33,114 --> 00:33:34,495
you fuckin' weirdos
 are all right.

618
00:33:34,495 --> 00:33:36,876
- Oh my God, baby.

619
00:33:36,876 --> 00:33:37,808
Are you okay?

620
00:33:37,808 --> 00:33:39,120
- Fuckin' guy bit me.

621
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:40,949
- Bobby, get on
 the horn, call 911.

622
00:33:40,949 --> 00:33:41,950
This is insane.

623
00:33:41,950 --> 00:33:43,331
- Whoa, whoa, man.

624
00:33:43,331 --> 00:33:45,092
You call the pigs and
 I'll split with the cash.

625
00:33:45,092 --> 00:33:46,472
- Don't leave, Spike.

626
00:33:46,472 --> 00:33:48,302
You just got here.

627
00:33:48,302 --> 00:33:50,787
- Come on, Spider,
 call the cops.

628
00:33:50,787 --> 00:33:53,238
- Oh hell no, Spider,
 don't rain on this parade.

629
00:33:53,238 --> 00:33:55,033
This is my biggest
 night all year.

630
00:33:55,033 --> 00:33:56,965
- All right, think
 about it, baby,

631
00:33:56,965 --> 00:33:58,691
a little bump in the road
 shouldn't stop anything.

632
00:33:58,691 --> 00:34:01,039
I mean, we all need the money.

633
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,281
- Don't be such a pussy, man.

634
00:34:02,281 --> 00:34:04,180
- All right! No cops.

635
00:34:04,180 --> 00:34:06,561
- Come on, Spike, I wanna
 show you the eruption room.

636
00:34:06,561 --> 00:34:08,218
It's really trippy.

637
00:34:08,218 --> 00:34:09,944
- Killer, 'cause
my drummer Rat's

638
00:34:09,944 --> 00:34:11,290
on his way over with the crew,

639
00:34:11,290 --> 00:34:15,467
and a vial full of lethal acid.

640
00:34:15,467 --> 00:34:17,538
- Be careful of that stuff, man.

641
00:34:17,538 --> 00:34:21,680
Hey! What do we have here?

642
00:34:21,680 --> 00:34:25,304
Ha, far out, man.

643
00:34:25,304 --> 00:34:26,512
- Punk asshole.

644
00:34:26,512 --> 00:34:27,893
- Bern, get your butt
 back to the booth.

645
00:34:27,893 --> 00:34:29,550
Bobby, clean this shit up.

646
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:30,551
- Wow.

647
00:34:30,551 --> 00:34:32,898
- Nobody else gets in here!

648
00:34:33,899 --> 00:34:35,280
[door clangs shut]

649
00:34:36,315 --> 00:34:37,868
- You fellas aren't
 closed are ya?

650
00:34:37,868 --> 00:34:40,423
- Actually we are,
 it's a private event.

651
00:34:40,423 --> 00:34:43,184
- Dang it, I just saw three
 guys poundin' on the door.

652
00:34:43,184 --> 00:34:44,496
Must be a heck of a party.

653
00:34:44,496 --> 00:34:47,671
Sure I can't convince
 you to let me join in?

654
00:34:47,671 --> 00:34:51,089
- Cover's 300 bucks.

655
00:34:51,089 --> 00:34:54,851
- [laughs] That's no problem.

656
00:34:54,851 --> 00:34:56,991
Company in here's
certainly more charming

657
00:34:56,991 --> 00:34:59,718
than it is out there.

658
00:34:59,718 --> 00:35:03,101
There you are, my good man.

659
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,620
You may wanna have
 that looked at.

660
00:35:06,794 --> 00:35:08,830
- What brings you to this
 side of town, big shot?

661
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:10,073
- You oughta see it.

662
00:35:10,073 --> 00:35:11,764
They closed down the 405.

663
00:35:11,764 --> 00:35:13,663
Somethin' crazy's goin' on.

664
00:35:13,663 --> 00:35:16,976
So Richard here's cut off
 from the ole ball-and-chain,

665
00:35:16,976 --> 00:35:18,357
what a shame.

666
00:35:18,357 --> 00:35:21,222
So I thought I'd make do
 with some quick easy kicks.

667
00:35:21,222 --> 00:35:24,743
- Oh, well we'll fix
 you up real nice.

668
00:35:24,743 --> 00:35:26,365
- Take real good care of ya.

669
00:35:26,365 --> 00:35:28,919
[laughs] Whatcha drinkin'?

670
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:31,059
- Dirty martini.

671
00:35:31,059 --> 00:35:32,820
And maybe I'll warm myself up

672
00:35:32,820 --> 00:35:34,925
with a nice cup
 of hot chocolate.

673
00:35:34,925 --> 00:35:36,410
- Better watch it 'fore
you wanna put one of

674
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:38,136
these Jimmy Choos up yo' ass.

675
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:40,414
- Oh, baby, is that a promise?

676
00:35:40,414 --> 00:35:41,932
- Come on, let's go.

677
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:44,797
- This is crazy.

678
00:35:44,797 --> 00:35:46,661
What was I thinkin'?

679
00:35:46,661 --> 00:35:48,905
Marvin, watch the door, I
 gotta make a phone call.

680
00:35:48,905 --> 00:35:51,597
- Spider, I really
 don't feel good.

681
00:35:51,597 --> 00:35:55,636
- Oh my God, Marvin,
 baby, are you hurt?

682
00:35:55,636 --> 00:35:57,983
- Of course I'm hurt!

683
00:35:57,983 --> 00:35:59,605
Spider really fucked this up.

684
00:35:59,605 --> 00:36:01,918
Gettin' bit, baby, let's just
 get outta here, okay, come on.

685
00:36:01,918 --> 00:36:03,437
- Let's switch up the flavor.

686
00:36:03,437 --> 00:36:04,783
Jasmine.

687
00:36:04,783 --> 00:36:06,025
- Oops.

688
00:36:06,025 --> 00:36:08,338
- Get your spots right
down to the main stage.

689
00:36:08,338 --> 00:36:10,754
- I'm sorry, Marvin. I gotta go.

690
00:36:10,754 --> 00:36:12,031
- Wait.
 My dance.

691
00:36:12,031 --> 00:36:13,240
- Come on!

692
00:36:14,551 --> 00:36:16,174
- Veterinary school, huh?

693
00:36:16,174 --> 00:36:21,179
- [gasps] I love animals!

694
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:25,804
- All right, buddy,
 loosen your necktie,

695
00:36:25,804 --> 00:36:29,325
'cause it's about to get
real, real hot in here.

696
00:36:29,325 --> 00:36:32,155
Voted Miss Teen Reno 2004,

697
00:36:32,155 --> 00:36:35,745
make those bills fly for our
 Silver State golden girl,

698
00:36:35,745 --> 00:36:37,471
Jasmine.

699
00:36:39,611 --> 00:36:41,095
- Hell yeah.

700
00:36:45,824 --> 00:36:47,205
Shake.

701
00:36:53,141 --> 00:36:54,971
[laughs greedily]

702
00:37:05,947 --> 00:37:07,777
You want it, right?

703
00:37:15,233 --> 00:37:17,062
Bring it here.

704
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:25,553
What a delightful, dirty
little bitch you are.

705
00:37:27,521 --> 00:37:29,626
- Thank you, baby.

706
00:37:33,803 --> 00:37:36,495
- Why don't you
freshen me up, grandma?

707
00:37:36,495 --> 00:37:37,979
- Sure.

708
00:37:40,292 --> 00:37:41,604
Creep.

709
00:37:42,881 --> 00:37:44,779
- What I tell you
 about touching me?

710
00:37:44,779 --> 00:37:47,748
- [laughs] I know I might
 seem pretty square to you,

711
00:37:47,748 --> 00:37:50,268
pretty uptight, but
 don't let it fool ya,

712
00:37:50,268 --> 00:37:53,650
you big big booby Julie,
I got a wild side.

713
00:37:53,650 --> 00:37:54,858
- Is that right?

714
00:37:54,858 --> 00:37:57,275
- Yep, do you know what
they used to call me

715
00:37:57,275 --> 00:37:58,483
in my frat days?

716
00:37:58,483 --> 00:38:00,105
- Oh shit.

717
00:38:02,659 --> 00:38:06,974
- That's right, Ramboner!

718
00:38:08,251 --> 00:38:09,873
[fake gun blasts]

719
00:38:12,290 --> 00:38:13,808
[laughs]

720
00:38:35,140 --> 00:38:38,523
- No service.

721
00:38:38,523 --> 00:38:41,353
Well maybe it's for the best.

722
00:38:41,353 --> 00:38:42,699
We'll make a couple
 grand tonight,

723
00:38:42,699 --> 00:38:46,358
but what about the next night?

724
00:38:46,358 --> 00:38:48,187
- Are you talkin' to
yourself again, Spider?

725
00:38:48,187 --> 00:38:50,155
- I think I'm makin' a mistake.

726
00:38:50,155 --> 00:38:52,122
Listen, I should've
 closed out years ago.

727
00:38:52,122 --> 00:38:53,779
I can't pass this deal up now.

728
00:38:53,779 --> 00:38:55,436
- You're such an
asshole, Spider.

729
00:38:55,436 --> 00:38:56,817
Are you selling the
 place or aren't you?

730
00:38:56,817 --> 00:38:59,992
Make up your goddamned mind!

731
00:39:02,719 --> 00:39:03,927
- The world's gone haywire,

732
00:39:03,927 --> 00:39:07,483
I can't think straight, Sugar.

733
00:39:07,483 --> 00:39:10,693
- Don't say it.

734
00:39:10,693 --> 00:39:13,247
- What would Hambo do?

735
00:39:13,247 --> 00:39:15,076
- This isn't in
 the fucking script!

736
00:39:15,076 --> 00:39:16,802
Charlie! Get these!

737
00:39:16,802 --> 00:39:19,667
Don't bite that! [screams]

738
00:39:23,740 --> 00:39:26,053
- That can't be a good sign.

739
00:39:26,053 --> 00:39:27,606
- What the hell's goin' on?

740
00:39:27,606 --> 00:39:29,746
[Hambo screaming]

741
00:39:32,024 --> 00:39:34,613
- This deadly virus is
spreading like wildfire.

742
00:39:34,613 --> 00:39:36,546
As you can see, local
police have been unable

743
00:39:36,546 --> 00:39:38,686
to restore order to
 the parts of town

744
00:39:38,686 --> 00:39:40,585
now roamed by what some
people are labeling

745
00:39:40,585 --> 00:39:43,311
as the walking dead. [screams]

746
00:39:45,141 --> 00:39:46,970
- Holy shit, is this a joke?

747
00:39:46,970 --> 00:39:50,974
- Whole city's gone to shit.

748
00:39:50,974 --> 00:39:53,287
Sugar, come on, baby,
 let's just skip town,

749
00:39:53,287 --> 00:39:55,185
right now, you and me.

750
00:39:55,185 --> 00:39:57,395
- And leave the Titty?

751
00:39:57,395 --> 00:40:01,226
And the girls? Spider.

752
00:40:01,226 --> 00:40:04,022
[gun fires]

753
00:40:08,716 --> 00:40:09,959
[gun fires]

754
00:40:09,959 --> 00:40:11,788
- Get in there, boys!

755
00:40:11,788 --> 00:40:13,445
[gun fires]

756
00:40:15,240 --> 00:40:17,069
- Was that gun shots?

757
00:40:20,901 --> 00:40:23,006
- Yeah, right there.

758
00:40:25,595 --> 00:40:26,596
- Private event.

759
00:40:26,596 --> 00:40:30,220
- Outta my way, worm stool.

760
00:40:30,220 --> 00:40:32,430
Well, lookee here, boys.

761
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,916
The goddamn rapture
 transpiring outside,

762
00:40:35,916 --> 00:40:38,712
and we find ourselves
smack dab in the middle

763
00:40:38,712 --> 00:40:42,232
of a tiki-themed titty bar.

764
00:40:42,232 --> 00:40:43,371
I'll be.

765
00:40:43,371 --> 00:40:45,443
- Beautiful in a
sense, in a way.

766
00:40:45,443 --> 00:40:48,273
- Yes, Rudy, it 'tis.

767
00:40:50,965 --> 00:40:53,243
We have sinned, boys,

768
00:40:53,243 --> 00:40:58,041
and now the Lord, in
 his infinite wisdom,

769
00:40:58,041 --> 00:41:01,459
is seein' fit to it that we pay.

770
00:41:01,459 --> 00:41:04,323
But not before he
 buys us a drink!

771
00:41:04,323 --> 00:41:05,911
And a lap dance!

772
00:41:05,911 --> 00:41:07,223
- Hell yeah!

773
00:41:07,223 --> 00:41:08,155
- Yeah.

774
00:41:08,155 --> 00:41:10,260
- And now, to silence the source

775
00:41:10,260 --> 00:41:12,470
of that infernal racket.

776
00:41:12,470 --> 00:41:14,472
- Who the hell are you?

777
00:41:14,472 --> 00:41:16,715
- Who the hell am I?

778
00:41:16,715 --> 00:41:20,167
I'm the man who
 just saved the day.

779
00:41:20,167 --> 00:41:21,858
Red Wings is the name,

780
00:41:21,858 --> 00:41:24,965
and this gentleman
 to my left is Rudy,

781
00:41:24,965 --> 00:41:28,555
and this, well,

782
00:41:28,555 --> 00:41:31,178
this here is Goon.

783
00:41:31,178 --> 00:41:33,491
- Hell yeah.

784
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,770
- And you, sir, I presume,
 are the proprietor

785
00:41:36,770 --> 00:41:38,496
of this here establishment.

786
00:41:38,496 --> 00:41:39,980
- Yeah, I am,

787
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:43,466
and I advise you fellas to clear
out before I call the cops.

788
00:41:43,466 --> 00:41:46,296
- The cops.

789
00:41:46,296 --> 00:41:48,747
- [laughs] You hear that, boys?

790
00:41:48,747 --> 00:41:52,648
Why this poor, unfortunate
 cretin is oblivious

791
00:41:52,648 --> 00:41:56,790
to the fact that we are
 currently livin' in end times.

792
00:41:57,756 --> 00:42:01,484
There are no cops, there
are no police, sir.

793
00:42:01,484 --> 00:42:04,280
There are only demons
 roamin' the streets,

794
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:08,042
hungry for the flesh of sinners.

795
00:42:08,042 --> 00:42:10,873
And your obnoxious
music is attractin' them

796
00:42:10,873 --> 00:42:14,532
from every crevice, crack,
 and cranny in this here city.

797
00:42:14,532 --> 00:42:18,397
So if you would
 kindly turn it off?

798
00:42:19,916 --> 00:42:22,747
We all might just survive.

799
00:42:22,747 --> 00:42:24,438
- What the hell are
 you talking about?

800
00:42:24,438 --> 00:42:27,303
Marvin, you let these
 assholes in my bar?

801
00:42:29,339 --> 00:42:32,170
- We let ourselves in.

802
00:42:34,931 --> 00:42:37,865
- All right, all right,
cut the music, Bern.

803
00:42:37,865 --> 00:42:39,073
[music screeches off]

804
00:42:40,247 --> 00:42:41,662
- We heard shooting.

805
00:42:41,662 --> 00:42:44,665
- This night just keeps
 gettin' better and better.

806
00:42:44,665 --> 00:42:48,669
- Shit, man, I thought
 I was just baked.

807
00:42:48,669 --> 00:42:52,293
Are we getting robbed?

808
00:42:52,293 --> 00:42:54,261
- Watch out, 'cause this
motherfucker is crazy.

809
00:42:54,261 --> 00:42:55,711
- Why'd the music stop?

810
00:42:55,711 --> 00:42:58,299
I'm not payin' out the ass
 so my dick can go limp.

811
00:42:58,299 --> 00:43:00,612
I demand to speak
 to the management.

812
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:02,752
- New management, sir.

813
00:43:02,752 --> 00:43:06,791
The Gravediggers are
 officially assuming control

814
00:43:06,791 --> 00:43:08,516
of this here saloon.

815
00:43:08,516 --> 00:43:11,381
- Like hell you are!

816
00:43:11,381 --> 00:43:12,762
[gun cocks]

817
00:43:14,281 --> 00:43:15,316
- He's got a gun!

818
00:43:15,316 --> 00:43:16,594
- No shit, honey.

819
00:43:16,594 --> 00:43:19,010
- Not another inch, sir.

820
00:43:19,010 --> 00:43:21,288
[gun fires]

821
00:43:22,876 --> 00:43:27,605
- Everybody just take a
couple of deep breaths.

822
00:43:30,021 --> 00:43:33,196
- So, it has come to this.

823
00:43:33,196 --> 00:43:37,684
The proverbial Mexican standoff.

824
00:43:37,684 --> 00:43:39,824
Here we are, boys, offerin'

825
00:43:39,824 --> 00:43:42,965
our aid, comfort, and good will,

826
00:43:42,965 --> 00:43:44,794
and what are met with?

827
00:43:44,794 --> 00:43:47,452
Obstinate resistance.

828
00:43:47,452 --> 00:43:50,075
I do declare,

829
00:43:50,075 --> 00:43:53,216
we shall all be walkin'
dead by sunrise.

830
00:43:53,216 --> 00:43:54,493
- What is this?

831
00:43:54,493 --> 00:43:57,186
What's everyone goin'
on about a walking dead?

832
00:43:57,186 --> 00:43:58,739
What the fuck is
 happening out there?

833
00:43:58,739 --> 00:44:02,985
- Livin' corpses, this city is
 crawlin' with livin' corpses.

834
00:44:02,985 --> 00:44:07,299
One bite, and you become a
 new recruit for Satan's army.

835
00:44:08,369 --> 00:44:11,200
- Shit, so, all the freaks
 we've been encountering

836
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:14,203
this evening,
 they're diseased or?

837
00:44:14,203 --> 00:44:15,687
- Well how did it
 spread so fast?

838
00:44:15,687 --> 00:44:20,140
- Bitin', clawin', scratchin',
 fluid transmission.

839
00:44:20,140 --> 00:44:23,315
- Just like every STD
 you ever had, Sugar.

840
00:44:23,315 --> 00:44:26,456
- Biting?

841
00:44:26,456 --> 00:44:28,562
Come on, baby, get up, Marvin.

842
00:44:28,562 --> 00:44:29,908
Baby, let's go.

843
00:44:29,908 --> 00:44:32,083
- Where do you tink you're
 goin' to, sweet pea?

844
00:44:32,083 --> 00:44:33,981
- To give him one
 last lap dance.

845
00:44:33,981 --> 00:44:35,949
It's the end of
 the world, right?

846
00:44:35,949 --> 00:44:37,295
[door slams]

847
00:44:38,330 --> 00:44:40,401
- Aw shit!

848
00:44:40,401 --> 00:44:42,541
- Fuckin' finally,
 the band's here.

849
00:44:44,474 --> 00:44:46,649
Man, you guys look wasted.

850

[gun fires]

852
00:44:55,727 --> 00:44:57,177
- You fuckin' crazy?

853
00:44:57,177 --> 00:44:58,488
You just brained my bassist!

854
00:44:58,488 --> 00:44:59,973
- You little perv!

855
00:44:59,973 --> 00:45:01,733
Get back! All of ya, get back!

856
00:45:02,803 --> 00:45:03,942
[gun fires]

857
00:45:03,942 --> 00:45:06,807
- This is worse
 than Al-da-mon, man.

858
00:45:08,119 --> 00:45:09,603
- You ain't fuckin' in my house.

859
00:45:09,603 --> 00:45:11,847
- Blaaaraaach.

860
00:45:15,402 --> 00:45:17,576
- I'm out!

861
00:45:17,576 --> 00:45:19,544
[Sugar screams]

862
00:45:20,614 --> 00:45:22,202
- Get him, Bobby!

863
00:45:25,205 --> 00:45:27,138
[fleshy grinding]

864
00:45:29,071 --> 00:45:30,969
[zombies growl]

865
00:45:33,627 --> 00:45:35,940
- Get the fuck
 away from me, dude.

866
00:45:37,976 --> 00:45:40,807
[Sugar grunts]

867
00:45:40,807 --> 00:45:42,222
[fleshy, bloody thunks]

868
00:45:47,089 --> 00:45:48,953
- Ain't gonna happen.

869
00:45:54,234 --> 00:45:56,754
- Man, come on, man,
 mellow out, dude.

870
00:46:00,585 --> 00:46:02,276
Just hit it, it's cool.

871
00:46:06,902 --> 00:46:08,006

[Bern screams]

873
00:46:08,835 --> 00:46:10,491
Ow, dude, come on.

I can't die in a

879
00:46:28,302 --> 00:46:30,408

880
00:46:30,408 --> 00:46:31,961
I'll make it all better.

881
00:46:31,961 --> 00:46:34,653
- Fuckin' burns.

882
00:46:34,653 --> 00:46:36,586
I burn.

Oh Jesus! Fuck!

Oh my dear boy, I
 will miss him so.

 did I not warn you?

Have I been wrong
 about anything yet?

 think of something.

He always does.

- Screw Spider!

00:49:28,310 --> 00:49:29,967
It's his fault
 we're in this mess,

935
00:49:29,967 --> 00:49:31,071

how many times did I tell him?

00:49:32,314 --> 00:49:35,489
So many times, and did
 he listen to me, no!

938
00:49:35,489 --> 00:49:38,389
And I work my ass off
 and I never complain,

939
00:49:38,389 --> 00:49:41,633

 thanks do I get?

And I don't feel my junk.

944
00:49:53,093 --> 00:49:58,098
- Jeez, well, I'm
 no paramedic...

945
00:49:59,548 --> 00:50:02,654
but, maybe,

946
00:50:02,654 --> 00:50:04,932
there's something I can do

947
00:50:04,932 --> 00:50:07,176
to bring the feeling back.

948
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,562
- Arrrggghhhh.

949
00:50:13,562 --> 00:50:15,598
- Puncture the brains.

950
00:50:15,598 --> 00:50:17,704

hole in your head, son.

- Yeah, there's no monsters,

958
00:50:32,098 --> 00:50:35,032
but there's guts
 all over the place.

- Yeah there are.

00:50:36,309 --> 00:50:37,793
- Spike!

- Oh, let's, uh, get you
 cleaned up, babe, come on.

962
00:50:40,037 --> 00:50:41,900
- No time for clean up, kiddies.

 in some sensible clothing.

but that's a reasonably
responsible young man.

967
00:50:53,084 --> 00:50:54,465
Hurry back, son.

968
00:50:54,465 --> 00:50:56,398
- I think I have
 something really sensible

969
00:50:56,398 --> 00:50:58,227
in the dressing room.

 an end to that cacophony.

- Turn off the music, Bern!

Where the hell is
 that goddamn pothead?

977
00:51:22,389 --> 00:51:23,873
- Brains!

00:51:23,873 --> 00:51:26,221
- Oh shit, man, look, Bryce,
 you're high as a kite.

979

This is no time
 to be tuning out.

Shit! [screams incoherently]

986

on drugs, motherfucker.

 how to work her heels.

 wanna a drink?

 for libation, lady.

Grab what you can!

992
00:52:01,877 --> 00:52:04,121
We must barricade those doors.

993
00:52:04,121 --> 00:52:06,192

spendin' another minute

994
00:52:06,192 --> 00:52:08,055
in this deathtrap, I
 gotta get outta here,

995
00:52:08,055 --> 00:52:09,954
I got a wife and kids in Encino.

996
00:52:09,954 --> 00:52:13,578
- Oh so now you care
 about your family.

997
00:52:13,578 --> 00:52:14,959
- I'm with the suit.

998
00:52:14,959 --> 00:52:16,616
I seen what you did
 to Goon, Red Wings,

999
00:52:16,616 --> 00:52:19,791
and I can't hang with a man
 what kills his own road dog.

1000
00:52:19,791 --> 00:52:21,379
- This meth-head robot's right.

1001
00:52:21,379 --> 00:52:22,760
You people are nuts!

1002
00:52:22,760 --> 00:52:25,659
- Rudy, use your head, man.

1003
00:52:25,659 --> 00:52:27,937
I spared Goon a fate
 worse than death.

1004
00:52:27,937 --> 00:52:29,732
- You popped him in the
head like a sick pup.

1005
00:52:29,732 --> 00:52:31,700
- Had I not, he would've
roamed the earth

1006
00:52:31,700 --> 00:52:34,047
as one of these
 accursed hellions.

1007
00:52:34,047 --> 00:52:36,946
I delivered him unto
 the bosom of the Lord!

1008
00:52:36,946 --> 00:52:38,603
- I don't know about
 the bosom of the Lord,

1009
00:52:38,603 --> 00:52:40,467
but we're all safe
 here in the Titty

1010
00:52:40,467 --> 00:52:43,332
as long as we stick together.

1011
00:52:43,332 --> 00:52:47,129
Now come on, folks, we
 gotta build us a barricade.

1012
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,276
- Do you think this
 was fate, Spike?

1013
00:52:56,276 --> 00:52:59,417
- Yeah, whatever, maybe.

1014
00:52:59,417 --> 00:53:01,178
- Baby, I don't know
 if it's just because

1015
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:04,698
of the apocalypse or what,
 but I'm really turned on.

1016
00:53:04,698 --> 00:53:08,426
- You're a freak,
 just embrace it.

1017
00:53:08,426 --> 00:53:13,397
- Spike, if we make it out of
 this alive, let's get hitched.

1018
00:53:13,397 --> 00:53:15,571
I mean, we're so good together.

1019
00:53:15,571 --> 00:53:17,573
We could support each other.

1020
00:53:17,573 --> 00:53:20,197
I just know you can change
 the world with your music.

1021
00:53:20,197 --> 00:53:21,957
- Yeah, and you can take
 care of all the dead people's

1022
00:53:21,957 --> 00:53:23,372
little doggies, too.

1023
00:53:23,372 --> 00:53:26,306
But you gotta start
 with me first.

1024
00:53:26,306 --> 00:53:28,274
- I'm so lucky!

1025
00:53:30,310 --> 00:53:34,901
- Do you like that, baby?

1026
00:53:34,901 --> 00:53:37,662
- I can barely see.

1027
00:53:37,662 --> 00:53:39,285
I'm so stiff.

1028
00:53:39,285 --> 00:53:43,358
- That's right,
 talk dirty to me.

1029
00:53:43,358 --> 00:53:47,776
- Wow, it's beautiful.

1030
00:53:47,776 --> 00:53:52,746
- Aw, Marvin, you're the
sweetest guy I ever danced for.

1031
00:53:53,954 --> 00:53:57,510
- Go in to the light, big guy.

1032
00:53:57,510 --> 00:53:59,374
I'm so close.

1033
00:53:59,374 --> 00:54:02,549
- It's okay, baby, you can come.

1034
00:54:02,549 --> 00:54:03,757
[Marvin wheezes]

1035
00:54:03,757 --> 00:54:05,759
Um, yeah.

1036
00:54:15,942 --> 00:54:18,738
- Last chance to stay,
 boys, you understand that?

1037
00:54:18,738 --> 00:54:19,911
Once you dipshits leave,

1038
00:54:19,911 --> 00:54:21,913
we're boardin' it
 up for good, right?

1039
00:54:21,913 --> 00:54:23,467
- I'll take my
 chance with the road.

1040
00:54:23,467 --> 00:54:25,883
- Well, I guess you
 can't deny a man that.

1041
00:54:25,883 --> 00:54:28,092
God speed, Rudy,
 you stupid bastard.

1042
00:54:28,092 --> 00:54:30,059
- Cut the crap, let's bolt!

1043
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:31,923
- Y'all fools know
 you gonna die, right?

1044
00:54:31,923 --> 00:54:33,235
- You bitches will say anything

1045
00:54:33,235 --> 00:54:34,961
to keep a man in
 this nest long enough

1046
00:54:34,961 --> 00:54:36,514
to bleed his wallet dry.

1047
00:54:36,514 --> 00:54:38,102
Well not tonight, sweetheart.

1048
00:54:38,102 --> 00:54:39,517
- Oh no, please stay.

1049
00:54:39,517 --> 00:54:42,555
- Sorry, saggy, but I'm
 takin' my business elsewhere.

1050
00:54:42,555 --> 00:54:43,970
Let's do this, voice box.

1051
00:54:43,970 --> 00:54:46,179
- On the count of
 three, let us out.

1052
00:54:46,179 --> 00:54:49,838
One, two, three.

1053
00:54:54,498 --> 00:54:58,156
[Rudy screams electronically]

1054
00:54:59,399 --> 00:55:01,194
[zombies growl]

1055
00:55:06,613 --> 00:55:08,166
- Oh.

1056
00:55:10,030 --> 00:55:13,448
I changed my mind, I was just
 gettin' some fresh air's all.

1057
00:55:14,863 --> 00:55:18,349
Open the door!

1058
00:55:18,349 --> 00:55:22,871
Come on, you cocksuckers!
 Open the door!

1059
00:55:22,871 --> 00:55:24,390
Have a heart!

1060
00:55:26,392 --> 00:55:29,049
[zombie growls]

1061
00:55:33,744 --> 00:55:36,263
- No time to mourn
 the fools among us

1062
00:55:36,263 --> 00:55:39,784
while the razor's edge
 upon which the living walk,

1063
00:55:39,784 --> 00:55:42,131
is still so very tenuous.

1064
00:55:42,131 --> 00:55:43,754
- That's some poetic shit.

1065
00:55:43,754 --> 00:55:46,066
How'd you get the
 name Red Wings anyway?

1066
00:55:46,066 --> 00:55:49,346
- Well, my dear, in the
motorcycle community,

1067
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:53,867
in which I am somethin'
of a member emeritus,

1068
00:55:53,867 --> 00:55:58,424
we reward one another for
 our sexual accomplishments.

1069
00:55:58,424 --> 00:56:01,358
In my days as a sinner,

1070
00:56:01,358 --> 00:56:03,739
I was quite accomplished.

1071
00:56:03,739 --> 00:56:06,052
- Oh please spare
 us the sex talk.

1072
00:56:06,052 --> 00:56:08,054
- You see, while
 most men do not deign

1073
00:56:08,054 --> 00:56:12,783
to please a woman durin'
 her monthly visitations--

1074
00:56:12,783 --> 00:56:14,198
- It means he's a bloodsucker.

1075
00:56:14,198 --> 00:56:17,132
- Damn, boy, you nasty!

1076
00:56:17,132 --> 00:56:19,168
- Indeed.

1077
00:56:19,168 --> 00:56:20,307
- Well let's not get distracted.

1078
00:56:20,307 --> 00:56:21,481
Keep pilin' it on.

1079
00:56:21,481 --> 00:56:23,103
- You really think
 this junk'll hold 'em?

1080
00:56:23,103 --> 00:56:24,311
- Shit, it better.

1081
00:56:24,311 --> 00:56:26,521
- We could use a few
 more hands on deck.

1082
00:56:26,521 --> 00:56:29,489
- Yeah, where the fuck is
 Marvin, useless bastard.

1083
00:56:29,489 --> 00:56:31,146
I'm gonna go shout
 him a new one.

1084
00:56:31,146 --> 00:56:33,079
- Spider, wait.

1085
00:56:33,079 --> 00:56:35,219
[metal door clangs]

1086
00:56:35,219 --> 00:56:36,703
[zombies growl]

1087
00:56:38,084 --> 00:56:41,743
- What if this whole thing was
 some kind of reality pilot?

1088
00:56:41,743 --> 00:56:45,125
And Ashton Kutcher or
 whatever bursts in?

1089
00:56:45,125 --> 00:56:47,576
We could totally be famous.

1090
00:56:47,576 --> 00:56:49,026
- Ahhhhhhhh.

1091
00:56:49,026 --> 00:56:51,822
- Yeah, wishful thinking.

1092
00:56:51,822 --> 00:56:53,030
- Uhhhhhh.

1093
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:55,481
- It's just, like,
 it's so sad to be

1094
00:56:55,481 --> 00:56:58,415
this pretty and not on TV.

1095
00:56:58,415 --> 00:57:00,106
What's wrong with the world?

1096
00:57:00,106 --> 00:57:01,832
- Ehhhhhhhhhhh.

1097
00:57:01,832 --> 00:57:04,973
- You're right,
 it's totally unfair.

1098
00:57:04,973 --> 00:57:09,149
Oh my God, Marv, you're
such a good listener.

1099
00:57:09,149 --> 00:57:10,530
- Aggghhhhh.

1100
00:57:10,530 --> 00:57:13,291
- I can't believe
 it took all this

1101
00:57:13,291 --> 00:57:16,329
for us to, like,
 get close, you know?

1102
00:57:16,329 --> 00:57:20,333
I see you watching me while
 I'm up on that pole, baby.

1103
00:57:20,333 --> 00:57:24,406
The way you hide your
 eyes, it's so sweet.

1104
00:57:27,029 --> 00:57:28,686
- Uggghhhh.

1105
00:57:28,686 --> 00:57:31,275
- You know,

1106
00:57:31,275 --> 00:57:34,174
since this world is ending

1107
00:57:34,174 --> 00:57:37,592
in this really crazy
 way, maybe I can go ahead

1108
00:57:37,592 --> 00:57:39,801
and ignore my third date rule.

1109
00:57:39,801 --> 00:57:41,734
- Uhhhhhhhhh.

1110
00:57:41,734 --> 00:57:44,806
- Ah, slow down there, cowboy.

1111
00:57:44,806 --> 00:57:47,567
First you have to say what
 you like best about me.

1112
00:57:47,567 --> 00:57:50,328
- Brrraaaaainnnns.

1113
00:57:50,328 --> 00:57:52,745
- Marvin, that's like
 the sweetest thing

1114
00:57:52,745 --> 00:57:54,712
anyone's ever said to me.

1115
00:57:56,162 --> 00:57:58,647
[Jasmine screams]

1116
00:58:02,409 --> 00:58:04,929
- That flimsy pile of
 furniture is not gonna hold.

1117
00:58:04,929 --> 00:58:06,206
- Not a chance.

1118
00:58:06,206 --> 00:58:08,139
- It's gonna buy us some
time, but you're right,

1119
00:58:08,139 --> 00:58:09,727
we need to ditch the Titty.

1120
00:58:09,727 --> 00:58:11,280
- And risk the streets
 out there at night?

1121
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:13,213
You saw what happened
 to those two.

1122
00:58:13,213 --> 00:58:15,215
- Then I am shit out of ideas.

1123
00:58:15,215 --> 00:58:17,390
- Look, I got a plan.

1124
00:58:20,358 --> 00:58:23,085
We reinforce the
 barricade best we can,

1125
00:58:23,085 --> 00:58:25,812
wrangle everyone
 together, gather supplies.

1126
00:58:25,812 --> 00:58:29,506
Soon as the sun is up, we
 just head right up the--

1127
00:58:29,506 --> 00:58:31,577
- What?What? What? What?

1128
00:58:31,577 --> 00:58:35,063
- Backdoor, Marvin never
locked it, the useless bastard!

1129
00:58:35,063 --> 00:58:37,859
- Oh my God, you've
 got to be kiddin' me.

1130
00:58:37,859 --> 00:58:40,896
- Grab the deadliest
 weapon you can find.

1131
00:58:40,896 --> 00:58:42,139
- Deadliest weapon I can find,

1132
00:58:42,139 --> 00:58:44,555
this place is made of
 fucking palm fronds!

1133
00:58:53,944 --> 00:58:55,290
- Are you serious?

1134
00:58:55,290 --> 00:58:56,878
- 151 proof.

1135
00:58:56,878 --> 00:58:58,327
- Gotta hand it to you, Sugar,

1136
00:58:58,327 --> 00:58:59,846
even in times of crisis,
 you're fucking hilarious.

1137
00:58:59,846 --> 00:59:01,641
Let's roll.

1138
00:59:01,641 --> 00:59:04,402
[zombies squeal and groan]

1139
00:59:21,765 --> 00:59:23,076
What on earth is that?

1140
00:59:23,076 --> 00:59:25,631
- That's the dressing room.

1141
00:59:28,979 --> 00:59:32,154
- Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah, yeah.

1142
00:59:33,570 --> 00:59:36,124
Oh, oh, oh

1143
00:59:36,124 --> 00:59:37,228
- Fuck.

1144
00:59:37,228 --> 00:59:40,162
- Talk about wakin' the dead.

1145
00:59:40,162 --> 00:59:42,130
- That's not funny, Sugar.

1146
00:59:42,130 --> 00:59:44,684
Am I the only one who's aware
 of the situation around here?

1147
00:59:44,684 --> 00:59:45,927
- It's not what it looks like.

1148
00:59:45,927 --> 00:59:47,307
- Hell yeah it is.

1149
00:59:47,307 --> 00:59:49,102
- Jesus, you two jackrabbits,
 get your clothes on

1150
00:59:49,102 --> 00:59:51,380
and go help at the barricade.

1151
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:53,935
Right fuckin' now!

1152
01:00:01,736 --> 01:00:04,670
Shit! Come on back this way.

1153
01:00:06,810 --> 01:00:09,122
[zombie growls]

1154
01:00:10,814 --> 01:00:13,402
Not you, too, Hambo.

1155
01:00:13,402 --> 01:00:17,372
- Ahhggghhhh.

1156
01:00:17,372 --> 01:00:18,925
- Kill it, kill it, kill it.

1157
01:00:18,925 --> 01:00:21,376
Kill it! Kill it! Kill it!

1158
01:00:21,376 --> 01:00:24,068
- I can't do it!

1159
01:00:26,381 --> 01:00:29,453
You really messed up
 this time, shithead!

1160
01:00:29,453 --> 01:00:32,870
I told you to lock
 that goddamned door!

1161
01:00:32,870 --> 01:00:34,458
Marvin?

1162
01:00:37,116 --> 01:00:38,773
You know what your problem is.

1163
01:00:38,773 --> 01:00:40,740
- Braaaaainnnns!

1164
01:00:40,740 --> 01:00:42,639
- Yeah you ain't got 'em.

1165
01:00:44,054 --> 01:00:45,400
- Open the goddamn door!

1166
01:00:45,400 --> 01:00:47,091
Open the fuckin' door!

1167
01:00:47,091 --> 01:00:48,990
Open the door, Spider!

1168
01:00:48,990 --> 01:00:50,785
Open the door!

1169
01:00:54,305 --> 01:00:56,066
[zombie growls]

1170
01:01:05,834 --> 01:01:08,457
- Looks that'd kill.

1171
01:01:08,457 --> 01:01:09,907
I admire that.

1172
01:01:09,907 --> 01:01:12,599
- Yeah, well I like man who
 knows how to work his wood.

1173
01:01:12,599 --> 01:01:15,982
- [laughs] Touche, my sweet.

1174
01:01:15,982 --> 01:01:17,328
- Sorry we're late
 for the party.

1175
01:01:17,328 --> 01:01:19,054
- Where the hell
 have you two been?

1176
01:01:19,054 --> 01:01:20,435
We were startin' to worry.

1177
01:01:20,435 --> 01:01:22,264
- We were, um--

1178
01:01:22,264 --> 01:01:26,268
- If I'm not mistaken,
 and I seldom am,

1179
01:01:26,268 --> 01:01:27,822
I do believe I detect

1180
01:01:27,822 --> 01:01:32,654
the pungent, earthy
 aroma of young love.

1181
01:01:32,654 --> 01:01:36,106
- Aw hell no,
those ashy-skinned,
brain-eatin' crackheads

1182
01:01:36,106 --> 01:01:37,797
out there are tryin' to get in,

1183
01:01:37,797 --> 01:01:40,041
and y'all back
 there gettin' it on?

1184
01:01:40,041 --> 01:01:41,111
I oughta whup

1185
01:01:41,111 --> 01:01:42,595
your ass.
- Now hold on, my dear.

1186
01:01:42,595 --> 01:01:45,702
It is not uncommon
 during a crisis situation

1187
01:01:45,702 --> 01:01:50,361
for an individual to
 become thoroughly aroused.

1188
01:01:50,361 --> 01:01:55,056
After all, should we
survive this cataclysm,

1189
01:01:55,056 --> 01:01:58,853
it will be our sacred
 duty to repopulate

1190
01:01:58,853 --> 01:02:01,441
this once great republic.

1191
01:02:01,441 --> 01:02:04,099
- What the hell are
 you talkin' about?

1192
01:02:04,099 --> 01:02:06,343
- I'm talkin about gettin it on,

1193
01:02:06,343 --> 01:02:07,931
as you so aptly put it.

1194
01:02:07,931 --> 01:02:09,242
- Spike and I are
 doing our part.

1195
01:02:09,242 --> 01:02:10,623
- Fuck that, I'm wrappin' it.

1196
01:02:10,623 --> 01:02:14,834
- Red Wings, you get us
out of this mess alive,

1197
01:02:14,834 --> 01:02:18,044
and I will strip you
 down, grease you up,

1198
01:02:18,044 --> 01:02:21,876
and bang you 76 ways to Sunday.

1199
01:02:21,876 --> 01:02:24,119
And tie your boots, too.

1200
01:02:25,638 --> 01:02:27,985
- And, and tie my boots?

1201
01:02:27,985 --> 01:02:30,885
Why, even I've never
 heard of that one.

1202
01:02:30,885 --> 01:02:32,058
What's it mean?

1203
01:02:32,058 --> 01:02:33,853
- It means your
 boots are untied.

1204
01:02:33,853 --> 01:02:36,580
- How charmingly observant.

1205
01:02:36,580 --> 01:02:38,616
- Watch out!

1206
01:02:38,616 --> 01:02:42,068
[Red Wings screams]

1207
01:02:42,068 --> 01:02:44,208
- You whore!

1208
01:02:44,208 --> 01:02:47,315
- Always tryin' to upstage me.

1209
01:02:47,315 --> 01:02:49,835
I know you always
wanted my Prada, bitch.

1210
01:02:49,835 --> 01:02:52,354
Well now you got it.

1211

[blood squirting]

1212
01:02:54,460 --> 01:02:58,153
- You sure are on hell of
 a woman, sugar britches.

1213
01:02:58,153 --> 01:03:00,052
- Damn straight.

1214
01:03:00,052 --> 01:03:03,193
- You know what you must do now.

1215
01:03:03,193 --> 01:03:07,749
Deliver me unto the
 bosom of the Lord.

1216
01:03:07,749 --> 01:03:10,407
Yea, though I walk
 through the valley

1217
01:03:10,407 --> 01:03:11,995
of the shadow of death--

[Vanilla grunts]

1219
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:16,965
- See you in gangster's
paradise, baby.
