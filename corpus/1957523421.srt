KHADIJAH:
Marie Schmidt.

367
00:27:56,808 --> 00:27:58,008
Agent with the BND.

368
00:27:58,041 --> 00:27:59,774
- What?
- Demolitions,

369
00:27:59,808 --> 00:28:01,609
disobedience, demotions.

370
00:28:01,642 --> 00:28:05,141
Uh, always under suspicion
of being a double agent.

371
00:28:05,176 --> 00:28:07,141
Why?

372
00:28:07,176 --> 00:28:08,708
KHADIJAH:
Her father.

373
00:28:08,741 --> 00:28:11,741
Sold secrets to the Russians
in the early '90s.

374
00:28:11,774 --> 00:28:14,141
Got caught
when she was very young.

375

Hmm, looks like
it runs in the family.

376

No partner, no husband,

382

How'd he get the drive
in the first place?

389
00:28:45,841 --> 00:28:47,609
Hmm, grabbed it
in a cartel raid.

390
00:28:47,641 --> 00:28:49,442
Idiot didn't even know
what he had.

391
00:28:49,475 --> 00:28:51,674

It's a blind spot.

395

Can you get
a satellite or something

396
00:29:00,209 --> 00:29:02,741
- so we can see in there?
- The definition of "blind"

397
00:29:02,774 --> 00:29:03,975
is "can't see."

398

didn't see the signs, right?

1422
01:28:41,034 --> 01:28:42,834
When you live a life of lies,

1423
01:28:42,867 --> 01:28:45,767
it's hard to know
what's true and what isn't.

1424
01:28:48,900 --> 01:28:50,900
I thought I knew.

1425
01:28:52,800 --> 01:28:56,734
I was in control my whole life.

1426
01:28:59,167 --> 01:29:01,800
I took care of myself because...

1427
01:29:06,767 --> 01:29:08,934
...I didn't have anybody.

1428
01:29:12,300 --> 01:29:14,166
I got used to that life.

1429
01:29:14,200 --> 01:29:18,499
It made me
really, really good...

1430
01:29:19,566 --> 01:29:21,700
...at this life.

1431
01:29:23,300 --> 01:29:25,867
I'm sorry you were betrayed.

1432
01:29:27,067 --> 01:29:28,867

1433

Mm-mm.

1435
01:29:42,067 --> 01:29:43,633

1436
01:29:47,867 --> 01:29:49,034

1437
01:29:54,700 --> 01:29:55,867

01:30:22,566 --> 01:30:25,266
Mm. Hoping for some of that tea.

1446
01:30:25,300 --> 01:30:26,700
I'm starting to feel
my face again.

1447
01:30:26,734 --> 01:30:30,034
Chinese herbs
have many qualities.

1448
01:30:31,667 --> 01:30:34,767
This will end your pain forever.

1449
01:30:36,034 --> 01:30:38,767
Let me find something
a little less strong.

1450
01:30:41,067 --> 01:30:42,700
So what'd you give 'em?

1451
01:30:42,734 --> 01:30:45,001
You have the drive.
You gave them something else.

1452
01:30:45,034 --> 01:30:46,767
We gave them something close.

1453
01:30:46,800 --> 01:30:49,667
That was
a dangerous thing to do.

1454
01:30:50,300 --> 01:30:52,266
That's what we do.

1455
01:30:52,300 --> 01:30:53,633
Right?

1456
01:30:53,667 --> 01:30:56,834
We put ourselves in danger...

1457
01:30:57,767 --> 01:31:00,100
...so that others are not.

1458
01:31:01,001 --> 01:31:05,200
We all look different,
speak different,

1459
01:31:05,233 --> 01:31:08,133
but we are the same.

1460
01:31:08,166 --> 01:31:10,100

1461
01:31:15,567 --> 01:31:19,166

so beautiful can be so deadly.

1462
01:31:19,200 --> 01:31:22,633
The way these containers
are set up...

1463
01:31:24,834 --> 01:31:27,033
There's no safeguard
for them yet.

Uh-uh.

of this and do as you're told.

- Give it to them!
