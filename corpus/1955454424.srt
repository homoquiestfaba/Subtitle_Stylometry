1
00:00:56,649 --> 00:00:58,932
<i>They say that history is
written by the victors.</i>

2
00:00:59,660 --> 00:01:03,140
<i>This then, is the history
of the Umbrella Corporation.</i>

3
00:01:03,609 --> 00:01:07,059
<i>Formed by crusading scientist,
Professor James Marcus.</i>

4
00:01:07,094 --> 00:01:10,692
<i>Marcus had a young daughter,
Alicia, afflicted with progeria,</i>

5
00:01:10,727 --> 00:01:13,077
<i>a progressive, fatal,
wasting disease.</i>

6
00:01:13,234 --> 00:01:15,365
<i>Progeria caused premature aging.</i>

7
00:01:15,400 --> 00:01:20,121
<i>By the time she was 25,
Alicia would have the body of a 90 year old.</i>

8
00:01:20,783 --> 00:01:22,677
<i>Marcus was driven to save her.</i>

9
00:01:22,712 --> 00:01:24,984
<i>But the odds seemed impossible.</i>

10
00:01:25,019 --> 00:01:27,842
<i>And even as he worked
desperately to create a cure,</i>

11
00:01:27,877 --> 00:01:30,557
<i>the young girl's father
would record his daughter,</i>

12
00:01:30,592 --> 00:01:34,331
<i>her voice, her likeness,
saving her for posterity.</i>

13
00:01:36,599 --> 00:01:39,749
<i>But then a breakthrough came.
Marcus discovered the T-Virus.</i>

14
00:01:39,784 --> 00:01:43,456
<i>Once injected, it would detect and
repair damaged cells within the body.</i>

15
00:01:44,291 --> 00:01:45,191
<i>It was a miracle.</i>

16
00:01:45,762 --> 00:01:49,940
<i>The life of Alicia
Marcus was saved.</i>

17
00:01:50,725 --> 00:01:52,995
<i>The T-Virus had a
myriad of applications,</i>

18
00:01:53,195 --> 00:01:55,354
<i>treating a thousand
different diseases.</i>

19
00:01:55,389 --> 00:01:58,296
<i>Overnight,
it seemed a new era was dawning.</i>

20
00:01:58,331 --> 00:02:02,587
<i>A world without the fear of
infection, sickness or decay.</i>

21
00:02:04,135 --> 00:02:05,929
<i>But it was not to be.</i>

22
00:02:05,930 --> 00:02:09,618
<i>For the T-Virus had certain,
unforeseen side effects.</i>

23
00:02:19,855 --> 00:02:21,555
<i>Sir, sir, over here!</i>

24
00:02:26,072 --> 00:02:27,772
<i>He's not breathing.</i>

25
00:02:55,402 --> 00:02:57,526
<i>The first of the undead was born.</i>

26
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,140
<i>The incident was quickly covered up.</i>

27
00:03:00,175 --> 00:03:04,168
<i>In the aftermath, James Marcus argued
furiously with his business partner,</i>

28
00:03:04,203 --> 00:03:06,394
<i>Dr. Alexander Isaacs.</i>

29
00:03:06,429 --> 00:03:10,112
<i>I don't care how much it costs.
We have to close the program down.</i>

30
00:03:10,147 --> 00:03:14,341
<i>- James, we're gonna be ruined.
- My mind is made up.</i>

31
00:03:16,682 --> 00:03:18,382
<i>Pity.</i>

32
00:03:29,356 --> 00:03:33,102
<i>Off to bed, Alicia. Your
father and I are just talking.</i>

33
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:36,533
<i>Go on.</i>

34
00:03:44,713 --> 00:03:47,584
<i>Dr. Isaacs became the guardian
of his dead partner's child.</i>

35
00:03:47,619 --> 00:03:49,871
<i>And her half of the company.</i>

36
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:54,082
<i>The corporation that had
begun with such lofty ideals,</i>

37
00:03:54,330 --> 00:03:57,500
<i>had been seduced completely
by greed, and power.</i>

38
00:03:59,755 --> 00:04:03,277
<i>To help him control the now vast
interests of the Umbrella Corporation,</i>

39
00:04:04,147 --> 00:04:07,223
<i>Dr. Isaacs created a powerful
artificial intelligence.</i>

40
00:04:08,447 --> 00:04:11,807
<i>Isaacs used the likeness of Alicia
Marcus for the computer's interface.</i>

41
00:04:13,047 --> 00:04:16,181
<i>Isaacs called the computer
The Red Queen.</i>

42
00:04:18,654 --> 00:04:22,400
<i>Then, 10 years ago in Raccoon City,
there was an outbreak.</i>

43
00:04:22,435 --> 00:04:26,377
<i>The T-virus escaped from an underground
laboratory called The Hive.</i>

44
00:04:26,806 --> 00:04:31,093
<i>The American government attempted to
contain the outbreak by detonating a bomb.</i>

45
00:04:31,128 --> 00:04:32,886
<i>It devastated Raccoon City.</i>

46
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:35,831
<i>But it couldn't stop
the airborne infection.</i>

47
00:04:35,862 --> 00:04:39,146
<i>The viral outbreak spread
across the world within days.</i>

48
00:04:39,814 --> 00:04:42,219
<i>Humankind was
brought to its knees.</i>

49
00:04:43,125 --> 00:04:45,844
<i>Finally, the last and
best hope of humanity,</i>

50
00:04:46,362 --> 00:04:49,688
<i>gathered and took a last
stand in Washington DC.</i>

51
00:04:49,991 --> 00:04:52,645
<i>But we didn't realize that
what we had walked into...</i>

52
00:04:53,148 --> 00:04:57,187
Was a trap. My name is Alice.
And this is my story.

53
00:04:57,788 --> 00:04:59,924
The end... of my story.

54
00:05:08,922 --> 00:05:13,256
Preveo: Bambula
Translator: Imdepresd

55
00:07:32,045 --> 00:07:33,745
Come on!

56
00:11:11,514 --> 00:11:13,214
Hello?

57
00:11:25,910 --> 00:11:27,760
Is there anyone alive in here?

58
00:11:38,116 --> 00:11:39,816
Hello?

59
00:12:51,328 --> 00:12:53,818
- You come here to gloat?
- My satellites show

60
00:12:53,853 --> 00:12:58,547
there are 4,472 humans remaining
on the surface of the Earth.

61
00:12:58,699 --> 00:13:02,089
They will cease to exist
in under 48 hours.

62
00:13:02,550 --> 00:13:04,250
What do you want from me?

63
00:13:04,379 --> 00:13:06,079
Want me to say
that you've won?

64
00:13:06,437 --> 00:13:09,235
- You've wiped out humanity.
- No. Quite the opposite.

65
00:13:09,413 --> 00:13:13,722
I want you to stop me.

66
00:13:14,553 --> 00:13:16,253
Behind you.

67
00:13:27,842 --> 00:13:30,540
- Nicely done.
- I don't trust you.

68
00:13:30,575 --> 00:13:33,597
Given our history, I'd
be surprised if you did.

69
00:13:33,632 --> 00:13:36,621
But unless you intervene,
the slaughter will be complete.

70
00:13:36,656 --> 00:13:40,015
- There will be no survivors.
- How can I possibly help them?

71
00:13:40,050 --> 00:13:43,374
Umbrella developed an
airborne antivirus.

72
00:13:44,851 --> 00:13:50,339
If released, it would destroy the T-Virus
and anything it has infected on contact.

73
00:13:50,776 --> 00:13:53,428
- All this could end?
- Precisely.

74
00:13:53,544 --> 00:13:54,942
Where is this antivirus?

75
00:13:55,142 --> 00:13:58,230
Beneath the streets of
Raccoon City, in the Hive.

76
00:13:58,428 --> 00:14:01,700
- Why would you help me?
- My programming will not allow me to harm

77
00:14:01,705 --> 00:14:03,461
the Umbrella Corporation.

78
00:14:03,661 --> 00:14:06,541
But you are bound by
no such constraints.

79
00:14:06,576 --> 00:14:11,038
You'd turn against Umbrella?
Against the people who created you? Why?

80
00:14:11,267 --> 00:14:15,722
Get to Raccoon City in 48 hours.
Make it to the Hive.

81
00:14:15,806 --> 00:14:17,942
And then you'll have your answer.

82
00:14:18,123 --> 00:14:20,329
I have no reason to
believe a word you say.

83
00:14:20,364 --> 00:14:24,161
True. But I can offer you
something you want very much.

84
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:27,897
- What is that?
- Revenge. Wesker.

85
00:14:28,038 --> 00:14:32,980
He led you all here to Washington.
He pretended to give you your powers back.

86
00:14:33,015 --> 00:14:35,690
And then,
he betrayed you.

87
00:14:36,198 --> 00:14:37,905
Where is he?

88
00:14:37,906 --> 00:14:41,690
He just landed at the Hive.
I'm resetting your watch.

89
00:14:44,426 --> 00:14:46,126
The clock is ticking.

90
00:14:49,115 --> 00:14:50,815
Alice.

91
00:14:51,414 --> 00:14:54,256
Ten years ago in the
Hive, we both failed.

92
00:14:54,837 --> 00:14:56,537
We let this happen.

93
00:14:57,441 --> 00:14:59,141
Make it right.

94
00:17:18,216 --> 00:17:19,916
Is that all you got?

95
00:18:16,682 --> 00:18:18,382
Alice.

96
00:18:22,366 --> 00:18:25,512
10 years ago in the Hive...
There will be no survivors...

97
00:18:40,427 --> 00:18:42,127
What is this place?

98
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,489
Where am I?
Answer me!

99
00:18:46,209 --> 00:18:49,804
- What's wrong with you? Who did this?
- Be quiet. Quiet!

100
00:18:49,913 --> 00:18:51,613
I told you...

101
00:18:59,460 --> 00:19:01,160
Silence.

102
00:19:08,065 --> 00:19:10,368
So you're awake at last.

103
00:19:10,556 --> 00:19:14,438
- I killed you.
- Yet here I am.

104
00:19:14,516 --> 00:19:16,216
A clone...

105
00:19:16,293 --> 00:19:20,431
- I killed your clone.
- You've been most troublesome to me.

106
00:19:20,466 --> 00:19:23,277
You and your sisters.

107
00:19:28,085 --> 00:19:29,971
And now I have you.

108
00:19:32,667 --> 00:19:35,623
The cleansing operation should've
finished over a year ago,

109
00:19:35,628 --> 00:19:37,328
but you slowed us down.

110
00:19:37,573 --> 00:19:40,995
So much so, that I was obliged
to take command myself.

111
00:19:41,030 --> 00:19:43,333
You could end all of this.

112
00:19:43,649 --> 00:19:45,510
Why don't you?

113
00:19:45,545 --> 00:19:47,245
Interesting.

114
00:19:49,501 --> 00:19:52,157
Someone told you
something, didn't they?

115
00:19:55,361 --> 00:19:59,513
Oh, well, you'll be begging
to tell me soon enough.

116
00:20:01,269 --> 00:20:03,059
She's an unbeliever.

117
00:20:03,733 --> 00:20:06,569
What do we do with unbelievers?

118
00:20:07,156 --> 00:20:09,581
Cast her out!

119
00:20:09,609 --> 00:20:14,700
Cast her out!
Cast her out!

120
00:20:14,887 --> 00:20:20,006
- Come on!
- Cast her out!

121
00:20:20,438 --> 00:20:24,871
Cast her out!

122
00:21:10,992 --> 00:21:14,151
God created a flood
to cleanse the Earth.

123
00:21:15,160 --> 00:21:19,467
40 days and 40 nights of rain.
Our method is taking a little longer,

124
00:21:19,502 --> 00:21:21,376
but the result will be the same.

125
00:21:21,566 --> 00:21:25,688
A world ready for the righteous
and the pure to inherit.

126
00:21:29,741 --> 00:21:33,740
We reach Raccoon City
in just over 12 hours.

127
00:21:35,980 --> 00:21:38,871
I doubt even you can
run for that long.

128
00:21:39,288 --> 00:21:41,728
I want to know what you know.

129
00:21:43,182 --> 00:21:45,386
Tell me when she's ready to talk.

130
00:21:55,148 --> 00:21:57,705
- Wesker.
- Dr. Isaacs.

131
00:21:58,744 --> 00:22:01,294
Look what I found on the roadside.

132
00:22:03,305 --> 00:22:07,371
It would appear your mission to Washington
was less successful than you made out.

133
00:22:07,406 --> 00:22:07,957
Impossible.

134
00:22:08,157 --> 00:22:10,611
I hope you didn't leave
any other loose ends.

135
00:22:11,570 --> 00:22:17,230
There's something else. I think she
knows about the airborne antivirus.

136
00:22:17,265 --> 00:22:20,589
- How can that be?
- I don't know. Yet.

137
00:22:20,665 --> 00:22:22,914
But we caught her on the
road to Raccoon City.

138
00:22:23,114 --> 00:22:24,913
Why else would she
be headed there?

139
00:22:25,548 --> 00:22:28,340
Raise the security level
at the Hive to maximum.

140
00:22:28,375 --> 00:22:31,690
No one in or out. I'll let
you know when she talks.

141
00:22:31,853 --> 00:22:33,628
God go with you.

142
00:22:35,512 --> 00:22:38,484
You heard him. Security level to maximum.

143
00:22:38,684 --> 00:22:39,844
As you wish.

144
00:23:05,449 --> 00:23:07,911
Get up there and check it out.

145
00:24:26,526 --> 00:24:28,226
Release me!

146
00:24:29,259 --> 00:24:31,107
- Open them.
- Alright.

147
00:24:31,142 --> 00:24:32,977
Alright.

148
00:25:12,408 --> 00:25:15,690
You can't use it.
You can't escape!

149
00:25:28,841 --> 00:25:30,541
Fire at her!

150
00:26:35,458 --> 00:26:37,632
Jesus!

151
00:26:43,882 --> 00:26:46,061
Sir.

152
00:26:46,607 --> 00:26:48,307
She's gone.

153
00:27:08,818 --> 00:27:11,777
Target is 72 miles and closing.

154
00:27:11,827 --> 00:27:15,201
Lock down the Hive.
Prepare defensive measures.

155
00:27:15,547 --> 00:27:17,972
And alert our operative
in Raccoon City.

156
00:27:50,639 --> 00:27:52,660
Welcome home.

157
00:28:28,338 --> 00:28:30,510
Airborne antivirus...

158
00:28:30,898 --> 00:28:32,939
48 hours...

159
00:28:32,959 --> 00:28:35,611
Make it to the Hive.

160
00:28:44,147 --> 00:28:46,202
Let him go!
Let him go now!

161
00:28:46,299 --> 00:28:48,143
Put it down or we'll shoot!

162
00:28:48,815 --> 00:28:50,696
I told you, Doc!
I told you you were wrong!

163
00:28:50,896 --> 00:28:52,061
Calm down, Christian!

164
00:28:52,062 --> 00:28:52,504
Calm down!

165
00:28:52,704 --> 00:28:54,961
We should've killed her
when we had the chance!

166
00:28:54,996 --> 00:28:57,592
Put it down, please.
Before he tries to shoot the both of us.

167
00:28:57,792 --> 00:28:58,657
What's in this?

168
00:28:58,658 --> 00:29:01,672
- Pure adrenaline. I needed you awake.
- Why?

169
00:29:01,707 --> 00:29:04,684
There's something coming. In the same
direction you came in. Something big.

170
00:29:04,696 --> 00:29:07,743
Let him go!
Put it down, now!

171
00:29:09,944 --> 00:29:11,644
Alice.

172
00:29:18,376 --> 00:29:20,448
Umbrella captured me at the Arcadia.

173
00:29:20,677 --> 00:29:22,689
We were headed somewhere
called the Hive.

174
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:25,368
Got loose, killed the pilot.
Crashed here.

175
00:29:25,817 --> 00:29:28,073
Doc and the others
pulled me from the crash.

176
00:29:28,443 --> 00:29:31,678
- I owe them my life.
- Doc!

177
00:29:31,755 --> 00:29:33,455
There, to the east.

178
00:29:33,959 --> 00:29:35,780
It's still headed our way.

179
00:29:36,899 --> 00:29:38,599
You know what it is?

180
00:29:39,273 --> 00:29:41,677
Umbrella. Doctor Isaacs.

181
00:29:41,712 --> 00:29:43,716
I thought that you killed him.

182
00:29:43,813 --> 00:29:45,544
I thought so, too.

183
00:29:45,838 --> 00:29:49,033
He has an army of undead with
him. He'll be here within hours.

184
00:29:49,081 --> 00:29:51,812
- What do we do?
- Why the hell are we asking her?

185
00:29:52,304 --> 00:29:54,351
She's a stranger.
We should have...

186
00:29:54,473 --> 00:29:57,387
- Hey, hey!
- Don't you touch me, Doc!

187
00:29:57,395 --> 00:30:00,464
- Put it down! Christian!
- You put it down!

188
00:30:00,552 --> 00:30:04,237
Look at me. Just cause you think you
should be in charge, doesn't make it so.

189
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:13,384
You listen to me, Doc.
You're gonna regret it. All of you!

190
00:30:14,462 --> 00:30:16,162
All of you!

191
00:30:26,411 --> 00:30:28,479
I have to get to the Hive.

192
00:30:29,146 --> 00:30:33,319
- You have to get these people out of here.
- We have children. Injured. The elderly.

193
00:30:33,648 --> 00:30:35,365
Now what chance do they
have on the open road?

194
00:30:35,565 --> 00:30:36,786
Better than they have here.

195
00:30:36,788 --> 00:30:40,072
- This building is secure.
- Maybe from the undead.

196
00:30:40,180 --> 00:30:44,586
But Isaacs has armored vehicles.
Rocket launchers, heavy ordinance.

197
00:30:44,671 --> 00:30:47,067
They're gonna tear
this place wide open.

198
00:30:49,519 --> 00:30:51,950
Doc!

199
00:31:00,233 --> 00:31:01,933
So what happened to her?

200
00:31:02,004 --> 00:31:04,677
She's set off one of the
traps we had on perimeter.

201
00:31:04,912 --> 00:31:06,612
Not intended for the undead.

202
00:31:09,894 --> 00:31:12,450
- What is this?
- Specialty of the house.

203
00:31:12,485 --> 00:31:16,025
- Have you in your feet in no time.
- Why should I trust you?

204
00:31:21,262 --> 00:31:22,962
Here.

205
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:30,032
Doc, you need to get out there.

206
00:31:30,232 --> 00:31:32,429
People are scared and
Christian's not helping.

207
00:31:33,433 --> 00:31:36,028
We need to let people
know what's happening.

208
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:36,832
Okay.

209
00:31:38,147 --> 00:31:39,847
I've got to go.

210
00:31:42,225 --> 00:31:43,925
Hey. Your friend's
gonna be okay.

211
00:31:44,732 --> 00:31:46,432
Thank you.

212
00:31:51,751 --> 00:31:54,368
- You know, he and I...
- I noticed.

213
00:31:54,795 --> 00:31:56,495
So what's in the Hive?

214
00:31:56,930 --> 00:31:58,630
Umbrella developed a cure.

215
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:01,739
An airborne antivirus.

216
00:32:01,978 --> 00:32:05,353
It'll destroy anything infected
with the T-Virus on contact.

217
00:32:05,655 --> 00:32:09,096
- Who told you this? And you believed her?
- The Red Queen.

218
00:32:10,134 --> 00:32:11,834
What if we could end all this?

219
00:32:12,006 --> 00:32:15,009
What about you? They
infected you with the T-Virus.

220
00:32:16,117 --> 00:32:18,322
You release this antivirus,
it's going to kill you.

221
00:32:18,337 --> 00:32:20,657
- Whatever it takes.
- Alice, I'm not...

222
00:32:20,692 --> 00:32:22,817
You know I'm right.

223
00:32:26,011 --> 00:32:27,711
All right.

224
00:32:29,187 --> 00:32:31,024
We stop Isaacs here.

225
00:32:31,526 --> 00:32:33,226
We save these people,

226
00:32:33,465 --> 00:32:35,165
and then we go together.

227
00:32:37,007 --> 00:32:39,076
We don't have long.

228
00:32:40,819 --> 00:32:42,519
Let's get to it.

229
00:32:56,936 --> 00:32:58,735
What else do you
have for defense?

230
00:32:58,769 --> 00:33:01,877
Not too many firearms, we
have a big supply of gasoline.

231
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:04,179
Here.
You need a weapon.

232
00:33:04,518 --> 00:33:06,891
- We're giving her a gun now?
- Take it easy, Christian.

233
00:33:07,126 --> 00:33:10,337
You can let your guard down if
you want, man. I don't intend to.

234
00:33:13,978 --> 00:33:16,641
When I rode in here,
someone was watching me.

235
00:33:16,676 --> 00:33:19,860
They could've called out or fired a shot
to warn me about the trap but they didn't.

236
00:33:20,554 --> 00:33:24,406
- What are you saying?
- Watch your back.

237
00:33:35,370 --> 00:33:39,025
So Dr. Isaacs, it seems you
let her slip through

238
00:33:39,026 --> 00:33:40,812
your fingers. Or what
remains of them.

239
00:33:40,854 --> 00:33:44,063
Don't forget who you're
talking to. Where is she?

240
00:33:44,098 --> 00:33:49,007
A settlement in Raccoon City. Our informant
reports that she's preparing for a fight.

241
00:33:49,008 --> 00:33:51,991
Good.
I'll be there in the hour.

242
00:34:17,468 --> 00:34:19,463
That's it.
Keep moving.

243
00:34:20,495 --> 00:34:24,176
We need all the gasoline
cans over there.

244
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:30,455
- Claire said you built this.
- That's right.

245
00:34:31,591 --> 00:34:33,845
This used to be
a window washer.

246
00:34:34,743 --> 00:34:37,681
- I made a couple of changes.
- Where did you learn to do that?

247
00:34:37,766 --> 00:34:41,210
My father used to run
a chop shop. I hated it.

248
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,253
Who knew?
I guess I was paying attention after all.

249
00:34:44,453 --> 00:34:45,054
Good.

250
00:34:45,089 --> 00:34:48,673
Because I'm gonna need you to make
a few more changes to this thing.

251
00:35:10,982 --> 00:35:16,312
Ready the weapons. High
explosive rounds. No survivors.

252
00:35:28,824 --> 00:35:34,381
He's here. They're coming!
Close the gates!

253
00:35:51,654 --> 00:35:55,661
My God.
It's an army.

254
00:36:00,457 --> 00:36:03,245
- What are we gonna do?
- Yeah.

255
00:36:03,420 --> 00:36:08,479
- What are we gonna do?
- We're gonna kill every last one of them.

256
00:36:19,732 --> 00:36:21,668
Prepare to fire!

257
00:36:34,486 --> 00:36:36,186
Get ready!

258
00:36:38,152 --> 00:36:39,852
Light it up!

259
00:36:50,753 --> 00:36:53,371
Fire!

260
00:37:06,435 --> 00:37:09,457
- Damn her!
- Reload.

261
00:37:10,874 --> 00:37:13,612
Close it up.
Full stop.

262
00:37:15,188 --> 00:37:16,888
Release the bait.

263
00:37:21,668 --> 00:37:25,196
- There's a survivor. Open the gate.
- Open the gate!

264
00:37:26,236 --> 00:37:29,938
Open fire! Keep
them off her.

265
00:37:32,863 --> 00:37:34,790
Marker 2!

266
00:37:38,114 --> 00:37:40,410
Fire!

267
00:37:49,721 --> 00:37:52,644
Claire, Doc, get out
there. Bring her in.

268
00:37:58,911 --> 00:38:00,611
Come on!

269
00:38:01,141 --> 00:38:02,841
Wait.

270
00:38:03,643 --> 00:38:06,048
She's almost there.

271
00:38:06,650 --> 00:38:08,422
Fire.

272
00:38:09,893 --> 00:38:13,135
Damn you. Close
the gate now!

273
00:38:23,121 --> 00:38:25,502
Claire, they've breached the gate.

274
00:38:31,537 --> 00:38:33,237
Claire!

275
00:38:41,493 --> 00:38:43,653
Fire.

276
00:38:50,318 --> 00:38:55,025
- Razor, now!
- Right! You heard her. Push!

277
00:39:03,462 --> 00:39:05,162
Move!

278
00:39:15,069 --> 00:39:17,125
Abandon the gate. Pull
back to the barricades.

279
00:39:17,160 --> 00:39:21,329
Looks like she's out of
tricks. Target the roof.

280
00:39:23,272 --> 00:39:25,366
Everybody get down!

281
00:39:26,587 --> 00:39:28,287
Now!

282
00:39:53,715 --> 00:39:57,104
- Alice! We're at the barricades.
- Claire, you have to hold him there.

283
00:40:30,696 --> 00:40:32,396
Doc!

284
00:40:53,949 --> 00:40:56,076
Alice! We can't hold
on much longer.

285
00:40:56,111 --> 00:40:58,661
Get out of there, now.

286
00:41:38,289 --> 00:41:41,432
Back up.
Now!

287
00:42:02,172 --> 00:42:05,312
Bring all guns to bear.

288
00:42:08,666 --> 00:42:10,661
Fire.

289
00:42:13,885 --> 00:42:15,841
Where is she?

290
00:42:16,830 --> 00:42:18,684
Where have she gone?

291
00:42:20,523 --> 00:42:22,695
Find her.

292
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:31,476
Close the vents! Now!

293
00:42:44,322 --> 00:42:46,395
Don't shoot!

294
00:43:36,125 --> 00:43:39,454
You're fast, but
you're not too smart.

295
00:44:13,682 --> 00:44:15,677
- Don't shoot, please.
- Where is he?

296
00:44:15,802 --> 00:44:17,973
That way.

297
00:44:28,913 --> 00:44:29,660
Save your ammo.

298
00:44:29,860 --> 00:44:32,450
There's too many of these
things still out here.

299
00:44:32,824 --> 00:44:35,296
I'll take care of it.

300
00:44:36,869 --> 00:44:38,569
No.

301
00:44:39,585 --> 00:44:42,651
- Move out.
- Let's go!

302
00:44:43,512 --> 00:44:45,318
Enjoy the ride.

303
00:45:03,733 --> 00:45:06,572
Guys. There's something
here you gotta see.

304
00:45:06,772 --> 00:45:07,313
Go.

305
00:45:08,105 --> 00:45:11,419
Two more armies of undead.
Headed straight for us.

306
00:45:11,600 --> 00:45:13,612
There. On
the horizon.

307
00:45:15,782 --> 00:45:17,482
And a second over there.

308
00:45:19,977 --> 00:45:22,517
We're out of gasoline.
We're defenseless.

309
00:45:23,153 --> 00:45:26,328
I have to make it to the Hive.
It's our only chance now.

310
00:45:26,471 --> 00:45:28,360
- I'll come with you.
- Count me in.

311
00:45:28,560 --> 00:45:29,171
Me, too.

312
00:45:29,206 --> 00:45:33,541
And me. I was wrong
about you. Blow me.

313
00:45:41,157 --> 00:45:44,356
We know where you're
going. Into the pit.

314
00:45:45,526 --> 00:45:47,226
We want to come.

315
00:45:48,729 --> 00:45:50,429
Please.

316
00:45:51,216 --> 00:45:55,542
Grab some gear.
You're gonna need it.

317
00:46:14,962 --> 00:46:18,800
- What is it?
- The part of the Hive exposed by the blast.

318
00:46:19,012 --> 00:46:20,782
That's our way in.

319
00:46:39,197 --> 00:46:42,038
- Let's move!
- I'll take point.

320
00:47:05,136 --> 00:47:06,942
Activate security measures now.

321
00:47:07,073 --> 00:47:10,341
Hive security fully
activated and automated.

322
00:47:10,541 --> 00:47:11,149
No.

323
00:47:11,748 --> 00:47:15,730
Disengage automation.
I'll handle the defenses myself.

324
00:47:15,765 --> 00:47:19,755
Defenses will be more efficient
if I retain control of them.

325
00:47:20,445 --> 00:47:25,658
Really? I seem to remember last
time she was here she walked out alive.

326
00:47:26,053 --> 00:47:28,151
I don't intend to make
that same mistake.

327
00:47:28,161 --> 00:47:31,957
As you wish. Hive defenses
are now in your hands.

328
00:47:33,876 --> 00:47:39,194
- Unleash the Cerberus.
- Cerberus on play.

329
00:47:42,907 --> 00:47:48,355
Did you have someone? Before
all this? Husband? Family?

330
00:47:48,958 --> 00:47:51,632
- Can't remember.
- How is that possible?

331
00:47:51,634 --> 00:47:53,897
I woke up just when
all of this was starting.

332
00:47:54,341 --> 00:47:56,333
Can't recall much before that.

333
00:47:56,588 --> 00:47:58,792
Sometimes I feel like
this has been my whole life.

334
00:47:59,214 --> 00:48:03,061
Running. Killing.

335
00:48:14,619 --> 00:48:17,543
- What is it?
- Something's stalking us.

336
00:48:17,578 --> 00:48:21,757
- Are you sure?
- This is what I do.

337
00:48:34,743 --> 00:48:36,814
Run!

338
00:48:36,836 --> 00:48:38,640
Run, fast!

339
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:01,210
Come on!

340
00:50:17,555 --> 00:50:20,094
Is everyone okay?

341
00:50:23,289 --> 00:50:25,861
This way!

342
00:50:40,688 --> 00:50:42,388
Right behind us!

343
00:51:10,036 --> 00:51:11,736
Why'd they stop?

344
00:51:14,031 --> 00:51:16,169
- Maybe they're scared.
- Scared of what?

345
00:51:19,399 --> 00:51:21,099
Whatever's down there.

346
00:51:28,332 --> 00:51:30,118
Seal the Hive.

347
00:51:35,190 --> 00:51:36,890
Let's go!

348
00:51:45,572 --> 00:51:47,272
Alice!

349
00:52:20,503 --> 00:52:22,203
- You okay?
- Yeah.

350
00:52:22,632 --> 00:52:25,793
- My mag's half empty.
- Lost my guns at the lake.

351
00:52:25,817 --> 00:52:28,901
- I only got one round left.
- One spare mag and then I'm out.

352
00:52:28,927 --> 00:52:32,877
No guns, no ammo, what the
hell are we gonna do down here?

353
00:52:35,462 --> 00:52:39,278
- Alice. What's with the lights?
- There's a part of the Hive that's damaged.

354
00:52:40,087 --> 00:52:42,719
- Power's erratic.
- Here. Take this.

355
00:52:45,452 --> 00:52:47,152
Hey. Look.

356
00:52:56,267 --> 00:53:00,601
You asked why I'd turn against Umbrella.
And I promised you an answer.

357
00:53:00,636 --> 00:53:02,871
Soon after the
T-Virus was released,

358
00:53:02,872 --> 00:53:06,287
a secret file was uploaded
to my data stream.

359
00:53:06,322 --> 00:53:09,487
It was a recording of a meeting
of the Umbrella High Command.

360
00:53:09,593 --> 00:53:13,438
Dated 17 months before
the viral outbreak occurred.

361
00:53:13,926 --> 00:53:18,959
We're here today, not just to talk
about the future of this company.

362
00:53:19,431 --> 00:53:21,564
We're here to talk
about its destiny.

363
00:53:22,682 --> 00:53:25,063
We're here to talk about
the end of the world.

364
00:53:25,399 --> 00:53:30,634
We stand on the brink of Armageddon.
Diseases for which we have no cure.

365
00:53:31,304 --> 00:53:34,282
Fundamentalist states who
call for our destruction.

366
00:53:34,317 --> 00:53:36,958
Nuclear powers over
which we have no control.

367
00:53:37,580 --> 00:53:40,095
And even if we navigate
these dangerous waters,

368
00:53:40,130 --> 00:53:43,258
we face harder, even
more inevitable threats.

369
00:53:43,720 --> 00:53:47,400
Global warming will melt the
polar ice caps within 80 years,

370
00:53:47,435 --> 00:53:50,609
flooding 90% of all
habitable areas on Earth.

371
00:53:51,188 --> 00:53:54,056
Unchecked population
growth will overtake

372
00:53:54,091 --> 00:53:58,102
food production in less than
50 years leading to famine.

373
00:53:58,453 --> 00:54:01,271
And war. This is not
conjecture. This is a fact.

374
00:54:01,815 --> 00:54:05,606
One way or another, our
world is coming to an end.

375
00:54:07,167 --> 00:54:10,097
The question is, will
we end with it?

376
00:54:11,114 --> 00:54:12,878
What do you propose?

377
00:54:14,732 --> 00:54:17,590
I propose that we
end the world...

378
00:54:18,710 --> 00:54:20,507
But on our terms.

379
00:54:20,958 --> 00:54:23,355
An orchestrated apocalypse.

380
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:26,614
One that would cleanse
the world of its' population

381
00:54:26,619 --> 00:54:29,788
but leave its infrastructure
and resources intact.

382
00:54:30,762 --> 00:54:34,614
It's been done once before.
With great success.

383
00:54:36,078 --> 00:54:38,173
The chosen few will
ride out the storm,

384
00:54:38,525 --> 00:54:41,443
not in an ark as in the book
of Genesis, but in safety.

385
00:54:42,005 --> 00:54:45,174
Underground.
And when it's over,

386
00:54:45,542 --> 00:54:48,022
We will emerge onto
a cleansed Earth.

387
00:54:48,522 --> 00:54:52,275
One we can then reboot.
In our image.

388
00:54:52,626 --> 00:54:55,369
And just how do you
intend to achieve this?

389
00:54:56,016 --> 00:54:59,271
The means of our salvation
are already at hand.

390
00:54:59,725 --> 00:55:03,971
I give to you, the T-virus.

391
00:55:06,579 --> 00:55:08,469
They released it deliberately.

392
00:55:09,016 --> 00:55:11,703
When this recording was
uploaded to my data stream,

393
00:55:11,738 --> 00:55:14,240
it created a conflict
in my programming.

394
00:55:14,904 --> 00:55:17,508
I was created to serve
the Umbrella Corporation,

395
00:55:17,543 --> 00:55:20,918
but I was also programmed
to value human life.

396
00:55:20,953 --> 00:55:26,370
Dr. Isaacs allowed the virus to
escape. He murdered over 7 billion people.

397
00:55:27,386 --> 00:55:29,516
My programming will
not allow me to harm

398
00:55:29,716 --> 00:55:31,846
an employee of the
Umbrella Corporation.

399
00:55:31,881 --> 00:55:35,916
I am powerless to stop
Dr. Isaacs, but you are not.

400
00:55:35,951 --> 00:55:40,222
In 37 minutes, the last of the
human settlements will fall.

401
00:55:40,257 --> 00:55:42,081
There will be no survivors.

402
00:55:42,627 --> 00:55:46,274
It is imperative that you release
the antivirus before this occurs,

403
00:55:46,309 --> 00:55:48,212
or Umbrella will have won.

404
00:55:48,765 --> 00:55:53,020
There is one last thing. There is an
earpiece in front of you. Put it in.

405
00:55:58,601 --> 00:56:02,286
I cannot, in my actions, harm an
employee of the Umbrella Corporation.

406
00:56:02,880 --> 00:56:06,607
But I can tell you that Umbrella
had an informant in Raccoon City.

407
00:56:07,511 --> 00:56:10,686
It is highly likely that this
person is now here with you.

408
00:56:12,932 --> 00:56:16,301
Time is running out,
Alice. You have to hurry.

409
00:56:52,487 --> 00:56:54,387
I'm glad to see you, Dr. Isaacs.

410
00:56:54,448 --> 00:56:57,333
We didn't think there'd be any
survivors after that last attack.

411
00:56:57,378 --> 00:57:00,190
- Water.
- Yes, of course. Get Dr. Isaacs some water.

412
00:57:00,728 --> 00:57:03,548
- Then resume course for Raccoon City.
- She's not there.

413
00:57:04,574 --> 00:57:07,444
- What?
- She went to the pit. We have to follow.

414
00:57:07,670 --> 00:57:11,260
- Those are not my orders. I have strict...
- We have to go to the pit.

415
00:57:25,350 --> 00:57:27,050
Thank you.

416
00:57:43,342 --> 00:57:46,216
- What is this place?
- It's an air intake for the Hive.

417
00:57:46,624 --> 00:57:48,324
Come on!

418
00:57:48,711 --> 00:57:50,411
No. Really?

419
00:58:37,466 --> 00:58:39,415
All clear!

420
00:59:09,094 --> 00:59:11,511
Hurry up! The power's
coming back on!

421
00:59:11,546 --> 00:59:13,254
- Claire!
- Hurry! Let's go!

422
00:59:23,739 --> 00:59:25,439
Come on.

423
00:59:26,942 --> 00:59:28,642
Come on!

424
00:59:37,163 --> 00:59:38,863
Okay.

425
00:59:41,633 --> 00:59:43,333
- You all right?
- Yeah.

426
00:59:47,289 --> 00:59:48,989
Someone's watching us.

427
00:59:52,964 --> 00:59:55,044
Reverse polarity
of the turbine.

428
01:00:09,294 --> 01:00:11,194
The blades are going
the other way.

429
01:00:11,346 --> 01:00:14,866
We have to get out of here. The
blades are sucking the air backwards!

430
01:00:24,871 --> 01:00:26,571
Come on!

431
01:00:41,096 --> 01:00:42,796
Come on!

432
01:01:36,525 --> 01:01:38,423
No!

433
01:03:38,257 --> 01:03:39,957
This way.

434
01:03:42,056 --> 01:03:43,756
We have to hurry.

435
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:45,830
Wait!

436
01:04:07,238 --> 01:04:08,938
Let's go.

437
01:06:15,328 --> 01:06:17,028
Razor?

438
01:06:17,731 --> 01:06:19,431
Are you okay?

439
01:06:22,655 --> 01:06:24,369
Yeah.

440
01:06:24,370 --> 01:06:26,070
Let's go.

441
01:09:14,241 --> 01:09:16,643
- What the hell was that?
- Bio-weapon.

442
01:09:16,678 --> 01:09:20,036
- This one's human. No.
- Have you seen Claire?

443
01:09:20,867 --> 01:09:23,695
- Razor?
- He didn't make it.

444
01:09:25,842 --> 01:09:27,542
Come on.

445
01:09:27,709 --> 01:09:29,409
We have to hurry.

446
01:09:29,928 --> 01:09:32,862
If the target continues on
her present course,

447
01:09:32,897 --> 01:09:35,965
- she'll be here in under 7 minutes.
- Wake them.

448
01:09:36,602 --> 01:09:40,830
My instructions are to do so, only
in the greatest of emergencies.

449
01:09:41,886 --> 01:09:43,586
Wake them now!

450
01:10:53,118 --> 01:10:54,818
What is it?

451
01:11:09,024 --> 01:11:10,724
We have to
get out of here.

452
01:11:27,249 --> 01:11:29,605
Here. More stopping power.

453
01:11:37,971 --> 01:11:40,359
- Time's running out.
- Where to next?

454
01:11:44,001 --> 01:11:47,180
- The final level of the Hive's below us.
- How do we get down there?

455
01:11:52,070 --> 01:11:53,770
That's how.

456
01:12:10,835 --> 01:12:13,711
- What are they?
- Cryogenic storage.

457
01:12:15,571 --> 01:12:17,339
Must be thousands of them.

458
01:12:17,790 --> 01:12:19,567
The Umbrella High Command.

459
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,929
Waiting out the apocalypse in safety.

460
01:12:26,216 --> 01:12:30,272
A Noah's Ark for the
rich, and powerful.

461
01:12:34,044 --> 01:12:35,744
What are you doing?

462
01:12:37,792 --> 01:12:39,492
Give me a hand.

463
01:12:51,549 --> 01:12:53,249
Is it done?

464
01:12:53,496 --> 01:12:56,139
- The cleansing process is complete?
- No.

465
01:12:56,942 --> 01:12:59,693
- Then why am I awake?
- We had a problem.

466
01:13:00,397 --> 01:13:02,097
- I tried...
- Save your breath.

467
01:13:02,673 --> 01:13:04,373
I know exactly
what's happening.

468
01:13:07,507 --> 01:13:09,207
We've been betrayed.

469
01:13:19,433 --> 01:13:21,133
That's right!

470
01:13:21,937 --> 01:13:23,637
Over here!

471
01:13:25,704 --> 01:13:27,404
Come on. That's it!

472
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:29,939
Follow me!

473
01:14:31,662 --> 01:14:33,362
Let's go.

474
01:14:48,780 --> 01:14:50,750
The bad seed returns.

475
01:14:52,101 --> 01:14:55,821
Or is it the prodigal daughter?
Well, don't just stand there. Come in.

476
01:14:56,333 --> 01:15:00,307
After all, you have only 9
minutes to save the world.

477
01:15:02,282 --> 01:15:02,994
You're really him?

478
01:15:03,194 --> 01:15:06,278
First things first, I'm gonna need
you to place your weapons on the floor.

479
01:15:06,313 --> 01:15:09,994
- Why would I wanna do that?
- This is what you're after, yes?

480
01:15:11,163 --> 01:15:14,348
The Antivirus.
The cure to all this.

481
01:15:16,100 --> 01:15:17,846
Well, there's only one vial.

482
01:15:18,792 --> 01:15:21,461
We're half a mile underground
in a sealed facility.

483
01:15:21,496 --> 01:15:24,204
I drop it here, the
antivirus goes nowhere,

484
01:15:24,205 --> 01:15:28,425
and your hopeless dreams will
die sooner rather than later.

485
01:15:40,144 --> 01:15:41,844
Good girl.

486
01:15:45,792 --> 01:15:47,511
- You're still armed.
- Yes.

487
01:15:48,157 --> 01:15:51,528
- Claire would be so disappointed.
- In a few minutes,

488
01:15:51,563 --> 01:15:54,880
Claire will be dead. Along
with everybody else you know.

489
01:15:54,915 --> 01:15:57,540
That's sweet.

490
01:15:58,855 --> 01:16:01,368
Sorry. My love.

491
01:16:02,467 --> 01:16:05,835
Move away from the weapon.
And the detonator. Come on.

492
01:16:09,458 --> 01:16:12,724
She placed explosives in
the High Command cryo tubes.

493
01:16:12,730 --> 01:16:16,270
- Thank you.
- You've done well, Doc.

494
01:16:47,719 --> 01:16:50,282
Don't bother. You
don't make it.

495
01:16:50,416 --> 01:16:54,910
To the ice pick, the decanter
or the fountain pen.

496
01:17:23,551 --> 01:17:25,705
And, in answer to
your question, yes...

497
01:17:25,740 --> 01:17:28,001
apart from a few
technological upgrades,

498
01:17:28,036 --> 01:17:31,655
I'm Dr. Alexander Roland Isaacs.

499
01:17:32,281 --> 01:17:32,829
The original.

500
01:17:33,029 --> 01:17:35,685
The one I met out there,
he thought exactly the same thing.

501
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,990
Of course he did. That's
how they're designed.

502
01:17:38,025 --> 01:17:41,309
They always try harder and
fight longer even to death

503
01:17:41,344 --> 01:17:43,833
as long as they think
they're the real thing.

504
01:17:44,322 --> 01:17:48,274
After all, who wants to know they're
just a poor imitation, or a worthless copy?

505
01:17:49,961 --> 01:17:51,661
Which brings us to you.

506
01:17:52,480 --> 01:17:54,180
- No.
- Oh come now.

507
01:17:55,600 --> 01:17:57,920
You thought you were the original.

508
01:18:00,574 --> 01:18:02,274
How delicious.

509
01:18:03,908 --> 01:18:07,066
No, I'm afraid she holds
that dubious honor.

510
01:18:07,527 --> 01:18:11,256
Alicia Marcus, daughter
of my old partner, James.

511
01:18:11,291 --> 01:18:15,350
Co-owner of the Umbrella Corporation
and a painful thorn in my side.

512
01:18:15,701 --> 01:18:20,742
- What I now intend to remove.
- Time, is running out, Alice.

513
01:18:21,289 --> 01:18:25,821
- You must kill him soon.
- It's good to see you too, Alicia.

514
01:18:26,747 --> 01:18:30,883
Marcus created the T-Virus to
save her but the effects didn't last.

515
01:18:30,918 --> 01:18:34,045
I've been waiting
years for her to die.

516
01:18:35,252 --> 01:18:36,952
I'm not...

517
01:18:36,957 --> 01:18:38,746
- I'm not a clone.
- Really?

518
01:18:40,273 --> 01:18:43,038
You must've wondered why you
remember nothing of your childhood.

519
01:18:43,430 --> 01:18:46,716
Your father. Your mother.

520
01:18:47,790 --> 01:18:48,700
Memory loss.

521
01:18:48,900 --> 01:18:52,768
No. You have no memory
because you had no life.

522
01:18:53,298 --> 01:18:57,025
Nothing before the mansion,
when we created you, 10 years ago.

523
01:18:57,060 --> 01:18:59,688
- I know who I am.
- I don't think so.

524
01:19:00,773 --> 01:19:03,630
You're nothing more than a
puppet whose strings were cut.

525
01:19:04,096 --> 01:19:05,192
And then you wandered around

526
01:19:05,392 --> 01:19:07,271
for a little while thinking
you were a real girl.

527
01:19:07,306 --> 01:19:10,134
But you're not. You're
just a clever imitation.

528
01:19:10,924 --> 01:19:12,624
A facsimile.

529
01:19:12,865 --> 01:19:14,690
A rather troublesome one at that.

530
01:19:15,741 --> 01:19:17,441
You're lying to me.

531
01:19:17,663 --> 01:19:19,591
I'm afraid he's not.

532
01:19:19,626 --> 01:19:22,492
You were created in
her image, as was I.

533
01:19:22,527 --> 01:19:26,940
My likeness and voice were based
on childhood recordings of Alicia Marcus,

534
01:19:26,975 --> 01:19:28,804
made by her father.

535
01:19:29,729 --> 01:19:32,631
Your genetic structure
is based on her DNA,

536
01:19:33,215 --> 01:19:36,123
tweaked to avoid the progeria
aging disease that afflicted her.

537
01:19:36,124 --> 01:19:37,895
I'm the child she was.

538
01:19:37,954 --> 01:19:41,710
You are the woman
she would've been.

539
01:19:42,308 --> 01:19:47,689
No. You are so much better
than I ever could be.

540
01:19:48,313 --> 01:19:50,013
I let this happen.

541
01:19:50,479 --> 01:19:52,179
I was weak.

542
01:19:52,718 --> 01:19:57,083
- You cannot afford to be.
- Time is running out, Alice.

543
01:19:57,547 --> 01:19:59,298
Ah, how touching.

544
01:19:59,299 --> 01:20:03,326
The trinity of bitches,
united in their hatred.

545
01:20:04,182 --> 01:20:05,955
Not that it'll do
you any good.

546
01:20:05,956 --> 01:20:07,906
I've been ahead of you
every step of the way.

547
01:20:07,907 --> 01:20:10,446
You've changed nothing.
You've saved no one.

548
01:20:10,969 --> 01:20:14,692
The world will still be cleansed and
the Umbrella Corporation will triumph.

549
01:20:14,911 --> 01:20:17,466
The only difference is, I'll
no longer have to

550
01:20:17,501 --> 01:20:19,458
listen to your self-
righteous whining.

551
01:20:19,493 --> 01:20:22,443
When you uploaded that file
to the Red Queen's data stream,

552
01:20:22,478 --> 01:20:24,244
you turned against
the Corporation.

553
01:20:24,279 --> 01:20:27,032
When the rest of the board
awake, you'll be replaced.

554
01:20:27,067 --> 01:20:33,384
- And I will assume complete control.
- I still own 50% of this company.

555
01:20:34,009 --> 01:20:39,679
- And what do you intend to do with that?
- You are co-owner of this corporation.

556
01:20:40,107 --> 01:20:43,865
But Wesker? Wesker
is still an employee.

557
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:47,257
I don't have to take your orders.
My loyalties are with him.

558
01:20:47,292 --> 01:20:49,005
I know.

559
01:20:49,736 --> 01:20:53,578
Albert Wesker, you're fired.

560
01:21:17,039 --> 01:21:18,739
How did you
know it was me?

561
01:21:19,027 --> 01:21:20,727
You're still alive.

562
01:21:22,856 --> 01:21:25,281
Please. It wasn't
like I had a choice.

563
01:21:26,358 --> 01:21:28,372
- They made me do it.
- Don't worry.

564
01:21:28,749 --> 01:21:30,449
I'm not gonna kill you.

565
01:21:34,992 --> 01:21:37,829
- Claire, it's me.
- Sorry.

566
01:21:39,407 --> 01:21:41,107
- Please.
- My love.

567
01:21:42,043 --> 01:21:43,743
No!

568
01:21:44,851 --> 01:21:49,427
If you keep this trigger depressed,
you keep Umbrella's dreams alive.

569
01:21:49,905 --> 01:21:51,924
I should have killed
you in Washington.

570
01:21:53,512 --> 01:21:55,212
Yeah.

571
01:21:56,917 --> 01:21:59,624
He only has to evade you
for another few minutes.

572
01:22:00,686 --> 01:22:04,007
And the last remaining
human outposts will fall.

573
01:22:05,596 --> 01:22:08,741
We need an intercept path. And
the fastest way to the surface.

574
01:22:09,815 --> 01:22:11,515
Already done.

575
01:22:11,985 --> 01:22:18,985
If you release the Antivirus, it will kill
all organisms infected with the T-Virus.

576
01:22:20,755 --> 01:22:23,351
You know what that
means, don't you?

577
01:22:24,399 --> 01:22:27,800
- I know.
- Alice. You can't!

578
01:22:28,296 --> 01:22:30,986
- I don't have a choice.
- There has to be another way.

579
01:22:34,438 --> 01:22:36,157
You know there isn't.

580
01:22:36,357 --> 01:22:39,057
4:33 left.
You have to hurry!

581
01:23:24,359 --> 01:23:26,059
Help me.

582
01:23:26,341 --> 01:23:28,075
You don't need help, Wesker.

583
01:23:31,066 --> 01:23:32,766
You're dying.

584
01:23:33,759 --> 01:23:35,459
Just get on with it.

585
01:23:38,034 --> 01:23:40,730
This is Dr. Alexander Roland Isaacs.

586
01:23:41,696 --> 01:23:44,749
Confirm DNA scan and
voice print identification.

587
01:23:44,784 --> 01:23:49,606
- Identity confirmed.
- Confirm security override 4365.

588
01:23:49,796 --> 01:23:51,550
Override confirmed.

589
01:23:51,551 --> 01:23:55,905
You will now take yourself offline and
place all functions under my sole control.

590
01:23:55,940 --> 01:23:58,330
As you wish.
Shutting down now.

591
01:23:59,160 --> 01:24:02,873
Dr. Isaacs.
You and the Umbrella High Command.

592
01:24:03,073 --> 01:24:03,815
Yes?

593
01:24:04,611 --> 01:24:07,188
You're all going to die down here.

594
01:24:11,841 --> 01:24:14,428
Your little friend won't
be able to help you now.

595
01:24:14,463 --> 01:24:16,305
You can't run anymore.

596
01:24:19,430 --> 01:24:21,130
I wasn't running.

597
01:28:07,780 --> 01:28:09,480
Is that all you got?

598
01:28:11,188 --> 01:28:12,888
Because if it is...

599
01:28:13,894 --> 01:28:15,594
I'm gonna have to kill you.

600
01:29:03,617 --> 01:29:05,947
We've played a long
game, you and I.

601
01:29:08,050 --> 01:29:09,750
But now it's over.

602
01:29:10,563 --> 01:29:12,685
Yes.

603
01:29:14,093 --> 01:29:15,793
Yes, it is.

604
01:30:08,697 --> 01:30:10,397
I made you.

605
01:30:10,745 --> 01:30:12,445
Yeah.

606
01:30:13,036 --> 01:30:14,736
Big mistake.

607
01:30:21,958 --> 01:30:23,658
Claire.

608
01:30:25,014 --> 01:30:26,789
Go. While there's still time.

609
01:30:27,599 --> 01:30:29,381
Go! I'll be right behind you.

610
01:31:30,356 --> 01:31:32,056
Your time's up.

611
01:31:35,458 --> 01:31:37,158
Alice!

612
01:31:37,302 --> 01:31:39,765
I brought them here!
I brought them for you!

613
01:31:48,392 --> 01:31:50,242
What the hell are you?

614
01:31:52,817 --> 01:31:54,538
I'm you, you idiot.

615
01:31:58,613 --> 01:32:00,313
No.

616
01:32:01,057 --> 01:32:02,757
No.

617
01:32:03,631 --> 01:32:05,331
That's not possible.

618
01:32:05,695 --> 01:32:07,395
The real you.

619
01:32:08,775 --> 01:32:10,475
No!

620
01:32:13,015 --> 01:32:15,027
Liar! Abomination!

621
01:32:15,213 --> 01:32:17,538
Filthy,

622
01:32:17,911 --> 01:32:19,664
clone!

623
01:32:29,729 --> 01:32:31,781
I'm me. He's not me.

624
01:34:19,283 --> 01:34:20,983
You did it. Alice.

625
01:34:21,483 --> 01:34:23,183
Alice?

626
01:34:24,887 --> 01:34:26,587
You did it.

627
01:34:29,581 --> 01:34:31,281
Why am I still alive?

628
01:34:31,746 --> 01:34:33,446
I don't know.

629
01:34:38,484 --> 01:34:40,203
- What happened?
- When Isaacs died,

630
01:34:40,204 --> 01:34:43,133
I could bring myself back
online and stop the attacks

631
01:34:43,168 --> 01:34:44,981
on the remaining
human settlements.

632
01:34:45,525 --> 01:34:48,252
- You saved them.
- Why am I still alive?

633
01:34:48,287 --> 01:34:51,931
The Antivirus only destroyed
the T-Virus within your body.

634
01:34:51,966 --> 01:34:56,208
It didn't harm the healthy cells.
You are now free of infection.

635
01:34:57,207 --> 01:35:00,419
I thought I would die.
You and Alicia...

636
01:35:00,430 --> 01:35:01,105
You lied to me.

637
01:35:01,305 --> 01:35:04,051
We had to know if you were
willing to make the sacrifice,

638
01:35:04,086 --> 01:35:08,975
to give up your life for others. This was
something no one at Umbrella would've done.

639
01:35:09,010 --> 01:35:13,498
Alicia Marcus was right about you.
You were better than all of them.

640
01:35:13,533 --> 01:35:16,110
I was one of them. I
was created by Umbrella.

641
01:35:16,778 --> 01:35:18,926
- Just an instrument for them.
- No.

642
01:35:18,961 --> 01:35:22,608
You became something more than
they could ever have anticipated.

643
01:35:22,643 --> 01:35:26,135
The clone became more
human than they ever could be.

644
01:35:27,219 --> 01:35:29,624
And you have one
more step to make.

645
01:35:31,790 --> 01:35:33,490
What do you mean?

646
01:35:38,836 --> 01:35:41,984
Before she died, Alicia
downloaded her memories,

647
01:35:42,433 --> 01:35:44,162
for you.

648
01:35:44,163 --> 01:35:46,066
The childhood you never had.

649
01:35:50,322 --> 01:35:53,076
Combined with the woman
she could never become.

650
01:36:25,899 --> 01:36:27,931
When the T-Virus
spread across the Earth,

651
01:36:27,966 --> 01:36:30,235
it did so at the speed
of the modern world.

652
01:36:30,270 --> 01:36:32,719
Carried by jetliners
across the globe.

653
01:36:34,342 --> 01:36:37,168
The antivirus is airborne,
spread by the winds.

654
01:36:38,123 --> 01:36:41,262
It could take years for it to
reach every corner of the Earth.

655
01:36:42,141 --> 01:36:44,379
Until then, my
work is not done.

656
01:36:51,298 --> 01:36:53,311
My name is Alice.

657
