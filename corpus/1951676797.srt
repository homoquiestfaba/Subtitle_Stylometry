3
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:18,960
There is this theory.

4
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,960
Given an infinite univers
and infinite time...

5
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:22,960
all things will happen.

6
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:24,960
That means that every event is inevitable

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,960
including those that are impossible.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:31,800
that's as good explenation
for all this as anything else.

9
00:00:31,839 --> 00:00:34,960
Now, a lot of stories start in bars,
so that's where we are going to stars this one.

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,960
Not because that I was there.
I wasn't.

11
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,960
But because it is a dam good
introduction to a vary unique...

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:42,960
fella.

13
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,960
Legends of every major culture,
all contain some sort of character

14
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:47,960
whose purpose is to grand wishes.

15
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:48,960
except Americas.

16
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,960
The Arabs have Jinni's...
The Irish have Leprechauns...

17
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:54,960
The Chinese have dragons and monkeys...
The Europeans have ferries and wood sprits.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,600
What do we have?

19
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:00,960
Santa Clause?

20
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:02,960
Santa Clause just brings presents,
he doesn't grand wishes.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,959
See he grants wishes.

22
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,959
Zak, saints predate American culture,
he doesn't grand wishes, he makes deals.

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:09,959
All right, I give up.

24
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,959
- What do we have here?
- No one.

25
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:13,959
That's my theses.

26
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:16,959
Our culture is unique in having no such mythology.

27
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:18,959
Oh you're wrong my friend.

28
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,959
Excuse me?

29
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:24,959
There is a fella in America,
who grants wishes.

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,959
Ad only one to a customer.

31
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,959
And who is this fella?

32
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:31,959
O.W. Grant.

33
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:33,959
That's his usual name,
he't got many others.

34
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,959
And he's a loose sun of a bitch.

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,959
You'd get easier time
finding a Jinni.

36
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,959
So how come, we've never heard
of this O.W. Grant?

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,959
You haven't heard O.W. Grant,
'cause America, is a much younger place than

38
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,959
Ireland or Arabia...
not too many people have had the chance to meet up with him.

39
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:49,959
Let me gess
You have.

40
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:52,959
I met him out at interstate 60.

41
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:56,959
Accidental. That's his way.
Folks don't find him, he finds them.

42
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,959
He just kinda happens in to them,
and they don't know, who he is or what he does...

43
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:02,959
until he does it.

44
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:04,959
And mostly messes with them, plays tricks,

45
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,959
'cause that's his way too,
but sometimes...

46
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,960
if he takes a shine to you...
he'll play it strait.

47
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,960
Now, one story says,
that his daddy was a Leprechaun...

48
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,960
came over here with Irish.

49
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:17,960
Now, midgets are notorious ???..

50
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,960
This leprechaun goes and knocks up a Shien Indian...

51
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,960
Shien get the land taken away
in the end up with the immortal, nomadic

52
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,879
half-breed with magical powers.

53
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,039
- Interstate 60, you said?
- Yhm

54
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,960
So, what does this O.W. Grant look like?

55
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:38,960
Red bow tie.

56
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:42,960
He smokes a pipe,
curved in an image of a monkey.

57
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:46,960
Maybe you'd be better of writing your theses
without mentioning O.W.

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,960
He'd probable rather not have
people known about him.

59
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:49,960
You got it.

60
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,520
Good night.

61
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:56,960
Hey Quincy, check this out

62
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,520
There is no Interstate 60.

63
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,960
I 65, 64, 66, and 69.

64
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,599
No I 60.

65
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,960
I guess tonight's everybody's fool-of-shit night.

66
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,960
Guy with a red bow tie and a monkey pipe,
who grants wishes...

67
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:16,360
Right.

68
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:27,960
No, damm it, look,

69
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,960
I need, that bidding before twelve...

70
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,479
yeah it's critical, just,
right call West...

71
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,599
Holy shit!

72
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:41,960
Broken jaw.

73
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,039
I'm sorry myster,
I didn't see you.

74
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,960
Are, are you OK
como on?

75
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:50,960
Are you all right?

76
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,680
Jesus.

77
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:54,960
Don't!
Stop!

78
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:55,960
Oh man!

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,960
My bike!

80
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,960
Look, I'm sorry
I'll pay

81
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:02,960
Oh God damm it!

82
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,960
Oh God damm it!
Look at my suit.

83
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:06,960
Oh shit...

84
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:07,960
Oh fuck.

85
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,960
I've got a sails meeting at 11 o'clock,
this is a fucken disaster.

86
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,960
My phone
is my fucken life line.

87
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,960
God damm it!

88
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,959
Oh I say everything happens
for a reason.

89
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,959
May I gues,
I just needed a new bike.

90
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,959
I, for one, did not need this shit
in my life.

91
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,959
Not today.
Of all fucken days!

92
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,959
Oh God damm it!
I wish, this had never happened!

93
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,959
I wish, it hadn't happened... I wish, it hadn't happened!

94
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:32,959
Was that your wish?

95
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:34,959
If you had a wish,
you wished, this hadn't happened?

96
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,720
Fucken-A right!

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:38,959
Granted!

98
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:40,959
Mr. Baker.

99
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:44,680
How did you know my name?

100
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:08,959
yeah, I need the bidding before 12...

101
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,959
yeah it is critical...

102
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,959
look, just call West
have him fax it to the main office...

103
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,759
Get it...
Speak up, I can't hear you.

104
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:20,199
I said...

105
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:28,920
Some people just don't know what to wish for.

106
00:05:54,959 --> 00:05:58,000
As for my part in this storie,
well, it began on a Tuesday.

107
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:58,959
September 18th.

108
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,920
My birthday.
My 22 birthday to be exact.

109
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:04,959
Oh, I'm Neal Oliver.

110
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,959
And this mess, is my apartment
in St. Louis. Missouri.

111
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,800
Where at this particular moment
I was at MajorDecision.com.

112
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:17,319
Should I wear a tie to lunch?

113
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,480
Damm.

114
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,959
Happy birthday Neal.

115
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,959
Truth.

116
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:39,959
You are not mad,
that I'm bailing on you tonight?

117
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:40,959
No, no no no.

118
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:44,959
I mean how cool it you be for you,
to bomb your pshytest because of some stupid concert

119
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,959
No aa. You have got to wait until lunch.
That is your family rules.

120
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,879
But you can open this.
I intercepted your snail mail.

121
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,959
It's the reality check.
I'm game over on the art scholarship.

122
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:00,000
We should at least open it.

123
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:02,399
I can tell a rejection by weight.

124
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:10,959
You are the wrong sex, the wrong colour
and your family has too much money. I'm sorry.

125
00:07:11,000 --> 00:07:14,959
Just don't, don't mention anything
to my old man, please.

126
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:15,959
You are so wired.

127
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:16,959
What?

128
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:19,959
Well, you actually suppose to cut your grapefruit in half
and eat it with a spoon

129
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,959
not peel it, and eat it like an orange.

130
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:24,959
Oh look... it's her.

131
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:25,959
Again.

132
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:27,959
Should I be like jealous?

133
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:30,959
Oh, maybe if she was real.

134
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:32,959
So, I had another dream about her,
last night.

135
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:35,959
She was in jail...
it's got to mean something.

136
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,959
I'll tell you what it means.
You saw her once somewhere

137
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,959
and made a subconscious impression,

138
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,399
the impression came back to you in a deam,
so you drew her

139
00:07:44,439 --> 00:07:47,959
which made the impression stronger.
You dream, you draw, you draw, you dream

140
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,920
Now it's a vicious cicle.
So quit drawing her, and it lid.

141
00:07:53,000 --> 00:07:54,399
Well, thank you Karl Young.

142
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:56,959
Fact is, I enjoy drawing her.

143
00:07:57,000 --> 00:07:59,959
But, am I...
Am I any good at this Sally?

144
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:01,959
'cause today is the deadline of the Conrada Competition.

145
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:03,959
Should I even inner these?

146
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:04,959
Don't ask me Neal.

147
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:06,959
I don't want to be judgmental.

148
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:14,000
But I do know, that just because you enjoy doing something,
doesn't necessarily mean that you should make it your career.

149
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:19,800
Should I enter a painting in a Conrada Competition?

150
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:34,960
Here,
No worries.

151
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,960
As I said it all started on my 22 birthday.

152
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:38,960
Specifically here.

153
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:40,960
At my traditional birthday lunch.

154
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:43,960
As always, my father has picked the restaurant.

155
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:45,960
Attending with the usual suspects.

156
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,960
Sally, who my parents actually liked
mabey even more than I did.

157
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,960
My dad. Daniel.
Atterney at law.

158
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:53,960
My mom. Marleen.
Atterneys wife.

159
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:55,960
And my sister
and best friend Nancy.

160
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:01,159
Put on earth by the grace of God,
to keep me from going insane.

161
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:14,960
So what did you wish for?
Please tell me that it was something about us.

162
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:17,960
I'm guessing...
He wished to go skydiving again.

163
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:20,600
God forbid.

164
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:22,960
Oh no, Neal you didn't.

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:24,960
Why, if I tell her, it wont come true.

166
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,960
Actually that's no wife's tail.

167
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:28,960
The truth is, you should always tell your wish.

168
00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,960
Kinda Carma thing.
Put it out there, project it.

169
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,960
Then it just might come true.

170
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:34,960
Never heard that before.

171
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,960
Oh, it's true.
Believe me.

172
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:37,960
I know.

173
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:40,639
I'll cut this for you.

174
00:09:41,399 --> 00:09:43,960
OK, so now you have to tell us.

175
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,639
Yeah, come on,
tell us Nelo.

176
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,279
I wished for...

177
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:54,960
an answer.

178
00:09:55,000 --> 00:09:57,960
An answer,OK
an answer to what?

179
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,960
An answer to my life.

180
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:01,960
Here it is.

181
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,960
Happy birthday son.

182
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,960
Your admition
to the Bradford Law Fellowship.

183
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:09,960
Just do the interviev
next month, on October 15th,

184
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,960
and you're in.

185
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:11,960
It's all aranged.
By me.

186
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:13,960
And you can take that to the bank.

187
00:10:14,000 --> 00:10:16,960
Dad, I told you,
I wasn't sure yet.

188
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:18,600
Well, I can be sure for the both of us.

189
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:23,960
Last candle gone.

190
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,960
Take it with you.

191
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:29,960
That is,
if you want your wish grant.

192
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,960
Thanks.

193
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,360
Oh, cool.

194
00:10:35,000 --> 00:10:38,200
That's my color too. Thank you.

195
00:10:49,000 --> 00:10:49,960
Sable brushes.

196
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,440
Nanc.
You are the best Nanc.

197
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:54,960
You are welcome.

198
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:56,960
As for last.

199
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,759
Happy birthday son.

200
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:04,960
Isn't it perfect?

201
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:05,960
Fire engin red.

202
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:09,960
You have no idea,
how hard it was to find a red convertable in this town.

203
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,879
Fule injected. 160 KM.
Phone.

204
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:16,960
Yeah, I even got you special plates.

205
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:20,200
Oh boy, I would have killed for a car like this,
when I was your age.

206
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,000
A, you know I thought it was high time for an image changen,
and what better way to start.

207
00:11:24,279 --> 00:11:28,960
Now, you see, the engine is a 2,5 liter...

208
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:30,960
As usuall,
it was all about him.

209
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:31,960
His idea of cool.

210
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,960
Red was his colour.
Not mine.

211
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,960
It was his pet fraze on the licence plates.

212
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:39,200
Clearely he was excepting me,
to become him.

213
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:41,960
Well? Isn't it the best present,
you could ever get?

214
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:44,879
It's awsome.
Come on Neal, take me for a ride.

215
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:47,960
Well, son...

216
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:48,960
Neal!

217
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:49,960
Oh my God!

218
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:51,960
Son!.

219
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,960
Somebody call 911.

220
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:56,960
Neal, Neal,
are you all right?

221
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,960
Talk to me son.

222
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,279
Neal.

223
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,559
<b>Get better soon honey,</b>
<b>Love Mom+Dad,</b>
<b>XO</b>

224
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:38,320
St. Louises finest increst.

225
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:41,960
You're all right Neal?

226
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,960
Yeah, yeah, just...

227
00:12:44,000 --> 00:12:45,960
it only hurts when I think.

228
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,480
They want to keep me overnight,
to log some tests in the morning

229
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:53,000
make sure,
my perception is like worked, yeah.

230
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,960
You're goddess, Nanc.

231
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:55,960
I know.

232
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,960
So, what's your perception
of a dad

233
00:12:59,000 --> 00:13:02,960
who buys you the gift,
he wants for him self?

234
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:04,960
About the same as toxic wastes.

235
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:06,960
Your perception is fine.

236
00:13:07,000 --> 00:13:11,960
That is one hell of a way
getting out of answering dad about the car.

237
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:14,960
Mom and dad are going to be here soon,
what are you gonna tell them?.

238
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:17,519
Lies.

239
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,960
The truth just gonna piss him of.

240
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,960
Well maybe that's a good thing.

241
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,960
No, no.

242
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:25,960
Because then I' gonna get the hole riff,
about how I'm letting him down

243
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,960
It's just easy if I role with it.

244
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,320
And maybe someone will steal it.

245
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:40,960
First a little visual warm up?

246
00:13:41,000 --> 00:13:44,960
I'll hold up a card, you name the suit.
I'm gonna go faster and faster.

247
00:13:45,000 --> 00:13:47,960
Let's see if you can keep up.

248
00:13:48,000 --> 00:13:49,960
OK.

249
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,960
Diamond.

250
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,960
Club.

251
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:53,960
Spade.

252
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:54,960
Hart.

253
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:55,960
Diamond.

254
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,960
Spade.

255
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,960
Diamond.

256
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:58,960
Hart.

257
00:13:59,000 --> 00:14:00,960
Club.
Spade.

258
00:14:01,000 --> 00:14:01,960
Hart.

259
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:02,960
Diamond.

260
00:14:03,000 --> 00:14:03,960
Club.
Hart.

261
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:04,960
Spade.
Diamond.

262
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:05,960
Club.
Spade.

263
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:06,960
Hart.

264
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:07,960
Club.

265
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:08,960
Spade.

266
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:11,360
Hart.

267
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:12,960
Did I pass?

268
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:15,240
No.

269
00:14:17,000 --> 00:14:18,960
But a few people do.

270
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,960
Black harts, red spades?.

271
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,960
Come on,
that's like cheating.

272
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,960
Aa, experience has conditioned you,
thinking that all harts are red,

273
00:14:27,000 --> 00:14:28,960
and all spades are black.

274
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:29,960
Because their shapes are similar.

275
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:32,960
It's easier for your mind
to interpret them...

276
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:33,960
based on that passed experience.

277
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,960
Then open to an idea that they can be different.

278
00:14:37,000 --> 00:14:38,960
We see what we expect to see.

279
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:41,960
Not necessarily, what's really there.

280
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,960
Children,
who have never played cards, always pass this test.

281
00:14:47,000 --> 00:14:52,600
Makes you wonder how many other things
are right in front of you, sight, sound, smell

282
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:55,960
that you can't expirience,
because you've been conditioned not to?

283
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,960
If we'll do the test again
you will pass.

284
00:14:59,000 --> 00:15:02,960
Once you are aware,
that their can be black harts and red spades,

285
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:04,960
you'll be able to parse them.

286
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:08,399
Your brain is wired,
just like the Interstate highways system.

287
00:15:08,440 --> 00:15:10,960
It's easy
to go from one well to the other place

288
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:15,960
But the places in between, off the highway.

289
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,759
Even thou they're there, most people just zip right pass them.

290
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,960
Well, that's cool trick

291
00:15:23,000 --> 00:15:25,960
But there aren't any card games with red spades and black harts.

292
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,000
Well, how do you know?

293
00:15:35,000 --> 00:15:36,960
Mr. Oliver.
I'm Dr. Craig.

294
00:15:37,000 --> 00:15:39,960
You ready to take some tests?

295
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:42,240
Yeah.

296
00:15:43,200 --> 00:15:45,960
Well, that was,
some wormer beck you got there, that guy Rey.

297
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:46,960
Who?

298
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:49,799
Ray...
you know, that guy, who was, he just left.

299
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:50,960
You know, the tricked cards.

300
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:53,960
No, there is no one on staff, named Ray.

301
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,960
No, he was just here.

302
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,960
Wacky guy, with the cards...
with the light-green lapcote.

303
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,000
The staff wears blue here,
not green.

304
00:16:00,000 --> 00:16:04,960
But we can test your color perception.

305
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:08,200
Dropped seven of harts.

306
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:13,639
Come on in son.

307
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,960
So, how's that new car?.

308
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,399
- Awesome?
- Yeah dad... it's very awesome.

309
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:24,120
What is on your mind, son?

310
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,960
I'm not so sure
about this Bradford thing, dad.

311
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:32,759
Seams little too easy, you know.

312
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:35,960
I spent years working very hard,
so it would be easy for you.

313
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,960
What? You want to work nights
in that warehous for the rest rest of your life?

314
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,960
Come on dad,
that just so i don't have to ask you for cash.

315
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:42,960
Son, let me give you
some Daniel Olivier philosophy.

316
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:44,960
And you can take it to the bank.

317
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:46,960
When ever someon ofers you an advantage,
take it.

318
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:48,960
And this program is an adventage.

319
00:16:49,000 --> 00:16:51,960
It will get you
to any law school in the country.

320
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:52,960
America needs another lawyer.

321
00:16:53,000 --> 00:16:56,960
Another good lawyer.
We can always use one of those.

322
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,960
- That was costs 30 000?
32 200.

323
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,399
I out bid two major collectors,
to get it.

324
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:04,599
It's a lot of money for a drop cloth.

325
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,960
That shows you how much you know
That is Franklin Samuel original.

326
00:17:07,000 --> 00:17:09,960
He's a name artist.
If you ever sell anything,

327
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:14,960
the operative wolud been if,
maybe... maybe... your opinion will count.

328
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:16,960
Look dad,
I'm just not sure, OK?

329
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:19,960
I thought about,
maby taking some time off.

330
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:21,960
Time off for what?

331
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:24,960
Sort of take stock, you know,
tray figure somethings out.

332
00:17:25,000 --> 00:17:26,400
Wast your time with your art?

333
00:17:26,440 --> 00:17:29,599
It's a hobby son.
Would you live it that?

334
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,960
Look, I got you into Bradford,
because Prat's on the bord,

335
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:33,960
and he wont be next year.

336
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,960
So if you don't take adventage of it now,
there wont be a next time.

337
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:38,960
Why not just go thru the program?

338
00:17:39,000 --> 00:17:43,960
If you ultimately decide, law school is not for you,
then, I'll... live with it.

339
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:48,960
But at least you'll be Bradford ???
and that's something you can always take to the bank.

340
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:51,960
Then you can... figure things out.

341
00:17:52,000 --> 00:17:53,960
So you're going Bradford, ha.

342
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:56,960
- I thought you weren't sure.
- I'm not.

343
00:17:57,000 --> 00:17:58,960
I think it would be stupid,
not to at least give it a shot.

344
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:01,960
Can't let down the old man.

345
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:03,960
Bouth you of a fancy car?

346
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:05,960
He's maximaizing his options Hrank,
It's very mature.

347
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,400
We should be saportive,
not judgemental.

348
00:18:17,000 --> 00:18:20,759
Look for the good in your felloman.

349
00:18:21,000 --> 00:18:24,960
The warm wind of romance
blows around you.

350
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:29,319
With good helth,
prosperity will follow.

351
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,960
October 15th.
That's the day of my Bradford interviev.

352
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,519
Let me see that.

353
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:44,000
OK, you got me.
It's blank.

354
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,839
What the hell?

355
00:18:57,000 --> 00:18:59,960
I would never get on that shit, never.

356
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:02,960
Just, leve everything behind,
not know where are you going.

357
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:04,960
I can't believe that you would Neal.

358
00:19:05,000 --> 00:19:09,400
Just, leve your friends,  and your family,
and for what?

359
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:13,759
Hey, earth to Neal.
What's the matter?

360
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,960
Sally my fortune.

361
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:17,960
Didn't it say:
October 15th, are you sure?

362
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:18,960
Obviousely it didn't.

363
00:19:19,000 --> 00:19:21,599
At the restaurant, when I showed it to you,
isn't that what it said?

364
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:22,960
Why do you make such a big deal about this?

365
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:25,960
Because it is bugging me.
That's why.

366
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:29,960
You're just projecting your anxiety, about your decision,
and that is natural.

367
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,960
It's OK.
You'll do grate.

368
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:36,160
Because that's who you are.

369
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:39,960
Here.. Just take a nice deep breath, relax.

370
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:40,960
Sally, listen to me.

371
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:42,960
What are the chances?

372
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:44,960
That of all cookies in that kitchen,

373
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,960
that exact one ended up on a plate,
that was taken to our table,

374
00:19:48,000 --> 00:19:48,960
and I picked it?

375
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:49,960
It was blank, Neal.

376
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:54,240
The fortune was blank.
You projected.

377
00:19:57,000 --> 00:19:58,960
I projected?

378
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:00,000
Right.

379
00:20:00,039 --> 00:20:05,960
That was the politicaly correct way to say I was seeing things.

380
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,960
I worked graveyard shifts at the grocert wearhouse,
filling orders for the trucks to take to the verious stores in the morning.

381
00:20:11,000 --> 00:20:12,960
I liked it for three reasons.

382
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:13,960
I got the job on my own.

383
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:16,960
It paid enough,
that I didn't have to ask the old man for cash.

384
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:21,960
And it annoyed Daniel
that his son was even working at such a low-clas job.

385
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:26,799
I hear you are quit'n
to become some big shot lawyer in new fancyass car, hm?

386
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,160
Well, lucky dud.

387
00:20:30,200 --> 00:20:31,960
Hey, Curby.
Get the kid a brake.

388
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:34,960
You just remember that
no mather haw hard shit you think you are,

389
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,960
Its always gonna be more the same.

390
00:20:37,000 --> 00:20:38,960
Another Highschool.

391
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:39,960
- Highschool?
- Hell yeah.

392
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:42,960
Everything in life is like Highschool.
The're just chang'n names.

393
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:44,960
You take this place.

394
00:20:45,000 --> 00:20:46,960
Insted of pronciple,
we've got boss.

395
00:20:47,000 --> 00:20:48,960
Insted of teachers,
supervisors.

396
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:51,960
Insted of asignments,
they give us work orders,

397
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:54,960
and, if you fuck up them work orders you,
get fired.

398
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:57,960
Insted expelled.

399
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:01,960
Oh yeah, names are different,
but it is exact same shit.

400
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,440
Highschool.

401
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:08,799
Damaged goods.

402
00:21:08,839 --> 00:21:15,039
Well, store can't sell them.
Guess I'll just have to take it of their hands.

403
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:21,960
Is he right Otis?
Is everything more the same?

404
00:21:22,000 --> 00:21:23,960
Yeah, if you look at it like that.

405
00:21:24,000 --> 00:21:26,960
I mean, look at me,
I show up here, see the same people,

406
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:28,960
take shipement to the stores,

407
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:31,960
see those same people,
eat at the same places,

408
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:35,960
see those same people...
but not really.

409
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:36,960
See.

410
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:40,960
I like seeing those people.
Well most of them any way.

411
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:43,960
If I want something different,
I can make it different, go a different way.

412
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,960
Eat at a different place,
do an Interstate gig.

413
00:21:48,000 --> 00:21:51,559
See I never went to highschool...

414
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:52,960
Look at them.

415
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:55,960
In the morning thay will get up,
and go to the store.

416
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,960
And the paste will be on the shelves where it always is,

417
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:00,960
and not one of them will give
a moment's startles to how it got there.

418
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:02,960
Holy shit.

419
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:05,440
That's her.

420
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,960
I must have seen her on the bilbord,
and that's how she got in my dreams.

421
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:10,960
You dream about her?

422
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:12,960
Yeah,yeah,
Yes.

423
00:22:13,000 --> 00:22:13,960
Pretty silly, huh.

424
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,960
Maybe it means something.

425
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:17,960
Like what?

426
00:22:18,000 --> 00:22:19,960
Like the thunderbolt, you know,
love at the first sight.

427
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,960
Come on Otis, that's just ferrietales stuff.

428
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:24,960
That's how I met my wife.

429
00:22:25,000 --> 00:22:28,960
Spotted her in a crowd at the river fornt,
4th of July fireworks.

430
00:22:29,000 --> 00:22:31,960
Couldn't take my eyes of her.
Fireworks were up there,

431
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:33,960
but I was stearing at her.

432
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,960
And I just knew.

433
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:40,960
Well. See, all my girlfriends,
are awlays a reaction to the one I had last.

434
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:44,960
Jennet was so opinionated about my art,
it drowe me crazy.

435
00:22:45,000 --> 00:22:47,960
So I found Sally,
who refuses to be judgemental about it.

436
00:22:48,000 --> 00:22:50,960
Meanwhile she's
trying to psychoanalyse my.

437
00:22:51,000 --> 00:22:53,960
So she is not the one either.

438
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:55,960
Maybe you should go after her?

439
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:00,000
Girl like that. She's a model,
she's probably got guys fallen all over her

440
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:02,599
Guys with big portfolios.

441
00:23:03,000 --> 00:23:04,960
Yeah, I think it's kinda childish idea.

442
00:23:05,000 --> 00:23:07,960
Chasing a dream.

443
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:18,960
Hi, your bilboard on Delmar&Wicker's,
the one on the side of the building?

444
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:21,960
Yeah, whose adagency is that?

445
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:23,960
No, no no... Next to the Casino Queen bilbord.

446
00:23:24,000 --> 00:23:28,400
The girls with the phone,
says: There is another choice

447
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,960
Blank?! No, no It can't be blank.

448
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,400
I was just there.
I just saw it.

449
00:23:34,079 --> 00:23:36,000
No, I just saw it!

450
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:47,960

Black Harts, or red Spades.

00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:03,960
What's it all about?

471
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:04,960
It's all about you, Neal.

What's in here, any way?

479
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:22,359
Can't really say.

480
00:26:22,400 --> 00:26:25,960
Yoy can't really say, because you don't know,
or you do want, and don't want me to know?

481
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,960
Either way, the result is the same.

482
00:26:29,000 --> 00:26:30,960
So what is this job pay?

483
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:32,960
Can't really say.

484
00:26:33,000 --> 00:26:33,960
What's the catch?

485
00:26:34,000 --> 00:26:35,960

00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:37,960
Alwayes wanted the answers,

Consider it, an interesting way to break in the new century.

488
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:45,960
Or simply,
a way to break in that new car.

489
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:48,960
Before the Bradford interviev.

490
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:51,960
How do you know about that?

491
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:54,440
Open it.

492
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:06,440
Sit down.

493
00:27:09,000 --> 00:27:09,960

you agree to deliver it.

495
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:18,960
You don't loose it, you don't open it,
and you don't trie to find out what's inside it.

496
00:27:19,000 --> 00:27:21,960

Delivery date is October 2th.

499
00:27:28,000 --> 00:27:32,599
So you'll have time to visite some towns,
meet some people.

500
00:27:32,640 --> 00:27:33,960
See what's out there.

501
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,960
Pick up some traveler's tales.

502
00:27:37,000 --> 00:27:39,960
High way expiriences.

503
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,839
Episodes of the Rode.

504
00:27:43,000 --> 00:27:44,960
This is too surreal.

505
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:50,599
I mean, you, this office,
the 13 floor of a building that has no 13 floor

506
00:27:51,000 --> 00:27:54,599
My alarm clock gonna go off any second.

507
00:27:55,000 --> 00:27:57,759
Rise and shine.

508
00:27:59,000 --> 00:28:05,079
You'll awake Neal.
Could be your awake for the first time in your life.

509
00:28:11,000 --> 00:28:14,079
It's our standard fold.

510
00:28:21,000 --> 00:28:23,960
And I leed you to seal it with the drop of your blood.

511
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:24,960
Blood?

512
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:28,599
Of course.
I'm the DEVIL.

513
00:28:29,000 --> 00:28:30,960
Just kidding.

514
00:28:31,000 --> 00:28:35,759
Tradicionally, a man means what he says,
he'll put his blood where his mouth is.

515
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:41,680
All right.

516
00:28:43,000 --> 00:28:44,960
Oh, one more thing.

517
00:28:45,000 --> 00:28:49,279
There's a killer out there.
So be carefull

518
00:28:51,000 --> 00:28:51,960
Now you tell me?

519
00:28:52,000 --> 00:28:52,960
After I sign?

520
00:28:53,000 --> 00:28:55,960
The journey of life
always includes a possibility od deth.

521
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,960
This killer,
what does he look like?

522
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:01,960
-Who said it's a man?
- It's a woman?

523
00:29:02,000 --> 00:29:04,960
It's not this Robin Fields, is it?

524
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:08,799
I know... you can't really say.

525
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,960
I didn't misspell the name of that town.

526
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:15,960
You'll find it.

527
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:18,960
Just go west, on Interstate 60.

528
00:29:19,000 --> 00:29:22,960
Look, we've been over this.
There is no Intestate 60.

529
00:29:23,000 --> 00:29:24,960
There's US 60.
But there is no interstatep 60.

530
00:29:25,000 --> 00:29:26,960
Look... there's got to be.

531
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:28,960
Well look at here. Here is 70.

532
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:31,960
The next major route south is 40.

533
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:36,960
So if there was an I 60,
it would have to be some where between 70 and 40.

534
00:29:37,000 --> 00:29:38,960
But, ass you can see, it's not there.

535
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:40,400
It simply doesn't exist.

536
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:43,960
Where do you find a highway, that doesn't exist?

537
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:46,960
Well, I decided to look where it be if it did exist.

538
00:29:47,000 --> 00:29:50,960
Ray said, you don't find hidden places,
by sticking to the well travelled routs

539
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,440
So, I skipped well travelled Interstere 55,
and went south on Boob Dylan's highway 61.

540
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,960
And there she was again.

541
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:09,960
Telling me, I was right.

542
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:12,920
I was fast becoming a believer in signs.

543
00:30:19,000 --> 00:30:21,960
It's you I'm delivering this package, isn't it?

544
00:30:22,000 --> 00:30:25,400
You're Robin Fields.

545
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,960
Now it makes all sense.

546
00:30:29,000 --> 00:30:30,960
Cool. Very cool.

547
00:30:31,000 --> 00:30:34,200
Very, very cool.

548
00:31:04,000 --> 00:31:05,960
You are the waiter, from my birthday party

549
00:31:06,000 --> 00:31:07,960
O.W. Grant.

550
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:08,960
Neal Oliver.

551
00:31:09,000 --> 00:31:11,960
It's a strange coincidence,
seeing you here again.

552
00:31:12,000 --> 00:31:13,960
Onely if you believe in coincidence.

553
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,960
I prefer inevitability.

554
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:17,000
Every event is inevitable.

555
00:31:17,039 --> 00:31:19,960
If it wasn't, it wouldn't happen.

556
00:31:20,000 --> 00:31:22,359
Right.

557
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:27,319
Oh, I forgor to give you, your birthday present.

558
00:31:37,000 --> 00:31:38,960
Remember your wish?

559
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:39,960
An answer.

560
00:31:40,000 --> 00:31:40,960
- Yeah
- That's grate.

561
00:31:41,000 --> 00:31:42,960
Yeah, gets grater.

562
00:31:43,000 --> 00:31:44,960
Go on, go ahead. Try it.

563
00:31:45,000 --> 00:31:48,000
Yes or No questions.

564
00:31:48,039 --> 00:31:52,960
OK, yhm...
Eight ball, is there an Interstate 60.

565
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:05,799
I told you, it get grater.

566
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:06,960
Who are you mister?

567
00:32:07,000 --> 00:32:10,240
The O.W stadns for One Wish.

568
00:32:11,000 --> 00:32:11,960
That's what I do.

569
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:12,960
I grant wishes.

570
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,960
One to a customer.

571
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:16,960
Your was more interesting,
then most.

572
00:32:17,000 --> 00:32:17,960
Opening.

573
00:32:18,000 --> 00:32:19,960
Sicnefies(?) story(?) insted of greed.

574
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:21,960
That's what I get most of the time.

575
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,960
gimmi, gimmi, gimmi,

576
00:32:23,000 --> 00:32:24,960
gimmi this, gimmi that...

577
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,960
Usually money, or sex,
or easy living.

578
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:31,920
How I deliver.
Yeah, that depends on what ???.

579
00:32:33,000 --> 00:32:36,920
Eith Ball, is this guy bullshititng me?

580
00:32:45,000 --> 00:32:47,440
Come on.

581
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:51,079
Let's find that rode.

582
00:32:56,000 --> 00:32:59,960
Now, one young couple wished to be married.
Live happyly ever after.

583
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:04,960
So I blue up their car.
At the hurch, on the way to the huneymoon.

584
00:33:05,000 --> 00:33:07,960
Another guy. He wanted grate, perfect sex every day,

585
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:09,960
with his choice gorgeous wommen. No pregnancys.

586
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:10,960
So...

587
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:14,960
Everyday ther is a FedEx delivery...
of a skin magazine...

588
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:15,960
box of tissues.

589
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:19,559
There's the Stop sign.
Turn right.

590
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:39,240
There is a sign post,
up ahead.

591
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:45,200
Son of a bitch.
I found it.

592
00:33:48,000 --> 00:33:51,240
It was inevitable.

593
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:17,960
So, I thought all Interstaes were divided highways,
with limited acces.

594
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:23,800
No, when highway doesn't officially exist.
The rules don't apply.

595
00:34:27,000 --> 00:34:29,960
OK, so how is it, we're on a highway,
that is on any map,

596
00:34:30,000 --> 00:34:31,960
going to a towns, that presumably don't exist?

597
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:37,599
Well, there are unlisted phone numbers, right?
So, why can't there be unlisted highways and towns?

598
00:34:37,639 --> 00:34:39,960
I don't buy it.
There's got to be a better explenation, than that.

599
00:34:40,000 --> 00:34:42,960
Better explenation.

600
00:34:43,000 --> 00:34:46,880
OK. How about it's a...
parallel dimention.

601
00:34:47,000 --> 00:34:47,960
Or you're in a dream.

602
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
Or it has something to do
with your wish.

603
00:34:50,039 --> 00:34:51,960
Or... you're in a coma
from when that bucket hit you.

604
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:55,400
Or maybe...
jusy maybe...

605
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,639
You're dead.

606
00:34:59,000 --> 00:35:00,960
Well?

607
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,960
Well, what do you want kid?

608
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,960
I just gave you not one explenation,
but six.

609
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:06,960
All reasonable.

610
00:35:07,000 --> 00:35:08,400
You want an answer,
pick one.

611
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,960
It want change anything.

612
00:35:10,000 --> 00:35:12,960
You, you took a job,
and now you got to do it.

613
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:14,960
Yeah, but it could change something.

614
00:35:15,000 --> 00:35:16,960
So, what if I'm dead?

615
00:35:17,519 --> 00:35:19,000
What if I'm dead, right now.

616
00:35:19,000 --> 00:35:20,960
There is no reason,
why shouldn't drive on oncoming traffic, right?

617
00:35:21,000 --> 00:35:24,079
OK, go ahead.
Try it.

618
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,960
But that's way you accelerated in way of the big semity,
comming at us,

619
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,960
which should be in about 25 seconds, I figure.

620
00:35:32,000 --> 00:35:34,960
Come to this.
Now, if you are dead...

621
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:36,519
Then, this is the after life,

622
00:35:36,519 --> 00:35:39,480
and you made a deal with a guy,
sealed in blood,

623
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:41,960
who knew everything about you,
even what you are going to say, befor you said it.

624
00:35:42,000 --> 00:35:44,960
Now who do you think,
that guy might be?

625
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:49,000
And...
do you think it is a good idea to piss him of?

626
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,960
Maybe you good a point.

627
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:00,599
Maby I do.

628
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,280
Oh, I love this highway.

629
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:12,960
Me?
I can sattle my selfe an artist, too.

630
00:36:13,000 --> 00:36:15,960
I see life, ass..
art appreciation.

631
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,960
You know,
some artist can't stand the sight of their work once it's finisher.

632
00:36:19,000 --> 00:36:21,960
Me, I'm one of my own biggest fans.

633
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,960
And one of my favourites,
will be comming through that door... any moment..

634
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:29,360
Now.

635
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:45,960
Yeah, can I take your order?

636
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,960
15 double-cheeseburgers, please.

637
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:49,960
15 double-cheese to go.

638
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,960
Oh, not to go.
I'll eat them here.

639
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:52,960
Hold the order.

640
00:36:53,000 --> 00:36:55,960
You're going to eat 15 double-cheeseburgers,
all by your self?

641
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:56,960
Yeah.

642
00:36:57,000 --> 00:36:58,960
Why, they are real big?
You think 15 to many?

643
00:36:59,000 --> 00:37:01,960
Way to many.

644
00:37:03,000 --> 00:37:05,960
All right. Twelve then.
Even dozen.

645
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:07,960
Look,
are you drunk or something mr.?

646
00:37:08,000 --> 00:37:11,960
Well I don't know.
Can you get drunk on six beer?

647
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:15,199
Hay fella.
I've got a hundret says that you can't eat six double-cheese,

648
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:16,960
as much as twelve.

649
00:37:17,000 --> 00:37:19,960
So, what you're saying is,
they're really big cheeseburgers?

650
00:37:20,000 --> 00:37:22,960
My hundret says you can't eat six double-cheese.

651
00:37:23,000 --> 00:37:26,880
Well, I'm kinda hungry.
maby you're right.

652
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,960
Twelve is to many burgers.
I'll tell you what?

653
00:37:29,000 --> 00:37:36,960
Make it two double-cheese, three orders of fried chicken, one be-all tee,
to hams swiss on rie, chicken fried stake,

654
00:37:37,000 --> 00:37:40,960
Turkey club and, two bolls chilli extra onions.

655
00:37:41,000 --> 00:37:43,960
And one piece of each of those pies.

656
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:45,960
One piece of each of thiese pies?

657
00:37:46,000 --> 00:37:47,960
Anything else?

658
00:37:48,000 --> 00:37:49,960
Three order onion rings.

659
00:37:50,000 --> 00:37:53,960
That's much more sensible lunch,
than twelve double-cheeseburgers.

660
00:37:54,000 --> 00:37:56,719
Oh, and old pickles.

661
00:37:58,000 --> 00:37:59,960
Free bucks.

662
00:38:00,000 --> 00:38:04,159
If you can finishe all that food,
in one hour.

663
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:09,000
Whit out getting up from that counter,
and without losing your lunch.

664
00:38:10,000 --> 00:38:11,960
I'm not much of a bet, man.

665
00:38:12,000 --> 00:38:15,719
Two to One odds then...
no, no I'll give you Three to One.

666
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:19,960
That's 300 to mine...
against 100 to yours.

667
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:22,800
Well, what the Hell.

668
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:26,119
It's onely money.

669
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:31,199
Hal...

670
00:38:31,239 --> 00:38:32,960
You better hold one to this money.

671
00:38:33,000 --> 00:38:35,360
Sure.

672
00:38:37,000 --> 00:38:38,960
Yeah, I'll take some of that.

673
00:38:39,000 --> 00:38:41,960
Eight Ball, is this guy gonna really eat all that food?

674
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:50,960
Can I yhm...
Can I get on this action?

675
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:51,960
Ask him.

676
00:38:52,000 --> 00:38:53,960
No I like long shots.

677
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:55,960
You're crazy your knees.

678
00:38:56,000 --> 00:38:57,960
My money just ass good, right.

679
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:00,000
Hell about me.

680
00:39:00,039 --> 00:39:04,000
Sir,
you want to drink anything with that?

681
00:39:12,000 --> 00:39:13,960
There's your order.

682
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,880
All right. It's 13:10.
On your mark... Get set...

683
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,440
Wait.

684
00:39:21,000 --> 00:39:24,000
Ketchup, please.

685
00:40:00,000 --> 00:40:02,000
Thanks.

686
00:40:02,039 --> 00:40:03,960
All right... What's the trick?

687
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:04,960
Trick?

688
00:40:05,000 --> 00:40:05,960
Where is the food?

689
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:07,960
Can't all be in your stomach.

690
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,960
Actually, I don't know.

691
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,960
The fact is, I always loved eating.
More then anything.

692
00:40:13,000 --> 00:40:15,960
Go into a restaurant,
want to order everything of the menu.

693
00:40:16,000 --> 00:40:20,960
But, I was always frustrated,
by the small capacity of me stomach.

694
00:40:21,000 --> 00:40:24,960
Well, 17 years ago,
I made a wish...

695
00:40:25,000 --> 00:40:27,960
And amazingly enough it came true.

696
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:30,960
Now I have, what you might call,
a black hole in my belly.

697
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:33,960
Onely I have to keep eating like this,
six or seven times a day.

698
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,960
Gets expensive.

699
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:41,639
So, I travel a lot,
and get advantage on guys like you.

700
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:44,800
That's a good one.

701
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:46,360
Excuse me, mister.

702
00:40:47,599 --> 00:40:49,400
I've got to know one thing.

703
00:40:49,599 --> 00:40:51,960
Do you still love eating?

704
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:56,039
No...
now it'a a drag.

705
00:40:58,000 --> 00:40:59,960
Listen kid...

706
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:03,960
Nobody minds money taken by that guy,
he gave us good show for our money.

707
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:05,960
But I drow a line over what you did.

708
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:06,960
What did I do?

709
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:08,400
I just bet the right horse, that's all.

710
00:41:08,440 --> 00:41:10,960
You run on it. I know a hustle when I see one.

711
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,960
I played a hunch, I swear to God.
I've never seen that guy befor in ymy life

712
00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:14,960
But your friend, there has.

713
00:41:15,000 --> 00:41:16,960
Haven't you fella?

714
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:18,960
Oh, I wont deny it.

715
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,960
Now,
get beck the money you stole, son.

716
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:24,960
Look sir, I won a cupple bets.
If that's such a crime why dont we call the police.

717
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:28,079
I am the police.

718
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,719
Sorry about that.

719
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:35,960
That's all my money.

720
00:41:36,000 --> 00:41:37,599
Hit the rode, fellas.

721
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:44,599
OK, so what's your game mr. Grant.
'cause it seams like you know exactly what's gonna happen,

722
00:41:44,639 --> 00:41:45,599
just before it happens,

723
00:41:45,639 --> 00:41:46,960
and it's just like
fucking with me!

724
00:41:47,000 --> 00:41:48,960
Oh, don't take it personal kid.

725
00:41:49,000 --> 00:41:50,960
I fuck with everybody.

726
00:41:51,000 --> 00:41:51,960
That's what I do.

727
00:41:52,000 --> 00:41:55,960
If I tie highly recommended as an unending sorce of amusement.

728
00:41:56,000 --> 00:41:59,960
And as far as knowing what's gonna happen.
Well... on this highway,

729
00:42:00,000 --> 00:42:01,960
the past, the present, the future,

730
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,679
the "What if some maybe's, rodes not taken",

731
00:42:06,000 --> 00:42:08,960
could all converge, get jumble up.

732
00:42:09,000 --> 00:42:12,960
I just happen to be tuned into it.
That's all.

733
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:16,000
So what are you?
Like an Angel or God, or something?

734
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:19,119
Just, picking up certalin people to give him a wish?

735
00:42:19,159 --> 00:42:21,960
No... no,
just a guy who likes to mess with peoples heds.

736
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,280
I'm a Joker...
in life's deck.

737
00:42:27,199 --> 00:42:28,960
But, why do it?

738
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:29,960
I enjoy it.

739
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:32,960
You should always find something to do,
that you enjoy.

740
00:42:33,000 --> 00:42:36,960
Although I will admit I have been concidering a career change.

741
00:42:37,000 --> 00:42:38,960
Job in a convenience store...

742
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:40,000
Or maybe becoming...

743
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:42,960
a male prostitute.

744
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:45,800
You're gey?

745
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:50,000
- You're fucking with me, aren't you?
- Yeah.

746
00:42:50,039 --> 00:42:52,960
Fact is I'm a virgin.

747
00:42:53,000 --> 00:42:54,960
I always will be.

748
00:42:55,000 --> 00:42:58,000
My penis...
was cut off i a very wird accident,

749
00:42:58,000 --> 00:42:58,960
when I was nine.

750
00:42:59,000 --> 00:43:01,639
Yeah, right.

751
00:43:02,000 --> 00:43:04,960
You want to see it?

752
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:08,800
Yeah... show me.

753
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:18,840
Holy shit.

754
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:21,960
Oh, God...

755
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:26,960
Oh, let me tell you, the world is very different pace,
when you're not constantly thinking about sex.

756
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,960
or responding sexually to everything...

757
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,239
Yeah.

758
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,960
That is a ruby.

759
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:35,960
Wait, how would you know?

760
00:43:36,000 --> 00:43:38,960
How would you know,
what it's like to not have something, you never had?

761
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,960
Now you're thinking.

762
00:43:41,000 --> 00:43:43,960
You'd be suprised,
how many people take that statement on faith.

763
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:46,960
Sounds right,
so they just except it.

764
00:43:47,000 --> 00:43:47,960
As I say.

765
00:43:48,000 --> 00:43:51,960
Messing with peoples heads,
can be a lot of fun.

766
00:43:52,000 --> 00:43:53,960
You should try it.

767
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,599
Some nice scenery coming up ahead.

768
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:13,960
Hello Lyn...
you're going my way?

769
00:44:14,000 --> 00:44:15,960
If you're going west.

770
00:44:16,000 --> 00:44:16,960
Then, that's my way.

771
00:44:17,000 --> 00:44:20,960
Hey, why don't you hop in the back,
bacause huggy here is gonna wanna take a good luck at me,

772
00:44:21,000 --> 00:44:23,960
and if I'm in the front,
he'll have a better view.

773
00:44:24,000 --> 00:44:28,559
And if you're in the back...
so will you.

774
00:44:33,000 --> 00:44:33,960
I'm Laura.

775
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:34,960
Neal.

776
00:44:35,000 --> 00:44:37,920
Oh, and that's Mr. Grant.

777
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,960
So, where you going Lauro?

778
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:40,960
Me?

779
00:44:41,000 --> 00:44:43,599
Oh, I'm going to a...

780
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:47,519
find a perfect fuck.

781
00:44:48,000 --> 00:44:49,960
Wow, that's an interesting destination.

782
00:44:50,000 --> 00:44:50,960
Yeah, ever been ther?

783
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:52,960
- Can't say that I have.
- Me either.

784
00:44:53,000 --> 00:44:56,800
But so far chips have been pretty exciting.

785
00:44:56,840 --> 00:44:59,960
Onely, how will you know,
when you'v gotten there?

786
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:02,960
That is the problem.
It's actually become my obsession,

787
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,719
but you don't need to here about it.

788
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:07,960
Sure, sure I do.

789
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:10,400
The first time, wasn't that grate.

790
00:45:10,440 --> 00:45:11,599
I'm thinking:
This is it?

791
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:15,960
This is what all these songs are written about?
I mean, talk about ???.

792
00:45:16,000 --> 00:45:17,960
Second time was a little bit better.

793
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,800
Third time, now that was a hot time.

794
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,960
Forth time, not as good as the third time.

795
00:45:25,000 --> 00:45:29,960
But once I've done it enough to have all this expiriences to compare,
just drove me nuts.

796
00:45:30,000 --> 00:45:32,960
I mean,
what if the best one was right around the corner?

797
00:45:33,000 --> 00:45:36,800
You know, how much better,
would the perfect one be?

798
00:45:37,000 --> 00:45:38,960
So this became my quest.

799
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,960
No, there is times,
when wish I've gone to the convent.

800
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,960
But my obsession,
becomes your opportunities.

801
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:51,360
You little stun muffin.
You want to take adventage of a girl that can't say no?

802
00:45:52,000 --> 00:45:53,960
Any guy turned you down before?

803
00:45:54,000 --> 00:45:57,440
No, unless he was gey.

804
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:03,320
OK...
What number would I be?

805
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:09,320
2461.

806
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:15,960
But I have got a very,
very good hearing about you,

807
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:19,880
and there's something very, very special.

808
00:46:21,199 --> 00:46:23,960
- I think I'm gonna pass, Laura.
- What do you mean, you pass?

809
00:46:24,000 --> 00:46:27,320
Guyes don't pass.

810
00:46:27,360 --> 00:46:30,960
Oh, I'm clean, there is no disease,
if that's what you're worried about.

811
00:46:31,000 --> 00:46:35,280
I've got condoms...
all best kinds.

812
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:39,440
Come on Neal...
stick it to me.

813
00:46:47,000 --> 00:46:48,960
I'm not doing it. Period.

814
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,960
So, you just.
You are not man enough?

815
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:54,960
You meet a real woman
and you turn in to a wuss?

816
00:46:55,000 --> 00:46:56,960
Think you want measure up, hm?

817
00:46:57,000 --> 00:46:58,960
Well, you'll never know,
will you?

818
00:46:59,000 --> 00:47:00,960
Because if I don't do it...

819
00:47:01,000 --> 00:47:03,960
I want be number 2000 and whatever.

820
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:04,960
I'll be number One.

821
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,960
That one guy.
Guy you will remember for the rest of your life.

822
00:47:08,000 --> 00:47:10,960
You stay up at night,
thinking about me, wondering,

823
00:47:11,000 --> 00:47:12,960
Was he the One?

824
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:15,960
The answer is yes.
I am the perfect fuck.

825
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:16,960
The one you never had...

826
00:47:17,000 --> 00:47:17,960
Perfect on every way...

827
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:20,960
Look, stop it, stop it...

828
00:47:21,000 --> 00:47:23,960
This is Zen thing, it's amazing...
I've never been perfect in anything befor.

829
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:26,960
Well, you can fuck me.

830
00:47:27,000 --> 00:47:29,960
My mind fuck, and it was terrible.

831
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:31,960
It was good for me.

832
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:33,199
What about you Mr.?

833
00:47:33,239 --> 00:47:34,960
I'll bet,
you're a real man.

834
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,960
You're man enough to be in my book?

835
00:47:37,000 --> 00:47:38,960
Oh, Hell yes.
Put me down in there.

836
00:47:39,000 --> 00:47:43,880
But I sometimes got little troubles...
getting excited.

837
00:47:46,000 --> 00:47:48,840
Let me take care of that baby.

838
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:15,400
Now, that's a museum you'd really appreciate.

839
00:48:18,000 --> 00:48:19,960
What is it? A bunch of bogass paintings

840
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:21,960
Stop in Renburg.
Have a look.

841
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:26,480
You'll find it very...
thought provoking.

842
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:30,960
450 mile to  Danver.

843
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:33,960
Quarter tank of gas, and no money.

844
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:39,519
Well, by Columbus had sailed,
he didn't know if it had any wind.

845
00:48:42,000 --> 00:48:42,960
Stop!

846
00:48:43,000 --> 00:48:45,800
Help. Stop!

847
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:47,960
Jesus lady...

848
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:51,960
Help my, please, my son...
took my car and run of, I think he is in Banton.

849
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,960
Will you take me there?
I've got to find him.

850
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:55,960
Look I' sorry,
but I'm not going that way.

851
00:48:56,000 --> 00:48:58,960
I'll pay you... 53 dolars...
It's all I have just take me to Banton.

852
00:48:59,000 --> 00:49:00,400
Help my find my son, please.

853
00:49:00,440 --> 00:49:02,960
You need money.
She shows up.

854
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:06,119
Coincidence?

855
00:49:07,000 --> 00:49:09,960
- All right, hop in. I'll take you.
- Thank you

856
00:49:10,000 --> 00:49:11,960
Well, I'll hop out.

857
00:49:12,000 --> 00:49:14,800
You're geting in tune with the highway.

858
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:16,840
Say,

859
00:49:16,880 --> 00:49:19,519
that's important.

860
00:49:25,000 --> 00:49:26,960
Good luck Neal.

861
00:49:27,000 --> 00:49:28,960
Hey, wait a minute. Am I gonna see you again?

862
00:49:29,000 --> 00:49:30,960
Always wanting an answer.

863
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:34,679
Well, maybe you'll find it in Banton.

864
00:49:41,000 --> 00:49:44,960
I'll pay you the rest,
when we'll find Filip.

865
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:46,960
Oh, I'm Susan Ross.

866
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:49,719
Neal Oliver.

867
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:53,159
- So, how old is Filip, Susan?
- 16.

868
00:49:54,000 --> 00:49:55,960
He's my baby.

869
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,960
He's all I have.

870
00:49:58,000 --> 00:50:02,000
He's run away before,
but he's always come back.

871
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:02,960
God I am so scared...

872
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,960
What if I never find him?

873
00:50:05,000 --> 00:50:08,960
- Well, did you call the Police?
- They say I should look in Banton

874
00:50:09,000 --> 00:50:11,960
It's not like I've been a bad mother.

875
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,960
it's just...
so hard when you're all alone.

876
00:50:16,000 --> 00:50:17,960
We're gonna find him Susan.

877
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:20,639
We'll find him.

878
00:50:29,000 --> 00:50:32,960
<i>It is illegal to sell,</i>
{Y:I}consume, or transport Euphoria,

879
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:35,960
{Y:I}beyond the city limits, under penalty of law.

880
00:50:36,000 --> 00:50:37,960
{Y:I}Be warn, it is highly addictive.

881
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:39,960
{Y:I}Even in small doses.

882
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,960
{Y:I}Withdraw from Euphoria, has known to cause injury and death.

883
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:51,960
{Y:I}All responsible citizens, are urged to avoid this drug at all costs,
and stay in the Euphoria-free zones.

884
00:50:53,000 --> 00:50:58,960
{Y:I}Euphoria is legal in Banton,
and is distributed within the Banton city limits.

885
00:50:59,000 --> 00:51:01,960
<i>- However it is illegal...</i>
- What town is this?

886
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,960
Maybe we should talk to the Police?

887
00:51:08,000 --> 00:51:08,960
{Y:I}Come on.

888
00:51:09,000 --> 00:51:13,960
16-year-old,
in town with legal drugs, and a rage.

889
00:51:14,000 --> 00:51:17,800
Sorry,
but I don't think he'll be at the library.

890
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:47,199
{Y:I}The next bus to the rave is leaving in five minutes.
The next bus to the rave is leaving in five minutes.

891
00:52:22,000 --> 00:52:24,800
First timers?

892
00:52:25,000 --> 00:52:27,960
Are you aware,
that Euphoria is being distributed inside,

893
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:32,960
that it is dangerous, and addictive substance,
and it is strongly advised not to part take of it?

894
00:52:33,000 --> 00:52:34,960
Well, how can we not be?

895
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:37,599
Go on.

896
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:16,960
You'll need this.

897
00:53:17,000 --> 00:53:18,960
No, thanks.

898
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,920
Don't be stupid.

899
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:22,960
This is the answer.

900
00:53:23,000 --> 00:53:24,960
This is to everything.

901
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:27,960
And you really need it.

902
00:53:28,000 --> 00:53:29,960
Susan!

903
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:32,639
He's over here.

904
00:53:34,000 --> 00:53:34,960
Filip.

905
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,960
Oh, thank God,
we've found you.

906
00:53:37,000 --> 00:53:37,960
Please, let's go home.

907
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:39,960
Chill ma, I am home.

908
00:53:40,000 --> 00:53:42,960
See this? This is the place.
The happiest place on earth.

909
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:44,960
You can't stay here.
You have to come home.

910
00:53:45,000 --> 00:53:45,960
Fuck off.

911
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:46,960
Who's this?

912
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:48,960
New stud boyfriend?

913
00:53:49,000 --> 00:53:50,400
Sure can digg him.

914
00:53:50,440 --> 00:53:51,960
- You've got school.
- Fuck school.

915
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:53,960
I've got Euphoria.

916
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:55,960
Here, try some mom, the best.

917
00:53:56,000 --> 00:53:57,960
Filip.
You can't stay here.

918
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:00,280
Yo, I'm in legal age here.

919
00:54:00,320 --> 00:54:02,960
I can do anything I want.
I want... Euphoria.

920
00:54:03,000 --> 00:54:04,599
You stole my car.

921
00:54:04,639 --> 00:54:05,960
It's in the yard. Take it.

922
00:54:06,000 --> 00:54:07,960
I don't want it.
Eat it.

923
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,960
No, you take me there.

924
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:11,960
Go away. Leave me alone

925
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:13,559
Hey, what's a matter with you?

926
00:54:13,599 --> 00:54:16,000
What's going on her?
Hey now brake it out.

927
00:54:16,039 --> 00:54:16,960
Filip come home.

928
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,800
- That's it.
- Filip! Filip! Please come home.

929
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:23,960
The fact is ma'am, here your son's legal age.

930
00:54:24,000 --> 00:54:27,960
He wants to stay...
He can't be forced to leave.

931
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:29,960
And...

932
00:54:30,000 --> 00:54:32,920
He wants to stay.

933
00:54:33,000 --> 00:54:34,960
No, thay all do.
Thay're addicts.

934
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:37,960
But he's just a boy.
He didn't know what he was doing.

935
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:38,960
Oh, no no.

936
00:54:39,000 --> 00:54:39,960
He knew.

937
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:43,360
They all knew,
that's why there are all those wornings posted all over town.

938
00:54:43,400 --> 00:54:45,960
Yeah, but if this drug is so addictive,
why is it legal?

939
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:47,960
Son...

940
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:49,960
This town had siriuse drug problem.

941
00:54:50,000 --> 00:54:51,960
And all the problems that go along with it.

942
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:52,960
We tried everything.

943
00:54:53,000 --> 00:54:56,960
Punishment for dealing, punishment for using.
More inforcement,

944
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:00,960
tougher inforcement, jail,
hell, public humiliation.

945
00:55:01,000 --> 00:55:03,960
But, it all came down to one thind.

946
00:55:04,000 --> 00:55:06,960
Some folks...
just wanna get high.

947
00:55:07,000 --> 00:55:07,960
So...

948
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:10,960
We came up with a radical solution...

949
00:55:11,000 --> 00:55:12,960
Euphoria.

950
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:16,960
Syntatic drug, potent legal,
and totally addictive,

951
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:18,960
and we warn everyone, not to use it.

952
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:22,960
But like I said,
some folks just wanna get high.

953
00:55:23,000 --> 00:55:24,960
One hit of this, and you are hooked.

954
00:55:25,000 --> 00:55:26,960
And we own them.

955
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:31,960
Camp controls the suplies
so of course we can set the prize, and we made it very affordable.

956
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,960
Live in our camps, eat our food, and still couple off jobs,

957
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:38,960
pick up spome trash, mow tha lawn,
force some toilets, and you get your Euphoria.

958
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,719
And at night, man... party till you drop.

959
00:55:43,000 --> 00:55:47,760
Patrol so intense,
that everybody payes the price.

960
00:55:48,000 --> 00:55:49,960
It's an incredible achievemet, really.

961
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:52,960
Drug so powerfull, that it supresses the sex drive.

962
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:54,960
You know, how many rapes we had here last year?

963
00:55:55,000 --> 00:55:56,960
None.

964
00:55:57,000 --> 00:56:01,960
Are you saying Filip
is going to cleanning toiletes for the rest of his life?

965
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:03,960
With no sex deive?

966
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,960
He'll never marry.

967
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:07,960
I'll never have grandhildren?

968
00:56:08,000 --> 00:56:09,960
It's ironick, isn't it?

969
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:11,960
Americans fought a war for freedom...

970
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:13,960
another one to end slavery.

971
00:56:14,000 --> 00:56:15,960
What a Salomon choose to do with thair freedom?

972
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,960
Become slaves.

973
00:56:19,000 --> 00:56:21,960
But they're humen beings.
They have rights.

974
00:56:22,000 --> 00:56:23,960
They didn't know what thay be given up.

975
00:56:24,000 --> 00:56:26,960
Thay made a choice.

976
00:56:27,000 --> 00:56:28,960
But look at them.

977
00:56:29,000 --> 00:56:30,960
They seam miserable to you.

978
00:56:31,000 --> 00:56:32,960
They live a simple, happy life.

979
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:35,960
No decisions... no responsibilities...

980
00:56:36,000 --> 00:56:37,960
No problems...

981
00:56:38,000 --> 00:56:40,960
They found their answer.

982
00:56:41,000 --> 00:56:43,960
You so shure,
that your life is better than thairs?

983
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:45,960
It's like thay're animals.

984
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:47,960
Oh yeah, we're all animals.

985
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:52,480
Just that, some of us have different priorites.
That's all.

986
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:07,840
Whatever your priorities are,
Banton is a really nice place to live.

987
00:57:09,599 --> 00:57:12,960
No, it's a nightmare.
Prease, I want my son back.

988
00:57:13,000 --> 00:57:13,960
I'll do anything.

989
00:57:14,000 --> 00:57:15,960
All right than.
It comes down to three choices.

990
00:57:16,000 --> 00:57:17,960
One.
You move here to the Euphoria free zone,

991
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:19,960
and that way,
you at least have the chance to see him.

992
00:57:20,000 --> 00:57:22,960
Hell, some parents
end up having their children work for them.

993
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,960
Kind of reverse pay back.

994
00:57:25,000 --> 00:57:26,960
Two. You go home.

995
00:57:27,000 --> 00:57:30,960
Try to find something else
to make your life worth a while.

996
00:57:31,000 --> 00:57:33,920
Or three...

997
00:57:34,000 --> 00:57:37,559
Join the party.

998
00:57:41,000 --> 00:57:42,960
What should I do?

999
00:57:43,000 --> 00:57:47,000
You're smart... tell me what to do.

1000
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:48,960
I don't know.

1001
00:57:49,000 --> 00:57:51,960
I guess, if it was me...

1002
00:57:52,000 --> 00:57:53,960
I'd want to see my boy.

1003
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:56,000
But he doesn't want to see me.

1004
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,960
Oh, my God...

1005
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,800
It's wonredful...

1006
00:58:20,000 --> 00:58:23,440
I... feel so... beautiful...

1007
00:58:27,000 --> 00:58:31,079
I never knew, I can be so...

1008
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:33,239
happy.

1009
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:42,000
Well, how about you son?
