1
00:00:27,318 --> 00:00:29,446
<i>I was there when everything changed.</i>

2
00:00:30,530 --> 00:00:31,906
<i>Forty years ago.</i>

3
00:00:40,081 --> 00:00:45,879
<i>It was our third world war,
and humanity was determined to end itself.</i>

4
00:00:56,598 --> 00:00:59,309
<i>Then, on the edge of annihilation,</i>

5
00:00:59,392 --> 00:01:01,019
<i>an alien saved us.</i>

6
00:01:05,899 --> 00:01:08,026
<i>He smashed our tools of war.</i>

7
00:01:18,495 --> 00:01:20,622
<i>He forced us to stop fighting,</i>

8
00:01:20,705 --> 00:01:25,835
<i>and shut down World War III
in one fucking day.</i>

9
00:01:29,923 --> 00:01:31,299
<i>We called him</i>

10
00:01:32,258 --> 00:01:33,802
<i>Marvelous Man.</i>

11
00:02:08,169 --> 00:02:10,255
<i>For the first time in history,</i>

12
00:02:10,338 --> 00:02:12,841
<i>world peace appeared possible.</i>

13
00:02:55,884 --> 00:02:57,385
- <i>Good evening, America.</i>
- Mom?

14
00:02:57,468 --> 00:03:02,182
<i>I'm award-winning journalist Van Dawson,
and this is </i>Van Dawson Tonight.

15
00:03:02,974 --> 00:03:07,187
<i>We eagerly await
the 40th anniversary of Marvelous Man Day.</i>

16
00:03:07,270 --> 00:03:11,399
<i>The day Marvelous Man
appeared from the sky</i>

17
00:03:11,482 --> 00:03:14,611
<i>to single-handedly end World War III.</i>

18
00:03:23,244 --> 00:03:24,662
<i>Will our first superhero</i>

19
00:03:24,746 --> 00:03:28,708
<i>continue to remain staunchly neutral
in human conflicts?</i>

20
00:03:28,791 --> 00:03:33,463
<i>Will he act against
the expansionist hive mind Anubis?</i>

21
00:03:33,546 --> 00:03:38,718
<i>Will he condemn President Nick Nukem's
aggressive military rhetoric?</i>

22
00:03:41,554 --> 00:03:43,681
<i>We now go live to the Citadel of Justice,</i>

23
00:03:43,765 --> 00:03:47,852
<i>where Marvelous Man is moments away
from giving his yearly M Day address.</i>

24
00:03:48,436 --> 00:03:51,397
<i>M Day!</i>

25
00:04:09,958 --> 00:04:13,378
<i>M Day!</i>

26
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,556
People of Earth...

27
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,228
this is Marvelous Man.

28
00:04:30,853 --> 00:04:32,438
Come on! Come on! Check this out!

29
00:04:32,522 --> 00:04:35,566
Look at that. That's my hero!

30
00:04:40,822 --> 00:04:44,867
<i>For four decades,
I have protected you.</i>

31
00:04:46,494 --> 00:04:47,954
<i>I saved you.</i>

32
00:05:00,550 --> 00:05:01,718
Boom!

33
00:05:06,806 --> 00:05:08,266
<i>I don't feel anything.</i>

34
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:11,853
<i>I'm a prisoner in this bulletproof skin.</i>

35
00:05:12,353 --> 00:05:15,106
Why does Marvelous Man look so sad, Mom?

36
00:05:19,444 --> 00:05:21,195
And when I close my eyes,

37
00:05:22,864 --> 00:05:24,198
this is what I hear.

38
00:05:29,954 --> 00:05:32,040
<i>Please, help me!</i>

39
00:05:32,123 --> 00:05:34,500
<i>Why? Why didn't you save us?</i>

40
00:05:36,711 --> 00:05:38,911
<i>- Why didn't you save us?
- Where are you?</i>

41
00:05:39,339 --> 00:05:43,259
<i>- You're supposed to be our savior!
- Where are you? Where are you?</i>

42
00:05:44,594 --> 00:05:46,429
<i>- Where are you?
- Our savior!</i>

43
00:05:50,224 --> 00:05:51,601
<i>If I sleep,</i>

44
00:05:53,186 --> 00:05:54,270
people die.

45
00:05:54,854 --> 00:05:57,440
Real inspiring speech, Cal.

46
00:06:03,946 --> 00:06:04,946
Wait, is...

47
00:06:06,115 --> 00:06:07,115
is that caltronite?

48
00:06:16,542 --> 00:06:17,542
No!

49
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:23,423
What?

50
00:06:24,467 --> 00:06:25,676
I'm tired of hiding.

51
00:06:28,137 --> 00:06:29,263
<i>I'm tired.</i>

52
00:06:30,973 --> 00:06:32,308
<i>So I've found my escape.</i>

53
00:06:32,392 --> 00:06:34,018
No. Don't do this, Cal!

54
00:06:34,102 --> 00:06:35,228
I found it.

55
00:06:47,407 --> 00:06:48,950
- No!
<i>- </i>What happened?

56
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:51,369
Mom!

57
00:07:02,380 --> 00:07:03,899
- Cecilia?
- Yeah?

58
00:07:03,923 --> 00:07:04,757
<i>Are we live?</i>

59
00:07:04,841 --> 00:07:06,300
Marvelous Man is dead.

60
00:07:07,135 --> 00:07:08,719
<i>Um...</i>

61
00:07:10,721 --> 00:07:11,764
Clear my schedule.

62
00:07:19,647 --> 00:07:21,274
<i>What we have just witnessed</i>

63
00:07:22,483 --> 00:07:25,820
<i>is obviously a dark day for mankind.</i>

64
00:07:28,156 --> 00:07:30,241
<i>There are no words to properly express</i>

65
00:07:31,159 --> 00:07:32,285
<i>what just happened</i>

66
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:34,620
<i>and what we have lost</i>

67
00:07:36,247 --> 00:07:37,247
<i>as a nation,</i>

68
00:07:38,916 --> 00:07:40,042
<i>as a species,</i>

69
00:07:41,711 --> 00:07:42,711
<i>as a planet.</i>

70
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:03,399
<i>Fatality.</i>

71
00:08:04,525 --> 00:08:07,111
<i>The Guardians of Justice will save you.</i>

<i>My fellow Americans,</i>

76
00:08:36,015 --> 00:08:39,227
<i>an immigrant from another planet
came to our shores</i>

77
00:08:39,310 --> 00:08:41,771
<i>and made not only a life for himself,</i>

78
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:44,941
<i>but created a lasting legacy as well.</i>

79
00:08:46,025 --> 00:08:47,693
<i>In the wake of his death,</i>

80
00:08:48,319 --> 00:08:52,782
<i>America will continue
to protect the legacy of Marvelous Man.</i>

81
00:08:53,699 --> 00:08:56,786
<i>We will prevent
the escalation of nuclear conflict.</i>

82
00:08:57,537 --> 00:09:03,000
<i>We will curtail the homosexual epidemic
that is gripping our great nation.</i>

83
00:09:03,084 --> 00:09:04,084
Asshole!

84
00:09:04,126 --> 00:09:08,089
<i>And I promise you
that even with Marvelous Man gone,</i>

85
00:09:08,673 --> 00:09:12,009
<i>our enemies will continue to fear us.</i>

86
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:16,389
<i>God bless you, and God bless America.</i>

87
00:09:19,767 --> 00:09:21,394
We're fucked, people!

88
00:09:21,477 --> 00:09:23,187
Aw, Phil.

89
00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:27,483
Now that Marvelous Man is gone,
who is going to save us?

90
00:09:27,567 --> 00:09:31,571
<i>People on the streets are going crazy.
It's as if the whole world has...</i>

91
00:09:32,071 --> 00:09:34,532
<i>has lost all hope.</i>

92
00:09:36,659 --> 00:09:38,119
<i>The year is 1960.</i>

93
00:09:38,202 --> 00:09:40,830
<i>Marvelous Man has brought
rapid technological advancement,</i>

94
00:09:40,913 --> 00:09:44,208
<i>causing social turmoil and an escalation
of street-level violence.</i>

95
00:09:57,972 --> 00:10:01,434
<i>In this asphalt jungle,
we join a lone vigilante, the Knight Hawk,</i>

96
00:10:01,517 --> 00:10:05,646
<i>conducting a crusade against
costumed crime kingpin The Demander.</i>

97
00:10:46,437 --> 00:10:49,607
<i>In this moment of peril,
a god aligned himself with a man.</i>

98
00:10:59,575 --> 00:11:01,285
<i>Together, they would forge a friendship</i>

99
00:11:01,369 --> 00:11:04,664
<i>that became the cornerstone
of the Guardians of Justice.</i>

100
00:11:09,835 --> 00:11:11,212
<i>For our next segment,</i>

101
00:11:11,295 --> 00:11:15,466
<i>an exclusive interview with the former
CIA operative who stole a god's heart.</i>

102
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:19,512
<i>America's princess, now America's widow,</i>

103
00:11:19,595 --> 00:11:20,596
<i>Laura Louis.</i>

104
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:23,182
And we're live in three, two...

105
00:11:25,518 --> 00:11:27,978
Ms. Louis, you have my condolences.

106
00:11:29,063 --> 00:11:31,315
<i>The world shares your grief.</i>

107
00:11:31,399 --> 00:11:33,818
<i>How are you processing
what your husband has done?</i>

108
00:11:33,901 --> 00:11:35,277
<i>He wouldn't do that.</i>

109
00:11:35,361 --> 00:11:38,155
<i>He wouldn't do that to the world,
to the Guardians,</i>

110
00:11:38,239 --> 00:11:39,448
<i>to me.</i>

111
00:11:39,532 --> 00:11:43,994
<i>I think there can be no question
Marvelous Man committed suicide.</i>

112
00:11:44,078 --> 00:11:45,998
<i>You don't know
what you're talking about.</i>

113
00:11:46,038 --> 00:11:50,042
<i>I've been watching it and re-watching it
over and over and over again.</i>

114
00:11:51,794 --> 00:11:52,962
<i>He was murdered.</i>

115
00:11:56,257 --> 00:11:57,383
<i>Murdered?</i>

116
00:11:57,466 --> 00:11:58,694
<i>Shocking revelations
from Marvelous Man's widow.</i>

117
00:11:58,718 --> 00:12:00,928
<i>Was Marvelous Man murdered?</i>

118
00:12:01,011 --> 00:12:03,031
<i>We will investigate
the allegations tonight at ten...</i>

119
00:12:03,055 --> 00:12:04,533
<i>Suicide or murder?</i>

120
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,536
<i>The world demands answers. The last 24
hours have shaken our planet to its core.</i>

121
00:12:10,396 --> 00:12:13,441
<i>If you're right, then there's one question
the world needs answered.</i>

122
00:12:13,524 --> 00:12:16,861
<i>Who, if anyone, killed Marvelous Man?</i>

123
00:12:17,862 --> 00:12:19,947
<i>We need to hear
from the Guardians of Justice,</i>

124
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,284
<i>and specifically
from Marvelous Man's second-in-command.</i>

125
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:27,830
Knight Hawk, where are you?

126
00:12:36,380 --> 00:12:39,884
Computer,
call the Guardians.

127
00:12:41,969 --> 00:12:43,053
<i>King Tsunami here.</i>

128
00:12:43,888 --> 00:12:44,888
<i>Speed here.</i>

129
00:12:45,890 --> 00:12:47,141
<i>Golden Goddess.</i>

130
00:12:47,641 --> 00:12:49,393
<i>Mm. Awsome Man present.</i>

131
00:12:50,186 --> 00:12:51,353
<i>Sorry. I'm eating a taco.</i>

132
00:12:51,854 --> 00:12:53,022
<i>Blue-Scream online.</i>

133
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:54,398
<i>Black Bow here.</i>

134
00:12:54,982 --> 00:12:58,611
<i>With Marvelous Man gone,
it's time to suit up,</i>

135
00:12:58,694 --> 00:13:03,282
<i>assume control of the Guardians,
and protect the planet.</i>

136
00:13:04,658 --> 00:13:06,076
<i>Golden Goddess!</i>

137
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:08,662
<i>She's the princess
of the god realm.</i>

138
00:13:08,746 --> 00:13:10,331
<i>The Speed!</i>

139
00:13:10,414 --> 00:13:13,417
<i>The only person
faster than Marvelous Man.</i>

140
00:13:14,376 --> 00:13:15,628
<i>Black Bow!</i>

141
00:13:15,711 --> 00:13:17,630
<i>Expert marksman</i>

142
00:13:17,713 --> 00:13:19,256
<i>and reality star.</i>

143
00:13:20,049 --> 00:13:21,425
<i>Blue-Scream!</i>

144
00:13:21,509 --> 00:13:24,512
<i>Whose sonic scream
contains immense power.</i>

145
00:13:25,429 --> 00:13:27,014
<i>King Tsunami!</i>

146
00:13:27,515 --> 00:13:29,391
<i>Overlord of the oceans.</i>

147
00:13:30,267 --> 00:13:31,769
<i>Awsome Man!</i>

148
00:13:31,852 --> 00:13:36,649
<i>Who possesses a magic word
that gives him the power of seven gods.</i>

149
00:13:37,233 --> 00:13:40,820
<i>Together, we form
the Guardians of Justice.</i>

150
00:13:43,072 --> 00:13:44,698
With Marvelous Man gone,

151
00:13:44,782 --> 00:13:47,576
there's a power vacuum
that could rip this world apart.

152
00:13:48,077 --> 00:13:49,912
We can't have that happen.

153
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:54,083
<i>Yeah. How are we gonna do that? All of us
combined are not equal to Marvelous Man.</i>

154
00:13:54,166 --> 00:13:55,584
<i>Speak for yourself, human.</i>

155
00:13:55,668 --> 00:13:56,710
<i>Oh, come on. Don't fight.</i>

156
00:13:56,794 --> 00:13:57,878
<i>You're a fucking fish.</i>

157
00:13:57,962 --> 00:14:01,590
<i>What can you do? You can talk to fish.
"Oh, wow! I'm so fucking powerful!"</i>

158
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:04,635
<i>Pathetic street whore.
I'm a king, and I demand respect!</i>

159
00:14:04,718 --> 00:14:05,718
Enough!

160
00:14:06,428 --> 00:14:09,974
You're supposed to be role models. Heroes.

161
00:14:10,474 --> 00:14:11,809
Try and act like it.

162
00:14:12,852 --> 00:14:14,520
Blue-Scream's right.

163
00:14:14,603 --> 00:14:17,439
None of us compare to Marvelous Man.

164
00:14:18,858 --> 00:14:23,320
But if we work together as a team,

165
00:14:23,404 --> 00:14:25,155
we could save this world.

166
00:14:25,239 --> 00:14:28,158
We can honor our fallen Guardian.

167
00:14:28,784 --> 00:14:30,619
We could strive to be

168
00:14:31,954 --> 00:14:33,289
marvelous.

169
00:14:34,081 --> 00:14:38,168
Everyone knows Marvelous Man
didn't just protect a city or a town.

170
00:14:38,711 --> 00:14:40,421
He protected the world.

171
00:14:41,005 --> 00:14:42,965
Now that's on us.

172
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:46,176
Awsome Man, Speed, Golden Goddess,

173
00:14:46,260 --> 00:14:49,513
you're the only ones fast enough
to handle an international crisis.

174
00:14:49,597 --> 00:14:53,809
There's a squad of cyborg T-Rexes
on the loose in Syria.

175
00:14:57,187 --> 00:15:00,190
Take them down and bring them to justice.

176
00:15:00,274 --> 00:15:02,067
<i>Consider it done.</i>

177
00:15:02,151 --> 00:15:05,154
A massive mudslide
has thousands trapped and dying.

178
00:15:05,237 --> 00:15:08,866
Awsome Man, the Red Cross
needs you in Thailand.

179
00:15:08,949 --> 00:15:11,118
The Hawk drones
will back you up with supplies.

180
00:15:11,201 --> 00:15:12,328
<i>Activate.</i>

181
00:15:14,038 --> 00:15:15,080
<i>You can count on me.</i>

182
00:15:15,581 --> 00:15:19,418
Speed, I need you
to pick up Blue-Scream and drop him in LA.

183
00:15:19,501 --> 00:15:24,465
A new street drug called "Mellow Devil"
is causing people to lose their minds.

184
00:15:25,257 --> 00:15:27,635
- We've got to extinguish the fires.
<i>- You got it.</i>

185
00:15:27,718 --> 00:15:30,387
<i>He can't do that alone.
I should go with him.</i>

186
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:33,515
<i>- I'll be fine. Speed, let's go.
- I'm on my way.</i>

187
00:15:33,599 --> 00:15:34,642
Wait, Speed!

188
00:15:34,725 --> 00:15:38,020
After you've dropped Scream in LA,
I need you to get back here,

189
00:15:38,103 --> 00:15:40,314
because we've gotta get
Black Bow to Peru.

190
00:15:40,397 --> 00:15:42,733
<i>Wait, wait, wait. What am I,
the Guardians' delivery boy?</i>

191
00:15:42,816 --> 00:15:46,070
You're whatever the Guardians
need you to be. Now, move!

192
00:15:46,862 --> 00:15:47,862
<i>And me?</i>

193
00:15:50,199 --> 00:15:53,077
The Scottish Skull
has hijacked an American submarine

194
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,828
off the coast of New Zeamar.

195
00:16:00,125 --> 00:16:03,462
Walker! How did you break this feed?

196
00:16:03,545 --> 00:16:05,589
<i>Despite what you'd like
to believe, Atticus,</i>

197
00:16:05,673 --> 00:16:07,633
<i>there are people smarter than you.</i>

198
00:16:09,093 --> 00:16:10,761
<i>Addison Walker.</i>

199
00:16:10,844 --> 00:16:15,057
<i>She runs a private military group
funded by a few dozen corporations.</i>

200
00:16:15,140 --> 00:16:19,520
<i>Her objective? Maintain global
economic stability at all cost.</i>

201
00:16:21,105 --> 00:16:25,150
<i>She's playing chess
and only she gets to see the board.</i>

202
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:27,903
What do you want?

203
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:30,948
<i>As you know,
Marvelous Man was leading negotiations</i>

204
00:16:31,031 --> 00:16:33,826
<i>for a worldwide nuclear disarmament.</i>

205
00:16:33,909 --> 00:16:37,329
<i>Since his death, those negotiations
have spun out of control.</i>

206
00:16:37,413 --> 00:16:39,289
That sounds
like your problem,

207
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,541
not mine.

208
00:16:43,669 --> 00:16:45,796
<i>Oh. It's going to become
everyone's problem soon.</i>

209
00:16:45,879 --> 00:16:49,508
<i>Because of the questions
surrounding Marvelous Man's death,</i>

210
00:16:50,384 --> 00:16:53,679
<i>every country is pointing the finger
at one another.</i>

211
00:16:53,762 --> 00:16:56,640
<i>China is saying Russia had him killed.</i>

212
00:16:56,724 --> 00:17:00,394
<i>Iran and Iraq are sure
the job was done by the Americans.</i>

213
00:17:00,978 --> 00:17:02,646
That doesn't even make sense.

214
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:06,233
<i>The steps that lead us to war rarely do.</i>

215
00:17:06,775 --> 00:17:09,945
<i>The only way this ends
without an all-out nuclear holocaust</i>

216
00:17:10,029 --> 00:17:14,742
<i>is if you find out
who really killed Marvelous Man.</i>

217
00:17:15,242 --> 00:17:17,202
So you don't think
it was a suicide?

218
00:17:17,286 --> 00:17:18,495
<i>I don't.</i>

219
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:21,206
<i>But from what I hear, neither do you.</i>

220
00:17:21,790 --> 00:17:23,167
I don't have an opinion.

221
00:17:23,834 --> 00:17:27,004
And I won't have an opinion
until my investigation is completed.

222
00:17:27,087 --> 00:17:31,175
<i>Yes, but I know the problem
is you're looking in the wrong place.</i>

223
00:17:32,009 --> 00:17:33,969
Are you fucking with me or what?

224
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:36,221
<i>You need to look
at the Guardians themselves.</i>

225
00:17:36,305 --> 00:17:39,099
The Guardians?
What do you know that I don't?

226
00:17:39,183 --> 00:17:41,602
<i>Time is running short.
Find the answer.</i>

227
00:17:41,685 --> 00:17:45,439
<i>Or I'll arrest you
and every one of your super friends</i>

228
00:17:45,522 --> 00:17:47,483
<i>before declaring martial law</i>

229
00:17:48,067 --> 00:17:49,193
<i>on the world.</i>

230
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,204
Knight Hawk to Guardians.

231
00:18:00,287 --> 00:18:01,622
Complete your mission

232
00:18:02,664 --> 00:18:04,917
and report to the Hawk's Nest.

233
00:18:05,501 --> 00:18:08,420
<i>♪ We do not need forever ♪</i>

234
00:18:08,504 --> 00:18:10,964
<i>♪ Honey, we've got now ♪</i>

235
00:18:11,048 --> 00:18:12,925
<i>♪ Tell me God is dead ♪</i>

236
00:18:13,008 --> 00:18:18,680
<i>♪ I'm safe, let's go to bed

237
00:18:18,764 --> 00:18:21,141
<i>♪ Wake me when you're gone... ♪</i>

238
00:18:25,604 --> 00:18:27,397
Jesus Christ!

239
00:18:28,273 --> 00:18:29,650
That's fucked up, man.

240
00:18:29,733 --> 00:18:31,860
I know. I know. But think about it.

241
00:18:32,653 --> 00:18:34,780
Marvelous Man is dead. Right? Huh?

242
00:18:35,405 --> 00:18:38,617
So, you think if we wore his skin,

243
00:18:39,868 --> 00:18:41,120
we'd be bulletproof?

244
00:18:41,203 --> 00:18:44,164
I mean, I guess. I-it's like
a bulletproof jacket. You know?

245
00:18:44,248 --> 00:18:46,375
It... it still goes through.
It hurts like shit.

246
00:18:46,458 --> 00:18:49,711
No, it doesn't!
At least, I think it doesn't.

247
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:50,796
Shit. I mean...

248
00:18:50,879 --> 00:18:54,883
'Cause his whole body is bulletproof.
It's impenetrable, man. All right?

249
00:18:54,967 --> 00:18:58,804
If you wore his skin, you'd still be
a doughboy with shit muscles.

250
00:18:58,887 --> 00:19:01,849
Oh, fuck you. Fuck you.
You know how much I've been lifting.

251
00:19:01,932 --> 00:19:04,285
Yeah, yeah.
You're lifting beer and donuts, man.

252
00:19:04,309 --> 00:19:06,562
- That still counts.
- Yeah. In your world.

253
00:19:07,604 --> 00:19:08,884
What's the count at?

254
00:19:08,939 --> 00:19:11,024
Three and a half.
Look at this one.

255
00:19:11,108 --> 00:19:12,988
- Smiley face?
- Uh-huh.

256
00:19:13,485 --> 00:19:15,487
- Shit.
- Oh, well...

257
00:19:16,029 --> 00:19:17,656
Another smiley face.

258
00:19:18,365 --> 00:19:20,951
Oh, okay.
Look at this one here.

259
00:19:21,034 --> 00:19:22,619
Fucking ground beef.

260
00:19:22,703 --> 00:19:24,454
How's that wife of yours, man?

261
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:27,124
She's good.
She's a little stressed out.

262
00:19:27,207 --> 00:19:28,792
Kid had an accident. You know?

263
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:31,354
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

264
00:19:31,378 --> 00:19:33,258
Hey, when it rains, it pours.

265
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:36,550
Tell me about it.
I'm missing that single life though.

266
00:19:36,633 --> 00:19:39,261
Yeah. Look at this one here.
The eyeball's out.

267
00:19:39,344 --> 00:19:40,344
Oh.

268
00:19:40,846 --> 00:19:42,566
Single life?
You are missing it.

269
00:19:42,598 --> 00:19:44,641
- Hey, I forgot to ask you...
- What?

270
00:19:44,725 --> 00:19:46,786
- Another smiley face.
- Yeah.

271
00:19:46,810 --> 00:19:49,250
How was that...
how was that date the other night?

272
00:19:49,313 --> 00:19:51,982
What date? Oh, yeah!
The one with the big old...?

273
00:19:52,065 --> 00:19:53,692
Yeah, the tig old bitties.

274
00:19:53,775 --> 00:19:57,738
Oh, man, she was... Crazy, but she was nice.

275
00:19:57,821 --> 00:20:00,324
Yeah.
I fucking love titties, man.

276
00:20:00,407 --> 00:20:01,909
I know you do.

277
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,494
Oh. Look at this. Oh sh...

278
00:20:04,995 --> 00:20:07,497
- Stinks!
- That smells like shit, man.

279
00:20:07,581 --> 00:20:10,250
- Oh, man!
- Fucking maggots and shit.

280
00:20:10,334 --> 00:20:11,501
Oh, yeah.

281
00:20:13,795 --> 00:20:15,797
Oh. Look at this one.

282
00:20:16,715 --> 00:20:18,133
Shit.

283
00:20:18,926 --> 00:20:20,806
Got a splitting headache,
I guess. I don't know.

284
00:20:20,886 --> 00:20:22,054
That's disgusting.

285
00:20:22,137 --> 00:20:23,597
Check this one out here.

286
00:20:23,680 --> 00:20:27,726
- That's not right, man.
- Oh, man. Faceless.
