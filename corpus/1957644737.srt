00:08:54,967 --> 00:08:56,102

183
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:57,970

NO, SIR.

204
00:10:31,363 --> 00:10:33,466
TAKE THEM TO THE WARDROOM SO THEY CAN DRY OFF, SEE TO IT

THANK YOU, SIR.

207
00:10:36,168 --> 00:10:37,303

FOUR MEN, ONE WOMAN, SIR.

212
00:10:46,479 --> 00:10:48,814
IF THERE'S A WOMAN, SHE SHOULD HAVE SECURE QUARTERS.

213
00:10:48,848 --> 00:10:49,815
I'LL SEE TO IT.

214
00:10:49,849 --> 00:10:52,084
THE X.O. HAS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE SURVIVORS.

215
00:10:52,118 --> 00:10:53,219
HE'LL SEE TO IT.

218
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,091
I DIDN'T NOTICE.

219
00:10:59,125 --> 00:11:02,261
MR. MURPHY, YOU HAVE THE CONN.

220
00:11:02,294 --> 00:11:04,530
HE DIDN'T NOTICE.

221
00:11:04,563 --> 00:11:07,099
CHRIST, HIS ASS IS SO TIGHT, A DIME COULDN'T DROP OUT OF

00:11:17,109 --> 00:11:19,912
FOR YOU, MA'AM.

225
00:11:19,945 --> 00:11:22,248
COULD YOU PLEASE TURN YOUR BACK?

226
00:11:22,281 --> 00:11:23,949
YEAH.

227
00:11:30,322 --> 00:11:32,191
HEY, WHAT'S THE MATTER?

228
00:11:32,224 --> 00:11:34,493
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

229
00:11:34,527 --> 00:11:36,595
YOU'RE OKAY.

230
00:11:36,629 --> 00:11:39,632
YOU'RE ON THE BEST BOAT IN THE FLEET.

231
00:11:39,665 --> 00:11:49,909
IT'S OKAY, NOTHING'S GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU.

232
00:11:49,909 --> 00:12:15,201
IT'S OKAY, NOTHING'S GONNA HAPPEN TO YOU.

EXCUSE ME.

237
00:13:20,165 --> 00:13:22,201
CAN I ASK YOU SOMETHING?

238
00:13:22,234 --> 00:13:24,637
YES, MA'AM, ANYTHING.

239
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:26,672
WHAT ROOM IS IT?

240
00:13:26,705 --> 00:13:40,019
OH, THIS IS WHERE WE KEEP THE WEAPONS AND--

241
00:13:40,052 --> 00:13:41,453
GO.

242
00:13:49,261 --> 00:13:51,397
Wager: SIR, WE HAVE A COMMUNICATIONS ERROR.

243
00:13:51,430 --> 00:13:53,098
FIND IT, MR. WAGER.

244
00:14:00,139 --> 00:14:07,579
LIEUTENANT, I THINK YOU SHOULD SEE THIS.

245
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:09,748
THAT'S THE ULYSSES.

246
00:14:09,782 --> 00:14:13,619
RADIO COMMUNICATIONS ARE BLOCKED.

247
00:14:13,652 --> 00:14:15,587
GET ME ADMIRAL PENDELTON.

248
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,123
AND THERE'S NO RESPONSE TO RADIO CALLS?

249
00:14:18,157 --> 00:14:19,258
NONE AT ALL, SIR.

250
00:14:19,291 --> 00:14:21,360
WHAT ASSETS DO WE HAVE IN THE VICINITY?

251
00:14:21,393 --> 00:14:23,429
WE HAVE SEVERAL TARGETS COMBING THE AREA, BUT WE CAN'T

252
00:14:23,462 --> 00:14:24,396
GET A BEARING ON IT.

253
00:14:24,430 --> 00:14:26,632
IT'S POSSIBLE THE HIGH-RANGE DROP BUOY SONAR--

254
00:14:26,665 --> 00:14:29,234
WILL PICK UP EVERY WHALE AND SHARK IN A TEN-MILE RADIUS.

255
00:14:29,268 --> 00:14:31,470
THE SUB PROBABLY HAS A MOVING SIGNATURE.

256
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,205
GET ME JAMES CARTER.

257
00:14:33,238 --> 00:14:34,473
AND GET ME THE PRESIDENT!

258
00:14:34,506 --> 00:14:36,308
RIGHT AWAY, SIR.

259
00:14:44,149 --> 00:14:46,452
WE TAKE ONLY WHAT WE CAN CARRY NOW. WE CAN ALWAYS

260
00:14:46,485 --> 00:14:47,486
COME BACK FOR MORE.

261
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:49,121
LET'S GO.

262
00:15:10,109 --> 00:15:11,844
JAMES ALLEN CARTER?

263
00:15:11,877 --> 00:15:13,479
YEAH.

264
00:15:15,381 --> 00:15:17,783
I'M LIEUTENANT COMMANDER LISA STARK, SPECIAL

265
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:20,185

OH, YEAH, YEAH.

267
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:24,156
WE MET BEFORE.

268
00:15:24,189 --> 00:15:25,824
I DON'T RECALL.

269
00:15:25,858 --> 00:15:28,560
HEH, I THOUGHT YOU'D NEVER FORGET.

270
00:15:28,594 --> 00:15:30,662
WE HAVE A SERIOUS SITUATION ON OUR HANDS.

271
00:15:30,696 --> 00:15:31,797
I WAS HOPING YOU'D SAY THAT.

272
00:15:31,830 --> 00:15:41,807
A SERIOUS MILITARY SITUATION.

273
00:15:41,840 --> 00:15:44,276
ADMIRAL PENDELTON SENT ME.

274
00:15:44,309 --> 00:15:46,578
TOMMY!

275
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,248
THE ULYSSES IS MISSING.

276
00:15:49,281 --> 00:15:50,816
MISSING?

277
00:15:50,849 --> 00:15:53,585

278
00:15:53,619 --> 00:15:56,388
YEAH, THIS IS SPECIAL OFFICER STARK.

279
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:57,423
YOU CAN CALL ME LISA.

280
00:15:57,456 --> 00:15:58,557
HI, SPECIAL STARK.

281
00:15:58,590 --> 00:15:59,825
I'M TOMMY.

282
00:15:59,858 --> 00:16:02,428
TOMMY, GO GET US SOME JACKETS, OKAY?

283
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,629
WE'RE GONNA GO FIND US A SUB.

284
00:16:03,662 --> 00:16:05,230
OKAY.

285
00:16:05,264 --> 00:16:06,765
LET'S GO.

286
00:16:17,609 --> 00:16:20,145
( indistinct chatter )  EXCUSE ME, THIS IS

287
00:16:25,250 --> 00:16:26,785
A RESTRICTED AREA.

288
00:16:26,819 --> 00:16:28,220
ARE YOU CAPTAIN LANGE?

289
00:16:28,253 --> 00:16:29,321
YES, I AM.

290
00:16:29,354 --> 00:16:32,224
I WANT TO THANK YOU IN PERSON.

291
00:16:32,257 --> 00:16:34,359
( overlapping shouts )  DON'T MOVE!

292
00:16:37,529 --> 00:16:38,497
GET YOUR HANDS UP!

293
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:44,203
( guns cocking )  ( imitating Clint Eastwood )

294
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:46,472
WELL, THIS NEW MacDONALD KID'S REALLY A PUNK.

295
00:16:46,505 --> 00:16:49,641
SOMEONE NEEDS TO TAKE HIM OUT AND SLAP HIM AROUND A LITTLE.

296
00:16:49,675 --> 00:16:51,410
HELLO.

297
00:16:51,443 --> 00:16:52,878
HEY.

298
00:16:52,911 --> 00:16:54,746
YOU MAKE FUNNY VOICES?

299
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,349
( imitating Jack Nicholson ) WELL, I'LL DO ANY VOICE

300
00:16:57,382 --> 00:17:00,552
THAT YOU WANT ME TO DO.

301
00:17:00,586 --> 00:17:02,921
MAKE THE QUIET ONE.

302
00:17:08,594 --> 00:17:09,828
MY NAME IS RICHTER.

303
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:11,897
I KNOW CONTROL THIS SUBMARINE.

304
00:17:11,930 --> 00:17:15,501
IF YOU DON'T COOPERATE--  HEY!

305
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:19,238
( gunshots ) OH!

306
00:17:19,271 --> 00:17:21,707
I THINK THAT SAYS IT ALL.

307
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:23,609
SAPRICH, TAKE A LOOK AROUND.

308
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:26,211
IT'S ALL FAMILIAR TO YOU, NO?

309
00:17:27,412 --> 00:17:30,382
YES, JUST LIKE THE PLANS I STUDIED.

310
00:17:30,415 --> 00:17:31,750
WE WILL HAVE NO PROBLEMS HERE.

311
00:17:31,783 --> 00:17:33,719
WE WILL NOT TAKE ORDERS FROM YOU.

312
00:17:33,752 --> 00:17:36,288
YOUR FORMER CAPTAIN HAS BEEN RELIEVED OF HIS DUTIES, SO I AM

313
00:17:36,321 --> 00:17:37,856
YOUR CAPTAIN NOW.

314
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,626
IF THERE ARE ANY PROBLEMS, MR. SAPRICH CAN RELIEVE YOU

315
00:17:40,659 --> 00:17:41,960
OF YOUR DUTIES AS WELL.

316
00:17:41,994 --> 00:17:43,228
BOLANNE?

317
00:17:43,262 --> 00:17:44,396
YES?

318
00:17:44,429 --> 00:17:46,565
GO TO THE MACHINE ROOM AND THE AIR CONDITIONING SYSTEM.

319
00:17:46,598 --> 00:17:48,600
BYPASS THE DUCTS FOR THE RADIO ROOM, THE SONAR ROOM,

320
00:17:48,634 --> 00:17:51,303
AND THIS ROOM, AND FLOOD THE REST WITH GAS.

321
00:17:51,336 --> 00:17:52,471
WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

322
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:55,474
THE REST OF THE CREW WILL SLEEP FOR A WHILE, MR. LANGE.

323
00:17:55,507 --> 00:18:01,747
YOU WON'T BE NEEDING YOUR KEY ANYMORE.

324
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,382
OR YOU, MR. MacDONALD.

325
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:08,020
MOVE!

326
00:18:08,053 --> 00:18:09,721
DOWN, DOWN, DOWN, DOWN!

327
00:18:09,755 --> 00:18:12,024
FIND HIM AND GET THAT KEY BEFORE THE GAS FILLS THE HALLS!

328
00:18:12,057 --> 00:18:13,625
AND GET A MASK!

329
00:18:23,735 --> 00:18:26,538
GET THE FORMER CAPTAIN'S BODY OUT OF MY SIGHT.

330
00:18:26,572 --> 00:18:27,940
YOU! YOU!

331
00:18:27,973 --> 00:18:31,476
MR. NEWTON, GO WITH HIM.

332
00:18:33,378 --> 00:18:43,422
IF THEY TRY ANYTHING, SHOOT THEM.

333
00:18:43,422 --> 00:19:01,974
IF THEY TRY ANYTHING, SHOOT THEM.

334
00:19:02,007 --> 00:19:04,509
( gas hisses ) ( gas hissing )

335
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:35,574
( coughing ) WHAT IS THAT?

336
00:19:43,749 --> 00:19:46,852
( coughing )  Man: MR. CARTER, THIS WAY.

337
00:20:28,827 --> 00:20:29,995
GOOD MORNING.

338
00:20:30,028 --> 00:20:31,129
WHAT'S THE MATTER, ADMIRAL?

339
00:20:31,163 --> 00:20:32,397
LOSE A SUB?

340
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:33,465
YOU BELIEVE IT?

341
00:20:33,498 --> 00:20:34,499
YOU GOT ANY IDEAS?

342
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:36,601
LAST KNOWN POSITION WAS 700 MILES OFF THE COAST,

343
00:20:36,635 --> 00:20:37,769
NEAR THE MID-ATLANTIC RIDGE.

344
00:20:37,803 --> 00:20:39,905
WE THOUGHT YOU COULD IDENTIFY THE UNIQUE MOTION SIGNATURE

345
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:41,106
ON THE DROP BUOY RADAR.

346
00:20:41,139 --> 00:20:42,441
WHOSE IDEA WAS THAT?

347
00:20:42,474 --> 00:20:43,608
MINE.

348
00:20:43,642 --> 00:20:45,610
NOT BAD, BUT IT WON'T WORK.

349
00:20:45,644 --> 00:20:48,513
I'LL NEED THE HEAT REGISTRATION VIEW FROM THE SEASAC SATELLITE.

350
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:49,648
HEAT REGISTRATION?

351
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:52,017
HOW CAN YOU POSSIBLY PINPOINT A DEEPLY SUBMERGED VESSEL?

352
00:20:52,050 --> 00:20:54,986
THE WATER AT THE SURFACE WILL--  TRUST ME. BRING IT UP.

353
00:20:55,020 --> 00:20:56,621
I'LL PUT HIM IN MY OFFICE.

354
00:20:56,655 --> 00:20:58,523
ENLARGE.

355
00:21:01,793 --> 00:21:03,895
ENLARGE TWO MORE TIMES.

356
00:21:10,569 --> 00:21:11,870
ONE MORE TIME.

357
00:21:18,810 --> 00:21:20,112
THAT'S IT.

358
00:21:20,145 --> 00:21:21,747
THAT'S THE ULYSSES.

359
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:24,449
BUT HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT FOR SURE?

362

BUT THEY HAVEN'T BUDGED.

363
00:21:29,788 --> 00:21:30,822

364
00:21:30,856 --> 00:21:34,126

WELL, LISTEN, I'M SORRY TO BRING YOU DOWN HERE LIKE THIS.

366
00:21:37,496 --> 00:21:40,499
IT'S OKAY. I'LL GRAB MY KID, AND I'M OUT OF HERE.

367
00:21:40,532 --> 00:21:52,110
SIR, THERE'S AN EMERGENCY CALL FROM THE ULYSSES.

368
00:21:52,144 --> 00:21:54,846
THIS IS ADMIRAL PENDELTON, U.S. NAVY.

369
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:57,215
Richter: AND THIS IS THE NEW CAPTAIN OF THE ULYSSES.

370
00:21:57,249 --> 00:21:59,851
THE CHIEF OF BOAT WILL NOW BRIEF YOU/

371
00:21:59,885 --> 00:22:06,024
DON'T MAKE A MISTAKE, OR YOU'LL DIE.

372
00:22:06,057 --> 00:22:08,160
THIS IS CHIEF OF THE BOAT MURPHY.

373
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,962
ULYSSES HAS BEEN TAKEN OVER BY TERRORISTS.

374
00:22:10,996 --> 00:22:12,831
THE CREW HAS BEEN GASSED.

375
00:22:12,864 --> 00:22:14,599
CAPTAIN LANGE IS DEAD.

376
00:22:14,633 --> 00:22:15,801
JESUS.

377
00:22:15,834 --> 00:22:18,904
AND?

378
00:22:18,937 --> 00:22:25,110
AND THEY HAVE THE LAUNCH KEYS.

379
00:22:25,143 --> 00:22:28,613
TO GET ULYSSES BACK WILL COST YOU $100 MILLION IN GOLD.

380
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:31,283
IF YOU DON'T COMPLY, I'LL USE THE NUCLEAR MISSILES ON BOARD

381
00:22:31,316 --> 00:22:32,984
AND DESTROY WASHINGTON, D.C.

382
00:22:33,018 --> 00:22:36,555
LISTEN UP, WHOEVER YOU ARE-- YOU HAVE NO IDEA

383
00:22:36,588 --> 00:22:38,123
WHAT WE ARE PREPARED TO DO.

384
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:41,960
( laughs ) YOU MEAN SINK US?

385
00:22:41,993 --> 00:22:43,795
I DON'T THINK SO.

386
00:22:43,829 --> 00:22:45,997
IF WE EVEN SUSPECT THERE ARE ANY SUBS NEAR US

387
00:22:46,031 --> 00:22:47,165
WE'LL LAUNCH THE MISSILES.

388
00:22:47,199 --> 00:22:50,068
YOU HAVE 24 HOURS TO DELIVER THE GOLD.

389
00:22:50,101 --> 00:22:57,709
I'LL CALL BACK WITH THE COORDINATES FOR THE DROP.

390
00:22:57,742 --> 00:23:01,847
SAPRICH, I THINK THE CREW SHOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY

391
00:23:01,880 --> 00:23:02,948
INTOXICATED BY NOW.

392
00:23:02,981 --> 00:23:13,225
HAVE THEM DRAGGED INTO THE MESS HALL AND LOCK THE DOOR.

393
00:23:13,225 --> 00:23:38,850
HAVE THEM DRAGGED INTO THE MESS HALL AND LOCK THE DOOR.

394
00:23:38,884 --> 00:23:40,352
WE'VE GOT TWO SCENARIOS.

395
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:45,123
WE CAN PAY THEM THE MONEY AND PRAY THEY GIVE THE SUB BACK

396
00:23:45,156 --> 00:23:48,059
AND DON'T JUST POINT THE MISSILES AT SOME OTHER COUNTRY,

397
00:23:48,093 --> 00:23:54,232
OR...WE BRING OUT OUR FORCES AND SINK THE ULYSSES.

398
00:23:54,266 --> 00:23:56,902
SIR, THAT'S 100 MEN AND A BILLION-DOLLAR SUBMARINE.

399
00:23:56,935 --> 00:23:59,037
IS THE PRESIDENT PREPARED TO MAKE THAT DECISION?

400
00:23:59,070 --> 00:24:00,238
HE'LL HAVE TO!

401
00:24:00,272 --> 00:24:02,007
THOSE NUKES CANNOT BE LAUNCHED!

402
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:04,709
IT WOULDN'T ONLY BE THE END OF D.C.

403
00:24:04,743 --> 00:24:06,978
THE FALLOUT WOULD POISON THE ATLANTIC, AND THE AIRBORNE

404
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,814
WILL HIT EUROPE-- UNLESS THE WIND'S BLOWING

405
00:24:09,848 --> 00:24:11,016
THE OTHER WAY.

406
00:24:11,049 --> 00:24:13,718
IN THAT CASE, THE CONTINENTAL U.S. BECOMES A VAST WASTELAND.

407
00:24:13,752 --> 00:24:14,819
WE COULD USE ANOTHER PLAN.

408
00:24:14,853 --> 00:24:17,222
THE S.S.N. DAVIES IS HEADING IN THEIR DIRECTION

409
00:24:17,255 --> 00:24:18,189
FROM THE AZORES PLATEAU.

410
00:24:18,223 --> 00:24:20,926
WHAT IF WE GET SOMEONE ONTO THE DAVIES?

411
00:24:20,959 --> 00:24:23,295
MAYBE THEY COULD USE A SUBMERSIBLE TO GET ONTO

412
00:24:23,328 --> 00:24:26,031

00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,436
OH, NO.

716
00:48:26,470 --> 00:48:27,804
MR. NEWTON?

717
00:48:27,838 --> 00:48:30,841
( Slavic accent ) I AM HERE.

718
00:48:30,874 --> 00:48:34,077
MR. NEWTON, I WAS WAITING FOR YOU TO REPORT BACK.

719
00:48:34,111 --> 00:48:36,613
YOU WENT ON PATROL.

720
00:48:36,646 --> 00:48:38,448
I FOUND NOTHING.

721
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:41,418
VERY GOOD.

722
00:48:41,451 --> 00:48:43,053
MAINTAIN YOUR POST.

723
00:48:47,357 --> 00:48:49,126
AVALLONE?

724
00:48:52,295 --> 00:48:54,231
CHECK ON MR. NEWTON.

725
00:49:00,637 --> 00:49:02,105
MICHAEL, COME BACK HERE!

726
00:49:02,139 --> 00:49:04,307
WE CAN GET IT TOGETHER!

727
00:49:04,341 --> 00:49:05,776
READY?

728
00:49:05,809 --> 00:49:08,412
JUST TEN MORE CODES, AND THEIR CONTROLS WILL BE SWITCHED

729
00:49:08,445 --> 00:49:10,747
OVER TO HARPOON MISSILES.

730
00:49:10,781 --> 00:49:13,583
YEAH, BUT EVEN THAT AMOUNT OF T.N.T. IS STILL GONNA MAKE

731
00:49:13,617 --> 00:49:14,751
A MESS OF WASHINGTON.

732
00:49:14,785 --> 00:49:16,319
DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT.

733
00:49:16,353 --> 00:49:19,489
WAGER GAVE ME SAFE TARGET COORDINATES ON A WASTELAND.

734
00:49:19,523 --> 00:49:29,332
ALL I HAVE TO DO IS REDIRECT THE MISSILES.

735
00:49:29,366 --> 00:49:30,534
RICHTER.

736
00:49:30,567 --> 00:49:33,236
THIS IS RICHTER. GO AHEAD.

737
00:49:33,270 --> 00:49:35,772
WE HAVE A PROBLEM.

738
00:49:35,806 --> 00:49:39,910
Richter: I DON'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE, BUT YOU KILLED

739
00:49:39,943 --> 00:49:43,180
ONE OF MY MEN WITH A SPEAR.

740
00:49:43,213 --> 00:49:45,515
THAT'S A STRANGE WEAPON FOR A CREW MEMBER.

741
00:49:45,549 --> 00:49:48,852
REGARDLESS OF YOUR WEAPONS, WE WILL FIND YOU AND KILL YOU,

742
00:49:48,885 --> 00:49:51,555
BLOOD FOR BLOOD, AS MY PEOPLE SAY.

743
00:49:51,588 --> 00:49:52,622
BOLANNE?

744
00:49:52,656 --> 00:49:54,424
YES?

745
00:49:54,458 --> 00:49:59,463
HELP AVALLONE SEARCH THE BOAT.

746
00:49:59,496 --> 00:50:01,498
WATCH YOUR BACK.

747
00:50:31,761 --> 00:50:33,864
( choking )  OH!

748
00:51:09,299 --> 00:51:10,800
OH!

749
00:51:10,834 --> 00:51:12,836
( grunting )  Richter: ADMIRAL

750
00:51:38,295 --> 00:51:39,563
PENDELTON?

751
00:51:39,596 --> 00:51:41,831
NO, THIS IS LIEUTENANT COMMANDER STARK.

752
00:51:41,865 --> 00:51:45,502
OH. TELL ME, HOW DOES IT LOOK?

753
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:47,437
HOW DOES WHAT LOOK?

754
00:51:47,470 --> 00:51:49,539
ALL THAT GOLD YOU'VE MANAGED TO GATHER--

755
00:51:49,573 --> 00:51:51,841
APPROXIMATELY 2 1/2 METRIC TONS.

756
00:51:51,875 --> 00:51:53,877
YOU HAVEN'T GIVEN US ENOUGH TIME.

757
00:51:53,910 --> 00:51:55,979
YOU HAD TIME TO GET A MAN ON BOARD, BUT YOU CAN'T GET

758
00:51:56,012 --> 00:51:57,013
A HOLD OF A LITTLE GOLD?

759
00:51:57,047 --> 00:51:58,515
YOU'RE NOT SPEAKING THE TRUTH.

760
00:51:58,548 --> 00:52:00,483
WHAT MAN?

761
00:52:00,517 --> 00:52:02,986
LADY, YOU'RE SO MANY MOVES BEHIND ME, IT'S ALMOST

762
00:52:03,019 --> 00:52:04,788
NOT FUN TO PLAY.

763
00:52:04,821 --> 00:52:06,590
HAVE MY GOLD READY IN 2 HOURS.

764
00:52:06,623 --> 00:52:09,059
THERE'S STILL SEVEN HOURS LEFT ON THE CLOCK.

765
00:52:09,092 --> 00:52:13,396
( hangs up ) WE'D BETTER SEND A MESSAGE

766
00:52:13,430 --> 00:52:14,965
TO CARTER.

767
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:18,335
TELL HIM THE TIME'S BEEN MOVED UP.

768
00:52:18,368 --> 00:52:20,537
♪♪  WE LOST HIM.

769
00:52:50,867 --> 00:52:55,372
SEARCH THE HALL AGAIN, ROOM BY ROOM.

770
00:52:55,405 --> 00:53:08,652
I THINK RICHTER WILL BE INTERESTED IN THAT.

771
00:53:08,685 --> 00:53:12,022
RICHTER, WE JUST FOUND THIS.

772
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:17,394
HMM. GO BACK TO YOUR POST.

773
00:53:21,631 --> 00:53:25,068
Richter: YOU'VE LOST YOUR SHORT BURST RADIO--HOW SAD.

774
00:53:25,101 --> 00:53:28,672
I KNOW HOW TERRIBLE IT FEELS TO BE CUT OFF FROM EVERYONE,

775
00:53:28,705 --> 00:53:37,013
DEMORALIZED, OUTNUMBERED, ABOUT TO DIE.

776
00:53:37,047 --> 00:53:39,949
CARTER SHOULD BE RESPONDING BY NOW.

777
00:53:39,983 --> 00:53:45,121
SIR, THERE'S A CALL FROM THE ULYSSES.

778
00:53:45,155 --> 00:53:46,790
THIS IS ADMIRAL PENDELTON.

779
00:53:46,823 --> 00:53:49,459
HERE ARE THE COORDINATES FOR THE DROP SITE--

780
00:53:49,492 --> 00:53:54,764
55.076 DEGREES LONGITUDE, 32.495 DEGREES LATITUDE.

781
00:53:54,798 --> 00:53:55,899
COPY THAT.

782
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:58,535
IF IT'S NOT DELIVERED IN ONE HOUR, WASHINGTON, D.C.,

783
00:53:58,568 --> 00:54:00,937
WILL BE GROUND ZERO.

784
00:54:00,970 --> 00:54:03,740
AND YOU NEEDN'T BOTHER SENDING YOUR MAN ANY MORE MESSAGES

785
00:54:03,773 --> 00:54:05,909
ON THE SHORT BURST RADIO.

786
00:54:05,942 --> 00:54:07,644
HE IS DEAD.

787
00:54:09,479 --> 00:54:10,914
( sighing )  MAYBE HE'S LYING.

788
00:54:15,952 --> 00:54:17,987
MAYBE THEY FOUND THE RADIO.

789
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:21,091
WHAT HAVE YOU GOT FROM INTERPOL ON THESE PEOPLE?

790
00:54:21,124 --> 00:54:23,893
UH...THEY'RE ALL PART OF A MOVEMENT THAT'S TIED TO

791
00:54:23,927 --> 00:54:26,996
A RADICAL MIDDLE-EASTERN TERRORIST GROUP--

792
00:54:27,030 --> 00:54:29,199
A WELL-FUNDED, ORGANIZED OP.

793
00:54:29,232 --> 00:54:31,801
THEIR M.O. ISN'T MONEY, IT'S THE DOMINATION OF THE FREE

794
00:54:31,835 --> 00:54:33,436
WORLD BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY.

795
00:54:33,470 --> 00:54:37,841
THEY'D USE A NUCLEAR BOMB WITHOUT A SECOND THOUGHT.

796
00:54:37,874 --> 00:54:40,110
SO, THEY PLAN TO NUKE US WHETHER WE PAY THEM OR NOT.

797
00:54:40,143 --> 00:54:45,582
I'M AFRAID THAT'S WHAT WE MUST ASSUME.

798
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:53,723
GET ME CRICHTON ON THE DAVIES.

799
00:54:53,757 --> 00:54:56,793
OUR INFORMATION LEADS US TO BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT WILL

800
00:54:56,826 --> 00:55:00,864
UPGRADE THE SITUATION TO DEFCON 3.

801
00:55:00,897 --> 00:55:04,000
YOU MAY BE OUR LAST LINE OF DEFENSE.

802
00:55:04,033 --> 00:55:05,201
I COPY THAT, SIR.

803
00:55:05,235 --> 00:55:08,505
WE NOW HAVE LONG-RANGE SONAR REGISTRATION ON THE ULYSSES.

804
00:55:08,538 --> 00:55:10,039
STAND BY...

805
00:55:10,073 --> 00:55:12,142
TO SINK THE ULYSSES.

806
00:55:28,625 --> 00:55:32,228
Carter: WELL, YOUR MAN'S DEAD--GUNTHER NEWTON.

807
00:55:32,262 --> 00:55:35,532
I BELIEVE YOU AND MR. NEWTON SHARE A COMMON ORIGIN.

808
00:55:35,565 --> 00:55:45,175
YOU WOULDN'T HAPPEN TO BE FROM THE SAME PLACE, NOW, WOULD YOU?

809
00:55:45,208 --> 00:55:46,676
YES, WE ARE.

810
00:55:46,709 --> 00:55:49,646
WE ARE FROM A WORLD YOU COULD NEVER COMPREHEND.

811
00:55:49,679 --> 00:55:51,614
A WORLD FILLED WITH DEATH.

812
00:55:51,648 --> 00:55:54,884
NOT OF OUR OWN MAKING, BUT DEATH HANDED TO US

813
00:55:54,918 --> 00:55:57,887
BY OUR ENEMIES.

814
00:55:57,921 --> 00:56:01,558
WE LEARNED TO KILL AS CHILDREN SO THAT SOME WILL SURVIVE.

815
00:56:01,591 --> 00:56:03,660
WELL, I'M SORRY YOU HAD A TOUGH CHILDHOOD, BUT THAT

816
00:56:03,693 --> 00:56:06,796
DOESN'T MEAN YOU HAVE TO KILL FIVE MILLION PEOPLE.

817
00:56:06,830 --> 00:56:09,732
YOU HAVE NO COMPREHENSION OF THE NATURE OF MY WORLD.

818
00:56:09,766 --> 00:56:13,603
YEAH, WELL, COMPREHEND THIS, ASSHOLE--YOU CAN'T FIND ME,

819
00:56:13,636 --> 00:56:16,973
BUT I KNOW EXACTLY WHERE YOU ARE, AND YOU KNOW WHAT?

820
00:56:17,006 --> 00:56:18,942
I'M ON MY WAY.

821
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:23,980
MAKE SURE ALL THE HATCHES ARE CLOSED AND LOCKED FROM

822
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:24,981
THE INSIDE.

823
00:56:25,014 --> 00:56:26,583
OUR OWN LITTLE FORTRESS.

824
00:56:26,616 --> 00:56:32,021
LET'S SEE HIM TRY TO GET PAST A STEEL DOOR.

825
00:56:32,055 --> 00:56:34,123
HOW'S THAT LEAK, GOING?

826
00:56:34,157 --> 00:56:39,095
( overlapping shouts )  IF YOU WANT YOUR GOLD,

827
00:56:39,128 --> 00:56:40,230
YOU'RE OFF-COURSE.

828
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:42,665
WE'LL PICK IT UP ON THE WAY BACK.

829
00:56:42,699 --> 00:56:43,533
BACK FROM WHERE?

830
00:56:43,566 --> 00:56:46,202
FROM LAUNCHING OUR NUCLEAR MISSILES.

831
00:56:46,236 --> 00:56:50,073
SAPRICH, ARE YOU READY FOR THE TARGET COORDINATES?

832
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:52,308
COORDINATES ARE ALREADY ENTERED FOR WASHINGTON, D.C.

833
00:56:52,342 --> 00:56:55,612
WELL, WE ARE RESETTING THEM, 41 DEGREES LATITUDE,

834
00:56:55,645 --> 00:56:57,347
74 DEGREES LONGITUDE.

835
00:56:57,380 --> 00:56:59,215
THAT'S NEW YORK CITY.

836
00:56:59,249 --> 00:57:02,085
WE'LL FIRE ONE MISSILE AND WAIT.

837
00:57:02,118 --> 00:57:04,721
THE UNITED NATIONS WILL FINALLY FIND OUT THAT IT'S BETTER TO

838
00:57:04,754 --> 00:57:07,223
GIVE THAN TO RECEIVE.

839
00:57:30,747 --> 00:57:31,848
Woman: PENTAGON.

840
00:57:31,881 --> 00:57:34,083
Tommy: CAN I SPEAK WITH SPECIAL OFFICER STARK, PLEASE?

841
00:57:34,117 --> 00:57:36,719
JUST A MOMENT, PLEASE.

842
00:57:36,753 --> 00:57:38,888
LIEUTENANT STARK.

843
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:40,356
HELLO, LISA? THIS IS TOMMY.

844
00:57:40,390 --> 00:57:43,660
HAVE YOU HEARD FROM MY DAD YET?

845
00:57:43,693 --> 00:57:46,029
YOUR FATHER'S DOING A TERRIFIC JOB, TOMMY.

846
00:57:46,062 --> 00:57:47,130
I KNEW IT.

847
00:57:47,163 --> 00:57:48,798
SO, DO YOU LIKE HIM?

848
00:57:48,831 --> 00:57:51,000
YEAH, TOMMY, VERY MUCH.

849
00:57:51,034 --> 00:57:52,302
I KNEW YOU WOULD.

850
00:57:52,335 --> 00:57:54,003
HE'S THE GREATEST.

851
00:57:54,037 --> 00:57:55,071
YEAH, HE SURE IS.

852
00:57:55,104 --> 00:57:56,005
WELL, GOTTA GO.

853
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:58,775
WE'RE GOING TO SEE THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.

854
00:57:58,808 --> 00:57:59,776
OKAY, HAVE FUN.

855
00:57:59,809 --> 00:58:00,910
BYE.

856
00:58:00,944 --> 00:58:02,879
BYE.

857
00:58:04,447 --> 00:58:05,848
HOW SOON, AUNT JANE?

858
00:58:05,882 --> 00:58:07,016
ARE YOU READY TO GO?

859
00:58:07,050 --> 00:58:09,185
UH-HUH.

860
00:58:16,059 --> 00:58:18,761
THE COORDINATES ARE ENTERED.

861
00:58:21,364 --> 00:58:23,232
I'M ENCRYPTING THE SYSTEM.

862
00:58:31,708 --> 00:58:33,109
ENCRYPTION COMPLETED.

863
00:58:34,377 --> 00:58:37,313
WHAT THE HELL?

864
00:58:37,347 --> 00:58:40,383
WELL DONE, MR. SAPRICH.

865
00:58:40,416 --> 00:58:43,152
WE'RE NOW WITHIN FIRING RANGE, MR. ROBINSON.

866
00:58:43,186 --> 00:58:47,123
( sonar beeping )  SHIT, WE GOT US A U.S.L.A.

867
00:58:55,999 --> 00:58:57,800
CLASS SUB ON OUR TAIL.

868
00:59:00,236 --> 00:59:02,405
FLOOD TORPEDO TUBES ONE THROUGH FOUR.

869
00:59:02,438 --> 00:59:04,173
ONE THROUGH FOUR FLOODED.

870
00:59:05,775 --> 00:59:06,809
TORPEDO DOORS OPEN, SIR.

871
00:59:06,843 --> 00:59:08,144
FIRE TWO, THREE AND FOUR.

872
00:59:14,050 --> 00:59:15,251
TWO TORPEDOES, SIR!

873
00:59:15,284 --> 00:59:21,290
RANGE, 600 YARDS, BEARING 048050, 50 KNOTS, SIR.

874
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:22,492
WHAT DO WE DO?

875
00:59:22,525 --> 00:59:25,361
IF YOU DON'T TELL ME, WE ALL DIE.

876
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:28,831
CHRIST. ROBINSON, RELEASE COUNTERMEASURE NOW.

877
00:59:28,865 --> 00:59:30,900
COUNTERMEASURES AWAY, AYE.

878
00:59:37,073 --> 00:59:38,174
CLOSING FAST, SIR!

879
00:59:38,207 --> 00:59:40,510
SHIT, WE ONLY GOT 15 SECONDS TO IMPACT!

880
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:44,881
COLLINS, TAKE BALLASTS TO EMERGENCY SEQUENCE. DIVE! DIVE!

881
00:59:44,914 --> 00:59:46,416
OH!

00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:53,122
FIRST TIER BALLAST TANKS FULL!

00:59:53,156 --> 01:00:02,031
SECOND TIER BALLAST TANKS FULL!

884
01:00:02,065 --> 01:00:04,000
TORPEDOES GOING AFTER COUNTERMEASURES.

885
01:00:04,033 --> 01:00:05,301
BRACE FOR IMPACT!

886
01:00:10,373 --> 01:00:12,442

887
01:00:24,487 --> 01:00:26,355
FIRE EXTINGUISHER!

888
01:00:28,224 --> 01:00:30,860
WE GOT IT!

889
01:00:30,893 --> 01:00:33,496
I GOT HIM, I GOT HIM!

890
01:00:33,529 --> 01:00:35,298
AH! HURRY!

WAGER, WHAT'S THE IMMEDIATE TERRAIN?

903
01:01:22,111 --> 01:01:23,513
THERE'S A TRENCH BENEATH US.

904
01:01:23,546 --> 01:01:25,982
WE CAN OUTRUN THEM, WE CAN LOSE THEM IN THE CANYON.

905
01:01:26,015 --> 01:01:27,884
WE CAN'T DO ANY OF THAT IF YOU SHOOT THE DRIVER.

906
01:01:27,917 --> 01:01:30,019
GET DENT ON THE LINE, HE CAN CALL THE TURNS WITH SONAR.

907
01:01:30,052 --> 01:01:31,154

924
01:03:08,718 --> 01:03:10,319
THEY'VE ACQUIRED US AGAIN.

01:03:10,353 --> 01:03:12,054
GET READY FOR A HARD RIGHT.

926
01:03:12,088 --> 01:03:12,922

938
01:03:57,733 --> 01:03:59,001

WE'VE LOST SONAR CONTACT.

01:04:29,832 --> 01:04:32,335
IT'S THESE TRENCHES.

949
01:04:32,368 --> 01:04:33,469

THEY'VE GOT A LOCK ON US!

986
01:06:38,894 --> 01:06:41,464
MR. PRESIDENT, IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

987
01:06:41,497 --> 01:06:43,532
THEY SUNK THE S.S.N. DAVIES.

AYE-AYE, SIR.

996
01:07:24,807 --> 01:07:28,277
NOW, THAT WAS STIMULATING.

997
01:07:28,310 --> 01:07:32,548
COLLINS, TAKE US UP TO PERISCOPE DEPTH...

998
01:07:32,581 --> 01:07:35,518

999
01:07:37,953 --> 01:07:39,588
DO IT.

1000
01:07:39,622 --> 01:07:41,257
DO IT, COLLINS.

1001
01:07:41,290 --> 01:07:42,491
IT'S NOT WORTH DYING OVER.

1002
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:43,526
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

1003
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,528
DON'T YOU GET IT YET, COLLEGE BOY?

1004
01:07:45,561 --> 01:07:46,862
THIS IS ABOUT SURVIVAL.

1005
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:47,897
DO IT, COLLINS.

1006
01:07:47,930 --> 01:07:49,398
HOW POETIC.

1007
01:07:49,431 --> 01:07:54,537
SURFACE NOW, OR YOUR HEAD GETS BLOWN OFF.

1008
01:07:54,570 --> 01:07:56,338
PREPARE TO SURFACE.

1009
01:08:02,678 --> 01:08:04,613

1010
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:07,383

NOW DO THE MATH FOR ME, MR. MacDONALD.

1018
01:08:46,889 --> 01:08:50,326
HOW MUCH DAMAGE CAN A SINGLE NUCLEAR WARHEAD DO TO A CITY

1019
01:08:50,359 --> 01:08:51,827
THE SIZE OF NEW YORK?

1020
01:08:51,860 --> 01:08:55,798
WELL, WE ALL FIND OUT IN EXACTLY FIVE MINUTES...

1021
01:08:55,831 --> 01:08:58,500
STARTING NOW.

1022
01:09:03,572 --> 01:09:05,941
THE LIGHTS OF BROADWAY ARE ABOUT TO GO DOWN, AND I

1023
01:09:05,975 --> 01:09:09,578
NEVER EVEN SAW DAMN YANKEES.

1024
01:09:09,612 --> 01:09:12,615
WE SWING BACK, PICK UP THE GOLD, IF THERE IS ANY,

1025
01:09:12,648 --> 01:09:15,317

1040
01:11:35,824 --> 01:11:38,527
STAND UP OR I'LL KILL YOU!

1041
01:11:43,999 --> 01:11:46,902
WELL, THAT WAS LIKE IN THE GOOD OLD DAYS.

1042
01:11:46,935 --> 01:11:48,170
YOU TRAITOR BASTARD.

1043
01:11:48,203 --> 01:11:50,572
YOU WERE IN ON THIS THE WHOLE TIME, HUH, MURPHY?

1044
01:11:50,606 --> 01:11:51,440
YOU'RE GODDAMN RIGHT.

1045
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:53,842
THE ONLY THING MY LOYALTY EVER GOT ME--

1046
01:11:53,876 --> 01:11:55,043
BULLSHIT, LOYALTY.

1047
01:11:55,077 --> 01:11:56,478
HOW DO YOU CALL THIS LOYALTY?

1048
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:58,480
YOU CONTINUE TO BE INVALUABLE, MURPHY.

1049
01:11:58,514 --> 01:12:01,083
HOW DO YOU FEEL? WE'RE ONLY MOMENTS AWAY FROM LAUNCH.

1050
01:12:01,116 --> 01:12:02,985
DAMN GOOD RIGHT NOW.

1051
01:12:03,018 --> 01:12:05,120
40 SECONDS TILL LAUNCH.

1052
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,523
THE MISSILES TAKE A LITTLE OVER FOUR MINUTES TO GET

1053
01:12:07,556 --> 01:12:08,991
TO NEW YORK.

1054
01:12:25,841 --> 01:12:27,576
MURPHY, GO AFTER HIM!

1055
01:12:27,609 --> 01:12:28,744
THE REST OF YOU, STAY DOWN.

1056
01:12:37,619 --> 01:12:39,588
YOU ARE DEAD.

1057
01:12:42,057 --> 01:12:44,560
STABILIZE THE SHIP, MR. COLLINS.

1058
01:12:44,593 --> 01:12:46,495
DO IT.

1059
01:12:58,674 --> 01:12:59,842
WHERE TO?

1060
01:12:59,875 --> 01:13:01,610

DOORS OPEN.

1064
01:13:23,599 --> 01:13:25,801
WE'RE LOSING MAIN ENGINE POWER!

1065
01:13:25,834 --> 01:13:26,969
WE CAN'T FIRE, DAMN IT.

1066
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:28,570
WE'RE TAKING ON TOO MUCH WATER.

1067
01:13:28,604 --> 01:13:29,671
YOU'LL KILL US ALL!

1068
01:13:29,705 --> 01:13:30,939
UHH!

1069
01:13:38,847 --> 01:13:40,916
( beeping )  WE HAVE MAIN ENGINE FAILURE!

1070
01:14:02,738 --> 01:14:04,706
