1
00:00:42,944 --> 00:00:46,246
We can be here all night long
until you talk. I don't care.

2
00:00:47,749 --> 00:00:48,783
Where are the bodies at?

3
00:00:53,086 --> 00:00:55,455
Help us
and we can help you, okay?

4
00:00:57,357 --> 00:01:00,595
It can be the difference
between a full life in prison

5
00:01:01,295 --> 00:01:02,664
or the death penalty.

6
00:01:05,499 --> 00:01:07,502
Joe, come on, just talk to us.

7
00:01:08,503 --> 00:01:09,671
Where are the bodies?

8
00:01:29,958 --> 00:01:31,425
Right now,
we only have five bodies.

9
00:01:32,961 --> 00:01:34,796
All seem to have been dead
for about a week.

10
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:42,537
Oddly enough, there's not a single
drop of blood around the house.

11
00:01:45,607 --> 00:01:47,809
I'm not sure if the victims
were killed somewhere else,

12
00:01:48,442 --> 00:01:49,544
then brought here.

13
00:01:52,013 --> 00:01:53,648
Jesus Christ.

14
00:01:58,352 --> 00:01:59,319
Shit.

15
00:01:59,453 --> 00:02:00,788
Hey, get this one right here.

16
00:02:03,457 --> 00:02:05,093
Seems like death of suffocation.

17
00:02:06,027 --> 00:02:07,829
Has anybody been
in the restroom yet?

18
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:12,667
I didn't see any bodies, but go
ahead and get pictures of all the rooms.

19
00:02:16,537 --> 00:02:18,573
Seems there's something
in his mouth.

20
00:02:20,541 --> 00:02:22,142
Jesus!

21
00:02:27,582 --> 00:02:28,683
Stay here.

22
00:02:30,250 --> 00:02:31,853
Ma'am.

23
00:02:31,986 --> 00:02:33,320
Ma'am!

24
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:36,057
It's okay.
Where is he? Where is he?

25
00:02:38,660 --> 00:02:39,761
Stay here!

26
00:02:55,610 --> 00:02:58,046
Shit!

27
00:02:58,946 --> 00:03:01,348
Fuck.
He has a hazmat suit on!

28
00:03:15,362 --> 00:03:16,731
Everyone's hands up now!

29
00:03:18,066 --> 00:03:19,332
Put your hands up now!

30
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,403
Take your head gear off!

31
00:03:24,337 --> 00:03:25,238
Take it off!

32
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:32,613
Shit!

33
00:03:38,285 --> 00:03:40,287
Fuck!

34
00:03:40,420 --> 00:03:41,522
Fuck.

35
00:04:13,821 --> 00:04:14,722
Can you hear me?

36
00:04:16,057 --> 00:04:16,991
How's everything sounding?

37
00:04:17,592 --> 00:04:19,026
Did you check the XLR cable?

38
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,796
Dave, you always got to check
the XLR cable, okay?

39
00:04:24,232 --> 00:04:26,567
Yeah, the cable's fine. It was
just the levels. We're good.

40
00:04:27,068 --> 00:04:28,736
Okay, do we need to do
a sound check?

41
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:32,607
- Yeah.
- Okay, uh, this is Beth Stewart.

42
00:04:33,207 --> 00:04:37,111
We are in Houston, uh,
doing our final video project

43
00:04:37,245 --> 00:04:38,913
at the absolute last second.

44
00:04:40,047 --> 00:04:41,682
Uh, blah, blah, blah.

45
00:04:41,816 --> 00:04:45,086
- I'm tired, I'm hungry. I wanna go home.
- Good.

46
00:04:45,787 --> 00:04:46,854
- All right.
- Good?

47
00:04:47,255 --> 00:04:48,256
Okay, um...

48
00:04:48,823 --> 00:04:50,558
- All right.
- Take one. Action.

49
00:04:50,925 --> 00:04:53,161
Are we like triple sure
that everything's going...

50
00:04:53,293 --> 00:04:54,662
Yes. Go, go.

51
00:04:55,897 --> 00:04:58,766
Hi, this is Beth Stewart
with South Vista College.

52
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,301
We're standing outside Houston,
Texas, which is said to have

53
00:05:01,434 --> 00:05:05,039
one of the largest missing
persons' cases in the United States.

54
00:05:05,338 --> 00:05:09,409
We are at the exact location where
a family went missing 20 years ago.

55
00:05:09,777 --> 00:05:12,280
Jack Stern, his wife,
and their two children.

56
00:05:13,214 --> 00:05:15,616
The only thing left behind
at the scene was their car.

57
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:17,852
Not a single drop
of blood was found.

58
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:21,088
That was good. Let's, uh, cut?

59
00:05:21,923 --> 00:05:22,723
How was that?

60
00:05:23,291 --> 00:05:26,426
It was good. I think all
we need now is B-roll, right?

61
00:05:26,561 --> 00:05:27,895
Yeah, let's, let's wrap it up.

62
00:05:29,130 --> 00:05:30,531
It's good. Let's go.

63
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:32,099
Let's go!

64
00:05:34,869 --> 00:05:37,705
I don't know about this project.
It's kind of lame.

65
00:05:38,438 --> 00:05:40,975
We can't just go to a spot
where people went missing.

66
00:05:41,843 --> 00:05:44,444
Um, yes we can.
And that's what we're doing.

67
00:05:45,813 --> 00:05:47,849
There's nothing lame
about a missing family.

68
00:05:48,381 --> 00:05:49,283
It's like...

69
00:05:50,051 --> 00:05:51,484
I don't know
if you've ever been...

70
00:05:53,688 --> 00:05:55,388
...friends with somebody
that went missing,

71
00:05:55,523 --> 00:05:57,390
but I think
it's an interesting story.

72
00:05:59,660 --> 00:06:01,361
I wanna do something...

73
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:04,866
Oh, my God, I...

74
00:06:05,266 --> 00:06:07,702
Val, I'm...

75
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:09,837
You... Uh...

76
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:11,772
You're such a loser, John.

77
00:06:11,906 --> 00:06:13,473
He's so innocent.

78
00:06:14,208 --> 00:06:15,877
Do you wanna do something scary?

79
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:19,146
Yeah. Unique and scary.

80
00:06:19,747 --> 00:06:23,416
Okay, I have an idea, but let's
grab food, and then let's go...

81
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:24,484
I'll see you in there.

82
00:06:25,418 --> 00:06:27,021
Then we can go to my ap...
Apartment. What does he mean?

83
00:06:27,154 --> 00:06:28,689
- Food sounds great.
- What does he...?

84
00:06:29,857 --> 00:06:30,758
Guys?

85
00:06:31,491 --> 00:06:32,360
Hey, guys.

86
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:34,829
That... That's not funny.

87
00:06:36,030 --> 00:06:36,964
Guys!

88
00:06:39,967 --> 00:06:41,002
Help.

89
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:43,571
Oh, fuck.

90
00:06:43,971 --> 00:06:45,773
Dave, can you please
not film me eating?

91
00:06:46,374 --> 00:06:47,407
It's kind of weird.

92
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:50,611
We need lots of behind-the-scenes
footage for the Blu-ray.

93
00:06:51,411 --> 00:06:53,247
Trust me,
no one's buying a student film.

94
00:06:53,381 --> 00:06:54,615
Nice shoes.

95
00:06:55,316 --> 00:06:59,020
You know, speaking of jobs, have
you guys had any luck finding one?

96
00:06:59,153 --> 00:07:03,391
I've got internships or calls,
but I haven't had an actual job.

97
00:07:04,191 --> 00:07:06,594
No. Every time I say I'm
graduating from South Vista College,

98
00:07:06,727 --> 00:07:08,062
they say
they've never heard of it.

99
00:07:08,863 --> 00:07:11,666
- People literally call it the 13th grade.
- Oh.

100
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:14,101
But how old are you?

101
00:07:15,036 --> 00:07:15,970
Twenty-eight.

102
00:07:16,469 --> 00:07:17,470
John, how old are you?

103
00:07:17,605 --> 00:07:19,640
- Uh, 25.
- Dave?

104
00:07:20,174 --> 00:07:21,909
- Thirty.
- See, I'm 36.

105
00:07:22,043 --> 00:07:23,678
It's just a college of misfits.

106
00:07:24,078 --> 00:07:26,547
Nowhere to go.
Nothing to do, but...

107
00:07:26,681 --> 00:07:30,551
...literally, we're just in the middle of
nowhere filming for missing people.

108
00:07:31,419 --> 00:07:34,522
Oh yeah, it's not the easiest
industry to get into.

109
00:07:34,655 --> 00:07:38,726
Most people that do film end up
serving coffee or working as a florist.

110
00:07:39,093 --> 00:07:40,594
Florists make good money.

111
00:07:41,896 --> 00:07:42,930
What about you, Dave?

112
00:07:43,496 --> 00:07:45,099
Well, I did get
a call back one time.

113
00:07:45,232 --> 00:07:46,767
Um, when I arrived to set,

114
00:07:46,901 --> 00:07:49,303
there was a guy wearing
a superhero costume,

115
00:07:49,437 --> 00:07:51,939
and a naked chick.

116
00:07:52,472 --> 00:07:54,075
Are you serious?

117
00:07:54,709 --> 00:07:55,810
Yup.

118
00:07:57,011 --> 00:07:58,713
Did you... You s... You stayed.

119
00:07:58,846 --> 00:08:00,214
Please tell me that you stayed.

120
00:08:00,348 --> 00:08:02,984
It was good money.

121
00:08:03,117 --> 00:08:05,485
What was the name of it?
Please tell me the name.

122
00:08:05,953 --> 00:08:07,989
<i>The Incredible Bulk.</i>

123
00:08:08,122 --> 00:08:10,057
Oh, my God.

124
00:08:10,458 --> 00:08:12,860
Okay. Okay. Serious question.

125
00:08:12,994 --> 00:08:14,562
- Like it?
- You have to answer it.

126
00:08:15,730 --> 00:08:18,432
Are they still hiring?

127
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:23,137
Uh, yeah, just excuse
the mess, like the wall.

128
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:26,674
Oh, my God.

129
00:08:27,942 --> 00:08:31,045
Val,
what the hell is going on here?

130
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:33,080
- Yeah.
- Okay. Yeah. I,

131
00:08:33,214 --> 00:08:34,982
I should have mentioned it
before you guys got here,

132
00:08:35,116 --> 00:08:39,820
but I, I do have this slight
obsession with serial killers.

133
00:08:40,121 --> 00:08:42,923
Um, to be fair,
it did start very...

134
00:08:43,758 --> 00:08:46,260
...like, innocent, you know,
true crime and stuff like that.

135
00:08:46,394 --> 00:08:49,864
But I, I did end up
writing a serial killer.

136
00:08:50,364 --> 00:08:53,401
- So... -You wrote a serial killer.
- Cool.

137
00:08:53,534 --> 00:08:55,202
No, like...
you know...

138
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:58,706
I wrote some serial killers,
just to put 'em out there.

139
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:00,307
- That's better.
- Yeah.

140
00:09:00,441 --> 00:09:01,542
Um, but...

141
00:09:02,143 --> 00:09:04,378
You're like
the last person on Earth

142
00:09:04,513 --> 00:09:07,014
- I ever thought would be into this.
- -No...

143
00:09:08,215 --> 00:09:10,017
I know, but, like, look at all
the stuff that they send me.

144
00:09:10,151 --> 00:09:11,852
They send me, like, this,
and they write me

145
00:09:11,986 --> 00:09:13,554
so many letters
and they're so nice.

146
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:16,190
Like, honestly, but... They are!

147
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:18,793
I'm just...

148
00:09:19,528 --> 00:09:22,630
They send me this stuff, and I guess
they don't have anything better to do.

149
00:09:22,763 --> 00:09:23,931
- Ah...
- Yeah.

150
00:09:24,065 --> 00:09:24,999
But prison.

151
00:09:25,132 --> 00:09:26,734
I did want to show you guys

152
00:09:26,867 --> 00:09:31,105
that I joined this,
like, secret online group.

153
00:09:31,238 --> 00:09:32,907
It's like a community
of people like me.

154
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:35,743
A community
of serial killer lovers.

155
00:09:35,876 --> 00:09:38,179
No, like morbid
curiosity lovers.

156
00:09:38,312 --> 00:09:40,614
- Don't be ridiculous, come on.
- Show us.

157
00:09:40,748 --> 00:09:43,717
Okay. Okay.
Uh, we use these, um...

158
00:09:44,452 --> 00:09:48,456
...like, off the grid message
boards, if that makes sense.

159
00:09:48,589 --> 00:09:49,490
The dark web?

160
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,258
I, I'm not ridiculous.

161
00:09:51,392 --> 00:09:53,327
No, they, it's...

162
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:56,030
It's like an anonymous chat,
but there has been this chat

163
00:09:56,163 --> 00:09:58,165
that's been going crazy
for like weeks...

164
00:09:58,299 --> 00:09:59,834
- Mm-hmm.
- ...and it's this.

165
00:10:00,468 --> 00:10:04,271
It's, like, this urban legend
of this serial killer guy

166
00:10:04,405 --> 00:10:09,610
who went and killed, like, 200
people over the last 20 years.

167
00:10:09,743 --> 00:10:11,245
Apparently, he would...

168
00:10:12,379 --> 00:10:15,349
...kidnap them and then
take them into his farm.

169
00:10:15,483 --> 00:10:17,952
It's, like, in the middle
of nowhere, and he'd kill 'em.

170
00:10:18,319 --> 00:10:19,653
But that's not even
the craziest part. The cra...

171
00:10:19,787 --> 00:10:21,155
Like, he would
actually broadcast

172
00:10:21,288 --> 00:10:24,425
these weird videos
of their bodies.

173
00:10:24,559 --> 00:10:28,062
I don't know, like, I guess over an
antenna television or something like that.

174
00:10:28,462 --> 00:10:30,164
But they did call him Mr. Creep.

175
00:10:31,499 --> 00:10:34,001
Sounds like
creepy noodles bullshit.

176
00:10:34,135 --> 00:10:35,236
- Okay, I'm just...
- Yeah.

177
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:36,937
You couldn't hide
a serial killer

178
00:10:37,071 --> 00:10:39,340
that killed 200 people
from the public.

179
00:10:39,473 --> 00:10:41,675
I'm just telling you
what I read, because...

180
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:44,513
- Okay.
- Yeah, it's all BS.

181
00:10:44,645 --> 00:10:46,180
It... It's not BS.

182
00:10:46,313 --> 00:10:49,150
You... Do you guys wanna see
one of the videos?

183
00:10:49,283 --> 00:10:52,253
Apparently one of the broadcasts
were actually recorded.

184
00:10:53,487 --> 00:10:54,589
- Yeah, whatever.
- Okay.

185
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:56,023
- Okay.
- I can't wait.

186
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:02,363
Creepy dolls? Check.

187
00:11:02,631 --> 00:11:03,731
Scary clowns?

188
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:05,332
A mysterious broadcast signal

189
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:07,301
sending out weird videos?

190
00:11:07,868 --> 00:11:08,969
Double check.

191
00:11:09,436 --> 00:11:11,438
Today, I bring you
an insanely creepy urban legend

192
00:11:11,573 --> 00:11:14,141
that's been flooding
the deep spaces of the Internet.

193
00:11:14,675 --> 00:11:17,646
The story of Mr. Creep.

194
00:11:17,778 --> 00:11:20,814
The story claims a mass murderer
who wore an old clown mask,

195
00:11:20,948 --> 00:11:22,816
and went around kidnapping
people, then taking them

196
00:11:22,950 --> 00:11:26,588
to a secret hideout in the middle of
nowhere where he would murder them.

197
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,790
The city kept the killer a secret
in order not to cause a panic.

198
00:11:29,924 --> 00:11:33,494
He was said to broadcast weird
videos with the dead bodies of victims.

199
00:11:33,761 --> 00:11:37,198
Some say the broadcast is still
sending out signals to this day,

200
00:11:37,566 --> 00:11:39,033
but it hasn't been found.

201
00:11:39,166 --> 00:11:42,036
Only one recording
of a broadcast exists today,

202
00:11:42,169 --> 00:11:43,470
and we're gonna show it
to you...

203
00:11:44,438 --> 00:11:45,372
...right now.

204
00:11:55,316 --> 00:11:56,217
I, uh...

205
00:12:04,792 --> 00:12:06,093
I come home

206
00:12:06,227 --> 00:12:08,829
after working a 12-hour shift...

207
00:12:09,997 --> 00:12:11,298
...I cook dinner,

208
00:12:11,966 --> 00:12:15,436
and all I get
is a mouthful of insults.

209
00:12:19,940 --> 00:12:21,041
Oh.

210
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,010
What was that?

211
00:12:24,378 --> 00:12:28,082
Oh. Oh, you don't,
you don't like fish heads?

212
00:12:29,718 --> 00:12:30,719
Hmm.

213
00:12:30,851 --> 00:12:32,987
Well, little Johnny...

214
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:35,789
...he likes fish heads.

215
00:12:36,457 --> 00:12:37,358
You know why?

216
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:40,194
Because Johnny's a good boy.

217
00:12:41,228 --> 00:12:44,365
Yeah. Unlike his siblings.

218
00:12:45,799 --> 00:12:47,101
Worthless...

219
00:12:47,768 --> 00:12:49,036
...leeches.

220
00:12:49,504 --> 00:12:50,838
Oh.

221
00:12:50,971 --> 00:12:52,039
What was that?

222
00:12:52,741 --> 00:12:54,008
What was that, dear? Did...

223
00:12:54,141 --> 00:12:55,876
Did you wanna say something?

224
00:12:57,612 --> 00:12:59,079
No. What did you say to me?

225
00:12:59,681 --> 00:13:01,982
What did you say to me?

226
00:13:05,986 --> 00:13:07,321
You will eat!

227
00:13:16,997 --> 00:13:19,266
That's it.

228
00:13:19,734 --> 00:13:20,834
Christ, Val.

229
00:13:21,670 --> 00:13:23,103
And you wrote to this guy?

230
00:13:23,237 --> 00:13:26,006
No, I wish. He died years
after he was caught,

231
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:28,409
but if he was alive,
of course, I would.

232
00:13:28,777 --> 00:13:29,977
Why?

233
00:13:30,110 --> 00:13:31,345
I don't know, he just...

234
00:13:32,212 --> 00:13:35,015
Like, I know he was messed up,
and I don't know why,

235
00:13:35,149 --> 00:13:38,919
because, like, it sounds crazy, but
I feel like I could have helped him.

236
00:13:39,654 --> 00:13:42,590
- Yeah, that's messed up.
- Uh, okay...

237
00:13:42,724 --> 00:13:45,292
They said that the broadcast
was still running, right?

238
00:13:45,893 --> 00:13:46,960
People claim it is.

239
00:13:47,294 --> 00:13:49,129
Well, then all we would need is

240
00:13:49,263 --> 00:13:50,799
an antenna and an old TV,

241
00:13:50,931 --> 00:13:53,100
and we could keep
this thing going, right?

242
00:13:53,568 --> 00:13:55,202
Does anyone
even have one of those?

243
00:13:55,603 --> 00:13:57,639
- I have one.
- Can we use it?

244
00:13:57,772 --> 00:13:59,440
Yeah. We just need an antenna.

245
00:14:09,416 --> 00:14:12,086
...watching Channel 99...

246
00:14:13,253 --> 00:14:16,624
Most kids learned their
sex basics from Channel 99.

247
00:14:16,758 --> 00:14:17,659
100% of it.

248
00:14:17,792 --> 00:14:19,093
Where's the power?

249
00:14:19,960 --> 00:14:22,329
Okay. Cool.

250
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:27,401
Jesus. We're gonna get channels
from, like, China with that thing.

251
00:14:29,269 --> 00:14:31,773
- I hope so.
- -Definitely China with that thing.

252
00:14:31,905 --> 00:14:33,775
Hmm.

253
00:14:34,908 --> 00:14:40,247
All right.
I think everything is set up.

254
00:14:41,716 --> 00:14:43,384
Let's see how this looks.

255
00:14:46,954 --> 00:14:49,524
Uh, I think you have to...
What is it?

256
00:14:49,657 --> 00:14:52,025
The channel scan.
You gotta do the channel scan.

257
00:15:16,350 --> 00:15:19,420
- Damn.
- I guess that settles it. I guess, um...

258
00:15:20,855 --> 00:15:22,590
- Well...
- Just Internet clickbait.

259
00:15:23,157 --> 00:15:24,626
I'll just return this.

260
00:15:26,326 --> 00:15:27,829
- I guess...
- Wait, wait, wait.

261
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,564
What?

262
00:15:30,097 --> 00:15:31,231
I saw it too.

263
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:33,167
Don't you see?

264
00:16:02,530 --> 00:16:05,966
Dammit, it...
I just bought this thing.

265
00:16:06,099 --> 00:16:07,367
Check the plug.

266
00:16:07,968 --> 00:16:10,037
It... It was plugged in.

267
00:16:10,905 --> 00:16:13,440
I mean,
the antenna looks fine, but...

268
00:16:14,542 --> 00:16:16,310
Nice, Dave.

269
00:16:16,443 --> 00:16:18,412
- Um, anything?
- No.

270
00:16:19,514 --> 00:16:21,381
- Guys, we have to dig deeper into this.
- -All right...

271
00:16:21,516 --> 00:16:23,350
There's history here,
it's real, I know it.

272
00:16:23,484 --> 00:16:26,186
And do what? There's,
like, no info on this guy.

273
00:16:26,320 --> 00:16:27,822
We wouldn't even know
where to start looking.

274
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:30,157
The abandoned police station.

275
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:33,427
Wouldn't they take all their
files with them when they left?

276
00:16:33,561 --> 00:16:35,496
No. It's just like
abandoned hospitals.

277
00:16:35,630 --> 00:16:38,131
Like, when state funding goes,
like, everyone just walks out,

278
00:16:38,265 --> 00:16:40,133
and they leave everything.
Even patient files.

279
00:16:40,267 --> 00:16:43,538
Okay, well, we're not gonna break
into an abandoned police station

280
00:16:43,671 --> 00:16:45,673
- for a school project.
- -But forget about the school project.

281
00:16:45,807 --> 00:16:48,308
This is something bigger. We could
discover, like, the new Ted Bundy

282
00:16:48,442 --> 00:16:49,978
that the world never discovered.

283
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:53,180
Exactly. We, we could make
a real documentary with this.

284
00:16:53,313 --> 00:16:56,951
I mean, this would help our career
way more than an associate's degree

285
00:16:57,084 --> 00:16:59,486
- from a community college.
- That we're never gonna use.

286
00:16:59,621 --> 00:17:01,088
- Fine.
- I'm sold.

287
00:17:01,455 --> 00:17:04,826
Because, honestly, we don't have

288
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,728
any other job offers right now.

289
00:17:06,861 --> 00:17:09,429
Why don't we just take a day,
think about it,

290
00:17:09,564 --> 00:17:11,231
and then come back tomorrow,

291
00:17:11,365 --> 00:17:13,066
and we can talk about
your little mystery mission.

292
00:17:13,200 --> 00:17:15,937
But let's just go tonight. My
adrenaline's running. Why wait?

293
00:17:16,069 --> 00:17:18,640
Yeah, I agree. I mean,
I know none of us have jobs.

294
00:17:18,773 --> 00:17:21,041
I have a job.

295
00:17:22,042 --> 00:17:23,277
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

296
00:17:28,448 --> 00:17:29,651
Do you hear voices?

297
00:17:35,155 --> 00:17:37,057
Yes.

298
00:17:39,027 --> 00:17:40,127
What do they say?

299
00:17:45,332 --> 00:17:47,835
"Cool...

300
00:17:47,969 --> 00:17:49,436
...to kill people."

301
00:17:57,344 --> 00:17:58,713
Any certain people?

302
00:18:02,984 --> 00:18:04,084
Anyone.

303
00:18:08,121 --> 00:18:09,423
Okay.

304
00:18:09,991 --> 00:18:11,859
And who do the voices come from?

305
00:18:16,129 --> 00:18:18,533
A floating head.

306
00:18:21,669 --> 00:18:22,570
A floating head?

307
00:18:23,605 --> 00:18:24,505
Yes.

308
00:18:33,815 --> 00:18:35,550
I mean, I really hope
something happens.

309
00:18:36,249 --> 00:18:38,052
- I'm really looking forward to it.
- -You do?

310
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:39,419
I do.

311
00:18:39,921 --> 00:18:41,756
Okay, I'm not gonna park
in the front.

312
00:18:41,889 --> 00:18:43,625
This is...

313
00:18:43,758 --> 00:18:45,793
...pretty shady,
so I'm gonna go to the side.

314
00:18:54,134 --> 00:18:55,235
This is good.

315
00:18:56,370 --> 00:18:57,872
Okay, so what's the plan here?

316
00:18:58,338 --> 00:18:59,807
Well, Dave knows the layout.

317
00:19:02,510 --> 00:19:03,611
You do?

318
00:19:04,244 --> 00:19:05,847
Well, not really, but...

319
00:19:06,213 --> 00:19:07,081
Okay, perfect.

320
00:19:07,214 --> 00:19:08,116
I'll tell you what,

321
00:19:08,248 --> 00:19:09,383
I'm gonna stay in the car,

322
00:19:09,751 --> 00:19:11,853
and keep a watch,
because trespassing is no joke.

323
00:19:11,986 --> 00:19:14,856
You guys go check it out,
and I'll keep it warm for you.

324
00:19:17,125 --> 00:19:20,460
- All right, Val, Dave... Let's go.
- All right.

325
00:19:25,033 --> 00:19:26,266
Watch out for the spiders.

326
00:19:27,101 --> 00:19:28,268
Oh, my God.

327
00:19:29,202 --> 00:19:30,638
That's creepy, okay.

328
00:19:32,507 --> 00:19:34,776
Let's just get in, get out.

329
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,343
Do this fast.

330
00:19:37,712 --> 00:19:38,880
Oh, my gosh.

331
00:19:39,781 --> 00:19:41,314
Oh, f...

332
00:19:41,448 --> 00:19:42,950
Fuck. Just jimmy it.

333
00:19:56,664 --> 00:19:58,432
What are we supposed
to be looking for?

334
00:19:59,399 --> 00:20:00,735
Files, pictures.

335
00:20:00,868 --> 00:20:02,036
I don't know.

336
00:20:02,804 --> 00:20:04,539
What was this place, a museum?

337
00:20:05,006 --> 00:20:08,375
What the h...?
Is somebody living here?

338
00:20:12,647 --> 00:20:13,548
Whoa.

339
00:20:14,582 --> 00:20:16,416
- Beth. Beth.
- Val.

340
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:18,586
- Holy shit.
- Oh, my God. Okay.

341
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,755
They left everything.

342
00:20:20,888 --> 00:20:23,591
Um, what are we looking for?
Do you know his name?

343
00:20:23,725 --> 00:20:25,358
I know that he wore
a creepy clown mask,

344
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:27,829
and went by the name Mr. Creep,
but no, I don't know his name.

345
00:20:28,395 --> 00:20:30,832
Okay, just everyone start
digging through stuff.

346
00:20:35,503 --> 00:20:36,838
I'm gonna look upstairs.

347
00:20:52,452 --> 00:20:53,621
Oh, my God.

348
00:21:01,028 --> 00:21:01,963
Whoa.

349
00:21:03,765 --> 00:21:05,398
This must be the holding area.

350
00:21:19,547 --> 00:21:21,314
What the fuck?

351
00:21:28,455 --> 00:21:29,724
What the hell?

352
00:21:37,430 --> 00:21:38,566
Gross.

353
00:21:44,972 --> 00:21:45,873
What?

354
00:21:48,242 --> 00:21:49,342
Beth?

355
00:21:52,013 --> 00:21:52,914
Beth.

356
00:21:55,750 --> 00:21:59,687
No! Beth!
Please, please, no! Please!

357
00:22:03,991 --> 00:22:04,892
Anything?

358
00:22:06,326 --> 00:22:07,261
There's a door here.

359
00:22:15,136 --> 00:22:16,369
That might be it.

360
00:22:28,783 --> 00:22:30,685
This has to be it. Let's go.

361
00:22:31,351 --> 00:22:32,452
Val.

362
00:22:33,855 --> 00:22:36,257
- Where's Val?
- I don't know. She was just here.

363
00:22:36,389 --> 00:22:37,490
Val!

364
00:22:39,126 --> 00:22:40,027
Val.

365
00:22:44,098 --> 00:22:44,999
Help!

366
00:22:46,567 --> 00:22:47,500
Beth!

367
00:22:54,342 --> 00:22:55,810
Beth!

368
00:23:00,348 --> 00:23:01,448
Val.

369
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,288
- No.
- Beth!

370
00:23:07,420 --> 00:23:09,389
Oh, my God.

371
00:23:12,827 --> 00:23:14,996
Val.

372
00:23:15,529 --> 00:23:17,331
Val!

373
00:23:17,464 --> 00:23:18,599
Val!

374
00:23:20,101 --> 00:23:21,434
Where are you?

375
00:23:22,703 --> 00:23:25,405
Oh, my God! Dave, she's in here!

376
00:23:26,507 --> 00:23:28,910
It's, uh... It's... It's locked.

377
00:23:29,043 --> 00:23:30,477
- Lift... Lift the lever.
- What?

378
00:23:30,611 --> 00:23:31,946
Hold on, let me put this down.

379
00:23:42,056 --> 00:23:43,958
- Val.
- -Let's go, come on, let's go!

380
00:23:44,424 --> 00:23:47,295
Come on, we gotta go. Get up,
get up!

381
00:23:47,427 --> 00:23:50,031
They've turned on the lights.
Shit, someone's here.

382
00:24:01,509 --> 00:24:03,010
Shit. Oh, my God.

383
00:24:03,978 --> 00:24:05,713
Let's go. Let's go!

384
00:24:07,315 --> 00:24:08,215
Wait.

385
00:24:32,974 --> 00:24:34,241
Where the fuck is John?

386
00:24:34,976 --> 00:24:36,777
John!

387
00:24:36,911 --> 00:24:38,179
What are you doing?

388
00:24:39,580 --> 00:24:40,915
Hurry up!

389
00:24:42,817 --> 00:24:46,120
Get in the car, get in the car!

390
00:24:51,058 --> 00:24:53,327
Hurry up, hurry up. Let's go,
let's go! We need to go!

391
00:24:54,662 --> 00:24:56,897
Go, please, go, please, go.

392
00:24:59,166 --> 00:25:01,335
It's okay.

393
00:25:02,003 --> 00:25:03,471
It's okay, it's okay, calm down.

394
00:25:06,574 --> 00:25:09,210
It's okay, it's okay. Hey, hey.

395
00:25:10,111 --> 00:25:11,846
- What did you see?
- I saw him.

396
00:25:11,979 --> 00:25:13,748
- Saw whom?
- I saw him, saw him.

397
00:25:13,881 --> 00:25:16,350
- It was Mr. Creep.
- Oh, come on.

398
00:25:16,884 --> 00:25:19,353
John, screw you.
You had one job back there.

399
00:25:19,487 --> 00:25:21,355
- Why were you even in the building?
- -I went in there

400
00:25:21,489 --> 00:25:24,191
to look for you guys! You
were gone for, like, 20 minutes.

401
00:25:24,325 --> 00:25:25,726
Just give her some space.

402
00:25:26,293 --> 00:25:28,896
Val, calm down,
calm down, it's okay.

403
00:25:29,797 --> 00:25:31,665
- Did you see him?
- He's real.

404
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:34,268
- He's real.
- He's there. He's real.

405
00:25:36,137 --> 00:25:38,572
It's okay. You just...
You just calm down.

406
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:44,912
I saw Mr. Creep.
He's real. I saw him.

407
00:25:45,046 --> 00:25:49,016
No, he's real. He's real.

408
00:26:01,629 --> 00:26:03,697
So nobody's heard from Val?

409
00:26:04,398 --> 00:26:06,734
I texted her that we were meeting
here at 9:00, and she replied

410
00:26:06,867 --> 00:26:09,470
with a smiley face,
so I assume she got it.

411
00:26:09,603 --> 00:26:10,539
Okay.

412
00:26:10,671 --> 00:26:12,873
Let's start this.

413
00:26:13,240 --> 00:26:14,708
All right.. Okay.

414
00:26:15,876 --> 00:26:19,548
This is most of what we found
at the old police station.

415
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:21,849
We have some old DV tapes,

416
00:26:21,982 --> 00:26:25,019
some pictures
from the crime scenes,

417
00:26:25,453 --> 00:26:27,955
and these VHS tapes.

418
00:26:30,724 --> 00:26:35,496
And from what we read, he died
from lethal injection back in 2002.

419
00:26:36,030 --> 00:26:42,269
And I guess his calling card was filming
victims in weird, doing weird things,

420
00:26:42,870 --> 00:26:44,638
and he would broadcast those.

421
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:47,208
So, uh...

422
00:26:47,341 --> 00:26:52,313
Luckily, Dave had a DV camera,
so we can see what's on these tapes.

423
00:26:57,985 --> 00:26:59,019
Here we go.

424
00:27:14,268 --> 00:27:17,238
We know there's more than
the 20 bodies that we found.

425
00:27:18,540 --> 00:27:22,042
We've estimated the number
to be around 200.

426
00:27:23,043 --> 00:27:24,945
Does that number
sound right, Joe?

427
00:27:26,380 --> 00:27:31,018
Two hundred innocent mothers,
fathers, and children.

428
00:27:32,953 --> 00:27:34,955
Even your own son.

429
00:27:40,529 --> 00:27:41,862
My son...

430
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:45,900
...was a required sacrifice.

431
00:27:48,869 --> 00:27:50,070
Required of who?

432
00:27:51,872 --> 00:27:53,874
God.

433
00:27:54,975 --> 00:27:56,277
God told you to do this?

434
00:27:56,744 --> 00:27:57,845
Yes.

435
00:27:58,547 --> 00:27:59,446
Why?

436
00:28:03,784 --> 00:28:05,986
I was to kill my son...

437
00:28:07,087 --> 00:28:08,856
...to prove my loyalty.

438
00:28:10,391 --> 00:28:11,425
After that...

439
00:28:12,493 --> 00:28:14,361
...I was to kill 200 people.

440
00:28:16,330 --> 00:28:19,200
Then...
I was to kill my family...

441
00:28:20,701 --> 00:28:22,036
...my entire family,

442
00:28:22,671 --> 00:28:24,772
and then kill myself...

443
00:28:24,905 --> 00:28:28,209
...and I would become God.

444
00:28:29,443 --> 00:28:30,344
I see.

445
00:28:31,745 --> 00:28:34,215
Does God talk to you every day?

446
00:28:38,687 --> 00:28:42,089
He's talking to me right now.

447
00:28:43,357 --> 00:28:44,291
What is he saying?

448
00:28:46,026 --> 00:28:48,829
He's got a new list for me.

449
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:53,133
A new list of people to kill.

450
00:28:55,670 --> 00:28:56,837
And who's that?

451
00:29:02,843 --> 00:29:03,944
Beth.

452
00:29:05,614 --> 00:29:07,582
- What did he say?
- I don't know. Nothing.

453
00:29:07,915 --> 00:29:08,849
Did he say "Beth"?

454
00:29:09,450 --> 00:29:11,885
- No.
- He said, "Beth."

455
00:29:12,453 --> 00:29:14,522
Let me rewind it.

456
00:29:28,570 --> 00:29:30,337
It's gone. The video's gone.

457
00:29:30,471 --> 00:29:32,106
It's a really old tape.

458
00:29:32,439 --> 00:29:33,374
Try another one.

459
00:29:38,112 --> 00:29:39,313
Okay. Here.

460
00:29:43,917 --> 00:29:45,019
Try this one.

461
00:30:49,283 --> 00:30:50,984
That's enough tapes for today.

462
00:30:53,954 --> 00:30:57,191
- Have you guys gone through all this stuff yet?
- -Okay.

463
00:30:59,761 --> 00:31:00,662
No.

464
00:31:03,063 --> 00:31:04,632
Looks like he had a pen pal.

465
00:31:06,266 --> 00:31:08,135
That's an address
not too far from here.

466
00:31:09,069 --> 00:31:10,938
You're not thinking
of going there.

467
00:31:11,271 --> 00:31:13,407
She could have some
real information on this guy.

468
00:31:13,541 --> 00:31:15,610
We're still waiting
to hear back from Val.

469
00:31:16,611 --> 00:31:17,612
Let me see.

470
00:31:18,212 --> 00:31:20,314
- She gotten back to you?
- No, nothing.

471
00:31:21,783 --> 00:31:23,484
Let's just go.

472
00:31:56,917 --> 00:31:59,453
I was very surprised
when you called.

473
00:31:59,821 --> 00:32:04,659
It's been years since I was so deep
into that story, everything going on.

474
00:32:05,627 --> 00:32:08,362
I even had a book about him
ready for release...

475
00:32:09,196 --> 00:32:13,133
...but the FBI wouldn't let me
release it without giving me trouble.

476
00:32:13,735 --> 00:32:15,035
So it was true?

477
00:32:15,703 --> 00:32:17,906
The town was covering up
this serial killer.

478
00:32:18,038 --> 00:32:20,040
Oh, yeah.

479
00:32:20,174 --> 00:32:22,844
I believe it was very political.

480
00:32:23,645 --> 00:32:26,947
No mayor wants
a serial killer on their books

481
00:32:27,080 --> 00:32:29,517
who's killed 200 people.

482
00:32:31,051 --> 00:32:35,189
But there's a more interesting
story under all that.

483
00:32:35,322 --> 00:32:37,525
- Like what?
- Joe.

484
00:32:38,492 --> 00:32:39,694
Joe Yates.

485
00:32:40,194 --> 00:32:41,462
That was his name.

486
00:32:42,630 --> 00:32:47,234
Just normal family man
with a boring job...

487
00:32:48,035 --> 00:32:50,237
...had a terrible childhood.

488
00:32:51,305 --> 00:32:52,406
How so?

489
00:32:53,240 --> 00:32:54,174
Well,

490
00:32:54,576 --> 00:32:56,544
his parents were pretty cruel.

491
00:32:57,344 --> 00:32:59,112
They wouldn't let him
have any friends,

492
00:32:59,246 --> 00:33:02,082
wouldn't even let him
leave the house.

493
00:33:02,851 --> 00:33:06,053
Sometimes,
they took turns beating him...

494
00:33:07,020 --> 00:33:08,355
...and then one day...

495
00:33:09,189 --> 00:33:11,258
...the parents just vanished.

496
00:33:12,594 --> 00:33:15,462
Lots of people had rough
childhoods, myself included,

497
00:33:15,597 --> 00:33:18,633
and we didn't end up
as mass murderers.

498
00:33:20,067 --> 00:33:22,336
He was... Were you starved?

499
00:33:23,538 --> 00:33:26,440
Beaten with a stick
covered with thorns?

500
00:33:28,008 --> 00:33:29,476
Force-fed bleach?

501
00:33:29,978 --> 00:33:33,715
Locked in
pitch-black closets for weeks?

502
00:33:36,483 --> 00:33:38,218
And what about his face?

503
00:33:38,352 --> 00:33:39,888
Why did he have that...

504
00:33:40,387 --> 00:33:42,991
- Like, clown...?
- Like a clown?

505
00:33:43,123 --> 00:33:46,026
Like a clown.

506
00:33:46,895 --> 00:33:50,097
He wore the clown mask as a kid

507
00:33:50,230 --> 00:33:53,100
to escape
from the real world, I suppose.

508
00:33:54,134 --> 00:33:58,706
His mother saw
how much he loved it...

509
00:33:59,439 --> 00:34:01,475
...so she burned it

510
00:34:01,609 --> 00:34:04,278
while he was still wearing it.

511
00:34:05,713 --> 00:34:09,617
- Wow.
- -The doctors tried to take it off...

512
00:34:11,553 --> 00:34:14,187
...but it'd already fused
to his face.

513
00:34:16,356 --> 00:34:18,726
How do you know
so much about him?

514
00:34:19,961 --> 00:34:21,361
I've met with him...

515
00:34:22,597 --> 00:34:24,699
...many, many times
at the prison.

516
00:34:26,801 --> 00:34:28,268
He trusted me.

517
00:34:30,237 --> 00:34:33,741
To many,
he was a murderer, a killer...

518
00:34:35,208 --> 00:34:36,343
...but to me...

519
00:34:39,881 --> 00:34:41,114
I believe...

520
00:34:42,617 --> 00:34:45,085
...most monsters are not born.

521
00:34:46,219 --> 00:34:49,791
They're made by evil parents.

522
00:34:57,065 --> 00:34:58,231
And you two...

523
00:34:59,299 --> 00:35:01,736
...with that camera
and everything, wh...

524
00:35:02,135 --> 00:35:04,271
What story
are you hoping to tell?

525
00:35:05,205 --> 00:35:06,708
We just wanna tell the truth.

526
00:35:07,107 --> 00:35:10,410
We think the people of this town
should know what really happened.

527
00:35:11,144 --> 00:35:15,717
Especially the people that still have
loved ones that went missing, you know.

528
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:17,652
They deserve answers.

529
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,788
Oh, yes, answers.

530
00:35:22,056 --> 00:35:23,558
Well...

531
00:35:26,761 --> 00:35:30,632
If the truth is what you seek,
you came to the right place.

532
00:35:31,866 --> 00:35:34,134
I wanna give you something
before you leave.

533
00:35:35,036 --> 00:35:38,640
The manuscript to the book
I was going to release.

534
00:35:39,439 --> 00:35:43,044
It has every detail
I could collect from Joe.

535
00:35:43,611 --> 00:35:45,345
That would be amazing.

536
00:35:45,479 --> 00:35:47,815
- Thank you so much.
- No problem.

537
00:35:49,349 --> 00:35:51,786
No point in wasting a book.

538
00:35:53,588 --> 00:35:57,324
Give me a minute,
and I'll go dig it up.

539
00:35:57,992 --> 00:35:58,893
Thank you.

540
00:36:12,974 --> 00:36:16,577
Yeah, I'm getting some major
serial killer sympathy from her.

541
00:36:17,512 --> 00:36:18,913
This is pretty nasty.

542
00:36:21,481 --> 00:36:22,717
It's a nice place though.

543
00:36:27,220 --> 00:36:28,022
John!

544
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:34,028
- Beth.
- Evil!

545
00:36:34,494 --> 00:36:36,964
He's a good man!

546
00:36:46,507 --> 00:36:47,608
What do we do?

547
00:36:50,812 --> 00:36:51,746
What do we do?

548
00:36:54,882 --> 00:36:57,819
No, not <i>we, you.</i>
You hit her with a cane.

549
00:36:58,285 --> 00:36:59,787
T... Trying to save you!

550
00:37:02,156 --> 00:37:03,256
What the fuck?

551
00:37:03,658 --> 00:37:05,193
Go.

552
00:37:05,325 --> 00:37:06,561
Let's go!

553
00:37:12,100 --> 00:37:15,302
- What the fuck?
- Go, go, go!

554
00:37:26,313 --> 00:37:27,715
What's with the doll?

555
00:37:30,118 --> 00:37:31,953
It's not a doll.

556
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:39,761
It's a...

557
00:37:42,096 --> 00:37:43,363
...relic.

558
00:37:44,297 --> 00:37:45,566
Where did you find it?

559
00:37:47,168 --> 00:37:50,972
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

560
00:37:52,106 --> 00:37:54,041
It, uh, it...

561
00:37:55,308 --> 00:37:56,744
...found me.

562
00:38:04,752 --> 00:38:06,053
Here.

563
00:38:06,587 --> 00:38:08,089
- Take off the Band-Aid.
- Yeah.

564
00:38:08,990 --> 00:38:10,892
- It looks like it's gonna need stitches.
- -Okay.

565
00:38:11,025 --> 00:38:12,627
Well, just put something on.
It's fine.

566
00:38:13,493 --> 00:38:17,698
- The hell was that back there?
- I don't know anymore. It's just...

567
00:38:18,633 --> 00:38:20,601
I mean, we just saw
a knife go through an old lady.

568
00:38:20,735 --> 00:38:21,736
- I...
- Was I the only one that saw that?

569
00:38:21,869 --> 00:38:23,470
No, but she was...

570
00:38:23,604 --> 00:38:25,640
She was standing there.

571
00:38:25,773 --> 00:38:27,809
I mean, don't be stupid.
You saw her get up.

572
00:38:28,441 --> 00:38:29,811
What do you want me to do?

573
00:38:30,645 --> 00:38:31,979
Did you try Val again?

574
00:38:44,292 --> 00:38:45,193
Anything?

575
00:38:45,626 --> 00:38:47,460
Voicemail.
I don't know.

576
00:38:47,595 --> 00:38:49,030
Let's just go
straight over there.

577
00:40:18,451 --> 00:40:20,054
Oh, my God!

578
00:40:20,187 --> 00:40:23,291
He's here, he's here.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my...

579
00:40:28,729 --> 00:40:31,699
Ah! Oh, oh, my God!
He's here, he's here, he's here.

580
00:40:31,832 --> 00:40:33,433
Oh, my God. He's here, he's...

581
00:40:33,567 --> 00:40:37,571
Oh, my fucking God,
fucking mother!

582
00:40:37,705 --> 00:40:39,540
Oh, my God!

583
00:40:39,674 --> 00:40:42,176
He...

584
00:40:47,782 --> 00:40:49,684
Val, open up. We need to talk.

585
00:40:51,619 --> 00:40:53,521
Try the... Yeah.

586
00:40:54,722 --> 00:40:55,856
Okay, hold on.

587
00:40:57,658 --> 00:40:59,459
Hold on a second.

588
00:41:00,728 --> 00:41:01,862
I think we got it.

589
00:41:03,764 --> 00:41:05,099
What the hell
has she been doing?

590
00:41:05,232 --> 00:41:07,034
It looks like
she's been trying to find out

591
00:41:07,168 --> 00:41:08,936
where the broadcast
is coming from.

592
00:41:10,838 --> 00:41:13,274
She's got a software
to track the signal.

593
00:41:13,407 --> 00:41:14,575
Let me see.

594
00:41:17,178 --> 00:41:19,847
- Here.
- -It's like 30 minutes away.

595
00:41:20,614 --> 00:41:22,016
Do you think she went there?

596
00:41:22,683 --> 00:41:23,751
Her car's not here.

597
00:41:24,285 --> 00:41:25,786
Fuck. We shouldn't
have left her alone.

598
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:27,421
I knew she wasn't okay.

599
00:41:27,822 --> 00:41:29,523
- We have to go find her.
- Now?

600
00:41:29,657 --> 00:41:31,092
Yes, now! We have to find her,

601
00:41:31,225 --> 00:41:33,493
- and keep this going.
- Keep what going?

602
00:41:33,627 --> 00:41:37,064
This stupid video? Val is
missing. We need to call the cops.

603
00:41:37,465 --> 00:41:41,369
Call the cops? They won't do
anything for 48 hours, and then what?

604
00:41:41,501 --> 00:41:44,071
We tell 'em, we killed an old
lady, and she came back to life?

605
00:41:44,205 --> 00:41:46,374
- No, <i>you</i> killed an old lady.
- I...

606
00:41:47,441 --> 00:41:51,412
Val is fine. We need to find
her, and keep filming everything.

607
00:41:51,846 --> 00:41:53,347
For what?

608
00:41:54,081 --> 00:41:58,119
Look, I know it sounds crazy,
but when, when this is all over,

609
00:41:58,252 --> 00:42:03,024
and Val is safe, we are going
to have film history on our hands.

610
00:42:03,157 --> 00:42:07,561
I think you guys have
lost your fucking minds.

611
00:42:07,695 --> 00:42:10,464
Now, if you wanna go running
through the woods, be my guest.

612
00:42:10,598 --> 00:42:13,267
But I'm done with this shit.
I'm not doing it anymore.

613
00:42:26,547 --> 00:42:29,617
He's always gonna be there.
He's always gonna be there. He's...

614
00:42:29,750 --> 00:42:31,552
He's always gonna find...

615
00:42:38,492 --> 00:42:39,627
No...

616
00:42:47,968 --> 00:42:49,437
I don't know...

617
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:53,240
I don't know what to do.
I don't know what to do.

618
00:42:53,974 --> 00:42:56,043
I don't know what to do.

619
00:43:04,151 --> 00:43:06,087
He's gonna... He...

620
00:43:06,220 --> 00:43:07,188
He's gonna...

621
00:43:10,391 --> 00:43:11,859
He... He don't...

622
00:43:18,699 --> 00:43:20,601
I don't know what to do.

623
00:43:21,368 --> 00:43:22,670
I don't know where to go.

624
00:43:22,803 --> 00:43:24,738
He's gonna find me.
He's gonna...

625
00:43:34,549 --> 00:43:35,783
I don't know.

626
00:44:11,886 --> 00:44:12,987
John.

627
00:44:13,954 --> 00:44:15,624
We need to go now.

628
00:44:20,928 --> 00:44:23,430
Okay. We don't know
who or what is out there.

629
00:44:23,565 --> 00:44:26,233
Our main goal is to find Val
and bring her back.

630
00:44:27,301 --> 00:44:30,738
Each of us is going to have
a video camera and a flashlight,

631
00:44:30,871 --> 00:44:32,541
so that we can see
what we're filming.

632
00:44:32,940 --> 00:44:35,544
Uh, John,
did you check Google Maps?

633
00:44:35,676 --> 00:44:37,845
Uh, yeah, but it was too hard
to make anything out.

634
00:44:37,978 --> 00:44:39,446
It's mostly covered by trees.

635
00:44:39,947 --> 00:44:42,283
Okay, when we get there,
we're gonna split up into three.

636
00:44:42,816 --> 00:44:45,686
And I brought these, just...

637
00:44:45,819 --> 00:44:50,324
If you find something, if you
need help, just give it a blow,

638
00:44:50,457 --> 00:44:53,727
and we should be able to hear it
from up to half a mile away.

639
00:44:53,861 --> 00:44:55,062
Dave.

640
00:44:56,363 --> 00:44:57,264
It works.

641
00:44:57,998 --> 00:44:59,400
All right.

642
00:45:02,803 --> 00:45:05,940
What happens if we see him?

643
00:45:06,707 --> 00:45:07,841
Then we run.

644
00:46:45,906 --> 00:46:47,174
Just keep driving.

645
00:47:10,699 --> 00:47:11,899
I'm so scared.

646
00:47:33,688 --> 00:47:34,589
What the f...?

647
00:47:35,222 --> 00:47:36,357
It is him.

648
00:47:42,196 --> 00:47:43,297
What the f...?

649
00:47:46,568 --> 00:47:48,135
- I, I can't.
- John, turn on the lights!

650
00:47:48,268 --> 00:47:49,903
- Turn on the fucking lights!
- I can't!

651
00:47:51,372 --> 00:47:53,474
Let's get out!

652
00:47:54,041 --> 00:47:56,310
Oh, my God!

653
00:48:09,423 --> 00:48:10,324
Val!

654
00:48:10,891 --> 00:48:13,193
Val!

655
00:48:15,162 --> 00:48:17,231
Okay, I got my whistle.

656
00:48:22,871 --> 00:48:24,572
Fuck! Are you kidding me?

657
00:48:25,707 --> 00:48:26,508
Fuck.

658
00:48:26,641 --> 00:48:27,575
John!

659
00:48:27,709 --> 00:48:30,043
Beth!

660
00:48:31,613 --> 00:48:32,514
Beth!

661
00:48:34,314 --> 00:48:36,917
I... I don't see her anywhere.

662
00:48:38,252 --> 00:48:39,687
Where should we go?
Should we ju...

663
00:48:40,421 --> 00:48:42,122
I thought we parked around here.

664
00:48:44,191 --> 00:48:45,426
Are you sure this is it?

665
00:48:45,926 --> 00:48:47,127
I s...

666
00:48:49,396 --> 00:48:52,966
What, what if this,
what if this was Val?

667
00:48:54,067 --> 00:48:55,202
The whole thing is...

668
00:48:55,335 --> 00:48:56,437
What if it was Val?

669
00:48:57,070 --> 00:48:58,338
No man, she wouldn't do that.

670
00:48:59,106 --> 00:49:02,577
From day one, she's
been leading us on this thing.

671
00:49:04,846 --> 00:49:06,480
She's the one
who knew about the murder.

672
00:49:06,614 --> 00:49:08,015
She's the one
who showed us the video.

673
00:49:08,148 --> 00:49:09,082
She's the one
who had the location.

674
00:49:09,216 --> 00:49:10,484
We're the ones who followed her.

675
00:49:11,985 --> 00:49:13,555
Now we can't find
the fucking car.

676
00:49:17,157 --> 00:49:18,025
Is that Beth?

677
00:49:21,428 --> 00:49:22,329
Beth!

678
00:49:23,163 --> 00:49:25,065
- Beth!
- John, wait.

679
00:49:26,868 --> 00:49:28,235
Come on, man, wait up.

680
00:49:33,040 --> 00:49:34,141
John!

681
00:49:45,653 --> 00:49:47,622
John!

682
00:49:56,898 --> 00:49:58,098
Oh, my God. Dave!

683
00:49:58,633 --> 00:50:00,935
- Dave, what happened? Where's John?
- I don't know.

684
00:50:01,068 --> 00:50:03,303
He tried to come find you
after he heard your whistle.

685
00:50:03,437 --> 00:50:05,005
My whistle? It's broken.

686
00:50:05,138 --> 00:50:06,273
It doesn't work.

687
00:50:07,341 --> 00:50:08,943
God.
Let's just keep going.

688
00:50:09,076 --> 00:50:11,646
We need to go up this river, and
the farm should be right there.

689
00:50:12,045 --> 00:50:15,048
No, Beth, I think we need to
find John, and then get out of here.

690
00:50:16,283 --> 00:50:17,284
It's okay, John's fine.

691
00:50:17,417 --> 00:50:19,186
We just need to stick together.

692
00:50:20,120 --> 00:50:21,455
What is that?

693
00:50:22,022 --> 00:50:23,658
- Oh, my God.
- Is that a body?

694
00:50:26,861 --> 00:50:28,161
Oh, my God.

695
00:50:28,295 --> 00:50:30,598
Yeah. Okay.

696
00:50:34,134 --> 00:50:36,638
And the bodies,
where did you put the bodies?

697
00:50:37,539 --> 00:50:39,373
Just give us a location, Joe.

698
00:50:40,274 --> 00:50:41,408
Bodies?

699
00:50:42,376 --> 00:50:44,012
Yes. Where are they buried?

700
00:50:47,347 --> 00:50:49,817
Sacred ground.

701
00:50:50,952 --> 00:50:51,819
Joe, come on.

702
00:50:52,787 --> 00:50:54,956
The bodies
belong to the families.

703
00:50:55,557 --> 00:50:57,124
They deserve to rest in peace.

704
00:50:57,257 --> 00:50:58,325
Don't you agree?

705
00:50:59,159 --> 00:51:00,260
No.

706
00:51:01,228 --> 00:51:04,264
Their bodies,

707
00:51:04,398 --> 00:51:05,633
their souls...

708
00:51:06,868 --> 00:51:08,335
...belong to me.

709
00:51:29,089 --> 00:51:30,190
Beth!

710
00:51:35,095 --> 00:51:37,164
Beth?

711
00:51:40,300 --> 00:51:41,501
I'm sorry, guys.

712
00:51:45,039 --> 00:51:45,873
What the fu...?

713
00:52:04,092 --> 00:52:05,292
Hurry up!

714
00:52:16,971 --> 00:52:19,239
Oh, God, Beth, no,
we need to get out of here.

715
00:52:19,373 --> 00:52:20,875
It's a fucking crime scene.

716
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:27,314
Is that Val?

717
00:52:29,984 --> 00:52:31,619
- She has to be around here somewhere.
- Where?

718
00:52:32,020 --> 00:52:34,022
- In a building! A building nearby!
- Okay...

719
00:52:34,154 --> 00:52:35,790
Val! Val! Oh.

720
00:52:37,257 --> 00:52:38,492
Val!

721
00:52:42,229 --> 00:52:43,798
Okay. Val!

722
00:52:46,500 --> 00:52:48,468
Oh, my God. What the fuck?

723
00:52:49,236 --> 00:52:50,337
Val.

724
00:52:50,805 --> 00:52:51,673
Val.

725
00:52:53,407 --> 00:52:54,509
Is that you?

726
00:52:56,577 --> 00:52:58,245
Val? Hey!

727
00:53:00,748 --> 00:53:02,884
Val.

728
00:53:26,107 --> 00:53:27,340
Hey, Val.

729
00:53:29,911 --> 00:53:30,945
Val!

730
00:53:37,919 --> 00:53:38,953
Hey, Val.

731
00:53:50,131 --> 00:53:51,599
What is wrong with...

732
00:54:24,165 --> 00:54:25,265
What?

733
00:54:26,100 --> 00:54:27,001
Dave?

734
00:54:28,435 --> 00:54:29,670
What the fuck?

735
00:54:31,304 --> 00:54:33,373
What is this?

736
00:54:33,508 --> 00:54:35,442
Help! Somebody!

737
00:54:36,210 --> 00:54:37,078
Help me!

738
00:54:37,612 --> 00:54:40,581
No, no, no! Help me!

739
00:54:41,048 --> 00:54:42,150
Dave!

740
00:54:42,282 --> 00:54:43,383
Dave!

741
00:54:46,988 --> 00:54:49,690
Oh, my God.

742
00:54:52,059 --> 00:54:52,960
Somebody.

743
00:54:53,828 --> 00:54:56,097
Help! Help!

744
00:55:09,911 --> 00:55:11,813
Okay. Okay.

745
00:55:23,356 --> 00:55:24,992
My G... Okay.

746
00:56:12,039 --> 00:56:14,308
Oh, my God. Okay.

747
00:56:19,947 --> 00:56:20,948
What...

748
00:56:21,515 --> 00:56:22,683
What is this?

749
00:56:23,985 --> 00:56:24,919
Oh, my God.

750
00:56:27,955 --> 00:56:28,856
Dave.

751
00:56:29,624 --> 00:56:31,592
Dave! Keep whistling!

752
00:56:34,461 --> 00:56:35,462
Dave.

753
00:56:35,596 --> 00:56:39,033
Dave. Whistle. Keep whistling.

754
00:56:39,466 --> 00:56:41,736
Dave! Oh, my God.

755
00:56:43,871 --> 00:56:47,541
I'm sorry. I... I'll come back
for you, okay? I'll come...

756
00:56:47,675 --> 00:56:50,044
I'm sorry. I'll come back.

757
00:56:56,416 --> 00:56:57,752
I'll come, I'll come.

758
00:57:14,635 --> 00:57:15,670
Thank God.

759
00:57:16,837 --> 00:57:17,972
Thank God.

760
00:57:42,296 --> 00:57:46,734
I just want you to know you've
committed some very serious crimes here.

761
00:57:47,969 --> 00:57:50,438
Crimes this country
has never seen before.

762
00:57:51,005 --> 00:57:53,774
There's a very high chance
you'll get the death penalty.

763
00:57:54,642 --> 00:57:55,843
Does that worry you?

764
00:57:59,914 --> 00:58:00,815
No.

765
00:58:01,282 --> 00:58:02,149
Why?

766
00:58:04,585 --> 00:58:07,487
God has promised me
eternal life.

767
00:58:08,422 --> 00:58:10,224
God doesn't help killers.

768
00:58:16,530 --> 00:58:17,965
My God is...

769
00:58:20,434 --> 00:58:21,569
...different.

770
00:58:25,773 --> 00:58:27,008
And why is that?

771
00:58:28,609 --> 00:58:32,713
Oh, I am God.
