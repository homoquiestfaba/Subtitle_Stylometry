trying to get rid ofrecess again.

who wants to get rid ofrecess ?

- Okay.

explain what that Dr. Benedict is doing.

he’s not doing--

be at the restaurant all by herself.

- The girl whose name
is in here-- Luna Pergum.

822
00:50:28,005 --> 00:50:29,939
Must be some Italian chick.

- Don’tyou understand ?

825
00:50:34,511 --> 00:50:38,106
Lunaeperigeum is no lady.
It’s an event. Look.

826
00:50:38,181 --> 00:50:41,810
Once a month, the moon reaches the point
where it’s closest to the Earth--

827
00:50:41,885 --> 00:50:46,584
lunar perigee, which in this case
happens to be 1 2:22 tomorrow afternoon.

828
00:50:46,657 --> 00:50:51,253
Maybe that’s when that doctor
guy is gonna shoot his laser
at the moon and blow it up.

829
00:50:51,328 --> 00:50:53,262
Close guess,
but I have another theory.

830
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:57,790
When I was up at space camp,
I observed some abnormalities
in the moon’s position.

831
00:50:57,868 --> 00:51:01,167
I couldn’t figure out what was
causing it, but now it all makes sense.

832
00:51:01,238 --> 00:51:05,334
Dr. Benedict’s device is not a
laser beam at all. It’s a tractor beam !

833
00:51:05,409 --> 00:51:09,072
You mean he’s gonna plow the moon’s
surface ? Whateverwill he plant ?

834
00:51:09,146 --> 00:51:11,774
Not a tractor, you goombah.

00:51:15,752 --> 00:51:17,686
Theoretically,
ifa powerful tractor beam...

838

were shot at the moon
exactly at lunar perigee,

839
00:51:20,757 --> 00:51:22,952
it could move the moon
into another orbit.

840
00:51:23,026 --> 00:51:25,961

would anybodywant to do that ?
