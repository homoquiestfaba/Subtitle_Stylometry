00:18:23,435 --> 00:18:25,702
       Sophie, stay in the yard
              but away from me.

445
00:18:27,173 --> 00:18:29,841
If Barnaby knocked up
some skank co-worker,

446
00:18:29,843 --> 00:18:32,477
I would do to him
what the vet did to BooBoo,

447
00:18:32,479 --> 00:18:34,846
only with the pliers
and a butter knife.

448
00:18:34,848 --> 00:18:36,581
       Hi, this is not
       about you, okay?

449
00:18:36,583 --> 00:18:37,849
                This is about me

450
00:18:37,851 --> 00:18:40,218
              and how I have to
        rethink my entire life.

451
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,436
   Okay.

452

You know
what you should do?

453

write a book.

 how women are always trying

        to live up to
   these ridiculous images.

457
00:18:50,463 --> 00:18:51,796
     You always say this.
     I have no idea why.

458
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:53,331
I'm an agent.

459
00:18:53,333 --> 00:18:55,566
I think you're interesting
and I could make money.

Ooh, once again, about me.
Yay!

Okay, I don't know if
you're ready to hear this

 but I'm gonna tell you anyway.

463
00:18:59,706 --> 00:19:02,773
You need just to get out there
and find yourself a real man.

464
00:19:02,775 --> 00:19:04,909
     I don't want anyone to see
                my grab handles

              and my muffin top.

466

I would hurt a puppy
to lose weight.

467

 I would yell at kittens.

469
00:19:11,885 --> 00:19:13,918
I would skin a dolphin.

          I just-I never thought

471
00:19:15,288 --> 00:19:16,921
               that I was gonna
               be dating again.

472
00:19:16,923 --> 00:19:18,389
   I'm like a born again virgin.

473
00:19:18,391 --> 00:19:19,824
        I don't know what to do
               on a first date.

00:19:19,826 --> 00:19:21,259
               Do you have sex?
                  I don't know.

   No.

It's like first date,
it's like first base.

477
00:19:25,632 --> 00:19:26,831
             I never knew that.
                    What is it?

478
00:19:26,833 --> 00:19:28,366
                 Is that, like,
          they touch your boob?

479
00:19:28,368 --> 00:19:31,669
           That's--
     No. It's not boobs.

480
00:19:31,671 --> 00:19:33,871
 First base is kissing.

481
00:19:33,873 --> 00:19:35,206
Okay, second base is boobs.

482
00:19:35,208 --> 00:19:36,207
     I don't think that's right.

             I bet there's been
                 sex inflation.

487
00:19:42,182 --> 00:19:43,414
      It's probably boob by now.

 No. Uh-oh.

 Ah, mm-hm.

490

 First base is kissing.

491

 Boob is second base.

492
00:19:49,589 --> 00:19:50,588
 Blow jobs are third.

                          What?

503
00:20:08,641 --> 00:20:12,810
A vagumach is when your vagina
and your stomach meet up.

504

     That's what I have.
         No, you d--

Ooh.
And you know what?

 When you're out there,

do not let yourself
get pre-issed.

                     Mmm.

514
00:20:28,677 --> 00:20:29,960
Pre-issed is when
they stop moving.

515
00:20:29,963 --> 00:20:30,962
 They just fall asleep.

00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:15,159
                           Okay.

591
00:23:15,161 --> 00:23:18,629
I want you to send in
to my lab your stool sample.

592
00:23:18,631 --> 00:23:20,715
                   Eugh.

593
00:23:20,716 --> 00:23:22,800
And most importantly,
I want you to begin each day

594
00:23:22,802 --> 00:23:26,737
by drinking two fluid ounces
of your own urine.

595
00:23:26,739 --> 00:23:28,973
                          What?
                   No. Oh, God.

596
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:30,441
          Oh, I can't, I can't,
                   I can't, no.

597
00:23:30,443 --> 00:23:31,709
Now, look,
it's simple to do this.

598
00:23:31,711 --> 00:23:33,744
All you do, most of my clients
they just take it,

599
00:23:33,746 --> 00:23:35,112
they take the two ounces,

600
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:36,479
they dump it
in their morning latté,

601
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:37,581
just chuck it down.

602
00:23:37,583 --> 00:23:38,849
Never even know
the difference.

603
00:23:38,851 --> 00:23:41,085
Others make themselves
what they call a "pee tea"

604
00:23:41,087 --> 00:23:44,088
and heat it in the kettle
on that stove.

605
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:46,524
Because Gandhi
drank his morning pee

606
00:23:46,526 --> 00:23:48,092
every single morning.

607
00:23:48,094 --> 00:23:49,527
                 Mahatma Gandhi?

608
00:23:49,529 --> 00:23:52,763
Yes, and now think back to
how thin Gandhi was.

609
00:23:52,765 --> 00:23:54,131
                      Okay.

610
00:23:54,132 --> 00:23:55,498
Hold on.
Stay on the ball.

611
00:23:55,501 --> 00:24:00,838
Now, I need you to mail me
your stool sample

612
00:24:00,840 --> 00:24:01,839
<i> in this envelope.</i>

613
00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:03,007
<i> It is self-sealing.</i>

614
00:24:03,009 --> 00:24:06,477
Do not do as many people do
and lick it.

615
00:24:06,479 --> 00:24:09,513
And this, right here,
these are your supplements.

616
00:24:09,515 --> 00:24:10,648
                    SUZANNE:
                    All right.
       Okay.

617
00:24:10,650 --> 00:24:11,733
               I'll do it.

618
00:24:11,734 --> 00:24:12,817
It really was a pleasure
to meet you.

619
00:24:12,819 --> 00:24:14,785
                     Thank you.
      It was so nice-thank you.

620
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:15,986
             I'm truly grateful.

621
00:24:15,988 --> 00:24:18,155
               Oh, look, sorry.
                 I'm just not--

622
00:24:18,157 --> 00:24:19,824
I would stand first,
but in my culture,

623
00:24:19,826 --> 00:24:22,226
it's appropriate for women
to stand before men.

624
00:24:22,228 --> 00:24:24,061
          Look, I just--I'm not
 good at the ball thing but I--

625
00:24:24,063 --> 00:24:25,463
               thank you.

626
00:24:25,465 --> 00:24:26,864
Thank you so much.
I'm really grateful.

627
00:24:28,167 --> 00:24:29,200
       Mmm.

628
00:24:29,202 --> 00:24:31,635
You will be pretty someday.

629
00:24:34,841 --> 00:24:38,008
  It's our new house, buddy.
      What do you think?

630
00:24:38,010 --> 00:24:39,610
   Want to give Mommy kisses?

631
00:24:39,612 --> 00:24:41,779
   BooBoo, give Mommy a kiss.

632
00:24:41,781 --> 00:24:43,948
      Oh, there's a kissy.

633
00:24:43,950 --> 00:24:45,549
    Oh, not with the tongue.

634
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:46,817
   That's confusing to Mommy.

635
00:24:46,819 --> 00:24:47,885
           Oh, yeah.

636
00:24:54,093 --> 00:24:55,893
  Come on, you son of a bitch.

637
00:25:10,243 --> 00:25:12,142
           Oh, Jesus.

638
00:25:12,144 --> 00:25:15,980
        Here, let me.
           No, no.

639
00:25:15,982 --> 00:25:17,147
    I'm so sorry.

640
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:18,782
That was so weird.
I just--

641
00:25:18,784 --> 00:25:21,986
I have this thing where, like,
if I don't see it go in,

642
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:24,188
I just Gaslight myself,

643
00:25:24,190 --> 00:25:26,056
like this old
black and white movie.

644
00:25:26,058 --> 00:25:29,894
      Yeah, where Charles Boyer
   tries to make Ingrid Bergman

645
00:25:29,896 --> 00:25:31,795
      think she's crazy.
             Yes.

646
00:25:31,797 --> 00:25:33,898
    I love that movie.

647
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,733
  Me too.

648
00:25:35,735 --> 00:25:37,635
                      I thought
          I was the only person

649
00:25:37,637 --> 00:25:40,538
       who Gaslights themselves
                at the mailbox.

650
00:25:40,540 --> 00:25:41,972
 I totally do that.

651
00:25:41,974 --> 00:25:44,141
     It's just some stupid crap
                I have to send,

652
00:25:44,143 --> 00:25:46,143
                I'm treating it
                like it's gold.

653
00:25:46,145 --> 00:25:48,145
            Did it go in there?
                    Am I crazy?

654
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:51,615
 Yeah, it's just some crap.

655
00:25:54,921 --> 00:25:56,287
  Thank you.

656
00:25:56,289 --> 00:25:57,621
                 You're welcome.

657
00:25:58,991 --> 00:26:00,024
    Morning.

658
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:01,091
     ( GIGGLING )
     See ya.

659
00:26:03,829 --> 00:26:07,631
Decaf, double shot,
no foam, skinny latté

660
00:26:07,633 --> 00:26:10,134
with extra room like
you asked for it three times

661
00:26:10,136 --> 00:26:12,336
even though I heard you
the first time.

662
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:13,704
                 Thank you.

663
00:26:18,678 --> 00:26:20,210
      Oh no, you don't.
            What?
           I-what?

664
00:26:20,212 --> 00:26:21,679
JAROD:<i> I saw what you poured</i>
<i> in that.</i>

665
00:26:21,681 --> 00:26:24,615
That is a decaf, non-fat,
skinny pee pee latté.

666
00:26:24,617 --> 00:26:25,749
                   How on earth
             did you even know?

667
00:26:25,751 --> 00:26:27,017
I run a coffee shop
in West L.A.

668
00:26:27,019 --> 00:26:29,887
I see every crazy diet fad
that comes in here

669
00:26:29,889 --> 00:26:32,156
and that Gregory tells people
to spend $300

670
00:26:32,158 --> 00:26:33,791
to drink their own urine?

671
00:26:33,793 --> 00:26:35,025
I mean, no wonder
they lose weight.

672
00:26:35,027 --> 00:26:37,361
They go through the day
too disgusted to eat.

673
00:26:37,363 --> 00:26:39,163
               They lose weight?

674
00:26:39,165 --> 00:26:41,098
Seriously,
that's all you heard

675
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:42,666
 from what I just said?

676
00:26:42,668 --> 00:26:44,168
All right, I'm gonna
make you another latté.

677
00:26:44,170 --> 00:26:45,803
          Look, I--
      Oh, you know what?

678
00:26:45,805 --> 00:26:48,172
               You-that's mine.
            You've-that's mine.

679
00:26:48,174 --> 00:26:49,206
 Oh, sorry.

680
00:26:49,208 --> 00:26:52,209
Oh, no, wait a minute.
Good news.

681
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,111
We ordered exactly
the same thing.

682
00:26:54,113 --> 00:26:55,346
Here, here's mine.
I didn't touch it.

683
00:26:55,348 --> 00:26:56,914
Take that, we're fixed.

684
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:58,949
      No, it's not fixed
     because that's mine

685
00:26:58,951 --> 00:27:00,084
          and it's very special.

686
00:27:00,086 --> 00:27:01,619
 No, look, it's okay.

687
00:27:01,621 --> 00:27:04,021
I already put my fixings in
so you take that one

688
00:27:04,023 --> 00:27:05,689
and it's a win-win.

689
00:27:05,691 --> 00:27:09,259
   It's seriously not a win-win
              because it's mine

690
00:27:09,261 --> 00:27:10,694
       and I just really would--

691
00:27:10,696 --> 00:27:11,895
I know that we don't
know each other

692
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:13,364
but I'm just gonna
say something here.

693
00:27:13,366 --> 00:27:16,200
I think I understand
what you're going through.

694
00:27:16,202 --> 00:27:18,702
You are afraid of change, right?

695
00:27:18,704 --> 00:27:20,004
             No.
      Of losing control,

696
00:27:20,006 --> 00:27:23,841
so you fixate on the idea
of ownership of objects.

697
00:27:23,843 --> 00:27:25,909
You know, I'm gonna
do you a favor, okay?

698
00:27:25,911 --> 00:27:29,246
I'm taking your latté
and I'm giving you freedom.

699
00:27:29,248 --> 00:27:32,016
You're gonna thank me,
you are.

700
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,687
          Oh, mm-mm.

701
00:27:36,689 --> 00:27:38,756
I'm tasting your freedom.

702
00:27:38,758 --> 00:27:41,158
              So not my freedom
                you're tasting.

 And we are back.

Now, ladies,
I would like to ask

731
00:29:04,076 --> 00:29:06,844
how you feel about
the current epidemic

732
00:29:06,846 --> 00:29:10,481
of female self-mutilation
through plastic surgery.

733
00:29:10,483 --> 00:29:13,350
Oh, hon, count me among
the self-mutilators.

734
00:29:13,352 --> 00:29:15,352
         See my neck?
         I hated it.

     than an old redwood.

736
00:29:17,256 --> 00:29:19,089
         So I went in
    and had a nip tuck me

737
00:29:19,091 --> 00:29:20,524
       and now I love it.

738
00:29:20,526 --> 00:29:23,293
Well, Marcia,
you are an actress

739
00:29:23,295 --> 00:29:24,895
and obviously
you felt pressure

740
00:29:24,897 --> 00:29:27,331

          I gotta go.

1177
00:46:47,105 --> 00:46:48,104
            Okay.
        I'll see you.

1178
00:46:48,106 --> 00:46:51,191
    Bye, honey.

1179
00:46:51,192 --> 00:46:54,277
Ooh, remember, don't knock up
the co-workers.

1180
00:46:54,279 --> 00:46:55,278
          Don't worry.

1181
00:46:55,280 --> 00:46:57,046
      Okay.

1182
00:46:57,048 --> 00:46:57,880
        Bye.

1183
00:46:57,882 --> 00:46:59,348
                           Bye.
                  See you soon.

1184
00:47:03,021 --> 00:47:05,238
                  Okay.

1185
00:47:05,239 --> 00:47:07,456
            ( CLEARING THROAT )
       I'm getting liposuction.

1186
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:11,561
            I know it's stupid.
        I know I don't need it.

1187
00:47:11,563 --> 00:47:15,198
                I just want it.
                I just want it.

1188
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:18,334
              I want it the way
              a middle aged man

1189
00:47:18,336 --> 00:47:20,369
          wants a Mercedes Benz.

1190
00:47:22,340 --> 00:47:23,840
           So what do you think?

1191
00:47:24,976 --> 00:47:27,944
You had me at
"I'm getting liposuction."

1192

           SUZANNE

1194
00:47:40,225 --> 00:47:41,490
                 All right.

1195
00:47:41,492 --> 00:47:43,192
       I read this in Wikipedia.

1196
00:47:43,194 --> 00:47:45,962
           You can take the fat
        that you are gonna take

1197
00:47:45,964 --> 00:47:47,463
       directly out of my butt--

1198
00:47:47,465 --> 00:47:48,631
           DOCTOR:
           <i> Uh-hm.</i>

1199
00:47:48,633 --> 00:47:51,200
             And you can put it
                  into my lips.

1200
00:47:51,202 --> 00:47:57,206
         So people can actually
                   kiss my ass.

1201
00:47:57,208 --> 00:47:58,808
          ( LAUGHING )

1202
00:47:58,809 --> 00:48:00,409
Okay, so what's happening now
is the meds are kicking in.

1203
00:48:00,411 --> 00:48:01,544
                I feel good.

1204
00:48:01,546 --> 00:48:03,145
I can see that.
That's wonderful.

1205
00:48:03,147 --> 00:48:04,547
You know, we're not
gonna have this conversation,

1206
00:48:04,549 --> 00:48:06,082
       though, about--
  Can we please just do it?

1207
00:48:06,084 --> 00:48:07,250
                      I'm here.
     No, we can't please do it.

1208
00:48:07,252 --> 00:48:08,885
          I will give you money.

1209
00:48:08,887 --> 00:48:10,286
We're not gonna have the
conversation about, you know,

1210
00:48:10,288 --> 00:48:11,954
what procedures
we're gonna do or not gonna do.

1211
00:48:11,956 --> 00:48:12,955
<i> We're not gonna do that</i>
<i> right now.</i>

1212
00:48:12,957 --> 00:48:15,091
         ( CRYING ):
        Did I tell you

1213
00:48:15,093 --> 00:48:18,261
        that the woman
        that stole my husband

1214
00:48:21,032 --> 00:48:27,370
        has those lips, those--
             they're beautiful.

1215
00:48:27,372 --> 00:48:28,571
       Okay.

1216
00:48:28,573 --> 00:48:30,606
I'm gonna give you
a temporary injection

1217
00:48:30,608 --> 00:48:32,375
into your lips of saline.

1218
00:48:32,377 --> 00:48:35,645
That is going to give you
the pouf
that you're talking about.

1219
00:48:35,647 --> 00:48:37,380
          Thank you.
       It's temporary.

1220
00:48:41,653 --> 00:48:43,153
          Is that my fat?

1221
00:48:43,154 --> 00:48:44,654
DOCTOR:<i> It is your fat, yes.</i>
         SUZANNE:<i> Ahh!</i>

1222
00:48:44,656 --> 00:48:48,057
DOCTOR:<i> Say goodbye.</i>
<i> Wave goodbye to your fat.</i>

1223
00:48:48,059 --> 00:48:49,325
    SUZANNE:<i> It's yellow.</i>
      DOCTOR:<i> Yes, it is.</i>

1224
00:48:49,327 --> 00:48:50,960
      It's like butter.
            Yeah.

1225
00:48:50,962 --> 00:48:54,163
       Which is perfect because
         that's where I got it.

1226
00:48:54,165 --> 00:48:54,997
DOCTOR:
<i> Mm-hm.</i>

1227
00:48:54,999 --> 00:48:57,133
              Can I keep my fat?

1228
00:48:57,135 --> 00:48:58,701
              Can I keep it?

1229
00:48:58,702 --> 00:49:00,268
Suzanne,
if you sign a release,

1230
00:49:00,271 --> 00:49:01,604
I will give you your fat.

1231
00:49:01,606 --> 00:49:03,139
                  Oh, thank you.

1232
00:49:03,141 --> 00:49:04,941
   'Cause, God knows,
   it is your fat.

1233
00:49:04,943 --> 00:49:06,709
          Thank you.
          Thank you.

1234
00:49:06,711 --> 00:49:08,110
Yeah, keep your hands down.

1235
00:49:08,112 --> 00:49:10,346
                 That face mask
        looks so pretty on you.

   Yeah, hi, BooBoo.

00:49:26,564 --> 00:49:29,098
           Yeah.

1244
00:49:29,100 --> 00:49:30,199
             Okay.

1245
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:31,667
            Okay, okay, okay.

1246
00:49:31,669 --> 00:49:33,602
               Do not drop that.

1247
00:49:33,604 --> 00:49:35,171
         It's my fat.
          All right.

1248
00:49:35,173 --> 00:49:36,272
           I made it.

1249
00:49:36,274 --> 00:49:37,473
             I know you made it.

1250
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:38,507
              And you know what?

1251
00:49:38,509 --> 00:49:39,575
  Do we need to bring it inside?

1252
00:49:39,577 --> 00:49:41,577
                      I don't--
                    no, no, no.

1253
00:49:41,579 --> 00:49:43,279
            Aghh!
            Okay.

1254
00:49:44,282 --> 00:49:46,482

           you showed him, huh?

1255
00:49:46,484 --> 00:49:48,184
          That was Michael, huh?

 Are we home yet?

1259

          All right, here we go.

1260
00:49:57,695 --> 00:49:59,195
            Come on, here we go.

1261
00:49:59,197 --> 00:50:00,730

1265
00:50:08,606 --> 00:50:10,239
               Okay, you did it.

1266
00:50:10,241 --> 00:50:12,608
              Yay, you!

1267
00:50:12,610 --> 00:50:16,178

       let's just get this off.

1268
00:50:16,180 --> 00:50:18,047
                Okay, there.

1269

Okay, oh, wow, okay,
that's convenient, huh?

1273
00:50:29,027 --> 00:50:31,527
 Yeah. Lucky you.

1274
00:50:31,529 --> 00:50:33,629
All right.
Oh, okay, there you go.

1275
00:50:33,631 --> 00:50:34,630
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

1276
00:50:34,632 --> 00:50:35,765
I can do it,
I can do it.

1277
00:50:35,767 --> 00:50:38,501
                        I know,
         you're high as a kite.

1278
00:50:38,503 --> 00:50:39,502
           Come here.

1279
00:50:39,504 --> 00:50:40,536
                   I'm so tired.

1280
00:50:40,538 --> 00:50:42,238
 I know you're tired.

1281
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:43,639
                      Get in it.

1282
00:50:43,641 --> 00:50:45,374
                      All right.

1283
00:50:45,376 --> 00:50:46,642
                   There you go.

1284
00:50:49,213 --> 00:50:51,313
      Hey, okay.

1285
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:54,483
All right.
At that New Year's Eve party,

1286
00:50:54,485 --> 00:50:58,454
did you or did you not
sleep with John Brady?

1287
00:50:58,456 --> 00:51:00,322
                  <i> Uh-huh? Yeah.</i>

1288
00:51:00,324 --> 00:51:02,558
       I knew it.

1289
00:51:02,560 --> 00:51:04,326
 I got to call Marilyn.

1290
00:51:04,328 --> 00:51:05,494
                      I knew it.

1291
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:12,101
         KIM:<i> Hey,</i>
 <i> Suzanna-ranna-danna-banana.</i>

1293
00:51:14,305 --> 00:51:15,304
           <i> Come on.</i>

1294
00:51:18,276 --> 00:51:20,276
           Hey, Suze.

1295
00:51:20,278 --> 00:51:23,412
Did you forget you're speaking
on a panel today?

1296
00:51:24,482 --> 00:51:25,581
 Morning.

1297
00:51:26,751 --> 00:51:28,150
Oh, God.

1298
00:51:28,152 --> 00:51:29,685
 Honey, you got to get up here.

1299
00:51:29,687 --> 00:51:32,188
Okay, we got
a slight problem.

1300
00:51:32,190 --> 00:51:35,558
Just a slight problem,
but don't worry.

1301
00:51:35,560 --> 00:51:39,829
I called the doctor
and she said that it's
just an allergic reaction

1302
00:51:39,831 --> 00:51:42,298
to the lidocaine
in the saline solution.

1303
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:44,266
And that you don't need to
worry about a thing

1304
00:51:44,268 --> 00:51:46,569
  because it's gonna go down.

1305
00:51:46,571 --> 00:51:47,570
What's gonna go down?

1306
00:51:47,572 --> 00:51:49,305
It's gonna go down.

1307
00:51:50,741 --> 00:51:51,740
           Oh, my God!

1308
00:51:51,742 --> 00:51:53,409
         What happened?

1309
00:51:53,411 --> 00:51:58,447
Eventually, I mean, not today,
     but it will go down.

1310
00:51:58,449 --> 00:51:59,598
           It will.
          ( CRYING )

1311
00:51:59,599 --> 00:52:00,748
    No, don't panic,
    though, honey.

1312
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:03,219
         Don't panic.
         Don't panic.

1313
00:52:03,221 --> 00:52:04,753
      We can fix this.

1314
00:52:04,755 --> 00:52:05,754
 Accessories.

1315
00:52:05,756 --> 00:52:07,156
            What?
             Yes.

1316
00:52:07,158 --> 00:52:09,658
             No.
It's all about accessorizing.

1317
00:52:09,660 --> 00:52:10,659
        Okay, here. Huh?

1318
00:52:10,661 --> 00:52:12,294
        What? Hey.

01:05:09,640 --> 01:05:11,006
           Is that unattractive?

1611
01:05:11,008 --> 01:05:11,640
  No.

1612
01:05:11,642 --> 01:05:13,308
          ( LAUGHING )

1613
01:05:13,310 --> 01:05:16,678
      What we have to do now is
   to find someone for Cameron,

1614
01:05:16,680 --> 01:05:18,413
                     <i> you know,</i>
       <i> so that he doesn't feel</i>

1615
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:21,416
   <i> like such a third wheel</i>
<i>when we go on holiday together.</i>

1616
01:05:21,418 --> 01:05:25,587
( LAUGHING ) You all go
on holiday together, I see.

1617
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:27,055
       Trevor has a private jet.

1618
01:05:27,057 --> 01:05:29,224
       No, no, I just lease one.

1619
01:05:29,226 --> 01:05:31,493
                <i> Does the trick.</i>

1620
01:05:31,495 --> 01:05:32,694
      Wouldn't it be wonderful,
                       darling,

1621
01:05:32,696 --> 01:05:35,397
        if these two, you know,
               made a go of it?

1622
01:05:35,399 --> 01:05:37,265
          ( LAUGHING )

1623
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:38,366
       Yes.

1624
01:05:38,368 --> 01:05:40,669
    How long's it been, Cameron?

1625
01:05:40,671 --> 01:05:42,570
       Forty-four hours
      and nine minutes.

1626
01:05:42,572 --> 01:05:43,972
          ( LAUGHING )

1627
01:05:43,974 --> 01:05:45,173
                   Right, right.

1628
01:05:45,175 --> 01:05:47,575
                 Well, probably
         a bit early to say yet

1629
01:05:47,577 --> 01:05:50,412
      but here's to the success.

1630
01:05:50,414 --> 01:05:52,380
      Here's to success.
          Thank you.

1631
01:05:52,382 --> 01:05:53,381
 No pressure.

1632
01:05:53,383 --> 01:05:54,549
( LAUGHING )
Yeah.

1633
01:05:54,551 --> 01:05:56,017
It's really just
almost scary

1634
01:05:56,019 --> 01:05:57,319
how nice you people are
to each other.

1635
01:05:57,321 --> 01:05:59,254
                 Well, the fact
    that there's been a divorce

1636
01:05:59,256 --> 01:06:03,391
    doesn't mean to say there's
  got to be any unpleasantness.

1637
01:06:03,393 --> 01:06:04,359
     Really?

1638
01:06:05,429 --> 01:06:08,063
That was not my experience.

1639
01:06:23,480 --> 01:06:25,714
Suzanne, I knew
I'd find you here.

1640
01:06:25,716 --> 01:06:27,515
 Yeah, every afternoon.

1641
01:06:27,517 --> 01:06:29,184
Yeah, it's kind of
our secret spot.

1642
01:06:29,186 --> 01:06:32,220
          So don't tell anybody
                     I told you

1643
01:06:32,222 --> 01:06:35,023
        but we had your initial
                 tenure hearing

1644
01:06:35,025 --> 01:06:37,192
      and Deborah wants you out.

1645
01:06:37,194 --> 01:06:38,259
 What?

1646
01:06:38,261 --> 01:06:39,461
            ELISE:
  <i> This can't be happening.</i>

1647
01:06:39,463 --> 01:06:40,729
Are you serious?
You're not--

1648
01:06:40,731 --> 01:06:42,397
      Yeah, I'm serious
      as a vampire bite,

1649
01:06:42,399 --> 01:06:44,366
           you are
            O-U-T.

1650
01:06:44,368 --> 01:06:46,234
She's my mentor.
This can't be happening.

1651
01:06:46,236 --> 01:06:49,037
            She's really pissed
            that you got a lipo

1652
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:50,705
        and did a lecture on it.

1653
01:06:50,707 --> 01:06:53,041
What about my, you know,
the personal is political?

1654
01:06:53,043 --> 01:06:54,242
     That's how I teach.
   That's what she teaches.

1655
01:06:54,244 --> 01:06:56,244
            She says you're not
               a real feminist.

1656
01:06:56,246 --> 01:06:58,647
             Oh.
            What?

1657
01:06:58,648 --> 01:07:01,049
   Yeah, we vote on Friday.
   She is gunning for you.

1658
01:07:01,051 --> 01:07:02,484
      This is just like
 when we were in high school

1659
01:07:02,486 --> 01:07:04,652
   and all the popular kids
 went on the big senior trip

1660
01:07:04,654 --> 01:07:06,054
      but we stayed home
     because we didn't go

1661
01:07:06,056 --> 01:07:08,056
      and then we looked
       at the yearbook

1662
01:07:08,057 --> 01:07:10,057
and we were, like, "Oh, my God,
that looked like so much fun,

1663
01:07:10,060 --> 01:07:11,259
  I wish we would have gone."

1664
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:12,761
  But then the popular kids
          were like,

1665
01:07:12,763 --> 01:07:14,562
    "You should have gone.
 I mean, it was so much fun."

1666
01:07:14,564 --> 01:07:16,765
      But if we'd gone,
we would have just gotten hives

1667
01:07:16,767 --> 01:07:18,633
     and would have gone
       to the hospital.

1668
01:07:18,635 --> 01:07:22,170
   Don't you see,
   that's what this is?

1669
01:07:22,172 --> 01:07:24,706
        No, it's about the lipo.

1670
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:26,141
         <i> You know what she says</i>

1671
01:07:26,143 --> 01:07:28,510
             about the surgical
           mutilation of women.

1672
01:07:28,512 --> 01:07:31,112
                    Look, I got
            a breast reduction.

1673
01:07:31,114 --> 01:07:32,680
            What?
  'Cause they were too big.

1674
01:07:32,682 --> 01:07:37,118
          I had to.
   I stuff my bra for work.

1675
01:07:37,120 --> 01:07:38,420
     <i> No one knows.</i>

1676
01:07:38,422 --> 01:07:39,654
 I wouldn't have known.

1677
01:07:39,656 --> 01:07:41,056
  You stuff your bra for work?

1678
01:07:41,058 --> 01:07:43,124
      Okay, stop looking at 'em.

1679
01:07:43,126 --> 01:07:45,326
         Yes, ma'am.
   And keep it to yourself.

1680
01:07:47,564 --> 01:07:48,630
 We'll say nothing.

1681
01:07:48,632 --> 01:07:50,298
 Thank you.

1682
01:07:50,300 --> 01:07:51,299
      Sorry, girl.

1683
01:07:52,302 --> 01:07:53,301
 Thank you.

1684
01:07:54,404 --> 01:07:56,204
       They look so real.

1685
01:07:56,206 --> 01:07:57,639
I never knew.
I never knew.

1686
01:07:57,641 --> 01:07:59,441
 She's enormous breasts, still.

1687
01:07:59,443 --> 01:08:00,642
 It's crazy.

1688
01:08:00,644 --> 01:08:02,544
       RECORDER VOICE:
       <i> Call incoming.</i>

1689
01:08:02,546 --> 01:08:04,079
        <i> Unknown caller.</i>

1690
01:08:04,714 --> 01:08:05,847
 Hello?

1691
01:08:05,849 --> 01:08:07,549
Hi, I'm calling
for Peter Durton.

1692
01:08:07,551 --> 01:08:08,817
 Did you get the flowers?

1693
01:08:08,819 --> 01:08:10,218
( LAUGHING )
Why, yes.

1694
01:08:10,220 --> 01:08:11,486
But I have no idea why.

1695
01:08:11,488 --> 01:08:12,720
They're from Peter.

1696
01:08:12,722 --> 01:08:15,156
<i> He's in town</i>
<i> for the Oscars</i>

1697
01:08:15,158 --> 01:08:18,159
and he would like to
set up a drinks with you

1698
01:08:18,161 --> 01:08:19,794
at his private screening room

1699
01:08:19,796 --> 01:08:22,497
to discuss a book deal
through his publishing arm.

1700
01:08:22,499 --> 01:08:24,466
I'm sorry,
do I know you?

1701
01:08:24,468 --> 01:08:27,302
( LAUGHING )
Not me.

1702
01:08:27,304 --> 01:08:30,638
Peter Durton, the editor
of Cheswick Fair Magazine.

1703
01:08:30,640 --> 01:08:31,840
He also does books.

1704
01:08:31,842 --> 01:08:33,808
He rents a private
screening room

1705
01:08:33,810 --> 01:08:35,677
to watch the nominated films.

1706
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:37,145
He has a suite
at the Peninsula

1707
01:08:37,147 --> 01:08:38,813
but it always gets him
depressed.

1708
01:08:38,815 --> 01:08:42,283
So and he can't possibly
watch the movies

1709
01:08:42,285 --> 01:08:45,587
on a regular television,
oh, that's a nightmare.

1710
01:08:45,589 --> 01:08:47,388
Anyway, can you do
Tuesday at 4?

1711
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:49,824
I'm sorry,
how does he even know me?

1712
01:08:49,826 --> 01:08:52,660
From the Internet,
obviously.

1713
01:08:52,662 --> 01:08:53,862
Congrats on that,
by the way.

1714
01:08:53,864 --> 01:08:55,730
 Hence the flowers.

1715
01:08:55,732 --> 01:08:56,831
        Ah.

1716
01:08:56,833 --> 01:08:58,399
Tuesday at 4.
We'll see you.

1717
01:09:00,637 --> 01:09:03,605
   I'm so glad you came by.
   Can you stay for dinner?

1718
01:09:03,607 --> 01:09:08,910
            Maybe.
            Yeah.

1719
01:09:08,912 --> 01:09:10,612
                     What a day.

1720
01:09:10,614 --> 01:09:12,780
She was my mentor,
you know?

1721
01:09:12,782 --> 01:09:14,516
I was counting on this.

1722
01:09:16,286 --> 01:09:20,255
      Well, you've got alimony,
                  I'm guessing.

1723
01:09:20,257 --> 01:09:22,257
       No.

1724
01:09:22,259 --> 01:09:24,659
We had a prenup
and I didn't fight it

1725
01:09:24,661 --> 01:09:27,295
'cause I didn't really
want to get paid by somebody

1726
01:09:27,297 --> 01:09:29,497
to not have sex with them,
you know?

1727
01:09:29,499 --> 01:09:31,933
                 That's ethical.

1728
01:09:31,934 --> 01:09:34,368
      I admire that but clearly
            you need more wine.

1729
01:09:34,371 --> 01:09:36,304
      Clearly.

1730
01:09:36,306 --> 01:09:38,640
I dunno, maybe
this Peter Durton thing

1731
01:09:38,642 --> 01:09:40,208
will turn out to be
something.

1732
01:09:40,911 --> 01:09:43,678
                   You're going?

1733
01:09:43,680 --> 01:09:45,580
Yeah.

1734
01:09:45,582 --> 01:09:46,648
You're not upset,
are you?

1735
01:09:46,650 --> 01:09:48,183
           Date anyone you like.

1736
01:09:48,185 --> 01:09:49,417
 It's not a date, okay?

1737
01:09:49,419 --> 01:09:51,653
His assistant said
it's drinks.

1738
01:09:51,655 --> 01:09:53,855
                 In his private
                 screening room

1739
01:09:53,857 --> 01:09:56,925
             because he's bored
     of his luxury hotel suite.

1740
01:09:56,927 --> 01:09:58,793
          It sounds like a date.

1741
01:09:58,795 --> 01:10:00,228
             Lunch is a meeting.

1742
01:10:00,230 --> 01:10:03,665
     Drinks in a screening room
                     is a date.

1743
01:10:03,667 --> 01:10:07,202
Please tell me that
you are trying to be funny.

1744
01:10:07,204 --> 01:10:10,271
           No, I'm dead serious.

1745
01:10:10,273 --> 01:10:14,209
       But then again, I'm just
  the rebound from the rebound.

1746
01:10:14,211 --> 01:10:16,544
          There's a whole world
                     out there.

1747
01:10:16,546 --> 01:10:20,548
I just-- I thought
you were the nice guy.

1748
01:10:24,921 --> 01:10:26,688
               Is it not Monday?

1749
01:10:26,690 --> 01:10:28,389
                      No, it is.

1750
01:10:28,391 --> 01:10:31,726
        Good to see you, buddy.
          You remember Suzanne.

1751
01:10:31,728 --> 01:10:32,794
  Hi.

1752
01:10:32,796 --> 01:10:36,231
                Oh, yeah, sure.
                   Hi, I guess.

1753
01:10:36,233 --> 01:10:37,565
                 Is she staying
                    for dinner?

1754
01:10:37,567 --> 01:10:39,901
 No. No, I can't.

1755
01:10:39,903 --> 01:10:42,937
Thanks.
I have to go actually.

1756
01:10:42,939 --> 01:10:44,606
 Thank you, though.

1757
01:10:44,608 --> 01:10:46,708
We can talk later, right?

1758
01:10:46,710 --> 01:10:48,476
                Yeah, I'll give

      you even tried it

01:30:00,629 --> 01:30:03,463
        <i> What? Don't look at me</i>
                    <i> like that.</i>

2203
01:30:03,465 --> 01:30:04,698
             I'm gonna miss you
                       so much.

2204
01:30:04,700 --> 01:30:08,168
Oh, honey, oh, I know.
We're real friends.

2205
01:30:08,170 --> 01:30:09,803
I'm gonna see you
all the time.

2206
01:30:09,805 --> 01:30:10,871
                      Oh, don't.

2207
01:30:10,873 --> 01:30:12,973
Oh, honey,
it's gonna be fine.

2208
01:30:12,975 --> 01:30:17,177

2209
01:30:17,179 --> 01:30:20,547
       ( MUSIC PLAYING )

2210
01:30:24,987 --> 01:30:26,620
            Cheese!

     <i> ¶ I don't wanna be</i>
       <i> Someone else ¶</i>

2212
01:30:29,491 --> 01:30:32,192
  <i> ¶ I only wanna be myself ¶</i>

2213
01:30:32,194 --> 01:30:33,894
       <i> ¶ I feel alive ¶</i>

2214
01:30:33,896 --> 01:30:35,195
       <i> ¶ I feel alive ¶</i>

2215
01:30:35,197 --> 01:30:37,631
    <i> ¶ And I am beautiful ¶</i>

2216
01:30:37,633 --> 01:30:40,600
     <i> ¶ I don't wanna be</i>
       <i> Someone else ¶</i>

2217
01:30:40,602 --> 01:30:43,737
      <i> ¶ I'm happy when</i>
      <i> I'm just myself ¶</i>

    <i> ¶ And I am beautiful ¶</i>

2221
01:31:17,539 --> 01:31:20,073
When I met Suzanne,

2222
01:31:20,075 --> 01:31:21,541
 I thought one thing.

2223
01:31:21,543 --> 01:31:23,477
I thought,
"There's a woman."

2224
01:31:23,479 --> 01:31:25,579
And the second thing
I thought was,

2225
01:31:25,581 --> 01:31:27,614
and I don't
like to use this word

2226
01:31:27,616 --> 01:31:29,249
but in my profession
I have to,

2227
01:31:29,251 --> 01:31:31,518
 "There's a fat woman."

2228
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:33,887
 And when she, God help me,

2229
01:31:33,889 --> 01:31:35,088
 I hate to use this word too,

2230
01:31:35,090 --> 01:31:38,525
when she waddled
into my room and she,

2231
01:31:38,527 --> 01:31:40,227
 and I hate to use this word,

2232
01:31:40,229 --> 01:31:43,029
"sat her fatness down,"

2233
01:31:43,031 --> 01:31:44,598
I tried to look her
in the eye.

2234
01:31:44,600 --> 01:31:45,966
But all I could do
was look her in the fat

2235
01:31:45,968 --> 01:31:47,100
 and I thought,

2236
01:31:47,102 --> 01:31:48,535
"If I don't help
this woman now,

2237
01:31:48,537 --> 01:31:51,571
she'll be dead
within a week."

    <i> ¶ And I am beautiful ¶</i>

2248
01:32:19,601 --> 01:32:22,869
     <i> ¶ Make me an offer</i>
    <i> That I can't refuse ¶</i>

2249
01:32:22,871 --> 01:32:25,972
     <i> ¶ Make me a promise</i>

   <i> ¶ It's only me and you ¶</i>

       <i> ¶ All the time ¶</i>

2259

<i>¶ The earth continued turning ¶</i>

2260
01:33:47,322 --> 01:33:53,760
  <i> ¶ There was no lightning</i>
        <i> From above ¶</i>

2261
01:33:53,762 --> 01:33:59,733
      <i> ¶ It was my hands</i>
     <i> That were shaking ¶</i>

      <i> ¶ And say "I do" ¶</i>

2277
