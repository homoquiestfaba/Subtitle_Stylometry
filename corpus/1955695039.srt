1
00:01:05,315 --> 00:01:07,066
Where am I?

2
00:01:54,490 --> 00:01:56,491
Reconsider your answer

3
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,368
or be excluded
from the games forever.

4
00:02:28,607 --> 00:02:31,359
This is not the time.
Let us not broach the subject again.

5
00:02:31,527 --> 00:02:35,071
Quintus, why are you from bed?

6
00:02:35,239 --> 00:02:37,698
The medicus gave plain instruction
you are to rest.

7
00:02:37,866 --> 00:02:41,702
A week upon my back
sees advice well-heeded.

8
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,249
More, and even my cock
will cease knowing how to stand.

9
00:02:46,416 --> 00:02:47,875
His spirit returns.

10
00:02:48,043 --> 00:02:52,255
I am not a babe new dropped
from fucking womb.

11
00:02:52,422 --> 00:02:54,966
- See meat and wine set out.
- Yes, Domina.

12
00:02:56,385 --> 00:02:58,386
I always follow the wine.

13
00:02:58,554 --> 00:03:03,307
Your wounds... they
are less gruesome.

14
00:03:03,475 --> 00:03:06,435
Has she not yet found
some fool's bed to fall to yet?

15
00:03:06,603 --> 00:03:08,938
Or is her sole intent in Capua
to drink us dry?

16
00:03:09,106 --> 00:03:10,773
She has been of great comfort.

17
00:03:10,941 --> 00:03:13,234
And seeks the word for herself.

18
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,446
Who do you think dried my tears
when my husband was returned to me

19
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:20,658
bloodied and broken,
his life in question?

20
00:03:20,826 --> 00:03:22,827
I live

21
00:03:22,995 --> 00:03:26,247
and continue thoughts
towards doing so.

22
00:03:26,415 --> 00:03:28,749
I would not see my injuries
wound you as well.

23
00:03:37,301 --> 00:03:39,844
Oh, it's a balm
to see you on your feet.

24
00:03:44,266 --> 00:03:46,767
You're going to speak
to the magistrate about this?

25
00:03:46,935 --> 00:03:48,352
Towards what end?

26
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,146
Quintus.

27
00:03:50,314 --> 00:03:52,231
He is a puppet.

28
00:03:52,399 --> 00:03:54,483
What redress would Sextus offer,

29
00:03:54,651 --> 00:03:57,904
when the man who grieved me
holds his strings?

30
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:01,699
Tullius has always
been a favored son of Capua.

31
00:04:01,867 --> 00:04:04,952
I cannot believe he would be capable
of doing such a thing.

32
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:09,540
A man of ambition
is capable of anything.

33
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:14,670
My dealings with the magistrate
take precedence tomorrow.

34
00:04:14,838 --> 00:04:17,006
I would have you greet Varus
in my stead.

35
00:04:17,174 --> 00:04:19,800
The honor would be mine.
The man pisses wine and shits gold.

36
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:23,054
Varus is but a stream
leading to an ocean of coin...

37
00:04:23,221 --> 00:04:25,973
one I would see break wave
upon our steps.

38
00:04:26,141 --> 00:04:27,683
He comes to choose men?

39
00:04:27,851 --> 00:04:29,810
For the games of the Vinalia,

40
00:04:29,978 --> 00:04:32,939
to ensure his vines bear fruit
in the coming year.

41
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:35,775
I will present
only our finest gladiators.

42
00:04:38,028 --> 00:04:41,113
I would enrich our stock

43
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,741
and offer him Gannicus as well.

44
00:04:45,994 --> 00:04:47,703
This had best be
the Falernian promised.

45
00:04:47,871 --> 00:04:50,039
If I find you've served
your usual swill,

46
00:04:50,207 --> 00:04:52,124
we will have words.

47
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:54,001
Put mind to ease.

48
00:04:54,169 --> 00:04:55,962
Tullius.

49
00:04:56,129 --> 00:04:58,089
Note sun and mountains
etched in the amphora...

50
00:04:58,256 --> 00:05:00,216
proof of its authenticity.

51
00:05:00,384 --> 00:05:01,676
Yes, of course.

52
00:05:01,843 --> 00:05:05,513
I was unaware you had an appreciation
for such tastes, Solonius.

53
00:05:05,681 --> 00:05:09,225
A gift for a friend
recovering from unfortunate injury.

54
00:05:10,268 --> 00:05:11,894
Please.

55
00:05:12,062 --> 00:05:13,729
Allow me.

56
00:05:15,232 --> 00:05:17,066
Generous but unnecessary.

57
00:05:17,234 --> 00:05:19,151
I believe it is.

58
00:05:22,990 --> 00:05:25,324
I've done nothing to deserve it.

59
00:05:25,492 --> 00:05:28,369
A matter shortly to be rectified.

60
00:05:28,537 --> 00:05:32,665
Come, I would discuss message
to be delivered with our gift,

61
00:05:32,833 --> 00:05:35,167
better received from your tongue
than mine.

62
00:06:35,812 --> 00:06:38,814
The Gaul is quite the beast.

63
00:06:38,982 --> 00:06:41,442
What name does he take?

64
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:44,278
Apologies. I do not know.

65
00:06:44,446 --> 00:06:46,155
His name is Crixus.

66
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:48,574
He trains
in the style of murmillo.

67
00:06:48,742 --> 00:06:51,494
You have an interest
in the games

68
00:06:51,661 --> 00:06:54,622
or does it land only upon the men
who play them?

69
00:06:57,334 --> 00:07:00,336
So easily made to blush...

70
00:07:00,504 --> 00:07:03,130
a sign of tragic inexperience.

71
00:07:03,298 --> 00:07:05,216
I have not turned such a color

72
00:07:05,383 --> 00:07:07,301
since before you were born.

73
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:11,388
How I envy your youth

74
00:07:11,556 --> 00:07:15,351
and all the wonders
you have yet to discover.

75
00:07:15,519 --> 00:07:17,394
Do not be afraid to pursue

76
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,855
every delight
this world has to offer.

77
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,774
Melitta cautions patience.

78
00:07:21,942 --> 00:07:25,152
Plucking flowers too quickly
will bruise the petals.

79
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:27,029
Words from a mouth

80
00:07:27,197 --> 00:07:29,698
that has only known
her husband's cock.

81
00:07:51,429 --> 00:07:53,430
You charge like a crazed goat,

82
00:07:53,598 --> 00:07:55,975
absent thought.

83
00:07:57,853 --> 00:08:00,479
When faced
with stronger opponent,

84
00:08:00,647 --> 00:08:05,067
draw him to you, then counter.

85
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,070
Again.

86
00:08:30,969 --> 00:08:35,264
Finally words find way
through thick skull.

87
00:08:36,641 --> 00:08:39,977
Crixus, join the recruits.
Continue your training.

88
00:08:40,145 --> 00:08:41,770
Yes, Doctore.

89
00:08:46,109 --> 00:08:48,611
The mighty Gaul returns.

90
00:08:48,778 --> 00:08:52,072
Or is it his corpse,
too stubborn to fall to grass?

91
00:08:54,743 --> 00:08:58,829
Ah, Dagan expresses his joy
at finding you yet among us.

92
00:08:58,997 --> 00:09:01,665
We feared you were fated
for the mines,

93
00:09:01,833 --> 00:09:03,667
with all the sand
you have been eating.

94
00:09:07,422 --> 00:09:08,964
An acquired taste.

95
00:09:09,132 --> 00:09:12,426
Come, I should serve you
some more.

96
00:09:19,726 --> 00:09:22,186
You've done well with the man.

97
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:26,357
Crixus is undisciplined
but not without promise.

98
00:09:26,524 --> 00:09:28,901
He brings to thought
a wild fuck I schooled

99
00:09:29,069 --> 00:09:31,445
when we yet called
Batiatus's father Dominus.

100
00:09:31,613 --> 00:09:34,073
I yet feel
the sting of your lessons,

101
00:09:34,241 --> 00:09:36,951
their knowledge now bestowed
upon simple recruits.

102
00:09:37,118 --> 00:09:39,828
I will seek word with Batiatus

103
00:09:39,996 --> 00:09:41,914
towards your return
to the arena.

104
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,751
- Gratitude, Doctore.
- Close fucking mouth.

105
00:09:45,919 --> 00:09:48,003
I but seek not to have wasted
long years

106
00:09:48,171 --> 00:09:49,922
of pulling your head
from your ass.

107
00:10:03,395 --> 00:10:05,104
Doctore,

108
00:10:05,272 --> 00:10:06,981
I require
a more worthy opponent...

109
00:10:07,148 --> 00:10:09,900
perhaps if Oenomaus is finished
sipping drink?

110
00:10:11,194 --> 00:10:14,196
Instruct Gannicus in the ways
of a true champion.

111
00:10:34,718 --> 00:10:37,261
Kill! Kill! Kill! Kill!

112
00:10:55,071 --> 00:10:58,532
Do you recall Magnetius
when he fought Trux of the East?

113
00:11:05,123 --> 00:11:06,540
A glorious victory.

114
00:11:06,708 --> 00:11:09,084
For my father.

115
00:11:10,920 --> 00:11:12,921
Hadrianus...

116
00:11:17,302 --> 00:11:19,303
Acerbitas...

117
00:11:22,265 --> 00:11:24,266
Dolor...

118
00:11:28,646 --> 00:11:30,647
Zephyros...

119
00:11:37,989 --> 00:11:40,074
my father's champions,

120
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,618
my grandfather's champions,

121
00:11:42,786 --> 00:11:45,662
the storied history
of the House of Batiatus.

122
00:11:47,082 --> 00:11:49,750
With new chapters
yet to be added.

123
00:11:49,918 --> 00:11:52,294
Etched upon what tablet?

124
00:11:52,462 --> 00:11:54,296
I'm excluded from the games.

125
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:56,965
Or have such details slipped
memory's grasp?

126
00:11:57,133 --> 00:11:59,134
Apologies. I did not mean...

127
00:12:00,595 --> 00:12:03,055
Fault is mine for baring teeth
at trusted friend.

128
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:06,767
Gratitude for the gift.

129
00:12:06,935 --> 00:12:09,311
It's well received.

130
00:12:09,479 --> 00:12:12,231
I claim only its delivery.

131
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:16,193
He's willing to see
his bid for Gannicus doubled.

132
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:19,488
If accepted, he will grant your men
strong position

133
00:12:19,656 --> 00:12:21,865
in the upcoming games
of the Vinalia.

134
00:12:22,033 --> 00:12:23,575
This wine is from Tullius?

135
00:12:23,743 --> 00:12:25,536
I did not seek him out.

136
00:12:25,703 --> 00:12:27,955
He approached me
in the marketplace,

137
00:12:28,123 --> 00:12:30,124
expressing regret
that his business with you

138
00:12:30,291 --> 00:12:32,000
turned to excess.

139
00:12:32,168 --> 00:12:34,336
He even paid for the wine
that I'd selected for you...

140
00:12:34,504 --> 00:12:36,338
a gesture of goodwill.

141
00:12:36,506 --> 00:12:39,258
- Do you see these marks upon me?
- We must consider...

142
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:43,178
- Do you fucking see them?
- I see them.

143
00:12:43,346 --> 00:12:47,182
That is the man's true gesture,
the only to be considered.

144
00:12:49,018 --> 00:12:52,229
You counsel to suck the cock
that pisses on me!

145
00:12:52,397 --> 00:12:55,691
I merely counsel reason,
as your father would.

146
00:12:56,985 --> 00:12:58,527
To what purpose?

147
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:03,157
He brings word and gift
from Tullius,

148
00:13:03,324 --> 00:13:06,160
who yet seeks Gannicus
to swell his ranks.

149
00:13:06,327 --> 00:13:08,120
After what he
fucking did to you?

150
00:13:08,288 --> 00:13:11,748
Well, let us sweep aside
such petty grievances

151
00:13:11,916 --> 00:13:14,835
in service of reason and reward.

152
00:13:15,003 --> 00:13:17,963
He offers twice the sum refused.

153
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:23,343
And what, I wonder,
does good Solonius receive

154
00:13:23,511 --> 00:13:25,721
for convincing me
to spread cheeks

155
00:13:25,889 --> 00:13:27,890
and accept deeper ramming?

156
00:13:28,057 --> 00:13:30,350
I would share equal position
in the games.

157
00:13:30,518 --> 00:13:34,229
Oh, you are in remarkable condition
to claim my reflection.

158
00:13:35,273 --> 00:13:37,357
Our fates move
towards similar end,

159
00:13:37,525 --> 00:13:39,443
despite outward appearance.

160
00:13:39,611 --> 00:13:41,904
Refuse Tullius's offer,

161
00:13:42,071 --> 00:13:44,072
and I shall join you
in exclusion from the arena.

162
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:45,699
He makes such a threat?

163
00:13:45,867 --> 00:13:48,076
With exacting clarity.

164
00:13:51,247 --> 00:13:53,874
I did not mean
to see you burdened so.

165
00:13:55,418 --> 00:13:57,294
I will think upon the matter.

166
00:13:57,462 --> 00:13:59,254
Tullius requires answer.

167
00:13:59,422 --> 00:14:02,382
I require a fucking moment!

168
00:14:04,260 --> 00:14:07,930
He wishes to present your man
to Quintilius Varus tomorrow.

169
00:14:08,097 --> 00:14:10,849
Varus? He comes to Capua?

170
00:14:11,017 --> 00:14:14,144
Vettius is to meet him
as he enters the city midday.

171
00:14:14,312 --> 00:14:17,689
I held his acquaintance in Rome...
a man of great influence

172
00:14:17,857 --> 00:14:19,233
and coin.

173
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:21,735
You would beg
for Tullius' scraps?

174
00:14:21,903 --> 00:14:25,322
Without them, I fear
we shall both go hungry.

175
00:14:25,490 --> 00:14:27,032
Think upon it.

176
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,201
And know that I stand with you,

177
00:14:29,369 --> 00:14:31,787
whatever your decision.

178
00:14:33,498 --> 00:14:37,584
I have witnessed greater spine
within a snail.

179
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,965
What are your thoughts?

180
00:14:53,017 --> 00:14:54,935
Doctore!

181
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:58,397
Send that fucking man
to the mines.

182
00:15:00,108 --> 00:15:01,400
Do it!

183
00:15:06,114 --> 00:15:07,906
No, Doctore.

184
00:15:08,074 --> 00:15:11,493
No, please, Doctore.

185
00:15:11,661 --> 00:15:13,161
Dominus!

186
00:15:13,329 --> 00:15:16,999
We do not surrender
in this fucking house!

187
00:15:17,166 --> 00:15:20,794
I will see these walls fall to ruin
before missio is given!

188
00:15:22,338 --> 00:15:24,756
It appears decision is made.

189
00:15:30,597 --> 00:15:33,849
Gannicus will one day stand
the Champion of Capua

190
00:15:34,017 --> 00:15:35,976
for the House of Batiatus.

191
00:15:36,144 --> 00:15:38,812
How do we manage such honor
if excluded from the games?

192
00:15:45,153 --> 00:15:47,696
Tullius but brokers interest.

193
00:15:47,864 --> 00:15:50,741
If a man of wealth and position
such as Varus requested my men,

194
00:15:50,908 --> 00:15:52,993
even he would be
unable to refuse.

195
00:15:53,161 --> 00:15:54,911
He meets with Vettius.

196
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:57,581
You expect that fucking child
to make introduction?

197
00:15:57,749 --> 00:16:00,500
No, I expect him to bleed

198
00:16:00,668 --> 00:16:03,128
as I rip Varus from his grasp.

199
00:16:13,473 --> 00:16:15,265
Halt!

200
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:18,393
Rest.

201
00:16:20,063 --> 00:16:22,022
Eat.

202
00:16:33,409 --> 00:16:37,746
Ah, your numbers shrink
like frightened cock.

203
00:16:56,099 --> 00:16:59,685
A man is condemned to the mines
and they all fucking jest.

204
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:04,272
If it were a brother lost,
you would find the mood solemn.

205
00:17:04,440 --> 00:17:08,652
We must earn the fucking mark
to gain respect...

206
00:17:10,363 --> 00:17:12,739
or follow Indus to his fate.

207
00:17:12,907 --> 00:17:16,660
I will not die a faceless slave,
forgotten by history.

208
00:17:16,828 --> 00:17:19,579
We shall rise together.

209
00:17:19,747 --> 00:17:22,374
One day all the Republic

210
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:24,918
will marvel at the sight of us.

211
00:17:32,927 --> 00:17:35,303
Fucking savages.

212
00:17:38,307 --> 00:17:40,559
They pissed in the porridge.

213
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,618
I have had my fill.

214
00:17:58,786 --> 00:18:02,456
Oh, finally someone who can
hold their wine.

215
00:18:02,623 --> 00:18:04,458
I did not realize
we were for company.

216
00:18:04,625 --> 00:18:06,543
He leaves presently.

217
00:18:06,711 --> 00:18:09,212
Oh please,
after we have finished the jug...

218
00:18:09,380 --> 00:18:13,216
the last of my spoils to be shared
with dearest of friends.

219
00:18:13,384 --> 00:18:16,595
Replace "dearest" with "only"
and sentiment becomes truth.

220
00:18:16,763 --> 00:18:19,431
Settle argument... who was the better man
as we sparred today?

221
00:18:19,599 --> 00:18:21,767
- My husband.
- Ha.

222
00:18:21,934 --> 00:18:23,935
You are swayed
by the title of wife.

223
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:26,980
One day we shall face each other
upon the sand

224
00:18:27,148 --> 00:18:29,024
and have true decision.

225
00:18:29,192 --> 00:18:31,193
What would really happen

226
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:33,820
if you had to face each other
sine missione,

227
00:18:33,988 --> 00:18:36,031
no quarter given,
no mercy shown?

228
00:18:36,199 --> 00:18:38,742
I would give your husband
a glorious death.

229
00:18:38,910 --> 00:18:41,286
You joke of killing
a man you love

230
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,039
when someday
you may be asked to.

231
00:18:44,207 --> 00:18:47,167
Oh, you two are a perfect match,
are you not...

232
00:18:47,335 --> 00:18:50,879
both always fretting about
what tomorrow may bring?

233
00:18:51,047 --> 00:18:52,589
We are slaves,

234
00:18:52,757 --> 00:18:55,926
burden of choice and conscience
equally removed.

235
00:18:56,093 --> 00:18:59,429
We are truly free when we fight

236
00:18:59,597 --> 00:19:03,475
or when we fuck, which I shall leave
to do presently.

237
00:19:03,643 --> 00:19:06,394
It is you and my husband
who are of a perfect match...

238
00:19:06,562 --> 00:19:09,481
one hides true thought
in brooding silence,

239
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:13,527
the other in boastful jest
meant to hold all at a fair distance.

240
00:19:13,694 --> 00:19:16,404
- Melitta.
- I do not hold you at a distance.

241
00:19:16,572 --> 00:19:20,534
You are my two favorite women
in this world.

242
00:19:20,701 --> 00:19:22,619
And what happens,
brave Gannicus,

243
00:19:22,787 --> 00:19:24,579
when presented with circumstance

244
00:19:24,747 --> 00:19:26,957
you cannot laugh
or fight your way clear of?

245
00:19:29,126 --> 00:19:33,630
Well, I may have to
fuck my way clear of it.

246
00:19:35,049 --> 00:19:36,925
Good night.

247
00:19:56,487 --> 00:19:58,780
Gannicus.

248
00:19:58,948 --> 00:20:00,949
Never come up upon my back!

249
00:20:01,117 --> 00:20:02,450
Apologies.

250
00:20:02,618 --> 00:20:05,620
I seek only advice
for coming days.

251
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,958
Heed Oenomaus's instruction...

252
00:20:10,126 --> 00:20:12,002
you will earn your brand.

253
00:20:12,169 --> 00:20:14,963
Till then you stay from sight.

254
00:20:17,216 --> 00:20:19,509
It is not the brand
that concerns me.

255
00:20:21,137 --> 00:20:23,221
It is becoming champion.

256
00:20:25,224 --> 00:20:27,767
There is only one way
to become champion...

257
00:20:29,395 --> 00:20:32,188
never fucking lose.

258
00:20:40,197 --> 00:20:41,573
See Barca readied.

259
00:20:41,741 --> 00:20:43,909
He is to accompany me
to the city.

260
00:20:44,076 --> 00:20:46,244
Another stunt in the market?

261
00:20:46,412 --> 00:20:49,164
Does my last bodyguard's death
fucking elude?

262
00:20:49,332 --> 00:20:51,499
Barca is to serve as such?
He is a gladiator, not...

263
00:20:51,667 --> 00:20:53,668
He is whatever I fucking say.

264
00:20:53,836 --> 00:20:55,879
Have the Syrians also prepared,

265
00:20:56,047 --> 00:20:57,839
absent shackles
and clothed for the streets.

266
00:20:58,007 --> 00:21:00,884
Ashur, Dagan?
What use do you see them to?

267
00:21:01,052 --> 00:21:02,552
None of your concern.

268
00:21:02,720 --> 00:21:04,429
With respect, Dominus,
I am the doctore.

269
00:21:04,597 --> 00:21:05,972
The men are my only concern.

270
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:08,934
A duty awarded you by my father.

271
00:21:09,101 --> 00:21:11,019
A man who would not condemn
a promising recruit

272
00:21:11,187 --> 00:21:13,021
to the mines out of a mood.

273
00:21:13,189 --> 00:21:17,859
Recruits, gladiators,
even you are but slaves,

274
00:21:18,027 --> 00:21:21,196
mine to command
despite my fucking moods.

275
00:21:24,367 --> 00:21:27,535
You truly believe this man
ripe with potential?

276
00:21:27,703 --> 00:21:30,664
Indus will never be champion,

277
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,959
but he is not without skill.

278
00:21:34,126 --> 00:21:36,044
Have him loaded
with the Syrians.

279
00:21:36,212 --> 00:21:38,213
I will give him opportunity
to prove his worth.

280
00:21:39,256 --> 00:21:41,257
Dominus.

281
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:47,555
Has Venus herself ever appeared

282
00:21:47,723 --> 00:21:49,849
in such rare form?

283
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,393
You blaspheme.

284
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:54,062
Frequently and with great relish.

285
00:21:56,107 --> 00:21:59,693
Where is Gaia?
The appointed hour is upon us.

286
00:21:59,860 --> 00:22:02,070
She stands ready.

287
00:22:02,238 --> 00:22:04,614
- Quintus...
- Do not give voice to doubt.

288
00:22:04,782 --> 00:22:07,575
We are committed
and will see this to its end.

289
00:22:17,670 --> 00:22:19,629
You each know your parts.

290
00:22:19,797 --> 00:22:23,091
See this act to successful completion
and earn the mark of the brotherhood.

291
00:22:23,259 --> 00:22:24,968
Without proving ourselves
in the test?

292
00:22:25,136 --> 00:22:27,554
This is your test.

293
00:22:27,722 --> 00:22:30,640
But turn thoughts toward escape
or fail in this charge,

294
00:22:30,808 --> 00:22:33,810
and I will have you parted
from your cocks and crucified.

295
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:37,272
You're clear to your purpose?

296
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,107
Yes, Dominus.

297
00:22:41,485 --> 00:22:44,112
Take up your positions
and await my signal.

298
00:22:52,246 --> 00:22:54,289
I do not trust the Syrians.

299
00:22:54,457 --> 00:22:56,833
If this does not end
in our favor,

300
00:22:57,001 --> 00:22:58,960
they will appear
as common thieves,

301
00:22:59,128 --> 00:23:02,172
absent my fucking mark upon arm.

302
00:23:10,056 --> 00:23:11,931
This will never work.

303
00:23:12,099 --> 00:23:14,976
Of course it will. Look at you.

304
00:23:15,144 --> 00:23:18,480
What man or otherwise
could resist such charms?

305
00:23:18,647 --> 00:23:20,106
Gaia.

306
00:23:20,274 --> 00:23:22,650
Oh, still fluttering heart.

307
00:23:22,818 --> 00:23:25,653
I would not deny myself such pleasures
if presented again,

308
00:23:25,821 --> 00:23:28,782
yet necessities
shift attention to cock,

309
00:23:28,949 --> 00:23:30,658
and a golden one at that.

310
00:23:30,826 --> 00:23:32,786
You set eyes towards Varus?

311
00:23:32,953 --> 00:23:36,206
He is without wife, last I heard.

312
00:23:37,666 --> 00:23:40,668
We do this to aid my husband,
not to secure one of your own.

313
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,839
He arrives.

314
00:23:45,007 --> 00:23:48,176
Let us end discussion
and set mind to purpose.

315
00:24:13,869 --> 00:24:16,329
Good Vettius,
thank the gods I have found you.

316
00:24:16,497 --> 00:24:19,040
Your gratitude is misplaced.
I do not know you.

317
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:20,542
I am Varus's man.

318
00:24:20,709 --> 00:24:22,836
He sends word of pressing desire
to see the new arena

319
00:24:23,003 --> 00:24:25,380
before retiring to business.

320
00:24:25,548 --> 00:24:27,757
The arena? No.

321
00:24:27,925 --> 00:24:31,094
I am of clear instruction to meet him
as he enters the city.

322
00:24:31,262 --> 00:24:33,972
Of course. Apologies.

323
00:24:34,140 --> 00:24:36,683
I will deliver word
of your refusal.

324
00:24:38,060 --> 00:24:40,061
Wait.

325
00:24:42,148 --> 00:24:44,315
Varus is honored guest.

326
00:24:44,483 --> 00:24:46,901
As such, I am
but humble servant.

327
00:24:56,704 --> 00:24:59,038
It's quicker, I think,
if we pass through here.

328
00:24:59,206 --> 00:25:01,499
Apologies for the inconvenience.

329
00:25:01,667 --> 00:25:04,586
Dominus will be most pleased
that you've accompanied me.

330
00:25:04,753 --> 00:25:06,629
You've turned yourself about.

331
00:25:06,797 --> 00:25:08,798
This is not the direction
of the fucking arena.

332
00:25:10,301 --> 00:25:12,093
No.

333
00:25:13,179 --> 00:25:14,512
It is not.

334
00:25:47,129 --> 00:25:48,421
No.

335
00:25:50,090 --> 00:25:53,676
We are to leave this one alive,

336
00:25:53,844 --> 00:25:55,845
you simple fuck.

337
00:26:21,288 --> 00:26:23,164
Our charge is met.

338
00:26:23,332 --> 00:26:25,124
I will not see the mines.

339
00:26:25,292 --> 00:26:28,670
I fear they would have been
a blessing.

340
00:26:31,674 --> 00:26:33,508
Apologies, brother.

341
00:26:33,676 --> 00:26:35,677
Vettius saw your face.

342
00:26:35,844 --> 00:26:38,471
Dominus gave instruction.

343
00:27:05,666 --> 00:27:08,459
Where the fuck is Vettius?

344
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:10,503
Quintilius.

345
00:27:10,671 --> 00:27:13,089
It is you.

346
00:27:13,257 --> 00:27:16,718
Gaia. What finds you
in such horrid climes?

347
00:27:16,885 --> 00:27:19,178
A visit to see dearest friend.

348
00:27:20,389 --> 00:27:22,265
Lucretia.

349
00:27:22,433 --> 00:27:24,434
Lucretia and
her husband Batiatus

350
00:27:24,601 --> 00:27:27,562
are the saving grace
of this ill-bred town.

351
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:29,689
This is Quintilius Varus,

352
00:27:29,857 --> 00:27:32,442
an acquaintance
of my late husband.

353
00:27:32,609 --> 00:27:34,819
His wine is the toast of Rome.

354
00:27:34,987 --> 00:27:36,696
Your tongue has lost
none of its silver.

355
00:27:36,864 --> 00:27:38,531
It's an honor.

356
00:27:38,699 --> 00:27:40,575
And what good fortune blesses Capua
with your presence?

357
00:27:40,743 --> 00:27:42,660
I come to choose gladiators
for the Vinalia,

358
00:27:42,828 --> 00:27:46,289
or would, if young Vettius
ever deigns to appear.

359
00:27:47,333 --> 00:27:51,502
We shall entertain you with
diverting conversation while you wait.

360
00:27:51,670 --> 00:27:53,421
I fear it shall be
tragically one-sided.

361
00:27:53,589 --> 00:27:55,214
The sun threatens
to bake me senseless.

362
00:27:55,382 --> 00:27:59,260
We cannot have such esteemed guest
expire so, can we?

363
00:27:59,428 --> 00:28:01,763
Well, my husband's villa
is but a little ways from here.

364
00:28:01,930 --> 00:28:03,514
You'd be more than welcome to...

365
00:28:03,682 --> 00:28:06,309
Gratitude, but I would
seek Vettius out

366
00:28:06,477 --> 00:28:09,562
and put foot to ass for his delay.

367
00:28:09,730 --> 00:28:12,273
Lucretia's slaves know the man.

368
00:28:12,441 --> 00:28:14,400
It would be just as easy
for them

369
00:28:14,568 --> 00:28:16,944
to bring him to her villa
when discovered

370
00:28:17,112 --> 00:28:20,740
and give us much needed pause
to reacquaint ourselves.

371
00:28:20,908 --> 00:28:23,409
Well, it would be ungrateful

372
00:28:23,577 --> 00:28:26,412
to refuse such kind offering.

373
00:28:26,580 --> 00:28:27,663
Your villa then.

374
00:28:27,831 --> 00:28:30,041
My husband will be most pleased
to receive you.

375
00:28:31,043 --> 00:28:33,711
What good fortune
to run into you.

376
00:28:47,309 --> 00:28:50,478
The last time I was graced
with Gaia's presence

377
00:28:50,646 --> 00:28:52,814
was at some sober,
airless affair

378
00:28:52,981 --> 00:28:55,358
hosted by...
oh, what was the man's name?

379
00:28:55,526 --> 00:28:57,485
- Atticus.
- Atticus, yes.

380
00:28:57,653 --> 00:28:59,487
Desiccated specimen.

381
00:28:59,655 --> 00:29:02,657
I fear without Gaia's charms,
pronounced boredom

382
00:29:02,825 --> 00:29:05,076
would have carried me to the afterlife
that very night.

383
00:29:06,161 --> 00:29:09,038
Oh, my husband returns.
Fetch more wine.

384
00:29:09,206 --> 00:29:12,333
Lucretia, apologies.

385
00:29:12,501 --> 00:29:14,836
I did not realize
we were to entertain.

386
00:29:15,003 --> 00:29:17,255
An unexpected pleasure
chanced upon in the city.

387
00:29:17,423 --> 00:29:21,008
Quintilius Varus...
an old friend from Rome.

388
00:29:21,176 --> 00:29:24,178
Ah, the name is not unfamiliar.
You honor us with your presence.

389
00:29:24,346 --> 00:29:28,015
The honor is mine, to fall upon
such warm hospitality.

390
00:29:28,183 --> 00:29:30,852
Ah, forgive unsightly
countenance.

391
00:29:31,019 --> 00:29:34,272
A mount long trusted
threw me from purchase.

392
00:29:34,440 --> 00:29:36,649
One must be cautious
when dealing with such animals.

393
00:29:36,817 --> 00:29:39,152
Yeah, a lesson painfully learned.

394
00:29:39,319 --> 00:29:42,905
What finds you so far from Rome?

395
00:29:43,073 --> 00:29:45,408
Games of the Vinalia.

396
00:29:45,576 --> 00:29:46,993
You come to choose men?

397
00:29:47,161 --> 00:29:50,246
I have many fine offerings...
Gannicus in particular.

398
00:29:50,414 --> 00:29:52,915
Apologies. You are a Lanista?

399
00:29:53,083 --> 00:29:56,919
Oh, he has already set purpose
towards Vettius' men.

400
00:29:57,087 --> 00:29:59,172
Ah, well,

401
00:29:59,339 --> 00:30:01,215
fill cup and strike ill-spoken word
from mind.

402
00:30:01,383 --> 00:30:04,510
A thing of no concern.
Vettius will see you well attended.

403
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:07,054
At considerable savings.

404
00:30:08,390 --> 00:30:10,766
Do I appear so light of purse
to require such?

405
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:14,729
You have never been so taken
with the games.

406
00:30:14,897 --> 00:30:18,316
I only assumed you would not waste
excessive coin towards them.

407
00:30:18,484 --> 00:30:21,194
True, yet the gods
must be properly honored

408
00:30:21,361 --> 00:30:24,030
and Vettius remains
annoyingly absent.

409
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:27,241
Your men...

410
00:30:27,409 --> 00:30:30,161
how stand they
in comparison to the boy's?

411
00:30:30,329 --> 00:30:33,414
Well, I would not speak ill
of a brother Lanista.

412
00:30:33,582 --> 00:30:35,791
You are too modest.

413
00:30:35,959 --> 00:30:39,170
Vettius offers shit.

414
00:30:39,338 --> 00:30:42,215
I was told by good Tullius
that his stable is well stocked.

415
00:30:42,382 --> 00:30:45,510
The boy chooses gladiators
as carelessly as his wine...

416
00:30:45,677 --> 00:30:49,263
high quantity
of the lowest quality.

417
00:30:49,431 --> 00:30:52,433
Come, let us sample
a finer vintage.

418
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:57,188
Please.

419
00:31:10,536 --> 00:31:11,702
Doctore.

420
00:31:14,164 --> 00:31:16,958
Gladiators, form up.

421
00:31:17,125 --> 00:31:18,376
Present yourselves.

422
00:31:18,544 --> 00:31:22,213
Batiatus! Batiatus! Batiatus!

423
00:31:24,383 --> 00:31:26,300
Did I not tell you?

424
00:31:26,468 --> 00:31:29,595
The finest gladiators
in all of Capua.

425
00:31:29,763 --> 00:31:32,807
Hmm, a demonstration perhaps?

426
00:31:32,975 --> 00:31:34,809
Of course.

427
00:31:34,977 --> 00:31:37,144
Gannicus, step forward.

428
00:31:38,438 --> 00:31:40,982
Behold my finest champion.

429
00:31:41,149 --> 00:31:43,776
No man stands his equal.

430
00:31:43,944 --> 00:31:47,196
And who would you have face
this god of the arena?

431
00:31:47,364 --> 00:31:49,699
Barca perhaps or Oenomaus,
who fought so bravely?

432
00:31:49,866 --> 00:31:51,742
What about the Gaul?

433
00:31:51,910 --> 00:31:54,161
Who would not marvel
at seeing such a creature

434
00:31:54,329 --> 00:31:56,247
locked in mortal embrace?

435
00:31:57,833 --> 00:32:00,668
Crixus? Apologies.

436
00:32:00,836 --> 00:32:03,004
The man does not yet bear
the mark of the brotherhood.

437
00:32:03,171 --> 00:32:04,463
Yet he is presented.

438
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:07,341
I fear such a match
would be overly brief.

439
00:32:07,509 --> 00:32:09,260
A blessing,
considering the heat.

440
00:32:09,428 --> 00:32:12,305
Well, let us move to it then.

441
00:32:12,472 --> 00:32:14,599
Crixus!

442
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:18,853
Step forward.

443
00:32:28,739 --> 00:32:30,197
A fucking jest.

444
00:32:30,365 --> 00:32:32,575
The House of Batiatus is humbled

445
00:32:32,743 --> 00:32:35,786
by the attentions
of Quintilius Varus.

446
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:39,540
Let us show him
they are not unwarranted.

447
00:32:39,708 --> 00:32:43,252
Apologies. Are they to use
those little wooden sticks?

448
00:32:43,420 --> 00:32:46,631
Well, it is the tradition
when blood is not the purpose.

449
00:32:46,798 --> 00:32:49,008
So they are to fight
as children, not men?

450
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,221
Why, I would not see you
to such an impression.

451
00:32:54,389 --> 00:32:58,059
Doctore, have wood
give way to steel.

452
00:33:02,856 --> 00:33:04,565
Gladius.

453
00:33:18,830 --> 00:33:20,873
The gods have heard you.

454
00:33:21,041 --> 00:33:23,793
They present opportunity
to become champion.

455
00:33:27,756 --> 00:33:28,923
Begin.

456
00:33:42,771 --> 00:33:45,856
Oenomaus has trained you well.

457
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:52,405
Yet you are a pale imitation
of the man.

458
00:34:03,667 --> 00:34:06,043
You lie. I did no such thing.

459
00:35:09,441 --> 00:35:11,692
A fine attempt.

460
00:35:13,945 --> 00:35:16,530
Has there ever before been
such a demonstration?

461
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,827
What say you, good Varus?

462
00:35:21,995 --> 00:35:23,913
Should the Gaul live or die?

463
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:27,291
Well, Gaia chose the man,
let the choice be hers.

464
00:35:37,552 --> 00:35:39,053
Let him live.

465
00:35:41,139 --> 00:35:43,349
He may yet find his use.

466
00:35:54,611 --> 00:35:57,571
What of my man Gannicus?
Did you find him to your liking?

467
00:35:57,739 --> 00:36:01,784
The man is weary
from his travels.

468
00:36:01,952 --> 00:36:04,662
Let us not press him
with further business.

469
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:08,040
Come see yourself inside

470
00:36:08,208 --> 00:36:11,001
to sample other indulgences.

471
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:13,754
Some delights
from Cyprus perhaps?

472
00:36:13,922 --> 00:36:16,340
A region I'm most fond of.

473
00:36:16,508 --> 00:36:18,509
As I recall.

474
00:36:19,928 --> 00:36:21,303
What the fuck are you doing?

475
00:36:21,471 --> 00:36:23,430
What I do best.

476
00:36:23,598 --> 00:36:25,474
Varus is a man
of particular appetites

477
00:36:25,642 --> 00:36:30,271
which grow strong
under influence of wine and opium.

478
00:36:30,438 --> 00:36:32,273
See your man Gannicus
oiled and scented,

479
00:36:32,440 --> 00:36:35,025
to be presented
as the hour passes.

480
00:36:38,655 --> 00:36:40,656
I risk all to lure Varus
to our house

481
00:36:40,824 --> 00:36:42,904
only to find I am no longer
the fucking master of it.

482
00:36:43,034 --> 00:36:45,578
She knows the man
more intimately than we do.

483
00:36:45,745 --> 00:36:48,122
We must lend her our trust.

484
00:36:48,290 --> 00:36:51,542
Let us pray it is not soiled
upon return.

485
00:37:00,468 --> 00:37:02,845
See Gannicus prepared
and brought up to the villa.

486
00:37:03,013 --> 00:37:04,638
And what will be
required of him?

487
00:37:04,806 --> 00:37:06,640
Whatever I fucking desire.

488
00:37:06,808 --> 00:37:09,977
Ashur and Dagan returned absent Indus.
Did he not prove himself?

489
00:37:10,145 --> 00:37:12,980
He did, and was well-rewarded.

490
00:37:13,148 --> 00:37:15,482
And the Syrians...
are they to be rewarded as well?

491
00:37:15,650 --> 00:37:17,484
With the mark of the brotherhood.

492
00:37:17,652 --> 00:37:19,528
The mark?

493
00:37:19,696 --> 00:37:22,364
Without proving themselves
in the test?

494
00:37:22,532 --> 00:37:26,201
They proved themselves in my test.
See it done.

495
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:29,413
- Your father would never approve.
- I am not my fucking father!

496
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:31,498
A fact well-known.

497
00:37:31,666 --> 00:37:35,502
See to Gannicus,
brand the fucking Syrians

498
00:37:35,670 --> 00:37:37,588
and inform Oenomaus

499
00:37:37,756 --> 00:37:40,674
that he is to assume
mantle of doctore.

500
00:37:42,469 --> 00:37:44,178
Dominus.

501
00:37:44,346 --> 00:37:47,848
You are a relic,
as is my father...

502
00:37:48,016 --> 00:37:50,517
shadows from the past,

503
00:37:50,685 --> 00:37:53,437
soon to fade from memory.

504
00:37:54,648 --> 00:37:56,649
See to Gannicus.

505
00:38:14,709 --> 00:38:17,211
See how it caresses the wine?

506
00:38:17,379 --> 00:38:20,047
Is there anything so enticing?

507
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:22,841
I have seen its rival.

508
00:38:26,471 --> 00:38:29,556
This house indeed offers
many pleasures.

509
00:38:30,600 --> 00:38:34,103
With more yet to be presented.

510
00:38:37,023 --> 00:38:40,484
Pleasing this man must now become
your sole fucking purpose.

511
00:38:40,652 --> 00:38:43,570
Please him? In what manner?

512
00:38:43,738 --> 00:38:46,532
I have had my fill of being
questioned by slaves.

513
00:38:49,744 --> 00:38:53,038
If Varus wishes you
to suck his cock dry,

514
00:38:53,206 --> 00:38:55,082
you will savor every drop.

515
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:57,292
Are we of a singular mind?

516
00:38:59,254 --> 00:39:00,629
Dominus.

517
00:39:05,927 --> 00:39:08,012
In honor of distinguished guest,

518
00:39:08,179 --> 00:39:12,141
I present my finest man
for your personal viewing.

519
00:39:12,308 --> 00:39:17,438
Behold Gannicus,
yours to command.

520
00:39:22,861 --> 00:39:25,904
You are quite the Lanista,
Batiatus.

521
00:39:26,072 --> 00:39:29,366
I have never been so well-plied
towards aid of a sale.

522
00:39:29,534 --> 00:39:32,077
This is not about business.

523
00:39:32,245 --> 00:39:34,204
This is how they live.

524
00:39:34,372 --> 00:39:37,249
They grab life and squeeze
until the juice flows.

525
00:39:37,417 --> 00:39:40,794
How do you always come by
such marvelous acquaintance?

526
00:39:40,962 --> 00:39:42,796
It is a gift.

527
00:39:42,964 --> 00:39:48,343
One among many set before me.

528
00:39:50,180 --> 00:39:53,098
Is he not of a form...
our champion?

529
00:39:53,266 --> 00:39:55,476
I have not seen his like.

530
00:39:55,643 --> 00:39:58,979
And more than a few
have stood before me.

531
00:39:59,147 --> 00:40:01,231
The man stands as a god,

532
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,359
the arena his Olympus.

533
00:40:04,527 --> 00:40:07,321
He once thrust a blade so deep
into an opponent's breast

534
00:40:07,489 --> 00:40:09,698
that tears turned to blood.

535
00:40:09,866 --> 00:40:13,827
I'm not impressed
by inflated tales.

536
00:40:13,995 --> 00:40:15,996
My interests are grounded

537
00:40:16,164 --> 00:40:23,337
in what I can see,
what I can touch.

538
00:40:26,591 --> 00:40:29,885
Now that is impressive.

539
00:40:30,887 --> 00:40:35,641
Are you as skilled in its use
as you are with a sword?

540
00:40:40,730 --> 00:40:43,398
I would have demonstration.

541
00:40:44,984 --> 00:40:48,195
The man is yours.
We will lend privacy.

542
00:40:48,363 --> 00:40:51,532
No, you mistake intent.

543
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:54,201
No, I've had too much wine
and other pleasures

544
00:40:54,369 --> 00:40:56,370
for such rough exertion.

545
00:40:56,538 --> 00:40:59,873
No, I would prefer
a feast of the eyes.

546
00:41:00,041 --> 00:41:02,167
Oh, have him fuck this one

547
00:41:02,335 --> 00:41:04,670
and I shall watch.

548
00:41:05,839 --> 00:41:07,214
Apologies.

549
00:41:07,382 --> 00:41:10,342
For what? Is she not a slave?

550
00:41:11,386 --> 00:41:15,264
She is and will do as commanded.

551
00:41:35,743 --> 00:41:38,203
Welcome to the fucking
brotherhood.

552
00:41:40,748 --> 00:41:43,292
- Why are we gathered?
- The Syrians receive the mark.

553
00:41:43,459 --> 00:41:45,043
Absent the test?

554
00:41:56,723 --> 00:41:59,266
Wait, are we not
to recite the oath?

555
00:41:59,434 --> 00:42:03,228
I will not see more shit
heaped upon sacred rites.

556
00:42:06,107 --> 00:42:09,359
You may bear the mark, but don't
ever think yourself a gladiator,

557
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,944
you little cunt.

558
00:42:11,112 --> 00:42:12,571
Doctore!

559
00:42:16,659 --> 00:42:19,203
Do not fucking speak to me
in such tone.

560
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:20,412
Apologies.

561
00:42:20,580 --> 00:42:22,873
You believe yourself my equal,
Oenomaus?

562
00:42:23,041 --> 00:42:24,374
No, Doctore.

563
00:42:24,542 --> 00:42:26,919
Gladius...

564
00:42:28,546 --> 00:42:31,298
bring fucking swords.

565
00:42:39,474 --> 00:42:41,516
Now let us see
if you have learned

566
00:42:41,684 --> 00:42:44,561
all I have to teach.

567
00:42:58,660 --> 00:43:00,327
Remove her dress.

568
00:43:38,408 --> 00:43:40,284
Is that what I taught you,
Oenomaus...

569
00:43:40,451 --> 00:43:43,078
- Doctore.
- How to turn upon heel?

570
00:43:43,246 --> 00:43:44,663
Doctore.

571
00:43:45,748 --> 00:43:47,541
Doctore, stop.

572
00:43:50,753 --> 00:43:52,462
Fight me, you coward.

573
00:44:16,029 --> 00:44:19,114
- Melitta, l...
- See it done.

574
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:13,001
Prove yourself worthy, Oenomaus.

575
00:46:51,976 --> 00:46:54,895
I taught you well.

576
00:47:14,290 --> 00:47:17,125
- The man is dead?
- I did not want it.

577
00:47:17,293 --> 00:47:19,586
He forced me to fight.

578
00:47:19,754 --> 00:47:22,714
And I do not know the reason
for his anger toward me.

579
00:47:27,178 --> 00:47:31,640
The reason falls
to my own tongue.

580
00:47:31,807 --> 00:47:33,433
Earlier I revealed intent

581
00:47:33,601 --> 00:47:35,977
of raising you
to position of doctore.

582
00:47:36,145 --> 00:47:39,105
I am not to return to the arena?

583
00:47:39,273 --> 00:47:41,650
You are beyond such things now,

584
00:47:41,817 --> 00:47:44,069
proven by your training
of Crixus.

585
00:47:44,237 --> 00:47:47,614
Let us put the past behind us
and look to future glories.

586
00:47:50,326 --> 00:47:55,413
My wife... I know it
is not our time,

587
00:47:55,581 --> 00:47:57,666
but I would ask to see her.

588
00:47:58,668 --> 00:48:00,877
I will send her to you
when she has finished her duties.

589
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:03,046
Gratitude.

590
00:48:15,768 --> 00:48:19,145
Apologies. The demands
of a Lanista seldom offer respite.

591
00:48:19,313 --> 00:48:20,397
Oh, none required.

592
00:48:20,565 --> 00:48:23,692
This night has been filled
with unexpected joys.

593
00:48:23,859 --> 00:48:25,402
You remain in Capua?

594
00:48:25,570 --> 00:48:29,072
Until more adventurous
opportunities present themselves.

595
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:30,824
Ahh.

596
00:48:30,992 --> 00:48:34,286
I'll take my leave then
with promise of further discourse.

597
00:48:37,373 --> 00:48:40,333
Oh, your man Gannicus...

598
00:48:40,501 --> 00:48:43,295
I would see him perform again

599
00:48:43,462 --> 00:48:46,798
in the primus of my games.

600
00:48:46,966 --> 00:48:48,842
And you shall have him.

601
00:48:49,010 --> 00:48:50,719
Terms to be discussed.

602
00:48:50,886 --> 00:48:54,306
Gratitude for your hospitality.
It will not soon be forgot.

603
00:48:56,809 --> 00:48:59,185
Primus?

604
00:48:59,353 --> 00:49:01,396
Did I not tell you
I knew the man?

605
00:49:01,564 --> 00:49:04,190
May the gods strike me
for entertaining doubt.

606
00:49:04,358 --> 00:49:06,026
You were magnificent.

607
00:49:06,193 --> 00:49:08,486
Did I not tell you?

608
00:49:08,654 --> 00:49:11,531
You have elevated this house.

609
00:49:11,699 --> 00:49:13,700
Yet speak of how we came
by such honor

610
00:49:13,868 --> 00:49:16,953
and see brotherhood shattered
and a husband lost.

611
00:51:50,191 --> 00:51:54,235
I have done a terrible thing.

612
00:51:55,613 --> 00:51:58,198
We do what we must
in this house.
