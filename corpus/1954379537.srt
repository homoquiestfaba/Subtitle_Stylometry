1
00:04:01,430 --> 00:04:04,077
We're not turning around. He's gone!
What do you mean, he's gone?

2
00:04:04,112 --> 00:04:07,354
He was still moving.
I fucking saw him still moving.

3
00:04:07,356 --> 00:04:08,756
We killed people!

4
00:04:08,758 --> 00:04:10,590
What do you mean?
Turn the fucking car around!

5
00:04:10,592 --> 00:04:12,725
He's gone!
What are we supposed to do?

6
00:04:12,727 --> 00:04:15,228
Damn it, this shit's not worth it
for me to leave him there!

7
00:04:15,230 --> 00:04:19,666
God damn it! Please, I'm begging you.
He's my fucking brother.

8
00:04:19,668 --> 00:04:21,134
I said this would happen.

9
00:04:21,136 --> 00:04:22,468
Fuck you, Archie!

10
00:04:22,470 --> 00:04:25,537
You can't go anywhere
without your brother.

11
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:27,372
And I very almost got
my head blown off,

12
00:04:27,374 --> 00:04:30,342
because he's a fucking baby
who can't look after himself.

13
00:04:30,344 --> 00:04:31,743
Fuck you!

14
00:04:31,745 --> 00:04:33,278
Sit still!

15
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,345
God damn it!

16
00:04:34,347 --> 00:04:38,416
So then, now, look what
happens to him.

17
00:04:38,584 --> 00:04:41,285
Can't be feeling
responsible for that.

18
00:04:41,287 --> 00:04:43,454
If he was a man who
could look after himself,

19
00:04:43,456 --> 00:04:45,323
he'd be accepting it
right now.

20
00:04:45,325 --> 00:04:46,256
Fuck you.
Say that again.

21
00:04:46,258 --> 00:04:47,824
You heard me.
You know it.

22
00:04:47,826 --> 00:04:49,526
Fuck you, Archie!
Say that again!

23
00:04:49,528 --> 00:04:51,661
If he was a man, he wouldn't
be crying about it,

24
00:04:51,663 --> 00:04:52,762
he'd be accepting it.

25
00:04:52,764 --> 00:04:54,431
Say that one more
goddamn time.

26
00:04:54,765 --> 00:04:55,832
I said it twice.

27
00:04:55,834 --> 00:04:57,501
One more goddamn time,
Archie.

28
00:04:57,503 --> 00:04:59,802
If I said it again, I'd say it
the exact same way,

29
00:04:59,804 --> 00:05:01,270
and that'd be
three times I said it!

30
00:05:39,273 --> 00:05:40,673
Fuck!

31
00:06:38,494 --> 00:06:41,596
Let's go.
Come on, come on, come on.

32
00:06:41,598 --> 00:06:42,830
Come on!

33
00:08:28,828 --> 00:08:29,895
Who's this?

34
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:36,400
That's our truck, man.

35
00:08:36,402 --> 00:08:37,702
What?

36
00:09:00,957 --> 00:09:02,057
What the fuck's he doing?

37
00:09:02,059 --> 00:09:03,125
Jesus, fuck!

38
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:41,160
Fuck!

39
00:09:52,605 --> 00:09:54,739
Fuck!

40
00:09:57,909 --> 00:09:58,976
Fuck!

41
00:10:14,591 --> 00:10:16,125
Is he giving up?

42
00:10:16,127 --> 00:10:17,794
He ain't giving up.

43
00:10:19,129 --> 00:10:20,710
What's he doing?

44
00:10:22,183 --> 00:10:23,639
What's he doing?

45
00:10:32,175 --> 00:10:34,575
He's gonna keep
following us, man.

46
00:10:35,610 --> 00:10:39,480
Okay, okay, okay.

47
00:10:39,482 --> 00:10:43,117
Fuck you.
Fuck you.

48
00:11:21,153 --> 00:11:23,753
He's moving.

49
00:12:05,226 --> 00:12:08,996
What's going on
with you, brother?

50
00:12:12,132 --> 00:12:15,001
I said what's
going on, brother?

51
00:12:16,603 --> 00:12:19,171
I want my car back.

52
00:12:19,173 --> 00:12:20,840
Yeah, I can see that.

53
00:12:21,941 --> 00:12:23,842
You ain't gettin' it back.

54
00:12:25,011 --> 00:12:26,645
I want my car back.

55
00:12:27,179 --> 00:12:28,547
If you don't give
it to me now,

56
00:12:28,549 --> 00:12:30,148
I'm gonna get
back in that truck

57
00:12:30,150 --> 00:12:31,850
and I'm gonna stay
on you till you do.

58
00:12:34,186 --> 00:12:37,855
What makes you think I won't
kill you right here?

59
00:12:37,857 --> 00:12:38,923
Huh?

60
00:12:39,824 --> 00:12:42,760
Nothing makes me
think that.

61
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,662
Come on,
just for a little...

62
00:13:55,961 --> 00:13:58,061
<i>Area one, all clear.
Over.</i>

63
00:17:23,017 --> 00:17:24,918
Do you need anything?

64
00:17:27,121 --> 00:17:31,257
I'm looking for my car.
It's got three people in it.

65
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:34,092
It hasn't stopped here.

66
00:17:34,094 --> 00:17:35,861
They needed petrol.

67
00:17:36,229 --> 00:17:39,298
I haven't got any petrol.

68
00:17:39,300 --> 00:17:41,834
Did you see it?

69
00:17:41,836 --> 00:17:45,504
I haven't seen a car with three people
in it. Do you want to buy something?

70
00:17:45,506 --> 00:17:49,140
I've got tins of stuff and some
auto accessories and other things.

71
00:18:49,162 --> 00:18:53,199
I'm looking for a car
with three people in it.

72
00:18:53,201 --> 00:18:55,001
Have you seen it?

73
00:18:55,003 --> 00:18:57,503
No.

74
00:18:57,505 --> 00:18:59,037
Anyone else seen it?

75
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:00,672
I don't know.

76
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,174
Who would know?

77
00:19:03,176 --> 00:19:04,643
Maybe Grandma.

78
00:19:04,645 --> 00:19:06,611
Where's Grandma?

79
00:19:07,146 --> 00:19:09,481
Down there.

80
00:19:33,071 --> 00:19:37,506
I'm looking for my car.
It's got three men in it.

81
00:19:37,508 --> 00:19:40,208
Did it come through here?

82
00:19:42,078 --> 00:19:44,179
What's your name?

83
00:19:44,181 --> 00:19:47,114
Have you seen it?

84
00:19:47,116 --> 00:19:48,249
What's your name?

85
00:19:50,719 --> 00:19:53,321
Have you seen it?

86
00:19:53,323 --> 00:19:55,356
Do you want something?

87
00:19:57,125 --> 00:20:00,627
Do you want to
sleep with a boy?

88
00:20:00,629 --> 00:20:02,329
I've got a boy here
you can sleep with.

89
00:20:04,966 --> 00:20:08,535
He's smooth like
the inside of your arm.

90
00:20:35,526 --> 00:20:38,261
Stop fucking whispering.

91
00:20:45,669 --> 00:20:47,303
I need to buy a gun.

92
00:20:49,240 --> 00:20:52,708
Stop fucking whispering.
I'll fucking kill ya.

93
00:20:52,710 --> 00:20:54,410
You understand?

94
00:20:54,412 --> 00:20:56,245
I need a gun.

95
00:20:59,015 --> 00:21:00,315
Fuck!

96
00:21:00,317 --> 00:21:02,350
Fuck this shit!

97
00:21:20,268 --> 00:21:22,235
Fucking son of a bitch.

98
00:21:25,539 --> 00:21:27,573
Shut up!

99
00:21:34,415 --> 00:21:36,681
God, no.

100
00:21:42,255 --> 00:21:43,455
No...

101
00:21:52,330 --> 00:21:54,065
Have you got guns?

102
00:21:54,067 --> 00:21:56,300
What does it look like
I'm doing up here?

103
00:21:57,335 --> 00:21:59,736
I heard you.
I heard what you need.

104
00:22:02,339 --> 00:22:04,574
Fucking psycho.

105
00:22:07,678 --> 00:22:09,611
Careful.

106
00:22:11,314 --> 00:22:15,517
They're 300 each. That one's 300.
That one's 300.

107
00:22:15,519 --> 00:22:19,388
And that one's 300.
I only take US dollars.

108
00:22:19,390 --> 00:22:21,323
I don't have 300.

109
00:22:21,325 --> 00:22:24,125
They're $300 US.

110
00:22:24,127 --> 00:22:25,626
Can you do this one for less?

111
00:22:26,295 --> 00:22:28,296
I told you how much they cost.

112
00:22:28,298 --> 00:22:29,697
I don't have $300 US.

113
00:22:29,699 --> 00:22:31,699
They're 300. You don't have 300,
you can fuck off.

114
00:23:19,744 --> 00:23:23,446
I'm looking for my car.
Have you seen it?

115
00:23:24,348 --> 00:23:26,349
Tell me your name.
I want to know your name.

116
00:23:26,351 --> 00:23:28,484
Answer my question.
Answer mine.

117
00:23:28,486 --> 00:23:33,189
Answer my question.
I'm not gonna say it again.

118
00:23:33,191 --> 00:23:34,356
Okay.

119
00:23:35,658 --> 00:23:38,727
I'll call you "my baby. "

120
00:23:38,729 --> 00:23:40,395
My baby.

121
00:23:41,697 --> 00:23:43,265
There was a car

122
00:23:44,914 --> 00:23:50,237
and it had three men in it
and it did what most cars do.

123
00:23:50,239 --> 00:23:52,473
It came in one direction
and left in the other.

124
00:23:54,342 --> 00:23:57,544
That's all I can
tell you about it.

125
00:23:57,546 --> 00:24:03,483
The only detail I can tell you is the
detail that pertains to this place.

126
00:24:03,884 --> 00:24:06,653
I can tell you what they drank.

127
00:24:06,655 --> 00:24:08,755
I can tell you what
they smelled like.

128
00:24:09,489 --> 00:24:13,425
I can tell you what they said,
if they said anything

129
00:24:14,494 --> 00:24:17,563
and if I heard what
it was that they said.

130
00:24:17,565 --> 00:24:19,598
What did they say?

131
00:24:20,934 --> 00:24:24,402
They didn't say anything.
They didn't stop here.

132
00:24:28,473 --> 00:24:31,976
You must really
love that car, darling.

133
00:24:32,411 --> 00:24:36,780
What a thing to get worked up
about in this day and age.

134
00:24:41,285 --> 00:24:45,422
What is it about the car
that you love so much?

135
00:24:46,890 --> 00:24:49,892
Can you tell me?

136
00:24:53,363 --> 00:24:55,564
What's your name, sweetheart?

137
00:25:04,306 --> 00:25:05,640
Oh, don't be silly.

138
00:25:06,408 --> 00:25:09,943
Now you're just being rude.

139
00:25:49,381 --> 00:25:51,515
What are you
doing with this car?

140
00:25:52,617 --> 00:25:54,685
It's my brother's car.

141
00:25:54,687 --> 00:25:56,520
Who's your brother?

142
00:25:59,390 --> 00:26:00,657
Where is he?

143
00:26:01,425 --> 00:26:02,992
Where's Henry at?

144
00:26:03,994 --> 00:26:06,629
Who's your brother?
Where is he?

145
00:26:09,899 --> 00:26:13,468
You tell me where he is,
or I'm gonna kill you.

146
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:15,537
Where is he?

147
00:26:22,711 --> 00:26:24,512
There's no doctor here.

148
00:26:24,514 --> 00:26:27,348
I'm about the most useful
person in this town.

149
00:26:27,350 --> 00:26:31,085
If that gives you any idea how far
from having a doctor this town is.

150
00:26:31,087 --> 00:26:33,553
Is there a doctor
somewhere else?

151
00:26:33,555 --> 00:26:35,021
Buy something.

152
00:26:35,023 --> 00:26:39,926
I told you what I've got. I've got
tins of things and drinks and stuff.

153
00:26:40,428 --> 00:26:42,462
I have to deal with
this shit all day.

154
00:26:42,464 --> 00:26:43,730
Please.

155
00:26:43,732 --> 00:26:45,464
I'm not joking.

156
00:26:45,632 --> 00:26:48,500
You can say "please" all you like,
but I'm not joking.

157
00:26:48,502 --> 00:26:52,071
Now, pick yourself
something off the shelf.

158
00:26:57,476 --> 00:26:59,577
Pay Benny.

159
00:27:15,526 --> 00:27:18,695
There's a doctor in them
hills there. Head east,

160
00:27:18,697 --> 00:27:20,630
and follow the road
that looks like

161
00:27:20,632 --> 00:27:25,935
It's got a big yellow fridge out the front,
says "Peeples" written on it.

162
00:28:53,149 --> 00:28:55,784
Pull the gun out of your pants.

163
00:28:55,786 --> 00:28:57,752
I've got a kid in the
car who needs help.

164
00:28:57,754 --> 00:29:01,489
Pull the gun out of your pants
and put it on the ground.

165
00:29:10,765 --> 00:29:13,133
He needs help.

166
00:29:47,665 --> 00:29:49,733
Is this man your friend?

167
00:29:59,042 --> 00:30:01,077
How much do you
want for doing this?

168
00:30:01,079 --> 00:30:04,180
I don't want your money.

169
00:30:05,148 --> 00:30:10,519
I've gotten pretty good
living without money.

170
00:32:31,349 --> 00:32:34,917
I have to keep these guys locked
up in here now for the most part,

171
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:38,755
'cause people take
them for food.

172
00:32:48,765 --> 00:32:52,000
These guys came to me.

173
00:32:52,002 --> 00:32:57,139
and ask me to look after them while
they went away somewhere

174
00:32:57,141 --> 00:33:02,443
or because they had to go
somewhere or do something,

175
00:33:02,445 --> 00:33:05,246
and none of them
ever came back.

176
00:33:10,017 --> 00:33:13,987
I guess they've gone
looking for money.

177
00:33:29,169 --> 00:33:34,906
Do you want me to take
a look at your cuts?

178
00:33:41,113 --> 00:33:43,981
No.

179
00:34:27,422 --> 00:34:29,456
Hey.

180
00:34:31,993 --> 00:34:34,127
How ya going?

181
00:34:35,963 --> 00:34:37,029
I'm well.

182
00:34:38,688 --> 00:34:44,137
Um, do you wanna take a chair
while I have a look at you?

183
00:35:00,418 --> 00:35:02,386
It hurts.

184
00:35:03,522 --> 00:35:06,490
Do you want to take
your hand away?

185
00:35:06,492 --> 00:35:10,026
That doesn't look too bad.

186
00:35:11,328 --> 00:35:16,299
That looks good.
You just need to keep this clean.

187
00:35:28,111 --> 00:35:31,814
Tell me where your brother is.

188
00:35:34,950 --> 00:35:36,250
I'll take you to him.

189
00:35:38,253 --> 00:35:40,955
Tell me where your brother is.

190
00:35:45,560 --> 00:35:47,360
He's gone south a long
way from here.

191
00:35:47,362 --> 00:35:49,095
I'll take you to him, I promise.

192
00:35:50,965 --> 00:35:54,467
I'm just gonna
get you a T-shirt.

193
00:35:58,038 --> 00:35:59,438
Get up.
We're leaving.

194
00:36:02,075 --> 00:36:06,212
Maybe we should ask
what the lady says.

195
00:36:07,047 --> 00:36:09,581
Get up.

196
00:36:21,160 --> 00:36:22,626
What was that sound?

197
00:36:22,628 --> 00:36:24,228
It's a car coming.

198
00:36:24,596 --> 00:36:25,996
What car?

199
00:36:25,998 --> 00:36:27,998
I don't know.

200
00:36:30,168 --> 00:36:32,236
That's two cars.

201
00:36:32,238 --> 00:36:33,603
How long till they're here?

202
00:36:33,605 --> 00:36:36,138
A minute, maybe.

203
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:38,140
Who is it?

204
00:36:38,142 --> 00:36:40,543
Get your rifle.

205
00:36:40,545 --> 00:36:42,879
Do you know them?
Go and get your rifle.

206
00:37:11,071 --> 00:37:12,672
Tell me what's going on.

207
00:37:25,351 --> 00:37:27,252
Who are these people?

208
00:37:54,545 --> 00:37:56,012
Get up.
We're leaving.

209
00:38:21,203 --> 00:38:22,369
Get up.

210
00:39:31,701 --> 00:39:34,802
Where are we?

211
00:39:51,252 --> 00:39:53,286
I'm hungry.

212
00:40:46,202 --> 00:40:48,470
Go and get some food?

213
00:40:53,342 --> 00:40:55,610
You're gonna start talking to me.

214
00:40:57,255 --> 00:41:02,349
- What? - Don't fucking "what" me.
Where are we going?

215
00:41:03,519 --> 00:41:07,187
I can't tell you nothing more
than I already told you.

216
00:41:07,189 --> 00:41:09,189
I don't give a shit what you
think you've already told me.

217
00:41:09,191 --> 00:41:10,723
Start fucking talking to me!

218
00:41:10,725 --> 00:41:12,792
Don't.

219
00:41:12,794 --> 00:41:15,128
Do you even know
where we are?

220
00:41:15,130 --> 00:41:17,330
What?
Where are we?

221
00:41:17,698 --> 00:41:18,798
Where are we?

222
00:41:19,166 --> 00:41:20,366
I don't know.

223
00:41:20,368 --> 00:41:22,267
You don't fucking know?

224
00:41:22,269 --> 00:41:23,668
So, how are you gonna
get to where you're going

225
00:41:23,670 --> 00:41:26,771
if you don't know where
the fuck you are?

226
00:41:37,782 --> 00:41:41,919
Do you even understand
what I just said, half-wit?

227
00:41:46,790 --> 00:41:50,360
We're going to Carloon.

228
00:41:52,863 --> 00:41:55,798
We're going to Carloon.

229
00:43:21,444 --> 00:43:24,512
I just asked that lady how to
get to Carloon from here.

230
00:43:24,514 --> 00:43:29,651
I was gonna do that anyway
and you would've heard me

231
00:43:29,653 --> 00:43:32,387
and you would've
asked her what I said,

232
00:43:32,389 --> 00:43:35,022
figured out what I said anyway.

233
00:43:35,024 --> 00:43:37,558
I was gonna tell you anyway.

234
00:43:39,995 --> 00:43:43,330
You wanna know so bad.

235
00:43:45,532 --> 00:43:48,568
But you don't know exactly where
in Carloon we're going exactly,

236
00:43:48,570 --> 00:43:51,904
so, I'm still in control here.

237
00:43:56,443 --> 00:43:58,443
You don't know exactly where
in Carloon we're going,

238
00:43:58,445 --> 00:44:00,279
so you got to take
me with you.

239
00:44:04,651 --> 00:44:06,785
I'm taking you with me
because if I get to Carloon

240
00:44:06,787 --> 00:44:09,420
and your brother's not there,
I'm gonna slit your throat.

241
00:44:18,797 --> 00:44:22,999
What you want with my
brother so bad, hmm?

242
00:44:25,569 --> 00:44:28,004
Who are you?

243
00:44:30,975 --> 00:44:35,377
I'm Rey.
Is that what you mean?

244
00:44:35,379 --> 00:44:37,713
Why are you here?

245
00:44:43,019 --> 00:44:47,622
Me and my brother came out for
the mines. Like everybody else.

246
00:44:47,624 --> 00:44:50,825
Why's your brother in Carloon?

247
00:44:51,994 --> 00:44:54,529
That's where he was gonna go.

248
00:44:54,531 --> 00:44:58,332
Why are you here and your
brother's in Carloon?

249
00:45:02,437 --> 00:45:05,572
They had to get going
in a big hurry.

250
00:45:07,508 --> 00:45:09,542
Why?

251
00:45:11,411 --> 00:45:15,448
Why did he have to get
going in a big hurry?

252
00:45:18,552 --> 00:45:21,786
I don't know.
I can't talk about it.

253
00:45:22,888 --> 00:45:27,459
Why did your brother have to
get to Carloon in a big hurry?

254
00:45:31,630 --> 00:45:33,031
I can't talk about it.

255
00:45:34,367 --> 00:45:38,736
you got left here to die
while he was doing it.

256
00:45:40,672 --> 00:45:42,606
It didn't happen like that.

257
00:45:42,608 --> 00:45:44,074
Really?

258
00:45:44,542 --> 00:45:47,510
How did it happen, then?

259
00:45:51,048 --> 00:45:55,451
I can't talk about it no more,
just stop asking about everything.

260
00:45:59,589 --> 00:46:01,790
'Cause I believe in God and I
know Henry believes in God,

261
00:46:01,792 --> 00:46:04,693
and there's no harm Henry would
want to see me come to.

262
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:06,661
I believe in that.

263
00:46:07,563 --> 00:46:11,665
Yet look at the harm you've
come to and where's Henry?

264
00:46:16,405 --> 00:46:17,872
He's waiting for me.

265
00:46:18,573 --> 00:46:20,708
He's not waiting for you.

266
00:46:23,444 --> 00:46:25,779
Yes, he is.

267
00:46:25,781 --> 00:46:27,680
No, he's not.

268
00:46:28,649 --> 00:46:31,518
I'll tell you what
God's given you.

269
00:46:32,953 --> 00:46:35,120
He's put a bullet in you.

270
00:46:36,189 --> 00:46:40,426
And he's abandoned you out here to me,
who feels nothing for you.

271
00:46:41,961 --> 00:46:46,664
I couldn't give a fuck
if you die tomorrow.

272
00:46:46,666 --> 00:46:49,600
God gave you a brother
who's not waiting for you.

273
00:46:49,602 --> 00:46:53,771
He gave you a brother who's not
even thinking about you right now.

274
00:46:55,941 --> 00:47:00,076
Just because you and him came
out of the same woman's hole.

275
00:47:04,882 --> 00:47:06,650
The only thing that means
anything right now

276
00:47:06,652 --> 00:47:10,186
is that I'm here and he's not.

277
00:47:15,559 --> 00:47:18,594
Your brother left you to die.

278
00:47:18,596 --> 00:47:20,796
That's what people do.

279
00:47:23,098 --> 00:47:27,702
You don't learn to fight, your death's
gonna come real soon.

280
00:49:14,968 --> 00:49:18,170
<i>This is 5-1.
Passage is called 2-11.</i>

281
00:49:18,172 --> 00:49:20,239
<i>We should be clear
or clearing shortly.</i>

282
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:11,161
4-3-7 Echo.

283
00:52:11,796 --> 00:52:13,764
4-3-7 Echo.
This is K-K. Do you copy?

284
00:52:21,005 --> 00:52:22,772
Stop shooting!

285
00:52:33,249 --> 00:52:35,217
I just wanted to fight.

286
00:52:36,753 --> 00:52:38,920
I just wanted to fight him.

287
00:52:41,023 --> 00:52:42,157
Let's go.

288
00:52:44,327 --> 00:52:45,826
Come on.

289
00:55:50,230 --> 00:55:52,131
<i>That lady said it
would take about</i>

290
00:55:52,133 --> 00:55:53,999
<i>eight hours to get there,
in the old days.</i>

291
00:55:54,001 --> 00:55:55,601
<i>But it might take
longer now 'cause</i>

292
00:55:55,603 --> 00:55:57,335
<i>a lot of them old roads
ain't there no more.</i>

293
00:55:58,103 --> 00:56:00,071
And all the roads are
bad now anyways

294
00:56:00,073 --> 00:56:01,973
so you can't drive fast on 'em.

295
00:56:08,714 --> 00:56:11,548
She said about
eight or nine hours.

296
00:56:11,550 --> 00:56:14,217
She wasn't sure if
it was eight or nine.

297
00:56:14,219 --> 00:56:16,586
She seemed a bit
confused about it.

298
00:56:17,555 --> 00:56:18,956
And why would he
still be there?

299
00:56:23,093 --> 00:56:25,561
He had to wait two
weeks for someone.

300
00:56:26,229 --> 00:56:30,266
There's a man there he's got to meet,
it's gonna take two weeks.

301
00:56:31,435 --> 00:56:33,335
You know this?
Or this is what he told you?

302
00:56:35,237 --> 00:56:36,304
Huh?

303
00:56:38,574 --> 00:56:40,141
Your brother can't be trusted.

304
00:56:40,143 --> 00:56:42,243
Is this something
that you know

305
00:56:42,245 --> 00:56:44,279
or is this something
that he told you?

306
00:56:51,219 --> 00:56:52,753
Both those things.

307
00:57:05,499 --> 00:57:07,433
You work in the mines?

308
00:57:09,235 --> 00:57:10,335
No.

309
00:57:13,006 --> 00:57:14,639
What do you do then?

310
00:57:18,578 --> 00:57:21,245
I was a farmer.
And now I'm here.

311
00:57:26,718 --> 00:57:28,352
Then how come you learned
how to shoot so good?

312
00:57:28,354 --> 00:57:29,787
You was in the army?

313
00:57:43,334 --> 00:57:46,402
When I was a little kid
I grew up on a farm.

314
00:57:46,404 --> 00:57:51,073
We had these neighbors, real old
man and lady, Verna and Clarry,

315
00:57:51,075 --> 00:57:52,307
they's brother and sister.

316
00:57:52,309 --> 00:57:56,178
And they lived on this land
that's all overgrown,

317
00:57:56,180 --> 00:57:59,814
like you couldn't even tell what
they farmed, so overgrown.

318
00:58:01,583 --> 00:58:03,284
And Clarry had
these eight tractors,

319
00:58:03,286 --> 00:58:05,119
and none of them
worked properly,

320
00:58:05,121 --> 00:58:07,255
so every morning
he'd roll each one

321
00:58:07,257 --> 00:58:09,489
down the hill till he got
one of them started

322
00:58:09,491 --> 00:58:13,060
and then use that one to
tow all the others back up.

323
00:58:14,362 --> 00:58:16,296
He did that every day.

324
00:58:18,299 --> 00:58:20,634
And when they died, their family,
who we'd never met before,

325
00:58:20,636 --> 00:58:23,436
came around,
cleared out their house

326
00:58:24,571 --> 00:58:26,672
and they found all this...

327
00:58:27,340 --> 00:58:30,209
They found all this
weird stuff in there.

328
00:58:31,678 --> 00:58:33,144
Like...

329
00:58:35,114 --> 00:58:36,581
Like 50 therm...

330
00:58:40,453 --> 00:58:42,487
Thermionic radio valves.

331
00:58:43,622 --> 00:58:47,091
Like them real old valves
they used in old radios.

332
00:58:48,393 --> 00:58:50,727
And pyramid of pumpkins.

333
00:58:52,230 --> 00:58:56,200
And about 5,000 of these little
sticks about this long.

334
00:58:56,401 --> 00:58:59,368
And each wrapped
up in newspaper

335
00:58:59,370 --> 00:59:02,438
and tied up at the ends
with baling twine.

336
00:59:09,445 --> 00:59:11,646
Why are you telling me this?

337
00:59:14,750 --> 00:59:16,618
I just remembered it.

338
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,387
It interested me.

339
00:59:23,525 --> 00:59:26,393
Not everything has
to be about something.

340
00:59:49,516 --> 00:59:54,219
I'm tryin' to stop thinking about
that little girl who died, but I can't.

341
00:59:57,923 --> 00:59:59,490
You shouldn't.

342
01:00:02,895 --> 01:00:04,362
But I can't.

343
01:00:05,898 --> 01:00:08,599
You shouldn't stop
thinking about her.

344
01:00:11,736 --> 01:00:15,805
You should never stop thinking
about a life you've taken.

345
01:00:15,807 --> 01:00:18,475
It's the price you
pay for taking it.

346
01:02:10,711 --> 01:02:12,479
That's it, sweetheart.

347
01:02:12,481 --> 01:02:14,547
Let's start with the eyelids.

348
01:02:15,950 --> 01:02:17,751
I want you to roll
over onto your front,

349
01:02:17,753 --> 01:02:19,452
put your hands
behind your back.

350
01:02:19,454 --> 01:02:21,053
And do it slow.

351
01:02:23,523 --> 01:02:24,890
And do it now.

352
01:03:57,609 --> 01:04:00,644
<i>When are you gonna
say something, cunt?</i>

353
01:04:04,783 --> 01:04:06,417
<i>It's over.</i>

354
01:04:07,419 --> 01:04:08,952
It's over for you.

355
01:04:11,655 --> 01:04:13,123
I know that.

356
01:04:13,858 --> 01:04:16,426
That's good that you know that.

357
01:04:18,496 --> 01:04:19,729
Do you know it, too?

358
01:04:20,131 --> 01:04:21,864
Oh, I know it, champ.

359
01:04:21,866 --> 01:04:23,632
I told you it.

360
01:04:26,536 --> 01:04:29,104
Do you know it's
over for you, too?

361
01:04:31,775 --> 01:04:35,109
Whatever you think's over for
me was over a long time ago.

362
01:04:35,111 --> 01:04:36,978
I'm asking about you.

363
01:04:38,681 --> 01:04:40,648
Are you threatening me?

364
01:04:41,183 --> 01:04:42,483
No.

365
01:04:43,986 --> 01:04:47,687
A threat means there's still
something left to happen.

366
01:04:58,532 --> 01:05:00,800
What are you gonna do with me?

367
01:05:07,707 --> 01:05:09,674
You're going to Sydney.

368
01:05:12,578 --> 01:05:14,779
Why don't you just shoot me?

369
01:05:22,020 --> 01:05:23,854
Why don't you do it?

370
01:05:24,656 --> 01:05:27,224
That's what everyone
else is doing.

371
01:05:29,728 --> 01:05:34,997
tells Sydney there's a reason to
keep paying us what they pay us.

372
01:05:36,500 --> 01:05:38,668
If we just shot every idiot
we wanted to shoot,

373
01:05:38,670 --> 01:05:41,003
then pretty soon
they'd start to wonder

374
01:05:41,005 --> 01:05:43,506
what the fuck we're
doing out here.

375
01:05:46,809 --> 01:05:49,644
See, personally I don't
care about you.

376
01:05:49,646 --> 01:05:51,146
I don't care if you
get to Sydney and

377
01:05:51,148 --> 01:05:52,781
they let you off or you
bribe your way out

378
01:05:52,783 --> 01:05:54,649
or whatever the fuck they do
down there these days.

379
01:05:54,651 --> 01:05:56,685
I don't give a fuck.

380
01:05:57,752 --> 01:05:59,687
I'm doing this for me.

381
01:06:00,655 --> 01:06:02,756
You're doing what for you?

382
01:06:06,761 --> 01:06:08,862
You're doing what for you?

383
01:06:15,002 --> 01:06:16,803
I murdered my wife.

384
01:06:18,673 --> 01:06:24,009
I watched him put his fingers
inside her and I killed 'em both.

385
01:06:24,011 --> 01:06:26,111
No one ever came after me.

386
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:28,647
Ten years ago.

387
01:06:31,284 --> 01:06:33,784
I never had to explain myself.

388
01:06:35,888 --> 01:06:39,590
I never had to lie to anyone.
I never had to run and hide.

389
01:06:39,592 --> 01:06:42,660
I just buried 'em in
a hole and I went home.

390
01:06:43,128 --> 01:06:45,228
No one ever came after me.

391
01:06:46,664 --> 01:06:49,799
And that hurt me more than
getting my heart broken.

392
01:06:52,703 --> 01:06:54,771
Knowing it didn't matter.

393
01:06:58,775 --> 01:07:02,912
Knowing you can do something like
that and no one comes after you.

394
01:07:06,283 --> 01:07:10,151
You do a thing like I did, that should
really mean something.

395
01:07:12,955 --> 01:07:15,723
But it just doesn't matter anymore.

396
01:07:20,795 --> 01:07:22,062
Well, champ.

397
01:07:25,066 --> 01:07:29,202
Thing you did in Abo town is the
one thing that does matter to us.

398
01:07:32,307 --> 01:07:35,841
Now you can do all the lying and
confessing you'd like.

399
01:07:37,177 --> 01:07:40,813
What feeling do you have when you
wake up in the morning?

400
01:07:41,982 --> 01:07:44,350
When your feet
touch the floor?

401
01:07:46,018 --> 01:07:48,787
Or before that,
when you're lying there

402
01:07:48,789 --> 01:07:51,089
thinking about your
feet hitting the floor.

403
01:07:51,857 --> 01:07:54,326
What does that
feel like for you?

404
01:07:58,830 --> 01:08:00,197
Do you know what
I'm talking about?

405
01:08:00,765 --> 01:08:02,299
No, mate.
I don't.

406
01:08:02,902 --> 01:08:07,871
No, mate. I don't know what the
fuck you're talking about.

407
01:08:10,240 --> 01:08:11,641
What the fuck?

408
01:08:17,014 --> 01:08:18,081
Phew!

409
01:08:20,085 --> 01:08:21,717
Is that it?

410
01:08:24,053 --> 01:08:25,220
That was easy.

411
01:08:26,055 --> 01:08:28,657
Do I shoot him again
just to be sure?

412
01:08:29,759 --> 01:08:30,926
No.

413
01:08:30,928 --> 01:08:35,062
That was easy. There
were only three of 'em.

414
01:08:35,731 --> 01:08:38,065
Thought it was gonna
be way more harder.

415
01:08:39,901 --> 01:08:41,402
You tied up?

416
01:08:59,319 --> 01:09:01,387
I snuck up on these two.

417
01:09:01,389 --> 01:09:03,856
They were just hanging there.

418
01:09:08,294 --> 01:09:10,194
I came through the gate here.

419
01:09:21,305 --> 01:09:24,374
I dug a hole out.
Slipped underneath the fence.

420
01:09:31,983 --> 01:09:34,050
Get the truck over there.

421
01:09:38,955 --> 01:09:40,690
Come on, man.

422
01:10:26,933 --> 01:10:29,201
You want me to
drive for a while?

423
01:10:30,303 --> 01:10:31,503
No.

424
01:10:47,885 --> 01:10:50,286
I know I feel comfortable
with someone

425
01:10:50,288 --> 01:10:53,022
when I can just sit,
not talking to them.

426
01:10:54,024 --> 01:10:55,091
Yeah.

427
01:10:59,195 --> 01:11:03,065
I just like sitting there,
not talking.

428
01:11:04,300 --> 01:11:07,302
I just feel comfortable
sittin' there, you know.

429
01:11:16,945 --> 01:11:19,313
I had a pain in
my side real bad.

430
01:11:21,983 --> 01:11:24,117
It's starting to hurt.

431
01:11:26,020 --> 01:11:28,989
I think maybe I gotta
do something with it.

432
01:12:17,434 --> 01:12:19,068
Don't look bad?

433
01:12:23,105 --> 01:12:25,473
Let's put that
bandage back on.

434
01:12:29,879 --> 01:12:31,479
I think it broke, man.

435
01:13:28,499 --> 01:13:30,066
You got any fuel?

436
01:13:30,068 --> 01:13:31,301
50 US.

437
01:13:31,636 --> 01:13:33,168
50 Australian.

438
01:13:33,170 --> 01:13:34,904
US dollars.

439
01:13:34,906 --> 01:13:36,305
I'm out of US.

440
01:13:36,307 --> 01:13:38,240
I only take American money.

441
01:13:39,376 --> 01:13:41,176
What's wrong with
Australian money?

442
01:13:41,178 --> 01:13:43,178
Either take it or leave it.

443
01:13:43,180 --> 01:13:45,146
It's paper.
It's worthless.

444
01:13:46,081 --> 01:13:48,216
Yeah, whatever, mate,
I don't care.

445
01:13:48,218 --> 01:13:50,518
It's a piece of fucking paper!

446
01:13:51,120 --> 01:13:53,054
Take it or leave it.

447
01:13:53,056 --> 01:13:54,188
How much you need, man?

448
01:13:55,157 --> 01:13:56,591
50 US.

449
01:14:01,229 --> 01:14:03,030
Have you got any .38 in there?

450
01:14:03,032 --> 01:14:04,097
Yeah.

451
01:14:04,099 --> 01:14:06,166
Let me get a box of that.

452
01:14:07,335 --> 01:14:10,436
And a box of 9 millimeter
for my friend here.

453
01:14:18,679 --> 01:14:20,379
Thank you kindly.

454
01:15:21,669 --> 01:15:23,403
There's the house.

455
01:15:24,605 --> 01:15:27,007
All them others empty.

456
01:15:27,208 --> 01:15:29,709
They ain't got people
in them anymore.

457
01:15:32,313 --> 01:15:34,346
Are they alone in there?

458
01:15:37,050 --> 01:15:38,283
For now they are.

459
01:15:38,285 --> 01:15:41,086
Until them other people
come, but that ain't

460
01:15:41,088 --> 01:15:43,389
gonna be for another
week or somethin'.

461
01:15:43,790 --> 01:15:47,525
And there's Gordon,
whose house it is, but he's old.

462
01:15:47,527 --> 01:15:49,060
Real old.

463
01:15:50,229 --> 01:15:52,096
Do you know this?

464
01:15:55,067 --> 01:15:56,267
I know it.

465
01:16:02,707 --> 01:16:05,575
We'll go there in the morning.

466
01:16:05,577 --> 01:16:07,644
There'll be less trouble.

467
01:18:29,341 --> 01:18:31,276
I'm gonna kill him.

468
01:18:38,316 --> 01:18:40,417
I'm going to kill Henry.

469
01:18:45,389 --> 01:18:46,656
Go to sleep.

470
01:18:50,494 --> 01:18:53,729
There's money up there too,
we can take if we want.

471
01:19:02,338 --> 01:19:03,605
Go to sleep.

472
01:22:12,045 --> 01:22:13,779
What you doing?

473
01:22:21,587 --> 01:22:23,121
What you doing?

474
01:23:00,556 --> 01:23:02,023
Just wait there.

475
01:23:59,477 --> 01:24:00,877
They're asleep.

476
01:24:08,518 --> 01:24:11,587
There's two in the back
room. I'll take them.

477
01:24:12,856 --> 01:24:15,724
There's two in the room
on the other side.

478
01:24:17,727 --> 01:24:21,596
If you take them, we'll bring
them into this front room.

479
01:24:21,598 --> 01:24:23,531
Okay?
But no shooting.

480
01:24:23,799 --> 01:24:25,199
All right?

481
01:25:51,713 --> 01:25:53,614
Don't say a word.

482
01:25:54,049 --> 01:25:56,916
Slowly lift your
head off the pillow.

483
01:26:00,354 --> 01:26:01,888
What the fuck?

484
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:07,894
Kick your blanket off.

485
01:26:21,373 --> 01:26:23,140
Both of you get up.

486
01:26:57,906 --> 01:26:59,140
Henry.

487
01:27:01,076 --> 01:27:02,310
Henry.

488
01:27:06,782 --> 01:27:08,182
Henry, wake up.

489
01:27:13,021 --> 01:27:14,154
Rey?

490
01:27:17,191 --> 01:27:18,725
You gotta get up.

491
01:27:19,961 --> 01:27:21,761
Rey, what the fuck?

492
01:27:22,963 --> 01:27:24,363
You too, Gordon.

493
01:27:24,931 --> 01:27:28,000
You gotta get up.
You both gotta get up outta bed.

494
01:27:29,236 --> 01:27:31,937
What are you doing?
Stop pointing that thing at me.

495
01:27:32,239 --> 01:27:35,173
Don't make me keep saying it.
You got to get up out of bed.

496
01:27:38,177 --> 01:27:40,879
Sit down.
Sit.

497
01:27:46,317 --> 01:27:48,052
Sit on your hands.

498
01:27:53,091 --> 01:27:54,224
What's going on in there?

499
01:27:55,960 --> 01:27:57,393
See, Henry?

500
01:27:57,861 --> 01:27:59,929
You gotta get up outta bed.

501
01:27:59,931 --> 01:28:01,964
Rey, who's in there?

502
01:28:03,267 --> 01:28:05,368
He won't get up outta bed.

503
01:28:06,970 --> 01:28:08,437
Put the gun down, Rey.

504
01:28:11,007 --> 01:28:12,140
You put yours down.

505
01:28:12,142 --> 01:28:14,910
Rey, put the gun down.
I ain't playing.

506
01:28:15,945 --> 01:28:17,913
Why are you doing this?

507
01:28:24,086 --> 01:28:26,053
Why did you leave me there?

508
01:28:26,055 --> 01:28:27,922
Leave you where?

509
01:28:30,759 --> 01:28:33,727
You know where.
On the road, when I was shot.

510
01:28:33,729 --> 01:28:35,995
Rey, we thought you was dead.

511
01:28:35,997 --> 01:28:37,097
No.

512
01:28:37,099 --> 01:28:40,333
But I wasn't. But I wasn't dead
and you left me there.

513
01:28:40,335 --> 01:28:43,970
Rey, I thought you was dead.
Now put down the fuckin' gun!

514
01:28:45,004 --> 01:28:47,005
You put yours down.

515
01:28:47,874 --> 01:28:49,341
What's going on?

516
01:28:51,411 --> 01:28:52,978
I gotta piss.

517
01:28:52,980 --> 01:28:54,913
Don't you fuckin' move.

518
01:28:58,283 --> 01:29:00,985
I thought you was
my brother, man.

519
01:29:00,987 --> 01:29:04,822
God damn it, Rey! I am your brother.
Now put down the fuckin' gun.

520
01:29:06,492 --> 01:29:07,959
I thought you was my brother.

521
01:29:07,961 --> 01:29:11,328
Rey, if you don't put down the
gun I'm gonna shoot you.

522
01:29:11,529 --> 01:29:13,130
All right?
I ain't lyin'.

523
01:29:13,132 --> 01:29:16,900
You was supposed to be my
brother, Henry. You told Pa.

524
01:29:16,902 --> 01:29:18,969
Rey, put down the goddamn gun!

525
01:29:21,238 --> 01:29:23,372
I thought you was my brother
and you just left me there.

526
01:29:23,374 --> 01:29:24,807
What's going on in there?

527
01:30:43,447 --> 01:30:45,948
What did you do to my brother?

528
01:30:47,550 --> 01:30:48,617
Huh?

529
01:30:57,392 --> 01:30:58,993
