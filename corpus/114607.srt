1
00:00:05,138 --> 00:00:08,505
It is said that in every age,
there is one singular event...

2
00:00:08,608 --> 00:00:11,270
that forever changes the world around us.

3
00:00:11,344 --> 00:00:12,675
A nexus, if you will.

4
00:00:19,519 --> 00:00:23,182
It is said that the future
is always born in pain.

5
00:00:23,523 --> 00:00:27,050
The history of war is the history of pain.

6
00:00:27,861 --> 00:00:31,991
If we are wise, what is born of that pain...

7
00:00:32,065 --> 00:00:35,296
matures into the promise
of a better world...

8
00:00:35,368 --> 00:00:38,166
because we learn
that we can no longer afford...

9
00:00:38,238 --> 00:00:40,502
the mistakes of the past.

10
00:00:45,445 --> 00:00:48,505
But in the pain of that war,
the future was born.

11
00:00:49,416 --> 00:00:51,145
A future that would one day...

12
00:00:51,217 --> 00:00:53,947
have a name whispered
on a hundred worlds.

13
00:00:54,854 --> 00:00:57,015
A final refuge for dreams...

14
00:00:57,724 --> 00:01:01,888
and our last best hope for peace:

15
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:04,990
Babylon 5.

16
00:01:54,514 --> 00:01:56,209
Can't catch me.

17
00:02:12,265 --> 00:02:15,462
Luc? Lyssa? Where are you?

18
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:17,967
No.

19
00:02:18,338 --> 00:02:22,069
You shouldn't be here. You can't play here.

20
00:02:22,175 --> 00:02:23,938
Luc, Lyssa.

21
00:02:26,346 --> 00:02:28,246
What happened to the buildings?

22
00:02:28,314 --> 00:02:32,580
They fell down.
Some bad people made them fall down.

23
00:02:32,652 --> 00:02:36,452
That's why all the windows in the palace
are covered so you can't see.

24
00:02:37,757 --> 00:02:39,691
If they find out you've been looking...

25
00:02:39,759 --> 00:02:42,990
Then why is the window here
if you're not supposed to look?

26
00:02:43,062 --> 00:02:45,394
This is the Emperor's window, Luc.

27
00:02:45,465 --> 00:02:48,457
He's the only one who can look
out of the palace.

28
00:02:48,701 --> 00:02:51,465
That's why we can't stay.
We have to go before...

29
00:02:51,538 --> 00:02:54,507
No, it's all right.

30
00:02:55,808 --> 00:02:59,676
It's been a long time since I heard
the sound of laughter in this room.

31
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:01,336
A very long time.

32
00:03:02,849 --> 00:03:04,316
Let me see them.

33
00:03:12,892 --> 00:03:14,689
And what are your names?

34
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:17,787
Lucco Deradi. And this is my sister, Lyssa.

35
00:03:18,598 --> 00:03:20,862
She doesn't talk much, does she?

36
00:03:21,034 --> 00:03:23,161
No, she's always quiet.

37
00:03:23,236 --> 00:03:25,363
We think maybe
there's something wrong with her.

38
00:03:25,438 --> 00:03:28,669
Yes. Or something very right.

39
00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:34,473
The quiet ones are the ones
that change the universe, Luc Deradi.

40
00:03:35,548 --> 00:03:38,984
The loud ones only take the credit.

41
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:45,455
Are you really the Emperor?

42
00:03:46,993 --> 00:03:49,393
I sometimes ask myself the same thing.

43
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,831
Yes, I am the Emperor.

44
00:03:54,334 --> 00:03:56,962
Here, you see?

45
00:03:57,704 --> 00:04:00,434
This is the seal of the Centauri Republic.

46
00:04:00,506 --> 00:04:02,406
Only the Emperor can wear it.

47
00:04:02,475 --> 00:04:06,878
So, either I am the Emperor,
or I am in a great deal of trouble.

48
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:09,074
Or both.

49
00:04:11,017 --> 00:04:12,314
Come here, you.

50
00:04:14,921 --> 00:04:17,389
For the next five minutes...

51
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:22,750
you are the Emperor of what was once
the vast Centauri Republic.

52
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:28,064
You may give one order.

53
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,228
Any order you desire.

54
00:04:31,504 --> 00:04:33,233
Make it a good one.

55
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:38,136
What do you want?

56
00:04:39,112 --> 00:04:40,272
Tell me a story.

57
00:04:40,346 --> 00:04:42,712
No, no. It's all right.

58
00:04:43,516 --> 00:04:46,246
He did far better with that question
than I did.

59
00:04:47,287 --> 00:04:50,085
What kind of story would you like to hear?

60
00:04:54,727 --> 00:04:59,596
I want a story about great battles and
wars and bravery and heroes and villains!

61
00:05:00,433 --> 00:05:01,627
I see.

62
00:05:04,037 --> 00:05:06,028
And what does your sister want?

63
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:07,367
Nothing.

64
00:05:09,776 --> 00:05:12,176
She says she wants to hear a true story.

65
00:05:13,146 --> 00:05:14,579
Very well.

66
00:05:15,081 --> 00:05:18,244
Then I will give you both what you want.

67
00:05:18,818 --> 00:05:21,616
A story about great deeds...

68
00:05:22,221 --> 00:05:25,952
about armies of light
and soldiers of darkness.

69
00:05:26,459 --> 00:05:29,826
About the places
where they lived and fought...

70
00:05:30,263 --> 00:05:32,390
and loved and died.

71
00:05:33,366 --> 00:05:37,427
About great empires, terrible mistakes.

72
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:40,830
A true story.

73
00:05:43,676 --> 00:05:48,306
You see,
I was there at the dawn of the Third Age.

74
00:05:49,816 --> 00:05:51,909
It began with the Humans.

75
00:05:53,619 --> 00:05:57,111
They are the quiet ones
I mentioned before.

76
00:05:57,557 --> 00:05:59,787
They changed the universe...

77
00:05:59,859 --> 00:06:02,555
but in doing so paid a terrible price.

78
00:06:03,496 --> 00:06:07,364
It began 35 of their years ago.

79
00:06:08,701 --> 00:06:11,693
Their homeworld is a place called Earth...

80
00:06:12,372 --> 00:06:15,967
Iocated in a fairly uninteresting part
of the galaxy.

81
00:06:16,042 --> 00:06:18,772
We had never bothered much
with that area before.

82
00:06:18,845 --> 00:06:21,939
It had little military or strategic value.

83
00:06:22,582 --> 00:06:25,050
But as a culture grows decadent...

84
00:06:25,451 --> 00:06:29,478
it becomes intrigued by art...

85
00:06:29,989 --> 00:06:32,219
by trinkets, by eccentricity.

86
00:06:32,625 --> 00:06:36,584
And the Humans had art and trinkets...

87
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:39,096
and eccentricity to spare.

88
00:06:41,067 --> 00:06:43,035
But it was none of those traits...

89
00:06:43,102 --> 00:06:45,662
that would cause so much death and pain.

90
00:06:46,305 --> 00:06:48,170
They have an expression:

91
00:06:48,841 --> 00:06:52,072
"Pride goeth before a fall."

92
00:06:53,079 --> 00:06:55,673
And their pride was their undoing.

93
00:06:56,449 --> 00:06:58,041
I know.

94
00:06:58,718 --> 00:07:00,413
I was there.

95
00:07:00,787 --> 00:07:03,312
Mollari, good.

96
00:07:03,656 --> 00:07:05,487
I'd like you to meet General Lefcourt.

97
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:08,288
Londo Mollari,
liaison to the Centauri delegation.

98
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:10,386
- Pleasure to meet you, sir.
- Likewise.

99
00:07:10,463 --> 00:07:11,521
Please, sit.

100
00:07:11,597 --> 00:07:14,327
- How is your president? Well, I hope.
- Much better.

101
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:15,799
I just saw her in the red room.

102
00:07:15,868 --> 00:07:18,564
She's starting to get some of the color
back in her cheeks.

103
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,765
This damn flu's got half of my staff
down sick.

104
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,105
I suggest you give her a little of this
before she eats.

105
00:07:24,477 --> 00:07:27,708
I brought it from Centauri Prime
when I heard she was ill.

106
00:07:28,047 --> 00:07:32,575
It will completely eliminate her symptoms
in two, three hours at most.

107
00:07:32,652 --> 00:07:35,120
Thank you. I'm sure she'll appreciate it.

108
00:07:35,188 --> 00:07:36,712
My pleasure.

109
00:07:37,457 --> 00:07:42,417
Now, gentlemen, perhaps you will tell me
why you have arranged for this meeting.

110
00:07:42,628 --> 00:07:43,754
Of course.

111
00:07:43,830 --> 00:07:45,024
General?

112
00:07:46,499 --> 00:07:50,435
Following our victory against the Dilgar,
we've taken advantage of the good will...

113
00:07:50,503 --> 00:07:53,370
of other worlds to expand our sphere
of influence.

114
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:56,207
We've made trade deals
and mutual defense treaties...

115
00:07:56,275 --> 00:07:58,573
with the League of Non-Aligned Worlds.

116
00:07:59,011 --> 00:08:02,276
Most of the races
have been very receptive to our advances.

117
00:08:02,448 --> 00:08:04,177
Others, downright hostile.

118
00:08:04,450 --> 00:08:07,886
And a few are still a mystery to us.

119
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:13,052
What do you know
about a race called Minbari?

120
00:08:15,828 --> 00:08:18,490
We have had some dealings with them
in the past...

121
00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:21,032
but nothing in recent years. Why?

122
00:08:21,467 --> 00:08:23,492
We'll send an expedition to their border...

123
00:08:23,569 --> 00:08:26,868
to see if they threaten our program
to expand our sphere of influence.

124
00:08:26,939 --> 00:08:31,103
We understand that fully a third
of their population is dedicated to warfare.

125
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:34,236
They have a warrior caste.
Not exactly the same thing?

126
00:08:34,847 --> 00:08:37,645
Semantics.
We need to know all we can about them.

127
00:08:38,885 --> 00:08:42,377
Then send one ship. One ship only.

128
00:08:42,755 --> 00:08:45,246
Anything more could be perceived
as a threat.

129
00:08:45,324 --> 00:08:47,224
And if that were to happen...

130
00:08:47,293 --> 00:08:49,693
I assure you
they would never return home.

131
00:08:49,762 --> 00:08:51,161
My people can handle themselves.

132
00:08:51,230 --> 00:08:53,960
We took care of the Dilgar,
we can take care of the Minbari.

133
00:08:54,033 --> 00:08:57,059
Arrogance and stupidity
all in the same package.

134
00:08:57,136 --> 00:08:58,364
How efficient of you.

135
00:08:58,437 --> 00:09:00,234
- Just a minute...
- Listen to me.

136
00:09:00,306 --> 00:09:03,434
The Minbari are one
of the oldest spacefaring races.

137
00:09:03,676 --> 00:09:06,110
Even at the height
of the Centauri Republic...

138
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:08,339
when we were expanding
in all directions...

139
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,644
we never opposed the Minbari.

140
00:09:10,950 --> 00:09:15,216
If you do not bother them,
they will not bother you.

141
00:09:15,288 --> 00:09:18,052
Perhaps.
But that decision's already been made.

142
00:09:18,124 --> 00:09:20,854
All we're asking is that you give us
whatever you've got...

143
00:09:20,927 --> 00:09:24,363
on the location of their military forces
so we can avoid contact.

144
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:26,921
- No, this is foolish.
- Excuse me for saying so...

145
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:30,958
but it sounds like you're concerned with
keeping your monopoly on our business.

146
00:09:31,037 --> 00:09:34,996
Minbari have no interest in alien affairs
or alien business.

147
00:09:35,308 --> 00:09:37,208
And I resent your implication.

148
00:09:38,144 --> 00:09:40,635
I've tried to help you.
You've refused to listen.

149
00:09:40,713 --> 00:09:41,975
There you are.

150
00:09:42,682 --> 00:09:46,812
I will get you the information you ask for,
and that is the end.

151
00:09:47,486 --> 00:09:49,852
Good luck with your mission, gentlemen.

152
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:54,557
I only hope
that in your stumbling around...

153
00:09:54,627 --> 00:09:56,618
you do not wake the dragon.

154
00:09:56,696 --> 00:09:57,685
Good day.

155
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:05,126
They didn't listen, of course.
Arrogant men never do.

156
00:10:06,472 --> 00:10:09,873
Sadly, arrogance has never been...

157
00:10:10,509 --> 00:10:12,477
exclusively a Human trait.

158
00:10:13,179 --> 00:10:16,273
It travels between the stars
like solar winds.

159
00:10:30,262 --> 00:10:32,662
I never tire of this view, Lenonn.

160
00:10:32,732 --> 00:10:36,259
It amazes me to think that Valen himself
stood where I am standing...

161
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:37,962
so many years ago.

162
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:42,300
Yes. I often feel his presence here.

163
00:10:44,110 --> 00:10:46,374
Thank you for coming, Callier.

164
00:10:46,445 --> 00:10:48,936
I'm honored that you should travel so far.

165
00:10:49,248 --> 00:10:53,150
It is the least I can do
for the honored leader of the Anla-Shok.

166
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,656
I'm not certain about the "honored" part.
I know what they say about me.

167
00:10:59,859 --> 00:11:02,123
You've been listening to rumors again.

168
00:11:02,194 --> 00:11:06,358
Rangers specialize in reports
from distant places.

169
00:11:06,432 --> 00:11:08,764
Rumors are at the core of what we do.

170
00:11:09,335 --> 00:11:13,237
I've learned that the more vehemently
a rumor is denied...

171
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,830
the more often it tends to be true.

172
00:11:17,376 --> 00:11:22,313
So, did you pass on my request
for more support?

173
00:11:22,815 --> 00:11:25,875
I did. It was considered and rejected.

174
00:11:25,951 --> 00:11:27,248
They promised!

175
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,184
Lenonn, be sensible.

176
00:11:29,255 --> 00:11:32,247
We have carried the Rangers
as part of our cultural identity...

177
00:11:32,324 --> 00:11:35,316
our debt to Valen, for 1,000 years.

178
00:11:35,394 --> 00:11:37,225
How much more can you ask of us?

179
00:11:37,296 --> 00:11:42,233
But now is when the prophecies said
that we would be needed most.

180
00:11:42,334 --> 00:11:45,360
- We must begin to move.
- I'm sorry, Lenonn.

181
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:48,296
The Caste Elders have made their decision.

182
00:11:50,543 --> 00:11:53,569
Then I demand to speak
with the Grey Council.

183
00:11:53,846 --> 00:11:54,870
Lenonn...

184
00:11:54,947 --> 00:11:58,405
It is my right as leader of the Anla-Shok.

185
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:02,420
I demand to see them
and make my case personally.

186
00:12:02,621 --> 00:12:05,852
If you go over the heads of the Elders,
you risk offending them.

187
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:09,053
Then let them be offended.

188
00:12:09,495 --> 00:12:12,191
You operate here at our sufferance,
Lenonn.

189
00:12:12,798 --> 00:12:16,290
If you force the issue,
the Rangers may pay the price.

190
00:12:17,837 --> 00:12:22,831
Ignore my request, and we shall all pay
the price for their stupidity.

191
00:13:01,447 --> 00:13:03,677
Have you come from the Grey Council?

192
00:13:05,651 --> 00:13:06,675
Wait.

193
00:13:06,752 --> 00:13:08,344
I want to speak with you.

194
00:13:19,498 --> 00:13:20,988
Where are you going?

195
00:13:22,768 --> 00:13:24,668
Why won't you answer me?

196
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,271
Well, Lenonn?

197
00:14:44,783 --> 00:14:47,251
You said you wished to speak with us.

198
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:52,417
Step into the circle and speak.

199
00:14:56,562 --> 00:14:58,655
You said there was going to be a battle.

200
00:14:58,731 --> 00:15:00,198
Excuse me?

201
00:15:00,266 --> 00:15:02,996
You said there was going to be
a great battle in your story.

202
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,662
- Luc, be quiet.
- No, no, it's all right.

203
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:10,069
The young do not understand that in war
there is death.

204
00:15:11,110 --> 00:15:13,101
You want a battle?

205
00:15:13,178 --> 00:15:17,046
Would it help to tell you
that these two isolated incidents...

206
00:15:17,116 --> 00:15:20,677
would lead to the greatest war
in Human history?

207
00:15:20,753 --> 00:15:21,845
Yes.

208
00:15:22,354 --> 00:15:26,848
Many Minbari would die in the war,
but before its end...

209
00:15:27,359 --> 00:15:32,319
Earth herself would stand
on the very edge of complete destruction.

210
00:15:34,700 --> 00:15:36,463
And the irony is...

211
00:15:41,607 --> 00:15:45,873
the terrible truth that no one knows,
but that I will tell you...

212
00:15:47,813 --> 00:15:52,773
is that the blood of many who died
in that war is on my hands.

213
00:15:53,886 --> 00:15:55,114
My fault.

214
00:15:57,289 --> 00:15:58,517
My fault.

215
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:08,429
Majesty,
I know it is not my place to speak...

216
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:12,027
but you have endured so much
these last few years.

217
00:16:12,104 --> 00:16:16,268
You cannot bear the blame for the war
between the Humans and the Minbari.

218
00:16:16,342 --> 00:16:18,572
We had nothing to do with it.

219
00:16:19,211 --> 00:16:21,975
Thank you, but I know my sins,
dear woman.

220
00:16:22,381 --> 00:16:25,077
And the price
I will eventually pay for them.

221
00:16:26,885 --> 00:16:29,479
Now, young Emperor.

222
00:16:30,356 --> 00:16:35,020
I was telling you about how Lenonn,
head of the Anla-Shok...

223
00:16:35,094 --> 00:16:38,291
what the Humans would one day
call the Rangers...

224
00:16:38,364 --> 00:16:41,299
was brought before the Grey Council.

225
00:16:44,236 --> 00:16:45,601
Long ago...

226
00:16:46,338 --> 00:16:50,536
Valen led our people to victory...

227
00:16:50,743 --> 00:16:53,234
in the Great War against the Shadows.

228
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:55,671
Before he went away...

229
00:16:55,748 --> 00:16:59,809
he gave us the prophecy that
they would return again in 1,000 years.

230
00:16:59,885 --> 00:17:03,719
That time is almost upon us.

231
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:06,019
And the Rangers...

232
00:17:06,091 --> 00:17:09,788
who were created to be our eyes
and ears on the frontier...

233
00:17:09,862 --> 00:17:14,128
to watch for the return
of the great darkness, are not ready.

234
00:17:15,334 --> 00:17:17,199
There are only a few of us.

235
00:17:18,971 --> 00:17:23,931
And most of those are old and tired
from years of watching, waiting.

236
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:27,808
Weary of being mocked...

237
00:17:27,913 --> 00:17:30,905
by certain members of this Council...

238
00:17:33,619 --> 00:17:35,712
and by the Warrior Caste...

239
00:17:37,156 --> 00:17:40,125
who think of us as an embarrassment...

240
00:17:40,692 --> 00:17:43,991
and who do not believe
in the prophecy of Valen.

241
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:48,191
This prophecy also said
that the Anla-Shok will arise.

242
00:17:48,267 --> 00:17:51,703
They will be ready and they will be
instrumental in the next great war.

243
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:54,398
So, why not wait until there's proof?

244
00:17:54,473 --> 00:17:57,806
Valen created the Grey Council
from members of every caste...

245
00:17:57,876 --> 00:17:59,503
warrior, worker and religious...

246
00:17:59,578 --> 00:18:03,742
so that no one caste would have
undue influence over the others.

247
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:08,753
Prophecy falls under the category
of religion, Lenonn.

248
00:18:09,254 --> 00:18:12,280
The workers need to know
why they should stop building bridges...

249
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:15,292
and start building ships,
guns and weapons.

250
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,319
And the warriors need to know
why they may be called upon to serve...

251
00:18:19,398 --> 00:18:20,797
and to die.

252
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:23,830
What do you say to them?

253
00:18:24,203 --> 00:18:28,333
All I can say is that I believe.

254
00:18:28,407 --> 00:18:30,671
What more is there to say?

255
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:36,570
We need money, resources, people.

256
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:42,480
And we must attempt a rapprochement
with the Vorlons.

257
00:18:45,190 --> 00:18:47,055
Coplann...

258
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:49,993
what does the Warrior Caste find
so amusing?

259
00:18:58,770 --> 00:19:03,070
Over the last 100 years, we've sent
a dozen ships into Vorlon space.

260
00:19:04,042 --> 00:19:06,374
None has returned.

261
00:19:07,312 --> 00:19:12,306
To send more would be a waste of time
and effort and lives.

262
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:18,187
The Vorlons know the prophecy
as well as you.

263
00:19:18,257 --> 00:19:21,624
Yet they have not come forth
to contact us.

264
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:26,630
Because they know that we have fallen
from grace...

265
00:19:26,832 --> 00:19:29,062
and that we no longer believe.

266
00:19:29,568 --> 00:19:34,562
Then let them appear to give us something
to believe in.

267
00:19:35,841 --> 00:19:40,835
If the Vorlons do not see the danger,
then perhaps the danger does not exist.

268
00:19:41,880 --> 00:19:43,404
Master...

269
00:19:46,185 --> 00:19:47,709
If I may...

270
00:19:49,454 --> 00:19:53,390
There may be a way to give the others
the proof they require.

271
00:19:53,458 --> 00:19:56,484
Delenn is not formally a part
of this Council.

272
00:19:57,162 --> 00:20:01,428
Though she stands in for Satai Kadroni,
she has not yet undergone the ritual.

273
00:20:01,500 --> 00:20:05,095
It is inappropriate for her to speak.

274
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:11,773
I have never yet known the truth or Delenn
to speak only when it is appropriate.

275
00:20:12,544 --> 00:20:14,102
Go on, Delenn.

276
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:21,476
Valen said the Shadows...

277
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:25,614
would first return to their homeworld
of Z'ha'dum before moving against us.

278
00:20:25,857 --> 00:20:28,883
So, why not send an expedition
to Z'ha'dum...

279
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:31,725
to determine if they have indeed returned?

280
00:20:31,797 --> 00:20:34,459
The Warrior Caste will be no part of this.

281
00:20:34,533 --> 00:20:37,661
Our forces are needed here
to protect homeworld.

282
00:20:37,736 --> 00:20:41,900
Besides, the journey is long and difficult.

283
00:20:42,674 --> 00:20:46,405
Other expeditions have found that the area
around Z'ha'dum is mined...

284
00:20:46,478 --> 00:20:50,471
with traps and ancient defense systems.

285
00:20:50,549 --> 00:20:53,814
Other races have moved in,
claimed it as their own.

286
00:20:55,387 --> 00:20:58,754
So, you believe it too dangerous
for the Warrior Caste to go.

287
00:21:01,126 --> 00:21:03,253
The Warrior Caste fears nothing.

288
00:21:05,230 --> 00:21:07,391
But it is a waste of our time.

289
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:11,532
Further, if the Council endorses
such an expedition...

290
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,104
it would cause unnecessary panic
among our people.

291
00:21:15,340 --> 00:21:16,830
I agree.

292
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:19,333
So, they will not have to go.

293
00:21:20,212 --> 00:21:21,338
Thank you.

294
00:21:21,413 --> 00:21:22,710
We will go.

295
00:21:22,781 --> 00:21:25,011
What? But, Master...

296
00:21:25,083 --> 00:21:28,883
We are the ones who must decide
how much support to give the Rangers.

297
00:21:28,954 --> 00:21:32,515
We can rely on the reports of others,
or see for ourselves.

298
00:21:32,591 --> 00:21:35,287
My whole life...

299
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:40,320
I have heard of Z'ha'dum
in whispers and legends.

300
00:21:43,335 --> 00:21:45,963
I think I'd like to see it once before I die.

301
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:47,932
Wouldn't you, Delenn?

302
00:21:49,107 --> 00:21:50,972
Yes, Master.

303
00:21:52,210 --> 00:21:53,973
Then we will go.

304
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:55,946
We will take only a few support vessels...

305
00:21:56,014 --> 00:22:00,314
sworn to secrecy to avoid the panic
Coplann fears.

306
00:22:00,385 --> 00:22:03,115
And we'll travel indirectly...

307
00:22:03,188 --> 00:22:06,988
stopping at various outposts
until we are ready for the final jump.

308
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:11,087
It is an elegant and simple solution,
Coplann.

309
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:14,622
Thank you for giving it to me.

310
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:29,744
You have something on your mind, Delenn.
I recognize that expression.

311
00:22:29,815 --> 00:22:31,214
I was only thinking...

312
00:22:31,283 --> 00:22:35,242
I believe that Lenonn is correct,
and that we must begin to prepare.

313
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:37,288
But Coplann is also correct.

314
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:39,415
The Vorlons should have contacted us
by now.

315
00:22:39,491 --> 00:22:41,356
Yes, they should.

316
00:22:41,426 --> 00:22:44,020
But if the legends surrounding
the Vorlons are correct...

317
00:22:44,096 --> 00:22:48,499
remember that they do not reveal
themselves quickly and never all at once.

318
00:22:49,167 --> 00:22:50,725
What are you saying?

319
00:22:50,836 --> 00:22:53,100
I'm not saying anything.

320
00:22:53,171 --> 00:22:56,538
I didn't say anything then,
and I am not saying anything now.

321
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:59,408
It's been a long day
and I must go to my sanctum...

322
00:22:59,478 --> 00:23:01,469
and meditate on this in private.

323
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:04,714
Good day, Delenn.

324
00:23:39,017 --> 00:23:40,541
Now, it starts.

325
00:23:44,089 --> 00:23:45,420
Yes.

326
00:23:50,729 --> 00:23:52,128
You wanted to see me, sir?

327
00:23:52,197 --> 00:23:54,461
Yes. Come in, Commander. Have a seat.

328
00:23:57,936 --> 00:23:59,426
How's your father?

329
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,768
He's fine, sir. He sends his regards.

330
00:24:01,940 --> 00:24:04,636
He asked me to remind you, respectfully...

331
00:24:04,709 --> 00:24:07,337
that you still owe him 40 credits
from last week.

332
00:24:07,412 --> 00:24:09,539
Yes, yes. I'll get it to him eventually.

333
00:24:10,482 --> 00:24:14,475
It's a sad state of affairs when
a fine diplomat has to resort to cheating...

334
00:24:14,553 --> 00:24:16,350
at poker.

335
00:24:16,855 --> 00:24:20,382
I can't think of any other way
the man could've beat me.

336
00:24:21,626 --> 00:24:25,323
I have an opportunity for you, Commander,
and I suggest you take it.

337
00:24:26,198 --> 00:24:29,599
We're sending out a mission
to the border of Minbari space.

338
00:24:29,668 --> 00:24:32,660
The ships involved will survey
the disposition of their forces...

339
00:24:32,737 --> 00:24:36,366
and determine if the Minbari
have any hostile intentions towards us.

340
00:24:36,441 --> 00:24:38,909
I want you on that ship as first officer.

341
00:24:39,244 --> 00:24:41,007
I'm already assigned to the Lexington.

342
00:24:41,079 --> 00:24:44,048
The Lexington is an old patrol ship
that'll never fight again...

343
00:24:44,115 --> 00:24:46,948
if Captain Sterns has anything
to say about it.

344
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:51,580
He wants to finish his tour and retire with
his parts and pieces still in working order.

345
00:24:51,656 --> 00:24:55,353
He's a good man and a fine officer.
He's loyal to his crew.

346
00:24:55,894 --> 00:24:58,454
I feel I have an obligation to return
that loyalty.

347
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,464
I appreciate that.

348
00:25:00,532 --> 00:25:03,933
But career advancement depends
upon high visibility assignments.

349
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,129
This is an important mission.

350
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:09,298
When it's over, you'll be that much closer
to your own command.

351
00:25:09,374 --> 00:25:11,934
Can I ask what ship is leading
the expedition?

352
00:25:12,010 --> 00:25:13,307
The Prometheus.

353
00:25:13,378 --> 00:25:16,404
Captain Jankowski lost his X O
to the Churchill two weeks ago...

354
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:20,383
and has been looking for a replacement.
You would fit in perfectly.

355
00:25:20,452 --> 00:25:23,387
I know some of the officers
who have served under him.

356
00:25:23,455 --> 00:25:26,754
He doesn't handle first contact situations
as well as others.

357
00:25:26,825 --> 00:25:28,383
Ever since the Omega incident...

358
00:25:28,460 --> 00:25:32,089
The military tribunal cleared him
of all responsibility for what happened.

359
00:25:32,163 --> 00:25:35,530
Yes, I understand that.
But if I can speak frankly...

360
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:39,561
The men under his command
consider him a loose cannon.

361
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:42,167
I'd rather not walk into a situation...

362
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,403
where I might have to go up
against my own CO if things got hot.

363
00:25:45,477 --> 00:25:48,002
Don't misunderstand me.
I appreciate the effort, General.

364
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:52,072
And you're right. This is a plum
assignment and a fast-track to promotion.

365
00:25:52,250 --> 00:25:54,718
I can't leave Captain Sterns in the lurch.

366
00:25:54,786 --> 00:25:58,313
And I don't really feel comfortable
with the situation on the Prometheus.

367
00:25:58,390 --> 00:26:01,382
Sheridan, you are the most stubborn man
I have ever seen.

368
00:26:01,459 --> 00:26:03,450
And mainly at your own expense.

369
00:26:04,262 --> 00:26:05,354
All right.

370
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:08,991
If you want to shoot your career
in the foot, who am I to stand in the way?

371
00:26:09,067 --> 00:26:10,261
Dismissed.

372
00:26:10,602 --> 00:26:11,796
Yes, sir.

373
00:26:44,636 --> 00:26:45,796
Excuse me.

374
00:26:46,471 --> 00:26:48,200
Did you just pilot in that transport?

375
00:26:48,273 --> 00:26:49,399
Yes.

376
00:26:49,474 --> 00:26:51,840
It is dangerous to deliver cargo
while in hyperspace.

377
00:26:51,910 --> 00:26:53,844
Why did your crew
take such an unusual risk?

378
00:26:53,912 --> 00:26:56,005
I do not ask questions,
I only follow orders.

379
00:26:56,081 --> 00:26:57,070
Whose orders?

380
00:26:57,248 --> 00:26:58,977
I'm told they came from Dukhat himself.

381
00:26:59,050 --> 00:27:01,985
The deliveries must not attract
undue attention from outsiders.

382
00:27:02,053 --> 00:27:03,384
But why the secrecy?

383
00:27:03,455 --> 00:27:05,389
I don't know.

384
00:27:05,457 --> 00:27:08,290
Once each week we are given
a different rendezvous point.

385
00:27:08,360 --> 00:27:09,793
We wait, and a ship arrives.

386
00:27:09,861 --> 00:27:13,319
They transfer cargo to our ship,
and we bring it here. That's all I know.

387
00:27:13,398 --> 00:27:15,559
You must have some information
about your cargo.

388
00:27:15,634 --> 00:27:17,534
Something to do with
life-support systems...

389
00:27:17,602 --> 00:27:19,900
alternate atmospheres, that's all I know.

390
00:27:19,971 --> 00:27:22,462
- What kind of alternate atmosphere?
- Delenn!

391
00:27:24,509 --> 00:27:27,376
It is almost time for the ceremony.
You're not prepared.

392
00:27:27,445 --> 00:27:30,380
Are you reconsidering the invitation
to join the Grey Council?

393
00:27:30,448 --> 00:27:33,645
No, of course not.
How could you even ask such a...

394
00:27:33,718 --> 00:27:36,653
Because a member of the Grey Council
wouldn't bother herself...

395
00:27:36,721 --> 00:27:39,952
with such trivial details
as cargo shipments and transports.

396
00:27:40,025 --> 00:27:41,788
No, Master, of course not.

397
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,625
Except when it may involve larger issues.

398
00:27:46,464 --> 00:27:51,458
You see, only an alien life form
would require an alternate atmosphere.

399
00:27:52,170 --> 00:27:53,467
What of it?

400
00:27:53,538 --> 00:27:55,665
I was only thinking
of what you said earlier...

401
00:27:55,740 --> 00:27:58,265
and remembering that from time to time...

402
00:27:58,343 --> 00:28:01,801
aliens have come to us
pretending to be Vorlons.

403
00:28:01,880 --> 00:28:06,180
Since no one alive has ever seen them,
it's easy to be deceived.

404
00:28:06,451 --> 00:28:08,578
Are you saying I'm being deceived?

405
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:10,988
I'm not saying anything.

406
00:28:11,056 --> 00:28:14,492
I did not say anything then,
and I'm not saying anything now.

407
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:19,790
Unless you are saying
you've seen a Vorlon.

408
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:23,825
I am saying even less than you.
Except for this:

409
00:28:25,403 --> 00:28:29,100
When the darkness comes, if you
ever have doubt about your actions...

410
00:28:29,174 --> 00:28:32,701
all you need to do is look into the face
of a Vorlon.

411
00:28:32,777 --> 00:28:36,008
Once you see that,
all doubt is erased forever.

412
00:28:36,081 --> 00:28:40,211
Now we must hurry,
or you'll be late for your own ceremony.

413
00:28:54,399 --> 00:28:56,128
Approaching next rendezvous point.

414
00:28:56,201 --> 00:28:57,429
Very good.

415
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,429
Prepare to jump to normal space.

416
00:29:01,272 --> 00:29:03,172
Navigation, prepare to jump.

417
00:29:03,241 --> 00:29:04,333
Roger that, Bridge.

418
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:06,809
Jump engines standing by
at your command.

419
00:29:07,712 --> 00:29:08,701
Jump.

420
00:29:32,070 --> 00:29:34,095
Why do you come here, Delenn?

421
00:29:34,472 --> 00:29:35,905
I come to serve.

422
00:29:36,341 --> 00:29:37,501
Who do you serve?

423
00:29:37,575 --> 00:29:38,940
I serve the truth.

424
00:29:39,344 --> 00:29:40,834
What is the truth?

425
00:29:41,546 --> 00:29:44,208
That we are one people, one voice.

426
00:29:44,282 --> 00:29:47,251
Will you follow me to fire?
Will you follow me to darkness?

427
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:49,479
Will you follow me to death?

428
00:29:49,921 --> 00:29:51,354
I will.

429
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:53,323
Then follow.

430
00:30:13,411 --> 00:30:17,040
Sir, we're picking up a silhouette
at the edge of scanner range.

431
00:30:17,982 --> 00:30:21,816
I thought this area was supposed to be
well outside the Minbari transfer points.

432
00:30:21,886 --> 00:30:23,410
Aye, sir. It is.

433
00:30:23,488 --> 00:30:25,786
There's no reason they should be here.

434
00:30:26,057 --> 00:30:28,048
Unless they're looking for us.

435
00:30:28,126 --> 00:30:29,616
Should we jump back to hyperspace?

436
00:30:29,694 --> 00:30:31,491
Negative. We just jumped in.

437
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:34,498
I don't want to put more strain
on the engines than we have to.

438
00:30:34,566 --> 00:30:38,229
Besides, if it is them,
I want to see if we can get a look at them.

439
00:30:38,403 --> 00:30:41,429
Captain, our orders were to avoid
any first contact situation...

440
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,269
unless authorized to do so.

441
00:30:43,341 --> 00:30:45,400
I'm well aware of our orders, Commander.

442
00:30:45,476 --> 00:30:49,105
Now take us in at oblique angle,
keep the scanners on the maximum.

443
00:30:49,180 --> 00:30:52,638
If we do this right,
they're not even going to know we're here.

444
00:30:53,051 --> 00:30:54,279
Aye, sir.

445
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:59,112
I am become Grey.

446
00:31:00,191 --> 00:31:05,094
I stand between the darkness
and the light.

447
00:31:11,669 --> 00:31:16,231
Between the candle and the star.

448
00:31:26,050 --> 00:31:29,747
Scanners confirm target
is unknown vessel.

449
00:31:29,821 --> 00:31:32,847
We read two primary vessels
and several support ships.

450
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:34,922
Let me see it.

451
00:31:38,863 --> 00:31:41,024
That's all we've got so far?
Just a silhouette?

452
00:31:41,099 --> 00:31:42,964
Scanners are having a hard time
locking on.

453
00:31:43,034 --> 00:31:45,867
They may be using some sort
of stealth technology.

454
00:31:45,937 --> 00:31:47,404
Is there any hostile action yet?

455
00:31:47,472 --> 00:31:49,133
Negative, sir.

456
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:51,698
They still may not have noticed us yet.

457
00:31:52,310 --> 00:31:53,971
Bring us in closer.

458
00:31:54,045 --> 00:31:56,513
I want as much information as we can get.

459
00:31:56,748 --> 00:31:58,545
Sir, our orders are to avoid...

460
00:31:58,616 --> 00:32:02,211
They are to bring back information
on the Minbari and that's what we'll do.

461
00:32:02,287 --> 00:32:04,380
If we bring back a profile on a warship...

462
00:32:04,455 --> 00:32:06,355
they'll be handing out medals
by the bucket.

463
00:32:06,424 --> 00:32:09,689
We handled the Dilgar,
and we can handle a few stray ships.

464
00:32:10,561 --> 00:32:13,428
Now, bring us in closer.

465
00:32:14,632 --> 00:32:15,929
Aye, sir.

466
00:32:25,643 --> 00:32:30,205
The sensors have detected an echo
which seems to be following our course.

467
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:33,315
They may be alien ships on approach.

468
00:32:33,384 --> 00:32:37,718
I've told them to go to maximum power
on the scanners so we can verify.

469
00:32:38,089 --> 00:32:41,820
There's no reason to concern Dukhat
with it until we know more.

470
00:32:51,336 --> 00:32:53,930
Sir, alien ships are changing course.

471
00:32:55,640 --> 00:32:57,631
Moving in our direction.

472
00:32:58,242 --> 00:32:59,903
I'm picking up scanners.

473
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:03,470
Extremely powerful.
I've never seen anything like them.

474
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:04,639
They've seen us!

475
00:33:04,716 --> 00:33:07,276
All right, let's get out of here.
Prepare to jump.

476
00:33:07,352 --> 00:33:09,684
- Jump engines not responding.
- What?

477
00:33:09,787 --> 00:33:12,813
Alien scanner arrays interfering
with our electrical systems.

478
00:33:12,890 --> 00:33:14,482
Tremendous EMP output.

479
00:33:14,559 --> 00:33:15,992
Trying to reroute.

480
00:33:16,194 --> 00:33:18,321
They drew us in deliberately.

481
00:33:18,396 --> 00:33:21,388
Wanted us in range of their scanners,
so they could shut us down.

482
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:25,266
You said you wanted to get as much
information on their ships as possible.

483
00:33:25,336 --> 00:33:29,102
What if they want to capture our ships
for the exact same reason?

484
00:33:29,173 --> 00:33:32,267
Then we want to make sure
that does not happen, Commander.

485
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:33,935
Go to red alert.

486
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,539
Try to open up a channel.
Tell them we mean no harm.

487
00:33:41,352 --> 00:33:42,376
What is it?

488
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:45,422
We detected these alien ships
approaching our space.

489
00:33:45,490 --> 00:33:47,890
I've never seen those markings before.
Who are they?

490
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,324
I believe they are the Humans.

491
00:33:49,394 --> 00:33:52,659
They've tried to contact us,
but we do not understand their language.

492
00:33:52,730 --> 00:33:55,255
As is our custom,
we're approaching with gun ports open.

493
00:33:55,333 --> 00:33:56,391
By whose order?

494
00:33:57,168 --> 00:33:59,796
Sir! Alien ships have opened gun ports.

495
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:02,396
- Are they prepared to fire?
- I don't know. I can't tell.

496
00:34:02,473 --> 00:34:04,031
Talk to me. Are they locked on us?

497
00:34:04,108 --> 00:34:06,099
Scanners are too powerful.

498
00:34:06,177 --> 00:34:08,304
I couldn't tell even if they were.

499
00:34:09,013 --> 00:34:11,379
They have opened all gun ports.

500
00:34:12,116 --> 00:34:14,846
Master, that is the tradition
of the Warrior Caste...

501
00:34:14,919 --> 00:34:16,819
a gesture of strength and respect.

502
00:34:16,888 --> 00:34:19,550
They see our weapons,
and we approach them open-handed.

503
00:34:20,024 --> 00:34:23,824
Enemy presumed to be hostile.
Weapons hot!

504
00:34:25,196 --> 00:34:27,528
All batteries, all forward guns...

505
00:34:27,598 --> 00:34:29,589
fire at will. I repeat. Fire!

506
00:34:30,234 --> 00:34:31,292
Fire!

507
00:34:47,752 --> 00:34:50,721
Somebody, help me! Help me!

508
00:35:01,199 --> 00:35:03,997
We have hit their scanner arrays!
We can jump now.

509
00:35:04,068 --> 00:35:06,002
All right, get us the hell out of here!

510
00:35:14,178 --> 00:35:17,545
Delenn, we need to strike back,
but the Council is divided.

511
00:35:17,715 --> 00:35:20,240
Do we follow them back to their base
and take revenge...

512
00:35:20,318 --> 00:35:22,878
or do we wait,
try to find out what happened?

513
00:35:23,521 --> 00:35:25,887
Yours is the deciding vote, Delenn.

514
00:35:25,957 --> 00:35:27,891
He was the best of us.

515
00:35:28,759 --> 00:35:32,126
They struck without provocation.
There was no reason.

516
00:35:32,597 --> 00:35:35,464
Animals! Brutal!

517
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:40,267
They deserve no mercy!
Strike them down!

518
00:35:40,338 --> 00:35:43,068
Follow them to their base and kill them!

519
00:35:43,141 --> 00:35:46,042
All of them! All of them!

520
00:35:47,211 --> 00:35:48,906
No mercy!

521
00:35:51,315 --> 00:35:55,411
With the death of their leader, Dukhat,
the Minbari went mad.

522
00:35:55,486 --> 00:35:58,455
They swore revenge
and began a holy war...

523
00:35:58,523 --> 00:36:02,857
that could only end
in the complete extermination of mankind.

524
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:26,407
The incident you have just seen
has been repeated at half a dozen bases...

525
00:36:26,484 --> 00:36:28,213
in just the last few days.

526
00:36:28,419 --> 00:36:31,547
Where the Minbari strike,
nothing is left alive.

527
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:36,620
Even ships no longer capable of fighting
are targeted and destroyed.

528
00:36:36,861 --> 00:36:39,489
So, surrender on any scale
is not an option.

529
00:36:39,564 --> 00:36:41,964
Every attempt we've made
to communicate with them...

530
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,625
has been rebuffed.

531
00:36:43,701 --> 00:36:46,829
They are moving methodically
through the outer colonies...

532
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:50,305
wiping out our defense structures
and leaving the colonies vulnerable.

533
00:36:50,374 --> 00:36:52,968
Civilian structures are being left alone
for now.

534
00:36:53,044 --> 00:36:55,911
Now we know the Minbari
use a caste system...

535
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:58,240
including a warrior caste.

536
00:36:58,316 --> 00:37:02,218
And we think they're fighting
in a way consistent with that structure...

537
00:37:02,286 --> 00:37:05,778
taking out our warriors first,
and coming back for the rest later.

538
00:37:05,856 --> 00:37:09,656
They intend to eliminate our defensive
capability all the way to Earth.

539
00:37:09,727 --> 00:37:13,629
Then, with no one to stop them,
they'll head back out again...

540
00:37:13,698 --> 00:37:15,928
and finish the job of wiping out
every last man...

541
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:18,025
woman and child of the Human race.

542
00:37:18,102 --> 00:37:21,697
Since the first engagement, we have not
won a single battle from the enemy.

543
00:37:21,772 --> 00:37:24,605
Their ships are immensely superior
to our own.

544
00:37:24,675 --> 00:37:28,611
And they use stealth technology
we have not been able to beat yet.

545
00:37:28,679 --> 00:37:32,843
We called you here because we wanted
you to see the situation for yourselves.

546
00:37:33,451 --> 00:37:37,854
We want you to go back to your units
and make them understand two things:

547
00:37:38,022 --> 00:37:42,049
One, we need a victory
against these forces, any victory...

548
00:37:42,126 --> 00:37:43,855
to increase morale.

549
00:37:43,961 --> 00:37:48,159
Two, that unless we find a way
to defeat the Minbari...

550
00:37:49,000 --> 00:37:52,163
the Human race ends
with the current generation.

551
00:37:54,405 --> 00:37:55,633
Dismissed.

552
00:38:02,313 --> 00:38:05,180
There's got to be a way to beat them,
John.

553
00:38:05,249 --> 00:38:06,978
But you saw those records.

554
00:38:08,085 --> 00:38:10,645
Any ship that comes up
against them loses.

555
00:38:11,255 --> 00:38:15,089
I've never believed in the idea
of an undefeatable enemy, sir.

556
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:17,785
Any ship can be destroyed.

557
00:38:18,629 --> 00:38:20,460
I hope to hell you're right.

558
00:38:21,499 --> 00:38:24,627
It'll be a few more days
before the Lexington is fully outfitted...

559
00:38:24,702 --> 00:38:27,364
the engines recharged.
You can see your folks.

560
00:38:27,438 --> 00:38:29,702
But you're going to need me here, sir.

561
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:32,705
- They'll understand.
- Are you sure?

562
00:38:32,777 --> 00:38:35,541
If you were in my position, would you go?

563
00:38:36,814 --> 00:38:39,146
Under normal circumstances, no.

564
00:38:40,451 --> 00:38:42,385
But after what I saw...

565
00:38:43,321 --> 00:38:45,846
I'd go.

566
00:39:04,241 --> 00:39:06,004
Attention. Attention on deck.

567
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:09,569
Ganya lvanov,
you've got a visitor in Room 7.

568
00:39:09,647 --> 00:39:13,139
You've got five minutes.
Get to it. We've got to launch.

569
00:39:19,223 --> 00:39:22,090
Susan, what are you doing here?

570
00:39:22,226 --> 00:39:24,285
You're supposed to be at the university.

571
00:39:24,362 --> 00:39:26,626
You know me,
never where I'm supposed to be.

572
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:29,222
I just wanted to see you before you left.

573
00:39:29,333 --> 00:39:32,825
I thought big brothers were supposed
to take care of their little sisters.

574
00:39:32,903 --> 00:39:34,461
Not the other way around.

575
00:39:34,538 --> 00:39:35,664
So, sue me.

576
00:39:35,806 --> 00:39:38,570
I will. Later. When I get back.

577
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,940
I was just worried, that's all.

578
00:39:42,012 --> 00:39:45,038
I've heard many terrible stories
about what's going on out there.

579
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:47,209
It's not as bad as everyone says.

580
00:39:47,518 --> 00:39:50,316
I'll be fine.
The military takes care of its own.

581
00:39:50,554 --> 00:39:53,853
Then you'll back me up when I decide
to sign up in a few months.

582
00:39:53,924 --> 00:39:57,257
- Susan Ivanov, you can't...
- I'll be old enough by then.

583
00:39:57,695 --> 00:39:58,957
Father won't stand for it.

584
00:39:59,029 --> 00:40:00,360
It's my choice, not his.

585
00:40:00,431 --> 00:40:03,696
Ivanov Ganya,
report to Bay 9 for immediate launch.

586
00:40:08,906 --> 00:40:10,134
I have to go.

587
00:40:15,946 --> 00:40:17,675
I love you, little sister.

588
00:40:19,049 --> 00:40:20,607
I love you, too.

589
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:23,914
Ganya, wait.

590
00:40:24,722 --> 00:40:27,282
Remember when we were camping
and we got lost?

591
00:40:27,358 --> 00:40:29,918
And then I lost my earring,
and then we were found.

592
00:40:29,994 --> 00:40:32,462
I never found the earring.
You made me feel better...

593
00:40:32,530 --> 00:40:34,521
by telling me that it was lucky?

594
00:40:34,832 --> 00:40:36,231
I remember, but...

595
00:40:36,300 --> 00:40:38,962
Here, take this for good luck.

596
00:40:40,704 --> 00:40:43,502
I won't wear it again until you come back.

597
00:40:44,442 --> 00:40:46,535
Until you give it back to me.

598
00:40:47,144 --> 00:40:49,635
That way, we know you'll come back.

599
00:40:58,189 --> 00:40:59,713
See you soon.

600
00:41:11,101 --> 00:41:13,126
I'm sorry, but there's nothing I can do.

601
00:41:13,871 --> 00:41:17,739
We're not asking the Centauri government
to intervene militarily.

602
00:41:17,808 --> 00:41:19,571
We know that won't happen.

603
00:41:19,643 --> 00:41:22,407
We're talking tactical
and strategic support.

604
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,414
Yes, and weapons.

605
00:41:26,016 --> 00:41:29,008
You and the Minbari are two
of the older races.

606
00:41:29,086 --> 00:41:31,611
Your technology is far above our own.

607
00:41:31,689 --> 00:41:35,250
With access to some of your weapons,
we'd at least stand a fighting chance.

608
00:41:35,326 --> 00:41:39,228
It is not our policy to supply
advanced weapons to developing worlds.

609
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:42,357
- We'll pay any price.
- Yes.

610
00:41:42,433 --> 00:41:44,128
And then we will pay the price...

611
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:47,034
when the Minbari come after us
for helping you.

612
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:50,437
No, I'm sorry. There's not enough money
in your entire planet...

613
00:41:50,508 --> 00:41:52,100
to justify that risk.

614
00:41:52,176 --> 00:41:54,974
- Londo, if you'd just listen...
- To what?

615
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:58,613
The voice of a race
that is about to become extinct?

616
00:41:58,749 --> 00:42:00,239
No, I'm sorry.

617
00:42:00,784 --> 00:42:05,744
I have always been very fond of Humans,
but we cannot risk angering the Minbari.

618
00:42:06,924 --> 00:42:09,688
There is nothing I can do. I'm sorry.

619
00:42:18,602 --> 00:42:21,366
He refused to help,
just as you said he would.

620
00:42:21,438 --> 00:42:24,430
The Centauri care for no one
but themselves.

621
00:42:25,175 --> 00:42:29,635
They would sooner see your world
in flames than lift a finger to help.

622
00:42:30,281 --> 00:42:31,942
So it would seem.

623
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:36,616
All right, G'Kar,
what help can we expect from the Narns?

624
00:42:37,021 --> 00:42:41,151
When we drove the Centauri from
our world after 100 years of occupation...

625
00:42:41,225 --> 00:42:43,284
we seized many of their weapons.

626
00:42:43,360 --> 00:42:46,659
We took them apart, studied them,
learned to turn their own weapons...

627
00:42:46,730 --> 00:42:49,961
against them,
and we are willing to sell them to you.

628
00:42:50,034 --> 00:42:52,298
Aren't you worried about the Minbari?

629
00:42:52,870 --> 00:42:56,806
If they capture any of the equipment, they
will assume it came from the Centauri...

630
00:42:56,874 --> 00:42:59,069
attack them, and we win by default.

631
00:42:59,143 --> 00:43:02,544
And if they should learn that the weapons
came from us...

632
00:43:02,613 --> 00:43:04,513
we endured slavery for 100 years.

633
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:06,641
A slave is immune to the fear of dying...

634
00:43:06,717 --> 00:43:10,517
because to die is simply
to end the cycle of pain.

635
00:43:11,855 --> 00:43:13,584
How much can you sell us?

636
00:43:13,791 --> 00:43:16,692
As much as you can afford.
But the price will be high.

637
00:43:16,760 --> 00:43:20,059
Human currency has been devalued
on the interstellar market...

638
00:43:20,130 --> 00:43:23,497
so it will take a great deal
to convince the Kha'Ri to sell you arms...

639
00:43:23,567 --> 00:43:26,627
and provide support,
but I believe it can be done.

640
00:43:26,704 --> 00:43:28,672
Assuming we have a deal.

641
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:31,306
We have a deal, G'Kar.

642
00:43:57,835 --> 00:43:59,359
Good evening, Delenn.

643
00:44:00,537 --> 00:44:02,630
The latest reports from the front.

644
00:44:02,706 --> 00:44:06,164
Three more of the Humans'
deep range colonies have fallen.

645
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:08,769
Leave it on the table.

646
00:44:09,113 --> 00:44:12,810
I should think you would be more pleased
by the progress of the war.

647
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:15,852
What pleasure can be found
in beating an enemy...

648
00:44:15,919 --> 00:44:18,649
that never had the slightest chance
of defeating us?

649
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:21,350
Is that sympathy I hear in your voice,
Delenn?

650
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:23,822
I'm surprised.

651
00:44:24,061 --> 00:44:26,529
You were the chosen of Dukhat, after all.

652
00:44:26,764 --> 00:44:29,426
Dukhat would have never approved of
this slaughter!

653
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:31,491
This is simple retribution.

654
00:44:31,568 --> 00:44:34,002
This has gone beyond retribution, Morann.

655
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:36,505
This is madness. It is genocide.

656
00:44:36,573 --> 00:44:37,972
Yes, it is.

657
00:44:40,511 --> 00:44:42,536
And you're quite right, Delenn.

658
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:44,808
The Humans cannot oppose us.

659
00:44:45,282 --> 00:44:48,445
So, one can only wonder why
the Warrior Caste...

660
00:44:48,519 --> 00:44:51,420
has embraced this war so enthusiastically.

661
00:44:53,524 --> 00:44:55,287
Do you want to hear what I suspect?

662
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:57,759
I'm breathless with anticipation.

663
00:44:58,595 --> 00:45:01,496
The Warrior Caste loves to win...

664
00:45:01,765 --> 00:45:03,790
and hates to lose.

665
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:08,668
It is easier to fight a weaker opponent
and be guaranteed victory...

666
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:11,833
than to oppose
a far more dangerous enemy.

667
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:14,807
Are we back on the Shadows again?

668
00:45:14,878 --> 00:45:16,175
They will come.

669
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:17,805
And soon.

670
00:45:17,881 --> 00:45:19,405
Legends.

671
00:45:19,483 --> 00:45:20,711
Nothing more.

672
00:45:21,251 --> 00:45:23,549
The Humans are a real enemy...

673
00:45:23,620 --> 00:45:26,350
an enemy I can touch, see, and kill.

674
00:45:27,958 --> 00:45:30,688
Sometimes I wonder
where your loyalty really is.

675
00:45:31,361 --> 00:45:32,760
You dare?

676
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:34,695
Or is it simpler just to be a coward?

677
00:45:34,765 --> 00:45:35,754
Morann, get out.

678
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,824
- I was simply...
- I said "get out"!

679
00:45:41,672 --> 00:45:43,367
I'm sorry, Delenn.

680
00:45:44,141 --> 00:45:46,336
I was your guest and I acted poorly.

681
00:45:47,077 --> 00:45:48,908
No apologies are required.

682
00:45:50,514 --> 00:45:53,950
When you arrived,
you said you had information for me.

683
00:45:54,551 --> 00:45:58,954
I made arrangements to transfer
all of Dukhat's belongings to this ship.

684
00:45:59,623 --> 00:46:02,456
I brought everything that was his, Delenn.

685
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:04,856
I even recreated his sanctum.

686
00:46:05,696 --> 00:46:08,187
Only you and I have access for now.

687
00:46:09,666 --> 00:46:12,157
I think you should go there, Delenn.

688
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:15,235
I think you should go very soon.

689
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:51,367
Are you a Vorlon?

690
00:46:53,277 --> 00:46:54,437
Yes.

691
00:46:55,879 --> 00:46:56,903
Yes.

692
00:47:00,417 --> 00:47:01,679
What...

693
00:47:03,020 --> 00:47:04,419
What is your name?

694
00:47:05,289 --> 00:47:06,483
Kosh.

695
00:47:15,966 --> 00:47:17,365
What do you want?

696
00:47:19,069 --> 00:47:20,764
What are you doing here?

697
00:47:20,838 --> 00:47:22,738
Creating the future.

698
00:47:27,511 --> 00:47:31,038
If you are seeing this message,
it is because I am dead.

699
00:47:31,582 --> 00:47:33,345
I leave this in trust of the Vorlons...

700
00:47:33,417 --> 00:47:36,250
to give it to the right person,
at the right time.

701
00:47:36,687 --> 00:47:39,019
I ask you to trust them as I have.

702
00:47:39,823 --> 00:47:43,452
They have come to us in secret,
to prepare for the coming war.

703
00:47:43,660 --> 00:47:44,991
They say...

704
00:47:45,629 --> 00:47:47,392
we'll need allies...

705
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:51,264
in particular, a race that is so far
unknown to us called Humans.

706
00:47:53,370 --> 00:47:56,134
If we have not already done so by now...

707
00:47:56,440 --> 00:47:58,670
I hope that you will work
with the Vorlons...

708
00:47:58,742 --> 00:48:02,644
to find these Humans and bring them
into the battle on our side.

709
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:07,948
The allies of the Shadows
are gathering at Z'ha'dum.

710
00:48:08,652 --> 00:48:11,177
Their masters cannot be far behind.

711
00:48:11,655 --> 00:48:13,486
They must be stopped.

712
00:48:16,159 --> 00:48:18,150
Finish the work I began.

713
00:48:20,664 --> 00:48:21,756
Finish it.

714
00:48:27,170 --> 00:48:28,535
The Humans?

715
00:48:29,539 --> 00:48:32,235
Yes. They are the key.

716
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:33,867
He didn't know.

717
00:48:34,278 --> 00:48:37,338
He couldn't know that we are
at war with them.

718
00:48:37,814 --> 00:48:40,374
And that is why it must be stopped.

719
00:48:42,619 --> 00:48:46,248
We have lost too much valuable time
already due to this...

720
00:48:46,323 --> 00:48:47,517
distraction.

721
00:48:48,425 --> 00:48:51,861
If we do not end it soon,
more time will be lost.

722
00:48:52,162 --> 00:48:56,326
This great war must be stopped
before it starts...

723
00:48:56,833 --> 00:48:59,063
or millions of lives will be lost.

724
00:49:13,283 --> 00:49:17,743
The worst cases of radiation poisoning
will be brought here for treatment.

725
00:49:18,021 --> 00:49:21,787
When this goes on-line, it will be
the best facility of its kind anywhere.

726
00:49:21,858 --> 00:49:23,985
We still don't know
what kind of enhanced...

727
00:49:24,061 --> 00:49:26,552
energy weapons the Minbari use.
But when we do...

728
00:49:26,630 --> 00:49:29,121
What the hell is wrong with you, Franklin?

729
00:49:29,199 --> 00:49:31,190
Get out. This is private.

730
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:37,999
I just got this report about your activities
before you rejoined Earthforce.

731
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:41,272
You spent three years hitchhiking
on starships, trading services...

732
00:49:41,345 --> 00:49:43,108
as ship's doctor for free passage.

733
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:46,775
- That's right.
- You encountered a group of Minbari.

734
00:49:47,184 --> 00:49:50,585
One of their ships went down.
There was no one else around.

735
00:49:50,654 --> 00:49:52,144
I did what I could do to save them.

736
00:49:52,222 --> 00:49:54,690
We didn't know what we were up against.
They all died.

737
00:49:54,758 --> 00:49:56,487
- It's in the report.
- The hell it is!

738
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,723
I see statements about their language,
physiology, culture.

739
00:49:59,796 --> 00:50:00,854
I know you, Franklin.

740
00:50:00,931 --> 00:50:04,059
You weren't out there sightseeing.
You were gathering medical data.

741
00:50:04,134 --> 00:50:05,431
- Was there an autopsy?
- Yes.

742
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:09,233
Did you, or did you not, collect
detailed information about their DNA...

743
00:50:09,306 --> 00:50:14,243
their biology, that has vital importance
to the biogenetic warfare division?

744
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:17,340
- Yes, I did.
- And where are those notes?

745
00:50:17,514 --> 00:50:20,779
Sir, I am a doctor. My job is to save lives.

746
00:50:20,951 --> 00:50:24,182
- In my opinion...
- I don't give a rat's ass about your opinion!

747
00:50:24,254 --> 00:50:26,085
- I want those notes!
- I can't do that.

748
00:50:26,156 --> 00:50:28,147
Excuse me? I don't think I heard that.

749
00:50:28,225 --> 00:50:31,388
I can't allow my notes to be used
to create a biogenetic plague...

750
00:50:31,461 --> 00:50:33,326
that could wipe out an entire race.

751
00:50:33,397 --> 00:50:36,833
That's what they're doing to us.
Have you not been following the news?

752
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:39,494
If we do the same,
how are we any different?

753
00:50:39,569 --> 00:50:42,936
- Damn it, mister...
- I'm sorry, General. I am a doctor.

754
00:50:43,140 --> 00:50:46,473
I cannot allow my notes to be used
in the production of weapons of war.

755
00:50:46,543 --> 00:50:48,135
Under the military code of justice...

756
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,508
Don't talk to me about codes!

757
00:50:49,579 --> 00:50:52,514
You cannot force me
to go against my conscience!

758
00:50:52,749 --> 00:50:53,977
Security!

759
00:50:55,485 --> 00:50:57,646
Dr. Franklin's under arrest.

760
00:50:58,622 --> 00:51:01,819
He will be held until he produces
the information I have requested.

761
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:04,884
I want his office and house searched,
every data crystal.

762
00:51:04,961 --> 00:51:07,930
I want all reports and records confiscated
by 16:00.

763
00:51:08,298 --> 00:51:09,890
And God help you, son.

764
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:15,069
From now on, the blood of every soldier
that dies in this war is on your hands.

765
00:51:16,006 --> 00:51:17,769
Get him out of here!

766
00:51:23,880 --> 00:51:26,713
Commander's personal log, update.

767
00:51:27,684 --> 00:51:30,949
We lost two more ships to hit-and-run
attacks today.

768
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:35,150
My guess is they're softening us up
for a major offensive.

769
00:51:35,459 --> 00:51:38,428
Captain Sterns hasn't slept in two days.

770
00:51:39,029 --> 00:51:40,690
Word is there's some kind of...

771
00:51:40,764 --> 00:51:43,232
ace cruiser out there
that's killed two dozen...

772
00:51:43,300 --> 00:51:45,700
of our ships in the last three weeks.

773
00:51:45,936 --> 00:51:48,962
No one's survived an attack yet
to confirm that.

774
00:51:50,974 --> 00:51:53,340
Picking up Minbari-style transmissions.

775
00:51:54,644 --> 00:51:56,236
Target bearing mark:

776
00:51:56,580 --> 00:51:59,947
"9-9-7-2-1."

777
00:52:00,784 --> 00:52:03,275
- Should be in visual range.
- Let me see.

778
00:52:11,695 --> 00:52:13,424
Silhouette confirmed.

779
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:15,988
Looks like a short-range transport.

780
00:52:16,766 --> 00:52:19,132
All batteries, go to ready status.

781
00:52:19,202 --> 00:52:21,568
Roger that, batteries are ready.

782
00:52:23,273 --> 00:52:25,070
Could be a scout or...

783
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:28,441
a straggler that got separated
from a larger fleet.

784
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:31,872
Could be a decoy drawing us
into an ambush.

785
00:52:31,948 --> 00:52:33,779
- Should we pursue?
- Negative.

786
00:52:34,151 --> 00:52:36,483
I won't risk the fleet.

787
00:52:36,720 --> 00:52:41,157
She'll be leaving visual range any moment,
and the scanners can't lock on.

788
00:52:41,591 --> 00:52:43,855
- Launch bay, this is the Captain.
- Launch bay, aye.

789
00:52:43,927 --> 00:52:45,417
Launch solo fighter.

790
00:52:45,629 --> 00:52:47,324
I want that transport followed.

791
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:51,334
She's got a big head start on you, Eagle 7.

792
00:52:51,968 --> 00:52:53,993
Roger that. Maximum thrust.

793
00:53:06,583 --> 00:53:08,608
Eagle 7 to Lexington...

794
00:53:09,486 --> 00:53:11,113
she's flamed out.

795
00:53:11,188 --> 00:53:12,883
Stand by, Eagle 7.

796
00:53:15,058 --> 00:53:16,184
Move us in.

797
00:53:22,766 --> 00:53:24,256
Any further radio chatter?

798
00:53:24,334 --> 00:53:26,302
Negative. She's running silent.

799
00:53:29,105 --> 00:53:30,402
Keep moving us in.

800
00:53:30,473 --> 00:53:31,963
Sir, I don't like it.

801
00:53:32,042 --> 00:53:35,375
Just before the transport flamed out,
it fired its forward thrusters...

802
00:53:35,445 --> 00:53:37,936
cutting acceleration down
to almost nothing.

803
00:53:38,014 --> 00:53:40,812
Now, if I were running from the enemy,
engines failing...

804
00:53:40,884 --> 00:53:44,251
I'd try to keep my inertia going
on the off-chance I'd get away.

805
00:53:44,321 --> 00:53:46,846
Not just lying there waiting to get caught.

806
00:53:47,090 --> 00:53:49,388
Or maybe he wants to be captured alive...

807
00:53:49,459 --> 00:53:52,758
rather than risking getting killed
in that asteroid field.

808
00:53:52,829 --> 00:53:56,560
Or maybe they want us in a precise,
predetermined location.

809
00:53:56,666 --> 00:53:59,294
Captain, their jump engines
are more precise than ours.

810
00:53:59,369 --> 00:54:01,929
They can target an area
of less than 100 yards.

811
00:54:02,005 --> 00:54:03,939
- Lf they jump into the middle...
- Holy...

812
00:54:04,007 --> 00:54:06,475
This is fleet command. All ships, break off.

813
00:54:22,425 --> 00:54:23,414
No!

814
00:54:34,904 --> 00:54:36,667
Primary systems hit.

815
00:54:37,540 --> 00:54:42,068
Weapons and jump engines are down.
Only navigational thrusters functioning.

816
00:54:42,245 --> 00:54:43,473
Orders?

817
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:46,475
Captain? Order...

818
00:54:59,095 --> 00:55:01,859
The situation is getting out of control,
Lenonn.

819
00:55:03,099 --> 00:55:05,863
So far, we have hit only the outer colonies.

820
00:55:05,935 --> 00:55:08,802
They're sparsely populated
with minimal defenses.

821
00:55:08,872 --> 00:55:13,741
Soon we will hit colonies and stations
closer to the homeworld of the Humans.

822
00:55:14,944 --> 00:55:17,674
Every day that passes sees more death...

823
00:55:18,648 --> 00:55:22,311
and every death will make it
that much harder to intervene.

824
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:23,775
Then...

825
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:26,017
what do you suggest?

826
00:55:26,823 --> 00:55:29,485
We have to find a way
to open negotiations...

827
00:55:29,926 --> 00:55:32,326
give us time to find a solution.

828
00:55:33,029 --> 00:55:34,963
That's why I need you, Lenonn.

829
00:55:35,932 --> 00:55:38,457
I cannot contact the Humans directly...

830
00:55:38,535 --> 00:55:41,333
or ask any other member
of the Grey Council to do so.

831
00:55:41,404 --> 00:55:42,894
We cannot act alone.

832
00:55:43,807 --> 00:55:45,069
But someone else...

833
00:55:45,141 --> 00:55:47,701
might be able to contact them unofficially.

834
00:55:48,411 --> 00:55:50,936
Someone the others would respect...

835
00:55:51,614 --> 00:55:54,913
with a history of service
and unchallenged loyalty.

836
00:55:55,385 --> 00:55:57,114
Someone like you, Lenonn.

837
00:55:57,754 --> 00:56:00,814
I appreciate the compliment, Delenn, but...

838
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:03,219
how do I do this?

839
00:56:04,094 --> 00:56:07,063
If I attempt to contact them directly...

840
00:56:07,397 --> 00:56:10,389
the Grey Council will hear of it
and interfere.

841
00:56:10,734 --> 00:56:14,431
And the Humans
will almost certainly consider it a trap.

842
00:56:15,138 --> 00:56:17,072
Our intelligence reports indicate...

843
00:56:17,140 --> 00:56:20,541
the Humans have made a deal
with the Narns to buy weapons.

844
00:56:20,610 --> 00:56:24,569
Through the Narns, we can arrange
a meeting in neutral territory.

845
00:56:25,648 --> 00:56:27,309
But the danger is great.

846
00:56:27,650 --> 00:56:29,345
To live is to risk.

847
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:34,950
I'll instruct my Rangers to make contact...

848
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:38,221
with the Narn government
and set things in motion.

849
00:56:39,496 --> 00:56:43,159
With luck, the meeting could take place
in three weeks.

850
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:45,095
Perhaps four.

851
00:56:45,168 --> 00:56:46,635
It will have to do.

852
00:56:47,103 --> 00:56:50,163
I've been gathering information
on their language and culture.

853
00:56:50,240 --> 00:56:54,040
I'll make a copy for you this afternoon.
It may prove helpful.

854
00:56:55,578 --> 00:56:57,045
Thank you, Lenonn.

855
00:56:57,113 --> 00:56:58,102
No.

856
00:56:58,815 --> 00:56:59,873
Thank you.

857
00:57:01,084 --> 00:57:02,608
At my age...

858
00:57:03,086 --> 00:57:07,420
I feared that I would never again
have the chance to serve my people...

859
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:10,089
as one of my order should.

860
00:57:10,860 --> 00:57:12,191
Thank you...

861
00:57:12,662 --> 00:57:14,687
for giving me the opportunity.

862
00:57:15,698 --> 00:57:17,029
I will meet...

863
00:57:17,567 --> 00:57:19,865
whatever comes with joy.

864
00:57:26,342 --> 00:57:28,742
Bridge to engine room.
Do we have any power yet?

865
00:57:28,812 --> 00:57:30,302
Negative, sir.

866
00:57:30,380 --> 00:57:31,904
- Communications.
- Sir.

867
00:57:31,981 --> 00:57:34,779
Can we contact Earth,
send a distress signal?

868
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:36,341
It's possible.

869
00:57:36,419 --> 00:57:37,886
But, sir...

870
00:57:37,954 --> 00:57:41,185
that Minbari cruiser only left
because it figured we were dead.

871
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:43,191
If we send a distress signal...

872
00:57:43,259 --> 00:57:44,817
it'll come back and finish us off.

873
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:47,692
If we sit here and do nothing,
we're just as dead.

874
00:57:48,431 --> 00:57:50,023
Roger that, sir.

875
00:58:00,743 --> 00:58:02,176
Firing control...

876
00:58:02,245 --> 00:58:04,270
do we have any tactical nukes left?

877
00:58:04,714 --> 00:58:08,309
Affirmative. Three two-megaton warheads
with proximity fuses.

878
00:58:08,384 --> 00:58:11,319
All right.
I'm authorizing use of tactical nukes.

879
00:58:11,387 --> 00:58:13,150
Firing control, remove their warheads...

880
00:58:13,223 --> 00:58:15,589
get them down to Launching Bay 9, ASAP.

881
00:58:15,658 --> 00:58:19,856
Communications, stand by to broadcast
distress signal, but not till I give the order.

882
00:58:19,929 --> 00:58:20,987
Aye, sir.

883
00:58:23,766 --> 00:58:24,926
Now...

884
00:58:25,535 --> 00:58:27,025
I would be...

885
00:58:27,303 --> 00:58:31,672
less than honest if I said I was sure
this was going to work. It might.

886
00:58:31,875 --> 00:58:33,274
And it might not.

887
00:58:33,343 --> 00:58:36,710
We could very well blow up
right alongside the enemy.

888
00:58:37,680 --> 00:58:41,707
At least we'll have a fighting chance
of taking them out with us.

889
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:46,052
Unless anyone else has a better idea.

890
00:58:58,535 --> 00:58:59,866
Nuts.

891
00:59:01,070 --> 00:59:03,868
All right, then we'll stick with my plan.

892
00:59:04,974 --> 00:59:07,909
Hell, I didn't want to live forever anyway.

893
00:59:21,357 --> 00:59:23,917
Okay. We got the nukes in place.

894
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:25,961
- Heading back to the barn.
- Roger that.

895
00:59:31,267 --> 00:59:33,735
All right, send the distress signal.

896
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:39,134
Hope we don't have to wait too long.
I don't know how much more we can take.

897
00:59:40,043 --> 00:59:41,408
Commander...

898
00:59:41,477 --> 00:59:43,707
I think your wish may be coming true.

899
00:59:43,913 --> 00:59:47,110
We have an echo on vector approach,
might be them.

900
00:59:47,216 --> 00:59:48,979
Coming into range...

901
00:59:49,485 --> 00:59:50,474
now.

902
00:59:57,126 --> 00:59:58,923
Bridge to navigation.

903
00:59:59,028 --> 01:00:02,395
The enemy has a clear shot.
Fire docking thrusters.

904
01:00:02,465 --> 01:00:06,094
Get us behind one of those asteroids,
let them think we're trying to evade.

905
01:00:06,169 --> 01:00:08,501
If they want to finish the job,
let them come to us.

906
01:00:37,066 --> 01:00:38,465
Here we go.

907
01:00:39,636 --> 01:00:41,228
She's locking on, sir.

908
01:00:42,238 --> 01:00:43,728
A little more.

909
01:00:43,806 --> 01:00:45,273
Confirmed weapons lock.

910
01:00:45,341 --> 01:00:47,775
Energy spike! She's ready to fire!

911
01:00:50,880 --> 01:00:51,869
Now!

912
01:00:59,922 --> 01:01:02,857
She's out of range of nuke two.
Only one left.

913
01:01:02,925 --> 01:01:04,517
See you in hell.

914
01:01:23,246 --> 01:01:25,339
We plan on broadcasting this...

915
01:01:25,415 --> 01:01:28,748
to every major planetary network
for the next three days.

916
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:31,010
The Black Star was their flagship.

917
01:01:31,087 --> 01:01:34,250
We've shown that we can outthink it
and outfight it.

918
01:01:34,323 --> 01:01:36,291
And if any member
of the press corps asks...

919
01:01:36,359 --> 01:01:40,261
about the morality of sending out
a distress signal and hitting the enemy...

920
01:01:40,329 --> 01:01:43,389
remind them the Minbari
do not take survivors.

921
01:01:43,966 --> 01:01:48,335
They were on a mission to murder
the surviving crew of the Lexington.

922
01:01:48,404 --> 01:01:50,133
They paid the price.

923
01:01:51,708 --> 01:01:53,039
Dismissed.

924
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:02,680
That was quick thinking, Commander.

925
01:02:02,752 --> 01:02:05,050
- You're to be commended.
- Thank you, sir.

926
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:07,351
You were right to stay where you were.

927
01:02:07,423 --> 01:02:09,516
Thanks for arguing with me.

928
01:02:11,160 --> 01:02:13,185
Now, I have another job for you.

929
01:02:13,629 --> 01:02:17,463
- But my ship...
- It will take a while for it to be repaired.

930
01:02:18,234 --> 01:02:20,600
I need you for this immediately.

931
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:33,371
Commander Sheridan, this is G'Kar...

932
01:02:33,449 --> 01:02:37,681
of the Narn Regime which has agreed
to sell us weapons to equalize the battle.

933
01:02:38,054 --> 01:02:40,716
He's also here to make arrangements
for a covert mission.

934
01:02:40,790 --> 01:02:42,280
- Commander.
- Sir.

935
01:02:42,558 --> 01:02:45,686
A Narn cruiser will transport you
to an abandoned listening post...

936
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,286
in Sector 919...

937
01:02:47,764 --> 01:02:49,061
where, in theory...

938
01:02:49,132 --> 01:02:52,295
you will rendezvous
with a representative of the Minbari.

939
01:02:52,401 --> 01:02:53,390
Note:

940
01:02:53,636 --> 01:02:55,126
I said, "in theory."

941
01:02:55,371 --> 01:02:58,306
We've heard that elements
of their government want a meeting...

942
01:02:58,374 --> 01:03:01,605
to discuss a way of ending the war
without the annihilation of Earth.

943
01:03:01,677 --> 01:03:03,406
Most progressive of them.

944
01:03:03,546 --> 01:03:05,275
It could also be a trick.

945
01:03:05,915 --> 01:03:07,143
We want you to make contact...

946
01:03:07,216 --> 01:03:10,708
since you've shown you can handle
yourself against them if things get hot.

947
01:03:10,787 --> 01:03:13,187
Your record on first contact protocol
is outstanding.

948
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:14,723
And I'm expendable.

949
01:03:15,324 --> 01:03:19,192
Once we know it's safe and they're
serious, we'll send in the negotiators.

950
01:03:19,862 --> 01:03:21,762
Anyone else on my team?

951
01:03:22,198 --> 01:03:23,324
Just one.

952
01:03:28,604 --> 01:03:31,767
Commander Sheridan,
Dr. Stephen Franklin.

953
01:03:32,375 --> 01:03:36,038
He's had a fair amount of physical contact
with the Minbari before the war.

954
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:38,876
He can verify these individuals are
who they say they are...

955
01:03:38,948 --> 01:03:41,314
and be on hand in case things go badly.

956
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:44,918
You volunteered?

957
01:03:45,788 --> 01:03:48,279
Well, I didn't have that much of a choice.

958
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:51,151
The only way I could get out
of the stockade.

959
01:03:52,228 --> 01:03:54,059
Long story. Tell you later.

960
01:03:56,199 --> 01:03:57,791
What about a translator?

961
01:03:57,867 --> 01:04:00,734
We've heard that your contact
has studied your language.

962
01:04:00,803 --> 01:04:04,796
Just in case, I will go along,
since I am fluent in Minbari and English.

963
01:04:05,675 --> 01:04:08,974
I don't have to tell you how important
this mission is, Commander.

964
01:04:09,045 --> 01:04:10,672
It's been only a few months...

965
01:04:10,746 --> 01:04:13,579
but there are millions of lives at risk
in the inner colonies.

966
01:04:13,649 --> 01:04:15,549
More here in the home system.

967
01:04:16,219 --> 01:04:19,086
This has to go well, John.
There's no other choice.

968
01:04:19,956 --> 01:04:22,789
And if the only way out is for Earth
to surrender?

969
01:04:23,092 --> 01:04:25,219
Officially, that's up to the negotiators.

970
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:26,784
Those are my orders.

971
01:04:27,530 --> 01:04:28,827
Unofficially...

972
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:31,363
we're losing this war, John.

973
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:35,462
And if the only way the Human race
can survive is to surrender...

974
01:04:36,072 --> 01:04:37,699
then we will surrender.

975
01:04:38,474 --> 01:04:39,805
Orders.

976
01:04:40,376 --> 01:04:42,003
We all have our orders.

977
01:04:43,479 --> 01:04:45,970
That is something you
don't understand yet.

978
01:04:46,449 --> 01:04:48,974
You think to go to bed early is an order...

979
01:04:49,685 --> 01:04:51,812
to clean your room is an order.

980
01:04:52,588 --> 01:04:54,112
The hard orders...

981
01:04:54,657 --> 01:04:56,955
those are the ones you discover later.

982
01:04:57,760 --> 01:05:00,888
The order to leave your friends
on the battlefield.

983
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:03,090
The order to...

984
01:05:03,165 --> 01:05:05,827
fire upon the weak, the powerless.

985
01:05:07,603 --> 01:05:08,865
My orders...

986
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:15,369
My orders were to prevent the Narns
from using the war...

987
01:05:15,645 --> 01:05:18,113
to establish closer ties with the Humans.

988
01:05:19,148 --> 01:05:23,084
My spies learned of the Narn mission
to the Epsilon system.

989
01:05:23,152 --> 01:05:26,121
We assumed it was an arms shipment.

990
01:05:26,188 --> 01:05:27,849
We didn't know...

991
01:05:27,924 --> 01:05:32,258
we couldn't know
that it was an attempt to end the war.

992
01:05:35,031 --> 01:05:38,159
And so, I gave the order to intercept them.

993
01:05:39,001 --> 01:05:40,901
Great Maker, forgive me.

994
01:06:06,629 --> 01:06:09,189
Just a sec.
We need to find the power supply.

995
01:06:12,034 --> 01:06:14,935
I just hope the solar batteries
are still working.

996
01:06:22,912 --> 01:06:26,348
Dr. Franklin, check the perimeters.
See if we can secure this place.

997
01:06:26,415 --> 01:06:27,507
All right.

998
01:06:28,217 --> 01:06:29,912
You know, Commander...

999
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:33,245
if we are unable
to resolve this war of yours...

1000
01:06:33,322 --> 01:06:36,314
there is always a place for someone
like you among our people.

1001
01:06:36,392 --> 01:06:39,384
We could arrange a safe haven
for you and a few others.

1002
01:06:39,462 --> 01:06:40,451
Thanks...

1003
01:06:40,529 --> 01:06:42,827
but if my world goes, I'm going with it.

1004
01:06:42,898 --> 01:06:45,332
A waste of material. Most unfortunate.

1005
01:06:47,937 --> 01:06:51,236
Good, Doctor, I was just telling your...

1006
01:07:00,182 --> 01:07:01,410
Precaution...

1007
01:07:01,717 --> 01:07:02,843
only.

1008
01:07:04,320 --> 01:07:06,185
You, Sheridan?

1009
01:07:06,655 --> 01:07:07,747
Yes.

1010
01:07:08,891 --> 01:07:11,792
I didn't know you'd been told
who was coming.

1011
01:07:11,861 --> 01:07:13,988
We know more than you think.

1012
01:07:15,064 --> 01:07:17,965
I also know what you did to the...

1013
01:07:18,234 --> 01:07:19,326
Drali Fi.

1014
01:07:19,402 --> 01:07:20,960
The Black Star.

1015
01:07:21,203 --> 01:07:23,501
We did exactly
what you would have done to us.

1016
01:07:23,572 --> 01:07:25,005
We just did it first.

1017
01:07:25,074 --> 01:07:26,200
I know.

1018
01:07:26,876 --> 01:07:28,366
It was necessary.

1019
01:07:29,011 --> 01:07:31,980
I also know that many of my people...

1020
01:07:32,748 --> 01:07:34,682
will not forget.

1021
01:07:35,551 --> 01:07:37,542
I speak to you...

1022
01:07:37,987 --> 01:07:39,284
for them.

1023
01:07:39,789 --> 01:07:43,987
We must find a way to resolve this...

1024
01:07:44,060 --> 01:07:47,996
so that many more of your people
not get killed.

1025
01:07:49,732 --> 01:07:50,892
We...

1026
01:07:52,001 --> 01:07:53,025
Yes?

1027
01:07:53,102 --> 01:07:56,003
G'Kar, a ship is coming
through the jump gate!

1028
01:07:56,605 --> 01:07:58,129
Do you have a reading on it?

1029
01:08:03,245 --> 01:08:05,236
N'Fal? N'Fal, can you hear me?

1030
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:10,841
Hit the deck!

1031
01:08:19,295 --> 01:08:21,024
They never knew...

1032
01:08:21,363 --> 01:08:22,955
who had attacked them.

1033
01:08:23,099 --> 01:08:27,399
Each side assumed it was a renegade arm
of their own government.

1034
01:08:28,204 --> 01:08:29,694
But it was us.

1035
01:08:30,106 --> 01:08:33,041
And it was my order that destroyed...

1036
01:08:33,109 --> 01:08:35,043
their last chance for peace.

1037
01:08:52,027 --> 01:08:53,619
Help me.

1038
01:08:55,598 --> 01:08:57,088
How is he?

1039
01:08:57,466 --> 01:08:58,592
Not good.

1040
01:08:58,767 --> 01:09:00,667
We need him alive.

1041
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,071
That may not be...

1042
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:04,736
possible.

1043
01:09:05,875 --> 01:09:07,240
I am sorry...

1044
01:09:07,676 --> 01:09:09,576
I made things worse.

1045
01:09:09,979 --> 01:09:11,276
Try not to talk.

1046
01:09:11,347 --> 01:09:12,905
No, you must listen.

1047
01:09:14,483 --> 01:09:16,417
They will come looking for me.

1048
01:09:16,652 --> 01:09:18,449
And they will blame you...

1049
01:09:19,021 --> 01:09:20,249
for me.

1050
01:09:21,090 --> 01:09:22,421
And the war...

1051
01:09:23,559 --> 01:09:25,117
will grow worse.

1052
01:09:26,195 --> 01:09:27,321
Listen...

1053
01:09:27,429 --> 01:09:28,623
carefully.

1054
01:09:29,064 --> 01:09:31,123
And repeat exactly.

1055
01:09:43,579 --> 01:09:45,479
- Did you get it?
- Yeah.

1056
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,584
As Lenonn had promised...

1057
01:09:52,755 --> 01:09:55,155
the Minbari came quickly.

1058
01:10:28,357 --> 01:10:29,483
Wait.

1059
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:30,923
I have a message.

1060
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:32,852
I said, "I have a message!"

1061
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:35,658
I know what's in Dukhat's sacred place.

1062
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:39,163
I know what's in Dukhat's...

1063
01:10:40,803 --> 01:10:43,601
I know what's in Dukhat's sacred place!

1064
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:44,798
Stop!

1065
01:10:48,744 --> 01:10:51,770
What is in Dukhat's sacred place?

1066
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:02,690
Let them go.

1067
01:11:03,993 --> 01:11:06,791
- Satai...
- I said, "Let them go."

1068
01:11:07,363 --> 01:11:09,490
There has been enough death today.

1069
01:11:12,601 --> 01:11:13,863
Isil-zha.

1070
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:15,760
What does that mean?

1071
01:11:16,505 --> 01:11:17,597
The future.

1072
01:11:23,212 --> 01:11:24,975
Is that the end of the story?

1073
01:11:25,047 --> 01:11:26,309
The end?

1074
01:11:26,615 --> 01:11:27,639
No.

1075
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:30,211
No, not the end.

1076
01:11:30,953 --> 01:11:32,853
At the point that I am describing...

1077
01:11:32,921 --> 01:11:36,789
50,000, maybe 60,000 Humans had died
in the Minbari War.

1078
01:11:37,693 --> 01:11:41,595
With their one chance for peace ruined
and Lenonn dead...

1079
01:11:41,864 --> 01:11:43,525
the war escalated.

1080
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:45,990
The end of the story?

1081
01:11:47,202 --> 01:11:48,794
Break off! I'm hit!

1082
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:52,465
No.

1083
01:11:52,741 --> 01:11:54,368
Not the end at all.

1084
01:11:55,411 --> 01:11:57,276
The greatest slaughter of all...

1085
01:11:57,346 --> 01:11:58,813
still waits for us.

1086
01:11:59,415 --> 01:12:01,246
And it changed everything.

1087
01:12:02,584 --> 01:12:04,279
Everything.

1088
01:12:18,801 --> 01:12:20,393
It's ironic, isn't it?

1089
01:12:21,737 --> 01:12:25,366
I had every window in the palace
blocked off because I was afraid...

1090
01:12:25,441 --> 01:12:28,842
that if I came around a corner
and saw this, unprepared...

1091
01:12:29,945 --> 01:12:32,311
that I would break down and cry.

1092
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:37,312
And yet I spend all of my time here
in this room...

1093
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:40,311
Iooking at it.

1094
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:50,321
In my life, I had four wives.

1095
01:12:50,933 --> 01:12:52,764
I cared for them all deeply.

1096
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:56,330
But I loved Centauri Prime.

1097
01:12:58,073 --> 01:13:01,338
Loved every street, every tower...

1098
01:13:02,010 --> 01:13:03,773
every inch of our world.

1099
01:13:06,448 --> 01:13:08,473
Everything I did, I did for her.

1100
01:13:11,387 --> 01:13:13,514
And look what we have done to her.

1101
01:13:18,460 --> 01:13:19,757
There is hope.

1102
01:13:20,396 --> 01:13:22,330
But it will be hard.

1103
01:13:23,031 --> 01:13:25,329
It will be so very hard.

1104
01:13:33,609 --> 01:13:34,769
Where was I?

1105
01:13:36,612 --> 01:13:37,704
Yes.

1106
01:13:38,981 --> 01:13:40,380
The war.

1107
01:13:45,554 --> 01:13:48,352
The Humans, I think,
knew they were doomed.

1108
01:13:48,624 --> 01:13:51,525
But where another race
would surrender to despair...

1109
01:13:51,593 --> 01:13:54,426
the Humans fought back
with even greater strength.

1110
01:13:55,197 --> 01:13:57,358
They made the Minbari fight...

1111
01:13:57,433 --> 01:13:59,628
for every inch of space.

1112
01:14:00,068 --> 01:14:02,730
In my life,
I have never seen anything like it.

1113
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:08,106
They would weep...

1114
01:14:08,177 --> 01:14:11,305
they would pray, they would say
goodbye to their loved ones...

1115
01:14:11,380 --> 01:14:12,847
then throw themselves...

1116
01:14:12,915 --> 01:14:14,849
without fear or hesitation...

1117
01:14:14,917 --> 01:14:17,215
at the very face of death itself.

1118
01:14:17,853 --> 01:14:19,377
Never surrendering.

1119
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:30,857
No one who saw them fighting against...

1120
01:14:30,933 --> 01:14:33,527
the inevitable could help
but be moved to tears...

1121
01:14:33,602 --> 01:14:34,967
by their courage.

1122
01:14:36,238 --> 01:14:38,206
Their stubborn nobility.

1123
01:14:45,380 --> 01:14:47,871
When they ran out of ships,
they used guns.

1124
01:14:48,083 --> 01:14:50,517
When they ran out of guns
they used knives...

1125
01:14:50,586 --> 01:14:53,077
and sticks and bare hands.

1126
01:14:53,822 --> 01:14:55,722
They were magnificent.

1127
01:15:00,395 --> 01:15:01,919
I only hope...

1128
01:15:02,297 --> 01:15:04,026
that when it is my time...

1129
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:06,860
I may die with half as much dignity...

1130
01:15:07,035 --> 01:15:09,162
as I saw in their eyes at the end.

1131
01:15:10,105 --> 01:15:13,506
They did this for two years.

1132
01:15:13,742 --> 01:15:15,676
They never ran out of courage.

1133
01:15:16,345 --> 01:15:18,006
But in the end...

1134
01:15:18,313 --> 01:15:19,974
they ran out of time.

1135
01:15:26,989 --> 01:15:28,456
Are we on?

1136
01:15:30,759 --> 01:15:32,124
This is...

1137
01:15:32,761 --> 01:15:34,353
This is the President.

1138
01:15:35,631 --> 01:15:38,691
I've just been informed
that our midrange military bases...

1139
01:15:38,767 --> 01:15:40,792
at Beta Durani and Proxima 3...

1140
01:15:42,070 --> 01:15:44,300
have fallen to the Minbari advance.

1141
01:15:45,974 --> 01:15:47,737
We've lost contact with lo...

1142
01:15:47,809 --> 01:15:51,370
and must conclude that they too
have fallen to an advanced force.

1143
01:15:52,514 --> 01:15:54,573
Our military intelligence believes...

1144
01:15:54,650 --> 01:15:58,381
that the Minbari intend to bypass Mars
and hit Earth directly...

1145
01:15:58,921 --> 01:16:01,549
and the attack may come at any time.

1146
01:16:03,492 --> 01:16:06,518
We have continued to broadcast
our surrender...

1147
01:16:06,628 --> 01:16:08,152
and a plea for mercy.

1148
01:16:09,565 --> 01:16:11,533
And they have not responded.

1149
01:16:13,368 --> 01:16:15,563
We therefore can only conclude...

1150
01:16:16,905 --> 01:16:18,930
that we stand at the twilight...

1151
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:21,808
of the Human race.

1152
01:16:23,812 --> 01:16:25,677
In order to buy more time...

1153
01:16:25,781 --> 01:16:28,545
for our evacuation transports
to leave Earth...

1154
01:16:29,484 --> 01:16:32,510
we ask for the support of every ship...

1155
01:16:32,788 --> 01:16:34,517
capable of fighting...

1156
01:16:35,324 --> 01:16:38,589
to take part in a last defense
of our homeworld.

1157
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:41,889
We will not lie to you.

1158
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:46,226
We do not believe that survival
is a possibility.

1159
01:16:46,935 --> 01:16:49,631
We believe that anyone who joins
this battle...

1160
01:16:50,772 --> 01:16:52,569
will never come home.

1161
01:16:55,043 --> 01:16:57,568
But for every ten minutes...

1162
01:16:57,913 --> 01:17:00,541
we can delay the military advance...

1163
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:03,847
several hundred civilians...

1164
01:17:03,919 --> 01:17:06,717
may have a chance to escape
to neutral territory.

1165
01:17:08,056 --> 01:17:10,047
Though Earth may fall...

1166
01:17:10,826 --> 01:17:13,659
the Human race must have a chance...

1167
01:17:13,729 --> 01:17:15,321
to continue elsewhere.

1168
01:17:17,499 --> 01:17:19,899
No greater sacrifice has ever been asked...

1169
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:22,232
of a people that I ask you now...

1170
01:17:23,138 --> 01:17:25,698
to step forward one last time...

1171
01:17:26,908 --> 01:17:28,705
one last battle...

1172
01:17:28,977 --> 01:17:31,502
to hold the line against the night.

1173
01:17:32,848 --> 01:17:34,042
May God...

1174
01:17:34,216 --> 01:17:35,581
go with you all.

1175
01:17:59,241 --> 01:18:02,472
We are almost within range
of the homeworld of the Humans.

1176
01:18:03,378 --> 01:18:05,778
The Grey Council should be assembled...

1177
01:18:05,847 --> 01:18:08,077
to see the end of our great campaign.

1178
01:18:09,217 --> 01:18:13,017
What glory is there in eliminating
an entire race, Coplann?

1179
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:19,050
Not as much as in the beginning.

1180
01:18:21,063 --> 01:18:22,997
It's been a long road, Delenn.

1181
01:18:23,899 --> 01:18:26,197
But we are nearly at the end of our...

1182
01:18:27,135 --> 01:18:28,432
holy war.

1183
01:18:33,508 --> 01:18:35,669
But are we any longer holy?

1184
01:18:37,713 --> 01:18:40,705
Why is it, whenever I see you,
you never speak...

1185
01:18:41,283 --> 01:18:43,217
other than to ask questions?

1186
01:18:45,253 --> 01:18:47,721
Because questions are all I have left.

1187
01:18:48,724 --> 01:18:50,157
And after today...

1188
01:18:51,259 --> 01:18:53,659
I think they're all I will ever have.

1189
01:18:55,063 --> 01:18:57,896
Then at least bring your questions
to the Council.

1190
01:18:59,434 --> 01:19:01,459
We must all be there at the end.

1191
01:19:42,844 --> 01:19:44,311
Are you still here?

1192
01:19:45,547 --> 01:19:48,107
We have always been here.

1193
01:19:50,318 --> 01:19:51,751
I've failed.

1194
01:19:53,088 --> 01:19:54,487
In a little while...

1195
01:19:54,556 --> 01:19:56,717
the final slaughter will begin.

1196
01:19:58,593 --> 01:20:00,720
I know the others do not want it.

1197
01:20:01,096 --> 01:20:04,395
Even Morann is tired of war, tired of blood.

1198
01:20:05,033 --> 01:20:06,967
But the war has taken on...

1199
01:20:07,102 --> 01:20:08,729
a life of its own.

1200
01:20:08,804 --> 01:20:11,170
And it will continue to its bloody end...

1201
01:20:11,239 --> 01:20:12,866
no matter our feelings.

1202
01:20:14,910 --> 01:20:16,036
I think...

1203
01:20:17,379 --> 01:20:20,576
I think the others only need a reason
to delay.

1204
01:20:20,649 --> 01:20:21,911
Or reconsider.

1205
01:20:22,784 --> 01:20:24,809
But there is no such reason.

1206
01:20:25,587 --> 01:20:27,214
And we are out of time.

1207
01:20:31,626 --> 01:20:33,321
I don't know what to do.

1208
01:20:35,397 --> 01:20:36,864
Tell me...

1209
01:20:38,266 --> 01:20:39,790
Tell me what to do.

1210
01:20:57,786 --> 01:20:59,879
The truth points to itself.

1211
01:21:01,189 --> 01:21:02,315
What?

1212
01:21:03,225 --> 01:21:06,820
The truth points to itself.

1213
01:21:08,430 --> 01:21:10,227
I do not understand.

1214
01:21:10,298 --> 01:21:11,629
You will.

1215
01:21:12,133 --> 01:21:13,259
But...

1216
01:21:13,335 --> 01:21:15,860
- Go now.
- Go.

1217
01:21:16,238 --> 01:21:17,865
Before it's too late.

1218
01:21:32,287 --> 01:21:33,652
Alpha 7 to base.

1219
01:21:33,855 --> 01:21:36,847
I'm picking up energy emissions
on the horizon.

1220
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:40,622
Alpha 7, scout ahead,
see what's out there.

1221
01:21:40,695 --> 01:21:41,923
Affirmative.

1222
01:21:41,997 --> 01:21:43,521
Any bogeys on screen?

1223
01:21:43,598 --> 01:21:44,997
Negative, Alpha 7.

1224
01:21:45,233 --> 01:21:47,793
All other squadrons,
maintain radio silence...

1225
01:21:47,869 --> 01:21:49,302
until Alpha 7 checks this out.

1226
01:21:52,874 --> 01:21:54,899
Closing in on trace emissions.

1227
01:21:54,976 --> 01:21:56,603
So far, nothing.

1228
01:21:56,678 --> 01:21:58,669
It might be just an echo or...

1229
01:21:59,948 --> 01:22:01,142
Oh, hell.

1230
01:22:03,885 --> 01:22:07,252
We've got a scouting party.
Repeat. We've got a scouting party.

1231
01:22:07,322 --> 01:22:09,517
Hostiles on approach. Locking on.

1232
01:22:10,292 --> 01:22:11,782
Hold on. Hold on.

1233
01:22:12,294 --> 01:22:13,318
Alpha 7!

1234
01:22:14,329 --> 01:22:15,318
He's gone.

1235
01:22:15,430 --> 01:22:16,795
Picking up enemy transmissions.

1236
01:22:17,065 --> 01:22:18,532
Stay in formation!

1237
01:22:18,934 --> 01:22:21,402
Hold the line!
No one gets through no matter what!

1238
01:22:21,469 --> 01:22:22,868
Understood.

1239
01:22:23,171 --> 01:22:25,935
Alpha Leader,
you have a Minbari on your tail.

1240
01:22:31,179 --> 01:22:32,874
It is time.

1241
01:22:33,682 --> 01:22:35,377
Tell the others to jump.

1242
01:22:53,468 --> 01:22:54,560
I'm on him.

1243
01:22:54,636 --> 01:22:57,628
Targeting fighter, no!
Mitchell, stay in formation.

1244
01:22:57,706 --> 01:22:58,695
It might be a...

1245
01:22:58,807 --> 01:22:59,933
Oh, my God.

1246
01:23:03,511 --> 01:23:05,672
- They're everywhere.
- We can't stop them.

1247
01:23:05,747 --> 01:23:07,214
They're locking on!

1248
01:23:21,529 --> 01:23:22,928
It's a trap. Mitchell!

1249
01:23:22,998 --> 01:23:25,091
I've got a clear shot. I can take them.

1250
01:23:25,166 --> 01:23:26,861
Mitchell, break off, break off.

1251
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:44,341
They fight bravely.

1252
01:23:45,553 --> 01:23:47,453
They cannot harm our ships...

1253
01:23:47,789 --> 01:23:49,518
but they continue to try.

1254
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:51,056
Fighting or not...

1255
01:23:51,126 --> 01:23:53,651
they know they will die, so really...

1256
01:23:53,728 --> 01:23:55,161
is this bravery...

1257
01:23:55,830 --> 01:23:57,559
or simple desperation?

1258
01:24:02,270 --> 01:24:04,238
Aft stabilizers hit.
Weapons systems at zero.

1259
01:24:04,305 --> 01:24:06,967
Defensive grid at zero.
Power plant near critical mass.

1260
01:24:07,042 --> 01:24:08,634
Minbari targeting systems locking on.

1261
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:11,645
If I'm going out,
I'm taking you bastards with me!

1262
01:24:14,182 --> 01:24:18,141
Target main cruiser. Set for full velocity
ram. Afterburners on my mark!

1263
01:24:18,253 --> 01:24:19,413
Mark!

1264
01:24:22,190 --> 01:24:25,057
We should bring one of them aboard
for questioning.

1265
01:24:25,527 --> 01:24:28,587
If our next step is the final assault
on their world...

1266
01:24:29,030 --> 01:24:31,055
we must know their defenses.

1267
01:24:31,132 --> 01:24:33,362
Very well, Delenn. Choose.

1268
01:24:33,768 --> 01:24:35,065
But quickly.

1269
01:24:35,637 --> 01:24:37,628
We are fast running out of candidates.

1270
01:24:37,705 --> 01:24:39,730
The truth points to itself.

1271
01:24:39,808 --> 01:24:40,797
That one.

1272
01:25:05,834 --> 01:25:07,768
I'll see to the interrogation.

1273
01:25:20,615 --> 01:25:22,048
Why are you...

1274
01:25:22,784 --> 01:25:24,149
doing this?

1275
01:25:52,013 --> 01:25:53,605
Report me if you wish.

1276
01:25:53,781 --> 01:25:56,716
But I've seen more death
than anyone should ever have to see.

1277
01:25:56,784 --> 01:25:58,581
- I'll see no more.
- Delenn.

1278
01:25:58,653 --> 01:26:00,712
If you wish to finally destroy Earth...

1279
01:26:00,788 --> 01:26:02,813
- I will not watch, l...
- Delenn...

1280
01:26:04,993 --> 01:26:08,429
we were using the Triluminary...

1281
01:26:08,496 --> 01:26:09,963
to probe the Human.

1282
01:26:12,567 --> 01:26:14,262
You should come and see.

1283
01:26:15,370 --> 01:26:16,632
I'll get the others.

1284
01:26:16,704 --> 01:26:17,932
You should...

1285
01:26:18,806 --> 01:26:20,671
all come and see.

1286
01:26:53,942 --> 01:26:55,739
The Triluminary confirms it.

1287
01:26:56,077 --> 01:26:57,977
The Human has a Minbari soul.

1288
01:26:58,313 --> 01:27:00,247
And not just a Minbari soul...

1289
01:27:00,648 --> 01:27:02,206
the soul of Valen.

1290
01:27:03,351 --> 01:27:05,182
I still can't believe it.

1291
01:27:06,454 --> 01:27:09,184
But the Triluminary is our most holy relic.

1292
01:27:10,358 --> 01:27:12,053
It cannot be questioned.

1293
01:27:12,393 --> 01:27:15,089
Minbari do not kill Minbari.

1294
01:27:15,196 --> 01:27:16,857
It is our greatest law.

1295
01:27:18,233 --> 01:27:21,361
Valen must have been reborn
into this form...

1296
01:27:21,436 --> 01:27:23,597
to tell us that the Humans are important.

1297
01:27:23,671 --> 01:27:25,935
Important to the next phase...

1298
01:27:26,140 --> 01:27:27,732
the coming Shadow War.

1299
01:27:29,377 --> 01:27:31,004
We cannot destroy them.

1300
01:27:31,813 --> 01:27:33,440
In the name of Valen...

1301
01:27:33,681 --> 01:27:37,378
and the one who is Valen's shadow
in this life, we cannot kill them.

1302
01:27:39,721 --> 01:27:41,655
Tell the ships to stop firing.

1303
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:44,255
Tell them, Coplann.

1304
01:27:44,425 --> 01:27:46,222
Tell them now.

1305
01:27:50,665 --> 01:27:52,257
What about the Human?

1306
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,431
He knows what we have found.

1307
01:27:54,736 --> 01:27:56,203
We cannot kill him.

1308
01:27:56,838 --> 01:27:59,238
And we cannot let him tell anyone else.

1309
01:27:59,307 --> 01:28:01,332
If our people find out about this...

1310
01:28:01,409 --> 01:28:04,276
before we can prepare them,
it could be disastrous.

1311
01:28:04,612 --> 01:28:06,239
Send for a telepath.

1312
01:28:06,314 --> 01:28:08,714
We will remove this memory
from his mind.

1313
01:28:08,916 --> 01:28:12,249
He will have to be watched
to ensure that he does not remember.

1314
01:28:12,320 --> 01:28:13,685
Leave that to me.

1315
01:28:14,422 --> 01:28:17,255
We will keep him close to us
one way or another.

1316
01:28:21,596 --> 01:28:23,461
For the next 10 years...

1317
01:28:24,032 --> 01:28:27,195
one question would obsess 100 worlds:

1318
01:28:28,102 --> 01:28:31,299
Why did the Minbari surrender
at the Battle of the Line...

1319
01:28:31,673 --> 01:28:34,233
on the very eve of victory?

1320
01:28:36,044 --> 01:28:37,978
The answer to that question...

1321
01:28:38,646 --> 01:28:40,671
would change the galaxy forever.

1322
01:28:41,649 --> 01:28:43,776
What happened when they found out?

1323
01:28:44,285 --> 01:28:45,274
That...

1324
01:28:47,255 --> 01:28:48,688
is another story...

1325
01:28:49,390 --> 01:28:50,755
for another time.

1326
01:28:52,627 --> 01:28:55,653
You cannot expect to hear
all of the stories at once, you know.

1327
01:28:58,333 --> 01:29:00,824
But shortly after the war ended...

1328
01:29:01,636 --> 01:29:04,332
the Earth President made a decision.

1329
01:29:05,406 --> 01:29:09,934
The Senate has approved funding
to construct on the Babylon Station...

1330
01:29:10,011 --> 01:29:13,310
Iocated in neutral space
between several governments.

1331
01:29:13,815 --> 01:29:16,648
Together,
we stood on the eve of destruction...

1332
01:29:17,352 --> 01:29:20,321
as a result of a terrible, terrible mistake.

1333
01:29:21,289 --> 01:29:24,315
A mistake which none of us
can afford to make again.

1334
01:29:25,193 --> 01:29:30,187
The Babylon Station is a place
to work out our problems peacefully.

1335
01:29:31,699 --> 01:29:33,291
It is, we believe...

1336
01:29:33,735 --> 01:29:36,863
our last best hope for peace.

1337
01:29:41,409 --> 01:29:43,570
But like all good things...

1338
01:29:44,679 --> 01:29:47,341
it took them a while to work it all out.

1339
01:29:49,083 --> 01:29:51,381
There. You have your story.

1340
01:29:51,886 --> 01:29:53,319
You must go now.

1341
01:29:53,388 --> 01:29:54,878
I have things to do.

1342
01:30:07,802 --> 01:30:10,930
I hope they were not an inconvenience,
Majesty.

1343
01:30:11,539 --> 01:30:13,268
No. Thank you...

1344
01:30:13,441 --> 01:30:16,376
for allowing me to see joy
one more time...

1345
01:30:16,878 --> 01:30:18,038
before it gets...

1346
01:30:18,112 --> 01:30:20,239
too dark for me to see anything...

1347
01:30:20,348 --> 01:30:21,406
anymore.

1348
01:30:31,893 --> 01:30:33,258
Dear lady...

1349
01:30:35,129 --> 01:30:37,188
I would love to walk with you...

1350
01:30:37,265 --> 01:30:38,425
on a beach.

1351
01:30:40,435 --> 01:30:41,527
Somewhere.

1352
01:30:44,205 --> 01:30:46,230
For just five minutes.

1353
01:30:50,778 --> 01:30:52,439
How strange...

1354
01:30:52,713 --> 01:30:54,408
to have come so far...

1355
01:30:54,882 --> 01:30:56,611
and to want so little.

1356
01:31:00,154 --> 01:31:01,485
Children...

1357
01:31:03,825 --> 01:31:05,725
will you remember this story?

1358
01:31:06,627 --> 01:31:08,458
Will you remember me?

1359
01:31:08,763 --> 01:31:10,594
All my life, Majesty.

1360
01:31:13,734 --> 01:31:15,463
Very well. Go.

1361
01:31:17,538 --> 01:31:20,063
What about Sheridan and Delenn?

1362
01:31:20,208 --> 01:31:22,233
What about the end of the story?

1363
01:31:23,244 --> 01:31:25,974
Sheridan became president
of a great alliance...

1364
01:31:26,614 --> 01:31:28,479
Delenn ever at his side.

1365
01:31:29,650 --> 01:31:30,844
The story...

1366
01:31:32,320 --> 01:31:33,685
is not over yet.

1367
01:31:35,356 --> 01:31:38,450
The story is never over.

1368
01:31:41,262 --> 01:31:42,490
Now go.

1369
01:31:47,368 --> 01:31:49,495
Did they live happily ever after?

1370
01:31:49,570 --> 01:31:50,764
Lyssa.

1371
01:31:52,273 --> 01:31:54,468
Did they live happily ever after?

1372
01:31:56,611 --> 01:31:58,579
That remains to be seen.

1373
01:32:20,434 --> 01:32:22,197
I need another bottle.

1374
01:32:23,571 --> 01:32:25,664
I will need several more bottles.

1375
01:32:26,541 --> 01:32:27,667
And then...

1376
01:32:28,943 --> 01:32:30,535
wait one hour...

1377
01:32:31,145 --> 01:32:33,045
and bring the prisoners here.

1378
01:32:43,558 --> 01:32:46,686
They are allowing us
one last moment together before...

1379
01:32:48,729 --> 01:32:50,253
It's all right, John.

1380
01:32:51,032 --> 01:32:54,024
I accepted this fate a long time ago.

1381
01:32:54,735 --> 01:32:56,600
They cannot touch me.

1382
01:32:57,238 --> 01:32:58,728
They cannot harm me.

1383
01:32:59,240 --> 01:33:00,537
I'm not afraid.

1384
01:33:01,208 --> 01:33:02,835
Not if you are with me.

1385
01:33:03,711 --> 01:33:05,542
Our son is safe.

1386
01:33:05,947 --> 01:33:07,642
That's all that matters.

1387
01:33:08,215 --> 01:33:09,239
John...

1388
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:11,044
I love you.

1389
01:33:11,118 --> 01:33:12,380
To the future.

1390
01:33:13,154 --> 01:33:14,519
My old friends.

1391
01:34:08,943 --> 01:34:09,967
English
