00:18:08,653 --> 00:18:10,888
[Chuckles]

174
00:18:11,756 --> 00:18:13,640
We good?

175
00:18:14,259 --> 00:18:16,076
We're good.

176
00:18:17,078 --> 00:18:18,829
Good.

177
00:18:18,897 --> 00:18:22,015
I think I know someone
who might tell us
what that code means.

178
00:18:28,123 --> 00:18:31,225
Did you see it comin'?
[Sean]
See what?

179
00:18:31,292 --> 00:18:33,693
The plague.
No. Nobody did.

180
00:18:33,761 --> 00:18:35,862
The fallout caused
the P-19 strain.

181
00:18:35,930 --> 00:18:37,932
P-19s my ass.

182
00:18:38,833 --> 00:18:41,552
Every living person is sick.

183
00:18:41,619 --> 00:18:44,621
So we call it
like we see it.

184
00:18:44,689 --> 00:18:48,842
We're the lowest value
of what's left.
We're pennies.

185
00:18:49,794 --> 00:18:51,778
[Sean]
Yeah. Everyone's a penny.

186
00:18:51,846 --> 00:18:54,097
[Chuckles]
Nah. Not everybody.

187
00:18:54,165 --> 00:18:57,417
You heard about
the steels, right?

188
00:18:57,485 --> 00:19:02,939
People say the plague's effect
was reverse on steels,

189
00:19:03,007 --> 00:19:05,875
making them twice as strong...

190
00:19:05,943 --> 00:19:09,446
and giving them superpowers,

191
00:19:09,514 --> 00:19:11,448
like Superman.

192
00:19:12,884 --> 00:19:14,385
Superpowers, huh?

193
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:17,321
How do you know
I'm not a steel?

194
00:19:18,756 --> 00:19:20,857
[Groans]

195
00:19:20,926 --> 00:19:22,859
Son of a bitch.

196
00:19:23,694 --> 00:19:25,629
You're a penny all right.

197
00:19:26,798 --> 00:19:29,032
So you've seen
these steels?

198
00:19:29,100 --> 00:19:31,368
No, not personally.

199
00:19:31,436 --> 00:19:34,938
I heard,
in the Northern Province,

200
00:19:35,006 --> 00:19:37,173
they have a bunch of pennies.

201
00:19:37,241 --> 00:19:40,243
One of 'em got trapped
in a hundred-foot avalanche.

202
00:19:41,245 --> 00:19:43,580
Pulled his way out.

203
00:19:43,648 --> 00:19:48,285
And then he got shot
in the heart
by a bunch of P.O.'s.

204
00:19:52,791 --> 00:19:55,559
Walked away
without a scratch on him.

205
00:19:57,595 --> 00:19:59,797
Yeah, right.

206
00:19:59,864 --> 00:20:01,899
So where are you
taking me anyway?

207
00:20:03,468 --> 00:20:06,202
There's a guy named Shiv
I want you to meet.

208
00:20:07,439 --> 00:20:09,440
Code breaker back in the war.

209
00:20:11,108 --> 00:20:13,944
But I warn you--
[Chuckles]

210
00:20:14,011 --> 00:20:17,047
he's a little shell-shocked,
if you know what I mean.

211
00:20:17,114 --> 00:20:22,018
He's a half-boiled egg.
You know, he's two cans short--
I got it, I got it, I got it.

212
00:20:23,621 --> 00:20:25,589
I know a guy like that.

213
00:20:29,127 --> 00:20:31,128
[Phone Rings]

214
00:20:32,847 --> 00:20:35,332
Nate, is your light broke?

215
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:37,484
Aw, geez.

216
00:20:37,552 --> 00:20:39,453
Have you been here all night?

217
00:20:39,521 --> 00:20:42,589
I told you you can come
stay with me anytime, man.
This is not healthy.

218
00:20:42,657 --> 00:20:45,325
Oh, Jesus, man.
They are at it again.

219
00:20:45,393 --> 00:20:47,894
They are--
We are in deep shit, man.

220
00:20:47,962 --> 00:20:50,847
It is unbelievable, man.
Nate, I don't think
you should be--

221
00:20:50,915 --> 00:20:54,851
Oh. Yeah. Ju-Just--
Just-- Just take a look
at this, okay?

222
00:20:54,919 --> 00:20:57,638
Just take a look at it. Please.

223
00:20:59,057 --> 00:21:00,524
Okay?

224
00:21:01,726 --> 00:21:04,744
They're aimed now
at North Korea.

225
00:21:04,812 --> 00:21:07,214
And, uh--
[Chuckles]

226
00:21:07,282 --> 00:21:10,617
our government is lying
to its people.

227
00:21:10,685 --> 00:21:12,553
And-And-And
believe you me, we--

228
00:21:12,620 --> 00:21:17,491
we are gonna be playing
pin the tail on some
really pissed-off donkeys.

229
00:21:17,558 --> 00:21:21,412
Nate, I told you, man.
You can't believe everything
you read on those blog sites.

230
00:21:21,479 --> 00:21:25,282
You know, they're full of--
no offense--
conspiracy theorists.

231
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:28,952
Yeah, well, that's not the only
thing they-- they say, and--

232
00:21:30,955 --> 00:21:33,323
How much money do you make?

233
00:21:33,391 --> 00:21:37,411
- Oh--
- Okay, okay. Have you ever
put your money into stock?

234
00:21:37,479 --> 00:21:40,380
- Man, I don't have
enough money to--
- Okay.

235
00:21:40,448 --> 00:21:44,751
These sites can also
mathematically determine...

236
00:21:44,818 --> 00:21:48,355
what are gonna be
the highest-yielding
stocks to buy...

237
00:21:48,423 --> 00:21:52,259
i-if the nation
moves into the next stage
of-of the war.

238
00:21:52,327 --> 00:21:54,444
[Chuckles]
Like, um,

239
00:21:54,512 --> 00:21:56,697
this company.

240
00:21:56,764 --> 00:21:58,631
VMI.

241
00:21:59,534 --> 00:22:02,352
They-They make,
uh, warfare--

242
00:22:02,419 --> 00:22:04,855
weapons
and-and-and body armor.

243
00:22:04,922 --> 00:22:07,674
Uh, it's, um, uh, "Kelvar."
You ever heard of that?

244
00:22:07,742 --> 00:22:09,042
Kevlar?
Kevlar.

245
00:22:09,109 --> 00:22:11,478
Um, yeah.
Um, uh, they, uh--

246
00:22:11,546 --> 00:22:14,631
Think-Think that,
only, uh, thinner.

247
00:22:14,699 --> 00:22:17,684
These guys say that
it can, uh, dense up...

248
00:22:17,751 --> 00:22:20,653
when-when--
when a bullet hits it.

249
00:22:20,721 --> 00:22:23,156
It's frickin'
amazing stuff, man. Okay?

250
00:22:23,224 --> 00:22:28,094
When they're done with
these tests, this VMI
stock is gonna be like--

251
00:22:28,162 --> 00:22:31,664
like fishing with dynamite,
you know.

252
00:22:31,732 --> 00:22:34,584
This is guaranteed money.
A lock.

253
00:22:38,089 --> 00:22:39,990
[Crickets Chirping]

254
00:22:41,626 --> 00:22:44,027
You sure you know
where you're going?

255
00:22:44,095 --> 00:22:45,596
Don't worry.

256
00:22:49,333 --> 00:22:51,367
I know what I'm doing.

257
00:22:51,936 --> 00:22:53,436
What's today?

258
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:58,158
I don't know.
I haven't known days in years.

259
00:23:00,060 --> 00:23:03,796
Florida dipped off
in the ocean
not too long ago.

260
00:23:03,864 --> 00:23:06,399
I don't know how many states
that leaves, but...

261
00:23:06,467 --> 00:23:08,501
I got my money on 13.

262
00:23:10,003 --> 00:23:12,672
Thirteen provinces, huh?

263
00:23:12,740 --> 00:23:14,941
Don't you think
that's a little ironic?

264
00:23:16,744 --> 00:23:18,245
Okay.

265
00:23:21,582 --> 00:23:24,584
You have any idea
where the hell you're going?
Shut up.

266
00:23:42,069 --> 00:23:44,070
Is this it?

267
00:23:44,138 --> 00:23:45,872
No.

268
00:23:45,940 --> 00:23:48,141
I don't know what this is.

269
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:20,674
[Wood Creaks]

270
00:24:22,176 --> 00:24:23,627
[Hinges Creak]

271
00:24:41,678 --> 00:24:43,964
Be with you in one second.

272
00:24:44,032 --> 00:24:46,899
What are you guys
in the mood for?
'20s flapper?

273
00:24:46,967 --> 00:24:50,386
You want a cheerleader,
schoolgirl? What?

274
00:24:53,324 --> 00:24:56,593
You guys new?
You don't know the drill?

275
00:24:56,660 --> 00:24:58,628
No. We know the drill.

276
00:25:00,248 --> 00:25:02,582
Waiting for you to come out.

277
00:25:06,537 --> 00:25:08,154
You guys
want some coffee?

278
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:10,023
Yeah.

279
00:25:11,025 --> 00:25:13,342
Um, let's see.

280
00:25:13,410 --> 00:25:16,646
I'm not sure
if I have enough. Um--

281
00:25:16,714 --> 00:25:19,248
[Gun Cocks]
All right, assholes.
What do you want?

282
00:25:21,252 --> 00:25:22,986
Coffee's good.

283
00:25:23,053 --> 00:25:26,239
[Sean]
We just came across this cabin.
That's all. Got curious.

284
00:25:26,306 --> 00:25:28,508
Just looking for my wife.

285
00:25:28,576 --> 00:25:31,677
You said you're looking
for your wife?

286
00:25:31,745 --> 00:25:35,949
All the way from Los Angeles.
Every day for the past
five years.

287
00:25:38,936 --> 00:25:40,353
Look.

288
00:25:40,421 --> 00:25:42,389
I'm sorry for the trouble.

289
00:25:42,456 --> 00:25:44,391
We'll just
see ourselves out.

290
00:25:49,546 --> 00:25:50,981
Hold on.

291
00:25:53,067 --> 00:25:55,268
You don't
have to go.

292
00:25:58,189 --> 00:26:00,156
I'm Zoona.

293
00:26:01,525 --> 00:26:03,159
I'm Sean.

294
00:26:03,227 --> 00:26:05,362
That's my husband.

295
00:26:05,430 --> 00:26:07,531
We took that in Vegas.

296
00:26:07,598 --> 00:26:10,783
The year before--
well, you know.

297
00:26:10,851 --> 00:26:12,318
[Sean]
Is he--

298
00:26:12,386 --> 00:26:15,438
He was in Houston
on business
when the bombs hit there.

299
00:26:16,673 --> 00:26:18,774
He was the only
decent guy I ever knew.

300
00:26:23,881 --> 00:26:25,415
That's Katie.

301
00:26:25,483 --> 00:26:27,867
[Zoona]
She's beautiful.

302
00:26:27,935 --> 00:26:29,686
Yeah.

303
00:26:37,761 --> 00:26:39,795
So what are you doing
out here anyway?

304
00:26:39,863 --> 00:26:41,781
I work for the province.

305
00:26:41,849 --> 00:26:44,617
I have been
for the past two years.

306
00:26:44,685 --> 00:26:48,421
They put me out here
for the officers
who patrol the outskirts.

307
00:26:48,489 --> 00:26:52,826
They let me live here,
safely, don't give me
any trouble.

308
00:26:52,893 --> 00:26:54,977
[Chuckles]

309
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:57,213
Sounds like a bunch of
bullshit to me.

310
00:26:57,281 --> 00:26:59,065
First of all,

311
00:26:59,133 --> 00:27:02,786
if the P.O.'s
found you out here,
they'd lock you up,

312
00:27:02,853 --> 00:27:04,871
take this place over
for themselves.

313
00:27:04,939 --> 00:27:08,892
And secondly, why the hell
would they bring you out here
in the middle of nowhere,

314
00:27:08,960 --> 00:27:10,593
all alone?

315
00:27:12,013 --> 00:27:13,813
I give them favors.

316
00:27:13,880 --> 00:27:15,599
So you cook?

317
00:27:15,666 --> 00:27:17,717
Not exactly.

318
00:27:17,784 --> 00:27:20,003
What do you do then?

319
00:27:21,822 --> 00:27:24,040
She gives them favors, Jax.

320
00:27:25,042 --> 00:27:27,043
You do remember
favors, right?

321
00:27:35,536 --> 00:27:37,120
Oh.

322
00:27:38,389 --> 00:27:40,256
[Jax Chuckles]

323
00:27:40,324 --> 00:27:42,759
You'll have to excuse him.
He lost his glasses.

324
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:45,161
He, uh, obviously can't see
how pretty you are.

325
00:27:45,229 --> 00:27:47,196
Want to do me a favor?

326
00:27:47,264 --> 00:27:49,482
[Chuckles]

327
00:27:50,117 --> 00:27:51,701
You sure?

328
00:27:55,405 --> 00:27:57,624
You don't know
what you're missing.

329
00:27:59,944 --> 00:28:01,377
[Sighs]

330
00:28:02,330 --> 00:28:04,263
So how do they trust you?

331
00:28:04,332 --> 00:28:06,566
The province.
How do they know
they can trust you?

332
00:28:06,634 --> 00:28:08,568
I've earned it.

333
00:28:08,635 --> 00:28:10,870
I've been loyal
for a long time.

334
00:28:10,938 --> 00:28:13,539
They give me food,
shelter, the penny pill.

335
00:28:13,607 --> 00:28:16,709
Out here it doesn't get
much better than this.

336
00:28:16,777 --> 00:28:19,246
It's heaven
compared to the camps.

337
00:28:19,313 --> 00:28:20,813
The camps?

338
00:28:20,882 --> 00:28:23,816
The province has these camps
set up all over the greenland--

339
00:28:23,885 --> 00:28:27,587
forced prostitution camps,
strictly for the officers
and soldiers.

340
00:28:27,655 --> 00:28:31,691
They have to keep the women
in camps because, if not,
they'll try to escape.

341
00:28:31,758 --> 00:28:33,759
[Sean]
These-- These camps--
are they all women?

342
00:28:33,827 --> 00:28:38,648
Yeah, but they have other camps
for the men and women that don't
make officer-- work camps.

343
00:28:38,715 --> 00:28:43,269
Everyone else they deem unfit
for the province, they either

00:28:43,337 --> 00:28:45,771
What about the names
of these camps?
Can you remember any?

345
00:28:45,839 --> 00:28:48,341
Why?
Oh, come on, Zoona.
Just help me out.

346
00:28:48,409 --> 00:28:50,776
The names of the camps.
Can you remember any of them?

347
00:28:50,844 --> 00:28:55,615
Um, there's Lincoln,
Dooly, Athens, Georgetown.

348
00:28:55,683 --> 00:28:58,618
Georgetown?
Yeah.

349
00:28:58,686 --> 00:29:01,087
Georgetown's
a prostitution camp?

350
00:29:01,154 --> 00:29:02,755
Yeah.

351
00:29:02,823 --> 00:29:05,592

Were you there?
Did you ever go to Georgetown?

352
00:29:05,659 --> 00:29:07,427
Yeah.
Did you see her?

353
00:29:07,494 --> 00:29:09,462
Did you see her there?
Wait. Wait.

354
00:29:09,530 --> 00:29:11,797
Where did you
get this paper?
Is there a Kate Johnson?

355
00:29:11,865 --> 00:29:14,634
I called her Katie,
but on the list,
it's listed as "Kate."

356
00:29:14,702 --> 00:29:17,737
Where did you get this?
Are you guys part of
the underground?

357

No! I just need to know,
have you seen her?

I shouldn't turn you guys in
right now.

Okay? So, shoot me,
turn me in, do whatever
you gotta do,

362
00:29:35,873 --> 00:29:37,891
but I have to know,
have you seen her?

363
00:29:40,878 --> 00:29:43,163
Sean, I'm sorry.
I haven't seen her.

00:29:43,230 --> 00:29:45,598
You smell like a--
Oh, man. You're sick, man.

365
00:29:45,666 --> 00:29:48,384
Look. You have to go.
If they find you,
they'll kill you.

366
00:29:48,452 --> 00:29:50,486
And then they'll kill me.

372
00:30:01,732 --> 00:30:03,866
I didn't come here
for no damn coffee.

call me Clarence, didn't I?

I gotta do
what's best for me.

00:40:03,600 --> 00:40:05,384
Of course you do.

00:40:09,172 --> 00:40:11,690

a responsibility...

to lead by example.

486

...and answered
their call of duty...

487
00:41:34,607 --> 00:41:37,476
to join the fight
for their country.

488
00:41:37,544 --> 00:41:39,561
Doesn't scare you at all,
does it?

489
00:41:40,546 --> 00:41:42,598
I'm just saying he won
with 87% of the vote.

490
00:41:42,665 --> 00:41:44,749
I mean, he is
pretty much untouchable.

491
00:41:44,817 --> 00:41:46,485
And did you vote?

492
00:41:46,553 --> 00:41:49,421
- No.
- The talks did not go as well
as we had hoped.

493
00:41:49,489 --> 00:41:51,607
Come on. Like it would have
even made a dent.

00:41:51,674 --> 00:41:54,860

are backing us at all?

letting other people's opinions
affect yours.

your head all filled...

with these
conspiracy theories,

00:42:06,373 --> 00:42:09,274
when it should be
focused on... me.

499
00:42:09,342 --> 00:42:11,827
Every reserve will be
recalled to active duty,

500
00:42:11,895 --> 00:42:17,483
and all of our active
military will move to
a level orange status.

You promise me
it doesn't bother you--

when we get married?

was Jeeley-Squire.

if Nathaniel's right,

507
00:42:35,435 --> 00:42:38,404
we have a lot of tuna and
bottled water to stock up on.

508

Hold on.

509
00:42:41,441 --> 00:42:44,009

bigger than this.

Sean, it's perfect.

511
00:42:46,979 --> 00:42:50,582
Besides, it's not the size
of the stone that matters to me.

512
00:42:50,650 --> 00:42:53,452
It's the size of--
of the heart.

513
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,822
I started this war,
and I'll finish it.
I'm never gonna take it off.

00:42:59,108 --> 00:43:00,809
Welcome.
Sean. This is Katie.

515
00:43:00,877 --> 00:43:02,895
- Sean. Katie. Pleasure.
- [Katie]
Nice to meet you.

516
00:43:02,962 --> 00:43:04,129
Nice to meet you too.

517
00:43:06,633 --> 00:43:10,336
[Katie]
I love this house.
I want this house.

518
00:43:10,403 --> 00:43:12,538
[Sean] I know, Katie.
It's perfect.
I know. It's just--

519
00:43:12,606 --> 00:43:14,573
It's twice as much
as we can afford.

520
00:43:14,641 --> 00:43:19,061
I'll get a second job. I'll--
I'll work the streets at night.

521
00:43:19,129 --> 00:43:20,996
Come on.

522
00:43:21,064 --> 00:43:23,832
Can you imagine you and me,

523
00:43:23,900 --> 00:43:26,268
little Cole and little Sarah?

524
00:43:26,336 --> 00:43:27,836
Katie, I--

525
00:43:29,372 --> 00:43:31,006
Don't do--

526
00:43:31,992 --> 00:43:34,343
We'd have
an amazing life here.

527
00:43:34,411 --> 00:43:36,345
We deserve this house.

528
00:43:36,413 --> 00:43:38,747
It'll be the best
investment we'll ever make.

529
00:43:45,788 --> 00:43:49,157
All right. Well, promise me
you won't hang a painting
of your mom in this room.

530
00:43:49,226 --> 00:43:50,726
Sean!

531
00:43:54,964 --> 00:43:56,898
[Phone Rings]

532
00:44:00,203 --> 00:44:04,589
Hey, Nate. Nate, Nate.
Hey, man. Is that site still
predicting that stock to go up?

533
00:44:04,741 --> 00:44:07,443
And, uh--
[Chuckles]
What site would that be?

534
00:44:07,510 --> 00:44:10,946
- The one with the missiles
and the body armor stuff.
- VMI?

535
00:44:11,013 --> 00:44:12,297
VMI. Yeah.

536
00:44:12,365 --> 00:44:14,249
Oh. So you want in, huh?

537
00:44:15,101 --> 00:44:17,185
Yeah. Yeah.
I-I want in.

538
00:44:17,253 --> 00:44:18,904
How much?

539
00:44:32,736 --> 00:44:35,554
They have medication.

540
00:44:35,622 --> 00:44:38,624
How many total?
That's it. Just two.

541
00:44:40,327 --> 00:44:43,495
- How are we on the perimeter?
- All clear.

542
00:44:43,563 --> 00:44:45,197
Okay. Go.

543
00:44:53,657 --> 00:44:59,128
It's hard staying away from
people when the greenlands
just keep getting smaller.

544
00:45:00,363 --> 00:45:03,265
If they're
rebuilding the U.S.,

545
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:05,367
well, they're damn sure
not doing it here.

546
00:45:05,435 --> 00:45:10,072
So, if we're friends,
why don't you show me
that paper?

547
00:45:11,290 --> 00:45:13,892
The orders from province
you showed that whore.

548
00:45:13,960 --> 00:45:16,795
It's nothing.
Fuck you.

549
00:45:17,580 --> 00:45:19,598
It's nothing.
Fuck you.

550
00:45:19,665 --> 00:45:21,666
I just killed
a fucking P.O. for you.

551
00:45:23,770 --> 00:45:27,489
So we're connected
whether you like it or not.

552
00:45:28,692 --> 00:45:31,627
There's a list,
all right?

553
00:45:31,695 --> 00:45:33,596
I think my wife
may be on that list.

554
00:45:35,298 --> 00:45:37,382
After what Zoona said,
I just--

555
00:45:40,052 --> 00:45:42,454
I have to know
if it might be her.

556
00:45:44,507 --> 00:45:47,109
I knew it.

557
00:45:49,979 --> 00:45:52,314
We're being followed.

558
00:46:04,310 --> 00:46:06,277
Just don't speed up.

559
00:46:06,345 --> 00:46:08,346
They'll know
that we see 'em.

560
00:46:09,248 --> 00:46:11,316
You hear me, Jax?

561
00:46:13,236 --> 00:46:15,204
- Jax?
- [Shotgun Cocks]

562
00:46:17,724 --> 00:46:21,593
- Give us those pills, we'll
let you and your friend go.
- I'm not giving you anything.

563
00:46:26,115 --> 00:46:28,049
That's what
we'd hoped you'd say.

564
00:46:29,452 --> 00:46:31,320
[Sean Breathing Heavily]

565
00:46:35,558 --> 00:46:37,960
[Man Chattering]
[Woman]
You're gonna blow our cover!

566
00:46:38,027 --> 00:46:40,745
[Chattering]

567
00:46:40,864 --> 00:46:42,865
[Woman]
What bag?
[Man] Where's his bag?

568
00:46:42,932 --> 00:46:46,034
[Man #2] Don't touch his bag?
Take the hood off.
I got his bag right here.

569
00:46:59,349 --> 00:47:00,999
Good evening.

570
00:47:01,067 --> 00:47:04,986
I trust if we release you
from the trap,
you'll not contest.

571
00:47:05,054 --> 00:47:09,174
- What did you do with Jax?
- Still breathing-- barely.

572
00:47:11,610 --> 00:47:13,845
[Grunts]
Just give me the word, Red.

573
00:47:13,913 --> 00:47:16,198
I swear to God!
Just give me the word!

574
00:47:17,316 --> 00:47:19,351
Do you know who we are?

575
00:47:20,470 --> 00:47:21,703
No.

576
00:47:21,771 --> 00:47:24,039
We are called The Voice.

577
00:47:26,809 --> 00:47:28,810
You're the underground?

578
00:47:28,878 --> 00:47:31,563
[Chuckles]
You're as bad as they are.

579
00:47:31,631 --> 00:47:33,165
Takin' prisoners,
killing people.

580
00:47:33,233 --> 00:47:35,417
If we wanted to kill you,
you would be dead.

581
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:38,837
The province has
given themselves the power
over life and death.

582
00:47:41,057 --> 00:47:43,942
And those who
the province divides...

583
00:47:44,010 --> 00:47:45,677
we unite.

584
00:47:49,415 --> 00:47:51,750
[Men Chattering]
[Dog Barking In Distance]

585
00:47:52,752 --> 00:47:54,953
Get in there.

586
00:47:56,723 --> 00:47:59,090
What do you have to say
for yourself, Zoona?

587
00:47:59,158 --> 00:48:02,527
You know you put this
on yourself.
Fuck you.

588
00:48:02,595 --> 00:48:07,165
[Chuckles]
There's nothing more I'd like
to do than to do that right now.

589
00:48:08,367 --> 00:48:10,853
But my commander's
setting up your sentence,

590
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:13,204
and you ain't gonna be
in here real long.

591
00:48:18,894 --> 00:48:20,729
[Breathing Heavily]

592
00:48:21,464 --> 00:48:23,432
Don't touch that one.

593
00:48:23,499 --> 00:48:27,636
She's got lice and some kind of
fungus and no telling
what other kind of shit.

594
00:48:29,138 --> 00:48:33,542
Personally, I think her pussy
may move on its own.
[Chuckles]

595
00:48:36,662 --> 00:48:38,747
Thanks for your concern,

596
00:48:39,515 --> 00:48:41,316
Clarence.

597
00:48:44,470 --> 00:48:46,438
I told you
not to call me Clarence!

598
00:48:49,275 --> 00:48:51,943
Personally I hope
they don't kill you.

599
00:48:52,011 --> 00:48:57,148
I'm really gonna miss you
bobbing up and down
on my Lincoln Log.

600
00:48:58,317 --> 00:48:59,818
Bitch.

601
00:49:02,622 --> 00:49:04,890
[Chains Rattling]

602
00:49:06,159 --> 00:49:08,510
[Woman Chuckling]

603
00:49:08,578 --> 00:49:10,495
[Coughs]

604
00:49:10,563 --> 00:49:12,847
[Chuckling, Coughing]

605
00:49:14,033 --> 00:49:16,201
[Zoona]
What are you
laughing at?

606
00:49:18,671 --> 00:49:20,405
Myers.

607
00:49:20,473 --> 00:49:23,708
I've never heard anyone
talk to him like that...

608
00:49:23,776 --> 00:49:25,810
and live to talk about it.

609
00:49:27,664 --> 00:49:30,131
His name's Clarence?

610
00:49:31,583 --> 00:49:33,919
They say I'm stage three--

611
00:49:34,553 --> 00:49:36,121
unworthy.

612
00:49:36,956 --> 00:49:40,342
Sorry.
Were you in a camp?

613
00:49:41,560 --> 00:49:43,411
Yeah. Georgetown.

614
00:49:45,965 --> 00:49:48,099
You were at Georgetown?

615
00:49:49,818 --> 00:49:51,503
That's still
a prostitution camp, right?

616
00:49:52,855 --> 00:49:54,823
That's what everyone thinks.

617
00:49:54,891 --> 00:49:57,676
[Man Shouts]
[Woman]
It used to be,

618
00:49:57,743 --> 00:50:00,478
but not anymore.

619
00:50:00,546 --> 00:50:02,280
Come on. Let's move!
Get in here! Get in here!

620
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:04,500
Oh! Look at
what we got in here!
Move, move!

621
00:50:04,567 --> 00:50:08,169
Now, it's more like
a holding area than a camp.

622
00:50:08,237 --> 00:50:10,989
[Man]
Go! Come on!
Let's move!

623
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:14,709
[Man Coughs]

624
00:50:14,777 --> 00:50:15,911
Divide them up.

625
00:50:15,979 --> 00:50:18,930
- [All Shouting]
- Come on! Get over there!
Get over there!

626
00:50:18,998 --> 00:50:20,565
Get over there!

No!

628
00:50:33,529 --> 00:50:35,063
No!

629
00:50:36,832 --> 00:50:38,783
[Sobs]
No! No!

630
00:50:38,935 --> 00:50:41,103
It's horrible.

631
00:50:41,254 --> 00:50:43,304
But they keep us healthy.

632
00:50:43,372 --> 00:50:45,607
[Clears Throat]
Most of us anyway.

633
00:50:47,276 --> 00:50:49,761
You know what,
this is gonna sound crazy,

634
00:50:49,829 --> 00:50:51,763
but when you were in the camp,

635
00:50:51,831 --> 00:50:54,433
did you ever hear of a girl
named Kate Johnson?

636
00:50:56,853 --> 00:50:59,171
I knew a Kate,

637
00:50:59,238 --> 00:51:01,824
but I don't know
if it was her.

638
00:51:01,891 --> 00:51:03,692
She was code 99.

639
00:51:04,594 --> 00:51:08,479
The very rare blood types.

640
00:51:08,547 --> 00:51:12,734
The province scientists believe
that by using our blood type...

641
00:51:12,802 --> 00:51:18,756
they can create a vaccine
to wipe away
the P-19 virus altogether.

642
00:51:18,824 --> 00:51:21,659
Once they create
that antidote,

643
00:51:21,727 --> 00:51:24,429
they'll give birth
to pure code 99s...

644
00:51:24,497 --> 00:51:28,766
and ensure
a healthy society at the Haven.

645
00:51:28,834 --> 00:51:31,169
They make the medications there.

646
00:51:32,605 --> 00:51:37,442
They're going to build
the entire United Province.

647
00:51:37,510 --> 00:51:40,645
That's where we need to be--
in the Haven.

648
00:51:45,201 --> 00:51:47,102
[Crickets Chirping]

649
00:51:53,109 --> 00:51:56,812
So you were following us?
You have something we need.

650
00:51:56,879 --> 00:51:59,047
You got a hell of a way
of asking.

651
00:51:59,115 --> 00:52:01,083
You were in a hot zone.

652
00:52:01,150 --> 00:52:04,252
Would you have rather us
left you swimming out there
in a sea of P.O.'s?

653
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:10,391
What exactly
do you need?

654
00:52:11,861 --> 00:52:13,929
We need
your medication.

655
00:52:15,481 --> 00:52:18,350
Now, why should I believe
you need it any more
than we do?

656
00:52:18,417 --> 00:52:22,587
We got people here
with advanced conditions
of the plague.

657
00:52:22,654 --> 00:52:25,023
You and your friend--
I mean, you're still
at stage one.

658
00:52:25,091 --> 00:52:28,944
These people are at stage three.
They might die tomorrow
without medication.

659
00:52:38,487 --> 00:52:40,305
You'll let Jax go?

660
00:52:42,608 --> 00:52:44,109
All right.

661
00:52:46,712 --> 00:52:48,213
All right.

662
00:52:52,602 --> 00:52:54,586
Thank you.

663
00:52:54,653 --> 00:52:56,671
We would have
let him go anyway.

664
00:52:59,725 --> 00:53:03,128
You see, no matter
where we came from,
we're all the same here.

665
00:53:03,196 --> 00:53:04,479
[Coughing]

666
00:53:04,547 --> 00:53:06,948
I mean, Pollack--
Pollack was a dentist.

667
00:53:07,015 --> 00:53:10,051
Tereshinski
was a schoolteacher.
Krannen--

668
00:53:10,119 --> 00:53:12,070
Krannen was a thief.

669
00:53:13,539 --> 00:53:15,473
And you?

670
00:53:17,627 --> 00:53:19,360
I was a grandfather.

671
00:53:28,537 --> 00:53:30,988
Red, these men--

672
00:53:31,056 --> 00:53:33,558
they follow you,
they believe in you.

673
00:53:33,626 --> 00:53:35,960
Yeah.
Why don't you
fight back now?

674
00:53:36,028 --> 00:53:40,031
Uh, the enemy countries
who survived the bomb--

675
00:53:40,099 --> 00:53:43,251
their soldiers
are coming here to claim
this land as their own...

676
00:53:43,769 --> 00:53:45,987
after the plague has passed.

677
00:53:46,055 --> 00:53:49,257
We have to be a united front
on that day.

678
00:53:49,408 --> 00:53:51,209
But for now,

679
00:53:51,277 --> 00:53:54,129
the Vision grow stronger.

680
00:53:54,197 --> 00:53:56,965
And we'll know
when it's time to rise
when he comes.

681
00:53:58,217 --> 00:53:59,884
Who's "he"?

682
00:53:59,952 --> 00:54:02,287
The Great Steel.
He's making his way to us.

683
00:54:02,355 --> 00:54:07,342
Look, he defeated
an entire officer camp
in the Orleans Province.

684
00:54:07,409 --> 00:54:11,980
I mean, drops of his blood
healed a sick bay
of 500 pennies...

685
00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:13,715
in the northern deadlands.

686
00:54:13,783 --> 00:54:16,852
I mean, he's unstoppable,
and with us fighting
by his side,

687
00:54:16,919 --> 00:54:18,837
we can take back
what is ours.

688
00:54:20,306 --> 00:54:24,108
Man, these stories,
they're just... stories.

689
00:54:24,176 --> 00:54:26,077
You're the leader
of these men.

690
00:54:26,145 --> 00:54:28,129
The Steel?

691
00:54:28,197 --> 00:54:30,164
Just a myth.

692
00:54:31,200 --> 00:54:33,501
[Chuckles]
A myth?

693
00:54:35,838 --> 00:54:38,073
A myth!
[Laughs]

694
00:54:40,509 --> 00:54:42,678
The Steel is coming,
and when he does,

695
00:54:42,745 --> 00:54:45,947
we'll never have to
spend another night
hiding in the shadows.

696
00:54:48,384 --> 00:54:49,885
Let's go.

697
00:54:51,854 --> 00:54:54,356
[Muttering]

698
00:54:54,423 --> 00:54:56,091
Son of a fuckin' whore.

699
00:54:56,158 --> 00:54:59,060
If they're so fuckin' great,
why don't you fuckin'
ask 'em for help?

700
00:54:59,128 --> 00:55:01,696
I told you,
they have their fight,
and I have mine.

701
00:55:01,764 --> 00:55:03,781
[Whirring]
Shit.

702
00:55:04,984 --> 00:55:06,868
- Shit!
- Fucking shit!

703
00:55:07,019 --> 00:55:11,022
- Wh-What did it feel like?
- Like a-- Like a click.
Like a fucking click.

704
00:55:11,090 --> 00:55:14,525
- That's what it sounded like!
What'd it feel like?
- I don't know. Is it a mine?

705
00:55:14,593 --> 00:55:16,711
I don't know yet.
Okay. Uh--

706
00:55:16,779 --> 00:55:19,347
Just duck down,
take a look.
Duck down?

707
00:55:19,415 --> 00:55:22,383
Duck down, take a look!
Describe a few things.
Tell me what you see.

708
00:55:23,619 --> 00:55:25,787
And wipe off the dirt.
Slowly!

709
00:55:25,854 --> 00:55:29,107
All right, all right.
Now, is it green?

710
00:55:29,175 --> 00:55:30,858
Yeah. Yeah, it's green.

711
00:55:30,926 --> 00:55:35,597
Okay. Is there, uh,
ridges near the front end?

712
00:55:35,664 --> 00:55:38,650
- Which one's the front?
- Are there ridges
anywhere near it?

713
00:55:38,718 --> 00:55:40,685
- Yeah, yeah.
There's three of 'em.
- Fuck!

714
00:55:40,753 --> 00:55:43,704
Okay. It's homemade.
[Mutters]

715
00:55:43,772 --> 00:55:45,423
Okay, um-- Uh--

716
00:55:45,491 --> 00:55:49,710
Is there a small bump,
maybe the size of a ballpoint
pen, in the middle?

717
00:55:49,778 --> 00:55:51,029
- Where is it?
- In the middle!

718
00:55:51,096 --> 00:55:53,331
My foot's on the thing!
I can't see anything!

719
00:55:53,399 --> 00:55:54,883
[Rustles]

720
00:55:54,950 --> 00:55:57,351
There's something
out there in the bush.

721
00:56:05,177 --> 00:56:07,612
[Man]
You're now convicted
of trespassing!

722
00:56:08,314 --> 00:56:11,449
The penalty is death
by firing squad!

723
00:56:11,517 --> 00:56:14,752
Men, aim your weapons!

724
00:56:14,820 --> 00:56:17,371
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Shiv, Shiv, Shiv. Shiv.

725
00:56:17,439 --> 00:56:19,590
[Stammering]

726
00:56:19,658 --> 00:56:22,093
We-We just got lost.
We're not trespassing.

727
00:56:22,161 --> 00:56:25,196
[Shiv]
You, on the mine!
Pick it up!

728
00:56:25,264 --> 00:56:28,532
- Pick it up?
- I said, pick it up!

729
00:56:28,600 --> 00:56:31,319
All right, all right.
I got an idea.

730
00:56:31,387 --> 00:56:34,189
If you can keep it engaged,
it won't blow.

731
00:56:34,256 --> 00:56:37,108
Just don't take
your finger off.

732
00:56:40,713 --> 00:56:43,815
Okay.
I'm gonna pick it up.

733
00:56:50,056 --> 00:56:52,157
[Exhales]

734
00:57:03,919 --> 00:57:05,720

[Whirring]

736
00:57:10,609 --> 00:57:13,227
[Beeping]
It's a fucking dud.

737
00:57:14,446 --> 00:57:19,133
[Shiv Laughing]
You are one crazy
son of a bitch!

738
00:57:19,201 --> 00:57:21,819
[Laughing]
I like that!

739
00:57:24,506 --> 00:57:26,908
Is that Shiv?

740
00:57:26,976 --> 00:57:30,678
Hey, Shiv!
We got something
you might want to see.

741
00:57:32,014 --> 00:57:33,998
Okay, but just
the other one.

742
00:57:34,066 --> 00:57:36,617
Me and Jimmy don't
trust you no more, Jax.

743
00:57:43,292 --> 00:57:45,710
Oops! I almost forgot.

744
00:57:46,846 --> 00:57:48,412
Drop 'em, boys!

745
00:57:48,480 --> 00:57:50,364

746
00:57:55,687 --> 00:57:57,522

[Men Shouting, Faint]

749
00:58:12,121 --> 00:58:14,122
You're Harris, right?

750
00:58:15,624 --> 00:58:17,358
I'm Shockley.
David Shockley.

751
00:58:17,426 --> 00:58:19,427
I just came in to duty.

752
00:58:22,297 --> 00:58:24,699
You're something
of a legend around here.

753
00:58:27,286 --> 00:58:30,504
You were in the military
before it happened.

754
00:58:33,842 --> 00:58:36,427
I grew up
on a cattle ranch.

755
00:58:37,546 --> 00:58:41,199
We used to have
these wild hogs
on our land.

756
00:58:41,266 --> 00:58:43,101
They were a nuisance
really.

757
00:58:45,071 --> 00:58:47,922
Once a year
we'd round them up.

758
00:58:48,623 --> 00:58:50,708
My dad would shoot 'em.

759
00:58:52,411 --> 00:58:54,028
I never could.

760
00:58:56,382 --> 00:59:00,218
He'd say,
"After you get used to
hearing the screams,

761
00:59:00,285 --> 00:59:02,620
you just get
kind of numb to it."

762
00:59:04,390 --> 00:59:06,257
Is he right?

763
00:59:06,325 --> 00:59:09,327
I mean, you have
more confirmed kills
than the commander.

764
00:59:10,763 --> 00:59:12,764
Do you still hear
the screams?

765
00:59:20,305 --> 00:59:22,306
Do you still hear 'em?

766
00:59:24,176 --> 00:59:25,577
Yeah.

767
00:59:27,396 --> 00:59:28,896
Good.

768
00:59:30,666 --> 00:59:33,334
It's when you don't
that you need to
start being scared.

769
00:59:50,186 --> 00:59:52,420
[Whispers]
Talk to me for a second.

770
01:00:02,864 --> 01:00:04,865
Now, I'm not mad
at you, Zoona.

771
01:00:09,372 --> 01:00:12,356
You've done
a lot of good things
for this province.

772
01:00:13,809 --> 01:00:16,344
But right now,
we really need your help.

773
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:25,453
You need to tell us
where they are,

774
01:00:28,790 --> 01:00:30,724
what they want.

775
01:00:33,895 --> 01:00:35,896
If you tell us that,

776
01:00:38,434 --> 01:00:40,668
he's gonna
let you live.

777
01:00:44,039 --> 01:00:46,040
[Whispers]
No, he won't.

778
01:00:49,711 --> 01:00:53,297
[Anderson]
Well, then you're just gonna
have to trust me, aren't you?

779
01:00:53,365 --> 01:00:55,283
Just tell us everything,
Zoona.

780
01:00:57,436 --> 01:00:59,671
It's your choice.

781
01:00:59,738 --> 01:01:01,238
Okay.

782
01:01:02,708 --> 01:01:04,241
Okay.

783
01:01:05,410 --> 01:01:07,378
[Whispering]

784
01:01:09,848 --> 01:01:11,432
Thank you.

786
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:40,745

Open your mouth.

[Anderson]
Shh.

01:02:24,039 --> 01:02:26,457
Shh.

796
01:02:29,228 --> 01:02:30,794

[Zoona Screams,
Falls Silent]

800
01:03:23,064 --> 01:03:26,884
[Shiv]
Jax. Jax should know better
than to show up here again.

801
01:03:26,952 --> 01:03:28,819
Dirty scoundrel.

802
01:03:29,989 --> 01:03:31,756
Screwed me sideways.

803
01:03:31,824 --> 01:03:33,691
Spun me around
like a top.

804
01:03:33,758 --> 01:03:37,612
"Top of the hill!
That's where I belong!
Top of the hill!"

805
01:03:37,679 --> 01:03:40,381
[Chuckling]
We don't trust that guy.

806
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:42,132
We don't trust him
for one second.

807
01:03:42,200 --> 01:03:45,869
He's probably sitting right
outside that tent, waiting
for us to set foot out there,

808
01:03:45,937 --> 01:03:48,639
but that's not gonna happen
'cause we know him
better than that.

809
01:03:48,707 --> 01:03:51,091
Yes, sir. We know him
better than that.

810
01:03:51,159 --> 01:03:54,962
I'm gonna take him,
I'm gonna cut his nut sack open
in a circle...

811
01:03:55,030 --> 01:03:56,697
like a tin can
of boiled peanuts.

812

The only reason I'm here--
I just--

813
01:04:00,402 --> 01:04:02,403
I just need some help
with something.

814

[Unfolds Paper]

815
01:04:04,339 --> 01:04:06,273
I think it's
some sort of code.

816
01:04:09,778 --> 01:04:11,278
Yeah.

817
01:04:15,150 --> 01:04:16,617
Huh.

818
01:04:18,971 --> 01:04:22,056
Now, Jax, he told me
what you used to do.

819
01:04:22,124 --> 01:04:24,041
Huh? What'd he say?
What'd he say I did? Huh?

820
01:04:24,109 --> 01:04:26,644
The part about code breaking,
about you being a code breaker.

821
01:04:26,712 --> 01:04:29,847
Oh. Geez, I'm sorry.
I scared you, didn't I?

822
01:04:30,849 --> 01:04:33,167
So, how much?

823
01:04:33,234 --> 01:04:36,120
How much what?
The cost, to barter.
What's in it for me?

824
01:04:36,187 --> 01:04:38,122
See, Jimmy and I--
We don't know you from Adam.

825
01:04:38,190 --> 01:04:41,191
I knew a guy named Adam once,
and he was a prick.

826
01:04:41,259 --> 01:04:44,162
So, you want my help,
then you gotta
give me something.

827
01:04:44,229 --> 01:04:46,630
How 'bout your hands?
What?

828
01:04:46,699 --> 01:04:49,633
Your hands--
Cut 'em off, give 'em to me,
then I'll break your code.

829
01:04:49,702 --> 01:04:53,204
No, no, Shiv.
Look, I don't have anything
of value at all.

830
01:04:53,271 --> 01:04:56,007
But I'll give you
everything I have,
everything on me...

831
01:04:56,075 --> 01:04:58,509
if you can help me
find her, if she's--

I'll just take a finger.
No, no. Shiv.

01:05:07,403 --> 01:05:10,721
Hey. Don't be so nervous.
He's a nervous son of a bitch,
isn't he, Jimmy?

836
01:05:10,789 --> 01:05:13,591
What you got?
Let me see this there.

837
01:05:14,893 --> 01:05:16,694
Ah.

838
01:05:16,762 --> 01:05:18,596
You know what this is?

839
01:05:18,664 --> 01:05:21,448
Yeah, I have an idea.
Uh-huh.

01:05:21,517 --> 01:05:24,985
See? See this little
mark right there?

841
01:05:25,053 --> 01:05:27,087
This comes from

See, now somebody's
ass is grass.

01:05:34,195 --> 01:05:37,131
Different from
what I'm used to,
but I'll give it a crack.

845
01:05:37,198 --> 01:05:39,016
Yes, sirree, Bob.
I'll give it a crack.

846
01:05:39,084 --> 01:05:40,951
 A crack, la-la
I'll give it a crack 

847
01:05:41,019 --> 01:05:43,187
 A crack, a crack, a crack

01:05:45,224 --> 01:05:49,026
It's probably a--
probably the old book code here.

You know what books are,
don't you, Einstein?

850
01:05:51,497 --> 01:05:53,814
Huh?

851
01:05:53,882 --> 01:05:55,750
Huh?

01:05:55,818 --> 01:05:57,501
Okay.

853
01:05:57,568 --> 01:06:01,205
They pick a book,
they send in a breaker,
they pick the same book.

854
01:06:01,273 --> 01:06:04,408
To break a code,
you need a key.

855
01:06:04,476 --> 01:06:07,645
Now, a key is usually
a series of numbers...

856
01:06:07,712 --> 01:06:11,115
divided with a period,
or a letter,

857
01:06:11,183 --> 01:06:12,716
or whatever.

858
01:06:12,785 --> 01:06:16,087
Numbers are line numbers
on the page, then a word number
on that line.

859
01:06:16,155 --> 01:06:19,774
But the trick is--
the trick is finding
the right damn book...

860
01:06:19,841 --> 01:06:22,877
'cause it's gotta be
the same exact edition,

861
01:06:22,828 --> 01:06:24,912
same publisher,
same everything.

862
01:06:26,615 --> 01:06:28,782
Even one little period
out of place-- phh--

863
01:06:28,850 --> 01:06:30,734
throws the whole
damn thing off.

864
01:06:47,419 --> 01:06:50,104
[Sniffs, Exhales]

865
01:06:50,171 --> 01:06:52,573
I tell you what, Sherlock.

866
01:06:52,641 --> 01:06:55,309
I've looked at everything
from James Joyce to Playboy,

867
01:06:55,377 --> 01:06:58,212
and I can't
find a single word
in any one of 'em.

868
01:06:59,648 --> 01:07:03,850
So whatever
this, uh, code is,

869
01:07:03,918 --> 01:07:06,186
I can't find a damn key...

870
01:07:06,254 --> 01:07:08,689
if there's no lock
to open it from.

871
01:07:18,350 --> 01:07:20,484
Wait a minute.

872
01:07:55,337 --> 01:07:57,221
We got something here.

873
01:07:58,790 --> 01:08:00,624
Um--

874
01:08:04,746 --> 01:08:07,248
[Crickets Chirping]

875
01:08:13,955 --> 01:08:17,875
You know, this is
just the same thing...

876
01:08:17,943 --> 01:08:19,410
all over again.

877
01:08:19,478 --> 01:08:22,196
Don't talk!

878
01:08:22,264 --> 01:08:25,399
This is how we got here
in the first place.

879
01:08:25,467 --> 01:08:28,669
[Coughs]
Trusting blindly.

880
01:08:28,737 --> 01:08:31,922
[Breathing Heavily]
Turning our heads away
from the truth.

881
01:08:31,990 --> 01:08:33,924
I was chosen, okay?

882
01:08:35,127 --> 01:08:37,128
What was I supposed to do?

883
01:08:39,364 --> 01:08:41,999
I left a family
back there.

884
01:08:46,004 --> 01:08:48,172
Do you know what?

885
01:08:48,240 --> 01:08:51,041
The way I see it,

886
01:08:51,109 --> 01:08:52,876
I'm lucky...

887
01:08:55,230 --> 01:08:57,231
'cause I can have
a future now,

888
01:08:58,366 --> 01:09:00,200
a new beginning.

889
01:09:01,870 --> 01:09:03,871
I can have
a purpose again.

890
01:09:05,273 --> 01:09:07,941
I'm not just sitting,
waiting to die.

891
01:09:12,998 --> 01:09:15,232
You can't change
what happened,

892
01:09:17,702 --> 01:09:21,205
but you can change
the way we get it back.

893
01:09:27,829 --> 01:09:30,430
[Shiv]
Now, whoever wrote this code
didn't want it getting out.

894
01:09:33,969 --> 01:09:36,570
See, this is old
military code.

895
01:09:36,638 --> 01:09:38,806
I haven't seen it
since the great war.

896
01:09:40,925 --> 01:09:43,076
- But, uh--
- [Rustling]

897
01:09:45,079 --> 01:09:46,730
Shh.

898
01:09:46,798 --> 01:09:50,467
Now, see, now,
"fly" means exactly
what's implied.

899
01:09:50,535 --> 01:09:53,770
Means moving out
or transporting.

900
01:09:53,838 --> 01:09:56,507
And, uh, "shifter"--

901
01:09:56,575 --> 01:10:00,144
That's a military term
meaning guarded area.

902
01:10:00,211 --> 01:10:02,813
So that's what that means.

903
01:10:02,881 --> 01:10:06,283
And, uh-- What?

904
01:10:06,350 --> 01:10:09,553
Oh. You know what?
You might be
onto something.

905
01:10:09,620 --> 01:10:11,188
I think that--
Shiv!

906
01:10:11,255 --> 01:10:14,558
Shh!
Don't interrupt!

907
01:10:14,625 --> 01:10:16,860
God!

908
01:10:16,928 --> 01:10:18,595
I'll tell him.

909
01:10:18,663 --> 01:10:21,832
No, "haven" means, uh,
a place of refuge.

910
01:10:21,900 --> 01:10:25,669
Now, uh, that would be
transporting something
to a haven,

911
01:10:25,737 --> 01:10:27,905
a new capital...

912
01:10:27,972 --> 01:10:30,774
or, uh, a wonderful
land of O--

913
01:10:30,842 --> 01:10:34,144
Ah! You're off
to see the Wizard.

914
01:10:34,212 --> 01:10:37,848
Shiv, the Haven.
Now, where is it?
How do we get there?

915
01:10:37,916 --> 01:10:40,584
How do we get there?
How do we get there?

916
01:10:40,651 --> 01:10:42,853
Oh, my God.
How do we get there?

917
01:10:42,921 --> 01:10:44,772
We follow
the yellow brick road.

918
01:10:44,839 --> 01:10:47,842
We take the highway.
You drop me off
at the Waffle Palace.

919
01:10:47,909 --> 01:10:50,211
I get a quickie with Margie
in the back kitchen.

920
01:10:50,278 --> 01:10:52,512
How do we get there?
How do we get there?

921
01:10:54,082 --> 01:10:56,717
Shiv, please, just--

922
01:10:58,270 --> 01:11:00,204
Okay. Get there.

923
01:11:00,272 --> 01:11:03,473
Now, uh, "flick."

924
01:11:03,541 --> 01:11:06,076
Now, that's got me
second-guessing.

925
01:11:06,144 --> 01:11:07,878
Uh--

926
01:11:07,946 --> 01:11:11,165
That either means, uh,
it's an obscene gesture...

927
01:11:11,233 --> 01:11:15,002
or it means cure,
or recipe, or medicine.

928
01:11:15,070 --> 01:11:16,404
What?

929
01:11:16,471 --> 01:11:18,472
Oh, I think you're right.
Antidote.

930
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:20,541
Mr. M.I.T. over here.

931
01:11:22,110 --> 01:11:24,111
So what does it all mean?

932
01:11:26,415 --> 01:11:29,716
Well, um,
I'm only half a genius,

933
01:11:29,784 --> 01:11:31,952
but I'll tell you
what I think it means.

934
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:35,089
"Rufler" is, uh--
whatever "rhine" is--

935
01:11:35,156 --> 01:11:38,892
uh, transporting something
from the southernmost tip
to the Haven...

936
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,628
to create an antidote
for the pennies.

937
01:11:45,734 --> 01:11:48,401
Are we saying there's
a cure for the plague?

938
01:11:52,073 --> 01:11:54,141
Well, how am I
supposed to know?

939
01:11:54,209 --> 01:11:56,710
I still have two words
I haven't even figured out yet.

940
01:11:56,778 --> 01:11:58,678
The something.
"Cane" and "rhine."
What?

941
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:02,182
The something, the transport--
Could it be someone
instead of something?

942
01:12:02,334 --> 01:12:04,335
I was told
this Georgetown
is a camp.

943
01:12:04,402 --> 01:12:06,303
Could this list
be the transport?

944
01:12:06,371 --> 01:12:08,905
I always thought
that the antidote
was like a myth...

945
01:12:08,973 --> 01:12:11,775
to keep the underground quiet,
keep 'em from rebelling.

946
01:12:11,843 --> 01:12:15,278
But if it's true you found
an antidote, then I think
Jimmy and I deserve first--

947
01:12:15,347 --> 01:12:18,582
Just forget the antidote, okay?
There's a name on this list.

948
01:12:18,650 --> 01:12:22,452
All I care about is finding
that name. You've gotta tell me
the connection between the two.

949
01:12:22,521 --> 01:12:27,274
Uh, "cane" means a prisoner,
female prisoner.

950
01:12:27,341 --> 01:12:30,727
Transporting
the female prisoners then.
What does "rhine" mean?

951
01:12:30,795 --> 01:12:32,813
"Rhine" means
I don't give a flying nun.

952
01:12:32,881 --> 01:12:35,549
You have an antidote
for the apocalypse,
and all you care about--

953
01:12:35,617 --> 01:12:37,067
Listen to me!

954
01:12:37,135 --> 01:12:39,470
I don't care about
saving the world.

955
01:12:39,538 --> 01:12:42,473
I care about
saving my wife.

956
01:12:42,541 --> 01:12:44,525
Lunatic.
Got a cape?

957
01:12:46,828 --> 01:12:48,829
What?
Got yourself a cape?

958
01:12:50,064 --> 01:12:53,234
No, I don't have a cape.
Ah.

959
01:12:53,301 --> 01:12:56,570
Well, then you'd better
find yourself a phone booth
pretty damn quick,

960
01:12:56,638 --> 01:12:58,939
Mr. Clark Dense,

961
01:12:59,007 --> 01:13:02,075
because whatever Rufler's
province is losing here
in transport...

962
01:13:02,144 --> 01:13:03,810
must be
pretty damn valuable.

963
01:13:03,878 --> 01:13:05,546
And I'll tell you something.

964
01:13:05,614 --> 01:13:09,383
We'd better hope that
the Haven is a cartoon land,
super moron,

965
01:13:09,451 --> 01:13:11,685
because in the world
we live in,

966
01:13:11,753 --> 01:13:14,421
P.O.'s are the only one
with the speeding bullets.

967
01:13:14,489 --> 01:13:16,957
And if your wife
is indeed a prisoner,

968
01:13:17,025 --> 01:13:20,594
and she's part of this
transport, and the orders
haven't been carried out yet,

969
01:13:20,662 --> 01:13:24,765
you're gonna have
a hell of a time
getting past the front gate.

970
01:13:24,833 --> 01:13:27,768
[Clicks Tongue]
Hell of a time.

971
01:13:42,616 --> 01:13:44,051
Psst.

972
01:13:52,894 --> 01:13:55,195
What'd the code say?

973
01:13:55,263 --> 01:13:58,531
It said go straight,
southwest corner.
That's where we'll find her.

974
01:13:58,599 --> 01:14:00,734
Find who? Find who?

975
01:14:00,801 --> 01:14:02,802
Don't fuck with me, Jax.

976
01:14:04,405 --> 01:14:07,374
Do you have any idea
what it's like not to know?
Shh!

977
01:14:08,543 --> 01:14:10,944
I have to believe
it's her.

978
01:14:11,012 --> 01:14:13,347
All right.
And if there's even
a chance that it's her,

979
01:14:13,414 --> 01:14:15,782
nothing, especially you,
is gonna stop me.

980
01:14:15,850 --> 01:14:18,185
So get the fuck
out of my way.

01:14:18,253 --> 01:14:21,104
All right, all right.
Think about it.

982
01:14:21,172 --> 01:14:23,907
No, it's pitch black
out here.
Jax. Get out of my way.

983
01:14:23,975 --> 01:14:26,427
It's pitch black out here.
You won't know
which way is which.

984
01:14:26,494 --> 01:14:29,045
Just listen, listen,
listen, listen.

985
01:14:29,113 --> 01:14:32,015
I found a close place to stay.

986
01:14:32,082 --> 01:14:36,986
I say we get some rest,
head out in the morning.

987
01:14:42,777 --> 01:14:44,444
All right.

988
01:14:46,047 --> 01:14:47,314
Sure.

to understand,

to explain it to me.

Whatever decision
I make here, I mean,
you've gotta back me up.

Qualification two:
We're in this together.

01:34:43,277 --> 01:34:45,411
Keep that line tight!
[Shockley]
Yes, sir.

1192
01:35:02,563 --> 01:35:05,915
There's one gate to open.
The other province
will be here soon.

1193
01:35:05,983 --> 01:35:08,801
Grab a uniform.
I'll buy you some time
before you get out there.

1194
01:35:08,868 --> 01:35:11,186
But stay in here
until it's done.

1195
01:35:11,254 --> 01:35:13,605
You'll know
when to come out.

1196
01:35:24,585 --> 01:35:27,969
Gentlemen, good work.

1197
01:35:28,037 --> 01:35:30,055
All of them brought up
to this gate?

1198
01:35:30,123 --> 01:35:32,791
Yes, sir.
They're ready to move out.

1199
01:35:32,859 --> 01:35:35,928
The commander wants to debrief
everyone at the officers' camp
before we deploy.

1200
01:35:35,996 --> 01:35:38,447
[Woman Cries]
Yes, sir.

1201
01:35:44,020 --> 01:35:47,389
Just do it.
I've got the gate.

1202
01:36:03,406 --> 01:36:06,342
All right.
This is as far
as I can take you.

1203
01:36:06,410 --> 01:36:09,412
The officers were ordered
to load you up,

1204
01:36:09,479 --> 01:36:11,797
so you're just gonna
have to outrun 'em.

1205
01:36:11,949 --> 01:36:14,250
Godspeed.

1206
01:36:15,185 --> 01:36:16,969
[Woman Crying]

1207
01:36:17,036 --> 01:36:18,788
[Woman]
Let's go--
[Murmurs]

1208
01:36:20,089 --> 01:36:22,124
Oh, my God.

1209
01:36:25,161 --> 01:36:27,096
[Dog Barking]

1210
01:36:35,188 --> 01:36:37,889
[Door Hinges Squeaking]

1211
01:38:19,576 --> 01:38:21,677
They said there wasn't
a Katie Johnson.

1212
01:38:23,013 --> 01:38:25,781
I thought you were--
I thought--

1213
01:38:25,849 --> 01:38:29,018
Thought I lost you,
I took your last name.

1214
01:38:29,085 --> 01:38:31,587
[Laughs]
I took your last name.

1215
01:38:33,757 --> 01:38:35,374
[Gunshot]

1216
01:38:46,302 --> 01:38:48,153
There he is.

1217
01:38:49,589 --> 01:38:52,325
Myers! Take a team,
go get the rest.

1218
01:39:16,499 --> 01:39:17,949
[Rifle Cocks]
Oh, shit.

1219
01:39:18,017 --> 01:39:19,017
[Gunshot]

1220
01:39:23,824 --> 01:39:26,325
Just who do you think
you are anyway?

1221
01:39:32,748 --> 01:39:34,783
That's what I thought.

1222
01:39:34,851 --> 01:39:37,352
Shoot him.

1223
01:39:43,559 --> 01:39:46,228
Shoot him
in front of her.

1224
01:39:48,114 --> 01:39:50,783
Do it! Do it now!

1225
01:39:52,085 --> 01:39:53,485
[Grunts]
No!

1226
01:39:53,553 --> 01:39:55,370
No! Sean!

1227
01:39:55,438 --> 01:39:57,138
Sean!

1228
01:39:57,206 --> 01:40:01,076
[Crying]
Sean! Sean. God!

1229
01:40:02,445 --> 01:40:04,914
[Crying]

1230
01:40:04,981 --> 01:40:07,983
No!
[Crying Continues]

1231
01:40:13,890 --> 01:40:16,591
No! No.

1232
01:40:18,144 --> 01:40:20,278
[Crying Continues]

1233
01:40:34,794 --> 01:40:36,461
Who do I think I am?

1234
01:40:40,099 --> 01:40:41,600
Let her go.

1235
01:40:46,089 --> 01:40:47,389
Fire again!
No!

1236
01:40:47,457 --> 01:40:48,823
Fire!
No, we can't!

1237
01:40:48,859 --> 01:40:51,393
Raise your weapons,
you idiots!
We can't. We can't.

1238
01:40:51,460 --> 01:40:54,129
Don't you see?
Don't you understand?
[Gunshot]

1239
01:41:14,717 --> 01:41:17,569
All right.
You won't do it,
I will.

1240
01:41:21,808 --> 01:41:24,326
You're a steel,

1241
01:41:24,344 --> 01:41:26,061
but she's not.

1242
01:41:26,129 --> 01:41:27,896
[Gunshot]

1243
01:42:02,065 --> 01:42:03,298
[No Audible Dialogue]

1244
01:42:14,761 --> 01:42:16,428
[Exhales]

1245
01:42:51,164 --> 01:42:52,697
Thanks.

1246
01:42:55,385 --> 01:42:58,354
Red's leading his men
to the Haven.

1247
01:42:58,421 --> 01:43:01,423
The more I think about it,
there is a rebirth going on.

1248
01:43:02,992 --> 01:43:05,193
We should be there
to see it.

1249
01:43:06,463 --> 01:43:08,196
You should
come with us.

1250
01:43:09,766 --> 01:43:11,900
Wish I could, but...

1251
01:43:11,968 --> 01:43:13,635
after today,

1252
01:43:15,137 --> 01:43:17,639
I think I'm gonna have
my hands full for a while.

1253
01:43:21,711 --> 01:43:23,379
Good luck.
