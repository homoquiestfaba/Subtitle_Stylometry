1
00:00:14,614 --> 00:00:17,082
<i>- Now as you know,
the election results are in</i>

2
00:00:17,084 --> 00:00:19,084
<i>and as predicted,
senator Gary hubs</i>

3
00:00:19,086 --> 00:00:22,454
<i>is our new president elect.</i>

4
00:00:22,456 --> 00:00:26,291
<i>President hubs says that
the first thing on his agenda</i>

5
00:00:26,293 --> 00:00:29,728
<i>is going to be waging a new
war in the middle east.</i>

6
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:32,297
<i>And I have to admit that
maybe it's the right way to go.</i>

7
00:00:32,299 --> 00:00:36,101
<i>The threat of terrorism looms
larger than ever in America.</i>

8
00:00:36,103 --> 00:00:38,771
<i>In fact, this week,
homeland security</i>

9
00:00:38,773 --> 00:00:40,973
<i>updated the color-coded
warning system</i>

10
00:00:40,975 --> 00:00:44,076
<i>that the bush administration
created after 9/11.</i>

11
00:00:44,078 --> 00:00:47,112
<i>The old warning levels
were: Low.</i>

12
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:48,080
<i>Guarded.</i>

13
00:00:48,082 --> 00:00:49,148
<i>Elevated.</i>

14
00:00:49,150 --> 00:00:50,949
<i>High.</i>

15
00:00:50,951 --> 00:00:52,718
<i>And severe.</i>

16
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,455
<i>Now, the updated warning
levels are going to be:</i>

17
00:00:56,457 --> 00:00:57,723
<i>Be afraid.</i>

18
00:00:57,725 --> 00:00:59,224
<i>Be very afraid.</i>

19
00:00:59,226 --> 00:01:00,993
<i>Be freaking terrified.</i>

20
00:01:00,995 --> 00:01:02,428
<i>Shit's about to hit the fan.</i>

21
00:01:02,430 --> 00:01:04,663
<i>And you know what,
you're pretty much fucked.</i>

22
00:01:04,665 --> 00:01:07,433
<i>Anyway, enough of
this political nonsense,</i>

23
00:01:07,435 --> 00:01:09,268
<i>let's bring out
the fart machine.</i>

24
00:01:09,669 --> 00:01:11,770
<i>Yay!</i>

25
00:01:16,676 --> 00:01:18,577
- Oh man.

26
00:01:18,579 --> 00:01:21,580
- Why are you watching this?

27
00:01:21,582 --> 00:01:24,249
- I don't know.
It's funny.

28
00:01:24,251 --> 00:01:26,085
- Why are you drawing that?

29
00:01:28,221 --> 00:01:29,455
- I don't know.

30
00:01:29,457 --> 00:01:31,790
- I don't know either
but it worries me.

31
00:01:35,895 --> 00:01:37,763
Donna.

32
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:38,931
What are you doing?

33
00:01:38,933 --> 00:01:40,999
- Oh, I'm sorry Mrs. salt.

34
00:01:45,572 --> 00:01:48,140
- How many glasses
is that for you?

35
00:01:48,142 --> 00:01:48,874
- One.

36
00:01:48,876 --> 00:01:49,942
- Two.
- It's three.

37
00:01:49,944 --> 00:01:52,211
- Whatever.
Jesus drank wine.

38
00:01:52,213 --> 00:01:55,013
- Carl says we're this close
to landing a deal.

39
00:01:55,015 --> 00:01:56,448
Do you know what
that would mean?

40
00:01:56,450 --> 00:01:58,383
A government contract in
the middle east during a war?

41
00:01:58,385 --> 00:01:59,518
- That's great, honey.

42
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:01,153
Kip, eat your food.

43
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:05,324
- Well, I think
the war is wrong.

44
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:06,992
- Yeah? Well,
regardless of what you think,

45
00:02:06,994 --> 00:02:08,360
it's going to happen.

46
00:02:08,362 --> 00:02:10,696
And somebody's got to be
there to clean up the mess.

47
00:02:10,698 --> 00:02:13,799
And what is this?
What are you doing with this?

48
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:14,833
You've got to stop it with this.

49
00:02:14,835 --> 00:02:16,869
- I don't know why
he's doing that.

50
00:02:18,404 --> 00:02:19,638
- A deer?

51
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:32,985
- Sally.

52
00:02:35,088 --> 00:02:36,755
Hey, Sally.

53
00:02:36,757 --> 00:02:38,023
- Yeah?
- What are you doing?

54
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:39,491
- What are you doing?
- I'm taking a break.

55
00:02:39,493 --> 00:02:41,613
- Well, your break's over,
come over and look at this.

56
00:02:43,429 --> 00:02:45,497
Now, what do you think
of when you look at that?

57
00:02:46,432 --> 00:02:48,433
- The second world war?
- Really?

58
00:02:48,435 --> 00:02:50,402
- Why does it
make you think of that?

59
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:53,272
- It makes me think of the
worst thing I can imagine.

60
00:02:53,274 --> 00:02:55,607
And that would be the holocaust.

61
00:02:55,609 --> 00:02:57,843
- Isn't every war a holocaust?

62
00:02:57,845 --> 00:02:59,278
- Yeah, that's true.

63
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:01,547
- Do you want to see what I'm working on?
- No.

64
00:03:01,549 --> 00:03:03,849
- Do you think it
needs more red?

65
00:03:04,817 --> 00:03:07,553
- I think I read somewhere
that the color red

66
00:03:07,555 --> 00:03:11,623
evokes a sense of anxiety
in the spectator.

67
00:03:11,625 --> 00:03:13,959
- Yes, so?

68
00:03:13,961 --> 00:03:15,694
- So, if somebody
was going to buy this

69
00:03:15,696 --> 00:03:17,095
and hang it up on their wall,

70
00:03:17,097 --> 00:03:19,464
they might not be able to relax.

71
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,700
- So what,
painters shouldn't use red

72
00:03:21,702 --> 00:03:24,770
so the whole fucking world
can relax more?

73
00:03:24,772 --> 00:03:26,738
- Well, wouldn't the world
be a better place

74
00:03:26,740 --> 00:03:29,041
if we could all just relax?

75
00:03:29,043 --> 00:03:30,542
- Sally,

76
00:03:31,411 --> 00:03:33,812
get me another bottle of red.

77
00:03:43,223 --> 00:03:44,556
- Goodnight, kippie.

78
00:03:44,558 --> 00:03:46,158
- Goodnight, mom.

79
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:52,965
- Mmm, messy boy.

80
00:03:52,967 --> 00:03:54,499
Mess, mess, mess.

81
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:56,501
- Sorry.

82
00:04:00,440 --> 00:04:03,308
- Why do you have the need
to draw this stuff?

83
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,511
- It's fun.

84
00:04:06,513 --> 00:04:08,146
- Not really.

85
00:04:08,148 --> 00:04:10,148
Drawing is something
you do in kindergarten

86
00:04:10,150 --> 00:04:11,450
to get out of your system.

87
00:04:11,452 --> 00:04:13,752
You need to stop.

88
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:15,787
- Lots of people do it
for a living though.

89
00:04:15,789 --> 00:04:16,855
- Not really.

90
00:04:16,857 --> 00:04:18,690
Not if you want to be
taken seriously.

91
00:04:18,692 --> 00:04:20,993
Art isn't a real thing, kip.

92
00:04:20,995 --> 00:04:22,327
- What do you mean?

93
00:04:22,329 --> 00:04:24,196
- Well, I had a friend
in college who painted...

94
00:04:24,198 --> 00:04:25,097
- Was she good?

95
00:04:25,099 --> 00:04:26,832
- She thought she was.

96
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:29,468
God, she was so full of herself.

97
00:04:29,902 --> 00:04:32,004
- Maybe I could go
to art school some day.

98
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:35,674
- Well, I will support
whatever you want to do.

99
00:04:35,676 --> 00:04:37,342
As long as it means
going to Yale

100
00:04:37,344 --> 00:04:39,177
and studying in the
financial sector.

101
00:04:39,179 --> 00:04:40,345
- Goodnight, kip.

102
00:04:40,347 --> 00:04:41,346
- Goodnight, dad.

103
00:04:41,348 --> 00:04:42,381
- Come on, honey.
Let him sleep.

104
00:04:42,383 --> 00:04:44,650
He's too big to get tucked in.

105
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:48,320
- I'm not tucking him in.
I'm just hanging out.

106
00:04:48,322 --> 00:04:51,189
It's cool to hang out
with your mom, isn't it kip?

107
00:04:51,191 --> 00:04:52,691
- Sure.

108
00:04:53,960 --> 00:04:57,696
- Sweetheart, you can be
anything you want, okay?

109
00:04:57,698 --> 00:04:59,865
Just don't be, you know...

110
00:04:59,867 --> 00:05:00,832
This.

111
00:05:00,834 --> 00:05:02,567
- Let's go.

112
00:05:03,636 --> 00:05:05,237
- Oh my god.
You know what?

113
00:05:05,239 --> 00:05:07,506
I studied finance in college.

114
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:10,142
- Yeah well, you were
undecided until senior year,

115
00:05:10,144 --> 00:05:12,377
and then you dropped out.

116
00:05:12,379 --> 00:05:15,380
- Well, you give up
certain things to be a mother.

117
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:18,383
And being a mother
entitles you to some things,

118
00:05:18,385 --> 00:05:20,519
like hanging out with your son.

119
00:05:20,521 --> 00:05:22,020
- Let's go to bed.

120
00:05:22,022 --> 00:05:22,721
- Goodnight, mom.

121
00:05:22,723 --> 00:05:25,424
- Mmm, goodnight, honey.

122
00:05:28,628 --> 00:05:29,895
-<i> I need you.</i>

123
00:05:29,897 --> 00:05:31,163
- But it's humiliating.

124
00:05:31,165 --> 00:05:32,364
- Excuse me,

125
00:05:32,366 --> 00:05:33,665
- it pays the bills.
- Right.

126
00:05:33,667 --> 00:05:35,500
- It's the only thing
that pays the bills.

127
00:05:35,502 --> 00:05:36,868
- So, somebody has
to be the breadwinner.

128
00:05:36,870 --> 00:05:39,905
- Why is it always me?
- Because you're more masculine.

129
00:05:39,907 --> 00:05:41,540
- I'm not masculine.

130
00:05:41,542 --> 00:05:42,674
- I didn't say
you were masculine.

131
00:05:42,676 --> 00:05:43,909
I said you're more
masculine than I am.

132
00:05:43,911 --> 00:05:45,544
- How am I more
masculine than you?

133
00:05:45,546 --> 00:05:46,845
- Well, I mean, many ways.

134
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,114
But you like to strap on
the dildo all the time.

135
00:05:49,116 --> 00:05:50,749
- You are helping me tomorrow.

136
00:05:50,751 --> 00:05:51,850
- I'm not.
I can't.

137
00:05:51,852 --> 00:05:53,385
It's going to exhaust my brain.

138
00:05:53,387 --> 00:05:55,887
I can't break
my spirit like that.

139
00:05:55,889 --> 00:05:57,089
- I can't take it anymore.

140
00:05:57,091 --> 00:05:58,256
- Oh god.

141
00:05:58,258 --> 00:06:00,125
I'm working 12 hours
a day at the studio.

142
00:06:00,127 --> 00:06:01,593
It's going to pay off.

143
00:06:01,595 --> 00:06:03,528
You just have to just ride
it out with me a little bit.

144
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,896
- Ride it out? Really?
- Yeah. Yeah.

145
00:06:04,898 --> 00:06:06,131
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

146
00:06:06,133 --> 00:06:07,599
- You really think that
painting shit like this

147
00:06:07,601 --> 00:06:09,101
is going to pay off?

148
00:06:09,103 --> 00:06:12,404
- What the hell is this?
- What?

149
00:06:12,406 --> 00:06:13,605
- That painting?
- Yeah.

150
00:06:13,607 --> 00:06:16,074
- It's the cycle of life.

151
00:06:16,076 --> 00:06:17,409
- The cycle of life?

152
00:06:17,411 --> 00:06:19,711
- That's the end of the cycle.

153
00:06:22,915 --> 00:06:25,450
- What?
- I'm not happy.

154
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,486
- This isn't fair.

155
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:33,058
- Okay, okay.

156
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,993
Um...

157
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,395
This collector.

158
00:06:36,397 --> 00:06:37,829
He's coming to the
studio tomorrow.

159
00:06:37,831 --> 00:06:41,166
He's supposedly really rich
and he's, like, eccentric.

160
00:06:44,437 --> 00:06:45,771
- Are we still religious?

161
00:06:45,773 --> 00:06:47,639
- Not really.

162
00:06:47,641 --> 00:06:49,441
- Then why do we still pray?

163
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:51,176
- Just in case.

164
00:06:52,111 --> 00:06:54,246
- Are we going to war again
with the middle east?

165
00:06:54,248 --> 00:06:55,313
- Yes.

166
00:06:55,315 --> 00:06:56,515
- Why?

167
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:59,017
- Because they won't
do what we say.

168
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:02,254
Oh, I'm sorry, Mrs. salt.

169
00:07:02,256 --> 00:07:04,156
- No, don't apologize.

170
00:07:04,158 --> 00:07:05,924
You're right.

171
00:07:07,527 --> 00:07:10,162
Sweetheart, if someone
bigger and better than you

172
00:07:10,164 --> 00:07:12,330
tells you to do
something, do it.

173
00:07:12,332 --> 00:07:13,799
- Why?

174
00:07:13,801 --> 00:07:15,500
- Because their knowledge
is what made them

175
00:07:15,502 --> 00:07:16,868
bigger and better.

176
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:19,504
- Yeah, how's that for
a freaking birthday present.

177
00:07:19,506 --> 00:07:22,441
It was a very encouraging
email, don't you think?

178
00:07:22,443 --> 00:07:25,110
Yeah, you bet your
sticky sweet ass.

179
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:28,346
Okay, I'll see you
tonight, buddy.

180
00:07:29,650 --> 00:07:31,850
Good morning.

181
00:07:31,852 --> 00:07:35,120
It's a beautiful, beautiful day.

182
00:07:35,122 --> 00:07:37,155
- A beautiful, beautiful day.

183
00:07:37,157 --> 00:07:38,356
- You're in a good mood.

184
00:07:38,358 --> 00:07:40,692
- Well, we just got
a very encouraging email

185
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,360
from Phil price at the Pentagon.

186
00:07:42,362 --> 00:07:44,996
He's the head of the committee
for defense contractors.

187
00:07:44,998 --> 00:07:46,398
- Oh, that sounds promising.

188
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:47,666
- Can you imagine

189
00:07:47,668 --> 00:07:49,634
if we land this contract
tonight of all nights?

190
00:07:49,636 --> 00:07:51,536
- Karl's birthday?
Wouldn't that be great?

191
00:07:51,538 --> 00:07:53,038
- That would be great.

192
00:07:53,040 --> 00:07:54,706
- I'm am praying this
deal goes through.

193
00:07:54,708 --> 00:07:55,907
Praying.

194
00:07:55,909 --> 00:07:58,043
Oh Jesus.
Donna?

195
00:07:58,045 --> 00:07:59,544
- Oh, I've got it Mr. salt.

196
00:07:59,546 --> 00:08:01,379
- Oh, I'm sorry.
Thank you.

197
00:08:01,381 --> 00:08:03,381
I'm just such a klutz.
Jesus.

198
00:08:03,383 --> 00:08:05,250
- Not a problem.

199
00:08:05,318 --> 00:08:07,385
<i>- It's so shocking, your work.</i>

200
00:08:07,387 --> 00:08:10,021
- Oh, you meant that
as a compliment.

201
00:08:10,023 --> 00:08:12,657
- It's positively vulgar.

202
00:08:13,159 --> 00:08:14,326
But in a good way.

203
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,328
- Oh, thanks.

204
00:08:16,330 --> 00:08:20,165
- I do think most of us
are in some sort of stupor.

205
00:08:20,167 --> 00:08:23,201
Clueless consumers
with lobotomies.

206
00:08:23,203 --> 00:08:27,038
- Yeah, consumerism
is a big part of my work.

207
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:29,741
- You've heard of black Friday.
- Of course.

208
00:08:29,743 --> 00:08:31,243
- You've seen the videos

209
00:08:31,245 --> 00:08:34,579
of people storming the stores
like rabid cattle.

210
00:08:34,581 --> 00:08:37,682
- Yeah, right.
Like rabid cattle.

211
00:08:38,618 --> 00:08:40,519
- But this work.

212
00:08:40,521 --> 00:08:43,755
This work seems to say.

213
00:08:43,757 --> 00:08:44,923
Wake up!

214
00:08:44,925 --> 00:08:46,258
- Right.

215
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:49,394
That's my hope.
To wake people up.

216
00:08:49,396 --> 00:08:51,429
- Very interesting.

217
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:55,600
Of course, I could never
hang any of this on my wall.

218
00:08:55,602 --> 00:08:57,602
My wife would never allow it.

219
00:08:57,604 --> 00:09:00,405
- Maybe you should show your
wife who wears the pants.

220
00:09:00,407 --> 00:09:02,374
- Ashley, be reasonable.

221
00:09:02,376 --> 00:09:04,876
This is the kind of work
that could drive someone mad.

222
00:09:04,878 --> 00:09:06,945
- What?
Because of the red?

223
00:09:06,947 --> 00:09:10,148
Come on, I do other paintings.
I could use yellow.

224
00:09:10,150 --> 00:09:11,950
- It's not...
It's not the red.

225
00:09:11,952 --> 00:09:15,453
It's the subject matter.
It's insane.

226
00:09:15,455 --> 00:09:17,455
- Isn't our state
of unawareness insane?

227
00:09:17,457 --> 00:09:20,992
Don't we need insanity to pull
us out of our current insanity?

228
00:09:20,994 --> 00:09:24,162
- Oh, this is interesting.

229
00:09:24,730 --> 00:09:27,098
What is this?

230
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:28,500
Excuse me.

231
00:09:28,502 --> 00:09:30,402
- Oh, yeah.

232
00:09:30,404 --> 00:09:33,572
- Uh, do you draw these bunnies?

233
00:09:33,574 --> 00:09:35,273
- Oh, yeah.

234
00:09:35,275 --> 00:09:38,510
- Why do you express
yourself in this way?

235
00:09:38,512 --> 00:09:39,911
- What are you talking about?

236
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,513
- Well, these blue bunnies.

237
00:09:41,515 --> 00:09:45,850
They're so Sincere,
and so hopeful.

238
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:48,820
- Oh, um, bunnies are cute.

239
00:09:48,822 --> 00:09:53,825
Um, and they're sexual
but unthreatening.

240
00:09:54,260 --> 00:09:55,860
- Don't drink tonight.

241
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,862
- That's a strange request.

242
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:00,365
- Well, it's not a request.
Just don't drink tonight.

243
00:10:00,367 --> 00:10:01,533
- What do you mean?
It's a party.

244
00:10:01,535 --> 00:10:02,634
You're supposed to
drink at these things.

245
00:10:02,636 --> 00:10:03,835
- This is an important night.

246
00:10:03,837 --> 00:10:06,338
I don't want you
to embarrass me.

247
00:10:06,340 --> 00:10:07,672
- What do you mean?

248
00:10:07,674 --> 00:10:09,841
- You know what I mean.

249
00:10:09,843 --> 00:10:11,543
- No, but you're implying
that I'm embarrassing

250
00:10:11,545 --> 00:10:13,445
- when I drink.
- Yeah.

251
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:17,882
- Stanley.
Do I embarrass you?

252
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:19,217
- When you drink too much,
Veronica,

253
00:10:19,219 --> 00:10:21,820
yes, you embarrass me.

254
00:10:21,822 --> 00:10:23,488
- Why are you
telling me this now?

255
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,556
I thought you
liked it when I drink.

256
00:10:24,558 --> 00:10:26,691
- Why would I like it
when you drink?

257
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:29,361
- Come on.
A party without alcohol.

258
00:10:29,363 --> 00:10:30,462
It might as well be aa.

259
00:10:30,464 --> 00:10:31,529
- Maybe you should go home.

260
00:10:31,531 --> 00:10:33,999
- Okay Stanley,
what is your problem?

261
00:10:35,801 --> 00:10:37,502
- You're on very
thin ice right now,

262
00:10:37,504 --> 00:10:39,838
and it cracks every time
you put a glass of wine

263
00:10:39,840 --> 00:10:41,373
down your throat.

264
00:10:41,375 --> 00:10:42,741
- What is that supposed to mean?
- What do you think it means?

265
00:10:42,743 --> 00:10:44,509
- I have no idea.
You never speak in metaphors.

266
00:10:44,511 --> 00:10:47,512
- Just go home
and I'll tell Karl

267
00:10:47,514 --> 00:10:50,181
that you got sick or something.

268
00:10:50,183 --> 00:10:52,217
- But I'm not sick.

269
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:56,721
- Stanley, are you unhappy?
- Oh.

270
00:10:58,624 --> 00:10:59,658
- Stanley, answer the question.

271
00:10:59,660 --> 00:11:02,560
- Look at me.
Do I look happy?

272
00:11:04,096 --> 00:11:05,196
- Maybe you're
happy on the inside?

273
00:11:05,198 --> 00:11:07,866
- I am not happy, Veronica.

274
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:22,180
- Babe,

275
00:11:22,182 --> 00:11:23,848
what are you doing?

276
00:11:23,850 --> 00:11:25,684
Just stuffing your face?

277
00:11:25,686 --> 00:11:28,119
Babe, I need your help.
Please, take this.

278
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:30,188
- I love you. Go.
- I'm sorry.

279
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,890
- Stop it.

280
00:11:32,858 --> 00:11:35,360
You made a mess in here.

281
00:11:35,362 --> 00:11:37,095
- You want one?

282
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,596
- What are you doing?
- I'm sorry.

283
00:11:38,598 --> 00:11:39,931
- Go.

284
00:11:43,035 --> 00:11:44,235
- It's that much.

285
00:11:44,237 --> 00:11:45,637
Let it be bigger.
The more the merrier.

286
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:47,238
The bigger the war, the better,
as far as I'm concerned.

287
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:48,540
- You're going to
need more employees.

288
00:11:48,542 --> 00:11:49,941
- Well, that's the
understatement of the year.

289
00:11:49,943 --> 00:11:51,109
- You'll just hire
the locals, right?

290
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:51,910
- I can do whatever
the hell I want.

291
00:11:51,912 --> 00:11:52,911
I'm captain of the ship.

292
00:11:52,913 --> 00:11:54,079
More. Less.
It doesn't matter.

293
00:11:54,081 --> 00:11:55,647
- That makes sense.

294
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:56,748
- I'm just glad that
the wealthy democrats

295
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:58,083
are finally coming around.

296
00:11:58,085 --> 00:11:59,317
- Oh, come on.

297
00:11:59,319 --> 00:12:00,819
There's no such thing
as wealthy democrats.

298
00:12:00,821 --> 00:12:03,088
This culture was
built on the backs

299
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:04,989
of hard-working entrepreneurs.

300
00:12:04,991 --> 00:12:06,291
- There he is, the birthday boy.

301
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:08,560
- Oh, I love him!

302
00:12:08,562 --> 00:12:10,595
- How are you?
You look great!

303
00:12:10,597 --> 00:12:11,730
- So do you.
My god.

304
00:12:11,732 --> 00:12:12,897
That's beautiful.
How are you?

305
00:12:12,899 --> 00:12:14,265
- I'm really really good.

306
00:12:14,267 --> 00:12:16,301
- It's silky. It's silky.

307
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,338
- I'm not...
I'm not good at this.

308
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:21,906
I think I should
get out of here.

309
00:12:21,908 --> 00:12:23,908
Forget the
decapitated heads and shit.

310
00:12:23,910 --> 00:12:25,610
I'll do flowers.
I'll paint flowers.

311
00:12:25,612 --> 00:12:26,578
- I'll get us money.
- Baby.

312
00:12:26,580 --> 00:12:27,946
- I can get us money.
- Baby.

313
00:12:27,948 --> 00:12:30,181
- Just stand behind the bar
and serve drinks, okay?

314
00:12:30,183 --> 00:12:32,150
Everything's
going to be alright.

315
00:12:33,352 --> 00:12:34,285
- Serve some drinks.

316
00:12:34,287 --> 00:12:35,420
- So, how's kip?

317
00:12:35,422 --> 00:12:36,654
- Oh, he's great.

318
00:12:36,656 --> 00:12:37,989
- He's wonderful.
- May I offer you a drink?

319
00:12:37,991 --> 00:12:41,192
- Oh, um... I'm fine.
Thank you.

320
00:12:41,194 --> 00:12:42,527
- Are you sure?

321
00:12:42,529 --> 00:12:44,963
- What is that actually?
Is it a cab?

322
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:57,709
- More champagne.

323
00:12:59,111 --> 00:13:00,478
Cheers.

324
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,050
Ugh.

325
00:13:07,286 --> 00:13:09,154
Spit this out.

326
00:13:10,055 --> 00:13:12,190
- I need another one of these.

327
00:13:13,425 --> 00:13:15,660
- Um... yeah, red.
- Yeah.

328
00:13:15,662 --> 00:13:18,062
- Jesus, you look like
someone I went to college with.

329
00:13:18,064 --> 00:13:20,064
- Lucky you.

330
00:13:20,066 --> 00:13:22,400
- Jesus, you look just like her.

331
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:30,241
- Hi, Veronica.

332
00:13:30,243 --> 00:13:32,710
- Oh my freaking god.
Ashley?

333
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:36,681
Oh my god!

334
00:13:37,917 --> 00:13:40,552
Holy shit, I can't believe it.

335
00:13:41,086 --> 00:13:43,254
Wow.

336
00:13:43,256 --> 00:13:45,723
What have you been up to?

337
00:13:45,725 --> 00:13:48,092
I mean, besides this?

338
00:13:49,094 --> 00:13:50,094
- Oh this?

339
00:13:50,096 --> 00:13:52,864
Yeah, I'm helping out a friend.

340
00:13:52,866 --> 00:13:54,699
- No, of course.
I wasn't judging you.

341
00:13:54,701 --> 00:13:55,867
- No, no.
I know.

342
00:13:55,869 --> 00:13:58,002
- I mean, I waited tables
once for a week.

343
00:13:58,004 --> 00:13:59,037
Maybe it was a day.

344
00:13:59,039 --> 00:14:01,506
Wait, no...

345
00:14:01,508 --> 00:14:02,540
I didn't.

346
00:14:02,542 --> 00:14:06,778
Um, are you...
Are you in New York?

347
00:14:06,780 --> 00:14:08,746
- Yep.

348
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:11,282
- I had no idea.
I've never seen you.

349
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:12,450
So, where are you?

350
00:14:12,452 --> 00:14:14,752
- Um, bushwick.

351
00:14:15,154 --> 00:14:17,055
- Oh.

352
00:14:17,057 --> 00:14:18,756
Bushwick.

353
00:14:18,758 --> 00:14:20,758
Of course.

354
00:14:21,794 --> 00:14:25,530
Um, we have
an apartment in soho.

355
00:14:25,532 --> 00:14:27,732
And a little place
in the Hamptons.

356
00:14:27,734 --> 00:14:29,534
- Mmm, cool.

357
00:14:29,536 --> 00:14:30,768
- Mmm.

358
00:14:30,770 --> 00:14:32,370
Oh my god, this is so crazy.

359
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,405
This is my husband's party.

360
00:14:34,407 --> 00:14:35,807
- Oh yeah?
- Yeah, yeah.

361
00:14:35,809 --> 00:14:38,710
- He's over there with his
big shot business partner.

362
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:42,280
They're like, uh, gonna
close a really big account.

363
00:14:42,282 --> 00:14:43,481
- Oh, cool.

364
00:14:43,483 --> 00:14:45,283
That's cool.
Which one is he?

365
00:14:45,384 --> 00:14:46,718
- Uh, he's, uh...

366
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:49,921
- Oh, see those two guys by the couch?
- Yeah.

367
00:14:49,923 --> 00:14:51,890
- He's the tall handsome one.

368
00:14:53,058 --> 00:14:54,425
- For real?
- Mm-hmm.

369
00:14:54,427 --> 00:14:57,328
- Wow.
I thought those guys were gay.

370
00:14:57,330 --> 00:14:58,830
They were acting so gay.

371
00:14:58,832 --> 00:15:00,565
Like gay, gay, gay, gay.

372
00:15:00,567 --> 00:15:02,267
- They were like...

373
00:15:02,269 --> 00:15:04,102
- Why would you think that?
- No, nothing, I kidding.

374
00:15:04,104 --> 00:15:05,303
- Don't...
He's great.

375
00:15:05,305 --> 00:15:06,838
He's so lovely.

376
00:15:06,840 --> 00:15:08,273
- Yeah, my husband's not gay.

377
00:15:08,275 --> 00:15:10,508
- We have a son. A beautiful son.
- No, I know.

378
00:15:10,510 --> 00:15:11,809
- Don't get offended.

379
00:15:11,811 --> 00:15:15,947
Honestly, it was a joke.
He's really... handsome.

380
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,982
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Mm-hmm.

381
00:15:19,451 --> 00:15:22,153
- So, what about you?
Are you married?

382
00:15:24,523 --> 00:15:26,090
Oh no. Wait. Yes.
You're right.

383
00:15:26,092 --> 00:15:28,626
Because you're gay, right?

384
00:15:28,628 --> 00:15:30,995
- Yeah, you remembered, huh?

385
00:15:30,997 --> 00:15:32,664
- Of course, I remembered.

386
00:15:33,432 --> 00:15:35,934
That's when...

387
00:15:35,936 --> 00:15:38,036
I stopped hanging out with you.

388
00:15:38,038 --> 00:15:40,805
- Oh really?

389
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:43,207
I... I...

390
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:44,342
You know.

391
00:15:44,344 --> 00:15:45,877
I pretty much remembered

392
00:15:45,879 --> 00:15:47,712
that I stopped
hanging out with you.

393
00:15:47,714 --> 00:15:48,980
- You know what...

394
00:15:48,982 --> 00:15:51,182
Okay, hold on a second.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

395
00:15:51,184 --> 00:15:52,617
I didn't stop
hanging out with you

396
00:15:52,619 --> 00:15:53,685
because you were gay.

397
00:15:53,687 --> 00:15:55,987
- Oh my god.
- It's just, it's just,

398
00:15:57,456 --> 00:16:01,392
I had to, you know,
make that call.

399
00:16:02,461 --> 00:16:03,795
Anyway.

400
00:16:03,797 --> 00:16:04,996
What is your story now?

401
00:16:04,998 --> 00:16:07,532
Are you still doing
that art thing you do?

402
00:16:08,500 --> 00:16:10,401
- The art thing?

403
00:16:10,403 --> 00:16:11,903
Yeah, Veronica,

404
00:16:11,905 --> 00:16:13,237
- I'm still doing the art thing.
- Yeah, the painting thing?

405
00:16:13,239 --> 00:16:15,473
- Yeah, that painting thing.
I still do it. Yeah.

406
00:16:15,475 --> 00:16:16,574
- Really,
you stayed with it, huh?

407
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:19,177
- I stayed with it?

408
00:16:19,179 --> 00:16:22,146
You don't just stay with it.
It's your life commitment.

409
00:16:22,148 --> 00:16:23,548
What am I talking
about this for?

410
00:16:23,550 --> 00:16:25,049
I can't even believe it.

411
00:16:25,051 --> 00:16:27,819
- My son, he wants
to be an artist.

412
00:16:27,821 --> 00:16:30,822
Oh god, I'm trying to
talk him out of it.

413
00:16:30,824 --> 00:16:33,691
- And why would you do that?

414
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:37,562
- Why do you think?

415
00:16:37,997 --> 00:16:39,564
<i>- Hey everybody, everybody.</i>

416
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:40,865
<i>Listen up.</i>

417
00:16:40,867 --> 00:16:42,400
<i>Listen up. Listen up.
I know we're here...</i>

418
00:16:42,402 --> 00:16:44,836
- Oh, that's good news.
<i>- To celebrate Karl's birthday.</i>

419
00:16:44,838 --> 00:16:48,339
- But what better gift
than to announce that we,

420
00:16:48,341 --> 00:16:51,509
us, our company will be handling

421
00:16:51,511 --> 00:16:53,845
all the debris disposal

422
00:16:53,847 --> 00:16:57,682
throughout the middle east
construction faze of this war.

423
00:16:57,684 --> 00:16:59,717
Raise a glass to trash.

424
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:16,234
- Hey.
- Oh, my trash man.

425
00:17:16,236 --> 00:17:17,869
- Oh, you're making us rich,
huh?

426
00:17:17,871 --> 00:17:19,570
You're making us rich.

427
00:17:19,572 --> 00:17:21,039
- Veronica, you're drunk.

428
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:22,774
- Oh. No, babe.
I'm totally not.

429
00:17:22,776 --> 00:17:24,375
- You're hammered.
- I'm totally fine.

430
00:17:24,377 --> 00:17:26,044
- And I asked you not to drink.

431
00:17:26,046 --> 00:17:27,945
You need to go home.

432
00:17:27,947 --> 00:17:29,814
- Now.
- What?

433
00:17:31,884 --> 00:17:32,817
- I'll see you at home.

434
00:17:32,819 --> 00:17:35,053
Just... just go home.
Okay?

435
00:17:35,055 --> 00:17:36,721
- Okay.

436
00:17:39,091 --> 00:17:41,392
- You are going to be very busy.

437
00:17:56,708 --> 00:17:59,277
- God, watch it.
- You watch it.

438
00:17:59,279 --> 00:18:01,245
- What are you doing?
- What the fuck are you doing?

439
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:03,147
- Why are you standing in the
middle of the fucking stairwell?

440
00:18:03,149 --> 00:18:04,649
- I'm just standing here.

441
00:18:04,651 --> 00:18:06,984
- Oh my god.
Are you smoking pot?

442
00:18:06,986 --> 00:18:08,019
Oh, you're pathetic.

443
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:09,787
- Oh my god.
- Oh, you're pathetic.

444
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,255
- What are you?

445
00:18:11,257 --> 00:18:13,091
You're a fucking
caterer, Ashley.

446
00:18:13,093 --> 00:18:15,293
- You're a fucking
trophy wife, Veronica.

447
00:18:15,295 --> 00:18:17,161
- I am a mother.

448
00:18:17,163 --> 00:18:19,497
- Oh man, I feel sorry
for your fucking kid.

449
00:18:19,499 --> 00:18:20,865
Oh!

450
00:18:20,867 --> 00:18:22,834
Oh my god!

451
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,840
Oh my god.

452
00:18:38,884 --> 00:18:40,485
- Ow.

453
00:19:14,286 --> 00:19:17,054
Don't touch me.

454
00:21:10,402 --> 00:21:15,506
- <i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

455
00:21:15,508 --> 00:21:20,778
<i>Happy birthday to you.</i>

456
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:27,351
<i>Happy birthday, dear Karl.</i>

457
00:21:27,353 --> 00:21:33,024
<i>Happy birthday, to you.</i>

458
00:21:57,516 --> 00:21:59,817
<i>- We're approaching
the two year anniversary</i>

459
00:21:59,819 --> 00:22:02,320
<i>of the new war
in the middle east.</i>

460
00:22:02,322 --> 00:22:03,888
<i>It seemed to be
going well, at first.</i>

461
00:22:03,890 --> 00:22:07,992
<i>Then, the president did
something nobody saw coming.</i>

462
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:09,827
<i>He reinstated the draft.</i>

463
00:22:09,829 --> 00:22:12,096
<i>I know, I know, I know.</i>

464
00:22:12,098 --> 00:22:14,832
<i>Very, very unpopular
move at first.</i>

465
00:22:14,834 --> 00:22:17,234
<i>But as the president predicted,</i>

466
00:22:17,236 --> 00:22:20,404
<i>the draft is having a positive
affect on the economy.</i>

467
00:22:20,406 --> 00:22:22,239
<i>In fact,
the president's poll numbers</i>

468
00:22:22,241 --> 00:22:26,177
<i>are actually surging in parts
of the south and midwest.</i>

469
00:22:26,179 --> 00:22:28,512
<i>Well, that's what happens when
you force blacks and latinos</i>

470
00:22:28,514 --> 00:22:29,747
<i>to leave the country.</i>

471
00:22:29,749 --> 00:22:31,349
<i>The hillbillies just love you.</i>

472
00:22:32,785 --> 00:22:36,087
<i>Anyway, anyway, enough
of this political nonsense.</i>

473
00:22:36,089 --> 00:22:38,589
<i>Let's bring out
the fart machine.</i>

474
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,277
- Oh!
Oh my.

475
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:02,246
Oh, Mrs. salt?

476
00:23:02,248 --> 00:23:03,581
You're awake?

477
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:04,749
Oh.

478
00:23:04,751 --> 00:23:05,983
Doctor!

479
00:23:06,551 --> 00:23:08,285
Doctor!
We need a doctor!

480
00:23:08,387 --> 00:23:09,820
- My name is doctor Jones

481
00:23:09,822 --> 00:23:12,890
and I'm the comatose doctor
at mercy general.

482
00:23:12,892 --> 00:23:14,458
- The comatose doctor?

483
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:17,595
- Yes, I specialize in comatose
patients here at the hospital.

484
00:23:17,597 --> 00:23:19,163
- Okay.

485
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:22,166
- I know this is going to come
as a bit of a shock, Mrs. salt,

486
00:23:22,168 --> 00:23:26,070
but you've been in
a coma for two years.

487
00:23:26,072 --> 00:23:27,171
- What?

488
00:23:27,173 --> 00:23:28,973
- You've been in
a coma for two years.

489
00:23:28,975 --> 00:23:31,308
- I know, I heard
you the first time,

490
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,010
but... what?

491
00:23:33,012 --> 00:23:36,647
- You've suffered a massive
brain injury and frankly,

492
00:23:36,649 --> 00:23:38,816
we didn't think you were
going to come out of it.

493
00:23:38,818 --> 00:23:41,619
But I'm happy that you regained
consciousness when you did.

494
00:23:41,621 --> 00:23:44,855
We've been unable to withdraw
funds from your bank,

495
00:23:44,857 --> 00:23:48,292
actually, and we were in
the process of moving you

496
00:23:48,294 --> 00:23:49,360
to another facility.

497
00:23:49,362 --> 00:23:51,028
- But I have health insurance.

498
00:23:51,030 --> 00:23:54,265
- Actually, you had a
government-issued health policy

499
00:23:54,267 --> 00:23:56,167
and those were
discontinued last year.

500
00:23:56,169 --> 00:23:57,368
We've been pulling funds

501
00:23:57,370 --> 00:23:59,203
directly from your
savings account.

502
00:23:59,205 --> 00:24:00,538
- But that doesn't
make any sense.

503
00:24:00,540 --> 00:24:02,540
My family is rich.

504
00:24:02,542 --> 00:24:05,676
There should be plenty
of funds to pull from.

505
00:24:05,678 --> 00:24:07,511
- Mrs. salt.

506
00:24:07,513 --> 00:24:09,847
I have some bad news.

507
00:24:15,086 --> 00:24:17,555
- Mr. salt is dead.

508
00:24:17,557 --> 00:24:19,323
- Wha-uh, what?

509
00:24:19,325 --> 00:24:20,224
How?

510
00:24:20,226 --> 00:24:22,293
- A terrible accident.

511
00:24:24,095 --> 00:24:25,896
- Where's kip?

512
00:24:25,898 --> 00:24:27,832
Oh.
I need to see my son.

513
00:24:27,834 --> 00:24:30,134
Where's kippy?

514
00:24:30,136 --> 00:24:34,171
- Mrs. salt, I don't know how
to tell you this. - What?

515
00:24:34,173 --> 00:24:36,674
- Your son is dead, too.

516
00:24:38,076 --> 00:24:40,911
- What?

517
00:24:40,913 --> 00:24:43,047
Are you joking?

518
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:45,649
What?
This can't be happening.

519
00:24:45,651 --> 00:24:49,920
- This is a... what is going on?
- It's okay. It's okay.

520
00:24:49,922 --> 00:24:52,756
- What is...
This is a nightmare.

521
00:24:52,758 --> 00:24:55,426
- I'll go get her a sedative.
- Can you get me one, too?

522
00:24:55,428 --> 00:24:57,828
- I need one as well.
I'll be right back.

523
00:24:57,830 --> 00:24:59,730
- This isn't happening.
This can't be happening.

524
00:24:59,732 --> 00:25:01,198
- Yeah, but it is.
- No, it's not.

525
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,767
- I'm sorry, Mrs. salt.
I'm so sorry.

526
00:25:03,769 --> 00:25:06,370
- Wait.
My son is dead?

527
00:25:06,372 --> 00:25:08,072
- Yes.
- How?

528
00:25:08,074 --> 00:25:09,840
- He died in the war.

529
00:25:09,842 --> 00:25:13,010
- The war.
My son died in the war.

530
00:25:13,012 --> 00:25:15,045
How long have I
been asleep again?

531
00:25:15,047 --> 00:25:17,681
- Two years.
- Two years.

532
00:25:17,683 --> 00:25:20,017
That means that...
Kip is only 17,

533
00:25:20,019 --> 00:25:22,119
he's too young
to serve in the military.

534
00:25:22,121 --> 00:25:25,222
- They lowered the age
to serve to 16.

535
00:25:25,224 --> 00:25:27,291
- My own son was drafted.
- What?

536
00:25:27,293 --> 00:25:28,893
- How can they do that?

537
00:25:28,895 --> 00:25:30,794
- It was something
the congress decided.

538
00:25:30,796 --> 00:25:32,396
They said if you're
old enough to drive,

539
00:25:32,398 --> 00:25:33,898
you're old enough to kill.

540
00:25:33,900 --> 00:25:35,799
- How old is the
drinking age then?

541
00:25:35,801 --> 00:25:37,902
- It's still 21.
- Uh.

542
00:25:37,904 --> 00:25:41,138
- This must be so much
of a shock to you.

543
00:25:41,140 --> 00:25:42,273
I'm sorry. You...

544
00:25:42,275 --> 00:25:45,242
No family, no home,
and you're broke.

545
00:25:45,244 --> 00:25:47,945
But you're awake.
And you look great.

546
00:25:47,947 --> 00:25:50,981
- What do you mean, I'm broke?

547
00:25:50,983 --> 00:25:52,650
- It's all gone.

548
00:25:52,652 --> 00:25:55,319
Didn't you hear the doctor?

549
00:25:55,321 --> 00:25:58,556
They used all your assets
to pay for the hospital.

550
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:03,294
- I don't understand.

551
00:26:03,296 --> 00:26:05,663
I don't have anything?

552
00:26:05,665 --> 00:26:08,999
- Oh, I have a small box
of your belongings.

553
00:26:09,001 --> 00:26:11,268
I saved them for you.

554
00:26:19,611 --> 00:26:21,245
- Oh my god, Donna.

555
00:26:21,247 --> 00:26:23,581
Oh my god, Donna.
Hold my hand, please.

556
00:26:23,583 --> 00:26:25,015
Oh Donna, hold my hand.

557
00:26:25,017 --> 00:26:26,417
What am I going to do?

558
00:26:26,419 --> 00:26:29,019
Oh my god, Donna.
What am I going to do?

559
00:26:29,421 --> 00:26:31,021
I can't tell you
what it means to me.

560
00:26:31,023 --> 00:26:36,026
I'm so grateful that you've
been by my side this whole time.

561
00:26:36,028 --> 00:26:39,029
- Well, that's not quite true.

562
00:26:39,031 --> 00:26:42,132
I - I work for the hospital.

563
00:26:42,134 --> 00:26:44,702
They hired me last week.

564
00:26:44,704 --> 00:26:46,937
I clean the rooms.

565
00:27:05,957 --> 00:27:07,891
- How much is this one?

566
00:27:08,727 --> 00:27:10,728
Excuse me.

567
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,229
- Oh.

568
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,399
Yeah.

569
00:27:15,401 --> 00:27:17,301
- How much for this piece?

570
00:27:17,303 --> 00:27:20,671
- Oh, this one sold
already this morning.

571
00:27:20,673 --> 00:27:22,239
- Oh.

572
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:30,547
What about this one?

573
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:32,516
- That one sold, too.

574
00:27:32,684 --> 00:27:34,084
- Well, if they're sold,

575
00:27:34,086 --> 00:27:36,553
why haven't you put the
little red stickers on them?

576
00:27:36,555 --> 00:27:38,522
- Oh yeah.

577
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:41,091
They've been selling so fast

578
00:27:41,093 --> 00:27:45,029
that sometimes I just
forget about them.

579
00:27:45,031 --> 00:27:48,032
- Her work is very grim.

580
00:27:48,034 --> 00:27:50,534
- Yeah, it's pretty grim.

581
00:27:50,536 --> 00:27:52,403
- These are grim times.

582
00:27:52,405 --> 00:27:54,038
- Yeah.

583
00:27:54,806 --> 00:27:56,740
- Has everything sold?

584
00:27:56,742 --> 00:27:58,942
- Um, no.
We have one left.

585
00:27:58,944 --> 00:28:00,844
Follow me.

586
00:28:05,950 --> 00:28:07,518
There it is.

587
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:10,120
- Is that what I think it is?

588
00:28:10,122 --> 00:28:12,222
- What do you think it is?

589
00:28:12,224 --> 00:28:14,525
- A decapitated sperm.

590
00:28:14,527 --> 00:28:17,961
- Yes, that's it.
It's a decapitated sperm.

591
00:28:17,963 --> 00:28:19,897
- How much?
- Five thousand.

592
00:28:19,899 --> 00:28:21,899
- I'll take it.

593
00:28:25,637 --> 00:28:27,638
- Ta-da.

594
00:28:29,641 --> 00:28:31,475
- Thank you, friend.

595
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:33,744
There's not as much
as last time.

596
00:28:33,746 --> 00:28:36,313
- Yeah, can't really
control that though.

597
00:28:42,321 --> 00:28:44,555
- Open up.

598
00:28:44,557 --> 00:28:46,390
- Okay.

599
00:28:47,325 --> 00:28:48,058
- Okay.

600
00:28:48,060 --> 00:28:49,593
- More.
- Oh man.

601
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:52,596
- If I open up any more you
could go spelunking down there.

602
00:28:52,598 --> 00:28:53,630
- Okay.

603
00:28:53,632 --> 00:28:55,399
- Ready?
- Yeah.

604
00:28:56,334 --> 00:28:57,968
- Ah.

605
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:00,104
- I have a good
feeling about this.

606
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:02,239
- Get your legs up.
- Okay.

607
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:09,246
- What if I'm too old?

608
00:29:09,248 --> 00:29:11,515
- That's not what
the doctor said.

609
00:29:12,183 --> 00:29:15,185
- How could you
possibly be infertile?

610
00:29:16,855 --> 00:29:18,422
- It's okay.

611
00:29:18,424 --> 00:29:21,458
- We're going to be mommies.
- Mm-hmm.

612
00:29:21,460 --> 00:29:23,594
- Mommies.
- Mm-hmm.

613
00:29:23,596 --> 00:29:26,997
- The last time I had sperm
in me was in the 2nd grade.

614
00:29:27,298 --> 00:29:30,100
- You can't make jokes like that

615
00:29:30,102 --> 00:29:32,436
when the baby comes.

616
00:29:35,774 --> 00:29:38,509
- What if this baby
has two heads?

617
00:29:39,544 --> 00:29:43,447
- Well, then he'll breastfeed on
both breasts simultaneously.

618
00:29:43,449 --> 00:29:45,282
- Ew.

619
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:48,118
-<i> Come on, Veronica.</i>

620
00:29:48,120 --> 00:29:50,454
Oh, you're doing so good.

621
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:52,055
Just take one step.

622
00:29:52,057 --> 00:29:53,724
And then, after that...
You take another step.

623
00:29:53,726 --> 00:29:54,892
- Oh, is that how you do it?

624
00:29:54,894 --> 00:29:56,393
You take one step
and then another?

625
00:29:56,395 --> 00:29:57,861
- Really?
- Yeah.

626
00:29:57,863 --> 00:29:59,163
- It's like riding a bike,
remember?

627
00:29:59,165 --> 00:30:01,165
- Oh, is that how
you ride a bike?

628
00:30:01,167 --> 00:30:02,966
You take one step
and then another.

629
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:05,903
- Okay, Veronica.
Try and stay positive.

630
00:30:05,905 --> 00:30:08,038
- It's a beautiful day.
- Please don't say that.

631
00:30:08,040 --> 00:30:09,239
- Oh, why?

632
00:30:09,241 --> 00:30:11,208
- My husband used to say that.
- Oh, sorry.

633
00:30:11,210 --> 00:30:12,543
- I was just trying
to keep things positive.

634
00:30:12,545 --> 00:30:14,478
- Well, it's hard feeling
positive at the moment.

635
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:15,712
- I understand that.

636
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:17,214
- You know,
I don't think you do.

637
00:30:17,216 --> 00:30:19,216
My husband blew his
head off with a shotgun.

638
00:30:19,218 --> 00:30:20,584
- Well, that's a terrible
thing to think about.

639
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:21,685
So why don't we focus on you

640
00:30:21,687 --> 00:30:23,086
putting one foot
in front of the other.

641
00:30:23,088 --> 00:30:25,222
- My son is dead. Did you know that?
- I know.

642
00:30:25,224 --> 00:30:27,591
- He probably got his
head blown off, too.

643
00:30:27,593 --> 00:30:29,760
- I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to be insensitive.

644
00:30:29,762 --> 00:30:31,728
- My only living relative
is a madwoman

645
00:30:31,730 --> 00:30:32,930
living in a cabin in Maine.

646
00:30:32,932 --> 00:30:34,698
My life sucks.

647
00:30:34,700 --> 00:30:36,233
- Who is this relative?

648
00:30:36,235 --> 00:30:37,401
- My aunt.

649
00:30:37,403 --> 00:30:38,869
- I was told you
didn't have any family.

650
00:30:38,871 --> 00:30:41,071
- I haven't spoken
to her in years.

651
00:30:41,073 --> 00:30:45,742
- She's crazy, like,
like, Courtney love crazy.

652
00:30:45,744 --> 00:30:47,578
- I understand that, but
I think you should call her.

653
00:30:47,580 --> 00:30:49,079
- Oh, no way.
I can't do that.

654
00:30:49,081 --> 00:30:50,581
- I think you should.

655
00:30:50,583 --> 00:30:51,715
- Why?

656
00:30:51,717 --> 00:30:54,284
- Because you can't
stay here anymore.

657
00:30:54,286 --> 00:30:56,620
- No, I'm not ready to leave.

658
00:30:56,622 --> 00:30:58,422
- This is your last day?

659
00:30:58,424 --> 00:30:59,556
- What?

660
00:31:09,567 --> 00:31:12,402
- Oh, I know you're angry.

661
00:31:12,404 --> 00:31:14,605
I know you're upset.

662
00:31:14,607 --> 00:31:18,242
Oh, I feel it, too.

663
00:31:18,244 --> 00:31:22,145
Sometimes I get so angry
I want to torpedo the world.

664
00:31:22,147 --> 00:31:24,281
Oh, but just breathe.

665
00:31:24,283 --> 00:31:26,283
Just breathe.

666
00:31:28,754 --> 00:31:31,154
Just keep those tentacles
where they are.

667
00:31:36,394 --> 00:31:37,261
Hello.

668
00:31:37,263 --> 00:31:38,295
- Aunt Charlie?

669
00:31:38,297 --> 00:31:40,097
It's Veronica.

670
00:31:40,099 --> 00:31:41,298
- Veronica?

671
00:31:41,300 --> 00:31:42,766
- How are you doing?

672
00:31:42,768 --> 00:31:44,801
- I'm rotting away, Veronica.

673
00:31:45,770 --> 00:31:47,170
What do you want?

674
00:31:47,172 --> 00:31:52,509
- Um, I don't suppose
you heard the news?

675
00:31:52,511 --> 00:31:53,644
What happened?

676
00:31:53,646 --> 00:31:55,145
- Fuck the news.

677
00:31:55,147 --> 00:31:56,980
They don't report on what's
really happening, Veronica.

678
00:31:56,982 --> 00:31:58,815
- Charlie,
I need a place to stay.

679
00:31:58,817 --> 00:31:59,683
-<i> They only report on things</i>

680
00:31:59,685 --> 00:32:01,685
that happen above the surface.

681
00:32:01,687 --> 00:32:03,320
That's not the issue.

682
00:32:03,322 --> 00:32:04,988
It's below us.

683
00:32:04,990 --> 00:32:06,857
Inside the earth.

684
00:32:06,859 --> 00:32:08,325
<i>Deep down to the core.</i>

685
00:32:08,327 --> 00:32:09,693
<i>The big mutiny is
happening down there.</i>

686
00:32:09,695 --> 00:32:11,929
- Listen, Charlie.
Listen to me. I need a...

687
00:32:11,931 --> 00:32:14,865
- listen to me, Veronica.
I'm trying to assuage her.

688
00:32:14,867 --> 00:32:16,466
But she's not happy.

689
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:17,768
Pretty soon,
she's going to blow,

690
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:19,870
and when that happens,

691
00:32:19,872 --> 00:32:22,339
- <i>tentacles the size of skyscrapers...</i>
- Okay, good-bye aunt Charlie.

692
00:32:22,341 --> 00:32:24,308
- Lunatic.

693
00:32:24,876 --> 00:32:28,845
- So, you sold all the work?

694
00:32:28,847 --> 00:32:30,647
- Yeah. Yeah.

695
00:32:30,715 --> 00:32:32,015
- Very impressive.

696
00:32:32,017 --> 00:32:33,050
- Thanks.

697
00:32:33,052 --> 00:32:34,351
- I was wrong about you.

698
00:32:34,353 --> 00:32:35,686
- Well, yeah.

699
00:32:35,688 --> 00:32:38,889
- No, the war has changed
the country's mindset.

700
00:32:38,891 --> 00:32:42,192
The draft has made people
accept the horrors of war

701
00:32:42,194 --> 00:32:46,530
and you're capitalizing on it.

702
00:32:46,532 --> 00:32:48,465
- Well, I wouldn't say
I was capitalizing on it.

703
00:32:48,467 --> 00:32:51,068
I'm expressing the collective
dread of the country.

704
00:32:51,070 --> 00:32:54,171
- More like exploiting
the dread, but...

705
00:32:54,173 --> 00:32:56,707
- I wouldn't put it that way.

706
00:32:56,709 --> 00:32:59,509
I'm merely expressing
what I feel

707
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:01,244
- and then I'm putting it on the canvas.
- Are you still... excuse me?

708
00:33:01,246 --> 00:33:03,246
- Are you still
painting the bunnies?

709
00:33:03,248 --> 00:33:05,182
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

710
00:33:05,184 --> 00:33:07,150
Are you still
painting those bunnies?

711
00:33:07,152 --> 00:33:08,652
- Oh, yeah.

712
00:33:08,654 --> 00:33:11,555
- Huh, she's... She's adorable.
- Yeah.

713
00:33:11,557 --> 00:33:13,223
- So hopeful.

714
00:33:13,225 --> 00:33:14,925
I love her work, too.

715
00:33:14,927 --> 00:33:17,160
- Yeah, you should look
at it at her studio.

716
00:33:17,162 --> 00:33:18,729
Oh yeah, she doesn't have one.

717
00:33:18,731 --> 00:33:20,197
- I remember what she said.

718
00:33:20,199 --> 00:33:23,166
She said, "bunnies are sexual
yet innocent."

719
00:33:23,168 --> 00:33:24,735
- You can talk to her
about that later.

720
00:33:24,737 --> 00:33:28,939
- I don't remember anything
and I remember that.

721
00:33:28,941 --> 00:33:31,108
- Sally.

722
00:33:31,110 --> 00:33:33,910
Sally, is that a blue label?

723
00:33:33,912 --> 00:33:37,748
What?
Are you using blue labels?

724
00:33:37,750 --> 00:33:39,883
- Is this a blue fucking label?
- Oh yeah.

725
00:33:39,885 --> 00:33:42,019
- You're putting
a blue label on my art?

726
00:33:42,021 --> 00:33:43,453
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

727
00:33:43,455 --> 00:33:44,755
- What, do you think
I like blue?

728
00:33:44,757 --> 00:33:46,056
I hate blue.

729
00:33:46,058 --> 00:33:47,057
- I didn't know that.

730
00:33:47,059 --> 00:33:48,058
- Well, you should
have known that.

731
00:33:48,060 --> 00:33:50,093
Do I use blue in my art?

732
00:33:51,062 --> 00:33:53,463
- Well, there's... - no, I
don't, actually. Do I?

733
00:33:53,465 --> 00:33:56,133
- So why would I want
it on my fucking box?

734
00:33:56,135 --> 00:33:57,534
Don't you think when
people open up my box,

735
00:33:57,536 --> 00:33:58,802
they see blue,
they think of blue.

736
00:33:58,804 --> 00:34:01,204
That's a bit of a travesty,
don't you think?

737
00:34:01,206 --> 00:34:03,440
- I don't know.
- Yeah, yeah. What?

738
00:34:03,442 --> 00:34:04,975
- I don't know.
- Yeah, Sally. You know.

739
00:34:04,977 --> 00:34:05,976
- You fucking know.

740
00:34:05,978 --> 00:34:07,277
If there aren't
any white labels,

741
00:34:07,279 --> 00:34:08,545
you got to the store,

742
00:34:08,547 --> 00:34:10,113
you walk your fucking
butt out to the store

743
00:34:10,115 --> 00:34:11,715
and you get more white labels.

744
00:34:11,717 --> 00:34:14,785
You don't use blue labels.
Blue is fucking cute.

745
00:34:14,787 --> 00:34:17,554
My work isn't cute.
The world isn't cute.

746
00:34:18,189 --> 00:34:20,824
Cute isn't truthful.

747
00:34:20,826 --> 00:34:21,825
Blue isn't truthful.

748
00:34:21,827 --> 00:34:23,960
Blue is fucking bullshit, Sally.

749
00:34:23,962 --> 00:34:26,797
You get it?
You understand?

750
00:34:26,799 --> 00:34:28,799
Tell me you understand.

751
00:34:28,801 --> 00:34:32,302
Do you fucking understand
that blue isn't fucking cute?

752
00:34:33,604 --> 00:34:35,605
- Hello?
- I - I - yes.

753
00:34:35,607 --> 00:34:36,940
- Uh-huh?

754
00:34:36,942 --> 00:34:40,844
Tell me you know blue
isn't fucking cute, Sally.

755
00:34:40,846 --> 00:34:43,780
- I understand.
- Blue is bullshit.

756
00:34:43,782 --> 00:34:45,115
- I get it.
I'm sorry.

757
00:34:45,117 --> 00:34:47,484
- Take the fucking blue
label off your fucking box

758
00:34:47,486 --> 00:34:50,087
and go get some white ones.

759
00:34:50,089 --> 00:34:53,490
- In the meantime, take off
that blue fucking shirt.

760
00:34:53,492 --> 00:34:55,992
You fucking shithead.

761
00:34:56,861 --> 00:35:01,331
- I'm sorry my place
is so small, Mrs. salt.

762
00:35:01,333 --> 00:35:04,167
But you can stay on the
couch as long as you like.

763
00:35:04,169 --> 00:35:07,337
- Donna, call me Veronica.
Please.

764
00:35:07,339 --> 00:35:10,006
- If you want,
you can sleep in my bed,

765
00:35:10,008 --> 00:35:11,274
and I can sleep on the couch.

766
00:35:11,276 --> 00:35:13,443
- Why would you do that?

767
00:35:13,445 --> 00:35:16,346
- I just feel so bad for you.

768
00:35:16,348 --> 00:35:19,015
This world doesn't
make sense sometimes.

769
00:35:19,017 --> 00:35:20,851
But it's all part of god's plan.

770
00:35:20,853 --> 00:35:23,220
- Well, I wish he would
have planned better.

771
00:35:30,094 --> 00:35:32,295
- I have something for you.

772
00:35:35,633 --> 00:35:37,901
This is yours.

773
00:35:40,404 --> 00:35:41,872
- What's in here?

774
00:35:41,874 --> 00:35:42,906
- Pictures.

775
00:35:42,908 --> 00:35:44,474
Drawings.

776
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,476
Memories.

777
00:35:47,278 --> 00:35:49,212
- You know, I'm not sure

778
00:35:49,214 --> 00:35:50,881
if I'm going to
open it right now.

779
00:35:50,883 --> 00:35:52,749
- No, of course.
I'll leave you alone.

780
00:35:52,751 --> 00:35:55,519
- Oh no, you don't
have to do that. I just...

781
00:35:55,521 --> 00:35:57,687
You know,
I'm going to open it later.

782
00:35:57,689 --> 00:36:02,359
It feels like
a nice bottle of wine.

783
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:05,562
I should open it on
a special occasion.

784
00:36:05,564 --> 00:36:07,164
- Yes.

785
00:36:07,166 --> 00:36:09,866
- Wine.

786
00:36:09,868 --> 00:36:13,036
I like wine.
I forgot.

787
00:36:13,038 --> 00:36:16,006
- Would you like some wine?

788
00:36:16,008 --> 00:36:18,542
I could pour you a glass.

789
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:19,843
- Oh no.
That's okay.

790
00:36:19,845 --> 00:36:23,413
I'd rather just
rest if that's okay.

791
00:36:23,415 --> 00:36:25,782
I'm very tired.

792
00:36:40,531 --> 00:36:42,766
Why are you doing this?

793
00:36:42,768 --> 00:36:44,734
- I'm being a good Christian.

794
00:36:46,071 --> 00:36:48,605
When I think of how
little we paid you,

795
00:36:48,607 --> 00:36:49,973
it's embarrassing.

796
00:36:49,975 --> 00:36:52,042
- You gave me enough.

797
00:36:52,044 --> 00:36:54,711
I was able to
provide for my son.

798
00:36:55,646 --> 00:36:57,113
- You have a son.

799
00:36:57,115 --> 00:37:00,217
- Yes, you know this already.

800
00:37:00,219 --> 00:37:02,219
- Where is he?

801
00:37:02,221 --> 00:37:03,787
- He's fighting?

802
00:37:03,789 --> 00:37:04,921
- Is he a boxer?

803
00:37:04,923 --> 00:37:07,157
- He's a soldier.
- Oh, a soldier.

804
00:37:07,159 --> 00:37:08,291
Right.
That makes sense.

805
00:37:08,293 --> 00:37:10,160
- He got drafted.

806
00:37:11,529 --> 00:37:13,230
- Kip got drafted, too.

807
00:37:13,232 --> 00:37:17,100
- No, kip did not get drafted.

808
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,770
- What do you mean?

809
00:37:22,406 --> 00:37:24,574
- He volunteered.

810
00:37:26,577 --> 00:37:28,278
- You're pregnant.

811
00:37:28,280 --> 00:37:30,447
- Oh my god.

812
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:35,085
- Are you positive?
- I'm positive.

813
00:37:35,087 --> 00:37:37,320
- You're eight weeks along.
- Oh my god.

814
00:37:37,322 --> 00:37:38,521
- I'm shaking.

815
00:37:38,523 --> 00:37:39,789
Is it bad to be shaking?

816
00:37:39,791 --> 00:37:41,291
Is it normal to be
shaking after eight weeks?

817
00:37:41,293 --> 00:37:44,294
- It's completely normal.
You're just excited.

818
00:37:44,296 --> 00:37:45,795
It's all good.

819
00:37:45,797 --> 00:37:47,130
- How is it possible?

820
00:37:47,132 --> 00:37:49,299
How is this possible?

821
00:37:49,301 --> 00:37:52,035
- It's totally possible.
I'm positive.

822
00:37:55,973 --> 00:37:58,308
You can...
You can kiss.

823
00:37:58,310 --> 00:37:59,943
Yeah.

824
00:38:05,416 --> 00:38:08,018
- Oh, you're going to be
a good mommy.

825
00:38:17,161 --> 00:38:19,062
- You sure you want to do this?

826
00:38:19,064 --> 00:38:20,196
- Donna, I'm broke.

827
00:38:20,198 --> 00:38:22,232
I'm not qualified
to do anything else.

828
00:38:22,900 --> 00:38:24,334
- You don't have any rich
New York friends

829
00:38:24,336 --> 00:38:25,735
that can get you a job?

830
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:27,137
Isn't that how it works?

831
00:38:27,139 --> 00:38:29,506
- I never really had
any friends.

832
00:38:30,474 --> 00:38:33,076
- You look very pretty
in your uniform.

833
00:38:34,046 --> 00:38:35,712
Thank you.
You look nice, too.

834
00:38:37,683 --> 00:38:39,349
Do you know how to make a bed?

835
00:38:39,351 --> 00:38:42,152
- Of course, Donna.
What do you think I am,

836
00:38:42,154 --> 00:38:43,653
a moron?

837
00:38:43,655 --> 00:38:44,854
- No.

838
00:38:44,856 --> 00:38:47,357
I just thought maybe
it was beneath you.

839
00:38:50,294 --> 00:38:52,395
- I must have been
such a jerk before.

840
00:38:52,397 --> 00:38:54,097
- You weren't a jerk.

841
00:38:54,099 --> 00:38:55,699
You had a lot of money.

842
00:38:55,701 --> 00:38:57,200
And it's human nature

843
00:38:57,202 --> 00:38:59,669
for people to think they're
above this kind of thing.

844
00:38:59,671 --> 00:39:01,705
- Yeah, well.

845
00:39:01,707 --> 00:39:02,939
When you hit rock bottom,

846
00:39:02,941 --> 00:39:05,909
there's nothing really
beneath you is there?

847
00:39:05,911 --> 00:39:07,444
- Rock?

848
00:39:07,446 --> 00:39:10,080
Yeah, ha-ha.
Rock.

849
00:39:13,651 --> 00:39:16,286
Sucks. Sucks.
Sucks. Sucks.

850
00:39:26,664 --> 00:39:29,599
This piece sucks, too.
I hate this piece.

851
00:39:30,201 --> 00:39:32,202
- Hey, Sally!
- Yeah.

852
00:39:33,304 --> 00:39:35,472
- I can't stand the lines
you're draw...

853
00:39:35,474 --> 00:39:36,806
They're too thick.

854
00:39:36,808 --> 00:39:40,410
I asked you to draw
a nice precise line

855
00:39:40,412 --> 00:39:43,780
over the lines
that I already drew.

856
00:39:43,782 --> 00:39:45,882
You're my assistant,
you've got to assist me.

857
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:47,617
You've got to help me do it.
Just a nice thin line.

858
00:39:47,619 --> 00:39:49,419
Loosen your hand.

859
00:39:49,987 --> 00:39:51,588
Draw the line.

860
00:39:51,590 --> 00:39:53,256
- Yeah, yeah.
I mean, I know.

861
00:39:53,258 --> 00:39:55,125
I just thought for this one,

862
00:39:55,127 --> 00:39:58,294
the thicker line looked
a little bit better.

863
00:39:59,764 --> 00:40:02,632
- Sometimes I want to
punch you in the face.

864
00:40:08,840 --> 00:40:10,573
- I'll do it good.
I'll try...

865
00:40:10,575 --> 00:40:12,776
- I don't care.
I don't care. It sucks.

866
00:40:15,579 --> 00:40:17,680
Sometimes...

867
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:25,955
Alright, Sally.
Sally, bring me the pink.

868
00:40:25,957 --> 00:40:27,123
Bring me the pink paint.

869
00:40:27,125 --> 00:40:29,459
Uh, face color.
Nat...

870
00:40:29,461 --> 00:40:30,960
Uh, you know, face.
Face.

871
00:40:30,962 --> 00:40:32,295
Sometimes I want to
punch you in the face.

872
00:40:32,297 --> 00:40:33,630
Sometimes I want to punch you...

873
00:40:33,632 --> 00:40:35,965
- get over here and bring
me that fucking paint!

874
00:40:35,967 --> 00:40:38,168
Sometimes I want to
punch you in the face.

875
00:40:46,110 --> 00:40:47,677
Good.

876
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:55,852
Good.

877
00:41:07,532 --> 00:41:09,165
- Housekeeping.

878
00:41:13,437 --> 00:41:14,571
Oh, I'm sorry.

879
00:41:14,573 --> 00:41:16,473
- No, no, no, no.
You can come in now.

880
00:41:16,475 --> 00:41:19,676
I will sit on the floor.
I won't be in your way.

881
00:41:19,678 --> 00:41:20,844
That's okay.

882
00:41:20,846 --> 00:41:22,011
I can just give you
these clean towels.

883
00:41:22,013 --> 00:41:23,513
- Look, I have no
need for clean towels.

884
00:41:23,515 --> 00:41:26,149
I'm going to pay you
to come in and clean.

885
00:41:26,151 --> 00:41:27,350
I will sit on the floor.

886
00:41:27,352 --> 00:41:30,220
I will do my stretches,
my kegel exercises.

887
00:41:30,222 --> 00:41:34,691
I'll watch you work.
You clean the room.

888
00:41:34,693 --> 00:41:37,360
And I'll give you
one hundred dollars.

889
00:41:37,362 --> 00:41:39,762
- No, that's okay.
Here.

890
00:41:45,302 --> 00:41:47,036
- Not bad.

891
00:41:50,541 --> 00:41:52,208
What do you think?

892
00:41:52,210 --> 00:41:53,877
- It's really good.

893
00:41:53,879 --> 00:41:55,578
- It's a fucking masterpiece.

894
00:41:55,580 --> 00:41:57,113
<i>- Well, the tone in
Washington right now</i>

895
00:41:57,115 --> 00:41:58,281
<i>is very somber.</i>

896
00:41:58,283 --> 00:42:01,050
<i>We lost another
600 troops this week.</i>

897
00:42:01,052 --> 00:42:03,219
<i>The military has responded</i>

898
00:42:03,221 --> 00:42:04,954
<i>with an onslaught
of carpet bombs</i>

899
00:42:04,956 --> 00:42:06,723
<i>and bunker busters.</i>

900
00:42:06,725 --> 00:42:08,758
<i>We're not clear how many
civilian casualties</i>

901
00:42:08,760 --> 00:42:10,293
<i>have resulted from the campaign,</i>

902
00:42:10,295 --> 00:42:13,596
<i>but does it really matter?</i>

903
00:42:13,598 --> 00:42:15,131
<i>Let's bring out
the fart machine.</i>

904
00:42:25,709 --> 00:42:27,277
- I spoke to my son today.

905
00:42:27,279 --> 00:42:28,478
- Oh, that's nice.

906
00:42:28,480 --> 00:42:30,713
- He's getting a month
leave from the war.

907
00:42:30,715 --> 00:42:32,482
- Oh, that's wonderful.

908
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:36,953
You must worry about him.

909
00:42:36,955 --> 00:42:38,588
- Always.

910
00:42:39,523 --> 00:42:41,791
I don't know what
it's like over there,

911
00:42:41,793 --> 00:42:43,293
but I imagine the worst.

912
00:42:43,295 --> 00:42:46,996
- Well, no one seems to be
taking it seriously over here.

913
00:42:46,998 --> 00:42:48,831
- I think people are
taking it very seriously.

914
00:42:48,833 --> 00:42:50,233
- What, with the fart machine?

915
00:42:50,235 --> 00:42:51,668
That's all everyone watches.

916
00:42:51,670 --> 00:42:54,804
- Well, it's good to laugh.

917
00:42:55,005 --> 00:42:57,807
- Do you think people are
laughing in the middle east?

918
00:42:59,611 --> 00:43:01,945
This is a war on terror.

919
00:43:01,947 --> 00:43:05,181
- What does that even mean,
Donna?

920
00:43:05,183 --> 00:43:07,317
There is no war on terror.

921
00:43:07,319 --> 00:43:09,085
It's not even real.

922
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:12,255
Do you know what I was
doing during the war on drugs?

923
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:14,023
Getting stoned.

924
00:43:17,394 --> 00:43:20,096
- You dishonor your son.

925
00:43:22,800 --> 00:43:24,934
- It's weird.
- No, it's not.

926
00:43:24,936 --> 00:43:27,036
- It is so weird,
I'm telling you.

927
00:43:27,038 --> 00:43:28,538
- I'm just practicing.

928
00:43:28,540 --> 00:43:30,807
The more prepared we are,
the better parents we'll be.

929
00:43:30,809 --> 00:43:32,375
- It's creepy as fuck.

930
00:43:32,377 --> 00:43:34,310
- Don't swear
in front of the baby.

931
00:43:34,312 --> 00:43:35,778
- Would you stop.

932
00:43:35,780 --> 00:43:37,046
- The baby doesn't even have ears yet.
- I know.

933
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:39,015
- It's probably going
to be born without ears.

934
00:43:39,017 --> 00:43:40,783
- I wish you'd stop
saying things like that.

935
00:43:40,785 --> 00:43:42,619
- I just think you're
being way too premature.

936
00:43:42,621 --> 00:43:44,721
- And you're being immature.
- Immature? Really?

937
00:43:44,723 --> 00:43:46,289
- You're walking around
with a fake baby.

938
00:43:46,291 --> 00:43:48,191
- I'm excited, Ashley.

939
00:43:48,193 --> 00:43:51,294
- It's just that
you're being unrealistic.

940
00:43:51,296 --> 00:43:53,730
Honey, you're making
all these preparations,

941
00:43:53,732 --> 00:43:55,064
what happens if the
baby falls through?

942
00:43:55,066 --> 00:43:57,800
Then we've got all
this crap that just,

943
00:43:57,802 --> 00:44:01,404
I don't know, reminds us
of the one that got away.

944
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:05,408
- When the baby comes,

945
00:44:05,410 --> 00:44:07,744
she's going to be beautiful...

946
00:44:07,746 --> 00:44:09,412
And healthy.

947
00:44:09,414 --> 00:44:12,815
Even if she has two heads
and no ears,

948
00:44:12,817 --> 00:44:14,684
I don't care.

949
00:44:15,352 --> 00:44:17,654
- What if it's a he?

950
00:44:18,589 --> 00:44:22,425
Then he'll be an idiot
like all the rest,

951
00:44:22,427 --> 00:44:25,061
but we'll love him all the same.

952
00:44:27,865 --> 00:44:30,333
- Mommy's just scared.
- Oh, creepy.

953
00:45:04,334 --> 00:45:09,639
- Oh, it's so cute.
Thank you, rose.

954
00:45:09,641 --> 00:45:10,573
- Of course.

955
00:45:10,575 --> 00:45:12,041
- Oh.

956
00:45:12,043 --> 00:45:16,112
- But it says,
"10 percent polyester."

957
00:45:16,114 --> 00:45:18,781
A baby's skin
can't touch polyester.

958
00:45:19,516 --> 00:45:20,883
I'm so sorry.

959
00:45:20,885 --> 00:45:24,053
It's so cute though.
Thank you.

960
00:45:24,055 --> 00:45:25,955
- I put the gift
receipt in the bag.

961
00:45:25,957 --> 00:45:27,990
- Oh, great.
I'll return it.

962
00:45:28,592 --> 00:45:31,227
- It's from me.
- Thank you, Rachel.

963
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:36,099
- Oh, look.

964
00:45:36,101 --> 00:45:38,067
- It teaches you to crawl.
The baby to crawl.

965
00:45:38,069 --> 00:45:39,335
- Where did you get it?

966
00:45:39,337 --> 00:45:41,237
- This summer when
Doug and I were traveling...

967
00:45:41,239 --> 00:45:43,106
In the tiniest,
cutest little shop,

968
00:45:43,108 --> 00:45:46,242
this artist makes
everything by hand.

969
00:45:46,244 --> 00:45:49,278
- Didn't you say that you and
Doug went to China this summer?

970
00:45:49,280 --> 00:45:51,748
- Yeah.
That's where I got it.

971
00:45:51,750 --> 00:45:53,750
- Rachel.
China?

972
00:45:53,752 --> 00:45:55,785
We have terrible standards here.

973
00:45:55,787 --> 00:45:58,654
But China?
There's like, no standards.

974
00:45:58,656 --> 00:46:01,424
- Oh honey,
this is a renown artist.

975
00:46:01,426 --> 00:46:02,658
You've nothing to worry about.

976
00:46:02,660 --> 00:46:04,694
- Well, I'm sure
he knows nothing about

977
00:46:04,696 --> 00:46:06,529
not using lead paint.

978
00:46:06,531 --> 00:46:08,431
Who knows what's in this thing?

979
00:46:08,433 --> 00:46:09,932
- It was really expensive.

980
00:46:09,934 --> 00:46:12,268
- So is getting
your stomach pumped.

981
00:46:14,738 --> 00:46:17,306
- This paper is recycled.

982
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:20,810
- Thanks, christie.

983
00:46:23,747 --> 00:46:25,448
Oh, what's this?

984
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:26,783
- It's a baby monitor.

985
00:46:26,785 --> 00:46:28,518
It's for if you're outside
or in the other room,

986
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:30,887
you can hear him crying or...

987
00:46:31,421 --> 00:46:33,790
- But it says, "wifi."

988
00:46:34,124 --> 00:46:35,224
- Yeah.

989
00:46:35,226 --> 00:46:37,994
- I don't trust wifi
around the baby.

990
00:46:37,996 --> 00:46:40,296
All those electronic signals,

991
00:46:40,298 --> 00:46:43,566
it's not good for the little
baby's developing brain.

992
00:46:43,568 --> 00:46:45,635
- I'm pretty sure
it's safe, Lisa.

993
00:46:45,637 --> 00:46:47,737
I mean, they wouldn't
release it to the public...

994
00:46:47,739 --> 00:46:50,506
- well, look at all the things
they release to the public.

995
00:46:50,508 --> 00:46:53,476
- I actually used one when
I had Sam and it's fine.

996
00:46:53,478 --> 00:46:55,311
- Yeah, you need one.

997
00:46:55,313 --> 00:46:56,646
- A lot of them are wireless.

998
00:46:56,648 --> 00:46:58,481
- Yeah.
- Mm-hmm, yeah.

999
00:46:58,483 --> 00:47:00,917
- Um, didn't you say

1000
00:47:00,919 --> 00:47:03,719
that Sam didn't do
very well in first grade?

1001
00:47:03,721 --> 00:47:05,721
That they almost held him back?

1002
00:47:05,723 --> 00:47:09,358
- He just wasn't ready to be
around children at that time.

1003
00:47:09,360 --> 00:47:15,198
- Well, maybe if he hadn't
been exposed to wifi

1004
00:47:15,200 --> 00:47:16,332
at such an early age,

1005
00:47:16,334 --> 00:47:18,668
maybe he would have done better.

1006
00:47:31,882 --> 00:47:32,849
- Excuse me.
Excuse me.

1007
00:47:32,851 --> 00:47:34,083
- Excuse me.
- Yes.

1008
00:47:34,085 --> 00:47:36,519
- Do you clean
the rooms on this floor?

1009
00:47:36,521 --> 00:47:37,720
- Yes.

1010
00:47:37,722 --> 00:47:39,355
- Did you take that
magazine out of my room?

1011
00:47:39,357 --> 00:47:40,723
- What?

1012
00:47:40,725 --> 00:47:42,358
- The magazine in your pocket,
this is my magazine.

1013
00:47:42,360 --> 00:47:43,559
- No, it's not.

1014
00:47:43,561 --> 00:47:46,128
- I am in room 412.
Did you clean room 412?

1015
00:47:46,130 --> 00:47:49,699
- I manage the
housekeepers on this floor.

1016
00:47:49,701 --> 00:47:51,934
The only ones who actually clean
the rooms are the Mexicans.

1017
00:47:51,936 --> 00:47:53,970
- So you bought this magazine?
- Of course, I did.

1018
00:47:53,972 --> 00:47:55,771
- What are you, an art collector?
- Maybe.

1019
00:47:55,773 --> 00:47:56,873
- This is my magazine.

1020
00:47:56,875 --> 00:48:00,042
Yeah, yeah.
You see this circle?

1021
00:48:00,044 --> 00:48:02,111
I circled that quote.

1022
00:48:02,113 --> 00:48:03,045
- Really?
Why did you do that?

1023
00:48:03,047 --> 00:48:04,981
- Because she speaks to me.

1024
00:48:04,983 --> 00:48:06,449
Because she's a fucking genius.

1025
00:48:06,451 --> 00:48:07,984
- Well, I don't think
she's a genius.

1026
00:48:07,986 --> 00:48:09,552
My son draws better than her.

1027
00:48:09,554 --> 00:48:11,320
- I wonder what else
you stole from my room.

1028
00:48:11,322 --> 00:48:12,788
- It's just a magazine.

1029
00:48:12,790 --> 00:48:14,056
If you're staying here,

1030
00:48:14,058 --> 00:48:15,424
you can probably afford
another one.

1031
00:48:15,426 --> 00:48:18,261
- Well, that doesn't entitle
you to take what's mine.

1032
00:48:18,263 --> 00:48:20,897
- No.
I'm not entitled.

1033
00:48:20,899 --> 00:48:22,465
You are the entitled one.

1034
00:48:22,467 --> 00:48:24,233
- Why?
Because I'm rich?

1035
00:48:24,235 --> 00:48:26,469
- Because I'm white?
- No.

1036
00:48:26,471 --> 00:48:28,771
- Because you're a dick.

1037
00:48:29,506 --> 00:48:30,806
-<i> I hate it, okay.</i>

1038
00:48:30,808 --> 00:48:32,909
No, put it here for one second.

1039
00:48:32,911 --> 00:48:33,943
Let me see it.

1040
00:48:33,945 --> 00:48:35,411
I need yellow
next to the debris.

1041
00:48:35,413 --> 00:48:37,413
If there's one here,
a little bit smaller.

1042
00:48:37,415 --> 00:48:39,282
- Ashley.
- Yes.

1043
00:48:39,284 --> 00:48:42,184
- Indieart magazine is here.
They want to interview you.

1044
00:48:42,186 --> 00:48:43,619
- Indieart.

1045
00:48:43,621 --> 00:48:45,288
They never wanted to
interview me before,

1046
00:48:45,290 --> 00:48:46,155
now they're here.

1047
00:48:46,157 --> 00:48:47,924
Tell them to go fuck themselves.

1048
00:48:47,926 --> 00:48:50,526
I'm kidding.
Of course, I'm kidding.

1049
00:48:50,528 --> 00:48:52,528
Would you bring them in please.

1050
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:54,764
Oh, the pressure, you guys.
I can't believe it.

1051
00:48:54,766 --> 00:48:56,766
I've been under
a rock for so long.

1052
00:48:56,768 --> 00:49:00,670
So misunderstood
and fucking ignored.

1053
00:49:00,672 --> 00:49:03,039
- Okay, I... Uh...
- Ashley.

1054
00:49:03,041 --> 00:49:04,840
- Leave that wall for a second

1055
00:49:04,842 --> 00:49:06,776
- and let's come over here and
start looking at some... - Ashley.

1056
00:49:06,778 --> 00:49:10,813
- Some... sorry. Excuse me.
- This is indieart.

1057
00:49:10,815 --> 00:49:12,548
- Hi.
- Hi.

1058
00:49:12,550 --> 00:49:14,317
- Frederic. Indieart.
- I'm Ashley.

1059
00:49:14,319 --> 00:49:16,118
- So nice to meet you.
- How are you?

1060
00:49:16,120 --> 00:49:17,853
- Let's get right to it.
- Okay.

1061
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:20,156
- Ah!

1062
00:49:21,158 --> 00:49:22,491
- I'm home, mom.

1063
00:49:23,661 --> 00:49:25,461
- I'm home.
- Oh, look at you.

1064
00:49:25,463 --> 00:49:27,330
- All in one piece.

1065
00:49:27,397 --> 00:49:30,199
- It must be so
dangerous over there.

1066
00:49:30,201 --> 00:49:31,667
- It is.

1067
00:49:32,269 --> 00:49:34,036
It's supposed to be.

1068
00:49:35,439 --> 00:49:37,473
- They should respect us.

1069
00:49:37,475 --> 00:49:38,975
- They'll be more
respectful of us,

1070
00:49:38,977 --> 00:49:41,043
when we're more
respectful of them.

1071
00:49:41,045 --> 00:49:43,145
- Well, when someone's
pointing a gun at you,

1072
00:49:43,147 --> 00:49:44,880
- what choice do you have?
- What do you mean?

1073
00:49:44,882 --> 00:49:47,016
- You have to respect them.

1074
00:49:50,687 --> 00:49:53,189
- So, my mom
used to work for you?

1075
00:49:54,591 --> 00:49:56,158
- Yeah.

1076
00:49:57,961 --> 00:50:00,896
- And exactly how long do
you plan on staying here?

1077
00:50:00,898 --> 00:50:04,500
- She'll be going to her
aunt's in a few days, right?

1078
00:50:04,502 --> 00:50:05,601
- Yes.

1079
00:50:05,603 --> 00:50:07,703
- You bought that
bus ticket already?

1080
00:50:09,006 --> 00:50:10,940
- Yes.

1081
00:50:11,875 --> 00:50:14,010
<i>- Wait. Whoa.
What are you...</i>

1082
00:50:14,012 --> 00:50:16,879
What are you doing?

1083
00:50:16,881 --> 00:50:18,114
- I'm painting these walls.

1084
00:50:18,116 --> 00:50:19,949
- There's no way we're
keeping these walls red.

1085
00:50:19,951 --> 00:50:21,283
- Well, why not?

1086
00:50:21,285 --> 00:50:22,785
- Why do you think?

1087
00:50:22,787 --> 00:50:24,420
- Can we just wait
until the baby's born,

1088
00:50:24,422 --> 00:50:25,688
maybe, and then we
can decide whether or not

1089
00:50:25,690 --> 00:50:27,123
we want to change the walls.

1090
00:50:27,125 --> 00:50:28,357
- No.

1091
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:30,626
Because this red
reminds me of a miscarriage.

1092
00:50:30,628 --> 00:50:32,294
Is that what you want?
Miscarriage red?

1093
00:50:32,296 --> 00:50:34,463
- Oh, is that a color?
Yeah, that's what I want.

1094
00:50:34,465 --> 00:50:35,731
I want miscarriage red
for our walls.

1095
00:50:35,733 --> 00:50:38,467
- I hate these walls.
- Since when?

1096
00:50:38,469 --> 00:50:40,603
- Since always.
They freak me out.

1097
00:50:40,605 --> 00:50:42,638
- Oh, you know what
freaks me out?

1098
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:45,041
- You obsessing over a baby
that isn't even born yet.

1099
00:50:45,043 --> 00:50:47,076
Do you know that every single
time you have this little thing

1100
00:50:47,078 --> 00:50:48,711
on your chest, it makes me
want to jump out of a window.

1101
00:50:48,713 --> 00:50:50,212
- What are you doing?
- This is a fake baby.

1102
00:50:50,214 --> 00:50:52,248
- It's a fake baby.
- It's my baby.

1103
00:50:52,250 --> 00:50:54,083
- Give me my baby.
- This is a fake baby!

1104
00:50:54,085 --> 00:50:56,118
- Let go of the baby!
- Give it to me!

1105
00:50:56,120 --> 00:50:58,788
- It's a fake baby!
- It's not a fake baby!

1106
00:50:58,790 --> 00:51:02,658
- It is a fake baby!
- It's my baby!

1107
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:04,994
- Give me my baby.

1108
00:51:04,996 --> 00:51:07,296
- I hate you.
- Fucking fake baby.

1109
00:51:07,298 --> 00:51:08,464
- I hate you.

1110
00:51:08,466 --> 00:51:11,300
She didn't mean it.
She didn't mean it.

1111
00:51:15,572 --> 00:51:17,406
- Thank you.

1112
00:51:17,741 --> 00:51:21,310
And how many nights are
you going to be staying here?

1113
00:51:21,312 --> 00:51:22,344
- A couple.

1114
00:51:22,346 --> 00:51:23,345
- Yeah?

1115
00:51:23,347 --> 00:51:25,181
And where are you visiting from?

1116
00:51:25,183 --> 00:51:26,916
- Um, nowhere?

1117
00:51:26,918 --> 00:51:28,150
- What's that?

1118
00:51:28,152 --> 00:51:29,585
- Nowhere.

1119
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:32,521
- Did you say nowhere?

1120
00:51:32,523 --> 00:51:33,656
- Yeah.
I just said "nowhere."

1121
00:51:33,658 --> 00:51:35,458
What are you, deaf?

1122
00:51:37,427 --> 00:51:39,829
- Yeah. I, uh...

1123
00:51:39,831 --> 00:51:41,697
I am actually.

1124
00:51:41,699 --> 00:51:44,667
I lost eighty percent of my
hearing when I was a teenager

1125
00:51:44,669 --> 00:51:49,038
because my dad
wasn't a very "nice man".

1126
00:51:49,040 --> 00:51:54,443
But here are your keys.

1127
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:55,544
- Room twelve.
- I didn't know.

1128
00:51:55,546 --> 00:51:58,180
- I didn't know.
- Have a great night.

1129
00:51:59,583 --> 00:52:01,984
- I also have psoriasis,

1130
00:52:01,986 --> 00:52:04,320
all along the inside
of my thigh.

1131
00:52:04,322 --> 00:52:07,022
So, if you want to
make fun of that, too.

1132
00:52:07,024 --> 00:52:08,724
- No.

1133
00:52:08,726 --> 00:52:12,995
- And, I have ringworm.

1134
00:52:12,997 --> 00:52:15,231
On my genitals.

1135
00:52:15,233 --> 00:52:16,799
Ringworm.

1136
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:19,668
You ever heard of
"ring around the collar?"

1137
00:52:19,670 --> 00:52:21,003
- Um, yep.

1138
00:52:21,005 --> 00:52:22,171
- I have "ring around
the scrotum."

1139
00:52:22,173 --> 00:52:23,739
- Okay. Okay.

1140
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:26,308
- Just try to be
nicer to people.

1141
00:53:24,034 --> 00:53:25,467
-<i> Hi, mom.</i>

1142
00:53:25,469 --> 00:53:27,703
<i>It's me.</i>

1143
00:53:28,505 --> 00:53:32,474
<i>Uh, you've been asleep now
for about six months.</i>

1144
00:53:32,476 --> 00:53:34,276
<i>I don't know what happened</i>

1145
00:53:34,278 --> 00:53:36,478
<i>the night you fell
down the stairs,</i>

1146
00:53:36,480 --> 00:53:42,218
<i>but I have been thinking
a lot about my life since then.</i>

1147
00:53:42,220 --> 00:53:45,421
<i>And I got accepted
into art school,</i>

1148
00:53:45,423 --> 00:53:48,757
<i>but I'm enlisting in
the war effort instead.</i>

1149
00:53:48,759 --> 00:53:51,660
<i>I'm shipping off to
the middle east tomorrow.</i>

1150
00:53:51,662 --> 00:53:54,763
<i>I thought about what you
said about making a difference</i>

1151
00:53:54,765 --> 00:53:56,966
<i>and I think I can make
more of a difference</i>

1152
00:53:56,968 --> 00:54:03,072
<i>making peace over there
than making art over here.</i>

1153
00:54:03,074 --> 00:54:06,008
<i>So, I love you, mom.</i>

1154
00:54:06,010 --> 00:54:11,113
<i>And I'll see you
when I get back.</i>

1155
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:48,384
- Uh, hey.
Have you seen Lisa?

1156
00:54:48,386 --> 00:54:49,485
- Oh, no.

1157
00:54:49,487 --> 00:54:50,953
- Where the fuck is she?
Is she coming?

1158
00:54:50,955 --> 00:54:52,888
Lisa, where are you?

1159
00:54:52,890 --> 00:54:54,890
Really?
You're not going to show up?

1160
00:54:57,227 --> 00:54:58,994
Call me back.

1161
00:54:59,663 --> 00:55:03,866
- <i>Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.</i>

1162
00:55:03,868 --> 00:55:08,070
<i>Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.</i>

1163
00:55:08,171 --> 00:55:12,241
<i>Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.</i>

1164
00:55:12,642 --> 00:55:16,745
<i>Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.</i>

1165
00:55:17,147 --> 00:55:21,016
<i>Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.</i>

1166
00:55:21,418 --> 00:55:25,421
<i>Shit. Shit. Shit. Shit.</i>

1167
00:55:25,423 --> 00:55:27,323
- It's brilliant.

1168
00:55:30,361 --> 00:55:33,095
- It's radiant.
Really.

1169
00:55:33,097 --> 00:55:34,430
- Radiant?

1170
00:55:34,432 --> 00:55:37,499
Now come on, no one's ever
said that about my work.

1171
00:55:37,501 --> 00:55:39,535
- It really is, Ashley.
And you're radiant.

1172
00:55:39,537 --> 00:55:42,338
You're positively glowing.

1173
00:55:45,642 --> 00:55:48,177
- Maybe there's a reason.
I don't know.

1174
00:55:48,179 --> 00:55:49,912
- Uh...

1175
00:55:49,914 --> 00:55:52,448
Why don't you tell me
about that one over there.

1176
00:55:52,450 --> 00:55:53,849
- Sure. Yeah.
Which?

1177
00:55:53,851 --> 00:55:55,451
- Um... uh...
- This one right here.

1178
00:55:55,453 --> 00:55:56,585
- Oh.

1179
00:55:56,587 --> 00:55:59,288
- I haven't seen all the work
- yeah.

1180
00:55:59,290 --> 00:56:01,924
- But I just gravitate
to this one.

1181
00:56:01,926 --> 00:56:03,225
- Yeah.
One of my favorites.

1182
00:56:03,227 --> 00:56:05,260
I'm thinking about buying it.

1183
00:56:05,262 --> 00:56:07,062
- Oh, it's not for sale...

1184
00:56:07,064 --> 00:56:08,931
I don't know if I'm going
to sell it, actually.

1185
00:56:08,933 --> 00:56:12,434
- Well, you know.
Every painting has a price.

1186
00:56:12,436 --> 00:56:13,802
- Okay. Well.

1187
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:16,472
Okay.
We can talk about it later.

1188
00:56:16,474 --> 00:56:19,408
- What inspired it?

1189
00:56:19,410 --> 00:56:21,744
- Sometimes people
just need their ass kicked.

1190
00:57:22,138 --> 00:57:25,507
- .<i> ..It's like the</i>
<i>celebration of life, it's...</i>

1191
00:57:25,509 --> 00:57:27,810
<i>I mean, or the human spirit.</i>

1192
00:57:27,812 --> 00:57:32,815
<i>In order to create, you have to
destroy the worn out paradigms</i>

1193
00:57:32,817 --> 00:57:34,883
<i>that prohibit progress.</i>

1194
00:57:34,885 --> 00:57:36,151
<i>You know
and that's what this is about.</i>

1195
00:57:36,153 --> 00:57:39,388
<i>This is about...
This is what art is for.</i>

1196
00:57:39,390 --> 00:57:42,558
<i>This is about
changing the world.</i>

1197
00:57:42,560 --> 00:57:44,993
<i>That's what this is... to me.</i>

1198
00:57:44,995 --> 00:57:47,362
<i>I mean,
hopefully at that point...</i>

1199
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:51,133
<i>- That would be tough.</i>

1200
00:57:51,135 --> 00:57:52,701
<i>- Because it is.
It's like, this is art.</i>

1201
00:57:52,703 --> 00:57:55,504
<i>Art is about changing the world.</i>

1202
00:57:55,506 --> 00:57:57,339
- You're a hack.

1203
00:57:58,408 --> 00:57:59,675
Bullshit.

1204
00:58:02,812 --> 00:58:04,046
- Veronica?

1205
00:58:04,048 --> 00:58:06,815
- In the flesh, baby cakes.
In the flesh.

1206
00:58:09,018 --> 00:58:10,752
- Knock it off.

1207
00:58:22,532 --> 00:58:24,867
- Get out of my way!
Get out of my way!

1208
00:58:25,702 --> 00:58:27,102
This is mine.

1209
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,904
This is mine!

1210
00:58:28,972 --> 00:58:30,939
This is mine!

1211
00:58:33,643 --> 00:58:35,077
- Fuck.

1212
00:58:35,079 --> 00:58:36,712
Fuck!

1213
00:58:42,786 --> 00:58:44,720
- Brilliant.

1214
00:59:15,885 --> 00:59:17,252
- Hey!

1215
00:59:17,254 --> 00:59:19,321
Huh? Huh?

1216
00:59:19,323 --> 00:59:21,256
Huh?
How about this?

1217
00:59:21,258 --> 00:59:23,158
- Ahh!

1218
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:27,629
- Look at me.
Huh. Huh. Huh. Huh.

1219
00:59:27,631 --> 00:59:29,231
How about this?

1220
00:59:31,601 --> 00:59:33,335
Get up!

1221
00:59:45,782 --> 00:59:47,316
Ah!

1222
01:00:12,475 --> 01:00:14,343
- Oh my god.

1223
01:00:22,251 --> 01:00:24,386
- That's all you fucking got?

1224
01:00:26,990 --> 01:00:28,557
- Fuck you!

1225
01:00:37,834 --> 01:00:39,568
Ah!

1226
01:00:52,849 --> 01:00:54,850
- Oh yeah.

1227
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,552
Oh yeah.

1228
01:01:09,532 --> 01:01:11,066
- Fuck you.

1229
01:01:13,202 --> 01:01:14,836
You want another one?

1230
01:01:14,838 --> 01:01:16,605
- Ah!

1231
01:01:24,280 --> 01:01:25,881
- Ah!

1232
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:34,923
Ah!

1233
01:04:11,814 --> 01:04:13,348
-<i> Well, it's official.</i>

1234
01:04:13,350 --> 01:04:16,418
<i>The war on terror is over.</i>

1235
01:04:16,420 --> 01:04:18,553
<i>Yes, incredibly,
the draft worked.</i>

1236
01:04:18,555 --> 01:04:20,722
<i>Committing millions of troops
in the middle east</i>

1237
01:04:20,724 --> 01:04:22,557
<i>gave us the competitive
edge that we needed</i>

1238
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:24,059
<i>to take control and conquer.</i>

1239
01:04:24,061 --> 01:04:29,097
<i>And as a result, western
culture is spreading like kudzu.</i>

1240
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:31,099
<i>People in the middle east
are watching netflix.</i>

1241
01:04:31,101 --> 01:04:33,568
<i>They're using social media.</i>

1242
01:04:33,570 --> 01:04:35,403
<i>They're eating fast-food.</i>

1243
01:04:35,405 --> 01:04:37,105
<i>They're even dropping acid.</i>

1244
01:04:37,107 --> 01:04:39,241
<i>And not the kind you throw
in people's faces either.</i>

1245
01:04:41,111 --> 01:04:44,246
<i>Americans are saying that
for the first time since 9/11,</i>

1246
01:04:44,248 --> 01:04:47,449
<i>they feel a real sense
of ease and comfort.</i>

1247
01:04:47,451 --> 01:04:49,784
<i>In fact, homeland security</i>

1248
01:04:49,786 --> 01:04:53,088
<i>has once again updated its
color-coded warning system,</i>

1249
01:04:53,090 --> 01:04:54,422
<i>let's take a look.</i>

1250
01:04:54,424 --> 01:04:57,592
<i>As you can see, the new
status levels are: Safe.</i>

1251
01:04:57,594 --> 01:04:59,427
- Oh my goodness.
- <i>Really safe.</i>

1252
01:04:59,429 --> 01:05:00,729
- Doctor! Doctor!
<i>- Incredibly safe. Unbelievably safe.</i>

1253
01:05:00,731 --> 01:05:02,664
<i>- And not a fucking
care in the world.</i>

1254
01:05:04,801 --> 01:05:06,468
- My name is Dr. Jones.

1255
01:05:06,470 --> 01:05:09,170
I'm the comatose doctor
at mercy general.

1256
01:05:09,172 --> 01:05:10,338
- The comatose doctor?

1257
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,607
- Yes, I specialize
in comatose patients

1258
01:05:12,609 --> 01:05:14,276
- here at the hospital.
- <i>Okay.</i>

1259
01:05:14,278 --> 01:05:17,112
- I know this is going to come
as a bit of a shock, Ms. Miller,

1260
01:05:17,114 --> 01:05:19,247
but you've been in
a coma for two years.

1261
01:05:19,249 --> 01:05:20,448
- What?

1262
01:05:20,450 --> 01:05:22,417
- You've been in
a coma for two years.

1263
01:05:22,419 --> 01:05:23,518
- I don't understand.

1264
01:05:23,520 --> 01:05:25,453
- You've been in
a coma for two years.

1265
01:05:25,455 --> 01:05:26,621
If you'll excuse me.

1266
01:05:26,623 --> 01:05:28,456
- Wait.
Where are you going?

1267
01:05:28,458 --> 01:05:30,525
- I'll come back later
when I have more time,

1268
01:05:30,527 --> 01:05:32,827
but congratulations
are in order.

1269
01:05:32,829 --> 01:05:34,195
- Congratulations?

1270
01:05:34,197 --> 01:05:36,965
- We were planning on
removing your breathing tube

1271
01:05:36,967 --> 01:05:39,634
so it was a good thing that
you woke up when you did.

1272
01:05:39,636 --> 01:05:40,835
- My breathing tube?

1273
01:05:40,837 --> 01:05:42,871
- Yes, we were using
a breathing tube on you.

1274
01:05:42,873 --> 01:05:44,806
- Why?
- To help you breathe.

1275
01:05:44,808 --> 01:05:48,143
- But if you were removing it,
then that means, that...

1276
01:05:48,145 --> 01:05:49,544
- You wouldn't be able
to breathe.

1277
01:05:49,546 --> 01:05:50,812
- Why would you do that?

1278
01:05:50,814 --> 01:05:52,113
[Stomach gurgling
- you're out of money.

1279
01:05:52,115 --> 01:05:53,515
- I'm terribly sorry.
- What?

1280
01:05:53,517 --> 01:05:54,516
- I've got the runs.

1281
01:05:54,518 --> 01:05:56,151
I mean, I've got to run.
Excuse me.

1282
01:05:59,122 --> 01:06:01,022
- This is a joke.

1283
01:06:01,024 --> 01:06:03,725
- Oh no, no, this is not a joke.

1284
01:06:03,727 --> 01:06:04,960
- Why are you laughing?

1285
01:06:04,962 --> 01:06:06,328
- Because the doctor farted.

1286
01:06:06,330 --> 01:06:08,863
- Where is Lisa?
Why isn't she here?

1287
01:06:08,865 --> 01:06:10,565
- Ashley, listen.
You're in shock.

1288
01:06:10,567 --> 01:06:13,301
- Why did he say that
I didn't have any money.

1289
01:06:13,303 --> 01:06:15,303
- Well, you've been in the
hospital for two years.

1290
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:16,504
That's expensive.

1291
01:06:16,506 --> 01:06:18,239
- But I have insurance.

1292
01:06:18,241 --> 01:06:20,508
- Oh, you have to renew your
insurance every year now

1293
01:06:20,510 --> 01:06:21,343
and you didn't.

1294
01:06:21,345 --> 01:06:23,211
- But why didn't I do it?

1295
01:06:23,213 --> 01:06:24,713
- Well, you were in a coma.

1296
01:06:24,715 --> 01:06:26,848
- But I would still have money.

1297
01:06:26,850 --> 01:06:29,584
- No.
You lost everything.

1298
01:06:29,586 --> 01:06:32,754
- Wait, what about Lisa?
Where are my paintings?

1299
01:06:32,756 --> 01:06:36,191
- Lisa sold your paintings
to pay for the hospital bills.

1300
01:06:36,193 --> 01:06:38,693
- And then where did she go?

1301
01:06:38,695 --> 01:06:40,261
- Oh.

1302
01:06:43,199 --> 01:06:45,700
- Where did my baby go?

1303
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:52,173
My baby.

1304
01:06:52,842 --> 01:06:55,043
- I'm sorry.

1305
01:06:56,445 --> 01:06:58,880
- This can't be happening.

1306
01:06:59,615 --> 01:07:01,383
Please tell me
this isn't happening.

1307
01:07:01,385 --> 01:07:04,552
- Just, hold my hand.
- Okay.

1308
01:07:04,554 --> 01:07:07,022
- You just stood by me
all these years.

1309
01:07:07,024 --> 01:07:09,224
That's so nice.

1310
01:07:09,226 --> 01:07:13,028
- Yeah,
that's actually not true.

1311
01:07:13,030 --> 01:07:15,030
- What do you mean?

1312
01:07:15,032 --> 01:07:17,699
- I was just dropping off
a box of my comic books

1313
01:07:17,701 --> 01:07:19,134
to the children's ward,

1314
01:07:19,136 --> 01:07:20,568
and I was walking by this room,

1315
01:07:20,570 --> 01:07:22,270
and I saw you lying there
and I thought,

1316
01:07:22,272 --> 01:07:24,706
"oh yeah, Ashley's here.
I'll stop by."

1317
01:07:24,708 --> 01:07:27,442
And that's when you woke up.

1318
01:07:31,180 --> 01:07:34,249
- Wait.
You wrote a comic book.

1319
01:07:34,251 --> 01:07:35,750
- Yeah.

1320
01:07:35,752 --> 01:07:37,886
Can you believe it?

1321
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:47,595
It's a big success.

1322
01:07:47,597 --> 01:07:51,666
People all over the world
are reading it.

1323
01:07:51,668 --> 01:07:55,136
They're even adapting it
into a Hollywood movie.

1324
01:07:55,138 --> 01:07:57,505
You know, Ron Howard
wants to direct it

1325
01:07:57,507 --> 01:08:00,508
but I really want David lynch.

1326
01:08:13,089 --> 01:08:15,356
-<i> Veronica!</i>

1327
01:08:15,358 --> 01:08:17,325
<i>Veronica!</i>

1328
01:08:18,461 --> 01:08:20,662
<i>Veronica!</i>

1329
01:08:21,230 --> 01:08:23,431
<i>Veronica!</i>

1330
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:24,666
- Hey, I'm here.

1331
01:08:24,668 --> 01:08:26,167
- Are they here?

1332
01:08:26,169 --> 01:08:27,702
- No, aunt Charlie.
Not yet.

1333
01:08:27,704 --> 01:08:29,537
- They're coming.
I can feel it.

1334
01:08:29,539 --> 01:08:31,206
- I know.

1335
01:08:31,208 --> 01:08:33,975
- The tentacles are going
to rise up from the earth

1336
01:08:33,977 --> 01:08:35,677
and they're going to

1337
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:37,846
destroy all the wretched
souls in this place.

1338
01:08:37,848 --> 01:08:38,847
- I know, aunt Charlie,

1339
01:08:38,849 --> 01:08:41,182
but the tentacles
aren't here yet.

1340
01:08:42,418 --> 01:08:44,619
- If I go before they come.

1341
01:08:44,621 --> 01:08:46,287
You know what you're
supposed to do, Veronica.

1342
01:08:46,289 --> 01:08:47,789
- I know.

1343
01:08:47,957 --> 01:08:50,558
- Tell me, so I know.

1344
01:08:50,560 --> 01:08:52,694
- I'm going to bury you
in the garden.

1345
01:08:52,696 --> 01:08:54,496
- Bury me in the garden.
- I will.

1346
01:08:54,498 --> 01:08:56,364
- That way, Gia can consume me,

1347
01:08:56,366 --> 01:08:58,566
and then I'll be recycled
into the earth,

1348
01:08:58,568 --> 01:09:01,469
and I can be born again
as something else.

1349
01:09:01,471 --> 01:09:03,571
- Oh yes.
Our good friend Gia.

1350
01:09:03,573 --> 01:09:05,507
- The tentacles are coming.

1351
01:09:05,509 --> 01:09:07,142
They're coming.

1352
01:09:07,144 --> 01:09:08,710
- Oh.

1353
01:09:10,946 --> 01:09:12,347
- That's it.

1354
01:09:12,349 --> 01:09:13,515
See, you're doing great.

1355
01:09:13,517 --> 01:09:15,984
Just put one foot
in front of the other.

1356
01:09:15,986 --> 01:09:17,485
- Oh, is that how you walk?

1357
01:09:17,487 --> 01:09:19,020
- Put one foot
in front of the other.

1358
01:09:19,022 --> 01:09:21,322
- You remind me of someone
who was here a few years ago.

1359
01:09:21,324 --> 01:09:23,691
- Oh, my legs
feel like Linguini.

1360
01:09:23,693 --> 01:09:26,027
- I love Linguini.

1361
01:09:26,029 --> 01:09:28,062
You're doing great.
This is great.

1362
01:09:28,064 --> 01:09:29,197
- Okay.

1363
01:09:29,199 --> 01:09:30,999
- Alright, just a little...
Um...

1364
01:09:31,001 --> 01:09:32,100
- That's enough.

1365
01:09:32,102 --> 01:09:33,268
- Okay, you can't quit.

1366
01:09:33,270 --> 01:09:35,036
- I'm not quitting.

1367
01:09:35,038 --> 01:09:36,337
I'll do it again tomorrow.

1368
01:09:36,339 --> 01:09:38,273
- You won't be here
tomorrow, Ashley.

1369
01:09:38,275 --> 01:09:39,908
We've got to get you
walking out of here today.

1370
01:09:39,910 --> 01:09:41,509
- What are you... why?

1371
01:09:41,511 --> 01:09:43,278
- Because this is
a for-profit hospital,

1372
01:09:43,280 --> 01:09:44,913
not a charity.

1373
01:09:44,915 --> 01:09:46,614
So come on.
Al dente.

1374
01:09:46,616 --> 01:09:48,082
- Oh god.

1375
01:10:17,346 --> 01:10:20,315
<i>- Hey mom.
Uh, it's me.</i>

1376
01:10:20,317 --> 01:10:22,917
<i>And I started drawing again.</i>

1377
01:10:22,919 --> 01:10:25,987
<i>I do think
creativity is important.</i>

1378
01:10:25,989 --> 01:10:28,156
<i>There's a lot of artists
in this town</i>

1379
01:10:28,158 --> 01:10:30,959
<i>and I love it here.</i>

1380
01:10:33,262 --> 01:10:35,597
- Wow, this is a nice place.

1381
01:10:35,599 --> 01:10:38,800
- Yeah, it's pretty small.

1382
01:10:38,802 --> 01:10:41,069
I'm thinking of buying
a place in bushwick.

1383
01:10:41,071 --> 01:10:42,804
- Yeah?

1384
01:10:43,105 --> 01:10:45,340
You make that much money
on a comic book, huh?

1385
01:10:45,342 --> 01:10:46,474
- Well, yeah.

1386
01:10:46,476 --> 01:10:48,943
I mean, I sold the
rights to Hollywood.

1387
01:10:48,945 --> 01:10:50,979
I got really lucky.

1388
01:10:53,082 --> 01:10:57,619
- I appreciate you
letting me stay here.

1389
01:10:57,621 --> 01:11:01,022
- I feel so bad about
what happened to you.

1390
01:11:01,024 --> 01:11:02,924
But you can paint in my studio,

1391
01:11:02,926 --> 01:11:05,093
and you'll be back on
your feet in no time.

1392
01:11:05,095 --> 01:11:07,462
- You have a studio?

1393
01:11:07,464 --> 01:11:10,798
- Yeah, it's the same
studio that you used.

1394
01:11:12,935 --> 01:11:14,836
- Huh.

1395
01:11:15,204 --> 01:11:17,805
- Do you want some water?

1396
01:11:17,807 --> 01:11:19,340
- Do you want something to eat?
- No. No. No.

1397
01:11:19,342 --> 01:11:20,775
Thanks. No.

1398
01:11:20,777 --> 01:11:22,877
- Do you want some milk?
- I'm good.

1399
01:11:23,879 --> 01:11:26,614
- Do you want a cheese sandwich?
- I just want a little sleep.

1400
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:54,175
- This is Sam.

1401
01:11:54,177 --> 01:11:55,476
- You name your tree?

1402
01:11:55,478 --> 01:11:56,878
- Yeah, of course.

1403
01:11:56,880 --> 01:11:59,881
This is Veronica, my niece.

1404
01:11:59,883 --> 01:12:01,849
Say "hello" to Sam.

1405
01:12:02,651 --> 01:12:04,652
- Hello, Sam.

1406
01:12:04,654 --> 01:12:06,654
- She's nice.

1407
01:12:06,656 --> 01:12:09,157
Oh, you're so beautiful.

1408
01:12:09,159 --> 01:12:11,693
Isn't it a beautiful day?

1409
01:12:14,530 --> 01:12:16,698
He's a good tree.

1410
01:12:16,700 --> 01:12:19,033
That's Bernie, he's an oak.

1411
01:12:19,035 --> 01:12:21,669
Sweet and grounded.

1412
01:12:21,671 --> 01:12:23,037
That's hilary.

1413
01:12:23,039 --> 01:12:26,574
Strong but
a little untrustworthy.

1414
01:12:27,209 --> 01:12:29,344
Ah, that's Donald.

1415
01:12:29,346 --> 01:12:31,245
He's an asshole.

1416
01:12:56,372 --> 01:12:58,406
- Ashley, it's just nerves.

1417
01:12:58,408 --> 01:13:01,075
- Oh yeah, I'm sure.

1418
01:13:01,077 --> 01:13:04,379
- You just need to ease
your way back into it.

1419
01:13:04,381 --> 01:13:06,047
- Yep.

1420
01:13:06,049 --> 01:13:08,449
- Maybe you could help me
draw my comic in the meantime.

1421
01:13:08,451 --> 01:13:11,152
- Oh, I don't think so.
I don't think I could do that.

1422
01:13:11,154 --> 01:13:12,253
- Sure you could.

1423
01:13:12,255 --> 01:13:16,557
- Your line work
is really... precise.

1424
01:13:16,559 --> 01:13:18,059
I don't think
I could do that anymore.

1425
01:13:18,061 --> 01:13:20,428
- There's no mustard in this.

1426
01:13:23,365 --> 01:13:25,500
Aw, they forgot the mustard?

1427
01:13:25,502 --> 01:13:29,103
I don't like to eat Turkey
without mustard.

1428
01:13:29,105 --> 01:13:32,440
In my comic book, the happy
blue bunnies love mustard.

1429
01:13:32,442 --> 01:13:36,277
- That's fuckin'...
That's... that's so cute.

1430
01:13:36,279 --> 01:13:39,747
- Did you get a chance
to read it yet?

1431
01:13:39,749 --> 01:13:45,987
- Oh... I...
I want to so bad.

1432
01:13:45,989 --> 01:13:48,790
- Ashley,
will you do me a favor?

1433
01:13:50,025 --> 01:13:53,127
- Will you run out
and get me some mustard?

1434
01:13:54,763 --> 01:13:57,131
<i>- Aunt Charlie,
I made you an omelette.</i>

1435
01:13:59,735 --> 01:14:01,803
Aunt Charlie?

1436
01:14:02,738 --> 01:14:04,972
It's time to wake up.

1437
01:14:07,709 --> 01:14:09,710
Charlie?

1438
01:14:13,315 --> 01:14:15,383
Charlie, get up.

1439
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,219
Wake up.
Wake up...

1440
01:14:18,221 --> 01:14:20,321
There you are.

1441
01:14:20,323 --> 01:14:21,556
You can sleep through anything.

1442
01:14:21,558 --> 01:14:23,524
- Why do you do that?
It's so jarring.

1443
01:14:23,526 --> 01:14:25,226
- You were lying so still,

1444
01:14:25,228 --> 01:14:27,128
I just wanted to make
sure you weren't dead.

1445
01:14:27,130 --> 01:14:28,563
- Of course my body is still.

1446
01:14:28,565 --> 01:14:30,298
What do you expect me
to do when I'm sleeping?

1447
01:14:30,300 --> 01:14:31,699
Calisthenics?

1448
01:14:31,701 --> 01:14:34,802
- Well, it's a beautiful day.

1449
01:14:34,804 --> 01:14:36,471
We should go outside.

1450
01:14:36,473 --> 01:14:40,208
- Rest is good for the body.

1451
01:14:40,210 --> 01:14:41,709
What are you
trying to do, kill me?

1452
01:14:41,711 --> 01:14:43,845
- Of course not, aunt Charlie.
I just...

1453
01:14:43,847 --> 01:14:45,847
- Then why are you
trying to get me up?

1454
01:14:45,849 --> 01:14:48,216
I'm trying to sleep.

1455
01:14:49,818 --> 01:14:53,054
- It's just that I realized
today is kip's birthday.

1456
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:13,541
- Are you okay?
- I need some air.

1457
01:15:13,543 --> 01:15:15,743
- Can you get me
a seltzer when you're out?

1458
01:15:17,679 --> 01:15:19,247
- Fuck.

1459
01:15:20,148 --> 01:15:24,752
Fucking seltzer.
Fucking shit.

1460
01:15:24,754 --> 01:15:27,388
Ah, shit.

1461
01:15:33,662 --> 01:15:35,696
Wow.

1462
01:15:36,498 --> 01:15:38,933
- Sally told me you were here.
I can't believe it.

1463
01:15:38,935 --> 01:15:41,135
- I can't believe it's you.

1464
01:15:41,137 --> 01:15:42,904
Wow.

1465
01:15:44,973 --> 01:15:46,741
Whoa.

1466
01:15:48,243 --> 01:15:50,044
Is that yours?

1467
01:15:50,046 --> 01:15:52,547
- He is, yeah.
He is.

1468
01:15:52,549 --> 01:15:54,382
His name's Ben.

1469
01:15:55,317 --> 01:15:57,285
- Hey, Ben.

1470
01:15:58,654 --> 01:16:03,591
Wow. He's a really,
really beautiful... baby.

1471
01:16:03,593 --> 01:16:05,092
Whoo.

1472
01:16:05,094 --> 01:16:07,295
- I'm sorry, Ashley.

1473
01:16:10,198 --> 01:16:13,134
I didn't know if you
were ever going to wake up.

1474
01:16:13,136 --> 01:16:15,570
- Yeah.
Yeah, I know.

1475
01:16:15,572 --> 01:16:16,938
- And I didn't have any money

1476
01:16:16,940 --> 01:16:19,907
and I still don't have
any money but...

1477
01:16:19,909 --> 01:16:21,909
- I met someone.
- Oh, good,

1478
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:24,111
- good, that's good.

1479
01:16:25,180 --> 01:16:27,615
So, what's she like?

1480
01:16:28,684 --> 01:16:30,518
- He's nice.

1481
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:32,453
- Oh.

1482
01:16:33,689 --> 01:16:35,690
- I brought this for you.

1483
01:16:35,692 --> 01:16:36,824
Yeah, I know.

1484
01:16:36,826 --> 01:16:39,026
You want to go home, I know.

1485
01:16:39,028 --> 01:16:42,330
- What is it?
- It's just some things I saved.

1486
01:16:46,568 --> 01:16:49,036
- Anyway,
it was nice to see you.

1487
01:16:49,038 --> 01:16:51,339
I've got to go.

1488
01:16:53,041 --> 01:16:55,443
I'm glad you're okay.

1489
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:01,782
I know, baby.
I know.

1490
01:17:13,228 --> 01:17:15,296
- Why the hell did he join?

1491
01:17:16,098 --> 01:17:17,732
- I don't know.

1492
01:17:17,734 --> 01:17:20,234
He believed he was
making a difference.

1493
01:17:20,236 --> 01:17:22,069
- So naive.

1494
01:17:22,071 --> 01:17:23,537
They think they're
fighting for a cause

1495
01:17:23,539 --> 01:17:25,806
and they're really fighting
for the defense industry.

1496
01:17:25,808 --> 01:17:28,142
Young people...
They're so stupid.

1497
01:17:28,144 --> 01:17:30,077
- Oh my god, I love this one.

1498
01:17:30,079 --> 01:17:32,146
- Oh.

1499
01:17:33,248 --> 01:17:34,815
- His glasses.

1500
01:17:34,817 --> 01:17:38,352
- We live in a society
that doesn't value life,

1501
01:17:38,354 --> 01:17:40,321
the earth.

1502
01:17:40,323 --> 01:17:42,089
Just money.

1503
01:17:42,091 --> 01:17:43,357
Adults are so stupid.

1504
01:17:43,359 --> 01:17:45,092
- Okay, well, if the young
people are stupid

1505
01:17:45,094 --> 01:17:46,360
and the adults are stupid,

1506
01:17:46,362 --> 01:17:48,162
who are we supposed to turn to?

1507
01:17:48,164 --> 01:17:49,263
The babies?

1508
01:17:49,265 --> 01:17:51,699
- Yes, the babies.
Exactly.

1509
01:17:51,701 --> 01:17:53,601
- You're not serious.

1510
01:17:53,603 --> 01:17:55,503
Of course, you're serious.

1511
01:17:55,505 --> 01:17:56,737
- You know why?

1512
01:17:56,739 --> 01:17:59,573
Because babies,
as soon as they're conceived,

1513
01:17:59,575 --> 01:18:03,411
all they are
concerned with is life.

1514
01:18:03,413 --> 01:18:06,180
Like the earth, like kudzu.

1515
01:18:06,182 --> 01:18:08,449
Developing... growing.

1516
01:18:08,451 --> 01:18:11,185
- Kudzu is a parasite.

1517
01:18:11,687 --> 01:18:13,421
- Ashley.

1518
01:18:17,793 --> 01:18:19,860
Ashley.

1519
01:18:20,362 --> 01:18:22,063
Wake up.
It's time to wake up.

1520
01:18:22,065 --> 01:18:25,266
- Can I just... can I just
sleep a little bit longer?

1521
01:18:25,268 --> 01:18:26,801
- But you've been
sleeping so much.

1522
01:18:26,803 --> 01:18:28,736
I'm getting worried about you.

1523
01:18:28,738 --> 01:18:32,239
- No, no, no, no.
I'm just tired, that's all.

1524
01:18:32,241 --> 01:18:35,643
- Do you want to go to my bed and sleep?
- No.

1525
01:18:35,645 --> 01:18:36,444
- I don't know.

1526
01:18:36,446 --> 01:18:37,945
Why?
Am I in the way?

1527
01:18:37,947 --> 01:18:39,947
- No, no, you're not.

1528
01:18:39,949 --> 01:18:42,316
Just make yourself at home.

1529
01:18:42,318 --> 01:18:46,754
Um... but, I have to go
to the studio, so...

1530
01:18:46,756 --> 01:18:48,656
Well, I have a lot
of work to do.

1531
01:18:48,658 --> 01:18:51,392
Um, but I'll see you
when I get back.

1532
01:18:53,161 --> 01:18:54,495
- Sally.

1533
01:18:54,497 --> 01:18:55,930
- Yeah.

1534
01:18:57,833 --> 01:19:00,634
- I'm sorry for
how I treated you.

1535
01:19:00,636 --> 01:19:04,171
- Oh, you don't need
to apologize.

1536
01:19:05,340 --> 01:19:08,008
- No, I was a real bitch.

1537
01:19:09,177 --> 01:19:10,444
- Well, sometimes.

1538
01:19:10,446 --> 01:19:14,115
But it actually motivated me.

1539
01:19:14,117 --> 01:19:15,649
- Really?
- Yeah.

1540
01:19:15,651 --> 01:19:18,786
- I mean, humiliation
can cripple some people

1541
01:19:18,788 --> 01:19:22,990
- but it made me work harder.
- Mmm.

1542
01:19:22,992 --> 01:19:25,426
- So, you didn't hate me.

1543
01:19:26,361 --> 01:19:27,928
- Of course.

1544
01:19:27,930 --> 01:19:33,701
But, sometimes,
the best revenge is success.

1545
01:19:33,703 --> 01:19:36,103
- So, why are you
helping me then.

1546
01:19:38,540 --> 01:19:40,274
- I'm not.

1547
01:19:40,276 --> 01:19:43,477
I'm taking great joy
in seeing you like this.

1548
01:19:43,479 --> 01:19:46,046
I mean, your life is over.

1549
01:19:46,048 --> 01:19:47,348
You can't paint.

1550
01:19:47,350 --> 01:19:48,783
You lost your girlfriend.

1551
01:19:48,785 --> 01:19:51,051
You lost your baby.

1552
01:19:57,959 --> 01:19:59,960
- Ugh.

1553
01:22:05,720 --> 01:22:08,622
- What are you doing here?

1554
01:22:08,624 --> 01:22:11,692
- We have some
unfinished business.

1555
01:22:11,694 --> 01:22:13,861
- Well, that's so dramatic.

1556
01:22:14,195 --> 01:22:16,096
- I lost everything
because of you.

1557
01:22:16,098 --> 01:22:17,197
- That's even more dramatic.

1558
01:22:17,199 --> 01:22:18,799
- It's true.

1559
01:22:21,703 --> 01:22:23,170
- I lost everything
because of you.

1560
01:22:23,172 --> 01:22:26,140
- Well, it looks like
you're doing okay now.

1561
01:22:31,947 --> 01:22:33,847
- Do you want a glass of water?
You look dehydrated.

1562
01:22:33,849 --> 01:22:36,684
- I didn't come here
to make peace, Veronica.

1563
01:22:38,219 --> 01:22:39,787
- How did you find me?

1564
01:22:39,789 --> 01:22:40,821
- Instinct.

1565
01:22:40,823 --> 01:22:42,189
- I'm not buying it.

1566
01:22:42,191 --> 01:22:43,791
- I followed your smell.
- I'm still not buying it.

1567
01:22:43,793 --> 01:22:46,694
- I found your bus ticket
from two years ago.

1568
01:22:48,063 --> 01:22:49,964
- I'll buy that.

1569
01:22:58,807 --> 01:23:00,240
We don't have to
do this, Ashley.

1570
01:23:00,242 --> 01:23:02,743
- My spirit's broken.

1571
01:23:02,745 --> 01:23:05,212
My heart is filled with hate.

1572
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:10,517
I have nothing left to do
in this life but destroy you.

1573
01:23:12,253 --> 01:23:13,420
- Well, why don't you come in

1574
01:23:13,422 --> 01:23:15,856
and I'll make you
some breakfast first.

1575
01:23:17,325 --> 01:23:19,426
- I haven't eaten.

1576
01:23:21,029 --> 01:23:23,597
- Come on.
I'll make you an omelette.

1577
01:23:24,199 --> 01:23:26,100
You love omelettes.

1578
01:23:27,469 --> 01:23:29,770
- You remembered.

1579
01:23:32,173 --> 01:23:34,008
- Come on.

1580
01:23:39,814 --> 01:23:41,882
- How old was he?

1581
01:23:43,618 --> 01:23:46,086
- He would have been
19 yesterday.

1582
01:23:47,055 --> 01:23:49,223
- Mine would have been two.

1583
01:23:50,358 --> 01:23:52,426
One and a half, I suppose.

1584
01:23:56,231 --> 01:23:58,399
- I would have never
let kip enlist.

1585
01:23:58,401 --> 01:24:00,267
I would have stopped him.

1586
01:24:00,269 --> 01:24:02,536
But I couldn't.

1587
01:24:02,538 --> 01:24:04,638
I was asleep.

1588
01:24:06,574 --> 01:24:08,976
- You didn't think
the war was right?

1589
01:24:09,577 --> 01:24:11,745
- I never really thought
about it being right or wrong.

1590
01:24:11,747 --> 01:24:14,815
It just made us rich.

1591
01:24:16,584 --> 01:24:18,819
- It put me on the map.

1592
01:24:23,425 --> 01:24:25,993
- God, I miss
buying things though.

1593
01:24:28,063 --> 01:24:29,463
- This seems like
a pretty good option,

1594
01:24:29,465 --> 01:24:31,398
dropping out of everything.

1595
01:24:31,400 --> 01:24:33,133
- Yeah, you know,
I never thought I'd love

1596
01:24:33,135 --> 01:24:34,568
living in a place so remote.

1597
01:24:34,570 --> 01:24:36,737
I could never live
in the city again.

1598
01:24:38,440 --> 01:24:40,340
- You don't get lonely?

1599
01:24:44,546 --> 01:24:46,613
- Actually, no.

1600
01:24:47,949 --> 01:24:49,850
- Hmm.

1601
01:24:50,118 --> 01:24:51,652
- This is my aunt's place.

1602
01:24:51,654 --> 01:24:53,020
She's sleeping in the back room.

1603
01:24:53,022 --> 01:24:54,288
- Wait, she's here?

1604
01:24:54,290 --> 01:24:56,690
- Oh, she could sleep
through an apocalypse.

1605
01:24:56,692 --> 01:24:58,659
No, I'm really
lucky to have her.

1606
01:24:58,661 --> 01:25:01,495
She's my last living relative.

1607
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:10,704
Do you want to see my son?

1608
01:25:15,710 --> 01:25:18,178
- Sure.

1609
01:25:37,999 --> 01:25:39,967
- He made these videos for me

1610
01:25:39,969 --> 01:25:42,069
when he was in the war.

1611
01:25:49,010 --> 01:25:51,078
- Wow, what a gift.

1612
01:25:51,179 --> 01:25:53,313
- Yeah, here.

1613
01:26:03,024 --> 01:26:04,491
-<i> Hey, mom</i>.

1614
01:26:04,493 --> 01:26:06,727
<i>Um, I hope you're well
and getting a lot of rest.</i>

1615
01:26:06,729 --> 01:26:08,195
<i>That was a joke.</i>

1616
01:26:08,197 --> 01:26:10,664
<i>Um, I actually met this girl
a couple of weeks ago.</i>

1617
01:26:10,666 --> 01:26:14,067
<i>Um, she's beautiful and amazing</i>

1618
01:26:14,069 --> 01:26:16,670
<i>and we've been hanging out a lot</i>

1619
01:26:16,672 --> 01:26:17,905
<i>and going on walks and stuff.</i>

1620
01:26:17,907 --> 01:26:19,006
<i>She doesn't really speak
that much English</i>

1621
01:26:19,008 --> 01:26:20,107
<i>but I'm teaching her.</i>

1622
01:26:20,109 --> 01:26:21,441
-<i> So, she...</i>

1623
01:26:24,279 --> 01:26:26,580
- He's so handsome.

1624
01:26:26,582 --> 01:26:28,515
- Isn't he?

1625
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:47,434
I was so angry for so long.

1626
01:26:51,806 --> 01:26:53,974
But these videos have...

1627
01:26:55,143 --> 01:26:56,877
Have saved me.

1628
01:26:56,879 --> 01:26:58,645
It's like...

1629
01:27:00,148 --> 01:27:02,649
It's like he's still
here with me.

1630
01:27:12,795 --> 01:27:14,294
- Oh shit. Oh shit.

1631
01:27:14,296 --> 01:27:15,829
- Hold on. Hold on.
- Oh my god. Oh my god.

1632
01:27:15,831 --> 01:27:16,964
- Give me that...
Give me that napkin.

1633
01:27:16,966 --> 01:27:18,065
Please, please, please.

1634
01:27:18,067 --> 01:27:19,967
- Dry it... dry it off.
- Oh shit.

1635
01:27:19,969 --> 01:27:22,402
- Oh shit.
- Oh my god, it's going to be fine.

1636
01:27:22,404 --> 01:27:23,437
- Oh my god, it's not working.

1637
01:27:23,439 --> 01:27:25,172
- Veronica,
it's going to be fine.

1638
01:27:25,174 --> 01:27:27,307
- Oh my god, it's not fucking working.
- It's going to be fine!

1639
01:27:27,309 --> 01:27:29,309
- You broke it!
- I didn't break...

1640
01:27:29,311 --> 01:27:32,512
- Ashley, you fucking broke it.
- Look, it's playing! It's playing!

1641
01:27:36,851 --> 01:27:38,852
- You broke it.
You fucking broke it.

1642
01:27:38,854 --> 01:27:40,854
- It was an accident, Veronica.

1643
01:27:40,856 --> 01:27:41,955
There's water spilled...

1644
01:27:41,957 --> 01:27:43,490
- Why are you
drinking water near it?

1645
01:27:43,492 --> 01:27:45,325
- What are you talking about?
You put it on the table!

1646
01:27:45,327 --> 01:27:46,994
- This is all I have.

1647
01:27:46,996 --> 01:27:48,862
- What?
- Ashley.

1648
01:27:48,864 --> 01:27:50,864
- You backed them up?

1649
01:27:50,866 --> 01:27:52,666
- Oh, come on.
- No, I didn't back it up!

1650
01:27:52,668 --> 01:27:55,102
- Surely, you backed up your son's videos!
- How?

1651
01:27:55,104 --> 01:27:56,970
- How? Where are we?
- What are you talking about?

1652
01:27:56,972 --> 01:27:59,539
- Put it on the cloud!
- I'm in the middle of a fucking cabin.

1653
01:27:59,541 --> 01:28:01,441
- Oh my god, are you serious?

1654
01:28:01,443 --> 01:28:03,777
- You didn't back up those fucking videos?
- No, I didn't back it up.

1655
01:28:03,779 --> 01:28:05,012
- How many times
do I have to tell you!

1656
01:28:05,014 --> 01:28:06,647
- I didn't...
- Do not fucking blame me

1657
01:28:06,649 --> 01:28:08,649
- for your stupid
fucking mistake!

1658
01:28:08,651 --> 01:28:10,217
- Blame you?

1659
01:28:10,219 --> 01:28:13,553
You are killing my son
all over again.

1660
01:28:26,167 --> 01:28:28,001
- You bitch!

1661
01:28:33,241 --> 01:28:34,908
- Uh.

1662
01:29:04,505 --> 01:29:06,006
- Fuck you!

1663
01:29:07,175 --> 01:29:10,210
Get up.
Get up bitch!

1664
01:30:01,863 --> 01:30:03,230
- Uh.

1665
01:30:24,352 --> 01:30:25,986
Ugh.

1666
01:30:35,797 --> 01:30:37,297
Ah!

1667
01:30:46,741 --> 01:30:48,375
- Fuck you!

1668
01:31:05,493 --> 01:31:08,128
- Look at me!
Look at me!

1669
01:32:36,751 --> 01:32:40,220
- <i>System reboot. System reboot.</i>

1670
01:32:40,222 --> 01:32:43,123
<i>System reboot. System reboot.</i>

1671
01:32:48,062 --> 01:32:51,097
<i>- I was on this mountain
yesterday</i>

1672
01:32:51,099 --> 01:32:53,099
<i>and I took this landscape,
I drew this landscape,</i>

1673
01:32:53,101 --> 01:32:55,769
<i>and I thought it was
so peaceful and beautiful</i>

1674
01:32:55,771 --> 01:32:58,271
<i>and I just wanted to show it
to you because it was so...</i>

1675
01:33:02,877 --> 01:33:05,645
<i>Um, I think I need to go.</i>

1676
01:33:07,381 --> 01:33:08,682
<i>Wake up soon.</i>

1677
01:33:08,684 --> 01:33:10,083
<i>I love you, mom.</i>
