00:15:02,340 --> 00:15:05,546
Okay, yeah, I have
one in the cellar.

171
00:15:24,340 --> 00:15:25,739
Whose house is this?

172
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:29,025
It's my grandma and
grandpa's house.

173
00:15:29,580 --> 00:15:32,979
- Where are they?
- Oh, uh, my grandpa has leukemia,

174
00:15:32,980 --> 00:15:36,979
so he's at Dallas at the hospital.

175
00:15:36,980 --> 00:15:39,659
Grandma's with him, but...

176
00:15:39,660 --> 00:15:43,899
- They're probably dead by now.
- (BRAD TITTERING) I'm sorry.

177
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:47,779
I'm just kidding. They're
dead! That's for sure.

178
00:15:47,780 --> 00:15:50,064
Could you stop being
an asshole and dig?

179
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:57,947

180
00:16:00,900 --> 00:16:02,786

182
00:16:04,780 --> 00:16:06,299
He's our neighbor.

183
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:11,139
They don't have a cellar, because a lot
of people around here don't have cellars.

184
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,584

any more up here.

189
00:16:44,140 --> 00:16:45,499
About seven months.

190
00:16:45,500 --> 00:16:49,263
A little more than that.
Like eleven days or so.

I put my mp3 player in the safe so that
we at least have some music to listen to.

how widespread the radiation is.
