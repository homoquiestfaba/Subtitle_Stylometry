1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,022
(wicked music)

2
00:00:11,878 --> 00:00:13,890
(thunder booms)

3
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:15,105
- Dear Heavenly Father,

4
00:00:15,105 --> 00:00:17,502
I pray in the power of the Holy Spirit

5
00:00:17,502 --> 00:00:20,643
in the name of Jesus Christ.

6
00:00:20,643 --> 00:00:22,754
No weapon formed against me shall prosper,

7
00:00:22,754 --> 00:00:25,828
for I wear the full armor of God.

8
00:00:25,828 --> 00:00:29,191
I declare that Satan is
beneath me and shall remain so.

9
00:00:29,191 --> 00:00:33,150
I ask that his angels protect
this town and these brave men.

10
00:00:33,150 --> 00:00:36,212
In the name of Jesus Christ, amen.

11
00:00:36,212 --> 00:00:39,480
(vampire cries out)

12
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:41,455
(vampire coughs)

13
00:00:41,455 --> 00:00:42,288
(thunder booms)

14
00:00:42,288 --> 00:00:44,705
(evil music)

15
00:01:02,983 --> 00:01:03,816
- Hello?

16
00:01:06,917 --> 00:01:08,034
Hello?

17
00:01:08,034 --> 00:01:09,117
That dude at the antique shop

18
00:01:09,117 --> 00:01:11,543
said meet behind the
Devil's Dune at midnight.

19
00:01:11,543 --> 00:01:12,376
Hello?

20
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:14,183
- Yes.

21
00:01:16,578 --> 00:01:17,411
I am here.

22
00:01:19,751 --> 00:01:22,050
- I got it, a human tooth.

23
00:01:22,050 --> 00:01:23,383
- Show it to me.

24
00:01:27,793 --> 00:01:30,269
How long has it been in your family?

25
00:01:30,269 --> 00:01:32,313
- God, a long time,

26
00:01:32,313 --> 00:01:33,980
since 1897, I think.

27
00:01:35,894 --> 00:01:38,747
My grandfather got it
from my great-grandfather.

28
00:01:38,747 --> 00:01:39,997
- May I see it?

29
00:01:43,767 --> 00:01:45,773
- [Young Man] It's bound with silver wire,

30
00:01:45,773 --> 00:01:49,229
hung from a length of black sinew.

31
00:01:49,229 --> 00:01:50,619
It's just what you asked about, man.

32
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:53,202
(creepy music)

33
00:01:58,564 --> 00:01:59,647
- This is it.

34
00:02:03,584 --> 00:02:06,167
- That means you'll pay me now?

35
00:02:08,583 --> 00:02:11,428
- Do you understand that
this goes far beyond money

36
00:02:11,428 --> 00:02:12,961
and family?

37
00:02:12,961 --> 00:02:15,001
- Yeah, whatever, dude, that's
between you and your tooth.

38
00:02:15,001 --> 00:02:16,058
I just wanna get paid.

39
00:02:16,058 --> 00:02:18,725
(ominous music)

40
00:02:39,517 --> 00:02:40,684
So we're cool?

41
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:44,413
- No.

42
00:02:44,413 --> 00:02:45,330
We are not.

43
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:49,703
(young man screams)

44
00:02:49,703 --> 00:02:52,703
(suspenseful music)

45
00:02:54,813 --> 00:02:57,730
(vampire growling)

46
00:03:02,973 --> 00:03:04,413
- Slick bastard.

47
00:03:04,413 --> 00:03:05,988
You beat me to him, didn't you?

48
00:03:05,988 --> 00:03:08,488
(eerie music)

49
00:03:42,136 --> 00:03:42,969
- Wow.

50
00:04:01,013 --> 00:04:03,096
What in the hell is this?

51
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:10,133
- You had to go and turn
archaeologists on me, didn't you?

52
00:04:10,133 --> 00:04:12,693
- This is supposed to be
a restoration, isn't it?

53
00:04:12,693 --> 00:04:14,276
Look at this cross.

54
00:04:16,011 --> 00:04:17,011
This is old.

55
00:04:18,613 --> 00:04:20,246
Older than this church.

56
00:04:20,246 --> 00:04:22,795
Looks like it was brought
in from some other site.

57
00:04:22,795 --> 00:04:24,712
And this, what is this?

58
00:04:25,790 --> 00:04:27,197
- That would be a stick.

59
00:04:27,197 --> 00:04:28,030
Look.

60
00:04:28,030 --> 00:04:31,080
Restoration is a new route
from these sewer pipes.

61
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:33,032
This is an interruption.

62
00:04:33,032 --> 00:04:34,817
If we have to start
digging around this thing,

63
00:04:34,817 --> 00:04:35,794
it's not gonna cost you,

64
00:04:35,794 --> 00:04:36,776
it's gonna cost me.

65
00:04:36,776 --> 00:04:38,714
- What was I supposed to do, ignore it,

66
00:04:38,714 --> 00:04:42,682
just wait for it to crawl
out on its own and walk away?

67
00:04:42,682 --> 00:04:43,515
- It's late.

68
00:04:43,515 --> 00:04:45,445
Look, we'll call the
church in the morning.

69
00:04:45,445 --> 00:04:48,997
They're probably gonna wanna
send somebody out here now.

70
00:04:48,997 --> 00:04:50,590
Thanks a lot for all this.

71
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:52,090
Let's get out of here.

72
00:04:52,090 --> 00:04:54,341
- I don't know why you're mad at me.

73
00:04:54,341 --> 00:04:55,824
It's not my fault.

74
00:04:55,824 --> 00:04:58,407
(creepy music)

75
00:05:12,731 --> 00:05:15,398
(thunder booms)

76
00:06:30,064 --> 00:06:33,064
(church bell tolls)

77
00:06:48,108 --> 00:06:50,775
(ominous music)

78
00:07:29,090 --> 00:07:32,340
(knocking on the door)

79
00:07:54,119 --> 00:07:56,452
(sad music)

80
00:08:46,264 --> 00:08:49,181
(foreboding music)

81
00:09:43,371 --> 00:09:46,538
♫ Fire fire fire fire

82
00:09:47,419 --> 00:09:51,419
♫ How could you treat me so bad

83
00:09:56,198 --> 00:09:58,948
♫ Fire fire fire

84
00:10:00,120 --> 00:10:04,120
♫ How could you treat me so bad

85
00:10:06,086 --> 00:10:09,003
(mysterious music)

86
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:14,440
(clanging and clattering)

87
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,341
- Shoot!

88
00:11:15,341 --> 00:11:16,174
Shoot!

89
00:11:18,717 --> 00:11:21,634
Damn, girl, what you doing in here?

90
00:11:23,432 --> 00:11:25,896
Wait wait wait wait wait
now, don't get upset!

91
00:11:25,896 --> 00:11:28,553
(girl groans)

92
00:11:28,553 --> 00:11:32,060
Oh whoa, girl, wait, it's all right.

93
00:11:32,060 --> 00:11:33,640
Look, you can keep that coat,

94
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:38,144
because obviously you
need it more than I do.

95
00:11:38,144 --> 00:11:40,727
Look, I ain't gonna do nothing.

96
00:11:41,587 --> 00:11:43,504
Just give me my wallet.

97
00:11:47,225 --> 00:11:48,058
That's all I want.

98
00:11:48,058 --> 00:11:50,525
It's right there in the pocket.

99
00:11:50,525 --> 00:11:52,525
Just give me the wallet.

100
00:11:57,708 --> 00:12:00,305
♫ Take all my money too woman

101
00:12:00,305 --> 00:12:04,472
(laughs) Yeah, see stuff like
this, this hard to come by,

102
00:12:05,395 --> 00:12:08,232
credit cards, driver's license.

103
00:12:08,232 --> 00:12:11,155
(laughs) Shoot, I'd be
down at the DMV all day.

104
00:12:11,155 --> 00:12:12,488
Can't have that.

105
00:12:15,867 --> 00:12:18,725
Damn, you was hungry, girl.

106
00:12:18,725 --> 00:12:20,142
It's okay though.

107
00:12:21,408 --> 00:12:22,658
You got a name?

108
00:12:27,188 --> 00:12:29,271
Can't remember your name.

109
00:12:32,745 --> 00:12:34,370
Can you remember anything?

110
00:12:34,370 --> 00:12:36,870
(eerie music)

111
00:12:42,387 --> 00:12:44,029
It's hard to talk.

112
00:12:44,029 --> 00:12:47,741
Look like somebody done
messed up your neck.

113
00:12:47,741 --> 00:12:49,574
Can you write it down?

114
00:12:50,731 --> 00:12:51,976
Yeah?

115
00:12:51,976 --> 00:12:52,809
Okay.

116
00:12:55,507 --> 00:12:56,757
How about that?

117
00:12:57,833 --> 00:12:58,833
Here you go.

118
00:13:02,547 --> 00:13:05,181
Okay, you don't like the pen.

119
00:13:05,181 --> 00:13:06,764
How about a pencil?

120
00:13:07,645 --> 00:13:09,078
Okay.

121
00:13:09,078 --> 00:13:11,911
You must've went to public school.

122
00:13:16,307 --> 00:13:17,307
Main Street.

123
00:13:18,493 --> 00:13:19,933
You gonna have to be a
little bit more specific.

124
00:13:19,933 --> 00:13:23,516
There's Main Street
North, there's Midtown.

125
00:13:26,582 --> 00:13:29,433
Oh you mean Main Street in Old Town.

126
00:13:29,433 --> 00:13:31,408
Yeah, that's by the riverfront.

127
00:13:31,408 --> 00:13:32,241
That's west.

128
00:13:32,241 --> 00:13:34,324
Wait wait wait wait wait!

129
00:13:35,403 --> 00:13:36,236
Hold on.

130
00:13:36,236 --> 00:13:39,319
(strange dark music)

131
00:13:51,742 --> 00:13:53,389
Okay.

132
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:54,854
All right now, eat up.

133
00:13:54,854 --> 00:13:56,192
You probably need to get you some iron,

134
00:13:56,192 --> 00:13:59,025
because you looking a little pale.

135
00:14:07,688 --> 00:14:10,605
(mysterious music)

136
00:14:38,703 --> 00:14:39,536
- Hey!

137
00:14:41,445 --> 00:14:42,778
Where you going?

138
00:14:47,994 --> 00:14:52,161
(sirens whirring in the distance)

139
00:15:06,333 --> 00:15:07,416
Kind of late.

140
00:15:11,276 --> 00:15:13,239
Want to bunk here tonight?

141
00:15:13,239 --> 00:15:16,489
I got some blankets and I got a pillow.

142
00:15:18,231 --> 00:15:21,564
I got blankets and we could make a spot,

143
00:15:23,502 --> 00:15:24,335
get warm,

144
00:15:26,177 --> 00:15:27,844
get some real sleep.

145
00:15:32,045 --> 00:15:34,045
What you got in the bag?

146
00:15:43,969 --> 00:15:46,302
Smells good, whatever it is.

147
00:15:49,398 --> 00:15:50,398
Wanna share?

148
00:15:53,324 --> 00:15:54,741
I got some water.

149
00:16:05,969 --> 00:16:07,137
This is good.

150
00:16:07,137 --> 00:16:08,804
This is really good.

151
00:16:12,662 --> 00:16:14,912
What else you got in there?

152
00:16:22,934 --> 00:16:23,767
Oh dear lord,

153
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:25,184
is that a pickle?

154
00:16:26,806 --> 00:16:28,537
I can't tell you the last time it's been

155
00:16:28,537 --> 00:16:30,287
since I had a pickle.

156
00:16:42,134 --> 00:16:42,967
This?

157
00:16:50,737 --> 00:16:51,904
This is great.

158
00:16:58,224 --> 00:17:01,141
(distressed music)

159
00:17:20,117 --> 00:17:22,117
Why don't you stay here?

160
00:17:23,899 --> 00:17:27,149
Please, I could use someone to talk to.

161
00:17:29,818 --> 00:17:31,818
Just someone to talk to.

162
00:17:34,504 --> 00:17:35,997
Well, your loss.

163
00:17:35,997 --> 00:17:38,580
(spooky music)

164
00:19:10,508 --> 00:19:11,919
(ladies laughing)

165
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:14,252
(sad music)

166
00:19:40,310 --> 00:19:43,770
(church bell tolls)

167
00:19:43,770 --> 00:19:46,341
(thunder rumbles)

168
00:19:46,341 --> 00:19:49,091
(dreadful music)

169
00:21:00,422 --> 00:21:03,005
(veiled music)

170
00:21:38,256 --> 00:21:39,762
- Do I know you from somewhere?

171
00:21:39,762 --> 00:21:41,773
- You may have seen me around.

172
00:21:41,773 --> 00:21:43,820
(Lazarus laughs)

173
00:21:43,820 --> 00:21:46,487
(Julian laughs)

174
00:21:47,904 --> 00:21:50,321
- Have you been following me?

175
00:21:51,916 --> 00:21:52,782
- For a while now.

176
00:21:52,782 --> 00:21:55,449
(furious music)

177
00:22:00,185 --> 00:22:01,390
(gunshots firing)

178
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:04,723
(punching and grunting)

179
00:22:38,637 --> 00:22:40,220
- Oh, I'm so sorry.

180
00:22:43,458 --> 00:22:46,041
I guess that blade was supposed

181
00:22:48,524 --> 00:22:51,441
to be sticking out of me right now,

182
00:22:56,514 --> 00:22:57,764
instead of you.

183
00:22:59,356 --> 00:23:00,606
- Yeah, it was.

184
00:23:02,081 --> 00:23:04,589
That's all right,
because now I got my gun.

185
00:23:04,589 --> 00:23:07,422
(gunshots firing)

186
00:23:19,954 --> 00:23:21,621
- Go ahead, kill me.

187
00:23:24,125 --> 00:23:26,958
(gunshots firing)

188
00:23:32,605 --> 00:23:33,438
- Ow!

189
00:23:33,438 --> 00:23:34,271
Ah!

190
00:23:37,287 --> 00:23:40,287
(metallic slashing)

191
00:23:41,563 --> 00:23:44,730
(teakettle whistling)

192
00:23:48,497 --> 00:23:49,330
- [Julian] Are you ever gonna tell me

193
00:23:49,330 --> 00:23:51,636
what you're marking on this map?

194
00:23:51,636 --> 00:23:53,500
Been hearing stories.

195
00:23:53,500 --> 00:23:54,900
With all due respect, sir,

196
00:23:54,900 --> 00:23:57,655
I've been hearing stories for years,

197
00:23:57,655 --> 00:23:59,297
incredible stories.

198
00:23:59,297 --> 00:24:00,671
Are they true?

199
00:24:00,671 --> 00:24:01,556
- Don't need to trouble yourself

200
00:24:01,556 --> 00:24:04,691
with rumors and urban legends.

201
00:24:04,691 --> 00:24:07,081
- [Julian] Watching people
count on their faith

202
00:24:07,081 --> 00:24:11,348
to save them as the world
around them crumbles,

203
00:24:11,348 --> 00:24:13,575
that's troubling.

204
00:24:13,575 --> 00:24:17,242
Rumors and urban legends,
that I understand.

205
00:24:18,681 --> 00:24:20,287
- Do you?

206
00:24:20,287 --> 00:24:23,956
Because once you're inside,
there's no turning back.

207
00:24:23,956 --> 00:24:26,495
You won't easily forget
what I will tell you.

208
00:24:26,495 --> 00:24:30,596
- [Julian] I have lived my
entire life as a soldier.

209
00:24:30,596 --> 00:24:32,270
I have never run from a fight.

210
00:24:32,270 --> 00:24:33,940
- Surely you aren't asking
me these questions now

211
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:35,359
after all this time

212
00:24:35,359 --> 00:24:37,442
because you heard things.

213
00:24:39,583 --> 00:24:41,394
Tell me why you ask now.

214
00:24:41,394 --> 00:24:43,487
- [Julian] You know I've had visions,

215
00:24:43,487 --> 00:24:44,921
as a child.

216
00:24:44,921 --> 00:24:46,919
- [Bishop] You've had visions?

217
00:24:46,919 --> 00:24:48,169
- [Julian] Yes.

218
00:24:49,183 --> 00:24:52,191
- [Bishop] Visions of things to come?

219
00:24:52,191 --> 00:24:53,441
- [Julian] Yes.

220
00:24:54,904 --> 00:24:58,143
- [Bishop] And you're having
them again now, aren't you?

221
00:24:58,143 --> 00:25:00,560
- [Julian] Yes, in my dreams.

222
00:25:03,382 --> 00:25:05,965
- Tell me exactly what you see.

223
00:25:07,724 --> 00:25:09,344
- [Julian] An orchid,

224
00:25:09,344 --> 00:25:12,920
one that's been blooming
for years and years.

225
00:25:12,920 --> 00:25:16,884
The blooms wither and
turn black overnight.

226
00:25:16,884 --> 00:25:19,548
Then I see a face rising up towards me

227
00:25:19,548 --> 00:25:21,215
out of the darkness.

228
00:25:24,681 --> 00:25:26,793
- [Bishop] We function in a world today

229
00:25:26,793 --> 00:25:30,197
where the very word of
God is being questioned.

230
00:25:30,197 --> 00:25:32,447
The church is either doubted or feared.

231
00:25:32,447 --> 00:25:36,724
Men of coffer are implicated
in scandal after scandal.

232
00:25:36,724 --> 00:25:39,760
One of the few things that
the world does not yet know

233
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:42,452
is that the church tends to those things

234
00:25:42,452 --> 00:25:44,180
that no one notices,

235
00:25:44,180 --> 00:25:48,170
things that make our lives so much easier,

236
00:25:48,170 --> 00:25:50,253
things taken for granted,

237
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:53,709
things that if not properly dealt with,

238
00:25:53,709 --> 00:25:56,714
could bring daily life to a halt,

239
00:25:56,714 --> 00:26:00,881
things that people don't want
to know about or deal with.

240
00:26:02,591 --> 00:26:03,870
They only want it taken care of.

241
00:26:03,870 --> 00:26:06,370
(eerie music)

242
00:26:45,137 --> 00:26:48,295
- [Julian] That's her,
the face in my dreams.

243
00:26:48,295 --> 00:26:49,570
- We knew it was just a matter of time

244
00:26:49,570 --> 00:26:51,244
before she came back.

245
00:26:51,244 --> 00:26:54,355
Men with your ability
have helped us before.

246
00:26:54,355 --> 00:26:55,987
You think it a coincidence
that you're here

247
00:26:55,987 --> 00:26:57,442
under my supervision?

248
00:26:57,442 --> 00:26:59,942
(phone rings)

249
00:27:06,993 --> 00:27:07,826
- Yes?

250
00:27:09,426 --> 00:27:10,593
I know, where?

251
00:27:12,761 --> 00:27:13,946
I know exactly where that is.

252
00:27:13,946 --> 00:27:17,210
I'll be there within the hour.

253
00:27:17,210 --> 00:27:18,043
Excuse me?

254
00:27:22,896 --> 00:27:24,896
The reading was neutral.

255
00:27:26,895 --> 00:27:28,266
I understand.

256
00:27:28,266 --> 00:27:30,766
(vexed music)

257
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:21,896
(airplane roars overhead)

258
00:28:33,099 --> 00:28:35,849
(yearning music)

259
00:29:04,701 --> 00:29:05,799
Excuse me.

260
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:06,866
- Yeah?

261
00:29:06,866 --> 00:29:08,743
- I understand you uncovered
some artifacts yesterday

262
00:29:08,743 --> 00:29:10,132
while you were digging.

263
00:29:10,132 --> 00:29:12,519
- You from the church?

264
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:14,119
- Yes, I am.

265
00:29:14,119 --> 00:29:18,876
I'm here to evaluate the
importance of the pieces.

266
00:29:18,876 --> 00:29:20,709
- It's right this way.

267
00:29:22,983 --> 00:29:24,233
Check this out.

268
00:29:28,002 --> 00:29:29,489
What do you think?

269
00:29:29,489 --> 00:29:31,656
- Was this here yesterday?

270
00:29:33,389 --> 00:29:34,712
- No, it wasn't.

271
00:29:34,712 --> 00:29:36,233
Listen, I want you to be careful,

272
00:29:36,233 --> 00:29:37,201
because I don't need you falling

273
00:29:37,201 --> 00:29:40,049
through any sinkhole
or anything, all right?

274
00:29:40,049 --> 00:29:41,966
- I'll be very careful.

275
00:29:43,025 --> 00:29:44,444
You found two artifacts, right?

276
00:29:44,444 --> 00:29:45,277
- Yeah.

277
00:29:46,620 --> 00:29:47,921
- May I see the other one?

278
00:29:47,921 --> 00:29:50,588
- Oh, yeah, I'm gonna go get it.

279
00:29:51,905 --> 00:29:54,822
(mysterious music)

280
00:30:23,509 --> 00:30:25,109
(digger laughs)

281
00:30:25,109 --> 00:30:26,776
Check this baby out.

282
00:30:29,997 --> 00:30:30,997
- Thank you.

283
00:30:33,616 --> 00:30:34,971
- What do you think?

284
00:30:34,971 --> 00:30:37,554
Do we have an artifact or what?

285
00:30:38,523 --> 00:30:39,910
- No.

286
00:30:39,910 --> 00:30:42,327
Not really, I'm sorry to say.

287
00:30:43,995 --> 00:30:46,846
The cross is old and might be a piece

288
00:30:46,846 --> 00:30:49,752
of one of the original
structures from the area,

289
00:30:49,752 --> 00:30:52,710
but I don't think it's a significant find.

290
00:30:52,710 --> 00:30:54,043
The wooden post,

291
00:30:55,451 --> 00:30:57,350
just a marker.

292
00:30:57,350 --> 00:30:59,376
Probably left over from
a crew at the time.

293
00:30:59,376 --> 00:31:00,582
Sorry to disappoint you.

294
00:31:00,582 --> 00:31:02,139
I can have a few people
out here this afternoon

295
00:31:02,139 --> 00:31:04,432
and we'll get this stuff out of your way.

296
00:31:04,432 --> 00:31:07,349
(foreboding music)

297
00:31:59,579 --> 00:32:02,412
(tires squealing)

298
00:32:04,496 --> 00:32:08,663
("UC Me" by Da Camp featuring Murphy Lee)

299
00:32:32,888 --> 00:32:33,721
Excuse me.

300
00:32:37,610 --> 00:32:39,562
Seen a woman around here?

301
00:32:39,562 --> 00:32:40,789
She would've looked like a homeless woman,

302
00:32:40,789 --> 00:32:42,344
probably covered in dirt,

303
00:32:42,344 --> 00:32:44,011
last 24 hours or so.

304
00:32:45,325 --> 00:32:46,575
- Why you care?

305
00:32:48,088 --> 00:32:49,755
- Have you seen her?

306
00:32:52,589 --> 00:32:53,764
- Yeah.

307
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:56,232
I seen a woman in pretty bad shape.

308
00:32:56,232 --> 00:32:58,140
Somebody messed her up.

309
00:32:58,140 --> 00:32:59,533
Know anything about that?

310
00:32:59,533 --> 00:33:00,952
- Yeah I do.

311
00:33:00,952 --> 00:33:01,785
If I could find her,

312
00:33:01,785 --> 00:33:03,411
I could help her get it straightened out.

313
00:33:03,411 --> 00:33:04,494
- You a cop.?

314
00:33:06,329 --> 00:33:07,992
- No.

315
00:33:07,992 --> 00:33:10,077
- Maybe you ought to get
the hell of my parking.

316
00:33:10,077 --> 00:33:11,427
♫ You see who they hating on

317
00:33:11,427 --> 00:33:12,941
♫ You see who we taking home

318
00:33:12,941 --> 00:33:14,692
♫ You see what we sitting on

319
00:33:14,692 --> 00:33:18,872
♫ I guess that's why you hating boy

320
00:33:18,872 --> 00:33:21,122
(smashing)

321
00:33:28,630 --> 00:33:31,565
- You don't like my
music, I can respect that,

322
00:33:31,565 --> 00:33:34,482
but you don't go breaking my stuff.

323
00:33:36,061 --> 00:33:37,805
Oh I done stared down the
barrel of a gun before,

324
00:33:37,805 --> 00:33:41,671
so you gonna have to do more
than that to impress me.

325
00:33:41,671 --> 00:33:43,127
Why don't you face me like a man?

326
00:33:43,127 --> 00:33:45,710
(veiled music)

327
00:33:54,894 --> 00:33:56,500
Yeah, I seen her.

328
00:33:56,500 --> 00:33:59,967
She was here last night, about 10:00.

329
00:33:59,967 --> 00:34:02,645
She don't look like that no more,

330
00:34:02,645 --> 00:34:04,062
but she was here.

331
00:34:04,948 --> 00:34:06,552
- She happen to say where she was going?

332
00:34:06,552 --> 00:34:08,784
- She couldn't talk.

333
00:34:08,784 --> 00:34:09,716
She wrote it down though.

334
00:34:09,716 --> 00:34:12,511
She was looking for Old Main
Street up by the riverfront,

335
00:34:12,511 --> 00:34:14,344
so I pointed her west.

336
00:34:16,031 --> 00:34:16,991
- That's it?

337
00:34:16,991 --> 00:34:21,158
- Gave her some food, a
coat, some old rubber boats.

338
00:34:22,068 --> 00:34:24,724
She went up that there road.

339
00:34:24,724 --> 00:34:27,307
- That's absolutely everything?

340
00:34:36,767 --> 00:34:38,600
- Hey what, that's it?

341
00:34:41,458 --> 00:34:43,199
Hey man, I don't know who
you are or where you live,

342
00:34:43,199 --> 00:34:46,548
but you better not be
the one that hurt her,

343
00:34:46,548 --> 00:34:49,521
and you owe me 50 bucks for the radio!

344
00:34:49,521 --> 00:34:52,188
(ominous music)

345
00:35:19,562 --> 00:35:20,395
- This is Julian.

346
00:35:20,395 --> 00:35:21,645
Put me through.

347
00:35:24,255 --> 00:35:26,666
Yes, sir, it's her.

348
00:35:26,666 --> 00:35:27,556
I'm positive.

349
00:35:27,556 --> 00:35:28,473
It's Laura.

350
00:35:39,450 --> 00:35:41,540
- Plain burger, would you
like anything else with that?

351
00:35:41,540 --> 00:35:43,094
- Is it too late to
add some cheese please?

352
00:35:43,094 --> 00:35:43,927
- No.

353
00:35:47,480 --> 00:35:50,897
(bells on door jingling)

354
00:36:20,530 --> 00:36:23,863
(sweet nostalgic music)

355
00:37:13,172 --> 00:37:16,589
- Primp, primp, all you ever do is primp.

356
00:37:17,470 --> 00:37:20,328
Enough primping. (laughs)

357
00:37:20,328 --> 00:37:24,446
- I want to look the
best I've ever looked.

358
00:37:24,446 --> 00:37:28,392
I do not want him to take his eyes off me.

359
00:37:28,392 --> 00:37:30,142
- You look beautiful.

360
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:33,834
- Beautiful is not enough.

361
00:37:35,929 --> 00:37:39,096
I want him to be powerless against me,

362
00:37:39,988 --> 00:37:41,694
to be caught up in my spell.

363
00:37:41,694 --> 00:37:44,444
(romantic music)

364
00:37:59,315 --> 00:38:03,464
- I think he's already
caught up in something.

365
00:38:03,464 --> 00:38:05,352
Are you really going to do this?

366
00:38:05,352 --> 00:38:08,185
(twinkling music)

367
00:38:31,081 --> 00:38:33,748
(kids laughing)

368
00:38:36,809 --> 00:38:39,559
(Lazarus laughs)

369
00:39:42,786 --> 00:39:45,703
(car horn honking)

373
00:40:30,717 --> 00:40:31,634
- 90 bucks.

374
00:40:36,151 --> 00:40:37,568
- Do you see her?

375
00:40:41,192 --> 00:40:43,525
- Hey, you can't be in here.

376
00:40:46,299 --> 00:40:48,509
Seriously, if you're
not gonna buy something,

377

you can't be in here.

00:41:12,365 --> 00:41:14,115

Anybody in there?

396
00:43:14,007 --> 00:43:16,450
- This comes from your vines?

397
00:43:16,450 --> 00:43:18,381
- [Man] Well yes, but originally

398
00:43:18,381 --> 00:43:20,881
I brought them in from France.

I'm so glad you came.

Bless you for having me.

- [Laura's Mother] Please
make yourself at home.

00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:37,113
The entire family is here tonight.

406
00:43:37,113 --> 00:43:38,474
- Does that mean I'll have an opportunity

407
00:43:38,474 --> 00:43:40,090
to speak with your charming daughter?

408
00:43:40,090 --> 00:43:41,988
- Oh Pastor, I wish you would.

409
00:43:41,988 --> 00:43:45,051
I do not like the type she
has been seen with lately.

410
00:43:45,051 --> 00:43:46,612
- [Laura's Mother] Our friends
say they've caught glimpses

411
00:43:46,612 --> 00:43:50,466
of our girl talking to
some tall, dark stranger

00:43:50,466 --> 00:43:51,791
who's new in town.

- Have you asked her about him?

414
00:43:52,698 --> 00:43:53,558
- Yes.

415
00:43:53,558 --> 00:43:55,796
She denies knowing anything about it.

416
00:43:55,796 --> 00:43:57,208
- I'm about to take a hand to her.

417
00:43:57,208 --> 00:44:00,606
- Please, Mr. Wolff, I hope
that won't be necessary.

418
00:44:00,606 --> 00:44:02,153
Would you mind if I speak with her?

419
00:44:02,153 --> 00:44:03,662
You know how fond I am of your daughter.

420
00:44:03,662 --> 00:44:05,150
Maybe she'll confide in me.

421
00:44:05,150 --> 00:44:06,825
- Oh Pastor, as far as we're concerned,

422
00:44:06,825 --> 00:44:09,504
you have our permission to
take her under your wing.

423
00:44:09,504 --> 00:44:12,627
- We have the utmost
respect for you, Pastor.

424
00:44:12,627 --> 00:44:14,441
I think she would do well too,

425
00:44:14,441 --> 00:44:17,438
allowing herself with
a man of your caliber.

426
00:44:17,438 --> 00:44:18,872
May I pour you a glass of wine?

- That would be wonderful.

428
00:44:25,236 --> 00:44:28,653
Consider her under my counsel, Mr. Wolff.

Whoa!

(ominous music)

455
00:48:56,558 --> 00:48:57,475
- I've been

00:48:58,488 --> 00:48:59,321
so cold,

457
00:49:01,434 --> 00:49:02,267
so lonely

458
00:49:07,725 --> 00:49:08,558

464
00:50:08,805 --> 00:50:11,069
Did you shove him?

465
00:50:11,069 --> 00:50:12,057
Hey!

00:50:28,996 --> 00:50:31,193
They took a lot of stuff.

469
00:50:31,193 --> 00:50:33,700
- Ma'am, you don't have an inventory list,

470
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:35,648
you don't know the value of the items.

471
00:50:35,648 --> 00:50:36,620
- The boots.

472
00:50:36,620 --> 00:50:39,343
- Right, you know the value of the boots,

473
00:50:39,343 --> 00:50:40,920
but none of the other items.

474
00:50:40,920 --> 00:50:44,452
Plus, you told us you
didn't actually see anyone.

- Put your hands on your head for me.

505

Take it easy, ma'am.

506
00:52:18,410 --> 00:52:22,577
We're just looking for
weapons right now, that's all.

507
00:52:26,207 --> 00:52:28,040
Where you coming from?

508
00:52:31,460 --> 00:52:33,877
And where are you headed now?

509
00:52:35,867 --> 00:52:38,784
I think we've got ourselves a mute.

510
00:52:47,022 --> 00:52:47,855
There you go.

What, you got family there?

- Hey, hey, can you write down on there

515
00:53:07,535 --> 00:53:11,852
and tell us where you
were about 20 minutes ago.

516
00:53:11,852 --> 00:53:13,178
We got a homeless guy.

517
00:53:13,178 --> 00:53:15,730
Sounds like he got the crap
kicked out of him pretty good.

518
00:53:15,730 --> 00:53:18,682
You wouldn't be an amateur
martial artist, would you?

519
00:53:18,682 --> 00:53:21,392
A little enthusiastic about self-defense?

520
00:53:21,392 --> 00:53:22,351
- [Cop On Radio] David 2 to David 3.

521

to her neck,

523
00:53:25,306 --> 00:53:26,572
possibly a big cut.

524
00:53:26,572 --> 00:53:28,523
Says she covered it up with a scarf.

525
00:53:28,523 --> 00:53:31,029
- David 3 clear, checking now.

526
00:53:31,029 --> 00:53:34,612
- Ma'am, can you take
off the scarf for me?

527
00:53:35,925 --> 00:53:38,404
All right, just put your
hands behind your back.

528
00:53:38,404 --> 00:53:39,237
- She's gonna bolt.

529
00:53:39,237 --> 00:53:40,651
- Hey, don't make this
any harder on yourself

530
00:53:40,651 --> 00:53:42,151
than it has to be!

531
00:53:45,589 --> 00:53:46,422
Damn, that was fast.

532
00:53:46,422 --> 00:53:47,839
Did you see that?

533
00:53:49,376 --> 00:53:51,723
- Don't ever let them see you
coming with your cuffs out.

534
00:53:51,723 --> 00:53:54,155
David 3 to David 2, suspect has fled.

535
00:53:54,155 --> 00:53:55,968
Moving north through Grant Park.

536
00:53:55,968 --> 00:53:58,419
Establish a perimeter
from Grant to Market.

537
00:53:58,419 --> 00:53:59,427
(sirens whirring)

538
00:53:59,427 --> 00:54:02,177
(dramatic music)

539
00:54:43,402 --> 00:54:44,235
- Stop!

540
00:54:46,086 --> 00:54:47,743
Ah!

541
00:54:47,743 --> 00:54:48,743
I said stop!

542
00:54:49,730 --> 00:54:50,619
Stay where you are!

543
00:54:50,619 --> 00:54:53,202
(urgent music)

544
00:54:56,992 --> 00:55:00,492
Okay, if that's the way you wanna play it.

545
00:55:04,603 --> 00:55:05,928
I got her!

546
00:55:05,928 --> 00:55:06,761
Over here.

547
00:55:08,928 --> 00:55:10,293
Watch out for the wires!

548
00:55:10,293 --> 00:55:12,793
(tense music)

549
00:55:25,103 --> 00:55:27,047
1030, 1030, officer down!

550
00:55:27,047 --> 00:55:27,880

552
00:55:33,581 --> 00:55:36,475
- She's gotta come through here.

553
00:55:36,475 --> 00:55:38,080
- David 3 and David 2 in position

554
00:55:38,080 --> 00:55:40,037
at the West Gate of Grant Park.

555
00:55:40,037 --> 00:55:42,870
Will intercept suspect and detain.

556
00:55:44,356 --> 00:55:45,189
Damn!

557
00:55:46,279 --> 00:55:47,823
David 3, suspect has left Grant Park

558
00:55:47,823 --> 00:55:50,757
and is now moving through
the Westwood area.

559
00:55:50,757 --> 00:55:52,047
Hey, are we going after her?

560
00:55:52,047 --> 00:55:54,202
- She just knocked out
two police officers!

561
00:55:54,202 --> 00:55:56,591
You're damn right we're going after her!

562
00:55:56,591 --> 00:55:59,424
(tires squealing)

563
00:56:00,293 --> 00:56:03,126
(sirens whirring)

564
00:56:05,626 --> 00:56:08,376
(troubled music)

565
00:58:20,003 --> 00:58:21,170
- Laura, stop!

566
00:58:24,558 --> 00:58:26,891
- [Lazarus Voiceover] Laura.

567
00:58:27,945 --> 00:58:28,778
Laura.

568
00:58:28,778 --> 00:58:31,111
(sad music)

569
00:58:42,140 --> 00:58:43,203
(gunshots firing)

570
00:58:43,203 --> 00:58:45,953
(frenzied music)

571
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:53,523
Laura, stop!

572
00:58:53,523 --> 00:58:56,273
(dramatic music)

573
00:59:11,037 --> 00:59:13,870
(sirens whirring)

574
00:59:20,978 --> 00:59:23,645
(ominous music)

575
00:59:31,087 --> 00:59:33,124
- I do not want to hear an explanation.

576
00:59:33,124 --> 00:59:35,272
I do not want to hear an excuse.

577
00:59:35,272 --> 00:59:37,091
You will apologize to the Pastor.

578
00:59:37,091 --> 00:59:38,508
- I will not!

579
00:59:38,508 --> 00:59:39,780
- You will.

580
00:59:39,780 --> 00:59:42,276
You will because I say you will.

581
00:59:42,276 --> 00:59:43,897
Who do you think you are?

582
00:59:43,897 --> 00:59:45,519
Your mother and I approve of this man.

583
00:59:45,519 --> 00:59:47,532
- Do you approve of him
touching me like that?

584
00:59:47,532 --> 00:59:49,145
- Shut your mouth!

585
00:59:49,145 --> 00:59:51,848
Why do you speak about him that way?

586
00:59:51,848 --> 00:59:54,985
Are you trying to turn us against him?

587
00:59:54,985 --> 00:59:56,868
You can do no better in this town.

588
00:59:56,868 --> 00:59:59,471
- I've already done better.

589
00:59:59,471 --> 01:00:00,304
- Ah,

590
01:00:01,935 --> 01:00:04,185
your special little friend.

591
01:00:06,649 --> 01:00:10,232
You will not be seeing
that intruder again.

592
01:00:11,108 --> 01:00:12,191
- Yes I will.

593
01:00:15,606 --> 01:00:17,523
And you cannot stop me.

594
01:00:22,457 --> 01:00:23,993
(slaps)

595
01:00:23,993 --> 01:00:26,660
(weighty music)

596
01:03:02,822 --> 01:03:05,739
- Then I will pray for you, Julian.

597
01:03:08,142 --> 01:03:10,769
And I will pray for Laura.

598
01:03:10,769 --> 01:03:13,062
If there's hope for any of them,

599
01:03:13,062 --> 01:03:15,008
there's hope for her.

600
01:03:15,008 --> 01:03:18,258
(knocking on the door)

601
01:03:20,636 --> 01:03:22,719
(laughs)

602
01:03:26,182 --> 01:03:28,084
So good to see you, Julian.

603
01:03:28,084 --> 01:03:30,225
I hope the shoulder is feeling better.

604
01:03:30,225 --> 01:03:31,313
- Feeling much better.

605
01:03:31,313 --> 01:03:32,774
Healing up very well.

606
01:03:32,774 --> 01:03:34,696
- Glad to hear it.

607
01:03:34,696 --> 01:03:37,999
I don't think you know how
important you are to us.

608
01:03:37,999 --> 01:03:40,082
- Actually, I think I do.

609
01:04:05,308 --> 01:04:07,164
- Who did this belong to?

610
01:04:07,164 --> 01:04:08,247
- Originally?

611
01:04:09,138 --> 01:04:10,527
Laura.

612
01:04:10,527 --> 01:04:11,549
- Are you sure?

613
01:04:11,549 --> 01:04:14,226
- I took it off the man in the alley.

614
01:04:14,226 --> 01:04:16,668
He called himself Lazarus.

615
01:04:16,668 --> 01:04:20,263
You can appreciate the irony in that.

616
01:04:20,263 --> 01:04:23,346
I believe he was using it to track Laura.

617
01:04:23,346 --> 01:04:27,346
Luckily I got to him
before he could get to her.

618
01:04:32,967 --> 01:04:36,467
- I trust you will treat that and seal it.

619
01:04:37,490 --> 01:04:38,905
- When the time is right, I'll
use it to track her myself.

620
01:04:38,905 --> 01:04:41,905
- I see that you got my little gift.

621
01:04:45,658 --> 01:04:46,491
- Yes.

622
01:04:58,541 --> 01:05:01,122
You want me to start catching
stray dogs and cats now?

623
01:05:01,122 --> 01:05:03,138
- It's something to consider, Julian.

624
01:05:03,138 --> 01:05:05,858
We must make a better
attempt to save them.

625
01:05:05,858 --> 01:05:09,357
Your treatment of Lazarus was shameful.

626
01:05:09,357 --> 01:05:10,357
- Oh please.

627
01:05:12,290 --> 01:05:14,277
- They're people, Julian.

628
01:05:14,277 --> 01:05:16,333
They have souls.

629
01:05:16,333 --> 01:05:18,839
We must make an attempt to save them.

630
01:05:18,839 --> 01:05:21,153
The church is demanding that we try.

631
01:05:21,153 --> 01:05:23,633
- The church has no
idea what they're like.

632
01:05:23,633 --> 01:05:27,327
- But Julian, what has happened to you?

633
01:05:27,327 --> 01:05:29,350
What has happened to your faith?

634
01:05:29,350 --> 01:05:33,459
- If you were in that
alley with me, you'd know.

635
01:05:33,459 --> 01:05:37,626
I wish I could see the
humanity in them, I really do.

636
01:05:40,069 --> 01:05:41,880
Every time I go out there,

637
01:05:41,880 --> 01:05:46,047
I hope I will see something
that will change my mind,

638
01:05:47,463 --> 01:05:49,713
give me some reason to have

639
01:05:51,927 --> 01:05:53,094
faith in them.

640
01:05:56,781 --> 01:05:59,031
Then I'm forced to kill another one.

641
01:05:59,031 --> 01:06:01,178
- You're forced?

642
01:06:01,178 --> 01:06:02,345
- Yes, forced.

643
01:06:03,634 --> 01:06:05,783
Do you think I actually enjoy this?

644
01:06:05,783 --> 01:06:08,533
(troubled music)

645
01:06:12,903 --> 01:06:15,851
Why all the sudden concern?

646
01:06:15,851 --> 01:06:17,549
- I've been studying the Wolff file,

647
01:06:17,549 --> 01:06:19,778
reading over the accounts
of what happened,

648
01:06:19,778 --> 01:06:22,605
Laura's part in all of it.

649
01:06:22,605 --> 01:06:25,165
Julian, I believe Laura
to be completely innocent

650
01:06:25,165 --> 01:06:27,714
in this entire affair.

651
01:06:27,714 --> 01:06:29,804
This woman has been betrayed by everyone

652
01:06:29,804 --> 01:06:32,424
and everything around her.

653
01:06:32,424 --> 01:06:35,725
She had no way out, no chance.

654
01:06:35,725 --> 01:06:39,053
What will you do if you
find her reading good

655
01:06:39,053 --> 01:06:40,489
or even neutral?

656
01:06:40,489 --> 01:06:42,663
- I'll do my job like I always do.

657
01:06:42,663 --> 01:06:44,642
- Even if her reading is good?

658
01:06:44,642 --> 01:06:46,572
- She won't stay good for long.

659
01:06:46,572 --> 01:06:49,308
- Look, Julian, the normal,
average person would--

660
01:06:49,308 --> 01:06:51,938
- Placed under those circumstances,

661
01:06:51,938 --> 01:06:53,906
too much temptation.

662
01:06:53,906 --> 01:06:55,379
You have to trust me on this.

663
01:06:55,379 --> 01:06:56,754
- How can you be sure?

664
01:06:56,754 --> 01:06:58,386
- Because I know what I've seen.

665
01:06:58,386 --> 01:07:00,699
- But is this the right thing?

666
01:07:00,699 --> 01:07:02,118
- It's the necessary thing.

667
01:07:02,118 --> 01:07:03,077
- And what if you're wrong?

668
01:07:03,077 --> 01:07:04,654
- Then I'll pay the price for it!

669
01:07:04,654 --> 01:07:07,237
(somber music)

670
01:07:32,700 --> 01:07:35,617
- Then I will pray for you, Julian.

671
01:07:39,645 --> 01:07:42,386
And I will pray for Laura.

672
01:07:42,386 --> 01:07:46,553
If there's hope for any of
them, there's hope for her.

673
01:07:49,650 --> 01:07:51,975
Will you at least try to save her?

674
01:07:51,975 --> 01:07:54,808
(perplexed music)

675
01:08:38,655 --> 01:08:41,488
(emotional music)

676
01:11:36,576 --> 01:11:41,047
(chattering on police radio)

677
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:43,797
(peaceful music)

678
01:12:26,091 --> 01:12:27,174
- Don't move!

679
01:12:29,856 --> 01:12:31,689
Let me see your hands.

680
01:12:42,872 --> 01:12:43,705
Holy...

681
01:12:44,606 --> 01:12:46,023
Did you see that?

682
01:12:47,495 --> 01:12:48,328
Where'd she go?

683
01:12:48,328 --> 01:12:49,161
- I don't know.

684
01:12:49,161 --> 01:12:50,802
- Is she still even in the yard?

685
01:12:50,802 --> 01:12:53,302
(eerie music)

686
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:03,107
(gunshot fires)

687
01:13:20,866 --> 01:13:23,097
- Frank 1, 1030, 1030, officer is down.

688
01:13:23,097 --> 01:13:25,764
(fretful music)

689
01:14:18,212 --> 01:14:20,897
- Frank 4, suspect sighted
at the 1100 block of Main.

690
01:14:20,897 --> 01:14:22,713
She just cut between the
bar and the restaurant,

691
01:14:22,713 --> 01:14:25,038
heading west into the alley.

692
01:14:25,038 --> 01:14:28,038
(suspenseful music)

693
01:14:42,849 --> 01:14:46,900
(grunting and thudding)

694
01:14:46,900 --> 01:14:49,986
Ma'am, come out from under
there now, right now!

695
01:14:49,986 --> 01:14:52,986
(suspenseful music)

696
01:15:04,962 --> 01:15:07,795
(gunshots firing)

697
01:15:10,124 --> 01:15:12,685
Frank 4, shots fired,
shots fired, officers down!

698
01:15:12,685 --> 01:15:15,518
(thrilling music)

699
01:16:02,490 --> 01:16:05,323
(nostalgic music)

700
01:16:19,855 --> 01:16:22,605
(dart gun fires)

701
01:16:34,950 --> 01:16:35,950
- Stay down!

702
01:16:38,566 --> 01:16:39,399
Stay down!

703
01:16:43,142 --> 01:16:45,094
Listen to me very carefully.

704
01:16:45,094 --> 01:16:47,855
The peace officers will be
catching up with us any second.

705
01:16:47,855 --> 01:16:49,589
You do not want that.

706
01:16:49,589 --> 01:16:52,764
They do not understand who you
are or where you came from,

707
01:16:52,764 --> 01:16:54,150
but I do.

708
01:16:54,150 --> 01:16:56,534
I'm going to give you one
chance to come with me.

709
01:16:56,534 --> 01:16:59,398
It's going to be my way and
it's going to be peaceful,

710
01:16:59,398 --> 01:17:00,668
or I will kill you.

711
01:17:00,668 --> 01:17:02,781
Do you understand?

712
01:17:02,781 --> 01:17:04,281
Do you understand?

713
01:17:14,460 --> 01:17:15,543
- Don't move!

714
01:17:16,758 --> 01:17:17,830
Drop your weapons!

715
01:17:17,830 --> 01:17:19,601
Let me see your hands!

716
01:17:19,601 --> 01:17:20,966
- This is a DOD matter.

717
01:17:20,966 --> 01:17:22,854
- I said drop your weapons
and let me see your hands!

718
01:17:22,854 --> 01:17:25,604
(troubled music)

719
01:17:29,046 --> 01:17:31,146
- Oh, this is gonna be fun.

720
01:17:31,146 --> 01:17:34,146
(suspenseful music)

721
01:18:10,267 --> 01:18:12,517
- Dear God, please help me.

722
01:18:13,429 --> 01:18:16,262
(sirens whirring)

723
01:18:19,519 --> 01:18:21,141
- Finally.

724
01:18:21,141 --> 01:18:22,837
- What the hell is going on here?

725
01:18:22,837 --> 01:18:24,533
- This man claims to be DOD.

726
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:25,778
He has this.

727
01:18:25,778 --> 01:18:29,195
That crazy woman is hiding in the church.

728
01:18:32,806 --> 01:18:35,183
- I'm sorry for the
misunderstanding, Mr. Hess.

729
01:18:35,183 --> 01:18:36,527
- What?!

730
01:18:36,527 --> 01:18:40,194
- You have my department's
full cooperation.

731
01:18:41,648 --> 01:18:43,215
- I'm going in alone.

732
01:18:43,215 --> 01:18:44,537
Deploy your men around the church.

733
01:18:44,537 --> 01:18:46,906
Set up a perimeter.

734
01:18:46,906 --> 01:18:48,858
If the woman inside gets past me,

735
01:18:48,858 --> 01:18:52,338
you'll have to act very quickly,

736
01:18:52,338 --> 01:18:53,741
and call for backup.

737
01:18:53,741 --> 01:18:56,241
(scary music)

738
01:19:21,673 --> 01:19:24,590
(glass shattering)

739
01:20:30,337 --> 01:20:32,920
(Laura coughs)

740
01:20:36,848 --> 01:20:39,598
(dart gun fires)

741
01:21:34,167 --> 01:21:36,750
- Why are you doing this to me?

742
01:21:38,125 --> 01:21:39,664
- I'm trying to save you.

743
01:21:39,664 --> 01:21:41,877
I've been trying to save you all along,

744
01:21:41,877 --> 01:21:43,554
from the first time I saw you.

745
01:21:43,554 --> 01:21:45,033
- Save me?

746
01:21:45,033 --> 01:21:48,514
- Laura, do you remember the Pastor?

747
01:21:48,514 --> 01:21:50,205
He was trying to save you too.

748
01:21:50,205 --> 01:21:51,038
- Save me?

749
01:21:52,973 --> 01:21:55,341
The Pastor wanted to possess me

750
01:21:55,341 --> 01:21:57,821
and show me off like a trophy.

751
01:21:57,821 --> 01:21:59,771
He did not love me.

752
01:21:59,771 --> 01:22:01,604
- No, that's not true.

753
01:22:03,416 --> 01:22:05,395
Laura, he was trying to free your soul.

754
01:22:05,395 --> 01:22:07,927
You don't know what's been done to you.

755
01:22:07,927 --> 01:22:09,901
- I don't know?

756
01:22:09,901 --> 01:22:12,539
You have no idea what I've been through.

757
01:22:12,539 --> 01:22:14,242
- Stay where you are.

758
01:22:14,242 --> 01:22:15,778
I mean it.

759
01:22:15,778 --> 01:22:19,278
I'll put a stake right through your heart.

760
01:22:20,471 --> 01:22:22,344
- What has become of me?

761
01:22:22,344 --> 01:22:25,271
Where is my life, my memories?

762
01:22:25,271 --> 01:22:28,104
- You fell in love with the Devil.

763
01:22:29,527 --> 01:22:30,551
Let me hear your confession.

764
01:22:30,551 --> 01:22:32,354
Let me draw the evil out of you.

765
01:22:32,354 --> 01:22:34,537
- What did you do to me?

766
01:22:34,537 --> 01:22:36,528
- You did this to yourself.

767
01:22:36,528 --> 01:22:39,348
(gun fires)

768
01:22:39,348 --> 01:22:41,848
(tense music)

769
01:23:30,855 --> 01:23:31,688
- Enough!

770
01:23:32,924 --> 01:23:33,757
Who are you?

771
01:23:33,757 --> 01:23:34,721
Turn and face me.

772
01:23:34,721 --> 01:23:37,304
(spooky music)

773
01:23:40,016 --> 01:23:42,766
(Lazarus laughs)

774
01:23:50,685 --> 01:23:53,852
(Laura gasps for air)

775
01:23:57,578 --> 01:23:59,911
(gun fires)

776
01:24:41,541 --> 01:24:44,374
(Lazarus screams)

777
01:24:49,752 --> 01:24:52,919
(Laura gasps for air)

778
01:24:54,905 --> 01:24:57,488
(Laura growls)

779
01:25:06,473 --> 01:25:07,306
- Come on!

780
01:25:07,306 --> 01:25:10,056
(dramatic music)

781
01:25:16,761 --> 01:25:17,844
There she is!

782
01:25:20,270 --> 01:25:22,603
Come on, she's getting away!

783
01:25:23,717 --> 01:25:25,967
(thudding)

784
01:25:34,455 --> 01:25:36,187
- I'm sorry.

785
01:25:36,187 --> 01:25:37,807
Tie her up.

786
01:25:37,807 --> 01:25:40,224
(dark music)

787
01:25:58,737 --> 01:26:02,904
(thunder rumbles)
(church bells tolling)

788
01:26:12,455 --> 01:26:15,122
(thunder booms)

789
01:26:18,461 --> 01:26:19,459
- Go up to the new church site

790
01:26:19,459 --> 01:26:21,270
and look for a crate marked All Saints.

791
01:26:21,270 --> 01:26:22,269
Bring it here.

792
01:26:22,269 --> 01:26:24,852
(wicked music)

793
01:26:28,477 --> 01:26:30,216
Dear Heavenly Father,

794
01:26:30,216 --> 01:26:31,903
I pray in the power of the Holy Spirit

795
01:26:31,903 --> 01:26:33,512
in the name of Jesus Christ.

796
01:26:33,512 --> 01:26:35,083
(Laura growls)

797
01:26:35,083 --> 01:26:37,245
No weapon formed against me shall prosper,

798
01:26:37,245 --> 01:26:40,083
for I wear the full armor of God.

799
01:26:40,083 --> 01:26:43,677
I declare that Satan is
beneath me and shall remain so.

800
01:26:43,677 --> 01:26:47,560
I ask that his angels protect
this town and these brave men

801
01:26:47,560 --> 01:26:49,949
in the name of Jesus Christ.

802
01:26:49,949 --> 01:26:50,782
Amen.

803
01:26:50,782 --> 01:26:53,199
(evil music)

804
01:26:55,637 --> 01:26:58,220
(Laura coughs)

805
01:27:20,324 --> 01:27:22,991
(flesh slicing)

806
01:27:26,841 --> 01:27:31,008
(thunder rumbling)
(church bells tolling)

807
01:27:58,262 --> 01:28:01,095
(heavy breathing)

808
01:28:03,489 --> 01:28:06,239
(Laura groaning)

809
01:28:17,909 --> 01:28:20,326
Get thee down, untamed beast!

810
01:28:24,457 --> 01:28:27,290
(gunshots firing)

811
01:28:29,291 --> 01:28:30,958
- Go ahead, kill me.

812
01:28:34,091 --> 01:28:36,573
If I can't see my Laura again,

813
01:28:36,573 --> 01:28:39,656
I don't wanna live like this anymore.

814
01:28:40,954 --> 01:28:43,697
(gunshots firing)

815
01:28:43,697 --> 01:28:44,886
- [Julian] I took it off
the man in the alley.

816
01:28:44,886 --> 01:28:48,412
- [Bishop] I trust you will
treat that and seal it.

817
01:28:48,412 --> 01:28:51,162
(dramatic music)

818
01:29:00,545 --> 01:29:03,378
(thunder booming)

819
01:29:44,730 --> 01:29:46,789
(Laura screams)

820
01:29:46,789 --> 01:29:49,706
(glass shattering)

821
01:29:55,558 --> 01:29:57,975
(Laura sobs)

822
01:30:07,356 --> 01:30:09,689
(sad music)

823
01:30:33,604 --> 01:30:36,521
(glass shattering)

824
01:30:53,159 --> 01:30:55,826
(warlike music)

825
01:31:20,563 --> 01:31:21,480
- Go go go!

826
01:31:23,999 --> 01:31:24,832
Move it!

827
01:31:26,805 --> 01:31:28,904
All right, guys, stay close, come on.

828
01:31:28,904 --> 01:31:31,571
(warlike music)

829
01:32:02,844 --> 01:32:05,177
(exploding)

830
01:32:13,648 --> 01:32:15,856
Hands, let me see your hands!

831
01:32:15,856 --> 01:32:17,706
Get down on the ground, now!

832
01:32:17,706 --> 01:32:18,811
Or else we will deploy.

833
01:32:18,811 --> 01:32:21,536
(gun fires)

834
01:32:21,536 --> 01:32:22,369
- Move!

835
01:32:26,314 --> 01:32:28,897
(Laura growls)

836
01:32:32,010 --> 01:32:34,760
(dramatic music)

837
01:32:37,452 --> 01:32:39,906
- Williams, Williams, you all right?

838
01:32:39,906 --> 01:32:43,167
Clark, you all right back there?

839
01:32:43,167 --> 01:32:44,000
Clark!

840
01:32:45,355 --> 01:32:46,422
Williams!

841
01:32:46,422 --> 01:32:47,255
Down!

842
01:32:50,178 --> 01:32:53,011
(gunshots firing)

843
01:32:57,270 --> 01:33:00,103
(officer screams)

844
01:33:03,166 --> 01:33:05,416
(smashing)

845
01:33:08,071 --> 01:33:09,918
- [Cop] Go go go go go!

846
01:33:09,918 --> 01:33:12,918
(suspenseful music)

847
01:33:28,451 --> 01:33:29,284
- Shh.

848
01:33:30,945 --> 01:33:33,862
(expressive music)

849
01:34:42,445 --> 01:34:47,140
- [Bishop Voiceover] Then I
will pray for you, Julian,

850
01:34:47,140 --> 01:34:49,896
and I will pray for Laura.

851
01:34:49,896 --> 01:34:54,063
If there's hope for any of
them, there's hope for her.

852
01:35:19,156 --> 01:35:23,323
♫ How in an instance can
my heart turn to pain

853
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:29,286
♫ Where does the heartache come from

854
01:35:31,207 --> 01:35:35,374
♫ How can my mind be clear and so free

855
01:35:37,170 --> 01:35:40,837
♫ And a moment so uncertain

856
01:35:43,164 --> 01:35:47,331
♫ Life through your eyes is not easy alone

857
01:35:48,647 --> 01:35:52,397
♫ In fact the exact opposite

858
01:35:54,699 --> 01:35:57,255
♫ So why am I shy

859
01:35:57,255 --> 01:35:59,975
♫ When I'm faced with fear

860
01:35:59,975 --> 01:36:04,142
♫ And when I have too
little time to face it

861
01:36:08,519 --> 01:36:11,686
♫ When will I be okay

862
01:36:13,859 --> 01:36:17,942
♫ With a story that's not my own

863
01:36:20,242 --> 01:36:24,409
♫ How can I live every moment with truth

864
01:36:25,511 --> 01:36:29,678
♫ When you're there
through all I've been given

865
01:36:32,953 --> 01:36:34,854
♫ I think of my fate

866
01:36:34,854 --> 01:36:38,084
♫ From the past of my life

867
01:36:38,084 --> 01:36:42,251
♫ And suddenly it's burning my soul

868
01:36:45,738 --> 01:36:50,131
♫ The question of why or how could this be

869
01:36:50,131 --> 01:36:54,131
♫ Begins to creep up in my mind

870
01:36:56,873 --> 01:36:58,793
♫ I stare through the floor

871
01:36:58,793 --> 01:37:02,082
♫ With no far as I can see

872
01:37:02,082 --> 01:37:06,249
♫ At this moment there is nothing at all

873
01:37:09,699 --> 01:37:12,866
♫ When will I be okay

874
01:37:15,327 --> 01:37:18,879
♫ With a story that's not my own

875
01:37:18,879 --> 01:37:21,751
♫ A story that's not my own

876
01:37:21,751 --> 01:37:25,918
♫ How can I live every moment in truth

877
01:37:27,020 --> 01:37:31,187
♫ When you've been through
all I've been given

878
01:37:37,697 --> 01:37:40,614
♫ I want an answer

879
01:37:42,720 --> 01:37:47,009
♫ I want a hand to hold me

880
01:37:47,009 --> 01:37:49,576
♫ Steady

881
01:37:49,576 --> 01:37:53,409
♫ I need to let go and I will

882
01:37:56,052 --> 01:37:58,885
♫ I just need you

883
01:38:05,364 --> 01:38:08,531
♫ When will I be okay

884
01:38:10,882 --> 01:38:14,281
♫ With a story that's not my own

885
01:38:14,281 --> 01:38:17,235
♫ Story that's not my own

886
01:38:17,235 --> 01:38:21,402
♫ How can I live every moment with truth

887
01:38:22,564 --> 01:38:26,731
