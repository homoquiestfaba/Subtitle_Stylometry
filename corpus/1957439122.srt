Mrs. Claus is going
to get Santa a little drink,

603
01:01:12,940 --> 01:01:14,942
[Frank] What do you mean, "Take it easy"?
Am I not taking it easy?

604

I'm fine. God, what are you...
what are you doing?

605

- Please don't be like this. Really? Come... do you...
- [inaudible]

606
01:01:20,948 --> 01:01:23,417
By the way, do you think she
can't hear you? She's right there.

607
01:01:23,450 --> 01:01:25,352
Do you think she can't hear
you just because you whisper?

Hi, by the way.
It's me, I'm your dad.

This is how we want to
spend the holidays, is it?
