Yeah, of course.
I'll see you later.

543
00:40:36,434 --> 00:40:39,267
Okay. Bye.

544
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:42,000
Hey, if you gotta be at home
with your kid,

545
00:40:42,033 --> 00:40:44,000

then you should go.

546
00:40:44,033 --> 00:40:45,033
We can handle it.

547
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:49,567
What I need is real-time info

<i>Kim, today's a day

571

Tornado warnings are
just outside our viewing area,

572
00:41:52,701 --> 00:41:54,300
but we're under a PDS

<i>over at Emergency Management?</i>

576
00:42:01,067 --> 00:42:05,134
Well, for us it means people
need to be aware and prepared.

577
00:42:05,167 --> 00:42:07,000
But shouldn't people
be worried?

578
00:42:07,033 --> 00:42:09,401
No. Prepared is what
people need to be.

579

580

on hand

you will not have time
to go searching.

583
00:42:16,567 --> 00:42:19,000
Now, severe weather
is pretty common,

584
00:42:19,033 --> 00:42:21,000
but what about school closures?

585
00:42:21,033 --> 00:42:23,401
Well, the potential today
is heightened.

but the ingredients
are coming together.

588
00:42:27,601 --> 00:42:29,134
A PDS watch means

589
00:42:29,167 --> 00:42:32,000
a potential for numerous
destructive tornadoes.

01:23:58,726 --> 01:24:00,425
Hey, can you help us?

1083
01:24:00,459 --> 01:24:01,692
My daughter's under here.
Please.

1084
01:24:08,559 --> 01:24:10,058
Careful.

1085
01:24:11,559 --> 01:24:13,025
Maddy!

1086
01:24:17,158 --> 01:24:18,559
Okay, watch it.

1087
01:24:22,325 --> 01:24:23,292
Oh, my God.

1088
01:24:24,425 --> 01:24:27,292
Honey, honey.

1089
01:24:27,325 --> 01:24:29,259
Maddy, babe.

1090
01:24:29,292 --> 01:24:30,292
Well, what, is she...

1091
01:24:31,459 --> 01:24:33,792
Vicky, please!

1092
01:24:33,826 --> 01:24:36,158
Switch!

1093
01:24:36,192 --> 01:24:37,526
One, two...

1094
01:24:37,559 --> 01:24:39,158
- Three, four...
- Faster!

1095
01:24:39,192 --> 01:24:41,125
Five, six, seven, eight,

1096
01:24:41,158 --> 01:24:42,559
- Nine, ten...
- Come on, baby.

1097
01:24:42,592 --> 01:24:45,392

It's working, it's working...

1103
01:25:14,425 --> 01:25:15,692
I think.

1104
01:25:15,726 --> 01:25:17,125
It's okay.

1105
01:25:17,158 --> 01:25:18,526
- He's gonna be okay.
- Come on.

1106
01:25:18,559 --> 01:25:19,792
He's breathing.

1107
01:25:19,826 --> 01:25:22,559
We gotta get him
out of here. Rick!

1108
01:25:23,826 --> 01:25:26,526
Mom, he's gonna make it.

1109
01:25:26,559 --> 01:25:29,392
I need to take him
out of here.

1110

[distant chatter]

1112
01:25:44,692 --> 01:25:46,425
- This good?
- That's perfect.

1113
01:25:46,459 --> 01:25:49,526
As soon as more people come,
we need to get them registered.

1114
01:25:49,559 --> 01:25:50,659
- I can do that.
- Okay.

1115
01:25:50,692 --> 01:25:52,392
We need to call
the power company,

1116
01:25:52,425 --> 01:25:53,526
get them to shut
the grid down.

1117
01:25:53,559 --> 01:25:55,826
I can do that...

1118
01:25:55,859 --> 01:25:58,392
as soon as we get service.

1119
01:26:02,459 --> 01:26:05,259
She's gotta get to a hospital.

1120
01:26:05,292 --> 01:26:06,659
Can you take them?

1121
01:26:06,692 --> 01:26:08,659
I need to look for Peyton.

1122
01:26:08,692 --> 01:26:10,125
You're not coming?

1123
01:26:10,158 --> 01:26:11,526
I'm gonna keep looking
for Peyton.

1124
01:26:11,559 --> 01:26:14,125
Why don't I stay?

1125
01:26:14,158 --> 01:26:16,158
You two go.

1126
01:26:18,292 --> 01:26:19,692
Uh...

1127
01:26:21,158 --> 01:26:22,559
Are you sure?

1128
01:26:22,592 --> 01:26:24,292
Yeah.

1129
01:26:24,325 --> 01:26:25,559

I don't think
she could've survived that.

1199
01:33:07,292 --> 01:33:08,526
You just decided that?

1200
01:33:08,559 --> 01:33:10,125
There's no way
you could know that.

Mom. No, Mom.

01:35:30,425 --> 01:35:31,425
What's happening?

1232
01:35:31,459 --> 01:35:33,392
He's getting an ambulance ride.

1233
01:35:33,425 --> 01:35:36,158
You can fill that out.

1234
01:35:37,559 --> 01:35:40,392
Hey, he's gonna
make it, right?

1235
01:35:40,425 --> 01:35:42,392
- Are you...
- I'm her son.

1236
01:35:42,425 --> 01:35:44,158
No.

1237
01:35:50,158 --> 01:35:52,025
No, he is not.

1238
01:36:10,559 --> 01:36:12,559
Sir, you need to move.

1239
01:36:12,592 --> 01:36:14,559
Excuse us.

Ana...

1243
01:36:43,826 --> 01:36:47,259
Excuse me, I'm gonna ask you
to fill out this form for me

1244
01:36:47,292 --> 01:36:49,292
and get it back to me
as soon as you can.

1245
01:36:52,158 --> 01:36:53,058
Sì.

1246
01:37:00,826 --> 01:37:02,692
Ana, no.

1247
01:37:26,692 --> 01:37:29,292
It's okay.

1248
01:37:35,158 --> 01:37:37,158
Okay.

1249
01:37:50,726 --> 01:37:54,259

filling it in?

1250
01:37:54,292 --> 01:37:56,392
Huh?

1251
01:37:56,425 --> 01:37:59,025
No, I'm... I'm fine.

1252
01:38:03,692 --> 01:38:06,025
Is he undocumented?

1253
01:38:11,292 --> 01:38:13,592
Will they send him back?

1254
01:38:15,559 --> 01:38:18,259
Will they help him first if I...

1255
01:38:18,292 --> 01:38:19,792
Yes, yes.

1256
01:38:19,826 --> 01:38:22,192
But even so,
there will be costs.

1257
01:38:24,292 --> 01:38:27,259
You need to know
it could be a lot.

1258
01:38:27,292 --> 01:38:29,392
I understand.

1259
01:38:29,425 --> 01:38:31,692
Okay. I'll be right back.

1260
01:39:05,292 --> 01:39:06,559
Ana...

1261
01:39:09,425 --> 01:39:11,058
