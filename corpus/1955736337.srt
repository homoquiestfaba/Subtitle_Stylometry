1
00:00:56,757 --> 00:00:59,693
Ladies and gentlemen...

2
00:01:04,232 --> 00:01:06,634
Ely Braxton!

3
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,356
What you are about to see
is

4
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:31,625
ro-de-o history!

5
00:04:25,999 --> 00:04:28,336
-Hey, Joe.
-How's Ely?

6
00:04:28,369 --> 00:04:29,703
He's good.

7
00:04:34,442 --> 00:04:36,710
-Hey, how you doing?
-Hey, Joe.

8
00:04:36,744 --> 00:04:38,846
Did I leave the prescription?

9
00:04:38,879 --> 00:04:40,848
Just like a wedding night.

10
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:42,616
Not my wedding night.

11
00:04:44,084 --> 00:04:45,786
Here it is.

12
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:48,856
Let's get some coffee brewing.

13
00:04:51,058 --> 00:04:52,660
HANK: There.

14
00:04:54,928 --> 00:04:58,932
-There you go.
-Watch the leg.

15
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:02,703
Now's the best time for us to
get him thinking, while he's
got the pain.

16
00:05:02,736 --> 00:05:05,639
He's not gonna listen to
no doctor, and he's not
gonna listen to me.

17
00:05:05,673 --> 00:05:07,441
That makes two of us.

18
00:05:24,758 --> 00:05:29,463
Check it out, son!
It don't get better than this.

19
00:05:33,701 --> 00:05:35,936
You know, it's funny.

20
00:05:35,969 --> 00:05:37,838
It could've been anything,
from what I hear.

21
00:05:39,106 --> 00:05:42,710
Football, baseball, wrestling.

22
00:05:42,743 --> 00:05:44,845
You just chose bull riding,
is all.

23
00:05:44,878 --> 00:05:47,448
Could've chose anything.

24
00:05:48,549 --> 00:05:50,518
You still can, you know.

25
00:05:50,551 --> 00:05:52,420
No.

26
00:05:52,453 --> 00:05:54,522
Choosing time's come and gone.

27
00:05:55,923 --> 00:06:00,594
Well, maybe for riding bulls
or baseball,

28
00:06:00,628 --> 00:06:03,464
but there's all sorts of other
things to look forward to,

29
00:06:03,497 --> 00:06:05,365
all kinds of other choices
to make.

30
00:06:06,634 --> 00:06:09,770
Never chose bull riding,
Connie.

31
00:06:09,803 --> 00:06:12,506
It just sort of chose me.

32
00:06:13,974 --> 00:06:17,945
That might make it easier to
let it go then.

33
00:06:17,978 --> 00:06:20,881
-Don't you think?
-It might.

34
00:06:21,882 --> 00:06:24,485
We'll see.

35
00:06:24,518 --> 00:06:26,820
CONNIE: I don't think there's
any other way to see it.

36
00:06:26,854 --> 00:06:28,088
Are you two okay?

37
00:06:31,492 --> 00:06:33,160
CONNIE: The doctor was
pretty clear about that.

38
00:06:35,195 --> 00:06:36,430
ELY: Yeah.

39
00:06:38,899 --> 00:06:41,469
Go on, take it down.

40
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:44,071
-What?
-The poster.

41
00:06:44,104 --> 00:06:45,606
Take it down.

42
00:06:46,540 --> 00:06:47,841
You sure?

43
00:06:48,809 --> 00:06:50,444
I'm sure.

44
00:07:43,931 --> 00:07:46,233
HANK: I started out
a bull rider, ended up
a bullfighter.

45
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:49,002
Best goddamn decision
I ever made.

46
00:07:49,036 --> 00:07:51,505
PRCA bullfighting
hall-of-famer

47
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:53,040
and a few other things I could
mention if I wanted to.

48
00:07:54,007 --> 00:07:56,276
Hold up now.

49
00:07:56,309 --> 00:08:00,080
Point is, I've been doing this
for 15 years on both sides
of the chutes.

50
00:08:00,113 --> 00:08:04,117
I can tell you one thing for
certain, there's only two
ways to ride a bull.

51
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:07,087
You can either make it happen,
or you can let it happen.

52
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:09,823
There's been a few champs
that have made it happen

53
00:08:09,857 --> 00:08:14,962
but the really great riders,
the guys that have ridden
hard and long,

54
00:08:14,995 --> 00:08:17,865
guys like George Paul,
Gary Leffew,

55
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:20,534
those guys just let it happen.

56
00:08:20,568 --> 00:08:23,771
Are you giving them the
"you have to dance
with the bulls" speech again?

57
00:08:23,804 --> 00:08:27,207
Ladies and gentlemen,
my brother Ely Braxton
is back.

58
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:34,815
And he'll be the first
to tell you, it starts here.

59
00:08:34,848 --> 00:08:38,285
You've gotta clear your heart
and your head,

60
00:08:38,318 --> 00:08:42,022
so that when you get on
that bull, you've already won.

61
00:08:42,055 --> 00:08:45,726
It's just a dancing partner.
You just gotta be man enough
to let it lead.

62
00:08:45,759 --> 00:08:48,161
You've gotta be able to have
enough confidence in yourself,

63
00:08:48,195 --> 00:08:52,099
and faith that you can
sit back and let it happen.

64
00:08:52,132 --> 00:08:53,867
It's attitude, pure attitude.

65
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:57,137
Whether you're
making a putt,

66
00:08:57,170 --> 00:08:58,639
whether you're riding
a bull...

67
00:08:59,807 --> 00:09:00,741
Attitude.

68
00:09:00,774 --> 00:09:04,044
That's what separates
the best from the rest.

69
00:09:04,077 --> 00:09:06,680
-Let's go.
Clean up the arena.
-All right.

70
00:09:08,315 --> 00:09:09,683
Stay focused. Real simple.

71
00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:15,689
HANK: Remember what
we talked about.

72
00:09:15,723 --> 00:09:18,225
Clear your head.
Don't force anything on him.

73
00:09:18,258 --> 00:09:20,828
Just react, okay? Okay.

74
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:23,964
-He's ready to dance,
so are you.
-Okay, man, let's go.

75
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:48,622
(HORN BLOWS)

76
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:55,362
(HANK YELLS)

77
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,997
(BOTH LAUGHING)

78
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:59,332
Shit!

79
00:10:00,701 --> 00:10:02,803
Get up. We gotta go to work.

80
00:10:02,836 --> 00:10:05,072
-What?
-We gotta go to work.

81
00:10:09,042 --> 00:10:11,912
I gotta pick up Connie
to do the vaccines.

82
00:10:11,945 --> 00:10:14,114
You guys need anything else
from town?

83
00:10:14,147 --> 00:10:16,083
Shots already? Seems like
we just did them.

84
00:10:16,116 --> 00:10:18,251
-Always does.
-What?

85
00:10:18,285 --> 00:10:20,788
-The shots.
-The shots!

86
00:10:20,821 --> 00:10:22,890
Got it. We gotta do the shots.

87
00:10:22,923 --> 00:10:24,658
You started it, man.

88
00:10:26,359 --> 00:10:27,995
Thanks, Mom.

89
00:10:29,429 --> 00:10:31,131
Hey, Doc.

90
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:01,228
Hold. Hold. Okay, he's safe.

91
00:11:01,261 --> 00:11:04,464
-Where's Zapata?
-Who cares? He's a dud.

92
00:11:04,497 --> 00:11:07,367
No one's ever ridden him.
Besides, he needs
his vaccination.

93
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:09,336
You won him in a card game.

94
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,839
It don't matter.
He needs his vaccination.

95
00:11:11,872 --> 00:11:14,274
-Turn this one out
and go get him.
-All right.

96
00:11:16,043 --> 00:11:18,178
Move! Move!

97
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:23,751
Guys, roll up Zapata.
Move, bull.

98
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:28,421
Damn!
He's a big son of a buck.

99
00:11:28,455 --> 00:11:31,825
Yeah. I wouldn't worry
about him. He's all bark,
no bite.

100
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:35,428
I'm just gonna
center this for you.

101
00:11:40,400 --> 00:11:42,269
Ely!

102
00:11:42,302 --> 00:11:44,337
CONNIE: What the hell are
you doing? Get off!

103
00:11:45,538 --> 00:11:46,807
Ely!

104
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,376
What do you got, huh? Nothing!

105
00:11:49,409 --> 00:11:51,845
What you got? Nothing!

106
00:11:51,879 --> 00:11:54,114
Ely, get off the bull.

107
00:11:54,147 --> 00:11:56,183
-Get off!
-This thing can kick, man!

108
00:11:56,216 --> 00:11:59,386
Get off. You wanna
ride him, or you want me
to turn him out?

109
00:11:59,419 --> 00:12:01,154
Hell no. Turn him out.

110
00:12:01,188 --> 00:12:03,490
What are you talking about?
Get on this thing!

111
00:12:03,523 --> 00:12:05,826
-Ely, get off the bull.
-I'm getting off.

112
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:06,994
Go!

113
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:41,929
Watch out. Look at him.

114
00:12:53,073 --> 00:12:55,375
Nice dancing, brother.
He nipped you, too.

115
00:12:55,408 --> 00:12:58,278
Thank God for my sneakers.
That's one hell of an athlete.

116
00:13:01,448 --> 00:13:04,451
Number 24 and 21,

117
00:13:04,484 --> 00:13:06,119
pick up your orders.

118
00:13:07,087 --> 00:13:08,922
-What?
-Damn.

119
00:13:08,956 --> 00:13:11,091
I think I got a cavity.
Take this.

120
00:13:11,124 --> 00:13:13,827
-Do you put nutmeg
or clove on it?
-Clove.

121
00:13:13,861 --> 00:13:16,563
-How do you know?
It's nutmeg.
-It's definitely clove.

122
00:13:16,596 --> 00:13:19,232
-You're a vet, not a dentist.
-It's clove.

123
00:13:19,266 --> 00:13:21,234
-Excuse me.
-What do you want?

124
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:24,104
What do you put on a cavity,
nutmeg or clove?

125
00:13:24,137 --> 00:13:25,538
-Clove.
-She says nutmeg.

126
00:13:25,572 --> 00:13:27,507
You're still gonna have
to get that looked at.

127
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,910
Yeah, when I get back.

128
00:13:29,943 --> 00:13:31,912
-Back from where?
-Salinas.

129
00:13:31,945 --> 00:13:35,148
Hank's taking some bulls.
I thought I'd give him a hand.

130
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:38,218
Huh. When did you decide
on the Salinas thing?

131
00:13:38,251 --> 00:13:41,588
Well, I need a change.

132
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:44,992
I need to do something new.
The ranch is getting old.

133
00:13:45,025 --> 00:13:48,428
What's new about
a rinky-dink rodeo in Salinas?

134
00:13:48,461 --> 00:13:52,365
It's just about being there,
being with some of the guys
and being around it.

135
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:54,367
Well, that's not new.
That's old.

136
00:13:58,605 --> 00:14:01,508
If you want new,
I got plenty of ideas.

137
00:14:01,541 --> 00:14:02,876
Oh, yeah? Like what?

138
00:14:04,311 --> 00:14:07,080
You know,
you've been incredible.

139
00:14:07,114 --> 00:14:11,484
You got hurt, and just went
on getting better,
getting on with your life.

140
00:14:11,518 --> 00:14:13,586
You made it look
a lot easier than it's been.

141
00:14:15,022 --> 00:14:17,190
It's been hard, I know.
Hard as hell.

142
00:14:17,224 --> 00:14:20,360
Well, I got hurt sooner
than I wanted to.

143
00:14:20,393 --> 00:14:23,596
But sooner or later,
most guys get hurt.
That's just the way it is.

144
00:14:43,683 --> 00:14:45,085
You're gonna get carsick.

145
00:14:46,653 --> 00:14:48,555
Shit. I thought I downloaded
this stuff.

146
00:14:49,256 --> 00:14:50,490
What?

147
00:14:51,491 --> 00:14:53,293
There it is.

148
00:14:53,326 --> 00:14:56,629
"A used Huntley trailer
in excellent condition."

149
00:14:56,663 --> 00:14:59,666
I figure we can use Zapata
to frontline us up with PBR,

150
00:15:00,968 --> 00:15:03,036
five or six shows, and then...

151
00:15:05,538 --> 00:15:08,308
Yeah, that's plenty
for a down payment.

152
00:15:08,341 --> 00:15:11,411
Zapata's gonna be a star.
We're gonna get paid
our breeding fees.

153
00:15:11,444 --> 00:15:13,146
We might even get him on TV.

154
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:15,115
They got an agency
for that kind of shit.

155
00:15:25,592 --> 00:15:27,927
I bet you a hundred dollars
that no man can ride
that bull.

156
00:15:29,997 --> 00:15:31,698
I don't doubt your eye
for talent,

157
00:15:31,731 --> 00:15:34,467
but I got Put Hustead's bull
back in the pens.

158
00:15:34,501 --> 00:15:36,469
Ray, talk to him for me.

159
00:15:36,503 --> 00:15:40,207
How many times have
I driven all night to fill in
a slot for you guys?

160
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:43,343
I know that.
But I'm telling you,
Pat ain't gonna like this.

161
00:15:43,376 --> 00:15:46,513
Pat doesn't have to know
about it. This ain't
a sanctioned event.

162
00:15:46,546 --> 00:15:48,281
Hell, it's just
a draw pot, right?

163
00:15:50,383 --> 00:15:52,552
For Christ sakes, guys!
I'm talking about one bull!

164
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:09,469
Okay. This is what I'll do.

165
00:16:09,502 --> 00:16:11,738
I'll fight for you tomorrow,
free of charge.

166
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,675
All right. All right.

167
00:16:15,708 --> 00:16:17,710
I'll tell you what.

168
00:16:17,744 --> 00:16:20,747
You bring him, and if there's
any re-rides, he's in.

169
00:16:20,780 --> 00:16:22,382
How's that, huh?

170
00:16:23,716 --> 00:16:24,717

I'm sure Hank has the address
up there somewhere.

339
00:29:27,934 --> 00:29:29,235
This has nothing
to do with Dad.

340
00:29:32,604 --> 00:29:34,841
You're not him, Ely!
You're you!

341
00:29:35,374 --> 00:29:36,943
God bless you for that.

342
00:29:38,610 --> 00:29:39,879
Bye.

343
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:43,950
Bye.

344
00:30:03,602 --> 00:30:04,636
(LINE RINGING)

345
00:30:07,239 --> 00:30:09,441
This is Connie.
I'm not in right now.

346
00:30:09,475 --> 00:30:11,477
Leave me a message, or
you can try me at the clinic.

347
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:18,584
-No Connie?
-Nope.

348
00:30:22,588 --> 00:30:27,159
-Check the clinic?
-No. She's probably busy.

349
00:30:27,193 --> 00:30:30,229
Yeah, she's probably
with that doctor, getting rug
burns on her ass.

350
00:30:53,619 --> 00:30:54,921
What are you looking for?

351
00:30:57,689 --> 00:31:00,026
Oh, there's this girl I know.
She ain't there.

352
00:31:00,059 --> 00:31:02,428
-Is this her rig?
-It's pretty nice, isn't it?

353
00:31:02,461 --> 00:31:03,862
It's real nice.

354
00:31:22,581 --> 00:31:24,083
I want you to meet someone.
Come on.

355
00:31:25,351 --> 00:31:27,019
Hey, Celia.

356
00:31:27,053 --> 00:31:28,921
-How you doing?
-Good.

357
00:31:28,955 --> 00:31:31,123
You doing an exhibition
or something?

358
00:31:31,157 --> 00:31:34,560
I am selling barbecue sauce.

359
00:31:40,432 --> 00:31:42,534
There's someone
I want you to meet.

360
00:31:42,568 --> 00:31:45,037
-My brother, Ely.
-Nice to meet you.

361
00:31:45,071 --> 00:31:47,239
Nice to meet you.
You're the one
that hurt your head.

362
00:31:47,273 --> 00:31:48,975
-That's right.
-This is Sophie.

363
00:31:51,510 --> 00:31:54,046
What about having dinner
with us tonight?

364
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:55,047
Sounds good.

365
00:31:56,715 --> 00:31:58,384
You're on, Miss Jones.

366
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,352
Gotta go. Bye.

367
00:32:00,386 --> 00:32:01,687
(PHONE RINGING)

368
00:32:01,720 --> 00:32:04,923
Grab that for me. Push "talk."

369
00:32:05,657 --> 00:32:08,260
Hello?

370
00:32:08,294 --> 00:32:11,630
No, she's gone into the arena.
She'll be a minute.

371
00:32:11,663 --> 00:32:14,133
ANNOUNCER:
Here she is,
ladies and gentlemen,

372
00:32:14,166 --> 00:32:18,170
the world's champion,
Celia Jones.

373
00:32:18,204 --> 00:32:21,173
Damn. They better be paying
her a lot of money.

374
00:32:21,207 --> 00:32:23,509
The joke is,
she's a vegetarian.

375
00:32:23,542 --> 00:32:26,112
-I wouldn't have put you
two together.
-That's why it works.

376
00:32:27,046 --> 00:32:29,381
Tell you the truth,

377
00:32:29,415 --> 00:32:31,283
with a woman like that,
most guys are just scared
of them.

378
00:32:31,317 --> 00:32:33,619
Probably for a good reason,
don't you think?

379
00:32:33,652 --> 00:32:36,088
-Well, they gotta love
somebody.
-And that'd be you?

380
00:32:37,356 --> 00:32:38,390
Why not?

381
00:32:44,530 --> 00:32:45,331
Hello?

382
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:53,172
Hey, thanks.
I'm sorry. Dinner's off.

383
00:32:55,341 --> 00:32:57,543
Maybe we'll hook up
in Carson City or something.

384
00:32:58,710 --> 00:33:02,181
Sounds good. Nice to meet you.

385
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:03,549
-Bye, Celia.
-Bye-bye.

386
00:33:03,582 --> 00:33:05,717
See you later.

387
00:33:05,751 --> 00:33:09,255
ANNOUNCER: Well, stand back.
We got our bullfighters
over here.

388
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:11,023
Come on. Don't be late.

389
00:33:27,139 --> 00:33:28,140
(HORN BLOWS)

390
00:33:35,214 --> 00:33:36,515
-You okay?
-Yeah.

391
00:33:36,548 --> 00:33:39,118
ANNOUNCER:
The score coming up f
or Ely Braxton.

392
00:33:39,151 --> 00:33:41,287
Eighty-four points!

393
00:33:48,194 --> 00:33:49,495
Hey!
(WHISTLES)

394
00:33:56,435 --> 00:33:59,071
Dinner's back on if you guys
wanna hang out.

395
00:34:00,772 --> 00:34:02,341
That'd be great.
That'd be great.

396
00:34:04,710 --> 00:34:06,645
-Mario's at 8:00?
-Yeah.

397
00:34:09,348 --> 00:34:11,049
-Okay, bye.
-Bye.

398
00:34:22,494 --> 00:34:24,530
Seems stupid to bring
me along.

399
00:34:24,563 --> 00:34:27,199
Au contraire.
It's the slow approach.

400
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:32,838
In matters of love,
brotherly accompaniment
equals respect.

401
00:34:32,871 --> 00:34:35,207
You go in slow
like an iceberg

402
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:38,144
and by the time
she knows what's happening,
it's too late.

403
00:34:38,177 --> 00:34:39,811
That sounds more
like war than love.

404
00:34:39,845 --> 00:34:43,349
-Love is war.
-You're so romantic.

405
00:34:43,382 --> 00:34:45,317
How's your year been, Ely?

406
00:34:45,351 --> 00:34:47,586
-Pretty good.
-Yeah?

407
00:34:47,619 --> 00:34:50,722
He's been getting checks.
Wrangler called and made
him an offer.

408
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:53,725
They've really been beefing up
their budget this year.

409
00:34:53,759 --> 00:34:55,694
It's not exactly like
they're giving the money away.

410
00:34:58,164 --> 00:35:00,466
I don't know how you guys
deal with the judge thing.

411
00:35:00,499 --> 00:35:01,667
The judge thing?

412
00:35:01,700 --> 00:35:04,603
You know, the judges
give the scores.

413
00:35:04,636 --> 00:35:08,207
It's like ice skating
or boxing.
Where's the win in that?

414
00:35:10,709 --> 00:35:14,112
If you watched enough,
you'd be able to tell
the winners from the losers.

415
00:35:14,646 --> 00:35:16,515
Really?

416
00:35:16,548 --> 00:35:17,816
I'll take that, please.

417
00:35:21,487 --> 00:35:24,156
-Are you all through?
-Yes, thank you.

418
00:35:24,190 --> 00:35:27,559
I'm sorry.
We don't take credit cards.

419
00:35:27,593 --> 00:35:29,228
-You've gotta be kidding.
-I'm sorry.

420
00:35:32,664 --> 00:35:35,167
They call this a restaurant.

421
00:35:35,201 --> 00:35:37,303
I'm gonna take a pit stop.
I'll see you guys out front.

422
00:35:37,336 --> 00:35:39,771
Sure. It was nice to meet you.

423
00:35:39,805 --> 00:35:41,773
-You're not coming with us?
-No, I'm gonna walk.

424
00:35:42,741 --> 00:35:44,776
Okay. See you.

425
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:45,911
I'll meet you outside.

426
00:35:52,984 --> 00:35:56,188
-You got any cash?
-No. You said dinner was
on you.

427
00:35:56,222 --> 00:35:58,257
That's when I thought t
hey took credit cards.
I don't have any cash.

428
00:35:58,957 --> 00:36:00,726
Bit of a tight spot, eh?

429
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:03,595
Shit!

430
00:36:03,629 --> 00:36:05,497
Don't worry.
I'll take care of it.

431
00:36:06,932 --> 00:36:08,867
I love you,
you son of a bitch.

432
00:36:08,900 --> 00:36:10,369
Go get her.

433
00:36:14,940 --> 00:36:16,842
Oh, she loves that.

434
00:36:18,710 --> 00:36:21,713
-You ever get a massage?
-Every chance I get.

435
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:23,582
You?

436
00:36:23,615 --> 00:36:26,184
Once. It was kind of like
a gift certificate.

437
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:28,954
And?

438
00:36:28,987 --> 00:36:32,524
Son of a bitch damn near
put me in the hospital.

439
00:36:32,558 --> 00:36:34,393
And then during the whole
thing, I keep feeling
something dripping on me.

440
00:36:36,528 --> 00:36:38,930
Then I realized
the guy was sweating.

441
00:36:38,964 --> 00:36:40,266
It was a guy?

442
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:43,569
You got a massage from a guy?

443
00:36:45,737 --> 00:36:46,538
Yeah.

444
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:52,344
Not a sports massage. I mean,
I get massages from guys.

445
00:36:52,378 --> 00:36:53,312
I didn't know you guys did.

446
00:36:54,680 --> 00:36:57,316
Well, I didn't either.

447
00:37:03,622 --> 00:37:05,357
Give me a hand here?

448
00:37:08,927 --> 00:37:12,831
-Nicely done.
-Thanks.

449
00:37:12,864 --> 00:37:16,835
It was nice to meet
your brother. You guys
are pretty different, though.

450
00:37:16,868 --> 00:37:19,705
Yeah. Ely's a good kid.
He just gets tangled up
sometimes.

451
00:37:24,843 --> 00:37:26,412
Thanks for dinner.

452
00:37:27,012 --> 00:37:28,447
Good night.

453
00:37:30,782 --> 00:37:35,287
Hey, I was thinking about
that massage stuff
we were talking about earlier.

454
00:37:35,321 --> 00:37:38,390
The deal with that was,
it was a gift certificate

455
00:37:38,424 --> 00:37:40,392
and so I kind of felt awkward.

456
00:37:40,426 --> 00:37:42,594
'Cause if it were me,
you know,

457
00:37:42,628 --> 00:37:46,398
I would've asked
for someone else,
like a woman.

458
00:37:48,099 --> 00:37:51,737
You are so funny.
Don't worry about it.

459
00:37:51,770 --> 00:37:53,772
-Good night.
-Night.

460
00:38:20,065 --> 00:38:23,335
I don't know, man.
She gives me a bad feeling.

461
00:38:23,369 --> 00:38:25,437
Why?

462
00:38:25,471 --> 00:38:26,605
She never looks you
in the eye.

463
00:38:28,907 --> 00:38:30,442
She's shy.

464
00:38:31,477 --> 00:38:33,512
That's part of why I love her.

465
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:35,013
Yeah? What's the other part?

466
00:38:36,948 --> 00:38:38,417
You know, I've been thinking.

467
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:43,755
I don't think this clown
thing's helping me.

468
00:38:43,789 --> 00:38:45,824
You're not a clown.
You're a bullfighter.

469
00:38:47,526 --> 00:38:50,629
Well, next time we go out,

470
00:38:50,662 --> 00:38:53,031
remind me to talk more
about the stock contracting.

471
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:54,366
Gee, that'll grab her.

472
00:38:57,636 --> 00:39:00,071
Any woman that makes you feel
like you have to explain
yourself

473
00:39:00,105 --> 00:39:01,640
is the wrong woman.

474
00:39:14,152 --> 00:39:18,924
-Where the hell did you
pick that up?
-My feet?

475
00:39:18,957 --> 00:39:22,528
Ever watch that James Bond
movie where they painted
that lady in gold?

476
00:39:22,561 --> 00:39:25,431
-She suffocated.
-I thought it was
lead poisoning.

477
00:39:26,798 --> 00:39:30,035
No. Her skin couldn't breathe,
something like that.

478
00:39:30,068 --> 00:39:32,003
Shit, I don't know.
I've just always done it.

479
00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:41,580
Hey.

480
00:39:42,448 --> 00:39:43,348
What?

481
00:39:45,116 --> 00:39:46,918
What's the old man been up to
these days?

482
00:39:47,853 --> 00:39:50,021
I don't know.

483
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,890
Probably just waiting around
to go to hell.

484
00:39:58,196 --> 00:39:59,565
Do you think he knows?

485
00:40:04,670 --> 00:40:07,639
I mean,
do you think he knows
how we've done?

486
00:40:14,012 --> 00:40:15,180
Probably.

487
00:40:29,728 --> 00:40:32,230
Gotta do it, boy.
He ain't going nowhere.

488
00:40:32,263 --> 00:40:34,933
-He might make it.
-Come on!

489
00:40:34,966 --> 00:40:37,669
This is your last chance
to put some hair
on your balls.

490
00:40:37,703 --> 00:40:39,571
-He's gonna make it!
-Get outta here.

491
00:40:40,572 --> 00:40:42,007
Ely, come here, boy.

492
00:40:53,552 --> 00:40:54,853
Good night, little big man.

493
00:41:16,074 --> 00:41:17,809
Hey, hey.

494
00:41:17,843 --> 00:41:20,178
Come on, Ely. You all right?

a funny smell, but she had
the best body I ever saw.

This is Connie. I'm not
in right now. Please leave
a message.

Poor Randy Frost has drawn
Zapata, the unridden bull.

Randy gets started,

00:42:25,944 --> 00:42:27,646
but whoop, he's down!

502
00:42:35,186 --> 00:42:38,123
Now in the winners' circle,
we see the familiar faces
of Ely Braxton

503
00:42:38,156 --> 00:42:40,158
along with Celia Jones,
with another buckle.

I ever thought I was gonna get

back home," Braxton said.

00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:18,196
-I never said that.
I never said that.
-Here we go.

508
00:43:18,229 --> 00:43:21,933
"Ely blames his busy schedule
on keeping he and his father
apart.

509
00:43:23,702 --> 00:43:25,904
"Although he says
he phones him often."

510
00:43:25,937 --> 00:43:28,339
Damn, that is such bullshit.

511
00:43:28,373 --> 00:43:31,777
Relax, cowboy. I'm just
enjoying some fine journalism.

512
00:43:34,012 --> 00:43:35,881
They always find a way
to bring Dad into it.

513
00:43:46,124 --> 00:43:47,893
-Hey, how are you?
-How are you?

514
00:43:47,926 --> 00:43:50,628
-Are you guys in the rodeo?
-Yes.

515
00:43:52,898 --> 00:43:54,900
What's this?
Do you want me to sign it?

516
00:44:02,874 --> 00:44:04,810
How you guys doing?

517
00:44:06,211 --> 00:44:07,713
About ready to go?

518
00:44:26,765 --> 00:44:29,367
You coming in or going out?

519
00:44:29,400 --> 00:44:31,002
Great. Great.

520
00:44:57,162 --> 00:44:58,296
Son of a bitch.

521
00:45:00,431 --> 00:45:03,501
Sorry. Did I wake you?

522
00:45:03,534 --> 00:45:06,437
'Cause I was just trying
to figure out, while you were
having fun last night,

523
00:45:06,471 --> 00:45:09,908
I spent my night freezing
my ass off in this truck.

524
00:45:09,941 --> 00:45:13,444
Yeah. And while you've
been sleeping, I've had to do
all the driving.

525
00:45:13,478 --> 00:45:15,246
I'd like to know how
the hell that works.

526
00:45:15,280 --> 00:45:16,948
It works well.

527
00:45:19,250 --> 00:45:20,418
I bet it does.

528
00:45:33,031 --> 00:45:34,099
-Hey.
-I don't believe it.

529
00:45:35,233 --> 00:45:36,768
How are you?

530
00:45:36,802 --> 00:45:38,236
Ooh. How are you?

531
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:40,538
Good. It went well.

532
00:45:40,571 --> 00:45:43,541
I'm glad to hear that.

533
00:45:43,574 --> 00:45:45,777
-Where's your brother?
-Right behind me.

534
00:45:47,478 --> 00:45:49,881
I'm gonna go put
some coffee on. Be right back.

535
00:45:55,020 --> 00:45:57,455
Hey, Ma. What do you think?

536
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,324
-Whose it is?
-It's mine.

537
00:46:00,025 --> 00:46:00,859
Yours?

538
00:46:02,961 --> 00:46:05,263
-You look like hell, kid.
-Thanks.

539
00:46:05,296 --> 00:46:06,497
You look great, as always.

540
00:46:11,236 --> 00:46:14,806
Come here. Give me a hug.

541
00:46:14,840 --> 00:46:17,175
You're all in one piece, huh?
Are you?

542
00:46:17,208 --> 00:46:19,210
Yep, I'm great. You all right?

543
00:46:19,244 --> 00:46:23,414
-Yeah, I'm all right.
-Let's go.

544
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:27,886
I think I'm gonna sign
a contract with Wrangler,
Ford, and Bud Light.

545
00:46:27,919 --> 00:46:31,389
He's got Southwest coupons,
too. He's been doing
really good.

546
00:46:31,422 --> 00:46:33,491
A good showing in Nashville
ought to sew up the PBR

547
00:46:33,524 --> 00:46:36,361
and then he can quit
and come back and help us
with the ranch.

548
00:46:36,394 --> 00:46:39,397
Maybe. But there's always
something to be said
for sticking with it.

549
00:46:39,430 --> 00:46:41,266
I wanna keep my edge.

550
00:46:41,299 --> 00:46:43,068
Well, we could use your help
back here too.

551
00:46:44,602 --> 00:46:47,238
Maybe I'll do like
a back-and-forth or something.

552
00:46:47,272 --> 00:46:49,274
Let's not get
all confused about

553
00:46:49,307 --> 00:46:52,077
what people are doing
or aren't doing.

554
00:46:52,110 --> 00:46:54,112
Joe and I are working out
just fine here.

555
00:46:55,446 --> 00:46:57,182
You and Joe, huh?

556
00:46:57,215 --> 00:46:58,884
Things getting a little lonely
at the ranch?

557
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:09,861
You best not forget
what's important.

558
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,968
Home, sweet home.

559
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,151
-Hi.
-Hi.

560
00:47:34,319 --> 00:47:36,321
That's my shirt.

561
00:47:36,354 --> 00:47:38,890
You're wearing my T-shirt.

562
00:47:38,924 --> 00:47:41,126
-What are you doing here?
-I'm home for the Fourth.

563
00:47:41,159 --> 00:47:43,628
-Oh...
-Here, I got this for you.

564
00:47:43,661 --> 00:47:47,165
-Thanks.
-Go on. Open it.

565
00:47:47,198 --> 00:47:49,067
Connie, do we have
a miniature Phillips-head
screwdriver?

566
00:47:51,402 --> 00:47:54,005
Gene, you guys remember
each other? Ely.

567
00:47:56,274 --> 00:47:57,275
Sure.

568
00:47:57,976 --> 00:48:00,045
Howdy.

569
00:48:00,078 --> 00:48:03,348
These model 1740s,
it takes a degree
to figure them out.

570
00:48:03,381 --> 00:48:06,117
Do we have one of those
little, tiny, miniature...

571
00:48:06,151 --> 00:48:07,052
Under the sink.

572
00:48:08,419 --> 00:48:10,956
Excuse me?

573
00:48:10,989 --> 00:48:12,523
There's a toolbox
under the sink
with a screwdriver in it.

574
00:48:14,359 --> 00:48:15,593
Great. Thanks.

575
00:48:22,133 --> 00:48:24,002
-Is that yours?
-Yeah. You like it?

576
00:48:24,669 --> 00:48:26,071
It's nice.

577
00:48:29,975 --> 00:48:31,709
You wanna come inside?
We're just hanging out.

578
00:48:31,742 --> 00:48:33,211
No, thanks.
Maybe another time.

579
00:48:36,982 --> 00:48:39,317
Why don't you just
come back tomorrow,
bring this.

580
00:48:39,350 --> 00:48:41,086
We'll make a plan,
try to do this right.

581
00:48:46,457 --> 00:48:47,592
No, thanks.

582
00:48:49,027 --> 00:48:50,695
You're incredible!

583
00:48:50,728 --> 00:48:53,531
You're gone for two months,
you don't even call

584
00:48:53,564 --> 00:48:56,267
and then you show up
out of the blue and act
like I'm a bitch.

585
00:48:56,301 --> 00:48:59,170
-I called a lot.
-No, you didn't.

586
00:48:59,204 --> 00:49:01,239
-You only called once.
-That's not true.

587
00:49:01,272 --> 00:49:03,674
I left a message once.
I called lots of times.

588
00:49:03,708 --> 00:49:05,710
Oh, that is lame!

589
00:49:05,743 --> 00:49:07,945
I can't believe you!
That is so lame!

590
00:49:27,398 --> 00:49:29,667
If Zapata keeps rolling
along the way he is,

591
00:49:29,700 --> 00:49:33,238
I'd like to take some
of that cash, maybe put
something together.

592
00:49:33,271 --> 00:49:35,173
Like a book?

593
00:49:35,206 --> 00:49:38,176
I was thinking more
like a video. I want something
that says it all.

594
00:49:38,209 --> 00:49:40,211
There's a lot of guys teaching
a lot of different things,

595
00:49:40,245 --> 00:49:42,580
but it's all based
on power and strength.

596
00:49:42,613 --> 00:49:45,016
There's nothing wrong
with a little effort.

597
00:49:45,050 --> 00:49:49,054
Are you kidding me?
Have you seen some
of these guys in the chutes?

598
00:49:49,087 --> 00:49:52,457
All muscled up.
They don't know a single thing
about bull riding.

599
00:49:52,490 --> 00:49:56,194
Take Denny Presser,
for example. Pulls his biceps
clean off the bone.

600
00:49:56,227 --> 00:49:58,563
Never thinks
he's gonna ride again.

601
00:49:58,596 --> 00:50:02,333
I work with him, get him
to focus on balance,
stretching, visualization.

602
00:50:02,367 --> 00:50:04,602
He wins the PBR
two years later.

603
00:50:04,635 --> 00:50:07,305
Oh, come on!
You know that final went
to whoever drew Meathead.

604
00:50:09,307 --> 00:50:12,310
I think I'd give Denny
a little more credit
than that.

605
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:14,279
He's one out of three guys
who rode him that year.

606
00:50:14,312 --> 00:50:16,247
That was luck of the draw.

607
00:50:16,281 --> 00:50:20,618
Ely, it takes a lot of heart
and skill to ride a bull.

608
00:50:20,651 --> 00:50:22,620
All I'm saying is,
I'm just sick and tired

609
00:50:22,653 --> 00:50:25,423
of these bull riders
with bad attitudes
and bad habits.

610
00:50:25,456 --> 00:50:28,159
It's getting like
I can tell already
who's gonna get injured.

611
00:50:28,193 --> 00:50:31,262
-That's bullshit!
-Ely!

612
00:50:31,296 --> 00:50:34,132
-You don't know
who's gonna get hurt.
-Sure, I do.

613
00:50:34,165 --> 00:50:38,203
It's the power guys,
using the Mitchell technique,
slapping themselves around.

614
00:50:38,236 --> 00:50:40,705
-Just like Dad did.
-All right, Mr. Expert.

615
00:50:40,738 --> 00:50:43,441
What are you gonna tell
Ronnie Kitchens about getting
his face rearranged?

616
00:50:43,474 --> 00:50:45,276
That was the bull.

617
00:50:45,310 --> 00:50:46,777
Fine. Then what are you gonna
tell me?

618
00:50:50,615 --> 00:50:52,383
If you don't smarten up
and start listening,

619
00:50:52,417 --> 00:50:54,752
you're gonna get hurt again,
real bad.

620
00:50:54,785 --> 00:50:57,355
You know what?
I've had it
with all your talking.

621
00:50:57,388 --> 00:51:01,192
My brother loves to go on
and on about this and that,
all day long.

622
00:51:01,226 --> 00:51:04,095
Who made you the expert
anyway, huh?

623
00:51:04,129 --> 00:51:08,166
Besides, Dad got
two money titles.
When did you win anything?

624
00:51:08,199 --> 00:51:10,235
-That's enough!
-You bet it is.

625
00:51:15,206 --> 00:51:18,576
Whatever point you are trying
to make, you just ruined
that dinner!

626
00:51:18,609 --> 00:51:20,645
I didn't ruin that dinner.
Hank did.

627
00:51:20,678 --> 00:51:22,447
And if nobody can see that,
then forget it!

628
00:51:23,648 --> 00:51:25,516
Get back here. Come here.

629
00:51:25,550 --> 00:51:29,120
-This isn't like you.
-Yeah? Maybe it is.

630
00:51:29,154 --> 00:51:31,422
Maybe I'm finally taking up
my place in the world

631
00:51:31,456 --> 00:51:33,358
instead of wandering around
like a goddamn ghost.

632
00:51:33,391 --> 00:51:35,092
Get in here! Come on back!

633
00:51:43,334 --> 00:51:45,436
Eddie, you know he won
all the big ones, right?

634
00:51:45,470 --> 00:51:48,839
-Sure did.
-Cheyenne, Calgary, Denver.

635
00:51:48,873 --> 00:51:52,477
All of them except the finals.
Placed high, but he never
won it.

636
00:51:52,510 --> 00:51:54,412
-Who, your pops?
-Yeah.

637
00:51:54,445 --> 00:51:58,416
It's like Jim Kelly,
Dan Marino. Something's always
gonna be missing.

638
00:51:58,449 --> 00:52:01,919
Hell. Finals back then was
just another rodeo.

639
00:52:01,952 --> 00:52:04,722
PBR was just a pipe dream.

640
00:52:04,755 --> 00:52:07,858
I don't think your daddy
or the rest of us gave
a second goddamn thought.

641
00:52:07,892 --> 00:52:10,428
Yeah, well, hell,
everything's different now.

642
00:52:10,461 --> 00:52:13,764
Everything. Just look at
the old films.

643
00:52:13,798 --> 00:52:16,467
The bulls were pussies
compared to the bulls
we ride now.

644
00:52:16,501 --> 00:52:18,669
These bulls we ride,
they're killers.

645
00:52:18,703 --> 00:52:21,406
-They're killers!
-Looks pretty much
the same to me.

646
00:52:21,439 --> 00:52:23,441
-You don't know shit.
-Come on!

647
00:52:23,474 --> 00:52:25,843
Break it up, goddamn it!
Come on!

648
00:52:25,876 --> 00:52:27,912
Oh, shit.
What the hell happened?

649
00:52:27,945 --> 00:52:29,547
I didn't touch him!

650
00:52:47,698 --> 00:52:51,202
DOCTOR: We have to find out.
It could be a number
of things.

651
00:52:51,236 --> 00:52:53,804
An injury in the past years.

652
00:52:53,838 --> 00:52:56,974
It could be a hemorrhage
from the hits he took
over the past months.

653
00:52:57,007 --> 00:52:59,644
Or maybe from the one tonight.

654
00:53:01,946 --> 00:53:05,883
-I didn't realize
it was that serious.
-Hard to tell.

655
00:53:05,916 --> 00:53:10,421
-I still think he should
stay overnight.
-I sort of have already.

656
00:53:10,455 --> 00:53:12,657
At least come back tomorrow
for more blood work

657
00:53:12,690 --> 00:53:14,392
and X ray follow-up.

658
00:53:14,425 --> 00:53:15,226
Okay.

659
00:53:16,427 --> 00:53:18,463
Prednisone. Take with food.

660
00:53:23,768 --> 00:53:25,436
And no more bulls, young man.

661
00:53:29,740 --> 00:53:31,442
-Thank you, Doctor.
-Night.

662
00:53:35,580 --> 00:53:37,615
Your shirt's all screwed up.

663
00:53:44,021 --> 00:53:46,291
You know when
I'm talking and stuff?

664
00:53:47,425 --> 00:53:49,727
I'm not talking about you.

665
00:53:49,760 --> 00:53:51,962
That conversation about you,

666
00:53:51,996 --> 00:53:54,432
that's a whole other deal.

667
00:53:54,465 --> 00:53:56,267
Don't make me have it
with you now.

668
00:53:57,535 --> 00:53:59,870
-Come back tomorrow?
-Yeah.

669
00:53:59,904 --> 00:54:01,872
-You all right?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

670
00:54:01,906 --> 00:54:03,641
Let's get outta here.

671
00:54:14,319 --> 00:54:16,354
Hey. I'll give you
a ride down.

672
00:54:16,387 --> 00:54:17,422
No, I'm all right. Thanks.

673
00:54:19,424 --> 00:54:20,858
What do you mean?
You don't want the company?

674
00:54:22,427 --> 00:54:23,828
Not unless you're going
to Salt Lake.

675
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:27,598
Salt Lake City?

676
00:54:27,632 --> 00:54:30,468
-You're going
to Salt Lake City rodeo?
-Yeah.

677
00:54:30,501 --> 00:54:32,770
Jesus Christ, Ely!
Didn't you listen to what
the doctor said?

678
00:54:32,803 --> 00:54:35,573
I feel fine. Whatever they
gave me, it worked.

679
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,274
-Don't do that!
-You listen to me!

680
00:54:40,578 --> 00:54:44,415
If you go now, in the shape
you're in, you are going to be
killing yourself.

681
00:54:44,449 --> 00:54:47,318
And if I do, it'll be me
doing it, okay?

682
00:54:47,352 --> 00:54:50,388
Not you, not Mom, Connie.

683
00:54:50,421 --> 00:54:51,322
Me.

684
00:54:54,058 --> 00:54:56,661
Christ, I can't do
this anymore.

685
00:54:56,694 --> 00:54:58,429
This is your deal, not mine.

686
00:55:07,938 --> 00:55:09,474
You know,

687
00:55:13,478 --> 00:55:17,382
maybe you can explain
to me why it always had to be
your deal or my deal,

688
00:55:18,983 --> 00:55:21,352
why it never could just
be ours.

689
00:55:25,423 --> 00:55:26,757
I don't know.

690
00:56:13,471 --> 00:56:16,541
Back office says
we need to take
a wait-and-see attitude.

691
00:56:16,574 --> 00:56:18,676
Granted, you're a great story
with the comeback,

692
00:56:18,709 --> 00:56:21,045
but we only sponsor guys
who make the finals.

693
00:56:21,078 --> 00:56:23,814
-I'm going to the finals!
-I know that.

694
00:56:23,848 --> 00:56:27,485
It's a formality.
Just a few spots up
in the rankings is all.

695
00:56:27,518 --> 00:56:29,487
-We're rooting for you.
-Yeah, right.

696
00:56:31,689 --> 00:56:33,524
I'll see you around.

697
00:56:43,133 --> 00:56:47,438
Check it out, son.
It don't get better than this.

698
00:57:08,493 --> 00:57:09,994
Hey, comeback kid!

699
00:57:10,895 --> 00:57:12,129
Come here.

700
00:57:13,197 --> 00:57:14,965
Give me a hand, cowboy.

701
00:57:18,503 --> 00:57:22,172
Whoa! Easy, cowboy.
There's a foot in there.

702
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:30,881
-Like them?
-They're nice.

703
00:57:30,915 --> 00:57:34,552
Why don't you talk to the rep?
You're high up, aren't you?

704
00:57:34,585 --> 00:57:36,721
-Top five.
-That's what I thought.

705
00:57:39,657 --> 00:57:41,726
What does someone like you do
when there's no one around?

706
00:57:44,028 --> 00:57:45,095
I find someone.

707
00:57:46,063 --> 00:57:47,498
Right.

708
00:57:50,267 --> 00:57:53,938
Out of the five dates
you've had with my brother,
you came through on only one.

709
00:57:56,273 --> 00:57:57,642
Is that true?

710
00:57:59,143 --> 00:58:01,646
Jesus, I have no life.

711
00:58:02,079 --> 00:58:03,480
It's true!

712
00:58:05,282 --> 00:58:08,886
What's with the score keeping?
You got a notebook somewhere?

713
00:58:08,919 --> 00:58:10,988
If you saw what it does
to him, you wouldn't need
a notebook.

714
00:58:14,058 --> 00:58:17,595
You're making me feel bad.
Your brother's a good man.

715
00:58:17,628 --> 00:58:18,696
You bet.

716
00:58:20,931 --> 00:58:22,767
You want a drink?

717
00:58:22,800 --> 00:58:24,201
I'll see you around.

718
00:58:49,126 --> 00:58:51,762
-Hey, Doc?
-It popped.

719
00:58:51,796 --> 00:58:54,732
Okay, hold on.
Let him get his feet up.

720
00:58:55,933 --> 00:58:57,334
(YELLING)

721
00:58:57,367 --> 00:58:59,236
It's gonna hurt. Ready?

722
00:59:00,871 --> 00:59:02,306
(CRACKING)

723
00:59:02,339 --> 00:59:05,009
Every time you pop that out,
you're making it worse.

724
00:59:05,042 --> 00:59:07,011
What do you want me to do?

725
00:59:07,044 --> 00:59:08,846
Try landing on
your left shoulder.

726
00:59:11,015 --> 00:59:13,784
-This is for the pain.
-Good old Dr. Hack.

727
00:59:13,818 --> 00:59:17,154
No, I don't want
a prescription. I need
something now for the pain.

728
00:59:17,187 --> 00:59:21,225
You boys are gonna have
to learn how to ride better.
I gave them all away.

729
00:59:21,258 --> 00:59:23,260
Let's get outta here.

730
00:59:23,293 --> 00:59:25,295
You gave them to who?
I never seen you give
a pill to no one.

731
00:59:26,664 --> 00:59:29,033
Next!

732
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:31,802
-Rooster!
-Hey, boys, what's going on?

733
00:59:34,004 --> 00:59:36,240
-I got something
for that pain.
-What do you got?

734
00:59:36,273 --> 00:59:37,808
I got some good stuff.

735
01:00:10,274 --> 01:00:12,710
What a nice surprise!

736
01:00:15,680 --> 01:00:18,048
Excellent timing, Connie.

737
01:00:18,082 --> 01:00:19,650
Thank you.

738
01:00:21,852 --> 01:00:23,888
-It's been too long!
-I know.

739
01:00:27,024 --> 01:00:29,359
Listen, I came out here 'cause

740
01:00:29,393 --> 01:00:30,961
I was thinking that...

741
01:00:33,063 --> 01:00:35,199
I don't know how to say this,
but you know,

742
01:00:35,232 --> 01:00:37,868
when you break up
with someone,

743
01:00:37,902 --> 01:00:40,705
it's not just the two of you,
it's everyone else too.

744
01:00:43,107 --> 01:00:46,110
And I was thinking
that maybe it doesn't have
to be that way.

745
01:00:46,143 --> 01:00:50,948
I must have picked up
that telephone 20 times
to call you.

746
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:54,118
As far as Ely goes,
you did the right thing.

747
01:00:55,152 --> 01:00:57,988
Most of us just go on and on,

748
01:00:58,022 --> 01:01:02,727
taking whatever comes,
not asking for more.

749
01:01:02,760 --> 01:01:05,696
But you have a right
to expect more,
'cause you deserve it.

750
01:01:08,132 --> 01:01:09,366
Thanks.

751
01:01:13,838 --> 01:01:15,873
Hank and his shiny new toy!

752
01:01:17,174 --> 01:01:19,777
-Wow!
-What do you think?

753
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:23,413
-It's gonna be a shame
to get it dirty.
-Mom tell ya?

754
01:01:23,447 --> 01:01:27,084
-Hank's got a contract
for Bakersfield.
-Congratulations.

755
01:01:27,117 --> 01:01:31,155
Thanks. We're leaving when
I get these bulls loaded.
I'll stop on my way back.

756
01:01:32,022 --> 01:01:33,290
See ya.

757
01:01:59,083 --> 01:01:59,884
(DOOR KNOCKING)

758
01:02:03,487 --> 01:02:06,757
-Hey, how you doing?
-I'm good. How are you?

759
01:02:06,791 --> 01:02:10,494
I was wondering
if maybe you wanted
to get a bite to eat.

760
01:02:10,527 --> 01:02:14,231
How sweet.
This is my sister Debbie.

761
01:02:15,900 --> 01:02:17,367
Hi. Nice to meet you.
Ely Braxton, ma'am.

762
01:02:17,401 --> 01:02:20,337
Nice to meet you, Ely Braxton.

763
01:02:20,370 --> 01:02:22,907
Why don't you come in
and have some ice cream
with the girls?

764
01:02:22,940 --> 01:02:25,876
Come on.
Get your butt in here.

765
01:02:25,910 --> 01:02:28,512
Honey, you cannot call
that a dress!

766
01:02:28,545 --> 01:02:30,915
I can so! It was a dress!

767
01:02:30,948 --> 01:02:36,053
Last year I give her
a Victoria's Secret
gift certificate.

768
01:02:36,086 --> 01:02:37,788
Do you know
what she buys herself?

769
01:02:38,889 --> 01:02:41,325
Overalls. Can you imagine?

770
01:02:41,358 --> 01:02:46,363
Why would anyone buy
themselves work clothes
out of that catalog?

771
01:02:46,396 --> 01:02:50,935
It's a little like buying
yourself a hot dog
in a French restaurant.

772
01:02:50,968 --> 01:02:52,903
Aren't you clever!

773
01:02:52,937 --> 01:02:56,506
Our mama always thought
she would be happier as a man.

774
01:02:56,540 --> 01:03:00,845
That is a lie! That is a lie.
That is not true.

775
01:03:00,878 --> 01:03:03,513
-It is too true.
-It is not.

776
01:03:03,547 --> 01:03:07,484
-What's the matter with you?
-You're trying to pick up
this boy...

777
01:03:07,517 --> 01:03:10,287
We're just having a good time.
I'm not trying to pick him up.

778
01:03:10,320 --> 01:03:13,123
-He knows a woman
when he sees one.
-Flashing your titties?

779
01:03:13,157 --> 01:03:17,828
Honey, I'm sorry!
I'm sorry if I'm a real woman!

780
01:03:17,862 --> 01:03:22,099
Why would a man go
for a hamburger
when he can get a big sirloin?

781
01:03:22,132 --> 01:03:24,401
-You okay to drive home?
-Yeah.

782
01:03:27,237 --> 01:03:28,338
Ah!

783
01:03:28,372 --> 01:03:30,340
What a nightmare!

784
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:36,413
I like her.

785
01:03:36,446 --> 01:03:38,983
Oh, yeah? I bet you do.

787
01:03:43,120 --> 01:03:44,922
I gotta use the phone
before I go!

788
01:03:45,422 --> 01:03:46,423
No!

789
01:03:47,291 --> 01:03:49,059
Why?

790
01:03:49,093 --> 01:03:51,328
Because you're a pain
in the ass.

791
01:03:51,361 --> 01:03:53,130
Stupid, selfish little bitch!

792
01:03:54,331 --> 01:03:55,332
Be good.

793
01:03:56,500 --> 01:03:57,902

you looking at?

01:04:00,637 --> 01:04:04,141
Joe, stop here.
I'm just gonna be a minute.

795
01:04:12,950 --> 01:04:14,919
Leave us alone!

01:05:28,025 --> 01:05:30,027
Talk to him.

Let's just go.
Come on, let's go.

798
01:06:04,528 --> 01:06:07,131
I thought I was pretty clear
on the phone.

799
01:06:07,164 --> 01:06:12,236
Yeah, I know, Hank,
but I already penciled you in.
I suppose I just...

800
01:06:12,269 --> 01:06:14,738
I don't know.
I figured since you was here,
you'd be fighting.

801
01:06:14,771 --> 01:06:17,641
You knew what this meant
to me.

802
01:06:17,674 --> 01:06:21,245
This was supposed to be
my first full-on deal
as a contractor.

803
01:06:21,278 --> 01:06:24,381
Hey, it's just a little more
dinero. Right?

804
01:06:24,414 --> 01:06:26,650
What the hell's wrong
with that? Huh?

805
01:06:27,751 --> 01:06:29,286
For Christ's sake!

806
01:06:32,256 --> 01:06:34,358
Fine.

that war.

01:07:05,589 --> 01:07:07,124
That's Zapata!

812
01:07:07,157 --> 01:07:08,592
Where you been?

813
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:10,260
You don't want to know.

01:07:42,592 --> 01:07:46,096

Eighty-eight points!
What a ride! Eighty-eight!

01:08:12,322 --> 01:08:14,524
You pull a stunt like
that again and you're out
of the loop. You got it?

818
01:08:17,827 --> 01:08:20,530
What the heck was that?
What the hell are you doing?

819
01:08:20,564 --> 01:08:22,532
I was gonna ask you
the same thing.

820
01:08:22,566 --> 01:08:26,736
You do not come back
to the ranch. Understand me?
No more.

821
01:08:26,770 --> 01:08:30,307
You wanna know what kind
of a father you got?
Take a look in the mirror!

822
01:08:32,909 --> 01:08:34,844
Yeah. That's what I thought.

823
01:08:43,753 --> 01:08:46,156
I was wondering when
you were gonna show me
that temper.

824
01:08:46,823 --> 01:08:48,124
Let's go load the bulls.

825
01:10:27,056 --> 01:10:29,259
Hi, handsome.

826
01:10:31,895 --> 01:10:35,699
I'm taking Zapata
and the other bulls down
to PBR in Vegas.

827
01:10:35,732 --> 01:10:39,836
-I figure, when in Rome...
-Great. This calls
for a celebration.

828
01:10:39,869 --> 01:10:43,340
-What do you wanna do?
-Um, pie? Louanne's?

829
01:10:44,841 --> 01:10:45,842
Okay. Park.

830
01:10:51,881 --> 01:10:53,650
Wow.

831
01:10:53,683 --> 01:10:55,585
It's the frosting.
Don't you think?

832
01:10:55,619 --> 01:10:56,820
Must be.

833
01:10:58,622 --> 01:11:00,290
You seem really good.

834
01:11:00,324 --> 01:11:03,259
I am. I'm okay. How about you?

835
01:11:04,761 --> 01:11:05,629
I'm good.

836
01:11:06,630 --> 01:11:07,931
And bad.

837
01:11:07,964 --> 01:11:09,533
And bad and good.

838
01:11:13,737 --> 01:11:15,305
Do you see him much?

839
01:11:15,905 --> 01:11:17,307
Not really.

840
01:11:19,476 --> 01:11:20,477
How is he?

841
01:11:23,680 --> 01:11:25,615
I don't know. He seems okay.

842
01:11:32,789 --> 01:11:34,958
You know,

843
01:11:34,991 --> 01:11:39,763
in a different world,
you and I would've made
a lot more sense.

844
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:43,800
Yeah. In a different world.

845
01:11:55,745 --> 01:11:57,347
Mr. PBR!

846
01:11:57,381 --> 01:11:59,549
Hey, you're in!

847
01:11:59,583 --> 01:12:01,951
Yeah, that was close.
I got lucky, I guess.

848
01:12:01,985 --> 01:12:04,721
You did not get lucky.

849
01:12:04,754 --> 01:12:07,056
I'm gonna come with you.
We're gonna do something sick
in Vegas.

850
01:12:07,090 --> 01:12:09,393
What? You wanna get married?

851
01:12:09,426 --> 01:12:10,560
Who knows?

852
01:12:10,594 --> 01:12:13,863
Oh, get this!
Ray is looking for you.

853
01:12:13,897 --> 01:12:16,900
-TNN wants an interview.
-Don't do that.

854
01:12:16,933 --> 01:12:19,669
I'm sorry. Aren't you excited?

855
01:12:19,703 --> 01:12:22,038
Say something! You're the man!

856
01:12:22,071 --> 01:12:24,140
Vegas! It's yours!

857
01:12:24,173 --> 01:12:28,144
-Did you get any other calls?
-You keep asking me that.

858
01:12:28,177 --> 01:12:32,048
I was hoping to hear
from Hank. We always go
to the finals together.

859
01:12:40,524 --> 01:12:44,060
-Take the phone. Call him.
-I don't want the phone.

860
01:12:44,093 --> 01:12:46,463
You are really hung up
on the past.

861
01:12:46,496 --> 01:12:49,933
You should just get rid
of this big brother,
little brother, father shit.

862
01:12:49,966 --> 01:12:51,768
It is not helping you.

863
01:12:51,801 --> 01:12:56,039
You are almost at the top now.
You don't need all this crap.

864
01:12:56,072 --> 01:12:59,809
Maybe you should deal with it.
Hank will be at the finals
with his bulls.

865
01:12:59,843 --> 01:13:00,944
Just face it.

866
01:13:15,792 --> 01:13:20,096
Ely, I would hold off
on those pills
until after the interview.

867
01:13:21,565 --> 01:13:24,100
So now I have to pay you
to be my manager?

868
01:13:25,602 --> 01:13:27,604
Oh, my God!

869
01:13:27,637 --> 01:13:29,806
What the hell is with you?

870
01:13:29,839 --> 01:13:32,208
Nothing.

871
01:13:32,241 --> 01:13:35,011
For the last few days,
you've made me feel like
I've done something wrong.

872
01:13:35,044 --> 01:13:36,546
You didn't do anything wrong.

873
01:13:37,881 --> 01:13:39,549
Then what is it?

874
01:13:44,253 --> 01:13:46,523
Are you gonna be mad
at me for wanting you
instead of him?

875
01:13:48,224 --> 01:13:50,860
If you are, you should
let me know.

876
01:13:50,894 --> 01:13:53,863
I got better things to do
than follow you to Vegas
and be treated like shit.

877
01:14:08,712 --> 01:14:12,982
Hey, Hank! Ely's gonna be
on television any minute!

878
01:14:13,016 --> 01:14:14,217
Come on.

879
01:14:17,587 --> 01:14:19,923
Ely, it's been
an impressive year.

880
01:14:19,956 --> 01:14:22,158
Did you really think you'd
have a shot
at the championship?

881
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:25,495
It's important to take it
one bull at a time.

882
01:14:25,529 --> 01:14:28,632
When I came up,
your dad was the man.

883
01:14:28,665 --> 01:14:32,902
He looked like he was
in control all the time, and
I see a little of that in you.

884
01:14:32,936 --> 01:14:35,171
That can't be helped, I guess.

885
01:14:35,204 --> 01:14:38,207
Good genes, they'll only take
you so far.

886
01:14:38,241 --> 01:14:42,145
Did you pick up any words
of wisdom from your dad?

887
01:14:42,178 --> 01:14:44,247
Sure, you bet. Lots of things.

888
01:14:44,280 --> 01:14:46,883
- Share them with us.
-This ought to be interesting.

889
01:14:46,916 --> 01:14:50,153
Not to think too much,
to stay centered,

890
01:14:50,186 --> 01:14:53,723
get through the eight seconds
the best you can
and cowboy up.

891
01:14:53,757 --> 01:14:57,927
All right. Thanks, Ely.
Good luck, and give Pops
my best.

892
01:14:57,961 --> 01:15:03,232
Ely Braxton, he's
my dark horse pick for the PBR
championships in Las Vegas.

893
01:15:03,266 --> 01:15:04,534
I'm Donnie Gay for TNN.

894
01:15:19,182 --> 01:15:21,685
Hey, can I ask you something?

895
01:15:25,021 --> 01:15:27,824
If things were reversed,
would Hank have given me
up for you?

896
01:15:29,993 --> 01:15:31,194
Yeah, he would have.

897
01:15:36,800 --> 01:15:38,534
Take care of yourself,
all right?

898
01:17:36,252 --> 01:17:37,687
(BELL DINGING)

899
01:17:53,036 --> 01:17:57,073
Again Ely Braxton
with another powerful ride.
How did it feel?

900
01:17:57,106 --> 01:17:59,876
It felt great.
I'm just rocking
along as usual.

901
01:17:59,909 --> 01:18:02,746
Well, rocking along,
it was a great ride, Ely.

902
01:18:02,779 --> 01:18:05,949
Your next draw,
your brother's bull,
the bad boy, Zapata.

903
01:18:05,982 --> 01:18:07,283
What do you think about him?

904
01:18:12,088 --> 01:18:16,059
That seemed to even get
his attention, Pam.

905
01:18:16,092 --> 01:18:18,061
But in all honesty,
that bull is a bad one.

906
01:18:19,328 --> 01:18:20,730
(YELLING)

907
01:18:43,186 --> 01:18:43,987
Hey.

908
01:18:49,158 --> 01:18:50,459
That's something new.

909
01:18:53,963 --> 01:18:55,899
Tell me something.

910
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:58,768
At least...

911
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:02,371
At least tell me all this
had to do with love.

912
01:19:08,444 --> 01:19:11,414
You know, Ray swears
Zapata was luck of the draw.

913
01:19:15,218 --> 01:19:16,319
Yeah.

914
01:19:19,388 --> 01:19:20,890
What do you think?

915
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:24,961
Me?

916
01:19:24,994 --> 01:19:27,363
I thought you might have me
set up for the ass-kicking
I deserve.

917
01:19:44,480 --> 01:19:45,781
What's this?

918
01:19:48,517 --> 01:19:49,853
It's Dad's address.

919
01:19:55,524 --> 01:19:57,126
It's not far from here.

920
01:20:06,335 --> 01:20:07,937
You got your work
cut out for you.

921
01:20:17,981 --> 01:20:18,982
Hey, Hank.

922
01:20:34,330 --> 01:20:36,165
I could really use your help
with this one.

923
01:20:44,273 --> 01:20:47,510
Ely, you gotta lighten
your load.

924
01:20:50,179 --> 01:20:53,983
All that shit you've been
hanging on to for,
Jesus Christ,

925
01:20:55,518 --> 01:20:56,953
God only knows how long.

926
01:20:58,054 --> 01:20:59,455
You gotta let it go.

927
01:21:03,059 --> 01:21:04,327
If you wanna ride Zapata,

928
01:21:06,329 --> 01:21:07,931
you've gotta drop everything
and everyone

929
01:21:10,133 --> 01:21:11,467
that isn't you.

930
01:21:14,603 --> 01:21:16,339
Then you'll be fine.

931
01:21:19,608 --> 01:21:21,677
We both know
you can ride anything.

932
01:21:21,710 --> 01:21:23,612
You'll be fine.

933
01:21:23,646 --> 01:21:24,647
Hey.

934
01:21:27,616 --> 01:21:28,884
I'm sorry.

935
01:21:36,625 --> 01:21:37,893
That's a start.

936
01:21:41,197 --> 01:21:42,431
You be careful.

937
01:21:43,499 --> 01:21:45,001
And I love you.

ANNOUNCER:
It don't get better than this.

939
01:23:19,828 --> 01:23:21,264
What the hell?

940
01:23:23,532 --> 01:23:26,435
-What time is it?
-It's late.

941
01:23:26,469 --> 01:23:30,039
You guys got the shits
of a life.

942
01:23:30,073 --> 01:23:32,241
Least ways, you didn't bring
no camera with you this year.

943
01:23:33,709 --> 01:23:36,112
What the hell?

944
01:23:36,145 --> 01:23:38,547
Suppose you better come on in.
Come on.

945
01:23:41,550 --> 01:23:43,752
Same thing every year.

946
01:23:43,786 --> 01:23:48,324
I know when it's finals time,
when you reporters start
coming round.

947
01:23:48,357 --> 01:23:50,659
-I'm not a reporter.
-What the hell are you then?

948
01:23:52,695 --> 01:23:56,132
-I'm a bull rider.
-Oh! A cowboy, huh?

949
01:23:56,165 --> 01:23:59,368
I used to ride bulls,
real ones.

950
01:23:59,402 --> 01:24:04,807
Not this corn-fed,
feedlot pussies you see
nowadays.

951
01:24:04,840 --> 01:24:07,210
Come on, sit yourself down.
Have a seat.

952
01:24:08,477 --> 01:24:09,745
Go on through.

953
01:24:11,614 --> 01:24:15,151
Get kids like you
in here asking for advice.

954
01:24:15,184 --> 01:24:18,487
I don't got much to tell them
except you gotta fight
that damn bull

955
01:24:18,521 --> 01:24:21,490
like he's just crawled out
of your sweetheart's bed.

956
01:24:21,524 --> 01:24:25,528
You gotta hate that sucker,
and then you gotta hate him
some more.

957
01:24:25,561 --> 01:24:28,731
It's a goddamn war,
is what it is.

958
01:24:28,764 --> 01:24:31,700
And you're a damn fool
if you think it's otherwise.

959
01:24:31,734 --> 01:24:34,603
Let me show you
this here thing.
Now, where is that...

960
01:24:34,637 --> 01:24:38,141
Where is that thing I put...
There it is.

961
01:24:38,174 --> 01:24:40,343
Wait a minute now.
Look at this.

962
01:24:41,844 --> 01:24:47,183
That's Wyoming, 1969.
I won that.

963
01:24:47,216 --> 01:24:50,286
I was out the night before
with the boys, tomcatting.

964
01:24:51,754 --> 01:24:53,556
That's a hell of a town
for that.

965
01:24:53,589 --> 01:24:56,492
We left that bar,
went straight to the rodeo.

966
01:24:56,525 --> 01:24:59,428
I didn't know whether
I was coming or going.

967
01:24:59,462 --> 01:25:02,465
And damn me if I didn't win
that damned thing.

968
01:25:02,498 --> 01:25:05,368
You just sit right here.
Wait one minute.

969
01:25:05,401 --> 01:25:08,103
I got something, I just put
my hands to it here.

970
01:25:09,638 --> 01:25:12,575
Where the hell did I put
those sons of bitches?

971
01:25:12,608 --> 01:25:15,211
There they are.

972
01:25:15,244 --> 01:25:18,814
Well, almost out of them.

973
01:25:18,847 --> 01:25:21,317
I got one left.
You can have it.

974
01:25:21,350 --> 01:25:23,486
There you are, son.
What do you think of that?

975
01:25:26,389 --> 01:25:30,359
Just a minute. Just a minute.
Let me have that.

976
01:25:30,393 --> 01:25:32,561
What did you say
your name was, cowboy?

977
01:25:34,330 --> 01:25:35,130
Ely.

978
01:25:36,632 --> 01:25:37,633
Ely?

979
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:43,239
Ely what?

980
01:25:45,808 --> 01:25:47,276
Just Ely.

981
01:25:47,943 --> 01:25:49,545
Just plain old Ely?

982
01:25:50,879 --> 01:25:52,715
There you go.

983
01:25:52,748 --> 01:25:57,486
"From Reid Braxton
to just old Ely."

984
01:25:57,520 --> 01:26:00,589
Now, son, you take care
of that. That's gonna be worth
a lot of money someday.

985
01:26:02,725 --> 01:26:05,194
Want another beer?
I'll get you another beer.

986
01:26:05,228 --> 01:26:07,363
Yep, one more beer coming up.

Wow, you're there.

990
01:26:33,356 --> 01:26:34,957
-Ely?
- Afraid so.

991
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:41,230
-Where are you?
- Somewhere near Vegas.

992
01:26:41,264 --> 01:26:42,431
Been up all night?

993
01:26:45,033 --> 01:26:46,835
Is there still a chance
for the two of us?

994
01:26:48,371 --> 01:26:49,805
You're the one
that's gambling.

995
01:26:51,774 --> 01:26:53,509
Am I?

996
01:26:56,612 --> 01:26:59,482
-Good luck tonight.
-Thanks. I'll need it.

997
01:27:00,583 --> 01:27:01,717
You're watching, right?

998
01:27:04,787 --> 01:27:05,721
I don't know.

999
01:27:06,922 --> 01:27:08,291
But good luck.

1000
01:27:09,825 --> 01:27:11,294

started this competition
last Thursday

1010
01:27:46,329 --> 01:27:48,397
and after three go-arounds,

1011
01:27:48,431 --> 01:27:53,035
the top 15 heroes qualified
for tonight's finals!

1012
01:27:53,068 --> 01:27:55,771
And here they are!

1013
01:27:57,640 --> 01:27:59,007
Heath Hanson.

1014
01:28:00,843 --> 01:28:02,411
Carl Hudson.

1015
01:28:04,079 --> 01:28:06,048
John Mortenson.

1016
01:28:07,783 --> 01:28:09,618
Andre Nelson.

1017
01:28:11,954 --> 01:28:13,422
Chris Shaw.

1018
01:28:14,823 --> 01:28:16,325
Donny Ray Howard.

1019
01:28:18,627 --> 01:28:20,629
Ely Braxton.

1020
01:28:32,675 --> 01:28:35,110
Each and every one of them
can walk away

1021
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:39,648
with over half a million
dollars worth of prize money
tonight

1022
01:28:39,682 --> 01:28:43,652
if they make it through
the eight seconds safe
and sound.

1023
01:28:43,686 --> 01:28:46,622
But it won't be that easy,
as you know.

1024
01:28:46,655 --> 01:28:49,124
Because each and every one
of our heroes

1025
01:28:49,157 --> 01:28:52,595
will ride the rankest,

1026
01:28:52,628 --> 01:28:56,932
the meanest bulls known
to mankind!

1027
01:28:56,965 --> 01:29:00,903
Give our heroes a hand
and include them
in your prayers!

1028
01:29:00,936 --> 01:29:02,738
God bless them,

1029
01:29:02,771 --> 01:29:06,108
and God bless America!

1030
01:29:11,947 --> 01:29:15,384
PAM: (ON TV) Welcome back
to the PBR Finals,
live from Las Vegas.

1031
01:29:15,418 --> 01:29:18,821
Donnie, the action
has been exciting.
Do you have any predictions?

1032
01:29:18,854 --> 01:29:22,591
DONNIE: Well, Eric Black's
been on a run since Cheyenne.

1033
01:29:22,625 --> 01:29:24,693
And you know
what momentum means when
you come to the PBR Finals.

1034
01:29:24,727 --> 01:29:26,895
Best bulls, best bull riders.

1035
01:29:26,929 --> 01:29:29,432
But you gotta take
the injuries into account.

1036
01:29:29,465 --> 01:29:33,669
Like Weathers and Franks,
they're hurting.
You gotta look to Ely Braxton.

1037
01:29:33,702 --> 01:29:36,839
PAM: He's gotten by one bull
but what about this draw
in the next round?

1038
01:29:36,872 --> 01:29:39,041
DONNIE: It's the classic
good news/bad news story.

1039
01:29:39,074 --> 01:29:41,944
He knows the bull because
he belongs to his brother.
The bad news,

1040
01:29:41,977 --> 01:29:45,814
the bull's Zapata. Unridden,
and maybe the most dangerous
animal on earth.

1041
01:29:45,848 --> 01:29:48,617
PAM: He's got his hands
full, but what makes that bull
so tough?

1042
01:29:48,651 --> 01:29:50,986
DONNIE: Pam, he's got
a lot of moves,

1043
01:29:51,019 --> 01:29:54,657
but in reality, he's just
so dangerous, it makes
it real hard to concentrate.

1044
01:29:54,690 --> 01:29:56,625
PAM: As we wait for that ride,
let's move
to chute number three.

1045
01:31:17,039 --> 01:31:19,642
Ely Braxton!

1046
01:32:52,200 --> 01:32:53,902
(BELL DINGING)

1047
01:32:53,936 --> 01:32:55,270
(ALL CHEERING)

1048
01:33:01,076 --> 01:33:01,877
Whoo!

1049
01:33:12,387 --> 01:33:14,222
Get him off!

1050
01:33:24,132 --> 01:33:24,933
(SCREAMING)

1051
01:34:13,348 --> 01:34:14,349
No!

1052
01:36:33,421 --> 01:36:34,957
(SOBBING)

1053
01:37:19,467 --> 01:37:21,169
Ma!

1054
01:37:21,203 --> 01:37:22,905
Hey, Zapata.

1055
01:37:24,439 --> 01:37:25,874
Get out of the way, Joe.

1056
01:37:26,408 --> 01:37:27,910
Rose!

1057
01:37:30,345 --> 01:37:31,880
Ma!

1058
01:37:31,914 --> 01:37:36,919
-Wait, think about this.
-Rose, Rose.

1059
01:37:36,952 --> 01:37:39,854
Mom, put the gun down.
Come on, put the gun down.

1060
01:37:41,223 --> 01:37:43,325
Please. Come on.

1061
01:37:43,358 --> 01:37:45,493
This isn't going
to bring him back.

1062
01:37:46,428 --> 01:37:47,362
It's okay.

1063
01:37:55,703 --> 01:37:58,673
Come on.
I'll take care of this, okay?

1064
01:37:58,706 --> 01:38:00,608
Come on, put it down.

1065
01:38:00,642 --> 01:38:02,577
Come on, it's okay.

1066
01:38:07,449 --> 01:38:08,917
(SOBBING)

1067
01:38:35,077 --> 01:38:37,079
All right, Joe, come on.
Let's go.

1068
01:39:26,494 --> 01:39:28,696
You sure you wanna do this?

1069
01:39:28,730 --> 01:39:30,298
Yeah. Let him out.

1070
01:40:28,790 --> 01:40:30,292
That's what he would've done.

1071
01:40:31,426 --> 01:40:32,660
Yeah.

1072
01:40:36,731 --> 01:40:38,100
Come on.
