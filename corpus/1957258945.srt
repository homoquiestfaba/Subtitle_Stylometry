1
00:00:00,519 --> 00:00:03,436
(thunder rumbling)

4
00:00:19,539 --> 00:00:20,608
- [Rob] Until that day,

5
00:00:20,608 --> 00:00:24,959
I'd always been skeptical
about the concept of fate,

6
00:00:24,959 --> 00:00:27,448
believing that there's little in our lives

7
00:00:27,448 --> 00:00:29,520
truly beyond our control.

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:32,086
But since then, I've had experiences

9
00:00:32,086 --> 00:00:35,760
too impossible to be
accredited to mere chance.

10
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,459
There've been three of these moments

11
00:00:37,459 --> 00:00:41,729
that have defined my life
and redefined my beliefs.

12
00:00:41,729 --> 00:00:46,479
That afternoon at the airport
meeting her, was the first.

13
00:00:49,545 --> 00:00:50,378
- Glad you made it.

14
00:00:50,378 --> 00:00:51,211
- How pressed for time are we here?

15
00:00:51,211 --> 00:00:52,939
- Very, we got about 25 minutes at most.

16
00:00:52,939 --> 00:00:53,848
- All right, well I apologize,

17
00:00:53,848 --> 00:00:55,288
but as you know, we need a water source,

18
00:00:55,288 --> 00:00:56,597
so we're gonna have to
show you the prototype

19
00:00:56,597 --> 00:00:58,488
in the men's room, rig it up to the sink.

20
00:00:58,488 --> 00:00:59,321
While you're being amazed,

21
00:00:59,321 --> 00:01:00,648
I'll get everything wrapped up here.

22
00:01:00,648 --> 00:01:01,915
- Great.

23
00:01:01,915 --> 00:01:02,748
- This is it.

24
00:01:02,748 --> 00:01:04,998
- Let's see what it can do.

25
00:01:07,429 --> 00:01:08,262
- And as you know,

26
00:01:08,262 --> 00:01:10,405
there was a couple of problems
we were having initially.

27
00:01:10,405 --> 00:01:11,325
The timing mechanism was off

28
00:01:11,325 --> 00:01:13,997
and it was directly
related to the hydro input.

29
00:01:13,997 --> 00:01:16,165
Now, since the firing has to be exact,

30
00:01:16,165 --> 00:01:17,495
well we just bled off

31
00:01:17,495 --> 00:01:20,149
a percentage of the
used water before evap.

32
00:01:20,149 --> 00:01:21,247
And we are so accurate,

33
00:01:21,247 --> 00:01:22,557
that we only had to compromise

34
00:01:22,557 --> 00:01:25,978
two pieces of the 600 samples that we ran.

35
00:01:25,978 --> 00:01:26,877
- Incredible.

36
00:01:26,877 --> 00:01:29,544
- And we're ready to fire it up.

37
00:01:31,007 --> 00:01:34,924
(dramatic instrumental music)

38
00:01:49,197 --> 00:01:50,114
48 seconds.

39
00:02:02,296 --> 00:02:03,378
- Excuse me?

40
00:02:03,378 --> 00:02:04,211
- Yeah.

41
00:02:04,211 --> 00:02:07,378
- Are you in the business or a workaholic?

42
00:02:07,378 --> 00:02:09,545
- Both, actually, sort of.

43
00:02:10,997 --> 00:02:11,957
- I was just wondering because I need

44
00:02:11,957 --> 00:02:13,816
to update the system
that my business uses,

45
00:02:13,816 --> 00:02:16,416
and I really don't know much
about that sort of thing.

46
00:02:16,416 --> 00:02:17,589
- [Rob] Well, it's not really my area,

47
00:02:17,589 --> 00:02:21,158
but I know some people with
whom I could put you in contact.

48
00:02:21,158 --> 00:02:23,108
- Oh, I'm sorry, I'm Leslie.

49
00:02:23,108 --> 00:02:24,268
- Rob.

50
00:02:24,268 --> 00:02:26,326
So are you coming or going?

51
00:02:26,326 --> 00:02:27,687
- [Leslie] I just got back.

52
00:02:27,687 --> 00:02:28,668
- So you live here?

53
00:02:28,668 --> 00:02:29,668
- That I do.

54
00:02:30,775 --> 00:02:31,775
- Fabulous.

55
00:02:35,574 --> 00:02:36,772
- This is really good.

56
00:02:36,772 --> 00:02:37,605
Perfect, actually.

57
00:02:37,605 --> 00:02:38,557
Is this really it?

58
00:02:38,557 --> 00:02:40,493
- [Rob's friend] Check it out, you'll see.

59
00:02:40,493 --> 00:02:42,018
This'll blow 'em away.

60
00:02:42,018 --> 00:02:42,993
- Should have everyone's attention

61
00:02:42,993 --> 00:02:45,204
once you tell them what
this thing is capable of.

62
00:02:45,204 --> 00:02:46,801
- We're just amazed how much
power you're able to contain

63
00:02:46,801 --> 00:02:48,429
in such a compact area.

64
00:02:48,429 --> 00:02:50,400
- Well, we just fill the order.

65
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,448
You have to carry the ball from here.

66
00:02:52,448 --> 00:02:53,527
- You know, I could never figure out

67
00:02:53,527 --> 00:02:55,892
how anyone could stand
that kind of monotony.

68
00:02:55,892 --> 00:02:58,133
- Day in, day out, year after year.

69
00:02:58,133 --> 00:02:59,753
- How do you live in such an amazing world

70
00:02:59,753 --> 00:03:01,833
and never want to leave your front porch?

71
00:03:01,833 --> 00:03:03,578
- Resignation to contentment.

72
00:03:03,578 --> 00:03:06,001
We have become a society
that aspires to mediocrity

73
00:03:06,001 --> 00:03:07,389
out of the fear of failure.

74
00:03:07,389 --> 00:03:09,821
Remember, unfaltering commitment
is a double-edged sword.

75
00:03:09,821 --> 00:03:12,581
The greater the determination,
the more likely the success.

76
00:03:12,581 --> 00:03:13,800
But for those who don't achieve,

77
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,937
the more cognizant they
are of their failure.

78
00:03:15,937 --> 00:03:17,110
The bigger they are the harder they fall

79
00:03:17,110 --> 00:03:19,289
applies to ambitions as well.

80
00:03:19,289 --> 00:03:21,109
And sure, the rewards are greater,

81
00:03:21,109 --> 00:03:23,901
but the costs escalate proportionately.

82
00:03:23,901 --> 00:03:27,230
The upside is it's that
necessary assiduous desire

83
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:29,222
and a little bit of talent to back it up

84
00:03:29,222 --> 00:03:32,156
that makes anything possible.

85
00:03:32,156 --> 00:03:33,619
- You seem determined, that's for sure.

86
00:03:33,619 --> 00:03:36,623
And I suspect the talent as well.

87
00:03:36,623 --> 00:03:40,604
- Well, I've always had the
benefit of knowing what I want.

88
00:03:40,604 --> 00:03:41,935
- I have recently found myself

89
00:03:41,935 --> 00:03:45,018
in the same situation,
very recently, in fact.

90
00:03:48,269 --> 00:03:49,184
- What is it?

91
00:03:49,184 --> 00:03:50,624
- This man thinks there's a couple of men

92
00:03:50,624 --> 00:03:52,666
in the terminal with a
bomb in their possession.

93
00:03:52,666 --> 00:03:53,874
- I'm not sure it was a bomb,

94
00:03:53,874 --> 00:03:55,810
nobody said anything
about it being a bomb,

95
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:57,701
but they sure seemed
like they meant business.

96
00:03:57,701 --> 00:03:58,534
- Where was it?

97
00:03:58,534 --> 00:03:59,367
- In the bathroom.

98
00:03:59,367 --> 00:04:01,825
- Yeah, I was in the bathroom
in one of the stalls.

99
00:04:01,825 --> 00:04:03,270
- That is so weird.

100
00:04:03,270 --> 00:04:05,182
I have never met anyone who
has ever even heard of him,

101
00:04:05,182 --> 00:04:07,318
let alone read and understood him.

102
00:04:07,318 --> 00:04:08,228
- It was awkward at first,

103
00:04:08,228 --> 00:04:09,061
getting over the fact

104
00:04:09,061 --> 00:04:10,671
that everything he wrote is figurative.

105
00:04:10,671 --> 00:04:12,847
I think not having a constant in the work

106
00:04:12,847 --> 00:04:14,089
would scare off most readers.

107
00:04:14,089 --> 00:04:16,347
- Oh no, but that's what's fascinated me.

108
00:04:16,347 --> 00:04:18,085
You feel such a sense of jubilation

109
00:04:18,085 --> 00:04:19,503
when the picture comes together,

110
00:04:19,503 --> 00:04:20,336
and the next paragraph,

111
00:04:20,336 --> 00:04:22,276
you find yourself starting from scratch.

112
00:04:22,276 --> 00:04:24,368
Drowning truths having
dissolved into metaphor.

113
00:04:24,368 --> 00:04:25,884
- And abstract metaphors at that.

114
00:04:25,884 --> 00:04:27,794
It's probably why he's never
had a book over 80 pages.

115
00:04:27,794 --> 00:04:28,794
- Probably.

116
00:04:28,794 --> 00:04:29,841
- Can you wait around a minute?

117
00:04:29,841 --> 00:04:30,960
I've got to take care of this,

118
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,721
but I don't want you running off on me.

119
00:04:32,721 --> 00:04:34,009
- Sure.

120
00:04:34,009 --> 00:04:34,842
- Well?

121
00:04:34,842 --> 00:04:35,681
- It's everything you said it was.

122
00:04:35,681 --> 00:04:37,868
To be honest, I didn't think
you'd be able to make it work.

123
00:04:37,868 --> 00:04:39,354
- You keep it just short of impossible,

124
00:04:39,354 --> 00:04:40,301
prepare to be amazed.

125
00:04:40,301 --> 00:04:42,457
- I'm beginning to think
so, but this is the big one.

126
00:04:42,457 --> 00:04:44,116
This is gonna make us both a lot of money.

127
00:04:44,116 --> 00:04:45,206
- I just need enough to keep him

128
00:04:45,206 --> 00:04:46,649
in crayons and coloring books,

129
00:04:46,649 --> 00:04:49,245
with the occasional shock therapy.

130
00:04:49,245 --> 00:04:50,310
- Did you get all the stats transferred?

131
00:04:50,310 --> 00:04:51,906
- I did, it just about
filled your hard drive.

132
00:04:51,906 --> 00:04:53,238
The documents are in
there we'll need signed

133
00:04:53,238 --> 00:04:54,878
to start work on the full size unit.

134
00:04:54,878 --> 00:04:57,122
- The bookkeepers and lawyers
will have to handle all that.

135
00:04:57,122 --> 00:04:58,090
Once I throw this in everyone's lap

136
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:00,742
and get showered with
praise, my job's done.

137
00:05:00,742 --> 00:05:02,370
- Are you sure you don't want
to take the box with you?

138
00:05:02,370 --> 00:05:03,203
Show 'em yourself?

139
00:05:03,203 --> 00:05:04,482
- My word's good enough.

140
00:05:04,482 --> 00:05:05,800
Who would question me?

141
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:06,883
- Good point.

142
00:05:10,012 --> 00:05:11,478
- Excellent job, he's sold.

143
00:05:11,478 --> 00:05:12,917
- Hey, I'm a closer.

144
00:05:12,917 --> 00:05:14,854
- Can you give me a minute?

145
00:05:14,854 --> 00:05:16,568
- Don't you mean two minutes?

146
00:05:16,568 --> 00:05:17,694
- I'm sorry about that.

147
00:05:17,694 --> 00:05:19,278
- It was the reason you were here.

148
00:05:19,278 --> 00:05:20,445
- That it was.

149
00:05:24,338 --> 00:05:26,380
- [Cop #1] Put it down!
[Cop #2] Don't move!

150
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:27,286
- Is this multiple choice?

151
00:05:27,286 --> 00:05:29,816
- [Cop #1] I said, put it down.

152
00:05:29,816 --> 00:05:32,016
- [Cop #3] It's over, man.

153
00:05:32,016 --> 00:05:33,380
- [Rob's Friend] I'm just a hostage.

154
00:05:33,380 --> 00:05:34,404
Shoot him.

155
00:05:34,404 --> 00:05:35,237
- [Rob] Don't say it.

156
00:05:35,237 --> 00:05:36,496
This is not the time.

157
00:05:36,496 --> 00:05:38,629
- [Cop #1] Lay down on the ground.

158
00:05:38,629 --> 00:05:40,629
Hands behind your head.

159
00:05:42,501 --> 00:05:44,636
- Whoa whoa, wait a minute, wait a minute.

160
00:05:44,636 --> 00:05:46,364
- This is bad, this is bad.

161
00:05:46,364 --> 00:05:47,447
- Other arm.

162
00:05:50,817 --> 00:05:52,325
- [Rob] Wait a minute, this is a mistake.

163
00:05:52,325 --> 00:05:54,575
How do I get a hold of you?

164
00:05:55,799 --> 00:05:59,382
(soft instrumental music)

165
00:06:04,932 --> 00:06:08,889
- Well, I guess somebody
owes you guys an apology.

166
00:06:08,889 --> 00:06:11,588
Suppose that falls on me.

167
00:06:11,588 --> 00:06:12,505
Sorry guys.

168
00:06:14,249 --> 00:06:15,889
How about that ride to the airport?

169
00:06:15,889 --> 00:06:16,722
Sounds great.

170
00:06:16,722 --> 00:06:17,555
- Okay.

171
00:06:17,555 --> 00:06:19,916
- Look, anything I can
ever do, you just ask.

172
00:06:19,916 --> 00:06:21,356
- Thanks, stay frosty.

173
00:06:21,356 --> 00:06:22,356
- We'll try.

174
00:06:33,598 --> 00:06:34,510
- Hey, grab the stuff.

175
00:06:34,510 --> 00:06:35,343
- Sure.

176
00:06:43,343 --> 00:06:46,346
- Hi, I'm Rob, has a
message been left for me?

177
00:06:46,346 --> 00:06:47,655
- No, no message here.

178
00:06:47,655 --> 00:06:49,415
You could try it information, though.

179
00:06:49,415 --> 00:06:50,415
- Thank you.

180
00:06:55,894 --> 00:06:57,895
- [Cashier] I'll help whoever's next.

181
00:06:57,895 --> 00:06:58,895
- I'm sorry.

182
00:06:59,963 --> 00:07:01,732
I don't think I heard you correctly.

183
00:07:01,732 --> 00:07:03,946
Did you say I'll help whoever's next?

184
00:07:03,946 --> 00:07:06,542
Or did you say, I'll help
whatever inconsiderate,

185
00:07:06,542 --> 00:07:09,698
classless hick gets here first,

186
00:07:09,698 --> 00:07:11,028
regardless of how long the people

187
00:07:11,028 --> 00:07:14,286
have been waiting in the other line?

188
00:07:14,286 --> 00:07:15,727
- Blow me.

189
00:07:15,727 --> 00:07:17,144
- Ooh, a scholar.

190
00:07:18,246 --> 00:07:19,335
I'm sorry.

191
00:07:19,335 --> 00:07:21,394
I didn't realize your
rudeness was a direct result

192
00:07:21,394 --> 00:07:25,977
of you wanting to run home
and hit the books, Einstein.

193
00:07:27,950 --> 00:07:28,783
What?

194
00:07:41,424 --> 00:07:43,257
Ah, you don't approve?

195
00:07:44,098 --> 00:07:45,849
- It's not my place to say.

196
00:07:45,849 --> 00:07:47,705
- No, but it is your place to look at me

197
00:07:47,705 --> 00:07:50,556
like a pedophilic leprous
ex-postal worker with bad hair

198
00:07:50,556 --> 00:07:52,260
for wanting to buy it.

199
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:53,911
Go ahead, tell me you don't approve.

200
00:07:53,911 --> 00:07:55,250
I can handle it.

201
00:07:55,250 --> 00:07:56,083
- I just don't know what men like you

202
00:07:56,083 --> 00:07:58,257
get out of smut like this.

203
00:07:58,257 --> 00:07:59,322
- Well, I wish I could tell you

204
00:07:59,322 --> 00:08:00,589
I was buying it for the articles,

205
00:08:00,589 --> 00:08:02,548
but the truth is, I'm gonna go home

206
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:05,715
and jerk myself into a state of bliss.

207
00:08:06,737 --> 00:08:09,500
You wouldn't happen to have any

208
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:13,750
petroleum jelly, or baby
oil, or Pledge, would you?

209
00:08:16,804 --> 00:08:19,471
So, what time are you done here?

210
00:08:26,822 --> 00:08:27,746
No message?

211
00:08:27,746 --> 00:08:29,274
- Nothing.

212
00:08:29,274 --> 00:08:30,935
- Don't tell me you're surprised.

213
00:08:30,935 --> 00:08:32,035
- I don't even know if I can put a name

214
00:08:32,035 --> 00:08:34,983
on what I'm feeling right now.

215
00:08:34,983 --> 00:08:37,394
- I ran into your mom yesterday.

216
00:08:37,394 --> 00:08:38,494
- Oh yeah.

217
00:08:38,494 --> 00:08:40,615
- I don't think she recognized me though.

218
00:08:40,615 --> 00:08:42,354
- It's probably the curse
of substandard looks

219
00:08:42,354 --> 00:08:44,422
and a fledgling personality.

220
00:08:44,422 --> 00:08:45,972
- Good point.

221
00:08:45,972 --> 00:08:47,928
So how's your dad?

222
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,262
- Hmm?

223
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,472
- How's your dad doing?

224
00:08:51,472 --> 00:08:53,771
- I don't know, I haven't
seen him much lately.

225
00:08:53,771 --> 00:08:54,618
- You know, I was thinking yesterday

226
00:08:54,618 --> 00:08:58,646
of that time we missed the
bus and he drove us to school.

227
00:08:58,646 --> 00:08:59,878
- When was this?

228
00:08:59,878 --> 00:09:02,920
- Come on, remember junior high school.

229
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:06,135
He was driving us to
school, and he let us skip.

230
00:09:06,135 --> 00:09:07,918
And I thought that was
so cool at the time.

231
00:09:07,918 --> 00:09:10,634
My father would've never done that.

232
00:09:10,634 --> 00:09:11,998
- Why don't I remember this?

233
00:09:11,998 --> 00:09:14,231
- Because you're an idiot.

234
00:09:14,231 --> 00:09:16,772
Come on, he said that he would
take us to the arcade first,

235
00:09:16,772 --> 00:09:18,730
but then we had to go to the museum.

236
00:09:18,730 --> 00:09:21,106
Certainly a fair trade-off
instead of school.

237
00:09:21,106 --> 00:09:23,262
- Okay, I remember.

238
00:09:23,262 --> 00:09:26,715
- That was the first time I
enjoyed anything cultural.

239
00:09:26,715 --> 00:09:28,619
- Oh come on, you liked the nudes.

240
00:09:28,619 --> 00:09:29,930
And that Dwayne Hanson sculpture

241
00:09:29,930 --> 00:09:33,097
we thought was a real guy for
the first hour we were there.

242
00:09:33,097 --> 00:09:36,111
- I remember, I remember that painting.

243
00:09:36,111 --> 00:09:37,528
Was it a Chagall?

244
00:09:39,097 --> 00:09:41,439
Remember, your father asked
us what we thought of it.

245
00:09:41,439 --> 00:09:43,801
And you said the painter
used too much blue.

246
00:09:43,801 --> 00:09:45,436
You remember that?

247
00:09:45,436 --> 00:09:46,444
- Barely.

248
00:09:46,444 --> 00:09:48,508
- See that's the part
that I remember the most.

249
00:09:48,508 --> 00:09:50,147
Your dad said that you needed to look past

250
00:09:50,147 --> 00:09:51,057
what you didn't like,

251
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:53,651
to see if there was something
else there that you did,

252
00:09:53,651 --> 00:09:56,257
that may be there's something
else you could get out of it.

253
00:09:56,257 --> 00:09:59,245
You know, he said that if you
could see past that one flaw,

254
00:09:59,245 --> 00:10:01,178
you know that one thing you
couldn't stand about it,

255
00:10:01,178 --> 00:10:04,647
that maybe there was
something special beneath,

256
00:10:04,647 --> 00:10:07,730
you know, something you were missing.

257
00:10:09,461 --> 00:10:10,674
I didn't think you got it at the time,

258
00:10:10,674 --> 00:10:12,870
but I realized he wasn't just talking

259
00:10:12,870 --> 00:10:15,203
about the painting, was he?

260
00:10:16,038 --> 00:10:18,080
- Where is all this coming from?

261
00:10:18,080 --> 00:10:20,694
- I don't know, I just asked
how your dad was doing.

262
00:10:20,694 --> 00:10:24,284
You didn't know, so I guess
he's the same as always.

263
00:10:24,284 --> 00:10:25,248
(phone ringing)

264
00:10:25,248 --> 00:10:26,081
Hang on.

265
00:10:29,158 --> 00:10:29,991
Hello?

266
00:10:31,606 --> 00:10:33,189
Hey, how you doing?

267
00:10:34,620 --> 00:10:36,787
I'm enlightening a friend.

268
00:10:39,132 --> 00:10:40,049
Sure, when?

269
00:10:42,675 --> 00:10:44,499
Make it an hour.

270
00:10:44,499 --> 00:10:46,617
Okay, cool, awesome.

271
00:10:46,617 --> 00:10:48,034
This babe is hot.

272
00:10:49,094 --> 00:10:50,691
Here you go.

273
00:10:50,691 --> 00:10:51,901
- What's this?

274
00:10:51,901 --> 00:10:54,782
A good-looking guy like you
shouldn't go home alone.

275
00:10:54,782 --> 00:10:55,782
See ya stud.

276
00:11:05,331 --> 00:11:06,164
- Hi.

277
00:11:08,714 --> 00:11:10,260
- Hi.

278
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:13,677
- Mom said there were some packages here?

279
00:11:16,995 --> 00:11:18,162
Are they here?

280
00:11:21,254 --> 00:11:23,004
- Yeah, they're here.

281
00:11:24,304 --> 00:11:25,304
Like always.

282
00:11:28,471 --> 00:11:30,464
- You know, you could just
tell me where they are.

283
00:11:30,464 --> 00:11:31,341
- What I'd like to know is,

284
00:11:31,341 --> 00:11:33,402
why you don't have these
things shipped to the office,

285
00:11:33,402 --> 00:11:35,005
or even your place?

286
00:11:35,005 --> 00:11:35,896
- Well, I'm not home during the day,

287
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:37,659
and a lot of times there's
nobody at the office.

288
00:11:37,659 --> 00:11:38,811
I told you that before.

289
00:11:38,811 --> 00:11:40,656
- And I told you before that
I got better things to do

290
00:11:40,656 --> 00:11:42,770
than to play your secretary twice a week.

291
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:43,960
I get pulled away from what I'm doing

292
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:45,437
to deal with your shit.

293
00:11:45,437 --> 00:11:47,598
- Oh well, I didn't realize
this was such a big deal.

294
00:11:47,598 --> 00:11:48,846
You guys said you wouldn't mind.

295
00:11:48,846 --> 00:11:51,128
- No, your mother said she wouldn't mind.

296
00:11:51,128 --> 00:11:52,485
You never asked me.

297
00:11:52,485 --> 00:11:53,624
And it isn't a big deal,

298
00:11:53,624 --> 00:11:55,420
but it is an annoyance.

299
00:11:55,420 --> 00:11:57,003
You know, for as well as
you claim to be doing,

300
00:11:57,003 --> 00:11:58,683
I'm just amazed that
you can't afford someone

301
00:11:58,683 --> 00:11:59,621
to answer the phone

302
00:11:59,621 --> 00:12:01,362
and sign for your little packages,

303
00:12:01,362 --> 00:12:03,679
instead of putting your
parents out with it.

304
00:12:03,679 --> 00:12:05,995
- I have a cell phone and
a machine at the office.

305
00:12:05,995 --> 00:12:07,471
What do you think, I
should spend $500 a week

306
00:12:07,471 --> 00:12:09,077
to have somebody to do 10 minutes of work

307
00:12:09,077 --> 00:12:10,087
signing for packages?

308
00:12:10,087 --> 00:12:12,286
- No, not when your mother
and I will do it for free.

309
00:12:12,286 --> 00:12:13,892
Why would you?

310
00:12:13,892 --> 00:12:16,181
- Fine. Look mom said she wouldn't mind,

311
00:12:16,181 --> 00:12:17,717
so I'll just have to hope she's around.

312
00:12:17,717 --> 00:12:19,473
If not, you can refuse my packages,

313
00:12:19,473 --> 00:12:20,306
and if you're real lucky

314
00:12:20,306 --> 00:12:22,373
you can ruin my business in the process.

315
00:12:22,373 --> 00:12:23,206
- Come on, Rob.

316
00:12:23,206 --> 00:12:24,583
Don't try to make me the bad guy here.

317
00:12:24,583 --> 00:12:28,416
I never promised this
shit in the first place.

318
00:12:41,962 --> 00:12:42,936
- They're here.

319
00:12:42,936 --> 00:12:44,436
- Yep, they showed up last night.

320
00:12:44,436 --> 00:12:45,726
- How many?

321
00:12:45,726 --> 00:12:47,143
- 16, four boxes.

322
00:12:48,498 --> 00:12:49,331
- Did you try one?

323
00:12:49,331 --> 00:12:50,286
- Yeah, we had both of mine,

324
00:12:50,286 --> 00:12:52,999
they were part of last
night's festivities.

325
00:12:52,999 --> 00:12:53,836
- How are they?

326
00:12:53,836 --> 00:12:54,669
- They're unbelievable.

327
00:12:54,669 --> 00:12:56,272
I mean, if these things clear the FDA,

328
00:12:56,272 --> 00:12:57,262
we will cap for sure.

329
00:12:57,262 --> 00:12:59,599
They're gonna have to go with ours.

330
00:12:59,599 --> 00:13:03,070
- So is that the aspiring porn star?

331
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:03,986
- No, not even close.

332
00:13:03,986 --> 00:13:04,986
She's a nun.

333
00:13:05,936 --> 00:13:07,071
- Yeah, right.

334
00:13:07,071 --> 00:13:07,904
- No, I'm serious.

335
00:13:07,904 --> 00:13:08,749
She was gonna be a nun.

336
00:13:08,749 --> 00:13:09,720
- Get outta here.

337
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:12,070
- No, I'm telling you, she didn't make it.

338
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,320
- How do you not make it?

339
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:14,386
Low SATs?

340
00:13:14,386 --> 00:13:16,371
I mean, it can't be the underwear thing.

341
00:13:16,371 --> 00:13:17,984
- She just lost her faith.

342
00:13:17,984 --> 00:13:19,447
I'll tell you this though, last night,

343
00:13:19,447 --> 00:13:21,055
I had her on her knees thanking God.

344
00:13:21,055 --> 00:13:21,888
You wanna sea the rug burn?

345
00:13:21,888 --> 00:13:23,321
- Maybe later.

346
00:13:23,321 --> 00:13:25,406
- So what'd you do last night?

347
00:13:25,406 --> 00:13:27,697
- You know, nothing big.

348
00:13:27,697 --> 00:13:28,969
You didn't go to the airport, did you?

349
00:13:28,969 --> 00:13:29,886
- What? No.

350
00:13:30,994 --> 00:13:32,827
- You did, didn't you?

351
00:13:34,234 --> 00:13:35,067
- Hi.

352
00:13:35,067 --> 00:13:36,021
- Hey.

353
00:13:36,021 --> 00:13:37,744
- I'm gonna grab a smoothie,
do you want anything?

354
00:13:37,744 --> 00:13:40,071
- Yeah, why don't you grab,

355
00:13:40,071 --> 00:13:42,434
would you grab some chocolate
syrup, some cherries,

356
00:13:42,434 --> 00:13:45,044
and some more paper towels?

357
00:13:45,044 --> 00:13:47,394
Hey, do we have any ice left?

358
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:49,494
- No, I'm pretty sure we used it all.

359
00:13:49,494 --> 00:13:50,642
- Do you think we should get some more?

360
00:13:50,642 --> 00:13:53,421
- Definitely.
- All right.

361
00:13:53,421 --> 00:13:55,244
- What do you do to these girls?

362
00:13:55,244 --> 00:13:56,084
- Girls?

363
00:13:56,084 --> 00:13:58,321
She's 19, and don't try
and skirt the issue.

364
00:13:58,321 --> 00:13:59,744
You were at the airport again last night,

365
00:13:59,744 --> 00:14:00,692
looking for her.

366
00:14:00,692 --> 00:14:03,106
- So I stopped by for
a few minutes, so what?

367
00:14:03,106 --> 00:14:03,939
- So what?

368
00:14:03,939 --> 00:14:04,907
It's been over a week, Rob.

369
00:14:04,907 --> 00:14:06,194
She's obviously not looking for you.

370
00:14:06,194 --> 00:14:07,471
- I want to find her.

371
00:14:07,471 --> 00:14:08,757
- What are you gonna do?

372
00:14:08,757 --> 00:14:10,244
Are you gonna hire a detective?

373
00:14:10,244 --> 00:14:12,344
Or are you gonna hack the passenger list

374
00:14:12,344 --> 00:14:14,321
and find out what flight she was on?

375
00:14:14,321 --> 00:14:15,957
- I tried that.

376
00:14:15,957 --> 00:14:17,280
- You did not.

377
00:14:17,280 --> 00:14:19,144
- Well, actually I gave
the ticket agent 200 bucks

378
00:14:19,144 --> 00:14:21,307
to get me a print out of
the manifest of the flight.

379
00:14:21,307 --> 00:14:22,194
She wouldn't do it.

380
00:14:22,194 --> 00:14:23,631
- I would hope not.

381
00:14:23,631 --> 00:14:25,444
Man, you're losing it, my friend.

382
00:14:25,444 --> 00:14:26,807
Let me wake you up a
little bit here, all right?

383
00:14:26,807 --> 00:14:29,691
In fairy tales, the hopeless
romantic gets the girl.

384
00:14:29,691 --> 00:14:33,091
In real life, they get
arrested for stalking.

385
00:14:33,091 --> 00:14:34,714
- You just don't understand.

386
00:14:34,714 --> 00:14:36,927
- You're obviously worked
up about this girl.

387
00:14:36,927 --> 00:14:38,294
You need to relax.

388
00:14:38,294 --> 00:14:39,907
What are you doing tonight?

389
00:14:39,907 --> 00:14:40,740
- Why?

390
00:14:42,329 --> 00:14:47,238
(rock music)

391
00:15:02,594 --> 00:15:04,720
- I saw this guy strip out of a suit once.

392
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:06,553
Oh my God, it was hot.

393
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:10,757
- This is turning into an
expensive evening for you.

394
00:15:10,757 --> 00:15:13,657
- Are you telling me that
ass isn't worth a dollar?

395
00:15:13,657 --> 00:15:17,270
Wait, don't answer that
until he takes his pants off.

396
00:15:17,270 --> 00:15:18,770
- Ooh, can't wait.

397
00:15:19,741 --> 00:15:22,741
- Hey, shake it over this way, stud.

398
00:15:29,220 --> 00:15:30,793
Why are you not having fun?

399
00:15:30,793 --> 00:15:32,384
- I am, but unlike you

400
00:15:32,384 --> 00:15:35,457
it's just not the night of
my seedy over-sexed life.

401
00:15:35,457 --> 00:15:37,493
- My life isn't seedy.

402
00:15:37,493 --> 00:15:38,326
(gasping)

403
00:15:38,326 --> 00:15:40,044
It's that mad bomber, isn't it?

404
00:15:40,044 --> 00:15:40,877
- What?

405
00:15:40,877 --> 00:15:43,644
- You got a thing for that
sexy terrorist, don't you?

406
00:15:43,644 --> 00:15:45,657
- I don't have a thing for anyone.

407
00:15:45,657 --> 00:15:46,620
- Uh huh.

408
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:48,044
Sure.

409
00:15:48,044 --> 00:15:50,961
Hey, bring it right here, big boy.

410
00:15:53,097 --> 00:15:55,720
- [DJ] Okay ladies, grab your pencils,

411
00:15:55,720 --> 00:15:59,580
it's time for contestant number three.

412
00:15:59,580 --> 00:16:01,997

421
00:16:56,613 --> 00:16:58,530
How'd it go last night?

422
00:16:59,364 --> 00:17:00,531
- I was great.

423
00:17:01,414 --> 00:17:03,390
You should have been there.

424
00:17:03,390 --> 00:17:04,973
- I'll get over it.

425
00:17:06,714 --> 00:17:08,677
- Your girl was there.

426
00:17:08,677 --> 00:17:09,850
- What?

427
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:12,377
- The airport babe, Lonnie.

428
00:17:12,377 --> 00:17:14,314
- Leslie, she was there?

429
00:17:14,314 --> 00:17:15,147
- She was.

430
00:17:16,614 --> 00:17:17,700
- Did you talk to her about me,

431
00:17:17,700 --> 00:17:18,940
tell her I was looking for her?

432
00:17:18,940 --> 00:17:20,440
- No, actually I didn't get a chance to.

433
00:17:20,440 --> 00:17:22,912
By the time I had come
back, she was already gone.

434
00:17:22,912 --> 00:17:25,398
- Did you get a license plate, anything?

435
00:17:25,398 --> 00:17:26,231
- Uh, no.

436
00:17:27,450 --> 00:17:29,190
- Which club was this?

437
00:17:29,190 --> 00:17:32,914
- Oh no, there is no way
I'm going to be dragging you

438
00:17:32,914 --> 00:17:35,077
out of a male strip
club every other night.

439
00:17:35,077 --> 00:17:37,690
I mean the airport is bad enough.

440
00:17:37,690 --> 00:17:38,800
And besides, I really don't think

441
00:17:38,800 --> 00:17:40,727
you'd catch her there again anyway.

442
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:44,437
She didn't exactly seem
to be having a good time.

443
00:17:44,437 --> 00:17:48,049
- I just wish you would've been
able to talk to her for me.

444
00:17:48,049 --> 00:17:50,027
- I don't know what good
that would have done.

445
00:17:50,027 --> 00:17:52,137
What was I gonna say?

446
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:55,464
Hi, I'm the the half-naked best friend

447
00:17:55,464 --> 00:17:58,387
of the airport terrorist
you met two weeks ago.

448
00:17:58,387 --> 00:18:01,286
His visitation rights are
coming up in a couple of weeks,

449
00:18:01,286 --> 00:18:05,036
and he'd really love you to stop by.

450
00:18:05,036 --> 00:18:07,210
- I should've been there.

451
00:18:07,210 --> 00:18:09,386
- Well look, next time I'm there,

452
00:18:09,386 --> 00:18:12,110
If I see her, I'll let you know.

453
00:18:12,110 --> 00:18:15,136
But I really wouldn't get your hopes up.

454
00:18:15,136 --> 00:18:16,686
- You're going back?

455
00:18:16,686 --> 00:18:19,936
- Yes I am, two weeks, semi-finals baby.

456
00:18:21,510 --> 00:18:25,677
Hey, I'm shopping here,
come on I'm shopping here.

457
00:18:27,487 --> 00:18:29,560
So listen, did you get the
note I left you on the Baron?

458
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,085
- No.

459
00:18:31,085 --> 00:18:35,050
- Well, we found out that
he's a resident of Portugal.

460
00:18:35,050 --> 00:18:37,573
- Isn't it a bit late to be
getting this information?

461
00:18:37,573 --> 00:18:40,182
- I know, but I just found out.

462
00:18:40,182 --> 00:18:41,969
- Was he born there?

463
00:18:41,969 --> 00:18:42,933
- I don't know yet.

464
00:18:42,933 --> 00:18:44,034
We're looking into it.

465
00:18:44,034 --> 00:18:46,796
- Oh my God, why is everything
going wrong at once?

466
00:18:46,796 --> 00:18:48,546
- Look, let's not get uptight right now.

467
00:18:48,546 --> 00:18:50,984
I mean, if he wasn't born
there, nothing changes.

468
00:18:50,984 --> 00:18:51,817
- Yeah, but if he was,

469
00:18:51,817 --> 00:18:54,446
we need a new runner that
sets us back what, six months?

470
00:18:54,446 --> 00:18:57,160
- Look, let's just wait 'til
we get word back on him.

471
00:18:57,160 --> 00:18:58,360
- Did you try calling him?

472
00:18:58,360 --> 00:18:59,434
- Yes, I did.

473
00:18:59,434 --> 00:19:00,647
His maid said that he was out

474
00:19:00,647 --> 00:19:03,222
at the Salisbury Plains
with some psychics.

475
00:19:03,222 --> 00:19:07,060
I don't know, checking astral
projections around Stonehenge.

476
00:19:07,060 --> 00:19:08,210
What?

477
00:19:08,210 --> 00:19:09,850
- How do we get mixed
up with these people?

478
00:19:09,850 --> 00:19:10,800
- I don't know.

479
00:19:10,800 --> 00:19:11,633
- All right, well let me know

480
00:19:11,633 --> 00:19:13,037
as soon as you hear anything on that.

481
00:19:13,037 --> 00:19:14,573
- Yeah.

482
00:19:14,573 --> 00:19:17,787
- Did you go out with that
stripper the other night?

483
00:19:17,787 --> 00:19:20,487
- Please, exotic dancer.

484
00:19:20,487 --> 00:19:21,973
- Well, whatever.

485
00:19:21,973 --> 00:19:23,524
How'd it go?

486
00:19:23,524 --> 00:19:25,997
- Well, if there was a place
where we can condemed idiots,

487
00:19:25,997 --> 00:19:28,184
she'd have her own kingdom.

488
00:19:28,184 --> 00:19:29,497
- So did you sleep with her?

489
00:19:29,497 --> 00:19:30,947
- Well, yeah.

490
00:19:30,947 --> 00:19:32,960
I mean, what else am I gonna do?

491
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:34,384
You know, it's-

492
00:19:34,384 --> 00:19:35,717
- [Abusive Father] Knock it off.

493
00:19:39,381 --> 00:19:42,631
- I mean, it's not like, you know,

494
00:19:42,631 --> 00:19:45,055
polysyllabic conversation was out,

495
00:19:45,055 --> 00:19:48,138
and it's not like we shared views on,

496
00:19:49,593 --> 00:19:51,281
actually she had no views.

497
00:19:51,281 --> 00:19:53,571
- What do you possibly see in these women?

498
00:19:53,571 --> 00:19:54,621
- Debauchery.

499
00:19:54,621 --> 00:19:57,358
I mean, I'm afraid that's
all there is my friend.

500
00:19:57,358 --> 00:20:01,056
You see Rob, the Leslie's
of this world do not exist.

501
00:20:01,056 --> 00:20:05,358
Nah, listen, she may be
smart, beautiful, and caring.

502
00:20:05,358 --> 00:20:07,005
But if you got to know her,

503
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:10,031
I bet you she has any number
of major personality flaws,

504
00:20:10,031 --> 00:20:12,898
which seriously offset those gifts.

505
00:20:12,898 --> 00:20:15,348
Now, if you're lucky, maybe,

506
00:20:15,348 --> 00:20:17,348
maybe she only has a fear of commitment,

507
00:20:17,348 --> 00:20:20,835
or any physical contact
beyond the handshake.

508
00:20:20,835 --> 00:20:24,358
Maybe she likes guys who
chew with their mouths open.

509
00:20:24,358 --> 00:20:27,682
Gets turned on by the smell of Ajax.

510
00:20:27,682 --> 00:20:28,921
Best case scenario,

511
00:20:28,921 --> 00:20:32,135
you spend a lifetime trying
to straighten her out,

512
00:20:32,135 --> 00:20:33,748
which you never do,

513
00:20:33,748 --> 00:20:35,358
but you keep yourself so busy

514
00:20:35,358 --> 00:20:36,571
with the delusions of improvement

515
00:20:36,571 --> 00:20:38,257
that you never realized the lost cause

516
00:20:38,257 --> 00:20:40,285
you took on in the first place.

517
00:20:40,285 --> 00:20:41,952
Worst case scenario,

518
00:20:43,321 --> 00:20:45,871
worst case scenario, she ends up

519
00:20:45,871 --> 00:20:48,221
killing you, or herself,

520
00:20:48,221 --> 00:20:51,121
or taking out a restaurant full of people

521
00:20:51,121 --> 00:20:54,995
with a street legal automatic
weapon of your choice.

522
00:20:54,995 --> 00:20:57,721
I mean worse yet, even
that, listen to this.

523
00:20:57,721 --> 00:20:59,757
One night, right, after dinner,

524
00:20:59,757 --> 00:21:01,635
during the course of, you know,

525
00:21:01,635 --> 00:21:03,235
just casual conversation,

526
00:21:03,235 --> 00:21:05,045
she leans over and says,

527
00:21:05,045 --> 00:21:07,295
hey, maybe O.J. didn't do it.

528
00:21:09,283 --> 00:21:14,085
I mean, I'm not gonna
subject myself to such grief.

529
00:21:14,085 --> 00:21:16,398
I mean, the reason that I get
along with a woman so well,

530
00:21:16,398 --> 00:21:19,185
is that before I finish
saying a word to her,

531
00:21:19,185 --> 00:21:20,418
I have resigned myself to the fact

532
00:21:20,418 --> 00:21:22,881
that she is gonna be a complete flake.

533
00:21:22,881 --> 00:21:25,544
I won't be able to put up with
her for more than a month.

534
00:21:25,544 --> 00:21:27,044
- [Rob] You know, it's kind
of sad that a guy your age

535
00:21:27,044 --> 00:21:28,594
has already given up.

536
00:21:28,594 --> 00:21:29,819
- Given up?

537
00:21:29,819 --> 00:21:30,831
I've never wasted the energy

538
00:21:30,831 --> 00:21:33,931
in deluding myself in the first place.

539
00:21:33,931 --> 00:21:35,871
I mean, I'm actually,

540
00:21:35,871 --> 00:21:39,371
I'm actually amazed that a
guy as intelligent as yourself

541
00:21:39,371 --> 00:21:42,494
buys into a, I mean granted romantic,

542
00:21:42,494 --> 00:21:46,161
but foolishly unattainable
popular ideology.

543
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:51,141
- [Abusive Father] Knock that shit off!

544
00:21:52,025 --> 00:21:52,858
- Rob?

545
00:22:08,409 --> 00:22:10,076
- Hey, are you okay?

546
00:22:10,911 --> 00:22:12,111
You sure?

547
00:22:12,111 --> 00:22:13,611
It's over. What's your name?

548
00:22:17,848 --> 00:22:18,998
- Hey, I want to press charges.

549
00:22:18,998 --> 00:22:20,035
This guy attacked me.

550
00:22:20,035 --> 00:22:20,975
I want him arrested.

551
00:22:20,975 --> 00:22:22,435
I want him arrested now.

552
00:22:22,435 --> 00:22:23,325
- Hold on.

553
00:22:23,325 --> 00:22:24,648
I want to know what happened.

554
00:22:24,648 --> 00:22:27,046
- Like I told you, he just
started beating on me.

555
00:22:27,046 --> 00:22:29,048
- That's not entirely true, is it?

556
00:22:29,048 --> 00:22:30,582
- Well, you keep this psycho away from me?

557
00:22:30,582 --> 00:22:31,682
I want him thrown in jail.

558
00:22:31,682 --> 00:22:32,515
- You're the one that should be locked up,

559
00:22:32,515 --> 00:22:33,585
you piece of shit.

560
00:22:33,585 --> 00:22:35,007
- Hold on.

561
00:22:35,007 --> 00:22:36,434
What happened?

562
00:22:36,434 --> 00:22:37,457
- [Manager] I didn't see anything.

563
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:39,457
It was over by the time I got here.

564
00:22:39,457 --> 00:22:40,821
- What happened?

565
00:22:40,821 --> 00:22:41,654
- Huh?

566
00:22:41,654 --> 00:22:43,644
- [Cop] What'd you see?

567
00:22:43,644 --> 00:22:45,320
- I was reading this.

568
00:22:45,320 --> 00:22:47,394
- [Cop] You didn't see anything?

569
00:22:47,394 --> 00:22:50,530
- Well, if I saw anything, I
saw this piece of shit here

570
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:51,830
hit this little boy so hard

571
00:22:51,830 --> 00:22:53,330
that it knocked him to the ground.

572
00:22:53,330 --> 00:22:55,067
Then I saw my friend do
what I would have done

573
00:22:55,067 --> 00:22:58,317
if I had the guts, and a loaf of bread.

574
00:23:00,167 --> 00:23:01,407
- Do I know you?

575
00:23:01,407 --> 00:23:02,557
- Yes, sir.

576
00:23:02,557 --> 00:23:03,390
- That's right.

577
00:23:03,390 --> 00:23:05,407
You're the guy with the
bomb from the airport.

578
00:23:05,407 --> 00:23:06,857
- Hey, I said I wanted to press charges-

579
00:23:06,857 --> 00:23:08,524
- Wait, right there.

580
00:23:12,344 --> 00:23:13,257
He hit the kid?

581
00:23:13,257 --> 00:23:14,207
- That's right.

582
00:23:14,207 --> 00:23:15,080
- Hard?

583
00:23:15,080 --> 00:23:16,880
- Hard enough to knock him to the ground.

584
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:19,267
We saw him mistreating him earlier, too.

585
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:20,929
- Did you punch him or slap him?

586
00:23:20,929 --> 00:23:24,179
- Neither, I was hitting him with that.

587
00:23:27,430 --> 00:23:29,430
- You beat on him with a loaf of bread?

588
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:30,263
- Yeah.

589
00:23:30,263 --> 00:23:31,417
- How many times?

590
00:23:31,417 --> 00:23:35,117
- I dunno, a dozen maybe, it broke.

591
00:23:35,117 --> 00:23:36,307
- I see.

592
00:23:36,307 --> 00:23:39,307
Wait here, let me see what I can do.

593
00:23:41,444 --> 00:23:43,430
- Now I want you to tell me what happened.

594
00:23:43,430 --> 00:23:44,334
- I didn't say anything to the guy,

595
00:23:44,334 --> 00:23:47,034
and he starts whacking me with that.

596
00:23:47,034 --> 00:23:49,068
- You look okay now, do
you need an ambulance?

597
00:23:49,068 --> 00:23:52,220
- No, but I want to press charges.

598
00:23:52,220 --> 00:23:53,384
- Is that your son?

599
00:23:53,384 --> 00:23:54,734
- Yeah, that's my boy.

600
00:23:54,734 --> 00:23:56,084
My wife's kid.

601
00:23:56,084 --> 00:23:57,294
- Did you hit him?

602
00:23:57,294 --> 00:23:58,656
- No, he wasn't listening to me.

603
00:23:58,656 --> 00:24:01,184
I patted him, but it's
not like I beat him.

604
00:24:01,184 --> 00:24:03,055
- Did you knock him to the ground?

605
00:24:03,055 --> 00:24:06,420
- No, he was trying to
get away and he tripped.

606
00:24:06,420 --> 00:24:08,707
- Okay, I'm gonna need you
to turn around for me sir,

607
00:24:08,707 --> 00:24:09,634
and put your hands behind your head.

608
00:24:09,634 --> 00:24:10,897
- What, what are you talking about?

609
00:24:10,897 --> 00:24:11,730
- I don't believe you,

610
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:12,834
and I'm taking you in on child abuse.

611
00:24:12,834 --> 00:24:14,219
- Well, that's bullshit.

612
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:18,547
- Turn around for me and put
your hands behind your head.

613
00:24:18,547 --> 00:24:20,157
- I didn't do anything.

614
00:24:20,157 --> 00:24:21,334
What about him?

615
00:24:21,334 --> 00:24:23,134
- He's gonna walk out of here
and you're going to jail,

616
00:24:23,134 --> 00:24:24,097
and if I had to ask you again,

617
00:24:24,097 --> 00:24:25,507
to turn around and do as I say

618
00:24:25,507 --> 00:24:26,970
we'll call that resisting arrest.

619
00:24:26,970 --> 00:24:29,330
How do you want to do this?

620
00:24:29,330 --> 00:24:31,163
Don't push me on this.

621
00:24:39,317 --> 00:24:40,282
- Listen, do you want to talk

622
00:24:40,282 --> 00:24:42,130
about what just happened in there?

623
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:42,980
- What's there to talk about?

624
00:24:42,980 --> 00:24:44,540
You were in there, you saw it.

625
00:24:44,540 --> 00:24:46,578
- Let me tell you what I saw, okay?

626
00:24:46,578 --> 00:24:48,024
- I saw the two of us watch a guy

627
00:24:48,024 --> 00:24:49,740
get a little rough with his kid.

628
00:24:49,740 --> 00:24:51,214
Then I see you backtrack to pick

629
00:24:51,214 --> 00:24:52,627
up a monstrous loaf of bread,

630
00:24:52,627 --> 00:24:53,460
I mean, to the likes of which

631
00:24:53,460 --> 00:24:55,522
I've never seen you buy before.

632
00:24:55,522 --> 00:24:57,935
After that, we happen
to be in the same aisle

633
00:24:57,935 --> 00:24:59,087
with the guy and his kid,

634
00:24:59,087 --> 00:25:00,550
until the father does
what either one of us

635
00:25:00,550 --> 00:25:02,400
would have expected him to do.

636
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:04,572
Then you did what I think
you were planning to do

637
00:25:04,572 --> 00:25:07,910
from the moment you saw him
rough up the little boy.

638
00:25:07,910 --> 00:25:09,064
- That's quite a theory,
but you forgot to mention

639
00:25:09,064 --> 00:25:12,513
the guy with the other loaf
of bread on the grassy knoll.

640
00:25:12,513 --> 00:25:13,789
- Let me go one further.

641
00:25:13,789 --> 00:25:15,652
I think that that lashing out in there,

642
00:25:15,652 --> 00:25:18,052
is just another example of
your unstable temperament.

643
00:25:18,052 --> 00:25:19,476
- Oh, unstable temperament?

644
00:25:19,476 --> 00:25:20,812
- Yeah, ever since the airport Rob,

645
00:25:20,812 --> 00:25:22,392
you've had a markedly short fuse.

646
00:25:22,392 --> 00:25:23,379
- And?

647
00:25:23,379 --> 00:25:25,016
- And I just think it's time for you

648
00:25:25,016 --> 00:25:26,206
to go see the police chief.

649
00:25:26,206 --> 00:25:27,966
I mean, it's obvious that
your passive approach

650
00:25:27,966 --> 00:25:28,879
is not working.

651
00:25:28,879 --> 00:25:32,366
- It's just seems a little
extreme, almost obsessive,

652
00:25:32,366 --> 00:25:34,029
don't you think?

653
00:25:34,029 --> 00:25:36,192
- You know what, it's like this,

654
00:25:36,192 --> 00:25:37,703
the man who wants to understand the world

655
00:25:37,703 --> 00:25:40,019
needs simply to pick up a book.

656
00:25:40,019 --> 00:25:43,242
A man who wants to rule it, must write it.

657
00:25:43,242 --> 00:25:45,409
So, are you ready to rule?

658
00:25:46,619 --> 00:25:48,506
- You know, I am.

659
00:25:48,506 --> 00:25:49,339
- Good.

660
00:25:52,069 --> 00:25:54,402
(laughing)

661
00:25:55,569 --> 00:25:58,402
- What was it your pink fuzzy ones?

662
00:26:00,736 --> 00:26:01,569
Hey.

663
00:26:02,787 --> 00:26:06,549
Hey, don't we have a
warrant out for this guy?

664
00:26:06,549 --> 00:26:08,816
Assault with a leavened weapon.

665
00:26:08,816 --> 00:26:11,149
(laughing)

666
00:26:12,137 --> 00:26:14,102
You know something?

667
00:26:14,102 --> 00:26:15,739
You're really lucky.

668
00:26:15,739 --> 00:26:17,028
The last guy who was attacked

669
00:26:17,028 --> 00:26:19,016
with a loaf of bread around here,

670
00:26:19,016 --> 00:26:21,089
died of a yeast infection.

671
00:26:21,089 --> 00:26:23,666
(laughing)

672
00:26:23,666 --> 00:26:24,616
- Hey, and it's a good thing

673
00:26:24,616 --> 00:26:25,799
you didn't kill that guy last night.

674
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:29,216
We have to start calling you Bread Bundy.

675
00:26:31,902 --> 00:26:33,876
- No, he was a cereal killer.

676
00:26:33,876 --> 00:26:37,056
At least bread's in the same food group.

677
00:26:37,056 --> 00:26:39,869
(laughing)

678
00:26:39,869 --> 00:26:44,029
Hey look, if you decide
to attack anybody tonight,

679
00:26:44,029 --> 00:26:48,027
would you use a bottle of
mustard and some salami?

680
00:26:48,027 --> 00:26:51,392
That way the guys in the
evidence room can have a picnic.

681
00:26:51,392 --> 00:26:53,725
(laughing)

682
00:26:56,792 --> 00:26:59,206
Well, I know you didn't come down here

683
00:26:59,206 --> 00:27:01,106
just to let us pick on you.

684
00:27:01,106 --> 00:27:02,606
- Well no, actually there is something

685
00:27:02,606 --> 00:27:05,029
you could help me with.

686
00:27:05,029 --> 00:27:06,112
- What is it?

687
00:27:07,542 --> 00:27:10,369
- Do you have a sketch artist?

688
00:27:10,369 --> 00:27:14,036
(light instrumental music)

689
00:27:47,429 --> 00:27:48,805
- Yeah?

690
00:27:48,805 --> 00:27:49,805
- Yeah, what?

691
00:27:51,129 --> 00:27:52,056
- [Burger Flipper] What do you want?

692
00:27:52,056 --> 00:27:53,679
- What do I want?

693
00:27:53,679 --> 00:27:56,355
I'm here to sign up for the
next Dale Carnegie course.

694
00:27:56,355 --> 00:27:57,938
Never heard of him?

695
00:27:58,842 --> 00:28:00,262
There's a shocker.

696
00:28:00,262 --> 00:28:01,456
What do you think I want?

697
00:28:01,456 --> 00:28:02,623
I want to eat.

698
00:28:03,805 --> 00:28:05,292
- I can take your order.

699
00:28:05,292 --> 00:28:08,459
- I'd like the number two with a Coke.

700
00:28:09,355 --> 00:28:12,463
- Let's see, I'll have
two hamburgers, no onions,

701
00:28:12,463 --> 00:28:14,596
a fry and a large Coke.

702
00:28:14,596 --> 00:28:17,519
- You can get the number four,
it's the two burger combo.

703
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:19,405
- You know I don't doubt the number four

704
00:28:19,405 --> 00:28:20,732
is a two burger combo.

705
00:28:20,732 --> 00:28:22,795
I also believe you, when
you tell me I can order it.

706
00:28:22,795 --> 00:28:23,946
However, the number four wouldn't give me

707
00:28:23,946 --> 00:28:26,044
what I just ordered, would it?

708
00:28:26,044 --> 00:28:27,417
- You wouldn't to get a large Coke,

709
00:28:27,417 --> 00:28:29,918
but you can supersize
it for 19 cents more.

710
00:28:29,918 --> 00:28:32,269
- Yes, and if I did that, I
would also get a large fry,

711
00:28:32,269 --> 00:28:34,109
which is not what I wanted to order.

712
00:28:34,109 --> 00:28:36,696
So if you want to sell me the
number four without onions,

713
00:28:36,696 --> 00:28:37,969
and charge me nine and a half cents

714
00:28:37,969 --> 00:28:41,159
to have a large Coke
with that, I'll do it.

715
00:28:41,159 --> 00:28:42,946
- We don't do that.

716
00:28:42,946 --> 00:28:47,029
- Well, that certainly
wasn't easy now was it?

717
00:28:48,819 --> 00:28:50,319
- That'll be 6.72.

718
00:28:53,829 --> 00:28:55,842
- How long could it
take to fry up a burger?

719
00:28:55,842 --> 00:28:57,313
- [Rob] You did order it special.

720
00:28:57,313 --> 00:28:58,242
- Special?

721
00:28:58,242 --> 00:29:00,066
No, I ordered it the way I like it.

722
00:29:00,066 --> 00:29:01,363
I mean, I find pre-prepared food

723
00:29:01,363 --> 00:29:03,116
the bane of the service industry.

724
00:29:03,116 --> 00:29:04,566
And people like you, well you capitulate

725
00:29:04,566 --> 00:29:07,152
and you'll take whatever they
tell you is easiest to get.

726
00:29:07,152 --> 00:29:09,166
I don't give in so easily.

727
00:29:09,166 --> 00:29:11,516
I don't want onions on my burger, period.

728
00:29:11,516 --> 00:29:12,966
I'm not gonna eat onions.

729
00:29:12,966 --> 00:29:15,502
I'm not gonna scrape them
off like some vagrant.

730
00:29:15,502 --> 00:29:18,399
I want my hamburger prepared sans onion.

731
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:20,596
I'm the customer, and I'm always right.

732
00:29:20,596 --> 00:29:22,287
- Then expect to wait.

733
00:29:22,287 --> 00:29:23,885
- [Burger Flipper #2] Here.

734
00:29:23,885 --> 00:29:24,718
- Thank you.

735
00:29:24,718 --> 00:29:25,551
Hang on a sec.

736
00:29:25,551 --> 00:29:27,030
Could you send your
manager over here, please?

737
00:29:27,030 --> 00:29:28,930
- [Burger Flipper #2] Hold on.

738
00:29:28,930 --> 00:29:30,665
- What is this about?

739
00:29:30,665 --> 00:29:32,330
- The service here is abominable.

740
00:29:32,330 --> 00:29:34,327
All right, let me tell you
another little observation

741
00:29:34,327 --> 00:29:37,115
that my keen insights
have made me aware of.

742
00:29:37,115 --> 00:29:39,328
As the service in fast
food restaurants like this

743
00:29:39,328 --> 00:29:41,052
began to deteriorate over the years,

744
00:29:41,052 --> 00:29:43,142
the management started
to notice the business

745
00:29:43,142 --> 00:29:44,542
that was being lost.

746
00:29:44,542 --> 00:29:45,402
Now in particular,

747
00:29:45,402 --> 00:29:48,128
the business that utilizes
the drive-through lane, right?

748
00:29:48,128 --> 00:29:49,239
So over the years,

749
00:29:49,239 --> 00:29:51,265
as the service got more
and more unacceptable,

750
00:29:51,265 --> 00:29:53,439
more and more people would
grow tired of waiting,

751
00:29:53,439 --> 00:29:55,052
and they'd leave the drive-through line.

752
00:29:55,052 --> 00:29:56,239
So now these establishments,

753
00:29:56,239 --> 00:29:58,642
instead of trying to improve the service,

754
00:29:58,642 --> 00:30:01,378
and expedite the orders a
little bit more promptly, no,

755
00:30:01,378 --> 00:30:04,878
they came up with the brilliant
idea of building barricades

756
00:30:04,878 --> 00:30:06,899
on either side of the drive-through line,

757
00:30:06,899 --> 00:30:08,278
to trap those hungry rats

758
00:30:08,278 --> 00:30:10,302
foolish enough to enter that maze.

759
00:30:10,302 --> 00:30:11,969
Well, not me, never.

760
00:30:12,814 --> 00:30:14,602
I mean, no matter how long the wait,

761
00:30:14,602 --> 00:30:17,502
how inept the service,
you're boxed in like cattle.

762
00:30:17,502 --> 00:30:19,865
How pathetic will people
let themselves get?

763
00:30:19,865 --> 00:30:22,275
By the millions people
flock to these places

764
00:30:22,275 --> 00:30:26,015
to pay for these
overpriced, overrated meals,

765
00:30:26,015 --> 00:30:28,778
packaged in a way that's
convenient for the establishment.

766
00:30:28,778 --> 00:30:30,842
And then, then they put
themselves in thrall

767
00:30:30,842 --> 00:30:32,652
of the towering incompetence of service

768
00:30:32,652 --> 00:30:34,928
that is responsible for
shoveling up these feasts,

769
00:30:34,928 --> 00:30:36,642
by pulling into the black hole

770
00:30:36,642 --> 00:30:39,452
known as the drive-through lane.

771
00:30:39,452 --> 00:30:41,739
- Everything is an issue, isn't it?

772
00:30:41,739 --> 00:30:42,789
- Can I help you?

773
00:30:42,789 --> 00:30:44,392
- Yes, I was wondering if as manager

774
00:30:44,392 --> 00:30:46,615
you encourage customer service
in your service business,

775
00:30:46,615 --> 00:30:49,365
which happens to deal with customers?

776
00:30:49,365 --> 00:30:50,978
- Of course, is there a problem?

777
00:30:50,978 --> 00:30:51,811
- Oh yeah.

778
00:30:51,811 --> 00:30:52,802
I was wondering if any of your people

779
00:30:52,802 --> 00:30:54,991
know the first thing about courtesy?

780
00:30:54,991 --> 00:30:56,489
I mean, I'm amazed that throughout

781
00:30:56,489 --> 00:30:58,240
my entire experience here,

782
00:30:58,240 --> 00:30:59,978
I have yet to hear the words, please,

783
00:30:59,978 --> 00:31:01,890
thank you, or you're welcome.

784
00:31:01,890 --> 00:31:05,250
When my food was brought
over, I was told here.

785
00:31:05,250 --> 00:31:08,278
I mean I would have expected,
'Sorry about the wait, sir',

786
00:31:08,278 --> 00:31:10,765
but I can't tell you that
I'm terribly surprised.

787
00:31:10,765 --> 00:31:12,128
I mean, is courtesy just a lost idea

788
00:31:12,128 --> 00:31:14,990
in the fast food branch
of the service industry?

789
00:31:14,990 --> 00:31:15,823
- [Manager] Well, I'm sorry.

790
00:31:15,823 --> 00:31:16,689
- I'm actually inclined to think

791
00:31:16,689 --> 00:31:18,365
that the fast food branch

792
00:31:18,365 --> 00:31:20,992
is no longer under the umbrella
of the service industry.

793
00:31:20,992 --> 00:31:23,252
I mean, at least one
of your guys back there

794
00:31:23,252 --> 00:31:25,078
can hardly speak any English.

795
00:31:25,078 --> 00:31:28,078
Now, that would be fine if
you had him dunking fries,

796
00:31:28,078 --> 00:31:31,092
but no, you've got him
up front taking orders.

797
00:31:31,092 --> 00:31:33,439
I heard him ask a guy four times

798
00:31:33,439 --> 00:31:35,741
if he wanted to buy a cherry pie.

799
00:31:35,741 --> 00:31:36,574
- Okay, you see-

800
00:31:36,574 --> 00:31:37,407
- I thought he was asking the guy

801
00:31:37,407 --> 00:31:40,253
if you wanted to rent a Cherokee.

802
00:31:40,253 --> 00:31:42,051
You should just be thankful, okay,

803
00:31:42,051 --> 00:31:43,540
that he wasn't serving me.

804
00:31:43,540 --> 00:31:45,051
Because if he was, there'd be snipers

805
00:31:45,051 --> 00:31:46,426
on the roof across the street,

806
00:31:46,426 --> 00:31:48,351
waiting for me to reveal myself.

807
00:31:48,351 --> 00:31:50,403
I mean, how bad are you
gonna let things get?

808
00:31:50,403 --> 00:31:52,140
- Okay, I understand you're upset.

809
00:31:52,140 --> 00:31:52,973
I'm sorry.

810
00:31:52,973 --> 00:31:55,890
I just, I don't have time for this.

811
00:31:58,916 --> 00:32:01,703
- That guy does all
the hiring right there.

812
00:32:01,703 --> 00:32:03,166
- Well, at least he said he was sorry.

813
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:03,999
- Yeah, he did.

814
00:32:03,999 --> 00:32:04,964
And if he could have
mustered up enough saliva

815
00:32:04,964 --> 00:32:07,131
he would have spat in my eye.

816
00:32:08,241 --> 00:32:10,678
Anyways, any word on the flyers?

817
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,301
- Not yet, but I put
them all over the place.

818
00:32:12,301 --> 00:32:14,551
It shouldn't be long now.

819
00:32:14,551 --> 00:32:15,384
- Right.

820
00:32:17,289 --> 00:32:20,288
- So, do you think I'll hear from her?

821
00:32:20,288 --> 00:32:22,214
- Or her lawyer.

822
00:32:22,214 --> 00:32:25,797
(soft instrumental music)

823
00:32:35,201 --> 00:32:36,328
- This isn't funny.

824
00:32:36,328 --> 00:32:37,978
- It kind of is actually.

825
00:32:37,978 --> 00:32:40,128
- I spoke to this guy
for maybe 10 minutes.

826
00:32:40,128 --> 00:32:41,712
What is wrong with him?

827
00:32:41,712 --> 00:32:44,676
- You must have made some impression.

828
00:32:44,676 --> 00:32:45,509
Did he?

829
00:32:52,009 --> 00:32:53,799
- I came across a bunch
more of those pictures

830
00:32:53,799 --> 00:32:56,622
you drew when you were
in your flying phase.

831
00:32:56,622 --> 00:32:58,236
- I remember that.

832
00:32:58,236 --> 00:32:59,622
There must be a hundred of those.

833
00:32:59,622 --> 00:33:03,736
- More, this last box has a
couple hundred all by itself.

834
00:33:03,736 --> 00:33:07,536
You were really quite obsessed
with the idea for a while.

835
00:33:07,536 --> 00:33:09,009
- What kid wasn't?

836
00:33:09,009 --> 00:33:09,959
I remember when you sat me down

837
00:33:09,959 --> 00:33:12,197
and told me that some day I could fly.

838
00:33:12,197 --> 00:33:16,099
I could learn to fly a
plane or sail a hang glider.

839
00:33:16,099 --> 00:33:19,160
You even mentioned
skydiving, remember that?

840
00:33:19,160 --> 00:33:20,969
You regretted mentioning
that one right away,

841
00:33:20,969 --> 00:33:23,870
like I'd run out and do
it at nine years old.

842
00:33:23,870 --> 00:33:24,826
- I thought it would make you feel better,

843
00:33:24,826 --> 00:33:27,493
but you just got more depressed.

844
00:33:28,536 --> 00:33:30,874
- I was so sure that if
I wanted it badly enough,

845
00:33:30,874 --> 00:33:33,423
I could learn to fly like Superman.

846
00:33:33,423 --> 00:33:34,923
No nets, no wires,

847
00:33:36,649 --> 00:33:38,649
defy gravity, just soar.

848
00:33:39,962 --> 00:33:41,774
Simply a matter of will.

849
00:33:41,774 --> 00:33:44,786
- [Mom] Whatever happened to that dream?

850
00:33:44,786 --> 00:33:48,189
- Guess I didn't want it badly enough.

851
00:33:48,189 --> 00:33:49,965
- So are are you seeing anyone?

852
00:33:49,965 --> 00:33:52,539
I ran into your little
assistant the other day.

853
00:33:52,539 --> 00:33:54,963
He had a lovely young woman on his arm.

854
00:33:54,963 --> 00:33:57,415
He always does though, doesn't he?

855
00:33:57,415 --> 00:33:58,582
- He seems to.

856
00:33:59,815 --> 00:34:02,232
- [Mom] Well, what about you?

857
00:34:04,025 --> 00:34:07,365
- I met a woman I think I
could get serious about.

858
00:34:07,365 --> 00:34:08,865
- What's she like?

859
00:34:10,102 --> 00:34:11,935
- She sends me flying.

860
00:34:13,302 --> 00:34:15,825
- You blocked the garage.

861
00:34:15,825 --> 00:34:18,452
- Sorry, I was only
gonna be a few minutes.

862
00:34:18,452 --> 00:34:19,285
- Out of respect for me,

863
00:34:19,285 --> 00:34:21,339
could you at least park
at the end of the drive,

864
00:34:21,339 --> 00:34:23,325
so I can get in my own house?

865
00:34:23,325 --> 00:34:25,325
- I didn't think I'd be
here when you get back.

866
00:34:25,325 --> 00:34:26,992
Anyway, I'm leaving.

867
00:34:29,213 --> 00:34:32,796
- Put my car in the
garage on your way out.

868
00:34:34,085 --> 00:34:34,918
- Bye, mom.

869
00:34:34,918 --> 00:34:35,918
- Bye, honey.

870
00:34:38,062 --> 00:34:41,979
(mysterious instrumental music)

871
00:35:07,412 --> 00:35:08,785
- You're gonna call him.

872
00:35:08,785 --> 00:35:09,750
- This is ridiculous.

873
00:35:09,750 --> 00:35:11,052
- I knew you'd call him.

874
00:35:11,052 --> 00:35:12,600
- I'm telling him to stop.

875
00:35:12,600 --> 00:35:13,433
- Uh-huh.

876
00:35:14,622 --> 00:35:15,935
(phone ringing)

877
00:35:15,935 --> 00:35:17,285
- Solutions, Rob here.

878
00:35:17,285 --> 00:35:21,009
- I want you to stop with the flyers.

879
00:35:21,009 --> 00:35:23,022
- Well, sure, of course.

880
00:35:23,022 --> 00:35:24,179
I just wanted to see you again

881
00:35:24,179 --> 00:35:25,782
so I could explain what happened.

882
00:35:25,782 --> 00:35:26,972
- I don't want to see you.

883
00:35:26,972 --> 00:35:27,872
I don't want to talk to you.

884
00:35:27,872 --> 00:35:29,433
I just want to be left alone.

885
00:35:29,433 --> 00:35:32,035
- But at least give me a chance.

886
00:35:32,035 --> 00:35:34,285
- Just stay out of my life.

887
00:35:39,183 --> 00:35:40,435
- I stand corrected.

888
00:35:40,435 --> 00:35:42,085
You are an oak.

889
00:35:42,085 --> 00:35:45,285
Well, if you're lucky, you'll
never hear from him again.

890
00:35:45,285 --> 00:35:46,709
If you're really lucky,

891
00:35:46,709 --> 00:35:50,709
maybe he wasn't as special
as you first thought.

892
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:53,833
- So, what'd she say?

893
00:35:55,033 --> 00:35:57,535
- She wants to be left alone,

894
00:35:57,535 --> 00:36:00,122
wants me to stay out of her life.

895
00:36:00,122 --> 00:36:01,895
- But she called.

896
00:36:01,895 --> 00:36:03,312
- But she called.

897
00:36:10,843 --> 00:36:11,676
- Hi.

898
00:36:12,720 --> 00:36:14,030
Do you have The Count?

899
00:36:14,030 --> 00:36:17,030
- [Clerk] I'm sorry they're all out.

900
00:36:18,540 --> 00:36:22,707
(sentimental instrumental music)

901
00:36:52,502 --> 00:36:54,252
- Flowers for Leslie.

902
00:36:55,829 --> 00:36:58,392
- I told you I wanted to be left alone.

903
00:36:58,392 --> 00:36:59,902
- But these are flowers.

904
00:36:59,902 --> 00:37:02,552
They're soft, beautiful,

905
00:37:02,552 --> 00:37:03,829
smell heavenly.

906
00:37:03,829 --> 00:37:05,952
Everyone likes flowers.

907
00:37:05,952 --> 00:37:07,302
- I like flowers.

908
00:37:07,302 --> 00:37:08,829
It's you I don't know about.

909
00:37:08,829 --> 00:37:10,579
- [Rob] I just want a chance.

910
00:37:10,579 --> 00:37:12,239
- Someone called on the reward.

911
00:37:12,239 --> 00:37:13,852
- One of your customers.

912
00:37:13,852 --> 00:37:16,689
- Tell me, which one of
my ex-customers was it?

913
00:37:16,689 --> 00:37:20,427
- Which one of your preferred customers?

914
00:37:20,427 --> 00:37:22,216
I can't remember.

915
00:37:22,216 --> 00:37:23,883
- Oh, of course not.

916
00:37:31,532 --> 00:37:33,322
- [Rob] So it was nice of your boss

917
00:37:33,322 --> 00:37:35,438
to give you the day off.

918
00:37:35,438 --> 00:37:37,266
- [Leslie] I am the boss.

919
00:37:37,266 --> 00:37:39,179
So why are we here?

920
00:37:39,179 --> 00:37:40,352
- To have fun.

921
00:37:40,352 --> 00:37:43,778
- I know, it's just not a
normal place to take a date.

922
00:37:43,778 --> 00:37:46,168
- Well, actually I brought
you here to impress you.

923
00:37:46,168 --> 00:37:47,553
- Ooh, do you own the place?

924
00:37:47,553 --> 00:37:48,828
- No, but I know what a woman like you

925
00:37:48,828 --> 00:37:50,155
wants more than anything.

926
00:37:50,155 --> 00:37:51,405
- Oh, really?

927
00:37:51,405 --> 00:37:53,005
And what is that?

928
00:37:53,005 --> 00:37:54,505
- Stuffed animals, of course.

929
00:37:56,705 --> 00:37:58,288
We'll go down here.

930
00:37:59,978 --> 00:38:01,367
Wanna do this?

931
00:38:01,367 --> 00:38:02,200
- You want to give it a try?

932
00:38:02,200 --> 00:38:03,033
- Sure.

933
00:38:03,033 --> 00:38:04,616
- Okay, one dollar.

934
00:38:16,403 --> 00:38:19,201
(laughing)

935
00:38:19,201 --> 00:38:21,054
Here you go, here's your prize.

936
00:38:21,054 --> 00:38:25,252
- I don't know, that
looked like luck to me.

937
00:38:25,252 --> 00:38:26,217
- Really? Can I do this again?

938
00:38:26,217 --> 00:38:29,217
- Yeah, yeah, you can win two a day.

939
00:38:39,588 --> 00:38:41,838
(laughing)

940
00:38:43,049 --> 00:38:44,132
- Yes, seat.

941
00:38:47,465 --> 00:38:50,651
- I don't know, I still think
you got lucky on that one.

942
00:38:50,651 --> 00:38:51,484
I'll prove you wrong

943
00:38:51,484 --> 00:38:53,165
when you have a room full of these things.

944
00:38:53,165 --> 00:38:56,123
- You can win two a day, sir.

945
00:38:56,123 --> 00:38:58,488
- Then it looks like
we'll need season passes.

946
00:38:58,488 --> 00:39:00,655
- That sounds like a deal.

947
00:39:05,048 --> 00:39:06,548
God, I love pizza.

948
00:39:08,138 --> 00:39:09,648
- You love pizza?

949
00:39:09,648 --> 00:39:10,481
- Mm-hmm.

950
00:39:12,171 --> 00:39:15,371
- Like the same way you love your family?

951
00:39:15,371 --> 00:39:17,608
- You know what I mean.

952
00:39:17,608 --> 00:39:21,307
- I know, I just hate to
see that word misused.

953
00:39:21,307 --> 00:39:23,158
- You hate it?

954
00:39:23,158 --> 00:39:23,991
- Touché.

955
00:39:26,158 --> 00:39:28,408
- So then what do you love?

956
00:39:30,081 --> 00:39:31,823
- Hmm, I decided a while ago

957
00:39:31,823 --> 00:39:33,443
that I either had to buy into the fact

958
00:39:33,443 --> 00:39:34,946
that the word love is misused,

959
00:39:34,946 --> 00:39:38,696
or be the only one to
say it with conviction.

960
00:39:39,623 --> 00:39:41,507
- And you chose the latter?

961
00:39:41,507 --> 00:39:44,733
- Actually no, I came up with a new word.

962
00:39:44,733 --> 00:39:48,633
It's not as perverted, as artificial.

963
00:39:48,633 --> 00:39:52,257
You know, love can be used
as a noun, verb, slang.

964
00:39:52,257 --> 00:39:55,058
I mean that's the
problem, it's too diverse.

965
00:39:55,058 --> 00:39:56,796
Look, people talk about loving their pet,

966
00:39:56,796 --> 00:39:57,846
or their car.

967
00:39:57,846 --> 00:39:59,283
- Or pizza.

968
00:39:59,283 --> 00:40:00,707
- Or pizza.

969
00:40:00,707 --> 00:40:02,208
My word has one use.

970
00:40:02,208 --> 00:40:07,123
It's not some feeling or urge
or perennial inner conflict.

971
00:40:07,123 --> 00:40:09,290
It's a state of existence,

972
00:40:10,396 --> 00:40:14,333
when one's life becomes
enmeshed in another.

973
00:40:14,333 --> 00:40:18,283
When the other dominates
your thoughts and demands,

974
00:40:18,283 --> 00:40:19,273
a definition of your life.

975
00:40:19,273 --> 00:40:23,409
I mean, some people talk
about loving their spouses

976
00:40:23,409 --> 00:40:25,296
as much as they love a good cup of coffee.

977
00:40:25,296 --> 00:40:27,273
And that's just never been enough

978
00:40:27,273 --> 00:40:29,696
of a promise for me anyway.

979
00:40:29,696 --> 00:40:32,996
- And what's the word for all
of this spiritual perfection?

980
00:40:32,996 --> 00:40:35,046
- It's not spiritual perfection,

981
00:40:35,046 --> 00:40:37,230
it's self-actualization.

982
00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:39,746
But coming up with a word
was just as difficult

983
00:40:39,746 --> 00:40:43,633
as coming up with this abstract
ideal that I believe in.

984
00:40:43,633 --> 00:40:47,061
I chose my word from the
romantic writings on love,

985
00:40:47,061 --> 00:40:50,949
before modern society
obliterated it's meaning.

986
00:40:50,949 --> 00:40:53,936
The word comes from the writings
of Plato and Campanella,

987
00:40:53,936 --> 00:40:56,559
and the stories of Cupid and Penelope.

988
00:40:56,559 --> 00:40:58,999
It's when the state of the ideal was held

989
00:40:58,999 --> 00:41:02,286
with such reverence, that
men would kill and die

990
00:41:02,286 --> 00:41:05,534
just for the slightest
chance of obtaining it.

991
00:41:05,534 --> 00:41:08,786
That's the era from
which I derive my word.

992
00:41:08,786 --> 00:41:12,134
I know it may be foolishly idealistic,

993
00:41:12,134 --> 00:41:14,634
but that's the true basis of romanticism

994
00:41:14,634 --> 00:41:16,884
which I like to believe in.

995
00:41:17,773 --> 00:41:19,606
- And what's the word?

996
00:41:20,623 --> 00:41:21,456
- Cytalia.

997
00:41:22,673 --> 00:41:23,590
- Cytalia?

998
00:41:24,997 --> 00:41:26,164
How's it used?

999
00:41:27,046 --> 00:41:29,123
- It's independent of all others.

1000
00:41:29,123 --> 00:41:30,336
It only has one use.

1001
00:41:30,336 --> 00:41:32,136
And that way it's not open for misuse

1002
00:41:32,136 --> 00:41:34,448
or misinterpretation.

1003
00:41:34,448 --> 00:41:36,536
When someone says it, that's it.

1004
00:41:36,536 --> 00:41:40,263
Everything else is just confirmation.

1005
00:41:40,263 --> 00:41:42,547
- It sounds like you've
given this a lot of thought.

1006
00:41:42,547 --> 00:41:44,813
It must mean a lot to you.

1007
00:41:44,813 --> 00:41:46,786
- Nah, I just wrote my
college thesis on it,

1008
00:41:46,786 --> 00:41:49,273
because nothing else came to mind.

1009
00:41:49,273 --> 00:41:51,023
There's nothing like writing
80 pages on something

1010
00:41:51,023 --> 00:41:55,236
that most people can
describe in one sentence.

1011
00:41:55,236 --> 00:41:57,099
It certainly gives one
a heightened perception

1012
00:41:57,099 --> 00:41:58,713
of what the word love means,

1013
00:41:58,713 --> 00:42:02,713
when you spend that much
time thinking about it.

1014
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:07,847
- What do you think about that?

1015
00:42:07,847 --> 00:42:08,680
- Nice.

1016
00:42:14,723 --> 00:42:15,556
- Nice?

1017
00:42:17,547 --> 00:42:18,630
- Very nice.

1018
00:42:28,273 --> 00:42:29,440
- You like it?

1019
00:42:30,749 --> 00:42:33,666
- Leslie, I love when you do that.

- What do you mean?

1045
00:44:39,241 --> 00:44:42,114
- I mean, dinner a la Dali,

1046
00:44:42,114 --> 00:44:45,311
the flowers, the candles, everything.

1047
00:44:45,311 --> 00:44:46,989
- Don't you think you're worth it?

1048
00:44:46,989 --> 00:44:48,951
- It's not about what I think.

1049
00:44:48,951 --> 00:44:51,759
- Yes, I think you're worth it.

1050
00:44:51,759 --> 00:44:54,255
Every sonnet, every kiss,

1051
00:44:54,255 --> 00:44:56,338
every whisper, all of it.

1052
00:44:57,611 --> 00:44:59,077
- Be careful.

1053
00:44:59,077 --> 00:45:00,635
You might spoil me.

1054
00:45:00,635 --> 00:45:03,681
- Hmm, every minute of
every hour of every day.

1055
00:45:03,681 --> 00:45:05,014
If you'd let me.

1056
00:45:06,045 --> 00:45:08,971
- What did I ever do to deserve you?

1057
00:45:08,971 --> 00:45:12,573
- [Rob] I think I should be
asking that question of you.

1058
00:45:12,573 --> 00:45:15,953
- There is definitely something
very unusual going on here.

1059
00:45:15,953 --> 00:45:16,965
- What do you mean?

1060
00:45:16,965 --> 00:45:19,665
- You know what I mean,
don't play naive with me.

1061
00:45:19,665 --> 00:45:20,941
- I have no idea.

1062
00:45:20,941 --> 00:45:24,113
- You know, these intoxicating moods

1063
00:45:24,113 --> 00:45:26,231
that frequently overcome us,

1064
00:45:26,231 --> 00:45:28,803
and these classically romantic mindsets

1065
00:45:28,803 --> 00:45:30,845
that we keep finding ourselves in,

1066
00:45:30,845 --> 00:45:35,005
and this magical courtship
blossoming around us.

1067
00:45:35,005 --> 00:45:36,787
You noticed right?

1068
00:45:36,787 --> 00:45:37,704
- Oh, that.

1069
00:45:40,178 --> 00:45:42,095
It's pretty great, huh?

1070
00:45:43,441 --> 00:45:44,274
- Ideal.

1071
00:45:45,417 --> 00:45:47,750
- And do you ever wonder how

1072
00:45:49,787 --> 00:45:51,537
rare what we have is?

1073
00:45:52,737 --> 00:45:53,737
- Every day.

1074
00:45:54,830 --> 00:45:58,587
One with a limited vocabulary
may even call it, love,

1075
00:45:58,587 --> 00:46:00,395
for lack of a better word.

1076
00:46:00,395 --> 00:46:01,395
- One might.

1077
00:46:02,278 --> 00:46:05,255
- I don't know anyone
who has what we have.

1078
00:46:05,255 --> 00:46:07,141
- [Rob] Lasagna?

1079
00:46:07,141 --> 00:46:08,224
- You behave.

1080
00:46:09,197 --> 00:46:11,301
I don't think my parents have it,

1081
00:46:11,301 --> 00:46:13,135
I don't think they ever did.

1082
00:46:13,135 --> 00:46:14,069
Yours?

1083
00:46:14,069 --> 00:46:18,986
- No, my mom's great, but she's
not a member of that elite.

1084
00:46:19,909 --> 00:46:22,253
I think it takes a certain type of person.

1085
00:46:22,253 --> 00:46:24,787
It's just not who she is.

1086
00:46:24,787 --> 00:46:27,297
My dad certainly doesn't have it.

1087
00:46:27,297 --> 00:46:30,261
- I don't understand what's
between you and your father.

1088
00:46:30,261 --> 00:46:31,664
He's always so nice,

1089
00:46:31,664 --> 00:46:35,669
but there's such a chasm
between the two of you.

1090
00:46:35,669 --> 00:46:39,583
- You've seen him the best he's ever been.

1091
00:46:39,583 --> 00:46:41,676
I don't know, when you're around,

1092
00:46:41,676 --> 00:46:44,731
he's more like a dad than he's ever been.

1093
00:46:44,731 --> 00:46:46,614
It is strange.

1094
00:46:46,614 --> 00:46:48,033
- Why? What's wrong?

1095
00:46:48,033 --> 00:46:49,528
What's between you two?

1096
00:46:49,528 --> 00:46:50,361
- I don't know,

1097
00:46:50,361 --> 00:46:53,471
none of the things I expected, I guess.

1098
00:46:53,471 --> 00:46:55,638
Maybe I expected too much.

1099
00:46:56,730 --> 00:46:57,856
I certainly didn't have
a perfect childhood,

1100
00:46:57,856 --> 00:47:00,703
but then again, who does?

1101
00:47:00,703 --> 00:47:01,989
I don't know.

1102
00:47:01,989 --> 00:47:03,264
I blame my father for so many things,

1103
00:47:03,264 --> 00:47:05,604
because I feel like I missed out,

1104
00:47:05,604 --> 00:47:07,687
and we can never go back.

1105
00:47:08,838 --> 00:47:11,444
He's been an alcoholic for
as long as I can remember.

1106
00:47:11,444 --> 00:47:13,527
And I hated him for that.

1107
00:47:16,529 --> 00:47:19,196
I guess if I felt like he'd just

1108
00:47:20,402 --> 00:47:22,624
try to be my dad,

1109
00:47:22,624 --> 00:47:25,541
then maybe we could bridge the gap.

1110
00:47:27,067 --> 00:47:30,066
Meet halfway or something, I don't know.

1111
00:47:30,066 --> 00:47:31,912
For as much time as I've
spent thinking about it,

1112
00:47:31,912 --> 00:47:35,112
there are no answers to be
had, no good ones anyway.

1113
00:47:35,112 --> 00:47:39,754
And how in the world did
we get on this anyway?

1114
00:47:39,754 --> 00:47:41,158
- I don't know.

1115
00:47:41,158 --> 00:47:44,160
- All right, change of topic.

1116
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:45,980
Are you ready for your present?

1117
00:47:45,980 --> 00:47:47,485
- [Leslie] What present?

1118
00:47:47,485 --> 00:47:49,880
- Don't tell me you forgot what today is.

1119
00:47:49,880 --> 00:47:51,360
- Today isn't a holiday.

1120
00:47:51,360 --> 00:47:55,234
- Actually, today is the
midpoint between your birthdays,

1121
00:47:55,234 --> 00:47:57,067
six months to the day.

1122
00:47:58,561 --> 00:48:00,450
- You got me a half-birthday present?

1123
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:02,117
- You're gonna flip.

1124
00:48:05,574 --> 00:48:06,574
- Oh, my God.

1125
00:48:08,418 --> 00:48:09,719
- You always wanted to go.

1126
00:48:09,719 --> 00:48:11,175
Three weeks, we go.

1127
00:48:11,175 --> 00:48:13,436
- Oh, why would you do this for no reason?

1128
00:48:13,436 --> 00:48:14,570
- You're not actually gonna make me

1129
00:48:14,570 --> 00:48:16,820
answer that again, are you?

1130
00:48:17,808 --> 00:48:18,891
- Thank you.

1131
00:48:27,946 --> 00:48:28,779
- Did you call in the gelatin?

1132
00:48:28,779 --> 00:48:29,612
Because if we don't have that

1133
00:48:29,612 --> 00:48:31,005
by Tuesday morning 10 o'clock,

1134
00:48:31,005 --> 00:48:33,045
we eat a 30% penalty.

1135
00:48:33,045 --> 00:48:34,048
No pun intended.

1136
00:48:34,048 --> 00:48:34,881
- I know.

1137
00:48:34,881 --> 00:48:35,854
Look, I took care of it.

1138
00:48:35,854 --> 00:48:37,584
Nothing to worry about.

1139
00:48:37,584 --> 00:48:38,676
- What about the gull wing Mercedes?

1140
00:48:38,676 --> 00:48:39,533
I didn't call on that.

1141
00:48:39,533 --> 00:48:41,469
- I talked to him yesterday,

1142
00:48:41,469 --> 00:48:42,302
and everything will be done

1143
00:48:42,302 --> 00:48:43,471
by the time you get back, all right?

1144
00:48:43,471 --> 00:48:45,541
So you take it easy.

1145
00:48:45,541 --> 00:48:47,059
Everything's in good hands.

1146
00:48:47,059 --> 00:48:49,957
- I thought I was leaving things with you?

1147
00:48:49,957 --> 00:48:50,790
- Have a nice trip.

1148
00:48:50,790 --> 00:48:51,623
- You know how to get me.

1149
00:48:51,623 --> 00:48:52,939
- Yeah.

1150
00:48:52,939 --> 00:48:55,917
Looks like you've already been gotten.

1151
00:48:55,917 --> 00:49:00,800
(light Caribbean music)

1152
00:49:25,728 --> 00:49:26,880
- Checking in, sir?

1153
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,206
- Yes, Rob Provis.

1154
00:49:28,206 --> 00:49:29,039
- Okay.

1155
00:49:29,039 --> 00:49:30,356
- What time is it here?

1156
00:49:30,356 --> 00:49:32,356
- It's ten minutes of eleven.

1157
00:49:33,418 --> 00:49:34,418
- Thank you.

1158
00:49:36,546 --> 00:49:40,463
(sentimental orchestral music)

1159
00:49:58,996 --> 00:49:59,996
- Thank you.

1160
00:50:08,796 --> 00:50:12,296
- Make some memories while you're with us.

1161
00:50:13,494 --> 00:50:16,744
(romantic piano music)

1162
00:50:30,734 --> 00:50:31,567
- Cytalia.

1163
00:50:35,321 --> 00:50:36,738
Thank you, honey.

1164
00:50:44,122 --> 00:50:46,670
(laughing)

1165
00:50:46,670 --> 00:50:47,737
How was your dinner?

1166
00:50:47,737 --> 00:50:52,442
- Scrumptious, but for $4,000
I would expect nothing less.

1167
00:50:52,442 --> 00:50:53,392
- It's hard to get accustomed to it.

1168
00:50:53,392 --> 00:50:56,602
Felt just as odd giving
a cab driver a $500 tip.

1169
00:50:56,602 --> 00:50:58,956
- How much was that?

1170
00:50:58,956 --> 00:51:01,373
- About eight bucks, I think.

1171
00:51:10,369 --> 00:51:14,036
- Rob, I'm having a
wonderful time with you.

1172
00:51:17,184 --> 00:51:21,264
I don't want to make you
feel awkward or anything but,

1173
00:51:21,264 --> 00:51:25,764
I can't help but wonder how
you see things between us.

1174
00:51:34,757 --> 00:51:38,090
- I think you're amazing, you know that.

1175
00:51:42,037 --> 00:51:44,157
- I'm okay with the way things are.

1176
00:51:44,157 --> 00:51:48,907
I mean, if this is as far as
it goes, I'm okay with that.

1177
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:55,092
You are the most

1178
00:51:55,092 --> 00:52:00,092
amazing and intelligent,
compassionate man I've ever met.

1179
00:52:00,666 --> 00:52:05,249
And I would never do anything
to push you away from me.

1180
00:52:06,712 --> 00:52:07,545
I just,

1181
00:52:08,754 --> 00:52:11,671
I try not to have any expectations.

1182
00:52:12,913 --> 00:52:16,644
I am so happy every single
moment we are together,

1183
00:52:16,644 --> 00:52:19,997
and I will be for as long as it lasts.

1184
00:52:19,997 --> 00:52:22,312
I just, it's just hard for me

1185
00:52:22,312 --> 00:52:24,846
not to put myself in a position where

1186
00:52:24,846 --> 00:52:27,186
you could break my heart.

1187
00:52:27,186 --> 00:52:30,553
So I just want to get an idea from you,

1188
00:52:30,553 --> 00:52:31,999
how you see things between us,

1189
00:52:31,999 --> 00:52:34,779
and how you feel about me.

1190
00:52:34,779 --> 00:52:36,696
I'm babbling, aren't I?

1191
00:52:38,976 --> 00:52:39,978
- As long as I can remember,

1192
00:52:39,978 --> 00:52:41,785
I've never been the type of guy

1193
00:52:41,785 --> 00:52:45,061
that's been afraid of anything.

1194
00:52:45,061 --> 00:52:47,089
Always been in control.

1195
00:52:47,089 --> 00:52:47,922
When you're in control,

1196
00:52:47,922 --> 00:52:50,899
there's nothing to be afraid of.

1197
00:52:50,899 --> 00:52:54,095
This past year you've
become everything to me.

1198
00:52:54,095 --> 00:52:56,630
I can't stop thinking about you.

1199
00:52:56,630 --> 00:52:59,181
You know, I never have
a shortage of words.

1200
00:52:59,181 --> 00:53:01,818
And when I'm with you, I find myself

1201
00:53:01,818 --> 00:53:04,589
stumbling over my words.

1202
00:53:04,589 --> 00:53:08,630
Not to mention the pounding inside of me,

1203
00:53:08,630 --> 00:53:11,755
trembling of my hands when I touch you.

1204
00:53:11,755 --> 00:53:14,234
I can't control any of it.

1205
00:53:14,234 --> 00:53:17,458
It's a wonderful feeling, but it also

1206
00:53:17,458 --> 00:53:22,138
scares the hell out of me
because it's so unknown.

1207
00:53:22,138 --> 00:53:25,698
You obviously have a better
grasp of what's going on,

1208
00:53:25,698 --> 00:53:28,052
because I am spiraling blissfully

1209
00:53:28,052 --> 00:53:30,302
out of control towards you.

1210
00:53:31,456 --> 00:53:36,123
Never, never ever imagined
caring this much about a woman.

1211
00:53:37,735 --> 00:53:40,400
And I know that I can never ever

1212
00:53:40,400 --> 00:53:43,859
find somebody as special as you are.

1213
00:53:43,859 --> 00:53:45,590
Every day I find myself becoming

1214
00:53:45,590 --> 00:53:48,994
more and more infatuated with you.

1215
00:53:48,994 --> 00:53:50,244
Uncontrollably.

1216
00:53:53,077 --> 00:53:55,324
What was the question again?

1217
00:53:55,324 --> 00:53:56,907
- I don't remember.

1218
00:53:58,614 --> 00:54:01,364
(gentle waves lapping)

1219
00:54:13,551 --> 00:54:14,578
- Here?

1220
00:54:14,578 --> 00:54:15,411
- Yeah.

1221
00:54:17,711 --> 00:54:19,063
- What if someone comes?

1222
00:54:19,063 --> 00:54:20,313
- Someone will.

1223
00:54:43,570 --> 00:54:45,449
- There comes a time in a man's life

1224
00:54:45,449 --> 00:54:49,380
that circumscribes his very existence.

1225
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:52,095
When this portentous
forever reveals itself,

1226
00:54:52,095 --> 00:54:54,968
one must embrace it wholeheartedly,

1227
00:54:54,968 --> 00:54:58,244
becoming master and
servant to its beneficence,

1228
00:54:58,244 --> 00:55:00,767
or risk deprivation of the ultimate

1229
00:55:00,767 --> 00:55:03,278
irreplaceable delectation,

1230
00:55:03,278 --> 00:55:05,361
that oh so rarely occurs,

1231
00:55:07,084 --> 00:55:11,501
and never recurs, in the
brevity of one's lifetime.

1232
00:55:13,350 --> 00:55:16,094
- Those are some pretty big
words there, college boy.

1233
00:55:16,094 --> 00:55:17,290
What have you been out doing?

1234
00:55:17,290 --> 00:55:18,896
Boning a librarian?

1235
00:55:18,896 --> 00:55:19,729
Or have you been sleeping

1236
00:55:19,729 --> 00:55:22,646
with a thesaurus under your pillow?

1237
00:55:30,748 --> 00:55:32,081
Wow. Congratulations.

1238
00:55:36,610 --> 00:55:37,443
- You know, I was thinking today

1239
00:55:37,443 --> 00:55:38,733
of a lot of things, actually.

1240
00:55:38,733 --> 00:55:40,491
I was thinking of all the
things that people do,

1241
00:55:40,491 --> 00:55:42,779
not based on their own
feelings or judgements,

1242
00:55:42,779 --> 00:55:44,571
but based on a reaction to what others

1243
00:55:44,571 --> 00:55:46,404
are doing around them.

1244
00:55:47,383 --> 00:55:48,398
Art.

1245
00:55:48,398 --> 00:55:51,101
Everybody wants to be
chic and have good taste,

1246
00:55:51,101 --> 00:55:52,454
but none of them have the courage

1247
00:55:52,454 --> 00:55:53,558
to stand by their convictions

1248
00:55:53,558 --> 00:55:56,978
of what they judge to be
good taste as being enough.

1249
00:55:56,978 --> 00:55:58,861
That's the way art is now.

1250
00:55:58,861 --> 00:56:01,645
Some charlatan will convince
the right person of influence

1251
00:56:01,645 --> 00:56:02,608
to say that they're great,

1252
00:56:02,608 --> 00:56:05,533
and the masses will follow out
of a desire for affiliation.

1253
00:56:05,533 --> 00:56:07,898
I mean, look at Jackson Pollack.

1254
00:56:07,898 --> 00:56:09,239
I mean, who in their right mind would look

1255
00:56:09,239 --> 00:56:11,787
at this man and say, 'Boy, he's gifted.'

1256
00:56:11,787 --> 00:56:13,358
'I wish I could paint like that.'

1257
00:56:13,358 --> 00:56:14,554
'I mean, Michelangelo's great,'

1258
00:56:14,554 --> 00:56:16,713
'but this man has truly
been touched by God.'

1259
00:56:16,713 --> 00:56:20,003
'And you should see the
masterpiece his cat painted!'

1260
00:56:20,003 --> 00:56:22,499
Did you ever read Sylvia Plath?

1261
00:56:22,499 --> 00:56:23,772
- Sure.

1262
00:56:23,772 --> 00:56:25,709
- All right, she's okay at best,

1263
00:56:25,709 --> 00:56:28,140
but she's popular because
it's hip and fashionable

1264
00:56:28,140 --> 00:56:32,598
to be some misunderstood
suicidal, manic poet.

1265
00:56:32,598 --> 00:56:33,939
It must be a sign of talent,

1266
00:56:33,939 --> 00:56:35,329
you know, the cost of greatness.

1267
00:56:35,329 --> 00:56:37,278
'To be great is to be misunderstood,'

1268
00:56:37,278 --> 00:56:39,112
but the reverse certainly
doesn't always apply.

1269
00:56:39,112 --> 00:56:40,241
The masses will buy into anything

1270
00:56:40,241 --> 00:56:41,142
as being trendy and hip enough

1271
00:56:41,142 --> 00:56:42,845
if it comes from the right source,

1272
00:56:42,845 --> 00:56:45,380
or even the wrong source,
if it's prevalent enough.

1273
00:56:45,380 --> 00:56:47,197
I mean we're only a couple of
celebrity endorsements away

1274
00:56:47,197 --> 00:56:48,944
from making nose-picking the new trend.

1275
00:56:48,944 --> 00:56:51,065
Why are people so afraid to just say

1276
00:56:51,065 --> 00:56:53,887
to hell with everyone else?

1277
00:56:53,887 --> 00:56:55,804
- Rob, you're babbling.

1278
00:56:58,514 --> 00:56:59,764
- You're right.

1279
00:57:02,713 --> 00:57:04,339
What I'm getting at,

1280
00:57:04,339 --> 00:57:05,976
what I'm trying to say is that in my life

1281
00:57:05,976 --> 00:57:09,726
I've never cared about
being accepted before.

1282
00:57:11,307 --> 00:57:12,474
And, right now

1283
00:57:15,201 --> 00:57:16,840
it is the only thing

1284
00:57:16,840 --> 00:57:19,507
in the world that matters to me.

1285
00:57:26,655 --> 00:57:30,905
- I'm not a conformist
either, so I have to refuse.

1286
00:57:33,128 --> 00:57:37,628
However, since we are on the
topic, will you marry me?

1287
00:57:41,035 --> 00:57:41,952
- I accept.

1288
00:57:44,245 --> 00:57:48,245
(sentimental orchestral music)

1289
00:57:54,980 --> 00:57:57,263
- You know that night
we met at the airport,

1290
00:57:57,263 --> 00:58:02,057
I had so many emotions running
through me I, I felt dizzy.

1291
00:58:02,057 --> 00:58:05,205
And then when I saw you I
knew I had to talk to you,

1292
00:58:05,205 --> 00:58:07,596
and I couldn't stop it.

1293
00:58:07,596 --> 00:58:10,793
And then we started talking,
and it just clicked,

1294
00:58:10,793 --> 00:58:12,835
and I knew why.

1295
00:58:12,835 --> 00:58:15,096
I started to melt.

1296
00:58:15,096 --> 00:58:18,929
I was so excited and so
nervous and attracted.

1297
00:58:20,336 --> 00:58:21,481
I just wanted so much for you to be

1298
00:58:21,481 --> 00:58:24,926
everything you seemed to
be in that first moment.

1299
00:58:24,926 --> 00:58:28,865
- In that one instant, you
became a part of me too.

1300
00:58:28,865 --> 00:58:30,345
On the ride to the police station,

1301
00:58:30,345 --> 00:58:32,415
I was smiling thinking of you.

1302
00:58:32,415 --> 00:58:34,582
Everything was so perfect.

1303
00:58:35,598 --> 00:58:37,629
I was sure you'd be there when I got back.

1304
00:58:37,629 --> 00:58:39,771
When I realized you weren't there,

1305
00:58:39,771 --> 00:58:44,725
it killed me, but I knew,
I knew I'd find you again.

1306
00:58:44,725 --> 00:58:47,079
- I almost was still there.

1307
00:58:47,079 --> 00:58:49,422
I was in my car and I
just wanted to turn around

1308
00:58:49,422 --> 00:58:51,738
and go back and wait for you.

1309
00:58:51,738 --> 00:58:53,322
And then when I first saw the flyers,

1310
00:58:53,322 --> 00:58:57,108
I just wanted to call you so
badly and talk to you again.

1311
00:58:57,108 --> 00:59:00,550
And that phone number and your eyes

1312
00:59:00,550 --> 00:59:04,492
kept flashing in my mind
every day and every hour,

1313
00:59:04,492 --> 00:59:06,478
but I was afraid.

1314
00:59:06,478 --> 00:59:07,395
- Of what?

1315
00:59:08,340 --> 00:59:09,262
- I was afraid because I knew

1316
00:59:09,262 --> 00:59:11,511
I fall for you so completely,

1317
00:59:11,511 --> 00:59:13,852
and that if somehow it didn't work out,

1318
00:59:13,852 --> 00:59:16,154
I would never find it again.

1319
00:59:16,154 --> 00:59:18,337
- It all worked out.

1320
00:59:18,337 --> 00:59:20,920
- It did, kind of like a dream.

1321
00:59:25,941 --> 00:59:27,775
Thank you, Rob.

1322
00:59:27,775 --> 00:59:28,905
- For what?

1323
00:59:28,905 --> 00:59:30,145
- For being everything you seemed to be

1324
00:59:30,145 --> 00:59:31,895
in that first moment.

1325
00:59:34,032 --> 00:59:37,007
So, are we going back to your place?

1326
00:59:37,007 --> 00:59:39,621
- Don't you mean our place?

1327
00:59:39,621 --> 00:59:40,887
- How do you know that I'm
not gonna make you sell it

1328
00:59:40,887 --> 00:59:45,804
and buy some big mansion with
cooks and servants and maids?

1329
00:59:46,711 --> 00:59:49,779
- Whatever you want, honey.

1330
00:59:49,779 --> 00:59:52,279
- I just want it to never end.

1331
00:59:53,717 --> 00:59:58,717
(tires squealing)
(cars crashing)

1332
01:00:17,369 --> 01:00:18,202
- Honey?

1333
01:00:24,609 --> 01:00:25,442
Leslie!

1334
01:00:27,743 --> 01:00:31,788
No no no no, baby no, no, no, no, no baby.

1335
01:00:31,788 --> 01:00:33,038
No no, Leslie.

1336
01:00:35,127 --> 01:00:39,271
Please, please, please,
please, please, please, baby.

1337
01:00:39,271 --> 01:00:41,951
Oh, baby, please say something.

1338
01:00:41,951 --> 01:00:44,284
Please baby, open your eyes.

1339
01:00:46,815 --> 01:00:49,232
Please baby, open your eyes.

1340
01:00:50,340 --> 01:00:51,173
Please.

1341
01:00:57,177 --> 01:00:58,510
Please, help us!

1342
01:01:01,089 --> 01:01:01,922
Help us.

1343
01:01:11,192 --> 01:01:13,388
(siren blaring)

1344
01:01:13,388 --> 01:01:16,272
- Could you step away for a moment, sir?

1345
01:01:16,272 --> 01:01:17,189
- I can't.

1346
01:01:18,692 --> 01:01:20,471
- I know, but these
guys need to get to her

1347
01:01:20,471 --> 01:01:21,888
so they can help.

1348
01:01:26,100 --> 01:01:27,375
- It's okay.

1349
01:01:27,375 --> 01:01:28,714
I'm here now.

1350
01:01:28,714 --> 01:01:30,464
You're gonna be okay.

1351
01:01:31,965 --> 01:01:33,834
They'll get you all fixed up,

1352
01:01:33,834 --> 01:01:36,642
and we'll go away again, okay?

1353
01:01:36,642 --> 01:01:38,059
Would you like that?

1354
01:01:38,985 --> 01:01:41,402
Make love on the beach again?

1355
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:48,075
We'll get married soon as
you want honey, I promise.

1356
01:01:49,330 --> 01:01:52,247
I promise, we're gonna get married.

1357
01:01:56,586 --> 01:01:58,919
Say something honey, please.

1358
01:01:59,771 --> 01:02:01,938
(quiet sobbing)

1359
01:02:09,637 --> 01:02:13,137
(somber orchestral music)

1360
01:02:41,711 --> 01:02:45,337
Gonna take some time to
get things back to normal.

1361
01:02:45,337 --> 01:02:47,837
She's gonna be a while, I guess.

1362
01:02:50,031 --> 01:02:51,864
She's hurt pretty bad.

1363
01:02:55,775 --> 01:02:57,942
She really likes the ring.

1364
01:03:04,459 --> 01:03:06,553
- [Doctor] I'm very sorry.

1365
01:03:06,553 --> 01:03:07,386
- No.

1366
01:03:13,923 --> 01:03:17,590
(dramatic orchestral music)

1367
01:03:41,497 --> 01:03:42,330
- Rob?

1368
01:03:59,201 --> 01:04:01,984
We're gonna get through this, man.

1369
01:04:01,984 --> 01:04:04,169
We're gonna get through this.

1370
01:04:04,169 --> 01:04:06,252
(crying)

1371
01:04:10,735 --> 01:04:13,902

It's a 17th century Ballock knife.

- That's pretty amazing.

1388
01:06:31,988 --> 01:06:33,613
- There aren't many of these still around,

1389
01:06:33,613 --> 01:06:35,860
and even fewer have the sheath.

1390
01:06:35,860 --> 01:06:37,264
- It's beautiful.

1391
01:06:37,264 --> 01:06:40,138
- I swung a good deal for it, too.

1392
01:06:40,138 --> 01:06:41,518

- Hi.

1399
01:07:05,448 --> 01:07:07,673
You know I just remembered,
I got to go by the office,

1400
01:07:07,673 --> 01:07:10,586
and get some stuff for the
accountant for tomorrow.

1401
01:07:10,586 --> 01:07:12,184
I gotta go.

1402
01:07:12,184 --> 01:07:14,184
Show me later, okay mom?

1403
01:07:18,110 --> 01:07:20,582

1434
01:11:02,225 --> 01:11:03,796
- Hey.

1435
01:11:03,796 --> 01:11:04,629
- Look, um,

1436
01:11:06,112 --> 01:11:08,110
everybody at work's been asking about you.

1437
01:11:08,110 --> 01:11:12,650
You know, they want to know
when you're gonna be back.

1438
01:11:12,650 --> 01:11:14,522
What do you think I should tell them?

1439
01:11:14,522 --> 01:11:15,772
- I don't care.

1440
01:11:17,053 --> 01:11:18,457
- You look bad, Rob.

1441
01:11:18,457 --> 01:11:19,604
- Your point?

1442
01:11:19,604 --> 01:11:21,334
- I want to help you.

1443
01:11:21,334 --> 01:11:23,167
- You've been helping.

1444
01:11:24,090 --> 01:11:26,014
Look, you run the business
as well as I ever did.

1445
01:11:26,014 --> 01:11:28,264
I just need you to keep doing it for me.

1446
01:11:28,264 --> 01:11:31,422
- Okay, but we still need you back.

1447
01:11:31,422 --> 01:11:33,005
- Did you see this?

1448
01:11:34,022 --> 01:11:35,242
- Yeah, I saw it.

1449
01:11:35,242 --> 01:11:37,245
I talked to your mom.

1450
01:11:37,245 --> 01:11:39,388
- How does something like
that happen, you know?

1451
01:11:39,388 --> 01:11:41,690
How does a murder not even go to court?

1452
01:11:41,690 --> 01:11:43,233
- The system's fucked, Rob.

1453
01:11:43,233 --> 01:11:44,066
Okay?

1454
01:11:44,066 --> 01:11:45,836
- Jesus Christ, I mean,
that's all it takes

1455
01:11:45,836 --> 01:11:47,084
to absolve a drunk driver,

1456
01:11:47,084 --> 01:11:50,751
is just pick up some
trash and see a doctor.

1457
01:11:51,816 --> 01:11:53,948
I know there's an irony
in there somewhere,

1458
01:11:53,948 --> 01:11:55,615
I just can't see it.

1459
01:11:57,602 --> 01:12:00,602
- Look, it's been almost a year Rob.

1460
01:12:01,633 --> 01:12:02,466
Okay?

1461
01:12:02,466 --> 01:12:05,950
I mean, there's nothing to grasp.

1462
01:12:05,950 --> 01:12:07,700
You got to let it go.

1463
01:12:24,405 --> 01:12:27,848
Is there anything that I can do?

1464
01:12:27,848 --> 01:12:31,592
- Just keep doing what you've been doing.

1465
01:12:31,592 --> 01:12:32,697
I really appreciate it.

1466
01:12:32,697 --> 01:12:34,297
- All right.

1467
01:12:34,297 --> 01:12:35,857
Listen, you know,

1468
01:12:35,857 --> 01:12:38,949
you know that I'm here for you, right?

1469
01:12:38,949 --> 01:12:39,782
Take care.

1470
01:12:42,303 --> 01:12:45,636
(ominous orchestral music)

1471
01:13:38,170 --> 01:13:41,503
(train whistle blowing)

1472
01:13:45,114 --> 01:13:47,531
(TV playing in distance)

1473
01:14:07,659 --> 01:14:10,992
(sad orchestral music)

1474
01:14:24,105 --> 01:14:26,237
(girls screaming)

1475
01:14:26,237 --> 01:14:27,745
- You did it!

1476
01:14:27,745 --> 01:14:28,667
You killed her!

1477
01:14:28,667 --> 01:14:29,719
You killed her!

1478
01:14:29,719 --> 01:14:32,633
She was all I had, everything, everything.

1479
01:14:32,633 --> 01:14:34,114
- I'm sorry man, I'm so sorry.

1480
01:14:34,114 --> 01:14:36,364
- Everything I ever wanted.

1481
01:14:37,729 --> 01:14:39,896
She was all I ever wanted.

1482
01:14:42,538 --> 01:14:45,989
I finally found someone that was perfect.

1483
01:14:46,854 --> 01:14:50,854
Never know what that was
before. She wanted me.

1484
01:14:52,040 --> 01:14:55,123
She loved me, wanted me to marry her.

1485
01:14:56,471 --> 01:14:58,477
I was supposed to marry her.

1486
01:14:58,477 --> 01:15:01,310
I promised, and you took her away.

1487
01:15:02,350 --> 01:15:04,600
You took her away from me.

1488
01:15:05,667 --> 01:15:06,500
My wife.

1489
01:15:06,500 --> 01:15:07,333
- No!

1490
01:15:07,333 --> 01:15:08,166
- Why?

1491
01:15:11,352 --> 01:15:13,484
She was everything.

1492
01:15:13,484 --> 01:15:16,576
Don't you know what that means?

1493
01:15:16,576 --> 01:15:17,659
What you did.

1494
01:15:19,565 --> 01:15:20,398
- Yes.

1495
01:15:22,026 --> 01:15:22,859
I know.

1496
01:15:23,935 --> 01:15:24,768
I'm sorry.

1497
01:15:25,666 --> 01:15:26,749
I'm so sorry.

1498
01:15:31,982 --> 01:15:33,232
- She loved me.

1499
01:15:35,206 --> 01:15:36,039
- I know.

1500
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,340
(car beeping)

1501
01:16:41,572 --> 01:16:44,155
(gun clicks)

1502
01:16:51,398 --> 01:16:53,981
(gun clicks)

1503
01:16:58,458 --> 01:17:00,625
(sobbing)

1504
01:17:14,941 --> 01:17:18,608
(solemn instrumental music)

1505
01:18:03,601 --> 01:18:04,434
- Woo!

1506
01:18:12,441 --> 01:18:13,274
- Hi, Rob.

1507
01:18:27,299 --> 01:18:28,799
- I missed you, Rob.

1508
01:18:41,093 --> 01:18:41,926
- Leslie.

1509
01:18:44,057 --> 01:18:45,640
I love you so much.

1510
01:18:47,992 --> 01:18:49,060
But I saw-

1511
01:18:49,060 --> 01:18:49,893
- Shh.

1512
01:18:51,895 --> 01:18:54,469
It doesn't matter, anymore.

1513
01:18:54,469 --> 01:18:55,302
I'm here.

1514
01:18:56,304 --> 01:18:58,304
- But you can't be here.

1515
01:18:59,202 --> 01:19:01,334
- Forget about all that.

1516
01:19:01,334 --> 01:19:02,167
I'm here.

1517
01:19:05,479 --> 01:19:07,715
- I wanted to see you again.

1518
01:19:07,715 --> 01:19:09,882
Just to be with you again.

1519
01:19:11,511 --> 01:19:14,139
- It doesn't matter anymore, Rob.

1520
01:19:14,139 --> 01:19:14,972
I'm here.

1521
01:19:16,971 --> 01:19:17,804
- But how?

1522
01:19:19,637 --> 01:19:21,720
I don't understand, how?

1523
01:19:23,135 --> 01:19:25,631
- No more questions, Rob.

1524
01:19:25,631 --> 01:19:28,631
You've always believed in me before.

1525
01:19:32,845 --> 01:19:34,095
It's all right.

1526
01:19:35,237 --> 01:19:37,295
- Let's just be together again.

1527
01:19:39,595 --> 01:19:41,211
- Come on.

1528
01:19:42,269 --> 01:19:44,852
(enchanted music)

1529
01:19:51,953 --> 01:19:53,813
- Are you real?

1530
01:19:53,813 --> 01:19:56,063
- That's a question of definition,

1531
01:19:56,063 --> 01:19:57,980
but I am here with you.

1532
01:20:00,015 --> 01:20:01,098
Is that enough?

1533
01:20:01,977 --> 01:20:03,783
- It's always been enough.

1534
01:20:03,783 --> 01:20:05,533
- It's been everything.

1535
01:20:27,509 --> 01:20:29,676
(beeping)

1536
01:20:32,529 --> 01:20:33,811
- Again.

1537
01:20:33,811 --> 01:20:37,811
(sentimental orchestral music)

1538
01:20:42,336 --> 01:20:44,003
- Hey, what's wrong?

1539
01:20:46,368 --> 01:20:47,701
- It's too soon.

1540
01:20:49,488 --> 01:20:50,996
- What is it, baby?

1541
01:20:50,996 --> 01:20:52,246
- I have to go.

1542
01:20:53,311 --> 01:20:55,287
- You can't go.

1543
01:20:55,287 --> 01:20:56,754
You just got back.

1544
01:20:56,754 --> 01:20:57,587
You can't.

1545
01:20:59,225 --> 01:21:02,058
- It's not up to me. I have to go.

1546
01:21:03,719 --> 01:21:05,969
- You can't leave me again.

1547
01:21:06,920 --> 01:21:09,043
I want to marry you.

1548
01:21:09,043 --> 01:21:11,591
I promised I'd marry you.

1549
01:21:11,591 --> 01:21:13,852
- I wish I could stay forever,

1550
01:21:13,852 --> 01:21:16,152
but I can't Rob, I have to go now.

1551
01:21:16,152 --> 01:21:18,649
- Leslie, I love you.

1552
01:21:18,649 --> 01:21:20,677
You're all I want.

1553
01:21:20,677 --> 01:21:23,225
All I've ever wanted.

1554
01:21:23,225 --> 01:21:25,604
You can't leave me.

1555
01:21:25,604 --> 01:21:27,021
If you leave me.

1556
01:21:29,677 --> 01:21:33,956
There's nothing else for me, nothing left.

1557
01:21:33,956 --> 01:21:36,996
- If I could stay, you know, I would Rob.

1558
01:21:36,996 --> 01:21:39,804
I do love you completely,

1559
01:21:39,804 --> 01:21:41,221
but I can't stay.

1560
01:21:42,380 --> 01:21:43,369
I have to go.

1561
01:21:43,369 --> 01:21:46,007
- Please, you can't leave me.

1562
01:21:46,007 --> 01:21:47,674
I want to marry you.

1563
01:21:48,594 --> 01:21:51,362
That's all that matters, now.

1564
01:21:51,362 --> 01:21:53,572
I believe everything.

1565
01:21:53,572 --> 01:21:55,156
All of it.

1566
01:21:55,156 --> 01:21:56,406
Please, Leslie.

1567
01:21:58,238 --> 01:21:59,571
- I'm sorry, Rob.

1568
01:22:08,471 --> 01:22:11,316
There's someone out there for you.

1569
01:22:11,316 --> 01:22:13,816
A person, someone to live for.

1570
01:22:14,815 --> 01:22:15,648
Find her.

1571
01:22:17,648 --> 01:22:20,898
I promise you everything will work out.

1572
01:22:22,457 --> 01:22:25,540
Whatever happens, just believe in me.

1573
01:22:27,386 --> 01:22:30,381
That's what brought me
back to you tonight.

1574
01:22:30,381 --> 01:22:32,548
- Please, don't leave me.

1575
01:22:33,837 --> 01:22:36,399
Everything I ever did,

1576
01:22:36,399 --> 01:22:39,741
everything I ever was, was because of you.

1577
01:22:39,741 --> 01:22:41,324
I need you, Leslie.

1578
01:22:44,809 --> 01:22:47,149
- Forgive your father, Rob.

1579
01:22:47,149 --> 01:22:49,957
He's suffering just like you are.

1580
01:22:49,957 --> 01:22:51,517
And he needs a son.

1581
01:22:51,517 --> 01:22:53,017
You need a father.

1582
01:22:54,315 --> 01:22:55,315
Goodbye, Rob.

1583
01:22:56,766 --> 01:22:59,349
You taught me what cytalia was.

1584
01:23:00,332 --> 01:23:02,249
And then you showed me.

1585
01:23:04,323 --> 01:23:06,073
I'll always love you.

1586
01:23:08,896 --> 01:23:09,729
Always.

1587
01:23:14,501 --> 01:23:16,084

1598
01:24:48,839 --> 01:24:49,672
- Rob?

1599
01:24:51,321 --> 01:24:52,154
- Hi, dad.

1600
01:24:53,425 --> 01:24:54,673
- Are you okay?

1601
01:24:54,673 --> 01:24:56,506
- Yeah, I'm all right.

1602
01:24:57,597 --> 01:24:59,575
Better than that I think.

1603
01:24:59,575 --> 01:25:00,408
- Good.

1604
01:25:00,408 --> 01:25:01,908
I'm glad I, I was,

1605
01:25:03,815 --> 01:25:06,672
I worry about you, that's all.

1606
01:25:06,672 --> 01:25:08,103
- I know.

1607
01:25:08,103 --> 01:25:09,691
I'm okay now.

1608
01:25:09,691 --> 01:25:11,390
Yeah, I wasn't there for awhile,

1609
01:25:11,390 --> 01:25:14,512
but I worked everything
out, I'm all right.

1610
01:25:14,512 --> 01:25:18,295
I just had so many
things I had to work out,

1611
01:25:18,295 --> 01:25:22,208
and I wanted so much to blame someone.

1612
01:25:22,208 --> 01:25:25,523
I blamed drinking, so I blamed you.

1613
01:25:25,523 --> 01:25:26,563
It was so easy.

1614
01:25:26,563 --> 01:25:30,177
I just took all the
differences that we had

1615
01:25:30,177 --> 01:25:32,927
and I just let it feed off of me.

1616
01:25:34,343 --> 01:25:36,863
I was wrong to shut you out.

1617
01:25:36,863 --> 01:25:38,253
Sorry.

1618
01:25:38,253 --> 01:25:39,931
I know you wanted to help me, I saw that,

1619
01:25:39,931 --> 01:25:43,495
but I just didn't want to
let anybody get too close.

1620
01:25:43,495 --> 01:25:46,662
I just thought it would hurt too much.

1621
01:25:48,411 --> 01:25:50,411
- I don't drink anymore.

1622
01:25:52,762 --> 01:25:55,154
Your mother and I loved her too, Rob.

1623
01:25:55,154 --> 01:26:00,097
When she died, we wanted so
much to be there for you,

1624
01:26:00,097 --> 01:26:02,555
but you didn't want me around.

1625
01:26:02,555 --> 01:26:06,222
And I wanted to help,
you have to know that.

1626
01:26:08,350 --> 01:26:10,598
It hit me when they said how drunk he was,

1627
01:26:10,598 --> 01:26:14,435
and I knew that you felt
it could have been me,

1628
01:26:14,435 --> 01:26:16,852
that I could have killed her.

1629
01:26:18,013 --> 01:26:20,763
I knew that was why you hated me.

1630
01:26:21,611 --> 01:26:25,028
Maybe I felt I even deserved it, I guess.

1631
01:26:26,073 --> 01:26:27,990
Never again. I promise.

1632
01:26:31,051 --> 01:26:33,311
All the things that we missed out on,

1633
01:26:33,311 --> 01:26:36,577
I can never make that up to you.

1634
01:26:36,577 --> 01:26:37,410
But, I'll try.

1635
01:26:40,123 --> 01:26:43,123
- It'll be nice to have a father.

1636
01:26:50,055 --> 01:26:52,186
I do love you, dad.

1637
01:26:52,186 --> 01:26:55,275
- I love you, too. I'm so sorry.

1638
01:26:55,275 --> 01:26:58,025
- [Rob] None of that matters, now.

1639
01:27:10,809 --> 01:27:11,642
- Rob?

1640
01:27:15,839 --> 01:27:17,006
How you doing?

1641
01:27:18,377 --> 01:27:21,482
- Things are good, it's better now.

1642
01:27:21,482 --> 01:27:23,369
- That's good, I was worried.

1643
01:27:23,369 --> 01:27:24,825
- I know.

1644
01:27:24,825 --> 01:27:28,021
Things had to work themselves out.

1645
01:27:28,021 --> 01:27:30,583
They had a strange way of doing it.

1646
01:27:30,583 --> 01:27:31,416
I'm okay.

1647
01:27:32,337 --> 01:27:33,504
Business good?

1648
01:27:34,719 --> 01:27:36,262
- Oh, yeah.

1649
01:27:36,262 --> 01:27:37,329
- Well, I'm gonna be back on Monday

1650
01:27:37,329 --> 01:27:39,590
ready to work you silly.

1651
01:27:39,590 --> 01:27:41,773
- I'm already silly.

1652
01:27:41,773 --> 01:27:43,606
- I'll see you Monday.

1653
01:27:48,485 --> 01:27:50,783
- Come on, you gotta put on your outfit.

1654
01:27:50,783 --> 01:27:51,950
- In a minute.

1655
01:27:53,306 --> 01:27:54,556
- Who was that?

1656
01:27:56,832 --> 01:27:58,714
- An old friend.

1657
01:27:58,714 --> 01:28:01,047
- He didn't sound that old.

1658
01:28:02,094 --> 01:28:03,594
- Let me see this.

1659
01:28:05,644 --> 01:28:08,933
- Why do I have to be the Cuban?

1660
01:28:08,933 --> 01:28:10,480
- The concubine.

1661
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:12,092
You're the concubine.

1662
01:28:12,092 --> 01:28:14,994
I'm the King, she's the Queen,

1663
01:28:14,994 --> 01:28:16,537
and you're the concubine.

1664
01:28:16,537 --> 01:28:20,128
It's kind of like the
King's favorite super model.

1665
01:28:20,128 --> 01:28:20,961
- Oh.

1666
01:28:24,094 --> 01:28:25,511
- And what am I?

1667
01:28:26,850 --> 01:28:28,267
- I have no idea.

1668
01:28:54,730 --> 01:28:56,013
(something small clinks to pavement

1669
01:28:59,024 --> 01:29:00,948
- Excuse me, miss.

1670
01:29:00,948 --> 01:29:01,781
- Yes?

1671
01:29:04,030 --> 01:29:05,613
- You dropped this.

1672
01:29:07,528 --> 01:29:11,028
- Beautiful, but I'm afraid it's not mine.

1673
01:29:16,105 --> 01:29:17,938
- I think, maybe it is.

1674
01:29:21,384 --> 01:29:25,217
