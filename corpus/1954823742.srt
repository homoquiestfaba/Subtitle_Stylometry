1
00:02:19,405 --> 00:02:21,273
- Emma and the kids
weren't too happy about me

2
00:02:21,275 --> 00:02:22,875
moving them closer to town,

3
00:02:22,877 --> 00:02:23,976
but it was best
for the business.

4
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:26,645
- Let me help you out here.

5
00:02:26,647 --> 00:02:28,247
- Thanks.
- - Hey, Jake.

6
00:02:28,249 --> 00:02:29,081
- Bob Collins.

7
00:02:29,083 --> 00:02:29,781
- Nice to meet you, Bob.

8
00:02:29,783 --> 00:02:31,416
- This is Seth.
- - How you doing?

9
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:32,751
- Seth Collins.
- Nice to meet you.

10
00:02:32,753 --> 00:02:34,119
- All right, good luck.
- Thanks.

11
00:02:34,121 --> 00:02:34,720
- Hello, Seth, Bob.

12
00:02:34,722 --> 00:02:35,721
- Hey, Preacher Sam!
- Looking good!

13
00:02:35,723 --> 00:02:37,489
- Preacher Sam, how you doing?

14
00:02:37,491 --> 00:02:40,159
- I'm doing good.
Well, see you all tomorrow.

15
00:02:40,161 --> 00:02:42,828
- Yeah, let's give it a ring.

16
00:02:44,598 --> 00:02:47,833
Oh yeah, should be all right.

17
00:02:49,969 --> 00:02:52,504
- I remember when Mama
used to ring that bell

18
00:02:52,506 --> 00:02:54,006
'til our feet hit
the front porch.

19
00:02:54,008 --> 00:02:57,376
Used to drive Daddy crazy.

20
00:02:57,378 --> 00:02:59,511
- He'd be proud.

21
00:03:01,081 --> 00:03:02,214
- Yes, he would.

22
00:03:02,216 --> 00:03:06,151
This is for him, for the family.

23
00:03:06,953 --> 00:03:08,453
- Collins brothers.

24
00:03:08,455 --> 00:03:10,656
We got us a business
that we can share.

25
00:03:10,658 --> 00:03:13,258
The hard work is
going to pay off, too.

26
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,426
- God's been good to us.

27
00:03:14,428 --> 00:03:16,328
I'm just happy to
have my baby brother

28
00:03:16,330 --> 00:03:18,397
as my business partner.

29
00:03:18,399 --> 00:03:19,331
Look, I gotta run.

30
00:03:19,333 --> 00:03:20,866
I gotta meet Emma and
the kids at the pond,

31
00:03:20,868 --> 00:03:22,801
and she don't like me
being late for anything.

32
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:24,803
- Well, you better go
and get out of here, Bobby.

33
00:03:24,805 --> 00:03:27,206
I'll see you and the family
tomorrow for the Grand Opening.

34
00:03:27,208 --> 00:03:28,674
- You know it.

35
00:03:28,676 --> 00:03:30,475
See you then.

36
00:03:36,950 --> 00:03:37,616
- I'm hungry, Pops.

37
00:03:37,618 --> 00:03:39,451
- Well, you know
I think Mama, she made

38
00:03:39,453 --> 00:03:41,954
some corn bread and
some homemade jam.

39
00:03:41,956 --> 00:03:42,888
Y'all ready for a picnic?

40
00:03:42,890 --> 00:03:45,857
- Yes.
- All right, come on.

41
00:03:46,626 --> 00:03:48,860
- This is for you, Miss Emma.

42
00:03:48,862 --> 00:03:51,863
- Thank you, sweetheart.

43
00:03:53,132 --> 00:03:54,566
All right.

44
00:03:56,102 --> 00:03:56,902
- Thanks, Mom!

45
00:03:56,904 --> 00:03:59,805
- Let's go.
- Michael, wait up.

46
00:04:01,674 --> 00:04:03,408
- How's the store looking?

47
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:04,476
- Tomorrow's a big day.

48
00:04:04,478 --> 00:04:06,545
We've even got Grandma's
dinner bell hanging outside.

49
00:04:06,547 --> 00:04:07,913
- That loud thing?

50
00:04:07,915 --> 00:04:10,315
I'm sure the customers are
really gonna like that.

51
00:04:10,317 --> 00:04:12,150
- It ain't that loud.

52
00:04:12,152 --> 00:04:12,851
- Yes, it is.

53
00:04:12,853 --> 00:04:14,419
That thing sounds
like a train coming.

54
00:04:14,421 --> 00:04:16,888
- Well, I'll tell you what.
We never missed a meal.

55
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:19,925
- Oh yeah, you right about that.

56
00:04:21,294 --> 00:04:22,661
- What else you got in there?

57
00:04:22,663 --> 00:04:23,862
- Some jam.

58
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:27,399
- There's a biscuit, too.
- - Yes, indeed.

59
00:04:27,934 --> 00:04:29,935
- Every time I see
that tree over there,

60
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:32,904
it reminds me of when
I was a little boy.

61
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:35,741
Me and my daddy, we
planted this little seed.

62
00:04:35,743 --> 00:04:38,443
It grew into something
really beautiful.

63
00:04:38,445 --> 00:04:40,712
That's how God is with us.

64
00:04:40,714 --> 00:04:45,250
He takes our family and
He rains down His love.

65
00:05:03,303 --> 00:05:04,903
- Daddy?

66
00:05:09,676 --> 00:05:11,576
Hey, Pop!

67
00:05:15,715 --> 00:05:17,282
Daddy.

68
00:06:08,634 --> 00:06:10,769
- He ain't here.

69
00:06:15,208 --> 00:06:17,809
We found him this morning...

70
00:06:18,711 --> 00:06:21,546
facedown in the creek.

71
00:06:29,389 --> 00:06:32,591
Ain't but a foot deep.

72
00:07:43,229 --> 00:07:48,266
- Matty, do you know
what happens in the woods

73
00:07:48,268 --> 00:07:51,670
when all the wolves die out?

74
00:07:52,205 --> 00:07:53,138
- No, I don't, Snake.

75
00:07:53,140 --> 00:07:56,608
- When they get hunted down...

76
00:07:57,176 --> 00:07:57,776
that's when they move in.

77
00:07:57,778 --> 00:08:01,780
- What are you
even talking about, Snake?

78
00:08:08,154 --> 00:08:10,121
- What about the store, Matty?

79
00:08:10,123 --> 00:08:13,525
First the store, then
what? The whole town?

80
00:08:13,527 --> 00:08:14,893
No.

81
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:19,030
I ain't gonna let them...

82
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:23,001
take our town.

83
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:30,108
That store was my daddy's store,

84
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:34,312
your daddy's store.

85
00:08:34,314 --> 00:08:35,847
- I know.

86
00:08:36,782 --> 00:08:39,217
Why does it have to be
anybody's store, Snake?

87
00:08:39,219 --> 00:08:40,418
Can't it just...

88
00:08:40,420 --> 00:08:42,754
Can't you just let it...

89
00:08:42,756 --> 00:08:44,122
Just let it be?

90
00:08:44,124 --> 00:08:46,958
- You always was soft.

91
00:08:48,561 --> 00:08:50,028
- Okay.

92
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:52,931
We're gonna to scare 'em well.

93
00:08:53,900 --> 00:08:57,536
Let's run them out of town
for good, Snake, me and you.

94
00:08:57,538 --> 00:08:58,803
The Cain brothers.

95
00:08:58,805 --> 00:09:01,373
Let's do it, let's do it!

96
00:09:02,676 --> 00:09:05,110
Let's do it, yeah!

97
00:09:12,885 --> 00:09:15,253
I ain't soft.

98
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:16,321
Snake!

99
00:09:16,323 --> 00:09:18,957
- Where are them kids?

100
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:21,459
- They was here somewhere.
- - I have no ide...

101
00:09:21,461 --> 00:09:22,494
- Check the closet.

102
00:09:22,496 --> 00:09:23,595
- Closet.

103
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:25,230
I know they're here somewhere.

104
00:09:25,232 --> 00:09:27,465
Mama Bear, did you
see those kids?

105
00:09:27,467 --> 00:09:28,667
- No!
- - Mama Bear!

106
00:09:28,669 --> 00:09:31,202
- No!
- - A-ha!

107
00:09:31,204 --> 00:09:33,305
I see 'em.

108
00:09:37,877 --> 00:09:39,611
Where are those kids?

109
00:09:39,613 --> 00:09:43,982
I'm gonna eat those kids.

110
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:46,585
- Uh-oh.
- I'm gonna get ya.

111
00:09:46,587 --> 00:09:48,186
- I'm gonna get ya.

112
00:09:48,188 --> 00:09:50,255
I'm gonna get ya.

113
00:09:56,195 --> 00:09:59,764
- Oh, babe. Come get into bed.

114
00:10:00,132 --> 00:10:02,767
Y'all know you can't
hide from Papa Bear.

115
00:10:02,769 --> 00:10:05,036
There you go, son.

116
00:10:06,672 --> 00:10:08,373
I love you, baby girl.

117
00:10:08,375 --> 00:10:10,842
- I love you, too, Daddy.

118
00:10:13,646 --> 00:10:15,380
- Michael.

119
00:10:15,382 --> 00:10:17,582
Don't I get a goodnight kiss?

120
00:10:17,584 --> 00:10:19,050
- Too old, Dad!

121
00:10:19,052 --> 00:10:20,518
- Too old?

122
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:23,455
How about an "I love you"?

123
00:10:23,457 --> 00:10:25,724
- Too old!

124
00:10:25,726 --> 00:10:27,158
- Well, I tell you what.

125
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:29,761
Tomorrow's opening
day for the store.

126
00:10:29,763 --> 00:10:32,530
I want my son to
be the first one

127
00:10:32,532 --> 00:10:35,400
to ring that bell so loud

128
00:10:35,402 --> 00:10:37,235
that the whole town will hear.

129
00:10:37,237 --> 00:10:39,204
- Really?!
- - Really.

130
00:10:39,206 --> 00:10:42,073
- All right!
- - All right.

131
00:10:42,075 --> 00:10:46,878
- Okay. You guys
get some sleep, okay?

132
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:48,513
- Dad?

133
00:10:48,515 --> 00:10:49,848
I love you.

134
00:10:49,850 --> 00:10:51,816
- I know, son.

135
00:10:52,618 --> 00:10:54,919
Love you guys.

136
00:10:55,721 --> 00:10:57,222
Night!

137
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:00,959
Mmm, Mama Bear!

138
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:03,695
Papa Bear wants some honey.

139
00:11:03,697 --> 00:11:06,865
- Come on then, Papa Bear.

140
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:09,401
- Come on, Jake!

141
00:11:09,403 --> 00:11:10,802
- Come on, Jake!

142
00:11:10,804 --> 00:11:13,271
- I'm comin', hold on.

143
00:11:15,875 --> 00:11:17,042
- Jake, where ya going?

144
00:11:17,044 --> 00:11:19,444
I made your favorite,
mashed potatoes and gravy!

145
00:11:19,446 --> 00:11:21,546
- I'm just going out with
the boys to get some beers.

146
00:11:21,548 --> 00:11:22,380
That's all. No harm.

147
00:11:22,382 --> 00:11:25,417
- When did you start
drinking again?

148
00:11:25,419 --> 00:11:27,318
- Come on!

149
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,422
- Who are those boys?

150
00:11:30,424 --> 00:11:31,189
- Snake and Matty.

151
00:11:31,191 --> 00:11:33,958
I met 'em at the
stables, hangin' around.

152
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,260
- Do they work there?

153
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:35,560
- No.

154
00:11:35,562 --> 00:11:38,530
Listen, Carrie. Just put
my food on the warmer.

155
00:11:38,532 --> 00:11:41,166
I'll be back later, all right?

156
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:43,368
Hey, their uncle is
Sheriff Joe Cain.

157
00:11:43,370 --> 00:11:45,470
I mean how much
trouble could I get in?

158
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:51,409
- Okay.

159
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:53,611
- I'll see you later!

160
00:11:53,613 --> 00:11:54,612
- I love you.

161
00:11:54,614 --> 00:11:55,947
- I know you do.

162
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:59,084
- Let me guess,
she made your favorite.

163
00:12:00,020 --> 00:12:04,389
You know, Jake, 50% of
marriages fail for a reason.

164
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:12,764
- Don't do nothing stupid now.

165
00:12:12,766 --> 00:12:15,567
- Just gonna scare 'em, Joe.

166
00:12:15,569 --> 00:12:17,035
That's it.

167
00:12:17,037 --> 00:12:20,338
- That's it.
- You got it, Joe.

168
00:12:20,340 --> 00:12:22,040
- You're gonna
go on a little ride

169
00:12:22,042 --> 00:12:24,542
with me and Matty here.

170
00:12:24,544 --> 00:12:26,377
- Sheriff.

171
00:12:32,852 --> 00:12:35,453
- Raise 'em up, boys.

172
00:12:39,592 --> 00:12:40,492
To the brotherhood.

173
00:12:40,494 --> 00:12:42,727
To the brotherhood.

174
00:12:42,729 --> 00:12:44,362
- Brotherhood.

175
00:12:50,669 --> 00:12:51,536
- Woo!

176
00:12:51,538 --> 00:12:54,873
- Ah!
- Burns.

177
00:12:56,509 --> 00:12:59,744
- You boys have fun, now.

178
00:13:08,120 --> 00:13:09,854
- You sure know
how to make a man

179
00:13:09,856 --> 00:13:11,689
feel good, Mama Bear.

180
00:13:13,493 --> 00:13:15,760
- I'm just proud of you.

181
00:13:15,762 --> 00:13:18,396
You been working so, so hard,

182
00:13:18,398 --> 00:13:21,299
for so long, on this one.

183
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:24,035
- Still a lot to do.

184
00:13:24,037 --> 00:13:26,938
Got a long way to go.

185
00:13:27,740 --> 00:13:31,109
- You sure you and Seth
know what you doing?

186
00:13:32,913 --> 00:13:36,981
- Well, we gonna be all right.

187
00:13:37,449 --> 00:13:38,983
If the store is successful,

188
00:13:38,985 --> 00:13:44,189
it can go a long way in
healing a lot of old wounds.

189
00:13:44,191 --> 00:13:45,924
Besides, honey.

190
00:13:45,926 --> 00:13:47,592
God done brought us this far.

191
00:13:47,594 --> 00:13:50,628
We can't turn around now.

192
00:13:54,300 --> 00:13:56,100
- Okay.

193
00:13:58,270 --> 00:14:00,805
You comin' in?

194
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:02,574
- I'll be in in a minute.

195
00:14:02,576 --> 00:14:05,677
- I trust you, Bob.
- Okay.

196
00:14:46,752 --> 00:14:48,286
- I know what you all up to.

197
00:14:48,288 --> 00:14:50,722
I don't want no trouble.
This is my property.

198
00:14:50,724 --> 00:14:52,624
Go on home, now.

199
00:14:52,626 --> 00:14:56,060
If you leave now, we'll just
act like this never happened.

200
00:14:56,062 --> 00:14:58,396
- I tell you what.

201
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,365
Kinda hoping you don't forget.

202
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,934
I don't think you're
understanding me.

203
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,505
The big picture,
we don't like you.

204
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:10,308
We don't want you here.

205
00:15:12,544 --> 00:15:14,379
- I don't care
whether you like me or not.

206
00:15:14,381 --> 00:15:16,481
What I do know,
this is my property!

207
00:15:16,483 --> 00:15:18,249
I'm not asking you,
I'm telling you!

208
00:15:18,251 --> 00:15:20,718
Now, get on outta here!

209
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,419
- Bob?

210
00:15:21,421 --> 00:15:24,222
- It's okay, Emma.
Just get on back inside.

211
00:15:24,224 --> 00:15:26,624
Go on. Get back inside.

212
00:15:26,626 --> 00:15:28,927
- Done gone and
made me real mad.

213
00:15:28,929 --> 00:15:31,362
- Shep, get 'em!

214
00:15:40,106 --> 00:15:41,472
- No!

215
00:15:44,244 --> 00:15:46,010
What're you doing?!

216
00:15:46,012 --> 00:15:49,013
- No, no, no, Jakey.

217
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:51,382
You're one of us. Remember?

218
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:54,018
The brotherhood.

219
00:15:54,253 --> 00:15:55,687
We gonna burn 'em.

220
00:15:55,689 --> 00:15:57,588
- Burn 'em?

221
00:15:57,957 --> 00:16:00,024
- Matty?
- - Yeah?

222
00:16:00,026 --> 00:16:02,460
- Light it up.

223
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,928
- Now?

224
00:16:04,196 --> 00:16:06,097
- Right now.

225
00:16:06,231 --> 00:16:09,167
- No, Matty! No!

226
00:16:11,303 --> 00:16:12,670
Matty, don't do it.

227
00:16:12,672 --> 00:16:13,404
- Fire works.

228
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:14,572
- Throw it on the porch.

229
00:16:14,574 --> 00:16:18,076
- No, Matty! Don't do it!

230
00:16:18,078 --> 00:16:20,144
He's got kids in there.

231
00:16:20,146 --> 00:16:22,347
- Get in the truck.

232
00:16:25,217 --> 00:16:27,085
Now!

233
00:17:47,232 --> 00:17:50,334
- Bob lost
his wife and two kids.

234
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:53,538
- Yeah, it's a real pity.

235
00:17:53,939 --> 00:17:57,208
- Doesn't look like an accident.

236
00:17:57,210 --> 00:17:57,775
- Of course, it was.

237
00:17:57,777 --> 00:18:00,545
- There's a
bottle on the porch.

238
00:18:00,547 --> 00:18:02,146
- Hey!

239
00:18:02,347 --> 00:18:05,083
It was an accident.

240
00:18:06,218 --> 00:18:08,152
- Sure.

241
00:18:10,255 --> 00:18:15,626
- How do we rise above
the ashes of such a loss?

242
00:18:15,628 --> 00:18:17,295
The loss of a good woman,

243
00:18:17,297 --> 00:18:20,665
and her two innocent children?

244
00:18:20,667 --> 00:18:24,302
This is an unthinkable pain.

245
00:18:24,304 --> 00:18:29,107
A pain that reaches to the
deepest recesses of our soul.

246
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:33,144
There are no human
words to console,

247
00:18:33,146 --> 00:18:37,281
but there is
comfort in His word.

248
00:18:37,283 --> 00:18:41,452
The word ministers to our soul,

249
00:18:41,454 --> 00:18:44,255
calms our spirit,

250
00:18:44,257 --> 00:18:45,990
brings new life into us,

251
00:18:45,992 --> 00:18:49,794
and gives us the
reason to live again.

252
00:18:49,796 --> 00:18:53,531
"Fear not, for I am with you."

253
00:18:53,533 --> 00:18:57,101
Isaiah 41:10.

254
00:19:24,998 --> 00:19:28,299
- The last thing
I said to my wife

255
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:30,601
was, "Trust in God."

256
00:19:33,273 --> 00:19:35,339
It was God that let this happen.

257
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,769
- I could use a little
help around the store today.

258
00:20:38,771 --> 00:20:41,138
- I plan on going fishing.

259
00:20:41,140 --> 00:20:43,341
- I'm going fishing, too.

260
00:20:43,343 --> 00:20:46,077
- Sit down, sweetie.

261
00:20:46,079 --> 00:20:47,878
- May I be excused?

262
00:20:47,880 --> 00:20:50,214
- You haven't
finished eating yet.

263
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:51,682
- Go.

264
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:53,517
- Yes, Ma.

265
00:20:53,519 --> 00:20:55,853
- Yeah, go.

266
00:20:57,489 --> 00:21:00,591
What? Tell.

267
00:21:01,226 --> 00:21:04,262
- You know I have nightmares.

268
00:21:04,264 --> 00:21:05,763
I do.

269
00:21:07,132 --> 00:21:11,636
I see that flaming
bottle in my sleep.

270
00:21:11,638 --> 00:21:12,903
Why Bob?

271
00:21:12,905 --> 00:21:14,605
- We can't change the past.

272
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,173
We have to move on.

273
00:21:16,175 --> 00:21:19,443
- You even know where he lives?

274
00:21:19,445 --> 00:21:21,879
- No, I don't.

275
00:21:22,347 --> 00:21:23,314
He wants it that way.

276
00:21:23,316 --> 00:21:25,016
- Is that what
you tell yourself?

277
00:21:25,018 --> 00:21:27,151
- You don't think
I want him to come back?

278
00:21:27,153 --> 00:21:30,021
You don't think I haven't tried?

279
00:21:30,023 --> 00:21:32,556
He hardly talks anymore.

280
00:21:32,558 --> 00:21:34,258
Not even to me.

281
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,826
He comes into the store,

282
00:21:35,828 --> 00:21:39,764
gets what he needs, and leaves.

283
00:21:40,299 --> 00:21:42,033
He's built a wall
around himself,

284
00:21:42,035 --> 00:21:45,136
and ain't nobody gonna
get through that.

285
00:21:45,138 --> 00:21:48,472
- Then, you've got
to keep trying.

286
00:21:55,547 --> 00:21:57,615
- Jake?

287
00:21:59,518 --> 00:22:00,885
Jake.

288
00:22:07,993 --> 00:22:10,828
You need to go home now, son.

289
00:22:27,145 --> 00:22:30,414
- It's early.
- - Yup.

290
00:22:30,916 --> 00:22:33,084
- You were out all night again.

291
00:22:33,086 --> 00:22:34,452
- I'm tired.

292
00:22:34,454 --> 00:22:36,687
- I am, too.

293
00:22:36,988 --> 00:22:40,358
- Yeah, well
I work all day long.

294
00:22:40,360 --> 00:22:42,059
- So do I.

295
00:22:42,061 --> 00:22:43,127
- Yeah, right.

296
00:22:43,129 --> 00:22:46,697
- What, you think I
just sit around all day?

297
00:22:48,567 --> 00:22:51,035
Can't be going out on the town,

298
00:22:51,037 --> 00:22:54,672
spending our money on drinking.

299
00:22:54,674 --> 00:22:57,475
- Yeah, our money.

300
00:22:57,477 --> 00:22:59,877
You mean, my money.

301
00:23:01,446 --> 00:23:03,347
I earned it.

302
00:23:03,548 --> 00:23:05,816
It's my money. I earn it.

303
00:23:05,818 --> 00:23:08,352
I'll do what I wanna do with it.

304
00:23:08,354 --> 00:23:10,087
You could get a job.

305
00:23:10,089 --> 00:23:11,889
You can go out
and pay the bills,

306
00:23:11,891 --> 00:23:15,359
and I'll stay home and
play with the kids.

307
00:23:15,894 --> 00:23:18,195
- You don't even know your kids.

308
00:23:47,025 --> 00:23:49,160
- That rabbit.

309
00:23:49,162 --> 00:23:50,961
If you'd have been there...

310
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:52,897
you would've caught that
rabbit, and I wouldn't have

311
00:23:52,899 --> 00:23:56,834
to waste time
throwing that knife.

312
00:23:59,404 --> 00:24:02,673
I do miss 'em though.

313
00:24:02,675 --> 00:24:05,042
I miss 'em, boy.

314
00:24:05,744 --> 00:24:09,647
Now, I'm out here by myself.
Ain't nobody but me and you.

315
00:24:09,649 --> 00:24:12,116
You my best friend now.

316
00:24:12,118 --> 00:24:14,819
You're my everything now.

317
00:24:15,587 --> 00:24:17,054
Yeah.

318
00:24:36,341 --> 00:24:40,511
- I got you!

319
00:24:59,364 --> 00:25:01,131
- Who's there?

320
00:25:10,375 --> 00:25:12,076
Man, am I hearing things?

321
00:25:12,078 --> 00:25:14,879
Huh?! What?!

322
00:25:14,881 --> 00:25:17,515
Hey, wait.

323
00:25:17,517 --> 00:25:18,682
Come back here!

324
00:25:18,684 --> 00:25:19,884
Come back here.

325
00:25:19,886 --> 00:25:21,752
I'm gonna get you!

326
00:25:21,754 --> 00:25:23,621
You can't get away from me!

327
00:25:23,623 --> 00:25:26,857
Come here!

328
00:25:28,360 --> 00:25:29,793
Think you can mess with me?

329
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:31,428
- Had your head spinning.

330
00:25:31,430 --> 00:25:33,531
- That was luck.

331
00:25:33,533 --> 00:25:36,000
Here, give me your hand.

332
00:25:37,435 --> 00:25:38,536
Now, if you don't mind,

333
00:25:38,538 --> 00:25:41,305
I have some fish to catch.

334
00:25:41,307 --> 00:25:43,207
- Wait. Where you going?

335
00:25:43,209 --> 00:25:45,910
Can't you tell me?

336
00:25:45,912 --> 00:25:46,744
- No.

337
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:48,445
- Is it a secret?

338
00:25:50,515 --> 00:25:51,715
Well, if you ain't
gonna tell me,

339
00:25:51,717 --> 00:25:54,251
then I'm just gonna follow you.

340
00:25:58,456 --> 00:25:59,723
- Here it is.

341
00:25:59,725 --> 00:26:03,761
The best fishing spot around.

342
00:26:03,763 --> 00:26:04,528
- Wow.

343
00:26:04,530 --> 00:26:06,263
I ain't never seen this.

344
00:26:06,265 --> 00:26:10,534
- You just have to know
the right path to follow.

345
00:26:10,536 --> 00:26:11,835
Come on.

346
00:26:15,140 --> 00:26:17,241
- Here, let me help.

347
00:26:17,243 --> 00:26:20,544
First, you need some real bait.

348
00:26:20,546 --> 00:26:22,880
Fresh from the soil.

349
00:26:24,549 --> 00:26:26,550
Deer jerky, take a
little pull of this

350
00:26:26,552 --> 00:26:28,185
to give it some extra muscle.

351
00:26:28,187 --> 00:26:31,755
- Wait, did you just pull
the worm and the deer jerky

352
00:26:31,757 --> 00:26:33,257
out of the same pocket?

353
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:36,827
- It looks cool when
you chew it, too.

354
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:43,233
- Did your dad teach
you how to cast a pole?

355
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:45,903
- I ain't got no daddy.

356
00:26:47,105 --> 00:26:49,039
- Maybe you could meet my dad.

357
00:26:49,041 --> 00:26:50,608
- I got something!
- You did?

358
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,209
- Bay, I
actually got something!

359
00:26:52,211 --> 00:26:54,311
- Hold onto it with two hands!

360
00:26:54,313 --> 00:26:55,813
- Help me! Help me!

361
00:26:55,815 --> 00:26:57,581
Grab it!

362
00:26:57,682 --> 00:26:59,350
Grab it! Grab it!

363
00:26:59,352 --> 00:27:01,251
- I got it.

364
00:27:01,653 --> 00:27:02,519
I got it. Oh!

365
00:27:02,521 --> 00:27:05,789
- Hey, hey!
- - We caught a fish!

366
00:27:05,791 --> 00:27:07,257
- It's slippery.

367
00:27:07,959 --> 00:27:12,129
- Well, duh, it's slippery.
It's been in the water.

368
00:27:12,131 --> 00:27:15,299
- High five!
Give me a high five!

369
00:27:22,641 --> 00:27:23,540
What do you see?

370
00:27:23,542 --> 00:27:25,242
- A Bigfoot and a dog.

371
00:27:25,244 --> 00:27:28,012
- Wait! What?!

372
00:27:28,680 --> 00:27:31,248
- Let me see!
- - Shh!

373
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:34,718
- We gotta go!

374
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:35,386
- Run!

375
00:27:35,388 --> 00:27:38,088
- Come on!
Let's get outta here!

376
00:27:38,090 --> 00:27:41,225
Hey, wanna do this
again after church?

377
00:27:41,227 --> 00:27:43,961
- Church?
- - Yeah!

378
00:27:44,729 --> 00:27:46,730
- Don't you go to church?

379
00:27:46,732 --> 00:27:48,799
- I've never been.

380
00:27:49,334 --> 00:27:52,803
- The church is on the
hill, off of Old Route 37,

381
00:27:52,805 --> 00:27:54,972
just past the fork in the road.

382
00:27:54,974 --> 00:27:55,974
You can't miss it.

383
00:27:55,975 --> 00:27:59,043
All you have to do
is just look up.

384
00:27:59,045 --> 00:28:03,380
- Okay, see ya then.
- - Okay, bye.

385
00:28:08,253 --> 00:28:11,288
- Mom says you went fishing.

386
00:28:11,290 --> 00:28:13,390
Bet you didn't catch nothin'.

387
00:28:13,392 --> 00:28:15,025
- Not much.

388
00:28:15,027 --> 00:28:17,161
- Not much?

389
00:28:44,622 --> 00:28:47,124
- What're you two up to?

390
00:28:47,826 --> 00:28:49,293
No good?

391
00:28:50,729 --> 00:28:52,963
- Thinkin' about it.

392
00:28:52,965 --> 00:28:54,698
- Sheriff.

393
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:58,068
I need to get your
signature on these reports.

394
00:28:59,370 --> 00:29:01,705
- You sign 'em.

395
00:29:02,040 --> 00:29:04,007
- Yes, sir.

396
00:29:04,409 --> 00:29:04,975
- Whatcha need?

397
00:29:04,977 --> 00:29:09,179
A little cash'd be good.

398
00:29:09,181 --> 00:29:14,585
- You boys ever
gonna settle down,

399
00:29:14,587 --> 00:29:16,787
find you a good woman,

400
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:18,188
maybe a job?

401
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,957
- Why?

402
00:29:21,025 --> 00:29:22,760
- You got me.

403
00:29:22,762 --> 00:29:25,963
Why work, when you can mooch?

404
00:29:26,464 --> 00:29:29,399
- Thank you, Uncle Joe.

405
00:29:32,170 --> 00:29:34,071
Hey, uhh...

406
00:29:34,372 --> 00:29:39,009
You ever hear anything else
about the older Collins brother?

407
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:42,880
- What older Collins brother?

408
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:16,613
- Hey, Pete.

409
00:30:16,615 --> 00:30:18,215
- Hey, Jake.
What're you drinking?

410
00:30:18,217 --> 00:30:20,951
- The usual.
- - You got it.

411
00:30:21,553 --> 00:30:23,620
- Where you been, Jake?

412
00:30:23,622 --> 00:30:25,255
Ain't seen you in a while.

413
00:30:25,257 --> 00:30:25,689
- That's five.

414
00:30:25,691 --> 00:30:29,359
- You're not too good
for us now, are you?

415
00:30:30,261 --> 00:30:31,128
- Thanks.

416
00:30:31,130 --> 00:30:32,563
- No, just not, you know?

417
00:30:32,565 --> 00:30:35,032
I been in a mood lately.

418
00:30:35,333 --> 00:30:38,068
- Wanna have a
little fun tonight?

419
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,237
Pop some coyotes?

420
00:30:40,805 --> 00:30:43,273
- Nah, not tonight.

421
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:48,445
- Gotta get that
fire outta your head, boy.

422
00:30:50,114 --> 00:30:52,816
It's been a while, now.

423
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:59,489
You startin' to make
me real nervous.

424
00:31:01,092 --> 00:31:03,327
I get a little crazy...

425
00:31:04,529 --> 00:31:06,997
when I get nervous.

426
00:31:13,771 --> 00:31:16,073
- A little crazy?

427
00:31:17,842 --> 00:31:20,978
Now, you know that man saw us.

428
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:29,219
- What I know...

429
00:31:29,988 --> 00:31:32,923
is that that old man...

430
00:31:33,091 --> 00:31:36,059
way off in the woods.

431
00:31:36,928 --> 00:31:38,262
Which is exactly

432
00:31:38,264 --> 00:31:41,999
where we want him.

433
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,310
Hey, Gibby!

434
00:31:53,678 --> 00:31:55,012
Deputy Gibby!

435
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:57,648
Be sure to tell this
fine, little lady here

436
00:31:57,650 --> 00:31:59,316
you ain't never kissed no girl.

437
00:31:59,318 --> 00:32:01,551
I mean you're law
man, after all.

438
00:32:01,553 --> 00:32:02,786
You should always
tell the truth.

439
00:32:02,788 --> 00:32:05,122
- Yeah, Snake. Whatever, okay?

440
00:32:05,124 --> 00:32:08,258
Well, you know I've got
my uniform in the car.

441
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,727
I can go put it
on and arrest you.

442
00:32:14,899 --> 00:32:18,602
- You catch yourself another
beatin' like you did last year.

443
00:32:18,604 --> 00:32:21,305
Keep runnin' that mouth.

444
00:32:21,307 --> 00:32:22,839
- Just...

445
00:32:22,841 --> 00:32:23,807
joking.

446
00:32:23,809 --> 00:32:26,176
- A joke.

447
00:32:35,887 --> 00:32:39,022
- Now, you know you ain't
the law around here.

448
00:32:39,024 --> 00:32:41,591
- Well, sure we are!

449
00:32:42,760 --> 00:32:45,295
Don't you forget that.

450
00:32:47,065 --> 00:32:50,067
Law around here...

451
00:32:52,603 --> 00:32:54,972
is what we make it.

452
00:33:09,687 --> 00:33:11,154
What is this, church?!

453
00:33:11,156 --> 00:33:13,724
Who wants to drink with
the brotherhood, huh?!

454
00:33:16,328 --> 00:33:18,595
Fill me up, Matty!

455
00:33:33,678 --> 00:33:35,846
- You been in your
head all morning, Jake.

456
00:33:35,848 --> 00:33:37,647
What's going on?

457
00:33:40,885 --> 00:33:42,252
- I'm good.

458
00:33:42,254 --> 00:33:44,755
- No. No, you're not.

459
00:33:44,757 --> 00:33:45,922
I've known you
long enough to know

460
00:33:45,924 --> 00:33:48,492
when something's
up, so what's up?

461
00:33:49,861 --> 00:33:51,661
- Thinking about leaving Carrie,

462
00:33:51,663 --> 00:33:53,997
moving onto another town.

463
00:33:53,999 --> 00:33:55,365
I don't know.

464
00:33:55,367 --> 00:33:58,101
Just wanna be by myself.

465
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:01,038
- What about the kids?

466
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,007
Your job? You just
can't run off.

467
00:34:05,343 --> 00:34:06,243
- Why not?

468
00:34:06,245 --> 00:34:08,979
I woke up this morning
doubting everything, Frank.

469
00:34:08,981 --> 00:34:11,381
I got two kids and a
wife I can't relate to.

470
00:34:11,383 --> 00:34:13,617
- Yeah, well no one
said marriage is easy.

471
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:16,019
You have to work at it.

472
00:34:16,387 --> 00:34:17,954
- I tried, Frank.

473
00:34:17,956 --> 00:34:18,789
I mean no offense.

474
00:34:18,791 --> 00:34:20,624
I'm thankful for the job
you've given me at the stable,

475
00:34:20,626 --> 00:34:23,393
but there's gotta
be something more.

476
00:34:23,395 --> 00:34:25,629
- It's an honest living.

477
00:34:25,963 --> 00:34:29,099
You're providing
for your family.

478
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:32,836
- Yeah, barely.

479
00:34:32,838 --> 00:34:35,939
- You know that
my wife gave up on me.

480
00:34:35,941 --> 00:34:37,541
Gave up on us.

481
00:34:37,842 --> 00:34:42,045
Thought there was something
better out there, I guess.

482
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:42,913
Long time, I blamed myself,

483
00:34:42,915 --> 00:34:46,917
but eventually I realized
it wasn't my fault.

484
00:34:46,919 --> 00:34:50,220
She just didn't wanna
be married anymore.

485
00:34:50,222 --> 00:34:53,890
She did the easy thing and
just gave up on the marriage.

486
00:34:53,892 --> 00:34:55,559
See, the problem with
doing that though

487
00:34:55,561 --> 00:34:59,596
is it creates a lot
of pain on both sides.

488
00:34:59,598 --> 00:35:01,198
Trust me.

489
00:35:01,332 --> 00:35:03,200
Think about this, Jake.

490
00:35:03,202 --> 00:35:04,935
Think about what you're doing.

491
00:35:04,937 --> 00:35:08,738
- Well, maybe people
ought not get married.

492
00:35:09,707 --> 00:35:12,576
- You know what you have?

493
00:35:12,977 --> 00:35:16,146
Beautiful wife,
beautiful kids...

494
00:35:17,148 --> 00:35:18,582
I want that.

495
00:35:18,916 --> 00:35:22,385
I'll probably never
have a child of my own.

496
00:35:22,387 --> 00:35:25,088
But I want what you have.

497
00:35:26,157 --> 00:35:28,024
- Thou shalt not covet.

498
00:35:28,026 --> 00:35:29,126
You just broke a commandment.

499
00:35:29,128 --> 00:35:32,596
- Yeah, I think you
know what I mean.

500
00:35:34,833 --> 00:35:36,800
- I'm sorry for throwing
all this on you, Frank.

501
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:39,002
- Then maybe you should
put those big-boy pants on

502
00:35:39,004 --> 00:35:41,104
and man up.

503
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:44,875
Be a father.

504
00:35:44,877 --> 00:35:46,576
Be a husband.

505
00:35:46,911 --> 00:35:50,847
It's family, Jake. It's
the greatest gift of all.

506
00:35:57,788 --> 00:36:00,123
- I'm done.

507
00:36:43,868 --> 00:36:46,269
- Lord, we bless your name.

508
00:36:46,271 --> 00:36:48,171
Hallelujah!

509
00:36:50,007 --> 00:36:50,974
Come on, put your hands together

510
00:36:50,976 --> 00:36:53,510
for our preacher,
Preacher Sam, come on!

511
00:36:53,512 --> 00:36:54,012
- Amen!

512
00:36:57,883 --> 00:36:59,683
What a wonderful God we have!

513
00:36:59,685 --> 00:37:03,220
This morning, my sermon comes
to you from the book of...

514
00:37:03,222 --> 00:37:04,788
- What're you doing here?

515
00:37:04,790 --> 00:37:07,290
- I figured I'd come try it out.

516
00:37:07,292 --> 00:37:08,525
- Who, among you,

517
00:37:08,527 --> 00:37:12,062
if he has 100 sheep,
and loses one of them,

518
00:37:12,064 --> 00:37:15,565
does not leave the
99 in the wasteland,

519
00:37:15,567 --> 00:37:19,035
and follow the last
one until he finds it?

520
00:37:19,037 --> 00:37:23,006
There will likewise be
more rejoicing in heaven

521
00:37:23,008 --> 00:37:25,308
over the repentance
of one sinner,

522
00:37:25,310 --> 00:37:28,411
than over 99 righteous people

523
00:37:28,413 --> 00:37:31,214
who have no need to repent.

524
00:37:31,216 --> 00:37:35,285
- Amen!
- - Amen!

525
00:37:36,887 --> 00:37:39,289
- When those Cain
boys gonna repent?

526
00:37:39,291 --> 00:37:41,391
- We let the law do its job.

527
00:37:41,393 --> 00:37:42,792
- Preacher, that
sheriff ain't done nothin'

528
00:37:42,794 --> 00:37:45,362
about what happened
to that man's family.

529
00:37:45,364 --> 00:37:46,630
- We put our trust in God.

530
00:37:46,632 --> 00:37:49,165
We don't follow man's
law, we follow God's law.

531
00:37:49,167 --> 00:37:54,704
Amen, let the church say amen.

532
00:37:56,407 --> 00:37:57,707
- You did pretty good up there.

533
00:37:57,709 --> 00:38:00,343
- Oh, I get a little
happy, if you know what I mean.

534
00:38:00,345 --> 00:38:02,078
Preacher Sam,
pleased to meet you.

535
00:38:02,080 --> 00:38:03,480
- Hey, Preacher Sam.

536
00:38:03,482 --> 00:38:05,015
- Who are the Cain brothers?

537
00:38:05,017 --> 00:38:08,518
- They're a couple of
boys needing prayers.

538
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:09,986
- Let's go, Puck.

539
00:38:09,988 --> 00:38:11,321
- Nice meeting
you, Preacher Sam.

540
00:38:11,323 --> 00:38:12,522
- Nice meeting you, too.

541
00:38:12,524 --> 00:38:13,723
- Come on, let's go!

542
00:38:13,725 --> 00:38:15,659
- Okay!

543
00:38:25,436 --> 00:38:26,136
- Stick 'em up!

544
00:38:26,138 --> 00:38:28,204
- You scared the
crawdads outta me, Bay!

545
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:30,707
Don't do that!

546
00:38:30,709 --> 00:38:33,009
- Now, we're even.

547
00:38:33,011 --> 00:38:34,277
You seen anything?

548
00:38:34,279 --> 00:38:35,312
- Ain't seen nothin' yet.

549
00:38:35,314 --> 00:38:37,547
Old man's been
sleeping on his porch.

550
00:38:37,549 --> 00:38:40,317
Seems like forever.

551
00:38:40,818 --> 00:38:43,953
- You'd think he'd be
thirsty, or hungry...

552
00:38:43,955 --> 00:38:45,855
- Hasn't moved a muscle.

553
00:38:45,857 --> 00:38:48,358
I just don't get how he could
stay still for that long.

554
00:38:48,360 --> 00:38:50,060
- I could stay still forever.

555
00:38:50,062 --> 00:38:53,463
- Pff, sure.
- - Yeah.

556
00:38:53,465 --> 00:38:54,431
- Get off, Bay.

557
00:38:54,433 --> 00:38:56,132
- What're you talking about?

558
00:38:56,134 --> 00:38:57,667
- Get your hands off of me!

559
00:38:57,669 --> 00:38:59,602
- What're you talking about?

560
00:38:59,604 --> 00:39:01,571
Get your hands off...

561
00:39:01,573 --> 00:39:03,173
Uncle Bob?

562
00:39:03,175 --> 00:39:03,907
- Come on.

563
00:39:03,909 --> 00:39:05,975
- Oh, we're so busted.

564
00:39:05,977 --> 00:39:08,445
- You know better, Bay.

565
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:15,151
- Oh, no. No
wonder he didn't move.

566
00:39:15,153 --> 00:39:17,854
- Here. Sit down.

567
00:39:19,390 --> 00:39:19,890
- Yes, Sir.

568
00:39:19,891 --> 00:39:21,658
- You wanna tell me why you two

569
00:39:21,660 --> 00:39:23,526
been snoopin'
around my property?

570
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:27,864
Trespassing is against the
law. You know that, don't you?

571
00:39:32,670 --> 00:39:35,338
- I wouldn't mind being
that scarecrow right now.

572
00:39:35,340 --> 00:39:36,439
- It was her idea.

573
00:39:36,441 --> 00:39:38,375
I just wanted to go home.

574
00:39:38,377 --> 00:39:39,042
- What?!

575
00:39:39,044 --> 00:39:39,943
You know you wanted
to check him out!

576
00:39:39,945 --> 00:39:42,078
You said he was some sort
of Bigfoot or something.

577
00:39:42,080 --> 00:39:43,279
- Did not!
- - Did so!

578
00:39:43,281 --> 00:39:45,915
- I did not!

579
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:49,285
You.

580
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:51,955
You have some real
neat stuff, Uncle Bob.

581
00:39:51,957 --> 00:39:53,289
Did you make all this?!

582
00:39:53,291 --> 00:39:55,024
- Yeah, it's all pretty cool.

583
00:39:55,026 --> 00:39:58,661
Wish I could make
stuff like this.

584
00:39:58,663 --> 00:40:01,064
- Come on, Puck.

585
00:40:02,233 --> 00:40:04,567
- Yeah. I made 'em.

586
00:40:04,569 --> 00:40:10,306
- The other day, I was looking
at a picture on your mantle.

587
00:40:10,308 --> 00:40:12,475
Is that your family?

588
00:40:24,622 --> 00:40:26,623
I'm Puck.

589
00:40:31,429 --> 00:40:34,063
What's your dog's name?

590
00:40:34,999 --> 00:40:36,800
- Shep.

591
00:40:37,168 --> 00:40:40,003
- Cool, I like that name.

592
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:42,939
Come on, Bay.

593
00:40:43,474 --> 00:40:46,409
- Bye, Uncle Bob.

594
00:40:47,778 --> 00:40:49,679
- Every time I see
that tree over there,

595
00:40:49,681 --> 00:40:52,182
it reminds me of when
I was a little boy,

596
00:40:52,184 --> 00:40:54,918
and me and my daddy, we
planted this little seed

597
00:40:54,920 --> 00:40:58,021
that grew into something
really beautiful.

598
00:40:58,023 --> 00:41:00,290
That's how God is with us.

599
00:41:00,292 --> 00:41:04,427
He takes our family, and
He rains down his love,

600
00:41:04,429 --> 00:41:08,465
and we become all
that we can be.

601
00:41:17,943 --> 00:41:19,542
- Bob?

602
00:41:19,544 --> 00:41:20,677
- I love you, too, Daddy.

603
00:41:20,679 --> 00:41:22,045
- Dad, I love you.

604
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:24,347
- I know, son. Love you guys.

605
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:39,162
- I trust you, Bob.

606
00:41:52,710 --> 00:41:54,577
- What you doing, son?

607
00:41:54,579 --> 00:41:55,945
- Changing the battery,

608
00:41:55,947 --> 00:41:58,381
but I wanna check the oil first.

609
00:41:58,383 --> 00:41:59,682
- Yeah?

610
00:41:59,684 --> 00:42:02,986
All right, well I don't have
to be at work for a while.

611
00:42:02,988 --> 00:42:04,387
Would you like to go for a walk?

612
00:42:04,389 --> 00:42:06,422
- I'll go when you get back.

613
00:42:06,424 --> 00:42:07,490
It's just a battery.

614
00:42:07,492 --> 00:42:09,726
- It's just a
battery. Looks good.

615
00:42:09,728 --> 00:42:13,663
Sounds good. All right,
I'll see you in a bit.

616
00:42:14,765 --> 00:42:16,900
- Want some lemonade?

617
00:42:17,601 --> 00:42:18,835
- Yeah.

618
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,876
- Hello?

619
00:42:35,452 --> 00:42:36,953
- Hey, Bob.

620
00:42:36,955 --> 00:42:38,755
I, uhh...

621
00:42:39,356 --> 00:42:41,224
got your things.

622
00:42:48,432 --> 00:42:50,800
Salt, sugar, cereal,

623
00:42:50,802 --> 00:42:53,303
toothpaste, and

624
00:42:53,305 --> 00:42:55,038
toilet paper.

625
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:01,110
It's good to see you, Bob.

626
00:43:07,384 --> 00:43:10,720
Man, these are beautiful.

627
00:43:11,422 --> 00:43:13,056
Even trade?

628
00:43:13,058 --> 00:43:14,657
- Even.

629
00:43:19,096 --> 00:43:22,265
- I know how you
like your licorice.

630
00:43:51,128 --> 00:43:52,996
Hey, Bob?

631
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:58,301
The preacher gave a
good sermon today...

632
00:43:59,403 --> 00:44:00,937
on forgiveness.

633
00:44:22,493 --> 00:44:24,994
- All right, that's good.

634
00:44:30,034 --> 00:44:32,168
Here you go, boy.

635
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:44,447
Most of us start work first
thing in the morning, Jake.

636
00:44:44,449 --> 00:44:45,982
Not last.

637
00:44:47,785 --> 00:44:50,019
- I'm sorry, Frank.

638
00:44:50,021 --> 00:44:52,655
- Just get to work.

639
00:45:07,504 --> 00:45:09,439
- Jakey!

640
00:45:09,441 --> 00:45:12,041
You ready for a big one tonight?

641
00:45:13,811 --> 00:45:16,679
- I'm working overtime tonight.

642
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:20,783
- Come on, now.
Bang, bang, bang.

643
00:45:20,785 --> 00:45:23,019
Don't you love me no more?

644
00:45:23,021 --> 00:45:25,488
- Just got stuff
I gotta figure out.

645
00:45:25,490 --> 00:45:27,290
- What you
got to work out, Jake?

646
00:45:27,292 --> 00:45:31,127
What, another way to
smash on them horseshoe?

647
00:45:31,129 --> 00:45:35,164
Now, you ain't been much
of a team player lately.

648
00:45:35,166 --> 00:45:37,734
Seems like you've
got it in your head

649
00:45:37,736 --> 00:45:40,403
that you different somehow.

650
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:42,905
You're just like us.

651
00:45:44,274 --> 00:45:46,809
- I ain't nothin' like you.

652
00:45:46,811 --> 00:45:48,010
- Fine.

653
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:52,148
- I'm going over to Bob Collins.

654
00:45:52,150 --> 00:45:55,251
- No, no, no. See, you ain't.

655
00:45:56,053 --> 00:45:59,822
For one, Jake, you
ain't got the stones.

656
00:45:59,824 --> 00:46:01,023
Two...

657
00:46:01,625 --> 00:46:03,993
I'll just stop you.

658
00:46:03,995 --> 00:46:06,195
- You just try it.

659
00:46:16,374 --> 00:46:17,273
- Break it up!

660
00:46:17,275 --> 00:46:20,510
I said break it up!

661
00:46:25,983 --> 00:46:28,618
- Big boy thinks he can
throw punches around.

662
00:46:28,620 --> 00:46:31,320
- Shut your mouth, boy.

663
00:46:34,458 --> 00:46:36,926
You been drinking, Jake?

664
00:46:37,227 --> 00:46:40,863
Just go on home. You
know better than that.

665
00:46:40,865 --> 00:46:41,464
- I need the money, Frank.

666
00:46:41,466 --> 00:46:43,399
- If you need the
money, you won't come to work

667
00:46:43,401 --> 00:46:46,369
drinking tomorrow, now will you?

668
00:46:51,942 --> 00:46:53,810
You, and your brother,
and that so-called sheriff

669
00:46:53,812 --> 00:46:57,079
think you got this
town wrapped up.

670
00:46:57,081 --> 00:46:58,481
I can't speak for
everyone else around here

671
00:46:58,483 --> 00:47:02,018
because they're too
afraid to speak up.

672
00:47:02,020 --> 00:47:05,855
But, you boys are no good.

673
00:47:05,857 --> 00:47:08,424
- See ya around, hero.

674
00:47:09,693 --> 00:47:10,660
- You do know that,
in the State of Texas,

675
00:47:10,662 --> 00:47:14,397
if you trespass, that's
grounds for getting shot?

676
00:47:15,232 --> 00:47:18,201
I keep my rifle
loaded all day long.

677
00:47:18,203 --> 00:47:21,103
I see you coming
around here again,

678
00:47:21,105 --> 00:47:23,105
I just might mistake
you for a coyote

679
00:47:23,107 --> 00:47:24,974
trying to steal my chickens.

680
00:47:25,844 --> 00:47:28,511
You think that's funny?

681
00:47:29,012 --> 00:47:33,749
I guess we'll just have to
see what happens, won't we?

682
00:47:33,751 --> 00:47:36,285
Now get off my land.

683
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:41,057
- Sure, hoss.

684
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:44,560
Whatever you say.

685
00:48:01,045 --> 00:48:02,345
- Hello?

686
00:48:02,347 --> 00:48:03,412
- Hey, Carrie.

687
00:48:03,414 --> 00:48:04,747
- Hi, Frank, how are you?

688
00:48:04,749 --> 00:48:07,383
- Oh, I'm fine. It's just...

689
00:48:07,385 --> 00:48:10,486
Look, I had to send Jake home.

690
00:48:10,488 --> 00:48:12,622
I lost my temper a bit.

691
00:48:12,624 --> 00:48:17,093
He got in a scuffle with
one of the Cain brothers.

692
00:48:18,362 --> 00:48:21,130
Jake's been drinking again, too.

693
00:48:21,132 --> 00:48:22,899
- Oh.

694
00:48:23,834 --> 00:48:27,637
If you need anything,
I'll help if I can.

695
00:48:27,639 --> 00:48:30,640
- Okay. Thanks, Frank.

696
00:49:01,772 --> 00:49:03,239
- Where were you?

697
00:49:03,241 --> 00:49:04,840
- Work.

698
00:49:04,842 --> 00:49:06,108
- Got in a fight, huh?

699
00:49:06,110 --> 00:49:09,278
- Yeah, I got in a fight.

700
00:49:09,280 --> 00:49:11,681
- Frank called

701
00:49:11,683 --> 00:49:13,115
to check on you.

702
00:49:13,117 --> 00:49:16,285
The electricity was
turned off last night.

703
00:49:16,287 --> 00:49:18,187
- Well, I paid it.

704
00:49:18,189 --> 00:49:20,990
- Well, obviously you didn't!

705
00:49:22,693 --> 00:49:24,694
- Would you two stop yelling?

706
00:49:24,696 --> 00:49:28,030
- Don't talk to your
daddy like that, please.

707
00:49:29,299 --> 00:49:32,034
- I ain't got no daddy.

708
00:49:34,237 --> 00:49:37,440
Daddy, what is a daddy?!

709
00:49:37,442 --> 00:49:39,775
- You listen to your
mom, and you be quiet.

710
00:49:39,777 --> 00:49:41,210
- I don't wanna be quiet.

711
00:49:41,212 --> 00:49:43,245
All you do is yell and scream!

712
00:49:43,247 --> 00:49:47,216
Why can't I, huh?!

713
00:49:49,953 --> 00:49:53,990
- Get out! Get out!

714
00:49:53,992 --> 00:49:54,757
Get out!

715
00:49:54,759 --> 00:49:57,159
Leave! Get out of here!

716
00:49:57,161 --> 00:49:58,327
Get out of here!

717
00:49:58,329 --> 00:49:59,695
Goodbye.

718
00:49:59,697 --> 00:50:03,032
Puck. Puck.

719
00:50:03,367 --> 00:50:06,135
Puck! Puck!

720
00:50:06,436 --> 00:50:07,670
Puck!

721
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:10,973
Puck! Puck!

722
00:50:12,743 --> 00:50:15,878
Puck!

723
00:50:19,916 --> 00:50:21,617
- Ooh! Ah!

724
00:50:21,619 --> 00:50:23,619
That blanket is stinky!

725
00:50:23,621 --> 00:50:28,290
My, I can't see how you can
stand to lay on that thing.

726
00:50:28,292 --> 00:50:28,591
Well...

727
00:50:28,593 --> 00:50:32,361
gonna get a wash today, 'cause
I can't stand it anymore.

728
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:36,665
That is disgusting! My!

729
00:50:40,337 --> 00:50:44,140
All right. There we go.

730
00:50:44,508 --> 00:50:46,042
All right, now.

731
00:50:46,044 --> 00:50:47,309
No! No, no, no!

732
00:50:47,311 --> 00:50:49,111
Shep, come on now!

733
00:50:49,113 --> 00:50:49,812
Come on, move!

734
00:50:49,814 --> 00:50:51,313
No, let it...

735
00:50:51,315 --> 00:50:52,275
Shep! Let it go.

736
00:50:53,451 --> 00:50:57,386
Let it go! Shep,
will you let it go?!

737
00:50:57,388 --> 00:50:59,622
Just take it. Take it!

738
00:50:59,624 --> 00:51:01,057
Take it!

739
00:51:02,492 --> 00:51:03,859
- Puck?

740
00:51:03,861 --> 00:51:05,094
Puck, it's me, Bay.

741
00:51:05,096 --> 00:51:06,328
- Just leave me alone.

742
00:51:06,330 --> 00:51:07,763
- What's the matter?

743
00:51:07,765 --> 00:51:10,566
- Nothing, I'm fine.

744
00:51:10,867 --> 00:51:14,236
- No, you're not, or
you wouldn't be crying.

745
00:51:14,238 --> 00:51:16,505
- I ain't crying.

746
00:51:17,174 --> 00:51:19,708
- Look at me, Puck.

747
00:51:21,545 --> 00:51:22,812
What happened?!

748
00:51:22,814 --> 00:51:25,581
- I busted my lip on a rock.

749
00:51:26,216 --> 00:51:29,118
- Somebody hit you, didn't they?

750
00:51:31,822 --> 00:51:33,656
- My daddy hit me.

751
00:51:33,658 --> 00:51:36,859
He was all drunk, so
I guess it's okay.

752
00:51:36,861 --> 00:51:40,229
He don't smack me
when he ain't drunk.

753
00:51:41,965 --> 00:51:43,799
- He shouldn't be
hitting you, Puck.

754
00:51:43,801 --> 00:51:48,270
Drinking or not, that
just isn't right.

755
00:51:48,272 --> 00:51:50,539
- That's just Jake.

756
00:51:52,909 --> 00:51:55,211
- You have to tell
someone, Puck.

757
00:51:55,213 --> 00:51:56,912
- Who am I going to tell?

758
00:51:56,914 --> 00:52:00,149
Besides, ain't no
one to listen anyway.

759
00:52:00,151 --> 00:52:02,418
- How about telling my dad?

760
00:52:02,420 --> 00:52:05,654
He'll listen to you, Puck.

761
00:52:06,356 --> 00:52:08,457
- I'll be okay.

762
00:52:10,293 --> 00:52:11,794
- Come on.

763
00:52:13,497 --> 00:52:14,530
Come on, Puck.

764
00:52:14,532 --> 00:52:16,432
- Mm-mmm.

765
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,101
- Come on.

766
00:52:19,569 --> 00:52:21,704
Come on.

767
00:52:32,115 --> 00:52:33,182
- Hey, son.

768
00:52:33,184 --> 00:52:34,550
- Hey, Dad.

769
00:52:34,651 --> 00:52:37,019
- Hey, grab a seat. Move that
stuff outta the way there.

770
00:52:37,021 --> 00:52:40,556
- Okay, Dad.
- Be right with you.

771
00:52:42,392 --> 00:52:44,026
- What's going on, son?

772
00:52:44,028 --> 00:52:46,529
- Dad, this is my
new friend, Puck.

773
00:52:46,531 --> 00:52:48,497
She got hurt.

774
00:52:49,132 --> 00:52:51,600
- Ah, you got hurt?

775
00:52:53,470 --> 00:52:55,437
Let me see.

776
00:52:55,539 --> 00:52:57,373
Well, well, well.

777
00:52:57,375 --> 00:53:00,442
You know, I think I
have just the thing

778
00:53:00,444 --> 00:53:03,078
that'll fix you right up.

779
00:53:03,080 --> 00:53:07,716
I told you he was nice.

780
00:53:09,753 --> 00:53:12,254
- Fresh strawberries.

781
00:53:12,956 --> 00:53:16,492
Go ahead. Take one.

782
00:53:20,230 --> 00:53:22,631
Tell me what you think.

783
00:53:23,066 --> 00:53:23,799
- Yeah?
- - I'll take one.

784
00:53:23,801 --> 00:53:27,036
- I know you will take one.

785
00:53:27,038 --> 00:53:27,970
- Thank you.

786
00:53:27,972 --> 00:53:29,872
- You're very welcome.

787
00:53:29,874 --> 00:53:31,707
Ah, there's that smile.

788
00:53:31,709 --> 00:53:33,842
- Well, we'll be going, Papa.

789
00:53:33,844 --> 00:53:35,477
- All right.

790
00:53:35,479 --> 00:53:36,712
Where you off to?

791
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:37,913
- Fishing.

792
00:53:37,915 --> 00:53:39,915
- Of course. Fishing.

793
00:53:39,917 --> 00:53:41,684
Come here, you.

794
00:53:41,686 --> 00:53:42,785
- Come on, Puck.

795
00:53:42,787 --> 00:53:45,521
- Hey, Puck.
- - Yeah?

796
00:53:45,523 --> 00:53:49,124
- Why don't you
take these with you?

797
00:53:49,126 --> 00:53:50,492
- Thank you.

798
00:53:50,494 --> 00:53:52,361
- Ooh, yeah. More strawberries.

799
00:53:52,363 --> 00:53:55,397
- Give some to
your mom! I love you, son.

800
00:53:55,399 --> 00:53:57,099
- Love you, too, Dad.

801
00:53:57,101 --> 00:54:00,402
- Bye.

802
00:54:03,006 --> 00:54:04,840
- Well, Mr. Billy,

803
00:54:04,842 --> 00:54:09,545
another satisfied customer.

804
00:54:18,021 --> 00:54:19,855
- There he goes.

805
00:54:30,367 --> 00:54:32,468
- Where we going, Snake?

806
00:54:32,470 --> 00:54:34,937
- Come on, Jake.

807
00:54:49,452 --> 00:54:51,253
- All right, Snake.

808
00:54:51,255 --> 00:54:52,588
Comin' up on me.

809
00:55:02,532 --> 00:55:04,700
- There you go, Jake.

810
00:55:04,702 --> 00:55:07,036
We just gonna play a
little game of chicken.

811
00:55:11,541 --> 00:55:14,443
- Come on, Snake! Floor it!

812
00:55:15,646 --> 00:55:17,546
Cut him off!

813
00:55:19,416 --> 00:55:20,749
Yes!

814
00:55:23,053 --> 00:55:25,721
- We gonna circle around.

815
00:56:06,896 --> 00:56:08,764
- Jakey!

816
00:56:09,065 --> 00:56:12,468
How about that brotherhood now?

817
00:56:13,069 --> 00:56:15,404
- Ain't no brotherhood...

818
00:56:15,705 --> 00:56:19,708
with you or your
crazy, law man uncle.

819
00:56:27,951 --> 00:56:28,550
What?

820
00:56:28,552 --> 00:56:30,619
You think 'cause you got a job,

821
00:56:30,621 --> 00:56:32,855
and you earn a paycheck,

822
00:56:32,857 --> 00:56:35,424
you're some kind of role model?

823
00:56:35,426 --> 00:56:37,626
You're a liar, Joe.

824
00:56:37,628 --> 00:56:41,463
A 10-star-wearin' liar.

825
00:56:41,998 --> 00:56:43,999
You know what they did.

826
00:56:44,001 --> 00:56:45,868
Covering it up like
a hole in a wall.

827
00:56:45,870 --> 00:56:50,139
- Now, don't you be talking
to my family like that, boy.

828
00:56:50,141 --> 00:56:54,176
- I know what's
behind that wall.

829
00:56:54,178 --> 00:56:56,712
Them cries from them kids.

830
00:56:56,714 --> 00:56:59,515
That poor man's wife.

831
00:56:59,616 --> 00:57:02,651
They didn't do nothing to you.

832
00:57:05,221 --> 00:57:08,524
Them cries are coming to get ya,

833
00:57:09,125 --> 00:57:11,126
all three of you.

834
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:15,097
You just wait.

835
00:57:19,402 --> 00:57:22,771
- Why don't you
boys hit the road?

836
00:57:26,609 --> 00:57:28,410
Beat it!

837
00:57:53,069 --> 00:57:55,170
You know something, Jake?

838
00:57:56,039 --> 00:57:58,407
I could come up with about
a dozen legal reasons

839
00:57:58,409 --> 00:58:01,910
to put a bullet through
your head right now.

840
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:11,787
But, lucky for me,

841
00:58:11,789 --> 00:58:14,089
I only need one.

842
00:58:19,696 --> 00:58:21,063
- Sheriff?

843
00:58:21,065 --> 00:58:23,065
Everything all right?

844
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:26,034
- Just fine.

845
00:58:32,542 --> 00:58:34,810
Get this cleaned up.

846
00:58:43,319 --> 00:58:45,687
- Tell you what, you
be sure and tell your mom

847
00:58:45,689 --> 00:58:48,156
I said hello, and have her
stop by the shop, okay?

848
00:58:48,158 --> 00:58:50,192
- Okay.
- James? You do the...

849
00:58:50,194 --> 00:58:51,994
- Ow!

850
00:58:51,996 --> 00:58:54,129
You do the same. Tell
your dad I said hi.

851
00:58:54,131 --> 00:58:56,098
- Okay.
- - Bye-bye, now.

852
00:58:56,100 --> 00:58:58,133
- Can we go get some ice cream?

853
00:58:58,135 --> 00:58:59,101
- What you doing, Carl?

854
00:58:59,103 --> 00:59:01,436
- Hey, Seth.
How you doing, bro?

855
00:59:01,438 --> 00:59:03,539
- Licorice?
- - For me?

856
00:59:03,541 --> 00:59:04,373
- Hell yeah.

857
00:59:04,375 --> 00:59:06,742
- Licorice. Don't mind if I do.

858
00:59:09,512 --> 00:59:10,212
Thanks, bro.

859
00:59:10,214 --> 00:59:11,580
- Come on by tonight, Carl.

860
00:59:11,582 --> 00:59:14,750
Your sister's cooking
your favorite.

861
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:41,143
- I remember a picture
on this wall, right here,

862
00:59:41,145 --> 00:59:44,780
of me and my daddy
holding a big, old fish.

863
00:59:47,350 --> 00:59:49,217
Right over here,

864
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:53,021
was a picture of my daddy
winning the gun show.

865
00:59:53,023 --> 00:59:55,791
Good times, huh?

866
00:59:59,862 --> 01:00:04,099
I believe I'll have me some
of this black licorice.

867
01:00:05,902 --> 01:00:08,870
One of them carvings, too.

868
01:00:12,742 --> 01:00:15,277
Who makes these anyway?

869
01:00:16,713 --> 01:00:19,081
- My brother, Bob.

870
01:00:20,783 --> 01:00:23,585
- Didn't know you had a brother.

871
01:00:25,688 --> 01:00:27,789
- Yeah, you did.

872
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:31,893
You murdered his
wife and two kids.

873
01:00:33,496 --> 01:00:35,964
That'll be $4.78.

874
01:01:09,332 --> 01:01:12,734
- Thanks for the licorice.

875
01:01:22,812 --> 01:01:24,179
- Sheriff.

876
01:01:24,514 --> 01:01:27,349
I can't have your little
nephews come into my store

877
01:01:27,351 --> 01:01:28,417
and stealing from me.

878
01:01:28,419 --> 01:01:31,319
- Who? Snake and Matty?

879
01:01:31,321 --> 01:01:31,853
They ain't no harm.

880
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:33,822
- You mean like the
no harm they did

881
01:01:33,824 --> 01:01:37,025
to my brother and his family?

882
01:01:38,261 --> 01:01:39,795
- Oh.

883
01:01:39,797 --> 01:01:41,263
The accident.

884
01:01:41,597 --> 01:01:44,766
- We ain't calling
that no accident.

885
01:01:46,803 --> 01:01:50,472
- Well, seems to me

886
01:01:50,474 --> 01:01:52,974
you're gonna have to.

887
01:01:53,276 --> 01:01:55,610
Now, that happened months ago.

888
01:01:55,612 --> 01:01:59,381
People have left
alone what should be.

889
01:01:59,383 --> 01:02:02,551
If you wanna go starting
that all up again,

890
01:02:02,553 --> 01:02:04,786
you be my guest.

891
01:02:04,921 --> 01:02:07,622
But, you know those boys.

892
01:02:07,624 --> 01:02:09,925
You start something,

893
01:02:10,226 --> 01:02:12,594
I might have to
look the other way.

894
01:02:12,596 --> 01:02:13,995
- Yeah.

895
01:02:13,997 --> 01:02:17,065
You're real good at that,
aren't you, Sheriff?

896
01:02:17,067 --> 01:02:20,969
- You got a
real nice store there.

897
01:02:20,971 --> 01:02:23,071
Nice families.

898
01:02:27,276 --> 01:02:28,376
You 'bout done here, boys,

899
01:02:28,378 --> 01:02:32,748
'cause I'm getting hungry.

900
01:02:33,583 --> 01:02:35,450
- Me too.

901
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:53,502
- Mr. Knight,
you're gonna be fine, sir.

902
01:02:53,504 --> 01:02:58,273
You've been transported to
USMD Hospital at Arlington.

903
01:02:58,275 --> 01:02:59,574
You were in a car accident,

904
01:02:59,576 --> 01:03:02,410
and you hit your
head pretty hard.

905
01:03:02,412 --> 01:03:03,478
Just try to relax.

906
01:03:03,480 --> 01:03:07,649
Let me go get some pain
medicine and some ice chips.

907
01:03:07,651 --> 01:03:09,951
- Thank you.

908
01:03:46,022 --> 01:03:47,589
- Some pretty nice strawberries

909
01:03:47,591 --> 01:03:49,958
in the kitchen there.

910
01:03:53,896 --> 01:03:57,232
Honey, I'm so sorry.

911
01:03:57,867 --> 01:04:00,302
I love you so much.

912
01:04:00,304 --> 01:04:03,271
- I know, Mom. I love you, too.

913
01:04:03,273 --> 01:04:05,507
- Your daddy,
he loves you, too.

914
01:04:05,509 --> 01:04:07,742
He's just having a hard time.

915
01:04:07,744 --> 01:04:09,044
- It's okay.

916
01:04:09,378 --> 01:04:12,681
My new friend, Bay, took
me to see his dad's store.

917
01:04:12,683 --> 01:04:14,449
He has everything in there.

918
01:04:14,451 --> 01:04:18,286
That's where I got
strawberries from.

919
01:04:18,288 --> 01:04:20,856
He said we could
come by any time.

920
01:04:20,858 --> 01:04:24,159
- I think
that'd be a great idea.

921
01:04:25,194 --> 01:04:26,862
We're gonna be okay.

922
01:04:26,864 --> 01:04:28,263
Okay?

923
01:04:32,002 --> 01:04:34,402
Hold on, I'll be right back.

924
01:04:40,743 --> 01:04:41,376
Hello?

925
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:43,011
- Carrie, it's Frank.

926
01:04:43,013 --> 01:04:44,913
- Hi, Frank.

927
01:04:45,314 --> 01:04:47,215
- Jake's been in a car accident.

928
01:04:47,217 --> 01:04:48,483
- Where is he?

929
01:04:48,485 --> 01:04:49,885
- USMD.

930
01:04:49,887 --> 01:04:52,888
- Okay, I'll be right there.

931
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:56,424
Puck, we've gotta go.

932
01:04:56,426 --> 01:04:58,793
Barry! Where is your brother?

933
01:04:58,795 --> 01:05:01,096
Puck, go put on a clean shirt.

934
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:04,399
- Paging Dr.
Porter. Paging Dr. Porter.

935
01:05:04,401 --> 01:05:08,270
Dr. Porter, please
pick up a red phone.

936
01:05:11,941 --> 01:05:13,341
- Frank.

937
01:05:14,043 --> 01:05:15,377
- Hey.

938
01:05:15,678 --> 01:05:17,245
It's okay. He's okay.

939
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:21,016
Your dad's okay. He
had his seatbelt on.

940
01:05:21,018 --> 01:05:22,951
- I was so upset.

941
01:05:23,619 --> 01:05:26,187
He was so angry.

942
01:05:26,189 --> 01:05:26,922
- I know.

943
01:05:26,924 --> 01:05:31,126
Jake hasn't been himself
for some time now.

944
01:05:31,128 --> 01:05:32,661
To be honest,

945
01:05:32,663 --> 01:05:34,296
I've almost had to fire him,

946
01:05:34,298 --> 01:05:35,063
more than once.

947
01:05:35,065 --> 01:05:36,698
Don't worry, his job is safe.

948
01:05:36,700 --> 01:05:39,868
When he's straight, he's the
best worker I've ever had.

949
01:05:39,870 --> 01:05:43,305
But, something is
eating him up inside.

950
01:05:43,307 --> 01:05:46,508
If we don't help him beat
whatever demons he's fighting,

951
01:05:46,510 --> 01:05:49,544
it's just gonna get worse.

952
01:05:49,546 --> 01:05:50,979
- Miss Carrie.
- - Yeah.

953
01:05:50,981 --> 01:05:53,815
- Your husband's gonna be okay.

954
01:05:53,817 --> 01:05:55,984
- I'll stay here.

955
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:13,101
- I'm sorry, baby.

956
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:19,941
I love you.

957
01:06:19,943 --> 01:06:22,477
- I love you, too.

958
01:06:44,433 --> 01:06:47,702
- Okay.
- We'll be all right.

959
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:53,108
- Here you go, Therese.

960
01:06:53,110 --> 01:06:54,376
- Thanks.

961
01:06:54,477 --> 01:06:57,212
- Hey, Ruby.
How's Jake Knight doing?

962
01:06:57,214 --> 01:06:57,979
- He's in some pain,

963
01:06:57,981 --> 01:07:00,749
but I'm ordering him
some pain medicine.

964
01:07:00,751 --> 01:07:01,649
- Okay, good.

965
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:03,451
It could've been a lot worse.

966
01:07:03,453 --> 01:07:06,254
Must have a guardian
angel, that's for sure.

967
01:07:06,256 --> 01:07:07,756
- Yes sir, Doc.

968
01:07:07,758 --> 01:07:08,623
- I'll be in Room 3.

969
01:07:08,625 --> 01:07:11,026
- Thank you, Doctor.

970
01:07:14,497 --> 01:07:15,930
- Hey, Frank.

971
01:07:15,932 --> 01:07:18,066
- How's it going?

972
01:07:18,068 --> 01:07:20,101
- Oh, you know.

973
01:07:21,404 --> 01:07:23,104
Is Carrie here?

974
01:07:23,106 --> 01:07:25,373
- She went to get coffee.

975
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:28,576
Told her I'd hold down
the fort for a while.

976
01:07:28,578 --> 01:07:30,245
But, you know what?
I don't do bed pans.

977
01:07:30,247 --> 01:07:32,814
- Oh, man.

978
01:07:32,816 --> 01:07:37,018
I sure could go for one
of your greasy hamburgers.

979
01:07:37,020 --> 01:07:40,021
Spicy ketchup, mustard.

980
01:07:40,023 --> 01:07:42,690
- Ask, and you shall receive.

981
01:07:43,659 --> 01:07:46,428
- Seek, and you shall find.

982
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:49,731
- Knock, and the
door shall be opened.

983
01:07:49,733 --> 01:07:53,201
- Look at you. I didn't know
you knew any Bible verses.

984
01:07:53,203 --> 01:07:56,638
- Yeah, well, Pops.

985
01:07:59,308 --> 01:08:03,044
- Hey. Don't tell Miss Ruby.

986
01:08:04,647 --> 01:08:07,449
- We'll get you
back on your feet.

987
01:08:07,850 --> 01:08:09,951
There's a little
something extra in there

988
01:08:09,953 --> 01:08:11,853
to help you out.

989
01:08:15,291 --> 01:08:17,592
- I can't take this.

990
01:08:20,362 --> 01:08:21,096
- It'll help out,

991
01:08:21,098 --> 01:08:25,700
but it's not gonna
fix your problem.

992
01:08:27,069 --> 01:08:31,206
- Yeah, well thanks
for the hamburger.

993
01:08:31,907 --> 01:08:35,743
- I am not gonna let
you off that easy, Jake.

994
01:08:36,645 --> 01:08:39,314
There are people
who care about you.

995
01:08:39,316 --> 01:08:41,916
They worry about what
you're doing to your life.

996
01:08:41,918 --> 01:08:45,753
They wanna help you, and
you can't even see that.

997
01:08:47,089 --> 01:08:49,023
You're walking
down Gallows Road.

998
01:08:49,025 --> 01:08:52,260
I know, 'cause I've
been there myself.

999
01:08:53,762 --> 01:08:56,264
It's a dark road, son.

1000
01:08:56,999 --> 01:09:00,768
It's like you're blindfolded.

1001
01:09:02,104 --> 01:09:03,938
When you get to the
end of that road,

1002
01:09:03,940 --> 01:09:08,710
there's these wooden
steps you have to go up.

1003
01:09:08,712 --> 01:09:10,845
It's like you're in quicksand.

1004
01:09:10,847 --> 01:09:14,749
You're just sinking
deeper and deeper.

1005
01:09:15,584 --> 01:09:17,752
When you get to the
top, there's a scaffold

1006
01:09:17,754 --> 01:09:19,954
with a rope hanging on it.

1007
01:09:19,956 --> 01:09:22,257
The rope makes this...

1008
01:09:22,758 --> 01:09:23,992
high-pitched screeching sound

1009
01:09:23,994 --> 01:09:29,297
as that knot digs into
the side of your neck.

1010
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:35,503
Just like that, your
feet are free of land.

1011
01:09:36,639 --> 01:09:38,573
Snap.

1012
01:09:39,408 --> 01:09:40,742
You break.

1013
01:09:40,876 --> 01:09:46,214
The most important thing about
Gallows Road, Jake, is this.

1014
01:09:46,216 --> 01:09:49,284
That blindfold that
you're wearing,

1015
01:09:49,286 --> 01:09:52,153
you put it there yourself.

1016
01:09:53,222 --> 01:09:55,089
You can't be pointing fingers

1017
01:09:55,091 --> 01:10:00,261
and blaming everyone
else for your problems.

1018
01:10:00,996 --> 01:10:03,598
You wanna make your life better?

1019
01:10:03,600 --> 01:10:05,033
Then, do it.

1020
01:10:05,035 --> 01:10:06,801
Get off that road.

1021
01:10:06,803 --> 01:10:10,004
You can turn back
any time you want.

1022
01:10:10,006 --> 01:10:13,908
But, you're the one that's
gotta take that first step.

1023
01:10:21,917 --> 01:10:23,785
- I was there.

1024
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:27,455
I just stood and watched.

1025
01:10:27,457 --> 01:10:29,390
- Watched what?

1026
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:33,061
- Matty Cain threw
a flaming torch

1027
01:10:33,063 --> 01:10:35,763
at Bob Collin's porch.

1028
01:10:36,365 --> 01:10:38,833
I tried to help 'em,

1029
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:41,302
but Snake put a gun to my chest.

1030
01:10:41,304 --> 01:10:43,271
- That was an accident,

1031
01:10:43,273 --> 01:10:44,672
so they say.

1032
01:10:44,674 --> 01:10:46,274
- Yeah.

1033
01:10:47,243 --> 01:10:48,743
So they say.

1034
01:10:48,745 --> 01:10:50,378
- Yeah.

1035
01:10:51,080 --> 01:10:54,215
- What's worse
than a man dying...

1036
01:10:55,918 --> 01:10:58,653
is not being able to live.

1037
01:11:01,423 --> 01:11:03,157
I'm a coward, Frank.

1038
01:11:03,159 --> 01:11:05,460
- You're not a coward.

1039
01:11:05,462 --> 01:11:09,130
You made a mistake. Fix it.

1040
01:11:09,132 --> 01:11:10,932
- I ain't worth fixing.

1041
01:11:10,934 --> 01:11:12,500
I'm already gone.

1042
01:11:12,502 --> 01:11:14,002
- Nobody gone.

1043
01:11:14,004 --> 01:11:16,170
You're off course, that's all.

1044
01:11:16,172 --> 01:11:19,140
- I can't sleep. I can't work.

1045
01:11:19,142 --> 01:11:22,877
I can't get through a
day without drinking.

1046
01:11:25,114 --> 01:11:27,315
I keep seeing them two kids,

1047
01:11:27,317 --> 01:11:30,251
and that man's poor wife.

1048
01:11:30,919 --> 01:11:34,722
My kids, they don't know me.

1049
01:11:36,292 --> 01:11:40,695
And my wife, she's afraid of me.

1050
01:11:43,966 --> 01:11:47,635
I wish I could take
that night back, Frank,

1051
01:11:47,637 --> 01:11:49,370
but I can't.

1052
01:11:49,638 --> 01:11:51,839
- There ain't no sin...

1053
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:55,910
greater than God's
forgiveness, Jake.

1054
01:11:55,912 --> 01:11:58,279
- Forgiveness?

1055
01:11:59,148 --> 01:12:02,016
So, God's gonna forgive me,

1056
01:12:02,018 --> 01:12:04,018
just like that?

1057
01:12:05,287 --> 01:12:06,788
- Yeah.

1058
01:12:07,189 --> 01:12:09,357
Just like that.

1059
01:12:11,160 --> 01:12:14,562
Says so right here
in the Good Book.

1060
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:20,702
You know how you get it?

1061
01:12:22,171 --> 01:12:23,705
- How?

1062
01:12:24,106 --> 01:12:26,341
- You just ask.

1063
01:12:42,658 --> 01:12:44,625
- Hey, Shep.

1064
01:12:44,627 --> 01:12:46,194
Come on now.

1065
01:12:46,196 --> 01:12:49,330
Hey, boy, I got your favorite.

1066
01:12:49,332 --> 01:12:52,800
Here. Here you go, Shep.

1067
01:12:53,635 --> 01:12:54,869
Shep?

1068
01:12:55,738 --> 01:12:57,338
Shep?

1069
01:12:58,474 --> 01:13:00,641
Shep, come on now.

1070
01:13:00,643 --> 01:13:03,611
Here, it's your favorite.

1071
01:13:07,249 --> 01:13:09,984
Shep. Come on, Shep.

1072
01:13:11,186 --> 01:13:12,887
Come on, Shep.

1073
01:13:13,956 --> 01:13:16,691
Don't you die on me, too.

1074
01:13:16,693 --> 01:13:18,926
Aw, Shep.

1075
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:22,864
Shep.

1076
01:15:07,102 --> 01:15:09,203
- Bay came to see me.

1077
01:15:10,138 --> 01:15:12,840
- He found you, huh?

1078
01:15:13,542 --> 01:15:15,710
- Yeah, he found me.

1079
01:15:16,545 --> 01:15:18,546
He's a good boy.

1080
01:15:18,548 --> 01:15:21,482
You all doing a
good job with him.

1081
01:15:22,684 --> 01:15:25,219
He gettin' tall.

1082
01:15:25,221 --> 01:15:29,323
Maybe gonna be as
big as his daddy.

1083
01:15:29,325 --> 01:15:31,392
- So, what you saying?

1084
01:15:31,394 --> 01:15:33,728
- Just saying.

1085
01:15:40,335 --> 01:15:42,937
- I'm real sorry, Bob.

1086
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:45,540
- Know what I remember?

1087
01:15:45,542 --> 01:15:49,210
It was really hot that night.

1088
01:15:51,313 --> 01:15:54,582
I can still smell the flowers.

1089
01:15:56,451 --> 01:15:59,620
My wife was looking nice.

1090
01:16:01,356 --> 01:16:03,524
Mary and Michael...

1091
01:16:05,460 --> 01:16:07,795
Those kids...

1092
01:16:09,264 --> 01:16:11,632
were the sunshine of my life.

1093
01:16:11,634 --> 01:16:13,701
- I know.

1094
01:16:13,703 --> 01:16:15,903
We all miss 'em.

1095
01:16:16,572 --> 01:16:19,407
Life just isn't fair.

1096
01:16:19,409 --> 01:16:22,944
- You don't know.

1097
01:16:25,847 --> 01:16:27,915
But, you're right.

1098
01:16:30,218 --> 01:16:32,787
Life just isn't fair.

1099
01:16:33,088 --> 01:16:36,791
- Bobby, you ever think
about forgiving that boy?

1100
01:16:36,793 --> 01:16:38,459
- What boy?

1101
01:16:38,461 --> 01:16:39,327
- Jake.

1102
01:16:39,329 --> 01:16:42,797
He got a little girl, young.

1103
01:16:43,098 --> 01:16:45,299
You ever think about
the pain and the guilt

1104
01:16:45,301 --> 01:16:46,834
that he has to live with?

1105
01:16:46,836 --> 01:16:50,938
- You ever think about what
I have to live without?

1106
01:16:52,708 --> 01:16:54,709
I lost...

1107
01:16:57,346 --> 01:16:59,313
my two kids.

1108
01:17:00,949 --> 01:17:02,917
My wife.

1109
01:17:05,621 --> 01:17:07,855
What about my kids?

1110
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:12,893
They should be out playing.

1111
01:17:12,895 --> 01:17:14,895
Me and the kids.

1112
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:20,167
What about my wife?

1113
01:17:23,605 --> 01:17:26,641
Who I got to come home to?

1114
01:17:36,218 --> 01:17:38,119
- You...

1115
01:17:38,987 --> 01:17:40,488
You could go back
off in them woods

1116
01:17:40,490 --> 01:17:44,325
and hide in your cave,
your safe place...

1117
01:17:46,328 --> 01:17:49,196
like I did when Dad died.

1118
01:17:53,435 --> 01:17:56,537
Or you can put God here,

1119
01:17:56,539 --> 01:17:58,305
right here.

1120
01:17:58,840 --> 01:18:02,877
'Cause when you got God,
you're safe anywhere.

1121
01:18:04,346 --> 01:18:06,747
Now, I know I can't
make you do nothing

1122
01:18:06,749 --> 01:18:09,650
that you don't wanna do.

1123
01:18:10,152 --> 01:18:13,954
But, you gotta keep
moving, big brother.

1124
01:18:18,593 --> 01:18:21,696
You walked out on me, Bobby.

1125
01:18:23,832 --> 01:18:26,567
You walked out on me

1126
01:18:26,569 --> 01:18:28,936
and this store.

1127
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:30,538
Our store.

1128
01:18:30,540 --> 01:18:33,407
You runnin' and hidin'
off in them woods.

1129
01:18:33,409 --> 01:18:36,777
You ain't doing nobody no good.

1130
01:18:37,345 --> 01:18:41,148
You ain't got to run
and hide no more, Bobby.

1131
01:18:42,017 --> 01:18:43,617
You got friends and family

1132
01:18:43,619 --> 01:18:47,188
that love you and miss you.

1133
01:18:47,190 --> 01:18:50,925
I'm your only brother, Bobby.

1134
01:18:53,095 --> 01:18:55,396
I miss you.

1135
01:18:57,866 --> 01:18:59,734
Please.

1136
01:19:03,038 --> 01:19:05,005
Please...

1137
01:19:05,373 --> 01:19:07,541
come to church
with me this Sunday

1138
01:19:07,543 --> 01:19:10,945
just like old times.

1139
01:19:13,615 --> 01:19:17,585
- That what you
think I been doing?

1140
01:19:17,587 --> 01:19:19,253
Hiding?

1141
01:19:20,922 --> 01:19:25,359
You ain't got to go to
no church to talk to God.

1142
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:29,897
I been talking to God.

1143
01:19:32,067 --> 01:19:35,002
I made me some decision.

1144
01:19:37,372 --> 01:19:40,007
I'm gonna kill them boy.

1145
01:19:40,909 --> 01:19:43,110
All three of 'em.

1146
01:19:53,522 --> 01:19:56,023
Thanks for the licorice.

1147
01:20:41,604 --> 01:20:43,204
- Hello?

1148
01:20:44,739 --> 01:20:46,040
Hello?

1149
01:20:47,175 --> 01:20:48,876
- Jessie.

1150
01:20:49,578 --> 01:20:51,512
- Seth?
- - Yes.

1151
01:20:51,514 --> 01:20:54,014
- It's me, honey.

1152
01:20:54,482 --> 01:20:56,650
- Baby, you okay?

1153
01:20:56,652 --> 01:20:59,420
- I'm okay.

1154
01:20:59,721 --> 01:21:04,291
I just called to
tell you I love you.

1155
01:21:04,293 --> 01:21:06,460
- Bay, go to your room.

1156
01:21:09,331 --> 01:21:11,365
What's wrong?

1157
01:21:11,733 --> 01:21:13,834
- It's Bob.

1158
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:18,172
- What do you mean?

1159
01:21:18,174 --> 01:21:21,408
- He knows they coming for him.

1160
01:21:21,410 --> 01:21:23,143
He's gonna kill 'em, Jessie.

1161
01:21:23,145 --> 01:21:26,380
- Baby?
- - I gotta go.

1162
01:21:27,983 --> 01:21:30,284
- Where are you going?

1163
01:21:31,453 --> 01:21:33,053
Seth.

1164
01:21:40,528 --> 01:21:42,162
Bay!

1165
01:22:11,726 --> 01:22:15,829
- I'm gonna smoke
that man out like a rat,

1166
01:22:15,831 --> 01:22:17,765
finish what we started.

1167
01:22:17,767 --> 01:22:21,068
- And you're
sure you wanna do this?

1168
01:22:23,738 --> 01:22:26,140
- I never been more.

1169
01:22:42,991 --> 01:22:45,292
- Forgive me, God.

1170
01:22:52,567 --> 01:22:56,103
- One, two, three, four.

1171
01:22:56,105 --> 01:22:56,770
- Okay!

1172
01:22:56,772 --> 01:22:58,539
- Now, we're even.
- Killed ya.

1173
01:22:58,541 --> 01:23:00,407
- Let's play again.

1174
01:23:07,682 --> 01:23:11,018
- Jake Knight's room, please?

1175
01:23:12,587 --> 01:23:14,188
Jake?

1176
01:23:14,322 --> 01:23:16,423
Someone's been here.

1177
01:23:16,425 --> 01:23:17,992
- Where?

1178
01:23:17,994 --> 01:23:19,626
- Our house.

1179
01:23:19,628 --> 01:23:22,029
I was taking the trash out,

1180
01:23:22,031 --> 01:23:24,665
- and I...
- Carrie?

1181
01:23:24,667 --> 01:23:26,200
- I'm coming home.

1182
01:23:26,202 --> 01:23:28,035
- Jake?

1183
01:23:35,477 --> 01:23:38,145
- Okay, good. Ms. Combs
seems to be doing better.

1184
01:23:38,147 --> 01:23:38,946
Vitals are good.

1185
01:23:38,948 --> 01:23:40,581
Let's go ahead and
take her off Demerol,

1186
01:23:40,583 --> 01:23:42,149
switch her to Tylenol.

1187
01:23:42,151 --> 01:23:42,850
- Okay.

1188
01:23:42,852 --> 01:23:45,352
- Mr. Knights. Okay, good.

1189
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:47,354
His x-ray, CT came
back negative.

1190
01:23:47,356 --> 01:23:49,523
Still wanna monitor
him one more day.

1191
01:23:49,525 --> 01:23:52,259
If he's tolerating liquids,
just remove his IV.

1192
01:23:52,261 --> 01:23:52,960
- Yes, sir.

1193
01:23:52,962 --> 01:23:54,395
- Hello, this is Frank.

1194
01:23:54,397 --> 01:23:55,763
- Hey, Frank.

1195
01:23:55,765 --> 01:23:56,897
I need to borrow
another work truck.

1196
01:23:56,899 --> 01:23:58,899
- What're you
doing outta the hospital?

1197
01:23:58,901 --> 01:23:59,767
You need your rest.

1198
01:23:59,769 --> 01:24:00,734
- I can rest when this is over.

1199
01:24:00,736 --> 01:24:02,236
- No, Jake. Listen to me.

1200
01:24:02,238 --> 01:24:04,438
Jake. Jake, what're you doing?

1201
01:24:04,440 --> 01:24:05,305
- I gotta go.

1202
01:24:05,307 --> 01:24:08,242
- Jake. Jake!

1203
01:24:47,082 --> 01:24:49,783
- Barry.
- - Dad?

1204
01:24:51,352 --> 01:24:52,953
- Are you okay?!

1205
01:24:52,955 --> 01:24:54,588
- I'm okay.

1206
01:24:55,056 --> 01:24:56,290
Puck.

1207
01:25:04,265 --> 01:25:06,767
Show me what you saw.

1208
01:25:18,079 --> 01:25:20,447
Carrie, I want you
to listen to me.

1209
01:25:20,449 --> 01:25:23,016
When I leave, I want you
to take Barry and Puck

1210
01:25:23,018 --> 01:25:25,652
into the bedroom
and lock that door.

1211
01:25:25,654 --> 01:25:26,553
- Okay.

1212
01:25:26,555 --> 01:25:28,689
- I want you to
lock the front door,

1213
01:25:28,691 --> 01:25:30,390
- and I'll be back soon.
- - Okay.

1214
01:25:30,392 --> 01:25:32,759
- I'm afraid, Jake.

1215
01:25:33,528 --> 01:25:35,329
- Don't be.

1216
01:25:35,331 --> 01:25:36,063
- Okay.

1217
01:25:36,065 --> 01:25:38,332
- We're a family.

1218
01:25:38,334 --> 01:25:40,601
You understand me?

1219
01:25:40,603 --> 01:25:43,103
We're a family.

1220
01:26:05,026 --> 01:26:06,527
- Seth?

1221
01:26:08,897 --> 01:26:10,797
- Preacher Sam.

1222
01:26:14,536 --> 01:26:16,803
Can we talk?

1223
01:26:17,205 --> 01:26:19,139
- Sure.

1224
01:26:21,776 --> 01:26:24,344
- My brother come to me.

1225
01:26:25,480 --> 01:26:29,183
He told me something
very unsettling.

1226
01:26:30,418 --> 01:26:31,585
- Seth?

1227
01:26:31,587 --> 01:26:35,889
- He said he gonna
kill them Cain boys,

1228
01:26:35,891 --> 01:26:36,957
and Jake, too.

1229
01:26:36,959 --> 01:26:39,526
- He can't do that, Seth.

1230
01:26:39,528 --> 01:26:41,695
- Oh, he can.

1231
01:26:42,597 --> 01:26:44,531
And, he will.

1232
01:26:44,533 --> 01:26:46,667
He ain't got nothing
left to lose.

1233
01:26:46,669 --> 01:26:50,337
- You go to the
person who wronged you,

1234
01:26:50,339 --> 01:26:53,173
and forgive them.

1235
01:26:53,608 --> 01:26:58,879
- Preacher Sam, you and I
both know it ain't that easy.

1236
01:27:00,415 --> 01:27:03,317
They took his little boy.

1237
01:27:04,419 --> 01:27:06,920
They took his little girl.

1238
01:27:08,523 --> 01:27:11,291
And they took his wife.

1239
01:27:13,127 --> 01:27:17,764
And I'm starting to
take it real personal.

1240
01:27:18,833 --> 01:27:22,302
- Seth, I'm here
for you, always.

1241
01:27:22,304 --> 01:27:24,905
- But, if you was me...

1242
01:27:27,308 --> 01:27:29,610
what would you do?

1243
01:27:31,512 --> 01:27:34,915
- I'd have to ask
you to pray for me.

1244
01:28:05,813 --> 01:28:07,781
- There he is, Carl!

1245
01:28:12,053 --> 01:28:13,720
You had me scared to death.

1246
01:28:13,722 --> 01:28:15,188
Are you okay?

1247
01:28:15,190 --> 01:28:17,557
- I'm sorry, Mama.

1248
01:28:17,925 --> 01:28:19,526
- Come on. Take me to Bob.

1249
01:28:19,528 --> 01:28:21,795
- Yes, ma'am.

1250
01:28:30,104 --> 01:28:33,006
- Forgive us our trespasses,

1251
01:28:33,008 --> 01:28:37,144
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

1252
01:28:37,146 --> 01:28:40,414
But, lead us not
into temptation.

1253
01:28:41,015 --> 01:28:43,950
For thine is the kingdom,

1254
01:28:44,519 --> 01:28:46,920
the power,

1255
01:28:48,656 --> 01:28:50,957
and the glory.

1256
01:28:53,394 --> 01:28:54,528
Amen.

1257
01:29:18,586 --> 01:29:21,421
- Why don't you come
on out in the light, Bob?

1258
01:29:21,423 --> 01:29:23,757
Where I can see you.

1259
01:29:24,625 --> 01:29:27,027
- You took my family, my blood!

1260
01:29:27,029 --> 01:29:27,928
Took 'em from me.

1261
01:29:27,930 --> 01:29:29,763
- Come on now, Bob.

1262
01:29:29,765 --> 01:29:33,834
You gonna sit there nice
and quiet, and burn.

1263
01:29:36,104 --> 01:29:39,239
Just like your
wife and kids did.

1264
01:29:39,241 --> 01:29:40,507
- Gonna kill you, Snake,

1265
01:29:40,509 --> 01:29:43,477
you and your brother there.

1266
01:29:45,613 --> 01:29:50,617
You all ain't gonna do
no harm to nobody...

1267
01:29:50,619 --> 01:29:52,352
no more.

1268
01:29:59,827 --> 01:30:01,962
- Why?

1269
01:30:03,097 --> 01:30:05,399
- This ain't about no store.

1270
01:30:05,401 --> 01:30:06,600
- You're right though.

1271
01:30:06,602 --> 01:30:08,201
I just don't like you.

1272
01:30:08,203 --> 01:30:10,303
I don't like your family.

1273
01:30:10,305 --> 01:30:12,839
I don't like your kind.

1274
01:30:12,841 --> 01:30:16,109
But, I tell you
what it is about.

1275
01:30:16,111 --> 01:30:18,044
It's about the blood.

1276
01:30:18,379 --> 01:30:20,881
It's about the scavengers.

1277
01:30:21,416 --> 01:30:25,552
And it's about your
blood to spill.

1278
01:30:25,554 --> 01:30:27,754
- You're pure hate.

1279
01:30:27,756 --> 01:30:30,390
May God forgive you.

1280
01:30:31,192 --> 01:30:34,227
- Never was no God in my world.

1281
01:30:34,229 --> 01:30:35,896
- My God.

1282
01:30:36,431 --> 01:30:39,132
You're gonna wish there was.

1283
01:30:39,134 --> 01:30:40,667
- This is my
battle, little brother.

1284
01:30:40,669 --> 01:30:43,470
- It's our battle, bro.

1285
01:30:49,577 --> 01:30:51,077
- Put the gun down, Snake.

1286
01:30:51,079 --> 01:30:53,980
- Two birds, one gun.

1287
01:31:04,525 --> 01:31:04,825
Matty.

1288
01:31:04,827 --> 01:31:08,728
Put that gun on Bob's
little brother here.

1289
01:31:08,730 --> 01:31:10,530
Matty!

1290
01:31:10,998 --> 01:31:13,667
- Sheriff. 10-33.

1291
01:31:14,001 --> 01:31:18,205
We have three armed suspects
inside the old Aledo mill.

1292
01:31:18,207 --> 01:31:19,172
They're in a standoff position,

1293
01:31:19,174 --> 01:31:20,507
and they have their
weapons drawn.

1294
01:31:20,509 --> 01:31:21,475
- Copy that.

1295
01:31:21,477 --> 01:31:22,008
Hold the perimeter.

1296
01:31:22,010 --> 01:31:24,978
Do not make a move until I
get there. I'm on my way.

1297
01:31:24,980 --> 01:31:27,380
- David 927, I'll be en route.

1298
01:31:27,382 --> 01:31:28,281
- Sheriff.

1299
01:31:28,283 --> 01:31:31,184
Snake, Matty, and Jake...

1300
01:31:31,186 --> 01:31:32,853
They're in there
with Bob Collins.

1301
01:31:32,855 --> 01:31:36,156
- I heard you the first
time, Gibby. Do not move!

1302
01:31:36,158 --> 01:31:39,025
I'm on my way. Confirmed.

1303
01:31:40,761 --> 01:31:41,962
Gibby.

1304
01:31:42,763 --> 01:31:43,663
Gibby!

1305
01:31:56,410 --> 01:31:58,011
- Who's this?

1306
01:31:58,013 --> 01:31:59,746
- My husband is
in there, isn't he, Carl?

1307
01:31:59,748 --> 01:32:00,780
- Jessie, stay in.
- You tell me.

1308
01:32:00,782 --> 01:32:01,615
- He's in there, isn't he?

1309
01:32:01,617 --> 01:32:03,550
- I don't know...
- No, no, no!

1310
01:32:03,552 --> 01:32:04,284
- Jessie!

1311
01:32:04,286 --> 01:32:06,620
Your husband is inside.
Weapons are drawn.

1312
01:32:06,622 --> 01:32:08,588
I need you to stay calm.

1313
01:32:08,590 --> 01:32:09,422
- Uncle Bob!

1314
01:32:09,424 --> 01:32:11,658
- Bay? Where's Bay?!

1315
01:32:11,660 --> 01:32:12,826
- Papa!
- - Bay!

1316
01:32:12,828 --> 01:32:14,227
- Bay! Go on
and get outta here!

1317
01:32:14,229 --> 01:32:15,562
- No, Papa! Don't do this!

1318
01:32:15,564 --> 01:32:17,497
- Run! Get outta here now!

1319
01:32:17,499 --> 01:32:18,331
- No, Papa.

1320
01:32:18,333 --> 01:32:19,432
Not without you or Uncle Bob.

1321
01:32:19,434 --> 01:32:21,768
- Let me go!

1322
01:32:22,436 --> 01:32:25,071
If something happens
to my husband or child,

1323
01:32:25,073 --> 01:32:26,907
I'll come after you myself.

1324
01:32:26,909 --> 01:32:30,043
You will feel from a
woman like you have never!

1325
01:32:30,045 --> 01:32:32,345
- Don't you
have a mama or papa?

1326
01:32:32,347 --> 01:32:36,516
I know if you did,
they would miss you.

1327
01:32:36,518 --> 01:32:37,751
Forgive.

1328
01:32:37,753 --> 01:32:39,986
I forgive you!

1329
01:32:42,723 --> 01:32:43,957
- Snake?

1330
01:32:46,328 --> 01:32:48,662
- No!

1331
01:33:03,444 --> 01:33:05,645
- Put your weapons down!

1332
01:33:05,647 --> 01:33:06,580
- Are you okay?

1333
01:33:06,582 --> 01:33:08,982
- On the ground now!

1334
01:33:10,251 --> 01:33:11,384
Hands above you head!

1335
01:33:11,386 --> 01:33:13,820
Do it now! Do it now!

1336
01:33:13,822 --> 01:33:15,555
Snake?

1337
01:33:19,961 --> 01:33:22,896
- I got one in custody.

1338
01:33:24,565 --> 01:33:26,967
- Please. Please, Bob.

1339
01:33:26,969 --> 01:33:29,202
Please forgive me.

1340
01:33:29,204 --> 01:33:31,838
- I already have, son.

1341
01:33:46,120 --> 01:33:49,222
- Snake, don't
leave me, brother.

1342
01:33:49,224 --> 01:33:51,925
I don't want to
be the last wolf.

1343
01:33:51,927 --> 01:33:52,826
- Start
medical, we got one here

1344
01:33:52,828 --> 01:33:55,762
with a gunshot wound,
left chest, one down.

1345
01:33:55,764 --> 01:33:56,930
Stay with me, man. Stay with me.

1346
01:33:56,932 --> 01:34:00,000
Tell 'em to step it up.
We need 'em code out here.

1347
01:34:01,370 --> 01:34:03,336
Talk to me. Come on, talk to me.

1348
01:34:03,338 --> 01:34:06,006
Come on. Stay with me.

1349
01:34:37,538 --> 01:34:39,239
- Hey, Bob.

1350
01:34:41,475 --> 01:34:43,143
- Hey, Seth.

1351
01:34:44,445 --> 01:34:47,113
- You ready to do this?

1352
01:34:48,015 --> 01:34:50,216
- I guess so.

1353
01:34:51,285 --> 01:34:54,454
- Let's get going then.

1354
01:34:54,456 --> 01:34:55,989
Hey, kids!

1355
01:34:55,991 --> 01:34:58,725
Your Uncle Bob is here.

1356
01:34:58,893 --> 01:35:01,561
- Hey.
- - Hey.

1357
01:35:01,563 --> 01:35:03,930
- Bay. Hi, Maji.

1358
01:35:03,932 --> 01:35:05,699
- Hey, Bob!

1359
01:35:06,333 --> 01:35:07,934
- Hi, Jessie.

1360
01:35:07,936 --> 01:35:09,569
- Today is a good day.

1361
01:35:09,571 --> 01:35:11,905
- It is, Jessie.

1362
01:35:14,608 --> 01:35:16,042
- Why don't you all go on ahead,

1363
01:35:16,044 --> 01:35:17,610
and give us a moment.

1364
01:35:17,612 --> 01:35:19,612
- Sure. Come on, kids.

1365
01:35:19,614 --> 01:35:24,084
Let's go. We'll
leave you two alone.

1366
01:35:30,624 --> 01:35:31,491
- I just...

1367
01:35:31,493 --> 01:35:35,895
need a few moments
to catch my breath.

1368
01:35:38,799 --> 01:35:40,800
I don't know if I can do this.

1369
01:35:40,802 --> 01:35:42,168
- Bob.

1370
01:35:43,437 --> 01:35:45,705
Yes, you can.

1371
01:35:47,842 --> 01:35:49,876
Look, I...

1372
01:35:50,811 --> 01:35:52,979
I was saving this

1373
01:35:52,981 --> 01:35:55,915
for just the right moment.

1374
01:36:01,288 --> 01:36:05,325
Little welcome-back
gift from the family.

1375
01:36:05,327 --> 01:36:09,028
You know you can't
ignore God, Bob.

1376
01:36:10,131 --> 01:36:12,031
- Yeah, that is...

1377
01:36:13,567 --> 01:36:15,368
hard to do.

1378
01:36:30,050 --> 01:36:32,018
- See ya there?

1379
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:33,753
- Oh, yeah.

1380
01:36:33,755 --> 01:36:35,221
I'll be there.

1381
01:37:33,314 --> 01:37:35,582
- Today is a very important day

1382
01:37:35,584 --> 01:37:37,350
in our community.

1383
01:37:37,651 --> 01:37:40,587
We welcome back a member.

1384
01:37:40,589 --> 01:37:41,588
Bob Collins.

1385
01:37:48,229 --> 01:37:49,896
When you hear the
word community,

1386
01:37:49,898 --> 01:37:53,132
oftentimes you think
of it as small.

1387
01:37:53,134 --> 01:37:55,468
But, we're not small here.

1388
01:37:55,470 --> 01:37:57,770
We have big hearts,

1389
01:37:57,772 --> 01:37:59,505
big dreams,

1390
01:37:59,507 --> 01:38:00,840
hard-working people

1391
01:38:00,842 --> 01:38:05,612
all working together to improve
the lives of our families.

1392
01:38:05,614 --> 01:38:09,115
In a city, whether
small or large,

1393
01:38:09,117 --> 01:38:11,651
there's a common thread.

1394
01:38:11,653 --> 01:38:13,953
Together, we struggle.

1395
01:38:13,955 --> 01:38:16,256
And together, we love.

1396
01:38:16,258 --> 01:38:20,293
So together, today,

1397
01:38:20,295 --> 01:38:22,528
please join us

1398
01:38:22,530 --> 01:38:25,632
in celebrating the opening

1399
01:38:25,634 --> 01:38:28,868
of the Collins
brothers' antique store.

1400
01:38:28,870 --> 01:38:31,271
Bob, would you do the favor?

1401
01:38:31,273 --> 01:38:33,473
- I'd be honored.

1402
01:38:37,978 --> 01:38:40,647
All right.

1403
01:39:08,443 --> 01:39:10,410
- You did good, Jake.

1404
01:39:10,412 --> 01:39:13,146
- Thanks for not
giving up on me, Frank.

1405
01:39:13,148 --> 01:39:16,015
- I'm proud of you,
and so is your family.

1406
01:39:16,017 --> 01:39:18,117
You did the right thing.

1407
01:39:18,119 --> 01:39:19,919
- Well, I'm staying here.

1408
01:39:19,921 --> 01:39:21,821
I'm not going anywhere.

1409
01:39:21,823 --> 01:39:23,589
With my family.

1410
01:39:23,591 --> 01:39:24,724
- I wanna go in
the antique store

1411
01:39:24,726 --> 01:39:27,360
- right now.
- - All right, let's go.

1412
01:39:31,265 --> 01:39:33,266
- Hey, what
about that bird call?

1413
01:39:33,268 --> 01:39:35,168
You were gonna teach me.

1414
01:39:35,170 --> 01:39:38,171
- Try this.

1415
01:39:38,173 --> 01:39:39,672
- My turn.

1416
01:39:41,743 --> 01:39:43,576
- We need to work on that.

1417
01:39:43,578 --> 01:39:46,846
- Okay, so my bird
call doesn't impress you,

1418
01:39:46,848 --> 01:39:50,049
but how about?

1419
01:39:50,051 --> 01:39:52,085
Here we go.
